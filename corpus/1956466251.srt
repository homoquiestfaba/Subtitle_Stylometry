is always the same.

It's some exaggerated
catalyst which turns the
existing world completely
upside down

3

which in turn, forces our so
called hero, to enter into
this new world of the unknown.

4
00:00:57,191 --> 00:01:01,229
He then predictably reaches
that infamous "all is lost"
moment,"

where there's just no more
hope.

6
00:01:03,897 --> 00:01:08,769
But it's how he deals with this
moment, that gives the audience
their emotional response.

00:01:09,937 --> 00:01:12,806

87
00:12:10,597 --> 00:12:13,500
Alright, so this's it.
This is what you've been waiting
for. This is the vest.

88
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,836
What you can do in your film,
your actor can wear this.

89
00:12:15,936 --> 00:12:17,137
Pay attention,
this is the rig.

90
00:12:17,237 --> 00:12:19,239
This my partner, Harry
Hawke designed this.

91
00:12:19,339 --> 00:12:22,575
This is the pack you
wear for the actors when
you do the stab scene.

92
00:12:22,675 --> 00:12:25,012
Now what it does, it goes
over the shoulders, comes
around the waist,

93
00:12:25,112 --> 00:12:28,849
Cool thing about this though
it's invincible. So if you stab
it with a knife, the blade can't
go through

94
00:12:28,949 --> 00:12:33,720
your actor's always protected.
So now you can get the wide shot
of the knife going in and it's
beautiful.

00:12:33,821 --> 00:12:37,090
Ah, when you're done,
reload your blood
pack, and, you guys
are ready to reshoot.

matter?

boys if we break the law. How's

for beating the crap
out of a prostitute.

109
00:13:08,121 --> 00:13:12,459

cocaine, it was the funner
stuff: meth, crystal,
crank, speed, glass.

Why not?
-That's ok.

talk around my daughter.

117
00:13:25,772 --> 00:13:27,107

some respect.

-You know what? Touching.

119

why don't you cry me some tears,

120
00:13:34,581 --> 00:13:38,151

"After-School Special?"

121
00:13:39,486 --> 00:13:40,687

122
00:13:40,787 --> 00:13:43,690

You played Brenda in the movie.
This is...this is, wow!

143
00:15:07,207 --> 00:15:09,309
You know, the first
film you did actually got
an X rating

144
00:15:09,409 --> 00:15:11,444
when it first
came out, because of the scene
that you did,

145
00:15:11,544 --> 00:15:13,580
they had to recut the entire
thing just to get an R

146
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:15,748
so it could be released in
theaters.
I'm sorry.

directing a film called
Deadpan and, Gabby
Stone's gonna be starring in it.

-It's actually Gabrielle
-Yeah, whatever.

153
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:37,404
Um, are you in
any way related to
Dee Wallace Stone?

154
00:15:37,504 --> 00:15:39,172

Ah, Dee Wallace Stone,
played the mom in E.T.

157
00:15:45,812 --> 00:15:48,048

what is that?

158

the matter with you?

00:15:51,751 --> 00:15:53,586
Wow, really?

160
00:15:57,324 --> 00:16:00,127
-So, Deadpan right?
Is that...
-Yes, uh huh.

161
00:16:01,328 --> 00:16:03,230
Sure.

162
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:09,036
Oh, ah...Oh wow! you guys are
actually shooting on 35 film.
That's, that's great.

163
00:16:09,136 --> 00:16:11,371
Yeah, you know it's
really the only
way to do it right.

164
00:16:11,471 --> 00:16:14,041
Do it right huh? Is that what
you're doing these days,
doing it right?

165
00:16:14,141 --> 00:16:15,842
You still, active?

166
00:16:15,942 --> 00:16:18,078
Active?

167
00:16:18,178 --> 00:16:19,612
Like physically?

168
00:16:19,712 --> 00:16:21,814
Well yeah, I do yoga, do
jogging.

169
00:16:21,914 --> 00:16:24,351
No I mean physically as in
sexually, like this shit.
You get that on?

170
00:16:24,451 --> 00:16:26,486
-Hey, you know what
-Gabrielle.
-No, It's fine.

171
00:16:26,586 --> 00:16:30,923
To actually work in this
business, it pays to have
a little bit of class
and act professional.

172
00:16:31,024 --> 00:16:33,126
Act professional?
Are you serious?

173
00:16:33,226 --> 00:16:36,896
First of all that's bull-shit In
this business it pays to sleep
with someone higher on the food
chain.

174
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:41,401
-Great!
-You know, it's really too bad
Thatabout the younger...now.

175
00:16:41,501 --> 00:16:44,171
generation of film-makers and
what they have become

176
00:16:44,271 --> 00:16:49,742
You know, they have no
respect for the craft,
none whatsoever because
it's so easy to do this,

177
00:16:49,842 --> 00:16:54,381
and any idiot with a
digital camera can call
themselves a film maker.

178
00:16:54,481 --> 00:16:56,516
Wow, you know is this
lecture Lane day? That's great!

179
00:16:56,616 --> 00:16:58,551
you guys are like part time
psychologists? I don't like
that.

180
00:16:58,651 --> 00:17:02,789
Ok, first of all I have a
nice tip for you: there's the
door, how's that sound, you like
that?

181
00:17:02,889 --> 00:17:07,026
Why don't you just
tell Richard that we
stopped by and uh,

182
00:17:07,127 --> 00:17:08,361
have him call me, ok?

183
00:17:08,461 --> 00:17:10,330
We'll tell good old
Dick you stopped by.

184
00:17:10,430 --> 00:17:13,800
We'll tell everyone
here in the office you
stopped by for Dick.
How's that sound huh?

185
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:14,934
Let's get out of here.

186
00:17:15,034 --> 00:17:16,403
Let's.

187
00:17:16,503 --> 00:17:17,937
Fucking asshole!

188
00:17:18,037 --> 00:17:20,807
Oh yea,
"It's a walk off.

189
00:17:20,907 --> 00:17:22,775
It's a walk off.
Remember that movie?

190
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:23,776
Seriously?
-Yeah.

191
00:17:23,876 --> 00:17:25,578
-Seriously?
-What?

192
00:17:25,678 --> 00:17:28,415
-You know I had
to beg Richard...
-Ah, da da da! I hate that
stupid story,

193
00:17:28,515 --> 00:17:30,783
I know You had to beg him, you
thought I would be an assest

194
00:17:30,883 --> 00:17:33,253
-Yea, I thought you
might be an asset.
-Yea, so? Doesn't matter.

195
00:17:33,353 --> 00:17:34,987
In about three weeks
we're gonna be
jobless anyway.

196
00:17:35,088 --> 00:17:37,557
-Why not go out in style?
-Yea, I think you'll go out
in style.

197
00:17:37,657 --> 00:17:40,560
I know I will.
I just did. You won't. Pansy.

198
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:43,563
Hi. Grow some balls. I have
church bells, you have tic-
tacs. How's that feel? Great
huh?

199
00:17:43,663 --> 00:17:47,200
-Wow.
-Yeah exactly. Oh by the way,
I saw you looking at Gabby.
You like her, don't you?

200
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:48,768
-Seriously?
-Yea

201
00:17:48,868 --> 00:17:51,471
that's why I went
for the other one, give
you a chance for once.

202
00:17:51,571 --> 00:17:55,007
Man up. How does it feel to not
be a man? Yeah, exactly.

203
00:17:55,108 --> 00:18:00,180
-I like brunettes.
-Oh ok. Good excuse. I like red
heads too, but guess what?

204
00:18:06,819 --> 00:18:08,721
Where's the light stand?

205
00:18:08,821 --> 00:18:10,790
Going up!

206
00:18:10,890 --> 00:18:13,460
I don't even know what I'm
supposed to be doing here.

207
00:18:18,097 --> 00:18:22,001
With all these chicks
around, this director is
trying to make himself
a cameo

208
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:24,271
put himself in the movie.

209
00:18:25,605 --> 00:18:27,407
I guess the
director can do whatever
he wants, right?

210
00:18:27,507 --> 00:18:30,977
Yea, If you're
Alfred Hitchcock.

211
00:18:31,077 --> 00:18:32,979
Sounds like something
Lane would do.

212
00:18:33,079 --> 00:18:34,714
I don't know why you
keep that guy around.

213
00:18:34,814 --> 00:18:35,815
Don't worry about me.

214
00:18:35,915 --> 00:18:37,950
I've got him
under control.

215
00:18:38,050 --> 00:18:40,253
Aren't you shooting video?
Richard wants to document
all this.

216
00:18:40,353 --> 00:18:42,021
I'm taking stills.

217
00:18:42,121 --> 00:18:43,656
Who's doing video?

218
00:18:44,324 --> 00:18:46,226
-Hey ladies!
-Hey
-Hey

219
00:18:46,326 --> 00:18:48,328
We're doing a little, kind of
behind the scenes DVD.

220
00:18:48,428 --> 00:18:52,365
Kind of bonus footage, you get
bored one night, you wanna stick
something in, you know?

221
00:18:52,465 --> 00:18:53,733
Cool.

222
00:18:53,833 --> 00:18:56,603
-Nice. You guys seem pretty
comfortable on camera.
-Yeah.

223
00:18:56,703 --> 00:18:59,672
-You guys ever work
together before?
-No, first time.
-first time.

224
00:18:59,772 --> 00:19:02,309
-First time for everything
right?
-I guess so.

225
00:19:02,409 --> 00:19:05,578
Good attitude, I like it.
I love it. You guys look
really...

226
00:19:05,678 --> 00:19:09,716
OK, Swimsuit ladies, I'm gonna
need you. Now. Let's go.

227
00:19:09,816 --> 00:19:10,650
Now.

228
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:11,584
Roundin'.

229
00:19:11,684 --> 00:19:12,685
Up.

230
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:21,561
No, no, no! What the hell are
you doing?

231
00:19:21,661 --> 00:19:25,398
This is supposed to
be a professional set!

232
00:19:25,498 --> 00:19:29,702
It's just a
camera setting. Look in your
monitor.It's fine! Jesus, I know
how to film.

233
00:19:31,738 --> 00:19:32,205
What's wrong man?

234
00:19:32,305 --> 00:19:33,473
Look at this guy...

235
00:19:33,573 --> 00:19:36,042
this director. He knows nothing
about film making

236
00:19:36,142 --> 00:19:40,647
Nothing. He can't set up a shot,
he can't direct an actor. He
doesn't know anything about it.

237
00:19:40,747 --> 00:19:44,384
But someone gave him all
this money to make this
big hot-rod car movie,

238
00:19:44,484 --> 00:19:49,188
and he hires these good looking
people with tits and ass, and he
thinks he's got something
special.

239
00:19:49,289 --> 00:19:50,557
Dude...

240
00:19:50,657 --> 00:19:53,560
Tits and
ass, that's kind of,
that's pretty special.

241
00:19:53,660 --> 00:19:55,528
I'm just saying.

242
00:19:55,628 --> 00:19:57,464
These girls let
me tape them.

243
00:19:57,564 --> 00:19:59,632
Thought I was part
of the production.

244
00:20:01,634 --> 00:20:02,969
Hey Lane.

245
00:20:03,069 --> 00:20:04,537
How's it going?

246
00:20:04,637 --> 00:20:07,907
You get some good
footage of the girls?

247
00:20:08,007 --> 00:20:12,945
I thought you would be
shooting the guys with
your prison background
and everything.

248
00:20:13,045 --> 00:20:15,382
But I guess
you didn't really see
that many guys, right?

249
00:20:15,482 --> 00:20:20,720
In prison, face down
in the pillow,
teeth full of pillow.

250
00:20:24,056 --> 00:20:28,127
Yea, nice head-lamp
fuck-stick. Who's taping girls?

251
00:20:28,227 --> 00:20:30,229
I am.

252
00:20:30,330 --> 00:20:34,667
Ooh, speaking of taping
girls, you gotta
see the prostitute
I taped last night.

253
00:20:34,767 --> 00:20:35,902
Hot!

254
00:20:38,371 --> 00:20:41,574
[loud sex sounds]

255
00:20:44,711 --> 00:20:46,879
[phone rings]

256
00:20:57,324 --> 00:20:58,891
Hey, what's up?

257
00:20:58,991 --> 00:21:00,460
Did you watch it?

258
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:05,164
Uh, yeah, I'm watching
it right now.

259
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:08,601
What did you think?
She's pretty hot, huh?

260
00:21:11,804 --> 00:21:15,808
There is absolutely no cinematic
value in anything that
you shot, alright?

261
00:21:15,908 --> 00:21:19,312
She doesn't even
stay in frame. This is
absolutely ridiculous.

262
00:21:19,412 --> 00:21:21,381
Yeah, but she's hot right?

263
00:21:23,616 --> 00:21:26,686
Ah, yeah. Yeah. I guess so.

264
00:21:26,786 --> 00:21:28,355
What are you
doing right now?

265
00:21:28,455 --> 00:21:30,957
I'm working on
a film project.

266
00:21:31,057 --> 00:21:31,991
Really?

267
00:21:32,091 --> 00:21:33,693
Yeah, after...

268
00:21:33,793 --> 00:21:36,996
being on that set tonight,
I started thinking about it,
you know, and

269
00:21:37,096 --> 00:21:41,668
and really, really reliving the
movies like Blair Witch or
Paranormal Activity

270
00:21:41,768 --> 00:21:44,170
and how they made those movies
for absolutely nothing.

271
00:21:44,270 --> 00:21:47,607
They shot them on
these cheap little video
cameras and I just

272
00:21:47,707 --> 00:21:49,842
you knonw, thought
you know maybe I could do
something like that.

273
00:21:49,942 --> 00:21:51,944
Where the hell you
gonna find actors?

274
00:21:52,044 --> 00:21:56,115
You know, maybe, maybe
get real people and just
scare them or something.

275
00:21:56,215 --> 00:21:58,985
I mean we have all the
equipment in our warehouse
to make whatever we want.

276
00:21:59,085 --> 00:22:01,521
Why don't we just
borrow some of that
gear and do that.

277
00:22:01,621 --> 00:22:03,222
We?

278
00:22:03,322 --> 00:22:06,125
Well, I could use
some help on this.

279
00:22:06,225 --> 00:22:09,796
-I don't know.
- Look, with everybody Richard
knows in distribution around
town,

280
00:22:09,896 --> 00:22:12,231
I'm sure we could get this thing
sold

281
00:22:12,331 --> 00:22:15,702
and, you know, probably make
some pretty good money,
if that's

282
00:22:15,802 --> 00:22:17,804
something you would be
interested in.

283
00:22:17,904 --> 00:22:20,206
Yeah, I will take
the money wherever
I can find it.

284
00:22:20,306 --> 00:22:22,975
-If you are down, man
let's just talk about
it in the morning.
- Cool.

285
00:22:23,075 --> 00:22:24,744
-Alright, talk to you then.

286
00:22:45,798 --> 00:22:47,834
Oh wow, you are
actually on time today.

287
00:22:48,968 --> 00:22:50,570
Alright, I have
been giving this
a lot of thought.

288
00:22:50,670 --> 00:22:52,872
I really think that our
idea of the movie can
work,

289
00:22:52,972 --> 00:22:55,274
but we gotta put a
little more thought into it.

290
00:22:55,374 --> 00:22:58,277
We can't just run and scare
somebody, because that's not a
movie.

291
00:22:58,377 --> 00:23:03,382
If we figure out a way to make
this come full circle, maybe
throw in a few twists, things
like that

292
00:23:03,483 --> 00:23:07,319
That's what wins an audience,
that's what makes it marketable,
that's what we have to do,
I mean

293
00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:11,524
if we had a girl in the middle
of a room and we run in with
a sheet on our head

294
00:23:11,624 --> 00:23:14,761
or a knife, ohhhh, I mean,
that's not
going to work.

295
00:23:14,861 --> 00:23:17,464
We need to get our angles
right so when the shoot
gets out of frame

296
00:23:17,564 --> 00:23:19,632
then we can have our sound
effects of the screamming,

297
00:23:19,732 --> 00:23:23,670
we can have the blood, the knife
coming through the frame,
whatever to make it look real.

298
00:23:23,770 --> 00:23:25,304
So...

299
00:23:25,404 --> 00:23:28,775
I was thinking about it
last night, I wrote this
script, I think that...

300
00:23:28,875 --> 00:23:30,443
OK, Hold on, stop, wait
just for a second.

301
00:23:30,543 --> 00:23:35,414
Look I know you are thirty
steps ahead of everybody
at all times, I get that,

302
00:23:35,515 --> 00:23:40,820
but this time...just stick a
camera in the corner somewhere
and capture it raw.

303
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:43,289
You can't go raw for this,
It's not going to work.

304
00:23:43,389 --> 00:23:44,924
Hey girls

305
00:23:46,526 --> 00:23:48,828
-How you doing?
-Good.
-Did you get some coffee?

306
00:23:48,928 --> 00:23:50,463
-Did you get some breakfast?
-Yeah.

307
00:23:50,563 --> 00:23:53,065
Yeah, because I
haven't had breakfast.
I have been here working, ok?

308
00:23:53,165 --> 00:23:56,569
I got this whole list,
of things, I gotta do today

309
00:23:56,669 --> 00:23:58,805
'Cause I am at work, that's what
I am doing, ok?

310
00:23:58,905 --> 00:24:01,307
This isn't the parole board, OK?

311
00:24:01,407 --> 00:24:04,711
It's not work furlough! We work
here. That's what we do. It's a
business.

312
00:24:04,811 --> 00:24:06,513
Alright, yeah OK. Got it.

313
00:24:06,613 --> 00:24:10,550
And just 'cause you are the boss
here for the next couple
of weeks,...just joking

314
00:24:10,650 --> 00:24:13,753
[laughing]
Just joking. But I'm serious.

315
00:24:13,853 --> 00:24:16,055
We gotta lot
of stuff to do and I
need you helping me.

316
00:24:16,155 --> 00:24:18,658
-I got it.
-And I'm doing it all by myself.
-Got it, yeah.

317
00:24:18,758 --> 00:24:21,728
so, if you could help,
that would be great.

318
00:24:21,828 --> 00:24:23,696
That's what you
are here for. Is to work.

319
00:24:23,796 --> 00:24:25,364
Guess what, you said that.
Got it. Got it.

320
00:24:25,464 --> 00:24:28,100
Alright, so I will see
you in about 10 seconds.

321
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:32,605
9, 8, 7, 6...

322
00:24:32,705 --> 00:24:35,141
I fucking hate that guy.

323
00:25:40,973 --> 00:25:43,643
Wow, step up from your place,
huh?

324
00:25:43,743 --> 00:25:46,078
Figured I'd treat
my best girl right.

325
00:26:05,998 --> 00:26:08,901
[coughs]

326
00:26:09,001 --> 00:26:11,871
Ah! Same shit you had last time.

327
00:26:11,971 --> 00:26:14,073
I got to introduce
you to my guy.

328
00:26:19,078 --> 00:26:20,579
Alright.

329
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:22,314
I'll be right out.

330
00:26:31,691 --> 00:26:33,559
What are you doing?
She's gonna see you in here.

331
00:26:33,660 --> 00:26:35,094
What the hell
you want me to do?

332
00:26:35,194 --> 00:26:36,595
this isn't exactly a film set
here.

333
00:26:36,696 --> 00:26:38,230
You can't be in here.

334
00:26:38,330 --> 00:26:39,899
Where am I supposed to go?

335
00:26:39,999 --> 00:26:42,334
There's no place else to film.
I gotta hide behind a stupid
curtain.

336
00:26:42,434 --> 00:26:43,569
Are you kidding me?

337
00:26:43,670 --> 00:26:45,271
How am I gonna make
a movie out of that?

338
00:26:45,371 --> 00:26:47,206
Trust me, I know what I'm
getting with this girl.

339
00:26:47,306 --> 00:26:50,409
You capture it on tape,
don't worry about what
the fuck I'm gonna do.

340
00:26:50,509 --> 00:26:52,144
I know how to
scare a prostitute.

341
00:26:52,244 --> 00:26:52,945
You get it on tape.

342
00:26:53,045 --> 00:26:56,182
Now, get in there,
on tape now. Now!

343
00:27:05,624 --> 00:27:07,727
What's wrong?

344
00:27:07,827 --> 00:27:10,496
Dick not work today?

345
00:27:10,596 --> 00:27:12,164
You are still dressed.

346
00:27:13,065 --> 00:27:14,300
Yea, I know.

347
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:17,970
Usually you're like
ready to cum the second
I walk in the door.

348
00:27:18,070 --> 00:27:21,774
I know, I just, today is
just a little different.

349
00:27:21,874 --> 00:27:23,175
You know. I just...

350
00:27:23,275 --> 00:27:26,846
You're gonna get
undressed or should
I just stand here?

351
00:27:26,946 --> 00:27:28,080
No I'm good, I'm good.

352
00:27:28,180 --> 00:27:32,318
I already got my money so
it's up to you sweetie.

353
00:27:32,418 --> 00:27:33,319

00:27:48,434 --> 00:27:50,202
Hold on.

357
00:27:51,971 --> 00:27:53,205

359
00:28:01,547 --> 00:28:03,049
Sorry about that dude.

360
00:28:03,149 --> 00:28:04,116
Sorry!

361
00:28:16,763 --> 00:28:17,997
Can I help you?

362
00:28:18,097 --> 00:28:19,131
You're loud.

363
00:28:19,231 --> 00:28:22,468
Oh I'm sorry man,

Hey turn it off! Turn off the
music. Turn it off!

380
00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:32,104
You are gonna fuckin' tape
me without telling me?
huh?

381
00:29:32,204 --> 00:29:33,906
Is that your game
mother fucker?

382
00:29:34,006 --> 00:29:36,608
You put this shit online so
you can make some money?

383
00:29:36,708 --> 00:29:41,413
Is that your plan? Yeah, slut
cam A. That's really fuckin'
cute.

384
00:29:41,513 --> 00:29:43,382
Really fuckin' cute!

385
00:29:45,784 --> 00:29:46,752
Fuck you!

Fuck you!

387
00:29:48,220 --> 00:29:50,422
I'm not a God damn
fucking porn star.

388
00:29:50,522 --> 00:29:52,524
I'm a professional
call girl.

389
00:29:52,624 --> 00:29:54,526
Don't ever call me again!

390
00:29:56,462 --> 00:30:02,501
and you know, if you
wanted to tape me, even
include him,

391
00:30:02,601 --> 00:30:04,036
all you had to do was ask.

392
00:30:10,442 --> 00:30:12,511
I'm not gonna talk
about this anymore.

393
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:19,151
Look, I know you are
good at running camera,
but we can't just run
around shooting stuff.

394
00:30:20,252 --> 00:30:22,922
I will take care
of tomorrow night.

395
00:30:26,392 --> 00:30:28,194
It's a little ghetto
around here, I know.

396
00:30:32,598 --> 00:30:33,765
Why are we
coming this way?

397
00:30:33,866 --> 00:30:37,336
Just. Listen,
just bear with me.

398
00:31:02,494 --> 00:31:04,696
You're taping this, right?

399
00:31:04,796 --> 00:31:06,298
Yeah.

400
00:31:22,982 --> 00:31:26,718
At least now you know why we
can't get somebody that we
already know.

401
00:31:26,818 --> 00:31:29,055
It's not going to work. I mean,

402
00:31:29,155 --> 00:31:33,425
I don't have a problem getting
a prostitute or something.
That's fine, but...

403
00:31:33,525 --> 00:31:35,394
At least that way, we
know we can scare her.

404
00:31:35,494 --> 00:31:37,496
That's why we're here.

405
00:31:39,231 --> 00:31:41,934
I thought we were
supposed to start
down on 17th street.

406
00:31:42,034 --> 00:31:44,937
No, this place
is much better.

407

Ah! Jesus!

408

Fuckin' relax!
We're locked in.

00:31:56,248 --> 00:31:59,085
What do you expect?
Look where we're at.

410
00:32:03,255 --> 00:32:05,057
Why are you turning down here,
man? Nobody's down here.

411
00:32:05,157 --> 00:32:06,858
Yeah, there are. Just
gotta know where to look.

412
00:32:06,959 --> 00:32:09,295
-What are you talking about?
-Just trust me.

413
00:32:09,395 --> 00:32:12,098
I do this enough,
more than I should.

414
00:32:15,001 --> 00:32:17,869
Ah, yes, yes, yes!
What did I say?

415
00:32:17,970 --> 00:32:21,007
Roll the window down.
Roll it down.

416
00:32:27,980 --> 00:32:30,482
Well, hey there cutie.

417
00:32:31,050 --> 00:32:33,385

418
00:32:33,485 --> 00:32:35,354
Nice.

00:32:36,255 --> 00:32:39,758
Hi. Can we...
can we have some sex?

420
00:32:39,858 --> 00:32:41,627
-Whoa!
-Dude, dude...

421
00:32:41,727 --> 00:32:43,295
Hold on there sweetheart.

422
00:32:43,395 --> 00:32:45,664
We're just out
looking for dates.

423
00:32:45,764 --> 00:32:48,667
It's dates. It's code word.
Not sex, dumbass.

424
00:32:48,767 --> 00:32:51,537
Which I never understood
why you call it dates. There's
no dating. No ones dating.

425
00:32:51,637 --> 00:32:54,740
We're fucking. That's all we're
doing. You know that.

426
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:58,744
I'm Lolita and this here's

427
00:32:58,844 --> 00:33:00,579
Shit. How old are you?

428
00:33:00,679 --> 00:33:01,713
I'm 18.

429
00:33:01,813 --> 00:33:03,782
Are you kidding me?

430
00:33:03,882 --> 00:33:05,417
Are you guys ok
being videotaped?

431
00:33:05,517 --> 00:33:07,686
Yeah, just extra
charge. Girl on girl.

432
00:33:07,786 --> 00:33:11,057
-Whatever, yeah
-Watch out.

433
00:33:15,894 --> 00:33:17,196
Do we have a problem
here, fellas?

434
00:33:17,296 --> 00:33:20,066
Ah, no we don't.
We're good. We're sorry.

435
00:33:20,166 --> 00:33:24,403
-We were just talking.
-You were just talking? Well
this shit ain't for free. You
understand me?

436
00:33:24,503 --> 00:33:26,772
You know what? My bad.
We're out here.

437
00:33:26,872 --> 00:33:29,375
-You do that.
-OK.

438
00:33:35,681 --> 00:33:37,649
-Go the other motherfucking way!
-I know. I know.

439
00:33:37,749 --> 00:33:40,018
Move this piece of shit!

440
00:33:41,420 --> 00:33:44,223
-What's the matter with you?
-Owww! Jamal, you're hurting me.

441
00:33:49,328 --> 00:33:51,130
Pick up the camera.

442
00:33:51,930 --> 00:33:53,499
Pick up the camera.

443
00:33:53,599 --> 00:33:54,800
What are you doing?

444
00:33:57,403 --> 00:33:59,405
What are you doing? Stop!

445
00:34:05,611 --> 00:34:06,712

00:34:26,932 --> 00:34:29,135
-Shut up!
-I'm sorry.

452
00:34:30,802 --> 00:34:34,273
-Ahh come on, come on, come on!
-That's what I thought.
-Chill!

453
00:34:35,474 --> 00:34:37,042

454
00:34:37,143 --> 00:34:38,377
Tanqueray!

455
00:34:38,477 --> 00:34:41,447
Punk ass, thinks he's tough.
Here, hold the gun.

00:34:50,656 --> 00:34:52,824
Fucking bitches!

00:34:54,025 --> 00:34:56,428
[dogs barking at a distance]

460
00:35:07,673 --> 00:35:09,775
Well, that didn't go
according to plan.

461
00:35:09,875 --> 00:35:11,743
Oh really. You think?

462
00:35:24,590 --> 00:35:26,592
We gotta get out of
this fucking neighborhood.

463
00:35:28,694 --> 00:35:30,429
Shit!

464
00:35:31,797 --> 00:35:34,032
Just calm down.

465
00:35:34,132 --> 00:35:35,667
We didn't do
anything wrong.

466
00:35:41,072 --> 00:35:42,541
You want to put
that under the seat.

467
00:35:54,386 --> 00:35:56,722
Don't say a word.
Let me talk to the guy.

468
00:36:04,896 --> 00:36:07,566
Would you roll your window
all the way down sir?

469
00:36:08,834 --> 00:36:10,902
Let's see your license
and registration, please?

470
00:36:14,072 --> 00:36:16,342
What is the nature
of your inquiry, Sir?

471
00:36:16,442 --> 00:36:17,976
License and
registration, please.

472
00:36:18,076 --> 00:36:20,712
Ah, no sir, we don't have to
show you license and
registration

473
00:36:20,812 --> 00:36:23,815
until you tell us
the nature of the inquiry.

474
00:36:23,915 --> 00:36:26,952
Sir, I'm speaking with
this gentleman right here.

475
00:36:27,052 --> 00:36:33,925
And I am very politely
speaking with you too
here, Officer, Underhill?

476
00:36:35,093 --> 00:36:37,363
Sir, put the
video camera down.

477
00:36:37,463 --> 00:36:39,898
It's actually my first
amendment constitutional
right, sir

478
00:36:39,998 --> 00:36:44,636
to video tape you and all
interactions with you as it
is a form of free expression.

479
00:36:44,736 --> 00:36:45,771
Sir...

480
00:36:45,871 --> 00:36:47,573
It's also CA state Civil
Code

481
00:36:47,673 --> 00:36:50,309
120477, which if you read your
manual,

482
00:36:50,409 --> 00:36:53,011
and I believe at some point, you
were required to do that,

483
00:36:53,111 --> 00:36:57,283
it is not required for a
citizen to show any form of
identification to any officer of
the law

484
00:36:57,383 --> 00:37:01,152
unless first given that nature
of the inquiry and since
you have yet to provide us

485
00:37:01,253 --> 00:37:05,591
with any significant
reason, you're acting
outside the Constitutional
fold of government.

486
00:37:05,691 --> 00:37:11,363
Therefore Officer
Underhill, we do politely
decline to show you our
license and registration.

487
00:37:11,463 --> 00:37:13,131
Sir.

488
00:37:13,231 --> 00:37:17,202
I pulled you
over because you're a
suspicious vehicle in a
known gang neighborhood.

489
00:37:17,303 --> 00:37:22,240
Are we suspicious because
we're two caucasian
males driving in a non-
caucasian neighborhood?

490
00:37:22,341 --> 00:37:23,609
No. Sir...

491
00:37:23,709 --> 00:37:25,143
You have still yet to
provide us

492
00:37:25,243 --> 00:37:28,714
with any reason
on the nature of inquiry
on why you have stopped us.

493
00:37:28,814 --> 00:37:32,017
But if we are in a known
gang neighborhood as you
say we are,

494
00:37:32,117 --> 00:37:35,387
then you may really wanna
rethink your next few moments.

495
00:37:35,487 --> 00:37:38,957
Because as we're sitting
in this truck all safe
and sound,

496
00:37:39,057 --> 00:37:43,228
here you are, an officer of the
law, standing out there
unprotected

497
00:37:43,329 --> 00:37:47,566
and there maybe someone around
here who just wants to take a
shot at you.

498
00:37:47,666 --> 00:37:50,736
So, it's your call
Officer Underhill.

499
00:37:58,510 --> 00:37:59,978
I want you two to
be on your way.

500
00:38:01,046 --> 00:38:02,814
Yes sir.

501
00:38:02,914 --> 00:38:04,483
Yes sir.

502
00:38:05,717 --> 00:38:07,553
Oh shit!

503
00:38:07,653 --> 00:38:09,755
Dude, that was awesome!

504
00:38:10,722 --> 00:38:12,391
How do you know all
of that California
State Code shit?

505
00:38:12,491 --> 00:38:14,125
I don't.
I just made it up.

506
00:38:14,225 --> 00:38:15,160
Yeah, right!

507
00:38:15,260 --> 00:38:17,663
Evidently, he doesn't
know it either.

508
00:38:43,822 --> 00:38:46,492
Hey, don't worry.
That cop can't do shit.

509
00:38:46,592 --> 00:38:48,126
He knows we have
him on film.

510
00:38:48,226 --> 00:38:50,195
We can post it online.

511
00:38:50,295 --> 00:38:52,864
You act like this
isn't even a big deal.

512
00:38:52,964 --> 00:38:54,533
This is the fun part.

513
00:38:54,633 --> 00:38:56,201
We have a cop, hookers...

514
00:38:56,301 --> 00:38:59,070
a pimp getting run
over by a truck, what
more do you want?

515
00:38:59,170 --> 00:39:00,772
I wanna direct!

516
00:39:00,872 --> 00:39:05,176
Just...
let me be the one
to pick out the girl.

517
00:39:05,276 --> 00:39:06,912
Let's do it!

518
00:39:09,114 --> 00:39:12,451
[rock music playing]

519
00:40:14,312 --> 00:40:17,148
Ooh, ooh, look
right there! Look, look.
Right there. Right there.
Right there!

520
00:40:27,526 --> 00:40:29,795
Du bist spaet.

521
00:40:31,830 --> 00:40:38,904
Wir ein...umm, uh..
wir habin ein problem gehabt.

522
00:40:39,004 --> 00:40:41,640
What? what is that?
What'd she say?

523
00:40:41,740 --> 00:40:45,544
I think...she asked
if we want dates?

524
00:40:45,644 --> 00:40:47,412
OK, yeah, yeah.
We want dates.

525
00:40:47,513 --> 00:40:49,881
OK, ask her, right now,
if she works alone...

526
00:40:49,981 --> 00:40:54,920
or if she has some crazy-assed
pimp holding her chain.
Ask her. Say it.

527
00:40:55,020 --> 00:41:02,160
I do work alone and
no, I don't have crazy
ass-pimp holding chain.

528
00:41:02,260 --> 00:41:03,128
"Ass-pimp."

529
00:41:03,228 --> 00:41:05,096
I like her. Umm...

530
00:41:05,196 --> 00:41:07,599
How much for a date with
him for tomorrow night?

531
00:41:07,699 --> 00:41:11,503
You mean how many roses
I like on first date?

532
00:41:11,603 --> 00:41:13,672
Stupid code word
for.. yeah, yeah.

533
00:41:13,772 --> 00:41:16,675
OK, 75 roses, ok,
tomorrow night?

534
00:41:16,775 --> 00:41:20,612
ohh...You waste my time!

535
00:41:21,312 --> 00:41:23,014
Hold on, ok,
Hold on.

536
00:41:23,114 --> 00:41:26,284
-Dude, she's...
-I know that.
I know. Stop. Hold on

537
00:41:26,384 --> 00:41:31,022
I know that. This is what I do.
Let me do my thing. I'll take
care of this.

538
00:41:32,057 --> 00:41:35,727
Hey. Hey!
Don't walk away.
Come here.

539
00:41:35,827 --> 00:41:37,529
Look, in America, this
is how we do things.

540
00:41:37,629 --> 00:41:41,066
I give you an offer,
you give one back. It's called
negotiating sweetheart.

541
00:41:41,166 --> 00:41:43,602
I don't play game.

542
00:41:43,702 --> 00:41:47,573
Two hundred roses.
I do anything you want.

543
00:41:47,673 --> 00:41:50,742
Two hundred
roses.

544
00:41:50,842 --> 00:41:54,646
-I'll do it.
-You sure?
-I'll cover it.

545
00:41:54,746 --> 00:41:57,248
Two hundred
"Roses" tomorrow.
Where do we meet you?

546
00:41:57,348 --> 00:42:00,018
Tomorrow night,
come here.

547
00:42:00,118 --> 00:42:01,987
Nine O'clock.

548
00:42:02,087 --> 00:42:04,055
Bring cash.

549
00:42:04,155 --> 00:42:06,057
We have a fun date.

550
00:42:06,157 --> 00:42:08,794
Oh yeah, oh yeah!

551
00:42:10,629 --> 00:42:12,230
Oh, I want to hit that.

552
00:42:17,869 --> 00:42:19,470
I didn't know
you speak German.

553
00:42:19,571 --> 00:42:21,640
A little.

554
00:43:19,364 --> 00:43:22,968
You can't be seen
because she's expecting
to be with me.

555
00:43:23,068 --> 00:43:25,436
Just let me...

556
00:43:25,536 --> 00:43:28,940
think about this and
figure it all out.

557
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:30,709
What the hell are you
so nervous for?

558
00:43:30,809 --> 00:43:32,177
She's a prostitute.

559
00:43:32,277 --> 00:43:34,345
She's going to like you
regardless. You paid for her.

560
00:43:34,445 --> 00:43:37,548
I just don't know
why I have to be
the one to do this.

561
00:43:37,649 --> 00:43:39,517
Because I'm the one
doing the scaring.

562
00:43:39,617 --> 00:43:42,587
Yeah! and we saw how well
that went last time.

563
00:43:42,688 --> 00:43:46,191
Right, you didn't scare her.
I sure as hell didn't scare her.
She punched me in the face.

564
00:43:48,660 --> 00:43:52,563
Every big horror movie
has got like a larger
than life bad guy.

565
00:43:52,664 --> 00:43:55,000
You got like Freddie,
Jason, Leatherface.

566
00:43:55,100 --> 00:43:58,103
You have these guys
that do the job.

567
00:43:58,203 --> 00:43:59,671
I think we gotta find
somebody like that.

568
00:43:59,771 --> 00:44:01,372
We gotta find some...

569
00:44:01,472 --> 00:44:06,411
some big, dark, scary something
to come out and do this.

570
00:44:06,511 --> 00:44:10,181
OK, where you going to find this
person now? We have 15 minutes
til you're meeting your girl.

571
00:44:10,281 --> 00:44:12,450
I don't know. There's all kinds
of shady people walking around
the warehouse.

572
00:44:12,550 --> 00:44:15,320
There's got to be
someone who can do it.

573
00:44:18,323 --> 00:44:19,991
I got it.

574
00:44:21,592 --> 00:44:24,329
I know just the guy.
I got it.

575
00:44:32,437 --> 00:44:34,139
You sure about this?

576
00:44:35,606 --> 00:44:40,311
Ah yeah. I'm the only one with
the keys so we should be OK.

577
00:44:41,512 --> 00:44:44,149
What's with the plastic?

578
00:44:44,249 --> 00:44:49,587
Oh! uh, they're going
to be painting in here,
so we should be alright.

579
00:44:49,687 --> 00:44:51,857
Alright.

580
00:44:51,957 --> 00:44:53,725
So, its $200 for an hour?

581
00:44:55,260 --> 00:44:56,261
Yeah.

582
00:44:57,195 --> 00:44:58,696
Good

583
00:45:01,232 --> 00:45:03,401
Ah, here.

584
00:45:06,671 --> 00:45:08,874
[music playing]

585
00:45:08,974 --> 00:45:10,475
Yeah.

586
00:45:24,655 --> 00:45:26,858
Is it OK
if I am filming you?

587
00:45:26,958 --> 00:45:29,494
It's your hour baby.

588
00:45:32,630 --> 00:45:35,033
Have you ever been
on camera before?

589
00:45:35,133 --> 00:45:36,935
No.

590
00:45:42,540 --> 00:45:44,509
We're good, right?
You know what you're doing?

591
00:45:47,145 --> 00:45:49,147
Hey! We're good,
right? Hey!

592
00:45:49,247 --> 00:45:50,715
Yeah.

593
00:45:50,816 --> 00:45:53,484
"Yeah" we're good
or "yeah" you don't know
what we're talking about?

594
00:45:53,584 --> 00:45:54,820
Yeah.

595
00:45:56,855 --> 00:46:00,191
Look, let's try this.
Look at me, I look at you.
We communicate...hey, Hi!

596
00:46:00,291 --> 00:46:03,094
We look at each other.
We communicate. That's
what goes on here.

597
00:46:58,917 --> 00:47:00,852
Take this.

598
00:47:03,588 --> 00:47:05,490
I want you to
walk in there.

599
00:47:05,590 --> 00:47:09,094
You're gonna waive it around.
You're gonna scare the shit out
of her, right?

600
00:47:09,194 --> 00:47:12,663
-Like in the movies?
-Shhh!...What? What? What?

601
00:47:12,763 --> 00:47:15,733
Are you hearing
anything I'm saying?
What did we agree on?

602
00:47:15,833 --> 00:47:17,768
I'm gonna give you
one hundred dollars cash.

603
00:47:17,869 --> 00:47:21,706
You're gonna be a big movie star
after this. Is that good?
Is that getting through?

604
00:47:21,806 --> 00:47:24,409
OK, now look. I can't go in
there. I can't get in the shot.

605
00:47:24,509 --> 00:47:27,112
But I'm going to watch right
here on that monitor.

606
00:47:28,279 --> 00:47:31,082
It's...
Look scary, whatever.

607
00:47:31,182 --> 00:47:33,584
You smell like shit!
Seriously.

608
00:47:33,684 --> 00:47:35,520
Are you ready?

609
00:47:35,620 --> 00:47:37,855

Excuse me sir,
can I help you?

616
00:50:19,917 --> 00:50:21,319
Uh, no.

617
00:50:21,419 --> 00:50:23,388
I work here.

618
00:50:23,488 --> 00:50:26,957
I don't have anyone
scheduled here
for tonight.
What's your name?

619

Lane... Lane Hayes.
I work for Richard.

620

We're all done.
I'm just waiting
for my buddy to lock up.

We ran a little
behind, um, tonight...
Just...

622
00:50:39,204 --> 00:50:42,407
Sir, it's 4:30 in the morning.
If you guys are going to be in
after hours

623
00:50:42,507 --> 00:50:44,642
you need to fill out
a security work order

624
00:50:44,742 --> 00:50:49,414
so we know you're here.
We don't want someone
accidentally getting shot.

625
00:50:49,514 --> 00:50:50,748
Yes sir.

626
00:50:54,385 --> 00:50:55,953
We're all cleaned up.
Let's go.

627

Working late tonight?

OK gentlemen, have
a nice evening.

632
00:51:14,205 --> 00:51:15,840
OK, let's get out of here.
Go.

You want a hand with that?

00:51:52,677 --> 00:51:54,379
No.

635
00:51:54,479 --> 00:51:55,613
I got it.

636
00:52:26,511 --> 00:52:30,014
When the tide rolls
in, it should take
the body out with it.

637
00:52:30,114 --> 00:52:31,649
We'll be alright.

638
00:52:31,749 --> 00:52:33,284
If you think so.

639
00:53:04,915 --> 00:53:06,784
This looks so real.

640
00:53:11,088 --> 00:53:13,424
That's because
it was real.

641
00:53:18,429 --> 00:53:20,798
What do you
want to do now?

642
00:53:25,903 --> 00:53:27,405
I don't know.

643
00:53:28,573 --> 00:53:30,475
I don't know, I mean...

I mean, we didn't do anything.

645
00:53:37,615 --> 00:53:39,116
Right?

646
00:53:39,216 --> 00:53:42,086
I mean we didn't do anything.
It was the guy. The guy came in
there...

647
00:53:42,186 --> 00:53:46,624
The guy came in there, with a
knife and slit her throat.

648
00:53:46,724 --> 00:53:50,528
He came there man,
and slit her throat,
gosh, just...

649
00:53:50,628 --> 00:53:53,030
God! why did you tell
him to come in there
and slit her throat?

650
00:53:53,130 --> 00:53:54,532
I didn't tell him
to do anything!

651
00:53:54,632 --> 00:53:57,001
I told him wave the knife
around and scare her.
That's what I said.

652
00:53:57,101 --> 00:53:59,136
Yeah, he did.

653
00:53:59,236 --> 00:54:01,339
He scared her...

654
00:54:01,439 --> 00:54:03,408
and he killed her.

655
00:54:18,088 --> 00:54:21,258
We didn't do anything.

656
00:54:21,359 --> 00:54:22,560
We're ok.

657
00:54:22,660 --> 00:54:24,695
We're ok.

658
00:54:27,598 --> 00:54:29,734
We gotta call
the cops on this.

659
00:54:29,834 --> 00:54:31,402
Ok, calm down.

660
00:54:31,502 --> 00:54:33,237
Think this thing through.

661
00:54:33,338 --> 00:54:37,074
I am thinking it through.

662
00:54:37,174 --> 00:54:38,643
What are you going
to tell the cops?

663
00:54:38,743 --> 00:54:41,278
We paid some deranged
homeless man...

664
00:54:41,379 --> 00:54:43,681
to put a knife up to the neck
of some prostitute,

665
00:54:43,781 --> 00:54:46,551
and then tape it for fun, and
then he slices her throat
and then you...

666
00:54:46,651 --> 00:54:49,754
wanna drop the body off
into the ocean?

667
00:54:53,858 --> 00:54:55,626
We dumped her body, ok?

668
00:54:55,726 --> 00:54:57,127
We are accomplices
to murder.

669
00:54:57,227 --> 00:54:58,396
I'm on probation.

670
00:54:58,496 --> 00:55:00,197
If I even sneeze in the
wrong direction...

671
00:55:00,297 --> 00:55:01,899
I go to jail for a long time.

672
00:55:01,999 --> 00:55:03,934
That's not gonna happen.

673
00:55:04,034 --> 00:55:05,269
We covered our tracks.

674
00:55:05,370 --> 00:55:06,371
We're fine!

675
00:55:06,471 --> 00:55:08,806
We're not gonna
to get caught.

676
00:55:11,842 --> 00:55:14,812
Tell me you didn't feel that
rush? That adrenaline!

677
00:55:14,912 --> 00:55:18,716
A dead body in the back
of a truck with a security
guard right there

678
00:55:18,816 --> 00:55:23,688
and then us driving all over
town knowing that any second we
can get caught, but we didn't.

679
00:55:23,788 --> 00:55:26,056
That's a fucking
rush and you know it!

680
00:55:26,156 --> 00:55:30,260
No drug can fix that, no
high, no pill, no needle
can ever top that!

681
00:55:30,361 --> 00:55:32,730
I know you
fucking felt that!

682
00:55:35,500 --> 00:55:37,134
It's a prostitute.

683
00:55:37,234 --> 00:55:38,703
She's a bad person.

684
00:55:38,803 --> 00:55:41,205
Nobody's gonna miss
a bad person.

685
00:55:41,305 --> 00:55:44,041
a diseased-filled hooker.

686
00:55:44,141 --> 00:55:46,477
She's already dead
in the inside.

687
00:55:46,577 --> 00:55:49,914
Hell, we did her a favor,
she'd probably thank us.

688
00:55:56,286 --> 00:55:59,857
So, where do we
go from here?

689
00:55:59,957 --> 00:56:01,626
We're in this now.

690
00:56:01,726 --> 00:56:04,028
I say we finish the game.

691
00:56:06,397 --> 00:56:08,999
Your directorial
debut has to be big.

692
00:56:09,099 --> 00:56:10,735
We have big.

693
00:56:10,835 --> 00:56:15,573
I'm going to say it
again: Finish the game.

694
00:56:29,186 --> 00:56:31,656
[phone rings]

695
00:56:34,224 --> 00:56:38,729
-"Five Star Releasing"
-Adam Phillips please.
- Just a moment.

696
00:56:44,502 --> 00:56:49,006
-This is Adam
-Hey Adam, this Travis Simon.
I work with Richard over
at the film warehouse.

697
00:56:49,106 --> 00:56:51,742
Hey, Hey Travis how
you ding he mentioned
you'd be calling. How are ya?

698
00:56:51,842 --> 00:56:55,412
I'm doing well, ahh
I'm actually directing
a film right now...

699
00:56:55,513 --> 00:56:58,849
and Richard thought it might be
a good idea if I get a hold of
you and...

700
00:56:58,949 --> 00:57:00,851
maybe talk about some
distribution when we're all
done.

701
00:57:00,951 --> 00:57:03,821
No, absolutely, why don't you
tell me a little about the film.

702
00:57:21,005 --> 00:57:22,873
Where's my plastic?

703
00:57:24,542 --> 00:57:26,711
Who took my plastic down?

704
00:57:26,811 --> 00:57:29,680
Todd, did you take
my plastic down?

705
00:57:29,780 --> 00:57:31,516
I didn't touch
your shit man.

706
00:57:31,616 --> 00:57:33,017
What's the matter
with you, bro?

707
00:57:33,117 --> 00:57:34,284
Mike? Did you take it down?

708
00:57:34,384 --> 00:57:35,520
I didn't take your shit man.

709
00:57:35,620 --> 00:57:37,121
It was down when I got here this
morning.

710
00:57:37,221 --> 00:57:38,288
Chill man!

711
00:57:38,388 --> 00:57:41,391
It wasn't the fuckin
tooth-fairy was it?

712
00:57:41,492 --> 00:57:45,730
Travis had me come in
here yesterday, clear
all this crap out of
here, and hang plastic.

713
00:57:45,830 --> 00:57:47,665
It took me a hour and
forty five minutes.

714
00:57:47,765 --> 00:57:49,900
We're supposed to be
painting in there today.

715
00:57:51,035 --> 00:57:54,905
Dude go, go get it,
hang it back up then.

716
00:57:57,808 --> 00:58:00,410
-Lane?
-Huh?
-Did you take my plastic down?

717
00:58:00,511 --> 00:58:03,013
No, need some help
putting some up?

718
00:58:03,113 --> 00:58:04,515
I guess.

719
00:58:04,615 --> 00:58:06,717
Ahh, whatever.

720
00:58:09,286 --> 00:58:10,721
Ok that sounds
really good.

721
00:58:10,821 --> 00:58:12,222
Well, I'll tell you
what...

722
00:58:12,322 --> 00:58:14,491
when you are near
completion, why don't you give
me a call?

723
00:58:14,592 --> 00:58:17,862
I'll have you come on in.
We'll sit down, we'll talk and
we'll take it from there

724
00:58:17,962 --> 00:58:20,030
-Yeah that sounds good,
-Thank you.

725
00:58:20,130 --> 00:58:22,700
You got it, I look
forward to meeting you.

726
00:58:22,800 --> 00:58:25,670
You as well, ok bye.

727
00:58:47,124 --> 00:58:49,894
Nobody wants to work
around here anymore!

728
00:58:52,730 --> 00:58:55,800
Richard selling the business.
Nobody cares anymore.

729
00:58:55,900 --> 00:58:57,167
I get it.

730
00:58:57,267 --> 00:58:58,969
It's Stupid.

731
00:59:04,609 --> 00:59:07,578
You know what? I also
wanna tell you, that...

732
00:59:07,678 --> 00:59:11,048
if I've been a dick,
I just want to say I'm sorry.
because you know,

733
00:59:11,148 --> 00:59:12,549
I'm just stressed out.

734
00:59:12,650 --> 00:59:15,786
I don't, I don't know
what I'm going to do.
I don't have a job lined up.

735
00:59:15,886 --> 00:59:18,022
I'm not sitting around
waiting to lose my job.

736
00:59:18,122 --> 00:59:19,256
I have shit lined up.

737
00:59:19,356 --> 00:59:20,891
Like what?

738
00:59:20,991 --> 00:59:22,893
Travis and I,
shooting a movie.

739
00:59:25,129 --> 00:59:28,666
What's so funny? Why wouldn't
we? Everything we need is right
here.

740
00:59:28,766 --> 00:59:31,335
Coming in late at
night, shooting scenes.

741
00:59:31,435 --> 00:59:33,203
-Seriously?
-Yeah.

742
00:59:33,303 --> 00:59:34,171
What's it about?

743
00:59:34,271 --> 00:59:35,706
It's a horror thriller...

744
00:59:35,806 --> 00:59:38,909
Travis wrote it.
It's actually bad ass.

745
00:59:39,009 --> 00:59:42,680
Sucks though, our lead
actor bailed out last
minute, so we have
to find another actor.

746
00:59:42,780 --> 00:59:45,783
Well, you know I'm
an actor, right?

747
00:59:45,883 --> 00:59:48,619
Yeah, ok bro.
You and everybody else in LA.

748
00:59:48,719 --> 00:59:50,054
No, I'm a real actor.

749
00:59:50,154 --> 00:59:51,956
I've taken classes
and everything.

750
00:59:52,056 --> 00:59:55,125
I did a movie like three
years ago with the Beav.

751
00:59:55,225 --> 00:59:58,195
-With Jerry Mathers?
-Yeah!
-Are you serious?
-Yeah.

752
00:59:58,295 --> 01:00:01,131
-Was he cool?
-Yeah, he was awesome.
-You got to meet him?

753
01:00:01,231 --> 01:00:02,867
Yeah! I did a scene
with him and everything.

754
01:00:02,967 --> 01:00:03,968
Nice!

755
01:00:04,068 --> 01:00:06,003
That's why, that's
why I got a job here.

756
01:00:06,103 --> 01:00:09,606
'cause I thought, you
know, meet some people
in the business.

757
01:00:09,707 --> 01:00:10,841
You any good?

758
01:00:10,941 --> 01:00:12,609
Yeah.

759
01:00:12,710 --> 01:00:14,979
I mean I can do the
full range of emotions.

760
01:00:15,079 --> 01:00:16,480
I'll do it.

761
01:00:16,580 --> 01:00:20,150
I mean I'll, I'll
even work for free.

762
01:00:20,250 --> 01:00:23,387
I don't know. It's a serious,
it's a death scene.

763
01:00:29,393 --> 01:00:30,795
Ok, look.

764
01:00:30,895 --> 01:00:32,663
Why don't you
come in tonight?

765
01:00:32,763 --> 01:00:34,865
We'll put you on camera
and see how it looks.

766
01:00:34,965 --> 01:00:37,167
And I'll show it to Travis
and see what he thinks.

767
01:00:37,267 --> 01:00:38,135
Ok.

768
01:00:38,235 --> 01:00:39,904
Ok...Alright.

769
01:00:40,004 --> 01:00:43,974
So, I'll meet you,
I'm gonna home and change now,
and I'll meet you here later.

770
01:00:44,074 --> 01:00:45,943
Ok, whatever.

771
01:00:57,621 --> 01:01:01,391
Are you fuckin kidding me?

772
01:01:01,491 --> 01:01:03,127
Who the fuck are you bro!

773
01:01:03,227 --> 01:01:05,329
-What the fuck is that?
-Stop! Just listen.
-Hold on Hold on!

774
01:01:05,429 --> 01:01:08,398
-I don't care. I don't make
enough for this!
-You know I'm trying to...

775
01:01:08,498 --> 01:01:14,104
I don't make enough for this!
I don't make enough for this,
you peeping-tom, dick-touching,
mother- fucker!

776
01:01:32,923 --> 01:01:36,326
So, uh, you need
help with anything?

777
01:01:37,694 --> 01:01:40,164
No, you're the talent. You just
need to worry about the acting.

778
01:01:40,264 --> 01:01:41,999
OK.

779
01:01:43,667 --> 01:01:45,770
I like your setup.

780
01:01:45,870 --> 01:01:47,671
You got enough light in here?

781
01:01:47,772 --> 01:01:49,206
Ah...yeah.

782
01:01:51,976 --> 01:01:55,913
So, how do we do this?
Do you have a script?

783
01:01:56,013 --> 01:02:00,384
Yeah, I just figured we go ahead
and, you know, improv this and
see how that goes if that's ok?

784
01:02:00,484 --> 01:02:01,919
Yeah sure.

785
01:02:02,019 --> 01:02:04,254
Do you want me to slate?

786
01:02:04,354 --> 01:02:05,923
Say my name and profiles?

787
01:02:06,023 --> 01:02:07,424
Oh yeah, slate, yeah.

788
01:02:07,524 --> 01:02:08,358
Ok.

789
01:02:08,458 --> 01:02:11,161
Hi. I'm Jake Anderson.

790
01:02:11,261 --> 01:02:12,429
I'm auditioning...

791
01:02:12,529 --> 01:02:13,998
ah, I don't
have an agent...

792
01:02:14,098 --> 01:02:17,835
ah, I'm auditioning for,
what, what's the movie name?

793
01:02:19,236 --> 01:02:23,073
-Ah, Cut.
-Ok, I'm auditioning for "Cut!"

794
01:02:30,714 --> 01:02:36,720
In this scene, ah, your
character's actually tied
up so, I mean, if you want...

795
01:02:36,821 --> 01:02:38,388
...to add to the realism,
to be tied up.

796
01:02:38,488 --> 01:02:41,458
-Yeah, ok. Sure.
-Ok.

797
01:02:44,094 --> 01:02:47,264
-Why don't we, just use these?
-Ok.

798
01:02:51,836 --> 01:02:53,337
You want me to
tie my feet?

799
01:02:53,437 --> 01:02:54,939
Yeah.

800
01:03:11,488 --> 01:03:14,391
I think I'm gonna need
help with, uh, this one.

801
01:03:20,697 --> 01:03:25,002
-Oh!, that's kinda tight.
-Yeah. Be right back.
-OK

802
01:03:33,443 --> 01:03:36,080
Yes, I'm bringing talent
to makeup right now.

803
01:03:36,180 --> 01:03:38,315
And tell them to bring me
a quesadilla. I haven't eaten
yet.

804
01:03:38,415 --> 01:03:40,484
-Watch it! What the hell
is your problem?
-Sorry bro.

805
01:03:40,584 --> 01:03:44,354
Hey. Um, production wants to
know what happened to the other
1k light.

806
01:03:44,454 --> 01:03:46,523
I don't know I thought
we got everything.
I'll check the truck.

807
01:03:46,623 --> 01:03:50,494
[Text message]
"Where the hell are you?"
We only got four.

808
01:04:00,971 --> 01:04:02,306
What's going on?

809
01:04:02,406 --> 01:04:03,807
This is the killer.

810
01:04:03,908 --> 01:04:05,375
Looks pretty good, right?

811
01:04:08,245 --> 01:04:09,579
Who is that?

812
01:04:11,882 --> 01:04:13,817
-Wait a second, that's that
homeless guy from out back!
-Yeah

813
01:04:13,918 --> 01:04:16,586
It's a low budget film.
We have to get actors
that work for cheap.

814
01:04:16,686 --> 01:04:21,291
-What's he gonna do!?
-He's gonna come at you,

815

Go!

-Wait a second
-Get Him!
-Wait a second! I don't like
this!

817
01:04:26,663 --> 01:04:28,198
Wait! Hey! Hey!

818
01:04:28,298 --> 01:04:30,334
Get in there right now!
You fucking slice his fucking
throat!

819
01:04:30,434 --> 01:04:31,735
You're a movie star.

820
01:04:31,835 --> 01:04:34,204
Aren't we supposed to go over
this? Go over like safety stuff?

821
01:04:34,304 --> 01:04:35,505
You son-of-a-bitch!
I fucking paid you!

822
01:04:35,605 --> 01:04:38,842
I don't fucking like this!
I don't fucking like this!

823
01:04:38,943 --> 01:04:41,611
Let me the fuck outa here!
Let me out of this!

825

Hey! Let me the fuck outta here,
motherfucker!

826
01:04:46,750 --> 01:04:48,185
Let me outta the chair!

827
01:04:50,687 --> 01:04:53,723
Oh, ohh...oh

828
01:04:53,823 --> 01:04:55,892
[panting]

829
01:04:56,360 --> 01:04:57,995
You stabbed me!

830
01:05:03,633 --> 01:05:07,271
Oh...shit
Oh shit...

831
01:05:09,940 --> 01:05:11,441
Oh, shit!

832
01:05:12,576 --> 01:05:14,378
Let me out!

833
01:05:14,478 --> 01:05:16,913
Let me out!

834
01:05:19,049 --> 01:05:21,185
We're making a movie.

835
01:05:27,457 --> 01:05:28,959
Oh, stop!

836
01:05:29,994 --> 01:05:31,661
Augh!

837
01:05:32,396 --> 01:05:33,597
Augh!!

838
01:05:34,731 --> 01:05:36,433
Augh!!!

839
01:05:38,969 --> 01:05:40,637
Aaugh, augh, aaugh...

840
01:05:50,547 --> 01:05:52,249
That's it.

841
01:05:52,349 --> 01:05:54,551
[laughing]

842
01:05:54,651 --> 01:05:56,686
We're making a movie!

843
01:06:57,214 --> 01:07:01,218
Hey, hey, hey! Want a treat?
Want a treat? Ready?

844
01:07:01,318 --> 01:07:03,653
Ooh, where is it?
It's right here.

845
01:07:03,753 --> 01:07:07,324
You want a treat? Come on, come
on, come on Jack!

846
01:07:07,424 --> 01:07:10,594
[News on TV]
And now we have an update
on the disturbing news
in North Hollywood

847
01:07:10,694 --> 01:07:14,898
where earlier today, a body
was found dumped inside
a large trash bin
of a local business

848
01:07:14,998 --> 01:07:18,068
Police and crime scene
investigators have been
on the scene all morning

849
01:07:18,168 --> 01:07:19,769
trying to make sense of
everything everything.

850
01:07:19,869 --> 01:07:24,141
We now go live
on the scene to Christina
Calderon with the latest.

851
01:07:24,241 --> 01:07:30,214
we are here live only a
few hours after a local
drifter discovered
a decapitated man's body

852
01:07:30,314 --> 01:07:36,720
inside a large dumpster.
Earlier today, I spoke with the
man who only wanted to be
referred to as Terry.

853
01:07:36,820 --> 01:07:43,760
I was cleaning up
the city getting cans and
bottles and get a little
bit a food, place to stay.

854
01:07:43,860 --> 01:07:49,766
I went to that can over
there, opened it up and
I just...

855
01:07:49,866 --> 01:07:53,537
There was this
person in there with his head
chopped off! It scared me man!
I gotta get outta here.

856
01:07:53,637 --> 01:07:58,007
And Tracy, the most
disturbing part is that
the body was found several
blocks away

857
01:07:58,108 --> 01:08:03,547
from Saint Paul's Elementary
School, which has many parents
very nervous.

858
01:08:03,647 --> 01:08:07,417
I think everyone
that I've spoken to
were just shocked.

859
01:08:07,517 --> 01:08:09,886
You just don't
expect this to happen
in your community.

860
01:08:09,986 --> 01:08:13,123
I mean, I know there are
people out there that are
sick and they're crazy,

861
01:08:13,223 --> 01:08:15,359
You don't expect them to be
right here.

862
01:08:15,459 --> 01:08:19,896
I was walking
past this area this
morning when I took
my daughter to school.

863
01:08:19,996 --> 01:08:22,432
It's just shocking.

864
01:08:22,532 --> 01:08:26,170
At the moment police
have locked down the
scene and are still
looking for clues .

865
01:08:26,270 --> 01:08:31,275
Residents, especially
those with small
children, are advised
to stay home after dark.

866
01:08:31,375 --> 01:08:33,743
Back to you in the studio.

867
01:08:36,746 --> 01:08:42,586
[On TV] Well folks, we do have
pretty severe weather moving in
as you can see here on our
radar.

868
01:08:42,686 --> 01:08:46,623
Lots of heavy patches of
rain moving into the L.A. basin.

869
01:08:46,723 --> 01:08:49,693
Some areas are gonna
see 2-3 inches of rain.

870
01:08:49,793 --> 01:08:56,466
Mountains ah, looking at snow at
the very high elevations and

871
01:08:56,566 --> 01:08:58,468
it's time to get out your
galoshes.

872
01:08:58,568 --> 01:09:02,939
Ah, This's probably going to
last the next 18 to 24 hours

873
01:09:03,039 --> 01:09:07,611
and then start
clearing up and we can get back
into our bathing suites.

874
01:09:07,711 --> 01:09:09,313
Back to you Tracy.

875
01:09:31,201 --> 01:09:33,403
Never been here before.

876
01:09:41,177 --> 01:09:45,349
Jamal would kill me
if he knew I was here
with you right now.

877
01:09:45,949 --> 01:09:47,584
He's not gonna find out.

878
01:09:54,424 --> 01:09:56,693
I can't believe you hit
him with that truck!

879
01:10:52,248 --> 01:10:56,720
[whimpering]

880
01:11:34,791 --> 01:11:37,594

881
01:12:31,448 --> 01:12:33,617
No sugar, right?

882
01:12:36,185 --> 01:12:38,422
What's the
matter with you?

883
01:14:35,905 --> 01:14:37,674
Those flickering lights
were insane really.

884
01:14:37,774 --> 01:14:39,776
I know they were
so bad on my eyes.

885
01:14:41,344 --> 01:14:43,780

[singing country music]

887
01:15:48,878 --> 01:15:52,481
[On the TV]
We're having some pretty strong
storm activity over greater
Los Angeles

888
01:15:52,582 --> 01:15:54,517
We're gonna have
thunder and lighting.

889
01:15:54,618 --> 01:15:56,586
Some possible showers here and
there...

890
01:15:56,686 --> 01:16:02,091
and it's gonna make
for some very interesting
weather and sometimes

891
01:16:02,191 --> 01:16:04,861
dangerous in certain areas.
So be careful out there.

892
01:16:04,961 --> 01:16:06,295
That's the weather
back to you Tracey.

893
01:16:08,564 --> 01:16:12,135
[On the TV]
Two headless female bodies were
found early this morning and
police are now saying

894
01:16:12,235 --> 01:16:15,104
this could be the work of a
possible serial killer.

895
01:16:15,204 --> 01:16:22,011
There is however
speculation that today's
findings could be the result
of a possible copy-cat.

896
01:16:22,111 --> 01:16:27,583
Police are urging anyone
with information to
contact the crime report
hot-line right away.

are you doing, man?

got her in the film.

What are you saying? I can't
hear what your saying right now.
What is that?

904

classy and professional,
is that what

fuck your saying!

01:16:56,379 --> 01:17:00,416
-Go To Hell!
-Fuck yeah! I'll be first in
line you fucking bitch!

907
01:17:00,516 --> 01:17:03,586
You wanted a legitimate
actress for this film to make it
work. That's what I got.

need to be here right now.
You nned to do this right now.

911
01:17:11,861 --> 01:17:15,431
Do a cameo. Get in here right
now. Stephen King does it,
so why don't you do it?

to do this. I'll do your movie!
I'll do whatever you want!

that! Do it again, right in my
mouth.

No, I agree, between the tripod
cam and the ones we got in the
ceiling,

931
01:25:09,138 --> 01:25:11,274
I really think we've got
everything covered....

932
01:25:12,808 --> 01:25:14,977
Yeah, no, the meeting with the
film office guy went really
well.

933
01:25:15,077 --> 01:25:16,512
In fact, he wants to meet again
next week.

934
01:25:16,612 --> 01:25:19,682
Hopefully, we can go
ahead and finalize.

935
01:25:19,782 --> 01:25:22,185
Yeah, I just picked
up the footage so that
I can finish the edit.

936
01:25:22,285 --> 01:25:24,253
I'm just worried about
the ending though.

937
01:25:25,754 --> 01:25:28,591
No, I'm gonna meet her as soon
as I leave here tonight.

[loud slam]

939
01:25:35,698 --> 01:25:38,267
I don't know.
Let me call you back.

940
01:25:40,035 --> 01:25:42,305
Yeah, that's a good idea.

941
01:26:01,624 --> 01:26:04,193
You're going to close
the deal without me?

942
01:26:04,293 --> 01:26:06,662
Is that your plan?

943
01:26:09,064 --> 01:26:10,899
How you doing Lane?

944
01:26:13,469 --> 01:26:17,072
You know, the first
time you kill someone,
it may not be as...

945
01:26:17,172 --> 01:26:19,475
easy as you think to get over.

946
01:26:20,843 --> 01:26:22,578
I still have
dreams about it.

947
01:26:26,582 --> 01:26:30,018
You know, you do it
a couple more times, it
becomes a little easier.

948
01:26:30,118 --> 01:26:32,621
That is true,
what they say.

949
01:26:38,060 --> 01:26:39,462
Sit down.

950
01:26:42,731 --> 01:26:44,700
Sit down, Travis.

951
01:27:10,459 --> 01:27:12,961
You think you're a
pretty smart guy, huh?

952
01:27:15,264 --> 01:27:17,600
You know, in the
beginning...

953
01:27:17,700 --> 01:27:20,235
we talked about
making a movie.

954
01:27:20,336 --> 01:27:21,770
You know, scaring people.

955
01:27:21,870 --> 01:27:24,907
Making it look real.

956
01:27:25,007 --> 01:27:26,809
Things changed a
little bit, huh?

957
01:27:28,877 --> 01:27:31,013
You know, in the end,
it kind of became real.

958
01:27:33,682 --> 01:27:34,883
Yeah...

959
01:27:43,359 --> 01:27:46,729
Then it became real
convenient for you.

960
01:27:46,829 --> 01:27:48,163
Now I'm the one
taking the chances.

961
01:27:48,263 --> 01:27:50,699
I'm the one making
shit happen.

962
01:27:50,799 --> 01:27:54,870
Oh, and I love your whole...
surveillance camera thing.

963
01:27:54,970 --> 01:27:56,972
That was genius.

964
01:27:58,541 --> 01:28:00,543
You didn't think
I saw that, huh?

965
01:28:02,611 --> 01:28:05,848
So, what? Are you just
gonna shoot me?

966
01:28:05,948 --> 01:28:07,616
What? Cheat the audience?

967
01:28:07,716 --> 01:28:09,352
No way.

968
01:28:14,690 --> 01:28:17,059
So where do we
go from here?

969
01:28:30,506 --> 01:28:32,174
You wanna burn me?

970
01:28:32,274 --> 01:28:34,209
You think you can burn me?

971
01:28:34,309 --> 01:28:36,779
Now, it's your
turn to burn.

972
01:28:38,180 --> 01:28:41,384

Come on man, that's
the best you got?

975
01:29:10,979 --> 01:29:14,182
Come on Lane, the
cameras are rolling, man!

976
01:29:14,282 --> 01:29:17,352
Oh, I've got a lot
more than that, as
you've already seen.

977
01:29:18,521 --> 01:29:20,823
Yeah, that's right.
I've seen it.

978
01:29:22,357 --> 01:29:24,460
I couldn't have done
this without you.

979
01:29:26,161 --> 01:29:27,963
You are my star.

980
01:29:29,131 --> 01:29:30,799
What the hell you
talking about?

981
01:29:30,899 --> 01:29:35,270
Come on Lane, you, you
really think it's a
coincidence, huh?

982
01:29:35,370 --> 01:29:43,011
That you, an ex-con with a
prison record and a history
of violence towards women

983
01:29:43,111 --> 01:29:45,814
would actually get hired here?

984
01:29:47,015 --> 01:29:49,418
Or that you just happen
to meet these...

985
01:29:49,518 --> 01:29:52,688
random people who could solve
all of your problems.

986
01:29:52,788 --> 01:29:56,525
-Are you kidding me?
-Spare change for food?
-No! eat that!"

987
01:29:57,560 --> 01:30:00,796
Harry Hawke. And this is my
assistant Chloe Jo.

988
01:30:00,896 --> 01:30:04,767
She just finished making a film
in Germany.

989
01:30:04,867 --> 01:30:07,903
Did you pick up any German
while you were there?

990
01:30:08,003 --> 01:30:09,905
Du bist spaet.

991
01:30:10,005 --> 01:30:12,007
Wir habin ein problem

992
01:30:12,107 --> 01:30:14,877
-I saw you looking at Gabby.
You like her, don't you?
-I like brunettes.

993
01:30:14,977 --> 01:30:17,079
I think she asked
if we want dates?

994
01:30:17,179 --> 01:30:19,782
OK, yeah, yeah. We want dates.

995
01:30:21,550 --> 01:30:22,751
You set me up.

996
01:30:22,851 --> 01:30:25,588
Yeah!
I couldn't afford actors.

997
01:30:25,688 --> 01:30:31,093
I couldn't afford some
elaborate production, but
I didn't have to because
you did that for me.

998
01:30:31,426 --> 01:30:34,497
You were my prostitute.

999
01:30:34,597 --> 01:30:37,432
You were my bitch.

1000
01:30:37,533 --> 01:30:40,002
And I didn't have
to pay you a dime.

1001
01:30:41,570 --> 01:30:43,772
And I didn't have
to pay you a dime!

1002
01:30:44,873 --> 01:30:45,941
No.

1003
01:30:46,041 --> 01:30:49,211
bull shit! I saw her die?
Fuck you, man!

1004
01:30:49,311 --> 01:30:52,114
No. No, you didn't.

1005
01:30:52,214 --> 01:30:53,415
You saw what I
wanted you to see.

1006
01:30:53,516 --> 01:30:57,786
,You saw exactly what
I placed in front of
you, for you to think.

1007
01:31:05,060 --> 01:31:06,094
Camera off!

1008
01:31:06,194 --> 01:31:07,329
You alright?

1009
01:31:07,429 --> 01:31:08,897
Yeah.

1010
01:31:11,734 --> 01:31:12,768
Go!

1011
01:31:17,540 --> 01:31:19,407
Is this my first
time on camera?

1012
01:31:19,508 --> 01:31:23,712
-I think we both know the answer
to that one!
-Yea, I love you.

1013
01:31:25,347 --> 01:31:26,915
Let's get the scarf off.

1014
01:31:33,856 --> 01:31:35,090
Go!

1015
01:31:46,769 --> 01:31:51,574
That's what it does man!
What the eyes see and the ears
hear, the mind believes!

1016
01:31:51,674 --> 01:31:53,809
You want a hand with that?

1017
01:31:53,909 --> 01:31:55,711
I got it

1018
01:31:56,812 --> 01:31:59,481
You gave me everything I need
to get this film sold

1019
01:31:59,582 --> 01:32:04,119
and make me the best first time
director ever. I mean,
think of everything we got!

1020
01:32:06,221 --> 01:32:08,557
We just need the conclusion.
You're right. We're not gonna
cheat the audience.

1021
01:32:08,657 --> 01:32:09,992
You just take that knife.

1022
01:32:10,092 --> 01:32:12,227
You take that knife
right now, and just
stab me in the heart.

1023
01:32:12,327 --> 01:32:14,362
Think about it! We've got the
greatest ending ever right now.

1024
01:32:14,462 --> 01:32:18,967
We've got good versus
evil in the ultimate
head to head battle.

1025
01:32:19,668 --> 01:32:21,770
The villains gotta
die in every film and
that's what we have!

1026
01:32:21,870 --> 01:32:25,641
We got this moment
right now and we can
capture it on film!

1027
01:32:27,075 --> 01:32:28,577
You sick bastard!

1028
01:32:28,677 --> 01:32:30,412
Yeah! That's right!,
I am sick!

1029
01:32:30,512 --> 01:32:34,950
God, I thought you were the one
that was messed up? Jesus!
Look at me, huh?

1030
01:32:35,050 --> 01:32:36,284
[laughs]

1031
01:32:36,384 --> 01:32:38,954
I planned all this!

1032
01:32:39,054 --> 01:32:40,355
[laughs]

1033
01:32:40,455 --> 01:32:42,691
I got the church
bells now, baby!

1034
01:32:42,791 --> 01:32:43,592
Huh?

1035
01:32:43,692 --> 01:32:45,193
Let's fucking
do it right now!

1036
01:32:45,293 --> 01:32:46,461
Let's fucking do this right now!

1037
01:32:46,561 --> 01:32:49,598
You stab me in the heart
and you fucking kill me.

1038
01:32:49,698 --> 01:32:50,498
Get it on film.

1039
01:32:50,599 --> 01:32:52,735
Think of the ending, man!

1040
01:32:52,835 --> 01:32:55,037
'Cause, you can kill
me!...

1041
01:32:55,137 --> 01:32:58,240
but I'm in the movie.

1042
01:32:58,340 --> 01:33:01,076
That means I live forever.

1043
01:33:03,779 --> 01:33:06,014
You stupid fuck.

1044
01:33:06,114 --> 01:33:08,784
You want a climax
to your film?

1045
01:33:09,752 --> 01:33:12,688
I'll give you a climax...

1046
01:33:12,788 --> 01:33:14,623
and I'm gonna get
the fucking credit!

1047
01:33:19,461 --> 01:33:21,664
Yeah, try to edit that!

1048
01:33:23,699 --> 01:33:27,335
[panting]

1049
01:33:57,766 --> 01:33:59,735
[gun shot]

1050
01:34:05,674 --> 01:34:08,610
[Weather report]
A beautiful day in sunny Los
Angeles this afternoon

1051
01:34:08,711 --> 01:34:12,748
We have sunny skies, a light
breeze and warm temperatures.

1052
01:34:12,848 --> 01:34:15,450
Currently is 82 degrees here in
Hollywood...

1053
01:34:15,550 --> 01:34:20,222
70's at the beaches, and we are
looking at the low 90's in the
Valleys...

1054
01:34:23,959 --> 01:34:25,894
The whole thing
just looked so real.

1055
01:34:25,994 --> 01:34:27,730
This is really gonna be fun.

1056
01:34:27,830 --> 01:34:29,564
I'm excited
to release it.

1057
01:34:29,664 --> 01:34:31,066
Well you know,
if it wasn't for

1058
01:34:31,166 --> 01:34:33,268
the effects of
my man Harry here,

1059
01:34:33,368 --> 01:34:35,938
none of that would
have been made possible.

1060
01:34:37,672 --> 01:34:39,207
Ha Ha Industries?

1061
01:34:42,044 --> 01:34:44,412
Yeah, I think that it kind
of laughs at ya.

1062
01:34:45,480 --> 01:34:46,915
[Everyone laughs]

1063
01:34:47,015 --> 01:34:49,017
When Travis first brought
me this idea,

1064
01:34:49,117 --> 01:34:51,920
I just
knew right away that it
was something special...

1065
01:34:53,355 --> 01:34:56,224
...But you had to have done just
right, otherwise, you couldn't
pull it off.

1066
01:34:56,324 --> 01:34:58,526
I stand behind my work.

1067
01:34:58,626 --> 01:35:00,428
So my partner Harry
Hawke designed this.

1068
01:35:00,528 --> 01:35:03,832
This is the pack you wear
for the actors when you're
doing the stab scene.

1069
01:35:03,932 --> 01:35:05,400
The cool thing
about though, is
that it's invincible.

1070
01:35:05,500 --> 01:35:07,669
So if you stab it with
a knife, the blade
can't go through.

1071
01:35:07,770 --> 01:35:09,571
Your actor's
always protected.

1072
01:35:09,671 --> 01:35:11,706
See.

1073
01:35:11,807 --> 01:35:14,009
It's going to
revolutionize the
film industry.

1074
01:35:14,109 --> 01:35:15,677
So what do you
think Mr. Phillips.

1075
01:35:15,778 --> 01:35:16,945
we have a deal?

1076
01:35:17,045 --> 01:35:19,047
We have more than
a deal my friend.

1077
01:35:19,147 --> 01:35:21,716
As a matter of fact,
I'd like to green-light
the sequel

1078
01:35:21,817 --> 01:35:24,719
and we should discuss the
franchise rights as well.

1079
01:35:27,689 --> 01:35:29,091
Let's do the deal.

1080
01:35:31,093 --> 01:35:33,661
-Here we go.
-We got it! We got it! We got
it!

1081
01:35:33,762 --> 01:35:37,833
Yes we did. We're gonna have a
lot of work to do if we plan to
do a next one.

1082
01:35:37,933 --> 01:35:39,134
-Well, hold on a
second guys...
-Exactly

1083
01:35:39,234 --> 01:35:41,636
We gotta talk about safety
first

1084
01:35:41,736 --> 01:35:46,508
before we talk about
another one 'cause I'm
not taking another...
crowbar to the skull!

1085
01:35:46,608 --> 01:35:49,344
[all laugh]

1086
01:35:52,180 --> 01:35:53,681
So what do you
think Mr. Hawke.

1087
01:35:53,782 --> 01:35:56,018
You, ah, ready
for a sequel?

1088
01:35:56,118 --> 01:35:58,220
I think I'm ready
to "shoot" again.

1089
01:35:58,320 --> 01:36:00,856
And I'm ready to
speak German again.

1090
01:36:09,531 --> 01:36:11,834
[Newscast]
Beautiful weather for the next
few days...

1091
01:36:11,934 --> 01:36:13,936
and back to you, Tracey

1092
01:36:15,838 --> 01:36:20,442
These warm days have been nice,
but it does look like storms
are headed our way.

1093
01:36:20,542 --> 01:36:25,881
Switching gears: It
appears than an anonymous
source has lead police to
recover the gun used

1094
01:36:25,981 --> 01:36:29,885
in he shooting of Lane
Mitchell Hayes who was currently
out of jail on parole.

1095
01:36:29,985 --> 01:36:36,124
The gun belonged to
Francis Jamal Jefferson,
a known drug dealer and
prostitution ring-leader.

1096
01:36:36,224 --> 01:36:40,863
Police believe
that the death of Hayes
was most likely drug and
prostitution related

1097
01:36:40,963 --> 01:36:42,965
given his prior history.

1098
01:36:43,065 --> 01:36:45,800
Jefferson's currently being held
without bail.

1099
01:36:47,002 --> 01:36:48,803
Now we switch gears
to entertainment news,

1100
01:36:48,904 --> 01:36:52,941
where the question
still remains: where is
Gabrielle Stone?

1101
01:36:53,041 --> 01:36:55,643
Why don't you just let
me act in this and you
can focus on directing.

1102
01:36:56,244 --> 01:36:58,213
I already set up the cameras

1103
01:36:58,313 --> 01:37:01,649
You can't be seen
because shes expecting
to be with me.

1104
01:37:01,749 --> 01:37:04,019
But I get to act in
the next one, right?

1105
01:37:06,421 --> 01:37:08,456
Keep the vest tight.

1106
01:37:08,556 --> 01:37:11,559
Harry's gonna be in
a half an hour to put the
blood packs on you.

1107
01:37:12,394 --> 01:37:14,029
-You good?
-Yeah.

1108
01:37:14,129 --> 01:37:17,165
Listen, aren't we supposed to go
this? Like go over safety stuff?

1109
01:37:20,002 --> 01:37:21,904
What's the
matter with you?

1110
01:37:24,139 --> 01:37:29,111
And people are wondering
if the disappearance is
part of a publicity stunt.

1111
01:37:30,378 --> 01:37:33,882
We'll have the answer
to that mystery at 11.
