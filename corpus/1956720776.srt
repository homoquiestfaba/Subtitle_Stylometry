1
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:34,633


2
00:00:34,668 --> 00:00:35,333
(panting)

3
00:00:35,368 --> 00:00:36,134
Jim Till.

4
00:00:36,169 --> 00:00:38,603
October 27th.

5
00:00:38,638 --> 00:00:41,606
I feel I better start recording
what's been going on around here

6
00:00:41,641 --> 00:00:43,608
because I fear I'm losing my
mind

7
00:00:43,643 --> 00:00:44,543
but I'm not crazy.

8
00:00:44,578 --> 00:00:46,378
There are orbs here.

9
00:00:46,413 --> 00:00:48,814
I seen like, three of 'em.

10
00:00:48,849 --> 00:00:52,217
They're like those transparent
balls you see on TV

11
00:00:52,252 --> 00:00:53,852
and in photographs.

12
00:00:53,887 --> 00:00:56,655
I'm not going crazy, but like
on the precipice.

13
00:00:56,690 --> 00:00:57,856
Something's going on in my
head.

14
00:00:57,891 --> 00:01:01,359


15
00:01:02,629 --> 00:01:04,563
January 27th.

16
00:01:04,598 --> 00:01:06,331
It's three AM.

17
00:01:06,366 --> 00:01:10,602
I followed a little girl into
the warehouse here.

18
00:01:10,637 --> 00:01:13,105
Where is she?

19
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:17,509
I need to talk to her.

20
00:01:17,544 --> 00:01:19,478
Little girl?

21
00:01:19,513 --> 00:01:21,546
Where are you?

22
00:01:21,581 --> 00:01:22,848
Where are you...

23
00:01:22,883 --> 00:01:24,850
Little girl!

24
00:01:24,885 --> 00:01:28,386
They make you see things that
you don't wanna see.

25
00:01:28,421 --> 00:01:30,589


26
00:01:30,624 --> 00:01:33,692
They make you do things that
you don't wanna do.

27
00:01:33,727 --> 00:01:34,793


28
00:01:34,828 --> 00:01:36,862
They like to make you afraid.

29
00:01:36,897 --> 00:01:40,332


30
00:01:40,367 --> 00:01:43,735
Whatever scares you the
most...

31
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:45,370
they know what it is.

32
00:01:45,405 --> 00:01:46,738


33
00:01:46,773 --> 00:01:48,507
I think I pissed them off.

34
00:01:48,542 --> 00:01:51,643


35
00:01:52,812 --> 00:01:56,648
June seventh.

36
00:01:56,683 --> 00:01:57,549
Something's up.

37
00:01:57,584 --> 00:02:00,719


38
00:02:00,754 --> 00:02:01,720
They're coming back.

39
00:02:01,755 --> 00:02:03,288
They're coming again.

40
00:02:03,323 --> 00:02:04,890
They're, like, inside my head.

41
00:02:04,925 --> 00:02:07,459


42
00:02:07,494 --> 00:02:08,827
I gotta get into this tank.

43
00:02:08,862 --> 00:02:10,428
I'll be safe in this tank.

44
00:02:10,463 --> 00:02:13,231


45
00:02:13,266 --> 00:02:15,600
(panting)

46
00:02:15,635 --> 00:02:23,341


47
00:02:23,376 --> 00:02:23,942
Ah!

48
00:02:23,977 --> 00:02:26,578
(Banging)

49
00:02:27,914 --> 00:02:28,847
No!

50
00:02:28,882 --> 00:02:31,449
Ah!

51
00:02:33,286 --> 00:02:37,455
(Otherworldly sounds)

52
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:47,533


53
00:02:47,535 --> 00:02:52,637


54
00:02:52,672 --> 00:02:54,472
(grunting)

55
00:02:54,507 --> 00:02:56,942
Ah, aah!

56
00:02:56,977 --> 00:02:58,276
(Screaming)

57
00:02:58,311 --> 00:03:01,513
(banging)

58
00:03:01,548 --> 00:03:06,218
Come on, come on, come on!

59
00:03:06,253 --> 00:03:07,285
My name is Jim Till.

60
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:08,620
I'm an assistant professor

61
00:03:08,655 --> 00:03:10,288
of theoretical physics at
Stanford

62
00:03:10,323 --> 00:03:11,823
and I've encountered a
phenomenon

63
00:03:11,858 --> 00:03:13,892
that I can't explain.

64
00:03:13,927 --> 00:03:17,295
I came through this door and I
looked to my left

65
00:03:17,330 --> 00:03:21,299
and sitting right around there,
by those boxes at the very end,

66
00:03:21,334 --> 00:03:24,236
was aa woman dressed in black.

67
00:03:24,271 --> 00:03:25,503
Babe, we gotta go.

68
00:03:25,538 --> 00:03:26,571
Come on, pack it up.

69
00:03:26,606 --> 00:03:28,306
See this guy.

70
00:03:28,341 --> 00:03:30,308
- He's Ashen's brother. -Wow?

71
00:03:30,343 --> 00:03:33,411
- Ashen has an older brother.
- Okay?

72
00:03:33,446 --> 00:03:34,980
- Ashen, from the winery? -I
know who Ashen is.

73
00:03:35,015 --> 00:03:36,982
Why are you treating it like
it's some conspiracy

74
00:03:37,017 --> 00:03:37,516
that he has an older brother?

75
00:03:37,551 --> 00:03:38,917
Dax, he talked to us

76
00:03:38,952 --> 00:03:40,552
for an hour about his family

77
00:03:40,587 --> 00:03:42,454
and not once did he mention he
had a brother,

78
00:03:42,489 --> 00:03:44,556
let alone one that's a
theoretical physicist.

79
00:03:44,591 --> 00:03:45,657
I mean, don't you think that's
a little strange?

80
00:03:45,692 --> 00:03:46,725
No, I don't.

81
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:47,892
Self-centered little rich
pricks

82
00:03:47,927 --> 00:03:48,994
don't like to gloat about

83
00:03:49,029 --> 00:03:50,829
their more accomplished
siblings.

84
00:03:50,864 --> 00:03:53,732
You're right. I'm sorry. I'm
just so excited about this.

85
00:03:53,767 --> 00:03:56,434
This is an amazing, amazing
opportunity.

86
00:03:56,469 --> 00:03:58,603
Out of all the paranormal
investigators,

87
00:03:58,638 --> 00:04:00,572
we were the first to be chosen

88
00:04:00,607 --> 00:04:02,707
to investigate one of the most
haunted places

89
00:04:02,742 --> 00:04:04,843
in the United States. Do you
know why?

90
00:04:04,878 --> 00:04:06,478
Because Ashen has a hard on
for you.

91
00:04:06,513 --> 00:04:09,814
Yes, and because I'm a kick
ass producer.

92
00:04:09,849 --> 00:04:11,583
And you're very humble.

93
00:04:11,618 --> 00:04:13,685
Drink this. I don't think you
need it but

94
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:14,753
This is coffee.

95
00:04:14,788 --> 00:04:15,720
Yes, it is.

96
00:04:15,755 --> 00:04:17,555
Very good coffee.

97
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:19,724
I can't have coffee. It's not
good for the baby.

98
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:21,593
Shit. I'm sorry. I know. I
keep forgetting.

99
00:04:21,628 --> 00:04:23,561
You keep forgetting? Wow.

100
00:04:23,596 --> 00:04:25,030
That makes me feel all fuzzy
inside.

101
00:04:25,065 --> 00:04:27,465
Stop. Can you have tea?

102
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:28,767
- Can I get you tea? -Yes, I
can have tea.

103
00:04:28,802 --> 00:04:30,702
Decaf? Organic?

104
00:04:30,737 --> 00:04:31,970
Baby friendly? Anything else?

105
00:04:32,005 --> 00:04:33,471
Come on. Let's go!

106
00:04:33,506 --> 00:04:36,875
Little bit of eye candy for
the network execs,

107
00:04:36,910 --> 00:04:38,443
because they tend to like that
kinda thing.

108
00:04:38,478 --> 00:04:40,011
Yeah. Actually, I think this
is

109
00:04:40,046 --> 00:04:42,580
Mike's first and last day with
us, right?

110
00:04:42,615 --> 00:04:44,883
All right, and that's my
loving girlfriend.

111
00:04:44,918 --> 00:04:46,451
- Okay. -Mike.

112
00:04:46,486 --> 00:04:47,952
- I got you a coffee. -Oh,
nice.

113
00:04:47,987 --> 00:04:49,888
Thank you, brother.

114
00:04:49,923 --> 00:04:51,856
And you are...

115
00:04:51,891 --> 00:04:53,391
Hi, I'm Jason Meeks

116
00:04:53,426 --> 00:04:54,492
and this is a digital voice
recorder

117
00:04:54,527 --> 00:04:56,728
for capturing EVPs.

118
00:04:56,763 --> 00:04:58,797
Or...

119
00:04:58,832 --> 00:05:01,366
recording ghosty ghosts.

120
00:05:01,401 --> 00:05:02,434
And have you ever recorded
one?

121
00:05:02,469 --> 00:05:03,902
I believe I have.

122
00:05:03,937 --> 00:05:05,737
On several occasions.

123
00:05:05,772 --> 00:05:07,372
With all the cell phones
polluting our airwaves,

124
00:05:07,407 --> 00:05:08,606
you're still convinced

125
00:05:08,641 --> 00:05:10,075
that what you're hearing are
ghosts?

126
00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:11,776
Sarah's a little bit of a
skeptic

127
00:05:11,811 --> 00:05:14,512
and also a little bit of a
ho-bag.

128
00:05:14,547 --> 00:05:16,114
Jason still believes in the
tooth fairy.

129
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:18,350
For the record, I stopped
believing in the tooth fairy

130
00:05:18,385 --> 00:05:20,118
months ago.

131
00:05:20,153 --> 00:05:21,453
And what do you do here?

132
00:05:21,488 --> 00:05:23,088
I'm Maya Peterson.

133
00:05:23,123 --> 00:05:25,023
I'm the sound dude.

134
00:05:25,058 --> 00:05:25,957
Mike.

135
00:05:25,992 --> 00:05:26,758
Mike.

136
00:05:26,793 --> 00:05:27,992
Mike?

137
00:05:28,027 --> 00:05:29,861
Could you not do that, please?

138
00:05:29,896 --> 00:05:31,663
Use the fish eye lens.

139
00:05:31,698 --> 00:05:32,697
(Laughing)

140
00:05:32,732 --> 00:05:33,998
Mike!

141
00:05:34,033 --> 00:05:35,066
Stop!

142
00:05:35,101 --> 00:05:36,935
Tilt/shift that ass!

143
00:05:36,970 --> 00:05:38,036
Theresa!

144
00:05:38,071 --> 00:05:48,113


145
00:05:48,115 --> 00:06:08,133


146
00:06:08,135 --> 00:06:28,153


147
00:06:28,155 --> 00:06:49,941


148
00:06:51,845 --> 00:06:53,545
Hi, I'm Sarah Hall and I'm
standing

149
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:54,913
in front of the King's Ransom
Winery,

150
00:06:54,948 --> 00:06:57,015
located in Guerneville,
California.

151
00:06:57,050 --> 00:06:59,017
King's Ransom is widely
considered

152
00:06:59,052 --> 00:07:02,120
as one of the most haunted
places in the United States,

153
00:07:02,155 --> 00:07:03,555
and not until now has any

154
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:05,924
paranormal investigations been
allowed. No.

155
00:07:05,959 --> 00:07:07,225
You know what? Since we're
stopped,

156
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:08,193
I need to check the white
balance.

157
00:07:08,228 --> 00:07:10,462
Maya?

158
00:07:10,497 --> 00:07:11,996
Awesome. Thanks, baby.

159
00:07:12,031 --> 00:07:13,765
Should I take from the top, or
just where I stopped?

160
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,033
- Keep going. We're gonna cut
in. -No, no, no.

161
00:07:15,068 --> 00:07:17,469
Take it from the top, you're
doing great.

162
00:07:17,504 --> 00:07:19,103
We're gonna take it from the
top.

163
00:07:19,138 --> 00:07:20,839
(Blows raspberry)

164
00:07:20,874 --> 00:07:22,941
Okay, ow.

165
00:07:22,976 --> 00:07:24,476
Hi, I'm Sarah Hall and I'm
standing

166
00:07:24,511 --> 00:07:25,844
in front of the King's Ransom
Winery,

167
00:07:25,879 --> 00:07:28,079
located in Guerneville,
California.

168
00:07:28,114 --> 00:07:29,914
King's Ransom is widely
considered

169
00:07:29,949 --> 00:07:32,750
as one of the most haunted
places in the United States.

170
00:07:32,785 --> 00:07:35,753
This is the only weekend out
of the entire year

171
00:07:35,788 --> 00:07:37,555
that the winery is closed
down,

172
00:07:37,590 --> 00:07:40,792
and the owner, Ashen Till, has
given us full access.

173
00:07:40,827 --> 00:07:43,061
So for the next 48 hours,

174
00:07:43,096 --> 00:07:46,664
we have this entire place to
ourselves.

175
00:07:46,699 --> 00:07:48,166
It actually used to be a
logging company

176
00:07:48,201 --> 00:07:50,502
before it became a winery.

177
00:07:50,537 --> 00:07:52,604
That's my great-grandfather.

178
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:56,975
And this was his wife, Rachel.

179
00:07:57,010 --> 00:07:59,978
So that's the famous Rachel
Till.

180
00:08:00,013 --> 00:08:01,079
She's beautiful.

181
00:08:01,114 --> 00:08:02,981
She was the first suicide.

182
00:08:03,016 --> 00:08:04,282
When was that?

183
00:08:04,317 --> 00:08:06,551
1932.

184
00:08:06,586 --> 00:08:08,887
They said that she heard
voices.

185
00:08:08,922 --> 00:08:10,989
She stabbed herself to
death...

186
00:08:11,024 --> 00:08:12,156
Thirteen times.

187
00:08:12,191 --> 00:08:15,593
How does somebody stab
themselves 13 times?

188
00:08:15,628 --> 00:08:17,595
You think after the first one,
they'd be like "ow," you know,

189
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:18,263
and stop.

190
00:08:18,298 --> 00:08:20,131
You'd think.

191
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:21,966
And who else committed
suicide?

192
00:08:22,001 --> 00:08:24,702
Rory Devink, my grandfather's
second wife.

193
00:08:24,737 --> 00:08:26,304
And how did she kill herself?

194
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:27,939
She also stabbed herself to
death.

195
00:08:27,974 --> 00:08:29,207
The same way.

196
00:08:29,242 --> 00:08:30,742
Thirteen times?

197
00:08:30,777 --> 00:08:32,610
I'm not sure how many.

198
00:08:32,645 --> 00:08:35,179
And what about the third girl?

199
00:08:35,214 --> 00:08:37,015
Beatrice Blaine.

200
00:08:37,050 --> 00:08:38,650
But she was murdered.

201
00:08:38,685 --> 00:08:40,118
Tell me about that.

202
00:08:40,153 --> 00:08:42,053
It was 1972.

203
00:08:42,088 --> 00:08:46,257
Her father Joe Blaine, he was
a machinist working here.

204
00:08:46,292 --> 00:08:48,092
They say that he raped her.

205
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:49,827
And evidently he got her
pregnant,

206
00:08:49,862 --> 00:08:51,963
and to cover it up, he killed
her.

207
00:08:51,998 --> 00:08:53,097
How?

208
00:08:53,132 --> 00:08:55,166
(Screaming)

209
00:08:55,201 --> 00:08:57,569
He threw her down on these
blades.

210
00:08:57,604 --> 00:08:58,970
Pretty gruesome.

211
00:08:59,005 --> 00:09:00,838
You think there may be a
demonic presence here?

212
00:09:00,873 --> 00:09:03,641
I mean, that's a really evil
thing to do.

213
00:09:03,676 --> 00:09:04,642
I don't know about that.

214
00:09:04,677 --> 00:09:05,877
I mean, I definitely think

215
00:09:05,912 --> 00:09:08,246
Joe Blaine was a disturbed
individual.

216
00:09:08,281 --> 00:09:09,747
And what's the auger for?

217
00:09:09,782 --> 00:09:11,316
It's how we crush the grapes.

218
00:09:11,351 --> 00:09:14,852
Okay, so, so far we have the
two suicides and a murder,

219
00:09:14,887 --> 00:09:16,955
so we're missing the third
suicide.

220
00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:18,957
Supposedly after Joe murdered
his daughter,

221
00:09:18,992 --> 00:09:22,293
he went into his office and
shot himself in the head...

222
00:09:22,328 --> 00:09:23,795
13 times.

223
00:09:23,830 --> 00:09:25,763


224
00:09:25,798 --> 00:09:28,166
It was a joke.

225
00:09:28,201 --> 00:09:30,168
So the house was built in the
1800s.

226
00:09:30,203 --> 00:09:32,203
The late 1800s.

227
00:09:32,238 --> 00:09:35,239
When we were kids, my brother
Jim dared us

228
00:09:35,274 --> 00:09:36,975
to spend the night here.

229
00:09:37,010 --> 00:09:38,743
That's a beautiful piano over
there.

230
00:09:38,778 --> 00:09:39,611
What year is that?

231
00:09:39,646 --> 00:09:41,079
It's 1870s.

232
00:09:41,114 --> 00:09:42,180
Square grand.

233
00:09:42,215 --> 00:09:44,682
Made out of rosewood.

234
00:09:44,717 --> 00:09:45,984
I wouldn't touch it.

235
00:09:46,019 --> 00:09:50,088


236
00:09:50,123 --> 00:09:52,724
And this, uh...

237
00:09:52,759 --> 00:09:54,993
this was Rory Devink's
bedroom.

238
00:09:55,028 --> 00:09:56,628
Your grandfather's...

239
00:09:56,663 --> 00:09:57,695
- ...second wife. -Second wife.

240
00:09:57,730 --> 00:09:59,097
Yeah.

241
00:09:59,132 --> 00:10:01,199
But she hardly stayed here.

242
00:10:01,234 --> 00:10:03,768
She was paranoid that the
world was coming to an end

243
00:10:03,803 --> 00:10:07,772
and she built a bomb shelter
and literally lived in it.

244
00:10:07,807 --> 00:10:09,040
I guess she went a little nuts

245
00:10:09,075 --> 00:10:11,309
because she started dining on
rats.

246
00:10:11,344 --> 00:10:13,111
Ew...

247
00:10:13,146 --> 00:10:15,146
And where is this bomb
shelter?

248
00:10:15,181 --> 00:10:19,150
The entrance is in the garden
behind the house.

249
00:10:19,185 --> 00:10:22,353
So this is the room that you
and Rebi stayed in?

250
00:10:22,388 --> 00:10:24,088
I did, but Rebi,

251
00:10:24,123 --> 00:10:27,425
sheshe stayed in a room across
the hall.

252
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:28,726
(Beeping)

253
00:10:28,761 --> 00:10:31,095
Rachel Till's old room.

254
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:32,330
It was the middle of the
night.

255
00:10:32,365 --> 00:10:37,068
I heard her screaming and I
got up

256
00:10:37,103 --> 00:10:39,404
and I ran through here...

257
00:10:39,439 --> 00:10:46,144


258
00:10:46,179 --> 00:10:49,047
...and I saw her standing on
the bed

259
00:10:49,082 --> 00:10:52,016
looking at me like she was
possessed.

260
00:10:52,051 --> 00:10:56,087


261
00:10:56,122 --> 00:10:57,288
Maybe she was messing with
you?

262
00:10:57,323 --> 00:10:59,057
No.

263
00:10:59,092 --> 00:11:01,125
Did you ever ask her what that
was about?

264
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:03,428
She died not long after the
incident.

265
00:11:03,463 --> 00:11:05,897
I'm so sorry.

266
00:11:05,932 --> 00:11:07,865
Can I ask how?

267
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:09,400
Car crash.

268
00:11:09,435 --> 00:11:21,779


269
00:11:21,814 --> 00:11:24,916
Maya, rig a light.

270
00:11:24,951 --> 00:11:26,451
What are you guys doing?

271
00:11:26,486 --> 00:11:28,119
You unscrew the flashlight
just enough

272
00:11:28,154 --> 00:11:29,187
for a ghost to be able to turn
it on.

273
00:11:29,222 --> 00:11:31,122
Yeah, so if the flashlight
comes on

274
00:11:31,157 --> 00:11:34,025
it means that you're probably
going to die.

275
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:34,859
Hey!

276
00:11:34,894 --> 00:11:36,427
Upstairs is off limits.

277
00:11:36,462 --> 00:11:37,962
What?

278
00:11:37,997 --> 00:11:39,030
My sister's stuff's up there

279
00:11:39,065 --> 00:11:41,099
and my dad would freak.

280
00:11:41,134 --> 00:11:43,367
Besides it's locked and I
don't have a key.

281
00:11:43,402 --> 00:11:46,204
We're paranormal investigators
that can't go into the attic...

282
00:11:46,239 --> 00:11:48,106
Yeah. Sorry.

283
00:11:48,141 --> 00:11:49,907
Dax, we don't need to get up
there.

284
00:11:49,942 --> 00:11:52,910
Yes, we do. We specifically
asked to go into the attic

285
00:11:52,945 --> 00:11:54,245
and now all of a sudden we
can't.

286
00:11:59,385 --> 00:12:00,318
Sorry.

287
00:12:00,353 --> 00:12:01,919
Thank you.

288
00:12:01,954 --> 00:12:03,755
So how many acres is it?

289
00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:05,123
Three thousand,

290
00:12:05,158 --> 00:12:06,891
three hundred sixty of it
vineyard land.

291
00:12:06,926 --> 00:12:10,228
About eight square miles, with
two miles surrounding us.

292
00:12:10,263 --> 00:12:11,963
So Ashen, when are we getting
married?

293
00:12:11,998 --> 00:12:16,200
Sarah's a little bit of a gold
digger, I should warn you.

294
00:12:16,235 --> 00:12:18,369
So how long have you two been
friends?

295
00:12:18,404 --> 00:12:21,506
- Since we were kids. -We grew
up on the same street.

296
00:12:21,541 --> 00:12:25,376
So, in this stomach is a baby
boy or a baby girl.

297
00:12:25,411 --> 00:12:26,844
You really don't know?

298
00:12:26,879 --> 00:12:28,479
I want it to be a surprise.

299
00:12:28,514 --> 00:12:30,815
What are you hoping for?

300
00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:33,151
A lesbian.

301
00:12:33,186 --> 00:12:35,153
- Just like her mom. -Yeah, you
know, thanks to you,

302
00:12:35,188 --> 00:12:36,954
I'm seriously considering
going there.

303
00:12:36,989 --> 00:12:39,390
Wouldn't be the first time.

304
00:12:39,425 --> 00:12:43,227
Well, I think Theresa is gonna
make a rockin' mom.

305
00:12:43,262 --> 00:12:44,061
Thank you.

306
00:12:44,096 --> 00:12:46,264
So what is Dax's problem?

307
00:12:46,299 --> 00:12:47,865
We've just been having a
stupid argument.

308
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:50,201
We've been having it ever
since I became pregnant.

309
00:12:50,236 --> 00:12:52,804
Dax thinks that the baby was
conceived in LA,

310
00:12:52,839 --> 00:12:55,840
and Theresa thinks that the
baby was conceived here.

311
00:12:55,875 --> 00:12:57,575
- At this winery? -Yep.

312
00:12:57,610 --> 00:13:00,044
We came up here a few of months ago just to scout locations

313
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:02,280
and get permission to ghost
hunt.

314
00:13:02,315 --> 00:13:04,282
Grabbed a couple of bottles of
wine.

315
00:13:04,317 --> 00:13:05,583
Went for a hike along the
property line.

316
00:13:05,618 --> 00:13:08,886
Got totally drunk.

317
00:13:08,921 --> 00:13:10,021
Don't remember making love

318
00:13:10,056 --> 00:13:12,490
but we were completely
trashed, so...

319
00:13:12,525 --> 00:13:14,826
Got it.

320
00:13:14,861 --> 00:13:15,893
This place is awesome, right?

321
00:13:15,928 --> 00:13:16,961
Compared to that ratted out

322
00:13:16,996 --> 00:13:18,162
asylum we investigated?

323
00:13:18,197 --> 00:13:20,398
- That asylum was gross. -And
dormant.

324
00:13:20,433 --> 00:13:22,600
How many investigations have
you guys done so far?

325
00:13:22,635 --> 00:13:27,138
This'll be our fourth but the
other three were lame.

326
00:13:27,173 --> 00:13:28,406
- Very lame. -How does it work?

327
00:13:28,441 --> 00:13:30,441
I mean, do you sell it to a
network or something?

328
00:13:30,476 --> 00:13:32,009
Well, right now just the
internet

329
00:13:32,044 --> 00:13:33,211
but we're stepping up our
game.

330
00:13:33,246 --> 00:13:34,912
We invested some more money in
gear

331
00:13:34,947 --> 00:13:36,080
and we just hired Mike,

332
00:13:36,115 --> 00:13:38,216
our newest ghost hunter.

333
00:13:38,251 --> 00:13:39,851
You're awesome by the way.

334
00:13:39,886 --> 00:13:40,852
I like to think so.

335
00:13:40,887 --> 00:13:42,253
(Giggling)

336
00:13:42,288 --> 00:13:51,629


337
00:13:51,664 --> 00:13:52,530
(door creaking)

338
00:13:52,565 --> 00:13:55,566


339
00:13:55,601 --> 00:13:57,068
If you need to make a call,
you're better off

340
00:13:57,103 --> 00:13:58,135
using a land line.

341
00:13:58,170 --> 00:14:00,338
Yeah, the service here sucks.

342
00:14:00,373 --> 00:14:02,206
I told my old man to put in
his own cell tower,

343
00:14:02,241 --> 00:14:04,075
but he thinks that the
microwaves

344
00:14:04,110 --> 00:14:05,643
contaminate the grapes.

345
00:14:05,678 --> 00:14:07,945


346
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:10,348
- Boo! -There you are.

347
00:14:10,383 --> 00:14:12,416
Just wanted to see how these
new EMFs were working.

348
00:14:12,451 --> 00:14:13,317
Any spikes?

349
00:14:13,352 --> 00:14:14,084
Ah, no. Nothing.

350
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:15,887
Maybe I'll sneak around by
myself

351
00:14:15,922 --> 00:14:17,521
and try to get some footage
away from the...

352
00:14:17,556 --> 00:14:20,157
Do what you gotta do. Just be
discreet, okay?

353
00:14:20,192 --> 00:14:22,460
I promised Ashen we wouldn't
run amok.

354
00:14:22,495 --> 00:14:23,661
Got it.

355
00:14:23,696 --> 00:14:24,896
One of our employees thought

356
00:14:24,931 --> 00:14:26,631
the place was demon possessed.

357
00:14:26,666 --> 00:14:29,267
Tried to burn it down when I
was a kid.

358
00:14:29,302 --> 00:14:32,503
Barely got out of here with my
life.

359
00:14:32,538 --> 00:14:35,406
My dad drank himself to sleep
with a cigarette in his mouth.

360
00:14:35,441 --> 00:14:38,442
Ran out of the house, forgot
about me.

361
00:14:38,477 --> 00:14:40,177
Solid year in the hospital on
a morphine diet

362
00:14:40,212 --> 00:14:42,113
getting skin grafts.

363
00:14:42,148 --> 00:14:45,082
Pain was so much fun I left my
body.

364
00:14:45,117 --> 00:14:47,618
Is that why you ghost hunt?

365
00:14:47,653 --> 00:14:49,987
I've seen the other side.

366
00:14:50,022 --> 00:14:51,322
I know it's real.

367
00:14:51,357 --> 00:14:53,491


368
00:14:53,526 --> 00:14:56,127
You ready? You can put your
gear in the museum.

369
00:14:56,162 --> 00:14:58,596
Just don't scratch anything.

370
00:14:58,631 --> 00:15:11,709


371
00:15:11,744 --> 00:15:15,146
What the hell is this?

372
00:15:15,181 --> 00:15:17,982
What do you think it is?

373
00:15:18,017 --> 00:15:20,318
You know how I feel about
guns.

374
00:15:20,353 --> 00:15:22,320


375
00:15:22,355 --> 00:15:23,321
Mike.

376
00:15:23,356 --> 00:15:25,323
We're up here all by
ourselves.

377
00:15:25,358 --> 00:15:26,590
You don't want a little bit of
protection?

378
00:15:26,625 --> 00:15:28,626
Okay, but you can't shoot a
ghost

379
00:15:28,661 --> 00:15:29,961
and there's nobody here.

380
00:15:29,996 --> 00:15:31,262
Yeah, that's a perfect time

381
00:15:31,297 --> 00:15:31,729
to rob the place.

382
00:15:31,764 --> 00:15:33,397
Maya.

383
00:15:33,432 --> 00:15:34,498
Mike...

384
00:15:34,533 --> 00:15:42,206


385
00:15:50,049 --> 00:16:00,224


386
00:16:01,293 --> 00:16:02,994
So we've just finished the
tour

387
00:16:03,029 --> 00:16:03,995
and everyone's getting prepped

388
00:16:04,030 --> 00:16:05,496
for our first investigation.

389
00:16:05,531 --> 00:16:07,465
We're gonna start with the
original winery,

390
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:10,568
the part that's over a hundred
years old.

391
00:16:10,603 --> 00:16:13,437
If there's something here,
we're gonna find it.

392
00:16:13,472 --> 00:16:15,706
I've been looking through
these videos.

393
00:16:15,741 --> 00:16:19,343
They're uploaded by Jim Till,
Ashen Till's older brother.

394
00:16:19,378 --> 00:16:21,645
He talks about these balls of
light.

395
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:24,181
Now, they're pretty common in
photographs.

396
00:16:24,216 --> 00:16:28,285
They're usually just specks of
dust on the lens.

397
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:32,523
But if he's seen these in
person...

398
00:16:32,558 --> 00:16:37,094
Gotta make a note to ask Ashen
about his brother.

399
00:16:37,129 --> 00:16:39,230
Maybe I can get an interview.

400
00:16:39,265 --> 00:16:41,532
Maybe he can help us.

401
00:16:41,567 --> 00:16:44,568
I've got a really, really good
feeling about this place.

402
00:16:44,603 --> 00:16:47,538
I mean, there is so much dark
history here.

403
00:16:47,573 --> 00:16:50,408
There's an abundance of
violent deaths

404
00:16:50,443 --> 00:16:53,577
and all sorts of unexplainable
phenomena.

405
00:16:53,612 --> 00:17:03,654


406
00:17:03,656 --> 00:17:26,243


407
00:17:26,278 --> 00:17:27,645
Why are these candles lit?

408
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:30,181


409
00:17:30,216 --> 00:17:32,083
Uh, Theresa?

410
00:17:32,118 --> 00:17:34,652
Was someone else down here?
'Cause these candles are lit.

411
00:17:34,687 --> 00:17:35,186
Maybe Jason.

412
00:17:35,221 --> 00:17:37,421
I'll check with him.

413
00:17:37,456 --> 00:17:39,457
Jason, did you light any
candles?

414
00:17:39,492 --> 00:17:42,760
Why would I light candles?

415
00:17:42,795 --> 00:17:43,861
Copy that.

416
00:17:43,896 --> 00:17:45,162
That's a negative from Jason.

417
00:17:45,197 --> 00:17:46,697
Great.

418
00:17:46,732 --> 00:17:49,100
Yeah, I just walked into a
cold spot right here.

419
00:17:49,135 --> 00:17:51,802
Okay. Well, check your TG.

420
00:17:51,837 --> 00:17:53,604
Fifty-nine...

421
00:17:53,639 --> 00:17:54,238
Fifty-four...

422
00:17:54,273 --> 00:17:55,673
Forty-nine...

423
00:17:55,708 --> 00:17:57,608
Are you joking?

424
00:17:57,643 --> 00:17:59,110
Yeah.

425
00:17:59,145 --> 00:18:01,512
Ha ha.

426
00:18:01,547 --> 00:18:04,381
We're not gonna find anything
down here.

427
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:06,884
What makes you so sure about
that?

428
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:08,519
They all killed themselves.

429
00:18:08,554 --> 00:18:11,388
Suicide's a straight shot to
hell.

430
00:18:11,423 --> 00:18:15,659
It's pretty black and white in
your Catholic world, huh?

431
00:18:15,694 --> 00:18:18,662
Uh huh.

432
00:18:18,697 --> 00:18:22,533
Unfinished business is
unfinished business.

433
00:18:22,568 --> 00:18:23,901
Rachel, I hope we're not
intruding.

434
00:18:23,936 --> 00:18:25,769
We just want to understand
you.

435
00:18:25,804 --> 00:18:30,307


436
00:18:30,342 --> 00:18:32,209
- What's on the EVP? -Huh?

437
00:18:32,244 --> 00:18:33,210
Are you running an EVP?

438
00:18:33,245 --> 00:18:33,878
Oh, that's probably

439
00:18:33,913 --> 00:18:36,380
a good idea.

440
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:38,749
I just hate hearing my voice
recorded.

441
00:18:38,784 --> 00:18:43,554


442
00:18:43,589 --> 00:18:48,425
Rachel, why did you stab
yourself 13 times?

443
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:49,260
And why in the stomach?

444
00:18:49,295 --> 00:18:50,861
Why such a painful

445
00:18:50,896 --> 00:18:52,563
and slow death?

446
00:18:52,598 --> 00:18:56,734


447
00:18:56,769 --> 00:18:59,637
Were you trying to get
someone's attention?

448
00:18:59,672 --> 00:19:01,305
Sweetheart, you have our
attention,

449
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:02,840
so go ahead and tell us.

450
00:19:02,875 --> 00:19:05,342


451
00:19:05,377 --> 00:19:06,844
I like to flirt with my
ghosts.

452
00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:08,646


453
00:19:09,648 --> 00:19:13,317
If you're here, give us a
sign.

454
00:19:13,352 --> 00:19:15,753
Come on, ya crazy bitch.

455
00:19:15,788 --> 00:19:20,858


456
00:19:20,893 --> 00:19:22,726
Run an EVP.

457
00:19:22,761 --> 00:19:24,495


458
00:19:24,530 --> 00:19:26,564
Rachel, if you have anything
to say,

459
00:19:26,599 --> 00:19:28,666
I can hear you with this
device.

460
00:19:28,701 --> 00:19:30,768
Tell us why you killed
yourself.

461
00:19:30,803 --> 00:19:34,538
We want to know. We want to
know your story.

462
00:19:34,573 --> 00:19:36,774
We want to know. We want to
know your story.

463
00:19:36,809 --> 00:19:39,510


464
00:19:39,545 --> 00:19:41,745
(faint ghostly whispers)

465
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:42,880


466
00:19:42,915 --> 00:19:44,882
That sounded like something,
right?

467
00:19:44,917 --> 00:19:49,887


468
00:19:49,922 --> 00:19:50,955
Uh, guys?

469
00:19:50,990 --> 00:19:54,792
I'm getting, um...

470
00:19:54,827 --> 00:19:58,395
EMF readings in this dining
room.

471
00:19:58,430 --> 00:19:59,964
He's in the old boardroom.

472
00:19:59,999 --> 00:20:01,498
On the basement floor.

473
00:20:01,533 --> 00:20:03,567
Jason? You're in the old
boardroom.

474
00:20:03,602 --> 00:20:05,236
What kind of readings are you
getting?

475
00:20:05,271 --> 00:20:09,406
Pretty consistent at 2.5
with...

476
00:20:09,441 --> 00:20:11,675
spikes all the way up to 7.

477
00:20:13,912 --> 00:20:15,012
Seven?

478
00:20:15,047 --> 00:20:15,879
Yeah.

479
00:20:15,914 --> 00:20:18,716
(Creaking)

480
00:20:21,754 --> 00:20:23,988
All right, is somebody fucking
with me?

481
00:20:24,023 --> 00:20:26,523
No, no. What's going on?

482
00:20:26,558 --> 00:20:29,994
The door just moved.

483
00:20:30,029 --> 00:20:34,965
And it just got really fucking
cold in here.

484
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,767
Okay, 68...

485
00:20:36,802 --> 00:20:37,935
65...

486
00:20:37,970 --> 00:20:39,803
62...

487
00:20:39,838 --> 00:20:42,339
50...

488
00:20:42,374 --> 00:20:43,907
That's like a 10 degree drop.

489
00:20:43,942 --> 00:20:45,709
That, that's for real.

490
00:20:45,744 --> 00:20:49,480
(Scratching)

491
00:20:49,515 --> 00:20:50,481
Are you guys picking that up?

492
00:20:50,516 --> 00:20:52,449
Do you hear that?

493
00:20:52,484 --> 00:20:55,052
No. What are you hearing?

494
00:20:55,087 --> 00:20:56,920
(Scratching)

495
00:20:56,955 --> 00:20:58,022
I hear scratching.

496
00:20:58,057 --> 00:21:06,597


497
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:10,868
(beeping)

498
00:21:12,338 --> 00:21:13,504
Hold on a second.

499
00:21:13,539 --> 00:21:14,805
Play that back.

500
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:15,839
(Beeping)

501
00:21:19,044 --> 00:21:22,713
So how long have you and Dax
been together?

502
00:21:22,748 --> 00:21:26,684
Um, three to three and a half
years, I guess.

503
00:21:26,719 --> 00:21:30,387
He's kind of a short fuse.

504
00:21:30,422 --> 00:21:31,755
Yeah, I guess.

505
00:21:34,993 --> 00:21:37,828


506
00:21:37,863 --> 00:21:39,496
Maya.

507
00:21:39,531 --> 00:21:41,598
To the left of you?

508
00:21:41,633 --> 00:21:43,934
That's where they found
Rachel's corpse.

509
00:21:43,969 --> 00:21:47,104


510
00:21:47,139 --> 00:21:47,938
Hey, what's goin' on?

511
00:21:47,973 --> 00:21:49,039
Shh.

512
00:21:49,074 --> 00:21:50,874
We got a positive EVP.

513
00:21:50,909 --> 00:21:52,009


514
00:21:52,044 --> 00:21:54,945
(zapping)

515
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:57,448
Theresa, is anybody else in
the winery?

516
00:21:57,483 --> 00:21:58,649
Is there anyone else here?

517
00:21:58,684 --> 00:21:59,883
I'm gonna go check it out.

518
00:21:59,918 --> 00:22:14,631


519
00:22:14,666 --> 00:22:16,400
I saw somebody walk past here.

520
00:22:16,435 --> 00:22:19,069
Are you sure it couldn't have
been something else?

521
00:22:19,104 --> 00:22:21,071
No, I saw it too.

522
00:22:21,106 --> 00:22:26,043


523
00:22:26,078 --> 00:22:28,846
If you've got a message for
me, tell me what it is.

524
00:22:32,117 --> 00:22:32,883
(Beeping)

525
00:22:32,918 --> 00:22:33,984
(rewinding)

526
00:22:34,019 --> 00:22:35,652
...message for me, tell me
what it is.

527
00:22:35,687 --> 00:22:37,054
(Faint ghostly whispers)

528
00:22:37,089 --> 00:22:38,856
Okay, I got something.

529
00:22:38,891 --> 00:22:40,124
Are you sure?

530
00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:42,126
Fuck yeah. I'm gonna listen to
it again.

531
00:22:42,161 --> 00:22:44,061
(Rewinding)

532
00:22:44,096 --> 00:22:46,497
...message for me, tell me
what it is.

533
00:22:46,532 --> 00:22:49,466
(Faint ghostly whispers)

534
00:22:49,501 --> 00:22:50,768
(beeping)

535
00:22:50,803 --> 00:22:51,568


536
00:22:51,603 --> 00:22:54,505
(creaking)

537
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:55,906
Jesus!

538
00:22:55,941 --> 00:22:58,409
What's going on?

539
00:22:58,444 --> 00:23:01,078
A lot of shit, man.

540
00:23:01,113 --> 00:23:03,781


541
00:23:03,816 --> 00:23:05,416
Oh God.

542
00:23:05,451 --> 00:23:14,691


543
00:23:19,097 --> 00:23:20,097
Hey.

544
00:23:20,132 --> 00:23:21,498
Sorry.

545
00:23:21,533 --> 00:23:22,499
Oh God.

546
00:23:22,534 --> 00:23:24,067
What'd you see?

547
00:23:24,102 --> 00:23:25,469
Right through here.

548
00:23:25,504 --> 00:23:35,546


549
00:23:35,548 --> 00:23:45,923


550
00:23:45,958 --> 00:23:48,826
We saw a shadow of somebody
walk past, Mike.

551
00:23:48,861 --> 00:23:51,995


552
00:23:52,030 --> 00:23:55,065
- You scared? -Well, if it's a
ghost, then no,

553
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:56,733
but if it's an intruder with a
knife that's gonna

554
00:23:56,768 --> 00:23:58,735
tie me up and murder me, then
yes.

555
00:23:58,770 --> 00:24:00,137
I don't think it was an
intruder.

556
00:24:00,172 --> 00:24:01,905


557
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:04,174
This place is the real deal,
isn't it?

558
00:24:04,209 --> 00:24:18,856


559
00:24:18,891 --> 00:24:22,493
(static filled ghostly
whispers)

560
00:24:22,528 --> 00:24:23,961
Sounds like "fuck you."

561
00:24:23,996 --> 00:24:24,795
Yeah, I was gonna say the same
thing.

562
00:24:24,830 --> 00:24:26,797
That's what I heard.

563
00:24:26,832 --> 00:24:30,601
(Static filled ghostly
whispers)

564
00:24:30,636 --> 00:24:32,035
No, I'm hearing "they."

565
00:24:32,070 --> 00:24:33,170
"They fuck you."

566
00:24:33,205 --> 00:24:35,072
That's lovely.

567
00:24:35,107 --> 00:24:36,273
Play my EVP.

568
00:24:36,308 --> 00:24:40,811


569
00:24:40,846 --> 00:24:44,581
(static filled ghostly
whispers)

570
00:24:44,616 --> 00:24:46,717
I hear "go" and "idge."

571
00:24:46,752 --> 00:24:50,687
Play it again.

572
00:24:50,722 --> 00:24:52,923
(Static filled ghostly
whispers)

573
00:24:54,192 --> 00:24:55,259
Grids?

574
00:24:55,294 --> 00:24:57,094
Go to the ridge?

575
00:24:57,129 --> 00:24:58,595
Go to the fridge?

576
00:24:58,630 --> 00:25:00,163
Fridge? She's hungry?

577
00:25:00,198 --> 00:25:02,299
Maybe we should go make her a
sandwich.

578
00:25:02,334 --> 00:25:04,968
So what do you think?

579
00:25:05,003 --> 00:25:07,170
I think we might sell our
first show to a network.

580
00:25:07,205 --> 00:25:09,706


581
00:25:09,741 --> 00:25:11,174
I just felt a kick.

582
00:25:11,209 --> 00:25:12,776
- Let me feel! -I just felt a
kick!

583
00:25:12,811 --> 00:25:14,011
That's so exciting!

584
00:25:14,046 --> 00:25:15,112
Yeah.

585
00:25:15,147 --> 00:25:25,189


586
00:25:25,191 --> 00:25:35,165


587
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:37,601
Hey. You got another one of
those?

588
00:25:37,636 --> 00:25:39,269
I thought you quit.

589
00:25:39,304 --> 00:25:40,604
Live dangerously.

590
00:25:40,639 --> 00:25:47,344


591
00:25:47,379 --> 00:25:49,146
You all right?

592
00:25:49,181 --> 00:25:50,614
I'm not cut out for this shit,
man.

593
00:25:50,649 --> 00:25:52,149
I'm...

594
00:25:52,184 --> 00:25:54,251
I don't know how to deal with
it.

595
00:25:54,286 --> 00:25:57,054
It's "like father, like son,"
no matter how much I resist.

596
00:25:57,089 --> 00:26:03,860


597
00:26:03,895 --> 00:26:05,762
You and Maya are good though,
huh?

598
00:26:05,797 --> 00:26:07,230
Yeah, she thinks so.

599
00:26:07,265 --> 00:26:09,066
You don't?

600
00:26:09,101 --> 00:26:11,268
It's perfect, like, we don't
argue.

601
00:26:11,303 --> 00:26:13,203
No problems.

602
00:26:13,238 --> 00:26:15,305
That's the problem.

603
00:26:15,340 --> 00:26:17,074
We don't fight.

604
00:26:17,109 --> 00:26:18,275
We don't laugh.

605
00:26:18,310 --> 00:26:19,610
You don't fuck.

606
00:26:19,645 --> 00:26:21,278


607
00:26:21,313 --> 00:26:23,080
Yeah, man, I've been in that
relationship.

608
00:26:23,115 --> 00:26:25,682
You guys are more like brother
and sister.

609
00:26:25,717 --> 00:26:27,684
Exactly.

610
00:26:27,719 --> 00:26:30,187
Brother and sister?

611
00:26:30,222 --> 00:26:31,288
Hi...

612
00:26:31,323 --> 00:26:36,159


613
00:26:36,194 --> 00:26:37,327
Prick.

614
00:26:37,362 --> 00:26:40,163
Ask and you shall receive.

615
00:26:40,198 --> 00:26:41,765
Go get her, man.

616
00:26:45,037 --> 00:26:52,275


617
00:26:52,310 --> 00:26:53,844
This is video surveillance
footage

618
00:26:53,879 --> 00:26:55,646
from inside the bottle
factory.

619
00:26:55,681 --> 00:27:00,250


620
00:27:00,285 --> 00:27:02,919
Oh shit, that's spooky.

621
00:27:02,954 --> 00:27:05,155
Pay attention to the courtyard
shot.

622
00:27:05,190 --> 00:27:07,791


623
00:27:07,826 --> 00:27:09,660
Wait. Can you pause it a
second?

624
00:27:09,695 --> 00:27:10,794


625
00:27:10,829 --> 00:27:12,729
What year was this taken?

626
00:27:12,764 --> 00:27:14,765
'93.

627
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:16,667
And that's not your sister?

628
00:27:16,702 --> 00:27:19,102
She died a year before.

629
00:27:19,137 --> 00:27:19,836
It could have been a visitor,
right?

630
00:27:19,871 --> 00:27:22,205
You said the winery does
tours?

631
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:24,808
I think that girl is Beatrice
Blaine.

632
00:27:24,843 --> 00:27:27,044
The girl from the auger?

633
00:27:27,079 --> 00:27:28,211
Yeah.

634
00:27:28,246 --> 00:27:29,379
Creepy.

635
00:27:29,414 --> 00:27:32,349
Have you posted any of this on
the net?

636
00:27:32,384 --> 00:27:33,784
Jim might have.

637
00:27:33,819 --> 00:27:34,851
All he does is tweak out

638
00:27:34,886 --> 00:27:37,354
and post videos on YouTube.

639
00:27:37,389 --> 00:27:38,822
He's a tweaker?

640
00:27:38,857 --> 00:27:41,925
He's a total loser.

641
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:45,362
My dad, he lets him park his
trailer on our land.

642
00:27:45,397 --> 00:27:46,863
I don't know why.

643
00:27:46,898 --> 00:27:48,699
He should cut him off,

644
00:27:48,734 --> 00:27:51,368
but now that he's sick, he
won't.

645
00:27:51,403 --> 00:27:54,071


646
00:27:54,106 --> 00:27:57,174
He thinks he's gonna run this
place with me.

647
00:27:57,209 --> 00:27:59,142
It's not gonna happen.

648
00:27:59,177 --> 00:28:01,278
Would you like to join us,
Dax?

649
00:28:01,313 --> 00:28:02,846
What are you doing back there?

650
00:28:02,881 --> 00:28:05,282
I'm just watching the footage.

651
00:28:05,317 --> 00:28:06,817
What is your problem?

652
00:28:06,852 --> 00:28:08,452
Why do I have to have a
problem?

653
00:28:08,487 --> 00:28:10,220
We have 48 hours to do this,
right?

654
00:28:10,255 --> 00:28:11,855
Whoa.

655
00:28:11,890 --> 00:28:13,790
Definite overanalyzing. I'm
just sitting back.

656
00:28:13,825 --> 00:28:15,759
I don't like to sit close to
the screen.

657
00:28:15,794 --> 00:28:17,094
- I'm sorry. -Should we do this
another time?

658
00:28:17,129 --> 00:28:19,296
- No, please. -No, please give
us a second.

659
00:28:19,331 --> 00:28:21,031
- Let's just watch. No. -You
don't direct everything,

660
00:28:21,066 --> 00:28:22,232
Theresa, thank you.

661
00:28:22,267 --> 00:28:23,934


662
00:28:25,070 --> 00:28:25,936
I'm sorry.

663
00:28:25,971 --> 00:28:26,937
Thank you.

664
00:28:30,142 --> 00:28:42,452


665
00:28:42,487 --> 00:28:45,055
(otherworldly vibration)

666
00:28:45,090 --> 00:28:48,325


667
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:50,026
You wanna see something
disgusting?

668
00:28:50,061 --> 00:28:53,764
I think that's a
three-week-old cookie.

669
00:28:53,799 --> 00:28:55,232
- Want some? -No.

670
00:28:55,267 --> 00:28:57,234
No? You're full?

671
00:28:57,269 --> 00:28:59,402
How long have those cookies
even been in there?

672
00:28:59,437 --> 00:29:00,270
I don't know.

673
00:29:00,305 --> 00:29:02,005
A really long time.

674
00:29:04,543 --> 00:29:07,210
Do you think that, um, Ashen
likes me?

675
00:29:07,245 --> 00:29:08,311


676
00:29:08,346 --> 00:29:10,447
(exhales)

677
00:29:10,482 --> 00:29:13,850
I don't think that you want to
know what I think about that.

678
00:29:13,885 --> 00:29:16,820
Why don't you try dating
someone that gets you?

679
00:29:16,855 --> 00:29:18,488
Someone that gets me?

680
00:29:18,523 --> 00:29:21,158
You know, instead of these
jerks

681
00:29:21,193 --> 00:29:22,359
that just use you

682
00:29:22,394 --> 00:29:24,995
and then spit you out?

683
00:29:25,030 --> 00:29:27,798
Come on, we have been friends
for so long.

684
00:29:27,833 --> 00:29:29,232
I don't wanna ruin that.

685
00:29:29,267 --> 00:29:30,934
Yeah...

686
00:29:30,969 --> 00:29:32,869


687
00:29:32,904 --> 00:29:34,337
(slams)

688
00:29:34,372 --> 00:29:35,906
Look me in the eyes and tell
me right now

689
00:29:35,941 --> 00:29:37,574
that you've not been with
anybody else.

690
00:29:37,609 --> 00:29:39,943
I never cheated on you, Dax,
all right?

691
00:29:39,978 --> 00:29:41,244
- I didn't. -Why? Because we
were broken up?

692
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:43,046
I swear on this baby's life

693
00:29:43,081 --> 00:29:44,114
that you're the father.

694
00:29:44,149 --> 00:29:46,082
- Here we go again. -What do
you want?

695
00:29:46,117 --> 00:29:48,151
You want a relationship like
Dax and Theresa?

696
00:29:48,186 --> 00:29:51,521
You're venting to somebody
about our problems.

697
00:29:51,556 --> 00:29:52,389
Because you don't talk to me.

698
00:29:52,424 --> 00:29:53,456
Is it so wrong

699
00:29:53,491 --> 00:29:54,391
that I don't wanna fight?

700
00:29:54,426 --> 00:29:56,259
You respond to fights.

701
00:29:56,294 --> 00:29:58,195
We don't have to fight.

702
00:29:58,230 --> 00:29:59,563
(Meter vibrating)

703
00:29:59,598 --> 00:30:01,464
You just keep on dating your
rich father,

704
00:30:01,499 --> 00:30:04,067
who abused you.

705
00:30:04,102 --> 00:30:04,968
Excuse me?

706
00:30:05,003 --> 00:30:06,503
Do you remember that night

707
00:30:06,538 --> 00:30:08,872
when you were walking down the
street

708
00:30:08,907 --> 00:30:11,107
with this crazed look on your
face?

709
00:30:11,142 --> 00:30:16,179


710
00:30:16,214 --> 00:30:19,082
How dare you bring that up?
How dare you?

711
00:30:19,117 --> 00:30:20,617
Do you remember what we said
to each other that night?

712
00:30:20,652 --> 00:30:22,118
You can't just talk about that
shit.

713
00:30:22,153 --> 00:30:24,154
You can't just bring that shit
up.

714
00:30:24,189 --> 00:30:25,589
You're always looking to
someone else.

715
00:30:25,624 --> 00:30:27,390
(Overlapping arguing)

716
00:30:27,425 --> 00:30:30,627
You want that negative attention,
and I'm catching you.

717
00:30:30,662 --> 00:30:32,229
That's what this is about? You
catching me?

718
00:30:32,264 --> 00:30:34,865
(Overlapping arguing)

719
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:36,299
Things would be a little more
cut and dry...

720
00:30:36,334 --> 00:30:38,235
Tell me the truth. You don't
know how I would react.

721
00:30:38,270 --> 00:30:40,070
Dax, we came up here to
location scout.

722
00:30:40,105 --> 00:30:42,138
That's the only time it
could've happened.

723
00:30:42,173 --> 00:30:44,107
- Stop. -Don't fucking ask me
that.

724
00:30:44,142 --> 00:30:45,508
Stop it right now.

725
00:30:45,543 --> 00:30:46,343
I'm not trying to fucking hurt
you.

726
00:30:46,378 --> 00:30:47,911
I'm not the one tr

727
00:30:47,946 --> 00:30:48,945
Don't you ever talk about that
again.

728
00:30:48,980 --> 00:30:50,480
You promised you would never.

729
00:30:50,515 --> 00:30:52,148
Out of the seven people that
are here

730
00:30:52,183 --> 00:30:54,017
out of the seven people that
are here,

731
00:30:54,052 --> 00:30:55,518
who have you told about your
cousin

732
00:30:55,553 --> 00:30:56,987
blowing his head off with your
gun?

733
00:30:57,022 --> 00:30:59,055
Because I guarantee you told
someone.

734
00:30:59,090 --> 00:31:01,524


735
00:31:01,559 --> 00:31:02,626
No! (Gunshot)

736
00:31:02,661 --> 00:31:04,160
But the fact that we don't
fight

737
00:31:04,195 --> 00:31:05,295
and the fact that we don't
talk

738
00:31:05,330 --> 00:31:08,131
about our messed up past
bothers you.

739
00:31:08,166 --> 00:31:10,100
I tried, I said I'd come to
you, I say,

740
00:31:10,135 --> 00:31:12,502
but "No, I'm too busy, I have
to focus on work."

741
00:31:12,537 --> 00:31:15,672
Dax, I know, I know I tend to
get consumed with my job

742
00:31:15,707 --> 00:31:18,241
and with my goals and the things I want to accomplish in life

743
00:31:18,276 --> 00:31:20,610
but I'm not gonna stop doing
the things I want to do in life

744
00:31:20,645 --> 00:31:22,245
because you feel threatened.

745
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:24,648
(Overlapping arguing)

746
00:31:24,683 --> 00:31:29,152


747
00:31:29,187 --> 00:31:30,587
Fuck you, Jason, you know?
Fuck you.

748
00:31:30,622 --> 00:31:31,621
Why the fuck are you even
talking to me?

749
00:31:31,656 --> 00:31:32,689
Don't fucking talk to me.

750
00:31:32,724 --> 00:31:33,690
Are you fucking kidding me?

751
00:31:33,725 --> 00:31:34,658
Maya.

752
00:31:34,693 --> 00:31:35,625
Maya!

753
00:31:35,660 --> 00:31:37,560
Get your ass back here!

754
00:31:37,595 --> 00:31:39,496
The baby is yours Dax, okay?

755
00:31:39,531 --> 00:31:41,298
We need to calm down.

756
00:31:41,333 --> 00:31:51,375


757
00:31:51,377 --> 00:31:58,381


758
00:31:58,416 --> 00:31:59,482
(grunting)

759
00:31:59,517 --> 00:32:01,484
I'm sorry.

760
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:03,420
I'm sorry.

761
00:32:03,455 --> 00:32:05,221
And I'm going to do everything
in my power

762
00:32:05,256 --> 00:32:09,125
to make sure you stay calm
this weekend.

763
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:10,527
Just breathe.

764
00:32:10,562 --> 00:32:14,364


765
00:32:24,442 --> 00:32:28,111
Wine, wine, everywhere, nor
any drop to drink.

766
00:32:30,348 --> 00:32:32,482
Ah. Not bad.

767
00:32:32,517 --> 00:32:35,018
Don't get us in trouble, okay?

768
00:32:35,053 --> 00:32:37,420
I doubt they're gonna miss one
little bottle of wine.

769
00:32:40,525 --> 00:32:42,225
I'm gonna go check out the
bomb shelter.

770
00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:44,260
You go back to the old Till
house.

771
00:32:44,295 --> 00:32:45,595
Okay?

772
00:32:48,733 --> 00:32:50,567
You read my mind.

773
00:33:04,215 --> 00:33:06,049
(Panting)

774
00:33:06,084 --> 00:33:16,126


775
00:33:16,128 --> 00:33:25,502


776
00:33:25,537 --> 00:33:28,638
(panting)

777
00:33:28,673 --> 00:33:31,241
(clattering)

778
00:33:31,276 --> 00:33:37,313


779
00:33:37,348 --> 00:33:39,716
(pulling light switch)

780
00:33:39,751 --> 00:33:51,161


781
00:34:20,325 --> 00:34:30,367


782
00:34:30,369 --> 00:34:36,306


783
00:34:36,341 --> 00:34:37,540
Rory Devink.

784
00:34:42,213 --> 00:34:45,281
"This much time
underground..."

785
00:34:51,222 --> 00:34:52,755
Oh my God.

786
00:34:52,790 --> 00:34:54,324
(Glass shattering)

787
00:34:54,359 --> 00:34:56,192
Who's there?

788
00:35:12,544 --> 00:35:16,779
"Rachel knows how to make..."

789
00:35:16,814 --> 00:35:20,416


790
00:35:20,451 --> 00:35:22,819
(panting)

791
00:35:22,854 --> 00:35:26,523


792
00:35:26,558 --> 00:35:27,624
"They know..."

793
00:35:27,659 --> 00:35:31,761


794
00:35:31,796 --> 00:35:33,563
"Go away..."

795
00:35:33,598 --> 00:35:37,267
"Rachel knows how to make them
go away."

796
00:35:37,302 --> 00:35:41,704


797
00:35:41,739 --> 00:35:44,741
So I just found something
really, really cool.

798
00:35:44,776 --> 00:35:46,376
I had a good feeling about
this place

799
00:35:46,411 --> 00:35:48,745
and King's Ransom does not
disappoint.

800
00:35:48,780 --> 00:35:51,848
We've had positive EVPs,
dramatic temperature swings,

801
00:35:51,883 --> 00:35:55,585
EMFs that are all over the
place...

802
00:35:55,620 --> 00:35:58,855
There is something here.

803
00:35:58,890 --> 00:36:03,226
I looked around in Rory Devink's bomb shelter and I found this.

804
00:36:03,261 --> 00:36:04,961
It's her diary.

805
00:36:04,996 --> 00:36:07,497
It's mostly just incoherent,

806
00:36:07,532 --> 00:36:10,266
but look at this.

807
00:36:10,301 --> 00:36:11,968
"Rachel...

808
00:36:12,003 --> 00:36:14,938
knows how to make them go
away."

809
00:36:14,973 --> 00:36:17,907
What does that mean? Who are
"they," you know?

810
00:36:17,942 --> 00:36:20,543
Maybe there's something that
Ashen isn't telling us.

811
00:36:23,881 --> 00:36:27,217
Maybe there's something else
hidden in these videos.

812
00:36:27,252 --> 00:36:28,451
(Creaking)

813
00:36:33,358 --> 00:36:37,360
So this is the old Till house.

814
00:36:37,395 --> 00:36:40,430
It's off-limits to the family
for whatever reason.

815
00:36:44,302 --> 00:36:48,304
It's my belief that ghosts are
shy.

816
00:36:51,042 --> 00:36:54,877
And they like it when it's
dark.

817
00:36:54,912 --> 00:36:58,681
And they like it when you're
alone.

818
00:36:58,716 --> 00:37:02,685
And they like it when you're
scared.

819
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:04,721
We definitely have all three
of those things

820
00:37:04,756 --> 00:37:08,391
happening right now.

821
00:37:08,426 --> 00:37:09,926
(Exhales)

822
00:37:09,961 --> 00:37:13,296
This place definitely...

823
00:37:13,331 --> 00:37:14,697
gives me the creeps.

824
00:37:14,732 --> 00:37:17,533


825
00:37:17,568 --> 00:37:19,736
There's the old piano.

826
00:37:19,771 --> 00:37:22,338
Rachel?

827
00:37:22,373 --> 00:37:25,408
If you're here, play something
on the piano.

828
00:37:25,443 --> 00:37:26,376
I'll start you off.

829
00:37:26,411 --> 00:37:30,013
(Hits piano keys)

830
00:37:30,048 --> 00:37:33,016
(rustling)

831
00:37:33,051 --> 00:37:34,517
Okay, what was that?

832
00:37:34,552 --> 00:37:38,955


833
00:37:38,990 --> 00:37:42,925
Okay, I definitely heard a
noise.

834
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:46,863
Could have been a pinecone
coming off the roof...

835
00:37:46,898 --> 00:37:48,531
(clattering)

836
00:37:48,566 --> 00:37:49,866
Or not.

837
00:37:49,901 --> 00:37:51,901
(Clattering)

838
00:37:51,936 --> 00:37:56,472


839
00:37:56,507 --> 00:37:59,042
Okay, something just rolled
down the stairs.

840
00:37:59,077 --> 00:38:01,044
(Panting)

841
00:38:01,079 --> 00:38:03,946
What is that?

842
00:38:03,981 --> 00:38:06,649
What's...

843
00:38:06,684 --> 00:38:08,584
Oh my God, it's an eye.

844
00:38:08,619 --> 00:38:10,853
Okay, that's fucked up.

845
00:38:10,888 --> 00:38:13,423


846
00:38:13,458 --> 00:38:15,325
That fucking door is unlocked.

847
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:27,904


848
00:38:27,939 --> 00:38:29,939
Hello?

849
00:38:29,974 --> 00:38:35,678


850
00:38:41,753 --> 00:38:42,885
You all right?

851
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:46,022
Yeah.

852
00:38:46,057 --> 00:38:47,357
Is it me, or do you get the
sense that there's

853
00:38:47,392 --> 00:38:49,692
something up with Ashen?

854
00:38:49,727 --> 00:38:51,461
- Like what? -I dunno.

855
00:38:51,496 --> 00:38:53,096
It's like every time he talks
about his dead sister

856
00:38:53,131 --> 00:38:56,399
or his brother, he gets this
this weird look on his face.

857
00:38:56,434 --> 00:38:58,501
- I haven't really noticed it.
- I mean, think about it.

858
00:38:58,536 --> 00:39:00,503
What's this winery worth?

859
00:39:00,538 --> 00:39:02,605
I can't count that high.

860
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:04,707
With his sister dead, his
brother is the only thing

861
00:39:04,742 --> 00:39:08,111
standing in the way of him
inheriting this whole place.

862
00:39:08,146 --> 00:39:09,512
I mean, he hates his brother.

863
00:39:09,547 --> 00:39:11,047
You can hear it all over him.

864
00:39:11,082 --> 00:39:12,548
Well his brother's a drug
addict.

865
00:39:12,583 --> 00:39:14,050
Yeah, he's probably hoping he
ODs.

866
00:39:14,085 --> 00:39:15,518
You don't know that.

867
00:39:15,553 --> 00:39:18,421
He said his sister died in a
car accident.

868
00:39:18,456 --> 00:39:19,989
I wonder who was driving.

869
00:39:20,024 --> 00:39:26,429


870
00:39:31,502 --> 00:39:33,035
These fucking dolls.

871
00:39:33,070 --> 00:39:35,171
Who makes this shit?

872
00:39:35,206 --> 00:39:40,143


873
00:39:40,178 --> 00:39:42,445
There's writing all over this
wall.

874
00:39:46,551 --> 00:39:48,818
Not nice things.

875
00:39:50,121 --> 00:39:51,521
(Exhales)

876
00:39:57,829 --> 00:40:01,097
It's definitely not...

877
00:40:01,132 --> 00:40:03,900
a good feeling in here.

878
00:40:07,705 --> 00:40:09,505
What is this here?

879
00:40:12,877 --> 00:40:15,812
Not a bad artist.

880
00:40:15,847 --> 00:40:18,181
Vineyards...

881
00:40:18,216 --> 00:40:19,816
the Till house...

882
00:40:19,851 --> 00:40:23,085


883
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:24,587
Don't like that one.

884
00:40:24,622 --> 00:40:28,090


885
00:40:28,125 --> 00:40:31,060
Whoa, what is this?

886
00:40:31,095 --> 00:40:33,496


887
00:40:33,531 --> 00:40:35,198
This is your notebook?

888
00:40:35,233 --> 00:40:36,966


889
00:40:37,001 --> 00:40:38,000
(clicking)

890
00:40:38,035 --> 00:40:39,936
(otherworldly sounds)

891
00:40:39,971 --> 00:40:41,938
What the hell was that?

892
00:40:41,973 --> 00:40:44,574
(Panting)

893
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:56,586
Rebi?

894
00:40:56,621 --> 00:41:03,826


895
00:41:03,861 --> 00:41:06,596
(panting)

896
00:41:06,631 --> 00:41:07,897


897
00:41:07,932 --> 00:41:10,933
You've got to be kidding me.

898
00:41:10,968 --> 00:41:13,669
Looks like someone decapitated
a bunch of dolls

899
00:41:13,704 --> 00:41:15,771
and put them in a bathtub.

900
00:41:20,778 --> 00:41:22,211
Let's check out this room.

901
00:41:22,246 --> 00:41:29,252


902
00:41:29,287 --> 00:41:32,922
It's so cold in here.

903
00:41:32,957 --> 00:41:34,724
There's dust everywhere.

904
00:41:38,296 --> 00:41:39,595
What the fuck...

905
00:41:39,630 --> 00:41:42,899
Okay, that's a leg.

906
00:41:42,934 --> 00:41:43,966


907
00:41:44,001 --> 00:41:46,235
What is this?

908
00:41:46,270 --> 00:41:48,771
Peek-a-boo...

909
00:41:48,806 --> 00:41:50,907
(door slams)

910
00:41:50,942 --> 00:41:53,309
Okay.

911
00:41:53,344 --> 00:41:55,545
The door just moved.

912
00:41:55,580 --> 00:41:57,613
Did you do that?

913
00:41:57,648 --> 00:41:59,282
Did you do that?

914
00:41:59,317 --> 00:42:01,317
(Panting)

915
00:42:01,352 --> 00:42:03,119
Okay, who's screwing with me?

916
00:42:03,154 --> 00:42:04,720
(Running footsteps)

917
00:42:04,755 --> 00:42:05,922
Oh shit.

918
00:42:07,825 --> 00:42:10,626
(Shrieking)

919
00:42:12,163 --> 00:42:14,096
Oh, shit!

920
00:42:14,131 --> 00:42:15,698
What happened?

921
00:42:15,733 --> 00:42:17,900
(Screaming)

922
00:42:17,935 --> 00:42:19,902
Stop it!

923
00:42:19,937 --> 00:42:22,338
(Muffled screaming)

924
00:42:25,977 --> 00:42:27,610
Oh, shit!

925
00:42:27,645 --> 00:42:29,345
It's out there in the woods.

926
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:30,613
It's an entity.

927
00:42:30,648 --> 00:42:32,114
I can't really explain.

928
00:42:32,149 --> 00:42:33,616
It picked me up,

929
00:42:33,651 --> 00:42:35,751
literally picked me up off the
ground.

930
00:42:35,786 --> 00:42:37,653
It's strong, it's like

931
00:42:37,688 --> 00:42:41,123
Do you really think I killed
my sister?

932
00:42:41,158 --> 00:42:43,192
You know the next time you want to have a private conversation,

933
00:42:43,227 --> 00:42:45,828
try turning your headset off.

934
00:42:45,863 --> 00:42:46,796
I'm sorry, Ashen.

935
00:42:46,831 --> 00:42:48,064
I can get paranoid

936
00:42:48,099 --> 00:42:49,699
I didn't kill Rebi.

937
00:42:51,235 --> 00:42:53,603
I loved my sister.

938
00:42:53,638 --> 00:42:55,871
I love my brother, too.

939
00:42:55,906 --> 00:43:00,109
I have nightmares to this day
about that crash.

940
00:43:00,144 --> 00:43:01,210
That's the truth.

941
00:43:01,245 --> 00:43:04,213


942
00:43:04,248 --> 00:43:06,949
Do you know why you're here,
Theresa?

943
00:43:06,984 --> 00:43:09,318
To hunt for ghosts.

944
00:43:09,353 --> 00:43:10,853
To prove their existence.

945
00:43:10,888 --> 00:43:13,823
Not to me.

946
00:43:13,858 --> 00:43:17,293
So please...

947
00:43:17,328 --> 00:43:21,664
stay focused on what's
important.

948
00:43:21,699 --> 00:43:24,033
Okay.

949
00:43:24,068 --> 00:43:26,636
(Grunting)

950
00:43:26,671 --> 00:43:30,673


951
00:43:30,708 --> 00:43:32,775
Maybe we can fight a little.

952
00:43:32,810 --> 00:43:35,144
(Panting)

953
00:43:35,179 --> 00:43:44,987


954
00:43:45,022 --> 00:43:46,689
Whoa. You all right?

955
00:43:46,724 --> 00:43:47,390
You okay?

956
00:43:47,425 --> 00:43:50,092
What happened?

957
00:43:50,127 --> 00:43:52,061
- Baby? -No, I'm good.

958
00:43:52,096 --> 00:43:54,664
I'm just tired, I guess.

959
00:43:56,333 --> 00:43:57,033
(Beeping)

960
00:43:57,068 --> 00:43:59,035
Whoa.

961
00:43:59,070 --> 00:44:01,904
That's substantial.

962
00:44:01,939 --> 00:44:04,306
Check this out.

963
00:44:04,341 --> 00:44:05,408
Check the meter. See where it
is?

964
00:44:05,443 --> 00:44:07,743
- Mm-hm. -Watch this.

965
00:44:07,778 --> 00:44:09,078
(Beeping)

966
00:44:09,113 --> 00:44:10,880
It's weird. It's like this
room

967
00:44:10,915 --> 00:44:13,349
just, like, feels creepy.

968
00:44:13,384 --> 00:44:15,384
Somebody's becoming a
believer.

969
00:44:15,419 --> 00:44:16,419
No, I'm not saying that.

970
00:44:16,454 --> 00:44:18,954
It just feels weird.

971
00:44:18,989 --> 00:44:20,056
Look at these pictures.

972
00:44:20,091 --> 00:44:23,159
They're of the Till family.

973
00:44:23,194 --> 00:44:24,860
People always look funny from
these times.

974
00:44:24,895 --> 00:44:27,396
(Door creaking)

975
00:44:27,431 --> 00:44:29,365
You two look rosy.

976
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:31,867
- We went for a walk. -A walk?

977
00:44:31,902 --> 00:44:33,135
I don't want to see you after
a run then.

978
00:44:33,170 --> 00:44:35,304
What do you got?

979
00:44:35,339 --> 00:44:37,406
We got fluctuations up to
five.

980
00:44:37,441 --> 00:44:38,708
It's spiking.

981
00:44:38,743 --> 00:44:42,478


982
00:44:42,513 --> 00:44:44,046
Dax.

983
00:44:44,081 --> 00:44:46,849
Go back for a second to that
other picture.

984
00:44:46,884 --> 00:44:47,349
Which one?

985
00:44:47,384 --> 00:44:48,350
This one?

986
00:44:48,385 --> 00:44:49,351
No, no, no, no, no.

987
00:44:49,386 --> 00:44:50,886
No, no, no, the other one.

988
00:44:50,921 --> 00:44:53,055
The one of the room?

989
00:44:53,090 --> 00:44:56,092


990
00:44:56,127 --> 00:44:58,427
Look at this.

991
00:44:58,462 --> 00:44:59,929
This is the room we're in,
right?

992
00:44:59,964 --> 00:45:01,097
- Yeah. -Look.

993
00:45:01,132 --> 00:45:02,064
There's a door

994
00:45:02,099 --> 00:45:03,866
where that armoire is.

995
00:45:03,901 --> 00:45:05,334
No, that's the door we just
walked through.

996
00:45:05,369 --> 00:45:06,969
No, no, no. Look.

997
00:45:07,004 --> 00:45:08,337
If you look at the layout of
the furniture,

998
00:45:08,372 --> 00:45:11,807
it would put this door...

999
00:45:11,842 --> 00:45:13,342
right here.

1000
00:45:13,377 --> 00:45:15,511
This is where I'm getting the
strongest reading.

1001
00:45:15,546 --> 00:45:19,482
Is it okay if we move this?

1002
00:45:19,517 --> 00:45:21,083
Let's do it.

1003
00:45:21,118 --> 00:45:31,160


1004
00:45:31,162 --> 00:45:36,899


1005
00:45:42,206 --> 00:45:44,306
Wonder why it was covered up.

1006
00:45:44,341 --> 00:45:46,041
I have no idea.

1007
00:45:46,076 --> 00:45:48,844
It's been like that since I
was a kid.

1008
00:45:48,879 --> 00:45:50,913
I know that.

1009
00:45:50,948 --> 00:45:53,015
That's super creepy.

1010
00:45:53,050 --> 00:45:55,417
(Creaking)

1011
00:45:55,452 --> 00:45:58,053


1012
00:45:58,088 --> 00:45:59,021
Oh wow.

1013
00:45:59,056 --> 00:46:00,523
Oh my God.

1014
00:46:00,558 --> 00:46:02,825
Mike, do you have enough light
to get this?

1015
00:46:02,860 --> 00:46:04,260
Careful what you touch.

1016
00:46:04,295 --> 00:46:06,929
I'm not sure you should be
touching things.

1017
00:46:06,964 --> 00:46:09,799
Smells like dead rats in here.

1018
00:46:09,834 --> 00:46:11,534
Guys, this paint is still wet.

1019
00:46:11,569 --> 00:46:14,336


1020
00:46:14,371 --> 00:46:16,405
Look at these paintings, you
guys.

1021
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:19,074


1022
00:46:19,109 --> 00:46:20,376
Check out all this writing.

1023
00:46:20,411 --> 00:46:22,111
It comes all the way over here
too.

1024
00:46:22,146 --> 00:46:26,448


1025
00:46:26,483 --> 00:46:27,349
Bridge...

1026
00:46:27,384 --> 00:46:28,951
"Now I go

1027
00:46:28,986 --> 00:46:31,287
to the summer bridge..."

1028
00:46:31,322 --> 00:46:34,223
to meet the devil?

1029
00:46:34,258 --> 00:46:35,324
God.

1030
00:46:35,359 --> 00:46:36,058
Shit.

1031
00:46:36,093 --> 00:46:38,894
(Phone ringing)

1032
00:46:38,929 --> 00:46:40,563
Hello? Dad?

1033
00:46:40,598 --> 00:46:42,498
Dad, I'm gonna call you later
from a land line, okay?

1034
00:46:42,533 --> 00:46:43,365
Summer bridge...

1035
00:46:43,400 --> 00:46:44,333
Are you getting service?

1036
00:46:44,368 --> 00:46:45,534
Yeah, like one bar.

1037
00:46:45,569 --> 00:46:47,203
Guys. You guys, you guys.

1038
00:46:47,238 --> 00:46:48,604
The bridge.

1039
00:46:48,639 --> 00:46:50,139
That's what the EVP was
saying.

1040
00:46:50,174 --> 00:46:52,441
"Now I go to the bridge."

1041
00:46:52,476 --> 00:47:03,319


1042
00:47:03,354 --> 00:47:05,020
He shouldn't just be wandering
around,

1043
00:47:05,055 --> 00:47:06,989
especially now with us not
having any cell service.

1044
00:47:07,024 --> 00:47:08,624
- I'm sure he's close by. -I'm
sure he's close,

1045
00:47:08,659 --> 00:47:10,192
but we don't have time for
this.

1046
00:47:10,227 --> 00:47:12,361
We've got a tight schedule.

1047
00:47:12,396 --> 00:47:13,229
Speak of the devil.

1048
00:47:13,264 --> 00:47:16,098
Hey.

1049
00:47:16,133 --> 00:47:18,000
Hey!

1050
00:47:19,603 --> 00:47:20,436
Where the hell you been?

1051
00:47:20,471 --> 00:47:21,270
I went for a little walk

1052
00:47:21,305 --> 00:47:23,272
to clear my head.

1053
00:47:23,307 --> 00:47:25,307
What's goin' on?

1054
00:47:25,342 --> 00:47:26,442
Okay, well, nice of you to
join us.

1055
00:47:26,477 --> 00:47:27,409
Come on, we got a big lead.

1056
00:47:27,444 --> 00:47:29,111
Let's go.

1057
00:47:29,146 --> 00:47:30,246
This way.

1058
00:47:30,281 --> 00:47:31,380
Why doesn't Ashen ever have

1059
00:47:31,415 --> 00:47:33,148
to carry anything?

1060
00:47:33,183 --> 00:47:43,226


1061
00:47:43,228 --> 00:47:58,173


1062
00:47:58,208 --> 00:48:01,010
(soft conversations)

1063
00:48:05,582 --> 00:48:08,651
So what's the deal with this
bridge?

1064
00:48:08,686 --> 00:48:11,487
Rebi and I used to play here
when we were kids.

1065
00:48:11,522 --> 00:48:13,155
And this is where she died.

1066
00:48:13,190 --> 00:48:14,590
Careful, guys.

1067
00:48:14,625 --> 00:48:19,194
Can I ask you what exactly
happened?

1068
00:48:19,229 --> 00:48:21,463
When I found Rebi, she was
convulsing

1069
00:48:21,498 --> 00:48:23,532
and speaking in a language

1070
00:48:23,567 --> 00:48:26,535
that I didn't understand,
and...

1071
00:48:26,570 --> 00:48:29,371
I couldn't find anyone to help
me.

1072
00:48:29,406 --> 00:48:31,607
So I tried to drive her to the
hospital

1073
00:48:31,642 --> 00:48:34,510
but she forced us to crash.

1074
00:48:39,249 --> 00:48:42,117
She wasn't belted in and she
went face first

1075
00:48:42,152 --> 00:48:46,388
through the windshield.

1076
00:48:46,423 --> 00:48:49,291
You were driving?

1077
00:48:49,326 --> 00:48:51,627
Yeah.

1078
00:48:51,662 --> 00:48:53,062


1079
00:48:59,536 --> 00:49:01,103
- Whoa, whoa, whoa. -Don't do
that.

1080
00:49:01,138 --> 00:49:02,604
- That's not funny. -Chill out.

1081
00:49:02,639 --> 00:49:03,706
I was joking.

1082
00:49:03,741 --> 00:49:05,507
Jason's scared of the water.

1083
00:49:05,542 --> 00:49:08,310


1084
00:49:08,345 --> 00:49:10,179
Oh my God.

1085
00:49:10,214 --> 00:49:12,247
Oh my God, guys, look down
there.

1086
00:49:12,282 --> 00:49:14,016
There's someone down there.
There's a woman down there.

1087
00:49:14,051 --> 00:49:15,084
All right, guys, stay here.
Mike, come on.

1088
00:49:15,119 --> 00:49:15,684
Let's go, let's go.

1089
00:49:15,719 --> 00:49:19,555


1090
00:49:19,590 --> 00:49:21,623
- Hello? -Getting anything,
Mike?

1091
00:49:21,658 --> 00:49:22,725
I can't see anything down
here.

1092
00:49:22,760 --> 00:49:24,560
Where did she see her?

1093
00:49:24,595 --> 00:49:26,729
Somewhere around here.

1094
00:49:26,764 --> 00:49:28,364
This is the spot right here.

1095
00:49:28,399 --> 00:49:29,465
Anyone there?

1096
00:49:29,500 --> 00:49:31,767
(Slow beeping)

1097
00:49:31,802 --> 00:49:34,370
Anything?

1098
00:49:34,405 --> 00:49:37,706
(Screaming)

1099
00:49:37,741 --> 00:49:39,141
Maya?

1100
00:49:39,176 --> 00:49:39,742
Maya!

1101
00:49:39,777 --> 00:49:41,110
Sarah?

1102
00:49:41,145 --> 00:49:42,277
Sarah?

1103
00:49:42,312 --> 00:49:43,245
Sarah?

1104
00:49:43,280 --> 00:49:45,080
Sarah!

1105
00:49:45,115 --> 00:49:46,382
(Screaming)

1106
00:49:46,417 --> 00:49:48,150
Sarah!

1107
00:49:48,185 --> 00:49:50,352
- Hey hey, what do we got?
- Sarah's down there?

1108
00:49:50,387 --> 00:49:51,487
- How? -He pushed her.

1109
00:49:51,522 --> 00:49:53,155
He pushed her in!

1110
00:49:53,190 --> 00:49:55,057
What the hell is wrong with
you, man?

1111
00:49:55,092 --> 00:49:56,492
She was gonna jump. I tried to
grab her.

1112
00:49:56,527 --> 00:49:58,260
Bullshit. I saw you.

1113
00:49:58,295 --> 00:49:59,361
I did not! She was gonna jump!

1114
00:49:59,396 --> 00:50:00,429
You're such a fucking liar.

1115
00:50:00,464 --> 00:50:01,530
You pushed her in.

1116
00:50:01,565 --> 00:50:02,631
The current is strong.

1117
00:50:02,666 --> 00:50:03,399
We've got to get down there.

1118
00:50:03,434 --> 00:50:04,500
Let's go.

1119
00:50:04,535 --> 00:50:13,075


1120
00:50:13,110 --> 00:50:15,477
(all shouting for Sarah)

1121
00:50:15,512 --> 00:50:17,413
She should be here. It seems
shallow.

1122
00:50:17,448 --> 00:50:18,580
Somebody needs to go back to
the winery

1123
00:50:18,615 --> 00:50:19,681
and call the fucking police.

1124
00:50:19,716 --> 00:50:20,382
I'll go.

1125
00:50:20,417 --> 00:50:21,250
Take the girls.

1126
00:50:21,285 --> 00:50:22,518
Grab the equipment.

1127
00:50:22,553 --> 00:50:23,519
Let's keep looking.

1128
00:50:23,554 --> 00:50:31,260


1129
00:50:32,362 --> 00:50:35,064
Come on, come on, come on!

1130
00:50:35,099 --> 00:50:37,466
(Engine starting)

1131
00:50:37,501 --> 00:50:47,543


1132
00:50:47,545 --> 00:50:59,621


1133
00:50:59,656 --> 00:51:01,090
What?

1134
00:51:01,125 --> 00:51:03,859
I can't get an outside line.

1135
00:51:03,894 --> 00:51:04,827
All right, we'll go to town.

1136
00:51:04,862 --> 00:51:06,228
Come on.

1137
00:51:06,263 --> 00:51:11,467


1138
00:51:11,502 --> 00:51:12,568
Fuck.

1139
00:51:12,603 --> 00:51:16,405


1140
00:51:16,440 --> 00:51:17,339
Go inside.

1141
00:51:17,374 --> 00:51:18,740
I'll fix it.

1142
00:51:18,775 --> 00:51:19,441
Wait, why?

1143
00:51:19,476 --> 00:51:20,742
Go inside.

1144
00:51:20,777 --> 00:51:28,217


1145
00:51:35,192 --> 00:51:37,759
I really think that tire was
slashed.

1146
00:51:37,794 --> 00:51:40,462


1147
00:51:40,497 --> 00:51:42,131
No!

1148
00:51:49,606 --> 00:51:50,772
What's wrong? Are you okay?

1149
00:51:50,807 --> 00:51:53,208
Yeah, I'm fine.

1150
00:51:53,243 --> 00:51:56,578
All this stress isn't good for
the baby, that's all.

1151
00:51:56,613 --> 00:51:59,214
(Creaking)

1152
00:52:10,661 --> 00:52:13,295
I don't like this. I'm
checking on Mike.

1153
00:52:13,330 --> 00:52:15,898
(Panting)

1154
00:52:21,371 --> 00:52:22,437
Mike?

1155
00:52:22,472 --> 00:52:26,708


1156
00:52:26,743 --> 00:52:29,211
Mike!

1157
00:52:29,246 --> 00:52:31,613
Nobody gets out of here. Pull
the trigger.

1158
00:52:31,648 --> 00:52:33,615
- We're all gonna die. -Pull
the trigger.

1159
00:52:33,650 --> 00:52:34,716
Do it!

1160
00:52:34,751 --> 00:52:36,351
(Gunshot)

1161
00:52:36,386 --> 00:52:38,554
- Mike! -Oh my God.

1162
00:52:38,589 --> 00:52:40,389


1163
00:52:40,424 --> 00:52:42,858
Mike, Mike!

1164
00:52:42,893 --> 00:52:44,193
(Choking)

1165
00:52:44,228 --> 00:52:45,627
I get reception in the cellar.

1166
00:52:45,662 --> 00:52:48,363
We can go down there.

1167
00:52:48,398 --> 00:52:49,464
Mike, look at me.

1168
00:52:49,499 --> 00:52:51,833
Mike. Mike.

1169
00:52:51,868 --> 00:52:53,268
(Panting)

1170
00:52:53,303 --> 00:52:55,704
(phone ringing)

1171
00:52:58,242 --> 00:53:00,609
(gurgling)

1172
00:53:00,644 --> 00:53:03,312


1173
00:53:03,347 --> 00:53:05,714
(hyperventilating)

1174
00:53:05,749 --> 00:53:09,518


1175
00:53:09,553 --> 00:53:10,986
Maya?

1176
00:53:13,690 --> 00:53:17,226


1177
00:53:21,031 --> 00:53:23,632
(phone ringing)

1178
00:53:34,044 --> 00:53:36,612
(phone ringing louder)

1179
00:53:36,647 --> 00:53:43,986


1180
00:53:45,555 --> 00:53:46,488
Maya?

1181
00:53:46,523 --> 00:53:49,324
(Phone ringing)

1182
00:53:56,566 --> 00:54:01,436


1183
00:54:01,471 --> 00:54:04,273
(otherworldly sounds)

1184
00:54:06,009 --> 00:54:07,376
(gasps)

1185
00:54:07,411 --> 00:54:09,845


1186
00:54:09,880 --> 00:54:11,546
(shrieking)

1187
00:54:11,581 --> 00:54:12,914


1188
00:54:12,949 --> 00:54:14,516
(grunting)

1189
00:54:14,551 --> 00:54:16,618


1190
00:54:16,653 --> 00:54:19,054
(screaming)

1191
00:54:26,663 --> 00:54:32,534


1192
00:54:32,569 --> 00:54:35,337
(stabbing continues)

1193
00:54:40,610 --> 00:54:44,780


1194
00:54:44,815 --> 00:54:46,515
Maya?

1195
00:54:46,550 --> 00:55:00,529


1196
00:55:00,564 --> 00:55:01,797
Maya?

1197
00:55:01,832 --> 00:55:05,534


1198
00:55:05,569 --> 00:55:06,935
Maya?

1199
00:55:06,970 --> 00:55:10,105


1200
00:55:10,140 --> 00:55:13,108
They genetically bred out
fear.

1201
00:55:13,143 --> 00:55:16,078
Who are you talking to?

1202
00:55:16,113 --> 00:55:17,979
Theresa.

1203
00:55:18,014 --> 00:55:20,916
I'm talking to you.

1204
00:55:20,951 --> 00:55:30,993


1205
00:55:30,995 --> 00:55:40,569


1206
00:55:41,772 --> 00:55:52,047


1207
00:55:52,082 --> 00:55:54,015
(creaking)

1208
00:55:54,050 --> 00:55:56,718
(crickets chirping)

1209
00:55:56,753 --> 00:56:01,123


1210
00:56:01,158 --> 00:56:02,591
(panting)

1211
00:56:02,626 --> 00:56:08,797


1212
00:56:08,832 --> 00:56:09,531
Sarah?

1213
00:56:09,566 --> 00:56:12,000
Sarah?

1214
00:56:12,035 --> 00:56:14,703
This is impossible.

1215
00:56:14,738 --> 00:56:17,873
Sarah!

1216
00:56:17,908 --> 00:56:19,007
I didn't push her in.

1217
00:56:19,042 --> 00:56:21,143
Why would I fucking push her
in?

1218
00:56:21,178 --> 00:56:22,043
- Why would I do that? -Why
would she jump?

1219
00:56:22,078 --> 00:56:23,578
I don't know, man.

1220
00:56:23,613 --> 00:56:24,746
- Why would she jump? -I don't
know!

1221
00:56:24,781 --> 00:56:25,881
Let's not lose our heads,
okay?

1222
00:56:25,916 --> 00:56:27,482
I swear to God, man.

1223
00:56:27,517 --> 00:56:28,150
I swear to fucking God I
didn't push her in.

1224
00:56:28,185 --> 00:56:29,484
Let's find Sarah.

1225
00:56:29,519 --> 00:56:31,186
We'll ask her what happened.

1226
00:56:31,221 --> 00:56:32,687
Can anyone hear me?

1227
00:56:32,722 --> 00:56:34,189
You getting that?

1228
00:56:34,224 --> 00:56:35,457
Sarah.

1229
00:56:35,492 --> 00:56:36,591
Can you hear me?

1230
00:56:36,626 --> 00:56:38,126
Hello?

1231
00:56:38,161 --> 00:56:38,860
Can you hear me?

1232
00:56:38,895 --> 00:56:39,761
Is anyone there?

1233
00:56:39,796 --> 00:56:40,729
I can hear you.

1234
00:56:40,764 --> 00:56:41,696
Can you hear me?

1235
00:56:41,731 --> 00:56:43,465
Barely.

1236
00:56:43,500 --> 00:56:45,066
I'm at this road and I see
wooden shacks.

1237
00:56:45,101 --> 00:56:47,803
Wooden shacks? She must be
back at the winery.

1238
00:56:47,838 --> 00:56:49,171
Sarah, listen. Stay where you
are.

1239
00:56:49,206 --> 00:56:51,873
We're coming for you.

1240
00:56:51,908 --> 00:56:54,176
Sarah, can you hear me?

1241
00:56:54,211 --> 00:56:54,776
Why aren't we getting
reception?

1242
00:56:54,812 --> 00:56:56,545
Because her radio's wet.

1243
00:56:56,580 --> 00:56:57,579
We're lucky we're getting
anything at all.

1244
00:56:57,614 --> 00:56:58,713
I'm gonna go look for her.

1245
00:56:58,748 --> 00:57:00,081
Go. I'm coming with you.

1246
00:57:00,116 --> 00:57:01,516
Listen, you stay here in case

1247
00:57:01,551 --> 00:57:02,918
she comes around, all right?

1248
00:57:02,953 --> 00:57:03,919
You stay in contact.

1249
00:57:03,954 --> 00:57:05,620
You stay in contact.

1250
00:57:05,655 --> 00:57:06,121
Do you understand me?

1251
00:57:06,156 --> 00:57:07,622
Yeah.

1252
00:57:07,657 --> 00:57:16,565


1253
00:57:16,600 --> 00:57:21,503
There's definitely something
evil here.

1254
00:57:21,538 --> 00:57:24,105
The phone lines were cut

1255
00:57:24,140 --> 00:57:27,642
and our tires were slashed.

1256
00:57:27,677 --> 00:57:30,812
Maya's missing...

1257
00:57:30,847 --> 00:57:32,514
Mike...

1258
00:57:39,289 --> 00:57:44,226
There's only one person who
knows what's going on here.

1259
00:57:49,566 --> 00:57:51,666
I'm gonna find Jim Till.

1260
00:57:59,743 --> 00:58:00,842
Hello?

1261
00:58:02,312 --> 00:58:05,814
Hello?

1262
00:58:05,849 --> 00:58:06,915
Is anybody here?

1263
00:58:06,950 --> 00:58:07,983
(Knocking)

1264
00:58:08,018 --> 00:58:09,584
Hello?

1265
00:58:14,157 --> 00:58:15,757
Jim?

1266
00:58:20,163 --> 00:58:21,763
Hello?

1267
00:58:25,135 --> 00:58:26,535
(Sighs)

1268
00:58:29,239 --> 00:58:30,705
Oh my God.

1269
00:58:30,740 --> 00:58:39,981


1270
00:58:40,016 --> 00:58:41,883
That's disgusting.

1271
00:58:41,918 --> 00:58:44,953


1272
00:58:44,988 --> 00:58:46,154
Orbs...

1273
00:58:46,189 --> 00:58:54,296


1274
00:58:54,331 --> 00:58:57,032
They bred out fear.

1275
00:58:57,067 --> 00:58:59,734
Man's been enslaved by these
demonic forces.

1276
00:58:59,769 --> 00:59:00,969
They're able to navigate
between

1277
00:59:01,004 --> 00:59:02,571
the physical and the astral
plane.

1278
00:59:02,606 --> 00:59:03,605
They're technologically

1279
00:59:03,640 --> 00:59:04,773
and physically superior to us.

1280
00:59:04,808 --> 00:59:06,041
Religion calls them demons.

1281
00:59:06,076 --> 00:59:08,143
Ufologists call them
multidimensional beings.

1282
00:59:08,178 --> 00:59:09,744
What's relevant is they're
trying to assimilate us

1283
00:59:09,779 --> 00:59:11,112
into their fascist empire run!

1284
00:59:11,147 --> 00:59:12,581
And parasitically deplete us
of our physical

1285
00:59:12,616 --> 00:59:14,115
and biological resources.

1286
00:59:14,150 --> 00:59:15,884
They've been exploiting
mankind for thousands of years

1287
00:59:15,919 --> 00:59:17,619
you listen to me! Carefully
manifesting

1288
00:59:17,654 --> 00:59:19,988
this abduction hybrid breeding
program.

1289
00:59:20,023 --> 00:59:21,289
And they want to be portrayed
as saviors

1290
00:59:21,324 --> 00:59:22,757
while mankind goes mad...

1291
00:59:22,792 --> 00:59:24,292
Listen to me!

1292
00:59:24,327 --> 00:59:26,828
Listen. To. Me.

1293
00:59:26,863 --> 00:59:31,132
You're not fucking listening
to me.

1294
00:59:31,167 --> 00:59:32,767
Listen to me!

1295
00:59:32,802 --> 00:59:35,604
(Video continues to play)

1296
00:59:38,274 --> 00:59:41,610


1297
00:59:41,645 --> 00:59:44,212
(video continues to play)

1298
00:59:44,247 --> 00:59:52,053


1299
00:59:55,191 --> 00:59:57,058


1300
00:59:57,093 --> 00:59:59,260
(radio static)

1301
00:59:59,295 --> 01:00:03,031


1302
01:00:03,066 --> 01:00:03,932
Hey Dax?

1303
01:00:03,967 --> 01:00:04,466
Mike?

1304
01:00:04,501 --> 01:00:07,035
Can you guys hear me?

1305
01:00:07,070 --> 01:00:08,703
I can't stay here by myself.

1306
01:00:08,738 --> 01:00:11,139
I'm going insane.

1307
01:00:11,174 --> 01:00:14,075
I'm gonna go back to the
winery and look for her.

1308
01:00:14,110 --> 01:00:15,944
Sarah?

1309
01:00:15,979 --> 01:00:17,045
Sarah?

1310
01:00:17,080 --> 01:00:27,088


1311
01:00:28,291 --> 01:00:33,261


1312
01:00:33,296 --> 01:00:35,296
Sarah?

1313
01:00:35,331 --> 01:00:36,731
Oh my God.

1314
01:00:36,766 --> 01:00:39,367
Oh my God. Are you okay?

1315
01:00:39,402 --> 01:00:41,136
Where have you been?

1316
01:00:41,171 --> 01:00:42,337
Here. Put this on.

1317
01:00:42,372 --> 01:00:45,340
Put this on.

1318
01:00:45,375 --> 01:00:48,109
You're freezing.

1319
01:00:48,144 --> 01:00:49,678
What happened?

1320
01:00:49,713 --> 01:00:50,779
What happened? Look at me.

1321
01:00:50,814 --> 01:00:51,980
- Sarah. -They're beautiful.

1322
01:00:52,015 --> 01:00:54,115
Sarah, look at me. Look at me.

1323
01:00:54,150 --> 01:00:55,850
Okay, we gotta go this way,
all right?

1324
01:00:55,885 --> 01:00:57,318
- We're gonna go this way. -No.

1325
01:00:57,353 --> 01:00:58,353
Come with me. Sarah?

1326
01:00:58,388 --> 01:00:59,120
- Come. -No!

1327
01:00:59,155 --> 01:01:00,255
Sarah, come on!

1328
01:01:00,290 --> 01:01:01,456
Sarah!

1329
01:01:01,491 --> 01:01:02,957
Sarah.

1330
01:01:02,992 --> 01:01:06,327


1331
01:01:06,362 --> 01:01:08,163
Sarah.

1332
01:01:08,198 --> 01:01:12,000


1333
01:01:12,035 --> 01:01:13,101
Sarah.

1334
01:01:13,136 --> 01:01:15,837


1335
01:01:15,872 --> 01:01:16,471
Sarah, we're at the shack.

1336
01:01:16,506 --> 01:01:18,273
Come outside.

1337
01:01:18,308 --> 01:01:19,474
Sarah, do you read me?

1338
01:01:19,509 --> 01:01:22,877
Where is she?

1339
01:01:22,912 --> 01:01:25,146
Is there any other place she
could be?

1340
01:01:25,181 --> 01:01:26,247
I don't know.

1341
01:01:26,282 --> 01:01:31,352


1342
01:01:31,387 --> 01:01:33,254
- These the only wooden shacks?
- Shh, shh, shh, shh.

1343
01:01:33,289 --> 01:01:34,322
What?

1344
01:01:34,357 --> 01:01:35,390
Did you just hear that?

1345
01:01:35,425 --> 01:01:39,194


1346
01:01:39,229 --> 01:01:40,161
Sarah?

1347
01:01:43,800 --> 01:01:44,332
Now what?

1348
01:01:44,367 --> 01:01:45,300
Where?

1349
01:01:45,335 --> 01:01:47,902
(Rustling)

1350
01:01:47,937 --> 01:01:49,404
It's nothing. Let's go.

1351
01:01:49,439 --> 01:01:51,206
All right.

1352
01:01:51,241 --> 01:01:53,274
Sarah?

1353
01:01:53,309 --> 01:01:55,110
Sarah?

1354
01:01:55,145 --> 01:01:58,046


1355
01:01:58,081 --> 01:02:00,048
Sarah.

1356
01:02:00,083 --> 01:02:01,382
We've been looking all over
for you.

1357
01:02:01,417 --> 01:02:06,387


1358
01:02:06,422 --> 01:02:07,489
Sarah.

1359
01:02:07,524 --> 01:02:11,259


1360
01:02:11,294 --> 01:02:13,128
You pushed me.

1361
01:02:13,163 --> 01:02:14,162
Sarah. No.

1362
01:02:14,197 --> 01:02:16,097
You pushed me off the bridge.

1363
01:02:16,132 --> 01:02:17,766
You fell. I tried to save you.

1364
01:02:17,801 --> 01:02:19,400
No, you tried to kill me!

1365
01:02:19,435 --> 01:02:20,769
You tried to kill me!

1366
01:02:20,804 --> 01:02:23,238
Sarah, I would never hurt you.

1367
01:02:23,273 --> 01:02:34,182


1368
01:02:34,217 --> 01:02:35,984
Sarah, I...

1369
01:02:36,019 --> 01:02:38,386
Why would I ever want to hurt
you?

1370
01:02:38,421 --> 01:02:41,089


1371
01:02:41,124 --> 01:02:44,459
I'm in love with you.

1372
01:02:44,494 --> 01:02:47,061
(Screaming)

1373
01:02:47,096 --> 01:02:57,139


1374
01:02:57,141 --> 01:03:09,384


1375
01:03:09,419 --> 01:03:10,385
Jason?

1376
01:03:10,420 --> 01:03:18,426


1377
01:03:18,461 --> 01:03:19,861
(sobbing)

1378
01:03:22,599 --> 01:03:36,177


1379
01:03:36,212 --> 01:03:37,545
Hello?

1380
01:03:37,580 --> 01:03:40,481
(Faint ghostly voices)

1381
01:03:40,516 --> 01:03:42,617
Who's there?

1382
01:03:42,652 --> 01:03:45,954
(Faint ghostly voices)

1383
01:03:45,989 --> 01:03:48,356
- Beatrice? -They are too real.

1384
01:03:48,391 --> 01:03:51,359


1385
01:03:51,394 --> 01:03:52,227
Hello?

1386
01:03:52,262 --> 01:03:53,595
Fine.

1387
01:03:53,630 --> 01:03:55,430
Don't believe me.

1388
01:03:55,465 --> 01:03:59,300


1389
01:03:59,335 --> 01:04:02,537
They make you see things you
don't wanna see.

1390
01:04:02,572 --> 01:04:04,172
(Loud clattering)

1391
01:04:04,207 --> 01:04:07,442
They make you do things that
you don't wanna do.

1392
01:04:07,477 --> 01:04:10,945
Beatrice? What'd I say about
your imaginary friend?

1393
01:04:10,980 --> 01:04:12,213
She's real.

1394
01:04:12,248 --> 01:04:15,583
What the hell did you do?

1395
01:04:15,618 --> 01:04:16,885
What I had to.

1396
01:04:16,920 --> 01:04:17,886
What the hell did you do?!

1397
01:04:17,921 --> 01:04:19,087
Talk to Rachel.

1398
01:04:19,122 --> 01:04:20,555
She knows how to make them go
away.

1399
01:04:20,590 --> 01:04:22,156
Jesus Christ!

1400
01:04:22,191 --> 01:04:23,424
Daddy!

1401
01:04:23,459 --> 01:04:26,227
(Screaming)

1402
01:04:26,262 --> 01:04:29,564


1403
01:04:29,599 --> 01:04:31,900
(shouting)

1404
01:04:31,935 --> 01:04:34,335
(screaming)

1405
01:04:36,439 --> 01:04:46,481


1406
01:04:46,483 --> 01:04:52,520


1407
01:04:52,555 --> 01:04:53,955
(slam)

1408
01:04:56,259 --> 01:04:57,225


1409
01:04:57,260 --> 01:04:58,326
(gasps)

1410
01:04:58,361 --> 01:05:08,403


1411
01:05:08,405 --> 01:05:25,286


1412
01:05:32,328 --> 01:05:34,495
(creaking)

1413
01:05:34,530 --> 01:05:44,572


1414
01:05:44,574 --> 01:05:53,281


1415
01:05:53,316 --> 01:05:56,417
(otherworldly sounds)

1416
01:05:56,452 --> 01:05:57,652


1417
01:05:57,687 --> 01:06:00,621
(grunting)

1418
01:06:00,656 --> 01:06:02,256
Beatrice?

1419
01:06:02,291 --> 01:06:10,431


1420
01:06:10,466 --> 01:06:11,366
Ashen!

1421
01:06:11,401 --> 01:06:13,167
Yeah, yeah?

1422
01:06:13,202 --> 01:06:14,535
We gotta get her to the
hospital right now.

1423
01:06:14,570 --> 01:06:15,603
We gotta go right now.

1424
01:06:15,638 --> 01:06:17,071
Get the door.

1425
01:06:17,106 --> 01:06:19,207
Stay calm, Theresa. Just be
careful.

1426
01:06:19,242 --> 01:06:20,708
I want you to stay calm and
relax

1427
01:06:20,743 --> 01:06:22,577
and focus on the baby right
now.

1428
01:06:22,612 --> 01:06:25,380
I need you to be quiet because
she needs to stay calm.

1429
01:06:25,415 --> 01:06:27,548
Just stay calm.

1430
01:06:27,583 --> 01:06:28,449
Just breathe.

1431
01:06:28,484 --> 01:06:29,550
Stay warm.

1432
01:06:29,585 --> 01:06:32,387


1433
01:06:32,422 --> 01:06:36,324
All right, go, go, go.

1434
01:06:36,359 --> 01:06:38,559
- I need you to breathe. -We
need to find Rachel.

1435
01:06:38,594 --> 01:06:40,661
- Are you having contractions?
- We have to go find Rachel.

1436
01:06:40,696 --> 01:06:42,030
There's something else here.

1437
01:06:42,065 --> 01:06:44,499
Okay, just relax, all right?

1438
01:06:44,534 --> 01:06:45,533
It's okay.

1439
01:06:45,568 --> 01:06:47,301
Hey.

1440
01:06:47,336 --> 01:06:50,438


1441
01:06:50,473 --> 01:06:51,639
Kill her.

1442
01:06:51,674 --> 01:06:55,543
How far are we from the
hospital?

1443
01:06:55,578 --> 01:06:56,711
No, no, no, no.

1444
01:06:56,746 --> 01:06:59,313
(Panting)

1445
01:06:59,348 --> 01:07:00,715
- Dax. -Yeah?

1446
01:07:00,750 --> 01:07:02,517
- In the glove box. -Yeah?

1447
01:07:02,552 --> 01:07:04,185
I need you to get me
something.

1448
01:07:04,220 --> 01:07:06,320
Look at me. You're gonna be
fine.

1449
01:07:06,355 --> 01:07:07,588
I'm here, okay?

1450
01:07:07,623 --> 01:07:09,190
I love you.

1451
01:07:09,225 --> 01:07:15,430


1452

Dax.

1456
01:07:35,384 --> 01:07:36,651
Dax!

1457
01:07:36,686 --> 01:07:38,553
Come on, come on, come on.

1458
01:07:38,588 --> 01:07:41,856
Please, Dax.

1459
01:07:41,891 --> 01:07:44,392
Come on. Oh my God.

1460
01:07:44,427 --> 01:07:45,493
Ah, my legs!

1461
01:07:45,528 --> 01:07:47,462

Go!

1465

No!

No!

1467
01:07:53,569 --> 01:07:54,769
Don't let me burn.

(Screaming)

1469
01:07:56,572 --> 01:07:57,538

(Gunshots)

1484
01:08:41,584 --> 01:08:43,518
Get on your fucking feet!

1490
01:08:56,966 --> 01:08:59,800
Get out of my head.

1491
01:08:59,835 --> 01:09:02,436
Please let me go.

1492
01:09:02,471 --> 01:09:04,705
Kill her.

1493
01:09:04,740 --> 01:09:08,442
I'm sorry.

1494
01:09:08,477 --> 01:09:08,776

01:09:24,361 --> 01:09:29,964


1500
01:09:31,500 --> 01:09:39,373


1501
01:09:43,446 --> 01:09:45,613
(panting)

1502
01:09:45,648 --> 01:09:54,422


1503
01:09:54,457 --> 01:09:56,624
(sobbing)

1504
01:09:56,659 --> 01:10:10,638


1505
01:10:10,673 --> 01:10:13,708
911. What's the nature of your
emergency?

1506
01:10:13,743 --> 01:10:15,309
I need help.

1507
01:10:15,344 --> 01:10:17,712
Miss, what is your emergency?

1508
01:10:17,747 --> 01:10:19,714
My best friend is dead.

1509
01:10:19,749 --> 01:10:21,582
Dead? Are you sure?

1510
01:10:21,617 --> 01:10:24,318
What is your location?

1511
01:10:24,353 --> 01:10:26,787
Miss, I need you to remain
calm.

1512
01:10:26,822 --> 01:10:28,990
What is your location?

1513
01:10:29,025 --> 01:10:30,925
I'm at the King's Ransom
Winery.

1514
01:10:30,960 --> 01:10:32,393
I don't know what happened.

1515
01:10:32,428 --> 01:10:34,295
Are you sure your friend is
dead?

1516
01:10:34,330 --> 01:10:36,464
Can you tell me what happened?

1517
01:10:36,499 --> 01:10:37,732
Hello?

1518
01:10:37,767 --> 01:10:39,767
I think I killed him.

1519
01:10:39,802 --> 01:10:40,835
You think you killed him?

1520
01:10:40,870 --> 01:10:42,003
Miss, did I hear you
correctly?

1521
01:10:42,038 --> 01:10:43,004
Miss?

1522
01:10:43,039 --> 01:10:44,272
Hello?

1523
01:10:44,307 --> 01:10:45,439


1524
01:10:45,474 --> 01:10:46,540
Hello?

1525
01:10:46,575 --> 01:10:48,943
Can you hear me, miss?

1526
01:10:48,978 --> 01:10:50,011
Are you there?

1527
01:10:50,046 --> 01:10:51,912
Miss?

1528
01:10:51,947 --> 01:10:54,815
I'm dispatching emergency
crews right away.

1529
01:10:54,850 --> 01:10:56,751
I need you to stay on the
line, okay?

1530
01:10:56,786 --> 01:11:06,828


1531
01:11:06,830 --> 01:11:19,073


1532
01:11:19,108 --> 01:11:22,376
(otherworldly sounds)

1533
01:11:22,411 --> 01:11:30,551


1534
01:11:30,586 --> 01:11:32,953
(zapping)

1535
01:11:32,988 --> 01:11:33,954
Hello?

1536
01:11:33,989 --> 01:11:34,922
Are you there?

1537
01:11:34,957 --> 01:11:36,657
Miss?

1538
01:11:38,060 --> 01:11:40,461


1539
01:11:40,496 --> 01:11:41,762
(banging)

1540
01:11:41,797 --> 01:11:48,969


1541
01:11:49,004 --> 01:11:50,604
I can help you.

1542
01:11:50,639 --> 01:11:52,740
Come this way.

1543
01:11:52,775 --> 01:11:58,913


1544
01:11:58,948 --> 01:12:00,514
Theresa.

1545
01:12:00,549 --> 01:12:02,450
Theresa, come over here.

1546
01:12:02,485 --> 01:12:08,489


1547
01:12:08,524 --> 01:12:09,790
(pained cry)

1548
01:12:09,825 --> 01:12:12,593


1549
01:12:12,628 --> 01:12:13,394
(screams)

1550
01:12:13,429 --> 01:12:14,528
Step in there.

1551
01:12:14,563 --> 01:12:15,830
It's safe in there.

1552
01:12:27,676 --> 01:12:29,777
They like to make you afraid.

1553
01:12:29,812 --> 01:12:31,979
Whatever scares you the most,

1554
01:12:32,014 --> 01:12:33,948
they know what it is.

1555
01:12:33,983 --> 01:12:36,484
What do they want?

1556
01:12:36,519 --> 01:12:38,386
Rachel can tell you.

1557
01:12:38,421 --> 01:12:40,421
You have to talk to her.

1558
01:12:40,456 --> 01:12:42,156
It's the only way.

1559
01:12:46,195 --> 01:12:48,129
Yeah.

1560
01:12:48,164 --> 01:12:50,765
Have you seen them?

1561
01:12:50,800 --> 01:12:53,567
No.

1562
01:12:53,602 --> 01:12:56,170
What do they look like?

1563
01:12:56,205 --> 01:12:58,005
They're beautiful.

1564
01:12:58,040 --> 01:13:02,443


1565
01:13:04,914 --> 01:13:05,980
Are you afraid?

1566
01:13:06,015 --> 01:13:08,182


1567
01:13:08,217 --> 01:13:11,419
That's what they like.

1568
01:13:11,454 --> 01:13:14,455
I'm scared too.

1569
01:13:14,490 --> 01:13:18,058
But they can't hurt you, can
they?

1570
01:13:18,093 --> 01:13:19,560
Yeah.

1571
01:13:19,595 --> 01:13:21,862
But in a different way.

1572
01:13:24,567 --> 01:13:25,900
I'm gonna go see where they
are.

1573
01:13:25,935 --> 01:13:26,967
You stay.

1574
01:13:27,002 --> 01:13:27,968
Okay?

1575
01:13:28,003 --> 01:13:38,045


1576
01:13:38,047 --> 01:13:51,525


1577
01:13:51,560 --> 01:13:53,027
(panting)

1578
01:13:53,062 --> 01:13:55,663
(otherworldly sounds)

1579
01:14:01,237 --> 01:14:04,038
Run!

1580
01:14:07,510 --> 01:14:09,910
(Alarm blaring)

1581
01:14:16,118 --> 01:14:18,919
(rumbling)

1582
01:14:25,294 --> 01:14:29,263
(eerie sounds)

1583
01:14:29,298 --> 01:14:32,800
Ma'am, were you are you taking
something?

1584
01:14:32,835 --> 01:14:34,502
What's going on? Calm down.

1585
01:14:34,537 --> 01:14:36,604
We need an 11-41.

1586
01:14:36,639 --> 01:14:39,507
What are you doing? What are
you doing?

1587
01:14:39,542 --> 01:14:41,575
Don't go in there! Don't let
him go in there.

1588
01:14:41,610 --> 01:14:42,776
It's okay. He'll be okay.

1589
01:14:42,811 --> 01:14:44,612
He'll be okay.

1590
01:14:44,647 --> 01:14:45,913
I'll be right back.

1591
01:14:51,820 --> 01:14:53,687
(Sobbing)

1592
01:14:53,722 --> 01:14:56,123
(engine struggling to start)

1593
01:15:05,334 --> 01:15:08,102
(siren blaring)

1594
01:15:15,611 --> 01:15:18,178
(police dispatch)

1595
01:15:18,213 --> 01:15:25,819


1596
01:15:25,854 --> 01:15:28,022
In case I don't make it out
alive,

1597
01:15:28,057 --> 01:15:31,025
I want everyone to know what's
going on.

1598
01:15:34,697 --> 01:15:36,964
There's something here.

1599
01:15:36,999 --> 01:15:38,666
It's not human.

1600
01:15:38,701 --> 01:15:40,334
It's not a ghost.

1601
01:15:42,705 --> 01:15:47,808
It's a beautiful light

1602
01:15:47,843 --> 01:15:50,778
but there's something sinister
at its core.

1603
01:15:55,117 --> 01:15:59,086
And there's only one person that knows how to make it go away.

1604
01:15:59,121 --> 01:16:02,189
That's Rachel Till.

1605
01:16:02,224 --> 01:16:04,058
And I'm gonna find her.

1606
01:16:10,933 --> 01:16:13,300
(Woman singing in foreign
language)

1607
01:16:13,335 --> 01:16:23,578


1608
01:16:23,580 --> 01:16:43,598


1609
01:16:43,600 --> 01:16:55,275


1610
01:16:55,310 --> 01:16:57,311
Rachel?

1611
01:16:57,346 --> 01:16:59,046
Rachel?!

1612
01:16:59,081 --> 01:17:02,116


1613
01:17:02,151 --> 01:17:02,983
I'm here.

1614
01:17:03,018 --> 01:17:13,060


1615
01:17:13,062 --> 01:17:33,080


1616
01:17:33,082 --> 01:17:53,834


1617
01:17:53,869 --> 01:17:57,004
Why are they trying to kill
me?

1618
01:17:57,039 --> 01:18:00,974
I used to be beautiful like
you.

1619
01:18:01,009 --> 01:18:03,811
If they wanted me dead, I'd be
dead by now, wouldn't I?

1620
01:18:03,846 --> 01:18:06,346
What do they want?

1621
01:18:06,381 --> 01:18:10,918
They bred out fear,

1622
01:18:10,953 --> 01:18:14,288
which is the foundation of all
emotion.

1623
01:18:14,323 --> 01:18:18,792
Without emotion there's no
desire to breed,

1624
01:18:18,827 --> 01:18:21,428
to explore, no will to live.

1625
01:18:21,463 --> 01:18:23,497
They are dying.

1626
01:18:23,532 --> 01:18:26,300
So they come here on occasion

1627
01:18:26,335 --> 01:18:30,137
to study it and...

1628
01:18:30,172 --> 01:18:32,973
extract it.

1629
01:18:33,008 --> 01:18:38,178


1630
01:18:38,213 --> 01:18:39,480
Extract it...

1631
01:18:39,515 --> 01:18:41,215
how?

1632
01:18:41,250 --> 01:18:43,517
What is living inside you is
not human,

1633
01:18:43,552 --> 01:18:46,220
and if it is born...

1634
01:18:46,255 --> 01:18:48,355
God help us.

1635
01:18:48,390 --> 01:18:51,358
They're gonna take my baby.

1636
01:18:51,393 --> 01:18:53,227
Aren't they?

1637
01:18:53,262 --> 01:18:54,962
I stopped them.

1638
01:18:54,997 --> 01:18:57,364
Rory and Beatrice stopped
them.

1639
01:18:57,399 --> 01:18:59,199
Now you must...

1640
01:18:59,234 --> 01:19:02,836
stop them.

1641
01:19:02,871 --> 01:19:05,239
(Grunting)

1642
01:19:05,274 --> 01:19:15,316


1643
01:19:15,318 --> 01:19:30,164


1644
01:19:30,199 --> 01:19:33,167
(sobbing)

1645
01:19:33,202 --> 01:19:35,169
(coughing)

1646
01:19:35,204 --> 01:19:37,137
(grunting)

1647
01:19:37,172 --> 01:19:50,484


1648
01:19:50,519 --> 01:19:53,253
(weeping)

1649
01:19:53,288 --> 01:19:57,324


1650
01:19:57,359 --> 01:19:59,393
(otherworldly sounds)

1651
01:19:59,428 --> 01:20:01,061
Take it.

1652
01:20:01,096 --> 01:20:09,203


1653
01:20:09,238 --> 01:20:11,572
(gasping)

1654
01:20:11,607 --> 01:20:18,912


1655
01:20:18,947 --> 01:20:21,315
(screaming)

1656
01:20:21,350 --> 01:20:31,392


1657
01:20:31,394 --> 01:20:38,198


1658
01:20:38,233 --> 01:20:39,299
(screaming)

1659
01:20:39,334 --> 01:20:41,935


1660
01:20:41,970 --> 01:20:43,303
(high-pitched whistle and
boom)

1661
01:20:43,338 --> 01:20:53,380


1662
01:20:53,382 --> 01:21:13,400


1663
01:21:13,402 --> 01:21:33,420


1664
01:21:33,422 --> 01:21:53,440


1665
01:21:53,442 --> 01:22:00,280


1666
01:22:00,315 --> 01:22:02,482
(grunting)

1667
01:22:02,517 --> 01:22:13,060


1668
01:22:16,198 --> 01:22:18,999
(otherworldly sounds)

1669
01:22:32,447 --> 01:22:35,048
(clicking)

1670
01:22:41,390 --> 01:22:42,556
(zapping)

1671
01:22:42,591 --> 01:22:52,633


1672
01:22:52,635 --> 01:23:12,653


1673
01:23:12,655 --> 01:23:32,673


1674
01:23:32,675 --> 01:23:52,292


1675
01:24:00,435 --> 01:24:10,077


1676
01:24:18,887 --> 01:24:21,488
(otherworldly sounds)

1677
01:24:38,707 --> 01:24:40,407
Theresa!

1678
01:24:40,442 --> 01:24:43,577
Theresa?

1679
01:24:43,612 --> 01:24:45,445
Are you here?

1680
01:24:48,450 --> 01:24:52,452
I don't think she's here.

1681
01:24:52,487 --> 01:24:53,386
Help.

1682
01:24:59,728 --> 01:25:01,461
Help me.

1683
01:25:01,496 --> 01:25:03,497
Please.

1684
01:25:03,532 --> 01:25:04,698
Is that her?

1685
01:25:04,733 --> 01:25:07,801
I dunno.

1686
01:25:07,836 --> 01:25:10,437
Why'd you stab yourself?

1687
01:25:10,472 --> 01:25:12,205
What?

1688
01:25:12,240 --> 01:25:13,640
I need a doctor.

1689
01:25:13,675 --> 01:25:14,341
Please.

1690
01:25:14,376 --> 01:25:15,809
Help me.

1691
01:25:15,844 --> 01:25:17,611
What happened to your friends?

1692
01:25:17,646 --> 01:25:22,716


1693
01:25:22,751 --> 01:25:25,619
They're all fucking dead.

1694
01:25:26,488 --> 01:25:27,787
They're all fucking dead.

1695
01:25:27,822 --> 01:25:29,890


1696
01:25:29,925 --> 01:25:31,791
Holy shit. Did you hear that?

1697
01:25:31,826 --> 01:25:33,627
Yeah.

1698
01:25:33,662 --> 01:25:35,662
That's crazy.

1699
01:25:35,697 --> 01:25:37,297
No, wait.

1700
01:25:37,332 --> 01:25:40,167
Wait, please.

1701
01:25:40,202 --> 01:25:42,335
Hey, what the fuck was that?

1702
01:25:42,370 --> 01:25:43,803
I dunno. And I don't wanna
find out.

1703
01:25:43,838 --> 01:25:46,706
Let's get out of here.
