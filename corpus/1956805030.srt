1
00:02:30,875 --> 00:02:33,024
This is the fourth fire this summer.

2
00:02:34,770 --> 00:02:35,770
Benji...

3
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:37,740
Hello...

4
00:02:38,916 --> 00:02:41,705
- Hey!
- Is that why you called me here, Ben?

5
00:02:43,618 --> 00:02:44,951
What is the new boy?

6
00:02:45,488 --> 00:02:47,354
- Alisha!
- Does this boy have a name?

7
00:02:47,505 --> 00:02:48,612
He just moved here.

8
00:02:48,637 --> 00:02:50,754
I watch them train
with Bryce every day.

9
00:02:50,823 --> 00:02:53,148
- Bryce Hunter?
- The gorilla that Bryce Hunter hates you?

10
00:02:53,172 --> 00:02:54,639
Bryce Hunter hates you!

11
00:02:54,815 --> 00:02:56,964
You're fantasizing about him, aren't you?

12
00:02:57,106 --> 00:02:59,199
Ben! Hello...

13
00:02:59,968 --> 00:03:03,745
- Are you still in the land of fantasy?
- Oh, he did.

Okay, let's get out of here!

44
00:05:54,822 --> 00:05:58,562
- No, Allison, wait.
- Oh, you cannot command Her Majesty.

45
00:05:59,424 --> 00:06:01,513
- Is he the boy who...
- you are chasing...

46
00:06:01,568 --> 00:06:03,800
you chase, all summer long?

47
00:06:03,934 --> 00:06:05,489
I just admire him from afar.

48
00:06:05,563 --> 00:06:08,562
You admire him every day
and not that far away.

49
00:06:08,588 --> 00:06:10,788
You're a persecutor, a gay pursuer!

50
00:06:10,994 --> 00:06:12,753
I'm not a gay persecutor.

51
00:06:12,941 --> 00:06:14,924
Okay, we have to be in rehearsal.

52
00:06:15,099 --> 00:06:16,832
Will you sing with us or not?

53
00:06:17,101 --> 00:06:19,082
Give up. I will not sing in front of people.

54
00:06:20,297 --> 00:06:22,023
Oh, God, he's leaving.

55
00:06:22,448 --> 00:06:25,051
I will not follow you,
as you follow him.

56
00:06:25,802 --> 00:06:26,802
All right!

57
00:06:27,752 --> 00:06:29,444
See you at school tomorrow.

58
00:06:30,245 --> 00:06:32,230
Enjoy the latter summer day.

59
00:07:17,827 --> 00:07:18,827
Tim Wyman.

60
00:07:20,327 --> 00:07:21,327
It is.

61
00:07:22,816 --> 00:07:24,097
What?

62
00:07:33,468 --> 00:07:36,188
Do you even know if he will study
at this school.

63
00:07:36,259 --> 00:07:38,092
How can I know this?

64
00:07:38,201 --> 00:07:41,301
And you will chase him every day?

65
00:07:43,957 --> 00:07:46,441
- This is him!
- Who?

66
00:07:46,801 --> 00:07:51,244
Blue shoes.
Nice ass.

67
00:07:56,491 --> 00:07:59,381
That ass is the tip.

68
00:07:59,773 --> 00:08:02,751
- He's a pretty good ass to them.
- Honey!

69
00:08:11,991 --> 00:08:14,467
Okay, class, let's get started.

70
00:08:15,696 --> 00:08:18,944
Welcome to Spanish Level 3.
My name is Mr Langdon.

71
00:08:19,228 --> 00:08:23,349
I'm a student intern, but Mrs. Guerta
will be on hand to help us a lot.

72
00:08:23,403 --> 00:08:24,934
Senor Langdon?

73
00:08:25,067 --> 00:08:28,448
- Yes miss...
- Krista. My name is Krista Norman.

74
00:08:29,083 --> 00:08:30,403
Yes, Krista.

75
00:08:30,453 --> 00:08:34,265
Signor Langdon, how do you know
so good Spanish?

76
00:08:35,066 --> 00:08:36,714
Yes, thank you, miss.

77
00:08:36,980 --> 00:08:41,018
My parents and I lived in Colombia,
when I was a child.

78
00:08:41,544 --> 00:08:45,744
So you can ask me
questions in Spanish.

79
00:08:47,692 --> 00:08:50,598
What will you ask, for example... you.

80
00:08:51,152 --> 00:08:52,316
Sir...

81
00:08:53,649 --> 00:08:55,789
Benjamin, Ben Bentley.

82
00:08:56,090 --> 00:08:58,675
All right, Benjamin. What would you like
to ask?

83
00:08:59,901 --> 00:09:02,746
Where did you buy your...

84
00:09:06,317 --> 00:09:08,409
shoes, Senor Langdon.

85
00:09:08,464 --> 00:09:11,764
Very well, Benjamin,
but you didn't "buy",

86
00:09:11,921 --> 00:09:14,686
Where you "bought" your shoes.

87
00:09:15,481 --> 00:09:18,353
Someone else?
Okay, by the way.

88
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:20,991
Senor Langdon?

89
00:09:21,297 --> 00:09:23,730
Can I ask you...

90
00:09:23,959 --> 00:09:27,646
How is the Spanish "fagot"?

91
00:09:33,098 --> 00:09:34,481
Excuse me, sir?

92
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:36,933
This is Spanish, 3rd year.

93
00:09:37,367 --> 00:09:40,046
Don't we have to learn more
lingo this year?

94
00:09:40,586 --> 00:09:43,720
Yes, there are a few words about...

95
00:09:43,931 --> 00:09:47,506
There are a few words... that one can
to use... to say...

96
00:09:47,551 --> 00:09:51,683
- meaning...
- And what is its name...

97
00:09:53,899 --> 00:09:55,432
"mariposa" ("butterfly")

98
00:09:56,787 --> 00:09:58,754
It's called "Mariposa".

99
00:10:00,614 --> 00:10:02,723
Okay, now let's get started...

100
00:10:29,757 --> 00:10:32,132
I'm tired of chasing him
every day.

101
00:10:35,799 --> 00:10:39,914
I just have to go and meet you.

102
00:10:46,726 --> 00:10:48,092
Watch out!

103
00:10:51,362 --> 00:10:54,171
Oh my God! Oh!

104
00:10:54,225 --> 00:10:56,913
Hell, you bastard!

105
00:10:58,199 --> 00:11:00,245
- Hold on, I'm coming down!
- What's your problem?

106
00:11:00,253 --> 00:11:02,194
I am learning now. I am incomplete.

107
00:11:02,381 --> 00:11:06,197
- Tell me it's not broken.
- I don't know, but maybe my ankle is.

108
00:11:06,239 --> 00:11:09,465
- You're bleeding, can you go?
- Of course I can't help without help.

109
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:12,536
- Okay, how do we do that?
- Just grab me from behind and pick me up.

110
00:11:17,574 --> 00:11:20,712
I guess we have to jump to
the nearest house and ask for transportation.

111
00:11:20,738 --> 00:11:23,597
- No, your house is across the street.
- My house?

112
00:11:24,260 --> 00:11:26,345
Yes, well, let's go.

113
00:11:28,098 --> 00:11:30,398
- Is there anyone home?
- My parents are away for a while.

114
00:11:30,406 --> 00:11:32,694
Why... Okay, I hold you, I hold you.

115
00:11:32,708 --> 00:11:36,441
- I'm fine, I'm fine.
- You're bleeding. It must be cleaned.

116
00:11:36,449 --> 00:11:38,769
- I am fine.
- Give me the keys.

117
00:11:38,823 --> 00:11:42,557
- You will not drive my car!
- To ride with that foot? Give me the keys.

118
00:11:48,122 --> 00:11:50,286
Break my car and I'll kill you.

119
00:12:02,278 --> 00:12:05,132
Hole! Hole!

120
00:12:09,910 --> 00:12:12,402
- Change gear.
- The gear?

121
00:12:12,503 --> 00:12:14,864
- Go to second.
- What to do?

122
00:12:14,872 --> 00:12:19,660
Push the connector
and then lever forward.

123
00:12:23,549 --> 00:12:27,611
- Who doesn't know how to change gears?
- Gay men? Probably.

124
00:12:30,604 --> 00:12:33,908
- Do you know at least some brand of car?
- Yes.

125
00:12:34,552 --> 00:12:39,036
Bentley, Bentley, but I don't know anything
more about them.

126
00:12:39,746 --> 00:12:42,496
So, Benjamin, you know my name
and my address.

127
00:12:43,508 --> 00:12:45,632
Ben, just Ben.

128
00:12:46,671 --> 00:12:48,522
I'll tell you Benjamin.

129
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:55,948
You can't train at least
one week.

130
00:12:56,011 --> 00:12:58,589
- And we need to call your parents.
- We are friends...

131
00:12:59,852 --> 00:13:02,184
- roughly.
- My parents are in Switzerland.

132
00:13:02,341 --> 00:13:05,365
Well, we have to call
to your parents, which is...

133
00:13:05,390 --> 00:13:07,593
This is the boy who scares me.
He is my best friend.

134
00:13:07,601 --> 00:13:09,106
- Ben Bentley.
- Tell him Benjamin.

135
00:13:09,122 --> 00:13:11,410
I'll get my mother to call
to his parents.

136
00:13:11,465 --> 00:13:12,886
That's great!

137
00:13:27,886 --> 00:13:29,894
The Fettucines Alfredo are almost ready.

138
00:13:30,125 --> 00:13:33,015
- I think they are enough.
- Can you cook?

139
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:36,748
Indian superpower!

140
00:13:39,115 --> 00:13:42,497
Hey, can you bring a pillow
and my clothes from my room upstairs?

141
00:13:43,798 --> 00:13:45,696
Yes of course.

142
00:13:47,050 --> 00:13:48,268
Thanks.

143
00:14:41,185 --> 00:14:44,439
- Love this song.
- Yes.

144
00:15:35,958 --> 00:15:37,552
You sound great!

145
00:15:38,636 --> 00:15:41,837
Try. I'll stop it.

146
00:15:42,861 --> 00:15:48,035
Maybe I should prepare the tub
to change into clean clothes.

147
00:15:50,538 --> 00:15:53,996
- Want to help me with this?
- Yes of course.

148
00:15:55,706 --> 00:15:58,159
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

149
00:16:23,796 --> 00:16:26,639
- What did you say?
- Nothing.

150
00:16:27,670 --> 00:16:29,997
Your bathtub is... ready.

151
00:16:30,098 --> 00:16:32,480
Cool. I'll call you later.

152
00:17:04,912 --> 00:17:06,232
Okay.

153
00:17:20,041 --> 00:17:22,845
I guess usually
you don't spend your evenings so much.

154
00:17:24,323 --> 00:17:26,706
Rarely heterosexual,
that are in the bath.

155
00:17:27,862 --> 00:17:29,541
You really are...

156
00:17:32,482 --> 00:17:34,513
What is it like to be gay?

157
00:17:36,973 --> 00:17:39,378
Like you. To be...

158
00:17:40,093 --> 00:17:42,421
- the way you are.
- Hetero.

159
00:17:44,277 --> 00:17:47,728
It must be hard for you...
I mean... with sex.

160
00:17:47,910 --> 00:17:51,797
Probably because of these difficulties.
I came out into the light.

161
00:17:52,631 --> 00:17:56,521
- I understand...
- Really?

162
00:17:56,706 --> 00:18:00,653
Sweet, you look good athlete with rich
parents and a sports car

163
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:03,199
understands what it's like to be me?

164
00:18:03,505 --> 00:18:05,905
Okay, I understand people are judging you.

165
00:18:06,733 --> 00:18:09,420
- You won't hear from me.
- Sorry...

166
00:18:09,519 --> 00:18:11,612
- I know I shouldn't have...
- No problem.

167
00:18:14,272 --> 00:18:16,271
Would it come to light again?

168
00:18:18,874 --> 00:18:21,867
Before... before I admit it...

169
00:18:22,386 --> 00:18:26,120
they invited me for a night's sleep.
These guys knew...

170
00:18:26,651 --> 00:18:32,089
that I will not cause trouble,
but when I came out into the light...

171
00:18:33,191 --> 00:18:35,300
they stopped.

172
00:18:36,812 --> 00:18:42,855
But I... I wanted... to mean
something for someone.

173
00:18:44,170 --> 00:18:47,247
I couldn't do that,
if I hide myself.

174
00:18:48,142 --> 00:18:50,437
And I did it anyway.

175
00:18:50,517 --> 00:18:52,626
And did that work?

176
00:18:53,618 --> 00:18:55,446
Not yet.

177
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:01,513
Look, I have to go home.

178
00:19:02,105 --> 00:19:07,726
Maybe you'll feel lonely, I'll watch
to rest a little and come back in the afternoon.

179
00:19:08,296 --> 00:19:11,718
- Really? Will you do it for me?
- Yes, if you wish.

180
00:19:12,623 --> 00:19:17,020
I'll go... first... clean up a bit in front.

181
00:19:17,028 --> 00:19:20,095
- Look, Benjamin, I'm sorry...
- Your clothes are on the bed...

182
00:19:37,843 --> 00:19:39,520
What is this observation for?

183
00:19:39,715 --> 00:19:44,074
To make sure you don't disappear again,
like you've been doing all week.

184
00:19:44,988 --> 00:19:46,514
Have Alison?

185
00:19:47,209 --> 00:19:48,998
I'll take a shower.

186
00:19:49,699 --> 00:19:51,492
Make a note of it.

187
00:20:14,783 --> 00:20:16,073
Mom!

188
00:20:16,635 --> 00:20:18,666
- What are you doing?
- Dear...

189
00:20:18,781 --> 00:20:20,515
you and I need to talk.

190
00:20:20,626 --> 00:20:23,297
- What? What you mean?
- Alison?

191
00:20:23,726 --> 00:20:26,622
I told you, we're rehearsing that thing
for the talent show.

192
00:20:26,630 --> 00:20:29,812
Yes, and Alison says you refuse
to sing in front of an audience.

193
00:20:29,854 --> 00:20:31,931
You... talked to Alison?

194
00:20:32,227 --> 00:20:34,687
You go to gay bars.

195
00:20:35,002 --> 00:20:36,885
- I knew it.
- What?

196
00:20:36,971 --> 00:20:38,627
- Honey...
- Oh my gosh.

197
00:20:38,651 --> 00:20:42,695
I want you to read these
and I want you to use these...

198
00:20:42,875 --> 00:20:48,125
I'm so shocked. How long
preparing for this?

199
00:20:48,228 --> 00:20:53,537
I know your age is difficult.
You're so lonely... but if you go...

200
00:20:53,553 --> 00:20:57,225
Oh my God, Mom, Mom I'm not walking
gay bars, only one boy...

201
00:20:57,601 --> 00:21:00,686
- from school, his name is Tim.
- Okay...

202
00:21:00,694 --> 00:21:03,536
No, it's not good. He is hetero.

203
00:21:05,210 --> 00:21:07,911
I hit him with my roller skates and

204
00:21:08,052 --> 00:21:12,106
I felt bad and was taking care of him.
I take care of him. And so much.

205
00:21:12,348 --> 00:21:15,643
- Oh, you like him.
- Oh my gosh.

206
00:21:15,675 --> 00:21:20,586
- You like it...
- Mom, will you stop this...

207
00:21:20,609 --> 00:21:22,601
- Oh my God...
- All right, invite him to dinner.

208
00:21:22,629 --> 00:21:27,518
- You give me condoms.
- I want you to use them, honey, is it okay?

209
00:21:27,931 --> 00:21:29,601
- I love you.
- I love you.

210
00:21:29,658 --> 00:21:32,978
- Hurry up. Get dressed.
- Do I really need to read this. God!

211
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:36,827
- He doesn't go to gay bars.
- All right.

212
00:21:37,343 --> 00:21:39,842
Take care of some boy. From school.

213
00:21:39,914 --> 00:21:43,613
- He is allowed everything.
- He doesn't miss everything. Relax.

214
00:21:43,749 --> 00:21:45,820
Okay. Where did you get to with him.

215
00:21:45,883 --> 00:21:49,118
- I gave him condoms.
- Are you serious?

216
00:21:49,141 --> 00:21:51,738
If I told you I was gay,
you would not do it.

217
00:21:51,778 --> 00:21:54,153
I'm sorry, you're not a lesbian.

218
00:21:54,309 --> 00:21:55,509
You are not a lesbian.

219
00:21:55,533 --> 00:21:58,580
Jane, you said you drove a Ferrari yesterday.

220
00:21:58,647 --> 00:22:01,146
- Oh, really?
- Ferrari!

221
00:22:01,564 --> 00:22:03,503
She saw you at the traffic light.

222
00:22:04,553 --> 00:22:07,811
- I can't drive that kind of car.
- Is this your friend Tim's car?

223
00:22:09,732 --> 00:22:12,599
- Tim, what's the big problem?
- Not a big problem.

224
00:22:12,678 --> 00:22:15,760
When Jane saw you
was during school hours.

225
00:22:15,793 --> 00:22:17,570
Oh, Ben!

226
00:22:17,873 --> 00:22:19,826
Are you running out of school?

227
00:22:19,940 --> 00:22:22,183
- Mom's not like that...
- Under Tim's influence, right?

228
00:22:22,242 --> 00:22:27,063
- Quite clearly...
- You're lying, running away from school, Adam...

229
00:22:27,941 --> 00:22:32,367
- From now on, you are punished. From now on.
- For what?

230
00:22:33,543 --> 00:22:37,040
- Without computer!
- All right. And only at home!

231
00:22:37,222 --> 00:22:41,421
You're not going anywhere, dating
with no one until we tell you the opposite.

232
00:22:41,798 --> 00:22:43,527
- This is not fair...
- It's fair.

233
00:22:43,563 --> 00:22:45,203
- This is not fair...
- It's fair.

234
00:22:45,716 --> 00:22:46,716
I hate you!

235
00:22:46,870 --> 00:22:49,792
- Do not walk away...
- No, don't, don't act like that...

236
00:23:56,349 --> 00:23:58,700
- What?
<i>- Hello, friend.</i>

237
00:24:02,758 --> 00:24:06,049
- Listen, I just wanted to...
<i>- Are you going to brag now?</i>

238
00:24:06,650 --> 00:24:10,352
God, don't tell me you're fucking
Krista Norman as we speak.

239
00:24:10,796 --> 00:24:13,823
She left.
<i>We quarreled a lot.</i>

240
00:24:13,991 --> 00:24:16,404
Yes, what dispute?

241
00:24:16,519 --> 00:24:19,128
The guy you left me with
with blue balls.

242
00:24:20,608 --> 00:24:22,592
Wouldn't you like to apologize to me?

243
00:24:23,573 --> 00:24:25,104
Well...

244
00:24:26,885 --> 00:24:28,818
would you like to come here?

245
00:24:31,124 --> 00:24:33,475
Maybe we will continue,
what we started?

246
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:41,800
- Yes, of course, I mean, well...
- Goth.

247
00:24:42,779 --> 00:24:44,474
I'll close now.

248
00:25:16,926 --> 00:25:19,689
- Hi...
- Hello.

249
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:38,601
I... uh...

250
00:25:50,672 --> 00:25:52,265
You can kiss me if you want...

251
00:25:54,498 --> 00:25:57,622
- Are you sure...
- See for yourself...

252
00:26:13,448 --> 00:26:14,725
Are you okay?

253
00:26:19,543 --> 00:26:21,610
It was my first kiss...

254
00:26:22,908 --> 00:26:24,841
Haven't you been with other guys?

255
00:26:28,020 --> 00:26:29,579
Get ready for your second.

256
00:26:57,806 --> 00:27:00,235
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

257
00:27:01,113 --> 00:27:02,831
Are you okay?

258
00:27:04,251 --> 00:27:06,344
My parents are coming home.

259
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:10,160
Calm down, there's still time.

260
00:27:10,202 --> 00:27:13,424
Oh, no, no, my parents.
I'm being punished right now.

261
00:27:14,226 --> 00:27:16,046
Hey, listen, listen...

262
00:27:16,182 --> 00:27:18,424
- About last night...
- No, Tim, I understand...

263
00:27:18,566 --> 00:27:21,213
Hey, hey, hey. You are amazing.

264
00:27:21,731 --> 00:27:24,379
I just want it to be
only between you and me.

265
00:27:25,643 --> 00:27:26,643
Right?

266
00:27:26,769 --> 00:27:29,940
Yes, I just don't want people to think of me
about being gay when I'm not.

267
00:27:31,286 --> 00:27:33,184
You're not... gay...

268
00:27:36,372 --> 00:27:37,982
On one condition.

269
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:40,396
What is it?

270
00:27:42,020 --> 00:27:43,426
Call me.

271
00:27:45,308 --> 00:27:46,800

Ready to learn something new for you?
You are bad.

309
00:30:36,307 --> 00:30:39,256
My mother insisted, and my father had
unnecessary place here.

310
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:42,066
My occupation can be
a little clammy.

311
00:31:00,151 --> 00:31:01,822
This is my studio.

312
00:31:03,854 --> 00:31:05,604
You have many secrets.

313
00:31:13,965 --> 00:31:17,379
- This is fascinating!
- Oh, i do not know...

314
00:31:19,860 --> 00:31:21,727
You have to be proud of that.

315
00:31:36,679 --> 00:31:38,356
It certainly should.

316
00:31:41,088 --> 00:31:42,478
You are amazing!

317
00:31:43,958 --> 00:31:45,535
Take her!

318
00:31:47,257 --> 00:31:48,994
- Really?
- Yes.

319
00:31:52,471 --> 00:31:53,865
Really.

320
00:32:03,222 --> 00:32:05,214
I think too...

321
00:32:05,555 --> 00:32:08,367
that you have to sing in the talent show
with Alison's group.

322
00:32:08,959 --> 00:32:10,162
- Yes?
- Yes.

323
00:32:11,458 --> 00:32:14,858
I'll sing if you introduce me
to their parents.

324
00:32:17,027 --> 00:32:20,418
- My parents are out of town.
- Again?

325
00:32:20,884 --> 00:32:24,290
- Do they ever take you with them?
- I do not interfere with them, neither do they.

326
00:32:24,850 --> 00:32:27,050
You are every teenager's dream.

327
00:32:27,218 --> 00:32:31,283
But I had to go to Mexico
City, with my mother's family.

328
00:32:32,198 --> 00:32:33,198
How was it?

329
00:32:34,008 --> 00:32:36,474
Beautiful. Friends,

330
00:32:37,341 --> 00:32:40,395
who I met,
they took me to the Popocatepetl volcano.

331
00:32:41,306 --> 00:32:44,847
- Popo... what?
- Pop-cat-cock. It's a volcano.

332
00:32:47,663 --> 00:32:50,545
With that Spanish accent
do you know the language well?

333
00:32:52,027 --> 00:32:53,988
Perfect.

334
00:32:55,121 --> 00:32:57,129
Then why do you study Spanish in school?

335
00:32:57,405 --> 00:32:58,670
Easy Six.

336
00:32:58,966 --> 00:33:01,942
- Oh, cheater.
- Yes and what?

337
00:33:06,595 --> 00:33:09,747
Tell me something in... Spanish.

338
00:33:10,302 --> 00:33:12,693
- I'm not your trained puppy.
- Come on, Tim.

339
00:33:14,105 --> 00:33:15,440
Something good.

340
00:33:22,859 --> 00:33:26,372
- Calling me a fagot is something nice?
- What?

341
00:33:26,878 --> 00:33:29,377
- I'm not...
- You were there that hour...

342
00:33:29,543 --> 00:33:30,823
Senor Langdon...

343
00:33:30,943 --> 00:33:32,239
- Yes.
- Did I change?

344
00:33:32,292 --> 00:33:36,134
I laughed because Mr Langdon
blushed like a virgin.

345
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:41,136
"Mariposa" means "butterfly" sort of our "fairy",
there is nothing offensive about this,

346
00:33:41,144 --> 00:33:46,016
- unless you take it out of context.
- In Bryce's context, it's insulting.

347
00:33:49,728 --> 00:33:51,727
You can't be serious.

348
00:34:01,612 --> 00:34:03,593
Oh, hi, you must be Benjamin.

349
00:34:03,632 --> 00:34:06,257
Yes, ma'am, I came to pick up
something from Tim...

350
00:34:06,339 --> 00:34:09,430
Hey, what's up, Benjamin.
Ah, here's your notes.

351
00:34:09,672 --> 00:34:12,517
Thanks, uh... what's that smell.

352
00:34:12,538 --> 00:34:16,165
These are my mother's cheerleaders.
They are great.

353
00:34:16,338 --> 00:34:19,314
Hey, Mom, can Benjamin
stay for dinner?

354
00:34:19,757 --> 00:34:21,967
Oh, of course.
Yes, of course, Benjamin.

355
00:34:22,259 --> 00:34:24,659
Dinner will be ready in 20 minutes.

356
00:34:26,778 --> 00:34:29,621
- Ready for that?
- My homework is written.

357
00:34:32,860 --> 00:34:39,453
God bless us and this food
in the name of our God Jesus Christ. Amen.

358
00:34:42,236 --> 00:34:45,780
- Tim keeps his friends a secret.
- Mom!

359
00:34:47,851 --> 00:34:51,202
I'm just saying it's nice to be
meet one of your friends.

360
00:34:51,210 --> 00:34:52,514
And so charming.

361
00:34:52,549 --> 00:34:55,150
Do you know his other friends?
His boyfriend?

362
00:34:55,427 --> 00:34:57,012
Of course he knows Krista.

363
00:34:58,499 --> 00:35:01,389
Yes, she's really great.

364
00:35:01,482 --> 00:35:03,216
It is very popular.

365
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:05,102
What about you, Benjamin?

366
00:35:05,391 --> 00:35:07,735
Which is your... beautiful girl.

367
00:35:11,612 --> 00:35:13,697
I have a boyfriend.

368
00:35:14,281 --> 00:35:16,105
It's very tasty. The food.

369
00:35:16,448 --> 00:35:20,330
If I can find a restaurant that
offers so much delicious Mexican food,

370
00:35:20,362 --> 00:35:21,695
I'll eat there every day.

371
00:35:21,842 --> 00:35:25,270
They will make a fortune. Maybe you should
to open such a restaurant, Mrs. Wyman.

372
00:35:25,358 --> 00:35:27,741
Oh, thank you, Benjamin.

373
00:35:53,512 --> 00:35:54,902
Hello.

374
00:36:01,126 --> 00:36:03,059
They don't want me to see you anymore.

375
00:36:03,436 --> 00:36:04,574
Yes, but you see me...

376
00:36:04,582 --> 00:36:07,559
Yes, but they don't let me
to see you more.

377
00:36:07,781 --> 00:36:09,989
- I thought I liked them.
- Yes, that's right, Benjamin.

378
00:36:10,013 --> 00:36:11,637
But they are also Catholic.

379
00:36:11,775 --> 00:36:13,766
Hey Tim, hello.

380
00:36:14,202 --> 00:36:16,303
- Is everything alright?
- Give us a minute.

381
00:36:22,255 --> 00:36:24,552
Tim, maybe they just need it
time to realize it.

382
00:36:24,599 --> 00:36:29,114
You will not fool them with your nonsense,
how authentic my mother's food is.

383
00:36:29,162 --> 00:36:31,216
Okay, they won't see me again.

384
00:36:31,370 --> 00:36:33,737
I knew it would.
So stupid.

385
00:36:34,256 --> 00:36:35,977
Everything will be as before...

386
00:36:36,009 --> 00:36:39,342
Oh, so, what if
caught us together?

387
00:36:41,823 --> 00:36:44,278
- We'll figure out something if...
- That's not funny.

388
00:36:44,642 --> 00:36:46,415
They will look at me
different now.

389
00:36:46,466 --> 00:36:49,459
Why I invite a gay boy to dinner,
instead of your girlfriend.

390
00:36:49,489 --> 00:36:51,156
- They will wonder.
- Stop it.

391
00:36:53,525 --> 00:36:56,792
Tim, we can do that
to work. Got it?

392
00:36:57,721 --> 00:36:59,470
We will be careful.

393
00:37:22,015 --> 00:37:25,123
- Oh, is that Tim? I want to congratulate him.
- Oh, no, no, no, Mom...

394
00:37:25,155 --> 00:37:27,724
Then tell me what to do...

395
00:37:34,672 --> 00:37:36,679
Is this Khrista?

396
00:37:37,298 --> 00:37:38,960
His boyfriend.

397
00:37:38,968 --> 00:37:44,280
Oh, but I heard you...
Do you think I'm deaf?

398
00:37:44,415 --> 00:37:45,693
Benjamin...

399
00:37:45,701 --> 00:37:47,342
Really?
He was...

400
00:37:47,366 --> 00:37:48,897
I was sentimental.

401
00:37:48,905 --> 00:37:52,155
Come on, back. Go, go girl.

402
00:37:52,197 --> 00:37:54,025
Here we go. Away from them.

403
00:38:29,275 --> 00:38:30,608
- Hello.
- Hello.

404
00:38:32,113 --> 00:38:34,393
- There is no one around.
- Great.

405
00:38:34,747 --> 00:38:36,352
You're so sexy.

406
00:38:37,801 --> 00:38:40,539
- And a little pot.
- You like me...

407
00:38:44,614 --> 00:38:50,138
Yeah, but... Aren't you tired of hiding,
and not be like normal boyfriends?

408
00:38:50,990 --> 00:38:53,461
For my parents' sake, I told you.

409
00:38:53,898 --> 00:38:56,223
We do what we always do we did.

410
00:38:59,205 --> 00:39:01,510
Who do you like more, me or Krista?

411
00:39:01,675 --> 00:39:03,627
I like you more.

412
00:39:05,877 --> 00:39:08,680
Yes, but who are you sleeping with?
Why with Krista?

413
00:39:08,859 --> 00:39:10,749
I sleep with you.

414
00:39:12,525 --> 00:39:15,106
Then drop it. Why do you need
when do you have me?

415
00:39:15,142 --> 00:39:17,735
- You make it so hard.
- It's even harder for me.

416
00:39:17,966 --> 00:39:19,839
The last birthday present.

417
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:23,986
I broke up with her.

418
00:39:24,851 --> 00:39:26,296
Because of you.

419
00:39:28,381 --> 00:39:30,341
- Because of me?
- Yes.

420
00:39:31,037 --> 00:39:32,583
I like you.

421
00:39:33,228 --> 00:39:34,626
And I want you.

422
00:39:35,300 --> 00:39:37,143
No matter what happens.

423
00:39:46,397 --> 00:39:47,931
The key to your home?

424
00:39:49,302 --> 00:39:50,903
No, it's not right.

425
00:39:51,250 --> 00:39:53,241
A romantic gesture, Benjamin.

426
00:39:55,701 --> 00:39:57,661
- Tell me something?
- Yes?

427
00:39:58,410 --> 00:40:01,051
Is that right what you told me
for the word "mariposa".

428
00:40:01,059 --> 00:40:02,059
Of course.

429
00:40:02,836 --> 00:40:04,218
Come on, say it again.

430
00:40:10,458 --> 00:40:13,265
This is not at all offensive.

431
00:40:14,649 --> 00:40:15,938
What does it mean?

432
00:40:16,574 --> 00:40:19,550
Means: Teach me to fly,
my beautiful butterfly.

433
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:23,548
- So I'm a butterfly...
- Yes, yes.

434
00:40:24,186 --> 00:40:26,279
You are a beautiful butterfly.

435
00:40:53,104 --> 00:40:56,235
Oh my gosh! God, fire!

436
00:41:07,092 --> 00:41:08,959
To split! Run there!

437
00:41:41,984 --> 00:41:44,557
- Look what I found.
- What? Where did you get it from?

438
00:41:44,621 --> 00:41:47,518
Bryce. He was there. He was watching us.

439
00:41:47,565 --> 00:41:50,026
- Bryce?
- I ran into him, after we parted.

440
00:41:50,285 --> 00:41:52,979
- He started the fire.
- What if the cops find us?

441
00:41:53,067 --> 00:41:55,101
If Bryce was there, we're screwed.

442
00:41:55,181 --> 00:41:57,344
- Tim, we're not...
- Yeah, we're fucked.

443
00:41:58,317 --> 00:42:00,659
How could you do this to me?

444
00:42:01,285 --> 00:42:03,801
I have not done anything.
I have not done anything.

445
00:42:03,866 --> 00:42:08,794
This is who we are.
We, you, are one and the same.

446
00:42:08,831 --> 00:42:10,098
I am not like you!

447
00:42:10,231 --> 00:42:12,521
I have no parents who support me
no matter what.

448
00:42:12,546 --> 00:42:15,691
I cannot live among the people who will
laughing and pointing at me constantly.

449
00:42:15,715 --> 00:42:19,242
I'm not like you and never will be
to be. I have to hide.

450
00:42:19,444 --> 00:42:22,588
You can't hide forever.
Don't act like Bryce.

451
00:42:22,596 --> 00:42:26,706
He hates himself so much,
that he hates the whole world.

452
00:42:26,753 --> 00:42:28,906
Fuck that. I can not.

453
00:42:28,935 --> 00:42:31,526
Do not touch me.
I can't handle it.

454
00:42:31,543 --> 00:42:33,495
Ola, Mariposa!

455
00:42:33,565 --> 00:42:37,169
Seriously? Is this the best,
what can you do?

456
00:42:37,316 --> 00:42:40,073
Stop it, look, Bryce,
don't create problems right now.

457
00:42:40,137 --> 00:42:43,817
Oh no, you two "maripos" are the ones
you have a problem.

458
00:42:43,852 --> 00:42:47,290
This means "butterfly". So much!
You just say "butterfly".

459
00:42:47,747 --> 00:42:50,973
Senor Langdon, he made you a fool.

460
00:42:51,896 --> 00:42:54,808
In fact, it's pretty sweet,
if you think about it.

461
00:42:56,497 --> 00:42:59,193
- What the hell, motherfucker?
- Seriously?

462
00:42:59,453 --> 00:43:01,517
- The baby cried.
- All right, everybody calm down.

463
00:43:01,549 --> 00:43:04,767
I will not calm down. That you saw us
together, that's not what Bryce wants

464
00:43:04,992 --> 00:43:08,713
- Come on, come on.
- Let's see how you do without a lighter.

465
00:43:09,048 --> 00:43:11,488
- Enough!
- Give me the lighter!

466
00:43:11,536 --> 00:43:13,418
Fuck you!

467
00:43:28,847 --> 00:43:33,146
Let's make a deal. You're closing
mouth for us and we remain silent for you.

468
00:43:40,208 --> 00:43:42,142
- Tim...
- We're done, Benjamin.

469
00:43:44,055 --> 00:43:45,343
Everything is over.

470
00:43:53,176 --> 00:43:54,277

<i>He's dead, Ben.</i>

492
00:47:03,237 --> 00:47:04,846
My father is dead.

493
00:47:06,378 --> 00:47:09,843
<i>Please come. I need you.</i>

494
00:47:28,515 --> 00:47:29,693
A funeral?

495
00:47:30,728 --> 00:47:31,728
Please?

496
00:47:32,235 --> 00:47:34,260
Are you traveling to a funeral?

497
00:47:35,783 --> 00:47:37,158
How do you know?

498
00:47:39,016 --> 00:47:40,641
Professional eye.

499
00:47:43,622 --> 00:47:46,387
Nobody looks sadder,
when it comes to a funeral.

500
00:47:47,071 --> 00:47:51,164
Because it's the night before Christmas,
and you're flying right now...

501
00:47:51,496 --> 00:47:53,402
not to mention the headache.

502
00:47:53,865 --> 00:47:55,893
Everything is clear to you huh?

503
00:47:59,467 --> 00:48:01,818
At the expense of the establishment.
It will help you.

504
00:48:02,460 --> 00:48:05,137
Believe me, I have problems too
with the headache.

505
00:48:07,038 --> 00:48:08,474
How did I do?

506
00:48:10,155 --> 00:48:11,732
Yes, I'm traveling to a funeral;

507
00:48:16,650 --> 00:48:18,489
I'm Jace, by the way.

508
00:48:20,496 --> 00:48:22,299
Your nameplate says Jason.

509
00:48:22,354 --> 00:48:24,283
Cruel bureaucracy.

510
00:48:24,323 --> 00:48:28,754
I told them to write to Jace,
but they said I was confusing people.

511
00:48:29,785 --> 00:48:31,714
Where do these things come from?

512
00:48:31,761 --> 00:48:33,182
Any store?

513
00:48:33,190 --> 00:48:36,339
If they had told me, I would have been alone
to buy it.

514
00:48:38,517 --> 00:48:41,024
I'm... I'm Ben. Bentley.

515
00:48:41,087 --> 00:48:44,456
If you were in our department, you would have
Benjamin plate.

516
00:48:44,950 --> 00:48:48,651
- Yes, everyone calls me Ben.
- Ben be.

517
00:48:49,233 --> 00:48:51,300
Only three letters. Very efficient.

518
00:48:52,922 --> 00:48:56,798
Uh... tell me how it happened,
that you work at Christmas?

519
00:48:57,332 --> 00:49:00,066
That is my only duty
is to serve people.

520
00:49:01,587 --> 00:49:03,000
And serve drinks.

521
00:49:03,803 --> 00:49:05,779
Where are you from, Ben.

522
00:49:07,014 --> 00:49:08,178
Chicago.

523
00:49:10,079 --> 00:49:11,359
Chicago...

524
00:49:13,011 --> 00:49:16,393
But... I'll be in Houston in two weeks.

525
00:49:21,484 --> 00:49:23,520
You know, we're forbidden

526
00:49:23,544 --> 00:49:27,168
because of company policy, let's invite
meeting passengers.

527
00:49:29,761 --> 00:49:32,481
- Right.
- Yes, that's right. I'm telling you.

528
00:49:33,513 --> 00:49:35,669
But I can invite anyone.

529
00:49:37,364 --> 00:49:40,362
You understand me... but

530
00:49:45,563 --> 00:49:48,003
I could help you, Benjamin.

531
00:50:20,947 --> 00:50:24,925
When Mom died... it was him
very sad.

532
00:50:25,520 --> 00:50:27,863
He just started to go off.

533
00:50:29,035 --> 00:50:31,714
But the worst part is, and I realize it,

534
00:50:32,015 --> 00:50:35,132
that when I lost him too,
I started to go out too.

535
00:50:36,551 --> 00:50:37,551
There is no.

536
00:50:42,912 --> 00:50:45,240
Do you remember what you told me,

537
00:50:45,792 --> 00:50:49,525
when we broke up with Tim and I was
sad for months?

538
00:50:50,932 --> 00:50:53,994
- "Get over it!"
- Exactly.

539
00:50:54,809 --> 00:50:57,082
Honey, I know you're sad now,

540
00:50:58,459 --> 00:51:00,920
but if you continue like that,
it will hurt even more.

541
00:51:03,258 --> 00:51:05,155
I'm glad that you're here.

542
00:51:05,524 --> 00:51:07,157
Me too.

543
00:51:08,301 --> 00:51:09,909
Do not walk away.

544
00:51:10,128 --> 00:51:13,205
- You are here anyway.
- Come to Austin with me.

545
00:51:13,344 --> 00:51:15,257
It's much more liberal there.

546
00:51:15,423 --> 00:51:18,809
You shouldn't be gay there
to hide.

547
00:51:19,138 --> 00:51:21,521
As you do, though.

548
00:51:21,904 --> 00:51:24,404
- Are you sure about that?
- Think about this.

549
00:51:24,613 --> 00:51:27,683
No more grumbling about the snow.

550
00:51:27,706 --> 00:51:31,473
A new beginning after the case of the one
a Chicago loser.

551
00:51:31,498 --> 00:51:34,323
- Is not...
- You'll be with your best friend again.

552
00:51:36,138 --> 00:51:37,959
We need to find an apartment.

553
00:51:42,060 --> 00:51:45,057
- Thanks, Ben.
- Everything is fine, everything is fine.

554
00:51:46,432 --> 00:51:48,915
- I'll get the car.
- Let's go.

555
00:51:55,601 --> 00:51:56,675
Hello?

556
00:51:56,699 --> 00:51:59,804
<i>I happen to know that funerals</i>
are not made before New Year.

557
00:51:59,954 --> 00:52:01,985
Jace, hello.

558
00:52:02,412 --> 00:52:04,710
Thanks. Thanks for calling.

559
00:52:05,337 --> 00:52:07,619
So, when will you see me?

560
00:52:08,838 --> 00:52:10,872
Do I have the right to speak at all?

561
00:52:11,036 --> 00:52:13,114
I just don't believe in waiting.

562
00:52:13,293 --> 00:52:16,395
I also learned something about funerals.
The hard way.

563
00:52:17,215 --> 00:52:19,566
Yes of course.

564
00:52:20,473 --> 00:52:21,730
Okay.

565
00:52:29,842 --> 00:52:32,292
Oh, God, that's not a good idea.

566
00:52:33,284 --> 00:52:36,097
- Hold on...
- Oh, I'm getting up, I'm getting up...

567
00:52:36,189 --> 00:52:38,235
I have to skate alone.

568
00:52:38,370 --> 00:52:41,223
- Let's see if this is a great idea...
- All right.

569
00:52:41,325 --> 00:52:44,816
I'll keep you light,
until you take it alone

570
00:52:44,897 --> 00:52:46,710
I hold your hand.

571
00:52:46,939 --> 00:52:49,212
We may be in a bit of a hurry,

572
00:52:49,242 --> 00:52:51,437
if you get it.

573
00:52:51,796 --> 00:52:55,129
- How was high school?
- It was not a very good experience.

574
00:52:55,229 --> 00:52:59,347
You couldn't come out?!
Well, it wasn't me - him!

575
00:52:59,435 --> 00:53:01,730
It was great for a while.

576
00:53:01,803 --> 00:53:06,265
- Someone after him?
- Of course. Homophobes, heterosexual...

577
00:53:06,375 --> 00:53:08,124
All the wrong choice.

578
00:53:08,229 --> 00:53:11,622
- Hello?!
- Oh, well, well, well...

579
00:53:11,635 --> 00:53:14,065
Does not apply to attendees.

580
00:53:14,311 --> 00:53:17,912
Because I, on the other hand,
I can pick them well.

581
00:53:41,818 --> 00:53:44,767
- Watch out.
- The gremlin's lair.

582
00:53:45,300 --> 00:53:47,576
Oh, hello. Who is this?

583
00:53:47,591 --> 00:53:50,817
This is Samson or Sam in short.

584
00:53:51,302 --> 00:53:54,062
Hello. Oh, you mean
hello?

585
00:53:56,828 --> 00:53:58,249
Say hello.

586
00:53:58,749 --> 00:54:00,749
May have passed his exam.

587
00:54:00,951 --> 00:54:04,478
- Now let's feed him.
- I will not bother you.

588
00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:11,946
Biographies?!

589
00:54:13,790 --> 00:54:17,013
Creators, poets...

590
00:54:17,976 --> 00:54:19,465
Serial killers.

591
00:54:20,904 --> 00:54:23,708
Hitler. I've read this book too.

592
00:54:25,615 --> 00:54:29,767
- What a coincidence.
- I like to read about people's lives.

593
00:54:36,530 --> 00:54:38,827
Oh, of those tiny bottles.

594
00:54:38,835 --> 00:54:41,569
Tiny bottles
are very comfortable.

595
00:54:41,645 --> 00:54:44,636
It's good that you get all this stuff
for free.

596
00:54:44,675 --> 00:54:47,143
No, it's not safe for free.

597
00:54:47,503 --> 00:54:51,161
Promise me the sheets and pillows
will be from the airline.

598
00:54:54,483 --> 00:54:57,769
Let's drink about it...
and a new friendship.

599
00:54:58,122 --> 00:54:59,223
Cheers.

600
00:55:08,409 --> 00:55:11,625
- Explain to me why you are still alone.
- I'm not.

601
00:55:12,751 --> 00:55:16,023
I have Sam. He never leaves me alone.

602
00:55:16,562 --> 00:55:19,896
- I don't like loneliness.
- Seriously.

603
00:55:21,122 --> 00:55:22,598
Steward.

604
00:55:22,700 --> 00:55:25,145
You're gone for days. You sleep every night
n different bed.

605
00:55:25,323 --> 00:55:28,377
This does not inspire confidence in anyone
boyfriend, a human being.

606
00:55:29,757 --> 00:55:31,725
I can handle it.

607
00:55:33,874 --> 00:55:35,787
To keep things... fresh...

608
00:55:40,798 --> 00:55:42,331
It's not so bad...

609
00:55:44,428 --> 00:55:45,841
Not for me.

610
00:55:46,951 --> 00:55:49,239
I wanted to tell you personally.

611
00:56:12,451 --> 00:56:15,513
- Sleeping pillows?!
- They won't help you much.

612
00:56:42,734 --> 00:56:45,273
- You're driving me crazy.
- Right?

613
00:57:09,883 --> 00:57:12,424
And how is morning #3?

614
00:57:13,700 --> 00:57:16,300
So I never want to leave.

615
00:57:20,142 --> 00:57:24,767
Then... why don't we make it official.

616
00:57:25,388 --> 00:57:28,288
Given, let's become "officially" boyfriends.

617
00:57:29,957 --> 00:57:30,957
You're cute.

618
00:57:32,607 --> 00:57:35,396
I don't know if I do
I'm a boyfriend material.

619
00:57:35,532 --> 00:57:37,486
Why don't you let me judge.

620
00:57:37,716 --> 00:57:40,116
I'm older and smarter, remember?

621
00:57:41,477 --> 00:57:42,664
That's what you say.

622
00:57:44,355 --> 00:57:46,317
It was easy for you.

623
00:57:47,938 --> 00:57:49,820
Because I'm a steward?

624
00:57:54,605 --> 00:57:56,776
Maybe this restrains you?

625
00:58:10,100 --> 00:58:12,156
Will you fly to Austin?

626
00:58:14,046 --> 00:58:15,208
No way.

627
00:58:16,987 --> 00:58:21,292
I'm thinking of transferring there
next semester.

628
00:58:23,782 --> 00:58:26,196
It even scares me a little.

629
00:58:29,513 --> 00:58:32,163
You tell me this move
will I be startled and run away?

630
00:58:34,260 --> 00:58:35,260
Why?

631
00:58:37,723 --> 00:58:39,923
Do what you have to do.

632
00:58:40,636 --> 00:58:41,916
We will invent something.

633
00:58:44,217 --> 00:58:46,560
Got it? God, you're great.

634
00:58:52,528 --> 00:58:54,934
- Because of the exams?
- They are today.

635
00:58:54,954 --> 00:58:56,094
Hi, woman

636
00:58:56,165 --> 00:58:59,033
You are forbidden to rejoice,
when I'm so sad.

637
00:58:59,077 --> 00:59:01,092
Then you need a drink, if so.

638
00:59:01,183 --> 00:59:04,159
- I'm sick of listening to you...
- She needs that...

639
00:59:04,167 --> 00:59:07,254
- Hello?! "She" is right here.
- And the weekend is set...

640
00:59:07,312 --> 00:59:09,071
Will you join us?

641
00:59:09,087 --> 00:59:12,706
You have no exclusive rights
this weekend.

642
00:59:16,633 --> 00:59:19,500
He is waiting this weekend,
so come on!

643
00:59:19,557 --> 00:59:21,669
Blowing it... dear.

644
00:59:21,675 --> 00:59:23,135
Yes, I'll blow it!

645
00:59:27,177 --> 00:59:29,325
- Hi, Anthony.
- Hi, Vako.

646
00:59:29,751 --> 00:59:32,500
Vako is wrong because
his boyfriend is not here.

647
00:59:32,658 --> 00:59:36,871
I wanted to call you last night, but that's it
turned into a nightmarish night.

648
00:59:36,945 --> 00:59:38,600
You had to work,
as I understand.

649
00:59:38,704 --> 00:59:42,064
No, but my sister is out of town
and I had to take care of Sam.

650
00:59:42,265 --> 00:59:45,991
- Yes, you've been terribly busy.
- Come on, you love Sam.

651
00:59:46,702 --> 00:59:49,751
But I also love my boyfriend,
which I have not seen in a month.

652
00:59:49,806 --> 00:59:52,179
- Let me explain...
- We'll talk later, okay?

653
00:59:55,251 --> 00:59:56,251
What?

654
00:59:56,376 --> 00:59:58,196
Damn it. It was rough.

655
00:59:58,290 --> 01:00:00,845
Didn't you have to drink beer somewhere?

656
01:00:01,722 --> 01:00:04,199
Do not worry. I'll call you
later.

657
01:00:10,514 --> 01:00:13,847
Well, sure enough
ruin my surprise, huh?

658
01:00:14,200 --> 01:00:17,778
- I'm such an idiot.
- Fortunately, I'm the best boy in the world.

659
01:00:21,961 --> 01:00:24,773
Wait! Does this surprise mean...

660
01:00:25,027 --> 01:00:27,988
- what I want?
- Oh, I'm here, aren't I?

661
01:00:28,307 --> 01:00:31,689
This is technically no surprise, because
you friend always surprise me.

662
01:00:35,515 --> 01:00:37,255
I'm moving to Austin.

663
01:00:39,236 --> 01:00:42,423
Which means I moved to Austin.
I have an apartment in Clarksville.

664
01:00:43,148 --> 01:00:47,623
- And you were going to tell me when?
- Today, before you hang up my phone.

665
01:00:49,418 --> 01:00:52,961
- Yes, I'm sorry.
- And after he apologized...

666
01:00:53,534 --> 01:00:55,891
- I have one last surprised.
- Oh, I don't deserve this...

667
01:00:55,916 --> 01:00:59,448
No, you don't deserve it, but I love you
anyway.

668
01:01:04,867 --> 01:01:07,062
Paris. During Christmas break.

669
01:01:13,770 --> 01:01:16,801
- I was so bad with you...
- Yes, it was.

670
01:01:17,873 --> 01:01:20,294
So you owe me a favor.

671
01:01:20,837 --> 01:01:22,532
Whatever.

672
01:01:24,173 --> 01:01:27,004
I'll choose when. For whatever it is.

673
01:02:25,547 --> 01:02:27,617
- Here we are.
- Here?

674
01:02:27,703 --> 01:02:29,742
Does this "duck" mean?

675
01:02:30,258 --> 01:02:32,890
- Fox.
- Mmmm, go.

676
01:02:49,715 --> 01:02:52,199
- Welcome, gentlemen.
- Thanks.

677
01:02:55,213 --> 01:02:57,759
- This one?
- Yes, especially for us.

678
01:03:15,521 --> 01:03:17,442
Did he say Texas?

679
01:03:17,847 --> 01:03:21,800
I think in French that means
that I want my promise right now.

680
01:03:22,413 --> 01:03:25,990
- What?
- Are you scared?

681
01:03:45,694 --> 01:03:47,835
I'm sorry.

682
01:05:51,082 --> 01:05:52,946
Are you okay?

683
01:06:01,665 --> 01:06:04,786
<i>One year later</i>

684
01:06:06,995 --> 01:06:10,494
Honestly Tim, you have to move
from Jace, officially.

685
01:06:10,514 --> 01:06:12,068
I have a great roommate,

686
01:06:12,107 --> 01:06:15,638
I only have two months left,
before for a taste of the real world.

687
01:06:15,646 --> 01:06:18,317
Exactly. Jace is your real world.

688
01:06:18,357 --> 01:06:21,167
You are, anyway, constantly
together. I am only...

689
01:06:21,391 --> 01:06:24,374
- interfering roommate.
- Is that important?

690
01:06:26,160 --> 01:06:30,091
- What?
- Yes, the real world. Do not interrupt me...

691
01:06:30,170 --> 01:06:33,252
- What is tight?
- Oh, God, don't turn!

692
01:06:33,552 --> 01:06:35,255
Benjamin!

693
01:06:38,158 --> 01:06:41,140
- I... Are you really?
- Yes...

694
01:06:42,737 --> 01:06:44,736
Are you visiting?

695
01:06:45,055 --> 01:06:48,471
- I study here.
- I thought you were in Chicago.

696
01:06:50,624 --> 01:06:52,444
I have to go.

697
01:06:58,688 --> 01:07:00,164
Benjamin, wait!

698
01:07:04,733 --> 01:07:07,535
- What do you want?
- I don't know, let's talk, I guess.

699
01:07:09,068 --> 01:07:10,216
I can not.

700
01:07:10,531 --> 01:07:13,351
Look, I know you're mad at me.
I'll get out of your way, but...

701
01:07:15,005 --> 01:07:19,165
Here, take this. I'll call you one
in the evening and we can... communicate a little.

702
01:07:19,957 --> 01:07:24,168
- How do you know I'm not going to throw it away?
- I'm leaving now.

703
01:07:26,528 --> 01:07:27,941
Wait.

704
01:07:28,868 --> 01:07:30,374
On one condition.

705
01:07:31,101 --> 01:07:33,234
Your sketchbook. Let me look at it.

706
01:07:45,671 --> 01:07:47,071
He was right, Benjamin.

707
01:07:49,783 --> 01:07:51,259
For which?

708
01:07:51,672 --> 01:07:53,214
For many things.

709
01:07:55,217 --> 01:07:57,224
Give me back the sketch later.

710
01:08:08,333 --> 01:08:10,503
Your standard is standard!

711
01:08:18,425 --> 01:08:23,381
Last year we were in one class
in chemistry. It took him a lot to recognize me.

712
01:08:23,728 --> 01:08:25,188
And then what?

713
01:08:25,488 --> 01:08:27,738
Tim, he asked about you...

714
01:08:27,821 --> 01:08:30,438
where are you, how do you drive her...

715
01:08:31,349 --> 01:08:32,349
And you said...

716
01:08:32,609 --> 01:08:37,301
I told him I'm in Chicago, but I didn't
met a year after that.

717
01:08:38,702 --> 01:08:40,913
What should he do if he calls?

718
01:08:41,636 --> 01:08:42,737
Think of Jace.

719
01:08:42,936 --> 01:08:45,951
Oh my God. Not like having sex on the phone
with him.

720
01:08:47,930 --> 01:08:49,031
What?

721
01:08:49,527 --> 01:08:52,518
- What?
- I... I think...

722
01:08:53,902 --> 01:08:57,189
that he has something, for example
like a little uncle.

723
01:08:57,214 --> 01:08:59,270
No no no. No!

724
01:08:59,295 --> 01:09:03,193
- What exactly do you mean?
- Someone older and flush with money.

725
01:09:03,974 --> 01:09:05,223
Luxury.

726
01:09:05,276 --> 01:09:07,308
Probably bidding money.

727
01:09:07,388 --> 01:09:09,323
Do you think a guy with his ass,

728
01:09:09,348 --> 01:09:13,092
will hang with a rich old man,
just because of his personality?

729
01:09:27,313 --> 01:09:29,469
- Hello?
<i>- How is it?</i>

730
01:09:30,086 --> 01:09:32,956
Okay... uh... thank you.

731
01:09:33,106 --> 01:09:34,706
<i>Thanks for picking me up.</i>

732
01:09:36,241 --> 01:09:37,811
Where are you?

733
01:09:37,995 --> 01:09:40,112
<i>- I... had...</i>
- No.

734
01:09:40,672 --> 01:09:46,061
No, Tim. I mean, where was he?

735
01:09:50,034 --> 01:09:52,502
<i>Lord, five years is a long time, huh?</i>

736
01:09:52,831 --> 01:09:54,557
Yes, something like that.

737
01:09:56,416 --> 01:09:59,891
<i>Look, I'll answer every question,
who you want. With you.</i>

738
01:10:02,054 --> 01:10:04,147
<i>Come on, face to face.</i>

739
01:10:05,347 --> 01:10:06,823
I do not think so.

740
01:10:07,332 --> 01:10:09,762
<i>Why? Aren't you dressed?</i>

741
01:10:10,267 --> 01:10:13,326
<i>You lie in your bed alone
shorts.</i>

742
01:10:14,334 --> 01:10:16,561
Benjamin Bentley, did you train?

743
01:10:17,895 --> 01:10:20,263
God, what the...

744
01:10:21,431 --> 01:10:23,688
What are you doing here? How did you find me?

745
01:10:24,649 --> 01:10:28,439
I found Alison in the phone book.

746
01:10:28,959 --> 01:10:30,349
Come on!

747
01:10:43,737 --> 01:10:45,190
Don't relax.

748
01:10:46,413 --> 01:10:47,413
Come in.

749
01:10:56,614 --> 01:10:59,301
Does that mean I can't
to start getting to know you?

750
01:10:59,744 --> 01:11:01,438
It is not a good idea.

751
01:11:04,187 --> 01:11:05,866
Come with me for dinner.

752
01:11:08,006 --> 01:11:11,406
I'm not going anywhere before I get it
some answers.

753
01:11:12,208 --> 01:11:13,505
Okay.

754
01:11:15,061 --> 01:11:16,498
Five years ago...

755
01:11:17,697 --> 01:11:19,524
I went to Garrose for a year...

756
01:11:20,762 --> 01:11:22,296
to run away from you...

757
01:11:22,557 --> 01:11:23,728
from Bryce...

758
01:11:24,404 --> 01:11:25,583
by all.

759
01:11:26,365 --> 01:11:28,031
And by myself, including.

760
01:11:29,442 --> 01:11:32,442
- Are you heterosexual in Austin?
- Not exactly hetero.

761
01:11:33,341 --> 01:11:35,310
It's easier to be gay here.

762
01:11:36,997 --> 01:11:38,651
Wait. Are you gay now?

763
01:11:38,690 --> 01:11:43,289
Just sleeping with some guys
to navigate, but yes.

764
01:11:45,734 --> 01:11:47,515
And your parents?

765
01:11:48,276 --> 01:11:50,143
They are no longer in my life.

766
01:11:53,861 --> 01:11:55,642
What about you?

767
01:11:57,815 --> 01:12:01,312
Chicago was just... was it a lie?
Keep me away?

768
01:12:01,916 --> 01:12:04,669
No. I was there the first year.

769
01:12:05,021 --> 01:12:06,286
Daddy?

770
01:12:13,846 --> 01:12:17,564
This is Jace. We are together
for a year and a half.

771
01:12:23,415 --> 01:12:25,548
I guess I deserve it.

772
01:12:26,799 --> 01:12:29,181
I was thinking of seducing you tonight.

773
01:12:32,600 --> 01:12:34,927
I told myself I would do anything
to bring you back.

774
01:12:35,490 --> 01:12:38,451
- Now I'm kind of... ashamed.
- Tim... Tim, I...

775
01:12:40,368 --> 01:12:42,369
I'm glad to see you again...

776
01:12:43,301 --> 01:12:45,012
but I'm afraid of you.

777
01:12:46,372 --> 01:12:48,582
This is new territory for me.

778
01:12:50,047 --> 01:12:53,882
So... you want me to drive it slow.

779
01:12:54,724 --> 01:12:55,840
Okay.

780
01:12:56,726 --> 01:12:58,312
We'll drive it slow.

781
01:12:59,398 --> 01:13:00,694
Until recently.

782
01:13:15,265 --> 01:13:20,481
Okay, Ali knew all the time,
that Tim was studying here and she said nothing.

783
01:13:20,540 --> 01:13:22,830
Maybe she just tried
to protect you.

784
01:13:23,081 --> 01:13:26,105
- I'm a big boy.
- How would I know.

785
01:13:30,102 --> 01:13:32,993
I called him to return his sketchbook.

786
01:13:35,083 --> 01:13:38,482
So... so you're planning
should I meet Tim?

787
01:13:38,935 --> 01:13:40,651
I hope so.

788
01:13:41,044 --> 01:13:42,863
I told him you weren't at work today.

789
01:13:42,910 --> 01:13:45,175
Okay. I just think it's important

790
01:13:45,214 --> 01:13:47,362
he should look at the two of us as a couple.

791
01:13:48,605 --> 01:13:51,191
Are you jealous, Jace Holdon?

792
01:13:52,803 --> 01:13:56,084
Speaking of now,
I also had a similar problem.

793
01:13:58,151 --> 01:13:59,151
Lets hear.

794
01:13:59,409 --> 01:14:01,525
Uh... about 6 months ago...

795
01:14:01,900 --> 01:14:05,025
on the flight to Boston, she was nervous
a traveler named Erin.

796
01:14:05,892 --> 01:14:09,220
It was... sweet... a younger boy...

797
01:14:09,645 --> 01:14:13,582
but he was terrible and had to hold
his hand throughout the flight.

798
01:14:14,398 --> 01:14:16,272
I don't think I know him.

799
01:14:17,779 --> 01:14:21,021
Well, when we landed, he invited me
get me a drink.

800
01:14:23,305 --> 01:14:27,445
- And you... you... are gone.
- Almost...

801
01:14:30,216 --> 01:14:32,950
Even when I mentioned you,
he was still trying to kiss me.

802
01:14:33,442 --> 01:14:36,816
And he was really sexy,
I won't lie...

803
01:14:36,894 --> 01:14:39,027
I definitely wanted it, but...

804
01:14:40,371 --> 01:14:42,588
I made my choice,
that I want you

805
01:14:44,468 --> 01:14:46,201
And didn't you?

806
01:14:47,153 --> 01:14:48,793
I didn't.

807
01:14:50,442 --> 01:14:55,461
But part of me wanted it. And you can
to try to understand me.

808
01:14:58,166 --> 01:15:00,150
I'm just old-fashioned.

809
01:15:01,074 --> 01:15:03,035
And I only want you.

810
01:15:03,694 --> 01:15:05,217
And I believe you.

811
01:15:08,537 --> 01:15:09,873
Delivery.

812
01:15:15,040 --> 01:15:18,017
Pizza! You have to be Jace?!

813
01:15:19,189 --> 01:15:23,822
- And you're probably Mister Abercombie.
- I'm Tim. Nice to meet you.

814
01:15:23,839 --> 01:15:25,812
Tim! What a surprise!

815
01:15:26,230 --> 01:15:28,979
Hey, I decided we could all be
friends... with pizza.

816
01:15:30,041 --> 01:15:31,923
Or Thai food?

817
01:15:33,761 --> 01:15:36,441
God! This is Italian!

818
01:15:37,429 --> 01:15:39,342
- Italian!
- Italian!

819
01:15:41,280 --> 01:15:44,428
- Look at this place!
- That's good, isn't it?

820
01:15:52,674 --> 01:15:56,174
He took my crutches and left me
on the beach with those girls.

821
01:15:56,189 --> 01:15:58,135
Who are the girls? Those you flirt with?

822
01:15:58,143 --> 01:16:00,580
Yes, but someone else helped me,
after escaping.

823
01:16:00,831 --> 01:16:04,588
- I don't want to remember that.
- Some welding happened there.

824
01:16:04,975 --> 01:16:09,001
Benjamin! A gay man who doesn't understand
about cars, just hit the jackpot!

825
01:16:10,659 --> 01:16:12,393
I heard you do too.

826
01:16:13,546 --> 01:16:15,506
I understand what you're really asking.

827
01:16:18,931 --> 01:16:20,407
His name is Eric.

828
01:16:21,447 --> 01:16:23,072
He was a friend.

829
01:16:24,148 --> 01:16:26,289
He died last year
and bequeaths everything to me.

830
01:16:28,327 --> 01:16:29,801
I'm sorry.

831
01:16:31,068 --> 01:16:33,841
But it's a little unusual...

832
01:16:34,033 --> 01:16:35,915
to inherit so much money...

833
01:16:36,052 --> 01:16:37,982
by a friend, I mean.

834
01:16:38,706 --> 01:16:41,018
- Right?
- Yes.

835
01:16:42,268 --> 01:16:44,862
Unless he was your uncle
or something like that...

836
01:16:46,834 --> 01:16:50,545
So... Alison told you
all the gossip.

837
01:16:51,716 --> 01:16:55,582
Eric was old, rich and gay and I should
to be his toy boy?

838
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:57,546
I don't know, Tim.

839
01:16:57,722 --> 01:16:59,581
This is nonsense.

840
01:16:59,642 --> 01:17:02,822
Eric was a good person and also the best
a friend I once had.

841
01:17:06,673 --> 01:17:10,063
- Didn't he try to do something.
- Oh, try.

842
01:17:13,158 --> 01:17:14,720
But I don't, however.

843
01:17:17,227 --> 01:17:18,945
Did he want to?

844
01:17:20,725 --> 01:17:23,428
Sometimes you can't tell a friend,
that you love him.

845
01:17:28,161 --> 01:17:31,905
I want to tell a friend like him.
And like you, Benjamin.

846
01:17:32,539 --> 01:17:34,905
And now I want to be a friend
with both of you.

847
01:17:37,334 --> 01:17:39,232
If you give me a chance.

848
01:17:51,102 --> 01:17:54,723
Sorry, Tim's out of town,
and Benjamin teaches.

849
01:17:54,741 --> 01:17:56,952
And when they're out of town I want...

850
01:18:00,110 --> 01:18:02,195
Tim and Jace get along well.

851
01:18:02,739 --> 01:18:04,762
No, it's not.

852
01:18:05,507 --> 01:18:08,436
Okay, fine, I promise, lunch on Sunday.

853
01:18:08,713 --> 01:18:10,518
I will come. I love you.

854
01:18:10,590 --> 01:18:12,738
I have to close.
I have to close!

855
01:18:24,375 --> 01:18:26,857
Are you Jace's roommate
or something like that?

856
01:18:26,988 --> 01:18:29,057
No, I'm his boyfriend.

857
01:18:29,596 --> 01:18:31,252
Yes, great!

858
01:18:31,308 --> 01:18:34,331
Believe it yourself.
Look to get my note.

859
01:18:44,231 --> 01:18:46,183
Hey, are you ready for dinner?

860
01:18:48,100 --> 01:18:50,559
- They left you a note.
- A note?

861
01:18:51,689 --> 01:18:53,313
Read it!

862
01:19:15,970 --> 01:19:18,431
Benji, is that a joke?

863
01:19:18,687 --> 01:19:22,374
<i>You didn't expect to see me that soon.
My parents reached out for a ticket.</i>

864
01:19:22,527 --> 01:19:26,229
- Where was last week? In Boston?
- Yes and what?

865
01:19:28,099 --> 01:19:30,286
You think it's... No!

866
01:19:30,447 --> 01:19:33,612
This kid didn't write it.
I haven't even seen it since.

867
01:19:33,624 --> 01:19:34,716
Since when?

868
01:19:34,740 --> 01:19:38,065
How about: "What did we do in this
hotel room! It still hurts my ass.".

869
01:19:38,101 --> 01:19:40,468
- "With love, Erin".
- Nothing has happened.

870
01:19:41,052 --> 01:19:42,216
It is...

871
01:19:42,626 --> 01:19:44,641
I don't even know what that is.

872
01:19:44,925 --> 01:19:46,378
I'm not a fool, Jace.

873
01:19:46,612 --> 01:19:49,034
I've never cheated on you.

874
01:19:49,815 --> 01:19:51,306
What is this?

875
01:19:53,568 --> 01:19:56,063
- Tim.
- Oh, tight Jace!

876
01:19:56,086 --> 01:19:57,765
I saw the kid at our door.

877
01:19:57,773 --> 01:19:59,578
I'm damn sure
that it wasn't Tim.

878
01:19:59,592 --> 01:20:03,262
I don't know what's going on, but if anyone is
under suspicion, it's you.

879
01:20:03,270 --> 01:20:06,059
I was completely honest about mine
friendship with Tim

880
01:20:06,065 --> 01:20:07,181
Friendship?

881
01:20:07,218 --> 01:20:11,457
Are you kidding? I see the way
looks at you when I'm right there.

882
01:20:11,504 --> 01:20:14,510
- Asking you to give him a chance...
- I get the whole picture, okay?

883
01:20:14,553 --> 01:20:17,153
I trust you Ben, I don't blame you...

884
01:20:49,026 --> 01:20:50,268
Benjamin!

885
01:20:53,580 --> 01:20:55,548
I think he's cheating on me.

886
01:20:56,341 --> 01:20:57,793
Do you have anything to do with it?

887
01:20:57,954 --> 01:20:59,833
What? No! What happened?

888
01:20:59,958 --> 01:21:02,188
I was hurt, that's what I'm saying.

889
01:21:03,647 --> 01:21:05,983
He was there in front of the apartment and...

890
01:21:06,007 --> 01:21:08,967
leave a note, Jace denies
I do not know either...

891
01:21:09,725 --> 01:21:11,523
I don’t know what is going on...

892
01:21:11,664 --> 01:21:14,901
Everything is fine. I'll get a beer
and you will tell me what happened.

893
01:21:28,805 --> 01:21:31,687
- I'll take off your pants...
- Well dear.

894
01:21:35,406 --> 01:21:38,156
- I don't want you to sleep with your jeans.
- Mmm...

895
01:21:39,429 --> 01:21:41,600
The Japanese used it as a torture.

896
01:21:54,278 --> 01:21:56,675
I'll always be there for you, Benjamin.

897
01:22:19,817 --> 01:22:21,558
You're awesome.

898
01:22:23,910 --> 01:22:25,573
He was faint.

899
01:22:28,778 --> 01:22:31,159
I'm sorry I blamed you.

900
01:22:35,723 --> 01:22:37,458
Are you calm now?

901
01:22:38,590 --> 01:22:40,974
Well well. Hey.

902
01:22:41,045 --> 01:22:43,849
I'm just a friend,
who supports you. Remember?

903
01:22:51,461 --> 01:22:53,128
We'll put you to bed...

904
01:23:37,851 --> 01:23:38,851
Echo?

905
01:23:42,252 --> 01:23:43,392
Tim?

906
01:24:07,929 --> 01:24:09,936
You're not a gay pursuer,
you know this.

907
01:24:12,036 --> 01:24:13,036
Hello.

908
01:24:14,128 --> 01:24:15,877
I was... uh...

909
01:24:17,925 --> 01:24:18,925
I would...

910
01:24:28,374 --> 01:24:31,788
If I want something from you is to
you practice honesty.

911
01:25:43,566 --> 01:25:45,237
You've been busy.

912
01:26:00,786 --> 01:26:02,106
Eric?

913
01:26:05,144 --> 01:26:06,144
Yes.

914
01:26:17,047 --> 01:26:18,047
He is...

915
01:26:20,731 --> 01:26:22,082
He is...

916
01:26:23,492 --> 01:26:24,492
beautiful.

917
01:27:04,402 --> 01:27:08,056
Hey what are you doing?
Stop it, stop it, stop it...

918
01:27:15,343 --> 01:27:17,014
I slept with Tim.

919
01:27:17,620 --> 01:27:19,151
I knew it!

920
01:27:19,224 --> 01:27:20,845
As soon as he told me,
that you will pay,

921
01:27:20,869 --> 01:27:23,158
I realized you did something stupid.

922
01:27:23,184 --> 01:27:26,847
- "Stupid" is too much.
- How about: "Have you lost your mind?!".

923
01:27:28,140 --> 01:27:31,359
- Better "stupid".
- I do not understand. What about Jace?

924
01:27:32,172 --> 01:27:34,261
I do not know. He's in Chicago.

925
01:27:34,835 --> 01:27:36,464
Do you still love him?

926
01:27:36,504 --> 01:27:39,196
- Yes of course...
- You have to deal with him.

927
01:27:39,232 --> 01:27:42,368
and put a distance between you
and your past.

928
01:27:42,400 --> 01:27:45,220
Tim is not my past.
Yeah he hurt me before, but...

929
01:27:46,675 --> 01:27:48,558
I love it.

930
01:27:48,864 --> 01:27:51,941
And it's probably stupid...
I can't explain why, but...

931
01:27:52,418 --> 01:27:53,792
I love it.

932
01:27:54,033 --> 01:27:56,527
Yes, but you can't have both.

933
01:27:57,044 --> 01:28:00,495
If Ronnie Adams walks in the door now,

934
01:28:00,666 --> 01:28:02,603
my heart will leap.

935
01:28:02,926 --> 01:28:04,926
But we have a chance, right?

936
01:28:04,993 --> 01:28:07,578
Life went on.
Except for Tim.

937
01:28:07,603 --> 01:28:08,984
It's different for me.

938
01:28:09,138 --> 01:28:10,138
Excuse.

939
01:28:10,416 --> 01:28:14,159
See. You and the rest of the world
you see the spoiled, arrogant athlete.

940
01:28:14,821 --> 01:28:17,082
I see the boy whose parents
they were giving him trouble,

941
01:28:17,082 --> 01:28:18,988
they didn't realize how talented he was,

942
01:28:19,052 --> 01:28:22,645
he is brilliant who showed me
that he needs me.

943
01:28:22,920 --> 01:28:25,614
Yeah, I know Jace loves me and stuff, but...

944
01:28:26,542 --> 01:28:27,839
we are still together...

945
01:28:28,129 --> 01:28:31,410
he was fine when we met,
he will be fine also if we break.

946
01:28:33,827 --> 01:28:35,256
Flat.

947
01:28:35,880 --> 01:28:38,661
Flat. Ben...

948
01:28:39,748 --> 01:28:40,748
Ben.

949
01:28:41,908 --> 01:28:43,931
Everything will be fine, Allison.

950
01:28:58,979 --> 01:29:00,908
- Do you go to school here?
- Leave me alone!

951
01:29:00,948 --> 01:29:03,329
You're not from the countryside.
You study here.

952
01:29:03,465 --> 01:29:04,667
I get out of here.

953
01:29:04,701 --> 01:29:06,704
You guys decide
threesome problem.

954
01:29:06,729 --> 01:29:08,455
- Benjamin, wait?
- Enough lies, Tim.

955
01:29:08,562 --> 01:29:10,617
I was stupid enough to believe you.

956
01:29:10,997 --> 01:29:13,036
And now, I lost the Jays.

957
01:29:13,106 --> 01:29:16,347
I told you I would do anything
to bring you back.

958
01:29:17,978 --> 01:29:19,811
- You wanted to believe.
- No!

959
01:29:19,811 --> 01:29:21,061
You wanted this relation...

960
01:29:21,095 --> 01:29:24,587
No, I had to realize he never did
will not fall for someone like this!

961
01:29:25,198 --> 01:29:27,908
Why would you think that?
Because of you!

962
01:29:28,840 --> 01:29:30,660
What's wrong with us?

963
01:29:31,311 --> 01:29:34,030
My life is so fucked up
when you show up.

964
01:29:34,684 --> 01:29:37,923
- What else is left between us?
- A lot. Trust me.

965
01:29:39,303 --> 01:29:41,357
You're a damn coward.

966
01:29:57,702 --> 01:29:59,238
Congratulations!

967
01:30:01,023 --> 01:30:04,284
It's for your own good. Talk about it.

968
01:30:05,423 --> 01:30:07,189
I'm going to the party.

969
01:30:12,739 --> 01:30:14,192
Congratulations, Ben.

970
01:30:26,620 --> 01:30:28,409
I want you in my life, Ben.

971
01:30:30,826 --> 01:30:32,530
- I can not...
- I need you.

972
01:30:40,188 --> 01:30:41,867
I slept with Tim.

973
01:30:46,421 --> 01:30:47,867
No...

974
01:30:50,792 --> 01:30:53,533
You... sometimes you do things...

975
01:30:56,084 --> 01:30:57,794
You have to hate me.

976
01:31:00,508 --> 01:31:01,508
No...

977
01:31:03,647 --> 01:31:05,694
Look, that would be very easy.

978
01:31:07,887 --> 01:31:10,821
I had enough faith that we would fix it
things between us

979
01:31:10,869 --> 01:31:12,860
before you run to Tim's bed.

980
01:31:20,022 --> 01:31:21,584
I've always admired...

981
01:31:21,882 --> 01:31:24,777
of your courage to go out
in the 9th grade light.

982
01:31:26,214 --> 01:31:27,651
Seriously.

983
01:31:30,759 --> 01:31:33,142
But when it comes to proving,
who are you really...

984
01:31:34,366 --> 01:31:36,716
it turns out that was the last one
a real risk you took.

985
01:31:36,741 --> 01:31:38,601
So much, you were so scared of...

986
01:31:41,257 --> 01:31:42,675
everything.

987
01:31:58,020 --> 01:31:59,520
I'll do it.

988
01:32:07,027 --> 01:32:08,027
Excuse me...

989
01:32:11,709 --> 01:32:14,449
- Ben, what are you doing here?
- I need to talk to you.

990
01:32:14,575 --> 01:32:17,169
Even if I have to travel all the way
to Chicago to do it.

991
01:32:17,632 --> 01:32:19,272
Hi Jace.

992
01:32:19,318 --> 01:32:22,708
Hi Allison, people are waiting
queued up to board.

993
01:32:26,688 --> 01:32:28,959
Choose: Sit or get off the plane.

994
01:32:29,054 --> 01:32:31,069
We'll sit down. Thanks.

995
01:32:40,174 --> 01:32:43,114
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome
aboard the United Airways.

996
01:32:43,182 --> 01:32:46,954
Please walk down the aisle and sit down
in your places as fast as you can.

997
01:32:55,438 --> 01:32:57,868
Look, I don't know what
you're doing here, but I...

998
01:33:05,713 --> 01:33:07,107

01:34:36,209 --> 01:34:37,739
Okay.

1023
01:34:38,970 --> 01:34:40,485
Okay.

1024
01:36:53,858 --> 01:36:56,520
You really liked last night?

1025
01:36:57,533 --> 01:36:59,813
I spend them all.

1026
01:37:01,724 --> 01:37:03,426
Again a headache?

1027
01:37:04,699 --> 01:37:06,293
Do you want coffee?

1028
01:37:06,504 --> 01:37:10,347
You're kidding, would you bring me some aspirin?

1029
01:37:21,689 --> 01:37:23,680
- Are you okay?
- Mmm.

1030
01:37:39,599 --> 01:37:40,935
Honey.

1031
01:37:41,256 --> 01:37:42,560
Jace!

1032
01:39:18,428 --> 01:39:19,756
Are you Ben?

1033
01:39:20,396 --> 01:39:21,700
Yes, Ben Bentley.

1034
01:39:21,810 --> 01:39:25,059
Jace received a brain aneurysm crisis.

1035
01:39:25,348 --> 01:39:27,590
He said his grandmother had died
from an aneurysm.

1036
01:39:27,615 --> 01:39:31,888
We managed to keep one, but the other can
to appear at any moment.

1037
01:39:31,944 --> 01:39:34,958
Too weak for another operation,
If this happens.

1038
01:39:35,228 --> 01:39:38,399
He only offered to those
unexpected circumstances,

1039
01:39:38,619 --> 01:39:40,627
to donate his organs.

1040
01:39:43,378 --> 01:39:44,940
What does this mean?

1041
01:39:45,810 --> 01:39:48,989
That other people will live happy lives
because of him.

1042
01:39:49,761 --> 01:39:52,151
He is very weak but wants to see you.

1043
01:39:54,473 --> 01:39:56,512
Go to him, right?

1044
01:41:49,623 --> 01:41:51,242
Hello dear.

1045
01:41:52,675 --> 01:41:54,237
Good afternoon, son.

1046
01:42:00,944 --> 01:42:06,534
Honey... you're locked in this hotel
from the month. Let's take you home.

1047
01:42:14,850 --> 01:42:16,665
There's nothing left for me, Mom

1048
01:42:21,279 --> 01:42:23,310
The Lord took it from me.

1049
01:42:28,201 --> 01:42:29,716
I hate it for that.

1050
01:42:34,170 --> 01:42:35,724
And he hates me.

1051
01:42:36,140 --> 01:42:37,374
No, dear, no.

1052
01:42:39,760 --> 01:42:41,156
Because I loved him.

1053
01:42:49,641 --> 01:42:51,710
I brought you a fruit cupcake.

1054
01:42:57,524 --> 01:42:59,257
Did you bring me a fruitcake?

1055
01:43:02,008 --> 01:43:04,796
Mom, what am I supposed to do?
with the fruitcake?

1056
01:43:05,429 --> 01:43:08,233
Honey, you can do nothing with it.

1057
01:43:08,560 --> 01:43:12,835
The fruitcake is no good reason.

1058
01:43:13,171 --> 01:43:15,132
Except as an excuse...

1059
01:43:15,696 --> 01:43:17,179
to live.

1060
01:43:18,357 --> 01:43:21,903
And you have thousands of reasons to live.

1061
01:43:32,625 --> 01:43:35,124
<i>Dream boldly, yes!</i>

1062
01:43:35,404 --> 01:43:40,721
<i>You just have to hold your head
high up to the sky.</i>

1063
01:43:41,832 --> 01:43:48,722
<i>If you spread your wings, you can fly.</i>

1064
01:43:49,044 --> 01:43:55,528
<i>Because now is your time
to shine.</i>

1065
01:43:55,904 --> 01:44:02,727
<i>So don't give up on this dream,
thinks you can fly.</i>

1066
01:44:05,866 --> 01:44:08,605
<i>So never give up.</i>

1067
01:44:08,668 --> 01:44:12,382
<i>Supposedly from that
dreams are made.</i>

1068
01:44:12,410 --> 01:44:15,640
<i>This is such a fun situation.</i>

1069
01:44:15,665 --> 01:44:21,779
<i>Nobody sleeps, some dream,
no one says if it will ever come true.</i>

1070
01:44:21,793 --> 01:44:24,391
<i>Dream boldly, yes!</i>

1071
01:44:24,415 --> 01:44:30,524
<i>You just have to hold your head
high up to the sky.</i>

1072
01:44:31,002 --> 01:44:37,318
<i>Just spread your wings and you can fly.</i>

1073
01:44:37,472 --> 01:44:40,254
<i>Hello. This is Ben. Talk!</i>

1074
01:44:40,319 --> 01:44:43,299
<i>Ben, please call me.</i>

1075
01:44:43,390 --> 01:44:45,654

You sound like an elderly uncle.

1097
01:46:31,344 --> 01:46:33,109
Get out of my life!

1098
01:46:34,607 --> 01:46:37,113
- Oh, shit, Alison told you that...
- The language, sir.

1099
01:46:37,148 --> 01:46:38,579
I'm supposed to be your mother.

1100
01:46:38,626 --> 01:46:40,948
- Get out of here!
- We're not going anywhere.

1101
01:46:40,954 --> 01:46:43,542
- Yes, we're out.
- Do what I tell you.

1102
01:46:47,731 --> 01:46:53,103
Listen, Ben, don't give up this time,
because everything is not just perfect.

1103
01:46:55,088 --> 01:46:56,406
I love you.

1104
01:46:56,438 --> 01:47:00,640
Ben, I loved Jace, but it's been years
and your life is not over.

1105
01:47:01,627 --> 01:47:04,834
I... I don't want to go forward.

1106
01:47:04,859 --> 01:47:08,644
The last thing Jace would want
is to stay in one place in his memory.

1107
01:47:09,341 --> 01:47:10,489
No...

1108
01:47:12,044 --> 01:47:13,895
Sorry, I disagree.

1109
01:47:21,811 --> 01:47:23,724
Is this something included?

1110
01:47:24,360 --> 01:47:26,274
Sorry, it was so high.

1111
01:47:28,020 --> 01:47:32,197
Lord, thank you so much
to see you all here tonight.

1112
01:47:32,861 --> 01:47:35,876
I'm pretty clumsy in speeches,
so be understanding.

1113
01:47:37,932 --> 01:47:42,461
The works on display tonight
are the result of 20 years of work.

1114
01:47:45,722 --> 01:47:49,604
I think you've seen "my great"
artwork: Frog floats in a boat.

1115
01:47:50,508 --> 01:47:52,842
I painted it when I was 8 years old

1116
01:47:53,086 --> 01:47:57,002
and I think they understand why I keep it
something for such a long time.

1117
01:47:57,026 --> 01:48:00,705
I owe my creativity
to many people.

1118
01:48:02,327 --> 01:48:05,507
Of models, of course,
Executor Eric Canroy,

1119
01:48:05,941 --> 01:48:08,355
which meant a lot to me.

1120
01:48:08,718 --> 01:48:11,632
He was my father,

1121
01:48:12,022 --> 01:48:15,760
idol and just... so much more.

1122
01:48:18,800 --> 01:48:21,846
And many people, in fact,
have inspired me, but...

1123
01:48:22,091 --> 01:48:24,137
only one kicked me in the ass.

1124
01:48:24,777 --> 01:48:27,394
And he did it hard, and...

1125
01:48:27,920 --> 01:48:30,717
gave me the courage to earn
his art in light

1126
01:48:30,757 --> 01:48:32,491
and put it here.

1127
01:48:32,604 --> 01:48:35,049
I want to note that he actually is
 is here tonight.

1128
01:48:37,838 --> 01:48:42,317
And I would end this weird speech,
thanking him publicly.

1129
01:48:43,678 --> 01:48:45,255
Benjamin Bentley.

1130
01:49:45,762 --> 01:49:49,434
Honestly, everything is true
very, very complicated.

1131
01:49:53,873 --> 01:49:55,403
I know.

1132
01:50:26,777 --> 01:50:34,777
