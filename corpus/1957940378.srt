1
00:00:28,261 --> 00:00:30,330
I don't know.

2
00:00:34,367 --> 00:00:37,137
No, absolutely not.

3
00:00:37,203 --> 00:00:38,647
Because I'm in the
middle of working out!

4
00:00:38,671 --> 00:00:42,308
I'm not gonna just hurry over
there every time you call.

5
00:00:44,244 --> 00:00:47,247
No, I actually ended
up walking most of it.

6
00:00:47,313 --> 00:00:49,783
Turns out, I hate running.

7
00:00:49,849 --> 00:00:53,753
So, yeah, let me finish
up with this, uh, not run

8
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:55,755
and I'll call you when I'm done.

9
00:00:55,822 --> 00:00:57,290
Bye.

10
00:01:25,852 --> 00:01:28,388
Pick up, pick up, pick up.

11
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:45,391
Hi.

12
00:04:01,541 --> 00:04:03,710
Hey! -

13
00:04:03,776 --> 00:04:07,313
-No, no. no.
-Hey! Get away from him!

14
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:09,048
Sorry, I was just...

15
00:04:16,489 --> 00:04:19,292
On the first day, Ms. Collins?

16
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:56,562
You got me a fish?

17
00:04:56,629 --> 00:04:58,498
It's a house arrest
warming gift.

18
00:04:58,564 --> 00:05:00,933
I know you don't like
to be alone, so...

19
00:05:03,069 --> 00:05:05,038
Way to go.

20
00:05:05,104 --> 00:05:09,909
Bri, you live in a multimillion
dollar lake front home.

21
00:05:09,976 --> 00:05:11,878
You have a wine cellar.

22
00:05:11,944 --> 00:05:15,448
Most people would kill
for a life like this.

23
00:05:15,515 --> 00:05:17,417
I know you weren't a big
fan of the plea deal.

24
00:05:17,483 --> 00:05:20,153
-Because I'm innocent.
-Of course you are.

25
00:05:20,219 --> 00:05:23,122
But convincing a jury
is a another story.

26
00:05:23,189 --> 00:05:24,390
I've been a lawyer a while,

27
00:05:24,457 --> 00:05:27,126
and I've seen how
these things can go.

28
00:05:27,193 --> 00:05:30,596
A year of house arrest
is getting off easy.

29
00:05:30,663 --> 00:05:33,032
You could be where
Michael is right now.

30
00:05:35,368 --> 00:05:37,403
Mm.

31
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:40,006
Mm. I know we didn't
have a choice.

32
00:05:40,073 --> 00:05:42,742
I didn't just hire you
because you were my friend.

33
00:05:46,546 --> 00:05:51,451
I hired you because
you are a good lawyer.

34
00:05:52,452 --> 00:05:54,387
Plus, if I were in jail,

35
00:05:54,454 --> 00:05:56,889
who would drink all of
Michael's fancy wine?

36
00:05:56,956 --> 00:05:59,025
Ehh, there she is.

37
00:05:59,092 --> 00:06:02,462
This is a 2005

38
00:06:02,528 --> 00:06:05,131
from the blah-blah-blah
region of Germany.

39
00:06:05,198 --> 00:06:07,834
Now, the interesting
thing about this vintage

40
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:11,104
is that it's guaranteed
to get you drunk.

41
00:06:11,170 --> 00:06:14,841
-Pinky up, bitch. Be classy.
-Oh, yes.

42
00:06:14,907 --> 00:06:17,710
Mm. Earthy.

43
00:06:17,777 --> 00:06:20,179
I'm getting hints
of Elder flower.

44
00:06:20,246 --> 00:06:21,246
Ah.

45
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:22,849
Oh, and a little younger flower.

46
00:06:25,852 --> 00:06:27,286
Ah, you wanna stay tonight?

47
00:06:27,353 --> 00:06:30,490
We can have a slumber party
like we did in college.

48
00:06:30,556 --> 00:06:32,992
Face masks and manicures

49
00:06:33,059 --> 00:06:34,594
and nicer wine.

50
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:36,662
I wish. I can't.

51
00:06:36,729 --> 00:06:38,164
Court in the morning.

52
00:06:39,665 --> 00:06:43,202
This place just gets
so creepy at night.

53
00:06:43,269 --> 00:06:44,537
You'll be fine.

54
00:06:44,604 --> 00:06:46,973
You have a whole year
to get used to it.

55
00:06:48,708 --> 00:06:51,177
What are you gonna do
with all that time anyway?

56
00:07:02,155 --> 00:07:03,956
Hello.

57
00:07:04,023 --> 00:07:06,225
What do you mean
my signal went out?

58
00:07:07,693 --> 00:07:11,364
Okay. I'll head
upstairs right now.

59
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:12,965
Thank you.

60
00:07:38,991 --> 00:07:40,593
Ms. Collins.

61
00:07:42,528 --> 00:07:44,130
Your electronic
monitoring device

62
00:07:44,197 --> 00:07:45,932
is the property of the
State of California.

63
00:07:45,998 --> 00:07:47,733
Removing or tampering
with the device

64
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,869
will activate the
internal microphone

65
00:07:49,936 --> 00:07:52,071
and will result in
additional legal charges.

66
00:07:52,138 --> 00:07:55,308
It's your responsibility to stay
within the allowed perimeter

67
00:07:55,374 --> 00:07:58,311
and keep the monitor
charged at all times.

68
00:07:58,377 --> 00:08:00,146
I remember, Nancy.

69
00:08:02,982 --> 00:08:04,817
-Do you want a cup of coffee?
-No.

70
00:08:04,884 --> 00:08:08,354
- It'll only take a second.
- No, thank you. I'm fine.

71
00:08:08,421 --> 00:08:10,590
House, start coffee.

72
00:08:12,291 --> 00:08:16,028
House, start coffee!

73
00:08:16,095 --> 00:08:19,031
Coffee
will be ready in two minutes.

74
00:08:19,098 --> 00:08:22,668
Ever get used to the
Smart House thing?

75
00:08:22,735 --> 00:08:24,403
I'm trying.

76
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:27,306
It always seems to like my
ex-husband more than me.

77
00:08:27,373 --> 00:08:28,774
Do you want sugar?

78
00:08:28,841 --> 00:08:30,910
-Ms. Collins... -Bri.

79
00:08:30,977 --> 00:08:37,016
Bri. I know you've been feeling
restless the last few months.

80
00:08:37,083 --> 00:08:41,120
Most people take online
classes, or learn a new skill.

81
00:08:41,187 --> 00:08:43,027
Is there anything that
you're working towards?

82
00:08:43,089 --> 00:08:45,391
Not trying to brag,
but I have become

83
00:08:45,458 --> 00:08:48,794
the best at binge-watching
reality dating shows.

84
00:08:50,429 --> 00:08:51,797
Mm.

85
00:08:55,668 --> 00:08:58,504
I'd like to go back to school.

86
00:08:58,571 --> 00:08:59,972
Finish my MBA.

87
00:09:00,973 --> 00:09:03,476
Are you socializing at all?

88
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:05,478
Haven't you heard?

89
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:09,248
I'm the pariah at
Sandpoint Lake.

90
00:09:09,315 --> 00:09:12,118
Bringing down property
values in a single bound.

91
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:15,621
Also I, I have a fish,

92
00:09:15,688 --> 00:09:19,292
so my social life is
basically perfect.

93
00:09:19,358 --> 00:09:21,561
I've had to dispatch the police

94
00:09:21,627 --> 00:09:23,362
repeatedly the
last three months.

95
00:09:23,429 --> 00:09:26,032
I-I know. It's just the
signal on this thing...

96
00:09:26,098 --> 00:09:28,668
Is that something that's
going to continue?

97
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:35,908
-No. -Good.

98
00:09:35,975 --> 00:09:39,145
Any contact with
your ex-husband?

99
00:09:39,211 --> 00:09:40,346
No.

100
00:09:42,682 --> 00:09:45,051
But he does call every day.

101
00:09:45,117 --> 00:09:47,787
He is not permitted to call
anyone who's not on his list.

102
00:09:47,853 --> 00:09:50,756
Well, I'll just let him
know the next time he calls.

103
00:09:54,994 --> 00:09:56,896
Are you sure you can't stay?

104
00:09:56,963 --> 00:09:59,632
I will see you again next month.

105
00:09:59,699 --> 00:10:02,168
I don't wanna hear
from you until then.

106
00:10:04,337 --> 00:10:05,805
"Love Island."

107
00:10:05,871 --> 00:10:09,408
If you're looking for the
best trashy dating show,

108
00:10:09,475 --> 00:10:11,777
check out "Love Island."

109
00:10:17,483 --> 00:10:19,218
Coffee is ready.

110
00:10:59,392 --> 00:11:00,760
Mm.

111
00:11:07,933 --> 00:11:10,336
Hell no, Michael.

112
00:11:13,973 --> 00:11:16,475
House, play classical music.

113
00:11:16,542 --> 00:11:17,953
Classic music playing

114
00:11:17,977 --> 00:11:19,478
in the Master Bathroom.

115
00:11:25,584 --> 00:11:27,553
House, stop.

116
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:29,689
House, turn off the music.

117
00:11:29,755 --> 00:11:31,791
House, shut up!

118
00:13:06,619 --> 00:13:08,154
House, are the doors locked?

119
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:09,731
All doors are locked.

120
00:13:09,755 --> 00:13:12,358
What the hell happened?

121
00:13:12,424 --> 00:13:15,594
I think somebody
was in the house.

122
00:13:15,661 --> 00:13:17,196
Oh, my god.

123
00:13:17,263 --> 00:13:18,297
Yeah.

124
00:13:18,364 --> 00:13:20,132
And the alarm
didn't even go off.

125
00:13:20,199 --> 00:13:23,602
Michael is the only other
person that has access to it.

126
00:13:23,669 --> 00:13:26,438
Honey, he can't break
into your house from jail.

127
00:13:27,773 --> 00:13:30,075
Is that a stun gun?

128
00:13:31,811 --> 00:13:33,879
Got it online.

129
00:13:33,946 --> 00:13:35,915
Look, I know you didn't
wanna call the police.

130
00:13:35,981 --> 00:13:38,450
I'm not on good terms with them.

131
00:13:38,517 --> 00:13:41,620
They're always coming here
to check the stupid monitor.

132
00:13:44,156 --> 00:13:48,227
Well, I called them
for you. Just in case.

133
00:13:51,630 --> 00:13:55,501
Huh. I'm sorry to give
you ladies a scare.

134
00:13:55,568 --> 00:13:57,203
I'm Detective Joe Hall.

135
00:13:57,269 --> 00:13:59,939
I'm with the County
Sheriff's Department.

136
00:14:00,005 --> 00:14:02,508
Hi, I'm Bri. I live here.

137
00:14:02,575 --> 00:14:04,043
This is my friend Sofia.

138
00:14:04,109 --> 00:14:06,545
She's the one that called
about the disturbance.

139
00:14:06,612 --> 00:14:09,114
-You live here, too?
-No. Just visiting.

140
00:14:09,181 --> 00:14:11,183
Is there a man in the house?

141
00:14:12,551 --> 00:14:15,321
So it's only you,
all alone here?

142
00:14:18,357 --> 00:14:19,625
Hey.

143
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:23,896
I know you. Aren't you
Michael Miller's wife?

144
00:14:23,963 --> 00:14:25,130
Ex-wife.

145
00:14:25,197 --> 00:14:26,197
You know, he pissed a lot

146
00:14:26,232 --> 00:14:27,566
of people off with what he did.

147
00:14:27,633 --> 00:14:30,069
A couple guys in our
department lost everything.

148
00:14:30,135 --> 00:14:32,471
Well, good thing I am not him.

149
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:35,608
Right.

150
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:40,913
So, why don't you walk
me through what happened?

151
00:14:56,495 --> 00:14:59,798
Graduation photo. What school?

152
00:14:59,865 --> 00:15:02,468
USC. Cross country scholarship.

153
00:15:02,534 --> 00:15:04,136
Mm. Impressive.

154
00:15:07,039 --> 00:15:10,109
Any security cameras
in the house?

155
00:15:10,175 --> 00:15:13,879
No. My ex refused.

156
00:15:13,946 --> 00:15:15,981
This is our vacation home.

157
00:15:16,048 --> 00:15:17,449
He wanted privacy.

158
00:15:18,450 --> 00:15:20,719
Is anything missing? Stolen?

159
00:15:20,786 --> 00:15:22,388
I don't think so.

160
00:15:29,094 --> 00:15:32,064
Are you sure you
didn't leave that open?

161
00:15:32,131 --> 00:15:33,508
Breeze could have
knocked that over.

162
00:15:33,532 --> 00:15:36,535
You think she's going
to leave a door open?

163
00:15:36,602 --> 00:15:39,772
Like you said, it is
just her, all alone here.

164
00:15:39,838 --> 00:15:41,807
Well, you know, these
houses on the water,

165
00:15:41,874 --> 00:15:44,143
they settle every now and again.

166
00:15:45,444 --> 00:15:48,314
It wasn't, because the
house is on the water...

167
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:49,424
Unless a crime has
been committed,

168
00:15:49,448 --> 00:15:51,450
there isn't much we can do.

169
00:15:51,517 --> 00:15:53,852
I can fill out a report,
and I'm happy to do that,

170
00:15:53,919 --> 00:15:55,754
if that's what you'd like...

171
00:15:58,924 --> 00:16:01,827
But, if anything else happens...

172
00:16:01,894 --> 00:16:03,696
give me a call, personally.

173
00:16:07,499 --> 00:16:10,469
Oh, and keep those doors closed.

174
00:16:11,870 --> 00:16:15,140
What an asshole!

175
00:16:15,207 --> 00:16:19,178
Ugh, cops can be so
useless sometimes.

176
00:16:19,244 --> 00:16:22,915
Look, I'll stay the night,
we'll get some wine,

177
00:16:22,982 --> 00:16:24,717
try and forget about this.

178
00:16:26,685 --> 00:16:28,587
Get the cabernet!

179
00:16:34,493 --> 00:16:35,661
Sofia?

180
00:16:38,364 --> 00:16:40,265
Sofia! Are you okay?

181
00:16:42,034 --> 00:16:45,404
Ohh, look what I found.

182
00:16:45,471 --> 00:16:47,573
That's one of
Michael's favorites.

183
00:16:50,809 --> 00:16:52,378
Do it.

184
00:16:52,444 --> 00:16:55,180
Huh, speaking of
Michael's favorites...

185
00:16:57,216 --> 00:16:59,385
look what I found
under the couch.

186
00:17:00,886 --> 00:17:02,054
They aren't mine.

187
00:17:02,121 --> 00:17:05,324
Ew. Do you think...

188
00:17:05,391 --> 00:17:07,826
That Michael brought other
women over to cheat on me

189
00:17:07,893 --> 00:17:09,528
without me knowing?

190
00:17:09,595 --> 00:17:13,599
Why, yes, I'm beginning
to suspect it. Ugh.

191
00:17:13,665 --> 00:17:16,402
Probably why he never
installed cameras.

192
00:17:17,803 --> 00:17:19,138
That's enough.

193
00:17:19,204 --> 00:17:22,241
We're cleansing the
whole damn place.

194
00:17:25,477 --> 00:17:29,081
- Is that all Michael's stuff?
- Everything flammable.

195
00:17:29,148 --> 00:17:31,050
Ashes to ashes.

196
00:17:31,116 --> 00:17:32,851
Dust to dust.

197
00:17:37,790 --> 00:17:38,957
How did that feel?

198
00:17:39,024 --> 00:17:42,628
Good. Really, really good.

199
00:17:42,694 --> 00:17:45,364
Can I do one? Give
me a little taste.

200
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,735
Damn, this is nice.

201
00:17:49,802 --> 00:17:51,070
Yep. Just toss it in.

202
00:17:51,136 --> 00:17:54,139
I'm just saying, the
man had good taste.

203
00:17:54,206 --> 00:17:56,208
He did pick you.

204
00:17:56,275 --> 00:17:58,510
Ohh, screw you, Michael!

205
00:17:58,577 --> 00:18:00,145
Yeah.

206
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:04,049
Screw you, Michael!

207
00:18:08,153 --> 00:18:09,288
Kill me.

208
00:18:09,354 --> 00:18:11,723
I'm so puffy.

209
00:18:11,790 --> 00:18:13,659
Thank you.

210
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:17,196
I'm never drinking again.

211
00:18:20,566 --> 00:18:22,668
At least not until
later tonight.

212
00:18:24,736 --> 00:18:28,507
-Sofia. -Hey, I'm not judging.

213
00:18:29,441 --> 00:18:31,677
No, Sofia. Come here.

214
00:18:48,093 --> 00:18:51,363
Someone left this picture of
me the first day I was here.

215
00:18:51,430 --> 00:18:53,732
Then my house got broken into.

216
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:55,667
And now all of this.

217
00:18:55,734 --> 00:18:57,669
It gotta have something
to do with Michael.

218
00:18:57,736 --> 00:19:00,205
Michael? How does
that make sense?

219
00:19:00,272 --> 00:19:02,074
Maybe he hired
someone. I don't know.

220
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:04,018
- He has a lot of friends.
- And a lot of enemies.

221
00:19:04,042 --> 00:19:07,212
Could be someone trying to
get back at him through you.

222
00:19:07,279 --> 00:19:09,047
It's comforting.

223
00:19:09,114 --> 00:19:10,883
What am I supposed to do?

224
00:19:10,949 --> 00:19:12,417
Should I call the police again?

225
00:19:12,484 --> 00:19:14,753
I don't know, they weren't
exactly helpful yesterday.

226
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:16,488
So, then what? What?

227
00:19:16,555 --> 00:19:18,624
Do I get murdered and then
call the police, Sofia?

228
00:19:18,690 --> 00:19:21,860
Jesus, Bri. Let's not
jump straight to murder.

229
00:19:23,462 --> 00:19:25,397
Take a deep breath.

230
00:19:28,066 --> 00:19:31,136
Um, I'm, I'm not trying
to say this to scare you,

231
00:19:31,203 --> 00:19:34,039
but all this, the photos,

232
00:19:34,106 --> 00:19:35,574
the open doors...

233
00:19:35,641 --> 00:19:38,177
Whoever's doing this
is toying with you.

234
00:19:38,243 --> 00:19:40,179
This is a game to them.

235
00:19:40,245 --> 00:19:41,413
Well, I don't wanna play.

236
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:42,724
Your only other
option is to leave

237
00:19:42,748 --> 00:19:45,317
and you're kind of stuck here.

238
00:19:45,384 --> 00:19:47,119
So, what do I do?

239
00:19:47,186 --> 00:19:49,087
How do I win?

240
00:19:49,154 --> 00:19:50,522
You write your own rules.

241
00:19:50,589 --> 00:19:51,957
Take control of the situation.

242
00:19:52,024 --> 00:19:53,892
What, take control?

243
00:19:53,959 --> 00:19:55,460
What does that mean, buy a gun?

244
00:19:55,527 --> 00:19:59,731
Ew. No. Hire one.

245
00:19:59,798 --> 00:20:02,000
Have you considered
personal security?

246
00:20:03,802 --> 00:20:06,371
If the cops can't help,

247
00:20:06,438 --> 00:20:08,307
what's a rent-a-cop gonna do?

248
00:20:08,373 --> 00:20:10,509
He's there to keep you safe.

249
00:20:10,576 --> 00:20:12,444
Give him a chance.

250
00:20:12,511 --> 00:20:13,955
He worked for a client
a few months back.

251
00:20:13,979 --> 00:20:16,415
The man is good at what he does.

252
00:20:16,481 --> 00:20:19,251
Think about it. You
gotta protect yourself.

253
00:20:35,133 --> 00:20:36,711
This is a collect call

254
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:38,146
from Bancroft
Correctional Facility.

255
00:20:38,170 --> 00:20:40,639
Say yes or press one
to accept charges.

256
00:20:42,307 --> 00:20:43,875
Yes.

257
00:20:46,945 --> 00:20:48,814
-Michael?
-I'm so glad you answered.

258
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:51,917
-How are you?
-Why are you keep calling me?

259
00:20:51,984 --> 00:20:54,853
To make sure you're all right.
I've been worried about you.

260
00:20:56,488 --> 00:20:58,290
Have you been watching me?

261
00:20:58,357 --> 00:21:00,559
Why would I need to do that?

262
00:21:00,626 --> 00:21:03,729
I know exactly where you
are. And for how long.

263
00:21:03,795 --> 00:21:06,331
I bet you're in the bed room
at the lake house right now.

264
00:21:07,699 --> 00:21:11,003
How many bottles of my
wine have you gone through?

265
00:21:11,069 --> 00:21:14,773
I wanted you to know,
I'm being released.

266
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:19,077
What? You've only been in
jail three months. How?

267
00:21:19,144 --> 00:21:21,513
Good behavior.

268
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:23,081
You remember Judge Gettman.

269
00:21:23,148 --> 00:21:26,418
I spoke with him and,
uh, we both decided

270
00:21:26,485 --> 00:21:28,487
I've paid my debt to society.

271
00:21:31,023 --> 00:21:32,691
I'd love to see you.

272
00:21:47,439 --> 00:21:49,007
Hey.

273
00:21:50,475 --> 00:21:51,510
Bri Collins?

274
00:21:51,576 --> 00:21:53,712
You must be Xavier.

275
00:21:54,713 --> 00:21:56,181
Thank you for the house call.

276
00:21:56,248 --> 00:21:57,783
I'm here to accommodate.

277
00:21:57,849 --> 00:21:59,584
Wanna run me through
what's going on?

278
00:22:01,286 --> 00:22:02,854
Can we talk in the back?

279
00:22:05,257 --> 00:22:06,658
You mind?

280
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:10,429
Help yourself.

281
00:22:10,495 --> 00:22:12,531
So you need some, uh,
personal security?

282
00:22:14,499 --> 00:22:17,302
Uh, yeah. Somebody
has been watching me.

283
00:22:17,369 --> 00:22:19,905
And now they're letting me
know that they're watching me.

284
00:22:19,971 --> 00:22:22,407
You have any idea
who's doing that?

285
00:22:22,474 --> 00:22:24,743
My ex, Michael Miller.

286
00:22:26,044 --> 00:22:27,713
Michael Miller.

287
00:22:29,915 --> 00:22:31,259
Michael Miller
that went to prison

288
00:22:31,283 --> 00:22:33,452
for the pump and dump scheme.

289
00:22:39,524 --> 00:22:41,460
Have you contacted the police?

290
00:22:42,260 --> 00:22:44,096
Yep.

291
00:22:44,162 --> 00:22:47,733
They won't help me.
At least not yet.

292
00:22:50,235 --> 00:22:51,235
Sounds about right.

293
00:22:51,269 --> 00:22:52,270
I have nine months left

294
00:22:52,337 --> 00:22:53,739
until my sentence is up.

295
00:22:53,805 --> 00:22:56,508
I just need some security
to keep an eye on me,

296
00:22:56,575 --> 00:22:58,143
make sure I'm safe.

297
00:22:59,678 --> 00:23:01,680
So, can you help me?

298
00:23:04,950 --> 00:23:07,018
Nah, I'm good.

299
00:23:07,085 --> 00:23:08,487
You're good?

300
00:23:08,553 --> 00:23:12,157
Yeah. I'm good.

301
00:23:12,224 --> 00:23:14,693
-Are you serious?
-Thanks for calling.

302
00:23:15,994 --> 00:23:17,496
Good luck.

303
00:23:17,562 --> 00:23:19,464
And thanks for the apple.

304
00:23:19,531 --> 00:23:21,466
-Are you serious? -Yeah.

305
00:23:21,533 --> 00:23:24,069
Look, I'm not a prison guard.

306
00:23:24,136 --> 00:23:26,138
Sittin' around here
guardin' you for nine months

307
00:23:26,204 --> 00:23:28,206
is not exactly my dream job.

308
00:23:29,674 --> 00:23:31,209
I understand.

309
00:23:31,276 --> 00:23:34,913
It's honestly probably too
dangerous for you, anyway.

310
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:37,649
I need someone who knows
how to handle themselves.

311
00:23:38,984 --> 00:23:41,153
Plus, you're a little
bit on the skinny side.

312
00:23:43,655 --> 00:23:46,525
-Are you actually doing this?
-Do what?

313
00:23:48,093 --> 00:23:50,562
Tryin' to appeal to...

314
00:23:50,629 --> 00:23:53,365
fragile point in my masculinity

315
00:23:53,432 --> 00:23:55,400
to win me over.

316
00:23:55,467 --> 00:23:58,136
Mm. Is it working?

317
00:23:59,304 --> 00:24:00,705
No.

318
00:24:01,907 --> 00:24:05,777
Okay, fine. I will
pay you double.

319
00:24:05,844 --> 00:24:07,712
Whatever you're
making on another job,

320
00:24:07,779 --> 00:24:10,248
I-I will beat that.

321
00:24:14,286 --> 00:24:16,655
You really think your
ex-husband will go this far?

322
00:24:16,721 --> 00:24:18,423
He's the smartest man I know.

323
00:24:18,490 --> 00:24:21,159
He's also the most vindictive.

324
00:24:21,226 --> 00:24:25,564
Through the years, he had
me sign things for taxes

325
00:24:25,630 --> 00:24:29,167
and retirement,
or so he told me.

326
00:24:29,234 --> 00:24:32,070
I trusted and loved my husband.

327
00:24:32,137 --> 00:24:34,606
In return, he built a
mountain of evidence

328
00:24:34,673 --> 00:24:35,974
linking me to his crimes.

329
00:24:36,041 --> 00:24:39,077
When he was arrested
and I finally left him,

330
00:24:39,144 --> 00:24:41,346
he blackmailed me.

331
00:24:41,413 --> 00:24:43,615
Trying to make me stay.

332
00:24:44,616 --> 00:24:46,918
I didn't.

333
00:24:46,985 --> 00:24:50,555
So then, he took me down with
him as an aider and abider.

334
00:24:50,622 --> 00:24:52,524
Was he ever violent you?

335
00:24:56,828 --> 00:25:01,366
Still, you shouldn't, uh,
shouldn't close the door

336
00:25:01,433 --> 00:25:03,068
on any other possibilities.

337
00:25:03,134 --> 00:25:07,138
Who else will be
stalking me? And why?

338
00:25:07,205 --> 00:25:10,675
I don't know. It could
be anybody at this point.

339
00:25:10,742 --> 00:25:14,179
But I do know that
there's another young lady

340
00:25:14,246 --> 00:25:17,816
around your age that
went missing around here.

341
00:25:17,883 --> 00:25:21,286
I remember reading about
this. They never found her?

342
00:25:21,353 --> 00:25:22,854
Yeah.

343
00:25:24,990 --> 00:25:27,325
So you think that might
have something to do with

344
00:25:27,392 --> 00:25:28,593
what's happening to me?

345
00:25:28,660 --> 00:25:31,329
I don't know.

346
00:25:31,396 --> 00:25:33,532
I sure hope not.

347
00:25:33,598 --> 00:25:35,267
No.

348
00:25:35,333 --> 00:25:36,735
No.

349
00:25:36,801 --> 00:25:38,837
It has to be Michael.

350
00:25:38,904 --> 00:25:40,639
I've been saying
this from the start

351
00:25:40,705 --> 00:25:43,308
and nobody is listening to me.

352
00:25:43,375 --> 00:25:47,746
Michael has put me
through hell for years.

353
00:25:47,812 --> 00:25:49,681
I hear you.

354
00:25:51,650 --> 00:25:53,852
When Cheyenne went missing,

355
00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:57,289
police never found any
evidence of a crime.

356
00:25:57,355 --> 00:26:00,158
They said she was an adult
and that she could just leave

357
00:26:00,225 --> 00:26:01,826
whenever she wanted
to without notice.

358
00:26:01,893 --> 00:26:04,963
My point is, I'm listening.

359
00:26:05,030 --> 00:26:07,232
I hear you and I'll believe you.

360
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:11,036
And I'll do whatever I
can to keep you safe.

361
00:27:23,575 --> 00:27:25,043
Bri!

362
00:27:27,312 --> 00:27:28,446
Okay.

363
00:27:33,251 --> 00:27:35,253
Hey! Hey!

364
00:27:42,661 --> 00:27:44,696
I got you.

365
00:27:52,637 --> 00:27:54,172
Excuse me a minute.

366
00:27:57,542 --> 00:28:00,145
I'm gonna go easy on
you today, Ms. Collins.

367
00:28:00,211 --> 00:28:03,314
But if it happens again, we
will add to your sentence.

368
00:28:03,381 --> 00:28:07,318
We'll send you a bill
for the ankle monitor.

369
00:28:07,385 --> 00:28:09,054
Keep in touch.

370
00:28:10,455 --> 00:28:12,123
You doing okay?

371
00:28:12,190 --> 00:28:15,193
A little shaken
up, but I'm fine.

372
00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:17,028
Any idea what happened
with the boat water?

373
00:28:17,095 --> 00:28:20,498
Xavier's looking into
it, but no, not yet.

374
00:28:20,565 --> 00:28:22,500
Sofia, I don't know
what would have happened

375
00:28:22,567 --> 00:28:24,869
if he weren't here.

376
00:28:24,936 --> 00:28:27,005
Nice to have a bodyguard around.

377
00:28:29,674 --> 00:28:32,777
Especially one as fit as he is.

378
00:28:33,645 --> 00:28:35,580
That's not even on my mind.

379
00:28:35,647 --> 00:28:39,217
And he hasn't even looked at
me twice since he's been here.

380
00:28:39,284 --> 00:28:43,855
Maybe you'd feel better if
you cleaned up a little bit.

381
00:28:43,922 --> 00:28:47,092
Washed the house
arrest off of you.

382
00:28:47,158 --> 00:28:50,729
I have enough to worry
about right now, trust me.

383
00:28:50,795 --> 00:28:53,398
I'm just saying, you are single.

384
00:28:53,465 --> 00:28:55,743
If I were you, I'd be on a
dating app getting house calls

385
00:28:55,767 --> 00:28:57,202
every night.

386
00:28:57,268 --> 00:29:00,371
I don't think death threats
really are a turn on.

387
00:29:00,438 --> 00:29:04,075
Mm, see, that's where you
and I will have to disagree.

388
00:29:07,879 --> 00:29:09,881
Try it.

389
00:29:09,948 --> 00:29:12,050
Ten bucks says he notices.

390
00:29:18,723 --> 00:29:21,292
-Hey. -Hey.

391
00:29:22,427 --> 00:29:23,947
I wanted to see if
there was something

392
00:29:23,995 --> 00:29:26,998
that pointed back to
what started the fire.

393
00:29:27,065 --> 00:29:30,869
Mm, you know how to
disassemble boat motors?

394
00:29:31,970 --> 00:29:35,406
Yeah. Looks like
impeller failure.

395
00:29:35,473 --> 00:29:39,477
That'd make sense with a T-shirt
blocking the water intake.

396
00:29:39,544 --> 00:29:41,813
You think someone
clogged it on purpose?

397
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:44,783
Wasn't an accident.

398
00:29:44,849 --> 00:29:47,719
T-shirt hasn't been
in the water long.

399
00:29:47,786 --> 00:29:49,387
Did you find anything else?

400
00:29:52,557 --> 00:29:54,025
No.

401
00:30:00,398 --> 00:30:02,033
This number mean
anything to you?

402
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:05,103
I don't think so.

403
00:30:05,170 --> 00:30:06,504
Why?

404
00:30:08,106 --> 00:30:10,008
Just checking.

405
00:30:16,848 --> 00:30:18,483
You look nice.

406
00:30:34,232 --> 00:30:36,167
Is everything okay?

407
00:30:36,234 --> 00:30:39,204
It's fine. Um, are you hungry?

408
00:30:40,738 --> 00:30:42,540
So you made me dinner?

409
00:30:42,607 --> 00:30:44,175
You can take it off my tab.

410
00:30:45,743 --> 00:30:47,011
Thanks.

411
00:30:48,346 --> 00:30:51,516
Hey, uh, do you wanna join me?

412
00:30:53,818 --> 00:30:56,754
I do fine by myself.

413
00:30:56,821 --> 00:30:59,290
That's very brooding of you.

414
00:30:59,357 --> 00:31:01,860
Unfortunately, I'm the boss

415
00:31:01,926 --> 00:31:04,229
and I would like some company.

416
00:31:06,431 --> 00:31:10,168
Okay. I'll get dressed. Boss.

417
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:38,096
We've been spending a
lot of time together.

418
00:31:39,497 --> 00:31:43,134
It's really weird that I
don't know anything about you.

419
00:31:43,201 --> 00:31:45,303
Like where are you from?

420
00:31:46,271 --> 00:31:49,841
-All over. -How about this?

421
00:31:49,908 --> 00:31:52,710
If I guess something
right about you,

422
00:31:52,777 --> 00:31:54,078
you take a step closer.

423
00:31:54,145 --> 00:31:56,314
And if you guess
something right about me,

424
00:31:56,381 --> 00:31:58,816
I'll take one step towards you.

425
00:31:58,883 --> 00:32:01,786
If I win, you will
relax and eat.

426
00:32:01,853 --> 00:32:05,890
If I lose, you can continue
standing there stoically.

427
00:32:05,957 --> 00:32:07,592
Cool?

428
00:32:10,128 --> 00:32:11,996
You're from a small town.

429
00:32:14,132 --> 00:32:16,467
You're from Arizona.

430
00:32:16,534 --> 00:32:20,238
Judging by your accent, Phoenix.

431
00:32:20,305 --> 00:32:21,706
Wow.

432
00:32:21,773 --> 00:32:25,176
I didn't know people in
Phoenix had an accent.

433
00:32:26,177 --> 00:32:28,947
I can read people, easily.

434
00:32:29,013 --> 00:32:30,848
Then this should be fun.

435
00:32:30,915 --> 00:32:34,485
You moved to Sandpoint because
you were running from something.

436
00:32:35,753 --> 00:32:40,091
You're probably in the
middle class family.

437
00:32:40,158 --> 00:32:43,227
No, lower-middle class.

438
00:32:45,363 --> 00:32:47,365
Ouch.

439
00:32:47,432 --> 00:32:52,036
You're an only child, going
by your social skills.

440
00:32:53,204 --> 00:32:55,173
You have a sister.

441
00:32:55,239 --> 00:32:57,442
You're definitely the older one.

442
00:33:00,178 --> 00:33:02,246
You played football
in high-school.

443
00:33:03,548 --> 00:33:05,249
You're athletic.

444
00:33:06,684 --> 00:33:08,119
Runner.

445
00:33:12,156 --> 00:33:15,760
Okay. I win.

446
00:33:15,827 --> 00:33:17,295
Have your meal.

447
00:33:21,866 --> 00:33:25,436
You can really tell all of
that just by looking at me?

448
00:33:25,503 --> 00:33:26,637
Nah.

449
00:33:28,139 --> 00:33:31,142
-I Googled you.
-Come on, that's not fair.

450
00:33:31,209 --> 00:33:33,011
I'm not here to be fair.

451
00:33:33,077 --> 00:33:34,746
I'm here to protect you.

452
00:33:34,812 --> 00:33:37,281
Which I am very grateful for.

453
00:33:37,348 --> 00:33:39,050
I'm not the most
intimidating person.

454
00:33:39,117 --> 00:33:41,219
Look, let me show you something.

455
00:33:43,888 --> 00:33:46,557
Ju-Jitsu, it's like human chess.

456
00:33:47,959 --> 00:33:49,794
You know Ju-Jitsu, too?

457
00:33:49,861 --> 00:33:51,329
Yeah.

458
00:33:52,697 --> 00:33:55,066
So, what you do is you
take your opponent's weight

459
00:33:55,133 --> 00:33:57,068
and you use it against him.

460
00:33:57,135 --> 00:33:58,736
Put your glass down.

461
00:34:05,476 --> 00:34:08,646
If I come at you with a
punch, block it. Right.

462
00:34:08,713 --> 00:34:12,583
And then I want you to shift
your weight right there,

463
00:34:12,650 --> 00:34:15,787
next to my body. You feel that?

464
00:34:15,853 --> 00:34:17,021
All right.

465
00:34:17,088 --> 00:34:20,324
Take me back like
this. You see that?

466
00:34:21,926 --> 00:34:24,095
I'm gonna tell you to
take my weight over

467
00:34:24,162 --> 00:34:25,663
and let the momentum
take me over.

468
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:27,298
Sorry.

469
00:34:27,365 --> 00:34:30,234
I should have warned
you I'm a bad ass.

470
00:34:31,936 --> 00:34:33,237
Yeah.

471
00:34:33,304 --> 00:34:34,772
I should have read it.

472
00:34:34,839 --> 00:34:37,608
So, it's on me, really.

473
00:34:37,675 --> 00:34:41,679
You know, if you don't tell
me something about yourself,

474
00:34:41,746 --> 00:34:43,781
I'm gonna have to make it up.

475
00:34:45,583 --> 00:34:49,720
You're... tough on the outside,

476
00:34:49,787 --> 00:34:55,059
but... I think you're a
big softie on the inside.

477
00:34:55,126 --> 00:34:56,761
Mm, the kind of guy who

478
00:34:56,828 --> 00:35:00,431
carries missing person's
posters in his bag.

479
00:35:00,498 --> 00:35:02,300
Hey, you know, I should
get back to the...

480
00:35:02,366 --> 00:35:04,135
Mm. Mmh-mnh.

481
00:35:04,202 --> 00:35:05,269
You're not going anywhere

482
00:35:05,336 --> 00:35:07,338
until you tell me something.

483
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:10,608
Anything.

484
00:35:13,244 --> 00:35:17,448
When I say that I'm from
everywhere, I mean it.

485
00:35:17,515 --> 00:35:20,318
I come from a military family.

486
00:35:20,384 --> 00:35:22,053
We moved around a lot.

487
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:23,788
But no matter where we went,

488
00:35:23,855 --> 00:35:27,191
my father would
find an old theater

489
00:35:27,258 --> 00:35:28,826
playing a cowboy movie.

490
00:35:30,328 --> 00:35:32,997
And he'd drag us off to see it.

491
00:35:33,064 --> 00:35:34,765
See, was that so hard?

492
00:35:36,501 --> 00:35:41,339
So... why do you carry
those posters around?

493
00:35:54,285 --> 00:35:56,387
Cheyenne is my sister.

494
00:35:56,454 --> 00:35:59,157
And I carry the posters around

495
00:35:59,223 --> 00:36:01,225
because somebody
keeps taking 'em down.

496
00:36:01,292 --> 00:36:03,761
And I'm not gonna let
this town forget her.

497
00:36:05,163 --> 00:36:07,865
She over moved here
a few years ago.

498
00:36:09,433 --> 00:36:13,204
And just stopped
answering my calls.

499
00:36:13,271 --> 00:36:17,175
So... I put my life on the hold,

500
00:36:17,241 --> 00:36:20,378
and I moved here
to try to find her.

501
00:36:21,779 --> 00:36:25,783
But when the police just
wouldn't take me serious,

502
00:36:25,850 --> 00:36:28,219
wouldn't respond...

503
00:36:28,286 --> 00:36:31,122
I bought that old RV out there

504
00:36:31,189 --> 00:36:32,857
and I took it upon myself.

505
00:36:35,393 --> 00:36:37,428
And that was two years ago.

506
00:36:39,197 --> 00:36:42,633
- She's lucky to have you.
- Listen, I gotta go, all right?

507
00:36:44,735 --> 00:36:46,470
Goodnight.

508
00:36:52,677 --> 00:36:54,045
What are
you doing here?

509
00:36:54,111 --> 00:36:56,981
I just wanted to
come by and see Brianna.

510
00:36:57,048 --> 00:36:58,525
I can't let
you do that. Let's go.

511
00:36:58,549 --> 00:36:59,693
Hey, come on, come on.

512
00:36:59,717 --> 00:37:01,385
Get your, get your hands off me.

513
00:37:01,452 --> 00:37:03,054
Bro, this is my house.

514
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:05,289
Michael.

515
00:37:05,356 --> 00:37:07,825
Brianna! Tell him to let me go.

516
00:37:07,892 --> 00:37:09,627
What are you doing here?

517
00:37:09,694 --> 00:37:11,495
I came to see how you're doing.

518
00:37:11,562 --> 00:37:13,864
Pick up a few things.
I'll only be a minute.

519
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:18,269
Let him up.

520
00:37:24,008 --> 00:37:25,576
Wow.

521
00:37:25,643 --> 00:37:26,777
This place looks great.

522
00:37:26,844 --> 00:37:28,713
You've been taking
good care of it.

523
00:37:30,314 --> 00:37:32,350
Hey, House, put on some coffee.

524
00:37:32,416 --> 00:37:34,151
Right away, Michael.

525
00:37:34,218 --> 00:37:36,420
I missed this place.

526
00:37:38,589 --> 00:37:40,524
I missed that view.

527
00:37:44,629 --> 00:37:47,298
I missed that view more.

528
00:37:47,365 --> 00:37:48,933
I forgive you, by the way.

529
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,502
- For testifying against me.
- Michael.

530
00:37:51,569 --> 00:37:53,938
You're lucky
they let you stay here.

531
00:37:54,005 --> 00:37:55,873
You got off easy,
trust me. Prison is...

532
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:58,042
Michael!

533
00:37:58,109 --> 00:38:00,611
What are you doing here?

534
00:38:00,678 --> 00:38:03,681
You know I can get
in trouble for this.

535
00:38:03,748 --> 00:38:06,183
I'm sorry. I
just wanted to see you.

536
00:38:06,250 --> 00:38:09,320
You have no idea how lonely
it was in that place.

537
00:38:11,389 --> 00:38:14,325
Well, here I am. Because of you.

538
00:38:15,993 --> 00:38:19,630
And you can stop everything
that you've been doing now.

539
00:38:22,266 --> 00:38:25,002
-Stop what? -All of it!

540
00:38:25,069 --> 00:38:28,773
The theatrics, the-the
photographs, everything.

541
00:38:28,839 --> 00:38:30,675
-You've made your point.
-Photographs?

542
00:38:30,741 --> 00:38:32,381
What are you, what
are you talking about?

543
00:38:32,443 --> 00:38:33,787
You have been taking
pictures of me.

544
00:38:33,811 --> 00:38:36,714
And leaving them outside.

545
00:38:36,781 --> 00:38:39,717
- Has someone been bothering you?
- Michael, please.

546
00:38:39,784 --> 00:38:41,986
You think I would do
something like that?

547
00:38:45,690 --> 00:38:47,858
I'm trying to move
forward with my life.

548
00:38:50,328 --> 00:38:53,664
I'm sorry, I just...

549
00:38:53,731 --> 00:38:57,001
I just don't know
who else could be doing this.

550
00:39:06,210 --> 00:39:08,446
How many of these
have you gone through?

551
00:39:09,447 --> 00:39:10,848
Stop it.

552
00:39:12,516 --> 00:39:13,694
I was
hoping you'd slow down

553
00:39:13,718 --> 00:39:15,152
on the drinking a little, but...

554
00:39:15,219 --> 00:39:17,621
It's none of your business.

555
00:39:20,658 --> 00:39:22,827
It's my business
when it's my wine.

556
00:39:22,893 --> 00:39:24,562
And my home.

557
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:31,168
Michael, please.

558
00:39:31,235 --> 00:39:34,505
Could you just tell
the truth? For once.

559
00:39:34,572 --> 00:39:36,974
Brianna, I've been
in prison for months.

560
00:39:37,041 --> 00:39:39,410
I have no idea what's
going on. Okay?

561
00:39:39,477 --> 00:39:42,179
But if you're in some kind of
trouble, or you're scared...

562
00:39:43,614 --> 00:39:45,583
I can always help you.

563
00:39:47,885 --> 00:39:49,363
And I want you to
know that I'm sorry

564
00:39:49,387 --> 00:39:51,122
about how everything went down.

565
00:39:55,359 --> 00:39:56,694
Things are different now.

566
00:39:56,761 --> 00:39:58,996
And I can prove that
to you if you let me.

567
00:40:05,536 --> 00:40:07,805
Xavier, can you
show him out please?

568
00:40:39,837 --> 00:40:42,039
House, lower the temperature.

569
00:40:45,576 --> 00:40:49,480
House, turn off the heater.

570
00:40:53,617 --> 00:40:55,686
House, are you there?

571
00:41:14,104 --> 00:41:15,706
Xavier?

572
00:41:20,511 --> 00:41:22,079
Xavier!

573
00:42:52,937 --> 00:42:55,406
Bri, wake up. Hey!

574
00:42:55,472 --> 00:42:57,541
Hey, hey, hey. Bri, wake up!

575
00:42:57,608 --> 00:42:59,610
Hey, hey, hey.

576
00:43:08,218 --> 00:43:11,121
I came as soon as I
seen all the lights flashing.

577
00:43:12,790 --> 00:43:14,692
The keypad wouldn't let me in.

578
00:43:15,993 --> 00:43:18,762
I was gonna break
the window, but...

579
00:43:18,829 --> 00:43:22,066
then the door just unlocked.

580
00:43:25,269 --> 00:43:27,471
Michael.

581
00:43:27,538 --> 00:43:29,440
Michael?

582
00:43:29,506 --> 00:43:31,208
He's the only other person

583
00:43:31,275 --> 00:43:33,744
that could have
control over the house.

584
00:43:35,012 --> 00:43:37,581
Why would he do that,
come in and hit you

585
00:43:37,648 --> 00:43:39,516
when he's on parole?

586
00:43:39,583 --> 00:43:42,186
To remind me I can't escape him.

587
00:43:55,065 --> 00:43:56,400
Bri.

588
00:43:58,335 --> 00:43:59,970
Check this out.

589
00:44:03,607 --> 00:44:05,175
Is that a camera?

590
00:44:05,242 --> 00:44:07,111
Yeah.

591
00:44:07,177 --> 00:44:09,380
Hidden in the picture frame.

592
00:44:09,446 --> 00:44:11,749
I thought there were no
cameras in the house.

593
00:44:14,752 --> 00:44:16,253
I didn't think there were.

594
00:44:18,322 --> 00:44:21,058
Son of a bitch has been
watching me this entire time?

595
00:44:27,131 --> 00:44:29,733
Are there cameras everywhere?

596
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:33,003
-Can he see me everywhere?
-Uh, calm down.

597
00:44:33,070 --> 00:44:35,072
I'll sweep the house.

598
00:44:36,573 --> 00:44:37,941
I'll see if there're more, okay?

599
00:44:38,008 --> 00:44:40,844
Xavier, I'm a sitting duck here.

600
00:44:40,911 --> 00:44:42,179
We have to do something.

601
00:44:42,246 --> 00:44:44,748
I think I know
someone who can help.

602
00:44:45,683 --> 00:44:47,484
I promise we'll figure this out.

603
00:44:47,551 --> 00:44:51,455
Could you just stay
the night in the house?

604
00:44:51,522 --> 00:44:52,956
Just for now.

605
00:44:54,158 --> 00:44:56,293
I have a guestroom
that you can use.

606
00:44:57,561 --> 00:44:59,129
It's just, ah...

607
00:45:00,831 --> 00:45:03,233
I don't want to be alone.

608
00:45:03,300 --> 00:45:04,902
Of course.

609
00:45:42,673 --> 00:45:43,907
I don't know.

610
00:45:43,974 --> 00:45:46,009
All right. That's all of them.

611
00:45:49,346 --> 00:45:50,814
Wow.

612
00:45:52,883 --> 00:45:55,686
So, how do you know each other?

613
00:45:55,753 --> 00:45:57,521
Dex and I used to work together.

614
00:45:58,956 --> 00:46:00,791
Yeah, okay.

615
00:46:00,858 --> 00:46:04,294
So here's the deal, someone
gained access to your system

616
00:46:04,361 --> 00:46:06,363
via the app that
controls the house.

617
00:46:06,430 --> 00:46:08,675
I tried to track the IP address,
but nothing's coming up.

618
00:46:08,699 --> 00:46:09,809
Probably spoofed through a VPN.

619
00:46:09,833 --> 00:46:11,268
What do you mean?

620
00:46:11,335 --> 00:46:13,470
It means that your attacker
covered their tracks.

621
00:46:13,537 --> 00:46:17,007
Exactly. I locked out any other
users, so only you have control.

622
00:46:17,074 --> 00:46:19,376
Now, about the cameras.

623
00:46:19,443 --> 00:46:22,379
I can't find a way to access
the video feeds online.

624
00:46:22,446 --> 00:46:24,214
Meaning, it's being
stored locally.

625
00:46:24,281 --> 00:46:26,750
- So we can watch the footage?
- Oh, no. That's the thing.

626
00:46:26,817 --> 00:46:28,352
It's not being
stored locally here.

627
00:46:28,418 --> 00:46:30,821
I was able to track it to a
location closer to the city.

628
00:46:30,888 --> 00:46:32,723
About fifty miles away.

629
00:46:32,790 --> 00:46:34,925
Michael's house.

630
00:46:34,992 --> 00:46:38,462
It was our main residence.
Has to be there.

631
00:46:38,529 --> 00:46:41,231
If you want to see the footage,
that's where you'll find it.

632
00:46:42,833 --> 00:46:44,601
That's not really an option.

633
00:46:44,668 --> 00:46:47,137
Oh, my God. Cool.

634
00:46:47,204 --> 00:46:49,139
Maybe I could go in.

635
00:46:49,206 --> 00:46:51,241
Get in and out before
anybody sees me.

636
00:46:52,176 --> 00:46:53,877
I'm not staying here alone.

637
00:46:53,944 --> 00:46:55,846
And, you don't
know the property.

638
00:46:55,913 --> 00:46:57,648
-I used to live there. -Hm.

639
00:46:57,714 --> 00:47:01,919
I could help if I could just
get the hell out of this house.

640
00:47:03,086 --> 00:47:04,755
Oh, I can get you outta here.

641
00:47:04,822 --> 00:47:06,390
-Really? -Yeah.

642
00:47:06,456 --> 00:47:08,258
That ankle monitor
uses a SIM card

643
00:47:08,325 --> 00:47:10,127
with GPS to determine
your position,

644
00:47:10,194 --> 00:47:12,138
and a cell data network to
send the coordinates back.

645
00:47:12,162 --> 00:47:13,973
So all you really need to
do is build a Faraday cage

646
00:47:13,997 --> 00:47:15,575
to block the signal,
fake a phone network

647
00:47:15,599 --> 00:47:18,502
to bypass any tamper
control, remove the SIM card

648
00:47:18,569 --> 00:47:20,470
and access it with
your phone, boom.

649
00:47:21,805 --> 00:47:24,041
I have no idea
what you just said.

650
00:47:24,107 --> 00:47:26,076
Basically, your probation
officer will think

651
00:47:26,143 --> 00:47:28,545
that your phone is
your ankle monitor.

652
00:47:28,612 --> 00:47:30,547
It can buy you a
little bit of time.

653
00:47:31,715 --> 00:47:33,750
I'm in.

654
00:47:33,817 --> 00:47:37,421
First, we'll have to get to
Michael's safe room upstairs.

655
00:47:37,487 --> 00:47:39,289
It's where the
security system is.

656
00:47:39,356 --> 00:47:41,291
That's where we'll
find the hard drive.

657
00:47:41,358 --> 00:47:43,393
Safe room. This guy
would have a safe room.

658
00:47:43,460 --> 00:47:45,038
You know, if you want
to break into a house

659
00:47:45,062 --> 00:47:46,506
anything like this one,
there's going to be some

660
00:47:46,530 --> 00:47:47,731
serious tech involved.

661
00:47:47,798 --> 00:47:51,869
And we're talkin' cameras,
alarms, motion lights.

662
00:47:51,935 --> 00:47:54,605
We'll just wait until
he goes upstairs.

663
00:47:54,671 --> 00:47:56,340
If we can cut the power out,

664
00:47:56,406 --> 00:47:58,242
we can get in without
him seeing us.

665
00:47:58,308 --> 00:48:00,911
I can try and access
the power grid remotely.

666
00:48:00,978 --> 00:48:03,113
-Turn it off there. -Great.

667
00:48:05,382 --> 00:48:08,285
But, he has a backup
generator in the backyard.

668
00:48:08,352 --> 00:48:10,988
It automatically turns on
when the power goes out.

669
00:48:12,322 --> 00:48:14,391
We'll have to disarm
it, so we can get inside

670
00:48:14,458 --> 00:48:16,126
and get out before
he figures it out.

671
00:48:16,193 --> 00:48:18,629
So, if we take the hard
drive, will that automatically

672
00:48:18,695 --> 00:48:20,931
wipe the footage
of us bein' inside?

673
00:48:22,199 --> 00:48:24,434
Th-theoretically.

674
00:48:24,501 --> 00:48:26,803
Say we find out
Michael is behind this.

675
00:48:26,870 --> 00:48:30,140
We can't exactly just take the
stolen footage to the police.

676
00:48:37,147 --> 00:48:39,783
All the lies he's told...

677
00:48:39,850 --> 00:48:42,653
all the times he's made
me question myself over

678
00:48:42,719 --> 00:48:44,221
and over again...

679
00:48:45,756 --> 00:48:47,090
I just need to know.

680
00:48:48,558 --> 00:48:51,328
Okay. I'll get to work on
breaking into the power grid.

681
00:48:51,395 --> 00:48:53,463
It should only take
me a day of two.

682
00:48:53,530 --> 00:48:57,401
So, how do we stop the
signal to her ankle monitor?

683
00:49:00,804 --> 00:49:02,506
I have a plan.

684
00:49:04,942 --> 00:49:06,643
It loses signal down here.

685
00:49:06,710 --> 00:49:08,278
But be careful.

686
00:49:08,345 --> 00:49:10,614
If it gets damaged
or it cuts off,

687
00:49:10,681 --> 00:49:12,916
it starts recording
and cops will show up.

688
00:49:12,983 --> 00:49:14,418
Good to know.

689
00:49:14,484 --> 00:49:17,621
Well, you know what? You can
use my phone for network.

690
00:49:17,688 --> 00:49:19,222
Bri's gonna need hers.

691
00:49:19,289 --> 00:49:20,857
How chivalrous.

692
00:49:20,924 --> 00:49:23,927
Don't forget to put the SIM
card back when you're done.

693
00:49:23,994 --> 00:49:25,429
Got it.

694
00:49:27,097 --> 00:49:29,032
Probably get a call in
a few minutes anyway.

695
00:49:37,641 --> 00:49:39,443
Hey, Nancy.

696
00:49:39,509 --> 00:49:42,045
Uh, yeah, yeah. No, no, no.

697
00:49:42,112 --> 00:49:44,948
I forgot. I forgot.
I'm sorry.

698
00:49:45,015 --> 00:49:47,484
Yes, I'm in the basement.

699
00:49:47,551 --> 00:49:49,786
No. I'll head, I'll
head upstairs right now.

700
00:49:52,556 --> 00:49:54,091
Do you see me?

701
00:49:55,158 --> 00:49:57,160
You don't?

702
00:49:57,227 --> 00:49:59,162
No, no, no. You don't
have to send anybody over.

703
00:49:59,229 --> 00:50:00,998
It's okay.

704
00:50:01,064 --> 00:50:02,699
I... Oh, good.

705
00:50:02,766 --> 00:50:04,267
Good, you see me. Yes.

706
00:50:04,334 --> 00:50:06,570
I'm sorry. Goodnight.

707
00:50:08,271 --> 00:50:11,408
Oh, my God. I thought
they'd have a heart attack.

708
00:50:11,475 --> 00:50:12,475
It worked!

709
00:50:13,977 --> 00:50:16,313
You know this is insane, right?

710
00:50:16,380 --> 00:50:19,082
-Yeah. -Well, you're ready?

711
00:50:19,149 --> 00:50:21,618
As ready
as I'm gonna be.

712
00:50:21,685 --> 00:50:23,286
I'm gonna be driving
though, okay?

713
00:50:23,353 --> 00:50:27,691
-No. I need to...
-Your RV is not inconspicuous.

714
00:50:27,758 --> 00:50:29,393
Whatever you say.

715
00:50:37,034 --> 00:50:42,139
Xavier and I, um, we served
together in the marines.

716
00:50:42,205 --> 00:50:44,241
He's a really good man.

717
00:50:59,089 --> 00:51:00,891
Come on.

718
00:51:00,957 --> 00:51:04,227
Come on, Michael. Go
upstairs already. Jesus!

719
00:51:05,962 --> 00:51:08,498
Hey, we can pull this off.

720
00:51:08,565 --> 00:51:12,335
The most illegal thing I've
ever done was skip school.

721
00:51:13,637 --> 00:51:14,738
This is just...

722
00:51:16,106 --> 00:51:18,041
Just nerves.

723
00:51:18,108 --> 00:51:20,811
-Talk to me. -About what?

724
00:51:20,877 --> 00:51:23,146
Anything.

725
00:51:23,213 --> 00:51:25,282
What's the first
thing you want to do

726
00:51:25,348 --> 00:51:28,051
when come off house arrest?

727
00:51:28,118 --> 00:51:30,554
Go for a run.

728
00:51:30,620 --> 00:51:32,689
I miss feeling the
wind on my face.

729
00:51:32,756 --> 00:51:35,292
I used to run up and
down this hill...

730
00:51:36,893 --> 00:51:39,663
until Michael decided
it was too dangerous.

731
00:51:41,131 --> 00:51:43,800
How did you meet him anyway?

732
00:51:43,867 --> 00:51:46,103
Sophia introduced us.

733
00:51:46,169 --> 00:51:49,272
Took me to a party at
this house, actually.

734
00:51:49,339 --> 00:51:51,475
Never thought I'd live here.

735
00:51:51,541 --> 00:51:53,276
That's enough about Michael.

736
00:51:53,343 --> 00:51:55,679
What about you?
What're your plans?

737
00:51:55,745 --> 00:51:59,249
Well, I've been so
focused on Cheyenne that

738
00:51:59,316 --> 00:52:02,219
I haven't thought
much beyond that.

739
00:52:02,285 --> 00:52:03,720
Do you have any leads?

740
00:52:03,787 --> 00:52:06,756
I searched her apartment
right before she went missing.

741
00:52:06,823 --> 00:52:09,493
And I got into her phone
records, there was a number

742
00:52:09,559 --> 00:52:11,528
that she was calling, but, uh...

743
00:52:11,595 --> 00:52:14,064
I haven't been able
to track it down.

744
00:52:14,131 --> 00:52:15,732
The number that
you asked me about?

745
00:52:15,799 --> 00:52:16,799
Yeah.

746
00:52:16,833 --> 00:52:18,568
Apparently, it's
from a burner phone.

747
00:52:18,635 --> 00:52:21,605
I gave that information
to the police and...

748
00:52:22,939 --> 00:52:25,342
they didn't do anything
with that either.

749
00:52:32,249 --> 00:52:33,917
Okay, that's our cue.

750
00:52:35,719 --> 00:52:36,719
Ready?

751
00:52:48,265 --> 00:52:49,900
Hey, Dex. He's upstairs.

752
00:52:49,966 --> 00:52:51,635
Are you ready?

753
00:52:57,307 --> 00:52:58,375
Let's go.

754
00:53:04,314 --> 00:53:05,682
You know how to pick locks too?

755
00:53:07,184 --> 00:53:08,351
Yeah.

756
00:53:12,222 --> 00:53:14,457
This one's a little tinier.

757
00:53:16,560 --> 00:53:19,596
I'm just really,
so good at this.

758
00:53:19,663 --> 00:53:22,165
Just, just a second, Bri.

759
00:53:22,232 --> 00:53:23,733
We'll be in no time.

760
00:53:57,734 --> 00:54:00,637
- This is your room?
- Once upon a time.

761
00:54:02,205 --> 00:54:04,307
Why, this piece of shit!

762
00:54:07,043 --> 00:54:08,043
Got it.

763
00:54:11,414 --> 00:54:13,416
Here's the system.

764
00:54:13,483 --> 00:54:14,627
Okay, but what am I looking for?

765
00:54:14,651 --> 00:54:16,753
It's a plastic or a metal box.

766
00:54:16,820 --> 00:54:19,289
But they're all
plastic and metal. Which one?

767
00:54:19,356 --> 00:54:20,657
The hard drive.

768
00:54:20,724 --> 00:54:22,025
Just look.

769
00:54:25,595 --> 00:54:27,364
This is the address
to the lake house.

770
00:54:27,430 --> 00:54:28,531
Well, that's it.

771
00:54:28,598 --> 00:54:30,400
The tape, the tape!

772
00:54:35,705 --> 00:54:38,708
Michael, did you get it working?

773
00:54:45,248 --> 00:54:47,350
"Let there be light."

774
00:54:49,486 --> 00:54:51,388
Now, where were we?

775
00:54:56,393 --> 00:54:57,761
Close the door, he's coming.

776
00:54:57,827 --> 00:54:59,763
-Close the door, go! -Ah!

777
00:55:06,102 --> 00:55:07,102
It's stuck.

778
00:55:30,360 --> 00:55:31,494
Did you open that?

779
00:55:31,561 --> 00:55:34,397
-Did you go in there? -No.

780
00:55:55,418 --> 00:55:56,462
Did you go through my things?

781
00:55:56,486 --> 00:55:58,054
No.

782
00:55:58,121 --> 00:56:00,132
I was literally in the shower
with you, the power went out

783
00:56:00,156 --> 00:56:01,358
and, and I stayed right here.

784
00:56:01,424 --> 00:56:02,659
I didn't go anywhere.

785
00:56:02,726 --> 00:56:05,862
Then why is the damn door open?

786
00:56:05,929 --> 00:56:07,797
I don't know.

787
00:56:07,864 --> 00:56:09,599
Well, I
didn't go in there.

788
00:56:09,666 --> 00:56:11,668
That leaves one other person.

789
00:56:11,735 --> 00:56:13,436
So don't talk to me
like I'm an idiot!

790
00:56:13,503 --> 00:56:15,405
Get your
hands off of me!

791
00:56:15,472 --> 00:56:17,240
That is my
private space, you have

792
00:56:17,307 --> 00:56:18,408
no right being in there.

793
00:56:18,475 --> 00:56:19,509
I wasn't.

794
00:56:19,576 --> 00:56:21,811
You can go screw yourself.

795
00:56:21,878 --> 00:56:22,812
I'm leaving.

796
00:56:22,879 --> 00:56:25,648
Shit! Wait,
Mackenzie. I'm sorry.

797
00:56:25,715 --> 00:56:28,618
Hold on a minute.
You don't have to go.

798
00:57:56,206 --> 00:57:57,807
Hello, Nancy?

799
00:57:59,909 --> 00:58:02,645
What do you mean
you can't see me?

800
00:58:10,019 --> 00:58:11,554
Ms. Collins?

801
00:58:14,290 --> 00:58:16,659
Hey, Nancy!

802
00:58:16,726 --> 00:58:19,128
Told you I was here.

803
00:58:19,195 --> 00:58:21,831
We've been here one too
many times, Ms. Collins.

804
00:58:21,898 --> 00:58:24,801
And your behavior is
increasingly erratic.

805
00:58:24,868 --> 00:58:25,945
I'm sorry. I told
you about the...

806
00:58:25,969 --> 00:58:28,238
That's no longer an excuse.

807
00:58:28,304 --> 00:58:31,241
Okay? I'm sorry. We went
over this. Cuff her.

808
00:58:31,307 --> 00:58:33,176
No, wait.

809
00:58:33,243 --> 00:58:34,744
Nancy, please.

810
00:58:34,811 --> 00:58:36,913
I've had a...

811
00:58:36,980 --> 00:58:41,050
a really, really rough year.

812
00:58:41,117 --> 00:58:43,386
I lost my husband,

813
00:58:43,453 --> 00:58:46,122
my home, my freedom.

814
00:58:47,457 --> 00:58:49,526
Ev-everything I've loved

815
00:58:49,592 --> 00:58:51,728
has been taken from me.

816
00:58:51,794 --> 00:58:54,030
But I'm here!

817
00:58:54,097 --> 00:58:56,799
I'm here where I'm
supposed to be.

818
00:58:56,866 --> 00:59:00,203
Please! Please! Just
give me one more chance.

819
01:00:11,507 --> 01:00:13,977
- Good morning.
- Morning to you, too.

820
01:00:14,043 --> 01:00:17,347
Hey, I love this kitchen.

821
01:00:17,413 --> 01:00:18,581
How was your night?

822
01:00:18,648 --> 01:00:22,318
Before or after
breaking and entering?

823
01:00:24,053 --> 01:00:27,890
Ah. So, the hard
drive is encrypted.

824
01:00:27,957 --> 01:00:29,892
I have to run it by Dex,

825
01:00:29,959 --> 01:00:32,862
and with any luck, we're
gonna have some answers soon.

826
01:00:34,063 --> 01:00:35,298
Great.

827
01:00:38,801 --> 01:00:41,170
Something I need you to know.

828
01:00:41,237 --> 01:00:43,339
I found this phone under
Michael's bed last night.

829
01:00:44,874 --> 01:00:46,442
It's a burner phone.

830
01:00:46,509 --> 01:00:50,613
It's the phone that Cheyenne was
calling when she disappeared.

831
01:00:50,680 --> 01:00:52,482
Hold on.

832
01:00:52,548 --> 01:00:53,850
Cheyenne was calling Michael?

833
01:00:53,916 --> 01:00:56,352
Cheyenne disappeared
at Sandpoint Lake.

834
01:00:56,419 --> 01:00:57,954
So that means, the
son of a bitch had

835
01:00:58,021 --> 01:00:59,789
something to do with it.

836
01:01:05,662 --> 01:01:09,032
Ah! That's Dex. I got to go. I'm
gonna go through the footage.

837
01:01:09,098 --> 01:01:11,134
-Wait, you're leaving? -Yeah.

838
01:01:12,769 --> 01:01:14,370
I'll be back soon.

839
01:01:14,437 --> 01:01:15,905
All right?

840
01:01:21,477 --> 01:01:25,114
Have there been any incidents
since I saw you last?

841
01:01:25,181 --> 01:01:27,216
Break-ins, things like that?

842
01:01:29,519 --> 01:01:30,920
Oh, plenty.

843
01:01:30,987 --> 01:01:33,389
Probably just the
house settling, though.

844
01:01:36,526 --> 01:01:40,063
I understand you've been working
with Xavier Johnson recently?

845
01:01:40,129 --> 01:01:44,200
I didn't have a lot of options
after you guys turned me down.

846
01:01:44,267 --> 01:01:45,902
Have you had any
issues with him?

847
01:01:45,968 --> 01:01:48,438
Why would I have issues?

848
01:01:48,504 --> 01:01:51,808
Are you familiar with his...

849
01:01:51,874 --> 01:01:53,409
criminal record?

850
01:01:53,476 --> 01:01:57,246
He's currently a suspect in the
disappearance of his sister,

851
01:01:57,313 --> 01:01:59,348
Cheyenne Clark.

852
01:01:59,415 --> 01:02:02,085
We're building a
case against him.

853
01:02:02,151 --> 01:02:05,888
But if I were you,
I'd keep my distance.

854
01:02:08,491 --> 01:02:10,059
I don't understand.

855
01:02:10,126 --> 01:02:13,496
Xavier isn't a criminal.
He's private security.

856
01:02:13,563 --> 01:02:16,399
That background is part of
what makes him so dangerous.

857
01:02:18,267 --> 01:02:19,969
How did you get that
black eye, Ms...

858
01:02:20,036 --> 01:02:21,804
What about Michael?

859
01:02:21,871 --> 01:02:23,873
Is he involved in
the Cheyenne case?

860
01:02:23,940 --> 01:02:25,150
Well, he was a
person of interest.

861
01:02:25,174 --> 01:02:26,642
But we cleared him quickly.

862
01:02:26,709 --> 01:02:28,778
-Air-tight alibi.
-Which was what?

863
01:02:28,845 --> 01:02:30,213
-A work trip. -Oh...

864
01:02:30,279 --> 01:02:33,850
Corroborated by several
of his colleagues.

865
01:02:33,916 --> 01:02:36,352
Does that sound right to you?

866
01:02:36,419 --> 01:02:39,422
He did a lot of things
I wasn't aware of.

867
01:02:39,489 --> 01:02:41,891
I didn't even know
he knew Cheyenne.

868
01:02:44,861 --> 01:02:48,064
I know this is a lot to take in.

869
01:02:49,165 --> 01:02:51,601
But you can trust me.

870
01:02:51,667 --> 01:02:54,036
My only priority is your safety.

871
01:02:56,472 --> 01:02:58,407
Mr. Johnson has a
history of violence.

872
01:02:58,474 --> 01:03:01,410
I don't know how he'll
react if he's pushed.

873
01:03:04,747 --> 01:03:06,249
Ms. Collins?

874
01:03:07,917 --> 01:03:10,353
Ms. Collins?

875
01:03:10,419 --> 01:03:13,422
Do you understand what
I'm saying to you?

876
01:03:18,394 --> 01:03:20,096
Detective Hall.

877
01:03:23,199 --> 01:03:24,199
Ah-huh.

878
01:03:25,802 --> 01:03:27,470
I'll be right there.

879
01:03:30,273 --> 01:03:32,642
Michael was just struck
in a hit-and-run.

880
01:03:32,708 --> 01:03:34,043
He's enroute to the hospital.

881
01:03:34,110 --> 01:03:36,579
Witnesses say an
RV fled the scene.

882
01:03:36,646 --> 01:03:37,847
Uh...

883
01:03:37,914 --> 01:03:40,483
What? What do you mean?

884
01:03:40,550 --> 01:03:41,884
Wait, what do I do?

885
01:03:41,951 --> 01:03:45,888
Well, sit still. Is there
someone you can call

886
01:03:45,955 --> 01:03:47,623
to be with you?

887
01:03:50,193 --> 01:03:52,195
Did Xavier do this?

888
01:03:53,796 --> 01:03:56,132
No. I don't think so.

889
01:03:57,767 --> 01:03:59,302
But now I have no idea.

890
01:03:59,368 --> 01:04:02,538
Especially after everything
that's happened to Michael.

891
01:04:03,940 --> 01:04:06,209
Xavier did have a lot to gain.

892
01:04:06,275 --> 01:04:07,677
The man showed up in an old RV

893
01:04:07,743 --> 01:04:10,646
and now he's living
in your lakeside home.

894
01:04:11,981 --> 01:04:14,417
You didn't sleep
with him, did you?

895
01:04:38,007 --> 01:04:39,442
Ah. Hey.

896
01:04:40,843 --> 01:04:42,411
I've been calling you.

897
01:04:42,478 --> 01:04:44,247
Listen, Dex finally
cracked this.

898
01:04:48,651 --> 01:04:50,186
Somethin' wrong?

899
01:04:50,253 --> 01:04:52,455
What happened to your mirror?

900
01:04:55,091 --> 01:04:57,526
It was like that when
I left Dex's house.

901
01:04:57,593 --> 01:04:59,562
I don't know. I
didn't see it happen.

902
01:04:59,629 --> 01:05:02,798
And why do you have those
polaroid's of Cheyenne?

903
01:05:02,865 --> 01:05:05,568
They look just like the
pictures that were taken of me.

904
01:05:05,635 --> 01:05:09,205
I got those from
Cheyenne's apartment.

905
01:05:09,272 --> 01:05:11,374
Those are the last
pictures I have of her.

906
01:05:12,775 --> 01:05:14,377
I want to thank you.

907
01:05:14,443 --> 01:05:15,912
Really.

908
01:05:15,978 --> 01:05:18,614
But I think that we
should stop this.

909
01:05:18,681 --> 01:05:20,283
What? Working together?

910
01:05:21,784 --> 01:05:23,286
Or us?

911
01:05:25,955 --> 01:05:27,657
Both.

912
01:05:27,723 --> 01:05:29,692
Bri.

913
01:05:29,759 --> 01:05:32,194
I don't know what's
going on with you.

914
01:05:32,261 --> 01:05:34,497
But all I've tried
to do was help you.

915
01:05:35,665 --> 01:05:38,267
We are so close to
figuring this out.

916
01:05:39,702 --> 01:05:42,772
And I don't want what
happened to Cheyenne

917
01:05:42,838 --> 01:05:44,307
to happen to you.

918
01:05:49,946 --> 01:05:52,114
I put your things in a box.

919
01:05:53,616 --> 01:05:55,651
You should leave.

920
01:05:55,718 --> 01:05:56,718
Bri.

921
01:05:58,587 --> 01:06:01,757
Oh, um, you're
better on your own.

922
01:06:01,824 --> 01:06:03,859
Right?

923
01:06:03,926 --> 01:06:05,528
Well, here.

924
01:06:05,594 --> 01:06:07,430
This belongs to you.

925
01:06:28,017 --> 01:06:29,485
You did the right thing.

926
01:06:29,552 --> 01:06:31,187
We have an officer
watching Mr. Johnson

927
01:06:31,253 --> 01:06:33,255
while we move
forward on an arrest.

928
01:06:33,322 --> 01:06:34,466
He won't come
anywhere near there

929
01:06:34,490 --> 01:06:36,192
without being intercepted.

930
01:06:38,127 --> 01:06:40,129
Thank you, detective.

931
01:06:40,196 --> 01:06:44,533
I'm sorry... for all-all this.

932
01:06:44,600 --> 01:06:47,136
Listen to me.
Someone has a plan in mind,

933
01:06:47,203 --> 01:06:49,171
they're gonna make it happen.

934
01:06:49,238 --> 01:06:50,906
That's not on you.

935
01:06:50,973 --> 01:06:52,742
You're safe now.

936
01:06:55,311 --> 01:06:59,215
Like the detective said,
he won't come near here.

937
01:06:59,281 --> 01:07:01,317
Look, let's take your
mind off of this.

938
01:07:01,384 --> 01:07:02,861
I'm going to go change
into some sweats

939
01:07:02,885 --> 01:07:06,055
and then let's watch
some trashy TV, okay?

940
01:07:27,910 --> 01:07:32,348
Detective, Xavier's RV
is outside of my house.

941
01:07:32,415 --> 01:07:34,717
You said you would have
a cop on him by now.

942
01:07:36,452 --> 01:07:37,520
Sofia!

943
01:07:38,954 --> 01:07:40,122
Oh...

944
01:08:52,495 --> 01:08:55,297
Michael Miller. County
Sheriff's Department.

945
01:08:56,732 --> 01:08:57,732
Hello?

946
01:09:05,174 --> 01:09:07,676
Hi. What's goin' on?

947
01:09:07,743 --> 01:09:10,346
Uh, the hospital called
regarding a hit-and-run.

948
01:09:10,412 --> 01:09:12,515
Do you have a moment?

949
01:09:12,581 --> 01:09:14,259
Look, I already went through
this with the other guy,

950
01:09:14,283 --> 01:09:15,651
the detective.

951
01:09:15,718 --> 01:09:17,386
Detective?

952
01:09:17,453 --> 01:09:20,422
Yeah, one of you guys from
the sheriff's department.

953
01:09:20,489 --> 01:09:22,658
Uh, do you remember
who you spoke with?

954
01:09:23,659 --> 01:09:25,161
Joe Hall.

955
01:09:25,227 --> 01:09:27,296
Joe Hall. Uh...

956
01:09:27,363 --> 01:09:29,198
You ever heard of him?

957
01:09:29,265 --> 01:09:31,066
Sir, there is no
Detective Joe Hall

958
01:09:31,133 --> 01:09:32,144
from the sheriff's department.

959
01:09:39,175 --> 01:09:40,876
Who are you?

960
01:09:49,451 --> 01:09:51,854
That depends on who you ask.

961
01:09:51,921 --> 01:09:53,923
Or who's paying.

962
01:09:53,989 --> 01:09:55,925
But you can call me Joe.

963
01:09:57,026 --> 01:09:58,794
Where's Sofia?

964
01:09:58,861 --> 01:10:01,797
Uh, you don't need to
worry about her anymore.

965
01:10:05,267 --> 01:10:07,136
What do you want from me?

966
01:10:07,203 --> 01:10:09,572
I don't want anything from you.

967
01:10:14,777 --> 01:10:17,279
You ever had a
cockroach problem?

968
01:10:18,514 --> 01:10:20,516
Uh, probably not with
a house this nice.

969
01:10:20,583 --> 01:10:23,485
But the shithole I grew up in,

970
01:10:23,552 --> 01:10:25,721
had 'em everywhere.

971
01:10:25,788 --> 01:10:28,591
They're persistent
little bastards.

972
01:10:28,657 --> 01:10:31,527
Impossible to kill unless
you got a good plan.

973
01:10:31,594 --> 01:10:33,529
Turns out, your little
boyfriend over here

974
01:10:33,596 --> 01:10:35,631
is pretty persistent too.

975
01:10:37,967 --> 01:10:39,568
That Cheyenne girl...

976
01:10:40,769 --> 01:10:42,271
she's dead.

977
01:10:43,772 --> 01:10:47,876
I weighed her down and dumped
her right into that lake.

978
01:10:47,943 --> 01:10:52,481
I take down every one of the
posters of her around town.

979
01:10:52,548 --> 01:10:53,816
It's not that I need to.

980
01:10:53,882 --> 01:10:56,885
Nobody cares about her
any more, except him.

981
01:10:59,054 --> 01:11:01,323
He keeps on pushing it.

982
01:11:01,390 --> 01:11:03,993
So, he's got to go.

983
01:11:06,428 --> 01:11:08,430
Is he dead?

984
01:11:11,967 --> 01:11:13,902
Not yet.

985
01:11:13,969 --> 01:11:17,239
But with the amount of
dope I shot him up with...

986
01:11:17,306 --> 01:11:19,241
he should be close.

987
01:11:19,308 --> 01:11:22,911
In the end, he'll look like
a war vet turned drug addict

988
01:11:22,978 --> 01:11:26,649
who couldn't handle his
girlfriend breaking up with him.

989
01:11:26,715 --> 01:11:29,485
So he got high as a helicopter

990
01:11:29,551 --> 01:11:33,656
and killed her before
taking his own life.

991
01:11:36,125 --> 01:11:37,660
Tragic.

992
01:11:44,199 --> 01:11:46,735
Between you and me,

993
01:11:46,802 --> 01:11:49,638
I feel really bad
involving you in all this.

994
01:11:51,206 --> 01:11:53,442
Honestly, I respect you.

995
01:11:55,411 --> 01:11:59,315
Getting all this just for
banging a guy for a few years.

996
01:12:01,350 --> 01:12:03,218
Now that's a scam.

997
01:12:03,285 --> 01:12:05,821
They call me a con man, but you,

998
01:12:05,888 --> 01:12:09,758
you robbed your husband
blind and played the victim.

999
01:12:09,825 --> 01:12:13,462
Pfft. Now that takes balls.

1000
01:12:15,998 --> 01:12:16,998
Well...

1001
01:12:22,071 --> 01:12:25,007
I hope you enjoyed it
all while it lasted.

1002
01:12:29,278 --> 01:12:31,814
I'll make it quick.

1003
01:12:31,880 --> 01:12:33,549
Promise.

1004
01:12:33,615 --> 01:12:35,617
It won't hurt at all.

1005
01:12:38,887 --> 01:12:39,887
Please.

1006
01:12:41,256 --> 01:12:42,591
Please don't do this.

1007
01:12:44,126 --> 01:12:45,160
You don't have to do.

1008
01:12:46,695 --> 01:12:50,165
Hmm!
I love this song!

1009
01:12:50,232 --> 01:12:51,967
Hmm!

1010
01:12:57,973 --> 01:12:58,741
Thank you.

1011
01:13:04,413 --> 01:13:05,581
Wait.

1012
01:13:07,416 --> 01:13:10,386
Can I just say one last thing?

1013
01:13:19,061 --> 01:13:20,062
No.

1014
01:13:34,143 --> 01:13:36,545
Xavier. Xavier!

1015
01:13:38,280 --> 01:13:39,648
Oh!

1016
01:13:42,718 --> 01:13:44,486
No!

1017
01:13:46,088 --> 01:13:47,389
No!

1018
01:13:49,291 --> 01:13:50,626
No!

1019
01:13:50,692 --> 01:13:52,161
Oh, my God...

1020
01:13:53,996 --> 01:13:57,366
-Ah! -Leave her alone!

1021
01:14:08,577 --> 01:14:10,245
Oh, you're gonna regret this.

1022
01:14:11,680 --> 01:14:14,216
Now I'm gonna make you feel it.

1023
01:14:53,789 --> 01:14:56,325
Xavier, please, can you hold on?

1024
01:14:56,391 --> 01:14:58,060
-Hold on. -I'm okay.

1025
01:14:58,126 --> 01:14:59,995
I'm okay, partner.

1026
01:15:15,310 --> 01:15:18,146
Sophia! Sophia! Sophia!

1027
01:15:18,213 --> 01:15:19,213
Sophia?

1028
01:15:20,549 --> 01:15:21,750
So-Sofia?

1029
01:15:25,187 --> 01:15:27,222
Oh, my God! Sofia!

1030
01:15:27,289 --> 01:15:28,991
Sofia...

1031
01:15:33,028 --> 01:15:34,028
Help!

1032
01:16:09,831 --> 01:16:12,401
I was going through
the hard drive.

1033
01:16:12,467 --> 01:16:14,870
Everything points back to Joe.

1034
01:16:16,505 --> 01:16:19,141
-So who was he? -Joe Mitchell.

1035
01:16:20,676 --> 01:16:23,011
He had a record.

1036
01:16:23,078 --> 01:16:24,680
Most recently for assault.

1037
01:16:24,746 --> 01:16:26,181
And...

1038
01:16:26,248 --> 01:16:28,650
when they pulled Cheyenne's
body out of the lake,

1039
01:16:28,717 --> 01:16:30,886
DNA was linked back to him.

1040
01:16:30,953 --> 01:16:34,323
-Xavier. -Hey, it's okay.

1041
01:16:34,389 --> 01:16:35,490
At least you're safe.

1042
01:16:35,557 --> 01:16:36,725
Why?

1043
01:16:38,493 --> 01:16:41,129
Why me? Why Cheyenne?

1044
01:16:41,196 --> 01:16:43,732
Sometimes there's
no explanation.

1045
01:16:45,033 --> 01:16:48,070
I feel like there's
something more.

1046
01:16:48,136 --> 01:16:50,872
It's time for us
both to move on.

1047
01:16:58,780 --> 01:17:00,782
I'll see you around.

1048
01:17:17,833 --> 01:17:20,202
How were you
controlling the house?

1049
01:17:55,771 --> 01:18:00,108
Oak-y with a finish of nutmeg.

1050
01:18:02,010 --> 01:18:04,379
You did a great job
cleaning up the place.

1051
01:18:04,446 --> 01:18:06,014
Wish I could've helped.

1052
01:18:07,049 --> 01:18:08,917
How're you feeling now?

1053
01:18:11,853 --> 01:18:16,124
Better than I have in
a long time, actually.

1054
01:18:16,191 --> 01:18:18,894
Starting to think about
what I'll do next.

1055
01:18:18,960 --> 01:18:21,229
Once I'm free.

1056
01:18:21,296 --> 01:18:23,298
I'm so glad.

1057
01:18:23,365 --> 01:18:24,399
So catch me up.

1058
01:18:24,466 --> 01:18:27,803
Did the police close
the investigation?

1059
01:18:27,869 --> 01:18:29,171
Yeah.

1060
01:18:29,237 --> 01:18:32,441
They wrapped it
up, and moved on.

1061
01:18:32,507 --> 01:18:35,043
Joe attacked me. And
it's pretty cut and dry.

1062
01:18:36,912 --> 01:18:40,215
There's just one thing

1063
01:18:40,282 --> 01:18:42,584
that I'm having trouble with.

1064
01:18:42,651 --> 01:18:44,386
And maybe you can help me.

1065
01:18:44,453 --> 01:18:46,822
Of course. Anything.

1066
01:18:46,888 --> 01:18:51,359
I know why Joe wanted
to kill Xavier.

1067
01:18:51,426 --> 01:18:53,128
But why was he after me?

1068
01:18:54,629 --> 01:18:56,364
Why pretend to be a cop at all?

1069
01:18:58,133 --> 01:19:01,970
It's common to have questions
after something like this.

1070
01:19:02,037 --> 01:19:04,773
A lot of victims
struggle to find closure.

1071
01:19:06,274 --> 01:19:08,210
Maybe.

1072
01:19:08,276 --> 01:19:11,780
You must be relieved your
stalker's finally gone.

1073
01:19:11,847 --> 01:19:13,482
I would be...

1074
01:19:18,253 --> 01:19:21,056
But Joe wasn't my stalker.

1075
01:19:21,123 --> 01:19:23,391
At least, not the only one.

1076
01:19:24,893 --> 01:19:27,596
You were, Sofia.

1077
01:19:27,662 --> 01:19:29,364
The both of you.

1078
01:19:30,966 --> 01:19:33,401
Bri, that's ridiculous.

1079
01:19:33,468 --> 01:19:36,738
You said it yourself,
Joe attacked you.

1080
01:19:36,805 --> 01:19:40,108
-I don't know why.
-I think you do.

1081
01:19:40,175 --> 01:19:43,745
There's a common thread
between Xavier and Joe...

1082
01:19:43,812 --> 01:19:45,547
You.

1083
01:19:52,020 --> 01:19:53,855
Is that what this is about?

1084
01:19:53,922 --> 01:19:55,690
How was I supposed
to know? He...

1085
01:19:55,757 --> 01:20:00,262
Court records show that you
represented a Joseph Mitchell

1086
01:20:00,328 --> 01:20:04,633
in an assault case a
few years back, and won.

1087
01:20:04,699 --> 01:20:06,234
You both knew each other.

1088
01:20:07,469 --> 01:20:11,106
The firm represents
a lot of people, Bri.

1089
01:20:11,173 --> 01:20:13,408
And don't forget,
he attacked me too.

1090
01:20:13,475 --> 01:20:16,111
The cops found an
RV parked down the street

1091
01:20:16,178 --> 01:20:17,779
missing a mirror.

1092
01:20:17,846 --> 01:20:19,314
Just like Xavier's.

1093
01:20:19,381 --> 01:20:22,117
But it was registered to Joe.

1094
01:20:22,184 --> 01:20:24,619
And Xavier's RV was
at a friend's house

1095
01:20:24,686 --> 01:20:26,955
when the mirror was smashed.

1096
01:20:27,022 --> 01:20:29,057
I was at work.

1097
01:20:29,124 --> 01:20:31,660
I can have a dozen
colleagues vouch for me.

1098
01:20:31,726 --> 01:20:34,563
I assumed you
would cover your tracks.

1099
01:20:34,629 --> 01:20:38,133
But I didn't think
you'd be so bad at it.

1100
01:20:40,402 --> 01:20:43,872
Then again, you didn't
expect us to survive.

1101
01:20:46,041 --> 01:20:48,210
And Joe was with me
when Michael got hit.

1102
01:20:48,276 --> 01:20:49,276
So...

1103
01:20:50,345 --> 01:20:52,647
it must have been you driving.

1104
01:20:52,714 --> 01:20:55,951
Stop it. That's enough.

1105
01:20:56,017 --> 01:20:59,154
If you want to end a friendship
over a bunch of circumstantial

1106
01:20:59,221 --> 01:21:01,189
evidence, that's fine.

1107
01:21:03,291 --> 01:21:06,094
If you go down this
road, it's your loss.

1108
01:21:06,161 --> 01:21:07,696
House lock the doors.

1109
01:21:09,698 --> 01:21:11,666
Are you out of your mind?

1110
01:21:11,733 --> 01:21:15,770
I spent weeks looking
through the security footage

1111
01:21:15,837 --> 01:21:20,242
from the cameras that you
or I didn't know about.

1112
01:21:20,308 --> 01:21:21,576
You know what I found?

1113
01:21:26,081 --> 01:21:30,952
Michael saved some
really interesting clips.

1114
01:21:44,733 --> 01:21:46,468
You were screwing my husband.

1115
01:21:47,435 --> 01:21:50,405
That's what all this is about.

1116
01:21:50,472 --> 01:21:53,141
I knew you were in love
with him, I just didn't

1117
01:21:53,208 --> 01:21:56,077
think that you would
take it this far.

1118
01:21:59,381 --> 01:22:01,249
Is that why you had
Cheyenne killed?

1119
01:22:02,617 --> 01:22:06,955
You knew that Michael
would never let me go.

1120
01:22:07,022 --> 01:22:10,125
And Xavier would
never let Cheyenne go.

1121
01:22:10,191 --> 01:22:12,027
So you needed us both dead.

1122
01:22:14,262 --> 01:22:16,197
You'll never prove any of this.

1123
01:22:25,106 --> 01:22:27,042
I'll be right back.

1124
01:22:35,250 --> 01:22:38,153
Hey, Brianna. Uh, my
work trip got cut short.

1125
01:22:39,754 --> 01:22:43,058
Yeah, it was pretty boring.
I'll be home later tonight.

1126
01:22:44,359 --> 01:22:46,494
Bye. I love you, baby.

1127
01:22:49,130 --> 01:22:51,866
Hey, something came up
with work. I gotta go.

1128
01:22:51,933 --> 01:22:53,644
You got the login for the
app that controls the house.

1129
01:22:53,668 --> 01:22:56,604
You could just lock
up before you leave.

1130
01:22:56,671 --> 01:23:00,241
You knew how to control
the house from your phone.

1131
01:23:00,308 --> 01:23:01,819
But what you didn't
know was, you were just

1132
01:23:01,843 --> 01:23:03,945
a distraction for Michael.

1133
01:23:04,012 --> 01:23:06,281
You couldn't even
keep him happy.

1134
01:23:06,348 --> 01:23:08,483
That's why he needed me.

1135
01:23:08,550 --> 01:23:11,386
Is that what you told Joe
so that he could help you?

1136
01:23:12,988 --> 01:23:14,489
Or were you screwing him, too?

1137
01:23:15,924 --> 01:23:18,760
-Joe was simple.
-Not like Michael.

1138
01:23:21,062 --> 01:23:22,630
He loved me.

1139
01:23:24,132 --> 01:23:26,468
He wanted Cheyenne.

1140
01:23:26,534 --> 01:23:28,703
And he just merely tolerated you

1141
01:23:28,770 --> 01:23:30,872
because you made yourself easy.

1142
01:23:30,939 --> 01:23:33,475
Michael does love me!

1143
01:23:33,541 --> 01:23:35,643
He'll realize it
once you're gone.

1144
01:23:35,710 --> 01:23:39,014
And since Joe couldn't kill
you, I'll have to do it myself.

1145
01:23:39,080 --> 01:23:40,315
Remember when all this started

1146
01:23:40,382 --> 01:23:42,517
and you said that
this was a game.

1147
01:23:43,852 --> 01:23:45,587
Well, I'm playing.

1148
01:23:47,055 --> 01:23:53,094
This thing records audio when
it's being tampered with.

1149
01:23:53,161 --> 01:23:55,630
And I smashed it right
before you came over.

1150
01:23:57,198 --> 01:23:59,467
Clumsy me.

1151
01:23:59,534 --> 01:24:01,345
The police, they're on their
way right now, and they

1152
01:24:01,369 --> 01:24:03,772
heard everything
that you just said.

1153
01:24:03,838 --> 01:24:06,641
I never understood
what he saw in you.

1154
01:24:06,708 --> 01:24:09,077
You were always so needy.
With Michael, With me.

1155
01:24:11,880 --> 01:24:14,249
I do fine on my own.

1156
01:24:14,315 --> 01:24:16,355
And I'm pretty sure that
my lawyer sleeping with my

1157
01:24:16,418 --> 01:24:18,920
co-defendant is
pretty good grounds

1158
01:24:18,987 --> 01:24:21,322
to get my plea deal thrown out.

1159
01:24:21,389 --> 01:24:23,024
House, unlock the doors.

1160
01:24:28,229 --> 01:24:30,298
You didn't even need me.

1161
01:24:54,856 --> 01:24:56,624
Hey.

1162
01:24:56,691 --> 01:25:00,395
So I called that police
department up in Oakland.

1163
01:25:00,462 --> 01:25:03,364
Your man got an interview
next week.

1164
01:25:03,431 --> 01:25:06,267
-Yes! Congratulations.
-Thank you.

1165
01:25:06,334 --> 01:25:08,303
Where do you think you're goin'?

1166
01:25:08,369 --> 01:25:10,338
-Hm? -Out.

1167
01:25:12,073 --> 01:25:13,775
We still have to pack.

1168
01:25:13,842 --> 01:25:15,376
You still have to pack.

1169
01:25:20,348 --> 01:25:21,516
I'm packin'.
