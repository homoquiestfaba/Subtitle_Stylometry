00:12:50,678 --> 00:12:52,177
That'll help us with the bank.

344
00:12:52,179 --> 00:12:53,178
He said, "maybe."

345
00:12:53,180 --> 00:12:54,680
Yeah, but he winked
when he said it.

346
00:12:54,682 --> 00:12:56,181
He's only got one eye.

347
00:12:56,183 --> 00:12:57,683
How do you know
it wasn't a blink?

348
00:12:57,685 --> 00:12:58,850
I can tell.

This is cool. It's so deep.

351
00:13:02,439 --> 00:13:03,939
It's like at any moment

352
00:13:03,941 --> 00:13:05,524
the Earth can just
swallow us up.

353
00:13:05,526 --> 00:13:07,025
Yeah...

354
00:13:07,027 --> 00:13:08,110

loves us so much.

have a backup restaurant,

356
00:13:10,247 --> 00:13:11,830
in case the Earth gets this one?

357
00:13:11,832 --> 00:13:13,332
BOB: Um, no. OLLIE: Oh.

358
00:13:13,334 --> 00:13:14,366
Louise, get away from the hole.

359
00:13:14,368 --> 00:13:15,918
Get away from
the hole. Please!

360
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:18,003
All right, I'm going upstairs
to go to the bathroom,

361
00:13:18,005 --> 00:13:19,454
and they said we
won't be able to flush

362
00:13:19,456 --> 00:13:21,006
while they're fixing
the water pipe,

363
00:13:21,008 --> 00:13:22,507
so, last one to go,

364
00:13:22,509 --> 00:13:24,009
I hope you had your shots,

365
00:13:24,011 --> 00:13:25,260
'cause it's gonna
get intense in there.

366
00:13:25,262 --> 00:13:26,845
TINA: I wanna go first.
Or at least not last.

367
00:13:26,847 --> 00:13:30,265

wanna be the cherry on top!

to pay the bank. Yep.

didn't call us back
about the rent.

00:14:11,008 --> 00:14:13,008
We still don't know what
kind of "maybe" that was.

Ninety percent of
"maybes" are yeses.

00:14:14,979 --> 00:14:16,511
Definitely not true.

379
00:14:16,513 --> 00:14:18,513
We've said "maybe" to
being in Teddy's book club

380
00:14:18,515 --> 00:14:19,982
so many times.

381
00:14:19,984 --> 00:14:21,984
Well, they fixed the
pipe, that's good, right?

382
00:14:21,986 --> 00:14:23,568

Hey, Mr. Mopey,

385
00:14:26,690 --> 00:14:28,690
what was that thing you told
me your mother used to say?

386
00:14:28,692 --> 00:14:30,692
I don't know. "Something
stinks in here"?

387
00:14:30,694 --> 00:14:32,694
No. It was like,
"Hope and grit

388

"keeps you out of
the you-know-what."

389

Oh, yeah. She did say that.

390
00:14:35,699 --> 00:14:37,199
I think she thought
that was very edgy.

391
00:14:37,201 --> 00:14:39,201
Well, it's true, too. Mm.

392
00:14:39,203 --> 00:14:40,202

those bulky jeans, uh,

to be more aerodynamic.

Oh, you're doing
it already. Great!

stuff in one place.

what I think it is?

My barrette-clace.

barrette and necklace.

I hate stopping.

So, why are you nervous
in your own fantasy?

439
00:16:00,334 --> 00:16:02,834

some doubts about real me,

00:16:03,837 --> 00:16:04,836

say these things.

lose your jeans

out if music is,

called me a baby.

Why did she call you a baby?

It was the dead
man's drop thing.

I didn't wanna do it.

00:18:13,050 --> 00:18:15,050
I was worried all my loose
change would fall out.

Okay.

505
00:18:16,553 --> 00:18:19,137
All right, fine. It's also
because of my hat. My ears.

guys have noticed,

that you mention it.

Chloe thinks that I'm
scared to not wear them.

Which is crazy. Totally.

512
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:31,483
And why's she dropping

these B-bombs on me
like it's nothing?

514
00:18:32,986 --> 00:18:34,986

00:23:51,888 --> 00:23:53,972
Isn't it the weirdest shaped
tooth you've ever seen?

688
00:23:53,974 --> 00:23:55,473
Okay, maybe not
too close. (GAGS)

689
00:23:55,475 --> 00:23:56,975
You can't handle the tooth!

690
00:23:56,977 --> 00:23:58,476
It was in my mouth, Tina!

691
00:23:58,478 --> 00:23:59,978
It's just, I think it's, like,

692
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:01,512
against the law for
you to have that.

693
00:24:01,514 --> 00:24:03,064
Don't worry. It's
just a souvenir.

694
00:24:03,066 --> 00:24:04,649
I'll keep it to myself.

695
00:24:04,651 --> 00:24:05,733
Check it, people.

696
00:24:05,735 --> 00:24:07,485
A dead man's tooth. (ALL GASP)

697
00:24:07,487 --> 00:24:09,103
And she's showing
the whole school.

698
00:24:09,105 --> 00:24:10,688
I went down to the
sinkhole at night,

699
00:24:10,690 --> 00:24:13,191
found a skeleton, this
tooth fell in my mouth.

700
00:24:13,193 --> 00:24:14,692
Did somebody say that's badass?

701
00:24:14,694 --> 00:24:16,194
Like the ultimate
dead man's drop?

702
00:24:16,196 --> 00:24:18,580
I mean, I guess,
maybe, I don't know.

703
00:24:18,582 --> 00:24:20,164
It was very dramatic,

704
00:24:20,166 --> 00:24:21,666
and we got it all on tape. Oh!

705
00:24:21,668 --> 00:24:23,167
But we gotta get it
transferred to a format

706
00:24:23,169 --> 00:24:24,619
that anyone else
in the world has.

707
00:24:24,621 --> 00:24:26,170
I think my dad h as
that kinda player.

708
00:24:26,172 --> 00:24:27,839
This just looks like that kind.

709
00:24:27,841 --> 00:24:28,923
Questions?

710
00:24:28,925 --> 00:24:30,425
Oh, my God, Eli put his retainer

711
00:24:30,427 --> 00:24:32,427
on a chain and gave it to you?

712
00:24:32,429 --> 00:24:33,928
So romantic.

713
00:24:33,930 --> 00:24:35,930
Yeah, we're gonna be summer
boyfriend-girlfriend.

TAMMY: Where's your pager?

time to bring this baby out.

Cafeteria, pretty
magical setting.

719
00:24:44,357 --> 00:24:47,442
Just gotta untangle
it a little bit,

720
00:24:47,444 --> 00:24:49,394
and then it's time for
that special moment.

721
00:24:49,396 --> 00:24:50,812
JIMMY JR.: Hey, Zeke, throw
a chicken nugget in my mouth.

722
00:24:50,814 --> 00:24:51,896
Okay.

723
00:24:51,898 --> 00:24:53,398
Ow. Throw it again.

724
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:54,732
Ow. Throw it again.

725
00:24:54,734 --> 00:24:55,733
God, he's still trying to catch

726
00:24:55,735 --> 00:24:57,235
that chicken nugget
in his mouth.

727
00:24:57,237 --> 00:24:58,403
His whole eighth grade year.

728
00:24:58,405 --> 00:24:59,988
Ow. Throw it again. Should
we just not do this?

729
00:24:59,990 --> 00:25:01,489
No, I wanna be able to say

730
00:25:01,491 --> 00:25:02,490
I caught a chicken
nug get in my mouth.

731
00:25:02,492 --> 00:25:03,992
More than anything.

732
00:25:03,994 --> 00:25:05,493
Otherwise, this has
all been a waste.

733
00:25:05,495 --> 00:25:06,744
I see your point.
We'll get you there.

He's got a lot going on.

735
00:25:10,750 --> 00:25:13,167
But still excited
about this. Whoo-hoo.

736
00:25:13,169 --> 00:25:15,753
And that's why I'm starting
my foundation, Sinkhole Kids.

737

It's to help kids who've
been in sinkholes.

It changes you. Some
people can't handle it.

Fourth graders, why are
you not sitting down?

740
00:25:21,895 --> 00:25:22,810
Or are you sitting?

It's hard to tell.
You're all so small.

00:25:27,150 --> 00:25:28,650
where'd you get your hat?

745
00:25:28,652 --> 00:25:30,101
I want to get one like
that for my niece.

she loves bunnies.

Back off, Labonz.

748
00:25:33,823 --> 00:25:35,323
What? I'm trying
to cheer her up.

749

nutritious meal?

laughing. I'll laugh at her.

00:25:48,505 --> 00:25:49,754
She's not gonna laugh at me.

756
00:25:49,756 --> 00:25:50,705
What? Nothing.

757
00:25:50,707 --> 00:25:53,257
Okay, uh, call me
back. Thank you. Bye.

758
00:25:53,259 --> 00:25:55,760
So, how many times is it okay

759
00:25:55,762 --> 00:25:57,211
to call your landlord
and leave a message?

760
00:25:57,213 --> 00:25:58,796
Depends. Does he
like-like you?

761
00:25:58,798 --> 00:26:00,298
I still can't believe
we were livin'

762
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:01,799
above a dead body
this whole time.

763
00:26:01,801 --> 00:26:02,800
I couldn't even tell.

764
00:26:02,802 --> 00:26:04,302
I wonder who the skeleton was.

I can't think of any
other dead people.

767
00:26:08,308 --> 00:26:11,192
Well, whoever it was, they
were murdered to death,

768
00:26:11,194 --> 00:26:14,062
then buried to death
by a murderer-burier.

769
00:26:14,064 --> 00:26:15,646

him one more time.

the bank's money.

sold any burgers

talking about our hole.

that a suspect is being
taken into custody tonight.

Now they'll un-crime scene
our hole and fill it in.

794

And Mr. Fischoeder
will call us back too,

795
00:26:56,489 --> 00:26:57,989
and he'll tell us we
can slide on the rent,

796
00:26:57,991 --> 00:26:59,490
and we'll be on easy street.

big hole in it, huh?

00:28:44,681 --> 00:28:45,763
Oh, yeah? I couldn't tell.

860
00:28:45,765 --> 00:28:48,266
It's just our landlord's
gonna go to prison.

861
00:28:48,268 --> 00:28:49,767
The bank's gonna
call in our loan,

862
00:28:49,769 --> 00:28:51,269
and then they'll take
our restaurant stuff,

863
00:28:51,271 --> 00:28:53,271
and we will live in
a box on the street.

864
00:28:53,273 --> 00:28:54,689
This is what's gonna happen.

865

Oh, Bob, I need you.
The kids need you.

866
00:28:57,143 --> 00:28:58,726
What do you mean? You
and the kids need me

867
00:28:58,728 --> 00:29:00,111
to not go out of business.

868
00:29:00,113 --> 00:29:02,697
No. Going out of business
down there is not as bad

869
00:29:02,699 --> 00:29:04,866
as going out of
business in there.

870

is in there? Dreamy Bob.

to open a restaurant

875

I did not say "cuckoo
crazy" burgers.

880
00:29:21,417 --> 00:29:22,750
I would not say that.

Super funky burgers.

Well, no matter what I said,

I think that may be
Dreamy Bob is dumb

884
00:29:28,341 --> 00:29:30,808
and Droopy Bob just kinda
sees things the way they are.

gotta do to Droopy Bob?

Um, what?

887

the nuts, like this.

Ow! Sorry, sorry, sorry.

889
00:29:36,182 --> 00:29:38,182
But you know what I'm
saying. It's like a metaphor.

890
00:29:38,184 --> 00:29:39,684
Like this. Ow!

891
00:29:39,686 --> 00:29:42,186
Stop! It's not a metaphor
if you actually do it.

00:29:42,188 --> 00:29:43,187
Yes, it is.

is innocent.

that wink in the bank.

talking last night.

The restaurant is
in big trouble.

Boy trouble? Girl
trouble? All the trouble.

919

Mr. Fischoeder
can't go to prison.

920

If he does, Mom and
Dad won't be able

No more restaurant.

00:30:39,412 --> 00:30:41,412
And what are we gonna do
with Mom and Dad after school

924
00:30:41,414 --> 00:30:42,413
if there's no more restaurant?

925

But the good news is,

927

I think Mr. Fischoeder
is innocent.

928
00:30:47,587 --> 00:30:49,837
Innocent? But what
about how guilty he is?

929
00:30:49,839 --> 00:30:51,922
Well, why was he so
relaxed about that hole?

930
00:30:51,924 --> 00:30:54,425
If you had buried a
guy in that exact spot,

931

wouldn't you be a little
more anxious to fill it in?

Or at least go sneak
that sucker out of there

We need to gather evidence,
talk to witnesses.

00:31:08,992 --> 00:31:10,241
We need to start now.

But, Louise, if you don't think

942
00:31:11,277 --> 00:31:12,827
Mr. Fischoeder
did it, who did?

943
00:31:12,829 --> 00:31:13,828
Here's what I'm thinking.

944
00:31:13,830 --> 00:31:15,830
This was actually a beef
between two carnies.

Beef con carnie.

with Cotton Candy Dan,

you just got away with murder.

949
00:31:22,372 --> 00:31:23,921
So, what do we do
with that theory?

950
00:31:23,923 --> 00:31:25,373
Turn it into a graphic novel.

to our old pal Mickey.

He's a carnie now.

the carnie gossip.

just remembered

1218

Is there something
we can do for you?

1230
00:40:35,007 --> 00:40:37,724
You were asking who wanted
to kill Cotton Candy Dan?

1231
00:40:37,726 --> 00:40:38,809
No, I mean, before.

1232
00:40:38,811 --> 00:40:40,344
But not anymore.
We've moved on.

1233
00:40:40,346 --> 00:40:41,929
I got something to tell you.

1234
00:40:41,931 --> 00:40:43,430
I didn't wanna
say it back there.

1235
00:40:43,432 --> 00:40:45,065
They don't wanna hear
what I gotta say.

1236
00:40:45,067 --> 00:40:46,149
We're listening.

1237
00:40:46,151 --> 00:40:47,351
But maybe not
making eye contact.

1238
00:40:47,353 --> 00:40:48,936
I was there that
night, you know?

1239
00:40:48,938 --> 00:40:50,654
The last night anyone saw Dan.

1240
00:40:50,656 --> 00:40:51,738
You were? Yeah.

1241
00:40:51,740 --> 00:40:53,857
We were playing lucky
ducky on the wharf.

1242
00:40:53,859 --> 00:40:55,442
And sure, Dan and
Mr. Fischoeder

1243
00:40:55,444 --> 00:40:56,944
got into a big fight.

1244
00:40:56,946 --> 00:40:58,946
Mr. Fischoeder started
throwing ducks at Dan's head.

1245
00:40:58,948 --> 00:41:01,331
He kept yelling "duck,"
and it was confusing.

1246
00:41:01,333 --> 00:41:02,532
I can see that.

1247
00:41:02,534 --> 00:41:03,617
Anyway, after the
game, I went back

1248
00:41:03,619 --> 00:41:05,118
'cause I forgot my stress ball.

1249
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:07,537
And it's just Dan,
Mr. Fischoeder,

1250
00:41:07,539 --> 00:41:09,039
and Felix Fischoeder,

1251
00:41:09,041 --> 00:41:10,540
and they're yelling
at each other,

1252
00:41:10,542 --> 00:41:12,009
and they're all throwing ducks.

1253
00:41:12,011 --> 00:41:13,760
Wait. Felix was at the game?

1254
00:41:13,762 --> 00:41:14,845
No. He wasn't.

1255
00:41:14,847 --> 00:41:17,347
Mr. Fischoeder doesn't
let him play lucky ducky

1256
00:41:17,349 --> 00:41:18,849
because Felix gives
all the duckies

1257
00:41:18,851 --> 00:41:20,350
different voices
and personalities

1258
00:41:20,352 --> 00:41:21,852
and it makes it take a while.

1259
00:41:21,854 --> 00:41:23,854
That's why it was weird that
he showed up that night.

1260
00:41:23,856 --> 00:41:25,355
But nobody back
there wants to hear

1261
00:41:25,357 --> 00:41:27,274
that maybe Mr. Fischoeder
didn't do it.

1262
00:41:27,276 --> 00:41:29,276
Oh, my God. Of course.

1263
00:41:29,278 --> 00:41:31,778
Felix Fischoeder.
It's so Felix.

1264
00:41:31,780 --> 00:41:33,780
He has access to
Mr. Fischoeder's gun.

1265
00:41:33,782 --> 00:41:35,282
He was fighting with
both Mr. Fischoeder

1266
00:41:35,284 --> 00:41:36,783
and Cotton Candy Dan.

1267
00:41:36,785 --> 00:41:39,286
And most importantly,
he has a motive.

1268
00:41:39,288 --> 00:41:41,788
He has a motive to
frame his brother.

1269
00:41:41,790 --> 00:41:43,290
Because he's mad

1270
00:41:43,292 --> 00:41:45,292
Mr. Fischoeder doesn't like
his lucky ducky voices?

1271
00:41:45,294 --> 00:41:46,793
No, because I bet you

1272
00:41:46,795 --> 00:41:49,296
if Mr. Fischoeder goes to
jail, Felix gets his money.

1273
00:41:49,298 --> 00:41:50,664
We gotta go to the cops.

1274
00:41:50,666 --> 00:41:53,250
Oh. Uh, mind if I
don't go to the cops?

1275
00:41:53,252 --> 00:41:55,252
I have to pick up
my dry cleaning,

1276
00:41:55,254 --> 00:41:56,253
because it's dry now.

1277
00:41:56,255 --> 00:41:57,554
LOUISE: Yeah, no
problem. Okay.

1278
00:41:57,556 --> 00:41:58,639

let's go, let's go.

carnie. Love you. Bye.

1280
00:42:00,643 --> 00:42:01,977

00:42:02,394 --> 00:42:04,311
TEDDY: Well, everything
fits perfectly.

1282
00:42:04,313 --> 00:42:05,395
What's this for?

1283
00:42:05,397 --> 00:42:06,396
Olive bar. What?

1284
00:42:06,398 --> 00:42:07,848
I thought you could
have imported olives,

1285
00:42:07,850 --> 00:42:09,266
and they could go there.

1286
00:42:09,268 --> 00:42:10,851
Oh. I'm not sure... While
you wait for a burger,

1287
00:42:10,853 --> 00:42:12,352
you help yourself to
an imported olive.

1288
00:42:12,354 --> 00:42:13,854
Okay.

1289
00:42:13,856 --> 00:42:15,355
I got these on my way
over. You can pay me later.

1290
00:42:15,357 --> 00:42:16,356
Mm. Mobile Bob Burger Mobile

1291
00:42:16,358 --> 00:42:18,358
is a little fancier than
restaurant Bob Burgers.

1292
00:42:18,360 --> 00:42:19,860
You'll get used to it.

1293
00:42:19,862 --> 00:42:21,194
Where's Linda? I feel like
she's missing all the fun

1294
00:42:21,196 --> 00:42:23,280
of us setting up
this cart together.

1295
00:42:23,282 --> 00:42:24,281
Ta-da!

1296
00:42:24,283 --> 00:42:25,615
What's happening? I get it.

1297
00:42:25,617 --> 00:42:27,084
No questions from this guy.

1298
00:42:27,086 --> 00:42:28,168
I'm the marketing department.

1299
00:42:28,170 --> 00:42:29,670
I took Gene's burger suit,

1300
00:42:29,672 --> 00:42:31,672
let out the crotch a
little bit, and bam.

1301
00:42:31,674 --> 00:42:33,674
I'll push the product,
while you push the cart.

1302
00:42:33,676 --> 00:42:35,175
But the bikini. It's summer.

1303
00:42:35,177 --> 00:42:37,678
And sex sells,
baby. Yeah, Bob.

1304
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:39,680
Is that sex? A burger
with a bikini on it?

1305
00:42:39,682 --> 00:42:41,183
Uh, yeah. LINDA: Mm-hmm.

1306
00:42:41,684 --> 00:42:42,683
Okay, let's do it.

1307
00:42:42,685 --> 00:42:44,217
Yay. All right.

1308
00:42:44,219 --> 00:42:45,802
I dreamt this. Oh.
No, don't tell us.

1309
00:42:45,804 --> 00:42:47,304
No, it was nice.

1310
00:42:47,306 --> 00:42:49,056
Linda wasn't in it. It was
just a burger in a bikini.

1311
00:42:49,058 --> 00:42:50,640
BOB: Yeah, still
don't tell us.

1312

00:42:58,400 --> 00:42:59,900
Holy smokes, you scared
me. Sorry. Sorry.

1315
00:42:59,902 --> 00:43:01,401
Don't sneak up on a cop.

1316
00:43:01,403 --> 00:43:02,903
That's our job. We
sneak up on you.

1317
00:43:02,905 --> 00:43:04,404
Why are you here?

1318
00:43:04,406 --> 00:43:06,907
We went to the police station,
where you live, I assume.

1319
00:43:06,909 --> 00:43:08,909
But nobody from Homicide
would talk to us.

1320
00:43:08,911 --> 00:43:09,910
So, then we went to
look for you in Robbery,

1321
00:43:09,912 --> 00:43:11,411
but they said you
were on a stakeout.

1322
00:43:11,413 --> 00:43:13,413
And they told you where I was?

1323
00:43:13,415 --> 00:43:14,915
They said you were
at a dangerous

1324
00:43:14,917 --> 00:43:15,916
biker gang headquarters,

1325
00:43:15,918 --> 00:43:17,417
and we said, "The
One Eyed Snakes"?

1326
00:43:17,419 --> 00:43:18,418
And they said, "Yeah,"

1327
00:43:18,420 --> 00:43:19,419
and we said, "Oh,
we know those guys."

1328
00:43:19,421 --> 00:43:20,420
And they were like, "What?"

1329
00:43:20,422 --> 00:43:21,922
And we were like, "Yeah,
they're really nice."

1330
00:43:21,924 --> 00:43:23,090
Get down, get down. (SHUSHING)

1331
00:43:23,092 --> 00:43:24,174

TINA: (WHISPERS) Gene.

1332
00:43:24,176 --> 00:43:26,893
GENE: (WHISPERING) Sorry.
We are also getting down.

1333
00:43:26,895 --> 00:43:28,478
What are we looking for?

1334
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:29,479
(WHISPERS) Bikers.

1335
00:43:29,481 --> 00:43:30,480
Right. But, doing what?

1336
00:43:30,482 --> 00:43:33,483
We got a tip that they stole
a bunch of karaoke machines,

1337
00:43:33,485 --> 00:43:35,986
and I'm watching to see if
they try and move the goods.

1338
00:43:35,988 --> 00:43:38,021
That doesn't seem like
their kind of crime.

that the police
have the wrong guy.

1345

Mr. Fischoeder didn't
kill Cotton Candy Dan.

1346
00:43:51,036 --> 00:43:52,536
His brother, Felix, did.

1347

supposed to be in that place

If Mr. Fischoeder
goes to jail,

1355
00:44:05,100 --> 00:44:06,099
the restaurant goes under.

1356
00:44:06,101 --> 00:44:07,100

found the other one.

they're hungry.

I'll take the cart
and go straight ahead.

that his brother framed him,

1747
00:56:21,169 --> 00:56:22,668

he built Wonder Wharf
on top of the old park,

1770
00:56:58,323 --> 00:57:00,039
and he hid this room away.

1771

01:05:03,307 --> 01:05:05,307
but I didn't know he
swallowed the damn thing.

2038
01:05:05,309 --> 01:05:07,559
And you have that weird
tooth for some reason,

2039
01:05:07,561 --> 01:05:08,894
and it matches my scar,

2040
01:05:08,896 --> 01:05:09,895
and now everyone thinks

2041
01:05:09,897 --> 01:05:10,863
I murdered him
just 'cause I did.

2042
01:05:10,865 --> 01:05:13,565
Unbelievable. You killed
Cotton Candy Andy?

Candy Andy Dan?

2044
01:05:15,536 --> 01:05:17,403
It's just... Never
mind. You framed me?

2045
01:05:17,405 --> 01:05:18,487
You're a terrible family lawyer.

2046
01:05:18,489 --> 01:05:20,572
And a selfish lover, I bet.

2047
01:05:20,574 --> 01:05:23,542
Well, we should
probably hit the road.

I don't know why we didn't put
that on in the first place.

2061
01:05:51,822 --> 01:05:52,855
Sorry we skipped school.

2062

We were saving the restaurant
and solving a murder.

reason to leave school.

And their bikes
were by some stairs.

2072

Yes, we know.

say your submarine

2132

isn't going to go to Cuba.

was gonna make it to Cuba?

Hmm, I think we
might have gotten

a little too excited
about the sub idea.

2139
01:08:33,484 --> 01:08:35,484

just an old ride?

2140
01:08:35,486 --> 01:08:36,935
Yes, it runs on tokens.

frame job, right?

2142

I mean, why bury
Cotton Candy Dan

2143
01:08:40,658 --> 01:08:42,658
in front of our restaurant
and then wait six years?

BELCHERS: Huh. TINA: Right.

2145
01:08:43,661 --> 01:08:45,244
I didn't bury him in
front of your restaurant.

2146
01:08:45,246 --> 01:08:47,746
And I didn't wanna
wait six years.

2147

(DRAMATICALLY) Six years.

2148
01:08:48,832 --> 01:08:50,082
Easy. Easy.

2149
01:08:50,084 --> 01:08:51,500
Maybe we should hold
off on the questions.

2150
01:08:51,502 --> 01:08:54,286
I had it all worked
out. A top-rate murder.

2151
01:08:54,288 --> 01:08:56,288
I shoot Mr. Carnie
with Calvin's gun.

2152
01:08:56,290 --> 01:08:57,289
I stick him in a pile of dirt,

2153
01:08:57,291 --> 01:08:58,790
or whatever yucky stuff

2154
01:08:58,792 --> 01:08:59,791
was near the entrance
to the wharf.

2155
01:08:59,793 --> 01:09:01,293
I leave the stupid
foot sticking out,

2156
01:09:01,295 --> 01:09:02,878
so someone would
be sure to see it.

2157
01:09:02,880 --> 01:09:03,962
But little did I know

2158
01:09:03,964 --> 01:09:05,464
that some numbskull
backhoe operator

2159
01:09:05,466 --> 01:09:07,466
working for the city was
gonna scoop up that pile

2160
01:09:07,468 --> 01:09:09,801
without even checking
for dead carnies.

2161
01:09:09,803 --> 01:09:10,886
I come back, I've got no body.

2162
01:09:10,888 --> 01:09:12,387
I didn't know where
they'd brought the dirt.

2163
01:09:12,389 --> 01:09:14,106

could go around asking,

anyone find any dead guys?

say, "don't give up."

that over and over,

We're on top of the water main.

The new section of pipe is
plastic. We lost a tire.

Never mind. Go on.

So the wheel breaks the pipe,

2583
01:23:17,567 --> 01:23:19,567

us out somehow?

2584
01:23:19,569 --> 01:23:21,569

01:33:02,902 --> 01:33:05,402
if you believe there's
no romance in the world.

2877
01:33:05,404 --> 01:33:07,488
And who wants to believe that?

2878
01:33:07,490 --> 01:33:08,822
Uh...

2879
01:33:08,824 --> 01:33:10,407
Now, I don't know
why I got so hung up

2880
01:33:10,409 --> 01:33:12,409
on the question I
was gonna ask anyway.

2881
01:33:12,411 --> 01:33:14,378
Mostly, I just
really wanna do this.

2882
01:33:14,380 --> 01:33:17,416
(BOTH MOANING)

2883
01:33:18,417 --> 01:33:19,883

01:33:27,676 --> 01:33:28,759
LOUISE: I'm gonna do it.

2887
01:33:28,761 --> 01:33:30,094
You think because you,
like, saved the wharf

2888
01:33:30,096 --> 01:33:30,928
or something, you're
all brave now?

2889
01:33:30,930 --> 01:33:32,679
Yeah. On three.

2890
01:33:32,681 --> 01:33:35,232
One, two, three.

2891
01:33:35,234 --> 01:33:37,317

2893
01:33:39,071 --> 01:33:40,654
Louise, reminding you that
you have detention today

2894
01:33:40,656 --> 01:33:42,156
because you skipped school.

2895
01:33:42,158 --> 01:33:43,657
Oh, my God, your ears fell off!

2896
01:33:43,659 --> 01:33:45,993
Okay. It's okay. What
do we do? What do we do?

2897
01:33:45,995 --> 01:33:47,244
It's fine. It's
not a big deal.

2898
01:33:47,246 --> 01:33:48,829
Emergency counsel session?

2899
01:33:48,831 --> 01:33:50,330
I can get puppets here so fast.

2900
01:33:50,332 --> 01:33:52,332
Ms. Labonz, will
you go to my office

2901
01:33:52,334 --> 01:33:54,168
and get Security Blanket Hank

2902
01:33:54,170 --> 01:33:56,286
and, oh, just
get them all. No.

2903
01:33:56,288 --> 01:33:57,871
Mr. Frond, I'm good.

2904
01:33:57,873 --> 01:33:59,873
Oh, really? MS.
LaBONZ: She's good.

2905
01:33:59,875 --> 01:34:01,375
Okay. I'm so proud of
you. LOUISE: Don't say

2906
01:34:01,377 --> 01:34:03,178
"you're so proud of me." Yep.

2907
01:34:04,180 --> 01:34:06,263
Is everybody ready
to do this again?

2908
01:34:06,265 --> 01:34:07,765
LINDA: Yeah. GENE:
Sure, Father.

2909

LOUISE: I mean, it seems
like you're making us.

2910
01:34:08,768 --> 01:34:10,050
Teddy did a good job.

2911
01:34:10,052 --> 01:34:11,135
Kind of. Right?

2912
01:34:11,137 --> 01:34:13,137
LINDA: Aw, banner.
I love banners.

GENE: Are we dead
set on "Burgers"?

2914
01:34:15,641 --> 01:34:17,141
I mean, is it too
late to change that?

2915
01:34:17,143 --> 01:34:18,642
TINA: Oh, yeah.
We could do wraps.

2916
01:34:18,644 --> 01:34:19,643
LOUISE: Or soup.

2917
01:34:19,645 --> 01:34:21,145
BOB: Mm. LINDA: Mm, soup.

2918

BOB: Oh, my God.
Everyone, back inside,

2920
01:34:24,650 --> 01:34:26,485
