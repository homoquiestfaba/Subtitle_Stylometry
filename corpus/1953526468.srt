THANK YOU.

515
00:26:42,368 --> 00:26:45,436
I JUST--IF YOU CAN GET ME
OUT OF HERE,

516
00:26:45,438 --> 00:26:47,638
I WOULD...

517
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:49,106
REALLY APPRECIATE IT.

518
00:26:49,108 --> 00:26:51,642
AND IT'S--
IT'S LIKE, UM,

519
00:26:51,644 --> 00:26:54,578
IT'S AMAZING KARMA

520
00:26:54,580 --> 00:26:55,813
WHEN YOU DO GOOD THINGS
FOR OTHER PEOPLE.

521
00:26:55,815 --> 00:26:57,481
- TEDDY, YOU ALREADY
KNOW THE RULES.

522

EVERY--IS IT YELLOW DAY?

526
00:27:13,198 --> 00:27:14,565
I'LL HAVE THE--

527
00:27:14,567 --> 00:27:16,533
I'LL HAVE THE--
THE CORN.

528
00:27:16,535 --> 00:27:18,402
WELL, IS THAT CORN?
WHAT IS THAT?

529
00:27:18,404 --> 00:27:21,138
CORN--CREAM OF CORN
OR CORN--CORN--

530
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:25,542
- THE--THE ACORN DOESN'T FALL
TOO FAR FROM THE TREE.

531
00:27:25,544 --> 00:27:27,444
- OKAY, I'LL HAVE
SOME OF THE CORN.

532
00:27:27,446 --> 00:27:28,712
THAT CORN THERE.

533
00:27:28,714 --> 00:27:31,148
AND SOME OF IT.
NOT A LOT.

534
00:27:31,150 --> 00:27:34,318
AND THEN, UM, I'M JUST HERE
FOR--TEMPORARILY.

535
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:36,820
AND, UH, ALL RIGHT,
I'LL HAVE, LIKE, A BEAN.

536
00:27:36,822 --> 00:27:38,722
BUT NO MORE THAN THAT.
I DON'T WANT THAT.

537
00:27:38,724 --> 00:27:40,357
AND I WOULD LIKE--
YOU KNOW WHAT?

538
00:27:40,359 --> 00:27:41,525
I'M JUST GONNA HAVE
SOME OF THE CORN.

539
00:27:41,527 --> 00:27:44,094
DEFINITELY NO CHEESE,
AND I'LL HAVE--

540
00:27:44,096 --> 00:27:47,164
THAT'S EXACTLY
WHAT I DIDN'T WANT.

541
00:27:47,166 --> 00:27:50,834
- HEY, JASON.

HELLO? MR. MAGOO?

547
00:28:07,820 --> 00:28:10,087
- YEAH, BUDDY.

548

[chuckles]

549
00:28:11,090 --> 00:28:14,091
- UH, ALL'S WELL
THAT ENDS WELL.

550
00:28:14,093 --> 00:28:17,428
- ALL RIGHT, JASON.

[light instrumental music]

552
00:28:23,803 --> 00:28:27,137
- UH, SIR...

553
00:28:27,139 --> 00:28:28,839
I WANTED TO ASK YOU...

554
00:28:28,841 --> 00:28:32,609
DO YOU THINK THAT MAYBE

555
00:28:32,611 --> 00:28:35,145
I COULD TAKE ROSE
TO THE SPRING DANCE?

556
00:28:35,147 --> 00:28:37,314
- WELL, HAVE YOU ASKED HER?
- NOT YET.

557
00:28:37,316 --> 00:28:40,117
I WAS GOING TO SEND HER
A TEXT LATER TONIGHT.

558
00:28:40,119 --> 00:28:42,820
- TEXT? WHY DON'T YOU
ASK HER IN PERSON?

559
00:28:42,822 --> 00:28:44,688
- WELL, I ONLY SEE HER
AT SCHOOL.

560
00:28:44,690 --> 00:28:46,423
SHE'S ALWAYS
WITH HER OTHER FRIENDS.

561
00:28:46,425 --> 00:28:48,759
- WELL, COME OVER, UH,
COME OVER FOR DINNER TONIGHT.

562
00:28:48,761 --> 00:28:50,094
- REALLY?

563
00:28:50,096 --> 00:28:51,128
- IT'S FAMILY DINNER.
COME OVER.

564
00:28:51,130 --> 00:28:53,163
WE ALWAYS HAVE FAMILY DINNER.

565
00:28:53,165 --> 00:28:56,100
- GREAT. I GET OFF AT 6:00.
I CAN HEAD RIGHT OVER.

566
00:28:56,102 --> 00:28:58,535
- THAT'S FANTASTIC.

567
00:29:31,169 --> 00:29:32,569
- TEDDY...
- HI.

568
00:29:32,571 --> 00:29:34,138
- I HAVE
REALLY HORRIBLE NEWS.

569
00:29:34,140 --> 00:29:36,406
- <i>YOU</i> HAVE HORRIBLE NEWS?
- YES.

570
00:29:36,408 --> 00:29:39,209
- SOON AS I GET OUT OF HERE,
MY WIFE'S GONNA KILL ME.

571
00:29:39,211 --> 00:29:43,213
- WAIT, WHAT?

572

- [sighs]

573
00:29:46,185 --> 00:29:48,519
ALL I WAS SUPPOSED TO DO
WAS DUCK IN,

574
00:29:48,521 --> 00:29:51,388
SIGN SOME PAPERS,
AND DUCK OUT--THAT WAS IT.

575
00:29:51,390 --> 00:29:53,490
- OKAY, UH, TEDDY,
I REALLY NEED YOU TO LISTEN.

576
00:29:53,492 --> 00:29:54,825
THEY'RE NOT GONNA LET ME
OUT OF HERE.

577
00:29:54,827 --> 00:29:58,295
- WELCOME TO MY WORLD.
- OKAY, TEDDY, I'M SERIOUS.

578
00:29:58,297 --> 00:30:00,631
THERE'S A DOCTOR
THAT I DON'T EVEN KNOW

579
00:30:00,633 --> 00:30:03,467
WHO CAME IN AND SIGNED A FORM
TO KEEP ME IN HERE.

580
00:30:03,469 --> 00:30:05,202
- TEDDY...
- YEAH?

581
00:30:05,204 --> 00:30:07,171
- CAN I TALK TO YOU
FOR A MINUTE, PLEASE?

582
00:30:07,173 --> 00:30:08,172
- RIGHT NOW?
OKAY. YEAH, SURE.

583
00:30:08,174 --> 00:30:12,476
SORRY.
JUST A MINUTE.

584
00:30:12,478 --> 00:30:14,478
I'M SORRY.

585

LET'S GO.

586
00:30:16,215 --> 00:30:19,349
- I'M COMIN', I'M COMIN'.
HE IS THE MAN.

587
00:30:19,351 --> 00:30:22,119
ALL RIGHT, SO DON'T WORRY,
I'M NOT GONNA--AGH!

588
00:30:22,121 --> 00:30:23,654
- LISTEN, I THOUGHT I TOLD YOU
TO STAY AWAY FROM DOLORES.

589

- [choking] WHAT ARE YOU--
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

590
00:30:26,792 --> 00:30:28,325
- LISTEN, IF I EVER CATCH YOU
TALKING TO HER AGAIN,

591
00:30:28,327 --> 00:30:30,127
I WILL LOCK YOU UP
IN SOLITARY CONFINEMENT
