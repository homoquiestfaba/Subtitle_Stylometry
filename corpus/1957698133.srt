Uh-huh. What? What did he say?

11
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:35,041
He wants to go to the NBA.

12
00:01:35,125 --> 00:01:36,750
- Yeah, that's why we're here.
- Mm-hmm.

13
00:01:37,416 --> 00:01:38,750
Very impressive. Tell him.

14
00:01:38,833 --> 00:01:41,666
- [translates to Serbian]
- Just a big man who makes shots.

[continues translating to Serbian]

17
00:01:46,458 --> 00:01:50,125
And be a force,
he would be a powerhouse in the league.

18
00:01:51,041 --> 00:01:53,875
I do have to ask something.

19
00:01:53,958 --> 00:01:57,500
So it says in my files,
you're 22 years old.

20
00:01:57,583 --> 00:01:58,875
<i>Da. Da.</i>

21
00:01:58,958 --> 00:02:01,166
- Yeah.
- It's accurate? You're 22 years old?

22
00:02:01,250 --> 00:02:02,375
Yes, I'm 22 years old.

23
00:02:02,458 --> 00:02:04,750
The reason I'm asking…
He's speaking English?

24
00:02:04,833 --> 00:02:07,458
- Yeah.
- You understand my English?

25
00:02:07,541 --> 00:02:10,458
Because you can't be
in the draft if you're over 22,

26
00:02:10,541 --> 00:02:13,375
if you're from overseas.
Do you have a birth certificate?

27
00:02:14,125 --> 00:02:15,208
It was big fire.

28
00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:18,166
[chuckles] Oh. Okay.

29
00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:20,041

- It's my son.

00:02:20,125 --> 00:02:21,583
- It's your son?
- [player] Yes.

31
00:02:23,375 --> 00:02:25,875
- How old is he?
- He's ten years old.

115

116

With us, he'll adapt.

117
00:06:20,416 --> 00:06:22,416

131
00:06:53,208 --> 00:06:56,500
He's physically capable of it.
He just gets bored out there.

132

I've been to Germany four times
in the last two months.

133

bitching at teammates.

136
00:07:05,458 --> 00:07:07,916

No, no, no, I didn't.

153
00:08:08,708 --> 00:08:11,958
I didn't back down. I was just
trying to save everybody some time.

154

I remember when you were at Temple.

155
00:08:14,041 --> 00:08:16,250
I think it was the second game
of the season,

156
00:08:16,333 --> 00:08:17,833
and we were playing Saint Joe,

157
00:08:18,666 --> 00:08:21,916
and some guy took Leon's knees out.

158
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,791
Marlon Daly.
I can't believe you remember that.

159
00:08:24,875 --> 00:08:27,250
I remember you knocking him
into the second row

160
00:08:27,333 --> 00:08:31,333
and then having to be held back
from fighting that entire team.

161
00:08:31,416 --> 00:08:35,250
That's the reason I brought you in,
because you never took anybody's shit.

162
00:08:37,166 --> 00:08:41,583
Rex, you're right.
I should have pushed back more.

163
00:08:41,666 --> 00:08:43,500
I'm sorry, it won't happen again.

164
00:08:44,166 --> 00:08:45,166
No, it won't.

165
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:48,750
Karl, could you pull around
to the back, please?

166
00:08:56,666 --> 00:08:58,458
After I bought the team,

167
00:08:58,541 --> 00:09:00,083
this was before your time,

168
00:09:00,166 --> 00:09:03,041
I gave this office to my Uncle Connie.

169
00:09:03,125 --> 00:09:05,000
He helped out with everything,

170
00:09:05,083 --> 00:09:06,375
worked every day.

171
00:09:08,333 --> 00:09:10,583
Sorry, I didn't make it happen
for you sooner.

172
00:09:11,875 --> 00:09:14,708
I know it's not on the bench,
but it's behind the bench.

173
00:09:17,708 --> 00:09:19,375
So what do you think?

174
00:09:20,375 --> 00:09:23,208
I can't believe you made
your uncle work in this closet.

175
00:09:27,291 --> 00:09:28,291
Thank you.

176
00:09:29,416 --> 00:09:32,458
Feels like I've been waiting
my whole life to become a coach.

177
00:09:33,041 --> 00:09:34,166
Come here.

178
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:35,750
Come.

179
00:09:40,666 --> 00:09:41,833
Never back down.

180
00:09:42,708 --> 00:09:44,291
- Yes, sir.
- All right?

181
00:09:44,375 --> 00:09:46,250
- I won't.
- Yeah. Yeah.

182
00:09:47,458 --> 00:09:48,458
Right.

183
00:09:55,125 --> 00:09:56,541
[woman] Look at the berries.

184
00:09:56,625 --> 00:09:58,791
You need to zoom out
so they can see the whole thing.

185
00:09:59,583 --> 00:10:00,833
Mom, no one uses filters.

186
00:10:00,916 --> 00:10:02,541
I can't eat that whole cake.

187
00:10:02,625 --> 00:10:04,333
Looks like you already did.

188
00:10:04,416 --> 00:10:09,375
Wow, what a lovely welcome home.
I missed you guys too.

189
00:10:09,458 --> 00:10:11,458
Welcome back. Welcome back. Okay.

190
00:10:11,541 --> 00:10:15,125
Not a side hug. What's with the side hug?
When did you stop hugging me?

191
00:10:15,208 --> 00:10:16,833
Honey, you gotta be more gentle.

192
00:10:16,916 --> 00:10:19,625
- Your baby's got titties now.
- That's disgusting.

193
00:10:19,708 --> 00:10:22,291
I don't want to hear about that.
That's between you two.

194
00:10:22,375 --> 00:10:25,458
Dad, can I go to the cemetery tonight?
They're showing <i>Evil Dead.</i>

195
00:10:25,541 --> 00:10:27,875
I told you I love that movie. Absolutely.

196
00:10:27,958 --> 00:10:29,166
No, she can't.

197
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:31,125
No, you can't. Why can't she?

198
00:10:31,208 --> 00:10:33,583
She never finished her presentation
on the Homestead Act.

199
00:10:33,666 --> 00:10:34,708
Didn't finish. Why?

200
00:10:35,416 --> 00:10:36,458
I don't know.

201
00:10:36,541 --> 00:10:38,375
Okay, here's what we'll do.

202
00:10:39,166 --> 00:10:40,958
You can go to the movie tonight.

203
00:10:41,041 --> 00:10:42,041
- Oh, wow.
- Yes.

204
00:10:42,125 --> 00:10:46,250
No. No, no. But all weekend long,
it's just you, your history books.

205
00:10:46,333 --> 00:10:49,041
Sunday night,
I want a TED Talk on the Homestead Act.

206
00:10:49,125 --> 00:10:50,750
- Fine. Yes.
- [Stanley] All right?

207
00:10:50,833 --> 00:10:52,041
- Okay. Cool.
- Thank you.

208
00:10:52,125 --> 00:10:54,125
- I love you. Now can I get a hug?
- Love you too.

209
00:10:54,208 --> 00:10:55,875
- No.
- No? No, hug. [chuckles]

210
00:10:55,958 --> 00:10:57,083
Why would you do that?

211
00:10:57,166 --> 00:10:58,416
Because I was happy

212
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:00,750
she was actually excited
about something for a change.

213
00:11:00,833 --> 00:11:03,916
And to be honest with you,
I… I wanted to be alone with you.

214
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,583
You think you'll get some love
after that bullshit you just pulled?

215
00:11:07,666 --> 00:11:08,583
[scoffs] Hell, no.

216
00:11:08,666 --> 00:11:10,750
- [faucet turns on]
- I have some good news.

217
00:11:10,833 --> 00:11:13,083
You might even like me again
once you hear it.

218
00:11:13,708 --> 00:11:14,708
You are looking at…

219
00:11:14,791 --> 00:11:18,000
Well, you're not looking,
but you're going to look soon,

220
00:11:18,083 --> 00:11:20,916
at the new assistant coach…

221
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,166
[faucet turns off]

222
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:24,666
…for the Philadelphia 76ers.

223
00:11:32,458 --> 00:11:33,625
Thanks for everything.

224
00:11:34,958 --> 00:11:36,083
[kisses]

225
00:11:36,166 --> 00:11:37,166
Oh.

226
00:11:38,666 --> 00:11:42,666
- [sighs] Stanley, Stanley.
- Yep. Yep.

227
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:46,291
- AC! AC!
- We did it. We did it.

228
00:11:46,375 --> 00:11:48,625
- We did it. [laughs]
- "No! Get down there!"

229
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:51,333
- "Get your ass up! Get your ass here!"
- That's right.

230
00:11:51,416 --> 00:11:54,791
- ["The Seed (2.0)" by The Roots playing]
- Yo, check this out.

231
00:11:54,875 --> 00:11:56,375
This video is trending again.

232
00:11:56,458 --> 00:11:59,916
Dr. J still dunking when he was 63.
Isn't that nuts?

233
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,458
Yeah, you should put your phone away,
though, because you're driving.

234
00:12:03,541 --> 00:12:04,583
Yeah, that's true.

235
00:12:04,666 --> 00:12:06,583
But just look at the hops on that guy.

236
00:12:06,666 --> 00:12:08,000
There was nobody like him.

237
00:12:08,083 --> 00:12:09,500
[girl laughs]

238
00:12:10,333 --> 00:12:12,250
- That's cool.
- [Stanley] Mm-hmm.

239
00:12:13,291 --> 00:12:15,541
What's going on with school?
How's that going?

240
00:12:15,625 --> 00:12:17,208
It's, um…

241
00:12:18,291 --> 00:12:19,291
Nothing. It's fine.

242
00:12:19,333 --> 00:12:21,500
In all honesty,
what do we feel about college?

243
00:12:21,583 --> 00:12:23,208
Is that something you want to do?

244
00:12:23,291 --> 00:12:25,375
You talked about going to film school.

245
00:12:26,083 --> 00:12:28,458
So many kids are applying to film schools.

246
00:12:29,708 --> 00:12:31,416
They're not going to pick me.

247
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:35,583
Oh, I'm not worried about all those
other kids. I'm worried about you.

248
00:12:35,666 --> 00:12:37,166
You against you, baby.

249
00:12:37,250 --> 00:12:40,291
You can get it done.
You just gotta do what you love.

250
00:12:40,375 --> 00:12:42,291
Did you love being away
from home all the time?

251
00:12:42,916 --> 00:12:45,208
- That's what you got out of this.
- [laughs]

252
00:12:45,291 --> 00:12:47,875
[Stanley] Of course,
I hated being away from home,

253
00:12:47,958 --> 00:12:51,166
but now that I'm coaching,
I'm going to be around a lot more.

254
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:54,458
So we're going to get your grades up.
Together. Okay.

255
00:12:55,208 --> 00:12:56,583
- Love you. Bye.
- I love you.

256
00:12:56,666 --> 00:12:58,375
Have a good time with these guys.

257
00:12:59,166 --> 00:13:01,750
Hi! I'm so excited! Hi!

258
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:06,875
No side hugs for them.
That's just for me? I love that.

259
00:13:07,541 --> 00:13:10,500
Girls. I know you since kindergarten,
none of you say hi?

260
00:13:10,583 --> 00:13:11,500

00:14:43,875 --> 00:14:45,625
Rex loved you, man.

293
00:14:45,708 --> 00:14:46,708
Thanks, pal.

294
00:14:46,791 --> 00:14:51,708
I just, I can't believe… I just showed
my daughter footage of you jamming,

295
00:14:51,791 --> 00:14:54,583
and it just brought back
so many nice memories.

296
00:14:54,666 --> 00:14:55,916
You can't let 'em forget.

297
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,791
- Right, Stanley?
- No, no.

298
00:14:57,875 --> 00:14:59,791
I'll let you old friends catch up.

299
00:14:59,875 --> 00:15:01,666
- Okay. Stay well.
- Thank you.

300
00:15:02,916 --> 00:15:04,541
- Nice touch with the suit.
- Yeah.

301
00:15:04,625 --> 00:15:06,791
Leon, man, I can't believe this.

302
00:15:06,875 --> 00:15:08,791
Anything you ever need, call me, man.

303
00:15:08,875 --> 00:15:11,500
Yeah. I got to make the rounds.
I appreciate you.

- Love you too, Leon.

Let's talk soon, 22.

306
00:15:18,625 --> 00:15:21,791
Trying to think of something to say to you
besides "I'm sorry."

307
00:15:21,875 --> 00:15:23,291
It doesn't seem enough.

308
00:15:25,291 --> 00:15:27,541
I heard you're moving to the bench.

309
00:15:28,166 --> 00:15:32,208
Uncle Connie's office.
Dad was so excited for you.

310
00:15:32,291 --> 00:15:34,250
"We need a spark, Katherine."

311
00:15:34,333 --> 00:15:35,625
No, man.

312
00:15:35,708 --> 00:15:36,708
Your father,

313
00:15:37,458 --> 00:15:40,625
he mentioned it to me years ago,
but with my past, you know,

314
00:15:41,625 --> 00:15:43,625
I figured he'd rather forget about it.

315
00:15:44,541 --> 00:15:46,333
He'd never forget about you, Sugerman.

You're bailing on us?

No, I'm gonna keep my seat on the board.

- [men] To Rex.

straight like that.

00:16:30,416 --> 00:16:33,500
Dig it in there. Okay?
You decide where you want him to go.

331
00:16:33,583 --> 00:16:34,750
Like Jrue Holiday, bro.

332
00:16:34,833 --> 00:16:37,000
Exactly. Take him out of his comfort zone.

333

[speaks German]

334
00:16:38,333 --> 00:16:41,666
- Huh? I don't understand what that is.
- Did you sleep last night at all?

335
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:43,916
- Do your work early.
- [Stanley] Let's go again.

336
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:44,875
- Ready?
- Okay.

337
00:16:44,958 --> 00:16:48,958
- Come on, Haas. Make him work.
- Don't let him go baseline.

338
00:16:50,625 --> 00:16:51,541
Hey, just focus.

339
00:16:51,625 --> 00:16:53,500
- Go again!
- [man] Make him work.

340
00:16:53,583 --> 00:16:55,833
Hey, Stan. You got a minute?

341
00:16:55,916 --> 00:16:57,458
You want me now?

342
00:16:57,541 --> 00:16:58,916
- Yeah.
- All right.

343
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:10,375
How's he doing?

344
00:17:11,416 --> 00:17:14,875
We're working on it.
He's young. We're going to get him there.

345
00:17:16,666 --> 00:17:19,208
I fucked up. Shouldn't have drafted Haas.

346
00:17:19,291 --> 00:17:21,666
- I wouldn't say that.
- To my face?

347
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:23,583
I would say it to your face.

348
00:17:23,666 --> 00:17:24,750
[chuckles]

349
00:17:24,833 --> 00:17:29,166
My father always appreciated your honesty.
I'm working on it. I really am.

350
00:17:30,416 --> 00:17:31,250
Cool.

351
00:17:31,333 --> 00:17:34,833
I have one job,
to maximize this team's chances

of winning an NBA championship
by any means necessary.

353
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:40,375
Hell with the naysayers. Right?

354
00:17:40,458 --> 00:17:41,708
You're not wrong.

355
00:17:41,791 --> 00:17:43,708
I'm glad to hear you say that.

356
00:17:43,791 --> 00:17:46,625
Got the Hawks' pick next year,
we can't afford to miss.

357
00:17:47,375 --> 00:17:49,583
To be champion requires sacrifice.

358
00:17:49,666 --> 00:17:52,166
Manu coming off the bench.
That's this. That's you.

359
00:17:52,791 --> 00:17:58,541
You're valuable as a coach,
you're indispensable as a scout.

360
00:17:58,625 --> 00:18:02,458
I don't want to be out there anymore.
I never wanted to be out there.

361
00:18:05,791 --> 00:18:06,958
I'm not asking.

362
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:13,541
I haven't been home on my daughter's
birthday for nine years running, Vin.

363

[Vin] Stan.

364
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:22,541
Find me that missing piece,
you're right back on the bench coaching.

["It Never Entered My Mind"

So what you gonna do, Sugerbear?

367
00:18:40,083 --> 00:18:41,083
What can I do?

368
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:43,708
Call Vin right now and say,

"Kiss my fat ass
and fuck your five-star hotels."

370

You don't need this.

371
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:50,708
It's not as simple as that.

372
00:18:52,375 --> 00:18:56,500
How can such a beautiful woman
have such horrifying feet?

- [laughs]
- What is this yellow thing?

374
00:18:59,625 --> 00:19:02,458
It's a callus from exercise.

375
00:19:02,541 --> 00:19:03,916
Remember exercise?

376
00:19:05,791 --> 00:19:08,500

- [Leon] Yeah, you can.

No, that's going to get me in trouble.

Okay.

394
00:19:59,458 --> 00:20:01,583
Why don't you come
and just be an agent with me?

395
00:20:01,666 --> 00:20:04,166
Got an open spot,
I got all the partners on board.

For me?

397
00:20:05,791 --> 00:20:07,000
If I do that, then,

398
00:20:07,916 --> 00:20:10,375
there's no room for growth.
I still want to coach.

399
00:20:10,458 --> 00:20:12,708

there's room to grow there?

400

At least I'm still in the league,
you know.

Talk about Zeke.

403

Talk about Zeke?
He's going one. We're out.

404
00:20:22,125 --> 00:20:25,625
He could trade up,
package Embiid with that King's pick.

- Always, man.

00:28:06,541 --> 00:28:09,666
- Iverson, Barkley...

504
00:28:09,750 --> 00:28:12,416

[player speaks Spanish]

511
00:28:30,625 --> 00:28:33,250
She called me an old man.
Yes, I am an old man.

512
00:28:33,333 --> 00:28:34,833
[family arguing]

513
00:28:34,916 --> 00:28:37,583
Is that your daughter?
I have a daughter. She's older.

514
00:28:37,666 --> 00:28:40,208
She doesn't talk to me anymore.
Hang on. Hang on.

515
00:28:40,291 --> 00:28:41,791
I have an idea. <i>Por favor.</i>

516
00:28:42,375 --> 00:28:45,375
Let me just call…
I don't know what time it is there.

517
00:28:45,458 --> 00:28:47,541
I hope he's there. Please, God, be there.

518
00:28:47,625 --> 00:28:51,333
- [line ringing]
- Please. Please, please pick up. Pick up.

519
00:28:51,916 --> 00:28:52,916
God damn it.

520
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:56,541
<i>- Uh, hello?</i>
- Hey, Schnitzel. I'm in Spain.

521
00:28:56,625 --> 00:28:58,541
I wanted you to meet somebody.

522
00:28:58,625 --> 00:29:00,833
Dirk Nowitzki. See?

523
00:29:01,416 --> 00:29:03,708
How's it going? How's the retirement home?

524
00:29:03,791 --> 00:29:05,375
They still feeding you pudding?

525
00:29:05,458 --> 00:29:07,833
<i>Who is this? How'd you get this number?</i>

526
00:29:07,916 --> 00:29:10,291
[chuckles] Yes.
All right. I deserved that.

527
00:29:10,375 --> 00:29:11,250
<i>I don't know you.</i>

528
00:29:11,333 --> 00:29:13,750
<i>But I've never seen this man
before in my life.</i>

529
00:29:14,458 --> 00:29:17,666
He's starting to believe you, Dirk.
Come on, help me out.

530
00:29:18,208 --> 00:29:22,041
<i>Ah… I'm just kidding,
that's Stan the man right there.</i>

531
00:29:22,125 --> 00:29:23,125
<i>He's a legend.</i>

532
00:29:23,166 --> 00:29:24,958
<i>What's your name, kid?</i>

533
00:29:25,041 --> 00:29:28,083
- Bo, Bo Cruz.
<i>- Where you play at, Bo Cruz?</i>

534
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,125
Nowhere. I just work construction.

535
00:29:31,208 --> 00:29:33,625
<i>Not for long
if Stan is calling me about you.</i>

536
00:29:33,708 --> 00:29:37,250
That's right. You see,
this is <i>mi amigo, amigo.</i>

537
00:29:37,333 --> 00:29:40,625
Thank you so much, Dirk,
and say hi to your grandmother for me.

538
00:29:40,708 --> 00:29:42,041
<i>My grandma died.</i>

539
00:29:42,125 --> 00:29:44,375
That's right. You told me that. My bad.

540
00:29:44,458 --> 00:29:46,833
[woman 2 complaining in Spanish]

541
00:29:46,916 --> 00:29:50,666
[women arguing in Spanish]

542
00:29:54,083 --> 00:29:57,833
["¿Porqué te vas?" by Jeanette
playing on speaker]

543
00:29:57,916 --> 00:30:02,166
[Stanley] There's 450 NBA players,
another 100 just waiting to get called up.

544
00:30:02,250 --> 00:30:05,125
It's my job to know
every other great player in the world.

545
00:30:05,208 --> 00:30:06,458
I'm very good at my job.

546
00:30:07,208 --> 00:30:08,583
I never heard of you.

547
00:30:08,666 --> 00:30:10,875
So tell me your whole story from the top.

548
00:30:11,750 --> 00:30:14,416
- He was a very strong baby.
- Mama, no.

549
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:17,041
Good, I said from the top.
This is nice. Go ahead.

550
00:30:17,125 --> 00:30:19,500
A very sweet boy.

551
00:30:19,583 --> 00:30:21,291
When he was ten years old,

552
00:30:21,375 --> 00:30:24,875
was his gym coach idea to do basketball.

553
00:30:24,958 --> 00:30:28,416
And the club teams,
they want him to play football.

554
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:30,458
The gym coach was smart.

555
00:30:31,083 --> 00:30:32,875
Soccer is awful.

556
00:30:32,958 --> 00:30:36,416
[mother] But with basketball,
he played with the big kids

557
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:38,166
when he was still small.

558
00:30:38,250 --> 00:30:39,791
Biggest hands, though.

559
00:30:39,875 --> 00:30:45,291
They tease him.
The… The movie with the little alien.

560
00:30:45,375 --> 00:30:46,458
Ehm…

561
00:30:47,958 --> 00:30:49,750
Phone home.

562
00:30:49,833 --> 00:30:53,083
<i>- E.T.</i>
- Yes. Very mean boys.

563
00:30:53,625 --> 00:30:54,625
But also,

564
00:30:55,541 --> 00:30:57,166
he kind of looked like an alien.

565
00:30:57,250 --> 00:31:00,958
- [chuckles] I bet.
- He played every day.

566
00:31:01,041 --> 00:31:03,208
After his father, well,

567
00:31:04,875 --> 00:31:07,125
he went away. We don't have him anymore.

568
00:31:07,875 --> 00:31:10,958
I'm sorry. Losing your dad at any age...

569
00:31:11,041 --> 00:31:14,041
Oh, no, he's not lost.
He moved to Portugal with whore.

570
00:31:14,125 --> 00:31:15,708
Mama, <i>la niña.</i>

571
00:31:15,791 --> 00:31:19,458
What? It's true, she knows.
After his father left…

572
00:31:21,083 --> 00:31:22,125
<i>Mi roble.</i>

573
00:31:22,208 --> 00:31:24,416
<i>Roble? Que es "roble"?</i>

574
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:27,500
My strong oak tree.

575
00:31:27,583 --> 00:31:28,500
Uh-huh.

576
00:31:28,583 --> 00:31:31,583
He played basketball all his time,
so he no think of him.

577
00:31:32,875 --> 00:31:36,166
He was invited to a club team
in America when he was 15,

578
00:31:37,083 --> 00:31:39,791
but before he left, Lucia's mother

579
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:41,916
got pregnant.

580
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,875
- So he stayed here for Lucia.
- Right.

581
00:31:48,375 --> 00:31:50,750
I'm gonna make a couple of calls
so I can see you play

582
00:31:50,833 --> 00:31:52,708
with some guys on your level tomorrow.

583
00:31:52,791 --> 00:31:54,166
I got to work.

584
00:31:54,750 --> 00:31:56,000
How old are you?

585
00:31:56,083 --> 00:31:59,083
- Twenty-two.
- Basketball years are like dog years.

586
00:31:59,166 --> 00:32:01,958
We're gonna do this,
we actually got to do this now.

587
00:32:03,041 --> 00:32:06,875
- And how much money will you pay him?
- To come to Philly?

588
00:32:06,958 --> 00:32:09,458
It'll be a prorated league minimum.

589
00:32:09,541 --> 00:32:10,833
But you say he was great.

590
00:32:10,916 --> 00:32:12,958
For great, you pay the maximum, no?

591
00:32:13,041 --> 00:32:18,583
[chuckles] Yeah. Yes, NBA contract
of any kind is maximum, no?

592
00:32:20,375 --> 00:32:25,833
- And how much is the minimum?
- Minimum salary in the NBA is $900,000.

593
00:32:27,041 --> 00:32:28,250
He will call in sick.

594
00:32:28,333 --> 00:32:31,083
All right.
I'll text you the details in the morning.

595
00:32:31,166 --> 00:32:32,833
What a pleasure.

596
00:32:32,916 --> 00:32:35,166
Bo Cruz. Love the name.

[coach] Doing good, Stanley?
You look nervous.

600
00:32:48,166 --> 00:32:51,375
I'm not nervous.
I'm just very excited, Coach.

601
00:32:51,458 --> 00:32:52,833
When is your kid coming in?

602
00:32:53,541 --> 00:32:55,583
Don't know. His bus must be running late.

603
00:32:55,666 --> 00:32:56,791
He doesn't have a car.

604
00:32:59,250 --> 00:33:00,250
Right on time.

605
00:33:00,958 --> 00:33:03,375
Here's my man, the Cruz Missile.

606
00:33:04,750 --> 00:33:05,791
- What?
- What?

607
00:33:05,875 --> 00:33:08,125
You don't like that?
I thought you'd love that.

608
00:33:08,208 --> 00:33:09,750
No? I'll keep thinking.

609
00:33:09,833 --> 00:33:12,541
So I want you to meet Coach Scariolo.

610
00:33:12,625 --> 00:33:14,833
- You know him. Spanish national team.
<i>- ¿Qué tal?</i>

611
00:33:14,916 --> 00:33:16,083
<i>- Hola.</i>
- Bo Cruz.

612
00:33:16,166 --> 00:33:17,375
Felipe. Álex.

613
00:33:17,458 --> 00:33:20,583
These guys are being nice.
They're gonna let you play with 'em.

614
00:33:20,666 --> 00:33:24,916
Willy, José, Pierre. Bo Cruz.

615
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,708
Go on down and get laced up,
stretch out a little bit.

616
00:33:27,791 --> 00:33:29,291
We're going to have some fun.

617
00:33:29,875 --> 00:33:31,458
[in Spanish] You want to try?

618
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:35,166

620
00:33:41,041 --> 00:33:43,541
Willy, you're off the team.

621
00:33:43,625 --> 00:33:45,250
[in English] Yo, get some sneakers on.

622
00:33:45,333 --> 00:33:46,500
Be careful.

623
00:33:50,583 --> 00:33:52,833
- [player] He can jump.
- [Stanley] Yeah, he can jump.

624
00:33:54,375 --> 00:33:58,875
[Stanley on speaker] <i>You believe this?</i>
<i>He hit 44 out of 50 from the side pocket.</i>

625

<i>He's incredible!</i>

626
00:34:00,333 --> 00:34:01,625
You watch the workout?

00:34:01,708 --> 00:34:03,791
[Vin] <i>Of course, I watched.</i>
<i>Kid's impressive.</i>

628
00:34:03,875 --> 00:34:06,083
But there are other considerations.

629
00:34:06,166 --> 00:34:08,791
Character, mentality.
Playing within a system.

630
00:34:08,875 --> 00:34:10,416
I sound like you right now.

631
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:13,291
Vin, this kid is the new Freak.

632
00:34:13,375 --> 00:34:15,750
He's a unicorn, a mythical creature.

633
00:34:15,833 --> 00:34:20,375
The kid hasn't played
organized basketball in eight years.

634
00:34:20,458 --> 00:34:21,958
There's a reason for that.

635
00:34:22,041 --> 00:34:26,541
- Let's see what he can do in the G League.
<i>- You fucking play in the G League, Blake.</i>

636
00:34:26,625 --> 00:34:29,083
All right, listen to me, Vin.

637
00:34:29,166 --> 00:34:30,875
<i>Nobody knows about him.</i>

638
00:34:31,666 --> 00:34:34,791
<i>You're going to see this guy,
you're gonna freak the fuck out.</i>

639
00:34:34,875 --> 00:34:36,958
I promise you, you have to see him live.

640
00:34:38,791 --> 00:34:40,208
It's not gonna happen, Stan.

641
00:34:43,458 --> 00:34:44,875
I'm indispensable.

642
00:34:45,791 --> 00:34:47,208
So valuable, right?

643
00:34:47,291 --> 00:34:50,708
<i>You told me if I wanted to get back
on the bench to find the missing piece.</i>

644
00:34:50,791 --> 00:34:53,625
Well, here I am delivering him
for no money.

645
00:34:53,708 --> 00:34:55,041
And it's not gonna happen?

646
00:34:55,833 --> 00:34:59,166
I pay you to find players,
not tell me what to do with them.

647
00:34:59,750 --> 00:35:00,750
Pay me.

648
00:35:02,916 --> 00:35:04,500
You got something to say, Stan?

649
00:35:13,541 --> 00:35:14,750
[Bo] <i>I don't understand.</i>

650
00:35:14,833 --> 00:35:18,041
[Stanley] <i>It's all good. It's just they</i>
<i>don't have a roster spot at the moment,</i>

651
00:35:18,125 --> 00:35:20,291
<i>but they love what they saw
and want to see more.</i>

652
00:35:20,375 --> 00:35:22,750
And let's just say a spot doesn't open up,

653
00:35:22,833 --> 00:35:24,500
we'll get your name in the draft.

654
00:35:24,583 --> 00:35:28,208
So you play like you did yesterday,
at the combine, you'll be a lock.

655
00:35:28,291 --> 00:35:29,916
They still pay me to come.

656
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,500
They'll pay you for sure.

657
00:35:31,583 --> 00:35:34,625
It might not come at once,
but you'll get the money.

658
00:35:34,708 --> 00:35:36,125
- I promise you.
- Okay.

659
00:35:38,625 --> 00:35:41,666
Giant body like yours
on an eight-hour flight is gonna be rough.

660
00:35:41,750 --> 00:35:43,333
You'll take my seat, okay?

661
00:35:43,416 --> 00:35:45,416
- Oh, really?
- Okay. Yeah, no problem.

662

[whispering] Psst, Stanley. Stanley. Here.

666
00:36:12,416 --> 00:36:13,958
Look what I got.

667
00:36:14,750 --> 00:36:16,708
- [Stanley] Oh, yes.
- They are warm.

668
00:36:17,333 --> 00:36:19,333
- That's good.
- You want some?

669
00:36:19,416 --> 00:36:23,833
Uh… I don't want to start a riot
back here. It's cool, thanks.

670
00:36:23,916 --> 00:36:27,166
- One bite?
- No, I'm trying not to, badly.

671
00:36:27,250 --> 00:36:30,625

- Just give me a fucking roll. Thank you.

[indistinct conversation]

674
00:36:50,666 --> 00:36:52,500
[officer] Sir, I need you to come with me.

675
00:36:53,666 --> 00:36:55,541
Oh, hey, that's my kid.

676
00:36:56,125 --> 00:37:01,000
Yo, excuse me.
No, no, he's with me. He's with me.

677

[man speaking Spanish]

678
00:37:14,750 --> 00:37:16,666
What's up, Oscar? What happened?

679
00:37:16,750 --> 00:37:19,541
He got flagged
for an aggravated assault charge.

680
00:37:20,333 --> 00:37:22,083
Beat up a guy pretty bad five years ago.

681
00:37:22,166 --> 00:37:24,958
- Ah, Jesus.
- He needs to be very careful.

682
00:37:25,041 --> 00:37:27,875
He goes in front of a judge
for even running a stop sign,

683
00:37:27,958 --> 00:37:29,958
he can get his visa permanently revoked.

684
00:37:30,041 --> 00:37:31,666
Right. Okay.

685
00:37:31,750 --> 00:37:33,666
Are you looking at him for the draft?

686
00:37:33,750 --> 00:37:37,875
Yeah. We're all very excited about him.
This is something I should have caught.

687
00:37:37,958 --> 00:37:40,125
I don't want the team
paying for my mistake.

688
00:37:40,208 --> 00:37:43,875
So keep this between us.
I'll cover your hours.

689
00:37:43,958 --> 00:37:46,958
No problem. Just bring us back home
a championship, right?

690
00:37:47,041 --> 00:37:48,458
- Will do, Oscar.
- Good.

691
00:37:48,541 --> 00:37:49,541
Thank you.

692
00:37:50,250 --> 00:37:51,250

Anything else you need to tell me?
Now is the time.

We all have stuff from our past,

695
00:37:56,750 --> 00:38:00,625
but having a criminal record's
a pretty big detail to leave out.

696
00:38:01,625 --> 00:38:05,000
[sighs] No more secrets
from now on, all right?

697
00:38:05,083 --> 00:38:06,333
No big deal, moving on.

[Stanley] Yeah.
He wanted to call his daughter.

710

I gave him money. He's settling in.

You don't get it. The kid is like
if Scottie Pippen and a wolf had a baby.

He has a hairy face.

I'm saying if this kid puts it together,

721
00:39:14,750 --> 00:39:18,125
when he puts it together,
he will be top ten in the league.

one bite of each one.

755

You take one bite and you don't eat
it all, because if not, you get fat.

Right. We played together in college.

766

00:45:34,875 --> 00:45:36,000
This is gonna be good.

839
00:45:37,958 --> 00:45:40,583
He's got a lot of length.
Does he have any control?

840
00:45:44,791 --> 00:45:47,416
- Yeah!
- [Stanley] Nice swat! Way to get after it.

841
00:45:48,333 --> 00:45:49,333
Good D.

842
00:45:55,791 --> 00:45:57,500
[crowd cheers]

843
00:46:01,333 --> 00:46:03,625
Finna hit you with a hazy, cross sidestep.

844
00:46:03,708 --> 00:46:04,708
Think you can stop me?

845
00:46:09,208 --> 00:46:10,291
[crowd exclaims]

846
00:46:11,541 --> 00:46:12,541
Yeah!

847
00:46:13,458 --> 00:46:15,583
Stan's kid getting a lesson here.

848
00:46:15,666 --> 00:46:18,458
You're good. Don't come over here.

849
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,541
- Shit.
- He's like a giraffe on roller skates.

850
00:46:24,500 --> 00:46:26,750
Shake that off. Shake it off.

851
00:46:26,833 --> 00:46:28,333
You get it, right?

852
00:46:29,583 --> 00:46:32,000
Step back three.
Really can't guard me, bro.

853
00:46:38,958 --> 00:46:40,375
[crowd cheers]

854
00:46:40,458 --> 00:46:41,458
Damn, you slow.

855
00:46:43,583 --> 00:46:46,291
- Hey, let's take a seat for a minute.
- No.

856
00:46:46,875 --> 00:46:48,375
Just give yourself a breather.

857
00:46:48,458 --> 00:46:50,666
[Kermit] Listen to him.
Listen to your daddy.

858
00:46:53,958 --> 00:46:55,000
Here comes a brick.

859
00:46:56,166 --> 00:46:57,291
Oh, yeah!

860
00:46:57,375 --> 00:46:59,416
You can see it's getting to his head.

861
00:46:59,500 --> 00:47:01,708
[unnerving music playing]

862
00:47:04,916 --> 00:47:07,833
- Oh! It's okay.
- I think the game's too fast for him.

863
00:47:11,083 --> 00:47:12,083
Nothing.

864
00:47:14,500 --> 00:47:15,500
[both laugh]

865
00:47:15,541 --> 00:47:16,583
Move out the way.

866
00:47:16,666 --> 00:47:17,958
All right, kid.

867
00:47:18,041 --> 00:47:20,833
- [laughter]
- [unnerving music continues]

868
00:47:28,541 --> 00:47:30,625
[crowd cheering]

869
00:47:31,958 --> 00:47:33,458
<i>Olé,</i> bitch!

870
00:47:38,708 --> 00:47:39,958
Shit.

871
00:47:41,125 --> 00:47:42,541
He had his moments. I saw it.

872
00:47:42,625 --> 00:47:44,958
That wasn't him.
That wasn't even close to him.

873
00:47:45,458 --> 00:47:48,166
[sighs] It's my fault.
I rushed this whole thing.

874
00:47:48,250 --> 00:47:51,000
Remember our freshman year,
we were playing at Gonzaga,

875
00:47:51,083 --> 00:47:52,750
they put John Stockton on me?

876
00:47:52,833 --> 00:47:55,416
You said watch out for this guy.
I said nobody looking like

877
00:47:55,500 --> 00:47:57,333
an insurance salesman
going to bust my ass.

878
00:47:57,416 --> 00:48:00,458
Midway through the second half,
20 points, 20 assists.

879
00:48:00,541 --> 00:48:03,291
- None of y'all would look at me. Remember?
- I remember.

880
00:48:03,375 --> 00:48:05,208
Remember me playing like that again?

881
00:48:05,291 --> 00:48:07,875
No, 'cause I never wanted
to feel that feeling again.

882
00:48:08,416 --> 00:48:10,041
So tonight's a good thing.

883
00:48:10,125 --> 00:48:12,166
Nothing was good about tonight.

884
00:48:12,250 --> 00:48:14,083
That was some awful… [laughing]

885
00:48:14,166 --> 00:48:16,708
- Wanna grab some din-din?
- I got to catch a plane.

886
00:48:17,416 --> 00:48:21,041
You're gonna have to pick up the tab
on the Spanish kid. I'm not interested.

887
00:48:22,208 --> 00:48:24,208
Time to get back out there
and keep looking.

888
00:48:24,708 --> 00:48:27,375
You're gonna miss
another one of your daughter's birthdays.

889
00:48:27,458 --> 00:48:29,583
The Sixers will send
something nice for her.

890
00:48:33,166 --> 00:48:37,500
Hey, I never asked you
to pick up the tab on him, Vincent.

891
00:48:38,125 --> 00:48:39,666
Frankly, I'm not interested

892
00:48:39,750 --> 00:48:43,083
in working for a smug,
born-on-third fucking bitch.

893
00:48:43,833 --> 00:48:45,208
So how's this?

894
00:48:45,958 --> 00:48:50,041
Kiss my fat ass,
and fuck your five-star hotels.

895
00:48:50,125 --> 00:48:51,500
I quit.

896
00:48:59,500 --> 00:49:00,916
So Stanley's not coming to dinner?

897
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:02,875
- I really wish he was now.
- [laughter]

898
00:49:02,958 --> 00:49:05,208
[Blake] Stanley knows
how to fuck up his life.

899
00:49:05,291 --> 00:49:07,083
Another bad decision in the books.

900
00:49:16,583 --> 00:49:18,208
The combine's in six weeks.

901
00:49:21,708 --> 00:49:22,958
Can you get my guy in?

902
00:49:24,916 --> 00:49:25,916
I'll work on it.

903
00:49:26,708 --> 00:49:28,916
Don't have a heart attack, man.
Come on, 22.

904
00:49:38,875 --> 00:49:39,916
I fly home tomorrow.

905
00:49:40,958 --> 00:49:42,375
Is that what you want to do?

906
00:49:43,916 --> 00:49:45,041
You come all this way,

907
00:49:45,125 --> 00:49:47,500
have one bad day,
and you're ready to back down?

908
00:49:48,125 --> 00:49:50,583
- No, but I suck.
- Do you love this game?

909
00:49:52,166 --> 00:49:53,833
Love it with your whole heart?

910
00:49:55,291 --> 00:49:58,500
Because if you don't,
let's not even bother.

911
00:50:00,125 --> 00:50:03,750
Let's not open that door.
They're gonna slam it right in our face.

912
00:50:03,833 --> 00:50:06,833
I love this game. I live this game.

913
00:50:08,583 --> 00:50:12,791
And there's 1,000 other guys waiting in
the wings who are obsessed with this game.

914
00:50:15,416 --> 00:50:17,708
Obsession is gonna beat talent every time.

915
00:50:18,666 --> 00:50:21,875
You've got all the talent in the world,
but are you obsessed?

916
00:50:22,500 --> 00:50:24,583
Is it all you ever think about?

917
00:50:24,666 --> 00:50:26,916
Let's face it,
it's you against you out there.

918
00:50:28,083 --> 00:50:33,125
When you walk on that court, you have
to think, "I am the best guy out there."

919
00:50:33,208 --> 00:50:34,958
"I don't care if LeBron's playing."

920
00:50:36,416 --> 00:50:39,625
So let me ask you again.
Do you love this game?

921
00:50:41,833 --> 00:50:42,833
Yes.

922
00:50:43,375 --> 00:50:45,666
Is there a newborn kitten
purring in here right now?

923
00:50:45,750 --> 00:50:46,791
I couldn't hear you.

924
00:50:48,041 --> 00:50:51,291
- [shouts] Do you want to be in the NBA?
- Yes!

925
00:50:52,666 --> 00:50:53,875
Let's make that happen.

926
00:50:56,041 --> 00:50:57,375
Never back down.

927
00:50:59,833 --> 00:51:01,958
[soft music playing]

928
00:51:02,041 --> 00:51:03,666
[phone vibrating]

929
00:51:11,375 --> 00:51:12,416
Hello.

930
00:51:12,500 --> 00:51:15,791
[Stanley] Buenos días, <i>Bo Cruz.</i>
<i>I'm out front.</i>

931
00:51:18,291 --> 00:51:20,041
Stanley, it's 4:10, man.

932
00:51:20,125 --> 00:51:22,375
[Stanley] Come on downstairs.
Bring your shit.

933
00:51:25,458 --> 00:51:28,916
Kobe used to get up at 4:00 a.m.
so he could practice before practice.

934
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:30,333
I got you a gift.

935
00:51:33,333 --> 00:51:34,750
[Bo chuckles]

936
00:51:34,833 --> 00:51:37,250
- Kobes.
- That's right, for inspiration.

937
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:40,041
- Let's get to work.
- [engine starts]

938
00:51:40,125 --> 00:51:42,041
The combine's in a month and a half.

939
00:51:42,125 --> 00:51:45,208
It's a televised game, so the whole
world's gonna get to see you play.

940
00:51:45,291 --> 00:51:46,500
We got to get you ready.

941
00:51:46,583 --> 00:51:47,583
[groans softly]

942
00:51:48,458 --> 00:51:49,666
So you see this hill?

943
00:51:50,500 --> 00:51:53,875
Average professional biker can get
to the top of this hill in two minutes.

944
00:51:53,958 --> 00:51:58,125
We're gonna come out here every morning
till you get the top, running, minute-45.

945
00:51:58,916 --> 00:52:00,375
- Shit.
- Yeah.

946
00:52:00,958 --> 00:52:03,541
And three, two, one.

947
00:52:03,625 --> 00:52:05,958
- [car horn beeps]
- Let's go. Move it, kid. Yup.

948
00:52:06,041 --> 00:52:07,375
Looking good.

949
00:52:07,458 --> 00:52:10,833
That's it, man. That's it. I like it.

950
00:52:10,916 --> 00:52:11,916
Go, go, go!

951
00:52:12,833 --> 00:52:14,208
Pump it.

952
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:16,166
Pump those arms.

953
00:52:16,250 --> 00:52:18,583
[inspirational music playing]

954
00:52:20,708 --> 00:52:24,166
Whoa, whoa, whoa. What are you doing?
Don't stop. To the top.

955
00:52:27,333 --> 00:52:31,166
Oh, we're going to be here
a lot, bud. Let's go!

956
00:52:35,458 --> 00:52:38,291
Keep going, come on. Find it in you.

957
00:52:39,125 --> 00:52:43,041
You got to push it, bro.
I'm telling you, I'm gonna hit your heels.

958
00:52:43,666 --> 00:52:46,416
Oh, my goodness gracious.

959
00:52:47,291 --> 00:52:50,875
- [coughing]
- Okay. All right, so that's time.

960
00:52:50,958 --> 00:52:53,500
I had no idea
this stopwatch went that high.

961
00:52:54,916 --> 00:52:56,000
I'm not shitting you.

962
00:52:56,083 --> 00:53:00,041
When we were teaching my daughter to walk,
she got up this hill faster than you.

963
00:53:03,250 --> 00:53:04,458
Just get in the car.

964
00:53:05,250 --> 00:53:07,500
Whew. We've got a lot of work to do, baby.

965
00:53:08,750 --> 00:53:10,666
Ah, you're getting sweat in my Malibu.

966
00:53:10,750 --> 00:53:12,750
- [Bo sighs tiredly]
- [laughs] Oh, all right.

967
00:53:17,833 --> 00:53:19,125
Bo.

968
00:53:19,208 --> 00:53:21,333
Hi. This is my daughter, Alex.

969
00:53:21,416 --> 00:53:23,083
- This is Bo.
- Nice to meet you.

970
00:53:23,958 --> 00:53:26,291
- Hi.
- She's going to be shooting us today.

971
00:53:26,375 --> 00:53:27,958
Are you ready, kid?

972
00:53:28,041 --> 00:53:29,708
- Alex.
- Yes.

973
00:53:29,791 --> 00:53:32,375
All right. All right.
I've never seen her like that.

974
00:53:32,458 --> 00:53:33,458
That was funny.

975
00:53:33,500 --> 00:53:34,916
All right.

976
00:53:35,583 --> 00:53:38,000
Get this.
Alex, get this round. Initiate contact.

977
00:53:38,083 --> 00:53:39,833
Don't get jammed. Get past that.

978
00:53:39,916 --> 00:53:42,750
Drive. Use your legs. Downhill.
Down. Finish...

979
00:53:42,833 --> 00:53:44,666
- [grunting]
- Come on. All right.

980
00:53:44,750 --> 00:53:46,958
Your first year in the league, no calls.

981
00:53:47,041 --> 00:53:48,166
You need a hand up?

982
00:53:48,250 --> 00:53:50,208
Get out of here. Don't look so sad.

983
00:53:50,291 --> 00:53:53,250
Go ahead. Zoom in
on that sad face of his right now.

984
00:53:53,333 --> 00:53:55,250
I want you to finish through it. Let's go.

985
00:53:55,333 --> 00:53:57,458
All right,
shoulders down, that's right. Go!

986
00:53:58,625 --> 00:53:59,541
Okay. All right.

987
00:53:59,625 --> 00:54:02,958
You absorbed the contact. I need you
to finish through the contact.

988
00:54:03,041 --> 00:54:06,541
Alex, you get that?
Okay, we're getting there. Go, go, go!

989
00:54:06,625 --> 00:54:10,000
Cut. Move. Go downhill!
All the way, now finish it.

990
00:54:10,083 --> 00:54:12,708
Oh! That's how you take it to the rim.

991
00:54:12,791 --> 00:54:16,541
What happened? Were you on me?
Always on the money, sweetheart.

992
00:54:16,625 --> 00:54:17,625
Good God.

993
00:54:18,708 --> 00:54:20,708
- He is mad because he's hungry.
- [laughs]

994
00:54:20,791 --> 00:54:23,416
What'd he say?
Because I'm what? He made a fat joke?

995
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:26,166
[chuckles, sighs]

996
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:29,000
- [man] He's special.
- [Stanley] Special, right?

997
00:54:34,166 --> 00:54:36,458
- What's that baby chick about?
- Um…

998
00:54:36,541 --> 00:54:38,458
That's for my daughter, Lucia.

999
00:54:38,541 --> 00:54:40,833
We call her <i>Pollito.</i>
It means little chicken.

1000
00:54:40,916 --> 00:54:43,208
So all these are for my mom
and my daughter.

1001
00:54:43,291 --> 00:54:44,666
They mean everything to me.

1002
00:54:45,333 --> 00:54:47,875
- What about your dad?
- All these are for him.

1003
00:54:52,541 --> 00:54:53,701
[Stanley] <i>Don't think, react!</i>

1004
00:54:53,750 --> 00:54:56,291
- She did it.
- [Bo] She's good with camera.

1005
00:54:56,375 --> 00:54:59,291
She's good. She didn't have to put
her name on your… But that's fine.

1006
00:54:59,375 --> 00:55:01,291
<i>Okay. This ain't Europe, baby.</i>

1007
00:55:01,375 --> 00:55:04,166
<i>It gets quick here. Offense takes skill.</i>

1008
00:55:04,250 --> 00:55:07,125
<i>Defense takes balls, baby. That's right.</i>

1009
00:55:07,208 --> 00:55:09,000

So, how do you think you did?

1014
00:55:18,208 --> 00:55:21,458
They scored a couple times,
but I think I did pretty good.

1015
00:55:21,541 --> 00:55:24,541
Three guys were running at you full tilt
for five minutes straight,

1016
00:55:24,625 --> 00:55:26,125
and they scored a couple times.

1017
00:55:26,208 --> 00:55:27,708
- You crushed it.
- [chuckles]

1018
00:55:27,791 --> 00:55:30,791
The only thing in your way
is that big brain of yours.

1019
00:55:30,875 --> 00:55:33,375
You're sensitive.
I get that. I'm sensitive too.

1020
00:55:33,458 --> 00:55:36,541
I cried at the end of <i>Titanic,</i>
but I'm not in the NBA.

1021
00:55:36,625 --> 00:55:39,083
You? You can never be soft again.

1022
00:55:39,166 --> 00:55:40,750
- I'm not soft.
- Please.

1023
00:55:40,833 --> 00:55:44,666
Kermit, a guy named after a frog,
said some mean words to you,

1024
00:55:44,750 --> 00:55:47,125
and you wanted
to take your ball and run home.

1025
00:55:47,208 --> 00:55:49,583
It was a trick.
It's never gonna happen again.

1026
00:55:49,666 --> 00:55:51,458
- Nothing he said bothered you?
- No.

1027
00:55:51,541 --> 00:55:53,666
- Kermit?
- Okay, my bad.

1028
00:55:53,750 --> 00:55:55,458
<i>I'm</i> over thinking it, I guess.

1029

00:56:14,583 --> 00:56:16,500
- What?
- What was that?

1035
00:56:16,583 --> 00:56:19,500
- Just said some words. That's it. Hey.
- It's not cool, man.

1036

1042

When I played college ball,
every time I took a shot,

1043
00:56:39,958 --> 00:56:43,583
somebody tried to insult me.
They called me short or slow or chubby.

1044
00:56:43,666 --> 00:56:45,750
- You know what I did?
- What'd you do?

1045
00:56:45,833 --> 00:56:48,458
I started passing
'cause I couldn't shoot for shit.

1046
00:56:48,541 --> 00:56:50,333
But you don't want my career.

Two hundred dollars' worth of Pringles?
These are meals for the week.

1067
00:57:43,791 --> 00:57:46,333
Tell him to rinse the containers,
so I can reuse them.

1068
00:57:46,416 --> 00:57:49,750
And also, tell him
pornography is free on the Internet.

1069
00:57:49,833 --> 00:57:52,166
He's paying for porno?

1070

- And who is Paula Serrano?
- [grunts]

1071
00:57:56,208 --> 00:58:00,708
- You've been wiring her $500 a week.
- "Paola." Paola's Bo's mother.

He's got a daughter to support.

- Right.

1074
00:58:08,875 --> 00:58:11,708
Just tell him
to pump the brakes on the Pringles.

At least until the Sixers
start picking up the tab.

- Well, I'm not.

My wife made them, so they're healthy.
You can eat the whole thing.

- No. It's all good.

They also mentioned
they'd love you to stop with the porno.

- Hey.

What do you think
of the Cruz Missile as a nickname for...

1275
01:07:47,291 --> 01:07:48,875
- The Cruz...
- He doesn't like it.

1276
01:07:48,958 --> 01:07:50,250
That nickname is stupid.

1277
01:07:50,333 --> 01:07:52,625
- He says it's stupid.

[Teresa] Don't be rude.

- I miss her so much.

Yeah. She does. They're beautiful.

01:08:05,833 --> 01:08:07,500
- [all chuckle]
- No.

1285
01:08:07,583 --> 01:08:10,000
So, have you ever been
away from her this long?

1286
01:08:10,666 --> 01:08:14,458
- I've never been away from her.
- Never? Oh, my goodness.

1287
01:08:15,833 --> 01:08:19,333
So, anyway, Mrs. Sugerman,
tell me how you met this guy.

1288
01:08:19,416 --> 01:08:23,666
- "How'd she become so lucky?" He's asking.
- Okay. All right. Story time.

1289
01:08:23,750 --> 01:08:29,583
So, I was on the women's track team,
and we had a meet at Virginia Tech,

1290
01:08:29,666 --> 01:08:34,625
and it was the same time
that the men's basketball team had a game.

1291
01:08:34,708 --> 01:08:37,833
And, unfortunately for us,
our bus broke down. So…

1292
01:08:37,916 --> 01:08:39,458
Mm-hmm. I paid the bus driver.

1293
01:08:39,541 --> 01:08:44,041
We had to bum a ride home
with those fools.

1294
01:08:44,125 --> 01:08:48,708
Stanley sat next to me
for three hours, the entire ride home,

1295
01:08:48,791 --> 01:08:50,666
and he didn't say one word.

1296
01:08:50,750 --> 01:08:53,708
I didn't think
she wanted to talk to me. I was scared.

1297
01:08:53,791 --> 01:08:56,000
And then, as everybody is walking off,

1298
01:08:56,083 --> 01:08:59,916
he just says crazy loud,
"One day, I'm gonna marry you,

1299
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:02,375
and we're gonna have
very athletic children!"

1300
01:09:02,458 --> 01:09:04,875
- I'm like, "What?"
- You really say that?

1301
01:09:04,958 --> 01:09:08,625
I did. Yeah, it worked. Right?
Look, I do. We both have a…

1302
01:09:08,708 --> 01:09:11,416
- Well, not athletic at all...
- Hey! What the heck?

1303
01:09:11,500 --> 01:09:13,750
- Not even badminton. Not Frisbee.
- [Alex] Okay.

1304
01:09:13,833 --> 01:09:15,416
Playing checkers, she falls down.

1305
01:09:15,500 --> 01:09:17,500
- I'm just saying.
- [Teresa] Oh, my God.

1306
01:09:17,583 --> 01:09:20,833
- [Alex] Oh, my God!
- That was when you played at Temple?

1307
01:09:20,916 --> 01:09:23,291
I played at Temple. Yeah.
How'd you know that?

1308
01:09:23,375 --> 01:09:25,625
Come on, Stanley.
You follow me to my home,

1309
01:09:25,708 --> 01:09:27,291
offer me, like, crazy money,

1310
01:09:27,375 --> 01:09:29,583

I'll look you up on Internet?

Uh-huh!

1313
01:09:33,416 --> 01:09:36,083
Somebody did his homework,
unlike somebody else.

1314
01:09:36,166 --> 01:09:39,875
Well, Stan can ball.
You do know he can handle the rock.

1315
01:09:39,958 --> 01:09:41,500
- Stanley?
- If he didn't get hurt,

1316
01:09:41,583 --> 01:09:43,791
- it'd have been a different story.
- Who wants coffee?

1317
01:09:43,875 --> 01:09:46,541
- You want coffee? I'll get coffee.
- Spanish coffee, please.

1318
01:09:46,625 --> 01:09:50,166
[Stanley] Okay. I'm gonna go to Spain.
I'll be right back, guys.

- Thanks for having me.</i>

the Sixers brought in Bo Cruz,</i>

1331
01:10:30,958 --> 01:10:33,666
<i>who has a history of assault,
to play in the combine?</i>

1332

[Vin] <i>No. Bo Cruz has no affiliation</i>

1333
01:10:37,416 --> 01:10:41,208
<i>He was brought over here by
a disgruntled employee, Stanley Sugerman.</i>

1334
01:10:41,291 --> 01:10:44,916
<i>I specifically told Mr. Sugerman
not to bring him over.</i>

1335

1336
01:10:47,875 --> 01:10:50,916
<i>Mr. Sugerman's selfish behavior
has been part of his track record.</i>

1337

Hey, Bo. Just get in the car, man.
Let me talk to you.

1341
01:11:17,333 --> 01:11:20,416
What are you gonna do?
Walk to Spain? Just please, let me...

1342
01:11:20,500 --> 01:11:22,375
- You fucking lied to me!
- I know.

1343
01:11:22,458 --> 01:11:24,416
- You lied to me.
- All right. He's all right.

1344
01:11:24,500 --> 01:11:27,583
I quit my job for you!
You said "trust," and I fucking trust you.

1345
01:11:27,666 --> 01:11:29,291
- I'm sorry.
- You gambled with my life!

1346
01:11:29,375 --> 01:11:32,000
- It wasn't a gamble. It was a sure thing.
- It's fucking over.

1347
01:11:32,083 --> 01:11:34,458
You and me is fucking over!
You hear me? Over!

1348
01:11:34,541 --> 01:11:37,375
- Hey. No. Just stop. Right now. Please.
- [police siren whooping]

1349
01:11:37,458 --> 01:11:38,833
Don't throw it all away.

1350
01:11:38,916 --> 01:11:42,375
I'm begging you, just let go of me.
Get in the car. It's not worth it.

1351
01:11:42,458 --> 01:11:44,875
I'm not worth it. Just stop. Okay.

1352
01:11:45,666 --> 01:11:47,000
All right. Get in the car.

1353
01:11:47,083 --> 01:11:50,250
- [officer] Everything okay here?
- Hey, guys. Yeah. Everything's good.

1354
01:12:08,125 --> 01:12:09,500
When Lucia was two…

1355
01:12:13,250 --> 01:12:15,333
Her mom, Maria, asked me for her.

1356
01:12:16,583 --> 01:12:18,583
She didn't wanna share custody anymore.

1357
01:12:24,208 --> 01:12:25,333
I asked her, "Why?"

1358
01:12:26,833 --> 01:12:28,500
She told me it was her boyfriend.

1359
01:12:30,708 --> 01:12:35,083
He told her they can get money
from the government if she got Lucia.

1360
01:12:37,916 --> 01:12:38,916
So…

1361
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:42,291
I went to his home.

1362
01:12:44,250 --> 01:12:45,958
I swear, I just wanna talk to him.

1363
01:12:47,583 --> 01:12:49,000
I know I make a mistake.

1364
01:12:50,750 --> 01:12:52,916
But I'm not how they say I am.

1365
01:12:56,791 --> 01:12:57,791
I get it.

1366
01:12:59,125 --> 01:13:00,791
You don't get shit, man.

1367
01:13:02,833 --> 01:13:06,416
You live in your perfect world,
with your perfect family.

1368
01:13:06,500 --> 01:13:07,500
[Stanley] Mm.

1369
01:13:20,833 --> 01:13:24,791
One night, after a game at Villanova,
we went to a party.

1370
01:13:25,750 --> 01:13:27,375
Me and Leon.

1371
01:13:30,708 --> 01:13:32,250
And on the way home, I…

1372
01:13:33,208 --> 01:13:35,125
I had a few drinks in me.

1373
01:13:36,541 --> 01:13:38,833
I looked down at the radio.

1374
01:13:39,916 --> 01:13:42,708
When I looked back up,
I saw a telephone pole.

1375
01:13:45,208 --> 01:13:46,875
I shot my hand out

1376
01:13:48,125 --> 01:13:50,750
to stop Leon
from flying through the windshield.

1377
01:13:51,416 --> 01:13:55,083
He still got banged up a little bit,
but my hand was pulp.

1378
01:13:58,208 --> 01:14:03,916
I cost Leon and all my teammates
a shot at the NCAA title that year.

1379
01:14:07,875 --> 01:14:09,750
I got to think about that.

1380
01:14:09,833 --> 01:14:12,291
I mean, really, really marinate in it

1381
01:14:13,375 --> 01:14:15,166

1382
01:14:20,291 --> 01:14:22,666

1383
01:14:26,041 --> 01:14:27,041

1384
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:30,458
Everything I wanted.

1385
01:14:32,041 --> 01:14:33,083
Gone.

1386
01:14:52,291 --> 01:14:54,416
[Stanley]
Half the fucking list are favors!

1387
01:14:54,500 --> 01:14:57,083
I'm not asking for a favor.
This guy can play!

1388
01:14:57,958 --> 01:14:59,833
Everybody keeps saying that. That...

1389
01:14:59,916 --> 01:15:02,083
But you don't know the whole story.

1390
01:15:02,166 --> 01:15:04,000
He's... Meet the kid!

1391
01:15:05,166 --> 01:15:09,083
Just set it up! I'll bring him anywhere!
Anywhere! He'll play anyone!

1392
01:15:09,166 --> 01:15:11,166
Will you... Yes. Ryan!

1393
01:15:11,791 --> 01:15:13,541
Yes, I know. I know.

1394
01:15:13,625 --> 01:15:16,208
And you almost
didn't let Damian Lillard play!

1395
01:15:17,250 --> 01:15:19,916
Right! So, you do make mistakes!

1396
01:15:20,500 --> 01:15:24,208
Don't make a mistake on this kid.
I'm begging you, pal. For…

1397
01:15:24,291 --> 01:15:26,500
For your sake, not just mine!

1398
01:15:26,583 --> 01:15:32,416
God damn it. I spoke
at your father's camp every year!

1399
01:15:32,500 --> 01:15:35,791
And I never asked for anything back! Okay?

1400
01:15:35,875 --> 01:15:39,166
So I'm asking you now for something!
Please help me!

1401

Stanley, it's not about the last play.

1408
01:16:08,333 --> 01:16:10,000
It's about the next one, right?

1409

give yourself a heart attack.

- People just need to see him play, right?
- Certain people. Yeah.

1420
01:17:02,291 --> 01:17:05,375

of your doctor friend?

1421

- [Teresa chuckles]

from the hospital?

[Teresa] That's Dr. J.
He's not a real doctor.

1424

Oh. Well, whatever.

1425

- I can't ask him to do that.

01:17:20,208 --> 01:17:21,125
Well, I can.

1428

help us out with something.

- Yeah, that's Dr. J.

Yo. That's my friend Bo Cruz over there.
They call him the Boa.

1437
01:17:52,750 --> 01:17:54,750
You know why they call him that?

1438
01:17:54,833 --> 01:17:57,416
Because he squeezes the life
out of his prey.

1439
01:17:58,208 --> 01:17:59,666
[Stanley] So, guys, here's the deal.

1440

He's gonna go out on the court.

If you put a bucket in against this guy,
we'll give you 100 bucks.

If you beat him in a game
of one-on-one to five,

1445

we'll give you 1,000 bucks.

- I tell you what.

1489
01:22:00,916 --> 01:22:03,166
He could be playing
for the Sixers right now,

1490
01:22:03,250 --> 01:22:07,041
but Vince Merrick didn't want him.
He specifically said that. You remember?

1491
01:22:07,125 --> 01:22:09,333
Anthony, you remember that, right?

1492
01:22:09,416 --> 01:22:11,333
- You were interviewing him.
- That's right.

1493
01:22:11,416 --> 01:22:13,500
He's 22. You're messing with his life.

1494
01:22:13,583 --> 01:22:15,375
- What kind of ballplayer...
- Hang on.

1495
01:22:15,458 --> 01:22:18,541
Have some respect for your profession.
Get the whole story next time.

1496
01:22:18,625 --> 01:22:21,333
What kind of ballplayer...
I'll answer that question.

1497
01:22:21,416 --> 01:22:25,500
This guy is as if Scottie Pippen
and a wolf had a baby,

1498
01:22:25,583 --> 01:22:27,625
and Lisa Leslie raised him.

1499
01:22:27,708 --> 01:22:29,791
And Allen Iverson was the babysitter.

1500
01:22:29,875 --> 01:22:30,875
[laughter]

1501
01:22:30,958 --> 01:22:33,708
It gets weird, that stuff.
But you handled it great.

1502
01:22:35,416 --> 01:22:37,583
What else is bothering you? Tell me.

1503
01:22:38,875 --> 01:22:41,000
Nothing. See you tomorrow.

1504
01:22:41,708 --> 01:22:42,791
Yeah.

1505
01:22:50,083 --> 01:22:52,583
[Teresa] <i>So, he got into the combine,</i>
<i>and he's not excited?</i>

1506
01:22:52,666 --> 01:22:55,791
He's in his own head.
He's not telling me anything.

1507
01:22:56,666 --> 01:22:59,041
- [sighs]
- Well, maybe he's just sad.

1508
01:23:00,125 --> 01:23:04,166
Eh. I think he's overwhelmed.
The pressure's getting to him.

1509
01:23:04,250 --> 01:23:08,000
Mm-mm. I bet it's the kid. Lucia.

1510
01:23:08,916 --> 01:23:10,916
I mean, he's never been away from her.

1511
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:12,291
Like ever.

1512
01:23:36,208 --> 01:23:37,833
[indistinct chatter]

1513
01:23:42,666 --> 01:23:44,166
[Stanley] Okay, here we go.

1514
01:23:49,375 --> 01:23:50,291
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1515
01:23:50,375 --> 01:23:53,208
Superstars don't carry
their own bags. I got this.

1516
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:56,333
[sentimental music playing]

1517
01:24:04,875 --> 01:24:07,708
I'll meet you in the lobby
in one hour, okay?

1518
01:24:09,208 --> 01:24:10,916
This is very, very good.

1519
01:24:12,250 --> 01:24:13,666
[indistinct chatter]

1520
01:24:14,875 --> 01:24:17,708
Ray Hancock can't stop
working his ass off.

1521
01:24:17,791 --> 01:24:20,000
Come on. Come on. Come with me.

1522
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:22,000
Hey.

1523
01:24:22,916 --> 01:24:24,458
When you train for a marathon,

1524
01:24:24,541 --> 01:24:27,333
you don't run 20 miles
the day before the race.

1525
01:24:27,416 --> 01:24:28,416
You do nothing.

1526
01:24:28,958 --> 01:24:32,500
All we could do now
is get you hurt or wear you out.

1527
01:24:32,583 --> 01:24:34,000
So we're gonna do this.

1528
01:24:35,833 --> 01:24:37,541
- [Bo] Lucia!
<i>- Papi!</i>

1529
01:24:37,625 --> 01:24:38,875
[Paola laughs]

1530
01:24:40,125 --> 01:24:41,125
[Bo] <i>¡Hola!</i>

1531
01:24:54,666 --> 01:24:56,791
[Stanley] Boa challenge is still trending.

1532
01:24:56,875 --> 01:24:59,625
People are excited to see
what you're gonna do tomorrow.

1533
01:24:59,708 --> 01:25:01,583
Look at this. Look at this.

1534
01:25:01,666 --> 01:25:05,291
You think I know that many people?
This is all for you, pal.

1535
01:25:05,375 --> 01:25:07,750
- That's for us.
- Okay, it's for us. Let's get 'em.

1536
01:25:08,666 --> 01:25:12,750
Tomorrow, they're gonna be watching you.
Every move you make, the camera's on you.

1537
01:25:12,833 --> 01:25:15,958
And it's not just about how you play.
It's the intangibles.

1538
01:25:16,041 --> 01:25:19,416
More important than making a shot
is how you handle missing a shot.

1539
01:25:19,500 --> 01:25:21,666
Shit's gonna go wrong. So what?

1540
01:25:21,750 --> 01:25:24,208
You've dealt with adversity
your whole goddamn life.

1541
01:25:24,291 --> 01:25:26,041
- Yeah.
- [Stanley] It's Bo's turn.

1542
01:25:27,083 --> 01:25:28,458
You're nervous, huh?

1543
01:25:29,250 --> 01:25:30,375
It's all right.

1544
01:25:30,458 --> 01:25:33,416
Hey. Clyde Drexler used to get
so nervous before games

1545
01:25:33,500 --> 01:25:34,750
that he'd actually faint.

1546
01:25:34,833 --> 01:25:36,958
I'm not kidding you.
The guy did it so much

1547
01:25:37,041 --> 01:25:39,916
his teammates followed him around
so they could catch him.

1548
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:41,500
It became kind of a ritual.

1549
01:25:42,125 --> 01:25:44,625
It's good to be nervous.
It means you give a shit.

1550
01:25:44,708 --> 01:25:45,833
- All right?
- All right.

1551
01:25:46,583 --> 01:25:49,041
- Mama, you'll get him to sleep?
- Okay.

1552
01:25:49,125 --> 01:25:51,625
Okay. Lucia, go easy on the Pringles.

1553
01:25:51,708 --> 01:25:53,666
- All right. <i>Adiós.</i>
- [Paola laughs]

1554
01:25:53,750 --> 01:25:55,333
- [Paola] <i>Adiós.</i>
- Bo Cruz.

1555
01:25:56,541 --> 01:25:59,625
You're gonna Cruz-ify them tomorrow. Huh?

1556
01:25:59,708 --> 01:26:01,625
- It's still not funny. Get out.
- It's no good?

1557
01:26:01,708 --> 01:26:03,333
- Good night, my man.
- Good night.

1558
01:26:03,416 --> 01:26:04,416
Crush 'em.

1559
01:26:08,333 --> 01:26:11,250
- [woman] So, this is their shot?
- [man] It is a big deal to be here.

1560
01:26:11,333 --> 01:26:13,413
[woman] What kind of advice
do you have for this guy?

1561
01:26:13,458 --> 01:26:17,541
[man] This guy? Yeah, I've seen him play.
He's got a lot of talent. He's got it all.

1562
01:26:17,625 --> 01:26:20,958
He can do a bit of everything.
I don't think he needs any advice from me.

1563
01:26:21,708 --> 01:26:24,208
{\an8}Yeah, most guys
in your position would not be here.

1564
01:26:24,291 --> 01:26:26,958
{\an8}You're already a lottery pick.
So what's your goal?

1565
01:26:27,041 --> 01:26:29,625
{\an8}Just gonna tear it up
and dominate and let the world know.

1566
01:26:29,708 --> 01:26:30,791
{\an8}You like that, Khris?

1567
01:26:30,875 --> 01:26:33,208
- Cocky bastard, ain't he?
- Yeah.

1568
01:26:34,291 --> 01:26:36,125
You against you. All right?

1569
01:26:36,791 --> 01:26:39,375
We've done this a hundred times.
It's just another workout.

1570
01:26:42,291 --> 01:26:43,500
You're an iceberg.

1571
01:26:43,583 --> 01:26:45,666
Focus. Kick some ass.

<i>- Te quiero, mama.</i>

1575

Have fun out there.
Where do you wanna sit?

1576
01:26:57,125 --> 01:26:59,541
- Double D! I see you!
- Yeah! Hey, Leon.

1577
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:04,833

Damn. He can fly, man.

01:27:46,291 --> 01:27:48,291

- Yes, sir.

1583
01:27:48,958 --> 01:27:50,041

It's from football.

1587
01:28:11,416 --> 01:28:13,666
Okay. Well, then, soccer is good.

1588
01:28:15,291 --> 01:28:18,750
I hate soccer. I can't say that.
I really do hate that sport.

1589
01:28:21,583 --> 01:28:23,000
He's quick, but can he shoot?

1590
01:28:26,750 --> 01:28:27,833
He can shoot.

<i>Fran Fraschilla here

1596
01:28:49,875 --> 01:28:52,458
Bo Cruz and Kermit Wilts
crushed it yesterday,

1597
01:28:52,541 --> 01:28:55,500
blowing the roof off
with the speed and agility drills.

1598
01:28:55,583 --> 01:28:57,916
I cannot wait for this match-up.

1599
01:28:58,000 --> 01:29:00,333
We've been watching Kermit
since his AAU days.

1600
01:29:00,416 --> 01:29:02,375
We know he's gonna be an NBA star,

1601
01:29:02,458 --> 01:29:05,125
but this kid, Bo Cruz,
he's come out of nowhere.

1602
01:29:05,208 --> 01:29:07,875
I thought I knew
every international player on the planet,

1603
01:29:07,958 --> 01:29:10,083
but this kid is a revelation.

1604
01:29:10,958 --> 01:29:12,250
It'll be a good game.

1605
01:29:12,333 --> 01:29:15,541
Of course he's nervous, but I told him
the whole Clyde Drexler

1606
01:29:15,625 --> 01:29:18,541
fainting-before-every-game story,
and that calmed him down.

1607
01:29:18,625 --> 01:29:22,208
Clyde... That was me who fainted
before every meet, not Clyde Drexler.

1608
01:29:22,291 --> 01:29:24,666
That was you? Sorry. Just…

1609
01:29:24,750 --> 01:29:28,083
Either way, it worked.
He's… He's feeling good.

Get out and go. Run wide.

Oh, okay. I see what's going on.
That's your mom.

Is it legal to have a kid
with your mom in Spain?

1654
01:32:26,541 --> 01:32:29,125
- Stanley, we got it.
- You don't have it.

1655
01:32:29,875 --> 01:32:31,500
[softly] Jesus Christ.

1656
01:32:33,208 --> 01:32:34,875
Don't got it. All right.

1657

[chuckles]

1658
01:32:45,041 --> 01:32:47,500
Where's her mama anyway?
How come she ain't here?

1659
01:32:47,583 --> 01:32:49,750
She probably shackin' it up
with somebody else.

1660
01:32:50,541 --> 01:32:52,166
Tell her to shack it up with me.

1661
01:32:52,250 --> 01:32:55,125
I'd be a great stepdad.
Give her a real man to look up to.

1662

Huh? What you got?

1663
01:33:00,958 --> 01:33:02,958
Keep coming. Keep coming.

1664
01:33:03,708 --> 01:33:05,041
Good. Good. Good.

1665
01:33:07,791 --> 01:33:09,416
Look. She likes me.

1672

This is a problem. Kermit's really…</i>

1674

"Violent kid from a violent neighborhood."

1675

You know how it works.

1676

Ron Artest?

1677
01:34:05,000 --> 01:34:07,875
He beat up the entire city of Detroit,
and everybody loves him.

1678
01:34:07,958 --> 01:34:10,291
Just give it some time.
That's all it takes.

1679
01:34:10,375 --> 01:34:12,583
You know,
everybody loves a redemption story.

1680
01:34:13,333 --> 01:34:16,375
Some people don't get one.
Just keep falling.

1681
01:34:17,000 --> 01:34:20,791
Shit, he was playing too. God damn it.

1682
01:34:20,875 --> 01:34:21,875
[Leon] Hmm.

1683
01:34:55,208 --> 01:34:57,041
[in Spanish] You played marvelously.

1684
01:34:58,125 --> 01:34:59,250
Mama, don't.

1685
01:35:00,541 --> 01:35:01,541
Look at me.

1686
01:35:03,125 --> 01:35:05,666
Don't you see how incredible you are?

1687
01:35:07,750 --> 01:35:09,208
You carry this weight.

1688
01:35:10,208 --> 01:35:12,875
All that you do for Lucia, for me,

1689
01:35:14,125 --> 01:35:15,458
it's never enough.

1690
01:35:16,625 --> 01:35:17,708
All this love…

1691
01:35:20,125 --> 01:35:21,750
And no love for yourself.

1692
01:35:24,875 --> 01:35:26,500
When I first saw you here…

1693
01:35:28,666 --> 01:35:30,375
The day we arrived,

1694
01:35:30,458 --> 01:35:31,750
you looked…

1695
01:35:33,666 --> 01:35:35,125
Different.

1696
01:35:35,208 --> 01:35:36,375
You looked lighter,

1697
01:35:37,583 --> 01:35:39,833
like the weight was lifted.

1698
01:35:41,333 --> 01:35:44,375
And I think that Stanley does for you

1699
01:35:45,166 --> 01:35:46,833
what you do for us.

1700
01:35:47,833 --> 01:35:50,458
He put all the weight on him

1701
01:35:51,500 --> 01:35:52,958
so you can be you.

1702
01:35:53,875 --> 01:35:55,708
He is <i>your</i> oak tree.

1703
01:35:57,166 --> 01:36:00,083
You can say goodbye
to pro basketball here,

1704
01:36:01,375 --> 01:36:05,250
but you don't need to say goodbye
to what this man has given you.

[Stanley] Sorry I couldn't get you guys

01:36:22,458 --> 01:36:23,458
[Bo] It's fine.

1709
01:36:26,125 --> 01:36:29,500
So, if Sixers weren't paying,
who was paying?

1710
01:36:31,625 --> 01:36:33,666
[sighs] Me and... Me and T.

On top of the porn addiction, yes.

1714
01:36:44,833 --> 01:36:47,166
I… I'm gonna pay you back.

1715
01:36:47,250 --> 01:36:48,250
[Stanley] What? No.

1716
01:36:48,875 --> 01:36:49,875
Coaching you.

1717
01:36:50,708 --> 01:36:52,625
