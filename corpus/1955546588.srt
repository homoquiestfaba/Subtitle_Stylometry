2
00:00:38,438 --> 00:00:41,407
I'm here.

3
00:00:46,546 --> 00:00:49,447
Don't wander alone like that.

4
00:00:52,318 --> 00:00:56,254
- You scared me, you know.
- I'm sorry.

5
00:00:56,289 --> 00:01:00,487
Let's go home already.

6
00:01:08,334 --> 00:01:15,240
- Mom, I found it.
- Really? Good, let's go home.

7
00:01:49,275 --> 00:01:53,234
''25 years later. ''

8
00:02:43,363 --> 00:02:45,456
I got into the car at 2.

9
00:02:45,532 --> 00:02:48,524
But then, I was going here.

10
00:02:48,535 --> 00:02:50,366
Well, I thought I was coming here.

11
00:02:50,403 --> 00:02:54,339
But then Georgia, wanted
to go to the loft.

12
00:02:54,374 --> 00:03:00,370
You know I want to head home,
so then I had to go to the loft.

13
00:03:00,413 --> 00:03:05,282
And when we got there, he was like...
Well, now I want to take a nap.

14
00:03:05,285 --> 00:03:09,483
Then I'm waiting for her,
until she wake up and then...

15
00:03:09,522 --> 00:03:15,222
I fell asleep. I have
been asleep all day.

16
00:03:20,333 --> 00:03:22,233
Are you angry?

17
00:03:22,268 --> 00:03:23,496
Okay, how angry you think I should be?

18
00:03:23,536 --> 00:03:26,334
You think I should be, really
angry, little bit angry?

19
00:03:26,372 --> 00:03:28,363
What do you think it would
be appropriate right now?

20
00:03:28,408 --> 00:03:32,310
- What's the good response?
- A little angry.

21
00:03:36,516 --> 00:03:40,418
- Can you be less angry?
- We're not gonna fight about this.

22
00:03:41,254 --> 00:03:44,348
- Fine by me.
- I'm just not gonna do it.

23
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:47,223
The same old things.

24
00:03:47,393 --> 00:03:48,417
Going over and over again.

25
00:03:48,494 --> 00:03:52,362
Then I get angry cause the only time
I get to see you is when you hungover.

26
00:03:52,365 --> 00:03:54,230
And you stay home all day and watch TV.

27
00:03:54,267 --> 00:03:57,236
And then you say being
at work is affecting you.

28
00:03:57,270 --> 00:03:59,261
- And that isn't true.
- And I say...

29
00:03:59,305 --> 00:04:01,296
you're doing nothing
to change the situation.

30
00:04:01,307 --> 00:04:03,366
And then you told me you're gonna prove
me wrong and then I catch you lying.

31
00:04:03,376 --> 00:04:07,312
Lying again, to me, to yourself. It's the
same old day and we're just talking in circles.

32
00:04:07,347 --> 00:04:10,441
- I just getting so tired of it!
- Tim.

33
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:16,479
Listen...

34
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:21,258
Georgia wanted to go, I
didn't even want to go.

35
00:04:21,294 --> 00:04:23,421
Who the fuck is Georgia?

36
00:04:24,464 --> 00:04:27,331
Natasha.

37
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:36,299
Glori, you are... You're a mess.

38
00:04:36,342 --> 00:04:41,473
You are out of control and I love you,
but I cannot deal with you in that state.

39
00:04:41,514 --> 00:04:45,245
- What are you talking about? - So, I've packed
your things, they're in the bed room.

40
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:47,515
- You can keep the cases.
- What...?

41
00:04:48,254 --> 00:04:48,515
I think it would be best for both of us
if you were not here when I got back, okay?

42
00:04:52,325 --> 00:04:54,316
- So...
- Tim.

43
00:04:54,327 --> 00:04:55,351
Goodbye.

44
00:04:55,395 --> 00:04:57,488
- I'm sorry.
- Tim!

45
00:04:58,264 --> 00:04:59,424
Tim!

46
00:05:13,546 --> 00:05:16,413
- He's gone.
- Thank God.

47
00:05:16,416 --> 00:05:20,443
- It's disgusting.
- I didn't know.

48
00:05:22,255 --> 00:05:25,520
I don't know, I never
done anything like that.

49
00:05:25,525 --> 00:05:27,254
Probably not.

50
00:05:27,293 --> 00:05:30,490
Gloria, where's the plug?
My phone is on red right now.

51
00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:33,328
Who wants to order Chinese food?

52
00:05:33,366 --> 00:05:36,494
- No, I want Chinese food.
- That's healthy.

53
00:05:36,536 --> 00:05:39,437
Are you ready?

54
00:05:50,450 --> 00:05:54,443
''COLLOSAL.''

55
00:07:42,428 --> 00:07:46,262
- Oscar?
- Gloria?

56
00:07:46,432 --> 00:07:50,232
- Wow!
- Wow...

57
00:07:51,404 --> 00:07:53,463
I can't believe it.

58
00:07:53,506 --> 00:07:57,237
Oh, My God. It's a
miracle I recognize you.

59
00:07:57,343 --> 00:08:00,244
- Well, yeah... I mean.
- Anyway, hi.

60
00:08:00,313 --> 00:08:03,248
- Yeah, hi. Hello
- Hi...

61
00:08:03,249 --> 00:08:04,511
Wow.

62
00:08:05,251 --> 00:08:08,277
So, what are you doing here?

63
00:08:08,287 --> 00:08:11,347
I needed a vacation and my
parents are at another house...

64
00:08:11,357 --> 00:08:15,293
- and you know, I haven't been up here in so long.
So it's like... you know - Sure, yeah...

65
00:08:15,328 --> 00:08:19,230
What are you doing now? Like right now.

66
00:08:19,465 --> 00:08:22,491
- Nothing.
- Wanna hang out?

67
00:08:23,402 --> 00:08:26,303
- Yeah. Sure.
- Yeah. Come on, hop in.

68
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:29,240
- Okay, it's cool.
- Yeah.

69
00:08:29,375 --> 00:08:31,468
You okay? You need any help?

70
00:08:39,285 --> 00:08:40,513
Sorry.

71
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:45,423
I'm sorry. I'm just totally blown
away that you're actually here.

72
00:08:46,325 --> 00:08:48,259
Yeah.

73
00:08:49,495 --> 00:08:52,328
Where are we going?

74
00:08:52,498 --> 00:08:57,265
Oh, yeah. We're going
to the work at the bar.

75
00:08:57,270 --> 00:09:00,296
Oh, you're work at bar
with your dad. That's nice.

76
00:09:00,339 --> 00:09:04,298
Well, no. It's mine now. Yeah.

77
00:09:04,343 --> 00:09:09,337
- My dad passed away.
- I'm sorry, Os. I'm really sorry.

78
00:09:09,348 --> 00:09:13,284
- No need to sorry.
- When did that happened?

79
00:09:13,286 --> 00:09:17,245
- A few years ago. Yeah.
- He's a really nice guy.

80
00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:20,521
- I bet your mom having a really
hard time without him. - Well...

81
00:09:20,526 --> 00:09:23,495
she died long before that.

82
00:09:23,529 --> 00:09:26,521
- Jesus, I'm so sorry.
- Yeah.

83
00:09:26,532 --> 00:09:30,468
You're still with me.
Don't you remember?

84
00:09:30,503 --> 00:09:33,370
You went to the funeral.

85
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:44,278
Oh, it looks differrent
than I remember it.

86
00:09:44,283 --> 00:09:48,344
Oh, yeah. I did a
renovation in the wall back.

87
00:09:48,387 --> 00:09:51,220
Yeah, less and less people
start showing up and...

88
00:09:51,257 --> 00:09:56,217
I think the whole country western play
list scaring the people away. Honestly.

89
00:09:58,497 --> 00:10:00,397
Wow!

90
00:10:00,433 --> 00:10:03,493
Hey, I like it.

91
00:10:03,536 --> 00:10:06,232
- Yeah? Really?
- Yeah.

92
00:10:06,272 --> 00:10:09,264
Yeah, I thought you would.
It's more refined, right?

93
00:10:10,242 --> 00:10:15,270
Yeah. I just wanted something that had
a little bit more of classic feeling bar.

94
00:10:15,514 --> 00:10:21,453
You know? Something that does not too
rely on theme or anything like that.

95
00:10:21,487 --> 00:10:24,456
- Well, there's a theme.
- No, it doesn't.

96
00:10:24,523 --> 00:10:28,391
No, I mean it's got a bite, yeah.
Sure, but it doesn't have a theme.

97
00:10:28,427 --> 00:10:32,227
No, where would the
theme be? Like a bar?

98
00:10:32,264 --> 00:10:35,461
- Isn't this used to be bigger?
- Yeah. Yeah, good memory. Yeah.

99
00:10:35,501 --> 00:10:40,336
I just ended up shutting that down.
Due to the people and everything, but...

100
00:10:40,373 --> 00:10:43,342
It's alright. I got a buddy that comes
every now and then and helps me out.

101
00:10:43,342 --> 00:10:46,402
Most of the time I gotta
spend for myself though.

102
00:10:47,413 --> 00:10:49,438
You alright?

103
00:10:49,482 --> 00:10:52,349
- You just...
- Oh.

104
00:10:52,351 --> 00:10:55,411
It's the nervous tick I have,
I have this itch right here...

105
00:10:55,454 --> 00:10:58,389
- You look like a monkey.
- I look like a monkey.

106
00:10:59,425 --> 00:11:03,225
So what? You're Oscar secret...?

107
00:11:03,262 --> 00:11:06,231
- No.
- We don't know anything about you.

108
00:11:06,265 --> 00:11:11,396
We were friends in elementary school and then
I moved to New York and lived there ever since.

109
00:11:11,437 --> 00:11:14,497
Now I'm just visiting for a few days.

110
00:11:16,375 --> 00:11:19,367
- You know what your problem is?
- What's my problem?

111
00:11:19,378 --> 00:11:23,246
I used to live in New York too, a while
back. I worked there for a few months.

112
00:11:23,315 --> 00:11:26,478
A print shop then I meet this
guy, who lost his passport,

113
00:11:26,485 --> 00:11:28,510
he couldn't afford a new
one, so I helped him out.

114
00:11:28,554 --> 00:11:30,522
Let him stay with me for a while.

115
00:11:30,523 --> 00:11:34,254
After a week living with me, I find
out the police are looking for him,

116
00:11:34,326 --> 00:11:36,317
because he beat up his boyfriend.

117
00:11:36,362 --> 00:11:38,489
- Hey, Bart.
- Sorry...

118
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:41,227
- What's my problem?
- What's your problem?

119
00:11:41,267 --> 00:11:43,292
Yeah. You asked me did I know
what my problem is, then you...

120
00:11:43,335 --> 00:11:46,327
told the story and I don't know
what does it have to do with me?

121
00:11:46,372 --> 00:11:48,499
I didn't ask you that.

122
00:11:48,507 --> 00:11:50,407
- Did I?
- Yeah, you did. No, sorry...

123
00:11:50,443 --> 00:11:53,412
He has this problem
whenever there's someone new,

124
00:11:53,446 --> 00:11:56,244
he got very eager for babbling along.

125
00:11:56,282 --> 00:11:58,512
That is totally not true.

126
00:11:59,318 --> 00:12:01,252
Sorry.

127
00:12:06,525 --> 00:12:10,427
What do you think of the
main head? Does itjams a lot?

128
00:12:12,465 --> 00:12:15,525
The truth is I don't
have a fucking idea.

129
00:12:21,307 --> 00:12:23,400
Right back here.

130
00:12:24,376 --> 00:12:27,436
Holy shit! Oscar, the horses!

131
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:30,449
- Oh, yeah... no.
- Oh, my God. You kept this as the way it was.

132
00:12:30,483 --> 00:12:32,508
It's awesome!

133
00:12:33,252 --> 00:12:35,413
Why don't you use it? It's so great!

134
00:12:35,454 --> 00:12:37,285
Well, I told you I
didn't really need it.

135
00:12:37,289 --> 00:12:40,452
Don't really need it. We ran out of
money in the middle of the renovation.

136
00:12:40,493 --> 00:12:43,326
I couldn't afford to finish it.

137
00:12:43,362 --> 00:12:46,229
This is his dark little secret.

138
00:12:46,265 --> 00:12:48,495
Like a lower back tatoo. Hey!

139
00:12:50,236 --> 00:12:51,396
- Oscar.
- Yeah?

140
00:12:51,437 --> 00:12:54,235
You're nuts. This place is magical!

141
00:12:54,273 --> 00:12:57,436
It's because it's not
literral anymore. It's like...

142
00:12:57,476 --> 00:13:00,343
It's actually ironic now.

143
00:13:00,379 --> 00:13:03,439
- Want a Tic Tac?
- Why? Does my breath smell?

144
00:13:04,350 --> 00:13:06,409
Hey, Oscar.

145
00:13:06,418 --> 00:13:09,410
- You got any tea bags?
- Why? You want a cup of tea?

146
00:13:09,455 --> 00:13:14,415
No, I want a tea bag. With a good
little string and that paper at the end.

147
00:13:14,426 --> 00:13:16,485
Yes, I'm familiar with the
concept. What do you need it for?

148
00:13:16,529 --> 00:13:19,396
- I'm gonna do a trick.
- I don't know your name.

149
00:13:19,398 --> 00:13:22,299
- Joel.
- Gloria.

150
00:13:23,335 --> 00:13:25,428
Why are the boys do that?

151
00:13:25,471 --> 00:13:27,336
What?

152
00:13:27,339 --> 00:13:31,366
They always introduced you all the
guys except for the good looking ones.

153
00:13:31,410 --> 00:13:33,401
One.

154
00:13:33,412 --> 00:13:38,349
What do you wanna
see? I'm gonna show it.

155
00:13:39,418 --> 00:13:43,514
It's like a fucking Wes Anderson
movie in here, Oscar. I love it!

156
00:13:43,556 --> 00:13:46,491
Yeah, I wish the song were better.

157
00:13:49,361 --> 00:13:54,298
When we were kids back at school, every year
they have this short story contest in the spring.

158
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:57,359
And Gloria here would
always win. Always.

159
00:13:57,403 --> 00:14:00,270
Oh, come on! My stories were terrible.

160
00:14:00,306 --> 00:14:02,331
Oh, yeah? Well...

161
00:14:03,375 --> 00:14:06,310
I bet they're better
than the mind, so...

162
00:14:07,513 --> 00:14:11,472
- I'm gonna get more booze.
- I didn't know that you want to be a writer.

163
00:14:13,419 --> 00:14:17,515
No, I didn't. That was the point,
dumb dumb. I'm not. She's the writer.

164
00:14:17,523 --> 00:14:20,458
I'm not a writer. I'm not like...

165
00:14:20,492 --> 00:14:25,361
I don't write fiction, I write
articles for an online magazine.

166

00:29:16,321 --> 00:29:21,258
the entire city of Seoul and it's
surrounding suburbs are on high alert.

You see, I don't think it's alive.

What do you mean?

336
00:29:25,330 --> 00:29:26,456
I mean...

337
00:29:26,464 --> 00:29:28,432
it's not an animal.

338
00:29:28,433 --> 00:29:31,300
It's like... a machine.

339
00:29:31,302 --> 00:29:35,329
And it's been operated by
remote control or something.

340
00:29:36,274 --> 00:29:39,505
You ever notice how
it'sjust keep moving...

341
00:29:39,511 --> 00:29:43,470
destroying everything in it's
path, but it never looks down?

342
00:29:45,416 --> 00:29:51,355
If you were walking, surrounded by buildings
up to your waist or your shoulder...

343
00:29:51,356 --> 00:29:55,258
wouldn't you look around
to see where you were going?

344
00:29:55,493 --> 00:30:01,489
Even if you want to destroy everything it
makes no sense to keep staring straight ahead...

345
00:30:01,533 --> 00:30:04,263
if everything is below you.

346
00:30:04,536 --> 00:30:06,470

- Shit.

00:40:10,341 --> 00:40:13,504
Shit, I don't want to be me
anymore. I don't... How do I get out?

502
00:40:13,544 --> 00:40:16,308
Which way is the river?
I don't know where it is.

503
00:40:16,313 --> 00:40:17,337
- Gloria.
- I don't wanna be here anymore.

504
00:40:17,348 --> 00:40:18,315
Could you just show
me where the river is?

505
00:40:18,315 --> 00:40:19,475
- Holy shit!
- What?

506
00:40:19,517 --> 00:40:21,348

01:16:19,508 --> 01:16:23,342

there, in that corner booth.

Break one of the windows.

1005

You and me, we could get a big old
fist right here in front of anyone.

irresponsible things to do.

bourbon or something like that, but..
