561
01:13:12,327 --> 01:13:13,361
You didn't know that?

562
01:13:14,729 --> 01:13:17,098
His visa ran out ages ago,

563
01:13:17,132 --> 01:13:18,299
but you know, Liam.

564
01:13:19,467 --> 01:13:21,035
But he's okay, we're
actually gonna meet up

565
01:13:21,069 --> 01:13:23,004
in Thailand in a month.

566
01:13:24,239 --> 01:13:25,971
That's really good.

567
01:13:25,973 --> 01:13:27,208
Tell him hi from me.

568
01:13:27,242 --> 01:13:28,076
I will.

569
01:13:31,746 --> 01:13:33,148
Can I take you to breakfast?

570
01:13:36,785 --> 01:13:38,186
And we do this just like,

571
01:13:38,219 --> 01:13:40,622
okay, not the cappuccino.

572
01:13:40,655 --> 01:13:43,825
Oh my God, this is literally
my version of heaven right now.

573
01:13:46,294 --> 01:13:47,862
Do you ever get homesick?

574
01:13:47,896 --> 01:13:49,030
I get bar sick.

575
01:13:50,131 --> 01:13:51,466
Like people really want to be,

576
01:13:51,499 --> 01:13:53,501
and all of a sudden
they want to be home.

577
01:13:53,535 --> 01:13:58,540
But I really want to
be far away from home

578
01:13:59,441 --> 01:14:01,242
all of a sudden and then I go.

579
01:14:02,577 --> 01:14:05,011
You know there's
actually a word for that.

580
01:14:05,013 --> 01:14:06,147
Yeah?

581
01:14:06,181 --> 01:14:08,016
Fernweh.

582
01:14:08,383 --> 01:14:15,089
Fernweh is a longing for
distance, just pure distance.

583
01:14:18,860 --> 01:14:22,230
Do you know what (SPEAKING
IN A FOREIGN LANGUAGE) means?

584
01:14:22,263 --> 01:14:23,097
No.

585
01:14:26,034 --> 01:14:28,503
Means sobering up
by drinking more.

586
01:15:24,592 --> 01:15:25,426
Hey.

587
01:16:37,599 --> 01:16:41,703
(SPEAKING IN A FOREIGN LANGUAGE)

588
01:18:47,595 --> 01:18:52,201
I like to be submissive,
do you know what that means?

589
01:18:55,336 --> 01:18:56,671
Get undressed.

590
01:20:08,676 --> 01:20:13,681
Lie on the bed.

591
01:20:17,718 --> 01:20:18,553
Face down.

592
01:20:59,094 --> 01:20:59,861
Left hand.

593
01:22:03,491 --> 01:22:04,293
Good.

594
01:23:53,934 --> 01:23:57,305
It doesn't make you
special or interesting

595
01:23:57,339 --> 01:23:58,939
that you like this.

596
01:24:01,642 --> 01:24:02,477
I know.

597
01:24:20,462 --> 01:24:23,398
I like this
presence, the hotels.

598
01:24:28,636 --> 01:24:29,538
I do too.

599
01:24:32,074 --> 01:24:35,976
Nobody uses their public
face in these places.

600
01:24:38,646 --> 01:24:42,117
We shouldn't use (SPEAKING
IN A FOREIGN LANGUAGE),

601
01:24:42,150 --> 01:24:43,485
the public face.

602
01:24:44,486 --> 01:24:45,320
The mask.

603
01:24:47,822 --> 01:24:52,060
When I was a kid, I
used to come here.

604
01:24:56,864 --> 01:24:59,468
With your girlfriend?

605
01:24:59,501 --> 01:25:02,370
She wasn't my girlfriend,
but she came here

606
01:25:02,404 --> 01:25:03,238
with me.

607
01:25:04,772 --> 01:25:06,807
So you got to see
her without the mask.

608
01:25:40,774 --> 01:25:45,779
Sometimes the mask is prettier
than the thing behind it.

609
01:25:53,721 --> 01:25:55,423
I could kill you now.

610
01:26:00,761 --> 01:26:01,762
Please do.

611
01:26:08,036 --> 01:26:08,869
Please do.

612
01:26:11,739 --> 01:26:12,574
Do it.

613
01:27:26,181 --> 01:27:28,816
(DOOR BANGING)

614
01:28:14,862 --> 01:28:16,864
Is this really you?

615
01:28:16,897 --> 01:28:17,732
Yes.

616
01:28:29,877 --> 01:28:31,379
You followed me.

617
01:28:34,082 --> 01:28:34,915
Yes.

618
01:28:39,953 --> 01:28:41,955
You're a coward.

619
01:28:48,163 --> 01:28:48,996
It's okay.

620
01:28:52,500 --> 01:28:53,501
It's okay.

I'm glad.
