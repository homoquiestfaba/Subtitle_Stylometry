00:00:19,434 --> 00:00:23,077
<b>WELL WISHES</b>

2
00:00:23,584 --> 00:00:26,584
<b>Subrip: Pix</b>

3
00:00:33,365 --> 00:00:35,734
Tails!

4
00:00:39,704 --> 00:00:40,506
You wanted to see me, sir?

5
00:00:40,539 --> 00:00:41,673
Yes...

6
00:00:41,707 --> 00:00:43,810
Come on in, Mike.

7
00:00:43,843 --> 00:00:45,478
It's Miles, sir.

8
00:00:45,511 --> 00:00:47,380
Miles?

9
00:00:47,412 --> 00:00:49,581
Are you sure it's not Mike?
I could have sworn it was Mike.

10
00:00:49,615 --> 00:00:52,085
I'm pretty sure.

11
00:00:52,118 --> 00:00:53,753
Okay.

12
00:00:53,786 --> 00:00:56,523
Well take a seat, duly noted.

13
00:00:59,524 --> 00:01:02,427
I'm gonna cut right
to the chase here.

14
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:04,096
I got some bad news.

15
00:01:05,331 --> 00:01:07,433
We're gonna have to let you go.

16
00:01:16,441 --> 00:01:18,443
I don't understand that, sir.

17
00:01:18,477 --> 00:01:19,712
Is it because of
the Christmas party?

18
00:01:19,745 --> 00:01:21,746
Because I apologize
for my girlfriend.

19
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:23,748
If it makes any difference, we
received one hell of a rash

20
00:01:23,781 --> 00:01:25,350
from that mistletoe.

21
00:01:25,384 --> 00:01:28,754
No, I thought
that was pretty funny.

22
00:01:28,787 --> 00:01:30,123
But no.
Okay.

23
00:01:30,156 --> 00:01:32,225
This is...

24
00:01:32,257 --> 00:01:33,692
This is just...

25
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:37,662
What about everything I've
done for this company?

26
00:01:37,695 --> 00:01:40,432
You know, it's
strictly financial,

27
00:01:40,465 --> 00:01:43,301
and I am sorry if this...

28
00:01:43,334 --> 00:01:45,637
If you're screwed by
this, I really am.

29
00:01:45,671 --> 00:01:48,541
But on behalf of the entire
staff, I'd like to invite you

30
00:01:48,573 --> 00:01:50,609
to continue attending
our bi-annual bake-off,

31
00:01:50,643 --> 00:01:52,879
both spring and autumn
sweet and savory categories,

32
00:01:52,912 --> 00:01:56,481
best dish wins a gift certificate
to McGillicutty's Seafood!

33
00:01:56,515 --> 00:01:58,150
Shack.

34
00:02:00,686 --> 00:02:03,523
Did you just decide all
this with that quarter?

35
00:02:05,623 --> 00:02:06,825
What quarter?

36
00:02:06,858 --> 00:02:08,293
Sir, the quarter. You
were just tapping it.

37
00:02:08,326 --> 00:02:09,495
It's in your hand.

38
00:02:09,527 --> 00:02:10,562
It's right in your
hand, right here.

39
00:02:10,596 --> 00:02:12,532
Sir, come on.

40
00:02:12,564 --> 00:02:14,533
I don't like
confrontation, Mike.

41
00:02:14,567 --> 00:02:17,637
It's not my strong suit
and if it were up to me,

42
00:02:17,669 --> 00:02:18,837
everybody could keep their jobs.

43
00:02:18,871 --> 00:02:20,907
It is up to you,
sir, you're the boss.

44
00:02:20,939 --> 00:02:22,641
And you're telling me this
is for financial reasons?

45
00:02:22,675 --> 00:02:23,743
I'm the top-earner.

46
00:02:23,776 --> 00:02:25,344
I'm not into
confrontation, okay?

47
00:02:25,377 --> 00:02:28,314
I am sorry.

48
00:02:28,347 --> 00:02:30,917
Just, don't be a stranger.

49
00:02:41,326 --> 00:02:43,562
You go get 'em, slugger.

50
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:47,700
And could you send Miles in
when you go outside, please?

51
00:02:47,733 --> 00:02:49,235
I'm Miles, Shane.

52
00:02:50,301 --> 00:02:52,305
Send the next guy in.

53
00:02:53,938 --> 00:02:54,973
Thank you.

54
00:02:55,007 --> 00:02:56,475
Have a good one.

55
00:02:58,343 --> 00:02:59,878
Thanks a lot, buddy.

56
00:03:05,484 --> 00:03:06,885
Yes! Yes!

57
00:03:06,919 --> 00:03:07,620
Yes!

58
00:03:07,652 --> 00:03:10,389
Yes!

59
00:03:11,623 --> 00:03:14,426
I would like to
introduce you all

60
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:18,798
to the new interim
departmental assistant head

61
00:03:18,830 --> 00:03:21,933
of the regional bureau
of synergy assessment

62
00:03:21,967 --> 00:03:25,538
and strategic alignment, woo!

63
00:03:28,774 --> 00:03:30,475
Hey, sweetie.

64
00:03:32,044 --> 00:03:35,548
I'm making a kale quinoa
and couscous salad tonight.

65
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:37,515
My favorite.

66
00:03:37,549 --> 00:03:39,418
I got laid off today.

67
00:03:39,450 --> 00:03:41,486
You what?

68
00:03:42,854 --> 00:03:44,590
You what?!

69
00:03:46,658 --> 00:03:49,027
Hey.

70
00:03:49,061 --> 00:03:50,462
What happened?

71
00:03:51,830 --> 00:03:53,733
Look at that, baby,
that's beautiful.

72
00:03:53,765 --> 00:03:54,966
Yeah, I know.

73
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,435
I did this for you.

74
00:03:56,467 --> 00:03:59,471
You got all your
favorite colors.

75
00:03:59,504 --> 00:04:00,705
Do you know why
I even did this?

76
00:04:00,739 --> 00:04:02,408
You don't even know
why I did this.

77
00:04:02,441 --> 00:04:03,943
I was gonna tell you
tonight that you could

78
00:04:03,975 --> 00:04:06,312
take my last name
when we get married.

79
00:04:06,344 --> 00:04:09,048
Which is a big deal, Miles.

80
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:11,483
You're not even acknowledging
how much that means,

81
00:04:11,516 --> 00:04:13,786
and now it's completely
ruined, obviously.

82
00:04:13,818 --> 00:04:15,287
It's not ruined, I just...

83
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:16,788
Miles! What are you doing?

84
00:04:16,822 --> 00:04:18,456
Miles.

85
00:04:18,490 --> 00:04:20,026
This is not your hook.

86
00:04:20,059 --> 00:04:21,560
This is your hook.

87
00:04:21,593 --> 00:04:22,494
What even happened?

88
00:04:22,528 --> 00:04:24,530
I'm pretty sure he
decided on a coin toss.

89
00:04:24,562 --> 00:04:25,396
That's ridiculous.

90
00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:26,765
No, I'm
pretty sure he did.

91
00:04:26,798 --> 00:04:28,466
I can't even look
at you right now.

92
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:29,869
What are you doing with
the decorative pillow?

93
00:04:29,901 --> 00:04:31,603
It's in the negative
space, I'm just...

94
00:04:31,637 --> 00:04:33,773
Miles! You're negative space!

95
00:04:33,805 --> 00:04:35,473
They go by color
and pattern, Miles.

96
00:04:35,507 --> 00:04:36,876
I mean, is it hard?

97
00:04:36,908 --> 00:04:38,310
Is it hard? It's not.
I love you.

98
00:04:38,343 --> 00:04:39,478
Don't touch me.

99
00:04:40,579 --> 00:04:42,581
This is just a prime example

100
00:04:42,613 --> 00:04:46,384
of Miles screws everything up!

101
00:04:46,418 --> 00:04:47,386
All the time!

102
00:04:47,418 --> 00:04:48,320
Just keep the candles goin'.

103
00:04:48,353 --> 00:04:49,421
This night is over with.

104
00:04:49,454 --> 00:04:52,524
There's no cuddling, you're
not giving me a back rub.

105
00:04:52,557 --> 00:04:53,959
-Namaste.
-Namaste.

106
00:04:53,992 --> 00:04:55,193
It's seriously like you do
these things on purpose.

107
00:04:55,226 --> 00:04:58,663
"Melissa, it's gonna be so
beautiful when we get married."

108
00:04:58,697 --> 00:05:00,566
Stop talking to me altogether,

109
00:05:00,598 --> 00:05:02,067
because you're
breathing my cat's air,

110
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:04,704
and wasting it on
your stupid thoughts!

111
00:05:09,675 --> 00:05:11,677
I love you!

112
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,634
"Dear Melissa,"

113
00:06:10,502 --> 00:06:13,473
Pick up the phone and
I'll give you a baby!

114
00:06:16,541 --> 00:06:22,581
"Dear Melissa...

115
00:06:27,052 --> 00:06:34,026
"Dear Melissa...

116
00:06:38,463 --> 00:06:44,704
"Dear Melissa...

117
00:06:52,944 --> 00:06:55,415
"Dear Melissa..."

118
00:07:20,172 --> 00:07:22,141
Golden pepper.

119
00:07:26,011 --> 00:07:27,246
Alright.

120
00:07:27,278 --> 00:07:28,548
Okay.

121
00:07:30,281 --> 00:07:32,183
Come on.

122
00:07:32,216 --> 00:07:33,786
Come on.

123
00:07:38,956 --> 00:07:40,192
Rip off!
Listen.

124
00:07:40,225 --> 00:07:41,594
Lady Liberty.

125
00:07:41,627 --> 00:07:43,528
I sell 'em, I don't
make 'em, all right?

126
00:07:43,562 --> 00:07:44,896
Move along.

127
00:07:44,930 --> 00:07:46,165
No.

128
00:07:46,197 --> 00:07:47,233
Pennies make dollars.

129
00:07:47,266 --> 00:07:49,001
It's common sense!

130
00:09:22,628 --> 00:09:23,930
Jack?

131
00:09:29,067 --> 00:09:30,336
-Coins...
-Yeah.

132
00:09:30,369 --> 00:09:31,336
From wishing wells...?

133
00:09:31,370 --> 00:09:32,238
Yeah.

134
00:09:33,672 --> 00:09:35,274
I'm serious, man.

135
00:09:35,307 --> 00:09:37,209
Listen, all the municipalities,

136
00:09:37,241 --> 00:09:38,309
they don't have enough
budget these days,

137
00:09:38,342 --> 00:09:40,979
to send people out to take
care of the local fountains.

138
00:09:42,648 --> 00:09:44,716
So we can come in, help
out the local governments,

139
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:45,918
even give more money to charity

140
00:09:45,951 --> 00:09:47,385
than what they typically get.

141
00:09:47,418 --> 00:09:49,654
And then we keep
everything on top of that,

142
00:09:49,687 --> 00:09:51,322
which is gonna be a
nice chunk of change.

143
00:09:51,355 --> 00:09:53,391
We haven't talked in
weeks and you call me up

144
00:09:53,424 --> 00:09:55,860
out of the blue with
this, with a Ponzi scheme?

145
00:09:55,894 --> 00:09:58,297
First up, it's not a
Ponzi scheme, all right?

146
00:09:58,330 --> 00:10:01,367
Second off, I was
embarrassed, man.

147
00:10:01,399 --> 00:10:04,403
Well why would
you be embarrassed?

148
00:10:07,072 --> 00:10:08,072
I should have
called you, I'm sorry.

149
00:10:08,105 --> 00:10:09,107
It's cool. I get it.

150
00:10:09,140 --> 00:10:10,341
Don't apologize.

151
00:10:10,375 --> 00:10:13,011
We can be our own bosses,

152
00:10:13,044 --> 00:10:14,312
then we can go ahead and
enjoy the liberating freedom

153
00:10:14,346 --> 00:10:15,346
we've always talked about.

154
00:10:15,379 --> 00:10:17,015
Is it legal?

155
00:10:17,048 --> 00:10:18,850
Of course it's legal. I've
Googled it, Binged, Yahooed it.

156
00:10:18,884 --> 00:10:19,884
I even asked Jeeves.

157
00:10:19,918 --> 00:10:21,086
Who the hell's Jeeves?

158
00:10:21,119 --> 00:10:22,086
Well, I tried to ask
Jeeves but I don't think

159
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:24,389
he's around anymore or
else he just goes by Ask.

160
00:10:24,423 --> 00:10:26,725
I must've... missed
the Jeeves train.

161
00:10:26,758 --> 00:10:27,993
Come on, buddy.

162
00:10:28,025 --> 00:10:29,260
You and me?

163
00:10:29,293 --> 00:10:31,096
This is our ticket.

164
00:10:31,129 --> 00:10:32,431
When are you thinking
of starting this thing?

165
00:10:32,464 --> 00:10:33,899
Tonight.

166
00:10:37,735 --> 00:10:39,004
I'm talkin' about
makin' money, man.

167
00:10:39,037 --> 00:10:41,774
Makin' a lot of money.

168
00:10:41,807 --> 00:10:43,442
Do you know how messed
up it is out there?

169
00:10:43,475 --> 00:10:45,144
You should know how
messed up it is out there.

170
00:10:45,177 --> 00:10:47,879
I picked you up wearing a
dress and a foam hat today.

171
00:10:47,913 --> 00:10:49,447
People are struggling
to find jobs.

172
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:51,149
It is a privilege to have a job.

173
00:10:51,182 --> 00:10:53,985
And I'm glad that
I have one, Miles.

174
00:10:54,019 --> 00:10:55,721
Okay, as much fun as
I know it would be,

175
00:10:55,754 --> 00:10:57,423
I just do not have the stamina

176
00:10:57,456 --> 00:10:58,456
for these kinds
of games anymore.

177
00:10:58,490 --> 00:11:00,324
This is an opportunity,
a legitimate opportunity

178
00:11:00,357 --> 00:11:01,359
with infinite potential.

179
00:11:01,393 --> 00:11:03,162
You sound like
Jerry from work.

180
00:11:03,195 --> 00:11:04,763
Enough about
Jerry, will you stop?

181
00:11:04,796 --> 00:11:06,198
You always talk about Jerry.

182
00:11:06,230 --> 00:11:07,932
Just, "Jerry Jerry Jerry,"
you're like so obsessed

183
00:11:07,966 --> 00:11:09,435
with freakin' Jerry, just,

184
00:11:09,467 --> 00:11:11,437
look at the stars.

185
00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:13,205
Jerry.

186
00:11:17,975 --> 00:11:20,046
Why don't you
just think about it?

187
00:11:21,178 --> 00:11:22,179
Okay.

188
00:11:22,214 --> 00:11:24,717
You're out of your gourd
but I will think about it.

189
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:26,384
Don't hurt yourself.

190
00:11:29,788 --> 00:11:31,255
Gotta go.
Reach for it!

191
00:11:31,288 --> 00:11:32,758
Reach for the stars, buddy!

192
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:37,355
Lady Liberty.

193
00:12:37,389 --> 00:12:38,823
Golden Pepper scratch off?

194
00:12:38,856 --> 00:12:42,093
Nope, actually
just a coffee today.

195
00:12:52,269 --> 00:12:53,304
You know what?

196
00:12:53,337 --> 00:12:56,908
Actually I'll take 20 of 'em.

197
00:13:01,446 --> 00:13:02,346
Change?

198
00:13:02,379 --> 00:13:03,481
Yeah, I got some,

199
00:13:03,514 --> 00:13:05,384
I got some change.

200
00:13:08,953 --> 00:13:10,288
I got this too.

201
00:13:10,322 --> 00:13:12,256
Take good care of this, this is

202
00:13:12,289 --> 00:13:13,991
actually what's been keeping
me off the streets too,

203
00:13:14,024 --> 00:13:15,494
if you can believe that, sir.

204
00:13:16,427 --> 00:13:18,297
There you go.

205
00:13:18,330 --> 00:13:19,898
These are for you too.

206
00:13:19,931 --> 00:13:22,301
I don't much play the lottery,

207
00:13:23,567 --> 00:13:25,136
but thank you.

208
00:13:25,169 --> 00:13:26,370
God bless you.

209
00:13:26,403 --> 00:13:32,443
Good luck, sir.

210
00:13:38,115 --> 00:13:39,884
Have we met before?

211
00:13:39,918 --> 00:13:41,921
You look familiar.

212
00:13:43,421 --> 00:13:44,355
Okay.

213
00:13:44,389 --> 00:13:45,957
Well maybe you can help me out.

214
00:13:45,990 --> 00:13:46,958
I'm trying to figure out
where all the fountains are

215
00:13:46,991 --> 00:13:47,625
around here.

216
00:13:47,658 --> 00:13:48,626
Fountains?

217
00:13:48,659 --> 00:13:50,495
Yeah, wishing fountains.

218
00:13:51,629 --> 00:13:54,232
Architectural
enthusiast, are we?

219
00:13:54,265 --> 00:13:55,399
Just a growing interest.

220
00:13:56,467 --> 00:13:59,203
My name is Miles, sir.

221
00:13:59,236 --> 00:14:00,338
Durwood.

222
00:14:00,371 --> 00:14:02,907
Pleasure to meet you, Durwood.

223
00:14:02,941 --> 00:14:03,908
Nice ride.

224
00:14:03,942 --> 00:14:04,876
Thank you, thank you.

225
00:14:04,909 --> 00:14:07,312
It's a '57 wagon, obviously.

226
00:14:07,345 --> 00:14:08,947
I know.

227
00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:10,014
I had a coupe.

228
00:14:10,048 --> 00:14:10,948
Really?

229
00:14:10,981 --> 00:14:11,949
First car.

230
00:14:11,982 --> 00:14:12,984
Yeah?

231
00:14:13,018 --> 00:14:14,485
That's cool.

232
00:14:14,519 --> 00:14:15,953
Yeah, everything's
original in this one.

233
00:14:15,986 --> 00:14:18,155
Interior, engine, all
the numbers are right.

234
00:14:18,188 --> 00:14:19,357
It's been in the
family a long time.

235
00:14:19,390 --> 00:14:21,360
It's been in a good family.

236
00:14:22,394 --> 00:14:23,995
All right well,

237
00:14:24,028 --> 00:14:26,465
I hope you win big with those.

238
00:14:31,135 --> 00:14:34,472
Hey Miles.

239
00:14:34,505 --> 00:14:37,009
Thanks for the generosity.

240
00:14:38,143 --> 00:14:40,012
You take care, sir.

241
00:15:30,260 --> 00:15:32,029
Hi!
Hey.

242
00:15:32,062 --> 00:15:32,997
Brought you a coffee.

243
00:15:33,030 --> 00:15:33,631
Thanks, man.

244
00:15:33,664 --> 00:15:35,567
Come on in, come on in.

245
00:15:40,138 --> 00:15:42,240
You're livin' it up!

246
00:15:42,273 --> 00:15:43,608
Making pillow forts again?

247
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:45,509
Of course I've been
makin' pillow forts.

248
00:15:45,543 --> 00:15:47,446
Shouldn't you be at work?

249
00:15:47,479 --> 00:15:49,081
If I had a job.

250
00:15:49,114 --> 00:15:50,014
I quit.

251
00:15:50,048 --> 00:15:51,283
Okay, all right.

252
00:15:51,316 --> 00:15:52,350
Why...

253
00:15:52,384 --> 00:15:54,119
Okay, why'd you quit?

254
00:15:54,152 --> 00:15:55,387
I thought
you'd be excited.

255
00:15:55,419 --> 00:15:56,721
No, I just thought
that you liked that job,

256
00:15:56,754 --> 00:15:58,389
what are talkin' about?

257
00:15:58,423 --> 00:16:00,325
Yeah, I did like that job,
or I thought I liked that job,

258
00:16:00,357 --> 00:16:03,361
or I was pretending
to like my job but,

259
00:16:03,394 --> 00:16:05,764
I don't like my job.

260
00:16:05,797 --> 00:16:07,766
I don't like pretending
that Jerry Wunderlick's

261
00:16:07,798 --> 00:16:10,201
jokes are funny, I don't
like the cookie-cutter cards

262
00:16:10,235 --> 00:16:12,269
that I've got to put on
those shelves every day

263
00:16:12,302 --> 00:16:14,306
and they're not letting me
put my own stuff up there?

264
00:16:14,339 --> 00:16:16,008
I'm being artistically
repressed.

265
00:16:16,041 --> 00:16:17,475
That's their loss, Jack.

266
00:16:17,509 --> 00:16:19,177
Then I started thinking about
everything that you've been

267
00:16:19,210 --> 00:16:21,580
saying about creating
something of our own.

268
00:16:21,613 --> 00:16:24,449
Something adventurous,
something unique.

269
00:16:24,481 --> 00:16:28,352
About, the liberating freedom.

270
00:16:28,385 --> 00:16:29,721
And I realized, that's
what I'm missing.

271
00:16:29,754 --> 00:16:32,758
That's what I don't
have, that's what I need.

272
00:16:32,791 --> 00:16:34,493
It's what I want.

273
00:16:34,525 --> 00:16:37,428
So, I mean...

274
00:16:37,461 --> 00:16:39,497
Even if we fail,

275
00:16:39,530 --> 00:16:43,201
I'm in.

276
00:16:47,438 --> 00:16:48,572
Are we gonna do this?

277
00:16:48,605 --> 00:16:50,442
Okay, okay.

278
00:16:52,409 --> 00:16:54,413
Yeah, I'm a big bear.

279
00:16:58,249 --> 00:17:00,719
It's beautiful.
I know, I know.

280
00:17:00,751 --> 00:17:03,187
I had a cousin that
once peed a penny.

281
00:17:03,221 --> 00:17:04,322
Is that weird?

282
00:17:04,355 --> 00:17:05,524
It's not weird
at all, it's money.

283
00:17:05,557 --> 00:17:07,125
I want 'em up my nose...
What?

284
00:17:07,157 --> 00:17:08,492
Down my throat.

285
00:17:08,526 --> 00:17:10,228
Okay, that's you, man.

286
00:17:10,260 --> 00:17:13,264
Royal sovereign FS44P.

287
00:17:14,432 --> 00:17:16,535
I think we got the king
of coin counters right here.

288
00:17:16,567 --> 00:17:17,435
Look at that hopper!

289
00:17:17,469 --> 00:17:20,639
800 coin capacity,
300 coins per minute.

290
00:17:20,672 --> 00:17:24,442
18,000 an hour.

291
00:17:28,645 --> 00:17:29,681
We're gonna need more of these.

292
00:17:29,713 --> 00:17:30,581
Well that's the goal.

293
00:17:30,615 --> 00:17:32,284
That's the goal.

294
00:17:32,317 --> 00:17:34,086
All right.

295
00:17:34,118 --> 00:17:36,221
Tomorrow we hit up
a fountain together.

296
00:17:36,253 --> 00:17:37,721
Then after that we split
up to cover more ground.

297
00:17:37,755 --> 00:17:39,157
Yeah, got it.

298
00:17:39,190 --> 00:17:40,592
Now, what do you do if
the police come around?

299
00:17:40,625 --> 00:17:44,395
Tell them the truth, but no
more than they need to know.

300
00:17:44,429 --> 00:17:45,697
Routine cleaning.

301
00:17:45,730 --> 00:17:47,098
When you're finished?

302
00:17:47,132 --> 00:17:49,500
Leave five dollars
in pennies and nickels,

303
00:17:49,534 --> 00:17:51,303
to encourage replenishment.

304
00:17:51,336 --> 00:17:52,671
I got this.

305
00:17:54,506 --> 00:17:57,109
You remember that
cold-ass winter?

306
00:17:57,142 --> 00:17:59,878
Like '86, '87?

307
00:17:59,911 --> 00:18:01,712
I do.

308
00:18:01,746 --> 00:18:04,383
This ain't gonna end
up like that, is it?

309
00:18:06,351 --> 00:18:07,452
No.

310
00:18:07,484 --> 00:18:08,820
Not at all.

311
00:19:19,490 --> 00:19:21,626
Do you feel like
a million bucks?

312
00:19:24,429 --> 00:19:27,332
'Cause you look like
a million bucks.

313
00:19:38,742 --> 00:19:40,412
We knew this day would come.

314
00:19:40,444 --> 00:19:44,249
Maybe about a month
before they're replenished?

315
00:19:44,281 --> 00:19:45,383
At least.

316
00:19:45,416 --> 00:19:47,551
High traffic zones might fill
up sooner, but who knows.

317
00:19:47,585 --> 00:19:48,819
What do you think?

318
00:19:48,853 --> 00:19:49,653
Break for a few months
and hope people start

319
00:19:49,686 --> 00:19:51,288
wishing more than ever?

320
00:19:51,321 --> 00:19:53,924
Nah, at this point we
either buckle or we boom.

321
00:19:53,958 --> 00:19:55,360
Boom!

322
00:19:55,893 --> 00:19:57,328
In the morning I'll call around,

323
00:19:57,362 --> 00:19:59,397
check all the
statewide registries.

324
00:19:59,430 --> 00:20:01,466
If there's a fountain to
be farmed, we'll find it.

325
00:20:01,499 --> 00:20:03,468
Midweek, get you a
firm route planned out.

326
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:05,470
Well you're coming along
with me on this one, right?

327
00:20:05,502 --> 00:20:06,704
No man, you're the collector.

328
00:20:06,738 --> 00:20:08,573
Nah, you gotta come
along on this one, man.

329
00:20:08,605 --> 00:20:12,277
This is your
journey, my friend.

330
00:20:12,309 --> 00:20:14,678
You must venture alone
into the unknown night

331
00:20:14,711 --> 00:20:17,816
with only brother
moon, sister sun,

332
00:20:17,848 --> 00:20:22,386
there can only be two
moccasins upon your path.

333
00:20:22,420 --> 00:20:24,256
Besides, somebody's
gotta stick around,

334
00:20:24,288 --> 00:20:26,490
make sure this ship
doesn't capsize.

335
00:20:26,523 --> 00:20:27,791
We really got something.

336
00:20:27,825 --> 00:20:29,427
We do, don't we?

337
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:31,596
So if you're gonna be on
the road and I'm stuck here,

338
00:20:31,628 --> 00:20:34,498
I'm thinking maybe we could
use an extra hand around here

339
00:20:34,531 --> 00:20:38,269
to help out at least with
the investment ideas.

340
00:20:38,303 --> 00:20:39,471
No, no.

341
00:20:39,503 --> 00:20:42,373
That's a lot of numbers
for this brain, man.

342
00:20:43,374 --> 00:20:44,276
One.

343
00:20:44,308 --> 00:20:45,042
All right maybe, maybe.

344
00:20:45,076 --> 00:20:47,746
Just one, one guy or gal, okay?

345
00:20:47,778 --> 00:20:48,946
One.

346
00:20:48,980 --> 00:20:49,881
One. That's all
I'm talkin' about.

347
00:20:49,913 --> 00:20:51,316
All right.

348
00:20:51,348 --> 00:20:54,019
I'll set up the
interviews this week.

349
00:20:54,051 --> 00:20:56,920
You know what, actually,
forget about the interviews.

350
00:20:56,953 --> 00:20:58,889
I got a better idea.

351
00:20:58,923 --> 00:20:59,990
That guy? That's
your better idea?

352
00:21:00,023 --> 00:21:02,559
Yeah, I had an intense
experience with this guy, man.

353
00:21:02,593 --> 00:21:03,694
I just, I got a good
feeling about him.

354
00:21:03,728 --> 00:21:06,564
That's a bona fide Scooby
Doo villain over there, man.

355
00:21:06,596 --> 00:21:07,598
Do you not trust me?

356
00:21:07,632 --> 00:21:08,365
This is reckless!

357
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:10,067
Jack, just trust
me on this one.

358
00:21:10,101 --> 00:21:12,671
I see something in this guy.

359
00:21:12,703 --> 00:21:14,638
It's called Hepatitis-C,
it's yellowing of the eyes...

360
00:21:14,672 --> 00:21:16,908
No, it's not Hepatitis.

361
00:21:16,941 --> 00:21:18,375
-Is it scabies?
-No scabies.

362
00:21:18,409 --> 00:21:19,611
No rabies.

363
00:21:19,644 --> 00:21:21,846
I see genuine goodness
in this guy, okay?

364
00:21:21,878 --> 00:21:23,380
Not but four weeks ago
there was a fine line

365
00:21:23,413 --> 00:21:24,615
between me and him.

366
00:21:24,648 --> 00:21:26,884
He deserves a second
chance, Jack, and,

367
00:21:26,917 --> 00:21:29,353
we're in a position
to give it to him.

368
00:21:30,587 --> 00:21:32,790
Can you just roll
with me on this?

369
00:21:32,824 --> 00:21:33,725
You ready?

370
00:21:34,892 --> 00:21:36,995
Jesus.

371
00:21:37,028 --> 00:21:38,563
Okay, I'll give you
the Scooby Doo villain.

372
00:21:38,596 --> 00:21:39,530
Thank you.

373
00:21:39,564 --> 00:21:41,800
Miles with the fountains.

374
00:21:41,833 --> 00:21:43,067
And the ride.

375
00:21:43,101 --> 00:21:44,469
You remember.

376
00:21:44,501 --> 00:21:49,073
Age has dulled my sense
of humor, young man.

377
00:21:49,106 --> 00:21:50,642
Not my memory.

378
00:21:50,674 --> 00:21:53,010
How did those lottery
tickets treat you?

379
00:21:53,044 --> 00:21:54,512
Got flipped off a lot.

380
00:21:55,579 --> 00:21:56,681
Thanks for the gesture.

381
00:21:56,713 --> 00:21:58,549
Anytime, here, I got...

382
00:21:58,583 --> 00:22:00,785
Nah, never twice.

383
00:22:00,817 --> 00:22:02,487
But you...

384
00:22:02,519 --> 00:22:04,489
Sir?

385
00:22:04,521 --> 00:22:06,423
Fresh out, sorry.

386
00:22:18,469 --> 00:22:21,807
A little something for
the night train fund.

387
00:22:23,941 --> 00:22:25,777
Durwood, do you enjoy this?

388
00:22:25,809 --> 00:22:30,115
I suppose you
mean my situation?

389
00:22:31,816 --> 00:22:33,384
Yeah.

390
00:22:33,984 --> 00:22:37,154
If you wanna see the best
and worst in people,

391
00:22:37,188 --> 00:22:39,591
just ask them to part

392
00:22:39,624 --> 00:22:42,126
with some of their
hard-earned cash.

393
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:43,495
I believe it's called begging.

394
00:22:43,528 --> 00:22:44,429
Asking.

395
00:22:44,461 --> 00:22:46,530
I didn't get your name.

396
00:22:46,564 --> 00:22:48,066
Jack, Durwood.

397
00:22:48,098 --> 00:22:50,467
Durwood, Jack.

398
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:51,668
Pardon Jack.

399
00:22:51,701 --> 00:22:53,872
So what brings you
gentlemen out here?

400
00:22:53,904 --> 00:22:56,875
Actually we wanted
to offer you a job.

401
00:22:58,075 --> 00:23:01,179
If you haven't
noticed, I'm retired.

402
00:23:02,946 --> 00:23:04,982
Why's that funny?

403
00:23:05,750 --> 00:23:08,553
Durwood, I can tell
you're an honest man.

404
00:23:08,586 --> 00:23:11,722
I don't think I
would work for anybody

405
00:23:11,756 --> 00:23:13,892
who would hire a stranger.

406
00:23:13,924 --> 00:23:16,961
Aren't all hirees
strangers at first?

407
00:23:16,993 --> 00:23:18,596
Yeah, but I
might be dangerous.

408
00:23:18,628 --> 00:23:20,598
But you're not
dangerous, are you?

409
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:24,134
No.

410
00:23:24,167 --> 00:23:25,569
All right.

411
00:23:25,603 --> 00:23:26,336
Well, you wouldn't
be working for us.

412
00:23:26,371 --> 00:23:28,640
You'd be working
with us, Durwood.

413
00:23:29,941 --> 00:23:33,778
And what would that line
of work be, if I might ask?

414
00:23:34,612 --> 00:23:36,915
Coins.

415
00:23:41,117 --> 00:23:43,620
Miles with the fountains.

416
00:23:43,653 --> 00:23:47,090
First you must
incorporate. We must.

417
00:23:47,124 --> 00:23:49,160
To be a legitimate
business you have to have

418
00:23:49,192 --> 00:23:51,996
a legitimate business. There's
gonna be a grey zone in state

419
00:23:52,028 --> 00:23:55,232
and federal taxes but I can
take care of that.

420
00:23:55,266 --> 00:23:58,102
I'll need you to get records
from every harvest site

421
00:23:58,134 --> 00:23:59,903
and receipts, I can't
stress it enough.

422
00:23:59,936 --> 00:24:01,805
You gotta keep every receipt.

423
00:24:01,838 --> 00:24:04,708
We'll start with some
high-interest CD accounts

424
00:24:04,741 --> 00:24:09,580
then we'll go long into fiber
optics, scratch-proof glass,

425
00:24:09,614 --> 00:24:13,218
real estate, maybe,
down the road.

426
00:24:13,250 --> 00:24:16,721
I predict we'll
milk 23 cents out of

427
00:24:16,753 --> 00:24:18,655
every penny you bring back.

428
00:24:18,689 --> 00:24:19,791
Well, I mean, that's...

429
00:24:23,861 --> 00:24:28,032
Can we change out this
city map for a state map?

430
00:24:28,065 --> 00:24:30,134
So we can follow
you on your trip.

431
00:24:30,166 --> 00:24:31,935
I'm sorry, is this going
a little fast for you?

432
00:24:31,969 --> 00:24:33,104
'Cause it is for me.

433
00:24:33,136 --> 00:24:34,705
I mean, we hardly know this guy.

434
00:24:34,739 --> 00:24:35,906
I don't know you.

435
00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:38,009
So I guess I have a
few questions like,

436
00:24:38,041 --> 00:24:39,276
I don't know, why you
smell like burritos,

437
00:24:39,309 --> 00:24:41,044
what's up with your hair?

438
00:24:41,077 --> 00:24:43,181
And if you're such a
brilliant businessman,

439
00:24:43,213 --> 00:24:45,049
how'd you become homeless?

440
00:24:47,117 --> 00:24:51,623
I ended up in the position
I find myself in today,

441
00:24:51,655 --> 00:24:55,659
after a series of decisions.

442
00:24:55,692 --> 00:24:59,263
Decisions with
which I am at peace.

443
00:25:01,265 --> 00:25:03,668
But I'm not homeless, young man.

444
00:25:07,305 --> 00:25:09,307
Can I crash here while
we get this thing going?

445
00:25:13,678 --> 00:25:14,812
Okay, brother.

446
00:25:14,845 --> 00:25:15,613
We're going all
the way with this.

447
00:25:15,645 --> 00:25:17,648
That's right, buddy.

448
00:25:17,682 --> 00:25:18,916
All right.

449
00:25:18,950 --> 00:25:21,052
All right, the receipts
and the release forms,

450
00:25:21,085 --> 00:25:22,754
and all the paperwork,
I'll make sure to have it

451
00:25:22,787 --> 00:25:25,856
and you just gotta keep Jack
in line and we'll be all right.

452
00:25:25,890 --> 00:25:27,992
Yeah.

453
00:25:28,025 --> 00:25:30,662
And I'll try to keep
Durwood out of the garbage.

454
00:25:30,694 --> 00:25:32,062
Drive safe.

455
00:25:32,096 --> 00:25:33,197
All right, that wasn't nice.

456
00:25:33,230 --> 00:25:34,699
That wasn't nice to say at all.

457
00:25:34,731 --> 00:25:36,768
I apologize for him.

458
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:40,637
But he'll come around and
he'll see what we see, okay?

459
00:25:40,671 --> 00:25:42,140
He's smart.

460
00:25:43,907 --> 00:25:45,709
I wouldn't have hired me either.

461
00:25:47,811 --> 00:25:50,080
Well Durwood,
I just trust you.

462
00:25:50,114 --> 00:25:52,717
Life's a lot easier that
way, you know what I mean?

463
00:25:52,750 --> 00:25:54,852
So you just do your thing,
and we'll have ourselves

464
00:25:54,884 --> 00:25:58,088
a legitimate business
on our hands, okay?

465
00:25:58,122 --> 00:25:59,190
You got it, boss.

466
00:25:59,222 --> 00:26:00,290
No, no.

467
00:26:00,324 --> 00:26:02,259
No boss, none of this...

468
00:26:02,292 --> 00:26:03,961
This, you know, this is...

469
00:26:03,994 --> 00:26:04,962
You know what I mean?

470
00:26:04,996 --> 00:26:06,163
No boss, no boss.

471
00:26:06,196 --> 00:26:07,598
I'll talk to you
later, all right?

472
00:26:08,798 --> 00:26:10,033
Here we go!

473
00:26:10,034 --> 00:26:11,336
We're doin' it!

474
00:26:29,686 --> 00:26:31,121
We need some

475
00:26:33,057 --> 00:26:34,692
better furniture.

476
00:26:50,106 --> 00:26:52,143
I'll get right
on that, Durwood.

477
00:27:02,686 --> 00:27:03,554
When?

478
00:28:14,491 --> 00:28:15,460
Hello.

479
00:28:16,493 --> 00:28:18,028
Hello yourself.

480
00:28:29,539 --> 00:28:32,409
Sorry, I didn't mean
to sneak up on you.

481
00:28:32,442 --> 00:28:34,445
I was just leaving.

482
00:28:52,896 --> 00:28:54,965
What'd you wish for?

483
00:28:56,534 --> 00:28:59,470
If I tell you, doesn't
it void the wish?

484
00:28:59,502 --> 00:29:01,472
No, actually.

485
00:29:02,873 --> 00:29:04,342
As soon as your
coin hits the water,

486
00:29:04,375 --> 00:29:07,511
it registers with the
wish distributors.

487
00:29:07,545 --> 00:29:08,346
Besides, you know, when
it comes to wishes,

488
00:29:08,378 --> 00:29:10,814
it's not the coin
that matters anyway.

489
00:29:20,990 --> 00:29:22,493
Are you superstitious?

490
00:29:24,461 --> 00:29:26,998
Yeah, yeah I've knocked
on my fair share of wood.

491
00:29:27,030 --> 00:29:30,067
Then would you mind
leaving mine in there?

492
00:29:30,099 --> 00:29:34,105
Just in case.

493
00:29:38,442 --> 00:29:39,911
Which one is it?

494
00:29:43,314 --> 00:29:43,980
It's that one.

495
00:29:44,013 --> 00:29:46,049
It's that one?

496
00:29:48,318 --> 00:29:51,221
You know what,
actually it's...

497
00:29:53,557 --> 00:29:54,290
Yeah.

498
00:29:54,325 --> 00:29:57,260
Yeah, it's my
lunchtime, actually.

499
00:29:59,128 --> 00:30:01,398
It's a really nice day out.

500
00:30:01,432 --> 00:30:04,969
You seem like equally
a nice person.

501
00:30:05,001 --> 00:30:06,403
Why don't you take a walk
with me around the park

502
00:30:06,436 --> 00:30:11,008
and I'll spare your
coin another day?

503
00:30:15,479 --> 00:30:16,480
Why not.

504
00:30:18,048 --> 00:30:19,416
Why not.

505
00:30:20,517 --> 00:30:21,820
All right.

506
00:30:23,319 --> 00:30:26,223
It must be nice to
work here every day.

507
00:30:27,557 --> 00:30:29,026
Plenty of fresh air...

508
00:30:30,259 --> 00:30:32,864
You get to watch the seasons
change right before you eyes.

509
00:30:32,896 --> 00:30:34,432
Yeah about that?

510
00:30:34,464 --> 00:30:37,934
I I don't mean
to mislead you

511
00:30:37,968 --> 00:30:40,337
but I don't work for the park.

512
00:30:40,371 --> 00:30:41,639
Who do you work for?

513
00:30:41,672 --> 00:30:43,140
Myself.

514
00:30:43,173 --> 00:30:44,474
-Yourself?
-Yeah.

515
00:30:44,508 --> 00:30:45,910
Then what is...

516
00:30:47,411 --> 00:30:49,013
What were you...

517
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:51,115
What?

518
00:30:51,147 --> 00:30:52,916
Just consider me
one of the world's

519
00:30:52,950 --> 00:30:54,885
most active coin collectors.

520
00:30:54,919 --> 00:30:57,221
-Come on.
-No, I'm serious.

521
00:30:57,253 --> 00:30:57,954
You're pulling my leg.

522
00:30:57,988 --> 00:30:59,457
No.

523
00:30:59,490 --> 00:31:00,391
Seriously?

524
00:31:00,423 --> 00:31:02,093
Seriously, seriously!

525
00:31:04,461 --> 00:31:07,064
So you make a living here?

526
00:31:07,096 --> 00:31:10,166
Yeah, well here,
there, you know.

527
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:11,501
Everywhere.

528
00:31:13,136 --> 00:31:15,105
That is crazy.

529
00:31:19,410 --> 00:31:21,211
So what were you before this?

530
00:31:21,244 --> 00:31:23,447
Miserable.

531
00:31:24,580 --> 00:31:26,917
And now?

532
00:31:26,951 --> 00:31:28,553
Making progress.

533
00:31:38,095 --> 00:31:39,596
All right what about you?

534
00:31:39,630 --> 00:31:42,466
What are you doing
out here on a,

535
00:31:42,499 --> 00:31:43,701
Tuesday?

536
00:31:43,733 --> 00:31:45,336
-Wednesday.
-Wednesday.

537
00:31:45,368 --> 00:31:46,303
Close.

538
00:31:48,471 --> 00:31:50,508
Well, besides the obvious?

539
00:31:51,275 --> 00:31:52,643
The fresh air.

540
00:31:52,675 --> 00:31:54,412
The sights.

541
00:31:57,548 --> 00:31:59,717
I used to come here
when I was a kid.

542
00:31:59,750 --> 00:32:01,551
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

543
00:32:02,385 --> 00:32:05,522
But now I'm just, you
know, passing through.

544
00:32:08,192 --> 00:32:10,060
Travelling the state.

545
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:12,495
A vacation, sort of.

546
00:32:12,528 --> 00:32:13,297
Okay.

547
00:32:13,329 --> 00:32:15,398
Getting off the
grid for a while.

548
00:32:15,432 --> 00:32:18,602
The grid?

549
00:32:18,634 --> 00:32:20,671
So what about you?

550
00:32:20,703 --> 00:32:23,674
Where do your roots end?

551
00:32:24,674 --> 00:32:26,242
The grid.

552
00:32:27,478 --> 00:32:29,212
Where are you goin'?

553
00:32:29,246 --> 00:32:30,715
Well that's...

554
00:32:30,748 --> 00:32:34,585
That is a good
question, isn't it?

555
00:32:39,256 --> 00:32:40,291
Well wait.

556
00:32:40,324 --> 00:32:41,392
Wait.

557
00:32:41,424 --> 00:32:45,328
If I'm gonna take anything
away from this conversation,

558
00:32:45,362 --> 00:32:46,998
let it be your name.

559
00:32:49,199 --> 00:32:50,468
Penelope.

560
00:32:51,567 --> 00:32:54,238
Miles.

561
00:32:58,474 --> 00:33:00,443
As in, like...

562
00:33:00,477 --> 00:33:01,479
No.

563
00:33:01,511 --> 00:33:03,114
As in Ellie, not Penny.

564
00:33:03,146 --> 00:33:04,514
God, wouldn't that be something.

565
00:33:04,548 --> 00:33:05,516
Yeah, it would.

566
00:33:07,317 --> 00:33:08,251
All right.

567
00:33:08,285 --> 00:33:09,452
Okay.

568
00:33:09,486 --> 00:33:13,124
Well, did you...

569
00:33:13,156 --> 00:33:15,225
Quarter, dime, nickel?

570
00:33:15,259 --> 00:33:15,659
Your wish.

571
00:33:15,692 --> 00:33:17,528
Penny.

572
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:18,428
Of course.

573
00:33:20,463 --> 00:33:21,598
All right well I'm gonna
be here until about

574
00:33:21,632 --> 00:33:24,567
midnight tonight so I'm gonna
leave all the pennies there

575
00:33:24,601 --> 00:33:27,705
until then and that guarantees
that your wish is heard

576
00:33:27,738 --> 00:33:29,606
and you know, at
the end of the night

577
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:32,710
I'll have to go in and
swoop 'em all up but,

578
00:33:32,742 --> 00:33:34,744
all will be well.

579
00:33:34,778 --> 00:33:35,578
Okay.

580
00:33:35,612 --> 00:33:37,115
Okay.

581
00:33:39,583 --> 00:33:42,220
Are you gonna be here tomorrow?

582
00:33:43,554 --> 00:33:45,189
I am on vacation.

583
00:33:45,823 --> 00:33:47,492
You never know.

584
00:33:49,358 --> 00:33:50,494
All right.

585
00:33:53,463 --> 00:33:55,298
What'd you wish for?

586
00:33:56,599 --> 00:33:58,735
What we're all wishing for.

587
00:34:05,576 --> 00:34:06,777
What are you doing right now?

588
00:34:06,809 --> 00:34:08,179
Checking the internet.

589
00:34:08,211 --> 00:34:10,748
Making sure you're
not gonna murder me.

590
00:34:10,780 --> 00:34:12,083
What's your last name?

591
00:34:12,115 --> 00:34:13,717
I need you to get
these notarized.

592
00:34:13,750 --> 00:34:16,554
I gotta check out
fountain progress.

593
00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:23,427
Miles, what's up!

594
00:34:23,460 --> 00:34:24,662
Hey, buddy.

595
00:34:24,695 --> 00:34:26,497
One week without
our fearless leader.

596
00:34:26,530 --> 00:34:27,431
Good news on your end?

597
00:34:27,465 --> 00:34:29,266
If things keep going
the way they're going,

598
00:34:29,298 --> 00:34:32,168
we're gonna retire by the
end of next year, brother.

599
00:34:32,202 --> 00:34:33,637
You guys should be receiving
some packages from me

600
00:34:33,670 --> 00:34:34,872
by the end of the week, okay?

601
00:34:34,905 --> 00:34:38,476
And I am currently
one day behind.

602
00:34:38,509 --> 00:34:40,110
All right. Everything okay?

603
00:34:40,143 --> 00:34:42,346
I'm just gonna spend the
night here in zone seven

604
00:34:42,378 --> 00:34:43,746
and then I'll make
everything up tomorrow.

605
00:34:43,780 --> 00:34:46,750
Remember, you're
on CEO time now, buddy

606
00:34:46,782 --> 00:34:48,451
so just pace yourself.

607
00:34:48,485 --> 00:34:49,420
You pace yourself.

608
00:34:49,452 --> 00:34:51,422
Listen, didn't mean
to mention it but I got

609
00:34:51,454 --> 00:34:52,590
some ideas I wanna run by you.

610
00:34:52,623 --> 00:34:53,724
I can't wait to hear 'em!

611
00:34:53,757 --> 00:34:56,526
You wanna just give 'em to
me in detail when I get back?

612
00:34:56,559 --> 00:34:57,795
Sure sure.

613
00:34:57,827 --> 00:34:59,496
Happy treasuring, my friend.

614
00:34:59,530 --> 00:35:03,801
Talk to you soon.

615
00:35:08,639 --> 00:35:09,874
So?

616
00:35:09,907 --> 00:35:11,575
So what?

617
00:35:11,608 --> 00:35:13,344
So, how's he doing?

618
00:35:13,376 --> 00:35:15,445
Well, Miles is
doing well, Durwood.

619
00:35:15,478 --> 00:35:18,781
Thank you for asking, I
appreciate your concern.

620
00:35:18,815 --> 00:35:20,317
Do you have a problem?

621
00:35:20,349 --> 00:35:21,451
Yeah.

622
00:35:21,485 --> 00:35:23,487
Matter of fact.

623
00:35:23,519 --> 00:35:26,456
Just because you know your
way around the legal landscape

624
00:35:26,489 --> 00:35:28,424
doesn't mean we're friends.

625
00:35:28,458 --> 00:35:29,793
Damn sure doesn't
mean I trust you.

626
00:35:29,826 --> 00:35:31,161
Miles does.

627
00:35:31,195 --> 00:35:33,231
Miles isn't right
about everything.

628
00:35:34,697 --> 00:35:36,466
You trust him?

629
00:35:38,402 --> 00:35:39,403
Yes I do.

630
00:35:39,436 --> 00:35:41,838
Then give me a chance.

631
00:35:41,871 --> 00:35:43,373
I'm here to help.

632
00:35:43,407 --> 00:35:47,211
Have some fun in the process.

633
00:35:47,244 --> 00:35:48,846
I don't need to be here.

634
00:35:48,878 --> 00:35:50,514
What, are you gonna
go back to your job

635
00:35:50,547 --> 00:35:53,184
haunting the
abandoned mineshaft?

636
00:35:54,518 --> 00:35:56,487
Maybe.

637
00:36:00,523 --> 00:36:03,728
I have some ideas, on R&D.

638
00:36:04,728 --> 00:36:07,764
Think we can make Miles'
life a little bit easier.

639
00:36:07,797 --> 00:36:11,234
We'd have to hire somebody
though, freelance, of course.

640
00:36:11,268 --> 00:36:12,570
Can you get on board?

641
00:36:12,603 --> 00:36:15,840
We all agreed not
to hire anybody.

642
00:36:18,976 --> 00:36:21,612
But I'll trust you.

643
00:36:21,644 --> 00:36:25,715
We'll break it to Miles later.

644
00:36:49,639 --> 00:36:51,775
I'm sorry!

645
00:36:51,807 --> 00:36:53,876
I'm sorry, are you okay?

646
00:36:53,909 --> 00:36:54,877
Yeah?

647
00:36:56,346 --> 00:36:59,282
-Here.
-Yeah.

648
00:37:01,518 --> 00:37:02,952
You got me good!

649
00:37:02,985 --> 00:37:05,655
You know, I was hoping to run
into you, I just, you know,

650
00:37:05,688 --> 00:37:06,824
not quite...

651
00:37:06,856 --> 00:37:08,559
Like that.

652
00:37:08,592 --> 00:37:10,394
You almost missed me.

653
00:37:10,427 --> 00:37:11,795
I was just packing up.

654
00:37:11,827 --> 00:37:12,929
Really?

655
00:37:14,431 --> 00:37:16,266
Where were you headed?

656
00:37:18,768 --> 00:37:22,272
Just looking to put some asphalt
between me and my problems.

657
00:37:22,306 --> 00:37:23,740
I see.

658
00:37:23,773 --> 00:37:25,409
Well...

659
00:37:27,443 --> 00:37:32,650
They're never quite as bad
as they seem to be?

660
00:37:36,619 --> 00:37:40,423
All right, this may
seem absolutely bonkers

661
00:37:40,456 --> 00:37:42,525
since we're pretty
much strangers...

662
00:37:42,559 --> 00:37:44,295
Well isn't everybody?

663
00:37:44,327 --> 00:37:46,463
Yeah, at first, right?

664
00:37:50,500 --> 00:37:52,302
Why don't you ride with me?

665
00:37:53,903 --> 00:37:55,373
What?

666
00:37:56,373 --> 00:37:58,608
I mean, there's plenty
of fresh air out there.

667
00:37:58,641 --> 00:37:59,909
You know, if you're
looking for change,

668
00:37:59,943 --> 00:38:01,845
you just gotta know
where to find it.

669
00:38:01,878 --> 00:38:03,646
It makes sense.

670
00:38:03,679 --> 00:38:05,748
To coin a phrase.

671
00:38:05,782 --> 00:38:08,586
Hurry fast or I'm about
to turn on a dime.

672
00:38:09,853 --> 00:38:10,921
I'll keep 'em coming.

673
00:38:12,489 --> 00:38:14,525
Quarter.

674
00:38:17,059 --> 00:38:19,329
You do have my coin, right?

675
00:38:19,362 --> 00:38:20,563
I do.

676
00:38:21,597 --> 00:38:23,701
So I guess that
makes me a shareholder.

677
00:38:23,733 --> 00:38:24,835
It does.

678
00:38:24,867 --> 00:38:27,503
I guess I could ride along and

679
00:38:27,536 --> 00:38:29,072
keep tabs on my investment.

680
00:38:29,106 --> 00:38:30,808
Yeah?

681
00:38:32,943 --> 00:38:34,345
Okay!

682
00:38:34,378 --> 00:38:36,713
You better be a
normal dude, though.

683
00:38:36,746 --> 00:38:39,482
I'm just a dude bein'
normal in a light-blue onesie!

684
00:38:39,516 --> 00:38:41,485
Out in public!

685
00:38:41,518 --> 00:38:43,454
All right, where to?

686
00:38:50,527 --> 00:38:51,494
You wanna pick
on the other side.

687
00:38:51,527 --> 00:38:52,862
It's not going through, okay.

688
00:38:52,896 --> 00:38:54,932
Okay, you wanna, okay...

689
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:57,434
Think
you'd fit in here?

690
00:38:57,467 --> 00:38:58,469
Yep.

691
00:39:18,688 --> 00:39:20,523
I need this job so I
can pay off people.

692
00:39:20,556 --> 00:39:22,592
They won't be coming
here though, I promise.

693
00:39:22,626 --> 00:39:24,495
I trust you.

694
00:40:33,896 --> 00:40:37,201
You know, that fancy phone
has a fancy map on there too.

695
00:40:37,233 --> 00:40:39,635
But, this is a treasure map.

696
00:40:39,668 --> 00:40:40,871
Okay?

697
00:40:40,903 --> 00:40:42,172
You don't do that
on a treasure map.

698
00:40:42,204 --> 00:40:43,940
You gotta lay it out, like this.

699
00:40:43,974 --> 00:40:45,709
Then you trace it.

700
00:40:45,742 --> 00:40:47,144
Okay.

701
00:40:47,177 --> 00:40:53,584
I'm gonna go load up
on some junk food.

702
00:40:57,887 --> 00:40:58,688
All right.

703
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:04,661
Hello!

704
00:41:04,693 --> 00:41:06,163
Hey, partner.

705
00:41:06,195 --> 00:41:08,565
Keep up the good work, man,
we're rollin' in dough here.

706
00:41:08,597 --> 00:41:10,601
It's gonna get deeper
because we are actually

707
00:41:10,634 --> 00:41:11,835
ahead of schedule now.

708
00:41:11,867 --> 00:41:12,568
Really?

709
00:41:12,601 --> 00:41:13,536
Yeah.

710
00:41:13,570 --> 00:41:15,806
Jack listen.

711
00:41:15,838 --> 00:41:18,942
I I have to
tell you something.

712
00:41:20,876 --> 00:41:22,679
I hired someone.

713
00:41:27,583 --> 00:41:28,751
Who is he?

714
00:41:28,784 --> 00:41:31,687
He is a she and
her name is Penelope.

715
00:41:31,721 --> 00:41:34,157
Penelope? Woohoohoohoo!

716
00:41:34,190 --> 00:41:36,559
I I met her at
zone number seven,

717
00:41:36,592 --> 00:41:38,728
and yeah.

718
00:41:38,762 --> 00:41:40,898
All right I'm not gonna
give you too much hell,

719
00:41:40,931 --> 00:41:43,634
just tell me this,
is she worth it?

720
00:41:43,666 --> 00:41:45,302
Wahoo!

721
00:41:48,605 --> 00:41:52,208
I do believe so.

722
00:41:52,242 --> 00:41:53,310
Okay.

723
00:41:53,342 --> 00:41:54,911
All right then.

724
00:41:54,945 --> 00:41:56,179
You're taking this a
hell of a lot better than I

725
00:41:56,211 --> 00:41:58,681
thought you would.

726
00:41:58,715 --> 00:42:00,117
Do you trust me, Miles?

727
00:42:00,150 --> 00:42:01,918
Of course I trust you.

728
00:42:01,952 --> 00:42:02,986
The feeling is mutual.

729
00:42:03,018 --> 00:42:04,620
I'm sure you had good reasons.

730
00:42:04,653 --> 00:42:07,090
Yeah, I had very good reasons.

731
00:42:07,123 --> 00:42:08,625
But she's the last one.

732
00:42:08,657 --> 00:42:09,893
No más.

733
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:11,662
Cool cool.

734
00:42:11,695 --> 00:42:13,931
Well, I gotta get back to it.

735
00:42:13,963 --> 00:42:15,965
Got a big surprise waiting
for you when you get back.

736
00:42:15,998 --> 00:42:17,099
Okay, cool.

737
00:42:17,132 --> 00:42:20,903
Well you tell
Durwood I said hello.

738
00:42:20,936 --> 00:42:22,906
All right, sounds good.

739
00:42:24,306 --> 00:42:26,142
That was our fearless leader.

740
00:42:33,382 --> 00:42:35,118
What are you running from?

741
00:42:37,219 --> 00:42:39,756
I'm not running.

742
00:42:44,059 --> 00:42:46,028
I'm just keeping pace.

743
00:42:46,061 --> 00:42:48,097
Okay.

744
00:42:48,130 --> 00:42:49,899
It's a long story.

745
00:42:52,068 --> 00:42:54,772
No actually, it's
not a long story.

746
00:42:55,405 --> 00:42:58,609
I just, I don't want
you to think less of me.

747
00:43:01,978 --> 00:43:04,648
That's impossible, I can
never think less of you.

748
00:43:12,222 --> 00:43:14,725
Someone very close
to me is sick.

749
00:43:15,791 --> 00:43:17,795
She has been for a while.

750
00:43:19,663 --> 00:43:23,233
And I, took a
risk to do something.

751
00:43:24,199 --> 00:43:25,902
I got carried away.

752
00:43:27,903 --> 00:43:30,407
Well, sounds like you
were just trying to do

753
00:43:30,440 --> 00:43:32,175
the right thing.

754
00:43:32,208 --> 00:43:35,378
There's nothing wrong with that.

755
00:44:37,474 --> 00:44:38,242
Right.

756
00:44:38,275 --> 00:44:41,010
Checks and sandwich
time, gentlemen.

757
00:44:41,043 --> 00:44:42,211
Here you go, Lawrence.

758
00:44:53,422 --> 00:44:54,757
All right,
enjoy, fellas.

759
00:45:04,434 --> 00:45:07,403
That was the best
barbecue I've ever had.

760
00:45:08,304 --> 00:45:09,405
Seriously.

761
00:45:09,438 --> 00:45:10,773
What's in the sauce?

762
00:45:10,806 --> 00:45:12,742
Old family secret.

763
00:45:12,775 --> 00:45:14,443
You got a lot of
secrets, Durwood.

764
00:45:15,478 --> 00:45:18,315
How do you know so much?

765
00:45:18,347 --> 00:45:19,449
It's just sauce.

766
00:45:19,481 --> 00:45:21,418
No, about everything.

767
00:45:21,451 --> 00:45:25,822
About barbecue, about
obscure taxation laws.

768
00:45:25,855 --> 00:45:27,858
Life.

769
00:45:27,891 --> 00:45:29,358
I've lived a lot of it.

770
00:45:29,391 --> 00:45:30,493
Yeah.

771
00:45:30,527 --> 00:45:32,028
Worn a lot of hats.

772
00:45:32,061 --> 00:45:35,231
I never would have given
you the time of day unless

773
00:45:35,264 --> 00:45:37,400
Miles had insisted.

774
00:45:37,432 --> 00:45:40,771
He's always had a
certain intuition

775
00:45:40,804 --> 00:45:43,106
that I just don't.

776
00:45:43,139 --> 00:45:46,009
Can't teach intuition, can you?

777
00:45:46,041 --> 00:45:47,409
He's a born leader.

778
00:45:47,443 --> 00:45:49,813
Doesn't even know it.

779
00:45:49,846 --> 00:45:53,349
Don't compare your goodness

780
00:45:53,382 --> 00:45:56,352
by the prism of somebody else.

781
00:45:56,385 --> 00:45:59,456
You're doing all right by him.

782
00:45:59,489 --> 00:46:01,925
What do you want out
of all this, Durwood?

783
00:46:01,958 --> 00:46:04,027
I mean, besides the obvious.

784
00:46:04,059 --> 00:46:08,965
One thing I want, is for a
certain smart young individual

785
00:46:08,998 --> 00:46:13,003
to forgo the assumptions
accompanying a man's clothes.

786
00:46:13,036 --> 00:46:15,005
A mistake I've
made once or twice.

787
00:46:15,038 --> 00:46:19,108
Then, well I might die happy.

788
00:46:19,141 --> 00:46:22,278
Which will probably be the
case when Miles gets back.

789
00:46:22,311 --> 00:46:24,914
He's gonna kill us when he
sees we've hired a full staff.

790
00:46:45,235 --> 00:46:47,003
Doesn't it cost a
lot to send these back?

791
00:46:47,036 --> 00:46:49,405
No it's like
pennies on the dollar.

792
00:46:49,438 --> 00:46:51,507
Besides, when these little
piggies are at guard,

793
00:46:51,541 --> 00:46:53,410
it keeps "the powers that be"
from interfering.

794
00:46:53,443 --> 00:46:55,412
So they're like sentinels.

795
00:46:55,445 --> 00:46:56,313
Yeah.

796
00:46:56,346 --> 00:46:58,181
Exactly.

797
00:46:58,213 --> 00:47:00,382
You know, I used to have
one of these when I was a kid.

798
00:47:00,416 --> 00:47:03,119
I filled it with chewing gum
and baseball cards though.

799
00:47:03,152 --> 00:47:05,387
A pretty girl
with baseball cards.

800
00:47:05,420 --> 00:47:07,890
You are so adorable.

801
00:47:09,125 --> 00:47:12,295
Gosh that seems
so far away now.

802
00:47:15,030 --> 00:47:18,367
Why don't we, you
know, go see your folks?

803
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:21,036
You said they're
close by, right?

804
00:47:21,070 --> 00:47:22,539
I don't think
that's such a good idea.

805
00:47:22,572 --> 00:47:23,874
No? Okay.

806
00:47:23,907 --> 00:47:25,508
Right.

807
00:47:25,541 --> 00:47:26,443
Cool.

808
00:47:30,213 --> 00:47:32,282
We can't stay long though.

809
00:47:33,983 --> 00:47:35,853
Okay.

810
00:47:37,320 --> 00:47:38,455
Let's do it.

811
00:47:51,166 --> 00:47:52,434
It's okay.

812
00:47:52,467 --> 00:47:53,969
Could you
just give me a second?

813
00:47:54,003 --> 00:47:55,672
Okay, no problem.

814
00:47:55,704 --> 00:47:57,539
Okay.

815
00:48:25,101 --> 00:48:28,572
Okay?

816
00:48:37,347 --> 00:48:39,049
You have a
responsibility that you

817
00:48:39,081 --> 00:48:41,250
haven't taken care of!
No, Dad!

818
00:48:41,284 --> 00:48:42,318
You know why I did it!

819
00:48:42,351 --> 00:48:44,119
You know exactly why I did that!

820
00:48:44,152 --> 00:48:46,121
Right, but now it's
time to take care of it!

821
00:48:48,992 --> 00:48:50,593
Don't
you start with that!

822
00:48:53,628 --> 00:48:55,097
You must be Miles.

823
00:48:55,130 --> 00:48:56,298
Mrs. Norris.

824
00:48:56,331 --> 00:48:58,467
Sorry I just let
myself in like that.

825
00:48:58,501 --> 00:48:59,569
Don't be silly.

826
00:48:59,601 --> 00:49:01,570
I've heard so much
about you from

827
00:49:01,603 --> 00:49:03,439
Penelope's post cards.

828
00:49:03,472 --> 00:49:06,543
You know, she doesn't
get to call home

829
00:49:06,576 --> 00:49:08,344
that much anymore.

830
00:49:08,378 --> 00:49:10,113
Would you mind helping
me in the kitchen?

831
00:49:10,146 --> 00:49:11,348
Yeah, I'd love to.

832
00:49:11,380 --> 00:49:12,648
-Okay.
-Yes, yes.

833
00:49:18,621 --> 00:49:20,155
Mom, are you okay?

834
00:49:23,592 --> 00:49:25,728
I understand you're
a business owner.

835
00:49:25,762 --> 00:49:27,130
How exciting.

836
00:49:27,163 --> 00:49:28,630
He doesn't want
to talk about that.

837
00:49:28,664 --> 00:49:32,035
Well, why don't we just let
Miles be the judge of that?

838
00:49:33,302 --> 00:49:34,403
Yes, ma'am, I am.

839
00:49:34,436 --> 00:49:35,337
I...

840
00:49:35,371 --> 00:49:36,271
What kind of business is it?

841
00:49:36,304 --> 00:49:37,272
That's a good question.

842
00:49:38,273 --> 00:49:39,775
He's a collector.

843
00:49:39,809 --> 00:49:41,144
Professional collector.

844
00:49:41,177 --> 00:49:42,512
And he's been nice
enough to give me a job.

845
00:49:43,445 --> 00:49:44,614
I see.

846
00:49:44,646 --> 00:49:48,518
So, antiques or cars, or...

847
00:49:48,550 --> 00:49:50,119
Coins.

848
00:49:51,454 --> 00:49:53,722
Okay!

849
00:49:53,755 --> 00:49:55,290
That's very neat, Miles.

850
00:49:56,425 --> 00:49:57,693
Yeah.

851
00:49:57,726 --> 00:50:01,163
You've raised a
wonderful daughter.

852
00:50:03,099 --> 00:50:05,434
A business owner and a
good judge of character.

853
00:50:07,369 --> 00:50:09,438
We've really grown up with her.

854
00:50:09,472 --> 00:50:10,607
We miss her.

855
00:50:12,208 --> 00:50:14,543
I'm sure you'll
understand some day,

856
00:50:14,577 --> 00:50:16,246
that is if you have children.

857
00:50:18,481 --> 00:50:19,582
Yeah, yeah obviously.

858
00:50:19,614 --> 00:50:20,582
Yes, yeah.

859
00:50:20,615 --> 00:50:23,286
Yeah, kids.

860
00:50:30,159 --> 00:50:32,195
We've just been talking.

861
00:50:32,228 --> 00:50:35,498
Miles here has been kind
enough to give Penelope a job.

862
00:50:35,530 --> 00:50:37,400
Is that so?

863
00:50:37,432 --> 00:50:40,603
What line of work
are you in, Miles?

864
00:50:40,635 --> 00:50:41,771
He collects coins.

865
00:50:41,804 --> 00:50:43,273
Isn't that fascinating?

866
00:50:43,306 --> 00:50:45,541
And you turn profit, do you?

867
00:50:45,574 --> 00:50:47,342
You'd be surprised, sir.

868
00:50:47,376 --> 00:50:49,246
How old are you, Miles?

869
00:50:51,614 --> 00:50:53,349
I'm...

870
00:50:53,382 --> 00:50:55,518
35.

871
00:50:55,550 --> 00:50:57,686
I'm willing to give
the benefit of the doubt

872
00:50:57,719 --> 00:51:00,756
to anyone who's 35
and still says sir.

873
00:51:03,492 --> 00:51:04,626
Who wants dessert?

874
00:51:04,659 --> 00:51:06,328
Yeah.

875
00:51:06,362 --> 00:51:09,331
First, we gotta talk.

876
00:51:11,300 --> 00:51:12,735
Miles, you seem to be
an impressive young man,

877
00:51:12,768 --> 00:51:16,172
I trust you won't be offended
if I ask you to wait outside.

878
00:51:16,204 --> 00:51:18,141
No, he stays.

879
00:51:18,173 --> 00:51:19,608
He can hear whatever
you have to say.

880
00:51:19,641 --> 00:51:20,609
It's okay, it's
okay, really, I...

881
00:51:20,643 --> 00:51:22,244
No.

882
00:51:25,614 --> 00:51:27,083
Very well.

883
00:51:28,550 --> 00:51:31,221
Will you give this
to Penelope, please?

884
00:51:32,387 --> 00:51:34,290
Okay, all right.

885
00:51:35,291 --> 00:51:37,626
Now that's $500.

886
00:51:37,659 --> 00:51:40,562
And I want you to take it,
regardless of what comes next.

887
00:51:40,596 --> 00:51:42,197
Dad, I told you, I have a job.

888
00:51:42,231 --> 00:51:44,267
I have an income now.

889
00:51:44,300 --> 00:51:45,268
I'm gonna set this all straight.

890
00:51:45,300 --> 00:51:47,436
I'm gonna dial this number.

891
00:51:47,469 --> 00:51:50,372
This is a good man, and he
tells me that he's gonna do

892
00:51:50,405 --> 00:51:53,610
everything in his power
to try to help you out.

893
00:51:54,744 --> 00:51:56,512
Stop it.

894
00:51:56,545 --> 00:51:57,846
She's not a criminal.

895
00:51:57,880 --> 00:51:59,782
We've all made mistakes.

896
00:52:01,317 --> 00:52:04,554
Why are you doing this, Dad?

897
00:52:04,586 --> 00:52:06,688
'Cause you have to face this,

898
00:52:06,722 --> 00:52:10,193
so we can get past this
and become a family again.

899
00:52:12,195 --> 00:52:13,496
Again?

900
00:52:13,528 --> 00:52:14,864
I love you with all my heart,

901
00:52:14,896 --> 00:52:16,431
but that's why I
have to do this.

902
00:52:16,465 --> 00:52:18,401
The law is the law, Penelope.

903
00:52:18,434 --> 00:52:20,503
I can't stop you from
walking out that door,

904
00:52:20,536 --> 00:52:24,474
but please, don't disappoint
me anymore, sweetie.

905
00:52:26,409 --> 00:52:29,878
So, would we like to have
banana pudding or shortcake?

906
00:52:29,911 --> 00:52:32,481
You cannot keep
running from consequence.

907
00:52:32,514 --> 00:52:34,516
If you liked the meatloaf,
Miles, I think you would

908
00:52:34,550 --> 00:52:35,785
like the banana pudding.

909
00:52:35,818 --> 00:52:37,487
We shouldn't have come.

910
00:52:37,519 --> 00:52:39,556
Dad, don't do this!

911
00:52:40,889 --> 00:52:42,558
I gotta go, I gotta go.

912
00:52:47,362 --> 00:52:48,263
I love you.

913
00:52:48,297 --> 00:52:51,501
I love you too.

914
00:52:51,534 --> 00:52:52,367
Great meatloaf.

915
00:52:52,400 --> 00:52:54,203
Thank you, Miles.

916
00:52:55,503 --> 00:52:56,739
Goodbye, Penelope.

917
00:52:58,541 --> 00:52:59,776
Okay.

918
00:52:59,809 --> 00:53:01,811
I'll just wiggle on
out of here.

919
00:53:06,514 --> 00:53:07,616
You okay?

920
00:53:07,650 --> 00:53:08,785
Let's go.

921
00:53:41,349 --> 00:53:43,219
Penelope...

922
00:53:46,521 --> 00:53:49,458
I want you know that
you don't ever have to

923
00:53:49,492 --> 00:53:52,394
feel like you have to
talk about that, okay?

924
00:53:55,530 --> 00:53:57,534
I'm in a lot of
trouble, Miles.

925
00:53:59,068 --> 00:54:00,971
Okay?

926
00:54:04,806 --> 00:54:08,277
What kind of trouble
are we talking about?

927
00:54:12,614 --> 00:54:14,549
The money kind.

928
00:54:14,583 --> 00:54:16,786
Where I might have to
go away for a while.

929
00:54:18,521 --> 00:54:19,856
You'd believe me if I
told you I was just trying

930
00:54:19,889 --> 00:54:21,291
to do the right thing, right?

931
00:54:21,324 --> 00:54:22,557
Because I was.
Absolutely.

932
00:54:22,590 --> 00:54:23,759
I know you were trying
to do the right thing.

933
00:54:23,793 --> 00:54:25,394
I know that.

934
00:54:25,427 --> 00:54:26,962
They mean everything to
me and I can't imagine life

935
00:54:26,996 --> 00:54:29,932
without them and when
my mom got sick, I...

936
00:54:32,601 --> 00:54:34,671
I'm trouble.

937
00:54:36,405 --> 00:54:40,477
I bet I'm a lot
more trouble than you.

938
00:54:44,380 --> 00:54:46,516
I'll be there with you
and we will find a way.

939
00:54:46,548 --> 00:54:47,851
Okay?

940
00:54:54,690 --> 00:54:58,628
All right...

941
00:55:02,530 --> 00:55:04,800
You can start by getting
a good night's rest.

942
00:55:04,833 --> 00:55:06,302
Yeah.

943
00:55:10,106 --> 00:55:13,310
It's gonna be okay.

944
00:57:08,791 --> 00:57:09,692
Ellie! It's me.

945
00:57:09,724 --> 00:57:12,761
It's the fella next door.

946
00:57:12,795 --> 00:57:16,465
Last night was great,
it was special.

947
00:57:16,498 --> 00:57:17,966
Especially...

948
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:19,601
Especially great!

949
00:57:19,635 --> 00:57:22,972
I don't wanna compromise this...

950
00:57:23,005 --> 00:57:24,173
Us.

951
00:57:24,206 --> 00:57:28,544
I know I'm not exactly Johnny
Poetry Pants out here but

952
00:57:28,577 --> 00:57:30,613
I made you somethin'!

953
00:57:32,715 --> 00:57:34,650
I bet you're tired, you know?

954
00:57:34,682 --> 00:57:36,952
'Cause I know I am.

955
00:57:36,985 --> 00:57:39,788
And that's not me braggin'
or nothin', that's just,

956
00:57:39,822 --> 00:57:41,557
you know, it's, can we talk?

957
00:57:44,592 --> 00:57:47,096
Are
you Penelope Norris?

958
00:57:47,128 --> 00:57:48,498
No...

959
00:57:48,530 --> 00:57:50,967
Then
please step aside.

960
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:53,068
You step aside.

961
00:57:53,101 --> 00:57:55,971
Let me see some
identification, son.

962
00:57:56,005 --> 00:57:58,740
Can you tell me what you do
for a living, Mr. McCray?

963
00:57:58,773 --> 00:57:59,976
Yeah.

964
00:58:00,976 --> 00:58:02,244
What do you do for a living?

965
00:58:02,277 --> 00:58:03,712
I work.

966
00:58:04,679 --> 00:58:06,581
Nothin'.

967
00:58:06,614 --> 00:58:08,049
All right.

968
00:58:08,083 --> 00:58:09,885
Hey, can I ask
what's going on here?

969
00:58:09,918 --> 00:58:11,686
No, you may not.

970
00:58:11,719 --> 00:58:14,689
You gonna tell me where
Penelope's headed?

971
00:58:14,722 --> 00:58:18,594
I have no idea.

972
00:58:20,862 --> 00:58:22,764
Say that again.

973
00:58:23,965 --> 00:58:28,103
I have no idea.

974
00:58:32,041 --> 00:58:33,610
It's your lucky day.

975
00:58:34,242 --> 00:58:35,844
We believe you.

976
00:58:37,346 --> 00:58:39,215
We're done here, Kyle.

977
00:58:42,717 --> 00:58:44,219
Have a nice day.

978
00:58:45,721 --> 00:58:48,623
Hey,
you can't take those soaps.

979
00:58:48,657 --> 00:58:50,026
Evidence.

980
00:58:55,731 --> 00:58:57,967
Tell me the meaning
of life, Durwood.

981
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:01,003
Now is as good a time as any.

982
00:59:01,036 --> 00:59:03,739
Well I had it years ago, but,

983
00:59:03,771 --> 00:59:06,675
then I left it on the roof
of my car at a gas station

984
00:59:06,708 --> 00:59:09,044
and drove off.

985
00:59:09,077 --> 00:59:11,614
Something she
said stuck with me.

986
00:59:11,646 --> 00:59:15,050
Said we were thieving wishes.

987
00:59:15,083 --> 00:59:16,786
I don't know about that.

988
00:59:16,818 --> 00:59:18,653
Coins are just the vessels.

989
00:59:18,686 --> 00:59:21,623
Let's just make sure we
put them to good use.

990
00:59:23,726 --> 00:59:26,662
So how are you and
Jack getting along?

991
00:59:26,695 --> 00:59:28,597
He's a good manager.

992
00:59:28,630 --> 00:59:30,266
And a good man.

993
00:59:31,634 --> 00:59:33,369
We got ourselves quite an
empire on our hands here,

994
00:59:33,402 --> 00:59:35,304
Durwood.

995
00:59:35,336 --> 00:59:36,338
Hey!

996
00:59:36,371 --> 00:59:38,306
It's a shooting star!

997
00:59:38,340 --> 00:59:40,076
Two sips.

998
00:59:40,108 --> 00:59:41,344
Cheers.

999
00:59:41,376 --> 00:59:43,112
Cheers.

1000
00:59:47,148 --> 00:59:48,851
You will find her.

1001
00:59:52,320 --> 00:59:55,924
All right well thanks for
yappin' with me, Durwood.

1002
00:59:55,958 --> 00:59:59,028
Next time why don't we talk
about your love life, all right?

1003
00:59:59,061 --> 01:00:00,229
It's only fair.

1004
01:00:00,262 --> 01:00:02,097
Yeah, I'll tell you about the

1005
01:00:02,130 --> 01:00:05,166
12 loves of my life.

1006
01:00:05,199 --> 01:00:07,135
Deal.

1007
01:00:07,168 --> 01:00:11,807
Take care.

1008
01:01:31,753 --> 01:01:32,989
More coffee?

1009
01:01:35,791 --> 01:01:37,794
Thanks, Hans.

1010
01:01:59,481 --> 01:02:01,350
It will be okay.

1011
01:02:06,822 --> 01:02:07,389
Miles.

1012
01:02:07,422 --> 01:02:08,757
What's good, Jack?

1013
01:02:08,791 --> 01:02:10,226
Everything, man, everything.

1014
01:02:10,259 --> 01:02:11,126
How's the road?

1015
01:02:11,159 --> 01:02:12,795
Very nurturing, actually.

1016
01:02:12,827 --> 01:02:14,829
We have officially
farmed the state dry.

1017
01:02:14,862 --> 01:02:16,297
Really?

1018
01:02:16,331 --> 01:02:19,135
Then I guess it's time for you
to come back home then?

1019
01:02:19,168 --> 01:02:20,803
No, Jack. National.

1020
01:02:20,835 --> 01:02:21,836
What?

1021
01:02:21,869 --> 01:02:23,538
What do you mean national?

1022
01:02:23,572 --> 01:02:26,142
If North Carolina is any
indication of what we can do,

1023
01:02:26,175 --> 01:02:28,377
think about the
possibilities here.

1024
01:02:28,409 --> 01:02:30,478
Listen.

1025
01:02:30,512 --> 01:02:35,051
Miles, I gotta
tell you something.

1026
01:02:39,320 --> 01:02:42,458
National sounds great.

1027
01:02:42,490 --> 01:02:43,492
It's a good idea.

1028
01:02:43,525 --> 01:02:44,159
All right!

1029
01:02:44,193 --> 01:02:46,496
I knew you'd be on board, man.

1030
01:02:48,396 --> 01:02:49,998
Jack?

1031
01:02:50,032 --> 01:02:51,100
Jack.

1032
01:02:51,132 --> 01:02:52,467
Yeah, yeah.

1033
01:02:52,501 --> 01:02:54,436
I'll make the arrangements.

1034
01:02:54,469 --> 01:02:55,503
I miss you, man.

1035
01:02:55,536 --> 01:02:57,472
National, buddy.

1036
01:02:57,505 --> 01:02:58,840
Yeah.

1037
01:03:05,914 --> 01:03:08,918
Time to get to work.

1038
01:03:40,548 --> 01:03:42,552
Thanks, man.

1039
01:05:08,469 --> 01:05:09,971
Hoods up.

1040
01:05:12,574 --> 01:05:13,474
-Hey!
-Hey!

1041
01:05:13,509 --> 01:05:16,411
It's good to
see you, welcome back.

1042
01:05:16,445 --> 01:05:17,646
Good to see you too.

1043
01:05:17,679 --> 01:05:20,014
The lone prospector returns.

1044
01:05:20,047 --> 01:05:21,182
It's good to see you, Durwood.

1045
01:05:21,215 --> 01:05:22,451
Is that a little
grey I see in there?

1046
01:05:22,483 --> 01:05:24,485
Older and wiser from the road.

1047
01:05:24,518 --> 01:05:25,653
I guess he's all "growed up".

1048
01:05:25,686 --> 01:05:27,389
Why don't we have
those beers?

1049
01:05:27,422 --> 01:05:30,192
We got something
to show you first.

1050
01:05:30,224 --> 01:05:32,327
Told you we had a
surprise for you, right?

1051
01:05:32,360 --> 01:05:33,461
You did say that.

1052
01:05:37,132 --> 01:05:38,067
Okay.

1053
01:05:39,166 --> 01:05:41,336
Fearless leader!

1054
01:05:55,483 --> 01:05:57,652
This is where it all begins.

1055
01:05:57,686 --> 01:05:59,321
Donald, Lawrence and Tim,

1056
01:05:59,353 --> 01:06:02,123
some of the finest
in the coin business.

1057
01:06:02,157 --> 01:06:04,593
Error coins and
rarities are their game.

1058
01:06:04,626 --> 01:06:08,597
This is Durwood's
brilliant idea.

1059
01:06:08,630 --> 01:06:12,067
A clipped planchet
Eisenhower can go for $400.

1060
01:06:12,099 --> 01:06:15,770
A raised-rim Indian cent
can maybe fetch $100.

1061
01:06:15,804 --> 01:06:19,008
A double-struck quarter
can go for $1000.

1062
01:06:19,041 --> 01:06:20,309
Then there are the rarities.

1063
01:06:20,342 --> 01:06:21,510
That would be Hans.

1064
01:06:21,543 --> 01:06:24,113
Who is Hans?

1065
01:06:24,146 --> 01:06:26,148
Hello Supreme Leader!

1066
01:06:26,181 --> 01:06:28,483
Please don't do that,
don't do that ever again.

1067
01:06:28,516 --> 01:06:31,019
I am sorry, Supreme Leader.

1068
01:06:31,052 --> 01:06:33,621
I am sorry.
It's okay.

1069
01:06:33,655 --> 01:06:37,559
Hans here is in possession
of some very very rare coins.

1070
01:06:37,592 --> 01:06:39,795
Have you ever heard of a
1913 Liberty Head nickel?

1071
01:06:39,827 --> 01:06:41,130
Nope, never heard of one.

1072
01:06:41,163 --> 01:06:42,630
Well, you found one.

1073
01:06:42,664 --> 01:06:44,466
And now Hans has it.

1074
01:06:44,498 --> 01:06:45,666
Priceless.

1075
01:06:45,699 --> 01:06:48,703
What's to prevent Hans here
from just running off with it?

1076
01:06:48,737 --> 01:06:50,305
Never!

1077
01:06:50,338 --> 01:06:53,409
Supreme Leader has
given me everything.

1078
01:06:53,442 --> 01:06:54,476
Everything!

1079
01:06:54,509 --> 01:06:56,512
That, that is dedication.

1080
01:06:56,545 --> 01:06:59,748
Find me that 1849
double eagle, gentlemen.

1081
01:06:59,780 --> 01:07:01,549
-Yes, sir.
-Thank you.

1082
01:07:02,317 --> 01:07:04,452
All unremarkable
coins end up here,

1083
01:07:04,485 --> 01:07:07,155
where 55% of our profit is born.

1084
01:07:07,188 --> 01:07:10,259
I know, it ain't
much to see but,

1085
01:07:10,291 --> 01:07:13,795
it is beautiful hearing all
those dollars rake in, right?

1086
01:07:13,829 --> 01:07:15,597
Now, you're gonna wanna
wear one of these.

1087
01:07:21,135 --> 01:07:22,538
Fearless leader.

1088
01:07:22,570 --> 01:07:24,572
We melt the coins
down to their very essence.

1089
01:07:24,606 --> 01:07:27,209
Pre-1963 dimes and
quarters for pure silver,

1090
01:07:27,242 --> 01:07:29,278
World War II nickels
for copper and silver.

1091
01:07:29,311 --> 01:07:32,780
So I guess this is
where currency comes to die.

1092
01:07:32,813 --> 01:07:35,750
No, to
be reborn, Miles.

1093
01:07:35,784 --> 01:07:38,586
And at three to 6,000%
increase in value.

1094
01:07:38,619 --> 01:07:40,556
I'm pretty
sure it's illegal, Jack.

1095
01:07:40,588 --> 01:07:41,856
No, it's not illegal.

1096
01:07:41,889 --> 01:07:44,460
We Googled it, we Binged
it, we asked Jeeves.

1097
01:07:44,492 --> 01:07:46,594
Who will return to
retrieve their coin?

1098
01:07:46,628 --> 01:07:48,363
Do you think they care
what happens to them?

1099
01:07:48,396 --> 01:07:49,832
Who do you think
we're hurting here?

1100
01:07:49,864 --> 01:07:52,166
It's not illegal.

1101
01:07:52,199 --> 01:07:54,169
It's capitalism.

1102
01:07:57,271 --> 01:08:03,112
Here's to Miles with
the fountains, home again.

1103
01:08:07,581 --> 01:08:09,451
Okay, guys.

1104
01:08:09,483 --> 01:08:11,752
How did this all happen?

1105
01:08:11,786 --> 01:08:13,255
This is a caricature.

1106
01:08:13,288 --> 01:08:14,456
A caricature of what?

1107
01:08:14,489 --> 01:08:17,326
You said you wanted something
unique, something of our own.

1108
01:08:17,359 --> 01:08:18,827
I said hire nobody else.

1109
01:08:18,859 --> 01:08:20,895
We agreed to hire nobody else
and you went out and hired

1110
01:08:20,929 --> 01:08:22,564
a freaking army, man.

1111
01:08:22,596 --> 01:08:24,166
-We hired a few guys.
-A few?

1112
01:08:24,198 --> 01:08:26,501
To be fair, you hired
what's her name, Penelope?

1113
01:08:26,534 --> 01:08:28,604
Okay, I needed Penelope out
there to help me just as much

1114
01:08:28,636 --> 01:08:30,805
as you needed Durwood here
and you were fine with it.

1115
01:08:30,838 --> 01:08:34,376
Durwood, did you
agree to all this?

1116
01:08:34,408 --> 01:08:35,743
No.

1117
01:08:35,777 --> 01:08:38,514
I didn't agree to it.

1118
01:08:38,546 --> 01:08:40,481
It was my idea.

1119
01:08:40,515 --> 01:08:43,919
If you're gonna blame
somebody, blame me.

1120
01:08:43,952 --> 01:08:45,454
I see.

1121
01:08:46,488 --> 01:08:48,791
Yeah, great.

1122
01:08:52,327 --> 01:08:53,729
What's up with the
two gold watches?

1123
01:08:53,761 --> 01:08:55,264
Is that really necessary?

1124
01:08:55,296 --> 01:08:56,464
One's west coast time.

1125
01:08:56,497 --> 01:08:58,567
Tim, go get a glass.

1126
01:09:03,438 --> 01:09:04,605
What kind of glass?

1127
01:09:04,639 --> 01:09:05,541
A glass.

1128
01:09:05,573 --> 01:09:06,474
A glass!

1129
01:09:07,509 --> 01:09:08,543
Sheesh!

1130
01:09:08,577 --> 01:09:10,179
I can't lose this job, guys.

1131
01:09:10,212 --> 01:09:12,214
No one can.

1132
01:09:12,247 --> 01:09:13,248
Here's the glass,
here's the glass.

1133
01:09:13,280 --> 01:09:14,416
Thank you, finally!

1134
01:09:14,448 --> 01:09:16,951
What is the real problem
here, are you mad at my watches,

1135
01:09:16,984 --> 01:09:19,253
or is it that this all
happened in your absence?

1136
01:09:19,287 --> 01:09:21,456
That without you, we took
a legitimate opportunity

1137
01:09:21,488 --> 01:09:23,658
and actualized it to
its infinite potential,

1138
01:09:23,692 --> 01:09:24,859
those are you words, Miles!
Yeah yeah!

1139
01:09:24,893 --> 01:09:26,194
Infinite potential,
yes, but we have it

1140
01:09:26,228 --> 01:09:27,395
without all of this, okay?

1141
01:09:27,429 --> 01:09:29,597
This is a freaking bureaucracy
that we were trying to avoid.

1142
01:09:29,631 --> 01:09:30,899
This is all the corporate
stuff that we didn't want...

1143
01:09:30,931 --> 01:09:32,600
What's
not to like here?

1144
01:09:32,634 --> 01:09:33,402
You're turning it
into something else!

1145
01:09:33,435 --> 01:09:35,204
Now it is a weight
on our shoulders!

1146
01:09:35,237 --> 01:09:37,538
It's weight, yeah, it's
weight in our pockets, man.

1147
01:09:40,307 --> 01:09:41,643
I send you the
package, you smash them

1148
01:09:41,676 --> 01:09:43,612
and you put 'em
in the bank, okay?

1149
01:09:43,645 --> 01:09:46,248
You think that you are on
the cusp of being a millionaire

1150
01:09:46,280 --> 01:09:48,884
because of you and your
broom and Penelope,

1151
01:09:48,917 --> 01:09:51,486
we took your idea and we
grew it, we made it bigger,

1152
01:09:51,519 --> 01:09:53,622
we made it better, it's
working, it's a success!

1153
01:09:53,654 --> 01:09:54,822
We were trying to
get out of the cubicle,

1154
01:09:54,855 --> 01:09:56,557
you're taking me right back!

1155
01:09:56,591 --> 01:09:58,293
We made something good, you
wanna knock it down, go ahead,

1156
01:09:58,326 --> 01:10:00,295
fire them, I'm not gonna do it!

1157
01:10:01,997 --> 01:10:03,231
What goes, guys?

1158
01:10:03,965 --> 01:10:06,534
Not now, Hans!

1159
01:10:06,568 --> 01:10:09,637
Our fate hangs by a string.

1160
01:10:11,672 --> 01:10:12,675
Shoot.

1161
01:10:15,676 --> 01:10:16,612
Fearless leader!

1162
01:10:16,645 --> 01:10:19,248
Fearless leader!

1163
01:10:19,280 --> 01:10:21,283
A
Glass for your beer?

1164
01:10:51,880 --> 01:10:53,515
My god.

1165
01:10:53,547 --> 01:10:55,617
It's so good to see you.

1166
01:10:58,386 --> 01:11:00,055
Hi.

1167
01:11:00,087 --> 01:11:02,023
Hey.

1168
01:11:02,823 --> 01:11:04,893
God, I really missed you.

1169
01:11:06,694 --> 01:11:09,630
Hey after you left
I ran into those guys

1170
01:11:09,663 --> 01:11:12,667
that were looking for you,
I didn't say anything.

1171
01:11:14,636 --> 01:11:16,505
I

1172
01:11:16,537 --> 01:11:19,040
I made these for you.

1173
01:11:20,608 --> 01:11:21,743
It's okay, they're just...

1174
01:11:21,775 --> 01:11:23,577
They're perfect.

1175
01:11:23,610 --> 01:11:24,613
Will you put them on me?

1176
01:11:24,645 --> 01:11:26,648
Yeah, yeah.

1177
01:11:37,625 --> 01:11:39,661
Let's see.

1178
01:11:39,694 --> 01:11:41,297
You look gorgeous.

1179
01:11:42,430 --> 01:11:43,530
I brought you your sweater.

1180
01:11:43,564 --> 01:11:46,801
I don't care about my sweater,
it's...

1181
01:11:51,139 --> 01:11:53,574
I turned myself in.

1182
01:11:57,578 --> 01:11:59,847
Is that passion fruit?

1183
01:11:59,881 --> 01:12:01,583
It's like a mixed mango.

1184
01:12:05,119 --> 01:12:07,756
I found the note you
left in the fountain.

1185
01:12:09,690 --> 01:12:10,992
I love you too.

1186
01:12:12,127 --> 01:12:13,829
Good.

1187
01:12:13,862 --> 01:12:15,764
I want to make this work.

1188
01:12:15,796 --> 01:12:18,132
I'll wait, okay?

1189
01:12:18,166 --> 01:12:19,601
I have to go.

1190
01:12:19,634 --> 01:12:20,969
Just...

1191
01:12:45,926 --> 01:12:48,630
She's beautiful, Miles.

1192
01:12:48,662 --> 01:12:50,798
That's what was so worth
it, that was your hire?

1193
01:12:53,201 --> 01:12:54,703
All right.

1194
01:12:54,735 --> 01:12:55,636
Call 'em up, Jack.

1195
01:12:55,670 --> 01:12:57,538
You call 'em up, Miles.

1196
01:13:00,507 --> 01:13:02,543
So you wanted to see me?

1197
01:13:02,577 --> 01:13:05,480
Yeah, I know we really
haven't had a chance to get to

1198
01:13:05,512 --> 01:13:07,649
know each other
much, you know, but,

1199
01:13:07,681 --> 01:13:09,617
you seem like a stand-up guy.

1200
01:13:09,650 --> 01:13:11,685
Makes it all the
harder to do this,

1201
01:13:11,719 --> 01:13:13,922
I'm gonna have to

1202
01:13:13,954 --> 01:13:15,957
let you...

1203
01:13:15,989 --> 01:13:17,492
Yeah, just let me flourish.

1204
01:13:17,524 --> 01:13:18,092
I understand.

1205
01:13:18,126 --> 01:13:18,960
I gotta let you go.

1206
01:13:18,993 --> 01:13:19,828
Go where?

1207
01:13:19,860 --> 01:13:20,729
Go get you some coffee?

1208
01:13:20,761 --> 01:13:22,797
Okay, you're...

1209
01:13:22,831 --> 01:13:24,199
Why?

1210
01:13:24,231 --> 01:13:25,801
It's just, things have
gotten a little out of hand.

1211
01:13:25,833 --> 01:13:28,170
We started in crazy. Why
is crazy affecting us now?

1212
01:13:28,203 --> 01:13:30,639
My wife, she's about
to have a little baby.

1213
01:13:30,671 --> 01:13:32,640
I'm supposed to check out
the sonogram this week.

1214
01:13:32,673 --> 01:13:34,542
And I have student
loans coming to my ears.

1215
01:13:34,576 --> 01:13:37,578
You know, to get down here I
bought a $125,000 Winnebago.

1216
01:13:37,612 --> 01:13:40,782
Right here, next months'
projected earnings.

1217
01:13:40,814 --> 01:13:42,049
Sorry, I'm sorry.

1218
01:13:42,082 --> 01:13:43,717
Don't tell me
it's Tim, is it Tim?

1219
01:13:43,751 --> 01:13:44,886
What did Tim say?
What did he say?

1220
01:13:44,918 --> 01:13:47,521
Fire those sketchy guys, you
know who I'm talking about.

1221
01:13:47,555 --> 01:13:52,527
I'd like to extend an
invitation to our annual...

1222
01:13:52,560 --> 01:13:54,062
Bake-off?

1223
01:13:55,162 --> 01:13:58,632
An exit strategy, or I'm
gonna burn the place down.

1224
01:13:58,666 --> 01:13:59,701
That's it.

1225
01:13:59,734 --> 01:14:00,902
That's it.

1226
01:14:00,935 --> 01:14:01,903
You know what?
This is bullsh...

1227
01:14:01,935 --> 01:14:02,903
Thank you.

1228
01:14:02,936 --> 01:14:06,841
Thank you.

1229
01:14:25,092 --> 01:14:26,494
It's done.

1230
01:14:28,529 --> 01:14:29,597
You got your way.

1231
01:14:29,631 --> 01:14:31,233
I'm done too, okay?

1232
01:14:31,265 --> 01:14:33,601
Consider me fired as well.

1233
01:14:33,635 --> 01:14:35,570
Listen, Miles,
this is your baby.

1234
01:14:35,603 --> 01:14:38,105
Reset it, you can
rehire those guys.

1235
01:14:38,139 --> 01:14:39,106
Do what you gotta do.

1236
01:14:39,140 --> 01:14:40,242
Let me get this straight.

1237
01:14:40,274 --> 01:14:41,710
You just fired
everybody, now you

1238
01:14:41,743 --> 01:14:43,645
dump it in our laps
and you're gonna bail?

1239
01:14:43,677 --> 01:14:45,012
Jack, I'm not cut
out for this, okay?

1240
01:14:45,046 --> 01:14:46,847
You go out that door,
you know what it means.

1241
01:14:46,881 --> 01:14:49,150
Then we're done.

1242
01:14:49,182 --> 01:14:50,252
We're done done.

1243
01:14:50,284 --> 01:14:52,153
Then we're done done.

1244
01:14:55,789 --> 01:14:57,692
Jack, relax.

1245
01:14:57,725 --> 01:14:58,593
You relax.

1246
01:14:58,626 --> 01:15:00,262
Just calm down.

1247
01:15:03,698 --> 01:15:05,567
I see.

1248
01:15:06,768 --> 01:15:09,203
You're just gonna take
your ball and go home.

1249
01:15:11,605 --> 01:15:15,877
Good luck.

1250
01:15:20,180 --> 01:15:21,983
Way to go, Durwood.

1251
01:15:22,850 --> 01:15:24,185
Me?

1252
01:15:24,217 --> 01:15:26,555
Everything's fallen apart
and it's because of you.

1253
01:15:26,587 --> 01:15:28,923
Look, you can fix
this, this is fixable.

1254
01:15:28,957 --> 01:15:30,825
This all started the
minute we brought you on.

1255
01:15:30,858 --> 01:15:32,594
I told him not to
hire you and he did.

1256
01:15:32,627 --> 01:15:35,297
Swallow your pride, son.

1257
01:15:36,663 --> 01:15:38,666
You're fired.

1258
01:15:38,699 --> 01:15:39,701
You can't fire me.

1259
01:15:39,734 --> 01:15:40,602
I just did.

1260
01:15:40,635 --> 01:15:42,070
You're fired.

1261
01:15:42,103 --> 01:15:42,938
You're fired.

1262
01:15:42,970 --> 01:15:44,138
You're fired!

1263
01:15:45,739 --> 01:15:47,309
I'm gonna go after my
friend and when we get back,

1264
01:15:47,341 --> 01:15:48,509
you should not be here.

1265
01:15:48,542 --> 01:15:52,613
We'll be in touch if a position
becomes open down the line.

1266
01:15:52,646 --> 01:15:55,951
Look, now is not the
time to talk to Miles.

1267
01:15:55,984 --> 01:16:00,355
Calm down, let him calm
down, give it some time.

1268
01:16:00,387 --> 01:16:05,126
Goodbye, Durwood.

1269
01:16:13,400 --> 01:16:15,135
Not now, Hans.

1270
01:16:15,168 --> 01:16:16,671
It's okay.

1271
01:17:58,773 --> 01:18:00,742
How'd you find me, man?

1272
01:18:03,176 --> 01:18:04,945
You like to gamble.

1273
01:18:06,380 --> 01:18:09,251
Once in a blue moon I
like to gamble with you.

1274
01:18:11,485 --> 01:18:12,820
Listen I...

1275
01:18:12,854 --> 01:18:14,255
That got pretty...

1276
01:18:14,287 --> 01:18:16,057
Yeah, I know.

1277
01:18:16,990 --> 01:18:19,394
I was ready, man,
I was on board.

1278
01:18:20,528 --> 01:18:22,764
What did you want
out of all that?

1279
01:18:24,765 --> 01:18:26,500
Jack, if you asked me
that when we first started,

1280
01:18:26,533 --> 01:18:29,336
you know, I would
have said success but,

1281
01:18:31,372 --> 01:18:34,376
all I want is Penelope,

1282
01:18:36,042 --> 01:18:37,878
and my best friend back.

1283
01:18:39,146 --> 01:18:42,117
And I'm sorry
because it really...

1284
01:18:44,252 --> 01:18:45,821
I'm sorry.

1285
01:18:49,390 --> 01:18:53,962
What's next?

1286
01:20:14,140 --> 01:20:15,542
Durwood!

1287
01:20:15,576 --> 01:20:17,011
Durwood!

1288
01:20:19,447 --> 01:20:21,949
Durwood? Come on, man!

1289
01:20:21,983 --> 01:20:25,485
Hey look, I'm sorry about
the way we handled that, man.

1290
01:20:25,519 --> 01:20:27,588
We were out of line and,

1291
01:20:27,622 --> 01:20:29,990
it's just plain
wrong, all right?

1292
01:20:30,024 --> 01:20:31,526
Where you at?

1293
01:20:35,195 --> 01:20:36,597
His stuff's still back there.

1294
01:20:36,631 --> 01:20:42,003
And I got like 10 voicemails.

1295
01:20:46,172 --> 01:20:50,010
Are you here to see Durwood?

1296
01:20:54,247 --> 01:20:55,884
Are you two on the list?

1297
01:20:55,917 --> 01:20:57,418
We can be.

1298
01:20:57,451 --> 01:20:58,453
What are your names?

1299
01:20:58,485 --> 01:21:00,354
-Miles.
-Jack.

1300
01:21:02,023 --> 01:21:04,626
He's asked to see
the two of you last.

1301
01:21:05,592 --> 01:21:07,095
Okay.

1302
01:21:07,127 --> 01:21:08,128
Thanks.

1303
01:21:19,539 --> 01:21:21,542
He's ready for you.

1304
01:21:34,121 --> 01:21:36,423
Miles with the fountains.

1305
01:21:46,466 --> 01:21:48,235
What happened?

1306
01:21:50,104 --> 01:21:51,573
The inevitable.

1307
01:21:55,109 --> 01:22:01,682
I I got you something.

1308
01:22:06,220 --> 01:22:09,324
You know, sometimes I

1309
01:22:09,356 --> 01:22:11,626
wonder what kind of
old man I'll make,

1310
01:22:11,658 --> 01:22:14,429
and I sure as hell hope I'm
as cool as you, Durwood.

1311
01:22:14,462 --> 01:22:15,697
I really do.

1312
01:22:17,030 --> 01:22:20,301
Strange thing to think.

1313
01:22:24,537 --> 01:22:29,510
I wanna tell you something.

1314
01:22:34,047 --> 01:22:35,617
What do you need?

1315
01:22:39,520 --> 01:22:41,756
You gave me this.

1316
01:22:41,788 --> 01:22:43,324
Yeah.

1317
01:22:44,457 --> 01:22:46,360
This is good.

1318
01:22:50,430 --> 01:22:52,266
This.

1319
01:22:54,034 --> 01:22:55,569
Better.

1320
01:23:02,143 --> 01:23:03,277
You all right?

1321
01:23:03,310 --> 01:23:05,146
Durwood, are you okay?

1322
01:23:09,350 --> 01:23:11,252
This doesn't feel real.

1323
01:23:12,252 --> 01:23:13,487
That's the way it is.

1324
01:23:14,555 --> 01:23:15,690
What'd you say?

1325
01:23:15,722 --> 01:23:17,524
What's that?

1326
01:23:17,557 --> 01:23:20,494
That's the way it is.

1327
01:23:21,561 --> 01:23:23,497
It's the way it is.

1328
01:23:24,564 --> 01:23:27,101
Well we'll see
you tomorrow, right?

1329
01:23:29,837 --> 01:23:31,139
Tomorrow.

1330
01:23:31,171 --> 01:23:33,007
Good. Yeah.

1331
01:23:47,654 --> 01:23:49,090
Good morning, gentlemen.

1332
01:23:49,122 --> 01:23:50,424
Morning.

1333
01:23:50,457 --> 01:23:51,259
I'm Jack.

1334
01:23:51,292 --> 01:23:52,660
Eli.

1335
01:23:52,693 --> 01:23:53,594
-Miles.
-Miles.

1336
01:23:53,627 --> 01:23:54,629
Pleasure to meet you, sir.

1337
01:23:54,662 --> 01:23:55,697
Nice to meet you too.

1338
01:23:57,864 --> 01:24:01,301
Before we start, we just
wanted to make it clear that

1339
01:24:01,335 --> 01:24:03,237
we intend on
covering everything.

1340
01:24:03,270 --> 01:24:05,440
Spare no expenses,
he was the best.

1341
01:24:05,472 --> 01:24:08,576
Well I appreciate the
gesture, it's very noble

1342
01:24:08,609 --> 01:24:10,445
but it's all taken care of.

1343
01:24:10,478 --> 01:24:12,579
I don't understand.

1344
01:24:13,581 --> 01:24:15,516
I'll leave that to
somebody better equipped.

1345
01:24:15,548 --> 01:24:17,652
Come on in!

1346
01:24:22,323 --> 01:24:23,591
Hi, gentlemen.

1347
01:24:24,692 --> 01:24:27,161
Surely this will be
a lot to take in,

1348
01:24:27,194 --> 01:24:29,564
but I wanted you
to hear it from me.

1349
01:24:29,596 --> 01:24:32,833
I'm Durwood's daughter.

1350
01:24:37,537 --> 01:24:38,705
Thank you.

1351
01:24:41,442 --> 01:24:43,310
You must be Miles.

1352
01:24:43,344 --> 01:24:44,744
Yes.

1353
01:24:44,778 --> 01:24:46,681
And you're Jack.

1354
01:24:46,713 --> 01:24:47,515
Yeah.

1355
01:24:47,547 --> 01:24:48,282
Good to meet you.

1356
01:24:48,315 --> 01:24:50,885
I've heard a lot
about you both.

1357
01:24:50,917 --> 01:24:54,554
My father was many things.

1358
01:24:54,587 --> 01:24:57,190
Most notably a man of

1359
01:24:57,224 --> 01:24:58,860
celebration.

1360
01:24:58,893 --> 01:25:02,462
But he wasn't exactly
the man that you

1361
01:25:02,496 --> 01:25:04,399
thought he was.

1362
01:25:06,900 --> 01:25:10,238
What I'm trying to say is,

1363
01:25:11,204 --> 01:25:15,542
my father was a
self-made billionaire.

1364
01:25:25,653 --> 01:25:28,222
He had many enterprises.

1365
01:25:28,255 --> 01:25:30,625
In a younger life he
was a war veteran,

1366
01:25:30,658 --> 01:25:33,595
a surgeon, and always
a man of his word.

1367
01:25:37,698 --> 01:25:42,503
But, Bone Doctor's Sauce

1368
01:25:42,536 --> 01:25:44,873
was his life's passion.

1369
01:25:49,210 --> 01:25:50,377
Old family secret.

1370
01:25:50,411 --> 01:25:52,712
His diagnosis gave
him very little time,

1371
01:25:52,746 --> 01:25:55,650
so he dedicated himself
to one final act.

1372
01:25:55,682 --> 01:25:59,252
He returned to a station
in life he once knew,

1373
01:25:59,286 --> 01:26:01,756
under the guise
of utter poverty.

1374
01:26:01,788 --> 01:26:05,792
He wanted to prove the good
in people on his own terms.

1375
01:26:07,394 --> 01:26:09,630
Apparently,

1376
01:26:09,662 --> 01:26:12,599
you two,

1377
01:26:12,632 --> 01:26:15,235
balanced the scales.

1378
01:26:17,304 --> 01:26:19,606
I can see why it
was worth it to him.

1379
01:26:19,640 --> 01:26:22,577
Gentlemen,

1380
01:26:22,609 --> 01:26:26,980
Mr. Hamilton's last will
and testament grants you

1381
01:26:27,014 --> 01:26:29,650
limited power of his estate

1382
01:26:29,682 --> 01:26:33,688
to decide which charities will
receive 90% of his wealth,

1383
01:26:33,720 --> 01:26:37,390
and the rest will be allocated
amongst his 12 grandchildren.

1384
01:26:37,423 --> 01:26:41,362
And along with requesting your
compliance as pallbearers,

1385
01:26:41,395 --> 01:26:44,999
he's asked me to
read you these words.

1386
01:26:45,032 --> 01:26:46,801
"Start again."

1387
01:27:12,458 --> 01:27:14,561
The world
is still here.

1388
01:27:16,630 --> 01:27:19,467
But a shade less
bright without you.

1389
01:27:22,770 --> 01:27:26,040
I think you'll find your troubles
have a way of growing up

1390
01:27:26,073 --> 01:27:27,942
and leaving home.

1391
01:27:30,344 --> 01:27:33,346
Not through the door,
not out the window,

1392
01:27:33,380 --> 01:27:35,917
but gone none the less.

1393
01:27:39,552 --> 01:27:42,523
May your family have bread so
that they never know hunger,

1394
01:27:42,555 --> 01:27:45,525
and salt so life
always has flavor.

1395
01:27:59,972 --> 01:28:01,942
We will
always deal in coin

1396
01:28:01,975 --> 01:28:04,345
with the understanding
that its purpose springs

1397
01:28:04,377 --> 01:28:06,680
only from the hand beneath it.

1398
01:28:25,599 --> 01:28:27,935
For now,

1399
01:28:27,967 --> 01:28:30,037
we just live.

1400
01:29:26,560 --> 01:29:30,798
They say youth
is wasted on the young,

1401
01:29:30,831 --> 01:29:34,668
but in three months, you
and I will prove otherwise.

1402
01:29:37,438 --> 01:29:39,539
Sending you well wishes.
