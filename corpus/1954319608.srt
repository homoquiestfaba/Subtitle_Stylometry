00:01:11,378 --> 00:01:14,224
<i>There was a rich merchant.</i>

<i>good and brave, he lived for the happiness of
six children by his wife's death.</i>

<i>Three girls and three boys
filled the house after her mother's absence.</i>

7
00:01:29,702 --> 00:01:32,648
A small guest!
- She wants to hear the story.

8
00:01:35,269 --> 00:01:39,965
All we want something.
But quietly, or will not come true.

9
00:01:43,539 --> 00:01:45,841
Purposed you want?
- Yes!

10
00:01:46,485 --> 00:01:50,762
Then, one... two... three!

11
00:02:00,716 --> 00:02:04,497
All right. Want to hear a story?
- Yes!

12
00:02:07,461 --> 00:02:12,024
<i>had three merchant ships

<i>One was called "Siren"
other - "Triton".</i>

14
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:17,695
<i>And third, the largest, "Livia".</i>

Do not touch it!

27
00:03:44,135 --> 00:03:48,378
Well, take it.
We can not carry it with you.

28
00:03:52,852 --> 00:03:56,649
Immediately leave!
- Daddy, do something!

29
00:04:00,053 --> 00:04:04,476
No, our jewelry, everything!
- Fear will die!

30
00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:09,679
Do not call me daddy with these people!
And you, Anne, Stop whining!

31
00:04:10,878 --> 00:04:16,748
My heart! Poor you! Are you satisfied?
Goodbye!

32
00:04:17,793 --> 00:04:20,703
Dad, this is a disaster!
Where are we!

33
00:04:22,065 --> 00:04:26,002
Where is Bell?
- Bell, Bell! Still it!

34
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:36,916
Take this.

35
00:04:39,993 --> 00:04:41,845
Help little!

36
00:04:43,154 --> 00:04:45,653
What's inside?
- All my books.

37
00:04:46,967 --> 00:04:50,889
Notebooks, notes...
You do not want to leave them here?

38
00:04:51,054 --> 00:04:52,567
Tristan!

39
00:04:53,593 --> 00:04:55,932
What is it?
- Keep an eye on his father.

40
00:04:56,128 --> 00:05:00,191
And do not let Maxim to spend
and the last thing you have left.

41
00:05:00,327 --> 00:05:03,024
Take it easy. Everything will be fine.

42
00:05:04,224 --> 00:05:06,024
Be careful.

43
00:05:15,112 --> 00:05:19,114
These fools why do not you go?
- Do not listen to them.

44
00:05:19,425 --> 00:05:23,798
Now what? Going to the village?

45
00:05:25,009 --> 00:05:28,883
It is better to take some time to
to forget. Do not you think?

46
00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:32,212
Bell!

47
00:05:36,712 --> 00:05:38,712
Bell!

48
00:05:51,564 --> 00:05:53,122
Here, Mom.

49
00:05:53,298 --> 00:05:57,288
Start a new life and I
I'm ready.

50
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:07,983
Why should we leave the countryside?

51
00:06:09,379 --> 00:06:12,998
It should.
- You too will like it.

52
00:06:13,403 --> 00:06:15,766
I'm sure.
- I know.

53
00:06:15,944 --> 00:06:18,831
Wear with pride and power
this family.

54
00:06:21,268 --> 00:06:24,089
Will be listening as always.

55
00:06:51,802 --> 00:06:55,083
<i>They need time
to adjust to her new life.</i>

56
00:06:55,182 --> 00:06:59,988
<i>first night, Bell remained awake
to hear the sound of the village.</i>

57
00:07:00,878 --> 00:07:02,993
<i>With the help of his brothers,</i>

58
00:07:03,422 --> 00:07:07,414
<i>it implemented in order garden
and there he found his solace.</i>

59
00:07:08,443 --> 00:07:10,245
Heat's my

60
00:07:11,402 --> 00:07:13,257
Wrinkle!

61
00:07:14,097 --> 00:07:15,960
What is this beast?

62
00:07:25,657 --> 00:07:30,980
Almost a month living in this hell.
We die alone. Creased.

63
00:07:31,271 --> 00:07:32,900
Resembling beasts.

64
00:07:37,066 --> 00:07:41,473
Bell! Happiness disgusts me.
You need to drown in the well.

65
00:07:41,595 --> 00:07:44,539
Or to bury
live in her beloved garden.

66
00:07:44,939 --> 00:07:46,824
What are you doing?

67
00:07:50,089 --> 00:07:53,385
Clotilde is sick, will have breakfast in bed.
- You can not.

68
00:07:53,576 --> 00:07:56,522
After lunch we all go
clean garden.

69
00:07:56,652 --> 00:07:59,814
I'd rather die.
- Come on, everybody down!

70
00:08:09,318 --> 00:08:10,846
<i>loser...</i>

71
00:08:11,009 --> 00:08:12,565
<i>place...</i>

72
00:08:14,650 --> 00:08:16,512
was shot three times.

73
00:08:17,637 --> 00:08:19,934
The young man left the battlefield

74
00:08:20,047 --> 00:08:21,908
and disappeared into the deep forest.

75
00:08:31,433 --> 00:08:34,223
At all admiralty
I rejoiced.

76
00:08:34,369 --> 00:08:36,243
Dumont was very glamor.

77
00:08:36,643 --> 00:08:40,123
Imagine his great
daughter married Count.

78
00:08:40,456 --> 00:08:42,116
But the big news is

79
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:45,974
that "Cheese"
Sweetheart your mother

80
00:08:46,944 --> 00:08:48,567
is detected.

81
00:08:49,217 --> 00:08:53,270
The journey is long,
but will soon be on the beach.

82
00:08:53,411 --> 00:08:55,611
A load.
- Safely.

83
00:08:56,177 --> 00:08:57,768
Children, we are saved!

84
00:08:58,484 --> 00:09:00,847
To finish packing.
Actually - no!

85
00:09:01,036 --> 00:09:03,877
Better to burn them!
- My heart beats!

86
00:09:03,977 --> 00:09:06,576
I'm alive, Dad. Survived.

87
00:09:06,891 --> 00:09:10,630
We must return immediately.
Now we need new dresses.

88
00:09:10,839 --> 00:09:13,853
Perfume and what else?
- Nail.

89
00:09:14,369 --> 00:09:16,675
Happiness of the city!
- O city!

90
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,700
You will come with me.

91
00:09:19,667 --> 00:09:22,071
It is time to introduce his successor.

92
00:09:22,930 --> 00:09:25,695
I will not disappoint you, Dad.
Thank you.

93
00:09:25,802 --> 00:09:30,512
He won against your friends.
The young man returned home.

94
00:09:30,614 --> 00:09:33,451
In three children among their people.

95
00:09:33,744 --> 00:09:35,285
To finish.

96
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:40,992
New novel you, brother?
- Something better. It will be a masterpiece.

97
00:09:55,069 --> 00:09:56,956
What about you?

98
00:09:58,069 --> 00:09:59,869
Are you mad?

99
00:10:00,569 --> 00:10:04,235
Obviously, when the girl is sad
say they are angry.

100
00:10:04,402 --> 00:10:06,967
And if it is a cheerful,
say it is stupid.

101
00:10:07,122 --> 00:10:10,583
How do they know?
Everybody's happy except you.

102
00:10:16,268 --> 00:10:19,998
I wanted to stay longer.
This is

103
00:10:22,065 --> 00:10:26,741
We came here to hide from the shame
our life is not here.

104
00:10:27,548 --> 00:10:29,501
Sam know what awaits us.

105
00:10:29,648 --> 00:10:32,521
Maxim will meet with bums
who called friends.

106
00:10:32,668 --> 00:10:36,190
Ann and Clotilde will scurry like crazy
to look for men.

107
00:10:36,508 --> 00:10:38,994
Again you will be busy with their work.

108
00:10:39,496 --> 00:10:42,398
Bell one day nothing
be relevant,

109
00:10:42,502 --> 00:10:44,907
But you grow up, your life will pass.

110
00:10:45,215 --> 00:10:48,920
I love you, but I must tell you,
that one day a woman.

111
00:10:50,478 --> 00:10:53,250
To help you remember something.
Case.

112
00:10:59,062 --> 00:11:01,309
What do you want me to bring?

113
00:11:02,419 --> 00:11:06,890
Only one rose.
Here I did not catch any.

114
00:11:36,317 --> 00:11:37,939
<i>Loan sharks took everything.</i>

115
00:11:38,070 --> 00:11:41,488
<i>Now my ban
To get your own ship.</i>

116
00:11:41,847 --> 00:11:43,675
You have to understand.

117
00:11:43,783 --> 00:11:48,209
"Cheese" and his burden
not belong to you anymore.

118
00:11:50,182 --> 00:11:52,024
You forget something.

119
00:11:52,209 --> 00:11:56,439
If not for me, this place
would be just a fishing village.

120
00:11:56,842 --> 00:11:59,979
You played a poor friend.

121
00:12:00,441 --> 00:12:03,255
You signed all letters of credit.

122
00:12:03,642 --> 00:12:05,635
I've already inquired.

123
00:12:07,817 --> 00:12:10,401
I do not disparage, Dumont.

124
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:13,345
If not for me,
would not be sitting at this desk!

125
00:12:13,445 --> 00:12:17,605
Were not you the one
who lost influence and wealth?

126
00:12:17,705 --> 00:12:20,432
I'll break your head!
- Stop it!

127
00:12:22,764 --> 00:12:26,867
You do not understand.
No longer has any power.

128
00:12:28,283 --> 00:12:31,138
You are no longer bourgeois.
Already a none.

129
00:12:34,413 --> 00:12:36,266
I'm sorry your dad.

130
00:12:43,972 --> 00:12:45,548
Maxim!

131
00:13:02,801 --> 00:13:06,822
I see a man.
It should not be ignored.

132
00:13:07,765 --> 00:13:10,021
He brings great news.

133
00:13:12,433 --> 00:13:17,961
News? Good or bad?
- You'll know when downloading maps.

134
00:13:20,309 --> 00:13:23,476
You want to please me, Astrid?

135
00:13:24,157 --> 00:13:26,369
Tell me something nice.

136
00:13:26,567 --> 00:13:30,086
I look at the cards.
I can not lie.

137
00:13:30,673 --> 00:13:33,367
I warn you not to scar?

138
00:13:47,498 --> 00:13:49,372
Land of gold.

139
00:13:49,731 --> 00:13:52,201
Moonlight.

140
00:13:52,896 --> 00:13:54,558
Your fate is smiling.

141
00:13:55,380 --> 00:13:57,978
Gold moonlight.

142
00:13:58,538 --> 00:14:00,683
Come cheers!

143
00:14:02,610 --> 00:14:05,181
I'll buy you as rich.

144
00:14:05,481 --> 00:14:08,253
Anxious night. Smells of gunpowder.

145
00:14:08,769 --> 00:14:11,558
What'll it be?
- I am looking for my son.

146
00:14:11,658 --> 00:14:14,897
I was told that often comes here.
- All come here.

147
00:14:15,424 --> 00:14:18,537
Well, how do you say?

148
00:14:18,917 --> 00:14:21,152
Maxim de Bofremon.

149
00:14:25,506 --> 00:14:30,424
Do not talk anymore. must
you allowed to enter here.

150
00:14:30,687 --> 00:14:33,693
I need to find her son.
- You are not alone.

151
00:14:39,394 --> 00:14:41,389
Get out fast! Come on!

152
00:14:48,376 --> 00:14:50,026
The perfume you...

153
00:14:52,962 --> 00:14:55,306
and prediction...

154
00:14:57,228 --> 00:14:59,832
give you more power over me.

155
00:15:06,146 --> 00:15:08,215
Monsieur de Bofremon.

156
00:15:09,530 --> 00:15:12,018
For several months looking for Maxim.

157
00:15:12,419 --> 00:15:16,518
And I came across his old father.
- I do not know you.

158
00:15:17,032 --> 00:15:21,997
You are?
- Perdyugas. At your service.

159
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:31,265
Your son owes me a large sum,

160
00:15:31,376 --> 00:15:35,995
Now you will fix the bill.
And all will be forgotten.

161
00:15:36,095 --> 00:15:38,048
My son is not a gambler!

162
00:15:38,610 --> 00:15:41,288
Give them a drink
to leave us alone.

163
00:15:41,639 --> 00:15:43,524
He has the beggars.

164
00:15:46,295 --> 00:15:48,650
Do not you dare, Perdyugas.

165
00:15:49,025 --> 00:15:50,759
You know me.

166
00:15:52,371 --> 00:15:53,987
Leave the man alone.

167
00:16:02,186 --> 00:16:04,077
All right.

168
00:16:11,483 --> 00:16:14,829
And you, come quickly behind the bar.

169
00:16:16,073 --> 00:16:17,760
Come on.

170
00:16:18,935 --> 00:16:22,820
Courage you, but I will not leave you.
Get out!

171
00:17:19,860 --> 00:17:21,520
<i>On the way home,</i>

172
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:25,740
<i>trader struggled with the wind
cold and grief.</i>

173
00:17:26,590 --> 00:17:28,863
<i>left town without Maxim.</i>

174
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:32,938
<i>imagining him how wander alone in the dark
or even worse,</i>

175
00:17:33,050 --> 00:17:35,721
<i>lying in the dust with his throat cut.</i>

176
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:38,410
<i>He clutching the reins of his horse,</i>

177
00:17:38,650 --> 00:17:42,710
<i>hurry to go home,
hoping that his son was there.</i>

178
00:18:44,485 --> 00:18:47,112
I can not wear.

179
00:18:52,512 --> 00:18:54,073
Forgive me.

180
00:19:32,305 --> 00:19:34,187
House.

181
00:19:34,287 --> 00:19:36,087
I did it!

182
00:19:37,745 --> 00:19:40,606
But this is not it.

183
00:21:06,530 --> 00:21:08,110
Is anyone there?

184
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:23,520
I've lost my way.

185
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:28,580
It was open.

186
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:07,290
Who's there?

187
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:40,190
Rave.

188
00:22:42,690 --> 00:22:45,136
Or am I dead
and I am in heaven?

189
00:22:47,780 --> 00:22:49,630
No, apparently I live.

190
00:22:50,340 --> 00:22:52,260
And I'm hungry.

191
00:23:03,570 --> 00:23:06,120
I would like to get something from the table.

192
00:24:24,050 --> 00:24:25,770
Dresses.

193
00:24:28,730 --> 00:24:30,420
Scarves.

194
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:33,110
Powders.

195
00:24:33,540 --> 00:24:35,340
Incredibly, there is everything.

196
00:24:38,110 --> 00:24:40,040
Well, almost everything.

197
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:56,693
Who's better?

198
00:26:32,538 --> 00:26:37,367
I see that you do not reach the treasures.
He wanted to steal my dearest.

199
00:26:40,940 --> 00:26:44,290
Do not let me call
thief or coward.

200
00:26:45,970 --> 00:26:48,157
I'm a man of my word and honor.

201
00:26:48,260 --> 00:26:50,310
Who picked this rose?

202
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:58,433
For my youngest daughter.
I love her more than anything in the world.

203
00:26:58,620 --> 00:27:02,950
Then I will give you one day
to say goodbye to their loved ones.

204
00:27:03,110 --> 00:27:07,030
And remember the words:
"More than anything in the world. "

205
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:11,373
I'll whisper your horse
and he will bring you here.

206
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:16,510
I will not return.
- Yes, it will come back.

207
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:21,553
Otherwise it will kill you
all your children. One after another.

208
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:26,265
And finished first with a small,
because your favorite.

209
00:27:28,220 --> 00:27:30,350
Remember that.

210
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:34,457
A Life for a rose.

211
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:57,973
Here it is! That's it!

212
00:28:14,370 --> 00:28:17,080
That story Rose is a strange beast.

213
00:28:17,180 --> 00:28:19,680
Fables.
- A gift from where?

214
00:28:19,780 --> 00:28:21,780
No money for them.

215
00:28:22,110 --> 00:28:24,267
"More than anything in the world?"

216
00:28:25,650 --> 00:28:29,921
And as if by magic horse will find his way?
- It's all our fault.

217
00:28:30,190 --> 00:28:33,440
But do not ask rose.
- It's not anybody's!

218
00:28:33,540 --> 00:28:35,540
Shut up.

219
00:28:36,490 --> 00:28:38,970
I can not tell you who this beast

220
00:28:39,260 --> 00:28:44,951
but because I stole this rose,
Tomorrow should be returned to him.

221
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:51,875
What will you do?
- I do not know Tristan.

222
00:28:52,350 --> 00:28:55,696
Said - a life for a rose.

223
00:28:58,340 --> 00:29:03,448
And if you do not go?
- Then you will die.

224
00:29:03,548 --> 00:29:05,062
Everyone.

225
00:29:29,169 --> 00:29:33,010
Do not say anything.
I know what you all think.

226
00:29:33,690 --> 00:29:38,872
Mom died when I was born.
- I do not understand what the connection is.

227
00:29:40,470 --> 00:29:43,010
I do not want to die for me!

228
00:29:51,290 --> 00:29:53,189
<i>Bell! Bell!</i>

229
00:29:53,890 --> 00:29:55,700
<i>Bell!</i>

230
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:58,260
Do not forget me.

231
00:30:00,230 --> 00:30:01,785
<i>Bell!</i>

232
00:30:02,285 --> 00:30:04,285
<i>Bell! Bell!</i>

233
00:30:07,295 --> 00:30:09,965
Bell!
- No, Daddy!

234
00:30:30,610 --> 00:30:33,830
Take me to the castle with the beast.

235
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,627
As quickly as possible.

236
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:29,670
<i>A Life for a rose.</i>

237
00:35:03,470 --> 00:35:08,052
<i>When finally heard shots
clock, Bell was ready to die.</i>

238
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:11,730
<i>But she found the castle of the Beast</i>

239
00:35:11,910 --> 00:35:15,850
<i>a noise, stronger and more beautiful
by bell,</i>

240
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:18,700
<i>that is crawling.</i>

241
00:35:19,420 --> 00:35:21,680
<i>It was the rhythm of his heart.</i>

242
00:35:57,110 --> 00:35:58,990
My name is Bell.

243
00:35:59,090 --> 00:36:02,330
I came
to replace his father's life.

244
00:36:05,740 --> 00:36:07,775
Sit down.

245
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:41,332
Eat.

246
00:36:43,130 --> 00:36:45,380
When you regain strength,

247
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:49,356
you can walk everywhere.

248
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:53,850
But when night falls,
I forbid you to go out of the castle.

249
00:36:54,750 --> 00:36:58,304
If I must die, let it be now.

250
00:37:00,110 --> 00:37:02,457
Bolder than his father.

251
00:37:03,580 --> 00:37:08,570
Every night at this hour
should not be here.

252
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:11,438
Do not even think about running.

253
00:37:11,980 --> 00:37:14,860
Forest will devour.

254
00:37:28,610 --> 00:37:32,230
Should I stop reading?
- No, I want to hear the rest.

255
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:38,350
It is so sad. Itself is nice.
- Yeah, she's all alone.

256
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:43,490
When climbing the ladder
Bell again realized

257
00:37:43,830 --> 00:37:47,850
that throughout his life
will have its own night.

258
00:37:48,270 --> 00:37:50,161
What we did not know

259
00:37:50,298 --> 00:37:53,504
<i>was that her room to the bed
waiting for her "tadomi",</i>

260
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:56,110
<i>small creatures
inhabitants of the castle,</i>

261
00:37:56,260 --> 00:37:59,710
<i>who were to become
her best friends.</i>

262
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:36,885
Am I beautiful?
- Beautiful, smart, gentle...

263
00:40:36,985 --> 00:40:41,292
Most desirable.
- It will appear and your prince.

264
00:40:41,460 --> 00:40:44,415
Then... you'll have to deal with my brother.

265
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:49,470
Here it came.

266
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:20,250
I always knew that my true.

267
00:41:21,980 --> 00:41:23,660
And now I'll eat you.

268
00:41:35,550 --> 00:41:40,920
Get your filthy hands!
- Yes, my friend, without effort,

269
00:41:41,030 --> 00:41:42,550
no reward.

270
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:47,230
Will you never leave her?
- For years, eludes me.

271
00:41:47,340 --> 00:41:51,604
But I know I will hit my hour.
This will be my biggest trophy.

272
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:55,400
After you.

273
00:41:56,170 --> 00:42:01,069
Look what I gave him.
Gold, as the skin of a deer.

274
00:42:02,384 --> 00:42:04,757
Come on. My throat was dry.

275
00:42:04,857 --> 00:42:06,979
I need a drink.

276
00:42:25,790 --> 00:42:28,244
He could still come to me.

277
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:31,600
Wait what?

278
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:51,624
You smell like a beast.

279
00:43:10,020 --> 00:43:13,960
Love,
I want to ask you something.

280
00:43:14,060 --> 00:43:18,090
Anything?
- I want to give up on this deer.

281
00:43:25,970 --> 00:43:30,720
Why?
- With days was hunting her.

282
00:43:32,320 --> 00:43:36,836
I feel terribly lonely here without you.

283
00:43:39,490 --> 00:43:41,160
All right.

284
00:43:42,500 --> 00:43:44,530
But I have a condition.

285
00:43:45,619 --> 00:43:47,646
Grant me a son.

286
00:44:24,080 --> 00:44:29,480
<i>Bell left the room,
hoping Beast is not close.</i>

287
00:44:30,730 --> 00:44:34,057
<i>There sights
which attracts her more.</i>

288
00:44:34,220 --> 00:44:38,840
<i>She wanted to open her own
and to examine the limits of his prison.</i>

289
00:46:49,043 --> 00:46:50,669
Princess.

290
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:54,290
<i>So Bell realized
that many years ago,</i>

291
00:46:54,470 --> 00:46:56,500
<i>and, perhaps,
even centuries ago,</i>

292
00:46:56,670 --> 00:47:01,341
<i>another woman lived, loved...
and died in that damned castle.</i>

293
00:47:01,470 --> 00:47:04,572
"Why are you so sad?"
She asked statue.

294
00:47:04,672 --> 00:47:06,811
"What is your secret?"

295
00:47:06,911 --> 00:47:10,164
Subject to sorrow,
Bell ran to his room,

296
00:47:10,340 --> 00:47:14,906
we wait
for her meeting with the Beast.

297
00:47:16,153 --> 00:47:18,510
Late.

298
00:47:23,530 --> 00:47:28,000
Do you like the new dress?
- I do not come to my room.

299
00:47:28,540 --> 00:47:31,750
Do whatever you want.
- With me going to happen.

300
00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:38,390
Do not look at me. Eat!

301
00:47:38,700 --> 00:47:41,635
And you do not you eat?
- No.

302
00:47:41,735 --> 00:47:43,270
Not in front of you.

303
00:47:43,770 --> 00:47:46,650
Can you talk
or be silent as a child?

304
00:47:46,840 --> 00:47:49,410
You are a child. Daring and naughty.

305
00:47:50,170 --> 00:47:53,190
I love me think
a little fool.

306
00:47:53,290 --> 00:47:55,490
So...
- You talk too much.

307
00:48:03,260 --> 00:48:06,580
I'm sure you like
to fill the void.

308
00:48:08,147 --> 00:48:11,240
Whose is this castle?
- Everything here is mine.

309
00:48:12,230 --> 00:48:15,880
You sound like all men.
It's pretty annoying.

310
00:48:20,030 --> 00:48:22,561
Do you really frustrating
my love?

311
00:48:23,311 --> 00:48:26,492
What do not you like me?

312
00:48:31,400 --> 00:48:33,312
Why are you silent?

313
00:48:33,490 --> 00:48:36,182
Wait a few weeks
your sentence.

314
00:48:36,682 --> 00:48:39,793
Play with me
like a cat with a mouse.

315
00:48:39,893 --> 00:48:45,340
If you accept to be my,
I will fulfill all your desires.

316
00:48:45,440 --> 00:48:49,660
Think beast like you
can have a woman like me?

317
00:48:53,140 --> 00:48:56,055
Looked! Do not look at me!

318
00:48:56,170 --> 00:48:57,780
I know who I am!

319
00:48:58,730 --> 00:49:00,510
PUSH as you like

320
00:49:01,770 --> 00:49:04,193
But it will be mine!

321
00:49:35,010 --> 00:49:39,299
Eat! Do not look at me!
Doing so makes way!

322
00:49:39,399 --> 00:49:41,542
I will teach him good manners!

323
00:50:01,610 --> 00:50:03,342
What's this?

324
00:50:05,350 --> 00:50:07,020
But that's me!

325
00:50:07,820 --> 00:50:10,601
My hidden portrait.

326
00:50:10,760 --> 00:50:12,780
What a wonderful gift!

327
00:50:22,110 --> 00:50:25,749
I wonder which of you
made this beautiful doll?

328
00:50:31,251 --> 00:50:33,445
Where are you hiding?

329
00:50:33,545 --> 00:50:35,852
Exit will not eat you.

330
00:50:44,350 --> 00:50:48,014
I'll leave you here.
This will always be with me.

331
00:51:57,080 --> 00:51:58,660
friends

332
00:51:59,610 --> 00:52:01,220
Today is a big day.

333
00:52:02,610 --> 00:52:05,910
Our kingdom finally
will get a successor.

334
00:52:14,570 --> 00:52:16,372
And you, madam?

335
00:52:16,499 --> 00:52:19,324
Do you want to make
we successor?

336
00:52:19,490 --> 00:52:24,498
For starters, you do Kingdom.
- Hopefully not like his father.

337
00:52:29,290 --> 00:52:33,928
What do you think?
- For the first time we met.

338
00:52:34,028 --> 00:52:35,831
To the river.

339
00:52:37,250 --> 00:52:41,660
You get close to the shore
and pretended to undress.

340
00:52:44,010 --> 00:52:45,740
It seemed to me like you're drowning.

341
00:52:47,610 --> 00:52:49,500
Swim better than you.

342
00:52:54,680 --> 00:52:56,737
What if we go back to our room?

343
00:53:00,080 --> 00:53:02,050
Do not forget your promise.

344
00:53:03,740 --> 00:53:05,280
What?

345
00:53:07,730 --> 00:53:09,270
Golden deer.

346
00:53:45,870 --> 00:53:49,230
<i>woke up
Bell decided to examine the castle.</i>

347
00:53:49,670 --> 00:53:52,680
<i>She was determined to solve
the secret of the Beast.</i>

348
00:53:53,580 --> 00:53:56,570
<i>She was lost in the beautiful corridors</i>

349
00:53:56,710 --> 00:54:01,797
<i>feeling that is always followed.</i>

350
00:56:16,290 --> 00:56:18,837
I apologize for last night.

351
00:56:20,130 --> 00:56:24,889
You're right.
Without you here too deserted.

352
00:56:27,640 --> 00:56:29,666
Do you like my gifts?

353
00:56:31,820 --> 00:56:35,060
Why are you silent?
- I miss my family.

354
00:56:36,870 --> 00:56:39,640
Forget them.
They no longer exist.

355
00:56:39,760 --> 00:56:42,660
I wish I was like you
not to think about the past.

356
00:56:42,900 --> 00:56:46,157
But I can not give up.
- I have nothing.

357
00:56:46,320 --> 00:56:50,070
Nothing. You are right.

358
00:56:51,870 --> 00:56:53,750
I suggest you deal.

359
00:56:55,660 --> 00:57:00,640
A few hours with my family.
- Against what?

360
00:57:01,960 --> 00:57:03,460
A dance.

361
00:57:06,220 --> 00:57:07,870
In return I want to see them.

362
00:57:08,620 --> 00:57:13,340
What if you lie?
- I will not transgress his word.

363
00:57:35,130 --> 00:57:38,367
And so. Here we go.

364
00:58:23,170 --> 00:58:25,665
Are not you afraid to dance with me?

365
00:58:27,650 --> 00:58:29,190
Do not get distracted.

366
00:59:59,825 --> 01:00:01,695
Do you love me?

367
01:00:05,960 --> 01:00:09,460
We had a deal.
Hold your promise.

368
01:00:10,090 --> 01:00:13,590
For a long time I did not promise
anybody anything.

369
01:00:15,880 --> 01:00:18,141
Walk with clothes prince

370
01:00:18,500 --> 01:00:22,930
You think you.
But it turned violent and lonely beast.

371
01:00:23,080 --> 01:00:26,300
I try to spell,
but disgust me.

372
01:00:26,400 --> 01:00:28,179
Never have me!

373
01:03:29,724 --> 01:03:32,165
Now you know who I am.

374
01:03:33,500 --> 01:03:37,220
Tell me again that they detest.
Tell me!

375
01:04:35,910 --> 01:04:39,711
I'll let you see your family
last time.

376
01:04:40,256 --> 01:04:44,344
Really? Will you allow me?

377
01:04:47,100 --> 01:04:49,160
I'll give you one day.

378
01:04:49,770 --> 01:04:53,240
No more. Dress.

379
01:05:24,070 --> 01:05:26,788
Give me your hand.
- Which one?

380
01:05:27,020 --> 01:05:29,330
I do not know. Does not matter. Left.

381
01:05:29,890 --> 01:05:33,510
I'll ring you put it?
- Still, at least for a while.

382
01:05:34,830 --> 01:05:36,380
Listen.

383
01:05:40,250 --> 01:05:42,320
You know the power of this water.

384
01:05:43,070 --> 01:05:45,280
In order not to hurt yourself.

385
01:05:47,620 --> 01:05:50,920
If anything happens.
- Nothing will happen.

386
01:05:51,570 --> 01:05:53,220
Must be prepared.

387
01:05:59,070 --> 01:06:04,150
Bell, if you do not come back...
- I will kill everyone.

388
01:06:05,140 --> 01:06:09,190
No. Die.

389
01:06:14,720 --> 01:06:18,193
I'll come tomorrow. At this time.

390
01:06:37,860 --> 01:06:40,930
Who's there?
Hold on target!

391
01:06:45,330 --> 01:06:47,140
Bell!

392
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:16,940
Everywhere in disarray.

393
01:07:17,130 --> 01:07:20,080
What do you do with these weapons?
- Ask Maxim.

394
01:07:20,190 --> 01:07:23,950
Shut up and go back to his post.
- Go back?

395
01:07:24,050 --> 01:07:26,968
For your general you think?
- Enough, enough.

396
01:07:27,068 --> 01:07:29,690
There you go again?
- Do not defend him.

397
01:07:30,030 --> 01:07:33,190
All day hiding in fear.
- Me, I'm scared?

398
01:07:33,290 --> 01:07:35,920
Stop it! Stop it!
- What is it?

399
01:07:36,090 --> 01:07:37,690
Are you all mad?

400
01:07:41,690 --> 01:07:45,567
Come on up.
Everything will be fine.

401
01:07:45,680 --> 01:07:48,844
You really will sell
for debts of Maxim?

402
01:07:48,944 --> 01:07:51,552
We will board the ship
sweaty sailors.

403
01:07:52,460 --> 01:07:54,623
And I wash the floors in the hold?

404
01:07:55,030 --> 01:07:58,974
Tell them that fear the sea
And it's not for the hosts.

405
01:07:59,074 --> 01:08:00,874
Right.

406
01:08:02,540 --> 01:08:04,540
Ann.

407
01:08:04,640 --> 01:08:06,220
Clotilde.

408
01:08:07,520 --> 01:08:11,640
I'm back.
- Clotilde, are you seeing the same?

409
01:08:11,740 --> 01:08:14,671
The ghost of Belle came to us.

410
01:08:14,850 --> 01:08:18,784
All in red, bathed in blood.
- Do not dream, my dear.

411
01:08:19,420 --> 01:08:23,238
I really am.
I came to say goodbye.

412
01:08:23,400 --> 01:08:27,400
Even dead is more beautiful than us.
- Just look at what waist.

413
01:08:27,500 --> 01:08:32,370
Know that you will love forever.
- And we you. Just thinking about you.

414
01:08:32,480 --> 01:08:37,032
She forbade me to go to your room.
- What have you done?

415
01:08:37,132 --> 01:08:39,423
Did not I forbid.

416
01:08:42,370 --> 01:08:43,920
Where's Dad?

417
01:08:44,050 --> 01:08:47,695
After you left,
He lay down and did not want to wake up.

418
01:08:52,940 --> 01:08:55,092
Where is this dress?

419
01:09:01,230 --> 01:09:02,969
Dad?

420
01:09:08,230 --> 01:09:10,531
This is me.

421
01:09:10,631 --> 01:09:12,631
Bell.

422
01:09:14,031 --> 01:09:15,531
I'm here.

423
01:09:19,620 --> 01:09:21,220
I'm back.

424
01:09:23,880 --> 01:09:25,570
He promised me.

425
01:09:28,743 --> 01:09:30,312
Dad.

426
01:09:31,112 --> 01:09:32,712
Dad.

427
01:09:42,210 --> 01:09:44,240
This is a very valuable stone.

428
01:09:46,330 --> 01:09:49,320
Probably from the castle.
- No stealing.

429
01:09:49,420 --> 01:09:52,630
This is our chance, Tristan.
- I'd rather live.

430
01:11:21,270 --> 01:11:24,857
Watch her?shake her hips.
How swell her belly

431
01:11:25,690 --> 01:11:27,990
Almost smell the aroma her

432
01:11:28,090 --> 01:11:31,070
The time has come.
- Mine is, okay?

433
01:14:00,490 --> 01:14:03,550
I am a mountain nymph.

434
01:14:06,957 --> 01:14:10,000
I could convert
in different creatures.

435
01:14:11,935 --> 01:14:15,042
I wanted to know what
they called - love.

436
01:14:18,690 --> 01:14:21,189
I found it in you.

437
01:14:21,290 --> 01:14:23,881
My love.
- Forgive me.

438
01:14:34,340 --> 01:14:36,025
Dad.

439
01:14:40,655 --> 01:14:42,210
God of the forest.

440
01:14:45,360 --> 01:14:47,216
Spare my favorite.

441
01:14:48,580 --> 01:14:52,030
He gave daughter
eternal love.

442
01:14:52,960 --> 01:14:56,255
Dad... spare him.

443
01:15:36,930 --> 01:15:40,215
<i>thunderous voice was heard from heaven.</i>

444
01:15:40,405 --> 01:15:44,030
<i>"To punish her?daughter,
will become a beast. "</i>

445
01:15:44,215 --> 01:15:46,614
<i>Only one woman will be able to save you.</i>

446
01:15:46,715 --> 01:15:51,274
<i>But who wants to love you?
Will curse hanging over you forever.</i>

447
01:16:08,480 --> 01:16:12,661
Will avenge Bell.
Will save her.

448
01:16:12,950 --> 01:16:14,710
She'll understand.

449
01:16:15,450 --> 01:16:17,749
You're not happened brother?

450
01:16:27,830 --> 01:16:30,040
What are you doing here, bunnies?

451
01:16:30,500 --> 01:16:34,260
Lest they be lost?
Look.

452
01:16:34,430 --> 01:16:38,335
Arranged the boys,
to get acquainted with your sisters.

453
01:16:39,930 --> 01:16:43,490
I suggest you deal.
- That what deals do you have?

454
01:16:43,670 --> 01:16:45,220
I can not wait to hear.

455
01:16:47,190 --> 01:16:48,730
Look.

456
01:16:49,880 --> 01:16:54,610
The abandoned castle's Get all
treasure, but left the beast to me.

457
01:16:59,970 --> 01:17:04,624
Stone like this how much?
- State.

458
01:17:05,980 --> 01:17:10,811
Can not fool me, bunny.
This is your last chance.

459
01:17:11,140 --> 01:17:13,265
Follow me with men.

460
01:17:15,750 --> 01:17:17,400
Do what it says.

461
01:17:23,790 --> 01:17:25,867
"More than anything in the world. "

462
01:17:36,580 --> 01:17:39,249
<i>And they went through the magical forest.</i>

463
01:17:39,349 --> 01:17:42,153
<i>Perdyugas would find
coveted treasure.</i>

464
01:17:42,253 --> 01:17:45,650
<i>and his people are dreaming
How will you share it.</i>

465
01:17:45,800 --> 01:17:50,760
<i>Astrid He looked and wondered
if he prefers love or wealth.</i>

466
01:17:50,930 --> 01:17:55,610
<i>Sometimes the human mind is troubled.
All ran without thinking.</i>

467
01:17:55,780 --> 01:17:59,780
<i>Meanwhile Bell
dreaming of the prince became a beast.</i>

468
01:17:59,950 --> 01:18:02,958
<i>And suddenly,
something if she nudges.</i>

469
01:18:35,810 --> 01:18:37,420
My child!

470
01:18:41,770 --> 01:18:43,656
So I missed!

471
01:18:45,510 --> 01:18:47,150
Bell!

472
01:18:49,710 --> 01:18:54,560
Miracle! Anne! Clotilde!

473
01:18:55,200 --> 01:18:56,860
I'm so scared.

474
01:18:59,360 --> 01:19:01,581
Something in you has changed.

475
01:19:02,110 --> 01:19:03,932
Your eyes.

476
01:19:05,700 --> 01:19:09,295
And your voice...
- I have to go, Dad.

477
01:19:10,622 --> 01:19:12,820
Do not be late.

478
01:19:19,320 --> 01:19:23,377
What a miracle!
- The happiest day of my life!

479
01:19:24,490 --> 01:19:27,670
Stop, will you crush so
nitwits me.

480
01:19:59,420 --> 01:20:01,370
Do you feel anything?

481
01:20:02,200 --> 01:20:05,216
Danger. Everywhere is

482
01:20:12,400 --> 01:20:14,390
With all do.

483
01:20:18,490 --> 01:20:20,080
Come on.

484
01:20:20,220 --> 01:20:22,290
You three west.

485
01:20:23,030 --> 01:20:25,740
Others take the east.

486
01:20:26,380 --> 01:20:29,270
And you left before me.

487
01:21:53,145 --> 01:21:54,755
<i>Astrid!</i>

488
01:21:55,460 --> 01:21:57,570
<i>Astrid, come here!</i>

489
01:22:13,700 --> 01:22:16,541
Brother, I have to hurry.

490
01:22:18,450 --> 01:22:20,588
Maxim took the horse.

491
01:22:20,720 --> 01:22:24,280
I know I should have told you earlier,
forgive me, Bell.

492
01:23:03,200 --> 01:23:07,150
I hate not about me.
Where were you?

493
01:23:07,280 --> 01:23:10,770
If I tell you to leave immediately
will you follow?

494
01:23:12,120 --> 01:23:15,420
Gold's
- This arrow is powerful.

495
01:23:15,550 --> 01:23:18,727
I feel that there is much more wealth.

496
01:23:18,827 --> 01:23:21,705
If you worship will have everything.

497
01:23:21,900 --> 01:23:23,844
Open your eyes.

498
01:23:24,010 --> 01:23:26,761
We found that,
we've always sought.

499
01:23:32,591 --> 01:23:36,630
How do I know you will not come back
and take my treasure?

500
01:23:36,780 --> 01:23:40,930
If you do not believe me,
Trust my cards.

501
01:23:41,030 --> 01:23:43,770
What have you seen?
- Death.

502
01:23:44,620 --> 01:23:48,606
Yours or mine?
- Which do you prefer?

503
01:23:48,706 --> 01:23:50,734
Neither, dear.

504
01:23:52,120 --> 01:23:55,600
And if you're not sure about anything
to say that he is.

505
01:23:55,740 --> 01:23:58,180
He will die tonight.

506
01:24:05,650 --> 01:24:07,170
Well?

507
01:24:07,410 --> 01:24:10,090
This gate will not open itself.

508
01:25:05,700 --> 01:25:07,840
Abandoned castle you?

509
01:25:50,680 --> 01:25:54,480
Relax, bastards.
This castle has many floors.

510
01:26:13,360 --> 01:26:15,180
To seek another path.

511
01:26:16,810 --> 01:26:20,606
I lost the ribbon on his way to the castle.
So, it is not far away.

512
01:26:23,360 --> 01:26:24,920
Bell, what are you doing?

513
01:26:25,200 --> 01:26:26,790
Bell stop that.

514
01:26:28,110 --> 01:26:30,970
Bell back! Return, Bell!

515
01:26:33,510 --> 01:26:35,160
Please, Bell, come back!

516
01:26:35,670 --> 01:26:37,220
Bell!

517
01:27:14,960 --> 01:27:16,620
God of the forest,

518
01:27:17,520 --> 01:27:19,100
listen.

519
01:27:21,310 --> 01:27:23,372
Let me get to it.

520
01:27:23,472 --> 01:27:25,691
This is my only desire.

521
01:27:27,252 --> 01:27:29,061
The only thing I want.

522
01:28:10,750 --> 01:28:13,950
Here's our gold.
There was no one inside.

523
01:28:14,920 --> 01:28:18,570
Do not spoil the holiday.
I am rich.

524
01:28:19,423 --> 01:28:21,840
I can fulfill your every desire.

525
01:28:21,950 --> 01:28:26,346
I just want to be together.
- I do not solve your cards.

526
01:28:26,446 --> 01:28:28,144
And I.

527
01:29:42,500 --> 01:29:44,734
What is it?
Why is he screaming?

528
01:32:10,525 --> 01:32:13,398
Where are our brothers?
- Up to the gate with Perdyugas.

529
01:32:19,464 --> 01:32:21,307
Kill them!

530
01:32:45,400 --> 01:32:47,056
Maxim!

531
01:32:52,813 --> 01:32:55,082
Save yourself.
Bell asked for forgiveness.

532
01:32:55,182 --> 01:32:57,142
No.
- I said get out!

533
01:32:57,555 --> 01:33:00,375
I'll ask her.

534
01:33:11,335 --> 01:33:12,851
Stop!

535
01:33:23,897 --> 01:33:25,648
Hello, little one.

536
01:33:26,170 --> 01:33:27,815
Now you will help me.

537
01:33:35,320 --> 01:33:36,920
Drop it!

538
01:33:39,038 --> 01:33:41,370
What are you?

539
01:33:41,540 --> 01:33:45,760
Leo? Big cat?
- The one who will tear.

540
01:33:46,060 --> 01:33:48,396
Purr as you want.

541
01:33:48,580 --> 01:33:53,050
But if you do not want to kill your doll,
will you let me go.

542
01:34:29,480 --> 01:34:31,130
I beg you!

543
01:34:32,370 --> 01:34:34,690
Remember that you were a man!

544
01:34:35,770 --> 01:34:39,150
And among these thieves
are my brothers.

545
01:34:40,962 --> 01:34:43,015
Most importantly, I'm here.

546
01:34:43,215 --> 01:34:45,028
I will not abandon you.

547
01:35:32,914 --> 01:35:34,750
Help me!

548
01:35:44,125 --> 01:35:46,569
Come on, quick!

549
01:36:48,820 --> 01:36:51,235
Do not leave me!

550
01:37:04,815 --> 01:37:07,713
Darling, you waits fate
worse than mine.

551
01:37:23,590 --> 01:37:25,670
Close the door!

552
01:37:26,090 --> 01:37:27,950
Hurry!

553
01:37:33,520 --> 01:37:35,155
Come on, quick!

554
01:38:04,120 --> 01:38:05,900
He's not breathing.

555
01:38:13,725 --> 01:38:16,367
Stay in the water.
Brothers, come on.

556
01:39:15,210 --> 01:39:17,820
Late for dinner.

557
01:39:22,110 --> 01:39:24,510
Are you sorry?

558
01:39:26,690 --> 01:39:28,220
Bell.

559
01:39:29,470 --> 01:39:33,330
What do you think?
Given enough patience.

560
01:39:34,710 --> 01:39:36,560
If you were used to.

561
01:39:38,320 --> 01:39:39,920
Could be me...

562
01:39:41,460 --> 01:39:43,546
love it.

563
01:39:46,858 --> 01:39:48,878
But I already love you.

564
01:42:13,810 --> 01:42:15,620
<i>story is over.</i>

565
01:42:16,310 --> 01:42:18,170
<i>time for sleep.</i>

566
01:42:19,679 --> 01:42:21,490
<i>Come on.</i>

567
01:42:31,970 --> 01:42:34,940
His brothers and sisters?
What happened to them?

568
01:42:35,500 --> 01:42:39,540
<i>all went to town.
Her brother has issued the book.</i>

569
01:42:39,780 --> 01:42:44,830
<i>and her sister is married to twins
and never able to distinguish them.</i>

570
01:42:44,980 --> 01:42:48,865
So all together?
And their father?

571
01:42:49,050 --> 01:42:51,220
He opened a flower shop.

572
01:42:51,400 --> 01:42:54,841
Is he?
- Yes, he is.

573
01:42:57,524 --> 01:42:59,143
Sweet dreams.

574
01:43:02,844 --> 01:43:05,623
Mom.
- Spink, honey.
