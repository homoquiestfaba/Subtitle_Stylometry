00:00:58,428 --> 00:00:59,080
Mister Brodie?

4
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:02,880
Alright alright

5
00:01:08,169 --> 00:01:09,040
Mister Brodie?

6
00:01:09,657 --> 00:01:10,400
Is he there?

7
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:20,640
Frank Brodie?

8
00:01:21,463 --> 00:01:22,440
What are the charges?

9
00:01:23,888 --> 00:01:25,038
Name is Scott Davis,

10
00:01:25,208 --> 00:01:27,240
there's a plane that's gone
down on San Miguel Island.

11
00:01:27,692 --> 00:01:29,176
Locals tell me
you're the man I need,

12
00:01:29,424 --> 00:01:31,905
I understand that you used
to lead expeditions on

13
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:40,720
Mister Brodie?

14
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:47,082
I'm told you know that
island better than anyone.

15
00:01:47,733 --> 00:01:48,626
If we left right now,

16
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:50,691
we could have those
people out by nightfall.

17
00:01:52,945 --> 00:01:54,034
We've got a boat now.

18
00:01:54,873 --> 00:01:55,988
Now you're trespassing.

19
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:01,268
Drop the gun.

20
00:02:13,882 --> 00:02:14,550
Mister Brodie,

21
00:02:14,862 --> 00:02:17,131
this is a crisis situation,
and we need your help.

22
00:02:17,296 --> 00:02:19,960
you know that I used to lead
expeditions there, right?

23
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:23,643
Mister Brodie

24
00:02:25,038 --> 00:02:27,947
Why did you have a pilot fly over
an island and restricted airspace?

25
00:02:27,978 --> 00:02:29,766
Is that why you
can't go to the Federales?

26
00:02:30,549 --> 00:02:31,840
That's not relevant
to this mission.

27
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:34,280
You don't want to
go to that island.

28
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:37,600
You got no idea what
you're getting yourself into.

29
00:02:37,871 --> 00:02:39,838
Look, I have important
people on that island,

30
00:02:39,874 --> 00:02:41,122
and every minute
we waste talking...

31
00:02:41,146 --> 00:02:41,737
They are dead.

32
00:02:43,208 --> 00:02:44,240
Not until I say so.

33
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:49,266
If you change your mind,
you know where to find us.

34
00:02:51,322 --> 00:02:52,580
Nice place you got here.

35
00:02:53,589 --> 00:02:54,129
Thanks.

36
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,680
Told you he would come,
they say he's crazy.

37
00:02:58,480 --> 00:02:59,916
That's what they call
the guy around here,

38
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:00,680
we'll take our chances.

39
00:03:16,369 --> 00:03:17,800
Of course, out of range.

40
00:03:18,741 --> 00:03:20,186
My father is going to kill me,

41
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:22,080
I wanted to announce this by noon.

42
00:03:24,490 --> 00:03:27,200
Mister Deutsch,
you really should stay still.

43
00:03:28,797 --> 00:03:29,790
You're probably in shock,

44
00:03:29,850 --> 00:03:31,308
you probably hurt
worse than you know.

45
00:03:31,332 --> 00:03:33,488
Good, if that's the case
shoot me now.

46
00:03:34,574 --> 00:03:36,734
Look, I'm going to go
try and find us some water.

47
00:03:36,831 --> 00:03:38,631
We should be okay
if we stay hydrated.

48
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:40,453
Excuse me, hello?

49
00:03:40,730 --> 00:03:43,440
I think we've got a slightly
bigger problem than whose thirsty.

50
00:03:43,905 --> 00:03:45,318
Help is on the way,
Miss Cunningham,

51
00:03:45,354 --> 00:03:46,280
there's no need to worry,

52
00:03:46,497 --> 00:03:47,514
I called in the Mayday

53
00:03:47,562 --> 00:03:49,010
we have a rescue
 beacon working.

54
00:03:49,243 --> 00:03:50,688
They'll be here in a couple of hours.

55
00:03:52,878 --> 00:03:54,160
I'll give you one and a half.

56
00:03:55,873 --> 00:03:56,481
What?

57
00:03:56,788 --> 00:03:58,081
This sucks, man.

58
00:03:58,886 --> 00:04:00,290
You don't know my father,

59
00:04:00,767 --> 00:04:02,197
he's going to think I made
this whole thing up,

60
00:04:02,221 --> 00:04:03,240
just to avoid work.

61
00:05:35,081 --> 00:05:36,800
Let's turn the gain around
on the feed if we can.

62
00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:39,388
Okay, that's good.

63
00:05:41,650 --> 00:05:43,060
Let's see what we've got.

64
00:05:46,916 --> 00:05:47,691
Bingo,

65
00:05:47,969 --> 00:05:49,556
this hasn't been
surveyed recently,

66
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:52,080
no maps available.

67
00:05:55,170 --> 00:05:55,920
Interesting.

68
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:00,473
How the hell are we going to
get in there without a guide?

69
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:04,188
This place has no maps,

70
00:06:05,107 --> 00:06:05,898
going in blind.

71
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,040
Mister Davis?

72
00:06:08,950 --> 00:06:09,840
Hi Tara.

73
00:06:10,810 --> 00:06:11,600
I'm ready.

74
00:06:13,465 --> 00:06:15,028
Here's the medical kit you asked for.

75
00:06:15,237 --> 00:06:16,268
Just throw it up front for now.

76
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:19,170
Buena Suerte,
this is Rescue Center,

77
00:06:19,383 --> 00:06:21,138
we are still showing
a code red alert.

78
00:06:21,574 --> 00:06:23,400
Time from impact is now 2 hours,

79
00:06:23,987 --> 00:06:26,120
probability of survival
has decreased 20%.

80
00:06:26,708 --> 00:06:27,999
What are we waiting for?

81
00:06:28,256 --> 00:06:30,280
Remember that it's for 8 hours,

82
00:06:30,459 --> 00:06:32,828
then it's going to be double,
If we do it now.

83
00:06:33,599 --> 00:06:34,428
Then shove off.

84
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:35,720
Okay.

85
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,640
Forgot to mention
what this gig pays.

86
00:06:44,850 --> 00:06:45,680
You're late.

87
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:49,198
Dug me.

88
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,760
Brodie this isn't an arms shipment.

89
00:07:06,206 --> 00:07:07,160
Who do you work for?

90
00:07:08,469 --> 00:07:11,086
I handle special assignments
for the man who's buying the island,

91
00:07:11,312 --> 00:07:12,560
his daughter was on that plane.

92
00:07:14,450 --> 00:07:15,480
He didn't know what's on it.

93
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:19,460
He's turning it into a resort,
that's all he told me.

94
00:07:23,184 --> 00:07:24,160
What do you got for weapons?

95
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:25,360
Weapons?

96
00:07:26,572 --> 00:07:27,720
This is a rescue mission.

97
00:07:28,452 --> 00:07:31,990
I got a SATCOM link,
MREs, GPS, thermal recon,

98
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:33,000
We are set.

99
00:07:35,170 --> 00:07:37,840
That island was abandoned
and put off limits for a reason.

100
00:07:40,942 --> 00:07:41,920
They didn't tell you any of this?

101
00:07:43,424 --> 00:07:44,308
Animal testing.

102
00:07:48,228 --> 00:07:50,331
Man, you must have
really pissed somebody off.

103
00:07:51,150 --> 00:07:53,188
Because they just sent you
on a suicide mission.

104
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:07,230
Buena Suerte this is Rescue

105
00:08:07,290 --> 00:08:08,868
we're now approaching
a restricted area

106
00:08:08,892 --> 00:08:10,098
outside San Miguel Island.

107
00:08:10,194 --> 00:08:12,054
Start your sweep over target sector,

108
00:08:12,222 --> 00:08:14,440
continue heading 2 3 0.

109
00:08:20,437 --> 00:08:21,428
Mister Davis,

110
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:22,880
how's this?

111
00:08:23,449 --> 00:08:24,598
Got it down to
the bare minimum.

112
00:08:24,634 --> 00:08:25,938
That's going to
slow us down.

113
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:29,386
I assure you, I can handle my
own under any circumstance.

114
00:08:29,591 --> 00:08:31,318
Tara has worked
with the village doctor,

115
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:33,308
she'll come in handy.
That's fine.

116
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:35,200
We need a medic Brodie.

117
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:40,748
signor Davis,

118
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:43,040
this is as far
as I can go, see?

119
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:45,599
I wait here,
I'm sorry,

120
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:51,360
Brodie.

121
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:00,485
Brodie come on.

122
00:09:12,650 --> 00:09:14,202
Maybe we should
go look for him.

123
00:09:14,531 --> 00:09:15,868
He'll be back like he said,

124
00:09:15,892 --> 00:09:17,706
we'll be out of this
before we know it.

125
00:09:17,828 --> 00:09:21,469
Look while we're waiting,
why don't we just finish this up?

126
00:09:21,716 --> 00:09:24,068
All you got to do is sign
this inspection agreement,

127
00:09:24,092 --> 00:09:25,101
and the island is yours.

128
00:09:25,543 --> 00:09:27,030
I want to talk to my father first

129
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:28,028
Your father...

130
00:09:28,088 --> 00:09:30,682
I know your father
trusts you Kelsey,

131
00:09:30,706 --> 00:09:33,203
and this deal was almost
finished anyway.

132
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:36,080
At a time like this and
you're trying to close the deal?

133
00:09:38,695 --> 00:09:39,568
What the hell is that?

134
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:47,560
Run

135
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:52,360
I thought you said they
were no animals on this island.

136
00:09:53,339 --> 00:09:54,920
I thought you said they
were no animals.

137
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:58,000
You can't just leave me here.

138
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:03,388
John
Hey

139
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:07,120
Lg secured,
recon back here at 9:37

140
00:10:07,144 --> 00:10:08,926
Code word and frequency the same?

141
00:10:08,950 --> 00:10:11,786
Everything goes tight,
back in 2 hours I'll buy.

142
00:10:11,848 --> 00:10:12,760
I heard that.

143
00:10:13,276 --> 00:10:15,880
Everything's packed,
all ready when you are.

144
00:10:17,050 --> 00:10:18,240
Kovacs will stay behind,

145
00:10:18,232 --> 00:10:19,988
he's got the SATCOM,
we'll replay by walking.

146
00:10:20,996 --> 00:10:21,960
He has a gun?

147
00:10:23,484 --> 00:10:24,552
There is a speargun in the truck.

148
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:31,680
Kovacs?

149
00:10:41,128 --> 00:10:42,320
You know how to
use one of these?

150
00:10:44,586 --> 00:10:45,320
For what?

151
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:47,760
You could kill
a rhino with this thing.

152
00:10:48,745 --> 00:10:51,480
No actually you couldn't
make sure it's loaded.

153
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:55,160
Try to hit what you aim at.

154
00:10:57,730 --> 00:10:58,480
Thanks,

155
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:00,880
I guess.

156
00:11:06,215 --> 00:11:07,200
Do you know what that is?

157
00:11:09,792 --> 00:11:10,308
Nothing

158
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:13,280
storage shed.

159
00:11:18,325 --> 00:11:19,880
All right, stay close
and follow me,

160
00:11:20,503 --> 00:11:22,150
you're not separate
from the group for any reason,

161
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:22,868
is that clear?

162
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:26,040
Brodie in this mission,
you're an advisor okay?

163
00:11:26,730 --> 00:11:28,800
Never leave anyone
on point without gun.

164
00:11:59,810 --> 00:12:01,028
Mister Davis

165
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:07,400
I think this was
a gazelle or something.

166
00:12:10,690 --> 00:12:11,428
Yeah but,

167
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:14,505
this wasn't.

168
00:12:51,370 --> 00:12:52,720
Brodie, what are you doing?

169
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:55,880
Thought I saw something.

170
00:12:59,117 --> 00:13:00,870
We're going to have to
cut through the jungle.

171
00:13:03,395 --> 00:13:05,080
You said the river was shorter.

172
00:13:06,082 --> 00:13:07,160
The other way is faster.

173
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:10,480
The other way being
the road that I wanted to take.

174
00:13:25,850 --> 00:13:28,126
Send your family
to San Miguel Island,

175
00:13:28,198 --> 00:13:29,548
It'll be the time of their lives,

176
00:13:29,572 --> 00:13:31,040
they'll never want to come back.

177
00:13:31,921 --> 00:13:33,640
In fact, you'll never
hear from them again,

178
00:13:34,132 --> 00:13:35,600
I can see the brochure now.

179
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:37,628
Listen I'll drop the price,

180
00:13:37,652 --> 00:13:39,948
and I'll hire somebody
to go through the place.

181
00:13:40,065 --> 00:13:40,470
Like who?

182
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:42,348
I don't know,
like the marines or something,

183
00:13:42,529 --> 00:13:43,026
Right?

184
00:13:43,297 --> 00:13:45,468
An American oil company is
going to pay the government

185
00:13:45,492 --> 00:13:47,160
to exterminate an island in Mexico.

186
00:13:47,185 --> 00:13:48,202
Yeah, it wouldn't
be the first time.

187
00:13:53,431 --> 00:13:54,400
Anybody there?

188
00:13:56,044 --> 00:13:56,794
Hello?

189
00:14:00,166 --> 00:14:01,809
Just the wind.
There is no wind.

190
00:14:03,464 --> 00:14:04,400
Let's go back.

191
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:23,240
How far?

192
00:14:24,209 --> 00:14:26,200
I figure about a kilometre.

193
00:14:27,047 --> 00:14:28,592
Kilometre, give or take,

194
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:31,107
We won't make it before dark,

195
00:14:31,618 --> 00:14:33,796
I guess we will,
we're making good time.

196
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:38,120
Eddie, do you copy?

197
00:14:39,206 --> 00:14:40,514
We're going to
need the infrared,

198
00:14:40,861 --> 00:14:42,457
Looks like we might
not make it before dark,

199
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:44,520
Eddie?
Right here, sir.

200
00:14:47,637 --> 00:14:48,557
Radio works

201
00:14:59,650 --> 00:15:00,484
What was that?

202
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:15,160
Look at the size of that thing.

203
00:15:21,207 --> 00:15:22,068
Do you see anything?

204
00:15:22,529 --> 00:15:22,960
No.

205
00:15:25,736 --> 00:15:26,600
Let's go.

206
00:15:31,784 --> 00:15:34,240
Mister Davis,
just in case.

207
00:15:35,513 --> 00:15:36,160
Thanks, Eddie.

208
00:15:36,893 --> 00:15:37,713
Don't thank me,

209
00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:41,040
thank god that wasn't us.

210
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:05,698
Base to point,

211
00:16:06,499 --> 00:16:07,400
Davis do you copy?

212
00:16:07,490 --> 00:16:07,988
What?

213
00:16:08,576 --> 00:16:09,988
You are going the wrong way guys.

214
00:16:10,236 --> 00:16:10,945
Say again.

215
00:16:11,646 --> 00:16:13,108
We have a new fix on the transmitter,

216
00:16:13,304 --> 00:16:14,920
behind you,
not in front of you.

217
00:16:15,611 --> 00:16:17,561
We must turn around,
you're moving off course guys.

218
00:16:17,991 --> 00:16:20,280
That's impossible,
we had our position locked in.

219
00:16:22,447 --> 00:16:23,880
Kovacs what's
the new course heading?

220
00:16:24,230 --> 00:16:25,628
Change course to

221
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:31,640
that's impossible.

222
00:16:31,782 --> 00:16:33,698
What is it?
It's moving.

223
00:16:33,844 --> 00:16:34,880
It's not moving.

224
00:16:35,350 --> 00:16:36,640
It's moving, sir.

225
00:16:38,111 --> 00:16:40,218
All right I want you
to do a thermal recon scan,

226
00:16:40,254 --> 00:16:42,098
set your coordinates
to the initial point of contact.

227
00:16:42,371 --> 00:16:43,121
Do you copy? Over.

228
00:16:43,284 --> 00:16:43,908
Copy that,

229
00:16:44,269 --> 00:16:47,129
standing by for thermal recon
launch, airborne in 30 seconds.

230
00:17:05,454 --> 00:17:06,859
Okay, we have contact,

231
00:17:07,436 --> 00:17:10,280
I read two subjects
at ground zero,

232
00:17:10,304 --> 00:17:12,680
about half a mile
east of your position.

233
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:14,065
Check that.

234
00:17:14,237 --> 00:17:16,760
There should be three,
well now I read five.

235
00:17:17,531 --> 00:17:18,040
Five?

236
00:17:20,728 --> 00:17:21,839
That's not possible.

237
00:17:24,029 --> 00:17:24,908
Well it looks like,

238
00:17:25,571 --> 00:17:26,668
there is at least 30 of them.

239
00:17:36,993 --> 00:17:37,960
It's getting dark.

240
00:17:39,912 --> 00:17:41,281
Do we have a survival plan?

241
00:17:41,428 --> 00:17:43,200
If we do, it's in a plane.

242
00:17:45,189 --> 00:17:46,080
You think it's safe?

243
00:17:48,828 --> 00:17:49,748
Something moved,

244
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:52,160
there

245
00:17:56,122 --> 00:17:57,640
Maybe we should be able to fire.

246
00:17:58,706 --> 00:18:01,005
All right, I've got the survival kit.

247
00:18:03,150 --> 00:18:05,188
god, wish I had my nine millimetre

248
00:18:05,212 --> 00:18:06,760
Yeah, carry a gun?

249
00:18:06,936 --> 00:18:10,140
Yeah, I carry a gun,
I didn't think I needed it here.

250
00:18:15,407 --> 00:18:16,920
What, is that noise?

251
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:18,440
I don't know,

252
00:18:18,833 --> 00:18:20,200
I'm going to find out.

253
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:24,730
Okay, we got
a first aid kit

254
00:18:25,033 --> 00:18:25,480
What are you doing?

255
00:18:25,543 --> 00:18:28,040
Leave us alone
you bastards.

256
00:18:34,936 --> 00:18:36,200
Contact 10 o'clock

257
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:39,440
30 degrees north.

258
00:18:39,574 --> 00:18:40,240
This is it,

259
00:18:40,994 --> 00:18:41,800
they're alive.

260
00:18:43,034 --> 00:18:44,160
Why don't you follow me now?

261
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:48,920
Anywhere

262
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:08,400
What the hell is that?

263
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:11,080
Let's get in the plane.

264
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:24,770
Heads up people,
I see the wreckage.

265
00:19:26,243 --> 00:19:27,360
It's two survivors.

266
00:19:32,930 --> 00:19:34,880
Hey Brodie,
what the...

267
00:20:00,964 --> 00:20:02,380
Have you lost your mind?

268
00:20:06,379 --> 00:20:08,480
You ever did that to me again,
I swear I'll kill you.

269
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:17,000
You guys okay?
Are you alright?

270
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:19,868
Where is the third?
where is the pilot?

271
00:20:19,892 --> 00:20:21,798
I think he's dead.

272
00:20:21,954 --> 00:20:23,140
He's over there.

273
00:20:23,545 --> 00:20:25,000
Davis, what was that?

274
00:20:25,210 --> 00:20:27,028
I don't know, ask Brodie.

275
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:38,120
I bet she won't see that
in National Geographic.

276
00:20:54,785 --> 00:20:56,960
That's it Kovacs,
two survivors.

277
00:20:57,482 --> 00:20:58,200
Copy that.

278
00:20:59,076 --> 00:21:01,682
Pilot missing presumed
dead cause unknown.

279
00:21:01,766 --> 00:21:02,960
We need to get going now.

280
00:21:05,042 --> 00:21:07,720
Hey, I am not dragging these
guys to this jungle in hike.

281
00:21:07,826 --> 00:21:09,745
We can't give them any more time,
they'll get organized.

282
00:21:09,986 --> 00:21:11,308
What are you talking about?

283
00:21:11,665 --> 00:21:13,294
You want to tell me what
the hell you think is going on?

284
00:21:13,332 --> 00:21:14,388
They're trying to kill us,

285
00:21:14,507 --> 00:21:15,682
that's what they're bred to do.

286
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:17,170
You don't get your people
out of here now,

287
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:18,706
it might be the only chance you get.

288
00:21:18,768 --> 00:21:20,908
You're telling me that we're
going to die if we don't leave tonight?

289
00:21:20,932 --> 00:21:21,880
Come on, Brodie.

290
00:21:22,382 --> 00:21:24,588
You're not going to
get very far even if you do,

291
00:21:24,755 --> 00:21:26,800
these people are in
no condition to go anywhere.

292
00:21:28,290 --> 00:21:29,710
All right, two things.

293
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:30,948
One, we are not going anywhere.

294
00:21:30,972 --> 00:21:32,440
We are staying here,
we leave at first light.

295
00:21:32,803 --> 00:21:36,000
And two, all that matters to me
is getting my people off this island.

296
00:21:36,195 --> 00:21:38,600
Unless it's related to my mission,
I don't want to hear about it.

297
00:22:26,914 --> 00:22:29,440
Ok that's it, cynocephalus,

298
00:22:29,713 --> 00:22:31,270
the dog headed monkeys.

299
00:22:32,070 --> 00:22:34,210
This is a Savanna baboon,

300
00:22:34,590 --> 00:22:36,242
and the largest is a Chacma.

301
00:22:36,326 --> 00:22:38,795
The average male grows
up to two or three feet in height,

302
00:22:39,409 --> 00:22:41,360
weighing around 40 to 50 pounds.

303
00:22:42,857 --> 00:22:44,760
But these baboons are 5ft tall,

304
00:22:45,172 --> 00:22:47,348
I mean, they must weigh
100 pounds at least.

305
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:49,160
Some of them went up to 250.

306
00:22:51,561 --> 00:22:53,320
Smart enough to
hunt you down and kill you.

307
00:22:54,698 --> 00:22:56,360
Nice campfire story Brodie,

308
00:22:57,089 --> 00:22:58,205
no animal hunts man.

309
00:22:59,040 --> 00:22:59,990
I don't know Davis,

310
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:04,148
Grizzlies have been known
to stalk men for days,

311
00:23:04,698 --> 00:23:07,040
weeks even,
 till they drop their guard.

312
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:10,360
But these,

313
00:23:13,961 --> 00:23:15,225
nothing hunts like these.

314
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:19,780
They'll try to divert us,
split us up.

315
00:23:20,513 --> 00:23:23,868
And they'll gang up
on the stragglers.

316
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:26,988
Probably go for the legs,

317
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,388
You fall and you can't get up because
your nerves have been severed,

318
00:23:31,663 --> 00:23:33,640
and they go for
the kill shot to the head.

319
00:23:37,264 --> 00:23:38,640
These are fearless warriors.

320
00:23:39,944 --> 00:23:42,040
Kalahari bushman admired
them for their strength,

321
00:23:43,737 --> 00:23:46,350
the Egyptians worshipped
them for their intelligence.

322
00:23:47,193 --> 00:23:48,150
And the Greeks?

323
00:23:49,617 --> 00:23:51,000
Greeks just called them evil.

324
00:23:53,946 --> 00:23:55,624
This is a whole other animal.

325
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:00,880
Once they find you,
they won't stop

326
00:24:03,812 --> 00:24:04,740
because they can't.

327
00:24:14,297 --> 00:24:16,948
There were 70 different
species of animals when I left here.

328
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:20,440
You think the baboons
 killed them all?

329
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:23,440
I don't see them, do you?

330
00:24:34,010 --> 00:24:34,760
Sure.

331
00:24:35,270 --> 00:24:37,700
One day job in and out,
no problem.

332
00:24:38,959 --> 00:24:41,060
never working with this guy again.

333
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:22,140
Brodie, god you almost
gave me a heart attack.

334
00:26:25,463 --> 00:26:26,600
What are you doing here?

335
00:26:27,016 --> 00:26:30,520
I couldn't sleep,
I thought I'd go for a walk.

336
00:26:30,892 --> 00:26:33,580
No I mean, what
are you doing here?

337
00:26:35,303 --> 00:26:36,065
What do you mean?

338
00:26:37,305 --> 00:26:39,040
You always answer
a question with a question?

339
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:44,218
The village doctor
doesn't have an assistant

340
00:26:44,254 --> 00:26:45,920
not for the last ten years.

341
00:26:48,082 --> 00:26:49,640
What do you know about this place?

342
00:26:50,339 --> 00:26:51,760
I want to know what happened here.

343
00:26:52,202 --> 00:26:54,320
Why? Nobody else does.

344
00:26:54,620 --> 00:26:58,087
You care, I mean if it's so terrible,
why did you come back here?

345
00:26:59,690 --> 00:27:01,720
There you go,
asking the questions again.

346
00:27:03,064 --> 00:27:05,388
Look, nothing personal but

347
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:08,000
is none of your business, okay?

348
00:27:09,093 --> 00:27:09,920
Okay.

349
00:27:12,029 --> 00:27:14,719
It's just that next time
you take a stroll alone,

350
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:17,720
will probably be your last.

351
00:27:49,921 --> 00:27:51,160
We leave everything here.

352
00:27:55,161 --> 00:27:57,390
That is like $1,000 suitcase.

353
00:28:05,070 --> 00:28:06,111
Not any more.

354
00:28:21,029 --> 00:28:23,188
Is there anything else you want to
tell me about this place Brodie?

355
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:24,760
Don't fall behind.

356
00:28:26,507 --> 00:28:28,060
I'm just the advisor here, remember?

357
00:28:30,730 --> 00:28:31,866
A resort,

358
00:28:32,058 --> 00:28:34,480
can't wait to meet
the idiot came up with that idea.

359
00:28:36,430 --> 00:28:37,800
That would be my father.

360
00:28:39,555 --> 00:28:41,102
You know why they are
try to unload this place?

361
00:28:41,176 --> 00:28:42,110
Of course, she does,

362
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:44,868
this place is going
to be the next Cancún.

363
00:28:44,892 --> 00:28:47,068
Like five star... I'd love to
see you Brodie present

364
00:28:48,104 --> 00:28:51,520
Lady, your old man is getting
the deal of the century.

365
00:28:52,711 --> 00:28:54,600
This was going to be
 the ultimate game reserve,

366
00:28:54,774 --> 00:28:56,426
we bought everything
off the black market.

367
00:28:56,488 --> 00:28:59,020
Big orange  sheep, tigers, everything.

368
00:28:59,470 --> 00:29:00,308
and we thought,

369
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:03,880
what would someone with way
too much money give for a real hunt?

370
00:29:05,318 --> 00:29:08,120
You know, like man hunted
300,000 years ago.

371
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:13,188
So we found this scientist who was
able to genetically enhance the animals

372
00:29:13,212 --> 00:29:14,607
to make them harder to hunt

373
00:29:14,922 --> 00:29:18,050
bigger, faster, more vicious.

374
00:29:21,650 --> 00:29:23,440
First month,
three hunters were killed.

375
00:29:23,998 --> 00:29:26,540
Six months later,
the death toll had reached 20.

376
00:29:28,801 --> 00:29:30,795
But then the animals were
the hunter and we were the hunted.

377
00:29:31,910 --> 00:29:34,040
Did you know this?
No,

378
00:29:34,790 --> 00:29:39,640
Technically there are no laws here
governing this kind of activities, but...

379
00:29:39,852 --> 00:29:40,637
I don't get it.

380
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,642
What was the sport hunting a baboon?

381
00:29:43,017 --> 00:29:44,240
Not exactly a big game.

382
00:29:45,742 --> 00:29:48,520
They were just lab animals
for the initial tests,

383
00:29:49,983 --> 00:29:51,960
but they became insane
with a desire to kill.

384
00:29:54,510 --> 00:29:55,574
They escaped.

385
00:29:59,110 --> 00:30:00,760
We thought the other species
would dominate them.

386
00:30:01,930 --> 00:30:05,346
So in other words,
this island is like Chernobyl,

387
00:30:05,358 --> 00:30:06,840
and we're like
waist deep in radiation.

388
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:10,480
Yes if you get to
play the bonus round.

389
00:30:23,190 --> 00:30:25,260
Base camp to point,
come in point.

390
00:30:27,090 --> 00:30:28,080
Come in.

391
00:30:29,824 --> 00:30:30,839
Go ahead Base.

392
00:30:33,270 --> 00:30:34,740
The boat's gone, sir.

393
00:30:38,298 --> 00:30:39,640
What do you mean
the boat's gone?

394
00:30:39,664 --> 00:30:42,138
There is no radar and I can't raise
them on the radio, is gone.

395
00:30:42,831 --> 00:30:44,120
The boat is gone, sir.

396
00:30:47,370 --> 00:30:50,097
All right, keep trying.

397
00:30:50,498 --> 00:30:51,748
We're heading straight back,

398
00:30:52,335 --> 00:30:53,240
so we'll be there
in a couple of hours.

399
00:30:54,510 --> 00:30:55,320
Copy that.

400
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:57,640
Better tell him

401
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:04,960
Kovacs, keep an eye out for Baboons.

402
00:31:05,422 --> 00:31:06,480
Baboons?

403
00:31:06,871 --> 00:31:08,748
We encountered one last night

404
00:31:09,122 --> 00:31:10,640
so just in case,
keep your gun ready.

405
00:31:11,470 --> 00:31:12,320
You're kidding me.

406
00:31:12,668 --> 00:31:15,498
Look, they might be dangerous, okay?

407
00:31:15,584 --> 00:31:18,666
So just shoot if you have to,
you hear me?

408
00:31:18,921 --> 00:31:22,160
okay, we'll be there
as soon as we can, sit tight.

409
00:31:30,210 --> 00:31:32,650
Base camp to Buena Suerte,
do you copy? Over.

410
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:34,140
Please respond, over.

411
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:55,428
Sorry,

412
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:57,360
dude you gotta chill.

413
00:32:12,790 --> 00:32:13,640
What is it?

414
00:32:21,230 --> 00:32:22,680
We're too vulnerable here.

415
00:32:59,210 --> 00:33:01,440
I've never even seen
this guy before, right?

416
00:33:11,850 --> 00:33:13,360
Everybody okay?
Yeah.

417
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:15,040
Eddie?
Yes

418
00:33:16,990 --> 00:33:18,100
Watch your backs.

419
00:33:20,050 --> 00:33:21,520
Like monkeys did that?

420
00:33:22,570 --> 00:33:23,680
Let's keep moving.

421
00:33:31,490 --> 00:33:34,662
Brodie, listen to me, I want to
make you a deal, okay?

422
00:33:34,856 --> 00:33:38,660
You tell these guys that
you make us whole thing up,

423
00:33:38,684 --> 00:33:40,506
I mean you can tell
them anything else.

424
00:33:40,530 --> 00:33:42,628
If you just do me a favour

425
00:33:42,652 --> 00:33:46,539
and you keep quiet about all
this Planet of the Apes garbage,

426
00:33:46,563 --> 00:33:48,661
then when this deal is closed,

427
00:33:48,685 --> 00:33:50,588
and I mean it's going to be huge,

428
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:51,658
I swear to you,

429
00:33:51,744 --> 00:33:55,274
then I guarantee you
a percentage of the profit

430
00:33:55,322 --> 00:33:59,040
I mean, we're talking
six figures here, right?

431
00:33:59,610 --> 00:34:01,560
So you've got my word on this.

432
00:34:03,210 --> 00:34:04,260
What do you think?

433
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:11,040
Stay to the left is more open.

434
00:34:23,389 --> 00:34:26,382
So anyway, I'm talking to this guy, right?

435
00:34:26,456 --> 00:34:28,708
It's all about real estate
at that point,

436
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:32,560
he doesn't even have any knowledge
on how zoning works.

437
00:34:37,889 --> 00:34:40,474
I said what I care
about is he tried to build

438
00:34:40,572 --> 00:34:45,600
anywhere like within 5 miles
of where I'm going to build.

439
00:34:46,170 --> 00:34:48,040
You got how many million?
Like 8 million?

440
00:34:48,056 --> 00:34:49,560
10 million dollars?

441
00:36:17,098 --> 00:36:17,840
Hello?

442
00:36:19,303 --> 00:36:20,120
Hello?

443
00:36:21,890 --> 00:36:23,000
Where is everybody?

444
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:08,120
This way

445
00:37:08,290 --> 00:37:10,828
god, don't do that to me,
I hate that

446
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:14,570
you gotta a chill, dude.

447
00:37:17,090 --> 00:37:19,580
Where were you guys,
I was looking for you.

448
00:37:51,614 --> 00:37:54,940
They split us up
see what happened?

449
00:37:55,990 --> 00:37:58,228
We got to go back,
before he is history.

450
00:37:58,600 --> 00:38:00,520
What do you mean,
is he dead?

451
00:38:01,090 --> 00:38:03,280
Davis, is he dead?

452
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:07,708
Where's Tara?

453
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:09,628
Was she on radio?

454
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:13,646
Tara Tara, do you copy?

455
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:16,122
Tara, do you hear me?
Do you copy? Over.

456
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:26,880
It's her.

457
00:38:28,570 --> 00:38:30,548
Wait Brodie, Brodie.

458
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:23,800
Tara, please respond.
Tara do you hear me? Over.

459
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:33,960
This is San Miguel island
to Buena Suerte, do you copy?

460
00:39:34,088 --> 00:39:36,960
For anyone in the media,
please respond, over.

461
00:39:50,230 --> 00:39:51,290
It's broken.

462
00:40:03,170 --> 00:40:03,960
They took her

463
00:40:04,910 --> 00:40:06,006
Are you sure?

464
00:40:06,188 --> 00:40:07,640
What are they going to do to her?

465
00:40:08,096 --> 00:40:09,560
Brodie, is she alive?

466
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:11,920
You want to get home?

467
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:14,064
Now's the time to
get the hell out of here.

468
00:40:14,408 --> 00:40:16,200
We're not going anywhere
until we find her.

469
00:40:17,207 --> 00:40:19,000
You can bet your life
you're going to do it without me.

470
00:40:19,448 --> 00:40:21,354
Yeah and you've been
such a big help too,

471
00:40:21,452 --> 00:40:23,388
I'll take my chances.
Give me 30 seconds,

472
00:40:23,412 --> 00:40:25,988
and I can pinpoint any
air breeding target on this island.

473
00:40:28,046 --> 00:40:29,800
for what tell
all the toys of yours.

474
00:40:34,350 --> 00:40:36,000
Is that what happened last time?

475
00:40:37,333 --> 00:40:38,428
Did you leave your people?

476
00:40:38,555 --> 00:40:39,948
Turn your back
when they needed you?

477
00:40:41,021 --> 00:40:41,550
Huh?

478
00:40:49,700 --> 00:40:51,340
Davis are you okay?

479
00:40:57,356 --> 00:40:58,520
I guess you did.

480
00:41:01,910 --> 00:41:03,548
With or without you I'm going.

481
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:05,868
You are a fool.

482
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:09,640
Hell, you should have known
that the minute I let you on this mission.

483
00:41:13,210 --> 00:41:15,200
Base camp, base camp
do you copy? Over.

484
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:17,224
Roger, minor spacing go ahead

485
00:41:18,070 --> 00:41:20,280
Request a thermal recon
on these coordinates,

486
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:22,600
Copy points
tell me what coordinates.

487
00:41:23,369 --> 00:41:24,320
I know where she is.

488
00:41:31,590 --> 00:41:32,760
Check that Base,

489
00:41:33,690 --> 00:41:36,188
be advised we are proceeding
to unknown location.

490
00:41:38,267 --> 00:41:40,743
Roger point,
can you state purpose.

491
00:41:41,973 --> 00:41:44,640
To locate and retrieve missing
member of landing party.

492
00:41:45,910 --> 00:41:46,868
Stay with Eddie

493
00:43:19,256 --> 00:43:22,966
Okay, easy boy

494
00:43:23,148 --> 00:43:24,780
I just want my gun back.

495
00:43:27,090 --> 00:43:28,223
No problem.

496
00:43:50,030 --> 00:43:50,960
So that's it?

497
00:43:52,229 --> 00:43:53,138
That's it.

498
00:44:35,880 --> 00:44:37,450
Is best I go in alone.

499
00:44:39,344 --> 00:44:42,794
I don't make it shoot
anything that comes out of there.

500
00:44:43,830 --> 00:44:45,200
How many do you
figure are in there?

501
00:44:46,858 --> 00:44:48,300
One, two?
Less than a million.

502
00:44:49,890 --> 00:44:51,225
Well then like everything
else on this island,

503
00:44:51,249 --> 00:44:53,216
I'll just figure for
the worst and double it.

504
00:44:55,050 --> 00:44:56,080
Now you're getting it.

505
00:45:05,608 --> 00:45:08,751
Here, I want you to take this.

506
00:45:12,030 --> 00:45:13,320
Stay on channel two,

507
00:45:14,250 --> 00:45:16,240
the reception is going
to be like crap in there.

508
00:45:16,776 --> 00:45:18,780
I can't talk to you,
but I can hear you,

509
00:45:19,443 --> 00:45:20,395
in other words,

510
00:45:20,966 --> 00:45:23,320
it won't be any different from
the way we've been communicating.

511
00:45:27,190 --> 00:45:28,670
Hold on my calls.

512
00:45:46,104 --> 00:45:47,240
Brodie

513
00:45:53,490 --> 00:45:54,440
Are you okay?

514
00:45:55,710 --> 00:45:56,460
Yeah.

515
00:46:05,321 --> 00:46:06,520
What are you doing?

516
00:46:08,040 --> 00:46:09,600
These tunnels are
all dead ends,

517
00:46:10,069 --> 00:46:11,773
they got to come through here
if they want to get out.

518
00:46:14,630 --> 00:46:16,161
You're going to blow it up?

519
00:46:16,790 --> 00:46:18,126
You got a better idea?

520
00:46:18,308 --> 00:46:19,760
Do you know what this can mean?

521
00:46:20,210 --> 00:46:22,194
They are developing
at an incredible rate,

522
00:46:22,232 --> 00:46:23,788
they're nearly Neanderthal.

523
00:46:26,080 --> 00:46:28,090
So get out of here
before they get cable.

524
00:46:28,920 --> 00:46:30,158
This is not funny,

525
00:46:30,458 --> 00:46:32,068
If you knew they were
going to bring me here,

526
00:46:32,322 --> 00:46:34,202
who knows what else they're capable of.

527
00:46:36,546 --> 00:46:39,122
After I pull this we got 10 seconds,

528
00:46:39,266 --> 00:46:40,320
get out of here.

529
00:47:16,610 --> 00:47:19,174
You know I used to
love going to the Zoo,

530
00:47:19,282 --> 00:47:23,060
but after this forget it man,
I am like never going back.

531
00:47:25,409 --> 00:47:27,517
What happened? Are you
guys all right? We heard this...

532
00:47:27,613 --> 00:47:30,468
We got 6 hours of daylight,
we can make it to the beach if we hurry.

533
00:47:30,840 --> 00:47:33,480
Back through the jungle?
You know a better way?

534
00:47:33,768 --> 00:47:35,230
And then we go home, right?

535
00:47:35,340 --> 00:47:37,468
Set up a perimeter,
we wait for rescue.

536
00:47:38,417 --> 00:47:40,320
And then we'll go home, right?

537
00:47:42,670 --> 00:47:46,480
Well I guess Kelsey, that's right,
this nightmare is about to end.

538
00:47:47,407 --> 00:47:49,400
Base camp, base camp
do you copy? Over.

539
00:47:53,510 --> 00:47:54,920
Kovacs, come in.

540
00:47:56,457 --> 00:47:57,440
Kovacs?

541
00:47:59,610 --> 00:48:00,360
Nothing,

542
00:48:02,001 --> 00:48:03,200
maybe we are too far,

543
00:48:05,650 --> 00:48:07,300
maybe the batteries are low.

544
00:48:31,490 --> 00:48:32,560
Kovacs?

545
00:49:18,320 --> 00:49:21,080
When I find this baboon
I'm going to waste his ass.

546
00:49:29,310 --> 00:49:32,360
Great, now what
are we going to do?

547
00:49:37,650 --> 00:49:39,782
I want to go home.
Relax.

548
00:49:39,926 --> 00:49:41,508
We still got a chance Kelsey.

549
00:49:41,960 --> 00:49:45,566
We're out of chances.
There has got to be a way off this island.

550
00:49:45,638 --> 00:49:46,850
Not without the boat.

551
00:49:46,970 --> 00:49:48,900
No, they're here.

552
00:49:49,230 --> 00:49:51,360
The boat is here,
they'll be here.

553
00:49:55,150 --> 00:49:56,440
Just calm down.

554
00:49:57,240 --> 00:50:00,068
We're going to get us killed, all of us,

555
00:50:00,650 --> 00:50:04,460
you're in over your head, we all are.

556
00:50:08,310 --> 00:50:09,960
My father will pay you.

557
00:50:10,890 --> 00:50:13,162
He'll make you rich,
whatever you want,

558
00:50:13,296 --> 00:50:17,368
just please get me
out of this place.

559
00:50:19,520 --> 00:50:23,960
Mister Davis,
we still have the life-raft

560
00:50:28,690 --> 00:50:30,400
Which of us gets to go home?

561
00:50:31,870 --> 00:50:34,160
It's only good for two people.

562
00:50:36,530 --> 00:50:38,320
Someone can swim alongside.

563
00:50:38,458 --> 00:50:40,240
Oh, yeah the Sharks
would love that.

564
00:50:40,730 --> 00:50:43,920
Then I'll go, I'll get help
someone will find me.

565
00:50:44,630 --> 00:50:47,050
My father will not leave
me here to die.

566
00:50:47,110 --> 00:50:48,080
How will he know?

567
00:50:49,190 --> 00:50:50,650
The pilot called for Mayday.

568
00:50:50,710 --> 00:50:53,670
They're going to make it look like
an accident to protect their stock.

569
00:50:55,760 --> 00:50:57,440
They're going to
sweep it under the rug.

570
00:51:00,160 --> 00:51:02,120
Like they did 10 years ago.

571
00:51:10,320 --> 00:51:11,600
What about the lab?

572
00:51:13,410 --> 00:51:14,606
What about the Lab?

573
00:51:14,738 --> 00:51:16,246
It's just up over the hill, right?

574
00:51:16,368 --> 00:51:17,590
The storage shed.

575
00:51:18,870 --> 00:51:20,150
What's up there Brodie?

576
00:51:21,090 --> 00:51:24,383
Even if we got it working would
be history before anybody got to us.

577
00:51:24,930 --> 00:51:26,080
Got what working?

578
00:51:34,780 --> 00:51:36,320
There used to be a transmitter.

579
00:52:07,770 --> 00:52:10,628
Brodie let's recon ahead,
check things out,

580
00:52:11,738 --> 00:52:13,080
you two stay here with Eddie.

581
00:52:40,437 --> 00:52:42,380
Shortest way is
through the grass, right?

582
00:52:43,210 --> 00:52:44,468
Jungle on either side,

583
00:52:44,682 --> 00:52:46,520
given the odds,
I prefer the grass.

584
00:52:49,081 --> 00:52:50,414
Doesn't make any difference.

585
00:52:51,590 --> 00:52:54,495
It's level, no trees overhead,
no rivers to cross,

586
00:52:54,814 --> 00:52:56,828
We can make it.
Haven't you figured it out yet?

587
00:52:59,559 --> 00:53:00,760
We're not getting off this island,

588
00:53:00,934 --> 00:53:03,214
we got no food, no water,
no communication.

589
00:53:03,441 --> 00:53:04,588
We're running out of ammunition,

590
00:53:04,841 --> 00:53:06,254
and there's more of them
than there are of us,

591
00:53:07,459 --> 00:53:08,720
it's not a question of making it.

592
00:53:13,928 --> 00:53:15,033
This is how it ends.

593
00:53:16,735 --> 00:53:18,103
All I need is some time,

594
00:53:18,240 --> 00:53:20,311
you find me some cover,
I will figure a way out.

595
00:53:24,430 --> 00:53:25,800
You don't fool me Brodie,

596
00:53:26,896 --> 00:53:28,320
you didn't come back here to die,

597
00:53:29,710 --> 00:53:31,670
you came back to
end the nightmares.

598
00:53:35,990 --> 00:53:37,628
Okay Eddie, bring him up.

599
00:53:38,280 --> 00:53:40,508
Okay, we're moving out.

600
00:54:23,040 --> 00:54:25,870
All I need is one shot
at those monkeys.

601
00:54:45,430 --> 00:54:46,268
Eddie, what's that?

602
00:54:47,320 --> 00:54:49,028
Come out you son of a...

603
00:54:49,520 --> 00:54:51,280
Say it again, Eddie?

604
00:54:53,570 --> 00:54:54,800
Eddie, what's your point

605
00:54:55,033 --> 00:54:56,226
Eddie?

606
00:54:56,408 --> 00:54:59,242
Davis, I think I'm going to
need a little help guys.

607
00:54:59,386 --> 00:54:59,948
Eddie?

608
00:55:09,440 --> 00:55:10,680
Eddie?

609
00:55:15,689 --> 00:55:16,800
Eddie?

610
00:55:38,360 --> 00:55:39,840
Eddie

611
00:55:48,680 --> 00:55:49,960
Davis?

612
00:55:52,200 --> 00:55:53,240
Something is coming

613
00:55:54,640 --> 00:55:55,607
Something is coming

614
00:56:00,960 --> 00:56:02,400
Stay close

615
00:56:06,783 --> 00:56:08,680
Go, go, go, go

616
00:56:52,520 --> 00:56:53,680
Eddie

617
00:56:55,200 --> 00:56:57,840
I can't move my legs.
You're going to be alright.

618
00:57:01,997 --> 00:57:03,680
I got him.

619
00:57:04,158 --> 00:57:05,961
Eddie

620
00:57:06,008 --> 00:57:08,142
Lift him up,
get him out of here.

621
00:57:25,650 --> 00:57:26,840
How far Brodie?

622
00:57:27,222 --> 00:57:28,209
Top of the Hill.

623
00:57:29,030 --> 00:57:29,920
Oh, god.

624
00:57:38,390 --> 00:57:39,740
Still behind us.

625
00:59:22,650 --> 00:59:24,250
There is a generator in that shed,

626
00:59:24,930 --> 00:59:26,580
I might be able to get it going,

627
00:59:27,210 --> 00:59:28,520
still plenty of fuel.

628
00:59:30,570 --> 00:59:32,210
Transmitter looks intact,

629
00:59:32,390 --> 00:59:34,760
if we can get juice up there,
I can get us picked up,

630
00:59:35,360 --> 00:59:36,720
if I can get a call-out.

631
00:59:37,236 --> 00:59:39,120
Yeah, but how long do we have?

632
00:59:40,410 --> 00:59:42,154
There was like a ton
of them back there.

633
00:59:42,252 --> 00:59:44,080
They won't attack us
while we're in the open.

634
00:59:44,610 --> 00:59:47,240
They'll go back to
the others and wait till night.

635
00:59:47,910 --> 00:59:51,074
We got to get Eddie somewhere,
he's lost a lot of blood.

636
00:59:51,242 --> 00:59:53,480
We're not safe down
here that's for sure.

637
01:00:22,880 --> 01:00:25,320
Hang on, you're going to be all right.

638
01:00:27,373 --> 01:00:29,000
We got to sit him down.

639
01:00:29,170 --> 01:00:31,910
This place looks more like a bunker
than a lookout town.

640
01:01:03,016 --> 01:01:04,000
Asme?

641
01:01:04,609 --> 01:01:05,720
It's a blow torch.

642
01:01:06,710 --> 01:01:09,868
Looks like whoever was here last
left in a awfully big hurry,

643
01:01:10,249 --> 01:01:11,080
ten years ago.

644
01:01:21,670 --> 01:01:24,760
Coming back to this island is probably
the stupidest thing I ever did.

645
01:01:28,970 --> 01:01:30,200
I doubt that.

646
01:03:14,610 --> 01:03:15,420
All right.

647
01:03:19,920 --> 01:03:21,040
It's dead

648
01:03:40,990 --> 01:03:43,490
My peers in the profession informed me

649
01:03:43,600 --> 01:03:45,000
that it would not be possible to

650
01:03:45,304 --> 01:03:48,530
breed animals to become
more aggressive predators.

651
01:03:48,970 --> 01:03:52,188
They ostracized me and
called me irresponsible,

652
01:03:52,434 --> 01:03:55,778
too radical banished me
from their lofty halls of learning

653
01:03:55,864 --> 01:03:59,090
with a sign around my neck
which read extremist,

654
01:03:59,609 --> 01:04:02,114
and to them, I have
but one thing to say.

655
01:04:02,212 --> 01:04:04,938
Being an extremist is
the only way to discover

656
01:04:05,034 --> 01:04:07,662
where the boundaries of
what is possible truly lie.

657
01:04:07,746 --> 01:04:12,062
Clearly, my tests show that there are
no limits to what we could do here.

658
01:04:12,136 --> 01:04:15,308
Somebody will recognize
what I'm doing here

659
01:04:15,332 --> 01:04:18,000
is Nobel Prize calibre work,

660
01:04:18,160 --> 01:04:19,148
and if they don't,

661
01:04:20,525 --> 01:04:23,085
radical, they don't know what radical is,

662
01:04:23,109 --> 01:04:24,462
I'll show them radical.

663
01:04:24,546 --> 01:04:27,411
Radical is their way of drawing
a line between themselves,

664
01:04:27,655 --> 01:04:29,226
and what they cannot comprehend.

665
01:04:29,298 --> 01:04:32,221
They have no concept
of the courage it takes

666
01:04:32,245 --> 01:04:35,920
to tap into the primal fear
of another living creature.

667
01:04:36,114 --> 01:04:38,588
Turn it into a force of fury,

668
01:04:38,612 --> 01:04:43,482
with one pure purpose
to survive at all costs.

669
01:04:43,626 --> 01:04:45,960
No bother with the social
order of the group.

670
01:04:46,396 --> 01:04:50,920
No bother with the thousands of needless
minutia that clutter up our lives.

671
01:04:51,610 --> 01:04:56,474
Wives, children,
family, friends,

672
01:04:56,632 --> 01:04:59,498
imagine the pureness in that.

673
01:04:59,644 --> 01:05:02,178
By increasing the DNA
strength in these animals,

674
01:05:02,274 --> 01:05:04,308
I have accelerated the breeding cycles

675
01:05:04,332 --> 01:05:06,606
to a level of nature itself
would never have achieved.

676
01:05:06,678 --> 01:05:08,762
I have stared into the face of god,

677
01:05:08,896 --> 01:05:10,120
and guess what?

678
01:05:11,830 --> 01:05:12,950
He blinked.

679
01:05:27,050 --> 01:05:28,988
Run for days
if the bills all that.

680
01:05:29,440 --> 01:05:29,960
Good,

681
01:05:30,356 --> 01:05:32,455
I'm just trying to
find the antenna cable.

682
01:05:33,616 --> 01:05:35,000
Do you think we
should put a lock on that?

683
01:05:36,950 --> 01:05:38,900
Lock isn't going to keep him out.

684
01:06:05,230 --> 01:06:07,240
You wanted to know
why I came here,

685
01:06:10,010 --> 01:06:11,295
the man you worked with,

686
01:06:13,370 --> 01:06:15,440
the man who leaves me this legacy,

687
01:06:18,857 --> 01:06:20,157
it was my father.

688
01:06:28,412 --> 01:06:30,342
I came to the village four months ago,

689
01:06:33,650 --> 01:06:35,040
nobody would take me here.

690
01:06:37,130 --> 01:06:38,850
They said it was cursed,

691
01:06:42,436 --> 01:06:43,440
I almost gave up.

692
01:06:45,769 --> 01:06:47,775
The plane crashed,
and I had my chance.

693
01:06:53,470 --> 01:06:54,760
Just wanted to know,

694
01:06:56,650 --> 01:06:59,148
I wanted to know if it was true,
what my mother told me

695
01:07:01,526 --> 01:07:03,320
it was true, alright.

696
01:07:10,676 --> 01:07:13,350
He had plans to experiment
on human next.

697
01:07:15,410 --> 01:07:18,560
He's going to give the local
village kids vaccine shots,

698
01:07:19,600 --> 01:07:21,320
that were really a DNA boost.

699
01:07:25,170 --> 01:07:28,748
How far is he going to go with all this?

700
01:07:28,772 --> 01:07:32,160
I mean, he lost his mind?

701
01:07:33,690 --> 01:07:35,068
Crazy is a bad bug.

702
01:07:38,983 --> 01:07:40,000
I didn't know,

703
01:07:41,170 --> 01:07:42,228
just like you.

704
01:07:46,640 --> 01:07:48,480
The son of a bitch wouldn't
come with me though.

705
01:07:51,530 --> 01:07:52,820
Left me to live,

706
01:07:54,080 --> 01:07:55,560
that's not what I wanted to say.

707
01:07:59,610 --> 01:08:01,240
We used to sit around at night

708
01:08:02,160 --> 01:08:04,636
having a cigar and
a snort he liked to say,

709
01:08:05,671 --> 01:08:07,880
it ain't broke, let's fix it anyway.
What the hell?

710
01:08:13,510 --> 01:08:14,863
Son of a bitch,

711
01:08:15,657 --> 01:08:16,760
left me to live.

712
01:08:20,810 --> 01:08:22,480
I can still hear the screaming,

713
01:08:25,350 --> 01:08:27,400
Maybe he was a lucky one, he died.

714
01:08:33,609 --> 01:08:34,600
I don't know,

715
01:08:36,310 --> 01:08:37,388
I was just thinking,

716
01:08:39,084 --> 01:08:40,213
this is,

717
01:08:41,800 --> 01:08:43,720
this is like a second chance,

718
01:08:44,960 --> 01:08:45,744
I mean

719
01:08:47,390 --> 01:08:49,148
I know we can never wipe them out,

720
01:08:53,517 --> 01:08:55,640
but I couldn't save the father.

721
01:09:03,229 --> 01:09:04,520
And maybe he learnt

722
01:09:06,050 --> 01:09:07,320
or the screaming.

723
01:09:13,040 --> 01:09:14,040
Both

724
01:09:18,210 --> 01:09:19,800
all those people I left behind.

725
01:09:35,470 --> 01:09:37,240
Okay, we're in business, people.

726
01:09:41,510 --> 01:09:43,601
Mayday, Mayday,
do you copy? Over.

727
01:09:46,590 --> 01:09:48,649
Mayday, Mayday,
this is an emergency.

728
01:09:48,710 --> 01:09:50,460
Does anyone read me? Over.

729
01:09:51,080 --> 01:09:52,334
This is a distress signal,

730
01:09:52,381 --> 01:09:54,662
we are five survivors
in need of rescue,

731
01:09:54,746 --> 01:09:56,520
does anyone copy? Over.

732
01:10:00,010 --> 01:10:02,228
Yeah, you got SS Blue Horizon here.

733
01:10:02,252 --> 01:10:05,658
we can read you,
can you state your location? Over.

734
01:10:05,804 --> 01:10:07,908
We are in the southwest corner of...

735
01:10:10,399 --> 01:10:11,591
Did we lose power?

736
01:10:11,616 --> 01:10:12,540
What happened?

737
01:10:12,930 --> 01:10:14,098
It's not the power.

738
01:10:14,244 --> 01:10:15,578
Maybe it's the frequency.

739
01:10:26,880 --> 01:10:27,840
They're here.

740
01:10:41,530 --> 01:10:43,622
Now, don't shoot unless
it's a kill shop,

741
01:10:43,696 --> 01:10:45,458
Otherwise it's not
going to last very long,

742
01:10:45,544 --> 01:10:46,800
it's all the ammo we got.

743
01:10:48,320 --> 01:10:51,994
Hey Davis, put the girls
in the back with Eddie.

744
01:10:52,102 --> 01:10:53,400
I was thinking the same thing.

745
01:10:54,290 --> 01:10:55,628
Just give him this,

746
01:11:07,280 --> 01:11:11,188
Eddie, just in case.

747
01:11:16,097 --> 01:11:18,097
I just want to say

748
01:11:18,440 --> 01:11:19,520
we're going to make it.

749
01:11:27,280 --> 01:11:28,720
Thank you

750
01:11:30,310 --> 01:11:32,140
I'm not very good
with these things.

751
01:11:33,190 --> 01:11:36,580
Think of something you
hate and blow it away.

752
01:11:37,510 --> 01:11:39,240
Guys who show up late,

753
01:11:39,570 --> 01:11:41,360
bogus family functions.

754
01:11:41,890 --> 01:11:45,340
Watching your father try to
impress his lame friends.

755
01:11:58,480 --> 01:12:00,200
Figure for the worst
and double it.

756
01:12:02,930 --> 01:12:05,600
More than two,
less than a million.

757
01:12:39,899 --> 01:12:41,360
Eddie, breathe.

758
01:12:43,142 --> 01:12:44,606
Eddie, breathe

759
01:13:25,289 --> 01:13:26,800
Stay down

760
01:13:49,891 --> 01:13:51,280
Freaks

761
01:13:53,370 --> 01:13:54,180
All right.

762
01:14:12,840 --> 01:14:13,760
Eddie?

763
01:14:36,730 --> 01:14:38,240
The antenna is useless,

764
01:14:38,286 --> 01:14:41,270
we can't fix it because
they chew through the wires,

765
01:14:42,250 --> 01:14:43,960
No more ammunition left.

766
01:14:45,910 --> 01:14:47,860
We can't fight off another attack.

767
01:14:53,570 --> 01:14:55,026
Now what do we do?

768
01:14:55,208 --> 01:14:56,240
It's over.

769
01:15:08,830 --> 01:15:10,000
What's so funny?

770
01:15:17,760 --> 01:15:18,560
We let them

771
01:15:20,630 --> 01:15:21,740
What do you think?

772
01:15:28,950 --> 01:15:30,120
We let them.

773
01:15:32,770 --> 01:15:34,300
We have plenty of fuel.

774
01:16:27,320 --> 01:16:29,120
That's it.
Now what?

775
01:16:30,960 --> 01:16:32,280
We wait.

776
01:16:34,890 --> 01:16:38,942
My peers in the profession informed
me that it would not be possible,

777
01:16:39,386 --> 01:16:42,850
to breed animals to
become more aggressive.

778
01:16:44,120 --> 01:16:47,200
They ostracized me
and called me irresponsible,

779
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:48,508
too mad,

780
01:16:49,200 --> 01:16:51,748
they banished me from
their lofty halls of learning,

781
01:16:52,152 --> 01:16:53,600
with a sign around my neck.

782
01:16:58,270 --> 01:17:00,308
They have no idea what radical is,

783
01:17:00,520 --> 01:17:02,587
radical is their way of drawing a line

784
01:17:02,611 --> 01:17:05,028
between themselves
and what they cannot comprehend.

785
01:17:05,891 --> 01:17:08,388
They have no concept

786
01:17:09,078 --> 01:17:13,240
of the courage it takes
to tap into the primal fear

787
01:17:13,264 --> 01:17:16,496
of another living creature
and turn it into

788
01:17:17,172 --> 01:17:19,228
turn it into

789
01:17:20,680 --> 01:17:21,606
They're going up.

790
01:17:21,726 --> 01:17:27,200
one single purpose
to survive at all costs.

791
01:17:27,416 --> 01:17:29,388
No bother social order.

792
01:17:30,878 --> 01:17:35,741
No bothered thousands of needless
minutia that surround our lives

793
01:17:36,177 --> 01:17:39,740
no wives, children,
family, friends

794
01:17:40,190 --> 01:17:42,880
worrying about what bills to pay,
what cologne to wear,

795
01:17:43,490 --> 01:17:45,308
what automobile to be seen in.

796
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:50,508
Imagine the pureness of that
living with one true purpose.

797
01:17:50,774 --> 01:17:52,480
One sole reason to be

798
01:17:59,310 --> 01:18:01,268
Imagine living with no fear,

799
01:18:01,292 --> 01:18:05,340
out here I must admit there
is a temptation to play part.

800
01:18:06,330 --> 01:18:08,908
We are making the animals
harder to hunt all right,

801
01:18:08,932 --> 01:18:11,338
but who am I kidding?
They're going to think I've lost it.

802
01:18:11,364 --> 01:18:14,308
They're going to think I'm the
lunatic out to vindicate himself

803
01:18:54,840 --> 01:18:59,360
Hey, I remember me?

804
01:19:07,410 --> 01:19:10,440
I sure as hell remember you,
you son of a bitch.

805
01:20:12,310 --> 01:20:13,360
Finish it.

806
01:20:21,840 --> 01:20:23,200
Run

807
01:20:27,480 --> 01:20:29,120
Davis, what are you doing?

808
01:20:31,960 --> 01:20:33,400
He's giving us a chance.

809
01:21:37,610 --> 01:21:38,868
Come on.

810
01:22:11,640 --> 01:22:13,080
There it is.

811
01:22:37,802 --> 01:22:39,160
It's Davis

812
01:22:41,960 --> 01:22:44,268
Are you crazy? We got to go.

813
01:22:44,292 --> 01:22:46,800
No.
Davis!

814
01:22:53,880 --> 01:22:55,600
Oh god, Davis.

815
01:22:59,840 --> 01:23:01,600
Come on

816
01:23:40,840 --> 01:23:43,720
We made it, thank god.

817
01:24:05,640 --> 01:24:07,160
See you in a minute Doc.
