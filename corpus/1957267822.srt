Don't wake up.

Please, manana.

00:02:10,064 --> 00:02:11,657

00:02:11,657 --> 00:02:12,490
Hey, hey!

30
00:02:13,643 --> 00:02:14,996
Don't wake up.

00:02:14,996 --> 00:02:16,246
Please, manana.

32
00:02:17,488 --> 00:02:18,947
Manana.

33
00:02:18,947 --> 00:02:19,780
Hey, hey!

34
00:02:21,009 --> 00:02:22,352

00:02:24,872 --> 00:02:26,316
Manana.

37
00:02:26,316 --> 00:02:27,149
Hey, hey!

38
00:02:28,336 --> 00:02:29,683
Don't wake up.

39
00:02:29,683 --> 00:02:30,933
Please, manana.

40
00:02:32,168 --> 00:02:33,301
Manana.

41
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:44,300
- First the olive oil.

42
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:46,581
The Greeks called it God's nectar.

43
00:03:46,581 --> 00:03:47,960
Can I
please get a price check

44
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:50,500
on the electroplated ladle?

45
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:52,870
- Can I use non-stick
spray instead of oil?

46
00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:55,100
- Oh. Come on, please.

47
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:57,520
I know olive oil is the big enemy here.

48
00:03:57,520 --> 00:04:00,320
We're talking about a
little tablespoon. Okay?

49
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:01,240
- Give me a break.

50
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:04,190
If I always ate what I
loved, I'd be 200 pounds

51
00:04:04,190 --> 00:04:06,141
and then no one would want me.

52
00:04:06,974 --> 00:04:08,133
- Sorry. Tell me your name.

53
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,323
- Denise.

54
00:04:10,323 --> 00:04:11,400
- Denise.

55
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:13,883
Denise, do you consider olive oil a sin?

56
00:04:13,883 --> 00:04:16,563
I mean food and eating are
forms of pleasure, too.

57
00:04:17,459 --> 00:04:19,490
It's not just about how you look.

58
00:04:19,490 --> 00:04:21,240
- Are you trying to say
that guys don't care

59
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:22,710
about how we look?

60
00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:23,832
- You look beautiful.

61
00:04:25,410 --> 00:04:26,933
Did that answer your question?

62
00:04:27,830 --> 00:04:28,663
- Yes.

63
00:04:29,930 --> 00:04:31,530
- All right then.

64
00:04:31,530 --> 00:04:34,040
Make sure the olive
oil is sufficiently hot

65
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,590
before you add the real garlic.

66
00:04:36,630 --> 00:04:37,640
No fake garlic.

67
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:38,613
The real one.

68
00:04:39,790 --> 00:04:41,000
First taste...

69
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:44,653
Is always with the eyes.

70
00:04:49,659 --> 00:04:50,683
Any questions?

71
00:04:51,610 --> 00:04:52,443
- Yes.

72
00:04:53,530 --> 00:04:55,469
Do you have a valentine?

73
00:04:59,291 --> 00:05:00,124
- No.

74
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:02,843
Well sort of.

75
00:05:04,490 --> 00:05:06,940
Oh Mikey, look what I got for you.

76
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:08,771
Oh, sweet.

77
00:05:08,771 --> 00:05:10,157
Oh, man, this smell has been driving me

78
00:05:10,157 --> 00:05:11,713
fuckin' bonkers out here.

79
00:05:12,910 --> 00:05:15,090
Mm. Mm!

80
00:05:15,090 --> 00:05:16,940
What are you getting Sam for her birthday?

81
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:18,100
- Huh?

82
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:19,050
- Sam's birthday bro.

83
00:05:19,050 --> 00:05:20,630
What are you giving her?

84
00:05:20,630 --> 00:05:22,620
- Oh, I went to Goodwill.

85
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:25,200
- Perfect. I got her Scrabble.

86
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:26,060
- She'll love it.

87
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:26,893
Sweet.

88
00:05:26,893 --> 00:05:28,530
I'll see tonight, okay?

89
00:05:28,530 --> 00:05:29,470
- Mm.

90
00:05:29,470 --> 00:05:32,140
Mm, man, this one has
gotta go in your cookbook.

91
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:33,763
- Yeah, if I ever finish it.

92
00:05:44,508 --> 00:05:46,030
- Could you hold still?

93
00:05:46,030 --> 00:05:47,320
You're worse than my actors.

94
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:48,990
- Please finish today.

95
00:05:48,990 --> 00:05:50,570
You'll thank me.

96
00:05:50,570 --> 00:05:51,403
- Hey Sam.

97
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:54,460
- Thank you.

98
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:55,460
- Christ.

99
00:05:55,460 --> 00:05:57,880
- Wow. That's different.

100
00:05:57,880 --> 00:05:59,837
- Good different or bad different?

101
00:05:59,837 --> 00:06:01,263
- Different-different.

102
00:06:03,564 --> 00:06:05,168
- Did I not tell you this was pointless.

103
00:06:06,070 --> 00:06:07,750
Your dad called you.

104
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:09,620
- It's your birthday. He called you.

105
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:13,740
- No, he called you, but he
did wish me a happy birthday.

106
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:15,430
- Nice try, Sam.

107
00:06:15,430 --> 00:06:16,353
- Let me tell you something.

108
00:06:16,353 --> 00:06:19,730
It's a little tricky doing
lips when they're moving.

109
00:06:19,730 --> 00:06:21,630
- You love the challenge.
- No.

110
00:06:21,630 --> 00:06:24,917
Setting you up on a date
with Joe was a challenge.

111
00:06:24,917 --> 00:06:25,750
- Joe?

112
00:06:27,075 --> 00:06:28,050
Who is Joe?

113
00:06:28,050 --> 00:06:30,430
- Her blind valentine.

114
00:06:30,430 --> 00:06:32,040
- Well, why the makeup?

115
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:32,873
Funny.

116
00:06:32,873 --> 00:06:35,332
- Sammy has a date.

117
00:06:35,332 --> 00:06:37,933
Sam has a date.
- It's not a date.

118
00:06:37,933 --> 00:06:39,383
It's a mercy date.

119
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:41,540
He's valentine-less.

120
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:43,130
- He's very rich.

121
00:06:43,130 --> 00:06:45,146
An accountant.

122
00:06:45,146 --> 00:06:46,658
- An accountant.

123
00:06:46,658 --> 00:06:49,030
Oh, Sam! An accountant.

124
00:06:49,030 --> 00:06:51,270
- If he makes you so wet,
why don't you date him?

125
00:06:51,270 --> 00:06:52,780
Like I care about money.

126
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:55,409
- Hello? Money helps.

127
00:06:55,409 --> 00:06:56,717
- I got something for you.

128
00:06:58,722 --> 00:06:59,555
- Yay!

129
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:06,517
- Watch the 'do!

130
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:08,730
Oh my God.

131
00:07:08,730 --> 00:07:10,553
You look like a pimp.

132
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:13,173
- It rocks.

133
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,280
I fucking love it, yes.

134
00:07:18,870 --> 00:07:20,100
- It's cute.
- Thank you.

135
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:21,390
- Really cute.

136
00:07:21,390 --> 00:07:22,223
- Charming.

137
00:07:25,753 --> 00:07:26,586
- Freeze!

138
00:07:27,419 --> 00:07:29,150
You're under arrest, hussy.

139
00:07:29,150 --> 00:07:30,770
- Happy birthday, Sam.

140
00:07:30,770 --> 00:07:31,603
Hey.

141
00:07:31,603 --> 00:07:32,436
- Hey.

142
00:07:33,790 --> 00:07:35,530
Okay. What does she see in him?

143
00:07:35,530 --> 00:07:37,260
- He's a nice guy.

144
00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:38,847
- My brother's a pig.

145
00:07:38,847 --> 00:07:39,970
- Hey.

146
00:07:39,970 --> 00:07:42,840
He gave her rough riders
for Valentine's Day.

147
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:44,913
- Oh God, please let me be adopted.

148
00:07:46,808 --> 00:07:49,330
- You know what? I have to wash my face.

149
00:07:49,330 --> 00:07:51,747
- Oh, if you do I will personally kill you

150
00:07:51,747 --> 00:07:53,000
and I'm not kidding.

151
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,409
- Okay. I just have to pee.

152
00:07:55,409 --> 00:07:56,610
- You know what's so weird, Sam,

153
00:07:56,610 --> 00:07:59,310
is I completely believe that
you're just going to pee!

154
00:08:04,610 --> 00:08:06,293
- Hey, fuck off, perv!

155
00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:09,670
- She's sweet. I'm telling you, man.

156
00:08:09,670 --> 00:08:10,970
- I don't want to hear this.

157
00:08:10,970 --> 00:08:12,930
- Dude, she got titties.

158
00:08:12,930 --> 00:08:14,300
- Yeah. I assumed that.

159
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:17,150
- But, Sam is not Sam anymore.

160
00:08:17,150 --> 00:08:18,920
You know what I'm sayin'?

161
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:19,940
- I hope not.

162
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:21,010
- Oh, come on.

163
00:08:21,010 --> 00:08:22,517
Tell me you haven't at
least thought about it.

164
00:08:22,517 --> 00:08:24,380
- Peter, Sam is like my best friend.

165
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:25,810
She's family.

166
00:08:25,810 --> 00:08:26,643
- Look at her ass.

167
00:08:26,643 --> 00:08:28,310
She's like a fuckin' Cracker Jack box.

168
00:08:28,310 --> 00:08:29,250
- Excuse me?

169
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:30,500
- Can you imagine taking her home

170
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:32,250
in all that baggy shit,
you know what I'm saying?

171
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:33,397
And then finding out what you got.

172
00:08:33,397 --> 00:08:36,620
The surprise in the box.
- Shut up.

173
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:38,712
- Yes?
- Nice hat, Sam.

174
00:08:39,890 --> 00:08:40,722
- Thank you.

175
00:08:42,403 --> 00:08:44,203
- I got a present for you. I forgot.

176
00:08:47,910 --> 00:08:50,140
- Are you looking at my butt?

177
00:08:50,140 --> 00:08:50,973
- No.

178
00:08:51,870 --> 00:08:53,880
Cheryl says you give her dirty looks.

179
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:55,130
- That's 'cause I do.

180
00:08:55,130 --> 00:08:56,676
- Sam.

181
00:08:56,676 --> 00:08:59,001
- But it's so much fun.

182
00:08:59,001 --> 00:09:00,830
- I don't want to hear
about it again tonight.

183
00:09:00,830 --> 00:09:02,900
- What's her face is coming
to my birthday party?

184
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:04,490
Cheryl.

185
00:09:04,490 --> 00:09:06,020
- Whatever.

186
00:09:06,020 --> 00:09:08,760
- It's also her Valentine's
party, remember?

187
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:10,450
So no dirty looks.

188
00:09:10,450 --> 00:09:11,283
- We'll see.

189
00:09:13,088 --> 00:09:14,270
I didn't wrap 'em.

190
00:09:14,270 --> 00:09:15,103
- Holy shit!

191
00:09:16,830 --> 00:09:18,204
Thanks.

192
00:09:20,490 --> 00:09:21,323
Oh boy.

193
00:09:22,898 --> 00:09:24,080
Sam, your date is here.

194
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,943
- Shut up!
- Let's get ready!

195
00:09:28,050 --> 00:09:29,300
- Lucky bastard.

196
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:30,170
- Shut up.

197
00:09:30,170 --> 00:09:31,930
- Dude, he gonna tax that booty.

198
00:09:31,930 --> 00:09:32,763
- Stop it, man.

199
00:09:35,980 --> 00:09:36,813
- Hi.

200
00:09:36,813 --> 00:09:37,700
- Sam.

201
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:40,910
Happy birthday. You look great.

202
00:09:40,910 --> 00:09:43,770
This is Joe who was
expecting so much more.

203
00:09:43,770 --> 00:09:45,023
Familiarize yourselves.

204
00:09:45,887 --> 00:09:46,930
- Hi.
- Hi.

205
00:09:46,930 --> 00:09:47,790
You can...

206
00:09:48,879 --> 00:09:50,220
- Wait, wait.

207
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:51,700
- Mikey.
- Happy birthday.

208
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:52,533
- Thank you.

209
00:09:56,077 --> 00:09:57,160
- What is it?

210
00:10:08,429 --> 00:10:10,410
- You know, Sam, I really admire

211
00:10:10,410 --> 00:10:12,810
how you wear all these weird clothes.

212
00:10:12,810 --> 00:10:14,243
I would never have the guts.

213
00:10:15,610 --> 00:10:19,629
- Yeah, well the hat was a
birthday present from my buddy.

214
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,373
- Sam, I think that
had looks sweet on you.

215
00:10:22,373 --> 00:10:23,830
Is that what you got her?

216
00:10:23,830 --> 00:10:24,663
- Yep.

217
00:10:25,830 --> 00:10:26,663
- I like it.

218
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:28,573
Really.

219
00:10:29,530 --> 00:10:31,973
Thanks.

220
00:10:34,262 --> 00:10:35,475
- Yeah!

221
00:10:35,475 --> 00:10:36,474
Did you pass wind?

222
00:10:36,474 --> 00:10:37,660
- No.

223
00:10:37,660 --> 00:10:40,850
- Did someone here, um, pass wind

224
00:10:40,850 --> 00:10:42,113
without saying excuse me?

225
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:50,918
- Excuse me.

226
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:54,950
Okay, call me a buzzkiller,

227
00:10:54,950 --> 00:10:57,380
but aren't we supposed
to be playing a game?

228
00:10:57,380 --> 00:10:58,213
Man, you got a great play. Play.

229
00:10:58,213 --> 00:11:00,760
- Hold on, hold on, I'm
with it. Don't tell me.

230
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:01,790
Let him think.

231
00:11:01,790 --> 00:11:02,940
19 points.

232
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:04,600
Triple letter.

233
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:06,826
- Shit, what is it?
- Starts with a B.

234
00:11:07,659 --> 00:11:08,542
- Hang on, hang on. I got it.

235
00:11:08,542 --> 00:11:09,832
All right, here comes the genius.

236
00:11:09,832 --> 00:11:10,665
- Oh yeah.
- Stand back.

237
00:11:10,665 --> 00:11:12,253
He's dangerous when he's thinkin',

238
00:11:12,253 --> 00:11:14,586
- All right. Check this out.

239
00:11:16,690 --> 00:11:17,660
Check this out.

240
00:11:17,660 --> 00:11:19,365
Read 'em and weep.

241
00:11:19,365 --> 00:11:20,863
Boobies.

242
00:11:20,863 --> 00:11:22,198
Mm.
- Ooh.

243
00:11:22,198 --> 00:11:23,390
Big w-

244
00:11:23,390 --> 00:11:24,223
Pig.

245
00:11:25,854 --> 00:11:28,641
- The key word, Sam, is pig.

246
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:31,873
- It's spelled I-E, Einstein.

247
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:34,000
Let's look it up.

248
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,782
Look it up, look it up.

249
00:11:35,782 --> 00:11:36,649
Look it up.

250
00:11:36,649 --> 00:11:37,482
Let me tell you something,

251
00:11:37,482 --> 00:11:39,847
there is no way that boobies
is in the dictionary, okay?

252
00:11:39,847 --> 00:11:41,487
Oh, come on, everybody says it.

253
00:11:41,487 --> 00:11:43,403
No, you say
it because you are one.

254
00:11:43,403 --> 00:11:44,360
- Ah!
- You got 'em do you'd know.

255
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:46,230
- It's actually in here I can't believe...

256
00:11:46,230 --> 00:11:47,253
Boobies.

257
00:11:48,401 --> 00:11:49,660
But!

258
00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:52,273
Nicole is right, the plural is I-E.

259
00:11:52,273 --> 00:11:54,220
Yeah, Nicole!

260
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:55,590
Sorry, bro.

261
00:11:55,590 --> 00:11:56,780
Hey, they're way behind anyways.

262
00:11:56,780 --> 00:11:58,088
Let's just give it to them.

263
00:11:58,921 --> 00:12:00,421
- Ooh.
- Generous.

264
00:12:07,416 --> 00:12:08,925
What the hell is that?

265
00:12:08,925 --> 00:12:11,013
- Foom-uh-key-us.

266
00:12:12,593 --> 00:12:14,238
- Fumaceous.

267
00:12:14,238 --> 00:12:16,206
- All right, baby.
- That's not a word.

268
00:12:16,206 --> 00:12:17,266
- No, no.
- It's totally.

269
00:12:17,266 --> 00:12:18,360
- It's so a word.

270
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:19,330
- It is.

271
00:12:19,330 --> 00:12:20,610
All right, use it in a sentence.

272
00:12:20,610 --> 00:12:22,410
Thank you.

273
00:12:22,410 --> 00:12:23,720
- Okay.

274
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:25,490
The Scrabble game was going well

275
00:12:25,490 --> 00:12:28,240
until a thick fumaceous cloud escaped

276
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:31,803
from under Peter's ass!

277
00:12:34,054 --> 00:12:35,554
Oh snap!

278
00:13:02,633 --> 00:13:03,569
Dirty man.

279
00:13:03,569 --> 00:13:05,871
Touching me all over.

280
00:13:24,241 --> 00:13:25,321
Yeah, yeah!

281
00:13:25,321 --> 00:13:26,839
You like it like that?

282
00:13:26,839 --> 00:13:28,653
Yeah, you like it like that?

283
00:13:28,653 --> 00:13:31,236
Harder, harder, harder, harder.

284
00:13:52,129 --> 00:13:52,962
- Fuck!

285
00:13:56,445 --> 00:13:57,278
- Sorry.

286
00:13:57,278 --> 00:14:00,804
I'm sorry 'cause I just wet myself.

287
00:14:00,804 --> 00:14:02,170
Did I wake you before?

288
00:14:02,170 --> 00:14:05,130
I couldn't sleep anyway.

289
00:14:05,130 --> 00:14:06,940
- What's her face is louder than Nicole.

290
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:09,960
Are you competing with Peter now or what?

291
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:11,310
- You're hungry?

292
00:14:11,310 --> 00:14:12,210
- What you got?

293
00:14:12,210 --> 00:14:13,860
- Something good.

294
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:14,880
Leftovers.

295
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:17,380
- Mm, what's her face's leftovers?

296
00:14:17,380 --> 00:14:21,831
I'm so honored.

297
00:14:21,831 --> 00:14:23,281
- Do you ever sleep at night?

298
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:25,463
- I work better at night.

299
00:14:26,733 --> 00:14:27,566
Thank you.

300
00:14:27,566 --> 00:14:28,680
- What are you working on?

301
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:31,130
- Art.

302
00:14:31,130 --> 00:14:31,993
- Can I see it?

303
00:14:33,890 --> 00:14:34,803
- When it's done.

304
00:14:36,290 --> 00:14:37,123
Maybe.

305
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:41,200
- How come you never show your work?

306
00:14:42,390 --> 00:14:44,340
- Because it's private.

307
00:14:44,340 --> 00:14:46,190
- That's like me not serving my food.

308
00:14:47,030 --> 00:14:47,863
- Yeah.

309
00:14:48,810 --> 00:14:50,423
But your food is really good.

310
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:53,320
Actually, maybe that's your problem.

311
00:14:55,370 --> 00:14:56,320
- What do you mean?

312
00:14:56,320 --> 00:15:01,320
- Well, it's too good. It's
fuckin' unbelievable, you know?

313
00:15:01,330 --> 00:15:03,530
I mean, maybe you should figure out

314
00:15:03,530 --> 00:15:04,730
whether you're really into the girl

315
00:15:04,730 --> 00:15:06,853
before you seduce her with your food.

316
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:12,170
- You think my food is seductive?

317
00:15:12,170 --> 00:15:14,363
- Yeah, that whosey-what's apparently.

318
00:15:15,551 --> 00:15:16,513
Am I wrong?

319
00:15:19,630 --> 00:15:21,063
So what's the verdict?

320
00:15:23,150 --> 00:15:25,510
You see? That is exactly my point.

321
00:15:25,510 --> 00:15:27,590
You roll your canaloni like the other guys

322
00:15:27,590 --> 00:15:29,594
pitch their bullshit.

323
00:15:29,594 --> 00:15:32,040
- You make me out to be such a dog.

324
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:34,050
- Unintentional dog.

325
00:15:34,050 --> 00:15:35,223
More like a puppy.

326
00:15:36,070 --> 00:15:37,949
That pees on everything.

327
00:15:49,569 --> 00:15:52,680
- I'm tired of searching for it, Sam.

328
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:54,230
- You're just looking too hard.

329
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:56,963
- Maybe I should quit looking, like you.

330
00:15:57,890 --> 00:15:59,820
- That's not the point.

331
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:01,220
I'm happy.

332
00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:03,630
Anyway, I don't need anybody

333
00:16:03,630 --> 00:16:07,213
because I got you, you buddy.

334
00:16:18,468 --> 00:16:19,720
I love you, sweetheart.

335
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:21,130
- Hey Peter.

336
00:16:21,130 --> 00:16:22,060
I need a ride.

337
00:16:22,060 --> 00:16:23,623
Hurry up man 'cause I'm late!

338
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:34,650
- Wow! You gotta get
that muffler fixed, man!

339
00:16:34,650 --> 00:16:36,248
- Hey man, I made her that way.

340
00:16:45,610 --> 00:16:47,192
- Come on, I thought you were late.

341
00:16:47,192 --> 00:16:48,330
- Hey, hey, hey, man. Hey.

342
00:16:48,330 --> 00:16:49,913
Roxanne is my girl, okay?

343
00:16:49,913 --> 00:16:52,996
I gotta warm her up a little
bit before I drive her.

344
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,623
- Why do all your women
have to be so loud?

345
00:16:56,623 --> 00:16:57,600
- Ah!

346
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,660
I wonder if Sam is loud , huh?
- Oh not again.

347
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:01,280
- Dude, it's bad, man. It's bad.

348
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:03,657
All right, last night, right?
- Just stop it, okay?

349
00:17:03,657 --> 00:17:05,450
- I'm fucking her from behind.

350
00:17:05,450 --> 00:17:06,282
- Sam?

351
00:17:06,282 --> 00:17:07,770
- That's what I'm getting at, bro.

352
00:17:07,770 --> 00:17:10,310
The whole time I'm just
dreaming that it's Sam.

353
00:17:10,310 --> 00:17:11,210
That's enough!

354
00:17:11,210 --> 00:17:12,242
- What are you so touchy about?

355
00:17:12,242 --> 00:17:14,849
- Listen, man, Sam is
like a sister to me, okay?

356
00:17:14,849 --> 00:17:16,560
And I don't appreciate your dick

357
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:18,671
and Sam in the same fantasy.

358
00:17:18,671 --> 00:17:19,973
Now just go and shut up.

359
00:17:25,128 --> 00:17:27,400
I mean, it's just
a filter, but you know.

360
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:29,300
You can work on my car for me.

361
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:31,170
- Really? How much you gonna pay me?

362
00:17:31,170 --> 00:17:32,003
- Sam.

363
00:17:32,003 --> 00:17:32,836
What are you doing here?
- Hey.

364
00:17:32,836 --> 00:17:36,116
Well, I had to take a bus to
get that part for your car.

365
00:17:36,116 --> 00:17:38,005
You wanna do a movie?

366
00:17:38,005 --> 00:17:40,493
- Well I kinda have plans.

367
00:17:42,232 --> 00:17:43,065
- Yeah.

368
00:17:44,110 --> 00:17:45,620
- Do you need a ride?

369
00:17:45,620 --> 00:17:47,660
- No, I'm cool.

370
00:17:47,660 --> 00:17:48,853
I have plans.

371
00:17:49,690 --> 00:17:50,763
I totally forgot.

372
00:17:51,887 --> 00:17:52,720
No.

373
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:54,030
- Well thanks for getting me in the part.

374
00:17:54,030 --> 00:17:54,873
- No problem.

375
00:17:56,950 --> 00:17:58,903
Well don't keep your plans waiting.

376
00:18:04,890 --> 00:18:06,440
- Kind of slow on those intros.

377
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:09,053
- Yeah.

378
00:18:09,053 --> 00:18:09,886
Whatever.

379
00:18:12,433 --> 00:18:13,266
See you later, Mike.

380
00:18:13,266 --> 00:18:14,099
- See ya, Sam.

381
00:18:17,317 --> 00:18:19,279
- Just for you.
- Oh my gosh.

382
00:18:19,279 --> 00:18:20,529
- Just for you.

383
00:18:21,497 --> 00:18:22,330
- You're amazing.

384
00:18:22,330 --> 00:18:24,065
I can't believe you made
this all by yourself.

385
00:18:24,065 --> 00:18:24,898
Oh.

386
00:18:25,973 --> 00:18:27,539
- Just for you.

387
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:04,030
- Denise.

388
00:19:04,030 --> 00:19:06,793
- Save it and serve it to someone else.

389
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:19,543
- I have a proposition.

390
00:19:22,420 --> 00:19:24,800
- Listen um, I'm flattered,

391
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:27,950
but propositions are
kind of dangerous lately.

392
00:19:27,950 --> 00:19:30,303
- Well this one might be lucrative,

393
00:19:31,710 --> 00:19:34,678
if you can lay your innuendo aside.

394
00:19:35,790 --> 00:19:37,050
- I'm sorry.

395
00:19:37,050 --> 00:19:39,847
- You have such a nice image, Daniel,

396
00:19:39,847 --> 00:19:42,800
but you're wasting it on small numbers.

397
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:45,103
- Thanks, but-
- We could fix all that.

398
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:47,830
- I don't get it.

399
00:19:48,690 --> 00:19:51,270
Is this a pitch?

400
00:19:53,110 --> 00:19:56,310
- Oh, it's a bitch of a pitch,

401
00:19:56,310 --> 00:20:00,836
and I'm just the witch to turn
your pumpkin into a Ferrari.

402
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:11,473
- Sam!

403
00:20:11,473 --> 00:20:12,593
- Goodnight, Roxanne.
- Hey!

404
00:20:13,770 --> 00:20:15,430
Why are you so bouncy?

405
00:20:15,430 --> 00:20:16,870
- He just got a TV show.

406
00:20:16,870 --> 00:20:17,770
- You got a what?

407
00:20:17,770 --> 00:20:19,150
- Some producer took my class

408
00:20:19,150 --> 00:20:20,750
and she wants me to do it on TV.

409
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,371
- He means cook.

410
00:20:23,371 --> 00:20:24,480
- I got that.

411
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:25,610
- Where? When?

412
00:20:25,610 --> 00:20:27,950
- Here in LA, next week.

413
00:20:27,950 --> 00:20:29,672
No way!

414
00:20:29,672 --> 00:20:30,953
Get the shit off of me! Oh!

415
00:20:31,990 --> 00:20:34,310
- Listen, you buddy, you're
gonna be in the cash.

416
00:20:34,310 --> 00:20:35,650
You're gonna be all set now.

417
00:20:35,650 --> 00:20:37,943
Promise you won't forget
us when you get all big.

418
00:20:37,943 --> 00:20:41,050
- They're just testing
me. Nothing for sure yet.

419
00:20:41,050 --> 00:20:44,062
- Promise me you won't get fat headed.

420
00:20:44,062 --> 00:20:44,895
- I pro-

421
00:20:44,895 --> 00:20:46,860
Are you crazy? Of course I won't.

422
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:48,720
I promise.

423
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:52,230
- Hey, I got a bottle of
champagne I bought for my girl.

424
00:20:52,230 --> 00:20:54,310
- You bought champagne for Nicole?

425
00:20:54,310 --> 00:20:55,860
- No. Hell no.

426
00:20:55,860 --> 00:20:57,783
Roxanne's about to hit 100,000.

427
00:21:00,706 --> 00:21:03,465
♪ Roxanne is about to hit 100,000 ♪

428
00:21:03,465 --> 00:21:07,462
♪ Roxanne is about to hit ♪

429
00:21:17,419 --> 00:21:18,970
- I can't do it.
- Stop schiptzing.

430
00:21:18,970 --> 00:21:21,120
If you go out looking like
that, I'm out of a job.

431
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:23,212
- I look bad?
- Five minutes, kids.

432
00:21:23,212 --> 00:21:25,060
- Oh no.
- You're bugging me.

433
00:21:25,060 --> 00:21:25,893
- Please.

434
00:21:25,893 --> 00:21:28,790
- Look, I gave you neutral
blue number one, hon.

435
00:21:28,790 --> 00:21:30,943
God can't do it better.

436
00:21:30,943 --> 00:21:32,250
- Not the makeup...

437
00:21:32,250 --> 00:21:33,380
- Okay.

438
00:21:33,380 --> 00:21:34,610
All right.

439
00:21:34,610 --> 00:21:35,810
Close your eyes.

440
00:21:35,810 --> 00:21:37,453
Do a little visualizing.

441
00:21:38,530 --> 00:21:40,340
You're in your mother's womb.

442
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:41,447
- What?

443
00:21:41,447 --> 00:21:42,355
- Trust me.

444
00:21:42,355 --> 00:21:44,523
I do this with my therapist all the time.

445
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:46,273
- I need Sam.

446
00:21:46,273 --> 00:21:48,800
- Hey, watch the makeup.
- Fuck the makeup!

447
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:51,333
- Okay. He needs to calm down.

448
00:21:54,070 --> 00:21:54,903
- Hello Daniel.

449
00:21:56,130 --> 00:21:57,963
We're live in a minute. All ready?

450
00:21:59,050 --> 00:22:00,213
Let's get on our mark.

451
00:22:06,260 --> 00:22:08,509
Head's up. Watch yourself.

452
00:22:08,509 --> 00:22:09,759
Coming through.

453
00:22:10,894 --> 00:22:12,727
- Oh, thank you, Bobo.

454
00:22:14,423 --> 00:22:15,910
Very good.

455
00:22:15,910 --> 00:22:17,443
Now let's turn up the charm.

456
00:22:18,620 --> 00:22:20,270
Good luck, sweetie.

457
00:22:20,270 --> 00:22:21,103
- Copy that.

458
00:22:21,103 --> 00:22:24,830
And we are alive in five, four, three...

459
00:22:27,860 --> 00:22:30,503
And now our
new show, Cooking For Two.

460
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:34,350
Holy shit.

461
00:22:34,350 --> 00:22:35,223
There he is.

462
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:37,583
- He looks weird.

463
00:22:38,830 --> 00:22:40,513
- The makeup is making him sweat.

464
00:22:42,270 --> 00:22:43,350
- He's panicked.

465
00:22:43,350 --> 00:22:44,183
- He'll be fine.

466
00:22:45,660 --> 00:22:46,493
- Welcome.

467
00:22:48,020 --> 00:22:51,320
This is um, Cooking For...

468
00:22:52,820 --> 00:22:53,653
For Two.

469
00:22:53,653 --> 00:22:54,740
- Can this guy read?

470
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:55,620
Look at him.

471
00:22:55,620 --> 00:22:57,180
- And uh, I'm...

472
00:22:58,300 --> 00:23:00,333
- He can't remember his own name.

473
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:02,180
- I'm Daniel.

474
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:04,240
- Christ, how many minutes to break?

475
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:05,073
- Uh, two.

476
00:23:05,073 --> 00:23:06,410
- Well pull back for God's sakes.

477
00:23:06,410 --> 00:23:09,010
This isn't a show about his fuckin' sweat.

478
00:23:09,010 --> 00:23:12,270
- Well, and um, let's, let's get started.

479
00:23:12,270 --> 00:23:13,840
First, get the olive oil.

480
00:23:16,552 --> 00:23:17,570
I love olive oil.

481
00:23:17,570 --> 00:23:18,970
- He looks weird.

482
00:23:18,970 --> 00:23:21,110
- Is he reading something?

483
00:23:21,110 --> 00:23:22,380
- Butter.

484
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:23,504
Oh. The stock.

485
00:23:23,504 --> 00:23:24,810
Ow!

486
00:23:24,810 --> 00:23:26,170
Stock.

487
00:23:26,170 --> 00:23:27,665
That's what you got this for.

488
00:23:27,665 --> 00:23:28,498
Ah.

489
00:23:32,734 --> 00:23:33,817
I guess um...

490
00:23:36,912 --> 00:23:37,745
Hello?

491
00:23:37,745 --> 00:23:39,300
Hey Jules, yeah.

492
00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:41,350
Nah, we're watching-
- Julie!

493
00:23:41,350 --> 00:23:43,460
- He is seriously losing it here.

494
00:23:43,460 --> 00:23:44,293
- He's wiggin'.

495
00:23:44,293 --> 00:23:45,820
You gotta do something.

496
00:23:45,820 --> 00:23:47,910
- What can I do? The powder's not holding.

497
00:23:47,910 --> 00:23:51,120
- Nobody gives a shit about
his fucking makeup now.

498
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:52,940
- Okay. We don't have to get rude.

499
00:23:52,940 --> 00:23:53,820
- Okay. All right.

500
00:23:53,820 --> 00:23:56,946
Just, just go talk to him.

501
00:23:56,946 --> 00:23:58,000
I'm not a producer.

502
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,350
- They just went to an ad.

503
00:23:59,350 --> 00:24:00,480
- Shit, I have to go.

504
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:01,930
- Just let me talk to him.

505
00:24:01,930 --> 00:24:03,200
- I'll get fired.

506
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:06,056
- In 50 minutes, there's
not gonna be any job.

507
00:24:06,056 --> 00:24:07,910
Don't say it.

508
00:24:07,910 --> 00:24:10,081
I know I'm sweating, okay?

509
00:24:10,081 --> 00:24:11,421
Yeah, watch your back here.

510
00:24:11,421 --> 00:24:12,886
- What?

511
00:24:12,886 --> 00:24:13,874
- Sam.

512
00:24:13,874 --> 00:24:15,010
- Sam?

513
00:24:15,010 --> 00:24:15,843
Sam.

514
00:24:15,843 --> 00:24:16,753
- You're fucking great.

515
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:18,940
- I'm dying.

516
00:24:18,940 --> 00:24:20,380
- Okay, so I'm lying.

517
00:24:20,380 --> 00:24:21,213
Sam?

518
00:24:21,213 --> 00:24:23,563
Okay. You have to
act like you're at home.

519
00:24:24,430 --> 00:24:25,680
- It's not that easy.

520
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:27,410
I'm cooking to three giant cameras.

521
00:24:27,410 --> 00:24:28,350
- Forget about that.

522
00:24:28,350 --> 00:24:29,900
You have to listen to me.

523
00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:31,790
You make the first camera me,

524
00:24:31,790 --> 00:24:36,790
the second camera Peter,
and the third camera Denise.

525
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:38,900
- I broke up with Denise.

526
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:40,970
- Uh, he's on the phone.

527
00:24:40,970 --> 00:24:42,040
- What?
- What?

528
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:43,400
How can you tell?

529
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:44,490
- His mic.

530
00:24:44,490 --> 00:24:46,450
Well that's when
I'm cooking for people.

531
00:24:46,450 --> 00:24:49,160
- Who is this clown
talking to? His mother?

532
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:50,354
- Cut him off.

533
00:24:50,354 --> 00:24:52,130
I can't.

534
00:24:52,130 --> 00:24:53,370
He must be on a cellular.

535
00:24:53,370 --> 00:24:54,350
- Well go and get it.

536
00:24:54,350 --> 00:24:55,690
- We're back in 30 seconds guys.

537
00:24:55,690 --> 00:24:56,880
- Now!

538
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:58,030
I know that.

539
00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:03,670
- Daniel, let's put down the phone now.

540
00:25:03,670 --> 00:25:08,670
- And we're back in
five, four, three, two...

541
00:25:10,555 --> 00:25:11,983
Did you see we
go a show going on here?

542
00:25:11,983 --> 00:25:13,810
Yeah.

543
00:25:13,810 --> 00:25:15,430
Remember the duck and Peter freaking out?

544
00:25:15,430 --> 00:25:17,730
And now
back to Cooking For Two.

545
00:25:19,054 --> 00:25:20,960
- You're on the air.

546
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:21,990
- Huh?

547
00:25:21,990 --> 00:25:23,910
Hold on one sec, Sam.

548
00:25:23,910 --> 00:25:24,743
What'd you say?

549
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:30,553
Oh.

550
00:25:31,490 --> 00:25:32,323
Hey.

551
00:25:33,380 --> 00:25:34,370
- I'm dead.

552
00:25:34,370 --> 00:25:37,080
- I mean, he's my buddy,
but this show is bombin'.

553
00:25:38,890 --> 00:25:42,306
- Oh, I'm talking to my friend Sam here.

554
00:25:42,306 --> 00:25:43,139
Sam?

555
00:25:43,139 --> 00:25:44,713
- Just cook, Daniel.

556
00:25:45,670 --> 00:25:46,503
- He's dead.

557
00:25:46,503 --> 00:25:48,060
- Hey, don't hang up.

558
00:25:48,060 --> 00:25:49,063
- I promise.

559
00:25:50,037 --> 00:25:50,870
- Huh?

560
00:25:52,930 --> 00:25:55,380
- I'm cooking spicy shrimp.

561
00:25:55,380 --> 00:25:56,463
For two of course.

562
00:25:57,336 --> 00:26:00,317
You know, Sam, shrimp are
kind of like relationships:

563
00:26:00,317 --> 00:26:02,411
you strip them of their hard outer shells,

564
00:26:02,411 --> 00:26:05,313
you find these soft,
vulnerable creatures inside

565
00:26:05,313 --> 00:26:08,030
that turn all pink when
you treat 'em right.

566
00:26:08,030 --> 00:26:11,640
- What is this? A show
about Dr. Ruth meets a vein?

567
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:13,580
- He's coming around.

568
00:26:13,580 --> 00:26:14,990
They're kind of like lovers.

569
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:18,236
If you handle them with
respect and you don't rush it,

570
00:26:18,236 --> 00:26:20,610
everything will be fine.

571
00:26:20,610 --> 00:26:22,103
- Is this X-rated or what?

572
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,400
- I'm getting hungry, Peter.

573
00:26:25,686 --> 00:26:26,519
- And horny?

574
00:26:27,694 --> 00:26:28,896
Eh?

575
00:26:28,896 --> 00:26:29,876
Eh?

576
00:26:29,876 --> 00:26:31,530
- Horny?
- Mm, yeah.

577
00:26:31,530 --> 00:26:33,205
Yes, I'm horny, Peter.

578
00:26:33,205 --> 00:26:34,675
Well come here.

579
00:26:34,675 --> 00:26:36,230
- Okay.
- Come here.

580
00:26:36,230 --> 00:26:38,110
- And we're off ladies and gentlemen.

581
00:26:38,110 --> 00:26:39,200
That's a rap, everybody.

582
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:40,740
Who gave Daniel that cell phone?

583
00:26:40,740 --> 00:26:42,893
It's a question. I want an answer.

584
00:26:44,300 --> 00:26:45,820
- Oh, no.

585
00:26:45,820 --> 00:26:47,340
Don't even think about it.

586
00:26:47,340 --> 00:26:48,683
I'm already toast.

587
00:26:52,020 --> 00:26:53,360
- Yes. Can you hold please?

588
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:54,800
Kathryn Hammer's office.

589
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:56,350
Is this like the third time you called?

590
00:26:56,350 --> 00:26:57,520
Girl, you need a life.

591
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:58,830
Kathryn Hammer's office.

592
00:26:58,830 --> 00:26:59,820
I know you called before

593
00:26:59,820 --> 00:27:01,349
but I'm putting you on hold again.

594
00:27:01,349 --> 00:27:03,154
Kathryn Hammer's-
- Morning, Bobo.

595
00:27:05,140 --> 00:27:07,417
- What's all this?
- Your messages.

596
00:27:07,417 --> 00:27:09,060
- Who are they all from?

597
00:27:09,060 --> 00:27:10,370
- Women.

598
00:27:10,370 --> 00:27:11,870
- For me?

599
00:27:11,870 --> 00:27:14,333
- Mm-mm. For that cook of yours.

600
00:27:15,490 --> 00:27:16,580
Kathryn Hammer's office.

601
00:27:16,580 --> 00:27:17,640
Yes. Now can I help you?

602
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:18,830
Uh, just...

603
00:27:18,830 --> 00:27:19,663
- Bobo?
- Hm?

604
00:27:19,663 --> 00:27:20,496
Could you uh...

605
00:27:20,496 --> 00:27:21,329
- Oh, yeah.

606
00:27:21,329 --> 00:27:22,162
Hold on.

607
00:27:23,110 --> 00:27:23,943
Silly me.

608
00:27:26,310 --> 00:27:27,413
- Thank you.

609
00:27:40,747 --> 00:27:44,696
Oh my...

610
00:27:48,660 --> 00:27:51,853
Oh, how sweet.

611
00:27:53,034 --> 00:27:53,951
Oh, Daniel.

612
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:56,183
Come in.

613
00:27:57,060 --> 00:27:59,043
Come on, sit down over here.

614
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:02,993
The phone...

615
00:28:02,993 --> 00:28:04,113
- Listen, I know...

616
00:28:04,113 --> 00:28:05,270
I shouldn't have...

617
00:28:05,270 --> 00:28:06,160
It was not...

618
00:28:08,650 --> 00:28:09,484
I'm fired.

619
00:28:10,317 --> 00:28:11,150
Kathryn.

620
00:28:11,150 --> 00:28:11,983
- Oh.

621
00:28:11,983 --> 00:28:13,470
Come in Bobo.
- I have some more messages.

622
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:16,118
Lots.
- Thank you.

623
00:28:16,118 --> 00:28:18,790
I haven't peed all
day. I'm not a receptionist.

624
00:28:18,790 --> 00:28:21,950
- We've decided to add
the phone to the show.

625
00:28:21,950 --> 00:28:23,119
- So I'm not fired?

626
00:28:23,119 --> 00:28:25,180
No.

627
00:28:25,180 --> 00:28:26,440
- Great.

628
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:28,180
Sam loved doing the show.

629
00:28:28,180 --> 00:28:31,750
- Oh, well that's great,
but she's not on our team.

630
00:28:31,750 --> 00:28:35,470
It seems that every female who
watched the show last night

631
00:28:35,470 --> 00:28:37,463
wants to talk to you on the air,

632
00:28:38,460 --> 00:28:40,503
and talk to you they will.

633
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:44,707
Sign all this and you're rich and famous.

634
00:28:56,443 --> 00:28:59,700
Coming up next,
linguini and love advice

635
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:01,660
on Cooking For Two.

636
00:29:01,660 --> 00:29:03,260
- And how are you today?

637
00:29:04,423 --> 00:29:05,820
- Better.
- You focused?

638
00:29:05,820 --> 00:29:06,653
- I'm focused.

639
00:29:09,950 --> 00:29:10,799
Move the vegetables there, pal.

640
00:29:10,799 --> 00:29:12,563
- You gave him the phone, didn't you?

641
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:15,033
Smart.

642
00:29:15,890 --> 00:29:19,030
- What does smart get me?
- Job security.

643
00:29:19,030 --> 00:29:20,053
- How about a raise?

644
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:25,230
Okay, guess not.

645
00:29:25,230 --> 00:29:27,193
Would you get
the hell out of my way?

646
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:30,130
- Way to go.
- Now Daniel,

647
00:29:30,130 --> 00:29:31,860
when the phone rings, I want you to press

648
00:29:31,860 --> 00:29:33,627
this button right here.

649
00:29:33,627 --> 00:29:34,460
- Okay.

650
00:29:34,460 --> 00:29:35,293
This? Which button?

651
00:29:35,293 --> 00:29:36,126
- This button right here.

652
00:29:36,126 --> 00:29:37,360
- This button?
- Yeah.

653
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:38,560
- Now it's only a prop.

654
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:41,150
It doesn't do anything,
but you just hit it anyway.

655
00:29:41,150 --> 00:29:41,993
- Well, why?

656
00:29:43,950 --> 00:29:46,440
- Act like you at home okay?

657
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:47,273
- Okay.

658
00:29:47,273 --> 00:29:48,110
- We control the phone calls.

659
00:29:48,110 --> 00:29:50,790
You smooth talk to females.

660
00:29:50,790 --> 00:29:55,530
- Darling, did I or didn't I say this kid,

661
00:29:55,530 --> 00:29:57,243
he's gonna be a big hit?

662
00:29:59,340 --> 00:30:00,173
- You didn't.

663
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:06,583
- Okay you, I'm done.

664
00:30:08,829 --> 00:30:09,730
Oh, don't forget.

665
00:30:09,730 --> 00:30:12,451
We're meeting the gang at
the bar tonight to celebrate.

666
00:30:12,451 --> 00:30:14,230
All right people, let's stand by.

667
00:30:14,230 --> 00:30:15,690
- Frank, is this thing live?

668
00:30:15,690 --> 00:30:16,590
All set.

669
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:19,243
Is the phone all set up?

670
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:21,250
- All clear.
- Good.

671
00:30:22,180 --> 00:30:24,670
Daniel, darling, we have 10 seconds.

672
00:30:24,670 --> 00:30:26,630
Cook and charm, my dear.

673
00:30:26,630 --> 00:30:28,700
Tender and intimate.

674
00:30:28,700 --> 00:30:30,520
Keep the calls, short, sweetie.

675
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:33,491
We don't want them
getting pregnant, right?

676
00:30:33,491 --> 00:30:34,324
Good.

677
00:30:34,324 --> 00:30:36,520
- All right, here we go,
ladies and gentlemen.

678
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:40,050
In five, four, three...

679
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:48,510
This is Cooking For Two

680
00:30:48,510 --> 00:30:51,063
with your host, Daniel Haus.

681
00:30:51,990 --> 00:30:54,480
- Welcome. This is Cooking For Two.

682
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:56,993
I'm-

683
00:31:00,077 --> 00:31:01,166
- The phone.

684
00:31:01,166 --> 00:31:03,074
Pick up the phone.

685
00:31:06,300 --> 00:31:07,720
- This is Daniel.

686
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:10,280
Hi um, this is Brenda.

687
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:11,870
I'm calling from Louisville.

688
00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:13,690
- Hi.
- Hi.

689
00:31:13,690 --> 00:31:15,930
Oh, you looked so nervous last night.

690
00:31:15,930 --> 00:31:18,714
I mean, you were so cute
with that accent of yours

691
00:31:18,714 --> 00:31:21,420
and everything like that and
I was just wondering, um,

692
00:31:21,420 --> 00:31:22,553
you got a girl?

693
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:25,205
- No.

694
00:31:25,205 --> 00:31:26,190
Oh.

695
00:31:26,190 --> 00:31:29,240
- Did you go and get the ingredients

696
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:30,400
I told you to get last night?

697
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:31,520
Oh, I sure did.

698
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:34,640
I ran right out and got
everything at the A&P.

699
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:37,260
- And who are we cooking for tonight?

700
00:31:37,260 --> 00:31:39,431
Oh baby.

701
00:31:39,431 --> 00:31:41,963
I am cookin' for you, Silly Billy.

702
00:31:44,690 --> 00:31:47,223
- Well uh, then let's get started.

703
00:31:48,417 --> 00:31:49,717
Maybe with the pasta, huh?

704
00:31:51,588 --> 00:31:53,910
Hey yo, Sam.

705
00:31:53,910 --> 00:31:55,650
You gonna get ready to
go to the bar or what?

706
00:31:55,650 --> 00:31:58,390
- Yeah, I'm ready. Can't you tell?

707
00:31:59,230 --> 00:32:00,260
No, wait for me.

708
00:32:00,260 --> 00:32:01,683
I'm gonna be like two seconds.

709
00:32:01,683 --> 00:32:02,993
- All right.
- Okay?

710
00:32:06,380 --> 00:32:07,633
Cute show today.

711
00:32:10,850 --> 00:32:11,710
- Daniel.

712
00:32:11,710 --> 00:32:13,763
May I introduce Jacqueline Fosburg?

713
00:32:15,220 --> 00:32:16,720
- Hi, I'm Daniel.

714
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:18,530
- Do you have plans for this evening?

715
00:32:18,530 --> 00:32:20,253
- Uh, no.

716
00:32:21,450 --> 00:32:22,540
Nope.

717
00:32:22,540 --> 00:32:24,040
- Will you join me for dinner?

718
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:26,233
- Great.

719
00:32:27,410 --> 00:32:28,630
I'll just change.

720
00:32:28,630 --> 00:32:30,153
- Good.

721
00:32:38,220 --> 00:32:39,053
Sweet.

722
00:32:41,650 --> 00:32:42,483
Woo.

723
00:32:43,398 --> 00:32:45,702
Mademoiselle Fosburg.

724
00:32:45,702 --> 00:32:48,680
It's nice to see you again.
- Thank you, Jacque.

725
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:51,420
Young man, your napkin,

726
00:32:51,420 --> 00:32:52,823
it goes on your lap.

727
00:32:54,104 --> 00:32:54,950
There you go.

728
00:32:54,950 --> 00:32:56,633
- Thank you.
- Bon appetit.

729
00:32:57,680 --> 00:32:59,260
- This is casual, huh?

730
00:32:59,260 --> 00:33:01,420
- They don't require you to wear a tie.

731
00:33:01,420 --> 00:33:02,323
- Oh yeah.

732
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:07,140
Um, so, you work with Kathryn?

733
00:33:07,140 --> 00:33:09,593
- No, she's an old family friend.

734
00:33:11,270 --> 00:33:12,103
- I like her.

735
00:33:12,103 --> 00:33:13,560
- Hm, well don't be fooled.

736
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:14,960
She's a tough cookie.

737
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:16,260
All business.

738
00:33:16,260 --> 00:33:18,447
- Your menus, Ms. Fosburg.
- Thank you.

739
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:21,360
- Are you in the business?

740
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:26,220
- Yes. I just turned
agent with William Morris.

741
00:33:26,220 --> 00:33:27,583
- Wow. How exciting.

742
00:33:27,583 --> 00:33:28,870
- Yeah.

743
00:33:28,870 --> 00:33:30,460
- That's big, right?

744
00:33:30,460 --> 00:33:31,373
- Sometimes.

745
00:33:32,900 --> 00:33:33,803
Very big.

746
00:33:35,660 --> 00:33:37,653
You might consider an agent sooner.

747
00:33:39,940 --> 00:33:41,693
- So is this a in business dinner?

748
00:33:44,890 --> 00:33:46,593
- I didn't intend for it to be.

749
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:50,353
- Unbelievable.

750
00:33:50,353 --> 00:33:53,130
He's not even famous yet
and he's already late.

751
00:33:53,130 --> 00:33:55,543
- Yeah. I guess something came up.

752
00:34:00,490 --> 00:34:01,951
- Men.

753
00:34:01,951 --> 00:34:03,770
- Huh?
- Huh?

754
00:34:03,770 --> 00:34:04,863
Fuck you Peter.

755
00:34:05,764 --> 00:34:06,931
Huh?

756
00:34:10,879 --> 00:34:12,556
Hey, over here buddy.

757
00:34:12,556 --> 00:34:14,663
All I know is she's
definitely acting weird.

758
00:34:14,663 --> 00:34:16,690
- It's the chick thing to do.

759
00:34:16,690 --> 00:34:19,010
- Come on. We're talking about Sam here.

760
00:34:19,010 --> 00:34:20,556
- Maybe she's digging you.

761
00:34:20,556 --> 00:34:21,493
- No way.

762
00:34:21,493 --> 00:34:23,980
- All right, so she's jealous.

763
00:34:23,980 --> 00:34:26,690
- No, I think she's still pissed off.

764
00:34:26,690 --> 00:34:28,889
- Dude, that was over two weeks ago.

765
00:34:28,889 --> 00:34:29,723
- I know.

766
00:34:33,580 --> 00:34:35,500
- I can't believe you
want to pay these prices.

767
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:37,290
I told you later on I'd
hook you up for free, dude.

768
00:34:37,290 --> 00:34:38,650
Zilch. Nada.

769
00:34:38,650 --> 00:34:39,483
Nothin'.

770
00:34:41,949 --> 00:34:43,250
It is you.

771
00:34:43,250 --> 00:34:45,000
You're the cook on my TV.

772
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,800
You're just as pretty as your picture.

773
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:48,800
I shop here all the time. Do you?

774
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:50,730
Can I get you something, ma'am?

775
00:34:50,730 --> 00:34:53,010
- I want your autograph.

776
00:34:53,010 --> 00:34:53,882
- Sure.

777
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:56,273
Um...

778
00:34:56,273 --> 00:34:57,106
- Cynthia.

779
00:34:57,106 --> 00:34:58,413
- To Cynthia.

780
00:34:59,429 --> 00:35:00,484
Okay.

781
00:35:00,484 --> 00:35:02,050
Here you go.

782
00:35:02,050 --> 00:35:03,370
Anyway, I don't know, you know?

783
00:35:03,370 --> 00:35:04,420
Sam is just...

784
00:35:09,050 --> 00:35:10,440
Oh, I gotta go.

785
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:11,817
See you later.

786
00:35:11,817 --> 00:35:14,459
- All right, see you later, Danny Boy.

787
00:35:17,930 --> 00:35:19,691
Woo hoo hoo.
- Don't tickle me.

788
00:35:19,691 --> 00:35:20,813
- You know what I wanna do to them

789
00:35:20,813 --> 00:35:23,621
feet later, don't you?
- I'm trying to go places.

790
00:35:23,621 --> 00:35:24,632
- You're going places all right.

791
00:35:24,632 --> 00:35:25,465
You're gonna go to the bedroom.

792
00:35:25,465 --> 00:35:26,755
No, I'll tell
you where I'm gonna go.

793
00:35:26,755 --> 00:35:28,622
- Woo hoo hoo, yeah,
where are you gonna go?

794
00:35:28,622 --> 00:35:29,911
I'll tell you.

795
00:35:29,911 --> 00:35:30,744
I'll tell you where you're gonna go.

796
00:35:30,744 --> 00:35:32,242
You're...

797
00:35:32,242 --> 00:35:33,683
I wanna go to heaven.

798
00:35:33,683 --> 00:35:34,580
- Yeah, you are.

799
00:35:34,580 --> 00:35:36,950
Oh, Sam yeah, let's bust a three way.

800
00:35:36,950 --> 00:35:37,783
Come on.

801
00:35:37,783 --> 00:35:38,616
You're sick, you fuck!

802
00:35:38,616 --> 00:35:41,476
- Where is the fucking remote, Peter?

803
00:35:44,141 --> 00:35:45,570
- You don't wanna miss loverboy, huh?

804
00:35:45,570 --> 00:35:47,910
- Are you high? Disgusting pig.

805
00:35:47,910 --> 00:35:50,093
- No, he's just jealous, I think.

806
00:35:53,585 --> 00:35:54,798
I'm Daniel Haus.

807
00:35:54,798 --> 00:35:55,796
I hope you all...

00:35:57,959 --> 00:36:02,520

809
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:03,353

- Believe me, it's worth it.

818
00:36:33,487 --> 00:36:36,480
Unlike your traditional long grain rice,

819
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:38,740
first saute the arborio with onion

820
00:36:38,740 --> 00:36:41,683
until it's coated with
olive oil and butter.

821
00:36:44,910 --> 00:36:46,130
Hello?

822
00:36:46,130 --> 00:36:47,830
Hi Daniel.

823
00:36:47,830 --> 00:36:48,663
- Hi.

824
00:36:49,860 --> 00:36:51,890
You sound like you're crying?

825
00:36:51,890 --> 00:36:53,270
It's the onions.

826
00:36:53,270 --> 00:36:55,780
- Well, did you try
keeping them in the fridge?

827
00:36:55,780 --> 00:36:58,500
- Okay, so it's not the onions.

828
00:36:58,500 --> 00:37:00,290
What's your name?

829
00:37:00,290 --> 00:37:01,550
- No.

830
00:37:01,550 --> 00:37:02,820
No names.

831
00:37:02,820 --> 00:37:04,350
- Okay.

832
00:37:04,350 --> 00:37:05,756
What's wrong?

833
00:37:06,675 --> 00:37:08,013
- I'm so lonely.

834
00:37:10,620 --> 00:37:13,190
Well, are you dating anyone?

835
00:37:13,190 --> 00:37:14,023
- No.

836
00:37:15,180 --> 00:37:16,830
Nobody cares.

837
00:37:16,830 --> 00:37:20,560
- Look, patience is the
key to a perfect risotto.

838
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:22,660
Special stuff needs a little extra time.

839
00:37:22,660 --> 00:37:25,360
Like the arborio, you
can't put a lid on it.

840
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:27,263
You must add the stock in slowly,

841
00:37:28,250 --> 00:37:31,733
half a cup at a time, stirring constantly,

842
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:36,490
so by the time the rice
completely absorbs the stock,

843
00:37:36,490 --> 00:37:38,430
it'll separate nicely.

844
00:37:38,430 --> 00:37:40,250
- I couldn't find arborio.

845
00:37:40,250 --> 00:37:41,270
- That's okay.

846
00:37:41,270 --> 00:37:42,650
It'll still work.

847
00:37:42,650 --> 00:37:45,180
And try not to be too hard on yourself.

848
00:37:45,180 --> 00:37:46,810
It doesn't matter.

849
00:37:46,810 --> 00:37:47,823
It's just for me.

850
00:37:49,270 --> 00:37:50,920
- It's all right.

851
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:53,163
It's okay. I understand how you feel.

852
00:37:55,187 --> 00:37:57,027
- He's so sweet.

853
00:37:57,027 --> 00:37:58,340
- You do?

854
00:37:58,340 --> 00:38:00,855
- Of course. We all feel that way.

855
00:38:00,855 --> 00:38:01,950
- He's fuckin' connin' her.

856
00:38:01,950 --> 00:38:02,783
- Shh.
- Shh.

857
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:07,750
- My friend Sam says if
we try too hard, we fail.

858
00:38:07,750 --> 00:38:11,370
We have to stop and let
things rest for a while,

859
00:38:11,370 --> 00:38:14,103
that we know what we
need is really out there.

860
00:38:15,191 --> 00:38:16,591
Or maybe very close to home.

861
00:38:18,353 --> 00:38:20,733
I think I'm finally getting
what Sam really means.

862
00:38:21,630 --> 00:38:22,543
Thanks, Daniel.

863
00:38:23,540 --> 00:38:24,373
- No.

864
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:26,681
Thank you.

865
00:38:26,681 --> 00:38:27,883
Whoops.

866
00:38:28,860 --> 00:38:30,363
I almost burnt the risotto.

867
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:37,833
So?

868
00:38:39,730 --> 00:38:41,150
Did you tell 'em about my cookbook?

869
00:38:41,150 --> 00:38:43,180
- Oh gah, oh my gosh,
are you ready for this?

870
00:38:43,180 --> 00:38:44,370
They loved the idea.

871
00:38:44,370 --> 00:38:45,520
I'm calling some publisher friends

872
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:46,690
when I get back to the office.

873
00:38:46,690 --> 00:38:47,523
And...

874
00:38:50,230 --> 00:38:51,943
Kathryn agreed to the terms.

875
00:38:52,930 --> 00:38:55,393
Read them over. I think you'll be pleased.

876
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:59,304
They're buying me a car?

877
00:38:59,304 --> 00:39:00,633
Oh!

878
00:39:00,633 --> 00:39:01,929
Oh!

879
00:39:01,929 --> 00:39:03,369
Yes!

880
00:39:05,297 --> 00:39:06,347
- And a new wardrobe.

881
00:39:07,580 --> 00:39:09,453
Tomorrow, we shop.

882
00:39:11,780 --> 00:39:12,613
- Hey Sam.

883
00:39:14,396 --> 00:39:15,420
Son.

884
00:39:15,420 --> 00:39:16,710
- Dad.

885
00:39:16,710 --> 00:39:17,543
Hey.

886
00:39:17,543 --> 00:39:19,260
- I didn't know you were coming.

887
00:39:19,260 --> 00:39:21,562
Wanted to surprise you.

888
00:39:21,562 --> 00:39:23,582
- You sure did. You look great.

889
00:39:25,477 --> 00:39:28,570
- And you, my famous son.

890
00:39:28,570 --> 00:39:31,400
Everybody talks about
you at the Lions Club.

891
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:32,233
- Really?

892
00:39:32,233 --> 00:39:33,550
- Especially the wives.

893
00:39:35,150 --> 00:39:37,970
He was always very popular with the girls.

894
00:39:37,970 --> 00:39:39,330
- It's the cooking.

895
00:39:39,330 --> 00:39:40,330
- Yeah, it's...

896
00:39:42,039 --> 00:39:45,040
I'm very glad something has
finally come out of this.

897
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:46,567
- What does that mean?

898
00:39:46,567 --> 00:39:48,700
- I mean, who would have
thought flipping pancakes

899
00:39:48,700 --> 00:39:51,400
would bring you so much money
and put you on television, eh?

900
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:52,590
- That's record breaking, dad.

901
00:39:52,590 --> 00:39:54,252
It only took you three minutes
to bring up these insults.

902
00:39:54,252 --> 00:39:55,549
- Not even. Why are you doing?

903
00:39:55,549 --> 00:39:57,010
- What do you mean, because-
- I am just trying

904
00:39:57,010 --> 00:39:58,620
to congratulate you.
- Oh come on, dad.

905
00:39:58,620 --> 00:40:01,420
Save your Old World sense
of humor for the Lions Club.

906
00:40:01,420 --> 00:40:02,750
I know you too well.

907
00:40:02,750 --> 00:40:05,540
- Yeah, oh, you know
me? That is ridiculous.

908
00:40:05,540 --> 00:40:07,188
I never see you anymore.
- Oh, and that's my fault?

909
00:40:07,188 --> 00:40:08,230
- I never see him.
- Oh, that's my fault?

910
00:40:08,230 --> 00:40:09,063
He never visits me.

911
00:40:09,063 --> 00:40:09,896
Come on dad, give me a break.

912
00:40:09,896 --> 00:40:10,729
What?

913
00:40:10,729 --> 00:40:11,800
- You just show up now?

914
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:12,820
- Hey, I'm starving.

915
00:40:12,820 --> 00:40:15,160
Will you fix us something to eat?

916
00:40:15,160 --> 00:40:18,230
- No, I could take us to
a nice restaurant, hm?

917
00:40:18,230 --> 00:40:19,910
- Still can't see me wearing an apron.

918
00:40:19,910 --> 00:40:21,180
- No.
- Daniel, please.

919
00:40:21,180 --> 00:40:22,990
- No, why are you making the fight?

920
00:40:22,990 --> 00:40:24,840
- I, I'm sorry guys.

921
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:25,673
I have plans.

922
00:40:25,673 --> 00:40:27,340
Jacqueline is picking me up any minute.

923
00:40:27,340 --> 00:40:28,930
- I want, I want to talk to you

924
00:40:28,930 --> 00:40:30,500
about something very important.

925
00:40:30,500 --> 00:40:31,620
- Well I've heard enough!

926
00:40:31,620 --> 00:40:34,830
- Don't you walk away from
me when I am talking to you.

927
00:40:34,830 --> 00:40:36,981
I am still your father, Daniel!

928
00:40:36,981 --> 00:40:37,814
- Still?

929
00:40:39,010 --> 00:40:39,963
Still.

930
00:40:42,460 --> 00:40:43,960
When were you?

931
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:44,853
- Oh, who are you to talk?

932
00:40:44,853 --> 00:40:47,160
Pffht. I have a daughter for a son.

933
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:48,870
- Stop it!

934
00:40:48,870 --> 00:40:52,040
Daniel, please.
- No, it's all right.

935
00:40:52,040 --> 00:40:52,873
It's all right.

936
00:40:53,810 --> 00:40:55,460
Do you know the number for a cab?

937
00:40:58,560 --> 00:40:59,790
- Just let it go.

938
00:40:59,790 --> 00:41:02,020
He doesn't understand.

939
00:41:02,020 --> 00:41:03,470
- I'm glad you agree.

940
00:41:03,470 --> 00:41:05,253
- No, listen to me.

941
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:07,073
Daniel.

942
00:41:09,156 --> 00:41:10,163
Lose the vest.

943
00:41:16,250 --> 00:41:18,630
- So, how do I look?

944
00:41:18,630 --> 00:41:19,910
- Different.

945
00:41:19,910 --> 00:41:22,430
- Good different or bad different?

946
00:41:22,430 --> 00:41:24,300
- You look fine.

947
00:41:24,300 --> 00:41:25,850
- Fine.

948
00:41:25,850 --> 00:41:28,200
Do you have any idea how
much this stuff costs?

949
00:41:29,053 --> 00:41:32,754
- No, but I'm sure you're gonna tell me.

950
00:41:34,610 --> 00:41:37,140
Hey, I was watching your show last night.

951
00:41:37,140 --> 00:41:38,130
Of course.

952
00:41:38,130 --> 00:41:39,600
- Oh.

953
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:41,520
Right, I was talking about you.

954
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:43,680
- Yeah.
- I hope you don't mind.

955
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:44,840
- Mind?

956
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:45,970
No.

957
00:41:45,970 --> 00:41:47,893
- There's something I
wanted to tell you, Sam.

958
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:50,240
- What is it?

959
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:52,359
You could tell me anything, you know that.

960
00:41:56,230 --> 00:41:57,130
- It's Jacqueline.

961
00:42:03,650 --> 00:42:05,040
Oh.

962
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:06,634
I got you somethin'.

963
00:42:06,634 --> 00:42:08,820
It's kind of cute, huh?

964
00:42:08,820 --> 00:42:10,673
- Yeah, it's, it's cute.

965
00:42:11,661 --> 00:42:12,494
Is this it?

966
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:18,510
I finished my sculpture last night.

967
00:42:18,510 --> 00:42:19,573
- Wow. That's great.

968
00:42:21,360 --> 00:42:22,911
- I know you want to see it.

969
00:42:24,450 --> 00:42:25,320
Just let her sit.

970
00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:26,223
She can wait.

971
00:42:27,350 --> 00:42:29,243
- Another time, okay?

972
00:42:29,243 --> 00:42:30,076
Gotta go.

973
00:42:34,662 --> 00:42:35,495
Thanks.

974
00:42:40,231 --> 00:42:42,342
Let me give you my jacket.

975
00:42:42,342 --> 00:42:43,299
I've got goosebumps.

976
00:42:50,454 --> 00:42:51,537
- Jacqueline.

977
00:42:52,687 --> 00:42:54,687

- More than enough.

1004
00:44:10,580 --> 00:44:12,095
I wanna cook us something special.

1005
00:44:12,928 --> 00:44:13,887
- Mmm.

1006
00:44:13,887 --> 00:44:16,110
- You know, Cooking For Two?

1007
00:44:16,110 --> 00:44:18,503
I'm getting rusty at it for real.

1008
00:44:18,503 --> 00:44:22,380
- Mmm, so sweet, but I only have coffee

1009
00:44:22,380 --> 00:44:23,970
and Perrier in the fridge.

1010
00:44:23,970 --> 00:44:25,620
And besides, um, I've made reservations

1011
00:44:25,620 --> 00:44:27,610
and we're meeting some friends.

1012
00:44:27,610 --> 00:44:29,880
You cook too much as it is.

1013
00:44:29,880 --> 00:44:32,743
Our money buys us the great chefs.

1014
00:44:33,730 --> 00:44:35,840
Oh. Would you put that
suit on that I love?

1015
00:44:35,840 --> 00:44:37,870
- Cheers.
- Cheers to Daniel,

1016
00:44:37,870 --> 00:44:42,303
to the show, to the lack of
room in my closet.

1017
00:44:48,613 --> 00:44:50,090
- Excuse me? Excuse me?

1018
00:44:50,090 --> 00:44:51,470
Can I have your autograph, please?

1019
00:44:51,470 --> 00:44:53,810
- See? I told you to bring the pictures.

1020
00:44:53,810 --> 00:44:54,643
Very good.

1021
00:45:39,240 --> 00:45:40,660
- Hi.

1022
00:45:40,660 --> 00:45:41,510
- Yeah?

1023
00:45:41,510 --> 00:45:43,420
- I'd like to rent the space.

1024
00:45:43,420 --> 00:45:45,470
- Don't you want to see it first?

1025
00:45:45,470 --> 00:45:46,670
- No.

1026
00:45:46,670 --> 00:45:48,490
Feels right to me.

1027
00:45:48,490 --> 00:45:50,490
Is it okay if I don't smoke?

1028
00:45:50,490 --> 00:45:51,740
- Right on.

1029
00:45:51,740 --> 00:45:52,573
Come on in.

1030
00:45:58,336 --> 00:46:01,340
Welcome to the
show of rice and romance.

1031
00:46:01,340 --> 00:46:02,663
It's Cooking For Two.

1032
00:46:03,670 --> 00:46:04,700
Turn it off!

1033
00:46:04,700 --> 00:46:06,250
- No, I'm cookin' here.

1034
00:46:06,250 --> 00:46:07,690
I'll bet your
kitchen smells amazing.

1035
00:46:07,690 --> 00:46:09,090
- Is that what that is?

1036
00:46:09,090 --> 00:46:11,550
Nicole, you must be thrilled.

1037
00:46:11,550 --> 00:46:13,599
- You know, all you gotta
do is say the word Samantha,

1038
00:46:13,599 --> 00:46:14,972
and I'm all yours.

1039
00:46:14,972 --> 00:46:16,440
- The way you say my name.

1040
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:17,500
- Turns you on, huh?

1041
00:46:17,500 --> 00:46:19,479
- Yeah, I'm hard.

1042
00:46:19,479 --> 00:46:20,683
- I just lost my appetite.

1043
00:46:23,610 --> 00:46:24,850
] So now we should be ready

1044
00:46:24,850 --> 00:46:26,350
to put the pasta in the water.

1045
00:46:33,070 --> 00:46:34,920
- Are you an artist?

1046
00:46:34,920 --> 00:46:36,050
- No.

1047
00:46:36,050 --> 00:46:37,230
Are you?

1048
00:46:37,230 --> 00:46:38,730
- I fix cars.

1049
00:46:38,730 --> 00:46:42,510
I mess around with art a little bit.

1050
00:46:42,510 --> 00:46:45,660
Peter's a butcher and
he's a total fuckin' slob

1051
00:46:45,660 --> 00:46:47,750
but he boosts meat
regularly from his store

1052
00:46:47,750 --> 00:46:50,090
and we really make out protein wise.

1053
00:46:50,090 --> 00:46:51,770
Are you an actor?

1054
00:46:51,770 --> 00:46:53,270
- No.

1055
00:46:53,270 --> 00:46:54,323
I'm a vegetarian.

1056
00:46:55,810 --> 00:46:57,593
But I binge on fish and chicken.

1057
00:46:58,710 --> 00:47:01,250
I'm really tidy, too. Do you mind?

1058
00:47:01,250 --> 00:47:02,083
- Hm.

1059
00:47:02,920 --> 00:47:05,853
That's okay, 'cause nobody
matches here anyway.

1060
00:47:09,010 --> 00:47:09,843
- Come on in.

1061
00:47:13,490 --> 00:47:15,020
- Wow.

1062
00:47:15,020 --> 00:47:15,893
Hello.

1063
00:47:17,831 --> 00:47:18,664
Hm.

1064
00:47:18,664 --> 00:47:20,080
- Some of the students let me keep them.

1065
00:47:20,080 --> 00:47:21,170
- You teach?

1066
00:47:21,170 --> 00:47:23,353
- No. I work as a nude model.

1067
00:47:24,420 --> 00:47:26,940
Oh.

1068
00:47:26,940 --> 00:47:28,263
Okay.

1069
00:47:29,560 --> 00:47:31,010
Wow.

1070
00:47:31,010 --> 00:47:33,480
Okay. I gotta ask you this question.

1071
00:47:33,480 --> 00:47:37,420
Do you ever get uh, bored or cold or...

1072
00:47:38,610 --> 00:47:40,231
Aroused?

1073
00:47:42,310 --> 00:47:44,180
Is that like ha ha ha caught me

1074
00:47:44,180 --> 00:47:47,480
or is that the lamest question?

1075
00:47:47,480 --> 00:47:49,963
- Have you ever taken
a life drawing class?

1076
00:47:50,900 --> 00:47:51,980
- Nope.

1077
00:47:51,980 --> 00:47:53,630
- You should sketch.

1078
00:47:53,630 --> 00:47:56,540
- I don't draw anymore.

1079
00:47:56,540 --> 00:47:58,180
- Why not?

1080
00:47:58,180 --> 00:47:59,840
- Why should I?

1081
00:47:59,840 --> 00:48:00,840
- I see.

1082
00:48:00,840 --> 00:48:03,200
You're not into bodies, right?

1083
00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:06,061
In fact, the wrong ones
keep getting in your way

1084
00:48:06,061 --> 00:48:07,863
and the right one, he ignores you.

1085
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:09,883
- Jesus.

1086
00:48:11,330 --> 00:48:14,693
Are you a psychic or
am I just that obvious?

1087
00:48:15,800 --> 00:48:16,763
- Little of both.

1088
00:48:42,910 --> 00:48:43,743
- Hello?

1089
00:48:48,730 --> 00:48:50,837
Who are
we waking at this hour?

1090
00:48:52,589 --> 00:48:54,657
- Just an old friend.

1091
00:48:54,657 --> 00:48:56,257
But it's too late to bother her.

1092
00:48:57,466 --> 00:49:01,354
- An old friend, or an old lover friend?

1093
00:49:02,470 --> 00:49:03,303
- Sam.

1094
00:49:04,460 --> 00:49:06,173
I've mentioned here before.

1095
00:49:06,173 --> 00:49:07,400
- Hm.

1096
00:49:07,400 --> 00:49:10,347
I thought Sam never sleeps.

1097
00:49:11,180 --> 00:49:12,130
I can't believe you've known a woman

1098
00:49:12,130 --> 00:49:14,610
for that long without having her.

1099
00:49:14,610 --> 00:49:15,710
- She's like a sister.

1100
00:49:17,219 --> 00:49:20,233
- If you were my brother,
there'd be incest in the family.

1101
00:49:24,170 --> 00:49:26,720
So you're back to the cookbook, huh?

1102
00:49:26,720 --> 00:49:29,090
Or are you too excited to sleep?

1103
00:49:29,090 --> 00:49:31,103
- I missed cooking in a real kitchen.

1104
00:49:32,690 --> 00:49:33,692
- Cooking.

1105
00:49:33,692 --> 00:49:38,692
Hm.

1106
00:49:48,969 --> 00:49:50,364
- You're not hungry?

1107
00:49:50,364 --> 00:49:51,197
- No.

1108
00:49:53,608 --> 00:49:56,720
I'm very, very, very, very, very,

1109
00:49:56,720 --> 00:49:58,270
very, very, very...

1110
00:49:58,270 --> 00:49:59,520
Hungry, hungry.

1111
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:10,291
- Yeah?

1112
00:50:10,291 --> 00:50:12,407
It's 12:15.

1113
00:50:12,407 --> 00:50:13,820
- Oh shit. I overslept.

1114
00:50:13,820 --> 00:50:15,990
I'll make
excuses. Just hurry up.

1115
00:50:15,990 --> 00:50:17,090
- I'll be right there.

1116
00:50:22,097 --> 00:50:23,347
Hey.

1117
00:50:32,030 --> 00:50:32,863
- Danny.

1118
00:50:33,987 --> 00:50:34,862
Hi.

1119
00:50:35,960 --> 00:50:37,926
This is Jennifer Beck.
- Hello.

1120
00:50:39,190 --> 00:50:41,452
And Michael Stark.

1121
00:50:42,285 --> 00:50:43,743
- Hey.
- With Burtoch and Lowe.

1122
00:50:44,620 --> 00:50:45,790
- Um, I'm sorry guys.

1123
00:50:45,790 --> 00:50:47,040
I was hung up at the studio.

1124
00:50:47,040 --> 00:50:49,862
- Oh, no problem, Danny.
We were in good hands.

1125
00:50:49,862 --> 00:50:51,760
We were, we were.

1126
00:50:51,760 --> 00:50:54,010
Um, Danny, Jennifer here has written

1127
00:50:54,010 --> 00:50:55,380
several cookbooks for us.

1128
00:50:55,380 --> 00:50:57,590
I think you'll be pleased.

1129
00:51:00,240 --> 00:51:02,060
- Yeah. I've, I've read them.

1130
00:51:02,060 --> 00:51:03,530
- I adore your show.

1131
00:51:03,530 --> 00:51:06,430
The extended hour format, it's a first.

1132
00:51:06,430 --> 00:51:08,686
The time flies between
the sex and scallopini.

1133
00:51:09,519 --> 00:51:10,436
- Oh Jen...

1134
00:51:11,950 --> 00:51:12,783
- She's right, she's right.

1135
00:51:12,783 --> 00:51:13,730
Please, Danny, sit.

1136
00:51:13,730 --> 00:51:14,563
Sit.

1137
00:51:15,890 --> 00:51:16,773
- Calm down?

1138
00:51:17,990 --> 00:51:19,330
Calm down.

1139
00:51:19,330 --> 00:51:21,930
You agreed to a ghostwriter
to write my cookbook.

1140
00:51:21,930 --> 00:51:24,120
- You're going to oversee the project.

1141
00:51:24,120 --> 00:51:25,963
- Oh, that's great. The project.

1142
00:51:26,830 --> 00:51:29,270
Do you have any idea how long
it took me to write this book?

1143
00:51:29,270 --> 00:51:32,320
- Exactly. And you don't have
that kind of time anymore.

1144
00:51:32,320 --> 00:51:34,280
- Well, I'll make the time.

1145
00:51:34,280 --> 00:51:35,890
- Danny, we are professionals.

1146
00:51:35,890 --> 00:51:37,900
We have just pulled off
the coup of the decade.

1147
00:51:37,900 --> 00:51:39,410
Does Julia Child cook for an hour

1148
00:51:39,410 --> 00:51:40,950
five days a week coast to coast?

1149
00:51:40,950 --> 00:51:44,560
You've given single women
more reason to live.

1150
00:51:44,560 --> 00:51:45,720
Who knows, down the road,

1151
00:51:45,720 --> 00:51:48,363
you could try your hand at governor.

1152
00:51:50,580 --> 00:51:52,270
Danny, honey.

1153
00:51:52,270 --> 00:51:53,790
Don't be upset.

1154
00:51:53,790 --> 00:51:55,570
We're just beginning to make our waves.

1155
00:51:55,570 --> 00:51:59,383
Trust me. I am into you
for far more than just 10%.

1156
00:52:00,713 --> 00:52:02,003
- Then you should've told me.

1157
00:52:08,110 --> 00:52:09,640
- Danny. I'm sorry.

1158
00:52:09,640 --> 00:52:12,120
I will never cut a deal
against your interests

1159
00:52:13,092 --> 00:52:15,050
or keep you in the dark.

1160
00:52:15,050 --> 00:52:15,883
Okay?

1161
00:52:30,410 --> 00:52:31,760
See you tonight.

1162
00:52:31,760 --> 00:52:32,693
- Sure.
- Okay.

1163
00:52:39,751 --> 00:52:41,011
- Come on.

1164
00:52:42,190 --> 00:52:43,213
Come on, be home.

1165
00:52:46,240 --> 00:52:47,300
The
number you have dialed

1166
00:52:47,300 --> 00:52:49,313
has been disconnected.

1167
00:52:49,313 --> 00:52:50,146
- Great.

1168
00:52:55,697 --> 00:52:57,986
- I've lost my mind.

1169
00:53:12,940 --> 00:53:13,903
I'll get it.

1170
00:53:16,068 --> 00:53:16,901
- Okay.

1171
00:53:29,590 --> 00:53:30,423
- Hi.

1172
00:53:31,410 --> 00:53:33,213
- Oh. Excuse me.

1173
00:53:34,050 --> 00:53:35,190
Delivery.

1174
00:53:35,190 --> 00:53:36,140
- Samantha.

1175
00:53:36,140 --> 00:53:37,800
Did you order any groceries?

1176
00:53:37,800 --> 00:53:39,640
- With what money?

1177
00:53:39,640 --> 00:53:41,038
- Sorry, man.

1178
00:53:41,038 --> 00:53:42,945
- I must've come to the wrong place.

1179
00:53:46,259 --> 00:53:47,092
Oh geez.

1180
00:54:00,470 --> 00:54:02,730
- You fucked me up.

1181
00:54:02,730 --> 00:54:05,870
You must have scared the
shit out of that guy.

1182
00:54:05,870 --> 00:54:08,072
- Yeah. He seemed a little upset.

1183
00:54:27,260 --> 00:54:28,640
- 'Cause I think they shut it off.

1184
00:54:28,640 --> 00:54:30,760
- Goddammit, I got a 911 page!

1185
00:54:30,760 --> 00:54:31,830
- Don't start with me.

1186
00:54:31,830 --> 00:54:34,275
I told you to pay the bill.

1187
00:54:34,275 --> 00:54:35,550
- Ah, Christ.

1188
00:54:35,550 --> 00:54:37,440
- Just relax.

1189
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:38,273
- Oh, what? With him?

1190
00:54:38,273 --> 00:54:39,570
- I'm drawing him.

1191
00:54:39,570 --> 00:54:40,403
- Whoa, what is that?

1192
00:54:40,403 --> 00:54:41,710
What, does that turn you on, huh?

1193
00:54:41,710 --> 00:54:42,840
- I don't think so.

1194
00:54:42,840 --> 00:54:45,600
I'm not exactly his type,
if you know what I mean.

1195
00:54:45,600 --> 00:54:47,800
- Yeah, well cover your
fuckin' schlong, Walking Bear,

1196
00:54:47,800 --> 00:54:49,350
'cause you ain't turning me on.

1197
00:54:51,620 --> 00:54:53,770
- Well was it Daniel?

1198
00:54:53,770 --> 00:54:54,673
- Is she okay?

1199
00:55:00,649 --> 00:55:01,482
Phew.

1200
00:55:02,630 --> 00:55:04,130
- Which one of you rocket scientists

1201
00:55:04,130 --> 00:55:05,722
left the groceries outside?

1202
00:55:05,722 --> 00:55:06,555
- Food!

1203
00:55:06,555 --> 00:55:07,830
- What, you didn't buy 'em?

1204
00:55:07,830 --> 00:55:09,600
- That guy must've left 'em.

1205
00:55:09,600 --> 00:55:10,433
- What guy?

1206
00:55:10,433 --> 00:55:12,700
- The grocery fairy.

1207
00:55:12,700 --> 00:55:14,730
- Oh, so he was one of your buddies.

1208
00:55:14,730 --> 00:55:16,623
- Hey, easy homophobe.

1209
00:55:20,880 --> 00:55:22,053
Cooking For Two.

1210
00:55:23,677 --> 00:55:25,770
"We cordially invite you and one guest

1211
00:55:25,770 --> 00:55:27,847
to celebrate our 100th show."

1212
00:55:30,670 --> 00:55:31,553
That was Daniel.

1213
00:55:34,494 --> 00:55:35,827
Got me Pringles.

1214
00:55:39,784 --> 00:55:41,784
Whoa, watch out.

1215
00:55:44,401 --> 00:55:45,234
What?

1216
00:55:45,234 --> 00:55:46,830
What is that?

1217
00:55:46,830 --> 00:55:47,730
Evening.

1218
00:56:07,940 --> 00:56:09,780
And there he was so adorable

1219
00:56:09,780 --> 00:56:11,520
teaching his little cooking class

1220
00:56:11,520 --> 00:56:13,806
and charming all the girls.

1221
00:56:15,390 --> 00:56:19,480
- Honey. I can't believe you showed.

1222
00:56:19,480 --> 00:56:20,340
- Yeah.

1223
00:56:20,340 --> 00:56:21,868
Your therapist will be so proud.

1224
00:56:23,180 --> 00:56:24,670
How is he?

1225
00:56:24,670 --> 00:56:25,510
- My therapist?

1226
00:56:25,510 --> 00:56:27,240
He is so fine.

1227
00:56:27,240 --> 00:56:29,790
Moi? I'm completely fabulous also.

1228
00:56:29,790 --> 00:56:31,140
Thanks for asking.

1229
00:56:31,140 --> 00:56:32,920
Things are going really great.

1230
00:56:32,920 --> 00:56:35,670
- Daniel, yoo hoo, sweetheart.

1231
00:56:35,670 --> 00:56:37,500
I have someone I want you to meet.

1232
00:56:37,500 --> 00:56:39,090
This is David Williams.
- Pleasure to meet you.

1233
00:56:39,090 --> 00:56:40,970
- And this is his wife, Britta.

1234
00:56:40,970 --> 00:56:42,060
- Hello.
- My pleasure.

1235
00:56:42,060 --> 00:56:43,133
- This is Daniel.

1236
00:56:45,090 --> 00:56:45,923
- Well...

1237
00:56:48,150 --> 00:56:50,240
Let's go and have a
little drinky, shall we?

1238
00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:51,283
- Yes, please.

1239
00:56:53,100 --> 00:56:55,470
- I see the changes every day.

1240
00:56:55,470 --> 00:56:57,450
Personally, I prefer the perspiration.

1241
00:56:57,450 --> 00:57:00,193
He's become such a pro.

1242
00:57:01,200 --> 00:57:02,033
What can you do?

1243
00:57:03,240 --> 00:57:05,360
- Yeah, well, I'm still worried about him.

1244
00:57:05,360 --> 00:57:06,663
- Who?

1245
00:57:06,663 --> 00:57:07,813
- Oh.
- Hey, Sam.

1246
00:57:07,813 --> 00:57:08,646
- Hi.

1247
00:57:08,646 --> 00:57:09,479
Oh!

1248
00:57:09,479 --> 00:57:11,260
Um Peter.

1249
00:57:11,260 --> 00:57:15,380
You know he's, uh, he's
really freaking out

1250
00:57:15,380 --> 00:57:17,620
ever since Nicole, you know?

1251
00:57:17,620 --> 00:57:18,770
- No, I don't know.

1252
00:57:18,770 --> 00:57:19,703
- Daniel.

1253
00:57:21,570 --> 00:57:23,180
Congratulations.

1254
00:57:23,180 --> 00:57:24,013
- Thank you.

1255
00:57:24,910 --> 00:57:27,040
- Nicole paged him 911.

1256
00:57:27,040 --> 00:57:29,300
- Dumped him over the phone.

1257
00:57:29,300 --> 00:57:30,133
Nice.

1258
00:57:30,970 --> 00:57:33,000
- Well, he wasn't that into her.

1259
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:34,140
- Hello.

1260
00:57:34,140 --> 00:57:37,200
- Well, apparently he was.

1261
00:57:37,200 --> 00:57:40,590
You should call him. He's
really wigged out about this.

1262
00:57:40,590 --> 00:57:42,232
- Yeah, I will.

1263
00:57:42,232 --> 00:57:43,550
You know, I've been so-
- Daniel.

1264
00:57:43,550 --> 00:57:46,690
Congratulations. When are
you coming over for dinner?

1265
00:57:46,690 --> 00:57:49,710
- Well, you've been so busy.

1266
00:57:49,710 --> 00:57:51,350
- I'll call you.
- Good.

1267
00:57:51,350 --> 00:57:53,520
I look forward to it.
- All right.

1268
00:57:58,165 --> 00:57:59,390
- Business.

1269
00:57:59,390 --> 00:58:00,373
Hey, what can I do?

1270
00:58:01,340 --> 00:58:03,173
Sam, I'm really glad you came.

1271
00:58:03,173 --> 00:58:04,006
- Really?

1272
00:58:04,006 --> 00:58:06,770
- You know I've been trying-
- You must be Sam.

1273
00:58:06,770 --> 00:58:08,383
- Yes. This is Jacqueline.

1274
00:58:09,350 --> 00:58:11,130
- Oh, how are you doing?

1275
00:58:11,130 --> 00:58:12,490
- It's nice to meet you finally.

1276
00:58:12,490 --> 00:58:14,260
He's told me so much about you.

1277
00:58:14,260 --> 00:58:15,093
- Yeah.

1278
00:58:15,093 --> 00:58:16,700
- I promised Henry I would take you over

1279
00:58:16,700 --> 00:58:18,143
so you two could meet.

1280
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:21,430
I'm sorry to steal him from you.

1281
00:58:21,430 --> 00:58:22,765
- Oh no.

1282
00:58:22,765 --> 00:58:24,100
It's your party-
- I'll call you.

1283
00:58:24,100 --> 00:58:24,933
- Lady.

1284
00:58:26,920 --> 00:58:29,620
- I tried to tell you.
- I'm so out of here.

1285
00:58:29,620 --> 00:58:32,813
- Come on. Stay for a drink or five.

1286
00:58:34,060 --> 00:58:35,940
Sam, it's my party, too.

1287
00:58:35,940 --> 00:58:38,040
- I'm sorry, Jules. I shouldn't have come.

1288
00:58:39,480 --> 00:58:40,780
Okay.

1289
00:58:40,780 --> 00:58:42,150
We'll get together tomorrow?

1290
00:58:42,150 --> 00:58:43,721
- Yeah.
- All right?

1291
00:58:43,721 --> 00:58:45,054
- I'll call you.

1292
00:58:48,595 --> 00:58:49,770
Nothing, man. That's it.

1293
00:58:49,770 --> 00:58:51,400
You don't what the fucked up thing is?

1294
00:58:51,400 --> 00:58:53,600
Is she goes and pages me to do it.

1295
00:58:53,600 --> 00:58:54,433
- Well, come on.

1296
00:58:54,433 --> 00:58:56,140
That's because you guys
never pay your phone bill.

1297
00:58:56,140 --> 00:58:56,973
- Nah, man. It's not that.

1298
00:58:56,973 --> 00:58:59,150
It's the 911 page, man.

1299
00:58:59,150 --> 00:59:01,220
She gives me a fuckin'
heart attack, you know?

1300
00:59:01,220 --> 00:59:03,210
I mean I'm fuckin' all
worked up and then blam.

1301
00:59:03,210 --> 00:59:05,350
It's no fuckin' emergency. Just this.

1302
00:59:05,350 --> 00:59:07,730
- Hey, maybe she needed
to do it right then.

1303
00:59:07,730 --> 00:59:09,170
- Fuck that shit.

1304
00:59:09,170 --> 00:59:10,060
- Come on Peter.

1305
00:59:10,060 --> 00:59:10,893
It's not as if you were the best

1306
00:59:10,893 --> 00:59:12,630
about calling her back before.

1307
00:59:12,630 --> 00:59:13,600
- Oh, right, oh, what?

1308
00:59:13,600 --> 00:59:15,130
Is this your idea help? Huh?

1309
00:59:15,130 --> 00:59:16,960
'Cause you ain't fuckin' cheering me up.

1310
00:59:16,960 --> 00:59:19,310
- Peter, I don't know what to tell you

1311
00:59:19,310 --> 00:59:20,920
except that it's gonna be okay.

1312
00:59:20,920 --> 00:59:22,670
- Gee. Thanks man.

1313
00:59:22,670 --> 00:59:24,643
You know, I'm so glad I
called you back to get

1314
00:59:24,643 --> 00:59:27,520
that standard line from Dr.
Love of the cooking world.

1315
00:59:27,520 --> 00:59:29,000
Please deposit 25 cents

1316
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:30,673
for the next five minutes,

1317
00:59:32,370 --> 00:59:33,780
- Fuck man, I'm out of change.

1318
00:59:33,780 --> 00:59:35,300
- Just give me the
number on the phone booth

1319
00:59:35,300 --> 00:59:37,488
and I'll call you right back.

1320
00:59:37,488 --> 00:59:39,523
Looks like it's
getting off now. Mhm.

1321
00:59:39,523 --> 00:59:40,356
- 4731.

1322
00:59:41,190 --> 00:59:42,023
All right?

1323
00:59:42,023 --> 00:59:44,153
All right.

1324
00:59:45,300 --> 00:59:46,650
Fuck!

1325
00:59:46,650 --> 00:59:48,600
- Uh, Daniel.
You're needed on the set.

1326
00:59:48,600 --> 00:59:49,850
- Hold on.
- No, no, no, no, no.

1327
00:59:49,850 --> 00:59:51,303
They said now.

1328
01:00:02,200 --> 01:00:03,800
Oh great.

1329
01:00:03,800 --> 01:00:05,540
Hey, you okay?

1330
01:00:05,540 --> 01:00:07,769
- Oh, peachy keen Walking Bear.

1331
01:00:09,779 --> 01:00:11,223
Hey, what the fuck too you so long, huh?

1332
01:00:11,223 --> 01:00:13,270
It's not like I'm sitting
in my living room here, bro.

1333
01:00:13,270 --> 01:00:14,290
I'm gettin' soaked.

1334
01:00:14,290 --> 01:00:15,180
- Peter?

1335
01:00:15,180 --> 01:00:17,000
Hi, this is Bobo.

1336
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:18,450
Now Daniel told me to tell you

1337
01:00:18,450 --> 01:00:20,250
that he was needed on the set, right,

1338
01:00:20,250 --> 01:00:21,570
and he was gonna page you later,

1339
01:00:21,570 --> 01:00:23,860
if you can handle that
through all that anger.

1340
01:00:23,860 --> 01:00:24,693
- Yeah?

1341
01:00:24,693 --> 01:00:26,130
Well you can tell your cook that I told

1342
01:00:26,130 --> 01:00:27,870
his little hamburger helper that he could

1343
01:00:27,870 --> 01:00:30,120
fucking shove his big
head up his fucking ass

1344
01:00:30,120 --> 01:00:33,328
and go join the rest of you
brown nosed Hollywood fucks!

1345
01:00:33,328 --> 01:00:34,760
Mm.

1346
01:00:34,760 --> 01:00:36,283
Two words: decaf.

1347
01:00:38,449 --> 01:00:39,407
- Hey, you okay?

1348
01:00:39,407 --> 01:00:41,978
- Hey man, I'm not into
that shit, all right?

1349
01:00:41,978 --> 01:00:42,811
- Okay.

1350
01:00:42,811 --> 01:00:44,460
How about a beer?

1351
01:00:44,460 --> 01:00:46,090
- Are you buyin'?

1352
01:00:46,090 --> 01:00:46,923
- Okay.

1353
01:00:46,923 --> 01:00:48,400
- All right.
- I'll buy.

1354
01:00:48,400 --> 01:00:50,066
Hey, man.

1355
01:00:50,066 --> 01:00:51,280
- This motherfucker gives me a goddamn

1356
01:00:51,280 --> 01:00:53,950
pain on my fuckin' dick,
and who the fuck is Bobo?

1357
01:00:53,950 --> 01:00:55,523
Bobo my motherfuckin' nuts!

1358
01:01:00,430 --> 01:01:01,993
Hey man, turn that shit off.

1359
01:01:02,923 --> 01:01:04,790
I mean, what do they see in him?

1360
01:01:04,790 --> 01:01:06,280
Women, right?

1361
01:01:06,280 --> 01:01:08,253
They blubber about honesty, caring,

1362
01:01:09,130 --> 01:01:10,380
and all that crap, right?

1363
01:01:10,380 --> 01:01:11,324
Right?

1364
01:01:11,324 --> 01:01:13,924
And then they get mushy
over the Ginzo knife master.

1365
01:01:14,840 --> 01:01:16,290
- What?

1366
01:01:16,290 --> 01:01:18,010
I think you lost me a little bit there.

1367
01:01:18,010 --> 01:01:20,220
- Pretend this is Samantha.

1368
01:01:20,220 --> 01:01:21,053
Still with me?

1369
01:01:23,580 --> 01:01:26,830
Daniel, the Ginzo knife, fuckin' slices

1370
01:01:26,830 --> 01:01:29,200
and then fuckin' dices and then...

1371
01:01:29,200 --> 01:01:31,810
Shabam. Out of fuckin' sight
and outta fuckin' mind.

1372
01:01:31,810 --> 01:01:33,770
But wait, 'cause there's more.

1373
01:01:33,770 --> 01:01:36,690
'Cause if you fuckin' fall
for his line of bullshit now,

1374
01:01:36,690 --> 01:01:40,060
we'll throw of paring knives
abso-fucking-lutely free.

1375
01:01:40,060 --> 01:01:41,520
And you can learn to carve cute

1376
01:01:41,520 --> 01:01:44,070
and unusual shapes out of
your best friend's heart.

1377
01:01:47,060 --> 01:01:50,270
- Well at least Sam seems
to be dealing with it okay.

1378
01:01:50,270 --> 01:01:51,920
- Yeah, women.

1379
01:01:51,920 --> 01:01:52,803
Exactly.

1380
01:01:54,270 --> 01:01:55,420
Man, go fuckin' figure.

1381
01:02:00,980 --> 01:02:03,267
- What?

1382
01:02:03,267 --> 01:02:04,100
What?

1383
01:02:06,180 --> 01:02:08,130
You think it's different for me, right?

1384
01:02:08,130 --> 01:02:10,210
- Well obviously you're confused as shit.

1385
01:02:10,210 --> 01:02:12,160
What the hell, what the fuck do I know?

1386
01:02:13,875 --> 01:02:15,300
- Well you know how you feel.

1387
01:02:15,300 --> 01:02:16,713
- Yeah, fuckin' too late.

1388
01:02:17,877 --> 01:02:19,321
- Yeah, with Nicole probably.

1389
01:02:20,590 --> 01:02:21,423
- Thanks man.

1390
01:02:22,540 --> 01:02:24,100
Yeah, I know.

1391
01:02:24,100 --> 01:02:25,453
I fucked it all up.

1392
01:02:26,470 --> 01:02:28,523
- At our darkest hour, we see the light.

1393
01:02:30,490 --> 01:02:32,523
- Give me a break, Walking Bear.

1394
01:02:34,770 --> 01:02:37,748
- My Native American name
is Two Moons Over Miami.

1395
01:02:39,220 --> 01:02:42,270
Get the fuck out.

1396
01:02:42,270 --> 01:02:44,390
- Eh, my parents were hippies.

1397
01:02:44,390 --> 01:02:46,137
- I should say so.

1398
01:02:46,137 --> 01:02:47,307
What the fuck were the smoking, man?

1399
01:02:47,307 --> 01:02:50,160
Can you hook that shit up
on the reservation or what?

1400
01:02:50,160 --> 01:02:53,900
- You see, I haven't even
spoken to him in over a year,

1401
01:02:53,900 --> 01:02:56,880
but I still feel like we're
connected in some way.

1402
01:02:56,880 --> 01:02:58,460
You know, like a soulmate?

1403
01:02:58,460 --> 01:03:01,253
- It's important that you
baste the bird regularly.

1404
01:03:02,279 --> 01:03:04,800
If you don't, the gaminess will dry out

1405
01:03:04,800 --> 01:03:06,620
and taste like middle-aged turkey.

1406
01:03:06,620 --> 01:03:09,090
- You mean that I should call him?

1407
01:03:09,090 --> 01:03:09,923
- Baste the bird.

1408
01:03:09,923 --> 01:03:12,250
And that he
still thinks about me?

1409
01:03:12,250 --> 01:03:13,940
- Baste the damn bird!

1410
01:03:13,940 --> 01:03:14,773
- Can the call.

1411
01:03:14,773 --> 01:03:16,520
- Well we have.
- She's a nutcase!

1412
01:03:16,520 --> 01:03:17,840
- Calls constantly.

1413
01:03:17,840 --> 01:03:20,390
Every time giving me a new name.

1414
01:03:20,390 --> 01:03:21,800
- Oh, I get it now.

1415
01:03:21,800 --> 01:03:24,626
- Could you signal Daniel
to end this call now?

1416
01:03:24,626 --> 01:03:25,890
Everything will come together.

1417
01:03:25,890 --> 01:03:28,460
I must think positively.

1418
01:03:28,460 --> 01:03:30,718
- Game hens do not think!

1419
01:03:30,718 --> 01:03:32,147
They comes without the head!

1420
01:03:32,147 --> 01:03:33,540
There, done!

1421
01:03:33,540 --> 01:03:37,939
He stabbed the goddamn bird.

1422
01:03:42,070 --> 01:03:45,010
- And there are several
other cooking shows on TV.

1423
01:03:45,010 --> 01:03:46,640
Do you want to tell me why you think

1424
01:03:46,640 --> 01:03:49,230
yours has become a nationwide sensation?

1425
01:03:49,230 --> 01:03:50,360
- I don't know.

1426
01:03:50,360 --> 01:03:52,030
I'm not a sex therapist.

1427
01:03:52,030 --> 01:03:54,000
I'm not Dr. Love.
- Oh yes you are.

1428
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:55,400
For these women, you are.

1429
01:03:55,400 --> 01:03:56,780
- I can't do it anymore.

1430
01:03:56,780 --> 01:03:58,900
- Well, I think you're overreacting.

1431
01:03:58,900 --> 01:04:00,660
We'll take care of tonight's caller.

1432
01:04:00,660 --> 01:04:02,963
From now on-
- I don't wanna do it anymore.

1433
01:04:07,320 --> 01:04:09,900
- Now you listen here.

1434
01:04:09,900 --> 01:04:12,270
You're not in the back of some small time

1435
01:04:12,270 --> 01:04:14,260
kitchen appliance store now.

1436
01:04:14,260 --> 01:04:17,400
You are under contract to a very large

1437
01:04:17,400 --> 01:04:18,880
television corporation that doesn't

1438
01:04:18,880 --> 01:04:20,403
give a damn what you want.

1439
01:04:25,308 --> 01:04:27,641
Now, you drive yourself home

1440
01:04:31,050 --> 01:04:34,993
in your brand new Range
Rover and cool off.

1441
01:04:40,140 --> 01:04:40,973
Now then.

1442
01:04:42,350 --> 01:04:43,900
I'll see you tomorrow, sweetie.

1443
01:04:47,060 --> 01:04:50,593
Oh, and don't forget to
make those cookies for me.

1444
01:04:52,104 --> 01:04:52,937
- Oh but dude, seriously.

1445
01:04:52,937 --> 01:04:54,410
Did you buy that Indian
motherfucker, dude?

1446
01:04:54,410 --> 01:04:56,300
That Indian bitch that had the real...

1447
01:04:56,300 --> 01:04:57,727
Oh that motherfucker was tripping, dude.

1448
01:04:57,727 --> 01:04:59,195
I, uh, fuck it.

1449
01:04:59,195 --> 01:05:00,385
Oh man.

1450
01:05:01,722 --> 01:05:03,750
Hey.
- Oh shit, did you see that?

1451
01:05:03,750 --> 01:05:06,157
- Wow, fuck dude. Yeah.

1452
01:05:08,870 --> 01:05:09,703
How y'all doin'?

1453
01:05:09,703 --> 01:05:12,080
- And are you gonna be in any
condition tomorrow morning

1454
01:05:12,080 --> 01:05:15,593
at eight o'clock to sign
perhaps over a thousand books?

1455
01:05:16,600 --> 01:05:17,720
- I'm not going.

1456
01:05:17,720 --> 01:05:19,794
- You have a responsibility to be there.

1457
01:05:20,627 --> 01:05:21,670
- It's not even my cookbook.

1458
01:05:21,670 --> 01:05:23,310
- Uh...

1459
01:05:23,310 --> 01:05:26,190
It's got your name on it and your picture.

1460
01:05:26,190 --> 01:05:28,123
- Yeah. I'm a fuckin' logo.

1461
01:05:29,140 --> 01:05:34,036
- There are a lot of your recipes in here.

1462
01:05:34,036 --> 01:05:34,869
- Oh?

1463
01:05:35,980 --> 01:05:38,040
You're right. Look at that.

1464
01:05:38,040 --> 01:05:39,523
Turkey tetrazzini.

1465
01:05:41,140 --> 01:05:42,453
I hate turkey tetrazzini.

1466
01:05:43,460 --> 01:05:46,263
- Okay, you can write every
chapter of the next book.

1467
01:05:48,170 --> 01:05:50,130
What's the matter with you?

1468
01:05:50,130 --> 01:05:51,940
- What's the matter with me?

1469
01:05:51,940 --> 01:05:53,850
I'm the matter with me.

1470
01:05:53,850 --> 01:05:54,683
Look at me.

1471
01:05:57,040 --> 01:05:58,193
- I am looking at you.

1472
01:05:59,620 --> 01:06:00,710
- No.

1473
01:06:00,710 --> 01:06:02,433
Just look at me.

1474
01:06:03,960 --> 01:06:05,343
- I am looking at you.

1475
01:06:06,360 --> 01:06:09,649
- I haven't cooked for
anyone in over six months.

1476
01:06:09,649 --> 01:06:11,670
- Well I'm sorry, Danny.

1477
01:06:11,670 --> 01:06:13,450
Well, if that's what's bothering you,

1478
01:06:13,450 --> 01:06:14,700
we'll stay home tomorrow night,

1479
01:06:14,700 --> 01:06:17,933
you'll cook, we'll
celebrate the book signing.

1480
01:06:22,608 --> 01:06:23,508
I love you, Danny.

1481
01:06:24,450 --> 01:06:25,330
- I don't...

1482
01:06:26,810 --> 01:06:27,643
Love me.

1483
01:06:39,550 --> 01:06:41,450
- You paid the bill. Thank you.

1484
01:06:42,540 --> 01:06:43,373
How long?

1485
01:06:45,150 --> 01:06:46,883
Okay. Just tell him to honk.

1486
01:06:47,850 --> 01:06:49,173
Yeah, it's a loft.

1487
01:06:50,390 --> 01:06:51,223
Thank you.

1488
01:06:53,149 --> 01:06:54,310
- Where are you off to?

1489
01:06:54,310 --> 01:06:55,533
- San Francisco.

1490
01:06:57,220 --> 01:06:58,910
A friend is sick.

1491
01:06:58,910 --> 01:06:59,743
I gotta go.

1492
01:07:00,627 --> 01:07:01,460
- Are you okay?

1493
01:07:07,370 --> 01:07:09,433
Let me help you with that.
- Thanks.

1494
01:07:12,611 --> 01:07:13,500
Oh.

1495
01:07:13,500 --> 01:07:16,600
Your friends um, they like my work.

1496
01:07:16,600 --> 01:07:18,370
- Oh yeah?
- They wanna show it.

1497
01:07:18,370 --> 01:07:19,520
That's great.

1498
01:07:25,430 --> 01:07:26,333
Thank you.

1499
01:07:27,710 --> 01:07:28,543
- Name?

1500
01:07:28,543 --> 01:07:30,250
- Oh, it's for my wife, Gloria.

1501
01:07:30,250 --> 01:07:33,187
- To Gloria. Love from
the kitchen, Daniel.

1502
01:07:33,187 --> 01:07:34,775
Thanks.

1503
01:07:34,775 --> 01:07:36,020
- Can I get you anything?

1504
01:07:36,020 --> 01:07:36,987
- You can get me out of here.

1505
01:07:36,987 --> 01:07:38,237
- Oh, you're doing great.

1506
01:07:39,530 --> 01:07:40,363
Name?

1507
01:07:40,363 --> 01:07:41,196
- Sam.

1508
01:07:42,830 --> 01:07:45,110
I really love your show.

1509
01:07:45,110 --> 01:07:46,373
- Thanks, Sam.

1510
01:07:47,630 --> 01:07:51,050
- It's amazing the way you
care so much about the people.

1511
01:07:51,050 --> 01:07:53,530
You're so real, so honest.

1512
01:07:53,530 --> 01:07:54,363
- Thank you.

1513
01:07:54,363 --> 01:07:55,196
Do I know you?

1514
01:07:55,196 --> 01:07:57,000
- I'm Cynthia. We talk a lot.

1515
01:07:57,000 --> 01:08:00,130
The other night on the phone-
- To Cynthia.

1516
01:08:00,130 --> 01:08:02,130
You'll love the turkey tetrazzini.

1517
01:08:02,130 --> 01:08:04,573
It's really you.
- Thanks.

1518
01:08:06,640 --> 01:08:07,678
- Name?

1519
01:08:07,678 --> 01:08:08,650
Shithead.

1520
01:08:08,650 --> 01:08:09,880
- Peter.

1521
01:08:09,880 --> 01:08:11,397
- It's a birthday present for Sam.

1522
01:08:11,397 --> 01:08:13,403
Oh, you do remember Sam, now don't ya?

1523
01:08:14,250 --> 01:08:15,560
- Is this about me not calling her back?

1524
01:08:15,560 --> 01:08:17,585
- No, this is about Sam.

1525
01:08:17,585 --> 01:08:18,660
- What about Sam?

1526
01:08:18,660 --> 01:08:19,740
- Dude, cut the crap.

1527
01:08:19,740 --> 01:08:21,350
You cannot be that blind.

1528
01:08:21,350 --> 01:08:23,440
- Daniel, there are a
lot of people waiting.

1529
01:08:23,440 --> 01:08:24,440
- One sec.

1530
01:08:24,440 --> 01:08:25,830
What about Sam?

1531
01:08:25,830 --> 01:08:28,059
- All I'm saying is
don't be stupid like me.

1532
01:08:28,059 --> 01:08:29,649
- Maybe we could have
this discussion later.

1533
01:08:29,649 --> 01:08:31,780
- One second. What's going on with Sam?

1534
01:08:31,780 --> 01:08:33,620
- You're supposed to
be the expert of love.

1535
01:08:33,620 --> 01:08:34,743
- Daniel, please.

1536
01:08:37,270 --> 01:08:38,103
- So?

1537
01:08:39,342 --> 01:08:40,175
Oh, forget it.

1538
01:08:43,120 --> 01:08:45,145
- Hey, watch it, asshole.

1539
01:08:56,500 --> 01:08:57,333
- I'll get it.

1540
01:09:01,569 --> 01:09:02,469
Hello?

1541
01:09:02,469 --> 01:09:03,969
- Hi. This is Sam.

1542
01:09:03,969 --> 01:09:05,853
Uh, can I speak to Daniel please?

1543
01:09:06,920 --> 01:09:08,130
- Um, Daniel's not here right now.

1544
01:09:08,130 --> 01:09:09,350
Can I take a message?

1545
01:09:09,350 --> 01:09:12,370
- Yeah. It's regarding his father.

1546
01:09:12,370 --> 01:09:15,479
I'm in San Francisco at
St. Francis Medical Center.

1547
01:09:15,479 --> 01:09:17,559
He should get here as soon as possible.

1548
01:09:17,559 --> 01:09:19,197
- I know what you're trying to do, Sam.

1549
01:09:19,197 --> 01:09:20,670
- And what would that be?

1550
01:09:20,670 --> 01:09:22,760
- Do you really think it's appropriate?

1551
01:09:22,760 --> 01:09:24,910
Using his father to get close to him?

1552
01:09:24,910 --> 01:09:26,350
- If you give a shit about him at all,

1553
01:09:26,350 --> 01:09:28,153
I suggest you get him up here.

1554
01:09:30,380 --> 01:09:31,653
- Thanks for the advice.

1555
01:09:47,612 --> 01:09:48,444
- Right.

1556
01:09:51,260 --> 01:09:53,103
Of course I'll handle it

1557
01:09:54,370 --> 01:09:55,223
Don't worry.

1558
01:09:56,320 --> 01:09:57,573
Nighty-night.

1559
01:10:02,719 --> 01:10:04,163
What a doll to call.

1560
01:10:13,840 --> 01:10:14,673
Oh, god.

1561
01:10:17,844 --> 01:10:19,210
- Mmm.

1562
01:10:19,210 --> 01:10:20,460
It smells good.

1563
01:10:23,639 --> 01:10:24,473
- Who called?

1564
01:10:25,620 --> 01:10:27,559
- Um, nothing special.

1565
01:10:27,559 --> 01:10:31,353
Just Kathryn blubbering
about the Valentine's show.

1566
01:10:32,350 --> 01:10:34,420
- Oh, Valentine's. I almost forgot.

1567
01:10:34,420 --> 01:10:35,727
Sam, I should call her.

1568
01:10:35,727 --> 01:10:37,290
- Um, she's out of town.

1569
01:10:37,290 --> 01:10:38,910
Left a message yesterday.

1570
01:10:38,910 --> 01:10:39,743
- Where is she?

1571
01:10:40,870 --> 01:10:41,743
- San Francisco.

1572
01:10:42,870 --> 01:10:44,680
You know Peter had no right

1573
01:10:44,680 --> 01:10:45,990
to betray her feelings like that.

1574
01:10:45,990 --> 01:10:47,980
I was so embarrassed for her.

1575
01:10:47,980 --> 01:10:49,773
- Peter is just upset over Nicole,

1576
01:10:50,639 --> 01:10:54,253
and Sam's feelings are
nobody's business, okay?

1577
01:10:57,380 --> 01:10:59,090
- This looks fabulous.

1578
01:10:59,090 --> 01:10:59,923
I'm starving.

1579
01:11:32,531 --> 01:11:33,436
- Right there?

1580
01:11:33,436 --> 01:11:34,519
- Right here.

1581
01:11:36,325 --> 01:11:37,157
- Mmm.

1582
01:11:38,371 --> 01:11:39,903
Looks really good.

1583
01:11:39,903 --> 01:11:41,525
It's really, really sexy.

1584
01:11:41,525 --> 01:11:42,456
- Sexy?

1585
01:11:42,456 --> 01:11:43,289
- Oh, god.

1586
01:11:45,179 --> 01:11:46,650
You're gonna knock 'em dead.

1587
01:11:46,650 --> 01:11:47,483
- Woo.

1588
01:11:50,219 --> 01:11:52,423
Hey.

1589
01:11:55,350 --> 01:11:56,183
- I'm smitten.

1590
01:11:57,850 --> 01:11:59,280
Marry me.

1591
01:11:59,280 --> 01:12:00,983
- Come on, quit kidding around.

1592
01:12:05,010 --> 01:12:05,910
- Marry me, Danny.

1593
01:12:11,670 --> 01:12:12,503
- Wow.

1594
01:12:16,480 --> 01:12:17,743
I don't know what to say.

1595
01:12:21,602 --> 01:12:23,269
- Say yes.

1596
01:12:28,258 --> 01:12:29,235
- Yes?

1597
01:12:29,235 --> 01:12:33,068
- On stage, Danny.
Kathryn's screamin'.

1598
01:12:34,227 --> 01:12:35,059
- Say it.

1599
01:12:38,368 --> 01:12:39,618
- They need me.

1600
01:12:41,057 --> 01:12:42,670
- Say yes.

1601
01:12:42,670 --> 01:12:43,930
Come on, Danny.

1602
01:12:43,930 --> 01:12:46,150
We're behind schedule.

1603
01:12:46,150 --> 01:12:47,223
- I, I gotta go.

1604
01:12:55,091 --> 01:13:00,091
This is not the right time.

1605
01:13:20,084 --> 01:13:21,501
- Hi sleepy head.

1606
01:13:22,378 --> 01:13:24,378
- No. Go home, Samantha.

1607
01:13:26,494 --> 01:13:28,487
- I wanna stay.

1608
01:13:28,487 --> 01:13:30,155
- Oh, no sweetheart.

1609
01:13:31,608 --> 01:13:33,525
I'm so proud of Daniel.

1610
01:13:35,463 --> 01:13:36,630
You know he...

1611
01:13:38,262 --> 01:13:40,179
He's found himself, eh?

1612
01:13:41,596 --> 01:13:45,963
You understood and you helped him.

1613
01:13:49,193 --> 01:13:52,026
You know what I always wanted, eh?

1614
01:13:55,001 --> 01:13:56,251
You and Daniel.

1615
01:13:58,082 --> 01:13:59,478
Eh.

1616
01:13:59,478 --> 01:14:00,312
- I know.

1617
01:14:01,639 --> 01:14:03,773
- Turn it on on the television.

1618
01:14:06,680 --> 01:14:09,490
- We all put our trust in this

1619
01:14:09,490 --> 01:14:11,400
heart-shaped box of chocolates.

1620
01:14:11,400 --> 01:14:12,990
But if you're cooking with me,

1621
01:14:12,990 --> 01:14:15,500
let's stir our valentine to bubble

1622
01:14:15,500 --> 01:14:17,950
and overflow with desire.

1623
01:14:17,950 --> 01:14:22,639
- And I'm here in some small
way to act as your Cupid.

1624
01:14:22,639 --> 01:14:23,473
- Oh, brother.

1625
01:14:23,473 --> 01:14:25,680
- In two hours, we'll serve a meal

1626
01:14:25,680 --> 01:14:29,260
filled with the ingredients
from our dictionary of love.

1627
01:14:29,260 --> 01:14:34,090
We'll simmer and season
with the herbs and spices

1628
01:14:34,090 --> 01:14:37,180
from my encyclopedia of aphrodisiac.

1629
01:14:37,180 --> 01:14:41,770
All my recipes guarantee
that their potency

1630
01:14:41,770 --> 01:14:43,639
will soon take it back.

1631
01:14:43,639 --> 01:14:46,370
This is not a show for the weak of hearts.

1632
01:14:46,370 --> 01:14:48,343
But before we get started,

1633
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:52,030
I would like to tell you all something

1634
01:14:52,030 --> 01:14:54,460
about somebody that is very special to me,

1635
01:14:54,460 --> 01:14:58,377
and Valentine's Day
always reminds me of her.

1636
01:15:00,270 --> 01:15:03,160
If you're watching,
Sam, wherever you are...

1637
01:15:03,160 --> 01:15:04,490
- Kathryn.

1638
01:15:04,490 --> 01:15:08,976
- I'm sending you a big,
nationwide happy birthday.

1639
01:15:08,976 --> 01:15:10,947
- He remembered.

1640
01:15:10,947 --> 01:15:12,253
- He has no idea.

1641
01:15:25,041 --> 01:15:26,291
Oh, please God.

1642
01:15:28,380 --> 01:15:30,263
Now how about some calls?

1643
01:15:32,510 --> 01:15:33,580
Cooking For Two.

1644
01:15:33,580 --> 01:15:36,406
Hi. When are you coming over?

1645
01:15:36,406 --> 01:15:38,073
- Oh. No valentine?

1646
01:15:38,996 --> 01:15:41,333
You don't recognize my voice?

1647
01:15:41,333 --> 01:15:42,166
- Not yet.

1648
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:45,590
- Daniel. I'm disappointed in you.

1649
01:15:45,590 --> 01:15:46,943
It's Nicole.

1650
01:15:48,030 --> 01:15:49,559
Peter's Nicole?

1651
01:15:49,559 --> 01:15:52,270
I'm not Peter's anything.

1652
01:15:52,270 --> 01:15:54,833
- So you're calling for love advice?

1653
01:15:55,990 --> 01:15:58,683
- Yes I am, as a matter of fact.

1654
01:15:59,590 --> 01:16:02,870
I was wondering, Daniel,
if you could tell me

1655
01:16:02,870 --> 01:16:04,930
how to get a date.

1656
01:16:04,930 --> 01:16:06,779
- Have you tried asking?

1657
01:16:09,423 --> 01:16:10,800
- How simple.

1658
01:16:10,800 --> 01:16:14,920
Daniel, would you like to
go out on a date with me?

1659
01:16:14,920 --> 01:16:16,639
You've tried everybody else.

1660
01:16:16,639 --> 01:16:18,900
- Oh, fuck me!

1661
01:16:18,900 --> 01:16:20,660
- Looks like you're doing
a good job yourself.

1662
01:16:20,660 --> 01:16:22,120
- Oh, what am I? Dog shit?

1663
01:16:22,120 --> 01:16:24,115
I mean, she's coming on to him.

1664
01:16:24,115 --> 01:16:25,134
- Not to me.

1665
01:16:25,134 --> 01:16:27,219
Shut up, Two Moons.

1666
01:16:27,219 --> 01:16:29,020
- I'm flattered, Nicole.

1667
01:16:29,020 --> 01:16:31,540
But um, Peter is my friend.

1668
01:16:31,540 --> 01:16:32,707
- You're not.

1669
01:16:35,954 --> 01:16:37,504
This is gonna be one good show.

1670
01:16:38,809 --> 01:16:39,643
- Daniel?

1671
01:16:42,596 --> 01:16:43,809
I really miss Peter.

1672
01:16:43,809 --> 01:16:44,936
- Conference call?

1673
01:16:44,936 --> 01:16:45,769
I gotta bring in the line.

1674
01:16:45,769 --> 01:16:46,670
- No, I understand how you feel,

1675
01:16:46,670 --> 01:16:49,179
but this is not Oprah.
- No, I'm not playin'!

1676
01:16:49,179 --> 01:16:51,457
- I know he's a jerk.

1677
01:16:51,457 --> 01:16:53,093
But I love him.

1678
01:16:53,093 --> 01:16:53,925
- Mm.

1679
01:16:56,090 --> 01:16:57,290
- I got it.

1680
01:16:57,290 --> 01:16:58,123
Toodles! I'm out, man.

1681
01:16:58,123 --> 01:17:00,400
- Call Peter, not me.
- Yeah, woo!

1682
01:17:03,153 --> 01:17:05,550
- Well I think uh, we gotta let this

1683
01:17:05,550 --> 01:17:10,550
cool off a second, so, let's
get the uh, cookie cutter out.

1684
01:17:11,969 --> 01:17:15,170
We're gonna use it to form
the phyllo dough into hearts.

1685
01:17:15,170 --> 01:17:16,430
- Wait, wait, wait, wait.

1686
01:17:16,430 --> 01:17:17,450
Don't put me on hold.

1687
01:17:17,450 --> 01:17:18,590
I'm the birthday girl.

1688
01:17:18,590 --> 01:17:19,510
I'm Sam.

1689
01:17:19,510 --> 01:17:20,620
- Calm down.

1690
01:17:20,620 --> 01:17:22,870
Calm down. I'm putting
you through right now.

1691
01:17:26,430 --> 01:17:27,680
- Cooking for Two.

1692
01:17:27,680 --> 01:17:29,100
- Daniel, it's Sam.

1693
01:17:29,100 --> 01:17:31,680
- Ladies and gentlemen, the birthday girl.

1694
01:17:31,680 --> 01:17:33,564
Perfect timing, Sam.

1695
01:17:33,564 --> 01:17:35,120
I, I have to tell you something.

1696
01:17:35,120 --> 01:17:36,280
- Speak up, Sam.

1697
01:17:36,280 --> 01:17:38,520
I can barely hear you.
- Let's break, goddammit.

1698
01:17:38,520 --> 01:17:39,469
45 seconds.

1699
01:17:41,790 --> 01:17:43,230
- We're cooked.
- What's wrong?

1700
01:17:43,230 --> 01:17:44,090
- Sam?

1701
01:17:44,090 --> 01:17:45,520
- Your father's in the hospital.

1702
01:17:45,520 --> 01:17:47,263
Didn't your sweetheart tell you?

1703
01:17:48,239 --> 01:17:50,030
- You didn't tell him.

1704
01:17:50,030 --> 01:17:52,487
- You told me to handle it, my dear.

1705
01:17:52,487 --> 01:17:53,460
What's happened?

1706
01:17:53,460 --> 01:17:54,840
- You witch.

1707
01:17:54,840 --> 01:17:57,960
- Don't you forget, you're
the Sorcerer's apprentice.

1708
01:17:57,960 --> 01:17:59,850
- I've been calling you for two days

1709
01:17:59,850 --> 01:18:01,643
and leaving you messages.

1710
01:18:01,643 --> 01:18:02,476
- What?

1711
01:18:02,476 --> 01:18:03,647
He had a heart attack.

1712
01:18:04,681 --> 01:18:05,980
- Where are you Sam?

1713
01:18:05,980 --> 01:18:09,020
- I'm in San Francisco
at St. Francis Memorial.

1714
01:18:09,020 --> 01:18:10,960
You gotta get here.

1715
01:18:10,960 --> 01:18:11,990
- No, don't stop.
- We'll be right back

1716
01:18:11,990 --> 01:18:14,059
with our Valentine's Day special

1717
01:18:14,059 --> 01:18:15,860
after a few words from our sponsors.

1718
01:18:16,800 --> 01:18:17,700
- I'm leaving now.

1719
01:18:19,404 --> 01:18:20,237
Ah!

1720
01:18:20,237 --> 01:18:21,070
- Too late.

1721
01:18:21,070 --> 01:18:22,860
Okay, hold your
marks, everybody. Stand by.

1722
01:18:22,860 --> 01:18:24,780
- Danny, I was going to tell you.

1723
01:18:24,780 --> 01:18:28,350
I thought Kathryn said she would.

1724
01:18:28,350 --> 01:18:30,650
- For two days, Jacqueline.

1725
01:18:30,650 --> 01:18:32,290
- Daniel, let's get back on our mark.

1726
01:18:32,290 --> 01:18:33,370
- Let's fuck off!

1727
01:18:33,370 --> 01:18:36,469
- Oh, Daniel, we're shattered by the news.

1728
01:18:36,469 --> 01:18:37,303
- Kathryn.

1729
01:18:39,190 --> 01:18:40,532
- You don't think I knew?

1730
01:18:41,760 --> 01:18:44,360
Oh, Daniel. I'm arranging everything.

1731
01:18:44,360 --> 01:18:45,610
We're in the middle of the show.

1732
01:18:45,610 --> 01:18:47,563
You can't walk now.

1733
01:18:48,940 --> 01:18:50,090
- You need a lift?

1734
01:18:50,090 --> 01:18:51,700
- Daniel.
- Yeah, let's go.

1735
01:18:51,700 --> 01:18:54,559
- Danny.
- Daniel, you can't do this.

1736
01:18:54,559 --> 01:18:56,458
You're blowing a whole year's worth...

1737
01:18:56,458 --> 01:18:58,197
Goddammit, you're blowing the ratings!

1738
01:18:58,197 --> 01:19:01,055
You're blowing our jobs!

1739
01:19:01,055 --> 01:19:02,509
- Kathryn.

1740
01:19:02,509 --> 01:19:04,231
Enough.

1741
01:19:04,231 --> 01:19:05,064
- Oh.

1742
01:19:13,862 --> 01:19:14,695
- Excuse me.

1743
01:19:14,695 --> 01:19:16,490
Do you know where Mr. Haus's room is?

1744
01:19:16,490 --> 01:19:18,000
- Are you his next of kin?

1745
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:20,090
- I'm Daniel Haus, his son.

1746
01:19:20,090 --> 01:19:21,469
- The cook?

1747
01:19:21,469 --> 01:19:22,447
Oh.

1748
01:19:22,447 --> 01:19:24,730
Um, will you wait over here, Mr. Haus?

1749
01:19:24,730 --> 01:19:25,920
I'll go get the doctor.

1750
01:19:25,920 --> 01:19:27,389
- Thank you.

1751
01:19:27,389 --> 01:19:28,223
Sam.

1752
01:19:39,212 --> 01:19:40,045
Sam.

1753
01:19:41,487 --> 01:19:43,360
Sam, I can't see him by myself.

1754
01:19:43,360 --> 01:19:44,800
Please don't go, Sam.

1755
01:19:44,800 --> 01:19:45,830
I need you now.

1756
01:19:52,589 --> 01:19:53,922
How's my father?

1757
01:19:56,663 --> 01:19:59,080
He didn't make it.

1758
01:20:15,385 --> 01:20:17,635
- I saw you at the funeral.

1759
01:20:19,079 --> 01:20:19,912
Thank you.

1760
01:20:26,590 --> 01:20:27,540
I'm sorry, Sam.

1761
01:20:30,352 --> 01:20:32,518
I never meant to hurt you.

1762
01:20:32,518 --> 01:20:34,450
And now I have.

1763
01:20:34,450 --> 01:20:35,483
- You lied to me.

1764
01:20:36,480 --> 01:20:38,903
You said you wouldn't change, remember?

1765
01:20:40,219 --> 01:20:42,173
You said you wouldn't get fat headed.

1766
01:20:44,567 --> 01:20:45,400
- I know.

1767
01:20:46,508 --> 01:20:47,341
I'm sorry.

1768
01:20:49,950 --> 01:20:51,150
- You already said that.

1769
01:20:53,246 --> 01:20:54,847
- I don't know what to say then.

1770
01:20:57,250 --> 01:20:59,210
- I find that incredible
coming from someone

1771
01:20:59,210 --> 01:21:00,450
who makes a shitload of money

1772
01:21:00,450 --> 01:21:01,969
saying the right thing to women.

1773
01:21:01,969 --> 01:21:03,139
- Sam, I...

1774
01:21:03,139 --> 01:21:04,350
You mean a lot to me, okay?

1775
01:21:04,350 --> 01:21:06,027
I know it doesn't seem that way,

1776
01:21:06,027 --> 01:21:08,163
but I never meant to lose what we had.

1777
01:21:10,630 --> 01:21:11,809
- What we had?

1778
01:21:11,809 --> 01:21:13,850
That's great.

1779
01:21:13,850 --> 01:21:15,130
- I wanna go back.

1780
01:21:15,130 --> 01:21:16,393
- I can't go back.

1781
01:21:18,370 --> 01:21:19,520
Everything's different.

1782
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:22,193
You've changed.

1783
01:21:25,320 --> 01:21:27,183
I've changed.

1784
01:21:27,183 --> 01:21:28,100
- Oh, Sam.

1785
01:21:29,932 --> 01:21:31,832
I don't know where I'd be without you.

1786
01:21:36,925 --> 01:21:38,170
- What are you doing?

1787
01:21:38,170 --> 01:21:41,360
- I, I just, I just wanted to kiss you.

1788
01:21:41,360 --> 01:21:42,639
- So this is a joke?

1789
01:21:42,639 --> 01:21:44,490
- I, I, I thought...

1790
01:21:44,490 --> 01:21:46,610
Listen, I know how you feel about me, Sam.

1791
01:21:46,610 --> 01:21:47,680
- Oh thanks.

1792
01:21:47,680 --> 01:21:48,513
- No, it's okay.

1793
01:21:48,513 --> 01:21:50,960
I feel the same about you, too.

1794
01:21:50,960 --> 01:21:52,070
- That's perfect.

1795
01:21:52,070 --> 01:21:55,270
Of course, because it's always
about what you feel, right?

1796
01:21:55,270 --> 01:21:57,630
What does Daniel need?
What does Daniel want?

1797
01:21:57,630 --> 01:22:00,330
What are you feeling?
What can I do for you now?

1798
01:22:00,330 --> 01:22:02,770
- No, it's also what you need, Sam.

1799
01:22:02,770 --> 01:22:06,190
- You know what? You
have no idea what I need.

1800
01:22:06,190 --> 01:22:08,469
- I thought we need each
other, you know, it's-

1801
01:22:08,469 --> 01:22:10,023
- I'm sorry. You know what?

1802
01:22:10,023 --> 01:22:11,103
Just forget it.

1803
01:22:12,530 --> 01:22:13,670
It's too late.

1804
01:22:13,670 --> 01:22:14,503
- Sam?

1805
01:22:29,048 --> 01:22:29,940
- We're gonna be late.

1806
01:22:29,940 --> 01:22:31,370
- Hey, have you seen the latest one?

1807
01:22:31,370 --> 01:22:33,830
Now Daniel's, he's
having an affair with...

1808
01:22:43,330 --> 01:22:44,260
- Okay. That's enough.

1809
01:22:44,260 --> 01:22:46,860
You're making me nervous
looking at me like that.

1810
01:22:46,860 --> 01:22:48,593
- Baby you look...

1811
01:22:48,593 --> 01:22:49,514
- Thank you.

1812
01:22:49,514 --> 01:22:50,511
- Wow.

1813
01:22:50,511 --> 01:22:52,233
Goddamn, girl.

1814
01:22:56,070 --> 01:22:56,903
Nicole.

1815
01:23:01,740 --> 01:23:04,666
Have uh, you ever thought that um...

1816
01:23:06,599 --> 01:23:07,516
Me and you?

1817
01:23:11,946 --> 01:23:12,779
Yeah?

1818
01:23:14,139 --> 01:23:14,972
Yeah?

1819
01:23:22,751 --> 01:23:24,123
You know how much I love you?

1820
01:23:28,077 --> 01:23:30,010
- I love you.

1821
01:24:07,418 --> 01:24:08,840
I'm gonna go look around.

1822
01:24:08,840 --> 01:24:11,240
- Hey stranger.

1823
01:24:11,240 --> 01:24:12,532
How are you?

1824
01:24:13,982 --> 01:24:16,090
- Wow you look, you look beautiful.

1825
01:24:16,090 --> 01:24:17,740
- You speak the truth, my friend.

1826
01:24:19,549 --> 01:24:21,632
- Well, so, where is she?

1827
01:24:24,809 --> 01:24:26,330
- Hello.

1828
01:24:26,330 --> 01:24:28,130
Daniel, she's right in front of you.

1829
01:24:32,540 --> 01:24:33,874
Hi.

1830
01:24:33,874 --> 01:24:35,650
- Hi.

1831
01:24:35,650 --> 01:24:36,960
- Hi.

1832
01:24:36,960 --> 01:24:38,232
- Hey.

1833
01:24:40,090 --> 01:24:41,600
- You missed the spread,

1834
01:24:41,600 --> 01:24:45,270
but there's some peanuts left.

1835
01:24:45,270 --> 01:24:46,469
- Some peanuts, huh?

1836
01:24:47,559 --> 01:24:49,823
Well um, I've eaten.

1837
01:24:52,930 --> 01:24:54,030
- You're looking thin.

1838
01:24:57,431 --> 01:24:59,403
- Well, you're looking beautiful.

1839
01:25:02,230 --> 01:25:03,191
- Really?

1840
01:25:03,191 --> 01:25:04,490
- Mhm.

1841
01:25:04,490 --> 01:25:06,422
- Julie says I'm a late bloomer.

1842
01:25:09,210 --> 01:25:10,282
So what do you think?

1843
01:25:11,219 --> 01:25:12,053
- About what?

1844
01:25:13,940 --> 01:25:14,773
- About...

1845
01:25:14,773 --> 01:25:17,003
- Oh no, this is great.

1846
01:25:18,860 --> 01:25:22,223
I'm very proud of you, Sam,
and I'm very happy for you.

1847
01:25:23,910 --> 01:25:24,743
- Thanks.

1848
01:25:25,630 --> 01:25:26,653
That means a lot.

1849
01:25:28,931 --> 01:25:30,931
- So you're moving up in the world, huh?

1850
01:25:31,950 --> 01:25:32,782
- Yeah.

1851
01:25:33,940 --> 01:25:36,190
Huge changes.

1852
01:25:36,190 --> 01:25:38,993
Incredible stuff is happening.

1853
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:40,833
How about you?

1854
01:25:40,833 --> 01:25:43,873
Oh, small changes, you know.

1855
01:25:44,800 --> 01:25:47,483
Planning, plans sort of
stuff happening, too.

1856
01:25:48,990 --> 01:25:51,362
- Well, good to see you.

1857
01:25:52,389 --> 01:25:53,879
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1858
01:25:53,879 --> 01:25:55,429
Well it's good to see you, too.

1859
01:25:56,830 --> 01:25:58,160
Well.

1860
01:25:58,160 --> 01:25:59,090
- Well?

1861
01:25:59,090 --> 01:26:00,660
- Okay.

1862
01:26:00,660 --> 01:26:01,493
- Okay.

1863
01:26:02,480 --> 01:26:05,469
- I'm circulating, I-
- Oh yeah, of course.

1864
01:26:09,941 --> 01:26:12,941
Can I talk to you for a sec?

1865
01:26:52,636 --> 01:26:54,136
- What am I doing?

1866
01:27:03,119 --> 01:27:04,388
Sam.

1867
01:27:04,388 --> 01:27:05,221
- What are you doing?

1868
01:27:05,221 --> 01:27:06,360
- Please come with me.
I need to talk to you.

1869
01:27:06,360 --> 01:27:07,350
I need to show you something.

1870
01:27:07,350 --> 01:27:08,870
- Now? Leave my show?

1871
01:27:08,870 --> 01:27:10,160
- I can't wait.

1872
01:27:10,160 --> 01:27:10,993
- I can't leave.

1873
01:27:10,993 --> 01:27:11,853
- Please?

1874
01:27:49,913 --> 01:27:51,510
- Are you gonna tell me
what this is all about?

1875
01:27:51,510 --> 01:27:53,460
- Yes, I just wanna ask you a question.

1876
01:27:56,750 --> 01:27:57,853
- Why here?

1877
01:27:59,760 --> 01:28:01,510
- What do you think about my place?

1878
01:28:02,430 --> 01:28:03,570
- This is your place?

1879
01:28:04,480 --> 01:28:05,313
It's cute.

1880
01:28:05,313 --> 01:28:06,630
It's a California craftsman.

1881
01:28:08,760 --> 01:28:09,593
- So?

1882
01:28:11,040 --> 01:28:13,219
You think you could um...

1883
01:28:16,080 --> 01:28:16,913
Live in here?

1884
01:28:18,440 --> 01:28:19,460
- Is that what this is?

1885
01:28:19,460 --> 01:28:20,466
You need a roommate?

1886
01:28:20,466 --> 01:28:21,299
- No, Sam.
- 'Cause I already-

1887
01:28:21,299 --> 01:28:22,132
- Sam.

1888
01:28:22,996 --> 01:28:24,423
This is a one bedroom.

1889
01:29:20,037 --> 01:29:23,589
All right, Mikey, are you
ready for a little party?

1890
01:29:23,589 --> 01:29:25,557
