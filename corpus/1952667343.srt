1
00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:00,420
You move over.

2
00:01:00,550 --> 00:01:03,800
Hey, this is Luke. This is my film.
Let me ask you a couple of questions.

3
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:05,470
Why do you dance?

4
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:08,140
Because it's like breathing,
it's like walking to me.

5
00:01:08,260 --> 00:01:10,270
I'm not pretending.
When I dance I don't pretend.

6
00:01:10,390 --> 00:01:13,440
l'm more myself when l dance
than any other moment of the day.

7
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:16,690
I dance to become someone else.

8
00:01:16,810 --> 00:01:20,190
There are so many things in this world
that want to push down on you,

9
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:21,570
but when you dance you are free.

10
00:01:21,690 --> 00:01:26,160
We started dancing at the age of seven
in our house, in the living room.

11
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:29,160
Just dancing, dancing,
copying Michael Jackson.

12
00:01:29,290 --> 00:01:31,830
And I'm just like listening to the music
in the grocery store,

13
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:34,160
just like dancing through the aisles
and stuff like that,

14
00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:36,290
and she's like,
"Contain yourself, calm down."

15
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:39,130
And l'm like, "l can't stop,
I have to do it, I have to do it."

16
00:01:39,250 --> 00:01:43,630
After everybody went to sleep I would
open the garage and just practise.

17
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:47,510
That's pretty much when I knew
I loved it because I had never dedicated

18
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:49,810
so much time and effort
into something like that.

19
00:01:49,930 --> 00:01:52,430
It's not us just jumping around.
Dance has vocabulary.

20
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,020
- lnglewood.
- I'm from Argentina.

21
00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:55,230
I'm from northern Uganda.

22
00:01:55,350 --> 00:01:56,900
- Miami, Florida.
- Koreatown, Los Angeles.

23
00:01:57,020 --> 00:01:58,520
There's a lot of gangs and violence.

24
00:01:58,650 --> 00:01:59,980
I couldn't be stuck there all my life.

25
00:02:00,110 --> 00:02:00,940
My village was attacked.

26
00:02:01,070 --> 00:02:02,780
My parents didn't even want me
around any more.

27
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:04,240
She actually kicked me out of the house.

28
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:06,070
- l had to go.
- Dance saved me.

29
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,610
Dance definitely saved me.

30
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:09,990
lf it wasn't for dance,
I don't know what we'd be doing right now.

31
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:11,370
I didn't have anything,
I didn't have money.

32
00:02:11,490 --> 00:02:14,450
I was living with $1 5 a week
in New York City.

33
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:17,370
Dance brought us together too,
all around the world. We're here.

34
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:19,380
Truth is everybody is a dancer inside.

35
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:20,500
We all have a heartbeat.

36
00:02:20,630 --> 00:02:23,170
We all have a rhythm inside.
Boom-boom, boom-boom.

37
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:26,090
- What's that one thing you say?
- Yeah, what do you call us?

38
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:27,760
- (Luke) Born from a boombox?
- Yes.

39
00:02:27,890 --> 00:02:30,470
- Born from a boombox.
- That's pretty good.

40
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:31,680
Born from a boombox.

41
00:02:31,810 --> 00:02:34,430
(Luke) It sounds stupid,
but I do feeI Iike that.

42
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,100
And if we listen hard enough,

43
00:02:36,230 --> 00:02:39,600
we realise that maybe we're all
pIugged into the same song.

44
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:53,040
(♪ Dance music)

45
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:57,460
New York University freshmen,
welcome to Washington Square Park.

46
00:02:57,580 --> 00:03:01,670
It's the central hub of our urban campus,
and to the right...

47
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:09,760
Mom? Dad? You guys can really go.

48
00:03:09,890 --> 00:03:11,970
No! We're gonna take you
and Camille out for dinner.

49
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:13,640
We promised her parents we'd feed her.

50
00:03:13,770 --> 00:03:15,600
We're already paying for our meal plans.
It's all good.

51
00:03:15,730 --> 00:03:17,270
Yeah, we're fine, we really are, Mrs A.

52
00:03:17,390 --> 00:03:19,060
- We should go.
- All right. One last picture.

53
00:03:19,190 --> 00:03:20,400
OK. One last picture.

54
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:23,110
Get together, you're best friends,
you could drive a truck through you.

55
00:03:23,230 --> 00:03:25,980
- We're close.
- Get closer! Put your arm around her.

56
00:03:26,110 --> 00:03:27,530
- OK.
- Good boy.

57
00:03:27,650 --> 00:03:29,860
All right. Ready? Say, "Mom is pretty."

58
00:03:29,990 --> 00:03:31,820
- (Both) Mom is pretty.
- Thank you.

59
00:03:31,950 --> 00:03:33,490
(Laughs) Ready? And... Oop.

60
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:37,290
Oh. Look at this. Picture of a hat.
I got a hat with hair.

61
00:03:37,410 --> 00:03:41,540
lf my father could see me now saying
goodbye to my son, a future engineer...

62
00:03:41,670 --> 00:03:44,420
l'm just so happy you're done
with that dance business, I can't tell you.

63
00:03:44,550 --> 00:03:45,710
Oh, but you have...

64
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:48,840
- OK, all right. You make me proud.
- OK. This is it.

65
00:03:48,970 --> 00:03:50,510
Could I get in your backpack? Come on.

66
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:52,970
- That's too tight. OK. All right.
- Come on.

67
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:55,100
I'll make you proud
if I could just go to orientation.

68
00:03:55,220 --> 00:03:57,430
- No! You're my baby.
- Everybody left already.

69
00:03:57,560 --> 00:04:00,140
- All right. OK.
- I'll call you when I get to the dorm.

70
00:04:00,270 --> 00:04:02,230
- Wear deodorant, deodorant. Every day.
- Come on.

71
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:03,810
- OK, honey? It's important.
- Come on, honey.

72
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:05,940
- Cos you're a man now.
- Honey, we got to beat the traffic.

73
00:04:06,070 --> 00:04:07,150
All right.

74
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:10,320
- Wow! They really...
- Are embarrassing.

75
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:13,030
- I was gonna say "love you".
- Sorry.

76
00:04:14,530 --> 00:04:16,280
Hey, Cam, check those out.

77
00:04:16,410 --> 00:04:19,330
Those are the limited edition
gunmetal Nike Dunks.

Uh-oh. I know that look. OK, Moose,
seriously, next on the tour, Union Square.

79
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:28,260
I just wanna get a closer look.
I'm gonna be right back. OK? Cover me.

80
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:29,840

00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:48,440
- I want 25 on Kid Darkness.

Yo, I want ten on the skinny kid.

could dance like that.

- I'm actually an engineering major.
- But you're gonna be dancing too.

141

No, no, no, not any more.

142
00:08:08,140 --> 00:08:11,480
I mean, dancing was cool in high school,
but it's time for me to face the real world.

what you did back there, do you?

- What's a B-FAB?

- Born from a boombox.

others are born to.

they're gearing up for this.

00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:29,160
Around here, dance is your identity.

169
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:31,950
We live together, work together,
battle together.

170
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:35,000
But unlike other crews,
we all have different styles.

171
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:39,040
I found all these guys out in the city.
Crazy talent but no place to go.

172
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:41,750
We've become kind of a pseudo family here

173
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:43,880
where we can be ourselves
and rules don't apply.

174
00:10:44,010 --> 00:10:47,180
This place is off the chain.

175
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:50,260
Thing 1 and Thing 2 over there,
that's the Santiago twins.

176
00:10:50,390 --> 00:10:53,600
You, man, you... We saw you dancing
at the park this morning. You were...

177
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:55,810
- Amazing!
- You are from another planet.

178
00:10:55,940 --> 00:10:59,440
- Your own planet! You're amazing, man.
- l have a question...

179
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:02,770
No, no, no, guys. Come on. No questions.
I gotta show him around.

180
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:04,780
Got it! Come on.

181
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:05,860
You're great!

182
00:11:05,990 --> 00:11:07,950
- Luke.
- Jacob!

183
00:11:08,070 --> 00:11:09,700
What's up, brother?

184
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:12,080
- Meet Moose.
- Pleased to meet you, Moose.

185
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:14,490
This guy right here,
he's the captain of the ship.

186
00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:18,460
More like the first mate. I heard you did
some impressive work in the park today.

187
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:19,790
How does everybody know that?

188
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:22,590
News travels fast when you beat someone
like Kid Darkness.

189
00:11:22,710 --> 00:11:25,590
But, Luke, l need to borrow you
for one second. We've got some things...

190
00:11:25,710 --> 00:11:28,130
- Can we wait? I've got to show him around.
- We'll take him.

191
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:29,340
Let us show him around.

192
00:11:29,470 --> 00:11:31,220
- I don't know about that, guys.
- Please!

193
00:11:31,350 --> 00:11:33,220
- Please. What would Jesus do?
- Come on.

194
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:35,720
- All right. Don't hurt him, all right?
- Promise.

195
00:11:35,850 --> 00:11:38,060
Moose, this is the Ticks. Good luck.

196
00:11:38,190 --> 00:11:40,650
(Excited chatter)

197
00:11:40,770 --> 00:11:42,940
This came from the bank today.

198
00:11:43,070 --> 00:11:44,770
We're six months late on our payments.

199
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:47,360
- We paid them last month.
- What about the other five?

200
00:11:47,490 --> 00:11:49,820
We're working on it.
The club's not making the money it used to.

201
00:11:49,950 --> 00:11:52,280
The bank doesn't want to hear that.

202
00:11:52,410 --> 00:11:55,790
If they don't get the money they're going
to put the Vault up for public auction.

203
00:11:55,910 --> 00:11:58,290
Listen, don't I always have a plan?

204
00:11:58,410 --> 00:12:02,170
This kid, Moose, he beat Kid Darkness
today, and he did it with style.

205
00:12:02,290 --> 00:12:04,960
With a little bit of training,
he could be the spark that we need

206
00:12:05,090 --> 00:12:08,550
to win the hundred grand from
the World Jam and pay back what we owe.

207
00:12:08,670 --> 00:12:13,180
Jacob, we're not gonna lose the Vault,
all right? We won't let that happen.

208
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:16,600
(Tick 2) You don't understand. Nobody ever
smoked Kid Darkness and got it on tape.

209
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:18,220
(Pirates) Whoo!

210
00:12:18,350 --> 00:12:20,270
- That was serious.
- You're the man.

211
00:12:20,390 --> 00:12:22,400
You think the Samurais
are gonna let you go like that?

212
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:24,770
They'll find you and they'll batter you again.

213
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:26,770
- Sam who?
- The House of Samurai.

214
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:28,650
The most cut-throat house in the city.

215
00:12:28,780 --> 00:12:30,530
- Our fiercest rival.
- Yeah.

216
00:12:30,650 --> 00:12:32,030
They're gonna find me?

217
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:35,200
They got technology out there,
like the bears with a little GPS inside.

218
00:12:35,330 --> 00:12:37,540
- Watch out, they're right behind you!
- (Laughter)

219
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:40,200
Come on, that's enough.
Don't let them freak you out.

220
00:12:40,330 --> 00:12:42,830
- You're with us now.
- And nobody messes with us.

221
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:45,500
- Not even the Samurai.
- Not unless you want to get roasted!

222
00:12:45,630 --> 00:12:47,000
(Cheering)

223
00:12:47,130 --> 00:12:51,090
Unless they want to get
a big patata in their traste!

224
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:52,970
(Both speaking Spanish)

225
00:12:55,930 --> 00:12:57,470
- What?
- OK, you don't get it

226
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,850
but I know what I'm saying.

227
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:01,640
(Chatter continues)

228
00:13:01,770 --> 00:13:04,150
(Twins) You got it.

229
00:13:05,150 --> 00:13:07,070
- That's not boring.
- (Tick 2) Losers.

230
00:13:07,190 --> 00:13:09,190
(Chatter continues)

231
00:13:10,150 --> 00:13:13,860
She's back.
The one I've been telling you about.

232
00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:18,030
Hey, Moose. Come on,
I'll show you round the club downstairs.

233
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:21,330
- Party pooper!
- (Tick 3) Come on, Luke.

234
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:23,830
Come on, this way.

235
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:26,830
(♪ T-Pain: Take Your Shirt Off)

236
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:33,340
Oh!

237
00:13:33,470 --> 00:13:35,970
What? What?

238
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:38,300
(Luke) Watch out, they bite.

239
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:41,430
(Cheering)

240
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:48,060
Crazy, right? Hang out, take a look around.
I'll be back in a second.

241
00:14:02,410 --> 00:14:05,960
(♪ Static Revenger & Richard Vission
ft. Luciana: l Like That)

242

243
00:14:42,830 --> 00:14:44,200
(Crowd groans)

244
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:28,000
(Muffled music)

245
00:15:38,470 --> 00:15:40,300
(Toilet flushes)

246
00:15:53,570 --> 00:15:56,030
Nobody battles the Samurai just once.

247
00:15:58,820 --> 00:16:00,280
Now it's time for the real battle.

248
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:04,080
- (Samurai laughs)
- Come on, now, you scared?

249
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:06,200
Come here, man.

250
00:16:06,330 --> 00:16:08,040
(♪ Dance music)

251
00:16:15,710 --> 00:16:18,760
Where do you think you're goin'?
This ain't over yet.

252
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:23,850
Get him, Baba, get him.

253
00:16:27,140 --> 00:16:28,100
Ow!

254
00:16:28,230 --> 00:16:29,770
Go get the kid!

255
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:41,240
(Cheering)

256
00:17:11,940 --> 00:17:15,060
I just want a few rounds with the kid.
We got some unfinished business.

257
00:17:15,190 --> 00:17:17,480
You wanna get to him,
you gotta go through us.

258
00:17:18,190 --> 00:17:21,110
Come on, Luke. Be a good sport.

259
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:23,650
- What are you doing here, Julien?
- Nice to see you, too.

260
00:17:23,780 --> 00:17:25,700
Get your boys and get off our property.

261
00:17:25,820 --> 00:17:29,120
Your property? It's not gonna be
your property for much longer.

262
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:32,040
And don't worry. When I buy this place,
I'll take good care of it.

263
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:35,750
When we win the World Jam, you and your
trust fund won't be able to touch us.

264
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:37,880
(Crowd) Whoa.

265
00:17:40,630 --> 00:17:43,470
That's cute.
Your boy can't even finish his battles.

266
00:17:43,590 --> 00:17:45,800
Bubbles and balloons? That's so amateur.

267
00:17:45,930 --> 00:17:48,260
Enough, man. He will finish it
at the World Jam and so will we.

268
00:17:48,390 --> 00:17:50,060
I don't even know what you just said.

269
00:17:50,180 --> 00:17:52,520
Yo, man, stop being disrespectful
to my crew, yo.

270
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:53,640
(Hubbub)

271
00:17:58,520 --> 00:18:00,780
Get off!

272
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:02,570
Hey.

273
00:18:04,610 --> 00:18:07,410
Come on, I'll get you out of here.
Get off her, man.

274
00:18:11,290 --> 00:18:13,290
- Are you OK?
- Yeah.

275
00:18:14,370 --> 00:18:16,210
Thank you.

276
00:18:17,250 --> 00:18:18,830
I'm Luke.

277
00:18:19,590 --> 00:18:21,380
I'm Natalie.

278
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:23,970
So, what's with the bags?

279
00:18:24,090 --> 00:18:28,590
Oh. I'm supposed to be meeting my friend
here but I guess she's a no-show.

280
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:31,180
Well, what are you gonna do?

281
00:18:31,310 --> 00:18:33,390
I don't know, I haven't figured that out yet.

282
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:35,480
You could stay here.

283
00:18:36,310 --> 00:18:40,110
- What, in the club?
- No, I mean upstairs, in the living room.

284
00:18:42,530 --> 00:18:44,440
You don't even know me.

285
00:18:44,570 --> 00:18:48,410
Yeah, I do. Your name's Natalie
and you need a place to sleep.

286
00:18:51,370 --> 00:18:54,250
OK. Sure, thank you.

287
00:18:54,370 --> 00:18:56,410
OK. Grab your stuff.

288
00:18:56,540 --> 00:18:58,540
(Shouting)

289
00:19:09,340 --> 00:19:11,010
Are you sure they won't mind?

290
00:19:11,140 --> 00:19:14,140
Everyone here knows what it's like
to be a nomad.

291
00:19:15,890 --> 00:19:18,890
- So where are you from?
- Here.

292
00:19:19,020 --> 00:19:21,110
But I've been living in London
the last few years.

293
00:19:21,230 --> 00:19:22,310
Wow.

294
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:25,690
Well, this place'll be a departure.

295
00:19:25,820 --> 00:19:27,240
Thank you.

296
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:29,160
You're welcome.

297
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:34,080
So, are you ready?

298
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:35,370
For bed?

299
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:39,500
No, for the battle. The World Jam?
We could really use someone like you.

300
00:19:39,620 --> 00:19:43,210
- Are you up for a little competition?
- lt's what l live for.

301
00:19:43,340 --> 00:19:45,670
- Been competing my whole life.
- Do you win?

302
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:47,170
I never lose.

303
00:19:47,970 --> 00:19:49,010
Good.

304
00:19:50,550 --> 00:19:54,390
I'll see you in the morning.
We have a lot of work to do.

305
00:20:03,940 --> 00:20:07,820
Moose. Where were you yesterday?
I thought we had plans.

306
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:10,200
- I know, I know. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- Sorry?

307
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:14,280
I had to eat dinner with my freakazoid
roommate who smells so badly.

308
00:20:14,410 --> 00:20:17,700
And she would not stop yammering
about her pet rat's blog.

309
00:20:17,830 --> 00:20:20,120
We should hook our roommates
up together.

310
00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:23,000
Mine looks like a pet rat.
He's got the nose and everything,

311
00:20:23,130 --> 00:20:26,130
- he's got, like, the claws. Ugh!
- (Laughs)

312
00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:28,590
Oh. There you go!

313
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:30,970
Now I need you to help me find
this engineering lab.

314
00:20:31,090 --> 00:20:33,260
- Moose.
- What?

315
00:20:34,430 --> 00:20:36,220
(Sighs)

316
00:20:36,350 --> 00:20:39,480
- What would I do without you?
- l don't know. l really don't.

317
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:43,400
(She sighs)

318
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:45,480
Later, gator.

319
00:20:45,610 --> 00:20:47,610
(Muffled music)

320
00:21:09,630 --> 00:21:11,630
(♪ Dance music)

321
00:21:21,940 --> 00:21:24,520
I see you've found the speaker room.

322
00:21:24,650 --> 00:21:26,860
- Yeah.
- (Music stops)

323
00:21:26,980 --> 00:21:30,360
I built this myself when we could actually
find boomboxes in the city.

324
00:21:30,490 --> 00:21:32,440
- Impressive.
- (Laughs)

325
00:21:32,570 --> 00:21:34,950
- You're up early.
- Already warmed up.

326
00:21:35,070 --> 00:21:39,240
Good. Cos you're my new recruit.
It's my responsibility to get you up to speed.

327
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:42,870
- Then let's train.
- No, no, no. We're not training here.

328
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,290
OK. Then where?

329
00:21:44,420 --> 00:21:46,080
Out there.

330
00:21:47,170 --> 00:21:48,670
Just try to keep up.

331
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:50,880
(♪ Dance music)

332
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:07,810
Before we divide up into lab groups
and begin the work, though,

333
00:22:07,940 --> 00:22:11,980
I wanna talk to you about,
well, what engineering means to me.

334
00:22:12,530 --> 00:22:13,650
What's your name?

335
00:22:13,780 --> 00:22:16,030
(Teacher) And what hopefully engineering
will mean to you.

336
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:18,320
Silence, that's my name.

337
00:22:18,450 --> 00:22:21,290
- Silence during class.
- (Teacher) Second of all...

338
00:22:33,550 --> 00:22:35,720
(Phone ringing)

339
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:38,260
Go answer it, Mr Popular.

340
00:22:48,730 --> 00:22:50,270
(Laughs) What?

341
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:54,650
Open up the cages, boys. Show these
newbies why we call this the Vault.

342
00:22:54,780 --> 00:22:56,610
(Twin 1 ) OK.
(Both) Hey.

343
00:22:56,740 --> 00:22:59,110
Moose boy. How are you, my friend?

344
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:01,910
- Oh. What a beautiful senorita.
- Por favor.

345
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:03,240
Nice to meet you.

346
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:06,460
- Can I give you two?
- (Laughs)

347
00:23:06,580 --> 00:23:07,500
Come on.

348
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:09,750
- You gonna get mad at me?
- I'm not gonna get mad at you.

349
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:11,750
I'm just saying hi to her, man.

350
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:14,130
- I'm introducing myself.
- No, no, no.

351
00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:17,380
You stopped me when I'm introducing
myself to this beautiful...

352
00:23:17,510 --> 00:23:19,720
- Don't listen to him. Don't listen.
- You are so cute.

353
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:21,930
- (Both speak Spanish)
- OK.

354
00:23:23,060 --> 00:23:27,230
Ladies and gentlemen,
our most prized possessions.

355
00:23:34,110 --> 00:23:35,990
Check it out.

356
00:23:36,110 --> 00:23:39,780
(Twin 2) If dance is our weapon,
then this is our armour.

357
00:23:39,910 --> 00:23:42,070
These are the most beautiful shoes
in the world.

358
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:45,910
- The way they smell, the way they fit.
- (Twin 1 ) You're sounding like a girl, man.

359
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:47,710
You're like, "I love the shoes."

360
00:23:47,830 --> 00:23:51,500
You gotta say, "I love the shoes,"
like a macho man. OK, bro.

361
00:23:51,630 --> 00:23:54,250
Luke's lucky shoes? Smart boy.

362
00:23:54,380 --> 00:23:58,010
(Luke) OK, Moose, don't get too attached,
you gotta earn your kicks in this house.

363
00:23:59,050 --> 00:24:02,090
And beyond door number two,
the Graffiti room.

364
00:24:02,220 --> 00:24:03,140
Oh, what?

365
00:24:03,260 --> 00:24:05,600
- Who's that guy?
- That? That's Jason.

366
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:09,850
He's our graffiti guru. l'm talking
electronic billboard hacks, LED lights,

367
00:24:09,980 --> 00:24:11,190
anything to mark who we are.

368
00:24:11,310 --> 00:24:15,440
Dudes! Excellent timing. l have been
working on a portable light tagging system

369
00:24:15,570 --> 00:24:18,150
and I can't figure out how to get it to stick
to 12V batteries...

370
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:21,070
- You got any electrical tape?
- Yeah, there you go.

371
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:24,370
Tape it right there, wrap it round
and it creates a snug fit.

372
00:24:24,490 --> 00:24:26,580
- You know lights?
- Yeah, I dabble.

373
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:28,660
Check it out.

374
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:32,790
You... Yes! Yes! I love this kid!

375
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:35,420
Fix the LED to the battery to the magnet.

376
00:24:35,550 --> 00:24:38,340
They're beautiful.
Like neon fireflies.

377
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:41,180
- Neoflies.
- Yeah, neoflies.

378
00:24:41,300 --> 00:24:43,140
Neoflies. I like it.

379
00:24:43,550 --> 00:24:45,260
(Chatter)

380
00:24:45,390 --> 00:24:46,720
Cool. Check it out.

381
00:24:46,850 --> 00:24:49,640
Yeah, we could do something with this.

382
00:24:51,230 --> 00:24:52,560
- (Carlos whistles)
- Neoflies.

383
00:24:52,690 --> 00:24:55,730
Listen up. World Jam
is right around the corner,

384
00:24:55,860 --> 00:24:59,280
but to get there, we got to get through
the two qualifying rounds, which means...

385
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:02,320
Which means
we got a lot of work cut out for us.

386
00:25:02,450 --> 00:25:04,700
Moose, Natalie. Are you guys in?

387
00:25:04,820 --> 00:25:06,450
(Plays suspenseful music)

388
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:08,870
Erm...

389
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,040
I don't know,
I mean, I have to go to school...

390
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:12,580
We'll figure something out.

391
00:25:12,710 --> 00:25:15,500
Pirates... Pirates...

392
00:25:15,630 --> 00:25:20,460
(Chanting) Pirates! Pirates! Pirates!

393
00:25:20,590 --> 00:25:23,340
- I can do one battle, guys.
- (Cheering)

394
00:25:23,470 --> 00:25:25,050
All right, all right. Natalie?

395
00:25:25,180 --> 00:25:26,350
House of Pirates!

396
00:25:26,470 --> 00:25:28,010
(Cheering)

397
00:25:30,140 --> 00:25:32,140
(♪ Chromeo: Fancy Footwork)

398
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:43,360
(He laughs)

399
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:10,720
(Twin 2) Go, go, go, go, go.

400
00:26:17,770 --> 00:26:18,810
(Tick) Owww!

401
00:26:23,650 --> 00:26:24,780
Whoo!

402
00:26:25,450 --> 00:26:26,450
Yeah!

403
00:26:33,660 --> 00:26:34,710
Whoo!

404
00:27:48,860 --> 00:27:50,160
Whoo-hoo!

405
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:12,220
(AnaIa) l'm more of myself when
l dance than any other moment of the day.

406
00:28:12,350 --> 00:28:14,930
(Vlado) I dance to become someone eIse.

407
00:28:15,770 --> 00:28:20,600
(Jacob) They aIways think that we are just
a bunch of kids with no direction,

408
00:28:20,730 --> 00:28:23,940
but what we do is very hard.
We make it Iook easy.

409
00:28:24,070 --> 00:28:27,360
You spin and your equilibrium is off
and you stand up,

410
00:28:27,490 --> 00:28:31,030
and aII you have to reIy on
is how well you know your body

411
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:34,830
and you place your two feet on the floor,
finding your horizon within yourself.

412
00:28:34,950 --> 00:28:36,700
- Wow.
- Hey.

413
00:28:36,830 --> 00:28:38,660
- This is quite the setup.
- Thanks.

414
00:28:38,790 --> 00:28:40,960
I collect footage of dancers who inspire me.

415
00:28:42,250 --> 00:28:44,380
Clearly. (Laughs)

416
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:47,000
What are you gonna do with it all?

417
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:50,590
l don't know. Nothing.
I just play around with it.

418
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:54,640
(Jason beatboxing)

419
00:28:56,470 --> 00:28:58,350
Check this out... Check...

420
00:28:58,470 --> 00:29:00,390
Check-check...

421
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:01,810
I dance...dance...

422
00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:03,730
..become someone eIse.

423
00:29:03,860 --> 00:29:05,440
We were born...

424
00:29:05,570 --> 00:29:07,230
b-b-born from a boombox.

425
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:10,280
- I had no idea.
- They're amazing, aren't they?

426
00:29:10,650 --> 00:29:12,110
I mean you.

427
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:16,370
You're a film-maker.

428
00:29:17,330 --> 00:29:19,790
- What's wrong?
- Nothing, I...

429
00:29:19,910 --> 00:29:21,620
usually don't show people this stuff.

430
00:29:22,620 --> 00:29:24,710
It's just me.

431
00:29:27,710 --> 00:29:29,880
All right.

432
00:29:30,010 --> 00:29:31,840
- You're gonna show me?
- Yeah.

433
00:29:31,970 --> 00:29:33,970
OK.

434
00:29:35,300 --> 00:29:37,220
- Promise not to laugh?
- Oh, I promise.

435
00:29:37,350 --> 00:29:39,720
..or to choose a hobby,
or something Iike that.

436
00:29:39,850 --> 00:29:43,190
lt's another thing for that thing
to choose you.

437
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:45,980
- (Laughter)
- Jitterbug... Booty shake!

438
00:29:46,110 --> 00:29:47,150
- Yes!
- OK, OK.

439
00:29:47,270 --> 00:29:49,860
This is... This is our teacher in fifth grade.

440
00:29:49,980 --> 00:29:51,990
- Face-lift!
- Yes!

441
00:29:52,110 --> 00:29:54,070
Go. What are you?

442
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:56,450
- Raptor!
- Yes!

443
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:00,990
Whoo!

444
00:30:03,540 --> 00:30:05,460
How do you guys even do that?

445
00:30:06,830 --> 00:30:08,040
We can read each other's minds.

446
00:30:08,170 --> 00:30:11,340
Aw, you guys are so cute.
How long have you been dating?

447
00:30:11,460 --> 00:30:13,800
- Oh. No, no, no. It's not like that.
- (Phone rings)

448
00:30:13,930 --> 00:30:16,130
We're just...friends.

449
00:30:16,260 --> 00:30:17,430
(Clears throat) No.

450
00:30:17,550 --> 00:30:21,720
- Correction, everyone. We're best friends.
- (Both) Aw.

451
00:30:21,850 --> 00:30:24,270
Anyway, sorry, guys,
I have to go, I'm in a rush.

452
00:30:24,390 --> 00:30:28,150
- You're leaving? We just started.
- I'll call you later, though. Have fun.

453
00:30:28,270 --> 00:30:29,650
You guys lost.

454
00:30:29,770 --> 00:30:31,480
(Girls) Whatever!

455
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:33,940
Uh... OK...

456
00:30:35,530 --> 00:30:36,740
Gotcha.

457
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:44,580
Oh, wow. lt's so obvious,
it makes so much sense now.

458
00:30:44,710 --> 00:30:46,960
- What?
- You're totally in love with him, aren't you?

459
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:49,920
- No! No, no, no. It's...
- Yes, yes, yes.

460
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:51,710
..not like that, we're just...

461
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:55,760
Like, one of those, we grew up together.
No, that would be really weird.

462
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:57,930
Um... (Clears throat)

463
00:30:58,050 --> 00:30:59,340
I think it's your turn.

464
00:30:59,470 --> 00:31:00,510
- So...
- Me?

465
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:02,600
Yeah, you're up. You're up.

466
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:07,100
- OK.
- You go first.

467
00:31:09,310 --> 00:31:12,320
Um... Squirrel. Kangaroo?

468
00:31:14,070 --> 00:31:15,280
Keep trying.

469
00:31:19,620 --> 00:31:23,200
Hey. Look who's up early now.

470
00:31:24,290 --> 00:31:26,580
Actually, I haven't been to sleep yet.

471
00:31:27,670 --> 00:31:30,080
- Can I join you?
- Sure.

472
00:31:31,090 --> 00:31:33,920
- What are you looking at?
- l come out here to listen.

473
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:38,260
The river, the traffic, the birds.

474
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:42,430
Make me feel like
I'm part of something bigger.

475
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:46,480
Traffic makes you feel like
you're a part of something bigger?

476
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:48,270
That is deep.

477
00:31:48,390 --> 00:31:50,850
Like I said, I've been up all night.

478
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:57,990
So I've been thinking about your video
from last night.

479
00:31:58,110 --> 00:32:01,990
Like, l think you should finish it.
And you should show it to people.

480
00:32:03,790 --> 00:32:06,540
- Yeah, I don't know about that.
- Clearly you love it, right?

481
00:32:07,540 --> 00:32:10,670
Look at you, you've been up all night
and you're like...

482
00:32:10,790 --> 00:32:13,920
l don't know,
you're glowing or something.

483
00:32:14,050 --> 00:32:15,800
Glowing? (Laughs)

484
00:32:18,010 --> 00:32:19,800
I see a glow.

485
00:32:29,140 --> 00:32:30,730
We should get to Red Hook.

486
00:32:31,730 --> 00:32:33,150

00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:55,080
The Pirates are now into the next round

507
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:57,910
of the World Jam!

508
00:37:00,460 --> 00:37:03,290
(Crowd chants) Pirates! Pirates! Pirates!

509
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:12,180
(Luke) No, no, no.
(Twin 1 ) Yeah. Yeah!

510
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:16,430
Now it's time for you to be in front
of the camera, my good-looking Pirate.

511
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:18,470
Do you want some make-up, baby?

512
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:20,600
(Laughter)

513
00:37:21,310 --> 00:37:24,690
- (Natalie) So, Captain Luke...
- Gimme the camera.

514
00:37:24,810 --> 00:37:27,480
- (Twins) No, no, no.
- It's not that easy on this side, huh?

515
00:37:27,610 --> 00:37:30,860
- It's uncomfortable.
- (Luke) Yeah, why don't you keep walking?

516
00:37:30,990 --> 00:37:33,400
- (Jason) Oh, look at this guy.
- (Natalie laughs)

517
00:37:33,530 --> 00:37:35,450
What do you love about dance?

518
00:37:35,570 --> 00:37:40,700
l don't know. Dance music,
it's just always been there for me, I guess.

519
00:37:43,460 --> 00:37:45,460
(Natalie) Is that it?

520
00:37:46,590 --> 00:37:48,460
What? (Laughs)

521
00:37:48,590 --> 00:37:50,460
(Laughs) I know you can do better than that.

522
00:37:50,590 --> 00:37:52,470
- Come on.
- All right.

523
00:37:53,260 --> 00:37:55,180
My parents used to be dancers.

524
00:37:55,300 --> 00:37:58,220
And they started this place
for people like them,

525
00:37:58,350 --> 00:38:01,020
but that didn't just want to be
backup dancers.

526
00:38:02,230 --> 00:38:05,900
You know, do their own thing,
build their own respect.

527
00:38:06,650 --> 00:38:10,900
l thought that was cool, so l wanted
to carry on the tradition, in my own way,

528
00:38:11,030 --> 00:38:13,030
but for them, you know?

529
00:38:14,490 --> 00:38:18,450
So what do they think of you
turning this place into a madhouse?

530
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:23,040
They never got to see it.

531
00:38:29,380 --> 00:38:30,670
I'm so sorry.

532
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:33,300
No, don't be. It's OK.

533
00:38:34,340 --> 00:38:36,680
So that's why you're
so devoted to this place,

534
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:38,340
carrying on what your parents wanted?

535
00:38:38,470 --> 00:38:41,060
Family is family, you know?

536
00:38:41,180 --> 00:38:43,680
The Vault used to be their life,
and now it's mine.

537
00:38:45,060 --> 00:38:47,560
It's amazing what we do for family
sometimes.

538
00:38:47,690 --> 00:38:49,360
So, tell me about your parents.

539
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:50,610
(Laughs)

540
00:38:50,730 --> 00:38:52,980
They split up a while back.

541
00:38:53,110 --> 00:38:57,610
And me and my older brother, we were sort
of the dice that got rolled between them.

542
00:38:57,740 --> 00:38:59,370
Where's your brother now?

543
00:38:59,490 --> 00:39:02,830
We're still close.
I mean, he pretty much raised me.

544
00:39:02,950 --> 00:39:05,410
So I owe him everything.

545
00:39:09,380 --> 00:39:13,760
So, Tarantino, are you planning on
blackmailing us with all that footage?

546
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:15,300
No.

547
00:39:15,420 --> 00:39:16,880
Just you.

548
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:32,520
Hi. So, I'm sorry for being late, OK?
l won't...

549
00:39:32,650 --> 00:39:34,860
Oh! I'm so sorry.

550
00:39:34,990 --> 00:39:37,280
I thought you were somebody else.
I'm sorry.

551
00:39:38,490 --> 00:39:40,410
- OK...
- (Girls chatting)

552
00:39:40,530 --> 00:39:42,870
- Do you know that trick when they take...
- Really?

553
00:39:42,990 --> 00:39:46,330
They kinda look alike,
l think they're twins.

554
00:39:46,460 --> 00:39:49,250
Camille! What's going on?
I thought we had lunch.

555
00:39:49,380 --> 00:39:50,880
Is it lunch time?

556
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,290
Whoa! Um...

557
00:39:52,420 --> 00:39:55,630
Wow, we got so carried away
with the costumes, I lost track of time.

558
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:57,260
Costumes for what?

559
00:39:57,380 --> 00:40:01,640
It's for the dorm Halloween party. People
plan their costumes like all semester.

560
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:04,100
All right. So what are we going to go as?

561
00:40:04,220 --> 00:40:05,390
Oh, um...

562
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:07,020
Well, actually...

563
00:40:07,140 --> 00:40:09,190
I tried calling you but you didn't pick up,

564
00:40:09,310 --> 00:40:12,980
so Kristin and I are gonna be
the Olsen Twins.

565
00:40:15,690 --> 00:40:17,490
Wait, wait, wait. Kristin?

566
00:40:19,110 --> 00:40:20,530
Kristin?

567
00:40:20,660 --> 00:40:22,740
Camille, Kristin?

568
00:40:23,780 --> 00:40:25,870
What about Moose?

569
00:40:26,790 --> 00:40:28,790
Go ahead, you guys.

570
00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:33,790
You haven't exactly been around lately.

571
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:36,920
I mean, I couldn't wait forever.

572
00:40:38,420 --> 00:40:41,300
OK, well, hey, Camille,
look, I'm here now.

573
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:46,350
Come on, what do you say?

574
00:40:46,470 --> 00:40:49,680
You know you're gonna have
way more fun with me than...

575
00:40:49,810 --> 00:40:50,940
Kristin.

576
00:40:52,270 --> 00:40:54,730
Are you asking me to the dance?

577
00:40:57,320 --> 00:40:59,030
(Scoffs)

578
00:40:59,150 --> 00:41:03,950
Camillian? You know that I was born
to be the Ashley to your Mary-Kate.

579
00:41:04,070 --> 00:41:06,370
- Oh, really?
- Yes, really.

580
00:41:07,910 --> 00:41:10,120
OK, OK, fine.

581
00:41:10,250 --> 00:41:12,620
- I'll cancel with Kristin.
- Yes!

582
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:14,580
I'll see you later.

583
00:41:14,710 --> 00:41:17,090
Guess I'll see you later, then.
Get back to your frie...

584
00:41:17,210 --> 00:41:21,260
- Hey, Kristin! In your face!
- Bye.

585
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:24,140
(Luke) OK, you gotta stop complaining.
(Natalie) I'm sorry.

586
00:41:24,260 --> 00:41:27,260
I just feel ridiculous holding this giant cup.

587
00:41:27,390 --> 00:41:31,850
Whoever said it was OK to have a small,
medium, large and then ginormous?

588
00:41:31,980 --> 00:41:33,310
Hey, look.

589
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:38,570
- That's you.
- What are you talking about?

590
00:41:38,690 --> 00:41:40,780
- This guy looks exactly like you.
- He doesn't.

591
00:41:40,900 --> 00:41:43,950
He's got a camera popping out of his head,
pretty little cheekbones.

592
00:41:44,070 --> 00:41:47,580
It does not look like me, and I would not
be caught dead with those culture vultures.

593
00:41:47,700 --> 00:41:50,830
I've seen your work,
and you don't fool me.

594
00:41:50,950 --> 00:41:53,870
Yeah, but it's just for fun.
lt's nothing professional.

595
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:57,250
Well, what if the Pirates
and the rivalry didn't exist?

596
00:41:58,250 --> 00:42:00,300
Wouldn't you give your film-making a shot?

597
00:42:00,420 --> 00:42:02,800
That film academy sounds amazing.

598
00:42:02,930 --> 00:42:06,550
Yeah, but it's not an option,
so l don't think about it.

599
00:42:06,680 --> 00:42:08,600
The World Jam's our main focus.

600
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:12,140
- OK, so, tell me, then, how do you do it?
- Do what?

601
00:42:12,270 --> 00:42:14,560
Get all your amazing footage.

602
00:42:14,690 --> 00:42:17,980
I don't know. I just try to see things
that people don't normally see.

603
00:42:19,650 --> 00:42:21,650
Show me.

604
00:42:22,530 --> 00:42:23,570
All right, come here.

605
00:42:23,700 --> 00:42:24,820
(Natalie laughs)

606
00:42:24,950 --> 00:42:26,610
Where are you taking me?

607
00:42:26,740 --> 00:42:29,080
(Luke) Just trust me. Come on.

608
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:31,540
- Hurry up.
- All right.

609
00:42:33,080 --> 00:42:35,080
(♪ Laza Morgan: This Girl)

610
00:42:37,330 --> 00:42:39,420
- Just wait for it.
- For what?

611
00:42:42,630 --> 00:42:45,170
- What? (Laughs)
- Watch this.

612
00:42:51,720 --> 00:42:53,720
How did you do that? I'm going to do it.

613
00:42:53,850 --> 00:42:55,140
- OK.
- Try it.

614
00:42:55,270 --> 00:42:56,480
OK.

615
00:42:59,980 --> 00:43:02,360
See that? I did it!

616
00:43:06,860 --> 00:43:08,820
- There's Slurpee everywhere!
- (Laughs)

617
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:28,380
Oh, my God, my straw! I lost my straw!

618
00:44:12,890 --> 00:44:16,100
l think it was just being in my living room,

619
00:44:16,230 --> 00:44:20,310
and me and my brother
were just playing around together,

620
00:44:20,440 --> 00:44:24,110
- and l always tried to...
- (Phone ringing)

621
00:44:24,230 --> 00:44:26,230
..match him.

622
00:44:29,150 --> 00:44:32,320
- Moose.
- Yo. Hey, what time is the battle, again?

623
00:44:32,450 --> 00:44:35,540
- Eight o'clock. Why? You ready for it?
- Eight o'clock?

624
00:44:35,660 --> 00:44:38,790
lt all goes down in Chinatown.
This is the House of Gwai.

625
00:44:38,910 --> 00:44:41,540
They're champions of Asia,
so I hope you're prepared.

626
00:44:41,670 --> 00:44:45,710
- We've got a problem.
- No, this is round two. You gotta be there.

627
00:44:45,840 --> 00:44:48,760
We can't have any missing Iinks or we
could get eliminated from the World Jam.

628
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:52,510
l know, l know.
I have a test on the same exact day.

629
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:53,970
I don't know if I can...

630
00:44:54,100 --> 00:44:58,270
Listen, we need you.
Do whatever you can to make it work.

631
00:45:03,980 --> 00:45:07,690
(Teacher) l'm sure l don't need to
remind you how much this test counts.

632
00:45:07,820 --> 00:45:10,780
This is worth 25 per cent of your grade.

633
00:45:10,900 --> 00:45:13,910
Take your time. You may begin.

I'll go get a towel. I'll be right back.

You just ruined the floor.

(Anala) Our entire routine.

660
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:04,820
(Twin 1 ) lt's online?
(Jason) They know our whole set.

661
00:50:04,950 --> 00:50:07,280
- Who would do that?
- Julien and the Samurai.

662
00:50:07,410 --> 00:50:10,330
- How could they get our rehearsal footage?
- Does everyone have their DVDs?

663
00:50:10,450 --> 00:50:12,200
- You have the DVD?
- Yeah, I put them in the room.

We just got to figure something out.

665

OK, see there? If you could just let go
of that spin, we can land this thing.

Those guys may have our tapes,
but that won't stop us. Trust me.

Luke, l don't know.
Maybe somebody else should do it.

668

If we pull this off, we'll kill it on stage.
Julien won't even know what hit him.

671
00:50:41,360 --> 00:50:44,820
He used to be a Pirate.
We used to be best friends back in the day.

But as time went on, things changed.

00:50:47,070 --> 00:50:48,910
How do you mean, they changed?

674
00:50:49,030 --> 00:50:50,660
We found out he had a gambling problem.

675
00:50:50,790 --> 00:50:55,210
He wound up in debt. He bet against our
house and threw the battle to win the bet.

676
00:50:55,330 --> 00:50:57,330
He threw a battle to win a bet?

677
00:50:57,460 --> 00:51:01,250
The whole house was devastated,
so we had to kick him out.

678
00:51:01,380 --> 00:51:03,210
He's been trying to take us down
ever since.

679
00:51:03,340 --> 00:51:07,340
The crazy thing is, if we don't win
the World Jam he could actually do it.

680
00:51:48,010 --> 00:51:50,010
Hey.

681
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:53,310
- Welcome home.
- You lied to me.

682
00:51:54,270 --> 00:51:57,180
You told me Luke kicked you out
because he was jealous.

683
00:51:57,310 --> 00:52:00,190
But it wasn't that, was it?
You threw a battle for a bet?

684
00:52:00,310 --> 00:52:03,480
- Natalie...
- Don't! I went in there for you, Julien.

685
00:52:03,610 --> 00:52:05,940
I can't believe you stole that DVD
and put it online.

686
00:52:06,070 --> 00:52:09,030
What are you talking about?
What kind of BS did he say about me now?

687
00:52:09,160 --> 00:52:12,530
Luke was jealous. He wanted to be
the leader, so he kicked me out.

688
00:52:12,660 --> 00:52:14,660
He used me and he kicked me out.

689
00:52:20,460 --> 00:52:22,880
I'm sorry.

690
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:25,500
We have to stick together,
Natalie, you know that.

691
00:52:25,630 --> 00:52:28,010
I don't like to be lied to.

692
00:52:28,130 --> 00:52:32,050
I just want our house
to win the World Jam. OK?

693
00:52:32,180 --> 00:52:34,760
We have too much in this.
We've worked too hard.

694
00:52:34,890 --> 00:52:38,140
Despite what Mom and Dad say,
it doesn't always have to be about winning.

695
00:52:38,270 --> 00:52:42,310
You're starting to sound like him. You need
to remember whose side you're on.

696
00:52:42,440 --> 00:52:44,060
Friggin' ridiculous!

697
00:52:44,190 --> 00:52:46,110
Luke isn't some monster, Julien.

698
00:52:46,230 --> 00:52:48,990
He's a good guy.
He takes care of the people that he loves.

699
00:52:49,110 --> 00:52:51,610
Who are you going to believe?
Him or your family?

700
00:52:51,740 --> 00:52:53,240
You're going to talk to me about family?

701
00:52:53,370 --> 00:52:56,370
When Luke isn't even related to any of
those dancers, he would never lie to them.

702
00:52:56,490 --> 00:53:00,250
Oh. I'm a liar? What about you?

703
00:53:00,370 --> 00:53:02,330
How do you think your precious Luke

704
00:53:02,460 --> 00:53:05,500
is going to feel when he finds out
that you have been playing him?

705
00:53:05,630 --> 00:53:08,510
Actually, now that I think of it...

706
00:53:08,630 --> 00:53:10,050
you should come clean.

707
00:53:10,180 --> 00:53:12,720
That might be what I need
to throw his game off for World Jam.

708
00:53:12,840 --> 00:53:15,600
Thanks, sis. You really helped me.

709
00:53:15,720 --> 00:53:20,890
You're not putting him out on the streets
over some stupid rivalry.

710
00:53:23,480 --> 00:53:25,480
I will not be part of it.

711
00:53:41,210 --> 00:53:43,830
Jacob. You scared me.

712
00:53:43,960 --> 00:53:46,420
You don't seem like a girl
that's easily scared.

713
00:53:50,880 --> 00:53:52,470
Tell Luke I'm sorry.

714
00:53:57,720 --> 00:54:00,310
You have a choice, you know?

715
00:54:03,520 --> 00:54:05,020
It's not that easy.

716
00:54:05,150 --> 00:54:08,190
The most important decisions in life
are never easy.

717
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:27,000
(Jason) Dance can reveaI a Iot
about a person,

718
00:54:27,130 --> 00:54:29,840
the way they move,
the way they learn new steps.

719
00:54:29,960 --> 00:54:34,340
l mean, if you're dancing for real, it comes
from the most truthfuI part of your souI.

720
00:54:34,470 --> 00:54:36,930
I dance to express how I feel inside,

721
00:54:37,050 --> 00:54:39,970
whether it's anger, happiness,

722
00:54:40,100 --> 00:54:41,520
loneliness.

723
00:54:41,640 --> 00:54:44,100
Once I found the Vault,
it was like coming home.

724
00:54:44,230 --> 00:54:48,560
This is where I feel safe.
This is where l belong.

725
00:54:48,690 --> 00:54:50,360
This is where my family is.

726
00:54:50,480 --> 00:54:52,360
This place is special. It's our world.

727
00:54:52,490 --> 00:54:55,820
I think, finally,
I had somewhere I could be myself.

728
00:54:55,950 --> 00:54:59,240
People say that you don't
really choose your family. We did.

729
00:54:59,370 --> 00:55:02,120
- If you are one of us, Luke will find you.
- Yeah.

730
00:55:47,120 --> 00:55:50,380
- Luke.
- Why would she just leave like this?

731
00:55:50,500 --> 00:55:54,420
I don't know. But for the moment,
we've got bigger problems than that.

732
00:55:55,470 --> 00:55:57,470
The bank's put our house up for auction.

733
00:55:57,590 --> 00:55:59,680
- What?
- They're selling it.

734
00:56:01,470 --> 00:56:04,100
I'm going to deal with this, all right?

735
00:56:05,770 --> 00:56:08,020
- What the hell, Walter?
- Hey, Luke. How are you? Sit down.

736
00:56:08,140 --> 00:56:09,690
I don't want to sit down.

737
00:56:09,810 --> 00:56:11,400
I understand how hard this must be.

738
00:56:11,520 --> 00:56:13,900
If you can just wait a few days,
we'll have the money.

739
00:56:14,030 --> 00:56:15,820
You're five months behind
on your mortgage.

740
00:56:15,940 --> 00:56:17,530
Unless you catch up with your payments,

741
00:56:17,650 --> 00:56:20,070
I'm afraid there's nothing more
l can do for you.

742
00:56:20,200 --> 00:56:21,950
The warehouse sits on prime property.

743
00:56:22,080 --> 00:56:24,450
The bank is well aware
what it's going to go for at auction.

744
00:56:24,580 --> 00:56:27,750
- I need more time.
- I'll see if I can suspend the foreclosure.

745
00:56:27,870 --> 00:56:30,000
But don't get your hopes up.

746
00:56:30,120 --> 00:56:32,580
They could take
your warehouse today, Luke.

747
00:56:32,710 --> 00:56:35,550
That's not gonna happen
cos it's not for sale.

748
00:56:39,340 --> 00:56:41,090
(Luke) Look what I just got from Natalie.

749
00:56:41,220 --> 00:56:43,260
What does it mean?

750
00:56:43,390 --> 00:56:45,510
I don't know, but I'm going to find out.

751
00:56:49,850 --> 00:56:51,770
- Come with me.
- Who, me?

752
00:56:51,900 --> 00:56:54,440
- Yeah, I need you.
- I have a Halloween party tonight.

753
00:56:54,570 --> 00:56:56,610
I mean, I would, but I can't miss it.

754
00:56:56,730 --> 00:56:58,990
College parties start late.
l'll get you back in time.

755
00:56:59,110 --> 00:57:01,360
I'm supposed to be Ashley Olsen, man.

756
00:57:01,490 --> 00:57:02,570
Ashley Olsen?

757
00:57:02,700 --> 00:57:05,700
Yeah. You know how long it takes
to straighten this hair?

758
00:57:05,830 --> 00:57:07,830
Come on. You're my boy.

759
00:57:08,750 --> 00:57:12,330
It's been a long day, man.
I need a good friend right now.

760
00:57:13,080 --> 00:57:14,500
All right, I got your back.

761
00:57:20,510 --> 00:57:22,470
Oh. Invitations, please.

762
00:57:22,590 --> 00:57:27,100
- Invitations? I got one on my cellphone.
- No invite, no entry.

763
00:57:27,220 --> 00:57:28,810
Can you guys push off, please?

764
00:57:28,930 --> 00:57:31,770
- Just over there.
- My name's right there. It's Jeff Bernstein.

765
00:57:31,890 --> 00:57:33,900
- Check...Mr Bernstein.
- You know what?

766
00:57:35,310 --> 00:57:36,860
Thank you.

767
00:57:36,980 --> 00:57:38,980
Hey, how are you doing?

768
00:57:40,530 --> 00:57:41,990
There's got to be another way.

769
00:57:49,950 --> 00:57:51,750
Let's go.

770
00:57:53,290 --> 00:57:56,460
(Announcer) And now, the broken tango.

771
00:57:56,590 --> 00:57:58,340
Take it away.

772
00:57:58,460 --> 00:58:02,840
(Luke) Look, at this place, Moose. Come on.
(Moose) Where you going? Luke? Luke!

773
00:58:26,530 --> 00:58:28,410
(♪ Jazmine Sullivan:
Bust Your Windows)

774
00:58:46,760 --> 00:58:48,760
- Luke.
- I got you.

775
01:00:00,630 --> 01:00:02,630
Come with me.

776
01:00:09,970 --> 01:00:11,260
(Phone rings)

777
01:00:11,390 --> 01:00:12,720
(Chatter)

778
01:00:16,810 --> 01:00:19,640
Hey, Camille, we're all ready for the party.
You coming?

779
01:00:19,770 --> 01:00:22,940
l'm gonna meet you guys there.
Moose'll be here like any minute.

780
01:00:23,070 --> 01:00:26,150
Giddy up, girl! Yee-ha!

781
01:00:30,320 --> 01:00:32,320
I got something for you.

782
01:00:34,540 --> 01:00:35,910
I hope you like it.

783
01:00:36,040 --> 01:00:37,700
Your film?

784
01:00:38,920 --> 01:00:40,710
- You did it?
- Yeah.

785
01:00:40,830 --> 01:00:41,960
Luke.

786
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:44,960
I'm so happy you finished it.

787
01:00:54,220 --> 01:00:56,140
Let's get out of here.

788
01:00:56,270 --> 01:00:59,350
- No one can see us. We're fine.
- No, l mean let's leave.

789
01:01:00,140 --> 01:01:03,230
We could go anywhere. California, even.

790
01:01:03,360 --> 01:01:06,110
Come on, you can go to film school.
We can start fresh.

791
01:01:08,900 --> 01:01:09,900
(He sighs)

792
01:01:13,070 --> 01:01:16,790
Luke. I'm so glad you made it.

793
01:01:17,790 --> 01:01:22,670
You know, l was a little concerned
that you wouldn't get the invitation in time.

794
01:01:22,790 --> 01:01:25,710
- What are you doing here?
- Julien, you invited him?

795
01:01:25,840 --> 01:01:29,380
What? I just wanted to invite him
to come celebrate the birthday

796
01:01:29,510 --> 01:01:32,130
of my amazing and lovely sister.

797
01:01:33,550 --> 01:01:35,850
He's... He's joking, right?

798
01:01:35,970 --> 01:01:37,600
Wow.

799
01:01:38,350 --> 01:01:40,640
- I'm so sorry.
- Sorry?

800
01:01:40,770 --> 01:01:42,940
- This was all a lie, wasn't it?
- Yes, it was.

801
01:01:43,060 --> 01:01:45,360
- Shut up, Julien.
- Why? It was.

802
01:01:45,980 --> 01:01:49,610
Listen, at first it was,
and then I got to know you, OK?

803
01:01:49,740 --> 01:01:51,360
And I...

804
01:01:51,490 --> 01:01:52,950
I started to fall for you.

805
01:01:53,070 --> 01:01:55,490
And that was real,
that's why I had to leave.

806
01:01:56,990 --> 01:01:59,040
I'm... I'm so sorry.

807
01:01:59,160 --> 01:02:02,370
- Please tell me you believe me.
- Don't touch me.

808
01:02:02,500 --> 01:02:05,250
Luke, you...

809
01:02:08,840 --> 01:02:10,960
- You don't need to deal with...
- Don't, Julien!

810
01:02:12,010 --> 01:02:13,510
Don't worry about him. He's a loser.

811
01:02:13,630 --> 01:02:16,590
Natalie, are you really
getting mad about that?

812
01:02:28,360 --> 01:02:30,360
Camille.

813
01:02:31,530 --> 01:02:34,200
- Camille, I thought that you...
- I'm over it.

814
01:02:34,320 --> 01:02:36,450
You clearly have better things to do.

815
01:02:36,570 --> 01:02:39,660
- No, Camille, it's not like that.
- (Sighs)

816
01:02:39,790 --> 01:02:42,500
- Come on, I got caught up.
- Great. Thanks.

817
01:02:42,620 --> 01:02:45,330
I... I've been dancing.

818
01:02:49,130 --> 01:02:51,800
Before school, during school and after.

819
01:02:53,340 --> 01:02:58,890
So you've been lying to me
and ditching me for some secret life?

820
01:03:00,970 --> 01:03:03,220
I mean, you could have at least told me.

821
01:03:04,940 --> 01:03:09,650
But I guess I'm not important enough
in your new cool life to know.

822
01:03:11,650 --> 01:03:14,400
I should have just told you. I know.

823
01:03:14,530 --> 01:03:16,240
But I'm sorry, OK?

824
01:03:19,160 --> 01:03:21,160
And it's all over now.

825
01:03:21,290 --> 01:03:24,450
You're right. It's over now.

826
01:03:42,520 --> 01:03:45,770
- Luke. Luke, Luke.
- What the hell?

827
01:03:45,890 --> 01:03:48,400
- Hey, man, this is bullshit.
- (Jason) We tried to stop them,

828
01:03:48,520 --> 01:03:50,230
but there was nothing we could do.

829
01:03:50,360 --> 01:03:52,400
(Luke) We gotta get in there!
They can't do this to us!

830
01:03:52,530 --> 01:03:54,570
Luke! Hey.

831
01:03:54,690 --> 01:03:56,570
I grabbed as much as I could.

832
01:03:56,700 --> 01:03:58,610
It's Julien.

833
01:03:58,740 --> 01:04:01,990
- Julien's trying to buy the house.
- So what are we going to do now?

834
01:04:02,120 --> 01:04:04,910
Can't you see? We're finished.

835
01:04:05,040 --> 01:04:07,370
But the World Jam is just around the corner.

836
01:04:07,500 --> 01:04:10,670
- But if we have nowhere to rehearse...
- We have nowhere to sleep.

837
01:04:10,790 --> 01:04:14,460
We're fooling ourselves,
thinking this place was going to last.

838
01:04:15,510 --> 01:04:17,170
I'm out.

839
01:04:19,760 --> 01:04:21,760
Anyone else?

840
01:04:32,310 --> 01:04:36,320
Hey, it's not your fault.
Julien started this.

841
01:04:36,440 --> 01:04:38,450
You guys deserve better than this.

842
01:04:38,570 --> 01:04:41,410
There's nothing more I can do.
l screwed up.

843
01:04:41,530 --> 01:04:43,950
The Pirates are done.

844
01:05:06,470 --> 01:05:07,470
We tried.

845
01:05:33,500 --> 01:05:35,290
(♪ Jessie J Cornish: Who You Are)

846
01:07:01,010 --> 01:07:05,590
Hi.

847
01:07:09,470 --> 01:07:11,470
So, on a scale of one to ten...

848
01:07:15,140 --> 01:07:16,980
how much do you hate me?

849
01:07:17,100 --> 01:07:19,110
I don't hate you, Moose.

850
01:07:20,520 --> 01:07:21,650
I miss you.

851
01:07:23,740 --> 01:07:27,990
And what's worse,
feeling like you don't miss me at all.

852
01:07:28,120 --> 01:07:30,830
I don't even matter to you any more.

853
01:07:32,660 --> 01:07:36,330
We spent all senior year
talking about NYU,

854
01:07:36,460 --> 01:07:40,250
the real world, facing it together.

855
01:07:42,340 --> 01:07:44,260
What changed?

856
01:07:47,260 --> 01:07:50,640
You're my best friend
in the whole wide world, Camille.

857
01:07:52,930 --> 01:07:55,640
And I never want to let that go.

858
01:08:02,400 --> 01:08:05,740
My mom just sent this in the mail.

859
01:08:10,120 --> 01:08:11,490
(Laughs)

860
01:08:12,700 --> 01:08:14,080
Oh, wow.

861
01:08:14,200 --> 01:08:15,790
That's priceless.

862
01:08:17,920 --> 01:08:19,920
Cam...

863
01:08:24,050 --> 01:08:26,050
I'm sorry.

864
01:08:30,890 --> 01:08:33,180
I missed dancing,

865
01:08:33,310 --> 01:08:35,310
but...

866
01:08:35,430 --> 01:08:37,730
I'm going to have to say
l miss you more.

867
01:08:38,690 --> 01:08:39,940
Really?

868
01:08:40,730 --> 01:08:42,190
Really, really.

869
01:08:43,770 --> 01:08:45,190
(Faint music)

870
01:08:45,320 --> 01:08:47,530
- You hear that?
- What?

871
01:08:47,650 --> 01:08:49,610
- Do you hear that right now?
- What?

872
01:08:49,740 --> 01:08:52,160
- Come here.
- What?

873
01:08:52,280 --> 01:08:53,450
What?

874
01:08:55,330 --> 01:08:57,750
Are you serious? No, back of the line.

875
01:08:57,870 --> 01:08:59,660
Just one second, little girl. One moment.

876
01:08:59,790 --> 01:09:01,790
- l'm sorry.
- Hey, can you turn that song up a bit?

877
01:09:01,920 --> 01:09:04,000
Do I look like a jukebox to you, pal?

878
01:09:05,170 --> 01:09:06,550
Um...

879
01:09:06,670 --> 01:09:07,630
How about five bucks?

880
01:09:07,760 --> 01:09:10,880
- Give me that. I'll be right back.
- OK.

881
01:09:11,010 --> 01:09:12,340
(Music gets louder)

882
01:09:12,470 --> 01:09:13,720
(They laugh)

883
01:09:13,850 --> 01:09:15,640
- Oh, my gosh.
- MSA freshmen year. We met...

884
01:09:15,760 --> 01:09:17,010
(Both) To this song!

885
01:09:17,140 --> 01:09:19,810
- This is ridiculous.
- (Moose) Remember the choreography?

886
01:09:20,730 --> 01:09:23,150
- Step forward... Come on, let's try it.
- No, not a chance.

887
01:09:23,270 --> 01:09:25,190
Dance with him! Please!

888
01:09:25,320 --> 01:09:27,780
- Go.
- You heard the kid. Come on.

889
01:09:29,360 --> 01:09:31,360
All right.

890
01:09:32,870 --> 01:09:34,780
(♪ I Won't Dance)

891
01:09:34,910 --> 01:09:37,290
Moose, stop! Oh, my gosh!

892
01:09:39,200 --> 01:09:41,210
OK, not in public.

893
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:43,920
I'm sorry.

894
01:09:44,040 --> 01:09:46,040
I'm not doing this.

895
01:09:47,380 --> 01:09:48,590
Whoa! (Laughs)

896
01:09:49,590 --> 01:09:51,590
Moose!

897
01:09:52,720 --> 01:09:54,430
Hey!

898
01:09:54,550 --> 01:09:56,550
Give me my hat back!

899
01:10:19,700 --> 01:10:20,750
Whoo!

900
01:10:28,300 --> 01:10:30,800
What are you doing? Get out of here!

901
01:10:30,920 --> 01:10:33,590
Oh, man, you know what?
I'm gonna squirt you.

902
01:10:33,720 --> 01:10:36,720
I'm gonna squirt you! Get out of here!

903
01:10:39,310 --> 01:10:41,220
- Get outta here!
- Hey!

904
01:10:41,350 --> 01:10:42,680
I'm sorry.

905
01:10:56,240 --> 01:10:58,160
Come on! Come on! Get outta here.

906
01:10:58,280 --> 01:11:01,830
- Come on, gimme your scooter, kid.
- Hey, that's my scooter!

907
01:11:02,790 --> 01:11:05,250
You dented it, you freak!

908
01:11:34,950 --> 01:11:37,530
(She laughs, he cheers)

909
01:11:38,160 --> 01:11:40,280
Oh, my gosh,
you have leaves all over you.

910
01:11:41,410 --> 01:11:42,700
Oh, wow.

911
01:11:42,830 --> 01:11:45,710
(They sigh)

912
01:11:45,830 --> 01:11:49,920
You can never give it up.
You were born to dance.

913
01:11:50,040 --> 01:11:53,000
Give it up. You suck!

914
01:11:53,630 --> 01:11:55,050
Really?

915
01:11:55,920 --> 01:11:57,760
- Don't listen to them.
- (Laughs)

916
01:11:59,090 --> 01:12:02,310
- l know, but you gave it up.
- Yeah, cos I'm not like you.

917
01:12:03,140 --> 01:12:06,310
l'm a good dancer,
but, Moose, you're a great dancer.

918
01:12:08,310 --> 01:12:13,070
- My parents gave up everything...
- So you wouldn't have to. I know, I know.

919
01:12:13,190 --> 01:12:14,690
We can figure this out.

920
01:12:14,820 --> 01:12:16,820
Together.

921
01:12:18,780 --> 01:12:19,820
OK.

922
01:12:20,620 --> 01:12:22,530
(Makes explosive sound)

923
01:12:22,660 --> 01:12:25,790
- OK.
- Come on. Like my new hat?

924
01:12:26,200 --> 01:12:28,710
Hey, Vince,
I need a coffee on table eight.

925
01:12:29,920 --> 01:12:30,880
Everything all right?

926
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:33,000
What do I have to do to get a menu here?

927
01:12:33,130 --> 01:12:35,500
- What are you doing here?
- I have two things to say to you.

928
01:12:35,630 --> 01:12:37,170
I'll have an egg salad sandwich,

929
01:12:37,300 --> 01:12:39,590
and I still think we can win the World Jam
and get the house back.

930
01:12:39,720 --> 01:12:41,680
I'm out of egg salad sandwiches
and you're out of your mind.

931
01:12:41,800 --> 01:12:44,850
- l thought that's why you liked me.
- You're crazy. We have nobody left.

932
01:12:44,970 --> 01:12:47,810
But I'm here. Means we got one back.

933
01:12:47,940 --> 01:12:52,810
Luke, you're the only one that can get
everybody back together to save your house.

934
01:12:52,940 --> 01:12:55,520
- The Pirates just need your leadership.
- They don't need me.

935
01:12:55,650 --> 01:12:57,610
I took what my parents gave me
and threw it away.

936
01:12:57,740 --> 01:12:59,110
You don't know what you've done.

937
01:12:59,240 --> 01:13:02,910
Luke, you gave these people a place
where they can live out their dreams.

938
01:13:03,030 --> 01:13:05,200
- Sit down, man.
- Dude, I got tables to work.

939
01:13:05,330 --> 01:13:07,290
No, no, no, just take a seat.

940
01:13:07,410 --> 01:13:11,080
- This better be quick.
- You never asked why I wanted to dance.

941
01:13:11,210 --> 01:13:12,920
You want to know why?

942
01:13:13,040 --> 01:13:15,670
l dance
because dance can change things.

943
01:13:17,210 --> 01:13:21,380
One move can set
a whole generation free, like Elvis.

944
01:13:22,760 --> 01:13:23,680
Uh-huh.

945
01:13:23,800 --> 01:13:27,060
One move can make you believe there's
something more. Remember this one?

946
01:13:30,640 --> 01:13:31,560
Ow!

947
01:13:31,690 --> 01:13:34,020
Moose, sit down before
you make a fool out of both of us.

948
01:13:37,610 --> 01:13:40,240
And some moves...

949
01:13:40,360 --> 01:13:43,280
can give a skinny, curly-haired kid...

950
01:13:45,580 --> 01:13:48,080
that just wants to dance...

951
01:13:51,370 --> 01:13:53,540
some...some hope.

952
01:13:56,710 --> 01:13:58,710
Hope that he's actually special.

953
01:13:59,340 --> 01:14:02,470
Excuse me! Excuse me! Hello? Coffee?

954
01:14:02,590 --> 01:14:04,800
Decaf, don't want it. Regular.

955
01:14:06,180 --> 01:14:08,350
I'm sorry, I can't. I can't do regular.

956
01:14:08,470 --> 01:14:10,520
I tried. It's just not me.

957
01:14:10,640 --> 01:14:14,810
- I've been waiting here for 30 minutes.
- Hey, he can't do regular, the man said.

958
01:14:14,940 --> 01:14:18,270
Great, Fred Astaire. l didn't pay
for a floorshow. I paid for some coffee.

959
01:14:18,980 --> 01:14:22,110
OK, that's cool, Moose, but how are we
going to get everyone together?

960
01:14:22,240 --> 01:14:24,200
I had to get everybody here somehow.

961
01:14:26,910 --> 01:14:28,580
Man, did I miss you guys!

962
01:14:28,700 --> 01:14:31,040
My mornings are way too quiet
without you guys yapping.

963
01:14:31,160 --> 01:14:35,710
- You see? I told you he would miss us.
- Yeah, OK, OK, you're right.

964
01:14:35,830 --> 01:14:39,460
Look, I know the odds are against us.
We have no house, no routine.

965
01:14:39,590 --> 01:14:41,710
Hell, l don't even know
how we're going to do this.

966
01:14:41,840 --> 01:14:44,050
But I believe in us, and I know you do too.

967
01:14:44,180 --> 01:14:45,800
That's what I'm talking about.

968
01:14:45,930 --> 01:14:50,560
We've come way too far to stop now.
l know we can win this.

969
01:14:50,680 --> 01:14:53,390
(All sing) We be the Pirates!
We be the Pirates!

970
01:14:53,520 --> 01:14:54,770
We be the Pirates!

971
01:14:54,900 --> 01:14:57,020
We still don't have a place to rehearse.

972
01:14:57,150 --> 01:15:00,150
Don't worry about it.
Moose said he found us a place.

973
01:15:10,370 --> 01:15:11,740
Moose!

974
01:15:13,250 --> 01:15:16,830
- Kido!
- Doggone! There you are!

975
01:15:17,710 --> 01:15:19,630
(Both make explosive sound)

976
01:15:19,750 --> 01:15:22,130
- What's up?
- I miss you.

977
01:15:22,260 --> 01:15:24,340
I miss you. Come here, give me a hug.

978
01:15:25,680 --> 01:15:29,720
Guys, hey, this is Kido.
We used to dance together in high school.

979
01:15:29,850 --> 01:15:34,060
Am I missing something? What do these
games have to do with the World Jam?

980
01:15:34,180 --> 01:15:37,560
You said you needed space, right?
l got you, brother.

981
01:15:38,610 --> 01:15:40,980
- Brother?
- Come on.

982
01:15:41,530 --> 01:15:43,650
Nice to meet you.

983
01:15:47,360 --> 01:15:51,330
Come on. This way, watch your step.
You're gonna like this place.

984
01:15:51,450 --> 01:15:53,700
Just come.

985
01:15:54,700 --> 01:15:55,790
Da-da!

986
01:15:55,910 --> 01:15:57,830
See, I told you.

987
01:15:57,960 --> 01:16:00,630
Whoo-hoo! OK, I like it, man.

988
01:16:00,750 --> 01:16:03,090
(Tick 1 ) I used to love this game
when I was little.

989
01:16:03,210 --> 01:16:05,210
Who do they belong to?

990
01:16:05,340 --> 01:16:09,180
Oh, me. I watch them after school
because their parents work here.

991
01:16:09,300 --> 01:16:11,640
(Tick 1 ) l don't know.
Do you think this is gonna work?

992
01:16:11,760 --> 01:16:14,970
And there's so much junk. There's no room,
and we barely have any dancers.

993
01:16:15,100 --> 01:16:17,350
Yeah, and the Samurai,
they outnumber us two to one.

994
01:16:17,480 --> 01:16:20,020
- (Buzzer)
- He has a point.

995
01:16:20,150 --> 01:16:22,230
(Buzzer continues)

996
01:16:22,360 --> 01:16:24,150
Hold that thought.

997
01:16:26,400 --> 01:16:28,400
Come on.

998
01:16:32,450 --> 01:16:34,450
(♪ J. Cole: Who Dat)

999
01:16:43,170 --> 01:16:46,090
Oh, my God! MSA Crew!
Long time, no see!

1000
01:16:46,210 --> 01:16:49,130
Kido! You ruined our slow-motion thing!

1001
01:16:51,720 --> 01:16:53,800
Guys, I thought you might need
some extra dancers.

1002
01:16:53,930 --> 01:16:56,140
Pirates, meet the MSA Crew.

1003
01:16:56,270 --> 01:16:58,310
Hey, let's show them what we got.

1004
01:16:59,230 --> 01:17:01,190
(Moose) A highly good idea, Kido.

1005
01:17:01,310 --> 01:17:02,940
All right, so first up we got,

1006
01:17:03,060 --> 01:17:05,360
we got a floor master, Monster.

1007
01:17:07,490 --> 01:17:09,490
(Jason) Yeah, that's tight.

1008
01:17:10,280 --> 01:17:11,570
(Pirates) Whoo!

01:35:15,910 --> 01:35:18,660
"To traveI is better than to arrive."

1180
01:35:20,580 --> 01:35:22,580
And I was Iike, "What?"

1181
01:35:23,330 --> 01:35:26,000
Because l used to think that there is only

1182
01:35:26,130 --> 01:35:29,380
one path to take to where you want
to get to be in life.

1183
01:35:29,500 --> 01:35:31,000
But if you choose that one path,

1184
01:35:31,130 --> 01:35:33,590
that doesn't mean you have to
abandon aII the other ones.

1185
01:35:33,720 --> 01:35:38,680
l realise that it's actually what happens
along the way that counts.

1186
01:35:40,890 --> 01:35:42,970
The stumbIes

1187
01:35:43,100 --> 01:35:45,810
and the faIIs

1188
01:35:45,940 --> 01:35:48,400
and the friendships.

1189
01:35:48,520 --> 01:35:52,110
lt's the journey, not the destination.

1190
01:35:53,820 --> 01:35:55,950
You just gotta, l guess,

1191
01:35:56,070 --> 01:35:59,780
trust that the future wiII work itseIf out
Iike it's supposed to.

1192
01:36:00,740 --> 01:36:04,620
I mean, I guess I'm asking the school
to kinda go freestyle with me here,

1193
01:36:04,750 --> 01:36:06,080
but I'm ready to jump.

1194
01:36:06,210 --> 01:36:08,370
What you're asking for here

1195
01:36:08,500 --> 01:36:12,170
is a double major in engineering...

1196
01:36:13,130 --> 01:36:14,880
and dance.

1197
01:36:15,010 --> 01:36:16,590
Yeah.

1198
01:36:16,720 --> 01:36:19,180
Well, it's certainly a first.

1199
01:36:30,110 --> 01:36:32,440
So?

1200
01:36:33,690 --> 01:36:37,950
Yeah, l mean, l...
I'm a double major, so...

1201
01:36:38,070 --> 01:36:41,950
No way, Moose! Oh, my gosh!
Oh, my gosh! I can't believe it.

1202
01:36:42,080 --> 01:36:44,990
I can't believe it.
What do you mean, you can't believe it?

1203
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:48,000
Cam, thank you,
thank you for being there.

1204
01:36:49,670 --> 01:36:50,960
You're welcome.

1208
01:36:59,800 --> 01:37:02,720
will be departing in 1 5 minutes
from track eight.

1209
01:37:14,730 --> 01:37:17,530
What happened? Did you forget something?

1210
01:37:17,650 --> 01:37:20,450
- I think you forgot to say goodbye.
- Yeah.

1211
01:37:20,570 --> 01:37:23,320
Don't leave me, don't leave me, please!

1212

Senorita, please.
Come to Buenos Aires...

1213
01:37:27,120 --> 01:37:30,540
- Don't listen to him.
- No, listen. I kissed your hand, remember?

1214
01:37:30,670 --> 01:37:32,960
I'm going to miss you guys.

1215
01:37:37,050 --> 01:37:39,050
Give me a hug, give me a hug.

1216
01:37:41,970 --> 01:37:44,680
Come on, don't cry. Don't cry.

1217
01:37:47,270 --> 01:37:49,180
Where's Luke?

Hang on a second, OK? I'll be right back.

This is for you, man.

1229

I'll see you soon. Blow it up.

1230

You're B-FAB. Remember that.

Take care of the house, guys.
