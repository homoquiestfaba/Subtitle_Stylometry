1
00:01:12,472 --> 00:01:15,774
Watch where you're going, bitch!

2
00:01:15,776 --> 00:01:18,777
What? Thanks for cutting me off!

3
00:01:18,779 --> 00:01:21,513
You almost took
my side view mirror off, slut!

4
00:01:21,515 --> 00:01:23,816
You're lucky I have
to be somewhere,

5
00:01:23,818 --> 00:01:26,218
or I'd fuck
your ass up right now.

6
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:28,620
Fuck you! Fuck you!

7
00:01:37,797 --> 00:01:39,398
Did you call me a slut back there?
Yeah.

8
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:41,633
I don't even know
where that came from.

9
00:01:56,850 --> 00:01:59,918
You ready to get proud?
Oh, dude. Dude.

10
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:02,454
I'm here. I'm queer.

11
00:02:02,456 --> 00:02:04,823
Better get used to it.

12
00:02:04,825 --> 00:02:06,725
Hmm. Mmm.

13
00:02:06,727 --> 00:02:08,961
Oh, maybe I shouldn't touch you so
people won't think we're together.

14
00:02:08,963 --> 00:02:11,697
Oh, yeah. Get off me.
Stop cock-blocking me.

15
00:02:11,699 --> 00:02:14,399
Vagina-blocking?
No. Still cock-blocking.

16
00:02:14,401 --> 00:02:16,068
Doesn't make sense.
There's two vaginas.

17
00:02:16,070 --> 00:02:18,270
I don't know.
Nobody ever changed it.

18
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:33,812
Mmm, thank you for coming
to Pride with me today.

19
00:03:33,814 --> 00:03:35,647
Thank you
for letting me sleep over.

20
00:03:35,649 --> 00:03:38,383
I was way too tired to drive home.
As usual.

21
00:03:38,385 --> 00:03:40,819
Wait. Hey. Get... Get up.

22
00:03:40,821 --> 00:03:42,654
What? Wrong pillow.

23
00:03:42,656 --> 00:03:45,691
You like this one, stupid.
Orthopedic.

24
00:03:45,693 --> 00:03:47,392
Curvy. Fits your head.

25
00:03:47,394 --> 00:03:49,261
Oh.

26
00:03:50,597 --> 00:03:53,098
Oh, you're right. Oh!

27
00:04:01,641 --> 00:04:03,775
No.

28
00:04:03,777 --> 00:04:05,444
No.

29
00:04:07,314 --> 00:04:09,581
Wait. No, what about that girl?

30
00:04:09,583 --> 00:04:12,217
She's really cute,
and she lives two miles away.

31
00:04:12,219 --> 00:04:13,819
You could...
You could walk over there.

32
00:04:13,821 --> 00:04:17,623
And then if you don't like her,
you could just walk home. Mm-hmm.

33
00:04:17,625 --> 00:04:19,891
All right. Maybe later.
Why not now?

34
00:04:19,893 --> 00:04:23,562
Because it's 2:00 a.m. That's a
really bad first impression.

35
00:04:23,564 --> 00:04:27,933
She'll probably imagine me, like,
laying in bed flicking it.

36
00:04:27,935 --> 00:04:30,302
Flicking. Yes. Yes.

37
00:04:33,873 --> 00:04:35,974
Are you feeling yourself up?

38
00:04:36,943 --> 00:04:40,445
I have this weird dent
in my left boob.

39
00:04:40,447 --> 00:04:43,582
Is that a thing?
Like a reverse tumor?

40
00:04:43,584 --> 00:04:45,717
What? Let me see.

41
00:04:46,886 --> 00:04:48,754
No. I don't see anything.

42
00:04:48,756 --> 00:04:50,722
I see it. Oh, God.

43
00:04:50,724 --> 00:04:52,291
This is why
I don't have a boyfriend.

44
00:04:52,293 --> 00:04:54,159
'Cause I spend all my time
having sleepovers...

45
00:04:54,161 --> 00:04:56,662
and staring at my
lesbian best friend's boobs.

46
00:04:56,664 --> 00:05:00,299
You don't have a boyfriend
because you're way too picky.

47
00:05:00,301 --> 00:05:04,336
I just wanna meet a guy that I like as
much as you. Is that too much to ask for?

48
00:05:04,338 --> 00:05:06,938
Yes. Yes, it is.

49
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:09,241
I hate everyone but you.

50
00:05:09,243 --> 00:05:12,010
We're screwed.

51
00:05:19,252 --> 00:05:21,987
<i>Hey, I'm Shawneen,
and I'm from Omaha, Nebraska.</i>

52
00:05:21,989 --> 00:05:24,623
<i>I've never really
considered myself pretty.</i>

53
00:05:24,625 --> 00:05:26,825
Yeah, right,<i> Shawneen.</i>

54
00:05:26,827 --> 00:05:28,994
I don't buy for a second
you don't think you're pretty.

55
00:05:28,996 --> 00:05:31,196
You're on a show called
<i>America's Next Top Model.</i>

56
00:05:31,198 --> 00:05:32,831
You obviously think
you're pretty.

57
00:05:32,833 --> 00:05:34,966
She reminds me of Amanda
from Cycle 3.

58
00:05:34,968 --> 00:05:37,836
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Her eyes, they're so weird.

59
00:05:37,838 --> 00:05:40,005
Oh, Sasha. What?

60
00:05:40,007 --> 00:05:43,375
Amanda's eyes look like that
because she was legally blind,

61
00:05:43,377 --> 00:05:47,012
and I heard after the show
she went full-on blind.

62
00:05:47,014 --> 00:05:48,613
Whoops.

63
00:05:49,749 --> 00:05:51,883
Oh!

64
00:05:51,885 --> 00:05:53,518
Do you want this? No. No.

65
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,220
I'm starting
a new case tomorrow.

66
00:05:55,222 --> 00:05:57,289
It's my first one
without the partners.

67
00:05:57,291 --> 00:05:59,658
I gotta be firing
on all cylinders.

68
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:02,627
Well, lucky me. I don't have
to fire on any cylinders...

69
00:06:02,629 --> 00:06:05,297
to answer the phone all day.

70
00:06:05,299 --> 00:06:07,032
I can crash here, right?

71
00:06:07,034 --> 00:06:08,667
Uh, yeah, sure.

72
00:06:16,409 --> 00:06:18,844
Thank you. Thank you so much.

73
00:06:18,846 --> 00:06:21,246
Give me. Guys, quick question.

74
00:06:21,248 --> 00:06:24,383
Is Vanessa looking over here?

75
00:06:24,385 --> 00:06:26,718
Sasha, is she
talking to someone?

76
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:29,287
I don't know.
Jenn, look for yourself.

77
00:06:30,089 --> 00:06:33,058
Jen, is she? Is she?

78
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:35,894
Yeah. She seems pretty
into some girl. God.

79
00:06:35,896 --> 00:06:38,363
Well, you know what?
That's funny.

80
00:06:38,365 --> 00:06:41,266
'Cause I hope some girl knows that
Vanessa isn't in the mind space...

81
00:06:41,268 --> 00:06:43,535
to be monogamous right now, so...

82
00:06:43,537 --> 00:06:46,772
Jenn, you have to get over this Vanessa
thing. It's been like six months.

83
00:06:46,774 --> 00:06:49,941
I'm over it completely. I just think
it's funny that she said that,

84
00:06:49,943 --> 00:06:52,577
and then she started dating someone
monogamously like a week later.

85
00:06:52,579 --> 00:06:54,513
It's just, like,
insanely funny to me.

86
00:06:54,515 --> 00:06:56,148
Is it not to you? Like, what?

87
00:06:56,150 --> 00:06:58,216
Jen.

88
00:06:58,218 --> 00:06:59,851
Oh. Oh.

89
00:06:59,853 --> 00:07:03,221
Oh, my God, why is every
lesbian named Jen?

90
00:07:03,223 --> 00:07:05,690
I know. It's annoying. That's
why I spell mine with two Ns.

91
00:07:05,692 --> 00:07:07,426
I'm Jen 1.0.

92
00:07:07,428 --> 00:07:10,862
Why do you say that like that's a
good thing? 2.0 is better than 1.0.

93
00:07:10,864 --> 00:07:12,431
Maybe to you.

94
00:07:12,433 --> 00:07:14,266
Could you not sit
so close to me?

95
00:07:14,268 --> 00:07:15,967
I don't want anyone
to think that we're together.

96
00:07:15,969 --> 00:07:17,536
Oh, my God.

97
00:07:17,538 --> 00:07:21,440
Okay, but there's no one here that
we don't already know anyway.

98
00:07:21,442 --> 00:07:23,642
I'm telling you,
there is no one left.

99
00:07:23,644 --> 00:07:25,510
Well, there are
at least two people left...

100
00:07:25,512 --> 00:07:28,480
because Paige and I both
have dates tomorrow night.

101
00:07:28,482 --> 00:07:30,515
Thank you. Really?

102
00:07:30,517 --> 00:07:33,552
Oh, that's... that's... that's great.
That's awesome.

103
00:07:33,554 --> 00:07:36,855
Yeah, we got drunk and agreed to go
on Internet dates on the same night.

104
00:07:36,857 --> 00:07:38,957
And she is going out
with a doctor.

105
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:40,759
Yeah.

106
00:07:40,761 --> 00:07:44,229
What? What...
What is wrong with this one?

107
00:07:44,231 --> 00:07:46,731
He just says douchey things
in his e-mails,

108
00:07:46,733 --> 00:07:48,300
quotes a lot of movies...

109
00:07:48,302 --> 00:07:50,735
and says things like,
"You betcha" and "Gotcha."

110
00:07:50,737 --> 00:07:52,804
And in a couple of his photos,

111
00:07:52,806 --> 00:07:57,409
he's wearing, like, T-shirts with
messages on them and slogans.

112
00:07:57,411 --> 00:07:59,211
I think it's like his style.

113
00:07:59,213 --> 00:08:00,278
Ew.

114
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:01,980
Sorry. It's fine.

115
00:08:01,982 --> 00:08:05,050
I like the shirt, so...

116
00:08:05,052 --> 00:08:07,719
It's great. That one says a positive
message. It's true. Mm-hmm.

117
00:08:07,721 --> 00:08:10,222
What about you, Sasha?
Do we know her?

118
00:08:10,224 --> 00:08:12,557
Who's your date with?
Um, well, you might.

119
00:08:12,559 --> 00:08:15,160
Have you ever seen the show
<i>To Catch a Predator?</i>

120
00:08:15,162 --> 00:08:17,929
Love that show.
Well, she was on it.

121
00:08:17,931 --> 00:08:19,764
My date was on
<i>To Catch a Predator.</i>

122
00:08:19,766 --> 00:08:21,933
She works for the agency
that catches the predator.

123
00:08:21,935 --> 00:08:26,271
She... She goes online and flirts with old
dudes, pretending to be a 14-year-old.

124
00:08:26,273 --> 00:08:28,373
Oh, my God. Please marry her.

125
00:08:28,375 --> 00:08:30,242
She's a celebrity. Yeah. Yeah.

126
00:08:30,244 --> 00:08:31,877
I might.

127
00:08:31,879 --> 00:08:34,446
Oh, God, it's so funny.

128
00:08:34,448 --> 00:08:37,849
I just always had this feeling that
everyone was gonna couple up before me.

129
00:08:37,851 --> 00:08:41,131
I mean, it's fine. I just think
it's funny that I called it.

130
00:08:56,068 --> 00:08:58,203
Hey, what's up? I'm Trace.

131
00:08:58,205 --> 00:09:00,005
Sasha. Nice to meet you.

132
00:09:00,007 --> 00:09:01,573
Nice to meet you too. What's up?

133
00:09:01,575 --> 00:09:04,509
Not much. How are you? Oh.
I'm sorry I'm late.

134
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:07,679
Man, I had
an intense day at work.

135
00:09:09,249 --> 00:09:11,650
Ooh.

136
00:09:11,652 --> 00:09:13,718
What was intense about it?

137
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:15,921
I went on a sting today.

138
00:09:15,923 --> 00:09:18,390
Took down a board on a 4chan.

139
00:09:20,459 --> 00:09:23,061
Oh. I... What is 4chan?

140
00:09:23,063 --> 00:09:27,032
Oh. 4... 4chan's
an anonymous message board.

141
00:09:27,034 --> 00:09:28,967
Used to be
an image hosting site.

142
00:09:28,969 --> 00:09:31,209
Now it's a hotbed
for pedophilia.

143
00:09:31,637 --> 00:09:33,918
Crazy. Disturbing.

144
00:09:34,707 --> 00:09:36,274
Oh, my God.

145
00:09:37,777 --> 00:09:39,477
Are you okay? I'm sorry.

146
00:09:39,479 --> 00:09:43,281
It's so fucking annoying 'cause, like,
I'm here, and I just want to drink,

147
00:09:43,283 --> 00:09:45,216
and this guy is staring at me.

148
00:09:45,218 --> 00:09:47,385
I think he recognizes me
from TV.

149
00:09:47,387 --> 00:09:49,487
Oh, my God.

150
00:09:49,489 --> 00:09:51,623
Oh!

151
00:09:51,625 --> 00:09:54,326
Buddy, you got a pen?

152
00:09:54,328 --> 00:09:56,161
You want an autograph?

153
00:09:57,163 --> 00:09:59,497
No? Yeah, I didn't think so.

154
00:09:59,499 --> 00:10:01,433
Weird.

155
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:05,136
You are so beautiful.

156
00:10:05,138 --> 00:10:07,806
God, you're beautiful. Wow.

157
00:10:07,808 --> 00:10:11,309
Who tells you you're beautiful...
other than me?

158
00:10:19,051 --> 00:10:22,253
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. It's just...
It's really quiet in here.

159
00:10:22,255 --> 00:10:24,089
All I can hear are mouth sounds.

160
00:10:24,091 --> 00:10:26,625
I'm gonna put on some music.

161
00:10:26,627 --> 00:10:29,427
Uh-oh. Are you a control freak?

162
00:10:29,429 --> 00:10:31,162
What? No.

163
00:10:31,164 --> 00:10:33,765
No? Well, I just thought
there's this...

164
00:10:33,767 --> 00:10:36,267
and then you have,
like, four recycling bins.

165
00:10:36,269 --> 00:10:38,436
Well, uh, I<i> am</i>
an environmental lawyer...

166
00:10:38,438 --> 00:10:40,472
and clearly
a better person than you.

167
00:10:40,474 --> 00:10:43,341
Well, I don't know about that.
I'm the best there is.

168
00:10:43,343 --> 00:10:45,744
I wake up in the morning.
I piss excellence.

169
00:10:45,746 --> 00:10:47,412
What?

170
00:10:47,414 --> 00:10:51,282
Uh, Ricky Bobby,
<i>Talladega Nights.</i>

171
00:10:51,284 --> 00:10:53,652
Oh. I haven't seen that.

172
00:10:53,654 --> 00:10:55,820
Well, as long as
you've seen<i> Lebowski.</i>

173
00:10:55,822 --> 00:10:58,323
Uh, well, I've seen
the first half of it.

174
00:10:59,425 --> 00:11:01,292
What?

175
00:11:01,294 --> 00:11:04,362
Are you saying you watched the
first half of<i> The Big Lebowski,</i>

176
00:11:04,364 --> 00:11:06,131
then you shut it off?

177
00:11:06,133 --> 00:11:08,166
I... I feel like
you're treating me...

178
00:11:08,168 --> 00:11:10,468
as though I just told you
that I'm a sex offender.

179
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:13,405
Wow. That... I mean,
this is much worse,

180
00:11:13,407 --> 00:11:15,840
I have to tell you.

181
00:11:15,842 --> 00:11:18,610
My goodness.

182
00:11:18,612 --> 00:11:20,612
- Are you married?
- What?

183
00:11:20,614 --> 00:11:22,447
"Husband" is calling you.

184
00:11:22,449 --> 00:11:24,149
Oh. No.

185
00:11:24,151 --> 00:11:25,784
That's my best friend Sasha.

186
00:11:25,786 --> 00:11:27,619
We just have this stupid joke.
Mm-hmm.

187
00:11:27,621 --> 00:11:30,088
Okay, I'll prove it to you.

188
00:11:32,758 --> 00:11:35,326
- Hi, Sasha.
- <i> Okay, you're  answering the phone,</i>

189
00:11:35,328 --> 00:11:37,829
<i>which means you had just as
shitty of a date as I did.</i>

190
00:11:37,831 --> 00:11:40,432
<i>Or you just got really wasted and
fucked him like an hour into it...</i>

191
00:11:40,434 --> 00:11:42,000
<i>and he's already gone.</i> Uh...

192
00:11:42,002 --> 00:11:43,868
<i>Remember that? What was
that guy's name, Cory...</i>

193
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:46,404
- I'll call you back.

194
00:11:46,406 --> 00:11:49,474
Cory, huh? That, um...

195
00:11:49,476 --> 00:11:51,042
It only took Cory an hour?

196
00:11:51,044 --> 00:11:53,178
I... Um...

197
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:55,313
I don't usually
do things like that. Um...

198
00:11:55,315 --> 00:11:57,048
What were his moves?

199
00:11:57,050 --> 00:11:58,683
It was, um...

200
00:11:58,685 --> 00:12:01,052
You know what? I'm over it.
Okay.

201
00:12:01,054 --> 00:12:02,787
It's fine.

202
00:12:02,789 --> 00:12:05,790
We all have our Corys.

203
00:12:20,139 --> 00:12:22,040
Mmmmmmm.

204
00:12:40,293 --> 00:12:41,993
There you are.

205
00:12:41,995 --> 00:12:43,895
How was your date?

206
00:12:43,897 --> 00:12:45,463
Uh, you first.

207
00:12:45,465 --> 00:12:47,232
<i>Where do I start? Um...</i>

208
00:12:47,234 --> 00:12:50,368
Well, she is a baritone.

209
00:12:50,370 --> 00:12:53,872
Um, she has a tattoo of the
female symbol on her wrist,

210
00:12:53,874 --> 00:12:56,908
and her license plate
says "BABY BOI," with an "I."

211
00:12:56,910 --> 00:12:59,644
- Are you peeing?
- Yeah.

212
00:12:59,646 --> 00:13:01,946
<i>I love how you call me
right before you pee...</i>

213
00:13:01,948 --> 00:13:04,415
instead of just waiting the
10 seconds till you're done.

214
00:13:04,417 --> 00:13:06,284
<i>Hold on one second.</i>

215
00:13:06,286 --> 00:13:09,554
You're on speaker now.
I'm brushing my teeth.

216
00:13:09,556 --> 00:13:12,690
<i>I think that my favorite part
of the date...</i>

217
00:13:12,692 --> 00:13:15,126
<i>was when she put up
two fingers...</i>

218
00:13:15,128 --> 00:13:17,562
and said... "Sit on it."

219
00:13:17,564 --> 00:13:18,630
<i>Ew!</i>

220
00:13:18,632 --> 00:13:20,799
What? Why? <i>I don't know.</i>

221
00:13:20,801 --> 00:13:23,401
I think she thought
she was flirting.

222
00:13:24,471 --> 00:13:27,005
So, how was your date
with "Gotcha"?

223
00:13:27,007 --> 00:13:28,573
Was he wearing a message tee?

224
00:13:28,575 --> 00:13:30,642
Um, he was.

225
00:13:30,644 --> 00:13:32,577
And he quotes movies a lot.

226
00:13:32,579 --> 00:13:34,312
I didn't even get
most of the references.

227
00:13:34,314 --> 00:13:37,282
Like, "I wake up in the morning
and piss excellence."

228
00:13:37,284 --> 00:13:38,850
<i>Talladega Nights.</i>

229
00:13:38,852 --> 00:13:40,418
Oh.

230
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:44,856
Well, I guess we're gonna
end up dying alone like planned.

231
00:13:44,858 --> 00:13:48,526
Um, actually,
he asked me out again,

232
00:13:48,528 --> 00:13:50,762
and I said yes.

233
00:13:50,764 --> 00:13:53,164
<i>I don't know.
I kind of had fun with him.</i>

234
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:55,333
Oh. Cool.

235
00:13:55,335 --> 00:13:57,135
When are you guys
going out again?

236
00:13:57,870 --> 00:13:59,437
Tomorrow.

237
00:14:00,339 --> 00:14:02,307
Which one of us is the lesbian?

238
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:23,328
Fuck.

239
00:14:34,139 --> 00:14:35,373
Oh.

240
00:14:35,375 --> 00:14:37,542
Hey. I didn't see you in there.

241
00:14:37,544 --> 00:14:39,744
You didn't see
my car either, huh?

242
00:14:39,746 --> 00:14:43,081
Well, it was blocking
my driveway, so...

243
00:14:44,316 --> 00:14:47,485
Uh, I wouldn't say
it's blocking your driveway.

244
00:14:47,487 --> 00:14:49,387
It's got
a pretty wide berth here.

245
00:14:49,389 --> 00:14:51,356
Yeah, but you're over the line.

246
00:14:51,358 --> 00:14:53,524
Over the line? Yeah.

247
00:14:53,526 --> 00:14:55,260
This... The line.

248
00:14:56,362 --> 00:14:59,264
Yeah, well, even if I were,
uh, over the line,

249
00:14:59,266 --> 00:15:01,900
I don't think that means
you can just run into my car.

250
00:15:02,835 --> 00:15:04,369
I'm gonna be late for work,

251
00:15:04,371 --> 00:15:07,571
so can we just deal with this
later since we're neighbors?

252
00:15:07,606 --> 00:15:09,674
I should report this
to my insurance today.

253
00:15:09,676 --> 00:15:12,310
I mean, it's a brand-new car.
My wife would kill me.

254
00:15:12,312 --> 00:15:13,978
You're insured, right?

255
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:16,080
Of course I'm insured. Okay.

256
00:15:16,082 --> 00:15:18,282
I really don't see
how this is my fault.

257
00:15:18,784 --> 00:15:20,351
Yeah. Well, you know,

258
00:15:20,353 --> 00:15:23,588
we can just let the insurance
companies deal with all that.

259
00:15:24,156 --> 00:15:25,723
Um...

260
00:15:27,159 --> 00:15:29,994
Whoop. Okay.

261
00:15:29,996 --> 00:15:31,930
Uh, there you go.

262
00:15:31,932 --> 00:15:33,631
Thank you. Mm-hmm.

263
00:15:33,633 --> 00:15:36,534
Um, drive safe. I always do.

264
00:15:56,322 --> 00:15:58,790
You... You got it.

265
00:16:25,051 --> 00:16:27,151
Grossman Properties.

266
00:16:27,153 --> 00:16:28,720
Please hold.

267
00:16:40,299 --> 00:16:42,066
Busy day?

268
00:16:42,068 --> 00:16:44,068
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

269
00:16:44,070 --> 00:16:45,636
Finished everything I had to do,

270
00:16:45,638 --> 00:16:48,006
so I thought
I'd catch up on the news.

271
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:50,575
Hmm.

272
00:16:50,577 --> 00:16:52,477
Will you make sure
this goes out today?

273
00:16:52,479 --> 00:16:54,545
Yeah. Of course.

274
00:16:54,547 --> 00:16:58,950
And maybe you can work on separating the
mail since you're not doing anything else.

275
00:16:58,952 --> 00:17:01,486
Oh, I already did it.
Took like 10 minutes.

276
00:17:01,488 --> 00:17:04,489
Okay, well, in general,
whenever you have downtime...

277
00:17:04,491 --> 00:17:06,624
which I don't remember having
when I had your job...

278
00:17:06,626 --> 00:17:08,760
But since you do,
it might be a good idea...

279
00:17:08,762 --> 00:17:11,262
for you to read something
related to the company.

280
00:17:11,264 --> 00:17:13,698
We just started construction
on five projects this week.

281
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:15,366
Are you familiar
with all of them?

282
00:17:15,368 --> 00:17:17,235
Not yet.

283
00:17:17,237 --> 00:17:20,405
But that's great advice.
Thank you, Valerie.

284
00:17:20,407 --> 00:17:22,874
Great. Okay. Bye.

285
00:17:27,079 --> 00:17:28,346
It didn't...

286
00:17:28,348 --> 00:17:30,648
Oh. I'm sorry. That
didn't buzz you in? No.

287
00:17:30,650 --> 00:17:32,517
Okay. Try again.

288
00:17:32,519 --> 00:17:34,185
Uh...

289
00:17:34,187 --> 00:17:36,287
Did you get it? No. It's still...

290
00:17:36,289 --> 00:17:38,289
One more time.

291
00:17:38,291 --> 00:17:39,957
Ow, I just...

292
00:17:39,959 --> 00:17:42,593
It's been acting up all morning.
I'm sorry.

293
00:17:42,595 --> 00:17:44,162
Got it?

294
00:17:44,164 --> 00:17:46,230
Yeah. Thank you. Okay. Bye.

295
00:17:57,677 --> 00:17:59,310
Hey!

296
00:17:59,312 --> 00:18:02,632
Open up. I gotta
poop in your toilet.

297
00:18:03,982 --> 00:18:05,917
Hi. Oh, my God.

298
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:09,020
Ah, Sasha, I'm Tim.

299
00:18:09,022 --> 00:18:11,255
Hi. Oh, God. Yeah. Hi.

300
00:18:11,257 --> 00:18:12,824
How are you? Mm-hmm.

301
00:18:12,826 --> 00:18:14,392
I'm sorry.
Did Paige not tell you...

302
00:18:14,394 --> 00:18:16,127
that I was crashing
your TV night?

303
00:18:16,129 --> 00:18:18,529
No. It's okay.

304
00:18:18,531 --> 00:18:20,098
Uh... Come on in.

305
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:23,067
I'm sorry that I was so gross
about the bathroom thing before.

306
00:18:23,069 --> 00:18:26,237
I just didn't know anyone
else was here, and I...

307
00:18:26,239 --> 00:18:28,005
Hey, everybody poops. Yeah.

308
00:18:28,007 --> 00:18:29,941
Oh, good. You two met.

309
00:18:29,943 --> 00:18:32,477
I'll go get the wine. Okay.

310
00:18:32,479 --> 00:18:34,445
I'll go help her.
Nice to meet you.

311
00:18:37,015 --> 00:18:38,316
Dude. Hmm?

312
00:18:38,318 --> 00:18:40,151
Why didn't you tell me
Tim was gonna be here?

313
00:18:40,153 --> 00:18:42,086
I didn't know
until like an hour ago.

314
00:18:42,088 --> 00:18:44,822
He called me on his way home from
work, and I thought it'd be real fun.

315
00:18:44,824 --> 00:18:46,390
Well, I wish you
would have warned me...

316
00:18:46,392 --> 00:18:49,393
because then I wouldn't
have... worn pajama pants...

317
00:18:49,395 --> 00:18:50,962
with a hole in the dick.

318
00:18:50,964 --> 00:18:53,464
You're wearing makeup and real clothes.
You look pretty.

319
00:18:53,466 --> 00:18:56,334
The guy is wearing a braided belt.
He's not judging.

320
00:18:56,336 --> 00:18:58,169
And he knows we're
watching<i> Top Model,</i> right?

321
00:18:58,171 --> 00:18:59,871
Yeah. He's never seen it before.

322
00:18:59,873 --> 00:19:02,673
How fun is this gonna be?

323
00:19:02,675 --> 00:19:05,209
<i>My mom was my rock,</i>

324
00:19:05,211 --> 00:19:08,746
<i>and she, you know,
gave me strength.</i>

325
00:19:08,748 --> 00:19:10,515
Wait, now, didn't her
mom abandon her?

326
00:19:10,517 --> 00:19:13,551
Yes, but it's complicated.

327
00:19:13,553 --> 00:19:16,988
<i>I know that...</i>

328
00:19:16,990 --> 00:19:19,824
Okay, now, what does a tea
ceremony have to do with modeling?

329
00:19:19,826 --> 00:19:21,726
Just watch it, and I'll
explain it to you later.

330
00:19:21,728 --> 00:19:25,997
Okay. I'm gonna remember this when
I'm making you watch<i> Lebowski.</i>

331
00:19:26,965 --> 00:19:28,833
You've never seen <i>Big Lebowski?</i>

332
00:19:28,835 --> 00:19:30,401
Thank you.

333
00:19:30,403 --> 00:19:33,304
I've seen the first half of it.
The first half?

334
00:19:33,306 --> 00:19:34,872
It's actually pretty funny.

335
00:19:34,874 --> 00:19:37,675
"Do you see what
happens, Larry?" What?

336
00:19:37,677 --> 00:19:39,410
"Do you see what happens...

337
00:19:39,412 --> 00:19:43,814
when you fuck a
stranger in the ass?"

338
00:19:43,816 --> 00:19:46,150
Oh, right.
That's from the movie.

339
00:19:46,152 --> 00:19:48,586
Okay.

340
00:19:51,456 --> 00:19:53,758
Now, those two
are sisters, right?

341
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:55,493
Um, which two?

342
00:19:55,495 --> 00:19:57,895
That one and the, uh... Wait.
They're not showing her.

343
00:19:57,897 --> 00:19:59,730
Okay, wait. That one and
then that one right there.

344
00:19:59,732 --> 00:20:02,133
Actually, they hate each other
'cause they're both Latinas,

345
00:20:02,135 --> 00:20:05,069
and they know that one Latina's
gonna get eliminated soon.

346
00:20:05,071 --> 00:20:06,704
Ah. I see.

347
00:20:06,706 --> 00:20:09,840
Well, they're both hot. Right, Sasha?
That is your type.

348
00:20:10,576 --> 00:20:12,810
See? <i> Muy caliente.</i>

349
00:20:12,812 --> 00:20:16,080
I told Tim that you went out
with that Cuban girl recently.

350
00:20:16,082 --> 00:20:17,181
Yeah.

351
00:20:17,183 --> 00:20:18,916
Ah.

352
00:20:18,918 --> 00:20:21,819
I mean, I don't... I don't
even remember how it came up.

353
00:20:21,821 --> 00:20:25,289
Yeah, we were talking about people who
were living at home with their parents.

354
00:20:25,291 --> 00:20:27,458
Oh, yeah. And I may have told Tim...
Yeah.

355
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:30,661
That you went out with, like, three
girls recently that live at home.

356
00:20:31,630 --> 00:20:33,197
Oh.

357
00:20:33,199 --> 00:20:35,933
Wow. You told Tim
a lot about me.

358
00:20:35,935 --> 00:20:37,969
I'm sorry. Was that a secret?
Mm-mmm.

359
00:20:37,971 --> 00:20:41,005
It's fine. Totally.

360
00:20:45,677 --> 00:20:49,080
Oh. Sasha. Yeah?

361
00:20:49,082 --> 00:20:52,617
I just wanna make sure
that you can drive home safely.

362
00:20:55,587 --> 00:20:58,356
Oh. I'm sorry.
Is Tim staying over?

363
00:21:02,094 --> 00:21:04,629
Honestly, I don't... I mean,
whatever you wanna do.

364
00:21:04,631 --> 00:21:06,864
I... I... I... I don't...
I'm... I don't wanna...

365
00:21:06,866 --> 00:21:08,933
I don't have to work that early.

366
00:21:08,935 --> 00:21:12,403
Oh. Yeah. I... I don't
wanna assume anything.

367
00:21:21,246 --> 00:21:24,482
Hey. I'm sorry I'm late. I had
to use the copier at work.

368
00:21:24,484 --> 00:21:26,917
I don't think you've ever
stayed late at work.

369
00:21:26,919 --> 00:21:29,720
I didn't do it for the company.
I did it for the copier.

370
00:21:29,722 --> 00:21:31,722
I'm making a little
something for Paige.

371
00:21:31,724 --> 00:21:33,758
She won her first big case
at work today.

372
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:36,060
Oh, yea! Good for her!
That's awesome.

373
00:21:36,062 --> 00:21:39,964
Some factory was dumping sludge near
a school, and she had it shut down.

374
00:21:39,966 --> 00:21:43,267
Oh, fuck that factory. God, Paige
makes me feel like such a bad person.

375
00:21:43,269 --> 00:21:46,237
I know. Isn't she so like
annoying Erin Brockovich?

376
00:21:46,239 --> 00:21:48,706
"These are my boobs, Ed."

377
00:21:48,708 --> 00:21:50,941
That's not the quote. Yes, it is.
I'm pretty sure it is.

378
00:21:50,943 --> 00:21:52,576
I'm pretty sure it's not the quote.
It is so.

379
00:21:52,578 --> 00:21:56,947
Well, anyway, I found a life-size
cardboard Julia Roberts on eBay,

380
00:21:56,949 --> 00:21:58,582
and I'm gonna glue
Paige's face on it...

381
00:21:58,584 --> 00:22:00,551
and throw her a little
surprise party tomorrow. Oh!

382
00:22:00,553 --> 00:22:02,553
Are you guys free? Totally.

383
00:22:02,555 --> 00:22:04,722
Actually, I was supposed
to have a date with this girl...

384
00:22:04,724 --> 00:22:06,657
who's been writing me online
like every single day,

385
00:22:06,659 --> 00:22:10,328
but then she... she just told me she got
back together with her ex-girlfriend,

386
00:22:10,330 --> 00:22:11,896
so that's awesome.

387
00:22:11,898 --> 00:22:14,832
It's like...
Yes, I'm free. I'm free.

388
00:22:15,567 --> 00:22:17,201
Great. Okay.

389
00:22:17,203 --> 00:22:18,969
So, 8:00 at my place?

390
00:22:18,971 --> 00:22:20,538
Hey, Sasha. Mm-hmm.

391
00:22:20,540 --> 00:22:23,474
That chick with the purple dick
is totally checking you out.

392
00:22:23,476 --> 00:22:26,210
You should go sword fight her.

393
00:22:26,212 --> 00:22:30,448
Oh. Uh, I think I need like five
more drinks before I do that.

394
00:22:30,450 --> 00:22:32,750
Jen, I think we have a drink.
Do we not?

395
00:22:32,752 --> 00:22:36,854
- Here you go.
- Here we go. Kick it down. Drink it.

396
00:22:36,856 --> 00:22:39,323
I just found that, by the way.

397
00:22:39,325 --> 00:22:41,559
She didn't, I swear.
Now, go sword fight.

398
00:22:41,561 --> 00:22:43,361
Will you please
stop saying "sword fight"?

399
00:22:43,363 --> 00:22:44,929
Only when you sword fight her.

400
00:22:44,931 --> 00:22:47,198
Sword fight! Sword fight!
Sword fight! All right.

401
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:50,334
If either of you put this on
YouTube, you're dead to me.

402
00:22:50,336 --> 00:22:51,869
I accept this duel.

403
00:22:51,871 --> 00:22:53,804
Yeah! Whoo!

404
00:23:14,292 --> 00:23:17,261
Oh, shit. It's 1:00.

405
00:23:17,263 --> 00:23:19,463
I gotta go walk my dog.

406
00:23:20,499 --> 00:23:22,233
Mmm.

407
00:23:22,235 --> 00:23:24,502
I know that
I was drunk last night,

408
00:23:24,504 --> 00:23:26,937
but I don't remember
seeing a dog.

409
00:23:26,939 --> 00:23:29,673
No. He lives with my ex.

410
00:23:29,675 --> 00:23:32,075
She and I just share custody.

411
00:23:35,081 --> 00:23:37,548
D-Do I hear someone
in your house?

412
00:23:37,550 --> 00:23:39,850
Oh. Yeah. My mom just got home.

413
00:23:39,852 --> 00:23:42,219
- Hi, Mama!
- Hi, sweetheart!

414
00:23:42,221 --> 00:23:44,288
Oh, I thought
this was your house.

415
00:23:44,290 --> 00:23:45,956
I wish.

416
00:23:45,958 --> 00:23:47,958
I'm still in school.

417
00:24:06,312 --> 00:24:07,945
Please tell me
that you are not early,

418
00:24:07,947 --> 00:24:09,713
because I'm so not ready yet.

419
00:24:09,715 --> 00:24:14,685
Actually... Don't kill me, but can
we reschedule <i>Top Model</i> night?

420
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:17,188
<i>Tim just surprised me.</i>

421
00:24:17,190 --> 00:24:19,590
He wants to take me out to dinner
to celebrate me winning the case.

422
00:24:19,592 --> 00:24:21,759
He even sent a car
to pick me up.

423
00:24:22,861 --> 00:24:24,862
Wow. <i> I know.</i>

424
00:24:24,864 --> 00:24:27,932
I'm sure he saw it in a movie, but I
don't even care. How sweet is he?

425
00:24:27,934 --> 00:24:30,634
Yeah, that's really cute.

426
00:24:30,636 --> 00:24:33,370
<i>I know. But I feel so
bad for bailing on you.</i>

427
00:24:33,372 --> 00:24:35,206
No. Oh, my God. No, don't.

428
00:24:35,208 --> 00:24:36,974
That... Don't be silly.

429
00:24:36,976 --> 00:24:39,543
That... That's what DVR is for.

430
00:24:39,545 --> 00:24:41,946
<i>Okay, thank you so much.
I love you.</i>

431
00:24:41,948 --> 00:24:43,514
I love you.

432
00:24:59,865 --> 00:25:01,532
Hey. Hi.

433
00:25:01,534 --> 00:25:04,401
Sorry. How creepy was that
that I sent a car for you...

434
00:25:04,403 --> 00:25:06,070
and I wasn't in it?

435
00:25:06,072 --> 00:25:09,206
I had to work late. Wanted you to be
able to celebrate and not have to drive.

436
00:25:09,208 --> 00:25:10,841
I can't believe you did that.

437
00:25:10,843 --> 00:25:12,510
Oh. Well, thank you.

438
00:25:12,512 --> 00:25:14,845
The place looks amazing.
Oh, yeah. It's cool, right?

439
00:25:14,847 --> 00:25:18,048
I guess they do
this whole local organic thing.

440
00:25:18,050 --> 00:25:19,650
Yeah. Okay. Good.

441
00:25:19,652 --> 00:25:21,485
Yeah, I'll put our names in.

442
00:25:21,487 --> 00:25:23,020
Uh, we have a reservation, but...

443
00:25:23,022 --> 00:25:24,388
What?

444
00:25:24,390 --> 00:25:26,590
Why are you freaking out?

445
00:25:27,893 --> 00:25:29,960
Usually with guys
I have to do everything.

446
00:25:29,962 --> 00:25:33,163
I have to pick the restaurant,
make the reservation,

447
00:25:33,165 --> 00:25:35,533
pick everybody up,
order the wine.

448
00:25:35,535 --> 00:25:38,235
I wonder why those relationships
didn't last. Geez.

449
00:25:39,104 --> 00:25:40,671
Your table's ready.

450
00:25:41,873 --> 00:25:43,941
Okay, thanks. Come on.

451
00:25:47,979 --> 00:25:49,680
Is this too Ellen Page?

452
00:25:49,682 --> 00:25:52,683
No. But it<i> is</i> the boys' section.
Oh.

453
00:25:52,685 --> 00:25:54,919
I wish Tim would wear
stuff like this.

454
00:25:54,921 --> 00:25:56,554
It would look so cute on him.

455
00:25:56,556 --> 00:25:58,789
Oh. Guess he just
likes message tees.

456
00:25:58,791 --> 00:26:00,357
Did I tell you
about his shirt...

457
00:26:00,359 --> 00:26:03,127
that says "Pizza Slut"
in the Pizza Hut logo?

458
00:26:03,129 --> 00:26:05,095
Did you see this?
This is so you.

459
00:26:05,097 --> 00:26:08,332
Oh, it's cute, but can you
really wear a jumper after 30?

460
00:26:08,334 --> 00:26:11,201
What are you talking about?
We're not even 29.

461
00:26:11,203 --> 00:26:13,804
Yeah, but we're
both about to be.

462
00:26:13,806 --> 00:26:16,407
I don't think there's
a cutoff for jumpers, dude.

463
00:26:16,409 --> 00:26:18,642
Okay, I just think
there is for some clothes.

464
00:26:18,644 --> 00:26:22,112
You know when you see an older woman and
she's wearing striped knee socks...

465
00:26:22,114 --> 00:26:25,849
and carrying a backpack
and still dyeing her hair red?

466
00:26:25,851 --> 00:26:29,353
She just seems, like, sad,
like she's a sad person.

467
00:26:29,355 --> 00:26:31,622
Yeah, well, I still don't think
there's a cutoff for jumpers.

468
00:26:31,624 --> 00:26:34,091
Picture a 55-year-old
wearing a jumper.

469
00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:38,162
Okay. I'll give you that.
That is sad.

470
00:26:38,164 --> 00:26:40,264
My cutoff is 54.

471
00:26:47,272 --> 00:26:49,406
I mean...

472
00:26:49,408 --> 00:26:51,208
<i>Where's the money, Lebowski?</i>

473
00:26:51,210 --> 00:26:54,290
So good. <i> I want that
money, Lebowski.</i>

474
00:26:55,046 --> 00:26:56,614
Mmm.

475
00:26:58,617 --> 00:27:01,118
Oh. You don't have to pause it.

476
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:03,387
No, no, no. I don't want
you to miss anything.

477
00:27:03,389 --> 00:27:04,955
Okay.

478
00:27:19,070 --> 00:27:21,805
Oh.

479
00:27:30,782 --> 00:27:31,982
Missed it.

480
00:27:31,984 --> 00:27:34,151
Sasha is with this girl.

481
00:27:34,153 --> 00:27:36,120
Okay. That's... That's...

482
00:27:36,122 --> 00:27:40,224
She's going back to her house.
It's so funny. It's so good.

483
00:27:40,226 --> 00:27:42,259
This chick is really cute.

484
00:27:42,261 --> 00:27:44,128
How do you know?
She sent a picture.

485
00:27:44,130 --> 00:27:46,210
Oh. You wanna see it?

486
00:27:47,766 --> 00:27:49,333
You guys do that a lot.

487
00:27:49,335 --> 00:27:51,201
Is it annoying?

488
00:27:51,203 --> 00:27:54,605
No, but this is, uh,
my favorite movie,

489
00:27:54,607 --> 00:27:57,775
and I did watch the movie about the
blind girl riding horses... for you.

490
00:27:57,777 --> 00:28:01,045
<i>Wild Hearts Can't be Broken</i>
is a classic.

491
00:28:01,047 --> 00:28:03,847
Mm-hmm. Yeah.

492
00:28:03,849 --> 00:28:05,616
Oh. Okay.

493
00:28:05,618 --> 00:28:07,885
I'm sorry.
I'm gonna turn it off, okay?

494
00:28:07,887 --> 00:28:09,620
No, no, no, no. You don't
have to turn it off.

495
00:28:09,622 --> 00:28:12,823
No, no, no, no. No. No. No. I'm
turning it off. I turned it off.

496
00:28:15,460 --> 00:28:17,027
In the drawer. Huh? Fine.

497
00:28:17,029 --> 00:28:19,463
What do you think about that? Fine.
Still not off, but fine.

498
00:28:19,465 --> 00:28:21,331
I... I'll take it. I'll take it.
I'll take it.

499
00:28:21,333 --> 00:28:23,634
- It's in the drawer.
- Shh.

500
00:28:23,636 --> 00:28:27,871
I mean, just because my car technically hit
his car does not mean that it's my fault.

501
00:28:27,873 --> 00:28:31,742
No. He was blocking your driveway.
That's your house.

502
00:28:31,744 --> 00:28:34,178
Yeah, what am I supposed to do,
not leave my home?

503
00:28:34,180 --> 00:28:37,548
Ridiculous. I... I think
you should appeal it.

504
00:28:37,550 --> 00:28:40,617
You're right. I should. It's like a
matter of principle at this point.

505
00:28:40,619 --> 00:28:43,220
Absolutely.
Do not pay that asshole.

506
00:28:43,222 --> 00:28:46,890
You're right. I won't. Fuck that guy.
Fuck him.

507
00:28:46,892 --> 00:28:49,259
I'll have the chicken
salad on the croissant.

508
00:28:49,261 --> 00:28:51,695
Hi. I'll have the ham and Gruyère
on rye, please. Thank you.

509
00:28:51,697 --> 00:28:53,597
Oh, yum. That looks good.

510
00:28:53,599 --> 00:28:56,533
How are things with Tim?
How's that going?

511
00:28:56,535 --> 00:28:59,002
Really good. Couple of
months in, no obvious flaws.

512
00:28:59,004 --> 00:29:01,484
Mmm. I mean, there's
one, but it's dumb.

513
00:29:02,207 --> 00:29:03,774
What is that?

514
00:29:03,776 --> 00:29:05,576
Well, he's not
the sharpest dresser.

515
00:29:05,578 --> 00:29:09,646
I mean, he's not terrible. He's just a
little clueless. Like, he still wears Tevas.

516
00:29:09,648 --> 00:29:11,215
Oh, my God.

517
00:29:11,217 --> 00:29:13,283
Let's stop by Nordstrom's
after this.

518
00:29:13,285 --> 00:29:15,119
They have a great
shoe department.

519
00:29:15,121 --> 00:29:18,088
Mom, it's just "Nordstrom,"
not "Nordstrom's." Oh.

520
00:29:18,090 --> 00:29:20,090
And don't you think
it's, like, a little weird...

521
00:29:20,092 --> 00:29:23,527
to be buying him clothes
this early into a relationship?

522
00:29:23,529 --> 00:29:25,095
No. It's never too early...

523
00:29:25,097 --> 00:29:27,531
to start giving men
fashion advice.

524
00:29:27,533 --> 00:29:29,266
They need it.

525
00:29:29,268 --> 00:29:31,101
We'll go to Nordstrom's.
"Strom."

526
00:29:31,103 --> 00:29:32,770
"Strom."

527
00:29:32,772 --> 00:29:34,738
We'll buy him something nice.

528
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:36,673
And when he wears it,

529
00:29:36,675 --> 00:29:39,576
you have to be sure
to incentivize him...

530
00:29:39,578 --> 00:29:41,979
to keep wearing it.

531
00:29:44,182 --> 00:29:45,883
Oh, my God. That's disgusting.

532
00:29:45,885 --> 00:29:47,451
Well, I'm just saying.

533
00:29:47,453 --> 00:29:50,821
It's how I got your father to stop
wearing those Disney sweatshirts.

534
00:29:50,823 --> 00:29:52,422
Are you paying together
or separate?

535
00:29:52,424 --> 00:29:54,124
Separate.

536
00:29:58,429 --> 00:30:00,230
Oh, my God.
Thank you so much, Mom.

537
00:30:00,232 --> 00:30:02,866
Ohh! I can't believe
I owe so much money.

538
00:30:02,868 --> 00:30:06,403
I-I must have checked the wrong
box or something on the W-2.

539
00:30:06,405 --> 00:30:08,205
<i>Those forms are so confusing.</i>

540
00:30:08,207 --> 00:30:11,508
<i>Don't worry about it, honey. Dad
and I will take care of it online.</i>

541
00:30:11,510 --> 00:30:13,076
Are you sure? <i> Yes.</i>

542
00:30:13,078 --> 00:30:14,711
Oh, my God, I feel so bad.

543
00:30:14,713 --> 00:30:16,880
You guys already help me out
so much with rent and...

544
00:30:16,882 --> 00:30:18,849
<i>Honey, you know,
it's an investment, right?</i>

545
00:30:18,851 --> 00:30:21,752
<i>It's all gonna pay off when
you get that big record deal.</i>

546
00:30:23,522 --> 00:30:26,089
<i>I'll never forget when you won
that prize at graduation.</i>

547
00:30:26,091 --> 00:30:29,626
<i>Your professor told me your daughter's
gonna be the next Patti Smith.</i>

548
00:30:29,628 --> 00:30:33,030
<i>How's the album coming along?</i>
It's good.

549
00:30:33,032 --> 00:30:34,898
Yeah, I was gonna
work on it tonight.

550
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:36,466
<i>Yeah?</i> Yeah.

551
00:30:36,468 --> 00:30:38,602
<i>I can't wait for the day
I'm in a Starbucks...</i>

552
00:30:38,604 --> 00:30:40,304
<i>and see your face
on one of those CDs.</i>

553
00:30:40,306 --> 00:30:44,041
<i>I'll get to tell the clerk, "That's my
daughter, and I'll take a chai latte."</i>

554
00:30:44,043 --> 00:30:48,245
<i>Or maybe you don't want Starbucks to sell
your stuff. Is that too corporate? Right?</i>

555
00:30:48,247 --> 00:30:52,249
No, no, no. No. Gr...
That's... Starbucks is great.

556
00:30:56,521 --> 00:30:58,622
Oh, my God.

557
00:30:58,624 --> 00:31:01,892
You need to do that more.
I'm serious.

558
00:31:01,894 --> 00:31:03,493
I don't know what got into me.

559
00:31:03,495 --> 00:31:05,262
You just looked so hot
in that shirt...

560
00:31:05,264 --> 00:31:07,431
that it brought out
my wild side.

561
00:31:07,433 --> 00:31:10,067
Buy more plaid.

562
00:31:13,004 --> 00:31:15,239
What are you gonna do
this weekend without me?

563
00:31:15,241 --> 00:31:17,708
Um, I'm gonna cry.

564
00:31:17,710 --> 00:31:20,244
Duh. Then I'm gonna
visit my dad.

565
00:31:20,246 --> 00:31:22,012
Oh. That's sweet.

566
00:31:22,014 --> 00:31:23,881
I wanna meet him.

567
00:31:23,883 --> 00:31:27,083
You'll meet him. I'm gonna throw
him a party for his 80th.

568
00:31:28,187 --> 00:31:30,487
I'm sorry. No, it's okay.

569
00:31:30,489 --> 00:31:32,756
My dad's fucking old.
It's funny.

570
00:31:32,758 --> 00:31:35,626
He was a, uh, dirty old man
who slept with his secretary.

571
00:31:35,628 --> 00:31:38,228
My mom's a slutty secretary
who slept with her boss.

572
00:31:38,230 --> 00:31:39,830
It's totally funny.

573
00:31:41,866 --> 00:31:44,501
It must be hard
taking care of your dad.

574
00:31:44,503 --> 00:31:46,370
Hmm? I don't know.

575
00:31:46,372 --> 00:31:49,973
I mean, we all end up taking care of
our parents at some point, right?

576
00:31:49,975 --> 00:31:52,042
I just got a head start. Hmm.

577
00:31:52,044 --> 00:31:56,880
I feel like my mom is trying to train
me to start taking care of her.

578
00:31:56,882 --> 00:31:58,515
Mm-hmm.

579
00:31:58,517 --> 00:32:03,353
She used to pay every time we went out
to eat, and then she just stopped.

580
00:32:03,355 --> 00:32:06,223
Mm-hmm. It's not like I can't
afford a $10 sandwich.

581
00:32:06,225 --> 00:32:08,058
But it just feels
like she's saying...

582
00:32:08,060 --> 00:32:09,793
"I'm done with this mom shit"?
Yeah.

583
00:32:09,795 --> 00:32:11,561
Yeah. It's sad.

584
00:32:11,563 --> 00:32:15,232
Hmm. I feel like no one's
taking care of me anymore.

585
00:32:15,234 --> 00:32:17,367
Aw.

586
00:32:17,369 --> 00:32:19,503
Other people can
take care of you.

587
00:32:19,505 --> 00:32:22,906
Oh, it's Sasha.

588
00:32:22,908 --> 00:32:24,875
No. I don't wanna go.

589
00:32:24,877 --> 00:32:26,143
No.

590
00:32:26,145 --> 00:32:28,745
Okay, I have to go. She's
gonna be so mad at me.

591
00:32:28,747 --> 00:32:32,182
No.

592
00:32:32,184 --> 00:32:35,585
Okay. Do I look like
I just had sex?

593
00:32:35,587 --> 00:32:37,754
All right.

594
00:32:39,023 --> 00:32:41,825
I will call you when I get to the hotel.
I love you.

595
00:32:42,827 --> 00:32:44,394
I mean...

596
00:32:45,430 --> 00:32:46,997
I knew it.

597
00:32:47,765 --> 00:32:49,299
I knew you loved me.

598
00:32:49,301 --> 00:32:51,735
I didn't mean for it to come out like that.
I knew you loved me.

599
00:32:51,737 --> 00:32:53,303
So you didn't mean it? No.

600
00:32:53,305 --> 00:32:54,838
So you love me? I...

601
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:57,007
So you don't love me?
You love me.

602
00:32:57,009 --> 00:32:58,642
You love me. I meant...

603
00:32:58,644 --> 00:33:01,912
You love me. I... You love<i> me.</i>

604
00:33:01,914 --> 00:33:05,394
I don't know. Give me a kiss.
Let me see.

605
00:33:08,052 --> 00:33:09,619
I love you.

606
00:33:09,621 --> 00:33:11,188
No. I do.

607
00:33:11,190 --> 00:33:13,323
All right. Yeah.

608
00:33:15,059 --> 00:33:18,028
What time is it?
I feel like the pool closes at 10:00.

609
00:33:18,030 --> 00:33:20,731
Oh, my God. I don't think
anyone's enforcing that.

610
00:33:20,733 --> 00:33:22,799
This place doesn't
even have a staff.

611
00:33:22,801 --> 00:33:26,703
God, I could have taken you to a
nicer place for your birthday.

612
00:33:26,705 --> 00:33:29,773
What? Are you crazy?
This is perfect.

613
00:33:29,775 --> 00:33:31,808
I love how it's
right off the freeway.

614
00:33:31,810 --> 00:33:34,044
No, I'm serious. Every time
I drive by this place,

615
00:33:34,046 --> 00:33:35,612
I wonder who
the fuck stays here.

616
00:33:35,614 --> 00:33:37,647
Well, now we know.
Truckers and us.

617
00:33:39,283 --> 00:33:42,085
I can't believe this is my
last birthday in my 20s.

618
00:33:42,087 --> 00:33:43,687
We were just 25.

619
00:33:43,689 --> 00:33:45,689
I know. It's crazy.

620
00:33:48,159 --> 00:33:50,794
I'm a 29-year-old receptionist.

621
00:33:50,796 --> 00:33:53,196
But you're not
a real receptionist.

622
00:33:53,198 --> 00:33:56,033
You're a musician. I know.

623
00:33:56,035 --> 00:33:58,769
But being a receptionist
is the only thing...

624
00:33:58,771 --> 00:34:00,704
that anyone's paying me
to do right now.

625
00:34:00,706 --> 00:34:02,773
Like...

626
00:34:02,775 --> 00:34:04,941
I don't know.
If I died tomorrow,

627
00:34:04,943 --> 00:34:06,510
my obituary would say,

628
00:34:06,512 --> 00:34:10,280
"Sasha Weiss, 29, a receptionist,
was killed today."

629
00:34:11,616 --> 00:34:14,251
Why would you be killed?
Because... I don't know. I'm 29.

630
00:34:14,253 --> 00:34:17,653
Something really fucking
sudden must have happened.

631
00:34:18,056 --> 00:34:20,991
God, I've been
feeling old lately too.

632
00:34:20,993 --> 00:34:23,126
I feel like there are certain
things I can't do anymore,

633
00:34:23,128 --> 00:34:25,362
like sit on the floor
at airports.

634
00:34:25,364 --> 00:34:28,131
I still do that.
Oh, I still do it.

635
00:34:28,133 --> 00:34:29,733
I just feel like
everybody's looking at me...

636
00:34:29,735 --> 00:34:32,702
like, "That woman is too old
to be sitting on the floor."

637
00:34:32,704 --> 00:34:35,505
Yeah. Growing up sucks.

638
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:37,808
No, it doesn't.

639
00:34:37,810 --> 00:34:40,911
What? Don't you wish you were 21?
God, no.

640
00:34:40,913 --> 00:34:42,579
I was so insecure.

641
00:34:43,614 --> 00:34:45,682
But...

642
00:34:45,684 --> 00:34:49,786
when you're 21,
it's... just easier.

643
00:34:50,788 --> 00:34:52,789
Right?

644
00:34:52,791 --> 00:34:55,525
It's okay to be
a receptionist...

645
00:34:55,527 --> 00:34:58,628
and eat like shit and just
date people for fun...

646
00:34:58,630 --> 00:35:00,630
and sit on the floor.

647
00:35:03,334 --> 00:35:06,837
And remember, you and I used
to hang out all the time.

648
00:35:06,839 --> 00:35:10,474
And we'd make stupid videos that
no one thought was funny but us.

649
00:35:11,843 --> 00:35:13,410
Sasha.

650
00:35:14,512 --> 00:35:16,646
Sasha, what's wrong? Nothing.

651
00:35:16,648 --> 00:35:18,248
Ignore me. No.

652
00:35:18,250 --> 00:35:20,317
Don't. No. Please, tell me.

653
00:35:20,319 --> 00:35:22,052
Nothing. I just...

654
00:35:24,856 --> 00:35:26,790
I miss that sometimes.

655
00:35:28,459 --> 00:35:30,360
But what's changed?

656
00:35:30,362 --> 00:35:31,928
I'm still here.

657
00:35:31,930 --> 00:35:34,498
I'm not going anywhere.

658
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:37,601
We're still the only ones
who think we're funny.

659
00:35:37,603 --> 00:35:40,170
Shut up.

660
00:35:40,172 --> 00:35:42,139
Shh. Come here.

661
00:35:42,141 --> 00:35:45,675
I love you. I love<i> you.</i>

662
00:35:47,245 --> 00:35:50,046
Oh, my God. You're a genius.

663
00:35:50,048 --> 00:35:52,582
Oh! Yes.

664
00:35:52,584 --> 00:35:56,086
Fitz stickers. I knew you'd
love it, you fucking loser.

665
00:35:56,088 --> 00:35:57,754
We're playing right now.

666
00:35:57,756 --> 00:36:00,190
Duh. Do you know how long I've
been looking forward to this trip?

667
00:36:00,192 --> 00:36:02,659
Oh, really? Yes.

668
00:36:02,661 --> 00:36:04,961
Do you think Tim would
play Girl Talk with me?

669
00:36:04,963 --> 00:36:07,564
He can't even be in the room
when I watch<i> Real Housewives.</i>

670
00:36:07,566 --> 00:36:09,599
I know.

671
00:36:09,601 --> 00:36:11,968
I have to binge on this
shit when I'm with you.

672
00:36:11,970 --> 00:36:14,004
Oh, my God.
I can't believe I forgot.

673
00:36:14,006 --> 00:36:15,572
I brought pink wine.

674
00:36:15,574 --> 00:36:17,140
No! I did.

675
00:36:17,142 --> 00:36:20,810
Oh, my God.
Do we have a wine opener?

676
00:36:20,812 --> 00:36:24,147
Uh, no, darling.
It's a twist-off.

677
00:36:24,982 --> 00:36:26,550
Mmm.

678
00:36:26,552 --> 00:36:29,452
Oh, my God. Girl Talk.
Drunk Girl Talk.

679
00:36:29,454 --> 00:36:31,688
Drunk Talk. Mm!

680
00:36:31,690 --> 00:36:33,570
Girl Drunk. It's so bad.

681
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:36,927
Tim's calling you.

682
00:36:36,929 --> 00:36:39,863
Ew! How dare you call me
during Sasha's birthday.

683
00:36:39,865 --> 00:36:41,364
Ignore you.

684
00:36:44,502 --> 00:36:46,136
Oh.

685
00:36:46,138 --> 00:36:49,773
"Go find a clue
to your future career choice."

686
00:36:53,312 --> 00:36:55,845
"On the sixth page
of the Yellow Pages."

687
00:36:57,181 --> 00:36:58,415
What?

688
00:36:58,417 --> 00:37:01,384
A pipe burst at Tim's
dad's retirement home.

689
00:37:01,386 --> 00:37:03,787
He has to take him to a hotel.

690
00:37:05,256 --> 00:37:07,390
I really feel like
I should call him.

691
00:37:07,392 --> 00:37:09,859
Yeah. Call him.

692
00:37:09,861 --> 00:37:13,063
It's okay. Go. Go. Call him.

693
00:37:13,065 --> 00:37:14,831
I'm so sorry. It's okay.

694
00:38:49,061 --> 00:38:51,961
<i>Long day for investors
on Wall Street.</i>

695
00:38:51,963 --> 00:38:54,964
<i>The Dow Jones Industrial Average
fell one and a half percent.</i>

696
00:38:57,068 --> 00:39:00,370
Hey! I was gonna take that spot.

697
00:39:01,505 --> 00:39:04,441
I didn't see the name
"Bitch" written on it.

698
00:39:04,443 --> 00:39:06,343
Get out of there! No!

699
00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:17,279
Ugh. Seriously.

700
00:39:18,489 --> 00:39:21,224
Okay, so you know that girl I told
you about? I met her last week.

701
00:39:21,226 --> 00:39:23,360
And she's the one whose roommate
might or might not be her ex.

702
00:39:23,362 --> 00:39:24,762
Yeah. Who knows?

703
00:39:24,763 --> 00:39:27,430
Okay, well, I texted her
as soon as I met her...

704
00:39:27,432 --> 00:39:28,998
and then never heard back.

705
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,900
And then I just got
a text just now...

706
00:39:30,902 --> 00:39:32,702
saying,
"See you tonight at 8:00."

707
00:39:32,704 --> 00:39:36,373
Is she texting the wrong person, or am I
supposed to be at some event at 8:00?

708
00:39:36,375 --> 00:39:38,108
I don't know. Ask her.

709
00:39:38,110 --> 00:39:40,110
Well, no, I can't ask her.

710
00:39:40,112 --> 00:39:42,178
Because what if she texted
the wrong person?

711
00:39:42,180 --> 00:39:44,080
And then I'm just asking
if she's inviting me out,

712
00:39:44,082 --> 00:39:47,550
and then she's gonna have to re-blow
me off. Then don't text her.

713
00:39:47,552 --> 00:39:50,487
No, but if she did
mean to text me...

714
00:39:50,489 --> 00:39:53,156
and if she was just playing
it cool this whole week...

715
00:39:53,158 --> 00:39:56,126
and then she's expecting to see
me and then I don't show up,

716
00:39:56,128 --> 00:39:59,362
then I'm blowing<i> her</i> off.
I don't know, Sasha.

717
00:40:00,731 --> 00:40:02,298
Oh.

718
00:40:02,300 --> 00:40:05,402
I'm sorry. Too mature for this
now that you have a boyfriend...

719
00:40:05,404 --> 00:40:08,271
and you spend the whole weekend
roasting a chicken together?

720
00:40:09,206 --> 00:40:10,774
How do you know that?

721
00:40:10,776 --> 00:40:12,776
You posted it on Instagram.

722
00:40:12,778 --> 00:40:14,544
I'm just giving you shit.

723
00:40:15,679 --> 00:40:17,347
Let me see that text. No.

724
00:40:17,349 --> 00:40:19,416
No, no, show it to me.
I wanna know. No.

725
00:40:19,418 --> 00:40:21,484
Well, maybe if I see it, I can
figure out what she meant.

726
00:40:21,486 --> 00:40:23,820
It's fine. It's totally fine.

727
00:40:35,199 --> 00:40:36,766
All right.

728
00:40:37,935 --> 00:40:39,769
I mean... What?

729
00:40:39,771 --> 00:40:42,211
That's how it's supposed to look.
Okay.

730
00:40:51,649 --> 00:40:53,716
What are you thinking about?

731
00:40:55,085 --> 00:40:56,653
Nothing.

732
00:40:56,655 --> 00:40:58,221
What is it?

733
00:41:03,694 --> 00:41:06,174
All right, I gotta talk
to you about something.

734
00:41:08,632 --> 00:41:10,366
Don't freak out.

735
00:41:10,368 --> 00:41:12,802
But...

736
00:41:12,804 --> 00:41:15,371
I found something
on my back the other day.

737
00:41:15,373 --> 00:41:17,907
What, like a mole? Yeah.

738
00:41:17,909 --> 00:41:20,310
But...
But you're a dermatologist.

739
00:41:20,312 --> 00:41:22,479
I... Yeah, well,

740
00:41:22,481 --> 00:41:25,181
dermatologists can
also get skin cancer.

741
00:41:25,183 --> 00:41:27,317
You have cancer? No, no, no.
I don't know that.

742
00:41:27,319 --> 00:41:30,320
I don't know that. I'm waiting
on some results. I just want...

743
00:41:30,322 --> 00:41:31,888
Show me.

744
00:41:33,190 --> 00:41:35,024
I don't... It's gross.
I don't want...

745
00:41:35,026 --> 00:41:36,593
Tim. It's gross. I
don't wanna show you.

746
00:41:36,595 --> 00:41:38,595
I don't care. Whatever.
Tim, show me the mole.

747
00:41:38,597 --> 00:41:40,563
Come on. Show it to me. Tim.
I don't wanna show you.

748
00:41:40,565 --> 00:41:42,645
All right. It's near the top.

749
00:41:47,972 --> 00:41:50,507
Should I be worried?

750
00:41:50,509 --> 00:41:52,175
Yes.

751
00:41:53,377 --> 00:41:55,111
I mean no.

752
00:41:56,247 --> 00:41:57,981
I mean...

753
00:41:58,849 --> 00:42:01,084
Yes, I'll marry you. Really?

754
00:42:01,086 --> 00:42:02,919
Yes. Oh!

755
00:42:03,654 --> 00:42:05,421
Oh. Oh, my God.

756
00:42:05,423 --> 00:42:07,724
How could you do that to me?
You fucking asshole.

757
00:42:07,726 --> 00:42:09,926
I wanted us to have a good story.
Don't you want a good story?

758
00:42:09,928 --> 00:42:11,494
Fuck you.

759
00:42:11,496 --> 00:42:13,596
Who wrote that on your back?
Dr. Schaffer.

760
00:42:13,598 --> 00:42:16,366
With his little lady hands?
Those are the ones. Mmm.

761
00:42:16,368 --> 00:42:19,002
Oh, my God.

762
00:42:19,004 --> 00:42:20,803
Tim.

763
00:42:20,805 --> 00:42:22,405
Now that you've said yes...
Mm-hmm.

764
00:42:22,407 --> 00:42:25,675
Let me tell you, you did such
a shitty job with that tent.

765
00:42:43,661 --> 00:42:45,228
Hey!

766
00:42:45,230 --> 00:42:47,550
You wanna hear
something fucked-up?

767
00:42:48,098 --> 00:42:50,066
Yeah. Okay. Sure.

768
00:42:50,068 --> 00:42:53,102
They did peer reviews at my work today.
Everyone hates me.

769
00:42:53,104 --> 00:42:54,771
Listen to this.

770
00:42:54,773 --> 00:42:57,707
"Sasha is bright and skilled"...
That sounds like a compliment.

771
00:42:57,709 --> 00:43:02,645
"But this ability does not seem to be focused
on her work here at Grossman Properties."

772
00:43:02,647 --> 00:43:04,881
I bet you anything
Valerie wrote that.

773
00:43:04,883 --> 00:43:06,482
That bitch is always
walking by my desk...

774
00:43:06,484 --> 00:43:08,084
asking if I'm
"having a busy day"...

775
00:43:08,086 --> 00:43:10,820
when it's obvious she doesn't think
that I look busy, 'cause I'm not.

776
00:43:10,822 --> 00:43:12,889
Okay, don't focus
on who wrote what. Just...

777
00:43:12,891 --> 00:43:15,158
Are you crazy? I have
to know who wrote what.

778
00:43:15,160 --> 00:43:17,026
Like, who the fuck wrote this?

779
00:43:17,028 --> 00:43:20,463
"Sasha can come across as irritated
when asked to do something."

780
00:43:20,465 --> 00:43:22,031
Who are you?

781
00:43:22,033 --> 00:43:25,001
Can I get a vodka soda with a
splash of cranberry, please?

782
00:43:25,003 --> 00:43:27,637
You need to remember
that this is just your day job.

783
00:43:27,639 --> 00:43:30,239
I know that it sucks and it's boring,
but this is what you wanted.

784
00:43:30,241 --> 00:43:32,942
You wanted something easy and mindless
that you didn't have to think about...

785
00:43:32,944 --> 00:43:35,478
so you could focus
on your music every night.

786
00:43:35,480 --> 00:43:37,246
Yeah. No.

787
00:43:37,248 --> 00:43:39,816
I know you're right.

788
00:43:42,721 --> 00:43:44,287
How was your camping trip?

789
00:43:44,289 --> 00:43:46,990
Uh, it... it was really good.

790
00:43:46,992 --> 00:43:49,158
It was... great, actually.

791
00:43:49,160 --> 00:43:52,161
Uh, Tim and I got engaged.

792
00:43:53,464 --> 00:43:56,065
Wait. What? Yeah.

793
00:43:57,501 --> 00:43:59,068
Paige!

794
00:43:59,070 --> 00:44:00,870
Oh, my God.

795
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:04,974
Oh, my God.

796
00:44:06,176 --> 00:44:08,811
Wow.

797
00:44:08,813 --> 00:44:10,580
I know.

798
00:44:10,582 --> 00:44:12,382
Can you believe it?

799
00:44:12,384 --> 00:44:14,050
Well, cheers. Wedding.

800
00:44:14,052 --> 00:44:16,919
Yeah! Oh, my God! I know.
It's so crazy, right?

801
00:44:16,921 --> 00:44:19,555
I'm gonna be your best man.
You...

802
00:45:24,354 --> 00:45:26,589
So, you come here often?

803
00:45:26,591 --> 00:45:28,157
Mm. Yeah.

804
00:45:28,159 --> 00:45:31,127
Me and the mozzarella sticks
have a little thing going on.

805
00:45:31,129 --> 00:45:34,630
Well, I hate to break it to you, but
they're kind of seeing somebody else.

806
00:45:34,632 --> 00:45:37,967
I feel so betrayed. We didn't
want you to find out like this.

807
00:45:41,572 --> 00:45:43,973
One time I had
two orders of these.

808
00:45:43,975 --> 00:45:45,842
In one night. Oh.

809
00:45:45,844 --> 00:45:49,245
No, I had one in the parking lot
and then I drove through again.

810
00:45:49,247 --> 00:45:51,080
I'd be too embarrassed.

811
00:45:51,082 --> 00:45:54,884
Yeah, I couldn't really bring myself to make
eye contact with the girl at the window.

812
00:46:06,930 --> 00:46:10,032
What band is this? Oh, this
is my friend Kaya's band.

813
00:46:10,034 --> 00:46:11,601
They're amazing.

814
00:46:11,603 --> 00:46:14,337
I'll bring you a copy. Okay.

815
00:46:14,339 --> 00:46:17,607
I'm actually playing
the drums on the CD.

816
00:46:17,609 --> 00:46:20,777
Oh, no way.
Wow. I didn't know you played.

817
00:46:20,779 --> 00:46:23,846
I am a musician too. Oh.

818
00:46:23,848 --> 00:46:25,915
Well, I'm not really a musician.

819
00:46:25,917 --> 00:46:29,085
I'm mostly a writer, and I've
been drawing a lot lately.

820
00:46:29,087 --> 00:46:31,687
I'm actually working
on a graphic novel.

821
00:46:31,689 --> 00:46:32,989
Mmm!

822
00:46:33,824 --> 00:46:35,958
So are you, like, in a band?

823
00:46:35,960 --> 00:46:41,898
No, not right now. I'm just... working
on writing some songs of my own first.

824
00:46:41,900 --> 00:46:45,368
Nice. I hate it when bands go on
tour with, like, three songs.

825
00:46:45,370 --> 00:46:46,702
Mmm.

826
00:46:46,704 --> 00:46:49,305
Well, it is nice to meet
a fellow artist.

827
00:46:49,307 --> 00:46:51,774
Yeah. I know. You too.

828
00:46:51,776 --> 00:46:54,844
I had no idea.
Jenn never mentioned anything.

829
00:46:54,846 --> 00:46:58,247
Well, Jenn doesn't know
everything about me.

830
00:46:58,249 --> 00:47:00,289
We didn't really date
for that long.

831
00:47:11,295 --> 00:47:12,395
Whoo!

832
00:47:13,664 --> 00:47:15,565
Hey, Sasha.

833
00:47:15,567 --> 00:47:16,966
Ow!

834
00:47:16,968 --> 00:47:19,368
You bitch. That hurt.
Better be careful.

835
00:47:19,370 --> 00:47:22,371
It's your turn.
We're paying by the hour.

836
00:47:22,373 --> 00:47:24,006
Hey.

837
00:47:38,021 --> 00:47:41,357
That's a really interesting tattoo
that you have. What does it mean?

838
00:47:41,359 --> 00:47:43,593
I don't really
like to talk about it.

839
00:47:43,595 --> 00:47:47,897
Oh. I just figured,
since it was on your neck...

840
00:47:47,899 --> 00:47:51,100
Uh, so, how long have you and
Sasha been seeing each other?

841
00:47:51,102 --> 00:47:54,136
Well, technically three weeks,
but don't tell anyone that.

842
00:47:54,138 --> 00:47:55,905
We don't want anyone
to know yet.

843
00:47:55,907 --> 00:47:59,842
Uh, why?
Uh, just dumb lesbian drama.

844
00:47:59,844 --> 00:48:01,410
Jenn two N's dated Vanessa.

845
00:48:01,412 --> 00:48:05,481
- For, like, a second.
- Yeah, but she would freak out anyway.

846
00:48:05,483 --> 00:48:08,484
But we have a plan. I just
deleted Sasha on Facebook.

847
00:48:08,486 --> 00:48:11,220
Yeah, we're gonna pretend like we don't
really know each other right now.

848
00:48:11,222 --> 00:48:13,222
And then right when we're
ready to tell people,

849
00:48:13,224 --> 00:48:15,758
we're gonna add each other back and
comment on each other's pages like,

850
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:18,594
oh, we just ran into each other.
I gotcha.

851
00:48:27,170 --> 00:48:29,639
There are some nice houses
around here though.

852
00:48:29,641 --> 00:48:32,275
Yeah, but I don't know. Do you think
the neighborhood's too sketchy?

853
00:48:32,277 --> 00:48:34,977
You think this neighborhood
is sketchy?

854
00:48:34,979 --> 00:48:36,979
Well...

855
00:48:36,981 --> 00:48:39,882
I mean, yeah. There's, like, three
metal detectors in this bowling alley.

856
00:48:40,550 --> 00:48:42,151
That's just the future.

857
00:48:42,786 --> 00:48:44,687
Well, yeah, probably.

858
00:48:44,689 --> 00:48:47,056
Yeah. The schools aren't very
good around here either.

859
00:48:47,058 --> 00:48:49,725
Oh, "the schools."

860
00:48:49,727 --> 00:48:51,794
Just thinking ahead.

861
00:48:51,796 --> 00:48:55,097
Well, whatever you decide, don't
send your kids to private school,

862
00:48:55,099 --> 00:48:58,000
unless you want them to grow up
with a silver spoon up their ass.

863
00:48:58,002 --> 00:49:00,069
Well, what if you live in a
really dangerous neighborhood?

864
00:49:00,071 --> 00:49:02,371
I don't care. I'd still
rather send my kids...

865
00:49:02,373 --> 00:49:04,974
to a public school in the
ghetto than a private school.

866
00:49:04,976 --> 00:49:08,544
All kids that go to private school
turn into conservative douche bags.

867
00:49:08,546 --> 00:49:10,546
Tim went to private school.

868
00:49:11,214 --> 00:49:12,548
I did.

869
00:49:12,550 --> 00:49:15,851
We gotta go.
My dad's locking the gate.

870
00:49:15,853 --> 00:49:17,853
Oh.

871
00:49:17,855 --> 00:49:22,558
Oh, she just had to move back home for a few
months before art school. It's temporary.

872
00:49:24,361 --> 00:49:25,928
Bye.

873
00:49:27,331 --> 00:49:29,332
What the fuck is wrong
with that girl? I'm sorry.

874
00:49:29,334 --> 00:49:32,234
I know you like everyone, and you think
that I'm really judgy, but can you please...

875
00:49:32,236 --> 00:49:34,036
I hated Vanessa. Thank you.

876
00:49:34,038 --> 00:49:36,605
I'm so sick of Sasha wasting
her time with these idiots.

877
00:49:36,607 --> 00:49:38,341
When is she gonna date
an actual adult?

878
00:49:38,343 --> 00:49:41,377
Is everyone she dates that immature?
Vanessa's on the mature side.

879
00:49:41,379 --> 00:49:43,479
Gotcha.
Can you not say "gotcha"?

880
00:49:43,481 --> 00:49:46,215
I'm sorry. It's a pet peeve of mine.
You kind of say it a lot.

881
00:49:46,217 --> 00:49:50,319
Oh. Okay. Sure. Sorry. What am I gonna say
when she asks me what I thought of her?

882
00:49:50,321 --> 00:49:52,488
Uh, just tell her you thought
she was a fucking bitch.

883
00:49:52,490 --> 00:49:54,090
Ha-ha. And, you know...

884
00:49:54,092 --> 00:49:56,559
What am I gonna say? "I really
liked her neck tattoo."

885
00:49:56,561 --> 00:49:59,295
You know, don't say anything. I don't
know why you have to get involved.

886
00:49:59,297 --> 00:50:03,499
Just say you're glad she's happy, wait for it
to burn out. Which it most definitely will.

887
00:50:03,501 --> 00:50:06,302
It has to, right? Yes. It will.
So stay out of it.

888
00:50:06,304 --> 00:50:09,472
Yeah, I will. Oh, God, I just want
to sit Sasha down and be like,

889
00:50:09,474 --> 00:50:13,209
"The truth hurts, but as your best
friend, get your life together!"

890
00:50:13,211 --> 00:50:16,579
You know, you have to stop going out all
night and dating girls like this...

891
00:50:16,581 --> 00:50:18,781
and figure out what you
want to do with your life,

892
00:50:18,783 --> 00:50:21,250
because you're gonna wake up one
day, and you're gonna be 35,

893
00:50:21,252 --> 00:50:23,719
and you're gonna have no relationship,
you're gonna have no savings,

894
00:50:23,721 --> 00:50:26,589
all of your friends are gonna be married
with kids and be miles ahead of you,

895
00:50:26,591 --> 00:50:29,825
"and it's gonna feel like shit, and
I'm sorry, but that's the reality."

896
00:50:29,827 --> 00:50:32,361
Yeah. That's not
staying out of it.

897
00:50:32,363 --> 00:50:35,631
Well, obviously I'm not gonna
say any of that to her.

898
00:50:35,633 --> 00:50:38,034
You two are
a really cute couple.

899
00:50:38,036 --> 00:50:44,440
Vanessa seems, like, really confident
and, like, very sure of herself.

900
00:50:45,409 --> 00:50:47,209
Yeah, I like her a lot.

901
00:50:47,211 --> 00:50:50,579
That's great.
I'm so happy for you.

902
00:50:50,581 --> 00:50:52,815
So, do you think
it's gonna be serious?

903
00:50:52,817 --> 00:50:55,151
Could you, like, see yourself
ending up with Vanessa?

904
00:50:55,153 --> 00:51:00,222
I don't know. I mean, it's
going really well. Yeah. So...

905
00:51:00,224 --> 00:51:03,259
I mean, I know you don't know
her, but she's really cool.

906
00:51:03,261 --> 00:51:04,960
Oh, I'm sure she is.

907
00:51:06,963 --> 00:51:11,600
But, you know, you guys might be, like, just
too different to really get each other.

908
00:51:12,269 --> 00:51:13,969
What does that mean?

909
00:51:13,971 --> 00:51:16,939
I don't know. Sometimes just
really super creative types...

910
00:51:16,941 --> 00:51:21,710
don't really mesh that well with people
who are more, you know, traditional.

911
00:51:21,712 --> 00:51:24,914
I'm traditional?
No. No, no, no, no, no.

912
00:51:24,916 --> 00:51:27,550
You're just more,
you know, organized.

913
00:51:27,552 --> 00:51:30,719
Vanessa is like
a total free spirit.

914
00:51:30,721 --> 00:51:33,255
You know? Sometimes I'll wake
up in the middle of the night,

915
00:51:33,257 --> 00:51:35,191
and she's up writing down
a dream she just had.

916
00:51:35,193 --> 00:51:37,860
And I've read a few of them.
Oh, my God.

917
00:51:37,862 --> 00:51:41,363
Like, it's incredible.
They're complete stories.

918
00:51:41,365 --> 00:51:44,867
Like, that's just how her brain works.
She dreams in stories.

919
00:51:44,869 --> 00:51:48,771
So, does Vanessa want to be
a writer, like for work?

920
00:51:48,773 --> 00:51:51,006
'Cause she doesn't have
a job right now, right?

921
00:51:51,008 --> 00:51:54,110
Yeah, she's just taking some time to
figure out what she really wants to do,

922
00:51:54,112 --> 00:51:56,645
which I respect a lot more
than some people...

923
00:51:56,647 --> 00:52:01,183
who just pick some path right out of
school because they need stability.

924
00:52:03,353 --> 00:52:07,189
Oh, do you need to slow down?
No. Do you?

925
00:52:07,191 --> 00:52:08,524
No.

926
00:52:08,526 --> 00:52:09,959
I'm fine. I'm good too.

927
00:52:09,961 --> 00:52:12,061
Good. Good.

928
00:52:24,307 --> 00:52:26,242
Hey. Hey, hey, hey.

929
00:52:26,244 --> 00:52:27,576
Hey.

930
00:52:27,578 --> 00:52:30,079
Why can't you just
pay for the damage?

931
00:52:30,081 --> 00:52:32,181
You were parked in our driveway.

932
00:52:32,183 --> 00:52:34,150
You hit my car. You hit my...

933
00:52:34,152 --> 00:52:37,186
- Okay, let's just... Let's calm down a second.
- It's okay, Tim. I got it.

934
00:52:37,188 --> 00:52:40,356
You know what? The insurance companies are still
trying to determine who was at fault here.

935
00:52:40,358 --> 00:52:45,060
Okay, you know what? I'm a nice guy, okay?
I'm a fucking dad.

936
00:52:45,062 --> 00:52:48,831
I'm not... I'm not trying to rip you
off here. I just want what's right.

937
00:52:48,833 --> 00:52:52,101
I'm sorry that you feel
wronged in this situation.

938
00:52:52,103 --> 00:52:55,804
Okay, you're unbelievable. Don't run over my
kids next time you're texting and driving.

939
00:52:55,806 --> 00:52:58,340
I do not text and drive.
Seriously?

940
00:52:58,342 --> 00:53:01,577
Dude, she does it all the time.
I see her.

941
00:53:01,579 --> 00:53:04,413
You... Da-da-da-da-da,
da-da-da-da-da. You.

942
00:53:04,415 --> 00:53:06,148
Jesus.

943
00:53:07,317 --> 00:53:10,085
Maybe I was entering
something into my G.P.S.

944
00:53:10,087 --> 00:53:11,654
Maybe.

945
00:53:13,089 --> 00:53:14,256
Wait...

946
00:53:15,525 --> 00:53:17,193
Hey. What's up?

947
00:53:17,195 --> 00:53:19,228
Maybe we should just pay him.
What?

948
00:53:19,230 --> 00:53:21,463
Well, we don't need to be in a
fight with our neighbor over this.

949
00:53:21,465 --> 00:53:24,833
Maybe we just give him a couple hundred bucks,
you say you're sorry, we'll be done with it.

950
00:53:24,835 --> 00:53:27,703
But I didn't do anything wrong.
I'm not saying you did.

951
00:53:27,705 --> 00:53:30,806
I mean, although you're not really supposed
to use the G.P.S. while you're driving.

952
00:53:30,808 --> 00:53:32,775
Oh, so you do think
it's my fault.

953
00:53:32,777 --> 00:53:34,810
I don't know whose fault it was.
I wasn't there.

954
00:53:34,812 --> 00:53:38,180
So, great. Good to know that when
in doubt, you're not on my team.

955
00:53:38,182 --> 00:53:42,084
- Paige.
- Just go. You're gonna be late for golf.

956
00:53:44,087 --> 00:53:47,189
- You can't really be late for golf.
- Whatever. Just go.

957
00:53:47,191 --> 00:53:48,958
Okay.

958
00:54:05,508 --> 00:54:07,776
That feels good.

959
00:54:07,778 --> 00:54:09,645
Yeah? You like that? Yeah.

960
00:54:09,647 --> 00:54:11,780
It's my signature move.

961
00:54:11,782 --> 00:54:13,616
"Signature move."

962
00:54:13,618 --> 00:54:15,184
Yeah.

963
00:54:21,057 --> 00:54:24,026
- You and Vanessa?
- Shh. no.

964
00:54:24,028 --> 00:54:25,661
No. I...

965
00:54:25,663 --> 00:54:29,632
Not yet. Nothing happened yet.
We've just been talking about it.

966
00:54:29,634 --> 00:54:32,368
Good. You scared me.

967
00:54:32,370 --> 00:54:34,370
You think Jenn
would really freak out?

968
00:54:34,372 --> 00:54:36,739
Sasha, Jenn would die. Okay.

969
00:54:36,741 --> 00:54:39,108
Okay. Fine.

970
00:54:39,110 --> 00:54:41,176
I won't hook up with her then.

971
00:54:46,016 --> 00:54:48,651
You know you can trust me
with this stuff, right?

972
00:54:48,653 --> 00:54:50,519
What do you mean?

973
00:54:50,521 --> 00:54:54,790
I mean, like, if something
has already happened...

974
00:54:54,792 --> 00:54:57,626
between you and Vanessa,

975
00:54:57,628 --> 00:55:00,262
and you wanted to confide
in me, you totally can,

976
00:55:00,264 --> 00:55:03,198
and I promise I won't tell Jenn.

977
00:55:07,637 --> 00:55:10,506
I have been hooking up with
Vanessa for a little while.

978
00:55:12,409 --> 00:55:15,044
Okay. No judgment.

979
00:55:16,112 --> 00:55:17,479
Seriously?

980
00:55:17,481 --> 00:55:19,381
Come on. If lesbians
weren't allowed to date...

981
00:55:19,383 --> 00:55:21,950
anyone their friends have already
dated, then we'd all be celibate.

982
00:55:21,952 --> 00:55:25,187
Oh, my God.

983
00:55:31,761 --> 00:55:35,664
Hey, Jenn. I was just with other Jen.
<i> Fuck you.</i>

984
00:55:35,666 --> 00:55:37,566
Really, Sasha? Vanessa?

985
00:55:37,568 --> 00:55:40,903
After I cried for months on your
shoulder about how badly she hurt me?

986
00:55:41,738 --> 00:55:45,007
Oh, God. Oh, my God.

987
00:55:45,009 --> 00:55:47,042
You weren't supposed to
find out like this.

988
00:55:47,044 --> 00:55:48,644
What? So now that
Paige ditched you,

989
00:55:48,646 --> 00:55:51,880
you're just gonna fuck anyone over
so you don't have to be alone?

990
00:55:51,882 --> 00:55:54,049
Paige didn't ditch me.
<i> Oh, please.</i>

991
00:55:54,051 --> 00:55:56,185
Wake up. You've been replaced.
And you know what?

992
00:55:56,187 --> 00:55:58,620
You deserve it, because I have
never been this betrayed.

993
00:55:58,622 --> 00:56:01,290
Oh, really, Jenn?
You've never been this betrayed?

994
00:56:01,292 --> 00:56:04,159
Even when two of your exes
started fucking each other?

995
00:56:04,161 --> 00:56:08,030
And, please, you're not some saint. You
slept with a married girl last year.

996
00:56:08,032 --> 00:56:10,532
Cameron was in
an open relationship, okay?

997
00:56:10,534 --> 00:56:13,435
You know what? This isn't about that.
This is not about that.

998
00:56:13,437 --> 00:56:17,239
This is about our friendship,
which is over. So good-bye.

999
00:56:17,241 --> 00:56:19,608
Oh, and you know what? Vanessa
doesn't shave her pussy hair...

1000
00:56:19,610 --> 00:56:21,610
or even trim it,
so good luck down there.

1001
00:56:21,612 --> 00:56:24,279
Oh, well, guess what.
I already know that.

1002
00:56:27,484 --> 00:56:29,017
I'm not even gonna...

1003
00:56:30,186 --> 00:56:32,821
Oh, my God. Jen...

1004
00:56:33,990 --> 00:56:37,793
<i>Sasha, what's up?</i>
You fucking told Jenn?

1005
00:56:48,037 --> 00:56:49,772
Hey. Hi.

1006
00:57:05,088 --> 00:57:08,991
Look, I'm sorry about earlier, okay?
I did not mean to take a side.

1007
00:57:08,993 --> 00:57:10,826
I don't know that guy.

1008
00:57:11,294 --> 00:57:12,861
Thanks.

1009
00:57:14,564 --> 00:57:16,598
Don't be like that. Like what?

1010
00:57:16,600 --> 00:57:18,901
"Thanks."
I didn't say it like that.

1011
00:57:18,903 --> 00:57:20,969
Okay. Never mind.

1012
00:57:26,843 --> 00:57:28,644
Enough!

1013
00:57:28,646 --> 00:57:30,479
I miss you, okay?

1014
00:57:30,481 --> 00:57:31,647
Okay.

1015
00:57:31,649 --> 00:57:34,183
Golfing was great.
Thank you for asking.

1016
00:57:49,632 --> 00:57:52,301
You're a fucking bitch.

1017
00:57:54,271 --> 00:57:56,171
Nora, hi.

1018
00:57:56,173 --> 00:57:58,173
I'm sorry that you heard that.
I was on...

1019
00:57:58,175 --> 00:58:02,478
I was, uh, researching our properties,
and someone said something...

1020
00:58:02,480 --> 00:58:05,113
This package needs to go out
to our China office immediately.

1021
00:58:05,115 --> 00:58:07,316
Right. Okay. I'm sorry.

1022
00:58:07,318 --> 00:58:08,884
Okay.

1023
00:58:17,827 --> 00:58:19,528
Hey.

1024
00:58:20,230 --> 00:58:21,330
Hey.

1025
00:58:21,332 --> 00:58:23,599
Look what I found
in the conference room.

1026
00:58:23,601 --> 00:58:24,867
Oh. Hi.

1027
00:58:24,869 --> 00:58:26,468
Hey.

1028
00:58:26,470 --> 00:58:28,737
Is it already 6:00?

1029
00:58:28,739 --> 00:58:30,572
Have you been here all day?
Yeah.

1030
00:58:30,574 --> 00:58:33,308
I just got totally absorbed
in my short story.

1031
00:58:33,310 --> 00:58:37,546
Pete stopped by to give me his notes, and they
just sent me in this whole new direction.

1032
00:58:38,983 --> 00:58:41,416
And Pete is the guy that you
met in the coffee shop, right?

1033
00:58:41,418 --> 00:58:43,886
The writer guy? Yeah, yeah.

1034
00:58:43,888 --> 00:58:46,588
And he teaches part-time
at the university.

1035
00:58:46,590 --> 00:58:50,526
They gave him this amazing
fellowship that, like, no one gets.

1036
00:58:50,528 --> 00:58:52,528
He has all these ins
at<i> The New Yorker,</i>

1037
00:58:52,530 --> 00:58:54,696
so he's gonna help me
submit this once it's done.

1038
00:58:54,698 --> 00:58:56,899
Cool.

1039
00:58:56,901 --> 00:58:59,601
Oh. Were you having wine?

1040
00:58:59,603 --> 00:59:04,072
Oh, yeah. Actually, it's... it's gone.
Pete just brought some earlier.

1041
00:59:04,074 --> 00:59:06,441
Oh. I thought it was
a work meeting.

1042
00:59:07,644 --> 00:59:11,413
It was, at first,
but then we hung out, and...

1043
00:59:11,415 --> 00:59:14,816
I don't know. I guess I hadn't told
him that I was gay or something.

1044
00:59:14,818 --> 00:59:18,620
People don't normally assume I
am, because I'm really feminine.

1045
00:59:19,656 --> 00:59:21,523
But, um,

1046
00:59:21,525 --> 00:59:26,161
at one point, he... kissed me.

1047
00:59:26,163 --> 00:59:29,197
What? Oh, my God.

1048
00:59:29,199 --> 00:59:30,999
Awkward.

1049
00:59:31,001 --> 00:59:34,503
Yeah. That's what
I would have thought.

1050
00:59:36,172 --> 00:59:38,507
I don't know how to
tell you this, but...

1051
00:59:39,208 --> 00:59:41,276
there was something there.

1052
00:59:42,779 --> 00:59:44,346
But...

1053
00:59:46,082 --> 00:59:47,549
you're gay.

1054
00:59:49,018 --> 00:59:53,188
I mean, I don't know.

1055
00:59:53,190 --> 00:59:56,058
I don't know. I feel like I've
been saying I'm gay for so long...

1056
00:59:56,060 --> 00:59:59,561
that maybe I just stopped getting
in touch with where I actually am,

1057
00:59:59,563 --> 01:00:01,496
you know, in the spectrum.

1058
01:00:01,498 --> 01:00:05,601
All I know is I owe it
to myself to find out.

1059
01:00:08,438 --> 01:00:10,372
Okay. Got it.

1060
01:00:10,374 --> 01:00:13,208
And I owe it to you
to be honest.

1061
01:00:14,844 --> 01:00:16,812
Not that I could have lied.

1062
01:00:16,814 --> 01:00:20,716
I'm just one of those people who's
not capable of a false moment.

1063
01:00:36,599 --> 01:00:41,069
All right. I got a cake mix, I got a
bottle of scotch, I got a face mask...

1064
01:00:41,071 --> 01:00:44,873
and a really weird jewelry-making
kit that I found at CVS.

1065
01:00:44,875 --> 01:00:46,875
So what are we doing first?

1066
01:00:48,778 --> 01:00:51,046
You think two N's
will ever forgive me?

1067
01:00:51,048 --> 01:00:55,283
Yeah. I mean, she'll probably hold
a grudge 'cause she loves drama.

1068
01:00:55,285 --> 01:00:57,185
Yeah, but so does one "N,"

1069
01:00:57,187 --> 01:01:00,088
even though she keeps saying she
doesn't want to get in between us.

1070
01:01:00,090 --> 01:01:03,792
As soon as two N's gets a girlfriend,
she's gonna forget all about this.

1071
01:01:03,794 --> 01:01:05,794
She was so mad.

1072
01:01:07,463 --> 01:01:09,798
You know, maybe I should
remember next time that...

1073
01:01:09,800 --> 01:01:12,434
if it starts off
with a ton of drama,

1074
01:01:12,436 --> 01:01:14,469
maybe I shouldn't go there.

1075
01:01:14,471 --> 01:01:17,305
That's probably
a good rule of thumb.

1076
01:01:17,307 --> 01:01:19,875
"Rule of thumb." Shut up.

1077
01:01:19,877 --> 01:01:22,511
No, I don't know.

1078
01:01:22,513 --> 01:01:25,633
Maybe I should date someone a
little bit more... More mature?

1079
01:01:26,883 --> 01:01:31,086
Okay. I was gonna say
more, you know, sure she's gay,

1080
01:01:31,088 --> 01:01:32,921
but, yeah,
what do you really think?

1081
01:01:32,923 --> 01:01:34,856
No, I just...

1082
01:01:34,858 --> 01:01:38,760
I think that you deserve to be with
somebody who's got their shit together.

1083
01:01:38,762 --> 01:01:41,029
Yeah, no, you're right.

1084
01:01:41,031 --> 01:01:43,465
Or at the very least someone
who doesn't go on and on...

1085
01:01:43,467 --> 01:01:46,401
about how good she is in bed...
while we're in bed.

1086
01:01:46,403 --> 01:01:48,437
What? Yeah, I know.

1087
01:01:49,472 --> 01:01:51,473
It's kind of hard
to stay in the moment...

1088
01:01:51,475 --> 01:01:54,943
when your partner keeps telling you that
everything she's doing is her signature move.

1089
01:01:54,945 --> 01:01:57,612
She did not. No. She did a lot.

1090
01:01:57,614 --> 01:01:59,948
Oh, my God.

1091
01:02:01,651 --> 01:02:04,052
Oh.

1092
01:02:04,054 --> 01:02:06,955
It's so late. I should
probably get going.

1093
01:02:06,957 --> 01:02:09,024
No, don't go. We're having fun.

1094
01:02:09,026 --> 01:02:13,428
I know, but Tim doesn't like it
when I drive home late at night.

1095
01:02:14,864 --> 01:02:17,766
Does he like it when you drive
home with your face like that?

1096
01:02:17,768 --> 01:02:20,102
Gorgeous. It's gorgeous.
I'm hideous. Don't touch me.

1097
01:02:22,405 --> 01:02:26,041
I promise you, you're gonna
get over Vanessa so fast.

1098
01:02:26,043 --> 01:02:28,110
You just gotta
get back out there.

1099
01:02:57,406 --> 01:02:59,241
Oh.

1100
01:02:59,243 --> 01:03:00,575
Hi.

1101
01:03:13,857 --> 01:03:16,324
Lucas is bringing fireworks.
Tim, no.

1102
01:03:16,326 --> 01:03:17,859
Paige, maybe.

1103
01:03:21,798 --> 01:03:24,065
Thank you for getting that.
How much do I owe you?

1104
01:03:24,067 --> 01:03:28,470
Um, nothing. I think I can
afford some frozen water.

1105
01:03:30,306 --> 01:03:33,175
Um, hey, there's this
new lawyer at my firm.

1106
01:03:33,177 --> 01:03:36,845
She's really cool, and she's gay.
Oh.

1107
01:03:36,847 --> 01:03:40,081
Yeah. Her name is Angelica.
She's really pretty.

1108
01:03:40,083 --> 01:03:42,150
You know,
she's got her shit together.

1109
01:03:42,152 --> 01:03:44,586
Angelica.

1110
01:03:44,588 --> 01:03:46,688
Well, I guess if,
I don't know, we're free,

1111
01:03:46,690 --> 01:03:49,758
we can get a group or
something together. Yeah.

1112
01:03:49,760 --> 01:03:52,194
Um, I invited her here today.

1113
01:03:53,129 --> 01:03:54,963
Oh. It was super last minute...

1114
01:03:54,965 --> 01:03:57,532
'cause she doesn't really know
anybody in town, but no big deal.

1115
01:03:57,534 --> 01:04:01,503
Yeah. You didn't tell her it was a setup,
right? No. Not at all. No pressure.

1116
01:04:01,505 --> 01:04:04,406
But, you know, wouldn't hurt
if you guys fell in love...

1117
01:04:04,408 --> 01:04:07,576
and we went on double dates
and lived happily ever after.

1118
01:04:07,578 --> 01:04:09,744
Okay, psycho.

1119
01:04:13,049 --> 01:04:15,550
Do I look too much like a lesbian?
You are a lesbian.

1120
01:04:15,552 --> 01:04:19,454
Yeah, but I don't
want to look... gay.

1121
01:04:19,456 --> 01:04:22,090
You're, like, offensive
to yourself.

1122
01:04:23,125 --> 01:04:25,460
I mean, I'm not offended.

1123
01:04:29,699 --> 01:04:33,602
- Is that her?
- Yeah. Isn't she pretty?

1124
01:04:33,604 --> 01:04:36,771
Why is she so dressed up?
She just came from work.

1125
01:04:38,040 --> 01:04:40,909
She rich?
That's a really fancy bag.

1126
01:04:40,911 --> 01:04:43,111
I don't know. I don't know
her that well. Come on.

1127
01:04:43,113 --> 01:04:46,514
Sasha, let's just go say hi. No. I don't
need to make a big deal out of saying hi.

1128
01:04:46,516 --> 01:04:48,650
Just, you know, if we
cross paths, then I'll...

1129
01:04:48,652 --> 01:04:49,918
Come on. No. Shh!

1130
01:04:49,920 --> 01:04:51,253
Sasha... Shh!

1131
01:04:51,255 --> 01:04:54,789
So has Sasha ever been with a dude?
Lucas, she's gay.

1132
01:04:54,791 --> 01:04:57,552
Well, she flirts with me.
Brian, she's gay.

1133
01:04:58,060 --> 01:05:00,262
Now, that's my type.

1134
01:05:02,632 --> 01:05:04,699
Oh, hey. Also gay.

1135
01:05:05,401 --> 01:05:07,469
Your party sucks.

1136
01:05:07,471 --> 01:05:08,937
No. Sasha, chill.

1137
01:05:08,939 --> 01:05:11,006
Is she coming over here?

1138
01:05:12,141 --> 01:05:14,109
Hey! Hi. Hi, Paige.

1139
01:05:14,111 --> 01:05:16,478
Thank you for coming.
Thank you for having me.

1140
01:05:16,480 --> 01:05:20,081
Oh, Angelica, this is Sasha.
Sasha, Angelica.

1141
01:05:20,083 --> 01:05:22,317
Hey. Hi.

1142
01:05:26,923 --> 01:05:29,357
So you just came from work.

1143
01:05:29,359 --> 01:05:32,694
Oh, yeah. I had to go in to finish
up some stuff this morning.

1144
01:05:32,696 --> 01:05:35,163
Blows.

1145
01:05:35,165 --> 01:05:39,067
Actually, I didn't mind it. I know
this is nerdy, but I love my work.

1146
01:05:39,702 --> 01:05:41,403
Oh.

1147
01:05:41,405 --> 01:05:45,040
What do you do?
I'm a receptionist.

1148
01:05:45,042 --> 01:05:47,409
And a really talented musician.

1149
01:05:48,544 --> 01:05:50,612
I'm gonna go play beer pong.

1150
01:05:50,614 --> 01:05:53,715
I love beer pong. Cool.

1151
01:05:55,885 --> 01:05:57,152
Oh!

1152
01:05:57,154 --> 01:05:58,620
Even better. Does that count?

1153
01:05:58,622 --> 01:06:00,055
Of course that counts.

1154
01:06:00,057 --> 01:06:02,857
"Does that count?"
Of course that counts.

1155
01:06:02,859 --> 01:06:08,663
She drinks P.B.R., she plays beer
pong, she is the perfect woman.

1156
01:06:08,665 --> 01:06:11,766
Brian, you're just... You're drunk now.
We need a new player.

1157
01:06:11,768 --> 01:06:13,735
Does anyone want... Angelica,
you want to get in there?

1158
01:06:13,737 --> 01:06:15,470
- I'm in.
- Come on up.

1159
01:06:15,472 --> 01:06:17,205
Cool, Tim. Cool, man.

1160
01:06:17,207 --> 01:06:20,408
I don't think we need another player.
You don't want to get your suit all...

1161
01:06:20,410 --> 01:06:22,577
Ah, screw it. I hate this suit.
messed up.

1162
01:06:22,579 --> 01:06:26,114
You're really good at this. You
should, uh, give me some tips.

1163
01:06:26,116 --> 01:06:29,751
I think I'm actually gonna
just sit this one out.

1164
01:06:30,553 --> 01:06:33,788
I'm just gonna finish my beer.

1165
01:06:33,790 --> 01:06:36,925
Sasha, this is for you.
I call it my signature move.

1166
01:06:38,327 --> 01:06:42,797
Oh! Angelica! Get it.

1167
01:06:42,799 --> 01:06:44,466
Yeah.

1168
01:06:44,468 --> 01:06:45,767
More. More!

1169
01:06:45,769 --> 01:06:47,569
Oh!

1170
01:06:47,571 --> 01:06:50,071
Crap. I am such a klutz.

1171
01:06:50,073 --> 01:06:52,307
Be right back.
That's commitment.

1172
01:06:52,309 --> 01:06:54,776
It's okay. Sasha, you should
go help her clean up.

1173
01:06:54,778 --> 01:06:56,611
It's fine. I think she's got it.

1174
01:06:56,613 --> 01:07:00,415
Sasha, you should go help her clean up.
It'll give you guys a chance to talk.

1175
01:07:00,417 --> 01:07:02,650
I think she's got it.
I'm gonna go get some chips.

1176
01:07:02,652 --> 01:07:04,319
Sasha...

1177
01:07:06,522 --> 01:07:08,189
Sasha. What?

1178
01:07:08,191 --> 01:07:11,559
Sasha, why are you not trying, like,
at all? What are you talking about?

1179
01:07:11,561 --> 01:07:13,361
I thought you said
there was no pressure.

1180
01:07:13,363 --> 01:07:15,130
There isn't, but you're,
like, being rude.

1181
01:07:15,132 --> 01:07:18,252
How am I being rude? She doesn't
even know it's a setup.

1182
01:07:20,469 --> 01:07:24,172
You told her it's a setup. I just thought
you guys would really like each other.

1183
01:07:24,174 --> 01:07:26,174
Why? Because you know
she's not my type.

1184
01:07:26,176 --> 01:07:29,611
Well, maybe that would be good for you.
Good for me?

1185
01:07:29,613 --> 01:07:31,913
You know what I mean. You were
the one who was just saying...

1186
01:07:31,915 --> 01:07:33,615
that you wanted to date
someone more mature.

1187
01:07:33,617 --> 01:07:35,650
You're the one
who keeps saying that.

1188
01:07:35,652 --> 01:07:39,721
I'm sorry that I don't like the one person
that you've ever tried to set me up with.

1189
01:07:39,723 --> 01:07:42,690
You were really picky when you were
single too, remember? Not like this.

1190
01:07:42,692 --> 01:07:45,860
Oh, you're saying that you would have
liked the male equivalent of Angelica?

1191
01:07:45,862 --> 01:07:48,730
Yes. That is such bullshit.

1192
01:07:48,732 --> 01:07:50,732
No, it's not. Yes, it is.

1193
01:07:50,734 --> 01:07:55,570
You're saying that if a man showed
up at a barbecue in a suit...

1194
01:07:55,572 --> 01:07:58,773
and was saying things like, "Oh, crap.
I'm such a klutz"...

1195
01:07:58,775 --> 01:08:02,110
and was hovering all over you,
you would have been into that?

1196
01:08:05,714 --> 01:08:07,282
Angelica...

1197
01:08:11,253 --> 01:08:12,954
Thank you.

1198
01:08:15,524 --> 01:08:18,827
Angelica, please, you have to believe
me, this has zero to do with you.

1199
01:08:18,829 --> 01:08:20,695
This is all about me and Sasha.

1200
01:08:20,697 --> 01:08:23,198
Honestly, it doesn't even matter.
I'm too old for this shit.

1201
01:08:23,200 --> 01:08:26,000
But... See you at work.
Thanks for the invite.

1202
01:08:31,407 --> 01:08:33,374
I don't even know why I try.

1203
01:08:33,376 --> 01:08:34,976
What do you mean?

1204
01:08:34,978 --> 01:08:37,412
Just be honest with me.

1205
01:08:37,414 --> 01:08:40,381
If you don't want to change anything
about your life, just say that.

1206
01:08:40,383 --> 01:08:44,185
Admit that you're happy dating
22-year-olds and going out every night,

1207
01:08:44,187 --> 01:08:47,055
and I will stop putting myself
out there trying to help you.

1208
01:08:47,057 --> 01:08:49,491
I never asked you
to put yourself out there.

1209
01:08:49,493 --> 01:08:53,261
Hmm. Okay. Then stop calling me every
day complaining about your life...

1210
01:08:53,263 --> 01:08:56,831
and then not do anything about it,
because it's a little confusing for me.

1211
01:08:56,833 --> 01:08:58,166
Okay. Fine.

1212
01:09:00,002 --> 01:09:03,071
Guess I should have known that as soon as
you found someone else to couple up with...

1213
01:09:03,073 --> 01:09:05,206
that you'd be done with me.

1214
01:09:07,576 --> 01:09:09,944
Sasha, that is not fair.

1215
01:09:09,946 --> 01:09:12,814
Okay, yes, I'm less available
to you now than I was before,

1216
01:09:12,816 --> 01:09:17,185
when there was no one else in my life and we
talked every night till 2:00 in the morning,

1217
01:09:17,187 --> 01:09:20,221
but that was always gonna change
when one of us met someone.

1218
01:09:20,223 --> 01:09:25,326
I mean, you don't talk to your friends till 2:00
in the morning anymore. You stop needing that.

1219
01:09:26,762 --> 01:09:28,730
But you still have that.

1220
01:09:30,032 --> 01:09:31,432
What?

1221
01:09:34,003 --> 01:09:36,237
You...

1222
01:09:36,239 --> 01:09:39,140
You still talk to someone
at 2:00 in the morning.

1223
01:09:39,142 --> 01:09:41,309
It's just Tim now.

1224
01:09:42,144 --> 01:09:44,112
Nothing changed for you.

1225
01:09:44,114 --> 01:09:47,982
It just changed for me. Can
you acknowledge that, please?

1226
01:09:50,286 --> 01:09:52,353
Hey.

1227
01:09:52,355 --> 01:09:54,489
Who wants some more s'mores?

1228
01:09:57,326 --> 01:09:59,561
Why don't you tell him?

1229
01:10:01,063 --> 01:10:03,131
You tell him everything else.

1230
01:10:08,370 --> 01:10:10,972
Did I fuck something up?

1231
01:10:20,082 --> 01:10:22,217
<i>Good evening.
Can I take your order?</i>

1232
01:10:22,219 --> 01:10:26,321
Yeah, can I just have, um, an order
of mozzarella sticks, please?

1233
01:10:26,323 --> 01:10:29,157
<i>Oh, I'm sorry. We are out
of mozzarella sticks.</i>

1234
01:10:29,159 --> 01:10:31,492
<i>Would you like some
curly fries instead?</i>

1235
01:10:40,703 --> 01:10:42,604
<i>Excuse me?</i>

1236
01:10:42,606 --> 01:10:44,172
<i>Ma'am?</i>

1237
01:10:49,078 --> 01:10:50,878
Hey. Hey.

1238
01:10:50,880 --> 01:10:53,615
Are you still thinking
about that fight with Sasha?

1239
01:10:53,617 --> 01:10:57,218
That's so crazy she got so mad just
'cause you're trying to set her up.

1240
01:11:44,833 --> 01:11:49,737
<i>You know, when I came into this
to prove to myself that...</i>

1241
01:11:49,739 --> 01:11:52,240
Did they say why they're making
them swim in the shark tank?

1242
01:11:52,242 --> 01:11:54,575
It's just funny. Oh.

1243
01:11:54,577 --> 01:11:56,311
What's a booty tooch?

1244
01:11:56,313 --> 01:11:59,213
It's one of Tyra's sayings. It's when
you stick your butt out in pictures.

1245
01:11:59,215 --> 01:12:01,516
It's like the new smize.

1246
01:12:02,818 --> 01:12:04,986
Smiling with your eyes.

1247
01:12:05,888 --> 01:12:07,755
Oh. Yeah.

1248
01:12:11,360 --> 01:12:13,795
<i>I don't look at my lupus
as a handicap.</i>

1249
01:12:13,797 --> 01:12:16,464
<i>I look at it as a beautiful part
of me that makes me unique.</i>

1250
01:12:16,466 --> 01:12:19,100
Yeah, right. It is a handicap.

1251
01:12:19,102 --> 01:12:22,337
Hope you have enough energy
to swim away from those sharks.

1252
01:12:24,673 --> 01:12:27,442
You're so funny.

1253
01:12:40,689 --> 01:12:44,425
You're, like, the funniest
person I've ever dated.

1254
01:12:54,403 --> 01:12:56,437
Are you Paige Kearns? Yes.

1255
01:12:57,806 --> 01:12:59,874
You've been served.

1256
01:13:14,490 --> 01:13:17,091
Oh, he's taking you to court?

1257
01:13:17,093 --> 01:13:19,694
Good thing I'm a lawyer.

1258
01:13:19,696 --> 01:13:21,963
Okay. Please tell me
you're not serious.

1259
01:13:21,965 --> 01:13:25,433
Ooh. I am. Come on, Paige. You
really care so much about this,

1260
01:13:25,435 --> 01:13:27,368
you're gonna take our
next-door neighbor to court?

1261
01:13:27,370 --> 01:13:29,337
He sued<i> me.</i>

1262
01:13:29,339 --> 01:13:33,174
You hit his car.
You didn't pay him for it.

1263
01:13:33,176 --> 01:13:35,109
I knew it.

1264
01:13:35,111 --> 01:13:38,579
I knew you thought I was wrong.
Why'd you lie to me?

1265
01:13:38,581 --> 01:13:40,615
'Cause it's easier
than disagreeing with you.

1266
01:13:40,617 --> 01:13:43,351
You can disagree with me.
Can I? Like, right now?

1267
01:13:43,353 --> 01:13:48,689
I am not mad at you because you're disagreeing
with me. I am mad because you lied to me.

1268
01:13:48,691 --> 01:13:51,092
Okay. Oh, great. So now
you're just walking away.

1269
01:13:51,094 --> 01:13:55,530
I can't talk to you sometimes. You
never see anyone else's side... ever.

1270
01:13:55,532 --> 01:13:57,865
You always get your way. It's
like every time we fight,

1271
01:13:57,867 --> 01:13:59,834
I have to be
the one to apologize.

1272
01:13:59,836 --> 01:14:03,137
- I'm not gonna do it this time.
- Oh, really? I always get my way?

1273
01:14:03,139 --> 01:14:07,074
Paige, I let you
fucking dress me.

1274
01:14:09,244 --> 01:14:11,045
I do not dress you.

1275
01:14:11,047 --> 01:14:14,449
You can't even admit that?
This is just who I am.

1276
01:14:14,451 --> 01:14:18,152
- Well, then you suck.
- Great. Now you're just being a dick.

1277
01:14:18,154 --> 01:14:20,087
Maybe I just found my dick.

1278
01:14:20,089 --> 01:14:23,191
Whatever! You know, I deserve
to be with somebody...

1279
01:14:23,193 --> 01:14:25,660
who appreciates me
the way that I am.

1280
01:14:25,662 --> 01:14:27,929
And if you can't do that, then...

1281
01:14:30,566 --> 01:14:32,300
Gotcha.

1282
01:14:41,810 --> 01:14:44,545
A package does not
just disappear, Valerie.

1283
01:14:44,547 --> 01:14:47,748
I know. I'm trying to figure it out. FedEx
keeps telling me there's no record of it.

1284
01:14:47,750 --> 01:14:50,885
- Let me see the package log.
- No. I'll do it.

1285
01:14:50,887 --> 01:14:54,188
- What are you guys looking for?
- A package that was sent to China.

1286
01:14:57,759 --> 01:15:01,262
I don't even see any international
shipments on this log.

1287
01:15:01,264 --> 01:15:05,233
You know what? I am actually a
little bit behind on that log,

1288
01:15:05,235 --> 01:15:08,436
and FedEx loses packages
all the time, right?

1289
01:15:08,438 --> 01:15:11,839
Rarely. And this one
cost us a job.

1290
01:15:11,841 --> 01:15:15,042
They accepted a competing bid
because ours wasn't in on time.

1291
01:15:46,542 --> 01:15:48,409
Tim and I had a fight.

1292
01:15:48,411 --> 01:15:50,545
Oh, honey.

1293
01:15:50,547 --> 01:15:52,613
What did he do?

1294
01:15:54,249 --> 01:15:56,169
Shithead. I know.

1295
01:16:25,480 --> 01:16:27,048
Sasha.

1296
01:16:29,117 --> 01:16:30,217
Hey.

1297
01:16:31,219 --> 01:16:32,386
Hi!

1298
01:16:32,388 --> 01:16:34,322
Oh.

1299
01:16:34,324 --> 01:16:36,123
Yo. Hey.

1300
01:16:37,292 --> 01:16:39,060
Is Paige here?

1301
01:16:39,062 --> 01:16:41,796
No. No, just me.

1302
01:16:43,765 --> 01:16:47,201
What's new? Uh, not much.

1303
01:16:47,203 --> 01:16:49,337
Yeah? I got fired.

1304
01:16:49,339 --> 01:16:51,439
Oh, shit.

1305
01:16:51,441 --> 01:16:53,140
Shit. Sorry.

1306
01:16:53,142 --> 01:16:55,743
Paige didn't tell me.
Oh, she doesn't know.

1307
01:16:56,678 --> 01:16:59,158
I haven't seen her
since your barbecue.

1308
01:17:00,582 --> 01:17:03,751
Oh, man. I, um...

1309
01:17:03,753 --> 01:17:07,855
Wow. I knew you guys got in a
little fight over the setup, but...

1310
01:17:07,857 --> 01:17:10,725
Oh. That's what she said
it was about?

1311
01:17:12,094 --> 01:17:15,029
I'm guessing maybe
that wasn't the whole story?

1312
01:17:16,732 --> 01:17:18,599
Yeah. Yeah.

1313
01:17:18,601 --> 01:17:21,936
She has a way of doing that.

1314
01:17:23,438 --> 01:17:26,407
So then she probably didn't
tell you that...

1315
01:17:26,409 --> 01:17:28,776
we got in a fight.

1316
01:17:28,778 --> 01:17:30,711
She's staying at her mom's.

1317
01:17:30,713 --> 01:17:32,880
Really? What happened? Um...

1318
01:17:32,882 --> 01:17:35,216
Okay. Sorry.
It's none of my business.

1319
01:17:35,218 --> 01:17:37,785
No, it's fine. It's fine.
It's all right. It's...

1320
01:17:37,787 --> 01:17:39,920
It's kind of a long story,

1321
01:17:39,922 --> 01:17:42,790
but basically we're both
waiting for an apology.

1322
01:17:43,592 --> 01:17:45,159
From Paige?

1323
01:17:46,828 --> 01:17:48,629
Good luck with that.

1324
01:17:50,699 --> 01:17:53,100
Sorry about your job.

1325
01:17:53,102 --> 01:17:56,137
Yeah. There's nothing
like, you know,

1326
01:17:56,139 --> 01:17:58,139
getting fired from
an entry-level job...

1327
01:17:58,141 --> 01:18:00,541
right before
you turn 30 to just...

1328
01:18:00,543 --> 01:18:02,677
make you question everything.

1329
01:18:02,679 --> 01:18:07,915
Well, I wouldn't... I mean, I hope it's
not making you question everything.

1330
01:18:07,917 --> 01:18:10,584
Who cares about that job? You got
your music. That's the point, right?

1331
01:18:10,586 --> 01:18:13,487
I mean, that's your passion. Well,
it kind of has to be your passion...

1332
01:18:13,489 --> 01:18:16,757
when you spent your whole life saying
it's all you ever wanted to do, and...

1333
01:18:16,759 --> 01:18:20,628
your parents spent a shitload
of money on music school and...

1334
01:18:20,630 --> 01:18:22,990
I couldn't even quit
if I wanted to.

1335
01:18:24,633 --> 01:18:27,501
Do you want to? Whatever.

1336
01:18:27,503 --> 01:18:30,571
It's a little late
to turn back now.

1337
01:18:30,573 --> 01:18:32,573
Well, you know,
that is what I did, actually.

1338
01:18:32,575 --> 01:18:36,377
I used to want to, uh... I used
to want to work on Wall Street.

1339
01:18:36,379 --> 01:18:38,245
Really?

1340
01:18:38,247 --> 01:18:41,015
<i>Wall Street</i> was
my favorite movie as a kid,

1341
01:18:41,017 --> 01:18:43,284
and I went to business school
for a year, actually.

1342
01:18:43,286 --> 01:18:46,554
If you want to talk about
expensive schools, there you go.

1343
01:18:46,556 --> 01:18:48,489
What happened?

1344
01:18:48,491 --> 01:18:51,125
Uh, I fucking hated
business school, so I quit.

1345
01:18:51,127 --> 01:18:55,996
I figured better to turn back now than spend
the rest of my life hating it, you know.

1346
01:19:02,571 --> 01:19:04,572
So where's your girlfriend?

1347
01:19:04,574 --> 01:19:06,774
Mia? She's not my girlfriend.

1348
01:19:06,776 --> 01:19:10,611
Please. She will be. She's
hot, and she worships you.

1349
01:19:12,047 --> 01:19:15,750
Speaking of worship, that
girl should be on a throne.

1350
01:19:16,718 --> 01:19:18,018
Damn.

1351
01:19:22,991 --> 01:19:25,760
Oh, my God. She's so desperate.

1352
01:19:25,762 --> 01:19:28,095
I was never that crazy
when I was single, was I?

1353
01:19:29,564 --> 01:19:31,866
I can't picture you single.

1354
01:19:31,868 --> 01:19:34,268
Yeah? Well, you don't
have to, baby.

1355
01:19:46,481 --> 01:19:48,983
Breathtaking.

1356
01:19:48,985 --> 01:19:51,585
Yeah, it's pretty. I still
don't know about a strapless.

1357
01:19:51,587 --> 01:19:54,188
I just feel like
it's falling off of me.

1358
01:19:54,190 --> 01:19:59,059
Oh, no. You're being crazy. They're
gonna make it fit like a glove.

1359
01:19:59,061 --> 01:20:01,862
See? This thing is not moving anywhere.
Mom. Okay. Okay.

1360
01:20:02,964 --> 01:20:04,265
Oh.

1361
01:20:04,267 --> 01:20:06,367
Oh. Whoa. Watch out. Watch out.

1362
01:20:06,369 --> 01:20:11,505
Where you going? Oh, honey, please do
not check to see if Tim's called again.

1363
01:20:12,374 --> 01:20:14,208
Come on. Let's stay on task.

1364
01:20:14,210 --> 01:20:16,911
Is this a yes? Maybe?

1365
01:20:16,913 --> 01:20:21,949
Mom, it's been two days. I mean, I haven't not
spoken to him in two days since I met him.

1366
01:20:21,951 --> 01:20:25,551
Well, why don't you let him
come to you in his own time?

1367
01:20:26,655 --> 01:20:28,923
Yeah, but what if
he doesn't call me?

1368
01:20:28,925 --> 01:20:31,592
I'll just give
you ladies a minute.

1369
01:20:31,594 --> 01:20:34,795
Thank you. He will. Come on.

1370
01:20:34,797 --> 01:20:39,300
Men are like children.
They'll do whatever you want.

1371
01:20:39,302 --> 01:20:41,735
They just have to think
that it's their idea.

1372
01:20:41,737 --> 01:20:44,972
Come here. Look at this. Do you
think he's gonna let that go?

1373
01:20:44,974 --> 01:20:48,309
Well, he might if you're scowling
like that. Come on. Smile.

1374
01:20:48,311 --> 01:20:51,645
We only get to do this once!
Hopefully.

1375
01:20:51,647 --> 01:20:53,848
Can we just
do this another time?

1376
01:20:53,850 --> 01:20:57,418
I feel weird looking at wedding dresses
when I'm not even speaking to my fiancé.

1377
01:20:57,420 --> 01:21:00,721
Oh, come on. Let's do a couple more.
So is this a yes or a maybe?

1378
01:21:00,723 --> 01:21:04,625
- No. I don't like it.
- Now you're just being dramatic.

1379
01:21:04,627 --> 01:21:06,694
If you want my advice...
I don't want your advice.

1380
01:21:06,696 --> 01:21:10,397
You should listen. Twenty years from now,
when you look at these wedding pictures,

1381
01:21:10,399 --> 01:21:13,300
a strapless dress
will be so much more elegant.

1382
01:21:13,302 --> 01:21:15,135
What is with you
and a strapless?

1383
01:21:15,137 --> 01:21:17,671
I don't like it.
It's not me. It's a cliché.

1384
01:21:17,673 --> 01:21:21,242
It's not flattering, and I'm
not wearing it for my wedding.

1385
01:21:21,244 --> 01:21:24,378
Fine. Why didn't you
just say so?

1386
01:21:24,380 --> 01:21:27,982
I've been trying to, but every
time I try to say something,

1387
01:21:27,984 --> 01:21:30,451
you just talk over me, and you
insist that you're right,

1388
01:21:30,453 --> 01:21:32,987
and it always
has to be your way.

1389
01:21:36,625 --> 01:21:38,192
Tim?

1390
01:21:39,661 --> 01:21:41,228
Tim?

1391
01:21:46,701 --> 01:21:48,269
Tim?

1392
01:22:02,050 --> 01:22:04,251
Hey, can I talk to you
for a second?

1393
01:22:04,253 --> 01:22:06,720
Oh, uh, guys, go in the
house right now, please.

1394
01:22:06,722 --> 01:22:09,356
Go right now. Oh. No, no, no.

1395
01:22:09,358 --> 01:22:12,793
I'm not gonna do anything. I...
I just wanted to tell you...

1396
01:22:12,795 --> 01:22:15,162
that I<i> was</i> texting
when I hit your car.

1397
01:22:19,200 --> 01:22:21,201
I know that it's...

1398
01:22:21,203 --> 01:22:23,971
I know that it's really dangerous, and
people have been killed like that,

1399
01:22:23,973 --> 01:22:27,675
and I need to stop, but first,
can I just pay for your bumper?

1400
01:22:32,013 --> 01:22:33,814
Yes.

1401
01:22:33,816 --> 01:22:36,083
Yeah. Yes, you can. Thank you.

1402
01:23:19,427 --> 01:23:21,395
Bear!

1403
01:23:21,397 --> 01:23:22,696
Hey.

1404
01:23:22,698 --> 01:23:25,666
How are you?
What are you doing here?

1405
01:23:25,668 --> 01:23:28,469
I just wanted to come hang out.
Oh.

1406
01:23:28,471 --> 01:23:32,940
I left you a message saying I'm not free.
Did you not get it?

1407
01:23:34,576 --> 01:23:37,911
Dude, I don't even know where
the fuck my phone is right now.

1408
01:23:39,614 --> 01:23:41,215
How high are you?

1409
01:23:47,288 --> 01:23:49,023
Ta-da!

1410
01:23:49,025 --> 01:23:51,358
I'm making you
matching mittens tomorrow.

1411
01:23:51,360 --> 01:23:54,294
You're gonna look so cute
in Alaska.

1412
01:23:54,296 --> 01:23:55,829
Alaska?

1413
01:23:55,831 --> 01:23:57,998
Oh, shit.

1414
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:00,734
I forgot to surprise you.

1415
01:24:00,736 --> 01:24:03,370
Wait. Does that make sense?
Forgot to surprise you?

1416
01:24:04,939 --> 01:24:09,443
Anyway, Tegan and Sara are doing this
secret concert series in Alaska,

1417
01:24:09,445 --> 01:24:12,246
and for a week, you stay
in an igloo and do Molly,

1418
01:24:12,248 --> 01:24:15,115
and every morning you wake up, and
they're performing with, like,

1419
01:24:15,117 --> 01:24:17,184
a chorus of Latin monks.

1420
01:24:19,287 --> 01:24:23,490
What do you mean? They're Latin
American, or they sing in Latin?

1421
01:24:23,492 --> 01:24:25,659
I don't know.

1422
01:24:25,661 --> 01:24:27,795
Maybe they're not Latin.

1423
01:24:27,797 --> 01:24:30,531
Well, I can't go anyway, because
I really need to find a job.

1424
01:24:30,533 --> 01:24:32,533
You can do that
when we get back.

1425
01:24:32,535 --> 01:24:34,401
I mean, you can get
any receptionist job.

1426
01:24:34,403 --> 01:24:36,537
You've got, like,
eight years experience, right?

1427
01:24:36,539 --> 01:24:39,239
Yeah. Mm-hmm. I know.

1428
01:24:39,241 --> 01:24:42,042
Whatever. It's just till
you're done with your album.

1429
01:24:42,044 --> 01:24:44,884
I don't know if that's
what I want to do anymore.

1430
01:24:46,514 --> 01:24:50,684
What do you mean?
I thought music was your dream.

1431
01:24:50,686 --> 01:24:53,620
Yeah, I know. My dream
was to be a musician,

1432
01:24:53,622 --> 01:24:56,623
not spend every day
having panic attacks...

1433
01:24:56,625 --> 01:25:00,427
and sitting behind a reception desk for
eight hours wanting to blow my brains out.

1434
01:25:01,396 --> 01:25:04,264
I just think I...

1435
01:25:04,266 --> 01:25:07,301
I've tried so hard
to hang on to this goal,

1436
01:25:07,303 --> 01:25:09,203
and I'm wasting my life.

1437
01:25:09,205 --> 01:25:10,671
I...

1438
01:25:11,873 --> 01:25:15,175
I don't know. I just want
to be happy, and I...

1439
01:25:16,845 --> 01:25:19,446
I think I need to find
a job I don't hate.

1440
01:25:21,182 --> 01:25:24,685
But can't you do that
after we get back from Alaska?

1441
01:25:25,320 --> 01:25:27,654
Come on.

1442
01:25:27,656 --> 01:25:28,889
Please?

1443
01:25:28,891 --> 01:25:30,757
No. Stop it.

1444
01:25:32,861 --> 01:25:36,497
I'm sorry. That... It's not your fault.
I just...

1445
01:25:36,499 --> 01:25:38,398
I can't do this.

1446
01:25:38,400 --> 01:25:40,134
Alaska?

1447
01:25:40,136 --> 01:25:42,202
I know. You just said that.

1448
01:25:43,471 --> 01:25:45,739
No, I mean,

1449
01:25:46,674 --> 01:25:48,242
Mia...

1450
01:26:30,552 --> 01:26:33,453
Call voice mail.

1451
01:26:33,455 --> 01:26:37,691
<i>Sorry. I don't understand.</i>
Call voice mail.

1452
01:26:37,693 --> 01:26:39,993
<i>Sorry. I don't understand.</i>

1453
01:26:39,995 --> 01:26:41,628
Fuck it.

1454
01:27:12,860 --> 01:27:15,295
Hey, bitch!

1455
01:27:50,665 --> 01:27:52,666
Just tell me. I hate surprises.

1456
01:27:52,668 --> 01:27:55,836
No. You'll just have to
find out tomorrow.

1457
01:27:55,838 --> 01:27:59,006
You can't not tell me what song
you're gonna sing at<i> my</i> wedding.

1458
01:27:59,008 --> 01:28:01,508
Okay, fine. I'll tell you.

1459
01:28:01,510 --> 01:28:04,011
You know that song that's like...

1460
01:28:05,781 --> 01:28:08,548
No. Nope. Not happening.

1461
01:28:08,550 --> 01:28:10,951
Okay. Fine, fine, fine.
Sorry. I'll tell you.

1462
01:28:15,490 --> 01:28:18,125
Did you know that the Hanson
brothers are still making music?

1463
01:28:18,127 --> 01:28:21,561
Sometimes I just want to...

1464
01:28:21,563 --> 01:28:24,197
- Please, just tell me, Sasha.
- Okay, fine. I'll tell you.

1465
01:28:25,800 --> 01:28:28,368
But first I have
a really serious question.

1466
01:28:29,904 --> 01:28:31,571
Hang on.

1467
01:28:36,244 --> 01:28:40,380
Do you think that Tim will
be jealous of my tux?

1468
01:28:42,717 --> 01:28:44,351
No.
