1
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:25,472
There's an oJd saying:

2
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:28,837
"Why buy the cow
when you can get the miJk for free?"

3
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,073
It's a fascinating phiJosophicaJ query,
marriage versus sex.

4
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:35,231
And if you're considering the former...

5
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:37,391
...odds are you'JJ hear the saying
from a friend...

6
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:40,358
...who cJaims to be getting
an abundant amount of the Jatter.

7
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:45,360
And incidentaJJy, it's buJJshit.

8
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:47,829
Bullshit. You think this is bullshit.

9
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:52,720
- Yeah.
- Well, it isn't.

10
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:55,951
After five years, I think
I have the right to broach the subject.

11
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:57,189
So you broach and we talk.

12
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:59,476
You don't have to go
and give me an ultimatum.

13
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:02,798
Don't use that word. I hate that word.

14
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:06,837
I'm not too fond of it either,
but what else would you call this?

15
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:08,674
A deadline.

16
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:46,434
So I'm a little indecisive.

17
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:48,909
That doesn't mean you have to hold
a gun to my head.

18
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,195
- Sorry.
- Don't be so melodramatic.

19
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:52,918
That's why I'm taking this transfer.

20
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,719
I'll be 3,000 miles away.
I can't hold a gun to your head.

21
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:58,712
- Stop saying that!
- Shit.

22
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:04,475
Admit it. You're using this transfer thing
as an ultim... Deadline.

23
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:09,958
Okay. So I wouldn't have signed up for it
if you hadn't freaked on Tyler's news.

24
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:11,910
Hello.

25
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,991
David! What's up, what's up?

26
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:18,636
Tyler, you are wasted. Sarah.

27
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:21,356
Damn. How'd you know, my brother?

28
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:24,792
- The faux urban street slang.
- Nigger, please!

29
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:29,078
- What time is it back there, like 2:00?
- You know this city never sJeeps.

30
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:31,230
Y'all be counting on your sheep.

31
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:35,518
Listen, man,
I met the most amazing woman.

32
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:37,318
- She is...
- Fly?

33
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:39,277
Better than fly. She's super fly.

34
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:42,511
What did I tell you about drinking and
dating? Go to bed and sleep her off.

35
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:43,999
We're getting married!

36
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,119
What?

37
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:49,148
You got to meet her, you and Sarah.
She's Jike...

38
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:52,437
- Super fly?
- Better than super fJy, man.

39
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:54,113
She's the one.

40
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:57,716
You know how they say
that you can just teJJ? David?

41
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:00,196
You still there, bitch?

42
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:04,558
- Yeah, I'm here. I'm just...
- This is it, man. It just hit me.

43
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:09,032
It was like a blinding realisation.
Like pure truth.

44
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:13,749
Anyway, you and Sarah got to meet her.
You're gonna Jove her. Her name's JuJie.

45
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:16,115
She's sweet, she's beautiful...

46
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:18,830
...she's "chocolicious"...

47
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:23,437
Tyler? Hello! Tyler, you okay?

48
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,353
Sounds like true love.

49
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:34,597
So you are leaving me alone
to deal with this for two months.

50
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:37,149
You need to be alone to deal with this.

51
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:40,676
Which is why I strongly advise you
against consulting with Mike.

52
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:48,270
BeJJissimo. Magnifico.

53
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:52,598
You are so hot!

54
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:54,636
You beast.

55
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:57,711
Is that Ricky Martin over there?

56
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:01,070
God, no. It's Mike Hanson.

57
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:07,109
You're beautiful. Modesty, now. Modesty.

58
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,714
I love you. No words.

59
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:18,956
No, I'm not. Yes, I am.
Don't do it. I'm doing it.

60
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:20,268
Don't do it.

61
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:22,195
I did it.

62
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:33,036
I'd do me.

63
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:37,635
- Oh, man! The "testy" tuck again?
- Do you like what you see?

64
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:41,676
- No?
- Would you put on some clothes?

65
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:43,751
We only got two hours
of "Happy Hour" left.

66
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:45,717
Let me just get my towel, okay?

67
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:50,195
Got it. There we go.

68
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:53,239
You got issues, I mean, real issues.

69
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:57,072
He may be your friend,
but he's no Deepak Chopra.

70
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:59,469
He is also not running off to New York.

71
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:05,357
CUse this time to make an informed
decision or none of this'll mean anything.

72
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:07,636
I can't let this not mean anything.

73
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:26,197
So you love her, right?

74
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:28,589
- Of course I love her.
- There you go.

75
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:31,156
Let's not get carried away here, guys.

76
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:34,198
No one's doubting your love for each other.

77
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:36,635
A blind man could smell your love.

78
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:39,109
- But this is a major...
- Huge.

79
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:42,590
No, colossal, thing you're considering here.

80
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:45,839
As your friend,
it's my duty to ask the tough questions.

81
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:47,876
- What?
- Sex.

82
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:51,473
- Sex is still good?
- The sex is awesome.

83
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:54,358
I've got no complaints
about what we have.

84
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:56,112
It would be a lot easier if I did.

85
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:57,952
It's got to be something.
You waited five years.

86
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:00,759
- So what is it?
- It's nothing. Let's drop it.

87
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:05,197
We're your friends. We want to help you.
But we can't do it unless you let us in!

88
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:06,793
It's no one thing!

89
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:09,235
There's a lot of factors
in these kind of situations.

90
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:14,030
- So what is it? Give us one.
- Other women, all right?

91
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:15,838
You've had other women? How many?

92
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:20,360
I'm not quite sure that I've had enough.

93
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:24,832
- That's ridiculous. How many is enough?
- Twice your age.

94
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,878
It's not about quantity, it's about quality.

95
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:30,600
What's wrong with going
for both quality and quantity?

96
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:33,797
Being the best he can be,
that's the American way.

97
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:38,314
Foul.

98
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:39,674
- Foul?
- It's foul.

99
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:42,638
- What foul?
- Humping before the shot.

100
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:44,751
- I was humping you?
- Prison-style.

101
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:46,996
Whatever. If I was humping you,
you'd know it.

102
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:48,713
- Would I?
- Yeah, you'd know it.

103
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,631
You'd feel it. I wasn't humping you.

104
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,438
- Deep, right?
- Yep.

105
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:56,038
A little help?

106
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:09,718
The thing is,
I never expected to feel empowered.

107
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:13,159
For better, for worse,
something is set into motion...

108
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:16,676
...and I set it off.
Am I a manipulative bitch or what?

109
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:18,393
Welcome to my world.

110
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:21,790
You should feel empowered.
It wasn't easy, but it had to be done.

111
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:24,075
What was the alternative, to keep waiting?

112
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:27,516
It's not like the sex gets better
with every passing year. Am I right?

113
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:31,719
I'm sorry that was so quick.
I'm kind of beat.

114
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:34,360
That's okay.
Orgasms are overrated anyway.

115
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:35,993
Hey, South Park is on.

116
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:39,751
You had the courage
to look him in the eye and say:

117
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:42,513
"Buddy boy,
it's time to shit or get off the pot."

118
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:45,637
And marrying me would be the "shit" part
of that colourful analogy?

119
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:46,596
Thanks.

120
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:55,790
I'm sorry, I don't get it. Sarah is hot.

121
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:59,077
Behind every good-Iooking chick is a guy
who's tired of nailing her.

122
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:02,159
- Am I right, Davey?
- No, you're wrong, asshole.

123
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:05,835
So who's missing from your repertoire:
cowgirls, wilder chicks, the Amish, what?

124
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:08,593
It's not like that.
Let's just drop it, all right?

125
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:15,634
- Do you guys believe in "the one"?
- As in one soul mate?

126
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:17,836
The perfect match that completes us,
makes us whole?

127
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:19,911
- Exactly.
- Hell, no.

128
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:22,833
I don't know. But if there's such a thing
and Sarah's it...

129
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,993
...then that means it's inevitable.
It's a lock, right? It's like destiny.

130
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:28,908
I guess so.

131
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:34,394
Okay. So, if it's inevitable,
why rush into it?

132
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:39,308
- You're still not telling us everything.
- Of course, I'm not. You're my friends.

133
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:43,316
- It's stupid, it's stupid.
- Come on, help us help you.

134
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:44,833
Please, man.

135
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:53,719
Okay. I'm going to tell you guys
a little story.

136
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:57,953
I have never told anyone this before. Ever.

137
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:06,111
When I was 18 years old...

138
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:09,798
...my family and I were flying home...

139
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:13,555
...from a vacation we took
in the Caribbean. It was a fun time.

140
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:17,235
Very nice beaches. CJub Med.

141
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:27,151
We were in Jine to get on board...

142
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:30,676
...when I happened to gJance over
to the gate across from us...

143
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:34,799
...and that's when I saw her.

144
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:43,591
She gJowed.
It was Jike a Jight aJJ around her.

145
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:46,071
It was bJinding.

146
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:52,874
I swear I have never felt anything
that powerful before or since.

147
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:56,190
Something about her sucked me
away from the plane...

148
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:58,077
...and drew me right back to her.

149
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:01,518
There she was.

150
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:07,318
With strength I wish I still possessed...

151
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:09,550
...I floated towards her.

152
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:14,597
I introduced myself and told her how I felt.

153
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:19,079
I gave her my address...

154
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:22,357
...and told her if she felt it too,
she should write.

155
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:28,758
Young blood had him some balls.

156
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:31,753
I had no choice.
I was being driven by a higher power.

157
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:35,515
Call it "the lightning bolt,"
call it a connection, destiny, whatever.

158
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:37,750
- So did she write you?
- Not at first.

159
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:43,877
Every day I'd check that maiJbox.

160
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:46,750
I checked aJJ that summer, and nothing.

161
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:52,671
Then one day, it came.

162
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:05,150
It was more than I couJd've hoped for.
She professed her Jove to me.

163
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:07,515
She said that she, too,
got a joJt down her spine...

164
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,079
...that gJorious day we first met.

165
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:11,799
It was more beautifuJ and poetic
than she was...

166
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:14,155
...which I didn't think was possibJe
at the time.

167
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:18,192
I immediateJy wrote her back.

168
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:20,919
I toJd her that I wanted us
to run away together...

169
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:24,516
...make Jove under the stars. Make babies.

170
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:29,950
It was clear to both of us.

171
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:34,435
We belonged together.

172
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:37,872
No fear, no doubt.

173
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:41,592
- Perfect.
- Young love.

174
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:44,156
Too young. As it turned out.

175
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:54,278
ApparentJy she was an amazingJy...

176
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:56,273
...hyper-developed 11-year-old girl.

177
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:58,108
- What?
- Eleven?

178
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:00,032
Her parents found my letters and...

179
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:03,430
...quite understandably freaked out.

180
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:06,829
They contacted our JocaJ authorities...

181
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:10,276
...who swiftJy moved in to stop
the town's budding paedophiJe.

182
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:14,070
They made my father promise that
his sicko son...

183
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:16,549
...wouJd cease contact
with any more JittJe girJs.

184
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:19,438
They Jeft him to scream at me
for over an hour about...

185
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:23,479
...how I could flush any chances
of a political career down the toilet.

186
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:28,557
- That's a fucked up story, man.
- You're the only people I've ever told.

187
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:32,873
Can you keep it that way?
It makes you seem kind of creepy.

188
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:39,834
David Collins Graphics.

189
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:42,839
- Hey.
- Sarah, hey, how are you?

190
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:45,190
I just thought I'd caJJ
and see how you were.

191
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:47,874
I'm fine. How are you? How's New York?

192
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:52,397
Busy. But the city is so incredible.
I wish you were here with me. Oops, shit.

193
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:54,878
"Oops, shit," what? Why "Oops, shit"?

194
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:57,269
I made a Jist of aJJ the things
I wasn't going to...

195
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:59,715
...say to you like, "I miss you.
I wish you were here."

196
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:00,949
So how are you?

197
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:03,919
Miss you. Wish you were here, all that.

198
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:07,273
I talked to Tyler.

199
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:10,711
He and I are going to try
to get together for dinner.

200
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,831
So maybe I'll get to meet the fiancée.

201
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:15,559
Great. Be sure and thank them
for ruining my life.

202
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,958
Listen, I just wanted to let you know
that I made it here okay.

203
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:24,750
Oh. Is that it?

204
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:28,879
WeJJ, I got to get back to work.
So I shouJd go.

205
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:32,193
Yeah, me, too.

206
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,310
Okay. 'Bye, David.

207
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:49,071
I'm just saying,
it's been a week and a half now...

208
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:51,800
...and all you've done is sit around
the apartment. It's no good.

209
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:54,749
She wants me to give the situation
serious thought...

210
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:57,991
...that's exactly what I'm trying to do.
Finish it, Tiny!

211
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:01,879
And how's that working out so far?
Been doing a lot of thinking?

212
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:04,349
No! You are useless!

213
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:10,238
- What was that? He can't do that.
- Actually, I think he can.

214
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:12,478
She wants me to make
an informed decision...

215
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:13,754
...and I'm gonna respect that.

216
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:16,115
No, what she wants is for you
to wallow around your apartment...

217
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:19,829
...like some socially-retarded hermit.
Ante up. Who do you like?

218
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:23,350
- Give me $5 on Super Thong.
- I'm gonna take the one with the nice rack.

219
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:29,197
She is banking on your misery, bro,
hoping you'll sit around bumming out.

220
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:31,519
That's got to hurt.

221
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:34,478
And that, my friend,
is how you make an uninformed decision.

222
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:38,269
You want to make
a truly informed decision?

223
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:40,715
Get off your ass and
go see what it's like out there.

224
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,028
Get in the game.

225
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:45,317
The game? I.e. Hitting
the meat market clubs with you.

226
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:48,717
No. Hitting them with me and Jonesy.

227
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:54,109
There are some major fundamentaJ
probJems I have with...

228
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:56,953
..."Why buy the cow when you can get
the miJk for free?" conundrum.

229
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:02,040
For one thing, women are not cows.

230
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:05,237
And by that I mean, not so generic.

231
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:07,311
I think most reasonabJe peopJe
wouJd agree...

232
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:12,076
...that a cow is a cow is a cow.
This is not true of women.

233
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:14,037
Things might be simpJer if it were.

234
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:26,510
- Yo, Mike!
- Excuse me.

235
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,035
Scotch.

236
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:30,596
- It's packed.
- Yeah, busy.

237
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:33,950
- Thank you.
- Excuse me.

238
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:36,197
You might have offered to help me.

239
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:39,438
If you please? A beer for my friend?

240
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:43,918
Thank you.
I'm sorry to do this to you, but I got to go.

241
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:47,398
- Hey, asshole, what is your problem?
- You shouldn't drink anymore.

242
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:50,358
- Why shouldn't I? I just got here.
- Because you're driving me home.

243
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:53,637
- Oh, God.
- Oh, God.

244
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:01,551
- Hey.
- Buy you a drink?

245
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:05,076
- Actually, I'm think I'm gonna leave.
- You aren't married, are you?

246
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:07,800
- Not yet. You better hurry, though.
- Another round.

247
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:10,276
- Did Mikey show?
- Yes.

248
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:14,397
Cute. How'd he play?

249
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:18,229
Actually, I think he used the
"You're less than nothing to me" strategy.

250
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:22,351
It never fails, man.

251
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:26,672
- You miss her, huh?
- Are you kidding?

252
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:30,236
Surrounded by all these available women?
More than ever.

253
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:33,869
I know the feeling, only worse.

254
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:37,789
Imagine feeling like that in this place
without having anybody to miss.

255
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:42,075
How you doing?

256
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:46,674
You ready to go?

257
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:50,913
Okay, so you had a close encounter
with something.

258
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,911
You saw the light in the airport.

259
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:55,548
And 10 years later,
it's still messing with your head.

260
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:57,949
It was important.
It set the bar for me on some level.

261
00:16:58,040 --> 00:16:58,950
Is that so bad?

262
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:01,110
It's bad if it keeps you from hooking up
with a woman...

263
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:04,431
...who's attractive, smart,
and of legal, consenting age.

264
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:07,109
What if she's still out there?
Don't I owe it to myself...

265
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:08,189
...to try and find her?

266
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:10,111
You're hunting Sasquatch.

267
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:14,150
- See. There she is.
- The shadow lady?

268
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:16,238
She's a Sasquatch?

269
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:19,153
She's a myth. The perfect woman.

270
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:22,640
A figment of our dumb-ass
male imagination.

271
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:25,797
Slap a face on the shadow bitch,
and she ceases to be perfect...

272
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:27,799
...because she becomes real.

273
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:37,918
- So what exactly is all this crap?
- It's market research.

274
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:41,397
Insurance for the creatives who came up
with this shitty campaign.

275
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:44,030
If I can coerce a focus group...

276
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:46,111
...to say that a picture of
an anorexic model...

277
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:48,191
...bottle-feeding two large men
in diapers...

278
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:51,590
...makes them want to buy a pair of jeans,
then I've done my job.

279
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:54,035
That is a twisted way to make a living.

280
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:56,634
I know.
But at least it's the fashion biz, right?

281
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:58,597
So why don't you just move here?

282
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:03,835
- I don't know. Maybe I will.
- Who is that?

283
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:09,397
- It's Mr. Hahn. My boss.
- And you get paid?

284
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:11,038
Look at it mathematically.

285
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:15,033
If just one person hooks up with somebody
who isn't their soul mate...

286
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:18,995
...you got a chain reaction that
screws it up for everybody on the planet.

287
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:22,038
Your soul mate ends up with someone
else's who settles for someone else's...

288
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:24,270
Which makes it all the more important
to find the right person.

289
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:26,829
It's a glass-half-empty,
glass-half-full scenario.

290
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:30,037
If you ask me, the glass is half full of crap.

291
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:32,038
You sure you don't want any
late night eats?

292
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:33,792
No. I'm out of here. Take care, man.

293
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:46,910
- You got a problem?
- How's the chili?

294
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,797
I'd give my right arm for a bowl.

295
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:54,676
I'll hand that... I'll have that.

296
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:33,958
Oh, my God. My God, that was the glow.

297
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:36,509
That was the feeling you got in the airport.
It's happening again.

298
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:38,591
I'm gonna do this. Can you do this?

299
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:40,910
You've done it before,
you can do it again. Go!

300
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:45,312
I'm gonna do this. I'm gonna do this.
Can you? Can you?

301
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:47,833
Don't let her get away.

302
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:56,837
- Where did she go? Where did that girl go?
- What's your problem?

303
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:59,789
She left, crap sack.

304
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:07,075
Creep.

305
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:12,196
Wait up! Stop! Stop!

306
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:16,276
Stop! Wait up! Don't go! Don't!

307
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:30,635
Quick Match Personals. May I heJp you?

308
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:33,075
I'd like to place a personal ad.

309
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:35,549
I'm sorry, can you pJease speak up?

310
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:39,428
A personal ad.
I want to place a personal...

311
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:46,116
Hello. Is anyone there?

312
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:48,675
HeJJo?

313
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:54,111
I'm sorry. I dropped the phone. I'm here.
This is my first time.

314
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:57,713
Okay. Here goes.

315
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:02,559
Wanted...

316
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:05,871
...soul mate.

317
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:10,909
Potential soul mate looking
for his soul mate.

318
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:13,157
You, souJ-mate materiaJ.

319
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:16,118
Me, open, inteJJigent, and...

320
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:18,155
Soul-matey?

321
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:19,751
Yes.

322
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:38,634
Who's dead? Somebody better be dead.

323
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:41,188
Hey, Tyler, it's Mikey. Did I wake you?

324
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:42,395
What time is it?

325
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:44,550
It's 1:00 in the morning, 4:00 to you.
Sorry, man.

326
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:46,592
What's wrong? What happened?

327
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:49,558
- Nothing. I just wanted to talk.
- At 4:00 in the morning?

328
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:51,795
It's cheaper.

329
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:57,833
Listen, Ty, how'd you do it?

330
00:21:57,920 --> 00:22:00,753
- How'd I do what?
- How did you, you know...

331
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:03,875
How did you find somebody
who made the cut?

332
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:08,272
I don't know. It was just this
feeJing that hit me.

333
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:12,639
Like a blinding realisation, like pure truth.

334
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:19,396
- Mikey, what is this all about?
- Nothing.

335
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:23,839
Nothing. Forget it. Congratulations.

336
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:25,473
- Mike?
- Yeah?

337
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:27,630
Pull this shit again,
you don't get to be my best man.

338
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,275
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

339
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:34,190
Always a best man, never a man.

340
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:02,509
Oh, my God, this is so exciting.

341
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:04,750
I think I just met
Naomi Campbell's hair person.

342
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:07,868
So, anything I should be doing?

343
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:10,155
This is the glamorous world
of Market Research.

344
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:12,231
We just sit around
untiJ somebody wonders.

345
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:14,197
Why are those men wearing diapers?

346
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:20,760
I guess I can answer
that question for you, sir.

347
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:22,831
- You can answer that?
- Yes.

348
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,673
We did research in the Midwest
which indicated...

349
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:28,479
...that our target market was
getting younger and younger...

350
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:29,834
...as you can see.

351
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:33,231
Our focus groups taught us that
it'd be wise to do a preemptive strike...

352
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:37,154
...and showcase young imagery
in our new campaigns.

353
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:39,915
I see and this explains
why I'm spending $2 million...

354
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:43,390
...putting grown men in Huggies.
You realise if I did this in my basement...

355
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:45,596
...and post them on the internet,
I'd be arrested.

356
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:48,751
Also save a lot of money.

357
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:53,279
What are you doing for lunch?

358
00:23:56,440 --> 00:24:00,274
I'm sorry Julie couldn't make it tonight.
She really does want to meet you.

359
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:02,032
- Me, too.
- Yeah.

360
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:06,233
But at least now you can tell me
how all of this happened.

361
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:11,239
- You used to refer to marriage as...
- I know, cruel and unusual punishment.

362
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:15,998
- It's her. She just hit me like a truck.
- But you were ready for it, right?

363
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:20,039
- You were wandering around in traffic?
- Yeah, I guess it was in traffic.

364
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:23,317
I mean, if it can happen to me,
it can happen to anybody. Right?

365
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:26,553
Anybody who isn't Mike, of course.

366
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:29,874
I actually got a strange call
from Mike the other day.

367
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:32,997
I think he seemed genuinely concerned
not to have somebody in his life.

368
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:34,832
Mike, in a relationship?

369
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:36,911
Isn't that one of the signs
of the Apocalypse?

370
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,399
Nostradamus actually predicted it.

371
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:40,710
He said, in the latter part
of the twentieth century...

372
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:43,600
..."the Ione cock would crow no more."

373
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:47,635
That's scary.

374
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:50,996
Why do you think David's so reluctant
to take the next step with me?

375
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:54,079
Oh, David.

376
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:59,357
I was playing the field,
and I got burned out on it.

377
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:03,473
David hasn't exactly been out
playing the field.

378
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:08,149
- He's been playing house with me.
- A fun game.

379
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:12,511
So Jet me get this straight.

380
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:16,508
By working in a reJationship
with this guy for the past five years...

381
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:19,513
...I have actuaJJy undermined
any possibiJity of a future with him?

382
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:22,273
Yeah. Maybe. I don't know.

383
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:24,074
David's a reaJJy sharp guy...

384
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:25,878
...and I think he'JJ probabJy come
to his senses.

385
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:29,278
- I mean, you're all he wants.
- I'm all he knows.

386
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:31,794
That can work.

387
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:36,436
David, it's me.
It's Jate and you're not home.

388
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:39,398
That's good. I hope you're out having fun.

389
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:42,113
I know this sounds weird...

390
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:44,509
...but if you need to see other women
to figure this out...

391
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:45,794
...I can handJe it.

392
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:49,589
Maybe it's being here on my own
or from asking you for a decision.

393
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:52,188
I've gained a new perspective on things.

394
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:55,313
I think it's important for us to expJore
whatever options we need to.

395
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:59,234
So, if that's part of it for you
just know that I understand.

396
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:10,640
I know what you mean.
She second-guessed our move.

397
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:13,429
She's even more cunning than I thought.
She's good.

398
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:15,158
You're lucky I'm on board.

399
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:18,710
It's not like her. Why would she say it's
okay to go out with other women?

400
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:20,631
Why indeed?

401
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:29,312
Shouldn't you be out there
playing wingman for Jonesy?

402
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:30,992
Oh, please.

403
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:33,871
I never realised you were so picky.

404
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:36,429
You think I'm one of these
assy scam hounds?

405
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:38,272
I have very particular tastes.

406
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:40,555
A strict list of qualities
I look for in a woman.

407
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:43,950
I'm not just fucking around out here.
What?

408
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:45,951
Seriously, all this play I get?

409
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:50,272
I'm not wasting my time. It's practice.

410
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:55,073
- It's practice for the big game.
- Maybe it's not a game.

411
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:59,032
You've been off the circuit too long.
Of course, it's a game.

412
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:01,270
It's better than a game, it's a sport.

413
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:04,432
It's better than a sport, even.
It's sport fishing.

414
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:07,516
Case in point.

415
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:10,598
Look at him.
See those chicks he's wasting it on.

416
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:13,069
Hi, ladies! Those are bass.

417
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:16,075
And we all go bass fishing
from time to time.

418
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:19,118
Hell, you can get really good at it
with practice.

419
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:22,916
But while he's spending all his time
hooking up with bottom feeders...

420
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:26,117
...the crucial skills he'll need
to hook his wife are atrophying.

421
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:29,795
You see, scamming is like fishing.

422
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:34,669
If your dream girl were a fish,
what would she be?

423
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:38,273
- I don't know, a tuna?
- Yeah! No.

424
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:39,788
A marlin.

425
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:42,110
A big trophy fish.

426
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:44,669
To catch a marlin,
you must use entirely different skills.

427
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:48,230
You don't go out marlin fishing with
a sorry-ass fold-out pole, six-pound test.

428
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:49,639
That'll do for bass.

429
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:51,597
But it sure as shit
isn't gonna land a marlin.

430
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:55,116
You have to up your game.
Know where the elusive beauties lie.

431
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:58,158
You gotta know where to fish.
They're rare, brother. They're rare.

432
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:00,595
Most days you don't catch shit.
But when you do...

433
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:02,994
Wham!

434
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:07,113
The two of you are back
at the dock taking pictures.

435
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:09,677
Okay, another huge fJaw I have...

436
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:12,672
...with "Why buy the cow when you can
get the miJk for free?"...

437
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:14,830
...is simpJy this. MiJk is not free.

438
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:16,990
The point is,
if you're hankering for some miJk...

439
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:19,310
...one way or another,
you're gonna have to pay for it!

440
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:51,914
You digging this, Davey?
I told you I'd make it up to you.

441
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:55,356
Please point out which
of these lovely young ladies is a marlin.

442
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:57,317
We're done fishing for the day.

443
00:28:57,480 --> 00:29:01,758
We're at the aquarium now,
checking out the exotic fishies.

444
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:04,913
Look, Davey. They even got
one of those petting tanks.

445
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:07,471
Oh, my God.

446
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:10,513
I have aJready toJd him aJJ about you,
and his friend is totaJJy hot.

447
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:12,671
Sarah, come on.
You have got to get my back.

448
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:14,637
I have been after this guy
for almost a week.

449
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:17,598
They're gonna be here in an hour.
So, come on, just get my back.

450
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:21,356
I have to go. I'll do what I can. 'Bye.

451
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:25,316
- Hi.
- Hey.

452
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:28,791
Have you given any thought
to our conversation the other day?

453
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:31,235
It's all I've been thinking about.

454
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:35,234
But the problem is,
I'm involved with someone back in LA.

455
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:38,279
But I'm not sure what's happening with us.

456
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:40,749
I just need a little more time
to figure it out. Is that okay?

457
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:42,956
Of course. Just don't take too long.

458
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:02,518
Gosh, a dollar.

459
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:04,830
Now I can quit stripping,
go back to vet school...

460
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:06,558
...and save my sick pony.

461
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:11,797
Thanks, Mike. You're a prince.

462
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:14,832
- Amy!
- David, you know her!

463
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:16,399
Holy shit! It is Amy.

464
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:19,549
Give me a sec.
I have to make one last go-around.

465
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:20,789
You guys know her?

466
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:22,951
From school.
I can't believe this is happening.

467
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:26,635
- I can't believe this is happening.
- She looks great.

468
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:31,396
- She definitely lost that "Freshman 15."
- She looks hot. Damn!

469
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:34,199
Hey, you guys. How are you two?

470
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:38,478
- You work here? This is awesome.
- No, Mike, I'm just hanging.

471
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:42,314
- This is such a surprise.
- Yeah. You look good, David.

472
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:45,589
Amy, this is Jonesy. Jonesy, this is Amy.

473
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:48,435
- How you doing?
- Pleasure to meet you.

474
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:50,799
The pleasure is all mine.

475
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:54,077
Why don't you turn it down a notch?
You're channelling Barry White again.

476
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:56,515
Was she this hot when you two
were dating?

477
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:58,477
- He went out with a stripper?
- Yeah.

478
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:00,437
Actually, no.
I was just a freshman back then...

479
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:02,033
...studying to be a stripper.

480
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:05,917
David helped me bone up
on my pole-dancing exam.

481
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:07,793
Can I buy you a drink for old times' sake?

482
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:09,279
- Yeah.
- Come on.

483
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:16,317
They're going to do it.

484
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:26,229
I often wonder how long we would've
lasted if I hadn't broken up with you.

485
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:29,676
Two and a half days. I was gonna
dump you right after my last final.

486
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:32,752
I didn't have the time to get into
a big emotional thing with you.

487
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:36,910
- I had to study.
- What a relief.

488
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,513
This whole time,
I thought I broke your heart.

489
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:41,717
Give me a break. We weren't in love
or anything. We were just having fun.

490
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:45,515
- There were no expectations back then.
- Give me a hand with this.

491
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:48,998
I mean, when did that change?

492
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:52,358
It didn't. You did.

493
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:55,432
It only seems different now
because you outgrew it.

494
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:58,875
- I don't know.
- I do.

495
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:01,996
Look at your dick-with-ears friend there.

496
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:04,799
Do you think that Amy chick
would take the bid?

497
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:08,429
- I thought that was Dave's old flame.
- Key word: "was."

498
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:10,996
Damn it! I bet I could have had her.

499
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:13,150
When she was going out
with your best friend.

500
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:15,037
Yeah, that would have been real cool.

501
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:16,109
You bet.

502
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:18,914
Although, I'm sure she wasn't as hot then.

503
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:27,552
- You look unbelievable.
- Thanks.

504
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:33,070
When did it get so difficult
to figure out what I want?

505
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:35,594
If you're like most people, darlin'...

506
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:39,191
...right around the time you found
something worth wanting.

507
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:42,197
Hand me that dildo, will you?

508
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:38,239
She circled my ad.

509
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:48,198
She circled my ad!

510
00:33:57,400 --> 00:34:01,393

Hola, souJ mate.
I have searched for you for a Jong time.

515
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:18,198
I think we shouJd get together.

516
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:22,990
I have dark hair,
dark eyes and a nippJe key ring.

517
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:26,790
I'm a maid, so I have Jots of keys.

518
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:29,559
Your ad intrigued me, souJ mate.

519
00:34:29,640 --> 00:34:32,871
A JittJe about myseJf:
I Jove dressing up and getting down.

520
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:34,951
I'm a waJking contradiction...

521
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:37,031
...open-minded, yet Jactose intoJerant.

522
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:40,271
And I yearn for someone
who enjoys big surprises.

523
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:41,549
CaJJ me.

524
00:34:57,720 --> 00:35:00,917
If you'd Jike to make a caJJ,
pJease hang up and try again.

525
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:30,278
HeJJo, David.
I've been waiting for your caJJ...

526
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:32,994
...ever since I saw you
in that Mexican restaurant.

527
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:34,832
I've fantasised about us.

528
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:39,915
- Our bodies entwined and covered in saJsa.
- Salsa!

529
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:42,590
We're destined to be together, David.

530
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:46,669
- It's just like...
- Chips and salsa.

531
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:48,194
That's right.

532
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:53,156
And now... That's my other line. Hold on.

533
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:56,633
- HeJJo.
- David, it's Mike. You there? Pick up.

534
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:02,428
Come on, pick up, David.
This is important.

535
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:07,598
- Mike.
- David, it's happened to me.

536
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:11,317
Congratulations.
Look, I'm really not feeling very...

537
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:13,158
No! Listen, David.

538
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:16,153
I'm lying naked, in a strange bed...

539
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:19,959
...staring at the most beautiful woman...

540
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:22,315
...I have ever seen in my entire life.

541
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:25,514
Tell her I said, "Hi."
I've really got to go now.

542
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:29,388
She's not here.
I'm looking at her picture, okay?

543
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:33,273
Damn marlin jumped right into my boat,
caught me unawares.

544
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:34,873
What are you talking about?

545
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:38,999
That whole after-hours rave?
Complete blank.

546
00:36:39,080 --> 00:36:42,277
The last solid memory I have
was drinking some green, glowy shit...

547
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:44,430
...from a test tube
and dancing like a bastard.

548
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:45,999
- But, David...
- What?

549
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:48,429
Something magicaJ happened
in this room Jast night.

550
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:49,669
Something...

551
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:52,793
...bigger than sex.

552
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:58,515
- Although sex was definitely a factor.
- But you don't remember.

553
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:01,075
No. Last night's a totaJ bJur.
But Jisten to me.

554
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:03,435
I woke up this morning and I've got...

555
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:09,360
...the feeling.
- Is it a burning sensation?

556
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:11,636
No, David. The feeling...

557
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:14,632
...when you just know the pure,
blinding truth stuff.

558
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:16,319
I've met her, David.

559
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:20,152
For the first time in my life,
I think I'm in love. Me.

560
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:24,400
Shit. Here she comes.
Moment of truth. 'Bye.

561
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:32,832
Good morning, sunshine!

562
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:36,757
Is that for me?

563
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:40,550
Whoops. You've been, deflowered.

564
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:45,275
I can't believe you're even up
after that performance last night.

565
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:47,994
In my book,
you deserve to sleep for a week.

566
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:51,754
Hungover and clumsy.

567
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:54,752
I'll take care of that.
You just save your strength.

568
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:57,913
- The bathroom?
- What?

569
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:02,598
- The bathroom. I don't feel too well.
- It's right around the corner, lover.

570
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:08,471
You pretty boys are all the same.
Strong stamina and weak stomachs.

571
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:12,193
It's right there.

572
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:34,999
You okay in there?

573
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:39,793
This isn't happening.

574
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:42,030
- Michael?
- Just a sec!

575
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:50,911
Laura was pretty impressed
with you last night...

576
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:54,637
...even before you two started
waking the neighbourhood.

577
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:58,196
I'm into chicks. I love chicks.

578
00:38:58,760 --> 00:39:02,673
Breasts, legs, long hair.

579
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:06,509
And breasts.

580
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:09,669
I've never seen her
make breakfast for herself.

581
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:11,796
And we've been roommates
for three years.

582
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:14,599
Laura ran to the store
to get you some B12...

583
00:39:14,680 --> 00:39:16,033
...and she should be back soon.

584
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:19,192
Dad. Sit down.

585
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:24,109
I'm gay.

586
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:28,156
No! Or I was fucked up or experimenting.

587
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:30,396
You know, like Mom's college years.

588
00:39:31,640 --> 00:39:33,710
Oh, God, it is genetic.

589
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:44,270
Michael, I'll be out on the deck, okay?

590
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:47,750
When you're done, let's talk.

591
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:51,072
After what happened last night...

592
00:39:51,160 --> 00:39:53,833
...it would mean a lot to me
if we got to know each other better.

593
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:56,878
Yeah! You bet! I'll be right out!

594
00:39:58,520 --> 00:40:00,033
Jumpy little breeder.

595
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:13,876
Shit!

596
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:02,317
Stop it! You're scalding me!

597
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:22,993
Wow! That was just like Spiderman!

598
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:29,393
Actually, kid, I am Spiderman...

599
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:31,550
...and I lost my costume. I need your shirt.

600
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:32,834
Sure, Spidey.

601
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:34,992
- This is so cool.
- Yeah.

602
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:39,350
I'll give you a little hand here.

603
00:41:41,320 --> 00:41:43,595
Billy! Get away from that man!

604
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:48,276
No, no, no. Sir, I can explain.
No, it's not this.

605
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:52,478
Sir!

606
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:57,239
Sick son of a...

607
00:41:57,480 --> 00:41:59,152
No, no.

608
00:41:59,320 --> 00:42:03,233
Daddy, no. Don't shoot Spidey.
He's my special friend.

609
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:07,677
Billy! Stop, drop and roll!

610
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:10,029
Don't do it!

611
00:42:15,720 --> 00:42:17,517
Run, Spidey, run!

612
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:29,556
Okay, dog, it's Snausage time.

613
00:43:12,600 --> 00:43:14,670
This country has just gone to shit.

614
00:43:15,160 --> 00:43:17,913
Damn. Look at that little sodomite go.

615
00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:28,194
Nice work, Laura. Another asshole.

616
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:49,958
Hello, is Susan there?

617
00:43:51,360 --> 00:43:54,989
Hi, Susan. My name is David.
You answered my personal ad a couple...

618
00:43:55,960 --> 00:43:59,236
Yeah, that's the one. That's me.

619
00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:02,676
Hi, how are you?
Nice to talk to you. Listen...

620
00:44:04,040 --> 00:44:07,589
...I think we should probably
get together sometime soon.

621
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:11,232
Hi, Cynthia. How are you? David.
That's right. Soul mate guy.

622
00:44:11,320 --> 00:44:13,754
What do you say,
Papa Shan, 5:00, Tuesday?

623
00:44:14,040 --> 00:44:17,430
All right. We'll see you then.
Going to hell.

624
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:21,356
Hi, Kathleen. I got it. Tuesday, Papa Shan.

625
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:23,351
Tuesday, Papa Shan, 5:00?

626
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:24,919
I don't know. Papa Shan, 5:00, Tuesday?

627
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:37,232
Hi. Excuse me.
You aren't David by any chance, are you?

628
00:44:38,440 --> 00:44:40,237
No. No. Sorry.

629
00:44:44,080 --> 00:44:46,230
I'm going straight to hell for this.

630
00:44:47,800 --> 00:44:49,438
- David?
- It's Ralph.

631
00:44:50,440 --> 00:44:51,668
Close enough.

632
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:03,158
Sorry, I'm meeting someone.

633
00:45:04,320 --> 00:45:06,072
I have to get out of here.

634
00:45:07,480 --> 00:45:11,029
- Hi, David.
- Nicole, what are you doing in LA?

635
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:14,033
I'm in town for my cousin's bar mitzvah.
What are you doing?

636
00:45:14,120 --> 00:45:16,350
I'm leaving.

637
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:20,912
This place is such a meat market.
It's a total singles scene.

638
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:24,595
- Did you just call him David?
- Yeah. That is his name.

639
00:45:24,680 --> 00:45:27,114
It's my nickname.
My close friends call me that.

640
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:31,239
- David, what are you talking about?
- Who the hell has David for a nickname?

641
00:45:32,200 --> 00:45:35,749
I do. It's short for Davidian.
Branch Davidian.

642
00:45:36,360 --> 00:45:40,148
- Are you here to meet a David, too?
- Yeah. Who are you?

643
00:45:40,280 --> 00:45:42,874
Did you answer an ad in
Quick Match PersonaJs?

644
00:45:43,480 --> 00:45:46,233
- David, do you know these women?
- You son of a...

645
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:48,392
Soul mate, my ass!

646
00:45:57,640 --> 00:45:58,959
Stop it, please!

647
00:46:00,080 --> 00:46:02,469
Excuse me, I'm supposed to meet
someone here named...

648
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:06,872
Some shit monkey invited four women
from the same dating service!

649
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:08,313
Why? Why?

650
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:10,550
Look, just get down here, all right?

651
00:46:10,640 --> 00:46:13,234
And send ambulances, lots of them.

652
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:15,719
I'm sorry!

653
00:46:16,360 --> 00:46:21,434
I'm sorry! I've been a bad boy! I'm sorry!

654
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:23,911
How does it look? Is it bad?

655
00:46:26,680 --> 00:46:30,958
No. You're good.
So, we're about the same age.

656
00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:34,032
Tell me, how does one develop
such intense hatred for women...

657
00:46:34,120 --> 00:46:35,394
...in a short amount of time?

658
00:46:35,480 --> 00:46:38,040
Publicly humiliating four women
you've never met before?

659
00:46:38,120 --> 00:46:40,509
I thought maybe I had met
one of them before.

660
00:46:40,600 --> 00:46:41,749
I was wrong.

661
00:46:43,520 --> 00:46:47,274
Go ahead, call Sarah.
Rat my miserable ass out.

662
00:46:50,200 --> 00:46:51,269
Forget it.

663
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:55,434
I'd lash out at an entire gender too
if I had your problems.

664
00:46:55,520 --> 00:46:56,873
It must be tough.

665
00:46:59,320 --> 00:47:02,790
You're the last person I would have
expected sympathy from on all this.

666
00:47:03,040 --> 00:47:06,077
It can't be easy. Especially now.

667
00:47:07,600 --> 00:47:09,158
What do you mean, now?

668
00:47:11,720 --> 00:47:13,551
Maybe you'd better call her.

669
00:47:20,440 --> 00:47:21,793
Sarah, pick up the damn...

670
00:47:21,880 --> 00:47:24,110
- HeJJo.
- Hello, Sarah?

671
00:47:24,320 --> 00:47:27,471
This is Amber. I work with Sarah.
Can I take a message?

672
00:47:27,840 --> 00:47:29,319
I need to know where she is.

673
00:47:29,400 --> 00:47:31,994
She Jeft a JittJe earJy today.
Had a dinner engagement.

674
00:47:32,080 --> 00:47:33,274
An appointment.

675
00:47:33,960 --> 00:47:35,757
- With who?
- Who is this?

676
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:38,677
This is her boyfriend, David.

677
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:41,633
I didn't know she had a boyfriend.

678
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:43,513
She does.

679
00:47:44,040 --> 00:47:46,508
Listen, I'm sorry.
I really don't know who you are...

680
00:47:46,600 --> 00:47:49,160
...but I'd appreciate it
if you told me who she was...

681
00:47:49,240 --> 00:47:52,391
She's out with Andrew. Mr. Hahn.

682
00:47:54,640 --> 00:47:56,790
- Mr. Hung?
- Yeah, the big guy.

683
00:47:59,560 --> 00:48:01,118
Are you sure you're her boyfriend?

684
00:48:02,440 --> 00:48:05,955
I mean, she knows that you're
her boyfriend and everything right?

685
00:48:27,120 --> 00:48:29,190
So how long have you been married?

686
00:48:30,120 --> 00:48:33,476
- Seven years.
- Must be nice to have that kind of security.

687
00:48:34,200 --> 00:48:36,509
I'm the poster boy for happily married.

688
00:48:37,400 --> 00:48:39,789
But security,
that's a rare thing these days...

689
00:48:39,880 --> 00:48:41,154
...especially in marriage.

690
00:48:41,240 --> 00:48:43,913
That's a sombre outlook for
the happily-married, poster boy.

691
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:45,831
Fifty percent divorce rate in the CUS.

692
00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:48,878
The only security you have
in this world is yourself.

693
00:48:49,200 --> 00:48:52,078
The point I'm making, Sarah,
is your talent is yours alone.

694
00:48:52,160 --> 00:48:55,596
And you do have talent, Sarah.
Your designs are amazing.

695
00:48:56,840 --> 00:48:59,991
Only you can decide what you want to do
with that talent.

696
00:49:01,600 --> 00:49:03,909
- I just wish it were simpler.
- Simpler?

697
00:49:04,840 --> 00:49:07,718
I'm offering you a job in New York
doing what you love doing.

698
00:49:07,800 --> 00:49:10,598
I know. And it's a dream come true.

699
00:49:11,160 --> 00:49:13,594
Dreams don't come true very often.

700
00:49:16,200 --> 00:49:18,395
Maybe it's not supposed to be simple.

701
00:49:30,240 --> 00:49:33,676
Bellissimo. Magnifico.

702
00:49:35,600 --> 00:49:37,158
Mike, it's me. Where you been, man?

703
00:49:37,280 --> 00:49:39,748
I haven't heard from you since
you met your true Jove.

704
00:49:40,520 --> 00:49:41,794
I've reaJJy got to taJk to you.

705
00:49:41,880 --> 00:49:45,668
So why don't you just pick up the phone
and give me a caJJ between orgasms, okay?

706
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:24,560
From the makers of the hit videos,
Are You Gay? ...

707
00:50:24,640 --> 00:50:26,676
...and So You Think You're Gay...

708
00:50:26,760 --> 00:50:29,069
...United HomosexuaJ Headquarters

709
00:50:29,200 --> 00:50:31,350
...Just How Gay Are You?

710
00:50:38,480 --> 00:50:40,550
HeJJo. I'm Tim Chadway...

711
00:50:40,640 --> 00:50:43,200
...President of United HomosexuaJ
Headquarters.

712
00:50:43,640 --> 00:50:45,232
My buddies caJJ me Timbo.

713
00:50:45,320 --> 00:50:47,038
You know, Jike miJJions of Americans...

714
00:50:47,120 --> 00:50:50,157
...you're probabJy wondering just
how gay are you?

715
00:50:50,320 --> 00:50:51,878
That's an important question.

716
00:50:51,960 --> 00:50:54,758
But, come on,
the answer is pretty obvious, isn't it?

717
00:50:56,160 --> 00:50:57,513
Face it, chief.

718
00:50:57,600 --> 00:51:01,229
If you're watching me now,
you are pretty damn gay.

719
00:51:01,880 --> 00:51:03,074
But that's okay.

720
00:51:03,160 --> 00:51:05,515
Because, you see,
here at the Headquarters...

721
00:51:05,600 --> 00:51:08,558
...we speciaJise in making your
journey out of the cJoset...

722
00:51:08,640 --> 00:51:10,517
...as smooth as possibJe.

723
00:51:10,600 --> 00:51:12,830
From our handy Gay Pride Starter Kit...

724
00:51:12,920 --> 00:51:15,388
...to those convenient,
"I'm here, I'm queer...

725
00:51:15,480 --> 00:51:20,110
"...stop by sometime for a beer"

726
00:51:20,200 --> 00:51:22,555
...you'JJ be out and about in no time.

727
00:51:22,640 --> 00:51:24,471
Your famiJy and friends wiJJ admire you...

728
00:51:24,560 --> 00:51:28,235
...for your abiJity to make that transition
with styJe and fJair.

729
00:51:39,120 --> 00:51:42,317
- I still can't believe it.
- Why don't you just call her?

730
00:51:42,480 --> 00:51:44,471
You don't even know for sure
what's going on.

731
00:51:44,560 --> 00:51:46,596
If she wants to talk, she can give me a call.

732
00:51:46,680 --> 00:51:48,398
I'm done sitting around like a sucker.

733
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:51,199
- You got to stop being hard on yourself.
- Mike was right.

734
00:51:51,280 --> 00:51:54,750
If I'm gonna make an informed decision,
it's time I started getting busy.

735
00:51:55,760 --> 00:51:59,196
Wait a minute. What's this bar
that Mike wants us to meet him at?

736
00:52:01,440 --> 00:52:02,714
"The Cock Pit."

737
00:52:03,920 --> 00:52:06,992
You might want to wait till tomorrow night
to start getting busy.

738
00:52:07,080 --> 00:52:08,354
Why is that?

739
00:52:10,640 --> 00:52:12,949
Because tonight,
we're drinking in Boys' Town.

740
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:16,514
A lot of guys claim they
practically knew it in the womb.

741
00:52:16,600 --> 00:52:17,999
Like something was wrong...

742
00:52:18,080 --> 00:52:20,878
...they felt different than all
the other fetuses.

743
00:52:21,200 --> 00:52:22,679
How did you figure it out?

744
00:52:22,760 --> 00:52:24,990
After a string of girlfriends...

745
00:52:25,080 --> 00:52:27,514
...a couple ex-wives,
and a Great Dane or two...

746
00:52:27,600 --> 00:52:29,955
...I started thinking, "Hey, maybe it's me."

747
00:52:31,240 --> 00:52:33,515
- Was that difficult for you?
- Sure.

748
00:52:33,600 --> 00:52:38,037
Most terrifying thing that you can do
is look inside yourself carefully, honestly.

749
00:52:38,120 --> 00:52:39,951
But you have to do it, Michael.

750
00:52:40,040 --> 00:52:43,396
And when I did,
it was a feeling that just hit me.

751
00:52:43,800 --> 00:52:47,156
A blinding realisation like pure truth.

752
00:52:48,600 --> 00:52:51,990
- Mike, what's up?
- Guys, hey! Sit down.

753
00:52:53,520 --> 00:52:55,909
- Are you aware that this is a...
- A gay bar?

754
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:58,639
It's okay to say it. And yes, I know.

755
00:52:58,840 --> 00:53:01,400
But I like it, I think.

756
00:53:02,720 --> 00:53:06,633
I'm trying to, anyway.
Stanley! A beer for my friends, please.

757
00:53:08,640 --> 00:53:10,631
- I get it. I get it.
- You do?

758
00:53:10,720 --> 00:53:14,076
He's trying to go the distance
with that chick he met at After Hours.

759
00:53:14,160 --> 00:53:16,594
Right. Avoiding places that
tempt you to stray...

760
00:53:16,680 --> 00:53:18,477
...off the gilded path of monogamy.

761
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:21,792
I can't wait to meet this girl.
She must really be something.

762
00:53:21,880 --> 00:53:23,359
She didn't...

763
00:53:24,800 --> 00:53:27,837
...turn out to be the person
I thought she was.

764
00:53:29,600 --> 00:53:33,434
- Sorry, man.
- I'm sorry. She sounded different.

765
00:53:33,840 --> 00:53:35,831
Let's just drop it, okay?

766
00:53:37,680 --> 00:53:39,910
So what's up with this bar?

767
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:42,514
This isn't really our kind of place.

768
00:53:43,600 --> 00:53:47,912
What do you mean?
It's got beer. It's got bar stools.

769
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:51,037
- What more do you need, Jonesy?
- How about women?

770
00:53:51,760 --> 00:53:53,159
I'm shocked.

771
00:53:53,320 --> 00:53:55,880
I never would have pegged you two
as homophobes.

772
00:53:55,960 --> 00:53:59,589
What the hell do you guys have
against gay people, anyway?

773
00:54:00,280 --> 00:54:03,829
We've got nothing against gays.
Some of my best friends' friends are gay.

774
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:05,433
That's right.

775
00:54:18,600 --> 00:54:20,431
- Holy shit.
- What's that?

776
00:54:20,520 --> 00:54:23,318
The Mikey Chronicles, man.
The Sacred Scam Scrolls.

777
00:54:23,680 --> 00:54:25,079
This is the black book?

778
00:54:25,160 --> 00:54:27,720
I want you to have it, David.
I don't need it anymore.

779
00:54:27,880 --> 00:54:30,917
Look at all these numbers.
What are these little black diamonds?

780
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:33,673
Stick to the blue squares.
I'd hate to see you get hurt.

781
00:54:33,760 --> 00:54:35,273
This is bigger than I thought.

782
00:54:35,360 --> 00:54:38,716
That chick must have really snuck up
from behind and nailed you.

783
00:54:52,840 --> 00:54:53,716
David?

784
00:54:53,800 --> 00:54:55,756
You must be Nikki.
I hope I'm not too early.

785
00:54:55,840 --> 00:54:57,751
- So you're a friend of Mike's?
- Yeah.

786
00:55:01,280 --> 00:55:03,111
David, Mike owes me $200.

787
00:55:04,040 --> 00:55:04,995
Is cash okay?

788
00:55:15,200 --> 00:55:16,155
Hi.

789
00:55:17,760 --> 00:55:19,034
Come on in.

790
00:55:54,400 --> 00:55:56,311
David. What are you doing here?

791
00:56:00,320 --> 00:56:04,518
If you're this upset, then why has
it taken you two weeks to call me back?

792
00:56:04,600 --> 00:56:06,955
I've been busy.

793
00:56:07,080 --> 00:56:09,036
Never mind that. Who's this guy?

794
00:56:09,160 --> 00:56:12,357
He's my boss. And all he did was
offer me a new position.

795
00:56:12,440 --> 00:56:15,796
What's the matter, our old positions
aren't good enough for you anymore?

796
00:56:15,880 --> 00:56:17,279
As a designer.

797
00:56:17,360 --> 00:56:20,750
He wants an answer,
but I told him I had to talk to you first.

798
00:56:20,840 --> 00:56:22,717
This is about more than a job offer.

799
00:56:22,800 --> 00:56:24,995
You tell me to explore,
to meet other women.

800
00:56:25,080 --> 00:56:26,593
That's got nothing to do with this.

801
00:56:26,680 --> 00:56:29,319
I can't make a decision until I know
all the variables...

802
00:56:29,400 --> 00:56:31,311
...one of which is still in your hands.

803
00:56:31,600 --> 00:56:33,511
Great. So now I'm just a variable.

804
00:56:35,680 --> 00:56:38,717
This has just gotten more complicated.

805
00:56:40,400 --> 00:56:43,710
Why don't you just admit it?
You love it there.

806
00:56:43,800 --> 00:56:47,315
You don't want to say no to this offer
and I'm not going to be a reason you do.

807
00:56:47,400 --> 00:56:51,552
Look, if you already have made up
your mind, then say so.

808
00:56:52,240 --> 00:56:54,879
But don't try to hide behind
some noble gesture...

809
00:56:54,960 --> 00:56:56,359
...of not holding me back.

810
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:58,638
Why don't we be fair here?

811
00:56:58,720 --> 00:57:01,837
Things have changed, Sarah.
This is no longer just my decision.

812
00:57:01,920 --> 00:57:04,718
You're right, it isn't.
And that's why I'm coming home early.

813
00:57:05,680 --> 00:57:06,590
What?

814
00:57:06,680 --> 00:57:08,955
They're paying for me
to come home and taJk to you.

815
00:57:09,040 --> 00:57:10,598
They reaJJy want me, David.

816
00:57:10,680 --> 00:57:12,557
Possibly more than you do.

817
00:57:21,920 --> 00:57:23,831
Oh, shit.

818
00:57:34,080 --> 00:57:35,433
Dave!

819
00:57:40,200 --> 00:57:43,192
What's up, man?
De-bachelorising for the little lady.

820
00:57:43,280 --> 00:57:46,272
She gets back today. What's up?
You didn't get me a coffee?

821
00:57:46,360 --> 00:57:47,759
I didn't know how you took it.

822
00:57:47,840 --> 00:57:50,115
But here, I grabbed your mail
on the way in.

823
00:57:50,200 --> 00:57:51,599
So what's the verdict?

824
00:57:51,680 --> 00:57:54,478
I get to comb the thrift stores
for a new, used suit or what?

825
00:57:54,560 --> 00:57:57,358
Not yet. I'm just as confused as ever.

826
00:58:13,800 --> 00:58:15,233
Are you all right?

827
00:58:16,800 --> 00:58:18,950
- Just lock up when you leave.
- What?

828
00:58:28,080 --> 00:58:29,957
I wasn't sure if you'd be here.

829
00:58:30,040 --> 00:58:32,395
I'm here. Where else would I be?

830
00:58:33,760 --> 00:58:36,274
- What's this?
- I'm going to New York.

831
00:58:39,920 --> 00:58:40,909
What?

832
00:58:43,360 --> 00:58:45,351
- What?
- There's somebody I got to see.

833
00:58:45,440 --> 00:58:48,398
- What are you talking about?
- Options, remember? Just in case.

834
00:58:48,560 --> 00:58:49,834
You're out of options!

835
00:58:49,920 --> 00:58:52,878
This means staying here or going back.
These are your options.

836
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:55,195
- Sarah.
- No, listen.

837
00:58:55,400 --> 00:58:58,517
Listen to me carefully.
I flew back here for one reason...

838
00:58:58,600 --> 00:59:02,434
...and that was to give you a chance
to talk me out of taking this job.

839
00:59:02,880 --> 00:59:05,189
I can't do that until I do this.

840
00:59:07,280 --> 00:59:10,909
I won't be here when you get back.
I swear to God, I won't.

841
00:59:11,960 --> 00:59:13,632
This is it, David.

842
00:59:15,200 --> 00:59:16,553
I know.

843
00:59:28,720 --> 00:59:32,554
There are times in Jife when you have
to make extremeJy difficuJt choices.

844
00:59:32,960 --> 00:59:36,555
And there are times when it seems Jike
you don't have a choice at aJJ.

845
00:59:36,640 --> 00:59:38,278
Like those rare moments...

846
00:59:38,360 --> 00:59:41,750
...when your onJy option practicaJJy
shows up in your maiJbox.

847
00:59:50,640 --> 00:59:52,198
- David!
- Tyler.

848
00:59:54,040 --> 00:59:55,473
I'm psyched you're here.

849
00:59:55,560 --> 00:59:58,028
- You look great.
- It really means a lot to me.

850
00:59:58,560 --> 01:00:01,677
- So what the hell are you doing here?
- I know it's sudden.

851
01:00:01,760 --> 01:00:03,318
I just wanted to see you.

852
01:00:03,400 --> 01:00:06,631
Things are gonna start getting crazy
for you and Julie.

853
01:00:06,840 --> 01:00:09,718
And I wanted to see you. Both of you.

854
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:11,956
I talked to Sarah, you know.

855
01:00:12,120 --> 01:00:15,112
She said that you guys met up
when she was in town.

856
01:00:15,520 --> 01:00:18,318
No. I talked to her about three hours ago.

857
01:00:18,400 --> 01:00:20,994
She called,
while you were in the air, from LA.

858
01:00:21,680 --> 01:00:25,036
- She's freaking out.
- Everything's fine.

859
01:00:25,120 --> 01:00:27,839
I know what you're going through.
It's a scary leap.

860
01:00:27,920 --> 01:00:30,229
The trick is you have to let go
of your fears...

861
01:00:30,320 --> 01:00:32,880
...and just kind of go for it.

862
01:00:33,760 --> 01:00:37,196
Believe me, the worst thing you can do
is lose the right girl...

863
01:00:37,280 --> 01:00:38,838
...because of a fear of commitment.

864
01:00:38,920 --> 01:00:41,309
The worst thing you can do
is marry the wrong girl...

865
01:00:41,400 --> 01:00:42,958
...because of a fear of Ioneliness.

866
01:00:47,120 --> 01:00:50,317
I can't wait for you to meet her.
I've told her all about you.

867
01:00:50,400 --> 01:00:51,230
You have?

868
01:00:51,320 --> 01:00:54,039
Yeah. I told her about all you guys.
I had to warn her.

869
01:00:54,120 --> 01:00:56,680
Even my name?
You didn't mention my name.

870
01:00:57,920 --> 01:00:59,911
No, of course not your name.

871
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:03,197
We refer to you all by your general nature,
like the Indians.

872
01:01:03,280 --> 01:01:04,713
Mike is "Fucks Whatever Moves."

873
01:01:04,800 --> 01:01:06,597
You're
"Dances Around Major Life Decisions."

874
01:01:06,680 --> 01:01:08,796
What'd she say,
when you mentioned my name?

875
01:01:09,080 --> 01:01:10,832
- What is wrong with you?
- I'm sorry.

876
01:01:11,440 --> 01:01:14,398
What would she possibly say about...
Oh, there she is.

877
01:01:37,080 --> 01:01:39,116
This is David. David, this is Julie.

878
01:01:39,200 --> 01:01:42,510
So nice to finally meet you.
I feel like I already know you.

879
01:01:42,880 --> 01:01:45,553
- I feel the same way.
- Isn't she beautiful?

880
01:01:45,680 --> 01:01:48,240
You look like I did first time
I laid eyes on her.

881
01:01:48,520 --> 01:01:49,873
I just knew right away.

882
01:01:49,960 --> 01:01:52,155
It hit me like a blinding realisation, like...

883
01:01:52,240 --> 01:01:53,593
Pure truth.

884
01:01:54,920 --> 01:01:56,478
Was he always this sappy?

885
01:01:56,560 --> 01:01:59,836
- Since I met you, baby.
- Will you order me a drink?

886
01:02:00,240 --> 01:02:02,754
I'm going to go to the ladies' room.
Excuse me.

887
01:02:09,680 --> 01:02:13,639
Now you know, buddy.
Now you understand.

888
01:02:50,560 --> 01:02:53,358
That's it. This guy Jeff works
at Tyler's firm...

889
01:02:53,640 --> 01:02:55,676
...knew my roommate,
and they hooked us up.

890
01:02:55,760 --> 01:02:57,159
End of story.

891
01:02:58,400 --> 01:03:02,109
That's... Wow, what a story.

892
01:03:03,280 --> 01:03:05,669
The important thing is
that you ended up together?

893
01:03:06,080 --> 01:03:06,990
Yeah.

894
01:03:07,080 --> 01:03:09,719
I mean, think of all the people
you've met in your lives.

895
01:03:09,800 --> 01:03:11,950
All the paths taken, not taken.

896
01:03:12,480 --> 01:03:16,075
You can probably trace back to
your very first romantic memory.

897
01:03:16,840 --> 01:03:19,991
- Lf you tried.
- Oh, yeah. Fifth grade drama class.

898
01:03:20,920 --> 01:03:24,913
Miss Liska had us lie on the ground
and pretend we were driftwood.

899
01:03:25,160 --> 01:03:27,469
And then as she walked
around the "beach"...

900
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:30,753
...she would step over us...
- We get it.

901
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:32,274
That's nice, sweetie.

902
01:03:34,560 --> 01:03:36,232
What about you, Julie?

903
01:03:40,800 --> 01:03:42,631
Oh, no. The airport guy?

904
01:03:42,720 --> 01:03:46,952
The airport guy?
What about the airport guy?

905
01:03:47,040 --> 01:03:50,669
- Tell me about this airport guy.
- It's okay, honey.

906
01:03:50,840 --> 01:03:52,432
He's a friend.

907
01:03:57,480 --> 01:03:58,629
Okay.

908
01:04:00,360 --> 01:04:04,035
I was travelling with my family once.

909
01:04:04,200 --> 01:04:05,599
We were in an airport...

910
01:04:05,760 --> 01:04:08,991
...and this guy came up to me
from out of nowhere.

911
01:04:12,680 --> 01:04:15,877
And he started,
saying aJJ these strange things to me...

912
01:04:15,960 --> 01:04:18,315
...about how he feJt something
when he saw me...

913
01:04:18,400 --> 01:04:20,311
...and he wondered if I feJt it, too.

914
01:04:20,400 --> 01:04:23,198
I didn't know what to say,
so I just kind of smiJed at him.

915
01:04:23,280 --> 01:04:24,679
He gave me his address...

916
01:04:24,760 --> 01:04:27,320
...and asked, if I feJt the same
I shouJd write him.

917
01:04:27,400 --> 01:04:30,597
And as he waJked away,
I had this frozen grin on my face.

918
01:04:30,760 --> 01:04:33,593
I didn't want to agitate him or anything.

919
01:04:33,760 --> 01:04:36,194
I was terrified
that he was going to hurt me.

920
01:04:36,480 --> 01:04:38,835
Can you believe that?
How old were you, honey?

921
01:04:38,920 --> 01:04:40,876
- Eleven.
- Eleven years old.

922
01:04:40,960 --> 01:04:43,190
If that son of a bitch
were here right now...

923
01:04:43,280 --> 01:04:44,508
But you wrote him!

924
01:04:45,560 --> 01:04:50,270
I mean, did you ever write him?

925
01:04:50,440 --> 01:04:53,318
No. Of course not.

926
01:04:57,760 --> 01:05:00,479
Honey, do you want me to finish the story
for you?

927
01:05:00,560 --> 01:05:02,152
- There's more?
- Yeah.

928
01:05:02,240 --> 01:05:04,993
No, it's okay. I can do this.

929
01:05:06,080 --> 01:05:09,834
So as soon as the guy was gone
I threw the address away.

930
01:05:10,760 --> 01:05:14,230
But what I didn't know at the
time was that my JittJe sister Katie...

931
01:05:14,520 --> 01:05:16,875
...who was two years younger than me...

932
01:05:17,360 --> 01:05:19,999
...saw everything.

933
01:05:23,120 --> 01:05:24,917
She wanted to be Jike me.

934
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:29,630
She worshipped me
and she started writing this creep, as me.

935
01:05:30,800 --> 01:05:33,075
She even sent him my picture.

936
01:05:33,160 --> 01:05:35,549
Then, of course, when he wrote back...

937
01:05:35,720 --> 01:05:38,871
...weird stuff about how
he wanted to run away with her...

938
01:05:38,960 --> 01:05:40,188
...and make babies.

939
01:05:40,280 --> 01:05:42,316
Can you imagine that? Make babies?

940
01:05:42,400 --> 01:05:44,914
And this is before the Internet.
What a sicko.

941
01:05:45,440 --> 01:05:47,715
- I'm sorry, honey. Are you all right?
- But...

942
01:05:49,920 --> 01:05:52,275
...did you ever find out who this guy was?

943
01:05:52,960 --> 01:05:54,837
My parents did.

944
01:05:55,080 --> 01:05:56,308
Sort of.

945
01:05:56,480 --> 01:06:00,075
They overheard Katie
bragging to me about her boyfriend.

946
01:06:00,200 --> 01:06:01,792
She had mentioned it before...

947
01:06:01,920 --> 01:06:05,310
...so we just assumed it was
this imaginary pJay friend or something.

948
01:06:05,400 --> 01:06:09,154
But when she started teJJing me about how
he'd promised to run away with her...

949
01:06:09,240 --> 01:06:11,310
...and make Jove to her...

950
01:06:11,440 --> 01:06:13,476
- CUnder the stars.
...they stepped in.

951
01:06:14,400 --> 01:06:16,118
She was only nine.

952
01:06:17,320 --> 01:06:19,515
So my dad called the authorities...

953
01:06:20,440 --> 01:06:22,271
...gave them the guy's address...

954
01:06:22,360 --> 01:06:25,591
...and, as was his style,
told us to forget the whole thing!

955
01:06:27,040 --> 01:06:28,951
It wasn't until years later...

956
01:06:29,120 --> 01:06:32,669
...that I realized the guy
thought he was writing me.

957
01:06:33,040 --> 01:06:36,350
And then I pieced it together,
and I remembered the airport incident.

958
01:06:36,600 --> 01:06:37,953
But I never told anyone.

959
01:06:43,120 --> 01:06:44,394
I have to go.

960
01:06:45,800 --> 01:06:48,234
- Are you all right?
- Where are you going?

961
01:06:48,640 --> 01:06:51,200
I have to... Thank you for the...

962
01:06:52,840 --> 01:06:55,752
Congratulations with... Good-bye.

963
01:07:02,760 --> 01:07:04,034
I'd seen the Jight.

964
01:07:04,200 --> 01:07:07,556
It was this gJaringJy-obvious,
bJind reaJisation...

965
01:07:07,840 --> 01:07:09,034
...Jike pure truth.

966
01:07:09,120 --> 01:07:13,238
And it was not about anyone in particuJar,
but about peopJe in generaJ.

967
01:07:14,440 --> 01:07:18,911
I reaJised at that moment
there is no such thing as "the one."

968
01:07:19,080 --> 01:07:22,755
It's more of a mind-boggJing,
whoJe heJJ of a Jot of potentiaJ ones.

969
01:07:22,920 --> 01:07:26,913
And whiJe that shouJd be comforting,
it was actuaJJy pretty terrifying.

970
01:07:27,840 --> 01:07:30,752
We'd aJJ Jike to kick back
and wait for some magicaJ force...

971
01:07:30,840 --> 01:07:33,752
...to show us who we shouJd spend
the rest of our Jives with.

972
01:07:33,840 --> 01:07:34,955
But the truth is...

973
01:07:35,040 --> 01:07:37,873
...there isn't a Jightning boJt
to sJap you on the ass...

974
01:07:37,960 --> 01:07:40,679
...and teJJ you to pick
this person over aJJ others.

975
01:07:40,760 --> 01:07:43,069
If anything, it's Jike the rain.

976
01:07:44,360 --> 01:07:46,078
Rain faJJs aJJ the time.

977
01:07:46,160 --> 01:07:48,958
Sometimes you're prepared for it,
sometimes you're not.

978
01:07:49,040 --> 01:07:52,919
Depending where you are when it hits
you either get caught or you don't.

979
01:07:53,480 --> 01:07:56,950
In fact, most of us usuaJJy try Jike heJJ
to avoid it.

980
01:07:58,280 --> 01:08:00,635
You might miss the bus.
You might catch the bus.

981
01:08:00,720 --> 01:08:03,473
Maybe you remembered your umbreJJa,
maybe you didn't.

982
01:08:03,840 --> 01:08:05,319
No big signs.

983
01:08:05,400 --> 01:08:08,517
Just random,
torrentiaJ bursts of opportunity.

984
01:08:09,960 --> 01:08:13,589
And that's the most fate can do.
The rest is up to us.

985
01:08:14,200 --> 01:08:16,714
And now, by the power vested in me...

986
01:08:17,920 --> 01:08:20,832
...I now pronounce you husband and wife.

987
01:08:22,240 --> 01:08:23,639
You may kiss the bride.

988
01:09:04,360 --> 01:09:07,670
So the eternal bachelor
was the first one to go.

989
01:09:07,760 --> 01:09:10,194
I don't think I'll ever understand men.

990
01:09:12,680 --> 01:09:15,114
- You look amazing.
- Thanks.

991
01:09:16,200 --> 01:09:18,395
I'm very happy for you. I mean it.

992
01:09:19,400 --> 01:09:20,833
Thanks.

993
01:09:21,080 --> 01:09:23,275
I had a tough time for those
first few months.

994
01:09:23,360 --> 01:09:24,509
It was really hard.

995
01:09:24,600 --> 01:09:27,194
But then I had to take Nicole
to the emergency room...

996
01:09:27,320 --> 01:09:30,357
...to get her stomach pumped again
and there he was.

997
01:09:31,560 --> 01:09:32,834
Our eyes just met...

998
01:09:32,920 --> 01:09:37,391
...and it was like
this indescribable feeling like...

999
01:09:37,480 --> 01:09:40,438
I get it. Not that happy yet.

1000
01:09:45,320 --> 01:09:47,959
It's terrific you found someone
who deserves you.

1001
01:09:49,520 --> 01:09:53,229
But I'd be lying
if I said I didn't miss our friendship.

1002
01:10:22,760 --> 01:10:26,116
Okay. I think it's time
to stir things up on the dance floor.

1003
01:10:26,320 --> 01:10:27,230
Join me?

1004
01:10:27,320 --> 01:10:30,198
I think I'll pass.
I didn't bring any singles with me.

1005
01:10:30,920 --> 01:10:31,955
Joke.

1006
01:10:32,080 --> 01:10:35,629
Please remember there are
impressionable children out there.

1007
01:10:35,720 --> 01:10:37,756
- Let's keep it PG-13.
- No problem.

1008
01:10:38,080 --> 01:10:39,638
Hand me that dildo, will you?

1009
01:10:44,080 --> 01:10:45,149
- Amy.
- Yeah.

1010
01:10:45,240 --> 01:10:48,357
- Haven't seen her since college.
- She's great.

1011
01:10:48,920 --> 01:10:52,879
- You two...
- No. We're just friends.

1012
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:59,231
I saw that goofy-Iooking bastard
that Sarah's with.

1013
01:10:59,320 --> 01:11:03,472
That guy, he's like missing
a chromosome or something.

1014
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:06,912
- What a freak.
- We both know he's an attractive guy.

1015
01:11:08,200 --> 01:11:09,553
But, thank you for trying.

1016
01:11:11,920 --> 01:11:13,876
I bet he's no brain surgeon.

1017
01:11:15,760 --> 01:11:17,034
Shit. Really?

1018
01:11:18,560 --> 01:11:20,039
There you are.

1019
01:11:21,040 --> 01:11:22,393
Baby, you remember David.

1020
01:11:22,520 --> 01:11:24,988
You met him at the restaurant
a couple months ago.

1021
01:11:25,080 --> 01:11:27,310
Glad you didn't have to rush out
early today.

1022
01:11:27,960 --> 01:11:29,473
It was a beautiful ceremony.

1023
01:11:29,560 --> 01:11:32,358
Thank you. I'm just glad
my little sister got to catch the end.

1024
01:11:32,440 --> 01:11:34,476
Katie showed up? Honey, that's great.

1025
01:11:34,560 --> 01:11:36,994
I didn't think she would make it.
What happened?

1026
01:11:37,080 --> 01:11:38,991
- Your sister is here?
- Yeah.

1027
01:11:39,440 --> 01:11:43,319
But she doesn't like weddings.
She never got over that airport guy.

1028
01:11:43,400 --> 01:11:45,960
- The paedophile, the sicko.
- Asshole.

1029
01:11:46,120 --> 01:11:47,792
Honey, settle down.

1030
01:11:48,760 --> 01:11:51,069
You know I should really
introduce you two.

1031
01:11:51,920 --> 01:11:54,354
- You would totally hit it off.
- What a great idea.

1032
01:11:54,440 --> 01:11:57,750
- Why don't you go get her?
- No, no. That's not necessary.

1033
01:11:58,120 --> 01:12:02,193
- Virgin. Hot.
- I think I see her. Stay here.

1034
01:12:02,280 --> 01:12:03,474
I'll be right back.

1035
01:12:03,560 --> 01:12:07,473
What's the matter? You look like you did
the night at the restaurant when you...

1036
01:12:07,560 --> 01:12:08,675
I have to go.

1037
01:12:09,160 --> 01:12:10,275
...bolted.

1038
01:12:29,280 --> 01:12:32,352
- Lightning Taxi.
- Hi. I need a cab. Fast.

1039
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:37,912
Ladies and gentJemen at this time,
Mike Hanson, the best man...

1040
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:40,560
...wouJd Jike to make a toast
to JuJie and TyJer.

1041
01:12:43,800 --> 01:12:45,233
AJJ right, thank you.

1042
01:12:46,360 --> 01:12:48,191
Thank you.

1043
01:12:53,800 --> 01:12:55,313
Many of you don't know me...

1044
01:12:55,400 --> 01:12:59,791
...but I had the pJeasure of being...

1045
01:13:00,440 --> 01:13:03,034
...TyJer's roommate
in our fraternity house at schooJ.

1046
01:13:03,120 --> 01:13:07,955
Yeah, you were! Phi Lamb!
Who's my boy, Mikey? You're my boy!

1047
01:13:09,720 --> 01:13:12,757
And today I have the priviJege...

1048
01:13:13,720 --> 01:13:15,995
...of being the best man in his wedding.

1049
01:13:16,440 --> 01:13:20,877
Suffice it to say, I was shocked
to hear that he was getting married.

1050
01:13:21,320 --> 01:13:24,835
But over time as I taJked to him
on the phone...

1051
01:13:25,760 --> 01:13:27,113
...I began to understand.

1052
01:13:27,200 --> 01:13:30,476
We used to do everything together.
We were joined at the hip.

1053
01:13:30,560 --> 01:13:33,279
It struck me that
what these two peopJe were doing...

1054
01:13:33,360 --> 01:13:35,954
...was giving themseJves in to...

1055
01:13:37,440 --> 01:13:39,317
...a bJinding reaJisation.

1056
01:13:40,160 --> 01:13:41,434
Pure truth.

1057
01:13:42,160 --> 01:13:46,676
They stood before everyone they knew
and confessed their new found seJves.

1058
01:13:46,760 --> 01:13:50,435
I don't know,
but witnessing such strength...

1059
01:13:50,600 --> 01:13:52,830
...and courage in my friends...

1060
01:13:53,360 --> 01:13:56,158
...inspires me in a way
which I can bareJy put into words.

1061
01:14:02,120 --> 01:14:05,430
You see, whiJe many of you
don't know me...

1062
01:14:05,800 --> 01:14:07,836
...the rest of you onJy think you do.

1063
01:14:08,120 --> 01:14:11,317
The truth is you're about to meet
Mike Hanson for the first time.

1064
01:14:13,720 --> 01:14:15,631
My name is Mike Hanson...

1065
01:14:16,760 --> 01:14:18,512
...and I'm a raging homosexuaJ.

1066
01:14:24,800 --> 01:14:26,358
Thank you.

1067
01:14:30,360 --> 01:14:32,920
I didn't really know him that well.

1068
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:38,117
And Jet's give it up to the newJyweds.
Congrats, guys.

1069
01:14:46,960 --> 01:14:48,518
Hit it.

1070
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:03,560
Why does everybody keep trying
to set me up?

1071
01:15:03,720 --> 01:15:05,676
They're never him.

1072
01:15:05,840 --> 01:15:07,956
Katie, please come out and meet him.

1073
01:15:18,240 --> 01:15:20,151
You look amazing.

1074
01:15:21,720 --> 01:15:24,393
All right, let's go meet this guy.

1075
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:31,831
Ladies! There you are!

1076
01:15:32,360 --> 01:15:35,397
- Katie, I'm so glad that you could make it.
- Thank you.

1077
01:15:36,200 --> 01:15:39,237
- We have to go. The limo is here.
- Wait. Have you seen David?

1078
01:15:40,120 --> 01:15:43,715
No. I think he left with Mike and Amy
because I haven't seen them, either.

1079
01:15:43,800 --> 01:15:46,030
But you know what?
We should forget about them.

1080
01:15:46,120 --> 01:15:48,554
I'm gonna meet you up front.
We really have to go.

1081
01:15:49,160 --> 01:15:51,754
- It's okay. You just go.
- No. You're coming with us.

1082
01:15:51,840 --> 01:15:54,673
No. It's your day. Don't worry about me.
I'll be fine.

1083
01:15:54,760 --> 01:15:57,149
- Are you sure?
- Positive. Just go, all right?

1084
01:15:57,240 --> 01:15:58,992
- Love you.
- Love you, too.

1085
01:16:03,120 --> 01:16:05,793
So, I don't mean to belittle
your big announcement...

1086
01:16:05,880 --> 01:16:08,269
...but come on, Mike,
you never even worked retail.

1087
01:16:08,520 --> 01:16:09,839
It makes sense.

1088
01:16:09,920 --> 01:16:13,674
All my life I've treated women like dirt,
never letting them get too close...

1089
01:16:13,760 --> 01:16:15,478
...just using and cruising.

1090
01:16:16,240 --> 01:16:18,515
That doesn't make you a homosexual.

1091
01:16:18,920 --> 01:16:20,831
It makes you an asshole.

1092
01:16:31,160 --> 01:16:35,039
- Excuse me, are you waiting for someone?
- No, I'm not waiting, I'm not waiting.

1093
01:16:35,200 --> 01:16:37,430
Wait a minute, that's my cab! That's my...

1094
01:17:01,800 --> 01:17:03,597
These insolent swine!

1095
01:17:03,960 --> 01:17:06,997
They call you and they tell you
to come right away. Big hurry!

1096
01:17:07,080 --> 01:17:08,752
And you come, they're not there.

1097
01:17:19,040 --> 01:17:21,600
And I feel like...
How do you say, "assholes"?

1098
01:17:21,680 --> 01:17:23,033
Yeah, I know the feeling.

1099
01:17:24,400 --> 01:17:27,392
You know the feeling?
Do you know the feeling?

1100
01:17:33,560 --> 01:17:35,869
So it was nice wedding, yes?

1101
01:17:37,400 --> 01:17:39,197
No, not again!

1102
01:17:41,880 --> 01:17:42,756
My God!

1103
01:17:43,600 --> 01:17:45,079
No, no. Please get up.

1104
01:17:49,640 --> 01:17:51,232
Are you all right?

1105
01:18:06,320 --> 01:18:08,436
It's you.

1106
01:18:10,280 --> 01:18:12,840
I have been looking everywhere for you.

1107
01:18:16,920 --> 01:18:18,638
What took you so long?

1108
01:18:34,280 --> 01:18:36,953
I feel all tingly inside.

1109
01:18:37,560 --> 01:18:39,869
I know. So do I.

1110
01:18:40,400 --> 01:18:42,356
No, in a scary way.

1111
01:18:45,040 --> 01:18:47,918
Right. We should get you to a hospital.

1112
01:19:10,040 --> 01:19:11,632
What are you doing?

1113
01:19:12,200 --> 01:19:13,792
You said you were gay.

1114
01:19:13,880 --> 01:19:15,393
Yeah, and your point is?
