1
00:01:10,291 --> 00:01:13,625
Hang on! Hang in there!

2
00:01:14,666 --> 00:01:15,708
Stay with me!

3
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,665
You’re gonna get yourself killed,
Sergeant. Just drop me and go!

4
00:01:18,666 --> 00:01:19,916
Oh hell no!

5
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:23,500
Medic! Man down!

6
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:57,707
Matt! Hey, you’re really
gonna ignore me

7
00:02:57,708 --> 00:02:59,333
when I’m speaking directly to you?

8
00:03:00,166 --> 00:03:01,458
Do you at least have it on you?

9
00:03:04,541 --> 00:03:07,625
Look, you get disability, what’re
you doing living on the streets, okay?

10
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,720
- You don’t know I’m
on the streets, do you?

11
00:03:09,791 --> 00:03:10,958
- Well, where else are you?

12
00:03:11,333 --> 00:03:12,875
- Well, I’m not, all right?

13
00:03:13,083 --> 00:03:14,874
- Well, what are you doing
around here all the time?

14
00:03:14,875 --> 00:03:17,582
- I’m just here for pay day. I could
change my mailing address

15
00:03:17,583 --> 00:03:19,583
but it’d be a hassle, you know?

16
00:03:20,041 --> 00:03:23,416
- I don’t want you to change
your address, just...

17
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:26,291
at least it helps us to...

18
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:28,458
- Helps us to what, Matt?

19
00:03:28,459 --> 00:03:31,541
- I don’t know! Look, I gotta go in there,
I gotta do payroll, okay?

20
00:03:32,666 --> 00:03:34,166
See you around, Gabe.

21
00:03:59,083 --> 00:04:01,333
- I don’t deserve you.

22
00:04:02,125 --> 00:04:04,000
You know you’re too good to me.

23
00:04:05,375 --> 00:04:07,625
- I’m my own women’s movement.

24
00:04:10,291 --> 00:04:11,958
I learned it from your mother.

25
00:04:14,625 --> 00:04:19,750
- She thinks old men are
little boys with whiskers.

26
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:23,250
- She’s right.

27
00:04:25,166 --> 00:04:26,707
And wrong.

28
00:04:30,291 --> 00:04:32,666
And somewhere in between.

29
00:04:40,707 --> 00:04:45,332
- We have been in the middle
of nowhere for far too long.

30
00:04:48,332 --> 00:04:50,500
- I just want to make sure you’re okay.

31
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:05,166
- Twenty-two missed calls from Mo. Hi Mo.

32
00:05:20,707 --> 00:05:24,125
Ba-agalau-vizman kariv, v'imru. Amen.

33
00:05:24,332 --> 00:05:25,541
- Amen!

34
00:05:26,416 --> 00:05:29,041
- There’s nothing worse than a mother
having to bury her child.

35
00:05:30,082 --> 00:05:33,500
And here in my hands, I hold the departed...

36
00:05:37,041 --> 00:05:38,125
Just a moment, please.

37
00:05:45,791 --> 00:05:50,375
Molly Herskovitz has asked me to read her
account of Barney’s final moments.

38
00:05:56,166 --> 00:05:58,624
- “My Barney loved romping
with his school-chums"

39
00:05:58,625 --> 00:06:01,041
"in the whitewater of Long Island Sound.”

40
00:06:02,208 --> 00:06:04,582
“He was on his way home
from the beach one day"

41
00:06:04,583 --> 00:06:07,999
"and just as he arrived,
I happened to look out the window"

42
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:13,000
"to see a giant flock of herring gulls
swoop down from the sky"

43
00:06:13,416 --> 00:06:15,791
"to peck and ravage my poor Barney.”

44
00:06:16,875 --> 00:06:19,957
“I watched in horror as they
lifted him up off the ground"

45
00:06:20,166 --> 00:06:21,625
"feasting on his flesh."

46
00:06:22,625 --> 00:06:26,500
"I knew I had to save him
from those flying... birds"

47
00:06:27,582 --> 00:06:31,125
"so I rushed outside in my robe,
hoping to scare them away"

48
00:06:31,625 --> 00:06:32,832
"but I was too late."

49
00:06:33,416 --> 00:06:37,207
"My little babushka had gotten out
through a hole in the screen door."

50
00:06:37,791 --> 00:06:40,375
"The one I meant to fix after 9/11."

51
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,165
"Anyhow they carried most of him
out to sea"

52
00:06:43,166 --> 00:06:48,582
"though I was able to save
a hind leg and and microchip.”

53
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:00,875
- I thought you loved dogs.

54
00:07:02,583 --> 00:07:03,583
- I do.

55
00:07:04,333 --> 00:07:08,000
But what I saw today transcended…
everything.

56
00:07:09,041 --> 00:07:13,416
- Well, I got paid seven hundred dollars,
in advance, thank God,

57
00:07:13,958 --> 00:07:15,625
for that little canine kaddish.

58
00:07:15,958 --> 00:07:17,838
- I would’ve buried the urn
next to the husband.

59
00:07:17,957 --> 00:07:19,457
- You can’t bury an inked Jew.

60
00:07:20,791 --> 00:07:22,750
Barney had an ID tattoo.

61
00:07:23,082 --> 00:07:24,582
- So many rules.

62
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:27,625
No wonder guilt runs so rampant
with you people.

63
00:07:27,791 --> 00:07:30,457
- “You people”.
Always with the “you people”.

64
00:07:31,707 --> 00:07:34,666
You do realize you’re going to have
to start saying “our people”?

65
00:07:35,707 --> 00:07:36,707
- Is that so?

66
00:07:36,957 --> 00:07:39,707
- What’s the tally of no-no’s
you never said no to?

67
00:07:43,166 --> 00:07:45,000
- I rarely say no to you.

68
00:07:45,291 --> 00:07:47,082
- Only to the big ticket items.

69
00:07:49,707 --> 00:07:51,166
- Not to converting.

70
00:07:52,207 --> 00:07:55,041
- Yeah? And it’s a very big deal.

71
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:04,333
Wait, wait, Jesus!

72
00:08:04,625 --> 00:08:06,750
- What? Just working up some cardio.

73
00:08:07,041 --> 00:08:08,333
- No shit.

74
00:08:10,916 --> 00:08:13,041
- Why are Jewish boys so good in bed?

75
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,125
- Maybe we’re grateful for the
opportunity.

76
00:09:32,083 --> 00:09:33,333
- Last call, Simon.

77
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:36,290
- One more for the road.

78
00:09:37,290 --> 00:09:38,540
- You live across the street.

79
00:09:40,875 --> 00:09:43,375
- Did you know Johnny Walker
works as a stool softener?

80
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:45,708
- So that’s what
he’s been doing up there.

81
00:09:54,125 --> 00:09:55,665
- Excuse me, can I get a selfie?

82
00:09:58,083 --> 00:09:59,083
Thanks.

83
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:08,916
- Nope. No.

84
00:10:12,958 --> 00:10:14,166
Come on in, Mary.

85
00:10:15,791 --> 00:10:16,916
- How’d you know it was me?

86
00:10:17,416 --> 00:10:19,666
- Actors always let them know
when you’re coming.

87
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:22,708
- Hi baby.

88
00:10:22,708 --> 00:10:23,666
- How was the show tonight?

89
00:10:23,667 --> 00:10:25,833
- Fine, except my understudy
gave my notice.

90
00:10:26,208 --> 00:10:27,208
- Hmm.

91
00:10:30,666 --> 00:10:33,665
Nobody can literally live up
to most of this stuff.

92
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:35,250
- For instance?

93
00:10:35,458 --> 00:10:37,040
- You can’t touch the skin of a pig.

94
00:10:37,458 --> 00:10:38,750
So what, no Super Bowl?

95
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:41,039
- It says...

96
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:44,458
You can’t mix colors of thread
under penalty of stoning.

97
00:10:44,790 --> 00:10:46,333
- Betsy Ross, what a whore.

98
00:10:46,875 --> 00:10:47,875
- Right?

99
00:10:50,083 --> 00:10:52,875
Sorry, excuse me, baby.
Can’t find...

100
00:10:53,415 --> 00:10:54,415
Ah.

101
00:11:01,458 --> 00:11:04,833
“Wherefore I will yet plead with you,
sayeth the Lord,"

102
00:11:05,083 --> 00:11:07,583
"and your children’s children
will I plead.”

103
00:11:08,541 --> 00:11:11,458
I mean, how do you
translate this stuff?

104
00:11:17,458 --> 00:11:18,458
- Hey man.

105
00:11:20,208 --> 00:11:21,875
Got a few bucks for food?

106
00:11:22,125 --> 00:11:25,791
- For food? Yeah right,
you’re in front of a bar.

107
00:11:27,083 --> 00:11:28,291
- Book by its cover, man.

108
00:11:29,416 --> 00:11:30,583
Then again, so are you.

109
00:11:32,208 --> 00:11:33,875
I know you’re not that much of a dick.

110
00:11:34,208 --> 00:11:35,333
- You’re wrong.

111
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:39,875
- Then again, you wouldn’t
last a day in my shoes.

112
00:11:48,875 --> 00:11:50,290
- Yo, anybody in there?

113
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:57,665
- Dog doesn’t pay you enough for what
some broads are doing in there.

114
00:12:05,375 --> 00:12:06,750
- Hey, excuse me?

115
00:12:15,916 --> 00:12:16,916
Hey.

116
00:12:16,958 --> 00:12:18,375
- What’s the other guy look like?

117
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,125
- Not as bad as the guy who needs a drink.

118
00:12:28,958 --> 00:12:31,625
It’s 2:30. Last call.

119
00:12:34,375 --> 00:12:36,583
Come in with me, I do their books.

120
00:12:41,333 --> 00:12:43,708
You're good.

121
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,208
- Yo Matt.

122
00:12:48,625 --> 00:12:49,708
- I finished your taxes.

123
00:12:51,083 --> 00:12:52,458
- Am I getting anything back?

124
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:55,540
- Oh, uh, make yourself at home.
- Thanks.

125
00:12:56,165 --> 00:12:58,083
Oh, where’s the head?

126
00:12:58,625 --> 00:12:59,625
- Over there.

127
00:13:04,625 --> 00:13:06,166
- I’ll watch it for you.

128
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:08,750
- Thanks.

129
00:13:09,333 --> 00:13:10,958
- I’m too old for you.

130
00:13:11,458 --> 00:13:12,916
- Oh, sorry, ma’am.

131
00:13:13,666 --> 00:13:15,791
- I’m not chopped liver either

132
00:13:16,166 --> 00:13:19,166
and you look like hell
for a very good reason.

133
00:14:14,250 --> 00:14:15,416
- Oh my God.

134
00:14:16,458 --> 00:14:17,958
- It’s not as bad as it looks.

135
00:14:18,208 --> 00:14:21,250
- Yeah, that’s… worse.

136
00:14:23,291 --> 00:14:24,958
Is there anything I can do?

137
00:14:25,625 --> 00:14:26,958
- Yeah, you can get out.

138
00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:30,291
Get out!

139
00:14:39,375 --> 00:14:40,915
- Hey, boss!

140
00:14:41,375 --> 00:14:42,540
- Hey Joe.

141
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:45,332
- I thought you got a soap.

142
00:14:45,333 --> 00:14:46,664
- I did. Two days.

143
00:14:46,665 --> 00:14:47,874
- Hey, that’s great, right?

144
00:14:47,875 --> 00:14:50,249
- Day number one I was Short Cop ♫2

145
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:52,833
day number two I was
Short Homeless Guy #1.

146
00:14:53,165 --> 00:14:55,750
I make more pimping out Mo
for bargain brisses.

147
00:15:07,125 --> 00:15:09,457
- So tell me, what happened?

148
00:15:09,458 --> 00:15:11,290
You get schmeissed
from the Garden of Eden?

149
00:15:11,291 --> 00:15:13,791
- I don’t know what that means,
and I know everything.

150
00:15:14,708 --> 00:15:16,124
- I keep telling you, if you fall short,

151
00:15:16,125 --> 00:15:17,750
you’re gonna get your ass kicked again.

152
00:15:18,333 --> 00:15:21,041
- Yeah. Matt doing payroll?

153
00:15:22,375 --> 00:15:23,416
- Yeah.

154
00:15:24,666 --> 00:15:26,916
So tell me, how was your trip?

155
00:15:27,166 --> 00:15:31,500
- Fantastic. Hot sun, sand,
clear blue water,

156
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:33,665
girl with a little something extra.

157
00:15:34,165 --> 00:15:36,375
- Good. Great.

158
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:39,125
But I need you back here, bro.

159
00:15:40,208 --> 00:15:41,208
- Yeah.

160
00:15:42,915 --> 00:15:45,540
Well, how about some hoops?

161
00:15:46,125 --> 00:15:47,290
- We got the guys?

162
00:15:47,790 --> 00:15:49,290
- Yeah, no, I don’t know.

163
00:15:52,375 --> 00:15:54,125
Hi, I’m Jess.

164
00:15:55,290 --> 00:15:56,708
- I’ll alert the media.

165
00:15:58,250 --> 00:15:59,833
- Don’t just stand there, judge me.

166
00:16:01,833 --> 00:16:03,958
- I’m a lover, not a judger.

167
00:16:04,708 --> 00:16:05,708
- Uh huh.

168
00:16:06,333 --> 00:16:08,133
And how much trouble
has that gotten you into?

169
00:16:08,791 --> 00:16:12,958
- A lot. That’s why I had to get away.

170
00:16:13,958 --> 00:16:15,125
- I dunno, man.

171
00:16:17,083 --> 00:16:19,625
I think you leaving whenever
the hell you feel like it

172
00:16:20,041 --> 00:16:22,000
tells me that you can’t be counted on.

173
00:16:24,291 --> 00:16:25,708
- Is that how it’s gonna be now?

174
00:16:26,666 --> 00:16:27,875
- Look.

175
00:16:29,250 --> 00:16:31,833
Whatever it is I was going through,

176
00:16:33,083 --> 00:16:34,625
Maggie got me through it.

177
00:16:35,625 --> 00:16:36,915
- I want to believe that.

178
00:16:38,833 --> 00:16:40,040
I really do.

179
00:16:48,125 --> 00:16:49,583
I’m worried about you, Jess.

180
00:16:53,415 --> 00:16:55,165
- You just can’t help yourself, can you?

181
00:16:56,040 --> 00:17:00,666
You always have to make my problems
your problem.

182
00:17:01,250 --> 00:17:02,250
- Yes.

183
00:17:03,333 --> 00:17:04,333
I do.

184
00:17:05,125 --> 00:17:06,375
I’m your brother.

185
00:17:09,333 --> 00:17:11,415
And I will always have your back.

186
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:15,083
And what’s in front too.

187
00:17:18,958 --> 00:17:20,375
Do you understand?

188
00:17:24,083 --> 00:17:25,290
- Yes.

189
00:17:36,291 --> 00:17:38,091
- That’s what makes us
a great team, you know.

190
00:17:40,166 --> 00:17:41,666
For better or worse.

191
00:18:06,125 --> 00:18:08,750
- All right, last call, coming up.

192
00:18:09,166 --> 00:18:10,166
- Again?

193
00:18:10,541 --> 00:18:13,375
- There’s the door.
Or what can we get you?

194
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,375
- What do you suggest?

195
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,290
- I make the best ten dollar Gibsons in
the Tri-State area.

196
00:18:18,291 --> 00:18:19,083
- All right.

197
00:18:19,084 --> 00:18:20,250
- Gin or vodka?

198
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:23,083
- Vodka. Gin’s depressing.

199
00:18:24,125 --> 00:18:27,125
- No, we don’t want that now, do we, Eli?

200
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,250
- Do I know you?

201
00:18:32,541 --> 00:18:35,041
- I’m hurt. You don’t remember me?

202
00:18:37,125 --> 00:18:41,208
Jess, 54 Below, couple years back.

203
00:18:42,583 --> 00:18:44,375
- I was doing a lot of shit back then.

204
00:18:44,541 --> 00:18:45,781
- So that you could’ve met God?

205
00:18:49,375 --> 00:18:50,750
You got a case for that fiddle?

206
00:18:51,125 --> 00:18:52,457
- Yeah, but I was in a hurry.

207
00:18:52,458 --> 00:18:56,166
- Hey, I’m up for the role of
Short Junkie #3 on SVU.

208
00:18:57,041 --> 00:18:58,500
- I’m a short junkie.

209
00:19:01,958 --> 00:19:03,458
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

210
00:19:03,791 --> 00:19:06,500
- It’s a good one.
As God is my witness.

211
00:19:09,208 --> 00:19:10,291
- So, uh...

212
00:19:11,875 --> 00:19:14,666
I don’t suppose there was any way
at all that you could’ve ducked?

213
00:19:19,666 --> 00:19:20,666
- Dad.

214
00:19:21,083 --> 00:19:23,500
- Ah, you’re back.

215
00:19:25,250 --> 00:19:26,250
- Yeah.

216
00:19:32,291 --> 00:19:34,958
- This guy Thoreau was an agnostic.

217
00:19:36,416 --> 00:19:38,165
- Yeah, there’s a lot of that
going around, Dad.

218
00:19:38,166 --> 00:19:39,458
You got us a dive bar.

219
00:19:39,916 --> 00:19:43,666
- It’s really not. You and Mo like
to romanticize alcoholism.

220
00:19:44,125 --> 00:19:46,833
- Yeah. Keeping the faith is
white-washing.

221
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:49,291
- Hey Jess? Wait a minute, wait.

222
00:19:50,083 --> 00:19:51,250
Come listen.

223
00:19:51,958 --> 00:19:53,041

228
00:20:08,375 --> 00:20:10,250
It’s not that different from Latin, Dad.

229
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,374
You remember when you used to
take me to the Metropolitan Opera

230
00:20:15,375 --> 00:20:16,416
when I was little?

231
00:20:18,166 --> 00:20:21,750
- The original building was a grand
structure. It’s gone now.

232
00:20:24,541 --> 00:20:27,040
- Yeah, but we sat so high.
- Yeah.

233
00:20:27,041 --> 00:20:28,333
Third balcony?

234
00:20:29,333 --> 00:20:31,250
Because we couldn’t afford better tickets.

235

But I still heard every note. Every lyric.

You and me. Every Tuesday.

237
00:20:44,416 --> 00:20:48,625
We’d watch Verdi, Puccini, Wagner,
and this one by Mozart.

238
00:20:49,625 --> 00:20:54,750
And I would cry, and one time
you asked me, “Why?”

239
00:20:55,458 --> 00:20:56,458
What’d I say?

240
00:20:59,083 --> 00:21:01,041
- “Mozart speaks my language.”

241
00:21:03,083 --> 00:21:05,125

What’s his story?

276
00:24:29,250 --> 00:24:30,333
- I don’t know yet.

277
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,207

281
00:24:44,916 --> 00:24:47,540
Wowing them for a year
in Hillary: The Musical.

282
00:24:47,541 --> 00:24:49,290
- And she comes to this dive bar?

283
00:24:49,291 --> 00:24:51,040
- Hey, if you were playing that
woman eight times a week,

284
00:24:51,041 --> 00:24:52,333
you’d come here too.

285
00:24:52,791 --> 00:24:54,191
- This is the best bar in New York.

286
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:58,708
Been around for decades,
original owners, everyone’s family.

287
00:24:59,166 --> 00:25:01,916
- I’m Mary, I gave birth to the bartender.

288
00:25:02,833 --> 00:25:03,791
- Nice to meet you, ma’am.

289
00:25:03,792 --> 00:25:05,291
- Simon, mind if I join you?

290
00:25:05,708 --> 00:25:08,707
- Sure, although I wasn’t counting
on any positivity tonight.

291
00:25:08,708 --> 00:25:10,832
- Oh don’t fret. I’m sure
you’ll figure out a way

292
00:25:10,833 --> 00:25:12,958
to lower that bar you have
inside your head.

293
00:25:14,291 --> 00:25:16,458
- This is my third martini
and I don’t feel a thing.

294
00:25:17,416 --> 00:25:19,040
- Things kick in when they’re supposed to...

295
00:25:19,041 --> 00:25:20,041
- Hey!

296
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:22,083
Your Gibson’s kinda weak!

297
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:23,625
- Let’s take care of that.

298
00:25:24,291 --> 00:25:27,833
- It’s straight Stoli, pal.
Sip it, you’ll feel it.

299
00:25:33,833 --> 00:25:37,083
- Beautiful instrument. Yours?
- Um-hmm.

300
00:25:37,791 --> 00:25:38,911
- How long you been married?

301
00:25:40,333 --> 00:25:43,583
- Three years. Can’t get out of it.

302
00:25:43,875 --> 00:25:45,416
You know what, that drink’s fine.

303
00:25:49,333 --> 00:25:50,333
- Who hit him?

304
00:26:00,750 --> 00:26:02,030
- So what happened to your back?

305
00:26:04,208 --> 00:26:05,833
- Your plumber’s got a big mouth.

306
00:26:06,416 --> 00:26:07,500
- Yeah, we’re family here.

307
00:26:08,333 --> 00:26:10,041
But Stevie Wonder could see your welts.

308
00:26:12,375 --> 00:26:14,250
- Not everyone comes in
for the perks.

309
00:26:14,541 --> 00:26:15,666
- Sure they do.

310
00:26:15,833 --> 00:26:19,541
- I love this place, kid. You know why?

311
00:26:22,041 --> 00:26:24,916
I can sit in my corner,
I can drink when I’m thirsty,

312
00:26:25,875 --> 00:26:27,916
I can nurse myself when I’m hungover,

313
00:26:28,250 --> 00:26:31,041
I can write, and I can wallow

314
00:26:32,041 --> 00:26:33,125
by myself.

315
00:26:35,166 --> 00:26:38,208
I’m not sad, I just like looking that way.

316
00:26:41,041 --> 00:26:43,624
And you leave me alone because
we’re cut from the same cloth

317
00:26:43,625 --> 00:26:45,916
and no one has to know but you and me.

318
00:26:51,458 --> 00:26:52,875
They’re a match made in heaven.

319
00:26:55,541 --> 00:26:57,125
- Yeah, that worked out
well for me.

320
00:27:28,791 --> 00:27:30,625
- You pick the shittiest places to hide.

321
00:27:32,166 --> 00:27:35,041
- I’m not hiding,
‘cause nobody’s looking.

322
00:27:36,916 --> 00:27:38,250
See, not even you.

323
00:27:39,166 --> 00:27:40,166
- Where’s your sponsor?

324
00:27:41,458 --> 00:27:42,875
- Six feet under.

325
00:27:43,333 --> 00:27:44,666
He blew his brains out.

326
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:47,250
But he was sober though, so…

327
00:27:48,250 --> 00:27:50,000
maybe if he’d had a hit
or something, huh?

328
00:27:55,791 --> 00:27:56,791
- Oops.

329
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,125
- What a waste.

330
00:28:07,291 --> 00:28:08,750
- No, it’s fine, it’s right here.

331
00:28:10,583 --> 00:28:11,916
Oh, you meant me.

332
00:28:13,375 --> 00:28:16,458
C’mon, Mo, stay. Give your shit a shot.

333
00:28:18,666 --> 00:28:20,083
- How can I look up to you?

334
00:28:22,083 --> 00:28:23,083
Huh?

335
00:28:23,625 --> 00:28:27,541
- Fuck me, is that what I’m here for?

336
00:28:27,625 --> 00:28:28,666
- I thought so.

337
00:28:28,833 --> 00:28:30,500
- Yeah, that’s pressure I can’t handle.

338
00:28:33,583 --> 00:28:34,833
Sorry.

339
00:28:48,125 --> 00:28:49,416
- Did you want me to stop you?

340
00:28:50,125 --> 00:28:51,166
- Probably.

341
00:28:54,375 --> 00:28:56,333
But I’m not disappointed that you didn’t.

342
00:28:59,041 --> 00:29:00,041
- Of course not.

343
00:29:03,791 --> 00:29:05,375
You know I’m gonna cover for you.

344
00:29:06,625 --> 00:29:08,125
- Hooray.

345
00:29:11,333 --> 00:29:12,875
I just started again.

346
00:29:14,166 --> 00:29:15,708
And I can stop again too.

347
00:29:16,833 --> 00:29:17,833
Believe me.

348
00:29:18,208 --> 00:29:19,833
I swear to God...

349
00:29:20,083 --> 00:29:21,125
- Don’t do that.

350
00:29:22,666 --> 00:29:24,750
Just… don’t do that.

351
00:29:26,750 --> 00:29:28,125
It belittles us both.

352
00:29:35,750 --> 00:29:37,625
- I bought this place for my sons

353
00:29:37,875 --> 00:29:39,416
and they named it after me.

354
00:29:40,541 --> 00:29:43,208
- Dog. It’s a nickname, right?

355
00:29:45,625 --> 00:29:46,958
- Nothing gets past you.

356
00:29:49,291 --> 00:29:51,666
You had enough?
- No.

357
00:29:52,291 --> 00:29:54,041
The more I drink the less I feel.

358
00:29:54,333 --> 00:29:55,708
- Is that the point?

359
00:29:56,416 --> 00:29:57,791
- Things hurt less.

360
00:30:03,250 --> 00:30:04,625
Do I have to go?

361
00:30:04,875 --> 00:30:06,708
- Well, last call was last call.

362
00:30:08,916 --> 00:30:10,166
- Hey, what’s your play about?

363
00:30:12,333 --> 00:30:13,625
- Dry divers.

364
00:30:14,625 --> 00:30:15,625
You know, like, uh...

365
00:30:16,916 --> 00:30:19,458
Ahhhhh, splat.

366
00:30:19,750 --> 00:30:21,707
- No change of heart
on the way down

367
00:30:21,708 --> 00:30:22,832
you know what I mean?

368
00:30:22,833 --> 00:30:24,582
- The other day I asked my ex-wife

369
00:30:24,583 --> 00:30:26,415
if she thought the world
would be a better place

370
00:30:26,416 --> 00:30:27,541
without me in it.

371
00:30:30,458 --> 00:30:32,166
I wasn’t a great husband.

372
00:30:35,250 --> 00:30:37,291
The question made her cry.

373
00:30:40,083 --> 00:30:41,583
Why is that, you think?

374
00:30:42,583 --> 00:30:43,583
- Well…

375
00:30:45,416 --> 00:30:46,875
maybe because you asked, and

376
00:30:48,458 --> 00:30:49,708
you’d thought about it.

377
00:30:51,125 --> 00:30:52,125
- Oh.

378
00:30:52,875 --> 00:30:53,958
- It happens to men.

379
00:30:55,458 --> 00:30:57,500
- What happened to you, he means.

380
00:30:59,583 --> 00:31:01,291
- I should’ve ordered shots.

381
00:31:01,958 --> 00:31:04,625
- Dog sometimes bends the rules, but...

382
00:31:05,375 --> 00:31:06,665
you're not driving.

383
00:31:06,666 --> 00:31:07,541
- Are they mine?

384
00:31:07,541 --> 00:31:08,541
- Sleight of hand.

385
00:31:08,750 --> 00:31:10,957
- Jess wouldn’t serve you another
unless you gave them up.

386
00:31:10,958 --> 00:31:12,166
- I didn’t give them up.

387
00:31:12,416 --> 00:31:13,416
- Whoops.

388
00:31:13,791 --> 00:31:15,499
- Well, let’s just say you did.

389
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:16,666
I mean, what’s the big deal?

390
00:31:18,250 --> 00:31:19,291
- Thanks, babe.

391
00:31:20,208 --> 00:31:21,583
- You two together?

392
00:31:22,583 --> 00:31:24,291
- All four of them are in love.

393
00:31:26,458 --> 00:31:28,125
Yeah, I don’t wanna know about that.

394
00:31:32,416 --> 00:31:33,750
- Play something.

395
00:31:36,208 --> 00:31:38,166
What would you do with this guy, Mo?

396
00:31:39,208 --> 00:31:41,528
- Get him to do something
with his hands that doesn’t hurt.

397
00:31:57,250 --> 00:31:58,791
- I didn’t twist his arm.

398
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,250
- Can I hand it off?

399
00:32:12,166 --> 00:32:13,500
- I’m counting on it.

400
00:32:27,166 --> 00:32:28,166
- Jesus!

401
00:32:34,166 --> 00:32:35,286
- You're out of here, buddy!

402
00:32:36,750 --> 00:32:37,666
- Let him go, Matt.

403
00:32:37,667 --> 00:32:39,624
- Look at your face,
someone ought to kick your ass.

404
00:32:39,625 --> 00:32:41,500
- You picked a bad night to call me out!

405
00:32:42,166 --> 00:32:43,166
- Let’s see!

406
00:32:44,833 --> 00:32:46,166
- What are you looking at?!

407
00:32:46,625 --> 00:32:48,416
- Dummy, I was moved, I had to write!

408
00:32:49,583 --> 00:32:51,833
And I almost broke through. This much.

409
00:32:52,833 --> 00:32:54,374
In my world, above my head,

410
00:32:54,375 --> 00:32:56,291
a lightbulb only needs to be this small.

411
00:32:57,958 --> 00:33:00,958
An idea at a quarter to three
is what I live for.

412
00:33:02,666 --> 00:33:05,875
- Your music, what you’re doing
to that punched-out face of yours…

413
00:33:08,333 --> 00:33:10,375
suck it up and get a drink.

414
00:33:51,833 --> 00:33:53,125
- I, uh...

415
00:33:56,208 --> 00:33:57,458
I gotta be somewhere.

416
00:33:58,041 --> 00:33:59,333
- It’s good for you to be here.

417
00:34:02,375 --> 00:34:03,791
- You play a mean violin.

418
00:34:05,916 --> 00:34:07,375
- I hate that adjective.

419
00:34:07,875 --> 00:34:09,375
- Depends on the context, right?

420
00:34:10,458 --> 00:34:12,375
- It shouldn’t, mean is mean.

421
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,875
- It’s not supposed to happen to guys.

422
00:34:17,291 --> 00:34:18,625
- A woman did that to you?

423
00:34:19,916 --> 00:34:22,541
- When wives beat their husbands,
no one wants to believe it.

424
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:25,708
- May I get a closer look?

425
00:34:31,666 --> 00:34:32,666
It’s okay.

426
00:34:39,708 --> 00:34:41,375
Those new ones are bad.

427
00:34:42,583 --> 00:34:43,958
You should go to a hospital.

428
00:34:45,708 --> 00:34:47,268
- Well then they’ll know what happened.

429
00:34:48,875 --> 00:34:51,208
- Just like when I was
in the chorus of Brigadoon.

430
00:34:52,083 --> 00:34:55,499
Ah, not a lot of people
have heard of it. Joe has.

431
00:34:55,500 --> 00:34:57,541
He was a Newsie, and a Pippin.

432
00:34:58,500 --> 00:35:01,333
But what’s that got to do with
the price of rice and Arty Skoller?

433
00:35:01,958 --> 00:35:02,958
- Excuse me?

434
00:35:05,958 --> 00:35:09,125
- Arty kept falling in the
orchestra pit during the blackouts,

435
00:35:09,666 --> 00:35:11,291
’cause he was blind in one eye.

436
00:35:12,375 --> 00:35:16,000
But that was a lie, and we all knew it.

437
00:35:16,791 --> 00:35:20,208
David Brooks played Tommy, the star part,

438
00:35:20,625 --> 00:35:24,500
but he was a damn bully and he
kept pushing Arty in,

439
00:35:25,333 --> 00:35:27,791
because Arty was a better dancer.

440
00:35:29,333 --> 00:35:30,874
We all asked Arty,

441
00:35:30,875 --> 00:35:32,916
why don’t you just tell the stage manager,

442
00:35:33,250 --> 00:35:35,207
or quit, or kick his ass.

443
00:35:35,208 --> 00:35:37,375
Hell, we’ll do it for you
if you don’t want to,

444
00:35:37,916 --> 00:35:39,625
but all Arty kept saying is,

445
00:35:41,041 --> 00:35:42,708
“I’m blind in one eye!”

446
00:35:44,166 --> 00:35:47,040
After months of the cello player
breaking his fall,

447
00:35:47,041 --> 00:35:48,583
I took him aside

448
00:35:50,166 --> 00:35:52,041
and I said “Jesus, Arty,"

449
00:35:53,958 --> 00:35:55,875
“you still got your other eye.”

450
00:35:59,125 --> 00:36:00,958
- You can do something
about almost anything.

451
00:36:02,333 --> 00:36:03,708
- You’re very stealthy.

452
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:05,541
- Aren’t they all?

453
00:36:06,833 --> 00:36:08,166
- How did it happen, Eli?

454
00:36:15,375 --> 00:36:16,583
- I gotta go.

455
00:36:20,958 --> 00:36:23,750
- If you go, you don’t get back in.

456
00:36:27,583 --> 00:36:29,666
- The bar is a temple.

457
00:36:30,875 --> 00:36:31,875
- I’m a rabbi.

458
00:36:33,166 --> 00:36:34,625
Bring your Camels.

459
00:36:38,416 --> 00:36:39,750
- I’m not a very good Jew.

460
00:36:40,541 --> 00:36:41,750
- Bring them anyway.

461
00:36:47,916 --> 00:36:50,041
- Mo knows I hate it as much
as when he hides it.

462
00:36:52,083 --> 00:36:53,458
- You see Matt over there?

463
00:36:55,541 --> 00:36:57,250
Works his butt off for us.

464
00:36:58,458 --> 00:37:00,083
We can’t pay him what he deserves.

465
00:37:02,375 --> 00:37:04,457
But he loves it when he surprises us

466
00:37:04,458 --> 00:37:06,958
with a tax refund we didn’t expect.

467
00:37:08,583 --> 00:37:10,423
I asked him about it
and you know what he said?

468
00:37:11,041 --> 00:37:12,041
- What?

469
00:37:12,750 --> 00:37:16,291
- He said, when we do good deeds,

470
00:37:17,333 --> 00:37:19,625
we shouldn’t sound trumpets for ourselves

471
00:37:20,208 --> 00:37:22,375
like the hypocrites do in the streets.

472
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,416
But what we should do

473
00:37:25,750 --> 00:37:28,625
is a little secret something
for ourselves.

474
00:37:34,208 --> 00:37:35,666
- What’s that got to do with Mo?

475
00:37:37,666 --> 00:37:39,915
- Well if Mo can somehow pull off

476
00:37:39,916 --> 00:37:43,208
being all holy and a regular guy

477
00:37:45,375 --> 00:37:47,583
the man deserves to bum a smoke

478
00:37:49,083 --> 00:37:51,416
especially when he thinks
not even you know about it.

479
00:38:08,958 --> 00:38:09,958
- Hey, you play?

480
00:38:10,333 --> 00:38:11,875
- I thought you wanted
to bum a smoke.

481
00:38:12,291 --> 00:38:13,625
You’ve got some serious game.

482
00:38:15,250 --> 00:38:17,333
- Too bad I don’t make
some serious money.

483
00:38:18,541 --> 00:38:19,541
- You know, it’s weird.

484
00:38:20,041 --> 00:38:21,291
I’ve been drinking all night

485
00:38:23,833 --> 00:38:25,000
and I don’t feel a thing.

486
00:38:25,583 --> 00:38:27,791
- Well, it’s been a long night and...
- Yeah.

487
00:38:28,166 --> 00:38:30,000
You started long before you got here.

488
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,333
- Wait, how do you know when I started?

489
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:40,140
- I know how much a guy drinks
when he said he started a month ago.

490
00:38:43,458 --> 00:38:45,541
- Hey! You!

491
00:38:46,041 --> 00:38:48,375
Yeah, you with the big fat eye!

492
00:38:50,208 --> 00:38:52,541
She doesn’t beat you ’cause you drink.

493
00:38:56,791 --> 00:38:57,875
- Let’s have it.

494
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,041
We’re all in.

495
00:39:00,541 --> 00:39:01,541
- Out on the street,

496
00:39:01,542 --> 00:39:03,666
there was this cold snap from the Hudson.

497
00:39:04,333 --> 00:39:05,708
But it’s warm here.

498
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:09,000
- I know. Spooky, ain’t it?

499
00:39:10,333 --> 00:39:11,833
- All right.
- Let’s do this.

500
00:39:12,041 --> 00:39:14,166
- All right, It’s gonna be you and me

501
00:39:15,291 --> 00:39:16,291
versus him and Dog.

502
00:39:16,791 --> 00:39:18,291
- Fine by me. Dad?

503
00:39:18,541 --> 00:39:19,541
- I’m game.

504
00:39:20,125 --> 00:39:21,725
- Okay, now why don’t I like these odds?

505
00:39:21,916 --> 00:39:22,958
- Don’t worry about it.

506
00:39:32,375 --> 00:39:34,207
- Okay, is this guy
a chip off the old block?

507
00:39:34,208 --> 00:39:35,916
- Yeah, the chip didn’t get the
height.

508
00:39:43,166 --> 00:39:44,958
- That’s the good thing
about being adopted.

509
00:39:45,166 --> 00:39:46,540
- Hey, you’re no Kobe either.

510
00:39:46,541 --> 00:39:47,541
- Shoot!

511
00:39:51,458 --> 00:39:52,458
- You okay?

512
00:39:58,125 --> 00:39:59,125
- Sorry.

513
00:40:01,916 --> 00:40:03,125
It’s been a rough few days.

514
00:40:04,375 --> 00:40:05,416
- Why’d she do it?

515
00:40:08,833 --> 00:40:10,625
- Who else knows?
- No one.

516
00:40:14,541 --> 00:40:17,083
It was the Mozart Concerto Number 3.

517
00:40:17,125 --> 00:40:18,375
- Beautiful piece.

518
00:40:19,916 --> 00:40:21,708
- Was it playing when she hit you?

519
00:40:23,166 --> 00:40:25,166
- I play it every time I try to sleep.

520
00:40:26,333 --> 00:40:28,541
- Same part? Over and over?

521
00:40:29,041 --> 00:40:30,041
- Um-hmm.

522
00:40:31,375 --> 00:40:35,208
- When you hear it,
what’s it sound like?

523
00:40:41,833 --> 00:40:46,166
- At first it’s choppers

524
00:40:49,166 --> 00:40:50,666
and then there’s gunfire.

525
00:40:51,958 --> 00:40:55,541
- Dribble, but show us.

526
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,041
- There it is.

527
00:41:12,250 --> 00:41:13,291
The eyes have it.

528
00:41:14,125 --> 00:41:15,999
- My head turned every which way...

529
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,624
I saw the choppers
above the sand and the rocks.

530
00:41:18,625 --> 00:41:19,957
One was on fire...

531
00:41:19,958 --> 00:41:21,624
and the other was spinning out of control.

532
00:41:21,625 --> 00:41:23,458
- Its tail section spitting smoke,

533
00:41:23,791 --> 00:41:26,375
the blades breaking apart on impact.

534
00:41:27,083 --> 00:41:28,963
- Wait, how do you guys know
so much about this?

535
00:41:29,375 --> 00:41:30,750
- We’ve been where you are.

536
00:41:34,833 --> 00:41:37,333
- There were horrible screams
of men coming from inside.

537
00:41:38,583 --> 00:41:40,708
The other chopper was on
the other side of the dune.

538
00:41:41,291 --> 00:41:42,958
Then two of your guys rushed over.

539
00:41:43,958 --> 00:41:44,958
One of them was you.

540
00:41:45,541 --> 00:41:46,708
- You were blind.

541
00:41:49,041 --> 00:41:50,041
- The sand.

542
00:41:50,625 --> 00:41:52,083
- I reached in to free him...

543
00:41:53,916 --> 00:41:55,875
and I finally got to his harness.

544
00:41:57,958 --> 00:42:01,208
I yanked it up, and it was...

545
00:42:02,750 --> 00:42:03,750
- Tommy.

546
00:42:07,958 --> 00:42:09,333
- The flames took over.

547
00:42:09,958 --> 00:42:11,708
You pulled the pilot, your friend

548
00:42:11,958 --> 00:42:12,958
from the Huey...

549
00:42:17,750 --> 00:42:18,791
- Tommy?

550
00:42:23,708 --> 00:42:25,166
- C’mon Tommy!

551
00:42:27,625 --> 00:42:29,625
Stay with me, stay with me!

552
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:33,082
- You’re gonna get yourself killed,
Sergeant! Drop me, drop me and go!

553
00:42:33,083 --> 00:42:36,832
- Hell no! Medic! Medic!

554
00:42:36,833 --> 00:42:39,833
Man down! Man down!

555
00:42:48,333 --> 00:42:49,666
- I’m sorry, Sergeant.

556
00:42:50,416 --> 00:42:52,165
He’s lost too much blood,
there’s nothing I can do.

557
00:42:52,166 --> 00:42:54,166
- There must be something you can do!

558
00:42:56,833 --> 00:42:58,249
- He knows his job, buddy.

559
00:42:58,250 --> 00:43:00,291
- It’s gonna be all right,
it’s gonna be all right.

560
00:43:00,708 --> 00:43:03,028
- We can’t stay here, I gotta go,
I gotta make a nine-line!

561
00:43:05,791 --> 00:43:08,040
- No! Not yet! Not yet!

562
00:43:08,041 --> 00:43:09,791
- It’s all right!
Get your hands off me

563
00:43:10,125 --> 00:43:11,333
I’m here to help.

564
00:43:13,083 --> 00:43:16,250
- I’m here, son.
- Stay with me, man.

565
00:43:20,833 --> 00:43:22,708
- I can’t save everyone.

566
00:43:24,416 --> 00:43:26,250
He won’t let go unless you do.

567
00:43:32,541 --> 00:43:36,083
- I guess it’s my turn.
Is it that simple?

568
00:43:36,500 --> 00:43:40,541
- Yeah, it is. What’s your name, Sergeant?

569
00:43:41,166 --> 00:43:43,208
- Caplan. Thomas Caplan.

570
00:43:43,333 --> 00:43:46,708
- All right, Caplan, we’re here.

571
00:43:47,166 --> 00:43:49,750
- Eli?
- Yeah buddy. Yeah, I'm here.

572
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:53,000
- Take care of her, okay?
Take care of my girl.

573
00:43:55,208 --> 00:43:59,041
Tell her what happened
so she doesn’t take it out on you.

574
00:44:26,541 --> 00:44:28,000
- Doc.

575
00:45:29,458 --> 00:45:32,083
- When I got back,
I looked her up like Tommy asked.

576
00:45:32,583 --> 00:45:34,375
Told her what went down.

577
00:45:36,083 --> 00:45:38,125
Of course she went to pieces.

578
00:45:38,333 --> 00:45:41,583
She leaned on me,
and I leaned on her and...

579
00:45:42,541 --> 00:45:43,916
but we took it slow.

580
00:45:44,708 --> 00:45:46,208
We were lonely, so...

581
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:49,208
we took it further.

582
00:45:51,041 --> 00:45:54,041
- But you had the music.
All she had was you.

583
00:45:54,583 --> 00:45:56,703
- That’s what comes from
throwing caution to the wind.

584
00:45:57,791 --> 00:46:00,500
- Passion is carnivorous.

585
00:46:01,041 --> 00:46:02,083
- Hmm.

586
00:46:02,416 --> 00:46:05,000
- I think you and me really
pulled something off here, baby.

587
00:46:07,375 --> 00:46:08,333
Cheers.

588
00:46:08,334 --> 00:46:09,583
- Cheers, baby.

589
00:46:10,208 --> 00:46:12,166
- Cheers, brother.

590
00:46:14,500 --> 00:46:17,916
- Oh, it’s, uh, behind the owl.
I moved it.

591
00:46:18,291 --> 00:46:21,291
- You’re branching out on me.

592
00:46:28,333 --> 00:46:29,750
- Say when.

593
00:46:31,833 --> 00:46:33,750
- When.
- Wrong.

594
00:46:42,541 --> 00:46:44,333
- You sure you wanna be complicit?

595
00:46:44,541 --> 00:46:47,041
- Shhhh, not so loud, bro.

596
00:46:47,833 --> 00:46:50,041
That’s what nightcaps
and enablers are for.

597
00:46:55,875 --> 00:46:57,500
- So what’s with the Camels?

598
00:46:59,166 --> 00:47:00,916
- What’s with the heroin?

599
00:47:02,833 --> 00:47:05,500
- Well we can’t all be
the mighty Moses.

600
00:47:07,250 --> 00:47:10,625
You know, me and Maggie

601
00:47:12,500 --> 00:47:16,833
we didn’t put shoes
or socks on for two weeks.

602
00:47:17,208 --> 00:47:18,750
- Yeah, must’ve been nice.

603
00:47:19,625 --> 00:47:21,875
Unless it cramped your habit, of course.

604
00:47:25,833 --> 00:47:27,083
- It didn’t.

605
00:47:30,083 --> 00:47:31,750
‘Cause I didn’t need it.

606
00:47:32,250 --> 00:47:34,500
- But you did tonight, right?

607
00:47:35,708 --> 00:47:37,875
- I was here tonight.

608
00:47:41,291 --> 00:47:45,375
I’m gonna be fine, Mo. I’m gonna be fine.

609
00:47:48,125 --> 00:47:49,625
- Have I been a good brother?

610
00:47:54,416 --> 00:47:55,833
- The best.

611
00:47:59,166 --> 00:48:00,750
- I want you to stop.

612
00:48:05,625 --> 00:48:06,791
- Okay.

613
00:48:09,166 --> 00:48:10,916
- And you need to talk to Maggie.

614
00:48:14,375 --> 00:48:15,833
- Okay.

615
00:48:17,250 --> 00:48:18,500
- And Dog too.

616
00:48:19,916 --> 00:48:21,791
- What’re you doing to me here?

617
00:48:27,500 --> 00:48:32,583
- Dog made us brothers,
and it’s still confusing.

618
00:48:37,125 --> 00:48:39,041
- It’s pretty schizophrenic, right?

619
00:48:43,541 --> 00:48:45,916
- So what happens
when the jig is up?

620
00:48:49,291 --> 00:48:52,083
- If that happens,
it’s supposed to, right?

621
00:48:57,625 --> 00:48:59,583
So let’s shut her down
for awhile, huh?

622
00:49:00,750 --> 00:49:03,666
- We can’t. Not yet.

623
00:49:06,625 --> 00:49:08,250
We gotta go back, Mo.

624
00:49:58,208 --> 00:49:59,583
- You know him?

625
00:50:00,833 --> 00:50:02,957
- Yeah, we grew up together, awhile ago.

626
00:50:02,958 --> 00:50:04,000
Kinda like you and Mo.

627
00:50:04,625 --> 00:50:05,625
- How long’s it been?

628
00:50:06,458 --> 00:50:08,125
- Fifteen years, probably.

629
00:50:08,333 --> 00:50:10,083
Didn’t even know he was in the military.

630
00:50:11,833 --> 00:50:14,541
- You should go talk to him.
It’s almost last call.

631
00:50:19,625 --> 00:50:22,541
- Yeah, I’m gonna wait
till the girl splits.

632
00:50:23,625 --> 00:50:25,505
- Why don’t you just tell him
to lose the beard?

633
00:50:28,125 --> 00:50:29,125
What’d I say?

634
00:50:29,791 --> 00:50:31,791
- Gay people don’t always dig that term.

635
00:50:33,958 --> 00:50:34,958
- How would you know?

636
00:50:35,208 --> 00:50:37,125
- Me and Mary were at Stonewall.

637
00:50:37,333 --> 00:50:39,458
We told Jess, and now Jess is telling him.

638
00:50:40,750 --> 00:50:42,875
- It’s just good parenting
from the Left.

639
00:50:47,875 --> 00:50:50,541
- Mommy needs another one, dear.
- Coming up.

640
00:50:51,291 --> 00:50:52,750
- Thank you, love.

641
00:50:56,375 --> 00:50:59,833
- Fifteen years.
Probably doesn’t even remember you.

642
00:51:11,208 --> 00:51:12,208
- Matt!

643
00:51:13,583 --> 00:51:15,041
- Gabe?
- Yeah, man.

644
00:51:15,708 --> 00:51:17,625
- Holy crap, man, how’s it going?

645
00:51:18,583 --> 00:51:20,457
- Fleet Week, right?
- Yeah, right right right.

646
00:51:20,458 --> 00:51:22,540
- I had no idea,
what’re you up to?

647
00:51:22,541 --> 00:51:24,290
- Oh, well, I’m an accountant.
- Accountant?

648
00:51:24,291 --> 00:51:25,707
What happened to Broadway,
I thought that’s what you were

649
00:51:25,708 --> 00:51:26,832
doing in New York.

650
00:51:26,833 --> 00:51:28,500
- I’m in and out of shows and tours

651
00:51:28,625 --> 00:51:30,875
but if I don’t become Hugh Jackman,
maybe Fed Chair?

652
00:51:33,916 --> 00:51:36,291
- This is awesome,
where do you live around here?

653
00:51:36,416 --> 00:51:38,916
- Oh, I'm not too far. You got
a hotel room for the night?

654
00:51:39,500 --> 00:51:40,958
Wanna catch up, hang out?

655
00:51:41,291 --> 00:51:44,540
- Yeah, that’d actually be great.
You got any coke or pot or...?

656
00:51:44,541 --> 00:51:47,040
- Um... I’ve got some medical marijuana.

657
00:51:47,041 --> 00:51:50,083
- Oh, medical, huh?
- Yeah, back pain, took a fall.

658
00:51:50,166 --> 00:51:51,750
- Cool. Not the fall.

659
00:51:53,666 --> 00:51:55,208
Let’s do it.
- Yeah, let’s go.

660
00:51:56,250 --> 00:51:58,832
- I don’t do coke much, man,
but you know, it’s Fleet Week, so...

661
00:51:58,833 --> 00:52:00,582
- (Sure, sure.
- Gabe) No holds barred.

662
00:52:00,583 --> 00:52:02,166
- That’s what they all say.

663
00:52:06,583 --> 00:52:07,875
- Thank you.

664
00:52:26,458 --> 00:52:27,708
- The pot doesn’t come this way.

665
00:52:28,666 --> 00:52:30,291
I roll it.

666
00:52:37,041 --> 00:52:40,707
- Hey, that’s you and, uh...
Janice Holt.

667
00:52:40,708 --> 00:52:43,208
- Yeah, yeah, she was hot.

668
00:52:46,250 --> 00:52:47,291
Who’d you take?

669
00:52:48,708 --> 00:52:49,750
- Faye Summers.

670
00:52:50,166 --> 00:52:51,458
- Mmmm, nice.

671
00:52:54,083 --> 00:52:57,458
- Damn, you look the exact same.
You know that?

672
00:52:58,708 --> 00:53:00,916
- No.
- No really, you do. I'm serious.

673
00:53:02,125 --> 00:53:03,125
What about me?

674
00:53:05,250 --> 00:53:07,249
- Well, your uniform, you know,
you being a

675
00:53:07,250 --> 00:53:09,416
big boy in the Navy, makes you look...

676
00:53:10,666 --> 00:53:11,875
a little more serious?

677
00:53:12,416 --> 00:53:14,166
- Yep.
- Probably about everything, right?

678
00:53:33,083 --> 00:53:34,875
Oh, I’m getting emotional about the past.

679
00:53:36,916 --> 00:53:38,083
- That’s the pot.

680
00:53:38,208 --> 00:53:39,625
- Yeah. Yeah.

681
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:44,249
You know, I’m gonna crash.
C’mon, get up, get up.

682
00:53:44,250 --> 00:53:48,083
- No, no, you take the bedroom,
you’re the guest.

683
00:53:53,250 --> 00:53:55,250
- Oh, it’s a big bed.

684
00:53:56,833 --> 00:53:58,791
- I’m used to the
upper bunk on board ship.

685
00:53:59,958 --> 00:54:02,208
C’mon. Let’s catch up.

686
00:55:01,541 --> 00:55:03,208
- Good morning.

687
00:55:21,583 --> 00:55:23,791
How do you feel about dutch ovens?

688
00:55:25,250 --> 00:55:27,208
- What? Oh God no!

689
00:55:35,625 --> 00:55:40,333
♪ Birds flying high
You know how I feel ♪

690
00:55:40,666 --> 00:55:45,957
♪ Sun in the sky
You know how I feel ♪

691
00:55:45,958 --> 00:55:48,249
- You know, I feel like I love you
and I’m happy about that

692
00:55:48,250 --> 00:55:50,041
because I hate musical theater.

693
00:55:51,375 --> 00:55:54,165
- Well maybe you should get in here
and I’ll stop singing.

694
00:55:54,166 --> 00:55:56,915
- We will never get out if I get in there.
- Oh c’mon.

695
00:55:56,916 --> 00:56:00,708
I can’t do it without you,
and they can’t do it without us.

696
00:56:02,500 --> 00:56:04,833
Here, let me get this for you.

697
00:56:06,875 --> 00:56:08,583
- What would anyone do without you?

698
00:56:09,291 --> 00:56:10,750
- Very little.

699
00:56:11,750 --> 00:56:13,666
- All right, let’s not flip out.

700
00:56:28,833 --> 00:56:31,125
- Thank you.
- Shoes.

701
00:56:40,333 --> 00:56:42,374
- Where’d you get this stuff, Mo,
it’s really good.

702
00:56:42,375 --> 00:56:44,916
- I told you, I got a guy.
- You got a guy?

703
00:56:45,375 --> 00:56:46,583
I need his number.

704
00:56:47,750 --> 00:56:48,875
- No you don’t.

705
00:56:49,125 --> 00:56:50,125
- Jess, you want some?

706
00:56:51,083 --> 00:56:53,666
- It’s not even legal yet, Dad.
- Oh c'mon. l

707
00:56:54,916 --> 00:56:56,916
These two, oh my god.

708
00:56:57,625 --> 00:56:59,833
- All right, just one more.

709
00:57:00,458 --> 00:57:02,541
- The ceremony, you couldn’t wait?

710
00:57:02,833 --> 00:57:05,583
- We’re just having some fun.
- Yeah, c’mon. Loosen up a little.

711
00:57:06,125 --> 00:57:07,125
Oh, they’re coming.

712
00:57:21,541 --> 00:57:22,541
- Okay.

713
00:57:23,541 --> 00:57:25,708
- Dearly beloved...

714
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:31,041
- We are gathered here today

715
00:57:31,208 --> 00:57:35,583
to celebrate the love
between Matthew and Gabriel

716
00:57:38,083 --> 00:57:41,083
who have written their own vows.

717
00:57:42,458 --> 00:57:43,458
Matthew?

718
00:57:46,666 --> 00:57:48,083
It was love at first sight

719
00:57:49,291 --> 00:57:52,750
when I saw your sister, I...
- What?

720
00:57:55,625 --> 00:57:58,625
- It took me awhile
to realize it had to be you.

721
00:58:00,041 --> 00:58:04,333
But when I caught my ex-wife
trying to hook up with you, I...

722
00:58:06,208 --> 00:58:07,250
- You’re doing schtick.

723
00:58:07,416 --> 00:58:08,583
- Everything is schtick.

724
00:58:08,833 --> 00:58:10,291
- Get to it, will ya?

725
00:58:10,500 --> 00:58:11,500
- Okay.

726
00:58:13,375 --> 00:58:16,041
- Gabe, would you like to start?
- Yeah, uh...

727
00:58:16,875 --> 00:58:18,041
that’d be great, would you?

728
00:58:21,500 --> 00:58:24,916
- I can think of a million reasons
why I should not marry you,

729
00:58:25,500 --> 00:58:29,749
but I can’t think of one
for not loving you

730
00:58:29,750 --> 00:58:32,166
the way that I’ve never loved
anyone like this before.

731
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:38,625
- He’s gonna say, it’s a road best not
taken for the fearful.

732
00:58:42,250 --> 00:58:44,208
- There’s no way anyone can guarantee

733
00:58:44,541 --> 00:58:47,166
what’s gonna go down in life
or between two people.

734
00:58:48,291 --> 00:58:50,458
But I will never, ever

735
00:58:51,083 --> 00:58:53,416
love a man more than you.

736
00:58:55,125 --> 00:58:56,916
- You know, when I
first saw you, I...

737
00:58:57,625 --> 00:59:00,333
I knew that if it was gonna be a man,
it was gonna be you.

738
00:59:01,666 --> 00:59:04,500
How can anyone who loves
like this not want it all the time?

739
00:59:06,583 --> 00:59:09,708
- This is a road best
not taken for the fearful.

740
00:59:13,708 --> 00:59:19,000
But these are two of the
bravest souls I have ever met.

741
00:59:20,458 --> 00:59:21,833
You deserve each other.

742
00:59:22,541 --> 00:59:25,041
In front of all of your loved ones
gathered here today,

743
00:59:25,791 --> 00:59:28,333
Matthew, Gabriel,

744
00:59:29,041 --> 00:59:31,125
I bless this union.

745
00:59:33,875 --> 00:59:38,333
I now pronounce you married
in the eyes of God.

746
00:59:38,750 --> 00:59:41,124
Baruch Atah Adonai

747
00:59:41,125 --> 00:59:44,333
Eloheinu Melech Ha'Olam.

748
00:59:51,041 --> 00:59:54,166
Nie! Nie!

749
01:00:15,958 --> 01:00:17,041
- Shalom.

750
01:00:17,250 --> 01:00:19,665
- Cut the crap. I just told
my Hebrew teacher

751
01:00:19,666 --> 01:00:21,332
to shut the hell up in her native tongue.

752
01:00:21,333 --> 01:00:22,500
- Zoey, wait, what happened?

753
01:00:22,625 --> 01:00:24,934
- That’s a very ugly woman who’d liked
very much to schtoop with you.

754
01:00:24,958 --> 01:00:26,041
That’s the word, right?

755
01:00:26,083 --> 01:00:27,666
- Yeah, but you can’t be serious.

756
01:00:29,291 --> 01:00:30,750
- Mo, let me ask you something.

757
01:00:31,125 --> 01:00:33,085
Why am I the one who’s converting,
why aren’t you?

758
01:00:34,958 --> 01:00:36,875
- You want to, I never asked you to.

759
01:00:37,500 --> 01:00:38,500
- Oh really?

760
01:00:39,708 --> 01:00:43,124
Mo, I love you, I wanna marry you

761
01:00:43,125 --> 01:00:45,000
have kids with you,
isn’t that enough?

762
01:00:46,916 --> 01:00:48,040
- Babe, this is silly.

763
01:00:48,041 --> 01:00:50,249
- If I don’t go through with this,
what happens to us, Mo?

764
01:00:50,250 --> 01:00:51,708
Because I’m not that sure.

765
01:00:52,125 --> 01:00:55,500
I thought I was. I’ve been doing that.

766
01:00:56,708 --> 01:00:59,000
Why can’t I just be me,
a God-fearing Catholic?

767
01:01:00,583 --> 01:01:02,874
- Look, I gotta go, it’s couples
counseling, it’s Tuesday

768
01:01:02,875 --> 01:01:04,291
we can talk about this later.

769
01:01:05,166 --> 01:01:08,583
- Perfect. Another one
of God’s little jests.

770
01:01:11,958 --> 01:01:14,500
- Could be, I’ll make sure to ask him
about that later.

771
01:01:29,833 --> 01:01:31,958
- Hello, Shakespeare.

772
01:01:32,375 --> 01:01:34,125
Written any good plays lately?

773
01:01:36,375 --> 01:01:37,541
- You tell me.

774
01:01:38,625 --> 01:01:40,165
- Matter of Fact was excellent,

775
01:01:40,166 --> 01:01:43,291
but I don’t remember
Ethel Merman looking so enticing.

776
01:01:43,750 --> 01:01:45,957
- What are you talking about,
it was Lady Gaga

777
01:01:45,958 --> 01:01:47,499
and she got a Tony Award.

778
01:01:47,500 --> 01:01:49,582
- Oh yes, Lady Gaga,

779
01:01:49,583 --> 01:01:52,791
who was born to be a star,
and straddle Bradley Cooper.

780
01:01:53,375 --> 01:01:54,416
- What are you drinking?

781
01:01:54,583 --> 01:01:56,000
- Debonnet, rocks.

782
01:02:13,333 --> 01:02:15,833
- Ma’am, you know you can’t smoke
in bars anymore, right?

783
01:02:18,250 --> 01:02:21,583
- It’s closing time. Beat it, punk.

784
01:02:27,416 --> 01:02:28,750
- One Dubonnet, rocks.

785
01:02:30,125 --> 01:02:31,166
- Here, here.

786
01:02:32,250 --> 01:02:33,250
- Yes.

787
01:02:34,291 --> 01:02:35,708
It’s so good to see you.

788
01:02:36,416 --> 01:02:37,750
- It’s good to be seen.

789
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:42,333
I’m going to be 92 next week.
That’s a good age, isn’t it?

790
01:02:42,625 --> 01:02:43,625
- Indeed.

791
01:02:56,500 --> 01:02:57,708
- Lilly.

792
01:03:08,458 --> 01:03:11,833
- I’m going to go to sleep...
and not wake up.

793
01:03:26,625 --> 01:03:27,833
Where’s your brother?

794
01:03:30,041 --> 01:03:31,624
- He’s in the back,
you want me to get him?

795
01:03:31,625 --> 01:03:34,625
- Oh no no no no, I was just wondering.

796
01:03:36,500 --> 01:03:38,583
He’s never really talked to me, you know.

797
01:03:39,833 --> 01:03:41,208
- The wedding, Lilly.

798
01:03:42,125 --> 01:03:43,708
- Oh, that was years ago.

799
01:03:44,708 --> 01:03:48,416
I’d like another Dubonnet,
another tiny triple.

800
01:03:48,750 --> 01:03:49,750
- Yes ma’am.

801
01:03:51,458 --> 01:03:54,166
- The memory plays a few tricks sometimes

802
01:03:55,083 --> 01:03:56,291
you understand?

803
01:03:58,875 --> 01:03:59,875
- Sure.

804
01:04:03,875 --> 01:04:07,541
- In my long life, the difference between

805
01:04:07,916 --> 01:04:10,916
a really good boy and a really bad boy

806
01:04:11,375 --> 01:04:13,958
is as wide as any ocean.

807
01:04:17,166 --> 01:04:18,332
- What you got there, Lil?

808
01:04:18,333 --> 01:04:20,291
- Oh, a good boy.

809
01:04:21,333 --> 01:04:22,540
- Don’t I know it.

810
01:04:22,541 --> 01:04:24,582
- I bet.

811
01:04:24,583 --> 01:04:27,457
I’ve been coming to this bar
for many, many, many years,

812
01:04:27,458 --> 01:04:29,166
but never this late, not ever.

813
01:04:29,458 --> 01:04:32,000
- Last call in the right bar
can be very precious, Lil.

814
01:04:32,166 --> 01:04:33,375
- You just said a mouthful.

815
01:04:34,291 --> 01:04:35,666
- It’s my trade, you know?

816
01:04:38,916 --> 01:04:41,666
You don’t really want to go to sleep
and not wake up, right?

817
01:04:44,791 --> 01:04:46,166
- Yes and no.

818
01:04:47,750 --> 01:04:51,708
I’ve had a good, long life,
but it started out very bad.

819
01:04:53,458 --> 01:04:54,833
- Which camp were you in?

820
01:04:56,250 --> 01:04:57,250
- We weren’t.

821
01:04:58,750 --> 01:05:03,541
They stopped the train, in the middle
of nowhere, and they let us run.

822
01:05:05,541 --> 01:05:06,625
- Why?

823
01:05:07,333 --> 01:05:08,458
- For sport.

824
01:05:26,666 --> 01:05:27,666
- Papa!

825
01:05:29,458 --> 01:05:30,750
- Lilly, don’t stop, run!

826
01:05:37,916 --> 01:05:38,916
- Papa!

827
01:05:40,833 --> 01:05:42,541
Come on, Papa, come on!

828
01:05:44,500 --> 01:05:45,500
- Go!

829
01:05:57,125 --> 01:05:59,291
- Shhh, shhhhh...

830
01:06:16,458 --> 01:06:17,625
- Come on, girl!

831
01:06:18,083 --> 01:06:19,083
- No!

832
01:06:21,458 --> 01:06:22,583
- I’ve got you!

833
01:06:24,041 --> 01:06:25,624
We’ll be right behind you.

834
01:06:25,625 --> 01:06:26,625
- Lilly, listen.

835
01:06:26,916 --> 01:06:27,916
Go with him.

836
01:06:28,250 --> 01:06:29,374
- You will too.

837
01:06:29,375 --> 01:06:30,541
- I’ll be close.

838
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:32,040
- You’re hurt.

839
01:06:32,041 --> 01:06:33,166
- Just a little.

840
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:35,000
- I can hurry.

841
01:06:35,001 --> 01:06:36,561
- Yeah, but he can hurry better, honey.

842
01:06:38,666 --> 01:06:40,124
- Is that why we have to go?

843
01:06:40,125 --> 01:06:41,833
- Yes, it’s here to take us to the border.

844
01:06:45,958 --> 01:06:47,208
Make your choice.

845
01:07:10,083 --> 01:07:11,500
- What is her name?

846
01:07:14,166 --> 01:07:15,500
- Lilly.

847
01:07:17,041 --> 01:07:18,083
- Lilly.

848
01:07:20,083 --> 01:07:21,208
That’s beautiful.

849
01:07:26,541 --> 01:07:28,083
- You can’t take me with you.

850
01:07:30,166 --> 01:07:31,458
- No.

851
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:39,791
- What is your name?

852
01:07:41,291 --> 01:07:42,583
- Christian.

853
01:07:44,583 --> 01:07:45,916
- Christian.

854
01:07:48,041 --> 01:07:49,166
Christian.

855
01:07:50,708 --> 01:07:51,916
Take this.

856
01:08:00,250 --> 01:08:03,625
- No! Don’t do that.

857
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:13,250
- I’m already dead.

858
01:08:13,500 --> 01:08:15,541
- Dead men don’t complain.

859
01:08:20,666 --> 01:08:22,041
- Give this to Lilly.

860
01:08:23,416 --> 01:08:25,041
- Give it to her yourself.

861
01:08:54,250 --> 01:08:55,250
- This right?

862
01:08:55,500 --> 01:08:57,082
- Now it is.
- Whoa, hey.

863
01:08:57,083 --> 01:08:58,583
Jesus, Zoey wants kids.

864
01:08:59,416 --> 01:09:00,750
- There’s always adoption.

865
01:09:03,875 --> 01:09:06,291
Here, see if these fit.

866
01:09:07,083 --> 01:09:08,083
- All right.

867
01:09:09,500 --> 01:09:10,582
- These aren’t gonna fit

868
01:09:10,583 --> 01:09:12,041
I can tell just by looking at them.

869
01:09:14,541 --> 01:09:16,707
- Well, I guess I’m bringing you home

870
01:09:16,708 --> 01:09:19,250
to your natural environment, Yeti.

871
01:09:19,583 --> 01:09:21,083
- How high is this mountain again?

872
01:09:22,791 --> 01:09:24,125
- Just don’t look down.

873
01:09:25,916 --> 01:09:28,083
- How much weight can those ropes hold?

874
01:09:29,208 --> 01:09:30,750
- You’ve been fasting, right?

875
01:10:14,666 --> 01:10:17,041
- Hey, I’m coming.

876
01:10:18,500 --> 01:10:20,416
- Keep up.
- I’m coming.

877
01:11:01,291 --> 01:11:02,458
- Gabe?

878
01:11:02,750 --> 01:11:05,000
- Yeah, I’m almost there.

879
01:11:08,833 --> 01:11:10,416
- Got it, though?
- Yep.

880
01:11:18,916 --> 01:11:22,708
- Wow, this is a stunning view.

881
01:11:23,541 --> 01:11:25,125
- Yeah, it’s too perfect.

882
01:11:29,458 --> 01:11:30,916
- There’s no remedy for that.

883
01:11:34,291 --> 01:11:35,458
All right, shall we?

884
01:11:35,958 --> 01:11:36,958
- Yeah.

885
01:11:37,708 --> 01:11:38,875
- You first.

886
01:11:43,541 --> 01:11:45,166
- Listen, just trust me.

887
01:11:46,291 --> 01:11:48,500
Left hand, right there.

888
01:11:49,416 --> 01:11:51,375
- It’s solid, you can trust it.
There you go.

889
01:11:54,250 --> 01:11:56,625
Now raise your right foot

890
01:11:58,750 --> 01:12:00,250
to match, right there.

891
01:12:03,875 --> 01:12:04,958
Beautiful.

892
01:12:05,291 --> 01:12:06,625
- I don’t like heights.

893
01:12:06,875 --> 01:12:09,125
- This isn’t heights,
this is like, ten feet.

894
01:12:11,416 --> 01:12:12,666
- Still not happy.

895
01:12:12,916 --> 01:12:13,916
- ’Course you’re not.

896
01:12:15,666 --> 01:12:16,791
You okay? Keep breathing.

897
01:12:23,416 --> 01:12:24,666
- Whoa, Gabe, Gabe, Gabe!

898
01:12:37,250 --> 01:12:39,333
Don’t pull, don’t...
Don’t, don’t pull!

899
01:12:41,500 --> 01:12:42,500
- Matt!

900
01:12:43,583 --> 01:12:45,832
I think we’re gonna need
to take a situation assessment here.

901
01:12:45,833 --> 01:12:49,083
- Yeah, you think? You say yours
and I’ll say mine.

902
01:12:50,583 --> 01:12:52,415
- Help! Help!

903
01:12:52,416 --> 01:12:55,416
Please somebody help!

904
01:12:55,500 --> 01:12:56,500
- Help!

905
01:12:57,333 --> 01:12:59,540
Someone please help!

906
01:12:59,541 --> 01:13:00,541
- Did you hear that?

907
01:13:00,833 --> 01:13:02,416
- Time to go, Mo!

908
01:13:03,375 --> 01:13:06,541
- Gabe, Gabe, stop, don’t pull!
Don’t pull!

909
01:13:20,541 --> 01:13:21,541
- Gabe!

910
01:13:32,583 --> 01:13:34,458
- Gabe, Gabe,
what are you doing?

911
01:13:37,875 --> 01:13:40,208
Gabe, Don't! No! Gabe!

912
01:13:40,541 --> 01:13:41,916
- Stop! No!

913
01:13:44,041 --> 01:13:45,041
Stop!

914
01:13:46,375 --> 01:13:47,458
Gabe!

915
01:14:30,333 --> 01:14:31,666
- Matthew.

916
01:14:43,500 --> 01:14:45,125
I don’t like the way you’re carrying on.

917
01:14:45,583 --> 01:14:46,333
- What?

918
01:14:46,334 --> 01:14:48,291
- I don’t like the way
he’s carrying on either.

919
01:14:49,666 --> 01:14:50,958
- I do a job here, Dog.

920
01:14:51,500 --> 01:14:54,666
I don’t bring anything else in here
but your books. Deal?

921
01:14:56,375 --> 01:14:57,375
- Nah.

922
01:14:57,958 --> 01:14:58,958
- What’s that mean?

923
01:15:01,041 --> 01:15:02,500
- I’m not akin to cruelty.

924
01:15:03,750 --> 01:15:05,291
A single act or lots of it.

925
01:15:06,916 --> 01:15:09,916
- With all due respect, boss, not all of
us are akin to you.

926
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:15,000
- Matthew

927
01:15:16,958 --> 01:15:18,000
come back in.

928
01:15:20,666 --> 01:15:21,708
Please.

929
01:15:24,791 --> 01:15:26,833
- Hi Gabe.
- Hey buddy.

930
01:15:27,291 --> 01:15:28,790
- Whoa whoa, what the hell?

931
01:15:28,791 --> 01:15:30,999
- This is happening.
- What about my chair?

932
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:31,958
- We’ll take care of it.

933
01:15:31,959 --> 01:15:34,125
- At least run it
through a car wash.

934
01:15:37,416 --> 01:15:40,041
I don’t have a complete understanding of
what’s happening here.

935
01:15:41,250 --> 01:15:42,250
Oh.

936
01:16:09,291 --> 01:16:10,458
- Did I win the lottery?

937
01:16:11,041 --> 01:16:12,761
- Hurry up, Matt’s almost
finished with Dog.

938
01:16:16,375 --> 01:16:19,374
- So, now that you’ve shown me
how you piss on a rock

939
01:16:19,375 --> 01:16:21,416
hear me out, okay?

940
01:16:23,166 --> 01:16:25,208
If you’re having trouble
looking at Gabe

941
01:16:26,541 --> 01:16:29,250
think about how hard it is
for him to look at himself.

942
01:16:32,250 --> 01:16:36,208
I think about it every day,
what he did for me.

943
01:16:37,750 --> 01:16:39,250
- And how does he know that?

944
01:16:40,083 --> 01:16:41,416
- But he left me!

945
01:16:41,708 --> 01:16:43,125
- Why is that, you think?

946
01:16:47,916 --> 01:16:49,375
- I guess I told him to.

947
01:16:50,708 --> 01:16:55,166
I guess, without telling him to, I...

948
01:16:56,625 --> 01:17:00,875
I guess my loud and clear
was pretty quiet.

949
01:17:01,625 --> 01:17:02,625
- Hey.

950
01:17:05,166 --> 01:17:06,166
Progress.

951
01:17:44,708 --> 01:17:46,208
- Excuse me, ma’am?

952
01:17:46,666 --> 01:17:47,666
We’re closed.

953
01:17:47,958 --> 01:17:51,250
- Oh, oh. I’m sorry.

954
01:17:51,416 --> 01:17:54,125
- Let me help you.
- Oh, thank you.

955
01:17:55,583 --> 01:17:58,208
Joseph, right?
- Yes, ma’am.

956
01:18:00,083 --> 01:18:01,250
- You’re a saint.

957
01:18:02,291 --> 01:18:03,833
- Then come follow me.

958
01:18:04,833 --> 01:18:06,000
- Okay.

959
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:48,875
- You didn’t know? I didn’t know either.

960
01:18:50,333 --> 01:18:52,041
Great place though, huh?

961
01:18:54,541 --> 01:18:55,583
- Yeah.

962
01:18:57,458 --> 01:18:58,666
Do you remember me?

963
01:19:00,166 --> 01:19:01,874
- Yes, of course, young man.

964
01:19:01,875 --> 01:19:06,125
- Oh, okay. ’Cause I remember you.

965
01:19:08,625 --> 01:19:11,207
- Well, my memory is not what it used to
be

966
01:19:11,208 --> 01:19:15,499
and it’s been quite a while
but I’m Lillian.

967
01:19:15,500 --> 01:19:16,541
- I'm Eli.

968
01:19:18,750 --> 01:19:19,750
- You look better.

969
01:19:19,916 --> 01:19:20,916
- Excuse me?

970
01:19:20,958 --> 01:19:23,166
- Better than the last time I saw you.

971
01:19:24,083 --> 01:19:27,250
- Ah. Was it that obvious?

972
01:19:29,083 --> 01:19:31,083
You’d been punched in the face.

973
01:19:33,583 --> 01:19:35,499
- I thought I’d been a bad little boy.

974
01:19:35,500 --> 01:19:40,332
- Oh, I always say, men are little boys...

975
01:19:40,333 --> 01:19:41,375
with whiskers.

976
01:19:42,125 --> 01:19:43,125
- Yes.

977
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:48,541
Have you had a job tonight?

978
01:19:49,375 --> 01:19:50,541
- Oh, yes, I have.

979
01:19:50,958 --> 01:19:54,208
I play in the pit of the
revival of Brigadoon.

980
01:19:54,416 --> 01:19:58,416
- Oh, oh it’s a classic. Very beautiful.

981
01:19:58,750 --> 01:20:03,624
It’s about two hunters who stumble across
a remote, tiny Scottish village

982
01:20:03,625 --> 01:20:07,333
that only comes to life
every hundred years.

983
01:20:09,791 --> 01:20:11,458
I live over there.
- Oh.

984
01:20:13,083 --> 01:20:14,666
Well can I walk you home, Lillian?

985
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:17,665
- You haven’t done this in awhile,
have you, young man?

986
01:20:17,666 --> 01:20:18,500
- What?

987
01:20:18,501 --> 01:20:21,750
- Taken a good woman’s arm.

988
01:20:23,958 --> 01:20:27,416
- Oh, you. Remember me?

989
01:20:27,666 --> 01:20:28,750
- I was the dick.

990
01:20:29,833 --> 01:20:30,833
- Yeah.

991
01:20:31,333 --> 01:20:35,250
- Oh, for goodness sake,
oh my goodness,

992
01:20:35,458 --> 01:20:39,291
you look so cold, young man.
- Oh, I’m okay. Thank you. Okay.

993
01:20:40,875 --> 01:20:41,875
Thank you.

994
01:20:42,291 --> 01:20:43,811
- What are you doing out here so late?

995
01:20:45,958 --> 01:20:50,541
- Just forgot how long it’s been. They
locked me out.

996
01:20:54,791 --> 01:20:56,111
- You were there when I was here.

997
01:20:56,916 --> 01:20:59,666
- Yeah, uh, my husband worked there.

998
01:21:01,250 --> 01:21:04,791
- Your husband? Really? Who was that?

999
01:21:06,166 --> 01:21:06,791
- Matthew.

1000
01:21:06,792 --> 01:21:09,791
- Oh yes, I remember him.

1001
01:21:10,083 --> 01:21:12,082
You do, don’t you, Eli?

1002
01:21:12,083 --> 01:21:15,540
- Yeah. That little guy
almost kicked my ass.

1003
01:21:15,541 --> 01:21:17,540
Like I had it coming, but...

1004
01:21:17,541 --> 01:21:19,208
- Yeah, that’s Matt.

1005
01:21:22,083 --> 01:21:23,875
Jesus, I just love that about him.

1006
01:21:27,791 --> 01:21:29,540
Well, hopefully I’ll see
you guys around, okay?

1007
01:21:29,541 --> 01:21:30,541
- Wait.

1008
01:21:41,458 --> 01:21:42,291
- Thanks.

1009
01:21:42,291 --> 01:21:43,291
- I wish I had more.

1010
01:21:43,833 --> 01:21:45,124
- This is all your cash? No no,

1011
01:21:45,125 --> 01:21:46,392
it’s a rough neighborhood...
- Nope.

1012
01:21:46,416 --> 01:21:47,999
- You need to get home.
- I insist.

1013
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:50,875
- Don’t worry, I will look after him.

1014
01:21:55,625 --> 01:21:59,583
- I wish there was more of this going
around. Thank you.

1015
01:22:05,041 --> 01:22:07,125
- Good night, guys.
- Good luck.

1016
01:22:22,958 --> 01:22:24,958
- Where did you get the necklace?

1017
01:22:26,083 --> 01:22:30,083
- Oh, um, my father gave it to me,

1018
01:22:30,958 --> 01:22:34,875
and his mother gave it to him.

1019
01:22:37,583 --> 01:22:40,125
- That would be your... your grandmother.

1020
01:22:42,083 --> 01:22:43,083
- Yes.

1021
01:22:43,666 --> 01:22:47,000
- And where is she?

1022
01:22:49,333 --> 01:22:50,791
- I have no idea.

1023
01:22:52,541 --> 01:22:54,666
When Jews melt down the families scatter.

1024
01:22:55,916 --> 01:22:57,708
- They... they did.

1025
01:22:58,791 --> 01:22:59,875
We did.

1026
01:23:07,833 --> 01:23:09,166
- But that’s not fair.

1027
01:23:10,541 --> 01:23:13,583
- No, Eli, no.

1028
01:23:14,875 --> 01:23:18,458
No it’s not fair, but, oh...

1029
01:23:23,375 --> 01:23:26,375
I will you tell you all about her.
