We have a new pledge class.

As punishment, Tulsi,

take the attic, to clean.

need your shining example.

- Laura. No. No.

531
00:27:51,378 --> 00:27:52,713
There's no way.
That's not possible.

532
00:27:52,713 --> 00:27:54,089
- Wait. What! Laura is Iggy?

533
00:27:54,089 --> 00:27:56,550
- No. I-I'm Iggy.

534
00:27:56,550 --> 00:27:58,802
It's what my sister
used to call me.

535
00:27:58,802 --> 00:28:00,095
She used to call me
Shauna Iguana,

536
00:28:00,095 --> 00:28:01,972
which eventually became Iggy.

537
00:28:01,972 --> 00:28:03,515
- Okay. That's really
sweet and everything,

538
00:28:03,515 --> 00:28:05,434
but I am freaking the F out
right now.

539
00:28:05,434 --> 00:28:07,060
- Jodi. No. No.
- [thud]

540
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:10,022
- Look, I know that this is
totally crazy,

541
00:28:10,022 --> 00:28:13,817
but I-I think that my sister--

542
00:28:13,817 --> 00:28:15,444
- Your sister what?

543
00:28:18,614 --> 00:28:21,158
- I think that she might be
trying to communicate with me.

544
00:28:23,118 --> 00:28:24,995
- [scoffs] What?

545
00:28:24,995 --> 00:28:28,624
Okay. You little weirdo.
We need to blow our way out.

546
00:28:28,624 --> 00:28:29,999
[claps] Get everyone.

547
00:28:32,502 --> 00:28:35,297
Okay. So, we turn on
all the pilots,

548
00:28:35,297 --> 00:28:38,342
then we shut the doors
and we fill the room with gas.

549
00:28:39,593 --> 00:28:41,595
- And then what, Rain Man?

550
00:28:41,595 --> 00:28:43,555
- And then, kaboom!

551
00:28:43,555 --> 00:28:45,849
We blow the side
of the house off.

552
00:28:45,849 --> 00:28:46,892
So you're with me?

553
00:28:47,976 --> 00:28:51,605
- One hundred percent.
And by "with you" I mean

554
00:28:51,605 --> 00:28:53,482
that I'll be on the other side
of the house with the pledges

555
00:28:53,482 --> 00:28:56,193
and everyone else,
hiding behind a sofa.

556
00:28:56,193 --> 00:28:58,320
Their safety
is my top priority.

557
00:28:58,320 --> 00:28:59,529
[whispers] Go.

558
00:29:03,992 --> 00:29:05,243
- Yeah.

559
00:29:05,243 --> 00:29:07,746
- Okay. Jodi, this is
a really terrible idea.

560
00:29:07,746 --> 00:29:09,081
Okay. Look,
there's something going on

561
00:29:09,081 --> 00:29:10,707
that we don't
entirely understand.

562
00:29:10,707 --> 00:29:12,125
- Okay, scrub.

563
00:29:12,125 --> 00:29:13,877
Talk to me when you get
some rando's blood in your hair.

564
00:29:13,877 --> 00:29:15,420
Does nothing work in this house?

565
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:16,797
- The house doesn't
want you to leave.

566
00:29:16,797 --> 00:29:18,840
- It's a house, Shauna.
Houses don't want anything.

567
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:20,676
It's a house. Oh, matches.

568
00:29:20,676 --> 00:29:22,552
- Okay. So, maybe there's
something inside the house.

569
00:29:22,552 --> 00:29:23,679
Maybe there's something that--

570
00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:25,806
- A ghost?
You a Ghostbuster now?

571
00:29:25,806 --> 00:29:26,890
- No. That's not what I said.

572
00:29:26,890 --> 00:29:28,392
Look, none of this makes sense.

573
00:29:28,392 --> 00:29:29,935
How did I survive that fall?

574
00:29:29,935 --> 00:29:31,478
How does the window
whisper works?

575
00:29:31,478 --> 00:29:33,188
- [shouting] Hello! Huh!

576
00:29:33,188 --> 00:29:34,982
- The text.
- What text?

577
00:29:34,982 --> 00:29:37,234
- The text that only I got.

578
00:29:37,234 --> 00:29:38,694
"You lie, you die."

579
00:29:38,694 --> 00:29:40,529
- Okay, maybe you should be
rushing the, uh, nuthouse

580
00:29:40,529 --> 00:29:41,863
down the street.

581
00:29:41,863 --> 00:29:43,156
- Wait...

582
00:29:43,156 --> 00:29:44,574
Derrick.
- What?

583
00:29:44,574 --> 00:29:45,909
- Did Derrick lie?

584
00:29:45,909 --> 00:29:47,244
Do you know if Derrick
lied to you about anything?

585
00:29:47,244 --> 00:29:48,286
- Well, he was cheating
on his girlfriend with me

586
00:29:48,286 --> 00:29:49,913
when he died.
Does that count?

587
00:29:49,913 --> 00:29:51,790
Oh! An escape hatch.

588
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:53,542
- What? No, Jodi.

589
00:29:53,542 --> 00:29:55,919
That's not an escape hatch.
It's a crawlspace.

590
00:29:55,919 --> 00:29:57,379
- Yeah. Well, you guys
can stay back and die,

591
00:29:57,379 --> 00:29:58,964
but I'm escaping
out of that hatch.

592
00:29:58,964 --> 00:30:00,215
- Okay, Jodi.

593
00:30:00,215 --> 00:30:02,092
I need you to tell me
what happened to Laura.

594
00:30:02,092 --> 00:30:04,970
Jodi, believe me, I know you
think that none of this matters,

595
00:30:04,970 --> 00:30:07,180
but I need to know
what happened to my sister.

596
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:08,557
You need to tell me the truth.

597
00:30:08,557 --> 00:30:10,058
- You know what happened.

598
00:30:11,727 --> 00:30:13,562
[clicking]

599
00:30:13,562 --> 00:30:15,647
<i> - [voice whispers]
</i>You lie, you die.

600
00:30:15,647 --> 00:30:17,482
- Wait. Did you hear that?
- [groans] Ugh-ugh.

601
00:30:17,482 --> 00:30:19,234
- Jodi, I think I know
how to stop this.

602
00:30:19,234 --> 00:30:20,402
But you need to
tell me the truth.

603
00:30:20,402 --> 00:30:21,903
You need to tell me
the truth right now

604
00:30:21,903 --> 00:30:23,238
before something happens to you.

605
00:30:23,238 --> 00:30:25,782
- But the truth is
she died in a fire.

606
00:30:25,782 --> 00:30:27,868
She died in a fire.

607
00:30:27,868 --> 00:30:29,786
Ouch!

608
00:30:29,786 --> 00:30:31,288
- Oh, my God, Jodi.

609
00:30:33,081 --> 00:30:35,751
[sighs] You're okay.

610
00:30:35,751 --> 00:30:40,589
You're fine, you told the truth,
so you're-you're okay.

611
00:30:40,589 --> 00:30:43,050
- [scoffs] I'm fine.

612
00:30:43,050 --> 00:30:44,176
[Shauna sighs]

613
00:30:49,514 --> 00:30:50,974
[Shauna screams]

614
00:30:58,523 --> 00:31:02,027
[♪♪♪]

615
00:31:02,027 --> 00:31:04,529
[Shauna sobbing]

616
00:31:07,115 --> 00:31:10,327
- Safe to say her plan
didn't work out how she wanted.

617
00:31:10,327 --> 00:31:13,663
- [sobs] The last thing she said
is that my sister, Laura,

618
00:31:13,663 --> 00:31:16,041
died in the fire,
and then this happened.

619
00:31:17,542 --> 00:31:18,794
- I'm gonna go find
a cell signal.

620
00:31:18,794 --> 00:31:20,504
I suggest you all do the same.

621
00:31:24,716 --> 00:31:25,759
[Shauna sobbing]

622
00:31:36,728 --> 00:31:38,021
- Anything?
- No.

623
00:31:42,734 --> 00:31:43,777
[cellphone beeps]

624
00:31:43,777 --> 00:31:45,070
- Oh, my god.
Call the police.

625
00:31:45,070 --> 00:31:47,823
- I-I-I still don't have
any service, or bars.

626
00:31:47,823 --> 00:31:48,907
But look.

627
00:31:50,408 --> 00:31:53,203
- Wait. Do they mean
your left or my left?

628
00:31:54,496 --> 00:31:56,957
[door hinges creaking]

629
00:31:58,583 --> 00:31:59,835
Alright.

630
00:32:06,591 --> 00:32:07,884
[girl screaming on laptop]

631
00:32:09,052 --> 00:32:11,429
[girl crying on laptop]

632
00:32:11,429 --> 00:32:14,307
ASHLEY: [on laptop]: You guys
make her clap like a seal.

633
00:32:14,307 --> 00:32:15,350
Are you a seal?

634
00:32:15,350 --> 00:32:16,810
Or a walrus with those teeth?

635
00:32:16,810 --> 00:32:18,854
GIRL [on laptop]:
I am like a cat.

636
00:32:18,854 --> 00:32:19,980
ASHLEY [on laptop]:
You're a cat!

637
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:23,024
Somebody needs to cool off!

638
00:32:23,024 --> 00:32:24,776
These people are [indistinct].

639
00:32:24,776 --> 00:32:26,611
JODI: Oh my gosh,
they're so dumb.

640
00:32:26,611 --> 00:32:28,864
[girls laughing]

641
00:32:28,864 --> 00:32:30,282
ASHLEY [on laptop]:
Okay, say the pledge.

642
00:32:30,282 --> 00:32:31,449
- Laura.
ASHLEY: You have one family,

643
00:32:31,449 --> 00:32:33,577
and one family only.
Kappa Kappa Phi.

644
00:32:33,577 --> 00:32:35,537
- That's it. Give it to me.
Come on.

645
00:32:35,537 --> 00:32:37,372
- I have one family,
and one family only.

646
00:32:37,372 --> 00:32:38,623
Kappa Kappa Phi.

647
00:32:38,623 --> 00:32:40,167
- Okay. I don't think
Laura's saying it.

648
00:32:40,167 --> 00:32:42,586
That's the spirit.
It's so good.

649
00:32:44,796 --> 00:32:46,173
[girl screaming]

650
00:32:46,173 --> 00:32:47,883
[girls screaming]

651
00:32:47,883 --> 00:32:49,426
JODI: Alright, now.
Get the fuck out.

652
00:32:50,844 --> 00:32:52,554
- Get up. Go. Go.

653
00:32:57,726 --> 00:32:59,436
- Do you have
a problem, scrub?

654
00:32:59,436 --> 00:33:00,937
[Laura sobbing]

655
00:33:00,937 --> 00:33:05,150
- No. It just--
It just seems a little silly.

656
00:33:05,150 --> 00:33:07,402
- What did you say?

657
00:33:07,402 --> 00:33:10,405
- I have a family.
I have a sister.

658
00:33:10,405 --> 00:33:13,950
- Did I ask you
about your actual sister?

659
00:33:13,950 --> 00:33:15,493
- No.

660
00:33:15,493 --> 00:33:16,828
- Say the pledge.

661
00:33:16,828 --> 00:33:22,125
- [shivering] My family
lied to me my whole life.

662
00:33:22,125 --> 00:33:24,044
I'm not gonna do it.

663
00:33:24,044 --> 00:33:25,045
[whispering]
Isn't that the basic tenet

664
00:33:25,045 --> 00:33:26,755
of Kappa Kappa Phi?

665
00:33:26,755 --> 00:33:28,173
Honesty?

666
00:33:28,173 --> 00:33:31,426
- Yup. Super important.
Say the pledge.

667
00:33:32,510 --> 00:33:34,012
- No.

668
00:33:34,012 --> 00:33:37,057
- Oh, it's so cute.
Did your family get it for you?

669
00:33:40,310 --> 00:33:41,561
Last chance.

670
00:33:42,938 --> 00:33:43,939
- No.

671
00:33:45,565 --> 00:33:47,025
- Ice her down.

672
00:33:47,025 --> 00:33:50,028
Don't let her up
until she's changed her mind.

673
00:33:50,028 --> 00:33:51,029
- Okay.

674
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:53,823
JODI: Sister, come on.
What is happening?

675
00:33:53,823 --> 00:33:55,450
This could've
all been avoided.

676
00:33:55,450 --> 00:33:57,327
- You should have
just said the pledge.

677
00:33:57,327 --> 00:34:00,330
CARLY: [indistinct].
[girls laughing]

678
00:34:00,330 --> 00:34:02,499
Oops.

679
00:34:02,499 --> 00:34:05,502
- Just leave her there
until she changes her mind.

680
00:34:05,502 --> 00:34:07,212
- Okay.
I think she gets it.

681
00:34:07,212 --> 00:34:09,798
- What did you say?
[Shauna gasps]

682
00:34:09,798 --> 00:34:11,216
TULSI: Did you just push me?

683
00:34:11,216 --> 00:34:12,300
ASHLEY: Uh, yeah.
Oh, I'm sorry.

684
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:13,927
Do you want to go
pray on it, Tulsi?

685
00:34:13,927 --> 00:34:15,011
CARLY: Guys, I'm scared.

686
00:34:15,011 --> 00:34:16,471
JODI: Can we just turn
the lights on--

687
00:34:16,471 --> 00:34:17,305
CARLY: You guys, I'm scared.
JODI: This is ridiculous.

688
00:34:17,305 --> 00:34:19,724
ASHLEY: Very funny, Laura.

689
00:34:19,724 --> 00:34:22,227
CARLY: Laura? Laura!

690
00:34:22,227 --> 00:34:23,687
[Ashley clapping]

691
00:34:23,687 --> 00:34:26,439
- And the Oscar goes to Laura.

692
00:34:26,439 --> 00:34:28,650
Congratulations.
No one's buying it.

693
00:34:28,650 --> 00:34:31,278
- No, no, no. I-I think
she's been electrocuted!

694
00:34:31,278 --> 00:34:32,570
- Oh, my God.
We have to get her out.

695
00:34:32,570 --> 00:34:33,947
- What! No!
You'll get lit up too.

696
00:34:33,947 --> 00:34:36,658
- Oh my God. Unplug it.
Unplug it. Come on.

697
00:34:36,658 --> 00:34:39,286
CARLY: Oh, my God. Oh, my god!
You guys, I think she's dead!

698
00:34:39,286 --> 00:34:41,079
JODI: Help!
Somebody, call a doctor.

699
00:34:41,079 --> 00:34:43,123
ASHLEY: Nobody
is calling a doctor.

700
00:34:43,123 --> 00:34:45,083
This was an accident,
because if it wasn't,

701
00:34:45,083 --> 00:34:47,877
we would all be going to jail.

702
00:34:47,877 --> 00:34:49,546
Laura died in a fire.

703
00:34:50,922 --> 00:34:52,090
TULSI: What fire?

704
00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:54,301
ASHLEY: The one
we're about to set, Tulsi.

705
00:34:54,301 --> 00:34:57,554
Why are you still filming this,
Karen? Shut it.

706
00:34:57,554 --> 00:34:58,680
NINA: Come on.

707
00:35:02,559 --> 00:35:04,811
- I can get out,
through the chimney.

708
00:35:05,937 --> 00:35:08,398
MAXINE: What?
Yeah. If you wanna die.

709
00:35:08,398 --> 00:35:10,108
- [chuckling] Not a chance.

710
00:35:10,108 --> 00:35:12,569
I took rock climbing
for my PE credit.

711
00:35:12,569 --> 00:35:15,196
- Oh, so that makes you
an expert.

712
00:35:15,196 --> 00:35:16,448
- Basically.

713
00:35:29,294 --> 00:35:30,295
- Carly.

714
00:35:30,295 --> 00:35:32,380
[Carly grunting]

715
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:33,506
CARLY: Eww!

716
00:35:33,506 --> 00:35:34,841
Eww, was that a bird?

717
00:35:34,841 --> 00:35:36,301
- [gasps] The chimney's alive!

718
00:35:37,594 --> 00:35:39,804
- How did you get into college?

719
00:35:39,804 --> 00:35:41,473
Carly's trying to climb out.

720
00:35:45,226 --> 00:35:47,228
CARLY: I'm already halfway up.

721
00:35:47,228 --> 00:35:50,523
MAXINE: Carly, keep climbing.

722
00:35:50,523 --> 00:35:52,192
Oh, crap!

723
00:35:52,192 --> 00:35:54,402
- What the heck?
Turn that off.

724
00:35:55,779 --> 00:35:57,697
[Maxine shrieks]

725
00:35:57,697 --> 00:35:58,990
- Shit!

726
00:35:58,990 --> 00:36:00,658
Carly, I can't turn it off.

727
00:36:00,658 --> 00:36:03,828
Just keep climbing. Climb.

728
00:36:03,828 --> 00:36:05,121
- Hey! What's going on?
What's happening?

729
00:36:05,121 --> 00:36:06,498
- Carly's trying to
climb out the chimney.

730
00:36:06,498 --> 00:36:08,291
- What?
CARLY: I'm gonna make it.

731
00:36:08,291 --> 00:36:09,459
MAXINE: Carly, keep going.

732
00:36:09,459 --> 00:36:12,420
Do not look down.
Keep on climbing.

733
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:14,756
CARLY: I'm almost there.
A couple more feet.

734
00:36:19,010 --> 00:36:20,595
[Carly screams]
- Carly, you can do it.

735
00:36:20,595 --> 00:36:21,971
- Come on, Carly.

736
00:36:23,306 --> 00:36:24,516
- I'm gonna make it.

737
00:36:25,725 --> 00:36:26,726
I'm gonna make--

738
00:36:31,523 --> 00:36:32,524
MAXINE: Carly?

739
00:36:33,775 --> 00:36:36,111
Carly, did you make it?

740
00:36:38,988 --> 00:36:40,490
I think she made it,
I think she made it.

741
00:36:40,490 --> 00:36:43,410
[thud]
[all screaming]

742
00:36:43,410 --> 00:36:45,954
[all panting]

743
00:36:46,955 --> 00:36:48,248
- What the hell happened?

744
00:36:48,248 --> 00:36:50,375
- She lied, Ashley.
And she died.

745
00:36:53,711 --> 00:36:54,712
[Ashley screaming]

746
00:36:58,383 --> 00:36:59,676
<i> SHAUNA: They all lied.</i>

747
00:36:59,676 --> 00:37:01,010
They killed my sister,

748
00:37:01,010 --> 00:37:02,804
and then they covered up
her murder with a fire.

749
00:37:02,804 --> 00:37:03,888
- Yeah right, psycho.

750
00:37:03,888 --> 00:37:05,557
You know, that's a lie.

751
00:37:07,183 --> 00:37:10,186
NINA: Okay. Enough. Stop.

752
00:37:10,186 --> 00:37:11,855
Whatever you are, just stop.

753
00:37:11,855 --> 00:37:14,441
SHAUNA: It's okay.
It's okay. We're fine.

754
00:37:14,441 --> 00:37:15,442
MAXINE: I'm dead.

755
00:37:17,485 --> 00:37:18,653
SHAUNA: Shit, me too.

756
00:37:18,653 --> 00:37:19,779
MAXINE: I have a lighter.

757
00:37:21,030 --> 00:37:22,907
[lighter flickers]

758
00:37:25,326 --> 00:37:27,036
NINA: What's on your face?

759
00:37:27,036 --> 00:37:28,288
MAXINE: What do you mean?

760
00:37:28,288 --> 00:37:30,498
NINA: You have Kappa Kappa Phi
written on it.

761
00:37:30,498 --> 00:37:32,250
MAXINE: You too.

762
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:33,418
Did you do this?

763
00:37:33,418 --> 00:37:34,794
ASHLEY: Yeah.
When the lights went out,

764
00:37:34,794 --> 00:37:36,796
I scooped up some of
Carly's burnt remains,

765
00:37:36,796 --> 00:37:38,756
smeared Kappa Kappa Phi
on all of your foreheads,

766
00:37:38,756 --> 00:37:41,426
in the dark, in 15 seconds
without any of you noticing,

767
00:37:41,426 --> 00:37:42,886
'cause I'm magic.

768
00:37:45,763 --> 00:37:48,224
What? What the hell
are you all looking at?

769
00:37:49,976 --> 00:37:51,936
Why are you all looking at me?

770
00:37:52,937 --> 00:37:55,190
- I strongly suggest
that you tell the truth, Ashley.

771
00:37:55,190 --> 00:37:57,025
- No.
No, you get away from me.

772
00:37:58,276 --> 00:38:00,111
[Ashley screaming]

773
00:38:00,111 --> 00:38:03,114
[running footsteps]

774
00:38:18,046 --> 00:38:21,674
[sobbing]
What is happening?

775
00:38:21,674 --> 00:38:24,010
- Ashley, it's time for you
to tell the truth.

776
00:38:24,010 --> 00:38:26,304
I've seen the video,
and it was you

777
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:27,805
who told the other girls
to lie,

778
00:38:27,805 --> 00:38:28,806
and look what happened to them.

779
00:38:28,806 --> 00:38:29,849
- I didn't lie.

780
00:38:29,849 --> 00:38:31,893
Your sister died in a fire.

781
00:38:31,893 --> 00:38:34,354
- [eerie whisper]
You lie!

782
00:38:34,354 --> 00:38:38,525
- [gasps]
What is happening?

783
00:38:38,525 --> 00:38:40,610
- Wrong answer.

784
00:38:40,610 --> 00:38:43,321
I can't help you
if you don't help yourself.

785
00:38:43,321 --> 00:38:45,615
- I didn't do anything.
I didn't lie.

786
00:38:45,615 --> 00:38:47,575
What is happening?

787
00:38:47,575 --> 00:38:50,995
[Ashley sobbing and panting]

788
00:38:53,957 --> 00:38:55,750
- [in Laura's voice]:
You've all been marked,

789
00:38:55,750 --> 00:38:57,293
and you are now my sisters.

790
00:38:58,711 --> 00:39:02,549
- Ashley, what the hell?

791
00:39:02,549 --> 00:39:03,967
- [in Laura's voice]:
No more hazing,

792
00:39:03,967 --> 00:39:05,385
no more hurting each other,

793
00:39:05,385 --> 00:39:09,722
no more cheating,
and no more lies.

794
00:39:09,722 --> 00:39:11,641
Not in this house.

795
00:39:11,641 --> 00:39:14,894
You are all Kappa Kappa Phi.

796
00:39:14,894 --> 00:39:16,521
[echoing] We are now a family.

797
00:39:16,521 --> 00:39:18,815
And we are loyal to each other.

798
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:21,568
- Laura.

799
00:39:23,403 --> 00:39:25,113
- Hey, Iggy.

800
00:39:25,113 --> 00:39:28,032
- I knew it was you.
I knew it.

801
00:39:33,121 --> 00:39:34,581
[water splashing softly]

802
00:39:34,581 --> 00:39:37,208
- You remember that summer
when Mom left us all alone?

803
00:39:39,627 --> 00:39:42,088
I hugged you, and you remember
what I said to you.

804
00:39:45,049 --> 00:39:47,594
I said it doesn't matter
who leaves...

805
00:39:47,594 --> 00:39:49,470
It matters who stays.
- It matters who stays.

806
00:39:50,930 --> 00:39:52,724
But you did this.

807
00:39:52,724 --> 00:39:55,518
You killed all of those girls.
Why?

808
00:39:55,518 --> 00:39:56,728
- To protect you.

809
00:39:58,187 --> 00:39:59,606
To protect all of you.

810
00:40:00,898 --> 00:40:03,276
Those girls were monsters, Iggy.

811
00:40:03,276 --> 00:40:06,154
- Laura, your death
was an accident.

812
00:40:06,154 --> 00:40:09,115
- You call the fire an accident?

813
00:40:09,115 --> 00:40:11,200
[electricity sparking]

814
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:13,786
They set the house on fire
to hide the truth.

815
00:40:13,786 --> 00:40:15,371
Sisters don't lie to each other,

816
00:40:15,371 --> 00:40:17,290
and sisters
don't hurt each other.

817
00:40:17,290 --> 00:40:18,666
- You're right, they shouldn't.

818
00:40:20,126 --> 00:40:22,670
It was out of fear,
and what they did was wrong.

819
00:40:24,005 --> 00:40:25,298
But it wasn't murder.

820
00:40:26,507 --> 00:40:28,801
- How can you defend them,

821
00:40:28,801 --> 00:40:31,638
after you watched
what they did to me,

822
00:40:31,638 --> 00:40:33,139
how they hurt me...

823
00:40:35,141 --> 00:40:37,852
and left me all alone,
and took you from me...

824
00:40:39,354 --> 00:40:40,605
and tore us apart?

825
00:40:40,605 --> 00:40:42,565
What about our pledge, Iggy?

826
00:40:44,192 --> 00:40:45,902
What about you and me?

827
00:40:45,902 --> 00:40:47,862
- When I lost you,

828
00:40:47,862 --> 00:40:50,073
I didn't think I could
ever be whole again.

829
00:40:50,073 --> 00:40:51,699
[Shauna sobbing]

830
00:40:51,699 --> 00:40:55,370
And now you're back,
still protecting me,

831
00:40:55,370 --> 00:40:56,996
even when you're gone.

832
00:40:58,456 --> 00:41:00,291
- I'll always protect you,
kiddo.

833
00:41:01,709 --> 00:41:03,252
- I love you so much.

834
00:41:04,796 --> 00:41:06,923
But I don't need you
to take care of me anymore.

835
00:41:09,050 --> 00:41:11,761
I'm strong because
you were my sister.

836
00:41:14,305 --> 00:41:17,767
Whatever you're going to do,
stop, please. Okay?

837
00:41:17,767 --> 00:41:20,019
No more killing,
not for me.

838
00:41:21,145 --> 00:41:23,356
You have to promise me.

839
00:41:23,356 --> 00:41:25,817
- Okay. I promise.

840
00:41:26,984 --> 00:41:29,487
No more killing...

841
00:41:29,487 --> 00:41:32,281

842
00:41:33,324 --> 00:41:34,909
...after this one.

843
00:41:35,910 --> 00:41:38,204
- Laura, no!

844
00:41:38,204 --> 00:41:40,289
[electricity sparking]

845
00:41:44,502 --> 00:41:45,670
- Shit!

[electricity crackling]

847

- [water bubbling]
- [Shauna sobbing]

848
00:42:01,310 --> 00:42:02,520
- I'm getting out of here.

849

- [eerie whisper]
You lie, you die!

being shut down,
it's been decided

853
00:42:21,664 --> 00:42:23,624
that Kappa Kappa Phi
sorority house

854
00:42:23,624 --> 00:42:26,085

pending an investigation

855

into the deaths
of several of its members.

That said, ahem, parties
broke out everywhere

857
00:42:33,593 --> 00:42:37,346
when it was announced that the
rest of Greek Row can reopen.

[cheering and shouting]

859
00:42:39,056 --> 00:42:40,808
Okay. Obviously,
cut the last part.

860
00:42:40,808 --> 00:42:44,395
And get the hell out of here.
Fucking frat boys.

[♪♪♪]

862
00:42:46,814 --> 00:42:49,567
- I mean, I think
it's the right thing.

- VOICE: [eerie whisper]
You lie...

864

You know, no one should ever

865
00:42:55,198 --> 00:42:56,741
- Uh-huh.

866
00:42:56,741 --> 00:43:00,953
- I love her, but my hope is
that they tear that house down.

867
00:43:03,247 --> 00:43:06,083
Sorry, am I still talking?
You must--

868
00:43:06,083 --> 00:43:08,669
you must think
I'm a crazy person.

869
00:43:08,669 --> 00:43:10,922
- I absolutely do not.

870
00:43:13,424 --> 00:43:16,511
- Stewart! Did you hear
anything I just said?

871
00:43:16,511 --> 00:43:18,012
Are you just pretending
to listen to me

872
00:43:18,012 --> 00:43:19,764
so you can hook up with me?

873
00:43:19,764 --> 00:43:20,973
- No.

00:43:26,354 --> 00:43:27,563
- Noooo!

877
00:43:30,149 --> 00:43:32,401
Sex is the last thing
on my mind.

00:43:34,737 --> 00:43:35,738
