00:00:23,656 --> 00:00:25,988
The War of the Worlds 2:
THE NEXT WAVE.

2
00:00:26,059 --> 00:00:28,550
Nobody saw it coming.

3
00:00:28,595 --> 00:00:33,032
Thousands of astronomers looked at
Sky looking for extraterrestrial life.

4
00:00:33,066 --> 00:00:36,194
But I never knew what hit us.

5
00:00:37,971 --> 00:00:41,270
The initial attack was
global and devastating.

6
00:00:41,307 --> 00:00:44,504
While sailed on the Internet
and queuing to buy one ...

7
00:00:44,577 --> 00:00:48,069
coffee with soy milk, they just
one thing needed to survive.

8
00:00:48,114 --> 00:00:50,480
Our blood.

9
00:00:51,785 --> 00:00:56,586
But as we harvested,
there was something we did not.

10
00:00:56,623 --> 00:00:59,421
Fought.

11
00:00:59,492 --> 00:01:03,428
All the armies of the world,
all inhabitants of the Earth ...

12
00:01:03,463 --> 00:01:08,127
to the last microbe came together to
send them to where they came.

13
00:01:10,270 --> 00:01:12,397
And all over.

14
00:01:12,439 --> 00:01:14,771
TWO YEARS LATER.

15
00:01:14,841 --> 00:01:21,337
For some, the nightmare began.

16
00:02:08,828 --> 00:02:10,455
Come on!

17
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:15,629
No!

18
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:20,737
Sissi! Sissi!

19
00:02:27,247 --> 00:02:29,340
Sissi!

20
00:03:20,433 --> 00:03:23,129
- Bye.
- No. Do not leave me!

21
00:03:23,169 --> 00:03:24,864
- Let go.
- No!

22
00:03:24,938 --> 00:03:26,633
I will be fine!

23
00:04:52,158 --> 00:04:55,423
- Dad!
- No, Dad.

24
00:04:55,461 --> 00:04:58,123
I have to listen to the base
always know the rules.

25
00:04:58,164 --> 00:05:01,361
Always speak the same, blah, blah, blah.

26
00:05:01,401 --> 00:05:05,098
That is, fill the battery
up to half, good work.

27
00:05:09,809 --> 00:05:11,743
Got to work tonight?

28
00:05:11,811 --> 00:05:16,748
Tonight, tomorrow, any
night, you know son.

29
00:05:20,053 --> 00:05:21,645
Happy birthday, Dad.

30
00:05:24,524 --> 00:05:25,548
What?

31
00:05:26,626 --> 00:05:29,618
I have marked the days,
So congratulations.

32
00:05:33,366 --> 00:05:36,597
- Where did you get this?
- Spongers.

33
00:05:36,636 --> 00:05:43,064
Spongers? What I have said
that? Do not leave here without me.

34
00:05:43,142 --> 00:05:46,976
How surprised if you never
are you? I do not spend anything.

35
00:05:47,046 --> 00:05:50,675
- How do you know?
- Will die of boredom.

36
00:06:01,794 --> 00:06:03,625
Alex.

37
00:06:03,696 --> 00:06:06,358
Thank you for remembering my birthday.

38
00:06:06,399 --> 00:06:09,425
You have to understand that
you are everything I have.

39
00:06:09,502 --> 00:06:10,833
I know.

40
00:06:13,005 --> 00:06:16,099
- I will make dinner.
- Congratulations.

41
00:07:52,438 --> 00:07:54,599
Good morning, Dad.

42
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:59,134
I made breakfast, beans are
can, but imagine we are arepas.

43
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:10,786
Alex, get off the bike and get to safety.

44
00:08:37,817 --> 00:08:40,809
These are the only batteries.

45
00:08:43,155 --> 00:08:46,955
If you promise to stay here until
I return, I will bring more. Okay?

46
00:08:46,993 --> 00:08:50,690
- How long?
- 7 or 8 hours.

47
00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:54,325
- That is eternal.
- Do you have chips.

48
00:08:54,367 --> 00:08:56,096
Old.

49
00:08:56,135 --> 00:09:01,402
I saved it. Soda and
chips, and will be a feast.

50
00:09:03,609 --> 00:09:07,340
- I can go with you.
- We talked about that.

51
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:11,476
I know there is no outside. Wait here.

52
00:09:12,385 --> 00:09:14,546
This is dark, and there is plenty cold.

53
00:09:14,587 --> 00:09:16,851
Do not remove the coat.

54
00:09:16,889 --> 00:09:22,088
There are two matches. No
let the candle goes out.

55
00:09:22,995 --> 00:09:24,895
I have an idea.

56
00:09:27,133 --> 00:09:30,500
This is my watch. The
alarm at 8 hours.

57
00:09:30,536 --> 00:09:33,733
I'll be back before
that sounds, I promise.

58
00:09:37,109 --> 00:09:39,441
You're a good man.

59
00:10:10,543 --> 00:10:14,877
Base and Laboratory Troops Free.

60
00:10:35,868 --> 00:10:38,268
Sixteen.

61
00:10:41,707 --> 00:10:45,199
- George.
- How are you, Nate?

62
00:10:45,277 --> 00:10:47,006
Glad to see you.

63
00:10:47,079 --> 00:10:49,809
- Do you know Victoria?
- Victoria Reilly is a pleasure.

64
00:10:49,882 --> 00:10:52,282
He worked for NASA when NASA had.

65
00:10:52,318 --> 00:10:56,049
Would participate in the
ferry before the invasion.

66
00:10:56,088 --> 00:10:59,114
Helps us to decode
language of the roads.

67
00:10:59,191 --> 00:11:01,386
- How is that?
- After the first invasion ...

68
00:11:01,427 --> 00:11:04,260
capture some of the roads.
We are decoding.

69
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:07,697
We could replace some
codes and to understand some things ...

70
00:11:07,733 --> 00:11:10,167
but we lack the key.

71
00:11:11,437 --> 00:11:14,531
- For better work fast.
- Why?

72
00:11:14,573 --> 00:11:17,041
I think they have returned.

73
00:11:22,448 --> 00:11:24,916
There are events here, here and here.

74
00:11:24,950 --> 00:11:29,785
The interesting thing is that they are just
outside the Earth's magnetic pole.

75
00:11:29,855 --> 00:11:32,517
- When to get that data?
- 4 days ago.

76
00:11:32,558 --> 00:11:36,494
- Do you say that about a vortex?
- A change in the field.

77
00:11:36,562 --> 00:11:38,792
- The effect Sorshire?
- Possibly.

78
00:11:38,864 --> 00:11:41,492
- What is that?
- A hole reversible ...

79
00:11:41,567 --> 00:11:43,535
collapsing time and space.

80
00:11:43,569 --> 00:11:45,366
It is a theory.

81
00:11:45,404 --> 00:11:47,668
And life
extraterrestrial, but ...

82
00:11:47,707 --> 00:11:50,403
We did many tests simulated
before launching the shuttle.

83
00:11:50,476 --> 00:11:52,569
None included a hole.

84
00:11:53,512 --> 00:11:54,911
What are you doing?

85
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:57,949
Takes you from point A to B
Jumping Imperceptibles time.

86
00:11:57,983 --> 00:12:03,182
- Could you go from here to Mars ...?
- A nanosecond.

87
00:12:03,222 --> 00:12:06,453
- Exactly.
- And we did not see coming the first invasion.

88
00:12:06,525 --> 00:12:09,688
- Exactly.
- NASA did not detect anything.

89
00:12:09,729 --> 00:12:12,823
No data or evidence
until it was over.

90
00:12:12,865 --> 00:12:16,392
I confirmed my speculations
by the sounds of radio.

91
00:12:16,435 --> 00:12:18,767
- What is your DC component?
- Batteries.

92
00:12:18,838 --> 00:12:20,738
Then only speculate.

93
00:12:20,773 --> 00:12:23,867
That's why I came, you
have the equipment, not me.

94
00:12:23,943 --> 00:12:26,673
We could analyze the sound
and isolate the frequencies.

95
00:12:26,746 --> 00:12:29,340
- Victoria, review.
- Claro.

96
00:12:29,381 --> 00:12:31,747
If there is a pattern
intelligent, it will find.

97
00:12:32,852 --> 00:12:35,218
Victoria seems to know what you are talking about.

98
00:12:35,254 --> 00:12:40,624
George, it should work
here. Us.

99
00:12:40,659 --> 00:12:43,856
Come live here, you
and Alex, it is safer.

100
00:12:43,896 --> 00:12:46,296
We have other children,
until we have school. 

101
00:12:48,801 --> 00:12:50,996
Think about it. We can use you.

102
00:12:52,271 --> 00:12:54,171
Come, let me show you something.

103
00:13:00,412 --> 00:13:03,347
This is part of what we do.

104
00:13:03,415 --> 00:13:06,145
Died on the roads
first invasion because of a virus.

105
00:13:06,218 --> 00:13:09,483
We have experimented with different
types, creating a mejunje.

106
00:13:09,522 --> 00:13:15,427
- Does she know?
- She created it. Working with us.

107
00:13:16,529 --> 00:13:18,292
The virus is the key.

108
00:13:18,330 --> 00:13:22,130
We are sure that the removed.

109
00:13:23,135 --> 00:13:24,625
Follow me.

110
00:13:29,074 --> 00:13:32,339
This is what remains of the
first-line defenses. The fleet.

111
00:13:33,379 --> 00:13:36,314
- They seem to F22.
- Improved technology.

112
00:13:36,348 --> 00:13:39,943
- How is that?
- Victoria created a code ...

113
00:13:39,985 --> 00:13:44,684
allowed us to steal technology.

114
00:13:46,091 --> 00:13:49,083
We feedback to these
fighter to fight in space.

115
00:13:49,161 --> 00:13:52,062
- Among other things.
- What is the range of altitude?

116
00:13:52,097 --> 00:13:56,124
That is the problem. We know
that reach the mesosphere.

117
00:13:56,168 --> 00:13:59,160
But we're not sure
reaching the exosfera.

118
00:14:00,406 --> 00:14:05,070
- They need to redesign the code.
- Right. For that is the walker.

119
00:14:05,110 --> 00:14:09,376
We know that there is a field that
protected when they enter the exosfera.

120
00:14:09,415 --> 00:14:11,906
I teach you a thing.

121
00:14:18,257 --> 00:14:21,021
- Is that ...?
- Yes. That's it.

122
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:24,723
Dead? Was he alive?

123
00:14:25,764 --> 00:14:28,324
- I believe.
- The ship was a way of life?

124
00:14:28,367 --> 00:14:31,962
Ciberbiótico. It's like
anything we've seen.

125
00:14:32,037 --> 00:14:35,734
- We will steal the technology of this ship.
- Are you sure you're dead?

126
00:14:37,142 --> 00:14:40,077
God, I hope. Victoria is within.

127
00:14:40,145 --> 00:14:41,737
Let's see.

128
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:47,917
We believe this is
a cell of some sort.

129
00:14:47,953 --> 00:14:52,515
There were witnesses who saw took
people to the belly of the ship.

130
00:14:52,558 --> 00:14:56,494
What happened next ... good.

131
00:14:56,562 --> 00:14:59,861
Gentlemen, I want to see this.

132
00:15:10,342 --> 00:15:12,902
- Where are we now?
- In the control center.

133
00:15:14,413 --> 00:15:17,644
- No windows or fixed geometry?
- Right.

134
00:15:17,716 --> 00:15:22,153
But I noticed that this leads
this vortex generator.

135
00:15:23,255 --> 00:15:28,955
Or so we thought. But in reality what
see is a UHF frequency modulator.

136
00:15:29,028 --> 00:15:31,428
Well ... comparatively.

137
00:15:31,463 --> 00:15:34,955
- How a transmitter?
- Right.

138
00:15:35,034 --> 00:15:38,435
Comunica mother to mother
these roads.

139
00:15:38,470 --> 00:15:43,339
Uses satellites as our beacon.
We already knew that the transmission ...

140
00:15:43,375 --> 00:15:46,435
of them using a string of
octagonal complex numbers ...

141
00:15:46,478 --> 00:15:52,007
but so far my team has not
able to translate anything. However ...

142
00:15:52,051 --> 00:15:56,988
once introduced algorithms
of its signal, Mr. Herbert ...

143
00:15:57,056 --> 00:16:01,015
discovery of a code. Look at this.

144
00:16:19,411 --> 00:16:21,345
Are you alive?

145
00:16:21,413 --> 00:16:26,112
Yes, I try to tell. Introduced
frequency signal y. .. iPum!

146
00:16:26,151 --> 00:16:28,449
- Unbelievable.
- That is the key.

147
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:30,249
Notify the Mayor.

148
00:16:32,424 --> 00:16:34,722
Very good job!

149
00:16:35,828 --> 00:16:39,958
- Cramer Mayor, we need to talk.
- Damn, look who came!

150
00:16:40,032 --> 00:16:42,330
- Hello, sir.
- Glad to see you, George.

151
00:16:42,368 --> 00:16:44,632
How is your wife?

152
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:53,803
- Sorry, George. And Alex?
- Well, it grows fast.

153
00:16:53,846 --> 00:16:56,974
Good. Met
George when the invasion.

154
00:16:57,049 --> 00:16:59,279
We live together in a time Blackwater.

155
00:17:00,319 --> 00:17:02,184
Tremendous family.

156
00:17:03,689 --> 00:17:05,987
I am delighted that Alex is okay.

157
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:08,118
Thank you, sir.

158
00:17:08,193 --> 00:17:10,457
We believe we found the key.

159
00:17:10,496 --> 00:17:15,433
Calculates the trajectory, and I think
I found the source of the next attack.

160
00:17:15,501 --> 00:17:18,231
There is a possible entry into Rosenbridge.

161
00:17:18,270 --> 00:17:21,797
- A leap in time?
- We saw it in my telescope.

162
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:26,277
They are 400 square miles.
This was last week.

163
00:17:27,246 --> 00:17:29,146
Look at this.

164
00:17:29,214 --> 00:17:31,239
This was 4 days.

165
00:17:31,283 --> 00:17:34,184
Is this a sunspot or something?

166
00:17:34,219 --> 00:17:36,551
I think that's mother's mother.

167
00:17:36,622 --> 00:17:40,353
That is the big spot.
And these dots?

168
00:17:40,426 --> 00:17:44,522
Cree ships that are lower
leaving the hole.

169
00:17:44,563 --> 00:17:47,031
Do check it like?

170
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:50,968
Try to repair the connection
the Hubble Space Telescope.

171
00:17:51,036 --> 00:17:54,938
If that still works
can try to find something.

172
00:17:56,642 --> 00:17:59,634
Do this, I must
be sure of this.

173
00:17:59,678 --> 00:18:03,808
George, stay as coordinator,
I've done all of your stuff.

174
00:18:03,882 --> 00:18:06,851
I would like, but I
go home with Alex.

175
00:18:06,885 --> 00:18:11,083
Bring it to the base. And while
Take care of connecting to the telescope.

176
00:18:11,123 --> 00:18:13,683
Vicky, the ships
ready urgently.

177
00:18:45,224 --> 00:18:47,818
Oh, no, the tank is
empty. Damn.

178
00:19:23,795 --> 00:19:25,820
Sorry.

179
00:19:25,898 --> 00:19:27,593
I need fuel.

180
00:19:33,705 --> 00:19:36,105
Thank you.

181
00:20:25,190 --> 00:20:28,091
Just come by gasoline.

182
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:33,393
I stayed a few miles away empty
ago. You are my salvation.

183
00:20:33,465 --> 00:20:35,456
What do you have?

184
00:20:39,404 --> 00:20:42,271
Vouchers for food for two weeks.

185
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:50,207
Four coupons ...

186
00:20:52,417 --> 00:20:53,884
Three gallons.

187
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:57,288
Three gallons? This applies as 10 gallons.

188
00:20:58,390 --> 00:21:00,255
10 gallons?

189
00:21:02,027 --> 00:21:03,255
Look, Ok.

190
00:21:03,328 --> 00:21:08,322
If you give me your watch, I give you 4 gallons.

191
00:21:11,837 --> 00:21:16,433
- I have nothing.
- It's not your lucky day.

192
00:21:18,543 --> 00:21:19,942
Dale 3 gallons.

193
00:21:38,163 --> 00:21:40,597
- Bastards.
- Have a nice day.

194
00:22:02,154 --> 00:22:04,622
Dad?

195
00:22:06,124 --> 00:22:07,523
Dad!

196
00:22:37,389 --> 00:22:38,981
¡Alex, no!

197
00:23:24,636 --> 00:23:27,298
Why?

198
00:23:27,339 --> 00:23:30,604
Why am I doing this?

199
00:23:30,642 --> 00:23:33,634
I am not the asshole Job!

200
00:23:33,678 --> 00:23:38,945
You can not steal my wife,
my son, my life, and leave me here!

201
00:23:42,154 --> 00:23:47,820
The alarm is set for 8
hours. I'll be back before the ring.

202
00:23:47,859 --> 00:23:49,986
I do not spend anything.

203
00:23:51,363 --> 00:23:54,059
Sorry, Alex.

204
00:23:56,601 --> 00:23:59,661
I am so sorry.

205
00:24:03,108 --> 00:24:06,271
Witnesses report that took
people to the belly of the ship.

206
00:24:06,311 --> 00:24:09,508
What happened then ... nobody knows.

207
00:24:19,357 --> 00:24:21,325
You find.

208
00:24:24,963 --> 00:24:27,659
I'll find you.

209
00:26:24,249 --> 00:26:26,513
Go! Go here!

210
00:26:39,931 --> 00:26:41,956
What do you expect?

211
00:26:49,741 --> 00:26:52,039
What are you waiting for?

212
00:27:28,313 --> 00:27:31,441
You're not dead, if what you thought.

213
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:38,348
- We are alive.
- For now, yes.

214
00:27:38,423 --> 00:27:41,256
Accept what is, and be grateful.

215
00:27:41,326 --> 00:27:46,389
I find my son, Alex.

216
00:27:46,431 --> 00:27:50,527
Do not run, man.
I told you to flee.

217
00:27:50,568 --> 00:27:54,629
They should see it. You
faced with this asshole.

218
00:27:55,740 --> 00:27:59,073
- Thanks for trying.
- You should escape.

219
00:27:59,144 --> 00:28:02,079
No, like I was caught.

220
00:28:15,093 --> 00:28:17,561
You have to be strong.

221
00:28:17,595 --> 00:28:20,689
Do not be afraid or lose hope.

222
00:28:20,732 --> 00:28:23,633
God, our Lord is with you.

223
00:28:32,644 --> 00:28:34,544
This is bullshit!

224
00:28:34,612 --> 00:28:36,773
I have been inside
one of these before.

225
00:28:36,815 --> 00:28:40,444
Well, show me the output
and out of here.

226
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:44,112
It is not so simple.

227
00:28:44,155 --> 00:28:47,852
We have not gone away.
We remain on Earth. No?

228
00:29:10,982 --> 00:29:13,815
Trying to kill us or what?

229
00:29:14,819 --> 00:29:16,787
There must be a way out.

230
00:29:17,589 --> 00:29:20,080
You must know.

231
00:29:21,025 --> 00:29:24,426
Not that I thought would happen.
I do not like.

232
00:29:24,496 --> 00:29:26,293
I have to find my son.

233
00:29:43,848 --> 00:29:45,873
- Mayor.
- How far?

234
00:29:45,917 --> 00:29:48,351
We work fast, but
we must make a plan B.

235
00:29:48,419 --> 00:29:51,183
There is no plan B. Must
attacking the mother ship.

236
00:29:51,222 --> 00:29:53,918
These ships are not more
beyond 150 km. and knows it.

237
00:29:53,958 --> 00:29:56,825
Need to go at least 600 km.
in order to attack this thing.

238
00:29:56,861 --> 00:29:59,022
You can do work faster.

239
00:29:59,063 --> 00:30:02,055
- Raya.
- Mr.

240
00:30:02,133 --> 00:30:04,328
- Talk to me.
- It's difficult but we will.

241
00:30:04,369 --> 00:30:07,827
We have uploaded infectious agents
lung in aircraft.

242
00:30:07,872 --> 00:30:10,397
- But not just yet.
- How many are loaded?

243
00:30:10,441 --> 00:30:12,466
- This ship has 5.
- Virus?

244
00:30:12,544 --> 00:30:14,535
- Yes.
- Raya, we are there.

245
00:30:15,547 --> 00:30:16,775
Lord.

246
00:30:16,848 --> 00:30:21,251
- You should design a ground assault.
- Tell her to work faster.

247
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:54,081
Norman, as are we going? My squad must
go to exosfera. We need protection.

248
00:30:54,118 --> 00:30:57,884
I'm going codes
should be ready in minutes.

249
00:30:57,922 --> 00:31:00,186
Hopefully coordinates
George work.

250
00:31:00,225 --> 00:31:02,750
That's it. Does the ship moves?

251
00:31:05,730 --> 00:31:08,665
Ok, are in the air already.

252
00:31:15,673 --> 00:31:18,233
Back, back! I have.

253
00:31:34,192 --> 00:31:36,092
What was that?

254
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:39,652
- The sonic barrier, sir.
- What?

255
00:31:39,697 --> 00:31:41,756
They are.

256
00:31:41,799 --> 00:31:43,994
Entered the atmosphere.

257
00:31:50,608 --> 00:31:51,973
- Mayor.
- Tell Vicky we need ...

258
00:31:52,010 --> 00:31:56,640
ships in the air of urgency. If
destroy the ships come ashore.

259
00:31:56,681 --> 00:31:58,979
- Maybe too late already.
- Why, what happened?

260
00:31:59,017 --> 00:32:02,248
There are reports of all
parts of the world.

261
00:32:04,622 --> 00:32:06,317
Has begun the attack.

262
00:32:32,550 --> 00:32:36,646
- Sir, I'm done.
- Start launch.

263
00:32:41,059 --> 00:32:42,856
Sequence starting pitching.

264
00:32:56,774 --> 00:32:58,503
Well, listen.

265
00:32:59,777 --> 00:33:01,506
This is the mission.

266
00:33:01,546 --> 00:33:03,741
Attack the mothership.

267
00:33:03,815 --> 00:33:06,648
Is just outside our atmosphere.

268
00:33:08,219 --> 00:33:12,485
We believe that if we destroy
the mother, the rest will fall.

269
00:33:12,523 --> 00:33:17,324
For most of us,
this is a round trip.

270
00:33:17,362 --> 00:33:20,627
Not everyone can survive.

271
00:33:20,665 --> 00:33:26,626
Follow my instructions. Than
anyone take risky decisions.

272
00:33:27,939 --> 00:33:29,463
Good luck, men.

273
00:33:29,540 --> 00:33:31,132
Ready, Vicky?

274
00:33:39,283 --> 00:33:40,750
Forward.

275
00:33:55,767 --> 00:33:57,826
Guys, I'm not doing that.

276
00:33:57,869 --> 00:34:00,303
Do not worry for now.

277
00:34:01,639 --> 00:34:04,073
We are promoting.

278
00:34:04,108 --> 00:34:09,011
Is only the first stage, we
continue after the launch.

279
00:34:16,888 --> 00:34:19,118
Stay ... quiet.

280
00:35:19,884 --> 00:35:21,749
Come on.

281
00:35:40,171 --> 00:35:42,230
Breathe. ¡Respira!

282
00:35:43,241 --> 00:35:44,731
Follow me.

283
00:35:47,411 --> 00:35:50,972
Come on. Come on!

284
00:35:52,917 --> 00:35:55,044
Do not touch the walls!

285
00:36:17,608 --> 00:36:19,235
Alex!

286
00:36:41,132 --> 00:36:44,533
Pete!

287
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:57,580
It is the second time that I owe you a living.

288
00:36:57,648 --> 00:37:01,015
I have to find my son.

289
00:37:01,085 --> 00:37:05,613
Is this my blood? Is
thing it feeds on us?

290
00:37:08,693 --> 00:37:10,888
Would drown my shit!

291
00:37:17,101 --> 00:37:18,500
Run!

292
00:37:19,537 --> 00:37:21,232
And do not touch the walls!

293
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:39,514
- Help me, help me!
- I got you, do not fight!

294
00:37:54,138 --> 00:37:57,039
We told you not to touch the walls!

295
00:38:17,895 --> 00:38:19,385
And here!

296
00:38:26,804 --> 00:38:30,205
Do not touch the walls, do not touch
walls. And she goes into a?

297
00:38:30,241 --> 00:38:32,709
- He said that follow.
- Where?

298
00:38:32,743 --> 00:38:34,904
I do not know, but we can not stay here.

299
00:38:38,215 --> 00:38:39,409
Shit!

300
00:38:52,229 --> 00:38:54,459
Wait, I think I have something.

301
00:38:54,532 --> 00:38:56,261
No, shit.

302
00:38:56,334 --> 00:38:58,734
- Where are we?
- 20 km.

303
00:38:58,769 --> 00:39:01,670
Is 80 km. before the mesosphere.

304
00:39:03,274 --> 00:39:05,504
Have you managed to run the code?

305
00:39:06,677 --> 00:39:08,702
Still, no?

306
00:39:08,779 --> 00:39:12,374
We need such protection
or all will die!

307
00:39:12,416 --> 00:39:15,044
Still working on the code.

308
00:39:15,086 --> 00:39:17,316
Are still in the atmosphere.

309
00:39:25,896 --> 00:39:27,727
A craft to my right, at 3.

310
00:39:30,401 --> 00:39:34,895
The satellites are to
least two dozen ships.

311
00:39:37,408 --> 00:39:41,435
- Sir, permission to fly.
- Do not fly, stay in formation!

312
00:39:41,512 --> 00:39:43,241
Listen well.

313
00:39:43,314 --> 00:39:46,647
Not attacked. Again, not attacking.

314
00:39:46,717 --> 00:39:49,117
They're too much!

315
00:39:56,060 --> 00:39:59,325
- Alfa, follow me.
- Charlie, stay in formation.

316
00:40:16,180 --> 00:40:18,774
Háblenme. How are we going?

317
00:40:18,849 --> 00:40:20,578
We can not over!

318
00:40:24,555 --> 00:40:26,546
We have fire, sir!

319
00:40:26,590 --> 00:40:31,254
Extinguish the fire, do not use the
weapons. Leave it to the mothership.

320
00:40:31,295 --> 00:40:36,164
- The shield is working.
- How far to go?

321
00:40:37,668 --> 00:40:41,229
- How long do you need?
- 20 minutes.

322
00:40:41,272 --> 00:40:43,399
Stay well 20 minutes.

323
00:40:43,474 --> 00:40:48,275
I can not give you that time, my men
are falling. We must go now.

324
00:40:52,516 --> 00:40:53,983
I have to give half back.

325
00:40:55,820 --> 00:40:57,515
Stay direction.

326
00:40:59,390 --> 00:41:01,756
We are too close, focus.

327
00:41:08,332 --> 00:41:10,562
It is too fast, we can not.

328
00:41:10,634 --> 00:41:12,761
We are approaching the mesosphere.

329
00:41:12,837 --> 00:41:14,828
We have to go now!

330
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:18,572
Still missing 95 km.

331
00:41:20,244 --> 00:41:25,682
If it hurts them.
Again, confirm.

332
00:41:25,749 --> 00:41:27,080
I do not have.

333
00:41:27,151 --> 00:41:30,382
We can not over! The
ship is going to burn!

334
00:41:30,454 --> 00:41:34,788
- 97.
- Get out of there, can not come back.

335
00:41:36,460 --> 00:41:37,859
Load.

336
00:41:37,895 --> 00:41:39,385
I got it!

337
00:41:52,276 --> 00:41:54,767
Work. You succeeded?

338
00:42:08,626 --> 00:42:10,457
We did it!

339
00:42:10,528 --> 00:42:12,723
It was not so difficult. Really?

340
00:42:16,934 --> 00:42:19,767
Thank God they are alive.
Can you see the mother ship?

341
00:42:19,837 --> 00:42:21,065
Repeat.

342
00:42:22,072 --> 00:42:24,165
The ship! Do you see the mother ship?

343
00:42:34,552 --> 00:42:37,646
Yes, base.
We have visual contact.

344
00:42:37,688 --> 00:42:39,952
Is large.

345
00:42:42,459 --> 00:42:44,791
Alfa here. Formulas
to attack the ship.

346
00:43:03,614 --> 00:43:05,047
What is that?

347
00:43:05,115 --> 00:43:08,312
That is white, is
increasing in size.

348
00:43:08,352 --> 00:43:10,752
Base, see this?

349
00:43:13,624 --> 00:43:17,151
- It is an opening.
- An open?

350
00:43:18,228 --> 00:43:20,059
Yes, look.

351
00:43:20,130 --> 00:43:23,156
It is a mass disruption.

352
00:43:23,233 --> 00:43:26,862
Spreads.

353
00:43:28,072 --> 00:43:31,269
Lord, is a gap in time.

354
00:43:38,682 --> 00:43:41,480
What makes the ship?

355
00:43:50,694 --> 00:43:54,061
Lord. I think it
ate to the mothership.

356
00:44:01,238 --> 00:44:03,798
What happened? Where are they?

357
00:44:10,614 --> 00:44:13,481
Quick, write this coordinate.

358
00:44:13,517 --> 00:44:18,978
Z 300. And no 483.

359
00:44:19,023 --> 00:44:22,891
X 59. 65 degrees.

360
00:44:22,926 --> 00:44:26,919
- What is that?
- What just happened.

361
00:44:28,632 --> 00:44:31,829
Dios mio. Where were they?

362
00:44:31,869 --> 00:44:35,430
I guess that was where the mother ship.

363
00:44:57,361 --> 00:45:01,457
- Where are we?
- At home, baby!

364
00:45:01,498 --> 00:45:05,730
We did it, we are
Land. Do not leave the planet.

365
00:45:07,504 --> 00:45:09,096
We went outside.

366
00:45:10,007 --> 00:45:12,407
Something is wrong.

367
00:45:13,811 --> 00:45:18,145
Do you know what was wrong? Whore
chupasangre ship. That was wrong.

368
00:45:20,718 --> 00:45:25,178
- Where you going?
- For the girl who saved us.

369
00:45:25,222 --> 00:45:28,020
If you did that, you can
find the ship again.

370
00:45:28,058 --> 00:45:33,121
Well thought out. Get out, and now
want to return to that nightmare.

371
00:45:34,231 --> 00:45:38,167
Continue on your path, not
I want you to waste your time.

372
00:45:38,235 --> 00:45:41,671
- Can I leave?
- This is my fight!

373
00:45:41,739 --> 00:45:48,702
You fight, really? That thing removed
nearly all my people on the street 32.

374
00:45:48,746 --> 00:45:51,840
The last time they killed my girl.

375
00:45:51,882 --> 00:45:54,680
Think you do not miss
taken by the hand?

376
00:45:54,752 --> 00:45:57,653
Talk to my brother or my mom?

377
00:45:57,688 --> 00:46:00,156
Do you fight? Please.

378
00:46:01,191 --> 00:46:04,217
This not only is
you find your son.

379
00:46:04,294 --> 00:46:06,489
Is somewhat higher than that.

380
00:46:07,731 --> 00:46:10,393
For me this is just
to find my son.

381
00:46:17,808 --> 00:46:20,572
I know this. iLO've seen, man!

382
00:46:20,611 --> 00:46:25,344
Have post-traumatic syndrome!
Facing reality.

383
00:46:31,421 --> 00:46:34,549
My mistake, sorry
sorry. iEspera, wait!

384
00:46:36,727 --> 00:46:39,491
Come on, sorry, sorry.

385
00:46:39,530 --> 00:46:42,260
I have stress syndrome or something.

386
00:46:59,249 --> 00:47:03,310
Based here in the Greater Cramer
the vessel head. Respond please.

387
00:47:07,291 --> 00:47:09,987
Nothing. iHijo of a bitch!

388
00:47:22,906 --> 00:47:24,430
Shit! Watch this.

389
00:47:24,508 --> 00:47:27,068
We will ride in style.

390
00:47:27,110 --> 00:47:30,773
Air conditioning. Such
Having found someone else.

391
00:47:30,814 --> 00:47:33,408
Here are the keys.

392
00:47:36,153 --> 00:47:37,745
The battery is dead.

393
00:47:39,423 --> 00:47:41,755
There are more than one way to turn it on.

394
00:47:50,634 --> 00:47:52,261
It has no motor.

395
00:48:34,945 --> 00:48:36,708
Alfa here.

396
00:48:38,015 --> 00:48:40,609
Someone copying me?

397
00:48:42,052 --> 00:48:45,021
Alfa here. Is anybody there?

398
00:48:46,823 --> 00:48:50,020
- Alpha.
- Raya. God.

399
00:48:51,561 --> 00:48:56,055
¡Alfa Rickler here!
What the hell was that?

400
00:48:56,133 --> 00:48:58,897
We took a leap in time. 

401
00:48:58,936 --> 00:49:03,566
I thought that was shit
lies. Lord. Is that Mars?

402
00:49:09,780 --> 00:49:11,611
Affirmative.

403
00:49:13,383 --> 00:49:16,011
Give me a report of their condition.

404
00:49:17,187 --> 00:49:19,985
The fuel cells to 25%.

405
00:49:21,024 --> 00:49:26,223
Ok. All ships
maintain their current position.

406
00:49:26,296 --> 00:49:30,596
It is best to see what lies ahead.

407
00:49:32,035 --> 00:49:34,026
Copying, Alfa.

408
00:49:44,948 --> 00:49:50,113
Man, that vessel filled me with
fuck. I do not feel well.

409
00:49:50,153 --> 00:49:51,620
Wait.

410
00:49:52,723 --> 00:49:55,556
I need water, I die of thirst.

411
00:49:56,727 --> 00:50:00,026
- This is not right.
- What?

412
00:50:00,063 --> 00:50:02,531
We need a plan. I ...

413
00:50:02,566 --> 00:50:07,196
We need to get on a roof
reviewing the area. See where we are.

414
00:50:07,237 --> 00:50:10,764
Stay here. I'll be back.

415
00:50:11,742 --> 00:50:14,370
Well. Good idea, I'll stay here.

416
00:50:14,444 --> 00:50:15,638
I'm tired.

417
00:50:17,481 --> 00:50:19,073
Go back, right?

418
00:50:21,585 --> 00:50:23,644
That ship sure sucks
throughout the world, George.

419
00:50:23,687 --> 00:50:25,655
Maybe we were just you and me.

420
00:51:16,940 --> 00:51:19,101
Here we are not safe.

421
00:51:19,142 --> 00:51:22,202
- Who are you?
- The same as you.

422
00:51:22,245 --> 00:51:27,808
- Is there more?
- Only one. Is it so disappointing!

423
00:51:27,851 --> 00:51:32,345
Quiet, busco someone.
A child of 10 years, Alex.

424
00:51:33,490 --> 00:51:36,220
- I know Alex.
- Yes?

425
00:51:36,259 --> 00:51:39,353
- Have you seen him?
- Not here. Him ..

426
00:51:39,396 --> 00:51:43,662
- What?
- My brother died with my dad.

427
00:51:44,901 --> 00:51:49,201
- I was alone.
- Sorry.

428
00:51:53,276 --> 00:51:55,267
I do not believe in heaven!

429
00:52:04,554 --> 00:52:09,617
You're alive, you're alive! Already
I have two, not one. Two.

430
00:52:10,927 --> 00:52:13,794
- Hell, I see that you found.
- Ella me.

431
00:52:13,830 --> 00:52:15,627
We gotta go, we gotta go.

432
00:52:15,665 --> 00:52:17,758
- What happens?
- Rico!

433
00:52:17,834 --> 00:52:21,668
- My God, George.
- It is a very strong name. You can help us.

434
00:52:21,738 --> 00:52:23,330
Do you?

435
00:52:23,373 --> 00:52:24,840
Come on, we gotta go.

436
00:52:26,576 --> 00:52:29,136
You see that in your face?

437
00:52:30,080 --> 00:52:32,446
Is it contagious?

438
00:52:55,205 --> 00:52:57,969
How do we expect Loquita?

439
00:52:58,975 --> 00:53:02,411
- Only two?
- There was more. Some were lost ...

440
00:53:02,445 --> 00:53:05,380
and I followed.
I did the best I could y. ..

441
00:53:05,415 --> 00:53:07,906
You did good. Did
Well, Sissy. You did good.

442
00:53:07,951 --> 00:53:11,717
- But they are only two.
- We are double.

443
00:53:12,856 --> 00:53:17,054
You are very brave. Let me see.

444
00:53:22,532 --> 00:53:24,432
Come on.

445
00:53:41,051 --> 00:53:42,814
I'm George, it's Pete.

446
00:53:42,852 --> 00:53:47,346
- Chaquefer.
- Are there others?

447
00:53:49,292 --> 00:53:52,659
Were. We are only Sissy and me.

448
00:53:53,663 --> 00:53:55,255
Walkers ?

449
00:53:58,268 --> 00:54:02,602
They must be thirsty. The process of
filtrate left a bad taste in the mouth.

450
00:54:02,639 --> 00:54:04,800
If neither of jokes.

451
00:54:05,642 --> 00:54:10,102
- Want something stronger?
- Yes, lightning, yeah!

452
00:54:14,751 --> 00:54:16,651
Filtering Process?

453
00:54:17,921 --> 00:54:24,156
Following the initial invasion of microbes
in the blood are lethal to them.

454
00:54:24,227 --> 00:54:29,130
But the blood is crucial for
survival. The answer is ...

455
00:54:29,165 --> 00:54:34,728
mix the blood. Experience
which is the best way to do it.

456
00:54:46,750 --> 00:54:49,651
Those caught in the gaps
and store the blood until ...

457
00:54:49,686 --> 00:54:51,881
refine the process.

458
00:54:51,955 --> 00:54:58,053
Others are alive
and experiment with them.

459
00:55:00,330 --> 00:55:04,164
- Others?
- Children.

460
00:55:04,200 --> 00:55:06,100
Do children?

461
00:55:09,806 --> 00:55:13,435
Damn! Not bad.

462
00:55:13,510 --> 00:55:18,140
We have to get used to, is synthetic.

463
00:55:18,214 --> 00:55:21,274
- Brandy?
- More or less.

464
00:55:21,318 --> 00:55:24,515
Here the whole process.

465
00:55:24,554 --> 00:55:28,490
- Why?
- There are no resources.

466
00:55:28,525 --> 00:55:32,825
It is difficult to get things on Mars.

467
00:55:44,040 --> 00:55:46,702
Does anyone else get this show?

468
00:55:46,743 --> 00:55:51,544
Positive alpha. Something pulls me.

469
00:55:52,882 --> 00:55:55,373
Copying, Raya, I too.

470
00:55:59,155 --> 00:56:00,782
What the hell?

471
00:56:04,294 --> 00:56:07,286
Seem to us to visit.

472
00:56:17,807 --> 00:56:20,742
I do not recall that on Mars
have images of this site.

473
00:56:20,810 --> 00:56:24,803
If the disease
have they affected the head.

474
00:56:24,848 --> 00:56:28,340
Technically are still on the ship.

475
00:56:29,853 --> 00:56:34,756
The ship is on Mars. This
site is a good experiment.

476
00:56:34,824 --> 00:56:38,783
They created it to recreate
our society.

477
00:56:38,828 --> 00:56:42,195
- How does a mouse cage?
- Exactly.

478
00:56:42,232 --> 00:56:45,429
But we refuse
to run on the wheel.

479
00:56:47,137 --> 00:56:53,838
- They are crazy.
- Are not we on Earth?

480
00:56:55,178 --> 00:56:58,045
I have not been on Earth
for two years.

481
00:56:58,948 --> 00:57:00,415
Two years?

482
00:57:00,483 --> 00:57:03,179
We caught the first invasion.

483
00:57:03,219 --> 00:57:05,744
Soon there were others. I ...

484
00:57:05,789 --> 00:57:08,383
I escaped.

485
00:57:09,826 --> 00:57:13,922
Sissy was the first children.

486
00:57:19,135 --> 00:57:21,603
Do you see what I see?

487
00:57:27,343 --> 00:57:30,073
Do nothing.

488
00:57:30,113 --> 00:57:33,913
Something tells me that only
will have a chance.

489
00:57:34,918 --> 00:57:36,647
When you tell, sir.

490
00:57:46,329 --> 00:57:49,162
- Kill the pain.
- It kills your brain cells.

491
00:57:49,232 --> 00:57:52,759
I understand that it is difficult to assimilate.

492
00:57:52,836 --> 00:57:56,203
Sissy can show you.

493
00:57:56,239 --> 00:57:59,333
No, I do not want to return.

494
00:58:02,011 --> 00:58:04,002
Many bad memories.

495
00:58:38,248 --> 00:58:39,738
George.

496
00:58:39,816 --> 00:58:42,876
Do not believe in that crazy, right?

497
00:58:42,919 --> 00:58:46,514
I have to find out.

498
00:58:52,529 --> 00:58:54,656
This is crazy.

499
00:58:56,266 --> 00:58:59,429
- What else can I do?
- This is as real as I am.

500
00:58:59,469 --> 00:59:02,370
A half recreated? Jaula
mice? Why favor!

501
00:59:03,373 --> 00:59:08,470
Alli. It is the emergency exit.
Nobody ever uses it. Take care.

502
00:59:14,584 --> 00:59:17,382
Go on, boss. I protect you.

503
01:00:33,363 --> 01:00:39,268
Here on Earth to the Mayor
Cramer. Please respond.

504
01:00:47,877 --> 01:00:49,868
We really have nobody in the fleet.

505
01:00:49,912 --> 01:00:52,745
Neither army.

506
01:00:52,782 --> 01:00:55,342
Or militia.

507
01:00:55,385 --> 01:00:57,683
Asi es.

508
01:01:04,027 --> 01:01:06,222
Want emborracharte?

509
01:01:16,372 --> 01:01:23,073
Okay, guys. Resist entering
in the Martian atmosphere.

510
01:01:56,779 --> 01:01:59,748
Alfa here. Do all went?

511
01:01:59,782 --> 01:02:03,718
- Affirmative, Sweet here.
- Copy all here.

512
01:02:05,521 --> 01:02:08,149
- Ok, guys.
- Going back to training.

513
01:02:18,968 --> 01:02:20,936
Now.

514
01:02:29,545 --> 01:02:33,072
Holy Mother of Christ.

515
01:02:33,149 --> 01:02:36,050
Sweet, on the left.

516
01:02:37,186 --> 01:02:40,553
Attempts to reach the ship. No
Check out this battle.

517
01:02:40,590 --> 01:02:45,823
We use the missiles. Sidewall
left. Enter count of three.

518
01:02:45,862 --> 01:02:47,386
Copying, Alfa.

519
01:03:08,851 --> 01:03:11,342
Crap.

520
01:03:17,126 --> 01:03:20,220
Go ahead, advanced. I will.

521
01:03:29,539 --> 01:03:31,029
Concentrate.

522
01:03:36,946 --> 01:03:39,471
I'm close.

523
01:03:42,051 --> 01:03:47,387
Calm, all me.

524
01:03:54,564 --> 01:03:56,794
Seven. Six.

525
01:04:12,315 --> 01:04:17,150
Well, gather the resources
we can and get back to the ship.

526
01:04:17,220 --> 01:04:21,554
Hear what he said, kept alive
to children, Alex should be there.

527
01:04:21,624 --> 01:04:25,924
- It's a suicide.
- Relax, Don liquor.

528
01:04:28,631 --> 01:04:33,261
There are miles of tunnels. We caught
before you get close.

529
01:04:35,238 --> 01:04:41,143
- I take them, but ...
- What's wrong?

530
01:04:45,481 --> 01:04:51,386
During the time they experienced
with Sissy, was a superstar.

531
01:04:51,454 --> 01:04:55,356
He did everything and survived.

532
01:04:57,293 --> 01:05:01,229
Mixtures of several viruses
created a kind of supergripe.

533
01:05:02,798 --> 01:05:07,565
- How not to kill her?
- The killing, but more slowly.

534
01:05:07,603 --> 01:05:11,539
- She hit the?
- Not exactly, I ...

535
01:05:12,942 --> 01:05:15,410
Attacks before they
could distribute them.

536
01:05:15,444 --> 01:05:20,245
- I got infected, but too late.
- So Sissy returned to the ship.

537
01:05:22,051 --> 01:05:24,451
That is why we are here now.

538
01:05:27,223 --> 01:05:28,349
I do not understand.

539
01:05:29,625 --> 01:05:31,923
You are part of the resistance.

540
01:05:33,429 --> 01:05:38,162
Resistance ? You, me,
this half-dead and the insane?

541
01:05:40,937 --> 01:05:48,070
- Just for me to recover my son.
- Your son is only a part of everything.

542
01:05:50,079 --> 01:05:56,712
The question is ... How far
where you're ready to go?

543
01:05:56,752 --> 01:05:58,743
To save it.

544
01:06:09,899 --> 01:06:13,096
- What do you think that?
- The Martian Armageddon.

545
01:06:14,904 --> 01:06:17,805
With this in your system,
when you take the ship ...

546
01:06:17,840 --> 01:06:22,743
Your blood will contaminate the rest. If all
the blood is contaminated, will not survive.

547
01:06:24,313 --> 01:06:30,809
That will kill the ship. In the long run will
the center of the system, I do not know where he is.

548
01:06:30,853 --> 01:06:36,814
- Sorry, but no thanks.
- I know where your son, George. I know.

549
01:06:41,764 --> 01:06:44,927
You can release it. Back to embrace.

550
01:06:46,268 --> 01:06:52,468
It is a round trip. If you accept,
Sissy will show you where you are.

551
01:06:55,444 --> 01:06:58,379
There must be another way.
This guy is dying.

552
01:06:58,447 --> 01:07:00,415
Do not do this.

553
01:07:16,599 --> 01:07:19,067
Tell me where is my son.

554
01:07:19,101 --> 01:07:21,535
Tell me where you are!

555
01:07:21,604 --> 01:07:23,799
God.

556
01:07:27,309 --> 01:07:29,004
No.

557
01:07:46,028 --> 01:07:48,053
You okay?

558
01:07:49,165 --> 01:07:50,928
We can resolve this.

559
01:07:50,966 --> 01:07:52,831
Stay with me.

560
01:07:52,868 --> 01:07:58,773
I knew where my son.
Knew he was alive.

561
01:07:58,841 --> 01:08:00,536
And what we find.

562
01:08:00,576 --> 01:08:02,976
I find it.

563
01:08:12,088 --> 01:08:14,886
Is that part of Mars?

564
01:08:21,530 --> 01:08:23,930
Look for Alex!

565
01:08:44,620 --> 01:08:47,180
The planes we can
take home, George.

566
01:08:47,223 --> 01:08:49,418
If we find them.

567
01:08:49,458 --> 01:08:54,259
Find a door.
To find my son.

568
01:08:54,330 --> 01:08:58,664
That girl know. We
to find the nuts.

569
01:08:58,734 --> 01:09:04,036
- I went.
- How do you know? Find it.

570
01:09:07,977 --> 01:09:10,673
I tell you crazy you can help.

571
01:09:21,524 --> 01:09:25,517
George, we must
out of here. Now!

572
01:09:27,196 --> 01:09:29,096
That is my one way.

573
01:09:30,332 --> 01:09:31,924
No, no!

574
01:12:09,925 --> 01:12:12,359
Oh God!

575
01:12:15,164 --> 01:12:18,224
You okay? You're
Live! Breathe, breathe.

576
01:12:29,611 --> 01:12:31,909
Does the music of Twinkle,
bright star?

577
01:12:31,947 --> 01:12:34,347
It's Alex.

578
01:12:46,795 --> 01:12:49,559
Take care. Do not touch the wall.

579
01:13:00,642 --> 01:13:02,735
Here.

580
01:13:07,216 --> 01:13:08,615
Over here.

581
01:13:33,041 --> 01:13:34,133
Come on.

582
01:13:35,077 --> 01:13:37,068
I do not want him.

583
01:13:41,250 --> 01:13:43,582
We gotta go now, George. Come on!

584
01:13:43,652 --> 01:13:47,554
Come on, come on.

585
01:13:50,592 --> 01:13:53,083
A second, follow me.

586
01:14:02,237 --> 01:14:05,297
Rays. What the hell is that thing?

587
01:14:07,242 --> 01:14:11,110
It is the brain, Pete.
It's like being reported.

588
01:14:11,146 --> 01:14:13,205
We gotta go.

589
01:14:14,616 --> 01:14:18,017
Wait, this will help me.

590
01:14:19,221 --> 01:14:22,520
- What do you do with that?
- We must give him a dose.

591
01:14:22,558 --> 01:14:25,584
- I do not use needles, partner.
- Get me out blood.

592
01:14:25,627 --> 01:14:28,118
- What are you doing, Dad?
- Wow!

593
01:14:28,163 --> 01:14:30,324
Quiet.

594
01:14:32,534 --> 01:14:35,731
I do not like this, no
I like needles.

595
01:14:38,440 --> 01:14:41,967
- Quiet, quiet.
- You okay, Dad?

596
01:14:45,147 --> 01:14:46,944
This sucks.

597
01:14:51,153 --> 01:14:55,112
- Dad!
- Do you hear that? We gotta go now.

598
01:14:55,157 --> 01:14:56,522
Now!

599
01:14:56,558 --> 01:14:58,185
Stay close, Alex.
Do not touch the walls.

600
01:15:44,540 --> 01:15:46,633
Come on, jump. Come on!

601
01:15:52,347 --> 01:15:54,645
Reverse the motor
principal to go from here.

602
01:15:54,683 --> 01:15:57,379
- If anyone can, you can.
- Hopefully.

603
01:15:57,452 --> 01:15:59,044
Over here.

604
01:16:28,550 --> 01:16:31,849
- IMayor!
- Alex? What are you doing here?

605
01:16:33,722 --> 01:16:36,623
Arrive in good time
we go from here.

606
01:16:36,658 --> 01:16:39,786
- Be somebody?
- There is a lot.

607
01:16:39,828 --> 01:16:43,730
Prepare to meet the ships and all
those who can. We're going now.

608
01:16:43,765 --> 01:16:45,426
Come on, guys!

609
01:16:46,535 --> 01:16:48,935
We gotta get out of here.

610
01:16:53,775 --> 01:16:55,640
The ship fell.

611
01:17:00,882 --> 01:17:03,112
Sit down here, buddy.

612
01:17:07,089 --> 01:17:08,579
I got something for you.

613
01:17:08,624 --> 01:17:11,525
Put this on. I will
your instructions.

614
01:17:13,996 --> 01:17:14,985
Resist, George.

615
01:17:16,732 --> 01:17:18,996
Do not worry, your father will be fine.

616
01:17:22,204 --> 01:17:24,001
George, resist, mate.

617
01:17:25,007 --> 01:17:26,406
Resist, Dad.

618
01:17:27,709 --> 01:17:29,700
Get us out of here, Alex.

619
01:17:40,255 --> 01:17:42,348
We need to locate the
vortex hopping in time.

620
01:17:45,861 --> 01:17:47,658
I think I have something.

621
01:17:49,431 --> 01:17:52,366
Victoria, we need
the coordinates of the jump.

622
01:17:52,434 --> 01:17:55,801
- Victoria, go ahead.
- There they are.

623
01:17:55,837 --> 01:17:58,135
You hear me?

624
01:17:58,173 --> 01:18:00,198
Need the coordinates for the jump.

625
01:18:00,275 --> 01:18:02,175
There are there.

626
01:18:06,515 --> 01:18:10,451
C300. And negative 43.

627
01:18:10,485 --> 01:18:13,784
X 59. 65 degrees.

628
01:18:19,027 --> 01:18:23,293
We have! We have,
boys. See you at home.

629
01:18:26,935 --> 01:18:30,302
Hold on everybody, let's jump.

630
01:18:47,856 --> 01:18:50,791
THREE MONTHS AFTER

631
01:18:50,826 --> 01:18:55,456
- Where did you learn to cook well?
- Some of the benefits of the prison.

632
01:18:56,965 --> 01:19:00,128
- Disciplinary action?
- That I am afraid, sir.

633
01:19:00,168 --> 01:19:04,195
It was good for
us today. Excellent.

634
01:19:04,272 --> 01:19:05,796
Thank you.

635
01:19:08,810 --> 01:19:10,607
Did you finish, Alex?

636
01:19:19,387 --> 01:19:21,981
Can I get up?

637
01:19:22,991 --> 01:19:24,891
Clear.

638
01:19:29,131 --> 01:19:33,158
All this has been difficult
for him. It's just a child.

639
01:19:33,201 --> 01:19:35,032
If.

640
01:19:49,117 --> 01:19:50,516
How you doing, buddy?

641
01:19:50,552 --> 01:19:52,213
Well.

642
01:19:52,254 --> 01:19:54,722
I know I have a lot to think about.

643
01:19:54,756 --> 01:19:58,453
I just want you to know that
we are all friends.

644
01:19:58,527 --> 01:20:02,327
- If you want to talk about something, say so.
- Okay.

645
01:20:02,364 --> 01:20:06,926
This world is a place where kids
as we have to mature quickly.

646
01:20:06,968 --> 01:20:10,836
I am very proud of
as things got, Alex.

647
01:20:10,872 --> 01:20:17,277
- I miss my dad.
- Me too.

648
01:20:18,880 --> 01:20:21,348
¡Man!

649
01:20:21,383 --> 01:20:23,613
Damn.

650
01:20:23,652 --> 01:20:25,779
Dad, come!

651
01:20:28,156 --> 01:20:30,454
God, gentle champion.

652
01:20:30,492 --> 01:20:34,053
- Is still fragile, Alex.
- I take care.

653
01:20:34,095 --> 01:20:35,960
I count on that, son.

654
01:20:37,365 --> 01:20:40,459
- Mayor.
- George. I am very happy to see you.

655
01:20:40,502 --> 01:20:41,901
Pete!

656
01:20:45,674 --> 01:20:49,201
- Welcome.
- Nice to see you, Vicky.

657
01:20:55,784 --> 01:20:57,843
Tremendo clock, man.

658
01:20:57,886 --> 01:21:00,719
- I gave it to my dad.
- Really?

659
01:21:02,824 --> 01:21:03,813
Come on.

660
01:21:04,626 --> 01:21:07,959
- It seems that they are eating well!
- Yes. Eat something.

661
01:21:10,465 --> 01:21:13,525
- Glad to see you.
- Likewise.

662
01:21:13,568 --> 01:21:19,234
- How is he?
- It was serious, but the infection happened.

663
01:21:19,274 --> 01:21:20,832
Well.

664
01:21:22,344 --> 01:21:24,642
I think we have returned
is the best medicine.

665
01:21:42,764 --> 01:21:44,994
Beware!
