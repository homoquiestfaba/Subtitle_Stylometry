Thad, I said no toys

But it's Christmas.

00:01:00,247 --> 00:01:01,461
Stop it!

00:01:01,566 --> 00:01:03,495
- Hey! Dad!
- Hey!

9
00:01:03,982 --> 00:01:07,252
Thad, you can't go crying
to other people all the time.

10
00:01:07,286 --> 00:01:11,151
A man needs to know when
to stand up for himself.

Dear Magic-isn't-real Ball,

Ouch.

14
00:01:21,538 --> 00:01:23,555
Outlook not so good.

15
00:01:35,539 --> 00:01:37,095

19
00:01:49,522 --> 00:01:50,546
Help!

20
00:02:19,106 --> 00:02:20,130
Hello?

21
00:03:12,979 --> 00:03:15,240
Thaddeus Sivana.

22
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:17,489
Who are you?

23
00:03:18,497 --> 00:03:19,782
How do you know my name?

24
00:03:19,834 --> 00:03:22,969
I am the last of the
consul of wizards.

25
00:03:24,228 --> 00:03:28,402
Sworn to protect realms
from the Seven Deadly Sins.

26
00:03:32,110 --> 00:03:34,086
For years have passed

27
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:36,815
and I have grown weak.

28
00:03:37,177 --> 00:03:41,479
That is why I seek a
champion to inherit my magic.

29
00:03:41,889 --> 00:03:44,580
You want me
to do magic?

30
00:03:44,786 --> 00:03:46,167
With this,

31
00:03:47,022 --> 00:03:50,062
all of my powers
will become yours.

32
00:03:56,186 --> 00:03:57,663
But first,

33
00:03:58,607 --> 00:04:01,480
you must demonstrate that
you're pure of heart

34
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:03,468
and strong in spirit.

35
00:04:06,571 --> 00:04:08,745
He lies.

36
00:04:09,596 --> 00:04:13,081
Don't be his champion.

37
00:04:13,744 --> 00:04:17,070
We can give you power.

38
00:04:17,581 --> 00:04:20,057
Search the eye.

39
00:04:26,742 --> 00:04:30,123
Your father thinks you're weak.

40
00:04:30,377 --> 00:04:33,345
Show him your power.

41
00:04:43,663 --> 00:04:44,766
No!

42
00:04:47,317 --> 00:04:49,317
What happened?

43
00:04:49,409 --> 00:04:54,202
Only the purest of hearts
can resist their temptations.

44
00:04:54,819 --> 00:04:57,858

you will never be worthy.

You laugh,

157

who want you,

who arguably does not.

160
00:13:40,064 --> 00:13:41,477
It's time someone
looked you in the eye

161
00:13:41,502 --> 00:13:43,057
and told it to you straight.

162
00:13:43,152 --> 00:13:46,112

173
00:14:14,314 --> 00:14:15,774

184
00:14:45,913 --> 00:14:47,286
Ooh, back in the dark ages.

185

186
00:14:48,573 --> 00:14:49,849

187
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:51,444
Got my finger on the pulse.

188
00:14:51,523 --> 00:14:54,483
Yeah, that's a reference to his
blood pressure because he's old.

189
00:14:54,584 --> 00:14:55,997
Billy, do you have
any food allergies?

190
00:14:56,045 --> 00:14:57,844
Oh, wish you did.
Darla's cookin'.

191
00:14:57,886 --> 00:14:59,311
- Oy, guerito!
- What?

192
00:15:01,723 --> 00:15:03,795
We know how overwhelming
it can all be.

193
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:05,382
New house, new faces.

194
00:15:05,432 --> 00:15:07,027
All up in your face.

195
00:15:07,158 --> 00:15:09,555
Just...
take it at your own speed.

196
00:15:19,698 --> 00:15:20,889
Hello?

197
00:15:25,239 --> 00:15:26,437
We're home!

198
00:15:26,477 --> 00:15:28,564
That's what happens
when you suck!

199
00:15:29,870 --> 00:15:31,592
So much for the welcome party.

200
00:15:31,754 --> 00:15:34,754
Yeah, that thing growing out
of the couch would be Eugene.

201
00:15:35,288 --> 00:15:36,558
Is that him?

202
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:38,250
Oh, my gosh! Billy!

203
00:15:38,322 --> 00:15:39,743
Whoa, slow down, slow down!

204
00:15:39,896 --> 00:15:41,079
Welcome home!

205
00:15:41,118 --> 00:15:42,992
- And that's Darla.
- I'm Darla.

206
00:15:43,017 --> 00:15:44,031
Big hugger.

207
00:15:44,056 --> 00:15:45,069
I noticed.

208
00:15:45,370 --> 00:15:47,290
Die! Die! Die!

209
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:49,682
He doesn't mean that.
It's the game.

210
00:15:51,998 --> 00:15:53,130
Hey.

211
00:15:53,162 --> 00:15:55,029
No sodas after dark, remember?

212
00:15:55,428 --> 00:15:57,603
Whoa. When did it get dark?

213
00:15:57,661 --> 00:16:00,201
Oh, the poster. I made you one.
Come look!

214
00:16:00,624 --> 00:16:02,847
Oh, no!

215
00:16:02,977 --> 00:16:05,329
Sorry, Pedro must've been
working out.

216
00:16:05,535 --> 00:16:07,635
He was supposed
to be at school.

217
00:16:09,091 --> 00:16:10,146
Oh.

218
00:16:10,404 --> 00:16:11,435
Here.

219
00:16:12,738 --> 00:16:13,738
Yes.

220
00:16:13,763 --> 00:16:17,048
Exactly why your Math Department
is so uniquely suited for me.

221
00:16:18,025 --> 00:16:20,041
I can't, I can't even...
with Eugene right now.

222
00:16:20,208 --> 00:16:21,795
Sorry. Mary. Hi.

223
00:16:21,882 --> 00:16:23,025
College interview.

224
00:16:23,068 --> 00:16:25,394
- I'm Billy.
- What am I most excited about?

225
00:16:25,610 --> 00:16:26,618
Oh.

226
00:16:26,690 --> 00:16:29,571
What a great question.
I was hoping you'd ask.

227
00:16:31,783 --> 00:16:34,442
Mention you're a foster kid.
Colleges eat that up.

228
00:16:34,963 --> 00:16:36,820
What I'm most excited about

229
00:16:36,845 --> 00:16:38,298
is the campus experience.

230
00:16:38,323 --> 00:16:40,219
As a foster child,
I'm a big believer

231
00:16:40,244 --> 00:16:42,472
in finding family and
friends in the most

232
00:16:42,497 --> 00:16:44,118
unlikely of places.

233
00:16:47,062 --> 00:16:49,101
Oh, I'm gonna miss
that girl so much!

234
00:16:49,183 --> 00:16:50,968
It's Caltech,
it's a very prestigious school.

235
00:16:51,145 --> 00:16:52,977
And also all the way
in California.

236
00:16:53,021 --> 00:16:55,219
But we don't have to talk
about that right now.

237
00:16:55,283 --> 00:16:56,934
It's a tough subject for me.

238
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,222
Do you like vegan food?

239
00:16:58,269 --> 00:17:00,119
- Mm-mm.
- 'Cause, see, I love animals.

240
00:17:02,436 --> 00:17:03,840
Oh, no! The tofurkey!

241
00:17:03,872 --> 00:17:05,832
Oh, no, we may have
to eat a real turkey!

242
00:17:05,864 --> 00:17:08,569
- Is that?
- It's okay. Come, I'll show you your room.

243
00:17:08,941 --> 00:17:11,560
It's a bit of a madhouse,
I know, but,

244
00:17:11,624 --> 00:17:12,877
it's fun!

245
00:17:14,968 --> 00:17:16,031
Watch the bumps there.

246
00:17:16,087 --> 00:17:18,468
Pedro, mi amor, hola.

247
00:17:18,516 --> 00:17:19,646
Say hi to Billy.

248
00:17:21,402 --> 00:17:23,982
Don't take it personally.
He's like that with everyone.

249
00:17:28,007 --> 00:17:29,118
Freddy.

250
00:17:30,245 --> 00:17:31,753
This is Billy Batson.

251
00:17:32,518 --> 00:17:34,574
Make sure you make him
feel at home, okay?

252
00:17:34,934 --> 00:17:36,529
Maybe don't say anything
too weird?

253
00:17:36,656 --> 00:17:37,799
Oh, one weird thing is

254
00:17:37,824 --> 00:17:40,418
you know the Romans used to
brush their teeth with their urine?

255
00:17:42,322 --> 00:17:44,029
Apparently, it-it works.

256
00:17:44,603 --> 00:17:46,031
Yup, um...

257
00:17:55,008 --> 00:17:57,142
Oh, it's, uh...
it's a long way down.

258
00:17:57,381 --> 00:18:00,031
Trust me, I speak from experience.

259
00:18:03,373 --> 00:18:05,079
Victor pushed me.

260
00:18:05,611 --> 00:18:08,182
They seem nice,
but don't buy it.

261
00:18:09,094 --> 00:18:11,427
It gets real Game of Thrones
around here.

262
00:18:12,956 --> 00:18:14,019
What?

263
00:18:15,084 --> 00:18:17,735
Dude, I'm... just messin' around.

264
00:18:17,893 --> 00:18:20,378
It's um, it's terminal cancer, I...

265
00:18:20,580 --> 00:18:22,303
I have three months.

266
00:18:23,551 --> 00:18:24,923
Kidding, again!

267
00:18:24,948 --> 00:18:26,470
You look at me and you're, like,
"Why so dark?"

268
00:18:26,495 --> 00:18:28,947
"You're a disabled foster kid,
you've got it all." Right?

269
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:33,607
Oh, yeah, that's the, uh,
the old batarang.

270
00:18:33,833 --> 00:18:35,420
I mean, it's a replica, but...

271
00:18:35,611 --> 00:18:36,912
Feel how sharp.

272
00:18:37,214 --> 00:18:39,033
Could kill you in your sleep
with that thing.

273
00:18:40,058 --> 00:18:41,630
You ever a Supes guy?

274
00:18:42,121 --> 00:18:43,332
Yeah, me too.

275
00:18:43,721 --> 00:18:45,998
Behold, the holy grail.

276
00:18:46,146 --> 00:18:48,638
One nine millimeter round
shot at Superman himself.

277
00:18:48,741 --> 00:18:49,829
It's legit.

278
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:52,595
Probably worth, I dunno,
$5-600, maybe more.

279
00:18:53,318 --> 00:18:54,374
What's in the bag?

280
00:18:54,691 --> 00:18:55,691
Hey.

281
00:18:55,716 --> 00:18:58,010
Hey, it's all good.
It's good to maintain boundaries.

282
00:18:59,669 --> 00:19:01,366
You don't gotta
talk so much, you know.

283
00:19:02,945 --> 00:19:05,421
I mean, this place is great.
You're gonna love it.

284
00:19:29,785 --> 00:19:30,944
Dinner!

285
00:19:38,177 --> 00:19:39,907
All hands on deck!

286
00:19:42,092 --> 00:19:43,267
Sweet.

287
00:19:43,449 --> 00:19:44,933
Thank you for this family.

288
00:19:44,983 --> 00:19:46,555
Thank you for this day.

289
00:19:46,714 --> 00:19:48,293
Thank you for this food.

290
00:19:48,353 --> 00:19:50,155
Even if it's not steak fillet.

291
00:19:53,673 --> 00:19:56,284
Big school. 2,000 students,
you might think,

292
00:19:56,330 --> 00:19:57,904
"Wow, so many strangers."

293
00:19:57,929 --> 00:19:59,541
But not if you think of them as

294
00:19:59,582 --> 00:20:01,097
possible for each friend then,

295
00:20:01,147 --> 00:20:02,635
"Oh, so many friends."

296
00:20:03,085 --> 00:20:05,934
The principal, her name's
Shirley. She's the best.

297
00:20:06,293 --> 00:20:07,293
Next.

298
00:20:08,241 --> 00:20:09,971
This is our security scanner.

299
00:20:09,996 --> 00:20:12,138
Like in an airport.
It's totally safe.

300
00:20:12,219 --> 00:20:13,814
I know what it is.

301
00:20:14,285 --> 00:20:15,650
Does she always do this?

302
00:20:16,353 --> 00:20:18,662
Silence makes me uncomfortable.

303
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:21,071
She's almost never uncomfortable.

304
00:20:23,644 --> 00:20:25,279
Have a good first day,
big brother.

305
00:20:25,334 --> 00:20:27,287
Look, you don't have
to hug me all the time.

306
00:20:27,398 --> 00:20:29,732
We're not actually
brother and sister, so.

307
00:20:31,497 --> 00:20:32,838
I'm sorry.

308
00:20:36,238 --> 00:20:38,357
- Hey.
- Hey.

309
00:20:38,435 --> 00:20:40,262
I-I didn't mean to make her...

310
00:20:43,002 --> 00:20:45,621
<i>I was overwhelmed, honestly.</i>

311
00:20:47,333 --> 00:20:50,230
<i>He said I must be pure of heart.</i>

312
00:20:50,406 --> 00:20:53,089
<i>He called himself a wizard.</i>

313
00:20:53,173 --> 00:20:54,824
<i>Just like a...</i>

314
00:20:54,903 --> 00:20:57,618
<i>a wizard from Harry Potter, some...</i>

315
00:20:58,766 --> 00:21:01,743
<i>But y-you're saying that other
people have experienced this?</i>

316
00:21:01,794 --> 00:21:03,278
In a sense, yes.

317
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:06,024
Do you remember
what he said to you?

318
00:21:06,294 --> 00:21:08,238
<i>He tested me.</i>

319
00:21:08,941 --> 00:21:11,536
<i>There were these statues.</i>

320
00:21:11,691 --> 00:21:13,698
<i>Their eyes, it's like
they were looking at me,</i>

321
00:21:13,738 --> 00:21:15,527
<i>making me think things.</i>

322
00:21:15,726 --> 00:21:17,187
<i>Like, horrible things.</i>

323
00:21:17,515 --> 00:21:19,959
And do these approximate
what you saw?

324
00:21:21,406 --> 00:21:24,621
<i>Yes. That's exactly
how I remember it.</i>

325
00:21:24,904 --> 00:21:27,005
<i>I-I don't understand.
How do you know...?</i>

326
00:21:27,047 --> 00:21:29,008
Recurring imagery has
proven very common

327
00:21:29,033 --> 00:21:31,005
 in cases of mass hysteria.

328
00:21:31,211 --> 00:21:32,481
<i>"Mass hysteria"?</i>

329
00:21:32,506 --> 00:21:33,591
I know.

330
00:21:33,616 --> 00:21:35,434
The term's a bit theatrical.

331
00:21:35,459 --> 00:21:37,818
But take UFO sightings,
for example.

332
00:21:38,021 --> 00:21:40,291
Lights in the sky,
flying saucers.

333
00:21:40,450 --> 00:21:43,704
Isolated incidents of people
who do not know each other...

334
00:21:43,791 --> 00:21:45,018
Symbols.

335
00:21:48,970 --> 00:21:50,532
Ask her about the symbols.

336
00:21:51,582 --> 00:21:53,288
Sorry, Ms. Kwan.

337
00:21:53,439 --> 00:21:56,082
But as an example of
recurring imagery,

338
00:21:56,247 --> 00:21:58,095
maybe you recall seeing

339
00:21:58,120 --> 00:22:00,858
these symbols before
the alleged abduction?

340
00:22:01,657 --> 00:22:04,078
<i>Don't remember any symbols, no.</i>

341
00:22:04,390 --> 00:22:08,104
<i>I think I caught it on video.
There was something, um...</i>

342
00:22:08,194 --> 00:22:10,796
<i>I remember the numbers on
my alarm clock, they kept</i>

343
00:22:10,821 --> 00:22:11,972
<i>shifting.</i>

344
00:22:12,038 --> 00:22:13,078
Video?

345
00:22:15,086 --> 00:22:16,522
Show me the video.

346
00:22:16,768 --> 00:22:19,427
Uh, Ms. Kwan,
this is Dr. Sivana.

347
00:22:19,622 --> 00:22:22,503
<i>Um, one moment,
I can send it.</i>

348
00:22:23,783 --> 00:22:24,767
<i>Hello?</i>

349
00:22:25,479 --> 00:22:27,629
<i>Oh, my God!
Who's there?</i>

350
00:22:28,515 --> 00:22:29,546
<i>Hello?</i>

351
00:22:29,571 --> 00:22:31,603
<i>What's going on?
What's happening?</i>

352
00:22:33,172 --> 00:22:35,291
<i>I'm-I'm going
to call the police.</i>

353
00:22:36,682 --> 00:22:39,285
<i>Then this blinding light
all around me.</i>

354
00:22:39,444 --> 00:22:42,269
<i>And I felt like I was
getting pulled down...</i>

355
00:22:42,353 --> 00:22:45,259
<i>Like a temple
carved inside a mountain...</i>

356
00:22:45,336 --> 00:22:48,235
<i>Exactly what you'd expect from
a guy who call himself a wizard.</i>

357
00:22:48,283 --> 00:22:50,569
<i>...brought there
to save the world.</i>

358
00:22:53,122 --> 00:22:54,511
Dr. Sivana!

359
00:22:55,077 --> 00:22:57,735
I appreciate your enthusiasm.

360
00:22:57,896 --> 00:23:00,221
But you're funding my project.

361
00:23:00,246 --> 00:23:03,240
And when I'm interviewing,
I don't wanna be interrupted.

362
00:23:03,354 --> 00:23:05,529
56 reported abductions.

363
00:23:05,554 --> 00:23:07,412
- I never saw it.
- Saw what?

364
00:23:23,198 --> 00:23:24,904
Doctor, what is all this?

365
00:23:25,426 --> 00:23:27,489
All these years...

366
00:23:29,381 --> 00:23:30,996
I was convinced

367
00:23:31,056 --> 00:23:33,671
I had the incorrect sequence.

368
00:23:33,727 --> 00:23:35,314
Or perhaps...

369
00:23:35,473 --> 00:23:38,989
the wrong symbols
to open the door.

370
00:23:40,202 --> 00:23:42,622
But on that woman's alarm clock,

371
00:23:43,570 --> 00:23:45,372
the seven symbols.

372
00:23:46,121 --> 00:23:47,899
The sequence

373
00:23:48,335 --> 00:23:50,002
repeating itself

374
00:23:50,534 --> 00:23:52,280
seven times.

375
00:23:53,825 --> 00:23:55,325
That's the difference.

376
00:23:55,375 --> 00:23:57,176
Is this some sort of joke?

377
00:23:57,256 --> 00:23:59,073
It may seem that way to you.

378
00:23:59,386 --> 00:24:01,680
Because we're not, in actuality,

379
00:24:01,706 --> 00:24:03,634
studying mass hysteria.

380
00:24:03,674 --> 00:24:05,785
What all these people have seen,

381
00:24:06,425 --> 00:24:08,457
every single one of them,

382
00:24:08,482 --> 00:24:10,259
is absolutely real.

383
00:24:11,074 --> 00:24:13,295
An alarm clock malfunctions,

384
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:16,368
and your first thought is
it's proof of a wizard?

385
00:24:16,738 --> 00:24:18,627
Come on, Dr. Sivana.

386
00:24:18,658 --> 00:24:21,126
You can't believe
any of this is real.

387
00:24:34,078 --> 00:24:35,482
Why, yes.

388
00:24:41,423 --> 00:24:42,621
Yes, I do.

389
00:25:21,392 --> 00:25:23,998
I've been waiting
for this moment

390
00:25:24,094 --> 00:25:25,403
for so long.

391
00:25:27,276 --> 00:25:28,713
And now, here we are.

392
00:25:29,539 --> 00:25:31,229
You don't remember me, do you?

393
00:25:38,024 --> 00:25:39,984
I remember you.

394
00:25:41,383 --> 00:25:42,947
You were a boy.

395
00:25:43,106 --> 00:25:45,193
Now, you dare intrude
in my kingdom.

396
00:25:45,218 --> 00:25:47,160
Do you know what it's like
for a child to be told,

397
00:25:47,185 --> 00:25:49,058
"You'll never be good enough"?

398
00:25:49,137 --> 00:25:50,463
No, you don't.

399
00:25:51,087 --> 00:25:53,436
What you said to me
all those years ago

400
00:25:53,543 --> 00:25:55,972
made me realize
who I really was.

401
00:25:56,076 --> 00:25:57,767
And you know something?

402
00:26:00,232 --> 00:26:02,073
I am not pure of heart.

403
00:26:02,597 --> 00:26:07,430
The wizard is too weak
to stop us.

404
00:26:09,917 --> 00:26:10,980
No.

405
00:26:11,313 --> 00:26:12,369
No!

406
00:26:21,331 --> 00:26:24,609
You never found your champion.

407
00:26:25,425 --> 00:26:28,766
But we found ours.

408
00:26:43,441 --> 00:26:47,282
You are the true champion.

409
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:20,398
They're using you.

410
00:27:20,802 --> 00:27:23,064
You're nothing to them
but a means of escape.

411
00:27:29,574 --> 00:27:33,091
Through you, they'll spread the
poison to everything they touch!

412
00:27:33,704 --> 00:27:36,124
Make mankind turn into them.

413
00:27:37,147 --> 00:27:39,447
You seek a pure soul, old man.

414
00:27:39,796 --> 00:27:41,427
But no one's worthy.

415
00:27:51,828 --> 00:27:53,487
Flight or invisibility?

416
00:27:54,542 --> 00:27:56,034
If you could have
one superpower,

417
00:27:56,059 --> 00:27:57,788
flight or invisibility,
what would you pick?

418
00:27:58,131 --> 00:28:01,123
Everybody chooses flight.
You know why?

419
00:28:01,205 --> 00:28:02,935
So they can fly away
from this conversation?

420
00:28:02,979 --> 00:28:04,272
No, 'cause heroes fly.

421
00:28:04,305 --> 00:28:06,264
Who doesn't want people to
think they're a hero, right?

422
00:28:06,355 --> 00:28:09,728
But-But invisibility, no way,
I mean, that's perfect.

423
00:28:09,780 --> 00:28:11,780
Spying around on people who
don't even know you're there.

424
00:28:11,805 --> 00:28:12,946
Sneaking around everywhere.

425
00:28:12,971 --> 00:28:14,648
It's a total villain power, right?

426
00:28:21,746 --> 00:28:23,611
Then they did this study,
and this is a real thing.

427
00:28:23,644 --> 00:28:24,773
They asked people
the same question,

428
00:28:24,844 --> 00:28:26,375
You know, what power
do you want? But this time,

429
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:27,963
they made it so the
answers were anonymous.

430
00:28:28,025 --> 00:28:30,064
And-And most people, since
they knew that it was secret,

431
00:28:30,089 --> 00:28:31,255
said invisibility.

432
00:28:31,303 --> 00:28:32,476
And I think that's
'cause most people

433
00:28:32,501 --> 00:28:35,025
don't feel like heroes
on the inside, deep down.

434
00:28:35,204 --> 00:28:36,521
You're gonna run away.

435
00:28:37,461 --> 00:28:39,373
I mean, you stole my
Superman bullet.

436
00:28:39,893 --> 00:28:41,782
Dude, I get it, I get it.

437
00:28:41,893 --> 00:28:43,473
You've been screwed over
way too many times.

438
00:28:43,620 --> 00:28:44,898
You don't trust anyone.

439
00:28:45,215 --> 00:28:47,262
But that's the thing
about invisibility.

440
00:28:47,896 --> 00:28:49,504
You handle it by yourself.

441
00:28:50,845 --> 00:28:52,932
I didn't steal your dumb bullet.

442
00:28:57,972 --> 00:29:00,281
Hey, how was it today?

443
00:29:00,986 --> 00:29:02,558
That good, huh?

444
00:29:05,714 --> 00:29:06,762
Whoa!

445
00:29:08,150 --> 00:29:09,663
Oh, my God! Freddy!

446
00:29:09,743 --> 00:29:11,115
You okay?

447
00:29:13,804 --> 00:29:14,876
What the hell?

448
00:29:14,915 --> 00:29:16,567
What is wrong with you two?

449
00:29:17,085 --> 00:29:20,152
- No way that's gonna buff out.
- You gonna pay for that thing?

450
00:29:20,208 --> 00:29:21,882
For the dent you made
almost hitting me?

451
00:29:21,929 --> 00:29:25,001
Yeah, sure, um,
do you guys take these?

452
00:29:28,286 --> 00:29:29,493
Brett, stop!

453
00:29:30,993 --> 00:29:32,406
Don't touch my brother!

454
00:29:32,439 --> 00:29:34,779
What, you need your fake
family to stand up for you?

455
00:29:34,804 --> 00:29:36,466
- Stand up for yourself, man.
- Yeah, huh?

456
00:29:37,124 --> 00:29:38,890
Here, stand up.
Stand up for yourself.

457
00:29:39,076 --> 00:29:41,072
What are you gonna do?
Go home, cry to mommy?

458
00:29:41,161 --> 00:29:43,280
Oh, yeah, you don't
have a mommy.

459
00:29:44,151 --> 00:29:45,201
Stop hurting him!

460
00:29:45,228 --> 00:29:46,299
Hey!

461
00:29:49,007 --> 00:29:50,690
Man, sorry about that.

462
00:29:50,715 --> 00:29:51,848
That wasn't fair, but,

463
00:29:51,873 --> 00:29:53,613
then again,
you don't play fair, so.

464
00:29:58,370 --> 00:30:01,624
Back off, assbags, I know
how to use these things!

465
00:30:03,521 --> 00:30:04,632
Oh!

466
00:30:07,419 --> 00:30:08,490
Hey!

467
00:30:09,649 --> 00:30:11,345
Freddy, you okay?

468
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:25,166
Nowhere to run!

469
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:27,682
- Go, go, go!
- Grab him!

470
00:30:28,105 --> 00:30:29,303
Get out of the way!

471
00:30:30,534 --> 00:30:31,637
Whoa!

472
00:30:32,903 --> 00:30:34,030
No, no, no, no!

473
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:36,118
You're dead, kid!

474
00:30:36,143 --> 00:30:37,811
Yeah, you think you're funny?

475
00:30:37,890 --> 00:30:39,700
I know where you
go to school, right!

476
00:30:42,034 --> 00:30:44,684
<i>Next stop, 30th Street Station.</i>

477
00:30:44,772 --> 00:30:47,312
<i>Change for the Regional Rail Line.</i>

478
00:31:06,096 --> 00:31:07,485
Hello?

479
00:31:08,024 --> 00:31:09,326
What's going on?

480
00:31:23,762 --> 00:31:24,947
Help!

481
00:31:56,418 --> 00:31:57,727
Holy moley.

482
00:32:14,171 --> 00:32:15,243
Hello?

483
00:32:30,236 --> 00:32:31,554
What the hell?

484
00:32:31,756 --> 00:32:33,779
Who-Who's doing this?!

485
00:33:05,376 --> 00:33:07,059
Hi, um...

486
00:33:07,495 --> 00:33:10,297
I was supposed
to get off at 30th.

487
00:33:10,338 --> 00:33:11,750
Billy Batson.

488
00:33:12,286 --> 00:33:13,945
How'd you know my name?

489
00:33:13,993 --> 00:33:17,588
I am the last of the
consul of wizards.

490
00:33:18,024 --> 00:33:20,683
Keeper of the Rock of Eternity.

491
00:33:21,058 --> 00:33:22,479
Oh.

492
00:33:22,741 --> 00:33:24,608
You're

493
00:33:24,690 --> 00:33:26,044
that guy.

494
00:33:26,237 --> 00:33:27,828
Listen, I don't have any money.

495
00:33:27,935 --> 00:33:30,316
Do not patronize me, boy!

496
00:33:32,268 --> 00:33:35,950
You are standing
in the source of all magic.

497
00:33:36,139 --> 00:33:38,172
The Rock of Eternity.

498
00:33:38,251 --> 00:33:41,165
Seven foes, seven wizards.

499
00:33:41,292 --> 00:33:44,722
But long ago,
we chose a champion.

500
00:33:44,802 --> 00:33:47,085
And we chose recklessly.

501
00:33:49,710 --> 00:33:52,942
He used his power for revenge.

502
00:33:53,571 --> 00:33:57,513
Releasing the Seven Deadly
Sins into the world.

503
00:34:00,841 --> 00:34:03,682
Millions of lives were lost.

504
00:34:03,945 --> 00:34:08,826
Entire civilizations
erased from existence.

505
00:34:12,236 --> 00:34:15,836
That is why I vowed
never to pass on my magic

506
00:34:15,940 --> 00:34:20,613
until I find one
truly good person.

507
00:34:21,144 --> 00:34:22,715
Strong in spirit.

508
00:34:23,223 --> 00:34:24,652
Pure in heart.

509
00:34:25,672 --> 00:34:29,600
Look, man, maybe this is magic.

510
00:34:29,733 --> 00:34:31,765
I-I don't know, but,

511
00:34:31,910 --> 00:34:35,126
the people you're looking for,
good, pure people...

512
00:34:35,198 --> 00:34:36,925
I'm not one of them.

513
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:40,008
I-I don't know if anyone is, really.

514
00:34:40,220 --> 00:34:45,268
You, Billy Batson, are all I have.

515
00:34:45,390 --> 00:34:47,953
All the world has.

516
00:34:49,627 --> 00:34:51,984
Lay your hands on this staff.

517
00:34:52,071 --> 00:34:53,142
Gross.

518
00:34:53,238 --> 00:34:56,357
And say my name so my
powers may flow through you.

519
00:34:56,582 --> 00:35:00,043
I open my heart to
you, Billy Batson.

520
00:35:00,157 --> 00:35:04,284
And in so doing,
choose you as champion.

521
00:35:04,494 --> 00:35:07,010
Thanks. Don't scream
at me, mister, but

522
00:35:07,035 --> 00:35:08,518
I really gotta get going.

523
00:35:08,689 --> 00:35:12,244
My brothers and sisters
were slain by the sins.

524
00:35:12,401 --> 00:35:15,433
Their thrones lie empty!

525
00:35:15,712 --> 00:35:18,196
My magic must be passed on.

526
00:35:18,439 --> 00:35:19,542
Now...

527
00:35:19,756 --> 00:35:21,629
Speak my name!

528
00:35:21,907 --> 00:35:23,571
I-I don't know your name, sir.

529
00:35:23,602 --> 00:35:24,778
We just met.

530
00:35:24,896 --> 00:35:27,761
My name is...

531
00:35:27,848 --> 00:35:29,491
Shazam.

532
00:35:31,894 --> 00:35:32,973
Wait, for real?

533
00:35:32,998 --> 00:35:34,726
- Say it!
- Okay.

534
00:35:35,164 --> 00:35:36,252
Jeez.

535
00:35:47,386 --> 00:35:48,695
Should I say it?

536
00:35:48,985 --> 00:35:50,163
Like,

537
00:35:50,465 --> 00:35:51,671
Shazam?

538
00:35:52,688 --> 00:35:53,751
Yes!

539
00:35:53,776 --> 00:35:55,072
Carry my name

540
00:35:55,113 --> 00:35:57,187
and with it, you
carry all of my powers.

541
00:35:57,326 --> 00:35:58,616
The wisdom of Solomon!

542
00:35:58,699 --> 00:36:00,016
The strength of Hercules!

543
00:36:00,058 --> 00:36:01,620
The stamina of Atlas!

544
00:36:01,970 --> 00:36:03,351
The power of Zeus!

545
00:36:03,477 --> 00:36:05,023
The courage of Achilles!

546
00:36:05,176 --> 00:36:07,137
And speed of Mercury!

547
00:36:17,279 --> 00:36:19,477
What happened to me?
Why am I...?

548
00:36:19,502 --> 00:36:21,645
W-W-What did you do to me?
What did you do to my voice?

549
00:36:21,684 --> 00:36:25,753
You have been transformed to
your full potential, Billy Batson.

550
00:36:27,110 --> 00:36:30,396
With your heart,
unlock your greatest power.

551
00:36:30,743 --> 00:36:33,568
The thrones of our brothers
and sisters await!

552
00:36:39,929 --> 00:36:41,755
Huh! Oh!

553
00:36:45,583 --> 00:36:47,131
Get me outta here!

554
00:36:49,644 --> 00:36:51,509
Dope!

555
00:36:52,806 --> 00:36:55,750
My brother,
I applaud your choices today.

556
00:36:55,810 --> 00:36:58,167
Gold shoes, gold belt,
white cape!

557
00:36:58,230 --> 00:37:01,716
It shouldn't work,
but, hot damn, it does!

558
00:37:22,772 --> 00:37:26,217
Yes, officer, I'm aware
he's run away in the past, I...

559
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:28,204
23 times?

560
00:37:28,735 --> 00:37:30,497
Guy's got no social
media presence.

561
00:37:30,982 --> 00:37:32,220
At all.

562
00:37:32,418 --> 00:37:34,442
The guy's a ghost.

563
00:37:56,996 --> 00:37:58,877
You know guys,
I'm happy to look for Billy.

564
00:37:59,076 --> 00:38:00,306
More than happy.

565
00:38:00,343 --> 00:38:02,835
Then you gotta wash the dishes,
that's what's more important.

566
00:38:03,026 --> 00:38:05,351
What are you gonna do, Freddy?
Run after him? Ha-ha-ha!

567
00:38:05,429 --> 00:38:06,736
Very funny!

568
00:38:08,532 --> 00:38:09,778
No, wait, don't scream.

569
00:38:09,853 --> 00:38:11,639
Uh, Victor! Victor! Victor!

570
00:38:11,756 --> 00:38:13,446
It's me! It's Billy!
It's Billy!

571
00:38:13,662 --> 00:38:15,855
You asked me,
"Flight or invisibility?"

572
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:17,669
I thought that was stupid,
but now I look like this

573
00:38:17,700 --> 00:38:19,145
and I need your help!

574
00:38:19,305 --> 00:38:21,091
Meet me back here
after lights out?

575
00:38:22,790 --> 00:38:24,346
What's up, bud? You all right?

576
00:38:24,451 --> 00:38:26,205
Yeah. Yeah.

577
00:38:26,414 --> 00:38:27,708
I'm just...

578
00:38:27,914 --> 00:38:29,946
I'm really... sad.

579
00:38:30,129 --> 00:38:31,446
Because Billy's gone.

580
00:38:31,489 --> 00:38:32,639
And you know,

581
00:38:32,695 --> 00:38:34,789
maybe it's my fault.
Maybe I did it.

582
00:38:34,814 --> 00:38:36,521
Uh, you know, maybe I-I snore.

583
00:38:36,568 --> 00:38:39,486
Hey, hey, hey.
Not your fault, son, all right?

584
00:38:40,159 --> 00:38:41,707
We'll find him, 'kay?

585
00:38:42,087 --> 00:38:43,706
You don't snore that bad.

586
00:38:45,092 --> 00:38:46,496
But you kinda smell.

587
00:38:56,479 --> 00:38:58,034
Oh, oh, oh, my God!

588
00:38:58,431 --> 00:39:00,257
Hey, stop right there.

589
00:39:00,394 --> 00:39:03,043
How do I know you're not a
supervillain using telepathic abilities

590
00:39:03,068 --> 00:39:04,937
to make me believe
that you're Billy, huh?

591
00:39:05,022 --> 00:39:07,237
All I have to do is
press dial on this thing.

592
00:39:07,311 --> 00:39:09,851
No, no, I have proof,
I have proof, here.

593
00:39:10,559 --> 00:39:12,661
Look, I lied, okay?
I took your bullet.

594
00:39:12,709 --> 00:39:15,297
- Oop! No, no, no! No!
- No! No!

595
00:39:16,023 --> 00:39:17,753
Stupid adult hands!

596
00:39:17,863 --> 00:39:19,633
But you saw it.
You saw it, right?

597
00:39:19,739 --> 00:39:22,271
Look, Freddy,
I swear it's me, okay?

598
00:39:22,434 --> 00:39:24,179
Look, I know we're not really
close friends or anything,

599
00:39:24,204 --> 00:39:25,410
but you're the only
person that I know

600
00:39:25,435 --> 00:39:27,481
that knows anything about
this Caped Crusader stuff.

601
00:39:27,547 --> 00:39:29,619
- That's Batman.
- What?

602
00:39:30,288 --> 00:39:31,549
Forget it.

603
00:39:32,977 --> 00:39:34,080
Can I...?

604
00:39:35,789 --> 00:39:36,932
Oh, yeah, yeah.

605
00:39:45,116 --> 00:39:46,163
Oh!

606
00:39:46,314 --> 00:39:47,981
Oh, my God!

607
00:39:48,809 --> 00:39:50,063
It's crazy, right?

608
00:39:50,793 --> 00:39:52,230
What are your superpowers?

609
00:39:52,447 --> 00:39:55,201
Superpowers? Dude, I don't even
know how to pee in this thing!

610
00:39:55,281 --> 00:39:57,059
Okay, c-can you fly?

611
00:39:59,890 --> 00:40:01,289
Okay, let's do this.

612
00:40:01,987 --> 00:40:03,162
How do we do this?

613
00:40:03,453 --> 00:40:05,739
Just, um, just like Superman it.

614
00:40:05,928 --> 00:40:07,032
Pkkwwff.

615
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:09,552
Pkkwf.

616
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:11,356
Obviously, you have to jump.

617
00:40:11,627 --> 00:40:12,635
Come on.

618
00:40:12,723 --> 00:40:14,294
How is that even obvious?

619
00:40:14,605 --> 00:40:15,661
Okay.

620
00:40:16,074 --> 00:40:18,923
Try, uh, t-to believe
that you can fly.

621
00:40:18,948 --> 00:40:21,896
Okay, I read this deep dive in the
pyramid studies of superpowers

622
00:40:21,929 --> 00:40:24,421
and in 6 out of 10,
belief is the key.

623
00:40:24,713 --> 00:40:26,783
Belief, belief, belief.
Okay, okay.

624
00:40:26,808 --> 00:40:28,808
I believe I can fly.
I believe I...

625
00:40:29,589 --> 00:40:30,854
I believe I can fly.

626
00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:32,280
I...

627
00:40:40,583 --> 00:40:41,876
Did you believe?

628
00:40:45,381 --> 00:40:46,429
Yeah.

629
00:40:46,683 --> 00:40:48,008
You wanna try invisibility?

630
00:40:49,616 --> 00:40:50,727
How do I do...?

631
00:40:50,798 --> 00:40:53,616
You... Forget it. You know.
Okay, okay, okay.

632
00:40:57,518 --> 00:40:59,296
Oh, my God! It worked!

633
00:40:59,693 --> 00:41:00,867
Where'd you go?

634
00:41:02,214 --> 00:41:03,635
I'm right here.
You can't see me?

635
00:41:03,857 --> 00:41:05,008
Where?

636
00:41:05,932 --> 00:41:07,035
I'm invisible!

637
00:41:07,060 --> 00:41:08,749
I'm right here.
I'm over here.

638
00:41:10,655 --> 00:41:11,702
I'm invisible!

639
00:41:11,845 --> 00:41:12,847
I'm invisible!

640
00:41:12,872 --> 00:41:15,285
Hey! Nice outfit, dipshit!

641
00:41:17,043 --> 00:41:18,162
I-I might have

642
00:41:18,242 --> 00:41:21,299
been testing invisibility and super
intelligence at the same time.

643
00:41:21,667 --> 00:41:23,746
Freeman, I'm gonna come
over there and beat you.

644
00:41:32,099 --> 00:41:33,100
Oh, my God!

645
00:41:33,155 --> 00:41:36,195
The lightning, it was staring us
right in the face the whole time!

646
00:41:37,399 --> 00:41:38,494
Literally!

647
00:41:46,724 --> 00:41:47,764
Okay, okay.

648
00:41:47,803 --> 00:41:49,801
Billy, we gotta give you a
lightning-themed superhero name.

649
00:41:49,843 --> 00:41:50,891
Yeah.

650
00:42:02,211 --> 00:42:03,084
Oh, right.

651
00:42:03,131 --> 00:42:04,592
Hey, you, back...

652
00:42:06,211 --> 00:42:07,219
off.

653
00:42:07,382 --> 00:42:09,287
Hyperspeed, check!

654
00:42:10,967 --> 00:42:12,785
I... I'm sorry-I'm so sorry.

655
00:42:12,810 --> 00:42:14,372
I thought you were the
one who was screaming.

656
00:42:14,421 --> 00:42:16,182
I doused him with pepper spray.

657
00:42:16,773 --> 00:42:18,178
Smart move.

658
00:42:18,203 --> 00:42:19,408
Yeah, hey, get up,
mister mugger guy!

659
00:42:19,433 --> 00:42:21,162
Give the old lady
her purse back.

660
00:42:21,187 --> 00:42:22,703
Um, I'm your age.

661
00:42:22,728 --> 00:42:25,491
And he didn't get a chance to take
it 'cause I didn't let him take it.

662
00:42:25,999 --> 00:42:28,563
Good, yeah, good.
You're really on top of this stuff.

663
00:42:28,607 --> 00:42:30,401
And that should teach
you that old ladies,

664
00:42:30,426 --> 00:42:32,402
regular-aged ladies
like yourself

665
00:42:32,427 --> 00:42:34,100
don't need your protecting.

666
00:42:34,185 --> 00:42:35,550
Right? So get off, bro.

667
00:42:35,614 --> 00:42:37,312
I'm sorry, who are you?

668
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:40,020
His name is Thundercrack!

669
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:41,652
Hero to the people.

670
00:42:41,716 --> 00:42:43,914
With the power and speed
of lightning all in one.

671
00:42:43,956 --> 00:42:45,583
Dude, that sounds
like a butt thing.

672
00:42:47,341 --> 00:42:50,023
- Mr. Philadelphia!
- That's a cream cheese thing, dude!

673
00:42:50,051 --> 00:42:51,590
Powerboy,
'cause he's got all the powers.

674
00:42:51,615 --> 00:42:54,400
'Cause sometimes pepper spray
can't protect against evil.

675
00:42:54,578 --> 00:42:57,110
Powerboy, do you know this child?

676
00:42:58,664 --> 00:43:00,402
Like, like a teeny little bit.

677
00:43:00,427 --> 00:43:01,499
I don't really know...

678
00:43:01,533 --> 00:43:03,787
Yeah, he's, like, my manager.
He's like a miniature manager.

679
00:43:03,813 --> 00:43:05,559
- I'm his manager.
- And uh, you know.

680
00:43:05,584 --> 00:43:08,100
Powerboy's not gonna work either,
okay? So work on something else...

681
00:43:08,163 --> 00:43:09,703
Hey, hey, hey...

682
00:43:14,649 --> 00:43:17,919
Electricity manipulation,
hyperspeed, super strength!

683
00:43:17,976 --> 00:43:19,103
Dude, you're stacked!

684
00:43:19,177 --> 00:43:21,415
You're as cool as Superman!
Almost.

685
00:43:21,598 --> 00:43:23,550
I didn't see you
or what's happened here.

686
00:43:23,681 --> 00:43:25,181
I don't wanna know.
Just don't hurt me.

687
00:43:25,238 --> 00:43:27,024
- Oh, no, no, I'm not gonna hurt you.
- Thank you for your kind donation.

688
00:43:27,049 --> 00:43:28,438
No, no, no, but if you
need any more help,

689
00:43:28,502 --> 00:43:31,152
just look for the superhero
that still can't fly.

690
00:43:31,531 --> 00:43:34,237
Forget flying, man,
we just made 73 bucks!

691
00:43:34,686 --> 00:43:35,749
73 bucks?

692
00:43:36,273 --> 00:43:37,789
Come on!

693
00:43:38,762 --> 00:43:39,826
Hey, wait a minute.

694
00:43:40,682 --> 00:43:42,040
I just got an idea.

695
00:43:42,913 --> 00:43:45,548
I'd like to purchase some
of your finest beer, please.

696
00:44:04,730 --> 00:44:07,540
I don't know about this.
I mean, we don't have a fake ID.

697
00:44:07,565 --> 00:44:09,413
Freddy, would you relax?

698
00:44:09,518 --> 00:44:11,106
Look at me, I am the fake ID.

699
00:44:11,911 --> 00:44:13,975
Everything from the register!
Go! Go!

700
00:44:14,150 --> 00:44:15,756
Now! Come on!

701
00:44:15,781 --> 00:44:17,590
I don't have much time!
Let's go! Move!

702
00:44:17,769 --> 00:44:19,222
I want it all! Hurry!

703
00:44:19,293 --> 00:44:20,436
This is your chance.

704
00:44:20,850 --> 00:44:22,286
Oh! I... okay.

705
00:44:23,772 --> 00:44:25,558
Come on, come on,
let's do this!

706
00:44:29,596 --> 00:44:30,684
Gentlemen!

707
00:44:30,764 --> 00:44:33,597
Why use guns when we can
handle this like real men?

708
00:44:35,936 --> 00:44:37,031
Billy, look out!

709
00:44:49,928 --> 00:44:52,714
Bullet immunity.
You have bullet immunity!

710
00:44:52,876 --> 00:44:54,035
I'm bulletproof.

711
00:44:55,863 --> 00:44:57,966
Today is December 8th,

712
00:44:57,991 --> 00:45:00,636
and this is video proof
of authenticity.

713
00:45:01,327 --> 00:45:02,398
Shoot him again.

714
00:45:02,510 --> 00:45:04,065
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Here, here.

715
00:45:04,113 --> 00:45:06,121
Go, both of you, come on.
Go to town.

716
00:45:13,003 --> 00:45:14,463
W-W-W-Wait!

717
00:45:14,488 --> 00:45:17,679
We still don't know if the suit
is bulletproof or if you are.

718
00:45:19,417 --> 00:45:20,417
Shoot him in the face.

719
00:45:20,442 --> 00:45:22,036
Shoot me in the...
in the face?

720
00:45:30,016 --> 00:45:31,294
It kinda tickles.

721
00:45:32,494 --> 00:45:33,755
You're dead.

722
00:45:39,351 --> 00:45:41,430
- Sorry about your window.
- Have a good night.

723
00:45:41,455 --> 00:45:43,105
But you're welcome
for not getting robbed!

724
00:45:43,361 --> 00:45:44,401
Come on!

725
00:45:44,426 --> 00:45:45,695
Let's get outta here!

726
00:45:46,621 --> 00:45:47,684
Hey.

727
00:45:47,994 --> 00:45:49,399
- To fighting bad guys.
- Yup.

728
00:45:54,890 --> 00:45:56,636
That tastes like actual vomit.

729
00:45:58,369 --> 00:45:59,521
You know,

730
00:45:59,546 --> 00:46:01,519
habanero jerky,
if you eat enough of it,

731
00:46:01,544 --> 00:46:03,170
it could burn a hole
in your stomach.

732
00:46:03,463 --> 00:46:05,018
- Worth it.
- Yeah.

733
00:46:05,043 --> 00:46:07,527
Probably not you though.
Probably got stomach superpowers.

734
00:46:07,552 --> 00:46:08,377
Probably.

735
00:46:08,402 --> 00:46:10,314
Oh, hey, what's up?
I'm a superhero.

736
00:46:10,404 --> 00:46:11,928
Yeah, his name is, uh,

737
00:46:12,026 --> 00:46:13,534
Captain Sparkle Fingers.

738
00:46:13,559 --> 00:46:15,771
No it's not. No it's not!
It's not my name!

739
00:46:15,796 --> 00:46:17,728
Hey, we should hang out.
We're like, the same age.

740
00:46:17,833 --> 00:46:19,460
Ho! po-po. I'm out.

741
00:46:19,817 --> 00:46:21,182
Hey, wait up!

742
00:46:27,681 --> 00:46:29,633
I mean, it's a pretty sick view.

743
00:46:30,214 --> 00:46:33,365
I totally get why Rocky was
training so hard to get up here.

744
00:46:35,667 --> 00:46:38,280
I like you like this.
This is so cool.

745
00:46:39,054 --> 00:46:40,999
I mean, no offense, but like,

746
00:46:41,030 --> 00:46:44,015
Like, at first, you were kinda
like the opposite of how

747
00:46:44,086 --> 00:46:45,528
of how Darla is.

748
00:46:47,324 --> 00:46:48,435
A dick?

749
00:46:48,523 --> 00:46:50,363
Your words, not mine.

750
00:46:50,601 --> 00:46:51,745
But yeah.

751
00:46:53,684 --> 00:46:55,255
All right, well,
I feel like every criminal

752
00:46:55,280 --> 00:46:57,185
was either on drugs
or asleep by now.

753
00:46:57,633 --> 00:46:58,781
Wanna head home?

754
00:46:59,915 --> 00:47:01,092
Looking like this?

755
00:47:01,163 --> 00:47:03,113
Yeah. I mean,

756
00:47:03,138 --> 00:47:05,732
usually we'd have
a lair to go back to, but

757
00:47:05,898 --> 00:47:07,195
that's long term.

758
00:47:07,707 --> 00:47:09,341
Right now you have a bunk bed.

759
00:47:13,911 --> 00:47:16,871
Just scares me thinking of
him out there all alone.

760
00:47:17,094 --> 00:47:19,054
This is what he does, Rosa.

761
00:47:20,369 --> 00:47:22,528
Difference is when
they find him,

762
00:47:22,662 --> 00:47:24,547
we'll be the first
to take him back.

763
00:47:24,969 --> 00:47:26,550
With open arms.

764
00:47:28,719 --> 00:47:31,628
Didn't even make it two days.
Not even two days.

765
00:47:31,686 --> 00:47:34,250
Baby, we did our fair share
of running off back then.

766
00:47:34,345 --> 00:47:36,004
At least, I did.

767
00:47:37,320 --> 00:47:39,852
Even Mary did it, twice.

768
00:47:42,197 --> 00:47:44,030
That second time she ran off,

769
00:47:44,201 --> 00:47:46,312
you said something
that I'll never forget.

770
00:47:46,975 --> 00:47:48,174
You said,

771
00:47:48,270 --> 00:47:50,199
"It's not a home till
you call it a home.

772
00:47:50,678 --> 00:47:52,286
"It's something you choose."

773
00:47:55,050 --> 00:47:58,066
All we can do is
give him a place full of love.

774
00:47:58,801 --> 00:48:00,794
Whether he chooses
to call it a home,

775
00:48:00,873 --> 00:48:02,277
that's up to him.

776
00:48:07,445 --> 00:48:09,033
Gonna help me with this tree?

777
00:48:10,216 --> 00:48:12,119
This tree's so sad.

778
00:48:14,111 --> 00:48:15,119
H-Hello?

779
00:48:15,497 --> 00:48:17,206
Just got done in the bathroom.

780
00:48:17,611 --> 00:48:19,484
Oh, okay, Freddy,
sweetie, goodnight!

781
00:48:19,722 --> 00:48:21,182
- Night.
- Night.

782
00:48:23,016 --> 00:48:24,187
Freddy, who was that?

783
00:48:24,259 --> 00:48:27,513
It's Billy, he's just really tired
and he has laryngitis.

784
00:48:27,538 --> 00:48:29,489
- What? Laryngitis?
- I'm just kidding! I'm just kidding.

785
00:48:29,514 --> 00:48:31,290
He's really, really tired and he
wants to go beddy bye.

786
00:48:31,357 --> 00:48:33,354
- Beddy bye? What's beddy bye?
- Just hide, hide.

787
00:48:33,379 --> 00:48:34,919
Billy, you're back!
Let us see you!

788
00:48:35,716 --> 00:48:37,669
We're so worried about you.

789
00:48:38,467 --> 00:48:40,118
I told you this was a bad idea!

790
00:48:40,388 --> 00:48:41,634
Freddy?

791
00:48:41,896 --> 00:48:43,626
Hey, what happened
to the stairs?

792
00:48:45,928 --> 00:48:47,501
Hey, covering her mouth
like you're gonna kidnap her

793
00:48:47,526 --> 00:48:49,517
is not gonna make her
less scared, okay?

794
00:48:51,927 --> 00:48:53,554
Darla, it's me, it's Billy.

795
00:48:53,601 --> 00:48:55,576
I know I don't look like me.
A wizard made me look like this.

796
00:48:55,601 --> 00:48:56,695
Maybe don't start with wizard,

797
00:48:56,720 --> 00:48:57,987
it's just gonna make
her more confused.

798
00:48:58,012 --> 00:48:59,700
Some old guy brought
me to a temple

799
00:48:59,725 --> 00:49:01,183
and he made me say "Shazam"...

800
00:49:02,751 --> 00:49:03,965
Rosa!

801
00:49:04,456 --> 00:49:06,797
Verbally-triggered body
manipulation properties!

802
00:49:06,822 --> 00:49:08,662
You can switch
by saying "Shazam!"

803
00:49:10,985 --> 00:49:12,771
Baby, was that you?
Are you okay?

804
00:49:13,210 --> 00:49:14,257
Um...

805
00:49:14,781 --> 00:49:16,805
I-I was screwing in a bulb.

806
00:49:17,452 --> 00:49:20,167
Listen to me, Darla. You cannot
tell anybody about this, all right?

807
00:49:20,219 --> 00:49:22,171
But it's Billy, he's a hero.

808
00:49:22,196 --> 00:49:23,576
But if a supervillain
finds out that he's a hero,

809
00:49:23,601 --> 00:49:25,141
that endangers us, okay?

810
00:49:25,166 --> 00:49:27,913
A hero's loved ones are, like,
a perfect bad guy target.

811
00:49:28,354 --> 00:49:29,981
I-Is she good
at keeping secrets?

812
00:49:30,006 --> 00:49:31,046
Moderate.

813
00:49:31,071 --> 00:49:32,395
- No.
- Oh, God.

814
00:49:32,478 --> 00:49:33,858
Okay, listen to me.

815
00:49:33,882 --> 00:49:36,787
You cannot tell a single soul
about this all right? Please.

816
00:49:36,867 --> 00:49:39,105
Why? What if it's
people we trust?

817
00:49:42,305 --> 00:49:44,416
'Cause good sisters
don't tell secrets.

818
00:49:44,593 --> 00:49:47,021
- I'm a good sister.
- Yeah, you are.

819
00:49:47,046 --> 00:49:48,650
You know what would make
you an even better sister?

820
00:49:48,675 --> 00:49:51,159
Is when you fix the-
the doorknob for us.

821
00:49:51,184 --> 00:49:52,191
Sweet dreams.

822
00:49:52,272 --> 00:49:53,302
Sweet dreams, goodnight.

823
00:49:53,358 --> 00:49:54,533
Good night.

824
00:50:00,056 --> 00:50:01,754
Hello, sir, how may I help you?

825
00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:03,214
Hi, sir.

826
00:50:04,108 --> 00:50:05,394
Sir, you can't go in there.

827
00:50:05,584 --> 00:50:07,514
Excuse me!
You cannot go in there!

828
00:50:12,820 --> 00:50:13,943
Sorry I'm late.

829
00:50:13,968 --> 00:50:16,453
Thad, this is for
board members only.

830
00:50:16,550 --> 00:50:18,034
I'm aware of that, Father.

831
00:50:21,567 --> 00:50:22,766
Now...

832
00:50:23,662 --> 00:50:26,385
That night, in the car...

833
00:50:26,872 --> 00:50:28,706
I swore to you
I saw something

834
00:50:28,864 --> 00:50:30,563
but you never believed me.

835
00:50:30,845 --> 00:50:33,885
So much easier to blame
me, wasn't it?

836
00:50:34,785 --> 00:50:37,357
And say that if I hadn't
screamed that night,

837
00:50:37,420 --> 00:50:38,904
you'd still have your legs.

838
00:50:39,870 --> 00:50:41,846
Well, now, I have proof.

839
00:50:44,874 --> 00:50:46,436
That's enough, Thad.

840
00:50:46,461 --> 00:50:47,819
Dear Sid.

841
00:50:48,263 --> 00:50:49,469
You think?

842
00:50:50,492 --> 00:50:53,381
You know,
even before the accident,

843
00:50:53,485 --> 00:50:54,713
you belittled me.

844
00:50:54,747 --> 00:50:57,232
Don't make me throw you
out of here, Thad.

845
00:50:57,737 --> 00:50:59,816
You don't need to make a scene.

846
00:51:00,050 --> 00:51:01,431
Oh, brother...

847
00:51:01,481 --> 00:51:02,989
The scene

848
00:51:03,068 --> 00:51:04,536
has only just begun.

849
00:51:07,493 --> 00:51:09,557
Ask that if you can
throw me out.

850
00:51:09,694 --> 00:51:10,694
What?

851
00:51:10,719 --> 00:51:13,273
Ask the ball if you're man enough
to throw me out of this room.

852
00:51:17,471 --> 00:51:18,900
Let me spoil it for you.

853
00:51:27,554 --> 00:51:28,792
Outlook...

854
00:51:29,363 --> 00:51:30,855
not so good.

855
00:51:32,831 --> 00:51:35,808
I've come here during
the season of giving

856
00:51:36,009 --> 00:51:37,525
to give you...

857
00:51:41,036 --> 00:51:42,734
what you deserve.

858
00:52:39,788 --> 00:52:40,915
Oh, my God!

859
00:52:41,019 --> 00:52:43,170
No! No!

860
00:52:43,464 --> 00:52:44,503
No!

861
00:52:59,479 --> 00:53:00,630
Help!

862
00:53:01,110 --> 00:53:02,721
Somebody!

863
00:53:02,993 --> 00:53:05,501
Help me!

864
00:53:05,908 --> 00:53:08,265
You can't go crying to
other people all the time.

865
00:53:09,835 --> 00:53:13,431
What sin best befits
you, Father? Hmm?

866
00:53:13,559 --> 00:53:15,337
I'll give you anything.

867
00:53:15,633 --> 00:53:16,784
Money...

868
00:53:17,173 --> 00:53:19,165
The company?
You want the company?

869
00:53:19,613 --> 00:53:21,161
There it is.

870
00:53:22,608 --> 00:53:23,798
Greed.

871
00:53:24,199 --> 00:53:26,144
Do you honestly think

872
00:53:26,852 --> 00:53:28,726
all this

873
00:53:28,755 --> 00:53:30,866
material you've accumulated

874
00:53:32,279 --> 00:53:34,779
amounts to actual power?

875
00:53:36,929 --> 00:53:40,206
This... is power.

876
00:53:41,411 --> 00:53:43,546
More than you ever had.

877
00:53:44,085 --> 00:53:46,038
More than anyone has.

878
00:53:47,186 --> 00:53:50,194
There is one more powerful.

879
00:53:50,513 --> 00:53:54,887
The wizard found his champion.

880
00:53:55,006 --> 00:53:56,990
Kill the champion

881
00:53:57,046 --> 00:54:00,728
before he learns
his true potential.

882
00:54:00,753 --> 00:54:03,590
Or he will defeat you.

883
00:54:03,840 --> 00:54:05,690
Show me where to find him.

884
00:54:20,682 --> 00:54:22,730
Oh, Greed...

885
00:54:24,103 --> 00:54:25,492
you can have him.

886
00:54:26,844 --> 00:54:27,844
No.

887
00:54:29,995 --> 00:54:31,003
No!

888
00:54:32,219 --> 00:54:33,362
No!

889
00:54:34,337 --> 00:54:35,400
No!

890
00:54:53,051 --> 00:54:56,749
<i>Family is more
than just a word.</i>

891
00:55:00,304 --> 00:55:01,495
<i>This is family.</i>

892
00:55:25,412 --> 00:55:27,357
Uh, Burke?

893
00:55:29,744 --> 00:55:31,109
Where's the truck?

894
00:55:40,405 --> 00:55:41,707
I can hear it.

895
00:55:51,529 --> 00:55:54,632
- Oh, my God!
- My truck!

896
00:55:55,167 --> 00:55:57,227
- My truck!
- Are you kidding?

897
00:55:57,758 --> 00:55:58,925
You know, guys...

898
00:55:59,583 --> 00:56:01,226
I don't think that's
gonna buff out.

899
00:56:11,057 --> 00:56:13,700
Making the cripple kid

900
00:56:13,766 --> 00:56:16,011
I'm a better lookout.
I can play innocent.

901
00:56:16,036 --> 00:56:17,353
And I can't?

902
00:56:18,444 --> 00:56:20,221
Your face gives off
a very strong vibe

903
00:56:20,246 --> 00:56:21,936
of someone who's
hatching schemes.

904
00:56:22,130 --> 00:56:24,725
- M-My face? This face?
- Yeah!

905
00:56:24,838 --> 00:56:25,988
Okay.

906
00:56:31,770 --> 00:56:33,278
You boys got a hall pass?

907
00:56:33,825 --> 00:56:36,087
Oh, us? Yeah. Always.

908
00:56:36,770 --> 00:56:37,897
You.

909
00:56:40,822 --> 00:56:42,306
You look like
you're up to somethin'.

910
00:56:42,394 --> 00:56:44,791
Me? Up to something?
No. Never.

911
00:56:44,858 --> 00:56:46,040
I'm not up to something.

912
00:56:46,096 --> 00:56:47,675
Our dad's picking us up.

913
00:56:47,754 --> 00:56:50,276
He, uh, he got held up at the...
the business

914
00:56:50,301 --> 00:56:51,310
office.

915
00:56:51,335 --> 00:56:53,111
The business office, huh?

916
00:56:53,235 --> 00:56:54,322
Sure, kid.

917
00:56:54,347 --> 00:56:55,426
Look.

918
00:56:55,451 --> 00:56:59,061
Parents or guardians
must appear physically

919
00:56:59,086 --> 00:57:00,752
to check out students.

920
00:57:00,777 --> 00:57:02,078
Gotcha.

921
00:57:02,245 --> 00:57:04,158
Okay, well, uh,
you hear that, Dad?

922
00:57:04,566 --> 00:57:05,709
- Hey.
- Shazam!

923
00:57:06,230 --> 00:57:07,722
Oh, hey, there, son!

924
00:57:07,762 --> 00:57:10,024
Oh, hey, there, other son
that I also have that's related

925
00:57:10,056 --> 00:57:11,793
to that son I just
passed in the hallway.

926
00:57:11,872 --> 00:57:14,493
I'm so sorry I'm late,
I got held up

927
00:57:14,518 --> 00:57:16,681
at the business office.

928
00:57:16,840 --> 00:57:18,142
Doing all the work stuff.

929
00:57:18,213 --> 00:57:22,108
This is the-the security guard
all the kids admire so much.

930
00:57:22,148 --> 00:57:23,157
Oh.

931
00:57:23,213 --> 00:57:24,853
That's the other one.
This one sucks.

932
00:57:25,075 --> 00:57:27,266
This is... that's not funny.

933
00:57:27,341 --> 00:57:30,452
I gotta talk to him about that.
I apologize.

934
00:57:30,477 --> 00:57:32,033
Anyway, this is me
appearing physically

935
00:57:32,058 --> 00:57:33,692
to check my sons out of school.

936
00:57:33,717 --> 00:57:35,636

01:02:31,035 --> 01:02:33,329
Uh, uh, the Human Powerstorm.

1070
01:02:33,403 --> 01:02:35,403
Frequency Flinger,
Sir-Zaps-A-Lot.

1071
01:02:35,643 --> 01:02:37,421
Yeah, he's a man of many names.

1072
01:02:37,527 --> 01:02:39,606
You know the Red Cyclone?
You?

1073
01:02:39,669 --> 01:02:41,378
Huh. My ass, you do.

1074
01:02:41,458 --> 01:02:43,362
Oh, we're a lot
closer than you think.

1075
01:02:43,540 --> 01:02:45,278
Maybe even at this very moment.

1076
01:02:45,600 --> 01:02:46,632
Prove it.

1077
01:02:46,657 --> 01:02:49,758
I will tomorrow. Tomorrow
he's gonna come to lunch and...

1078
01:02:49,822 --> 01:02:50,998
R-Right, Billy?

1079
01:02:51,055 --> 01:02:52,168
Oh, yeah, and then Superman's

1080
01:02:52,193 --> 01:02:54,271
gonna be bringing us
dessert, right?

1081
01:02:56,789 --> 01:02:58,812
Tomorrow, at lunch.
You'll see.

1082
01:02:58,881 --> 01:03:00,952
And when he doesn't show, then

1083
01:03:00,984 --> 01:03:02,365
we'll kick your ass.

1084
01:03:05,093 --> 01:03:06,601
So wait, my identity's a secret

1085
01:03:06,626 --> 01:03:08,434
so no one I know can get hurt.

1086
01:03:08,858 --> 01:03:10,475
Except when it makes
you look cool, then

1087
01:03:10,500 --> 01:03:11,898
then it's all good.

1088
01:03:11,923 --> 01:03:13,440
Billy, it's not like
they're supervillains

1089
01:03:13,465 --> 01:03:14,758
they're just super douchebags.

1090
01:03:15,475 --> 01:03:17,483
So you're breaking your own rule?

1091
01:03:17,780 --> 01:03:18,939
Got it.

1092
01:03:19,592 --> 01:03:22,100
This thing is as much as
mine as it is yours.

1093
01:03:23,453 --> 01:03:25,374
I'm starting to think you
think it's all your thing.

1094
01:03:25,892 --> 01:03:27,678
Billy, you're still gonna
do it, though, right?

1095
01:03:28,312 --> 01:03:30,164
I mean, what would
a good brother do?

1096
01:03:32,169 --> 01:03:33,565
All hands on deck!

1097
01:03:37,127 --> 01:03:39,881
Thank you for this family.
Thank you for this day.

1098
01:03:39,939 --> 01:03:41,511
Thank you for this food.

1099
01:03:41,566 --> 01:03:43,662
Sorry Billy's hand's on vacay.

1100
01:03:47,475 --> 01:03:50,189
Big news in Philly.
They found a costumed hero.

1101
01:03:50,707 --> 01:03:51,945
He's doing good.

1102
01:03:52,181 --> 01:03:53,808
Yeah, but is he, though?

1103
01:03:54,077 --> 01:03:56,094
Oooh, controversy.

1104
01:03:56,119 --> 01:03:57,128
Into it.

1105
01:03:57,153 --> 01:03:59,975
Share with us your
perspective, Eugene.

1106
01:04:00,368 --> 01:04:03,337
Just saying, he's what?
Charging people's phones?

1107
01:04:03,411 --> 01:04:06,490
So what? I can charge a phone...
with a plug.

1108
01:04:06,524 --> 01:04:07,770
Preach.

1109
01:04:08,020 --> 01:04:10,242
Pedro, any thoughts?

1110
01:04:10,809 --> 01:04:12,245
Costume's stupid?

1111
01:04:13,890 --> 01:04:16,406
Big white cape like, he's
getting married or something.

1112
01:04:16,614 --> 01:04:18,694
What if he didn't get
to pick his costume?

1113
01:04:18,765 --> 01:04:20,599
Ever think about that?

1114
01:04:21,049 --> 01:04:22,970
You're a specialist, Freddy.
What do you think?

1115
01:04:23,058 --> 01:04:24,645
Yeah, Freddy, let's

1116
01:04:24,781 --> 01:04:26,479
manage to see the positive.

1117
01:04:26,665 --> 01:04:28,777
Okay, well, I think
it looks like

1118
01:04:28,889 --> 01:04:30,984
he doesn't have gratitude
for what he's been given.

1119
01:04:31,278 --> 01:04:33,651
Very specific. All right.

1120
01:04:33,719 --> 01:04:34,878
Maybe to this superhero,

1121
01:04:34,903 --> 01:04:36,910
gratitude doesn't mean
having to be clingy.

1122
01:04:37,006 --> 01:04:38,498
"Clingy", wow, interesting take.

1123
01:04:38,575 --> 01:04:40,876
You know, maybe sometimes
a superhero just

1124
01:04:40,901 --> 01:04:42,449
wants a little me time.

1125
01:04:42,474 --> 01:04:44,572
You know, me time can
also be construed as

1126
01:04:44,597 --> 01:04:45,818
pushing away his family.

1127
01:04:45,843 --> 01:04:47,956
Family. Is that
what they are now?

1128
01:04:48,037 --> 01:04:49,807
It's a classic symptom of
superhero syndrome

1129
01:04:49,837 --> 01:04:52,083
coined by German psychologist

1130
01:04:52,108 --> 01:04:54,044
Heinrich de Von...
German something, where

1131
01:04:54,107 --> 01:04:56,690
superpowers become an
all-consuming narcotic.

1132
01:04:58,407 --> 01:05:00,193
Son, we're still eating dinner.

1133
01:05:00,244 --> 01:05:01,823
What he needs is a sidekick.

1134
01:05:01,871 --> 01:05:03,926
Name one cool sidekick.

1135
01:05:04,616 --> 01:05:07,085
Darla, why are you so
quiet over there, baby?

1136
01:05:07,235 --> 01:05:09,020
You're never
at a loss for words.

1137
01:05:09,323 --> 01:05:10,831
I'm eating.

1138
01:05:21,837 --> 01:05:23,416
Why am I still doing this?

1139
01:05:24,268 --> 01:05:25,982
Billy, you can't skip every day.

1140
01:05:26,078 --> 01:05:27,284
Not at your age.

1141
01:05:28,341 --> 01:05:29,643
I'm not your age anymore.

1142
01:05:30,646 --> 01:05:32,567
But I can go with you,
we just gotta

1143
01:05:32,632 --> 01:05:34,450
trick the guard out,
you know, and then...

1144
01:05:34,513 --> 01:05:36,339
Billy, where are you going?

1145
01:05:36,510 --> 01:05:38,121
You're still gonna have
lunch with me, right?

1146
01:05:38,260 --> 01:05:39,419
Billy?

1147
01:05:39,569 --> 01:05:42,546
Sir-Zaps-A-Lot's still gonna
eat in the cafeteria, right?

1148
01:05:48,697 --> 01:05:50,080

1152
01:05:54,138 --> 01:05:55,654
Did you check it?

1153
01:05:56,115 --> 01:05:59,702
People typically, like, give me
a little money, you know, to...

1154
01:05:59,850 --> 01:06:02,120
You're a sweet couple,
you guys have a good day.

1155
01:06:13,894 --> 01:06:15,132
Oh, my God.

1156
01:06:15,157 --> 01:06:16,934
Mary, Mary, are you okay?

1157
01:06:17,118 --> 01:06:18,268
How do you know my name?

1158
01:06:18,293 --> 01:06:20,824
Uh, how do I know
your name, uh...

1159
01:06:20,975 --> 01:06:23,436
Uh, one of my superpowers
is name-guessing.

1160
01:06:23,852 --> 01:06:25,686
Which is really weird, I bet.

1161
01:06:25,711 --> 01:06:28,013
Uh, it's not as cool as super
strength or super speed

1162
01:06:28,038 --> 01:06:30,578
but it's really helpful
when I meet new people.

1163
01:06:31,385 --> 01:06:32,718
Are you hurt?

1164
01:06:32,893 --> 01:06:35,290
No, I'm... I'm okay.

1165
01:06:35,321 --> 01:06:36,869
Thank you, um...

1166
01:06:38,601 --> 01:06:40,371
I just need a second to think.

1167
01:06:41,074 --> 01:06:42,511
This has been such
a weird day.

1168
01:06:42,617 --> 01:06:46,767
Um, using my powers
of super observation,

1169
01:06:46,792 --> 01:06:49,702
I see that you're holding
a letter from a college

1170
01:06:49,765 --> 01:06:53,107
in your hand. Are you upset
because you didn't get in?

1171
01:06:56,774 --> 01:06:58,068
I got in.

1172
01:07:00,143 --> 01:07:02,604
Uh... well, now my
superpowers are failing me

1173
01:07:02,667 --> 01:07:04,425
and I'm very confused.

1174
01:07:05,410 --> 01:07:07,156
Yeah, me too.

1175
01:07:08,105 --> 01:07:10,613
I don't know. I know I should be
excited 'cause this is my dream

1176
01:07:10,638 --> 01:07:12,914
and I worked really,
really hard for this.

1177
01:07:13,736 --> 01:07:15,062
But it's like...

1178
01:07:17,678 --> 01:07:20,329
I don't know, leaving my family
does not feel fun, you know?

1179
01:07:20,419 --> 01:07:23,085
Can I-Can I-Can I give you
a little piece of advice?

1180
01:07:23,391 --> 01:07:25,191
Don't be worried about
everybody else.

1181
01:07:25,224 --> 01:07:27,017
Always look out for number one.

1182
01:07:27,107 --> 01:07:29,274
- Gandhi said that.
- I don't think he said that.

1183
01:07:29,335 --> 01:07:31,143
- Yeah, he did.
- Gandhi did not say that.

1184
01:07:31,168 --> 01:07:32,906
- Somebody like Gandhi said that.
- Take care of number one?

1185
01:07:32,946 --> 01:07:35,113
It was a really wi...
It might have been Yoda.

1186
01:07:35,143 --> 01:07:36,389
- Listen.
- I'm sorry, no.

1187
01:07:36,414 --> 01:07:38,302
Agree to disagree.
The point is...

1188
01:07:38,357 --> 01:07:40,683
You do you, you know?
You gotta look out for you.

1189
01:07:40,733 --> 01:07:43,304
And get as far away from
this place as you can.

1190
01:07:45,183 --> 01:07:46,660
I don't know if I want to.

1191
01:07:46,685 --> 01:07:48,272
Of course you do.
What are you gonna do?

1192
01:07:48,297 --> 01:07:50,398
You're gonna live in a group
home for the rest of your life?

1193
01:07:52,096 --> 01:07:54,326
Look, families are for people who
can't take care of themselves.

1194
01:07:54,351 --> 01:07:56,311
Okay? So.

1195
01:07:57,160 --> 01:07:59,468
And you know, y-you can take
care of yourself, you know.

1196
01:07:59,493 --> 01:08:01,469
Also, look both ways
when you cross the street.

1197
01:08:06,419 --> 01:08:07,911
I'll just call him.

1198
01:08:11,868 --> 01:08:13,043
It's ringing.

1199
01:08:15,522 --> 01:08:17,514
Red Cyclone! Hey!
Hey, what's goin' on?

1200
01:08:18,390 --> 01:08:20,152
Oh, that's crazy.
Yeah, it's Freddy, by the way.

1201
01:08:20,177 --> 01:08:21,509
Yeah, it's crazy.
That is...

1202
01:08:21,534 --> 01:08:22,747
Great story.

1203
01:08:23,726 --> 01:08:24,988
He's not talking.

1204
01:08:26,689 --> 01:08:28,379
I was! I was!

1205
01:08:28,509 --> 01:08:30,081
We're friends.
I know him. I do.

1206
01:08:30,184 --> 01:08:31,430
I know... I know...

1207
01:08:36,080 --> 01:08:37,112
Shit.

1208
01:08:41,409 --> 01:08:42,583

Whoa, whoa, whoa!

1215
01:08:54,745 --> 01:08:56,343
I'm in the middle
of a show right now.

1216
01:08:56,370 --> 01:08:57,655
How can I help you?

1217
01:08:57,680 --> 01:09:00,409
I just wanna say thank you
for showing up to lunch today.

1218
01:09:00,674 --> 01:09:03,935
Yeah, I got a little something
called a suitcase wedgie, right?

1219
01:09:03,960 --> 01:09:05,634
I don't know if you've ever
heard of it, but it's when

1220
01:09:05,659 --> 01:09:07,670
someone grabs your
underwear like that

1221
01:09:07,695 --> 01:09:08,901
and hold you like a suitcase,

1222
01:09:08,926 --> 01:09:10,516
walks you down the hallway.

1223
01:09:10,741 --> 01:09:13,011
And this was my underwear.

1224
01:09:15,720 --> 01:09:16,878
Gross.

1225
01:09:17,277 --> 01:09:18,486
You said you'd come.

1226
01:09:18,511 --> 01:09:20,547
You said I will come,
I never said I was...

1227
01:09:20,837 --> 01:09:22,377
I'm a superhero, dude.

1228
01:09:22,440 --> 01:09:23,908
Well, you're acting real heroic.

1229
01:09:24,131 --> 01:09:25,702
How much are people
paying you today?

1230
01:09:25,802 --> 01:09:29,119
Listen, I have serious
responsibilities now, okay?

1231
01:09:29,191 --> 01:09:31,453
But that's cool because I can
carry that burden with my...

01:09:31,478 --> 01:09:34,100

1233
01:10:00,189 --> 01:10:01,467

Don't move!

1235
01:10:05,008 --> 01:10:06,497
Nobody move!

1236
01:10:15,047 --> 01:10:16,277
Oh, no.

1237
01:10:16,507 --> 01:10:18,103
No, no, no, no, no.

01:10:28,298 --> 01:10:29,433
Oh.

1240
01:10:29,854 --> 01:10:31,377
Oh, that looked like it hurts.

1241
01:10:31,524 --> 01:10:32,778
It's him!

1242
01:10:32,850 --> 01:10:34,516
It's the superhero guy!

1243
01:10:35,362 --> 01:10:36,529
Save us!

1244
01:10:37,370 --> 01:10:38,505
Come on.

1245
01:10:40,416 --> 01:10:41,558
Come...

1246
01:10:43,338 --> 01:10:45,409
What's he doing?
What's going on?

1247
01:10:54,548 --> 01:10:55,556
What?

1248
01:11:03,045 --> 01:11:05,291
Oh, no. Oh, no, no.
Please don't make me do this.

1249
01:11:05,621 --> 01:11:07,319
That is the worst idea ever!

1250
01:11:17,098 --> 01:11:19,694
Oho! Oh, I did it!

1251
01:11:19,735 --> 01:11:20,894
I did it!

1252
01:11:20,958 --> 01:11:23,085
I got the bus!
I got the bus.

1253
01:11:23,279 --> 01:11:24,501
Nobody move in there!

1254
01:11:24,804 --> 01:11:26,733
I gotta put this thing down,
I gotta put this thing down.

1255
01:11:32,719 --> 01:11:35,427
No, no, no, doggie, doggie,
you have to move. Move!

1256
01:11:35,452 --> 01:11:36,602
Shoo! Shoo!

1257
01:11:36,627 --> 01:11:38,459
Please be a good dog.
Good dog!

1258
01:11:38,484 --> 01:11:40,041
Ooh, you're being a bad dog.

1259
01:11:40,066 --> 01:11:41,495
Go! Go!

1260
01:11:42,317 --> 01:11:43,888
Please go. Please move.

1261
01:11:44,829 --> 01:11:46,718
Yes, thank you.
Thank you. Thank you.

1262
01:11:47,249 --> 01:11:48,368
Thank you.

1263
01:12:04,401 --> 01:12:05,425
Yeah.

1264
01:12:05,622 --> 01:12:07,567
Yeah, no, no, no, my f...

1265
01:12:07,599 --> 01:12:09,728
I was in the neighborhood,
you know, so I thought...

1266
01:12:09,753 --> 01:12:10,832
Thank you, thank you.

1267
01:12:10,857 --> 01:12:12,927
You know, it's kinda
my fault, anyway.

1268
01:12:15,720 --> 01:12:19,283
So, it seems Philadelphia has
gotten an early Christmas present

1269
01:12:19,317 --> 01:12:23,161
in the form of
its very own superhero.

1270
01:12:23,228 --> 01:12:24,704
And we're out.

1271
01:12:25,069 --> 01:12:26,942
- Hey, thank you very much.
- Oh, of course, yeah.

1272
01:12:26,967 --> 01:12:29,309
Dude! Dude, dude!
Dude, did you see that?

1273
01:12:29,542 --> 01:12:32,733
Yeah, you electrocuted a bus
and almost killed these people.

1274
01:12:32,911 --> 01:12:34,696
And then I caught it!

1275
01:12:34,947 --> 01:12:38,352
Freddy! I caught a bus
with my bare hands, man!

1276
01:12:38,377 --> 01:12:40,705
I caught a bus like people
catch fly balls, like...

1277
01:12:40,729 --> 01:12:41,998
Who does that? I do that.

1278
01:12:42,023 --> 01:12:43,683
Billy, you do nothing, you...

1279
01:12:43,755 --> 01:12:46,390
you take selfies and
make people pay you.

1280
01:12:46,554 --> 01:12:47,577
You know what, forget it.

1281
01:12:47,602 --> 01:12:49,888
I can't really talk to you
when you look like this.

1282
01:12:50,134 --> 01:12:51,491
You just wish it was you.

1283
01:12:52,392 --> 01:12:53,535
No shit.

1284
01:12:54,140 --> 01:12:55,187
You think?

1285
01:12:55,212 --> 01:12:57,275
I would kill to have
what you have.

1286
01:12:57,883 --> 01:12:59,446
'Cause everything I do

1287
01:12:59,510 --> 01:13:01,185
is like, some-some
desperate attempt

1288
01:13:01,225 --> 01:13:02,986
to get people to notice me.

1289
01:13:03,158 --> 01:13:04,602
To not feel sorry for me.

1290
01:13:04,922 --> 01:13:06,397
I mean, look at me.
Look at me.

1291
01:13:06,422 --> 01:13:07,853
Do you even see me?

1292
01:13:08,274 --> 01:13:09,925
'Cause most people don't.

1293
01:13:10,753 --> 01:13:12,118
'Cause they don't want to.

1294
01:13:12,915 --> 01:13:14,241
And you don't either.

1295
01:13:15,220 --> 01:13:16,910
I mean, you think
this is who you are?

1296
01:13:17,475 --> 01:13:19,037
I mean, Billy, you're 14.

1297
01:13:19,062 --> 01:13:20,848
And now you're no
better than the Breyers.

1298
01:13:21,485 --> 01:13:23,162
All this power,

1299
01:13:23,209 --> 01:13:26,177
and all you did was turn
into a showoff and a bully.

1300
01:13:28,729 --> 01:13:29,856
Whatever, kid.

1301
01:13:29,944 --> 01:13:31,364
I do what I want!

1302
01:13:33,136 --> 01:13:35,437
And I'm like mid-20s, probably.

1303
01:13:36,512 --> 01:13:38,059
Maybe even, like, 30.

1304
01:13:41,802 --> 01:13:43,167
Chosen one.

1305
01:13:46,681 --> 01:13:48,768
The so-called perfect man.

1306
01:13:50,233 --> 01:13:51,534
Pure of heart.

1307
01:13:52,756 --> 01:13:54,582
Flawless in every way.

1308
01:13:57,159 --> 01:13:58,802
What made you so worthy?

1309
01:13:58,916 --> 01:14:00,900
I'm sorry, can I help...
can I help...?

1310
01:14:01,019 --> 01:14:02,527
D'you want a autograph
or somethin'?

1311
01:14:02,552 --> 01:14:03,886
Give me your power.

1312
01:14:06,519 --> 01:14:07,725
Or die.

1313
01:14:07,773 --> 01:14:09,281
Oh, snap.

1314
01:14:09,952 --> 01:14:11,349
You're like a bad guy, right?

1315
01:14:11,391 --> 01:14:12,405
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

1316
01:14:12,430 --> 01:14:14,446
Look, before this gets
really stupid for you,

1317
01:14:14,526 --> 01:14:16,502
you should know that
I'm basically invincible.

1318
01:14:25,373 --> 01:14:28,169
The weapons of man draw
no blood from our kind.

1319
01:14:28,194 --> 01:14:29,214
This is the...

1320
01:14:30,393 --> 01:14:33,504
The only thing that
extinguishes magic

1321
01:14:33,608 --> 01:14:34,973
is magic.

1322
01:14:36,270 --> 01:14:38,485
Time to transfer
your power to me.

1323
01:14:41,327 --> 01:14:44,819
Oho, you did not see that one
coming, did you, grandpa?

1324
01:14:45,004 --> 01:14:46,472
Them's street rules!

1325
01:14:56,143 --> 01:14:57,460
Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay!

1326
01:14:57,485 --> 01:14:59,451
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

1327
01:14:59,488 --> 01:15:01,188
I never should've punched
you in the nuts like that.

1328
01:15:01,213 --> 01:15:02,436
That was totally my bad.

1329
01:15:02,500 --> 01:15:03,809
We can talk about this.

1330
01:15:03,937 --> 01:15:05,310
You grovel like a child.

1331
01:15:05,345 --> 01:15:07,606
That's because I am one.
I-I'm a kid.

1332
01:15:07,631 --> 01:15:09,075
You don't want to
hurt a kid, do you?

1333
01:15:12,084 --> 01:15:13,203
I believe I can fly!

1334
01:15:13,228 --> 01:15:14,849
I believe I can fly!
I can fly!

1335
01:15:14,874 --> 01:15:16,283
Freddy said if I believe,
I can fly!

1336
01:15:16,308 --> 01:15:17,863
Then I can fly, so I believe!

1337
01:15:17,952 --> 01:15:19,182
I believe, oh, please!

1338
01:15:19,232 --> 01:15:20,764
Okay! Superman!

1339
01:15:20,789 --> 01:15:23,192
Superman!
What arm is it?!

1340
01:15:23,262 --> 01:15:24,754
Why am I not flying?!

1341
01:15:24,779 --> 01:15:26,642
Please, I don't wanna die!

1342
01:15:42,853 --> 01:15:43,877
Oh.

1343
01:15:45,830 --> 01:15:46,877
Whoa.

1344
01:15:47,173 --> 01:15:48,252
Whoa.

1345
01:15:48,887 --> 01:15:50,506
I'm floating!

1346
01:16:03,824 --> 01:16:05,197
I can fly!

1347
01:16:11,246 --> 01:16:12,388
Billy?

1348
01:16:13,734 --> 01:16:15,519
Freddy! I need your help!

1349
01:16:15,694 --> 01:16:16,972
You can fly?

1350
01:16:25,165 --> 01:16:26,490
Who's the other guy?

1351
01:16:26,794 --> 01:16:28,214
Santa!

1352
01:16:31,073 --> 01:16:34,861
So, like, what you and Mrs.
Claus do in the summertime?

1353
01:16:35,057 --> 01:16:37,518
Well, in some ways,

1354
01:16:37,661 --> 01:16:39,534
Santa's always here for you.

1355
01:16:44,379 --> 01:16:45,482
Oh, help!

1356
01:16:46,673 --> 01:16:48,046
Help Santa!

1357
01:16:48,375 --> 01:16:50,272
Santa needs help!

1358
01:16:50,927 --> 01:16:52,292
Give us a shout if you need us.

1359
01:16:59,118 --> 01:17:02,150
I'm just gonna chill in here for
a little while, if that's okay.

1360
01:17:05,537 --> 01:17:06,664
This is crazy!

1361
01:17:06,983 --> 01:17:08,531
This is crazy. You don't
have to fight this guy.

1362
01:17:08,556 --> 01:17:10,602
This isn't your job.
You can run, right?

1363
01:17:10,758 --> 01:17:13,162
Yes! You can run. Awesome.

1364
01:17:21,521 --> 01:17:22,743
Get back!

1365
01:17:22,807 --> 01:17:24,497
Just get... Get away!

1366
01:17:26,454 --> 01:17:28,533
<i>I'm Batman.</i>
Get him, Batman!

1367
01:17:58,589 --> 01:17:59,756
Come on!

1368
01:18:25,274 --> 01:18:27,226
Sh... Shazam!

1369
01:18:57,202 --> 01:18:58,393
Billy!

1370
01:18:59,349 --> 01:19:00,603
Billy!

1371
01:19:02,167 --> 01:19:03,413
Billy, where are you?

1372
01:19:06,705 --> 01:19:07,760
Billy!

1373
01:19:08,998 --> 01:19:10,276
Where are you, Billy?

1374
01:19:14,744 --> 01:19:15,887
Billy, come on!

1375
01:19:18,910 --> 01:19:20,013
Billy.

1376
01:19:20,904 --> 01:19:23,134
- Where is he?
- Um, supervillain.

1377
01:19:23,605 --> 01:19:25,851
Supervillain! Supervillain!

1378
01:19:26,984 --> 01:19:28,158
Worse.

1379
01:19:28,571 --> 01:19:29,801
Much worse.

1380
01:19:30,051 --> 01:19:31,416
Radioactive anthromorph.

1381
01:19:31,456 --> 01:19:33,265
Psychic energy manipulator.

1382
01:19:33,561 --> 01:19:34,814
I won't let you read my mind.

1383
01:19:34,839 --> 01:19:36,966
My mind is blank.
You can't get in.

1384
01:19:36,991 --> 01:19:38,620
I don't need to read your mind.

1385
01:19:39,193 --> 01:19:41,170
Because you are going to tell me.

1386
01:19:41,783 --> 01:19:43,164
Where is he?

1387
01:19:55,504 --> 01:19:56,846
Oh, my God, are you okay?

1388
01:19:58,084 --> 01:19:59,092
You okay?

1389
01:19:59,615 --> 01:20:00,940
What happened?
Are you hurt?

1390
01:20:01,038 --> 01:20:02,189
Come inside.

1391
01:20:02,300 --> 01:20:03,474
We need to have a talk.

1392
01:20:04,923 --> 01:20:06,558
Just don't be too
hard on him, okay?

1393
01:20:13,014 --> 01:20:15,562
Running out on us.
Lying.

1394
01:20:15,718 --> 01:20:17,130
Then I get a call
from the school

1395
01:20:17,155 --> 01:20:19,075
telling me you've
been cutting class.

1396
01:20:19,332 --> 01:20:20,609
Getting in fights.

1397
01:20:26,893 --> 01:20:28,829
Whoa, is that...?

1398
01:20:31,149 --> 01:20:33,419
What's Freddy doing
with a superhero?

1399
01:20:36,747 --> 01:20:39,970
What's this superhero
doing with Freddy?

1400
01:20:43,443 --> 01:20:44,848
You remember dinner?

1401
01:20:44,873 --> 01:20:46,904
When Billy and
Freddy were arguing

1402
01:20:46,971 --> 01:20:48,701
like an old married
couple like this?

1403
01:20:50,038 --> 01:20:52,712
When he rescued me, he
knew I lived in a group home.

1404
01:20:52,744 --> 01:20:54,800
He knew my name.
He called me Mary.

1405
01:21:03,289 --> 01:21:04,368
Wait.

1406
01:21:04,393 --> 01:21:06,797
Are you saying Billy's
the Human Powerstorm?

1407
01:21:06,847 --> 01:21:08,672
Yes! You guys figured it out!

1408
01:21:08,746 --> 01:21:10,340
All on your own.
I didn't help.

1409
01:21:10,365 --> 01:21:11,643
I didn't break any promises.

1410
01:21:11,668 --> 01:21:12,838
You knew?

1411
01:21:12,918 --> 01:21:14,513
I'm a good sister!

1412
01:21:18,719 --> 01:21:20,116
I mean, what were you thinking?

1413
01:21:21,338 --> 01:21:22,918
Then you bring Freddy into it.

1414
01:21:28,937 --> 01:21:31,850
Give him some space, guys.
He's a little upset. Okay?

1415
01:21:41,963 --> 01:21:43,042
Billy?

1416
01:21:48,145 --> 01:21:49,463
You're him.

1417
01:21:50,526 --> 01:21:51,955
You're the hero.

1418
01:21:53,118 --> 01:21:55,499
Yeah, well, not anymore, so.

1419
01:21:59,614 --> 01:22:01,455
Why do you have my notebook?

1420
01:22:04,288 --> 01:22:06,153
Eugene finished you search.

1421
01:22:06,816 --> 01:22:09,022
Look, I'm not a hacker, okay?

1422
01:22:09,255 --> 01:22:11,699
But I have played
Watchdogs and Uplink.

1423
01:22:11,765 --> 01:22:13,899
And maybe I did
pick up a few skills

1424
01:22:13,932 --> 01:22:16,012
which maybe did get me
into federal databases

1425
01:22:16,037 --> 01:22:17,258
most people can't get into, but...

1426
01:22:17,325 --> 01:22:19,103
Good for you,
but I'm gonna go.

1427
01:22:19,479 --> 01:22:22,661
Your parents' names
are Marilyn and C.C. Batson.

1428
01:22:28,181 --> 01:22:29,268
What?

1429
01:22:29,436 --> 01:22:31,381
You were born in
Zumbrota, Minnesota.

1430
01:22:31,677 --> 01:22:33,352
They divorced when
you were three.

1431
01:22:33,600 --> 01:22:35,037
Your mom moved here that year.

1432
01:22:35,284 --> 01:22:37,062
20 months later, you got lost.

1433
01:22:37,479 --> 01:22:39,931
You never found them 'cause
your dad's been in prison

1434
01:22:39,956 --> 01:22:41,479
in Florida for 10 years.

1435
01:22:41,680 --> 01:22:43,037
And your mom's...

1436
01:22:44,834 --> 01:22:45,865
What?

1437
01:22:47,421 --> 01:22:48,508
Is she dead?

1438
01:22:49,123 --> 01:22:51,251
She's two subway stops away.

1439
01:22:52,235 --> 01:22:53,259
What?

1440
01:22:54,270 --> 01:22:55,277
You know, you didn't find her

1441
01:22:55,302 --> 01:22:57,573
because she reverted
to her maiden name.

1442
01:23:01,833 --> 01:23:04,230
Hey, Billy! Billy!

1443
01:23:07,442 --> 01:23:08,878
Victor, get the keys.

1444
01:23:08,903 --> 01:23:11,077
Kids, stay here,
in case Billy comes back.

1445
01:23:19,339 --> 01:23:21,005
Get inside. Let's go.

1446
01:23:29,424 --> 01:23:32,336
Wait. I thought we were
running after Billy?

1447
01:23:32,515 --> 01:23:35,118
No, we're gonna
wait here for now.

1448
01:23:38,584 --> 01:23:39,743
Billy?

1449
01:23:42,636 --> 01:23:43,700
Freddy?

1450
01:23:47,998 --> 01:23:49,831
Oh, how quaint.

1451
01:23:53,139 --> 01:23:55,170
Actually, I take that back.

1452
01:23:57,035 --> 01:23:58,662
What a shithole.

1453
01:24:42,143 --> 01:24:43,413
Just a second.

1454
01:24:48,052 --> 01:24:49,536
Hey, look, I'm late for
work already, all right?

1455
01:24:49,561 --> 01:24:51,719
We don't need any
magazines or whatever.

1456
01:24:51,767 --> 01:24:53,322
Oh, I'm not.

1457
01:24:54,469 --> 01:24:56,184
You probably don't
recognize me, but

1458
01:24:58,211 --> 01:24:59,766
I found my way home.

1459
01:25:01,214 --> 01:25:02,230
Mom.

1460
01:25:04,161 --> 01:25:05,296
It's me.

1461
01:25:06,671 --> 01:25:07,710
Oh, God.

1462
01:25:09,311 --> 01:25:10,335
Is it?

1463
01:25:12,946 --> 01:25:14,771
Um, hang on.

1464
01:25:16,541 --> 01:25:17,818
Who's at the door?

1465
01:25:19,065 --> 01:25:20,240
It's um...

1466
01:25:20,906 --> 01:25:22,676
It's no one, Travis.

1467
01:25:27,561 --> 01:25:29,061
That wasn't Dad, was it?

1468
01:25:30,128 --> 01:25:31,342
No, I...

1469
01:25:32,156 --> 01:25:34,886
Listen, it's um...

1470
01:25:36,867 --> 01:25:38,041
It's really you, huh?

1471
01:25:40,505 --> 01:25:42,068
I didn't mean to run away.

1472
01:25:42,941 --> 01:25:44,235
You know that, right?

1473
01:25:44,939 --> 01:25:47,613
I let go but it was by
accident, I...

1474
01:25:47,725 --> 01:25:49,415
Yeah, I know, I know.

1475
01:25:50,020 --> 01:25:51,822
I saw you.

1476
01:25:52,835 --> 01:25:53,843
What?

1477
01:25:57,220 --> 01:25:58,895
I saw you after.

1478
01:26:01,480 --> 01:26:04,170
So, it was never your fault.

1479
01:26:05,714 --> 01:26:07,619
I was 17.

1480
01:26:08,177 --> 01:26:09,883
And my dad, he kicked me out.

1481
01:26:10,258 --> 01:26:12,234
And your dad just...

1482
01:26:12,370 --> 01:26:14,742
decided not to be
a part of anything.

1483
01:26:15,287 --> 01:26:18,247
And I was hurting
and I was screwed up.

1484
01:26:20,507 --> 01:26:21,523
I wanted the tiger.

1485
01:26:21,548 --> 01:26:23,817
I know, I know, honey, but

1486
01:26:24,123 --> 01:26:26,250
Mom's not exactly going pro
here, okay?

1487
01:26:29,311 --> 01:26:30,431
Billy?

1488
01:26:31,177 --> 01:26:32,296
Billy!

1489
01:26:33,251 --> 01:26:34,426
Billy!

1490
01:26:34,926 --> 01:26:37,204
Jesus Christ, Billy,
this isn't funny!

1491
01:26:37,928 --> 01:26:38,928
Here you go, buddy.

1492
01:26:44,904 --> 01:26:47,801
But it's just once
I saw you with the police,

1493
01:26:48,206 --> 01:26:49,821
I realized that

1494
01:26:49,932 --> 01:26:53,360
they could do a better job taking
care of you than I ever will.

1495
01:26:58,529 --> 01:27:00,021
But you're good, right?

1496
01:27:01,697 --> 01:27:03,604
I mean you landed on your feet.

1497
01:27:04,779 --> 01:27:06,255
'Cause, I mean, you look real good.

1498
01:27:08,960 --> 01:27:10,412
It's just...

1499
01:27:12,264 --> 01:27:15,311
Now is not a really
good time for me, Billy.

1500
01:27:19,804 --> 01:27:21,931
All I wanted to do was

1501
01:27:23,293 --> 01:27:25,158
let you know
I'm doing good, but...

1502
01:27:26,588 --> 01:27:29,318
I have to get back
to my real family, so.

1503
01:27:31,462 --> 01:27:32,652
Here.

1504
01:27:36,300 --> 01:27:37,610
What's this?

1505
01:27:38,080 --> 01:27:40,819
Marilyn! What's
going on out there?

1506
01:27:41,485 --> 01:27:43,088
You might need it
more than me.

1507
01:28:00,909 --> 01:28:03,488
Freddy, you were right.
Sorry I yelled at you.

1508
01:28:03,513 --> 01:28:04,996
<i>Come home, Billy.</i>

1509
01:28:05,644 --> 01:28:07,089
<i>Come home.</i>

1510
01:28:07,256 --> 01:28:10,406
<i>Billy! Supervillain!
Supervillain!</i>

1511
01:28:26,959 --> 01:28:27,967
Shazam!

1512
01:28:41,902 --> 01:28:44,227
Who are you?
What do you want?

1513
01:28:44,419 --> 01:28:45,816
What do I want?

1514
01:28:46,715 --> 01:28:47,961
I want...

1515
01:28:52,981 --> 01:28:54,251
That.

1516
01:28:55,143 --> 01:28:56,437
Whoa.

1517
01:29:00,044 --> 01:29:01,354
Kick his ass, Billy!

1518
01:29:04,189 --> 01:29:05,197
Oh, God.

1519
01:29:05,222 --> 01:29:06,333
Yes, Billy.

1520
01:29:06,596 --> 01:29:08,073
Try it, by all means.

1521
01:29:08,669 --> 01:29:10,312
Let them go and I'll come inside.

1522
01:29:10,651 --> 01:29:12,770
Oh, first you come inside,

1523
01:29:12,834 --> 01:29:14,762
then maybe I'll let them go.

1524
01:29:31,561 --> 01:29:33,037
Good boy.

1525
01:29:35,506 --> 01:29:37,506
'Cause that's all you are, isn't it?

1526
01:29:38,315 --> 01:29:39,632
How old are you?

1527
01:29:39,910 --> 01:29:42,339
- Basically, 15.
- Hmm.

1528
01:29:44,099 --> 01:29:45,718
When I was a child,

1529
01:29:45,814 --> 01:29:47,917
the old man told me
I wasn't good enough.

1530
01:29:47,996 --> 01:29:49,409
And here you are,

1531
01:29:49,806 --> 01:29:51,282
a coward.

1532
01:29:52,043 --> 01:29:53,444
Run from me?

1533
01:29:53,891 --> 01:29:56,113
And that wizard chooses you.
You're not a hero.

1534
01:29:56,623 --> 01:29:59,457
But I'm gonna give you
the opportunity to be one.

1535
01:30:00,093 --> 01:30:01,902
Give me the power
of a champion.

1536
01:30:02,040 --> 01:30:03,603
No, don't do it, Billy!

1537
01:30:20,273 --> 01:30:21,599
Give me the power

1538
01:30:22,093 --> 01:30:23,140
and I'll let them go.

1539
01:30:23,165 --> 01:30:24,394
Darla, no.

1540
01:30:24,476 --> 01:30:26,166
Don't, don't go, Billy!

1541
01:30:26,327 --> 01:30:28,438
Don't go! Don't go, Billy!

1542
01:30:28,533 --> 01:30:30,588
No, no, I-I have to,
I have to, it's...

1543
01:30:30,919 --> 01:30:33,935
It's what a good brother
would do, right?

1544
01:30:38,570 --> 01:30:39,760
Billy.

1545
01:31:06,106 --> 01:31:08,765
I dedicated my life
to getting here.

1546
01:31:10,041 --> 01:31:11,446
I scoured the earth.

1547
01:31:11,993 --> 01:31:13,351
No one believed me.

1548
01:31:14,404 --> 01:31:15,507
No one helped.

1549
01:31:16,492 --> 01:31:17,492
Not the wizard.

1550
01:31:18,921 --> 01:31:20,159
Not my family.

1551
01:31:22,116 --> 01:31:23,696
I only had myself.

1552
01:31:24,453 --> 01:31:25,572
I get it.

1553
01:31:27,009 --> 01:31:28,358
I get what that's like.

1554
01:31:30,444 --> 01:31:32,127
Feeling like you're
all alone in the world.

1555
01:31:32,286 --> 01:31:33,365
Stand.

1556
01:31:34,001 --> 01:31:36,763
Feeling like there's that one
thing, if you could just find it.

1557
01:31:36,894 --> 01:31:38,638
Then you'd finally
be good enough.

1558
01:31:38,735 --> 01:31:39,878
Stand.

1559
01:31:42,098 --> 01:31:43,868
The champion's name.

1560
01:31:45,352 --> 01:31:46,487
Say it.

1561
01:32:13,814 --> 01:32:14,972
Look, no offense, mister,

1562
01:32:14,997 --> 01:32:18,036
but I don't think these things
have your best interest at heart.

1563
01:32:18,343 --> 01:32:21,462
Don't listen to this child.

1564
01:32:21,712 --> 01:32:23,783
Take the staff.

1565
01:32:24,166 --> 01:32:29,270
Hold it and say
the champion's name.

1566
01:32:29,362 --> 01:32:30,823
They're using you.

1567
01:32:31,426 --> 01:32:33,989
You have to see that.
That they are using you.

1568
01:32:34,042 --> 01:32:35,376
Say your name.

1569
01:32:38,826 --> 01:32:40,151
His name...

1570
01:32:40,786 --> 01:32:42,890
is Captain Sparklefingers.

1571
01:32:42,949 --> 01:32:44,559
And we're gonna
keep throwing things

1572
01:32:44,593 --> 01:32:46,712
at your big, fat, ugly ass head

1573
01:32:46,807 --> 01:32:48,735
until you let our brother go.

1574
01:33:13,826 --> 01:33:15,858
Boy, am I glad I didn't
sell that batarang.

1575
01:33:16,043 --> 01:33:17,297
Pedro, is that a lamp?

1576
01:33:17,378 --> 01:33:19,561
- It's an ugly one.
- Come on, come on, come on.

1577
01:33:19,685 --> 01:33:21,812
Guys, I appreciate the
thought, I really do.

1578
01:33:21,851 --> 01:33:23,470
But I don't think your
weapons are gonna help.

1579
01:33:23,495 --> 01:33:25,018
You can put 'em down now.

1580
01:33:26,404 --> 01:33:27,841
The door was right here.

1581
01:33:27,916 --> 01:33:29,146
Billy, how do we
get out of here?

1582
01:33:29,416 --> 01:33:31,211
What, you think I know?
I don't know.

1583
01:33:31,975 --> 01:33:33,006
This way!

1584
01:33:33,126 --> 01:33:35,197
Go, go, go, go, go with Darla.
Good job, Darla!

1585
01:33:35,263 --> 01:33:36,478
Go, go, go, go!

1586
01:33:36,541 --> 01:33:37,565
Kids?

1587
01:33:38,843 --> 01:33:40,065
Why is this open?

1588
01:33:40,244 --> 01:33:41,530
Freddy?

1589
01:33:41,880 --> 01:33:42,895
Mary?

1590
01:33:47,865 --> 01:33:49,460
Freddy, Freddy, keep up.

1591
01:33:49,678 --> 01:33:50,900
Darla, stay in front.

1592
01:33:51,806 --> 01:33:52,909
We gotta hurry.

1593
01:34:16,684 --> 01:34:18,152
- Whoa.
- Whoa.

1594
01:34:18,995 --> 01:34:20,710
So many doors.

1595
01:34:21,466 --> 01:34:23,951
One of these has to be
a way out, right?

1596
01:34:24,120 --> 01:34:25,548
Yeah, I would hope so.

1597
01:34:42,591 --> 01:34:43,781
Not this one.

1598
01:34:57,348 --> 01:34:58,475
Okay, no more doors.

1599
01:34:58,500 --> 01:34:59,795
Nobody open any more doors.

1600
01:34:59,820 --> 01:35:01,747
Come on, Billy,
what are we gonna do?

1601
01:35:01,813 --> 01:35:02,877
Darla, I don't know.

1602
01:35:02,924 --> 01:35:04,250
Billy, yes, you do,
 just-just think.

1603
01:35:04,275 --> 01:35:05,497
How'd you get out last time?

1604
01:35:05,522 --> 01:35:06,704
Well, uh, l-last time I
thought about the subway

1605
01:35:06,729 --> 01:35:07,729
and I was on the subway.

1606
01:35:07,754 --> 01:35:09,833
Then Billy, look,
think about the subway.

1607
01:35:09,858 --> 01:35:12,116
Think about any place
except for here, okay?

1608
01:35:34,531 --> 01:35:35,625
Come on, come on, come on.

1609
01:35:35,650 --> 01:35:37,102
Why are you covering my eyes?

1610
01:35:37,493 --> 01:35:40,201
Really? This is the first place
you think of? Wow!

1611
01:35:40,226 --> 01:35:41,337
You're welcome.

1612
01:35:41,362 --> 01:35:42,962
Why can't I see what's inside?

1613
01:35:43,034 --> 01:35:44,494
You are not old enough.

1614
01:35:44,591 --> 01:35:46,893
Old enough to know
that was great music.

1615
01:35:47,172 --> 01:35:48,258
Not my thing.

1616
01:35:48,282 --> 01:35:49,450
Where's Freddy?

1617
01:35:49,475 --> 01:35:50,801
Yeah, you too, Sriracha, hey,

1618
01:35:50,826 --> 01:35:52,437
have a holly, jolly Christmas.

1619
01:35:52,582 --> 01:35:53,900
Freddy, what are you doing?

1620
01:35:53,950 --> 01:35:55,545
Ah, it's nice people.

1621
01:35:55,601 --> 01:35:56,966
- Nice pe...? Come on.
- Is that glitter?

1622
01:35:56,991 --> 01:35:58,546
They have glitter.
Can I get glitter?

1623
01:35:58,571 --> 01:36:00,396
- No, not from them.
- Please?

1624
01:36:09,814 --> 01:36:11,298
Go, go, go, go!
Everybody go!

1625
01:36:11,716 --> 01:36:12,994
Freddy, Freddy, Freddy.

1626
01:36:13,090 --> 01:36:14,757
One, two, three,
hold onto me.

1627
01:36:23,159 --> 01:36:24,871
Carnival. Go, go, go.
Mary, go.

1628
01:36:24,910 --> 01:36:26,045
Go. Come on, Pedro.

1629
01:36:26,070 --> 01:36:27,087
Come on.

1630
01:36:39,059 --> 01:36:40,729
Walk, just be cool,
act naturally,

1631
01:36:40,754 --> 01:36:42,936
like kids naturally act
in a carnival.

1632
01:36:43,059 --> 01:36:44,432
- He's not gonna look for you...
- Is that him?

1633
01:36:44,488 --> 01:36:45,813
Oh, my God, guys.

1634
01:36:46,110 --> 01:36:47,141
Hey, Powerboy.

1635
01:36:47,166 --> 01:36:48,187
He's an impersonator, okay?

1636
01:36:48,212 --> 01:36:50,149
I'm an impersonator.
I'm a fake version of myself.

1637
01:36:50,174 --> 01:36:51,380
Don't take pictures...

1638
01:36:53,255 --> 01:36:54,446
Shazam!

1639
01:37:01,720 --> 01:37:02,910
Hey, where'd he go?

1640
01:37:11,596 --> 01:37:14,310
Oh, man, oh, man,
I just spit on a baby!

1641
01:37:16,006 --> 01:37:17,474
Yo, what is that?

1642
01:37:23,250 --> 01:37:24,726
Champion!

1643
01:37:27,668 --> 01:37:29,486
You don't deserve that name.

1644
01:37:33,890 --> 01:37:37,414
Hiding behind innocent people
who will now die.

1645
01:37:39,198 --> 01:37:43,523
Because deep down, you're
still just a scared, little boy.

1646
01:37:45,275 --> 01:37:46,942
Oh, no.

1647
01:37:47,910 --> 01:37:49,326
Run!

1648
01:37:49,723 --> 01:37:50,921
Run!

1649
01:38:04,316 --> 01:38:06,181
- What do we do? What do we do?
- Hold on!

1650
01:38:06,233 --> 01:38:07,955
- To what?
- The bar, you idiot!

1651
01:38:16,909 --> 01:38:18,679
Well, you wanted me to be a hero.

1652
01:38:18,958 --> 01:38:20,040
Are you kidding?

1653
01:38:20,190 --> 01:38:21,341
Okay, no. Old guy's up there

1654
01:38:21,366 --> 01:38:23,113
harboring multiple
spiritual entities,

1655
01:38:23,258 --> 01:38:24,703
plus, I mean, he has
the same powers as you,

1656
01:38:24,743 --> 01:38:27,062
plus, you know, a-and
he knows what he's doing,

1657
01:38:27,117 --> 01:38:29,363
plus, you're my best friend,
I don't want you to die.

1658
01:38:30,837 --> 01:38:33,076
If a superhero
can't save his family,

1659
01:38:34,500 --> 01:38:35,881
he's not much of a hero.

1660
01:38:40,276 --> 01:38:41,815
That was a decent catchphrase.

1661
01:38:42,722 --> 01:38:43,857
Shazam!

1662
01:38:52,844 --> 01:38:54,630
Now let's try this again.

1663
01:39:08,880 --> 01:39:10,563
Or try that again.

1664
01:39:18,457 --> 01:39:19,957
Billy, look out!

1665
01:39:22,466 --> 01:39:23,578
Laser eyes?

1666
01:39:23,673 --> 01:39:25,006
Guys, he's got laser eyes!

1667
01:39:25,064 --> 01:39:27,199
Too bad your aim sucks balls!

1668
01:39:37,035 --> 01:39:38,194
His power matrix.

1669
01:39:38,345 --> 01:39:39,527
His what what?

1670
01:39:39,649 --> 01:39:42,093
When the demon guys leave
his eye, he loses his powers.

1671
01:39:43,057 --> 01:39:44,668
That's why the
batarang hurt him.

1672
01:39:45,989 --> 01:39:48,465
Hey, over here!

1673
01:39:49,088 --> 01:39:50,089
W-What are you doing?

1674
01:39:50,114 --> 01:39:51,160
Trust me. Divide and conquer.

1675
01:39:51,185 --> 01:39:53,533
We separate the sins from the
eye, and he's just an old man.

1676
01:39:53,934 --> 01:39:55,371
Gather the mutts.

1677
01:40:33,398 --> 01:40:36,200
Here, take it.
Take it, it's for you.

1678
01:40:37,078 --> 01:40:38,237
Hold it tight.

1679
01:40:38,792 --> 01:40:40,046
Close your eyes.

1680
01:40:40,837 --> 01:40:43,011
Everything's gonna be okay.
Okay?

1681
01:40:44,190 --> 01:40:45,262
Okay.

1682
01:41:08,806 --> 01:41:09,846
Get up.

1683
01:41:25,725 --> 01:41:26,757
Shazam!

1684
01:41:55,543 --> 01:41:57,139
Playtime's over, boy.

1685
01:41:58,364 --> 01:42:00,086
Your friends can't
help you anymore.

1686
01:42:05,839 --> 01:42:06,870
Hey!

1687
01:42:33,579 --> 01:42:34,785
Shazam!

1688
01:42:59,559 --> 01:43:00,638
Nice trick.

1689
01:43:01,122 --> 01:43:02,265
Catchy.

1690
01:43:02,773 --> 01:43:04,384
One simple word.

1691
01:43:05,195 --> 01:43:06,584
I have a better trick.

1692
01:43:07,578 --> 01:43:08,721
Four words.

1693
01:43:10,133 --> 01:43:11,553
Kill the little girl.

1694
01:43:12,692 --> 01:43:14,129
- No, please!
- No!

1695
01:43:17,745 --> 01:43:19,110
Stop!

1696
01:43:34,511 --> 01:43:37,654
Billy, there's one more
demon guy in his eye!

1697
01:43:37,712 --> 01:43:39,378
You gotta just
rip it out of his face...

1698
01:43:39,699 --> 01:43:41,191
It's where he gets his power.

1699
01:43:45,395 --> 01:43:46,593
Reach for it.

1700
01:43:48,379 --> 01:43:49,672
I dare you.

1701
01:43:58,408 --> 01:43:59,655
Wise decision.

1702
01:44:02,075 --> 01:44:03,551
Hands on the staff.

1703
01:44:04,915 --> 01:44:06,407
Billy, don't do this. Billy!

1704
01:44:06,544 --> 01:44:08,457
- Billy!
- Don't do it, Billy!

1705
01:44:28,277 --> 01:44:29,547
Say my name

1706
01:44:29,572 --> 01:44:32,111
so my power may
flow through you.

1707
01:44:32,298 --> 01:44:35,195
I open my heart to you,
Billy Batson.

1708
01:44:35,347 --> 01:44:36,934
And in so doing,

1709
01:44:36,959 --> 01:44:39,601
choose you as champion.

1710
01:44:39,941 --> 01:44:43,671
With your heart,
unlock your greatest power.

1711
01:44:43,778 --> 01:44:46,477
The thrones of our
brothers and sisters await!

1712
01:44:54,646 --> 01:44:56,114
All hands on deck.

1713
01:45:01,439 --> 01:45:02,511
Say my name.

1714
01:45:03,931 --> 01:45:05,106
Billy!

1715
01:45:05,355 --> 01:45:06,434
No, not my name. No.

1716
01:45:06,459 --> 01:45:08,696
Say the name that I say
to turn into this guy.

1717
01:45:09,559 --> 01:45:10,860
Shazam!

1718
01:45:49,253 --> 01:45:50,571
Guys.

1719
01:45:51,988 --> 01:45:53,369
What's happening?

1720
01:45:57,784 --> 01:45:59,260
I can fly!

1721
01:46:03,936 --> 01:46:05,095
Guys.

1722
01:46:05,349 --> 01:46:06,889
Check out these guns.

1723
01:46:08,274 --> 01:46:09,504
No.

1724
01:46:10,481 --> 01:46:12,061
It's not possible!

1725
01:46:13,997 --> 01:46:16,434
Gee whiz, mister.
Sorry I took your game.

1726
01:46:16,507 --> 01:46:18,285
You want it back?

1727
01:46:20,164 --> 01:46:22,259
Guys, I don't believe in violence,

1728
01:46:22,348 --> 01:46:25,689
but I think we should kick this
guy's butt, like, really hard.

1729
01:46:37,162 --> 01:46:38,694
Guys, I think
I can move really

1730
01:46:39,829 --> 01:46:40,884
fast.

1731
01:46:41,333 --> 01:46:42,570
Hyperspeed!

1732
01:46:42,602 --> 01:46:43,722
Check!

1733
01:46:52,447 --> 01:46:53,638
Billy!

1734
01:46:53,828 --> 01:46:54,995
The eye.

1735
01:47:02,336 --> 01:47:03,471
Look out!

1736
01:47:05,627 --> 01:47:06,746
Whoa!

1737
01:47:08,297 --> 01:47:09,297
What?

1738
01:47:13,254 --> 01:47:14,659
You almost exploded me!

1739
01:48:00,915 --> 01:48:02,870
Dude, I've studied
the fighting techniques

1740
01:48:02,895 --> 01:48:04,431
of every single superhero.

1741
01:48:05,822 --> 01:48:07,100
What do you got?

1742
01:48:10,806 --> 01:48:12,242
Well, that's terrifying.

1743
01:48:46,379 --> 01:48:48,585
Enough games, boy.

1744
01:48:49,415 --> 01:48:51,177
You think a pack of children can...

1745
01:48:54,244 --> 01:48:55,284
Wait, what?!

1746
01:48:55,403 --> 01:48:57,835
You will beg for mercy

1747
01:48:57,923 --> 01:48:59,860
as I feast on your heart.

1748
01:49:00,816 --> 01:49:01,888
Slow...

1749
01:49:03,342 --> 01:49:05,437
Are you making
some big, evil guy

1750
01:49:05,462 --> 01:49:07,024
speech right now or something?

1751
01:49:07,049 --> 01:49:09,346
You're like, a mile
away from me right now.

1752
01:49:09,371 --> 01:49:10,683
There's cars and trucks...

1753
01:49:10,708 --> 01:49:13,477
I will have the world eating
out of the palm of my hand...

1754
01:49:13,565 --> 01:49:16,168
All I see is mouth moving.
I don't hear any...

1755
01:49:16,201 --> 01:49:17,948
Only I

1756
01:49:18,019 --> 01:49:20,071
have the power to unleash...

1757
01:49:21,425 --> 01:49:22,600
Oh, whatever, screw it.

1758
01:49:53,751 --> 01:49:55,076
Oh, my gosh, those people!

1759
01:50:03,116 --> 01:50:04,204
Hi!

1760
01:50:04,942 --> 01:50:06,165
I caught you!

1761
01:50:17,276 --> 01:50:18,292
I got it!

1762
01:50:18,967 --> 01:50:19,983
I got it!

1763
01:50:25,950 --> 01:50:27,474
Oh, my God, I do got it.

1764
01:50:43,980 --> 01:50:45,376
You're not gonna believe this,

1765
01:50:45,401 --> 01:50:47,194
but you're actually the
first villain I've ever fought.

1766
01:50:47,221 --> 01:50:49,293
It's, like, kind of
a huge deal for me.

1767
01:51:04,332 --> 01:51:05,760
Somebody help!

1768
01:51:14,712 --> 01:51:15,958
Hadouken!

1769
01:51:20,391 --> 01:51:21,391
Hi!

1770
01:51:21,416 --> 01:51:22,844
Wow, it's really you.

1771
01:51:23,811 --> 01:51:26,586
My name is Darla
and I've been really good!

1772
01:51:26,938 --> 01:51:27,966
What?

1773
01:51:31,673 --> 01:51:33,126
Oh, crap.

1774
01:51:34,643 --> 01:51:36,286
No, no, no, no.
No, no!

1775
01:52:04,317 --> 01:52:05,357
Oh, my God!

1776
01:52:05,382 --> 01:52:06,952
I'm giving you suitcase wedgies!

1777
01:52:44,114 --> 01:52:46,352
So this is about your
Seven Deadly Sins, right?

1778
01:52:47,220 --> 01:52:49,506
I mean, I've never been
great at math, but uh...

1779
01:52:49,842 --> 01:52:52,229
The big, angry one,
that's Wrath, yeah?

1780
01:52:52,614 --> 01:52:54,892
And then Gluttony, obvi.

1781
01:52:55,665 --> 01:52:56,745
Pride.

1782
01:52:57,199 --> 01:52:59,690
Greed and Sloth, Lust, who

1783
01:52:59,741 --> 01:53:02,916
I thought was gonna be
way hotter, if I'm being honest.

1784
01:53:03,302 --> 01:53:06,215
But that's only six. Where's...
Where's lucky number seven?

1785
01:53:06,588 --> 01:53:08,508
Where's little man?
Where's Envy?

1786
01:53:08,711 --> 01:53:11,559
Is he just scared of me and my
family 'cause we're so awesome?

1787
01:53:11,584 --> 01:53:12,916
'Cause I get that.

1788
01:53:13,103 --> 01:53:15,254
Like, the other sins, they
get to come out and fight

1789
01:53:15,460 --> 01:53:17,111
'cause they're big
and strong and scary.

1790
01:53:17,410 --> 01:53:18,671
But Envy,

1791
01:53:19,735 --> 01:53:21,171
he's just a runt.

1792
01:53:33,761 --> 01:53:35,087
And that's why
all the other sins

1793
01:53:35,112 --> 01:53:37,087
never invite him
out to play, man.

1794
01:53:37,181 --> 01:53:38,737
'Cause they all know who'd win.

1795
01:53:39,742 --> 01:53:40,952
And it's not weak,

1796
01:53:40,996 --> 01:53:43,524
worthless, ugly

1797
01:53:43,627 --> 01:53:44,941
Envy.

1798
01:53:49,836 --> 01:53:51,829
No!

1799
01:54:11,033 --> 01:54:12,184
Gotcha.

1800
01:54:12,985 --> 01:54:14,183
Shazam!

1801
01:54:21,445 --> 01:54:22,493
Shazam!

1802
01:54:33,174 --> 01:54:34,920
Ready to go
round up your buddies?

1803
01:55:04,152 --> 01:55:05,382
No.

1804
01:55:06,202 --> 01:55:07,249
No!

1805
01:55:37,192 --> 01:55:39,041
Here's the thing about power.

1806
01:55:39,703 --> 01:55:41,282
What good's power

1807
01:55:41,353 --> 01:55:43,290
if you got nobody
to share it with?

1808
01:55:44,982 --> 01:55:46,704
- Nice.
- Ta-da.

1809
01:55:46,729 --> 01:55:47,878
That's disgusting.

1810
01:55:47,903 --> 01:55:49,117
Fatality.

1811
01:55:50,580 --> 01:55:51,714
I got the voice.

1812
01:55:55,497 --> 01:55:56,775
What's that?

1813
01:56:02,299 --> 01:56:04,220
I can have anything
I've ever wanted?

1814
01:56:08,027 --> 01:56:09,224
Billy, no.

1815
01:56:09,281 --> 01:56:10,701
No, no, no, no!

1816
01:56:16,790 --> 01:56:18,370
- You should hear yourself.
- That's not funny.

1817
01:56:18,427 --> 01:56:20,580
What, you think I'm gonna
put a demon ball in my head?

1818
01:56:20,633 --> 01:56:21,831
That's disgusting.

1819
01:56:21,898 --> 01:56:23,700
- It's not funny.
- Pretty funny. You got me going.

1820
01:56:23,725 --> 01:56:25,709
Uh, guys, guys.

1821
01:56:28,819 --> 01:56:29,938
What?

1822
01:56:31,488 --> 01:56:33,068
Oh, hey.

1823
01:56:33,298 --> 01:56:34,433
Oh, wow.

1824
01:56:36,968 --> 01:56:38,308
- Oh.
- Oh.

1825
01:56:43,637 --> 01:56:45,073
All right, we did it!

1826
01:56:45,416 --> 01:56:47,122
- Whoo!
- All right! Yeah!

1827
01:56:47,898 --> 01:56:48,985
Thank you!

1828
01:56:50,259 --> 01:56:51,624
We did it!

1829
01:56:52,945 --> 01:56:55,667
Yeah, you guys are all safe.
There's no more danger.

1830
01:57:09,700 --> 01:57:11,375
You sure this is gonna work?

1831
01:57:13,030 --> 01:57:14,276
Told ya.

1832
01:57:33,359 --> 01:57:35,320
You guys know
what this place is, right?

1833
01:57:35,411 --> 01:57:37,816
A dark, haunted cave
with demon statues.

1834
01:57:38,095 --> 01:57:40,976
Well, yes, but also...

1835
01:57:43,832 --> 01:57:44,943
Lair!

1836
01:57:45,133 --> 01:57:46,593
We got a lair!

1837
01:57:46,765 --> 01:57:47,956
Lair.

1838
01:57:48,622 --> 01:57:50,448
- Lair.
- We got a lair.

1839
01:57:52,755 --> 01:57:54,160
What's a lair?

1840
01:57:54,737 --> 01:57:56,642
And thanks to six superheroes,

1841
01:57:56,713 --> 01:57:58,546
citizens are back in their homes

1842
01:57:58,628 --> 01:58:00,462
safe again with their families.

1843
01:58:00,764 --> 01:58:03,264
And here with an eyewitness
account of the events...

1844
01:58:03,306 --> 01:58:05,568
It was f***ing crazy, man!

1845
01:58:05,729 --> 01:58:07,848
Creatures from f***ing hell!

1846
01:58:07,906 --> 01:58:10,541
Lightning coming out of
everyone's f***ing everything.

1847
01:58:10,672 --> 01:58:13,069
And that is not f***ing cool, man!

1848
01:58:13,906 --> 01:58:15,192
I'm tired of it.

1849
01:58:17,804 --> 01:58:18,982
<i>♪ This will be ♪</i>

1850
01:58:19,813 --> 01:58:21,163
<i>♪ An everlasting love ♪</i>

1851
01:58:22,705 --> 01:58:23,840
Guys,

1852
01:58:24,205 --> 01:58:25,578
all hands on deck.

1853
01:58:25,604 --> 01:58:26,604
Oh!

1854
01:58:28,704 --> 01:58:30,061
W-W-W-Wait!

1855
01:58:30,124 --> 01:58:31,156
Wait.

1856
01:58:31,580 --> 01:58:33,103
Thank you for this food.

1857
01:58:33,357 --> 01:58:34,865
Thank you for this day.

1858
01:58:35,341 --> 01:58:36,770
Thank you for this family.

1859
01:58:37,556 --> 01:58:40,011
I thought maybe
this time I'd stay.

1860
01:58:41,024 --> 01:58:43,636
I mean, after all,

1861
01:58:43,691 --> 01:58:45,086
I'm home.

1862
01:59:22,139 --> 01:59:23,140
Nope.

1863
01:59:25,541 --> 01:59:26,613
Okay.

1864
01:59:29,960 --> 01:59:31,209
What are you doin'?

1865
01:59:31,658 --> 01:59:33,963
Waiting for your
imaginary BFF to show up?

1866
01:59:43,577 --> 01:59:44,768
What are you guys doing here?

1867
01:59:44,974 --> 01:59:46,482
Well, we're having lunch with you.

1868
01:59:46,665 --> 01:59:48,347
But you guys have
different lunch periods.

1869
01:59:48,437 --> 01:59:50,706
Well, we made a very
special arrangement.

1870
01:59:51,790 --> 01:59:53,345
Darla, what's going on?

1871
01:59:53,416 --> 01:59:54,877
Why are you asking me?

1872
01:59:55,237 --> 01:59:56,674
Freddy Freeman!

1873
01:59:58,658 --> 02:00:00,419
This guy...

1874
02:00:00,451 --> 02:00:03,580
taught me everything I know
about being a dope superhero.

1875
02:00:03,605 --> 02:00:05,909
True story, you should
get some pointers

1876
02:00:05,934 --> 02:00:08,053
from him. What's goin' on,

1877
02:00:08,082 --> 02:00:10,883
my best bud...
in the whole world?

1878
02:00:10,938 --> 02:00:14,160
And also new kids that I'm
meeting for the first time

1879
02:00:14,185 --> 02:00:15,742
but seem very cool?

1880
02:00:15,767 --> 02:00:16,801
Uh... huh,

1881
02:00:16,826 --> 02:00:19,598
I invited another friend,
I hope that's okay.

1882
02:00:26,428 --> 02:00:27,507
Huh!
