1
00:00:04,130 --> 00:00:07,213
(gentle piano music)

2
00:00:39,385 --> 00:00:42,135
(music swelling)

3
00:01:27,910 --> 00:01:31,260
- Ah, this is a beautiful
place for our wedding.

4
00:01:32,610 --> 00:01:34,010
- Only the best for my baby.

5
00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:40,170
- Welcome to the...

6
00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:41,230
nice scarf.

7
00:01:41,230 --> 00:01:42,150
- Thank you.

8
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:43,843
So key's inside, luggage is in the back.

9
00:01:43,843 --> 00:01:46,200
- I don't do luggage,
I just drive the car.

10
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:47,033
- Okay.

11
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:50,010
- There's a tip jar inside.

12
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:56,016
- Guess we're doing this.

13
00:01:56,016 --> 00:01:56,849
- I guess so.

14
00:01:59,977 --> 00:02:02,703
- Whoah, hey, just give us a moment, okay?

15
00:02:10,739 --> 00:02:13,420
- You know, my dad's gonna
be more excited to see you

16
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:14,890
than I think he is to see me.

17
00:02:14,890 --> 00:02:17,070
- Yeah, he knows you're
going to get looked after.

18
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:18,760
Hey, please don't smoke in my car, okay?

19
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:20,047
- I can smell it.

20
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:24,923
- I'll be right back.

21
00:02:24,923 --> 00:02:26,355
- Okay.

22
00:02:26,355 --> 00:02:27,394
- Hey!
- Hey!

23
00:02:27,394 --> 00:02:28,269
How are you?

24
00:02:28,269 --> 00:02:29,970
- I'm good, how are you?

25
00:02:29,970 --> 00:02:31,430
- I'm good.

26
00:02:31,430 --> 00:02:32,420
Yeah.
- Good to see you.

27
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:33,253
- [Dimple] You want a hand?

28
00:02:33,253 --> 00:02:35,213
- [Charlee] Yeah, please, thank you.

29
00:02:36,629 --> 00:02:37,513
- [Dimple] What do you got in here?

30
00:02:37,513 --> 00:02:40,735
- [Charlee] Wedding supplies.

31
00:02:40,735 --> 00:02:42,862
- [Dimple] Allow me.

32
00:02:42,862 --> 00:02:44,695
- [Charlee] Thank you.

33
00:02:45,858 --> 00:02:48,775
(clubs clattering)

34
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,090
- Geez, babe.
- Ooh.

35
00:02:58,090 --> 00:03:00,700
- On behalf of the Royal
Tyler, I welcome you.

36
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:02,400
Refreshments are at the bar.

37
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:03,860
Driving range is out back.

38
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:06,180
And sporting clays are down the path.

39
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:08,210
Tonight's dinner, 6:00 PM.

40
00:03:08,210 --> 00:03:09,730
Tomorrow's the big day.

41
00:03:09,730 --> 00:03:13,053
Wedding service, 2:00 PM, sharp.

42
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:14,793
- Sporting clays?

43
00:03:14,793 --> 00:03:16,020
- Yeah we're going to go shooting.

44
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:17,160
- Ooh.

45
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:18,503
- They do shooting here?

46
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:21,320
Ugh, great.

47
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:22,916
Guns and hillbillies.

48
00:03:22,916 --> 00:03:25,666
(Charlee laughs)

49
00:03:35,650 --> 00:03:39,724
- Time for drinks! (chuckling)

50
00:03:39,724 --> 00:03:42,605
Get your drink on, get your drink on,

51
00:03:42,605 --> 00:03:45,163
get your drink on, get your drink on...

52
00:03:45,163 --> 00:03:48,496
(fast-paced rock music)

53
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:51,797
(cat mewing)

54
00:03:57,250 --> 00:03:58,133
- Sorry baby.

55
00:03:59,511 --> 00:04:00,344
You're gonna have to wait one more night

56
00:04:00,344 --> 00:04:01,620
till you get all of this.

57
00:04:02,630 --> 00:04:05,253
- Oh dear, what's a girl to do?

58
00:04:06,170 --> 00:04:07,023
- I don't know.

59
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:10,533
- Well, at least I have my wine.

60
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:19,260
You know, I think I'm
actually gonna go out

61
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:21,030
and practice my golf swing.

62
00:04:21,030 --> 00:04:23,500
Explore the grounds, you know?

63
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:24,480
- Yeah.

64
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:25,370
Yeah, good idea.

65
00:04:25,370 --> 00:04:27,220
Sorry, I got so much work
to do with this publisher.

66
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:29,450
He's like demanding so
much of me right now.

67
00:04:29,450 --> 00:04:30,460
- [Maria] Yeah.

68
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:31,323
No, I get it.

69
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:33,480
I'll see you later.

70
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:34,313
- Okay.

71
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:38,890
(playful guitar music)

72
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:43,254
- Hey!
- Hey!

73
00:04:43,254 --> 00:04:45,260
Hi!
- Hi!

74
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:46,755
- How is everything?

75
00:04:46,755 --> 00:04:47,840
- Look at you.

76
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:48,673
- Where's your guitar?

77
00:04:48,673 --> 00:04:50,490
Did you finally give up on music?

78
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:51,440
- Not yet.

79
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:53,510
I wish I could do anything else.

80
00:04:53,510 --> 00:04:55,470
- Well, I'm doing great.

81
00:04:55,470 --> 00:04:57,950
Maria hooked me up with this huge account.

82
00:04:57,950 --> 00:05:00,257
- Ooh, that's awesome.

83
00:05:00,257 --> 00:05:02,210
You still try to marry every guy you date?

84
00:05:02,210 --> 00:05:04,460
- At least I can find a guy.

85
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:07,270
- Yeah, I just don't believe
in love at first sight.

86
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:08,330
- Yeah.

87
00:05:08,330 --> 00:05:09,324
- [Maria] Hey.

88
00:05:09,324 --> 00:05:10,241
- Hey!
- Oh!

89
00:05:12,910 --> 00:05:15,207
- Oh girls, you guys look so good.

90
00:05:15,207 --> 00:05:18,467
Okay, hold on let me
put this big bag down.

91
00:05:18,467 --> 00:05:21,090
It's really good to see you guys.

92
00:05:21,090 --> 00:05:22,240
- It's too bad it takes a wedding

93
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:23,813
for us to all get in the same room.

94
00:05:23,813 --> 00:05:25,810
- I know, I agree.

95
00:05:25,810 --> 00:05:28,080
Jenny, where's your guitar?

96
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:30,140
- Wow, am I just completely disappointing

97
00:05:30,140 --> 00:05:33,170
without it? (laughs)

98
00:05:33,170 --> 00:05:34,410
It's in the car.

99
00:05:34,410 --> 00:05:36,340
You know, if I play, you're
going to have to sing.

100
00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:37,460
- Oh no, no, no, no, no.

101
00:05:37,460 --> 00:05:40,640
I don't do that anymore, I
am strictly a shower singer.

102
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:42,620
- Mhmm, and she'll still be better at it

103
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:43,820
than the rest of us.

104
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:45,100
(girls laugh)

105
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:47,143
- Girls, I'm really happy you came out.

106
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:50,480
It's my big day.

107
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:52,790
And it means a lot that
you're sharing it with me.

108
00:05:52,790 --> 00:05:54,593
So, thank you.

109
00:05:55,610 --> 00:05:58,620
Anyways, I got to go
practice, learn, whatever,

110
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:00,320
perfect my golf skills.

111
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:01,970
So, I will see you later.

112
00:06:01,970 --> 00:06:04,330
- [Jenny] Oh, good luck with that.

113
00:06:04,330 --> 00:06:06,140
- Grab some wine on your way out.

114
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:07,190
I think you're going to need it.

115
00:06:07,190 --> 00:06:09,454
- I like the way you think, girl.

116
00:06:09,454 --> 00:06:10,287
Bye.

117
00:06:10,287 --> 00:06:12,120
- Bye, love you.
- Bye.

118
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:18,560
- Can you believe she's
going to marry Dimple?

119
00:06:19,636 --> 00:06:24,636
- I don't want to.

120
00:06:31,589 --> 00:06:36,589
(suspenseful music)
(car revving)

121
00:06:59,968 --> 00:07:04,180
- Oh!
(body thudding)

122
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:05,013
- Oh no.

123
00:07:10,981 --> 00:07:12,800
What happened?

124
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,377
Let me, let me, let me.

125
00:07:17,582 --> 00:07:20,711
- (laughs) What's so funny?

126
00:07:20,711 --> 00:07:22,862
- You slipped on a banana peel.

127
00:07:22,862 --> 00:07:25,510
(Maria laughs)

128
00:07:25,510 --> 00:07:27,760
How did you manage that?

129
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:28,593
- I don't know.

130
00:07:28,593 --> 00:07:30,770
- That's not supposed
to happen in real life.

131
00:07:31,606 --> 00:07:33,120
And what are these golf clubs for?

132
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:35,340
- They're for my work,
so give them back, okay?

133
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:36,803
- I wish I had your job.

134
00:07:38,247 --> 00:07:39,200
- Do you play?

135
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:41,560
- Oh, I'm terrible.

136
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:43,082
- Me too.

137
00:07:43,082 --> 00:07:46,415
(fast-paced rock music)

138
00:07:54,155 --> 00:07:55,160
- Hey!

139
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:56,794
They told me you were out here.

140
00:07:56,794 --> 00:07:58,170
- You made it!

141
00:07:58,170 --> 00:08:00,573
God, it's so good to see you.

142
00:08:00,573 --> 00:08:01,695
Have a seat.

143
00:08:01,695 --> 00:08:04,010
- All right. (clears throat)

144
00:08:04,010 --> 00:08:05,423
- How's dad?

145
00:08:05,423 --> 00:08:06,400
Have you seen him yet?

146
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:07,330
- Not yet.

147
00:08:07,330 --> 00:08:09,467
I'm headed there after this.

148
00:08:09,467 --> 00:08:10,790
- Well, it was nice for you to stop by

149
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:11,623
and help us out first.

150
00:08:11,623 --> 00:08:14,340
- Of course, I couldn't be
in the area and not see you.

151
00:08:15,950 --> 00:08:17,460
- So how long you home for?

152
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:19,060
- Just a few weeks.

153
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:20,670
I'm headed to D.C. at
the end of the month,

154
00:08:20,670 --> 00:08:22,411
to lobby at the VA there.

155
00:08:22,411 --> 00:08:25,427
- Well it's good you're getting
some political experience.

156
00:08:25,427 --> 00:08:28,120
Who knows, maybe that's
what's next for you.

157
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:29,420
- I don't know about that.

158
00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:34,699
I was thinking about doing another tour.

159
00:08:34,699 --> 00:08:35,990
- What?

160
00:08:35,990 --> 00:08:36,823
Why?

161
00:08:38,340 --> 00:08:40,590
Aren't you ready to
settle down with someone?

162
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:45,120
- I haven't really thought about it

163
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:47,632
and I haven't found the right person yet.

164
00:08:47,632 --> 00:08:49,230
But enough about me.

165
00:08:49,230 --> 00:08:50,410
What about you?

166
00:08:50,410 --> 00:08:52,260
Where's your knight in shining armor?

167
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:54,483
- Well, I met someone.

168
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:58,860
But it's complicated.

169
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:00,880
- That doesn't sound reassuring.

170
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:01,750
- No, he's great.

171
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:02,743
It's just,

172
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:07,270
he's got a lot going on.

173
00:09:07,270 --> 00:09:09,230
- Well, whatever it is,

174
00:09:09,230 --> 00:09:11,258
I hope he's better than the last guy.

175
00:09:11,258 --> 00:09:12,380
- Hey now!

176
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:14,790
(both laughing)

177
00:09:14,790 --> 00:09:16,220
- I just want you to be happy is all.

178
00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:17,970
- Okay, dad.

179
00:09:17,970 --> 00:09:20,763
- Hey Charlee, have you
seen the napkin rings?

180
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:23,580
Hi.

181
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:25,813
- [Charlee] I think I know where they are.

182
00:09:26,790 --> 00:09:28,253
But this is my brother Henry.

183
00:09:29,658 --> 00:09:31,040
- Charlee, I knew you had a brother,

184
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:33,730
but this is not what I was expecting.

185
00:09:33,730 --> 00:09:35,700
- He's handsome, right?

186
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:39,120
He stopped by to help us out
first, before he takes off.

187
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,347
- So, you're not gonna stay?

188
00:09:41,347 --> 00:09:44,340
- I don't want to crash your wedding, and

189
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:47,250
besides, I have a colleague with me.

190
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:49,820
- Nonsense, he can be your plus one.

191
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:51,850
- Oh, he's a good time too.

192
00:09:51,850 --> 00:09:53,400
The other guy, not Henry.

193
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:56,210
He's a stick in the mud. (laughs)

194
00:09:56,210 --> 00:09:58,430
But I love him with all my heart.

195
00:09:58,430 --> 00:09:59,613
- Thanks, sis.

196
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:02,641
- I'm gonna go find those napkin rings.

197
00:10:02,641 --> 00:10:03,474
- Okay, great, thank you.

198
00:10:03,474 --> 00:10:04,307
- I'll see you two later.

199
00:10:04,307 --> 00:10:05,317
- Bye, sis.

200
00:10:05,317 --> 00:10:06,650
- [Charlee] Bye.

201
00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:13,853
- So, you're going to stay?

202
00:10:14,950 --> 00:10:15,853
- Yeah, why not?

203
00:10:19,590 --> 00:10:21,050
- Good.

204
00:10:21,050 --> 00:10:22,000
I'll see you later.

205
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:24,353
- I hope so.

206
00:10:35,685 --> 00:10:38,852
(lightly tense music)

207
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:49,373
- Sir, for the dinner,

208
00:10:50,410 --> 00:10:53,000
we're having trouble running your card.

209
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,200
- How? I made a payment.

210
00:10:55,250 --> 00:10:56,200
I'll write a check.

211
00:10:57,380 --> 00:10:59,280
- [Host] Our policies are very strict.

212
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:01,903
- Use my card on file.

213
00:11:02,930 --> 00:11:07,367
It's the least I can do
for my new son. (chuckling)

214
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:10,410
- Very good, sir.

215
00:11:10,410 --> 00:11:11,340
See you at six.

216
00:11:11,340 --> 00:11:12,472
- Six it is!

217
00:11:12,472 --> 00:11:14,040
Yeah, hmm?

218
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:15,089
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

219
00:11:15,089 --> 00:11:15,922
Anytime.

220
00:11:15,922 --> 00:11:17,260
(both laugh)

221
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:18,093
- Great.

222
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:22,710
(Dimple sighing)

223
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:26,460
That's a awesome suit.

224
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:28,110
You here for our wedding?

225
00:11:28,110 --> 00:11:29,540
- Indirectly.

226
00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:32,564
It's more of a working
holiday, I'm afraid.

227
00:11:32,564 --> 00:11:33,840
- Oh, nice.

228
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:36,570
What line of work you in?

229
00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:38,240
- I help individuals and businesses

230
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:39,780
acquire accounts receivable.

231
00:11:39,780 --> 00:11:41,170
Cheers.

232
00:11:41,170 --> 00:11:42,203
- Excellent niche.

233
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:44,690
You must do well.

234
00:11:44,690 --> 00:11:46,150
- I am ruthless with deadbeats

235
00:11:46,150 --> 00:11:48,790
and my clients are very private people.

236
00:11:48,790 --> 00:11:51,280
- Wow, it sounds like exciting work.

237
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:52,963
How long have you been in America for?

238
00:11:52,963 --> 00:11:54,273
- Just a few days.

239
00:11:55,730 --> 00:11:57,230
- I just got back from Britain.

240
00:11:57,230 --> 00:11:58,063
- Really?

241
00:11:58,063 --> 00:11:58,896
- Yeah.

242
00:11:59,849 --> 00:12:00,810
- How'd you get on?

243
00:12:00,810 --> 00:12:01,770
- Great.

244
00:12:01,770 --> 00:12:04,250
Made a lot of young adoring fans.

245
00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:05,083
- Really?

246
00:12:05,083 --> 00:12:06,880
- Check out my accent.

247
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:08,440
Good day, governor.

248
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:10,660
Fancy a cup of tea?

249
00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:14,410
- That's charming. (chuckling)

250
00:12:14,410 --> 00:12:16,870
You know, I could really use the help

251
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:19,983
from someone who truly
understands Americans.

252
00:12:21,150 --> 00:12:22,660
How would you like a job?

253
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:23,493
- I'd love one.

254
00:12:23,493 --> 00:12:24,326
- Terrific.

255
00:12:24,326 --> 00:12:25,430
- Do you have dinner plans later?

256
00:12:25,430 --> 00:12:26,800
- I don't.

257
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:27,750
- It's settled.

258
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:29,440
6:00 PM, the dining room.

259
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:30,273
Guest of honor.

260
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:33,930
- You really know how to
show a guy a good time.

261
00:12:33,930 --> 00:12:34,763
I like that.

262
00:12:35,710 --> 00:12:38,913
Mr. Von Dumpling, please do excuse me.

263
00:12:40,370 --> 00:12:42,233
I need to go use the dog and bone.

264
00:12:50,589 --> 00:12:51,839
- Dog and bone.

265
00:12:59,290 --> 00:13:01,790
(light music)

266
00:13:06,913 --> 00:13:08,210
En garde, sir!

267
00:13:08,210 --> 00:13:09,043
Yeah!

268
00:13:14,535 --> 00:13:16,599
There you go.

269
00:13:16,599 --> 00:13:19,780
Good as new. (chuckling)

270
00:13:19,780 --> 00:13:22,613
(chimes tinkling)

271
00:13:30,821 --> 00:13:33,571
(birds chirping)

272
00:13:34,641 --> 00:13:37,250
- Are we in the right place?

273
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:38,250
(rock music)
- Yep.

274
00:13:40,910 --> 00:13:41,743
- Okay.

275
00:13:43,978 --> 00:13:45,640
- Should I get you guys some golf balls?

276
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:46,700
- Do you want to go shooting instead?

277
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:47,810
- Yeah, let's try that.

278
00:13:47,810 --> 00:13:49,110
- Where's the shooting range?

279
00:13:49,110 --> 00:13:51,090
- You're standing on it.

280
00:13:51,090 --> 00:13:52,940
- I thought this was the driving range.

281
00:13:52,940 --> 00:13:54,260
- You're standing on that too.

282
00:13:54,260 --> 00:13:56,876
- Wait the guy, the host, he said that

283
00:13:56,876 --> 00:13:59,200
there's a path to get to the driving range

284
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:01,760
and then in the back,
there's another range.

285
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:03,940
- Yeah, you take the
path to get to the back.

286
00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:06,043
Do not believe that guy, he's full of it.

287
00:14:08,390 --> 00:14:09,690
- Let's go shoot then.

288
00:14:09,690 --> 00:14:10,770
- Excellent choice.

289
00:14:10,770 --> 00:14:12,120
I'll take the 12 gauge.

290
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:13,470
- 410.

291
00:14:13,470 --> 00:14:14,303
- Okay.

292
00:14:14,303 --> 00:14:15,916
Hope you don't mind waiting.

293
00:14:15,916 --> 00:14:17,666
- I can't believe it.

294
00:14:20,788 --> 00:14:24,121
(fast-paced rock music)

295
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:38,833
Where the heck is he?

296
00:14:38,833 --> 00:14:41,190
- They did not set this place up well.

297
00:14:41,190 --> 00:14:43,193
- He is taking his sweet time.

298
00:14:44,130 --> 00:14:44,970
- [Frank] Right here guys.

299
00:14:44,970 --> 00:14:46,160
- Oh, hey.
- Check it out.

300
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:46,993
- Thank you.

301
00:14:46,993 --> 00:14:47,826
- Exactly what you guys

302
00:14:47,826 --> 00:14:48,814
wanted.
- Nice.

303
00:14:48,814 --> 00:14:50,152
- Do you mind going to
operate the machine?

304
00:14:50,152 --> 00:14:51,276
I'm just going to take a few real quick.

305
00:14:51,276 --> 00:14:52,560
- No, no, no, that's your job.

306
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:53,423
Let me do mine.

307
00:14:55,025 --> 00:14:56,191
- Get out of here.
- Thank you.

308
00:14:56,191 --> 00:14:57,024
Thank you.

309
00:14:57,024 --> 00:14:59,899
- What the heck is his problem?

310
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:00,899
- We'll see.

311
00:15:02,126 --> 00:15:02,959
- Pull!

312
00:15:05,597 --> 00:15:08,264
(rifle booming)

313
00:15:09,530 --> 00:15:10,551
- [Henry] Pull!

314
00:15:10,551 --> 00:15:13,540
(rifle booming)

315
00:15:13,540 --> 00:15:15,203
- You are really bad at this.

316
00:15:16,681 --> 00:15:17,514
- You win.

317
00:15:18,601 --> 00:15:20,451
- You know, winning isn't everything.

318
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:22,653
- Oh really?

319
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:27,417
- No, I love to win,
let's go again. (laughs)

320
00:15:27,417 --> 00:15:29,170
- [Henry] You know,

321
00:15:29,170 --> 00:15:30,618
it's so nice.
- I know,

322
00:15:30,618 --> 00:15:31,570
and then he changes his voice,

323
00:15:31,570 --> 00:15:33,880
he's like I'm tired of asking for this.

324
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:35,239
- Yeah yeah, you know?

325
00:15:35,239 --> 00:15:36,873
- It's hilarious.

326
00:15:36,873 --> 00:15:37,923
- It's weird.

327
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:40,773
I feel like I know you already.

328
00:15:41,860 --> 00:15:43,410
- There you are!

329
00:15:43,410 --> 00:15:45,680
I've been looking for you everywhere.

330
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:47,110
Hey, I'm dying for a drink.

331
00:15:47,110 --> 00:15:49,570
Can we do like a margarita light ice,

332
00:15:49,570 --> 00:15:50,940
just a little bit of salt around the rim,

333
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:51,773
not too much, thank you.

334
00:15:51,773 --> 00:15:53,093
- Wait, I don't work here.

335
00:15:55,540 --> 00:15:56,730
- Oh, Hey.

336
00:15:56,730 --> 00:15:58,400
With the bags,

337
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:00,360
we're staying at the very top, okay?

338
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:02,340
So just put them up right up the top.

339
00:16:02,340 --> 00:16:05,540
Not the second floor,
but the top floor, okay?

340
00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:07,363
The tippy top, you got it?

341
00:16:07,363 --> 00:16:08,260
- Uh-uh.

342
00:16:08,260 --> 00:16:09,740
- Thank you.

343
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:12,200
What a nice guy.
- He doesn't work here.

344
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:13,033
- Oh.

345
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:14,953
Oh.

346
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:17,650
So where's this other guy?

347
00:16:19,372 --> 00:16:22,622
(military flute music)

348
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:28,073
- [Man] Over here, you jarhead.

349
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:31,297
- That's Colonel Jar Head to you.

350
00:16:31,297 --> 00:16:32,790
- Man, what took you?

351
00:16:32,790 --> 00:16:34,130
Did you not read the signs?

352
00:16:34,130 --> 00:16:35,570
- Ain't nothing gets past me.

353
00:16:35,570 --> 00:16:37,383
- So what, you take the wrong path?

354
00:16:40,330 --> 00:16:41,540
What's wrong with your eyes?

355
00:16:41,540 --> 00:16:42,740
- It was the right path.

356
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:46,360
So which room is Charlee Manley's?

357
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:47,530
I'm her brother.

358
00:16:47,530 --> 00:16:48,970
- Thank you for your service, sir.

359
00:16:48,970 --> 00:16:51,123
Room 17, rear left.

360
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,650
Glad to have you here, Colonel.

361
00:16:53,650 --> 00:16:55,390
On the house.

362
00:16:55,390 --> 00:16:57,520
I'm happy to house our servicemen anytime.

- Hey.

370
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:52,560
Thanks for the help, guys.

371
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:54,330
I'm William, William Von Dumpling.

372
00:17:54,330 --> 00:17:55,490
- Oh, you're the groom.

373
00:17:55,490 --> 00:17:57,630
- Yeah, guilty as charged.

374
00:17:57,630 --> 00:17:59,530
Charlee's brother, I get it.

375
00:17:59,530 --> 00:18:01,130
In the service, right?

376
00:18:01,130 --> 00:18:02,170
Yeah.

377
00:18:02,170 --> 00:18:03,920
She talks about you, okay.

378
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:05,170
Nice to finally meet you.

379
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:07,750
And sorry about before.

380
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:08,860
- No problem.

381
00:18:08,860 --> 00:18:11,810
And I thank you for letting
me be a part of your wedding.

382
00:18:11,810 --> 00:18:13,650
And this is my plus one, Nate.

383
00:18:13,650 --> 00:18:14,600
- Howdy.

384
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:15,710
We're together.

385
00:18:15,710 --> 00:18:17,130
- Oh.

386
00:18:17,130 --> 00:18:18,490
- Oh, no.

387
00:18:18,490 --> 00:18:20,763
Not together, together,
not like that together.

388
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:24,230
Speaking of together, who was that girl

389
00:18:24,230 --> 00:18:26,750
that just crossed here with a guitar?

390
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:29,220
- Oh, that's Jenny.

391
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:31,010
She's crazy.

392
00:18:31,010 --> 00:18:32,770
But, she's a great musician.

393
00:18:32,770 --> 00:18:34,240
(door knocking)

394
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:35,773
- No, no, come in.

395
00:18:37,060 --> 00:18:37,893
- Oh.

396
00:18:43,090 --> 00:18:45,330
Can I talk to you for a second?

397
00:18:45,330 --> 00:18:46,493
- Yeah, of course.

398
00:18:51,530 --> 00:18:52,523
- What should I do?

399
00:18:54,070 --> 00:18:56,290
- [Charlee] Follow your heart.

400
00:18:56,290 --> 00:18:59,940
- That would crush my dad, literally.

401
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:01,140
- Who's getting married?

402
00:19:02,380 --> 00:19:06,620
- It's just, why can't I
see the good side of Dimple?

403
00:19:06,620 --> 00:19:07,763
- Yeah, he's awesome.

404
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:12,840
Your family's really this tight?

405
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:14,520
- I would do anything for my dad.

406
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:16,740
I would live in poverty.

407
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:18,620
- That's cool, but...

408
00:19:18,620 --> 00:19:20,183
- I would marry a wimp.

409
00:19:21,230 --> 00:19:22,603
- Well, that is not Dimple.

410
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:27,683
He cares so much for the environment,

411
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:29,953
for everyone.

412
00:19:32,005 --> 00:19:33,040
He'll be fine.

413
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:33,963
- Yeah, he will.

414
00:19:35,633 --> 00:19:36,760
(Dimple sighing)

415
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:38,160
- Lots of foreign cars here.

416
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:42,740
- Yeah, that Beamer's sick.

417
00:19:42,740 --> 00:19:44,070
You have a car like that,

418
00:19:44,070 --> 00:19:46,329
everybody wants a piece of your burrito.

419
00:19:46,329 --> 00:19:48,060
- I'm more of a fajita guy.

420
00:19:48,060 --> 00:19:49,963
- Man, I go crazy for a good chalupa.

421
00:19:51,230 --> 00:19:52,063
How about you?

422
00:19:54,870 --> 00:19:56,030
- Burrito?

423
00:19:56,030 --> 00:19:57,880
- You don't sound so sure about that.

424
00:19:59,130 --> 00:20:01,600
- Well, yeah, it was part
of the joke, you know,

425
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:02,810
with the euphemism of the...

426
00:20:02,810 --> 00:20:04,343
- I know what it's for.

427
00:20:07,110 --> 00:20:10,020
- Yeah, well look, I got a lot to do,

428
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:10,853
being a groom and all.

429
00:20:10,853 --> 00:20:11,940
So I better head back inside.

430
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:13,736
So, thank you again for the help.

431
00:20:13,736 --> 00:20:14,830
- Mm-hmm.
- Mmm.

432
00:20:18,418 --> 00:20:20,918
(tense music)

433
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:23,780
- Hold yourself together, Charlee.

434
00:20:25,012 --> 00:20:26,263
You got this.

435
00:20:26,263 --> 00:20:28,930
(door knocking)

436
00:20:33,715 --> 00:20:34,798
Oh, it's you.

437
00:20:35,723 --> 00:20:37,149
- Hey.

438
00:20:37,149 --> 00:20:39,210
I finally met your brother.

439
00:20:39,210 --> 00:20:40,969
Striking resemblance.

440
00:20:40,969 --> 00:20:43,720
- (chuckling) Thanks for noticing.

441
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:45,183
I got that a lot growing up.

442
00:20:47,170 --> 00:20:48,420
- How are you holding up?

443
00:20:50,950 --> 00:20:52,067
- I'm all right.

444
00:20:54,180 --> 00:20:56,743
- It has to be this way,
you know that right?

445
00:20:58,337 --> 00:20:59,623
- You keep saying that.

446
00:21:01,090 --> 00:21:02,093
- I still like you.

447
00:21:03,340 --> 00:21:05,603
It's just that I'm
marrying Maria tomorrow.

448
00:21:07,431 --> 00:21:09,693
Doesn't mean that we still
can't have our thing.

449
00:21:12,118 --> 00:21:13,723
And you still drive me crazy.

450
00:21:15,170 --> 00:21:19,070
You know, I haven't slept with Maria

451
00:21:19,070 --> 00:21:20,770
since I've been sleeping with you.

452
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:24,723
- Well then why can't we be together?

453
00:21:24,723 --> 00:21:26,703
- Because, I need to marry Maria.

454
00:21:28,972 --> 00:21:31,100
I mean, something drastic
would have to happen

455
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:32,200
for us to be together.

456
00:21:34,020 --> 00:21:34,853
- Okay.

457
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:36,873
- Okay.

458
00:21:54,361 --> 00:21:58,040
- Are you Colonel Manley's servant?

459
00:21:58,040 --> 00:21:59,963
- I work with Colonel Manley.

460
00:22:01,860 --> 00:22:03,033
- Yeah right, Seal.

461
00:22:03,033 --> 00:22:04,866
What's the difference?

462
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:07,050
- I look better in uniform.

463
00:22:08,090 --> 00:22:09,163
- [Jenny] I'm sure you do.

464
00:22:10,650 --> 00:22:11,483
- I really do.

465
00:22:12,660 --> 00:22:16,260
- Women like a well-mannered
man in uniform.

466
00:22:16,260 --> 00:22:17,913
It makes them all want burritos.

467
00:22:19,525 --> 00:22:21,800
(both laugh)

468
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:22,633
Right?

469
00:22:25,307 --> 00:22:26,940
No?

470
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:28,020
- You stole that from Dimple.

471
00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:30,090
- No, no I didn't.

472
00:22:30,090 --> 00:22:30,923
- Yeah, you did.

473
00:22:30,923 --> 00:22:32,220
Crass doesn't come from you.

474
00:22:34,150 --> 00:22:35,670
- Man.

475
00:22:35,670 --> 00:22:36,970
He tried it on us earlier.

476
00:22:37,830 --> 00:22:39,650
I don't know what to think about that guy.

477
00:22:39,650 --> 00:22:40,840
- I don't like him.

478
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:42,370
- Why is that?

479
00:22:42,370 --> 00:22:44,397
- A friend of mine knew him before Maria

480
00:22:44,397 --> 00:22:46,023
and he was an asshole to her.

481
00:22:48,310 --> 00:22:50,710
He has this way of manipulating people

482
00:22:50,710 --> 00:22:52,410
into this false sense of security.

483
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:56,270
She told me he took her out
to this empty field at night

484
00:22:56,270 --> 00:22:58,140
and started making moves on her.

485
00:22:58,140 --> 00:22:59,033
She was a virgin.

486
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:01,753
- I mean,

487
00:23:03,723 --> 00:23:06,223
can you really blame a guy
for trying to get laid?

488
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:09,500
- You can when he's lying to people.

489
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:10,333
- Yeah.

490
00:23:11,618 --> 00:23:12,451
I guess.

491
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:16,060
- She had a really hard time after that.

492
00:23:16,060 --> 00:23:17,740
- Why, what happened?

493
00:23:17,740 --> 00:23:18,573
- She died.

494
00:23:20,421 --> 00:23:21,583
- (sighs) Boy.

495
00:23:23,562 --> 00:23:27,553
- (laughs) Your face.

496
00:23:29,810 --> 00:23:31,130
- [Nate] What about my face?

497
00:23:31,130 --> 00:23:32,190
- No, she's totally fine.

498
00:23:32,190 --> 00:23:33,640
She has a husband and two kids.

499
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:35,100
And at least he paid for the abortion.

500
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:36,500
- Man, that's messed up.

501
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:37,600
- [Jenny] Told you so.

502
00:23:39,250 --> 00:23:40,643
- Dimple's a dick.

503
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:43,890
- [Charlee] Hey, I'm not carrying this.

504
00:23:43,890 --> 00:23:44,895
- Thanks.
- Your room's the last one

505
00:23:44,895 --> 00:23:45,951
on the left.

506
00:23:45,951 --> 00:23:46,784
- Thank you.

507
00:23:46,784 --> 00:23:48,440
- Make sure you wear something nice.

508
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:49,500
- I will!

509
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:51,430
- And not that shirt you always wear.

510
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:54,320
I know you think it looks
good, but it doesn't.

511
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:55,523
- No promises.

512
00:23:58,280 --> 00:24:00,760
Hey, about your friend I met earlier.

513
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:02,530
- Forget about it, soldier.

514
00:24:02,530 --> 00:24:05,733
She's taken. (chuckling)

515
00:24:09,620 --> 00:24:11,276
Wait!

516
00:24:11,276 --> 00:24:12,866
Wait!

Keep it together.

- Franklin Godfried Tyler.

I know this isn't your favorite
thing to do every summer.

524
00:24:55,804 --> 00:24:56,830
I need you to pay attention.

525
00:24:56,830 --> 00:25:01,470
Could you try, just try to
offer better customer service.

526
00:25:01,470 --> 00:25:02,880
- Okay.

527
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:05,100
- Because it doesn't seem
like you care all that much.

528
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:07,490
- No, I don't, Uncle Tobias.

529
00:25:07,490 --> 00:25:08,323
All right, the only reason I'm here

530
00:25:08,323 --> 00:25:10,020
is because aunt June makes you hire me

531
00:25:10,020 --> 00:25:11,433
every single year, it sucks.

532
00:25:11,433 --> 00:25:12,810
This hotel sucks!

00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:15,230
- Oh, I don't care.

535
00:25:15,230 --> 00:25:16,080
- Hello.

536
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:18,130
I hope you're enjoying your
stay at the Royal Tyler.

537
00:25:18,130 --> 00:25:19,930
We'll have dinner ready in a moment.

538
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:31,963
Good evening.

539
00:25:33,270 --> 00:25:36,260
Tonight's menu is from Martha Washington's

540
00:25:36,260 --> 00:25:40,143
original recipe book as written in 1789.

541
00:25:41,470 --> 00:25:43,233
Can everyone please take their seats?

542
00:25:46,650 --> 00:25:48,770
As is our custom here at the Royal Tyler,

543
00:25:48,770 --> 00:25:52,180
we would like to offer a
blessing for this meal.

544
00:25:52,180 --> 00:25:54,212
Could someone lead us in a word of prayer?

545
00:25:54,212 --> 00:25:55,720
- Mhmm.

546
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:56,553
- Go ahead, sir.

547
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:05,403
- Dear Lord.

548
00:26:07,270 --> 00:26:08,770
Thank you for this food, Lord.

549
00:26:10,135 --> 00:26:13,561
I want to thank you for
friends and family, Lord.

550
00:26:13,561 --> 00:26:17,883
And thank you for blessing
us, Lord, with this fine meal,

551
00:26:19,010 --> 00:26:21,343
and with all these fine women.

552
00:26:23,270 --> 00:26:26,726
People, fine people, Lord, amen.

553
00:26:26,726 --> 00:26:28,226
- [Everyone] Amen.

554
00:26:30,772 --> 00:26:34,189
(energetic string music)

555
00:26:44,977 --> 00:26:47,977
(guests chattering)

556
00:26:49,196 --> 00:26:50,196
- (snapping) Gramps.

557
00:26:54,090 --> 00:26:55,110
You got any good stuff?

558
00:26:55,110 --> 00:26:57,310
Like from Europe, preferably French wine?

559
00:26:57,310 --> 00:26:58,730
- French?

560
00:26:58,730 --> 00:27:00,163
For you, certainly, sir.

561
00:27:03,030 --> 00:27:06,228
- It's nice to see you in
that vest for a change,

562
00:27:06,228 --> 00:27:08,143
instead of a scarf.

563
00:27:09,556 --> 00:27:10,389
- I don't know, Gray,

564
00:27:10,389 --> 00:27:11,923
I think you'd look good in one of those.

565
00:27:20,020 --> 00:27:22,153
- Oh, why don't you read my book?

566
00:27:22,153 --> 00:27:24,880
I cover a chapter of wine.

567
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:26,063
Yeah, Mr. Dimple.

568
00:27:27,250 --> 00:27:30,010
- It was pretty bold of you
to sell your father's business

569
00:27:30,010 --> 00:27:31,323
to start a book.

570
00:27:32,580 --> 00:27:34,163
- Yeah, yeah.

571
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:38,000
I think it's going to
be a big hit, though.

572
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,618
- What's the title of
the book going to be?

573
00:27:39,618 --> 00:27:41,922
- Oh, I don't want to
bore you about my book.

574
00:27:41,922 --> 00:27:42,755
It's, you know, new signs

575
00:27:42,755 --> 00:27:45,120
for this environmental
activism and blah blah.

576
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:47,513
- How about we get some wine from this?

577
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,570
Oh, it's a great bouquet.

578
00:27:53,570 --> 00:27:54,403
It's from,

579
00:27:59,558 --> 00:28:00,720
Spitaly.

580
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:03,433
- He and I had some great
times working together.

581
00:28:06,380 --> 00:28:09,327
I just wish he was still here
to see you and Maria now.

582
00:28:11,690 --> 00:28:12,547
- Psst, Jenny.

583
00:28:21,330 --> 00:28:22,780
What do you think about Nate?

584
00:28:23,694 --> 00:28:25,494
- [Jenny] He's cute, but I'm not sold.

585
00:28:25,494 --> 00:28:26,661
- Oh, come on.

586
00:28:27,613 --> 00:28:29,113
- Here it is, sir.

587
00:28:30,550 --> 00:28:33,940
I went to the depths of
the cellar for this one.

588
00:28:33,940 --> 00:28:35,750
Way in the back.

589
00:28:35,750 --> 00:28:38,503
Dusted it off just for you.

590
00:28:43,390 --> 00:28:45,020
Enjoy, my friend.

591
00:28:45,020 --> 00:28:48,647
- He pretended to not
know how to pick up girls.

592
00:28:48,647 --> 00:28:50,003
Oldest trick in the book.

593
00:28:51,044 --> 00:28:52,633
But I see through him.

594
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:56,962
- Cheers.

595
00:28:56,962 --> 00:28:58,900
Yeah.

596
00:28:58,900 --> 00:29:01,321
Mm-mm.

597
00:29:01,321 --> 00:29:02,321
Yeah.
- Yeah.

598
00:29:03,174 --> 00:29:04,350
- There's a little bit
of sediment in it too,

599
00:29:04,350 --> 00:29:05,700
which is actually a good thing.

600
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:07,050
- Can you believe this guy?

601
00:29:10,410 --> 00:29:11,363
- High in tannins.

602
00:29:14,310 --> 00:29:17,963
Mmm, really sweet.

603
00:29:19,170 --> 00:29:20,463
- [Both] What an ass.

604
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:23,630
- [Jenny] What's the
deal with you and Dimple?

605
00:29:23,630 --> 00:29:25,093
- What do you mean?

606
00:29:25,093 --> 00:29:26,158
- It's obvious you guys have been spending

607
00:29:26,158 --> 00:29:27,308
a lot of time together.

608
00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:33,490
- Let's all raise our glasses

609
00:29:33,490 --> 00:29:36,420
to a toast for the newlyweds,

610
00:29:36,420 --> 00:29:37,633
Dimple and Maria.

611
00:29:39,010 --> 00:29:40,330
- Okay, we're doing this.

612
00:29:40,330 --> 00:29:42,583
Toast time! (sighing)

613
00:29:45,422 --> 00:29:47,880
Gray, thank you for everything.

614
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:48,980
I feel really lucky

615
00:29:50,610 --> 00:29:51,443
to have known you

616
00:29:51,443 --> 00:29:54,020
and to be included in your family,

617
00:29:54,020 --> 00:29:56,750
and for everything you've
done for me and Maria.

618
00:29:56,750 --> 00:29:59,260
And I know I've been busy and caught up

619
00:29:59,260 --> 00:30:01,110
with the book and everything,

620
00:30:01,110 --> 00:30:04,070
and traveling to Europe and...

621
00:30:04,070 --> 00:30:07,340
But, I'm really proud
to call you my fiancee

622
00:30:08,630 --> 00:30:10,590
and I'm really looking
forward to tomorrow.

623
00:30:10,590 --> 00:30:12,163
And I'm glad everybody's here,

624
00:30:13,580 --> 00:30:16,513
even though my dad isn't, but Gray,

625
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:18,950
I'm glad you're here.

626
00:30:18,950 --> 00:30:22,223
So, to dad, to Gray,

627
00:30:23,310 --> 00:30:24,143
and to my babe.

628
00:30:26,966 --> 00:30:27,799
Cheers.

629
00:30:27,799 --> 00:30:28,632
- Cheers.

630
00:30:33,338 --> 00:30:36,088
(Charlee coughs)

631
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:44,523
- So this guy here, guest of honor,

632
00:30:45,900 --> 00:30:48,810
he offered me a job and I took it.

633
00:30:48,810 --> 00:30:50,610
It's in finance, it's a
little bit rough and tumble.

634
00:30:50,610 --> 00:30:53,140
We haven't kind of ironed out all the

635
00:30:53,140 --> 00:30:54,450
crinkles yet.
- Okay, yeah.

636
00:30:54,450 --> 00:30:55,693
- Congratulations, sir.

637
00:30:56,900 --> 00:30:59,233
Maria is an amazing lady.

638
00:31:00,300 --> 00:31:03,250
- The fruit doesn't fall
too far from the tree.

639
00:31:03,250 --> 00:31:04,083
- No, sir.

640
00:31:05,150 --> 00:31:05,983
It does not.

641
00:31:07,260 --> 00:31:10,113
- Dimple, I'm so proud of you.

642
00:31:11,112 --> 00:31:13,012
I always knew you'd land on your feet.

643
00:31:15,970 --> 00:31:17,223
- I like you, Henry.

644
00:31:18,499 --> 00:31:20,193
I wish I had a son like you.

645
00:31:21,140 --> 00:31:21,990
- Thank you, sir.

646
00:31:24,910 --> 00:31:26,820
- If I could encourage everyone

647
00:31:26,820 --> 00:31:29,000
to move into the living room,

648
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,993
we have a wonderful crackling fire.

649
00:31:33,070 --> 00:31:34,217
- Sounds nice.

650
00:31:34,217 --> 00:31:36,297
Yeah, let's go.

651
00:31:36,297 --> 00:31:37,897
- [Mr. Hazard] Mr. Von Dumpling.

652
00:31:39,060 --> 00:31:40,740
May we have a word for a moment?

653
00:31:40,740 --> 00:31:41,682
- I'll be right there.

654
00:31:41,682 --> 00:31:42,515
- Okay.

655
00:31:49,530 --> 00:31:51,820
- There are a few things that
I'd like to go over with you.

656
00:31:51,820 --> 00:31:52,863
Is this a good time?

657
00:31:54,290 --> 00:31:55,550
- Yeah, of course.

658
00:31:55,550 --> 00:31:57,600
I've got my whole life to spend with her.

659
00:31:58,550 --> 00:31:59,810
- Great.

660
00:31:59,810 --> 00:32:03,360
Now, I think that this particular client

661
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:06,490
is going to be rather difficult.

662
00:32:06,490 --> 00:32:08,690
And that is what I could
use your hand with.

663
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:11,690
- How do you deal with difficult clients?

664
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:14,823
- Easy, intimidation.

665
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:19,860
Other collectors will jerk
you around for six months

666
00:32:19,860 --> 00:32:20,840
and send you a letters,

667
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:24,203
or make phone calls
that get easily ignored.

668
00:32:25,070 --> 00:32:26,763
It's not even the same area code.

669
00:32:28,430 --> 00:32:31,663
I like to go straight to
the mark and get results.

670
00:32:32,830 --> 00:32:34,255
Can I show you something?

671
00:32:34,255 --> 00:32:35,088
- Yeah.

672
00:32:48,788 --> 00:32:50,951
(Dimples retching)

673
00:32:50,951 --> 00:32:52,794
- I know, right?

674
00:32:52,794 --> 00:32:54,460
It's absolutely garish.

675
00:32:54,460 --> 00:32:55,393
Look closely.

676
00:32:57,670 --> 00:32:58,503
Here.

677
00:33:00,900 --> 00:33:02,980
Look good, don't they?

678
00:33:08,350 --> 00:33:11,273
Ordinarily, showing them
the jar is quite enough.

679
00:33:12,300 --> 00:33:14,643
Occasionally though, you
do have to add to it.

680
00:33:15,750 --> 00:33:19,490
- What about something less invasive?

681
00:33:19,490 --> 00:33:20,710
- The nice thing about fingers

682
00:33:20,710 --> 00:33:23,080
is that people always take them with them.

683
00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:24,713
You can do it anywhere.

684
00:33:26,060 --> 00:33:28,543
Now, it's a great incentive program.

685
00:33:29,500 --> 00:33:31,410
The faster somebody pays,

686
00:33:31,410 --> 00:33:33,370
- The less likely they are,

687
00:33:33,370 --> 00:33:34,960
- To lose a finger, correct.

688
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:37,060
You get it.

689
00:33:37,060 --> 00:33:38,120
You're smart.

690
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:40,320
I think you might be
good at this after all.

691
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:44,733
How about you start on Monday?

692
00:33:47,150 --> 00:33:48,373
- Yeah, Monday.

693
00:33:49,690 --> 00:33:50,523
- Great.

694
00:33:52,050 --> 00:33:53,520
- Awesome.
- Until then.

695
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:54,730
- [Dimple] Yeah.

696
00:33:54,730 --> 00:33:55,953
Thank you so much.

697
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:02,400
(suspenseful music)

698
00:34:03,768 --> 00:34:06,518
(fire crackling)

699
00:34:09,596 --> 00:34:10,429
(light guitar music)

700
00:34:10,429 --> 00:34:12,273
- I think you're right, man.

701
00:34:13,723 --> 00:34:15,460
Here we go.

702
00:34:15,460 --> 00:34:16,293
Cheers.

703
00:34:17,660 --> 00:34:18,493
Oh, dear.

704
00:34:23,190 --> 00:34:24,560
What is that?

705
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:26,440
- [Jenny] It's a guitar.

706
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:28,970
- I know what it is, but
what are you playing?

707
00:34:28,970 --> 00:34:29,970
- Something I wrote.

708
00:34:31,100 --> 00:34:32,418
You play?

709
00:34:32,418 --> 00:34:35,560
- The piano, it's my weapon of choice.

710
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:37,160
- I'll believe it when I see it.

711
00:34:40,380 --> 00:34:41,880
- Be prepared to be impressed.

712
00:34:42,980 --> 00:34:44,680

Maria.

Mhmm.

(Maria laughing)

733
00:36:01,557 --> 00:36:03,550
- Amazing, amazing.

734
00:36:03,550 --> 00:36:04,673
- [Maria] Thank you.

735
00:36:04,673 --> 00:36:05,977
You didn't know I could sing.

736
00:36:05,977 --> 00:36:06,977
- I did not.

737
00:36:09,939 --> 00:36:12,772
(chill R&B music)

738
00:36:29,870 --> 00:36:31,563
- I think I officially retire.

739
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:35,020
- I think that would be best for everyone.

740
00:36:36,830 --> 00:36:37,830
- Look at these two.

741
00:36:39,130 --> 00:36:41,170
What a pair.

742
00:36:41,170 --> 00:36:42,830
- He's trying.

743
00:36:42,830 --> 00:36:45,399
- Yeah, I mean, that's not gonna work.

744
00:36:45,399 --> 00:36:47,403
- (chuckles) Tell me about it.

745
00:37:01,037 --> 00:37:02,443
- You see that up there?

746
00:37:03,870 --> 00:37:05,120
That's the little dipper,

747
00:37:06,190 --> 00:37:07,873
also known as Ursa minor.

748
00:37:09,890 --> 00:37:13,380
Now if you know nothing
about constellations,

749
00:37:13,380 --> 00:37:15,310
that'd be the bare minimum.

750
00:37:15,310 --> 00:37:16,210
- Really?

751
00:37:16,210 --> 00:37:17,592
- Yup.

752
00:37:17,592 --> 00:37:19,342
I tried to look for it myself once.

753
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:22,180
I had to do my research.

754
00:37:22,180 --> 00:37:24,330
Turns out the difference
was night and day.

755
00:37:25,271 --> 00:37:26,104
- Ha-ha.

756
00:37:27,170 --> 00:37:28,163
- What about you?

757
00:37:30,297 --> 00:37:31,793
You working on anyone?

758
00:37:33,510 --> 00:37:35,320
- Just myself.

759
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:37,169
- Oh.
(Henry chuckles)

760
00:37:37,169 --> 00:37:38,757
Yeah right, Colonel,

761
00:37:38,757 --> 00:37:39,757
sure.
- Mhmm.

762
00:37:51,613 --> 00:37:52,773
(punch bashing)
(Nate groaning)

763
00:37:52,773 --> 00:37:54,260
- Oh, not what I expected.

764
00:37:54,260 --> 00:37:56,300
- Oof. (laughs)

765
00:37:56,300 --> 00:37:57,740
- Really?

766
00:37:57,740 --> 00:37:59,100
- [Nate] What did I do?

767
00:37:59,100 --> 00:38:00,030
- Look at my eyes.

768
00:38:00,030 --> 00:38:00,863
- [Nate] No.

769
00:38:00,863 --> 00:38:01,771
- Look at them.

770
00:38:01,771 --> 00:38:03,292
- Those are witch eyes.

771
00:38:03,292 --> 00:38:05,000
- [Jenny] What were you thinking?

772
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,823
- For one, I thought you'd like it.

773
00:38:08,639 --> 00:38:09,472
- [Jenny] Ugh.

774
00:38:10,450 --> 00:38:12,050
- Dimple was right about you.

775
00:38:12,050 --> 00:38:13,083
You are crazy.

776
00:38:15,250 --> 00:38:17,123
- You ain't seen nothing yet.

777
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:26,680
- Hey buddy, I guess it didn't work out.

778
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:28,260
- Yep, still got it.

779
00:38:28,260 --> 00:38:30,320
- Hey, let's get you back inside, man.

780
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:31,153
Let's go.

781
00:38:31,153 --> 00:38:31,986
- Okay.
- Come on.

782
00:38:37,456 --> 00:38:39,730
- (sighs) Girl, what happened?

783
00:38:39,730 --> 00:38:40,860
I thought you liked that guy.

784
00:38:40,860 --> 00:38:42,027
- I do, he just...

785
00:38:42,027 --> 00:38:43,960
He has a big head.

786
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:47,093
- He does kind of, doesn't he? (laughs)

787
00:38:49,450 --> 00:38:52,270
- Sometimes, I don't know if
men are worth the trouble.

788
00:38:52,270 --> 00:38:54,953
Women never gave me this kind of drama.

789
00:38:56,220 --> 00:38:57,053
- That's true.

790
00:39:00,940 --> 00:39:04,313
- You're getting married tomorrow.

791
00:39:06,956 --> 00:39:08,658
- [Maria And Jenny] Whoa!

792
00:39:08,658 --> 00:39:09,491
- Charlee.

793
00:39:12,220 --> 00:39:16,207
- That was not there before. (laughs)

794
00:39:21,180 --> 00:39:25,100
You're getting married tomorrow.

795
00:39:25,100 --> 00:39:25,933
- [Maria] Yeah.

796
00:39:27,450 --> 00:39:29,333
- How does that feel?

797
00:39:33,910 --> 00:39:35,717
You're not happy, are you?

798
00:39:36,891 --> 00:39:37,724
- No, I mean,

799
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:41,293
I am, I should be.

800
00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:45,890
I was telling Jenny earlier,
I'm just getting cold feet.

801
00:39:45,890 --> 00:39:50,890
- Well, that is perfectly
normal. (chuckles)

802
00:39:54,300 --> 00:39:55,940
It's perfectly normal.

803
00:39:55,940 --> 00:39:59,363
But, you gotta follow your heart.

804
00:40:00,870 --> 00:40:02,839
- She's right, you know?

805
00:40:02,839 --> 00:40:04,270
- [Charlee] Mhmm.

806
00:40:04,270 --> 00:40:07,550
- Yeah, no I am, I am following my heart.

807
00:40:07,550 --> 00:40:09,960
Dimple is such a great guy.

808
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:12,150
He's... (sighs)

809
00:40:12,150 --> 00:40:12,983
He was different.

810
00:40:12,983 --> 00:40:14,620
He was the old Dimple.

811
00:40:14,620 --> 00:40:17,510
He was so sweet tonight, at dinner.

812
00:40:17,510 --> 00:40:20,780
And, he's just been stressed, you know?

813
00:40:20,780 --> 00:40:24,030
He's got the publisher
thing with his book.

814
00:40:24,030 --> 00:40:24,863
That's all.

815
00:40:25,858 --> 00:40:27,617
- He should still be making time for you.

816
00:40:27,617 --> 00:40:29,034
- [Charlee] Mhmm.

817
00:40:30,470 --> 00:40:31,303
- Yeah.

818
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:35,041
- I'm going to talk to him.

819
00:40:35,041 --> 00:40:36,027
- [Maria] No, Jenny,

820
00:40:36,027 --> 00:40:36,980
no, no, Jenny.
- I need to, I need to.

821
00:40:36,980 --> 00:40:37,950
- No, Jenny, don't do that.

822
00:40:37,950 --> 00:40:38,783
- I have to.

823
00:40:38,783 --> 00:40:40,843
- Jenny, don't say something stupid.

824
00:40:43,470 --> 00:40:45,373
I just hope she's not hard on him.

825
00:40:47,190 --> 00:40:49,453
- Oh girl, everything's
going to be all right.

826
00:40:50,520 --> 00:40:52,703
She's going to go, (laughs)

827
00:40:57,955 --> 00:40:59,770
I'm going to go talk to her.

828
00:40:59,770 --> 00:41:00,937
- Yeah?
- Mhmm.

829
00:41:02,580 --> 00:41:03,541
- Okay.

830
00:41:03,541 --> 00:41:06,757
- I'm gonna talk to her. (laughs)

831
00:41:06,757 --> 00:41:09,041
I got to get something from her anyway.

832
00:41:09,041 --> 00:41:10,034
Bye.

833
00:41:10,034 --> 00:41:10,867
- Bye.

834
00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:20,640
- Hello, Jenny.

835
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:22,710
Can you do something for me?

836
00:41:22,710 --> 00:41:23,543
- No.

837
00:41:23,543 --> 00:41:26,070
- I am William Von Dumpling's employer,

838
00:41:26,070 --> 00:41:29,130
and I need something delivered to him.

839
00:41:29,130 --> 00:41:30,824
- And why can't you do that?

840
00:41:30,824 --> 00:41:33,848
- I don't want to disturb him
with work before his big day.

841
00:41:33,848 --> 00:41:35,200
- What is it?

842
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:37,389
- A benefits package.

843
00:41:37,389 --> 00:41:38,222
- Hmm.

844
00:41:39,826 --> 00:41:40,909
That's weird.

845
00:41:41,930 --> 00:41:42,980
Whatever, I'll do it.

846
00:41:46,100 --> 00:41:48,000
Wait, since when does Dimple have a...

847
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:51,713
It's hot.

848
00:42:09,410 --> 00:42:11,363
Just the man I was looking for!

849
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:14,033
- Jenny!

850
00:42:15,030 --> 00:42:16,390
How are you doing?

851
00:42:16,390 --> 00:42:17,515
- [Jenny] What are you doing?

852
00:42:17,515 --> 00:42:19,110
- Nothing.

853
00:42:19,110 --> 00:42:20,660
- It doesn't look like nothing.

854
00:42:23,382 --> 00:42:25,853
- (sighs) Listen, Jenny.

855
00:42:27,538 --> 00:42:30,120
Jenster, Jenny Poo.

856
00:42:30,120 --> 00:42:31,170
- Don't call me that.

857
00:42:32,980 --> 00:42:33,813
- Okay.

858
00:42:36,110 --> 00:42:36,943
Don't tell Maria.

859
00:42:36,943 --> 00:42:37,983
- [Jenny] Don't tell Maria what?

860
00:42:41,160 --> 00:42:44,810
- I saw her

861
00:42:44,810 --> 00:42:46,380
with that guy Henry,

862
00:42:46,380 --> 00:42:48,963
and I got a little jealous.

863
00:42:50,620 --> 00:42:53,292
So I wanted to do something nice for her.

864
00:42:53,292 --> 00:42:55,500
Write her a little poem, you know,

865
00:42:55,500 --> 00:42:57,113
put some rose petals on the bed,

866
00:42:58,100 --> 00:43:00,093
get her excited about
the big day tomorrow.

867
00:43:03,050 --> 00:43:05,620
I'm just so busy with my book that

868
00:43:05,620 --> 00:43:08,243
I feel like I'm neglecting her.

869
00:43:10,790 --> 00:43:12,200
- Okay.

870
00:43:12,200 --> 00:43:13,033
I believe you.

871
00:43:14,540 --> 00:43:16,990
But here's a letter from
that creepy guy outside.

872
00:43:18,390 --> 00:43:20,840
He said it was a benefits package,

873
00:43:20,840 --> 00:43:22,640
but he looked like a debt collector.

874
00:43:23,710 --> 00:43:25,820
- How did you know he's a debt collector?

875
00:43:25,820 --> 00:43:26,653
- I dated one.

876
00:43:28,280 --> 00:43:29,340
- He gave off the same vibe-

877
00:43:29,340 --> 00:43:30,173
- [Jenny] She.

878
00:43:32,860 --> 00:43:34,573
- Okay, thank you for that.

879
00:43:36,233 --> 00:43:40,800
- Mhmm.

880
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:41,900
- I'll get that.

881
00:43:41,900 --> 00:43:42,733
- [Jenny] Dimple?

882
00:43:42,733 --> 00:43:43,680
- Yes?

883
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:44,880
- If you messed this up,

884
00:43:45,750 --> 00:43:47,593
I will cut off your Von Dumpling.

885
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:50,993
- Noted.

886
00:44:00,450 --> 00:44:01,450
Thanks again, Jenny.

887
00:44:01,450 --> 00:44:02,560
- [Jenny] Mhmm.

888
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:03,600
- Really appreciate it.

889
00:44:03,600 --> 00:44:04,433
- [Jenny] Yup.

890
00:44:30,450 --> 00:44:32,260
- Sir, I have received your markers

891
00:44:32,260 --> 00:44:34,350
for the Von Cash Casino.

892
00:44:34,350 --> 00:44:36,080
I have taken up your
note to Colonel Piquet

893
00:44:36,080 --> 00:44:40,200
and paid your debts to Lord
Lurcher and Sir Henry Rook.

894
00:44:40,200 --> 00:44:42,090
Enclosed are copies of these bills,

895
00:44:42,090 --> 00:44:44,523
which I have no doubt
will be paid immediately.

896
00:44:45,630 --> 00:44:48,530
If not, I am empowered to
use whatever means necessary

897
00:44:48,530 --> 00:44:50,130
to settle your debts.

898
00:44:50,130 --> 00:44:54,117
I am sir, your most humble
servant, John Hazard.

899
00:45:01,740 --> 00:45:04,240
(tense music)

900
00:45:16,662 --> 00:45:19,329
(clock ticking)

901
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:32,940
(light suspenseful music)

902
00:45:49,793 --> 00:45:52,460
(clock tolling)

903
00:45:59,258 --> 00:46:00,549
Hey there, geezer.

904
00:46:00,549 --> 00:46:02,000
(glass shattering)

905
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,833
How's the old trouble and strife?

906
00:46:08,838 --> 00:46:12,770
I'm sure she's just excited
to hear about your new job.

907
00:46:16,781 --> 00:46:18,940
Let's say we start on Monday morning

908
00:46:20,498 --> 00:46:22,853
in my office, settle up.

909
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:25,561
- Yep, Monday.

910
00:46:25,561 --> 00:46:26,623
Monday sounds good.

911
00:46:28,540 --> 00:46:33,070
We can, yeah, go over things and...

912
00:46:35,010 --> 00:46:37,283
Yeah, Monday, Monday, Monday.

913
00:46:45,467 --> 00:46:48,550
(light guitar music)

914
00:47:26,477 --> 00:47:28,873
- "Had we but world enough, and time."

915
00:47:51,146 --> 00:47:53,646
(Maria sighs)

916
00:47:59,921 --> 00:48:02,921
(crickets chirping)

917
00:48:07,365 --> 00:48:09,670
- Okay, okay, Jenny, I'm
going to try them all.

918
00:48:09,670 --> 00:48:10,570
And I've got everything.

919
00:48:10,570 --> 00:48:12,563
The red, the blue I've got it all.

920
00:48:13,470 --> 00:48:15,200
Hey.

921
00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:16,833
Just the man I want to see.

922
00:48:21,380 --> 00:48:24,930
I have got something to show you.

923
00:48:24,930 --> 00:48:25,763
Come with me.

924
00:48:28,944 --> 00:48:31,489
- Oh, thank God, you saved my life.

925
00:48:31,489 --> 00:48:33,980
- Shh, sit on the bed.

926
00:48:37,860 --> 00:48:41,151
You got me all excited with
that love letter, William.

927
00:48:41,151 --> 00:48:43,913
And now I want to give you something.

928
00:48:45,180 --> 00:48:46,603
- Oh, yeah.

929
00:48:46,603 --> 00:48:47,730
I like that.

930
00:48:47,730 --> 00:48:49,067
- I thought you might.

931
00:48:50,173 --> 00:48:54,573
Because I know exactly what you want.

932
00:48:55,500 --> 00:48:56,843
- You always do.

933
00:48:58,140 --> 00:48:59,340
- [Charlee] Wait for it.

934
00:49:03,271 --> 00:49:04,104
- Wow!

935
00:49:06,150 --> 00:49:07,077
- I know, right?

936
00:49:09,756 --> 00:49:10,589
Mhmm.

937
00:49:12,517 --> 00:49:14,347
(both giggling)

938
00:49:14,347 --> 00:49:16,440
You got me all hot and bothered.

939
00:49:16,440 --> 00:49:17,430
- Yeah, you know what, I just realized.

940
00:49:17,430 --> 00:49:19,467
I couldn't, I left the
burner on downstairs.

941
00:49:19,467 --> 00:49:22,480
- Well what about the
burner that's on upstairs?

942
00:49:22,480 --> 00:49:23,980
- Yeah, ooh, yeah!

943
00:49:25,863 --> 00:49:26,980
Flaming hot, yeah.

944
00:49:26,980 --> 00:49:29,070
I really need to turn that burner off.

945
00:49:29,070 --> 00:49:31,500
- Come on William, I know you want this.

946
00:49:31,500 --> 00:49:32,377
- Oh I do, I do, I do.

947
00:49:32,377 --> 00:49:34,015
I do, I do, I do, I really do.

948
00:49:34,015 --> 00:49:36,976
I do, I do, I do, I do.

949
00:49:36,976 --> 00:49:38,387
I do.

950
00:49:38,387 --> 00:49:40,210
But I really gotta turn
that burner off, baby,

951
00:49:40,210 --> 00:49:42,390
and I will be right back.

952
00:49:42,390 --> 00:49:44,939
- [Charlee] Now don't
make me wait too long.

953
00:49:44,939 --> 00:49:48,653
'Cause I got plans for you, boy. (laughs)

954
00:50:07,315 --> 00:50:08,148
(Dimple exclaiming)

955
00:50:08,148 --> 00:50:08,981
- Ah, oh!

956
00:50:08,981 --> 00:50:11,414
Oh, baby, hey.

957
00:50:11,414 --> 00:50:12,940
- Hiya.
- Hi, baby.

958
00:50:12,940 --> 00:50:14,620
- I'm working on this thought.

959
00:50:14,620 --> 00:50:16,780
I've got a really awesome
thought about the book.

960
00:50:16,780 --> 00:50:17,613
- Okay.

961
00:50:17,613 --> 00:50:19,055
- Just give me a second and

962
00:50:19,055 --> 00:50:20,216
I'll be right back.

963
00:50:20,216 --> 00:50:21,049
- Okay?

964
00:50:24,478 --> 00:50:27,980
- [Henry] The thing is, she'll be happier.

965
00:50:27,980 --> 00:50:29,580
- [Nate] At least you got horns.

966
00:50:35,340 --> 00:50:38,170
- Nate, I can't stop thinking about her.

967
00:50:38,170 --> 00:50:39,940
- You got to talk to her,
tell her how you feel.

968
00:50:39,940 --> 00:50:40,773
You're the Colonel, man.

969
00:50:40,773 --> 00:50:41,834
You the man.

970
00:50:41,834 --> 00:50:42,768
- You're right, you're right.
- Do it!

971
00:50:42,768 --> 00:50:43,601
- You're right, you're right.

972
00:50:43,601 --> 00:50:45,030
I'm going to take care of this.

973
00:50:46,017 --> 00:50:46,850
(Maria gasps)

974
00:50:46,850 --> 00:50:48,718
(door slams)

975
00:50:48,718 --> 00:50:53,718
(crickets chirping)
(chill blues guitar music)

976
00:51:32,596 --> 00:51:33,513
- You okay?

977
00:51:43,700 --> 00:51:45,053
You guys grew up together.

978
00:51:47,780 --> 00:51:50,750
You're marrying an educated man, you said.

979
00:51:50,750 --> 00:51:53,233
Plus, you're running the family business.

980
00:51:54,290 --> 00:51:55,880
- Dad.

981
00:51:55,880 --> 00:51:58,620
I want true love.

982
00:51:58,620 --> 00:51:59,720
- [Gray] Don't we all?

983
00:52:02,930 --> 00:52:04,633
- Marriage is serious.

984
00:52:06,410 --> 00:52:07,530
- [Gray] Absolutely.

985
00:52:07,530 --> 00:52:10,480
- Marriage is not something
that I want to rush into.

986
00:52:10,480 --> 00:52:12,260
It's tied to happiness for me.

987
00:52:12,260 --> 00:52:14,010
- That's true.

988
00:52:14,010 --> 00:52:18,393
But baby, you knew this day was coming.

989
00:52:19,410 --> 00:52:20,593
You should be happy.

990
00:52:25,160 --> 00:52:25,993
You know,

991
00:52:28,040 --> 00:52:30,270
I remember the day when
I popped the question

992
00:52:30,270 --> 00:52:31,317
to your mother.

993
00:52:32,540 --> 00:52:33,863
She was over the moon.

994
00:52:36,313 --> 00:52:38,110
- It's 'cause she married
the man of her dreams.

995
00:52:38,110 --> 00:52:43,110
- Oh, spoken from someone
who's a little unbiased.

996
00:52:43,308 --> 00:52:45,725
(both laugh)

997
00:52:50,830 --> 00:52:52,800
Dimple's a decent guy.

998
00:52:52,800 --> 00:52:55,610
- Ugh, daddy, no.

999
00:52:55,610 --> 00:52:56,633
- [Gray] He is.

1000
00:52:57,490 --> 00:52:59,260
He comes from a solid family.

1001
00:52:59,260 --> 00:53:00,803
What more could you ask for?

1002
00:53:03,230 --> 00:53:04,293
- Butterflies.

1003
00:53:06,020 --> 00:53:07,960
True love.

1004
00:53:07,960 --> 00:53:10,980
I want to come home
and see my best friend.

1005
00:53:10,980 --> 00:53:14,023
- Yeah, and you'll have all those things.

1006
00:53:15,960 --> 00:53:16,793
You will.

1007
00:53:17,940 --> 00:53:19,980
I love you to pieces, you know that?

1008
00:53:19,980 --> 00:53:20,813
- I know.

1009
00:53:21,670 --> 00:53:22,503
- Be brave.

1010
00:53:23,840 --> 00:53:26,490
I'll see that both you and
he are well taken care of.

1011
00:53:30,758 --> 00:53:32,353
- (sighs) For you, Daddy,

1012
00:53:33,570 --> 00:53:34,670
I will follow through.

1013
00:53:36,090 --> 00:53:41,090
- That's my girl. (chuckles)

1014
00:53:43,650 --> 00:53:47,310
Hey, stay focused.

1015
00:53:47,310 --> 00:53:50,793
And don't you ever, ever doubt.

1016
00:53:55,310 --> 00:53:56,190
Love you.

1017
00:53:56,190 --> 00:53:57,023
- I love you.

1018
00:54:16,238 --> 00:54:19,238
(crickets chirping)

1019
00:54:42,911 --> 00:54:46,630
- (sighs) Maria, can you
take a seat for a minute?

1020
00:54:46,630 --> 00:54:47,673
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1021
00:54:49,040 --> 00:54:50,230
- What's wrong?

1022
00:54:50,230 --> 00:54:51,130
- Nothing's wrong.

1023
00:54:52,011 --> 00:54:54,210
I just need to get something off my chest.

1024
00:54:54,210 --> 00:54:55,043
- Okay.

1025
00:54:56,720 --> 00:54:57,553
- Maria.

1026
00:55:00,090 --> 00:55:02,420
I haven't been able to
stop thinking about you

1027
00:55:02,420 --> 00:55:04,500
since we first met.

1028
00:55:04,500 --> 00:55:08,940
And I've always been
someone with a clear head

1029
00:55:08,940 --> 00:55:10,813
and focus in front of him.

1030
00:55:13,010 --> 00:55:15,650
And I've never felt like this before,

1031
00:55:15,650 --> 00:55:18,623
and I don't know what to do about it.

1032
00:55:19,530 --> 00:55:22,150
And I know that we just met earlier today

1033
00:55:22,150 --> 00:55:25,220
and I know this is crazy,

1034
00:55:25,220 --> 00:55:30,220
but it feels like I've
known you my entire life.

1035
00:55:30,360 --> 00:55:33,483
And I know, and I know
if I don't say something,

1036
00:55:35,380 --> 00:55:37,993
I'm going to regret it for the rest of it.

1037
00:55:39,060 --> 00:55:39,893
Maria.

1038
00:55:42,840 --> 00:55:43,673
I love you.

1039
00:55:47,060 --> 00:55:48,060
- This can't happen.

1040
00:55:50,560 --> 00:55:51,423
We can't.

1041
00:55:52,460 --> 00:55:54,540
This is not going to happen.

1042
00:55:54,540 --> 00:55:56,880
I am set to marry the man

1043
00:55:56,880 --> 00:56:00,450
that my father loves for me to marry.

1044
00:56:00,450 --> 00:56:01,640
I can't break it off now,

1045
00:56:01,640 --> 00:56:03,380
it would break his heart.

1046
00:56:03,380 --> 00:56:06,290
- You're going to marry
a man that you don't love

1047
00:56:06,290 --> 00:56:08,253
because he has your father's approval?

1048
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:12,553
The man you're about to marry is a fraud.

1049
00:56:13,560 --> 00:56:15,383
We all can see it, why can't you?

1050
00:56:17,540 --> 00:56:19,240
- Don't talk to me like that.

1051
00:56:19,240 --> 00:56:21,920
I'm capable of making my own decisions.

1052
00:56:21,920 --> 00:56:23,447
- Yes, and that's disappointing.

1053
00:56:23,447 --> 00:56:26,340
And if you don't feel the same
way about me, that's fine.

1054
00:56:26,340 --> 00:56:27,800
- Oh please.

1055
00:56:27,800 --> 00:56:29,590
- Yes, that's fine.

1056
00:56:29,590 --> 00:56:30,870
But I'm not going to stay here

1057
00:56:30,870 --> 00:56:35,670
and watch you marry someone
that you don't belong with.

1058
00:56:35,670 --> 00:56:36,503
- Henry.

1059
00:56:38,760 --> 00:56:40,160
- I have five words for you.

1060
00:56:41,400 --> 00:56:44,393
Goodbye, Mrs. Maria Von dumpling.

1061
00:56:45,270 --> 00:56:46,277
- Henry, don't.

1062
00:56:47,605 --> 00:56:48,438
Don't go.

1063
00:56:53,009 --> 00:56:55,509
(car revving)

1064
00:56:57,693 --> 00:57:00,360
(Maria sobbing)

1065
00:57:01,267 --> 00:57:04,613
- For lady, you deserve the state

1066
00:57:04,613 --> 00:57:07,363
nor would I love at a lower rate.

1067
00:57:08,779 --> 00:57:09,946
Yours, Dimple.

1068
00:57:11,130 --> 00:57:12,423
Always the romantic.

1069
00:57:14,300 --> 00:57:17,360
And age, at least to every part,

1070
00:57:17,360 --> 00:57:20,993
and the last age should know your heart.

1071
00:57:22,640 --> 00:57:24,523
What are you saying, Mr. Dimple?

1072
00:57:26,390 --> 00:57:27,223
Hmm.

1073
00:57:31,110 --> 00:57:33,380
- For lady, you deserve the state

1074
00:57:33,380 --> 00:57:35,030
nor would I love at a lower rate.

1075
00:57:46,819 --> 00:57:49,652
(Charlee humming)

1076
00:57:51,516 --> 00:57:55,290
- (chuckles) For lady,
you deserve the state.

1077
00:57:55,290 --> 00:57:59,163
Nor would I love at a lower rate. (laughs)

1078
00:58:00,690 --> 00:58:03,203
Gotcha. (humming)

1079
00:58:05,764 --> 00:58:08,764
(somber rock music)

1080
00:58:12,910 --> 00:58:16,400
- But at my back, I always hear

1081
00:58:17,490 --> 00:58:20,963
time's winged chariot hurrying near.

1082
00:58:30,005 --> 00:58:32,229
(Maria sobbing)

1083

1086
00:58:46,871 --> 00:58:48,204
What am I doing?

1087
00:58:53,750 --> 00:58:55,945
I can't believe this.

1088
00:58:55,945 --> 00:58:56,862
Okay, okay.

1089
00:58:58,272 --> 00:59:01,180
Think about it, think about it.

1090
00:59:01,180 --> 00:59:02,443
I always have a plan.

1091
00:59:03,330 --> 00:59:04,780
This is not part of the plan.

1092
00:59:05,906 --> 00:59:07,353
Oh my god, that's Nate doing.

1093
00:59:07,353 --> 00:59:10,610
It's just so smooth and confident.

1094
00:59:10,610 --> 00:59:11,583
I'm in control.

1095
00:59:12,490 --> 00:59:15,280
I'm a Colonel, and I'm going to come down

1096
00:59:15,280 --> 00:59:18,400
and give you the orders that
you're going to love me.

1097
00:59:18,400 --> 00:59:20,764
That's it, me and you.

1098
00:59:20,764 --> 00:59:24,210
What are you doing, just, just, (sighing)

1099
00:59:24,210 --> 00:59:27,290
Just be smooth, be calm, be smooth.

1100
00:59:27,290 --> 00:59:28,603
Be like Nate.

1101
00:59:28,603 --> 00:59:30,053
Not like water, be like Nate.

1102
00:59:32,379 --> 00:59:33,212
Okay.

1103
01:00:12,950 --> 01:00:15,450
(car revving)

1104
01:00:41,810 --> 01:00:44,560
(birds chirping)

1105
01:00:47,200 --> 01:00:48,543
- I can't do it, man.

1106
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:52,140
I am scared of this woman.

1107
01:00:52,140 --> 01:00:54,658
I ain't been scared of a girl before.

1108
01:00:54,658 --> 01:00:55,908
- You need to suck it up.

1109
01:00:57,790 --> 01:00:58,623
- Shit.

1110
01:01:00,200 --> 01:01:01,473
(sighs) You're right.

1111
01:01:05,330 --> 01:01:06,230
How are you doing?

1112
01:01:07,635 --> 01:01:08,900
I thought I saw you leaving last night.

1113
01:01:08,900 --> 01:01:11,630
- Oh, I tried to leave.

1114
01:01:11,630 --> 01:01:14,473
I told Maria that I loved her.

1115
01:01:16,290 --> 01:01:18,130
- [Nate] Well, you got balls, man.

1116
01:01:18,130 --> 01:01:21,020
- Can I ask you for some advice, Sergeant?

1117
01:01:21,020 --> 01:01:22,423
- [Nate] Yeah, absolutely.

1118
01:01:23,580 --> 01:01:25,180
- What the hell am I doing here?

1119
01:01:26,610 --> 01:01:29,377
I'm in love with a woman
who's marrying someone else.

1120
01:01:29,377 --> 01:01:30,713
And for some reason,

1121
01:01:32,030 --> 01:01:33,253
I couldn't just leave.

1122
01:01:35,560 --> 01:01:36,810
- [Nate] It's tough, man.

1123
01:01:38,021 --> 01:01:39,271
- And the worst thing is,

1124
01:01:40,740 --> 01:01:42,530
I don't think he's right for her.

1125
01:01:42,530 --> 01:01:45,540
I really don't trust him.

1126
01:01:45,540 --> 01:01:48,050
- Remember when we were
in Afghanistan together

1127
01:01:49,250 --> 01:01:51,763
and we were in that village in the north,

1128
01:01:52,950 --> 01:01:55,773
and we stopped to help
that man and his son?

1129
01:01:57,950 --> 01:02:00,170
Our orders were to keep moving,

1130
01:02:00,170 --> 01:02:02,290
keep moving 'cause they will reports

1131
01:02:02,290 --> 01:02:04,540
of hostiles in that area.

1132
01:02:04,540 --> 01:02:07,010
But you thought it was
the right thing to do

1133
01:02:07,010 --> 01:02:09,923
to disobey that command and help that man.

1134
01:02:12,215 --> 01:02:15,650
Well, you did the right thing then,

1135
01:02:15,650 --> 01:02:17,890
and you'll do the right thing now.

1136
01:02:17,890 --> 01:02:18,940
- [Henry] I've tried.

1137
01:02:20,760 --> 01:02:22,303
- Well then maybe that's not it.

1138
01:02:25,950 --> 01:02:30,950
♪ Can we stay here ♪

1139
01:02:31,015 --> 01:02:35,848

1140

1143
01:03:02,177 --> 01:03:03,680
- And it was so much fun playing

1144
01:03:03,680 --> 01:03:05,870
with Maria again last night.

1145
01:03:05,870 --> 01:03:07,620
We haven't done that since college.

1146
01:03:08,940 --> 01:03:10,740
She really should have been a singer.

1147
01:03:10,740 --> 01:03:12,363
- Yeah, she's really good.

1148
01:03:13,320 --> 01:03:14,987
She loves her career.
- Yeah.

1149
01:03:14,987 --> 01:03:16,537
- And she's good at it.

1150
01:03:16,537 --> 01:03:18,620
- [Jenny] Mhmm, that too.

1151
01:03:21,550 --> 01:03:22,750
- Hey, what do you want?

1152
01:03:23,970 --> 01:03:25,560
- Good morning.

1153
01:03:25,560 --> 01:03:26,810
What's in the Dutch baby?

1154
01:03:28,060 --> 01:03:29,520
- It doesn't say.

1155
01:03:29,520 --> 01:03:31,220
- That's why I'm asking, Einstein.

1156
01:03:32,900 --> 01:03:34,030
I'll take the Eggs Benedict.

1157
01:03:34,030 --> 01:03:35,739
- [Frank] We don't have any of that.

1158
01:03:35,739 --> 01:03:37,439
We just ran out, sorry about that.

1159
01:03:38,320 --> 01:03:39,250
- I'll grab the oatmeal, then.

1160
01:03:39,250 --> 01:03:40,800
- We don't have any more of that either.

1161
01:03:40,800 --> 01:03:43,229
- Jesus, what do you have?

1162
01:03:43,229 --> 01:03:45,823
- So if you look right here, cereal.

1163
01:03:47,150 --> 01:03:48,892
- Is it gluten-free?

1164
01:03:48,892 --> 01:03:49,774
- You're asking a lot of questions.

1165
01:03:49,774 --> 01:03:50,607
Do you want me to step away,

1166
01:03:50,607 --> 01:03:52,593
smoke this cigarette and come back to you?

1167
01:03:52,593 --> 01:03:53,426
- You know what?

1168
01:03:53,426 --> 01:03:55,490
I'll take the cereal and a big whiskey.

1169
01:03:55,490 --> 01:03:56,323
- All right.

1170
01:04:04,410 --> 01:04:05,810
- [Dimple] Don't bother ordering anything,

1171
01:04:05,810 --> 01:04:08,220
the service here sucks.

1172
01:04:08,220 --> 01:04:09,257
- It's not that bad.

1173
01:04:15,341 --> 01:04:17,830
- Do you know where Maria is right now?

1174
01:04:17,830 --> 01:04:20,500
- She's probably getting ready

1175
01:04:20,500 --> 01:04:22,420
for her wedding day, no doubt.

1176
01:04:22,420 --> 01:04:23,500
- Hey, I need to go find her.

1177
01:04:23,500 --> 01:04:26,810
I found this in the
living room this morning.

1178
01:04:26,810 --> 01:04:27,713
- [Charlee] What's that?

1179
01:04:29,120 --> 01:04:31,043
- It's a love letter from Dimple.

1180
01:04:32,554 --> 01:04:33,904
It's actually pretty sweet.

1181
01:04:35,040 --> 01:04:37,560
I thought he was such an asshole,

1182
01:04:37,560 --> 01:04:40,523
but I talked to him last night
and he doesn't seem so bad.

1183
01:04:42,050 --> 01:04:43,370
- Yeah, that's nice.

1184
01:04:43,370 --> 01:04:44,203
- Yeah.

1185
01:04:47,710 --> 01:04:48,543
- You know what?

1186
01:04:48,543 --> 01:04:50,300
I've got to go up to her room anyway,

1187
01:04:50,300 --> 01:04:51,300
so why don't I just

1188
01:04:51,300 --> 01:04:52,660
take that?
- It's okay, I mean I'm,

1189
01:04:52,660 --> 01:04:54,560
I'm almost done here anyway, I got it.

1190
01:04:57,020 --> 01:04:59,371
- I'm taking it, give it to me.

1191
01:04:59,371 --> 01:05:00,204
- What?

1192
01:05:00,204 --> 01:05:02,493
- That girl is driving me crazy.

1193
01:05:03,650 --> 01:05:04,830
- No luck, huh?

1194
01:05:04,830 --> 01:05:05,743
- Nah, man.

1195
01:05:06,620 --> 01:05:08,020
I'm running out of material.

1196
01:05:10,560 --> 01:05:12,310
I've never had this trouble before.

1197
01:05:15,190 --> 01:05:18,590
Somehow, it just makes her hotter.

1198
01:05:18,590 --> 01:05:19,423
- Yeah, with Jenny,

1199
01:05:19,423 --> 01:05:20,930
she just doesn't like the
whole suave stuck routine.

1200
01:05:20,930 --> 01:05:22,780
Just try being yourself, act natural.

1201
01:05:23,890 --> 01:05:26,380
- Hasn't been looking good lately.

1202
01:05:26,380 --> 01:05:28,215
- Nate, what up man?

1203
01:05:28,215 --> 01:05:29,060
How you doing brother?

1204
01:05:29,060 --> 01:05:30,920
Dude, that suit is bad ass.

1205
01:05:30,920 --> 01:05:32,260
You should get a suit like this.

1206
01:05:32,260 --> 01:05:34,970
Dude thanks so much for
the advice the other night.

1207
01:05:34,970 --> 01:05:37,250
I killed it with her, I appreciate it.

1208
01:05:37,250 --> 01:05:38,430
- Sorry to interrupt your bro time.

1209
01:05:38,430 --> 01:05:39,860
But where's the milk?
- Oh yeah by the way,

1210
01:05:39,860 --> 01:05:41,120
we don't have any more milk,

1211
01:05:41,120 --> 01:05:43,690
but that cereal is off the chain.

1212
01:05:43,690 --> 01:05:45,252
You need to just have it.

1213
01:05:45,252 --> 01:05:47,597
- How am I going to eat
cereal without milk?

1214
01:05:47,597 --> 01:05:48,900
- [Frank] I don't know, Nipple, right?

1215
01:05:48,900 --> 01:05:49,900
- It's Dimple.

1216
01:05:49,900 --> 01:05:50,733
My friends call me Dimple.

1217
01:05:50,733 --> 01:05:51,740
You can call me Sir.

1218
01:05:51,740 --> 01:05:52,790
- [Frank] I'm sorry, Sir Nipple.

1219
01:05:52,790 --> 01:05:53,697
Do you want the cereal or not?

1220
01:05:53,697 --> 01:05:55,290
- No, I can eat it.

1221
01:05:55,290 --> 01:05:56,123
- [Frank] Cool.

1222
01:05:56,123 --> 01:05:57,370
Asshole.

1223
01:05:57,370 --> 01:05:58,203
- Excuse me?

1224
01:05:59,130 --> 01:05:59,963
You know what?

1225
01:05:59,963 --> 01:06:01,010
I'm going to write the worst review

1226
01:06:01,010 --> 01:06:01,970
these guys have ever had.

1227
01:06:01,970 --> 01:06:03,830
- Come on, man.

1228
01:06:03,830 --> 01:06:06,130
At least he's honest,
you got to respect that.

1229
01:06:07,090 --> 01:06:08,243
- What?
- Hmm?

1230
01:06:09,664 --> 01:06:10,520
- You know what?

1231
01:06:11,912 --> 01:06:13,640
I'm going to find that crusty old manager

1232
01:06:13,640 --> 01:06:15,503
and I'm gonna give him a piece of my mind.

1233
01:06:17,890 --> 01:06:18,723
Gramps!

1234
01:06:20,370 --> 01:06:21,203
- You, now.

1235
01:06:22,550 --> 01:06:25,050
(tense music)

1236
01:06:28,800 --> 01:06:30,260
What's this?

1237
01:06:30,260 --> 01:06:32,500
You plan to break it off with the Maria?

1238
01:06:32,500 --> 01:06:33,963
You promised me.

1239
01:06:36,212 --> 01:06:40,596
- Char?

1240
01:06:40,596 --> 01:06:41,763
How could you?

1241
01:06:42,767 --> 01:06:46,233
Love letters to Charlee, my best friend?

1242
01:06:47,260 --> 01:06:50,270
- Any man that has your affection

1243
01:06:50,270 --> 01:06:51,610
can resist temptation, babe.

1244
01:06:51,610 --> 01:06:53,353
- No that's crap, and you know it.

1245
01:06:55,500 --> 01:06:56,500
- [Charlee] I agree.

1246
01:06:58,020 --> 01:07:00,763
- Ladies, this is a joyous moment.

1247
01:07:02,290 --> 01:07:03,740
Don't you see?

1248
01:07:03,740 --> 01:07:05,380
I love you both.

1249
01:07:05,380 --> 01:07:07,380
- What are you talking about?

1250
01:07:07,380 --> 01:07:09,200
- We all marry.

1251
01:07:09,200 --> 01:07:11,080
Come on over, let me run you through it.

1252
01:07:11,080 --> 01:07:14,255
I figured everything out
all legally, and everything.

1253
01:07:14,255 --> 01:07:17,005
(slaps whacking)

1254
01:07:18,545 --> 01:07:19,378
Ah!

1255
01:07:23,186 --> 01:07:24,936
Wait, wait right there for one sec.

1256
01:07:29,760 --> 01:07:30,593
Good riddance!

1257
01:07:33,530 --> 01:07:34,380
Well that worked.

1258
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:37,041
Did I tell you how
beautiful you look today?

1259
01:07:37,041 --> 01:07:37,874
- No, I'm leaving.

1260
01:07:37,874 --> 01:07:38,707
- No, honestly.

1261
01:07:38,707 --> 01:07:39,920
Just listen to me, okay?
- Dimple.

1262
01:07:39,920 --> 01:07:42,370
- Look, she was a bad egg, okay?

1263
01:07:42,370 --> 01:07:44,210
Now, I got cold feet, I admit it.

1264
01:07:44,210 --> 01:07:45,230
- It doesn't matter.
- We've been together

1265
01:07:45,230 --> 01:07:46,170
forever,
- Dimple, stop.

1266
01:07:46,170 --> 01:07:47,930
- And she came onto me one night,

1267
01:07:47,930 --> 01:07:49,430
and in my moment of weakness,

1268
01:07:49,430 --> 01:07:51,928
and one thing led to another,
but it doesn't matter.

1269
01:07:51,928 --> 01:07:52,761
- I don't wanna hear it.
- She's a bad egg

1270
01:07:52,761 --> 01:07:53,594
and it's best

1271
01:07:53,594 --> 01:07:54,427
that she's gone.
- I don't want to hear it

1272
01:07:54,427 --> 01:07:55,260
Dimple.
- Look, listen.

1273
01:07:55,260 --> 01:07:56,093
- No, no, no.
- Just sit down

1274
01:07:56,093 --> 01:07:57,330
and listen for a second, okay?

1275
01:07:57,330 --> 01:07:58,210
Who needs her?

1276
01:07:58,210 --> 01:07:59,489
We can get through anything, baby.

1277
01:07:59,489 --> 01:08:00,460
We've been through everything!
- Dimple!

1278
01:08:00,460 --> 01:08:01,870
It's over.

1279
01:08:01,870 --> 01:08:02,703
- No!

1280
01:08:02,703 --> 01:08:04,310
It's over when I say it's over.

1281
01:08:04,310 --> 01:08:05,143
- [Maria] What?

1282
01:08:05,143 --> 01:08:05,976
No, Dimple,

1283
01:08:05,976 --> 01:08:07,087
stop it!
- Shh.

1284
01:08:07,087 --> 01:08:10,024
- Dimple, no!
- Hold still!

1285
01:08:10,024 --> 01:08:10,857
- Maria?

1286
01:08:13,103 --> 01:08:13,936
Maria!

1287
01:08:16,565 --> 01:08:17,642
Maria!

1288
01:08:17,642 --> 01:08:20,475
- Watch out, watch out, watch out.

1289
01:08:21,952 --> 01:08:23,472
Get off of her!

1290
01:08:23,472 --> 01:08:24,722
- No, wait, no!

1291
01:08:27,571 --> 01:08:29,608
(Dimple growling)

1292
01:08:29,608 --> 01:08:31,463
(punch bashing)

1293
01:08:31,463 --> 01:08:32,984
Thank you.
- Don't worry.

1294
01:08:32,984 --> 01:08:33,817
Let's go.

1295
01:08:41,102 --> 01:08:41,935
- Yeah.

1296
01:08:49,330 --> 01:08:51,410
Come swallow this sword, GI Joe.

1297
01:08:51,410 --> 01:08:53,310
- I would never cross swords with you.

1298
01:08:56,012 --> 01:08:58,012
But you can't handle this one, trust me.

1299
01:09:00,255 --> 01:09:01,088
(rifle booming)

1300
01:09:01,088 --> 01:09:04,088
(Dimple exclaiming)

1301
01:09:05,970 --> 01:09:06,803
- Baby.

1302
01:09:08,456 --> 01:09:10,570
- What the hell is going on?

1303
01:09:10,570 --> 01:09:12,410
- It's not me, it's them.

1304
01:09:12,410 --> 01:09:13,243
They've lost it.

1305
01:09:13,243 --> 01:09:15,400
- Holy crap, I'm about to kick some ass.

1306
01:09:15,400 --> 01:09:16,600
Did you try and kill the Colonel?

1307
01:09:16,600 --> 01:09:18,520
- Steady Nate, he can't hurt me.

1308
01:09:18,520 --> 01:09:20,373
- I mean, I'd like to see him try.

1309
01:09:21,350 --> 01:09:23,002
I'll show you how Yankee boys play.

1310
01:09:23,002 --> 01:09:24,590
- What happened here?!
- Damn quick!

1311
01:09:24,590 --> 01:09:25,980
- You betrayed us!

1312
01:09:25,980 --> 01:09:27,170
You dirty dog.

1313
01:09:27,170 --> 01:09:28,003
- Dimple can explain.

1314
01:09:28,003 --> 01:09:30,690
It'd be quite the story
for a future father-in-law.

1315
01:09:30,690 --> 01:09:31,523
Let's hear it.

1316
01:09:32,610 --> 01:09:35,840
- Sir, I was talking with
your daughter on the couch

1317
01:09:35,840 --> 01:09:38,300
and then this brute attacked me!

1318
01:09:38,300 --> 01:09:39,133
- Bullcrap!

1319
01:09:39,133 --> 01:09:39,966
Maria, what happened?

1320
01:09:39,966 --> 01:09:40,799
- He's lying!
- No!

1321
01:09:40,799 --> 01:09:43,234
- He attacked me, Dad, he attacked me!

1322
01:09:43,234 --> 01:09:44,273
- You lying-

1323
01:09:44,273 --> 01:09:46,760
(knee bashing)
(Dimple screeching)

1324
01:09:46,760 --> 01:09:48,880
My Von Dumpling!

1325
01:09:48,880 --> 01:09:51,800
Sir, I can't really get
into specifics here,

1326
01:09:51,800 --> 01:09:54,150
but if you want to go
into private, we can chat.

1327
01:09:54,150 --> 01:09:56,480
- You have nothing else to say to me,

1328
01:09:56,480 --> 01:09:59,400
except what is this about
a debt with Mr. Hazard?

1329
01:09:59,400 --> 01:10:00,233
- Who told you?

1330
01:10:02,629 --> 01:10:04,110
You're going to hear from my lawyer.

1331
01:10:04,110 --> 01:10:05,282
- And you from me.

1332
01:10:05,282 --> 01:10:08,587
(Dimple snapping)

1333
01:10:08,587 --> 01:10:10,853
- (groaning) Fine.

1334
01:10:11,940 --> 01:10:13,200
You watch how I leave,

1335
01:10:13,200 --> 01:10:15,403
the man who's received
the polish of Europe.

1336
01:10:20,206 --> 01:10:23,278
Guys, let's think about this, come on.

1337
01:10:23,278 --> 01:10:26,111
(Dimple grunting)

1338
01:10:29,557 --> 01:10:31,507
- [Frank] I'm going to keep your scarf.

1339
01:10:37,499 --> 01:10:40,249
(Jenny growling)

1340
01:10:50,360 --> 01:10:52,100
- You know what?

1341
01:10:52,100 --> 01:10:53,473
I don't need any of you.

1342
01:10:54,560 --> 01:10:56,047
I'm on to bigger and better things

1343
01:10:56,047 --> 01:10:58,213
and I can grow my man bun back!

1344
01:11:01,186 --> 01:11:03,853
(door slamming)

1345
01:11:11,070 --> 01:11:12,510
- I'm so sorry.

1346
01:11:12,510 --> 01:11:13,560
Everything is ruined.

1347
01:11:14,690 --> 01:11:16,463
- No daddy, it's not.

1348
01:11:17,410 --> 01:11:18,713
It's really not.

1349
01:11:21,310 --> 01:11:22,690
- Sir?

1350
01:11:22,690 --> 01:11:26,550
- Maria, how long have you known this guy?

1351
01:11:26,550 --> 01:11:27,383
- Not long.

1352
01:11:27,383 --> 01:11:28,250
We met accidentally.

1353
01:11:28,250 --> 01:11:30,000
- Well, I heard what my baby girl say

1354
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:32,150
about how much he loves her dad

1355
01:11:32,150 --> 01:11:35,093
and how she would do anything
for him to make him happy.

1356
01:11:37,490 --> 01:11:38,323
And you.

1357
01:11:39,701 --> 01:11:41,720
You talk very prudently.

1358
01:11:41,720 --> 01:11:43,030
I checked you out.

1359
01:11:43,030 --> 01:11:44,283
You kept focus.

1360
01:11:45,460 --> 01:11:47,050
Welcome to the family.

1361
01:11:47,050 --> 01:11:48,890
- Sir, I-
- No.

1362
01:11:48,890 --> 01:11:52,419
No need to find speeches,
just keep the focus

1363
01:11:52,419 --> 01:11:53,673
and we'll always agree.

1364
01:11:54,800 --> 01:11:57,705
- Daddy, thank you.

1365
01:11:57,705 --> 01:11:58,538
Thank you.

1366
01:12:00,567 --> 01:12:01,833
Can we have a minute?

1367
01:12:05,097 --> 01:12:05,930
Charlee.

1368
01:12:07,483 --> 01:12:08,816
- I am so sorry.

1369
01:12:12,610 --> 01:12:14,293
God, I'm such an idiot.

1370
01:12:15,940 --> 01:12:19,230
I didn't know you were engaged
until I got the invitations,

1371
01:12:19,230 --> 01:12:22,643
and then Dimple said everything
was going to be fine.

1372
01:12:22,643 --> 01:12:24,533
God, I should have told you.

1373
01:12:25,809 --> 01:12:27,290
I'm so ashamed.

1374
01:12:27,290 --> 01:12:28,140
- [Maria] I know.

1375
01:12:30,630 --> 01:12:32,560
- Sir, sir, excuse me.

1376
01:12:32,560 --> 01:12:35,250
My name is William Von Dumpling

1377
01:12:35,250 --> 01:12:38,323
and I would really,
really appreciate a ride.

1378
01:12:40,373 --> 01:12:43,750
Come here.

1379
01:12:43,750 --> 01:12:45,000
Here, hold this.

1380
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:46,473
And be careful, it's tailored.

1381
01:12:48,382 --> 01:12:51,215
(Dimple grunting)

1382
01:12:56,920 --> 01:12:59,110
See you later, losers!

1383
01:12:59,110 --> 01:13:02,363
You'll regret this, Maria! (laughs)

1384
01:13:05,530 --> 01:13:07,333
- Mr. Von Dumpling.

1385
01:13:14,250 --> 01:13:16,443
How about we settle your debts?

1386
01:13:19,561 --> 01:13:20,540
- Open the door.

1387
01:13:20,540 --> 01:13:21,476
Open the door.
- Drive.

1388
01:13:21,476 --> 01:13:22,355
- Open the door.

1389
01:13:22,355 --> 01:13:23,473
Open the door!

1390
01:13:23,473 --> 01:13:24,538
Open the door!

1391
01:13:24,538 --> 01:13:26,983
(screams) No, not that finger!

1392
01:13:26,983 --> 01:13:30,483
(screams) Not the finger!

1393
01:13:35,496 --> 01:13:38,579
(light guitar music)

1394
01:13:40,113 --> 01:13:42,226
- Even the Brit drives American.

1395
01:13:42,226 --> 01:13:43,930
(Jenny chuckles)

1396
01:13:43,930 --> 01:13:46,203
Oh, a real laugh?

1397
01:13:54,290 --> 01:13:56,840
- Nate, you're pretty funny
when you're not trying.

1398
01:13:58,140 --> 01:14:00,500
- What is that supposed to mean?

1399
01:14:00,500 --> 01:14:03,673
- It means you're charming when
you're just being yourself.

1400
01:14:04,609 --> 01:14:05,559
- [Nate] Thank you.

1401
01:14:07,433 --> 01:14:08,266
I guess.

1402
01:14:09,470 --> 01:14:10,670
- Now if I can just teach you how to sing

1403
01:14:10,670 --> 01:14:12,100
you'll be a 10.

1404
01:14:12,100 --> 01:14:15,890
Well, not a 10, close enough.

1405
01:14:15,890 --> 01:14:17,240
- Wow.

1406
01:14:17,240 --> 01:14:18,273
Are we rating guys now?

1407
01:14:18,273 --> 01:14:19,845
- Mhmm.

1408
01:14:19,845 --> 01:14:22,254
- I mean you could teach me how to sing.

1409
01:14:22,254 --> 01:14:23,893
As long as it isn't Yankee Doodle.

1410
01:14:25,200 --> 01:14:26,480
- You're right.

1411
01:14:26,480 --> 01:14:27,313
- I'll take it.

1412
01:14:29,754 --> 01:14:34,754

1413

1416
01:14:43,410 --> 01:14:46,080
- That went a lot better in my head.

1417
01:14:46,080 --> 01:14:48,383
- Henry, there's something I need to do.

1418
01:14:52,509 --> 01:14:54,490
Is that the Acme 10 gauge?

1419
01:14:54,490 --> 01:14:55,520
- Yeah.

1420
01:14:55,520 --> 01:14:56,353
- I'll take it.

1421
01:15:00,730 --> 01:15:02,640
- [Frank] I'm going to let her shoot it.

1422
01:15:02,640 --> 01:15:04,590
I've seen you shoot.

1423
01:15:04,590 --> 01:15:05,990
- I'm fine with that.

1424
01:15:05,990 --> 01:15:06,823
- Let's go.

1425
01:15:19,684 --> 01:15:20,517
Pull!

1426
01:15:21,525 --> 01:15:24,192
(rifle booming)

1427
01:15:26,210 --> 01:15:27,043
- Maria.

1428
01:15:27,910 --> 01:15:29,563
There's something I have to tell you.

1429
01:15:31,630 --> 01:15:33,123
I may be sent back overseas.

1430
01:15:37,200 --> 01:15:38,653
- Five words, soldier.

1431
01:15:39,860 --> 01:15:41,987
I will wait for you.

1432
01:15:44,530 --> 01:15:47,613
(light guitar music)

1433
01:16:18,322 --> 01:16:21,322

You do that, I will punch you in the face.

1441
01:16:50,840 --> 01:16:52,870
- Let's say we start Monday morning.

1442
01:16:54,680 --> 01:16:55,513
