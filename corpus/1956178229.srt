00:07:46,616 --> 00:07:48,750
I'm not stopping you.
I just want to talk to her.

167
00:07:48,752 --> 00:07:50,886
I don't want her talng
while she's giving me head.

168
00:07:50,888 --> 00:07:52,671
( screams )
Jesus.

169
00:07:52,673 --> 00:07:55,140
- ( spits )
- She's not giving you
diddly, man.

170
00:07:55,142 --> 00:07:58,226
We're just--
forget it, okay?!

171
00:07:58,228 --> 00:08:00,178
- ( laughs )
- Don't flatter yourself.

172
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:02,931
I wouldn't waste
my come on you.

173
00:08:10,941 --> 00:08:14,442
Tricks. They're so
predicable, you know?

174
00:08:14,444 --> 00:08:16,328
You get in the car
and you're his.

175
00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:18,246
( horn honks )

176
00:08:18,248 --> 00:08:20,949
<i> And never get in a van.</i>

177
00:08:22,703 --> 00:08:24,485
I made that mistake once.

178
00:08:24,487 --> 00:08:26,705
<i> ( man whistles )</i>

179
00:08:26,707 --> 00:08:28,507
Just once.

180
00:08:28,509 --> 00:08:30,992
It happened downtown
a couple of years ago.

181
00:08:30,994 --> 00:08:34,846
It was before I had a pimp
to take care of me.

182
00:08:36,850 --> 00:08:39,768
I guess my mind just wasn't
on my job that night.

183
00:08:45,192 --> 00:08:47,475
Man:
<i> Excuse me, miss.</i>

184
00:08:55,485 --> 00:08:57,619
You're a prostitute,
aren't you?

185
00:08:59,456 --> 00:09:02,123
No. I'm a wet dream
on legs.

186
00:09:04,578 --> 00:09:07,695
How-- how much
do you cost?

187
00:09:07,697 --> 00:09:10,665
What are you looking for?

188
00:09:12,302 --> 00:09:15,170
I don't know.
Something around $20.

189
00:09:17,424 --> 00:09:19,724
20 bucks won't buy
a porno tape.

190
00:09:19,726 --> 00:09:22,260
Double it
and I'll give you head.

191
00:09:22,262 --> 00:09:23,845
I give great head.

192
00:09:33,556 --> 00:09:36,157
All right. All right.
Get in.

193
00:09:41,748 --> 00:09:44,666
So you got a place
or you want it here?

194
00:09:44,668 --> 00:09:48,620
- ( screaming )
- Yeah!

195
00:09:48,622 --> 00:09:51,373
Come on, man!
Give her a good fucking for me!

196
00:09:51,375 --> 00:09:53,541
Fuck her up the ass! Yeah!

197
00:09:53,543 --> 00:09:55,743
Come on, man!
Do it for me, man!

198
00:09:55,745 --> 00:09:59,681
Stick it down her
fucking throat, man! Whoo!

199
00:09:59,683 --> 00:10:01,967

<i> There must have been</i>
<i> five of 'em.</i>

200
00:10:01,969 --> 00:10:04,719
<i> They started on me right away.</i>
<i> They were like animals.</i>

201
00:10:04,721 --> 00:10:07,105
<i> Just grunting and laughing.</i>
<i> Grunting and cussing.</i>

202
00:10:07,107 --> 00:10:08,974
- Yeah, come on, man!

204
00:10:11,194 --> 00:10:14,879
<i> When they had enough,</i>
<i> they-- they just got rid of me.</i>

205
00:10:14,881 --> 00:10:17,248
- Man:<i> Later, bitch!</i>
-<i> ( door shuts )</i>

206
00:10:55,322 --> 00:10:57,906
( whimpering )

207
00:11:00,243 --> 00:11:01,660
My God.

208
00:11:06,033 --> 00:11:07,949
Don't be afraid.

209
00:11:17,344 --> 00:11:20,545
Liz:
<i> Yeah, he offered me a ride</i>
<i> to the nearest hospital.</i>

210
00:11:20,547 --> 00:11:23,181
<i> I really should've gone,</i>

211
00:11:23,183 --> 00:11:26,051
<i> but the hospital</i>
<i> would've called the cops</i>

212
00:11:26,053 --> 00:11:28,687
<i> and I couldn't deal</i>
<i> with the cops.</i>

213
00:11:28,689 --> 00:11:31,106
<i> So I told him I had a fight</i>
<i> with my boyfriend</i>

214
00:11:31,108 --> 00:11:34,008
<i> and maybe he could</i>
<i> just take me home.</i>

215
00:11:34,010 --> 00:11:36,677
<i> Then he told me</i>
<i> he was a schoolteacher.</i>

216
00:11:36,679 --> 00:11:39,731
<i> Great, with my luck,</i>
<i> he'll molest me.</i>

217
00:11:39,733 --> 00:11:42,183
<i> He gave me his handkerchief</i>
<i> to wipe away the blood.</i>

218
00:11:42,185 --> 00:11:44,452
<i> The only thing he wanted</i>

219
00:11:44,454 --> 00:11:47,205
<i> was to know</i>
<i> if I needed anything.</i>

220
00:11:47,207 --> 00:11:49,574
<i> I hated asking,</i>

221
00:11:49,576 --> 00:11:51,993
<i> but I needed some money.</i>

222
00:11:51,995 --> 00:11:54,879
<i> He gave me 20 bucks,</i>
<i> his name, and his address.</i>

223
00:11:54,881 --> 00:11:57,298
<i> I guess he thought</i>
<i> he'd never see it again,</i>

224
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:59,867
<i> but I sent it back</i>
<i> with a new handkerchief</i>

225
00:11:59,869 --> 00:12:02,003
<i> and I wrote him</i>
<i> this little thank-you note.</i>

226
00:12:02,005 --> 00:12:04,872
<i> "Just a line to let you know</i>
<i> that I'm okay."</i>

227
00:12:04,874 --> 00:12:07,809
<i> But he never wrote back.</i>

228
00:12:07,811 --> 00:12:11,262
<i> One look at my spelling</i>
<i> would scare anybody off.</i>

229
00:12:11,264 --> 00:12:13,648
<i> Especially a schoolteacher,</i>
<i> you know?</i>

230
00:12:15,885 --> 00:12:17,986
<i> ( air rhythmically rushing )</i>

231
00:12:26,363 --> 00:12:28,196
Looks a little flat.

232
00:12:28,198 --> 00:12:31,116
Need a hand pumping it up?

233
00:12:31,118 --> 00:12:32,667
You are doing it

234
00:12:32,669 --> 00:12:34,502
without a rubber thing?

235
00:12:34,504 --> 00:12:36,704
I pay for it
without a rubber thing.

236
00:12:36,706 --> 00:12:39,207
You prefer what
without a rubber thing?

237
00:12:39,209 --> 00:12:42,577
- Everything.
- What are you, man,
like suicidal?

238
00:12:42,579 --> 00:12:44,846
Yes. I am
liking that, too.

239
00:12:44,848 --> 00:12:47,882
Well, I'm not into
suicides and I always use
a rubber thing.

240
00:12:47,884 --> 00:12:50,718
- I pay extra.
- You couldn't afford extra.

241

<i> ( siren blaring )</i>

242
00:12:58,395 --> 00:13:02,363
He wants it,
but he doesn't want
to use a rubber.

243
00:13:02,365 --> 00:13:04,816
Get a lot of men like that.

244
00:13:04,818 --> 00:13:07,786
I mean, they'll pay extra.
Sometimes even double.

245
00:13:07,788 --> 00:13:11,322
I mean,
that is really stupid.

246
00:13:11,324 --> 00:13:14,409
What if they took
something home to their wives?

247
00:13:16,279 --> 00:13:18,713
<i> Some of 'em never give up,</i>
<i> do they?</i>

248
00:13:18,715 --> 00:13:20,715
<i> Take Charlie for instance.</i>

249
00:13:20,717 --> 00:13:22,717
<i> Man was as good as gold.</i>

250
00:13:22,719 --> 00:13:25,887
<i> Charlie was a regular,</i>
<i> but he didn't want sex.</i>

251
00:13:25,889 --> 00:13:28,223
<i> Well, not straight sex</i>
<i> anyway.</i>

252
00:13:28,225 --> 00:13:30,925
<i> All I had to do</i>
<i> was hit him with his cane</i>
<i> and he'd come.</i>

253
00:13:30,927 --> 00:13:33,394
<i> First time, I got a little</i>
<i> carried away.</i>

254
00:13:33,396 --> 00:13:35,180
<i> Bam. Oops.</i>

255
00:13:35,182 --> 00:13:37,732
<i> Then I found out</i>
<i> just how hard he liked it.</i>

256
00:13:37,734 --> 00:13:41,236
<i> It's funny.</i>
<i> The first time I saw him</i>
<i> all stretched out on the bed</i>

257
00:13:41,238 --> 00:13:44,606
<i> with his skinny</i>

<i> and his wrinkled little butt,</i>

258

<i> peed my pants.</i>

259
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:49,777
<i> Just six swats.</i>
<i> That was all he needed.</i>

260
00:13:49,779 --> 00:13:51,779
<i> Easy money.</i>

261
00:13:51,781 --> 00:13:53,698
<i> I must have</i>
<i> a talent for it.</i>

262
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:55,583
<i> I should open up</i>
<i> a torture chamber.</i>

263
00:13:55,585 --> 00:13:57,752
<i> I make him beg for mercy.</i>

264
00:13:57,754 --> 00:13:59,204
<i> There was this</i>
<i> one day, right,</i>

265
00:13:59,206 --> 00:14:00,872
<i> his grandchildren</i>

266
00:14:00,874 --> 00:14:02,823
<i> He told them I was from</i>
<i> the welfare department.</i>

267
00:14:02,825 --> 00:14:04,509
<i> That he had to show me</i>
<i> around the house.</i>

268
00:14:04,511 --> 00:14:07,212
<i> We left the kids watching TV</i>
<i> and we went upstairs.</i>

269
00:14:07,214 --> 00:14:10,014
<i> We couldn't do it</i>
<i> in the bedroom 'cause</i>
<i> the lock was broke.</i>

270
00:14:10,016 --> 00:14:11,999
<i> So we did it</i>
<i> in the bathroom,</i>

271
00:14:12,001 --> 00:14:14,686
<i> but I couldn't get</i>
<i> a good swing.</i>

272
00:14:14,688 --> 00:14:16,437
<i> It was just too narrow.</i>

-<i> ( Liz laughs )</i>

274
00:14:18,808 --> 00:14:21,125

275
00:14:23,346 --> 00:14:26,397
<i> He was so sweet.</i>
<i> He always gave me something.</i>

276
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:28,366
<i> I mean, you know,</i>
<i> besides the money.</i>

277
00:14:28,368 --> 00:14:31,319
<i> Usually something</i>

278
00:14:31,321 --> 00:14:33,905
<i> I know it's stupid to get</i>
<i> involved with tricks,</i>

329
00:18:16,913 --> 00:18:18,746
Give me a dry martini,
please.

330
00:18:18,748 --> 00:18:20,848
Very dry with a cherry.

331
00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:22,583
Not an olive.

332
00:18:22,585 --> 00:18:24,635
( panting )

333
00:18:24,637 --> 00:18:28,723
He doesn't really think
I'm gonna leave him.

334
00:18:28,725 --> 00:18:30,892
Hey, I know what he thinks.

335
00:18:30,894 --> 00:18:33,060
He thinks I'm still
gonna work.

336
00:18:33,062 --> 00:18:36,447
Like I said,
I left my place yesterday,

337
00:18:36,449 --> 00:18:39,400
I went and got this
little motel room.

338
00:18:39,402 --> 00:18:41,652
And see,
what he thinks is

339
00:18:41,654 --> 00:18:43,771
is that I've been
stacking my money, right?

340
00:18:43,773 --> 00:18:45,206
And in a couple of days,

341
00:18:45,208 --> 00:18:47,575
I'm gonna have this
big bankroll for him.

342
00:18:47,577 --> 00:18:49,210
( scoffs )

343
00:18:49,212 --> 00:18:51,612
That's what he thinks,
but I'm not.

344
00:18:51,614 --> 00:18:53,581
No. Not this time.

345
00:18:55,117 --> 00:18:57,218
I've been spending my money.

346
00:19:07,730 --> 00:19:09,514
Oh.

347
00:19:09,516 --> 00:19:11,432
Look at my nails.

348
00:19:11,434 --> 00:19:14,569
I used to have
beautiful nails.

349
00:19:16,439 --> 00:19:18,105
Now I can't leave them alone.

350
00:19:18,107 --> 00:19:20,691
I'm like a dog with a bone.

351
00:19:22,645 --> 00:19:25,279
See, pimps, you know,

352
00:19:25,281 --> 00:19:29,149
they think that they got
this hold on you, you know?

353
00:19:29,151 --> 00:19:32,119
Like you'll stick to them
like fucking crazy glue.

354
00:19:34,924 --> 00:19:37,091
And it is kinda crazy,
you know?

355
00:19:37,093 --> 00:19:40,178
In some sort of sick,
twisted way, they...

356
00:19:42,164 --> 00:19:44,849
they make you believe
that you love 'em.

361

362
00:20:06,022 --> 00:20:07,905

Um, hey.

366
00:20:14,363 --> 00:20:16,380
Do you think we could sit
at a different table?

367
00:20:16,382 --> 00:20:18,499
I mean, I got this
problem with kitchens.

368
00:20:18,501 --> 00:20:20,968
I used to work at this
greasy spoon, you know,

369
00:20:20,970 --> 00:20:22,837
and it was just
crawling with roaches.

370
00:20:22,839 --> 00:20:24,755
Ahem. Well,
it's your night.

371
00:20:26,676 --> 00:20:29,227
I understand, ma'am.
Please, follow me.

372
00:20:29,229 --> 00:20:31,712
Oh, but I didn't mean

373
00:20:31,714 --> 00:20:33,547
your kitchen was crawling
with roaches, too.

374
00:20:33,549 --> 00:20:36,017
It's just that I get this,
what do you call it?

375
00:20:36,019 --> 00:20:38,853
A phobia about it.
Yeah, that's it.

376
00:20:43,276 --> 00:20:45,910
Liz:
<i> I felt kinda nervous.</i>

377
00:20:45,912 --> 00:20:48,996

378
00:20:48,998 --> 00:20:50,731
<i> I didn't think</i>
<i> I could be promoted</i>

379
00:20:50,733 --> 00:20:52,917
<i> and I wondered if a whore</i>
<i> could be fired.</i>

380
00:20:52,919 --> 00:20:54,902

381
00:20:54,904 --> 00:20:57,872
<i> and bought me</i>
<i> that classy new dress,</i>
<i> would he?</i>

382
00:20:59,709 --> 00:21:02,927
So now you gonna tell me
what the occasion is?

383
00:21:04,881 --> 00:21:06,380
So what do you want to eat?

384
00:21:07,717 --> 00:21:09,517
( sighs )

385
00:21:09,519 --> 00:21:12,687
A steak.
I'm so hungry,
I could eat a horse.

386
00:21:12,689 --> 00:21:15,222
<i> 10-1 it is one, huh?</i>

387
00:21:15,224 --> 00:21:17,275
Steak "tarter."

388
00:21:17,277 --> 00:21:19,527
Yeah, this is a nice place,

389
00:21:19,529 --> 00:21:21,812
but you'd think they'd know
how to spell steak, huh?

390
00:21:21,814 --> 00:21:24,699
- S-T-E-K-E--
- This is a French restaurant.

391
00:21:26,369 --> 00:21:29,704
Then how come there's no
French fries on the menu, huh?

392
00:21:31,207 --> 00:21:33,324
They call 'em pommes frites.

393
00:21:34,744 --> 00:21:36,443
Oh.

394
00:21:36,445 --> 00:21:38,245
Well, I'll have
a helping of that

395
00:21:38,247 --> 00:21:39,580
and a nice, juicy steak.

396
00:21:39,582 --> 00:21:43,050
Steak tartare
is raw steak

397
00:21:43,052 --> 00:21:45,086
minced with
raw onions, eggs,

398
00:21:45,088 --> 00:21:47,672
and Worcestershire sauce.

399
00:21:49,125 --> 00:21:52,393
Oh. Really?

400
00:21:52,395 --> 00:21:55,796
Well, why don't you make
a suggestion, then, huh?

401
00:21:55,798 --> 00:21:57,598
All right.

402
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:00,985
As a starter,
how 'bout gravlax marinade?

403
00:22:03,573 --> 00:22:04,689
What's that?

404
00:22:04,691 --> 00:22:07,358
It's raw salmon
and it's marinade--

405
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:09,977
Raw?
Is everything in
this restaurant raw?

406
00:22:09,979 --> 00:22:11,996
I mean, can't they afford
a chef around here?

407
00:22:11,998 --> 00:22:15,082
Hey, raw food
is really good for you.
Don't you know nothin'?

408
00:22:15,084 --> 00:22:17,317
( speaks French )

409
00:22:17,319 --> 00:22:20,087
He wants you
to choose.

410
00:22:20,089 --> 00:22:22,256
( laughs )

411
00:22:22,258 --> 00:22:24,125
What, you found
something?

412
00:22:24,127 --> 00:22:26,660
What's so funny about
crab julienne?

413
00:22:26,662 --> 00:22:29,096
You remember.
Your old whore Julienne.

414
00:22:29,098 --> 00:22:31,132
She had crabs
like you wouldn't believe.

415
00:22:31,134 --> 00:22:33,300
- You remember.
- Uh, yes, madam?

416
00:22:35,355 --> 00:22:38,005
- I don't really know, sir.
- Hey, call him waiter.

417
00:22:38,007 --> 00:22:40,558
You call me sir.

418
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:42,443
I'll order
for both of us.

419
00:22:42,445 --> 00:22:45,312
<i> Très bien,</i> sir.

420
00:22:45,314 --> 00:22:47,698
We'll have the calamar
a la chinoise.

421
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:49,567
And would<i> sir</i>
care for some wine?

422
00:22:49,569 --> 00:22:52,203
Hey, can we get
some champagne?

423
00:22:52,205 --> 00:22:55,456
I haven't had champagne
for a long time.

424
00:22:55,458 --> 00:22:59,410
Give me a bottle
of "Low Da Vici."
Very cold.

425
00:22:59,412 --> 00:23:04,081
I presume<i> sir</i> means
"Eau De Vichy."

426
00:23:04,083 --> 00:23:05,499
Yeah, that's what I said.

427
00:23:07,503 --> 00:23:10,054
So now you gonna tell me
what this is all about?

428
00:23:15,845 --> 00:23:17,311
Madam
has a request?

429
00:23:17,313 --> 00:23:19,263
I have an extensive
repertoire.

430
00:23:19,265 --> 00:23:22,149
Uh, how 'bout "Don't It
Make My Brown Eyes Blue"?

431
00:23:22,151 --> 00:23:25,269
I'm afraid
I'm not that familiar with
the contemporary classics.

432
00:23:25,271 --> 00:23:28,155
- Of course not.
- How 'bout the march
from act three

433
00:23:28,157 --> 00:23:29,907
of Wagner's
"Lohengrin"?

434
00:23:29,909 --> 00:23:31,742
I think you mean
act two.

435
00:23:43,039 --> 00:23:45,923
I was wondering when we
were gonna get together,

436
00:23:45,925 --> 00:23:50,077
- but is this like
a proposal or something?
- "Something," my ass.

437
00:23:50,079 --> 00:23:51,929
Don't say you didn't
remember our anniversary.

438
00:23:51,931 --> 00:23:53,597
I've been looking
after you a year now.

439
00:23:53,599 --> 00:23:55,182
A year this very day.

440
00:23:55,184 --> 00:23:57,435
- C'est bon, sir?
- You may pour.

441
00:24:11,067 --> 00:24:13,951
- To our anniversary.
- And the oldest profession.

442
00:24:13,953 --> 00:24:16,821
- The what?
- Ahem.

443
00:24:16,823 --> 00:24:18,706
Uh, prostitution

444
00:24:18,708 --> 00:24:20,774
is commonly known
as the oldest profession.

445
00:24:20,776 --> 00:24:24,578
It sure makes me feel old.
I'll drink to that.

446
00:24:26,582 --> 00:24:29,049
This tastes
exactly like water.

447
00:24:29,051 --> 00:24:31,618
<i> It's sparkling mineral water.</i>
<i> It's good for the liver.</i>

448
00:24:31,620 --> 00:24:34,338
You oughta lay off the booze.
It's got a lot of calories.

449
00:24:34,340 --> 00:24:35,756
- No, put it out.
- Hmm?

450
00:24:35,758 --> 00:24:37,758
We're in a nonsmoking area.
Put it out.

451
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:39,810
Well, why don't we move
to a smoking area, then?

452
00:24:39,812 --> 00:24:42,296
You wanna take care of yourself?
Smoking is bad for your health.

453
00:24:42,298 --> 00:24:44,265
So is fucking
scabby tricks.

454
00:24:44,267 --> 00:24:47,351
And what is this?

455
00:24:47,353 --> 00:24:50,020
It's calamari and lychees.
What's it look like?

456
00:24:50,022 --> 00:24:52,740
I don't know,
but I've seen one
before, I think.

457
00:24:55,027 --> 00:24:56,410
What is calamar?

458
00:24:56,412 --> 00:24:58,662
It's a kind of octopus,
you stupid moron.

459
00:24:58,664 --> 00:25:00,531
It's fucking octopus.

460
00:25:00,533 --> 00:25:03,033
Ha! I should've known.
They got testicles, don't they?

461
00:25:03,035 --> 00:25:06,003
Though I thought they
had eight of 'em. Looks like
you've been shortchanged.

462
00:25:07,507 --> 00:25:08,873
Looks like a dick.

463
00:25:14,714 --> 00:25:16,597

Tastes like a dick.

<i> Look, all I want is just</i>

of apple pie with loads
of ice cream on it!

466
00:25:22,522 --> 00:25:24,438
- Yeah, well, forget it!
- What-- what you say?!

467
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:25,890
What, have you gone deaf?
I said forget it!

468

So are diamonds,
but they're a lot less painful.

496
00:26:59,735 --> 00:27:02,286
That's the most pricks

00:27:08,744 --> 00:27:11,412

501

502
00:27:16,552 --> 00:27:18,469

503

505
00:27:24,343 --> 00:27:27,761

506
00:27:28,981 --> 00:27:31,015
It's kinda like
being a hostage.

507
00:27:31,017 --> 00:27:34,151
They just know how
to make you need 'em.

508
00:27:36,022 --> 00:27:37,738
They don't love you.

509
00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:39,657
Pimps don't love nobody.

510
00:27:39,659 --> 00:27:42,660
Give me another martini,
please.

511
00:27:44,413 --> 00:27:46,113
Air dry.

512
00:27:47,416 --> 00:27:49,583
Getting as bad as Bill was.

513
00:27:49,585 --> 00:27:51,285
Fuck it.

514

516
00:27:58,177 --> 00:28:00,678
<i> It was back home</i>

517
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:02,496
<i> where they had</i>
<i> music and beer</i>

518
00:28:02,498 --> 00:28:04,831
<i> and you could hang out</i>
<i> and shoot pool.</i>

519
00:28:04,833 --> 00:28:07,167

520
00:28:07,169 --> 00:28:09,937

521
00:28:09,939 --> 00:28:12,356
- I feel like I'm gonna die.
- Put your bet on him.

522
00:28:12,358 --> 00:28:15,275
- Think I should?
- What's a buck?
Yeah, you're right.

523
00:28:15,277 --> 00:28:17,227
But don't you think
it will look kinda weird,
me going over there

524
00:28:17,229 --> 00:28:19,229
and putting money down
right in front of him?

525
00:28:19,231 --> 00:28:21,065
No, he'll just think
you're some horny bar slut

526
00:28:21,067 --> 00:28:24,368
- that wants to fuck him.
- Stop.

527
00:28:24,370 --> 00:28:26,019
What if I want
to marry him?

528
00:28:26,021 --> 00:28:28,322
Then I think
I better bet on him.

529
00:28:33,462 --> 00:28:36,196

- You think so?

Yeah. Hey, you shouldn't put
your talents down, you know?

543
00:29:40,479 --> 00:29:44,531
It's an inherited talent.
My old man's a big drinker.

- Really? So is mine.
- No kidding?

Chef Pierre is gone

- Ripe.

"What do you like doing?"

659
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:14,264
I don't know.
I like watching TV.

660
00:37:14,266 --> 00:37:16,983
( lowered )
"No, not that.
What am I doing to you?"

661
00:37:16,985 --> 00:37:18,768
"What you doing to me?"

662
00:37:18,770 --> 00:37:21,855
( lowered )
"Yeah. Tell me, tell me.
What am I doing to you?"

663
00:37:23,992 --> 00:37:25,558
I was still young.

664
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:27,911
I didn't know what
they wanted me to say.

665
00:37:27,913 --> 00:37:30,030
Now when they ask,

666
00:37:30,032 --> 00:37:31,865
I know what they want.

667
00:37:31,867 --> 00:37:35,085
As soon as they
get their dick out
and ask me if I like it.

668
00:37:35,087 --> 00:37:36,703
I whisper to them,

669
00:37:36,705 --> 00:37:39,405
"Oh, honey,
it's a beautiful cock.

670
00:37:39,407 --> 00:37:41,591
It's so big and hard."

671
00:37:41,593 --> 00:37:45,078
( lowered )
"What do you want me
to do with it," they'd say.

672
00:37:45,080 --> 00:37:47,631
I'd love to
really tell 'em.

673
00:37:47,633 --> 00:37:49,082
But instead, I say,

674
00:37:49,084 --> 00:37:51,017
"Oh, my pussy's
really hungry

675
00:37:51,019 --> 00:37:52,719
for your big,
hard cock.

676
00:37:52,721 --> 00:37:55,605
Come on, give it to me.
Give it to me."

677
00:37:57,025 --> 00:37:58,441
Yeah.

678
00:38:00,479 --> 00:38:03,563
But then there
are those who want to do
the talking themselves.

679
00:38:05,033 --> 00:38:07,317
I mean, talk dirty.

680
00:38:07,319 --> 00:38:09,369
<i> Sometimes it feels</i>
<i> like they just--</i>

681
00:38:09,371 --> 00:38:11,404
<i> they just want</i>
<i> to rip you open.</i>

682
00:38:11,406 --> 00:38:14,124
Hey, be a little
gentle, huh?

683
00:38:14,126 --> 00:38:15,959
Shut your fucking trap.

684
00:38:15,961 --> 00:38:18,161
Liz:
<i> So I just shut up</i>
<i> and let 'em do their thing.</i>

685
00:38:18,163 --> 00:38:19,796
<i> I close my eyes.</i>

686
00:38:19,798 --> 00:38:21,915
<i> I don't want to see</i>
<i> the hate in their faces.</i>

687
00:38:25,587 --> 00:38:28,138
They must have
terrible lives.

688
00:38:28,140 --> 00:38:30,390
The men, I mean.

689
00:38:30,392 --> 00:38:34,060
Something must have happened
to 'em to make 'em like that.

690
00:38:34,062 --> 00:38:36,262
They weren't born that way,
were they?

691
00:38:38,466 --> 00:38:41,935
Maybe they're
henpecked at home.

692
00:38:44,489 --> 00:38:46,356
Or bossed around at work

693
00:38:46,358 --> 00:38:49,693
so they feel humiliated.

694
00:38:49,695 --> 00:38:52,195
They want to humiliate
somebody back.

695
00:38:52,197 --> 00:38:54,614
Makes 'em feel better.

696
00:38:55,784 --> 00:38:57,784
More important.

697
00:38:57,786 --> 00:39:00,086
It's nothing personal.

698
00:39:00,088 --> 00:39:02,038
I know that.

699
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:06,009
They don't even want sex,
you know.

700
00:39:06,011 --> 00:39:08,294
It's more like...

701
00:39:08,296 --> 00:39:10,764
like revenge.

702
00:39:13,168 --> 00:39:15,018
Yeah.

703
00:39:15,020 --> 00:39:17,303
That's it.

704
00:39:18,523 --> 00:39:21,024
They only want revenge.

705
00:39:26,347 --> 00:39:27,981
<i> ( water running )</i>

706
00:39:37,042 --> 00:39:38,658
( man moaning )

707
00:39:40,879 --> 00:39:43,380
I feel sorry
for their wives.

708
00:39:43,382 --> 00:39:47,217
Most of the men
who come in here
must be married.

709
00:39:47,219 --> 00:39:49,302
And they come here

710
00:39:49,304 --> 00:39:51,087
because we'll do
the things

711
00:39:51,089 --> 00:39:53,206
their wives
and girlfriends
won't do.

712
00:39:53,208 --> 00:39:56,876
Head. That's what
most of 'em ask for.

713
00:39:56,878 --> 00:40:00,146
I mean,
I don't see why

714
00:40:00,148 --> 00:40:01,598
a woman would have
a problem

715
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:04,050
with sticking
her man's cock
in her mouth?

716
00:40:04,052 --> 00:40:06,352
I mean,
I guarantee you

717
00:40:06,354 --> 00:40:08,438
if he ain't sticking it
in her mouth,

718
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:11,191
he'll be sticking it
in somebody else's.

719
00:40:11,193 --> 00:40:13,493
Could be hers,
could be mine.

720
00:40:13,495 --> 00:40:15,745
We're substitutes.

721
00:40:15,747 --> 00:40:17,497
I bet you

722
00:40:17,499 --> 00:40:19,232
<i> he's got his eyes shut</i>

723
00:40:19,234 --> 00:40:21,534
<i> thinking of his wife</i>
<i> right now.</i>

724
00:40:21,536 --> 00:40:24,087
( moaning continues )

725
00:40:24,089 --> 00:40:26,372
Me?

726
00:40:26,374 --> 00:40:30,126
I don't wanna see another dick
as long as I live.

727
00:40:30,128 --> 00:40:32,846
Ugh.

728
00:40:32,848 --> 00:40:34,347
( sighs )

729
00:40:34,349 --> 00:40:36,916
I've lost count
of how many I've had.

730
00:40:36,918 --> 00:40:38,918
Must be miles.

731
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:40,804
<i> ( moaning continues )</i>

732
00:40:44,025 --> 00:40:45,942
I used to love sex.

733
00:40:47,479 --> 00:40:49,612
I used to love
everything about it.

734
00:40:51,116 --> 00:40:52,565
Now when I go to bed,

735
00:40:52,567 --> 00:40:55,568
all I want to do
is go to sleep.

736
00:40:55,570 --> 00:40:58,788
And I bet you
I've had more sex
in places like this

737
00:40:58,790 --> 00:41:01,374
than I've ever had
in a bed.

738
00:41:01,376 --> 00:41:03,109
I should write
a book about it--

739
00:41:03,111 --> 00:41:05,128
"The Toilets
I Have Known."

740
00:41:07,632 --> 00:41:09,966
I met my best friend
in one.

741
00:41:12,387 --> 00:41:14,420
Well, she was.

742
00:41:15,957 --> 00:41:17,456
<i> I was working downtown.</i>

743
00:41:17,458 --> 00:41:19,142
<i> Hanging around</i>
<i> looking for tricks</i>

744
00:41:19,144 --> 00:41:21,460
<i> when this girl comes along</i>
<i> acting like she's stoned</i>

745
00:41:21,462 --> 00:41:23,462
<i> or drunk or something.</i>

746
00:41:23,464 --> 00:41:25,515
<i> And then I see the blood</i>
<i> and I just look at her</i>

747
00:41:25,517 --> 00:41:27,400
<i> and I say,</i>
<i> "What the fuck?"</i>

748
00:41:27,402 --> 00:41:29,352
<i> And she just says, "Blake."</i>

749
00:41:29,354 --> 00:41:30,937
<i> And I see the bastard</i>
<i> had cut her</i>

750
00:41:30,939 --> 00:41:33,022
<i> right across the stomach.</i>
<i> And then I thought,</i>

751
00:41:33,024 --> 00:41:35,608
<i> "If I don't do something fast,</i>
<i> she's gonna bleed to death."</i>

752
00:41:35,610 --> 00:41:37,744
<i> So I go rushing her</i>
<i> into the theater</i>

753
00:41:37,746 --> 00:41:40,079
<i> and I yell to</i>
<i> the chick in the box,</i>
<i> "Get an ambulance."</i>

754
00:41:40,081 --> 00:41:42,615
<i> I guess she must have</i>
<i> just got the manager</i>

755
00:41:42,617 --> 00:41:46,336
<i> 'cause after a while,</i>
<i> this bitch comes busting in</i>
<i> and starts laying into us.</i>

756
00:41:46,338 --> 00:41:48,505
<i> Calling us dirty,</i>
<i> filthy sluts.</i>

757
00:41:48,507 --> 00:41:51,708
<i> And I'm trying to stop</i>
<i> the blood, but it just won't</i>
<i> fucking stop.</i>

758
00:41:51,710 --> 00:41:53,659
<i> And the poor girl,</i>
<i> she's starting to go</i>
<i> into shock</i>

759
00:41:53,661 --> 00:41:55,512
<i> and the manager's</i>
<i> yelling at us</i>

760
00:41:55,514 --> 00:41:57,663
<i> about AIDS and trying</i>
<i> to kick us out.</i>

761
00:41:57,665 --> 00:41:59,716
<i> Without getting too close,</i>
<i> of course.</i>

762
00:41:59,718 --> 00:42:01,684
<i> But the blood</i>
<i> just kept coming.</i>

763
00:42:01,686 --> 00:42:03,853
<i> And then in comes Katie.</i>

764
00:42:03,855 --> 00:42:06,472
<i> She sorta took control</i>
<i> right away, you know.</i>

765
00:42:06,474 --> 00:42:08,641
<i> I mean, even got</i>
<i> the manager to help out.</i>

766
00:42:08,643 --> 00:42:10,894
<i> She told her to imagine</i>
<i> it was her daughter.</i>

767
00:42:26,545 --> 00:42:28,211
<i> If it wasn't for Katie,</i>

768
00:42:28,213 --> 00:42:30,213
<i> I don't think the girl</i>
<i> would've pulled through.</i>

769
00:42:30,215 --> 00:42:32,882
<i> Katie wanted to know why</i>
<i> she didn't go to the cops.</i>

770
00:42:32,884 --> 00:42:34,584
<i> I laughed.</i>

771
00:42:34,586 --> 00:42:37,536
<i> I told her Blake pays the cops</i>
<i> to look the other way.</i>

772
00:42:37,538 --> 00:42:40,039
<i> Anyway, he got her</i>
<i> a few weeks later,</i>

773
00:42:40,041 --> 00:42:42,592
<i> but this time, the knife</i>
<i> went straight through.</i>

774
00:42:42,594 --> 00:42:45,211
<i> That was a terrible week.</i>

775
00:42:45,213 --> 00:42:48,681
<i> I don't know what the hell</i>
<i> I would've done without Katie.</i>

776
00:42:48,683 --> 00:42:51,684
<i> She looked after me</i>
<i> like a sister would.</i>

777
00:42:51,686 --> 00:42:53,903
<i> If I would've had one.</i>

778
00:42:53,905 --> 00:42:57,156
<i> Sometimes I wonder why</i>
<i> my parents ever had me.</i>

779
00:42:57,158 --> 00:42:59,325
<i> They must've been drunk.</i>

780
00:42:59,327 --> 00:43:01,911
<i> I guess I was why</i>
<i> Dad left home.</i>

781
00:43:03,698 --> 00:43:05,564
<i> Katie was the only person</i>

782
00:43:05,566 --> 00:43:08,167
<i> I ever knew</i>
<i> that never wanted.</i>

783
00:43:08,169 --> 00:43:10,119
<i> I wanted.</i>
<i> I needed.</i>

784
00:43:10,121 --> 00:43:14,073
<i> There were nights I needed</i>
<i> so badly just to be held.</i>

785
00:43:14,075 --> 00:43:15,758
<i> For my birthday,</i>

786
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:17,576
<i> Katie bought me a book.</i>

787
00:43:17,578 --> 00:43:19,596
<i> Nobody ever gave me</i>
<i> a book before.</i>

788
00:43:19,598 --> 00:43:21,497
<i> It's called</i>
<i> "Animal Farm"</i>

789
00:43:21,499 --> 00:43:23,850
<i> and I'm telling you,</i>
<i> it's just like life.</i>

790
00:43:23,852 --> 00:43:26,469
<i> It's about animals,</i>
<i> but it's not for kids.</i>

791
00:43:26,471 --> 00:43:29,138
<i> It's the best book</i>
<i> I ever read.</i>

792
00:43:29,140 --> 00:43:32,058
<i> Well, it's the only book</i>
<i> I ever read.</i>

793
00:43:32,060 --> 00:43:34,927
<i> And on the inside cover</i>
<i> she wrote,</i>

794
00:43:34,929 --> 00:43:36,613
<i> "To Liz</i>

795
00:43:36,615 --> 00:43:40,033
<i> with love and all</i>
<i> beautiful things.</i>
<i> K."</i>

796
00:43:40,035 --> 00:43:43,903
<i> Sometimes I used to open it</i>
<i> just to read that.</i>

797
00:43:43,905 --> 00:43:46,789
<i> I just loved</i>
<i> being with her.</i>

798
00:43:46,791 --> 00:43:48,758
<i> She even turned me on</i>

799
00:43:48,760 --> 00:43:50,994
<i> to serious music</i>
<i> for a while.</i>

800
00:43:52,998 --> 00:43:54,914
<i> ( music playing )</i>

801
00:44:12,633 --> 00:44:14,233
<i> She was so smart.</i>

802
00:44:14,235 --> 00:44:17,470
<i> She could make almost anything</i>
<i> sound interesting.</i>

803
00:44:17,472 --> 00:44:18,971
<i> Katie worked as a bartender.</i>

804
00:44:18,973 --> 00:44:21,407
<i> She made good money,</i>
<i> but what a waste.</i>

805
00:44:21,409 --> 00:44:23,192
<i> I mean, she went</i>
<i> to junior college.</i>

806
00:44:23,194 --> 00:44:25,745
<i> I kept telling her</i>
<i> she should get a good job</i>

807
00:44:25,747 --> 00:44:27,646
<i> like a teacher or something.</i>

808
00:44:27,648 --> 00:44:30,450
<i> She'd make a great teacher.</i>

809
00:44:30,452 --> 00:44:32,452
<i> God, I wish</i>
<i> I had her brains.</i>

810
00:44:32,454 --> 00:44:34,087
<i> And I told her that.</i>

811
00:44:34,089 --> 00:44:35,788
<i> She said there's</i>
<i> nothing wrong with my brain,</i>

812
00:44:35,790 --> 00:44:37,590
<i> only my education.</i>

813
00:44:37,592 --> 00:44:39,425
<i> My education?</i>

814
00:44:39,427 --> 00:44:40,793
<i> That can't be right</i>

815
00:44:40,795 --> 00:44:42,762
<i> 'cause I hardly</i>
<i> finished school.</i>

816
00:44:42,764 --> 00:44:45,214
<i> I mean, I haven't been</i>
<i> in school for so long</i>

817
00:44:45,216 --> 00:44:47,350
<i> that I can't even</i>
<i> remember anything.</i>

818
00:45:38,486 --> 00:45:39,902
<i> ( man moaning )</i>

819
00:45:39,904 --> 00:45:42,271
<i> That was the end</i>
<i> of Katie and me.</i>

820
00:45:42,273 --> 00:45:43,906
<i> ( woman smacking lips )</i>

821
00:45:46,745 --> 00:45:49,495
Sharp as a razor.

822
00:45:49,497 --> 00:45:51,414
And I'd use it, too.

823
00:45:52,733 --> 00:45:55,501
Once I'd use it on myself.

824
00:45:55,503 --> 00:45:57,503
But now I'd fight back.

825
00:45:57,505 --> 00:46:00,173
That's Katie.

826

<i> ( man moaning louder )</i>

827
00:46:10,185 --> 00:46:13,686
Huh. Dignity.

829
00:46:58,433 --> 00:47:00,266
Oh, it's you.

830
00:47:00,268 --> 00:47:02,185
You suddenly takin'
a liking to rubbers?

831
00:47:02,187 --> 00:47:05,154
I thought you might have
taken a disliking to them.

832
00:47:05,156 --> 00:47:07,573
- Not on your life.
- But I'm exceedingly clean.

833
00:47:07,575 --> 00:47:09,308
I'm sure you are.

834
00:47:09,310 --> 00:47:10,860
But look, it's no use
sitting there

835
00:47:10,862 --> 00:47:12,195
because I'm not
gonna change my mind.

836
00:47:12,197 --> 00:47:14,313
I don't care
how much you pay me.

837
00:47:14,315 --> 00:47:16,815
And I'm not gonna do
any business with you
sitting here either,

838
00:47:16,817 --> 00:47:19,202
so why don't you
just fuck off?

839
00:47:19,204 --> 00:47:21,320
And take your
little horn with you.

840
00:47:21,322 --> 00:47:23,289
( horn honks )

841
00:47:27,045 --> 00:47:29,178
Why do you insist
upon a rubber?

842
00:47:29,180 --> 00:47:32,765
Crabs, clap, syphilis,
herpes, AIDS, chlamydia.

843
00:47:32,767 --> 00:47:34,800
Is that enough for you
or do you want more?

844
00:47:34,802 --> 00:47:36,719
I mean, with all that,

845
00:47:36,721 --> 00:47:39,272
what could you possibly have
against a rubber, huh?

846
00:47:39,274 --> 00:47:41,307
It's not that I have
anything against them.

847
00:47:41,309 --> 00:47:44,977
It's just that they are
usually too small for me.

848
00:47:49,684 --> 00:47:51,400
You gotta be kidding.

849
00:47:51,402 --> 00:47:54,186
No. I am not.

850
00:47:54,188 --> 00:47:56,572
I have a very stout
member.

851
00:47:56,574 --> 00:47:58,791
( laughs )

852
00:47:58,793 --> 00:48:00,910
Well, that's the best news
I've heard all day.

853
00:48:00,912 --> 00:48:03,713
I'm thrilled for you.
Congratulations.

854
00:48:03,715 --> 00:48:05,631
Thank you.

855
00:48:05,633 --> 00:48:07,866
But the pleasure is yours.

856
00:48:07,868 --> 00:48:09,752
Oh, Jesus.

857
00:48:09,754 --> 00:48:12,037
You guys still believe
that shit, don't you?

858
00:48:12,039 --> 00:48:15,207
"In a recent
nationwide survey,

859
00:48:15,209 --> 00:48:17,393
eight out of 10 prostitutes
who expressed preference

860
00:48:17,395 --> 00:48:20,513
said that their vagina
preferred small 'members.'"

861
00:48:20,515 --> 00:48:23,566
It sounds like it turns you on,
but it does nothing for me.

862
00:48:23,568 --> 00:48:25,484
<i> Comprende?</i>

863
00:48:29,557 --> 00:48:31,056
It's the cops.

864
00:48:31,058 --> 00:48:33,359
I suggest you get
the hell outta here.

865
00:48:33,361 --> 00:48:35,528
You go down the street
and then you hang a left.

866
00:48:35,530 --> 00:48:38,281
You go onto the freeway
there and it's right there
on your right.

867
00:48:38,283 --> 00:48:40,917
You can't miss it.
The gas station is
open all night.

868
00:48:40,919 --> 00:48:43,369
Uh-huh. Thank you.
You are most kind.

869
00:48:43,371 --> 00:48:45,121
You're welcome.

870
00:48:45,123 --> 00:48:47,506
Come here,
sweetheart.

871
00:48:58,219 --> 00:49:00,553
Now then, you have
two choices, honey.

872
00:49:01,973 --> 00:49:03,773
You can haul ass
yourself

873
00:49:03,775 --> 00:49:05,858
or we haul you off
and take you in.

874
00:49:05,860 --> 00:49:07,893
Yes, sir.

875
00:49:07,895 --> 00:49:11,447
Sorry, sir.
Really, sir.

876
00:49:11,449 --> 00:49:13,232
were you gonna have me
jog alongside of you

877
00:49:13,234 --> 00:49:15,284
or were you gonna
cuff me to your spoke?

878
00:49:15,286 --> 00:49:17,153
( laughs )

879
00:49:17,155 --> 00:49:19,572
Shit.

880
00:49:22,493 --> 00:49:24,043
Cops.

881
00:49:24,045 --> 00:49:26,045
Now there's a confused
bunch for ya.

882
00:49:26,047 --> 00:49:27,713
They don't know
what they want,

883
00:49:27,715 --> 00:49:29,749
so they're always
giving you a choice.

884
00:49:29,751 --> 00:49:31,467
Like this last time.
This vice cop,

885
00:49:31,469 --> 00:49:34,470
he says to me,
"Give me head or
you're going to jail."

886
00:49:34,472 --> 00:49:36,005
So I give him head.

887
00:49:36,007 --> 00:49:39,058
And then the fucker busts me
for jaywalking.

888
00:49:39,060 --> 00:49:41,761
I didn't use the crosswalk
on the way to his dick.

889
00:49:41,763 --> 00:49:45,097
Well, excuse me, Officer,
but if your dick had been
long enough,

890
00:49:45,099 --> 00:49:47,600
I wouldn't have had to
cross the fucking street.

891
00:49:49,821 --> 00:49:52,688
I wish the beach boys
had busted me.

892
00:49:52,690 --> 00:49:54,940
I could use
a night in jail.

893
00:49:54,942 --> 00:49:57,076
Just for the rest,
you know?

894
00:49:58,979 --> 00:50:01,414
Hey.
( gasps )

895
00:50:05,086 --> 00:50:07,620
Missed you, baby.

896
00:50:09,007 --> 00:50:11,040
So how much
did we do tonight?

897
00:50:12,260 --> 00:50:14,343
It's-- it's been slow, man.

898
00:50:14,345 --> 00:50:16,962
Oh, yeah?
So what have you done?

899
00:50:16,964 --> 00:50:19,715
Hey, I told you.
It's been slow.

900
00:50:19,717 --> 00:50:21,267
So you've probably done,
what, four 30s.

901
00:50:21,269 --> 00:50:24,136
You might have caught
a 50 or two? What is that?

902
00:50:24,138 --> 00:50:27,056
- Four 30s, we're talking 120.
- Just forget about it.

903
00:50:27,058 --> 00:50:28,941
Wait a minute.
What did I say?

904
00:50:28,943 --> 00:50:31,009
You said four 30s,
but--

905
00:50:31,011 --> 00:50:34,814
Four 30s and two 50s.

906
00:50:34,816 --> 00:50:36,699
Well, it's been slow, right?

907
00:50:36,701 --> 00:50:38,200
Yeah.

908
00:50:38,202 --> 00:50:41,320
So let's say
you only did

909
00:50:41,322 --> 00:50:42,571
one 50.

910
00:50:42,573 --> 00:50:44,874
You might have gotten bored
and did a quick 20.

911
00:50:44,876 --> 00:50:46,542
Hey, wait a minute.

912
00:50:46,544 --> 00:50:49,628
What the fuck am I thinking?
I forgot about yesterday.

913
00:50:49,630 --> 00:50:51,630
( gasps )

914
00:50:51,632 --> 00:50:53,582
You took off yesterday.

915
00:50:53,584 --> 00:50:57,803
So, uh, what have you
been doing since yesterday?

916
00:50:57,805 --> 00:50:59,755
What are you doing
around here?

917
00:50:59,757 --> 00:51:01,373
<i> Welfare work?</i>

918
00:51:01,375 --> 00:51:04,009
You've been with that
bookworm again, hmm?

919
00:51:04,011 --> 00:51:06,262
- That dyke Katie.
- No. No, no. I--

920
00:51:06,264 --> 00:51:09,565
I told you once before,
reading is bad for your eyes.

921
00:51:09,567 --> 00:51:11,550
Hey, man, I swear.
I haven't seen Katie.

922
00:51:11,552 --> 00:51:14,386
I got this trick
and he took me down here
to this motel

923
00:51:14,388 --> 00:51:16,388
- and it was an all-nighter.
- Yeah.

924
00:51:16,390 --> 00:51:18,657
I just slept in.
I couldn't help it, man.

925
00:51:18,659 --> 00:51:21,327
- You should've
made plenty, right?
- He robbed me!

926
00:51:21,329 --> 00:51:24,363
- Bullshit!
- I told you, it's been slow.

927
00:51:24,365 --> 00:51:26,665
- Man:<i> Me spare some change?</i>
- Don't give me that slow shit.

928
00:51:26,667 --> 00:51:28,751
- You stink of booze.
- I'm telling you the truth.

929
00:51:28,753 --> 00:51:31,236
- How 'bout a dollar, then, mon?
- Get the fuck outta here!

930
00:51:31,238 --> 00:51:33,005
Where is it?
Where's the rest of it?!

931
00:51:33,007 --> 00:51:35,841
Here, mon. Take the dollar!
Leave the woman alone!

932
00:51:35,843 --> 00:51:38,344
- Buzz off!
- Hey!

933
00:51:38,346 --> 00:51:40,429
Liz:
<i> Take your foot off of him!</i>
<i> You're hurting him!</i>

934
00:51:40,431 --> 00:51:42,581
- Listen to the woman.
-<i> Leave him alone!</i>

935
00:51:42,583 --> 00:51:44,216
( gasps )

936
00:51:44,218 --> 00:51:46,418
I don't got any more.
I swear on my mother.

937
00:51:46,420 --> 00:51:49,221
Well, your mother's dead.
So you better swear on
somebody else,

938
00:51:49,223 --> 00:51:51,857
but dust don't count
in my book.

939
00:51:51,859 --> 00:51:53,976
I'm gonna be back
in an hour.

940
00:51:53,978 --> 00:51:55,561
You better have done
four by then.

941
00:51:55,563 --> 00:51:57,646
I don't care what
you have to do to catch cock.

942
00:51:57,648 --> 00:51:59,815
Lie in the street
with your fucking legs
in the air.

943
00:51:59,817 --> 00:52:01,567
Just do it.

944
00:52:01,569 --> 00:52:04,537
Was that third finger left hand
or third finger right?

945
00:52:04,539 --> 00:52:05,938
Take your pick!

946
00:52:05,940 --> 00:52:08,124
I got it.

947
00:52:22,473 --> 00:52:25,341
Who the fuck
does she think she is?

948
00:52:26,761 --> 00:52:28,761
You only need one
like that.

949
00:52:28,763 --> 00:52:30,980
One bad apple

950
00:52:30,982 --> 00:52:32,681
and all the others rot.

951
00:52:34,435 --> 00:52:36,418
And if she thinks
that she can dump me

952
00:52:36,420 --> 00:52:38,521
like I was one of her
fucking tricks, well,

953
00:52:38,523 --> 00:52:42,474
she's got
a big surprise coming.

954
00:52:42,476 --> 00:52:44,994
Protection.
He is my protection.

955
00:52:44,996 --> 00:52:47,530
I mean, we can't even
carry a knife anymore.

956
00:52:47,532 --> 00:52:49,331
You get caught,
they bust you

957
00:52:49,333 --> 00:52:51,834
on a concealed
weapons charge.

958
00:52:51,836 --> 00:52:55,120
You work on your back,
you gotta have a middleman.

959
00:52:55,122 --> 00:52:58,507
Or you could end up
on your back in the morgue.

960
00:53:02,013 --> 00:53:03,846
I got somebody that will
fix her up.

961
00:53:05,766 --> 00:53:08,467
And he'll fix her for good.
They'll never recognize her.

962
00:53:10,137 --> 00:53:12,021
Even if they do,
who cares?

963
00:53:12,023 --> 00:53:14,523
She's a whore.

964
00:53:14,525 --> 00:53:17,843
Hey, it was a trick,
wasn't it?

965
00:53:17,845 --> 00:53:21,647
I mean, there are a lot
of freaky tricks around,
you know?

966
00:53:23,367 --> 00:53:25,951
Sometimes tricks,
they--

967
00:53:25,953 --> 00:53:28,737
they freak out.

968
00:53:28,739 --> 00:53:30,489
What can you do?

969
00:53:31,959 --> 00:53:33,409
There's this one,
right,

970
00:53:33,411 --> 00:53:35,628
he was young,
but he was small.

971
00:53:35,630 --> 00:53:39,215
He was vicious and starts
sticking it in me right away.

972
00:53:39,217 --> 00:53:41,800
All of a sudden,
he starts kissing me.

973
00:53:41,802 --> 00:53:44,637
Man, I never kiss nobody.

974
00:53:44,639 --> 00:53:46,305
You never do.

975
00:53:46,307 --> 00:53:48,507
I mean,
I'll suck their cock,
they can lick me,

976
00:53:48,509 --> 00:53:50,759
they can fuck me,
but no kissing.

977
00:53:50,761 --> 00:53:52,394
And no fingers neither.

978
00:53:52,396 --> 00:53:53,762
I mean, you should
see their nails.

979
00:53:53,764 --> 00:53:55,981
I mean, who knows where
their fingers have been?

980
00:53:55,983 --> 00:53:57,733
No sucking
my breasts neither.

981
00:53:57,735 --> 00:54:01,219
So anyway, this guy,
he starts trying to kiss me.

982
00:54:01,221 --> 00:54:03,856
So I said to him,
"Hey, man, I don't kiss."

983
00:54:03,858 --> 00:54:05,324
He didn't seem to mind.

984
00:54:05,326 --> 00:54:06,892
All of a sudden
he says to me,

985
00:54:06,894 --> 00:54:08,527
( lowered )
"Is it nice?"

986
00:54:08,529 --> 00:54:10,896
I said to him,
"Is what nice?"

987
00:54:10,898 --> 00:54:12,414
( lowered )
He says, "This,"

988
00:54:12,416 --> 00:54:14,917
and pushes it in
even harder.

989
00:54:14,919 --> 00:54:17,903
<i> Now I know he wanted me</i>
<i> to talk dirty, right?</i>

990
00:54:17,905 --> 00:54:20,756
<i> I was still</i>
<i> pretty new to the game.</i>
<i> I didn't understand.</i>

991
00:54:20,758 --> 00:54:23,125
<i> So I said,</i>
<i> "It's all right, I guess."</i>

992
00:54:23,127 --> 00:54:25,878
<i> ( lowered )</i>
<i> "All right? All right?"</i>
<i> he says. "Is that all?"</i>

993
00:54:25,880 --> 00:54:28,464
<i> And then he pulls out.</i>
<i> So I asked him why</i>
<i> he pulled out.</i>

994
00:54:28,466 --> 00:54:31,100
<i> And he says,</i>
<i> ( lowered ) "Because</i>
<i> you're not enjoying it."</i>

995
00:54:31,102 --> 00:54:32,935
<i> I said, "Hey,</i>
<i> I don't have to enjoy it.</i>

996
00:54:32,937 --> 00:54:34,586
<i> You paid for it.</i>
<i> You enjoy it."</i>

997
00:54:34,588 --> 00:54:36,689
<i> And he goes, ( lowered )</i>
<i> "But I can't enjoy it</i>

998
00:54:36,691 --> 00:54:38,807
<i> if I know</i>
<i> you're only doing it</i>
<i> because I paid you."</i>

999
00:54:38,809 --> 00:54:41,093
<i> Well, if you want passion,</i>
<i> that costs extra.</i>

1000
00:54:41,095 --> 00:54:44,530
<i> By then his time was up,</i>
<i> so I asked him if he</i>
<i> was finished.</i>

1001
00:54:44,532 --> 00:54:46,282
<i> ( lowered )</i>
<i> "Finished?" he says.</i>

1002
00:54:46,284 --> 00:54:47,950
<i> "I haven't even started yet.</i>
<i> Kiss me."</i>

1003
00:54:47,952 --> 00:54:50,268
<i> So he yanks my head and he</i>
<i> starts trying to kiss me.</i>

1004
00:54:50,270 --> 00:54:52,821
<i> And I'm trying to</i>
<i> push him away and then</i>
<i> he starts shouting to me,</i>

1005
00:54:52,823 --> 00:54:54,823
<i> ( lowered )</i>
<i> "You fucking cunts!</i>
<i> You're all the same!</i>

1006
00:54:54,825 --> 00:54:56,825
<i> You're dead, all of ya!</i>
<i> No feelings!"</i>

1007
00:54:56,827 --> 00:54:59,378
<i> And then he starts</i>
<i> trying to kiss me again.</i>

1008
00:54:59,380 --> 00:55:01,130
<i> Then he asks</i>
<i> for his money back.</i>

1009
00:55:01,132 --> 00:55:03,999
<i> I said, "Sorry.</i>
<i> No deposit, no return."</i>

1010
00:55:04,001 --> 00:55:06,001
<i> Then I tried to get up</i>
<i> and get out.</i>

1011
00:55:06,003 --> 00:55:08,620
<i> Suddenly, he grabs my bag</i>
<i> with one and my hair</i>
<i> with the other</i>

1012
00:55:08,622 --> 00:55:10,472
<i> and he starts banging my head</i>
<i> against the floor.</i>

1013
00:55:10,474 --> 00:55:12,958
<i> I mean, I thought my fucking</i>
<i> brain was gonna explode.</i>

1014
00:55:12,960 --> 00:55:15,344
<i> I'm telling you,</i>
<i> he must have slammed</i>
<i> my head about six times</i>

1015
00:55:15,346 --> 00:55:17,763
<i> before that damn door</i>
<i> finally opened.</i>

1016
00:55:23,604 --> 00:55:26,021
You oughta be more careful
with who you date.

1017
00:55:26,023 --> 00:55:28,324
That's when I realized,

1018
00:55:28,326 --> 00:55:30,442
you can't work
without a pimp.

1019
00:55:30,444 --> 00:55:33,145
So I became
one of Blake's girls.

1020
00:55:33,147 --> 00:55:35,147
Well,
it seems to me

1021
00:55:35,149 --> 00:55:38,150
like this pimp
set you up, mon.

1022
00:55:38,152 --> 00:55:40,586
Yeah. I thought
of that, too.

1023
00:55:40,588 --> 00:55:43,038
And one day I put it
to him point-blank.

1024
00:55:43,040 --> 00:55:45,791
And point-blank
he denied it.

1025
00:55:45,793 --> 00:55:48,961
Practically knocked
my goddamn teeth
down my throat.

1026
00:55:48,963 --> 00:55:51,046
Me and my girls.

1027
00:55:51,048 --> 00:55:52,881
I look after 'em.

1028
00:55:52,883 --> 00:55:56,001
I'm out all hours
keeping an eye out on 'em

1029
00:55:56,003 --> 00:55:58,137
just to make sure
they're safe.

1030
00:55:58,139 --> 00:56:01,023
I drive around
just checking.

1031
00:56:03,010 --> 00:56:06,478
I know all the places
that they go with their dates.

1032
00:56:08,899 --> 00:56:11,316
Sometimes I follow 'em.

1033
00:56:11,318 --> 00:56:14,903
You see, we're like
business partners.

1034
00:56:14,905 --> 00:56:16,855
They fuck

1035
00:56:16,857 --> 00:56:19,274
and I manage.

1036
00:56:19,276 --> 00:56:21,226
Tell me something.

1037
00:56:21,228 --> 00:56:23,212
How much does
he make off you?

1038
00:56:23,214 --> 00:56:25,530
What's his
profit margin?

1039
00:56:25,532 --> 00:56:28,133
What's that got
to do with it?

1040
00:56:28,135 --> 00:56:30,002
Have some herb.

1041
00:56:35,559 --> 00:56:37,559
If I'm not paying
for their rent,

1042
00:56:37,561 --> 00:56:41,046
I'm paying for
their goddamn fines.

1043
00:56:41,048 --> 00:56:43,381
( sniffs )
I pay for their clothes,

1044
00:56:43,383 --> 00:56:45,550
their checkups.

1045
00:56:45,552 --> 00:56:48,103
I pay for their rubbers.

1046
00:56:48,105 --> 00:56:49,521
( sniffs )

1047
00:56:49,523 --> 00:56:52,491
Even at wholesale,
they're still expensive.

1048
00:56:53,778 --> 00:56:56,495
Or as I tell you,

1049
00:56:56,497 --> 00:56:58,396
they don't come cheap.

1050
00:56:58,398 --> 00:56:59,665
( sniffs )

1051
00:57:02,620 --> 00:57:04,953
So how much
you say he takes?

1052
00:57:04,955 --> 00:57:06,738
100%.

1053
00:57:06,740 --> 00:57:09,007
Mon, it's like
you're getting
screwed twice.

1054
00:57:10,544 --> 00:57:11,510
Hmm.

1055
00:57:13,747 --> 00:57:16,932
Look, it's just like
I was managing a factory.

1056
00:57:16,934 --> 00:57:19,918
This, it just happens
to be a pussy factory.

1057
00:57:19,920 --> 00:57:22,888
This is exactly why
I'm trying to get
away from him.

1058
00:57:22,890 --> 00:57:26,108
Even factories treat
their employees better.

1059
00:57:26,110 --> 00:57:27,860
At least
they get benefits.

1060
00:57:27,862 --> 00:57:30,062
Mm.

1061
00:57:30,064 --> 00:57:32,181
But it's still a factory

1062
00:57:32,183 --> 00:57:34,783
with employees

1063
00:57:34,785 --> 00:57:37,519
and somebody like me
running things.

1064
00:57:38,989 --> 00:57:41,290
I got what they call

1065
00:57:41,292 --> 00:57:43,859
"entrepreneurial flair."

1066
00:57:44,995 --> 00:57:46,995
I can see a need

1067
00:57:46,997 --> 00:57:48,997
and I fill a demand.

1068
00:57:48,999 --> 00:57:52,000
The man is a slave driver.

1069
00:57:53,637 --> 00:57:56,255
Holy shit.
Just look at that one.

1070
00:57:56,257 --> 00:57:57,756
Dumb kid.

1071
00:58:03,430 --> 00:58:04,930
<i> ( horn honks )</i>

1072
00:58:08,986 --> 00:58:10,569
<i> ( horn honks )</i>

1073
00:58:12,823 --> 00:58:14,639
She supposed to be
selling sex.

1074
00:58:14,641 --> 00:58:16,658
It looks like she's waiting
for the goddamn bus.

1075
00:58:16,660 --> 00:58:19,411
Okay, so it's hot,
your shoes hurt,

1076
00:58:19,413 --> 00:58:21,330
and she had an abortion
last week.

1077
00:58:21,332 --> 00:58:23,499
Guess who picked up
the tab on that one.

1078
00:58:23,501 --> 00:58:25,033
Everybody starts off

1079
00:58:25,035 --> 00:58:27,336
by thinking they're gonna
make a lot of money

1080
00:58:27,338 --> 00:58:29,371
and get out of it
in a couple of years.

1081
00:58:29,373 --> 00:58:31,623
But it never happens.

1082
00:58:31,625 --> 00:58:33,658
You just stay doing it.

1083
00:58:33,660 --> 00:58:35,844
I've seen some pretty kids

1084
00:58:35,846 --> 00:58:39,047
with faces like dogs
after only six months.

1085
00:58:39,049 --> 00:58:40,849
You know,

1086
00:58:40,851 --> 00:58:44,669
they say you can tell a woman
that's been doing this.

1087
00:58:44,671 --> 00:58:47,022
That it shows in her face.

1088
00:58:49,676 --> 00:58:52,427
I mean, look at mine.

1089
00:58:52,429 --> 00:58:54,062
Does it show?

1090
00:58:55,900 --> 00:58:58,734
In my eyes?
That's where it starts,
they say.

1091
00:58:58,736 --> 00:59:01,703
In the eyes and then
in the mouth. All hard.

1092
00:59:03,490 --> 00:59:05,407
They're wrong.

1093
00:59:05,409 --> 00:59:07,659
Yeah.
They're full of shit.

1094
00:59:07,661 --> 00:59:09,127
You better believe
they're full of shit.

1095
00:59:09,129 --> 00:59:11,196
Yeah. They're full of shit.
You know why?

1096
00:59:11,198 --> 00:59:12,965
Because it
starts in here.

1097
00:59:12,967 --> 00:59:14,800
It's like a cancer

1098
00:59:14,802 --> 00:59:18,303
and then it just starts
eating away at you until
there's nothing left.

1099
00:59:18,305 --> 00:59:20,923
Just an empty shell.

1100
00:59:20,925 --> 00:59:23,875
They're oversexed
and they're born like that.

1101
00:59:23,877 --> 00:59:27,846
Nature's rejects
from the moment that they
came into this world.

1102
00:59:27,848 --> 00:59:30,015
All they have to offer
is their bodies,

1103
00:59:30,017 --> 00:59:32,384
so they might as well
get paid for it.

1104
00:59:32,386 --> 00:59:35,020
They're born
with a price tag.

1105
00:59:37,324 --> 00:59:38,740
If somebody gave 'em
a million bucks,

1106
00:59:38,742 --> 00:59:40,275
they'd be back on
the streets in a week.

1107
00:59:40,277 --> 00:59:41,910
They can't
help themselves.

1108
00:59:41,912 --> 00:59:44,529
There's nothing
you can do about it.

1109
00:59:46,400 --> 00:59:48,500
It's like being born
black or white.

1110
00:59:48,502 --> 00:59:51,536
It's just the way they are.

1111
00:59:51,538 --> 00:59:53,789
I must be some use
to somebody.

1112
00:59:53,791 --> 00:59:57,559
I mean, there must be
a reason for me.

1113
00:59:59,196 --> 01:00:00,629
Right?

1114
01:00:00,631 --> 01:00:02,931
You know, years ago,
when I first got started,

1115
01:00:02,933 --> 01:00:05,867
before I got things
straightened out around here,

1116
01:00:05,869 --> 01:00:08,337
I was always
getting busted

1117
01:00:08,339 --> 01:00:10,806
for pandering,
pimping.

1118
01:00:10,808 --> 01:00:12,908
Do you think
what I do is wrong?

1119
01:00:12,910 --> 01:00:16,712
I think what
a pimp does
is wrong.

1120
01:00:18,282 --> 01:00:21,249
I think it's the law
that's wrong.

1121
01:00:21,251 --> 01:00:23,318
Katie called him
a parasite.

1122
01:00:23,320 --> 01:00:26,321
Parasite.

1123
01:00:26,323 --> 01:00:28,490
Parasite.

1124
01:00:28,492 --> 01:00:31,076
I like that word.

1125
01:00:31,078 --> 01:00:32,944
Parasite.

1126
01:00:32,946 --> 01:00:35,964
Look, if it was illegal
to live off the earnings
of others,

1127
01:00:35,966 --> 01:00:38,500
then the stock exchange
would be shut down tomorrow.

1128
01:00:38,502 --> 01:00:42,087
And all the employment agencies
would be charged with pimping.

1129
01:00:42,089 --> 01:00:45,140
I'm like an employment
agency myself,

1130
01:00:45,142 --> 01:00:46,758
only I'm not legal.

1131
01:00:46,760 --> 01:00:48,626
And I don't want
to be illegal.

1132
01:00:48,628 --> 01:00:51,596
You know,
you should be legal.

1133
01:00:52,816 --> 01:00:54,916
Then there wouldn't be
a need for him.

1134
01:00:57,104 --> 01:01:00,555
You make it legal
and I'll open an office.

1135
01:01:00,557 --> 01:01:02,591
Until then,

1136
01:01:02,593 --> 01:01:04,793
this is my office.

1137
01:01:04,795 --> 01:01:07,829
Some of our regulars,
they phone me.

1138
01:01:07,831 --> 01:01:09,998
And they tell me what
they want and I deliver.

1139
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:13,702
Maybe I'm nothing more
than takeout food.

1140
01:01:13,704 --> 01:01:15,837
Easy, quick,
and affordable.

1141
01:01:15,839 --> 01:01:19,241
I'm sort of
a dial-a-ride service.

1142
01:01:19,243 --> 01:01:21,643
And I'm real charitable, too.

1143
01:01:21,645 --> 01:01:24,413
I always make sure
I give a little back.

1144
01:01:24,415 --> 01:01:26,948
I even make
regular donations

1145
01:01:26,950 --> 01:01:29,384
to the policemen's
pension fund.

1146
01:01:29,386 --> 01:01:31,787
( laughs )

1147
01:01:42,950 --> 01:01:45,367
Do you think
for some men,

1148
01:01:45,369 --> 01:01:47,953
even a few,

1149
01:01:47,955 --> 01:01:50,739
that I'm a cure
for loneliness?

1150
01:01:59,166 --> 01:02:01,750
Maybe a short-term cure.

1151
01:02:13,347 --> 01:02:15,380
<i> The more I think about it,</i>

1152
01:02:15,382 --> 01:02:19,017
<i> the more I'd really like</i>
<i> to change my life.</i>

1153
01:02:19,019 --> 01:02:22,020
<i> If only I could find</i>
<i> a decent man.</i>

1154
01:02:22,022 --> 01:02:24,356
<i> Or even a man</i>
<i> that just wanted a...</i>

1155
01:02:26,243 --> 01:02:28,360
what you call it?
You know, they got a wife

1156
01:02:28,362 --> 01:02:31,729
and then they got a...
a mistress. Yeah, that's it.

1157
01:02:31,731 --> 01:02:33,832
I'd really love that.

1158
01:02:35,085 --> 01:02:37,369
Where in the hell
am I gonna find that?

1159
01:02:37,371 --> 01:02:39,404
<i> ( horn honks )</i>

1160
01:02:39,406 --> 01:02:40,872
Hey, you wanna move in?

1161
01:02:42,009 --> 01:02:43,842
Can you afford
the down payment?

1162
01:02:43,844 --> 01:02:45,710
<i> Who knows? Come here.</i>

1163
01:02:49,299 --> 01:02:51,082
What sign are you?

1164
01:02:51,084 --> 01:02:53,101
- What sign am I?
- Quickly.

1165
01:02:53,103 --> 01:02:56,188
I'm a stop sign.

1166
01:02:56,190 --> 01:02:58,256
Ow! You're a Scorpio.

1167
01:02:58,258 --> 01:03:00,108
- You're a Scorpio, aren't you?
- Yeah, I'm a Scorpio.

1168
01:03:00,110 --> 01:03:02,060
- Hey, how'd you know?
- Shit. I need a Virgo.

1169
01:03:02,062 --> 01:03:03,979
Do you know where
I can find one?

1170
01:03:03,981 --> 01:03:06,481
- I'll be a Virgo for 40.
- No, no. I need a real one.

1171
01:03:06,483 --> 01:03:08,283
And my cards say
I can only pay 10.

1172
01:03:08,285 --> 01:03:11,987
- ( sighs )
-<i> You have the most</i>
<i>  beautiful eyes.</i>

1173
01:03:11,989 --> 01:03:14,456
I'll catch you
in another lifetime.

1174
01:03:14,458 --> 01:03:15,907
Bye.

1175
01:03:17,444 --> 01:03:19,211
What a weirdo.

1176
01:03:20,581 --> 01:03:22,497
I wonder what he was into.

1177
01:03:22,499 --> 01:03:25,550
Eh, I don't mind

1178
01:03:25,552 --> 01:03:27,719
something different
once in a while,

1179
01:03:27,721 --> 01:03:31,506
but I don't do
nothing dirty.

1180
01:03:31,508 --> 01:03:33,791
You know?
I mean,

1181
01:03:33,793 --> 01:03:36,011
I don't take
golden showers

1182
01:03:36,013 --> 01:03:39,681
and I don't give
golden showers.

1183
01:03:39,683 --> 01:03:42,350
But...

1184
01:03:42,352 --> 01:03:44,486
well,

1185
01:03:44,488 --> 01:03:46,071
there was this one guy,
right,

1186
01:03:46,073 --> 01:03:48,607
he used to like watching me
take a dump, okay?

1187
01:03:48,609 --> 01:03:50,826
I mean, he used
a flashlight.

1188
01:03:50,828 --> 01:03:52,911
Trouble is,
he always seemed to show up

1189
01:03:52,913 --> 01:03:54,696
after I'd already had one.

1190
01:03:54,698 --> 01:03:56,915
I haven't seen him around
in a while.

1191
01:03:56,917 --> 01:03:59,835
Guess he found someone
more regular.

1192
01:04:01,154 --> 01:04:04,506
Yeah, but I got
this other trick,

1193
01:04:04,508 --> 01:04:05,874
he's an older guy,
you know.

1194
01:04:05,876 --> 01:04:07,492
Real soft-spoken.

1195
01:04:07,494 --> 01:04:11,379
I swear, he could be
a judge or doctor or something.

1196
01:04:11,381 --> 01:04:14,850
And we have a regular date
every Thursday at 3:00.

1197
01:04:14,852 --> 01:04:17,969
And he always pays me
with brand-new money.

1198
01:04:19,723 --> 01:04:22,307
<i> Get the money first.</i>
<i> That's my motto.</i>

1199
01:04:22,309 --> 01:04:24,559
<i> But before I could get</i>
<i> my pants down,</i>

1200
01:04:24,561 --> 01:04:25,894
<i> he's shaking his head.</i>

1201
01:04:25,896 --> 01:04:27,779
<i> So I offer him</i>
<i> a tit job.</i>

1202
01:04:27,781 --> 01:04:29,447
<i> Strike two.</i>

1203
01:04:29,449 --> 01:04:31,849
<i> When I realized he didn't</i>
<i> want straight sex,</i>

1204
01:04:31,851 --> 01:04:33,535
<i> I thought,</i>
<i> "Hello, another nut."</i>

1205
01:04:33,537 --> 01:04:36,020
<i> And I let him know</i>
<i> I didn't do nothing dirty.</i>

1206
01:04:36,022 --> 01:04:37,689
I don't do anything dirty.

1207
01:04:37,691 --> 01:04:40,158
<i> Then he just nods</i>
<i> and points to my shoe.</i>

1208
01:04:47,084 --> 01:04:49,668
<i> For a minute, I thought</i>
<i> he was gonna fuck me with it.</i>

1209
01:04:49,670 --> 01:04:51,336
<i> I mean,</i>
<i> you wouldn't believe</i>

1210
01:04:51,338 --> 01:04:53,388
<i> some of the things</i>
<i> they've tried to stick up me.</i>

1211
01:04:53,390 --> 01:04:55,257
<i> Then he gives me</i>
<i> this piece of paper</i>

1212
01:04:55,259 --> 01:04:57,425
<i> and tells me not to read it</i>
<i> until he says so.</i>

1213
01:04:57,427 --> 01:05:00,011
<i> Finally, he gets</i>
<i> his dick out, right?</i>

1214
01:05:00,013 --> 01:05:02,347
What do you
want me to do?

1215
01:05:02,349 --> 01:05:04,015
Read me the note.

1216
01:05:04,017 --> 01:05:06,067
<i> About now, he's starting</i>
<i> to get a hard on.</i>

1217
01:05:06,069 --> 01:05:08,353
Liz:
<i> "You naughty boy, Johnny.</i>

1218
01:05:08,355 --> 01:05:11,406
You dirty little boy.
Mommy's very, very
angry with you"?

1219
01:05:11,408 --> 01:05:13,191
( groaning )
Louder.

1220
01:05:13,193 --> 01:05:15,327
Liz:
<i> And before you know it,</i>
<i> he's beating his meat</i>

1221
01:05:15,329 --> 01:05:17,245
<i> and licking my shoe.</i>

1222
01:05:18,782 --> 01:05:21,366
"You naughty boy, Johnny.

1223
01:05:21,368 --> 01:05:23,702
You dirty little boy.

1224
01:05:23,704 --> 01:05:27,455
<i> Mommy's very,</i>
<i> very angry with you.</i>

1225
01:05:27,457 --> 01:05:29,341
You naughty boy, Johnny!

1226
01:05:29,343 --> 01:05:31,676
You dirty little boy!

1227
01:05:31,678 --> 01:05:35,079
Mommy's very,
very angry with you!

1228
01:05:35,081 --> 01:05:38,082
<i> You naughty boy, Johnny!</i>

1229
01:05:38,084 --> 01:05:40,251
<i> You dirty little boy!</i>

1230
01:05:40,253 --> 01:05:44,139
Mommy's very, very, very,
very angry with you"!

1231
01:05:44,141 --> 01:05:46,274
<i> ( groaning continues )</i>
<i> Keep it up.</i>

1232
01:05:46,276 --> 01:05:49,611
( yawns )
"You naughty boy, Johnny.

1233
01:05:49,613 --> 01:05:51,696
You dirty little boy,
Johnny.

1234
01:05:51,698 --> 01:05:54,482
Mommy's very,
very angry with you."

1235
01:05:54,484 --> 01:05:56,401
( laughing )

1236
01:05:58,455 --> 01:06:01,206
Liz:
<i> Different strokes</i>
<i> for different folks.</i>

1237
01:06:01,208 --> 01:06:04,075
<i> Who can figure it?</i>
<i> But that's how Johnny came.</i>

1238
01:06:10,968 --> 01:06:13,585
Yeah, I know my lines now,

1239
01:06:13,587 --> 01:06:15,804
but he's always quick.

1240
01:06:15,806 --> 01:06:17,339
That's what you want, quick.

1241
01:06:17,341 --> 01:06:19,891
I mean, some of 'em
take forever.

1242
01:06:19,893 --> 01:06:22,794
The nervous ones,
they can be a real bitch.

1243
01:06:22,796 --> 01:06:25,296
Sometimes they never get
a hard-on at all.

1244
01:06:25,298 --> 01:06:27,799
They're too embarrassed
to ask for their money back.

1245
01:06:27,801 --> 01:06:30,435
Hey, they wouldn't
get it back anyway.

1246
01:06:30,437 --> 01:06:32,804
I mean, if you go
to a restaurant and you
order a meal

1247
01:06:32,806 --> 01:06:35,907
and you suddenly
lose your appetite,
it's not my fault, is it?

1248
01:06:35,909 --> 01:06:39,160
The best guys are the ones
in the lunch hour.

1249
01:06:39,162 --> 01:06:40,945
They're always in a rush.

1250
01:06:40,947 --> 01:06:43,081
Or the older guys.
They're good, too.

1251
01:06:43,083 --> 01:06:45,116
I mean, sometimes
I'm putting the rubber on

1252
01:06:45,118 --> 01:06:47,285
and then all of a sudden, oops.
It's all over.

1253
01:06:47,287 --> 01:06:49,421
"Oh, honey. I needed that,"
I'd say to them

1254
01:06:49,423 --> 01:06:51,172
and finish them off
with my hand

1255
01:06:51,174 --> 01:06:54,426
and pretend to be
real disappointed and stuff.

1256
01:06:54,428 --> 01:06:57,212
You know, so they
don't feel cheated.

1257
01:06:59,716 --> 01:07:01,516
( sighs )

1258
01:07:02,836 --> 01:07:04,769
But you know
who the worst ones are?

1259
01:07:04,771 --> 01:07:06,504
The young ones.

1260
01:07:06,506 --> 01:07:09,808
I mean, they're always
laying these head trips on you.

1261
01:07:09,810 --> 01:07:12,861
Like, ( whiny )
"Usually I don't have
to pay for it."

1262
01:07:12,863 --> 01:07:15,196
I mean,
I don't want to hear that.

1263
01:07:15,198 --> 01:07:17,399
I don't got time
for that shit.

1264
01:07:17,401 --> 01:07:19,651
And then they start
holding out on you

1265
01:07:19,653 --> 01:07:22,037
like they're doing you
some big favor or something.

1266
01:07:22,039 --> 01:07:24,155
Thanks,
but no, thanks.

1267
01:07:24,157 --> 01:07:26,991
I mean, for them,
I need a meter like a taxi.

1268
01:07:28,361 --> 01:07:30,862
No, I like the ones
that just want to hurry up,

1269
01:07:30,864 --> 01:07:33,548
- get it over with,
and go home.
-<i> ( clapping )</i>

1270
01:07:38,872 --> 01:07:41,139
Yeah, I'm going home.

1271
01:07:51,852 --> 01:07:53,985
( playing harmonica )

1272
01:08:09,503 --> 01:08:11,169
That's Chris.

1273
01:08:11,171 --> 01:08:13,838
Handsome, isn't he?

1274
01:08:13,840 --> 01:08:15,790
He's so smart.

1275
01:08:15,792 --> 01:08:18,293
He's six now.

1276
01:08:19,763 --> 01:08:22,180
Yeah, he's at
that age where--

1277
01:08:22,182 --> 01:08:25,082
well, you know,
he's grown up and...

1278
01:08:25,084 --> 01:08:27,719
well, if he
was living with me,

1279
01:08:27,721 --> 01:08:29,637
how would I explain it?

1280
01:08:29,639 --> 01:08:32,023
I mean,
I work at night,

1281
01:08:32,025 --> 01:08:35,310
so you could say
I got a night job.

1282
01:08:35,312 --> 01:08:38,763
But then when I go to jail
and I don't come home
during the day,

1283
01:08:38,765 --> 01:08:40,765
I mean,
how do I explain that?

1284
01:08:40,767 --> 01:08:43,318
Everybody says he's smart.

1285
01:08:43,320 --> 01:08:46,154
You should hear him read.

1286
01:08:46,156 --> 01:08:49,624
He knows all the animals.

1287
01:08:50,944 --> 01:08:53,128
I taught him that.

1288
01:08:53,130 --> 01:08:55,413
He loves animals.

1289
01:08:56,917 --> 01:09:00,502
He sent me this painting
of his cat.

1290
01:09:00,504 --> 01:09:03,838
"This is Mandy,"
he wrote on the back.

1291
01:09:03,840 --> 01:09:06,424
"She sleeps in
the washing machine."

1292
01:09:09,763 --> 01:09:12,313
He's with a nice couple.

1293
01:09:12,315 --> 01:09:14,816
They don't have
any kids of their own.

1294
01:09:17,136 --> 01:09:19,654
He was sort of adopted.

1295
01:09:19,656 --> 01:09:21,773
After my mom died...

1296
01:09:24,310 --> 01:09:28,413
the courts said
I was an unfit mother.

1297
01:09:30,951 --> 01:09:33,284
Yeah, that's when
I moved on.

1298
01:09:37,174 --> 01:09:39,424
Chris seems
happy enough, though.

1299
01:09:42,179 --> 01:09:44,996
I wish he was with me,

1300
01:09:44,998 --> 01:09:48,132
but I can see him
whenever I want to.

1301
01:09:49,886 --> 01:09:51,853
But I have to call first,
but...

1302
01:09:55,108 --> 01:09:58,776
uh, I don't go back there
too much.

1303
01:10:01,948 --> 01:10:04,315
It kinda upsets me.

1304
01:10:06,352 --> 01:10:09,237
<i> Last time I went back there,</i>
<i> I didn't tell him I was coming.</i>

1305
01:10:09,239 --> 01:10:11,289
<i> I stood outside his school</i>

1306
01:10:11,291 --> 01:10:14,525
<i> and waited for</i>
<i> the class to end.</i>

1307
01:10:14,527 --> 01:10:17,629
<i> He was wearing the jeans</i>
<i> I'd sent him for his birthday.</i>

1308
01:10:17,631 --> 01:10:20,798
<i> They're probably still</i>
<i> a little too big for him,</i>

1309
01:10:20,800 --> 01:10:23,868
<i> but he'll grow into them.</i>

1310
01:10:23,870 --> 01:10:25,637
<i> His foster mother Rachel,</i>

1311
01:10:25,639 --> 01:10:29,206
<i> she was there waiting</i>
<i> to take him home.</i>

1312
01:10:29,208 --> 01:10:31,709
<i> I could hardly stand</i>
<i> to see him go,</i>

1313
01:10:31,711 --> 01:10:35,379
<i> but I don't think</i>

1314
01:10:35,381 --> 01:10:37,315
<i> I'll go back there again,</i>
<i> you know.</i>

1315
01:10:37,317 --> 01:10:39,734
<i> No, not for a while anyway.</i>

1316
01:10:39,736 --> 01:10:42,820
<i> I don't want Chris</i>
<i> growing up hating me.</i>

1317
01:10:42,822 --> 01:10:46,357
<i> I don't want him to be</i>
<i> ashamed of his mother.</i>

1318
01:10:49,946 --> 01:10:51,663
I know he calls Rachel mom,

1319
01:10:51,665 --> 01:10:55,283
but he knows who
his real mother is.

1320
01:11:04,177 --> 01:11:06,794
What I wouldn't give
for a nice, cool shower.

1321
01:11:09,132 --> 01:11:12,083
No, Chris is better off
where he is.

1322
01:11:12,085 --> 01:11:13,885
For now, I know that.

1323
01:11:18,975 --> 01:11:21,109
He looks just like
his father.

1324
01:11:21,111 --> 01:11:23,611
We're still married.

1325
01:11:23,613 --> 01:11:27,365
Chances are we'd still
be together if he hadn't
cheated on me.

1326
01:11:27,367 --> 01:11:30,234
I never cheated on him.

1327
01:11:30,236 --> 01:11:33,705
Hey, what I do isn't exactly
making love, is it?

1328
01:11:33,707 --> 01:11:36,541
Hate would be closer
to the truth.

1329
01:11:37,877 --> 01:11:39,577
I mean,
it isn't even sex

1330
01:11:39,579 --> 01:11:41,779
because sex
has some feelings.

1331
01:11:41,781 --> 01:11:45,300
I mean, if you like somebody,
that's sex.

1332
01:11:45,302 --> 01:11:48,336
Well, I don't like
any of these shits.

1333
01:11:49,673 --> 01:11:52,557
No, there must be
a better word for what I do.

1334
01:11:52,559 --> 01:11:54,926
But I don't know
what it is.

1335
01:11:56,796 --> 01:11:58,596
It's mechanical.

1336
01:11:58,598 --> 01:12:00,682
No feelings.

1337
01:12:02,135 --> 01:12:03,735
No.

1338
01:12:05,488 --> 01:12:08,106
I mean, maybe if you really
psyched yourself up for it,

1339
01:12:08,108 --> 01:12:10,074
you could feel something.

1340
01:12:10,076 --> 01:12:12,577
Who wants to
go through all that?

1341
01:12:12,579 --> 01:12:14,412
I mean,
when I was younger,

1342
01:12:14,414 --> 01:12:17,031
I used to make believe

1343
01:12:17,033 --> 01:12:18,950
somebody out here
was loving me.

1344
01:12:20,920 --> 01:12:24,321
But then I got to the point
where I just hated tricks.

1345
01:12:24,323 --> 01:12:26,290
I hate 'em.

1346
01:12:26,292 --> 01:12:28,343
And they don't
like us, neither.

1347
01:12:28,345 --> 01:12:30,678
I mean, really like us.

1348
01:12:30,680 --> 01:12:33,548
Oh, they want us, all right.
I didn't say that.

1349
01:12:33,550 --> 01:12:36,551
But like us?
No. No way.

1350
01:12:40,140 --> 01:12:42,140
And you never know
who you're with.

1351
01:12:42,142 --> 01:12:45,109
A total stranger
or your own father.

1352
01:12:45,111 --> 01:12:46,444
You just don't know.

1353
01:12:46,446 --> 01:12:48,646
I mean, they're like
Jekyll and Hyde.

1354
01:12:48,648 --> 01:12:51,532
You gotta watch 'em 'cause
they're always up to something.

what do you think
my chances are?

I'd say your chances
are 50/50.
