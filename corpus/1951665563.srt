1
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:48,556
I leave you alone for an hour,
and you destroy my house?

2
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:52,238
And, you, you're no better.

3
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:56,954
You're both evicted!

4
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:02,240
Yes, this could all be yours.

5
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:04,596
This mansion with
all the amenities.

6
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:08,469
Located in the bucolic,
exclusive surroundings...

7
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:11,029
... of Pine Valley Ranch Hills Estates.

8
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:14,637
This mansion overlooks
the tranquil landscape...

9
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:19,999
... of the Pine Valley Ranch Hills Estates
golf course and the cemetery.

10
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:23,029
This is the key
that can open the door...

11
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:26,556
... to your future as a person
who lives in a really big house!

12
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:29,280
And it could all be yours
if you are the winner...

13
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:31,192
... of The Fabulous Super Race.

14
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:35,473
J. W. Globwobbler's latest
television extravaganza.

15
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,594
To enter this contest,
participants must supply...

16
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:41,558
... their own all-terrain vehicles,
and come on down...

17
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:44,951
... to Globwobbler Studios
in beautiful Hollywood, U. S.A.!

18
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:48,829
Only one spot remains. Enter today!

19
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:22,835
It could belong to you! Enter today!

20
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:54,317
Now look, Clown-O,
your ratings are plummeting.

21
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:56,710
I have an idea
how to juice your show up...

22
00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:00,839
...and pull your polka-dotted keister
out of the fire. You need a partner.

23
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,718
A partner?

24
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,070
Yep. An animal partner.

25
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:11,110
What? Like a dog? A monkey?
A parrot maybe?

26
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:14,397
Irving, wheel in Mr. Frisky.

27
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:20,672
Hey, I thought you kids' show hosts
liked animals.

28
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:25,709
We do, sir, but this animal looks
a little dangerous.

29
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:29,429
Clown-O, animals can sense
negative vibrations...

30
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:33,070
...so get off that chair
and say hello to Mr. Frisky.

31
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:37,279
I want you and Mr. Frisky to begin
working up an act right away.

32
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:39,357
Good dog.

33
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,468
Stop! Get him off of me! No! No!

34
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:44,551
Hey, get him off of me!

35
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:46,912
-Mommy!
-I'm a genius!

36
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:52,473
That bear's got talent, moxie, pizzazz!
What's next?

37
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:55,553
Well, sir, if you'll remember,
we're still looking...

38
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:59,235
...for one more contestant to round out
The Fabulous Super Race.

39
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:03,837
I need something crazy and wild,
something totally unexpected.

40
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:14,838
Halt!

41
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,479
Action!

42
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:48,032
And this is our stunt area.

43
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:51,397
These are all trained professionals.
Don't try this at home.

44
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:04,438
-Take my hand, Clarice!
-I love you, Frank!

45
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:28,634
What's this?

46
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:31,712
From the looks of things,
they're here to audition...

47
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:34,917
...for the remaining slot
in The Fabulous Super Race.

48
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:38,432
Is this some kind of a joke?
A pussycat and a mouse?

49
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:42,036
This is about stunts
and people putting their lives at risk...

50
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:45,272
...for a big fat prize.
It's not a nature documentary.

51
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:48,432
-Call security and have these two--
-Sir! Sir, it's...

52
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:50,998
...him.

53
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:05,997
-This gives me the creeps.
-He's the president of Hollywood.

54
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:08,628
He's supposed to give you
the creeps.

55
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:21,433
Greetings, Your Tinselyness.
Imperious leader of Hollywood.

56
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,513
Smile, lrving.

57
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:29,955
I'm terrified, sir.

58
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:31,713
Now you look, J.W.

59
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:36,078
The girls and I overheard what you were
saying about this cat and mouse.

60
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:37,912
Yes.

61
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:41,675
They want to enter the race.
I was about to call security and--

62
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:45,753
This is the greatest single idea for
The Fabulous Super Race show yet!

63
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:49,629
Good thinking, J.W.,
you' re really on the ball.

64
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:53,154
Yes, Your Sparklyness, thank you.

65
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:56,039
I was sure you'd like it.

66
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:57,878
From the looks of this cat...

67
00:12:58,040 --> 00:13:02,079
...I'd be prepared to say he's the type
that would stop at nothing to win.

68
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:06,392
Absolutely. It's genius. People love
a rotten-to-the-core villain.

69
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:11,076
Someone who will do the things
they only dream about in order to win!

70
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:15,199
Remember, J.W., when in doubt,
always stoop as low as you can...

71
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:17,590
...and appeal
to people's basest instincts.

72
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:21,435
Gosh, thanks, Your Flashiness.
Right again.

73
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:23,676
Well, our work here is done, ladies.

74
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:28,755
Go forth, J.W. Globwobbler,
and bringeth in the ratings!

75
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:34,755
Well, I guess there
are two slots available.

76
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:37,593
Boys, you're hired.

77
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:40,110
Just sign on the dotted line, boys.

78
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:43,916
This will be the greatest reality game
show in the history of TV.

79
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:47,993
A show like this could make me
vice president of Hollywood.

80
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:03,078
These two are awful, sir.

81
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:05,914
Yep. It's perfect!

82
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:09,635
And we're live!

83
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:13,156
Well, hello, everybody out there
in television land...

84
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:15,788
...and welcome to
The Fabulous Super Race.

85
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:17,871
I'm Biff Buzzard.

86
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:23,512
And I'm Buzz Blister. We're here
in beautiful Detroit, Michigan--

87
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:28,750
We' re here in gorgeous
Hollywood, California!

88
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:31,593
That's right, Buzzer,
The Fabulous Super Race.

89
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:35,639
It should be more exciting than
anything mankind has yet experienced...

90
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:38,189
...in its brief time here
on planet Earth.

91
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:40,709
And speaking of planet Earth, Biffster...

92
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:43,633
...that's where our race is going
to take place.

93
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:48,112
Right, Buzzatola. The race begins
here in Southern California...

94
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:50,714
...and ends here in Mexico.

95
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:58,277
And this is the "keyako" that opens
the door to our terrific prize...

96
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:02,752
-...a huge giant mansion.
-She's a beauty, Buzz.

97
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:06,549
And she will go to the winner
of The Fabulous Super Race.

98
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:11,236
Let's get down to the pits and
meet our contestants right now.

99
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:15,239
You must be...?

100
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:17,436
Steed Dirkly at your service.

101
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:22,720
And I'd like to say hello to all of my fans
rooting for me, Steed Dirkly.

102
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:25,917
And might I just add
that all the proceeds I will win...

103
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:28,640
...will be donated
to my favorite charity.

104
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:31,190
And what might that be, Steed?

105
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:33,274
Me.

106
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:37,513
Well, I'm sure that warms the hearts
of America. Steed Dirkly...

107
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:40,319
...a true hero with a heart of gold.
Good luck.

108
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:44,150
Who have we got here, Buzz-A-Roo?

109
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:47,198
Why, it looks like a cute old grandma.

110
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:49,316
She looks just as cute and nice...

111
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:52,313
...and sweet and old
as she could be, doesn't she?

112
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:55,788
Why, thank you, sonny.

113
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:59,191
I'm one of those who believes
you're as young as you feel.

114
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:04,832
I have always been a fan of good
clean fun and honest competition.

115
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:11,512
And who's this cute little fella?

116
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:17,599
This is Squirty.
Oh, he's my whole world.

117
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:21,590
Squirty! Give the nice man
his finger back.

118
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:30,757
Animals just don't like you, Biff.
You've got to remember that.

119
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:35,477
Well, good luck, Grammy.
And good luck, Squirty.

120
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:53,476
And what is your name, sir?

121
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:57,676
I am Gorthan, Destroyer of Light.

122
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:00,948
I am nervous.
I've never been on TV before.

123
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:05,591
Really? Well, you're on TV now.
And where are you from, Mr. Destroyer?

124
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:08,638
I'm guessing, from the outfit,
Oakland, California!

125
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:13,271
I am from Niltor, near the outer alabaster
tower in the inner ring of green fire...

126
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:16,830
...in the dimension of darkness
ruled by the overlords of dread.

127
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:20,870
Nice. And what do you do in Niltor,
Mr. Destroyer?

128
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:23,554
I own a flower shop
and a greeting-card store.

129
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:24,989
I see.

130
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:29,035
And I suppose you're looking
for a shot at that big cash prize...

131
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:32,317
-...and that fabulous mansion.
-Y es, that would be nice.

132
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:35,278
One does grow weary
of the soul-crushing darkness...

133
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:38,273
...and endless screaming
that fill the air of Niltor.

134
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:40,874
Mr. Destroyer, I'm curious...

135
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:45,158
...what exactly powers this
strange-looking vehicle of yours?

136
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:49,479
It is powered by the anguish
of a thousand doomed souls.

137
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:55,677
It sounds like he has a soft spot
in his heart for the environment, folks.

138
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:59,150
Well, good luck, Gorthan,
Destroyer of Light.

139
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:00,958
Thank you, Biff.

140
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:05,796
And you must be...?

141
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:09,191
Hi! I'm Mallory
from Watertown, Wisconsin.

142
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:11,032
Everyone calls me Soccer Mom.

143
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:15,398
Okay, Soccer Mom. And you're here in
your souped-up minivan, is that right?

144
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:18,394
Y eah. You know, between school
and soccer games...

145
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:21,870
...and my online retail business,
I decided I needed a hobby.

146
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:25,510
Fantastic, Soccer Mom.
Your kids must be very proud.

147
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:30,356
Oh, yeah. Rufus, Gunter, Angus
and Shylock are all very proud.

148
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:32,636
All those boys must be a handful.

149
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:37,197
No, Angus is a girl. Hi, kids!
Don't forget to water the sheep!

150
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:40,989
Oh, and no swordplay in the house
while Mommy's gone, okay?

151
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:46,274
Well, as the French say,
bueno el lucko to you, Soccer Mom.

152
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:50,559
And that brings us to...?

153
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:52,790
I am Dr. Professor...

154
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,116
...a super-resourceful genius.

155
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:58,113
And I will no doubt be
the winner of this race.

156
00:18:58,280 --> 00:19:02,114
As we all know, science is golden.

157
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:06,439
That looks like a pretty sophisticated
piece of machinery...

158
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:08,795
-...you have there, doctor.
-Yes, it is.

159
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:13,316
And what kind of gas does it take?

160
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:17,789
-Antimatter.
-lsn't that the most explosive...

161
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:20,952
...and powerful energy source
known to mankind?

162
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:25,750
This is it. My own specially designed
antimatter engine. I never have to refuel.

163
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:28,832
It uses the most efficient
and powerful fuel source.

164
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:32,430
So, what happens if this stuff
touches matter?

165
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:35,558
It would instantly vaporize anything
in its vicinity.

166
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:37,791
What's this little thingy here do?

167
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:39,479
No! Don't touch that!

168
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:46,874
That technology thing is certainly
moving fast, isn't it, Biff?

169
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:48,439
Boy, I'll say.

170
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:56,477
And here we have a pussycat
and a mouse.

171
00:19:57,160 --> 00:20:00,038
I didn't realize that vermin
were eligible, Biff.

172
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:04,159
And who on earth gave this pussycat
a driver's license?

173
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:11,799
And what do you two have to say
to our viewers at home?

174
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:17,996
That's right. They're animals, Biff,
and they can't talk.

175
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:20,833
No, sir, but apparently they can drive.

176
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:24,476
Hey! Look at this
little mouse-sized car.

177
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:28,632
It's cute.

178
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:32,157
What can you get this baby up
to, little mouse? Four?

179
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:36,919
-"Four. "
-What's this little button here do?

180
00:20:55,520 --> 00:21:00,469
Okay. Okay, folks. With that,
we are ready to get underway.

181
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:06,431
And we'll see you all
at the finish line in Mexico.

182
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:39,436
And there they go!

183
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:18,909
Attaboy, Squirty!

184
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:30,553
Our contestants are going to have
to employ the first of their vehicles'...

185
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:35,350
...special modifications to get around
this notorious Southern California traffic.

186
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:40,793
And it looks like
they are doing just that, Biff.

187
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:12,390
Okay. I know just what to do now.

188
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:51,352
Hey, what's that pussycat up to, Biff?

189
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:54,193
No good it looks like to me, Buzz.

190
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:29,639
-That was a close one, Buzz.
-That pussycat is dynamite!

191
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:11,070
Well, it looks like pretty boy
is gaining, Squirty.

192
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:28,034
Squirty! No! Bad dog!

193
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:39,317
Oh, Squirty! No! Drop it! Drop it!

194
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:35,355
This naughty pussycat would do well
in the pits of Niltor.

195
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:39,513
Perhaps one of my stink pods will
give him a taste of his own medicine.

196
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:02,874
It's a hit, sir!

197
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:06,868
It's an ultra, super,
dynamic mega hit, lrving!

198
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:08,996
We can't end this thing in Mexico!

199
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:11,799
Call the crew, tell them
to move the finish line.

200
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:13,632
To where, sir?

201
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:17,588
Irving, which one of these shapes
is Mexico?

202
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:20,797
-This one here, sir.
-Let's see...

203
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:23,958
...how about if we take them to....

204
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:29,795
And here come the racers, Buzz!

205
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:52,196
Hey, I won! Give me that key.

206
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:54,430
Not so fast.

207
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:00,316
Was that a speed bump?

208
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:06,112
Oh, heavenly days. Did I win?

209
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:19,518
Now, don't get too excited there, racers.

210
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:23,036
We've just received word
from our Hollywood studio...

211
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:27,432
...that due to high ratings, The Fabulous
Super Race is going to be extended.

212
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:30,398
The next finish line
is located deep in the heart...

213
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:35,190
-...of the Amazon jungle.
-What? What are you talking about?

214
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:36,952
Isn't that great?

215
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:19,271
Hello again, folks.

216
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:24,434
Buzz Blister here in the heart of
the Amazon jungle with my cohost, Biff.

217
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:27,353
Our racers are forging
intrepidly ahead through...

218
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:30,671
...this dense jungle on their way
to this very unstable...

219
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:32,637
...and rickety-looking bridge.

220
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:34,518
Here come our racers!

221
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:37,558
Oh, it looks like Steed Dirkly.

222
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:47,272
That was a close one, Buzz.

223
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:49,749
Y es, it sure was, Biff.
And here comes--

224
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:51,353
Oh, it looks like Grammy.

225
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:54,796
I hope she can negotiate the bridge
with those slats missing.

226
00:29:57,280 --> 00:30:00,033
I'm right on your tail, pretty boy!

227
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:04,798
Oh, no! It looks like
Grammy's in trouble, Buzz!

228
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:08,748
It certainly does. And it's just too bad
that the rules prevent us...

229
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:12,629
...from coming to the rescue
of that sweet, very old lady.

230
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:15,519
No, that would be cheating, Buzz.

231
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:20,117
So if this lady snaps through the rotten
wooden slats of this ancient bridge...

232
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:24,512
...and falls to her doom,
we'll just have to go to a commercial.

233
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:27,519
She just seems so helpless and delicate.

234
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:31,710
So weak, so scrawny.

235
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:34,075
So noodly and frothy.

236
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:36,708
So crunchy and creamy.

237
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,991
Pretty impressive.

238
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:43,512
Hey! Looks like Gorthan, Destroyer of
Light, is making his crossing now.

239
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:59,834
-Gorthan's in trouble, Biff!
-Wow, he sure is, Buzz!

240
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:04,471
That heavy metal car of his may be
too much for that old bridge to handle.

241
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:15,435
Knargack the Black-Winged...

242
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:19,115
...I summon thee to appear
and use thine hideous powers...

243
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:22,352
...to lifteth me-eth over
this obstacle-eth.

244
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:38,515
Gorthan, that was some trick!

245
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:40,910
Did you train that bird yourself?

246
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:44,629
Oh, no. Knargack's soul belongs
to that of a vanquished foe...

247
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:47,155
...who's now trapped
and forced to serve.

248
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:50,039
Can it talk? Could we get
an interview with it?

249
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:52,589
I have to get going.
I'm falling behind.

250
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:57,436
Right. Well, good to see you again,
Gorthan, Destroyer of Light.

251
00:31:57,720 --> 00:32:00,314
Thank you, Buzz.
Always great to see you.

252
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:05,872
I wouldn't have pegged him
as an animal lover.

253
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:08,600
I wonder who will be next, Biff.

254
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:31,994
That's funny. That doesn't look
like what's on my map, not at all.

255
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:34,720
Oh, well, signs don't lie.

256
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:48,309
Oh, darn. I just had this washed.
I'd better call GoneStar.

257
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:55,033
Hello. Thank you for calling GoneStar's
remote assistance department.

258
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:57,873
My name is Dave.
Would you like to subscribe...

259
00:32:58,040 --> 00:33:01,715
-... to our free music download offer?
-Oh, no, thank you, Dave.

260
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:04,155
See, I have an emergency going on now.

261
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:07,318
I see. Well, let me locate you
on my screen.

262
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:10,557
You are Mallory MacDoogle,
a soccer mom.

263
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:13,837
I have you pinpointed in a remote
and unexplored region...

264
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,672
... of the Amazonian jungle.

265
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:19,077
-And what seems to be the trouble?
-See now, that's just it.

266
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:22,755
I' m sinking in deadly quicksand
and I need help getting out now.

267
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:24,996
I'm afraid I can 't do that, Mallory.

268
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:30,551
Just kidding. Well, let's consult
our GoneStar quicksand computer...

269
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:33,109
...and see if we can 't
get you out of there.

270
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:35,510
Simply follow the prompts
on your screen.

271
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:42,714
There are many types of quicksand
on our interesting planet.

272
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:48,352
There is desert quicksand,
swamp quicksand and jungle quicksand.

273
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:52,708
You have selected jungle quicksand.

274
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:55,429
Now please choose
the jungle you are in.

275
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:59,275
Are you in A, the Belgian Congo...

276
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:04,912
...B, a Southeast Asian jungle
or C, the Amazonian jungle?

277
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:06,553
Amazonian, yeah.

278
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:10,952
Now choose what you would like to do
with the quicksand you have selected.

279
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:17,309
Would you like to A, make quicksand,
B, garden with quicksand...

280
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:20,756
... or C, get out of quicksand?

281
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:27,075
To get out, press--

282
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:37,429
Wait a ding-dang minute here.

283
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:40,991
You know, I think somebody
might've done this on purpose.

284
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:46,552
Oh, no, don't go that way, little mouse.
The race is this way, yeah!

285
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:49,518
My van sank in the quicksand,
so I guess I'm out.

286
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:53,952
Here, have an orange.
It will give you energy.

287
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:56,117
Good luck!

288
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:09,315
-Too bad about Soccer Mom, Buzz.
-Yes, I was kind of rooting for her.

289
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:23,198
But what's this?
That crazy pussycat...

290
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:26,557
...has stopped at the end of the bridge.
He's got a saw.

291
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:29,792
I sense a dirty trick coming up.

292
00:35:57,400 --> 00:36:00,312
Looks like that one backfired
on the pussycat.

293
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:02,391
It sure does, Buzzalito.

294
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:07,793
And this river is infested with
pussycat-eating piranha fish.

295
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:16,630
-That's Tierra del Fuego, sir.
-And that?

296
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:18,756
That would be the Antarctic, sir.

297
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:20,309
Fantastic!

298
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:25,076
The racers will have to modify their cars
and sail across water to make it there.

299
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:28,956
That should boost the ratings
even higher!

300
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:33,752
Folks, I've just heard from Hollywood
and have received some terrific news...

301
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:36,957
...that I'm sure our racers
will be pleased to hear!

302
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:41,079
Our racers are now going to head for
the southernmost tip of South America...

303
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:44,232
...where they will prepare
for the difficult crossing...

304
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:46,868
...from Cape Horn to the Antarctic.

305
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:51,636
And won't our racers be excited
and happy to hear that!

306
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:54,435
And here they come!

307
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:59,909
-Give me that key!
-Not so fast, Steed.

308
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:02,389
Biff has some news for you all!

309
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:05,199
That's right, all. The race
has been extended.

310
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:10,559
And we will see each and all of you
in the Antarctic! Good luck, everyone!

311
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:26,112
Avast, Squirty!

312
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:30,717
It'll take more than a little drizzle
to keep us from winning.

313
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:37,478
This reminds me of sailing
Blood Blister Bay back in Niltor.

314
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:56,472
No, this is terrible. Stop sinking!

315
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:05,997
Well, maybe this isn't so bad after all.

316
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:13,317
Well, Miss Mermaid...

317
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:18,793
...you are in luck. Because Steed Dirkly
has just washed upon your shore.

318
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:22,350
And as soon as you dry
these damp clothes, I'll reward you...

319
00:38:22,520 --> 00:38:24,351
...by letting you fix my dinner.

320
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:35,830
Hey, this just in, Biffo.

321
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:39,037
Oh, some disappointing news
from the Southern Atlantic.

322
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:43,318
It seems Steed Dirkly is being parboiled
in a briny bouillabaisse...

323
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:46,233
...and served
with a caper dill cream mousseline.

324
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:51,111
Buzzby, he's out of the race.
But he sounds delicious.

325
00:38:57,960 --> 00:39:03,910
Well, Gorthan, congratulations on being
the first one to make it to the Antarctic.

326
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:05,752
Thank you, Buzz. And hello, Biff.

327
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:08,309
Say, Gorthan, have you ever heard
that thing...

328
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:12,632
...about sticking your tongue
on a piece of frozen metal?

329
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:14,353
No. What do you mean?

330
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:17,273
Well, Gorthan, they say
if you touch your tongue...

331
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:20,637
...on a frozen piece of metal,
it will stick.

332
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:23,793
-What?
-Yes. What do you think, Gorthan?

333
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:25,439
Will it stick, yes or no?

334
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:29,275
Well, no, that's nonsense.
The answer is no. It wouldn't stick.

335
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:33,399
Well, what about putting your money
where your mouth is, Gorthan?

336
00:39:33,560 --> 00:39:36,916
-What do you mean?
-Well, we have the south pole right here.

337
00:39:37,080 --> 00:39:38,229
Why not give it a try?

338
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:41,756
What? You mean, stick my tongue
on this stupid metal pole here?

339
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:46,836
Who would have thought that
the so-called Destroyer of Light...

340
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:50,879
-...was really just a big wimp.
-Look, I'm warning you!

341
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:55,795
No need to resort to evil magic, Gorthan.
If you think your tongue won't stick...

342
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:57,473
...just go ahead and show us.

343
00:39:58,200 --> 00:40:02,990
All right. If only to prove to you mortals
that you are wrong! Here.

344
00:40:03,160 --> 00:40:05,276
Well, go on, Gorthan.

345
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:07,829
I'm doing it, I'm doing it.

346
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:11,313
There. You see? I told you.

347
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:17,917
-Told you.
-I knew it.

348
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:20,631
Hey, Buzz, look.

349
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:22,438
The ice is cracking.

350
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:26,991
Gosh, you're right, Biff-O-Rama.
Let's hop over to safety.

351
00:40:27,160 --> 00:40:31,312
Hey, what about me? Come on, fellas.

352
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:36,319
And it looks like Gorthan
is out of the race.

353
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:38,118
It sure does, Buzzo.

354
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:41,955
But at least we proved once and for all
that your tongue will stick...

355
00:40:42,120 --> 00:40:46,238
-...to a metal pole if it's cold enough.
-And that's something.

356
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:50,078
I curse your souls, mortals!

357
00:40:51,720 --> 00:40:54,996
Boy, somebody sure is a sore loser.

358
00:40:55,160 --> 00:40:59,199
That leaves the pussycat, the mouse
and, of course, Grammy.

359
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:00,918
Yes. And here they are.

360
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:06,314
Let's have a word with Grammy.

361
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:09,119
Say, Grammy,
I'm sure the folks at home...

362
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:12,636
...would like to know how you feel
about the race thus far.

363
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:16,318
Well, it's a wonderful competition.

364
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:19,040
It's good for a person to participate...

365
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:23,193
...in old-fashioned, clean,
wholesome fun!

366
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:04,955
Squirty. Squirty!

367
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:07,954
Grammy's coming!

368
00:42:09,080 --> 00:42:10,718
Mr. Pussycat...

369
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:15,078
...how are you going to sleep at night
after a rotten trick like that?

370
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,958
I think he'll sleep just fine, Buzz.

371
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:25,432
Looks like the pussycat is in the lead.

372
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:32,953
Well, it seems we are down
to only two competitors now, Biffy.

373
00:42:33,120 --> 00:42:35,190
That's right. A cat and a mouse.

374
00:42:35,360 --> 00:42:37,032
A predator and the prey.

375
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:40,795
-The overdog and the underdog.
-The eater and the eaten.

376
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:45,511
-The big and the small.
-Okay, Biff, I think we get the idea.

377
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:12,558
Just take a look at the ratings
for the show, sir.

378
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:15,110
Holy cow, they're through the roof!

379
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:19,273
If this doesn't make me vice president
of Hollywood, I don't know what will.

380
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:20,589
We gotta keep this up.

381
00:44:20,760 --> 00:44:23,832
What can we do to make the show
more exciting? Where are they?

382
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:27,436
They're racing across the Antarctic.
The next stop is Australia.

383
00:44:27,600 --> 00:44:31,798
Australia, huh?
Isn't that where Mozart is from?

384
00:44:31,960 --> 00:44:33,439
No. That's Austria, sir.

385
00:44:33,600 --> 00:44:36,797
Oh, right. So how should we
have them get there?

386
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:39,838
Well, standard procedure
is to fly or sail, sir.

387
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:43,197
You gotta learn how to think
out of the box, lrving.

388
00:44:43,360 --> 00:44:47,319
But how else would they get there?
There's an enormous body of water...

389
00:44:47,480 --> 00:44:50,870
-...between the Antarctic and Australia.
-Precisely.

390
00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:54,715
-You mean...?
-Yes, keep going.

391
00:44:56,040 --> 00:44:58,554
-Underwater, sir?
-Bingo!

392
00:44:58,720 --> 00:45:02,110
That's the kind of thinking
that will keep you out of the mailroom.

393
00:45:02,280 --> 00:45:07,479
The leg of the race between Antarctica
and Australia will be held underwater.

394
00:45:07,640 --> 00:45:09,358
It'll be a television first.

395
00:45:09,520 --> 00:45:12,956
Let's just see how high
we can get these ratings to go.

396
00:46:26,280 --> 00:46:30,432
Well, I see the mouse, Buzz,
but no sign of the pussyc-- Wait!

397
00:46:30,600 --> 00:46:34,559
His car is there, but the pussycat
is not in the vehicle.

398
00:46:34,720 --> 00:46:40,352
As we all know, the contestant must be
in his vehicle in order to stay in the race.

399
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:46,072
Congratulations, Mr. Mouse!
You have taken the lead.

400
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:50,475
You're that much closer
to owning your very own mansion.

401
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:52,756
Now it's time to modify your vehicle...

402
00:46:52,920 --> 00:46:57,118
...because the next leg of the race
to Australia is taking place.

403
00:46:57,280 --> 00:46:59,157
Underwater.

404
00:47:13,880 --> 00:47:15,632
T ough break for the pussycat.

405
00:47:15,800 --> 00:47:20,316
Yes, cats don't like water at all.
Especially this one.

406
00:50:17,600 --> 00:50:20,592
Mr. Globwobbler, sir,
the pussycat is out of the race.

407
00:50:20,760 --> 00:50:24,799
I love that cat. That backstabbing
feline drove our ratings through the roof.

408
00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:28,999
-Get him back in the race!
-Y es, sir.

409
00:50:40,600 --> 00:50:43,592
T ake it easy, Punchy. Oh, we're on.

410
00:50:43,760 --> 00:50:46,718
G'day all you mates and sheilas.
We're here--

411
00:50:46,880 --> 00:50:49,269
Biff, no, it's "g'day. "

412
00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:51,635
Like, duh, you pronounce
the "guh" sound.

413
00:50:54,040 --> 00:50:57,430
Well, now I'm all self-conscious
and it sounds weird to me.

414
00:50:57,600 --> 00:50:59,192
I think you better do it.

415
00:50:59,360 --> 00:51:01,510
All right. Then here, you take Punchy.

416
00:51:01,680 --> 00:51:05,878
I don't think this kangaroo
likes me very much, Buzz.

417
00:51:06,080 --> 00:51:08,640
Nonsense. Take the leash.
G'day, folks.

418
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:14,750
We're here down under in beautiful, hot,
humid, bug-infested Australia.

419
00:51:14,920 --> 00:51:19,675
And, folks, say hello to our Australian
ambassador of good will, Punchy...

420
00:51:19,840 --> 00:51:23,196
...the boxing kangaroo.
Isn't he cute, folks?

421
00:51:23,360 --> 00:51:25,715
He's adorable. G'day.

422
00:51:25,880 --> 00:51:30,954
The next portion of the race
will take place in the rugged outback.

423
00:51:31,120 --> 00:51:32,997
Isn't that right, Biff?

424
00:51:35,200 --> 00:51:39,990
Then on north up to Weipa
in the northernmost portion of Australia.

425
00:51:40,280 --> 00:51:43,317
The next leg of our race is about
to begin. Here they come!

426
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:50,311
It looks like Grammy.

427
00:51:50,480 --> 00:51:51,754
Yes. And that's amazing.

428
00:51:51,920 --> 00:51:55,390
Because the last time we saw her,
she had been eaten by a whale.

429
00:51:55,560 --> 00:51:57,630
Never underestimate the elderly, Buzz.

430
00:51:57,800 --> 00:51:59,518
Especially Grammy.

431
00:51:59,680 --> 00:52:03,958
No, sir. This old bat
is full of surprises.

432
00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:08,916
Hey, it's the mouse.

433
00:52:13,440 --> 00:52:16,159
Any sign of the pussycat,
Mr. Mouse?

434
00:52:17,280 --> 00:52:19,669
I think it's curtains
for the pussycat, Buzz.

435
00:52:19,840 --> 00:52:24,470
And that's too bad. His rotten attitude
was making this race so exciting.

436
00:52:24,640 --> 00:52:26,710
Well, good luck, rodent.

437
00:52:42,880 --> 00:52:45,440
Oh, my little spud! I love you!

438
00:52:45,880 --> 00:52:47,836
Let's burn rubber, Squirty!

439
00:52:56,400 --> 00:52:58,675
Wait a minute, Biff, what's that?

440
00:53:09,760 --> 00:53:15,357
Well, Biff, it looks like the network
has taken a liking to a certain pussycat.

441
00:53:15,520 --> 00:53:17,476
Why bother? He can't win.

442
00:53:17,640 --> 00:53:21,553
Grammy and the rodent
are already halfway across Australia.

443
00:53:21,720 --> 00:53:25,429
Y es. I think we can stick a fork
in the pussycat, because he's toast.

444
00:53:25,600 --> 00:53:27,989
And so is his car.

445
00:53:37,280 --> 00:53:40,829
Well, it's always encouraging
to see a guy who won't give up.

446
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:43,036
Yes. But this case is hopeless.

447
00:53:43,200 --> 00:53:46,397
There's no way the pussycat
will be able to make up the gap...

448
00:53:46,560 --> 00:53:48,471
...between the mouse and Grammy.

449
00:53:48,640 --> 00:53:54,351
Yes. He'd pretty much have to saw
the entire continent of Australia in half.

450
00:53:54,520 --> 00:53:57,273
And that's extremely unlikely.

451
00:53:57,440 --> 00:53:59,954
Well, I'll be a monkey's uncle.

452
00:54:03,640 --> 00:54:05,073
No! He's not gonna--

453
00:54:05,240 --> 00:54:11,031
He sure is gonna. That crazy pussycat
is going to saw Australia in half.

454
00:54:11,200 --> 00:54:15,716
-How about that, folks?
-That's some determined pussycat.

455
00:54:15,960 --> 00:54:18,793
I'll say, Biff. We'd better get off
this continent...

456
00:54:18,960 --> 00:54:22,032
...before it sinks to the bottom
of Davy Jones' Locker.

457
00:54:42,240 --> 00:54:46,028
Oh, you rotten, dirty pussycat.

458
00:55:31,800 --> 00:55:35,190
Well, it serves you right,
you naughty pussycat.

459
00:56:49,320 --> 00:56:52,630
We're going down, Squirty.
Quick, the parachutes!

460
00:57:02,040 --> 00:57:04,600
Why, you ungrateful little stinker.

461
00:57:04,760 --> 00:57:08,116
If it weren't for me,
you'd still be at the animal-testing lab...

462
00:57:08,280 --> 00:57:13,070
...having antiperspirant sprayed
in your eyes and drinking paint.

463
00:57:19,920 --> 00:57:21,592
Geronimo!

464
00:57:24,320 --> 00:57:27,835
Open the chute, Squirty.
Open the chute!

465
00:57:31,080 --> 00:57:32,718
Oh, Squirty, I can't....

466
00:58:27,200 --> 00:58:30,237
Sir, Grammy is out of the race.
The pussycat did her in.

467
00:58:30,400 --> 00:58:34,598
-It's just him and the mouse now.
-This whole caper is falling apart.

468
00:58:34,760 --> 00:58:37,433
Listen up, lrving.
This race is taking too long.

469
00:58:37,600 --> 00:58:41,115
The public have the attention span
of a cocker spaniel.

470
00:58:41,280 --> 00:58:46,832
You'd better speed up the last leg of
the race or your sorry butt goes bye-bye.

471
00:58:47,520 --> 00:58:52,275
But we told the public this race would go
through the greatest cities in the world.

472
00:58:52,440 --> 00:58:55,000
And we haven't even been
to Cleveland yet.

473
00:58:55,160 --> 00:58:58,152
Irving, the public doesn't want
a bunch of pretty cities.

474
00:58:58,320 --> 00:59:01,949
They want action.
Action and plenty of explosions.

475
00:59:02,120 --> 00:59:05,351
Now, I want this race wrapped up
in five minutes, lrving...

476
00:59:05,520 --> 00:59:09,593
-...or you'll find yourself sorting mail.
-Yes, sir.

477
00:59:15,960 --> 00:59:19,794
Well, it looks like the lower life forms
have taken the lead.

478
00:59:19,960 --> 00:59:22,713
That's right, Buzz-Buzz,
and just as well.

479
00:59:22,880 --> 00:59:25,678
I think they've done something
for the self-esteem...

480
00:59:25,840 --> 00:59:29,276
...of fur-covered animals everywhere.

481
00:59:44,640 --> 00:59:48,872
Tom and Jerry, as the only
surviving drivers in our Super Race...

482
00:59:49,040 --> 00:59:55,195
...we're giving you two nuclear-powered,
rocket-car, jet-plane, hovercraft things.

483
00:59:57,840 --> 01:00:00,957
And there's a teensy change in plans.

484
01:00:01,120 --> 01:00:03,680
You've only got five minutes
to finish the race!

485
01:00:05,760 --> 01:00:09,548
That's right.
Once you racers leave Borneo...

486
01:00:09,720 --> 01:00:15,317
...you'll cross Europe and the
Atlantic Ocean to the good old U.S. of A.

487
01:00:15,480 --> 01:00:20,474
There you'll cross the continent to reach
the finish line in Hollywood, California...

488
01:00:20,640 --> 01:00:22,676
...in five minutes!

489
01:00:38,160 --> 01:00:42,119
So good luck.
And may the best lower species win.

490
01:03:36,760 --> 01:03:41,038
Biffette, we're here at the finish line,
where the crowd waits anxiously...

491
01:03:41,200 --> 01:03:44,158
...to see if the winner
will be the cat or the mouse.

492
01:04:05,120 --> 01:04:06,553
Holy smokes, folks.

493
01:04:06,720 --> 01:04:09,075
We can hear them heading
right this way.

494
01:04:09,280 --> 01:04:12,317
They're neck and neck.
Isn't that right, Biff?

495
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:14,115
That's right.

496
01:04:14,280 --> 01:04:18,034
I too can hardly speak anything articulate
with all this excitement.

497
01:04:18,200 --> 01:04:22,876
At those speeds, how long do you think
it'll take them to reach the finish line?

498
01:04:24,800 --> 01:04:29,749
I'm with you. It's hard to form even
a simple sentence with this excitement.

499
01:04:29,920 --> 01:04:33,674
But who will win? The cat or the mouse?
Feline or rodent? Pet or pest?

500
01:04:33,840 --> 01:04:37,913
The couch-scratcher
or the cheese-nibbler? Who, Biff, who?

501
01:04:54,600 --> 01:04:58,752
And here they come, folks. What
an incredible final lap. Right, Biffaroni?

502
01:05:20,280 --> 01:05:24,159
And they're a mere 5 feet from
the finish line. And in the lead is T om.

503
01:05:24,320 --> 01:05:27,039
No, Jerry. No, Tom. No, Jerry!

504
01:05:28,280 --> 01:05:30,874
Tom. Jerry. Tom. Jerry.

505
01:05:31,520 --> 01:05:33,431
Tom! Jer--

506
01:05:34,240 --> 01:05:37,118
T! J!

507
01:05:43,360 --> 01:05:45,954
-It's a tie!
-It's a tie!

508
01:05:54,520 --> 01:05:58,274
Congratulations, boys.
I've got good news and bad news.

509
01:05:58,440 --> 01:06:02,274
The good news is, you just finished
the most spectacular race in history.

510
01:06:02,840 --> 01:06:06,389
The bad news is, it's a tie.

511
01:06:06,560 --> 01:06:10,075
And your contract says
you'll both have to do the race...

512
01:06:10,240 --> 01:06:12,629
...all over again.

513
01:06:50,560 --> 01:06:56,795
From now on, Hollywood is going
to stand for morality, wholesomeness...

514
01:06:56,960 --> 01:07:00,430
...good, clean, family entertainment.

515
01:07:01,080 --> 01:07:03,036
What's gotten into him?

516
01:07:03,240 --> 01:07:07,153
We can't have that kind of attitude
in Hollywood.

517
01:07:10,640 --> 01:07:13,757
Well, today is your lucky day, lrving.

518
01:07:13,920 --> 01:07:18,516
Or should I say new head
of Globwobbler Studios!

519
01:07:20,240 --> 01:07:23,835
Gosh. Head of Globwobbler Studios.

520
01:07:45,440 --> 01:07:48,557
Well, how nice of you
to get me a new home...

521
01:07:48,720 --> 01:07:52,190
...since you wrecked my old one.
And while we're--

522
01:07:52,360 --> 01:07:56,353
Tom, there's that mouse again.
Get that mouse out of our house!

523
01:07:56,520 --> 01:08:02,277
Well, don't just stand there,
do something! Get going! Go on, hurry!

524
01:08:02,440 --> 01:08:05,000
Get that mouse out!
