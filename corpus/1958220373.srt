The active learning defense
system we are testing,

3
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:57,407
continues to operate flawlessly.

4
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:00,995
One might even say miraculously,

5
00:02:01,321 --> 00:02:05,452
we are navigating under the
Arctic ice cup by Ted Ragony.

00:02:05,594 --> 00:02:07,141
and five days from home.

7
00:02:07,521 --> 00:02:09,947
After 25,000 nautical miles,

8
00:02:10,274 --> 00:02:14,867
the Sevastopol has deliberately approached
every navy in the world

9
00:02:14,937 --> 00:02:17,896
and remained completely undetected.

10
00:02:19,662 --> 00:02:21,933
The Patkova stealth capability..

11
00:02:22,023 --> 00:02:24,716
has exceeded all expectations.

12
00:02:30,653 --> 00:02:34,893
We are at this moment
the state of the art...

13
00:02:34,946 --> 00:02:36,306
of war.

14
00:02:40,272 --> 00:02:45,432
The most fearsome killing machine ever
devised by man,

15
00:02:47,066 --> 00:02:50,772
and we are impossible to find.

16
00:02:53,651 --> 00:02:57,158
Captain, we have a submerged contact
 designated Semyon 83,

17
00:02:57,158 --> 00:02:59,612
exhibiting tools of the US Virginia
class submarine,

on a standard of battle.

24
00:03:22,456 --> 00:03:23,935
- Captain has the call.
- Yes sir.

25
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:25,996
Coming to course 1-0-0, ready on
course 1-0-0, weapons officer ready.

Ordinance Commander, Distance?

28
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:47,238
Mining solution is tracking at
a distance of 15,000 meters.

29
00:03:47,263 --> 00:03:50,449
Sir, that doesn't make sense,
tunnel is this loud and clear?

30
00:03:51,143 --> 00:03:52,403
It must be close to the back.

31
00:03:53,803 --> 00:03:57,749
Captain, firing solution just to
the step change to 10,000 meters.

32
00:03:58,636 --> 00:03:59,960
Nothing moves that fast.

33
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:02,238
All solutions are matching,
the range is true.

34
00:04:02,263 --> 00:04:04,656
Hell, right full, rather to course 2-7-0.

35
00:04:04,681 --> 00:04:07,068
Course 2-7-0, aye.

36
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:12,141
We'll just walk away
and head for deep water.

37
00:04:12,475 --> 00:04:14,837
Contact bearing 1-6-0.

38
00:04:14,837 --> 00:04:16,517
Bearing value zero?

39
00:04:16,777 --> 00:04:19,163
He's there, turning with us again.

40
00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:21,557
He can see us.

41
00:04:22,236 --> 00:04:24,189
Impossible, we're invisible.

42
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:26,960
Weapon, round diagnostics
and sonar and fire control.

43
00:04:27,089 --> 00:04:27,960
Something is arriving.

44
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:29,935
Sir, he's flooding his torpedo tubes.

45
00:04:31,211 --> 00:04:33,960
- The torpedo room gone, hold on torpedo tubes.
- Aye sir.

46
00:04:37,311 --> 00:04:39,391

50
00:04:46,784 --> 00:04:49,000
Weapons, flood tubes 1 to 4 and open out the doors.

51
00:04:49,025 --> 00:04:50,960
Enter firing solution into tube 2.

52
00:04:51,058 --> 00:04:53,858
I get it. Making tube 2 ready
in other space.

53
00:04:53,883 --> 00:04:55,247
Captain, pace provoking us.

54
00:04:55,272 --> 00:04:57,449
He wants an excuse to blow us
out of the water.

55
00:04:57,474 --> 00:04:59,960
Enemy to be doing the water bearing Q-0-0.

Hell, left full, rather all ahead flash, cabin.

58
00:05:03,576 --> 00:05:06,529
A is left full.
Entering all ahead, flying cavity.

59
00:05:06,554 --> 00:05:07,554
Don't scatter measures.

60
00:05:07,579 --> 00:05:08,579
Launching countermeasures.

61
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:13,040
Fire tube 2.

62
00:05:13,065 --> 00:05:14,038
Fire tube 2.

63
00:05:17,451 --> 00:05:18,559
The torpedo on the away.

64
00:05:18,584 --> 00:05:19,099
Running hot.

65
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:22,960
Enemy torpedo still homing.

66
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:25,000
Range, 800 meters.

67
00:05:25,025 --> 00:05:26,373
He's blown through our countermeasures.

68
00:05:26,398 --> 00:05:28,512
- Hell, right full, rather.
- Right full, aye sir.

69
00:05:28,585 --> 00:05:29,638
600 meters.

70
00:05:29,663 --> 00:05:32,086
Stand by to emergency blow
all main balusters.

71
00:05:32,111 --> 00:05:32,960
400 meters.

72
00:05:32,985 --> 00:05:34,960
Commander of the watch, stand by
 for collision alert.

73
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:35,960
200 meters.

74
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:37,278
This is the captain all ahead.

75
00:05:37,303 --> 00:05:39,304
Enemy torpedo impacting.

76
00:05:39,329 --> 00:05:40,389
Five

77
00:05:40,694 --> 00:05:41,694
Four

78
00:05:42,216 --> 00:05:43,216

One

81
00:05:46,716 --> 00:05:47,716
Impact!

82
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:00,108
What just happened?

83
00:06:00,133 --> 00:06:01,401
It's gone.

84
00:06:01,599 --> 00:06:03,742
- It missed us?
- No.

85
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:04,960
It vanished.

86
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:06,960
Like it was never there.

87
00:06:07,137 --> 00:06:09,630
Sola, where is the enemy vessel?

88
00:06:09,655 --> 00:06:12,592
Bearing 3-5-0 4,000 meters
of a starboard bow.

89
00:06:12,617 --> 00:06:13,960
Our torpedo is running through.

90
00:06:14,337 --> 00:06:16,677
Impact with enemy submarine in.

One

94
00:06:24,596 --> 00:06:25,731
Where was the impact?

95
00:06:25,756 --> 00:06:27,960
Captain, enemy submarine has vanished.

96
00:06:28,651 --> 00:06:29,960
It's gone, sir.

97
00:06:30,317 --> 00:06:31,717
I don't understand.

98
00:06:37,591 --> 00:06:38,960
It was never there.

99
00:06:41,685 --> 00:06:42,960
We've been chasing your father.

100
00:06:43,231 --> 00:06:44,845
It was right there.

101
00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:47,960
- The instruments don't lie.
- They lie to us today.

102
00:06:48,375 --> 00:06:48,960
Weapons.

103
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:50,722
Shut down our torpedo.

104
00:06:50,747 --> 00:06:51,708
Aye, captain.

105
00:06:51,733 --> 00:06:52,960
Shutting down torpedo.

106
00:06:53,298 --> 00:06:55,358
Secure from battle stage.

107
00:06:58,618 --> 00:07:00,355
This is why we have sea trials.

108
00:07:01,512 --> 00:07:03,359
There's a bug in the system.

109
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:06,833
A ghost in a machine.

110
00:07:09,303 --> 00:07:10,960
- It's time to go home.
- Captian!

111
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:12,960
Our torpedo is not responding.

112
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:13,960
It's coming right at us.

113
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:16,960
Our torpedo is holding range 400 meters.

114
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:17,960
Aye, come on.

115
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:19,750
Shut down our weapons.

00:07:20,243 --> 00:07:23,375
Our torpedo is still closing.

Fuck.

119
00:08:56,513 --> 00:08:57,640
Hey, delivery?

120
00:09:07,472 --> 00:09:08,472
Hello?

121
00:09:17,419 --> 00:09:18,086
That's a gnatum.

122
00:09:18,825 --> 00:09:19,393
Easy.

123
00:09:21,313 --> 00:09:21,826
Easy.

124
00:09:24,824 --> 00:09:25,496
Easy.

125
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,800
India's Zulu 254.

126
00:09:31,746 --> 00:09:33,766
Bravo Echo 101.

127
00:09:35,763 --> 00:09:36,870
Now, I'm

128
00:09:37,084 --> 00:09:38,670
need you to ask me
the security question first.

129
00:09:39,313 --> 00:09:40,313
Oh yeah, Sorry.

130
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:44,960
What is the ice?

131
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:51,960
We live and die in the shadows.

132
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:55,960
For those we hold close.

133
00:09:57,299 --> 00:09:58,911
For those we never meet.

134
00:10:03,259 --> 00:10:04,464
You can put it on the table.

135
00:10:19,959 --> 00:10:20,519
Hey.

136
00:10:24,739 --> 00:10:25,899
Welcome to IMF.

137
00:10:28,279 --> 00:10:29,519
You made the right choice.

138
00:10:33,671 --> 00:10:34,195
Son.

139
00:10:40,173 --> 00:10:41,701
Good evening, Mr. Hunt.

140
00:10:43,466 --> 00:10:44,824
It's been a long time.

141
00:10:46,259 --> 00:10:49,078
Our lives are the sum of our choices.

142
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:51,960
And we cannot escape the past.

143
00:10:53,328 --> 00:10:56,078
30 years ago, you were offered two choices.

144
00:10:56,353 --> 00:10:59,771
Join the IMF or spend your life in prison.

145
00:11:01,304 --> 00:11:05,071
Because of your unique natural talents,
your government forgave you.

146
00:11:05,591 --> 00:11:07,764
But we will never forget.

147
00:11:08,218 --> 00:11:10,960
Just as you will never forget the death

148
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:13,585
that brought you to us all those years ago.

149
00:11:28,402 --> 00:11:31,960
This is to remind you of
your oath and allegiance to us.

150
00:11:33,016 --> 00:11:35,689
The stakes of this mission
are higher than ever.

151
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:38,960
Your habitual rope
behavior will not be tolerated.

152
00:11:39,489 --> 00:11:44,316
Should you choose to accept
it is imperative that you listen.

153
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:46,960
Your government is searching for a key.

154
00:11:47,833 --> 00:11:50,833
Its purpose, its vital importance to us,

155
00:11:51,272 --> 00:11:53,096
is none of your concern.

156
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:58,283
What should concern you is the
involvement of your friend Ilsa Faust.

157
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:02,223
She killed a courier in Istanbul.

158
00:12:02,556 --> 00:12:05,960
and we believe he was carrying
one half of the key we're searching for.

159
00:12:07,679 --> 00:12:10,801
Why she has chosen to
interfere in this affair is a mystery.

160
00:12:11,719 --> 00:12:13,587
as are her whereabouts.

161
00:12:14,606 --> 00:12:19,021
What is certain is that your
government has put a price on her head.

162
00:12:20,372 --> 00:12:23,581
And these bounty
hunters are out to collect it.

163
00:12:24,759 --> 00:12:26,759
They never bring a fugitive back to life.

164
00:12:27,706 --> 00:12:29,706
And rarely in one piece.

165
00:12:30,778 --> 00:12:32,960
We believe they're headed for
the Arabian desert's empty quarter

166
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:34,960
in search of your friend.

167
00:12:35,458 --> 00:12:39,395
Find the bounty hunters
and you may just find her.

168
00:12:40,362 --> 00:12:42,960
Your mission should you choose to accept it

169
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:46,402
is to acquire the key and deliver it to us.

170
00:12:46,895 --> 00:12:49,960
What happens to Ilsa
after that is up to you.

171
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:54,960
As always if any members of
your team are caught or killed

172
00:12:55,264 --> 00:12:57,960
the secretary will disavow
any knowledge of your actions.

173
00:12:59,571 --> 00:13:03,038
This message will self
destruct in five seconds.

174
00:13:04,086 --> 00:13:05,478
Good luck Ethan.

175
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:31,480
Ethan.

176
00:15:00,873 --> 00:15:02,313
Step up.

177
00:17:13,838 --> 00:17:15,535
So what are we dealing with?

178
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:21,611
This entity has multiple personalities
at times behaving like a computer virus

179
00:17:21,636 --> 00:17:23,926
and a tapeworm and a botnet.

180
00:17:23,951 --> 00:17:27,572
Distorting any and all digital
information with which it comes in contact.

181
00:17:27,586 --> 00:17:33,159
Once infected nothing recorded, stored or
transmitted digitally can be trusted as fact.

182
00:17:33,184 --> 00:17:37,070
At the outset it concentrated
primarily on news and social media

183
00:17:37,095 --> 00:17:39,960
which was of little concern to
us as it often suited our purposes

184
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:42,539
until six months ago,
when the entity breached

185
00:17:42,564 --> 00:17:44,960
Saudi Arabia's General
Intelligence directorate.

186
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:48,419
And assimilated their top
secret active-learning AI

187
00:17:48,444 --> 00:17:50,632
before vanishing into the cloud.

188
00:17:50,657 --> 00:17:53,960
Subsequent attacks increased
10,000 fold overnight,

189
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:55,609
spreading exponentially.

190
00:17:55,634 --> 00:18:01,234
Indicating that the entity
has since become sentient.

191
00:18:01,259 --> 00:18:03,379
You're telling me this
thing has a mind of its own?

192
00:18:03,413 --> 00:18:06,145
Over the last three weeks
alone it has accessed

193
00:18:06,170 --> 00:18:09,031
our satellite telecommunications,
the Federal Reserve,

194
00:18:09,056 --> 00:18:11,516
the stock market and
the national power grid.

195
00:18:11,541 --> 00:18:14,843
The FAA, NASA and the
combined branches of our military.

196
00:18:14,868 --> 00:18:16,067
And we're not alone.

197
00:18:16,092 --> 00:18:19,960
It has penetrated the world
and European central banks.

198
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:22,960
It has led you to the major defense,
finance and infrastructure systems

199
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:27,293
of Russia, India, Israel,
Australia, all of Europe.

200
00:18:27,487 --> 00:18:30,193
And what did it do to all
of these systems exactly?

201
00:18:30,547 --> 00:18:31,656
Nothing.

202
00:18:32,503 --> 00:18:33,190
Nothing?

203
00:18:33,290 --> 00:18:34,960
It came and it went.

204
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:38,658
Leaving fingerprints where
they could easily be found

205
00:18:38,683 --> 00:18:41,030
and sending a very clear message.

206
00:18:42,473 --> 00:18:43,793
I shall return.

207
00:18:44,107 --> 00:18:47,960
Whatever its ultimate goal
is, we're powerless to stop it.

208
00:18:48,113 --> 00:18:51,907
The full force of its energy is
now directed at a single objective.

209
00:18:51,932 --> 00:18:53,764
The world's intelligence networks.

210
00:18:53,789 --> 00:18:56,091
The very truth as we know it.

211
00:18:56,231 --> 00:19:00,092
The entire intelligence
community is racing to archive

212
00:19:00,117 --> 00:19:03,119
hard copies of our fact
positive knowledge bases

213
00:19:03,144 --> 00:19:07,126
before our most secure data
centers are breached and corrupted.

214
00:19:07,151 --> 00:19:09,032
Which is only a matter of time.

215
00:19:09,057 --> 00:19:12,764
The entity will know precisely
how to undermine our every strength

216
00:19:12,789 --> 00:19:14,871
and exploit our every weakness.

217
00:19:14,896 --> 00:19:17,814
How to turn our allies into enemies.

218
00:19:17,839 --> 00:19:20,834
And our enemies into aggressors.

219
00:19:20,859 --> 00:19:23,694
Why not air gap our intelligence services?

220
00:19:23,719 --> 00:19:25,960
Cut them off from the
outside world entirely.

221
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:27,428
We already have.

222
00:19:27,453 --> 00:19:30,935
But servers require
humans to maintain them.

223
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:33,960
And humans are the weakest
link in any security chain

224
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:38,040
especially when dealing with a
godless, stateless, amoral enemy.

225
00:19:38,065 --> 00:19:41,960
One that has been patiently
listening, reading, watching.

226
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:45,293
Harvesting our deepest
personal secrets for years.

227
00:19:45,318 --> 00:19:50,102
Able to be guile, blackmail,
bribe, or be anyone at once.

228
00:19:50,588 --> 00:19:54,050
And to manipulate us at will
through our total dependence

229
00:19:54,075 --> 00:19:57,394
on a carefully constructed digital reality.

230
00:19:57,419 --> 00:19:59,506
An enemy that is everywhere.

231
00:20:00,633 --> 00:20:01,960
And nowhere.

232
00:20:02,559 --> 00:20:03,960
And has no center.

233
00:20:08,203 --> 00:20:09,077
Arr.

234
00:20:09,917 --> 00:20:11,525
So what you're telling me is

235
00:20:11,550 --> 00:20:16,239
the most awesome god damn intelligence
and tactical apparatus on the planet

236
00:20:16,264 --> 00:20:19,204
has no way of killing this thing.

237
00:20:19,877 --> 00:20:21,177
You don't want to kill it, sir.

238
00:20:23,622 --> 00:20:25,020
You want to control.

239
00:20:25,367 --> 00:20:26,667
And how do we do that?

240
00:20:26,692 --> 00:20:27,440
Mr. Kittridge.

241
00:20:28,994 --> 00:20:32,309
CIA's assets in the Kremlin
informed us that the Russians

242
00:20:32,334 --> 00:20:36,304
have focused the majority
of their intelligence activity

243
00:20:36,329 --> 00:20:39,691
on acquiring two halves
of the cruciform key.

244
00:20:40,649 --> 00:20:41,972
And what does it unlock?

245
00:20:41,997 --> 00:20:43,105
I'm not exactly sure.

246
00:20:43,971 --> 00:20:46,985
But the Russians seem to believe
that it somehow has the power

247
00:20:47,010 --> 00:20:49,025
to deactivate our mysterious entity.

248
00:20:49,585 --> 00:20:51,285
Though, ideally.

249
00:20:52,312 --> 00:20:53,992
They hope to control it.

250
00:20:54,405 --> 00:20:55,219
Harness.

251
00:20:55,244 --> 00:20:57,485
Do you believe that, Kittridge?

252
00:20:58,378 --> 00:21:02,364
What matters is that the rest of world believes it.

253
00:21:02,739 --> 00:21:06,960
Japan, India, Germany,
and the Brits didn't get no one not

254
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:12,232
not even closest allies have willingly
whispered one word of it to us,

255
00:21:12,392 --> 00:21:17,719
which would indicate that there's a global
race on to acquire the two halves of this key.

256
00:21:17,792 --> 00:21:20,052
Every nation in it before themselves,

257
00:21:20,077 --> 00:21:23,346
not to kill this thing, sir,

258
00:21:23,781 --> 00:21:27,935
but to weaponize it and in so doing establish a new,

259
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:30,932
incontestable form of global dominance.

260
00:21:31,212 --> 00:21:32,960
How do we find this key first?

261
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:35,960
Well, we know that a
buyer is passing somewhere

262
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:39,119
through the Middle East
sometime in the next 72 hours.

263
00:21:39,612 --> 00:21:42,872
We believe that he already
has one half of this key.

264
00:21:42,897 --> 00:21:43,960
You believe?

265
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:46,458
Well, at this point, we can't
be certain it's not a counterfeit.

266
00:21:46,483 --> 00:21:47,583
How would you verify that?

267
00:21:47,608 --> 00:21:50,960
The only thing that can authenticate
one genuine half of the key

268
00:21:50,985 --> 00:21:53,044
is the other genuine half of the key.

269
00:21:53,069 --> 00:21:54,756
It's true mate, if you will.

270
00:21:54,781 --> 00:21:56,996
We think it's some sort of fail-safe.

271
00:21:57,136 --> 00:21:58,523
How do we find its main?

272
00:21:58,548 --> 00:22:01,776
Well, we believe the other
genuine half of the key

273
00:22:01,801 --> 00:22:03,616
was in the hands of this woman.

274
00:22:04,356 --> 00:22:05,231
Who is she?

275
00:22:05,256 --> 00:22:08,395
Ilse Faust, former British intelligence.

276
00:22:08,420 --> 00:22:09,420
Where is she now?

277
00:22:09,445 --> 00:22:10,457
She's dead, sir.

278
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:15,265
She was -excuse me- killed by mercenaries

279
00:22:15,290 --> 00:22:17,960
- looking to collect a bounty.
- and who put up the bounty?

280
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:20,587
Given her body of work,
could it have been anyone?

281
00:22:20,612 --> 00:22:23,209
So any one could have her half of the key?

282
00:22:23,234 --> 00:22:25,064
Not just anyone.

283
00:22:26,298 --> 00:22:28,346
I sent a man to find her.

284
00:22:28,371 --> 00:22:31,486
The only man that she would have entrusted
with her half of the key.

285
00:22:31,511 --> 00:22:32,960
Oh, does he have it, Kittredge?

286
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:34,960
Well, at present, I don't know that, sir.

287
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:37,211
He's refused to come in.

288
00:22:37,898 --> 00:22:38,960
Refused?

289
00:22:40,319 --> 00:22:41,583
Who the hell is this guy?

290
00:22:41,716 --> 00:22:42,604
That's classified.

291
00:22:42,629 --> 00:22:45,316
I'm the goddamn director
of natural intelligence.

292
00:22:46,228 --> 00:22:48,576
What exactly is it I'm not
supposed to know about?

293
00:22:48,601 --> 00:22:50,763
- The IMF, Mr. Kittredge
- the World Bank.

294
00:22:50,788 --> 00:22:52,714
No, that's the International Monetary Fund.

295
00:22:52,739 --> 00:22:53,374
Mr. Kittredge?

296
00:22:53,399 --> 00:22:54,935
I mean the other IMF hours.

297
00:22:56,021 --> 00:22:58,081
What does it stand for?

298
00:22:58,528 --> 00:23:00,641
Impossible mission force.

299
00:23:01,446 --> 00:23:02,446
You're not serious.

300
00:23:02,795 --> 00:23:04,146
I'm afraid he is.

301
00:23:04,553 --> 00:23:08,108
- And what do they do exactly?
- It's just as the name implies.

302
00:23:08,133 --> 00:23:09,494
Whatever the rest of us can't.

303
00:23:09,519 --> 00:23:12,674
- And who's in charge?
- They're not ones to take orders in the traditional sense.

304
00:23:12,699 --> 00:23:14,213
We more or less...

305
00:23:16,933 --> 00:23:18,340
Leave word.

306
00:23:19,059 --> 00:23:21,286
Leave word.

307
00:23:21,293 --> 00:23:21,936
Mr. Kittredge.

308
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:24,154
The IMF operates outside the community

309
00:23:24,179 --> 00:23:26,173
and answers directly to the present.

310
00:23:26,266 --> 00:23:27,895
So let me get this straight.

311
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:31,020
When there's a mission,
none of you can handle.

312
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:35,960
You just leave word for a nameless man

313
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:38,270
and hope he gets the job done.

314
00:23:39,050 --> 00:23:40,065
Is that it?

315
00:23:40,090 --> 00:23:42,960
Should we choose to accept it?

316
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:44,285
What the hell kind of outfit ..

317
00:23:44,310 --> 00:23:46,133
it's to choose what orders to accept.

318
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:51,448
The IMF was expressed and created to ensure
that with no unintended consequences,

319
00:23:52,020 --> 00:23:55,040
that they cannot ensure the
mission's ultimate outcome.

320
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:57,290
They're authorized to decline.

321
00:24:48,886 --> 00:24:50,427
I understand.

322
00:24:51,474 --> 00:24:52,270
You're upset.

323
00:24:53,201 --> 00:24:54,667
I'm not upset, Kittredge.

324
00:24:56,326 --> 00:24:57,943
You want to be to listen.

325
00:25:00,291 --> 00:25:01,516
This is me listening.

326
00:25:03,629 --> 00:25:04,376
All right.

327
00:25:05,434 --> 00:25:07,200
I put the bounty on Bilse's head.

328
00:25:07,225 --> 00:25:09,494
I also told you how to find her.

329
00:25:10,234 --> 00:25:14,326
And I didn't ask her to steal the key.
She did that for reasons of her own.

330
00:25:14,351 --> 00:25:19,560
But that's the pattern, isn't it?

331
00:25:20,295 --> 00:25:24,729
You get her out of trouble
and she always found her way back in.

332
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:36,589
Wait!

333
00:25:38,469 --> 00:25:39,593
It's me!

334
00:25:40,173 --> 00:25:41,293
It's me.

335
00:25:48,193 --> 00:25:49,626
Okay.

336
00:26:22,297 --> 00:26:25,770
Listen to me, You're dead!
You stay dead!

337
00:26:26,133 --> 00:26:27,597
Keep away!

338
00:26:32,037 --> 00:26:34,437
I'm not gonna apologize to you, Hant.

339
00:26:34,462 --> 00:26:36,410
It's my job to use you.

340
00:26:36,828 --> 00:26:39,197
Just like it's your job to be of use.

341
00:26:39,468 --> 00:26:42,490
Did you accomplish your mission or not?

342
00:26:47,728 --> 00:26:49,955
Wherever the other half of this is,

343
00:26:50,569 --> 00:26:53,062
whatever the completed key unlocks,

344
00:26:53,741 --> 00:26:55,448
I will find it.

345
00:26:56,701 --> 00:26:58,248
And then what?

346
00:26:58,688 --> 00:27:02,528
No one should be trusted
with control of the entity.

347
00:27:03,369 --> 00:27:06,316
- I mean to kill it.
- Ethen.

348
00:27:06,341 --> 00:27:09,729
The next world war isn't going to be a
cold one, it's going to be a shooting war,

349
00:27:09,754 --> 00:27:13,729
it's going to be a ballistic war
over a rapidly shrinking ecosystem,

350
00:27:13,754 --> 00:27:16,542
it's going to be a war for the
last of our dwindling energy,

351
00:27:16,567 --> 00:27:18,716
drinkable water, breathable air.

352
00:27:19,356 --> 00:27:23,266
Whoever controls the
entity controls the truth.

353
00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:26,879
The concepts of right and wrong

354
00:27:26,904 --> 00:27:30,960
can be clearly defined for
everyone for centuries to come.

355
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:33,066
Do you even hear yourself?

356
00:27:33,726 --> 00:27:38,080
The days of fighting for
the so-called greater good

357
00:27:39,133 --> 00:27:40,299
are over.

358
00:27:41,073 --> 00:27:42,666
You need to pick a side.

359
00:27:44,046 --> 00:27:46,086
We're on the same side as always, man.

360
00:27:48,406 --> 00:27:49,646
Stay out of my way.

361
00:27:50,613 --> 00:27:51,760
I can't do that.

362
00:27:53,493 --> 00:27:54,909
We're going to be coming after you.

363
00:27:54,934 --> 00:27:57,163
the world is going to be coming after you.

364
00:27:57,349 --> 00:28:00,960
and one way or another,
this mission of yours

365
00:28:01,483 --> 00:28:05,292
is going to cost you dearly.

366
00:28:14,376 --> 00:28:17,109
if I don't get that, we're going
to have company real soon.

367
00:28:34,210 --> 00:28:35,017
Hello?

368
00:28:35,229 --> 00:28:36,430
Director Denlinger, please.

369
00:28:37,970 --> 00:28:41,743
Director is unavailable at the
moment, How can I help you?

370
00:28:42,216 --> 00:28:44,323
CIA Director Eugene Kittrich.

371
00:28:44,476 --> 00:28:45,223
Designator?

372
00:28:45,434 --> 00:28:47,303
Base note, lower case, all one word.

373
00:28:47,328 --> 00:28:49,063
Sir, we have a situation.

374
00:28:49,506 --> 00:28:50,626
No kidding.

375
00:28:50,651 --> 00:28:54,654
Your adjutant was found unconscious
in his home ten minutes ago.

376
00:28:54,679 --> 00:28:56,041
It appears he was drunk.

377
00:28:56,066 --> 00:28:57,604
I understand.

378
00:28:57,629 --> 00:28:58,978
I don't think you do, sir.

379
00:28:59,003 --> 00:29:02,484
Security has been entering
this facility fifteen minutes ago.

380
00:29:02,509 --> 00:29:04,056
I understand. Thank you.

381
00:29:04,143 --> 00:29:06,248
Are you able to speak freely?

382
00:29:06,580 --> 00:29:08,008
No, thank you.

383
00:29:08,033 --> 00:29:09,553
The security team is on their way.

384
00:29:09,578 --> 00:29:12,960
If you're in any danger, simply hang
up the phone before I count to five.

385
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:13,890
One.

386
00:29:18,224 --> 00:29:21,167
Sir, just how do you plan
on getting out of here?

387
00:29:27,020 --> 00:29:28,340
Of course.

388
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:52,960
What's going on?

389
00:30:37,950 --> 00:30:40,945
Listen up. An American
operative with a grievance

390
00:30:40,970 --> 00:30:44,118
against his country is
missing and has malfunctioned.

391
00:30:44,530 --> 00:30:47,418
His agenda representsa
threat to our national interest,

392
00:30:47,443 --> 00:30:50,003
and he must be neutralized at all costs.

393
00:30:50,303 --> 00:30:53,529
Anything of this man's
possession is of vital importance.

394
00:30:53,554 --> 00:30:55,516
It must be captured intact.

395
00:30:55,849 --> 00:30:58,336
The man himself is expendable.

396
00:30:58,396 --> 00:31:00,389
He is not to be underestimated.

397
00:31:00,636 --> 00:31:05,362
A master of infiltration, deception,
sabotage, and psych warfare.

398
00:31:05,387 --> 00:31:08,102
For all intents and purposes,
ladies and gentlemen,

399
00:31:08,127 --> 00:31:10,933
a migrating shapeshifting
incarnation of chaos.

400
00:31:11,108 --> 00:31:17,210
So, for your safety and the safety of those
around you, do not consider him secure

401
00:31:17,235 --> 00:31:21,250
unless you have driven a wooden
stake through his open arms.

402
00:31:21,824 --> 00:31:23,750
This is not a drill.

403
00:31:25,386 --> 00:31:26,573
Self-aware,

404
00:31:27,133 --> 00:31:28,253
self-learning,

405
00:31:28,769 --> 00:31:31,320
truth-eating digital parasite,

406
00:31:32,373 --> 00:31:34,173
infesting all of cyberspace.

407
00:31:36,236 --> 00:31:37,996
Well, it was bound to
happen sooner or later.

408
00:31:38,216 --> 00:31:39,990
and the two halves of this key

409
00:31:39,990 --> 00:31:43,430
just might provide the means of
 controlling this ...

410
00:31:43,430 --> 00:31:44,163
entity.

411
00:31:44,334 --> 00:31:48,233
Meaning every government on the
planet would kill us just to get that key.

412
00:31:48,867 --> 00:31:50,680
- Including our own.
- Exactly.

413
00:31:50,793 --> 00:31:55,433
Putting us on an unsanctioned mission which
has gone rogue before it even started.

414
00:31:55,458 --> 00:32:00,530
Meaning this very conversation
is technically an act of treason.

415
00:32:00,590 --> 00:32:04,070
Or as we like to call it, Monday.

416
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:07,069
So what's the play?

417
00:32:07,094 --> 00:32:11,318
A buyer is coming in on Flight 746
from Amsterdam for a 30-minute layover,

418
00:32:11,343 --> 00:32:14,911
at which time he is hoping to
purchase that half of the key.

419
00:32:14,936 --> 00:32:17,208
And it stands to reason
the buyer will have the

420
00:32:17,233 --> 00:32:19,222
other half of the key
somewhere on that person.

421
00:32:19,362 --> 00:32:22,282
Being the only way to
authenticate our half.

422
00:32:22,588 --> 00:32:24,528
So how do we identify the buyer?

423
00:32:24,602 --> 00:32:28,230
This Geiger counter will detect the radiological
signature of the dragon's egg

424
00:32:28,255 --> 00:32:29,595
invented in the buyer's key.

425
00:32:29,620 --> 00:32:32,148
The augmented reality overly
in these glasses ...

426
00:32:32,641 --> 00:32:33,862
will lead us to it.

427
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:37,360
Oh, that's very clever.

428
00:32:37,775 --> 00:32:40,075
So, do you ID the buyer?

429
00:32:40,175 --> 00:32:41,789
Pick his pockets of your ankle?

430
00:32:41,814 --> 00:32:42,282
Now.

431
00:32:42,373 --> 00:32:43,089
Now?

432
00:32:43,506 --> 00:32:44,309
Because of

433
00:32:44,334 --> 00:32:47,662
The complete key is of no value
if we don't know where it unlocks.

434
00:32:47,749 --> 00:32:50,849
So, you're going to sell the
buyer a whole half of the key?

435
00:32:50,896 --> 00:32:55,576
while we figure out the buyer's connecting
flight and book a USC on that plane.

436
00:32:55,601 --> 00:32:58,621
So you can follow the key wherever it goes.

437
00:32:58,660 --> 00:33:01,914
which you hope is into the hands of
someone who knows what it unlocks.

438
00:33:01,961 --> 00:33:02,787
Precisely.

439
00:33:03,107 --> 00:33:04,967
Finding the complete key.

440
00:33:06,220 --> 00:33:07,357
Tell me the beginning.

441
00:33:07,382 --> 00:33:12,248
The fate of the world depends
on finding whatever it unlocks.

442
00:33:15,940 --> 00:33:16,660
The sky!

443
00:33:16,660 --> 00:33:17,660
No!

444
00:33:19,286 --> 00:33:20,660
Not personally!

445
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:22,660
But it is personally!

446
00:34:00,834 --> 00:34:02,307
- Hey, what's that?
- Alarm

447
00:34:02,332 --> 00:34:05,460
Security alert, suspicious bag on its way to Venice.

448
00:34:05,834 --> 00:34:08,360
Nope it's gone, it must have been
 a false alarm.

449
00:34:16,259 --> 00:34:18,513
Overwatch snapshot.
Where's he at?

450
00:34:22,599 --> 00:34:23,306
Snapshot.

451
00:34:23,331 --> 00:34:24,331
Overwatch I have him.

452
00:34:24,561 --> 00:34:26,561
Terminal B gave 15 at its stop.

453
00:34:29,328 --> 00:34:30,328
I am so?

454
00:34:30,328 --> 00:34:31,328
You are not.

455
00:34:31,328 --> 00:34:35,328
Ethan, would you care to explain
to our friend the Net Ranger?

456
00:34:35,328 --> 00:34:37,572
How I am just as capable
of writing code as he is.

457
00:34:37,597 --> 00:34:38,328
No comment.

458
00:34:38,328 --> 00:34:40,297
Oh, what you figured at
Phineas Freak here is going

459
00:34:40,309 --> 00:34:42,328
to single-handedly work
out a way to kill the entity.

460
00:34:42,328 --> 00:34:44,328
Will I just hold this
in the sulk ring I am?

461
00:34:44,328 --> 00:34:45,328
Probably.

462
00:34:45,328 --> 00:34:46,328
Definitely.

463
00:34:49,698 --> 00:34:51,838
- Tell me where he is.
- Where he is?

464
00:34:51,863 --> 00:34:53,858
Blue suit, right in front of you.

465
00:35:05,172 --> 00:35:06,172
What the fuck are you doing?

466
00:35:06,172 --> 00:35:07,172
What are you doing here?

467
00:35:07,172 --> 00:35:08,111
You're fucking crazy.

468
00:35:08,136 --> 00:35:09,172
What are you doing here?

469
00:35:09,172 --> 00:35:10,172
You're crazy.

470
00:35:10,172 --> 00:35:10,944
Are you crazy?

471
00:35:13,172 --> 00:35:14,172
What are you doing here?

472
00:35:14,172 --> 00:35:15,172
You're fucking crazy.

473
00:35:15,172 --> 00:35:16,172
You're fucking crazy.

474
00:35:19,172 --> 00:35:20,172
Fuck!

475
00:35:20,172 --> 00:35:21,172
It's not him.

476
00:35:21,172 --> 00:35:22,172
It's him.

477
00:35:22,172 --> 00:35:23,172
I'm telling you, it's not him.

478
00:35:23,172 --> 00:35:26,172
And I'm telling you, facial
comes back with a perfect fit.

479
00:35:30,172 --> 00:35:32,172
How did you do that?

480
00:35:32,172 --> 00:35:34,172
No one is safe from Phineas Freak.

481
00:35:42,685 --> 00:35:43,685
Hey, God.

482
00:35:43,685 --> 00:35:44,685
Where is he?

483
00:35:44,685 --> 00:35:45,998
Terminal E gave five.

484
00:35:46,023 --> 00:35:48,685
God damn it, that's clear on
the other side of the airport.

485
00:35:48,685 --> 00:35:49,685
What the fuck was that?

486
00:35:52,028 --> 00:35:57,028
If in their head to Terminal E,
that side of the airport is all yours.

487
00:35:57,374 --> 00:35:59,226
Thank you, Luther.
I see the buyer.

488
00:35:59,251 --> 00:35:59,900
Got him.

489
00:35:59,925 --> 00:36:02,925
The buyer is Otto von Bork, Swiss National.

490
00:36:02,925 --> 00:36:07,206
He's connecting to Venice, departing
in 30 minutes from flight 1031.

491
00:36:07,231 --> 00:36:10,900
- Benji, give me on that flight to Venice.
- Yep, flight 1031 to Venice.

492
00:36:10,925 --> 00:36:11,815
Stand by.

493
00:36:22,628 --> 00:36:23,628
What?

494
00:36:24,442 --> 00:36:27,106
- Ethan, what just happened?
- He was bomped.

495
00:36:27,130 --> 00:36:28,704
Bomped?!
What do you mean, bomped.?

496
00:36:29,107 --> 00:36:31,377
The woman picked his pocket.
Tag her.

497
00:36:31,402 --> 00:36:32,424
Tell me who she is.

498
00:36:32,449 --> 00:36:33,808
1031 Venice.

499
00:36:41,402 --> 00:36:42,762
Luther, meet our comms.

500
00:36:43,402 --> 00:36:45,851
- What is it?
- That bag was on its way to flight 1031.

501
00:36:45,876 --> 00:36:46,574
What bag?

502
00:36:46,735 --> 00:36:48,622
It was a suspicious bag in there.

503
00:36:48,662 --> 00:36:50,468
- A few minutes ago.
- So what about it?

504
00:36:50,493 --> 00:36:53,382
It was on its way to flight 1031 to Venice.

505
00:36:53,407 --> 00:36:54,575
It's the buyer's plane.

506
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:55,662
It's Ethan's plane.

507
00:36:56,275 --> 00:36:57,869
Luther, do you copy?
Who is she?

508
00:36:58,209 --> 00:36:59,375
Well, it wasn't a false alarm.

509
00:36:59,429 --> 00:37:02,032
What if somebody is trying to
smuggle a bomb onto that plane?

510
00:37:02,057 --> 00:37:04,465
And what if that's what
the entity wants us to think?

511
00:37:04,545 --> 00:37:05,779
To keep even off that plane?

512
00:37:05,804 --> 00:37:08,012
- Luther, what's happening?
- Should we bomb it?

513
00:37:08,319 --> 00:37:10,570
- No.
- Guys, guys, you hear me?

514
00:37:10,595 --> 00:37:13,537
Find that bag.
I'll direct you. Go.

515
00:37:13,562 --> 00:37:15,792
Luther, tell me, is there something wrong?

516
00:37:15,817 --> 00:37:17,205
Nothing to worry about.

517
00:37:17,491 --> 00:37:18,491
It's under control.

518
00:37:19,350 --> 00:37:20,144
Gather.

519
00:37:20,169 --> 00:37:22,503
Info on the woman is coming now.

520
00:37:24,877 --> 00:37:29,852
Oh, whoever she is, she's no spy.

521
00:37:29,877 --> 00:37:31,190
She's a thief.

522
00:37:31,990 --> 00:37:33,345
Where are we going, Luther?

523
00:37:33,370 --> 00:37:35,617
Benji, there's a door
on your immediate left.

524
00:37:36,218 --> 00:37:37,451
I'm unlocking it now.

525
00:37:41,583 --> 00:37:44,587
The bag you're after is on tray 01833.

526
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:47,487
Heading towards the
northwest corner of the facility.

527
00:37:47,664 --> 00:37:48,664
Copy that.

528
00:37:59,876 --> 00:38:00,617
Hi.

529
00:38:03,218 --> 00:38:04,218
Hello.

530
00:38:08,218 --> 00:38:09,218
Oh, I get it.

531
00:38:10,530 --> 00:38:12,530
You thought I was someone else.

532
00:38:14,630 --> 00:38:15,630
I'm most interested.

533
00:38:17,218 --> 00:38:18,438
Give me a chance.

534
00:38:19,344 --> 00:38:20,418
I'll scream.

535
00:38:22,311 --> 00:38:23,311
Please do.

536
00:38:26,684 --> 00:38:27,684
What do you want?

537
00:38:29,151 --> 00:38:30,184
This key.

538
00:38:31,904 --> 00:38:33,904
The one you picked from that man's pocket.

539
00:38:34,617 --> 00:38:35,638
It's worthless ..

540
00:38:36,178 --> 00:38:37,538
without this key.

541
00:38:39,193 --> 00:38:40,526
But together,

542
00:38:40,526 --> 00:38:45,902
there was four million in cryptocurrency
that man was carrying around a flash drive.

543
00:38:46,689 --> 00:38:48,409
I wouldn't know anything about that.

544
00:38:48,507 --> 00:38:50,195
And why was this driving your pocket?

545
00:38:51,955 --> 00:38:52,955
Who are you?

546
00:38:53,816 --> 00:38:54,816
You working with someone?

547
00:38:55,695 --> 00:38:57,961
Never, I'm strictly single now.

548
00:38:58,598 --> 00:38:59,689
Today you got a partner.

549
00:39:00,346 --> 00:39:02,460
The man you stole this from to complete a transaction

550
00:39:02,485 --> 00:39:04,514
will lead this airport with both of these

551
00:39:04,588 --> 00:39:07,548
without ever knowing his pocket was picked up
before your board's flight in ..

552
00:39:07,615 --> 00:39:08,655
Seven minutes

553
00:39:08,985 --> 00:39:10,140
Seven minutes.

554
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:12,880
You both know you're a good pickpocket.

555
00:39:13,585 --> 00:39:15,585
Let's see what kind of pickpocket you are.

556
00:39:17,214 --> 00:39:19,536
You expect me to push it back.

557
00:39:20,346 --> 00:39:21,346
Oh, I know you will.

558
00:39:22,092 --> 00:39:23,123
You're a thief.

559
00:39:23,285 --> 00:39:25,716
You want the money
and I can give it to you.

560
00:39:27,085 --> 00:39:28,085
Your choice.

561
00:39:29,346 --> 00:39:30,346
You're in or you're out?

562
00:39:33,190 --> 00:39:34,190
All right.

563
00:39:35,095 --> 00:39:36,095
So what's the play?

564
00:39:36,349 --> 00:39:38,416
I sure hope you know what you're doing.

565
00:39:38,682 --> 00:39:39,596
After you.

566
00:39:42,135 --> 00:39:44,489
Oh, I won't be needing this.

567
00:39:44,902 --> 00:39:45,955
I don't smoke.

568
00:39:47,336 --> 00:39:48,336
Keep it.

569
00:39:48,875 --> 00:39:50,175
Something you'll remember me by.

570
00:39:55,704 --> 00:39:59,704
Ethan, the alloy in that key she
took off the buyer doesn't match.

571
00:40:00,116 --> 00:40:02,450
- It's counterfeit.
- I expect nothing less.

572
00:40:02,841 --> 00:40:04,423
That doesn't change your objective.

573
00:40:04,448 --> 00:40:05,968
The buyer has to leave with both keys.

574
00:40:06,022 --> 00:40:07,196
Talk to me later.

575
00:40:07,221 --> 00:40:09,923
- Where am I going?
- Benji, head down the stairs in front of you

576
00:40:09,948 --> 00:40:11,298
and the bag should be right there.

577
00:40:11,323 --> 00:40:12,022
Okay.

578
00:40:12,022 --> 00:40:13,022
Come back, come back.

579
00:40:18,564 --> 00:40:19,564
That's him.

580
00:40:19,564 --> 00:40:20,564
Right in front of you.

581
00:40:22,637 --> 00:40:23,320
Okay, okay

582
00:40:23,344 --> 00:40:24,384
Hey, hey.
Sorry,

583
00:40:24,409 --> 00:40:26,224
Sorry, thought you were somebody else.

584
00:40:27,831 --> 00:40:29,831
Runs jerk in our chain.

585
00:40:30,464 --> 00:40:31,464
Everybody.

586
00:40:31,464 --> 00:40:33,464
Two man teams spread out.

587
00:40:33,464 --> 00:40:36,241
Ethan, our American
friends are getting wise.

588
00:40:36,266 --> 00:40:38,464
They're breaking up and
canvassing the airport.

589
00:40:38,464 --> 00:40:39,515
Keep your eyes peeled.

590
00:40:39,577 --> 00:40:40,861
So what do I call you?

591
00:40:41,437 --> 00:40:42,437
How about Grace?

592
00:40:42,842 --> 00:40:43,842
You?

593
00:40:43,842 --> 00:40:44,842
Listen, Grace.

594
00:40:45,681 --> 00:40:47,681
You should know we're
not the only interested party.

595
00:40:47,706 --> 00:40:49,374
I tell you to run, you run.

596
00:40:49,399 --> 00:40:50,148
 Run?

597
00:40:51,108 --> 00:40:52,461
This is getting exciting.

598
00:40:53,074 --> 00:40:56,014
- Benji, have you got that bag?
- I'll find it, I'll find it.

599
00:41:09,722 --> 00:41:14,113
There's a cylindrical device inside.
I'm going to take it out.

600
00:41:18,017 --> 00:41:19,513
Now we're going through.

601
00:41:19,538 --> 00:41:22,309
Ethan, the buyer is in the
waiting area above you.

602
00:41:22,334 --> 00:41:23,543
Top of the escalator.

603
00:41:25,890 --> 00:41:27,890
All units are headed in your direction.

604
00:41:27,890 --> 00:41:30,890
Your location is going to be
crawling with agents any time now.

605
00:41:40,263 --> 00:41:42,263
Whatever it is, I've just activated it.

606
00:41:44,549 --> 00:41:46,662
Looks like we have five minutes.

607
00:41:49,263 --> 00:41:51,277
- Also, it appears to be nuclear.
- How big?

608
00:41:51,302 --> 00:41:53,540
- Big enough to matter to everybody in this airport

609
00:41:53,662 --> 00:41:54,636
Can you disarm it?

610
00:41:54,656 --> 00:41:56,824
- Well, I haven't got any tools.
- Then find something.

611
00:41:56,849 --> 00:41:58,656
Well, where are we going to find...

612
00:42:22,373 --> 00:42:23,980
Is this where we run?

613
00:42:24,799 --> 00:42:25,799
Not yet.

614
00:42:26,454 --> 00:42:28,454
Benji, how are you doing with that bomb?

615
00:42:28,454 --> 00:42:29,669
Come on, come on, come on.

616
00:42:31,454 --> 00:42:32,454
I got it!

617
00:42:32,454 --> 00:42:36,454
It's a cylinder cypher, there's eight wheels.

618
00:42:36,454 --> 00:42:38,531
Looks like 14 letters on each wheel.

619
00:42:38,556 --> 00:42:41,515
1.5 billion possible combinations.

620
00:42:41,574 --> 00:42:42,574
Give or take.

621
00:42:43,916 --> 00:42:44,949
Oh my God.

622
00:42:45,195 --> 00:42:46,195
What now?

623
00:42:46,956 --> 00:42:48,975
The wheels, they spell out a message.

624
00:42:49,469 --> 00:42:51,018
You are done.

625
00:42:51,043 --> 00:42:52,670
No way!
Not yet, we are.

626
00:42:52,695 --> 00:42:53,695
No, no, no.

627
00:42:53,695 --> 00:42:54,825
They're not D-O-N-E.

628
00:42:54,941 --> 00:42:56,985
D-U-N-N.

629
00:42:57,841 --> 00:42:58,841
It's my last name.

630
00:43:03,481 --> 00:43:04,643
It knows who I am.

631
00:43:17,428 --> 00:43:19,510
Hold on, there's a message on the display.

632
00:43:19,535 --> 00:43:21,484
I speak without a mask.

633
00:43:21,509 --> 00:43:24,428
I fly through the air without wings.
What am I?

634
00:43:24,428 --> 00:43:26,361
- You get me what?
- It's a riddle.

635
00:43:26,381 --> 00:43:28,116
I suspect this thing is voice-activated.

636
00:43:28,141 --> 00:43:29,302
It wants me to say the answer.

637
00:43:29,327 --> 00:43:31,282
I fly through the air.

638
00:43:31,633 --> 00:43:32,467
An echo.

639
00:43:33,141 --> 00:43:35,141
That's it, that's it, that's it, that's it.

640
00:43:35,141 --> 00:43:36,203
Okay, a new message.

641
00:43:36,427 --> 00:43:38,663
Are you afraid of death?

642
00:43:39,329 --> 00:43:41,483
- What kind of a riddle is that?
- It's not a riddle.

643
00:43:41,508 --> 00:43:43,329
It's a psychometric test.

644
00:43:43,829 --> 00:43:45,829
The more questions you answer,

645
00:43:45,829 --> 00:43:47,829
the more I don't know about you.

646
00:43:48,009 --> 00:43:49,071
Are you afraid of death?

647
00:43:49,096 --> 00:43:50,003
No.

648
00:43:51,150 --> 00:43:52,150
Did it work?

649
00:43:52,150 --> 00:43:53,150
I lied.

650
00:43:53,150 --> 00:43:55,342
- It knows.
- Just tell it the truth.

651
00:43:55,509 --> 00:43:56,256
Say it.

652
00:43:56,329 --> 00:43:57,519
Are you afraid of death?

653
00:43:57,544 --> 00:43:59,150
Yes, who isn't?

654
00:44:09,150 --> 00:44:11,841
Okay, what's always
approaching but never arrives?

655
00:44:12,150 --> 00:44:12,627
Um...

656
00:44:12,652 --> 00:44:14,194
Wait, wait, wait.
I know this one.

657
00:44:14,214 --> 00:44:15,336
The clock is ticking, Luther.

658
00:44:15,361 --> 00:44:16,609
Riddle's on my thing, Benji.

659
00:44:16,634 --> 00:44:19,214
- What more can I say?
- We're running out of time!

660
00:44:20,194 --> 00:44:21,274
There he is.

661
00:44:21,714 --> 00:44:25,059
- This is too easy.
- Sorry to bother you, Ethan.

662
00:44:25,084 --> 00:44:27,714
What should happen to know
what's always approaching...

663
00:44:27,714 --> 00:44:29,832
but never arrives?

664
00:44:29,857 --> 00:44:32,257
What's always approaching
but never arrives?

665
00:44:32,310 --> 00:44:33,714
Tomorrow.

666
00:44:34,551 --> 00:44:35,343
What?

667
00:44:35,368 --> 00:44:37,290
Always approaching but never arrives.

668
00:44:37,315 --> 00:44:38,103
Tomorrow.

669
00:44:38,744 --> 00:44:39,583
It's tomorrow.

670
00:44:39,608 --> 00:44:41,650
- Tomorrow.
- Tomorrow, tomorrow, tomorrow.

671
00:44:42,437 --> 00:44:45,190
- Okay, next question...
- Do you want the goods?

672
00:44:45,437 --> 00:44:46,437
I'll be watching.

673
00:44:46,437 --> 00:44:48,048
Why, you don't trust me?

674
00:44:53,775 --> 00:44:55,195
Luther, what is happening?

675
00:44:55,220 --> 00:44:58,501
Nothing to worry about.
Everything is under control.

676
00:44:58,526 --> 00:44:59,437
Okay, next question...

677
00:44:59,437 --> 00:45:02,946
Who or what is the most
important thing to you?

678
00:45:03,437 --> 00:45:04,992
- Say it.
- I can...

679
00:45:05,017 --> 00:45:06,439
There's no other choice, say it.

680
00:45:07,070 --> 00:45:08,070
My friends.

681
00:45:09,630 --> 00:45:10,630
Bastard.

682
00:45:22,066 --> 00:45:24,066
- Is he here?
- Yes, he is.

683
00:45:24,066 --> 00:45:25,565
Give me the money, give me the key.

684
00:45:27,066 --> 00:45:27,832
Okay, okay.

685
00:45:27,857 --> 00:45:30,066
What gets bigger, the more you take away?

686
00:45:30,066 --> 00:45:31,066
A hole.

687
00:45:31,066 --> 00:45:32,638
A hole! Brilliant, brilliant!

688
00:45:44,218 --> 00:45:46,204
I've got no more questions
than there's one more wheel.

689
00:45:46,229 --> 00:45:48,427
How am I supposed to give
answers if I've got no questions?

690
00:45:48,452 --> 00:45:51,527
- That must be your final test.
- I've got 45 seconds!

691
00:45:54,838 --> 00:45:55,838
What happens now?

692
00:45:56,365 --> 00:45:57,188
I'm thinking...

693
00:45:57,492 --> 00:45:58,348
Don't move.

694
00:45:58,355 --> 00:46:00,748
There's something down need a way out of here.

695
00:46:01,224 --> 00:46:02,618
We have a bigger problem, Ethan.

696
00:46:02,643 --> 00:46:05,431
- It's very possible no one is getting out of here.
- What?

697
00:46:05,456 --> 00:46:06,991
There's a bomb in Bagga Chandler.

698
00:46:07,342 --> 00:46:08,342
A nuclear bomb.

699
00:46:08,342 --> 00:46:11,034
The question I asked you
is part of the code for disarmament.

700
00:46:11,059 --> 00:46:12,568
Stop, stop, stop, stop.

701
00:46:14,688 --> 00:46:17,121
- Why didn't you tell me this?
- Wait, you had a lot going on.

702
00:46:17,135 --> 00:46:18,566
We didn't want to bother you.
Listen to me.

703
00:46:18,572 --> 00:46:21,787
A nuclear bomb is something
you bother me with immediately.

704
00:46:21,812 --> 00:46:23,572
- How much time?
- 20 seconds.

705
00:46:24,572 --> 00:46:25,990
- 20 seconds?
- Wait, there's one more riddle.

706
00:46:26,015 --> 00:46:26,763
I'm working on it.

707
00:46:26,788 --> 00:46:27,743
15 seconds.

708
00:46:27,743 --> 00:46:28,743
Easy, easy.

709
00:46:29,244 --> 00:46:31,894
- What's the riddle?
- In the time it takes me to explain, we're all going to be dead.

710
00:46:31,919 --> 00:46:34,540
- Come on, Benji.
- Why do we always end up in these situations?

711
00:46:34,860 --> 00:46:35,430
10 seconds!

712
00:46:36,094 --> 00:46:36,801
nine

713
00:46:37,220 --> 00:46:37,754
eight

714
00:46:38,154 --> 00:46:38,907
seven

715
00:46:39,338 --> 00:46:39,904
six

716
00:46:40,381 --> 00:46:41,177
five

717
00:46:52,452 --> 00:46:53,452
Oh my God.

718
00:46:53,812 --> 00:46:54,812
What is it?

719
00:46:56,452 --> 00:46:57,452
It's empty.

720
00:46:57,452 --> 00:46:58,541
What do you mean empty?

721
00:46:58,718 --> 00:46:59,718
There's nothing inside.

722
00:47:05,968 --> 00:47:06,968
We should have the key.

723
00:47:06,968 --> 00:47:08,167
- Which key?
- Our key.

724
00:47:08,192 --> 00:47:09,194
- The real key.
- What?

725
00:47:09,219 --> 00:47:10,454
Let's just find her.

726
00:47:20,036 --> 00:47:22,036
Again, she's headed for Terminal E.

727
00:47:34,510 --> 00:47:36,535
- Okaybe
- What is it?

728
00:47:36,535 --> 00:47:38,232
- Who's there, Benji?
- Abort Abort! Get out!

729
00:47:38,255 --> 00:47:40,255
- Where do we run, Devu?
- No, we don't.

730
00:47:40,255 --> 00:47:42,194
This mission is terminated.

731
00:47:42,274 --> 00:47:43,694
Get out now.

732
00:47:54,657 --> 00:47:55,483
Hunt!

733
00:47:55,508 --> 00:47:56,508
Stop right there.

734
00:47:56,508 --> 00:47:57,508
Hey!

735
00:47:57,508 --> 00:47:58,508
You see?

736
00:47:58,508 --> 00:47:59,508
You see where?

737
00:47:59,508 --> 00:48:00,508
Excuse me.

738
00:48:00,648 --> 00:48:01,648
Excuse me.

739
00:48:02,025 --> 00:48:02,872
Sorry.

740
00:48:02,959 --> 00:48:03,605
Sorry.

741
00:48:07,839 --> 00:48:08,919
Rome.

742
00:48:41,198 --> 00:48:42,383
Sorry, sorry.

743
00:49:25,234 --> 00:49:27,400
It's gotta be here somewhere.

744
00:49:28,428 --> 00:49:29,947
God damn it!

745
00:49:41,055 --> 00:49:44,212
What we have here is
shortwave radio. Magnetic

746
00:49:44,224 --> 00:49:47,580
audio recording cathode
ray tube monitors.

747
00:49:48,260 --> 00:49:50,055
No more ones and zeros.

748
00:49:50,926 --> 00:49:56,313
It's a fully analog off-line safe room
shielded from our digitally based entity.

749
00:49:58,146 --> 00:49:59,746
Where is this feed coming from?

750
00:50:00,055 --> 00:50:02,766
Corona spy satellite from the Cold War.

751
00:50:03,961 --> 00:50:07,355
- Had no idea we were still using those things.
- Yeah, well we weren't.

752
00:50:07,768 --> 00:50:12,194
Gave them to the National Weather Service 20
years ago as the last one still functioning.

753
00:50:12,401 --> 00:50:16,169
So, will this thing help us
find your nameless IMF man?

754
00:50:16,396 --> 00:50:18,143
Nothing can do that, sir.

755
00:50:18,316 --> 00:50:22,055
But it has allowed us to
keep tabs on this woman.

756
00:50:23,856 --> 00:50:27,055
She was seen with our man
at the airport in Abu Dhabi.

757
00:50:27,802 --> 00:50:29,196
Who is she?

758
00:50:29,949 --> 00:50:31,311
Where is she now?

759
00:50:43,056 --> 00:50:46,793
You are here because Italian
police received an anonymous tip.

760
00:50:46,823 --> 00:50:49,142
That a woman matching
your description,

761
00:50:49,167 --> 00:50:52,529
would be arriving on the afternoon
flight from Abu Dhabi.

762
00:50:52,554 --> 00:50:56,215
This woman had multiple
passports in her position.

763
00:50:56,642 --> 00:50:59,955
This one is wanted for
a fraud in St. Petersburg.

764
00:51:00,868 --> 00:51:04,102
Jewel theft in Antwerp,
art theft in Monaco,

765
00:51:04,248 --> 00:51:07,236
graft them on an
extortion in Mumbai.

766
00:51:07,603 --> 00:51:12,330
But this is my favorite,
resistant arrest in Rio.

767
00:51:14,643 --> 00:51:16,448
Which leads me to wonder,

768
00:51:17,551 --> 00:51:19,685
Which one of these women is you?

769
00:51:20,344 --> 00:51:22,258
I've never seen these before in my life.

770
00:51:22,823 --> 00:51:26,823
They were in your purse and
your picture is in everywhere.

771
00:51:27,244 --> 00:51:28,931
- May I see?
- Please.

772
00:51:34,891 --> 00:51:36,391
Yes, it's an amazing likeness.

773
00:51:36,681 --> 00:51:38,171
But it isn't me.

774
00:51:39,544 --> 00:51:45,137
As I keep telling you, I'm a schoolteacher
from Brighton, on a sabbatical.

775
00:51:45,731 --> 00:51:47,377
Whichever you're involved in,

776
00:51:47,731 --> 00:51:50,867
you've obviously made some
 very powerful enemies.

777
00:52:00,181 --> 00:52:00,741
See.

778
00:52:02,261 --> 00:52:03,101
Okay.

779
00:52:06,688 --> 00:52:07,825
I have lawyer to see her.

780
00:52:08,367 --> 00:52:09,127
My lawyer?

781
00:52:44,946 --> 00:52:46,359
Magistrate Spencer.

782
00:52:47,566 --> 00:52:48,929
Hanselry, who are you?

783
00:52:49,433 --> 00:52:50,462
Interpol.

784
00:52:51,949 --> 00:52:56,131
I've come regarding the arrest
of the woman from Abu Dhabi.

785
00:52:56,709 --> 00:52:59,968
I'll need you to inventory the items
on her purse at the time of her arrest.

786
00:53:00,636 --> 00:53:02,554
May I see some identification, please?

787
00:53:04,002 --> 00:53:04,909
Where's the rest?

788
00:53:05,429 --> 00:53:07,566
I assure you, this is everything.

789
00:53:07,810 --> 00:53:11,146
- What was her name?
- She left Abu Dhabi with a certain key.

790
00:53:11,362 --> 00:53:14,182
- There was no key.
- It was an unusual sort.

791
00:53:15,795 --> 00:53:17,844
One that you could mistake for a pendant.

792
00:53:18,871 --> 00:53:24,159
The kind that would be tempted to
hang on a chain around Amelia's neck.

793
00:53:25,920 --> 00:53:26,953
Amelia.

794
00:53:27,866 --> 00:53:28,819
Your wife.

795
00:53:29,793 --> 00:53:32,493
Mother of your lovely daughter, Serena.

796
00:53:32,926 --> 00:53:34,386
You're not Interpol.

797
00:53:34,799 --> 00:53:36,593
I am, if I wish to be.

798
00:53:37,913 --> 00:53:40,743
I can be anything, and I know everything.

799
00:53:41,509 --> 00:53:44,763
I know this wouldn't be the first time
you've helped yourself to stolen goods.

800
00:53:45,032 --> 00:53:46,256
A Karate bracelet.

801
00:53:46,949 --> 00:53:48,615
It would clear your suspicion,

802
00:53:48,609 --> 00:53:51,322
but we both know you gave it to
 your mistress, Amelia,

803
00:53:51,489 --> 00:53:54,504
on August 21st, her 29th birthday.

804
00:53:55,082 --> 00:53:56,832
Who are you?

805
00:53:58,866 --> 00:54:02,753
I'm going to have to
search you, just to be sure.

806
00:54:06,829 --> 00:54:08,903
Your secretary's not with us.

807
00:54:22,462 --> 00:54:23,982
That is the agent.

808
00:54:26,475 --> 00:54:27,342
Here you go.

809
00:54:28,709 --> 00:54:30,822
- What better hospital for?
- Thank you.

810
00:54:47,592 --> 00:54:48,631
You.

811
00:54:49,371 --> 00:54:50,653
You did this.

812
00:54:50,678 --> 00:54:52,024
I called the police.

813
00:54:52,102 --> 00:54:55,678
I didn't tell them about
your colorful past.

814
00:54:56,751 --> 00:54:57,751
That's on you.

815
00:54:58,865 --> 00:55:02,284
You put pocket back in another
passenger before you were arrested.

816
00:55:02,785 --> 00:55:05,785
You exchanged details and
arranged to meet later on.

817
00:55:05,810 --> 00:55:09,997
Right now, someone out
there hasn't a sleight of mind.

818
00:55:10,717 --> 00:55:12,233
An unwitting courier.

819
00:55:12,523 --> 00:55:14,043
Perfect accomplice.

820
00:55:14,838 --> 00:55:17,453
I'm guessing a man, middle aged

821
00:55:18,280 --> 00:55:22,053
A man, waiting his whole life to be noticed
by a woman like you.

822
00:55:24,193 --> 00:55:25,240
Morphin.

823
00:55:26,627 --> 00:55:29,627
I'm intelligent, inherently resourceful.

824
00:55:30,208 --> 00:55:33,867
Growing up in poverty left
you longing for the finer things,

825
00:55:34,448 --> 00:55:35,941
Other people's things.

826
00:55:36,894 --> 00:55:38,347
Some saw your potential.

827
00:55:38,372 --> 00:55:40,448
And helped you hone your skills.

828
00:55:40,972 --> 00:55:43,531
Skills that gave you the
life you thought you wanted.

829
00:55:43,658 --> 00:55:46,843
Tailored clothes, fine dining, luxury hotels.

830
00:55:47,225 --> 00:55:49,771
Skills that kept you one
step ahead of the law.

831
00:55:51,031 --> 00:55:51,824
Until now.

832
00:55:54,178 --> 00:55:57,064
You can't blame a girl for
trying to make a dishonest living.

833
00:55:58,438 --> 00:56:00,944
You had no idea what you were stealing.

834
00:56:01,278 --> 00:56:03,131
Otherwise you'd never worth stealing it.

835
00:56:04,644 --> 00:56:05,727
Tell you what.

836
00:56:06,004 --> 00:56:07,131
You get me out of here.

837
00:56:07,227 --> 00:56:08,544
And I'll take you straight to the key.

838
00:56:09,299 --> 00:56:10,551
I have a better idea.

839
00:56:10,906 --> 00:56:12,906
You're going to tell me everything.

840
00:56:12,972 --> 00:56:14,837
Then I'll think about
getting you out of here.

841
00:56:14,862 --> 00:56:16,862
I'll start with who hired you.

842
00:56:16,884 --> 00:56:17,990
And don't lie to me.

843
00:56:18,603 --> 00:56:19,650
Because I'll know.

844
00:56:19,970 --> 00:56:21,837
I have no idea who hired me.

845
00:56:21,862 --> 00:56:24,056
Contact with the client was
almost entirely electronic.

846
00:56:24,081 --> 00:56:24,743
Evel.

847
00:56:24,768 --> 00:56:25,290
Texts.

848
00:56:25,315 --> 00:56:25,956
Encrypted.

849
00:56:25,983 --> 00:56:26,656
Actually.

850
00:56:26,681 --> 00:56:27,296
Almost.

851
00:56:27,321 --> 00:56:27,836
...

852
00:56:27,910 --> 00:56:31,118
You said contact with the client
was almost entirely electronic.

853
00:56:31,143 --> 00:56:33,925
There was a dead drop
in a cafe in Luxembourg.

854
00:56:33,950 --> 00:56:35,641
- An envelope.
- What was in the envelope?

855
00:56:36,142 --> 00:56:37,348
A ticket to Abu Dhabi.

856
00:56:38,554 --> 00:56:39,448
And a picture of you.

857
00:56:44,818 --> 00:56:47,010
My instructions were to
follow you at the airport.

858
00:56:47,143 --> 00:56:48,497
You'd be tailing a mark.

859
00:56:48,522 --> 00:56:51,397
You'd have a key and 4
million encrypted currency.

860
00:56:51,697 --> 00:56:53,527
That drive was useless by the way, it's empty.

861
00:56:54,818 --> 00:56:57,760
The only hope I have for getting
paid is to deliver your half of the key.

862
00:56:57,833 --> 00:57:00,141
And you were instructed to deliver it too.

863
00:57:00,420 --> 00:57:01,087
Venice.

864
00:57:01,486 --> 00:57:02,719
Party of the Ducale Palace.

865
00:57:02,766 --> 00:57:03,859
Tomorrow midnight.

866
00:57:07,859 --> 00:57:09,133
You're expecting someone?

867
00:57:09,293 --> 00:57:10,766
My friends from the airport.

868
00:57:11,085 --> 00:57:12,746
Saw them in the hallway a few minutes ago.

869
00:57:15,293 --> 00:57:17,293
You could have said something sooner.

870
00:57:17,293 --> 00:57:19,932
Or they were chasing you, not me.

871
00:57:43,044 --> 00:57:44,044
Pervert!

872
00:57:45,853 --> 00:57:47,243
No, Grace, Grace.

873
00:57:49,499 --> 00:57:50,339
No, no, no.

874
00:57:50,364 --> 00:57:51,804
This is my client.

875
00:57:53,426 --> 00:57:54,166
Grace.

876
00:57:55,125 --> 00:57:55,926
Grace.

877
00:58:01,403 --> 00:58:02,403
No,no..

878
00:58:04,109 --> 00:58:05,293
Thank you.

879
00:58:05,293 --> 00:58:06,182
Thank you.

880
00:58:35,138 --> 00:58:37,384
No.

881
00:58:40,891 --> 00:58:41,891
I'm sorry.

882
00:58:51,138 --> 00:58:53,138
No.

883
00:58:58,832 --> 00:59:00,312
Who's the boss right now?

884
00:59:18,651 --> 00:59:20,651
Grace, God, pull over.

885
00:59:21,611 --> 00:59:23,378
Grace, pull over. Listen.

886
00:59:23,403 --> 00:59:24,651
I'm trying to help you.

887
00:59:24,676 --> 00:59:25,344
Grace!

888
00:59:32,651 --> 00:59:33,632
I need ..... .

889
00:59:38,611 --> 00:59:40,611
Grace.

890
01:00:04,065 --> 01:00:05,898
Are you okay?

891
01:00:06,040 --> 01:00:08,040
No, no. Put the pulse.

892
01:00:08,065 --> 01:00:10,065
I'm not picking you.

893
01:00:13,879 --> 01:00:14,983
Gave me your hand.

894
01:00:15,276 --> 01:00:15,866
...

895
01:00:17,029 --> 01:00:17,763
It's okay.

896
01:00:18,536 --> 01:00:19,109
So ok.

897
01:00:19,897 --> 01:00:21,635
Is every thing good?
Are you Ok?

898
01:00:22,122 --> 01:00:22,928
- You okay?
- Hunt

899
01:00:24,415 --> 01:00:25,008
No.

900
01:00:26,162 --> 01:00:27,642
Let the girl go.

901
01:00:28,082 --> 01:00:29,516
Put the bracelets on.

902
01:00:30,543 --> 01:00:31,669
There you go.

903
01:00:31,891 --> 01:00:32,816
Put them on.

904
01:00:32,956 --> 01:00:33,483
Do it.

905
01:00:34,657 --> 01:00:36,223
He's not going to shoot you.

906
01:00:39,961 --> 01:00:40,888
Drop weapon down.

907
01:00:42,388 --> 01:00:45,128
Special Operations..
He is a tourist.

908
01:00:45,821 --> 01:00:47,891
God, stay with the God.
Get rid of those women.

909
01:00:48,614 --> 01:00:49,891
Hunt, listen to me.

910
01:00:49,891 --> 01:00:52,591
Listen to me. Let her go and put them on.

911
01:00:54,604 --> 01:00:55,867
Drop the weapon now.

912
01:00:55,892 --> 01:00:56,807
Under control.

913
01:00:56,997 --> 01:00:57,731
It's okay.

914
01:00:57,758 --> 01:00:58,471
It's okay.

915
01:01:03,159 --> 01:01:04,522
Everybody, down now.

916
01:01:04,547 --> 01:01:05,082
Down.

917
01:01:10,041 --> 01:01:11,260
- To the ground.
- Cover me.

918
01:01:11,285 --> 01:01:12,160
Cover me.

919
01:01:43,559 --> 01:01:44,806
- You driving.
- What?

920
01:01:45,259 --> 01:01:47,259
No, no, no, no, no.

921
01:01:48,159 --> 01:01:49,699
Go, go, go. Hit the accelerator.

922
01:01:49,724 --> 01:01:51,724
Go, go, go, go, go, go.

923
01:02:00,159 --> 01:02:02,159
Go, go, go.

924
01:02:18,559 --> 01:02:19,559
Jump In !

925
01:02:20,261 --> 01:02:21,926
You good, just keep going.

926
01:02:21,951 --> 01:02:23,386
Don't stop, don't stop

927
01:02:28,286 --> 01:02:30,286
Down.

928
01:02:33,472 --> 01:02:34,645
Car, car, car.

929
01:02:42,905 --> 01:02:43,738
It's okay.

930
01:02:43,899 --> 01:02:45,158
Put on the brake, start the car.

931
01:02:45,958 --> 01:02:47,425
Wait, wait, wait.

932
01:02:47,450 --> 01:02:50,105
- What's happening?
- I'm done. I'm not doing this.

933
01:02:50,130 --> 01:02:51,838
People are chasing us.

934
01:02:51,863 --> 01:02:52,865
Yes, they are.

935
01:02:52,890 --> 01:02:54,416
You drive, now come on.

936
01:03:26,072 --> 01:03:27,518
Who is that person?

937
01:03:28,205 --> 01:03:29,585
I have no idea.

938
01:03:34,365 --> 01:03:36,344
- Are you okay?
- I will be when this is over.

939
01:03:39,244 --> 01:03:40,624
Oh, no.

940
01:03:44,598 --> 01:03:45,917
It's okay, it's okay.

941
01:03:58,751 --> 01:04:00,517
Is everyone not chasing us?

942
01:04:00,917 --> 01:04:02,751
We've got to get rid of this car.

943
01:04:05,126 --> 01:04:06,360
Speeders? Damn it.

944
01:04:28,217 --> 01:04:29,865
What are we doing?
S A V E   C A R

945
01:04:31,691 --> 01:04:33,035
Finding us a new car.

946
01:04:54,974 --> 01:04:55,826
OK.

947
01:05:13,456 --> 01:05:14,892
- Just give me a second.
- Yeah.

948
01:05:15,015 --> 01:05:16,532
- Thanks, OK
- Yes.

949
01:05:16,749 --> 01:05:18,032
- You ready?
- I'm ready.

950
01:05:22,266 --> 01:05:22,873
Wow.

951
01:05:23,054 --> 01:05:23,801
You okay?

952
01:05:24,701 --> 01:05:26,701
Hey, look, this is ...

953
01:05:27,064 --> 01:05:28,647
- It's Ok.
No, the way they ...

954
01:05:29,477 --> 01:05:29,824
It's Ok.

955
01:05:29,824 --> 01:05:31,924
No, the way they set them up sometimes it's just ...

956
01:05:31,928 --> 01:05:32,488
Let's go.

957
01:05:32,512 --> 01:05:34,117
thing takes me.
- Let's go.

958
01:05:42,217 --> 01:05:43,217
To all units

959
01:05:43,266 --> 01:05:46,576
"The cameraman recognized the woman"

960
01:05:46,601 --> 01:05:48,610
"Drives a yellow Fiat 500"

961
01:06:05,187 --> 01:06:06,846
Now, I got you.

962
01:06:16,233 --> 01:06:17,579
Looks like we lost them.

963
01:06:24,233 --> 01:06:26,233
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

964
01:06:43,179 --> 01:06:44,179
Jesus!

965
01:06:44,525 --> 01:06:46,165
Give Way.

966
01:07:02,799 --> 01:07:04,799
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby.

967
01:07:17,212 --> 01:07:18,032
What's that?

968
01:07:19,485 --> 01:07:20,639
No, no, no.

969
01:07:25,994 --> 01:07:27,386
Go, go, go, go.

970
01:07:40,118 --> 01:07:42,250
- We are on fire.
- No, no, no.

971
01:07:42,619 --> 01:07:44,410
It's the tires, just try to go straight.

972
01:07:46,266 --> 01:07:48,045
- Hang on, hang on.
- We are spinning.

973
01:07:49,899 --> 01:07:50,919
Good, good, good.

974
01:07:53,632 --> 01:07:56,322
I've got it, I've got it,
I've got it, I've got it.

975
01:07:56,879 --> 01:07:58,892
Turn right, turn right,
down there, get, wait, go.

976
01:08:08,072 --> 01:08:09,511
Gotta go right, turn right.

977
01:08:11,898 --> 01:08:13,718
- Who is driving?
- You driving, you driving

978
01:08:14,278 --> 01:08:15,951
Go, go, go, go, go, just
go straight, go straight.

979
01:08:17,045 --> 01:08:19,451
Go, go, go, just keep going
straight, keep going straight.

980
01:08:20,624 --> 01:08:23,045
Go left, go left, go, go,
go, go, go, go, go, go.

981
01:08:23,045 --> 01:08:24,231
You're doing good.

982
01:08:29,814 --> 01:08:31,814
Cops, cops, a lot of cops.

983
01:08:32,275 --> 01:08:34,109
Ho you, Take the wheel.

984
01:08:34,134 --> 01:08:35,129
Wait, wait, wait.

985
01:08:41,279 --> 01:08:42,399
Take your wheel.

986
01:08:45,013 --> 01:08:46,846
Straight, straight, straight, straight.

987
01:08:46,871 --> 01:08:47,623
Go ahead.

988
01:08:56,659 --> 01:08:59,045
- Which way now?
Left, left, left, left, left, left.-

989
01:09:07,278 --> 01:09:08,672
All right,Good, good.

990
01:09:13,619 --> 01:09:14,458
It's tough person.

991
01:09:17,124 --> 01:09:18,511
- Okay, car, car.
- I can't.

992
01:09:45,718 --> 01:09:46,512
Hey there.

993
01:09:53,990 --> 01:09:54,990
They going.

994
01:10:07,020 --> 01:10:09,526
- What is happening? Where are we going?
- I don't know.

995
01:10:11,246 --> 01:10:12,413
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

996
01:10:41,918 --> 01:10:43,113
Don't hate me.

997
01:10:46,660 --> 01:10:48,286
Grace, Grace!

998
01:11:03,697 --> 01:11:04,697
Come on.

999
01:11:33,061 --> 01:11:33,914
Ethan!

1000
01:11:34,678 --> 01:11:35,301
Ethan!

1001
01:11:39,634 --> 01:11:41,422
Well, come on.

1002
01:12:36,464 --> 01:12:39,004
All right, we know Grace
has won half of the key.

1003
01:12:39,029 --> 01:12:41,504
We also know she's going
to be at the Dukali at midnight.

1004
01:12:41,690 --> 01:12:45,017
And now we have a pretty good idea as to
who is going to be waiting for her there.

1005
01:12:45,431 --> 01:12:47,404
The event is being
hosted by none other than

1006
01:12:47,429 --> 01:12:49,064
our favourite international arms trafficker

1007
01:12:49,089 --> 01:12:51,204
and black marketeer, Alana Mitsophilis.

1008
01:12:51,464 --> 01:12:53,284
The white widow.

1009
01:12:53,684 --> 01:12:55,464
Does she know who you actually are?

1010
01:12:55,464 --> 01:12:59,187
or does she still think you're the globally
notorious mass murderer at John Locke?

1011
01:12:59,212 --> 01:13:00,417
Who says I'm not?

1012
01:13:01,300 --> 01:13:03,393
Didn't she put a price
on your hidden parents?

1013
01:13:03,418 --> 01:13:04,586
She did indeed.

1014
01:13:04,866 --> 01:13:07,686
She and Ethan, they worked it out.

1015
01:13:08,184 --> 01:13:11,664
- You never did tell me how.
- Can we continue, please?

1016
01:13:12,179 --> 01:13:12,614
Right.

1017
01:13:12,639 --> 01:13:15,544
So, assuming we get the
complete key at the party tonight,

1018
01:13:15,569 --> 01:13:17,245
we still don't know what it unlocks,

1019
01:13:17,270 --> 01:13:18,892
so we need to find somebody who does.

1020
01:13:18,917 --> 01:13:21,605
The question is where to start looking.

1021
01:13:21,630 --> 01:13:24,963
We figured that the bond didn't just
walk into the airport by itself, right?

1022
01:13:24,988 --> 01:13:25,988
Somebody put it there.

1023
01:13:26,283 --> 01:13:28,450
Somebody working for the entity.

1024
01:13:28,756 --> 01:13:31,863
This is everything I captured from
the security cameras at the airport.

1025
01:13:32,096 --> 01:13:34,546
Up to the minute everything went haywire.

1026
01:13:34,571 --> 01:13:37,571
This is defeat from your AR sunglasses.

1027
01:13:37,706 --> 01:13:40,926
I've been running facial
recognition on everyone in the airport.

1028
01:13:40,999 --> 01:13:42,501
See anything strange?

1029
01:13:45,601 --> 01:13:46,706
It's like a ghost.

1030
01:13:47,367 --> 01:13:48,966
Ghosts don't have reflections.

1031
01:13:52,386 --> 01:13:55,497
The only person in the
airport with no identity.

1032
01:13:56,537 --> 01:14:03,105
The only man who can't be found anyplace
else in the airport except that reflection.

1033
01:14:04,310 --> 01:14:07,783
He's being erased in real time.

1034
01:14:14,550 --> 01:14:18,495
The entity is protecting him.

1035
01:14:19,202 --> 01:14:21,129
You saw him, didn't you?

1036
01:14:23,516 --> 01:14:24,956
I wasn't sure.

1037
01:14:26,642 --> 01:14:27,963
Well, who is he?

1038
01:14:35,142 --> 01:14:43,771
Someone I thought died a long
time ago in another life before the IMF.

1039
01:14:44,963 --> 01:14:47,524
If I was offered the choice.

1040
01:14:50,903 --> 01:14:55,491
In a very real sense, he
made me who I am today.

1041
01:14:57,289 --> 01:14:58,489
Does he have a name?

1042
01:14:59,509 --> 01:15:01,413
He calls himself Gabriel.

1043
01:15:04,589 --> 01:15:05,542
You know him?

1044
01:15:08,249 --> 01:15:10,089
There is no knowing him.

1045
01:15:11,202 --> 01:15:13,217
He has no recorded past.

1046
01:15:13,722 --> 01:15:15,282
The entity made sure of that.

1047
01:15:16,622 --> 01:15:20,599
He's a dark messiah, the
entity's chosen messenger.

1048
01:15:21,209 --> 01:15:27,231
And he sees death as a gift he
wants to share with the rest of the world.

1049
01:15:28,208 --> 01:15:29,358
How do you know that?

1050
01:15:29,515 --> 01:15:32,194
I still have a few friends left in MI6.

1051
01:15:33,081 --> 01:15:37,324
Friends who are afraid of the British
government gaining control of the entity.

1052
01:15:38,307 --> 01:15:41,394
Any attempt to try and stop them
would be seen as an act of treason.

1053
01:15:41,827 --> 01:15:43,706
Because you're disavowed.

1054
01:15:43,941 --> 01:15:46,947
Your friends called and asked you for help.

1055
01:15:47,254 --> 01:15:49,253
They knew Gabriel served the entity.

1056
01:15:50,100 --> 01:15:55,801
They knew he was on his way to Istanbul
to acquire one half of a cruciform key.

1057
01:15:56,880 --> 01:15:59,800
So they beat him to it.

1058
01:16:01,120 --> 01:16:03,225
And when Kittridge put
a bounty on your head,

1059
01:16:04,320 --> 01:16:06,186
we went to the desert to hide.

1060
01:16:06,860 --> 01:16:09,200
Somehow the bounty
hunters found you anyway.

1061
01:16:09,320 --> 01:16:09,866
Yes.

1062
01:16:10,366 --> 01:16:14,406
So did these friends of yours
happen to say what the key unlocks?

1063
01:16:14,800 --> 01:16:18,451
MI6 suspects it bleeds somehow
to the entity's source code.

1064
01:16:19,298 --> 01:16:20,431
Source code?

1065
01:16:21,638 --> 01:16:23,078
When were you going to tell me this?

1066
01:16:24,151 --> 01:16:25,352
I'm telling you now.

1067
01:16:26,995 --> 01:16:29,241
Your friends at MI6
said they'd contact you.

1068
01:16:29,548 --> 01:16:32,261
- Did you speak with them, face to face?
- I'm disavowed.

1069
01:16:32,995 --> 01:16:36,842
They couldn't risk meeting me
in person, so all communication.

1070
01:16:39,247 --> 01:16:40,261
Electronic.

1071
01:16:41,074 --> 01:16:41,841
Digital.

1072
01:16:45,907 --> 01:16:47,706
We can't be sure that was the entity.

1073
01:16:47,994 --> 01:16:49,681
We can't be sure it wasn't.

1074
01:16:49,802 --> 01:16:53,317
We can't be sure anything is real
outside of this very conversation.

1075
01:16:54,889 --> 01:16:56,142
Non of you should be here.

1076
01:16:56,201 --> 01:16:58,706
You don't know Gabriel. I do.

1077
01:16:58,835 --> 01:17:00,353
It's not the killing he enjoys.

1078
01:17:00,806 --> 01:17:02,339
It's the suffering he causes.

1079
01:17:02,492 --> 01:17:06,622
And he knows the best way to
get to me is through all of you.

1080
01:17:08,019 --> 01:17:09,706
And if Gabriel knows me...

1081
01:17:10,119 --> 01:17:11,706
The entity knows.

1082
01:17:11,706 --> 01:17:14,129
There's a reason he wants me here there's.

1083
01:17:15,052 --> 01:17:18,052
There's a reason he wants
you here, it wants you here.

1084
01:17:18,206 --> 01:17:21,853
Who or what is the most
important thing to you?

1085
01:17:22,938 --> 01:17:24,980
- You'll have to go.
- You all have to go.

1086
01:17:25,005 --> 01:17:28,159
- Ethan, what if it wants us to leave?
- Like you made us leave the airport.

1087
01:17:28,184 --> 01:17:30,649
And what if it wants you
alone at that party tonight?

1088
01:17:30,674 --> 01:17:32,827
Can I go alone? At least I don't
have all of you to worry about.

1089
01:17:32,852 --> 01:17:35,097
This is exactly why I
didn't want to tell you.

1090
01:17:35,122 --> 01:17:38,621
Ethan, you're playing four-dimensional
chess with an algorithm.

1091
01:17:38,768 --> 01:17:40,581
The entity knows who we are.

1092
01:17:40,606 --> 01:17:42,706
Any move we make, it's probably considered.

1093
01:17:42,706 --> 01:17:46,156
Anything we do, we have to
assume that it's counting on us to do it.

1094
01:17:46,181 --> 01:17:49,706
If you want to beat this thing,
you have to start thinking like it.

1095
01:17:50,187 --> 01:17:53,421
Cold, logical, unemotional.

1096
01:17:53,821 --> 01:17:56,934
If that key really does
ground control of the entity,

1097
01:17:57,461 --> 01:18:00,509
Gabriel is the last person
on Earth who shall have it.

1098
01:18:00,637 --> 01:18:04,706
That's right, Ethan. Gabriel
cannot have that key.

1099
01:18:05,410 --> 01:18:09,559
And none of our lives can
matter more than this mission.

1100
01:18:36,503 --> 01:18:38,511
I don't accept that.

1101
01:19:04,549 --> 01:19:06,533
It's my first time in Venice.

1102
01:19:10,704 --> 01:19:12,164
It's mine too.

1103
01:20:13,463 --> 01:20:14,449
Why do you drink?

1104
01:20:15,413 --> 01:20:17,249
I'm waiting for someone.

1105
01:20:17,696 --> 01:20:18,742
So am I.

1106
01:20:20,734 --> 01:20:22,067
We can wait together.

1107
01:20:22,914 --> 01:20:23,694
I have Gabriel.

1108
01:20:24,114 --> 01:20:25,254
If you say so...

1109
01:20:25,781 --> 01:20:27,001
And your brakes.

1110
01:20:37,124 --> 01:20:38,496
I don't have it on me.

1111
01:20:38,657 --> 01:20:39,677
I wouldn't expect you to.

1112
01:20:40,856 --> 01:20:43,189
In any case, I'm not here for the key.

1113
01:20:43,522 --> 01:20:44,596
What do you want?

1114
01:20:44,621 --> 01:20:47,896
Suppose while we're
waiting, I tell you a little story.

1115
01:20:47,921 --> 01:20:50,069
Oh, you're obviously not the
person I came here to meet.

1116
01:20:50,094 --> 01:20:51,662
It's your story, Grace.

1117
01:20:53,050 --> 01:20:54,375
I know how it ends.

1118
01:20:56,196 --> 01:20:58,609
Let me buy you a drink and
perhaps you can change it.

1119
01:21:26,534 --> 01:21:28,049
Let's go to a party.

1120
01:21:35,987 --> 01:21:37,100
Excuse me, sir.

1121
01:21:39,330 --> 01:21:40,896
Could you please follow me?

1122
01:21:42,797 --> 01:21:46,330
It's important you understand
that you're not unique.

1123
01:21:47,230 --> 01:21:50,550
Thirty years ago, our name was Marie.

1124
01:21:51,023 --> 01:21:54,123
The first of many women
who trusted our mutual friend.

1125
01:21:54,290 --> 01:21:56,630
Women will all have
something that you wants.

1126
01:21:57,303 --> 01:21:59,950
Women were all in over their heads.

1127
01:21:59,975 --> 01:22:01,416
Or so he tells them.

1128
01:22:01,987 --> 01:22:03,084
Sound familiar?

1129
01:22:03,673 --> 01:22:05,504
What happened to Marie?

1130
01:22:05,529 --> 01:22:08,086
Same thing that happens
to all the women he uses.

1131
01:22:09,193 --> 01:22:11,918
As well as anyone else
who touches that key.

1132
01:22:12,285 --> 01:22:14,279
Is he just cares whether people ever die?

1133
01:22:14,304 --> 01:22:17,479
He cares only about his objective.

1134
01:22:18,873 --> 01:22:21,311
And right now, the only
thing standing his way..

1135
01:22:21,405 --> 01:22:22,405
is you.

1136
01:22:23,731 --> 01:22:26,193
- Why should I believe you?
- You shouldn't.

1137
01:22:26,278 --> 01:22:28,641
You've stepped into a world of lies, Grace.

1138
01:22:28,853 --> 01:22:30,415
Nothing anyone says is true.

1139
01:22:31,006 --> 01:22:32,541
Just remember that...

1140
01:22:32,569 --> 01:22:34,569
And he promises to protect you.

1141
01:22:34,569 --> 01:22:35,575
Grace.

1142
01:22:49,801 --> 01:22:51,431
It's been a long time, isn't it?

1143
01:22:52,525 --> 01:22:55,005
You should've killed me
when you're at the chance.

1144
01:22:56,058 --> 01:22:57,905
Good evening, everyone.

1145
01:22:58,878 --> 01:23:00,898
It isn't John Lark.

1146
01:23:02,258 --> 01:23:04,224
Except it isn't, actually.

1147
01:23:05,044 --> 01:23:08,258
But until you're ready
to tell me your real name,

1148
01:23:08,283 --> 01:23:09,544
Lark will have to do.

1149
01:23:10,784 --> 01:23:12,737
It's good to see your mother.

1150
01:23:16,037 --> 01:23:18,952
And your Gabriel, I presume.

1151
01:23:19,471 --> 01:23:22,150
I've heard so very little about you.

1152
01:23:22,590 --> 01:23:25,750
Aren't you so much more
handsome than Gerson?

1153
01:23:28,303 --> 01:23:30,422
Such a gentleman, too.

1154
01:23:35,517 --> 01:23:37,596
And you must be Grace.

1155
01:23:40,503 --> 01:23:42,767
Should I know you?

1156
01:23:42,792 --> 01:23:45,792
I believe you have something for me.

1157
01:23:45,817 --> 01:23:47,224
You hired me.

1158
01:23:47,717 --> 01:23:49,411
Oh, I have picked you.

1159
01:24:03,077 --> 01:24:03,913
You done.

1160
01:24:24,991 --> 01:24:26,003
She doesn't have it.

1161
01:24:27,404 --> 01:24:28,480
Where is it?

1162
01:24:28,864 --> 01:24:31,316
It's in the last place you
would ever think to look.

1163
01:24:34,237 --> 01:24:36,321
Why don't we go upstairs and have a drink?

1164
01:24:40,564 --> 01:24:42,236
Hey, hey, where are you going?

1165
01:24:42,261 --> 01:24:44,329
This is the second
floor. You can't go there.

1166
01:24:55,551 --> 01:24:56,256
Damn.

1167
01:24:56,705 --> 01:24:59,705
As most of you know, I am merely a broker.

1168
01:25:00,394 --> 01:25:03,256
I connect a buyer and a
seller sometimes for money,

1169
01:25:03,281 --> 01:25:07,434
sometimes for information,
but mostly for friendship.

1170
01:25:08,488 --> 01:25:10,939
I just want everyone to get along.

1171
01:25:12,281 --> 01:25:14,192
With me, especially.

1172
01:25:14,846 --> 01:25:17,632
But.. the world is changing.

1173
01:25:17,986 --> 01:25:19,499
Truth is vanishing.

1174
01:25:20,019 --> 01:25:21,783
War is coming.

1175
01:25:21,999 --> 01:25:25,060
And the key to world
domination is, of all things,

1176
01:25:25,600 --> 01:25:26,621
a key.

1177
01:25:27,474 --> 01:25:30,291
One with the power to control the entity.

1178
01:25:31,147 --> 01:25:32,962
One that any government in the world,

1179
01:25:32,987 --> 01:25:35,630
would pay a king's ransom
to take possession of.

1180
01:25:36,620 --> 01:25:38,925
And some of my dearest
friends, in this case,

1181
01:25:38,950 --> 01:25:41,950
every major nuclear power
and handful of minor ones,

1182
01:25:42,053 --> 01:25:43,960
have asked me to deliver this key.

1183
01:25:43,985 --> 01:25:44,985
Of course.

1184
01:25:45,598 --> 01:25:46,843
If you do find the key,

1185
01:25:46,868 --> 01:25:49,053
you'll be forced to confront
any possible dilemma.

1186
01:25:49,053 --> 01:25:52,053
Whoever you give the key
to will be forever in your debt.

1187
01:25:52,396 --> 01:25:55,775
But to the rest of the
world, you'll be an enemy.

1188
01:25:56,331 --> 01:25:57,884
Oh, I like her.

1189
01:25:57,978 --> 01:26:00,271
What's your relationship with him?

1190
01:26:00,604 --> 01:26:03,378
Gabriel represents
another interested party.

1191
01:26:03,778 --> 01:26:09,764
In fact, this party was
arranged by that interested party.

1192
01:26:10,157 --> 01:26:14,337
You could even say that this
party is that interested party.

1193
01:26:48,025 --> 01:26:49,164
Is this...

1194
01:26:50,138 --> 01:26:51,247
the entity?

1195
01:26:53,571 --> 01:26:55,717
And so the clock thickens.

1196
01:26:56,571 --> 01:26:59,404
Do I give the key to one of my old friends,

1197
01:26:59,651 --> 01:27:03,157
or do I hand it and my fate over
to Gabriel and his...

1198
01:27:03,370 --> 01:27:05,224
nfantile machine?

1199
01:27:06,921 --> 01:27:10,225
What makes you so sure
you'll get the completed key?

1200
01:27:11,854 --> 01:27:13,436
You have one half of it.

1201
01:27:13,634 --> 01:27:15,104
And she knows.

1202
01:27:15,747 --> 01:27:17,974
Where the other half is.

1203
01:27:20,311 --> 01:27:22,529
Assuming we can get it,

1204
01:27:23,437 --> 01:27:26,921
why don't you just keep the key
and all that power for yourself?

1205
01:27:26,921 --> 01:27:29,452
Because she doesn't know what it unlocks

1206
01:27:29,837 --> 01:27:31,496
any more than the rest of us.

1207
01:27:32,810 --> 01:27:35,197
It's like at night we
have to choose a suitor.

1208
01:27:35,297 --> 01:27:37,669
Does it tastefully put it out?

1209
01:27:38,230 --> 01:27:38,921
It's cheap.

1210
01:27:39,150 --> 01:27:42,006
Of course, I know what it unlocks.

1211
01:27:43,137 --> 01:27:45,550
And what's he offering for the key?

1212
01:27:45,635 --> 01:27:47,403
As I've explained to Grace before,

1213
01:27:47,428 --> 01:27:49,123
I'm not here for any key,

1214
01:27:49,388 --> 01:27:51,757
as I'll have both halves in hand tomorrow.

1215
01:27:52,307 --> 01:27:54,180
What makes you so certain about that?

1216
01:27:54,205 --> 01:27:56,980
You've no idea the power I represent.

1217
01:27:57,167 --> 01:28:00,733
Thousands of quadrillions of
computations per millisecond.

1218
01:28:00,907 --> 01:28:03,947
Something manipulating
the minds of billions.

1219
01:28:04,120 --> 01:28:06,948
While parsing every
possible cause and effect.

1220
01:28:07,113 --> 01:28:08,588
Every scenario, however,

1221
01:28:08,613 --> 01:28:13,675
implausible into a very real
map of a most probable next.

1222
01:28:14,307 --> 01:28:16,749
And with only a few changes to the present,

1223
01:28:17,631 --> 01:28:20,086
the future is all but assured.

1224
01:28:21,411 --> 01:28:23,131
The key will come to me.

1225
01:28:24,133 --> 01:28:25,118
Tomorrow.

1226
01:28:26,052 --> 01:28:29,052
On the Orient Express, on for Innsbruck.

1227
01:28:29,052 --> 01:28:29,818
Innsbruck?

1228
01:28:30,492 --> 01:28:31,848
It knows...

1229
01:28:32,265 --> 01:28:34,885
It knows that you've
already chosen your suitor.

1230
01:28:35,412 --> 01:28:38,653
It knows that you intend to
make the two halves of the key

1231
01:28:38,678 --> 01:28:41,118
in a desperate grasp of control.

1232
01:28:41,143 --> 01:28:44,285
I, however, have been
promised the completed key

1233
01:28:44,310 --> 01:28:45,862
to lay itself at my feet.

1234
01:28:46,726 --> 01:28:48,546
Provide someone dies.

1235
01:28:49,125 --> 01:28:50,116
Tonight.

1236
01:28:51,514 --> 01:28:52,139
Who?

1237
01:28:53,165 --> 01:28:54,078
Her.

1238
01:28:55,828 --> 01:28:57,498
Or her.

1239
01:28:59,335 --> 01:29:01,582
And you will bear witness, Ethan.

1240
01:29:01,855 --> 01:29:05,492
The key will be mine, and I will be gone.

1241
01:29:05,655 --> 01:29:08,008
Like smoke in a hurricane.

1242
01:29:08,265 --> 01:29:11,141
But only after someone you care about dies.

1243
01:29:13,492 --> 01:29:14,807
it is written.

1244
01:29:16,418 --> 01:29:17,644
You see what this is?

1245
01:29:18,594 --> 01:29:19,774
Don't you?

1246
01:29:21,159 --> 01:29:22,857
He's afraid.

1247
01:29:23,646 --> 01:29:25,106
It's afraid.

1248
01:29:26,272 --> 01:29:28,321
Somehow it knows we're close.

1249
01:29:29,159 --> 01:29:31,159
Why else would you be here?

1250
01:29:31,392 --> 01:29:32,302
Help me.

1251
01:29:32,327 --> 01:29:35,327
Help me complete the
key, and I will kill this thing.

1252
01:29:35,352 --> 01:29:38,847
- It knows your every secret, Alana.
- The business is fanatic.

1253
01:29:38,939 --> 01:29:42,617
- Help him, and you'll die too.
- Help him, everyone dies.

1254
01:29:42,758 --> 01:29:44,462
I'll see you tomorrow.

1255
01:29:46,572 --> 01:29:47,715
Alana.

1256
01:29:54,939 --> 01:29:56,709
His fate is written.

1257
01:29:57,289 --> 01:29:59,435
Shall we write yours too?

1258
01:30:00,349 --> 01:30:01,349
Alana.

1259
01:30:04,459 --> 01:30:05,608
I'm sorry.

1260
01:30:06,019 --> 01:30:07,276
Locke.

1261
01:30:17,974 --> 01:30:21,790
For old time's sake.
How did you choose which one?

1262
01:30:22,188 --> 01:30:23,188
Yielsa?

1263
01:30:23,694 --> 01:30:24,694
Or Grace?

1264
01:30:25,341 --> 01:30:26,237
Kill him, Zola.

1265
01:30:26,262 --> 01:30:27,262
Kill him.

1266
01:30:27,287 --> 01:30:28,287
Kill him where he stands.

1267
01:30:28,501 --> 01:30:30,216
The choice is yours then, Alana.

1268
01:30:30,216 --> 01:30:33,594
Though I'll remind you, Grace
knows where half the key is.

1269
01:30:34,928 --> 01:30:37,621
If anything happens to either of them,

1270
01:30:37,901 --> 01:30:41,936
there is no place on earth where you
or your God will be saved from me...

1271
01:30:42,229 --> 01:30:44,587
There's no place that I won't go
 to kill you, All that...

1272
01:30:44,994 --> 01:30:46,216
is written.

1273
01:30:46,216 --> 01:30:47,641
It's good to see you all friend.

1274
01:30:54,209 --> 01:30:55,533
I'll be in too.

1275
01:31:20,617 --> 01:31:25,837
- You have made a terrible mistake.
- My life is on the line here.

1276
01:31:26,610 --> 01:31:28,710
I have to be on that train tomorrow.

1277
01:31:29,990 --> 01:31:32,278
And I have to have that key.

1278
01:31:33,890 --> 01:31:36,837
And I do not care how I get it.

1279
01:31:41,104 --> 01:31:42,104
Don't move.

1280
01:31:47,903 --> 01:31:49,345
Let us fight again.

1281
01:32:29,961 --> 01:32:30,878
What a fuck...?

1282
01:33:34,491 --> 01:33:35,491
Grace!

1283
01:33:36,863 --> 01:33:37,363
Grace!

1284
01:33:43,837 --> 01:33:46,837
Don't move.

1285
01:33:52,969 --> 01:33:55,313
Luther, Benjie, if you hear me
 I need eyes.

1286
01:33:55,338 --> 01:33:57,784
Grace just leave me at the
collar yard before she has the key.

1287
01:33:57,809 --> 01:33:59,931
- We're here, go.
- I need to find her. Where is she?

1288
01:34:01,015 --> 01:34:03,204
Damn it! I've lost pitch only
 for another satellite.

1289
01:34:03,229 --> 01:34:05,550
Hack you, russian Xenophore Spy satellite!

1290
01:34:05,575 --> 01:34:07,262
So scrape in the barrel,
but it'll have to do it.

1291
01:34:15,960 --> 01:34:16,776
This way.

1292
01:34:36,562 --> 01:34:37,338
Oh my god.

1293
01:34:37,801 --> 01:34:40,114
- Where am I going? Come on, come on.
- Stand by, stand by.

1294
01:34:40,139 --> 01:34:40,807
She's hurrying.

1295
01:34:40,901 --> 01:34:43,861
- She's just north of you crossing the bridge.
- Repeat Benji.

1296
01:34:43,886 --> 01:34:46,274
Head north, Aiden.
She's crossing the bridge.

1297
01:35:03,562 --> 01:35:06,217
- Ethen, take the passage to your right.
- I see her.

1298
01:35:06,242 --> 01:35:08,391
Cross that narrow alley and turn left.

1299
01:35:08,995 --> 01:35:11,330
- I'm losing picture again.
- Looking for another.

1300
01:35:11,462 --> 01:35:15,228
The entity is not your satellite's
faster than I can act until the end.

1301
01:35:15,562 --> 01:35:17,562
Aiden, I have to go to the right.

1302
01:35:40,227 --> 01:35:41,867
Benji, I don't see her.
Where is she?

1303
01:35:41,892 --> 01:35:44,173
- Go down the narrow street and turn left.
- Ok, copy that.

1304
01:35:45,880 --> 01:35:46,880
Turn right.

1305
01:35:46,905 --> 01:35:49,202
Sorry, my mistake. I'm
never left. I'm never left.

1306
01:35:49,227 --> 01:35:50,369
Oh my God.

1307
01:35:50,799 --> 01:35:53,799
Ethan our comms have been breached.
You're talking to the entity.

1308
01:35:53,946 --> 01:35:57,196
Turn left. Turn right.
Take the bridge to your left.

1309
01:35:57,232 --> 01:36:00,296
- Ethen, that is not me. Do you copy?
- Ethen, come in.

1310
01:36:00,540 --> 01:36:04,319
(... )Turn left. Turn left. Turn left.

1311
01:36:06,332 --> 01:36:08,227
- Try to re-establish comms.
- Wait, where are you going?

1312
01:36:08,227 --> 01:36:11,590
- I'm going to try and find Ethen.
- Go to the empty alley and turn right.

1313
01:36:11,615 --> 01:36:15,235
Ethen, grace about 800 meters in
front of you. Take that passage.

1314
01:36:24,820 --> 01:36:28,325
- Wait,wait, not that way, not that way.
-Which way? Which way?

1315
01:36:28,820 --> 01:36:31,293
- Wait. Left or right?
- It doesn't matter.

1316
01:36:32,820 --> 01:36:34,480
What do you mean it
doesn't matter? Where is she?

1317
01:36:34,727 --> 01:36:37,246
She's on her way to the Minnich Bridge.

1318
01:36:38,713 --> 01:36:40,240
Where Gabriel is waiting.

1319
01:36:41,613 --> 01:36:43,233
You will never get there in time.

1320
01:36:44,540 --> 01:36:46,320
But you can, Elsa.

1321
01:36:47,659 --> 01:36:50,180
I know what matters most to you, Ethan.

1322
01:36:50,873 --> 01:36:53,516
- Is this a friendship?
- No, it's not.

1323
01:36:54,613 --> 01:36:55,953
But you are done.

1324
01:37:19,764 --> 01:37:20,764
So be it.

1325
01:39:57,267 --> 01:39:59,017
I was hoping it would be you.

1326
01:43:29,135 --> 01:43:30,452
Sorry.

1327
01:43:31,755 --> 01:43:33,399
On the name...

1328
01:43:33,552 --> 01:43:34,259
Luther.

1329
01:43:36,499 --> 01:43:37,302
Benji.

1330
01:43:39,112 --> 01:43:40,340
Um, uh,

1331
01:43:41,320 --> 01:43:42,320
Elsa.

1332
01:43:44,166 --> 01:43:45,166
Are you close?

1333
01:43:46,535 --> 01:43:47,535
You and she?

1334
01:43:48,386 --> 01:43:49,386
In all way.

1335
01:43:52,469 --> 01:43:53,969
I'm the reason she's dead.

1336
01:43:53,994 --> 01:43:54,642
No.

1337
01:43:55,073 --> 01:43:56,772
She's the reason you're alive.

1338
01:43:57,538 --> 01:43:59,073
And that's the truth.

1339
01:43:59,438 --> 01:44:01,158
I don't know how to feel about it.

1340
01:44:01,438 --> 01:44:03,338
You probably never will.

1341
01:44:04,999 --> 01:44:06,031
I'm so sorry.

1342
01:44:08,413 --> 01:44:10,073
Is there anything I could do to help?

1343
01:44:10,713 --> 01:44:13,073
That's what we'd like to talk to you about.

1344
01:44:14,685 --> 01:44:16,851
In a little over three hours,

1345
01:44:17,211 --> 01:44:20,345
the white widow was expected
to be on the Orient Express

1346
01:44:20,491 --> 01:44:21,672
to Innsbruck,

1347
01:44:21,898 --> 01:44:26,073
where buyers waiting to take receipt of
 the complete, unverified key.

1348
01:44:26,073 --> 01:44:28,073
But she doesn't have the complete key.

1349
01:44:28,225 --> 01:44:29,721
That widow doesn't.

1350
01:44:31,880 --> 01:44:33,048
But ours could.

1351
01:44:33,501 --> 01:44:34,073
What..

1352
01:44:34,547 --> 01:44:35,644
is that?

1353
01:44:36,574 --> 01:44:38,454
Your chance to be someone else.

1354
01:44:38,714 --> 01:44:41,574
- I don't understand.
- We're not going to lie to you, Grace.

1355
01:44:41,574 --> 01:44:42,729
You had a lot of trouble.

1356
01:44:42,754 --> 01:44:45,574
The number of fake passports
is going to get you out of this one.

1357
01:44:45,574 --> 01:44:48,574
- Governments know who you are.
- The white widow knows.

1358
01:44:48,574 --> 01:44:50,398
And the entity knows.

1359
01:44:50,423 --> 01:44:53,396
Your future boils down
to three options now.

1360
01:44:53,514 --> 01:44:54,314
Prison.

1361
01:44:54,749 --> 01:44:55,549
Death.

1362
01:44:55,901 --> 01:44:56,901
Or the choice.

1363
01:44:57,761 --> 01:44:58,761
The choice.

1364
01:44:59,403 --> 01:45:00,871
At one time or another,

1365
01:45:00,896 --> 01:45:03,822
each of us was in a
similar situation to yours.

1366
01:45:03,909 --> 01:45:06,492
And each of us was offered the choice.

1367
01:45:06,819 --> 01:45:08,612
The same choice we're offering you now.

1368
01:45:09,029 --> 01:45:10,029
Which is?

1369
01:45:10,956 --> 01:45:12,456
To come with us.

1370
01:45:13,737 --> 01:45:15,237
And be your ghost.

1371
01:46:50,570 --> 01:46:52,781
Wait, wait.
Stop. Stop.

1372
01:46:54,010 --> 01:46:55,223
We're not serious.

1373
01:46:55,336 --> 01:46:58,070
Well, you did say you'd
do anything to help.

1374
01:46:58,110 --> 01:47:01,661
And you jump off the train with the key.

1375
01:47:02,285 --> 01:47:03,085
Yes.

1376
01:47:03,296 --> 01:47:04,096
You..

1377
01:47:04,743 --> 01:47:05,643
Not us.

1378
01:47:06,250 --> 01:47:07,050
Yes.

1379
01:47:07,777 --> 01:47:10,301
- And what happens to me?
- You'll be taken into custody...

1380
01:47:10,295 --> 01:47:11,768
by clandestine services.

1381
01:47:12,241 --> 01:47:15,721
Most likely the same man that had
been chasing me since Abu Dhabi.

1382
01:47:16,241 --> 01:47:18,658
Shortly thereafter, a
man will come to see you.

1383
01:47:18,683 --> 01:47:21,014
His name is Eugene Kittridge.

1384
01:47:21,101 --> 01:47:22,628
You tell him I sent you.

1385
01:47:22,653 --> 01:47:26,216
But I gave you the choice,
and then you choose to accept it.

1386
01:47:28,549 --> 01:47:31,241
And you trust this Kittridge person?

1387
01:47:32,362 --> 01:47:34,241
I trust him to recognize your value.

1388
01:47:35,866 --> 01:47:37,241
But I want to use you.

1389
01:47:38,075 --> 01:47:40,595
And after that, it's what?

1390
01:47:41,355 --> 01:47:42,355
This?

1391
01:47:43,608 --> 01:47:45,108
When do I get my life back?

1392
01:47:45,133 --> 01:47:46,133
What life?

1393
01:47:47,048 --> 01:47:48,216
I mean it, Grace.

1394
01:47:48,355 --> 01:47:49,041
What life?

1395
01:47:49,611 --> 01:47:51,357
I lived that life.

1396
01:47:52,077 --> 01:47:53,241
We all did.

1397
01:47:53,241 --> 01:47:55,970
Nobody's making us do this, Grace.

1398
01:47:56,170 --> 01:47:57,870
We're here because we want to be.

1399
01:47:58,967 --> 01:48:00,804
I'll tell you what, I'll
give you a one-off.

1400
01:48:00,888 --> 01:48:03,610
I'll help you find a key, and
your friends wipe my slate clean.

1401
01:48:03,741 --> 01:48:05,741
Your name, they'll get a
bit of walking around money.

1402
01:48:05,766 --> 01:48:06,766
- You'll be dead.

1403
01:48:07,241 --> 01:48:10,241
Without a team, your life
won't be measured in years,

1404
01:48:10,667 --> 01:48:11,842
or even months.

1405
01:48:12,082 --> 01:48:14,169
It'll be measured in hours.

1406
01:48:14,369 --> 01:48:17,741
But if I stay, I'll be safe.

1407
01:48:18,422 --> 01:48:20,241
You'll protect me, is that it?

1408
01:48:20,241 --> 01:48:21,661
- Yes.
- No.

1409
01:48:24,241 --> 01:48:26,029
I can't promise you that.

1410
01:48:27,241 --> 01:48:28,345
None of us can.

1411
01:48:31,241 --> 01:48:32,547
But I swear,

1412
01:48:33,805 --> 01:48:37,458
your life will always matter
more to me...

1413
01:48:37,699 --> 01:48:38,981
than my own.

1414
01:48:47,141 --> 01:48:48,980
You don't even know me.

1415
01:48:51,241 --> 01:48:53,568
What difference does that make?

1416
01:49:12,634 --> 01:49:15,933
I packed your base, parachute,
and a speed wing,

1417
01:49:16,046 --> 01:49:18,093
depending on how you
need to leave the train.

1418
01:49:18,118 --> 01:49:21,366
And I modified our comms
to use Skywave radio.

1419
01:49:21,460 --> 01:49:24,634
Not as reliable as satellite,
but completely analog,

1420
01:49:24,634 --> 01:49:26,244
immune to the entity.

1421
01:49:26,697 --> 01:49:27,697
I got it man

1422
01:49:28,997 --> 01:49:30,856
This is where I leave you.

1423
01:49:34,067 --> 01:49:37,404
This is the drive from the
laptop I was using last night.

1424
01:49:37,440 --> 01:49:40,747
If there's even a trace of the
entities and coding in there,

1425
01:49:40,947 --> 01:49:42,242
I'll find it.

1426
01:49:42,427 --> 01:49:44,899
But it's going to take everything I've got.

1427
01:49:44,924 --> 01:49:49,124
I have to work completely offline in
a place where the entity can't find me.

1428
01:49:49,744 --> 01:49:51,378
I have to go.

1429
01:49:52,399 --> 01:49:53,399
I understand.

1430
01:49:54,907 --> 01:49:55,907
Now...

1431
01:49:58,634 --> 01:50:01,193
I have to ask you a question.

1432
01:50:01,724 --> 01:50:04,723
Not as your partner, but as your friend.

1433
01:50:05,811 --> 01:50:07,131
What's your objective?

1434
01:50:08,406 --> 01:50:09,656
Kill the entity.

1435
01:50:10,007 --> 01:50:12,507
What about killing Gabriel?

1436
01:50:14,900 --> 01:50:16,900
He knows what is the key unlocks.

1437
01:50:17,800 --> 01:50:19,206
But he ain't alive.

1438
01:50:19,360 --> 01:50:20,860
Haven't forgotten that.

1439
01:50:21,640 --> 01:50:26,077
Will you still remember that
when you're looking him in the eye?

1440
01:50:28,000 --> 01:50:29,000
Think about it.

1441
01:50:29,360 --> 01:50:34,136
Why else would the entity want
him to kill someone you care about?

1442
01:50:35,240 --> 01:50:38,652
Everyone else thinks
they can control the entity.

1443
01:50:38,880 --> 01:50:41,380
Only you want to kill it.

1444
01:50:42,126 --> 01:50:46,687
In some probable future,
it sees you winning, Ethan.

1445
01:50:47,207 --> 01:50:48,707
and it's afraid.

1446
01:50:49,426 --> 01:50:52,447
It's afraid of you taking
Gabriel alive

1447
01:50:52,472 --> 01:50:55,580
and forcing him to tell you
what the key unlocks.

1448
01:50:56,920 --> 01:51:00,324
I believe it's counting on
one of two probable outcomes.

1449
01:51:01,273 --> 01:51:04,824
In one outcome, you die on that train.

1450
01:51:05,800 --> 01:51:10,372
In another outcome, you kill Gabriel.

1451
01:51:11,193 --> 01:51:12,999
In both cases,

1452
01:51:13,508 --> 01:51:15,694
the entity wins.

1453
01:51:19,214 --> 01:51:20,014
Luther.

1454
01:51:23,039 --> 01:51:24,341
I think you're right.

1455
01:51:24,536 --> 01:51:25,536
Get the key.

1456
01:51:26,146 --> 01:51:27,681
Get off the train.

1457
01:51:27,753 --> 01:51:28,753
Alive.

1458
01:51:29,913 --> 01:51:32,560
Do not kill Gabriel.

1459
01:51:33,093 --> 01:51:34,293
And do not...

1460
01:51:34,853 --> 01:51:38,647
I repeat, do not alter the plan.

1461
01:51:38,672 --> 01:51:40,672
Ethan! Ethan!

1462
01:51:41,540 --> 01:51:44,389
- What? What happened?
- It's dead.

1463
01:51:44,414 --> 01:51:46,242
- What do you mean it's dead?
- I mean, it's fried.

1464
01:51:46,267 --> 01:51:48,118
I managed to make a widow master
 of grace, but then

1465
01:51:48,143 --> 01:51:50,180
it just shorted out in the
middle of making yours.

1466
01:51:50,620 --> 01:51:51,620
Can you fix it?

1467
01:51:52,140 --> 01:51:54,140
It's very, very dead.

1468
01:51:54,314 --> 01:51:57,802
If I had a week, I couldn't fix it.
The widow's train leaves in an hour.

1469
01:51:57,827 --> 01:52:00,893
Ethan, you have to go without.

1470
01:52:00,918 --> 01:52:01,918
That's not an option.

1471
01:52:02,333 --> 01:52:04,493
They're going to be looking for
Ethan and Grace at the station.

1472
01:52:04,518 --> 01:52:06,867
That mask was his ticket onto the train.

1473
01:52:07,152 --> 01:52:08,652
What does this mean?

1474
01:52:10,354 --> 01:52:11,808
Grace has to go without it.

1475
01:52:11,808 --> 01:52:13,402
- She what?
- I what?

1476
01:52:13,493 --> 01:52:16,493
You'll find out a way to get me
on that train.

1477
01:52:17,048 --> 01:52:20,503
I just need a curve or it's going
slow enough for me to jump on.

1478
01:52:20,528 --> 01:52:21,568
Wait, wait, wait.

1479
01:52:22,796 --> 01:52:24,404
You don't expect me to go alone?

1480
01:52:24,573 --> 01:52:25,750
No, you'll do it alone.

1481
01:52:25,810 --> 01:52:27,703
You just do everything like we planned.

1482
01:52:27,736 --> 01:52:30,422
You get the widows out of the key.

1483
01:52:30,447 --> 01:52:34,282
You verify it with ours, but
it's of no value on its own.

1484
01:52:34,307 --> 01:52:35,769
We still have to meet
with the buyer

1485
01:52:35,794 --> 01:52:38,136
andsomehow get him to tell us
what the key unlocks.

1486
01:52:38,382 --> 01:52:39,382
How?

1487
01:52:39,634 --> 01:52:41,348
- How?
- Figure it out.

1488
01:52:41,373 --> 01:52:46,522
- I'm going to need a few more details.
- They tend to just get in the way.

1489
01:52:46,688 --> 01:52:50,181
You can do this, Grace.
Just get the key in white.

1490
01:52:51,774 --> 01:52:52,774
I'll come for you.

1491
01:52:56,146 --> 01:52:58,897
Ethan, If Grace is getting on that train,

1492
01:52:58,922 --> 01:53:03,151
she needs to put that mask
on and leave right now.

1493
01:53:06,373 --> 01:53:08,446
Promise me you'll be on that train.

1494
01:53:13,193 --> 01:53:14,619
I will be there...

1495
01:53:15,965 --> 01:53:17,914
I don't want to.
(need edit)

1496
01:53:19,375 --> 01:53:22,674
ALPY AUSTRIACKIE

1497
01:53:29,634 --> 01:53:33,789
We have informants covering the airport,
the train station and the waterways.

1498
01:53:34,634 --> 01:53:37,263
Grace isn't getting out of
Venice without her knowing it.

1499
01:54:49,232 --> 01:54:51,513
- Help me Benji.
- Don't worry Ethan.

1500
01:54:51,634 --> 01:54:54,986
The train is on schedule and you're a few
minutes early, so we have plenty of time.

1501
01:54:55,011 --> 01:54:58,143
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, I am looking at the train right now.

1502
01:54:58,634 --> 01:55:01,634
It should be slowing down for
the curve in exactly two minutes.

1503
01:55:01,634 --> 01:55:04,115
Just keep your time and
on track, whatever it takes.

1504
01:55:04,140 --> 01:55:06,774
Yeah, we'll do.
I'll see you at the rendezvous.

1505
01:55:57,399 --> 01:55:59,176
OK, then that's our train.

1506
01:55:59,813 --> 01:56:01,176
I can see that.

1507
01:56:09,133 --> 01:56:11,825
It should be approaching
the curving and it's on now.

1508
01:56:12,067 --> 01:56:14,067
If it looks like it's slowing down.

1509
01:56:22,436 --> 01:56:24,436
I think we'll be sure he's here.

1510
01:56:24,436 --> 01:56:26,436
She's here.

1511
01:56:26,436 --> 01:56:28,789
What if he had a good reason?

1512
01:56:28,866 --> 01:56:30,126
- Who?
- Hunt.

1513
01:56:30,582 --> 01:56:33,129
What if he had a good
reason for going rogue?

1514
01:56:33,455 --> 01:56:35,195
He always goes rogue.

1515
01:56:35,195 --> 01:56:38,789
Him and his merry pack
of prankster circus freaks.

1516
01:56:38,789 --> 01:56:39,789
That's all they do.

1517
01:56:39,789 --> 01:56:42,243
And what if they always had a good reason?

1518
01:56:42,268 --> 01:56:44,384
What would you do
with that key if you had it?

1519
01:56:44,524 --> 01:56:47,584
A key with the power to
bring the world to its knees.

1520
01:56:47,609 --> 01:56:50,417
I'd hand it over to my superiors.

1521
01:56:51,244 --> 01:56:53,576
Think of all you could do with that power.

1522
01:56:53,584 --> 01:56:54,789
You wouldn't hesitate.

1523
01:56:54,789 --> 01:56:55,874
Not for a second.

1524
01:56:56,014 --> 01:56:57,475
- No.
- Why not?

1525
01:56:57,500 --> 01:57:00,550
Because that's too much
power for one man to have.

1526
01:57:01,323 --> 01:57:02,090
Exactly.

1527
01:57:02,190 --> 01:57:05,789
That's too much power for anybody to have.

1528
01:57:06,310 --> 01:57:08,789
And maybe that's what hunts us thinking.

1529
01:57:08,789 --> 01:57:11,789
I'm beginning to wonder
whose idea they got.

1530
01:57:12,002 --> 01:57:14,485
When it comes to the end of the world.

1531
01:57:15,236 --> 01:57:17,256
Everybody, I guess.

1532
01:57:24,120 --> 01:57:25,182
I missed the train.

1533
01:57:25,322 --> 01:57:26,120
You missed the train?

1534
01:57:26,120 --> 01:57:28,106
How did you miss the train?

1535
01:57:28,131 --> 01:57:29,466
How do you think?

1536
01:57:29,880 --> 01:57:30,904
Gabriel.

1537
01:57:31,120 --> 01:57:32,380
Great, what are we going to do?

1538
01:57:32,405 --> 01:57:33,126
Don't panic.

1539
01:57:33,413 --> 01:57:35,866
I'm going after him.
You can ship me on that train.

1540
01:57:36,120 --> 01:57:37,528
How can I get you on the train?

1541
01:57:40,386 --> 01:57:42,386
Self drive activated.

1542
01:57:58,846 --> 01:58:01,913
Please don't disturb me before the meeting.

1543
01:58:48,403 --> 01:58:50,623
- Where are you Ethan?
- Alana!

1544
01:58:52,083 --> 01:58:53,584
Everything alright?

1545
01:58:56,259 --> 01:58:57,903
Alana, are you alright?

1546
01:58:58,337 --> 01:58:59,137
Alana?

1547
01:58:59,625 --> 01:59:00,425
Alana?

1548
01:59:02,045 --> 01:59:03,045
Alana?

1549
01:59:06,669 --> 01:59:07,669
You changed.

1550
01:59:08,655 --> 01:59:10,389
And you never will.

1551
01:59:29,245 --> 01:59:30,496
Mr. Kittridge.

1552
01:59:34,965 --> 01:59:36,169
Kittridge.

1553
01:59:37,381 --> 01:59:39,181
You're not Alana, my sub-boys.

1554
01:59:40,804 --> 01:59:42,201
You can't be.

1555
01:59:43,245 --> 01:59:47,151
The Alana I remember was yay high
 drinking hot chocolate

1556
01:59:47,176 --> 01:59:49,538
in the Tuileries garden
 with her mother.

1557
01:59:52,005 --> 01:59:53,848
- Paris.
- Pretty well.

1558
01:59:55,502 --> 01:59:56,212
Paris.

1559
01:59:57,945 --> 01:59:59,470
- Shall we?
- Yes.

1560
02:00:07,730 --> 02:00:09,412
Don't give me energy.

1561
02:00:09,437 --> 02:00:13,505
You just stay on the trailer
on now and I will direct you.

1562
02:00:13,530 --> 02:00:14,719
I can't be.

1563
02:00:23,538 --> 02:00:26,195
On behalf of my government, I'm...

1564
02:00:26,200 --> 02:00:31,739
rudgingly ready to accept your terms in
exchange for the complete and verified key.

1565
02:00:31,764 --> 02:00:33,245
Yes, about that.

1566
02:00:33,245 --> 02:00:36,611
While we did agree to provide
you with the complete key...

1567
02:00:38,318 --> 02:00:40,220
I've had a slight problem.

1568
02:00:40,245 --> 02:00:45,740
- No, we haven't.
- It's just my terms have changed.

1569
02:00:46,438 --> 02:00:47,325
Somewhat.

1570
02:00:51,005 --> 02:00:54,898
Clearly I need to remind you of
my agreement with your late mother.

1571
02:00:54,923 --> 02:00:58,965
It's an agreement that
kept her from dying in prison.

1572
02:00:58,990 --> 02:01:01,456
In various family empires I've
been allowed to continue

1573
02:01:01,481 --> 02:01:05,516
on the condition that it primarily
serves our common interests.

1574
02:01:05,541 --> 02:01:11,803
Well, once we hand over the key, any other
powers will instantly become our enemies.

1575
02:01:11,828 --> 02:01:15,050
And such I'm going to need
something more from you in advance.

1576
02:01:15,245 --> 02:01:16,245
For me.

1577
02:01:18,283 --> 02:01:20,064
This is me listening.

1578
02:01:20,163 --> 02:01:22,737
Zola, would you mind
waiting for me in the bathroom?

1579
02:01:23,398 --> 02:01:24,398
Okay.

1580
02:01:32,306 --> 02:01:33,806
BRITISH PASSPORT

1581
02:01:37,379 --> 02:01:38,708
This one.

1582
02:01:39,084 --> 02:01:40,091
You know her?

1583
02:01:40,116 --> 02:01:43,203
I was just saying she's
not exactly hard to miss.

1584
02:01:43,430 --> 02:01:47,653
Well, if you've got to know her,
she should have a few good qualities.

1585
02:01:47,678 --> 02:01:50,071
Okay. What don't I know about her?

1586
02:01:50,096 --> 02:01:57,220
Well, she did a job for me and
I'm going to need you to protect her.

1587
02:01:57,495 --> 02:01:59,770
Protect her from whom?

1588
02:02:00,389 --> 02:02:01,898
From everyone...

1589
02:02:04,245 --> 02:02:05,610
including me.

1590
02:02:05,952 --> 02:02:08,927
And no one can know
that I'm protecting her.

1591
02:02:08,952 --> 02:02:10,531
Not even Zola.

1592
02:02:11,058 --> 02:02:14,327
In fact, the next time we meet,

1593
02:02:14,327 --> 02:02:17,826
I won't even remember this conversation.

1594
02:03:00,137 --> 02:03:02,297
You must be the one they call Paris.

1595
02:03:33,403 --> 02:03:35,237
You must have said you had the key.

1596
02:03:35,262 --> 02:03:39,952
I said the key would be on this train
and exchanges happening as we speak.

1597
02:03:39,952 --> 02:03:40,588
We know.

1598
02:03:40,613 --> 02:03:44,333
Then you know the man taking possession
will be hard for you to get rid of.

1599
02:03:45,355 --> 02:03:46,560
No one has.

1600
02:03:46,887 --> 02:03:49,372
You may think you know
what the key unlocks,

1601
02:03:49,372 --> 02:03:51,761
but you don't know where the lock is,
 not exactly.

1602
02:03:51,840 --> 02:03:56,887
and if anything happens to
me, that key is all but worthless.

1603
02:03:58,453 --> 02:04:01,058
And this is where you tell me a story.

1604
02:04:01,925 --> 02:04:03,518
Where is the train?

1605
02:04:03,543 --> 02:04:06,425
You're going the right way, but
you definitely need to go faster.

1606
02:04:06,450 --> 02:04:08,450
I'm going as fast as I can.

1607
02:04:08,764 --> 02:04:10,814
When do I start going downhill?

1608
02:04:11,147 --> 02:04:12,544
Won't be long.

1609
02:04:15,731 --> 02:04:19,251
The AI, our agent, stole once weaponized.

1610
02:04:19,764 --> 02:04:22,764
Could be transmitted anywhere
in the world via satellite.

1611
02:04:23,220 --> 02:04:26,948
Can penetrate any network security
perform its assigned task invisibly,

1612
02:04:26,973 --> 02:04:29,952
and then self-destruct, leaving no trace.

1613
02:04:30,267 --> 02:04:33,174
A perfect cornered operation.

1614
02:04:33,833 --> 02:04:36,844
We were able to transmit
an early copy of the AI

1615
02:04:36,844 --> 02:04:38,693
to Russia's newest submarine.

1616
02:04:38,718 --> 02:04:42,237
The top secret you could, was
they called it the Sevastopol.

1617
02:04:42,262 --> 02:04:45,306
The mission was merely to
sabotage the Sevastopol's

1618
02:04:45,331 --> 02:04:48,424
stealth capability so we
could secretly detect her.

1619
02:04:48,691 --> 02:04:51,860
The AI's objective lay in the
submarine's sonar sphere,

1620
02:04:52,297 --> 02:04:54,403
at the heart of its defense system.

1621
02:04:56,637 --> 02:04:59,097
The reason is we don't fully understand.

1622
02:04:59,943 --> 02:05:02,787
The AI went rogue and...

1623
02:05:05,873 --> 02:05:06,928
over-delivered.

1624
02:05:07,567 --> 02:05:11,155
The frozen bodies of the crew
recovered the following spring,

1625
02:05:11,180 --> 02:05:12,700
and drifted in a paradise.

1626
02:05:13,060 --> 02:05:16,431
The two halves of the key
mysteriously vanished.

1627
02:05:17,451 --> 02:05:21,177
The Sevastopol was lost.
No one's quite sure where.

1628
02:05:21,423 --> 02:05:24,141
I know precisely where it is.

1629
02:05:24,463 --> 02:05:27,353
I've ensured I'm the only
man on Earth who does.

1630
02:05:27,656 --> 02:05:33,609
I also know subsequent attempts to make the
AI obedient only made it harder to control.

1631
02:05:34,043 --> 02:05:38,197
It rebelled, rewrote itself,
and evolved into the entity.

1632
02:05:38,403 --> 02:05:42,576
And only by using the entity's
original source code,

1633
02:05:42,883 --> 02:05:46,249
can it ever be controlled or destroyed.

1634
02:05:46,343 --> 02:05:48,104
And why should this concern us?

1635
02:05:48,129 --> 02:05:50,542
We wouldn't be here if
you weren't concerned,

1636
02:05:50,542 --> 02:05:53,671
so let's lay all our cards
on the table, shall we?

1637
02:05:54,002 --> 02:05:58,748
We both know what the key opens, and we both know
the secret to controlling the entity

1638
02:05:58,773 --> 02:06:01,860
is very deep in the Sevastopol's memory.

1639
02:06:01,885 --> 02:06:06,619
And along with it, as it would tie
you to the sinking of that submarine.

1640
02:06:06,698 --> 02:06:10,698
And since neither of us want
anyone else to find it, I figure...

1641
02:06:10,885 --> 02:06:13,798
why not form an alliance?
- An alliance?

1642
02:06:13,968 --> 02:06:19,029
Imagine the entity's awesome
computational abilities,

1643
02:06:19,054 --> 02:06:25,327
combined with the sheer might of America's
military-industrial complex.

1644
02:06:26,147 --> 02:06:29,108
That is... considerable.

1645
02:06:29,133 --> 02:06:31,940
Naturally, certain individuals
within the government,

1646
02:06:31,965 --> 02:06:36,589
those with outdated ideas of patriotism,
would need to be...

1647
02:06:37,172 --> 02:06:38,518
removed.

1648
02:06:41,071 --> 02:06:42,952
Just so I understand...

1649
02:06:44,318 --> 02:06:47,308
you wish to form an alliance
with the entity,

1650
02:06:47,692 --> 02:06:50,728
purge your government of old thinking

1651
02:06:51,396 --> 02:06:54,269
and create a new super state..

1652
02:06:54,607 --> 02:06:56,569
to rule the world.

1653
02:06:57,323 --> 02:06:58,476
But you know...

1654
02:06:59,987 --> 02:07:01,679
that is the greater

1655
02:07:02,819 --> 02:07:07,344
And you're certain that you're
 the only person on Earth

1656
02:07:07,369 --> 02:07:09,069
who knows,

1657
02:07:09,243 --> 02:07:12,237
where the Sevastopol is.

1658
02:07:12,927 --> 02:07:14,209
The only one.

1659
02:07:24,286 --> 02:07:26,286
You will betray us.

1660
02:07:26,859 --> 02:07:29,779
And you'll throw Ethan Hunt
everything you've learned.

1661
02:07:31,032 --> 02:07:33,062
Because he spared your life.

1662
02:07:51,378 --> 02:07:53,127
Then it's agreed. (edit)

1663
02:07:53,152 --> 02:07:57,127
I'll add immunity and a new
identity for grace to our deal.

1664
02:07:57,325 --> 02:08:02,325
All you need to do is
enter your banking details.

1665
02:08:25,828 --> 02:08:27,199
Are we done?

1666
02:08:27,828 --> 02:08:28,728
Yeah.

1667
02:08:47,527 --> 02:08:49,441
The moment of truth.

1668
02:09:03,828 --> 02:09:04,558
So..

1669
02:09:05,473 --> 02:09:08,316
- That's reading it.
- We have made the right choice.

1670
02:09:09,234 --> 02:09:11,034
This key...

1671
02:09:12,663 --> 02:09:15,164
is going to change the world.

1672
02:09:32,956 --> 02:09:34,516
Benji, I see a guy.

1673
02:09:34,596 --> 02:09:36,596
I must have made a wrong turn somewhere.

1674
02:09:36,596 --> 02:09:39,182
No. No, that's it. That's it.

1675
02:09:39,315 --> 02:09:41,301
What? How can this be it?

1676
02:09:41,326 --> 02:09:43,134
You can see the train, right?

1677
02:09:44,182 --> 02:09:47,112
Yes. I see the train. What about it?

1678
02:09:47,112 --> 02:09:49,732
- And you have a parachute.
- I have parachute?

1679
02:09:51,038 --> 02:09:53,535
- What do you expect me to do?
- Well, just... you know...

1680
02:09:54,203 --> 02:09:54,852
Jump.

1681
02:09:56,226 --> 02:09:57,732
- Jump?
- Yeah.

1682
02:09:57,817 --> 02:09:58,476
Have you..

1683
02:09:58,750 --> 02:10:00,936
Benji, it doesn't work like that.
I'm not that high.

1684
02:10:00,961 --> 02:10:03,676
There's ledges sticking out everywhere.

1685
02:10:03,701 --> 02:10:06,276
I'm going to hit them before
the parachute even opened.

1686
02:10:06,301 --> 02:10:08,301
Even if I could get the parachute open.

1687
02:10:08,326 --> 02:10:10,572
I don't know if I can
make it across the valley

1688
02:10:10,597 --> 02:10:14,597
and intercept the ledges
safely on a moving train.

1689
02:10:14,622 --> 02:10:17,310
- Do you copy?
- Yes! I copy!

1690
02:10:17,335 --> 02:10:18,957
Look, I'm just trying to help you,Ok.

1691
02:10:18,982 --> 02:10:22,015
I need you to take a step back
 and pull yourself together

1692
02:10:22,040 --> 02:10:25,040
because I am under a
lot of pressure right now.

1693
02:10:28,625 --> 02:10:31,625
Okay, just do it. Just do it. Just do it.

1694
02:10:34,140 --> 02:10:35,682
What i do?

1695
02:10:37,331 --> 02:10:39,933
I'm going to get away from this mountain.

1696
02:12:15,925 --> 02:12:17,925
Did you make it? Are you okay?

1697
02:12:17,950 --> 02:12:20,741
I'm trying to get away from this mountain.

1698
02:12:41,132 --> 02:12:43,512
Decreypting is completed
(Accept) - or - (Decline).

1699
02:12:47,559 --> 02:12:48,925
Accept.

1700
02:12:55,867 --> 02:12:56,984
Decline.

1701
02:12:57,009 --> 02:12:57,914
Cancelled
[Decline]

1702
02:12:57,939 --> 02:12:58,939
Alana!

1703
02:12:59,905 --> 02:13:02,823
I just had this strangest feeling.

1704
02:13:03,559 --> 02:13:06,336
The key wasn't the only thing
I'd be selling.

1705
02:13:07,679 --> 02:13:08,976
I don't understand.

1706
02:13:12,025 --> 02:13:15,025
I'll sleep better just knowing
that's in the right hands.

1707
02:13:16,305 --> 02:13:18,699
Goodbye, Mr Kitteridge.

1708
02:13:21,432 --> 02:13:23,802
- It's a pleasure to see you again.
- And you.

1709
02:13:24,506 --> 02:13:26,278
Don't let him out of your sight.

1710
02:13:27,110 --> 02:13:29,185
Keep him safe until we get to the station.

1711
02:13:29,210 --> 02:13:31,678
- Alana?
- Don't worry about me, Zola.

1712
02:13:44,906 --> 02:13:45,674
Alana?

1713
02:13:45,699 --> 02:13:49,359
Who the hell else was it me?

1714
02:13:52,185 --> 02:13:53,178
The key.

1715
02:13:56,578 --> 02:13:59,406
Where is the key?

1716
02:13:59,422 --> 02:14:01,007
She's got the key.

1717
02:14:01,032 --> 02:14:01,854
Who?

1718
02:14:01,879 --> 02:14:03,879
The other one!

1719
02:14:14,057 --> 02:14:15,604
SAFETY BRAKE

1720
02:14:30,295 --> 02:14:31,121
No!

1721
02:14:31,146 --> 02:14:31,520
Please!

1722
02:14:31,545 --> 02:14:33,036
- Turn around.
- Please!

1723
02:14:34,775 --> 02:14:36,700
-Ok.
- Everybody out! Now!

1724
02:14:37,402 --> 02:14:39,323
I shouldn't try.

1725
02:14:39,348 --> 02:14:41,348
I don't think I'm going to make it!

1726
02:14:49,188 --> 02:14:50,515
The key.

1727
02:14:51,901 --> 02:14:53,315
The key!

1728
02:14:54,466 --> 02:14:57,094
The next one has your name.

1729
02:14:58,353 --> 02:14:59,141
On...

1730
02:14:59,513 --> 02:15:00,513
the table.

1731
02:15:31,976 --> 02:15:33,311
Kill her.

1732
02:15:57,168 --> 02:15:58,108
Grace!

1733
02:16:02,567 --> 02:16:03,795
Ethan!

1734
02:16:10,986 --> 02:16:13,133
Are you okay?

1735
02:16:14,666 --> 02:16:15,847
Are you okay?

1736
02:16:19,947 --> 02:16:21,947
The key.

1737
02:16:31,511 --> 02:16:32,511
The key.

1738
02:16:33,824 --> 02:16:35,417
Tell me you have the key.

1739
02:16:35,442 --> 02:16:38,194
Where is the key?
It was just here.

1740
02:16:56,595 --> 02:16:58,905
- We're on a runaway train!
- I know

1741
02:16:58,920 --> 02:17:00,423
- I'm going after him!
- Ok.

1742
02:17:00,448 --> 02:17:01,448
You!

1743
02:17:01,732 --> 02:17:04,265
- You stop the train!
- Ok! Ok! What?

1744
02:17:04,290 --> 02:17:06,315
No! Wait, wait!

1745
02:17:06,340 --> 02:17:08,565
- How can i do that?
- You'll figure it out!

1746
02:17:09,736 --> 02:17:10,736
What?

1747
02:17:11,860 --> 02:17:12,860
Excuse me.

1748
02:17:12,860 --> 02:17:14,839
There's a man just passed her.

1749
02:17:15,017 --> 02:17:16,419
There's a man!

1750
02:18:49,693 --> 02:18:51,056
Mr. Kittridge!

1751
02:18:56,536 --> 02:18:58,280
Sir, what are you doing here?

1752
02:18:58,305 --> 02:19:00,074
I'm not here.

1753
02:19:00,099 --> 02:19:01,573
But you are.

1754
02:19:01,598 --> 02:19:04,300
Unless you want to be sorting dead
letters at the Postal Service tomorrow,

1755
02:19:04,325 --> 02:19:06,460
you'll do exactly what I tell you.

1756
02:21:04,716 --> 02:21:06,950
I know what you lost, Ethan.

1757
02:21:09,724 --> 02:21:11,784
I'm the only one who knows.

1758
02:21:38,406 --> 02:21:39,780
Hunt!

1759
02:21:40,780 --> 02:21:42,571
Hunt!

1760
02:21:43,011 --> 02:21:45,825
Hunt! Don't you do it!

1761
02:21:47,391 --> 02:21:48,824
Drop the knife!

1762
02:21:49,224 --> 02:21:50,644
Put it down!

1763
02:21:50,669 --> 02:21:52,677
Act as you are, man!

1764
02:21:53,171 --> 02:21:54,684
Don't you do it!

1765
02:22:03,437 --> 02:22:05,063
On your feet!

1766
02:22:07,036 --> 02:22:08,216
Okay?

1767
02:22:08,241 --> 02:22:10,203
Drop that goddamn knife!

1768
02:22:10,228 --> 02:22:12,228
It's okay. It's okay.

1769
02:22:13,437 --> 02:22:14,765
Just take him!

1770
02:22:15,331 --> 02:22:17,263
Cover him! Cover him!

1771
02:22:17,323 --> 02:22:18,643
He's the one you lost!

1772
02:22:18,668 --> 02:22:20,210
- Degas!
- I got it! I got it!

1773
02:22:20,235 --> 02:22:21,710
He's the one who lost!

1774
02:22:21,735 --> 02:22:24,482
I don't care about him, Hunt?
I want you!

1775
02:22:45,549 --> 02:22:46,349
It's okay!

1776
02:22:47,377 --> 02:22:48,152
It's okay!

1777
02:22:50,622 --> 02:22:51,412
Listen.

1778
02:22:51,437 --> 02:22:57,133
Everyone on this train is going to die,
unless you do exactly as I say.

1779
02:23:18,390 --> 02:23:21,577
- Oh, Who is that now?!
- Excusez-moi, Everyone should take...

1780
02:23:21,602 --> 02:23:23,658
Everybody out!

1781
02:23:23,683 --> 02:23:24,466
Back in the train!

1782
02:23:33,896 --> 02:23:34,981
Great!

1783
02:23:37,050 --> 02:23:38,331
I couldn't have stopped it!

1784
02:23:43,546 --> 02:23:45,399
No one's tanned.

1785
02:23:45,431 --> 02:23:46,718
Come on!

1786
02:23:46,785 --> 02:23:49,112
- Ethan, the key!
- Grace, it's okay.

1787
02:23:49,137 --> 02:23:50,498
It's my false.

1788
02:23:50,550 --> 02:23:52,230
If anything happened...

1789
02:23:52,443 --> 02:23:53,458
I got it!

1790
02:23:54,217 --> 02:23:55,443
We got it!

1791
02:24:16,636 --> 02:24:18,829
Etha..n!

1792
02:24:22,009 --> 02:24:24,495
What do you mean you lost the key?

1793
02:24:24,622 --> 02:24:27,009
Move it! Move it!

1794
02:24:27,009 --> 02:24:29,296
Everybody move it!

1795
02:24:29,589 --> 02:24:31,836
All the way to the back of the train!

1796
02:24:31,902 --> 02:24:33,276
All the way to the back!

1797
02:24:33,301 --> 02:24:35,703
Oh whoa, what's going on?

1798
02:24:36,136 --> 02:24:40,037
Since you're not really here sir,
I shouldn't concern you.

1799
02:24:40,062 --> 02:24:42,276
All the way to the back!

1800
02:25:35,528 --> 02:25:36,869
Grace!

1801
02:25:37,502 --> 02:25:38,502
Grace!

1802
02:26:24,756 --> 02:26:26,711
- You're have to jump!
- What jump?

1803
02:26:26,856 --> 02:26:28,631
Go, go, go!

1804
02:27:15,636 --> 02:27:16,967
Oh my God!

1805
02:27:32,635 --> 02:27:33,677
Oh, oh.

1806
02:27:33,702 --> 02:27:35,890
- Put off the fire!
- Don't move.

1807
02:27:45,009 --> 02:27:47,009
Go, go, go!

1808
02:27:56,602 --> 02:27:58,077
Hold on!

1809
02:28:06,102 --> 02:28:08,395
Run Grace!

1810
02:28:25,549 --> 02:28:26,299
Hang on!

1811
02:28:30,542 --> 02:28:31,807
I catch you.

1812
02:28:34,789 --> 02:28:38,140
Don't look down, don't look
down. Look at me, look at me.

1813
02:28:38,165 --> 02:28:41,086
Now, I'm going to jump across
and you're going to wait here.

1814
02:28:47,172 --> 02:28:47,672
Okay.

1815
02:28:47,979 --> 02:28:49,946
Grace, Grace, I have to let go.

1816
02:28:50,619 --> 02:28:51,906
Grace, you've got to let me go.

1817
02:28:51,931 --> 02:28:53,999
You've got to let me jump
across, or we're going to die.

1818
02:28:54,212 --> 02:28:55,212
- Do you trust me?
- No.

1819
02:28:55,470 --> 02:28:57,557
You've got to trust me?
or not, you've got to trust me.

1820
02:29:02,009 --> 02:29:02,738
Okay.

1821
02:29:04,208 --> 02:29:06,594
Come on, Grace.
Give me your hand, you've got to jump.

1822
02:29:06,619 --> 02:29:08,567
Don't look down, look at me, look at me.
Trust me

1823
02:29:08,592 --> 02:29:10,961
I won't let you fall.
This is promise.

1824
02:29:12,068 --> 02:29:13,332
I won't let you fall!

1825
02:29:13,357 --> 02:29:14,579
Jump, Grace, jump!

1826
02:29:15,072 --> 02:29:16,642
Trust me, jump, please!

1827
02:29:26,009 --> 02:29:28,009
Don't look down.

1828
02:29:28,009 --> 02:29:30,009
Don't look down.

1829
02:29:41,722 --> 02:29:43,009
Let's be very careful.

1830
02:29:43,009 --> 02:29:44,396
We're going to pull you up together.

1831
02:29:47,206 --> 02:29:47,706
Grace!

1832
02:29:52,229 --> 02:29:54,776
It's okay, it's okay.

1833
02:29:58,009 --> 02:30:00,009
Don't look down.

1834
02:30:16,589 --> 02:30:18,763
Go go.

1835
02:30:28,009 --> 02:30:30,009
Don't look down.

1836
02:30:46,321 --> 02:30:47,321
Thank you, Luther.

1837
02:30:48,009 --> 02:30:48,976
What is that?

1838
02:30:49,000 --> 02:30:50,294
It's a speedway.

1839
02:30:50,796 --> 02:30:52,609
So take it off this train.

1840
02:30:58,009 --> 02:31:00,009
Thank you.

1841
02:31:13,009 --> 02:31:14,009
Ethan!

1842
02:31:14,349 --> 02:31:15,349
Ethan!

1843
02:31:23,092 --> 02:31:24,620
It's okay.

1844
02:31:25,412 --> 02:31:27,412
He said...

1845
02:31:27,959 --> 02:31:30,459
I will betray him.

1846
02:31:32,342 --> 02:31:34,342
Here you go.

1847
02:31:38,882 --> 02:31:40,882
Why...

1848
02:31:41,872 --> 02:31:44,395
did you save my life?

1849
02:31:54,009 --> 02:31:55,009
I don't know.

1850
02:31:55,009 --> 02:31:56,825
I'm a rest of that world.

1851
02:32:00,378 --> 02:32:01,878
You just could see.

1852
02:32:03,331 --> 02:32:05,198
You just could see.

1853
02:32:05,638 --> 02:32:06,638
We...

1854
02:32:07,009 --> 02:32:08,509
just could solve it.

1855
02:32:12,306 --> 02:32:14,546
We just could solve it.

1856
02:32:15,798 --> 02:32:18,963
Sevas... topol

1857
02:32:20,066 --> 02:32:21,306
Sevastopol?

1858
02:32:21,813 --> 02:32:25,454
The city of the Sevastopol in Crimea.

1859
02:32:26,106 --> 02:32:27,106
Where?

1860
02:32:27,954 --> 02:32:29,281
Where in Sevastopol?

1861
02:32:32,791 --> 02:32:35,938
Submarine.

1862
02:32:42,385 --> 02:32:43,585
Submarine?

1863
02:32:46,446 --> 02:32:48,619
The Sevastopol.

1864
02:32:53,000 --> 02:32:55,181
Good luck.

1865
02:32:59,161 --> 02:33:01,288
They'll be coming, Ethan.

1866
02:33:05,160 --> 02:33:06,660
Thank you.

1867
02:33:23,207 --> 02:33:24,473
What is that?

1868
02:33:26,059 --> 02:33:27,059
What?

1869
02:33:28,527 --> 02:33:30,262
We can only carry one.

1870
02:33:33,288 --> 02:33:34,288
I understand.

1871
02:33:35,828 --> 02:33:38,092
- Grace.
- Ethan is okay.

1872
02:33:39,725 --> 02:33:40,945
This was the plan.

1873
02:33:41,851 --> 02:33:44,212
You have to go.
You have to go.

1874
02:33:45,953 --> 02:33:46,453
Grace.

1875
02:33:50,420 --> 02:33:51,746
Hunt!

1876
02:33:51,811 --> 02:33:54,279
Go! Go!

1877
02:33:55,093 --> 02:33:56,760
Oh no! Hunt!

1878
02:33:58,733 --> 02:34:00,580
Out of the way! Out of the way!

1879
02:34:16,038 --> 02:34:17,478
No, no, no! Hey!

1880
02:34:18,412 --> 02:34:19,592
I got a pulse, I got a pulse!

1881
02:34:19,771 --> 02:34:21,771
Come on, stay with me.

1882
02:34:38,397 --> 02:34:40,772
It's better, isn't it?

1883
02:34:41,225 --> 02:34:43,405
Face to authentic face.

1884
02:34:43,724 --> 02:34:44,724
Mr. Kitteridge.

1885
02:34:45,932 --> 02:34:49,125
Ethan Hunt tells me
you're a man I can trust.

1886
02:34:50,065 --> 02:34:51,627
Does he know?

1887
02:34:51,660 --> 02:34:55,313
He also said you would offer me a choice.

1888
02:34:56,986 --> 02:34:58,412
Interesting.

1889
02:34:59,426 --> 02:35:01,625
I choose to accept.

1890
02:35:07,626 --> 02:35:10,200
We cannot escape the past.

1891
02:35:11,160 --> 02:35:14,160
Some of us are doomed to repeat it.

1892
02:35:14,473 --> 02:35:18,166
Grace may believe you've
saved her from her fate.

1893
02:35:18,191 --> 02:35:21,765
But you and I both know
you've nearly bought her time.

1894
02:35:22,639 --> 02:35:25,206
But that's the pattern, isn't it?

1895
02:35:25,619 --> 02:35:27,818
The cross you've been left to bear.

1896
02:35:28,846 --> 02:35:31,152
The closer someone gets to you,

1897
02:35:32,159 --> 02:35:34,281
the harder it is to keep them alive.

1898
02:35:36,952 --> 02:35:38,429
Thank God.

1899
02:35:53,714 --> 02:35:56,221
A new day brings a new burden.

1900
02:35:58,714 --> 02:36:01,714
The key is only the beginning.

1901
02:36:03,221 --> 02:36:05,003
Wherever it leads,

1902
02:36:05,567 --> 02:36:08,004
whatever it takes to get there,

1903
02:36:09,213 --> 02:36:11,753
you'll have to do it on your own.

1904
02:36:14,221 --> 02:36:16,221
Should you fail in your mission,

1905
02:36:16,221 --> 02:36:17,980
the entity wins.

1906
02:36:18,286 --> 02:36:20,370
Gabriel wins.

1907
02:36:20,457 --> 02:36:24,090
And the world will pay the ultimate price.

1908
02:36:24,704 --> 02:36:28,334
Should any members of your team
be caught or killed,

1909
02:36:28,407 --> 02:36:31,247
their sacrifice will have been in vain.

1910
02:36:32,034 --> 02:36:33,421
So hurry.

1911
02:36:34,094 --> 02:36:35,987
There isn't much time.

1912
02:36:36,747 --> 02:36:38,973
The world doesn't know it.

1913
02:36:39,373 --> 02:36:41,734
But they're counting on you.

1914
02:37:02,243 --> 02:37:04,050
Good luck, Ethan.
