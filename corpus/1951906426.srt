00:00:25,625 --> 00:00:26,649
Hi, you've reached Noah and Clare.

2
00:00:26,726 --> 00:00:28,250
Leave a message at the-

3
00:00:28,495 --> 00:00:29,826
Hi, it's Mom.

4
00:00:29,896 --> 00:00:31,363
I hope I'm not bothering you.

5
00:00:31,531 --> 00:00:32,998
Happy Halloween.

6
00:00:33,099 --> 00:00:36,330
You probably work now so you can
just call me when you get home.

7
00:00:36,403 --> 00:00:38,963
I mean you actually don't
have to call me and tell,

8
00:00:39,072 --> 00:00:40,801
you know it's obviously
not important,

9
00:00:40,874 --> 00:00:43,138
But if you want to call me,
please feel free to.

10
00:00:43,209 --> 00:00:45,336
I just wanted to ask you... Shit...

11
00:00:45,412 --> 00:00:47,403
I can't remember why I called now.

12
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:51,918
Anyway, I'm sleeping so much
better with this new prescription

13
00:00:51,953 --> 00:00:54,721
and my jaw only clicks now
when I yawn or chew.

14
00:00:54,756 --> 00:00:55,881
And I, You know what.

15
00:00:55,955 --> 00:00:57,320
I remember why I called now.

16
00:00:57,424 --> 00:01:00,791
Do you have my VCR manual in...

17
00:01:00,860 --> 00:01:03,260
Hang on a second.
My toast just popped.

18
00:01:08,835 --> 00:01:10,632
Hold on, Sammi.

19
00:01:11,137 --> 00:01:13,002
Who's on the phone now?

20
00:01:13,139 --> 00:01:14,265
What's that, uh?!

21
00:01:14,374 --> 00:01:15,534
Who's on the phone?!

22
00:01:15,608 --> 00:01:16,141
What do you mean?

23
00:01:16,176 --> 00:01:17,302
Somebody's on the phone?!

24
00:01:17,377 --> 00:01:22,747
Hello? Hello? There's nobody
on the phone, Gene.

25
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:27,251
I think your mom's messages
are kidding shorter.

26
00:01:29,222 --> 00:01:31,952
You know how people worry about
their mothers dying?

27
00:01:32,358 --> 00:01:35,122
I worry mine's gonna live forever.

28
00:03:25,071 --> 00:03:27,631
There must be another
exercise I can do...

29
00:03:27,941 --> 00:03:30,009
Who's the physical therapist,
Bob, you or me?

30
00:03:30,044 --> 00:03:30,475
You...

31
00:03:30,643 --> 00:03:32,210
All right! Keep those knees up!

32
00:03:32,245 --> 00:03:35,009
We'll see some high step in!
Work that ACL!

33
00:03:35,081 --> 00:03:36,981
Noah, your mom's on line one.

34
00:03:37,083 --> 00:03:38,380
Tell her I'm busy, would you?

35
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:39,851
Doing great, Bob.

36
00:03:39,886 --> 00:03:41,386
You look like an antelope here.

37
00:03:41,421 --> 00:03:43,955
Cooper, I need you
in my office. Now

38
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:46,550
Technically, Dana, it's
your dad's office, not yours.

39
00:03:46,626 --> 00:03:48,924
Yeah? That's what he thinks.

40
00:03:49,095 --> 00:03:50,687
Today, Cooper.

41
00:03:51,331 --> 00:03:52,457
That's good, Bob.

42
00:03:52,532 --> 00:03:53,829
Take a rest.

43
00:03:54,467 --> 00:03:56,162
Thank god...

44
00:03:58,571 --> 00:03:59,902
Dad, I have Cooper here.

45
00:03:59,973 --> 00:04:00,672
We need to take your ticket,

46
00:04:00,707 --> 00:04:02,275
then I have me
first class on the website.

47
00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:02,969
Didn't I tell you five

48
00:04:03,042 --> 00:04:05,408
Dana! What time are we doing
the Cooper thing?

49
00:04:05,478 --> 00:04:06,276
He's here now.

50
00:04:06,311 --> 00:04:07,074
Put him on.

51
00:04:07,146 --> 00:04:07,942
He is.

52
00:04:08,047 --> 00:04:08,846
Hello, Ralph.

53
00:04:08,881 --> 00:04:10,048
All right, no small talk.

54
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:13,314
I've asked Dana to meet with you
to discuss the mission you have. Dana.

55
00:04:13,419 --> 00:04:16,189
We've been watching you as
Head PT now for several months,

56
00:04:16,224 --> 00:04:17,486
and it's become increasingly clear

57
00:04:17,657 --> 00:04:19,716
that you're not
meeting company standards.

58
00:04:19,792 --> 00:04:21,282
Show personae case of number.

59
00:04:21,928 --> 00:04:24,829
These are the billing guidelines
that have been established for you.

60
00:04:24,897 --> 00:04:27,661
And these are the actual totals
that you've billed out.

61
00:04:27,734 --> 00:04:29,500
Quite a discrepancy,
wouldn't you say?

62
00:04:29,535 --> 00:04:32,538
Oh, I would say these goals are
completely unrealistic.

63
00:04:32,573 --> 00:04:33,472
You're the boss now.

64
00:04:33,507 --> 00:04:34,371
I didn't get the memo.

65
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:35,998
Look, I told you before, Ralph,

66
00:04:36,075 --> 00:04:37,977
I'm not going to over
bill patients for you.

67
00:04:38,012 --> 00:04:38,909
It's unethical.

68
00:04:38,978 --> 00:04:40,502
Are you calling me a fraud?

69
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:42,275
The bottom line is this.

70
00:04:42,348 --> 00:04:44,373
We've given you plenty of chances

71
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:47,044
to get with the program
and you failed.

72
00:04:47,153 --> 00:04:48,381
I'm sorry to say this,
but-Actually, I'm not-

73
00:04:48,488 --> 00:04:50,012
We're gonna have to let you go.

74
00:04:50,089 --> 00:04:51,249
You're firing me?

75
00:04:51,324 --> 00:04:53,121
You're just one germen, genius

76
00:04:53,326 --> 00:04:55,089
It's not a reflection of you
as a person.

77
00:04:55,161 --> 00:04:57,391
How is that not a reflect on me
as a person?

78
00:04:57,563 --> 00:04:59,895
Have your testicles
even descended yet?

79
00:04:59,966 --> 00:05:01,593
Did he just say testicles?

80
00:05:01,768 --> 00:05:03,395
I built this office for you!

81
00:05:03,503 --> 00:05:06,495
Every doctor that refers patients
to us is because of me!

82
00:05:06,606 --> 00:05:08,972
Every supplier connection
is because of me!

83
00:05:09,075 --> 00:05:10,839
Christ, I hit the bang winning home run

84
00:05:10,874 --> 00:05:12,604
against Silverman's
Orthopedic All-Stars

85
00:05:12,679 --> 00:05:14,145
and won a championship for you!

86
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:15,704
Only because I got
a two-out hit in the ninth

87
00:05:15,782 --> 00:05:17,113
and kept the inning alive!

88
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:19,413
Yeah, I guess the shortstop
had a prosthetic leg!

89
00:05:19,485 --> 00:05:20,653
You hit it to his weak side!

90
00:05:20,688 --> 00:05:21,585
That's no pride.

91
00:05:21,654 --> 00:05:22,552
Go to hell, Cooper!

92
00:05:22,622 --> 00:05:24,647
I never want to see you
in my office again.

93
00:05:24,857 --> 00:05:25,619
Dana, call security.

94
00:05:25,725 --> 00:05:27,056
Gladly.

95
00:05:28,061 --> 00:05:28,891
Calm Down.

96
00:05:28,961 --> 00:05:29,742
What's that noise?

97
00:05:29,777 --> 00:05:30,523
Are you all right?

98
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:32,359
Don't let him take the spin!

99
00:05:33,099 --> 00:05:37,126
But the wise little Alice was
not going to do that in a hurry.

100
00:05:37,303 --> 00:05:39,863
"No, I'll look first," she said,

101
00:05:40,006 --> 00:05:42,406
for she had read several
nice little stories

102
00:05:42,508 --> 00:05:44,669
about children who had got burnt,

103
00:05:44,844 --> 00:05:49,144
and eaten up by wild beasts,
and other unpleasant things,

104
00:05:51,951 --> 00:05:55,284
Sorry guys. Sorry! Sit tight! OK?

105
00:05:57,657 --> 00:05:59,022
Mrs. Cooper's class.

106
00:05:59,092 --> 00:06:01,185
Hello, Mrs. Cooper, it's me.

107
00:06:01,761 --> 00:06:02,455
Hi me.

108
00:06:02,562 --> 00:06:05,656
So I have some good news
and somebad news.

109
00:06:05,798 --> 00:06:06,765
What happened?

110
00:06:06,866 --> 00:06:09,096
The bad news is I got fired.

111
00:06:09,335 --> 00:06:11,394
But the good news is I'm gonna
start my own practice

112
00:06:11,471 --> 00:06:13,063
two years ahead of schedule.

113
00:06:13,139 --> 00:06:14,401
Ralph fired you?

114
00:06:14,474 --> 00:06:16,203
No, Dana did.

115
00:06:16,309 --> 00:06:17,936
Ralph was on speakerphone.

116
00:06:18,010 --> 00:06:18,676
Oh my God!

117
00:06:18,711 --> 00:06:19,939
What an asshole.

118
00:06:20,613 --> 00:06:21,910
Look, honey, I'm really sorry,

119
00:06:21,981 --> 00:06:23,608
but I'm in the middle of class
right now.

120
00:06:23,683 --> 00:06:24,809
Can we talk it later?

121
00:06:24,884 --> 00:06:27,218
Yeah, try not to get fired, OK?

122
00:06:27,253 --> 00:06:29,312
One of us should have a job,
I think.

123
00:06:29,722 --> 00:06:30,689
Happy Halloween.

124
00:06:30,757 --> 00:06:32,224
Goodbye.

125
00:06:54,647 --> 00:06:56,615
Oh, how's it going?

126
00:06:56,916 --> 00:06:58,110
Pretty good.

127
00:06:58,184 --> 00:07:00,778
Great. Who are you?

128
00:07:01,921 --> 00:07:02,910
Myron Stubbs.

129
00:07:02,989 --> 00:07:06,982
You know I'm Clare's cousin
from Indianapolis?

130
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:08,424
She said I could stay
here a few days

131
00:07:08,494 --> 00:07:10,860
for this writing seminar
I'm going to.

132
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:12,063
Oh, right.

133
00:07:12,098 --> 00:07:13,656
I thought
that was a couple of weeks.

134
00:07:13,766 --> 00:07:15,165
Yeah, it got moved up.

135
00:07:15,234 --> 00:07:18,404
So I called her from the airport
to find out where the spare key was.

136
00:07:18,439 --> 00:07:19,962
I never would've guessed.

137
00:07:20,306 --> 00:07:21,204
I'm Noah.

138
00:07:21,474 --> 00:07:22,964
Nice to finally meet you.

139
00:07:23,075 --> 00:07:24,372
Nice to meet you.

140
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:25,911
Can I ask you a question?

141
00:07:26,078 --> 00:07:28,911
Is that my toothbrush next
to your toenail clippings?

142
00:07:29,215 --> 00:07:31,945
Is it? Oh man, I'm sorry.

143
00:07:32,285 --> 00:07:33,411
I forgot mine at home.

144
00:07:33,486 --> 00:07:37,422
So I just Yeah, it's a simple mistake.

145
00:07:37,523 --> 00:07:37,887
You know what.

146
00:07:37,957 --> 00:07:38,889
I'll just go buy one.

147
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:40,789
That's okay.

148
00:07:41,127 --> 00:07:41,718
You know what.

149
00:07:41,828 --> 00:07:44,592
Keep it and think it as
a Welcome to our Home gift.

150
00:07:44,664 --> 00:07:46,723
Really? Right on.

151
00:07:47,133 --> 00:07:48,327
Thanks.

152
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:57,302
Trick or treat!

153
00:07:57,410 --> 00:07:58,206
Who is this?

154
00:07:58,311 --> 00:07:59,300
Oh, look at these.

155
00:07:59,512 --> 00:08:01,275
Straight from Villa Villekulla.

156
00:08:01,347 --> 00:08:04,510
How excited Happy Halloween.

157
00:08:05,418 --> 00:08:06,942
There's my unemployed man.

158
00:08:07,119 --> 00:08:07,483
Hi.

159
00:08:07,553 --> 00:08:08,713
Does my cousin get here okay?

160
00:08:08,788 --> 00:08:09,755
Yeah, he went out for a while.

161
00:08:10,122 --> 00:08:11,783
He said He'd be back
in a minute.

162
00:08:12,291 --> 00:08:14,122
So are you serious about
what you said

163
00:08:14,193 --> 00:08:15,922
about starting
your own practice right now?

164
00:08:16,229 --> 00:08:18,754
Yeah. I mean what have
I got to lose, right?

165
00:08:18,865 --> 00:08:22,961
I've got experience, I'm clearly
executive management material.

166
00:08:23,236 --> 00:08:24,669
So, what do you think?

167
00:08:24,871 --> 00:08:26,566
Can we go to the Honesty Zone?

168
00:08:26,739 --> 00:08:27,933
I would love to.

169
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:30,235
I've always thought you'd be
great running your own practice,

170
00:08:30,309 --> 00:08:31,003
you know that.

171
00:08:31,077 --> 00:08:33,477
But you haven't had
the most stable job history.

172
00:08:33,546 --> 00:08:35,446
This is a lot responsibility.

173
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:37,380
Wow, I haven't thought that.

174
00:08:37,483 --> 00:08:38,677
Thank you.

175
00:08:39,485 --> 00:08:40,645
Maybe that's
because you were too busy

176
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:44,212
trying to avoid accountability
by making a joke of everything.

177
00:08:44,757 --> 00:08:46,657
Does it feel like
the HonestyZone's not quite

178
00:08:46,726 --> 00:08:48,717
as constructive as it used to be?

179
00:08:48,794 --> 00:08:51,024
You know, look,
I support you no matter what.

180
00:08:51,163 --> 00:08:53,597
I just want you to be sure
this is the right time.

181
00:08:53,699 --> 00:08:56,065
I think I can really do
something great with this.

182
00:08:56,135 --> 00:08:58,070
And it'll only take a few months
to get started,

183
00:08:58,105 --> 00:09:00,538
so in the meantime, honey,

184
00:09:00,673 --> 00:09:04,277
I can call Donnie to get my
old job back so we don't starve.

185
00:09:04,312 --> 00:09:04,709
Ewww, Donnie?

186
00:09:04,777 --> 00:09:05,300
Are you sure?

187
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:07,676
He said I could come back
if I wanted to,

188
00:09:07,747 --> 00:09:11,547
the hours are flexible and
the pay's not terrible.

189
00:09:12,451 --> 00:09:15,477
Okay, and that's the plan.

190
00:09:15,655 --> 00:09:17,145
I like you.

191
00:09:22,028 --> 00:09:23,256
Trick or treat!

192
00:09:23,496 --> 00:09:24,588
Mom?

193
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:28,158
Marilyn, what's the matter?

194
00:09:28,234 --> 00:09:30,099
I'm fine, I...

195
00:09:31,671 --> 00:09:35,573
You know I'm probably happy,
I don't wanna bother you.

196
00:09:36,175 --> 00:09:37,699
Hey, where's Dad?

197
00:09:37,777 --> 00:09:39,608
Oh, him. He's at home.

198
00:09:39,779 --> 00:09:43,681
We had a really big fight
but Don't worry about me

199
00:09:43,749 --> 00:09:45,273
because I'm absolutely fine.

200
00:09:45,351 --> 00:09:46,909
I'm just going to a motel room.

201
00:09:46,986 --> 00:09:47,611
I'll find one.

202
00:09:47,687 --> 00:09:49,382
Maybe you should stay here tonight.

203
00:09:49,455 --> 00:09:52,322
Or come in for some coffee and
we'll call around for vacancies

204
00:09:52,425 --> 00:09:54,825
And somehow the night's... No...

205
00:09:55,061 --> 00:09:57,597
I don't really want to
intrude you, darling.

206
00:09:57,632 --> 00:10:00,164
I just stopped
by to say hello to you.

207
00:10:00,199 --> 00:10:03,069
Just sort of to give you
the thumps up of everything.

208
00:10:03,104 --> 00:10:04,093
You know what I'm saying.

209
00:10:04,370 --> 00:10:06,531
It's no big deal and come on in
and use the phone.

210
00:10:06,639 --> 00:10:07,731
Check hotel for vacancies.

211
00:10:07,807 --> 00:10:10,742
We're not taking no for an answer,
You're staying with us tonight.

212
00:10:10,977 --> 00:10:12,808
That's so sweet.

213
00:10:13,346 --> 00:10:16,042
Alright, Hartanto, we can stay!

214
00:10:17,116 --> 00:10:18,947
Go Sammi.

215
00:10:19,051 --> 00:10:21,144
Go. Out of the car.

216
00:10:22,355 --> 00:10:23,947
Sammi

217
00:10:24,256 --> 00:10:26,451
Oh... Great... Great...

218
00:10:26,525 --> 00:10:26,957
Where is...

219
00:10:27,026 --> 00:10:27,640
Oh, don't worry.

220
00:10:27,675 --> 00:10:28,254
We will gather

221
00:10:28,327 --> 00:10:31,922
You are such a sweet and
little blessing, Hartanto.

222
00:10:31,998 --> 00:10:33,966
It's Hoo Nong Yo, not Hartanto.

223
00:10:34,033 --> 00:10:34,499
That's OK.

224
00:10:34,567 --> 00:10:35,266
Don't worry about it.

225
00:10:35,301 --> 00:10:36,268
Just place them everywhere.

226
00:10:36,303 --> 00:10:36,962
But be careful that.

227
00:10:37,036 --> 00:10:37,764
That's glass one.

228
00:10:37,837 --> 00:10:38,604
Be careful though.

229
00:10:38,639 --> 00:10:39,372
Don't worry. It's OK.

230
00:10:39,407 --> 00:10:39,963
It's fine.

231
00:10:40,039 --> 00:10:41,097
I'll come back with other ones.

232
00:10:41,207 --> 00:10:41,969
This guy is not too smart.

233
00:10:42,041 --> 00:10:43,372
I realize you only brought
the essentials.

234
00:10:43,442 --> 00:10:44,101
I think. That's good.

235
00:10:44,210 --> 00:10:44,676
Yeah, I know.

236
00:10:44,744 --> 00:10:48,346
Honey, what are you supposed to be,
a French vampire?

237
00:10:48,381 --> 00:10:51,373
Check it out, your neighbor's
giving away King Size Snickers.

238
00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:51,882
Hello.

239
00:10:51,951 --> 00:10:54,249
Hi, Clare! My goodness.

240
00:10:54,353 --> 00:10:55,285
It's really happy to see you.

241
00:10:55,388 --> 00:10:58,118
Anyway, I'm feeling
a little cooped up.

242
00:10:58,190 --> 00:10:59,025
Is anyone hungry?

243
00:10:59,060 --> 00:11:00,287
My treat.

244
00:11:04,096 --> 00:11:05,620
When was the last time
you washed your hair?

245
00:11:05,698 --> 00:11:06,630
It looks kind of greasy.

246
00:11:06,699 --> 00:11:08,326
I think it's
your diabetic retinopathy.

247
00:11:08,434 --> 00:11:10,095
To be honest.

248
00:11:10,202 --> 00:11:11,032
Oh.

249
00:11:11,103 --> 00:11:12,263
It's not greasy.

250
00:11:12,371 --> 00:11:14,931
Look, how succulent
everything looks.

251
00:11:15,007 --> 00:11:16,307
OK, sweetie, I'll take that.

252
00:11:16,342 --> 00:11:17,607
Yes, egg salad is for me.

253
00:11:17,877 --> 00:11:22,780
And this one right here
had the cheese sandwich on.

254
00:11:22,848 --> 00:11:23,212
Yeah let her

255
00:11:23,282 --> 00:11:26,376
And this big guy
had the Spanish Omelet.

256
00:11:26,452 --> 00:11:27,248
I think she knows.

257
00:11:27,319 --> 00:11:28,308
She took the order.

258
00:11:28,387 --> 00:11:29,183
Can I ask you?

259
00:11:29,255 --> 00:11:32,383
Do you know if the cheese
on the omelet has reduced fat?

260
00:11:32,525 --> 00:11:33,492
I don't know.

261
00:11:33,592 --> 00:11:34,524
Can you please check?

262
00:11:34,593 --> 00:11:36,220
Because you see
we have high cholesterol

263
00:11:36,295 --> 00:11:38,263
and diabetes in our family.

264
00:11:38,330 --> 00:11:39,763
Sure. Can I get you anything else?

265
00:11:39,832 --> 00:11:43,825
I'm a diabetic and sometimes
diabetics have very large babies.

266
00:11:43,936 --> 00:11:45,767
My son was ten pounds.

267
00:11:45,871 --> 00:11:46,565
Oh My God!

268
00:11:46,639 --> 00:11:48,630
No, we're great, thank you.

269
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:51,609
And I'm sorry you have to
hear the miracle of this.

270
00:11:51,744 --> 00:11:52,267
And mine...

271
00:11:52,344 --> 00:11:53,504
O.K.

272
00:11:55,514 --> 00:11:56,213
Is it just me?

273
00:11:56,248 --> 00:11:59,615
Or did she seem like
she was high on marijuana?

274
00:12:00,252 --> 00:12:02,277
You can tell me what's going
on with you and dad?

275
00:12:02,354 --> 00:12:03,956
Can you please pass the salt,
Myrelle?

276
00:12:03,991 --> 00:12:05,041
Thank you.

277
00:12:05,076 --> 00:12:06,084
It's Myron.

278
00:12:06,119 --> 00:12:07,058
Oh. Myron.

279
00:12:07,093 --> 00:12:10,460
Actually I kind of
like Myrelle better.

280
00:12:10,930 --> 00:12:13,125
It reminds me of
Gone With the Wind.

281
00:12:13,232 --> 00:12:15,632
Normally black movies
don't hold my attention,

282
00:12:15,701 --> 00:12:18,864
but I liked that one.
And I like The Jeffersons.

283
00:12:19,238 --> 00:12:22,639
Honey, how is your omelet?

284
00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:23,970
I haven't tasted it yet.

285
00:12:24,076 --> 00:12:25,407
Can I have a little bite?

286
00:12:25,478 --> 00:12:26,740
You know just a smidge.

287
00:12:26,812 --> 00:12:28,279
Yeah, you can tell me how it tastes.

288
00:12:28,347 --> 00:12:29,371
Honey, Can I have a bite.

289
00:12:29,515 --> 00:12:30,709
All crazy.

290
00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:32,677
Oh, get a big bite.

291
00:12:33,419 --> 00:12:34,317
Do you like it?

292
00:12:34,386 --> 00:12:35,216
Do you like my omelet?

293
00:12:35,287 --> 00:12:35,519
Actually...

294
00:12:35,554 --> 00:12:36,680
Should I have gotten ham?

295
00:12:37,022 --> 00:12:40,116
Oh, that's succulent.

296
00:12:40,192 --> 00:12:42,854
So are you going to tell me
what's going on with you and dad

297
00:12:42,928 --> 00:12:43,826
No?

298
00:12:43,896 --> 00:12:45,227
How was school today, Clare?

299
00:12:45,297 --> 00:12:46,059
It's great.

300
00:12:46,165 --> 00:12:47,962
We have a costume
competition today.

301
00:12:48,033 --> 00:12:48,931
There's a runoff

302
00:12:49,001 --> 00:12:50,992
between Freddy Kreuger
and a Crayon.

303
00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:52,196
Freddy Kreuger won.

304
00:12:52,438 --> 00:12:54,065
OK. You know what.

305
00:12:54,373 --> 00:12:55,169
There you go.

306
00:12:55,274 --> 00:12:56,741
Thank you, honey.

307
00:12:57,143 --> 00:12:57,802
You are so nice.

308
00:12:58,811 --> 00:13:01,405
Myron, what do you do for living?

309
00:13:01,714 --> 00:13:03,011
I'm a screenwriter.

310
00:13:03,082 --> 00:13:05,016
No! That is so interesting.

311
00:13:05,317 --> 00:13:08,081
I'm working on
a horror Sci-fi project

312
00:13:08,354 --> 00:13:11,585
set in the jungles of
Vietnam. Lt. Tom Dawson

313
00:13:11,657 --> 00:13:15,058
gets infected by Agent
Orange-infected malaria,

314
00:13:15,494 --> 00:13:17,094
then mutates into
a descent violent

315
00:13:17,129 --> 00:13:19,620
but misunderstood
creature driven to insanity

316
00:13:19,732 --> 00:13:21,825
by the horrors of
herbicidal warfare.

317
00:13:21,901 --> 00:13:23,167
That's unreal.

318
00:13:23,202 --> 00:13:26,000
My original title was Mansquito,
but that's already been taken

319
00:13:26,071 --> 00:13:26,696
Oh Yeah!

320
00:13:26,772 --> 00:13:29,673
So my working title is PTSD,

321
00:13:29,809 --> 00:13:33,711
which is Post Traumatic Stress
Disorder or Destroyer.

322
00:13:33,813 --> 00:13:34,711
That's provoking.

323
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:35,804
It's presuming

324
00:13:35,881 --> 00:13:37,143
You know the Fly.

325
00:13:37,783 --> 00:13:38,545
Excellent!

326
00:13:38,651 --> 00:13:42,610
Sounds like it'll really capture
the authentic Vietnam experience.

327
00:13:42,688 --> 00:13:44,986
But with a sci-fi hook, exactly.

328
00:13:45,691 --> 00:13:48,660
Half Commando... Half Mosquito...

329
00:13:48,928 --> 00:13:50,657
Total Terror.

330
00:13:51,197 --> 00:13:54,189
My God! That sounds so exciting.

331
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:54,965
Sounds Great.

332
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,228
I really like to read it.

333
00:13:56,302 --> 00:13:57,860
How much do you get paid?

334
00:13:58,838 --> 00:14:00,669
Well, I don't get paid
until I sell it.

335
00:14:00,739 --> 00:14:03,833
But I did send a query letter to
William Morrison to see

336
00:14:03,909 --> 00:14:05,706
if they want it for Snipes.

337
00:14:09,448 --> 00:14:11,006
Wesley Snipes?

338
00:14:13,219 --> 00:14:13,810
Wow!

339
00:14:13,886 --> 00:14:15,877
Isn't that one of your favorite
black actors?

340
00:14:17,623 --> 00:14:19,420
I don't wanna talk about.

341
00:14:20,392 --> 00:14:21,324
How is everything?

342
00:14:21,393 --> 00:14:22,519
Oh succulent.

343
00:14:22,595 --> 00:14:23,857
Isn't it, everyone?

344
00:14:23,963 --> 00:14:24,395
Oh, hey

345
00:14:24,463 --> 00:14:25,657
Do you like movies?

346
00:14:25,831 --> 00:14:27,025
I love them

347
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:27,631
Oh my god

348
00:14:27,666 --> 00:14:30,191
You should tell her your idea,
Myron.

349
00:14:30,970 --> 00:14:35,703
Lt. Tom Dawson gets infected by
Agent Orange-infected malaria

350
00:14:39,511 --> 00:14:41,911
Oh, come on.

351
00:14:41,981 --> 00:14:42,970
Oh my god.

352
00:14:43,048 --> 00:14:44,675
Clare, I'm so sorry.

353
00:14:45,618 --> 00:14:47,643
That does Bad!

354
00:14:48,153 --> 00:14:48,847
Hello?

355
00:14:48,954 --> 00:14:50,046
Is your mother there?

356
00:14:50,122 --> 00:14:50,918
That I'm warning you,

357
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:53,151
you might be kicked
anger Never mind,

358
00:14:53,292 --> 00:14:55,260
I hear my answer
shitting on your floor.

359
00:14:55,361 --> 00:14:56,293
OK. What's going on?

360
00:14:56,328 --> 00:14:57,317
She said you got in a fight,

361
00:14:57,463 --> 00:14:58,896
but every time I asked for
the answers.

362
00:14:58,964 --> 00:14:59,692
She ignores me.

363
00:14:59,765 --> 00:15:00,789
How should I know?

364
00:15:00,933 --> 00:15:02,560
We're handing out
candy one minute

365
00:15:02,635 --> 00:15:05,468
and the next she's yelling at me
in that ridiculous pumpkin suit.

366
00:15:05,537 --> 00:15:06,834
What did you do?

367
00:15:07,072 --> 00:15:08,369
Just put her on the phone.

368
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:09,236
Mom

369
00:15:09,341 --> 00:15:11,832
No, I am not getting him
on the phone.

370
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:13,037
She doesn't want to talk.

371
00:15:13,112 --> 00:15:14,101
That's a first.

372
00:15:14,246 --> 00:15:15,577
Who is it, Gene?

373
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:16,780
Is it her?

374
00:15:16,815 --> 00:15:19,750
No, it's your unemployed
grandson.

375
00:15:19,885 --> 00:15:21,580
What's that have to do
with anything?

376
00:15:21,687 --> 00:15:22,984
I'm just stating the facts.

377
00:15:23,188 --> 00:15:24,985
I guess not everyone's
lucky enough

378
00:15:25,057 --> 00:15:26,718
to work at the post office
their whole lives.

379
00:15:26,792 --> 00:15:28,259
It's not luck when you earn it.

380
00:15:28,327 --> 00:15:29,225
Look, whatever.

381
00:15:29,295 --> 00:15:30,421
She's staying here tonight.

382
00:15:30,496 --> 00:15:31,758
You guys can talk tomorrow.

383
00:15:31,830 --> 00:15:32,797
Don't bet on it!

384
00:15:34,266 --> 00:15:35,597
She just fell, didn't she?

385
00:15:35,668 --> 00:15:36,760
Yep.

386
00:15:38,504 --> 00:15:40,306
I hope I'm not
putting you out, Myron?

387
00:15:40,341 --> 00:15:41,702
No. I'll be fine on the couch.

388
00:15:41,737 --> 00:15:43,063
Spit it put, Sammy Higgins.

389
00:15:43,142 --> 00:15:45,076
Spit it out and we'll see.

390
00:15:45,210 --> 00:15:47,269
So all these guys
have the same name?

391
00:15:47,813 --> 00:15:49,804
They're part of
my home dog rescue.

392
00:15:49,882 --> 00:15:52,248
I have average about forty a year,

393
00:15:52,318 --> 00:15:54,343
and that's why I call
everyone Sammy Higgins.

394
00:15:54,453 --> 00:15:56,216
It's easy to remember
and it helps me

395
00:15:56,288 --> 00:15:59,257
keep a detached professionalism
when they get adopted.

396
00:15:59,591 --> 00:16:00,523
Right on.

397
00:16:00,859 --> 00:16:02,451
Well, I hope you feel better.

398
00:16:02,628 --> 00:16:03,329
I'll see you in the morning.

399
00:16:03,364 --> 00:16:03,943
I guess.

400
00:16:03,978 --> 00:16:04,523
Wonderful.

401
00:16:04,596 --> 00:16:06,928
Good luck at that
writing seminar tomorrow!

402
00:16:06,999 --> 00:16:07,433
Thanks!

403
00:16:07,468 --> 00:16:07,899
OK

404
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:08,866
Bye. Myron

405
00:16:08,901 --> 00:16:10,368
Myrilan, Is this yours?

406
00:16:10,436 --> 00:16:12,267
It was just laying on
the living room floor.

407
00:16:12,338 --> 00:16:13,270
Thank you so much.

408
00:16:13,339 --> 00:16:15,034
It must have fallen down of my bag.

409
00:16:15,407 --> 00:16:17,408
What the hell is that thing?

410
00:16:17,443 --> 00:16:19,410
It's just a lighter, Relax.

411
00:16:20,012 --> 00:16:20,910
Do you know what I do?

412
00:16:21,013 --> 00:16:23,914
I used it to scare people like you
if you sneak up on me.

413
00:16:24,016 --> 00:16:26,109
Wouldn't it be safer
just carrying some mace?

414
00:16:26,185 --> 00:16:27,017
I tried that once,

415
00:16:27,052 --> 00:16:29,452
but I ended upmistaking it
for my Binaca.

416
00:16:29,555 --> 00:16:29,919
Come here.

417
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:30,580
No, I'm going to sleep.

418
00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:31,645
You're going to sleep?

419
00:16:31,757 --> 00:16:32,849
Oh, I'll see you tomorrow morning.

420
00:16:32,958 --> 00:16:35,119
Please tell me
if everything you want.

421
00:16:35,761 --> 00:16:37,820
Call me if you want this turkey.

422
00:16:39,365 --> 00:16:41,299
Gosh, you know what's funny?

423
00:16:42,034 --> 00:16:43,729
Yes. I do.

424
00:16:43,836 --> 00:16:45,929
What's funny is my head's
still throbbing,

425
00:16:46,038 --> 00:16:47,562
but the fall snapped
my shoulder back into place.

426
00:16:47,639 --> 00:16:49,072
I got to to remember to
tell my Pain Pals

427
00:16:49,141 --> 00:16:50,039
about that right now.

428
00:16:50,109 --> 00:16:51,440
Yeah, Mom,
maybe you should go to bed

429
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:52,807
because it's getting late.

430
00:16:52,878 --> 00:16:53,776
And it's been a long day.

431
00:16:53,879 --> 00:16:54,868
You want to play Scrabble?

432
00:16:54,947 --> 00:16:56,005
I brought my dictionary.

433
00:16:56,115 --> 00:16:56,513
Oh, no.

434
00:16:56,548 --> 00:16:57,708
But maybe tomorrow.

435
00:16:58,017 --> 00:17:00,008
Okay,

436
00:17:00,119 --> 00:17:00,813
OK. Good night.

437
00:17:00,886 --> 00:17:06,620
Noah, hug me as hard as you can
and show me how much you love me.

438
00:17:10,195 --> 00:17:11,161
Harder.

439
00:17:11,196 --> 00:17:14,165
I don't want to disarrange
that shoulders because...

440
00:17:15,334 --> 00:17:16,562
Nice to meet you.

441
00:17:17,069 --> 00:17:18,093
Noah?

442
00:17:18,604 --> 00:17:19,628
Yeah?

443
00:17:20,839 --> 00:17:23,364
You forget to say good night
to Sammy Higgins.

444
00:17:25,010 --> 00:17:28,002
Good night, Sammy Higgins... es.

445
00:17:29,248 --> 00:17:31,182
Look how much he loves you.

446
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:32,808
Good night.

447
00:17:34,686 --> 00:17:36,017
I love-

448
00:17:36,855 --> 00:17:38,482
you, too.

449
00:17:46,965 --> 00:17:48,796
Oh my god...

450
00:17:48,934 --> 00:17:51,459
Come on, she's only here
for one night.

451
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:53,595
I wish they'd just get a divorce and

452
00:17:53,672 --> 00:17:55,663
put all of us out of our misery.

453
00:17:56,075 --> 00:17:57,474
Is my hair really greasy?

454
00:17:57,543 --> 00:17:59,067
No, not really.

455
00:17:59,344 --> 00:18:00,368
Sometimes.

456
00:18:00,446 --> 00:18:03,813
She's just so needy one minute
and critical the next.

457
00:18:03,882 --> 00:18:05,349
Why don't you tell her that.

458
00:18:06,151 --> 00:18:07,641
I think it would hurt her feelings.

459
00:18:07,719 --> 00:18:09,448
Maybe I could pay someone to do.

460
00:18:09,521 --> 00:18:11,113
Do you wanna make five bucks?

461
00:18:11,890 --> 00:18:12,618
Good night, honey.

462
00:18:12,691 --> 00:18:13,988
OK

463
00:18:19,231 --> 00:18:20,425
Honey.

464
00:18:20,599 --> 00:18:21,088
What?

465
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:21,598
Honey

466
00:18:21,633 --> 00:18:22,327
What is it?

467
00:18:22,401 --> 00:18:24,301
We're supposed to do
the deed tonight.

468
00:18:25,170 --> 00:18:26,501
Oh, does that start tonight?

469
00:18:26,572 --> 00:18:28,039
The next four.

470
00:18:28,507 --> 00:18:29,769
Oh, cool.

471
00:18:31,043 --> 00:18:32,169
Do you think maybe
we should hold off

472
00:18:32,277 --> 00:18:34,837
until we settled for
the whole job thing?

473
00:18:35,414 --> 00:18:37,314
And that would be when exactly?

474
00:18:38,383 --> 00:18:41,079
Why are you in sure
that you are in ovulating?

475
00:18:41,153 --> 00:18:43,417
Yeah, it's what the calendar said.

476
00:18:43,489 --> 00:18:44,979
Tonight or tomorrow.

477
00:18:45,991 --> 00:18:47,083
Okay...

478
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:51,128
Look, if you're not up for it,
do not up for it.

479
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:52,296
I'm not up for it.

480
00:18:52,331 --> 00:18:53,958
It's just been such a crazy day.

481
00:18:54,166 --> 00:18:57,465
Okay, we'll do it tomorrow,
I guess.

482
00:18:57,536 --> 00:18:58,366
Twice.

483
00:18:58,437 --> 00:18:59,131
Yeah, all right.

484
00:18:59,204 --> 00:19:00,228
As if.

485
00:19:00,305 --> 00:19:02,102
OK, Thanks.

486
00:19:20,659 --> 00:19:22,183
Spoony?

487
00:19:22,427 --> 00:19:25,294
Clare Bear, I'm so tired.

488
00:19:25,898 --> 00:19:27,388
Spoo-oo-oo-ny?

489
00:19:27,466 --> 00:19:29,491
Baby, I just
want to stretch out, OK?

490
00:19:29,568 --> 00:19:30,466
Pull your head out of your ass,

491
00:19:30,536 --> 00:19:32,231
Babe, I want to be held.

492
00:19:54,326 --> 00:19:55,816
It's Ok. It's OK.
It's OK. It's me.

493
00:19:55,894 --> 00:19:56,758
Honey, are you OK?

494
00:19:56,862 --> 00:19:58,659
I'm fine.
Go back to sleep, honey.

495
00:19:58,764 --> 00:19:59,662
Mom?

496
00:19:59,765 --> 00:20:00,891
Myron, you're having a dream.

497
00:20:00,966 --> 00:20:01,523
Go back to sleep.

498
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:02,459
I'm sorry.

499
00:20:02,568 --> 00:20:03,057
It's OK.

500
00:20:03,135 --> 00:20:03,601
It's alright.

501
00:20:03,669 --> 00:20:05,159
Just sit down.

502
00:20:05,237 --> 00:20:05,794
We'll

503
00:20:05,871 --> 00:20:06,860
You alright

504
00:20:06,939 --> 00:20:08,600
Save the remodel for later.

505
00:20:11,276 --> 00:20:11,935
Are you hungry?

506
00:20:12,010 --> 00:20:13,043
Is it the way you wake me up?

507
00:20:13,078 --> 00:20:14,807
Do you want me to
make you some toast?

508
00:20:16,882 --> 00:20:19,976
I think your father's
having an affair.

509
00:20:23,522 --> 00:20:24,716
It's okay, Sammy Higgins.

510
00:20:24,790 --> 00:20:26,423
Go on back to bed.

511
00:20:26,458 --> 00:20:28,050
What are you talking about?

512
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:29,218
That's why
we were fighting about.

513
00:20:29,394 --> 00:20:32,261
I confronted him and
he lied to me, so I left.

514
00:20:32,331 --> 00:20:34,265
I left, and now I'm all alone,

515
00:20:34,333 --> 00:20:36,001
and I'd do just
about anything right now

516
00:20:36,036 --> 00:20:37,669
to get my hands
on an apple fritter.

517
00:20:37,704 --> 00:20:38,260
But... Neve mind.

518
00:20:38,337 --> 00:20:39,770
I'm fine.

519
00:20:39,838 --> 00:20:40,737
I'm perfectly fine.

520
00:20:40,772 --> 00:20:42,899
I just gonna Hey, sit down.

521
00:20:43,375 --> 00:20:46,278
Are you sure Dad-Put his thing
into another woman's thing

522
00:20:46,313 --> 00:20:49,213
and it felt good and
then he did it again

523
00:20:49,448 --> 00:20:51,814
and then he probably saw
or felt her boobs

524
00:20:51,883 --> 00:20:53,544
in the middle of all that?

525
00:20:53,785 --> 00:20:54,877
Yeah.

526
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:57,088
It's pretty clear to me, yes.

527
00:20:57,155 --> 00:20:59,953
Alright, come on, Mom,
there's no way Dad did that.

528
00:21:00,025 --> 00:21:01,822
You actually see him doing this?

529
00:21:01,893 --> 00:21:03,128
A woman knows.

530
00:21:03,163 --> 00:21:04,254
Trust me.

531
00:21:04,329 --> 00:21:08,459
It's like when you look at a person
and you know they're gay.

532
00:21:08,567 --> 00:21:09,499
You can just tell.

533
00:21:09,568 --> 00:21:11,035
Right... look,

534
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:12,897
I think we're both really tired.

535
00:21:13,071 --> 00:21:14,129
I mean we should
go to bed and talk

536
00:21:14,206 --> 00:21:15,696
about this tomorrow.

537
00:21:16,508 --> 00:21:19,378
I need a place to stay until
I can decide what to do.

538
00:21:19,413 --> 00:21:21,812
Now maybe you might know somebody

539
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:24,974
who could take me in for
a couple of weeks?

540
00:21:25,050 --> 00:21:26,383
A couple of weeks?

541
00:21:26,418 --> 00:21:29,616
Could get sure to clear my head?

542
00:21:29,651 --> 00:21:32,815
I... uh... maybe there are YWCAs...

543
00:21:32,891 --> 00:21:34,222
Those are nice.

544
00:21:37,429 --> 00:21:40,330
Hmm... OK.

545
00:21:42,968 --> 00:21:44,560
Okay. Okay. Okay.

546
00:21:44,636 --> 00:21:45,660
But listen to me.

547
00:21:45,771 --> 00:21:48,797
I need you to promise me
that you're going to be good.

548
00:21:48,907 --> 00:21:52,434
No prying, no chaos, no insanity,
no circus routine.

549
00:21:52,511 --> 00:21:53,307
You are going to like this.

550
00:21:53,378 --> 00:21:54,174
I want to see this.

551
00:21:54,246 --> 00:21:55,110
I promise.

552
00:21:55,213 --> 00:21:57,374
You are not gonna
even know I'm here.

553
00:21:57,482 --> 00:21:58,972
Scout's honor.

554
00:22:00,018 --> 00:22:01,781
That's not the Scout's honor.

555
00:22:01,987 --> 00:22:04,012
That's something like Star Trek.

556
00:22:04,089 --> 00:22:05,317
Good night.

557
00:22:05,557 --> 00:22:07,189
Thank you. Thank you.

558
00:22:07,224 --> 00:22:08,821
I'm gonna be so good.

559
00:22:11,463 --> 00:22:13,488
Honey, she wants to
stay for two weeks.

560
00:22:13,565 --> 00:22:16,366
Really? I guess that's okay.

561
00:22:16,401 --> 00:22:17,959
Doesn't she
have anywhere else to go.

562
00:22:18,036 --> 00:22:18,730
No.

563
00:22:18,804 --> 00:22:21,840
But how am I going to screen her
calls if she's living with us?

564
00:22:21,875 --> 00:22:24,035
She will break down all
our happiness of this house.

565
00:22:24,109 --> 00:22:25,142
Believe in my words.

566
00:22:25,177 --> 00:22:26,906
Don't be such a drama queen.

567
00:22:27,079 --> 00:22:28,410
It's OK.

568
00:22:28,513 --> 00:22:29,912
Just go to sleep now.

569
00:22:29,981 --> 00:22:32,415
Honey, I'm too worked up now.

570
00:22:32,484 --> 00:22:34,486
I need to get BJ to calm down.

571
00:22:34,521 --> 00:22:38,217
Nice try, good night.

572
00:22:53,405 --> 00:22:54,804
Good morning, Captain.

573
00:22:54,906 --> 00:22:55,964
What are you doing?

574
00:22:56,041 --> 00:22:58,032
Guess what? Breakfast is ready.

575
00:22:58,143 --> 00:23:00,236
Can I get this place
some privacy please?!

576
00:23:00,312 --> 00:23:01,973
Uh oh.

577
00:23:02,414 --> 00:23:05,577
Here comes the Grumpy Bear.

578
00:23:05,650 --> 00:23:06,981
I'm twenty-nine year old.

579
00:23:07,052 --> 00:23:08,385
I'm not playing Grumpy Bear.

580
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:14,791
Nothing stops the Grumpy Bear
but a big smile.

581
00:23:23,802 --> 00:23:25,963
When was the last time
you washed your bedspread?

582
00:23:26,037 --> 00:23:26,298
OK.

583
00:23:26,371 --> 00:23:27,255
Out.

584
00:23:27,290 --> 00:23:28,105
Go. Go.

585
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:29,573
What do you think,
the stink police?

586
00:23:29,641 --> 00:23:31,131
Get the creatures out of here.

587
00:23:31,209 --> 00:23:32,509
Alright, Sammy Higgins.

588
00:23:32,544 --> 00:23:35,012
Let's let your grumpy
brother get dressed.

589
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:35,679
Come on.

590
00:23:35,714 --> 00:23:36,612
He's not my brother!

591
00:23:36,681 --> 00:23:40,583
He's a dog and I'm human being.

592
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:43,754
And my sheets are not even...

593
00:23:43,822 --> 00:23:45,312
Oh my god

594
00:23:47,359 --> 00:23:50,988
Max, I need a minority
villain sergeant, please.

595
00:23:51,062 --> 00:23:52,996
Is he a lovely Indian?

596
00:23:53,265 --> 00:23:55,358
No. He's peaceful.

597
00:23:56,735 --> 00:23:57,827
Morning camper.

598
00:23:57,903 --> 00:24:00,633
There's some carob chip pancakes
on the stove there.

599
00:24:00,705 --> 00:24:01,405
Thanks.

600
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,533
Could you not smoke
in the house, Mom?

601
00:24:03,875 --> 00:24:05,706
How did I raise such a funny son?

602
00:24:05,777 --> 00:24:08,245
You're crack out
with jokes, sweetie.

603
00:24:08,513 --> 00:24:10,413
Is he African American?

604
00:24:10,482 --> 00:24:11,471
A little stale. Max

605
00:24:11,550 --> 00:24:14,041
Myron, I thought your writing
seminar was on today.

606
00:24:14,152 --> 00:24:15,847
Yeah, I got a push back.

607
00:24:16,188 --> 00:24:17,678
Is he Portorican?

608
00:24:17,756 --> 00:24:18,954
Excellent, Max.

609
00:24:18,989 --> 00:24:20,152
Fresh new take.

610
00:24:22,427 --> 00:24:23,593
What is that thing?

611
00:24:23,628 --> 00:24:28,190
It's a new voice recognition script
writing program called Max 9000.

612
00:24:28,366 --> 00:24:30,891
He's my digital
collaborator, watch.

613
00:24:30,969 --> 00:24:34,700
Max, I need a name for my new
minority villain sergeant.

614
00:24:35,073 --> 00:24:37,371
Max 9000?

615
00:24:37,909 --> 00:24:39,308
Try again.

616
00:24:39,578 --> 00:24:41,603
Victor Escobar?

617
00:24:41,713 --> 00:24:42,873
Perfect.

618
00:24:43,148 --> 00:24:45,241
Wow, writing is easy.

619
00:24:45,450 --> 00:24:47,213
You're telling me.

620
00:24:50,255 --> 00:24:53,418
Isn't it sweet to make Myron
take care of Sammy Higgins.

621
00:24:53,525 --> 00:24:56,756
I think Myron has some paralyzing
social deficiencies.

622
00:24:56,862 --> 00:25:01,492
So much fun getting out of
the house and be with my son.

623
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:03,167
Here we go!

624
00:25:06,238 --> 00:25:07,639
Mom, What are you?!

625
00:25:07,674 --> 00:25:08,298
Pick that up!

626
00:25:08,373 --> 00:25:09,362
What, oh...

627
00:25:09,441 --> 00:25:10,635
You're not Tiho Wuanita.

628
00:25:10,709 --> 00:25:11,368
Come on.

629
00:25:11,443 --> 00:25:12,933
I've obeyed the rules all my life.

630
00:25:13,011 --> 00:25:15,647
If I want to throw a little trash
on the ground occasionally,

631
00:25:15,682 --> 00:25:16,915
I think I've earned the right.

632
00:25:16,950 --> 00:25:18,075
That makes zero sense.

633
00:25:18,149 --> 00:25:19,417
To you maybe.

634
00:25:19,452 --> 00:25:19,783
Listen.

635
00:25:19,818 --> 00:25:22,548
Just go do your shopping,
and I'll come find you after.

636
00:25:22,621 --> 00:25:24,282
OK. Turkey Lips.

637
00:25:24,356 --> 00:25:25,516
Don't call me Turkey Lips.

638
00:25:25,857 --> 00:25:28,018
Okay, Honey Buns.

639
00:25:28,093 --> 00:25:30,152
I love you! Knock'em dead!

640
00:25:35,467 --> 00:25:36,832
Sorry!

641
00:25:37,736 --> 00:25:40,330
Thanks again for seeing me
on such short notice.

642
00:25:40,472 --> 00:25:42,372
Hey, what are former bosses for?

643
00:25:42,641 --> 00:25:44,268
So, the wife's good?

644
00:25:44,409 --> 00:25:46,001
Yes, very good.

645
00:25:46,244 --> 00:25:47,268
Kids?

646
00:25:48,179 --> 00:25:49,271
Not yet.

647
00:25:49,915 --> 00:25:52,406
Clare's pretty eager though,
... so we've been trying.

648
00:25:52,517 --> 00:25:54,007
Boy, I do know what that's like.

649
00:25:54,486 --> 00:25:56,386
The Mrs. Wanting
to settle down and nest.

650
00:25:56,454 --> 00:25:58,757
Bringing spousal pressure
on the head of the household

651
00:25:58,792 --> 00:26:00,554
to buckle under and procreate.

652
00:26:00,792 --> 00:26:03,161
Not a fun place to be in
if you're not ready to have kids.

653
00:26:03,196 --> 00:26:04,287
Do you know what I mean?

654
00:26:05,130 --> 00:26:06,392
Between you and me,

655
00:26:06,798 --> 00:26:09,164
there's plenty of things you can
do to lower your sperm count.

656
00:26:09,234 --> 00:26:10,580
Simple things.

657
00:26:10,615 --> 00:26:11,927
Excuse me?

658
00:26:12,003 --> 00:26:15,495
Oh yeah, I delayed
conception for months.

659
00:26:15,574 --> 00:26:18,873
I took scalding hot baths,
wore tighten underwear...

660
00:26:19,477 --> 00:26:21,502
anything to sap those nuts.

661
00:26:22,681 --> 00:26:24,672
Of course, rubbing one out
before sex is the best way

662
00:26:24,749 --> 00:26:26,910
to deplete viable sperm
from your load.

663
00:26:27,852 --> 00:26:28,716
Good to know.

664
00:26:28,787 --> 00:26:29,913
Thank you.

665
00:26:30,288 --> 00:26:30,777
So, anyway,

666
00:26:30,855 --> 00:26:32,220
I was surprised to hear from you.

667
00:26:32,324 --> 00:26:35,725
I thought once you became
Mr. Physical Therapy you'd be done

668
00:26:35,794 --> 00:26:37,557
with the carpet industry forever.

669
00:26:37,929 --> 00:26:39,062
Well, after I graduated from

670
00:26:39,097 --> 00:26:41,122
school, I worked a few years for-

671
00:26:41,566 --> 00:26:44,057
Carpet Bazaar,
Donnie Booker's speaking.

672
00:26:45,036 --> 00:26:46,230
Go ahead, I'm listening.

673
00:26:46,471 --> 00:26:47,438
Me?

674
00:26:47,872 --> 00:26:49,272
Oh. So, after college,

675
00:26:49,307 --> 00:26:51,639
I worked for
a number of private practices...

676
00:26:51,710 --> 00:26:52,540
Uh huh.

677
00:26:53,345 --> 00:26:56,007
- And although I gained
a lot of valuable experience,

678
00:26:56,081 --> 00:26:57,946
I found that environment
just wasn't for me.

679
00:26:58,016 --> 00:26:59,005
Uh huh.

680
00:26:59,684 --> 00:27:02,209
So now I just, I'm looking for
solid employment-

681
00:27:02,287 --> 00:27:02,686
You know

682
00:27:02,721 --> 00:27:03,954
Uh huh. Right.

683
00:27:03,989 --> 00:27:05,718
- And since you said
I always had a job here,

684
00:27:05,790 --> 00:27:07,519
I thought I'd take you up
on your offer.

685
00:27:07,826 --> 00:27:08,815
Blue.

686
00:27:09,260 --> 00:27:11,997
Your recent firing would ordinarily
be an enormous red flag

687
00:27:12,032 --> 00:27:13,624
to anyone with half a brain.

688
00:27:14,265 --> 00:27:15,698
I have two halves,

689
00:27:15,967 --> 00:27:17,834
and I believe in giving people
a second chance

690
00:27:17,869 --> 00:27:20,565
after they've thrown away
the best years of their lives.

691
00:27:20,872 --> 00:27:24,171
If you think you're ready to
take it to the next level, Mr.

692
00:27:24,509 --> 00:27:27,137
You can fill out some paperwork
and start today.

693
00:27:27,612 --> 00:27:33,175
Im ready to take it to
the next level and beyond.

694
00:27:34,185 --> 00:27:38,315
I guess all I can say is
take your shirt off.

695
00:27:39,691 --> 00:27:41,022
I'm kidding.

696
00:27:42,694 --> 00:27:44,355
Welcome back to the Bazaar.

697
00:27:45,563 --> 00:27:46,689
Thank you.

698
00:27:47,298 --> 00:27:48,993
That's really a good joke.

699
00:28:02,447 --> 00:28:03,675
Thank you so much.

700
00:28:03,748 --> 00:28:04,806
You're welcome.

701
00:28:05,016 --> 00:28:06,176
Thank you.

702
00:28:07,018 --> 00:28:07,950
See you tomorrow.

703
00:28:08,019 --> 00:28:08,781
I mean it.

704
00:28:08,853 --> 00:28:10,787
Thank you. Mr. Donnie.

705
00:28:12,724 --> 00:28:15,056
Mom, mom, what are you doing here?!

706
00:28:15,794 --> 00:28:17,352
I just got a job!

707
00:28:17,495 --> 00:28:18,189
Where?!

708
00:28:18,263 --> 00:28:18,854
Right here.

709
00:28:18,930 --> 00:28:22,024
They need a sales assistant,
someone to write up orders,

710
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:24,000
schedule deliveries things like...

711
00:28:24,035 --> 00:28:26,002
No, no, no, there's not way
they need anyone like that.

712
00:28:26,037 --> 00:28:29,666
I got done shopping so I came in
because it was so hot outside.

713
00:28:29,874 --> 00:28:31,569
Oh, remind me to ask them

714
00:28:31,643 --> 00:28:33,778
when them cleaned the
air conditioning filters last.

715
00:28:33,813 --> 00:28:34,369
Because you know what

716
00:28:34,446 --> 00:28:36,815
You can get Legionnaires
Disease if something

717
00:28:36,850 --> 00:28:37,733
Mom! Mom! Mom!

718
00:28:37,768 --> 00:28:38,616
- What?
- Focus.

719
00:28:38,917 --> 00:28:41,579
What happened was
I got talking to Donnie

720
00:28:41,686 --> 00:28:44,484
and he thought I'm gonna be
perfect for the job,

721
00:28:44,556 --> 00:28:47,650
and I could use the money
so I thought why not?

722
00:28:47,726 --> 00:28:50,024
Can you believe it?!

723
00:28:52,297 --> 00:28:55,365
I haven't had a job since I worked

724
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:57,595
at the House of Peanuts
before you were born.

725
00:28:57,669 --> 00:29:00,137
And now we're going to be
co workers!

726
00:29:00,338 --> 00:29:02,499
Hug me hard!

727
00:29:03,675 --> 00:29:05,233
OK

728
00:29:06,377 --> 00:29:06,866
You know, darling.

729
00:29:06,945 --> 00:29:08,310
It's your apartment.

730
00:29:08,379 --> 00:29:09,607
Take care of it.

731
00:29:10,915 --> 00:29:12,075
Good morning.

732
00:29:12,183 --> 00:29:14,777
I'd like to welcome everyone to
Carpet Bazaar orientation.

733
00:29:15,787 --> 00:29:17,084
Alright, cut the crap.

734
00:29:17,856 --> 00:29:19,380
We're going to
watch a safety video,

735
00:29:19,457 --> 00:29:21,687
then move on to
a tour of the facility.

736
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:22,292
Excuse me, Donnie.

737
00:29:22,327 --> 00:29:23,851
Do we have to watch this video?

738
00:29:23,928 --> 00:29:25,759
I mean, I've already seen it.

739
00:29:26,097 --> 00:29:27,564
What color is my lamp?

740
00:29:27,832 --> 00:29:28,799
Your lamp?

741
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:30,663
What color is my lamp?

742
00:29:30,735 --> 00:29:31,463
Gold.

743
00:29:31,569 --> 00:29:32,220
That's right.

744
00:29:32,255 --> 00:29:32,836
Its gold.

745
00:29:32,871 --> 00:29:36,363
Im the owner that means I make
all executive level decisions.

746
00:29:36,608 --> 00:29:38,075
What color is your lamp?

747
00:29:38,143 --> 00:29:39,175
His is silver.

748
00:29:39,210 --> 00:29:40,472
That's right, it's silver.

749
00:29:40,545 --> 00:29:41,637
Good initiative, Marilyn.

750
00:29:41,746 --> 00:29:42,678
Thank you.

751
00:29:42,747 --> 00:29:44,112
Silver means assistant manager,

752
00:29:44,182 --> 00:29:46,616
which means assistant
level decisions.

753
00:29:46,951 --> 00:29:48,145
Yours is bronze.

754
00:29:48,219 --> 00:29:49,743
No decisions.

755
00:29:50,155 --> 00:29:51,452
Put your hand down.

756
00:29:51,623 --> 00:29:53,352
The following safety
video contains information

757
00:29:53,424 --> 00:29:55,153
that may one day save your lives.

758
00:29:55,293 --> 00:29:57,090
I suggest taking notes.

759
00:30:01,266 --> 00:30:03,666
He seems very knowledgeable.

760
00:30:04,502 --> 00:30:06,732
It only takes a second.

761
00:30:06,805 --> 00:30:09,239
But watching the vide
feels like a lifetime.

762
00:30:10,475 --> 00:30:12,136
Oh my god.

763
00:30:15,513 --> 00:30:16,445
What's the message of that?

764
00:30:16,514 --> 00:30:19,677
Don't drive a wood panel station
wagon on the weather blizzard.

765
00:30:22,453 --> 00:30:23,044
Hey, you guys.

766
00:30:23,154 --> 00:30:24,212
I'm in here.

767
00:30:24,556 --> 00:30:27,457
Help! Help!

768
00:30:27,559 --> 00:30:29,186
Honey, heart goes out.

769
00:30:29,794 --> 00:30:30,995
To the actors? It's...

770
00:30:31,030 --> 00:30:32,257
But...

771
00:30:33,131 --> 00:30:36,396
Oh also you'll see the yearn of
the actress in this video

772
00:30:36,534 --> 00:30:38,303
Shhhh, Donnis could come back.

773
00:30:38,338 --> 00:30:39,634
He may quiz us.

774
00:30:39,704 --> 00:30:44,164
I want to be the person who knows
what my job is in requirements.

775
00:30:45,677 --> 00:30:47,008
We also have some
new product lines

776
00:30:47,078 --> 00:30:48,306
You'll have to
familiarize yourself

777
00:30:48,379 --> 00:30:49,471
with immediately.

778
00:30:49,547 --> 00:30:51,412
That should be a rewarding challenge.

779
00:30:51,516 --> 00:30:52,505
Pop Quiz.

780
00:30:52,617 --> 00:30:54,252
How many square yards
are there in a twelve

781
00:30:54,287 --> 00:30:56,049
by eighteen foot piece of carpet?

782
00:30:56,454 --> 00:30:57,386
Thousand?

783
00:30:57,488 --> 00:30:58,682
Twenty-four.

784
00:30:58,823 --> 00:31:00,552
Looks like somebody's already
forgot his conversions.

785
00:31:00,625 --> 00:31:02,320
OK? Don't let me down again.

786
00:31:02,393 --> 00:31:03,172
Hi, honey.

787
00:31:03,207 --> 00:31:03,951
Hi Donnie.

788
00:31:04,095 --> 00:31:05,062
Incidentally,

789
00:31:05,129 --> 00:31:06,460
I presume you can
maintain a professional

790
00:31:06,531 --> 00:31:08,089
working relationship
with your mother?

791
00:31:08,166 --> 00:31:09,497
Yeah, about that.

792
00:31:09,601 --> 00:31:11,068
I'm a little concerned
she lacks any

793
00:31:11,135 --> 00:31:13,126
qualifications whatsoever.

794
00:31:13,238 --> 00:31:14,466
I'm an incredible
judge of potential.

795
00:31:14,539 --> 00:31:15,438
She'll be fine.

796
00:31:15,473 --> 00:31:17,065
But she hasn't worked
since the peanut-

797
00:31:17,141 --> 00:31:19,234
Shhh. This is learning time.

798
00:31:19,310 --> 00:31:20,971
Take this opportunity to learn.

799
00:31:21,179 --> 00:31:23,511
OK. What's the most important
thing about sales?

800
00:31:24,983 --> 00:31:26,883
I'm pretty sure it's friendliness.

801
00:31:26,951 --> 00:31:28,248
No, the up-sell.

802
00:31:28,319 --> 00:31:28,614
Come on,

803
00:31:28,686 --> 00:31:30,586
shake the cobwebs out, man.

804
00:31:30,989 --> 00:31:32,286
Okay, quick refresher course.

805
00:31:32,357 --> 00:31:33,881
See the lady over there?

806
00:31:34,525 --> 00:31:35,389
I'm going to up-sell her,

807
00:31:35,460 --> 00:31:36,294
and youre gonna watch me.

808
00:31:36,329 --> 00:31:37,192
Understand?

809
00:31:37,262 --> 00:31:38,661
I think I'm starting to.

810
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:40,493
She's looking at Berber,

811
00:31:40,565 --> 00:31:42,999
but she's leaving
with Multi-Frame Wilton.

812
00:31:43,101 --> 00:31:44,090
Watch and learn.

813
00:31:44,168 --> 00:31:45,658
Go, Cheese.

814
00:31:48,106 --> 00:31:49,835
I see you're looking the Berber.

815
00:31:50,475 --> 00:31:50,839
Yes.

816
00:31:50,942 --> 00:31:51,966
It's very nice.

817
00:31:52,243 --> 00:31:53,904
But if you wanna go classy.

818
00:31:54,245 --> 00:31:55,837
You must look this one down here.

819
00:31:55,914 --> 00:31:57,506
It's Multi-Frame Wilton.

820
00:31:57,615 --> 00:31:57,842
Hmm...

821
00:31:57,916 --> 00:31:58,905
Check it out.

822
00:32:05,323 --> 00:32:07,086
Hmm... that feels nice.

823
00:32:08,793 --> 00:32:11,921
Yes, that's probably
the best carpet we have.

824
00:32:12,363 --> 00:32:14,354
I'm gonna try not
to be involved this.

825
00:32:14,432 --> 00:32:16,127
Look down the bottom.
Can you see it?

826
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:17,599
You may need to bend a little bit.

827
00:32:17,869 --> 00:32:19,166
Right there.

828
00:32:22,106 --> 00:32:24,233
Is he Samoanan?

829
00:32:24,475 --> 00:32:25,203
Hello

830
00:32:25,777 --> 00:32:26,976
Home again, home again, jiggity-jig.

831
00:32:27,011 --> 00:32:28,175
I don't know about you, but this

832
00:32:28,246 --> 00:32:30,441
working stiff could
sure use a cold one.

833
00:32:30,515 --> 00:32:32,176
Make mine a double.

834
00:32:56,040 --> 00:33:00,841
Sperm are dwindling... It's occupied!

835
00:33:00,979 --> 00:33:01,707
It's me.

836
00:33:01,779 --> 00:33:03,770
Your mom needs some Tums,
she ran out.

837
00:33:04,849 --> 00:33:06,441
Just taking a shower.

838
00:33:06,651 --> 00:33:09,415
A very mild and soothing shower.

839
00:33:09,754 --> 00:33:11,745
You're not
playing soapy worm, are you?

840
00:33:11,823 --> 00:33:14,189
Ha ha, you caught me.

841
00:33:14,392 --> 00:33:16,019
I'll be out in a minute.

842
00:33:24,569 --> 00:33:27,231
It's just so much fun
to be part of a team.

843
00:33:27,305 --> 00:33:28,272
Oh you know what, Clare.

844
00:33:28,339 --> 00:33:31,074
We get a 10% employee discount

845
00:33:31,109 --> 00:33:34,704
on every 2500 square feet of
carpet that we purchase.

846
00:33:34,779 --> 00:33:35,006
True.

847
00:33:35,079 --> 00:33:37,946
And they have
a big picnic every June,

848
00:33:38,116 --> 00:33:41,108
and they have a competitive
softball team, Myron.

849
00:33:41,185 --> 00:33:43,278
It sounds like you're really
enjoying yourself.

850
00:33:43,454 --> 00:33:48,448
You would be so proud of
Noah out there today,

851
00:33:48,526 --> 00:33:50,118
even though he didn't
talk to me very much.

852
00:33:50,194 --> 00:33:51,863
I figure he must be
working on his work

853
00:33:51,898 --> 00:33:53,524
when his customer service,

854
00:33:53,598 --> 00:33:56,829
not intentionally
ignoring his mom.

855
00:33:57,001 --> 00:33:59,128
Yeah, I was really proud of me,
too.

856
00:33:59,203 --> 00:34:00,870
Cause there was a moment
I'm gonna be honest

857
00:34:00,905 --> 00:34:05,638
that I'm a over qualified and
useless at the same time.

858
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:08,304
And then I saw the gigantic
piece of the carpet,

859
00:34:08,513 --> 00:34:11,346
and I realized that
the genie would be

860
00:34:11,482 --> 00:34:13,347
bottled in here the whole time...

861
00:34:13,551 --> 00:34:15,519
I think I'm the wiser for it.

862
00:34:20,525 --> 00:34:22,720
I had a nice breakthrough
on the script today.

863
00:34:22,794 --> 00:34:23,886
Did you?

864
00:34:23,961 --> 00:34:27,124
In the middle of a village raid
searching for mercenary VC,

865
00:34:27,265 --> 00:34:31,167
Tom Dawson starts to grow
a syringe-like proboscis-

866
00:34:32,637 --> 00:34:33,636
Excuse me.

867
00:34:33,671 --> 00:34:35,935
Slaker, weird nose.

868
00:34:41,579 --> 00:34:45,310
Well, I guess his attention span
isn't what it used to be.

869
00:34:45,783 --> 00:34:47,150
I just had a lot this moment, I...

870
00:34:47,185 --> 00:34:50,088
Oh my god, I have to get ready
for my Pain Pals meeting.

871
00:34:50,123 --> 00:34:50,720
They're gonna

872
00:34:50,755 --> 00:34:51,722
be here in any second!

873
00:34:51,789 --> 00:34:53,984
Clare, Dinner, Yummy

874
00:34:59,797 --> 00:35:01,822
Did you make any desert?

875
00:35:01,999 --> 00:35:03,330
In the fridge.

876
00:35:03,501 --> 00:35:04,968
Right on.

877
00:35:06,671 --> 00:35:09,231
So anyway, I've been eating
a lot of chocolate,

878
00:35:09,307 --> 00:35:12,538
which I know doesn't helped
my blood sugar level,

879
00:35:12,643 --> 00:35:14,873
and the chewing is causing
my TMJ flare up.

880
00:35:14,946 --> 00:35:15,469
Can you hear that?

881
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:16,840
Listen, here we go.

882
00:35:16,914 --> 00:35:17,280
Oh, no

883
00:35:17,315 --> 00:35:19,215
Horrible! Marilyn.

884
00:35:20,118 --> 00:35:21,819
I do exactly the same thing.

885
00:35:21,854 --> 00:35:22,342
Oh, honey.

886
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:25,453
You know about my son, Noah.

887
00:35:25,556 --> 00:35:26,250
Hi, Noah.

888
00:35:27,959 --> 00:35:28,948
Hi there.

889
00:35:29,060 --> 00:35:31,426
Dear, do you think you could
take a look at Barbara's foot?

890
00:35:31,496 --> 00:35:32,328
Her G.P.

891
00:35:32,363 --> 00:35:33,496
Says she has fallen her arches

892
00:35:33,531 --> 00:35:35,522
but she feels like
she needs a second opinion.

893
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:38,398
She should really see
a podiatrist about that.

894
00:35:38,503 --> 00:35:39,970
It's just a little peek, Noah.

895
00:35:40,071 --> 00:35:43,632
It's been so difficult getting
around on the bus lately.

896
00:35:44,208 --> 00:35:46,335
I'd really appreciate it.

897
00:35:46,410 --> 00:35:50,813
Well, since you're riding
mass trans, so I'll look.

898
00:35:51,749 --> 00:35:53,080
Thank you, Sweetie.

899
00:35:53,151 --> 00:35:54,516
I am worried about her.

900
00:35:54,685 --> 00:35:56,414
Oh, dear, look that, honey.

901
00:35:56,521 --> 00:35:58,011
Oh, right here.

902
00:35:58,823 --> 00:36:01,314
Oh, that, Oh, that's the...

903
00:36:01,959 --> 00:36:06,030
We were so sorry to hear about
you losing your job like that,

904
00:36:06,065 --> 00:36:07,793
but don't worry about it,
honey.

905
00:36:07,865 --> 00:36:10,163
I'm sure you're gonna
land on your feet.

906
00:36:11,969 --> 00:36:13,800
Did you hear that, Myron?

907
00:36:16,807 --> 00:36:18,741
Could I see you outside, please?

908
00:36:19,010 --> 00:36:20,705
Excuse me, girls.

909
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:25,514
What are you going to do, Marilyn,
hide out here forever?

910
00:36:25,583 --> 00:36:27,278
I'm an independent woman now!

911
00:36:27,351 --> 00:36:28,943
I've got a job!

912
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:30,078
Is she serious?

913
00:36:30,154 --> 00:36:31,382
Yeah, with me.

914
00:36:31,455 --> 00:36:33,673
Good! Now you can pay me back
for that

915
00:36:33,708 --> 00:36:35,891
refugee kid you send money
to every month!

916
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:37,120
It's a scam, you know!

917
00:36:37,228 --> 00:36:39,856
Don't you dare talk about
Joaquin that way!

918
00:36:39,997 --> 00:36:40,395
Joaquin?

919
00:36:40,464 --> 00:36:41,726
Last year,
wasn't it the Nastone.

920
00:36:41,799 --> 00:36:42,431
Jesus

921
00:36:42,466 --> 00:36:43,865
What are you looking at?

922
00:36:44,702 --> 00:36:46,795
Would you calm down, please?

923
00:36:46,871 --> 00:36:47,637
I don't want to calm.

924
00:36:47,672 --> 00:36:48,969
Would you please not
upset the Pain Pals.

925
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:50,439
They're very rootages.

926
00:36:50,741 --> 00:36:51,571
I don't wanna calm.

927
00:36:51,676 --> 00:36:53,643
I want my wife to live
where she's supposed to.

928
00:36:53,678 --> 00:36:56,078
That's a dream we all share,
but obviously she's mad with you.

929
00:36:56,147 --> 00:36:57,774
She said you
I know what she says.

930
00:36:57,915 --> 00:36:59,280
Did you

931
00:36:59,483 --> 00:37:01,974
Do you think any other woman
besides your mother

932
00:37:02,053 --> 00:37:04,248
wants my salty prune bag?

933
00:37:04,322 --> 00:37:05,289
You want to see it?

934
00:37:05,389 --> 00:37:06,857
I'll prove to you
how disgusting I am.

935
00:37:06,892 --> 00:37:08,825
I'll take a rain check, OK.

936
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:10,194
Is that my extension cord?

937
00:37:10,229 --> 00:37:11,388
No, it's mine.

938
00:37:11,462 --> 00:37:11,894
Are you sure?

939
00:37:11,963 --> 00:37:12,859
Yeah, believe it or not.

940
00:37:12,894 --> 00:37:13,755
I own my extension cord.

941
00:37:13,831 --> 00:37:14,991
Oh, but mine has
a green little tab by

942
00:37:15,066 --> 00:37:16,124
Would you focus?

943
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:17,258
On what?

944
00:37:17,335 --> 00:37:19,394
On how she gets to
make wild accusations?

945
00:37:19,503 --> 00:37:21,266
She has too much time
on her hands.

946
00:37:21,372 --> 00:37:24,000
She does nothing but invent
problems for herself.

947
00:37:24,208 --> 00:37:26,073
She reads too many spy novels!

948
00:37:26,143 --> 00:37:27,633
It's better than
watching Strategic

949
00:37:27,712 --> 00:37:28,711
Air Command all the time!

950
00:37:28,746 --> 00:37:30,839
Mom, just stand out of it, OK?

951
00:37:30,915 --> 00:37:32,473
Listen, if we're gonna make her home,

952
00:37:32,550 --> 00:37:34,347
you must move on to
talk to her like an adult.

953
00:37:34,418 --> 00:37:35,282
You know what?

954
00:37:35,653 --> 00:37:37,484
I think I'm through
talking for a while.

955
00:37:37,555 --> 00:37:38,749
You take over.

956
00:37:38,990 --> 00:37:39,820
See you, Noah. OK.

957
00:37:39,991 --> 00:37:41,458
Hey. Dad, don't be stupid.

958
00:37:41,525 --> 00:37:42,124
Bye bye!

959
00:37:42,159 --> 00:37:43,649
She knows where to find me.

960
00:37:44,562 --> 00:37:47,292
You people are out of your minds.

961
00:37:47,365 --> 00:37:49,333
It's all in your head,
you hear me?

962
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:50,398
That's the spirit!

963
00:37:50,468 --> 00:37:52,333
Way to find common ground!

964
00:38:03,447 --> 00:38:04,971
How's it going?

965
00:38:05,783 --> 00:38:08,775
These banks want to loan me
anything with my credit.

966
00:38:09,020 --> 00:38:10,419
What about asking your dad?

967
00:38:10,488 --> 00:38:12,922
Maybe he could co-sign
or something.

968
00:38:12,990 --> 00:38:16,892
My guess is he'd side
with the banks.

969
00:38:17,995 --> 00:38:20,293
Do you think he's really
cheating on her?

970
00:38:21,132 --> 00:38:26,627
No, I think my mom just needs
chaos in her life to function.

971
00:38:27,438 --> 00:38:29,372
I don't even know what
I'd do if I found out

972
00:38:29,407 --> 00:38:32,308
you were doing something like
that behind my back.

973
00:38:40,284 --> 00:38:41,308
In the bedroom?

974
00:38:41,385 --> 00:38:43,376
They come all the way off.

975
00:38:45,289 --> 00:38:48,554
Could I get two minutes
to brush my teeth?

976
00:38:52,396 --> 00:38:53,522
OK.

977
00:38:53,664 --> 00:38:54,926
Give me the winner.

978
00:38:55,232 --> 00:39:00,169
Too thin, Oh Geez, Oh yeah

979
00:39:00,471 --> 00:39:02,063
This is a rock.

980
00:39:02,306 --> 00:39:03,136
OK.

981
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:04,400
Let's go quick.

982
00:39:05,209 --> 00:39:06,540
Noah, What's wrong?

983
00:39:07,378 --> 00:39:08,208
Nothing.

984
00:39:08,412 --> 00:39:09,037
I'm fine.

985
00:39:09,347 --> 00:39:10,614
Honey, you're pulling my hair.

986
00:39:10,649 --> 00:39:11,376
I'am Sorry.

987
00:39:11,482 --> 00:39:12,312
OK, come on.

988
00:39:12,416 --> 00:39:13,678
Guys?

989
00:39:13,951 --> 00:39:15,282
Is there an extra pillow in there?

990
00:39:15,353 --> 00:39:16,877
Mine's really uncomfortable.

991
00:39:16,954 --> 00:39:19,821
Yeah, as uncomfortable
as a motel room?

992
00:39:20,691 --> 00:39:22,318
Right on.

993
00:39:28,032 --> 00:39:28,760
What?!

994
00:39:28,833 --> 00:39:31,199
Noah, are you sleeping there?

995
00:39:31,268 --> 00:39:32,803
Yes, I'm asleep.

996
00:39:32,838 --> 00:39:33,536
OK, good.

997
00:39:33,571 --> 00:39:35,504
Cause I don't wanna bother
you if you're asleep.

998
00:39:35,539 --> 00:39:38,099
If you're asleep I really
don't think we should talk.

999
00:39:38,175 --> 00:39:38,800
Mom?

1000
00:39:39,110 --> 00:39:39,709
What?

1001
00:39:39,744 --> 00:39:40,776
Spit it out.

1002
00:39:40,811 --> 00:39:42,972
Did you set your alarm for
work tomorrow?

1003
00:39:43,114 --> 00:39:43,678
Yes.

1004
00:39:43,713 --> 00:39:44,243
Good.

1005
00:39:44,315 --> 00:39:46,249
Okay, I'm just checking,
because you know.

1006
00:39:46,317 --> 00:39:47,685
I don't have a clock in my room.

1007
00:39:47,720 --> 00:39:48,751
And I'm excited

1008
00:39:48,786 --> 00:39:50,686
about work tomorrow
so I can't sleep.

1009
00:39:50,755 --> 00:39:53,747
And I took the wrong medication,
so I'm a little keyed up.

1010
00:39:54,458 --> 00:39:56,517
OK. I need you to
go back to your room

1011
00:39:56,594 --> 00:39:58,084
and not come out
the rest of the night.

1012
00:39:58,162 --> 00:39:59,151
Can you can do that for me?

1013
00:39:59,230 --> 00:39:59,753
Oh, sure.

1014
00:40:00,030 --> 00:40:00,724
Natch.

1015
00:40:00,798 --> 00:40:01,457
No problem.

1016
00:40:01,532 --> 00:40:03,363
And don't you worry about a thing.

1017
00:40:03,398 --> 00:40:05,194
And I didn't hear
you're doing that.

1018
00:40:10,741 --> 00:40:13,005
I don't understand
how you can let a few minor

1019
00:40:13,110 --> 00:40:15,271
distractions ruin everything.

1020
00:40:15,446 --> 00:40:16,413
See if you can tell me
what word

1021
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:18,344
Doesn't belong here.

1022
00:40:18,379 --> 00:40:20,209
Son, Mom, boner.

1023
00:40:20,284 --> 00:40:21,182
Whatever.

1024
00:40:21,252 --> 00:40:23,550
The Fertility Wizard says
for the next two nights

1025
00:40:23,621 --> 00:40:25,054
are going to be
the peak of my cycle.

1026
00:40:25,089 --> 00:40:27,683
So we have to do something
both nights, okay?

1027
00:40:28,025 --> 00:40:30,152
Sounds so romantic.

1028
00:40:31,162 --> 00:40:33,426
I have to be up early.

1029
00:40:37,201 --> 00:40:38,931
Spoony?

1030
00:40:38,966 --> 00:40:40,661
Grow up.

1031
00:40:47,912 --> 00:40:51,109
Hey! Hey! Hey! Stop! Stop!

1032
00:40:51,449 --> 00:40:52,279
What's up?

1033
00:40:52,383 --> 00:40:53,543
What the hell are you doing?!

1034
00:40:53,617 --> 00:40:55,919
Uh... I'm going to
the supermarket.

1035
00:40:55,954 --> 00:40:58,221
I found that
I need some soy beans.

1036
00:40:58,489 --> 00:40:59,956
It's one o'clock
in the morning!

1037
00:41:00,024 --> 00:41:01,013
Okay, alright.

1038
00:41:01,091 --> 00:41:02,126
You know,
I'm going over to your

1039
00:41:02,161 --> 00:41:03,388
Father's house.

1040
00:41:03,527 --> 00:41:04,551
You're going to spy on him?

1041
00:41:04,628 --> 00:41:05,628
I'm not going to spy on him,

1042
00:41:05,663 --> 00:41:08,098
I'm just going to discreetly
monitor some of his activities.

1043
00:41:08,133 --> 00:41:08,792
That's all.

1044
00:41:08,933 --> 00:41:10,195
See, this is what
I'm talking about,

1045
00:41:10,301 --> 00:41:11,700
you always stir things up.

1046
00:41:11,769 --> 00:41:13,236
Just get out of the car.

1047
00:41:13,304 --> 00:41:14,902
You know what? You can ignore

1048
00:41:14,937 --> 00:41:16,500
What's going on if you want to.

1049
00:41:16,574 --> 00:41:18,041
But I need to go do this.

1050
00:41:18,108 --> 00:41:21,236
So you can either come with me or

1051
00:41:24,548 --> 00:41:25,913
You rolled the windows up.

1052
00:41:25,983 --> 00:41:28,178
Isn't that obvious to you?

1053
00:41:29,086 --> 00:41:31,288
Why don't you get in the trunk
and let's have a conversation.

1054
00:41:31,323 --> 00:41:32,653
Anything out of...

1055
00:41:33,424 --> 00:41:34,823
What are you doing?

1056
00:41:34,959 --> 00:41:35,653
Get in.

1057
00:41:37,728 --> 00:41:39,252
See, there's nothing going on.

1058
00:41:39,330 --> 00:41:41,798
We've only been here five minutes,
be patient.

1059
00:41:41,866 --> 00:41:44,061
You know you look better from inside.

1060
00:41:44,168 --> 00:41:47,137
Maybe you should move back in
and call me with a full report.

1061
00:41:47,438 --> 00:41:48,336
I mean you really think dad's

1062
00:41:48,405 --> 00:41:49,997
going to bring another
woman back here?

1063
00:41:50,074 --> 00:41:51,166
With Grandma around?

1064
00:41:51,308 --> 00:41:51,933
Let me tell you something.

1065
00:41:52,009 --> 00:41:53,772
Helen's no fan of mine.

1066
00:41:53,844 --> 00:41:54,902
Maybe She's covering for him.

1067
00:41:54,979 --> 00:41:57,106
Maybe She's getting paid
for her silence.

1068
00:41:57,181 --> 00:41:58,808
I really don't know.

1069
00:41:59,416 --> 00:42:01,111
Who's paying her?

1070
00:42:01,785 --> 00:42:02,752
Zero one-thirty-four.

1071
00:42:02,820 --> 00:42:04,515
Nothing to report.

1072
00:42:06,423 --> 00:42:07,981
Do you want some corn nuts?

1073
00:42:08,792 --> 00:42:09,655
No thank you.

1074
00:42:09,690 --> 00:42:10,518
I've got plenty.

1075
00:42:10,594 --> 00:42:11,151
Thanks anyway.

1076
00:42:11,228 --> 00:42:12,596
They're high in fiber.

1077
00:42:12,631 --> 00:42:13,697
I'd love some.

1078
00:42:13,732 --> 00:42:14,396
Great.

1079
00:42:14,431 --> 00:42:15,598
Do You know what I got.

1080
00:42:15,633 --> 00:42:18,534
I've got Ranch,
Jalapeno and Barbeque.

1081
00:42:18,602 --> 00:42:19,626
You're surprising me.

1082
00:42:19,703 --> 00:42:20,692
OK.

1083
00:42:20,771 --> 00:42:22,170
One Ranch coming up.

1084
00:42:22,439 --> 00:42:23,201
Oh, what is it?

1085
00:42:23,307 --> 00:42:25,104
Oh my... Wait a minute.

1086
00:42:25,342 --> 00:42:25,808
Wait a minute.

1087
00:42:26,277 --> 00:42:27,176
Never mind

1088
00:42:27,211 --> 00:42:30,180
Dad's got a sex with her
in a little chair inside.

1089
00:42:30,247 --> 00:42:31,771
It's just Satan.

1090
00:42:32,082 --> 00:42:35,677
Your father would never admit it,
but she runs his life.

1091
00:42:35,753 --> 00:42:39,323
Sometimes it's easier to take
the path of least resistance.

1092
00:42:39,358 --> 00:42:40,449
Trust me on that one.

1093
00:42:40,524 --> 00:42:41,650
Zero-one-thirty-five,

1094
00:42:42,626 --> 00:42:45,390
mother-in-law confirmed
inside residence.

1095
00:42:45,496 --> 00:42:46,730
What are you laughing, hey?

1096
00:42:46,765 --> 00:42:48,213
That's very impressive

1097
00:42:48,248 --> 00:42:49,662
lingo there, Condor.

1098
00:42:49,733 --> 00:42:51,462
You know, you make fun of me,

1099
00:42:51,535 --> 00:42:55,562
but I've read a lot about
how the CIA operates.

1100
00:42:55,673 --> 00:42:59,006
I know how they do business at
the highest levels of government.

1101
00:42:59,076 --> 00:43:01,825
In fact, if I got in a situation
at the Pentagon-

1102
00:43:01,860 --> 00:43:04,575
Do you even hear what
you're saying, the Pentagon?

1103
00:43:04,648 --> 00:43:07,981
I'm certain based on
everything Ive read,

1104
00:43:08,052 --> 00:43:11,419
that I can find my way around
and get out of a jam.

1105
00:43:11,589 --> 00:43:13,181
I'd need a Glock though.

1106
00:43:13,257 --> 00:43:16,124
You know I'm so happy that
I was recruited for this mission.

1107
00:43:16,193 --> 00:43:17,626
I think the top brass
is going to be

1108
00:43:17,661 --> 00:43:19,060
really impressed
with our results.

1109
00:43:19,163 --> 00:43:19,390
You know.

1110
00:43:19,463 --> 00:43:20,691
You think that
I really enjoy this?

1111
00:43:20,764 --> 00:43:25,098
Is that what you really think that
I like spying on my husband?

1112
00:43:26,837 --> 00:43:29,670
I've known Gene since
I was sixteen years old.

1113
00:43:29,974 --> 00:43:33,034
He is my whole entire life.

1114
00:43:33,477 --> 00:43:39,848
And if I stopped...

1115
00:43:39,883 --> 00:43:41,118
Never mind, you know what.

1116
00:43:41,153 --> 00:43:41,550
Let's

1117
00:43:41,585 --> 00:43:42,711
Let's just go.

1118
00:43:43,454 --> 00:43:47,390
Surveillance ended
zero-one-thirty-six.

1119
00:43:54,865 --> 00:43:56,264
Rise and shine, Twinkle Toes!

1120
00:43:56,333 --> 00:43:59,632
Today is the first day of
the rest of your life!

1121
00:43:59,803 --> 00:44:01,202
Wow...

1122
00:44:18,956 --> 00:44:20,480
Bye bye, Sammi.

1123
00:44:21,592 --> 00:44:22,251
Bye Myron.

1124
00:44:22,326 --> 00:44:22,985
Bye

1125
00:44:23,093 --> 00:44:25,084
This also comes a red oak.

1126
00:44:29,299 --> 00:44:30,391
Oh, wait. Sorry.

1127
00:44:34,104 --> 00:44:35,435
OK. OK.

1128
00:44:43,247 --> 00:44:44,146
I used to using coffee.

1129
00:44:44,181 --> 00:44:45,910
But you could use it in oil.

1130
00:44:46,016 --> 00:44:47,244
Mom, hit it.

1131
00:44:48,252 --> 00:44:48,741
Come down here.

1132
00:44:48,852 --> 00:44:49,546
Look at it.

1133
00:44:49,620 --> 00:44:50,814
The dirty is like disappear.

1134
00:44:50,888 --> 00:44:52,150
Disappear.

1135
00:44:53,490 --> 00:44:54,479
Mom. Mom. Mom.

1136
00:45:35,833 --> 00:45:37,266
Hey guys.

1137
00:45:37,801 --> 00:45:39,200
What are you doing here?

1138
00:45:39,269 --> 00:45:40,634
I was just in the neighborhood.

1139
00:45:40,771 --> 00:45:42,295
I thought I'd stopped
by and say hi.

1140
00:45:42,372 --> 00:45:44,738
Sometimes when you
get some responsibilities.

1141
00:45:44,808 --> 00:45:46,105
You can't let it gone.

1142
00:45:46,777 --> 00:45:49,610
Don't you have the whole
responsibility to make the whole...

1143
00:45:50,481 --> 00:45:52,415
Is your mother still
being your mother?

1144
00:45:52,916 --> 00:45:55,578
She's trying to figure some
things out, I guess.

1145
00:45:57,254 --> 00:45:59,586
Would you like me to hand you
a glass of water, Grandma?

1146
00:46:01,759 --> 00:46:03,056
What are you watching?

1147
00:46:03,260 --> 00:46:04,921
Strategic Air Command.

1148
00:46:06,630 --> 00:46:08,757
Honey, I just did tell you.

1149
00:46:09,800 --> 00:46:11,461
Why are you fast forwarding?

1150
00:46:11,568 --> 00:46:13,536
I skip all the scenes
with June Allyson.

1151
00:46:13,604 --> 00:46:15,435
She does nothing but bitch.

1152
00:46:16,273 --> 00:46:18,366
That's June Allyson for you.

1153
00:46:19,309 --> 00:46:22,369
Look, there was another reason
I stopped by that...

1154
00:46:22,446 --> 00:46:23,913
Yeah, what's that?

1155
00:46:24,281 --> 00:46:26,010
Well, I've decided I'm going to
take a crack at running my own

1156
00:46:26,083 --> 00:46:27,880
physical therapy practice.

1157
00:46:27,985 --> 00:46:28,952
Uh huh.

1158
00:46:29,186 --> 00:46:30,452
And I was wondering since the

1159
00:46:30,487 --> 00:46:33,115
Bank's not really in a position
to loan me anything right now,

1160
00:46:33,190 --> 00:46:35,886
if you like to invest
a start-up money,

1161
00:46:35,959 --> 00:46:38,553
or cosign for a small
business loan.

1162
00:46:38,629 --> 00:46:40,221
We would be like partners.

1163
00:46:40,964 --> 00:46:42,727
What do you say, partner?

1164
00:46:43,967 --> 00:46:46,783
There's a lot of things
I would do for you, son,

1165
00:46:46,818 --> 00:46:49,599
but investing money in you
isn't one of them.

1166
00:46:50,007 --> 00:46:53,443
I've already got a lifelong credit
liability with your mother,

1167
00:46:53,510 --> 00:46:55,978
I'm not ready to take on
er protege.

1168
00:46:56,146 --> 00:46:57,113
I'm not doing this like this way.

1169
00:46:57,381 --> 00:46:59,212
Being a wife as a pilot.

1170
00:46:59,883 --> 00:47:01,510
Maybe Grandma could loan me some.

1171
00:47:01,585 --> 00:47:05,453
Oh that's right, that's where
your your generosity from.

1172
00:47:06,890 --> 00:47:09,757
I make practical decisions,
not popular ones.

1173
00:47:09,827 --> 00:47:13,422
Someday when you have a son,
you'll understand why.

1174
00:47:14,398 --> 00:47:16,798
Thank you for the pearl.

1175
00:47:21,438 --> 00:47:25,738
Okay, so Max, how can Escobar
capture Lieutenant Dawson

1176
00:47:25,843 --> 00:47:27,538
at the Mekong Delta?

1177
00:47:28,011 --> 00:47:30,275
Heavily-armed choppers?

1178
00:47:30,647 --> 00:47:31,341
It's been done.

1179
00:47:31,415 --> 00:47:32,905
Yeah... No...

1180
00:47:33,016 --> 00:47:33,812
Sounds tired to me.

1181
00:47:33,917 --> 00:47:35,782
Giant pest strip?

1182
00:47:36,019 --> 00:47:37,316
That's unrealistic.

1183
00:47:37,387 --> 00:47:38,322
OK. Wait a minute.

1184
00:47:38,357 --> 00:47:39,121
So what if...

1185
00:47:39,156 --> 00:47:42,785
How about Escobar orders
a napalm strike diversion,

1186
00:47:42,860 --> 00:47:46,091
and then what if shadow
ops ambush Dawson

1187
00:47:46,163 --> 00:47:46,629
OK.

1188
00:47:46,697 --> 00:47:49,359
While he's hatching eggs
in the rice paddy.

1189
00:47:50,267 --> 00:47:51,700
Breakthrough.

1190
00:47:51,768 --> 00:47:53,030
Breakthrough.

1191
00:47:53,103 --> 00:47:53,535
Ok.

1192
00:47:53,637 --> 00:47:54,236
We got that.

1193
00:47:54,271 --> 00:47:55,795
Please pass the astronaut ice cream.

1194
00:47:55,873 --> 00:47:56,931
Get it over here.

1195
00:48:02,913 --> 00:48:06,083
Alright, see you later soon.

1196
00:48:06,118 --> 00:48:06,572
OK?

1197
00:48:06,650 --> 00:48:07,207
OK

1198
00:48:07,417 --> 00:48:08,048
Good luck.

1199
00:48:08,083 --> 00:48:08,680
Sorry, honey.

1200
00:48:08,752 --> 00:48:09,980
We should be quiet.

1201
00:48:19,029 --> 00:48:20,360
Hi.

1202
00:48:20,530 --> 00:48:21,827
Oh.

1203
00:48:43,086 --> 00:48:44,280
What's wrong?

1204
00:48:44,788 --> 00:48:45,652
I just talked with my dad.

1205
00:48:45,722 --> 00:48:47,314
He's not going to help me.

1206
00:48:49,626 --> 00:48:51,560
That's pretty bad news then.

1207
00:48:51,662 --> 00:48:53,095
Yeah, it's bad timing.

1208
00:48:55,365 --> 00:48:56,525
I get it.

1209
00:48:56,633 --> 00:48:58,362
If my wife wanted to
get pregnant and I didn't,

1210
00:48:58,435 --> 00:49:00,767
I'd be pretty uninterested
in sex, too.

1211
00:49:00,871 --> 00:49:02,031
What?!

1212
00:49:02,306 --> 00:49:04,103
That is ridiculous.

1213
00:49:04,241 --> 00:49:05,007
That news to me.

1214
00:49:05,042 --> 00:49:07,977
Because every time
we try do something lately

1215
00:49:08,178 --> 00:49:09,736
you've got an excuse.

1216
00:49:09,813 --> 00:49:11,610
Oh, like getting fired,

1217
00:49:11,748 --> 00:49:13,340
watching my parents
marriage collapse,

1218
00:49:13,417 --> 00:49:16,053
or realizing I'm going to work
at a theme carpet store

1219
00:49:16,088 --> 00:49:17,351
for the rest of my life?

1220
00:49:17,386 --> 00:49:18,615
Those kinds of excuses?

1221
00:49:18,822 --> 00:49:19,186
You know what?

1222
00:49:19,256 --> 00:49:20,416
I'm actual I'm feeling it.

1223
00:49:20,490 --> 00:49:21,889
Let's do this, uh?

1224
00:49:22,025 --> 00:49:23,492
I'm gonna take a goal on you.

1225
00:49:23,560 --> 00:49:24,527
I know you.

1226
00:49:24,594 --> 00:49:26,755
I know when you don't
want to do something.

1227
00:49:26,830 --> 00:49:29,566
I've been very supportive
throughout all of this.

1228
00:49:29,833 --> 00:49:30,666
You're so supportive.

1229
00:49:30,701 --> 00:49:34,660
The only pregnancy question
you've asked in six months

1230
00:49:34,738 --> 00:49:36,603
is how big are
my boobs going to get.

1231
00:49:36,673 --> 00:49:39,699
Yeah, because I'm
worried about your back.

1232
00:49:39,843 --> 00:49:41,328
I don't want you to strain it.

1233
00:49:41,363 --> 00:49:42,813
I'm sorry if I care about you.

1234
00:49:42,848 --> 00:49:44,508
You are a piece of work.

1235
00:49:45,682 --> 00:49:47,650
God damn it.

1236
00:49:50,721 --> 00:49:52,245
Oh! Oh! Mom!

1237
00:49:52,322 --> 00:49:53,186
Get Out of the car!

1238
00:49:53,256 --> 00:49:53,822
What?

1239
00:49:53,857 --> 00:49:54,516
What are you doing?

1240
00:49:54,591 --> 00:49:55,956
Your father's
at the bowling alley!

1241
00:49:56,026 --> 00:49:58,654
I should supposed be
in that parking lot!

1242
00:49:58,729 --> 00:49:58,956
What?

1243
00:49:59,029 --> 00:50:00,257
What are you doing?

1244
00:50:00,397 --> 00:50:01,264
This is out of rage.

1245
00:50:01,299 --> 00:50:01,646
OK.

1246
00:50:01,681 --> 00:50:01,993
Listen.

1247
00:50:02,065 --> 00:50:03,065
I'm your mother, right?

1248
00:50:03,100 --> 00:50:05,159
I'm not a sort of bright joke.

1249
00:50:05,268 --> 00:50:06,536
You think you could
just push me around?

1250
00:50:06,571 --> 00:50:07,298
I have the right.

1251
00:50:07,371 --> 00:50:08,269
Just go back to your room.

1252
00:50:08,338 --> 00:50:09,032
Let me go!

1253
00:50:09,106 --> 00:50:10,300
She was going to
a Pain Pals meeting!

1254
00:50:10,374 --> 00:50:11,398
OK. Listen to me.

1255
00:50:11,475 --> 00:50:12,908
My house, my rules.

1256
00:50:12,976 --> 00:50:13,670
Rule number one,

1257
00:50:13,777 --> 00:50:15,210
stop stealing my car.

1258
00:50:15,245 --> 00:50:16,646
What are you
so afraid of finding out?

1259
00:50:16,681 --> 00:50:17,340
That I'm right?

1260
00:50:17,414 --> 00:50:19,348
Listen to me and listen wide
in the first begining.

1261
00:50:19,416 --> 00:50:21,145
Because this is
my final warning to you.

1262
00:50:21,251 --> 00:50:22,878
You can think about leaving
this house tonight,

1263
00:50:22,953 --> 00:50:24,580
or I'm taking you straight
to a homeless shelter.

1264
00:50:24,654 --> 00:50:25,120
Oh, yeah.

1265
00:50:25,188 --> 00:50:26,382
I'm scared.

1266
00:50:29,226 --> 00:50:32,718
You know, I wish just once you
could see yourself like I do.

1267
00:51:00,457 --> 00:51:03,527
I'am thinking about
what happened last night,

1268
00:51:03,562 --> 00:51:05,427
and if I upset you,

1269
00:51:05,495 --> 00:51:09,454
I just want to apologize
for my actions.

1270
00:51:14,504 --> 00:51:16,870
You're supposed to
say you accept.

1271
00:51:16,940 --> 00:51:19,204
Fine, I accept.

1272
00:51:19,276 --> 00:51:20,470
Good.

1273
00:51:20,544 --> 00:51:22,705
Now let's go sell some carpet.

1274
00:51:23,814 --> 00:51:25,145
Alright.

1275
00:51:30,287 --> 00:51:32,389
Yeah. No. No. No. I know Sir.

1276
00:51:32,424 --> 00:51:33,549
I know what you said.

1277
00:51:33,623 --> 00:51:34,954
I'd lovely do that.

1278
00:51:35,158 --> 00:51:36,853
So, where did you go?

1279
00:51:37,527 --> 00:51:39,119
Hey, so where's your vest?

1280
00:51:39,296 --> 00:51:40,092
Dry tempered.

1281
00:51:40,197 --> 00:51:40,891
Excuse me.

1282
00:51:40,964 --> 00:51:41,896
It's dry-cleaned.

1283
00:51:41,965 --> 00:51:44,763
If I catch you without it again,
It's a write up, understand?

1284
00:51:45,102 --> 00:51:46,126
OK

1285
00:51:46,203 --> 00:51:47,830
Now what's going on
with the Brisbane order?

1286
00:51:47,904 --> 00:51:49,769
I don't know,
my mom's handling it.

1287
00:51:52,209 --> 00:51:52,573
Where's your pay for...

1288
00:51:52,642 --> 00:51:53,768
Here!

1289
00:51:55,512 --> 00:51:57,002
I think she'd catch on quicker.

1290
00:51:57,080 --> 00:51:58,377
She's a slow starter.

1291
00:51:58,615 --> 00:51:59,980
Honey, She's sixty.

1292
00:52:00,050 --> 00:52:01,847
She's fired,
that's what she is.

1293
00:52:01,918 --> 00:52:02,942
What?!

1294
00:52:03,086 --> 00:52:04,354
She hasn't even
worked here a full week.

1295
00:52:04,389 --> 00:52:05,487
She's the worst Caucasian employee

1296
00:52:05,522 --> 00:52:08,291
We've ever had and
she's costing me money.

1297
00:52:08,326 --> 00:52:09,624
So, I'm canning her ass.

1298
00:52:09,659 --> 00:52:11,923
But she's the only one here
wearing her vest.

1299
00:52:11,995 --> 00:52:13,895
You're gonna fire
an employee in a vast?

1300
00:52:14,030 --> 00:52:15,691
Am I running a telethon here?

1301
00:52:15,866 --> 00:52:17,901
The quick ones make it
and the slow ones don't.

1302
00:52:17,936 --> 00:52:20,199
Darwin said that and
I'm sticking to it.

1303
00:52:20,270 --> 00:52:21,328
Hi there.

1304
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:25,431
Look, Donnie,
she loves

1305
00:52:25,609 --> 00:52:26,701
Excuse me.

1306
00:52:26,776 --> 00:52:28,573
It's all she's got.

1307
00:52:28,712 --> 00:52:31,840
Believe me when I tell you if you
fire her it's gonna destroy her.

1308
00:52:31,915 --> 00:52:32,939
You can't do it.

1309
00:52:33,049 --> 00:52:34,880
Actually,
you're her direct supervisor.

1310
00:52:34,951 --> 00:52:36,714
This falls under your domain.

1311
00:52:37,554 --> 00:52:38,418
That's a joke.

1312
00:52:38,488 --> 00:52:39,580
That's a sad joke?

1313
00:52:39,656 --> 00:52:40,623
No, I don't joke about

1314
00:52:40,690 --> 00:52:42,225
terminating someone's livelihood.

1315
00:52:42,260 --> 00:52:44,250
That I take very seriously.

1316
00:52:44,327 --> 00:52:44,691
Ok, you know.

1317
00:52:44,761 --> 00:52:46,422
I'm serious now about
firing my mom.

1318
00:52:46,496 --> 00:52:47,588
I'm not gonna do that.

1319
00:52:47,664 --> 00:52:48,096
Look.

1320
00:52:48,131 --> 00:52:50,031
Maybe I'm not making myself clear.

1321
00:52:50,700 --> 00:52:52,463
I'd like you to do this for me

1322
00:52:52,636 --> 00:52:53,933
or you're gone.

1323
00:52:54,237 --> 00:52:56,068
You need this job, right?

1324
00:52:57,707 --> 00:52:59,675
Do me proud.

1325
00:53:13,523 --> 00:53:14,387
Hi, Honey.

1326
00:53:14,457 --> 00:53:15,788
Donnie said you wanted
to talk to me?

1327
00:53:15,926 --> 00:53:16,221
Yeah, uh...

1328
00:53:16,293 --> 00:53:17,260
Do you wanna have a seat.

1329
00:53:17,327 --> 00:53:19,386
I was just reading
the employee manual.

1330
00:53:19,529 --> 00:53:21,326
It says we get a week's vacation

1331
00:53:21,398 --> 00:53:24,890
and five sick days after
twelve months service.

1332
00:53:26,469 --> 00:53:28,767
I've never had that
benefits before.

1333
00:53:29,372 --> 00:53:34,435
Uh... yeah, so, Mom,
I was talking to Donnie,

1334
00:53:34,578 --> 00:53:37,274
And he said he's been watching
you work the last few days

1335
00:53:37,347 --> 00:53:39,645
and he thinks
your skills might be

1336
00:53:39,716 --> 00:53:42,267
put to better use in another area.

1337
00:53:42,302 --> 00:53:44,819
Oh, really? You mean like greeter?

1338
00:53:45,055 --> 00:53:46,044
Well, maybe.

1339
00:53:46,223 --> 00:53:48,418
I think you'll be
a great greeter.

1340
00:53:48,692 --> 00:53:51,661
But I don't think that's
what he's talking about.

1341
00:53:51,728 --> 00:53:53,457
No. No.

1342
00:53:53,530 --> 00:53:57,296
He doesn't think I'm ready for
team leader yet, does he?

1343
00:53:58,001 --> 00:54:01,004
No, I think He feels
it would be the best

1344
00:54:01,039 --> 00:54:03,029
if you work at home
from now on.

1345
00:54:03,139 --> 00:54:03,628
I don't understand.

1346
00:54:03,707 --> 00:54:07,575
How am I going to do that when all
the carpet and customers are here?

1347
00:54:09,713 --> 00:54:12,910
I don't think he means working with
the carpet and customers anymore.

1348
00:54:13,016 --> 00:54:13,710
I don't understand.

1349
00:54:13,783 --> 00:54:15,216
What would I be doing?

1350
00:54:15,552 --> 00:54:17,110
You'd be... uh... you'd be...

1351
00:54:17,187 --> 00:54:17,744
Oh, I know.

1352
00:54:17,821 --> 00:54:18,685
I would be the telemarketer?

1353
00:54:18,755 --> 00:54:20,620
Fired, Mom.

1354
00:54:22,325 --> 00:54:24,418
You are fired.

1355
00:54:28,698 --> 00:54:29,864
OK.

1356
00:54:29,899 --> 00:54:31,526
I'd be fired.

1357
00:54:32,569 --> 00:54:34,662
I'm sorry... I tried to...

1358
00:54:34,738 --> 00:54:36,899
I told him how much...

1359
00:54:41,177 --> 00:54:43,338
Right... I...

1360
00:54:44,681 --> 00:54:47,707
I guess I wouldn't
need this anymore

1361
00:54:50,287 --> 00:54:51,845
OK. Here.

1362
00:54:56,159 --> 00:54:57,717
I'm fine, sweetie.

1363
00:54:57,827 --> 00:54:59,795
I'm perfectly fine.

1364
00:55:01,431 --> 00:55:03,524
It's not the end
in the whole life,

1365
00:55:03,633 --> 00:55:05,328
world everything.

1366
00:55:05,435 --> 00:55:06,094
You know, obviously,

1367
00:55:06,169 --> 00:55:08,160
someday when you and
I look back on this,

1368
00:55:08,238 --> 00:55:10,502
we're just gonna laugh, Right?

1369
00:55:21,051 --> 00:55:22,518
How'd it go?

1370
00:55:23,386 --> 00:55:24,648
Pop quiz.

1371
00:55:24,721 --> 00:55:26,416
How many square feet
are in this?

1372
00:55:28,892 --> 00:55:29,483
You're fired.

1373
00:55:29,559 --> 00:55:30,258
Do you hear me?!

1374
00:55:30,293 --> 00:55:32,523
The third time will
not be the charm for you!

1375
00:55:33,063 --> 00:55:34,928
Ha! Laugh's on you, Cooper!

1376
00:55:34,963 --> 00:55:36,794
That's stain resistant!

1377
00:55:37,567 --> 00:55:40,058
Mom! Wait a minute!

1378
00:55:40,670 --> 00:55:41,762
Cars!

1379
00:55:41,838 --> 00:55:43,669
Mom! Wait! Mom!

1380
00:55:43,740 --> 00:55:45,037
Mom!

1381
00:55:54,417 --> 00:55:56,214
I need your keys back, chappie.

1382
00:55:58,121 --> 00:55:59,281
I'm talking to you, ass.

1383
00:56:22,979 --> 00:56:27,916
Hey, So what are you in for?

1384
00:56:28,318 --> 00:56:33,017
I beat my boss senseless
with a foam scepter.

1385
00:56:42,065 --> 00:56:43,327
I'd prefer if you
sat over there.

1386
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:44,799
Sure.

1387
00:56:46,669 --> 00:56:48,136
Do you know how much
carpet I had to buy

1388
00:56:48,204 --> 00:56:49,762
to talk him out of
pressing charges?

1389
00:56:49,839 --> 00:56:51,170
Three and fifty feet.

1390
00:56:51,241 --> 00:56:53,038
Do you have any idea
how much carpet that is?

1391
00:56:53,143 --> 00:56:55,077
Four and sixty-seven yards.

1392
00:56:55,245 --> 00:56:56,678
That's on top of bail.

1393
00:56:56,746 --> 00:56:58,577
If you worked a little harder
on your marriage,

1394
00:56:58,648 --> 00:57:00,513
maybe you wouldn't have to be
so involved in my life.

1395
00:57:00,583 --> 00:57:04,178
How's that his responsibility,
he's not the one who left.

1396
00:57:04,287 --> 00:57:05,413
You don't know what
you're talking about.

1397
00:57:05,488 --> 00:57:08,048
No one knows how hard
I've worked on this marriage.

1398
00:57:08,158 --> 00:57:10,456
Then why am I
in the middle of mediating?

1399
00:57:10,560 --> 00:57:11,459
In case you hadn't noticed,

1400
00:57:11,494 --> 00:57:13,689
I've been the only one trying to
sit down and talk.

1401
00:57:13,763 --> 00:57:14,593
How could he notice,

1402
00:57:14,664 --> 00:57:17,100
he's too busy landing
himself in jail.

1403
00:57:17,135 --> 00:57:17,327
OK.

1404
00:57:17,400 --> 00:57:19,302
Don't you have
a some kind of baking magazine

1405
00:57:19,337 --> 00:57:21,202
or something to do there,

1406
00:57:21,304 --> 00:57:21,770
Look.

1407
00:57:21,838 --> 00:57:25,604
I know what you are going through,
but she's got to go home.

1408
00:57:25,675 --> 00:57:26,699
You have to pick her, not me.

1409
00:57:26,776 --> 00:57:30,234
Noah, your mom and I have been
at this for a long time.

1410
00:57:31,147 --> 00:57:35,018
For a lot of years I used to worry
she was going to walk out on me.

1411
00:57:35,053 --> 00:57:36,851
Not because I
was afraid to be alone,

1412
00:57:36,886 --> 00:57:39,878
but because I was afraid
to find out I liked it.

1413
00:57:40,256 --> 00:57:40,789
And guess what?

1414
00:57:40,824 --> 00:57:42,451
I like living alone.

1415
00:57:42,659 --> 00:57:45,753
There's no complaining,
no fights, no dogs,

1416
00:57:46,629 --> 00:57:48,187
I can just be me.

1417
00:57:49,165 --> 00:57:49,654
Don't get me wrong.

1418
00:57:49,732 --> 00:57:51,131
I love your mother.

1419
00:57:51,401 --> 00:57:54,928
She was the sweetheart of my youth
and I'll always love her.

1420
00:57:56,272 --> 00:57:57,967
Just not sure
what's supposed to happen

1421
00:57:58,074 --> 00:58:00,133
if I don't like her anymore.

1422
00:58:11,788 --> 00:58:13,187
Hi, there.

1423
00:58:24,067 --> 00:58:26,331
Myron, where did my mom go?

1424
00:58:26,603 --> 00:58:28,662
Monkey sidekick?

1425
00:58:29,072 --> 00:58:31,006
She told me not to tell you.

1426
00:58:31,074 --> 00:58:31,631
OK.

1427
00:58:31,708 --> 00:58:32,766
Where did she go?

1428
00:58:33,276 --> 00:58:34,868
Downtowner Inn.

1429
00:59:11,414 --> 00:59:12,847
Come here often?

1430
00:59:12,916 --> 00:59:17,410
Excuse me, I'm not allowed
to talk to strangers.

1431
00:59:17,487 --> 00:59:18,715
I'm sorry.

1432
00:59:19,188 --> 00:59:20,212
What I'm really sorry.

1433
00:59:20,290 --> 00:59:21,222
It wasn't by choice.

1434
00:59:21,257 --> 00:59:23,657
I just thought maybe it'd be easier
if you feel this is coming from me.

1435
00:59:23,726 --> 00:59:25,921
I have to say you have
a real delicate touch.

1436
00:59:25,995 --> 00:59:28,225
OK? I really mean it.

1437
00:59:28,898 --> 00:59:31,458
If it makes you feel any better,
I got fired, too.

1438
00:59:31,734 --> 00:59:32,894
You did?

1439
00:59:33,136 --> 00:59:34,398
Good.

1440
00:59:35,038 --> 00:59:37,939
Yo, Tony darling, two dirties.

1441
00:59:38,041 --> 00:59:38,473
We're good.

1442
00:59:38,541 --> 00:59:39,064
Tony.

1443
00:59:39,142 --> 00:59:39,665
Listen.

1444
00:59:39,776 --> 00:59:43,268
Let's grab things and
Just go home, alright?

1445
00:59:44,647 --> 00:59:46,512
Wasn't I a good mom?

1446
00:59:46,616 --> 00:59:48,106
Of course you were a good mom.

1447
00:59:48,184 --> 00:59:49,208
Let's just go, alright?

1448
00:59:49,485 --> 00:59:50,679
Yes, sure, let's just go.

1449
00:59:50,853 --> 00:59:52,616
Let's just run away and forget

1450
00:59:52,689 --> 00:59:55,385
how little Marilyn has
accomplished with her life.

1451
00:59:55,458 --> 00:59:57,358
Come on, Mom, You've
accomplished with your life.

1452
00:59:57,427 --> 00:59:57,859
Yeah? Like what?

1453
00:59:57,927 --> 01:00:00,452
What have I accomplished
besides having you?

1454
01:00:00,797 --> 01:00:02,321
All kinds of.

1455
01:00:02,599 --> 01:00:04,089
You know.

1456
01:00:04,434 --> 01:00:06,903
Right, nothing.

1457
01:00:06,938 --> 01:00:08,029
Not true.

1458
01:00:08,104 --> 01:00:10,698
Doing a wife, house-cleaner.

1459
01:00:10,773 --> 01:00:11,797
ZERO.

1460
01:00:11,874 --> 01:00:13,535
You did a lot of things.

1461
01:00:13,610 --> 01:00:15,339
You were very active.

1462
01:00:15,712 --> 01:00:19,739
You saved my rat Herman, remember?

1463
01:00:20,149 --> 01:00:21,416
The one with the skin disease?

1464
01:00:21,451 --> 01:00:23,214
Yeah, You could've just
put him to sleep,

1465
01:00:23,286 --> 01:00:26,189
but instead you scrubbed him
every day with medicated shampoo.

1466
01:00:26,224 --> 01:00:27,053
You saved his life.

1467
01:00:27,123 --> 01:00:30,149
That's like my greatest
childhood memory, mom.

1468
01:00:31,394 --> 01:00:32,053
What?

1469
01:00:32,128 --> 01:00:33,618
Herman's skin kept getting worse

1470
01:00:33,696 --> 01:00:35,425
and he started
having brain seizures.

1471
01:00:35,498 --> 01:00:37,022
So one night
when you were asleep,

1472
01:00:37,133 --> 01:00:38,395
I put him in a coffee can,

1473
01:00:38,468 --> 01:00:39,901
poked holes in the lid,

1474
01:00:39,969 --> 01:00:41,800
and stuck him
in the washing machine.

1475
01:00:41,871 --> 01:00:46,069
And next day I bought another rat
and put it in Herman's cage.

1476
01:00:46,309 --> 01:00:48,174
You drowned Herman?

1477
01:00:49,045 --> 01:00:49,739
I don't know what to say.

1478
01:00:49,812 --> 01:00:50,836
He was suffering.

1479
01:00:50,947 --> 01:00:53,383
Your dad was away for the weekend.

1480
01:00:53,418 --> 01:00:54,350
I didn't know what...

1481
01:00:54,417 --> 01:00:56,819
That's the worst thing
I've ever heard in my entire life.

1482
01:00:56,854 --> 01:00:59,287
You pukes a hole in the coffee
can and drowns a rat?

1483
01:00:59,355 --> 01:00:59,946
I don't know.

1484
01:01:00,023 --> 01:01:00,580
What can I say?

1485
01:01:00,657 --> 01:01:01,424
Is it the best idea?

1486
01:01:01,459 --> 01:01:01,685
OK

1487
01:01:01,758 --> 01:01:03,783
Do you have a friend you
could give a call?

1488
01:01:03,860 --> 01:01:08,263
P.S. I did the best
that I could with my life.

1489
01:01:08,364 --> 01:01:09,666
Is there anything else
I need know about?

1490
01:01:09,701 --> 01:01:11,293
Any other lies?

1491
01:01:11,501 --> 01:01:13,435
You wet the bed
until you were six,

1492
01:01:13,536 --> 01:01:15,936
the noise in your closet
at night really was a ghost,

1493
01:01:16,005 --> 01:01:18,838
and you were held back two times
in the first grade.

1494
01:01:18,941 --> 01:01:20,408
I'm thirty-one?

1495
01:01:22,645 --> 01:01:24,203
Thirty-two.

1496
01:01:32,388 --> 01:01:33,912
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

1497
01:01:33,990 --> 01:01:38,984
Thank you, Verlin, that was
as lovely as it was haunting.

1498
01:01:39,395 --> 01:01:42,762
Next up, please put your hands
together for Marilyn Cooper.

1499
01:01:42,865 --> 01:01:43,854
Marilyn?

1500
01:01:43,966 --> 01:01:44,489
Just go.

1501
01:01:44,567 --> 01:01:45,295
Sing your song

1502
01:01:46,069 --> 01:01:46,933
OK. Dear.

1503
01:01:47,036 --> 01:01:48,526
I'll be here aging.

1504
01:01:48,671 --> 01:01:50,468
Oh, thank you.

1505
01:01:50,707 --> 01:01:52,299
You owe me three birthdays.

1506
01:01:52,542 --> 01:01:54,373
Id like to bring
the room down a minute

1507
01:01:54,444 --> 01:02:00,610
and dedicate this next song
to my very special son, Noah.

1508
01:02:01,350 --> 01:02:04,046
He fired me from
the best job I ever had,

1509
01:02:04,120 --> 01:02:06,054
but I never accomplished
much in life,

1510
01:02:06,122 --> 01:02:09,726
so it really doesn't matter
if my husband fucks another woman.

1511
01:02:09,761 --> 01:02:11,660
And I murdered a rat.

1512
01:02:12,361 --> 01:02:13,953
Hit it, Lou.

1513
01:02:14,097 --> 01:02:19,160
Just try to understand,

1514
01:02:19,302 --> 01:02:22,897
I've given all I can

1515
01:02:23,406 --> 01:02:29,709
cause you got
the best of me

1516
01:02:29,979 --> 01:02:33,437
Borderline Take me home!

1517
01:02:33,549 --> 01:02:35,608
I've put him up for 36 years,

1518
01:02:35,685 --> 01:02:36,242
Ok. Just relax.

1519
01:02:36,452 --> 01:02:38,886
What's another
36 years next to me?

1520
01:02:39,689 --> 01:02:42,283
OK. No, No, No, Sammy Higgins!

1521
01:02:42,391 --> 01:02:44,120
Don't eat that!

1522
01:02:44,594 --> 01:02:45,322
Almost there.

1523
01:02:45,695 --> 01:02:47,788
This is not my room.

1524
01:02:47,930 --> 01:02:49,898
My room is by the ice machine.

1525
01:02:49,999 --> 01:02:50,966
Ok

1526
01:02:51,067 --> 01:02:51,829
Thank you, dear.

1527
01:02:51,901 --> 01:02:53,300
Just get into bed.

1528
01:02:53,870 --> 01:02:55,838
Can you put my nightgown on me?

1529
01:02:55,905 --> 01:02:56,701
No.

1530
01:02:56,773 --> 01:03:00,436
Why not, are you afraid of
seeing your mom naked?

1531
01:03:00,543 --> 01:03:02,311
Yeah, that's exactly
what I'm afraid of.

1532
01:03:02,346 --> 01:03:03,546
I got news for you.

1533
01:03:03,581 --> 01:03:04,478
OK, but...

1534
01:03:04,547 --> 01:03:05,707
I still have a pretty good body,

1535
01:03:05,782 --> 01:03:07,682
even though I haven't
had sex in five years.

1536
01:03:07,784 --> 01:03:09,274
Five

1537
01:03:10,286 --> 01:03:11,947
Sex

1538
01:03:12,522 --> 01:03:13,921
Can I get you anything?

1539
01:03:16,259 --> 01:03:21,219
Can you take me back to 1968
so I could start it all over again?

1540
01:03:21,330 --> 01:03:23,059
No, not this second.

1541
01:03:23,366 --> 01:03:24,731
That's too bad.

1542
01:03:26,536 --> 01:03:29,096
I'd like to start it
all over again.

1543
01:03:30,106 --> 01:03:31,664
Good night.

1544
01:03:50,726 --> 01:03:52,091
What are these?

1545
01:03:52,662 --> 01:03:55,256
I've been tried
some new briefs out.

1546
01:03:55,331 --> 01:03:56,958
Try it for more support

1547
01:03:57,066 --> 01:03:59,728
These are like four sizes
too small for you.

1548
01:03:59,869 --> 01:04:01,803
Oh, that explains a lot.

1549
01:04:01,871 --> 01:04:05,102
I must read the label
I'll return them tomorrow.

1550
01:04:06,075 --> 01:04:08,475
You're trying to sabotage
your sperm count, aren't you?

1551
01:04:08,544 --> 01:04:08,976
What?!

1552
01:04:09,011 --> 01:04:10,672
That's why it's taking so long.

1553
01:04:10,746 --> 01:04:14,079
No, it's taking so long because
our schedules don't match on.

1554
01:04:14,150 --> 01:04:16,516
You have some serious problems,
you know that?

1555
01:04:16,719 --> 01:04:18,277
Okay, you throw
an underwear on me.

1556
01:04:18,354 --> 01:04:20,254
I think we need to
go to the Honesty Zone.

1557
01:04:20,323 --> 01:04:21,312
Screw the Honesty Zone!

1558
01:04:21,390 --> 01:04:22,857
I hate the Honesty Zone!

1559
01:04:22,959 --> 01:04:25,086
OK. Don't dismiss
the Honesty Zone like that.

1560
01:04:25,161 --> 01:04:25,923
Not cool.

1561
01:04:25,995 --> 01:04:26,893
What do you wanna do that?

1562
01:04:26,963 --> 01:04:27,895
You don't wanna find out.

1563
01:04:27,964 --> 01:04:29,397
You know, maybe this whole
have got so much

1564
01:04:29,465 --> 01:04:30,933
on my plate routine
has nothing to do

1565
01:04:30,968 --> 01:04:32,696
with your job or your mom.

1566
01:04:32,768 --> 01:04:34,303
Maybe it has something
to do with me.

1567
01:04:34,338 --> 01:04:35,805
This has nothing to do with you.

1568
01:04:35,840 --> 01:04:36,863
Don't be ridiculous.

1569
01:04:36,939 --> 01:04:37,200
Please.

1570
01:04:37,273 --> 01:04:39,138
I need you to be honest
with me right now.

1571
01:04:39,208 --> 01:04:41,267
And tell me if it's me
you're unhappy with.

1572
01:04:41,344 --> 01:04:43,437
No, I'm not unhappy with you.

1573
01:04:43,579 --> 01:04:44,603
Anything else?

1574
01:04:44,680 --> 01:04:46,682
Have you been trying to keep me
from getting pregnant?

1575
01:04:46,717 --> 01:04:47,706
No.

1576
01:04:47,783 --> 01:04:48,374
Yes, I have.

1577
01:04:48,484 --> 01:04:48,779
What?

1578
01:04:48,851 --> 01:04:49,818
But only a couple of times.

1579
01:04:49,886 --> 01:04:50,351
Oh my god.

1580
01:04:50,386 --> 01:04:51,648
How could you do that?

1581
01:04:51,721 --> 01:04:52,585
Why are ypu going so upset?

1582
01:04:52,655 --> 01:04:53,679
I'm being honest with you!

1583
01:04:53,756 --> 01:04:55,018
Oh, now you're
trying to be honest!

1584
01:04:55,091 --> 01:04:57,082
My life's coming apart
at the seams and all

1585
01:04:57,159 --> 01:04:57,955
you want to do is get on me

1586
01:04:58,027 --> 01:04:59,892
and grind out like
a mechanical bull?

1587
01:04:59,962 --> 01:05:02,021
All you had to do was
tell me you wanted to wait.

1588
01:05:02,131 --> 01:05:03,564
Yeah, I'm sure that
would have fit right

1589
01:05:03,633 --> 01:05:05,430
in with your species
propagation agenda.

1590
01:05:05,534 --> 01:05:08,059
My agenda? We both agreed to this.

1591
01:05:08,237 --> 01:05:11,832
I didn't agree to my wife becoming
a single-minded fertility robot.

1592
01:05:12,041 --> 01:05:13,099
I need more sperms.

1593
01:05:13,209 --> 01:05:15,734
I don't need more sperm, OK?

1594
01:05:16,379 --> 01:05:18,813
Look, I need you to stop
putting all these on me.

1595
01:05:18,915 --> 01:05:19,680
It's not fair.

1596
01:05:19,715 --> 01:05:21,481
I'm not even putting it on you.

1597
01:05:21,516 --> 01:05:23,248
It is clearly the baby's fault.

1598
01:05:23,319 --> 01:05:25,721
I need you to stop making excuses.

1599
01:05:25,756 --> 01:05:26,153
Fine.

1600
01:05:26,188 --> 01:05:26,767
What else?

1601
01:05:26,802 --> 01:05:27,347
I need you to-

1602
01:05:27,423 --> 01:05:28,155
Done.

1603
01:05:28,190 --> 01:05:28,991
I didn't finish.

1604
01:05:29,026 --> 01:05:29,252
Let me...

1605
01:05:29,325 --> 01:05:29,824
Oh, I agree.

1606
01:05:29,859 --> 01:05:30,776
You talk and I agree.

1607
01:05:30,811 --> 01:05:31,659
That's the deal, right?

1608
01:05:31,694 --> 01:05:32,956
You're being stupid
and immature!

1609
01:05:33,029 --> 01:05:33,961
I agree again!

1610
01:05:33,996 --> 01:05:34,826
We're in total agreement!

1611
01:05:34,897 --> 01:05:36,262
Look how well we're communicating!

1612
01:05:36,332 --> 01:05:37,560
Out! Get out!

1613
01:05:37,633 --> 01:05:38,998
You're not sleeping
in here tonight!

1614
01:05:39,068 --> 01:05:40,330
I got bad news for you.

1615
01:05:40,403 --> 01:05:41,870
I won't leave this room.

1616
01:05:43,172 --> 01:05:45,902
Ha! Real mature!

1617
01:05:47,576 --> 01:05:49,942
Sweet! My blanket's stuck in the door.

1618
01:05:58,187 --> 01:05:59,882
Rough night with the old lady?

1619
01:05:59,989 --> 01:06:01,422
Why are you here?

1620
01:06:01,857 --> 01:06:04,792
Clare said I could stay here
for my writing seminar, remember?

1621
01:06:04,894 --> 01:06:07,158
Yeah, that was supposed to
last Tuesday.

1622
01:06:07,296 --> 01:06:08,456
It got pushed back.

1623
01:06:08,531 --> 01:06:09,225
So...

1624
01:06:09,298 --> 01:06:10,424
To when?

1625
01:06:10,533 --> 01:06:13,263
That was three days ago,
I've had two jobs since then.

1626
01:06:13,336 --> 01:06:14,166
What have you been doing?

1627
01:06:14,236 --> 01:06:15,136
You've just been
sitting on the couch

1628
01:06:15,171 --> 01:06:19,232
in your sofa fantasy land be my
mother's little monkey sidekick.

1629
01:06:19,308 --> 01:06:21,142
Monkey sidekick.

1630
01:06:21,177 --> 01:06:23,236
There is no writing seminar,
is there?

1631
01:06:29,552 --> 01:06:30,075
I'm sorry.

1632
01:06:30,186 --> 01:06:31,710
Could you say that again
into my good ear, please?

1633
01:06:32,021 --> 01:06:33,579
I can't hear you.

1634
01:06:37,360 --> 01:06:39,453
I made the seminar up.

1635
01:06:39,528 --> 01:06:40,620
You

1636
01:06:41,664 --> 01:06:43,859
My parents kicked me
out of their house.

1637
01:06:44,533 --> 01:06:46,831
So I've got no money.

1638
01:06:46,936 --> 01:06:49,029
I've got no place to go.

1639
01:06:49,271 --> 01:06:50,898
That's outstanding.

1640
01:06:51,040 --> 01:06:53,474
When exactly were you
planning on leaving?

1641
01:06:53,576 --> 01:06:54,304
I don't know.

1642
01:06:54,377 --> 01:06:55,844
I'm still working on that.

1643
01:06:55,911 --> 01:06:57,310
You're working on it?

1644
01:06:57,580 --> 01:07:00,515
You know what you remind me of
that bad movie that's on cable

1645
01:07:00,683 --> 01:07:01,980
At two in the morning.

1646
01:07:02,051 --> 01:07:04,178
It's on because something
has to fill the void.

1647
01:07:04,253 --> 01:07:06,722
That's what your life is
like to me, filler and void.

1648
01:07:06,757 --> 01:07:08,121
This week on Filler and Void,

1649
01:07:08,190 --> 01:07:11,717
detective Myron Stubbs finds an
unproduced screenplay in his diaper.

1650
01:07:11,794 --> 01:07:12,526
Oh, I'm sorry.

1651
01:07:12,561 --> 01:07:15,587
Did I dishonor Vietnam
Mosquito Soldier?

1652
01:07:16,432 --> 01:07:17,490
You know what I'd like to see?

1653
01:07:17,566 --> 01:07:20,592
I'd like to see Tom Dawson
fired by his own platoon.

1654
01:07:20,669 --> 01:07:21,226
What do you think?

1655
01:07:21,303 --> 01:07:21,869
Do you think
it's a good idea?

1656
01:07:21,904 --> 01:07:23,571
Or should I ask your
little friend, Max?

1657
01:07:23,606 --> 01:07:25,198
Hey, Max, what do you think of
my great new idea?

1658
01:07:25,274 --> 01:07:26,673
I think it would win Oscar.

1659
01:07:26,742 --> 01:07:27,871
Thank you, Max.

1660
01:07:27,906 --> 01:07:29,001
You know what?

1661
01:07:29,078 --> 01:07:30,077
Why don't you do us all a favor

1662
01:07:30,112 --> 01:07:32,672
and write something that actually
benefits humankind, okay?

1663
01:07:32,748 --> 01:07:33,942
But do us an even bigger favor

1664
01:07:34,016 --> 01:07:36,041
and don't write it
in our living room.

1665
01:07:41,057 --> 01:07:44,083
I know I'm not the greatest
writer in the world.

1666
01:07:44,760 --> 01:07:48,389
I'm sure a lot of people think
the stuff I do isn't very good.

1667
01:07:49,698 --> 01:07:51,290
But I enjoy doing it.

1668
01:07:51,367 --> 01:07:52,834
It keeps me going.

1669
01:07:53,769 --> 01:07:54,360
And believe me,

1670
01:07:54,437 --> 01:07:56,200
under this confident
exterior is a guy

1671
01:07:56,305 --> 01:07:59,206
with just as many doubts
and insecurities as you.

1672
01:07:59,542 --> 01:08:03,205
Except you have a beautiful wife
and a mother who loves you

1673
01:08:04,780 --> 01:08:06,543
I just have me.

1674
01:08:08,918 --> 01:08:10,078
So I'm sorry to
stuff what I do

1675
01:08:10,152 --> 01:08:11,517
if it doesn't interest
you very much,

1676
01:08:11,587 --> 01:08:15,683
but I can't really change
what makes me happy.

1677
01:08:20,096 --> 01:08:21,929
Anyway, this blanket
is extra, so...

1678
01:08:21,964 --> 01:08:26,128
I'll just go blow up the Aerobed
so you can have the couch.

1679
01:08:34,844 --> 01:08:35,936
Where are you going?

1680
01:08:36,045 --> 01:08:37,273
To search for Yeti.

1681
01:08:37,346 --> 01:08:39,473
Can we please talk like adults?

1682
01:08:39,548 --> 01:08:40,139
You bet.

1683
01:08:40,216 --> 01:08:42,446
Call me when you find one.

1684
01:08:46,122 --> 01:08:48,317
Your mom stole my car.

1685
01:08:49,525 --> 01:08:50,082
I mean.

1686
01:08:50,159 --> 01:08:51,251
Listen to yourself.

1687
01:08:51,327 --> 01:08:52,954
You're acting like
I'm hiding all these deep,

1688
01:08:53,129 --> 01:08:54,596
dark secrets or something.

1689
01:08:54,663 --> 01:08:55,823
You are.

1690
01:08:55,931 --> 01:08:57,831
You're wearing toddler briefs,

1691
01:08:57,933 --> 01:09:00,993
you're sabotaging jobs
to avoid having kids-

1692
01:09:01,070 --> 01:09:02,560
That's not true.

1693
01:09:02,638 --> 01:09:03,263
Yes, it is.

1694
01:09:03,339 --> 01:09:04,101
I didn't even have time to

1695
01:09:04,173 --> 01:09:06,573
sabotage myself
at the carpet store.

1696
01:09:06,642 --> 01:09:08,371
Honey, it's not what on.

1697
01:09:09,578 --> 01:09:11,876
You got fired from
the carpet store?

1698
01:09:11,981 --> 01:09:13,778
I didn't tell you that?

1699
01:09:14,717 --> 01:09:15,081
Noah

1700
01:09:15,184 --> 01:09:16,412
Sweetie

1701
01:09:16,519 --> 01:09:17,076
Clare Bear

1702
01:09:17,153 --> 01:09:19,087
Clare Bare, Me

1703
01:09:19,655 --> 01:09:23,751
Honey, I was in jail, I didn't
have time to tell you!

1704
01:09:24,293 --> 01:09:25,624
Where are you going?!

1705
01:09:25,694 --> 01:09:28,720
Holly's! Feel free not to call!

1706
01:09:28,797 --> 01:09:29,286
Where are you?

1707
01:09:29,365 --> 01:09:31,595
Holly's or Molly

1708
01:09:31,734 --> 01:09:33,531
Holly's

1709
01:09:36,872 --> 01:09:38,669
Oh my god...

1710
01:09:40,709 --> 01:09:41,903
Mom! Mom!

1711
01:10:19,114 --> 01:10:20,411
Nice shot, mom.

1712
01:10:20,482 --> 01:10:22,643
Now you're working on a turkey.

1713
01:10:23,953 --> 01:10:24,920
Excuse me.

1714
01:10:26,322 --> 01:10:27,550
I want to know who she is?

1715
01:10:27,623 --> 01:10:28,885
Was it Phyllis?!

1716
01:10:28,958 --> 01:10:30,050
AHH! What are you doing here?!

1717
01:10:30,125 --> 01:10:30,716
I'm bowling here.

1718
01:10:30,793 --> 01:10:31,782
Is it Susan?!

1719
01:10:31,860 --> 01:10:32,656
That's who it is, isn't it?

1720
01:10:32,828 --> 01:10:33,522
Mom, let's go home.

1721
01:10:33,596 --> 01:10:34,028
Let's go home.

1722
01:10:34,096 --> 01:10:36,665
No, I'm not leaving here until
you give me an answer.

1723
01:10:36,700 --> 01:10:37,859
I've got an answer for you.

1724
01:10:37,933 --> 01:10:39,491
Crazy, ungrateful bitch.

1725
01:10:39,568 --> 01:10:40,694
You want to hear
what the question is?

1726
01:10:40,769 --> 01:10:41,736
You're pathetic, Gene.

1727
01:10:41,804 --> 01:10:42,702
It's all in your head, Marilyn.

1728
01:10:42,805 --> 01:10:43,066
Oh

1729
01:10:43,138 --> 01:10:44,506
You're an out-of-control dope thing!

1730
01:10:44,541 --> 01:10:45,404
Stay out of it, Grandma.

1731
01:10:45,474 --> 01:10:47,772
I tried very hard to give you
everything you wanted.

1732
01:10:47,843 --> 01:10:49,278
You think that it was
money that I wanted.

1733
01:10:49,313 --> 01:10:51,473
You think that it was
the furniture

1734
01:10:51,547 --> 01:10:52,777
You think I want clothes.

1735
01:10:52,812 --> 01:10:54,008
But that's not I wanted.

1736
01:10:54,083 --> 01:10:55,710
I want more.

1737
01:10:55,784 --> 01:10:56,818
Did everybody hear that one?

1738
01:10:56,853 --> 01:10:57,818
She wanted more than that.

1739
01:10:57,853 --> 01:10:59,218
And he put up with your moods and

1740
01:10:59,288 --> 01:11:00,346
Your complaining and your dogs!

1741
01:11:00,422 --> 01:11:02,083
I wanted more of you!

1742
01:11:02,157 --> 01:11:03,954
Maybe we could find a better
time to discuss this.

1743
01:11:04,159 --> 01:11:05,524
If he can look me
straight in the eye

1744
01:11:05,594 --> 01:11:06,458
and tell me the truth,

1745
01:11:06,528 --> 01:11:08,428
I'll leave your house and you'll

1746
01:11:08,497 --> 01:11:11,762
never have to see me
or my dogs again.

1747
01:11:11,834 --> 01:11:12,698
Dad?

1748
01:11:12,768 --> 01:11:16,704
What, does Gene have to account
for himself yet again?

1749
01:11:16,772 --> 01:11:18,103
I am a respected man!

1750
01:11:18,641 --> 01:11:19,801
I served my country!

1751
01:11:19,875 --> 01:11:21,342
I did what was asked to me!

1752
01:11:21,543 --> 01:11:25,001
Did you or did you not
have an affair?!

1753
01:11:25,080 --> 01:11:27,048
No, I didn't have an affair!

1754
01:11:28,484 --> 01:11:30,349
It was a one night stand!

1755
01:11:33,922 --> 01:11:35,787
Twice!

1756
01:11:37,393 --> 01:11:38,592
I defended you.

1757
01:11:38,627 --> 01:11:40,094
Well no one asked you to.

1758
01:11:40,162 --> 01:11:41,493
I screwed up, okay?

1759
01:11:41,563 --> 01:11:42,154
I'm sorry.

1760
01:11:42,231 --> 01:11:44,500
But how would you like to spend
the last few good years of your life

1761
01:11:44,535 --> 01:11:46,434
with someone who's always unhappy?

1762
01:11:46,502 --> 01:11:48,299
Who does nothing
but live in the past?

1763
01:11:48,370 --> 01:11:50,031
Who can only complain
about all the rotten things

1764
01:11:50,105 --> 01:11:51,105
that happened to her,

1765
01:11:51,140 --> 01:11:54,234
even though really nothing
bad ever happened to you

1766
01:11:54,343 --> 01:11:56,311
except expecting too much.

1767
01:11:56,378 --> 01:11:57,777
You think I wanted
a wife like June Allyson

1768
01:11:57,880 --> 01:11:59,541
from Strategic Air Command?!

1769
01:11:59,615 --> 01:12:00,582
Well, guess what?

1770
01:12:00,649 --> 01:12:03,641
You won; t have to put up with
June Allyson anymore.

1771
01:12:03,786 --> 01:12:08,052
I'll live at his house the rest
of my goddamned life if I have to,

1772
01:12:08,123 --> 01:12:12,423
but I am through
with this marriage!

1773
01:12:35,417 --> 01:12:37,408
I need to talk to you, Marilyn.

1774
01:12:37,519 --> 01:12:38,986
She's not in
a real chatty today, dad.

1775
01:12:39,054 --> 01:12:41,887
You know, Gene,
it's probably not the good time.

1776
01:12:42,624 --> 01:12:45,422
Come on, that's my jacket.

1777
01:12:47,363 --> 01:12:48,921
- Though we
don't always understand

1778
01:12:48,997 --> 01:12:51,192
why we are taken
so soon from this life,

1779
01:12:51,266 --> 01:12:55,237
dear Lord, much less why we were
placed here to begin with,

1780
01:12:55,272 --> 01:12:59,196
we ask you bless this
service and this family.

1781
01:12:59,708 --> 01:13:01,573
And everybody said...

1782
01:13:01,810 --> 01:13:03,072
- Amen.
- Amen.

1783
01:13:03,145 --> 01:13:05,477
I've been asked by the
deceased's son to open the floor up

1784
01:13:05,547 --> 01:13:08,448
so that anyone would like to share
their thoughts about Helen.

1785
01:13:13,722 --> 01:13:15,212
And anyone at all

1786
01:13:26,668 --> 01:13:28,431
Hello everyone.

1787
01:13:28,604 --> 01:13:33,041
Uh, what can I say about
my grandma Helen?

1788
01:13:33,175 --> 01:13:37,874
Well, for one,
I remember how she was ma grandma

1789
01:13:38,213 --> 01:13:43,150
Also, she was a good pers...
. dresser.

1790
01:13:43,318 --> 01:13:48,153
She was a good dresser and she
owned some very nice jumpsuits.

1791
01:13:49,792 --> 01:13:53,387
I'll miss her very much. Thank you.

1792
01:13:56,965 --> 01:13:58,455
Thank you, son.

1793
01:13:58,534 --> 01:14:00,365
Anyone else?

1794
01:14:02,771 --> 01:14:05,296
Well, if there's no one else
would like to say anything...

1795
01:14:05,374 --> 01:14:06,306
I'd just like to...

1796
01:14:06,375 --> 01:14:08,843
I'd like to say something, please.

1797
01:14:09,311 --> 01:14:11,404
Oh, perfect.

1798
01:14:19,521 --> 01:14:21,455
For those of you who don't know me,

1799
01:14:21,557 --> 01:14:24,391
I'm Gene's wife, Marilyn.

1800
01:14:24,426 --> 01:14:26,360
Well, I'm right now,
but not for very long.

1801
01:14:26,428 --> 01:14:29,158
But that is not what
I wanted to talk about.

1802
01:14:29,264 --> 01:14:31,698
In all the years
I knew Helen Cooper,

1803
01:14:31,767 --> 01:14:33,325
she was never very nice to me.

1804
01:14:33,602 --> 01:14:35,035
She didn't think
I was very smart

1805
01:14:35,103 --> 01:14:37,003
and she said I talked too much.

1806
01:14:37,072 --> 01:14:41,873
Now I know that's a terrible
thing to say at someone's funeral,

1807
01:14:41,977 --> 01:14:46,004
but I spent a lot of time and
effort trying to make her like me,

1808
01:14:46,081 --> 01:14:47,776
and for what?

1809
01:14:47,883 --> 01:14:51,785
So she can make me feel bad,
Stick her nose up at me well?

1810
01:14:52,354 --> 01:14:55,084
I don't want to be just
tolerated anymore.

1811
01:14:55,190 --> 01:14:59,126
So I've decided that I'd rather
live the rest of my life alone

1812
01:14:59,495 --> 01:15:02,123
Instead of being
surrounded by strangers

1813
01:15:02,197 --> 01:15:04,461
who pretended they were my family.

1814
01:15:05,501 --> 01:15:07,366
I guess that's
a little off topic.

1815
01:15:07,469 --> 01:15:11,906
Anyway, I would like to say that
Helen had a lovely singing voice

1816
01:15:11,974 --> 01:15:13,703
and she was a very good cook.

1817
01:15:13,775 --> 01:15:15,970
Her holiday fudge
was second to none.

1818
01:15:17,346 --> 01:15:18,711
Thank you.

1819
01:15:22,150 --> 01:15:24,778
Well, that was... from the heart.

1820
01:15:25,921 --> 01:15:28,515
Is there anyone else who'd
like to speak at this time?

1821
01:15:28,924 --> 01:15:31,119
I'd like to add something.

1822
01:15:37,132 --> 01:15:39,902
I forgot to add that Helen
was born in Northern Florida

1823
01:15:39,937 --> 01:15:42,393
to migrant walnut farmers.

1824
01:15:42,638 --> 01:15:46,734
Also, if a certain somebody isn't
happy with her living situation,

1825
01:15:46,842 --> 01:15:50,403
or how she's apparently being
mistreated and ignored by her family,

1826
01:15:50,479 --> 01:15:53,312
said person can move out
any time she sees fit.

1827
01:15:54,082 --> 01:15:55,549
Helen's middle name was Esther.

1828
01:15:55,617 --> 01:15:56,948
Thank you.

1829
01:15:59,521 --> 01:16:00,249
Ah... well, if that's...

1830
01:16:00,322 --> 01:16:00,811
Well, alright, that's enough.

1831
01:16:00,889 --> 01:16:02,356
Sit down, Gene

1832
01:16:05,160 --> 01:16:06,752
I would like to correct
the previous speaker

1833
01:16:06,862 --> 01:16:09,296
who said Helen was
born to walnut farmers.

1834
01:16:09,364 --> 01:16:12,697
The truth is Helen was born to
cashew farmers.

1835
01:16:12,801 --> 01:16:15,150
The previous speaker
gets a lot of his facts wrong.

1836
01:16:15,185 --> 01:16:17,499
He can also be very self-absorbed
and immature.

1837
01:16:17,606 --> 01:16:18,705
Just ask his wife and

1838
01:16:18,740 --> 01:16:20,298
She'll tell you the same thing.

1839
01:16:20,642 --> 01:16:23,406
Helen's favorite color was yellow.

1840
01:16:29,785 --> 01:16:31,451
Actually, it was walnut farmers.

1841
01:16:31,486 --> 01:16:33,466
They can't even grow
cashews in Northern Florida

1842
01:16:33,501 --> 01:16:35,446
because of the freezing
winter temperatures.

1843
01:16:35,557 --> 01:16:37,491
A second grader
could tell you that.

1844
01:16:37,593 --> 01:16:39,185
A second grader
could also tell you

1845
01:16:39,294 --> 01:16:42,263
that you shouldn't treat your
twenty-nine year old son-Thirty-two!

1846
01:16:42,331 --> 01:16:45,266
Like a child and criticize him
for having greasy hair,

1847
01:16:45,334 --> 01:16:48,633
when he uses moisturizing
shampoo on a regular basis,

1848
01:16:48,704 --> 01:16:50,472
then dump all your selfish
problems on him

1849
01:16:50,507 --> 01:16:52,531
and expect him to be sympathetic.

1850
01:16:52,641 --> 01:16:55,075
Especially if he's been held
hostage in your never-ending,

1851
01:16:55,143 --> 01:16:55,939
jiggity-jiggity,

1852
01:16:56,011 --> 01:16:57,842
I'm so-insanely-happy-but
desperately lonely madhouse for

1853
01:16:57,913 --> 01:17:01,906
so long that he's starting to wear
underwear four sizes too small.

1854
01:17:01,984 --> 01:17:04,953
It sticks his balls
against the microwave!

1855
01:17:10,659 --> 01:17:14,755
Helen stood five foot six and
loved playing checkers.

1856
01:17:20,168 --> 01:17:23,535
I'm sure we can all agree Helen
was an outstanding checkers player.

1857
01:17:23,605 --> 01:17:24,940
You want to be mad at me?

1858
01:17:24,975 --> 01:17:26,601
I'm mad at me, too.

1859
01:17:27,442 --> 01:17:31,105
I've spent my life trying to do
what was right for everyone else,

1860
01:17:31,213 --> 01:17:33,807
trying to be who
I was expected to be.

1861
01:17:33,882 --> 01:17:35,951
Except the real me
wasn't the person

1862
01:17:35,986 --> 01:17:37,486
I ended up becoming.

1863
01:17:37,521 --> 01:17:38,986
And now I'm sixty.

1864
01:17:42,124 --> 01:17:44,854
And the only thing that's
saved me in my whole life,

1865
01:17:44,926 --> 01:17:49,863
Is that when I look at you
I'm worth something.

1866
01:17:51,166 --> 01:17:53,430
I talk to you and I feel good.

1867
01:17:53,535 --> 01:17:55,059
I look at you.

1868
01:17:56,338 --> 01:17:58,272
My life matters.

1869
01:17:59,408 --> 01:18:01,308
So if I needed you more
than you needed me

1870
01:18:01,376 --> 01:18:03,537
and that was too much to bear,

1871
01:18:04,112 --> 01:18:06,046
then I'm terribly sorry.

1872
01:18:06,114 --> 01:18:12,417
But, sweetie, you're my son.

1873
01:18:13,555 --> 01:18:16,456
And until you have
one of your own,

1874
01:18:16,858 --> 01:18:21,454
you can't imagine
the extraordinary person

1875
01:18:21,697 --> 01:18:27,192
who is going to come out of
your own imperfections.

1876
01:18:44,019 --> 01:18:47,250
The deceased's son has asked me

1877
01:18:47,322 --> 01:18:50,257
To play Helen's favorite song.

1878
01:19:11,480 --> 01:19:13,380
Mom, I got to go.

1879
01:19:51,586 --> 01:19:53,679
Hi, I need to see Clare.

1880
01:19:53,789 --> 01:19:55,279
It's really important.

1881
01:19:55,457 --> 01:19:58,255
She said she would call you
when she's ready to talk.

1882
01:19:58,593 --> 01:20:00,151
Besides,
I'm hosting a baby shower.

1883
01:20:00,228 --> 01:20:02,753
Look, Holly, I know you and
I have never seen eye to eye,

1884
01:20:02,831 --> 01:20:04,662
but I'm asking you
as a semi-human being to

1885
01:20:04,733 --> 01:20:06,792
please let me in his house.

1886
01:20:07,135 --> 01:20:08,363
Thank you.

1887
01:20:29,391 --> 01:20:32,554
Hi, I was just
looking for my wife.

1888
01:20:32,627 --> 01:20:33,719
There she is.

1889
01:20:33,795 --> 01:20:35,660
Can we talk for a minute, Sweetie?

1890
01:20:37,365 --> 01:20:39,833
Clare, Clare, please.

1891
01:20:39,935 --> 01:20:40,765
I need to talk to you.

1892
01:20:40,836 --> 01:20:41,668
Need, need.

1893
01:20:41,703 --> 01:20:43,136
Tell me more about what you need.

1894
01:20:43,171 --> 01:20:45,639
Okay, I deserve that,
but would you please hear me out?

1895
01:20:45,707 --> 01:20:46,139
Please

1896
01:20:46,474 --> 01:20:47,702
I'm sorry.

1897
01:20:47,809 --> 01:20:48,660
What are you doing?!

1898
01:20:48,695 --> 01:20:49,511
You stopped really fast.

1899
01:20:49,546 --> 01:20:50,136
I didn't try.

1900
01:20:50,212 --> 01:20:51,947
Alright, whatever
you're going to say,

1901
01:20:51,982 --> 01:20:53,175
Just spit it out.

1902
01:20:53,248 --> 01:20:55,216
OK, I know we haven't been
getting along great on last night,

1903
01:20:55,283 --> 01:20:56,750
and I don't want to
get into whose fault

1904
01:20:56,785 --> 01:20:58,719
it is especially Myron's not here
to defend himself-

1905
01:20:58,787 --> 01:20:59,276
Oh, No.

1906
01:20:59,354 --> 01:21:00,116
No, no, OK

1907
01:21:00,188 --> 01:21:01,780
Ok, alright,

1908
01:21:01,857 --> 01:21:05,190
some of it's, most of it moving
towards all of it is my fault.

1909
01:21:05,660 --> 01:21:07,127
Honesty Zone?

1910
01:21:08,063 --> 01:21:08,927
Fine.

1911
01:21:08,997 --> 01:21:10,123
Okay.

1912
01:21:13,268 --> 01:21:14,501
Well?

1913
01:21:14,536 --> 01:21:15,969
Oh, you want me to start?

1914
01:21:16,071 --> 01:21:16,435
Noah

1915
01:21:16,972 --> 01:21:18,030
No, OK, please

1916
01:21:18,106 --> 01:21:19,073
Please, please, please, please

1917
01:21:19,140 --> 01:21:22,041
I just, I wish I could take
this whole week back,

1918
01:21:22,377 --> 01:21:23,605
But I can't.

1919
01:21:24,112 --> 01:21:26,012
And I know, I know.

1920
01:21:26,248 --> 01:21:26,873
You're married to a guy

1921
01:21:26,948 --> 01:21:29,712
who can't have a real
conversation with his mom and dad.

1922
01:21:30,151 --> 01:21:32,949
A guy sneaks around,
snapping one off before sex

1923
01:21:33,021 --> 01:21:34,181
I get it

1924
01:21:34,256 --> 01:21:35,555
It says that he's
telling you that

1925
01:21:35,590 --> 01:21:38,388
He does feel completely
inadequate to be a father.

1926
01:21:38,760 --> 01:21:40,387
But you're not inadequate.

1927
01:21:40,495 --> 01:21:42,156
That's what's so stupid.

1928
01:21:42,230 --> 01:21:44,027
Would you shut up?

1929
01:21:45,333 --> 01:21:46,766
I mean the geese, sweet heart.

1930
01:21:46,801 --> 01:21:49,565
Honey, you say that now,
but what about in thirty years?

1931
01:21:49,905 --> 01:21:52,066
I just see all these things
my parents go on through

1932
01:21:52,140 --> 01:21:53,437
We're not your parents.

1933
01:21:53,541 --> 01:21:56,203
But at some point they
loved each other as we are,

1934
01:21:56,278 --> 01:21:58,246
and something went wrong.

1935
01:21:58,346 --> 01:22:00,177
I just don't want
that to happen to us,

1936
01:22:00,282 --> 01:22:02,876
I made a huge mistake.

1937
01:22:03,118 --> 01:22:05,313
I hurt you, and I'm sorry.

1938
01:22:06,454 --> 01:22:07,944
And I'm lame.

1939
01:22:08,189 --> 01:22:10,419
And I suck, too.

1940
01:22:10,792 --> 01:22:12,783
You hurt me so much.

1941
01:22:13,795 --> 01:22:17,788
Now you just show up here
and say you're sorry

1942
01:22:17,866 --> 01:22:19,766
And you want me just
to say everything's OK

1943
01:22:19,834 --> 01:22:21,336
It doesn't feel Ok

1944
01:22:21,371 --> 01:22:21,701
I know.

1945
01:22:21,736 --> 01:22:23,931
I don't want to believe me,
either.

1946
01:22:24,139 --> 01:22:25,834
But today my mom actually said

1947
01:22:25,907 --> 01:22:28,603
that I'm the only thing in her
life that she doesn't regret

1948
01:22:29,210 --> 01:22:30,234
Which floored me,

1949
01:22:30,312 --> 01:22:33,839
because I didn't think she was
thrilled with how I turned out.

1950
01:22:33,949 --> 01:22:36,577
But apparently I'm not that bad.

1951
01:22:36,685 --> 01:22:38,175
So if my parents

1952
01:22:38,420 --> 01:22:42,288
can produce this rousing success
story then I have to think you

1953
01:22:42,357 --> 01:22:44,348
and I could make one of our own.

1954
01:22:45,560 --> 01:22:48,290
And I don't want to
miss out on that?

1955
01:22:48,430 --> 01:22:51,194
What kind of idiot would
miss out on that?

1956
01:22:54,402 --> 01:22:56,393
Not this idiot.

1957
01:23:09,084 --> 01:23:10,551
No more toddler briefs.

1958
01:23:10,652 --> 01:23:12,210
I'm wearing the big undies now.

1959
01:23:12,287 --> 01:23:13,186
The cavity is large.

1960
01:23:13,221 --> 01:23:14,415
And you know that it's right.

1961
01:23:21,596 --> 01:23:23,530
Shut up!

1962
01:23:33,541 --> 01:23:34,872
Is something burning?

1963
01:23:35,010 --> 01:23:38,639
Hey, it's Noah and Clare Cooper!

1964
01:23:38,980 --> 01:23:40,914
It's like JeeJeeChung here.

1965
01:23:40,982 --> 01:23:43,507
It looks like somebody kissed
and made up.

1966
01:23:43,785 --> 01:23:47,277
Looks like they did
a bit more than that.

1967
01:23:47,622 --> 01:23:48,611
Join us!

1968
01:23:49,724 --> 01:23:50,748
Yeah, Sit down.

1969
01:23:50,859 --> 01:23:51,416
Come over here.

1970
01:23:51,526 --> 01:23:54,893
We're just taking some
like little green medicine.

1971
01:23:54,963 --> 01:23:56,863
You know, that green medicine

1972
01:23:56,931 --> 01:23:59,627
Yeah, since when
do you smoke green medicine?

1973
01:23:59,701 --> 01:24:02,499
You don't think that's all we do
in the Pain Pal, do you?

1974
01:24:02,670 --> 01:24:05,366
You think that all we do is
talk about our problems?

1975
01:24:05,507 --> 01:24:07,099
We're about action, man.

1976
01:24:08,109 --> 01:24:09,770
Because the herb is a blessing.

1977
01:24:09,878 --> 01:24:11,311
Such a blessing.

1978
01:24:11,379 --> 01:24:12,368
So...

1979
01:24:12,447 --> 01:24:13,505
It's a bomb.

1980
01:24:13,581 --> 01:24:14,138
Yeah

1981
01:24:14,215 --> 01:24:16,583
So Clare and I were
talking on the way home,

1982
01:24:16,618 --> 01:24:19,553
and we want you to know that you
both are welcomed to stay with us.

1983
01:24:19,621 --> 01:24:20,588
AS long as you need to.

1984
01:24:20,623 --> 01:24:21,612
That's nice.

1985
01:24:21,689 --> 01:24:22,553
But you know what?

1986
01:24:22,690 --> 01:24:23,690
We don't need that though.

1987
01:24:23,725 --> 01:24:27,217
No, no, we are moving in together.

1988
01:24:27,495 --> 01:24:28,086
You're what?

1989
01:24:28,163 --> 01:24:31,792
Yes, we both need a place and we
really enjoy each other's company,

1990
01:24:31,866 --> 01:24:33,834
so we thought, hey, why not?

1991
01:24:33,902 --> 01:24:35,130
Yeah!

1992
01:24:35,203 --> 01:24:36,795
You only know
each other for four days.

1993
01:24:36,871 --> 01:24:38,463
I think it's a good idea.

1994
01:24:38,540 --> 01:24:41,202
And I called my parents and
they're really excited.

1995
01:24:41,276 --> 01:24:44,268
That they're giving me some seed
money and my very own credit card.

1996
01:24:44,345 --> 01:24:45,141
Yes

1997
01:24:45,213 --> 01:24:46,612
I never had one

1998
01:24:46,681 --> 01:24:47,380
I'm surprised.

1999
01:24:47,415 --> 01:24:48,609
Where are you going to stay?

2000
01:24:48,683 --> 01:24:51,481
We'll sack out down of the
Downtowner for a few days

2001
01:24:51,553 --> 01:24:54,386
And we're also
collaborating on a screenplay

2002
01:24:54,456 --> 01:24:56,981
about diabetic vampires.

2003
01:24:57,058 --> 01:24:58,038
Yes, listen to this.

2004
01:24:58,073 --> 01:24:59,018
Do you like the title?

2005
01:24:59,694 --> 01:25:01,161
Blood Sugar.

2006
01:25:01,429 --> 01:25:01,986
It's true.

2007
01:25:02,063 --> 01:25:03,264
Oh, I get it.

2008
01:25:03,299 --> 01:25:04,356
Right?

2009
01:25:04,432 --> 01:25:06,263
I can't believe he's thirty-two.

2010
01:25:06,534 --> 01:25:07,501
I know. I know.

2011
01:25:07,569 --> 01:25:08,729
What?

2012
01:25:09,904 --> 01:25:13,362
I really should have told him.

2013
01:25:13,475 --> 01:25:14,567
I'm an old person.

2014
01:25:14,642 --> 01:25:16,337
Do you like old people?

2015
01:25:21,015 --> 01:25:21,709
Alright, thanks.

2016
01:25:21,783 --> 01:25:22,181
You're welcome.

2017
01:25:22,417 --> 01:25:23,941
Thanks for sharing
your home with me.

2018
01:25:24,018 --> 01:25:25,007
Anytime.

2019
01:25:26,054 --> 01:25:27,919
You're a special person.

2020
01:25:28,056 --> 01:25:30,354
And I don't mean the kind
that wears a helmet.

2021
01:25:30,692 --> 01:25:31,454
It's cool.

2022
01:25:31,526 --> 01:25:33,289
You should put that in your PTSD.

2023
01:25:33,428 --> 01:25:34,292
Actually I already

2024
01:25:34,362 --> 01:25:35,761
Thanks for everything, Sweetie.

2025
01:25:36,030 --> 01:25:37,224
It's an adventure.

2026
01:25:37,298 --> 01:25:40,165
Let me know if you guys make me
a grandkid, alright?

2027
01:25:40,802 --> 01:25:41,801
I'll stay on top of it.

2028
01:25:41,836 --> 01:25:44,430
Yeah, if you do, don't drink
too much in the first trimester.

2029
01:25:44,572 --> 01:25:46,733
That's where I went wrong
with Noah, I think.

2030
01:25:46,808 --> 01:25:47,291
But any...

2031
01:25:47,326 --> 01:25:48,079
Bye, Clare.

2032
01:25:48,114 --> 01:25:48,833
Bye, Myron

2033
01:25:48,910 --> 01:25:50,002
Hey,

2034
01:25:52,013 --> 01:25:53,674
I don't know what to say.

2035
01:25:53,815 --> 01:25:56,317
Just hug as hard as we can
and call it a week?

2036
01:25:56,352 --> 01:25:57,011
I can do that.

2037
01:25:57,085 --> 01:25:58,518
OK.

2038
01:25:58,786 --> 01:25:59,753
I love you.

2039
01:25:59,821 --> 01:26:01,311
I love you, too.

2040
01:26:02,157 --> 01:26:04,887
One day, we'll worked out
all these stuff.

2041
01:26:05,927 --> 01:26:07,519
Probably not.

2042
01:26:08,930 --> 01:26:09,453
OK

2043
01:26:09,531 --> 01:26:10,327
Alright

2044
01:26:10,398 --> 01:26:11,296
Alright, Hartato.

2045
01:26:11,766 --> 01:26:13,757
There are long roads in the colon.

2046
01:27:07,021 --> 01:27:09,785
Marilyn and Myron
are out right now,

2047
01:27:09,891 --> 01:27:12,121
so please leave a message.

2048
01:27:13,294 --> 01:27:14,852
Hi, it's your son.

2049
01:27:14,929 --> 01:27:17,591
I know you're probably
at work right now,

2050
01:27:18,099 --> 01:27:19,067
I just call and say hi.

2051
01:27:19,102 --> 01:27:20,625
Call me back.

2052
01:27:20,935 --> 01:27:22,368
I think you have class tonight

2053
01:27:22,437 --> 01:27:24,462
But, anyway,
I Just called and say that

2054
01:27:24,539 --> 01:27:26,632
I hired a hand
and wrist specialist

2055
01:27:26,708 --> 01:27:28,505
So next time when
you come into my office

2056
01:27:28,576 --> 01:27:29,065
hang on a sec

2057
01:27:29,143 --> 01:27:30,872
dad's in a standoff with Ian.

2058
01:27:30,945 --> 01:27:32,579
He keeps winging his mac
and cheese at me.

2059
01:27:32,614 --> 01:27:35,447
Eat your lunch, monkey,
don't throw it at grandpa.

2060
01:27:36,351 --> 01:27:38,285
Honey,
why's the phone off the hook?

2061
01:27:38,386 --> 01:27:39,910
Can you come down here please?

2062
01:27:39,988 --> 01:27:41,289
I've got it under control.

2063
01:27:41,324 --> 01:27:41,755
Honey, what?

2064
01:27:41,823 --> 01:27:42,755
You don't have it under control.

2065
01:27:42,824 --> 01:27:43,552
He throws mac and cheese at you.

2066
01:27:43,625 --> 01:27:44,887
Honey, who's on the phone?

2067
01:27:44,959 --> 01:27:45,825
Sweetie

2068
01:27:45,860 --> 01:27:46,849
Hello? Hello?

2069
01:27:46,928 --> 01:27:48,293
Clare! Clare Bear!

2070
01:27:48,363 --> 01:27:51,332
Alright, mommy's here to rescue.
