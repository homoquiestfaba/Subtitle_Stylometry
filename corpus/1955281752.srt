1
00:00:00,601 --> 00:00:05,139
(serene music)

2
00:00:22,456 --> 00:00:27,428
(anticipating music)

3
00:03:21,802 --> 00:03:24,972
[Voiceover] My name is Jack
Deth and I'm a Trancer Hunter,

4
00:03:24,972 --> 00:03:27,275
I work in Los
Angeles, California.

5
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:32,280
In the year 2360, at least I
did until I traveled through

6
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:34,915
time to singe a Trancer
nutcase who was running wild

7
00:03:34,915 --> 00:03:37,184
on the streets of old L.A.

8
00:03:37,184 --> 00:03:39,453
Now I'm struck in
the City of Angels.

9
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:41,722
And that's not too bad.

10
00:03:41,722 --> 00:03:43,857
I found a girl and
work as a private eye.

11
00:03:45,058 --> 00:03:46,927
But I'm still the future
cop with no Trancers

12
00:03:46,927 --> 00:03:49,463
to burn and no new
cases in sight.

13
00:03:50,831 --> 00:03:55,503
(laughing)
(frolicking music)

14
00:03:55,503 --> 00:03:57,070
That's right folks, it's
time to take advantage

15
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:59,973
of our holiday rates of Jack
Deth's Detective Agency,

16
00:03:59,973 --> 00:04:03,377
if you need to check up
on your spouse, do it now!

17
00:04:03,377 --> 00:04:05,679
Because I won't take a fee
unless I catch him in the act,

18
00:04:05,679 --> 00:04:08,215
and until January one
we'll throw in a free

19
00:04:08,215 --> 00:04:11,552
court-admissible video
tape of the transgressors.

20
00:04:11,552 --> 00:04:14,655
So, give Jack Deth a call.

21
00:04:14,655 --> 00:04:17,591
Remember, I'm on your side.

22
00:04:17,591 --> 00:04:21,529
Happy Holidays
and Feliz Navidad.

23
00:04:22,463 --> 00:04:23,597
(gun fires)

24
00:04:23,597 --> 00:04:25,899
(shouting in foreign language)

25
00:04:25,899 --> 00:04:27,200
I hate that show!

26
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:30,037
(shouting in foreign language)

27
00:04:30,037 --> 00:04:31,004
Get your hands up!

28
00:04:31,004 --> 00:04:35,876
(shouting in foreign language)

29
00:04:41,181 --> 00:04:46,153
(speaking in foreign language)

30
00:04:49,357 --> 00:04:51,258
Shit, what did you
do to this thing?

31
00:04:51,258 --> 00:04:53,994
(speaking in foreign language)

32
00:04:54,928 --> 00:04:55,796
(shouting in foreign language)

33
00:04:55,796 --> 00:04:59,700
(low noise humming)

34
00:05:08,542 --> 00:05:10,243
(glass shattering)

35
00:05:10,243 --> 00:05:12,012
Holy Christ, what is that?

36
00:05:12,012 --> 00:05:16,717
(electricity crackling)

37
00:05:19,987 --> 00:05:21,589
(shouting in foreign language)

38
00:05:26,794 --> 00:05:31,799
(foreboding music)

39
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:39,006
Where's Jack Deth?

40
00:05:43,744 --> 00:05:46,547
The information coordinates
indicate that Jack Deth

41
00:05:46,547 --> 00:05:49,417
is in Paradise, where is he?

42
00:05:49,417 --> 00:05:51,852
(gun fires)

43
00:05:53,587 --> 00:05:57,691
(speaking in foreign language)

44
00:05:58,892 --> 00:06:00,828
(scuffling)

45
00:06:02,696 --> 00:06:06,133
Jack Deth, (mumbling),
you know High Paradise?

46
00:06:06,133 --> 00:06:09,737
Jack Deth, (speaking
in foreign language).

47
00:06:13,707 --> 00:06:15,208
[Jack] Lena, all I
need is a couple of hours

48
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:18,446
to nail this son of a bitch
and my case is closed.

49
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:22,450
I thought we agreed
on a clean break, right?

50
00:06:23,651 --> 00:06:26,353
Jack, I have to go, Robert's
here to discuss the settlement.

51
00:06:26,353 --> 00:06:29,022
Robert, geez, aren't
we lucky enough to have

52
00:06:29,022 --> 00:06:30,958
a divorce lawyer
right next door.

53
00:06:30,958 --> 00:06:32,460
Don't do that.

54
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:35,028
This isn't the greatest
Christmas present I've ever had.

55
00:06:35,028 --> 00:06:36,196
What's the hurry?

56
00:06:36,196 --> 00:06:37,865
I don't wanna drag this on.

57
00:06:37,865 --> 00:06:40,067
If I don't collect the
fee, there won't be enough

58
00:06:40,067 --> 00:06:42,202
of a settlement for Bob
to sink his teeth into,

59
00:06:42,202 --> 00:06:43,136
you got that?

60
00:06:43,136 --> 00:06:45,138
Fine, do what you need to do.

61
00:06:45,138 --> 00:06:46,474
Lena, after this I
could back away from

62
00:06:46,474 --> 00:06:48,341
the detective crap for a
while, give us a chance

63
00:06:48,341 --> 00:06:50,077
to get back on track.

64
00:06:50,077 --> 00:06:51,779
You know it's not that
simple, there are a lot of

65
00:06:51,779 --> 00:06:54,381
things wrong, not
just your work.

66
00:06:55,716 --> 00:06:57,485
I gotta start somewhere.

67
00:06:58,285 --> 00:07:01,288
Look angel, I wanna
make the effort.

68
00:07:01,288 --> 00:07:03,390
I've heard that a thousand
times, and you never seem

69
00:07:03,390 --> 00:07:05,493
to get around to doing it.

70
00:07:05,493 --> 00:07:07,160
Lena, I mean it this time.

71
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:09,930
Meat me at Emilio's,
make reservations okay?

72
00:07:10,498 --> 00:07:11,699
I don't know.

73
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:13,534
Come on.

74
00:07:13,534 --> 00:07:15,503
Quiet dinner with your husband?

75
00:07:15,503 --> 00:07:17,104
You've had sleazier
offers than that,

76
00:07:17,104 --> 00:07:19,039
most of them from
me, what do you say?

77
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:21,975
Eight o'clock, and
you'd better be there.

78
00:07:21,975 --> 00:07:23,611
Now try and stop me.

79
00:07:24,077 --> 00:07:28,281
Corner table, hey listen,
send Bob home will ya?

80
00:07:44,231 --> 00:07:46,600
Man, sporty, graying
at the temples,

81
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:48,435
girl's cutting about 16.

82
00:07:48,435 --> 00:07:50,403
Which means your
ass is grass pal.

83
00:07:50,403 --> 00:07:52,205
Don't bother me, I'm reading.

84
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:54,942
Merry Christmas.

85
00:08:18,331 --> 00:08:19,767
Lena's right.

86
00:08:20,167 --> 00:08:23,436
Singeing Trancers has more
dignity than this shit.

87
00:08:24,404 --> 00:08:28,141
(foreboding music)

88
00:08:28,141 --> 00:08:29,476
What the hell are you?

89
00:08:29,476 --> 00:08:31,712
No physicality is
identical to the description

90
00:08:31,712 --> 00:08:33,581
that was fed to me.

91
00:08:34,114 --> 00:08:37,585
If you could possibly be
someone's pissed off husband,

92
00:08:37,585 --> 00:08:40,287
I'm only doing my job pal,
you better call your old lady.

93
00:08:40,287 --> 00:08:42,255
You are Jack Deth.

94
00:08:42,255 --> 00:08:43,757
Well you got that
part right, Godzilla,

95
00:08:43,757 --> 00:08:46,026
now what the hell do
you want with me, huh?

96
00:08:46,026 --> 00:08:47,628
(humming)

97
00:08:47,628 --> 00:08:49,429
(screaming)

98
00:08:54,301 --> 00:08:59,306
(anticipating music)

99
00:09:05,145 --> 00:09:06,346
[Girl] I got it.

100
00:09:16,323 --> 00:09:17,858
Okay pops, tell me
again what happened,

101
00:09:17,858 --> 00:09:19,960
and this time in English okay?

102
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:23,631
(speaking foreign language)

103
00:09:23,631 --> 00:09:25,933
Hey fish face, where's
the costume party?

104
00:09:26,834 --> 00:09:27,901
Hey!

105
00:09:27,901 --> 00:09:29,202
Oh yeah, I'm talking to you.

106
00:09:29,202 --> 00:09:30,203
Ugh!

107
00:09:30,203 --> 00:09:34,775
(foreboding music)

108
00:09:38,679 --> 00:09:43,416
(electricity crackling)

109
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:16,249
Hey, take it easy, I
got a little TCL lag here.

110
00:10:16,917 --> 00:10:18,085
This is a hell of an adjustment.

111
00:10:18,085 --> 00:10:20,020
Adjust to the adjustment.

112
00:10:23,724 --> 00:10:24,524
(gun cocks)

113
00:10:37,537 --> 00:10:42,409
(anticipating music)

114
00:10:43,677 --> 00:10:44,878
(gun cocks)

115
00:11:03,030 --> 00:11:05,365
You're a big man
around here, Godzilla.

116
00:11:05,365 --> 00:11:06,800
I'm impressed.

117
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:09,502
Compared to you
I'm big everywhere.

118
00:11:09,502 --> 00:11:10,738
I don't know
what you need more,

119
00:11:10,738 --> 00:11:12,539
a personality or a
bullet in the head.

120
00:11:12,539 --> 00:11:14,775
I've already had a
bullet in the head.

121
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:24,384
(coughing)

122
00:11:28,889 --> 00:11:29,957
Shit.

123
00:11:29,957 --> 00:11:34,762
(foreboding music)
(coughing)

124
00:12:11,664 --> 00:12:13,200
[Wounded warrior] Got a smoke?

125
00:12:23,376 --> 00:12:26,446
(coughing)

126
00:12:26,446 --> 00:12:27,981
That's the best I can do,

127
00:12:27,981 --> 00:12:29,817
start him on whole plasma,
if he doesn't come around

128
00:12:29,817 --> 00:12:32,119
in a couple of
hours, cut him off.

129
00:12:32,119 --> 00:12:32,820
[Assistant] But Dr. Raines!

130
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:34,187
Just save it.

131
00:12:34,187 --> 00:12:35,889
We're short on supplies
and I can't afford to waste

132
00:12:35,889 --> 00:12:38,425
plasma on a trooper who's
not going to make it.

133
00:12:41,428 --> 00:12:43,396
[Android] Jack
Deth, as ordered.

134
00:12:45,132 --> 00:12:46,967
Welcome to hell, Jack.

135
00:12:46,967 --> 00:12:48,501
What's going on here Ruthie?

136
00:12:48,501 --> 00:12:51,438
Oh I decided to
redecorate my old lab, Jack.

137
00:12:51,438 --> 00:12:54,407
So how's the 20th
century, nice and comfy?

138
00:12:54,407 --> 00:12:55,843
My head feels like
it's been in the blender,

139
00:12:55,843 --> 00:12:57,277
talk to me!

140
00:12:57,710 --> 00:13:00,480
Let's just say we've had
a few Trancer problems.

141
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,282
Is that why finhead here
Shanghai'd me up the line

142
00:13:02,282 --> 00:13:03,350
in the TCL Chamber?

143
00:13:03,350 --> 00:13:05,752
(alarm buzzing)

144
00:13:05,752 --> 00:13:07,420
Get out of the way
Jack, keep quiet,

145
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:08,889
somebody just busted security

146
00:13:08,889 --> 00:13:10,623
and the council needs you alive.

147
00:13:10,623 --> 00:13:12,192
Save your ammo,
Ruthie, you always were

148
00:13:12,192 --> 00:13:13,526
a lousy shot.

149
00:13:14,061 --> 00:13:15,195
Hold your fire!

150
00:13:15,628 --> 00:13:17,264
It's us, don't shoot.

151
00:13:17,264 --> 00:13:20,633
(anticipating music)

152
00:13:20,633 --> 00:13:22,102
Sorry we set off the code red.

153
00:13:22,102 --> 00:13:24,237
I almost wasted you
as a Trancer, pal.

154
00:13:24,237 --> 00:13:25,138
We didn't have any choice,

155
00:13:25,138 --> 00:13:26,373
the back's full of Trancers.

156
00:13:26,373 --> 00:13:27,875
A full battalion?

157
00:13:27,875 --> 00:13:29,676
Yeah, an attack patrol on
S&D mission to find normals,

158
00:13:29,676 --> 00:13:31,144
they're sweeping every
building on the block.

159
00:13:31,144 --> 00:13:33,613
They got all the fire out
the gazoo for the mop-up.

160
00:13:33,613 --> 00:13:35,015
I want you to cover
the front entrance,

161
00:13:35,015 --> 00:13:36,583
if they make any
advance, signal red,

162
00:13:36,583 --> 00:13:37,951
and beat it the hell back here.

163
00:13:37,951 --> 00:13:39,619
I don't need
anymore dead heroes.

164
00:13:39,619 --> 00:13:40,888
Yes colonel.

165
00:13:41,354 --> 00:13:42,890
Colonel?

166
00:13:43,790 --> 00:13:45,258
There have been a hell of
a lot of changes around here,

167
00:13:45,258 --> 00:13:47,794
Jack, how ya been?

168
00:13:50,497 --> 00:13:51,899
You better hold up
on the family reunion

169
00:13:51,899 --> 00:13:52,933
if you want me to save this man,

170
00:13:52,933 --> 00:13:54,902
get the surgical tray, colonel,

171
00:13:54,902 --> 00:13:56,303
nail his bed still.

172
00:13:56,303 --> 00:13:57,938
Let's take a walk, Jack.

173
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:06,914
Do you smoke?

174
00:14:06,914 --> 00:14:08,081
Yeah.

175
00:14:08,481 --> 00:14:10,383
I know this is a hell
of a place to meet.

176
00:14:11,985 --> 00:14:14,787
I'm Harris, the ranking officer.

177
00:14:14,787 --> 00:14:15,989
You're in command?

178
00:14:15,989 --> 00:14:18,191
Let's just say
I'm the final word,

179
00:14:18,191 --> 00:14:20,193
since McNulty bought it.

180
00:14:21,661 --> 00:14:23,096
When?

181
00:14:23,096 --> 00:14:25,732
In the first firefight,
he was leading an offensive

182
00:14:25,732 --> 00:14:27,234
into old L.A.

183
00:14:28,435 --> 00:14:30,303
He told me a lot about you.

184
00:14:32,072 --> 00:14:34,341
You're kind of a
legend around here.

185
00:14:34,341 --> 00:14:36,543
(foreboding music)

186
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:38,946
Yeah well I was
just another one

187
00:14:38,946 --> 00:14:40,647
of McNulty's troopers.

188
00:14:40,647 --> 00:14:42,749
You knew the war was coming.

189
00:14:42,749 --> 00:14:44,451
Well I kept
trying to warn him.

190
00:14:44,451 --> 00:14:45,852
But nobody would hear it.

191
00:14:45,852 --> 00:14:47,254
The cops were in control

192
00:14:47,254 --> 00:14:49,756
of the Trancers, hah.

193
00:14:49,756 --> 00:14:52,125
Then one morning we woke up,

194
00:14:52,125 --> 00:14:54,427
they were organized,
ready to fight.

195
00:14:55,528 --> 00:14:56,829
We weren't.

196
00:14:57,564 --> 00:14:59,732
How many Trancer's
asses did you singe?

197
00:15:00,233 --> 00:15:01,468
We lost count at 1,000,000,

198
00:15:01,468 --> 00:15:02,970
but they kept coming.

199
00:15:03,603 --> 00:15:05,705
The blood in the streets
was an inch deep.

200
00:15:06,739 --> 00:15:08,008
And at the end...

201
00:15:09,476 --> 00:15:12,245
I was putting
10-year-olds into combat.

202
00:15:14,747 --> 00:15:17,017
The council decides who
fights and who doesn't.

203
00:15:19,552 --> 00:15:21,221
I am the council, Jack.

204
00:15:22,355 --> 00:15:24,124
Everybody else is dead.

205
00:15:25,392 --> 00:15:26,693
Son of a bitch.

206
00:15:31,398 --> 00:15:33,033
But we're fighting back.

207
00:15:35,135 --> 00:15:36,903
Alice leads the underground.

208
00:15:37,737 --> 00:15:39,472
Being married to you was
the best basic training

209
00:15:39,472 --> 00:15:41,008
she could've gotten.

210
00:15:41,341 --> 00:15:42,842
Did you give him
his assignment?

211
00:15:42,842 --> 00:15:44,177
Not yet.

212
00:15:45,012 --> 00:15:47,147
Jack, I'm gonna send you

213
00:15:47,147 --> 00:15:50,117
back down the line to kill
the Trancers at their source.

214
00:15:50,117 --> 00:15:52,019
Find the son of a bitch
who started this thing

215
00:15:52,019 --> 00:15:53,520
and singe his ass.

216
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:56,456
That's top secret
information, nobody knows that.

217
00:15:58,791 --> 00:15:59,826
Lena knows.

218
00:15:59,826 --> 00:16:01,094
Lena?

219
00:16:01,094 --> 00:16:02,562
She wrote about it.

220
00:16:02,562 --> 00:16:05,065
All her early records
are lost, but trust me,

221
00:16:05,065 --> 00:16:06,499
she knows.

222
00:16:06,499 --> 00:16:08,635
Ah bullshit, she never
said anything to me about it.

223
00:16:08,635 --> 00:16:10,803
That's because she
didn't know in 1992,

224
00:16:10,803 --> 00:16:13,040
all her knowledge came later.

225
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:15,708
So we're sending you to 2005,

226
00:16:15,708 --> 00:16:17,644
when it all began.

227
00:16:22,115 --> 00:16:24,951
Nailing this trancing son of
a bitch won't be a cakewalk.

228
00:16:24,951 --> 00:16:26,953
Screw that, I'm still
a Trancer Hunter, Harris,

229
00:16:26,953 --> 00:16:28,588
but if you're worried about
it, let me take Godzilla

230
00:16:28,588 --> 00:16:30,090
down the line as my backup.

231
00:16:30,090 --> 00:16:32,059
No chance, Shark's
the last model

232
00:16:32,059 --> 00:16:34,261
of androids we built as
the first line of defense

233
00:16:34,261 --> 00:16:36,296
against the Trancers,
we need him here.

234
00:16:36,296 --> 00:16:38,465
I bet he does a
hell of a job too.

235
00:16:38,465 --> 00:16:40,667
Yeah, but we depleted
the last of the element

236
00:16:40,667 --> 00:16:42,602
we need for his power source.

237
00:16:42,602 --> 00:16:44,737
When Shark runs down, that's it.

238
00:16:44,737 --> 00:16:46,106
Instant junk.

239
00:16:46,106 --> 00:16:48,775
[Voiceover] Colonel,
colonel, colonel, incoming!

240
00:16:49,376 --> 00:16:53,880
(guns fire)

241
00:16:56,549 --> 00:16:57,750
I'm sticking with you Alice!

242
00:16:57,750 --> 00:17:01,388
(anticipating music)
(guns fire)

243
00:17:01,388 --> 00:17:03,656
Jack, we need you
down the line, go!

244
00:17:03,656 --> 00:17:04,357
Follow me!

245
00:17:04,357 --> 00:17:07,260
(guns fire)

246
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:09,196
(groans)

247
00:17:10,963 --> 00:17:15,768
(guns fire)

248
00:17:30,817 --> 00:17:32,552
(silenced gun fires)

249
00:17:33,453 --> 00:17:34,821
Catch your breath, Jack.

250
00:17:34,821 --> 00:17:36,123
If the Trancers don't
return their fire right away

251
00:17:36,123 --> 00:17:37,524
it means they're regrouping.

252
00:17:38,191 --> 00:17:39,626
We've got room to move.

253
00:17:40,127 --> 00:17:41,594
You're getting pretty
good at this shit, Alice.

254
00:17:42,629 --> 00:17:44,597
I know, I learned it from you.

255
00:17:45,865 --> 00:17:46,666
Let's move.

256
00:17:46,666 --> 00:17:51,138
(anticipating music)

257
00:18:00,513 --> 00:18:03,650
(guns fire)

258
00:18:03,650 --> 00:18:08,421
(helicopter blades rotating)

259
00:18:09,489 --> 00:18:14,026
(guns fire)

260
00:18:15,228 --> 00:18:19,031
(screaming)

261
00:18:21,668 --> 00:18:22,935
Harris gave me the coordinates.

262
00:18:22,935 --> 00:18:24,371
(beeping)

263
00:18:24,371 --> 00:18:25,972
Jack, if we don't make it...

264
00:18:25,972 --> 00:18:27,874
You'll see me again, Alice.

265
00:18:27,874 --> 00:18:28,975
You're the best thing
that has happened to me

266
00:18:28,975 --> 00:18:30,310
in two centuries.

267
00:18:31,344 --> 00:18:33,180
You better get to Lena.

268
00:18:36,249 --> 00:18:37,550
Go, go!

269
00:18:37,550 --> 00:18:42,355
(anticipating music)
(silenced gun fires)

270
00:18:42,355 --> 00:18:47,360
(electricity crackling)

271
00:18:55,402 --> 00:19:00,407
(rock music)

272
00:19:12,219 --> 00:19:14,086
Man, there ain't
nothing better than that.

273
00:19:14,987 --> 00:19:16,055
Do you hear me?

274
00:19:16,055 --> 00:19:17,290
Nothing in the whole world!

275
00:19:17,290 --> 00:19:18,891
(glass shattering)

276
00:19:18,891 --> 00:19:19,892
Let's go.

277
00:19:19,892 --> 00:19:21,228
You're getting too pumped.

278
00:19:21,228 --> 00:19:22,462
Where are we going?

279
00:19:22,462 --> 00:19:23,530
[Blond friend] Just
back to the others.

280
00:19:23,530 --> 00:19:24,764
Well what about the beer?

281
00:19:24,764 --> 00:19:26,233
[Blond friend] I got
the beer, let's go.

282
00:19:26,933 --> 00:19:27,667
Man!

283
00:19:28,067 --> 00:19:28,801
Wow!

284
00:19:31,871 --> 00:19:32,772
Oh man...

285
00:19:32,772 --> 00:19:34,274
Stevens, now.

286
00:19:34,907 --> 00:19:36,843
Bye baby! (Laughs)

287
00:19:36,843 --> 00:19:37,610
Wow!

288
00:19:37,610 --> 00:19:41,681
(crowd chattering)

289
00:19:42,915 --> 00:19:44,116
That girl really liked me.

290
00:19:44,116 --> 00:19:45,585
You don't make
enough money, private.

291
00:19:50,290 --> 00:19:52,959
Baby, I'm so hard a
cat couldn't scratch it.

292
00:19:52,959 --> 00:19:54,894
Come here and give me
some relief. (Laughs)

293
00:19:54,894 --> 00:19:56,463
Shift into low gear.

294
00:19:56,463 --> 00:19:58,665
You need to cool down.

295
00:19:58,665 --> 00:20:01,234
What the fuck do you
think she's here for anyway?

296
00:20:02,435 --> 00:20:04,304
Besides I ain't the
only one liking it.

297
00:20:04,304 --> 00:20:05,638
Right honey?

298
00:20:05,638 --> 00:20:06,873
Stevens.

299
00:20:06,873 --> 00:20:08,575
Next time I draw you in the pit,

300
00:20:08,575 --> 00:20:10,343
you're a dead man.

301
00:20:10,343 --> 00:20:12,612
Well excuse me for
telling the truth.

302
00:20:13,546 --> 00:20:15,848
You got your eye on
that new recruit anyway.

303
00:20:16,849 --> 00:20:18,351
How you feeling, squirt?

304
00:20:19,419 --> 00:20:20,820
Not so good.

305
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:23,155
The injection is still
making me feel kinda sick.

306
00:20:25,024 --> 00:20:28,261
You're getting stronger
by the hour, I can feel it.

307
00:20:28,261 --> 00:20:29,496
Hell you only been
in basic training

308
00:20:29,496 --> 00:20:31,764
three months, that's
still drug level one.

309
00:20:32,399 --> 00:20:34,601
Wait till you get to level
10 with them damn shots.

310
00:20:34,601 --> 00:20:35,968
You will be
Wonder-fucking-Woman.

311
00:20:35,968 --> 00:20:38,638
Stevens, one more word,

312
00:20:38,638 --> 00:20:40,540
I'll break your spine in half.

313
00:20:40,540 --> 00:20:44,577
(rowdy cheering)

314
00:20:48,381 --> 00:20:50,182
You think that you're
gonna join in the Corps?

315
00:20:51,318 --> 00:20:52,752
I'd love to, but,

316
00:20:53,786 --> 00:20:57,490
I don't know if my brother
thinks I'm soldier material yet.

317
00:20:58,024 --> 00:21:00,560
I thought I was,
real smart huh?

318
00:21:01,594 --> 00:21:04,464
Oh shit, these things
are going fast, wow.

319
00:21:06,399 --> 00:21:07,934
I'll be a son of a
bitch, look who came down

320
00:21:07,934 --> 00:21:10,236
of the farm and spend
a night on the town.

321
00:21:12,405 --> 00:21:14,507
[Voiceover] Hey
honey, shake that thing.

322
00:21:14,507 --> 00:21:15,642
I'm ready for some beers.

323
00:21:15,642 --> 00:21:17,243
Relatives of yours?

324
00:21:18,811 --> 00:21:20,212
The Corps is my
family now, baby.

325
00:21:20,212 --> 00:21:21,448
It's yours too.

326
00:21:21,981 --> 00:21:25,217
Them boys, they ain't
shit on my boots.

327
00:21:28,355 --> 00:21:30,189
You said it yourself,
lieutenant, I'm too pumped.

328
00:21:30,189 --> 00:21:31,824
Let me blow off a little steam.

329
00:21:31,824 --> 00:21:33,826
You stay in control.

330
00:21:33,826 --> 00:21:35,562
Broken bones only.

331
00:21:36,496 --> 00:21:38,531
Hell all I want is
a little exercise.

332
00:21:40,633 --> 00:21:45,372
(foreboding music)
(heaving)

333
00:21:57,850 --> 00:21:59,151
Are you gonna stop him?

334
00:21:59,151 --> 00:22:00,787
No baby brother.

335
00:22:01,921 --> 00:22:04,123
It might be good
for you to see this.

336
00:22:04,757 --> 00:22:06,393
How you boys doing tonight?

337
00:22:06,393 --> 00:22:08,761
Just fine jarhead,
how you doing?

338
00:22:10,397 --> 00:22:11,798
Yeah, if you're all here,

339
00:22:11,798 --> 00:22:13,400
I think your friends must
be getting kinda lonely.

340
00:22:14,033 --> 00:22:15,835
Which friends are
you talking about?

341
00:22:15,835 --> 00:22:17,637
All them goats and
pigs back on the farm

342
00:22:17,637 --> 00:22:19,271
you're used to buggering.

343
00:22:19,271 --> 00:22:21,240
(mumbling) smiling faces.

344
00:22:23,142 --> 00:22:25,412
Boy, you're one
ugly son of a bitch.

345
00:22:25,412 --> 00:22:26,979
(scuffling)

346
00:22:26,979 --> 00:22:29,281
(screaming)

347
00:22:29,281 --> 00:22:33,119
(anticipating music)

348
00:22:33,119 --> 00:22:36,489
(scuffling)

349
00:22:51,303 --> 00:22:52,439
Come on, asshole!

350
00:22:52,439 --> 00:22:57,143
(scuffling)
(anticipating music)

351
00:23:06,486 --> 00:23:08,087
[Lieutenant] Come
on Stevens that's it.

352
00:23:08,087 --> 00:23:09,689
Party's over, that's an order.

353
00:23:09,689 --> 00:23:10,923
Lieutenant.

354
00:23:13,493 --> 00:23:16,463
Sorry lieutenant,
I'm on a level 10 high.

355
00:23:16,463 --> 00:23:17,897
This isn't the pit.

356
00:23:18,865 --> 00:23:20,132
It is tonight.

357
00:23:22,268 --> 00:23:24,937
(groaning)

358
00:23:28,374 --> 00:23:31,077
Asshole, corner pocket.

359
00:23:32,745 --> 00:23:36,115
(anticipating music)

360
00:23:36,115 --> 00:23:37,049
[Voiceover] Look out!

361
00:23:37,049 --> 00:23:39,519
(screaming)
(glass breaking)

362
00:23:40,352 --> 00:23:41,988
Jesus Christ.

363
00:23:45,057 --> 00:23:47,259
That's the beauty of
being in the Corps, honey.

364
00:23:47,259 --> 00:23:48,795
You can do whatever
the fuck you want,

365
00:23:48,795 --> 00:23:50,597
and nobody is gonna stop you.

366
00:23:52,264 --> 00:23:53,866
You're finished, private.

367
00:23:54,834 --> 00:23:57,003
Come out of it, let
the trancing pass.

368
00:23:57,770 --> 00:24:00,139
You did a good job,
but we'll mop it up.

369
00:24:01,107 --> 00:24:03,309
You ain't mopping
up shit, Mr. Jason.

370
00:24:05,411 --> 00:24:06,646
You ready?

371
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:09,381
You created me man.

372
00:24:10,149 --> 00:24:11,751
You can't kill me!

373
00:24:12,384 --> 00:24:14,654
I'm just what you
wanted me to be!

374
00:24:14,654 --> 00:24:15,922
(guns cock)

375
00:24:15,922 --> 00:24:17,724
But at the wrong time.

376
00:24:18,324 --> 00:24:18,958
Fire!

377
00:24:18,958 --> 00:24:20,026
(guns fire)

378
00:24:20,026 --> 00:24:23,195
(screaming)

379
00:24:37,810 --> 00:24:42,782
(anticipating music)

380
00:24:48,555 --> 00:24:50,389
Prepare him for combustion.

381
00:24:51,257 --> 00:24:52,559
Doug, R.J.'s gone man.

382
00:24:52,559 --> 00:24:53,325
All right, all right.

383
00:24:53,325 --> 00:24:54,260
She hit the door...

384
00:24:54,260 --> 00:24:55,261
Sir, Garrett has gone AWOL.

385
00:24:55,261 --> 00:24:56,563
We'll deal with it.

386
00:24:56,563 --> 00:24:58,064
But sir, Garrett is gone.

387
00:24:58,064 --> 00:25:00,900
I said we'll deal with
it, now get ready to clear.

388
00:25:01,568 --> 00:25:02,334
Now!

389
00:25:02,735 --> 00:25:03,603
What about me?

390
00:25:03,603 --> 00:25:05,471
Hey Matt, relax.

391
00:25:05,872 --> 00:25:07,940
I will contact you
about recruitment.

392
00:25:08,575 --> 00:25:11,243
Not a word to anyone
about what you saw, right?

393
00:25:11,243 --> 00:25:13,846
Right, I don't even
know what the hell I saw.

394
00:25:13,846 --> 00:25:15,047
Keep it that way.

395
00:25:15,047 --> 00:25:15,915
All right.

396
00:25:15,915 --> 00:25:19,986
(upbeat music)

397
00:25:21,954 --> 00:25:23,355
All right so listen.

398
00:25:24,724 --> 00:25:26,358
I'll have a second team
up here in less than,

399
00:25:26,358 --> 00:25:27,960
hey, listen to me!

400
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:30,597
I'll have a second team up
here in less than five minutes,

401
00:25:30,597 --> 00:25:32,131
you know the procedure,

402
00:25:32,131 --> 00:25:33,933
anybody got any questions,

403
00:25:33,933 --> 00:25:36,002
you report them to me.

404
00:25:36,002 --> 00:25:36,769
Yeah.

405
00:25:36,769 --> 00:25:37,737
You got it, me.

406
00:25:37,737 --> 00:25:39,205
Yeah, yeah, I know the drill.

407
00:25:39,205 --> 00:25:40,306
All right.

408
00:25:43,142 --> 00:25:47,747
(foreboding music)

409
00:26:11,237 --> 00:26:12,504
(screaming)

410
00:26:15,241 --> 00:26:16,909
Adios private.

411
00:26:18,645 --> 00:26:19,779
Clean Stevens'
ashes out of there

412
00:26:19,779 --> 00:26:21,313
and get back to your post.

413
00:26:21,881 --> 00:26:23,415
We got a report to make.

414
00:26:23,415 --> 00:26:28,187
(foreboding music)

415
00:26:36,128 --> 00:26:37,463
Loss of control
is the one thing

416
00:26:37,463 --> 00:26:39,198
we should all fear.

417
00:26:40,432 --> 00:26:43,569
Private Stevens' training
was almost complete.

418
00:26:44,203 --> 00:26:48,074
To lose him now is
inexcusable for all of us.

419
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:50,309
I'm sorry Colonel Muthuh.

420
00:26:50,309 --> 00:26:52,211
Stevens got excited,
he initiated a level 10

421
00:26:52,211 --> 00:26:54,113
trancing state.

422
00:26:54,113 --> 00:26:55,682
He couldn't be controlled, sir.

423
00:26:55,682 --> 00:26:57,483
And Garrett went AWOL?

424
00:26:57,483 --> 00:26:59,518
Tsk, tsk, tsk.

425
00:26:59,518 --> 00:27:02,054
Oh, where was Jason
during all of this?

426
00:27:02,054 --> 00:27:05,191
Mr. Jason was dealing
with the mop-up operation,

427
00:27:05,191 --> 00:27:08,060
sir, that's when
Garrett deserted.

428
00:27:08,060 --> 00:27:09,428
Daddy, I'm sorry...

429
00:27:10,129 --> 00:27:11,698
Lieutenant Ryan.

430
00:27:11,698 --> 00:27:14,600
I'm sure your written
report will be complete

431
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:17,403
in every detail, carry on.

432
00:27:18,037 --> 00:27:19,005
[Lt. Ryan] Yes sir.

433
00:27:21,207 --> 00:27:22,508
In the mean time.

434
00:27:23,843 --> 00:27:27,780
Private Shark will give me her

435
00:27:28,715 --> 00:27:31,718
oral impressions
of the incident.

436
00:27:32,551 --> 00:27:33,585
Yes sir.

437
00:27:34,486 --> 00:27:39,491
(foreboding music)

438
00:28:27,673 --> 00:28:32,578
(electricity crackling)

439
00:28:37,283 --> 00:28:40,887
(groans)

440
00:28:42,321 --> 00:28:44,056
Pfft...

441
00:28:45,792 --> 00:28:47,126
L.A. never changes.

442
00:28:47,794 --> 00:28:49,095
Big nowhere.

443
00:28:51,363 --> 00:28:53,800
(groaning)

444
00:28:55,367 --> 00:28:57,236
If there's any justice,

445
00:28:57,236 --> 00:28:59,271
you'll open my old office.

446
00:29:00,606 --> 00:29:02,508
Wherever the hell
that is from here.

447
00:29:03,342 --> 00:29:05,644
(groaning)

448
00:29:06,512 --> 00:29:08,314
Oh, trance...

449
00:29:09,215 --> 00:29:11,550
Trance for me Jana.

450
00:29:12,218 --> 00:29:14,553
Show me, you can make the change

451
00:29:14,553 --> 00:29:18,390
on your own, you
should show me, yes.

452
00:29:18,390 --> 00:29:20,592
Yes, that's it.

453
00:29:20,592 --> 00:29:25,064
That's it now, control it, yes,

454
00:29:25,064 --> 00:29:27,867
remember what Colonel
Muthuh taught you

455
00:29:27,867 --> 00:29:32,104
about discipline, the
discipline you must have.

456
00:29:32,104 --> 00:29:36,843
Now control it, exercise it,
discipline, that's right.

457
00:29:36,843 --> 00:29:40,079
Actively feel it
pulsing, feel it moving

458
00:29:40,079 --> 00:29:43,715
through every limb,
through your brain,

459
00:29:43,715 --> 00:29:46,085
everywhere, that's it.

460
00:29:46,085 --> 00:29:48,620
Now control the flow.

461
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:52,158
Yes, yes, make
that flow your own.

462
00:29:52,158 --> 00:29:55,862
Yes, all right, good.

463
00:29:55,862 --> 00:29:57,363
Good.

464
00:29:57,363 --> 00:29:59,866
Now, look at me.

465
00:30:00,867 --> 00:30:02,668
Look at me, Jana.

466
00:30:03,769 --> 00:30:05,771
Killing you would be so easy.

467
00:30:05,771 --> 00:30:09,075
I know, and I always
want you to feel

468
00:30:09,075 --> 00:30:11,643
that way about your
enemies, I gave you

469
00:30:11,643 --> 00:30:14,780
the power to trance so you
could meet your enemies

470
00:30:14,780 --> 00:30:17,984
without fear, but you
must use that power

471
00:30:17,984 --> 00:30:19,718
with discretion.

472
00:30:19,718 --> 00:30:22,721
Otherwise you'll
be good in combat.

473
00:30:22,721 --> 00:30:25,291
Control is the key.

474
00:30:25,291 --> 00:30:30,229
Without it, you'll die like
that young fool Stevens.

475
00:30:31,297 --> 00:30:36,302
And I'd hate to see that, yes.

476
00:30:38,604 --> 00:30:42,841
Because you're my pride and joy.

477
00:30:44,243 --> 00:30:46,345
Yeah...

478
00:30:47,546 --> 00:30:50,449
Come to daddy.

479
00:30:51,650 --> 00:30:55,254
(moaning)

480
00:31:51,377 --> 00:31:53,412
But my brother
said your program,

481
00:31:53,412 --> 00:31:55,614
made him a better soldier
than he ever hoped.

482
00:31:57,683 --> 00:31:58,985
And I want that too.

483
00:31:59,485 --> 00:32:00,686
That's right.

484
00:32:01,187 --> 00:32:03,555
And all you gotta do
is sign, right here.

485
00:32:04,590 --> 00:32:05,624
Go ahead.

486
00:32:07,559 --> 00:32:08,494
Go ahead.

487
00:32:08,494 --> 00:32:12,531
(funky music)

488
00:32:20,739 --> 00:32:21,707
Good man.

489
00:32:22,241 --> 00:32:23,142
All right.

490
00:32:24,010 --> 00:32:25,011
Let's go.

491
00:32:27,746 --> 00:32:28,747
That's it?

492
00:32:28,747 --> 00:32:30,482
[Jason] That's it, let's go.

493
00:32:46,298 --> 00:32:48,234
This might sound
silly to you, but,

494
00:32:48,234 --> 00:32:49,601
I'm really excited.

495
00:32:50,202 --> 00:32:51,870
Well now you're a
part of one of the most

496
00:32:51,870 --> 00:32:54,373
elite fighting corps
that has ever existed.

497
00:33:04,250 --> 00:33:09,055
(foreboding music)

498
00:33:09,855 --> 00:33:10,822
So anyway.

499
00:33:11,490 --> 00:33:12,658
Sorry.

500
00:33:15,094 --> 00:33:18,597
My brother, that's
Lieutenant R...

501
00:33:20,066 --> 00:33:22,068
Lieutenant Ryan, you
guys met in the bar.

502
00:33:22,068 --> 00:33:23,435
Yeah.

503
00:33:23,435 --> 00:33:25,237
He's been talking about
this guy, Daddy Muthuh?

504
00:33:25,237 --> 00:33:26,938
Colonel, Colonel Muthuh.

505
00:33:26,938 --> 00:33:28,474
Yeah, who's Daddy Muthuh?

506
00:33:28,474 --> 00:33:29,975
Colonel Muthuh.

507
00:33:29,975 --> 00:33:32,444
He's the doctor that
created all this.

508
00:33:32,444 --> 00:33:35,814
He's a genius and now
the most important person

509
00:33:35,814 --> 00:33:37,083
in your life.

510
00:33:37,783 --> 00:33:38,984
Holy shit.

511
00:33:39,518 --> 00:33:40,686
Yeah.

512
00:33:41,220 --> 00:33:43,122
Look to your right,
guns on the wall.

513
00:33:43,122 --> 00:33:44,190
Man I love it.

514
00:33:44,190 --> 00:33:48,927
(ominous music)

515
00:33:48,927 --> 00:33:50,829
Could this be our new cruit?

516
00:33:50,829 --> 00:33:51,730
Who's his guy?

517
00:33:51,730 --> 00:33:53,099
[Jason] Colonel Muthuh.

518
00:33:53,099 --> 00:33:55,167
Uh, yes sir, I think so.

519
00:33:55,167 --> 00:33:57,303
No, no, just
put your arm down.

520
00:33:58,104 --> 00:33:59,938
At ease son, I understand

521
00:33:59,938 --> 00:34:02,808
you'll be following in
your brother's footsteps?

522
00:34:02,808 --> 00:34:04,743
We're very proud
of Lieutenant Ryan.

523
00:34:04,743 --> 00:34:08,114
Well he's proud to be a part
of the Trancer Program, sir.

524
00:34:08,114 --> 00:34:11,117
That's what I like
to hear, carry on.

525
00:34:12,418 --> 00:34:13,585
I'll see ya.

526
00:34:16,622 --> 00:34:17,989
What about Private Garrett?

527
00:34:19,125 --> 00:34:21,427
No word on any
operative yet, sir.

528
00:34:22,027 --> 00:34:24,896
Understand this, there are
no deserters from this Corps.

529
00:34:25,797 --> 00:34:28,167
You were presented to me as
a troubleshooter, mister.

530
00:34:29,135 --> 00:34:30,636
Now start shooting.

531
00:34:30,636 --> 00:34:35,407
(foreboding music)

532
00:34:41,413 --> 00:34:44,416
D-E-T-H, Deth.

533
00:34:44,916 --> 00:34:46,685
Yeah, like in the
end of your life,

534
00:34:46,685 --> 00:34:48,154
Lena is the first name.

535
00:34:49,788 --> 00:34:50,989
Nothing at all?

536
00:34:51,890 --> 00:34:52,924
Thanks.

537
00:34:56,362 --> 00:34:57,396
Damn!

538
00:35:10,075 --> 00:35:10,976
Hey!

539
00:35:11,877 --> 00:35:13,812
Spare a five buddy?

540
00:35:13,812 --> 00:35:15,681
Sorry pal, all I got is...

541
00:35:19,485 --> 00:35:21,453
Hey that's my blanket man!

542
00:35:21,453 --> 00:35:25,657
(foreboding music)

543
00:35:27,793 --> 00:35:29,060
Here.

544
00:35:30,562 --> 00:35:32,831
Buy yourself a couple
of bottles of warmth.

545
00:35:45,744 --> 00:35:48,647
Hi uh, I'm looking for Lena.

546
00:35:49,348 --> 00:35:50,349
Mom?

547
00:35:53,084 --> 00:35:54,253
Can I help you?

548
00:35:54,253 --> 00:35:58,524
(foreboding music)

549
00:36:02,928 --> 00:36:05,331
[Jack] So I guess you got
a cannon for an arm, huh?

550
00:36:05,331 --> 00:36:08,767
I'm not bad, last game
I had five strikeouts,

551
00:36:08,767 --> 00:36:11,069
and they were all
sixth grade boys.

552
00:36:11,069 --> 00:36:13,672
My uncle Hap coaches
me sometimes.

553
00:36:13,672 --> 00:36:15,474
Yeah, he was a good pitcher.

554
00:36:15,474 --> 00:36:18,244
Now he owns the San
Francisco Rockets!

555
00:36:18,244 --> 00:36:21,447
I get free tickets
every Christmas.

556
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:23,048
I'm going outside, Ma.

557
00:36:23,048 --> 00:36:24,082
Okay.

558
00:36:26,418 --> 00:36:27,353
Nice kid.

559
00:36:27,986 --> 00:36:28,987
I think so.

560
00:36:31,156 --> 00:36:32,558
Nice place, Lena.

561
00:36:32,558 --> 00:36:34,125
Yeah, we like it.

562
00:36:35,561 --> 00:36:36,762
I know this is
a hell of a shock,

563
00:36:36,762 --> 00:36:38,029
I would've called first,

564
00:36:38,029 --> 00:36:39,431
but then again, I was
looking for Lena Deth.

565
00:36:40,332 --> 00:36:41,900
Not Ms. Forest.

566
00:36:42,568 --> 00:36:44,336
It's been 13 years, Jack.

567
00:36:44,870 --> 00:36:46,772
More like 13 hours for me.

568
00:36:46,772 --> 00:36:48,540
That night I was
supposed to see you,

569
00:36:49,541 --> 00:36:51,142
I got hijacked up the line.

570
00:36:52,278 --> 00:36:53,979
It doesn't make
any difference now.

571
00:36:55,947 --> 00:36:57,516
You're not gonna let
me explain this, are ya?

572
00:36:57,516 --> 00:36:58,717
I already know what happened,

573
00:36:58,717 --> 00:37:00,586
you left without
a word, nothing.

574
00:37:00,586 --> 00:37:02,521
That's what I'm trying
to tell you about now.

575
00:37:02,521 --> 00:37:04,423
I didn't know if you
were dead or alive.

576
00:37:05,090 --> 00:37:06,858
I waited for some sort
of word from the cops,

577
00:37:06,858 --> 00:37:08,093
there was nothing.

578
00:37:08,994 --> 00:37:11,497
I woke up one morning
and I was a year older.

579
00:37:11,497 --> 00:37:12,864
Yeah, well you don't look it.

580
00:37:12,864 --> 00:37:14,566
Not a year, not a day.

581
00:37:14,566 --> 00:37:17,303
I found someone special, Jack.

582
00:37:18,203 --> 00:37:20,171
Yeah, what's he like?

583
00:37:20,906 --> 00:37:22,341
Is he good to you?

584
00:37:22,341 --> 00:37:24,643
He's very down to earth
if you know what I mean.

585
00:37:26,345 --> 00:37:27,513
You know I could
always go up the line

586
00:37:27,513 --> 00:37:29,348
and come back in
1992 and none of this

587
00:37:29,348 --> 00:37:30,849
would've happened.

588
00:37:30,849 --> 00:37:32,418
You wouldn't do
that, would you?

589
00:37:34,019 --> 00:37:35,454
Don't worry, besides,

590
00:37:35,454 --> 00:37:37,689
I got some Trancers to
singe and I need your help.

591
00:37:39,325 --> 00:37:41,126
You read the piece on Garrett?

592
00:37:41,126 --> 00:37:43,729
When did the military
start Trancing experiments?

593
00:37:43,729 --> 00:37:45,331
She claims it's been
going on for years,

594
00:37:45,331 --> 00:37:47,032
it's a real black bag operation.

595
00:37:47,032 --> 00:37:49,368
She used to be a part of
it, but now she wants out.

596
00:37:49,368 --> 00:37:50,936
Yeah well she probably
shouldn't have mouthed off

597
00:37:50,936 --> 00:37:52,471
to the newspaper.

598
00:37:52,471 --> 00:37:54,105
I think she has guts.

599
00:37:55,607 --> 00:37:56,808
Where is she?

600
00:37:59,144 --> 00:38:01,680
Come on Lena, I know you.

601
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:03,715
You're famous for
bringing in strays.

602
00:38:05,584 --> 00:38:07,519
I promised to her I
would keep her safe.

603
00:38:07,886 --> 00:38:09,187
She ain't protected here,

604
00:38:09,187 --> 00:38:10,889
she could help me screw
this Trancing operation

605
00:38:10,889 --> 00:38:12,223
into the ground, don't wait for

606
00:38:12,223 --> 00:38:14,192
the government suits to
come looking for her,

607
00:38:14,192 --> 00:38:15,627
I could be Garrett's
only chance.

608
00:38:15,627 --> 00:38:16,762
Lena.

609
00:38:17,763 --> 00:38:19,365
Who the hell is this guy?

610
00:38:20,866 --> 00:38:22,200
R.J. it's okay.

611
00:38:24,570 --> 00:38:26,538
The gun, drop it,

612
00:38:26,538 --> 00:38:28,440
and keep your hands
where I can see them.

613
00:38:28,974 --> 00:38:30,509
It's okay, he's a friend.

614
00:38:33,545 --> 00:38:34,913
[Jack] Do you feel safe yet?

615
00:38:34,913 --> 00:38:36,715
Just as soon as we
verify who you are.

616
00:38:36,715 --> 00:38:38,016
Ex-husband.

617
00:38:40,519 --> 00:38:41,920
I need your help, Garrett.

618
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:43,121
Yeah?

619
00:38:43,121 --> 00:38:44,490
Why the gun?

620
00:38:44,490 --> 00:38:45,724
I'm a Trancer Hunter.

621
00:38:45,724 --> 00:38:49,861
(anticipating music)

622
00:38:55,033 --> 00:38:56,435
Corvette's in the garage,

623
00:38:56,435 --> 00:38:58,770
I had a hell of a time
keeping it away from the bank.

624
00:38:58,770 --> 00:39:00,606
Well at least I
got something left.

625
00:39:00,606 --> 00:39:02,874
Oh you always loved
that car more than me.

626
00:39:05,977 --> 00:39:08,013
That was another decade, Jack.

627
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:10,449
You guys better get going.

628
00:39:11,450 --> 00:39:12,951
You can trust him R.J.

629
00:39:13,519 --> 00:39:15,053
You were really
married to him, huh?

630
00:39:15,053 --> 00:39:15,987
Yep.

631
00:39:16,755 --> 00:39:18,089
Hey, thanks for everything.

632
00:39:20,759 --> 00:39:21,960
You know the only reason
why I'm going with you

633
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:23,629
is because Lena says
you're all right.

634
00:39:23,629 --> 00:39:24,430
Fair enough.

635
00:39:24,430 --> 00:39:25,431
Yeah.

636
00:39:29,034 --> 00:39:30,569
You got a nice life, Lena.

637
00:39:31,036 --> 00:39:32,471
Take care, Jack.

638
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:35,941
See ya.

639
00:39:35,941 --> 00:39:40,245
(sad music)

640
00:40:03,935 --> 00:40:08,907
(upbeat music)
(heaving)

641
00:40:08,907 --> 00:40:12,578
I am charged to kick
some real ass today.

642
00:40:12,578 --> 00:40:13,912
[Lt. Ryan] Don't be too sure.

643
00:40:14,446 --> 00:40:16,147
It's you and me
in the pit, Shark.

644
00:40:16,147 --> 00:40:18,617
Oh, I know who
I'm fighting, sir.

645
00:40:18,617 --> 00:40:20,752
Oh, ah...

646
00:40:21,352 --> 00:40:23,722
(groans)

647
00:40:29,895 --> 00:40:33,064
This is as fine
a group of warriors

648
00:40:33,064 --> 00:40:35,033
as I have ever seen.

649
00:40:36,001 --> 00:40:39,270
You do me and the whole
Trancer Program proud,

650
00:40:39,270 --> 00:40:40,506
all of you.

651
00:40:41,339 --> 00:40:42,841
Hold on there doctor.

652
00:40:43,975 --> 00:40:45,877
This young man

653
00:40:45,877 --> 00:40:47,813
is a new recruit.

654
00:40:48,580 --> 00:40:52,017
And I reserve the
right to administer

655
00:40:52,017 --> 00:40:55,854
the first injection myself.

656
00:40:55,854 --> 00:40:57,055
Son.

657
00:40:58,256 --> 00:41:01,527
This is your very
first step on the road

658
00:41:01,527 --> 00:41:04,229
to becoming the elite.

659
00:41:04,229 --> 00:41:08,433
One of the best fighting
men in the world.

660
00:41:08,433 --> 00:41:12,538
(upbeat music)

661
00:41:12,538 --> 00:41:14,272
(groaning)

662
00:41:14,272 --> 00:41:16,274
[Lt. Ryan] It's a
riot, baby brother.

663
00:41:16,274 --> 00:41:19,044
But you're gonna
love it, trust me.

664
00:41:20,278 --> 00:41:22,180
Yes...

665
00:41:23,281 --> 00:41:25,751
Now this will be a
demonstration of combat,

666
00:41:25,751 --> 00:41:28,654
on a high level trancing mode.

667
00:41:29,888 --> 00:41:32,457
It will allow you
all the opportunity

668
00:41:32,457 --> 00:41:36,194
to see what you'll be capable of

669
00:41:36,194 --> 00:41:39,230
when you reach this
level of readiness.

670
00:41:39,230 --> 00:41:43,569
(foreboding music)

671
00:41:48,707 --> 00:41:53,111
(anticipating music)

672
00:41:57,282 --> 00:41:59,751
Come on Doug, come on man!

673
00:42:04,455 --> 00:42:05,891
(scuffling)

674
00:42:05,891 --> 00:42:10,095
(crowd jeering)

675
00:42:28,614 --> 00:42:30,115
Come on, get up!

676
00:42:31,850 --> 00:42:33,451
Don't you see that
I'm trying to enjoy

677
00:42:33,451 --> 00:42:35,286
the fruits of my labor?

678
00:42:35,286 --> 00:42:40,125
(crowd jeering)
(scuffling)

679
00:42:41,159 --> 00:42:42,961
(laughs)

680
00:42:44,395 --> 00:42:47,365
Yeah bro, that's it,
come on Doug, come on!

681
00:42:47,365 --> 00:42:51,369
(cheering)

682
00:42:52,203 --> 00:42:56,675
(scuffling)

683
00:42:57,709 --> 00:42:59,645
Come on, come on!

684
00:43:06,384 --> 00:43:07,418
Yeah!

685
00:43:07,418 --> 00:43:11,857
(scuffling)

686
00:43:17,796 --> 00:43:20,799
The reporter is Mary Azedonna.

687
00:43:20,799 --> 00:43:23,301
She can be taken out
without any problem.

688
00:43:23,301 --> 00:43:28,239
(scuffling)
(chanting)

689
00:43:28,907 --> 00:43:30,676
As usual, you miss the point.

690
00:43:31,109 --> 00:43:34,345
It's not the reporter,
it's Private Garrett.

691
00:43:35,246 --> 00:43:36,147
Find her.

692
00:43:36,147 --> 00:43:38,684
(scuffling)
(chanting)

693
00:43:38,684 --> 00:43:43,088
[Crowd] Gravel pit, gravel
pit, gravel pit, gravel pit...

694
00:43:45,724 --> 00:43:46,958
And bring her back.

695
00:43:47,859 --> 00:43:48,694
(silenced gun fires)

696
00:43:48,694 --> 00:43:49,861
(groaning)

697
00:43:50,696 --> 00:43:52,964
I can always handle the media.

698
00:43:56,301 --> 00:43:57,002
(silenced gun fires)

699
00:43:57,002 --> 00:43:58,236
(groaning)

700
00:43:58,236 --> 00:44:02,908
(foreboding music)

701
00:44:36,141 --> 00:44:37,342
I've been locked
underground so long,

702
00:44:37,342 --> 00:44:39,244
I forgot there was
an outside world.

703
00:44:41,780 --> 00:44:43,048
Thanks for bringing me.

704
00:44:44,783 --> 00:44:45,784
Yeah.

705
00:44:46,752 --> 00:44:48,119
Do you wanna talk about it?

706
00:44:52,991 --> 00:44:54,592
Well I guess if you
were sent here to kill me,

707
00:44:54,592 --> 00:44:56,261
you'd have done
it already, right?

708
00:44:56,261 --> 00:44:57,562
You bet.

709
00:44:57,562 --> 00:44:59,497
But I only kill Trancers.

710
00:45:06,905 --> 00:45:09,574
Three steroid shots a day
for the past four months.

711
00:45:10,175 --> 00:45:12,811
That's a standard dosage
for a level one soldier.

712
00:45:12,811 --> 00:45:14,345
That's a pretty heavy boost.

713
00:45:14,846 --> 00:45:17,916
[R.J.] Yeah, well it's
nothing compared to level 10.

714
00:45:18,784 --> 00:45:21,452
Look, only squids
can be tranced.

715
00:45:21,452 --> 00:45:23,221
You've got the
guts to fight back,

716
00:45:23,221 --> 00:45:25,023
now what happened to you huh?

717
00:45:25,523 --> 00:45:26,958
I wanted it, okay?

718
00:45:35,801 --> 00:45:37,068
You wanted what, have
your brain scrambled

719
00:45:37,068 --> 00:45:38,636
by a fucking lunatic?

720
00:45:41,539 --> 00:45:43,174
I'm a soldier, Jack.

721
00:45:43,174 --> 00:45:44,810
It's all I got.

722
00:45:45,643 --> 00:45:47,512
I just wanted to be the best.

723
00:45:49,547 --> 00:45:51,416
So after army basic
I was approached

724
00:45:51,416 --> 00:45:54,886
by a suit named Jason, about
an elite fighting group.

725
00:45:54,886 --> 00:45:56,587
Elite fighting group?

726
00:45:56,587 --> 00:45:57,956
Trancing.

727
00:45:59,057 --> 00:46:00,425
It elevates your
physical prowess,

728
00:46:00,425 --> 00:46:01,659
raises your pain thresholds,

729
00:46:01,659 --> 00:46:03,394
so in the field no
one can stop you.

730
00:46:03,895 --> 00:46:05,964
[Jack] Aren't you
forgetting the side effects?

731
00:46:05,964 --> 00:46:07,933
Like it turns you
into a raving psycho

732
00:46:07,933 --> 00:46:11,602
and a whacked out
goddamn zombie, huh?

733
00:46:12,170 --> 00:46:14,139
You don't have to
convince me, Jack.

734
00:46:14,139 --> 00:46:16,374
I'm the one who
is AWOL remember?

735
00:46:17,608 --> 00:46:19,845
I know what trancing
does to you.

736
00:46:21,279 --> 00:46:24,715
(scoffs) Hell of a
soldier, ain't I?

737
00:46:25,851 --> 00:46:28,486
I don't trust the
guys in my outfit,

738
00:46:28,486 --> 00:46:29,754
now I'm a deserter.

739
00:46:30,455 --> 00:46:32,390
I need to get to
the colonel, Garrett.

740
00:46:33,558 --> 00:46:34,625
You can't.

741
00:46:39,130 --> 00:46:40,498
But you can get to Jason.

742
00:46:41,032 --> 00:46:41,867
Here.

743
00:46:42,934 --> 00:46:44,169
Nice cover, huh?

744
00:46:44,735 --> 00:46:45,736
Pure CIA.

745
00:46:49,540 --> 00:46:50,675
Good evening.

746
00:46:51,142 --> 00:46:51,910
How's it going?

747
00:46:51,910 --> 00:46:52,978
[Jack] Okay.

748
00:46:52,978 --> 00:46:54,412
You shouldn't be here,

749
00:46:54,412 --> 00:46:56,214
this is a restricted area,
didn't you see the sign?

750
00:46:56,214 --> 00:46:58,383
We're just having a
conversation, officer.

751
00:46:58,383 --> 00:47:00,585
Oh well, then keep it short.

752
00:47:00,585 --> 00:47:03,421
I didn't mean to
startle you, I just uh,

753
00:47:03,421 --> 00:47:06,157
noticed this gorgeous Vette,
and I had to come down

754
00:47:06,157 --> 00:47:07,558
and take a look.

755
00:47:07,558 --> 00:47:10,028
Yeah, she's real fine my 409.

756
00:47:11,629 --> 00:47:13,798
A 60 Vette and the Beach Boys?

757
00:47:13,798 --> 00:47:15,600
I could've guessed.

758
00:47:15,600 --> 00:47:16,267
(gun fires)

759
00:47:16,267 --> 00:47:17,602
(groaning)

760
00:47:17,602 --> 00:47:19,737
(anticipating music)

761
00:47:19,737 --> 00:47:21,973
Come here you dizzy bitch,
you just dumped a cop!

762
00:47:21,973 --> 00:47:24,142
[R.J.] She's not a
cop Jack, she's a phony.

763
00:47:24,142 --> 00:47:25,911
God, you almost
shot her in her eye.

764
00:47:25,911 --> 00:47:27,412
Nail polish, ring.

765
00:47:27,913 --> 00:47:29,280
That's not regulation,
check if her weapon

766
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:30,748
is a Browning.

767
00:47:30,748 --> 00:47:34,119
Shit, she's one of
Jason's CIA dorks,

768
00:47:34,119 --> 00:47:35,386
we've been tagged.

769
00:47:35,386 --> 00:47:36,922
Oh, you're good sweetheart.

770
00:47:36,922 --> 00:47:38,023
You're real good.

771
00:47:38,756 --> 00:47:40,926
That old Muthuh can kiss my ass.

772
00:47:41,960 --> 00:47:46,397
(anticipating music)

773
00:48:07,685 --> 00:48:09,654
Listen Garrett, I
know you're scared,

774
00:48:09,654 --> 00:48:11,489
but we've still got
some moves left.

775
00:48:12,357 --> 00:48:13,858
[R.J.] The colonel
is gonna find us, Jack.

776
00:48:13,858 --> 00:48:16,227
[Jack] No chance, I'm
gonna bury you so deep.

777
00:48:16,227 --> 00:48:18,763
Colonel Muthuh will never
find you in a million years.

778
00:48:18,763 --> 00:48:23,401
(foreboding music)

779
00:48:33,979 --> 00:48:35,446
Jack, where are we?

780
00:48:37,148 --> 00:48:38,583
I wanna send you
to some place safe,

781
00:48:38,583 --> 00:48:39,985
I just haven't
figured out what year.

782
00:48:39,985 --> 00:48:40,818
What are you talking about?

783
00:48:40,818 --> 00:48:41,486
Dammit!

784
00:48:41,486 --> 00:48:42,253
What?

785
00:48:42,253 --> 00:48:43,121
It was right here!

786
00:48:43,588 --> 00:48:44,722
Disappointed?

787
00:48:45,356 --> 00:48:46,391
Back up!

788
00:48:48,193 --> 00:48:49,127
[R.J.] Jack look out!

789
00:48:49,127 --> 00:48:50,661
(scuffling)

790
00:48:50,661 --> 00:48:52,830
One sound, private,
I snap your spine

791
00:48:52,830 --> 00:48:54,032
like a pretzel.

792
00:48:54,032 --> 00:48:55,300
Another wasted
sister, I knew it.

793
00:48:55,300 --> 00:48:57,002
What was he looking for?

794
00:48:57,002 --> 00:48:58,569
A way out of the shitter.

795
00:48:58,569 --> 00:49:00,038
Get up asshole.

796
00:49:10,281 --> 00:49:12,883
Now where on Earth
would you wanna run?

797
00:49:13,551 --> 00:49:17,122
Desert your comrades in
arms at a crucial juncture?

798
00:49:18,256 --> 00:49:21,292
No, I don't think you
understand, private Garrett.

799
00:49:21,292 --> 00:49:23,894
Too much has been
invested in you,

800
00:49:23,894 --> 00:49:26,097
and the only way you're
gonna leave us now,

801
00:49:26,097 --> 00:49:29,067
is inside a body
bag, is that clear?

802
00:49:29,067 --> 00:49:30,368
(ominous music)

803
00:49:30,368 --> 00:49:32,703
Prepare her for
immediate reorientation.

804
00:49:32,703 --> 00:49:35,040
Listen to me Private Garrett.

805
00:49:35,040 --> 00:49:36,474
Now listen.

806
00:49:37,308 --> 00:49:38,543
You're mine.

807
00:49:39,677 --> 00:49:41,112
And I'll need you.

808
00:49:41,779 --> 00:49:45,283
The Corps needs you to fulfill

809
00:49:45,283 --> 00:49:46,917
your destiny.

810
00:49:48,153 --> 00:49:50,088
And you know what that is.

811
00:49:50,955 --> 00:49:52,090
Don't you?

812
00:49:53,558 --> 00:49:54,559
Take her.

813
00:49:54,892 --> 00:49:57,828
(groaning)

814
00:50:05,470 --> 00:50:07,038
Now what are you looking at?

815
00:50:09,874 --> 00:50:12,177
You want a medal for
bringing her back?

816
00:50:13,411 --> 00:50:15,446
If you'd done your job,

817
00:50:15,446 --> 00:50:17,748
this whole thing would
never have happened.

818
00:50:18,383 --> 00:50:20,685
Now I can only
speculate as to why

819
00:50:20,685 --> 00:50:22,487
you were assigned to my project.

820
00:50:23,054 --> 00:50:24,989
But as long as you're here,

821
00:50:24,989 --> 00:50:28,259
I expect more of you than
bureaucratic incompetence.

822
00:50:29,026 --> 00:50:31,629
I'm glad she's back
for the Program's sake.

823
00:50:31,629 --> 00:50:33,098
You're glad, huh?

824
00:50:33,098 --> 00:50:34,999
Well I'm glad you're glad.

825
00:50:34,999 --> 00:50:36,767
In the mean time,
Senator McCoy is coming

826
00:50:36,767 --> 00:50:38,836
and he wants a demonstration.

827
00:50:38,836 --> 00:50:41,439
You set it up for me,
without fail, mister.

828
00:50:42,307 --> 00:50:43,641
We need that funding.

829
00:50:43,641 --> 00:50:46,344
If it goes as well
as it did today, sir,

830
00:50:46,944 --> 00:50:49,013
the senator should be impressed.

831
00:50:50,181 --> 00:50:51,949
You never served, did you?

832
00:50:52,550 --> 00:50:54,018
In armed conflict.

833
00:50:55,320 --> 00:50:56,654
You know my record.

834
00:50:57,788 --> 00:51:00,458
Covert operations.

835
00:51:01,392 --> 00:51:04,795
No, I meant something
in the field.

836
00:51:05,630 --> 00:51:08,666
Up to your ankles in mud
and other soldiers' guts.

837
00:51:08,666 --> 00:51:11,902
Waiting for that moment
to re-engage the enemy.

838
00:51:13,471 --> 00:51:15,039
Real combat.

839
00:51:15,840 --> 00:51:18,143
I've been on
extensive maneuvers sir,

840
00:51:18,143 --> 00:51:20,345
in combat simulations,

841
00:51:20,345 --> 00:51:22,280
and I wouldn't be
afraid to fight.

842
00:51:24,149 --> 00:51:25,516
And you're a fool.

843
00:51:28,319 --> 00:51:32,022
Fear can make you sharp.

844
00:51:33,791 --> 00:51:36,327
As soon as I pass my boards,

845
00:51:36,327 --> 00:51:40,030
I went right into the
Army Medical Corps.

846
00:51:40,698 --> 00:51:44,535
For years I watched our
boys die in the field

847
00:51:44,535 --> 00:51:47,172
because they weren't trained
to fight with everything

848
00:51:47,172 --> 00:51:51,442
they had, that's when I started
work on the trancing drug.

849
00:51:52,410 --> 00:51:54,212
To save them.
(gun cocks)

850
00:51:55,813 --> 00:51:58,783
Well I find your
accomplishment enviable.

851
00:52:00,218 --> 00:52:01,619
You don't like it
when some of my soldiers

852
00:52:01,619 --> 00:52:04,189
refer to me as Daddy
Muthuh, do you?

853
00:52:04,189 --> 00:52:06,557
I just find it
disrespectful, sir.

854
00:52:07,192 --> 00:52:08,593
It's a combat name.

855
00:52:09,860 --> 00:52:12,830
I was mother and father to
those boys in the field.

856
00:52:12,830 --> 00:52:14,732
But I bet you've never
been there, have you?

857
00:52:15,233 --> 00:52:18,035
No, you've never tasted blood.

858
00:52:19,103 --> 00:52:20,438
And if you don't know

859
00:52:21,005 --> 00:52:23,208
how it feels to be a soldier,

860
00:52:25,210 --> 00:52:27,712
then how can you possibly know

861
00:52:28,779 --> 00:52:32,049
what a soldier needs to be

862
00:52:32,049 --> 00:52:35,220
a great warrior?

863
00:52:35,220 --> 00:52:39,224
(foreboding music)

864
00:52:39,224 --> 00:52:42,026
(laughs)

865
00:52:43,928 --> 00:52:46,664
My little bureaucrat.

866
00:52:49,033 --> 00:52:50,768
He's a squirrelly
civilian, isn't he?

867
00:52:50,768 --> 00:52:52,570
(groaning)

868
00:52:54,104 --> 00:52:55,906
He doesn't get
it, hit him again.

869
00:52:57,708 --> 00:52:59,510
[Col. Muthuh] Oh, how
are you feeling now?

870
00:53:01,712 --> 00:53:02,847
Never better.

871
00:53:03,348 --> 00:53:05,082
If you had any
vision, you'd understand

872
00:53:05,082 --> 00:53:06,851
what this is all about.

873
00:53:07,285 --> 00:53:10,421
So I'm gonna give you
a taste, Mr. Deth,

874
00:53:10,421 --> 00:53:14,759
who knows, you may even
be officer material.

875
00:53:14,759 --> 00:53:16,427
Only squids can be tranced.

876
00:53:16,427 --> 00:53:18,596
Like Private Garrett?

877
00:53:20,265 --> 00:53:23,534
Just watch my eyes, Jack Deth.

878
00:53:23,534 --> 00:53:28,172
Listen to my voice,
lose yourself in it,

879
00:53:28,172 --> 00:53:30,708
no, no, no, you can't go back

880
00:53:30,708 --> 00:53:33,511
so why fight it, much easier,

881
00:53:33,511 --> 00:53:37,114
just to give yourself up to me.

882
00:53:37,114 --> 00:53:39,950
(screams)

883
00:53:40,918 --> 00:53:43,921
Just let it pass.

884
00:53:49,327 --> 00:53:50,595
If you wouldn't fight the drugs

885
00:53:50,595 --> 00:53:53,298
they wouldn't rip you as
much when you come down.

886
00:53:56,767 --> 00:53:58,903
I hate losing control
to these bastards.

887
00:54:01,639 --> 00:54:03,408
It's my brain, it's not theirs.

888
00:54:03,408 --> 00:54:05,876
You better cool it, now.

889
00:54:06,411 --> 00:54:08,078
Colonel Muthuh let you
back into this Program

890
00:54:08,078 --> 00:54:09,914
instead of having you shot.

891
00:54:10,648 --> 00:54:15,152
So you better start acting
accordingly, private.

892
00:54:15,152 --> 00:54:16,687
Understand?

893
00:54:19,890 --> 00:54:21,392
What did they do to Jack Deth?

894
00:54:22,126 --> 00:54:23,994
Let the colonel
worry about him.

895
00:54:23,994 --> 00:54:25,963
Let me worry about you.

896
00:54:27,164 --> 00:54:31,669
(foreboding music)

897
00:54:33,438 --> 00:54:37,608
(groaning)

898
00:54:40,210 --> 00:54:41,512
I'm really looking
forward to meeting our

899
00:54:41,512 --> 00:54:42,780
honored guest, sir.

900
00:54:42,780 --> 00:54:44,782
Senator McCoy is
one of the few men

901
00:54:44,782 --> 00:54:48,085
on Capitol Hill
or anywhere else,

902
00:54:48,085 --> 00:54:50,588
who understands
what we're about.

903
00:54:51,356 --> 00:54:52,557
We'll take him where
you want him to go, sir.

904
00:54:52,557 --> 00:54:54,024
You're a good man, lieutenant.

905
00:54:54,659 --> 00:54:55,860
Good man.

906
00:54:57,362 --> 00:55:02,066
(anticipating music)

907
00:55:17,515 --> 00:55:19,617
I'm gonna be honest
with you, colonel.

908
00:55:19,617 --> 00:55:21,952
Unless I really see something,

909
00:55:21,952 --> 00:55:24,389
the money spigot's
gonna be turned off.

910
00:55:24,389 --> 00:55:26,023
You know that Defense
programs are just

911
00:55:26,023 --> 00:55:28,526
as important in peace
time as they are

912
00:55:28,526 --> 00:55:30,495
in war time, senator.

913
00:55:30,495 --> 00:55:32,129
Now the work that
we're doing here,

914
00:55:32,129 --> 00:55:34,264
could make the difference,

915
00:55:34,264 --> 00:55:36,000
in our next conflict.

916
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:38,302
Well then why don't
you try to impress me?

917
00:55:44,174 --> 00:55:47,545
You see senator, when a
soldier is in a trancing state,

918
00:55:47,545 --> 00:55:50,681
he or she, is capable of
incredible physical acts

919
00:55:50,681 --> 00:55:53,217
in the field, but we don't
want them wasting their energy,

920
00:55:53,217 --> 00:55:55,986
which is why each soldier
can find that discipline

921
00:55:55,986 --> 00:55:59,156
to trance, only when it's
absolutely necessary.

922
00:55:59,156 --> 00:56:02,527
But the trancing mode is
still started by this steroid?

923
00:56:02,527 --> 00:56:03,160
Isn't it?

924
00:56:03,160 --> 00:56:04,695
Yes it is.

925
00:56:04,695 --> 00:56:08,098
By the time a soldier reaches
level 10 of his training,

926
00:56:08,098 --> 00:56:11,569
he can bring that trancing
mode out of himself,

927
00:56:11,569 --> 00:56:13,471
without the use of drugs.

928
00:56:13,471 --> 00:56:16,674
Oh yes, a troop's strength
can be enhanced chemically

929
00:56:16,674 --> 00:56:19,777
if we choose to do so, we
always have that option.

930
00:56:20,545 --> 00:56:23,814
(groaning)

931
00:56:23,814 --> 00:56:26,350
(heaving)

932
00:56:26,350 --> 00:56:30,921
(laughs) You're right,
that's one hell of a kick.

933
00:56:30,921 --> 00:56:32,790
You're still at
charity, little bro.

934
00:56:32,790 --> 00:56:34,459
Wait until you reach level 10.

935
00:56:34,459 --> 00:56:35,560
Come on.

936
00:56:37,227 --> 00:56:40,097
Hey, daddy's little helpers.

937
00:56:42,366 --> 00:56:44,502
You fucked with the
wrong brothers, Ace.

938
00:56:45,169 --> 00:56:47,104
(laughing)

939
00:56:47,104 --> 00:56:48,338
(spits)

940
00:56:50,675 --> 00:56:52,477
Colonel the problem
isn't that your program

941
00:56:52,477 --> 00:56:54,211
has failed, the
problem is that there's

942
00:56:54,211 --> 00:56:56,280
no place for it anymore.

943
00:56:56,280 --> 00:56:58,716
The world has changed,
our defense monies

944
00:56:58,716 --> 00:57:00,885
are going into
different pockets now.

945
00:57:03,488 --> 00:57:06,290
I'm not talking about
the world, senator.

946
00:57:06,991 --> 00:57:08,526
I'm talking about this country.

947
00:57:08,526 --> 00:57:10,961
I'm talking about
using my soldiers

948
00:57:10,961 --> 00:57:13,531
to wage a war against the scum

949
00:57:13,531 --> 00:57:15,800
that's turning this
land into a cesspool.

950
00:57:15,800 --> 00:57:17,502
Making honest citizens afraid

951
00:57:17,502 --> 00:57:19,103
in their own homes.

952
00:57:19,103 --> 00:57:22,039
I'm talking about
reclaiming our cities.

953
00:57:22,039 --> 00:57:25,142
Our neighborhoods, our streets.

954
00:57:25,910 --> 00:57:28,412
Now that's something
worth fighting for,

955
00:57:28,412 --> 00:57:29,547
isn't it?

956
00:57:32,149 --> 00:57:36,621
Senator, you have no idea,

957
00:57:36,621 --> 00:57:39,690
what my soldiers are capable of.

958
00:57:44,228 --> 00:57:46,063
You're not getting me, no.

959
00:57:46,731 --> 00:57:48,866
You're not gonna get me, nah-ah.

960
00:57:49,433 --> 00:57:52,537
(foreboding music)

961
00:57:52,537 --> 00:57:54,271
The colonel wants
to see you in the pit.

962
00:57:55,540 --> 00:57:56,440
Now.

963
00:57:57,041 --> 00:57:58,208
Very well.

964
00:58:03,013 --> 00:58:04,314
Oh God, Jack.

965
00:58:04,982 --> 00:58:07,552
Jack, it's R.J.

966
00:58:07,552 --> 00:58:10,320
(upbeat music)
(scuffling)

967
00:58:10,320 --> 00:58:13,758
[Lt. Ryan] Jesus Matt,
what are you doing?

968
00:58:13,758 --> 00:58:16,093
Come on, fight me Matt!

969
00:58:16,093 --> 00:58:17,962
I give up, Doug.

970
00:58:18,796 --> 00:58:19,429
I give up.

971
00:58:19,429 --> 00:58:21,599
(scuffling)

972
00:58:21,599 --> 00:58:26,203
(groaning)

973
00:58:34,311 --> 00:58:35,780
I told you.

974
00:58:36,614 --> 00:58:40,084
They are the finest
warriors in the world.

975
00:58:42,186 --> 00:58:44,121
Oh come on, let's
get outta here, Jack.

976
00:58:44,722 --> 00:58:46,190
What do you mean,
let's get outta here,

977
00:58:46,190 --> 00:58:47,592
where the hell are we going?

978
00:58:47,592 --> 00:58:48,793
I don't know, we're
just getting out of here.

979
00:58:48,793 --> 00:58:49,727
If you hadn't
mouthed off, I would

980
00:58:49,727 --> 00:58:50,828
never have been in this mess.

981
00:58:50,828 --> 00:58:51,929
Just a second.

982
00:58:56,801 --> 00:58:58,035
Jack.

983
00:59:03,941 --> 00:59:05,810
No offense R.J., but
if this is a setup,

984
00:59:05,810 --> 00:59:07,978
I'm gonna turn you
into fish food.

985
00:59:07,978 --> 00:59:09,947
Jack I can't
control my trancing,

986
00:59:09,947 --> 00:59:11,649
I don't know what I might do.

987
00:59:11,649 --> 00:59:13,618
I just wanna get
the hell outta here.

988
00:59:13,618 --> 00:59:14,819
You can fight it.

989
00:59:14,819 --> 00:59:16,153
With my help.

990
00:59:16,153 --> 00:59:18,288
But you gotta want
it, goddammit.

991
00:59:23,427 --> 00:59:25,963
And that's why I wanna show
you the main trancing chamber,

992
00:59:25,963 --> 00:59:28,833
once a soldier is in place,
his mind can be turned over

993
00:59:28,833 --> 00:59:30,635
to me in a matter of minutes,

994
00:59:30,635 --> 00:59:33,738
in fact I'll show you
our latest conquest.

995
00:59:34,204 --> 00:59:36,373
It's amazingly effective.

996
00:59:39,143 --> 00:59:41,078
(gun fires)

997
00:59:41,078 --> 00:59:42,546
Arm yourselves!

998
00:59:43,013 --> 00:59:44,782
That's an order.

999
00:59:47,785 --> 00:59:49,053
How you holding up, R.J.?

1000
00:59:49,053 --> 00:59:50,755
I'm holding on Jack,
but the colonel's shit

1001
00:59:50,755 --> 00:59:52,222
is pulling me the other way.

1002
00:59:52,222 --> 00:59:54,659
Hey, just remember
who the bad guys are.

1003
00:59:57,094 --> 00:59:57,995
Let's get outta here.

1004
00:59:57,995 --> 01:00:01,732
(anticipating music)

1005
01:00:10,607 --> 01:00:12,276
You guaranteed me results,

1006
01:00:12,276 --> 01:00:14,478
you can't even guarantee
me my own safety

1007
01:00:14,478 --> 01:00:15,646
in this fucking place.

1008
01:00:15,646 --> 01:00:17,014
I will provide
personal escort...

1009
01:00:17,014 --> 01:00:19,049
You're wrong again, colonel.

1010
01:00:19,717 --> 01:00:22,687
I'll mail you a copy
of my recommendations

1011
01:00:22,687 --> 01:00:25,222
for funding, asshole.

1012
01:00:27,725 --> 01:00:29,994
Attention everybody,
this is the colonel,

1013
01:00:29,994 --> 01:00:32,763
this is a code red,
repeat, code red!

1014
01:00:32,763 --> 01:00:34,799
Private Garrett is trying
to escape with the prisoner.

1015
01:00:34,799 --> 01:00:39,436
(alarm blaring)
(guns cocking)

1016
01:00:44,374 --> 01:00:47,845
Bring the power out of yourself.

1017
01:00:47,845 --> 01:00:50,380
Use the power I gave you

1018
01:00:50,380 --> 01:00:53,751
and annihilate with
extreme prejudice.

1019
01:00:53,751 --> 01:00:58,588
(guns firing)

1020
01:01:23,613 --> 01:01:24,915
(groaning)

1021
01:01:24,915 --> 01:01:26,383
(gun fires)

1022
01:01:28,618 --> 01:01:30,888
Hey R.J., you could help
me kill one of these guys,

1023
01:01:30,888 --> 01:01:32,289
you know?

1024
01:01:32,289 --> 01:01:34,591
I'm trying Jack, but
colonel Muthuh is still inside

1025
01:01:34,591 --> 01:01:36,593
my head, I can't help it.

1026
01:01:37,762 --> 01:01:39,897
If I pull it off,
you can pull it off.

1027
01:01:39,897 --> 01:01:42,099
Fight it goddammit, I
don't wanna kill you.

1028
01:01:42,099 --> 01:01:43,333
Jack!

1029
01:01:43,333 --> 01:01:45,169
Fight it, goddammit!

1030
01:01:45,169 --> 01:01:46,470
Drop to the floor!

1031
01:01:47,471 --> 01:01:52,309
(guns fire)
(anticipating music)

1032
01:01:59,416 --> 01:02:00,584
[Jack] I knew you could do it.

1033
01:02:01,952 --> 01:02:03,087
Nice shooting R.J.

1034
01:02:03,821 --> 01:02:06,390
I tried Jack, I tried.

1035
01:02:07,024 --> 01:02:10,627
(anticipating music)

1036
01:02:10,627 --> 01:02:11,829
Kill me.

1037
01:02:14,231 --> 01:02:15,232
Kill me!

1038
01:02:17,567 --> 01:02:19,069
(gun fires)

1039
01:02:19,603 --> 01:02:23,974
(groaning)

1040
01:02:25,075 --> 01:02:29,814
(sad music)

1041
01:02:50,567 --> 01:02:54,538
(electricity crackling)

1042
01:02:54,538 --> 01:02:55,906
(glass shattering)

1043
01:02:57,707 --> 01:02:59,877
Where is Jack Deth?

1044
01:03:01,111 --> 01:03:05,850
(anticipating music)

1045
01:03:10,220 --> 01:03:11,488
(groaning)

1046
01:03:13,858 --> 01:03:15,993
Thanks for doing my
job for me civilian.

1047
01:03:15,993 --> 01:03:17,427
(scuffling)

1048
01:03:18,628 --> 01:03:19,696
You know, it makes me sick,

1049
01:03:19,696 --> 01:03:20,931
I have to spend my life

1050
01:03:20,931 --> 01:03:23,600
defending a country full
of weaklings like you.

1051
01:03:26,937 --> 01:03:30,207
Scum like you, aren't
worth defending at all.

1052
01:03:32,476 --> 01:03:35,612
Weak Jack, weak. (Laughs)

1053
01:03:35,612 --> 01:03:36,881
Huh?

1054
01:03:36,881 --> 01:03:39,083
(neck snaps)

1055
01:03:42,686 --> 01:03:44,054
Hey Godzilla.

1056
01:03:45,122 --> 01:03:47,191
You saved my ass.

1057
01:03:48,758 --> 01:03:49,793
That's what Colonel Stillwell

1058
01:03:49,793 --> 01:03:51,328
sent me here to do.

1059
01:03:52,930 --> 01:03:54,932
I'll help you
fight your enemies.

1060
01:03:58,936 --> 01:04:00,337
[Jack] Come on,
I'll introduce you.

1061
01:04:00,337 --> 01:04:05,075
(upbeat music)

1062
01:04:07,544 --> 01:04:08,545
(gun fires)

1063
01:04:12,149 --> 01:04:16,921
(guns firing)

1064
01:04:28,698 --> 01:04:30,968
Very courageous strike.

1065
01:04:30,968 --> 01:04:33,070
Mr. Deth.

1066
01:04:33,938 --> 01:04:36,974
But one battle is
hardly the war, is it?

1067
01:04:36,974 --> 01:04:39,776
Shove the purple heart,
Muthuh, I'm taking you out.

1068
01:04:39,776 --> 01:04:40,477
Shark!

1069
01:04:40,477 --> 01:04:43,180
(fizzling)

1070
01:04:43,180 --> 01:04:48,185
(foreboding music)

1071
01:04:59,964 --> 01:05:04,969
(scuffling)

1072
01:05:08,405 --> 01:05:10,674
Damn Shark, why don't you
help me get this dizzy bitch

1073
01:05:10,674 --> 01:05:11,641
off of me?

1074
01:05:14,711 --> 01:05:19,416
(groaning)

1075
01:05:26,456 --> 01:05:30,995
(foreboding music)

1076
01:05:32,596 --> 01:05:34,999
Oh you can't
kill me Jack Deth.

1077
01:05:35,532 --> 01:05:36,833
I think I can.

1078
01:05:37,534 --> 01:05:39,869
Even your humor belongs to me.

1079
01:05:40,537 --> 01:05:43,107
I own every thought,
every impulse

1080
01:05:43,107 --> 01:05:45,809
you posses, I know
everything you're gonna say,

1081
01:05:45,809 --> 01:05:47,644
think or do.

1082
01:05:48,445 --> 01:05:50,380
Now look at your hands,
they're starting to shake,

1083
01:05:50,380 --> 01:05:52,016
aren't they, yeah?

1084
01:05:53,017 --> 01:05:56,020
Now put that gun in
your mouth, soldier.

1085
01:06:00,757 --> 01:06:04,328
Like all great warriors who find

1086
01:06:04,328 --> 01:06:06,030
new ways to win.

1087
01:06:07,464 --> 01:06:11,901
I'll find my way,
my place in history.

1088
01:06:13,170 --> 01:06:16,306
Oh, you're starting
to hesitate, Mr. Deth.

1089
01:06:16,306 --> 01:06:18,542
That could get you fragged

1090
01:06:18,542 --> 01:06:20,544
in the field of battle.

1091
01:06:22,112 --> 01:06:23,280
Oh well.

1092
01:06:26,383 --> 01:06:26,916
(gun fires)

1093
01:06:26,916 --> 01:06:27,651
(groans)

1094
01:06:28,885 --> 01:06:30,587
(gun fires)

1095
01:06:30,587 --> 01:06:33,457
(groans)
(glass shatters)

1096
01:06:49,506 --> 01:06:53,677
(beeping)

1097
01:06:53,677 --> 01:06:58,182
(serene music)

1098
01:07:13,830 --> 01:07:15,099
Where the hell have you been?

1099
01:07:15,099 --> 01:07:17,401
Circuit board
damage, it caused

1100
01:07:17,401 --> 01:07:20,104
my power supply to cut
off without warning.

1101
01:07:21,105 --> 01:07:22,506
Oh you're good.

1102
01:07:23,973 --> 01:07:25,209
You're real good.

1103
01:07:25,209 --> 01:07:29,913
(foreboding music)

1104
01:07:32,349 --> 01:07:33,583
Don't do this.

1105
01:07:45,295 --> 01:07:49,899
(serene music)

1106
01:07:49,899 --> 01:07:51,701
You know Shark, I'm uh...

1107
01:07:53,670 --> 01:07:55,139
I'm tired.

1108
01:07:56,573 --> 01:07:58,142
I'm really tired.

1109
01:07:58,675 --> 01:08:00,177
Alice Stillwell
has instructed me

1110
01:08:00,177 --> 01:08:03,147
to give you a message if
you survived this mission.

1111
01:08:05,215 --> 01:08:07,584
Jack my darling, I hope
you're hearing this

1112
01:08:07,584 --> 01:08:09,753
because that means
we've all survived.

1113
01:08:09,753 --> 01:08:11,588
You've given new life
to thousands of people

1114
01:08:11,588 --> 01:08:14,391
up the line, the council
is forever grateful

1115
01:08:14,391 --> 01:08:17,627
and hereby requests your
presence immediately.

1116
01:08:26,270 --> 01:08:27,937
Now I'm really pissed.

1117
01:08:27,937 --> 01:08:32,642
(serene music)

1118
01:08:49,259 --> 01:08:50,894
Welcome back Jack.

1119
01:08:51,495 --> 01:08:52,662
Shark.

1120
01:08:53,096 --> 01:08:55,332
You may approach
us, Commander Deth.

1121
01:08:55,865 --> 01:08:57,401
Cut the crap, Ruthie.

1122
01:08:57,401 --> 01:08:59,603
You guys don't look
any worse for the wear.

1123
01:09:00,270 --> 01:09:01,538
How's your arm, Harris?

1124
01:09:01,538 --> 01:09:03,340
Just fine, Jack.

1125
01:09:03,340 --> 01:09:05,409
Managed to have any
fun down the line?

1126
01:09:05,409 --> 01:09:06,810
Nothing but.

1127
01:09:07,977 --> 01:09:09,213
Alice.

1128
01:09:09,213 --> 01:09:11,080
It's good to see you, Jack.

1129
01:09:11,080 --> 01:09:14,351
The council has summoned you
for a very special reason.

1130
01:09:14,851 --> 01:09:16,085
Not interested.

1131
01:09:16,085 --> 01:09:17,120
I wouldn't mind going
to some of those islands

1132
01:09:17,120 --> 01:09:18,755
offshore with you though.

1133
01:09:19,456 --> 01:09:21,491
Not till we get
this straightened out.

1134
01:09:21,491 --> 01:09:24,027
You did a good job for
us down the line, Jack.

1135
01:09:24,027 --> 01:09:26,396
We want you to keep on doing it.

1136
01:09:26,396 --> 01:09:28,865
We're appointing you our
official Peacekeeping Emissary

1137
01:09:28,865 --> 01:09:31,235
of Time and Space.

1138
01:09:31,235 --> 01:09:33,069
Wait a minute that sounds
like you can bounce me

1139
01:09:33,069 --> 01:09:34,471
from year to year.

1140
01:09:34,471 --> 01:09:36,105
This is an official
appointment Jack,

1141
01:09:36,105 --> 01:09:39,343
it can't be declined,
congratulations.

1142
01:09:39,343 --> 01:09:42,679
For what, who the hell knows
where you can send me next?

1143
01:09:42,679 --> 01:09:44,514
(funky music)

1144
01:09:44,514 --> 01:09:46,082
We do.

1145
01:09:46,082 --> 01:09:49,018
But don't worry,
you won't be alone.

1146
01:09:50,287 --> 01:09:52,021
I could get used
to this again.

1147
01:09:52,021 --> 01:09:53,923
Oh not me, him.

1148
01:09:54,958 --> 01:09:56,526
(laughs)

1149
01:09:56,526 --> 01:09:58,695
Here Jack, you're
gonna need this.

1150
01:09:59,629 --> 01:10:01,331
[Jack] Harris thanks a lot.

1151
01:10:02,366 --> 01:10:03,633
So how about it Jack?

1152
01:10:03,633 --> 01:10:04,768
You wanna start your vacation

1153
01:10:04,768 --> 01:10:06,470
by taking me to dinner?

1154
01:10:06,470 --> 01:10:08,638
That's the best idea
I've heard all century.

1155
01:10:09,573 --> 01:10:12,175
Come on Shark, if we're
gonna be partners.

1156
01:10:12,175 --> 01:10:14,944
You'll like me once you'll
get to know me, Jack Deth.

1157
01:10:15,712 --> 01:10:17,146
You know Shark this
could be the beginning

1158
01:10:17,146 --> 01:10:18,782
of a beautiful...

1159
01:10:21,217 --> 01:10:22,252
Forget it.

1160
01:10:23,353 --> 01:10:27,724
(serene music)
