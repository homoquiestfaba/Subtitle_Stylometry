<i>Two great nations,
linked throughout history.</i>

3
00:00:07,023 --> 00:00:10,385
<i>We discovered America,

4
00:00:10,625 --> 00:00:13,773
<i>We deliberately let you win
the War of Independence,</i>

5
00:00:13,893 --> 00:00:16,418
<i>because you threatened to cry
if we didn't.</i>

6
00:00:16,662 --> 00:00:18,862
<i>And you very kindly joined us</i>

7
00:00:18,982 --> 00:00:21,770
<i>for the last few minutes
of the Second World War, </i>

8
00:00:21,986 --> 00:00:23,359
<i>for which we thank you.</i>

9
00:00:23,479 --> 00:00:26,613
<i>But what about the people
of these two great nations?</i>

10
00:00:26,819 --> 00:00:29,430
<i>How are we alike?
How are we different?</i>

11
00:00:29,582 --> 00:00:32,117
<i>How are we alike?

17
00:00:57,799 --> 00:01:00,202
I got you! I got you! I got you!

18
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:02,803
I got you! I got you! I got you!

19
00:01:12,286 --> 00:01:15,253
Oh, Mr Cab Driver,
could you help me with the...?

20
00:01:23,923 --> 00:01:25,515
I need to use the toilet.

21
00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:28,075
Can you hold on?
We'll be in the room in a minute.

22
00:01:28,195 --> 00:01:30,552
- I wanna go now!
- In a minute!

23
00:01:31,115 --> 00:01:32,411
Hello there,

24
00:01:32,646 --> 00:01:35,096
do you have areservation
under the name Todd?

25
00:01:35,237 --> 00:01:36,736
- Lou Todd?
- Todd?

26
00:01:36,877 --> 00:01:38,943
Yes, that's my name, Lou Todd.

27
00:01:39,121 --> 00:01:42,558
Or it could be under my
friend's name, Andy Pipkin.

28
00:01:43,318 --> 00:01:46,081
- I have a Todd here.
- Excellent.

29
00:01:46,201 --> 00:01:48,489
And now is it a first floor room?

30
00:01:48,609 --> 00:01:52,381
- I don't have first floor.
- I did ask for a first floor room.

31
00:01:52,501 --> 00:01:55,679
Well, I'm sorry,
I got second floor,

32
00:01:55,799 --> 00:01:59,844
a man's coming to fix the elevator
on Monday, I believe, so...

33
00:01:59,964 --> 00:02:03,579
I guess I'll be having to
carry him up those stairs myself.

34
00:02:04,265 --> 00:02:06,011
Thank you for your help, sir.

35
00:02:06,847 --> 00:02:07,854
Right!

36
00:02:08,549 --> 00:02:09,375
Here we go!

37
00:02:10,915 --> 00:02:11,995
Oh, look, Andy,

38
00:02:12,324 --> 00:02:14,906
they've got a pool here,
you can have a swim in there later.

39
00:02:15,047 --> 00:02:16,906
Nah! I bet people piss in it.

This is my daughter,

00:02:46,093 --> 00:02:49,130
she's a big, brave girl
and she's gonna have an operation today.

46
00:02:52,389 --> 00:02:53,218
Name?

47
00:02:53,929 --> 00:02:55,970
- Tell the nice lady your name.
- Danielle.

48
00:02:56,255 --> 00:02:57,430
Danielle what?

49
00:03:00,079 --> 00:03:01,375
Danielle Lloyd.

50
00:03:02,971 --> 00:03:03,972
Age?

51
00:03:04,298 --> 00:03:05,563
Nearly six.

52
00:03:05,923 --> 00:03:07,143
You're five!

53
00:03:11,335 --> 00:03:12,997
Well, say five then.

54
00:03:15,115 --> 00:03:16,116
Address?

55
00:03:17,485 --> 00:03:18,827

We got there!

59
00:03:29,285 --> 00:03:31,257
Just putting your details in now.

60
00:03:31,708 --> 00:03:33,895
Danielle's going to have
her tonsils removed.

61
00:03:34,059 --> 00:03:36,678
I've got her down
for a double hip replacement.

62
00:03:38,567 --> 00:03:40,807
Oh, no, there must be
some kind of mistake.

63
00:03:41,713 --> 00:03:43,074
Computer says no!

64
00:03:44,659 --> 00:03:47,105
Well, that must be some
other Danielle Lloyd.

65
00:03:48,512 --> 00:03:49,911
Computer says no!

66
00:03:50,363 --> 00:03:52,748
There's only one Danielle Lloyd
on the system.

67
00:03:53,076 --> 00:03:55,196
Do you want the
double hip replacement, or not?

68
00:03:57,134 --> 00:03:58,908
No! Clearly she doesn't need it!

69
00:03:59,134 --> 00:04:01,143
Well, she may do in the future.

70
00:04:02,911 --> 00:04:06,601
Look, we saw Dr Phillips last week
and she definitely has an appointment

71
00:04:06,742 --> 00:04:08,710
for today to have her tonsils removed.

72
00:04:10,474 --> 00:04:12,079

73
00:04:13,657 --> 00:04:15,300
Well, could you speak with somebody?

74
00:04:16,185 --> 00:04:17,537
I could, but...

75
00:04:21,867 --> 00:04:23,474
Well, thank you so much.

76
00:04:23,634 --> 00:04:25,143
You've been just great.

77
00:04:25,513 --> 00:04:27,344
Could I borrow
a moment of your time

78
00:04:27,466 --> 00:04:29,663
to fill out the customer
service questionnaire?

79
00:04:30,892 --> 00:04:33,787
Would you say that I've been:
a) very helpful,

80
00:04:34,043 --> 00:04:35,818
b) extremely helpful

81
00:04:35,996 --> 00:04:37,530
or c) fucking helpful?

Miss Ellie-Grace!!
Where did you hear that?

94
00:05:17,375 --> 00:05:19,822
Julie's older brother said
he saw some on the internet.

95
00:05:20,286 --> 00:05:21,366
Oh, did he that?

96
00:05:21,609 --> 00:05:24,911
Yes, Mommy, on a site
called chickswithdicks.com.

97
00:05:26,267 --> 00:05:28,164
I'm gonna have a word
with Julie's mom.

98
00:05:28,324 --> 00:05:30,842
OK, everyone on board now, please.

99
00:05:32,230 --> 00:05:35,296
You'd better get on the bus
before it leaves, Ellie-Grace.

100
00:05:43,334 --> 00:05:44,973
I love you more than kittens!

101
00:05:45,691 --> 00:05:47,517

109
00:06:18,955 --> 00:06:20,577

00:06:27,875 --> 00:06:30,973
she's paying a visit

113
00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:33,600

00:06:43,871 --> 00:06:45,974
- Nice to see you.
- Take a seat.

116
00:06:46,094 --> 00:06:48,059
- Thank you.
- Take a seat.

Lovely! So, Rosie O'Donnell!

00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:56,884
- Rosie? Rosie, Rosie.
- Rosie.

121
00:06:57,004 --> 00:06:59,395
So, Rosie, I've been reading
all about you

122
00:06:59,515 --> 00:07:01,087
in the Fat Fighters Newsletter.

123
00:07:01,207 --> 00:07:04,315
I know you had
your own talk show.

124
00:07:04,435 --> 00:07:06,804
Until Ellen DeGeneres
filled your slot.

125
00:07:06,964 --> 00:07:07,964
And then...

126
00:07:10,158 --> 00:07:11,764
And then it says here...

127
00:07:12,276 --> 00:07:15,797
It says here also that you've been
in some movies.

128
00:07:16,598 --> 00:07:19,116
<i>League Of Their Own</i>,
<i>The Flintstones</i>...

129
00:07:19,236 --> 00:07:21,529
What's this one?
<i>Sleepless In Seattle</i>? I've seen it,

130
00:07:21,649 --> 00:07:24,697
I don't remember you in it,
but we'll take your word for it. And...

131
00:07:24,857 --> 00:07:28,116
It says here that you are a lesbian,

132
00:07:28,566 --> 00:07:31,411
and there's absolutely
nothing wrong with that.

133
00:07:32,236 --> 00:07:33,637
Thank you very much, Marjorie.

134
00:07:33,757 --> 00:07:37,678
Now, Rosie. You... And I know
you won't mind me saying it...

135
00:07:38,072 --> 00:07:39,921
you have had issues with your weight.

136
00:07:40,345 --> 00:07:42,241
- I have.
- You have. She has!

137
00:07:42,721 --> 00:07:43,721
She's big.

138
00:07:43,954 --> 00:07:45,184
She's a big lady.

139
00:07:45,738 --> 00:07:47,653
She's a big, lesbian lady.

140
00:07:49,090 --> 00:07:50,973
Well, Marjorie, here in America,

141
00:07:51,133 --> 00:07:53,518
a lot of us have weight issues,
it affects...

142
00:07:53,678 --> 00:07:57,354
Are you fat because you're a lesbian,
or are you a lesbian because you're fat?

143
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,708
What does that mean?
What do you mean by that?

144
00:08:00,828 --> 00:08:03,947
I mean, did you find it hard
to get a man because of the weight,

145
00:08:04,067 --> 00:08:06,114
and then you think,
"Maybe I'll go lessie,"

146
00:08:06,274 --> 00:08:08,372
- or...
- Marjorie, Marjorie, no, no!

147
00:08:08,492 --> 00:08:10,867
Personally,
I think that you're born gay,

148
00:08:11,057 --> 00:08:14,622
but I'm proud of who I am, I'm a lesbian
woman, I'm in a relationship,

149
00:08:14,782 --> 00:08:17,542
my partner and I have four
beautiful children, so...

150
00:08:17,912 --> 00:08:20,298
Thank you, thank you very much.

151
00:08:22,525 --> 00:08:24,507
She must have bought those
in Africa.

152
00:08:26,168 --> 00:08:30,064
But, you know, Marjorie,
I'm actually here to talk about weight,

153
00:08:30,229 --> 00:08:32,515
so could we just maybe
talk about that?

154
00:08:32,675 --> 00:08:34,135
- Please?
- Yes! Yes!

155
00:08:34,255 --> 00:08:36,269
Yes! Could we just stick
to weight, please?

156
00:08:38,180 --> 00:08:39,180
Thank you.

157
00:08:39,619 --> 00:08:43,359
OK, so let's open it up to the group.
Who's got a question for Rosie?

158
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:47,655
But can we just not go on about
her sexuality, please?

159
00:08:47,815 --> 00:08:50,620
- Thank you.
- Let's just stick to why she's so fat.

160
00:08:54,469 --> 00:08:55,371
Anna.

161
00:08:55,531 --> 00:08:56,723
Lost cause.

162
00:08:59,368 --> 00:09:01,427
- Hello, Rosie.
- Hey, Anna! Hi.

163
00:09:02,788 --> 00:09:05,337
Do you have any advice
for people like me who are on

164
00:09:05,544 --> 00:09:09,469
different diets year after year
and never seem to lose any weight?

165
00:09:09,629 --> 00:09:13,730
You know, the important thing, Anna,
is that you're healthy and happy.

166
00:09:13,850 --> 00:09:15,433
Are you happy with your size?

167
00:09:16,010 --> 00:09:18,626
- Well...
- No, she's not. She's very fat, Rosie.

168
00:09:19,922 --> 00:09:21,522
I am happy with my size.

169
00:09:21,682 --> 00:09:24,563
Well, good for you!
That's great and you're beautiful.

170
00:09:24,826 --> 00:09:26,384
She's not a lesbian, Rosie.

171
00:09:33,537 --> 00:09:36,078
Right, let's think.
Another question.

172
00:09:37,573 --> 00:09:39,302
Yes, my illegal friend, yes.

173
00:09:41,287 --> 00:09:44,754
I often find I'm doing
really good with my diet,

174
00:09:45,258 --> 00:09:47,298
and then I go on myself

175
00:09:47,458 --> 00:09:50,092
and buy a big bar of chocolate.

176
00:09:50,930 --> 00:09:53,012
Rosie, what's your weakness?

177
00:09:53,433 --> 00:09:56,203
- Well...
- Couldn't understand a word!

178
00:09:56,503 --> 00:09:58,935
Sorry, Rosie, I should have
warned you, she's Philippino.

179
00:09:59,208 --> 00:10:00,935
- Mexican!
- Same thing, innit?

180
00:10:02,710 --> 00:10:04,161
Let's have another question.

181
00:10:04,281 --> 00:10:07,258
Let's have one from the
morbidly obese contingent.

182
00:10:08,062 --> 00:10:09,862
Yes, the dangerously
fat man over there.

183
00:10:10,624 --> 00:10:14,575
OK, you know what, Marjorie, I really
cannot believe how you treat people!

184
00:10:14,735 --> 00:10:17,762
You're absolutely rude!
You're homophobic! You're racist!

185
00:10:17,882 --> 00:10:19,352
You're meant to help these people

186
00:10:19,472 --> 00:10:22,792
and you keep ridiculing them
about their size! It's disgusting!

187
00:10:23,341 --> 00:10:25,723
And licking another
woman's vagina isn't?

188
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:36,693
<i>One thing Americans
can be very proud of</i>

189
00:10:37,007 --> 00:10:39,243
<i>is that they have
more death from firearms</i>

190
00:10:39,363 --> 00:10:41,340
<i>than any other country in the world.</i>

191
00:10:42,592 --> 00:10:44,021
The standard issue gun

192
00:10:44,181 --> 00:10:46,386
for anyone
in the Sheriff's department

193
00:10:47,118 --> 00:10:49,019
is a Colt 45.

194
00:10:50,503 --> 00:10:52,609
It's a simple blow-back pistol,

195
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:54,991
with a single action trigger.

196
00:10:55,151 --> 00:10:56,386
It's a good gun.

197
00:10:58,827 --> 00:11:00,602
The Winchester 70,

198
00:11:01,287 --> 00:11:03,305
this is a bolt-action rifle,

199
00:11:04,368 --> 00:11:07,005
which we'd use for
long-range coverage.

200
00:11:07,677 --> 00:11:10,817
Sure is a big heavy one,
but it shoots a good load.

201
00:11:13,965 --> 00:11:15,693
As you've probably realised,

202
00:11:16,106 --> 00:11:17,655
this is a machine-gun,

203
00:11:18,195 --> 00:11:20,172
the Bushmaster A3.

204
00:11:21,882 --> 00:11:25,730
You really gotta know what to do when
you hold a big powerful weapon like this

205
00:11:26,006 --> 00:11:27,443
or it'll spray everywhere.

206
00:11:30,382 --> 00:11:34,557
And finally, I thought y'all might
like to see one of my own guns.

207
00:11:35,168 --> 00:11:39,243
I've got a small personal
collection of 2,000 guns.

208
00:11:39,668 --> 00:11:40,832
This...

209
00:11:41,405 --> 00:11:43,841
is the Barrett 50 calibre,

210
00:11:44,461 --> 00:11:47,958
the biggest semi-automatic weapon
you can buy.

211
00:11:49,205 --> 00:11:50,458
It's a beast!

212
00:11:57,619 --> 00:11:59,555
I'm completely bored of guns now,

213
00:11:59,675 --> 00:12:02,239
I need to go and do something
totally different.

214
00:12:04,744 --> 00:12:07,666
<i>One thing that's currently
all the rage with teenagers,</i>

215
00:12:07,786 --> 00:12:11,150
<i>on both sides of the Atlantic,
is Grandmas.</i>

216
00:12:11,270 --> 00:12:14,481
<i>They're the latest must-have
fashion accessory.</i>

217
00:12:14,769 --> 00:12:16,752
<i>Those who don't have
their own Grandma</i>

218
00:12:16,872 --> 00:12:18,675
<i>can bid for one on eBay.</i>

219
00:12:19,407 --> 00:12:23,454
Now, what's all this your Mama
tells me about you being caught

220
00:12:23,614 --> 00:12:26,290
- smoking cigarettes?
- I was just trying it.

221
00:12:26,614 --> 00:12:28,959
Connor, cigarettes
are very bad for you.

222
00:12:29,368 --> 00:12:30,503
You used to smoke.

223
00:12:30,663 --> 00:12:32,879
Sure, when I was your age,
we all smoked.

224
00:12:33,011 --> 00:12:36,072
Used to say smoking was good for you,
we didn't know any different.

225
00:12:36,569 --> 00:12:38,067
I'm sorry, Grandma.

226
00:12:38,433 --> 00:12:39,832
Same with that cocaine,

227
00:12:40,105 --> 00:12:42,388
we just didn't know,
we thought it was a pick-me-up.

228
00:12:42,508 --> 00:12:45,518
I used to go around all day
hoovering up the booger sugar.

229
00:12:45,888 --> 00:12:47,853
- You took cocaine?
- Oh, sure!

230
00:12:48,095 --> 00:12:49,233
And heroin.

231
00:12:49,353 --> 00:12:51,891
Yeah, you used to get home
from church on a Sunday

232
00:12:52,011 --> 00:12:55,653
and your Grandpappy used to say,
"Mildred, let's chase that dragon!"

233
00:12:56,227 --> 00:13:00,157
We used to spend the rest of
the week out of our tiny minds.

234
00:13:00,621 --> 00:13:02,884
I never knew people
took drugs in them days.

235
00:13:03,147 --> 00:13:04,704
There's a lot you don't know!

236
00:13:04,864 --> 00:13:06,857
I've still got my old
crack pipe somewhere.

237
00:13:06,977 --> 00:13:09,917
Your Aunt Dorothy gave it
to me for my 18th birthday.

238
00:13:10,287 --> 00:13:12,420
Aunt Dorothy gave you a crack pipe?

239
00:13:12,748 --> 00:13:13,754
Sure she did!

240
00:13:13,874 --> 00:13:18,092
She even had it engraved:
"My face is on fire, yours, Dorothy."

241
00:13:18,860 --> 00:13:20,928
How could you take that stuff,
Grandma?

242
00:13:21,292 --> 00:13:23,565
We didn't know it was bad for you!

243
00:13:23,755 --> 00:13:26,621
Every morning we used to cook up
that crystal meth,

244
00:13:26,741 --> 00:13:29,247
we thought it was like
having a glass of milk.

245
00:13:29,528 --> 00:13:31,939
Is there anything you
didn't take in them days?

246
00:13:32,195 --> 00:13:35,080
Now let me see,
I did MDMA,

247
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:37,477
acid, GHB,

248
00:13:37,693 --> 00:13:40,988
magic mushrooms, glue, mescaline,

249
00:13:41,129 --> 00:13:42,491
poppers, Quaaludes,

250
00:13:42,651 --> 00:13:43,819
angel dust.

251
00:13:43,988 --> 00:13:45,161
You ever smoke pot?

252
00:13:45,605 --> 00:13:47,163
Pot's for pussies!

253
00:13:48,394 --> 00:13:50,791
Wow!
You've lived some life, Grandma.

254
00:13:51,564 --> 00:13:54,795
Considering you've taken all them drugs,
you don't look too bad on it.

255
00:13:55,557 --> 00:13:56,609
I'm 28!

256
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:02,778
<i>The Scouting movement
is very popular in America,</i>

257
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:05,877
<i>though it was started in Britain
by Lord Baden-Powell,</i>

258
00:14:05,997 --> 00:14:07,891
<i>who was keen to justify his hobby</i>

259
00:14:08,011 --> 00:14:10,808
<i>of sharing a tent
with young boys in uniform.</i>

260
00:14:11,230 --> 00:14:14,523
<i>This Scout pack is playing host
to retired astronaut:</i>

261
00:14:14,683 --> 00:14:15,768
<i>Bing Gordon.</i>

262
00:14:17,553 --> 00:14:19,543
<i>One small step for man,</i>

263
00:14:20,777 --> 00:14:23,669
<i>one giant leap for Bing Gordon!</i>

264
00:14:26,521 --> 00:14:27,875
<i>I'm on the moon!</i>

265
00:14:27,995 --> 00:14:31,135
<i>I'm on the Goddamn moon!</i>

266
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:37,598
So one day,

267
00:14:37,984 --> 00:14:40,876
you can all tell your grandkids
that you met Bing Gordon,

268
00:14:41,246 --> 00:14:43,052
the 8th man on the moon.

269
00:14:43,212 --> 00:14:45,137
Thank you, Bing, I'm sure we will.

270
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:50,174
OK, Pack, does anyone
have any questions?

271
00:14:50,344 --> 00:14:53,646
- Put your hands up, please. Nathan.
- How many people been to the moon?

272
00:14:53,899 --> 00:14:56,942
Nine men have been
to the moon, no women.

273
00:14:57,239 --> 00:14:58,564
I was the 8th.

274
00:15:00,216 --> 00:15:03,402
And I'm also the only man with
a moustache to have been to the moon,

275
00:15:03,522 --> 00:15:04,523
so, in a way,

276
00:15:04,643 --> 00:15:07,493
I can say I'm the first man
on the moon who had a moustache.

277
00:15:11,281 --> 00:15:12,546
Yes, Bradley.

278
00:15:12,884 --> 00:15:14,500
Have you ever met Neil Armstrong?

279
00:15:15,157 --> 00:15:17,986
Yeah, I know Neil,
but he's kind of a bore.

280
00:15:18,106 --> 00:15:20,216
You know,
"I was the first man on the moon!"

281
00:15:20,336 --> 00:15:21,715
Get over it! Move on!

282
00:15:22,876 --> 00:15:24,534
Yeah, you, freaky-looking boy.

283
00:15:25,087 --> 00:15:26,804
What's Buzz Aldrin like
in real life?

284
00:15:27,517 --> 00:15:28,517
Bitter!

285
00:15:29,511 --> 00:15:31,485
- Is he?
- Yeah, I actually trained at NASA

286
00:15:31,605 --> 00:15:32,884
with Neil and Buzz.

287
00:15:33,004 --> 00:15:36,188
I was passed over for the first moon
mission, but I've gotten over it.

288
00:15:36,703 --> 00:15:40,234
Maybe I would have been first
if I'd given the Head of NASA a blowjob.

289
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:45,063
- That's not really appropriate here.
- Well, it's true.

290
00:15:47,617 --> 00:15:51,287
Does anyone know the name
on the Apollo 11?

291
00:15:51,445 --> 00:15:53,245
Yeah, I do, Michael Collins.

292
00:15:54,372 --> 00:15:55,372
Right.

293
00:15:56,153 --> 00:15:57,918
- What's he doing now?
- Who cares?

294
00:15:58,378 --> 00:16:00,585
He didn't even get out of
he freakin' spaceship thing,

295
00:16:00,705 --> 00:16:02,698
he just sat there,
scratching his ass.

296
00:16:02,818 --> 00:16:05,428
I actually got out
and had a walk around, OK?

297
00:16:05,599 --> 00:16:07,289
Now, as far as I know,

298
00:16:07,487 --> 00:16:10,904
and correct me if I'm wrong,
I'm the only guy here who's done that.

299
00:16:11,073 --> 00:16:12,678
Have you walked on the moon?

300
00:16:13,805 --> 00:16:15,728
Have you walked on the moon?

301
00:16:16,134 --> 00:16:17,134
Have you...

302
00:16:19,965 --> 00:16:21,188
... rode on the moon?

303
00:16:22,644 --> 00:16:26,071
No! Hands up anyone here
who's been to the moon.

304
00:16:31,056 --> 00:16:32,107
Just me!

305
00:16:35,234 --> 00:16:36,319
George!

306
00:16:36,687 --> 00:16:37,805
You have a question.

307
00:16:38,510 --> 00:16:40,336
Have you been to any other planets?

308
00:16:42,538 --> 00:16:45,083
First up, the moon is not a planet.

309
00:16:45,271 --> 00:16:48,508
That's why it's called the moon,
it's a moon, the moon.

310
00:16:48,751 --> 00:16:52,047
Second, no-one has been
to any other planet,

311
00:16:52,188 --> 00:16:55,474
so it's not like I'm not the first guy
not to do that, OK?

312
00:16:55,698 --> 00:16:58,381
Third, I went to the moon, OK?

313
00:16:58,544 --> 00:16:59,859
I went there!

314
00:17:00,150 --> 00:17:02,790
I don't know why,
it's real boring, there's no TV,

315
00:17:02,910 --> 00:17:06,290
no stores, no restaurants, you can't
even get a decent cup of coffee.

316
00:17:06,509 --> 00:17:09,490
There's shit-all there,
but I went, to the moon!

317
00:17:11,391 --> 00:17:13,535
Thank you very much, Bing Gordon!

318
00:17:17,078 --> 00:17:19,078
Moon!

319
00:17:21,144 --> 00:17:23,293
Now, before you go,

320
00:17:24,385 --> 00:17:27,131
we would like to present you
with something special.

321
00:17:29,803 --> 00:17:33,825
In recognition of your achievement
in space exploration,

322
00:17:33,999 --> 00:17:37,685
Webster Grove Pack 315
would like to present you

323
00:17:37,845 --> 00:17:40,215
with the Cub Scout Explorer Badge.

324
00:17:43,391 --> 00:17:45,025
What a great honour!

325
00:17:46,038 --> 00:17:47,596
You're an asshole!

326
00:17:52,527 --> 00:17:55,748
<i>The number one pet in America today
is the dog,</i>

327
00:17:55,948 --> 00:17:57,496
<i>which is very much in demand</i>

328
00:17:57,656 --> 00:18:00,642
<i>with those who enjoy
picking up animal excrement.</i>

329
00:18:00,762 --> 00:18:04,055
It's a little bit chilly today,
isn't it, Mr Doggy?

330
00:18:04,374 --> 00:18:05,642
Oh, yes, Mommy.

331
00:18:06,683 --> 00:18:07,715
Maybe...

332
00:18:07,875 --> 00:18:11,650
Mommy needs to buy Mr Doggy
a little doggy coat

333
00:18:11,857 --> 00:18:14,472
to keep Mr Doggy nice and warm.

334
00:18:14,998 --> 00:18:17,195
Oh, yes, Mommy,
that would be wonderful.

335
00:18:17,458 --> 00:18:19,688
I do love you so much.

336
00:18:20,322 --> 00:18:22,563
And I love you too, Mr Doggy.

337
00:18:23,062 --> 00:18:24,690
Take off your clothes.

338
00:18:26,359 --> 00:18:27,359
Excuse me?

339
00:18:27,725 --> 00:18:29,486
I said, take off your clothes.

340
00:18:31,347 --> 00:18:33,585
No, Mr Doggy, it's cold

341
00:18:34,036 --> 00:18:36,797
and you're not allowed
to take your clothes off in public

342
00:18:37,003 --> 00:18:38,829
or they take you away
and lock you up.

343
00:18:39,247 --> 00:18:40,497
I said take 'em off.

344
00:18:40,845 --> 00:18:42,479
Now, listen, Mr Doggy,

345
00:18:42,648 --> 00:18:44,997
Mummy's had quite enough
of your silly ideas,

346
00:18:45,147 --> 00:18:46,837
you're going to get Mummy
into trouble.

347
00:18:47,222 --> 00:18:48,902
- Take 'em off!
- No!

348
00:18:50,159 --> 00:18:52,092
If you love me, you'd do it.

349
00:18:54,552 --> 00:18:55,566
Oh, well.

350
00:18:57,951 --> 00:18:59,359
Very quickly then.

351
00:19:04,765 --> 00:19:06,767
This is awfully embarrassing!

352
00:19:10,536 --> 00:19:11,570
Happy now?

353
00:19:12,142 --> 00:19:14,364
No. Go and stand in the trash.

354
00:19:14,879 --> 00:19:16,325
Certainly not!

355
00:19:16,976 --> 00:19:18,660
I won't tell you again.

356
00:19:31,029 --> 00:19:32,466
Is this what you wanted?

357
00:19:33,010 --> 00:19:35,137
Why on earth would anyone
want you to do that?

358
00:19:35,447 --> 00:19:37,346
Lady, you're outta your fuckin' mind!

359
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:41,017
Move outta the trash, please.

360
00:19:41,355 --> 00:19:42,567
Come on, lady.

361
00:19:45,975 --> 00:19:47,815
- My dog!
- I'm not with her!

362
00:19:48,088 --> 00:19:49,942
She is one crazy bitch!

363
00:19:52,733 --> 00:19:56,967
<i>More and more British people are
spending their holidays in America.</i>

364
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:59,287
<i>We enjoy the food, the weather</i>

365
00:19:59,418 --> 00:20:02,211
<i>and the fact that the dollar
is now worthless.</i>

366
00:20:02,606 --> 00:20:04,081
Happy anniversary!

367
00:20:04,498 --> 00:20:06,291
40 glorious years!

368
00:20:13,256 --> 00:20:14,645
Nice hotel, isn't it?

369
00:20:17,507 --> 00:20:19,237
Food will be along any minute, so...

370
00:20:19,357 --> 00:20:20,719
Oh, here it comes!

371
00:20:21,703 --> 00:20:23,374
Oh, no, somebody else's.

372
00:20:26,449 --> 00:20:27,726
Nice cutlery, innit?

373
00:20:32,272 --> 00:20:33,550
40 years.

374
00:20:35,161 --> 00:20:36,522
40 years of this, hey?

375
00:20:37,780 --> 00:20:39,010
Oh, here it comes.

376
00:20:39,424 --> 00:20:41,076
Hello there, that must be yours

377
00:20:41,236 --> 00:20:43,245
and putting mine down there, yeah.

378
00:20:43,912 --> 00:20:44,992
Don't go!

379
00:20:47,377 --> 00:20:48,956
Looks very nice, doesn't it?

380
00:20:49,076 --> 00:20:51,764
And all the food's been nice,
hasn't it, really?

381
00:20:52,416 --> 00:20:54,313
Might have a bit of the old beef,

382
00:20:54,801 --> 00:20:58,191
putting that on the fork now
and in it goes.

383
00:21:08,197 --> 00:21:10,105
Bit of a pause there while I chew.

384
00:21:13,477 --> 00:21:16,873
Think I might have a bit of the old
mash now, the old mashed potato.

385
00:21:17,434 --> 00:21:20,616
Putting it on the old fork,
using the knife to balance it

386
00:21:20,776 --> 00:21:23,243
on the fork and in it goes.

387
00:21:29,092 --> 00:21:32,247
Shorter pause on that occasion,
less need to chew.

388
00:21:33,872 --> 00:21:34,999
So...

389
00:21:38,052 --> 00:21:40,296
Help me out here,
you boring old cow!

390
00:21:44,182 --> 00:21:46,158
<i>People in Britain like to keep fit</i>

391
00:21:46,278 --> 00:21:49,167
<i>by taking long walks
and regular masturbation.</i>

392
00:21:49,806 --> 00:21:51,191
<i>Whereas in America,</i>

393
00:21:51,311 --> 00:21:54,091
<i>people like to attend gyms,
like this one.</i>

394
00:21:54,476 --> 00:21:56,133
Incredible workout!

395
00:21:56,390 --> 00:21:57,786
Incredible workout.

396
00:21:58,039 --> 00:22:00,982
So, did you close the deal
with that girl, last night?

397
00:22:01,499 --> 00:22:02,663
Which one?

398
00:22:03,598 --> 00:22:05,910
- The one you were with last night.
- Mo?

399
00:22:06,107 --> 00:22:08,032
The one you says looks like Gisele.

400
00:22:08,152 --> 00:22:10,736
She is exactly like her, man.
She's black

401
00:22:10,856 --> 00:22:12,220
and four foot six.

402
00:22:12,340 --> 00:22:15,754
But people ask her if she's
Gisele Bundchen, like, all the time.

403
00:22:17,976 --> 00:22:19,056
Nice.

404
00:22:21,056 --> 00:22:22,493
Double nice.

405
00:22:22,893 --> 00:22:24,762
So this black dwarf Gisele look-alike?

406
00:22:24,882 --> 00:22:26,640
- You gave it to her?
- She got it.

407
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:28,860
She got it good,
I gave it to her so hard.

408
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:30,644
I pounded her, man!

409
00:22:30,804 --> 00:22:32,003
Pounded her.

410
00:22:32,123 --> 00:22:35,186
I pounded her
for like nealy a minute.

411
00:22:36,189 --> 00:22:37,708
I had sex last month.

412
00:22:38,270 --> 00:22:40,070
On your own or with someone else?

413
00:22:40,668 --> 00:22:41,655
With a woman.

414
00:22:43,276 --> 00:22:44,835
I love sex with a woman.

415
00:22:44,955 --> 00:22:47,174
- It's one of my favourite kinds.
- Me too.

416
00:22:47,294 --> 00:22:49,120
I gave it to her,
I gave it to her real good.

417
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:51,015
She couldn't walk
when I was done with her.

418
00:22:51,306 --> 00:22:54,021
- She's the one in a wheelchair?
- That's the one, yeah.

419
00:22:54,141 --> 00:22:55,919
Man, she got it, she got it good.

420
00:22:56,079 --> 00:22:58,672
I bent her over, I was like,
"Can you take this, yeah?"

421
00:22:58,937 --> 00:23:00,215
"Can you take this bitch?"

422
00:23:04,842 --> 00:23:06,335
What are you looking at?

423
00:23:06,579 --> 00:23:07,653
Nothing.

424
00:23:08,649 --> 00:23:09,641
What are you?

425
00:23:09,801 --> 00:23:10,810
A fag?

426
00:23:13,002 --> 00:23:13,937
No.

427
00:23:16,612 --> 00:23:18,424
Hey, man, I'm going to the beach.

428
00:23:18,544 --> 00:23:20,690
- Can you do my bikini line?
- Sure.

429
00:23:30,301 --> 00:23:31,766
That guy is still looking.

430
00:23:32,423 --> 00:23:33,428
Fruit.

431
00:23:36,108 --> 00:23:39,357
<i>And so, our cultural exchange
is at an end.</i>

432
00:23:39,861 --> 00:23:41,263
<i>But what have we learnt?</i>

433
00:23:41,383 --> 00:23:45,093
<i>Well, that although the people
of our two great nations</i>

434
00:23:45,253 --> 00:23:46,643
<i>have many differences,</i>

435
00:23:46,831 --> 00:23:49,016
<i>we also have many differences.</i>

438
00:23:54,638 --> 00:23:58,317
