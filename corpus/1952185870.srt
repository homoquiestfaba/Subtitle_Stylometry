You look great. 
It's just that ... 

165

So I was thinking ... 

174
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:05,900
Perhaps it would be good 
travel together. 

175
00:15:05,901 --> 00:15:08,838
Step out 
that place. 

176
00:15:09,466 --> 00:15:11,948
Remember that time 
we were camping? 

177
00:15:11,949 --> 00:15:14,355
We were not camping, father. 
Lost in the forest. 

178
00:15:14,356 --> 00:15:16,724
Who ever camping 
has tent, water, food ... 

179
00:15:16,725 --> 00:15:21,308
This, camping. 
Like old times. 

180
00:15:21,309 --> 00:15:23,462
-They were good times ... 
-I gotta go. 

181
00:15:23,463 --> 00:15:25,184
I'm meeting 
with some friends. 

182
00:15:39,550 --> 00:15:41,050
Excuse me. 

183
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:45,430
-They are having a reunion? 
-Yes. 

184
00:15:47,650 --> 00:15:49,876
'm Not drinking 
for 28days. 

185
00:15:49,877 --> 00:15:51,949
Good stopping you. 

186
00:15:51,950 --> 00:15:53,450
Ross. 

187
00:15:59,213 --> 00:16:02,288
We have meetings all the time, 
if you are interested. 

188
00:16:02,289 --> 00:16:05,206
Sure. Come take a look 
of one hours. 

189
00:16:05,207 --> 00:16:07,959
Bright. 
We are here if you need. 

190
00:16:15,148 --> 00:16:16,788
Telephone! 

191
00:16:17,814 --> 00:16:20,644
Terry. House. 

192
00:16:32,983 --> 00:16:35,149
"Hello. 
-Terry! 

193
00:16:35,150 --> 00:16:36,760
You must come here! 

194
00:16:36,761 --> 00:16:38,586
Why are you crying? 

195
00:16:38,587 --> 00:16:42,266
My back is terrible. 
I need to come here. 

196
00:16:42,267 --> 00:16:45,999
Again? 
Try to ask God for help. 

197
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,499
He did not attend, 
You do. 

198
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:50,966
<i> I'm lying on the ground. 
Come here. 

199
00:16:56,550 --> 00:16:58,050
Terry! 

200
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:21,935
After 7years, perhaps 
time to examine it. 

201
00:17:23,613 --> 00:17:27,043
I was examined, but 
obviously to no avail. 

202
00:17:27,044 --> 00:17:29,492
I take a picture 
for your fan club? 

203
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:34,353
Thank 
turn off the music. 

204
00:17:35,149 --> 00:17:37,636
Seriously. Thank you. 
Now ... 

205
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:40,000
Help me. 

206
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:43,499
Know ... 

207
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:46,494
I was nothing 
when I found your book. 

208
00:17:47,855 --> 00:17:50,477
Indeed, it was only 
a bunch of gibberish. 

209
00:17:50,478 --> 00:17:53,457
Sitting in a coffee table, 
partying do not know what. 

210
00:17:53,458 --> 00:17:56,999
Conveniently, no one wanted 
talk to me, so I felt. 

211
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,500
And read. 

212
00:18:00,316 --> 00:18:01,816
It was sensational. 

213
00:18:02,703 --> 00:18:04,203
You gave me a career. 

214
00:18:04,939 --> 00:18:06,992
It changed my life. 

215
00:18:06,993 --> 00:18:08,357
And now it does not help you 

216
00:18:08,358 --> 00:18:10,329
will probably 
poop pants. 

217
00:18:10,330 --> 00:18:11,832
Agree. 
Help me. 

218
00:18:11,833 --> 00:18:13,881
You are a disaster, Arlen. 

219
00:18:13,882 --> 00:18:15,804
And lately it is not 
my only. 

220
00:18:15,805 --> 00:18:18,344
I am successful, 
then I have several. 

221
00:18:18,345 --> 00:18:21,411
Will have some respite 
before the end of the story? 

222
00:18:21,412 --> 00:18:24,292
What did you think of the book that I sent 
for the 20a anniversary. 

223
00:18:24,293 --> 00:18:25,829
-Like? 
Not now, Terry. 

224
00:18:25,830 --> 00:18:28,679
Like cover 
with golden letters? 

225
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:30,899
I loved the golden letters. 
Adorei! 

226
00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:32,828
And the picture? 

227
00:18:32,829 --> 00:18:37,994
For the love of God. No matter! 
It's all nonsense unimportant! 

228
00:18:37,995 --> 00:18:39,999
Not unimportant 
asshole! 

229
00:18:41,550 --> 00:18:43,594
I will not help you, 
if not help me. 

230
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:47,499
Okay. 

231
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:49,000
You win. 

232
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:53,310
I loved the golden letters 
and the picture was fantastic. 

233
00:18:55,850 --> 00:18:56,939
Now help me. 

234
00:18:56,940 --> 00:18:58,449
You have no photos. 

235
00:18:58,450 --> 00:18:59,950
And the letters were blue. 

236
00:19:28,850 --> 00:19:30,350
Remem <i>! 

237
00:19:54,201 --> 00:19:55,925

Seems I planned this?

So it is a 
new patient. 

244

wonderful. 

290

No one has ever done this before. 
Nobody.

How did it? 

292
00:24:59,300 --> 00:25:01,622
I do not know. You still 
through inadequate.

next in the evolutionary chain.

How much do I owe you? 

295
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:19,874
2hours, $ 175.

-Accepted.

I knew it! 
You are Arlen Faber. 

313

I've read "Me and God" 40times.

My mother in heaven. 
I can not believe it! My God.

I feel I'm hitting 
the hand of God in person.

Can I ask a question? 

317
00:26:53,128 --> 00:26:55,335
Yes, I will pray for you. 
Believe me. 

318

Please only one. 

320
00:26:59,156 --> 00:27:02,607
One question. 
Under the condition that ever

356
00:29:24,921 --> 00:29:26,421
That's better.

Terrible!

Elizabeth is going to meet 
in a minute, Mr. Faber. 

365
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:31,000
I think I can 
sit. 

366
00:30:52,006 --> 00:30:53,506
What? 

367
00:30:57,262 --> 00:30:59,858
It has a lot of tension 
back today. 

368
00:30:59,859 --> 00:31:02,127
I was running the other day. 
It took me a crush. 

369
00:31:04,445 --> 00:31:07,262
I was there for a few minutes. 
I'll be back soon. 

370

Stay. 

371

Talk to me. 

372
00:31:15,262 --> 00:31:16,762
About what you want to talk? 

373
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:18,900
Let's talk about you. 

374
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:25,055
I moved here 
San Francisco. 

375
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:30,648
The place is new. 
I just open. 

376
00:31:31,942 --> 00:31:34,350
"I have a child of 7years. 
Filho? 

377
00:31:35,232 --> 00:31:37,199
I love children. 

378
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:40,373
People baixinhas and emotional 
do not know anything. 

379
00:31:40,374 --> 00:31:43,680
They have their creativity 
and imagination to survive. 

380
00:31:43,681 --> 00:31:46,914
In a world 
full of giants. 

381
00:31:49,300 --> 00:31:51,656
This is lovely. 
I never thought that way. 

382
00:31:54,745 --> 00:31:57,222
I? Not want to hear 
my story? 

383
00:31:59,900 --> 00:32:01,400
Want to. 

384
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:04,900
Great, thanks. 

385
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:08,225
I moved to Philadelphia 
10years ago. 

386
00:32:08,226 --> 00:32:10,126
I'm trying to write 
a book about 

387
00:32:10,127 --> 00:32:12,799
the history of monsters 
in films and literature. 

388
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:16,047
One day I hope to find a cure 
people who listen to techno. 

389
00:32:20,300 --> 00:32:21,999
I read your book. 

390
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:25,173
Great! 
I mean, thanks. 

391
00:32:27,550 --> 00:32:30,800
I do not know what to expect, 
But it was not that. 

392
00:32:32,387 --> 00:32:35,492
-Is that good? 
-Yes. Is. 

393
00:32:37,776 --> 00:32:40,259
Were one of the best 
answers I've ever heard. 

394
00:32:42,347 --> 00:32:44,073
It's beautiful. Really. 

395
00:32:48,650 --> 00:32:50,313
God still speaks to you? 

396
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:54,115
Now more than ever. 

397
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:16,849
Father! I burritos 
for breakfast. Want? 

398
00:34:16,850 --> 00:34:18,577
No thanks. 

399
00:34:18,578 --> 00:34:20,268
Just coffee. 

400
00:34:33,507 --> 00:34:35,394
Tastes like 
angels net. 

401
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:45,239
Things are not going well at the store, 
not? 

402
00:34:45,240 --> 00:34:47,743
It is nothing alarming. 
At least for now. 

403
00:34:49,155 --> 00:34:52,331
Still going às meetings 
Alcoholics Anonymous? 

404
00:34:54,611 --> 00:34:58,999
Some. Good. 
But às sometimes do not know ... 

405
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,500
I do not know. 

406
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:03,374
There's lots 
whining, I think. 

407
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:09,292
I went to one once. 

408
00:35:10,313 --> 00:35:12,511
The people there 
made me feel 

409
00:35:12,512 --> 00:35:15,109
like the luckiest guy 
the world, you know? 

410
00:35:15,110 --> 00:35:16,610
Understand. 

411
00:35:18,050 --> 00:35:21,733
If you want to go again, I 
schedule one for you.

Appearances and book signing,

451
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:05,750
We just want to write 
a little about the subject. 

452
00:38:05,751 --> 00:38:08,138
What's so complicated? 

453
00:38:08,139 --> 00:38:10,273
Try any time 
and find out for yourself. 

454
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:26,294

I'll give you my phone.

In the case of being 
busy, 

458
00:38:37,387 --> 00:38:39,996
and need to cancel 
some query. That's why. 

459
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:52,749
It even has a boyfriend? 

460
00:38:52,750 --> 00:38:54,250
No. 

461

If he had, I

Good. 

464
00:39:10,808 --> 00:39:12,308
Want to take a walk? 

465
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:26,255
Another day, another round 
with a famous writer. 

466
00:39:27,218 --> 00:39:29,585
-You must be exhausted. 
-No idea. 

467
00:39:35,700 --> 00:39:38,584
I would not be breaking 
no doctor-patient rule. 

468
00:39:38,585 --> 00:39:40,705
No, this is 
part of the service. 

469
00:39:44,100 --> 00:39:46,449
I only have 3rules. 

470
00:39:46,450 --> 00:39:49,675
Do not take advice from someone 
with whom they trade places. " 

471
00:39:49,676 --> 00:39:52,279
"Try not to do things 
that might regret. " 

472
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:55,140
And "one thing is what it is 
and not something else. " 

473
00:39:56,500 --> 00:39:59,663
I forgot what my, but has 
something to do with gangs. 

474
00:40:06,393 --> 00:40:09,090
This is a street where I 
probably never going to live. 

475
00:40:09,091 --> 00:40:11,012
You never know. 
Anything can happen. 

476
00:40:11,013 --> 00:40:13,059
Is. For now 
look costs nothing. 

477
00:40:13,779 --> 00:40:15,279
You know what he says. 

478
00:40:16,751 --> 00:40:18,727
No. Certainly 
do not know. 

479
00:40:19,521 --> 00:40:22,405
"For you and only you, 
I made this place. " 

480
00:40:22,406 --> 00:40:25,849
"Full of wonders 
to keep your eyes open, " 

481
00:40:25,850 --> 00:40:28,049
"As I turn the world." 

482
00:40:30,700 --> 00:40:32,785
Not remember seeing 
in this book. 

483
00:41:00,389 --> 00:41:02,433
-Excuse me. 
-Yes. 

484
00:41:02,434 --> 00:41:04,168
Know where 
Arlen Faber live? 

485
00:41:04,901 --> 00:41:06,401
Sei. 

486
00:41:07,284 --> 00:41:10,590
-2038, Down 5blocks. 
-Thanks. 

487
00:41:10,591 --> 00:41:13,006
She threw water on my family. 
-How? 

488
00:41:13,656 --> 00:41:17,044
We were singing to him 
and he threw a bucket of water. 

489
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:19,615
Careful with it. 

490
00:41:19,616 --> 00:41:22,702
May have written "Me and God" 
but he will not read. 

491
00:41:34,163 --> 00:41:35,649
So you're Arlen Faber? 

492
00:41:35,650 --> 00:41:38,322
I had no idea that I was 
so beautiful, is not it? 

493
00:41:38,323 --> 00:41:39,874
-I like your book. 
I know. 

494
00:41:39,875 --> 00:41:41,579
But I 
be honest with you. 

495
00:41:42,623 --> 00:41:45,293
-Talk. 
"I can not accept more books. 

496
00:41:45,294 --> 00:41:47,580
But it seems that you really want 
get rid of some. 

497
00:41:47,581 --> 00:41:48,933
Have you noticed, right? 

498
00:41:48,934 --> 00:41:50,434
I want to make a deal. 

499
00:41:51,700 --> 00:41:55,849
You give good advice às times. 
Even being as crazy as it is.

500
00:41:55,850 --> 00:41:57,650
So, here goes 
what I propose. 

501
00:41:57,651 --> 00:41:59,999
Lets you change your books 
for questions. 

502
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:03,320
I have a question. You aware 
how I hate this idea? 

503
00:42:05,285 --> 00:42:10,463
More than hate each 
practicing yoga fanatic 

504
00:42:10,464 --> 00:42:13,040
going à my shop 
knowing where you live? 

505
00:42:15,063 --> 00:42:18,311
Three books per visit 
and nobody knows where you live. 

506
00:42:19,262 --> 00:42:21,213
Less costly 
the family that you water. 

507
00:42:35,236 --> 00:42:38,211
Five books and can not 
argue with me. 

508
00:42:38,212 --> 00:42:40,261
You ask, I answer. 
That's it. 

509
00:42:40,262 --> 00:42:41,289
Closed. 

510
00:42:41,290 --> 00:42:44,564
If we end up with the bargain, 
would like to enter 

511
00:42:44,565 --> 00:42:46,569
and surrender à life 
I had before. 

512
00:42:46,570 --> 00:42:48,599
-Still not ask ... 
-Asked, yes. 

513
00:42:58,657 --> 00:43:01,956
-How are you today? 
"Well. 

514
00:43:01,957 --> 00:43:03,999
Half broken, but better. 

515
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:05,769
You? 

516
00:43:05,770 --> 00:43:10,605
-I'm fine. Okay. 
-And why? 

517
00:43:10,606 --> 00:43:13,779
Yesterday, my son took 
4in the proof, 

518
00:43:13,780 --> 00:43:15,667
and I was very happy. 

519
00:43:16,517 --> 00:43:19,735
What happened to the "A"? 
Why the "1" is not perfect? 

520
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:22,088
Have no idea. 

521
00:43:22,089 --> 00:43:23,814
One in three. 

522
00:43:23,815 --> 00:43:25,374
One 

523
00:43:25,375 --> 00:43:26,949
Two. 

524
00:43:26,950 --> 00:43:28,450
Three. 

525
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:33,900
I would like to meet him? 

526
00:43:35,570 --> 00:43:37,392
Alex, this is 
my friend, Arlen. 

527
00:43:38,353 --> 00:43:40,095
Arlen, this is Alex. 

528
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,473
I heard on the street which had a 4, 
true? 

529
00:43:43,474 --> 00:43:45,563
Yes 

530
00:43:45,564 --> 00:43:47,384
-Congratulations. 
-Thanks. 

531
00:43:47,385 --> 00:43:49,526
-It was nice to meet you. 
"You too. 

532
00:43:52,208 --> 00:43:53,708
Be right back. 

533
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:00,820
Grande-boy. 
-Is. Thank you. 

534
00:44:03,450 --> 00:44:06,365
Want to know something about legal 
tighten the hand of the small? 

535
00:44:08,850 --> 00:44:12,156
They see us shaking hands, 
but do not know that squeeze. 

536
00:44:12,157 --> 00:44:15,463
So, are holding his hand 
a few seconds. 

537
00:44:16,070 --> 00:44:18,259
-That's cool. 
-Yes, it is. 

538
00:44:21,300 --> 00:44:22,800
See you soon. 

539
00:44:37,400 --> 00:44:39,801
Why is everybody 
squeezing my hand? 

540
00:44:51,850 --> 00:44:54,199
Why can not I do 
things I want? 

541
00:44:54,200 --> 00:44:57,491
There is so much that I know I am 
able, but never do. Why? 

542
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:01,179
It is hard to see that always 
do you want. 

543
00:45:01,180 --> 00:45:03,948
Ever. One is 
forcing you to anything. 

544
00:45:03,949 --> 00:45:05,922
When you see this, 
realize that it is free, 

545
00:45:05,923 --> 00:45:07,995
and that life is only 
a set of choices. 

546
00:45:07,996 --> 00:45:10,119
Nothing happens to you. 
You choose. 

547
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:20,104
There are 7books here. 

548
00:45:20,105 --> 00:45:22,518
Penalty pre-coffee. 
2more books. 

549
00:45:28,005 --> 00:45:31,073
If God created everything, 
why are things bad? 

550
00:45:31,074 --> 00:45:33,911
As pain and suffering, 
example. 

551
00:45:33,912 --> 00:45:36,509
Opposites. 
Without bad things, 

552
00:45:36,510 --> 00:45:39,507
not know what is good 
and would be adrift. 

553
00:45:39,508 --> 00:45:41,984
Smells of shit 
and go the opposite way. 

554
00:45:57,392 --> 00:46:00,183
I have a destiny? 
Or everything is free will? 

555
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:03,500
Fate or free will? 

556
00:46:04,405 --> 00:46:07,077
Free will move 
toward a purpose. 

557
00:46:21,313 --> 00:46:24,323
<i> Hello. It's Sitting up, 
Treatment Center? Is Arlen. 

558
00:46:25,100 --> 00:46:26,293
Elizabeth. 

559
00:46:26,294 --> 00:46:29,635
I feel that our tour 
was very short that day. 

560
00:46:29,636 --> 00:46:32,372
I called you to walk, 
but did not last much 

561
00:46:32,373 --> 00:46:35,688
and usually last 
these trips ... 

562
00:46:35,689 --> 00:46:38,975
Typically 
I do not give tours. 

563
00:46:38,976 --> 00:46:40,476
Forget the protocol. 

564
00:46:41,143 --> 00:46:42,187
What am I talking about? 

565
00:46:42,188 --> 00:46:44,371
I know that there 
no protocol ... 

566
00:46:44,372 --> 00:46:47,355
I mean, how would it be? 
What could be? 

567
00:46:47,356 --> 00:46:50,472
Crap! I hate to talk 
machines for a reason. 

568
00:46:50,473 --> 00:46:53,748
They are like life. 
Do not get anything back. 

569
00:46:55,400 --> 00:46:58,456
I like to go out with you ... 
I would like to go out with you. 

570
00:46:58,457 --> 00:47:00,491

Pass again.

I want her to like me.

Wisdom is like <i> 
a fox in winter. 

586
00:47:42,638 --> 00:47:44,931
<i> E is the ice 
he dances. 

587
00:47:55,843 --> 00:47:58,504
Kris, I must leave now. 

588
00:47:58,505 --> 00:48:00,736
I have no time to say 
why we dream. 

589
00:48:00,737 --> 00:48:02,868
Or help you get sanity. 
Maybe tomorrow. 

590
00:48:02,869 --> 00:48:05,680
I'm trying to stay sober. 
And my father did not return to drinking. 

591
00:48:05,681 --> 00:48:08,679
How do I love him, even 
he is selfish and scare me? 

592
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:14,500
This is difficult. 

593
00:48:16,203 --> 00:48:19,352
I think your expectations 
are on the road. 

594
00:48:20,600 --> 00:48:23,252
If he did such a thing, 
you'd be happy. 

595
00:48:23,253 --> 00:48:24,753
That is not how it works. 

596
00:48:25,645 --> 00:48:28,757
I think we should let it go 
and whatever may happen. 

597
00:48:28,758 --> 00:48:31,069
Or maybe not. 

598
00:48:31,070 --> 00:48:32,954
Anyway, 
will get better. 

599
00:48:35,800 --> 00:48:38,748
And should go às meetings 
of Alcoholics Anonymous. 

600
00:48:38,749 --> 00:48:41,568
It's hard. 
-Yes it is. 

601
00:48:46,250 --> 00:48:48,005
So, give me 
a book? 

602
00:48:50,500 --> 00:48:52,167
I double 
next time. 

603
00:48:54,851 --> 00:48:56,976
Sorry, about when 
met. 

604
00:48:56,977 --> 00:49:00,541
The comment of strip 
Festival of Piercing. 

605
00:49:00,542 --> 00:49:02,918
I did not know was 
through so much. 

606
00:49:03,665 --> 00:49:06,066
Then only is horrible 
with people without problems? 

607
00:49:06,930 --> 00:49:08,430
Good to know. 

608
00:49:17,300 --> 00:49:20,542
<i> need to take control 
of my life. 

609
00:49:20,543 --> 00:49:23,276
I need to take control 
of my life. 

610
00:49:40,200 --> 00:49:42,437
Thought I heard you. 
What are you doing? 

611
00:49:44,290 --> 00:49:48,401
Stretching. Was 
me stretching before hitting. 

612
00:49:50,394 --> 00:49:51,894
Anne, we are going. 

613
00:49:56,450 --> 00:49:58,912
-Hi, Arlen. 
-Hi, Alex. 

614
00:50:01,601 --> 00:50:03,499
Hi, Anne. 

615
00:50:03,500 --> 00:50:05,413
-You are multitasking. 
-Yes. 

616
00:50:06,750 --> 00:50:08,441
-Be nice to Annie. 
-Right. 

617
00:50:08,442 --> 00:50:12,210
Mommy will give you a kiss, 
when you return. Do not be late. 

618
00:50:12,211 --> 00:50:14,782
You know what to do. 
Anything sweet, only popcorn. 

619
00:50:14,783 --> 00:50:17,199
Call if you need anything. 
Use the flavoring. 

620
00:50:17,200 --> 00:50:20,049
-Has bulbs. 
-You are crazy. 

621
00:50:20,050 --> 00:50:21,550
He realized? 

622
00:50:23,159 --> 00:50:24,910
Not yet. 
What? 

623
00:50:25,750 --> 00:50:27,250
Nothing. 

624
00:50:28,033 --> 00:50:30,516
And has a few more things 
I wrote here. 

625
00:50:30,517 --> 00:50:31,735
I've done it ... 

626
00:50:31,736 --> 00:50:33,236
-Before. 
-I love you, honey. 

627
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:35,500
-Te amo. 
-I love you too, Mom. 

628
00:50:36,700 --> 00:50:38,325
I love you. 

629
00:50:40,957 --> 00:50:41,957
Have fun! 

630
00:50:41,958 --> 00:50:44,439
It should bring supplies 
the coming days. 

631
00:50:44,440 --> 00:50:46,100
Try to stand there. 

632
00:50:56,446 --> 00:50:57,946
You're beautiful. 

633
00:50:59,326 --> 00:51:00,826
Thank you. 

634
00:51:03,272 --> 00:51:05,117
Take me out, Arlen. 

635
00:51:31,400 --> 00:51:33,216
That's great. 

636
00:51:33,217 --> 00:51:36,127
I bet that is where are 
all your chiropractic. 

637
00:51:36,800 --> 00:51:38,300
Obvious? 

638
00:51:40,052 --> 00:51:42,657
Then, as became 
the angel of alignment? 

639
00:51:46,850 --> 00:51:51,466
I had to start over. 
To change. 

640
00:51:52,159 --> 00:51:53,869
And I like 
the urgency of this. 

641
00:51:53,870 --> 00:51:56,749
People come, 
às sometimes creeping, with pain. 

642
00:51:56,750 --> 00:51:58,453
And when they leave 
feel better. 

643
00:51:58,454 --> 00:51:59,499
For my sake. 

644
00:51:59,500 --> 00:52:01,000
And a legend was born. 

645
00:52:02,204 --> 00:52:04,836
Advances that have a talent 
if not shared? 

646
00:52:04,837 --> 00:52:06,873
Glad we 
that in common. 

647
00:52:08,656 --> 00:52:10,418
The incredible chiropractic. 

648
00:52:11,128 --> 00:52:12,628
The incredible ... 

649
00:52:14,676 --> 00:52:17,358
Writer thoughts 
outer space. 

650
00:52:22,500 --> 00:52:24,323
Tell me about Alexander. 

651
00:52:24,324 --> 00:52:27,483
Alex. 
He hates Alexander. Alex. 

652
00:52:28,450 --> 00:52:30,142
He is one amazing kid. 

653
00:52:30,143 --> 00:52:33,799
He keeps me up 
just to be near. 

654
00:52:33,800 --> 00:52:35,829
How often 
He sees the Father? 

655
00:52:41,900 --> 00:52:44,816
He does not see his father 
3years ago. 

656
00:52:46,006 --> 00:52:47,506
What happened? 

657
00:52:52,196 --> 00:52:54,597
Alex's father was ... 

658
00:52:54,598 --> 00:52:57,799
One of those guys 
who always has a good idea. 

659
00:52:57,800 --> 00:52:59,300
And for a time, 

660
00:53:00,323 --> 00:53:01,823
this idea was us. 

661
00:53:02,790 --> 00:53:06,715
Then one day, 
He took Alex to the park 

662
00:53:06,716 --> 00:53:09,088
and said he needed 
go away for a while 

663
00:53:09,089 --> 00:53:11,460
but again 
in 2weeks. 

664
00:53:11,461 --> 00:53:12,801
Weeks. 

665
00:53:12,802 --> 00:53:14,582
And in the end was 3years. 

666
00:53:15,550 --> 00:53:18,164
Alex was so small 
I hope ... 

667
00:53:19,170 --> 00:53:20,670
he has forgotten. 

668
00:53:21,550 --> 00:53:23,908
Mean, 
I should have guessed. 

669
00:53:23,909 --> 00:53:25,099
No! 

670
00:53:25,100 --> 00:53:26,699
-Okay? 
-Shit! 

671
00:53:28,306 --> 00:53:29,806
Do not move. 

672
00:53:33,850 --> 00:53:35,554
If you do not stop playing 
this song 

673
00:53:35,555 --> 00:53:37,495
I cut my wrists. 

674
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:49,500
Where were we? 

675
00:53:50,800 --> 00:53:53,965
"I think I bored ... 
-No, no. 

676
00:53:53,966 --> 00:53:54,966
Sorry. 

677
00:53:54,967 --> 00:53:56,956
It's a nice place, 
'm ruining everything. 

678
00:53:56,957 --> 00:53:58,457
No, I'm listening. 

679
00:53:59,465 --> 00:54:00,965
He is listening. 

680
00:54:04,469 --> 00:54:05,560
What do you hear? 

681
00:54:05,561 --> 00:54:09,036
Want to hear what I'm anxious, 
I do not do enough? 

682
00:54:09,037 --> 00:54:10,770
I lose control 
all the time? 

683
00:54:10,771 --> 00:54:14,598
I'm afraid not 
doing enough and that fear 

684
00:54:14,599 --> 00:54:17,838
me into something that did not return 
I want to be and can not stop. 

685
00:54:17,839 --> 00:54:21,419
No idea how 
be pressed all the time. 

686
00:54:21,420 --> 00:54:26,200
Not for Alex, but the idea 
that I am not enough. 

687
00:54:28,700 --> 00:54:30,200
He knows. 

688
00:54:32,250 --> 00:54:36,703
And he wants you to know is 
enough and more. 

689
00:54:36,704 --> 00:54:39,482
You are here for God 
can experience the world 

690
00:54:39,483 --> 00:54:41,401
through their eyes. 

691
00:54:41,402 --> 00:54:44,634
See what you see. 
Feel what you feel. 

692
00:54:44,635 --> 00:54:48,141
Every day, He can not wait 
to see what you will do. 

693
00:54:49,400 --> 00:54:52,792
What makes you laugh, what moves you. 
He can hardly wait. 

694
00:54:53,453 --> 00:54:57,867
Every day, through you, 
He falls in love with the world. 

695
00:55:00,936 --> 00:55:04,192
Elizabeth, you are 
His muse. 

696
00:55:11,500 --> 00:55:13,000
<i> Thanks. 

697
00:55:17,647 --> 00:55:21,286
Nossa, que lindo! 

698
00:55:21,287 --> 00:55:22,787
Yes, it is. 

699
00:55:22,788 --> 00:55:24,903
I bet that gives 
huge party here. 

700
00:55:26,022 --> 00:55:27,926
No one was here 
5years ago. 

701
00:55:29,900 --> 00:55:31,400
Five years? 

702
00:55:32,403 --> 00:55:33,903
Since 
my father died. 

703
00:55:34,800 --> 00:55:36,468
Sorry. 

704
00:55:37,806 --> 00:55:39,306
Me too. 

705
00:55:42,202 --> 00:55:43,702
Do not touch that! 

706
00:55:45,615 --> 00:55:47,115
I will not. 

707
00:55:48,600 --> 00:55:50,100
Let me show you something. 

708
00:56:09,576 --> 00:56:12,905
-This is my office. 
-I know, I saw the card. 

709
00:56:12,906 --> 00:56:14,331
Why so many boards? 

710
00:56:14,332 --> 00:56:16,507
Because my father had 
Alzheimer 

711
00:56:16,508 --> 00:56:19,283
and at the end was difficult for him 
remembering things. 

712
00:56:19,284 --> 00:56:21,288
Cards helped, 
for a while. 

713
00:56:29,500 --> 00:56:31,211
I collect. 

714
00:56:31,212 --> 00:56:33,815
My father and I watched 
monster movies together. 

715
00:56:33,816 --> 00:56:36,819
When I put some 
was a child, and over time, 

716
00:56:36,820 --> 00:56:41,801
get at garage sales or 
exhibitions of science fiction. 

717
00:56:43,004 --> 00:56:46,731
I really like them. 
I think I have a beautiful collection. 

718
00:56:48,600 --> 00:56:51,249
If you like that sort of thing. 
Perhaps not. 

719
00:56:51,250 --> 00:56:54,388
Not everyone likes. It's kind of stupid. 
It is better to walk away. 

720
00:56:54,389 --> 00:56:56,138
No, I loved it. 

721
00:56:58,913 --> 00:57:01,310
-Sao wonderful. 
-Really? 

722
00:57:04,300 --> 00:57:07,106
But it's crowded. 
Better get that here. 

723
00:57:07,107 --> 00:57:08,861
Sure, there's room. 

724
00:57:10,100 --> 00:57:11,600
Where you going? 

725
00:57:16,740 --> 00:57:19,153
Ready. There is better. 

726
00:57:19,154 --> 00:57:21,805
I do not want him there, 
I want him back with the others. 

727
00:57:22,982 --> 00:57:26,922
Sure. Just give it a try. 
Consider as an experiment. 

728
00:57:32,603 --> 00:57:34,114
Thanks for 
bring here. 

729
00:57:36,760 --> 00:57:38,260
Caught me off guard 
today. 

730
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:40,500
Tell me ... 

731
00:57:41,514 --> 00:57:44,481
I am the first girl to do 
their monsters? 

732
00:57:45,300 --> 00:57:48,315
Sorry. 
Give me just a second. 

733
00:57:52,106 --> 00:57:53,606
Do not run away. 

734
00:57:57,600 --> 00:57:59,525
I am ruining everything 
again, is not it? 

735
00:58:00,676 --> 00:58:04,300
Imagine. Love when 
I kiss someone 

736
00:58:04,301 --> 00:58:07,125
and he leaves to protect 
the plastic toy. 

737
00:58:11,600 --> 00:58:15,801
But I kiss better 
knowing that they are safe. 

738
00:58:29,078 --> 00:58:31,650
I remember what it made me. 
Understand? 

739
00:58:32,584 --> 00:58:35,737
It's just a choir, right? 
It's not about life or death. 

740
00:58:35,738 --> 00:58:38,106
At one time, 
if someone left me aside, 

741
00:58:38,107 --> 00:58:39,398
I isolated for 3days. 

742
00:58:39,399 --> 00:58:43,403
Now? I pray in silence 
the death of them. 

743
00:58:49,800 --> 00:58:52,200
Hi My name is Ross 
and I am an alcoholic. 

744
00:58:52,201 --> 00:58:53,701
-Hello, Ross. 
-Hello, Ross. 

745
00:58:54,474 --> 00:58:58,672
It seems our time is up, 
if nobody wants to say anything. 

746
00:59:00,400 --> 00:59:01,894
And you? 

747
00:59:01,895 --> 00:59:03,395
The beginner. 

748
00:59:08,513 --> 00:59:10,458
Shall I say something? 

749
00:59:11,817 --> 00:59:13,317
How about this? 

750
00:59:14,600- --> 00:59:16,616
I hate that shit. 

751
00:59:16,617 --> 00:59:18,482
I hate to be here. 

752
00:59:19,200 --> 00:59:22,531
I hate you 
and their stories pathetic. 

753
00:59:22,532 --> 00:59:24,399
I do not believe 
did I get here. 

754
00:59:24,400 --> 00:59:26,046
That sucks. 

755
00:59:26,047 --> 00:59:27,870
I'm in deep shit. 

756
00:59:27,871 --> 00:59:29,499
And you are also. 

757
00:59:34,800 --> 00:59:36,262
Look, I have a 
great plan. 

758
00:59:36,263 --> 00:59:39,075
Let's go walking at night 
knocking down pedestrians. 

759
00:59:39,076 --> 00:59:41,165
Playing back 
people on the ground. 

760
00:59:41,166 --> 00:59:43,419
It is hard work, 
war needs soldiers. 

761
00:59:44,100 --> 00:59:47,061
That looks great. 
When we? 

762
00:59:47,838 --> 00:59:50,499
Good luck on the moon 
We always knew that I could. 

763
00:59:50,500 --> 00:59:52,000
Thank you. 

764
00:59:54,744 --> 00:59:57,399
I think he 
is safe. 

765
00:59:57,400 --> 00:59:58,964
Goofing 
with my face? 

766
00:59:59,711 --> 01:00:03,948
No, I'm enjoying with the face 
chair of the Inquisition. 

767
01:00:03,949 --> 01:00:06,334
Once handle 
and make him confess. 

768
01:00:07,577 --> 01:00:09,077
Keep it safe. 

769
01:00:11,489 --> 01:00:13,387
-See you later. 
-Right. 

770
01:00:26,116 --> 01:00:28,764
So how is this business 
of heaven and hell? 

771
01:00:28,765 --> 01:00:31,680
I have seen hell. 
His name is Reno, Nevada. 

772
01:00:35,300 --> 01:00:37,436
I do not believe that God 
punish people 

773
01:00:37,437 --> 01:00:40,492
-for not believing in him. 
-The rapture. 

774
01:00:41,500 --> 01:00:42,810
What is this? 

775
01:00:42,811 --> 01:00:45,453
I like to think it 
as a movie monster. 

776
01:00:45,454 --> 01:00:48,984
The monster destroys some 
and save others. 

777
01:00:49,931 --> 01:00:51,696
And who is the monster? 

778
01:00:52,700 --> 01:00:54,630
God. 

779
01:00:54,631 --> 01:00:56,217
God is the monster. 

780
01:01:02,530 --> 01:01:04,784
Chiropractic has made 
lately? 

781
01:01:04,785 --> 01:01:06,746
<i> Sitting up, 
Treatment Center. 

782
01:01:07,747 --> 01:01:09,790
As you 
as it straightens. 

783
01:01:09,791 --> 01:01:12,069
"Impossible. 
Straightening-up. 

784
01:01:12,746 --> 01:01:14,439
It was in chiropractic 
lately? 

785
01:01:14,440 --> 01:01:15,940
What are you doing? 

786
01:01:17,100 --> 01:01:19,613
Elizabeth said that we need 
attract customers. 

787
01:01:19,614 --> 01:01:21,895
Nobody wants to talk 
with a spine. 

788
01:01:21,896 --> 01:01:24,965
-Discount offer. 
-Spine? 

789
01:01:24,966 --> 01:01:26,466
I do not care. 

790
01:01:28,150 --> 01:01:30,662
-Spine? 
She makes you see here. 

791
01:01:30,663 --> 01:01:32,280
Until next week, 
Mr. Macwan. 

792
01:01:32,281 --> 01:01:34,282
It is a new business, 
need to advertise. 

793
01:01:34,283 --> 01:01:36,075
It is helping 
the new business? 

794
01:01:40,044 --> 01:01:42,367
Honey, how did that happen? 
Pick up. 

795
01:01:42,368 --> 01:01:46,240
Hold on, Anne. I think we 
a saw-bones somewhere. 

796
01:01:47,228 --> 01:01:49,924
Easy. 
'll Get you there. 

797
01:01:51,198 --> 01:01:54,240
"You okay? 
"I'm going home. 

798
01:01:54,241 --> 01:01:56,175
-Now? 
-That was not cool. 

799
01:01:58,262 --> 01:02:01,364
Sorry. 
Go back? 

800
01:02:01,365 --> 01:02:03,036
Want me to call 
later? 

801
01:02:05,579 --> 01:02:07,079
What we do with you? 

802
01:02:07,891 --> 01:02:11,262
-Can I take you to the park. 
No, that's fine. 

803
01:02:11,263 --> 01:02:13,235
It is more complicated 
than you think. 

804
01:02:13,236 --> 01:02:15,548
I think I can take 
a child to the park. 

805
01:02:16,250 --> 01:02:19,442
-Good. Want to go? 
-I. 

806
01:02:22,116 --> 01:02:26,202
Go to the park. Only the park, right? 
Beware. Have fun! 

807
01:02:26,203 --> 01:02:27,703
Beware. 

808
01:02:28,455 --> 01:02:30,492
Only the park. 
Have fun. 

809
01:02:33,800 --> 01:02:36,415
I do not want a half-brother. 

810
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:39,500
Understood. 

811
01:02:41,800 --> 01:02:45,153
In your home, you have 
preferred a towel? 

812
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:47,500
Yes. 

813
01:02:50,300 --> 01:02:52,236
I can read 
upside down. 

814
01:02:57,742 --> 01:02:59,242
I have something for you. 

815
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:08,271
It is my own 
means of transport ... 

816
01:03:08,272 --> 01:03:09,976
Missions in the future. 

817
01:03:14,399 --> 01:03:16,088
What are you waiting for? 
Go play. 

818
01:03:16,089 --> 01:03:17,952
-I? 
Of course. 

819
01:03:25,493 --> 01:03:28,258
-I have a favorite towel. 
-Me neither. 

820
01:03:51,886 --> 01:03:54,650
-Kris, is not a good time. 
"My father died today. 

821
01:03:58,884 --> 01:04:01,527
"My father died today. 
My God. 

822
01:04:01,528 --> 01:04:03,449
Did not know where to go, 
Then I came here. 

823
01:04:03,450 --> 01:04:06,873
Is not the usual time, can 
give me more books if you want. 

824
01:04:06,874 --> 01:04:07,958
What? 
Nothing. 

825
01:04:07,959 --> 01:04:11,730
-Kris, is not a good time. 
-I am thirsty. 

826
01:04:12,862 --> 01:04:15,364
-Get something for him to drink. 
Of course. 

827
01:04:32,600 --> 01:04:34,100
Thank you. 

828
01:04:41,578 --> 01:04:42,799
So ... 

829
01:04:42,800 --> 01:04:44,674
I met him when I 
home. 

830
01:04:45,780 --> 01:04:48,425
Was sitting at the table 
doing crossword puzzles. 

831
01:04:49,500 --> 01:04:51,186
He never does 
crossword. 

832
01:04:51,187 --> 01:04:53,042
Kris has just come out 
rehabilitation. 

833
01:04:56,600 --> 01:04:58,100
You okay? 

834
01:04:59,578 --> 01:05:02,363
It is better not to talk. 
Let's be quiet here. 

835
01:05:06,540 --> 01:05:09,848
What did you mean 
with "the most books? 

836
01:05:09,849 --> 01:05:11,536
I have a 
small bookstore. 

837
01:05:11,537 --> 01:05:12,625
"Book Exchange". 

838
01:05:12,626 --> 01:05:15,260
-It was where I bought your book. 
-Perfect. 

839
01:05:15,261 --> 01:05:17,950
Arlen tried to sell books, 
but I could not pay. 

840
01:05:17,951 --> 01:05:21,937
He surtou. Now, I come here 
and return books by questions. 

841
01:05:21,938 --> 01:05:24,069
Does he pay with books 
the questions? 

842
01:05:24,070 --> 01:05:26,176
Fully-fair. 
No, it's horrible. 

843
01:05:26,177 --> 01:05:27,988
Still not heard 
questions. 

844
01:05:28,825 --> 01:05:31,832
Arlen, I can not feel anything. 
Nothing. 

845
01:05:31,833 --> 01:05:34,181
I should feel something, 
not? 

846
01:05:44,560 --> 01:05:47,909
Enjoys working 
in the bookstore? 

847
01:05:48,608 --> 01:05:50,108
I love the bookstore. 

848
01:05:51,022 --> 01:05:55,140
All those ideas by which 
bother to work hard. 

849
01:05:56,158 --> 01:05:57,779
Could never 
do something. 

850
01:05:58,660 --> 01:06:01,095
Rs Sometimes I'm in the middle of the store, 
night, 

851
01:06:01,096 --> 01:06:03,930
imagining that all authors 
esta r me. 

852
01:06:05,750 --> 01:06:08,703
I close my eyes and pretend that they are 
trying to tell me something. 

853
01:06:08,704 --> 01:06:11,114
They are. Are saying 
"Give me your money". 

854
01:06:16,300 --> 01:06:17,800
What else? 

855
01:06:18,800 --> 01:06:21,156
What else would you like 
in the bookstore? 

856
01:06:26,062 --> 01:06:28,667
I love that I feel 
safe, there. 

857
01:06:30,807 --> 01:06:33,497
Except-what? 
I do not know. 

858
01:06:34,100 --> 01:06:35,600
Know-yes. 
-No. 

859
01:06:37,650 --> 01:06:40,402
Let. Saved from what? 

860
01:06:42,800 --> 01:06:44,300
Except ... 

861
01:06:46,750 --> 01:06:48,986
To be afraid 
all the time. 

862
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:51,605
All the time. 

863
01:06:53,665 --> 01:06:55,753
I'm so tired. 

864
01:06:57,106 --> 01:06:58,765
It is so tiring 
be afraid. 

865
01:07:10,800 --> 01:07:12,300
My father died today. 

866
01:07:12,969 --> 01:07:14,469
I know, honey. 

867
01:07:16,600 --> 01:07:18,100
Sorry. 

868
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:30,149
-Okay? 
-Yes. 

869
01:07:30,150 --> 01:07:32,832
Come to the office 
that week. Free consultation. 

870
01:07:41,750 --> 01:07:44,548
I'm around. If you 
something may appear. 

871
01:07:45,300 --> 01:07:46,800
Let's see. 

872
01:07:49,469 --> 01:07:51,087
"You want to ... 
-I gotta go. 

873
01:07:57,316 --> 01:08:00,754
Why when you are with me 
says amazing things, 

874
01:08:00,755 --> 01:08:03,289
but when a boy 
loses his father and needs you, 

875
01:08:03,290 --> 01:08:05,623
says nothing. 
Why? 

876
01:08:06,900 --> 01:08:08,618
It's complicated. 

877
01:08:08,619 --> 01:08:12,951
Really? I thought it was easy 
for Arlen Faber. 

878
01:08:12,952 --> 01:08:14,914
Can you ... 

879
01:08:17,200 --> 01:08:19,755
What? What, Arlen? 
What are you hiding? 

880
01:08:24,200 --> 01:08:25,700
The time is up. 

881
01:08:28,400 --> 01:08:30,121
You can not do that. 

882
01:08:31,954 --> 01:08:34,873
I showed 
my monsters. 

883
01:08:39,289 --> 01:08:41,173
You really Arlen Faber? 

884
01:08:42,800 --> 01:08:46,189
I am not. 
And neither is Arlen Faber. 

885
01:09:28,200 --> 01:09:31,850
Anne, I'm calling again. 
Sorry, I said I would not mind. 

886
01:09:31,851 --> 01:09:35,865
I just want to apologize. 
Never again will use costumes. 

887
01:09:35,866 --> 01:09:37,000
Just a minute. 

888
01:09:37,001 --> 01:09:40,038
I promise, even 
on Halloween. If there is something ... 

889
01:09:46,350 --> 01:09:48,628
When I saw that he was, 
agreed to help me, 

890
01:09:48,629 --> 01:09:51,010
Since I do not tell 
anyone who he is. 

891
01:09:51,011 --> 01:09:53,866
Why he does not want 
anyone know? 

892
01:09:53,867 --> 01:09:55,949
I do not know. 

893
01:09:55,950 --> 01:09:59,562
Perhaps because he needs to have 
answers, but it is a disaster. 

894
01:10:03,850 --> 01:10:06,068
-It is his girlfriend? 
-No. 

895
01:10:08,092 --> 01:10:10,551
And that was before I talk 
he hiding? 

896
01:10:10,552 --> 01:10:12,052
No, but that did not help 

897
01:10:13,410 --> 01:10:14,910
You like it? 

898
01:10:17,012 --> 01:10:18,599
No matter. 

899
01:10:18,600 --> 01:10:20,100
That's it. 

900
01:10:23,514 --> 01:10:25,415
Step in the bookstore 
that week. 

901
01:10:26,150 --> 01:10:29,354
You better hurry up. 
I may be going out of business. 

902
01:10:32,940 --> 01:10:35,786
The first is free, 
then you should get. 

903
01:10:45,438 --> 01:10:47,484
MY HEART LISTENING TE 

904
01:10:49,011 --> 01:10:50,011
Hallo. 

905
01:10:50,012 --> 01:10:51,512
<i> Hi, is Elizabeth. 

906
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:56,199
Linking to apologize? 

907
01:10:56,200 --> 01:10:59,054
No. 
I need to ask a favor. 

908
01:10:59,055 --> 01:11:01,200
Rumor Has It 
does not help anyone ... 

909
01:11:02,645 --> 01:11:06,253
Anne is not here. 
I have a client, I am stuck. 

910
01:11:06,254 --> 01:11:08,014
I have not heard the favor. 

911
01:11:08,015 --> 01:11:12,012
I do not think I will ask this, 
but could pick up Alex at school 

912
01:11:12,013 --> 01:11:14,379
and take you to your house? 
I'll pick it up later. 

913
01:11:14,380 --> 01:11:16,533
And do not talk to anyone? 

914
01:11:16,534 --> 01:11:20,089
-No conversation. 
-E said it was my brother. 

915
01:11:20,901 --> 01:11:22,438
-You what? 
-I needed. 

916
01:11:22,439 --> 01:11:25,607
Please just go get it 
and bring it back. 

917
01:11:25,608 --> 01:11:27,325
<i> Just enter and exit. 

918
01:11:28,698 --> 01:11:31,494
Catch him and bring him back, 
without talking. Understood. 

919
01:11:36,350 --> 01:11:38,379
How are you, buddy? 

920
01:11:38,380 --> 01:11:40,738
His mother asked me 
to come pick you up. 

921
01:11:45,400 --> 01:11:46,900
Alexander came to pick up? 

922
01:11:47,975 --> 01:11:49,475
Yes, Alex. 

923
01:11:50,300 --> 01:11:51,923
-Must be his brother. 
-Right. 

924
01:11:51,924 --> 01:11:53,918
Expected to find it today. 

925
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:56,897
Today is a day of reunion. 

926
01:11:56,898 --> 01:12:00,500
She had a medical emergency, 
then I'll take Alex home. 

927
01:12:00,501 --> 01:12:03,063
I fear that this may affect 
the entry of Alexander 

928
01:12:03,064 --> 01:12:04,667
the advanced program. 

929
01:12:06,357 --> 01:12:07,873
You can talk to me. 

930
01:12:07,874 --> 01:12:09,839
After all, I am her brother. 

931
01:12:09,840 --> 01:12:11,427
Sure. Okay. 

932
01:12:11,428 --> 01:12:12,928
It will take just a minute. 

933
01:12:14,600 --> 01:12:16,100
Go ahead. 

934
01:12:18,872 --> 01:12:20,395
Crap. 

935
01:12:26,484 --> 01:12:27,984
Good. 

936
01:12:42,625 --> 01:12:44,358
I still 
do not know. 

937
01:12:46,017 --> 01:12:47,877
'm Zebulon. 

938
01:12:47,878 --> 01:12:49,680
Uncle Zebulon. 

939
01:12:54,650 --> 01:12:56,349
Alexander. 

940
01:12:56,350 --> 01:12:59,043
First, let me say 
is great to have him in the room. 

941
01:12:59,044 --> 01:13:02,518
He is very creative 
and friend to all. 

942
01:13:02,519 --> 01:13:06,095
If any of the other 
is hurt or upset, 

943
01:13:06,096 --> 01:13:08,477
it is always the first 
to console them. 

944
01:13:08,478 --> 01:13:11,416
He is very empathetic. 

945
01:13:11,417 --> 01:13:13,582
And empathy is 
a good thing. 

946
01:13:13,583 --> 01:13:16,017
-Good. 
"But in other areas ... 

947
01:13:16,018 --> 01:13:18,269
Empathy, reading, friends. 
Is more what? 

948
01:13:19,979 --> 01:13:21,234
Math. 

949
01:13:21,235 --> 01:13:24,633
Are well behind the others. 
Problems with sum, 

950
01:13:24,634 --> 01:13:28,032
while others have passed 
for multiplication. 

951
01:13:30,200 --> 01:13:34,018
You're the teacher, should not 
find a way to teach it? 

952
01:13:37,796 --> 01:13:39,551
I have 26students. 

953
01:13:39,552 --> 01:13:42,370
I can devote my time 
integer to a single student, 

954
01:13:42,371 --> 01:13:46,072
and Alexander must learn 
Our first lesson. 

955
01:13:48,379 --> 01:13:50,399
AM RESPONSIBLE 
Prestat AM 

956
01:13:50,400 --> 01:13:53,429
He is also ... 
How do I say that? 

957
01:13:56,900 --> 01:13:59,620
-Immature. 
-He is 7years. 

958
01:13:59,621 --> 01:14:03,771
Yes, but still makes jokes 
during the lessons. 

959
01:14:03,772 --> 01:14:07,169
And Rs also times when 
are trying to be quiet. 

960
01:14:07,170 --> 01:14:09,840
The other students must 
learn other lessons, 

961
01:14:09,841 --> 01:14:12,016
but Alexander makes it 
difficult. 

962
01:14:12,017 --> 01:14:15,686
"I think that Alexander ... 
-Let me interrupt. 

963
01:14:15,687 --> 01:14:17,362
I'll tell you 
some things. 

964
01:14:18,213 --> 01:14:20,834
All children develop 
different ways, 

965
01:14:20,835 --> 01:14:23,055
different times 
and different directions. 

966
01:14:23,056 --> 01:14:26,112
I'm sure Alex, 
at some point 

967
01:14:26,113 --> 01:14:30,610
is going to do 
and mature. 

968
01:14:30,611 --> 01:14:33,411
And we agree, 
I think that would be everything. 

969
01:14:34,650 --> 01:14:36,299
I think not 
listening. 

970
01:14:36,300 --> 01:14:39,075
What I'm hearing is 
that Alex is not a good candidate 

971
01:14:39,076 --> 01:14:41,206
to be a robot 
in his army of clones. 

972
01:14:42,580 --> 01:14:43,636
Zebulon! 

973
01:14:43,637 --> 01:14:45,519
Let's work the math. 
Right? 

974
01:14:45,520 --> 01:14:48,163
Meanwhile, why not try 
not make you feel 

975
01:14:48,164 --> 01:14:50,806
to be himself 
is a problem? 

976
01:14:50,807 --> 01:14:53,501
Was what happened between you and me. 
Been there? 

977
01:14:56,100 --> 01:15:00,243
By the way, his name is Alex. 
He hates Alexander. 

978
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:08,599
I'm in trouble? 

979
01:15:08,600 --> 01:15:10,856
I think the place 
instead. 

980
01:15:10,857 --> 01:15:12,450
She said it 
a great kid. 

981
01:15:12,451 --> 01:15:14,539
And should not make jokes 
when she speaks. 

982
01:15:14,540 --> 01:15:16,435
-All right. 
-By the way ... 

983
01:15:16,436 --> 01:15:21,451
If she asks, 
'm your Uncle Zebulon. Zebulon. 

984
01:15:21,452 --> 01:15:24,400
It is a hybrid name. 
It means "exalted". 

985
01:15:27,278 --> 01:15:29,199
What? 

986
01:15:29,200 --> 01:15:33,634
My mother says that it has 
poison and can make you sick. 

987
01:15:34,900 --> 01:15:39,809
And I say that if not 
the best sandwich you ever ate, 

988
01:15:39,810 --> 01:15:43,473
I change my name to Denise 
and I set the sea. 

989
01:16:21,350 --> 01:16:24,697
He is a good piano. 
-Yes, yes. 

990
01:16:26,343 --> 01:16:29,199
-Can play? 
-A little. 

991
01:16:29,200 --> 01:16:32,649
-Play something for me? 
-I prefer not. 

992
01:16:32,650 --> 01:16:34,150
Why? 

993
01:16:35,857 --> 01:16:41,126
He was my father and he died. 
And I remember him playing. 

994
01:16:41,900 --> 01:16:43,425
He was legal? 

995
01:16:44,750 --> 01:16:47,787
-Yes, he was. 
-Do you miss him? 

996
01:16:48,577 --> 01:16:50,896
Yes, very necessary. 

997
01:16:52,048 --> 01:16:53,548
Me too. 

998
01:16:56,104 --> 01:16:57,950
Can I ask a question? 

999
01:17:01,600 --> 01:17:03,405
How long 
2weeks? 

1000
01:17:09,185 --> 01:17:11,084
Okay. 
I do not know.

1001
01:17:23,340 --> 01:17:25,600
Hi, buddy. 
Wow, that It! 

1002
01:17:26,300 --> 01:17:28,950
Thank you for taking care of him. 
It will not happen again. 

1003
01:17:28,951 --> 01:17:30,374
No problem. 

1004
01:17:30,375 --> 01:17:32,299
-Bye, Arlen. 
-Bye. 

1005
01:17:32,300 --> 01:17:35,317
-Sorry for the levy. 
-We had fun. 

1006
01:17:36,700 --> 01:17:38,337
-Elizabeth. 
What? 

1007
01:17:40,683 --> 01:17:42,183
Nothing. 

1008
01:17:48,369 --> 01:17:51,201
Come here. Amused? 

1009
01:17:51,202 --> 01:17:53,374
Hamburgers <i>. 

1010
01:17:53,375 --> 01:17:55,789
Who thought <i> 
was a good idea? 

1011
01:18:31,524 --> 01:18:32,693
Kris, is there? 

1012
01:18:32,694 --> 01:18:34,194
<i> Go away. 

1013
01:18:53,834 --> 01:18:55,334
What's with the bottle? 

1014
01:18:56,901 --> 01:18:58,553
The funeral of my father 
was today. 

1015
01:19:00,300 --> 01:19:01,800
I was the one to go. 

1016
01:19:02,770 --> 01:19:06,546
I'm sure some 
not go. 

1017
01:19:09,380 --> 01:19:13,049
You said that the life of all 
moves to a purpose. 

1018
01:19:14,001 --> 01:19:16,190
Maybe my purpose 
is drinking. 

1019
01:19:18,800 --> 01:19:21,557
It was not what I meant. 

1020
01:19:23,201 --> 01:19:26,399
When I meet you, 
I thought I could help. 

1021
01:19:26,400 --> 01:19:28,739
You know what? 
Really helped. 

1022
01:19:28,740 --> 01:19:31,878
It helped me realize that all 
my worst fears are real. 

1023
01:19:31,879 --> 01:19:34,426
I mean, you can 
talk to the Man himself. 

1024
01:19:36,850 --> 01:19:38,679
And that was what he did 
for you. 

1025
01:19:42,807 --> 01:19:44,955
So perhaps it is better 
drink at once. 

1026
01:19:46,825 --> 01:19:48,828
Could this 
I meant. 

1027
01:19:50,557 --> 01:19:52,511
Congratulations, Arlen. 

1028
01:19:53,268 --> 01:19:55,232
You can have your 
life back. 

1029
01:19:56,500 --> 01:19:58,000
It was not what you wanted? 

1030
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:02,500
Get out! 

1031
01:20:35,852 --> 01:20:39,857
-Hi. 
-Hi, Arlen. Or rather, Zebulon. 

1032
01:20:40,857 --> 01:20:42,786
It means "exalted". 
Whether ... 

1033
01:20:44,048 --> 01:20:47,607
I do not believe I forgot 
the meeting. 

1034
01:20:47,608 --> 01:20:49,108
Lucky for you, 
I was there. 

1035
01:20:49,900 --> 01:20:51,400
What did it? 

1036
01:20:52,391 --> 01:20:53,891
Nothing. 

1037
01:20:54,600 --> 01:20:58,179
Children mature, friendship, 
reading, something about robots. 

1038
01:20:58,180 --> 01:21:00,565
Mrs. Gold called me 
and said 

1039
01:21:00,566 --> 01:21:03,750
Alex wants to recommend 
for the advanced program. 

1040
01:21:04,500 --> 01:21:09,826
-This is incredible! 
-Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. 

1041
01:21:10,500 --> 01:21:12,566
Just when I was 
give you up. 

1042
01:21:12,567 --> 01:21:16,140
-And what program is this? 
-Guidance learning. 

1043
01:21:16,141 --> 01:21:18,649
-Learning what? 
"How so? 

1044
01:21:18,650 --> 01:21:23,716
Ms. Gold seems 
through parent and school ... 

1045
01:21:23,717 --> 01:21:25,790
you love so much, 
is a big mistake. 

1046
01:21:25,791 --> 01:21:29,422
Keep my child far away 
the kind of person. 

1047
01:21:29,423 --> 01:21:31,967
What that child needs 
is self-confidence. 

1048
01:21:33,550 --> 01:21:36,870
When I went to thank 
for you attacking me? 

1049
01:21:36,871 --> 01:21:40,960
Sorry. Nothing. Glad 
who got what he wanted. 

1050
01:21:41,900 --> 01:21:44,286
Are you saying that Alex 
lacks self-confidence? 

1051
01:21:44,287 --> 01:21:48,200
It is still a child and 
This pressure will stop it. 

1052
01:21:48,201 --> 01:21:50,296
Or turn it 
a vendor. 

1053
01:21:51,281 --> 01:21:54,167
When you became 
expert in educating children? 

1054
01:21:54,168 --> 01:21:57,547
It's me who holds 
those trappings of death, 

1055
01:21:57,548 --> 01:22:00,926
purchase food and tells lies 
which is better than the truth. 

1056
01:22:02,890 --> 01:22:05,745
You try to turn it 
in whatever it is, 

1057
01:22:05,746 --> 01:22:07,691
instead of looking 
who he really is. 

1058
01:22:07,692 --> 01:22:09,999
-And that ... 
Who are you to judge? 

1059
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:14,015
Alex is everything to me 
and give the best for him. 

1060
01:22:14,016 --> 01:22:18,369
In doing so, it is good to 
that his father will not return. 

1061
01:22:22,544 --> 01:22:24,044
What did he? 

1062
01:22:27,300 --> 01:22:29,313
-What did he? 
Nothing. 

1063
01:22:29,314 --> 01:22:31,727
He asked 
how long it lasts 2weeks. 

1064
01:22:33,200 --> 01:22:34,928
Said nothing. 

1065
01:22:35,750 --> 01:22:38,894
He knows the truth, 
but need to hear from you. 

1066
01:22:40,500 --> 01:22:43,922
Let me guess. 
God said this to you. 

1067
01:22:43,923 --> 01:22:47,970
"They are having a hard time 
difficult, go there and help them. " 

1068
01:22:48,600 --> 01:22:51,600
No, of course not. 
Not want to help anyone. 

1069
01:22:51,601 --> 01:22:54,601
Not want to meet anyone. 
Want to stay here and watch. 

1070
01:22:54,602 --> 01:22:58,049
While others try 
find a way. It should be hilarious. 

1071
01:22:58,050 --> 01:22:59,778
Not it. 

1072
01:22:59,779 --> 01:23:03,870
I feel more alone now 
than before I met you. 

1073
01:23:14,165 --> 01:23:15,739
CLOSING THE DEAL 

1074
01:24:44,488 --> 01:24:45,988
Excuse me. 

1075
01:24:59,500 --> 01:25:01,053
You must be Kris. 

1076
01:25:03,398 --> 01:25:05,436
Terry Fraser 
agent Arlen. 

1077
01:25:07,150 --> 01:25:08,430
How did you get? 

1078
01:25:08,431 --> 01:25:10,764
Wait. I do not care. 
I do not care. 

1079
01:25:12,728 --> 01:25:14,360
What's going on? 

1080
01:25:14,361 --> 01:25:15,666
Do not you know? 

1081
01:25:15,667 --> 01:25:18,823
Arlen come here to talk about 
20a anniversary of the book. 

1082
01:25:18,824 --> 01:25:19,845
It's a miracle! 

1083
01:25:19,846 --> 01:25:22,200
He called me and told à night 
bring the books here. 

1084
01:25:22,201 --> 01:25:24,953
He said he had warned 
all websites. All! 

1085
01:25:26,250 --> 01:25:27,750
Come here! 

1086
01:25:29,700 --> 01:25:31,307
What's going on? 

1087
01:25:31,308 --> 01:25:34,010
The so-Terry came here 
with those boxes of books 

1088
01:25:34,011 --> 01:25:36,365
and said that his friend Arlen 
comes to speak here today. 

1089
01:25:36,366 --> 01:25:37,541
Let's get busy! 

1090
01:25:37,542 --> 01:25:39,548
We have no money 
to pay for it. 

1091
01:25:39,549 --> 01:25:41,454
Kris, was a gift. 

1092
01:25:45,415 --> 01:25:47,035
-Where is he? 
-You are welcome. 

1093
01:25:47,911 --> 01:25:49,926
No, Kris. 
Help me with this! 

1094
01:25:52,650 --> 01:25:54,150
Hello, everybody. 

1095
01:26:00,606 --> 01:26:02,633
<i> will accommodate you 
in a minute. 

1096
01:26:02,634 --> 01:26:04,299
Ready. 
Just fill it. 

1097
01:26:04,300 --> 01:26:06,000
We meet all 
I promise. 

1098
01:26:11,100 --> 01:26:12,722
What are you doing now? 

1099
01:26:12,723 --> 01:26:13,799
I'm kinda busy. 

1100
01:26:13,800 --> 01:26:15,543
Arlen will talk 
the bookstore. 

1101
01:26:20,300 --> 01:26:21,999
What <i> Arlen? 

1102
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:23,500
Arlen Faber. 

1103
01:26:31,750 --> 01:26:33,250
There he is! 

1104
01:26:40,370 --> 01:26:44,556
Ladies and gentlemen, this is 
a very special occasion. 

1105
01:26:44,557 --> 01:26:48,335
Something so we 
20years ago. 

1106
01:26:49,395 --> 01:26:51,396
The author of "Me and God". 

1107
01:26:51,397 --> 01:26:53,952
He showed us 
a glimpse of paradise. 

1108
01:26:54,805 --> 01:26:56,305
Arlen Faber. 

1109
01:27:04,600 --> 01:27:07,692
Thank you, Terry. Was right 
I should have done this before 

1110
01:27:09,040 --> 01:27:10,596
Thanks for coming. 

1111
01:27:12,300 --> 01:27:16,000
I would also like to thank 
Kris Lucas and the Distributor "Books Exchange" 

1112
01:27:16,001 --> 01:27:18,499
by allowing 
I use the shop. 

1113
01:27:18,500 --> 01:27:20,955
Is the best book store 
Philadelphia. 

1114
01:27:26,050 --> 01:27:29,105
Of the people who liked 
my book 

1115
01:27:29,106 --> 01:27:34,445
one person realized that he 
could help people. A. 

1116
01:27:34,446 --> 01:27:35,946
Terry Fraser. 

1117
01:27:37,348 --> 01:27:40,416
Terry was the only person 
which saw its value. 

1118
01:27:42,442 --> 01:27:45,956
I came here to say something to you. 
Hold the applause until the end. 

1119
01:27:48,300 --> 01:27:50,730
I know many of you 
Have you any questions. 

1120
01:28:00,700 --> 01:28:02,579
I can not talk to God. 

1121
01:28:12,200 --> 01:28:13,700
Here's the deal. 

1122
01:28:14,863 --> 01:28:18,768
For 20years, discovered 
my father had a disease. 

1123
01:28:19,513- --> 01:28:22,587
All he had 
and everything we did together, 

1124
01:28:22,588 --> 01:28:25,862
would be taken from him. 
One memory at a time. 

1125
01:28:26,713 --> 01:28:31,915
I received the news and I begged 
for help I do not know who. 

1126
01:28:34,094 --> 01:28:35,594
And nothing. 

1127
01:28:37,039 --> 01:28:40,684
I had questions, I 
responses. Needed them! 

1128
01:28:42,808 --> 01:28:44,308
You know how it is. 

1129
01:28:46,300 --> 01:28:47,800
Guess what happened. 

1130
01:28:49,200 --> 01:28:51,186
I could not get anything. 

1131
01:28:51,187 --> 01:28:53,062
And that irritated me 
pra caramba. 

1132
01:28:57,439 --> 01:28:59,228
So ... 

1133
01:28:59,229 --> 01:29:02,641
one day I got 
to write these questions. 

1134
01:29:03,850 --> 01:29:09,850
And answers to them came 
in my mind and well written. 

1135
01:29:11,518 --> 01:29:14,199
When I found myself, 
had a lot of pages. 

1136
01:29:14,200 --> 01:29:16,200
One thing led to another e. .. 

1137
01:29:18,733 --> 01:29:20,640
It was so 
"Me and God" was created. 

1138
01:29:24,109 --> 01:29:25,609
That's it. 

1139
01:29:27,629 --> 01:29:31,130
At that time, 
not given much importance. 

1140
01:29:33,613 --> 01:29:36,542
I would like it to be true 
more incredible than that. 

1141
01:29:36,543 --> 01:29:38,303
Mean 
was all made up? 

1142
01:29:41,650 --> 01:29:43,150
I do not know. 

1143
01:29:45,900 --> 01:29:47,687
Maybe. 

1144
01:29:47,688 --> 01:29:52,200
Maybe someone up there 
used my anger and pain 

1145
01:29:52,201 --> 01:29:55,076
to become part 
of some divine plan. 

1146
01:29:58,000 --> 01:30:01,136
And if there is some divine plan, 
'm certainly not included. 

1147
01:30:05,750 --> 01:30:07,444
I'm not the guy 
with answers. 

1148
01:30:19,548 --> 01:30:21,599
I'm just a guy ... 

1149
01:30:21,600 --> 01:30:25,080
Brought back 
civilization with all its might. 

1150
01:30:32,197 --> 01:30:34,304
Wait. 
And all those questions? 

1151
01:30:37,346 --> 01:30:40,499
Best advice I could give 
and I meant every word. 

1152
01:30:40,500 --> 01:30:42,043
Sorry. 
To go now. 

1153
01:30:42,044 --> 01:30:43,662
Then, 
is equal to all of us. 

1154
01:30:45,484 --> 01:30:47,037
Not yet 
but I'm trying. 

1155
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:55,602
To follow me! 

1156
01:30:57,000 --> 01:30:59,561
Can you wait a bit? 
This is ridiculous. 

1157
01:31:00,950 --> 01:31:02,452
You're right. It's ridiculous. 

1158
01:31:03,689 --> 01:31:06,485
You are complicated 
and confused. 

1159
01:31:07,818 --> 01:31:09,652
Alex and I do not need 
it. 

1160
01:31:09,653 --> 01:31:11,044
Need-yes. 
No! 

1161
01:31:11,045 --> 01:31:13,662
-You can go ... 
-And it was all a lie. 

1162
01:31:13,663 --> 01:31:16,200
-And I do not ... 
-Shut up, Elizabeth! 

1163
01:31:16,201 --> 01:31:20,313
All I said was true. 
It came from an invisible being. 

1164
01:31:20,314 --> 01:31:21,814
Came to me! 

1165
01:31:22,660 --> 01:31:24,160
Me. 

1166
01:31:26,300 --> 01:31:29,763
Shall I say it's 
fine for lying? 

1167
01:31:29,764 --> 01:31:33,113
I fall into your arms 
and say that is forgiven? 

1168
01:31:33,850 --> 01:31:35,495
I understand you. 

1169
01:31:37,081 --> 01:31:39,274
He was protecting himself, 
but lost control. 

1170
01:31:39,895 --> 01:31:41,695
Happens 
the best families. 

1171
01:31:42,700 --> 01:31:44,200
Let's leave it alone. 

1172
01:31:46,066 --> 01:31:47,566
It is not enough for me. 

1173
01:31:49,934 --> 01:31:54,712
Yes, I lied. Yes, sorry. 
Yes, I cheated. Yes to all. 

1174
01:31:56,850 --> 01:32:01,688
But you know, the answer 
all my questions ... 

1175
01:32:02,646 --> 01:32:05,425
It is a child like Alex, 
has a mother as you. 

1176
01:32:30,700 --> 01:32:32,874
If we could start ... 

1177
01:32:34,982 --> 01:32:37,121
maybe it ends 
a better way. 

1178
01:32:42,300 --> 01:32:43,800
Maybe. 

1179
01:32:53,747 --> 01:32:55,247
Elizabeth. 

1180
01:32:58,507 --> 01:33:00,007
Arlen.
