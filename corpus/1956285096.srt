Nice.

707
01:10:41,256 --> 01:10:42,857
It's from the 1100s.

708
01:10:42,859 --> 01:10:46,259
And now, in 1993,
we're gonna blow it up.

709
01:10:46,261 --> 01:10:48,197
Wait, blow it up?

710
01:10:50,700 --> 01:10:52,635
- You guys ready?
- Come on, let's go guys.

down seven churches.

I don't get it.

713
01:11:00,443 --> 01:11:04,447
You want to have the cathedral on the
cover, but you don't want to blow it up.

714
01:11:05,013 --> 01:11:06,681
It's just an album cover.

715
01:11:06,683 --> 01:11:09,750
No. It's not just
an album cover.

716
01:11:09,752 --> 01:11:11,853
You have Fantoft
on the cover of Aske.

717
01:11:11,855 --> 01:11:13,186
You even included matches.

718
01:11:13,188 --> 01:11:14,856
That was a call to action.

719
01:11:14,858 --> 01:11:18,759
Use the matches to burn down
a church like I did.

720
01:11:18,761 --> 01:11:21,496
- Come on, Kristian.
- My name is Varg.

01:11:24,701 --> 01:11:25,766
- We do?
- Yeah.

724
01:11:25,768 --> 01:11:28,169
In that case, let's get
some fucking dynamite...

725
01:11:28,171 --> 01:11:30,373
- You guys coming?
- ...and let's blow this up.

726
01:11:32,775 --> 01:11:33,941
Yeah.

727
01:11:33,943 --> 01:11:35,042
I will wait in there.

728
01:11:35,044 --> 01:11:36,177
You do what you want.

729
01:11:36,179 --> 01:11:37,512
I don't need your blessing.

730
01:11:37,514 --> 01:11:40,083

to do this together.

The fact that Norway
is ruled by a dictatorship,

734
01:11:47,090 --> 01:11:52,693
and our people are brainwashed with
empathy and solidarity by the church,

735
01:11:52,695 --> 01:11:56,097
and their stupid Christianity
doesn't bother you anymore?

736
01:11:56,099 --> 01:11:58,332
Of course it does.
I hate that shit.

737
01:11:58,334 --> 01:12:01,536
Either you do it for the cause
and you take action,

738
01:12:01,538 --> 01:12:04,372
or you do it because
you want attention

739
01:12:04,374 --> 01:12:07,110
and you want to be a
stupid-ass celebrity rock star.

740
01:12:08,278 --> 01:12:10,046
You can't have it both ways.

Hello?

751
01:13:51,850 --> 01:13:53,150
I'm going public.

752
01:13:54,251 --> 01:13:55,684
Public...
What are you talking about?

753
01:13:55,686 --> 01:13:57,020
I'm going to the press.

754
01:13:57,022 --> 01:13:59,421
We have to take this
to the next level.

our identity will be kept anonymous.

Wha... What's the point
of going to the press, then?

758
01:14:09,433 --> 01:14:12,602
We have to introduce them
to the Black Circle.

759
01:14:12,604 --> 01:14:16,271
They need to know what we've done
and that we intend to do more.

788
01:16:29,108 --> 01:16:32,178
you called me,
so what do you want?

789
01:16:34,613 --> 01:16:37,981
I know who's responsible
for the recent church burnings.

790
01:16:37,983 --> 01:16:39,950
And who would that be?

791
01:16:39,952 --> 01:16:41,752
It's... It's a group of people.

792
01:16:41,754 --> 01:16:44,421
Um, they call themselves
the Black Circle.

793
01:16:44,423 --> 01:16:47,260
- How many are you?
- Oh, there's six of us, and...

794
01:16:51,597 --> 01:16:57,768
So you and the so-called Black Circle,
you like to burn down churches.

795
01:16:57,770 --> 01:16:59,105
Why?

796
01:17:00,773 --> 01:17:02,209
Isn't it obvious?

797
01:17:06,378 --> 01:17:09,282
Do you know when the first
church was burned down?

798
01:17:10,850 --> 01:17:12,416
Uh, Fantoft?

799
01:17:12,418 --> 01:17:15,153
Uh, not exactly.

01:17:39,346 --> 01:17:40,444
Okay, so...

809
01:17:40,446 --> 01:17:41,545
And why do you do this?

810
01:17:41,547 --> 01:17:43,915
Is it a protest
against society or...

811
01:17:43,917 --> 01:17:45,750
Bring us back to our origins.

812
01:17:45,752 --> 01:17:47,087

814
01:17:51,091 --> 01:17:56,027
So you believe in paganism, and
you're a Satanist, and you're...

815
01:17:56,029 --> 01:17:57,529
You're also a Nazi.

816
01:17:59,099 --> 01:18:01,599
That's a pretty broad
belief system.

817
01:18:01,601 --> 01:18:04,936
Well, you know,
these things are all connected.

818
01:18:04,938 --> 01:18:08,373

and normal people to comprehend.

822
01:18:20,253 --> 01:18:22,787

in murder, too.

823

01:18:34,601 --> 01:18:35,702
That was you?

827
01:18:38,438 --> 01:18:39,773
Well, um...

828
01:18:40,274 --> 01:18:41,508
I can't say.

829
01:18:44,878 --> 01:18:45,946

834
01:18:59,492 --> 01:19:02,428
Anyone can put up some
black curtains, light candles,

835
01:19:02,430 --> 01:19:04,929
and look evil and scary,
you know, with a sword,

836
01:19:04,931 --> 01:19:08,700
but you haven't told me anything you couldn't
have seen on TV or read about in the papers.

837
01:19:08,702 --> 01:19:10,601
- Come on, let's go.
- Wait, wait.

838
01:19:10,603 --> 01:19:14,440
I know one thing that only the one
who burned down Fantoft could know.

839
01:19:14,442 --> 01:19:16,110
And what would that be?

840
01:19:18,279 --> 01:19:21,048
There was a dead rabbit
on the steps to the entrance.

841
01:19:24,352 --> 01:19:25,583
Okay.

842
01:19:25,585 --> 01:19:27,254
Okay. Let's continue.

843
01:19:29,090 --> 01:19:30,588
But I need some pictures.

844
01:19:30,590 --> 01:19:31,591
No.

845
01:19:32,492 --> 01:19:34,261
I can't reveal my identity.

846
01:19:35,595 --> 01:19:37,196
We can work around that.

847
01:19:37,198 --> 01:19:38,764
Yeah. There's no problem.

848
01:19:38,766 --> 01:19:39,932
No.

849
01:19:39,934 --> 01:19:41,767
Tell me everything you remember.

850
01:19:41,769 --> 01:19:44,203
- Okay.
- You know, just let your hair...

851
01:19:44,205 --> 01:19:46,772
- Hang?
- ...hang down to cover your face.

852
01:19:46,774 --> 01:19:47,775
Perfect.

853
01:19:49,276 --> 01:19:51,110

- Yeah.

- Yeah.

860

And maybe you can have that.

861
01:20:11,599 --> 01:20:13,265
- It looks very evil.
- Yeah.

862
01:20:13,267 --> 01:20:18,438
Maybe you can just look
with one eye, like an evil eye.

863
01:20:18,440 --> 01:20:20,941
- Yeah.
- You can't see my face, right?

Did your father
stop paying the rent?

880
01:21:12,928 --> 01:21:14,329
I'm gonna fucking kill him.

881
01:21:15,497 --> 01:21:16,764
You're gonna kill your father?

882
01:21:17,765 --> 01:21:20,599
- That's fucking sick.
- No, Varg.

883
01:21:20,601 --> 01:21:22,771
- I'm gonna kill Varg.
- Oh, okay.

884
01:21:24,605 --> 01:21:27,707
I'm going to use this
and paralyze that fucking idiot,

885
01:21:27,709 --> 01:21:31,478
drag him to the forest, tie him
to a tree, torture him to death,

886
01:21:31,480 --> 01:21:33,882
and make a fucking snuff film
out of the whole thing.

887
01:21:35,550 --> 01:21:36,551
For real?

888
01:21:37,686 --> 01:21:39,589
He fucked it up for all of us!

889
01:21:53,335 --> 01:21:54,801
We're closed.

890
01:21:54,803 --> 01:21:57,507
MAN: <i>Hello. I'm trying to reach
the guitarist from Mayhem.</i>

891
01:21:58,106 --> 01:21:59,573
Who's this?

892
01:21:59,575 --> 01:22:02,675
My name is Jason Arnold, I'm calling
from Kerrang! Magazine in London.

893
01:22:02,677 --> 01:22:06,112
"Kerrang! Magazine."
That's funny.

894
01:22:06,114 --> 01:22:09,215
Fuck you, Jan Axel.

895
01:22:09,217 --> 01:22:12,419
I'm trying to get a hold
of Euronymous, the, uh...

896
01:22:12,421 --> 01:22:14,423
The creator of true
Norwegian Black Metal.

897
01:22:17,326 --> 01:22:19,426
That would be me.

898
01:22:19,428 --> 01:22:21,861
It's only a matter of time
before Kristian...

899
01:22:21,863 --> 01:22:24,265
Uh, Varg...
I mean The Count,

900
01:22:24,267 --> 01:22:25,698
gets released from jail.

901
01:22:25,700 --> 01:22:27,368
I said it all along.

902
01:22:27,370 --> 01:22:31,104
I'm not saying he didn't do anything,
the police don't have shit on him.

903
01:22:31,106 --> 01:22:34,774
<i>With the Count locked up, who is
running the Black Circle for him?</i>

904
01:22:34,776 --> 01:22:37,613
I am. I've been the leader
from the beginning,

905
01:22:38,181 --> 01:22:39,812
with the Count.

906
01:22:39,814 --> 01:22:43,783
Write this... The Count and Euronymous
share leadership of the Black Circle,

907
01:22:43,785 --> 01:22:46,786
but I'm the creator
of true Norwegian Black Metal.

908
01:22:46,788 --> 01:22:48,922
So let's talk a little
about your band.

909
01:22:48,924 --> 01:22:50,857
What's going on with Mayhem?

910
01:22:50,859 --> 01:22:55,331
Uh, I'm releasing Mayhem's new
album, D <i>e Mysteriis Dom Sathanas.</i>

911
01:22:56,299 --> 01:22:58,698
D-E-M-Y.

912
01:22:58,700 --> 01:22:59,832
No.

913
01:22:59,834 --> 01:23:01,435
Yeah, "Y"...

914
01:23:01,437 --> 01:23:04,338
I mean, we... We had a little
setback when our singer, Dead,

915
01:23:04,340 --> 01:23:06,006
blew his brains out, but...

916
01:23:06,008 --> 01:23:09,709
<i>Lots of rumors about photos
of his dead body and necklaces</i>

917
01:23:09,711 --> 01:23:12,179
<i>made from parts of his skull</i>

918
01:23:12,181 --> 01:23:14,448
<i>and you eating
part of his brain.</i>

919
01:23:14,450 --> 01:23:17,518
We're not normal people.

920
01:23:17,520 --> 01:23:19,587
<i>We're not afraid
of a dead body.</i>

921
01:23:19,589 --> 01:23:22,256
It's not every day you get
the chance to see one...

922
01:23:22,258 --> 01:23:23,259
<i>Um...</i>

923
01:23:24,594 --> 01:23:25,595
Or taste it.

924
01:23:48,518 --> 01:23:49,852
<i>Hello?</i>

925
01:23:53,590 --> 01:23:54,591
<i>Hello?</i>

926
01:23:55,692 --> 01:23:56,991
<i>You still there?</i>

927
01:23:56,993 --> 01:23:58,660
Yeah.

928
01:23:58,662 --> 01:24:01,429
<i>So what's gonna happen now with
the Black Metal scene in Norway?</i>

929
01:24:01,431 --> 01:24:03,833
Only the man
with the horns knows.

930
01:24:05,034 --> 01:24:06,936
We're all his slaves
anyway, right?

931
01:24:11,107 --> 01:24:12,276
You there?

932
01:24:26,323 --> 01:24:27,591
OYSTEIN:
<i>Varg was right.</i>

933
01:24:28,258 --> 01:24:30,592
<i>The police had no evidence,</i>

934
01:24:30,594 --> 01:24:33,497
<i>so they had to release him,
and he was back on the streets.</i>

935
01:24:35,865 --> 01:24:40,934
<i>Norwegian Black Metal became infamous
after our feature in Kerrang! Magazine.</i>

936
01:24:40,936 --> 01:24:43,173
<i>Mayhem was once again
gaining momentum.</i>

937
01:24:44,207 --> 01:24:46,374
<i>I looked forward to seeing him.</i>

938
01:24:46,376 --> 01:24:48,376
<i>We had a lot to talk about.</i>

939
01:24:48,378 --> 01:24:49,946
Can you fucking believe it?

940
01:24:50,846 --> 01:24:52,015
Kerrang!

941
01:24:56,720 --> 01:24:58,253
It's weird.

942
01:24:58,255 --> 01:25:00,322
Your name is
all over the magazine.

943
01:25:00,324 --> 01:25:02,057
Says the guy on the cover.

944
01:25:02,059 --> 01:25:06,428
I'm on the cover because I talked to the
press, and now you're taking credit for that.

945
01:25:06,430 --> 01:25:08,096
You were against that, remember?

946
01:25:08,098 --> 01:25:09,331
Yeah, I was not against it.

947
01:25:09,333 --> 01:25:11,099
- I was just...
- Fuck.

948
01:25:11,101 --> 01:25:13,268
You always do that.

949
01:25:13,270 --> 01:25:15,172
You take credit for everything.

950
01:25:16,206 --> 01:25:18,609
You think you're the brains
behind it all?

951
01:25:19,876 --> 01:25:22,477
- What do you mean?
- We all took action, everyone except you.

952
01:25:22,479 --> 01:25:24,212
You did nothing.

953
01:25:24,214 --> 01:25:26,514
I'm the one hounded
by journalists.

954
01:25:26,516 --> 01:25:31,556
I'm the one who can't show my fucking
face without being recognized.

955
01:25:32,757 --> 01:25:33,924
It's worth it, isn't it?

956
01:25:35,292 --> 01:25:36,659
How's it feel?

957
01:25:36,661 --> 01:25:38,360
What the hell
are you talking about?

958
01:25:38,362 --> 01:25:40,095
Being a celebrity.

959
01:25:40,097 --> 01:25:41,865
You should enjoy
the fucking ride.

960
01:25:43,266 --> 01:25:45,936
I'm going to release
my music on my own label.

961
01:25:47,104 --> 01:25:48,771
What does that mean?

962
01:25:48,773 --> 01:25:50,273
I don't need you anymore.

963
01:25:54,846 --> 01:25:57,847
Okay. If that's what
you want, okay.

964
01:25:57,849 --> 01:26:01,550
You'll have to find another
idiot to steal everything from.

965
01:26:01,552 --> 01:26:03,051
I haven't stolen
anything from you.

966
01:26:03,053 --> 01:26:06,756
You're recording Mayhem's album
with money made from Burzum's sales,

967
01:26:06,758 --> 01:26:07,823
money that belongs to me.

968
01:26:07,825 --> 01:26:09,492
That money went straight
back to you.

969
01:26:09,494 --> 01:26:11,995
You're the bass player
of Mayhem now, remember?

970
01:26:14,532 --> 01:26:15,700
I quit.

971
01:26:18,870 --> 01:26:21,272
You only put me in the band
to get attention.

972
01:26:21,938 --> 01:26:23,608
The album's almost finished.

973
01:26:24,709 --> 01:26:27,543
It's gonna be big,
world tour, everything.

974
01:26:27,545 --> 01:26:30,646
Tour? I thought you were
true Norwegian Black Metal.

975
01:26:30,648 --> 01:26:33,284
- I fucking invented it.
- And now you betray it.

976
01:26:34,352 --> 01:26:36,051
You're a hypocrite.

977
01:26:36,053 --> 01:26:40,689
We should be making true Black
Metal music for a select few.

978
01:26:40,691 --> 01:26:43,426
Tours are for posers.

979
01:26:43,428 --> 01:26:45,494
"Never sell out,"
that's what you said.

980
01:26:45,496 --> 01:26:49,833
Saying things like
"never sell out" fucking sells.

981
01:26:49,835 --> 01:26:53,035
Come on.
I made all that shit up.

982
01:26:53,037 --> 01:26:54,703
Nobody gave a shit about us.

983
01:26:54,705 --> 01:26:58,775
I attracted people by saying,
"You can't have this..."

984
01:26:58,777 --> 01:27:01,110
"You're not worthy."
It's just promotion.

985
01:27:01,112 --> 01:27:02,547
No, no.

986
01:27:05,950 --> 01:27:07,118
Not for me.

987
01:27:08,787 --> 01:27:11,222
I believed in it,
and I still do.

988
01:27:13,424 --> 01:27:14,760
So do I.

989
01:27:16,929 --> 01:27:19,663
But it has to make sense.
It has to sell.

990
01:27:19,665 --> 01:27:22,099
Otherwise, what the fuck
are we doing here?

991
01:27:31,342 --> 01:27:34,345
You can keep that. That's
a piece of chicken bone.

992
01:27:37,449 --> 01:27:38,450
Chicken bone?

993
01:27:41,052 --> 01:27:42,955
Fake as everything else
with you.

994
01:27:50,762 --> 01:27:51,928
Fuck.

995
01:27:51,930 --> 01:27:54,431
FAUST: <i>Oystein says
he's gonna kill him.</i>

996
01:27:54,433 --> 01:27:56,793
Says he's going to paralyze him
with his taser or something.

997
01:27:58,035 --> 01:28:01,538
Says he's gonna
torture him to death,

998
01:28:01,540 --> 01:28:05,177
film the whole thing, make
a fucking snuff movie out of it.

999
01:28:13,118 --> 01:28:14,286
So how'd it go?

1000
01:28:15,287 --> 01:28:17,122
Uh, stay out of it.

1001
01:28:18,090 --> 01:28:20,092
Why do you care
about him so much?

1002
01:28:21,493 --> 01:28:22,694
I don't.

1003
01:28:23,195 --> 01:28:24,496
Yeah, you do.

1004
01:28:25,999 --> 01:28:29,034
I don't understand the strange
competition you have with this guy.

1005
01:28:30,869 --> 01:28:32,335
I mean, he acts like
he's the real deal,

1006
01:28:32,337 --> 01:28:33,940
but we all know
he's a fucking fake.

1007
01:28:34,874 --> 01:28:36,876
Yeah, that's what
he says about me.

1008
01:28:38,443 --> 01:28:42,047
Seriously, Oystein, stay the fuck
away from him and sort your shit out.

1009
01:28:49,022 --> 01:28:53,089
Look, you have
this dream, this vision.

1010
01:28:53,091 --> 01:28:56,092
You were in control.
You were a leader.

1011
01:28:56,094 --> 01:28:58,530
You could still be all of
those things if you wanted to.

1012
01:29:03,036 --> 01:29:04,436
Or are you just full of shit?

1013
01:29:10,944 --> 01:29:11,945
I just...

1014
01:29:15,048 --> 01:29:17,951
I mean, things have
been really, um...

1015
01:29:26,593 --> 01:29:27,760
I have to, um...

you fucking whore.

1031
01:30:54,347 --> 01:30:59,051
So, Faust said Oystein was going
to attack me with his taser gun,

1032
01:30:59,053 --> 01:31:00,118
and drag me into the forest?

1033

Yeah.

1034
01:31:01,454 --> 01:31:04,725
And then kill you and make a
snuff movie of the whole thing.

Of course not.
