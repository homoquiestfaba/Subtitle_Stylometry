00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:29,640
(BOOING)

3
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:31,360
(CHEERING)

4
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:33,880
Meh!

5
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:00,640
The day, August 17th.

6
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:03,680
The year, 1835.

7
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:06,840
The man, me. Ha!

8
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:09,760
Charles Darwin.
This morning, we set sail

9
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:12,840
for our next grand adventure,
the Galapagos.

10
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:18,000
And whatever extraordinary
creatures await me on these islands.

11
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:22,240
Huh? There's one now.
A blue-footed booby.

12
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:25,680
Ah-ha! Blue...

13
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:00,360
Booby.

14
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:08,960
Booby.

15
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:14,000
Booby.

16
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:23,040
(THEY GRUNT)

17
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:26,720
- Ah!
- Booby.

18
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:32,120
Ooh, er, Ed. This is embarrassing
but you have a little...

19
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:34,800
Um... Yeah, right there. You got it.

20
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:37,360
Op, I know. Give me a hand.

21
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,120
Booby.

22
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:48,080
- He's fine.
- OK, come on, brother.

23
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:50,120
The other flummels
are waiting for us.

24
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:52,560
So, we're late. What's the
worst thing that could happen?

25
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:08,720
Oh!

26
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:20,040
- Got it!
- (THEY CHEER)

27
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:23,160
- Got it!
- (THEY CHEER)

28
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:33,680
Listen up, flummels. The countdown
to the flower festival has begun.

29
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:36,040
So it's officially crunch time.

30
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:40,240
Ah! Hey, Mali. Here we are
almost right on time.

31
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:42,720
Now, I know we don't
have a lot of flowers but...

32
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:45,440
But the ones we've got
are different, dynamic and...

33
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:49,400
Weird. The flowers, you,
your brother, all weird.

34
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:51,440
That's why no-one wants you around.

35
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:54,720
Weird, weird, weird.
All of it weird.

36
00:03:56,680 --> 00:04:00,760
Well, Ed, we gave it a shot.
I thought they were nice.

37
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:03,560
It's fine.
I don't care what Mali thinks.

38
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:07,200
(LAUGHS) What are you talking about?
You care what everybody thinks.

39
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:11,080
Not right now because
I've got a big surprise for you.

40
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:15,800
Ooh! A hat thing.

41
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,840
It's not a hat thing.

42
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:20,840
It's an official headdress
for my new job.

43
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:23,160
When we all march up the mountain
for the flower festival,

44
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:25,920
I'll be in one of
the most important spots.

45
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:30,440
The very back because
I've been chosen to be

46
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:34,400
the friend at the end.

47
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:37,760
- But the back end.
- It's a start.

48
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,520
Mo, it's the opposite,
it's the finish.

49
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:43,160
- Still, it's an honour.
- How were you selected? - Randomly.

50
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:47,520
Well, I'm happy for you. You know
what would make it even better?

51
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:51,160
Op, I love you but this is my final
chance to make a good impression

52
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:54,120
with the rest of the flummels.
And don't take this the wrong way,

53
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:57,560
but please just try
not to ruin this for me.

54
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:02,160
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Well, whenever you help, things tend to...

55
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:04,520
- unravel. - (LAUGHS) Me?
- You. - Never.

56
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,560
- Always.
- Just give me one example.

57
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:10,920
Waterfall fail.
Mango avalanche. Rock in the hole.

58
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:13,000
The great fire. The greater fire.

59
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:16,600
Mud for dinner. Tree skis.
The burp-ening. Fish for hands.

60
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:21,280
The rain thing. Bee tornado. Bee
tornado two, the tropical swarm.

61
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:25,200
And, of course, Coconut Charlie
and the Jackfruit Jam Band.

62
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:27,720
- So we've had our ups and downs.
- Mainly downs.

63
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:30,600
But think of those
sweet, sweet occasional ups.

64
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:33,160
And besides, you need
to stop living in the past...

65
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:36,520
..and look to the future.

66
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:39,320
Hi, er, Op.

67
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:42,640
I just wanted to say,
I like that spinning you do.

68
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:46,560
Oh, thanks. I call it the Op Hop.
I can teach you if you want.

69
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:49,200
- You could?
- Sure. Just do what I do.

70
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:51,240
Huh!

71
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:56,720
(LAUGHS)

72
00:05:56,760 --> 00:06:01,200
- Oh!
- Bo, what have I told you about wandering off?

73
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:04,440
- Not to.
- Right.

74
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:07,080
Especially in this direction.

75
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:13,680
- Hm!
- Hm!

76
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:15,720
- (CHATTER / LAUGHTER)
- Are you working out?

77
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,520
- Did you change your fur?
- I combed it.

78
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:22,440
Holes front, everybody.

79
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:24,480
(MURMURING)

80
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:27,760
Get ready to give your
undivided attention

81
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:31,960
to the roundest guy around,
the king ring of our hoop troop,

82
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,760
- J-J-J-Jepson.
- (CHEERING)

83
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:38,920
Hey, thank you, Mali.
Thanks a bunch. Great stuff.

84
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:41,840
Hey, everybody. All right,
a little story just before we begin.

85
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:45,040
Last night, I was doing some
thinking, I was doing some math

86
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:51,080
and I realised, hey, hey,
this is the 100th flower festival.

87
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:54,760
Such a round number. Get it?

88
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:58,480
That guy gets it. I like that guy.

89
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:01,360
So, anywho, I decided
our theme this year,

90
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:05,400
just like very other year,
is flowers.

91
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:08,080
- Bloom!
- (CHEERING)

92
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:10,920
Ugh! Huh!

93
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:13,240
(WHISTLES)

94
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:16,880
- All right, cheer time is over.
- All right!

95
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:21,240
And, as always,
I and the Grand Flower Flummel

96
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:25,560
will lead us right to the top
of the mountain to celebrate.

97
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:29,240
And we'll all be there.
Old flummels and young flummels,

98
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:31,440
big flummels and small flummels,

99
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:34,360
flummels who love the beach
but especially he part

100
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:37,080
where the sand
is a little firmer... Ugh!

101
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:38,520
(THEY GASP)

102
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:41,920
Oh! I told you that
branch wouldn't hold us.

103
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:43,960
I don't remember you saying that.

104
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
I thought it.

105
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,800
(CLEARS THROAT)

106
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:51,720
Don't tell me, the weirdos.

107
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:01,520
Great! We've been
demoted to crab poking.

108
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:05,480
Well, hey, at least you still have
your job as the buddy in the back.

109
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:07,520
Friend at the end.

110
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:12,240
And with that headdress, you're
gonna be asked for a lot of dances.

111
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:16,120
I couldn't. I get nervous
talking to girls that aren't you.

112
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:18,600
I can't even talk to Vinnie
since he grew his hair long.

113
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:20,640
Sup?

114
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:23,880
Hey, what's...?
Looking good, looking good.

115
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:26,760
- (LAUGHTER)
- Oh! Hey, look, it's Wally.

116
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:29,120
- Hey, Wally.
- Wally? Really? Now?

117
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:31,880
- Hey, Wally!
- We have crabs to poke.

118
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:35,640
- (LAUGHS)
- Get over here, buddy. I wanna hear what's been happening.

119
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:39,440
Huh? Ho-ho! Hey, Op,
I'm coming, don't you worry.

120
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:43,960
We haven't talked since yesterday,
so there's a lot to catch up on.

121
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,120
Er, he's coming in pretty hot
towards the beach

122
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:49,880
- where all the flummels are working.
- Ah, you're right.

123
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:52,160
- Better shoo him off a bit.
- Let's be honest,

124
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:54,760
this all just is swimming.
You can't call it a school

125
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:57,000
and expect kids
to be excited about it.

126
00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:01,040
- That's the same thing.
- No, that was waving, this is a shooing motion.

127
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:03,960
No, it isn't.
This is a shooing motion.

128
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,640
- More like this.
- That's what I'm doing. - And we're done.

129
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,680
Great work, everybody.

130
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:11,720
And some great modelling, Kim.

131
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:15,480
- Oi!
- Guess what. Mr Seahorse is having a baby.

132
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:19,320
- This is a shooing motion.
- That's what I'm doing. - No. That's waving.

133
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:21,160
Drinking seawater makes you go crazy

134
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:24,080
- but, really, what else am I supposed to drink?-Waving.
- No, shooing.

135
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:27,280
- That's so waving.
- That's shooing. - Waving. - Shoo...

136
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:29,480
- Uh-oh!-Uh-oh!
- I know blubber is just what it's called

137
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:31,840
but that doesn't
make it any less hurtful.

138
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:37,800
- Oh! Oh! Save the Grand Flower,
flummels!-(EXCITED CHATTER)

139
00:09:57,840 --> 00:10:01,360
Random question.
Were you guys waving or shooing?

140
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:04,040
(GIGGLES)

141
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:06,080

(GRUNTS)

143
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,560
Hi. I can explain.

144
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:15,280
Oh, you two really did it this time.

145
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:18,320
You really did it.
Hey, where's your brother?

146
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:22,120
- Ah! Ah! Achoo!
- Whoa!

147
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:24,680
- ALL: Oh!
- Ugh!

148
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:27,760
I really hope
Jepson didn't see that.

149
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:29,800
Jepson!

150
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:34,200
(CLEARS THROAT)

151
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,480
You know, I'm patient.
Oh, yes, I am.

152
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:46,960
But sometimes a leader has to lead

153
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,720
and that is why, Op and Ed,

154
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:52,520
you are forbidden from
coming to the flower festival.

155
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:54,120
(GASPING)

156
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:57,480
While we go up the mountain,
why don't you two take some time

157
00:10:57,520 --> 00:11:01,320
and think about what
you did on Desolation Rock?

158
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:02,520
(THEY GASP)

159
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:10,760
Oh, that's why it's called that.

160
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:14,360
- Let's go, everybody.
- (MURMURING)

161
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:18,240
And there goes
my last chance to belong.

162
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,600
Listen, Ed, I...

163
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:24,760
- I know this seems bad but we can...
- Don't bother.

164
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:27,560
It's fine. I'm not mad, I'm just...

165
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,600
used to it.

166
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:35,160
(SIGHS)

167
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:42,600
Booby!

00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:44,640
Not now.

169
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:52,640
I've got an idea.

170
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:56,240
How do you talk me
into these things?

171
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:58,800
I finally understand
why this is called

172
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:01,640
the Forbidden-Don't-Go-Out-There-
It's-Way-Too-Dangerous Zone.

173
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:03,680
Look, we destroyed
all the flowers, right?

174
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:06,360
So we're gonna get more flowers
no-one's ever seen before.

175
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:08,440
And they'll have no choice
but to forgive us.

176
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:11,040
Now, come on, it's just
a little bit fur... Whoa!

177
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:13,080
Op! Oh, no!

178
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:15,640
I knew it. Now I'm scared,

179
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:18,880
stuck, alone and
a little overweight.

180
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:22,080
- What's wrong?
- Oh, you're alive! OK.

181
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:25,800
Ha! I was just making small talk.
Looks like rain. No, it doesn't.

182
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:29,040
- Look at this one. - Easy.
- Oh, and this one. - Easy does it.

183
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:32,040
- Whoa! I've never even seen this flower before.
- I've got this.

184
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:33,920
- Oh!
- That means I get to name it.

185
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:36,720
- No, I don't got this.
- Opodils. No, that's stupid.

186
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:40,760
- Operaniums. - Huh!
- Magnoliops. - These are really nice.

187
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:46,480
You know what?
This may actually work.

188
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:49,680
For sure, this is
totally going to... Whoa!

189
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:05,120
Don't even think about it.

190
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:09,680
- Just a little more, Ed.
- There is no more.

191
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:11,600
OK, OK. Forget it.
I think I can reach it.

192
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:13,640
This is my life.

193
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:20,720
What is that?

194
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:28,720
What is that?

195
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:31,520
Are you seeing what I'm seeing?

196
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:33,600
Yes, and it's amazing.

197
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:36,520
It is amazing.
What do you think it is?

198
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:39,200
No idea. I've never
seen anything like it.

199
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:41,160
Do you think it's
some kind of new whale?

200
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:44,720
- Whale? What are you talking about?
- What are you talking about?

201
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:49,200
- What are you talking about?
- Op, what are you talking about?

202
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:52,120
I'm talking about this
gorgeous, glowing, swirling....

203
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:54,640
Oh! OK. Not good.
Ed, help, pull me up.

204
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:56,480
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

205
00:13:56,520 --> 00:14:00,400
- Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
- I'm tired from poking crabs.

206
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:02,160
Booby!

207
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:11,160
Huh! Oh! (BLOWS)

208
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:15,840
- Oop!
- Yah!

209
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:17,640
Oh, boy!

210
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:19,200
- Argh!
- Argh!

211
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:26,160
(THEY SCREAM)

212
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:34,440
Oh! Argh!

213
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:37,160
- Oh!
- Help me!

214
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:38,800
Whoa!

215
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:41,840
(THEY YELL)

216
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:49,840
Oh! Oh, wow!

217
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:54,120
- Wow! That's a... Wow! OK.
- Ed, Ed, relax.

218
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:57,320
- Think about it.-Uh-huh!
- We went into a flower on Flummel Island,

219
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:59,760
- then we came out of a flower in this place.
- Mm-hm!

220
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:01,800
Do you know what that means?

221
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:05,320
Yes, yes! No, I don't. Do you?

222
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:09,080
No, but it's still
pretty wild, though.

223
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:11,160
(ROARING)

224
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:13,200
Oh!

225
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:18,560
(HUMS)

226
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:23,400
- Wait here.
- Oh!

227
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:35,280
- Whoa!
- (WHIRRING)

228
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:38,280
Hmm! Something's stuck.

229
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:48,280
Hmm! Where are my
mid-distance bifocals?

230
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:53,160
Whoa. Oh, oh, oh.

231
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:58,280
Oh! Ah! Oh!

232
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:00,320
- Oh!
- Nice reflexes.

233
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:07,640
(YAWNS)

234
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:11,320
- Aww, cute.
- Aww, cute.

235
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:12,720
(SNEEZES)

236
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:15,320
- Aww, really cute.
- Aww, really cute.

237
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:18,000
(BARKS)

238
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:20,080
- Ah! Less cute.
- Ah! Less cute.

239
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:24,960
Oops!

240
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:31,520
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
Wait a minute. Stop.

241
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:33,560
What is happening?

242
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:37,120
How did flower picking
turn into whatever this is?

243
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:39,480
Don't worry. I can fix this.

244
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:41,520
Yeah? Fix that.

245
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:46,040
Fix it?

246
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:48,960
It's amazing.

247
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:52,320
Amazing? Where are you going?

248
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:54,120
Hmm!

249
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:56,320
Ah!

250
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:00,440
Ooh!

251
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:04,400
Op, that mount you're on
is moving.

252
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:06,120
Whoa.

253
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:07,840
Ed?

254
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:15,520
- Oh!
- Oh, er, Op, Op!

255
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:17,640
Ugh! Ugh! Ugh!

256
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:19,680
Whoa! Oh!

257
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,640
(LAUGHS)

258
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:25,000
Oh! Ugh!

259
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:27,760
Ugh! Ow! Oh!

260
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:32,240
Whoa! Op! Op! Op! Op!

261
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:34,280
Whoa! Ugh! Argh!

262
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:37,880
Ugh! Oh! Oh! Ohhh!

263
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:42,600
Op! Ow! Ow!

264
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:56,520
Seems about right.

265
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:59,000
Thanks for the lift.

266
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:02,280
Oh, hey. Isn't this place great?

267
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:05,160
We should have never
left Desolation Rock.

268
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:08,160
Come on.

269
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:11,720
Your ideas have caused us
nothing but trouble,

270
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:15,480
so we're doing things my way,
the Ed way.

271
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:17,560
Ooh!

272
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:19,880
What are you?

273
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:22,400
You're the cutest things
I've ever seen.

274
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:24,680
Do you wanna come
home and marry my dolly?

275
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:26,720
And you can marry my cat.

276
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:30,360
Why do you get the cat?
I want the cat.

277
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:32,640
- (HUMS)
- (BARKS)

278
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:35,280
(SCREAMS)

279
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:36,880
- It's you again.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

280
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:39,840
You got it all wrong.
I'm here to help you guys.

281
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:41,960
Sorry for being
so rude back at the house.

282
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,440
We dogs are very territorial,
you know.

283
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:46,760
- No. We don't know.
- We don't know anything.

284
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:48,720
Oh, well, let's start
with the basics then.

285
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:52,000
I'm Clarance and I'm a dog.
Ruff, ruff!

286
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:55,200
Well, hi, Clarance.
I'm Op and this is Ed and we are...

287
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:57,240
Oh, flummels.

288
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:00,320
We'll save you.

289
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:08,080
Er, guys? Wait, wait.
No, no, you don't understand. No.

290
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:09,840
Let me show you.

291
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:13,480
- (WHINES / BARKS)
- Oh, cute little doggy.

292
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:18,120
- Here you go.
- Argh! He's gonna eat a flummel.

293
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:22,640
You monster. We won't let you die,
brother. I'm not getting a pulse.

294
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:26,120
- Argh!
- (SCREAMS)

295
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:27,760
(THEY SCREAM)

296
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:29,640
Guys, guys, guys,
it's just a doughnut.

297
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:33,120
Food, refined sugar, trans fats.

298
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,360
I have to admit,
we're pretty delicious.

299
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:41,960
Mmm!

300
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:46,400
Um, right. Yeah. I imagine
you guys have a few questions.

301
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:49,520
- (MUNCHES)
- Yeah. Like, where are we?

302
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:53,600
You should probably ask,
"When are we?"

303
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:58,280
- No. We're gonna stick with where are we.
- Yeah. Where?

304
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:00,400
Seriously,
you should ask when. Seriously.

305
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:04,160
- No, where.
- Yeah, I'm good with where.

306
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:06,480
Er, this will take some visual aid.

307
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:09,680
Oh, I know just the place
to get you some answers. Follow me.

308
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:13,640
Yeah. This way.

309
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:23,400
Oh! Ed, stop.
I don't know what these are

310
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:26,360
but I finally feel like
we belong to something.

311
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:29,680
(SIGHS)

312
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:34,600
(GASPS) Whoa!

313
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:43,640
This place is kind of spooky.
Ugh! It makes my skin crawl.

314
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:45,840
No offence. (GASPS)

315
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:47,640
No! Stay with the group.

316
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:50,440
- Us's.
- Ah! What are we looking at here?

317
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:53,280
- We found us's. Flummels.
- Oh!

318
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:01,960
And, as usual, they're ignoring us.

319
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,880
Hey. It's Charlie. What's up?

320
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:07,400
Oh.

321
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:09,440
Oh! Ooh! Oh!

322
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:11,480
Oh!

323
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:16,680
- So, what's going on here?
- Guys, guys, relax. (LAUGHS)

324
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:18,560
They're just models. Fakes.

325
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:23,560
This is
the Hall of Extinct Creatures.

326
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:27,480
OK. I mean,
the Hall of Extinct Creatures.

327
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:30,000
What does extinct mean?

328
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:32,400
I have no idea. I just joined.

329
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:35,160
Well, you see it began with...
I guess I could...

330
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:37,200
Oh, you know what?
I'll just let this thing do it.

331
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:42,400
Flummels, The Whole Story.

332
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:46,880
A ship cuts across the sea
toward destinies unknown.

333
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:49,360
That's the thing I saw
before we fell into the flower.

334
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:52,600
We are the Beagle
of His Majesty's royal fleet.

335
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:57,360
That's Charles Darwin, author of
On the Origin of Species.

336
00:21:57,400 --> 00:22:00,760
Well, not yet. Right now,
I'm studying the Galapagos

337
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:03,720
where I've just discovered
a previously unknown island.

338
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:05,360
- Home.
- Home.

339
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:09,720
Unfortunately, the island volcano
erupted before they got there.

340
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:15,160
- No home?-No home?
- All that was left was a single sliver of beach.

341
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:17,720
That's not even
the best part of the beach.

342
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:19,760
On the island, Darwin discovered

343
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:22,600
the remains of an unusual
ring-shaped animal

344
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:25,720
he called Flummelios hidella

345
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:28,160
or flummels.

346
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:31,240
He theorised that
the entire flummel species

347
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:33,360
was destroyed by the volcano.

348
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:36,080
- Flummelios hidella was no more.
- (THEY SCREAM)

349
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:39,880
Dead. Gone. Finished. Extinct.

350
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:43,360
Extinct? Do you mean...?

351
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:45,280
Oh! Ugh!

352
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:49,360
Wait. All the flummels gone?

353
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:51,880
How did this happen?
It doesn't make any sense.

354
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:54,600
Everyone was just fine.
We were just there.

355
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:58,440
Unless we weren't just there.

356
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:01,080
- OK, Clarance, I'll ask.
- What?

357
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:14,240
When are we?

358
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:19,440
So, we're in the future
in a place called Shanghai

359
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:22,240
and all of the other
flummels are gone?

360
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:24,880
- No more Jepson?
- No more little Bo.

361
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:27,200
No more that guy
whose name we don't know.

362
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:29,920
Normally, I'd be excited
that we just rhymed.

363
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:34,360
Don't worry. Well, worry a little,
but either way, stick with the dog.

364
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:39,880
Oh! That's Sun,
Dr Chung's wife. Nice lady.

365
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:42,160
Really knows how to scratch a tummy.

366
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:45,800
Dr Chung discovered these flowers
and used them to travel through time

367
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:49,440
before he got lost
somehow, somewhere.

368
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:52,760
Anyway, the answer to all your
problems is right through here.

369
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:55,160
- So, come on.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

370
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:58,400
I'm not going through that thing
again. What if we end up Dr Chunged?

371
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:00,960
Hey, you're in good hands.

372
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,600
OK. Paws, but front paws, get it?

373
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:06,800
Thanks to me, Sun hasn't even
noticed that Dr Chung is missing.

374
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:11,960
- Huh! I'm convinced. Let's go.
- Whoa!

375
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:16,680
BOTH: Whoa!

376
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:20,200
- Ugh!
- Ohhh!

377
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:22,160
- (THEY GROAN)
- Huh?

378
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:28,120
Welcome to the time terminal,

379
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:30,320
terminal, terminal,
terminal, terminal.

380
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:33,200
A place neither
in the past nor the future.

381
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:36,040
Dr Chung discovered that
each one of these portals

382
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:39,080
leads to a different
time flower somewhere in history.

383
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:41,520
Allow me to demonstrate.

384
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:44,880
Let's try this one. Austria, 1787.

385
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:53,120
- (PIANO PLAYS)
- That's Mozart. The musical genius.

386
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:56,280
Now, check this out.

387
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:00,240
- Was ist das?
- (GUITAR PLAYS)

388
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:03,560
And now he's just showing off.

389
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:09,640
All we have to do is find the seed
that activates the Galapagos portal

390
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:11,800
- and you'll be on your way home.
- Home?

391
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:13,720
To a volcanic explosion?

392
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:18,440
No, home before the volcanic
explosion, so we can warn everyone.

393
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:22,040
Warn them? How are the flummels
gonna trust us with their lives

394
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:24,840
when they don't even
trust us with their flowers?

395
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:27,840
Remember when I told you
to look to the future?

396
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:31,280
This is that future
because we're the only ones

397
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:33,800
who can save the flummels
from extinction.

398
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:38,440
So, forget fitting in.
We're gonna stand out as heroes.

399
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:40,880
OK. OK.

400
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:43,400
But if we're gonna do this,
we have to do it right.

401
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:45,680
Let's concentrate. Take our time,

402
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:48,200
carefully consider our every move.

403
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:52,040
- Absolutely. It's all about focus.
- Ugh!

404
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,840
Totally not this one.

405
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:59,000
- Not this one or this one.
- Oh! Ah!

406
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:00,720
Ugh! Ah! Ugh!

407
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:03,840
- You're doing it all wrong.
- No, actually, I'm doing it all right.

408
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:05,840
Gallipoli. Galilee.

409
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:08,720
- No. - You're in the wrong.
- Oh, here it is, Galapagos 1835.

410
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:11,000
Listen, I'm...

411
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:13,040
Well, dang.

412
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:17,120
I found it. I found the seed for it.

413
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:21,160
Maybe we're supposed to be extinct.

414
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:23,200
Not good. Not good.

415
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:30,400
Oh!

416
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:44,280
Aarrgghh!

417
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:46,560
Aaarrrggghhh!

418
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:48,080
Ugh!

419
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:51,000
Huh! Where am I?

420
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:53,640
This is horrible.
I've got to get out of here. Oh!

421
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:56,240
And who are you?
I'm Ernest Shackleton,

422
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:58,800
head of the
Ernest Shackleton Expedition.

423
00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:01,960
Now, don't worry, you're
with friends, part of a team,

424
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:06,720
team Ernest Shackleton, named after
me, Ernest Shackleton. Good dog.

425
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:08,760
Ernest Shackleton.

426
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:12,000
Hello. I'm Clarance. And you are?

427
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:14,600
ALL: We are only here
to serve Master.

428
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:19,120
OK. Maybe we'll do names later.

429
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:26,640
- BOTH: Whoa! - Wah! Intruders!
- Sanitise them.

430
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:29,160
- Argh! - Oh!
- What are you two?

431
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:31,840
Monsters? Space aliens? (GASPS)

432
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:35,560
- Elvis! Are you two Elvis?
- We're none of those things.

433
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:39,200
We're Op and Ed, we're... They
appear to be a pair of flummels,

434
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:42,360
Flummelios hidella to be exact.
The Germans refer to them as

435
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:46,800
(SPEAKS GERMAN) They all went
extinct in the early 19th century.

436
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:49,400
My name is Dottie. I'm a dodo bird.

437
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:52,320
My anxious friend here is Burnie,
he's a Tasmanian tiger.

438
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:54,600
And Alma is a meridian gelada.

439
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:56,080
Meriged...?

440
00:27:56,120 --> 00:27:57,760
Just Alma. It's fine.

441
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:09,040
Who are these guys? They're new
and small and new. New guys.

442
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:11,600
And this is Hoss.
He's from the Cretaceous period,

443
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:15,080
so he's millions of years old
but also he's only five.

444
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:18,680
- Are these new extinctables?
- What are extinctables?

445
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:21,760
- We are, mate.
- We'd be happy to tell you all about everything.

446
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:26,520
We have a nice glossy brochure

- Brochure. - Song it is.

You know, I feel Clarance would've
really gotten a kick out of that.

Wait? Clarance, Clarance?
Clarance, Clarance, Clarance?

489
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:31,400
What did you do?

490
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:36,440
It all happened so fast.
Er, the portals just went crazy

491
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:40,920
and then Clarance flew away,
like dogs do.

492
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:44,480
This is a new record, Op.
We've been here all of ten minutes

- and everybody already hates us.
- Oh, hate is a strong word.

It's fine. It'll all be fine.

00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:01,320
I hate to break it to you
but there's no telling where

498
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:04,800
- or when Clarance might be.
- Not to mention, he may be taken by

499
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:07,880
body snatchers,
boogeymen, Cyclopses.

500
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:11,440
Burnie. The point is, Clarance
could be anywhere literally.

501
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:15,360
Well, not anywhere. Doesn't he
have to be in one of those places?

502
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:20,680
Let me get this straight. You're
suggesting you randomly journey

503
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:22,880
to these dozens of unknown
and dangerous places

504
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:25,840
in hopes of stumbling across
Clarance by sheer dumb luck?

505
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:28,680
Sounds like a plan to me.
Let's go find that dog.

506
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:32,200
Wait. Did she say dangerous?
Did you say dangerous?

507
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:34,840
Dangerous is just
another word for heroic.

508
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:37,760
Well, they're dead.

509
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:40,160
Oh!

510
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:45,480
- Huh?
- Hello, sir. Have you seen a cute little doggy around here?

511
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:48,040
- Really fluffy, about yay high.
- Ugh!

512
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:49,960
- Oh!
- Oh! Ugh!

513
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,000
Ugh!

514
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,440
- Argh!
- No!

515
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:58,040
Argh! Ohhh!

516
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:01,880
Okey-doke. We're done here.

517
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:12,560
- Crikey! You're not dead.
- Pay up.

518
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:16,760
No sign of Clarance
and we almost got killed.

519
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:18,800
This is why I don't like to travel.

520
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:21,200
Come on, Ed. We've got
a lot more places to check,

521
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:23,520
- so let's not get distracted.
- Oh!

522
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:25,880
- My face.
- Ugh!

523
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:30,480
Hey. Oh, look it's me. Hi, me.

524
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:32,920
Oh, no. There's a hole
right through me. (LAUGHS)

525
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:34,840
Just messing.
I know that's how I look.

526
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:37,080
Wow! Your sister really is...

527
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:38,880
Bound to be
the eventual death of me?

528
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:40,880
I was going to say energetic.

529
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:43,720
OK, Ed? I've got a great
feeling about this next portal.

530
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:45,800
- Do you trust me?
- No.

531
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:46,160
Huh! Ssh.

532
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:51,040
Ah-ha.

533
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:05,080
Oh!

534
00:34:09,240 --> 00:34:13,960
- Ha! That lady really didn't like us trying on her hat.
- You think?

535
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:18,360
Wow! Cleopatra's crown. History
must be a non-stop adventure.

536
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:20,560
What's it like out there?

537
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:23,680
It's amazing. Each place
is more exciting than the last.

538
00:34:23,720 --> 00:34:26,880
- And more dangerous.
- Listen to this one, Hoss.

539
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:31,640
As I've told you before, you do not
want to leave here where it's safe.

540
00:34:31,680 --> 00:34:34,400
And, Op, he's just a kid.

541
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:37,320
You should stop putting
ideas in his head.

542
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:41,840
But I want ideas in my head.
I'm so cooped up in here.

543
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:44,120
I know what will knock
the glum right out of ya.

544
00:34:44,160 --> 00:34:48,320
Live from inside Dr Chung's
mobile greenhouse,

545
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:52,400
it's Burnie, the Down-Under-Wonder.

546
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:55,200
- (THEY CHEER) Yeah.
- We got great seats.

547
00:34:55,240 --> 00:34:59,040
First, I'll need
a common household item.

548
00:35:00,120 --> 00:35:04,120
Now, I place the object
between the two time flowers

549
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:09,120
and utter the magic words,
presto-change-o-koala-dingo.

550
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:12,840
Ooh! Where'd it go? Where'd it go?

551
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:15,840
Easy, jumbo.
It'll be back in three,

552
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:18,520
- two, one, and...
- Oh!

553
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:23,800
- How did you do that?
- A magician never reveals his secrets.

554
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:27,240
The merging of two time flowers
causes an extremely powerful arc

555
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:30,440
that disassembles the atoms of an
item, sends them into a time loop,

556
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:32,920
then reassembles the item
at a different point in time.

557
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:34,960

Well, I think I heard Master say

566
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:05,880
you two should snap my leash
so I can go free.

567
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:08,960
BOTH: As Master wishes.

Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

But I do see a pretty good wall.

Um, no, I'm not.
We have a lot of mess ahead of us

582
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:09,520
and you keep making the mess
messier. You are a mess-maker.

Ugh. What's wrong with me?

There's nothing wrong with you.
You just don't think things through.

but, one of these days,

you're gonna get someone hurt,

You're right
but I'm gonna be better.

From now on, we don't do anything
unless we're both on board.

- (KEYS CLANG) - Was ist das?
- (GROWLING) - Nein. Nein.

672
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:36,240
Oh, oh! Oh!

673
00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:41,640
OK. We got Clarance.
We got the seed. We...

674
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:43,400
Oh, no.

675
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:46,360
- Are you OK, Hoss?
- No, he's not OK.

676
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:49,760
You almost got him extinct.
Not to mention the rest of us.

677
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:53,040
- But I didn't think...
- That's right. You didn't think

678
00:42:53,080 --> 00:42:57,000
and you didn't listen,
even though you looked me in the eye

679
00:42:57,040 --> 00:42:59,320
and promised me that
you wouldn't do anything

680
00:42:59,360 --> 00:43:01,840
unless we were both on board.

681
00:43:03,360 --> 00:43:05,840
All this time, I thought
I never fit in with the flummels

682
00:43:05,880 --> 00:43:07,880
because there was
something wrong with me.

683
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:09,920
But now it's clear,

684
00:43:09,960 --> 00:43:11,960
it's you.

685
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,560
What...? What are you saying?

686
00:43:14,600 --> 00:43:17,880
I'm saying that my life
would be better off without you.

687
00:43:25,640 --> 00:43:27,640
(WHIMPERS)

688
00:43:30,920 --> 00:43:33,520
Hey. Hey, he'll be OK.

689
00:43:33,560 --> 00:43:35,960
I'm sure he just needs
some time to cool off.

690
00:43:38,120 --> 00:43:40,520
- What are you doing?
- Ed's right.

691
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:42,560
I am the problem.

692
00:43:42,600 --> 00:43:44,720
And he is better off without me.

693
00:43:44,760 --> 00:43:46,760
All of you are.

694
00:43:47,960 --> 00:43:49,720
But there's one thing
I can still do.

695
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:52,000
I'm going back to warn the flummels.

696
00:43:52,040 --> 00:43:54,960
Whoa, whoa, whoa. I'm not
sure you should go without Ed.

697
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:56,960
I just end up
causing him more trouble

698
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:59,400
and I've caused him
enough trouble already.

699
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:02,880
If I can pull this off, then Ed
will have a community to go home to.

700
00:44:02,920 --> 00:44:08,720
And, if I fail, well,
at least I can't hurt him again.

701
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,040
The seed, if you please.

702
00:44:23,480 --> 00:44:25,480
Ugh! Ugh!

703
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:27,880
Ugh! Come on. Ugh!

704
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:30,200
Hmm! This is not good.

You know, you're also a great leader
on the dance floor. (LAUGHS)

708
00:44:43,160 --> 00:44:46,280
Thanks, Mali. You've said
that about five times already.

709
00:44:47,320 --> 00:44:49,480
What is she doing here?

Hello-ah!

00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:55,720
Little reminder.
This is the flower festival.

712
00:44:55,760 --> 00:45:00,080
Second reminder, you've been
banned from the flower festival.

the whole story but I need

to get my kids to sleep in here.

- (CRYING)
- Oh, now I'm up all night. Thanks.

717
00:45:18,680 --> 00:45:23,320
I just returned from the future
and I learned that in the past,

718
00:45:23,360 --> 00:45:26,560
and by the past I mean now,
our entire species

719

is about to stop existing.

720
00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:31,080
So, if we're going to
live to see the future,

721
00:45:31,120 --> 00:45:34,880
we have to do something now,
which is in the past.

No.

Easy. Easy. It's all right.
Everyone, I promise you.

Op, you're being ridiculous.

That's why I made this face
because you're ridiculous.

- Argh!

on your bad side. (SNIGGERS)

But don't you think you were
maybe a little bit hard on her?

745
00:46:51,240 --> 00:46:54,200
She is your sister after all.

746
00:46:54,240 --> 00:46:58,160
No. It's been
like this our whole lives.

747
00:46:58,200 --> 00:47:00,800
Maybe I shouldn't
have said it out loud.

00:47:00,840 --> 00:47:03,040
But it's true.

749
00:47:03,080 --> 00:47:06,680
My life would be
much better without her.

750
00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:09,280
Oh, Ed, don't say that.

This is a place of withouts.

752

We all live here
without our families,

753
00:47:17,240 --> 00:47:19,920
without friends.

754
00:47:19,960 --> 00:47:23,600
Sometimes, I think
without really living at all.

755
00:47:23,640 --> 00:47:25,880
But I can tell you this,

756
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:28,640
life is really tough
when you're all by yourself.

00:47:31,240 --> 00:47:33,000

a hand with this? Anyone?

00:48:21,920 --> 00:48:24,160
I have to talk to Op.

Hey, Ed, check this out?

00:48:30,600 --> 00:48:32,600
You wanna sign my cast?

776
00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:34,480
I wanted to ask
Op if she'd sign it too

777
00:48:34,520 --> 00:48:36,400
but she left in kind of a hurry.

778
00:48:36,440 --> 00:48:38,840
She left? Left where?

779
00:48:38,880 --> 00:48:42,440
I think she said
something about going home.

780
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:45,760
Going home?

781
00:48:49,120 --> 00:48:50,600
Ha? Ha?

782
00:48:50,640 --> 00:48:53,040
Ha? Ah?

Ugh! Argh! Argh! Argh! Argh!

784
00:48:55,200 --> 00:48:57,720
OK. Very interesting presentation.

785
00:48:57,760 --> 00:49:00,160
- Ooh!
- Gave is a lot to think about.

786
00:49:00,200 --> 00:49:03,480
But, let's be honest,
truthful, real truthful,

787
00:49:03,520 --> 00:49:07,160
- you never went to the future.
- Yes, she did.

788
00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:10,120
- Huh?
- Huh? - And I can attest to it.

789
00:49:11,640 --> 00:49:16,280
- What is that thing?
- I don't know but sick do.

790
00:49:16,320 --> 00:49:20,120
The name is Clarance.
I'm a dog, part poodle, part...

791
00:49:20,160 --> 00:49:22,640
It's hard to know.
My mother was very social.

792
00:49:22,680 --> 00:49:26,240
You came. You've gotta tell
the flummels they're in trouble.

793
00:49:26,280 --> 00:49:30,320
Oh, they most certainly
are in trouble... from me.

794
00:49:30,360 --> 00:49:33,640
- Huh?
- (CACKLES)

795
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:35,960
Hey, wait, where are you going?

796
00:49:37,640 --> 00:49:38,640
Huh?

797
00:49:39,520 --> 00:49:41,040
- (BEEPING)
- Argh!

798
00:49:41,800 --> 00:49:43,800
(YELLING)

799
00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:52,040
OK. So, she might have
been telling the truth.

800
00:49:52,080 --> 00:49:55,080
Ugh! Oh!

801
00:49:55,120 --> 00:49:57,800
Ahhh! Argh!

802
00:50:01,520 --> 00:50:03,320
Hiya.

803
00:50:04,320 --> 00:50:07,800
Why did you do that?
And why did you do this?

804
00:50:07,840 --> 00:50:12,080
Because I hate you.

805
00:50:12,120 --> 00:50:16,760
I hate all flummels.
Hate, hate, hate, hate, hate.

806
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:19,880
Flummels ruined my life.

807
00:50:21,280 --> 00:50:24,240
I was a puppy once,
adorable and spunky,

808
00:50:24,280 --> 00:50:26,920
just waiting for a family
to take me home.

809
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:31,120
But, unfortunately,
I lived in a world of flummels.

810
00:50:31,160 --> 00:50:35,600
And flummels were the most
popular pet in the world.

811
00:50:35,640 --> 00:50:38,200
Everyone wanted
those stupid roundos.

812
00:50:38,240 --> 00:50:41,640
"Oh, they're cute.
I can see through you."

813
00:50:41,680 --> 00:50:45,560
I get it. Nobody wanted
a dog with a stomach.

814
00:50:48,520 --> 00:50:51,720
But then, one day, my luck changed.

815
00:50:51,760 --> 00:50:54,560
He's perfect. I'll take him.

816
00:50:54,600 --> 00:50:57,400
I couldn't believe it.
This man wanted me.

817
00:50:57,440 --> 00:51:01,000
And he even loved me enough
to give me a name.

818
00:51:01,040 --> 00:51:04,000
You're coming home with me,
Clarance.

819
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:09,880
I was expecting a warm bed
and a fresh pile of newspapers.

820
00:51:09,920 --> 00:51:14,000
- Sit. - But instead, I got something better.
- Good boy.

821
00:51:14,040 --> 00:51:17,440
It was then that I realised
I was more than just a pet.

822
00:51:17,480 --> 00:51:19,920
I was a part of science.

823
00:51:30,520 --> 00:51:33,480
It's the top of the fifth inning
as The Bambino steps to the plate.

824
00:51:33,520 --> 00:51:35,520
He's calling a home-run shot.

825
00:51:35,560 --> 00:51:37,960
He's pointing to a dog
on a tiny little car.

826
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:39,720
Oh, Doctor, I don't believe it.

827
00:51:42,280 --> 00:51:45,880
It worked. Now, let's go together.

828
00:51:45,920 --> 00:51:47,920
I loved that man.

829
00:51:47,960 --> 00:51:51,600
I finally felt I belonged
somewhere, right by his side,

830
00:51:51,640 --> 00:51:55,160
adventuring through
time and history together.

831
00:52:05,520 --> 00:52:09,880
But then, one day,
we travelled to 1835,

832
00:52:09,920 --> 00:52:12,320
to this island.

833
00:52:14,320 --> 00:52:17,960
And there we found a bunch
of these stupid napkin rings.

834
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,000
- (BELL RINGS) - Huh?
- Huh?

835
00:52:24,680 --> 00:52:28,040
Dr Chung told me this was when
Darwin first discovered flummels

836
00:52:28,080 --> 00:52:31,520
and introduced them
to the rest of the world.

837
00:52:31,560 --> 00:52:34,920
- (GROWLS)
- Oh, my goodness, look at you.

838
00:52:34,960 --> 00:52:37,440
Isn't she cute, Clarance?

839
00:52:37,480 --> 00:52:39,280
- He loved them.
- (LAUGHS)

840
00:52:39,320 --> 00:52:42,880
He was gonna love flummels
more than me. And then it hit me.

841
00:52:42,920 --> 00:52:47,400
I didn't have to accept the course
of history, I could change it.

842
00:52:47,440 --> 00:52:49,720
I think we're all set.

843
00:52:49,760 --> 00:52:53,120
Ready for our next adventure,
Clarance? Clarance?

844
00:52:53,160 --> 00:52:55,920
Ugh! Help me.

845
00:52:55,960 --> 00:52:57,680
Argh!

846
00:52:57,720 --> 00:53:00,600
Yeah, that's right.
I turned on my master.

847
00:53:00,640 --> 00:53:03,920
I'm a bad guy. That's what we do.

848
00:53:05,560 --> 00:53:11,240
I pushed him though a portal and
made sure he could never come back.

849
00:53:13,400 --> 00:53:16,920
After that, there was nothing
stopping me from coming back here

850
00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:19,240
and destroying your entire species.

851
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:23,320
It wasn't a volcano, it was me.

852
00:53:23,360 --> 00:53:26,680
- (BEEPING)
- Mass explosive device activated.

853
00:53:26,720 --> 00:53:30,480
- Now, back to some smooth jazz.
- (SMOOTH JAZZ PLAYS)

854
00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:39,240
It was a quick trip
but I got a lot done that day.

855
00:53:44,640 --> 00:53:49,120
Three, two, one. Zero flummels.

856
00:53:52,200 --> 00:53:54,200
Mission accomplished.

857
00:53:55,400 --> 00:53:59,720
And it was all a done deal
until you two hula-hoops showed up.

858
00:53:59,760 --> 00:54:01,760
But it's all about to be fixed

859
00:54:01,800 --> 00:54:04,200
because your brother
is back with the other cowards

860
00:54:04,240 --> 00:54:07,080
who never leave their
precious little time terminal.

861
00:54:07,120 --> 00:54:09,640
And you're not
getting off this island alive.

862
00:54:09,680 --> 00:54:12,600
Flummel extinction in 30 minutes.

863
00:54:12,640 --> 00:54:15,240
30 minutes?
That's more time than I thought.

864
00:54:15,280 --> 00:54:18,240
- It's not a lot of time but...
- Yeah. I meant to only set it for three,

865
00:54:18,280 --> 00:54:21,840
these stupid clumsy paws.
You know what? It don't matter.

866
00:54:21,880 --> 00:54:26,480
You've got a front row seat to your
species and your own extinction.

867
00:54:26,520 --> 00:54:29,000
- Ta-ta.
- Hm!

868
00:54:29,040 --> 00:54:30,640
- Ugh! Ugh! Ugh!
- (CACKLES)

869
00:54:30,680 --> 00:54:33,480
- (CACKLES)
- (GRUNTS)

870
00:54:39,360 --> 00:54:41,720
Ooh! Ah-ah! (LAUGHS)

871
00:54:41,760 --> 00:54:45,320
(LAUGHS)
She's too funny to stay mad at.

872
00:54:45,360 --> 00:54:49,200
(GASPS) Look, look.
I found Dr Chung.

873
00:54:49,240 --> 00:54:51,040
- Huh?
- What?

874
00:54:51,880 --> 00:54:55,840
I just returned with the
last Tasmanian tiger on Earth.

875
00:54:55,880 --> 00:54:57,840
It scratched me up pretty good.

876
00:54:59,280 --> 00:55:02,680
What? I don't get into
cars with strangers.

877
00:55:03,760 --> 00:55:07,720
And we're recording.
Inventor log, June 20th.

878
00:55:07,760 --> 00:55:10,080
That's the day he went missing.

879
00:55:10,120 --> 00:55:12,320
Today, I'm visiting
one of my heroes,

880
00:55:12,360 --> 00:55:14,320
the great explorer, Zheng He.

881
00:55:14,360 --> 00:55:17,280
He created one of the first
nautical maps ever.

882
00:55:17,320 --> 00:55:20,240
Who knows? Maybe I'll even
get to see him drawing it up.

883
00:55:20,280 --> 00:55:24,360
(LAUGHS) Now, off to 1417.

884
00:55:24,400 --> 00:55:27,480
- 1417, he said 1417.
- OK. - We know where he went now.

885
00:55:27,520 --> 00:55:30,800
Ready for your next adventure,
Clarance? Clarance?

886
00:55:30,840 --> 00:55:33,600
Ugh! Help me!

887
00:55:33,640 --> 00:55:35,280
Argh!

888
00:55:35,320 --> 00:55:37,120
- (THEY GASP)
- Clarance did that?

889
00:55:37,160 --> 00:55:39,800
What kind of conspiracy nut am I
if I didn't see that coming?

890
00:55:39,840 --> 00:55:43,680
But we could still save Dr Chung
if we just use whatever seeds...

891
00:55:46,800 --> 00:55:51,560
- Or not.
- Oh! I can't believe we finally know where Dr Chung is

892
00:55:51,600 --> 00:55:55,160
- and there's no way to bring him back.
- Unless...

893
00:55:56,280 --> 00:55:58,280
Ah-ha!

894
00:56:02,480 --> 00:56:04,320
1418.

895
00:56:06,120 --> 00:56:10,320
No, no. Dr Chung said
he was going to 1417, remember?

896
00:56:10,360 --> 00:56:12,360
Yes. To visit Zheng He,

897
00:56:12,400 --> 00:56:15,760
which means he probably
joined his expedition to Malacca,

898
00:56:15,800 --> 00:56:19,200
1418, where there's
another time flower.

899
00:56:21,640 --> 00:56:24,600
We just need some sort of
beacon to lead him to it.

900
00:56:24,640 --> 00:56:26,640
Sure, but what?

901
00:56:26,680 --> 00:56:28,680
(MUSIC PLAYS)

902
00:56:30,800 --> 00:56:34,600
- (LAUGHS) Perfect.
- We should also give him the brochure.

903
00:56:36,920 --> 00:56:38,920
(SIGHS)

904
00:56:45,920 --> 00:56:48,160
- Ed?
- Op, I'm so sorry

905
00:56:48,200 --> 00:56:52,000
- I didn't mean...
- Flummel extinction in 15 minutes.

906
00:56:52,040 --> 00:56:55,360
(GASPS) Wait, what's that thing?
Huh? Huh?

907
00:56:55,400 --> 00:56:57,400
What's going on?

908
00:56:57,440 --> 00:57:01,000
(SIGHS)
A volcano didn't make us extinct.

909
00:57:01,040 --> 00:57:05,280
Clarance did with that bomb and now
he's trapped the others in the cave

910
00:57:05,320 --> 00:57:07,240
and he trapped me
against this tree and...

911
00:57:07,280 --> 00:57:10,000
(SIGHS) Well, it's all over.

912
00:57:12,720 --> 00:57:17,640
No, it's not over because
we both didn't agree that it is.

913
00:57:17,680 --> 00:57:20,040
I was so wrong to say what I said

914
00:57:20,080 --> 00:57:22,560
and I want you to know
that I didn't mean it.

915
00:57:22,600 --> 00:57:25,200
All you've ever done is support me

916
00:57:25,240 --> 00:57:28,640
and my life would
be nothing without you.

917
00:57:28,680 --> 00:57:32,440
What are you talking about? I can't
do anything right. You know it.

918
00:57:32,480 --> 00:57:35,000
I know it. The rest of the
flummels certainly know it and...

919
00:57:35,040 --> 00:57:39,000
Who cares what the flummels think?
(LAUGHS) I'm serious.

920
00:57:39,040 --> 00:57:41,800
I've spent so long
worried about fitting in

921
00:57:41,840 --> 00:57:44,400
with all the other flummels
that I never even noticed

922
00:57:44,440 --> 00:57:49,040
this is where I fit in best,
right here with you.

923
00:57:49,080 --> 00:57:52,240
Come on, I screw up all the time.

924
00:57:52,280 --> 00:57:54,280
But if it weren't
for your screw-ups,

925
00:57:54,320 --> 00:57:56,800
then we would've never
even fallen through that flower.

926
00:57:56,840 --> 00:57:59,200
And, thanks to you, we have a chance

927
00:57:59,240 --> 00:58:02,080
to rescue our species
from extinction.

928
00:58:04,120 --> 00:58:06,120
So, what now?

929
00:58:06,160 --> 00:58:08,720
I'll tell you what now.
We're gonna save the flummels

930
00:58:08,760 --> 00:58:12,320
because they'd do the same thing for
us if it was the other way around.

931
00:58:12,360 --> 00:58:14,400
Probably.

932
00:58:14,440 --> 00:58:16,840
(LAUGHS)

933
00:58:21,760 --> 00:58:23,720
You think you can
get me out of this thing?

934
00:58:23,760 --> 00:58:26,360
No problem. There's only
a million combinations here.

935
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:30,360
Nope. Nope.

936
00:58:31,560 --> 00:58:33,080
Nope.

937
00:58:47,880 --> 00:58:51,520
Thanks, guys. Next time I poke you,
it's gonna be a lot softer.

938
00:58:51,560 --> 00:58:53,560
Come on, Op,
we're not gonna let that

939
00:58:53,600 --> 00:58:55,560
adorable maniac get away with this.

940
00:58:57,720 --> 00:59:00,000
Hello? Yoo-hoo.

941
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:03,160
(HUMS)

942
00:59:08,280 --> 00:59:10,280
Huh?

943
00:59:11,360 --> 00:59:12,520
Huh?

944
00:59:13,600 --> 00:59:15,600
What the...?

945
00:59:15,640 --> 00:59:17,640
Oh, no, no, no, it can't be.

946
00:59:19,320 --> 00:59:20,880
Argh! Huh?

947
00:59:20,920 --> 00:59:22,640
Oh!

948
00:59:22,680 --> 00:59:25,280
Why won't these flummels just die?

949
00:59:25,320 --> 00:59:27,960
Looks like I may need some help.

950
00:59:29,440 --> 00:59:31,040
Big help.

951
00:59:31,080 --> 00:59:34,760
Ugh! Ugh! How much time
before the bomb goes off?

952
00:59:34,800 --> 00:59:37,960
Flummel extinction in nine minutes.

953
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:41,960
I know it wants to kill us but
you have to admit it is helpful.

954
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:44,760
Don't worry.
You'll be long gone by then.

955
00:59:44,800 --> 00:59:49,120
What are you gonna do, fuzz ball?
There's only one you and two us's.

956
00:59:49,160 --> 00:59:51,160
Funny you should mention that.

957
00:59:51,200 --> 00:59:54,440
(GRUNTS)

958
00:59:54,480 --> 00:59:56,000
What is that?

959
00:59:56,040 --> 00:59:58,360
(YELLS)

960
00:59:58,400 --> 01:00:01,000
Meet my Cyclops.
And in case you were wondering

961
01:00:01,040 --> 01:00:03,880
if ancient Greek monsters
were real, they were.

962
01:00:03,920 --> 01:00:06,280
OK, Greg, you know what to do.

963
01:00:06,320 --> 01:00:10,800
- Whoa!

- Huh?

968
01:00:23,400 --> 01:00:25,480
Oh! Ugh!

969
01:00:29,800 --> 01:00:32,640
ALL: Extinctables, ready for action.

970
01:00:32,680 --> 01:00:34,720
Burnie.

971
01:00:34,760 --> 01:00:36,920
Hoss. Ugh!

972
01:00:36,960 --> 01:00:38,560
Alma. (HOOTS)

973
01:00:38,600 --> 01:00:41,480
And Dottie.
I just drove for the first time

974
01:00:41,520 --> 01:00:44,320
and, so far,
I've only hit one pedestrian.

975
01:00:44,360 --> 01:00:46,960
- Guys.
- You left the terminal.

976
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:50,120
The best decision
I've made in a long time.

977
01:00:50,160 --> 01:00:52,520
- (ROARING)
- Or the worst decision.

978
01:00:52,560 --> 01:00:55,920
- Everybody, back in the truck.
- I told you there were Cyclopses.

(THUDDING)

988
01:01:28,680 --> 01:01:31,680
Crikey! That one eye makes for
pretty poor depth perception.

989
01:01:31,720 --> 01:01:33,720
He couldn't hit
the broadside of a Hoss.

990
01:01:33,760 --> 01:01:35,520
- No offence, Hoss.
- None taken.

991
01:01:35,560 --> 01:01:37,360
You're right. Follow my lead.

992
01:01:37,400 --> 01:01:41,560
- Hey, Cyclops, bet you can't hit me.
- Hmm? - Bet you can't hit me.

993
01:01:41,600 --> 01:01:44,280
Need a target? Hundred points if
you get it through the bull's-eye.

- Yeah!

- No, Greg.

- It's working.
- Ugh! Ugh! Ugh!

- Argh!

- I hate you all...

ugly wet-looking dog.

01:02:28,520 --> 01:02:30,520
(MURMURING)

1009
01:02:34,360 --> 01:02:39,360
(CLEARS THROAT) So I spent a lot of
my cave time thinking about you two

1010
01:02:39,400 --> 01:02:42,320
and what I would do if we
ever got out of there alive.

1011
01:02:42,360 --> 01:02:45,200
I settled on this.

1012
01:02:45,240 --> 01:02:46,640
Ugh!

1013
01:02:46,680 --> 01:02:48,680
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

1014
01:02:50,440 --> 01:02:52,720
Ah! You think maybe
we could do this later?

1015
01:02:52,760 --> 01:02:55,360
- (POPPING)
- The whole island is about to blow up.

1016
01:02:55,400 --> 01:02:59,520
Correct.
Flummel extinction in seven minutes.

1017
01:02:59,560 --> 01:03:02,640
- (THEY GASP)
- What do we do, Jepson?

1018
01:03:02,680 --> 01:03:05,000
The only thing we can do,

1019
01:03:05,040 --> 01:03:09,800
we ask Op and Ed
and then we do whatever they say.

1020
01:03:09,840 --> 01:03:12,040
Ed, what do you think?

1021
01:03:12,080 --> 01:03:15,360
Er, well, um...

1022
01:03:15,400 --> 01:03:17,840
- (BELL RINGS)
- Oh!

1023
01:03:19,360 --> 01:03:23,320
The ship. That's Charles Darwin,
the man from the museum movie.

1024
01:03:23,360 --> 01:03:26,560
If we make it to the beach,
he might be able to save us.

1025
01:03:26,600 --> 01:03:28,240
- Movie?
- Man?

1026
01:03:28,280 --> 01:03:32,120
Save? Wait, I know what
that means and it's good.

1027
01:03:32,160 --> 01:03:35,280
- (CHEERING)
- But what are those?

1028
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:39,920
Jepson, meet the extinctables.

1029
01:03:39,960 --> 01:03:42,240
(LAUGHS) Welcome.

1030
01:03:42,280 --> 01:03:45,760
Is something wrong with them?
They don't have any holes.

1031
01:03:58,960 --> 01:04:01,200
Stay, Hoss, sit.

1032
01:04:12,040 --> 01:04:14,600
Jepson, you get everyone to the
beach. We'll meet you down there

1033
01:04:14,640 --> 01:04:17,200
after we get this Darwin guy's
attention with the sky flowers.

1034
01:04:17,240 --> 01:04:20,040
- Sky flowers?
- Hit it, Burnie.

1035
01:04:27,360 --> 01:04:29,560
All right. Go, go, go.

1036
01:04:30,440 --> 01:04:32,840
FLUMMELS: Whoa!

1037
01:04:32,880 --> 01:04:35,600
Er, but these flummels
haven't been sanitised.

1038
01:04:35,640 --> 01:04:39,400
- No time, just go. Hi-yah.
- Oh, this is my nightmare.

1039
01:04:39,440 --> 01:04:43,280
Wait. I just wanna say
thanks for everything

1040
01:04:43,320 --> 01:04:45,200
and try not to fall to your death.

1041
01:04:45,240 --> 01:04:48,480
Of course not.
What do you think I am, a dodo?

1042
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:53,480
Didgeridoo!

1043
01:04:53,520 --> 01:04:55,760
FLUMMELS: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1044
01:04:55,800 --> 01:04:57,640
(LAUGHS)

1045
01:05:05,600 --> 01:05:07,600
FLUMMELS:
Ugh! Ugh! Ugh! Ugh! Ugh! Ugh!

1046
01:05:07,640 --> 01:05:10,480
FLUMMELS: Whoa!

1047
01:05:15,400 --> 01:05:19,640
- FLUMMELS: Ooh!
- Oh, because they look like flowers in the sky.

1048
01:05:19,680 --> 01:05:22,800
Hey, tell whoever came up
with that name, great job.

1049
01:05:25,960 --> 01:05:28,160
What in blazes?

1050
01:05:31,320 --> 01:05:33,320
(GASPS) My goodness!

1051
01:05:33,360 --> 01:05:36,400
So many magnificent creatures.

1052
01:05:36,440 --> 01:05:39,000
Can we go? Please, please,
please, please, please.

1053
01:05:39,040 --> 01:05:43,880
- Oh! Fine. But this is the last island.
- Yippee.

1054
01:05:46,320 --> 01:05:48,960
He sees us! Op and Ed did it.

1055
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:51,160
Whoa! That felt weird to say.

1056
01:05:55,480 --> 01:05:57,080
Uh-oh.

1057
01:05:57,120 --> 01:06:00,400
Ah, now, that's
the Op and Ed I know.

1058
01:06:02,480 --> 01:06:04,200
Oops!

1059
01:06:04,240 --> 01:06:06,680
Yeah, who'd have thought
our aim would be too good?

1060
01:06:06,720 --> 01:06:08,600
(THUDDING)

1061
01:06:08,640 --> 01:06:11,600
(ROARS)

1062
01:06:11,640 --> 01:06:13,960
- (THEY SCREAM)
- Ugh!

1063
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:16,360
Ugh! Eeerrgghh!

1064
01:06:16,400 --> 01:06:18,440
- Ugh-ugh!
- Hey, there, big fella.

1065
01:06:18,480 --> 01:06:21,760
You don't wanna eat us.
Just eat me, let Ed live.

1066
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:26,400
- Mmm! Hmmm?
- That's nice what you said out there,

1067
01:06:26,440 --> 01:06:29,440
- you know, outside of the mouth.
- I meant it.

1068
01:06:29,480 --> 01:06:32,800
I hope he swallows me first just
so you can live a little longer.

1069
01:06:32,840 --> 01:06:36,440
I hope he swallows me first.
I don't wanna see you swallowed.

1070
01:06:36,480 --> 01:06:38,840
- Ed!
- Oh, Op!

1071
01:06:38,880 --> 01:06:40,880
(CRIES)

1072
01:06:42,960 --> 01:06:46,760
We're alive and smell
like Cyclops' breath.

1073
01:06:46,800 --> 01:06:50,800
- Behind that big eye there's an even bigger heart.
- Oh!

1074
01:06:50,840 --> 01:06:54,440
- And by the way, you have a cavity.
- Op, I don't think that ship

1075
01:06:54,480 --> 01:06:56,480
is gonna get here
in time to save us.

1076
01:06:56,520 --> 01:07:00,080
- I've got an idea.
- I knew you would.

1077
01:07:02,760 --> 01:07:05,680
So the Cyclops will
throw us to the time flower,

1078
01:07:05,720 --> 01:07:08,560
we'll take it to the beach and
we'll take everyone through it

1079
01:07:08,600 --> 01:07:12,160
- before the bomb goes off.
- Right. Great repeating the plan, Ed.

1080
01:07:13,160 --> 01:07:16,280
- Hmmmm!
- Hey, you can do it, big guy.

1081
01:07:16,320 --> 01:07:18,320
We believe in you.

1082
01:07:20,080 --> 01:07:21,680
Uh-hmm.

1083
01:07:21,720 --> 01:07:23,560
- Ugh! - Wait, wait, wait.
- Hmm?

1084
01:07:23,600 --> 01:07:26,520
Maybe try throwing underhand.

1085
01:07:26,560 --> 01:07:28,040
Ah!

1086
01:07:28,080 --> 01:07:29,360
Ugh!

1087
01:07:29,400 --> 01:07:31,280
BOTH: Whoa!

1088
01:07:31,320 --> 01:07:32,920
- Ohhhh!
- Oh!

1089
01:07:32,960 --> 01:07:34,640
- Ugh!
- Ugh! - Oh! - Ugh!

1090
01:07:34,680 --> 01:07:38,320
BOTH: Whoa! Argh! Argh! Whoa!

1091
01:07:38,360 --> 01:07:41,360
- Ugh! - (SIGHS) - Oh! - Ah!
- Ah!

1092
01:07:41,400 --> 01:07:44,160
(THEY LAUGH)

1093
01:07:44,200 --> 01:07:46,440
Nice aim, Greg, you're a natural.

1094
01:07:46,480 --> 01:07:49,000
(LAUGHS) Whoo!

1095
01:07:49,040 --> 01:07:51,520
Ugh! Oh! Hmm.

1096
01:07:51,560 --> 01:07:53,160
Booby.

1097
01:07:55,280 --> 01:07:58,360
- Most remarkable.
- Hmm.

1098
01:08:00,840 --> 01:08:03,520
If I didn't know any better,
I'd say these creatures

1099
01:08:03,560 --> 01:08:06,320
- are trying to communicate with us.
- Perhaps they're adapting

1100
01:08:06,360 --> 01:08:08,480
to the changes around them
in order to survive,

1101
01:08:08,520 --> 01:08:11,920
almost as if they're, I don't know,
evolving or something.

1102
01:08:11,960 --> 01:08:14,920
That's rubbish. (LAUGHS)

1103
01:08:16,440 --> 01:08:18,760
Evolving.

1104
01:08:18,800 --> 01:08:20,800
This way.

1105
01:08:25,240 --> 01:08:27,360
Drop it, fruit loops.

1106
01:08:28,440 --> 01:08:31,680
This island's about to blow and
there's only gonna be one survivor

1107
01:08:31,720 --> 01:08:34,720
and that's me.
So hand over that time flower.

1108
01:08:37,880 --> 01:08:40,280
I said hand it over.

1109
01:08:41,840 --> 01:08:46,280
- BOTH: Op Hop.
- Hey. Oh! Son of a...

1110
01:08:47,280 --> 01:08:49,280
- Nice Op Hop.
- I learned from the best.

1111
01:08:50,600 --> 01:08:52,720
Get back here.

1112
01:09:00,320 --> 01:09:04,280
Whoa.
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!

1113
01:09:07,360 --> 01:09:09,640
Ugh! Oh, oh, oh! Argh!

1114
01:09:12,320 --> 01:09:14,600
Whoa! Ow! Ow!

1115
01:09:14,640 --> 01:09:16,840
Ow! Ow! Argh!

1116
01:09:16,880 --> 01:09:19,120
Whoa! Ohhh!

1117
01:09:20,600 --> 01:09:21,720
Argh!

1118
01:09:21,760 --> 01:09:25,000
Op, look. It's the beach.

1119
01:09:26,200 --> 01:09:28,560
Argh!

1120
01:09:28,600 --> 01:09:31,560
Dang! I always forget
about this cliff.

1121
01:09:31,600 --> 01:09:33,640
End of the line, zeros.

1122
01:09:33,680 --> 01:09:36,880
Ugh! Now hand over that flower.

1123
01:09:36,920 --> 01:09:40,440
- (CACKLES) - I'm out of ideas.
- Huh?

1124
01:09:41,680 --> 01:09:44,520
I might have one
and it's kind of an Op idea.

1125
01:09:44,560 --> 01:09:46,200
- (SQUEALS)
- Huh?

1126
01:09:48,760 --> 01:09:52,320
Ooh! Ow! Ow! Ooh! Ooh!
Ugh! Oh! Ow! Ooh! Ooh! Ow!

1127
01:09:52,360 --> 01:09:54,120
- Ugh!
- Ooh!

1128
01:09:55,240 --> 01:09:58,600
Are you crazy?
You almost got us killed, Ed.

1129
01:09:58,640 --> 01:10:01,920
Whoa! Is this how I make
you feel all the time?

1130
01:10:01,960 --> 01:10:05,040
- Pretty much.
- I am so sorry.

1131
01:10:05,080 --> 01:10:07,520
Forget it. Now, time flowers.

1132
01:10:07,560 --> 01:10:11,440
Time flowers? How many times did
you hit your head on the way down?

1133
01:10:11,480 --> 01:10:13,920
Five or six. Ah-ha!

1134
01:10:18,320 --> 01:10:22,600
OK. Great. Now we have three time
flowers. What good does...? (GASPS)

1135
01:10:22,640 --> 01:10:24,320
BOTH: Burnie's trick.

1136
01:10:24,360 --> 01:10:27,840
Yoo-hoo!
Flummel extinction in two minutes.

1137
01:10:27,880 --> 01:10:30,480
- Would you shut up?
- Shutting up initiated.

1138
01:10:30,560 --> 01:10:33,200
- Shutting up in four minutes.
- Nnnggghhh!

1139
01:10:34,920 --> 01:10:38,360
- They're not gonna make it.
- Neither are we.

1140
01:10:45,280 --> 01:10:47,920
OK, Ed. Try something else.

1141
01:10:47,960 --> 01:10:50,280
Something other than
lighting a boat on fire.

1142
01:10:53,080 --> 01:10:55,800
- Do you think this will work?
- I have no idea.

1143
01:11:04,400 --> 01:11:08,200
- No! Stop!
- Flummel extinction in 30 seconds.

1144
01:11:09,200 --> 01:11:11,880
I've got to get
this bomb away from me.

1145
01:11:11,920 --> 01:11:13,800
Argh!

1146
01:11:13,840 --> 01:11:17,240
No, go up. Up! No!

1147
01:11:18,760 --> 01:11:20,640
- Presto.
- Change-o.

sailed here with the

1162

He claimed that there
was an island here

1163
01:12:16,160 --> 01:12:19,080
that exploded and completely
vanished. (LAUGHS)

1164

01:12:54,600 --> 01:12:57,400
You're alive. You're all alive.

1175
01:13:00,200 --> 01:13:02,280
(LAUGHS) We're saved.

1176
01:13:02,320 --> 01:13:06,840
Yes, thanks to Op and Ed,
we are de-extincted.

1177
01:13:06,880 --> 01:13:08,880
I assume that's a word.

1178
01:13:08,920 --> 01:13:10,480
(CHEERING)

1179
01:13:13,160 --> 01:13:16,040
So, were you worried about me?

1180
01:13:16,080 --> 01:13:19,680
Maybe just a little. (LAUGHS)

1181
01:13:19,720 --> 01:13:21,480
(LAUGHS)

1182
01:13:26,480 --> 01:13:30,520
Ohhh!
Er... Huh?

1183
01:13:30,560 --> 01:13:33,360
Hey, I'm uncomfortable.

1184
01:13:33,400 --> 01:13:37,200
You did it. What exactly did you do?

1185
01:13:37,240 --> 01:13:40,040
Burnie's trick on a grand scale.

1186
01:13:40,080 --> 01:13:42,040
We used every
time flower we could find

1187
01:13:42,080 --> 01:13:44,560
to make the whole island disappear
before the bomb went off.

1188
01:13:44,600 --> 01:13:48,440
My trick? I was right about
the flowers and the Cyclops.

1189
01:13:48,480 --> 01:13:52,600
What else am I right about?
Oh, this is terrifying.

1190
01:13:53,600 --> 01:13:55,680
This isn't over.

1191
01:13:55,720 --> 01:13:57,720
Booby.

1192
01:13:58,840 --> 01:14:00,360
- (THEY GASP)
- (CACKLES)

1193
01:14:00,400 --> 01:14:02,400
I'll just get back in that flower

1194
01:14:02,440 --> 01:14:04,720
and I'll keep trying again and again

1195
01:14:04,760 --> 01:14:06,840
until you're all extinct.

1196
01:14:06,880 --> 01:14:08,880
- Sit!
- Sitting.

1197
01:14:08,920 --> 01:14:10,920
(MUSIC PLAYS)

1198
01:14:13,040 --> 01:14:16,000
It worked. Dr Chung made it back.

1199
01:14:17,360 --> 01:14:21,680
You've been a very bad dog,
Clarance.

1200
01:14:21,720 --> 01:14:24,160
- Oh, I haven't started.
- Lay down.

1201
01:14:24,200 --> 01:14:26,920
- When I'm done... - Beg.
- ..you'll feel the wrath of my...

1202
01:14:26,960 --> 01:14:29,240
Play dead.

1203
01:14:29,280 --> 01:14:31,960
Cursed by obedience.

1204
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:34,640
Flummelios hidella.

1205
01:14:34,680 --> 01:14:36,680
As adorable as ever.

1206
01:14:36,720 --> 01:14:39,280
And my extinctables?

1207
01:14:39,320 --> 01:14:41,000
(LAUGHS)

1208
01:14:41,040 --> 01:14:46,400
Oh, it's so good to see you
and you and you and... you?

1209
01:14:46,440 --> 01:14:48,640
Ooh!

1210
01:14:48,680 --> 01:14:50,000
(LAUGHS)

1211
01:14:50,040 --> 01:14:52,560
- (THEY LAUGH)
- (HORN SOUNDS)

1212
01:14:56,240 --> 01:14:58,440
When are we?

1213
01:14:58,480 --> 01:15:03,240
I think you should be asking
when are... No, wait. You got it.

1214
01:15:06,520 --> 01:15:08,760
Today, we celebrate
the one-year anniversary

1215
01:15:08,800 --> 01:15:11,440
of the greatest discovery
of the 21st century,

1216
01:15:11,480 --> 01:15:15,120
a species once thought extinct,
flummels.

1217
01:15:15,160 --> 01:15:18,920
Yes, huggable,
lovable, adorable flummels

1218
01:15:18,960 --> 01:15:23,800
brought to us by famed botanical
astrophysicist Dr Lee Chung.

1219
01:15:25,520 --> 01:15:27,640
I'm so proud of you, Lee.

1220
01:15:27,680 --> 01:15:31,240
And you've been so much more
talkative since your discovery.

1221
01:15:32,800 --> 01:15:34,680
(THEY LAUGH)

1222
01:15:35,680 --> 01:15:36,840
Oh!

1223
01:15:41,720 --> 01:15:43,040
Ooh!

1224
01:15:46,400 --> 01:15:48,240
And she's back.

1225
01:15:48,280 --> 01:15:50,280
- How you been, sis?
- (LAUGHS)

1226
01:15:50,320 --> 01:15:53,520
Hey, look at you.
Friend at the end again, eh?

1227
01:15:53,560 --> 01:15:56,680
Nope. Fellow at the front.

1228
01:15:56,720 --> 01:15:59,120
Aww! And all without my help.

1229
01:15:59,160 --> 01:16:01,520
You and Dr Chung
visit any cool places lately?

1230
01:16:01,560 --> 01:16:04,840
You bet we have. It's been one
amazing adventure after another.

1231
01:16:04,880 --> 01:16:06,880
What did you guys
end up doing with Clarance?

1232
01:16:06,920 --> 01:16:08,920
Oh, he's cooling off.

1233
01:16:08,960 --> 01:16:13,200
No dog should have a master,
so on the count of three,

1234
01:16:13,240 --> 01:16:15,600
I say we tie up Shackleton,
take his ship

1235
01:16:15,640 --> 01:16:18,840
and head somewhere warm like Cabo.

1236
01:16:18,880 --> 01:16:21,000
(THEY GROWL)

1237
01:16:21,040 --> 01:16:23,160
OK. OK. We can change it up. Fiji?

1238
01:16:23,200 --> 01:16:27,040
San Diego? Rome? Paris? They let
dogs into restaurants there! Argh!

1239
01:16:27,080 --> 01:16:31,320
- Ready or not, Hoss. Here I come.
- (GIGGLES)

1240
01:16:32,720 --> 01:16:36,200
Great job, everyone.
And thanks for helping out, pals.

1241
01:16:37,560 --> 01:16:42,520
Hey, Op and Ed. Well, how do you
like this year's two-flower floats?

1242
01:16:42,560 --> 01:16:45,480
- Great.
- I look a little chunky.

1243
01:16:45,520 --> 01:16:48,720
I'm sorry your teeth are yellow.
We ran out of white flowers.

1244
01:16:48,760 --> 01:16:53,160
- Hmm!
- Hey, Ed, I have a little surprise for you.

1245
01:16:53,200 --> 01:16:56,280
- Come with me.
- Oh, yeah, I love surprises.

1246
01:16:56,320 --> 01:16:58,400
Except I just remembered
that I don't.

1247
01:16:58,440 --> 01:17:00,480
So tell me what it is
so I'm not too surprised.

1248
01:17:02,960 --> 01:17:06,520
What? Ha! Oh, God. Ohhh!

1249
01:17:09,080 --> 01:17:12,840
Don't worry, Ed. I'm sure you have
plenty of time to prepare for...

1250
01:17:12,880 --> 01:17:14,920
(CRACKING)

1251
01:17:16,640 --> 01:17:18,640
(CRACK / POP)

1252
01:18:22,080 --> 01:18:26,160
Op, I really don't know if I could
handle another surprise today.

1253
01:18:26,200 --> 01:18:28,520
Trust me, you're gonna love it.

1254
01:18:29,760 --> 01:18:33,160
Hey, I haven't seen you
since, what, like 1835?

1255
01:18:33,200 --> 01:18:35,480
There's so much to talk about.

1256
01:18:35,520 --> 01:18:37,920
You two keep going.
I'll go get him a glass of water.

1257
01:18:39,144 --> 01:18:44,144
