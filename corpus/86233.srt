1
00:00:24,775 --> 00:00:26,401
I just love mushrooms.

2
00:00:26,568 --> 00:00:29,446
One of my favorites,
or as I call it...

3
00:00:29,613 --> 00:00:33,450
...the king of mushrooms,
is the porcini.

4
00:00:33,617 --> 00:00:35,744
Now, stop right there.

5
00:00:35,953 --> 00:00:37,454
Don't be alarmed.

6
00:00:37,621 --> 00:00:42,584
There's a lot of confusion
in this country between porcini...

7
00:00:42,793 --> 00:00:44,086
...the Italian name, and cèpes,
which is the French name.

8
00:00:44,086 --> 00:00:48,173
...the Italian name, and cèpes,
which is the French name.

9
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:51,343
They're fat and they're earthy.

10
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:56,515
Now, the porcini is most often seen
dried here in this country.

11
00:00:56,974 --> 00:00:59,434
And they would always be labeled...

12
00:01:00,936 --> 00:01:04,231
...dried porcinis, not dried cèpes.
- Beck!

13
00:01:04,398 --> 00:01:08,110
- Come on!
- They are very, very, very flavorful.

14
00:01:14,992 --> 00:01:16,785
It's about time.
I've been waiting.

15
00:01:16,952 --> 00:01:21,665
Man, you're lucky to be getting in.
It's an extremely private party tonight.

16
00:01:22,749 --> 00:01:26,670
- What's he drinking?
- Jagermeister and Cristal.

17
00:01:26,837 --> 00:01:29,089
Great.

18
00:01:37,139 --> 00:01:40,517
- Security?
- No, but we do have a slight problem.

19
00:01:41,518 --> 00:01:43,478
Have fun.

20
00:01:45,105 --> 00:01:46,523
What's the problem?

21
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:50,527
That's your problem.

22
00:01:50,694 --> 00:01:52,654
The guy on the left
is Jalil Johnson.

23
00:01:52,863 --> 00:01:55,490
- I think he's the left tackle.
- Jamal Johnson.

24
00:01:55,657 --> 00:01:57,326
Defensive end.

25
00:01:57,534 --> 00:02:01,246
The best defensive lineman Notre
Dame's produced in the last 20 years.

26
00:02:01,413 --> 00:02:02,956
Maybe ever.

27
00:02:03,123 --> 00:02:05,709
The guy on his left
is kambui Jackson.

28
00:02:05,876 --> 00:02:10,172
He ran for 2000 yards last year,
All- Pro five years in a row.

29
00:02:10,756 --> 00:02:13,342
The guy in the headband,
that's Fernando Lewis.

30
00:02:13,509 --> 00:02:15,260
Middle linebacker.

31
00:02:15,469 --> 00:02:17,471
Plays a lot like Ray Lewis.

32
00:02:18,472 --> 00:02:21,475
- He just hits harder.
- Whatever. I'm not into football.

33
00:02:21,683 --> 00:02:24,853
The other two guys
are Jimmy Coggeshell...

34
00:02:25,062 --> 00:02:26,730
...and David Mulaire.

35
00:02:27,648 --> 00:02:30,150
One's from US C.
The other one's from Ohio State.

36
00:02:30,817 --> 00:02:32,027
Stay down, bitch!

37
00:02:32,236 --> 00:02:35,155
The guy you're looking for is there.
Brian knappmiller.

38
00:02:36,865 --> 00:02:38,825
Throws like Brett Favre.

39
00:02:38,992 --> 00:02:40,744
Bets like Pete Rose.

40
00:02:40,911 --> 00:02:44,540
So I'm telling this cat, I'm like,
"Yo, I know it's you that jumped.

41
00:02:44,748 --> 00:02:46,667
I saw you.
Don't tell me it's not you."

42
00:02:46,834 --> 00:02:48,585
He's like, "I don't know."

43
00:02:48,794 --> 00:02:51,463
- Excuse me.
- "Trust me. It's you, I know."

44
00:02:51,672 --> 00:02:54,091
Excuse me.
I'm sorry to bother you guys.

45
00:02:54,258 --> 00:02:55,884
- I apologize. I need- -
- My man.

46
00:02:56,093 --> 00:02:59,555
I ain't got no hookups to tryout
camps. You just gotta show up.

47
00:02:59,763 --> 00:03:01,181
I think you'll be all right.

48
00:03:01,348 --> 00:03:03,433
So I'm telling the cat,
"I don't want- -"

49
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:06,186
Excuse me. I'm not here
to talk about tryouts.

50
00:03:06,353 --> 00:03:08,981
- If I could have a minute- -
- I got it. Pass me that.

51
00:03:09,147 --> 00:03:11,942
Who do I make this out to, man?

52
00:03:12,359 --> 00:03:14,778
Who do I make it out to?
What's your name?

53
00:03:14,945 --> 00:03:16,655
- Beck.
- Beck?

54
00:03:16,822 --> 00:03:18,156
B- E- C- k.

55
00:03:19,283 --> 00:03:20,742
- What's up?
- What's happening?

56
00:03:20,909 --> 00:03:22,703
Here you go.
Knock yourself out.

57
00:03:22,911 --> 00:03:24,538
- All right?
- Thank you.

58
00:03:24,746 --> 00:03:27,916
What are you gonna do?
Are you gonna come back, or what?

59
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:31,420
Excuse me.

60
00:03:31,587 --> 00:03:33,964
- I'm really- -
- What are you doing, man?

61
00:03:34,131 --> 00:03:37,926
A couple of months ago, you made
wagers with an associate of mine.

62
00:03:38,093 --> 00:03:40,345
- Two, three months ago.
- What's up, knappy?

63
00:03:40,512 --> 00:03:43,265
- Nothing. It's good. Enjoy your drink.
- What's up?

64
00:03:44,016 --> 00:03:47,853
Yo, bets? You embarrass me
in front of friends about bets?

65
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:51,398
I don't mean to embarrass you.
This is embarrassing to me.

66
00:03:51,565 --> 00:03:54,985
- $50,000. You might remember.
- Yeah, I know what it is, man.

67
00:03:55,152 --> 00:03:58,155
Listen, there's a G to get me started.
Now do me a favor.

68
00:03:58,363 --> 00:04:00,824
Tell your man I'll see him Monday
with the rest...

69
00:04:01,033 --> 00:04:05,495
...and not to send anybody else
to see me, all right?

70
00:04:11,168 --> 00:04:13,128
Brian.

71
00:04:13,295 --> 00:04:15,297
I'm gonna need some collateral
from you.

72
00:04:15,506 --> 00:04:17,716
What?

73
00:04:18,592 --> 00:04:20,636
I'm gonna need the ring.

74
00:04:29,102 --> 00:04:31,939
- I'm sorry.
- You're- -? Are you- -?

75
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:34,900
Slip it under the table,
on the low- low.

76
00:04:35,108 --> 00:04:37,611
- I'll make sure you get it back.
- On the low- low.

77
00:04:37,861 --> 00:04:40,989
- I'll give it to you. Want a drink too?
- Thank you.

78
00:04:41,823 --> 00:04:44,201
Take the ring.
That's what I think about that.

79
00:04:44,368 --> 00:04:47,496
Get the hell on, man.
Go, man! Go!

80
00:04:47,663 --> 00:04:50,040
- Do something with this.
- You heard the man.

81
00:04:50,332 --> 00:04:52,835
Yo, man, get up!

82
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:55,504
Okay.

83
00:04:56,630 --> 00:05:00,342
Yeah, that's right, playboy, walk.
Go on, man!

84
00:05:00,509 --> 00:05:02,511
You wanna jump?

85
00:05:02,678 --> 00:05:04,137
Get your ass out of here.

86
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:14,731
You all right?

87
00:05:15,566 --> 00:05:17,609
This shit burns.

88
00:05:24,074 --> 00:05:25,325
Hey, it's me.

89
00:05:25,492 --> 00:05:28,287
Oh, yeah, he's here.
We got a problem, though.

90
00:05:28,453 --> 00:05:33,959
He's got the entire offensive line.
The entire offensive line is here.

91
00:05:35,252 --> 00:05:38,255
Let me do it another night.
How about that?

92
00:05:38,422 --> 00:05:40,507
They've got a shot
at repeating this year.

93
00:05:40,716 --> 00:05:43,510
I do not want to hurt them.
I don't want to go out- -

94
00:05:45,429 --> 00:05:47,931
Okay, Billy.

95
00:06:06,783 --> 00:06:09,077
Knappmiller!
You got two choices.

96
00:06:09,286 --> 00:06:11,455
Option A, you give me the ring.

97
00:06:11,663 --> 00:06:14,416
Option B,
I make you give me the ring.

98
00:06:14,958 --> 00:06:16,793
I'll take B.

99
00:06:18,170 --> 00:06:19,588
Wrong choice.

100
00:06:48,492 --> 00:06:49,952
Okay.

101
00:07:14,852 --> 00:07:16,395
Yeah, put him down, man!

102
00:07:43,046 --> 00:07:47,843
- Yo, what's with all this hostility?
- You should have taken option A.

103
00:08:39,770 --> 00:08:41,355
Are you all right, mate?

104
00:08:42,105 --> 00:08:44,066
Are you okay?

105
00:08:50,531 --> 00:08:52,241
Thanks, mate.

106
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:05,504
- There he is.
- Why'd you send him, Billy?

107
00:09:05,671 --> 00:09:08,382
Martin? Oh, he was just a backup.

108
00:09:08,549 --> 00:09:11,802
After I got your call,
I wasn't so sure you could deliver.

109
00:09:11,969 --> 00:09:14,054
- What happened?
- He stole it from me!

110
00:09:14,221 --> 00:09:18,016
He got you
with those beanbags? No.

111
00:09:18,183 --> 00:09:20,727
It is gonna be 10 off your vig,
anyway, you know.

112
00:09:20,894 --> 00:09:24,147
Billy, you know I've got plans!
Stop nickel- and- diming me.

113
00:09:24,314 --> 00:09:26,650
It's a tough business,
the restaurant business.

114
00:09:26,817 --> 00:09:30,279
I hear 75 percent of them fail
the first year. Do you know why?

115
00:09:30,487 --> 00:09:33,073
Undercapitalization, that's why.
I don't think- -

116
00:09:33,282 --> 00:09:37,661
Billy, I want out, I want a new life.
I want my money, and I want it now!

117
00:09:38,161 --> 00:09:40,122
Now?

118
00:09:40,998 --> 00:09:43,375
Now.

119
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:47,337
Okay.

120
00:09:53,218 --> 00:09:55,053
One job.

121
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:57,890
One job, I wipe your slate clean...

122
00:09:59,516 --> 00:10:02,561
...and you have your restaurant.

123
00:10:04,146 --> 00:10:06,440
Come on, open it up.

124
00:10:07,316 --> 00:10:09,234
Come on.

125
00:10:13,864 --> 00:10:16,617
That's a photo
of Travis Alfred Walker.

126
00:10:16,783 --> 00:10:20,078
Stanford dropout, treasure hunter.
Only to date...

127
00:10:20,245 --> 00:10:23,332
...the only thing he's found
is trouble.

128
00:10:23,499 --> 00:10:25,334
- Did you say, "Walker"?
- My son.

129
00:10:25,501 --> 00:10:28,170
From my third marriage.
Lasted about three minutes.

130
00:10:28,712 --> 00:10:30,756
That picture was taken
two months ago...

131
00:10:30,923 --> 00:10:34,676
...in some gold- mining town called El
Dorado in the middle of the Amazon.

132
00:10:34,843 --> 00:10:36,220
- How much?
- 250 large.

133
00:10:36,386 --> 00:10:38,847
For that much,
why not invite him back yourself?

134
00:10:39,014 --> 00:10:41,850
- The boy doesn't trust me.
- Kidnapping's gonna help.

135
00:10:42,518 --> 00:10:44,019
Is that sarcasm?

136
00:10:44,978 --> 00:10:47,648
You wanna be sarcastic,
do it to your monkey friends!

137
00:10:47,814 --> 00:10:51,693
You do not do it to me!
Do you understand?

138
00:10:55,489 --> 00:10:56,698
I'm sorry, Billy.

139
00:10:57,282 --> 00:10:59,576
You're goddamn right you are.

140
00:11:02,412 --> 00:11:05,624
- What'd he do?
- Pissed off the wrong people.

141
00:11:06,542 --> 00:11:10,003
I don't have to remind you
what happens when you do that, do I?

142
00:11:10,254 --> 00:11:11,964
So I bought him some forgiveness.

143
00:11:12,172 --> 00:11:14,716
But if I don't bring him back
to face the music...

144
00:11:14,925 --> 00:11:18,053
...you know damn well
that I can't carry a tune.

145
00:11:18,262 --> 00:11:23,100
So you deliver my boy back here,
you bring him right through that door...

146
00:11:23,267 --> 00:11:28,564
...you walk out of this house
a free man, with a restaurant.

147
00:12:03,724 --> 00:12:04,933
Is that duct tape?

148
00:12:08,478 --> 00:12:12,941
Don't worry there, little fella.
Walk by faith, not by sight.

149
00:12:18,655 --> 00:12:21,283
Will you look at that?
We can't land now.

150
00:12:21,491 --> 00:12:25,287
- Why? Why can't we land?
- They got the bulls on the ground.

151
00:12:25,829 --> 00:12:28,457
"Booze on the grind"?

152
00:12:28,665 --> 00:12:30,959
The bulls. On the ground.
Cattle down there.

153
00:12:31,168 --> 00:12:32,377
- Cows?
- Yeah.

154
00:12:32,544 --> 00:12:35,631
I'll give them a wee fright there.
Get moving! Come on!

155
00:12:36,256 --> 00:12:37,508
Out of me way!

156
00:12:38,175 --> 00:12:40,177
Out the way, you!

157
00:12:40,344 --> 00:12:42,471
Move it! Move it now!

158
00:12:46,266 --> 00:12:48,477
Out my way!

159
00:12:50,062 --> 00:12:51,605
Out me way!

160
00:13:14,169 --> 00:13:16,797
All right there, little fella.
Okay, gotcha.

161
00:13:16,964 --> 00:13:21,343
What did I tell you about the lamp?
My needle was totally knackered.

162
00:13:21,552 --> 00:13:23,804
Rpm's all over the shop.

163
00:13:25,722 --> 00:13:29,142
- Is this the only road in and out?
- If you wanna stay alive.

164
00:13:29,309 --> 00:13:32,437
- Why is that?
- There. That's the jungle, little fella.

165
00:13:32,604 --> 00:13:34,147
You got anacondas in there.

166
00:13:34,314 --> 00:13:37,484
Poison arrow frogs, black flies,
bullet ants.

167
00:13:37,651 --> 00:13:39,736
If they don't get you,
the rebels will.

168
00:13:39,903 --> 00:13:42,531
- What?
- Rebels. That's what I'm telling you.

169
00:13:42,698 --> 00:13:46,368
To them, Cornelius Hatcher's
built a Babylon in paradise.

170
00:13:46,535 --> 00:13:48,996
- Built a what?
- A Babylon.

171
00:13:53,792 --> 00:13:58,130
Yeah, that mine is as close as a man
can come to the gates of hell...

172
00:13:58,630 --> 00:14:00,299
...while his heart's still beating.

173
00:14:06,889 --> 00:14:09,558
The Sunday school picnic is over,
I'll tell you that.

174
00:14:09,725 --> 00:14:11,894
Stay out of the jungle,
little fella, okay?

175
00:14:53,143 --> 00:14:56,688
I found these flowers growing
in the deepest parts of the jungle.

176
00:14:56,855 --> 00:15:00,192
I mean, as far as I can tell,
no one's ever identified them...

177
00:15:00,359 --> 00:15:03,028
...which means I'm responsible
for naming them.

178
00:15:03,237 --> 00:15:07,699
I can only think of one word
that fits something so beautiful.

179
00:15:08,909 --> 00:15:11,203
Mariana.

180
00:15:13,705 --> 00:15:16,166
How much do you want?

181
00:15:16,333 --> 00:15:17,751
- What?
- How much?

182
00:15:17,918 --> 00:15:20,629
I need your uncle's boat.
A day or two, max. Mariana- -

183
00:15:20,838 --> 00:15:23,173
You borrow my car,
bring it back with no windshield.

184
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:25,634
- My brother's scooter- -
- That wasn't my fault.

185
00:15:25,843 --> 00:15:27,761
Now you want to borrow
my uncle's boat?

186
00:15:27,928 --> 00:15:31,265
"I found it, I found it." You'll never
find this Garbo of yours.

187
00:15:31,932 --> 00:15:34,893
- It's "Gato," I told you.
- Gato.

188
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:39,064
It's out there, Mariana.
I know exactly where it is.

189
00:15:39,273 --> 00:15:41,108
But I need that boat.

190
00:15:44,862 --> 00:15:46,822
- How much?
- I told you, l- -

191
00:15:46,989 --> 00:15:48,657
No. How much is your Gato worth?

192
00:15:48,824 --> 00:15:51,118
This is a very significant
academic find.

193
00:15:51,285 --> 00:15:52,995
- How much?
- It's not about money.

194
00:15:53,203 --> 00:15:55,831
- You lie like a little girl, Travis.
- I'm not lying.

195
00:15:56,331 --> 00:16:00,127
If I get the boat for you,
you have to take me with you.

196
00:16:00,294 --> 00:16:02,504
Ridiculous.
We're talking about a boat.

197
00:16:02,671 --> 00:16:06,091
- And we split the take 50- 50.
- I've been doing all the work, okay?

198
00:16:06,258 --> 00:16:09,970
- I found it. No way.
- 50- 50, Travis.

199
00:16:11,847 --> 00:16:13,849
- 70- 30.
- 50- 50.

200
00:16:14,057 --> 00:16:16,685
- 60- 40.
- 50- 50, and I get off work at 6.

201
00:16:16,894 --> 00:16:18,979
Then we can go and get your Gato.

202
00:16:19,521 --> 00:16:21,648
You're evil.

203
00:16:24,484 --> 00:16:26,069
- Thank you.
- Whatever.

204
00:16:26,236 --> 00:16:28,739
For the flowers.

205
00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:54,598
Harvey! We're here
to see your brother.

206
00:16:55,557 --> 00:16:56,600
Where's he from?

207
00:16:56,767 --> 00:16:59,061
- He's an American.
- You got a gun?

208
00:16:59,228 --> 00:17:00,604
No, I don't like guns.

209
00:17:00,771 --> 00:17:02,814
Check him.

210
00:17:08,820 --> 00:17:12,074
- What's the current payout?
- Give me a payout for Quadrant 3.

211
00:17:23,126 --> 00:17:26,922
2425, down 20 percent.

212
00:17:45,816 --> 00:17:47,025
Checked him?

213
00:17:47,192 --> 00:17:48,944
All right, let's go.

214
00:17:49,152 --> 00:17:50,612
Come on.

215
00:17:50,863 --> 00:17:52,823
Come on.

216
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:56,285
I never met an American
who didn't like guns.

217
00:18:03,167 --> 00:18:05,669
Tell them to dig harder.

218
00:18:06,170 --> 00:18:09,631
If only it were that simple,
eh, Mr. Beck?

219
00:18:10,632 --> 00:18:13,302
- How do you know my name?
- When a man of your dimensions...

220
00:18:13,510 --> 00:18:16,638
...travels all this way
to visit a place like this...

221
00:18:16,847 --> 00:18:19,016
...it arouses the curiosity.

222
00:18:19,183 --> 00:18:21,268
What can I do for you?

223
00:18:21,435 --> 00:18:23,770
Do you know this man?

224
00:18:25,022 --> 00:18:26,398
Travis Walker.

225
00:18:26,565 --> 00:18:28,567
I let him excavate
around the mine...

226
00:18:28,775 --> 00:18:30,777
...allow him to rent a room
in my town...

227
00:18:30,986 --> 00:18:33,947
...all for a fair 60 percent
of anything he might unearth.

228
00:18:34,156 --> 00:18:36,617
- Where can I find him?
- Follow the bullshit.

229
00:18:36,783 --> 00:18:40,370
- Guy's mouth should be in the circus.
- Brother, please.

230
00:18:40,537 --> 00:18:43,207
- Do you have business with him?
- I do.

231
00:18:43,373 --> 00:18:45,626
What kind of business?
I love business.

232
00:18:45,792 --> 00:18:47,628
- It's personal.
- So...

233
00:18:48,378 --> 00:18:51,548
...why come to me?
- When I'm a guest in a man's house...

234
00:18:51,715 --> 00:18:54,676
...I don't reach into his refrigerator
without permission.

235
00:18:55,719 --> 00:18:57,137
Refrigerator.

236
00:18:57,304 --> 00:18:59,681
I want to show you something,
Mr. Beck, please.

237
00:19:06,730 --> 00:19:10,901
Does that look like
a refrigerator to you?

238
00:19:15,155 --> 00:19:16,990
Looks more like hell.

239
00:19:17,449 --> 00:19:21,912
Where you see hell, I see
a spellbinding sense of purpose.

240
00:19:22,079 --> 00:19:27,501
I see the value of keeping your eye
on the ball.

241
00:19:28,377 --> 00:19:30,671
When a bride slips the ring
on her finger...

242
00:19:30,879 --> 00:19:33,924
...when a businessman lays his hands
on a Rolex...

243
00:19:34,132 --> 00:19:39,721
...when a rapper gets a shiny new
tooth, this is that cost, Mr. Beck.

244
00:19:39,930 --> 00:19:44,726
My horror for their beauty.
My hell for their little slice of heaven.

245
00:19:46,186 --> 00:19:49,398
Somebody's gotta keep his eye
on the ball.

246
00:19:49,565 --> 00:19:51,483
That somebody is me, Mr. Beck.

247
00:19:51,650 --> 00:19:56,697
I am down here every day
keeping my eye on the ball.

248
00:19:56,864 --> 00:19:59,157
That's just a simple fact of life.

249
00:19:59,324 --> 00:20:03,036
And if you're bold enough
to face that cold, hard fact...

250
00:20:04,037 --> 00:20:06,456
...you can make a lot of money.

251
00:20:09,668 --> 00:20:12,754
- What do you want with the kid?
- I've come to take him home.

252
00:20:14,965 --> 00:20:17,759
That'll cost you $ 10,000.

253
00:20:19,553 --> 00:20:22,472
- I need to borrow the jeep.
- Wait a minute, friend.

254
00:20:22,639 --> 00:20:25,309
I'll give you $ 1000.

255
00:20:26,351 --> 00:20:28,437
I'll give you $ 1000.

256
00:20:28,604 --> 00:20:32,566
I need you to take my bag back to
the plane, keep the engine running.

257
00:20:32,733 --> 00:20:34,735
- Can you do that?
- For $ 1000?

258
00:20:34,902 --> 00:20:37,905
- That's right.
- I'll find a way.

259
00:20:41,366 --> 00:20:45,204
Declan. I'm gonna be coming fast.

260
00:21:07,851 --> 00:21:10,145
American?

261
00:21:10,687 --> 00:21:11,855
Yeah.

262
00:21:16,610 --> 00:21:18,445
Where from?

263
00:21:18,612 --> 00:21:21,281
Someplace that's got bartenders.

264
00:21:36,004 --> 00:21:37,714
What can I get you?

265
00:21:41,301 --> 00:21:43,512
I'll take a beer.

266
00:21:44,721 --> 00:21:46,223
Nice flowers.

267
00:21:50,686 --> 00:21:52,813
"The smiling fool."

268
00:21:54,648 --> 00:21:59,027
Back in the States, Brazil nuts
like these go for $ 15 a pound.

269
00:22:00,529 --> 00:22:03,282
Well, those fell off the tree
out back.

270
00:22:03,448 --> 00:22:05,993
And around here,
we don't call them Brazil nuts.

271
00:22:06,618 --> 00:22:09,371
- What do you call them?
- Well, we're in Brazil...

272
00:22:09,538 --> 00:22:11,415
...so we just call them nuts.

273
00:22:13,584 --> 00:22:15,878
- Fair enough.
- What brings you to the Amazon...

274
00:22:16,086 --> 00:22:19,089
...other than the food and drink,
of course?

275
00:22:20,174 --> 00:22:22,718
- I'm looking for a man.
- What's your type?

276
00:22:23,385 --> 00:22:25,012
His name's Travis Walker.

277
00:22:26,138 --> 00:22:29,558
Brown hair. He's in his 20s.
Wears a blue shirt, jeans.

278
00:22:29,725 --> 00:22:32,769
Right now he's got a real
bewildered look on his face.

279
00:22:32,936 --> 00:22:35,439
- Do I know you?
- Name's Beck.

280
00:22:36,273 --> 00:22:39,568
- What can I do for you?
- I need you to make a choice for me.

281
00:22:39,776 --> 00:22:41,361
A choice?

282
00:22:41,528 --> 00:22:44,031
- Option A or option B.
- What's option A?

283
00:22:44,239 --> 00:22:47,075
Option A is, you and I
walk out of here nice and easy...

284
00:22:47,242 --> 00:22:49,203
...and drive back to the airstrip.

285
00:22:49,453 --> 00:22:52,789
And then we begin our long journey
back to Los Angeles.

286
00:22:52,956 --> 00:22:55,918
There'll be no blood,
no broken bones...

287
00:22:56,710 --> 00:22:59,087
...and no problems.

288
00:22:59,254 --> 00:23:02,341
- What's in Los Angeles?
- Your father.

289
00:23:07,012 --> 00:23:11,016
- What's option B?
- Pretty much the opposite of A.

290
00:23:12,476 --> 00:23:14,978
But I wouldn't recommend that one.

291
00:23:15,145 --> 00:23:17,773
I'll take option C.

292
00:23:17,981 --> 00:23:21,527
Travis, there is no option C.

293
00:23:21,693 --> 00:23:23,195
Really?

294
00:23:25,447 --> 00:23:27,074
Are you sure?

295
00:23:27,533 --> 00:23:32,538
I mean, big boy,
there's always an option C.

296
00:23:41,046 --> 00:23:42,297
So angry!

297
00:23:42,464 --> 00:23:43,924
- Shut up.
- Shut up!

298
00:23:46,635 --> 00:23:49,012
Like I said,
there is no option C.

299
00:23:53,892 --> 00:23:57,563
- Let me introduce you to option C.
- Mr. Beck...

300
00:24:01,275 --> 00:24:03,694
...there's been a slight change
in the narrative.

301
00:24:03,861 --> 00:24:07,614
- An unexpected twist, you might say.
- Can I have a beer, please?

302
00:24:09,032 --> 00:24:12,161
Mr. Hatcher, I was just gonna
come find you when this- -

303
00:24:12,369 --> 00:24:14,580
The kid stays.

304
00:24:14,746 --> 00:24:16,540
- I paid you.
- Well, fortunately...

305
00:24:16,707 --> 00:24:18,834
...I had my fingers crossed
the whole time.

306
00:24:19,042 --> 00:24:21,253
Apparently, young Mr. Walker...

307
00:24:21,420 --> 00:24:23,672
...may have stumbled
onto a trinket of value.

308
00:24:23,881 --> 00:24:27,718
And as he's located it
in my jungle...

309
00:24:28,218 --> 00:24:31,013
...I'm gonna need him
to lead me to it.

310
00:24:38,812 --> 00:24:40,480
Okay, so let's go, dickhead.

311
00:24:40,856 --> 00:24:42,816
Don't call me a dickhead,
you dickhead.

312
00:24:42,983 --> 00:24:45,611
- Did you find it or not, asshole?
- What, asshole?

313
00:24:45,777 --> 00:24:47,779
- Did you find it or not?
- What's that?

314
00:24:47,946 --> 00:24:50,449
- Did you find it or not, asshole?
- Don't!

315
00:24:50,616 --> 00:24:52,534
Hey, don't rock the boat.

316
00:24:56,872 --> 00:24:58,749
Okay.

317
00:25:00,626 --> 00:25:03,545
- I don't want any trouble.
- Leave now. Don't come back.

318
00:25:03,754 --> 00:25:06,548
- And the 10,000?
- Consider it tax deductible.

319
00:25:06,757 --> 00:25:09,676
A contribution
to your personal health fund.

320
00:25:09,843 --> 00:25:12,221
With all due respect, Mr. Hatcher...

321
00:25:12,513 --> 00:25:15,057
...I'm feeling pretty healthy.
- Oh, yeah?

322
00:25:15,265 --> 00:25:16,558
Walk.

323
00:25:18,769 --> 00:25:20,729
Don't make waves.

324
00:26:04,648 --> 00:26:06,692
You're gonna kill us all, Mr. Beck?

325
00:26:21,874 --> 00:26:23,333
I tried to be reasonable.

326
00:26:25,669 --> 00:26:27,421
That's not the way to do business.

327
00:26:35,804 --> 00:26:37,556
You should've kept the gun.

328
00:26:52,821 --> 00:26:56,074
You're dead already.
You just don't know it yet.

329
00:26:56,742 --> 00:26:56,909
This is option B?
Are you kidding me?

330
00:26:56,909 --> 00:26:59,286
This is option B?
Are you kidding me?

331
00:26:59,453 --> 00:27:00,746
Quiet.

332
00:27:00,913 --> 00:27:03,123
You're dead. You're so dead.

333
00:27:05,250 --> 00:27:08,378
We won't get out of here.
All this land, Hatcher owns it.

334
00:27:08,545 --> 00:27:11,173
The road, the air,
Hatcher owns it all.

335
00:27:11,381 --> 00:27:13,592
- Shut up.
- Whatever my dad is paying you...

336
00:27:13,759 --> 00:27:15,093
...I will double it.
- No.

337
00:27:15,260 --> 00:27:16,595
- I'll quadruple it.
- No.

338
00:27:16,803 --> 00:27:18,347
- Double it and quadruple it.
- No.

339
00:27:18,555 --> 00:27:19,848
You're being unreasonable!

340
00:27:21,850 --> 00:27:25,687
- I'll give you a chance to reconsider.
- You get one more chance to shut up.

341
00:27:25,854 --> 00:27:28,190
Is that your final answer?

342
00:27:30,734 --> 00:27:33,529
For what it's worth,
I hope you enjoy the fall.

343
00:27:33,695 --> 00:27:35,322
- Yeah, what fall?
- This fall.

344
00:29:07,998 --> 00:29:10,375
Come on, big boy,
where's the frigging keys?

345
00:29:11,293 --> 00:29:12,961
All right.

346
00:29:25,807 --> 00:29:27,392
Travis?

347
00:29:28,977 --> 00:29:30,187
Good God!

348
00:29:33,607 --> 00:29:34,983
Travis!

349
00:29:39,822 --> 00:29:42,783
- I'm not going back.
- Oh, you're going back.

350
00:29:42,991 --> 00:29:44,326
No way.

351
00:29:44,493 --> 00:29:48,288
- Right now.
- Who the hell do you think you are?

352
00:29:48,455 --> 00:29:52,751
You come into my town,
mess up my bar...

353
00:29:52,918 --> 00:29:55,671
...and you eyeball my woman?
- Eyeball your woman?

354
00:29:56,421 --> 00:29:57,673
It's on.

355
00:29:59,550 --> 00:30:01,635
What's this?

356
00:30:01,802 --> 00:30:04,638
Who is this? Is he your friend?
Do you know him?

357
00:30:04,847 --> 00:30:07,140
Do you? Say hello.

358
00:30:07,307 --> 00:30:10,018
Say hello. Say hello.

359
00:30:17,901 --> 00:30:20,237
Are you finished?
Let's go.

360
00:30:21,738 --> 00:30:25,242
Big boy, you like thunderstorms?

361
00:30:25,742 --> 00:30:27,327
Bet you do, right?

362
00:30:28,662 --> 00:30:30,038
- Little thunder?
- Stop it.

363
00:30:30,205 --> 00:30:31,415
- Little lightning?
- Stop!

364
00:30:31,582 --> 00:30:34,001
Thunder? Lightning?
Thunder? Lightning? Ears- -

365
00:30:36,753 --> 00:30:38,547
You done beating me up?
Let's go.

366
00:30:38,922 --> 00:30:40,549
- I'm tired of this.
- You win.

367
00:30:45,262 --> 00:30:47,014
Come on! Go to sleep.

368
00:30:47,181 --> 00:30:50,058
Go to sleep. Night- night.

369
00:30:50,309 --> 00:30:53,812
Night- night. Go to sleep now!
Come on!

370
00:31:01,737 --> 00:31:04,490
Obviously, we got off
on the wrong foot here.

371
00:31:04,656 --> 00:31:07,868
So I'm gonna be completely
candid with you.

372
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:10,537
Have you ever heard
of the Gato do Diabo?

373
00:31:10,746 --> 00:31:13,707
- The Devil's Cat?
- You're gonna stop speaking now.

374
00:31:13,916 --> 00:31:15,250
All right. It's- -

375
00:31:16,793 --> 00:31:18,754
It's a priceless object, man.

376
00:31:19,713 --> 00:31:22,132
Forged out of pure gold.

377
00:31:22,299 --> 00:31:24,176
- Worth millions.
- You said priceless.

378
00:31:24,343 --> 00:31:27,304
You do not want to argue semantics
with a Ph.D. Candidate.

379
00:31:27,471 --> 00:31:28,931
- Ph.D.?
- Yeah.

380
00:31:30,807 --> 00:31:33,268
I am really very close
to being Dr. Travis Walker.

381
00:31:33,477 --> 00:31:36,730
You dropped out of Stanford
after two semesters, Einstein.

382
00:31:38,023 --> 00:31:40,150
So I'm fairly close.
Closer than you.

383
00:31:40,317 --> 00:31:42,486
Close to getting your ass
kicked again.

384
00:31:42,653 --> 00:31:45,614
Wait, wait, wait!
The Gato is real, all right?

385
00:31:45,781 --> 00:31:47,241
I know where to find it.

386
00:31:47,449 --> 00:31:49,618
- I'll split it with you, 80- 20.
- Move!

387
00:31:50,077 --> 00:31:51,954
70- 30?

388
00:31:53,247 --> 00:31:56,625
You're a very unpleasant individual,
you know that?

389
00:32:22,442 --> 00:32:24,111
You think they're dead?

390
00:32:24,278 --> 00:32:26,655
What am I, psychic?

391
00:32:26,822 --> 00:32:29,658
I'm gonna cut that kid's nose off.

392
00:32:33,036 --> 00:32:34,329
No, Harvey.

393
00:32:34,496 --> 00:32:37,124
You want the Gato
because if the bad guys get it...

394
00:32:37,291 --> 00:32:39,293
...they won't need us anymore.

395
00:32:39,501 --> 00:32:43,130
There'll be no one to work the mine.
You want to work the mine?

396
00:32:51,889 --> 00:32:55,475
There are two men in that jungle
who are trying to steal from me.

397
00:32:55,684 --> 00:32:59,646
I feel like a little boy
who's lost his first tooth...

398
00:32:59,897 --> 00:33:04,401
...put it under his pillow,
waiting for the tooth fairy to come.

399
00:33:04,568 --> 00:33:09,573
Only, two evil burglars
have crept in my window...

400
00:33:09,740 --> 00:33:13,368
...and snatched it
before she could get here.

401
00:33:15,537 --> 00:33:21,084
Wait a second. Do you understand
the concept of the tooth fairy?

402
00:33:27,466 --> 00:33:28,967
Explain it to them.

403
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:32,387
You find a tooth,
you put it under your pillow.

404
00:33:33,472 --> 00:33:35,557
The fairy comes...

405
00:33:36,099 --> 00:33:38,060
...waiting for the tooth.

406
00:33:38,936 --> 00:33:42,064
Wait. She takes the goddamn thing,
gives you a quarter!

407
00:33:42,272 --> 00:33:44,191
They got my tooth!

408
00:33:44,775 --> 00:33:46,652
I want it back.

409
00:34:01,583 --> 00:34:05,546
I have to ask you,
back at the bar, man. That was crazy!

410
00:34:05,754 --> 00:34:07,548
No guns. Strip, toss, toss, strip.

411
00:34:07,714 --> 00:34:10,634
- Didn't I tell you to be quiet?
- I know, but what is that?

412
00:34:10,801 --> 00:34:15,264
Some kind of nouveau samurai code?
You got a problem with guns?

413
00:34:15,430 --> 00:34:17,766
They take me to a place
I don't wanna go.

414
00:34:17,933 --> 00:34:19,184
Where do they take you?

415
00:34:19,810 --> 00:34:22,604
To a place you
don't wanna see me go. Walk!

416
00:34:24,940 --> 00:34:27,025
How often do you work out?

417
00:34:32,447 --> 00:34:33,782
Let me get this straight.

418
00:34:33,949 --> 00:34:35,701
- You never use guns?
- No.

419
00:34:35,868 --> 00:34:37,661
- Never?
- Never.

420
00:34:37,828 --> 00:34:39,913
What if your best friend
was gonna die?

421
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:41,331
No guns.

422
00:34:41,498 --> 00:34:43,625
Santa would do it
to save his best friend.

423
00:34:43,792 --> 00:34:45,127
Do I look like Santa Claus?

424
00:34:45,627 --> 00:34:48,088
- Do I look like Santa Claus to you?
- What is it?

425
00:34:48,255 --> 00:34:51,258
Guns make you um pouco louco?
Bang- bang crazy?

426
00:34:51,466 --> 00:34:54,136
I pick up guns, bad things happen.
I don't like that.

427
00:34:54,303 --> 00:34:57,306
- What kind of things?
- Very bad things, Travis. Walk.

428
00:34:58,348 --> 00:35:00,726
- What about knives?
- Move!

429
00:35:01,351 --> 00:35:03,437
My father doesn't share
the same distaste.

430
00:35:03,645 --> 00:35:06,607
- He's your father. He won't kill you.
- All he cares about...

431
00:35:06,857 --> 00:35:10,110
...is what's good for business.
Now, the question is, Mr. Beck...

432
00:35:10,277 --> 00:35:12,154
...what's good for your business?

433
00:35:12,446 --> 00:35:14,198
You don't like money?

434
00:35:15,282 --> 00:35:17,284
I don't make deals
with people like you.

435
00:35:18,035 --> 00:35:21,830
- You don't even know me.
- You're like every jackass I take down.

436
00:35:21,997 --> 00:35:25,334
First they try to run, then fight,
then they try to negotiate.

437
00:35:25,501 --> 00:35:29,546
When that fails, they do what you're
about to do when you realize it's over.

438
00:35:29,713 --> 00:35:31,381
Oh, yeah? What's that?

439
00:35:31,548 --> 00:35:35,093
You're gonna get down on your hands
and knees and beg me for a break.

440
00:35:35,260 --> 00:35:38,055
Well, guess what.
I don't give breaks.

441
00:35:38,388 --> 00:35:39,681
No breaks.

442
00:35:40,974 --> 00:35:42,726
You don't understand the situation.

443
00:35:42,893 --> 00:35:44,895
You borrowed money
from the wrong guy.

444
00:35:45,062 --> 00:35:49,191
You slept with the wrong guy's wife.
I don't care.

445
00:35:49,942 --> 00:35:51,527
Your mistake.

446
00:35:52,027 --> 00:35:55,864
What about you, Mr. Beck?
Haven't you ever made a mistake?

447
00:35:57,658 --> 00:35:59,827
I know! Move.

448
00:36:02,204 --> 00:36:05,374
No breaks. That's lame.

449
00:36:05,541 --> 00:36:08,961
No breaks!
No, I don't give breaks.

450
00:36:09,127 --> 00:36:12,047
Santa Claus doesn't give
any breaks.

451
00:36:31,650 --> 00:36:34,736
- Should've been at the airstrip by now.
- Like I'm gonna help.

452
00:36:34,903 --> 00:36:36,738
I didn't ask for your help.

453
00:36:40,784 --> 00:36:43,162
- What are you doing?
- I have to pee.

454
00:36:43,328 --> 00:36:45,164
- Pee in your pants. Move.
- No.

455
00:36:45,581 --> 00:36:49,001
I've let you push me around
this jungle for, like, five hours.

456
00:36:49,209 --> 00:36:53,046
You've been very aggressive, and I'm
not moving until you let me pee.

457
00:36:53,213 --> 00:36:56,842
If you wanna keep going, you'll have
to carry me. I'll pee on your head.

458
00:36:57,009 --> 00:36:59,720
You threatening me?
You threatening me with pee?

459
00:36:59,887 --> 00:37:02,264
Well, yeah,
if you don't let me pee here.

460
00:37:03,515 --> 00:37:05,642
Fine. You win.

461
00:37:05,893 --> 00:37:07,436
Pee.

462
00:37:07,853 --> 00:37:09,563
- Will you unzip me?
- No, I won't.

463
00:37:09,730 --> 00:37:13,150
- You wanna pee, you got 30 seconds.
- How can with I my hands cuffed?

464
00:37:13,317 --> 00:37:14,693
Find a way. Pee.

465
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:16,945
Come on.

466
00:37:17,154 --> 00:37:19,156
Don't make it weird.

467
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:24,912
Please?

468
00:37:28,123 --> 00:37:30,209
Don't breathe, don't say a word.

469
00:37:34,004 --> 00:37:36,632
Don't even look at me.
Look over there.

470
00:37:43,180 --> 00:37:44,431
Thanks, man.

471
00:37:49,311 --> 00:37:51,271
Oh, shit.

472
00:37:56,944 --> 00:37:58,779
I can't get it out!

473
00:38:00,030 --> 00:38:02,324
- Could you just help- -?
- No. Hell, no.

474
00:38:12,251 --> 00:38:14,795
Come on! Son of a- -!

475
00:38:15,838 --> 00:38:17,422
Come on, come on!

476
00:38:17,589 --> 00:38:21,134
Come on! Oh, hey. Hey, I got it.

477
00:38:21,301 --> 00:38:24,221
Congratulations.
You got 30 seconds. Hurry up.

478
00:38:25,264 --> 00:38:27,516
Don't listen to Tiny Tim, okay?

479
00:38:27,724 --> 00:38:30,686
You're the real big boy.
Everybody knows it.

480
00:38:30,853 --> 00:38:35,524
Ready? One, two, three, go.

481
00:38:37,401 --> 00:38:39,444
One, two, three, go, go, go, go!

482
00:38:39,611 --> 00:38:40,863
Oh, yeah.

483
00:38:42,072 --> 00:38:43,740
I'm going.

484
00:38:45,868 --> 00:38:47,911
Oh, boy.

485
00:38:56,378 --> 00:38:58,672
What- -? What is this?

486
00:38:58,922 --> 00:39:00,716
What is- -?

487
00:39:00,924 --> 00:39:02,342
Travis! Hey!

488
00:39:03,468 --> 00:39:06,054
Welcome to the jungle, tough guy!

489
00:39:06,263 --> 00:39:08,515
Looks like big boy
got himself pig- snared!

490
00:39:08,682 --> 00:39:11,101
Hey! Hey!
I've got the keys to your cuffs.

491
00:39:12,186 --> 00:39:14,313
- Shit.
- I'll tell you what you've got, pal.

492
00:39:14,521 --> 00:39:18,442
- You've got problems.
- That's- - Don't do it, Travis.

493
00:39:19,902 --> 00:39:23,071
Hey. Hey, get me down. Travis.

494
00:39:23,238 --> 00:39:26,617
Oh, what's this? Is this your diary?
Your little journal?

495
00:39:26,783 --> 00:39:29,578
- Give me that. Don't touch that.
- You want this? Get it!

496
00:39:29,786 --> 00:39:32,664
Come on, get it! Get it! Come on!
Come on! Yeah, yeah!

497
00:39:32,831 --> 00:39:34,458
Oh, yeah, come on! Get it!
Get it!

498
00:39:34,666 --> 00:39:36,043
Give it to me!

499
00:39:36,210 --> 00:39:38,587
You're like a little birdie up there!

500
00:39:41,465 --> 00:39:43,842
I will kill you.
You better give me that book.

501
00:39:44,301 --> 00:39:47,679
"Shrimp and pea risotto
with basil and mint."

502
00:39:47,930 --> 00:39:50,599
- Are you a chef?
- None of your business. Give it back!

503
00:39:50,807 --> 00:39:53,101
Looks like you're
Wolfgang Stuck right here.

504
00:39:53,310 --> 00:39:54,686
Travis! Travis!

505
00:39:54,978 --> 00:39:58,649
- Hey! I let you pee.
- Oh, yeah, you did. You did.

506
00:39:58,815 --> 00:40:00,734
Thank you so much.
Do you have to pee?

507
00:40:00,901 --> 00:40:03,278
Well, you got 30 seconds.
Go ahead and pee.

508
00:40:05,948 --> 00:40:07,324
Oh, shit.

509
00:40:09,785 --> 00:40:13,121
- Hey, I was kidding about what I said.
- Give me the book.

510
00:40:13,330 --> 00:40:16,041
- I don't want it. I don't want it.
- Turn around.

511
00:40:16,458 --> 00:40:18,836
- Why you always gotta hit me?
- Now listen to me.

512
00:40:19,002 --> 00:40:21,463
We gotta get to this tree.
Let's go back to back.

513
00:40:21,630 --> 00:40:23,590
All right. Okay.

514
00:40:24,007 --> 00:40:26,927
- Kick your legs!
- I'm trying! I'm kicking my legs!

515
00:40:27,094 --> 00:40:29,763
- Where are you?
- Grab me. Grab my back, not my ass.

516
00:40:29,930 --> 00:40:31,431
- Got it?
- I got it. Got it.

517
00:40:31,598 --> 00:40:33,308
Oh, great! You did it!

518
00:40:33,517 --> 00:40:35,978
- Now what?
- Put your arm over me. Get to the tree.

519
00:40:36,186 --> 00:40:38,188
- Listen.
- You're like Joe Pig- snare?

520
00:40:38,355 --> 00:40:40,315
Put your arm over me!

521
00:40:41,316 --> 00:40:44,778
- Just stop moving!
- The vine. You gotta grab the- -

522
00:40:46,780 --> 00:40:48,282
What was that?

523
00:40:49,449 --> 00:40:52,161
- Oh, shit.
- What was that?

524
00:40:53,412 --> 00:40:54,705
Monkeys.

525
00:41:00,961 --> 00:41:02,671
Steady.

526
00:41:03,505 --> 00:41:05,299
Steady.

527
00:41:06,383 --> 00:41:08,010
Steady.

528
00:41:08,552 --> 00:41:10,345
Steady.

529
00:41:14,224 --> 00:41:15,642
Steady!

530
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:19,897
Oh, God!

531
00:41:25,402 --> 00:41:27,070
Oh, God!

532
00:41:32,326 --> 00:41:34,244
Do not fight them!

533
00:41:35,621 --> 00:41:37,372
Oh, my God!

534
00:41:39,124 --> 00:41:43,128
- What's he doing? What's he doing?
- He's humping you, he's humping you!

535
00:41:43,295 --> 00:41:45,422
- What's he doing?
- Establish dominance!

536
00:41:45,631 --> 00:41:47,216
Establish dominance!

537
00:41:47,799 --> 00:41:49,718
Get him off of me!

538
00:41:51,637 --> 00:41:54,890
He's humping me!
Make him stop!

539
00:41:55,182 --> 00:41:57,059
The ears! Get the ears.

540
00:42:04,775 --> 00:42:06,652
- Who's that?
- It's the rebels.

541
00:42:06,819 --> 00:42:08,862
Don't worry, they're my friends.

542
00:42:11,532 --> 00:42:13,408
God bless you!

543
00:42:13,575 --> 00:42:15,244
Say hi.

544
00:42:15,619 --> 00:42:16,912
Hi.

545
00:42:38,308 --> 00:42:41,395
These are your friends, huh?
What, are you kidding me?

546
00:42:41,562 --> 00:42:44,273
I'm starting to long for a monkey
with a hard- on.

547
00:42:50,487 --> 00:42:53,907
Whatever happens,
just keep looking into his eyes.

548
00:42:54,158 --> 00:42:55,784
- Won't that offend him?
- No.

549
00:42:56,451 --> 00:42:59,872
Whatever you do, do not blink.
They're like grizzlies.

550
00:43:00,038 --> 00:43:02,207
Just shut up
and let me take care of this.

551
00:43:04,835 --> 00:43:11,133
We know you work for Hatcher.
Were you tracking us?!

552
00:43:11,300 --> 00:43:14,303
- He thinks we work for Hatcher.
- Well, tell him the truth.

553
00:43:14,928 --> 00:43:17,723
Fierce gaze. Fierce gaze.
Fierce gaze.

554
00:43:24,938 --> 00:43:29,902
Honorable host, unlike this man on my
left, I do not work for that evil scum.

555
00:43:32,696 --> 00:43:38,535
Why does the giant stare at me without
respect? I will cut out his arrogant eyes!

556
00:43:38,702 --> 00:43:41,997
- What's he saying?
- Shut up. Just hold his gaze.

557
00:43:43,332 --> 00:43:47,544
He is Hatcher's assassin. Paid to hunt
all who oppose him, including me.

558
00:43:53,467 --> 00:43:56,678
Why do I get the feeling
you really suck at Portuguese?

559
00:43:58,388 --> 00:43:59,640
What did he say?!

560
00:44:00,474 --> 00:44:02,893
He says he pisses on your ancestors...

561
00:44:03,060 --> 00:44:05,771
...and that you would make
a very pretty bride!

562
00:44:09,233 --> 00:44:11,276
- What's going on?
- He wants to fight you.

563
00:44:11,443 --> 00:44:14,404
No. We're not fighting.
Tell him I don't want to fight.

564
00:44:16,240 --> 00:44:20,994
The assassin is a great warrior! Better
to shoot him now and get it over with!

565
00:44:21,161 --> 00:44:24,164
- We are not fighting.
- Don't worry, they're little people.

566
00:44:24,331 --> 00:44:27,084
- What?
- You could take them. They're little.

567
00:44:27,584 --> 00:44:29,378
You can win.

568
00:44:32,005 --> 00:44:33,966
Why do you want to fight? Why?

569
00:44:34,424 --> 00:44:36,385
I just want to get back to the airport.

570
00:44:36,593 --> 00:44:38,887
Please. I just have to get home.

571
00:44:39,429 --> 00:44:41,348
Okay, hip- hop.

572
00:44:51,316 --> 00:44:53,735
I don't want to do this.
Please. Please.

573
00:44:53,944 --> 00:44:57,865
Travis, tell them one more time
I do not want to fight.

574
00:44:58,240 --> 00:45:01,076
I'd love to help you out,
buddy, but I don't think...

575
00:45:01,285 --> 00:45:03,495
...they're really listening
to me anymore.

576
00:45:05,539 --> 00:45:07,040
Heads up.

577
00:45:16,758 --> 00:45:19,428
That's okay! That is okay!

578
00:45:34,276 --> 00:45:36,695
Hey, kansas Cities!

579
00:45:39,406 --> 00:45:40,866
Don't do it.

580
00:45:50,709 --> 00:45:53,670
What is that?
It's like spinning Tarzan jujitsu!

581
00:46:08,852 --> 00:46:11,063
Speedy little bastards, aren't they?

582
00:46:28,580 --> 00:46:30,332
Head's gotta stay up.

583
00:48:06,303 --> 00:48:08,680
I am not your enemy.

584
00:48:18,524 --> 00:48:19,942
Mariana?

585
00:48:32,454 --> 00:48:34,498
What are you doing here?

586
00:48:36,250 --> 00:48:38,919
Barmaid by day,
rebel leader by night.

587
00:48:39,670 --> 00:48:43,799
You are good! The whole time I was
working you, you were working me.

588
00:48:44,007 --> 00:48:46,260
I was hoping you might find
O Gato do Diabo.

589
00:48:46,510 --> 00:48:48,595
It couldn't have all been work.

590
00:48:48,804 --> 00:48:52,724
Could it?
Man, that was some good work.

591
00:48:53,141 --> 00:48:54,977
What do you think, Travis?

592
00:48:55,519 --> 00:48:58,147
I knew. You know that, right?
I totally knew.

593
00:48:58,397 --> 00:49:00,190
Of course.

594
00:49:01,191 --> 00:49:02,818
Hey.

595
00:49:03,443 --> 00:49:06,196
The herbs will keep it
from getting infected.

596
00:49:12,703 --> 00:49:15,455
- Why do you do this?
- Pardon me?

597
00:49:15,831 --> 00:49:20,294
- Why do you fight?
- Because of 65 cents an hour.

598
00:49:20,794 --> 00:49:22,963
That's what Hatcher
pays the workers.

599
00:49:23,130 --> 00:49:25,299
But in order to mine,
you need tools.

600
00:49:25,465 --> 00:49:28,927
You need food, clothing,
a place to sleep.

601
00:49:29,720 --> 00:49:32,264
You have no money,
so, what do you do?

602
00:49:32,472 --> 00:49:34,391
You borrow from Hatcher.

603
00:49:34,892 --> 00:49:38,353
Pick and shovel, a dollar a day.

604
00:49:38,687 --> 00:49:41,148
A sack to haul the dirt,
another dollar.

605
00:49:41,315 --> 00:49:44,735
Old Mr. Beck knows a lot
about debt, don't you?

606
00:49:45,027 --> 00:49:48,363
He knows what it's like to dig a hole
so deep you can't climb out.

607
00:49:48,572 --> 00:49:51,366
Call it what you want.
It's escravidão.

608
00:49:51,575 --> 00:49:52,826
"Slavery."

609
00:49:52,993 --> 00:49:54,995
And we intend to stop it.

610
00:50:04,588 --> 00:50:08,425
Manito wants to know who would win
a fight between Tyson and Ali.

611
00:50:11,303 --> 00:50:12,721
Ali, hands down.

612
00:50:15,390 --> 00:50:17,726
He says, "What about
Tyson's power?"

613
00:50:17,935 --> 00:50:20,270
Shit. Tell him Ali
would've done to Tyson...

614
00:50:20,437 --> 00:50:22,272
...what he did to Foreman in Africa.

615
00:50:23,524 --> 00:50:25,776
Rumble. Rumble in the Jungle.

616
00:50:26,819 --> 00:50:28,362
Tell him Ali was too smart.

617
00:50:29,613 --> 00:50:32,324
Too smart, too fast.
Would've used his jabs. Bam, bam!

618
00:50:33,116 --> 00:50:34,827
Would've danced.

619
00:50:35,118 --> 00:50:36,703
Would've played with his mind.

620
00:50:36,870 --> 00:50:40,457
Before you know it, bam! Left
to the body. Bam! Right to the head.

621
00:50:41,875 --> 00:50:43,293
Down goes Tyson.

622
00:50:44,670 --> 00:50:46,463
Float like butterfly.

623
00:50:47,381 --> 00:50:49,258
Sting like bee.

624
00:50:50,968 --> 00:50:53,971
Float like butterfly, sting like bee.

625
00:50:54,137 --> 00:50:56,557
- Yeah!
- Float like butterfly, sting like a bee!

626
00:50:56,723 --> 00:51:00,894
- Yeah!
- Float like butterfly, sting like a bee!

627
00:51:20,873 --> 00:51:23,667
He says he thinks
you are a great fighter...

628
00:51:24,751 --> 00:51:26,295
...and he wants you to have it.

629
00:51:26,503 --> 00:51:28,755
- It's for luck.
- Tell him I'm sorry, I can't.

630
00:51:28,922 --> 00:51:32,009
You'll offend him if you refuse.

631
00:51:37,306 --> 00:51:39,308
I'm honored. Thank you.

632
00:51:43,353 --> 00:51:45,230
You'll need all the luck you can get.

633
00:51:45,647 --> 00:51:48,317
It's a long walk back to the airfield.

634
00:51:48,775 --> 00:51:50,652
Especially by yourself.

635
00:51:51,320 --> 00:51:52,779
Nice!

636
00:51:52,988 --> 00:51:54,698
You don't understand.

637
00:51:56,158 --> 00:51:58,911
- I'm not going back without him.
- Oh, here we go again.

638
00:51:59,161 --> 00:52:00,496
Fifty rifles say you are.

639
00:52:04,958 --> 00:52:07,544
And we're rebels, not thieves.

640
00:52:15,135 --> 00:52:16,637
Hatcher!

641
00:52:19,306 --> 00:52:21,225
Travis!

642
00:52:40,077 --> 00:52:41,870
Let's clean it up.

643
00:53:08,772 --> 00:53:10,482
Not so fast, jungle boy.

644
00:53:16,280 --> 00:53:17,906
Move! Move!

645
00:53:23,537 --> 00:53:25,038
Come on!

646
00:53:34,506 --> 00:53:36,508
Manito!

647
00:53:38,510 --> 00:53:40,137
Go, go, go!

648
00:53:40,304 --> 00:53:42,014
- Manito!
- Let's go!

649
00:54:02,910 --> 00:54:04,870
I want hunting parties.

650
00:54:05,078 --> 00:54:06,705
Small ones.

651
00:54:06,872 --> 00:54:08,624
Find them.

652
00:54:08,790 --> 00:54:10,709
Find them!

653
00:55:15,482 --> 00:55:17,943
All right, this is the way
it's going to be.

654
00:55:20,070 --> 00:55:23,073
You're going to take me
to O Gato do Diabo.

655
00:55:25,659 --> 00:55:28,162
- And you're going to take me now.
- Calm down.

656
00:55:28,370 --> 00:55:31,957
Don't! You saw what they do.
Don't ever tell me to calm down.

657
00:55:32,124 --> 00:55:34,751
Travis, don't play with me.

658
00:55:34,918 --> 00:55:37,212
- Or what?
- Or I'm going to shoot you.

659
00:55:37,421 --> 00:55:40,382
Well, if you shoot me,
you're never gonna find the Gato.

660
00:55:40,841 --> 00:55:44,261
- So we're gonna make a little deal.
- Deal?

661
00:55:44,511 --> 00:55:48,932
You see? O Gato is an object to you.
It's life on the Riviera, a private yacht.

662
00:55:49,099 --> 00:55:51,768
- You don't know anything about me.
- For us it's hope.

663
00:55:51,935 --> 00:55:54,104
My heart's breaking.
It's like a telethon.

664
00:55:54,271 --> 00:55:56,565
- You selfish- -
- Enough!

665
00:55:56,773 --> 00:55:58,567
Sit down! Sit down!

666
00:55:58,734 --> 00:56:00,569
Holy shit, you tried to shoot me!

667
00:56:02,154 --> 00:56:03,906
You saw it!

668
00:56:04,406 --> 00:56:05,782
- Crazy.
- Shut up.

669
00:56:05,949 --> 00:56:07,576
Shut up.

670
00:56:10,621 --> 00:56:12,706
The deal's this.
He takes you to the Gato.

671
00:56:12,956 --> 00:56:17,377
You just show me how I get out of this
jungle so I can take him home. Deal?

672
00:56:20,464 --> 00:56:23,509
Do we have a deal?

673
00:56:25,010 --> 00:56:28,055
- Deal.
- Let me get this straight.

674
00:56:28,263 --> 00:56:31,225
She gets what she needs,
you get what you need...

675
00:56:31,433 --> 00:56:34,812
...and I get the shaft.
- I could always give her back the gun.

676
00:56:34,978 --> 00:56:38,524
- I really don't like you.
- Yeah, well, I get that a lot.

677
00:56:38,690 --> 00:56:40,192
Seriously.

678
00:57:41,879 --> 00:57:43,338
What?

679
00:57:43,505 --> 00:57:46,466
I was just wondering
how it is you came to do...

680
00:57:46,633 --> 00:57:48,844
...you know, whatever it is you do.

681
00:57:50,888 --> 00:57:53,974
- It's a long story.
- It's a long walk.

682
00:57:55,893 --> 00:57:58,353
I grew up in a very rough place.

683
00:57:59,229 --> 00:58:01,482
One thing led to another, that's all.

684
00:58:02,608 --> 00:58:04,234
- Just like you.
- Like me?

685
00:58:04,401 --> 00:58:06,445
Yeah, you get pushed,
you push back.

686
00:58:06,612 --> 00:58:09,448
Well, with me, I pushed so hard
that word got around.

687
00:58:10,115 --> 00:58:13,160
Before I knew it, I was in a room
full of the wrong people...

688
00:58:13,368 --> 00:58:14,828
...with the wrong money.

689
00:58:15,120 --> 00:58:18,165
So you think I'm standing
in a room full of the wrong people?

690
00:58:18,373 --> 00:58:21,084
Yeah. Something like that.

691
00:58:21,543 --> 00:58:23,962
I like you, Mr. Beck.

692
00:58:24,505 --> 00:58:26,006
Really.

693
00:58:26,924 --> 00:58:29,092
But you and I are nothing alike.

694
00:58:31,428 --> 00:58:32,930
Travis!

695
00:58:33,138 --> 00:58:35,265
Let's keep moving. Let's go.

696
00:59:16,557 --> 00:59:18,267
What are you doing?

697
00:59:19,351 --> 00:59:22,104
Let's take us a little swim,
Wolfgang.

698
00:59:24,606 --> 00:59:26,525
We're not swimming. Let's go.

699
00:59:26,692 --> 00:59:28,610
Come on, big boy.
You could use a bath.

700
00:59:28,819 --> 00:59:31,530
Travis, we have to keep moving.
It'll be dark soon.

701
00:59:33,699 --> 00:59:35,075
Why?

702
00:59:35,242 --> 00:59:37,244
We're already here.

703
00:59:50,340 --> 00:59:51,800
- Don't pee in the water.
- Why?

704
00:59:51,967 --> 00:59:55,679
A candiru, a vicious parasite,
will swim up the urine into your pau.

705
00:59:56,346 --> 00:59:59,433
Come on, big boy! It feels good!

706
01:00:00,809 --> 01:00:03,645
- Swim up my what?
- Your pinto.

707
01:00:04,188 --> 01:00:08,775
It'll swim up your ding- dong. And once
it gets in, you can't get it out.

708
01:00:09,860 --> 01:00:11,278
Come on!

709
01:00:11,445 --> 01:00:13,071
Wait.

710
01:00:13,780 --> 01:00:15,491
Well, then what?

711
01:00:15,782 --> 01:00:17,576
They have to amputate.

712
01:00:26,960 --> 01:00:30,339
Not this boy's pinto. Not today.

713
01:00:56,073 --> 01:00:57,783
The hieroglyphic code...

714
01:00:57,950 --> 01:01:01,370
...said the great chief of the Marajó
people put the Gato to sleep...

715
01:01:01,537 --> 01:01:05,040
...behind walls of a moving curtain.
- A waterfall.

716
01:01:25,477 --> 01:01:27,688
Must be some kind of
methane buildup.

717
01:01:32,568 --> 01:01:34,570
It's cool. Let's go.

718
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:51,253
- Oh, God!
- Yeah, real genius.

719
01:01:51,461 --> 01:01:53,964
- You have no clue what you're doing.
- Oh, shut up!

720
01:01:54,173 --> 01:01:57,050
You obviously don't know
anything about methane deposits.

721
01:01:57,217 --> 01:01:59,970
- Oh, and you do?
- Shut up.

722
01:02:00,637 --> 01:02:02,472
What'd you just say?

723
01:02:34,505 --> 01:02:36,256
What is it?

724
01:02:43,222 --> 01:02:46,141
Why do I get the feeling
we are not supposed to be here?

725
01:02:47,309 --> 01:02:49,144
Because we're not.

726
01:02:59,363 --> 01:03:01,156
There it is! I told you it was real!

727
01:03:01,323 --> 01:03:04,785
Travis, you're never gonna get
back there. It's too dangerous.

728
01:03:08,121 --> 01:03:09,498
The roof is coming down!

729
01:03:09,998 --> 01:03:11,667
Wait a second.

730
01:03:13,627 --> 01:03:15,379
A jaguar.

731
01:03:18,423 --> 01:03:19,800
I know what this is.

732
01:03:19,967 --> 01:03:21,552
Monkey.

733
01:03:22,177 --> 01:03:23,804
Eagle.

734
01:03:24,012 --> 01:03:26,431
- I can't hold this, Travis.
- I know what this is.

735
01:03:26,598 --> 01:03:29,059
- What is it?
- It's an 800- year- old safe.

736
01:03:29,268 --> 01:03:31,728
This is how they kept
their treasures protected.

737
01:03:33,689 --> 01:03:35,065
There's a combination.

738
01:03:36,900 --> 01:03:40,988
Jaguar, cat. Gato, cat.
It's gotta be the jaguar.

739
01:03:41,155 --> 01:03:44,324
We pull the sticks closest
to the jaguar, we'll be okay.

740
01:03:44,491 --> 01:03:46,702
For 60 seconds,
then the roof's coming down.

741
01:03:46,869 --> 01:03:48,996
You're not gonna touch anything.
Let's go!

742
01:03:52,791 --> 01:03:54,459
All right.

743
01:03:56,712 --> 01:03:58,589
Follow the jag.

744
01:03:58,839 --> 01:04:00,591
Follow the jaguar.

745
01:04:07,264 --> 01:04:10,017
Easy. Easy.

746
01:04:11,977 --> 01:04:13,562
It's coming down, Travis.

747
01:04:20,068 --> 01:04:22,070
What are you doing?
Let's go!

748
01:04:22,905 --> 01:04:24,323
Pass it to me.

749
01:04:30,245 --> 01:04:32,372
- Is that a jaguar?
- I think it's an eagle!

750
01:04:32,623 --> 01:04:34,249
Travis, hurry!

751
01:04:37,252 --> 01:04:39,171
Oh, my...

752
01:04:45,177 --> 01:04:47,513
Here, kitty, kitty, kitty.

753
01:04:55,103 --> 01:04:56,730
I did it.

754
01:04:57,272 --> 01:04:58,982
I found you.

755
01:04:59,691 --> 01:05:03,362
Not some Oxford archaeologist
or some stiff- ass Harvard professor.

756
01:05:03,529 --> 01:05:06,323
- I did it! I found you!
- Who gives a shit?

757
01:05:06,532 --> 01:05:08,867
How you like me now, huh, Beck?

758
01:05:11,745 --> 01:05:13,247
Go! Go! Move! Now!

759
01:05:13,789 --> 01:05:15,415
Run!

760
01:05:18,252 --> 01:05:19,920
Let's go!

761
01:05:20,087 --> 01:05:21,296
Move!

762
01:05:36,520 --> 01:05:38,647
These are konlabos.

763
01:05:39,314 --> 01:05:40,983
They're very rare.

764
01:05:41,191 --> 01:05:42,401
You're lucky.

765
01:05:48,365 --> 01:05:51,952
And I wouldn't flirt with O Gato
do Diabo's eyes if I were you.

766
01:05:52,119 --> 01:05:54,621
- They say it's dangerous.
- What else do they say?

767
01:05:54,830 --> 01:05:58,500
Once restored to its rightful owners,
the rivers will be laden with fish.

768
01:05:58,709 --> 01:06:01,670
And the trees will grow tall,
bringing shade for hammocks...

769
01:06:01,837 --> 01:06:03,797
...so its people may rest their backs.

770
01:06:03,964 --> 01:06:06,466
You think bringing this Gato
will do all that?

771
01:06:06,675 --> 01:06:10,512
No, Mr. Beck. But I expect the money
selling it brings will do just that.

772
01:06:10,679 --> 01:06:14,433
We can buy seed, irrigate.
Farm our own lands.

773
01:06:14,641 --> 01:06:16,685
Free ourselves from Hatcher's mine.

774
01:06:18,770 --> 01:06:21,857
When that statue hits the black
market, it'll vanish forever.

775
01:06:22,024 --> 01:06:23,650
It's a little late for morals.

776
01:06:23,859 --> 01:06:26,612
Especially after you were going
to do the same thing.

777
01:06:26,778 --> 01:06:29,823
And 10 percent of that is going
to pay for your freedom...

778
01:06:30,032 --> 01:06:33,118
...so I'd be a little more grateful
if I were you.

779
01:06:34,536 --> 01:06:37,539
What if I told you I was gonna
give it to a museum...

780
01:06:37,706 --> 01:06:39,791
...so the whole world
could appreciate it?

781
01:06:40,209 --> 01:06:44,505
You can tell me anything you want,
Travis, but I know you.

782
01:06:50,385 --> 01:06:52,846
What are you going to do
after you bring him home?

783
01:06:53,055 --> 01:06:56,850
- I'm gonna open a restaurant.
- Yeah. He's a killer in the kitchen too.

784
01:06:57,017 --> 01:06:59,394
Ten, 15 tables. Nothing fancy.

785
01:07:00,312 --> 01:07:03,565
Italian. Southern Italian.

786
01:07:24,211 --> 01:07:26,171
How do you...?

787
01:07:28,882 --> 01:07:32,219
How do you...? How do you spell...

788
01:07:33,804 --> 01:07:35,722
...konlabos?

789
01:07:37,266 --> 01:07:40,602
Konlabos, with a k.

790
01:07:41,061 --> 01:07:45,190
Don't worry. After four or five hours,
you'll be as good as new.

791
01:07:48,443 --> 01:07:51,488
The fire will keep the animals away
until sunup.

792
01:07:53,949 --> 01:07:55,576
I'm sorry...

793
01:07:55,784 --> 01:07:58,745
...but money has a way
of changing people.

794
01:07:59,454 --> 01:08:00,873
You did find it, Travis.

795
01:08:01,707 --> 01:08:03,834
Just like you said.

796
01:08:05,127 --> 01:08:07,754
No one can take that
away from you.

797
01:08:15,470 --> 01:08:17,306
And I will send you the money...

798
01:08:17,473 --> 01:08:19,224
...buy your freedom. I meant that.

799
01:08:23,020 --> 01:08:25,898
You kept your word,
and I admire that...

800
01:08:26,231 --> 01:08:28,150
...so I'll keep mine.

801
01:08:28,317 --> 01:08:30,402
Go north until you reach
the Quantana Road.

802
01:08:30,611 --> 01:08:33,113
Take it south
all the way to the airfield.

803
01:08:33,322 --> 01:08:35,240
Good luck to you, Mr. Beck.

804
01:09:39,429 --> 01:09:40,889
Oh, shit.

805
01:09:41,098 --> 01:09:43,559
What? What?

806
01:09:48,730 --> 01:09:51,692
- What?
- Monkey. Monkey.

807
01:09:51,859 --> 01:09:53,902
Monkey? Where?
Just get him away from me.

808
01:09:54,069 --> 01:09:56,572
- Get out of here.
- Get out of here.

809
01:09:56,738 --> 01:09:58,574
Get out of here, monkey!

810
01:09:59,992 --> 01:10:01,910
Oh, no.

811
01:10:02,077 --> 01:10:04,163
- I hate this place.
- Get out of here!

812
01:10:04,329 --> 01:10:08,625
I hate penis- eating minnows,
and I hate freaky fruit.

813
01:10:09,793 --> 01:10:13,130
- Get them away from me.
- I wanna go home. I want concrete.

814
01:10:13,297 --> 01:10:16,758
- Get out of here, monkey.
- I want homemade tortellini.

815
01:10:16,967 --> 01:10:19,261
I want my Los Angeles Lakers.

816
01:10:19,595 --> 01:10:23,056
That's what I want. I want to go home.
I want to go home.

817
01:10:24,099 --> 01:10:27,060
I want to go home!

818
01:10:28,103 --> 01:10:31,273
Get out of here, monkey.
Get out of here, monkey.

819
01:10:50,375 --> 01:10:52,503
Well, what about that?

820
01:10:56,298 --> 01:10:59,092
- Been for a stroll, have you, boys?
- Where's my bag?

821
01:10:59,259 --> 01:11:01,303
Where's my jeep?

822
01:11:01,470 --> 01:11:03,472
Give me my bag.

823
01:11:13,065 --> 01:11:14,525
You have any water?

824
01:11:22,991 --> 01:11:26,286
Sit down. How soon
before we can take off?

825
01:11:26,453 --> 01:11:29,122
You left a jeep at the bottom
of a mountainside.

826
01:11:29,289 --> 01:11:31,750
- I'll take care of it.
- In a bloody large puddle.

827
01:11:31,917 --> 01:11:35,379
- I said, I'll take care of it.
- That jeep is dead, my friend.

828
01:11:35,921 --> 01:11:37,631
Look, you'll get your money.

829
01:11:37,798 --> 01:11:40,092
- Just start the plane.
- What's your big hurry?

830
01:11:40,259 --> 01:11:43,512
I'm trying to leave before I run
into Hatcher or more problems.

831
01:11:43,679 --> 01:11:45,389
Don't go worrying about Hatcher.

832
01:11:45,848 --> 01:11:48,809
That monstrosity
won't give a flying fornication...

833
01:11:49,017 --> 01:11:52,020
...for the pair of youse no more.
He got what he was after.

834
01:11:52,187 --> 01:11:53,730
What do you mean?

835
01:11:53,939 --> 01:11:56,525
He caught up with poor Mariana
in the jungle.

836
01:11:56,692 --> 01:11:58,777
He relieved her of her artifact.

837
01:11:59,486 --> 01:12:03,949
- What'd you say?
- I said, he relieved her of her artifact.

838
01:12:04,116 --> 01:12:07,202
It's a word in the English language.
"Artifact." Look it up.

839
01:12:07,369 --> 01:12:10,706
Son of a bitch. He's got my Gato!

840
01:12:10,873 --> 01:12:14,835
- Your what?
- The Gato. Don't you speak English?

841
01:12:15,544 --> 01:12:18,380
- Hey. Where is she?
- Hatcher's got her in town.

842
01:12:18,630 --> 01:12:21,508
- He's torturing her for information.
- He's doing what?

843
01:12:23,552 --> 01:12:25,888
Freedom fighters?
Freedom fighters, my ass.

844
01:12:26,054 --> 01:12:29,057
Lutadores de Louco, you ask me.

845
01:12:29,224 --> 01:12:31,351
They're all gonna die.

846
01:12:31,518 --> 01:12:33,520
Come on. All aboard.

847
01:13:04,593 --> 01:13:06,220
Come on.

848
01:13:07,054 --> 01:13:08,889
What are you doing?

849
01:13:11,809 --> 01:13:14,895
- We made a deal.
- A deal?

850
01:13:16,021 --> 01:13:17,689
What the hell does that mean?

851
01:13:17,856 --> 01:13:20,442
I'm here at the airstrip,
she doesn't have the Gato.

852
01:13:20,818 --> 01:13:22,778
Gonna go in there by yourself?

853
01:13:24,363 --> 01:13:27,074
No way. No way.

854
01:13:27,282 --> 01:13:29,368
Hey, Hatcher's got a small army
back there.

855
01:13:29,576 --> 01:13:31,537
You don't know your way
around the town.

856
01:13:31,745 --> 01:13:33,247
Oh, wait. I got an idea.

857
01:13:33,580 --> 01:13:35,457
Saddle up to one of those bulls...

858
01:13:35,624 --> 01:13:40,128
...ride into town like a conquistador
and challenge all of them to a duel.

859
01:13:40,420 --> 01:13:43,340
Oh, yeah. I forgot.

860
01:13:43,507 --> 01:13:45,592
You don't use guns.

861
01:13:45,759 --> 01:13:48,220
- What's your point?
- You're gonna die, Beck.

862
01:13:48,387 --> 01:13:51,265
The boy's right.
You mind if we settle the bill now?

863
01:13:51,431 --> 01:13:52,933
You need help.

864
01:13:53,100 --> 01:13:56,270
Are you gonna help me, Travis?
All you care about is the money.

865
01:13:56,436 --> 01:13:58,105
No, Beck, you're wrong.

866
01:13:58,313 --> 01:14:01,441
I'd rather die than let that
son of a bitch get my Gato.

867
01:14:01,650 --> 01:14:05,445
You need all the help you can get.
You can even use him, for chrissake.

868
01:14:05,612 --> 01:14:08,490
Don't bring me into it.
I got a dodgy knee here.

869
01:14:10,159 --> 01:14:12,661
You can't do this on your own.

870
01:14:21,420 --> 01:14:23,672
Okay, Travis.

871
01:14:25,007 --> 01:14:27,050
I know you're gonna run on me.

872
01:14:27,217 --> 01:14:29,136
Might not be tonight or tomorrow.

873
01:14:29,470 --> 01:14:33,182
But I will find you,
and I will take you back.

874
01:14:34,725 --> 01:14:37,311
- Are we clear?
- Yeah.

875
01:14:37,519 --> 01:14:40,522
We'll both probably be dead
in about an hour.

876
01:14:40,689 --> 01:14:42,649
So let's cancel Christmas.

877
01:14:52,868 --> 01:14:55,496
Your plan of attack was a bit naive.

878
01:14:56,538 --> 01:14:58,999
Man, if I was only
10 minutes younger, huh?

879
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:03,712
I suppose now we have a conversation
where you enlighten me.

880
01:15:03,879 --> 01:15:05,088
Mr. Hatcher.

881
01:15:05,297 --> 01:15:08,300
How many more of you are out there?
Enlighten me.

882
01:15:08,509 --> 01:15:11,011
Where are the rest of your
compadres? Enlighten me!

883
01:15:11,220 --> 01:15:12,429
Mr. Hatcher.

884
01:15:12,596 --> 01:15:15,015
I don't get why you people
are so hostile.

885
01:15:15,182 --> 01:15:17,684
I've been good to you.
I built you a town.

886
01:15:17,851 --> 01:15:19,061
Why are we fighting?

887
01:15:19,228 --> 01:15:20,562
- Mr. Hatcher.
- What?

888
01:15:20,729 --> 01:15:23,690
We've lost contact
with Outpost 1.

889
01:15:25,776 --> 01:15:27,486
There's nobody answering.

890
01:15:32,324 --> 01:15:36,245
- Mr. Hatcher, are you out there?
- What can I do for you, Mr. Beck?

891
01:15:36,411 --> 01:15:38,747
I have no desire to fight
with you or your men.

892
01:15:39,206 --> 01:15:41,124
For that reason,
you have two options.

893
01:15:41,291 --> 01:15:44,336
Option A, you leave the Gato
and the girl...

894
01:15:44,545 --> 01:15:47,047
...and you walk out of town,
no questions asked.

895
01:15:47,256 --> 01:15:50,342
- What's option B?
- Option B...

896
01:15:50,509 --> 01:15:52,302
...I make you.

897
01:16:04,982 --> 01:16:06,900
Wrong choice.

898
01:16:13,240 --> 01:16:15,200
Lock down the town.

899
01:17:18,680 --> 01:17:22,518
Still no visual contact. Team two
is checking the perimeter right now.

900
01:18:07,521 --> 01:18:09,106
He...

901
01:18:09,273 --> 01:18:12,818
...that heard the sound
of thy holy trumpet...

902
01:18:12,985 --> 01:18:15,028
...and took not warning...

903
01:18:15,404 --> 01:18:19,158
...he hath clearly wandered too far...

904
01:18:19,324 --> 01:18:20,951
...from the word of God.

905
01:18:21,243 --> 01:18:24,288
And Cornelius Bernard Hatcher...

906
01:18:24,580 --> 01:18:29,209
...your heir has come.
Let's get it on, big boy!

907
01:18:29,418 --> 01:18:32,963
It's time to get back on the path.

908
01:19:31,897 --> 01:19:33,315
That's a lot of cows.

909
01:19:41,824 --> 01:19:43,242
Hi.

910
01:19:59,299 --> 01:20:00,592
What nerve.

911
01:20:24,867 --> 01:20:26,201
About bloody time, huh?

912
01:20:30,205 --> 01:20:32,082
Somebody just shoot him.

913
01:21:01,153 --> 01:21:03,197
Oh, yeah? Oh, you want one?

914
01:21:04,781 --> 01:21:06,909
Oh, okay.

915
01:21:07,075 --> 01:21:10,996
A little thunder? Huh?
You like thunderstorms, big boy?

916
01:21:11,788 --> 01:21:13,248
How about some lightning?

917
01:21:22,341 --> 01:21:27,054
Ear, ear- - Ears, eyes, foot, face!

918
01:21:33,769 --> 01:21:37,147
Take the Gato and the girl
and get to the airfield.

919
01:21:37,314 --> 01:21:40,108
If you run into trouble,
use her as a hostage.

920
01:21:40,275 --> 01:21:42,945
And Harvey,
when you're safely out of town...

921
01:21:43,111 --> 01:21:45,948
...put her out of my misery.

922
01:22:19,314 --> 01:22:20,649
I need help!

923
01:22:33,036 --> 01:22:35,664
Do not go gentle
into that good night, my lovely.

924
01:22:37,541 --> 01:22:40,210
Beck! I need help. Beck!

925
01:22:40,502 --> 01:22:42,171
Rage, rage...

926
01:22:44,673 --> 01:22:46,508
...against the dying of the light.

927
01:22:50,345 --> 01:22:52,848
There shall be no mercy...

928
01:22:56,185 --> 01:22:58,353
...for any force that stands...

929
01:23:01,690 --> 01:23:04,485
...blocking this path
of his righteousness.

930
01:23:08,655 --> 01:23:10,491
Beck, help!

931
01:23:18,415 --> 01:23:20,834
Help!

932
01:24:00,916 --> 01:24:02,626
Move!

933
01:24:42,624 --> 01:24:44,751
No way.

934
01:24:56,972 --> 01:24:59,183
Give me back my Gato,
you little bald freak!

935
01:25:55,322 --> 01:25:56,573
Oh, great.

936
01:27:43,597 --> 01:27:45,557
See you.

937
01:27:45,724 --> 01:27:47,768
You got the moves.

938
01:27:47,935 --> 01:27:49,311
I'll give you that.

939
01:27:57,736 --> 01:28:02,616
You reached into the wrong
refrigerator, Mr. Beck.

940
01:28:14,253 --> 01:28:16,213
Hold your horses.

941
01:28:16,380 --> 01:28:18,382
What have I done?

942
01:28:19,967 --> 01:28:21,718
Are we not men?

943
01:28:22,636 --> 01:28:24,388
- Hatcher.
- What?

944
01:28:24,555 --> 01:28:28,267
Option A is still on the table.
You can walk away right now.

945
01:28:29,518 --> 01:28:31,937
Option A doesn't work for me.

946
01:28:32,980 --> 01:28:36,984
Before I came here,
what did you people have?

947
01:28:37,359 --> 01:28:38,819
Face it. Be fair.

948
01:28:39,319 --> 01:28:41,947
I put a roof over your head,
coin in your pockets.

949
01:28:42,114 --> 01:28:46,160
You barefoot Indians
didn't have pockets...

950
01:28:46,368 --> 01:28:49,746
...before Hatcher came along.

951
01:28:50,080 --> 01:28:53,667
I gave you a life!
I'm the heart in the darkness.

952
01:28:53,876 --> 01:28:55,460
Face it...

953
01:28:55,627 --> 01:28:58,213
...you can't run this thing
without me.

954
01:28:58,380 --> 01:29:02,301
I am pumping the blood
of the modern world...

955
01:29:02,509 --> 01:29:04,636
...into your backward veins...

956
01:29:04,845 --> 01:29:07,014
...you stinking...

957
01:29:09,057 --> 01:29:10,267
...ingrate...

958
01:29:11,602 --> 01:29:14,104
...Oompa Loompa...

959
01:29:14,271 --> 01:29:16,482
...morons!

960
01:29:20,194 --> 01:29:21,987
Okay.

961
01:29:22,154 --> 01:29:24,114
That's it, I'm done.

962
01:29:31,663 --> 01:29:33,582
Mr. Beck...

963
01:29:35,709 --> 01:29:38,295
...I'll take option A.

964
01:29:40,547 --> 01:29:42,508
Clear, please.

965
01:30:08,158 --> 01:30:09,451
Oh, shit.

966
01:30:24,133 --> 01:30:26,969
You make a hell of an entrance,
Mr. Beck.

967
01:30:28,720 --> 01:30:30,347
Yeah.

968
01:30:35,853 --> 01:30:39,148
I'd offer you a beer,
but I think you blew up my bar.

969
01:30:39,982 --> 01:30:41,942
Yeah, I think you're right.

970
01:30:44,194 --> 01:30:45,779
Thank you.

971
01:30:47,322 --> 01:30:50,450
- We had a deal.
- Yes, we did.

972
01:30:50,826 --> 01:30:53,662
And I'm afraid I didn't deliver
on that deal.

973
01:30:54,371 --> 01:30:56,165
How is that?

974
01:30:58,083 --> 01:31:00,002
The Gato.

975
01:31:00,085 --> 01:31:02,421
I promised you the Gato.

976
01:31:03,297 --> 01:31:05,674
Yes, well, I promised you Travis.

977
01:31:05,841 --> 01:31:08,760
You all talking about this Travis?

978
01:31:09,678 --> 01:31:11,638
And this Gato?

979
01:31:23,692 --> 01:31:24,902
I'm impressed.

980
01:31:25,068 --> 01:31:27,529
Yeah, well, make sure
they spell my name right.

981
01:31:30,324 --> 01:31:32,701
I told you it wasn't about the money.

982
01:31:34,953 --> 01:31:36,705
Well, big boy...

983
01:31:36,872 --> 01:31:38,874
...I guess it's your move.

984
01:31:50,052 --> 01:31:51,929
I'm impressed myself, Travis.

985
01:31:57,017 --> 01:31:59,686
Declan, start the plane.

986
01:32:00,187 --> 01:32:03,565
"Declan, start the plane"?
What does that mean?

987
01:32:03,732 --> 01:32:05,859
- I'm taking you home.
- Oh, I figured that.

988
01:32:06,109 --> 01:32:07,820
No breaks. Good luck.

989
01:32:07,986 --> 01:32:09,613
You too.

990
01:32:10,656 --> 01:32:12,783
I will send you your cut.

991
01:32:13,534 --> 01:32:15,410
Move.

992
01:32:16,745 --> 01:32:20,290
- Not a penny less than 15.6 million.
- Move, Travis.

993
01:32:20,499 --> 01:32:22,459
You really ought
to stay away from guns.

994
01:32:22,668 --> 01:32:26,255
You ought to get yourself
a psychiatrist. Seriously.

995
01:33:18,932 --> 01:33:20,559
Move.

996
01:33:25,439 --> 01:33:27,065
Well, look at him.

997
01:33:27,274 --> 01:33:30,777
Look at you. Your beard.
You're like a real man.

998
01:33:30,986 --> 01:33:33,363
- But you're so thin.
- Running is good exercise.

999
01:33:33,530 --> 01:33:35,949
Good exercise. That's funny.
Did you hear him?

1000
01:33:36,283 --> 01:33:37,534
Running for your life.

1001
01:33:38,827 --> 01:33:40,829
I love it. I really do!

1002
01:33:43,582 --> 01:33:46,168
You know there's not
enough aspirin in the world...

1003
01:33:46,335 --> 01:33:49,046
...for a headache like you?
- Well, there probably is.

1004
01:33:49,213 --> 01:33:51,924
- But I understand what you mean.
- Well, that's good.

1005
01:33:52,090 --> 01:33:56,178
Because that means you'll understand
why you'll take that trip to Chicago.

1006
01:33:56,345 --> 01:33:58,972
Actually, I don't completely
understand that one.

1007
01:33:59,139 --> 01:34:02,142
- Still the smart- ass.
- I'm not that smart, Dad.

1008
01:34:02,351 --> 01:34:05,437
- I didn't know she was married.
- Well, she was.

1009
01:34:06,188 --> 01:34:08,148
Very married.

1010
01:34:08,857 --> 01:34:10,859
And you. What took you
so long, huh?

1011
01:34:11,026 --> 01:34:13,612
Your kid was
a tough rundown, Billy.

1012
01:34:14,196 --> 01:34:17,282
- Him? No.
- Yeah, yeah.

1013
01:34:17,449 --> 01:34:20,786
But I did walk him right through
that door, right? Like we agreed?

1014
01:34:20,953 --> 01:34:22,788
- You did.
- We good?

1015
01:34:24,289 --> 01:34:27,042
We're good.
Two hundred and fifty large.

1016
01:34:27,376 --> 01:34:29,002
You got your restaurant, kid.

1017
01:34:29,628 --> 01:34:31,046
Now get out of here, huh?

1018
01:34:33,757 --> 01:34:34,842
Before I leave...

1019
01:34:35,217 --> 01:34:38,345
When I was in Brazil, they
showed me this ritual they do...

1020
01:34:38,554 --> 01:34:40,305
...when they have big celebrations.

1021
01:34:40,472 --> 01:34:46,395
What they do is, they eat this fruit,
and it's called konlabos, with a k.

1022
01:34:48,188 --> 01:34:52,401
So I figured before I leave,
we could celebrate one last time.

1023
01:34:52,568 --> 01:34:54,403
Come on, guys. Try some of this.

1024
01:34:54,570 --> 01:34:57,739
If he says it's good, it's gotta be.
He's the best chef I know.

1025
01:34:57,906 --> 01:35:00,742
Billy, here, you try the first piece.

1026
01:35:01,827 --> 01:35:03,036
Not bad.

1027
01:35:03,579 --> 01:35:06,999
Big seeds, though.
I don't like seeds.

1028
01:35:10,502 --> 01:35:12,171
Hey, what are you- -?

1029
01:35:30,397 --> 01:35:32,816
I walked him right through
that door, Billy.

1030
01:35:38,113 --> 01:35:39,740
Boy...

1031
01:35:41,450 --> 01:35:43,452
...you got a funny- looking face.

1032
01:35:44,077 --> 01:35:45,787
Hey, Dad.

1033
01:35:49,249 --> 01:35:49,374
I love you, you know that?

1034
01:35:49,374 --> 01:35:50,792
I love you, you know that?

1035
01:35:50,959 --> 01:35:53,170
Because you showed me
something back there.

1036
01:35:53,337 --> 01:35:57,090
I thought you had character,
but I wasn't sure.

1037
01:35:57,257 --> 01:36:00,010
- You got it, man. You really got it!
- Get in the truck.

1038
01:36:00,135 --> 01:36:04,056
- You violated every agricultural law.
- That's the least of my problems.

1039
01:36:04,223 --> 01:36:06,642
We should go back
in there and finish him off.

1040
01:36:06,809 --> 01:36:08,352
You want to go back, go ahead.

1041
01:36:08,519 --> 01:36:11,730
- Knock yourself out. I'll wait for you.
- I'm not going back.

1042
01:36:11,897 --> 01:36:15,901
Right. So shut up, get in the truck
before I change my mind.

1043
01:36:16,109 --> 01:36:17,444
Don't push me.

1044
01:36:18,487 --> 01:36:20,239
- What?
- Don't push me.

1045
01:36:20,405 --> 01:36:22,366
I appreciate everything you did.

1046
01:36:22,574 --> 01:36:26,703
If you want to get technical, all you did
is even the score. I saved you first.

1047
01:36:26,912 --> 01:36:28,747
- Get in.
- You don't have to thank me.

1048
01:36:28,914 --> 01:36:32,125
But this pushing shit ain't
happening no more. You read me?

1049
01:36:35,963 --> 01:36:39,466
Okay. I'm gonna bust you up.

1050
01:36:39,842 --> 01:36:41,635
Go for it.

1051
01:36:42,761 --> 01:36:44,638
Yeah.

1052
01:36:46,390 --> 01:36:49,726
Hey, remember your friend
Mr. Thunder?

1053
01:36:49,935 --> 01:36:52,396
How about his buddy
Mr. Lightning?

1054
01:36:53,730 --> 01:36:56,191
I know you know him.

1055
01:36:56,358 --> 01:36:59,153
You know him real well, don't you?

1056
01:37:10,581 --> 01:37:13,375
I'm just playing, man.
I'll be in the truck.

1057
01:37:17,713 --> 01:37:18,964
I'm gonna kill you.

1058
01:37:19,173 --> 01:37:31,685
