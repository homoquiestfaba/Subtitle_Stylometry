00:00:53,814 --> 00:00:57,284
Welcome to the nightmare.

2
00:00:57,454 --> 00:01:01,003
- Hey Trevor,Let's take a peak in the backpack.
- You have probable cause?
- Yeah your reputation.
- Now let's see the backpack.

3
00:01:38,574 --> 00:01:42,203
- Hey, Trashcan!
- Oh look who!The mad bomber.

4
00:01:42,374 --> 00:01:48,244
- You blow up any schools lately?
- Thanks to you, we have to going through an X-ray every morning.
- If I were you trashcan...
- I wouldn't be caught in the men's room.

5
00:01:48,414 --> 00:01:51,486
- Oh, oh. Excuse me.
- Later, dork...

6
00:01:57,414 --> 00:01:59,325
Congratulation

7
00:01:59,494 --> 00:02:01,883
You're the first casualty of zero tolerance.

8
00:02:02,054 --> 00:02:04,966
Okay, everyone, listen up!
I said, listen up.

9
00:02:05,134 --> 00:02:07,125
Any suspicion of violence

10
00:02:07,294 --> 00:02:09,489
physical or verbal

11
00:02:09,654 --> 00:02:11,645
Will result in immediate suspension

12
00:02:11,814 --> 00:02:15,602
or expulsion.That is zero tolerance!

13
00:02:16,654 --> 00:02:18,610
All rights. Come on,
move on through.

14
00:02:20,774 --> 00:02:24,289
Mr Adams, let's talk in my office
before homeroom?

15
00:02:46,614 --> 00:02:48,366
Morning, Trevor.

16
00:02:49,534 --> 00:02:52,844
- How was your summer?
- Oh, just wonderful.

17
00:02:53,014 --> 00:02:54,732
Trevor, put the camera away,please.

18
00:02:56,214 --> 00:02:58,489
Uh, what made it wonderful?

19
00:03:03,294 --> 00:03:05,330
Well,between counseling

20
00:03:05,494 --> 00:03:09,203
and having to repeat my courses in summer school.

21
00:03:09,374 --> 00:03:11,330
It's a toss-up.

22
00:03:12,094 --> 00:03:13,846
You know Trevor,

23
00:03:14,014 --> 00:03:15,891
a lot of parents called for your expulsion

24
00:03:16,054 --> 00:03:18,170
But, Mr. Olson and others

25
00:03:18,334 --> 00:03:20,450
supported your reinstatement.

26
00:03:22,014 --> 00:03:25,165
If you would be so kind as to provide me with a list of their names.

27
00:03:25,334 --> 00:03:28,326
I'd like to send them tank you cards.

28
00:03:32,854 --> 00:03:34,810
Why are you here, Trevor?

29
00:03:34,974 --> 00:03:37,693
Well,my parents pay taxes which entitles them to

30
00:03:37,854 --> 00:03:40,971
one free public education.

31
00:03:43,254 --> 00:03:46,963
I'd like to continue anger management with you

32
00:03:47,134 --> 00:03:49,250
But it's your call.

33
00:03:49,414 --> 00:03:51,370
you know,maybe i can

34
00:03:51,534 --> 00:03:53,172
help you through the...?

35
00:03:57,534 --> 00:03:59,126
Say hey to him.

36
00:03:59,294 --> 00:04:01,330
- Hell, no, man.He might blow me up.
- He's one of us, man.

37
00:04:01,494 --> 00:04:03,450
He's too cool.

38
00:04:13,854 --> 00:04:17,210
We are going to start with
a broad survey of american literature.

39
00:04:17,374 --> 00:04:22,971
Hawthorne, Poe, Twain, and James.
Pass these back.

40
00:04:24,774 --> 00:04:26,526
Mr. Adams?

41
00:04:28,614 --> 00:04:32,243
"Poe, Twain, James,...
Mr Adams."

42
00:04:33,934 --> 00:04:35,731
I doubt what you're listening to

43
00:04:35,934 --> 00:04:37,447
is going to help you on the sats, Mr. Adams..

44
00:04:38,374 --> 00:04:42,253
- Climb the pyramids,Mr. D?
- Almost pulled my calf muscle halfway up, man.

45
00:04:42,414 --> 00:04:46,487
- You should have gone for it, Mr. D.
Isn't it just a staircase?
- Yeah, and each stair is 1.80 meters hight.

46
00:04:46,654 --> 00:04:48,610
Ho!
That's what I said: "Ho."

47
00:04:48,774 --> 00:04:50,810
Hey, Trevor,wait up!

48
00:04:52,894 --> 00:04:57,126
- Hey.Good to see you again.
- How's it going?
Summer school, bummer school, heh?

49
00:04:57,294 --> 00:05:01,572
Listen, they screw up your schedule?
I got you in my video class, but not in drama.

50
00:05:01,734 --> 00:05:07,286
- Yeah, I'm done with theater.
- Oh. If you change your mind
there's always the drama club, right?

51
00:05:10,814 --> 00:05:13,044
How's the "mad bomber"?

52
00:05:13,254 --> 00:05:14,653
Come on,you know better,
it's just fit.

53
00:05:14,814 --> 00:05:17,886
Oh, yeah, I remember when I went through
that the teenage terrorist phase.

54
00:05:18,054 --> 00:05:22,127
- Downloading the terrorist cookbook.
making bombs, trying to blow up my school
- There was no real bomb

55
00:05:22,294 --> 00:05:26,651
- Yeah, the only thing it didn't has was an explosive.
- Well, he made a mistake. He needs a second chance.

56
00:05:26,814 --> 00:05:31,205
- I look in that kid's eyes.
I swear I can hear him tick.
- Where's your ring?

57
00:05:31,374 --> 00:05:32,887
The engagement's off.

58
00:05:35,134 --> 00:05:38,843
Oh!Oh, it's off.
Ah. Well, I'm,I'm sorry.

59
00:05:39,014 --> 00:05:41,926
Don't drown in your crocodile tears.

60
00:05:49,574 --> 00:05:53,169
- Oh, excuse me?
You can't just sit where you want.
- Why not?

61
00:05:53,334 --> 00:05:54,767
Who are you with?
"With"?

62
00:05:54,934 --> 00:05:59,325
- You have to be a varsity or
a cheerleader to sit at this table.
- Or know everybody.

63
00:05:59,494 --> 00:06:03,123
That table's for the druggies, stoners,
deadheads, burnouts, and the hippies.

64
00:06:03,294 --> 00:06:07,367
That one... preppies.
Then you have the skateboarders
and skateboard chicks.

65
00:06:07,534 --> 00:06:11,925
The nerds and techies.
Up against the wall,the wiggers,hip hoppers, rednecks,
goths

66
00:06:12,094 --> 00:06:17,043
and all manner of freaks,troublemakers, losers, sluts, gays,
floaters

67
00:06:17,214 --> 00:06:19,170
- and the trogs.
- "Trogs"?

68
00:06:19,334 --> 00:06:22,371
Troglodytes?
Freakiest of the freaks!

69
00:06:22,534 --> 00:06:26,652
Where do you sit if you just
want to have lunch?

70
00:06:29,294 --> 00:06:33,651
- Hey,I'm Brad,Do you want to sit with me?
- No, thanks.

71
00:06:39,974 --> 00:06:44,172
- Hey,Good going last year.
- For what?

72
00:06:44,334 --> 00:06:46,723
For standing up to them.

73
00:06:47,734 --> 00:06:50,009
- You want to sit with us?
- No, thanks.

74
00:06:50,174 --> 00:06:52,130
That's cool, man.

75
00:06:59,014 --> 00:07:04,168
- I got this play off the internet.
I really like this play.
- I really want to do this play.

76
00:07:04,334 --> 00:07:07,087
- I want you to play the main character.
- You're joking?
- I'm not joking.

77
00:07:07,254 --> 00:07:11,725
I'm not getting up in front of these people.
Why not?
To give them another reason to trash me?

78
00:07:11,894 --> 00:07:14,408
- Will you at least read the play?
- I don't see the point.

79
00:07:14,574 --> 00:07:20,524
- Hey,uh,What did you want to see me for?
- Hi, Jenny, um,Jenny, Trevor. Trevor, Jenny.
- Hi!

80
00:07:21,654 --> 00:07:26,205
Jenny just moved here from California.
Saw her at some regionals last year...
Awesome, awesome Julliet.

81
00:07:26,374 --> 00:07:29,332
She'll be reading Katie,
the female lead.

82
00:07:31,294 --> 00:07:34,570
- Well,maybe it wouldn't hurt to read it.
- Yeah

83
00:07:34,734 --> 00:07:38,283
Well, I'm on lunch duty.
Let me know what you think.
See you.

84
00:07:42,734 --> 00:07:45,612
- Mind if I sit here?
- Lots of room.

85
00:07:47,774 --> 00:07:51,608
So,I was just given
an education on the pecking order here.

86
00:07:51,774 --> 00:07:55,244
So, what's your classification
on the hierarchy?

87
00:07:55,414 --> 00:07:59,692
- Pariah.
- So, how did you get
to be a pariah?

88
00:07:59,854 --> 00:08:03,051
Well, you got to make up
your mind and persevere.

89
00:08:03,214 --> 00:08:07,127
- Congratulation!
- Thank you so much.

90
00:08:07,294 --> 00:08:12,493
- Well, you get the whole table to yourself.
- Pariahs have their perks.

91
00:08:12,654 --> 00:08:15,612
So, you want to read the play
together after school?

92
00:08:18,374 --> 00:08:23,767
Your video must be no longer than ten minutes.
It must have a beginning,a middle and an end and

93
00:08:23,934 --> 00:08:27,768
it is due in three weeks.
Ah-ah, if you start now
you'll have plenty of time.

94
00:08:27,934 --> 00:08:32,962
Remember, I want you to give
free rein to your imagination.
Explore a fantasy, whatever that means to you.
Go outside the box.

95
00:08:33,134 --> 00:08:38,891
Let the camera become an extension of your mind.
Boys, be nice to the girls And vice versa.

96
00:08:52,574 --> 00:08:57,204
- ok,why not?
- This year's going to be hard enough.
- ok.

97
00:08:59,334 --> 00:09:05,364
but, um, Trevor,
Why don't you decide who you are
before someone else does?

98
00:09:11,774 --> 00:09:15,289
- You should be more careful about
the company you keep.
- Pardon me?

99
00:09:15,454 --> 00:09:20,482
- That guy you ate lunch with,
nobody goes near him.
- Break it off, if you know
what's good for you.
- If you want any friends in this school.

100
00:09:20,654 --> 00:09:23,726
What that guy knows can kill you.

101
00:09:37,694 --> 00:09:40,447
- I don't get Josh at all.
- What do you mean,like killing kids?

102
00:09:40,614 --> 00:09:45,893
- No, I get that part.
I just don't know how you can
kill the girl that you love.
- Well, but didn't he feel betrayed by her?
- Yeah. Sure.

103
00:09:48,654 --> 00:09:51,373
Well, have you ever felt like that?

104
00:09:52,574 --> 00:09:56,726
- Do you know anything about me?
- Well, kids say some stuff.

105
00:09:56,894 --> 00:10:02,969
- What stuff?
- Some crazy stuff about you threatening
to explode the football team.

106
00:10:03,974 --> 00:10:05,930
It's true.

107
00:10:10,774 --> 00:10:15,290
- How did you get to that place?
- Ever been low?
- Like depressed?

108
00:10:17,214 --> 00:10:21,890
Well,I mean,sometimes,
But, I mean, I don't think
about exploding football teams.

109
00:10:22,854 --> 00:10:27,484
Jenny, I don't mean depressed
like your dog died.

110
00:10:27,654 --> 00:10:30,452
I mean where you feel that
you have got nothing to lose.

111
00:10:30,614 --> 00:10:35,893
Where you don't Where you don't care
if you live or die that kind of depressed.
You ever been there?

112
00:10:39,294 --> 00:10:41,728
- No.
- Okay, well, I have.

113
00:10:41,894 --> 00:10:44,727
It seem like you've done
your homework for the play.

114
00:10:44,894 --> 00:10:49,410
I don't think you're going to get into the cool cliques
if you're seen hanging out with me.

115
00:10:49,574 --> 00:10:53,089
Well, then, maybe we should make our own clique.

116
00:11:13,854 --> 00:11:16,209
- Hello, Mr. D.
- Hey, Trevor.

117
00:11:16,374 --> 00:11:19,684
- She's a trip.
- That she is.

118
00:11:21,654 --> 00:11:25,533
Uh, so, I was thinking,I'd like to,
I'd like to give the play a shot.

119
00:11:26,654 --> 00:11:28,610
- Really?
Gosh, Trevor, hum
- Yeah.

120
00:11:33,974 --> 00:11:37,762
You know, I wish you got a hold of me sooner,
because, um, you see,

121
00:11:39,734 --> 00:11:42,931
I already cast someone.

122
00:11:57,734 --> 00:11:59,690
Can I help you?

123
00:12:05,814 --> 00:12:10,649
- Excuse me.Is there a problem?
- I'd rather go elsewhere.

124
00:12:11,614 --> 00:12:17,610
I wonder how much business
I'm losing because of you.
Work in the back.

125
00:12:23,174 --> 00:12:28,248
- Trevor?How was your day?
- Uh, video class was cool.

126
00:12:28,414 --> 00:12:29,893
And?

127
00:12:30,054 --> 00:12:36,402
And people stared.
They went through my bag twice.
Somebody went through my locker.

128
00:12:36,574 --> 00:12:42,046
- Well, you got to pay the price.
- I think it'll just take time
before people will trust you again.

129
00:12:43,334 --> 00:12:47,088
- They want me to do a play.
- Trevor, that's great.

130
00:12:47,254 --> 00:12:52,726
- Yeah, but rehearsals are after school.
- Woah,woah,I need you at the cleaners
after school.That's my busy time.

131
00:12:52,894 --> 00:12:56,773
- Well, maybe I could fill in for Trevor.
- How can you do that?

132
00:12:56,934 --> 00:13:00,085
- I don't know.
I can juggle my schedule at the bank.
- We'd have to eat even later?

133
00:13:00,254 --> 00:13:02,006
Forget it.
Okay?

134
00:13:04,814 --> 00:13:07,692
- He has got to get back into
the swing of things.
- So, he does a play and gets out of
his punishment.

135
00:13:50,654 --> 00:13:55,774
This is what it would look like
if I put my head in the stove.

136
00:13:56,854 --> 00:14:00,529
Just for future reference,
it might be kind of cool.

137
00:14:00,694 --> 00:14:05,484
I mean, my highs compared
to my lows are One in a million.

138
00:14:05,654 --> 00:14:11,286
I mean,that's not true.
I mean, that's an exaggeration.
More like, you know,one in, like, 500.

139
00:14:14,894 --> 00:14:18,091
Hey, Trevor.
Let's have a look in that backpack.

140
00:14:25,374 --> 00:14:29,208
Get that thing out of my face.
Get out of here.

141
00:14:29,374 --> 00:14:31,524
You're a troublemaker.
Get out of here!

142
00:14:38,934 --> 00:14:43,849
Every time you see me if you're not
singing "Jingle Bells",
you're going to be hurt.

143
00:14:45,614 --> 00:14:49,812
You're going to be hurt,
You're going to be hurt,
Move on. Move on.

144
00:14:54,934 --> 00:14:58,051
I'll settle the score.
Hell, becoming a martyr,you know.

145
00:14:58,214 --> 00:15:03,049
Going down and teaching these bastards a lesson.
I can definitely wrap my head around it.

146
00:15:04,734 --> 00:15:07,328
- And this?
- That was the time I ran away from home.

147
00:15:07,494 --> 00:15:13,126
- Ah, peace corps?Save the world?
- Actually, the world save me.

148
00:15:15,854 --> 00:15:19,563
- This?
- Oh, a little play I did off-off Broadway.
One reviewer commented

149
00:15:19,734 --> 00:15:23,329
that I perform it off-off-off-off-off Broadway.

150
00:15:24,414 --> 00:15:29,534
- And that?
- One-man show in Seattle.
Reviews like my mother wrote them.
So, they got a star took it to New-York.
They all made a lot of money.

151
00:15:29,694 --> 00:15:31,889
More wine?

152
00:15:36,374 --> 00:15:39,810
- You know, you're the hot topic
in the teachers' lounge.
- Is that right?

153
00:15:39,974 --> 00:15:45,207
They all wonder why you've cast the "mad bomber"
as a cold-blooded murderer in
Bang bang you're dead meat.

154
00:15:45,374 --> 00:15:51,324
Bang bang,bang bang you're dead,
and I don't think calling him
the "mad bomber" is that helpful.
If you could have known Trevor before all this.

155
00:15:51,494 --> 00:15:55,567
- he's the kind of kid you got into teaching for.
- Said Don Quixote.

156
00:15:55,734 --> 00:16:01,684
- He's the most honest kid
I've ever worked with.
- Honest?Are we talking about the same kid?

157
00:16:14,854 --> 00:16:18,563
It's garlic bread flambe my speciality.

158
00:16:25,254 --> 00:16:28,849
All right, let's jump in.
Josh,deceased

159
00:16:29,014 --> 00:16:35,203
up on stage, please.
Uh, what we're going to do here is
we're not going to worry about the words.

160
00:16:35,374 --> 00:16:40,129
We're just going to get into
the rhythm starting with Josh.
It's okay to be nervous.And...

161
00:16:50,814 --> 00:16:52,645
Who's there?

162
00:16:56,134 --> 00:17:00,844
- So, I'm in jail and these are the kids
that I killed earlier today?
- Correct.

163
00:17:01,014 --> 00:17:06,452
- So, obviously, the play takes place in my head.
- The five deceased are figments of your imagination.

164
00:17:06,614 --> 00:17:09,970
- If they're in my head,
why am I talking to them?
- Ah.

165
00:17:11,134 --> 00:17:14,888
- So,the whole play is in my head.
- Ah.

166
00:17:16,294 --> 00:17:19,252
- So I'm obviously wrestling with my conscience.
- Ah.

167
00:17:20,454 --> 00:17:25,482
Why would I conjure them up if I know
they're only going to torment me?

168
00:17:38,814 --> 00:17:40,964
Hey, let's hear it.
Jingle bells, jingle bells,jin...

169
00:17:55,254 --> 00:18:01,409
So, uh, let's talk about your triggers,
you know,things that set you off.

170
00:18:01,574 --> 00:18:06,807
By recognizing the trigger you can stop it
before it gets you into trouble.
So, come on

171
00:18:06,974 --> 00:18:10,762
tell me something
that really ticks you off.

172
00:18:14,094 --> 00:18:17,131
- That's hard.
- Mm-hmm, I know, I know.Just

173
00:18:17,294 --> 00:18:19,091
cause, uh

174
00:18:20,494 --> 00:18:23,566
I just love... everyone.

175
00:18:24,854 --> 00:18:29,370
This isn't going to work unless
you open up, okay?

176
00:18:29,534 --> 00:18:35,643
- Open up so you can use it against me?
- If you don't want to talk then
you can use this time to study.

177
00:18:45,654 --> 00:18:49,010
- "...make them squirm.
It's killing me not to tell."
- Okay,so,just tell

178
00:18:50,654 --> 00:18:53,726
- You got it?
- No.Uh, pizza after school.

179
00:18:53,894 --> 00:18:56,488
- Are you ready?
- Yeah.
- What are you doing?

180
00:18:56,654 --> 00:19:00,613
I don't think I want the camera on anymore.
We have work to do. Come on.Come on.

181
00:19:10,734 --> 00:19:14,204
- Josh, there's no way we're buying
you a rifle.
- Mom, will you listen to me?

182
00:19:14,374 --> 00:19:19,732
- First you had to have a pc then every
video games ever made and a laptop?
- For school, dad.

183
00:19:38,614 --> 00:19:41,731
- You wanted to see me?
- Yes, Val,have a seat.

184
00:19:45,614 --> 00:19:49,323
Hello, I understand you're doing some kind of play
about a kid who commits a mass murder.

185
00:19:49,494 --> 00:19:51,724
I will pull my boy out of school.

186
00:19:51,894 --> 00:19:57,366
Mrs. Meyers my daughter tells me she's in a play
called "Bang bang you're dead".
I can't fathom why you would

187
00:19:58,094 --> 00:20:04,044
Hi, this is police chief Bud McGee.
I'm calling to inquire about a rumor of a play
at your school about a kid killer.

188
00:20:04,214 --> 00:20:07,411
- I get the point.
- There's much more,much more
and none of it good.

189
00:20:07,574 --> 00:20:11,044
- Have you even read it?
- I don't need to.
The title alone could spark the
powder keg that we're sitting on

190
00:20:11,214 --> 00:20:15,571
- This play's had thousands of productions.
- When a school installs an $ 11,000
metal detector at his front door

191
00:20:15,734 --> 00:20:19,283
- it can't turn around and
do a play called Bang bang you die.
- Bang bang you're dead.

192
00:20:19,454 --> 00:20:23,891
What would you suggest?
Maybe we should do Romeo and Juliet,
Two teenagers commit suicide?

193
00:20:24,054 --> 00:20:27,046
Touche, Val.Let's find some more
suitable entertainement.

194
00:20:28,894 --> 00:20:31,044
You don't really mean that.

195
00:20:31,214 --> 00:20:37,289
- Hey.We're rehearsing.
- Sorry, guys.We're signed
up for this room at 4:00.

196
00:20:37,454 --> 00:20:42,528
- Yeah, well, it's not time,so shut the door.
- You got three minutes.

197
00:20:42,694 --> 00:20:45,492
Make it five.You interrupted us.

198
00:20:48,534 --> 00:20:50,490
For school, dad.
Um... the newest style of nikes
every three months.

199
00:20:55,654 --> 00:20:58,293
Let's just rehearse someplace else.

200
00:21:11,614 --> 00:21:15,926
I don't know what your problem is,
dude but you don't scare me.

201
00:21:17,694 --> 00:21:23,803
You know what my problem is?
This is a theater rehearsal room.
We can't do a play on a football field,
can we?

202
00:21:23,974 --> 00:21:26,613
- We're rehearsing the pep rally.
- Really?That's neat.

203
00:21:26,774 --> 00:21:28,127
Just relax.

204
00:21:28,294 --> 00:21:32,572
Hey, are you messing with Trev again?
Next time, you get launched.

205
00:21:32,734 --> 00:21:35,294
I'd like to see how bad you talk
when you're alone, head case.

206
00:21:35,454 --> 00:21:39,766
- We don't have numbers on our backs.
That's doesn't mean we don't play hard.
- Why wait?

207
00:21:40,814 --> 00:21:43,169
Hey, Trevor,we're going.

208
00:21:57,374 --> 00:21:58,853
- Ammonium, nitrate.
- What?

209
00:21:59,014 --> 00:22:03,690
Kerosene,fuse,match,Boom!

210
00:22:05,054 --> 00:22:08,205
I'm real scared, trashcan.

212
00:22:37,414 --> 00:22:39,166
hey,Trev

213
00:22:42,014 --> 00:22:48,203
- I have to go manage some anger.
- We have a place where we,
um,manage our anger, too.

214
00:22:50,774 --> 00:22:52,412
Want to go for a ride?

215
00:23:15,054 --> 00:23:18,126
- What do you think?
- Go ahead.
- Hurry up.

216
00:23:20,254 --> 00:23:25,203
- Excuse me.Excuse me, I'm sorry.
I don't know your name.
- Uh, new girl.

217
00:23:25,374 --> 00:23:28,332
Well, I'm two times 22,but you can call me 44.

218
00:23:29,774 --> 00:23:32,163
You know it wouldn't kill you to smile.

219
00:23:32,334 --> 00:23:36,043
Listent, I'm sorry about what
happened in the rehearsal room.

220
00:23:36,214 --> 00:23:41,083
That Brad guy, he's a demon out on the field
but sometimes he gets a little carried away

221
00:23:41,254 --> 00:23:46,328
- I just hope you don't
think we're all like that.
- Well, I did,but now I don't,bye

222
00:23:47,334 --> 00:23:52,283
- "Bye" is such an ugly word.I much prefer like
"See you at lunch tomorrow."
- No, thank you.

223
00:23:52,454 --> 00:23:57,847
- You got a thing against jocks, too?
- No, I just never found a reason to wear one.

224
00:23:58,014 --> 00:24:02,292
- I'm glad about that.
You going to the game on saturday?
- No.

225
00:24:02,454 --> 00:24:06,129
I'll tell you what.
You come to the game on saturday
and I'll go see your play.

226
00:24:06,294 --> 00:24:08,046
- Well, that's not fair.
- Why's that?

227
00:24:08,214 --> 00:24:11,126
Well, you get culture and refinement.

228
00:24:11,294 --> 00:24:14,252
and I get a bunch of roughnecks banging
their heads together.bye.

229
00:24:17,894 --> 00:24:21,284
- What's up with this act?
- I play this guy who kills his parents

230
00:24:21,454 --> 00:24:24,730
and goes into his school and offs 5 of his classmates.

231
00:25:18,254 --> 00:25:22,452
We don't bring just anyone here.
Just so you know.

232
00:25:40,414 --> 00:25:42,166
Want a beer?

233
00:25:55,454 --> 00:25:58,252
This is a place where we can be ourselves.

234
00:26:15,974 --> 00:26:18,283
Feels like respect.

235
00:26:26,774 --> 00:26:28,526
I like.

236
00:26:55,734 --> 00:26:57,964
see ya, Trev.

237
00:27:06,854 --> 00:27:11,132
- Don't take that attitude with me!
- Just calm down.
- What the hell are you doing out
at that time of night?

238
00:27:11,294 --> 00:27:15,845
i thought the play was canceled?

239
00:27:35,454 --> 00:27:36,887
From the top again.

240
00:27:37,054 --> 00:27:40,171
Josh, with the gun and...

241
00:27:44,294 --> 00:27:47,286
- Love that feeling!
- Love it.
- Crave it.
- Need it.

242
00:27:47,454 --> 00:27:50,332
Got to have a gun grip in your hand.

243
00:27:50,494 --> 00:27:54,043
I always wanted to be an army ranger
parachuting behind enemy lines,
ever since I could hold a

244
00:27:54,214 --> 00:27:56,648
- Cap gun.
- Water gun.
- Air gun.

245
00:27:56,814 --> 00:27:58,884
- Pop gun. - B.B. gun.
- .12-gauge.

246
00:27:59,054 --> 00:28:01,124
- .38
- .45

247
00:28:06,974 --> 00:28:10,933
- A gun makes you feel alive.
- Respect.
- Watch out.
- Move aside.

248
00:28:11,094 --> 00:28:15,565
What the hell is this?
Wrong table, ladies.Time to move, girls.
This is the men's table

249
00:28:15,734 --> 00:28:19,727
and you are sitting in my seat.
So why don't you and your little
freaky friends get up and move?

250
00:28:19,894 --> 00:28:23,682
- What's your problem,uh, you little freak?
- Cause we don't wanna.
- You want to take this outside?
- I'm right here.

251
00:28:23,854 --> 00:28:26,049
- Take me.Come on.
- I'm not scared

252
00:28:28,214 --> 00:28:30,250
Sean, that's cool.Let's go, guys.

253
00:28:30,414 --> 00:28:32,370
- Nobody can touch you
- When you have a gun

254
00:28:32,534 --> 00:28:35,924
- Nobody mocks you
- when you have a gun
- You can take on anybody
- anybody

255
00:28:36,094 --> 00:28:38,608
- The champ wrestler
- the whole wrestling team

256
00:28:38,774 --> 00:28:41,527
- the bad dudes
- the gangbangers

257
00:28:45,614 --> 00:28:47,889
- Get in, dude!
- Let me out!

258
00:28:54,454 --> 00:28:59,244
- When you have a gun,people talk nice.
- When you have a gun,
people look at you like a VIP.

259
00:29:09,614 --> 00:29:12,845
- You walk different.
- when you have a gun.
- You talk different

260
00:29:13,014 --> 00:29:16,484
- when you have a gun
- You think different
- when you have a gun
- It's so cool

261
00:29:22,974 --> 00:29:24,930
It's an A+
Slam dunk

262
00:29:25,094 --> 00:29:27,688

263
00:29:27,854 --> 00:29:30,926
- Love that military stance

264
00:29:36,574 --> 00:29:38,212
Respect.

265
00:29:40,374 --> 00:29:44,890
- Principal's Mayor's office.
- Bomb, 2:00.

266
00:30:02,534 --> 00:30:04,331
- Watch out!
- Move aside.

267
00:30:04,494 --> 00:30:09,648
- You can be anything you want to be.
- Because a gun in your hand is a Ph.D.

268
00:30:18,014 --> 00:30:19,970
You just met Josh.

269
00:30:33,694 --> 00:30:36,766
Hey, trev, It's for you.

270
00:30:40,614 --> 00:30:42,650
- Now you're one of us.
- Thank you.

271
00:30:44,334 --> 00:30:48,771
Hey, Trev,ast year, were you really going to blow up
the football team or was that just talk?

272
00:30:48,934 --> 00:30:52,483
I'm not that kind of person
I've been counseled.

273
00:30:52,654 --> 00:30:56,533
So, you really don't know
how to make a bomb?

274
00:31:07,974 --> 00:31:09,930
Is this dangerous?

275
00:31:11,454 --> 00:31:14,571
Only if you stand here.

276
00:31:28,094 --> 00:31:30,562
So, we cut the wire,like that.

277
00:31:32,494 --> 00:31:34,610
You take the detonator.

278
00:31:34,774 --> 00:31:37,447
Put the wire in the detonator.

279
00:31:38,694 --> 00:31:43,722
All right, you watch the car?
We're going to pull the pin.
Now, I got two seconds.

280
00:31:54,574 --> 00:31:57,134
Imagine a truckful.

281
00:33:26,574 --> 00:33:28,883
- How are you?
- Ah, I'm okay.

282
00:33:29,054 --> 00:33:32,171
- How's your wrist?
- It hurts.

283
00:33:39,734 --> 00:33:44,046
- You were seen sitting with the troggs.
- Where the firecrackers were found.

284
00:33:44,214 --> 00:33:46,284
Cheering the opposing team?

285
00:33:47,694 --> 00:33:52,290
- What about the writing on the wall?
- Do you know what inducing panic
in a public place will fetch?

286
00:33:52,454 --> 00:33:54,649
6 months minimum.

287
00:33:55,934 --> 00:34:00,564
I didn't do it.
I don't know who did it.

288
00:34:00,734 --> 00:34:03,453
That's all I have to say.

289
00:34:05,774 --> 00:34:07,730
All right, you can go.

290
00:34:19,654 --> 00:34:24,250
- Jenny, what happened?
- Come on, Trevor,
you were sitting right there.

291
00:34:24,414 --> 00:34:28,851
- Is your hand okay?
- Well, I'm luckier than most.
It's only a sprained wrist.

292
00:34:29,014 --> 00:34:31,972
- You don't think I had anything
to do with it, do you?
- I can't say you didn't warn me.

293
00:34:32,134 --> 00:34:35,604
Every day I take a grief from kids
for hanging out with you.

294
00:34:38,614 --> 00:34:41,003
Jenny, I didn't do it,Okay?

295
00:34:51,934 --> 00:34:56,564
- Trev!Trev!
You want to go manage some anger?
- Can't.

296
00:35:03,814 --> 00:35:10,162
- No, we don't have any leads.
- Now, look, maybe it's a harmless prank or
maybe it's a warning shot across our bow.

297
00:35:10,334 --> 00:35:15,089
- It might be the perpetrator's
crying out for help.
- What about the Adams boy?
We all know it's him.

298
00:35:15,254 --> 00:35:17,051
No, I'm sorry.We don't know that.

299
00:35:17,214 --> 00:35:20,365
Why take a chance?!Boot him out!
You have discretionary powers!

300
00:35:20,534 --> 00:35:26,404
We can't take action on suspicion
or we will be sued.
Our internal security keeps a close watch
on all suspicious persons.

301
00:35:26,574 --> 00:35:31,648
- What does he have to do before you'll act?
- If your security's so good, how'd they get
the bullet pass the metal detector?

302
00:35:31,814 --> 00:35:35,011
- Nothing is 100%.
- Does the damn metal detector even work?

303
00:35:35,174 --> 00:35:38,610
This used to be a nice place to live.
Now, it's just like every other place.

304
00:35:38,774 --> 00:35:42,005
Seems like all education stopped
'cause of one boy.

305
00:35:42,174 --> 00:35:46,133
If anyone has any evidence linking
Trevor Adams to anything
they should bring that forward or
they should just be quiet.

306
00:35:46,294 --> 00:35:50,765
- Mr. Duncan makes an important point.
- Speaking of wich, what about this
"Bang, bang, I'm going to kill you"?

307
00:35:50,934 --> 00:35:54,768
- Bang bang you're dead.
- Seems there's no control here.
Why is a play like that being done?

308
00:35:54,934 --> 00:35:58,210
- Cause we couldn't get the rights
to say"Hello, dolly".
- Mr. Duncan.
- I'm sorry.

309
00:35:58,374 --> 00:36:01,969
- But look, has anyone here
even bothered to read this play?
- That play has been disallowed in this school.

310
00:36:02,134 --> 00:36:07,003
He's doing it at the community theater
with high school students.
My daughter was in it until
I had her yanked out.

311
00:36:07,174 --> 00:36:09,324
Yes, the play's being done on free time
but not on school property.

312
00:36:09,494 --> 00:36:13,453
If nothing is done about this.
I'm pulling my kid out of this school.

313
00:36:16,294 --> 00:36:20,810
We're entitled to freedom of expression
outside the school grounds as long as
it doesn't reflect poorly on the school.
We're not doing anything illegal or immoral.

314
00:36:20,974 --> 00:36:26,571
- You might have informed me.
- It's a play.
- A play that has no answers.
- Do you have answers?
- A play that stir up emotions and leaves kids hanging.

315
00:36:26,734 --> 00:36:30,522
Is a metal detector the answer?
You put a metal detector in the school,
you turn every kid into a suspect.

316
00:36:30,694 --> 00:36:33,413
We don't know what else we can do.

317
00:36:34,494 --> 00:36:40,683
Look, I know you have a hard job,I do.
But it's not what's in a kid's backpack
that makes him dangerous.

318
00:36:40,854 --> 00:36:45,974
It's what's in his heart.
This play is the best way I know
how to look into a kid's heart.

319
00:36:46,134 --> 00:36:50,685
And I know you mean well
but I must ask you, put this thing off.

320
00:36:50,854 --> 00:36:55,166
- You know I won't do that.
- Then you leave me no choice but
to go before the board...

321
00:36:55,334 --> 00:36:57,484
and the union.

322
00:37:00,774 --> 00:37:05,768
This school saw fit to ban the play but
the drama teacher thumbed his nose at the school ...

323
00:37:05,934 --> 00:37:10,883
- and his now rehearsing the play
in the community theater.
- That theater receives city support
and we want them tossed out.

324
00:37:11,054 --> 00:37:13,522
If not, we're going to get a lawyer
and sue the town.

325
00:37:23,134 --> 00:37:24,533
What gives?

326
00:37:35,214 --> 00:37:37,774
They gave us the boot.

327
00:37:39,854 --> 00:37:41,685
All right, this is it.

328
00:38:17,014 --> 00:38:20,131
Hey!You like this?

329
00:38:21,894 --> 00:38:27,287
How would like to do this
for the rest of your life?
Well, this is it if you get expelled!

330
00:38:32,294 --> 00:38:37,812
Okay,so,Boy bands versus girl bands.right?
Sometimes it is hard to tell the difference.
well done,Who's next?

331
00:38:40,934 --> 00:38:45,849
Okay, now the rest of you remember,
you will be graded on your critiques.

332
00:38:46,014 --> 00:38:50,007
I want see in these critiques criteria
objective criteria.

333
00:38:50,174 --> 00:38:54,167
I don't want to see "I think",
"I feel" or "in my opinion".

334
00:41:36,934 --> 00:41:39,926
- Well, this is a death threat.
- It's a fantasy.It's not real.

335
00:41:40,094 --> 00:41:43,689
- You really don't think this is a treath
against 32, against Brad?
- Yes, in video, but not in fact.

336
00:41:43,854 --> 00:41:47,927
- Val, Trevor is still being Trevor.
- Come on, Ellie, don't you think
it's possible you're a tad prejudiced?

337
00:41:48,094 --> 00:41:51,769
Why did you show me?
Because you had your own
doubts and rightly so.

338
00:41:51,934 --> 00:41:55,609
Val, you're so caught up in who Trevor was,
you can't see waht he's become.
You have to report this.

339
00:41:55,774 --> 00:41:58,208
If I report it, he'll see me as
another clueless adult.
I'm on the verge of a breaktrough.

340
00:41:58,374 --> 00:42:03,243
- Well, don't ask me if
you don't want my opinion.
- I didn't say that.
- Not in those words.

341
00:42:04,294 --> 00:42:08,128
- I know you need to do your Quixote thing.
- Oh... what's that?Is that a dig?

342
00:42:08,294 --> 00:42:13,573
No, it's a compliment, Val.
You're a very high-minded guy but some people
will say you've crossed a professional line.

343
00:42:13,734 --> 00:42:19,570
Tell some people what they call professional
I call sitting up in the bleachers, okay.
Tell some people to come down here on the playing field
'cause it mighty lonely down here.

344
00:42:19,734 --> 00:42:21,725
- You mean me.
- I don't know who I mean.

345
00:42:21,894 --> 00:42:24,203
I think you do.

346
00:42:26,094 --> 00:42:30,292
- You're right.
- So did I see this video or not?
- What do you mean?

347
00:42:30,454 --> 00:42:34,493
When kids tell their parents and
parents start calling the school
I don't want anybody asking me
why I didn't report this.

348
00:42:34,654 --> 00:42:39,444
No, you didn't see it.
Yes,I'll report it.

349
00:42:39,614 --> 00:42:42,287
Thanks for taking the time.

350
00:43:19,014 --> 00:43:21,289
Hi, thespians.

351
00:43:21,454 --> 00:43:25,242
Ah... savage youth.
On stage.On stage with all of you.

352
00:43:27,894 --> 00:43:31,773
Eh, uh, Trevor,
can I talk to you for a minute?
Here, grab a seat.

353
00:43:35,894 --> 00:43:37,930
Listen, um

354
00:43:40,614 --> 00:43:44,766
I had to turn your video over to the principal.
I tought it might violate zero tolerance policy.

355
00:43:44,934 --> 00:43:48,847
So, I'm giving you a heads up.
Meyer may want to slap your
wrist tomorrow morning.

356
00:43:49,894 --> 00:43:51,646
Looking foward.

357
00:44:18,734 --> 00:44:22,932
Stupid, stupid, stupid,stupid, stupid!
I wish someone would take me out of my misery.

358
00:44:23,094 --> 00:44:25,244
- Who's there?
- Boom!
- No more pain.

359
00:44:25,414 --> 00:44:29,293
- Who said that?
- You.
- Your life is over, Josh.

360
00:44:29,454 --> 00:44:32,173
Do it in the living room for
you parents to see.

361
00:44:32,334 --> 00:44:36,566
- What do you mean?
- Leave your brains all over the wall.
- Make them feel bad.
- The shotgun's locked in the closet.

362
00:44:36,734 --> 00:44:39,089
Break the lock.

363
00:44:40,374 --> 00:44:43,013
- No more pain.
- That's dumb.

364
00:44:43,174 --> 00:44:46,484
- Only you can make them stop, Josh.
- How?

365
00:44:46,654 --> 00:44:49,726
- You know.
- What do you mean?
- Boom!
- Woah!

366
00:44:49,894 --> 00:44:53,682
- One bullet would quiet them forever.
- You'd end your pain stop the voices in your head.

367
00:44:53,854 --> 00:44:57,847
- I don't want to be thinking this.
- Show them who you are.
- The whole school will stand in awe of you.

368
00:44:58,014 --> 00:45:03,088
- You'll be a legend for years to come.
- Kill the voices, Josh.

369
00:45:03,254 --> 00:45:06,052
- Uh... does it hurt?
- Bullet in the head?Never feel a thing.

370
00:45:06,214 --> 00:45:08,170
I'm scared.

371
00:45:09,174 --> 00:45:12,689
- How do I do this?
- Make your face a mask.
- A mask that hides your face.

372
00:45:12,854 --> 00:45:16,847
- A face that hides the pain.
- A pain that eats your heart.
- A heart nobody knows.

373
00:45:17,054 --> 00:45:20,888
- Here goes.But suppose I butch it?
- You'll be a joke:

374
00:45:21,054 --> 00:45:25,889
"Hey, hear about Josh?He tried
to off himself but he blew it."

375
00:45:26,054 --> 00:45:28,329
Now he's a pathetic wanna-be forever.

376
00:45:30,334 --> 00:45:32,689
- What's the matter?
- This is stupid.

377
00:45:32,854 --> 00:45:35,243
- Why is it stupid?
- I don't know.It's just stupid.

378
00:45:35,414 --> 00:45:40,010
Instead of running around, wasting everyone's time
why don't you tell me why it's stupid?

379
00:45:40,174 --> 00:45:43,928
Guy steals my girl.
I go totally ballistic.
I contemplate suicide.

380
00:45:44,094 --> 00:45:48,485
I off my parents.I kill a bunch of kids.
It makes no sense.

381
00:45:48,654 --> 00:45:53,250
- It made perfect sense to you last year
when you made the bomb threat.
- I don't know what you mean.

382
00:45:53,414 --> 00:45:57,566
You know exactly what I mean.
You made the bomb threat.
You endangered lots of kids' lifes.
You took the first step toward killing.

383
00:45:57,734 --> 00:46:00,168
- Anyone die?
- Beside the point.

384
00:46:00,334 --> 00:46:03,167
- What's the point?
- Point is you took that step.

385
00:46:03,334 --> 00:46:05,529
- The bomb was empty.
- And perfectly made.
- Totally harmless.

386
00:46:05,694 --> 00:46:11,132
Most people don't take that step.You did.
Now, who's to say you
won't take the next step?

387
00:46:11,294 --> 00:46:14,923
- It went no further.
- Josh did.

388
00:46:15,094 --> 00:46:17,244
Josh did.Why?

389
00:46:18,294 --> 00:46:20,205
Why, Trevor?

390
00:46:20,374 --> 00:46:26,006
What do you have that Josh doesn't have?
What do you have that
Josh doesn't have, Trevor?

391
00:46:26,174 --> 00:46:29,689
Fear of Punishment? Conscience?
God perhaps? Ten commandments?
Too chicken?

392
00:46:31,174 --> 00:46:34,211
Whatever it is,let's call it "X".

393
00:46:35,334 --> 00:46:40,124
Now, tell me, Trevor, what would happen
if were to reach right into your soul

394
00:46:40,294 --> 00:46:42,649
and remove "X"?

395
00:46:44,254 --> 00:46:46,210
I'd be Josh.

396
00:46:48,214 --> 00:46:50,409
Yeah.You'd be Josh.

397
00:47:28,934 --> 00:47:33,849
Mr. and Mrs. Adams?
I'm sorry about all this.
If there's anything I can do

398
00:47:34,014 --> 00:47:38,690
- Don't put our son in any more of your plays.
- With all due respect, Mr. adams,I don't think

399
00:47:38,854 --> 00:47:42,369
Listen, Trevor was on the right track
then you made him a killer in that play.

400
00:47:42,534 --> 00:47:46,891
Then you give him the assignement to make a movie
about a killer and now here we are.

401
00:47:47,054 --> 00:47:51,809
- The assignement was not exactly to
- Listen, you can split hairs.
We don't have that luxury.

402
00:47:51,974 --> 00:47:55,489
- I understand how you feel.
- You have kids?
- No, sir, I don't.

403
00:47:55,654 --> 00:48:00,933
Then, you can't understand.
Something like this could ruin Trevor's life

404
00:48:01,094 --> 00:48:06,964
so why don't you just stick to
teaching and let us raise our son.

405
00:48:18,734 --> 00:48:22,329
We're losing business.
People won't even come in the store.

406
00:48:22,494 --> 00:48:25,611
People stare at me when
I'm in the supermarket.

407
00:48:25,774 --> 00:48:30,211
- One lady said I was unfit mother.
- I wouldn't be surprised if you did
that firecracker thing.

408
00:48:30,374 --> 00:48:34,845
- Always down in your cave.
- Ever since you moved down the stairs
- Always on the internet.
- We hardly know you.Graphs in the toilet.

409
00:48:35,014 --> 00:48:39,212
- Police raiding and searching our home.
- What college do you think you'll get into?

410
00:48:39,374 --> 00:48:42,525
When your brother was your age
he was on the honor roll.

411
00:49:01,334 --> 00:49:04,565
- Trevor, let's talk.
- I'm going to bed.

412
00:49:04,734 --> 00:49:06,964
- I don't know how to help you.
- You can't.

413
00:49:07,134 --> 00:49:11,286
I would know how to help you if I knew
what was going on inside your head.

414
00:49:11,454 --> 00:49:14,173
There's nothing you can do.

415
00:49:20,374 --> 00:49:23,013
Do you know where your gun is?

416
00:49:32,094 --> 00:49:34,733
Do you want to talk to him
before he goes to bed?

417
00:49:36,214 --> 00:49:39,286
What's the use?We've said it all before.

418
00:50:00,174 --> 00:50:03,530
Do you think he could get a gun
from someplace else?

419
00:50:04,974 --> 00:50:06,930
Anything's possible.

420
00:50:35,494 --> 00:50:37,962
- Am I calling too late?
- No.

421
00:50:38,134 --> 00:50:42,252
- Was jail terrible?
- Actually

422
00:50:42,414 --> 00:50:46,692
- the sandwich was pretty good
- The police called here.

423
00:50:46,854 --> 00:50:51,484
They asked me some questions about you,
just dumb stuff.My parents freaked.

424
00:50:54,014 --> 00:50:58,326
- Well, I made some videos and
you're in one or two.
- I'm in one or two?

425
00:50:58,494 --> 00:51:04,205
- Yeah, and I said some stuff.
- What stuff?

426
00:51:04,374 --> 00:51:06,126
Stuff about you.

427
00:51:07,214 --> 00:51:09,489
Nothing bad.

428
00:51:09,654 --> 00:51:13,203
- Are they going to expel you?
- I don't know.

429
00:51:13,374 --> 00:51:16,172
Will you be able to do the play?

430
00:51:17,774 --> 00:51:21,005
Well,Mr. D's the one who turn me in, so

431
00:51:21,174 --> 00:51:24,325
- Why would he do that?
- I have no...

432
00:51:40,654 --> 00:51:42,610
Trevor, what's wrong?

433
00:51:48,174 --> 00:51:49,926
Are you okay?

434
00:51:51,174 --> 00:51:53,324
I slipped.

435
00:51:53,734 --> 00:51:56,294
- Hello?
- Dad, I'm on.
- Who are you talking to?

436
00:51:56,454 --> 00:52:01,244
- Just a friend.
- I know who it is.
Say good-bye to him and tell him
not to call here anymore.

437
00:52:03,374 --> 00:52:06,411
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- I'm sorry.

438
00:52:08,414 --> 00:52:12,123
- I'm glad you called.
- Me, too.

439
00:52:16,414 --> 00:52:20,532
- Why would you want to be
associated with that troublemaker?
- You don't even know him.

440
00:52:20,694 --> 00:52:25,290
Honey, the school doesn't want the play.
The town doesn't want the play.
Why do you want to do it?

441
00:52:25,454 --> 00:52:29,766
- Because I don't let other people
make up my mind for me.
- You can't reason with her.

442
00:52:29,934 --> 00:52:33,370
You can't do the play.
Not as long as that kid's in it.

443
00:52:36,974 --> 00:52:40,125
Look who:
"King of the Troggs."

444
00:52:41,214 --> 00:52:46,163
Hey, King Trogg,know what time it is?
It's Swirly time!

445
00:52:53,734 --> 00:52:55,804
Whoo, in you go!

446
00:53:08,574 --> 00:53:10,530
Yeah, come on!

447
00:53:21,134 --> 00:53:25,207
Can't resist a windmill,
can you, Quixote?

448
00:53:40,174 --> 00:53:42,449
So, who owns the gun?

449
00:53:44,214 --> 00:53:49,971
Trevor, good guys tell the truth.
The gun belongs to somebody underage,right?

450
00:53:51,774 --> 00:53:54,572
You're painting yourself into a corner,
Trevor.

451
00:53:54,734 --> 00:53:57,931
- What does 32 mean?
- It's just a number.

452
00:53:58,094 --> 00:54:02,087
A number that happens to match the football
jersey of our varsity running back.

453
00:54:02,254 --> 00:54:06,167
- Why this animosity between
you and Brad Larkin?
- I did the assignement.

454
00:54:06,334 --> 00:54:11,613
- And what exactly was this assignment?
- Here's the assignment sheet.

455
00:54:11,774 --> 00:54:15,244
You'll see that Trevor did exactly
what I asked him to.

456
00:54:15,414 --> 00:54:18,690
Well, if he only did what you asked him to
why did you turn him in?

457
00:54:18,854 --> 00:54:21,891
I let the school look at a videotape.
That's simply our policy.

458
00:54:22,054 --> 00:54:25,524
That's correct.
We expect all teachers to report
all kinds of threats.

459
00:54:25,694 --> 00:54:30,131
- Why would you put on,
"Bang, bang, everyone's dead"?
- Bang Bang you're Dead.

460
00:54:31,294 --> 00:54:37,529
And cast a student at risk as the play's killer
in a supercharged atmosphere?

461
00:54:37,694 --> 00:54:41,289
Didn't you fear you might set him off?

462
00:54:41,454 --> 00:54:46,323
I think when you label a kid "at risk"
you just created a kid at risk.

463
00:54:46,494 --> 00:54:50,533
Trevor gets onstage to play Josh,
he faces himself,and that's good.

464
00:54:50,694 --> 00:54:57,850
Then when a school need a scapegoat Trevor's
hauled off down to the office for interrogation
and that more than any play is the kind
of thing that could set someone off.

465
00:55:01,174 --> 00:55:04,211
Trevor, how do you explain your video?

466
00:55:05,774 --> 00:55:10,131
- You've already made up your mind.
- Trevor, please.
They're only trying to understand.

467
00:55:10,294 --> 00:55:15,926
No kid likes to admit he's being bullied.
It makes him feel small in the eyes of his peers.
Makes him a little kid who can't
stand up for himself.

468
00:55:16,094 --> 00:55:18,483
Some kids would rather get beat
than talk about it,

469
00:55:18,654 --> 00:55:22,647
so if you want to get to the truth
call Brad Larkin down here.
Ask him to explain how this video
came into being.

470
00:55:22,814 --> 00:55:27,046
- Brad Larkin's had no part in
making this videotape.
- Brad Larkin inspired it.
He inspired it.

471
00:55:27,214 --> 00:55:32,607
Look, everyone in this room needs
to face one simple fact and that is
before last year Trevor was a model student.

472
00:55:32,774 --> 00:55:38,053
Mr. Larkin can tell you how
and why that changed.

473
00:55:38,214 --> 00:55:43,527
- Mr. Duncan, thank you.
- I'd like to see what's on those tapes.
We found these among Trevor's possessions.

474
00:55:43,694 --> 00:55:49,485
Apparently he likes to take a video
camera to school every day.
Let's see what's on that tape first.

475
00:55:49,654 --> 00:55:55,012
- Why did you take a video camera
to school every day?
- Same reason you bring a gun to work
to shoot people.

476
00:55:55,174 --> 00:55:58,849
Trevor, just because they cast you as the bad guy
doesn't mean you have to play the part.

477
00:55:59,014 --> 00:56:03,724
- Look at this piece of trash.
- What are you doing?Nice camera,
you geek.Get out of our school.

478
00:56:05,574 --> 00:56:09,089
When I'm gone you'll all have this to ponder

479
00:56:09,254 --> 00:56:13,805
and maybe realize why I did what I did.

480
00:56:16,214 --> 00:56:19,524
A little push in front of other kids
is a very big deal

481
00:56:19,814 --> 00:56:22,567
particularly when you know it's going
to happen to you

482
00:56:22,734 --> 00:56:25,532
every single day.
Every single day.

483
00:56:25,894 --> 00:56:27,532
You're almost relieved

484
00:56:27,694 --> 00:56:29,889
when it actually happens.

485
00:56:31,894 --> 00:56:36,684
You're always waiting,
waiting for the next attack.

486
00:56:38,454 --> 00:56:42,083
Hey, Trashcan.Reach puberty yet?

487
00:56:43,374 --> 00:56:45,126
Lick it!

488
00:56:57,414 --> 00:57:01,293
They don't just hurt kids.
They make you hurt yourself.

489
00:57:07,534 --> 00:57:11,129
I can't take two more years of this.

490
00:57:11,294 --> 00:57:15,651
And the more they call me the "mad bomber"
the more they're scaring themselves.

491
00:57:15,814 --> 00:57:19,648
They don't know what I'm capable of.
They don't know what I can do.

492
00:57:19,814 --> 00:57:24,330
- And then there's the sanctuary
or home sweet home.
- How many times do I have to
tell you to cut the grass?!

493
00:57:24,494 --> 00:57:27,725
- You say "okay", but you don't do it.
- What's going on in here?

494
00:57:27,894 --> 00:57:31,011
- Is it too much to ask for you to spend
half an hour cutting the grass?
- I said okay.

495
00:57:31,174 --> 00:57:35,247
You say okay, but you're
still inside the house.
You know how many hours a week I work?

496
00:57:35,414 --> 00:57:38,929
- It takes over an hour to cut the grass.
- I don't care if it takes 5 hours
to cut the grass.

497
00:57:39,094 --> 00:57:42,291
- Dad, I said I'd cut the grass!
- Well, go cut the grass!

498
00:57:45,094 --> 00:57:47,608
All right, so, the play.Yes?

499
00:57:47,774 --> 00:57:53,644
Mr. D,gooder.Why does he even bother?
Doesn't he know it's already too late?

500
00:57:55,534 --> 00:58:02,007
Sometimes I see the way things could have been
I just wish I could be the person
she thinks I am.

501
00:58:03,894 --> 00:58:09,173
Kids can be the most ruthless
people in the world.
They can just be supernaturally cruel.

502
00:58:24,614 --> 00:58:26,445
Stop it!

503
00:58:33,294 --> 00:58:35,649
Get out of my face!

504
00:58:39,614 --> 00:58:42,447
Got to be a man.Be a man!

505
00:58:42,614 --> 00:58:46,209
Sometimes you just want
you just want to cry.

506
00:58:47,774 --> 00:58:50,447
Sometimes hate is the only
real thing in the world.

507
00:58:50,614 --> 00:58:54,653
You can stop loving somebody but
hate seems to go on forever.

508
00:58:56,334 --> 00:59:01,362
People respect hate.
It speaks, it vibrates.

509
00:59:02,574 --> 00:59:04,371
Hey, man, let me help you up.

510
00:59:12,014 --> 00:59:17,691
Some people don't even
need a gun to hurt you.
They use words or laughter or enjoy
watching you bleed to death.

511
00:59:17,854 --> 00:59:19,333
You look like a trash can.

512
00:59:19,494 --> 00:59:26,127
They get off on watching you
fighting back the tears
getting a lump in your throat,
blushing, wanting to cry.

513
00:59:26,294 --> 00:59:30,970
And they give you a name.
Trashcan...pizza face...
loser...faggot.

514
00:59:31,134 --> 00:59:33,853
Loser... weirdo...
spaz... retard...

515
00:59:34,014 --> 00:59:38,087
You know, the name does something to you.
It changes who you are.
It alters your molecules.

516
00:59:38,414 --> 00:59:41,008
And one day you wake up

517
00:59:41,174 --> 00:59:43,210
and you look in the mirror
and you don't reconize you anymore

518
00:59:43,374 --> 00:59:47,811
because... you believe them.

519
00:59:48,014 --> 00:59:50,323
They win, you lose.

520
00:59:50,494 --> 00:59:52,610
You want to cry, please leave me alone
but nobody's listening.

521
00:59:52,774 --> 00:59:54,526
Because nobody cares.

522
00:59:54,694 --> 00:59:56,889
Because you don't have a name anymore.
Because they took it away.

523
00:59:57,094 --> 00:59:59,483
And then one day, they say that name.

524
00:59:59,654 --> 01:00:01,485
And you hear something go snap.

525
01:00:01,654 --> 01:00:03,406
Hey, Trashcan.

526
01:00:03,574 --> 01:00:05,451
You realize what you got to do.

527
01:00:05,614 --> 01:00:06,967
You got to take back your name.

528
01:00:07,134 --> 01:00:11,047
And you've got to do it in
front of the whole school,
because that's where they took
your name away from you.

529
01:00:11,254 --> 01:00:14,405
You've got to do it so every kid...

530
01:00:14,574 --> 01:00:16,963
will remember.This is about justice

531
01:00:17,134 --> 01:00:18,852
And after a while, you can
only think of one way

532
01:00:19,854 --> 01:00:21,287
Jonesboro...Springfield...

533
01:00:21,494 --> 01:00:23,803
Paducah...Columbine...

534
01:00:27,054 --> 01:00:29,010
A gun, a bomb

535
01:00:29,174 --> 01:00:32,211
Instant justice.

536
01:00:32,374 --> 01:00:38,290
But what rush when they roll out
that yellow tape
Miles and miles of yellow tape

537
01:00:38,454 --> 01:00:41,810
They won't have enough when I'm finished.

538
01:00:41,974 --> 01:00:46,286
So when these hallways are
flooded with rivers of blood

539
01:00:46,454 --> 01:00:50,970
when these hallways are choked
with their corpses and body bags...

540
01:00:51,134 --> 01:00:55,207
You will all say:
"Oh, what a tragedy."

541
01:00:55,374 --> 01:01:00,164
But possibly after viewing my tapes,
You won't be so quick to judge.

542
01:01:00,334 --> 01:01:04,805
Maybe that's why I was put on this earth.
So consider this my last will and testament.

543
01:01:04,974 --> 01:01:07,727
Okay, let's stop, please.

544
01:01:16,254 --> 01:01:19,485
Mr. Duncan
who do you want to call in there?

545
01:01:27,054 --> 01:01:29,249
- What the hell?
- I don't know.

546
01:01:29,414 --> 01:01:31,974
- It's totally ridiculous.
- It's bullshit.

547
01:01:32,134 --> 01:01:34,602
I think Meyer wants me.

548
01:01:55,054 --> 01:01:58,569
- Everybody gets teased.
- Verbally or physically?

549
01:01:58,734 --> 01:02:00,690
Even among friends?

550
01:02:02,134 --> 01:02:06,093
- I don't know.Things happen.
- What things?

551
01:02:07,414 --> 01:02:10,929
You know,horsing around.

552
01:02:12,374 --> 01:02:16,413
- Yeah, everybody horses around.
It's a pecking order.
- It's a part of school.

553
01:02:16,574 --> 01:02:20,249
- Did you ever hurt anyone?
- No.
- No way.

554
01:02:20,414 --> 01:02:25,772
What if I said we have videotapes
of you slamming kids into lockers,
and shoving their heads into toilets
among other things?

555
01:02:28,574 --> 01:02:33,250
Mark,why is there animosity between
the football team and Trevor?

556
01:02:35,534 --> 01:02:40,164
- I think it started when he got
trash canned.
- Explain yourself, please.

557
01:02:40,334 --> 01:02:45,283
Last year there was this spontaneous
pep rally in the cafeteria.

558
01:02:45,454 --> 01:02:49,447
We had a shot at the state championship
so we wanted everyone to come to the game.

559
01:02:49,614 --> 01:02:52,003
Adrenaline was high.

560
01:03:30,654 --> 01:03:36,411
And what would you say, Mark,
if I told you ever since that day
Trevor's life has been a living hell?

561
01:03:36,574 --> 01:03:41,728
I'd say that I feel pretty bad.
But I can't say I understand
why he feels that way.

562
01:03:41,894 --> 01:03:47,491
We never intended to hurt anyone.
When an upper classmen trash canned me, yeah,
it was embarrassing and humiliating,

563
01:03:47,654 --> 01:03:51,010
but it teaches you to get over stuff
and I don't think that's a bad thing.

564
01:03:51,174 --> 01:03:55,611
- Who helped you trash can Trevor?
- I'd rather not say.

565
01:03:55,774 --> 01:03:58,925
But I'll take all responsibility.

566
01:04:00,334 --> 01:04:05,408
- I'm sorry.I really am.
- Dude, don't apologize to him.

567
01:04:05,574 --> 01:04:09,965
It was me.In fact, it was my idea.
We've all been trash canned.

568
01:04:10,134 --> 01:04:13,968
None of us threatened to blow up
the school because of it
except for the terrorist over there.

569
01:04:14,134 --> 01:04:17,763
- Brad, cool it.
- But he is a terrorist.
What has he done for this school?

570
01:04:17,934 --> 01:04:23,770
We try to bring a little glory to Riverdale and
the terrorist just ruin our reputation.
Nobody should be apologizing to him.

571
01:04:23,934 --> 01:04:28,769
He's dangerous and he doesn't
belong in this school.
So don't make us the bad guys.

572
01:04:28,934 --> 01:04:36,204
Yeah, he's dangerous to the status quo
of a school that cares more about kids
who make touchdowns and slam dunks...

573
01:04:36,374 --> 01:04:39,411
than kids who are just trying
to make it through the day.

574
01:04:39,574 --> 01:04:44,523
I think that Trevor puts on a dangerous act
so that kids will leave him alone.

575
01:04:46,294 --> 01:04:52,449
Gentlemen, I will see you all in my office
after school to discuss suspension
and possible expulsion.

576
01:04:53,574 --> 01:04:59,683
Mr. Duncan, I apologize for not hearing you.
However, that video is what it is.

577
01:05:02,134 --> 01:05:07,128
Trevor,today you have forced us to take
a long hard look at our school.

578
01:05:07,294 --> 01:05:13,210
That does not excuse the fact
that you made a dead threat
which trigger our zero tolerance policy.

579
01:05:13,374 --> 01:05:20,246
I have no choice but to expel you
and you should expect a mandatory
psychiatric evaluation.

580
01:05:20,414 --> 01:05:26,649
Mr. and Mrs. Adams.
I'm sure that police chief McGee will
agree with me that because of the use
of the gun your son will require a lawyer.

581
01:05:27,694 --> 01:05:32,722
On a more personal note, this is the
most difficult decision I have ever
had to make in school.

582
01:06:20,654 --> 01:06:25,444
I'm going to get a book from my locker
and I'm going to walk home, okay?

583
01:06:37,414 --> 01:06:40,008
See you at rehearsal?

584
01:07:03,494 --> 01:07:05,166
Jump in.

585
01:07:05,334 --> 01:07:07,689
What happened?

586
01:07:17,094 --> 01:07:21,167
We've got to get the hardware
pass the metal detectors.

587
01:07:21,334 --> 01:07:25,691
Tomorrow we hide the guns in backpacks
in the trees behind the school.

588
01:07:25,854 --> 01:07:31,611
Lunchtime, Zach, clog up the men's room toilet.
Go get the janitor and bring him there.

589
01:07:35,614 --> 01:07:39,084
- Then we come in.
- Ski masks, right?

590
01:07:39,254 --> 01:07:44,453
No, I want them to see my face.
Trevor's going to get our story.

591
01:07:44,614 --> 01:07:47,811
Trevor, you're going to tell our story.
Make sure they don't suppress it.

592
01:07:47,974 --> 01:07:53,048
Kurt, you go to the janitor's room,
through the janitor's room
to the boiler room.

593
01:07:53,214 --> 01:07:57,093
There's a door to the outside.
Then you let me in.

594
01:07:59,614 --> 01:08:01,366
Kurt?

595
01:08:04,894 --> 01:08:07,169
Here, take them.
Go. Run.

596
01:08:10,294 --> 01:08:14,173
Run!
You should be in the kitchen by now.

597
01:08:17,174 --> 01:08:18,368
Go!

598
01:08:55,534 --> 01:08:57,889
Mom.Dad.

599
01:09:01,654 --> 01:09:05,203
They're going to drag you through
the mud for this.

600
01:09:06,134 --> 01:09:08,602
You've been great.

601
01:09:09,294 --> 01:09:12,491
But, uh,this is the only way out now.

602
01:09:15,894 --> 01:09:21,332
We just want for you to understand that
we couldn't let them keep doing that shit
to us anymore.

603
01:09:24,774 --> 01:09:30,531
Mom, you almost caught me last week when you saw
the gun handle sticking out of my backpack.

604
01:09:30,694 --> 01:09:35,768
You believed me when I told you
it was a paintball gun.
I'm sorry.

605
01:09:36,854 --> 01:09:41,450
Dad, What can I say?

606
01:09:41,614 --> 01:09:45,323
You said I couldn't do anything right.

607
01:09:46,374 --> 01:09:48,410
Just watch the news tomorrow.

608
01:09:48,574 --> 01:09:53,602
Hey, ma. You won't have to put up with
my yelling at you anymore.

609
01:09:53,774 --> 01:09:59,690
Finally have peace and quiet and dad,
wherever you are

610
01:10:00,734 --> 01:10:04,773
I only regret I can't deliver the bullet
with your name on it.

611
01:10:04,934 --> 01:10:08,051
And we've decided by unanimous vote that
we're not going to surrender ourselves.

612
01:10:08,214 --> 01:10:13,368
- Swat team has no choice
but shoot to kill.
- Nice three clean shots.

613
01:10:13,534 --> 01:10:17,527
- I don't want to ever face my parents.
- After tomorrow

614
01:10:17,694 --> 01:10:20,891
kids are going to watch what they say.

615
01:10:21,054 --> 01:10:25,764
They're going to watch
who they push around.

616
01:10:26,974 --> 01:10:29,613
I love you, mom and dad.

617
01:10:29,774 --> 01:10:33,483
They are going to make movies about us.

618
01:10:33,654 --> 01:10:35,724
That's it.

619
01:10:43,454 --> 01:10:48,084
- Hey, it's me.Am I calling too late?
- Yeah.Kind of.

620
01:10:50,134 --> 01:10:53,968
- Mr. D. had to cancel rehearsal today.
Where were you?
- I had a little problem.

621
01:10:54,134 --> 01:10:58,093
- Well, you should have called.
- Want to skip school with me tomorrow?

622
01:10:58,254 --> 01:11:03,772
Skip school?I don't skip school.
I have a test tomorrow.I have class.

623
01:11:03,934 --> 01:11:07,609
- We have rehearsal.
- Yeah, but I thought we could do something
or go somewhere.

624
01:11:07,774 --> 01:11:12,165
What's wrong?
I mean, besides everything?

625
01:11:12,334 --> 01:11:15,451
- I just want to see you tomorrow.
- What, like a date?

626
01:11:15,614 --> 01:11:18,686
- Skip school.
- Let's do something this weekend.

627
01:11:18,854 --> 01:11:21,926
Jenny? Who's calling so late?

628
01:11:33,974 --> 01:11:37,933
Jenny,you got to get out of here.
We got to get out of here!

629
01:12:36,814 --> 01:12:39,487
- What are you doing here?
- Can we talk?
- Yeah, sure.
- Outside?

630
01:12:39,654 --> 01:12:43,488
- Well, why don't we just talk here?
- Outside, outside, outside.

631
01:12:43,654 --> 01:12:47,203
Why do to got outside?
Are you okay?

632
01:12:52,174 --> 01:12:54,369
Go, go, go, go, go.

633
01:13:11,014 --> 01:13:16,134
- What are you doing here?
- We have to talk.

634
01:13:16,294 --> 01:13:20,003
We'll talk at rehearsal, okay?
Good-bye.

635
01:13:24,974 --> 01:13:28,125
- Can you get everybody out of here?
- What are you talking about?

636
01:13:38,174 --> 01:13:42,133
- What are you talking about, Trevor?
- Guns.Troggs with guns.

637
01:13:56,374 --> 01:14:00,731
Everybody, everybody!
May I have your attention please?
I need an emergency exit right now.

638
01:14:11,654 --> 01:14:14,930
Whoever is holding this door,
let go or you're dead.

639
01:14:19,814 --> 01:14:22,169
- What's holding the door?
- Me.

640
01:14:25,294 --> 01:14:27,489
What are you doing?
Let go, you...!

641
01:14:29,174 --> 01:14:32,371
Let's go!
I need an emergency exit right now!

642
01:14:38,254 --> 01:14:43,726
- What the hell are you doing?Let go!
- Sean, you got to give it up.
Sean, please put the guns down.

643
01:14:43,894 --> 01:14:48,763
Sean, put down the guns and listen to me!

644
01:14:56,814 --> 01:14:59,772
Sean, please, put the guns down.

645
01:15:08,494 --> 01:15:12,089
- Gun's down.
- Guns are down?

646
01:15:13,174 --> 01:15:15,813
They're down so open the door.

647
01:15:23,534 --> 01:15:25,286
Move.

648
01:15:27,294 --> 01:15:30,172
- I can't.
- I will.

649
01:15:31,334 --> 01:15:36,124
- You helped me when I was down.
I'm just returning the favor, Sean.
- You're not doing me any favors.

650
01:15:36,294 --> 01:15:38,728
You're blowing the whole thing.

651
01:15:38,894 --> 01:15:41,454
You deserve better than this.

652
01:15:41,614 --> 01:15:46,608
Trev, move.
I'm going to shoot you.
I swear to God I will.

653
01:15:46,774 --> 01:15:48,810
Cafeteria's empty.

654
01:15:50,054 --> 01:15:52,204
Everyone's gone.

655
01:16:19,014 --> 01:16:20,766
I got it. I got it.

656
01:16:27,854 --> 01:16:30,493
I'm in so much trouble.

657
01:16:32,134 --> 01:16:34,329
I'm in trouble with you.

658
01:16:45,494 --> 01:16:47,325
Who's there?

659
01:16:49,374 --> 01:16:53,208
Why me?
Why'd you kill me?

660
01:16:53,374 --> 01:16:56,207
Well, it was more fun than
dropping dudes in a video game.

661
01:16:56,374 --> 01:17:02,165
- Why me, Josh?
- Why not? World's overpopulated.
I wanted to do my part.

662
01:17:02,334 --> 01:17:05,326
- But you liked me.
- Once upon a time.

663
01:17:05,494 --> 01:17:09,373
- Why'd you kill me?
- I felt like it, okay?

664
01:17:09,534 --> 01:17:13,163
- Why me? I don't even know you.
- Wrong place, wrong time.

665
01:17:13,334 --> 01:17:15,723
Why me?
Everybody's got to die sometime, right?

666
01:17:15,894 --> 01:17:21,526
Why me?
I hope I didn't disappoint you
in the cafeteria this morning, Josh.

667
01:17:21,694 --> 01:17:25,607
I hope I died just right for you.

668
01:17:25,774 --> 01:17:31,053
Some lawyer's going to get me off.
By the time I'm 18, this whole thing
is going to be off my record.

669
01:17:31,214 --> 01:17:36,334
- You're all just a bad dream.
- Sometimes bad dreams come true.

670
01:17:53,574 --> 01:17:57,408
- What do you want from me?!
- We really need some answers, Josh.

671
01:17:57,574 --> 01:18:02,489
- Katie, we could go out this coming weekend.
- I don't think we should see each other anymore.

672
01:18:02,654 --> 01:18:05,930
- Would you give me a second chance?
- I like somebody else now.

673
01:18:06,094 --> 01:18:09,450
Sorry I'm late.
Oh. Hey, Josh.

674
01:18:10,894 --> 01:18:15,684
Him? It's him?
I thought we were friends.

675
01:18:15,854 --> 01:18:17,890
Can't we just go?

676
01:18:33,134 --> 01:18:35,694
Every... body...

677
01:18:37,454 --> 01:18:41,049
in... this...class...

678
01:18:41,214 --> 01:18:44,286
is... dead...

679
01:18:47,854 --> 01:18:50,004
meat.

680
01:18:56,134 --> 01:19:01,367
We compared the writing on the blackboard
to your last essay in english class.
It was a perfect match.

681
01:19:01,534 --> 01:19:05,607
Our zero tolerance policy gives me no choice
but to expel you for the rest of the year.

682
01:19:05,774 --> 01:19:10,973
So because of some stupid words
written on the blackboard,
I have to repeat the grade?

683
01:19:11,134 --> 01:19:14,649
I won't go.I won't go!

684
01:19:14,814 --> 01:19:17,726
Dat doe ik niet. Vergeet het maar.

685
01:19:20,574 --> 01:19:22,007
You will go.

686
01:19:22,174 --> 01:19:25,962
Sit in a hot class while other kids
get to do what they like?
Study on summer nights?

687
01:19:26,134 --> 01:19:30,286
- You should have thought about that
before you wrote on the blackboard.
- I'd rather be dead.
- You don't really mean that.

688
01:19:30,454 --> 01:19:35,050
- You'll see.I'm pushed to my limits.
- I think you should calm down.

689
01:19:35,214 --> 01:19:39,651
You know what? I hate you both.
And I wish you'd both die so I wouldn't
have to look at you anymore.

690
01:19:39,814 --> 01:19:44,330
We tried to give you a good life, Josh,
but all we did was feed your appetites!

691
01:19:44,494 --> 01:19:47,850
And starting tomorrow, you have an appointment
with a psychotherapist!

692
01:19:57,894 --> 01:20:03,491
Mom,Dad,You made me kill you.

693
01:20:05,054 --> 01:20:08,330
I wanted to kill you,
but I didn't want you dead.

694
01:20:08,494 --> 01:20:15,013
I mean, how else can I tell you what's on my mind
without you interrupting all the time?

695
01:20:15,174 --> 01:20:19,804
I mean, you don't know
how hard it is to be no one.

696
01:20:19,974 --> 01:20:22,363
Where do I fit in?

697
01:20:22,534 --> 01:20:27,403
Mom, where do I fit in?
Where can I go where nobody's on my back?

698
01:20:27,574 --> 01:20:32,125
I go to school and the teachers give me
this test and that paper,and "do this"
and "don't do that"

699
01:20:32,294 --> 01:20:37,732
and then I come home,and there's always
something I didn't do.
And I'm never good enough.

700
01:20:37,894 --> 01:20:43,332
I'm guess I'm just sick of you
being disappointed all the time.

701
01:20:45,614 --> 01:20:51,564
Dad, do you remember when you bought
me the outfielder's glove and I caught
that high fly in the little league championships

702
01:20:51,734 --> 01:20:54,487
and you carried me off on your shoulders?

703
01:20:56,254 --> 01:20:58,848
Why can't it be more like that?

704
01:20:59,014 --> 01:21:01,767
Why is it so easy to talk to you now?

705
01:21:20,734 --> 01:21:24,727
- Why'd you shoot me through the heart?
- Where do you think you shot me?

706
01:21:24,894 --> 01:21:28,933
I hate it when you pretend
that I'm not there.

707
01:21:29,094 --> 01:21:32,245
My parents don't see me.

708
01:21:32,414 --> 01:21:37,568
Kids in school don't see me.
It's like I'm invisible.

709
01:21:37,734 --> 01:21:40,771
- Why'd you shoot me through the head?
- Well, you should have thought of that
when you pushed me.

710
01:21:40,934 --> 01:21:45,849
- Why me in the stomach?
- I had my whole life ahead of me.

711
01:21:47,614 --> 01:21:51,493
- So did I.
- I've been taught that forgiveness
is for the forgiver.

712
01:21:51,654 --> 01:21:55,169
but I can't forgive you until I know
what was really in your heart, Josh.

713
01:21:55,334 --> 01:21:58,167
We want to hear you say it to yourself.

714
01:21:59,214 --> 01:22:04,083
Sometimes I hate being alive but
I'm too afraid to be dead.

715
01:22:04,254 --> 01:22:07,246
You know what I hate about being dead?
You can't call up and order pizza.

716
01:22:07,414 --> 01:22:10,850
I miss lying on my bed in the dark and
falling asleep to a new cd.

717
01:22:11,014 --> 01:22:18,364
- Yeah, I miss getting shot down by girls.
- I miss when a guy gets that look in his eye and
you know he's going to ask you out.

718
01:22:18,534 --> 01:22:21,810
- I miss my mom's rock-hard brownies.
- I miss my dog when I come home from school.

719
01:22:21,974 --> 01:22:27,412
- I miss caffeine, you know?
- I miss when I take a new pair of jeans
into the dressing room and I try them on
and they fit perfect.

720
01:22:27,574 --> 01:22:32,489
- I miss when you start school and you open
a book and the spine cracks.
- I miss laughing so hard
that I start to cry.

721
01:22:32,654 --> 01:22:39,127
- I miss screaming at fooball games.
- I miss being home alone with a microwave bag
of popcorn and the remote control in one hand
and channel surfing.

722
01:22:39,294 --> 01:22:43,412
- I miss my bed.
- Singing in the shower.
- I miss getting into a fight with my brother and then
acting like nothing happened 5 minutes later.

723
01:22:43,574 --> 01:22:48,489
- I miss making my mom laugh so hard
she can hardly breathe.
- I miss watching the sky go from light to dark.

724
01:22:48,654 --> 01:22:50,292
And dark to light.

725
01:22:51,134 --> 01:22:57,812
I never thought I was taking away all of that.
In the back of my mind,
I thought it was a video game.

726
01:22:57,974 --> 01:23:01,683
- I could just press the re-start button.
- What do you know about never?

727
01:23:01,854 --> 01:23:06,052
- I'll never do all that I wanted to do.
- I"ll never see all I wanted to see.
- I'll never know all I wanted to know.

728
01:23:06,214 --> 01:23:11,527
- I'll never have a chance to star on Broadway.
- I'll never make my father proud of me.
- I'll never find out if that psychic was right.
- I'll never see Paris.

729
01:23:11,694 --> 01:23:16,245
I'll never know what it is to come home
from work and have all my kids pull me down
with their hugs and kisses.

730
01:23:16,414 --> 01:23:20,771
- I'll never be married.
- And give love.
- And get love.
- And have a rich, full life.

731
01:23:23,534 --> 01:23:28,892
What do you want from me?
I can't bring you back to life.
It's over.

732
01:23:29,054 --> 01:23:33,684
- Over for us, Josh.
- But just the beginning for you.

733
01:23:33,854 --> 01:23:38,450
- For the rest of your life you'll have us
in your head until you're dead.
- And you'll see us over
- And over
- Again

734
01:23:38,614 --> 01:23:42,243
As you saw us this afternoon
in the school cafeteria.

735
01:23:44,894 --> 01:23:47,647
Dead.

736
01:23:59,814 --> 01:24:02,567
I didn't know it was going to be forever.

737
01:24:05,214 --> 01:24:10,413
I thought it was just
Bang, bang, you're dead again.

738
01:24:12,374 --> 01:24:17,402
When I killed you.
I killed all my possibilities.

739
01:24:22,094 --> 01:24:26,485
I will never have anything
to look forward to.

740
01:24:30,814 --> 01:24:32,566
Never.
