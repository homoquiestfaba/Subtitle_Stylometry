00:33:29,307 --> 00:33:31,207
No.

Oh! Oh! Oh!
[ Giggles ]

513
00:33:33,311 --> 00:33:35,370
Right. Uh, excuse me.

- [ Grunting ]
- Bye.

515
00:33:40,852 --> 00:33:44,720
Mm-mm-mmm! Maybe they should call
this place ''Chel Dorado.''

516
00:33:44,822 --> 00:33:47,848
[ Chuckles ]
She's whoo--

517
00:33:47,959 --> 00:33:50,052
- Whoa, she's trouble! Wait a minute!
- What?

The little voice--
Remember the little voice?

imagine thatyou have one.

520
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:58,194
What would it be saying about Chel?

521
00:33:59,337 --> 00:34:02,204
- [ Purrs ]
- No. No. Listen.

522
00:34:02,306 --> 00:34:04,206
- We are partners.
- We are partners.

523
00:34:04,308 --> 00:34:08,039
- We have a plan, remember?
- Get the gold. Go back to Spain.

524
00:34:08,146 --> 00:34:11,309
Yes! And we are
pretending to be gods.

525
00:34:11,416 --> 00:34:14,385
Now, put Chel in the mix.
What is the voice saying?

526
00:34:14,485 --> 00:34:18,080
- Listen carefully.
- [ Gasps ]

527
00:34:18,189 --> 00:34:23,525
- Chel is off-limits, hmm?
- Bravo! Chel is off-limits!

528
00:34:23,628 --> 00:34:25,528
Shake on it.

529
00:34:25,630 --> 00:34:28,428
- Off-limits. Mm. Mm.
- [ Both ] Mmmm.

530
00:34:28,533 --> 00:34:30,865
Besides, we're supposed to be gods.

531
00:34:30,968 --> 00:34:33,061
We must avoid
giving in to temptation.

532
00:34:33,171 --> 00:34:39,007
- Gods. Oh. This is
gonna be tougher than I thought.
- Tulio, relax!

533
00:34:39,110 --> 00:34:43,706
All you have to do is smile,
act godly and follow my lead.

A-one, two, three.

537
00:34:56,594 --> 00:35:00,496
I hardly think I'm qualified

538
00:35:00,598 --> 00:35:03,396
To come across all sanctified

539
00:35:03,501 --> 00:35:07,369
I just don't cut it
with the cherubim

540
00:35:07,472 --> 00:35:10,066
- [ Groaning ]
- Tulio, what areyou talking about?

541
00:35:10,174 --> 00:35:13,166
There again they're on their knees

542
00:35:13,277 --> 00:35:15,802
Being worshipped is a breeze

543
00:35:15,913 --> 00:35:18,541
Which rather suits us in

544
00:35:18,649 --> 00:35:22,710
- The interim
-  Interim, interim
It's me and him

545

Oh, myGod!
It's tough tobeagod

546
00:35:26,123 --> 00:35:30,150
Tread where mortals have not trod

Be the subject ofpsalms

550
00:35:42,773 --> 00:35:45,674
It's a rather touching notion

551
00:35:45,776 --> 00:35:49,007
All those prayers and those salaams

552
00:35:49,113 --> 00:35:52,378
And who am I to bridle

553
00:35:52,483 --> 00:35:54,815
IfI'm forced to be an idol

Ifthey say that I'm a god

That's what I am

- You have a point there.
Very good thinking.

- Yeah!

-  El Dorado on our plates
- Thankyou.

00:36:19,610 --> 00:36:21,737

-  Be rebuffed
-  Never rebuffed

I never rebuffa local feeling
No, my friend

00:36:27,652 --> 00:36:29,711
It's tough to be a god

00:36:29,820 --> 00:36:33,221
But ifyou get the people's nod

- That's our advice
- It's great advice!

00:36:39,797 --> 00:36:42,789
Be a symbol ofperfection

570
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:45,960
Be a legend
Be a cult

571
00:36:46,070 --> 00:36:48,800
Take their praise
Take a collection

As themultitudes exalt

Don a supernatural habit

- We'd be crazy not to grab it
- You got it!

And what have we done
to show our gratitude?

594
00:38:17,128 --> 00:38:20,256
A meager celebration.

for this tribute!

Buenos días!

Listen, all we have to do...

is keep playing
the one against the other.

654
00:42:15,065 --> 00:42:17,966
You know, do a little god dance,
chant some mystic mumbojumbo,

655
00:42:18,068 --> 00:42:20,559
dazzle 'em with some smoke and mirrors
and then get the hell back to Spain.

get all this back to Spain?

- there's your plan and then...
there's the gods' plan.
- Mm-hmm.

a horizontal pattern at first.

large and glorious enough...

671
00:43:05,649 --> 00:43:08,277
