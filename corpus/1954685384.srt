1
00:00:39,306 --> 00:00:40,740
<i>What are you doing to me?</i>

2
00:00:40,841 --> 00:00:44,141
<i>Stop! That's not part
of the initiation!</i>

3
00:00:44,678 --> 00:00:45,941
<i>God, no!</i>

4
00:00:46,981 --> 00:00:49,177
<i>Oh, my God!
What have I done?</i>

5
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:52,519
<i>Let me out of here!
Let me out of here!</i>

6
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:55,453
<i>Help me! Help me!</i>

7
00:02:46,767 --> 00:02:48,326
Anyone here?

8
00:02:50,671 --> 00:02:51,866
Guys?

9
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:08,318
I'm here for the initiation.

10
00:03:16,764 --> 00:03:19,495
You guys can do
whatever you want to me.

11
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:22,035
I'm ready for anything.

12
00:03:22,136 --> 00:03:24,867
Just don't hide and scare me.

13
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:27,708
Guys?

14
00:03:36,984 --> 00:03:38,645
Anyone home?

15
00:04:46,887 --> 00:04:48,855
You guys are watching me,
aren't you?

16
00:05:21,188 --> 00:05:24,522
All I have to do is make it
through this weekend, and I'm in.

17
00:05:24,625 --> 00:05:27,026
[Thud]

18
00:06:34,227 --> 00:06:36,195
Guys?

19
00:06:36,296 --> 00:06:40,130
[Heartbeats]

20
00:07:24,077 --> 00:07:28,036
Guys? You up there?

21
00:10:02,636 --> 00:10:06,630
[Flies buzzing]

22
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:17,593
Dude, when you said the woods,
you weren't kidding.

23
00:12:17,704 --> 00:12:19,263
Are we there yet?

24
00:12:19,372 --> 00:12:20,533
Shut up, pledges.

25
00:12:58,945 --> 00:13:00,037
So this is it?

26
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:02,812
So, where are the chicks?

27
00:13:04,284 --> 00:13:07,219
This weekend is about bonding,
Eddie, not bondage.

28
00:13:09,356 --> 00:13:10,846
Besides, you don't want any chicks

29
00:13:10,957 --> 00:13:12,857
to see what's gonna happen
to you this weekend.

30
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:15,819
This is Gamma Kappa property.

31
00:13:15,929 --> 00:13:17,021
Show some respect.

32
00:13:17,864 --> 00:13:20,424
This place has been around
for over a hundred years.

33
00:13:20,533 --> 00:13:22,558
And it'll be around
long after we're all dead.

34
00:13:23,236 --> 00:13:24,362
Sorry, master.

35
00:13:26,039 --> 00:13:27,200
Would you leave
the poor kid alone?

36
00:13:28,875 --> 00:13:30,673
You speak to me out of turn,
pledge?

37
00:13:33,747 --> 00:13:35,579
Give me 10 now.

38
00:13:57,237 --> 00:13:58,398
Sorry, Kevin.

39
00:13:59,572 --> 00:14:01,666
Don't worry, mate.

40
00:14:02,142 --> 00:14:06,511
If this thing weren't so primitive
and juvenile, I might be angry.

41
00:14:06,613 --> 00:14:09,446
Like I said,
this is Gamma Kappa property,

42
00:14:09,549 --> 00:14:10,744
which means it's home
to any member

43
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:13,148
of Gamma Kappa
right across America.

44
00:14:13,253 --> 00:14:15,119
We can't hold our initiation
at Whitman anymore

45
00:14:15,221 --> 00:14:17,952
due to some unfortunate
legal matters.

46
00:14:18,925 --> 00:14:21,758
So from now on,
initiation will take place here.

47
00:14:23,163 --> 00:14:24,927
Hey, it looks like Andy boy
beat us here.

48
00:14:26,766 --> 00:14:28,200
Hope he followed our directions.

49
00:14:28,301 --> 00:14:29,234
Me, too.

50
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:41,714
Pledge, we're here.

51
00:14:43,616 --> 00:14:44,845
Hey, Andy!

52
00:14:46,686 --> 00:14:48,586
Where the hell are you, Andy?

53
00:14:48,688 --> 00:14:50,213
Don't be afraid.

54
00:15:03,803 --> 00:15:05,897
Man, I don't know
what they're gonna do to us.

55
00:15:06,005 --> 00:15:07,268
I'm scared.

56
00:15:07,373 --> 00:15:08,499
I don't know if I can take it.

57
00:15:08,608 --> 00:15:10,906
Dude, relax.
It's only a weekend.

58
00:15:11,010 --> 00:15:12,739
What's the worst thing
they can do to us?

59
00:15:12,846 --> 00:15:15,110
Think about what being
a Gamma Kappa means.

60
00:15:15,215 --> 00:15:20,745
Better grades, better social life,
better job after graduation.

61
00:15:20,854 --> 00:15:21,912
Chicks.

62
00:15:27,293 --> 00:15:30,024
Hey.
Andy's stuff was in our room.

63
00:15:31,731 --> 00:15:34,723
I sent him up here early
to set up for initiation.

64
00:15:34,834 --> 00:15:36,359
Well, where is he?

65
00:15:36,469 --> 00:15:38,096
I'm sure he's hanging
around here somewhere.

66
00:15:49,916 --> 00:15:51,145
Why are you even
in this fraternity, man,

67
00:15:51,251 --> 00:15:52,184
if you hate these guys so much?

68
00:15:52,285 --> 00:15:54,379
[Scoffs]

69
00:15:54,487 --> 00:15:56,046
Damn legacy.

70
00:15:56,155 --> 00:15:58,351
Father founded this damn frat.

71
00:15:58,458 --> 00:16:00,222
He probably helped pay for this
little piece of lakefront property

72
00:16:00,326 --> 00:16:02,124
with his alumni donations.

73
00:16:03,196 --> 00:16:05,426
Hope they boot my ass out.

74
00:16:05,532 --> 00:16:07,967
I've heard what they do to pledges.

75
00:16:08,067 --> 00:16:10,126
I don't even know what to expect.

76
00:16:10,236 --> 00:16:12,762
Just the same
old juvenile frat stuff.

77
00:16:12,872 --> 00:16:13,600
[Chuckles]

78
00:16:13,706 --> 00:16:14,366
What are they gonna do?
Kill us?

79
00:16:16,309 --> 00:16:17,834
What's the worst
that could possibly happen?

80
00:16:51,878 --> 00:16:53,141
This is great.

81
00:17:02,088 --> 00:17:03,783
What the hell do you
think you're doing?

82
00:17:07,727 --> 00:17:09,559
I'm just looking for a room, sir.

83
00:17:12,098 --> 00:17:15,864
Boyd, house masters
get their own rooms.

84
00:17:17,737 --> 00:17:19,535
Not bitch boys like you.

85
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:23,770
I'm sorry.

86
00:17:23,876 --> 00:17:25,275
We're gonna have fun with you.

87
00:17:26,679 --> 00:17:29,671
I really am a fun guy
to have around.

88
00:17:29,782 --> 00:17:32,479
When I say fun, I mean torture.

89
00:17:32,585 --> 00:17:34,019
Get out!

90
00:17:40,493 --> 00:17:42,222
Where's the beer?

91
00:17:42,328 --> 00:17:43,659
We gotta spank that Andy kid.

92
00:17:43,763 --> 00:17:45,288
He probably forgot the beer,
and he's hiding in the woods

93
00:17:45,398 --> 00:17:47,059
'cause he's scared
of what we're gonna do to him.

94
00:17:47,166 --> 00:17:48,725
Hey, did you guys
know there's an attic?

95
00:17:48,835 --> 00:17:49,961
Of course, I knew that.

96
00:17:52,005 --> 00:17:53,837
I thought you said you've
never been here for initiation.

97
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:56,102
I'm a senior.
I know everything.

98
00:18:21,734 --> 00:18:23,930
Who owned this place before?

99
00:18:24,037 --> 00:18:25,698
It was a summer camp
back in the '80s.

100
00:18:25,805 --> 00:18:27,967
Then a lumberjack lived here
with his wife and kids.

101
00:18:28,074 --> 00:18:29,371
What happened to 'em?

102
00:18:30,677 --> 00:18:31,872
You don't wanna know.

103
00:18:38,851 --> 00:18:40,876
[Sighs]

104
00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:50,291
What the hell happened to you?

105
00:18:50,396 --> 00:18:52,023
Where are you, John?

106
00:18:55,168 --> 00:18:59,162
[Heartbeats]

107
00:19:32,839 --> 00:19:34,068
Help me.

108
00:19:35,274 --> 00:19:37,402
Please, help me.

109
00:19:43,116 --> 00:19:45,312
Man, how'd we get
this place so cheap?

110
00:19:45,418 --> 00:19:48,649
It wasn't that cheap.
But we had to have it.

111
00:19:53,059 --> 00:19:54,584
Was he up here
when he vanished?

112
00:19:55,428 --> 00:19:56,759
You know, that missing kid?

113
00:19:57,997 --> 00:20:01,023
Yeah.

114
00:20:01,134 --> 00:20:03,535
John Ralston.

115
00:20:03,636 --> 00:20:07,470
He was a dire pledge,
same as me.

116
00:20:08,474 --> 00:20:10,499
The police came by the house
again the other day.

117
00:20:12,311 --> 00:20:14,473
They think
he vanished from school.

118
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:16,070
They're still asking questions.

119
00:20:16,916 --> 00:20:18,645
Look, it was three years ago.

120
00:20:18,751 --> 00:20:22,153
I was a freshman.
We came up here for initiation.

121
00:20:22,255 --> 00:20:24,587
It was tough on him
like it was for all of us.

122
00:20:24,690 --> 00:20:25,748
And he vanished.

123
00:20:25,858 --> 00:20:28,589
We didn't kill him.
I don't know what happened to him.

124
00:20:31,531 --> 00:20:34,296
The alumni thought it'd be best
if we buy this place.

125
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,562
And we all pledged
to keep it quiet.

126
00:20:36,669 --> 00:20:39,570
And that's what
we're gonna do, okay?

127
00:20:39,672 --> 00:20:42,607
It's over.
John Ralston was never here.

128
00:20:42,708 --> 00:20:45,507
And no one at Gamma Kappa
remembers him.

129
00:20:47,847 --> 00:20:49,975
So Why'd you have
to come back, then?

130
00:20:55,588 --> 00:20:57,647
I'm sorry for my transgression
with the room.

131
00:21:01,227 --> 00:21:04,720
In every group of pledges,
there's a whipping boy.

132
00:21:04,831 --> 00:21:06,663
A Boyd.

133
00:21:06,766 --> 00:21:09,565
So, where do you
want me to sleep tonight?

134
00:21:09,669 --> 00:21:12,263
Man, Boyd, I think that you should
probably sleep out there.

135
00:21:21,180 --> 00:21:23,706
It's time to begin initiation.

136
00:21:23,816 --> 00:21:25,784
So, take off your shirts.

137
00:21:26,485 --> 00:21:27,646
And your pants.

138
00:22:10,363 --> 00:22:11,922
It's just the beginning, boys.

139
00:22:13,399 --> 00:22:15,561
First day's always a piece of cake.

140
00:22:15,668 --> 00:22:17,363
It just gets harder
and harder from here.

141
00:22:19,538 --> 00:22:20,664
How do you feel after that?

142
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:25,004
Do you feel emasculated?
Violated?

143
00:22:25,111 --> 00:22:26,374
Do you feel impotent?

144
00:22:27,513 --> 00:22:29,208
Do you still want the chicks?

145
00:22:30,816 --> 00:22:32,113
Bend over.

146
00:22:34,887 --> 00:22:35,945
NOW!

147
00:22:54,607 --> 00:22:56,132
Are we having fun yet, boys?

148
00:22:56,876 --> 00:22:59,311
Yes, sir.
May I have another?

149
00:23:00,279 --> 00:23:06,241
To be a Gamma Kappa,
you must show leadership, loyalty,

150
00:23:06,352 --> 00:23:09,583
and be willing to sacrifice
yourself to the fraternity.

151
00:23:09,689 --> 00:23:12,954
And to do that, you have to bear
the mark of Gamma Kappa

152
00:23:13,059 --> 00:23:14,356
for the rest of your days.

153
00:23:16,896 --> 00:23:18,261
You gotta be kidding me.

154
00:23:22,335 --> 00:23:25,771
I am sick of your attitude,
Mr. Trust Fund Rich Boy.

155
00:23:25,871 --> 00:23:29,364
If you're not man enough
to go through initiation, fine.

156
00:23:29,475 --> 00:23:32,843
I'll just call your daddy and tell him
his son's being a big pussy.

157
00:23:32,945 --> 00:23:36,074
Oh, wait.
Does he already know that?

158
00:23:43,189 --> 00:23:44,418
You can't break me.

159
00:23:47,059 --> 00:23:48,493
I will break you.

160
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:57,300
[Flies buzzing]

161
00:24:06,879 --> 00:24:09,211
[Screams]

162
00:24:09,315 --> 00:24:11,682
Gamma Kappa
is more than a fraternity.

163
00:24:12,551 --> 00:24:14,986
It's a way of life.

164
00:24:15,087 --> 00:24:16,020
A brotherhood.

165
00:24:19,091 --> 00:24:22,061
We must bond like brothers.

166
00:24:22,161 --> 00:24:25,358
Only way to do that
is to be blood brothers.

167
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:31,259
I hate blood.
Anything but this.

168
00:24:31,370 --> 00:24:33,338
You wanna be a Gamma Kappa?

169
00:24:33,439 --> 00:24:35,100
You can leave at anytime.

170
00:24:35,207 --> 00:24:37,505
You're all expendable.

171
00:24:43,416 --> 00:24:45,783
I'll do anything
to be a Gamma Kappa.

172
00:25:05,371 --> 00:25:07,066
[Groans]

173
00:25:17,083 --> 00:25:18,642
You dare defy me?

174
00:25:18,751 --> 00:25:21,721
I'll cut myself if you don't mind.

175
00:25:28,661 --> 00:25:32,859
Man bleeds.
Man can be killed.

176
00:25:34,366 --> 00:25:35,959
Are you guys gonna cut
yourselves now?

177
00:25:36,068 --> 00:25:38,332
[Laughs]

178
00:25:38,437 --> 00:25:42,203
Man, Boyd, I'd really love to,
but I'm a hemophiliac.

179
00:25:42,308 --> 00:25:44,470
We've already survived initiation.

180
00:25:45,377 --> 00:25:48,142
You must be willing to lay down
your lives for your fellow brothers.

181
00:25:48,247 --> 00:25:50,147
That's what brotherhood is.

182
00:25:50,249 --> 00:25:53,184
Now, slap hands
like blood brothers.

183
00:26:03,529 --> 00:26:05,497
Go gather some kindling
for a campfire.

184
00:26:06,265 --> 00:26:07,733
Go!

185
00:26:31,190 --> 00:26:33,158
Sorry, guys.
Just passing through.

186
00:26:33,259 --> 00:26:35,159
You guys should probably
put on some clothes.

187
00:26:35,261 --> 00:26:37,491
This is bear country.
They'd like you.

188
00:26:37,596 --> 00:26:45,435
I'm Kevin. This is Boyd.
Doug. Eddie. And Garrett.

189
00:26:45,538 --> 00:26:46,937
Tatianna.

190
00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:48,370
So what are you guys
doing out here?

191
00:26:48,474 --> 00:26:50,602
Oh, we're with Gamma Kappa
fraternity.

192
00:26:50,709 --> 00:26:51,938
This is initiation.

193
00:26:52,044 --> 00:26:53,102
Don't apologize.

194
00:26:53,212 --> 00:26:57,171
This is Gamma Kappa property,
and you're trespassing.

195
00:26:58,851 --> 00:26:59,784
Well, be careful.

196
00:26:59,885 --> 00:27:02,183
I've been hiking around this area
for 10 years now,

197
00:27:02,288 --> 00:27:05,019
and you can really get hurt
if you don't know what you're doing.

198
00:27:20,739 --> 00:27:23,902
There's a girl in the woods.

199
00:27:24,009 --> 00:27:26,910
Actually, she was kind of hot.

200
00:27:40,659 --> 00:27:42,787
Hey.

201
00:27:42,895 --> 00:27:43,521
Where's your car?

202
00:27:43,629 --> 00:27:45,324
I just took the bike up here.

203
00:27:45,431 --> 00:27:47,126
You must have strong legs.

204
00:27:47,233 --> 00:27:49,099
Morris, how long
is this going on for?

205
00:27:49,201 --> 00:27:52,762
Tomorrow. Just do what I ask.
It's initiation week, you know.

206
00:27:52,871 --> 00:27:54,805
You wanna be
Gamma Kappa, right?

207
00:27:54,907 --> 00:27:58,571
Aren't you sick of babysitting
to pay tuition?

208
00:28:04,016 --> 00:28:06,644
Your next task
is a scavenger hunt.

209
00:28:06,752 --> 00:28:10,154
There are ribbons hung
in certain trees in the woods.

210
00:28:10,256 --> 00:28:11,052
You must find a ribbon

211
00:28:11,156 --> 00:28:13,716
if you want to eat or sleep
in a cabin tonight.

212
00:28:13,826 --> 00:28:18,889
And if you find a ribbon,
you can sleep in a cabin, too.

213
00:28:18,998 --> 00:28:22,730
Wait. We can't do it like this.
This is bear country.

214
00:28:22,835 --> 00:28:27,739
Oh, yeah. And watch out
for the bears... or you're lunch.

215
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:29,501
[Blows whistle]

216
00:29:02,508 --> 00:29:04,033
Stop playing around.
Where's Andy?

217
00:29:04,143 --> 00:29:05,201
I don't know. You tell me.

218
00:29:05,311 --> 00:29:07,006
Maybe he's in the lake.

219
00:29:07,112 --> 00:29:09,547
Maybe he's still finishing
his scavenger hunt.

220
00:29:09,648 --> 00:29:11,776
I hope so.

221
00:29:13,252 --> 00:29:15,687
This is gonna be the best initiation
we've ever had.

222
00:29:15,788 --> 00:29:20,885
Oh, yeah, as long as no pledges
disappear without a trace.

223
00:29:23,262 --> 00:29:25,094
We don't have a problem, do we?

224
00:29:26,298 --> 00:29:30,292
I don't know, Morris.
Why'd you come back up here?

225
00:29:36,275 --> 00:29:40,542
Well, we're barred
from using the school. And --

226
00:29:40,646 --> 00:29:43,445
And you wanna find the missing
pledge, right? That's it.

227
00:29:43,549 --> 00:29:45,916
John Ralston?

228
00:29:46,018 --> 00:29:48,180
You know, why didn't you just
come up here by yourself?

229
00:29:48,287 --> 00:29:49,721
Because this place is creepy.

230
00:29:49,822 --> 00:29:52,848
Don't you think? I mean, that's
why it's perfect for initiation.

231
00:29:54,193 --> 00:29:59,256
Look, I --
We didn't kill that pledge, okay?

232
00:30:00,599 --> 00:30:04,092
Do you really think I'm capable
of murdering a pledge?

233
00:30:16,915 --> 00:30:17,882
[Exhales]

234
00:30:17,983 --> 00:30:19,678
Hey, where are they?

235
00:30:19,785 --> 00:30:21,981
This sucks.

236
00:30:56,655 --> 00:30:57,850
I found a ribbon.

237
00:30:57,956 --> 00:31:00,152
I found a ribbon!
I found a ribbon!

238
00:31:00,259 --> 00:31:02,091
I did good.

239
00:31:11,203 --> 00:31:15,231
Guys? Where are you?

240
00:31:19,978 --> 00:31:22,504
I think I'm lost!

241
00:31:25,350 --> 00:31:27,375
I think I'm lost.

242
00:31:29,721 --> 00:31:32,156
Boyd!

243
00:31:32,257 --> 00:31:34,919
I guess he's the only one
who found a ribbon.

244
00:31:35,027 --> 00:31:36,995
Looks like he's not staying
out here tonight.

245
00:31:37,095 --> 00:31:39,325
Boyd'll never survive
out here all weekend.

246
00:31:39,431 --> 00:31:42,093
We have to find him and get him out
of here before he gets himself hurt.

247
00:31:44,036 --> 00:31:45,060
Where the hell were you, Boyd?

248
00:31:45,571 --> 00:31:47,437
I found a ribbon.
I passed the test.

249
00:31:57,049 --> 00:31:59,279
Did you check to see
if all the ribbons were out there?

250
00:31:59,384 --> 00:32:02,445
That was Andy's job.
I gave him detailed instructions.

251
00:32:07,326 --> 00:32:08,760
Hope you guys
found all the ribbons.

252
00:32:08,861 --> 00:32:10,761
We didn't find any
'cause there were none.

253
00:32:11,663 --> 00:32:13,893
Well, actually, Boyd yelled out
and said he found one.

254
00:32:13,999 --> 00:32:15,865
We didn't find any, though.

255
00:32:17,803 --> 00:32:20,738
Out of all the pledges,
you're the only one to find a ribbon?

256
00:32:20,839 --> 00:32:23,308
I found the ribbon.
I passed the test.

257
00:32:24,810 --> 00:32:26,175
What'd you do,
kill someone to get it?

258
00:32:28,580 --> 00:32:31,606
You guys are gonna have
to repeat this test tomorrow.

259
00:32:31,717 --> 00:32:33,344
[sighing]

260
00:32:36,488 --> 00:32:38,013
Go.

261
00:32:38,123 --> 00:32:39,989
Go!

[Birds chirping]

263
00:33:03,916 --> 00:33:05,042
Has anyone seen Andy?

264
00:33:10,088 --> 00:33:12,750
Don't tell me he's still playing
hide-and-seek.

265
00:33:12,858 --> 00:33:17,420
He didn't put the ribbons
on the trees. He's gone.

266
00:33:20,799 --> 00:33:22,767
Where is he?

267
00:33:22,868 --> 00:33:23,733
I don't know, man.

268
00:33:23,835 --> 00:33:26,827
Maybe the pledges are playing
a trick of their own on us.

269
00:33:26,939 --> 00:33:30,273
No. That would
require imagination.

270
00:33:30,375 --> 00:33:33,572
Hey, we were pledges, too, once.
We were just like them.

271
00:33:34,346 --> 00:33:37,077
No. I was never like them.

272
00:33:38,216 --> 00:33:40,378
Come on. Where is he?

273
00:33:40,485 --> 00:33:43,216
I don't know, okay?

274
00:33:43,322 --> 00:33:45,450
You never know with you.

275
00:33:46,158 --> 00:33:48,991
Did you guys know that this place,
Lake Matawaska,

276
00:33:49,094 --> 00:33:50,323
has a bloody legend?

277
00:33:50,429 --> 00:33:52,955
A pledge vanished
a couple years back.

278
00:33:53,065 --> 00:33:54,191
What I was gonna say

279
00:33:54,299 --> 00:33:57,496
is that the lumberjack
who built this place

280
00:33:57,603 --> 00:34:00,004
went mad and chopped his wife
and kids to pieces.

281
00:34:00,105 --> 00:34:01,197
Would you believe that?

282
00:34:12,250 --> 00:34:14,218
Go in and get cleaned up
for tomorrow.

283
00:34:14,319 --> 00:34:16,447
It's gonna be hell day.
You're gonna need rest.

284
00:34:25,530 --> 00:34:28,261
Sorry, man. It just slipped.

285
00:34:28,367 --> 00:34:29,630
Do you know what happens

286
00:34:29,735 --> 00:34:32,602
if the cops find out that kid
was up here when he vanished?

287
00:34:32,704 --> 00:34:34,194
It's been three years,

288
00:34:34,306 --> 00:34:35,796
and everyone
thinks he left for school

289
00:34:35,907 --> 00:34:38,774
or went to Europe
or has been kidnapped.

290
00:34:38,877 --> 00:34:42,108
We made a vow of silence.
Do you wanna go to jail?

291
00:34:42,214 --> 00:34:44,342
I wouldn't really
go to jail now, would I?

00:39:28,767 --> 00:39:30,360
I'm joking. I love you.

353
00:39:30,468 --> 00:39:32,232
<i>- Love you, too.
- I'll see you</i> on <i>Monday.</i>

354
00:39:32,337 --> 00:39:33,566
- Okay.
-Love you.

355
00:39:33,672 --> 00:39:36,039
- Bye.
- Bye.

356
00:39:48,153 --> 00:39:51,088
You know,
they have pills for that.

357
00:39:51,189 --> 00:39:54,386
What are you talking about?

358
00:39:54,492 --> 00:39:56,483
[Tatianna sighs]

359
00:40:00,432 --> 00:40:02,560
[indistinct chatter]

360
00:40:13,578 --> 00:40:14,807
Trash.

361
00:40:14,913 --> 00:40:17,848
[Cheers and applause]

362
00:40:20,051 --> 00:40:22,782
I am out of here, Morris.

363
00:40:37,669 --> 00:40:41,833
[Heartbeats]

364
00:40:59,024 --> 00:41:00,958
Guys?

365
00:41:04,429 --> 00:41:06,363
I hid the ribbons!

366
00:41:06,464 --> 00:41:08,933
I hid 'em really well.

367
00:41:09,034 --> 00:41:12,004
I went all over the forest.

368
00:41:12,771 --> 00:41:13,829
[Sighs]

369
00:41:14,906 --> 00:41:17,136
God...

370
00:41:17,242 --> 00:41:19,939
It's freezing out here.

371
00:41:47,572 --> 00:41:49,267
[Screams]

372
00:41:50,608 --> 00:41:53,270
[Tatianna continues screaming]

373
00:42:03,655 --> 00:42:06,090
What are you doing here?

374
00:42:06,191 --> 00:42:07,716
Is this a joke?

375
00:43:54,132 --> 00:43:56,066
The first day wasn't so bad.

376
00:43:56,167 --> 00:43:58,864
I've been scarred for life.

377
00:44:00,772 --> 00:44:02,797
It'll all be over by tomorrow.

378
00:44:04,075 --> 00:44:05,839
I'm not even scared anymore.

379
00:44:17,956 --> 00:44:22,189
I think I saw Boyd.
He's outside the window.

380
00:44:22,293 --> 00:44:25,058
He's probably just taking a walk.

381
00:44:25,897 --> 00:44:27,592
Might still be hiding the ribbons.

382
00:44:27,699 --> 00:44:29,827
Poor bitch boy.

383
00:44:29,934 --> 00:44:32,801
Oh, Boyd can't survive, like,
10 minutes out in the woods.

384
00:44:32,904 --> 00:44:36,363
You saw how scared
he was today.

385
00:44:36,474 --> 00:44:38,704
Maybe he's with a girl.

386
00:44:38,810 --> 00:44:41,108
What are the odds
they're together right now?

387
00:44:41,212 --> 00:44:43,510
[They chuckle]

388
00:44:54,058 --> 00:44:56,527
Hey, maybe Andy's
living out in the forest

389
00:44:56,628 --> 00:44:59,256
like that lumberjack
and his family.

390
00:45:00,765 --> 00:45:03,132
Is there really a lumberjack
that killed his wife and kids?

391
00:45:04,502 --> 00:45:05,970
What are you? Stupid?

392
00:45:06,070 --> 00:45:09,836
10 years ago, this place used to be
one of those juvie delinquent camps.

393
00:45:09,941 --> 00:45:11,932
The water supply got poisoned
by toxic waste.

394
00:45:12,043 --> 00:45:13,909
That's why no one
comes up here anymore.

395
00:45:14,012 --> 00:45:14,672
<i>ORGY-</i>

396
00:45:14,779 --> 00:45:19,273
So if Andy's not living out
in the forest, then where is he?

397
00:45:19,384 --> 00:45:21,614
Don't forget about Boyd.

398
00:45:21,719 --> 00:45:24,620
I mean, like it or not,
these pledges are under our watch.

399
00:45:24,722 --> 00:45:27,487
I mean, we can't just kill 'em.

400
00:45:27,592 --> 00:45:29,390
Can we?

401
00:45:43,708 --> 00:45:44,869
Let's split up.

402
00:45:44,976 --> 00:45:47,741
All right.
I'll go down here.

403
00:46:21,612 --> 00:46:24,479
Hey, Boyd!

404
00:46:24,582 --> 00:46:26,448
Andy!

405
00:46:28,653 --> 00:46:32,021
Do you guys have any idea
how dead you are?

406
00:46:50,575 --> 00:46:54,876
Shane? Pledges?

407
00:46:54,979 --> 00:46:56,538
You wanna play a game?

408
00:46:56,647 --> 00:46:59,116
You like hiding out
in the forest alone?

409
00:46:59,217 --> 00:47:02,118
It's the only place
you can hide from me.

410
00:47:19,637 --> 00:47:20,763
Scare you, pal?

411
00:47:22,273 --> 00:47:23,240
I found a weapon.

412
00:47:24,308 --> 00:47:26,436
Let's go find these clowns
before the pledges get up.

413
00:47:26,544 --> 00:47:27,170
Why?

414
00:47:28,012 --> 00:47:30,071
Look, Morris,
I know why you bought this place.

415
00:47:30,181 --> 00:47:31,376
Why'd you come back up here?

416
00:47:31,482 --> 00:47:32,950
-It would look suspicious --
-Morris!

417
00:47:34,819 --> 00:47:35,479
[Sighs]

418
00:47:35,586 --> 00:47:37,281
I want to make sure he's gone.

419
00:47:37,388 --> 00:47:40,255
I want to make sure no one else
finds him, except maybe me.

420
00:47:40,358 --> 00:47:42,349
You want to find his body,
don't you?

421
00:47:42,460 --> 00:47:45,054
So you and the rest of the alumni
don't have to worry about it anymore.

422
00:47:54,906 --> 00:47:56,931
[Sighs]

423
00:48:31,909 --> 00:48:34,173
Did Boyd come back?

424
00:48:40,818 --> 00:48:42,752
I want to know what happened
at your initiation.

425
00:48:42,854 --> 00:48:44,583
Just between you and me.

426
00:48:45,990 --> 00:48:49,153
I don't want to talk about it.
It was horrible.

427
00:48:50,361 --> 00:48:53,422
I'm talking about the pledge
that disappeared“ John Ralston.

428
00:48:53,531 --> 00:48:55,499
I told you. He vanished.

429
00:48:55,600 --> 00:48:56,897
Yeah, you told me.

430
00:48:57,001 --> 00:48:58,526
And that makes me
an accessory to you

431
00:48:58,636 --> 00:49:01,503
and the rest of the alumni
if you did something really sick.

432
00:49:04,475 --> 00:49:06,603
- We buried him, okay?
-You buried him?

433
00:49:06,711 --> 00:49:10,511
We buried him alive in a coffin.

434
00:49:10,615 --> 00:49:12,743
It was a shallow grave.

435
00:49:12,850 --> 00:49:15,842
He was the whipping boy.

436
00:49:15,953 --> 00:49:17,443
The leaders really
had it out for that kid.

437
00:49:17,555 --> 00:49:18,989
I was just a pledge.

438
00:49:19,790 --> 00:49:23,727
He was down there screaming
his head off for a couple of hours.

439
00:49:24,629 --> 00:49:26,791
When they finally
had me dig him up,

440
00:49:26,898 --> 00:49:29,833
the coffin was there, but...

441
00:49:29,934 --> 00:49:31,629
he was gone.

442
00:49:31,736 --> 00:49:33,761
Morris, you realize
if the cops found out --

443
00:49:33,871 --> 00:49:35,339
I know.

444
00:49:35,439 --> 00:49:37,032
We'd go to jail.

445
00:49:37,141 --> 00:49:40,406
They'd think we killed him
and buried him somewhere.

446
00:49:41,045 --> 00:49:45,482
I looked everywhere for that kid.
He was just gone.

447
00:49:48,185 --> 00:49:49,880
I don't know what happened.

448
00:49:49,987 --> 00:49:53,116
So we just went back to Whitman.

449
00:49:53,224 --> 00:49:55,989
Pretend like he was never here.

450
00:49:56,093 --> 00:49:58,585
His parents were dead.
No friends came calling.

451
00:49:58,696 --> 00:50:00,630
We just thought it'd blow over.

452
00:50:00,731 --> 00:50:04,167
But then the cops showed up
a week later.

453
00:50:04,268 --> 00:50:06,737
We just kept to the story.

454
00:50:09,407 --> 00:50:13,241
Where are Andy and Boyd?
Where are they, Morris?

455
00:50:13,344 --> 00:50:16,177
I don't know!

456
00:50:18,182 --> 00:50:19,650
I don't know.

457
00:50:23,521 --> 00:50:27,754
You knew where he was buried
and you did nothing to save him.

458
00:50:27,858 --> 00:50:29,383
I told you, he vanished.

459
00:50:29,493 --> 00:50:31,359
How many times
do I have to tell you that?

460
00:50:33,197 --> 00:50:34,392
I gotta take a leak.

461
00:50:34,498 --> 00:50:37,297
Well, hurry up.
We have to find these kids.

462
00:50:37,401 --> 00:50:40,029
If we go back without 'em,
there's hell to pay.

463
00:50:41,172 --> 00:50:42,765
Let's go.

[Heartbeats]

465
00:51:13,170 --> 00:51:15,036
Hey, did he plant the ribbons?

466
00:51:15,139 --> 00:51:16,698
If you can find the ribbons,
we can figure out where he --

467
00:51:16,807 --> 00:51:18,104
[Shane screams]

468
00:51:40,264 --> 00:51:40,924
[Morris screams]

469
00:51:41,032 --> 00:51:41,794
Guys?

[Garrett yawns]

471
00:52:17,334 --> 00:52:18,233
I'm thirsty.

472
00:52:18,335 --> 00:52:19,359
Too much porn, eh?

473
00:52:19,470 --> 00:52:21,302
[Laughs]

474
00:52:21,405 --> 00:52:23,772
They take our pride,
I take the beer.

475
00:52:23,874 --> 00:52:25,467
Is Boyd back yet?

476
00:52:25,576 --> 00:52:28,102
Yeah. I think he's just playin'
out in the woods.

477
00:52:28,212 --> 00:52:29,941
Morris and Shane'll find him.

478
00:52:30,047 --> 00:52:31,412
They're gone.

479
00:52:32,817 --> 00:52:36,344
I found this.
Here we go again?

480
00:52:38,422 --> 00:52:41,255
I woke up this morning
'cause I thought I heard screaming.

481
00:52:41,358 --> 00:52:42,985
Look, today is the big day.

482
00:52:43,094 --> 00:52:44,926
There'll be lots of screaming
before the day's over.

483
00:52:45,029 --> 00:52:46,588
You gotta be ready for anything.

484
00:52:46,697 --> 00:52:49,064
It's just initiation.
It's all a test.

485

00:53:42,419 --> 00:53:45,980
We've got a long day ahead.
Don't get up until they make us.

488
00:53:47,525 --> 00:53:49,118
Do you hear something?

489
00:53:51,929 --> 00:53:53,522
Man, there's a lot of weird sounds
out there.

490
00:53:53,631 --> 00:53:55,030
You gonna go check 'em all out?

491
00:53:55,132 --> 00:53:57,396
No.
It sounded like a scream.

492
00:53:57,501 --> 00:53:58,696
It's initiation, fool!

493
00:53:58,803 --> 00:54:01,602
Unless you see a guy out there with
a hockey mask, don't worry about it.

494
00:54:01,705 --> 00:54:03,366
They're just trying
to scare the hell out of us.

495
00:56:00,057 --> 00:56:01,218
[Door closes]

496
00:56:01,325 --> 00:56:02,451
Where's Boyd?

497
00:56:03,727 --> 00:56:06,287
It's hide-and-go-seek.

498
00:56:06,397 --> 00:56:08,126
Well, let's go find 'em.

499
00:56:08,232 --> 00:56:10,564
Hey, every minute
they're gone and we're alone

500
00:56:10,668 --> 00:56:12,295
is another minute we're not getting
our balls shaved

501
00:56:12,403 --> 00:56:14,201
or our manhood glued to a tree.

502
00:56:14,305 --> 00:56:16,740
I scouted these guys
before I joined the house.

503
00:56:16,840 --> 00:56:19,070
I know what happens
on final initiation day.

504
00:56:19,176 --> 00:56:22,202
We should get lost
and stay lost.

505
00:56:22,313 --> 00:56:24,042
They're watching us right now.

506
00:56:24,148 --> 00:56:25,115
You think so?

507
00:56:27,318 --> 00:56:29,753
It's all part of initiation.

508
00:56:29,853 --> 00:56:34,313
They're watchin' us,
waiting for us to go crazy.

509
00:56:34,425 --> 00:56:37,190
And then...
they're gonna pounce!

510
00:56:42,399 --> 00:56:44,800
You know, if they're playing
some kind of game,

511
00:56:44,902 --> 00:56:47,166
we're not gonna get home
unless we find these guys.

512
00:56:47,271 --> 00:56:49,569
And Boyd, Andy --

513
00:56:49,673 --> 00:56:51,004
What?

514
00:56:51,108 --> 00:56:52,598
Maybe they're in the attic.

515
00:56:56,981 --> 00:56:59,245
Probably laughing
their heads off up here.

516
00:57:08,492 --> 00:57:09,891
Is that real blood?

517
00:57:09,994 --> 00:57:11,462
Whose blood?

518
00:57:13,364 --> 00:57:15,162
Let's get outta here.
You tell the others.

519
00:57:18,302 --> 00:57:21,272
All right, let's do a check
on the rest of the cabin area,

520
00:57:21,372 --> 00:57:22,271
then do a check in the forest.

521
00:57:22,373 --> 00:57:23,033
All right.

522
00:57:23,140 --> 00:57:24,039
If they're not here,
we're gonna leave.

523
00:57:24,141 --> 00:57:25,131
Yeah, cool.

524
00:57:29,880 --> 00:57:33,874
[Heartbeats]

525
00:57:38,455 --> 00:57:39,445
Go with him.

526
00:57:39,556 --> 00:57:41,081
Garret and I will search
the camp area.

527
00:57:47,431 --> 00:57:48,728
What the hell?

528
00:57:49,733 --> 00:57:51,326

01:13:30,873 --> 01:13:33,535
I didn't know you had
your cell phone on you.

707
01:13:33,643 --> 01:13:34,838
I checked before we left.

708
01:13:37,180 --> 01:13:40,081
What's goin' on, Garrett?
We gotta get outta here.

709
01:13:40,183 --> 01:13:42,379
Three years ago
when I was still in high school,

710
01:13:42,485 --> 01:13:44,579
I had a brother at Whitman.

711
01:13:44,687 --> 01:13:48,248
He joined a fraternity
called Gamma Kappa.

712
01:13:48,358 --> 01:13:52,317
They took him here for initiation
and they buried him alive!

713
01:13:54,564 --> 01:13:56,931
His name was John.

714
01:13:58,468 --> 01:13:59,765
John Ralston.

715
01:14:00,470 --> 01:14:02,996
- John Ralston.
-Was he up here when he vanished?

716
01:14:03,106 --> 01:14:04,699
I looked everywhere for that kid.

717
01:14:04,807 --> 01:14:06,002
Where are you, John?

718
01:14:06,109 --> 01:14:08,407
You knew where he was buried
and you did nothing to save him.

719
01:14:08,511 --> 01:14:10,240
I know. We'd go to jail.

720
01:14:10,346 --> 01:14:11,609
I want to make sure he's gone.

721
01:14:11,714 --> 01:14:14,046
I want to make sure no one else
finds him, except maybe me.

722
01:14:14,150 --> 01:14:15,379
You want to find his body,
don't you?

723
01:14:15,485 --> 01:14:17,817
John Ralston was never here.

724
01:14:17,920 --> 01:14:21,049
And no one at Gamma Kappa
remembers him.

725
01:14:21,157 --> 01:14:24,855
- My real name is Garrett Ralston.
-Garrett --

726
01:14:24,961 --> 01:14:28,795
You think we could let them live?
Could we?

727
01:14:28,898 --> 01:14:32,459
Somebody had to put an end to this
barbaric tradition called initiation.

728
01:14:32,568 --> 01:14:35,367
In my brother's case,
it was murder.

729
01:14:36,572 --> 01:14:38,438
They tried to keep it a secret.

730
01:14:38,541 --> 01:14:41,169
And they said it was an accident.

731
01:14:41,277 --> 01:14:44,736
It was murder.

732
01:14:44,847 --> 01:14:45,973
Almost.

733
01:14:47,316 --> 01:14:50,377
<i>I was the only one
he told where he was.</i>

734
01:14:50,486 --> 01:14:54,081
<i>I came up here looking for him
when he didn't come back to school.</i>

735
01:14:54,190 --> 01:14:55,055
<i>We found him.</i>

736
01:14:59,095 --> 01:15:00,460
<i>He found us.</i>

737
01:15:04,734 --> 01:15:06,668
Who the heck is "we"?

738
01:15:06,769 --> 01:15:09,761
The family. Blood is blood.

739
01:15:09,872 --> 01:15:11,636
The cops are gonna be here soon.

740
01:15:11,741 --> 01:15:13,800
The cops aren't coming, Kevin.

741
01:15:13,910 --> 01:15:16,345
I'm the only one who can help you.

742
01:15:17,213 --> 01:15:18,305
What about Stacey?

743
01:15:18,414 --> 01:15:20,382
Stacey is my sister.

744
01:15:21,117 --> 01:15:23,211
No one knows you're here.

745
01:15:23,319 --> 01:15:25,014
No one knows I'm here.

746
01:15:25,988 --> 01:15:28,355
Because we're not even
supposed to be here,

747
01:15:28,458 --> 01:15:31,223
'cause initiation
is immoral and wrong.

748
01:15:32,095 --> 01:15:33,824
But I'm your best friend.

749
01:15:33,930 --> 01:15:36,262
Yeah.
You are my best friend.

750
01:15:36,365 --> 01:15:39,062
And I couldn't have made it
through college without you, pal.

751
01:15:39,168 --> 01:15:41,660
This is gonna be hard for me.

752
01:15:41,771 --> 01:15:43,569
Don't make me call
Brother Johnny.

753
01:15:47,844 --> 01:15:49,539
I found a laptop in Shane's room.

754
01:15:49,645 --> 01:15:52,671
I e-mailed the cops, our friends
at the dorms, my friends,

755
01:15:52,782 --> 01:15:53,874
the dean, everybody.

756
01:15:53,983 --> 01:15:55,451
You can't run, Kevin.

757
01:15:55,551 --> 01:15:57,178
You can't hide.

758
01:15:57,286 --> 01:16:00,221
I don't believe you
about that e-mail. I know you.

759
01:16:00,323 --> 01:16:02,348
Don't make me enjoy killing you.

760
01:16:02,458 --> 01:16:03,983
I don't want to enjoy this.

761
01:16:04,093 --> 01:16:06,152
I know this place better
than you do.

762
01:16:06,262 --> 01:16:08,356
I've been comin' up here
for three years.

763
01:16:08,464 --> 01:16:11,365
My brother knows this place
like the back of his hand.

764
01:16:11,467 --> 01:16:13,265
He was buried here, remember?

765
01:16:17,373 --> 01:16:19,102
I would never hurt your brother.

766
01:16:19,208 --> 01:16:21,472
You know I would never
participate in something like that.

767
01:16:21,577 --> 01:16:24,808
I know. You're a good person
with strong morals.

768
01:16:24,914 --> 01:16:28,817
Unfortunately, I knew you
wouldn't be part of my revenge --

769
01:16:28,918 --> 01:16:29,680
murder.

770
01:16:37,860 --> 01:16:40,329
Which is why you gotta go, pal.

771
01:16:40,429 --> 01:16:42,261
Can't leave any witnesses.

772
01:16:42,365 --> 01:16:43,389
Look, I told you I sent
that e-mail.

773
01:16:43,499 --> 01:16:45,092
You are not gonna
get away with this.

774
01:16:45,201 --> 01:16:49,035
I sent an e-mail, too,
and it got bounced.

775
01:16:49,138 --> 01:16:51,505
The forest, the trees?

776
01:16:51,607 --> 01:16:53,473
They block all the signals.

777
01:16:56,045 --> 01:16:57,206
I'm not stopping.

778
01:16:58,414 --> 01:16:59,472
I love you, but...

779
01:17:02,818 --> 01:17:04,582
blood is thicker than beer.

780

911 <i>OPERATOR:
911 emergency.</i>

784
01:18:15,391 --> 01:18:18,486
Hello? My name's Kevin.
I'm a student at Whitman College.

785
01:18:18,594 --> 01:18:21,928
Okay, I'm with the Gamma Kappa
house, and there's been murders.

786
01:18:22,031 --> 01:18:22,896
They're all dead.

787
01:18:22,999 --> 01:18:25,161
Okay, I need you guys
to send up the cops right now.

788
01:18:25,268 --> 01:18:27,896
<i>AH right, sir. Calm down.
Where are you?</i>

789
01:18:42,151 --> 01:18:43,516
Okay, they'll be here soon?

790
01:18:43,619 --> 01:18:44,848
<i>The police are on their way.</i>

791
01:18:44,954 --> 01:18:47,389
<i>Keep your phone on
because I put a trace on your line</i>

792
01:18:47,490 --> 01:18:49,857
<i>in case you were wrong
about your location.</i>

793
01:18:49,959 --> 01:18:51,654
<i>That way takes much longer.</i>

794
01:18:51,761 --> 01:18:54,696
<i>Can you just hide
until the police arrive?</i>

795
01:18:54,797 --> 01:18:56,663
Yeah, I can hide.

796
01:18:56,766 --> 01:18:58,734
I'll be in the attic, okay?

797
01:19:02,438 --> 01:19:05,703
[Heartbeats]

798
01:20:14,510 --> 01:20:16,740
[Whispers]
They'll be here soon.

799
01:20:16,846 --> 01:20:18,245
Come on. Get here.

800
01:21:22,178 --> 01:21:22,770
Look, John!

801
01:21:29,485 --> 01:21:30,680
Look, you killed them.

802
01:21:42,097 --> 01:21:43,565
You got your revenge...

803
01:21:43,666 --> 01:21:47,034
against the ones
who put you through initiation...

804
01:21:47,136 --> 01:21:48,297
who buried you alive.

805
01:21:54,109 --> 01:21:55,634
I'm glad you killed them.

806
01:22:01,217 --> 01:22:03,083
I'm just a pledge like you were.

807
01:22:03,786 --> 01:22:05,880
I'm innocent.

808
01:22:05,988 --> 01:22:09,652
John, you have to understand.

809
01:22:09,758 --> 01:22:11,749
Initiation's over.

810
01:22:20,669 --> 01:22:21,636
No!

811
01:22:22,204 --> 01:22:24,571
[Groans]

812
01:22:46,562 --> 01:22:48,553
That one was for me.

813
01:23:09,351 --> 01:23:10,910
Everyone's dead, aren't they?

814
01:23:16,492 --> 01:23:19,223
Are you the one
who called the police?

815
01:23:19,328 --> 01:23:23,765
It's okay. We're here.
It's over.

816
01:23:23,866 --> 01:23:26,460
Initiation's over.

817
01:23:26,569 --> 01:23:28,230
What happened here?

818
01:23:28,337 --> 01:23:29,827
They're all dead.

819
01:23:39,548 --> 01:23:40,106
[Groans]

820
01:23:41,083 --> 01:23:42,244
Who did this?

821
01:23:42,351 --> 01:23:44,217
He's in the attic.
I killed him.

822
01:23:45,454 --> 01:23:47,149
He used to be a pledge like me.

823
01:23:48,257 --> 01:23:50,487
We searched the cabin,
the whole area,

824
01:23:50,593 --> 01:23:52,994
and all we're finding
are your dead friends.

825
01:23:53,095 --> 01:23:54,824
There's no one else.

826
01:23:54,930 --> 01:23:56,625
In the attic. I killed him.

827
01:23:56,732 --> 01:23:58,063
We looked everywhere.

828
01:23:58,167 --> 01:24:00,693
There's nothing in the attic
but lots of blood.

829
01:24:00,803 --> 01:24:05,036
Kevin, is it possible that you
murdered your fraternity brothers?

830
01:24:05,140 --> 01:24:08,075
No! I'm not a murderer!

831
01:24:08,177 --> 01:24:10,669
Well, how else do you
explain all of this?

832
01:24:10,779 --> 01:24:14,215
Look, I killed him, okay?
He killed everyone except for me.

833
01:24:14,316 --> 01:24:15,283
Who, Kevin?

834
01:24:16,285 --> 01:24:17,616
Who?

835
01:24:17,720 --> 01:24:23,557
John Ralston, Gamma Kappa.
He's still out there.

836
01:24:26,662 --> 01:24:31,691
<i>John Ralston, Gamma Kappa.
He's still out there.</i>

837
01:24:33,836 --> 01:24:39,775
<i>John Ralston, Gamma Kappa.
He's still out there.</i>
