1
00:00:46,538 --> 00:00:51,579
<i>Before man, before moon, before history,</i>

2
00:00:52,562 --> 00:00:57,472
<i>In a world made of magic and mystery,</i>

3
00:00:58,252 --> 00:01:01,534
<i>Gods and Titans, lightning and bone,</i>

4
00:01:02,222 --> 00:01:05,357
<i>Fought to possess the Chronos stone.</i>

5
00:01:05,358 --> 00:01:11,000
<i>For he who held the stone held the world,</i>

6
00:01:11,431 --> 00:01:16,223
<i>And into darkest earth the Titans were hurled.</i>

7
00:01:17,078 --> 00:01:21,838
<i>And Zeus, the thunder in his throne,</i>

8
00:01:23,141 --> 00:01:28,869
<i>Zeus became the ruler of them all.</i>

9
00:01:34,624 --> 00:01:36,894
<i>Come with me,</i>

10
00:01:37,348 --> 00:01:40,728
<i>across the sea of time.</i>

11
00:01:41,867 --> 00:01:44,552
<i>Come with me,</i>

12
00:01:44,554 --> 00:01:47,862
<i>across the sea of time,</i>

13
00:01:49,517 --> 00:01:52,959
<i>Where creatures never seen before,</i>

14
00:01:53,210 --> 00:01:56,414
<i>The Gorgon and the Manticore,</i>

15
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,093
<i>The Centaur 'neath the silver tree,</i>

16
00:02:01,465 --> 00:02:04,687
<i>Across the sea of time.</i>

17
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:17,536
<i>Come with me, across the sea of time.</i>

18
00:02:17,857 --> 00:02:24,162
<i>Come with me, across the sea of time,</i>

19
00:02:25,656 --> 00:02:29,197
<i>Where man and god meet in the dawn,</i>

20
00:02:29,199 --> 00:02:32,768
<i>Where gods are kings and men are pawns,</i>

21
00:02:32,770 --> 00:02:36,940
<i>And no man born is truly free,</i>

22
00:02:36,942 --> 00:02:40,784
<i>Across the sea of time.</i>

23
00:02:43,333 --> 00:02:49,287
<i>Zeus descended from the sky,
The lightning by his side,</i>

24
00:02:50,402 --> 00:02:56,895
<i>Love like thunder in his heart,
To take a mortal bride.</i>

25
00:02:57,205 --> 00:03:04,230
<i>And from their union came a son,
Half human and half god,</i>

26
00:03:04,232 --> 00:03:09,381
<i>With twice the strength of mortal men,
To walk…</i>

27
00:03:09,893 --> 00:03:14,124
<i>…where heroes trod.</i>

28
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:29,380
<i>Come with me, across the sea of time,</i>

29
00:03:30,815 --> 00:03:34,395
<i>When men have fallen to their knees,</i>

30
00:03:34,395 --> 00:03:38,005
<i>And all the gods ignore their pleas,</i>

31
00:03:38,005 --> 00:03:42,153
<i>The name they call is Hercules,</i>

32
00:03:42,688 --> 00:03:46,684
<i>Across the sea of time,</i>

33
00:03:49,561 --> 00:03:53,813
<i>Across the sea of time,</i>

34
00:03:53,813 --> 00:04:00,548
<i>- Time.
- Hercules.
- Across the sea of time.</i>

35
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:07,654
<i>- Time.
- Hercules.
- Across the sea of time.</i>

36
00:04:07,654 --> 00:04:15,023
<i>- Time.
- Hercules.
- Across the sea of time.</i>

37
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:01,700
Hmm, must've been something he ate.

38
00:07:03,155 --> 00:07:08,820
- Thank you, Hercules!
- Hooray for Hercules!
- Ha-ha-ha!

39
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,539
Destroyed the monster!

40
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:14,488
Huh! Thank you. Wow, that was fantastic!

41
00:07:15,309 --> 00:07:16,752
Nice job with the monster.

42
00:07:17,362 --> 00:07:18,285
No sweat.

43
00:07:19,223 --> 00:07:20,576
Where were you, anyway?

44
00:07:20,961 --> 00:07:22,564
Hey, I got here as soon as I could.

45
00:07:22,564 --> 00:07:25,589
I would've jumped in, but, well, you
looked like you were doin' okay.

46
00:07:26,430 --> 00:07:27,365
Thanks, buddy.

47
00:07:27,587 --> 00:07:30,289
Hercules, Hercules! Do ya like fish?

48
00:07:31,491 --> 00:07:32,566
Well, sure I…

49
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:41,899
And there's plenty more where that came from.
Free fish any time you want.

50
00:07:42,123 --> 00:07:43,955
A lifetime supply.

51
00:07:44,562 --> 00:07:48,092
Thanks, but I think this is a lifetime supply.

52
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:54,874
Come back anytime, Hercules. You're the best.

53
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:59,520
"Oh, Hercules, you're the best! How can we ever
repay you?! What can we ever…"

54
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:00,237
Here…

55
00:08:00,692 --> 00:08:01,695
…have a fish.

56
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,601
More fools to rob!

57
00:08:33,026 --> 00:08:35,765
Monsters, highwaymen. What's next? Satyrs?

58
00:08:41,335 --> 00:08:42,247
Nice place, huh?

59
00:08:43,868 --> 00:08:44,803
Yo, baby!

60
00:08:46,781 --> 00:08:48,350
You talkin' to me?

61
00:08:52,407 --> 00:08:55,910
Why don't you and your little friend
give yourselves a thrill?

62
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:58,873
Thanks, don't mind if we do.

63
00:09:01,588 --> 00:09:02,572
Come on, Gabrielle.

64
00:09:03,144 --> 00:09:04,687
You guys asked for it.

65
00:09:05,658 --> 00:09:09,203
We've, uh, had our eyes on you for,
uh, quite some time.

66
00:09:10,466 --> 00:09:12,415
I've had my eyes on you, too.

67
00:09:15,387 --> 00:09:17,068
Ya have, huh?

68
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:23,018
Who wouldn't notice such handsome, distinguished
satyrs with such a large bag of gold?

69
00:09:28,179 --> 00:09:29,558
Knock it off, hair-ball!

70
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:35,216
This gold, it didn't, by any chance, come from…

71
00:09:35,216 --> 00:09:39,432
the purses of innocent travelers
on the road to Corinth, did it?

72
00:09:40,659 --> 00:09:42,020
What if it did?

73
00:09:42,398 --> 00:09:45,019
Hmm. Well, if it did, I'd just have to…

74
00:09:47,001 --> 00:09:48,344
…take it back.

75
00:09:48,621 --> 00:09:50,694
Hey, give me that. It's ours.

76
00:09:50,694 --> 00:09:52,210
Sorry, I don't think so.

77
00:09:54,347 --> 00:09:57,054
You can't just walk in here and take our gold.

78
00:09:59,276 --> 00:10:02,111
You're welcome to try and stop me, goat-breath.

79
00:10:30,671 --> 00:10:31,153
Bravo!

80
00:10:32,662 --> 00:10:33,554
Ares.

81
00:10:33,985 --> 00:10:36,749
Ah, Xena, I love watching you work.

82
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:43,544
Thanks, but the mighty God of War doesn't come
down from Mount Olympus to a dive like this just
to see the floor show.

83
00:10:45,268 --> 00:10:46,667
You know me too well.

84
00:10:46,667 --> 00:10:48,008
That's for sure.

85
00:10:48,326 --> 00:10:50,623
Actually, there is something you can do for me.

86
00:10:50,995 --> 00:10:52,964
And, as usual, my answer is "No".

87
00:10:53,884 --> 00:10:57,000
It concerns your… friend, Hercules.

88
00:10:57,001 --> 00:11:00,122
My "friend"? Don't you mean your brother?

89
00:11:00,124 --> 00:11:03,608
Half-brother. I just thought you should know…

90
00:11:04,204 --> 00:11:05,849
…he's in grave danger.

91
00:11:05,849 --> 00:11:07,253
He's on his way to Thebes.

92
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:08,993
Isn't that where his mother lives?

93
00:11:09,370 --> 00:11:10,270
Yes…

94
00:11:10,622 --> 00:11:15,638
…but he must never get there. He's walking right
into a trap. Only you can stop him.

95
00:11:24,553 --> 00:11:27,373
Why should you care what happens to Hercules?

96
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:31,268
You know what they say, blood is thicker than nectar.

97
00:11:31,857 --> 00:11:32,935
I don't believe you.

98
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:35,100
This is one of your tricks.

99
00:11:35,570 --> 00:11:38,760
Xena! Frankly, I'm offended.

100
00:11:39,849 --> 00:11:45,042
You gods sit up there on Mount Olympus and
think you can play with us mortals like we were
toys!

101
00:11:45,296 --> 00:11:46,712
Well, I'm no toy.

102
00:11:47,359 --> 00:11:48,348
Ya got that?

103
00:11:51,525 --> 00:11:53,212
It was… it was nice talkin' to you.

104
00:11:53,766 --> 00:11:54,498
We've gotta go.

105
00:11:56,537 --> 00:11:58,967
Don't you think that he might've been telling the
truth for a change?

106
00:12:02,141 --> 00:12:02,840
Sorry.

107
00:12:03,288 --> 00:12:07,926
Ares has tried everything to draw me back into
his world of destruction.

108
00:12:07,926 --> 00:12:09,505
He's threatened me,

109
00:12:10,601 --> 00:12:11,622
tempted me,

110
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:14,600
framed me for a crime I didn't commit.

111
00:12:15,190 --> 00:12:17,845
So, now he's trying the sincere approach.

112
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,275
If Ares doesn't want Hercules to 
go up to Thebes,

113
00:12:22,536 --> 00:12:25,252
then it's probably the best place 
for Hercules to be.

114
00:12:32,082 --> 00:12:33,003
This is hot work!

115
00:12:36,332 --> 00:12:39,592
What are you complaining about? I'm the horse.

116
00:12:40,343 --> 00:12:42,673
I'm so hungry, I could eat that rotten fish.

117
00:12:43,565 --> 00:12:46,781
Don't worry. When we're through, mother 
will fix us one of her special…

118
00:12:53,082 --> 00:12:54,577
What is it? What's wrong?

119
00:13:19,253 --> 00:13:20,212
Zeus!

120
00:13:27,721 --> 00:13:29,004
Mother! Look out!

121
00:13:33,668 --> 00:13:34,498
Mother!

122
00:14:02,663 --> 00:14:03,262
No!

123
00:14:27,094 --> 00:14:29,544
Mother!

124
00:14:34,890 --> 00:14:36,708
Hercules! Calm down!

125
00:14:37,001 --> 00:14:39,963
How can I calm down when Zeus has kidnapped
my mother?!

126
00:14:40,004 --> 00:14:43,242
Well are you, are you sure he kidnapped her?

127
00:14:43,252 --> 00:14:46,630
Are you crazy? You saw it!

128
00:14:46,630 --> 00:14:48,703
Yeah, but, well,…

129
00:14:48,703 --> 00:14:51,387
she didn't look like she was putting
up much of a fight.

130
00:14:53,248 --> 00:14:55,005
What do you mean by that?!

131
00:14:55,216 --> 00:14:56,630
Nothing! I…

132
00:14:56,630 --> 00:15:00,100
look, I know how you feel about Zeus,
but, I mean,

133
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:01,828
after all, he is your father.

134
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:03,859
Don't remind me!

135
00:15:08,581 --> 00:15:09,319
Sorry.

136
00:15:10,008 --> 00:15:11,084
Where are you going now?

137
00:15:11,843 --> 00:15:12,834
To bring her back.

138
00:15:13,404 --> 00:15:17,032
You…you mean you're…you're…you're going 
to…to Mount Olympus?

139
00:15:17,107 --> 00:15:19,704
That's right. And don't try to stop me.

140
00:15:20,339 --> 00:15:22,285
Are you kidding?! I'm comin' with ya!

141
00:15:25,047 --> 00:15:28,329
Wow, Mount Olympus, the home of the gods.

142
00:15:28,983 --> 00:15:30,612
How come you don't go there more often?

143
00:15:30,612 --> 00:15:33,653
I mean, I know you hate that side of 
your family, but,

144
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:36,558
after all, Mount Olympus,

145
00:15:36,558 --> 00:15:38,364
it's gotta be fabulous.

146
00:15:40,026 --> 00:15:40,761
Whoa! What the…

147
00:15:41,015 --> 00:15:42,206
Oh, boys!

148
00:15:44,114 --> 00:15:46,174
Geronimo-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o!

149
00:15:58,372 --> 00:16:00,480
Hey, bro. Iolaus.

150
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:01,880
Hello, Aphrodite.

151
00:16:02,210 --> 00:16:02,897
Wow!

152
00:16:04,064 --> 00:16:07,011
Did you see that three-sixty?
Not too shabby, huh?

153
00:16:09,180 --> 00:16:10,232
Yeah, it was great.

154
00:16:10,232 --> 00:16:13,932
Listen, I don't really have time
to stand around discussing shell technique?

155
00:16:17,893 --> 00:16:21,477
Uh, better close that thing, Iolaus. You're 
tongue's getting all dusty.

156
00:16:23,501 --> 00:16:25,472
Hey, Hercules, hang on.

157
00:16:27,003 --> 00:16:29,050
Look, I know you're bummed about your mom.

158
00:16:29,509 --> 00:16:31,949
What do you care? I mean, she's not your mother.

159
00:16:32,338 --> 00:16:38,068
Look, you may think you're mad about Zeus taking
Alcmene, but you've got nothing on Hera.

160
00:16:44,197 --> 00:16:47,574
How dare he bring that floozy up here?

161
00:16:47,574 --> 00:16:49,736
Who does
he think he is? That…

162
00:16:50,325 --> 00:16:51,489
that…

163
00:17:12,340 --> 00:17:14,019
All I asked you to do…

164
00:17:14,019 --> 00:17:17,581
…was stop Hercules from being there when I
went to get his mother.

165
00:17:18,502 --> 00:17:21,321
A rather simple request,
I would've thought.

166
00:17:21,766 --> 00:17:25,838
Yes, Father. See I asked this mortal 
to help me, but I

167
00:17:25,998 --> 00:17:27,711
You asked a mortal to help you?!

168
00:17:28,606 --> 00:17:29,569
Who, may I ask?

169
00:17:30,659 --> 00:17:31,596
Xena.

170
00:17:32,132 --> 00:17:36,334
Xena? You'll use any excuse to get close 
to her, won't you?

171
00:17:37,014 --> 00:17:42,545
Father, you of all gods, must understand that,
well, some mortal women can just…

172
00:17:42,545 --> 00:17:43,341
Enough!

173
00:17:45,882 --> 00:17:49,539
I doubt that there's anything you can tell
your father about mortal women.

174
00:17:50,180 --> 00:17:51,099
Leave us.

175
00:17:56,686 --> 00:18:00,877
It is well for a mother to know where the 
loyalties of her children lie.

176
00:18:05,734 --> 00:18:07,086
I guess he told you.

177
00:18:08,065 --> 00:18:09,183
Shut up, Artemis.

178
00:18:10,939 --> 00:18:12,436
What is it with you and that Xena?

179
00:18:12,936 --> 00:18:13,967
She brings you
nothing but trouble.

180
00:18:13,967 --> 00:18:16,486
One of these days, Xena will come through for
me.

181
00:18:16,486 --> 00:18:17,967
Just you wait and see.

182
00:18:18,744 --> 00:18:20,398
You should live so long!

183
00:18:20,398 --> 00:18:22,320
Get it? You're an immortal?

184
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:24,578
How could you do it?

185
00:18:25,970 --> 00:18:30,556
How could you bring a mortal
to this sacred place, especially that mortal?

186
00:18:30,556 --> 00:18:33,265
I don't see that this is any of your concern.

187
00:18:33,565 --> 00:18:34,993
Where is she?

188
00:18:35,087 --> 00:18:38,408
Where did you put her? In the
servants' quarters?

189
00:18:38,408 --> 00:18:41,617
Some plush chamber of her
very own?

190
00:18:42,786 --> 00:18:45,790
Or perhaps the trophy room?

191
00:18:46,083 --> 00:18:46,740
Enough!

192
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:49,133
Remember to whom you are speaking!

193
00:18:49,134 --> 00:18:51,371
I am Zeus, King of the Gods!

194
00:18:53,033 --> 00:18:54,703
King of the Gods!

195
00:18:56,599 --> 00:18:58,559
But for how long?

196
00:19:27,553 --> 00:19:29,273
Come on, Hercules you heard her!

197
00:19:29,543 --> 00:19:32,067
It's crazy to go
up there if Hera's on the warpath!

198
00:19:32,450 --> 00:19:34,154
You know how
much she hates you!

199
00:19:35,014 --> 00:19:36,709
Iolaus, it's very simple.

200
00:19:36,709 --> 00:19:39,126
My mother's there, and I
have to get her back.

201
00:19:39,717 --> 00:19:41,635
You don't have to come if
you don't want to.

202
00:19:45,009 --> 00:19:45,490
True.

203
00:19:46,356 --> 00:19:49,296
I could just, uh, hang out down
here with you,

204
00:19:49,296 --> 00:19:50,935
keep you from getting lonely.

205
00:19:52,376 --> 00:19:53,484
As if!

206
00:19:54,812 --> 00:19:57,341
Be good, Iolaus. Don't do anything I wouldn't do.

207
00:19:58,336 --> 00:20:00,274
Ah, that's no fun. She's your sister.

208
00:20:03,475 --> 00:20:08,118
So, Aphrodite, looks like it's just you and me.

209
00:20:11,452 --> 00:20:15,965
Ah, you mortals might have to put up with these
natural disasters, but I don't.

210
00:20:15,965 --> 00:20:16,929
Toodles!

211
00:21:07,453 --> 00:21:09,158
The Chronos stone.

212
00:21:30,888 --> 00:21:32,372
Hang on! I'll get you!

213
00:21:34,884 --> 00:21:36,675
Hercules! It's closing!

214
00:21:48,128 --> 00:21:49,688
Gabrielle! Look out!

215
00:21:53,272 --> 00:21:54,393
Thanks.

216
00:21:56,002 --> 00:21:57,481
Look at them.

217
00:21:59,070 --> 00:22:02,348
Nothin' like a natural disaster to
bring out the bad guys.

218
00:22:03,306 --> 00:22:04,162
Come on.

219
00:22:09,064 --> 00:22:11,877
I think that belongs to the nice lady.

220
00:22:31,453 --> 00:22:33,075
Back off, low… lives.

221
00:22:33,124 --> 00:22:33,888
Make us.

222
00:22:33,488 --> 00:22:35,532
If I must.

223
00:22:50,137 --> 00:22:51,697
Xena! Look out!

224
00:22:56,306 --> 00:22:57,951
Hang on, kid. I'll getcha.

225
00:23:06,090 --> 00:23:07,508
Gabrielle! Look out!

226
00:23:15,445 --> 00:23:16,344
Get outta my way!

227
00:23:21,579 --> 00:23:22,528
Take that!

228
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:56,305
Help!

229
00:24:15,051 --> 00:24:15,870
Gotcha!

230
00:24:23,990 --> 00:24:24,976
Good work, Iolaus.

231
00:24:53,939 --> 00:24:58,171
Let me pass in peace, little man.

232
00:24:58,999 --> 00:25:05,404
My quarrel is not with mortals,
but with the gods who imprisoned
me beneath the earth.

233
00:25:05,204 --> 00:25:08,185
If I let you pass,

234
00:25:08,185 --> 00:25:11,688
do you pledge to leave the mortal world alone, 
and take your fight to Mount Olympus?

235
00:25:28,632 --> 00:25:30,952
You have my word.

236
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:33,640
Go.

237
00:25:45,565 --> 00:25:46,861
Who's Mr. Big?

238
00:25:47,932 --> 00:25:49,612
His name is Porphyrion.

239
00:25:50,063 --> 00:25:51,110
He's a Titan.

240
00:25:51,904 --> 00:25:53,375
A Titan?!

241
00:27:22,619 --> 00:27:23,872
Hello.

242
00:27:41,591 --> 00:27:43,616
No more stealing…

243
00:27:43,616 --> 00:27:46,601
…or you'll wish he had squashed
you like a bug.

244
00:27:47,054 --> 00:27:48,934
Y…yes, ma'am.

245
00:27:50,078 --> 00:27:51,570
Xena, look!

246
00:28:05,150 --> 00:28:08,095
The ancient prophecy has come true at last.

247
00:28:08,095 --> 00:28:10,909
The Titans have escaped from
their prison in Tartarus.

248
00:28:10,909 --> 00:28:13,465
Do you, do you think they'll come here?

249
00:28:13,632 --> 00:28:16,137
Of course, they'll come here. They want revenge.

250
00:28:16,137 --> 00:28:19,477
But we will beat them, right?
I mean this prophecy,

251
00:28:19,477 --> 00:28:21,583
it does say we win in the end.

252
00:28:21,683 --> 00:28:24,047
The source of our power is the Chronos stone,

253
00:28:24,047 --> 00:28:26,018
which we won from them many years ago

254
00:28:26,865 --> 00:28:28,699
and with which we could easily defeat 
them again.

255
00:28:28,699 --> 00:28:32,148
But, as you can see, the Chronos stone is gone.

256
00:28:33,802 --> 00:28:35,901
That evens the odds considerably.

257
00:28:37,244 --> 00:28:38,887
Should be quite a battle.

258
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:42,108
A bit soon to celebrate, isn't it?

259
00:28:43,060 --> 00:28:45,304
Ya haven't even
met the Titans, yet.

260
00:28:45,677 --> 00:28:46,260
Hera!

261
00:28:48,755 --> 00:28:51,227
Where's the Chronos stone? What have
you done with it?

262
00:28:51,695 --> 00:28:52,908
Why suspect me?

263
00:28:53,608 --> 00:28:58,138
Perhaps your mortal took it. You
can't trust them, you know.

264
00:28:59,299 --> 00:29:05,539
What a predicament! The Titans are coming, 
and no Chronos stone to protect you.

265
00:29:07,674 --> 00:29:14,552
I have it! A champion of mortal blood
can defend you from the big, bad Titans.

266
00:29:14,552 --> 00:29:16,772
Doesn't the prophecy say that?

267
00:29:19,388 --> 00:29:25,099
You could ask your son, Hercules, to help you, 
if you hadn't just kidnapped his mother.

268
00:29:39,512 --> 00:29:40,833
Thank you, Hercules.

269
00:29:44,564 --> 00:29:47,014
There, everything seems to be under control, here.

270
00:29:47,014 --> 00:29:48,367
I'd better get going.

271
00:30:05,589 --> 00:30:06,706
Thanks, bro.

272
00:30:07,529 --> 00:30:09,447
I think you're losing your technique.

273
00:30:10,644 --> 00:30:16,321
Hercules, I know you're mad at Zeus and all, but
you gotta help us! The Titans are coming!

274
00:30:16,842 --> 00:30:18,773
I know. I met one of them.

275
00:30:18,773 --> 00:30:20,103
You let him go?!

276
00:30:20,732 --> 00:30:24,039
But you gotta stop 'em down here,
before they reach Mount Olympus!

277
00:30:24,039 --> 00:30:26,560
Come on, be
our champion, please?

278
00:30:28,528 --> 00:30:31,962
Sorry, if I fought the Titans here, 
innocent people might get hurt.

279
00:30:32,585 --> 00:30:35,424
Besides. I'm not sure I'm on your side.

280
00:30:36,493 --> 00:30:37,414
Great.

281
00:30:38,082 --> 00:30:39,329
Thanks for nothin'.

282
00:30:42,716 --> 00:30:43,847
So that's it?

283
00:30:43,847 --> 00:30:45,424
You're just gonna let the gods down?

284
00:30:46,349 --> 00:30:48,322
They'll find their champion.

285
00:30:50,042 --> 00:30:52,246
That's right. You're not the only hero on Earth.

286
00:30:57,462 --> 00:30:59,445
Is there nothing that Xena can't do?

287
00:31:00,028 --> 00:31:01,639
What're you doing here?

288
00:31:02,043 --> 00:31:04,700
I came to laugh at you. Don't you ever learn?

289
00:31:05,443 --> 00:31:07,275
Ya have to admit, she's perfect for the job.

290
00:31:07,565 --> 00:31:09,903
Yeah, but, she'll never do it.

291
00:31:09,904 --> 00:31:11,490
If I explain to her what's at stake…

292
00:31:11,490 --> 00:31:13,621
She'll think you're lying to her like you always do.

293
00:31:13,621 --> 00:31:16,060
She'll denounce the gods like she always does.

294
00:31:16,060 --> 00:31:19,869
She might even kick your butt while she's 
at it. Should be fun to watch.

295
00:31:22,314 --> 00:31:24,250
Yeah, you're right.

296
00:31:27,486 --> 00:31:30,585
Here, I'll show you how to deal with a mortal.

297
00:31:41,655 --> 00:31:42,581
How many more?

298
00:31:43,884 --> 00:31:45,013
Quite a few.

299
00:31:45,984 --> 00:31:48,563
Word of your healing has gotten around.

300
00:31:51,070 --> 00:31:51,934
Gabrielle?

301
00:31:52,355 --> 00:31:53,637
Are you all right?

302
00:31:55,743 --> 00:31:56,538
Of course,

303
00:32:04,692 --> 00:32:06,130
No-o-o-o-o-o-o!

304
00:32:17,949 --> 00:32:18,939
Gabrielle!

305
00:32:25,027 --> 00:32:25,525
Sorcery!

306
00:32:25,525 --> 00:32:26,396
Now, what?

307
00:32:27,778 --> 00:32:28,638
We wait.

308
00:32:46,612 --> 00:32:50,322
This is the hour of our rebirth!

309
00:32:53,434 --> 00:33:00,152
And we shall take
our vengeance on the gods of Olympus who
imprisoned us so long ago.

310
00:33:08,256 --> 00:33:12,491
We'll blow 'em away, won't we, Mnemosyne?

311
00:33:17,924 --> 00:33:22,213
We'll make them burn!

312
00:33:31,792 --> 00:33:33,241
Cool off, you two.

313
00:33:40,003 --> 00:33:45,714
I have waited too many years, in the
bowels of the Earth, to waste time now.

314
00:33:45,714 --> 00:33:47,564
What is our plan?

315
00:33:47,564 --> 00:33:54,162
Simple, we will attack Mount Olympus, regain
the sacred stone of our father, Chronos,

316
00:33:54,162 --> 00:33:56,139
and rule the universe!

317
00:34:06,198 --> 00:34:08,389
Is this the stone you seek?

318
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:19,565
Stand back.

319
00:34:22,669 --> 00:34:25,566
While I have the stone, you are in my power.

320
00:34:25,566 --> 00:34:28,839
Understand? You work for me.

321
00:34:32,663 --> 00:34:36,646
Don't fret. You
shall rule the universe,

322
00:34:36,646 --> 00:34:38,921
under my command.

323
00:34:43,932 --> 00:34:45,010
Gabrielle.

324
00:34:46,496 --> 00:34:47,552
I'm so sorry.

325
00:34:47,552 --> 00:34:49,368
This is the work of the gods.

326
00:34:49,868 --> 00:34:51,423
It's aimed at me, not you.

327
00:34:56,447 --> 00:34:58,530
If only I knew you could understand.

328
00:35:12,690 --> 00:35:15,174
I'll make thinks right, Gabrielle, I promise.

329
00:35:34,889 --> 00:35:36,122
Hey, calm down.

330
00:35:37,055 --> 00:35:39,019
You can do it, I know you can.

331
00:35:43,956 --> 00:35:45,510
Come on, Gabrielle, go for it.

332
00:35:53,258 --> 00:35:56,476
I'm starting to think this wasn't such a good
idea-a-a-a-a-a!

333
00:36:04,114 --> 00:36:05,977
Fly, Gabrielle, fly!

334
00:36:16,753 --> 00:36:18,236
Yes! Ya did it!

335
00:36:51,861 --> 00:36:54,803
Huh?! Aphrodite, why aren't you ready
for battle?

336
00:36:55,574 --> 00:36:59,350
I'm sending out a calming aura to neutralize the
bad Titan vibes.

337
00:36:59,350 --> 00:37:03,125
And if that doesn't work, I plan to
hide in my shell.

338
00:37:05,421 --> 00:37:06,874
Shh. What's that?

339
00:37:25,639 --> 00:37:31,086
Of all the tricks you've ever played on mortals this
was the lowest.

340
00:37:31,868 --> 00:37:34,494
It wasn't me. She did it.

341
00:37:35,482 --> 00:37:38,198
Just because I refuse to help in this plot against Hercules…

342
00:37:38,351 --> 00:37:39,833
This has nothing to do with Hercules.

343
00:37:43,752 --> 00:37:45,168
It's the Titans.

344
00:37:46,542 --> 00:37:51,211
If you help us defeat them, I'll turn
your friend back into a human.

345
00:38:01,371 --> 00:38:05,334
And next time, try asking first.

346
00:38:14,319 --> 00:38:15,369
Ya hanging in there?

347
00:38:15,369 --> 00:38:20,303
Yeah, but I can see why the gods aren't bothered
by pesky drop-in guests!

348
00:38:21,313 --> 00:38:23,942
Whoa! Not another Earthquake!

349
00:38:27,978 --> 00:38:29,223
It's the Titans.

350
00:40:18,630 --> 00:40:19,887
Gabrielle!

351
00:41:30,782 --> 00:41:31,866
Thanks.

352
00:41:36,004 --> 00:41:37,464
You're not really welcome.

353
00:41:52,459 --> 00:41:54,896
This is gonna be harder than I thought.

354
00:42:11,716 --> 00:42:14,564
Oh, baby, that's what I like.

355
00:42:35,423 --> 00:42:38,366
Hercules. It's about time.

356
00:42:44,305 --> 00:42:45,865
Looks like the party started without me.

357
00:42:54,396 --> 00:42:56,216
Unfortunately, I can't stay.

358
00:43:01,695 --> 00:43:02,754
But… but…

359
00:43:04,729 --> 00:43:05,687
Aphrodite!

360
00:43:12,919 --> 00:43:17,595
I'm going to crush your skull like an egg.

361
00:43:18,283 --> 00:43:19,855
Sorry, no time.

362
00:44:37,170 --> 00:44:39,362
I never thought I'd see you help
me out of a tangle.

363
00:44:39,422 --> 00:44:41,340
Looks like you're havin' a bad hair day.

364
00:44:47,353 --> 00:44:48,292
Mother!

365
00:45:26,573 --> 00:45:28,429
I have no fight with you.

366
00:45:29,043 --> 00:45:31,100
You let me go in peace.

367
00:45:31,642 --> 00:45:33,412
I return the favour.

368
00:45:44,851 --> 00:45:45,774
Hercules!

369
00:45:46,474 --> 00:45:49,069
Iolaus, I have to get my mother to safety.

370
00:45:50,782 --> 00:45:52,760
Go ahead! I'm gonna stay and fight!

371
00:45:53,991 --> 00:45:55,545
Not me. I'm outta here.

372
00:46:06,985 --> 00:46:07,981
No! Let me go!

373
00:46:37,250 --> 00:46:38,829
Come back, you cowards!

374
00:46:38,990 --> 00:46:43,201
Run, my family, like the frightened 
little animals you are.

375
00:46:44,636 --> 00:46:49,196
Yes, like frightened little animals.

376
00:46:58,513 --> 00:47:02,967
You have chosen the wrong side on which to
fight today.

377
00:47:02,967 --> 00:47:05,678
It ain't over 'til it's over, big boy.

378
00:47:23,750 --> 00:47:27,226
You mean to tell me, you didn't even lift a finger
to help?

379
00:47:28,009 --> 00:47:32,579
I…I…look… I…I climbed Mount Olympus.
I…I rescued you from Zeus.

380
00:47:32,579 --> 00:47:33,679
What do you want from me?

381
00:47:33,792 --> 00:47:36,281
Did you ever think to ask if I wanted to be rescued?

382
00:47:42,521 --> 00:47:45,002
Open up! It's me, Zeus!

383
00:47:47,663 --> 00:47:49,686
Where… where are you?

384
00:47:49,874 --> 00:47:51,145
Down here!

385
00:47:52,195 --> 00:47:54,911
Zeus, what happened to you?

386
00:47:56,034 --> 00:47:57,051
Hera.

387
00:48:05,232 --> 00:48:06,320
Hey, lady!

388
00:48:07,468 --> 00:48:08,212
Lemme in!

389
00:48:10,361 --> 00:48:11,203
Ares?

390
00:48:13,110 --> 00:48:17,574
Just watchit. Don't make me ma-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-d.

391
00:48:22,035 --> 00:48:23,867
Uh, I think I'm allergic to rabbit fur.

392
00:48:23,928 --> 00:48:25,838
Mo-o-o-o-o-ove!

393
00:48:29,860 --> 00:48:32,508
Uh, this is so gross.

394
00:48:32,508 --> 00:48:36,837
I don't even eat red meat
and now I am red meat.

395
00:48:40,591 --> 00:48:43,638
What are you laughing at?!
This is all your fault!

396
00:48:44,914 --> 00:48:47,242
Yeah, why didn't you pitch in up there?

397
00:48:47,831 --> 00:48:51,406
Now the Titans rule the universe. Who knows
what misery they'll cause.

398
00:48:53,602 --> 00:48:56,874
They couldn't do much worse than you have, now,
could they?

399
00:49:09,363 --> 00:49:11,286
Is this really how people live down here?

400
00:49:12,161 --> 00:49:14,097
Uh, pathetic.

401
00:49:16,250 --> 00:49:17,580
Mother, would you wait?!

402
00:49:24,894 --> 00:49:26,882
Oh, Iolaus! I knew you'd make it!

403
00:49:29,449 --> 00:49:30,444
Yeah, huh.

404
00:49:30,750 --> 00:49:31,195
What?

405
00:49:32,273 --> 00:49:34,812
What? I couldn't stay. I had to get my mom.

406
00:49:34,812 --> 00:49:36,599
I…Xena, I…

407
00:49:36,599 --> 00:49:37,768
Forget it!

408
00:49:39,816 --> 00:49:41,698
Oh, and say hello to Gabrielle.

409
00:49:43,122 --> 00:49:43,952
Gabrielle?

410
00:49:44,831 --> 00:49:46,774
Oh, maybe you didn't recognize her…

411
00:49:47,892 --> 00:49:49,348
…thanks to your family.

412
00:50:02,260 --> 00:50:04,931
Hey meet the former gods of Olympus.

413
00:50:06,546 --> 00:50:08,911
Which one of you animals is Artemis?

414
00:50:15,843 --> 00:50:16,852
Uh, that would be me.

415
00:50:40,557 --> 00:50:44,990
Why, Mother? Why would you go with Zeus, after
the way he's treated us all these years?

416
00:50:44,990 --> 00:50:49,910
I mean,
he's never been there for us, not once. I mean,
what could he possibly have to offer you?

417
00:50:53,104 --> 00:50:53,634
Life.

418
00:50:54,326 --> 00:50:54,673
What?

419
00:50:54,673 --> 00:50:56,572
I know. I know, I should've told you.

420
00:50:57,200 --> 00:50:59,317
I've been ill for
quite some time.

421
00:51:00,564 --> 00:51:03,713
I didn't realize how ill until a
recent visit to the Oracle.

422
00:51:04,846 --> 00:51:06,121
I didn't know what to do.

423
00:51:06,123 --> 00:51:07,687
Then, one day, Zeus appeared.

424
00:51:10,661 --> 00:51:11,041
He knew.

425
00:51:12,452 --> 00:51:15,845
And he made me an offer which would
make up for all his years of neglect.

426
00:51:16,634 --> 00:51:20,809
He would take me to Mount Olympus, where I
would become an immortal.

427
00:51:21,961 --> 00:51:24,112
It was the hardest
decision I ever had to make.

428
00:51:26,469 --> 00:51:29,990
To lose my life, or
risk losing you from my life.

429
00:51:31,404 --> 00:51:32,850
Why didn't you tell me?

430
00:51:34,670 --> 00:51:36,361
I knew you'd try to stop me.

431
00:51:36,725 --> 00:51:38,456
You've always hated
your father so.

432
00:51:44,726 --> 00:51:45,856
As long as you're happy.

433
00:51:55,221 --> 00:51:55,921
What?

434
00:51:56,398 --> 00:51:58,543
What do you mean, you can't change her back?

435
00:51:59,335 --> 00:52:01,937
If I could change her, do you think I'd stay
a bunny rabbit?

436
00:52:04,515 --> 00:52:08,776
Not that I don't, uh, sympathize, believe me, but,
hey, these things happen

437
00:52:10,009 --> 00:52:11,788
Ooh, what do birds your
size eat, anyway?

438
00:52:15,001 --> 00:52:16,029
Oh, I was afraid of that.

439
00:52:20,125 --> 00:52:21,258
It's the Chronos stone.

440
00:52:22,038 --> 00:52:27,349
As long as the Titans
control Mount Olympus, they have the stone, and
we have no powers.

441
00:52:28,308 --> 00:52:31,016
Yeah, we're stuck down here…

442
00:52:31,016 --> 00:52:34,934
…while Hera lives it up on Mount
Olympus with the Titans.

443
00:52:53,425 --> 00:52:55,300
<i>We're the Titans,</i>

444
00:52:55,400 --> 00:52:57,025
<i>we're the best.</i>

445
00:52:58,280 --> 00:53:01,287
<i>We're bigger and we're smarter than the rest.</i>

446
00:53:02,618 --> 00:53:05,804
<i>And after all the years we were repressed,</i>

447
00:53:06,684 --> 00:53:10,356
<i>We're the Titans, we're the best.</i>

448
00:53:11,407 --> 00:53:15,817
<i>We romped on them, we stomped on them,
We blew them to their knees.</i>

449
00:53:16,520 --> 00:53:18,457
Can we boast?

450
00:53:20,335 --> 00:53:22,721
<i>We drowned them and we pounded them,</i>

451
00:53:22,724 --> 00:53:24,474
<i>And squashed them all like fleas.</i>

452
00:53:25,496 --> 00:53:26,982
Now they're toast.

453
00:53:28,926 --> 00:53:32,235
<i>We're the Titans, we are strong.</i>

454
00:53:33,289 --> 00:53:36,748
<i>We knew that we could beat them all along.</i>

455
00:53:38,022 --> 00:53:41,823
<i>They thought that they could win,
but they were wrong, wrong, wrong.</i>

456
00:53:41,823 --> 00:53:45,614
<i>We're the Titans, we are strong.</i>

457
00:53:53,571 --> 00:53:55,146
<i>Oh, yeah.</i>

458
00:54:04,119 --> 00:54:07,651
<i>We're the Titans, we're the worst.</i>

459
00:54:08,896 --> 00:54:11,983
<i>We're meaner and we're so much more perversed.</i>

460
00:54:13,579 --> 00:54:16,524
<i>Zeus had all the luck, but now is cursed,</i>

461
00:54:17,154 --> 00:54:20,934
<i>'Cause we're the Titans, we're the worst</i>

462
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:27,723
<i>We trounced them and we bounced them,
And we pushed them off the edge into the void.</i>

463
00:54:28,328 --> 00:54:30,006
What's a void?

464
00:54:30,681 --> 00:54:33,883
And once the Chronos stone is truly mine…

465
00:54:33,883 --> 00:54:34,499
It's mine.

466
00:54:34,645 --> 00:54:36,166
<i>The world will be destroyed.</i>

467
00:54:36,166 --> 00:54:38,568
I'm getting annoyed.

468
00:54:39,440 --> 00:54:42,907
<i>We're the Titans, we rule the day.</i>

469
00:54:43,490 --> 00:54:47,212
<i>We'll make the gods and little humans pay.</i>

470
00:54:48,464 --> 00:54:51,811
<i>We'll bury them beneath our feet of clay.</i>

471
00:54:52,769 --> 00:54:56,305
<i>We're the Titans, we're okay.</i>

472
00:55:21,676 --> 00:55:23,275
Quiet!

473
00:55:26,301 --> 00:55:28,726
I can't even hear myself gloat.

474
00:55:29,742 --> 00:55:32,923
Just look at
this place! It's a disaster!

475
00:55:36,433 --> 00:55:40,541
I had forgotten just how
stupid you Titans were.

476
00:55:40,541 --> 00:55:42,680
You belong down in Tartarus!

477
00:55:47,353 --> 00:55:48,045
Sorry.

478
00:55:54,383 --> 00:55:58,570
To think I have an eternity of this to look forward to.

479
00:56:04,349 --> 00:56:07,634
Is that old hag going to boss us around forever?

480
00:56:07,634 --> 00:56:13,871
No, not forever. In fact, not much longer.

481
00:56:21,913 --> 00:56:23,341
Gabrielle,…

482
00:56:23,826 --> 00:56:26,237
…this is terrible. I don't know what to do.

483
00:56:27,280 --> 00:56:28,544
I don't know what to do.

484
00:56:29,379 --> 00:56:31,851
This is a fine mess we're in.

485
00:56:34,011 --> 00:56:35,552
I don't know what to do.

486
00:56:36,052 --> 00:56:41,811
<i>I went and let the bad guys win.
Look what they did to you.</i>

487
00:56:43,872 --> 00:56:46,561
<i>I thought I was a warrior.</i>

488
00:56:47,357 --> 00:56:55,638
Still, I failed somehow.
So tell me, what do I do now?

489
00:57:00,430 --> 00:57:06,513
<i>I thought if I did my best,
I'd never make mistakes.</i>

490
00:57:07,289 --> 00:57:10,265
<i>I'd always win the battle,</i>

491
00:57:11,556 --> 00:57:14,249
<i>no matter what it takes.</i>

492
00:57:15,202 --> 00:57:21,206
<i>I'd keep my friends from danger.
That's my sacred vow.</i>

493
00:57:21,206 --> 00:57:26,692
<i>So tell me, what do I do now?</i>

494
00:57:29,318 --> 00:57:35,182
<i>Hear me, silver sister moon, shinin' in the blue,</i>

495
00:57:36,389 --> 00:57:42,383
<i>Had I wings to fly away, I would fly to you.</i>

496
00:57:46,304 --> 00:57:49,090
<i>But that's not what warriors do.</i>

497
00:57:56,306 --> 00:57:59,475
<i>Maybe there's more to bein' human,</i>

498
00:58:00,681 --> 00:58:02,823
<i>than actin' brave and strong.</i>

499
00:58:03,345 --> 00:58:06,186
<i>Maybe it's list'ning' to your heart,</i>

500
00:58:07,302 --> 00:58:09,963
<i>and knowin' when you're wrong.</i>

501
00:58:10,828 --> 00:58:17,223
<i>It's keepin' the faith and trustin'
you'll come through, somehow.</i>

502
00:58:17,486 --> 00:58:22,467
<i>And maybe, that's what I'll do now.</i>

503
00:58:24,603 --> 00:58:28,822
<i>I believe we'll come through, me and you.</i>

504
00:58:30,375 --> 00:58:36,021
<i>That's what we'll do… now.</i>

505
00:58:41,522 --> 00:58:42,712
Oh, hi.

506
00:58:42,727 --> 00:58:44,861
So, you're, talking to me, now?

507
00:58:46,310 --> 00:58:51,346
I had no right to blame you for what's happened
to Gabrielle. If I hadn't been so…

508
00:58:54,101 --> 00:58:56,782
We've both made some mistakes, lately.

509
00:58:58,262 --> 00:58:59,447
The
question is,…

510
00:59:00,628 --> 00:59:02,307
what're we gonna do about it, now?

511
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:09,689
This is all Hercules' fault.

512
00:59:09,722 --> 00:59:14,568
My Dear, you know as well as I, that Hera would
never have revived the Titans if you hadn't brought
me to Mount Olympus.

513
00:59:16,418 --> 00:59:17,600
Well, uh…

514
00:59:17,418 --> 00:59:19,867
And if we had been frank with our son,

515
00:59:19,900 --> 00:59:22,842
he might
have been there at your side when you needed him.

516
00:59:22,982 --> 00:59:26,936
She's right, you know? He's always been there
for me, before.

517
00:59:26,936 --> 00:59:28,397
Yeah, for me, too.

518
00:59:28,877 --> 00:59:31,925
So, in other words, I'm to blame.

519
00:59:31,925 --> 00:59:33,487
No, not really,

520
00:59:33,487 --> 00:59:35,226
but it was good of you to say it.

521
00:59:37,191 --> 00:59:39,175
Hey, why is everyone looking so gloomy?

522
00:59:39,725 --> 00:59:41,686
You think
we're gonna take this lying down?

523
00:59:42,664 --> 00:59:45,656
I would, if I could figure out how to get back up.

524
00:59:46,376 --> 00:59:47,970
Xena and I were talking.

525
00:59:47,970 --> 00:59:50,973
The thought of my mother
spending the rest of her life,

526
00:59:50,973 --> 00:59:55,220
surrounded by a
bunch of whining farm animals who think they
should be ruling the universe…

527
00:59:56,405 --> 00:59:58,727
And Gabrielle staying the way she is.

528
00:59:59,463 --> 01:00:02,865
These aren't situations we're prepared just 
to sit back and accept.

529
01:00:04,011 --> 01:00:05,948
So, we've decided…

530
01:00:06,776 --> 01:00:08,866
…to attack Mount Olympus.

531
01:00:10,400 --> 01:00:13,659
Why not? The Titans took it from you. We'll just
go up there and take it back from them.

532
01:00:13,759 --> 01:00:15,256
You've forgotten one thing.

533
01:00:15,256 --> 01:00:19,585
The Chronos stone. As long as Hera and the 
Titans control it, we have no powers.

534
01:00:20,168 --> 01:00:25,115
Well, I don't mean to be insulting, but, 
you didn't do so hot when you had powers, did you?

535
01:00:27,300 --> 01:00:34,159
Son, I mean it. If you go back to Mount Olympus,
there's a good chance you won't come down alive.

536
01:00:35,218 --> 01:00:38,495
It's a chance I'm willing to take…father.

537
01:00:57,956 --> 01:00:59,837
Disgusting!

538
01:01:00,242 --> 01:01:03,427
And you want to rule over all creation? Hah.

539
01:01:11,821 --> 01:01:13,042
Well,

540
01:01:13,042 --> 01:01:20,047
coming back to play, are we? Let's make
things a bit more interesting this time…

541
01:01:20,047 --> 01:01:22,975
and teach
these buffoons a lesson.

542
01:01:46,132 --> 01:01:49,429
Hey! I feel pain!

543
01:01:49,700 --> 01:01:55,502
I tingle! Strange! Hold it! Stop it!

544
01:02:16,968 --> 01:02:17,948
No!

545
01:02:47,245 --> 01:02:52,289
Now, Hercules and his little friends won't stand
a chance.

546
01:02:55,012 --> 01:02:59,441
Give me… the stone!

547
01:03:05,289 --> 01:03:10,282
Get away, you lummox!
Go defend your new empire!

548
01:03:58,420 --> 01:04:01,377
We have the power, now!

549
01:04:04,590 --> 01:04:07,211
What are you doing?!
What are you doing?!

550
01:05:00,558 --> 01:05:04,249
Is it just me, or have these guys gotten even uglier?

551
01:05:14,182 --> 01:05:16,929
Well, one thing's for sure, they
haven't gotten any nicer.

552
01:06:10,324 --> 01:06:12,748
You know? This could go on forever.

553
01:06:26,552 --> 01:06:28,489
Got any bright ideas?

554
01:06:34,852 --> 01:06:39,135
Now that you mention it, I do have a thought.
Keep them busy!

555
01:07:10,245 --> 01:07:11,781
Throw them over the side!

556
01:08:32,574 --> 01:08:37,083
It's no good. He draws his power from the earth,
and every time he goes down, he gets stronger.

557
01:08:37,083 --> 01:08:39,035
Yeah. What can we do?

558
01:08:43,870 --> 01:08:46,172
I've got an idea. Come on.

559
01:08:53,430 --> 01:08:57,508
You should've quit when you were ahead, little man.

560
01:09:04,806 --> 01:09:05,805
Grab him!

561
01:09:19,537 --> 01:09:22,851
I… never… quit!

562
01:09:26,634 --> 01:09:28,239
Now! Drop him!

563
01:10:21,669 --> 01:10:23,180
Hercules!

564
01:10:32,309 --> 01:10:35,364
Climb, Gabrielle, climb! Back to Olympus! Hurry!

565
01:11:18,095 --> 01:11:20,631
Hey, nice job with that monster.

566
01:11:21,901 --> 01:11:23,763
You didn't do so badly yourself.

567
01:11:47,745 --> 01:11:50,021
Gabrielle, can you ever forgive me?

568
01:11:52,354 --> 01:11:55,825
There's nothin' to forgive. I knew you'd come
through for me.

569
01:11:56,671 --> 01:11:58,268
I sort of enjoyed the flying part.

570
01:12:02,138 --> 01:12:04,989
It was fun while it lasted.

571
01:12:13,805 --> 01:12:15,632
He's…he's here.

572
01:12:25,137 --> 01:12:27,525
I will miss you every day.

573
01:12:30,674 --> 01:12:31,828
Just remember,…

574
01:12:32,578 --> 01:12:34,043
…I'll be watching over you.

575
01:12:55,009 --> 01:12:55,833
Son,…

576
01:12:57,872 --> 01:12:59,621
…you know you're always welcome at
my, uh…

577
01:12:59,621 --> 01:13:00,816
Yeah, I know.

578
01:13:24,037 --> 01:13:25,795
She'll be okay.

579
01:13:27,057 --> 01:13:28,448
He does care for her.

580
01:13:33,948 --> 01:13:35,648
So, where are you headed?

581
01:13:36,448 --> 01:13:39,436
Corinth. I still have a bag of gold to return.

582
01:13:41,341 --> 01:13:43,526
Maybe, we could walk along with you for a while.

583
01:13:44,608 --> 01:13:45,486
Sure.

584
01:13:45,486 --> 01:13:46,783
That'd be great.

585
01:13:49,906 --> 01:13:52,989
And along the way, you can teach me that great
kick you did up there against Porphyrion.

586
01:13:52,989 --> 01:13:55,761
Sure, if you'll teach me how to flip a Titan.

587
01:13:55,761 --> 01:13:58,796
I would love to, but it's a family secret.

588
01:14:02,007 --> 01:14:05,892
