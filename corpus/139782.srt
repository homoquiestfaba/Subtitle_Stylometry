1
00:01:01,694 --> 00:01:05,755
I won't... I won't forget
your kindness.

2
00:01:10,937 --> 00:01:13,838
I lived there once.

3
00:01:13,873 --> 00:01:15,966
A long time ago.

4
00:01:28,755 --> 00:01:30,746
Go.

5
00:04:31,004 --> 00:04:34,235
<i>Police radio:

6
00:04:37,343 --> 00:04:39,334
<i>Call again.</i>

7
00:05:13,546 --> 00:05:15,537
Donuts, Michael?
You kill me.

8
00:05:15,581 --> 00:05:18,015
Mmm.
So I am a walking cliché.

9
00:05:19,752 --> 00:05:21,743
Is that what I think it is?

10
00:05:21,788 --> 00:05:23,779
Maple-glazed buttermilk.

11
00:05:27,293 --> 00:05:29,386
You'll enjoy the regular glazed.

12
00:05:29,429 --> 00:05:31,226
Oh, God!

13
00:05:31,264 --> 00:05:33,994
Um, actually I'd enjoy it better
if you eased off the gas.

14
00:05:34,033 --> 00:05:37,560
- What's the rush?
- They found number three.

15
00:05:37,603 --> 00:05:39,594
How do you know
it's the same perp?

16
00:05:39,639 --> 00:05:41,630
Sure looks like his signature.

17
00:05:41,674 --> 00:05:43,665
Did he cut out a liver?

18
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:46,543
- Or a kidney?
- This time it was the heart.

19
00:05:49,215 --> 00:05:51,809
<i>Oh God!</i>

20
00:06:39,098 --> 00:06:41,089
Hello?

21
00:06:44,871 --> 00:06:47,066
Is anybody there?

22
00:07:12,298 --> 00:07:14,095
Who the heck are you?

23
00:07:14,133 --> 00:07:17,466
I'm here for Ben.

24
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:19,801
Ben's dead.

25
00:07:22,642 --> 00:07:24,633
A mugging.

26
00:07:24,677 --> 00:07:26,668
<i>He got shot.</i>

27
00:07:30,216 --> 00:07:32,207
Anyway...

28
00:07:32,251 --> 00:07:34,242
you missed him
by a week.

29
00:07:38,357 --> 00:07:40,348
<i>In the old days...</i>

30
00:07:40,393 --> 00:07:43,385
a face like yours was worth gold
in the freak shows.

31
00:07:45,531 --> 00:07:47,522
You must be Deucalion.

32
00:07:47,567 --> 00:07:49,558
I've had many names.

33
00:07:49,602 --> 00:07:51,593
That's what Ben called you.

34
00:07:51,637 --> 00:07:54,162
Said you were one
of his top draws.

35
00:07:54,207 --> 00:07:56,198
They called me

36
00:07:56,242 --> 00:07:58,233
"The Monster. "

37
00:08:09,689 --> 00:08:11,680
O'Conner:
Oh, great!

38
00:08:11,724 --> 00:08:14,192
<i>Dispatcher:
Unit 16 responding code 3.</i>

39
00:08:14,227 --> 00:08:18,391
<i>- Oh, jeez.
- Unit 4 responding code 3.</i>

40
00:08:23,202 --> 00:08:25,193
Detective Harker.

41
00:08:25,238 --> 00:08:27,866
Frye.
You're up early.

42
00:08:27,907 --> 00:08:29,898
Well...

43
00:08:29,942 --> 00:08:31,876
we were in the area.
We got the call.

44
00:08:31,911 --> 00:08:33,401
No, this is our case.

45
00:08:33,446 --> 00:08:36,108
Last week's liver man
is this week's thief of hearts.

46
00:08:36,148 --> 00:08:37,911
There's no connection, Sloane.

47
00:08:37,950 --> 00:08:40,544
There will be.
Did you ID the victim yet?

48
00:08:42,488 --> 00:08:45,389
Yeah.
Robert Vincent Allwyne.

49
00:08:45,424 --> 00:08:47,415
Library's night security man.

50
00:08:52,231 --> 00:08:53,892
Excuse me.

51
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:57,730
<i>Dispatcher:
Unit 52 code 12...</i>

52
00:09:28,668 --> 00:09:31,569
Carson.

53
00:09:31,604 --> 00:09:34,630
They're saying the killer
had some skill.

54
00:09:34,674 --> 00:09:38,166
He, uh...
cracked the breast plate,

55
00:09:38,210 --> 00:09:40,201
extracting the uh...
heart with precision.

56
00:09:40,246 --> 00:09:42,874
Then he travels
with tools, right?

57
00:09:42,915 --> 00:09:44,906
Should be his Indian name.

58
00:09:44,951 --> 00:09:47,317
I don't want to give Harker and Frye
any more ammo,

59
00:09:47,353 --> 00:09:50,845
but uh,
Carson, the body is behind you.

60
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:54,583
Did you see the books?

61
00:09:54,627 --> 00:09:57,391
Yeah,
it must have been a hell of a struggle.

62
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:59,421
No signs of a struggle.

63
00:09:59,465 --> 00:10:01,262
Yeah? Tell that to the dude
without a heart.

64
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:04,235
The guard's gun
is still holstered.

65
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:07,137
And some of these books
are stacked pretty neatly.

66
00:10:07,173 --> 00:10:09,164
<i>Check this out.</i>

67
00:10:09,208 --> 00:10:11,472
<i>The book was opened on this page
when the killing occurred.</i>

68
00:10:12,778 --> 00:10:15,269
So what,
the killer kicked back,

69
00:10:15,314 --> 00:10:17,339
read a chapter or two
after he diced the guy out?

70
00:10:17,383 --> 00:10:19,374
What is that, anyway?

71
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,145
"Auburn Psychology,"
a self-help book?

72
00:10:23,189 --> 00:10:25,657
<i>Harker:
You found something?</i>

73
00:10:26,859 --> 00:10:30,226
Just enough
to make me sure I'm right.

74
00:10:30,262 --> 00:10:32,253
What might that be?

75
00:10:32,298 --> 00:10:35,699
Read it in our report, or are you still
"hooked on phonics?"

76
00:10:35,735 --> 00:10:37,293
Sloane:
Oh-oh!

77
00:10:39,405 --> 00:10:41,703
Who found the body?

78
00:10:41,741 --> 00:10:43,732
Librarian.
Nancy Whistler.

79
00:10:43,776 --> 00:10:45,767
She's um...

80
00:10:45,811 --> 00:10:48,473
she's in the can.

81
00:10:48,514 --> 00:10:50,505
Apparently she won't come out.

82
00:10:53,853 --> 00:10:55,946
I'm Detective O'Conner.
Detective Sloane.

83
00:10:58,257 --> 00:11:00,248
Are you all right?

84
00:11:00,292 --> 00:11:04,319
Every time I think
I just can't puke again, I do.

85
00:11:04,363 --> 00:11:06,354
Sloane:
I love this job.

86
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:08,731
You were the first
to enter the library this morning?

87
00:11:08,768 --> 00:11:10,759
<i>You're sure the place
was locked up?</i>

88
00:11:10,803 --> 00:11:13,897
I'm sure.
God, he was such a toad.

89
00:11:13,939 --> 00:11:15,930
But he didn't deserve that.

90
00:11:15,975 --> 00:11:18,739
<i>Bobby Allwyne, the guard.</i>

91
00:11:18,778 --> 00:11:22,179
He was a creep.

92
00:11:22,214 --> 00:11:26,082
But why would someone
take his heart?

93
00:11:26,118 --> 00:11:28,712
I don't know.
Souvenir.

94
00:11:28,754 --> 00:11:31,245
Sexual gratification,
dinner.

95
00:11:31,290 --> 00:11:33,281
Oh-hh.

96
00:11:35,361 --> 00:11:37,352
Nice!

97
00:11:37,396 --> 00:11:40,058
<i>What?</i>

98
00:11:43,436 --> 00:11:45,461
<i>Sloane:
Bobby Allwyne.</i>

99
00:11:45,504 --> 00:11:47,495
Room 301.

100
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:49,531
Did you call the super?
Get the keys?

101
00:11:49,575 --> 00:11:52,408
I got my lock pick.

102
00:11:52,445 --> 00:11:55,380
Okay.
And how about a warrant?

103
00:11:55,414 --> 00:11:58,679
You can't violate the rights
of a dead guy.

104
00:11:58,718 --> 00:12:00,709
Yeah, I guess that's true.

105
00:12:23,008 --> 00:12:25,272
<i>O'Conner:
Lacks a feminine touch.</i>

106
00:12:25,311 --> 00:12:27,302
Sloane:
Shabby Goth.

107
00:12:48,634 --> 00:12:50,625
I'm fine.

108
00:12:50,669 --> 00:12:52,660
Yeah?

109
00:12:52,705 --> 00:12:54,696
I'm okay.

110
00:13:03,649 --> 00:13:06,277
<i>It looks like the victim's crazier
than the killer.</i>

111
00:13:23,803 --> 00:13:25,794
Uh, Carson.

112
00:13:25,838 --> 00:13:28,671
<i>You're gonna want
to take a little look at this.</i>

113
00:14:23,128 --> 00:14:27,087
Ben told me
one day you'd come.

114
00:14:27,132 --> 00:14:29,123
Here.

115
00:14:29,168 --> 00:14:31,159
He wanted you
to have this.

116
00:14:46,719 --> 00:14:48,710
Helios.

117
00:15:01,033 --> 00:15:03,126
<i>Woman:
Do you know who he is,</i>

118
00:15:03,168 --> 00:15:05,762
this man Helios?

119
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:31,112
Do you know what I am?

120
00:16:31,156 --> 00:16:33,556
I know what Ben
thought you were.

121
00:16:33,592 --> 00:16:36,618
And do you know
why I've come?

122
00:16:38,864 --> 00:16:40,957
To kill that man?

123
00:16:56,915 --> 00:16:59,247
There are fingerprints
in some of these glasses.

124
00:17:02,788 --> 00:17:04,779
Too much greenery.
Emphasize the blooms.

125
00:17:04,823 --> 00:17:08,088
I didn't arrange the lilies, sir.

126
00:17:08,127 --> 00:17:10,118
<i>Mrs. Helios preferred
to do it herself.</i>

127
00:17:10,162 --> 00:17:12,153
You do them.

128
00:17:12,197 --> 00:17:14,529
But don't say anything to my wife.
She'll learn.

129
00:17:26,378 --> 00:17:28,369
You can't improve
on perfection.

130
00:17:31,617 --> 00:17:33,608
That's sweet.

131
00:17:33,652 --> 00:17:35,643
I like looking nice for you.

132
00:17:39,391 --> 00:17:41,382
Then wash most of that off.

133
00:17:44,763 --> 00:17:46,958
Let your natural beauty
shine through.

134
00:17:46,999 --> 00:17:49,593
The guests won't look ridiculous.
Neither should you.

135
00:17:51,537 --> 00:17:53,528
Diamonds would be
a better choice.

136
00:17:56,308 --> 00:17:59,300
Your standards are...

137
00:17:59,344 --> 00:18:01,335
so high.

138
00:18:04,683 --> 00:18:06,674
That's why I made you...

139
00:18:09,621 --> 00:18:11,612
my wife.

140
00:18:20,032 --> 00:18:21,522
<i>Harker:
Yo, O'Conner?</i>

141
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:29,931
I feel for you, O'Conner.

142
00:18:29,975 --> 00:18:31,966
I do.

143
00:18:32,010 --> 00:18:34,001
I'm your best friend.

144
00:18:35,247 --> 00:18:38,239
I think it's karma that brought us
together, don't you, Harker?

145
00:18:38,283 --> 00:18:40,274
<i>Are you gonna make a report?</i>

146
00:18:40,319 --> 00:18:42,310
Wouldn't be doing my homework
if I didn't.

147
00:18:43,889 --> 00:18:45,880
Too bad Allwyne

148
00:18:45,924 --> 00:18:49,485
wasn't one of The Surgeon's victims,
though.

149
00:18:49,528 --> 00:18:52,292
Really, based on what?

150
00:18:52,331 --> 00:18:54,322
Well,

151
00:18:54,366 --> 00:18:57,961
the other two were abducted
from their homes, bound and gagged.

152
00:18:58,003 --> 00:19:00,995
Allwyne was just laying there
like he wanted to be butchered.

153
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:03,030
Assisted suicide.

154
00:19:06,178 --> 00:19:08,169
With a little twist.

155
00:19:08,213 --> 00:19:10,204
I bet any day now,

156
00:19:10,249 --> 00:19:13,650
we're gonna find some nutty Goth
with a bloody scalpel in his hand

157
00:19:13,685 --> 00:19:15,312
and a heart in his back pocket.

158
00:19:15,354 --> 00:19:19,017
No, I was a Goth in high school
and I take offense to that comment.

159
00:19:22,761 --> 00:19:26,094
I'm just trying to be helpful.

160
00:19:26,131 --> 00:19:29,294
The guy was suicidal.

161
00:19:29,334 --> 00:19:31,325
This is not your case!

162
00:19:33,539 --> 00:19:35,530
Come on!

163
00:19:35,574 --> 00:19:38,270
Razor blades and black rooms.

164
00:19:38,310 --> 00:19:42,974
- The guy had a death wish.
- You searched Allwyne's apartment?

165
00:19:43,015 --> 00:19:45,006
Don't piggyback my case!

166
00:19:45,050 --> 00:19:47,041
I'm just trying to cover your ass!

167
00:19:50,422 --> 00:19:52,049
You mean my nice ass?

168
00:20:06,438 --> 00:20:09,407
Biotechnology is a tool,
nothing more.

169
00:20:09,441 --> 00:20:12,342
One man's tool
is another man's weapon.

170
00:20:12,377 --> 00:20:14,174
<i>Precisely.</i>

171
00:20:14,213 --> 00:20:16,204
A gun can save a life
or take one.

172
00:20:16,248 --> 00:20:17,772
Depends on the man
who uses it.

173
00:20:17,816 --> 00:20:20,478
And then the argument becomes,
which man gets the power?

174
00:20:20,519 --> 00:20:22,510
The ability to manipulate
our genome.

175
00:20:22,554 --> 00:20:24,818
That power should be in the hands

176
00:20:24,856 --> 00:20:27,120
of those with vision.

177
00:20:27,159 --> 00:20:29,150
A vision for the future.

178
00:20:29,194 --> 00:20:32,357
<i>And that's exactly
what disturbs me, Doctor.</i>

179
00:20:38,437 --> 00:20:39,927
The flowers are perfect.

180
00:20:39,972 --> 00:20:41,963
Sorry, Victor.

181
00:20:42,007 --> 00:20:44,999
- We'll discuss it later. Not now!
- Let me just...

182
00:20:50,482 --> 00:20:52,416
<i>Guest:
So, father...</i>

183
00:20:52,451 --> 00:20:55,579
what do you make
of all this...

184
00:20:55,621 --> 00:20:57,612
stem cell research,
this cloning?

185
00:20:59,524 --> 00:21:03,483
I've been fortunate to be a guest
at this table for quite a while...

186
00:21:03,528 --> 00:21:05,519
<i>and I've learned over the years</i>

187
00:21:05,564 --> 00:21:07,293
<i>that nobody really
wants to have dinner</i>

188
00:21:07,332 --> 00:21:09,493
with a disagreeable old priest.

189
00:21:10,669 --> 00:21:14,469
Therefore,
I agree with Dr. Helios.

190
00:21:14,506 --> 00:21:16,599
Whatever he says.

191
00:21:17,609 --> 00:21:20,635
Well,
I stand corrected.

192
00:21:20,679 --> 00:21:22,909
<i>Cheers!</i>

193
00:21:33,358 --> 00:21:35,349
Woman:
Damn thing!

194
00:21:35,394 --> 00:21:37,885
<i>Deucalion:
You should get cable.</i>

195
00:21:37,929 --> 00:21:40,898
<i>Anchorwoman:
The mutilated body of a 35 year-old man</i>

196
00:21:40,932 --> 00:21:43,457
<i>was discovered this morning
at the central library.</i>

197
00:21:43,502 --> 00:21:46,437
<i>Police are investigating whether this
may be the third victim</i>

198
00:21:46,471 --> 00:21:49,133
<i>of a serial killer known as
"The Surgeon. "</i>

199
00:21:49,174 --> 00:21:52,109
<i>Two other recent murders
have been attributed to this killer.</i>

200
00:21:52,144 --> 00:21:55,079
<i>His signature is the removal
of body parts and internal organs</i>

201
00:21:55,113 --> 00:21:57,308
<i>with surgical precision, apparently.</i>

202
00:21:57,349 --> 00:22:00,113
<i>Last night's slaying is similar
to other Surgeon murders,</i>

203
00:22:00,152 --> 00:22:02,985
<i>though police are only providing
sketchy details.</i>

204
00:22:25,577 --> 00:22:28,978
I'm sorry, Victor.

205
00:22:31,183 --> 00:22:32,912
It's not your fault.

206
00:22:47,566 --> 00:22:50,399
I don't excite you.

207
00:22:50,435 --> 00:22:52,426
Usually, yes.

208
00:22:54,206 --> 00:22:56,197
Tonight, no.

209
00:23:00,512 --> 00:23:03,811
<i>I'm going to go
to the hospital.</i>

210
00:23:03,849 --> 00:23:06,477
I am in a creative mood.

211
00:23:10,055 --> 00:23:13,115
Victor.

212
00:23:13,158 --> 00:23:15,149
I want to please you.

213
00:23:19,664 --> 00:23:23,532
More than anything.

214
00:23:23,568 --> 00:23:26,901
But sometimes I just don't know
what you want.

215
00:23:34,479 --> 00:23:36,470
Perfection.

216
00:23:49,961 --> 00:23:51,952
The M.E. Should be about done.

217
00:23:51,997 --> 00:23:54,522
I want to hit the morgue tonight.

218
00:23:54,566 --> 00:23:57,399
Right.

219
00:23:57,436 --> 00:24:00,428
Hey, look.
Why don't we blow off the morgue?

220
00:24:00,472 --> 00:24:03,635
<i>Look, between the department
and your brother,</i>

221
00:24:03,675 --> 00:24:06,303
you don't sleep.

222
00:24:06,344 --> 00:24:08,676
So which isn't important,
my job or my brother?

223
00:24:08,713 --> 00:24:12,274
I just... I just think you should
take a break once in a while.

224
00:24:12,317 --> 00:24:14,945
The Surgeon is not taking
a break.

225
00:24:16,021 --> 00:24:18,819
Even psychotic killers
take the occasional nap.

226
00:24:18,857 --> 00:24:21,291
<i>You know, go see a movie.</i>

227
00:24:23,895 --> 00:24:26,022
Sloane.

228
00:24:26,064 --> 00:24:28,032
<i>Oh, really?</i>

229
00:24:28,066 --> 00:24:30,057
We'll be right there.

230
00:24:32,170 --> 00:24:34,161
The M.E. Is done
with Allwyne's body.

231
00:24:34,206 --> 00:24:38,370
He says he found something.
He says we have to see it to believe it.

232
00:24:40,312 --> 00:24:42,303
Wait, my drink!

233
00:25:40,238 --> 00:25:41,728
Yes.

234
00:25:43,542 --> 00:25:46,272
Something's happening to me.

235
00:25:48,046 --> 00:25:49,741
Who is this?

236
00:25:51,950 --> 00:25:53,884
I want an explanation.

237
00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:56,615
Are you one of mine?

238
00:25:56,655 --> 00:25:59,886
<i>Yes.
Please help me, I'm very scared.</i>

239
00:25:59,925 --> 00:26:03,759
I've begun to change.

240
00:26:03,795 --> 00:26:05,786
What do you mean, change?

241
00:26:05,830 --> 00:26:09,425
Something inside.
I can feel it, there's something there.

242
00:26:09,467 --> 00:26:11,458
Come to me.

243
00:26:11,503 --> 00:26:13,494
I'll give you

244
00:26:13,538 --> 00:26:16,132
whatever guidance you need.

245
00:26:19,144 --> 00:26:22,170
I've killed three men.

246
00:26:22,213 --> 00:26:24,204
The third was one of yours.

247
00:26:26,551 --> 00:26:28,542
<i>You watch the news?</i>

248
00:26:40,966 --> 00:26:43,628
<i>Gentlemen,
I need your assistance.</i>

249
00:26:50,342 --> 00:26:52,333
O'Conner: So Jack,
what do you have for us?

250
00:26:52,377 --> 00:26:54,368
First I found a cavity.

251
00:26:54,412 --> 00:26:56,403
Something had been removed.

252
00:26:56,448 --> 00:26:58,439
I was thinking a cyst
or a tumor.

253
00:26:58,483 --> 00:27:00,474
Then I find its own ascending aorta,

254
00:27:00,518 --> 00:27:03,180
vena cava, epicardium.

255
00:27:03,221 --> 00:27:05,212
Apparently in working order.

256
00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:10,821
Jack, we've seen the body.
We know the heart was removed.

257
00:27:11,997 --> 00:27:13,988
Hearts.

258
00:27:14,032 --> 00:27:16,023
Hearts?

259
00:27:16,067 --> 00:27:18,058
As in plural?

260
00:27:19,738 --> 00:27:22,764
So Bobby Allwyne had some kind
of birth defect?

261
00:27:22,807 --> 00:27:24,798
Not a defect.

262
00:27:24,843 --> 00:27:26,834
This is different.

263
00:27:26,878 --> 00:27:30,279
If anything, it gave him
increased circulation.

264
00:27:30,315 --> 00:27:32,510
A resistance to thrombosis or angina.

265
00:27:32,550 --> 00:27:35,041
There is more.
I borrowed a densitometer from County

266
00:27:35,086 --> 00:27:37,077
and ran a bone mineral content.

267
00:27:37,122 --> 00:27:39,989
He's got a calcium index
10 times higher than normal.

268
00:27:40,025 --> 00:27:42,186
Meaning?

269
00:27:42,227 --> 00:27:44,218
<i>His bones are like concrete.</i>

270
00:27:44,262 --> 00:27:47,163
He also has 30 percent more lymph nodes
than your average male,

271
00:27:47,198 --> 00:27:49,189
an abnormally large spleen,

272
00:27:49,234 --> 00:27:51,225
four extra molars,

273
00:27:51,269 --> 00:27:53,260
a third frontal sinus,

274
00:27:53,304 --> 00:27:56,899
and two organs...
I don't even know what they are.

275
00:27:56,941 --> 00:28:00,138
Okay, Jacky.
I want you to do me a favor, pal.

276
00:28:00,178 --> 00:28:02,169
Touch your nose
with your forefingers.

277
00:28:02,213 --> 00:28:04,340
I haven't been drinking.

278
00:28:04,382 --> 00:28:06,509
<i>Let me get this straight, Jack.
Bobby Allwyne...</i>

279
00:28:06,551 --> 00:28:08,542
wasn't a freak of nature,

280
00:28:08,586 --> 00:28:10,577
he was better than nature?

281
00:28:12,190 --> 00:28:14,181
These anomalies are advances.

282
00:28:16,895 --> 00:28:18,886
Advantages.

283
00:28:18,930 --> 00:28:21,023
Evolution.

284
00:28:21,066 --> 00:28:22,931
<i>I should have a report for you
by tomorrow noon.</i>

285
00:28:22,967 --> 00:28:24,958
I just wanted
to give you some idea

286
00:28:25,003 --> 00:28:27,198
of what
you stumbled onto.

287
00:28:28,373 --> 00:28:30,364
Yeah, okay.

288
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:37,571
Um...

289
00:28:44,856 --> 00:28:46,847
What the hell
have we stumbled onto?

290
00:28:46,891 --> 00:28:49,382
There's some connection here,
Michael.

291
00:28:52,163 --> 00:28:55,462
Bobby Allwyne's psychology,
his body, the killer.

292
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:58,196
Okay, so what are you saying?

293
00:28:58,236 --> 00:28:59,726
That the Surgeon somehow knew

294
00:28:59,771 --> 00:29:01,932
that Allwyne was some kind
of Ripley's freak?

295
00:29:01,973 --> 00:29:04,669
Just because it sounds crazy
doesn't mean it's not true.

296
00:29:04,709 --> 00:29:06,700
Okay, um...

297
00:29:08,246 --> 00:29:10,942
This is fun and stuff but,
now can we call it a night?

298
00:29:10,982 --> 00:29:13,974
Yeah. Let me stop by
and see Anthony first.

299
00:29:24,295 --> 00:29:26,286
Smells good.

300
00:29:26,331 --> 00:29:28,128
- He ate his dinner.
- Oh, good.

301
00:29:28,166 --> 00:29:31,226
<i>- But I made carrots and peas.
- Aahh!</i>

302
00:29:31,269 --> 00:29:34,432
Never green and orange together,
Vicky.

303
00:29:34,472 --> 00:29:37,339
<i>He has so many rules,
how can I remember them all?</i>

304
00:29:38,343 --> 00:29:40,334
Yeah.

305
00:29:44,916 --> 00:29:46,907
That's fit for King Arthur

306
00:29:46,951 --> 00:29:49,215
and all the Knights of the Round Table,
Anthony.

307
00:29:49,254 --> 00:29:51,245
Good work.

308
00:29:53,491 --> 00:29:55,482
Still hungry, Anthony?

309
00:29:55,527 --> 00:29:57,518
Want me to make you a sandwich?

310
00:30:07,839 --> 00:30:09,830
You okay?

311
00:30:20,285 --> 00:30:22,150
Are you afraid of something?

312
00:30:24,155 --> 00:30:26,623
<i>I wish you could tell me
what it is.</i>

313
00:30:33,164 --> 00:30:35,155
Why don't you just ask her?

314
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:36,861
Huh?

315
00:30:36,901 --> 00:30:39,699
Carson,
for a drink or dinner.

316
00:30:42,006 --> 00:30:43,997
I don't know
what you're talking about.

317
00:30:48,046 --> 00:30:50,037
The thing is...

318
00:30:50,081 --> 00:30:53,778
I'd probably miss kicking ass
and busting hunts together.

319
00:30:53,818 --> 00:30:56,013
Maybe that's just the way
you two relate the best.

320
00:30:56,054 --> 00:30:58,045
There's a depressing thought.

321
00:31:01,159 --> 00:31:03,992
<i>- We're going to be late.
- I figured as much.</i>

322
00:31:04,028 --> 00:31:06,326
Let me guess. We're going
back to Allwyne's apartment?

323
00:31:06,364 --> 00:31:08,764
Let's just say I want to spend
some quality time there.

324
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:11,360
Get in touch
with your inner psychic?

325
00:31:11,402 --> 00:31:13,097
<i>Yeah, something like that.</i>

326
00:31:13,137 --> 00:31:15,503
I'll drop you off?
Good night, Vicky.

327
00:31:17,542 --> 00:31:20,568
Ahem!
Can I get a to-go cup?

328
00:31:20,612 --> 00:31:22,910
Give me that.

329
00:31:22,947 --> 00:31:24,847
Shoo!

330
00:31:30,955 --> 00:31:33,287
Hey, you know,
I think the nanny's kind of into me.

331
00:31:33,324 --> 00:31:35,315
Oh, really?
Why?

332
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:37,351
You can just tell
she digs cops.

333
00:31:52,844 --> 00:31:54,835
<i>Helios:
How do you sleep?</i>

334
00:31:54,879 --> 00:31:57,541
<i>Do you dream?</i>

335
00:31:57,582 --> 00:31:59,948
Not often.

336
00:31:59,984 --> 00:32:02,817
Sometimes I have a nightmare.

337
00:32:02,854 --> 00:32:05,721
Pity.

338
00:32:05,757 --> 00:32:08,590
Perhaps that can be rectified
in the future.

339
00:32:13,464 --> 00:32:15,455
Patrick,

340
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:18,833
one of my people is having
a serious crisis of the mind.

341
00:32:21,506 --> 00:32:24,600
I don't know who he is.

342
00:32:24,642 --> 00:32:29,477
<i>- He's afraid to come to me.
- Perhaps not afraid.</i>

343
00:32:29,514 --> 00:32:31,505
Maybe he's ashamed.

344
00:32:31,549 --> 00:32:34,541
Ashamed that he's failed you.

345
00:32:41,659 --> 00:32:45,026
Search the city.

346
00:32:45,063 --> 00:32:47,054
Spread the word
among my people.

347
00:32:47,098 --> 00:32:51,364
Maybe they've seen
one of their kind behaving oddly.

348
00:32:51,402 --> 00:32:53,393
<i>If he runs, kill him.</i>

349
00:32:56,074 --> 00:32:59,635
Do you know...

350
00:32:59,677 --> 00:33:01,668
how he can be killed?

351
00:33:03,681 --> 00:33:05,672
I prefer to have him alive,

352
00:33:05,717 --> 00:33:07,708
but at least I need his body...

353
00:33:07,752 --> 00:33:09,743
to study.

354
00:33:11,889 --> 00:33:13,880
Bring him to me
at the hands of mercy.

355
00:33:23,234 --> 00:33:25,794
God bless you, Patrick.

356
00:33:27,805 --> 00:33:29,796
That was a joke.

357
00:34:01,973 --> 00:34:03,964
Hello?

358
00:35:38,202 --> 00:35:40,636
Go on,
move into the light.

359
00:35:45,176 --> 00:35:47,167
You're Detective O'Conner?

360
00:35:47,211 --> 00:35:49,236
How did you get in here?

361
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:51,612
I go where I want.

362
00:35:51,649 --> 00:35:55,642
In 200 years
I've learned a lot about locks.

363
00:35:55,686 --> 00:35:59,952
The man who lived here
was in despair.

364
00:35:59,991 --> 00:36:01,982
I recognize this man.

365
00:36:02,994 --> 00:36:05,053
So you're telling me
you knew Bobby Allwyne?

366
00:36:05,096 --> 00:36:08,259
He's like me,
not made of God.

367
00:36:08,299 --> 00:36:10,824
Yeah, right.

368
00:36:10,868 --> 00:36:13,598
He wanted to kill himself,
but couldn't take his own life.

369
00:36:13,638 --> 00:36:16,573
We're not designed to.

370
00:36:16,607 --> 00:36:19,371
Are you telling me
you helped him?

371
00:36:19,410 --> 00:36:21,401
I can help you.

372
00:36:21,445 --> 00:36:24,710
I'd recognize his killer
as plain as day.

373
00:36:24,749 --> 00:36:26,512
Spread your arms.
On your knees.

374
00:36:26,551 --> 00:36:29,850
I bow to no one.

375
00:36:29,887 --> 00:36:31,548
I wasn't asking!

376
00:36:31,589 --> 00:36:35,081
Will you shoot me in the heart?

377
00:36:35,126 --> 00:36:37,185
You'll need two bullets.

378
00:36:52,410 --> 00:36:54,401
What are you doing?

379
00:36:54,445 --> 00:36:56,436
Showing you the truth.

380
00:36:57,882 --> 00:36:59,873
Your real enemy is not the killer,

381
00:36:59,917 --> 00:37:01,908
it's his maker.

382
00:37:01,953 --> 00:37:04,581
And mine too.

383
00:37:04,622 --> 00:37:07,523
I was created
with bodies salvaged

384
00:37:07,558 --> 00:37:10,925
from a prison graveyard.
One heart from a thief.

385
00:37:10,962 --> 00:37:12,953
One from a crazed killer.

386
00:37:12,997 --> 00:37:14,624
Hands from a strangler.

387
00:37:14,665 --> 00:37:17,725
<i>Eyes from an axe murderer.</i>

388
00:37:17,768 --> 00:37:20,760
My life force
from a thunder storm.

389
00:38:14,792 --> 00:38:16,817
This is your home, not your office.
That matters, right?

390
00:38:16,861 --> 00:38:18,852
Carson, it's 3:00 A.M.

391
00:38:18,896 --> 00:38:20,955
- This is my home.
- I need someone to talk to.

392
00:38:20,998 --> 00:38:22,989
Unofficially, off-duty.

393
00:38:23,034 --> 00:38:25,525
I'm your friend first, you know that.
What happened?

394
00:38:28,239 --> 00:38:30,230
Have you ever seen a ghost?

395
00:38:35,913 --> 00:38:38,905
You thought he might be a suspect
in the Allwyne case?

396
00:38:38,949 --> 00:38:40,439
Yes.

397
00:38:40,484 --> 00:38:44,011
What changed your mind?

398
00:38:45,790 --> 00:38:49,248
Just a feeling, really.

399
00:38:49,293 --> 00:38:52,126
And this man,
he did what?

400
00:38:55,266 --> 00:38:59,430
I don't want to sound crazy,
especially to a police psychiatrist,

401
00:38:59,470 --> 00:39:01,529
<i>but for the first time in my life</i>

402
00:39:01,572 --> 00:39:05,235
I feel like I don't know
what I'm standing on.

403
00:39:05,276 --> 00:39:07,471
Or what I'm supposed to think.

404
00:39:07,511 --> 00:39:11,311
Just tell me what happened.

405
00:39:11,349 --> 00:39:13,340
He took some bare wires.

406
00:39:13,384 --> 00:39:15,818
It looked like
he was gonna electrocute himself.

407
00:39:15,853 --> 00:39:17,753
Did he?

408
00:39:20,524 --> 00:39:23,721
Not exactly.

409
00:39:23,761 --> 00:39:25,752
But you thought

410
00:39:25,796 --> 00:39:27,787
that he might hurt himself

411
00:39:27,832 --> 00:39:29,823
or you?

412
00:39:29,867 --> 00:39:31,858
Yes.

413
00:39:31,902 --> 00:39:33,893
That's it?

414
00:39:40,778 --> 00:39:42,507
Well,

415
00:39:42,546 --> 00:39:45,515
<i>I think you were right
the first time.</i>

416
00:39:45,549 --> 00:39:48,484
Say this man is a suspect.

417
00:39:48,519 --> 00:39:50,510
Say he is the Surgeon himself

418
00:39:50,554 --> 00:39:52,283
and you have him at gun point.

419
00:39:52,323 --> 00:39:54,314
<i>The man you described,
enigmatic,</i>

420
00:39:54,358 --> 00:39:56,451
<i>mysterious.</i>

421
00:39:56,494 --> 00:39:58,485
You know,
like a ghost,

422
00:39:58,529 --> 00:40:00,394
he's just suddenly there.

423
00:40:00,431 --> 00:40:02,296
You think it was a trick.

424
00:40:02,333 --> 00:40:04,824
How else
do you survive 120 volts?

425
00:40:08,973 --> 00:40:12,101
<i>What happened after the fireworks?</i>

426
00:40:12,143 --> 00:40:15,010
I lost track of him.

427
00:40:15,045 --> 00:40:18,606
In other words,
he performed a little slight of hand.

428
00:40:18,649 --> 00:40:21,140
He fooled you
and bought himself an escape route.

429
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:25,582
I saw what he wanted me to see.

430
00:40:25,623 --> 00:40:29,115
Maybe what you
wanted to see too.

431
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:32,527
You know, we'd all like to know
there's an unknown.

432
00:40:32,563 --> 00:40:34,554
A heaven,

433
00:40:34,598 --> 00:40:36,589
<i>a tooth fairy,</i>

434
00:40:36,634 --> 00:40:38,625
<i>a reliable man.</i>

435
00:40:56,454 --> 00:40:59,480
Okay, partner. So, now do you
want to tell me why we're here?

436
00:40:59,523 --> 00:41:01,514
Bobby Allwyne was in despair.

437
00:41:01,559 --> 00:41:04,494
He wanted to die,
but he couldn't kill himself.

438
00:41:04,528 --> 00:41:06,519
So you're buying
into Harker's theory?

439
00:41:06,564 --> 00:41:08,555
Yeah, partly.

440
00:41:11,569 --> 00:41:14,504
Allwyne kept hundreds of these,
all from different funerals.

441
00:41:14,538 --> 00:41:16,267
What's that?

442
00:41:16,307 --> 00:41:18,298
<i>Death appealed to him
and to the killer.</i>

443
00:41:18,342 --> 00:41:21,869
Thinking he and the Surgeon
shared a similar psychology.

444
00:41:21,912 --> 00:41:24,472
Based on what?

445
00:41:24,515 --> 00:41:27,040
My inner psychic.

446
00:41:27,084 --> 00:41:29,075
<i>Funeral Director:
I felt sorry for him.</i>

447
00:41:29,119 --> 00:41:31,110
So many of his friends
were dying.

448
00:41:31,155 --> 00:41:33,555
Then I realized he didn't even know
any of the deceased.

449
00:41:35,259 --> 00:41:38,592
So what, he just gets his kicks
hanging around dead people?

450
00:41:38,629 --> 00:41:42,292
He just seemed to get
some sort of solace being here.

451
00:41:43,501 --> 00:41:47,460
- Did you speak to him?
- Just, "Good afternoon. "

452
00:41:47,505 --> 00:41:49,496
"Sorry for your loss. "

453
00:41:49,540 --> 00:41:52,475
I didn't let on that I knew
he had no business here.

454
00:41:52,510 --> 00:41:54,501
<i>He seemed harmless.</i>

455
00:41:54,545 --> 00:41:56,536
<i>Very respectful.</i>

456
00:41:56,580 --> 00:41:59,048
Sometimes they were the only ones
here to send someone off.

457
00:41:59,083 --> 00:42:01,483
They?

458
00:42:01,519 --> 00:42:04,010
He had a friend who'd come
with him sometimes.

459
00:42:05,923 --> 00:42:07,914
Can you, uh...

460
00:42:10,427 --> 00:42:14,090
<i>- describe this friend?
- Sure. Um...</i>

461
00:42:14,131 --> 00:42:16,122
He was ordinary.

462
00:42:16,166 --> 00:42:18,532
Average height.

463
00:42:18,569 --> 00:42:20,560
<i>Average weight.</i>

464
00:42:20,604 --> 00:42:22,731
<i>Middle-aged.</i>

465
00:42:22,773 --> 00:42:25,401
And brown hair.
Maybe blond.

466
00:42:28,245 --> 00:42:30,236
Good as a photo.

467
00:42:30,281 --> 00:42:32,374
I've got a sharp eye for detail.

468
00:42:32,416 --> 00:42:34,407
<i>I see that.</i>

469
00:42:34,451 --> 00:42:36,442
<i>It's a gift.</i>

470
00:42:38,522 --> 00:42:41,150
Sloane.

471
00:42:41,191 --> 00:42:43,182
What?

472
00:42:43,227 --> 00:42:46,390
When?

473
00:42:46,430 --> 00:42:48,261
Okay, yeah.
No, I'll tell her.

474
00:42:50,868 --> 00:42:53,302
That was Jack Rogers.
There was a fire at the morgue.

475
00:42:53,337 --> 00:42:55,066
Allwyne's body?

476
00:42:55,105 --> 00:42:57,335
Everything's gone.
Autopsy reports, photos.

477
00:42:57,374 --> 00:43:00,104
Everything. They say it was electrical.
A short in a wire.

478
00:43:00,144 --> 00:43:03,045
That's par for the course on this one.

479
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:06,311
Have you ever felt like you saw something
out of the corner of your eye,

480
00:43:06,350 --> 00:43:08,875
and then when you looked
it was gone?

481
00:43:11,021 --> 00:43:13,512
<i>I want to know what that was.
I need to know what it was.</i>

482
00:43:13,557 --> 00:43:15,650
Carson, we're partners, okay?

483
00:43:15,693 --> 00:43:18,025
If you don't tell me
what's going on inside your head,

484
00:43:18,062 --> 00:43:20,963
- how can I cover your back?
- I want to tell you, Michael.

485
00:43:20,998 --> 00:43:23,057
<i>I just don't know what to tell you,
you know?</i>

486
00:43:23,100 --> 00:43:25,660
<i>I don't want you to think
I'm crazy.</i>

487
00:43:25,703 --> 00:43:27,694
Too late.

488
00:43:34,078 --> 00:43:35,568
<i>O'Conner:
Vicky,</i>

489
00:43:35,613 --> 00:43:38,104
<i>how many times have I told you
to keep the door locked?</i>

490
00:43:38,148 --> 00:43:41,117
- What do you mean?
- The door was wide open.

491
00:43:41,151 --> 00:43:44,518
I locked it after you left,
like I always do.

492
00:43:44,555 --> 00:43:46,546
You know
he could wander off.

493
00:43:51,595 --> 00:43:53,586
Anthony,
you okay?

494
00:44:01,438 --> 00:44:03,804
- Did you go to the movies?
- No.

495
00:44:06,543 --> 00:44:08,943
Honey, was somebody here?

496
00:45:20,084 --> 00:45:22,484
Keep your hands
where I can see them!

497
00:45:26,490 --> 00:45:28,583
What were you doing
in my house?

498
00:45:29,626 --> 00:45:31,617
From what I've seen
of how you live,

499
00:45:31,662 --> 00:45:33,459
I think I can trust you.

500
00:45:33,497 --> 00:45:36,489
<i>Your brother
is a heavy burden.</i>

501
00:45:36,533 --> 00:45:38,899
You carry him with grace.

502
00:45:38,936 --> 00:45:41,871
You are not in my life!

503
00:45:41,905 --> 00:45:43,896
I mean no harm to you
or to your brother.

504
00:45:45,709 --> 00:45:47,700
Your enemy is Victor Helios.

505
00:45:49,780 --> 00:45:51,771
<i>You know the name.</i>

506
00:45:51,815 --> 00:45:53,942
Made his money in medicine
or something.

507
00:45:53,984 --> 00:45:55,611
He made me.

508
00:45:58,589 --> 00:46:00,580
You see things
you can't explain,

509
00:46:00,624 --> 00:46:02,854
and you tell yourself
not to believe your eyes.

510
00:46:02,893 --> 00:46:06,385
Yet in your heart
you want them to be true.

511
00:46:06,430 --> 00:46:08,421
Victor Helios made me.

512
00:46:10,601 --> 00:46:14,059
<i>He made Bobby Allwyne
and the killer you're after.</i>

513
00:46:14,104 --> 00:46:16,834
Victor Helios is some kind
of Frankenstein?

514
00:46:16,874 --> 00:46:19,900
Frankenstein is a fiction
based on fact.

515
00:46:19,943 --> 00:46:22,844
Victor Helios is that fact.

516
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:24,507
And he's 200 years old?

517
00:46:24,548 --> 00:46:26,539
As am I.

518
00:46:26,583 --> 00:46:29,518
I was his first.

519
00:46:29,553 --> 00:46:32,317
How he's still alive,
I do not understand.

520
00:46:32,356 --> 00:46:34,517
<i>He must be using his science
on himself.</i>

521
00:46:34,558 --> 00:46:36,549
And what about you?

522
00:46:38,796 --> 00:46:42,027
Perhaps the lightning, something
even more powerful than my maker,

523
00:46:42,065 --> 00:46:45,466
gave me this blessing.

524
00:46:45,502 --> 00:46:47,367
This curse.

525
00:46:48,972 --> 00:46:51,133
Tell me about the Surgeon.

526
00:46:51,175 --> 00:46:53,336
You said
you understood his pain.

527
00:46:53,377 --> 00:46:55,845
He was friends
with Bobby Allwyne.

528
00:46:55,879 --> 00:46:59,645
They shared a death wish.

529
00:46:59,683 --> 00:47:01,674
He wants you to catch him.

530
00:47:01,718 --> 00:47:03,709
He wants you to end his pain.

531
00:47:05,689 --> 00:47:08,157
I'm not the monster anymore.

532
00:47:08,192 --> 00:47:11,252
I'm your best hope.

533
00:47:28,478 --> 00:47:30,469
This is where you really live.

534
00:47:36,787 --> 00:47:39,585
<i>Helios:
What are you doing here?</i>

535
00:47:39,623 --> 00:47:42,251
Is this where I was...

536
00:47:42,292 --> 00:47:44,283
<i>born?</i>

537
00:47:44,328 --> 00:47:46,319
<i>I don't remember.</i>

538
00:47:46,363 --> 00:47:49,298
It was my gift to you.

539
00:47:49,333 --> 00:47:52,894
But I have nightmares about it.

540
00:47:52,936 --> 00:47:54,927
It's all a nightmare.

541
00:48:02,412 --> 00:48:04,403
You don't really mean that.

542
00:48:08,752 --> 00:48:10,743
You had such high hopes for me.

543
00:48:14,024 --> 00:48:16,015
Such vision.

544
00:48:19,830 --> 00:48:21,821
I failed you.

545
00:48:21,865 --> 00:48:23,856
You haven't failed.

546
00:48:26,570 --> 00:48:29,368
You have yet to fulfill
your potential.

547
00:48:29,406 --> 00:48:31,397
No.

548
00:48:31,441 --> 00:48:33,432
Victor.

549
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:38,471
Please...

550
00:48:42,552 --> 00:48:44,543
let me go.

551
00:49:00,771 --> 00:49:03,001
I don't suppose there's any point
in asking you

552
00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:05,201
why you dragged me out of bed
in the middle of the night?

553
00:49:05,242 --> 00:49:07,233
I got a tip on the Surgeon.

554
00:49:07,277 --> 00:49:09,268
Wha... What tip?

555
00:49:09,313 --> 00:49:11,304
Frye's pulling third shift.

556
00:49:11,348 --> 00:49:13,339
<i>We need to ask a few questions.</i>

557
00:49:16,620 --> 00:49:18,019
<i>O'Conner:
Frye.</i>

558
00:49:18,055 --> 00:49:20,216
<i>We need your take
on the Allwyne murder.</i>

559
00:49:20,257 --> 00:49:22,248
I don't care.

560
00:49:22,292 --> 00:49:24,283
- Ask Harker.
- We wanna ask you.

561
00:49:24,328 --> 00:49:26,159
I'm going home.

562
00:49:26,196 --> 00:49:28,858
Detective, unless you want to find yourself
in the middle

563
00:49:28,899 --> 00:49:31,163
of an I.A. Investigation,
answer my question.

564
00:49:32,736 --> 00:49:34,294
Are you threatening me?

565
00:49:34,338 --> 00:49:36,329
Yes!

566
00:49:36,373 --> 00:49:38,841
The Allwyne murder,
what's your take on it?

567
00:49:38,875 --> 00:49:41,400
I don't have a take on it.

568
00:49:42,679 --> 00:49:44,670
The black rooms,
the razor blades,

569
00:49:44,715 --> 00:49:46,706
what's your opinion?

570
00:49:49,820 --> 00:49:51,344
What black rooms?

571
00:49:51,388 --> 00:49:54,516
What razor blades?
What are you talking about?

572
00:50:08,939 --> 00:50:10,930
This is...

573
00:50:13,110 --> 00:50:15,101
difficult for me.

574
00:50:18,048 --> 00:50:21,575
<i>I'm a creator,
not a destroyer.</i>

575
00:50:34,031 --> 00:50:35,658
Yet...

576
00:50:35,699 --> 00:50:40,193
because of your sacrifice,

577
00:50:40,237 --> 00:50:42,569
there will be a better future.

578
00:50:44,708 --> 00:50:46,699
A new humanity.

579
00:50:49,379 --> 00:50:50,903
Perfected.

580
00:51:39,529 --> 00:51:41,656
<i>Helios:
Have sanitation pick her up.</i>

581
00:51:41,698 --> 00:51:43,689
She's in the main lab.

582
00:51:52,442 --> 00:51:53,932
<i>All right,
what was that about?</i>

583
00:51:53,977 --> 00:51:56,070
And try not to kill us both
before you tell me.

584
00:51:56,113 --> 00:51:59,480
The Surgeon and Bobby Allwyne
share the same psychology, right?

585
00:51:59,516 --> 00:52:01,006
- Okay.
- It's a death wish,

586
00:52:01,051 --> 00:52:02,985
as well as an inability
to commit suicide.

587
00:52:03,019 --> 00:52:04,509
An inability?

588
00:52:04,554 --> 00:52:06,613
The Allwyne killing
wasn't a murder at all.

589
00:52:06,656 --> 00:52:10,490
He asked his friend to kill him,
and now the Surgeon is asking us.

590
00:52:10,527 --> 00:52:12,586
- Asking us what?
- To catch him, to kill him,

591
00:52:12,629 --> 00:52:14,859
because he is incapable
of taking his own life.

592
00:52:16,500 --> 00:52:18,832
What have you done with the real
Carson O'Conner?

593
00:52:18,869 --> 00:52:20,860
It's sounds crazy,
but it makes sense.

594
00:52:20,904 --> 00:52:22,895
Based on what?

595
00:52:24,174 --> 00:52:26,768
I have a witness who understands
the way that they work.

596
00:52:26,810 --> 00:52:28,505
You have a w...

597
00:52:28,545 --> 00:52:31,139
What kind of informant understands
the inner workings

598
00:52:31,181 --> 00:52:34,082
- of a nut case with two hearts?
- An informant with two hearts!

599
00:52:34,117 --> 00:52:36,108
Okay, slow down.

600
00:52:36,153 --> 00:52:38,212
- And I don't mean the car.
- There's no time!

601
00:52:38,255 --> 00:52:41,156
I don't think the Surgeon will stop killing
until we catch him,

602
00:52:41,191 --> 00:52:42,886
and I think I know who it is.

603
00:53:10,720 --> 00:53:12,711
I like your singing.

604
00:53:12,756 --> 00:53:15,088
It should be the blues.
Party sucked!

605
00:53:18,428 --> 00:53:22,091
Harker: Oh, if only I could
be as happy as you.

606
00:53:22,132 --> 00:53:24,123
Jenna:
That's cute.

607
00:53:24,167 --> 00:53:26,158
Harker:
Are you locked out?

608
00:53:26,203 --> 00:53:28,194
Jenna:
Again.

609
00:53:30,140 --> 00:53:32,734
Harker: Why don't you come in
and I'll call the manager.

610
00:53:34,811 --> 00:53:36,369
<i>Sloane:
What evidence have you got?</i>

611
00:53:36,413 --> 00:53:38,404
I mean, Carson, you know
I trust your gut.

612
00:53:38,448 --> 00:53:40,882
But if you're telling me
that Harker is the Surgeon,

613
00:53:40,917 --> 00:53:42,908
then you have got to have proof.

614
00:53:42,953 --> 00:53:45,547
Harker told me about
the black rooms, the razor blades.

615
00:53:45,589 --> 00:53:47,989
I thought that he and Frye
had been there together,

616
00:53:48,024 --> 00:53:50,424
but they hadn't.
Harker had been there as a friend.

617
00:53:50,460 --> 00:53:53,020
He was Allwyne's funeral buddy.

618
00:53:53,063 --> 00:53:55,054
All right, now say I buy that.

619
00:53:55,098 --> 00:53:57,692
It's your next theory
I'm having a little trouble with.

620
00:53:57,734 --> 00:54:01,135
Prominent local citizen, Victor Helios,
creates life in a laboratory?

621
00:54:01,171 --> 00:54:04,436
- It sounds crazy, but it makes sense!
- How does any of this make sense?

622
00:54:04,474 --> 00:54:07,443
- What am I supposed to say, Carson?
- Say you'll help me.

623
00:54:48,151 --> 00:54:50,142
I want to thank you, Jenna.

624
00:54:50,186 --> 00:54:53,053
For helping me understand.

625
00:55:10,206 --> 00:55:12,299
<i>Sloane:
I've jumped off some cliffs before,</i>

626
00:55:12,342 --> 00:55:15,072
but this one's pretty damn high.
Okay, why the fire power?

627
00:55:15,111 --> 00:55:16,874
Remember Allwyne's body?

628
00:55:16,913 --> 00:55:18,403
Two hearts, bones like cement.

629
00:55:18,448 --> 00:55:20,439
Hard to kill, hard to arrest.

630
00:55:20,483 --> 00:55:22,917
Michael, it makes sense.
Harker has been dogging us

631
00:55:22,952 --> 00:55:25,716
about the Surgeon investigation
because he's the killer.

632
00:55:25,755 --> 00:55:28,246
Okay, look. That might explain
some of his behavior,

633
00:55:28,291 --> 00:55:30,691
but it doesn't make him
some kind of Frankenstein.

634
00:55:30,727 --> 00:55:33,161
Frankenstein is the doctor,
Harker is the monster.

635
00:55:33,196 --> 00:55:35,960
Right, I'm sorry.

636
00:55:35,999 --> 00:55:39,526
Maybe I am crazy,
but Harker is our suspect.

637
00:55:39,569 --> 00:55:41,560
He's armed.
He's very dangerous.

638
00:55:41,604 --> 00:55:43,595
We go in there,
we break this case.

639
00:55:43,640 --> 00:55:45,631
Then we jump off that cliff.

640
00:56:15,305 --> 00:56:17,296
Ladies first?

641
00:56:28,618 --> 00:56:30,609
O'Conner:
Harker!

642
00:56:47,504 --> 00:56:49,768
Harker!

643
00:57:24,207 --> 00:57:27,005
<i>Sloane:
What happened? What's going on?</i>

644
00:57:27,043 --> 00:57:29,034
What the hell happened?

645
00:57:29,078 --> 00:57:30,943
I don't know!

646
00:57:30,980 --> 00:57:33,744
He was lying right here.
He...

647
01:00:12,408 --> 01:00:15,138
All right.

648
01:00:15,178 --> 01:00:18,011
So, um...
you're sure he went off the roof?

649
01:00:19,482 --> 01:00:21,347
Yes.

650
01:00:21,384 --> 01:00:23,375
And he, uh...

651
01:00:23,419 --> 01:00:25,410
he hit the ground.

652
01:00:25,455 --> 01:00:27,047
And he jumped up...

653
01:00:27,090 --> 01:00:29,991
- and ran away.
- That's what happened.

654
01:00:30,026 --> 01:00:32,995
And how are you gonna write this up
without landing in the psych ward?

655
01:00:33,029 --> 01:00:34,860
I'm gonna lie.

656
01:00:34,897 --> 01:00:36,888
Oh, that's a good call.

657
01:00:38,668 --> 01:00:40,659
I should have seen this coming.

658
01:00:40,703 --> 01:00:44,002
Don't beat yourself up.
None of us suspected him.

659
01:00:44,040 --> 01:00:46,770
I'm responsible for officer evaluation
and counseling.

660
01:00:46,809 --> 01:00:49,369
In fact, I had Harker in my office
less than a month ago.

661
01:00:49,412 --> 01:00:51,073
I knew he was troubled.

662
01:00:51,114 --> 01:00:52,809
Especially when he didn't show
for follow up.

663
01:00:52,849 --> 01:00:55,909
No offense, Dr. Burke, but most cops
think mandatory counseling

664
01:00:55,952 --> 01:00:58,853
- is a waste of time, anyway.
- Just because Harker didn't show

665
01:00:58,888 --> 01:01:01,448
doesn't mean you should've suspected
he had hobbies.

666
01:01:01,491 --> 01:01:04,483
- How's the victim?
- I'm going to go find that out.

667
01:01:11,334 --> 01:01:13,598
This son of a bitch mostly
tore my thumbnail off.

668
01:01:15,371 --> 01:01:17,271
Better than having
my guts cut out, right?

669
01:01:23,513 --> 01:01:26,744
How long were you
Detective Harker's neighbor?

670
01:01:26,783 --> 01:01:29,251
I moved in 11 months ago.

671
01:01:29,285 --> 01:01:33,813
He was just a nice,
slightly older guy, across the hall.

672
01:01:33,856 --> 01:01:35,847
Did you see a lot of him?

673
01:01:37,060 --> 01:01:39,051
Once in a while he'd come over
for dinner,

674
01:01:39,095 --> 01:01:41,086
or I'd go over to his place.

675
01:01:41,130 --> 01:01:44,588
Son of a bitch could make
a mean lasagna, I'll give him that.

676
01:01:44,634 --> 01:01:47,728
Did he have any other friends,
that he would talk about?

677
01:01:49,706 --> 01:01:51,697
Sometimes I'd hear voices.

678
01:01:51,741 --> 01:01:54,073
Like he had someone over,
talking into the night.

679
01:01:54,110 --> 01:01:57,102
Mostly,
he was kind of alone.

680
01:01:58,815 --> 01:02:00,806
I actually felt sorry for him.

681
01:02:00,850 --> 01:02:03,512
Why did you feel sorry for him?

682
01:02:03,553 --> 01:02:07,421
He used to say something
was missing in his life.

683
01:02:07,457 --> 01:02:10,620
I told him, "Happiness is always
and option,

684
01:02:10,660 --> 01:02:12,651
you just have to choose it. "

685
01:02:12,695 --> 01:02:14,686
I told him he had to find his bliss.

686
01:02:17,567 --> 01:02:20,468
I never thought his bliss would be
chopping people to pieces.

687
01:02:24,073 --> 01:02:26,303
Police officer:
Okay, let me check my PDA here.

688
01:02:28,111 --> 01:02:30,545
Look, if you're gonna rip me a new one,
don't bother.

689
01:02:30,580 --> 01:02:32,571
I've done it already.

690
01:02:32,615 --> 01:02:35,379
Apology accepted.

691
01:02:35,418 --> 01:02:37,818
So you called Harker
after we spoke?

692
01:02:37,854 --> 01:02:40,049
<i>Told him we were asking
about the Allwyne case?</i>

693
01:02:40,089 --> 01:02:41,579
Yeah.

694
01:02:41,624 --> 01:02:44,252
Any idea where he might be hiding?

695
01:02:46,729 --> 01:02:49,562
Just goes to show how you can share
a squad car with a guy for years,

696
01:02:49,599 --> 01:02:51,464
and not really get to know him.

697
01:02:51,501 --> 01:02:53,230
I heard he made a mean lasagna.

698
01:02:55,138 --> 01:02:57,129
Since this is your case,

699
01:02:57,173 --> 01:02:59,164
let me show you what we found.

700
01:02:59,208 --> 01:03:02,336
- What?
- Where Harker really lived.

701
01:03:03,980 --> 01:03:06,471
According to the owner
this attic has been boarded up

702
01:03:06,516 --> 01:03:09,451
since this place was converted.

703
01:03:09,485 --> 01:03:11,976
Looks like Harker gained access

704
01:03:12,021 --> 01:03:14,182
<i>through the crawl space
above his apartment.</i>

705
01:03:15,358 --> 01:03:17,349
What did he use it for?

706
01:03:17,393 --> 01:03:19,384
Well,
that's his "go nuts-room. "

707
01:03:27,603 --> 01:03:29,594
Check this out.

708
01:03:34,143 --> 01:03:36,134
Sloane:
Pick your poison.

709
01:03:37,480 --> 01:03:38,970
O'Conner:
I pick that one.

710
01:03:52,962 --> 01:03:55,829
That's tasty.
Pickles.

711
01:04:07,043 --> 01:04:08,533
I'm guessing liver.

712
01:04:08,578 --> 01:04:11,445
That's a good guess.
Good guess.

713
01:04:37,907 --> 01:04:39,397
<i>That was...</i>

714
01:04:39,442 --> 01:04:42,240
beautiful.

715
01:04:42,278 --> 01:04:43,939
Accomplished.

716
01:04:43,980 --> 01:04:46,744
I have a long way to go.

717
01:04:46,782 --> 01:04:48,773
I'll arrange for training.

718
01:04:48,818 --> 01:04:50,945
Your skills will improve

719
01:04:50,987 --> 01:04:53,114
when you have proper guidance.

720
01:05:02,498 --> 01:05:05,228
Ballet is about precision.

721
01:05:05,268 --> 01:05:07,259
You need instruction.

722
01:05:07,303 --> 01:05:11,137
What I enjoy
is following my instincts.

723
01:05:17,813 --> 01:05:20,748
I don't think you brought me
into this world to be an automaton.

724
01:05:20,783 --> 01:05:23,081
I brought you into this world...

725
01:05:23,119 --> 01:05:25,644
to be my wife.

726
01:05:28,324 --> 01:05:29,814
I thought so.

727
01:05:44,040 --> 01:05:46,031
He lives here?

728
01:05:46,075 --> 01:05:48,407
- This is where I found him.
- It's cozy.

729
01:05:50,513 --> 01:05:52,174
Who the heck are you?

730
01:05:53,950 --> 01:05:55,747
<i>Woman:
Oh.</i>

731
01:05:55,785 --> 01:05:58,720
We're looking for someone.
A man with a scar and...

732
01:05:58,754 --> 01:06:01,120
You mean Deucalion?

733
01:06:01,157 --> 01:06:02,988
Just one name,
like Cher?

734
01:06:04,527 --> 01:06:07,121
Do you know where he is?

735
01:06:07,163 --> 01:06:10,064
Behind you.

736
01:06:10,099 --> 01:06:13,034
Is he the one who failed?

737
01:06:13,069 --> 01:06:14,866
Who let the killer escape?

738
01:06:14,904 --> 01:06:17,702
That would be me.

739
01:06:17,740 --> 01:06:21,073
I told you,
he wants you to catch him,

740
01:06:21,110 --> 01:06:23,237
but his instinct is to survive.

741
01:06:24,580 --> 01:06:26,172
We need to show you something.

742
01:06:28,050 --> 01:06:30,541
<i>Father:
I've wondered if prayer</i>

743
01:06:30,586 --> 01:06:32,577
might apply to us.

744
01:06:32,621 --> 01:06:36,113
I've wondered if their God
might watch over and guide us

745
01:06:36,158 --> 01:06:38,149
during times of crisis.

746
01:06:41,130 --> 01:06:44,122
That's why I gave you sanctuary,
it was the right thing to do.

747
01:06:48,971 --> 01:06:50,962
Morality...

748
01:06:51,007 --> 01:06:53,999
means nothing to him.

749
01:06:54,043 --> 01:06:56,341
- Or to us.
- I don't believe that.

750
01:06:56,379 --> 01:07:00,179
If we live by a moral code.
If we live the right way,

751
01:07:00,216 --> 01:07:03,276
there's a chance that we might
gain in spirit,

752
01:07:03,319 --> 01:07:05,913
we might join humanity!

753
01:07:21,704 --> 01:07:23,695
You'll never have
what they have.

754
01:07:23,739 --> 01:07:26,207
He's made sure of that.

755
01:07:26,242 --> 01:07:29,643
But...

756
01:07:29,678 --> 01:07:31,669
I've defied him.

757
01:07:47,763 --> 01:07:49,754
We've been denied the...

758
01:07:49,799 --> 01:07:53,098
ability...

759
01:07:53,135 --> 01:07:54,966
to reproduce.

760
01:07:55,004 --> 01:07:57,996
<i>He saved that for himself.</i>

761
01:07:58,040 --> 01:08:00,031
And I'm giving birth.

762
01:08:09,618 --> 01:08:11,609
Take a look.

763
01:08:11,654 --> 01:08:13,645
I'm giving birth to something.

764
01:08:15,524 --> 01:08:17,958
That's not conception,
it's some kind of mutation.

765
01:08:17,993 --> 01:08:20,086
It's an abomination.

766
01:08:20,129 --> 01:08:22,393
Hey!

767
01:08:22,431 --> 01:08:23,921
<i>I don't think you understand.</i>

768
01:08:23,966 --> 01:08:27,060
<i>This belongs to me.
- Go to him.</i>

769
01:08:27,103 --> 01:08:28,968
- This is mine.

770
01:08:29,004 --> 01:08:30,995
Go and see him.
He'll know what to do.

771
01:08:33,742 --> 01:08:35,733
<i>Stay here.</i>

772
01:08:39,782 --> 01:08:41,943
Stay here.
I'll take care of it.

773
01:08:57,133 --> 01:08:59,124
Father:
Sir, good afternoon.

774
01:08:59,168 --> 01:09:01,500
- Just good afternoon?
- No, of course not. Come...

775
01:09:06,308 --> 01:09:08,299
Why haven't I heard from you?

776
01:09:08,344 --> 01:09:10,335
Well, I have been searching.

777
01:09:10,379 --> 01:09:12,370
Searching for your man
in crisis.

778
01:09:14,984 --> 01:09:16,975
Did you find him?

779
01:09:19,822 --> 01:09:22,689
Sir!
Sir!

780
01:09:28,631 --> 01:09:32,294
As a student of faith...

781
01:09:32,334 --> 01:09:36,293
do you believe that God
can be deceived?

782
01:09:38,407 --> 01:09:40,398
No, of course not!

783
01:09:45,247 --> 01:09:47,238
Your parishioners...

784
01:09:47,283 --> 01:09:50,275
do you think they lie
to their God?

785
01:09:52,288 --> 01:09:56,019
They mean to keep the promises
they make, but...

786
01:09:56,058 --> 01:09:58,049
they are weak.

787
01:09:59,628 --> 01:10:01,118
Because they're human!

788
01:10:04,233 --> 01:10:06,827
<i>Helios:
One reason why you were born...</i>

789
01:10:06,869 --> 01:10:08,860
<i>to replace them.</i>

790
01:10:15,010 --> 01:10:17,103
You shouldn't leave
your windows unlocked.

791
01:10:19,281 --> 01:10:21,272
It's not safe.

792
01:10:24,286 --> 01:10:27,585
Did you really believe
that God would protect you?

793
01:11:20,442 --> 01:11:23,605
<i>O'Conner: Do you think he turned
to religion as some kind of solace?</i>

794
01:11:23,646 --> 01:11:26,410
This was chosen
for another reason.

795
01:11:26,448 --> 01:11:28,575
It held for him another meaning.

796
01:11:28,617 --> 01:11:30,608
Oh, thank you.

797
01:11:30,653 --> 01:11:32,814
You know, this place
was pretty well searched

798
01:12:12,261 --> 01:12:14,092
Sacred Heart.

799
01:12:14,129 --> 01:12:17,223
An ancient symbol

800
01:12:17,266 --> 01:12:19,063
can mean many things.

801
01:12:19,101 --> 01:12:21,501
What would it mean to Harker?

802
01:12:21,537 --> 01:12:23,528
The power of passion.
Of love.

803
01:12:23,572 --> 01:12:26,200
Renewal.
Resurrection. Hope.

804
01:12:29,244 --> 01:12:31,235
He feels
something is missing in him.

805
01:12:31,280 --> 01:12:34,078
He's trying to understand
what it is.

806
01:12:34,116 --> 01:12:37,017
So he goes to the library,

807
01:12:37,052 --> 01:12:39,043
he studies anatomy.

808
01:12:39,088 --> 01:12:40,885
Compares himself to other people.

809
01:12:40,923 --> 01:12:43,983
And what? Cuts them open
to get a better look?

810
01:12:44,026 --> 01:12:47,086
I don't think these are random.
These are people he knew.

811
01:12:47,129 --> 01:12:50,530
<i>Deucalion:
His victims are chosen carefully.</i>

812
01:12:50,566 --> 01:12:52,830
<i>Specifically for their completeness.</i>

813
01:12:54,470 --> 01:12:57,405
The first one was a school teacher.
The second one was a lawyer.

814
01:12:57,439 --> 01:12:59,498
You'll find Harker
was well-known to both.

815
01:13:01,377 --> 01:13:03,368
Someone Harker knew?

816
01:13:03,412 --> 01:13:05,175
Someone he thought was complete?

817
01:13:07,316 --> 01:13:08,874
I know who the next victim is.

818
01:13:25,634 --> 01:13:27,898
Harker...

819
01:13:30,839 --> 01:13:32,830
You don't want to answer.

820
01:13:35,244 --> 01:13:38,975
Harker,
you are very ill.

821
01:13:39,014 --> 01:13:41,175
<i>You need rest...</i>

822
01:13:41,216 --> 01:13:43,207
you need some sleep.

823
01:13:43,252 --> 01:13:45,379
You don't have any idea
what I need.

824
01:13:45,421 --> 01:13:47,412
<i>- Yes I do.
- Why would you say that?</i>

825
01:13:47,456 --> 01:13:51,256
You're scared and confused.
It's time to stop.

826
01:13:54,062 --> 01:13:56,053
I need what's inside of you.

827
01:13:56,098 --> 01:13:58,828
You won't find what you're looking for
inside of me.

828
01:14:00,869 --> 01:14:02,860
<i>- No?
- No.</i>

829
01:14:08,444 --> 01:14:11,880
- I... I fear I...
- Sit down.

830
01:14:11,914 --> 01:14:13,848
I may have injured myself.

831
01:14:18,454 --> 01:14:20,445
Harker, sit.

832
01:14:22,791 --> 01:14:25,919
- Okay.
- Okay.

833
01:14:25,961 --> 01:14:27,656
All right.

834
01:14:31,433 --> 01:14:33,424
Look,

835
01:14:33,469 --> 01:14:36,597
killing me is not gonna
help you find

836
01:14:36,638 --> 01:14:38,469
what you need within you.

837
01:14:38,507 --> 01:14:40,498
You wanna bet?

838
01:14:43,479 --> 01:14:45,140
I'm not lying to you.

839
01:14:47,816 --> 01:14:50,216
- Stop, please!
- I don't need what's inside of you.

840
01:14:50,252 --> 01:14:52,345
- It's not gonna do any good!
- All lies!

841
01:14:52,387 --> 01:14:54,378
- I'm not!
- Liar!

842
01:14:57,426 --> 01:14:59,917
I'm not lying!

843
01:15:01,330 --> 01:15:03,321
I'm not lying!
I'm not!

844
01:15:05,667 --> 01:15:07,862
Ah! I'm not lying!

845
01:15:57,753 --> 01:15:59,220
<i>O'Conner:
Kathleen!</i>

846
01:16:51,673 --> 01:16:53,265
He's there.

847
01:18:18,360 --> 01:18:20,351
Carson.

848
01:19:36,805 --> 01:19:38,932
Michael!

849
01:19:44,713 --> 01:19:47,682
Carson!
Take him out!

850
01:19:47,716 --> 01:19:51,208
<i>Carson! Take him out!
- Harker!</i>

851
01:20:06,067 --> 01:20:07,830
Michael!

852
01:20:37,032 --> 01:20:39,227
Are you a brother?

853
01:20:39,267 --> 01:20:41,167
No.

854
01:20:47,742 --> 01:20:49,733
Then what the hell are you?

855
01:20:53,548 --> 01:20:55,413
His first.

856
01:22:17,098 --> 01:22:19,089
I had them search everywhere

857
01:22:19,134 --> 01:22:21,967
and there is no sign of whatever
you think came out of Harker.

858
01:22:23,371 --> 01:22:25,362
So, uh...

859
01:22:25,407 --> 01:22:27,398
where's our special friend,
Deucalion?

860
01:22:27,442 --> 01:22:29,433
He seems to come and go
as he pleases.

861
01:22:29,477 --> 01:22:31,468
I don't suppose he'd...

862
01:22:31,513 --> 01:22:33,504
he'd like to give a statement?

863
01:22:36,551 --> 01:22:39,349
You wouldn't believe it anyway.

864
01:23:04,479 --> 01:23:06,470
You were here,

865
01:23:06,514 --> 01:23:08,505
working all night?

866
01:23:10,418 --> 01:23:12,409
Sometimes it's necessary.

867
01:23:12,454 --> 01:23:14,354
There's much to do.

868
01:23:14,389 --> 01:23:16,823
Well, the next time it becomes necessary,
call on me.

869
01:23:16,858 --> 01:23:18,849
<i>I can help.</i>

870
01:23:18,893 --> 01:23:20,884
<i>There's a phone call for you.</i>

871
01:23:20,929 --> 01:23:22,920
I had it put through
to your private line.

872
01:23:28,937 --> 01:23:30,928
Yes.

873
01:23:32,707 --> 01:23:35,699
This Detective,
Carson O'Conner...

874
01:23:36,845 --> 01:23:38,836
<i>Do we know who's helping her?</i>

875
01:23:52,293 --> 01:23:54,989
<i>Vicky:
Rough day, or night, I should say?</i>

876
01:23:55,030 --> 01:23:57,021
You have no idea.

877
01:24:02,971 --> 01:24:04,962
How's Anthony?

878
01:24:05,006 --> 01:24:06,997
Good.
Ate his breakfast.

879
01:24:07,042 --> 01:24:09,033
He's in his room.

880
01:24:14,582 --> 01:24:16,573
Is someone in there with him?

881
01:24:16,618 --> 01:24:18,609
<i>No.</i>

882
01:24:30,065 --> 01:24:33,228
Your brother sees deeply
into the true nature of things.

883
01:24:35,637 --> 01:24:37,127
He's autistic.

884
01:24:37,172 --> 01:24:39,163
Because he sees too much.

885
01:24:40,475 --> 01:24:42,534
Yet, not enough to comprehend
what he sees.

886
01:24:48,083 --> 01:24:50,074
Listen, uh...

887
01:24:50,118 --> 01:24:52,109
Harker's body...

888
01:24:54,089 --> 01:24:56,080
the evidence is gone.

889
01:24:57,725 --> 01:25:00,922
<i>He was cremated
about an hour ago...</i>

890
01:25:00,962 --> 01:25:02,987
<i>before there could be
an autopsy.</i>

891
01:25:03,031 --> 01:25:05,022
They're calling it
a "clerical error. "

892
01:25:11,940 --> 01:25:13,931
It's the hand of my maker.

893
01:25:13,975 --> 01:25:16,341
He can't afford to have
his efforts exposed.

894
01:25:22,317 --> 01:25:24,979
<i>- So what do we do now?
- For 200 years,</i>

895
01:25:25,019 --> 01:25:27,010
he has been preparing,

896
01:25:27,055 --> 01:25:29,319
perfecting.
I, too.

897
01:25:33,495 --> 01:25:36,328
Victor Helios
will destroy mankind

898
01:25:36,364 --> 01:25:38,355
and populate the world
with his people.

899
01:25:38,399 --> 01:25:40,390
His... creations.

900
01:25:41,903 --> 01:25:43,461
<i>If you do not help me,</i>

901
01:25:43,505 --> 01:25:45,496
he will succeed.

902
01:25:51,179 --> 01:25:53,170
Leave it to blind fate.

903
01:25:55,750 --> 01:25:58,412
Heads: You fight beside me.

904
01:25:58,453 --> 01:26:00,853
Tails: I fight alone.

905
01:26:04,592 --> 01:26:07,152
Screw fate.
