163
00:18:40,601 --> 00:18:42,983
-I don't have one.
-I don't believe you.

164
00:18:43,217 --> 00:18:48,324
-Is it in here, ha?
-No.

165
00:18:57,489 --> 00:19:00,680
-Is it hidden under your skirt?
-Why don't you find out.

166
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:36,497
Look, i don't know what to tell you.
I don't have any rooms, and i can't

167
00:19:36,697 --> 00:19:38,788

I told you this before.

168
00:19:38,988 --> 00:19:40,745
You keep coming back.
I told you to wait at least 2 hrs...

169
00:19:40,945 --> 00:19:41,945
Excuse me?

170
00:19:42,145 --> 00:19:43,568
...that's the best
i can do for you. Yes?

171
00:19:43,768 --> 00:19:45,664
-Cantrell came yet? I supposed to

172
00:19:45,782 --> 00:19:48,856
-What's the extension?
-Oh, God...

173
00:19:51,511 --> 00:19:56,367
It's 0219. Telephone is right over

174
00:19:56,471 --> 00:20:00,681
Ok, now the best i can do for you
is i get you the room in two hours.

175
00:20:44,977 --> 00:20:46,300
You have the right to remain
silent.

176
00:20:46,805 --> 00:20:48,146
I'll confess. I confess.

177
00:20:52,624 --> 00:20:56,710
<i>Anything</i> you say, can be used
against you <i>on the court of law.</i>

178
00:20:57,182 --> 00:21:00,435
<i>I'm guilty. Mmm...
I am guilty.</i>

179
00:21:48,439 --> 00:21:51,225
It's the new experience
for you, ha?

180
00:21:51,439 --> 00:21:53,624
I want you to go over and sit
on that chair over there, ok?

181
00:22:06,809 --> 00:22:10,804
That's it. You did good. Now,
turn your face to the wall,

182
00:22:10,875 --> 00:22:15,403
and don't say a word, ok?
Good, yes. You did fine.

183
00:22:15,959 --> 00:22:17,838
That's very good.

184
00:22:34,596 --> 00:22:37,605
-You were not supose to look.

185
00:22:37,684 --> 00:22:40,680

-Wait here, ok?
-Whatever.

191
00:23:52,608 --> 00:23:55,808
<i>Don' move anything, don't step
on anything, don't touch anything,</i>

192
00:23:56,008 --> 00:23:58,044
<i>until all the pictures are been
taken.</i>

193
00:24:14,588 --> 00:24:17,199
-I guess he never learned his lesson.
-Shut up, Al!

194
00:24:31,577 --> 00:24:35,244
Captain, i don't have to remind you,
this is a crime scene...

195
00:24:44,485 --> 00:24:47,064
-What next?
-How do you mean "what next"?

196
00:24:47,612 --> 00:24:50,749
How do you mean
"i guess he never learned his lesson"?

197
00:24:52,565 --> 00:24:58,801
Captain said, Art was ripp the
man for dating a prostitute.

198
00:25:05,243 --> 00:25:08,617
I can't breathe.
I can't breathe.

199
00:25:15,617 --> 00:25:18,456
-Captain? You allright?
-I can't breathe.

200
00:25:18,806 --> 00:25:20,848
Give me some water.
Do you want me to...

201
00:25:21,742 --> 00:25:27,476
-Here. Sit, right here.
-I'm tearing apart inside.

202
00:25:30,808 --> 00:25:34,244
I knew Art for 35 years.
He was my friend.

203
00:25:37,683 --> 00:25:40,652
-What a hell is going on here?
-Easy. Deep breathe, cap.

204
00:25:42,479 --> 00:25:44,601
So... so, where the hell is that
water?

205
00:25:47,601 --> 00:25:49,598
-Here you go, sarg.
-Thanks. Here.

206
00:25:50,009 --> 00:25:51,997
Easy now.

207
00:26:00,447 --> 00:26:02,532
I think i see one death too many.

208
00:26:04,532 --> 00:26:10,473
-He was my friend.
-I know.

209
00:26:16,193 --> 00:26:20,813
I don't know about you, how you
must feel. This must have been hitting you.

210
00:26:21,013 --> 00:26:24,071
Same as you and, um...
Sick.

211
00:26:30,464 --> 00:26:34,731
I lost somebody who was close
to me as Art was...

212
00:26:38,268 --> 00:26:41,218
Anybody know anything about
that, um...

213
00:26:42,447 --> 00:26:45,063
-That woman?
-No, nothing.

214
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:53,898
I just can't... i just can't believe,
Art was such a family man...

215
00:26:58,276 --> 00:27:02,605
-Skeletons.
-What?

216
00:27:07,605 --> 00:27:10,464
Skeletons. Everybody got one
in the closet.

217
00:27:12,422 --> 00:27:18,278
You don't know anything about
anybody, really. Till after they are dead.

218
00:27:21,001 --> 00:27:22,998
He was the best.

219
00:27:25,835 --> 00:27:27,622
He took a bullet for me, one time.

220
00:27:29,860 --> 00:27:33,980
The gun jammed, he stepped
in front of me. Got shot off.

221
00:27:35,378 --> 00:27:37,253
Took the bullet for me.

222
00:27:38,677 --> 00:27:45,650
After i got that desk job, i never
got a chance to pay him back.

223
00:27:57,195 --> 00:28:00,030
-Are there any suspects?
-Just a whore.

224
00:28:01,030 --> 00:28:05,601
Jumped of the balkony.
Hopefully we get ID from the prints.

225

232
00:29:21,917 --> 00:29:26,832
-I still can't believe that you jumped?
-Yeah, i can't tell you how spooky it was.

Hey, we will just have our own

and a deck of cards.
We will never have to live.

239
00:29:56,400 --> 00:30:02,278
Art was such a nice man. I don't
know why anyone would wanna kill him?

240
00:30:06,278 --> 00:30:09,059
I just keep thinking you know,

00:37:42,982 --> 00:37:46,482
You remember anything out of
the ordinary or anyone?

323
00:37:46,682 --> 00:37:48,278
Well, i remember 2 men standing
by that door.

324
00:37:48,478 --> 00:37:52,148
-2 men, standing by the door?
-Yes.

325
00:38:02,148 --> 00:38:04,639
-Hey, Al.
-Hey, how is it going, Jack?

326
00:38:04,839 --> 00:38:06,294
Well, it's going...

327
00:38:06,494 --> 00:38:09,438
Any description on the woman,
from Arts room?

328
00:38:09,638 --> 00:38:13,463
Ah, just a half naked female
who runned trough a lobby.

329
00:38:13,629 --> 00:38:16,053
Does gate keeper has anything
to contribute?

330
00:38:16,850 --> 00:38:20,834
Yeah, he said that he saw it
but, what can we do when we don't

331
00:38:21,034 --> 00:38:22,229
keep books anymore.

332
00:38:24,229 --> 00:38:26,065
Description was a little more
detailed when he told me about it.

333
00:38:26,603 --> 00:38:30,467
Look, what do you want me to do Jack?
I took down what he give me.

334
00:38:30,667 --> 00:38:33,781
Clerk said anything about any
golfers?

335
00:38:33,981 --> 00:38:36,752
Yeah, but he could not placed
them at the scene. I mean...

336
00:38:36,952 --> 00:38:38,241
... hotel is full of golfers this
time of year.

337
00:38:40,306 --> 00:38:42,199
I guess you didn't talk to the maid,
cuz she placed them 5 minutes

338
00:38:42,858 --> 00:38:45,808
outside his room before he
got shot.

339
00:38:46,008 --> 00:38:48,045
-A maid?
-Housekeeper at the hotel.

340
00:38:51,045 --> 00:38:54,007
I'll check it out. Thanks Jack.
Thanks.

341
00:39:04,534 --> 00:39:07,422
I don't believe this guy, rats out
on Lavery, now telling people

342
00:39:07,622 --> 00:39:10,493
-how they do their job.
-It's nothing.

343
00:39:10,693 --> 00:39:13,329
-"It's nothing"?
-Art was his partner.

344
00:39:14,329 --> 00:39:17,246
Yeah. It should be him standing
in that hotel room instead of Art.

345
00:39:17,826 --> 00:39:20,801
If Captain didn't put him in the
legal research, he would made it

346
00:39:20,894 --> 00:39:24,127
-through the week.
-Probably less then that.

347
00:39:25,785 --> 00:39:27,899
I would not bet on that.

348
00:39:39,005 --> 00:39:40,999
Hi, Katie.

349
00:39:42,899 --> 00:39:44,809
-Captain?
-Yeah, Jack?

350
00:39:45,009 --> 00:39:46,999
I make the composite of the
arsonist. I liked to release to the press.

351
00:39:47,199 --> 00:39:49,829
-Yeah, you wrep that up.
-Yes, sir. Umm.

352
00:39:50,029 --> 00:39:51,830
-May i speak to you in your office, please?
-Yeah, go ahead.

353
00:39:56,338 --> 00:39:58,055
It's about Arts murder.

354
00:39:59,052 --> 00:40:05,439
I think Sherwin is blowing it.
I got back to a hotel, i talk to

355
00:40:05,861 --> 00:40:07,832
witnesses, got information that
he did not have.

356
00:40:07,863 --> 00:40:10,151
-Or wasn't following through...
-We have been through this before.

357
00:40:11,863 --> 00:40:14,151
You are a sargeant in the legal
research department.

358
00:40:14,863 --> 00:40:18,151
-But, there's vital information...
-No, no. no, buts about...

359
00:40:18,863 --> 00:40:21,151
Sherwin has his job to do
and you have your job to do.

360
00:40:21,863 --> 00:40:23,151
-Stay out of it.
-What about the leads?

361
00:40:23,863 --> 00:40:25,151
I'll follow that with Sherwin.

362
00:40:26,863 --> 00:40:29,151
Look, i just tought, if there was
a way...

363
00:40:30,863 --> 00:40:33,151
You want me to be formal about this,
i will be formal about this.

364
00:40:33,863 --> 00:40:36,151
I am ordering you to stay away
from investigating all the witnesses

365
00:40:36,863 --> 00:40:40,151
in this case. Is that clear?

366
00:40:42,863 --> 00:40:45,151
-Yes, sir.
-Good! Now, get out of here.

367
00:40:45,863 --> 00:40:47,151
I've got a lot of work to do.

368
00:41:16,252 --> 00:41:19,281
-Channel 6? Ron Masters, please.
<i>-One moment, please.</i>

369
00:41:21,252 --> 00:41:23,281
<i>-This is Ron Masters.</i>
-Hallo.

370
00:41:23,481 --> 00:41:26,281
This is detective Jack Flinder.
Do you remember who i am?

371
00:41:26,481 --> 00:41:28,281
<i>Yes, detective. We meet at the
department of fire.</i>

372
00:41:28,481 --> 00:41:30,281
Good. How would you like
helping me catch an arsonist?

373
00:41:51,376 --> 00:41:55,291
-Welcome to legal research, Jack.
-Are we...?

374
00:41:55,924 --> 00:42:01,438
We are subject of your first training
bulletin in sexual harrasment and eticks

375
00:42:01,638 --> 00:42:08,831
that is a still from state international
legation. But the research is all here.

376
00:42:10,501 --> 00:42:11,848
Yeah.

377
00:42:26,809 --> 00:42:28,851
Legal research?

378
00:42:29,051 --> 00:42:33,851
Oh, does a matter a fact he just
walked in. It's a woman.

379
00:42:36,809 --> 00:42:38,851
-Hallo?
<i>-Jack?</i>

380
00:42:39,051 --> 00:42:42,851
-Yes, who is this?
<i>-This is Mary, look...</i>

381
00:42:43,051 --> 00:42:46,851
<i>... i don't have a lot of time right
now, so i'm going get right to the point.</i>

382
00:42:47,051 --> 00:42:48,851
<i>I was with Art Cantrell the night
he was murdered.</i>

383
00:42:49,051 --> 00:42:51,851
<i>And the same people who murdered
him, are trying to murder me.</i>

384
00:42:52,809 --> 00:42:55,851
Really? <i>Can you prove that?</i>

385
00:42:56,051 --> 00:42:57,851
What do you mean can i prove it?
I was <i>there.</i>

386
00:42:58,051 --> 00:43:01,874
-Well, where are you now, Mary?
-Why?

387
00:43:02,414 --> 00:43:04,420
Well, i think we have to meet <i>in
person.</i>

388
00:43:04,620 --> 00:43:07,420
I wont do it. Not unless you
promise you wont take me downtown.

389
00:43:07,620 --> 00:43:10,420
You know, i can't make that kind
of a promise.

390
00:43:10,620 --> 00:43:14,420
I can identify one of his killers.
There were 2 white men dressed as golfers.

391
00:43:15,414 --> 00:43:20,420
Can you meet me at 5:30 <i>at a Staffords.
Get in the back entrance.</i>

392
00:43:20,620 --> 00:43:22,420
Ok, bye.

00:43:40,545 --> 00:43:41,841

394
00:43:45,545 --> 00:43:48,841
-Mary?
-Yeah.

395
00:43:49,041 --> 00:43:51,841
-I mean no, no. Lisa is my real name.
-Okay.

397
00:43:57,041 --> 00:43:58,841
-Call the police.
-You are the police.

398
00:43:59,041 --> 00:44:00,841
I did call the police.

399
00:44:02,944 --> 00:44:06,426
They are only interested in me so
they can arrest me for Arts murder.

400
00:44:06,944 --> 00:44:10,426
-What makes you think i wouln't?
-I trusted you.

401
00:44:14,944 --> 00:44:18,426

-Lets sit. Comon.

402
00:44:21,626 --> 00:44:22,626

Ask the waitress to get us 2 coffee,

405
00:44:33,843 --> 00:44:35,229
-Is that allright? Coffee?
-Yeah.

406
00:44:35,643 --> 00:44:38,229
Ok, why u don't tell me

407
00:44:38,643 --> 00:44:43,229
I was at Monica's apartment, door bell
ringed, she went to the door, i heard the shot,

408
00:44:43,643 --> 00:44:45,229
-and she was murdered.
-Wait, who?

409
00:44:45,643 --> 00:44:48,229
-Who's Monica?
-Monica is my girlfriend.

410
00:44:48,643 --> 00:44:51,229
I went to her apartment after
leaving the hotel, they found me

411
00:44:51,281 --> 00:44:52,999
-and they killed her...
-Alright, allright.

412
00:44:53,199 --> 00:44:54,857
-They murdered her and...
-Stop. Allright.

413
00:44:56,017 --> 00:44:58,067
Let's back to the beginning.
What's your name?

414
00:44:58,536 --> 00:45:02,508
-Lisa Cates.
-What were you doing at the hotel with Art?

415
00:45:04,969 --> 00:45:07,623
-You are prostitute?
-No, i'm not a prostitute.

416
00:45:07,969 --> 00:45:10,623
-Well, Tell me what where you doing?
-I am not a prostitute.

417
00:45:14,969 --> 00:45:16,623
How i know you are not envolved
in the murder?

418
00:45:16,969 --> 00:45:19,623
If i were, will i jump from the balkony
into the pool, leaving my purse and my ID

419
00:45:19,969 --> 00:45:21,623
behind.

420
00:45:21,969 --> 00:45:24,623
-You left your ID in your purse?
-Yes.

421
00:45:25,969 --> 00:45:27,623
Now you understand why i'm so
scared?

422
00:45:30,009 --> 00:45:31,993
Ok.

423
00:45:32,969 --> 00:45:35,623
Tell me what happened before that.

424
00:45:38,969 --> 00:45:42,623
2 guys dressed as golfers,
broke into the room.

425
00:45:42,969 --> 00:45:45,623
They had on Groucho Marx glasses.

426
00:45:45,969 --> 00:45:50,623
They shoot Art, one of them
felt his glasses, i saw his face

427
00:45:50,969 --> 00:45:52,623
-and he tried to kill me.
-Can you identified this guys face?

428
00:45:52,823 --> 00:45:54,822
-Yes.
-Good.

429
00:45:55,361 --> 00:45:57,014
-Here we go.
-Thank you.

430
00:45:57,214 --> 00:45:58,914
And for you.

431
00:46:10,541 --> 00:46:16,674
Why don't you tell me about this
other person, friend of yours?

432
00:46:18,541 --> 00:46:22,674
I went... I went to her apartment
after i runned from the hotel.

433
00:46:22,874 --> 00:46:26,674
They found me there.
And i know it's the same 2 guys.

434
00:46:29,541 --> 00:46:34,674
I am not crazy. I am not draging,
i am not lying to you.

435
00:46:34,874 --> 00:46:38,674
I need you to help find this guys.

436
00:46:38,874 --> 00:46:42,674
I'll do everything to help you,
but i am not going downtown.

437
00:46:42,874 --> 00:46:47,674
-Why are you so afraid of them?
-Because they know thing about me.

438
00:46:47,874 --> 00:46:50,674
I am the perfect scapegoat.

439
00:46:50,874 --> 00:46:54,953
You take me downtown and you
wont hear a beep out of me.

440
00:46:55,153 --> 00:46:57,825
-I say you are restrained...
-Oh, that's comforting.

441
00:47:10,857 --> 00:47:13,325
I put you in the hotel for a couple
of days till i sort this things out.

442
00:47:13,857 --> 00:47:16,325
No! That's how Art was killed.

443
00:47:17,857 --> 00:47:20,325
Look, you loose me,
you loose your only eyewitness.

444
00:47:20,857 --> 00:47:27,325
I put you in my house, if i don't
uncover anything in 72hrs

445
00:47:27,857 --> 00:47:30,325
i'm gona have to take you
downtown myself.

446
00:47:49,072 --> 00:47:51,722
-This is nice.
-Thanks.

447
00:48:02,928 --> 00:48:06,431
-What do you thinking?
-That i must have known,

448
00:48:06,928 --> 00:48:10,431
that you and Art are meeting at the
hotel at that time.

449
00:48:10,928 --> 00:48:14,431
-Well, yeah. We had a standing date.
-Aha.

450
00:48:17,928 --> 00:48:20,431
You know, i resent that "aha"!

451
00:48:20,631 --> 00:48:23,247
Stop putting as a defensive, i try
figure this out as well as you are!

452
00:48:26,714 --> 00:48:29,606
In order to do that i have to put
you some question.

453
00:48:29,714 --> 00:48:30,714
Questions i don't mind, it's the
insinuations that bother me.

454
00:48:30,914 --> 00:48:34,714
I've been up all night, i am tired,
i am dirty and if you don't mind

455
00:48:34,914 --> 00:48:38,714
i would like to freshened up before
we finish up this little inquisition.

456
00:48:38,914 --> 00:48:41,714
-This is not an inquisition.
-Oh, yeah? Well, can you prove it?

457
00:48:43,606 --> 00:48:45,714
Bathroom is down the hall,
towels are on your right.

458
00:48:45,914 --> 00:48:47,714
Thank you.

459
00:50:00,821 --> 00:50:02,046
-Who is it?
<i>-It's me. It's us.</i>

460
00:50:02,246 --> 00:50:06,633
<i>-We are here.</i>
-Hi.

461
00:50:06,833 --> 00:50:09,069
<i>-Arent you gona open the door?
-Sure.</i>

462
00:50:10,853 --> 00:50:13,637
I think that Jackie Jack forgot ,
when he look through the window, he said:

463
00:50:13,837 --> 00:50:16,221
"Oh, no, what are they doing here"?

464
00:50:16,421 --> 00:50:20,829
I didn't forget, i, i just thought
they are got early then i expected.

465
00:50:21,029 --> 00:50:22,829
If you tell me you forgot, i wouln't
be surprised.

466
00:50:23,029 --> 00:50:26,829
-Disapointed yes, surprised no.
-Don't say anything, Jack.

467
00:50:27,029 --> 00:50:30,829
-I didn't forget, i didn't forget...
-Don't tell me, don't tell me...

468
00:50:31,029 --> 00:50:33,829
Let me guess?
A really bad time.

469
00:50:34,029 --> 00:50:37,829
I'm sure daddy if he know what a busy man
you are gona be, we be consolting with you

470
00:50:38,029 --> 00:50:40,829
for chosing his date of birth.
Maybe so he considerate that way that

471
00:50:41,029 --> 00:50:43,829
men are always thinking about
themselvs and that...

472
00:50:44,029 --> 00:50:45,829
-You must have a maid.
-No.

473
00:50:46,029 --> 00:50:49,829
-Are you ready?
-No. Umm... Yes. No, umm...

474
00:50:50,029 --> 00:50:52,829
-No, yes, no, yes, yes...

00:51:33,645 --> 00:51:36,282
When you put it that way, yes
he mentioned you.

483
00:51:37,645 --> 00:51:41,282

superficial, we are just modern family

484
00:51:41,645 --> 00:51:45,282

00:51:50,645 --> 00:51:52,282

00:52:01,362 --> 00:52:05,192
What better evening could you possibly

491
00:52:05,392 --> 00:52:12,192
Hanging out, on the fabulous yacht.
Drinking, dancing, going wild, yes.

492
00:52:14,162 --> 00:52:16,192
-I know.
-So?

493
00:52:16,392 --> 00:52:18,192
-Do you have a problem?
-No.

494
00:52:18,392 --> 00:52:21,192
Look at this girl, she is so resursfull.
She can take care of herself.

-There she goes.

I'm not pretty dressy.

501
00:52:46,151 --> 00:52:49,632
-They better look on you then on me.
-You could have got us out of this.

502
00:52:49,832 --> 00:52:51,434
-Don't say anything.
-What am i suposed to say?

503
00:52:51,632 --> 00:52:55,434

00:54:16,844 --> 00:54:20,644
-No. But maybe i don't see it that way.
-Well, i don't wanna tell you what to think.

532
00:54:20,844 --> 00:54:23,644
But if you don't see it that way,
you are kidding yourself.

533
00:54:23,844 --> 00:54:27,644
-See Phill Kitting over there?

535
00:54:33,020 --> 00:54:36,644
Could not carry your hat, but his
pulling down 6 figures.

536
00:54:36,844 --> 00:54:38,644
-Doing wants he must do, non the less.
-Wants?

537
00:54:38,844 --> 00:54:40,644
What a hell is that

538
00:54:40,844 --> 00:54:43,644
Isn't this what is about, dad?
Wanting to please you instead of me.

539
00:54:43,844 --> 00:54:46,644
I wander where you would be,
if i thought that way.

540
00:54:46,844 --> 00:54:49,644
Dad, did you ever wanna do
what you did not wanna do?

541
00:54:49,844 --> 00:54:51,644
Attend at your
police academy graduation.

542
00:54:55,020 --> 00:54:58,644
You are right son, you do
what you wanna do.

543
00:54:58,836 --> 00:55:00,294
Everyone got to die someday.

544
00:55:00,494 --> 00:55:03,068
I always tought there's an
exception made for me.

545
00:55:03,294 --> 00:55:06,068
Dad, it is your birthday,
do we have to do this?

546
00:55:06,294 --> 00:55:09,068
I just get a little frustrated at
sometimes.

547
00:55:09,294 --> 00:55:13,068
I have biggest law firm in the city,
and my only son don't wants part of it.

548
00:55:13,294 --> 00:55:15,068
-I can't believe in to.
-Kurt.

549
00:55:15,294 --> 00:55:18,068
Why you don't wanna be
rational and took...

550
00:55:18,294 --> 00:55:22,068
-Jack, you promised me a dance.
-I did.

551
00:55:28,294 --> 00:55:30,068
Your dads eyes turn
into a bloodshed.

552
00:55:30,294 --> 00:55:33,068
You cought my dad in the middle
of a conversation.

553
00:55:33,294 --> 00:55:35,068
No one has ever done that before.

554
00:55:35,294 --> 00:55:37,068
That's one of advantagous of not
knowing the rules.

555
00:55:39,294 --> 00:55:41,068
-Mind if i cut in?
-Yes we do.

556
00:55:48,294 --> 00:55:50,068
-What?
-Art said...

557
00:55:50,294 --> 00:55:54,068
you manged to turn silver spun
into a disadventage.

558
00:55:54,294 --> 00:55:56,068
I have no regret about it.

559
00:55:56,418 --> 00:56:00,459
So, you become a cop,
instead of going into family business.

560
00:56:00,818 --> 00:56:04,232
-Wich is what?
-250 million dollar worth law firm.

561
00:56:04,683 --> 00:56:08,588
Oh. I tought it was a
boat business.

562
00:56:19,110 --> 00:56:22,400
Jack. So, how are the things
in the underworld?

563
00:56:22,859 --> 00:56:24,686
-Full of surprises.
-Ah...

564
00:56:24,859 --> 00:56:27,686
Alisha, was just telling me how
you two meet.

565
00:56:27,859 --> 00:56:29,686
-Was she?
-Aha. She told she was a suspect

566
00:56:29,859 --> 00:56:32,686
-in murder case.
-It was a quiet day, so...

567
00:56:32,859 --> 00:56:34,686
-Good night.
-Good night.

568
00:56:35,859 --> 00:56:37,686
Nice talking to ya.

569
00:56:37,859 --> 00:56:39,686
Good night.

570
00:56:39,886 --> 00:56:41,711
-You are already leaving?
-We have another engagments.

571
00:56:42,075 --> 00:56:44,711
You know Jack, when he gets
the urge?

572
00:56:45,075 --> 00:56:47,711
I hope we made it to the car.

573
00:56:47,911 --> 00:56:50,711
-How are you gona get home?
-Axel will take us.

574
00:56:50,911 --> 00:56:52,711
-Who's Axel?
-Dad's shoffer.

575
00:56:52,911 --> 00:56:54,711
Let's get out of here.

576
00:57:00,741 --> 00:57:03,664
-Pinball.
-You mean Art had played pinball?

577
00:57:03,741 --> 00:57:07,664
Aha. I need it a doubles partner
until he talked to the machine.

578
00:57:07,741 --> 00:57:09,664
And then he told the machine:
"Over"!

579
00:57:10,741 --> 00:57:12,664
So the change went everywhere.

580
00:57:12,741 --> 00:57:14,664
You know, i never tought i would
get hurt by coins.

581
00:57:14,741 --> 00:57:18,664
So, he... a felt responsible for that.

582
00:57:18,741 --> 00:57:22,664
And we kind a started, seeing
each other a little.

583
00:57:22,741 --> 00:57:27,664
I guess you could say we had
an intelectual relentionship.

584
00:57:27,741 --> 00:57:30,664
-Geez, what's that?
-I don't know.

585
00:57:34,741 --> 00:57:37,664
I can't believe it i considered in
to order and buying that.

586
00:57:37,864 --> 00:57:41,890
According to me, this next bite,
i don't want it, but my tongue

587
00:57:42,090 --> 00:57:44,890
is sending a messages to my brains
with a sweet taste sensations there,

588
00:57:45,090 --> 00:57:46,890
therefore i eat.

589
00:57:47,238 --> 00:57:49,890
It's over there.

590
00:57:50,238 --> 00:57:51,890
Excuse me.

591
00:57:53,889 --> 00:57:56,885
-Tough breakfast?
-You know it.

592
00:58:08,001 --> 00:58:09,991
So...

593
00:58:12,001 --> 00:58:15,991
Do you heat it up first,
or do you eat it cold?

594
00:58:19,001 --> 00:58:20,991
Cold.

595
00:58:22,001 --> 00:58:24,991
With a lingering
flavor of cardboard.

596
00:58:26,001 --> 00:58:27,991
Juicy.

597
00:58:28,001 --> 00:58:30,991
Do i have to take you up for a
word for that?

598
00:58:42,001 --> 00:58:44,991
Bad idea.

599
00:58:49,001 --> 00:58:51,991

602
00:58:58,191 --> 00:58:59,191
My face is a problem for my
friends.

603
00:58:59,391 --> 00:59:00,991
I need to get to you, before they
get to me.

604
00:59:01,191 --> 00:59:02,191

He wants to meet me for a drink.

You got any plans?

612
00:59:41,956 --> 00:59:45,535

613
00:59:45,886 --> 00:59:47,093

-You came to me...

643
01:02:37,431 --> 01:02:39,231
You can't even get the DA on
the phone!

644
01:02:39,431 --> 01:02:41,231
Last call you make it, it
won't bee from the jail!

645
01:02:41,575 --> 01:02:43,760
-Why you call me down here?
-So we can make the deal!

646
01:02:43,960 --> 01:02:45,051
We are making the deal.
You are in so deep!

647
01:02:45,415 --> 01:02:46,415
No deal, man!

648
01:03:02,086 --> 01:03:04,146
Unbelievable.

649
01:03:05,086 --> 01:03:08,146
Tryed to put something together
and get shot right under you.

650
01:03:09,086 --> 01:03:12,146
At least he won't
light fires anymore.

651
01:03:12,346 --> 01:03:15,146
-Where is Durand?
-He is on his way.

652
01:03:15,346 --> 01:03:18,146
So, you get any more information
on who...?

653
01:03:21,086 --> 01:03:23,146
-On what?
-I don't know. I tought you said,

654
01:03:23,346 --> 01:03:25,146
he was the suspect in murdering
Art.

655
01:03:26,093 --> 01:03:28,507
-Yeah?
<i>-Is detective Flinder there?</i>

656
01:03:28,707 --> 01:03:30,559
Hold on.
It's for you.

657
01:03:32,559 --> 01:03:34,663
Hallo?

658
01:03:34,863 --> 01:03:36,504
I am on the corner on the 1st
and LA.

659
01:03:36,704 --> 01:03:38,293
I am gona stay here in case
we cut off.

660
01:03:38,493 --> 01:03:41,293
-Did you not see me blink the lights?
-No, i missed that.

661
01:03:41,493 --> 01:03:47,293
One of Arts killers, the one that i saw,
walked around the corner at the bar door,

662
01:03:47,493 --> 01:03:49,293
and then he took off.
He had a gun...

663
01:03:49,493 --> 01:03:52,293
<i>... and then just runned up
the street.</i>

664
01:03:52,493 --> 01:03:54,293
I must have missed something
like that.

665
01:03:54,493 --> 01:03:56,293
I know, i know, it's
not your job, right?

666
01:03:56,493 --> 01:03:58,293
<i>Come on! Come on!
Let's book!</i>

667
01:03:58,493 --> 01:04:00,293
That's the... that voice...
that's the other guy.

668
01:04:00,493 --> 01:04:02,293
<i>-That's the other man.</i>
-Man? What are you talking about?

669
01:04:02,493 --> 01:04:06,293
The second man. They killed Art,
and then he said: "Let's book".

670
01:04:06,493 --> 01:04:09,293
-That's just an expresion.
-No.

671
01:04:09,493 --> 01:04:11,293
Listen to me damn it!
Listen to me!

672
01:04:11,493 --> 01:04:14,293
On his wrist he has a tattoo,
<i>on his right wrist.</i>

673
01:04:15,289 --> 01:04:17,293
It's a domino, half a tic tac toe...

674
01:04:17,493 --> 01:04:20,293
Somebody wanna tell me what
a hell is going around here?

675
01:04:20,493 --> 01:04:23,293
-It's quiet a storm.
-I've gotta go.

676
01:04:25,289 --> 01:04:28,293
-What can you tell me, Jack?
-Captain, i need to speak to you in private.

677
01:04:29,289 --> 01:04:33,293
Well, hey, i can take a hint.
I'm gone.

678
01:04:33,493 --> 01:04:35,293
Sherwin?

679
01:04:35,493 --> 01:04:40,293
About this night, i just want to say
i havent been myself lately and i...

680
01:04:40,493 --> 01:04:42,293
had a lot going on and, umm...

681
01:04:42,493 --> 01:04:45,293
I havent been in my head mostly,
but i'm back and...

682
01:04:45,493 --> 01:04:47,293
I just wanna say thanks.

683
01:04:47,493 --> 01:04:49,293
-For understanding.
-Uh, well, hey, Jack...

684
01:04:49,699 --> 01:04:51,030
I'm always there for you.
No problem, ha?

685
01:04:53,009 --> 01:04:54,984
Thanks.

686
01:04:58,884 --> 01:05:00,261
-Can i talk to you?
-Yeah.

687
01:05:00,645 --> 01:05:02,812
I'm eagger to hear about
legal research.

688
01:05:12,645 --> 01:05:14,812
Sherwin was in on Arts murder.

689
01:05:15,005 --> 01:05:16,992
What?

690
01:05:18,645 --> 01:05:20,812
Him and insurence investigator
Kraus fon Zack.

691
01:05:21,012 --> 01:05:22,812
Are you out of your mind?

692
01:05:23,012 --> 01:05:27,812
Lyman before got shot, connected
Kraus fon Zack to Arts murder.

693
01:05:28,012 --> 01:05:30,812
Oh, you believe story of an arsonist
who's about to go to a gas chamber.

694
01:05:32,645 --> 01:05:35,812
-Go on.
-Kraus was also the shooter

695
01:05:36,012 --> 01:05:37,812
tonight.
He shot Lyman.

696
01:05:38,012 --> 01:05:39,812
You saw it?

697
01:05:40,012 --> 01:05:42,812
-Lisa Cates did.
-Lisa Cates? Lisa Cates!

698
01:05:43,012 --> 01:05:45,812
We identified Lisa Cates as a
prime suspect in Arts murder, Jack.

699
01:05:46,645 --> 01:05:48,812
-Let me finish...
-Where the hell is she?

700
01:05:49,012 --> 01:05:50,812
-She's safe.
-Safe?

701
01:05:51,012 --> 01:05:52,812
Safe?

702
01:05:56,645 --> 01:06:00,812
Jack, Lisa Cates is a lighthook.
You know what lighthook is?

703
01:06:01,012 --> 01:06:03,812
Lighthook is somebody who hooks
only when it's profitabile.

704
01:06:04,012 --> 01:06:07,812
To... To move some drugs, to
run a con, anything that works.

705
01:06:08,012 --> 01:06:10,812
She is tough and she is smart.

706
01:06:11,012 --> 01:06:12,012
Very smart.

707
01:06:12,212 --> 01:06:13,212
And you're over your head.

708
01:06:13,412 --> 01:06:15,812
Then how come Lisa Cates,
can identified Sherwin's voice?

709
01:06:16,012 --> 01:06:18,812
And a tattoo on his right wrist?

710
01:06:19,012 --> 01:06:20,812
There has been a second shooter
on Arts murder.

711
01:06:29,007 --> 01:06:30,997
Allright.

712
01:06:31,197 --> 01:06:35,997
Allright. If you gona pursued this,
i have no choice but to roll in it.

713
01:06:36,197 --> 01:06:38,997
But You, are gona have to bring
Lisa Cates in.

714
01:06:39,197 --> 01:06:40,997
-No.
-Yes!

715
01:06:41,197 --> 01:06:42,997
I'll put you in the witness
protection.

716
01:06:43,197 --> 01:06:44,982
-No...
-Listen! Listen to me!

717
01:06:45,182 --> 01:06:47,645
At least until...
i arrest and indict Sherwin.

718
01:06:47,780 --> 01:06:49,842
-Witness protection?
-Yeah.

719
01:06:50,042 --> 01:06:52,211
Half the cops out here, hate you
because what you did to Lavery.

720
01:06:52,411 --> 01:06:56,054
Now you are accusing a homicide
detective of an obnoxous murder.

721
01:06:56,105 --> 01:06:58,771
For a cop killing.

722
01:06:58,971 --> 01:07:00,914
It's is the only way for me to
keep you for not getting killed, Jack.

723
01:07:00,952 --> 01:07:03,376
Lisa Cates? Damn!

724
01:07:07,002 --> 01:07:09,996
Allright, listen.

725
01:07:10,952 --> 01:07:12,376
Listen to me, this is gona

726
01:07:12,952 --> 01:07:14,376

01:07:15,952 --> 01:07:18,376
And everything will be taken care of
so the earliest day to take you in,

728
01:07:18,952 --> 01:07:20,376

729
01:07:20,952 --> 01:07:22,376
-Yeah.
-Ok.

730
01:07:22,952 --> 01:07:26,376
Meet me at parking structure at
Royal Building on the 3rd level

731
01:07:26,952 --> 01:07:30,376

We will take you in, take your statements,

732
01:07:30,952 --> 01:07:32,376
and i'll take it from there.

733
01:07:32,952 --> 01:07:35,376
In the meantime, i want you to
go hiding, don't go home,

734
01:07:35,952 --> 01:07:37,376
just rent some room in a hotel
or somewhere.

735
01:07:37,952 --> 01:07:40,376
And don't you call me, i don't
wanna know where you are.

736
01:07:40,952 --> 01:07:42,376
How am i suposed to go out
of here without being followed?

737
01:07:42,952 --> 01:07:45,376
Well, i will walk you about 10 yards
or so...

738
01:07:45,952 --> 01:07:47,376
... and then, umm...
you are on your own.

739
01:07:47,952 --> 01:07:49,376
Allright?

740
01:07:49,952 --> 01:07:51,376
Let's go.

741
01:07:54,952 --> 01:07:57,376
I hope this turns out to be like
you said, for your sake.

742
01:07:57,952 --> 01:07:59,376
So do i.

743
01:08:04,760 --> 01:08:07,116
Ok, but how the shooter knew
where to find me?

744
01:08:07,760 --> 01:08:09,116
-You said he could followed Lyman.
-Could have taken Lyman anytime.

745
01:08:09,760 --> 01:08:11,116
Lyman? I don't understand what
are you saying?

746
01:08:11,760 --> 01:08:13,116
I am saying that Lyman led the
shooter to me.

747
01:08:13,760 --> 01:08:15,116
-Are you saying that i set you up?
-Did you?

748
01:08:15,760 --> 01:08:17,116
No! I tryied to warn you!

749
01:08:17,760 --> 01:08:20,116
-How?
-I flash lights just like you told me to.

750
01:08:20,760 --> 01:08:22,116
I did not see them flash.

751
01:08:22,760 --> 01:08:26,116
-This is not about me seting you up, is it?
-It's exactly what it's about.

752
01:08:26,760 --> 01:08:28,116
No, it's not.

753
01:08:28,760 --> 01:08:31,116
This is about people
letting you down.

754
01:08:31,760 --> 01:08:34,116
And you can't stand a fact that
they are wrong and i am right.

755
01:08:34,760 --> 01:08:38,116
Because you got this idea about
who they are not and who i am.

756
01:08:38,760 --> 01:08:40,116
And you just fit with what you want.

757
01:08:40,760 --> 01:08:45,116
Well, i didn't killed Art, i didn't set
you up and i am the only person

758
01:08:45,760 --> 01:08:47,116
who wants the same thing what
you want, but you just can't

759
01:08:47,760 --> 01:08:49,116
believe that, can you?

760
01:08:49,350 --> 01:08:51,710
What is it exactly that you think
i want?

761
01:08:51,910 --> 01:08:54,710
Well, i tought it was the truth,
but i don't know anymore.

762
01:09:44,532 --> 01:09:46,405
There he is.

763
01:09:49,088 --> 01:09:50,988
Jack...

764
01:09:52,984 --> 01:09:54,026
-That van...
-What about it?

765
01:09:54,984 --> 01:09:57,026
It was in front of Monica's house,
the night she was murdered.

766
01:09:59,008 --> 01:10:00,808
Duck!
Jack!

767
01:10:31,804 --> 01:10:33,295
Listen, listen, listen, listen...

768
01:10:33,804 --> 01:10:36,295
-Lisa? We are safe...
-No!

769
01:10:36,804 --> 01:10:38,804
Hey, listen to me...
Look at me.

770
01:10:39,004 --> 01:10:40,295
Look at me.
Lisa?

771
01:10:40,804 --> 01:10:42,295
Oh, no, please!

772
01:10:42,804 --> 01:10:44,295
Look at me.
Look at me.

773
01:10:44,804 --> 01:10:46,295
Deep breathe.

774
01:10:47,004 --> 01:10:48,995
Easy.

775
01:10:50,004 --> 01:10:52,995
I am sorry.

776
01:10:54,004 --> 01:10:56,995
I am so sorry,
i have doubt at you.
