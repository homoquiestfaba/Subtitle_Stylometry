1
00:01:57,779 --> 00:01:59,576
No, no!

2
00:02:01,516 --> 00:02:02,778
Stop, stop!

3
00:02:05,887 --> 00:02:07,912
Cut it out!

4
00:02:10,091 --> 00:02:11,786
Stop!

5
00:02:16,064 --> 00:02:17,998
- What's the matter?
- Nothing.

6
00:02:18,199 --> 00:02:20,633
I just haven't seen you laugh
like this in a long time.

7
00:02:21,102 --> 00:02:23,832
That's... it's nice.
I miss it.

8
00:02:25,573 --> 00:02:27,564
I miss it, too.

9
00:02:28,343 --> 00:02:31,141
We're gonna work
this out, right?

10
00:02:40,021 --> 00:02:43,513
Trevor, I hope it's everything
you want it to be.

11
00:02:43,992 --> 00:02:47,120
It will be. It will be.

12
00:02:51,332 --> 00:02:52,799
Oh, shit!

13
00:03:15,824 --> 00:03:17,519
Calm down.

14
00:03:21,196 --> 00:03:23,892
Trevor! Trevor!

15
00:04:05,808 --> 00:04:07,867
Help me! Somebody!

16
00:04:30,633 --> 00:04:34,125
No! No!

17
00:04:40,509 --> 00:04:43,376
No! No!

18
00:04:50,653 --> 00:04:53,281
It's nice to see you again.

19
00:05:06,101 --> 00:05:09,434
It's okay, Trevor.
You're safe now.

20
00:05:10,839 --> 00:05:12,830
Where's Kirsty?

21
00:05:14,243 --> 00:05:16,609
Where's my wife?

22
00:05:22,384 --> 00:05:24,909
This should help you relax.

23
00:05:35,230 --> 00:05:37,755
Just relax, okay?

24
00:05:42,805 --> 00:05:44,739
Trevor?

25
00:05:46,375 --> 00:05:47,774
Trevor!

26
00:05:48,978 --> 00:05:51,344
Trevor. Wake up, Trevor.

27
00:06:23,812 --> 00:06:27,304
- It's imperative that you stay calm.
- As you can see...

28
00:06:27,516 --> 00:06:30,576
the thinnest layer of cortex
separates the part of the brain...

29
00:06:30,786 --> 00:06:34,916
that feels pleasure from the part
of the brain that feels pain.

30
00:06:35,124 --> 00:06:38,059
Over the course
of this procedure...

31
00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:42,026
I will be triggering memories,
disrupting the unconscious.

32
00:06:42,231 --> 00:06:46,725
So our patient may
experience some distress.

33
00:06:46,935 --> 00:06:50,666
- What are you people doing to me?
- Now just relax, Trevor.

34
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:53,731
We're helping you.

35
00:06:55,711 --> 00:06:58,805
Helping you remember.

36
00:07:12,394 --> 00:07:13,759
Welcome back.

37
00:07:14,196 --> 00:07:18,030
How are those headaches?
Any change in the intensity?

38
00:07:18,233 --> 00:07:20,998
Oh, man, what happened?

39
00:07:28,011 --> 00:07:32,004
- My name is Allison.
- You a dream too, Allison?

40
00:07:34,851 --> 00:07:39,151
- Still hallucinating, huh?
- No, I was there before.

41
00:07:39,823 --> 00:07:43,122
It looked like a dream,
but it just felt so...

42
00:07:44,694 --> 00:07:46,161
Real?

43
00:07:46,796 --> 00:07:48,593
Yeah.

44
00:07:51,034 --> 00:07:52,831
It's probably
the morphine, Trevor.

45
00:07:53,036 --> 00:07:57,564
We're going to run tests to pinpoint
what's causing your headaches.

46
00:07:58,641 --> 00:08:01,405
With the kind of head trauma
you suffered...

47
00:08:01,611 --> 00:08:04,478
you're lucky to be here at all.

48
00:08:09,352 --> 00:08:14,016
- I wanna see you through this.
- I'm gonna take your word on it.

49
00:08:15,158 --> 00:08:18,059
Hello, Trevor,
back again, huh?

50
00:08:19,462 --> 00:08:23,592
- What seems to be the trouble?
- He's complaining of headaches...

51
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:27,361
blackouts, hallucinations,
acute memory loss.

52
00:08:27,570 --> 00:08:32,269
- I recommend that we admit him.
- I don't see any abnormalities.

53
00:08:32,475 --> 00:08:36,036
Time to ween you off those painkillers.
Wouldn't want you getting hooked.

54
00:08:36,246 --> 00:08:40,740
Start coming to the hospital for
getting a fix. We can't have that.

55
00:08:40,950 --> 00:08:44,511
I'm going to release you. Save
this bed for someone who needs it.

56
00:08:45,655 --> 00:08:49,421
Hey, Doc, where's Kirsty?
Where's my wife?

57
00:08:49,626 --> 00:08:51,821
That's what I'd like to know.

58
00:08:55,498 --> 00:08:57,125
I knocked.

59
00:08:57,333 --> 00:08:59,062
What do you mean she's missing?

60
00:08:59,269 --> 00:09:02,670
Oh, it's not like we're going
to stop looking, Mr. Gooden.

61
00:09:02,872 --> 00:09:05,898
- I don't give up that easy.
- Well...

62
00:09:06,109 --> 00:09:08,703
what if I took you back there,
you know, and walked you through it?

63
00:09:09,345 --> 00:09:12,280
We've done that already.
Over a month ago.

64
00:09:12,482 --> 00:09:14,473
What?

65
00:09:14,684 --> 00:09:17,847
You sure you're okay to drive?

66
00:09:18,888 --> 00:09:22,585
Look, obviously I caught you
at a bad time. Go home...

67
00:09:22,792 --> 00:09:26,990
get some rest.
You look like hell warmed over.

68
00:09:28,398 --> 00:09:30,127
Thanks.

69
00:09:32,168 --> 00:09:35,001
Oh, one more thing.

70
00:09:35,205 --> 00:09:38,299
You said you tried to pull her
out of the passenger side...

71
00:09:38,508 --> 00:09:42,103
but the door was locked, right?
Well, that's strange.

72
00:09:43,913 --> 00:09:47,144
Because report says...

73
00:09:47,951 --> 00:09:53,048
the doors were open when
the car was pulled from the river.

74
00:09:54,023 --> 00:09:58,426
I... Maybe she unlocked them,
you know, swam out.

75
00:09:59,395 --> 00:10:03,491
Maybe. I'll double check,
could be their bad.

76
00:10:04,567 --> 00:10:08,094
Anyway, gotta run.

77
00:10:08,304 --> 00:10:10,431
We'll talk soon.

78
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:13,770
You sure I can't
give you a lift?

79
00:10:15,078 --> 00:10:17,546
Suit yourself.

80
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:47,900
Do you mind turning that down?

81
00:10:52,048 --> 00:10:53,811
Right, ah...

82
00:10:54,651 --> 00:10:58,019
the music,
just mind turning that down?

83
00:12:42,726 --> 00:12:44,557
Why don't you come to bed?

84
00:12:52,469 --> 00:12:54,061
Hey, turn off the light.

85
00:13:01,378 --> 00:13:04,438
- I love you.
- I love you too.

86
00:13:46,557 --> 00:13:50,220
Well, well, well, look who
decided to show up today.

87
00:13:52,062 --> 00:13:55,088
Bankers hours.
Must be nice, huh?

88
00:13:55,299 --> 00:13:58,200
Hey, what happened
to you yesterday?

89
00:13:58,936 --> 00:14:02,133
Boss came by looking for you after
you left. She didn't look happy.

90
00:14:02,339 --> 00:14:04,307
Hey, I got a...

91
00:14:06,543 --> 00:14:09,376
You got a piece of ass,
didn't you?

92
00:14:09,580 --> 00:14:13,778
That's why you didn't come back
from lunch. We'll call it a...

93
00:14:14,184 --> 00:14:16,778
personal day, okay?

94
00:14:19,957 --> 00:14:23,256
Right, look, forget
I said anything, okay? Just...

95
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:27,055
get some numbers going,
any numbers at all will do.

96
00:14:27,264 --> 00:14:29,664
Hills have eyes, remember?

97
00:14:34,739 --> 00:14:37,401
We're all here for you, Trev.

98
00:16:14,739 --> 00:16:17,503
I can see into your soul.

99
00:16:17,909 --> 00:16:19,672
Hey!

100
00:16:20,511 --> 00:16:23,674
65% of all headaches are due
to low blood sugar levels, Trev.

101
00:16:24,515 --> 00:16:25,504
Yeah.

102
00:16:26,184 --> 00:16:28,345
Grab yourself a cookie.

103
00:16:46,170 --> 00:16:47,432
Come on!

104
00:16:52,243 --> 00:16:53,301
Now what?

105
00:16:57,081 --> 00:16:59,549
See anything you like?

106
00:17:00,318 --> 00:17:02,286
Well, do you?

107
00:17:02,654 --> 00:17:05,452
Come on, speak up.
I'm trying to run a business here.

108
00:17:05,657 --> 00:17:08,956
Right, I'm sorry. I was just
kind of spaced for a second.

109
00:17:09,627 --> 00:17:12,858
- Well, don't let it happen again.
- Right.

110
00:17:15,366 --> 00:17:17,994
- I may have to get rough with you.
- What?

111
00:17:20,104 --> 00:17:23,631
I know what you like.
Come on, Trevor.

112
00:17:23,841 --> 00:17:27,470
- It's me, Gwen.
- It's just moving a little too fast.

113
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:32,175
Don't tell me Mr. Mario Andretti
is giving me a speeding ticket.

114
00:17:32,383 --> 00:17:36,376
Hey, wait, my wife just died,
you know. We can...

115
00:17:36,587 --> 00:17:37,576
I know.

116
00:17:41,092 --> 00:17:43,253
It's perfect.

117
00:17:58,209 --> 00:18:01,269
Oh, yeah.
That's it, Trevor.

118
00:18:06,818 --> 00:18:10,448
- What the hell are we doing?
- Nothing we haven't done before.

119
00:18:12,558 --> 00:18:15,083
We'll pick this up later.

120
00:18:20,966 --> 00:18:24,231
Now get some fucking
work done.

121
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:30,905
We're watching you.

122
00:18:46,525 --> 00:18:48,584
Oh, my God.

123
00:18:56,635 --> 00:18:59,365
Oh, yeah.
That's it, Trevor.

124
00:19:01,707 --> 00:19:03,971
Oh, yeah.
That's it, Trevor.

125
00:19:06,078 --> 00:19:10,481
- Oh, yeah. That's it, Trevor.
- What the fuck?

126
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:35,363
Hello?

127
00:19:35,574 --> 00:19:39,101
Trevor, this is Detective Lange.
It's about your wife.

128
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:43,905
Trevor, are you there?

129
00:19:44,116 --> 00:19:46,812
Hello? Trevor?

130
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:49,988
Thank you for
coming down, Trevor.

131
00:19:50,756 --> 00:19:54,556
- How's that head of yours feeling?
- It's a lot better, thanks.

132
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:56,921
We still haven't been able
to locate your wife.

133
00:19:57,129 --> 00:20:00,826
Although Missing Persons turned up
some evidences that suggest...

134
00:20:01,033 --> 00:20:05,402
...foul play may have been involved.
- Foul play, what?

135
00:20:05,604 --> 00:20:09,062
For one thing. There were
no skid marks on the bridge.

136
00:20:09,274 --> 00:20:12,243
The tires were all intact,
and from what we can tell...

137
00:20:12,644 --> 00:20:17,672
there's nothing wrong. The car was
driven off the bridge intentionally.

138
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:21,747
I just, I just lost control.
And I swerved.

139
00:20:22,688 --> 00:20:24,952
We went off the bridge. I tried
to get her out, but I couldn't...

140
00:20:25,157 --> 00:20:27,489
Is there anything that
might have happened...

141
00:20:27,693 --> 00:20:30,685
just before that accident
that you haven't mentioned?

142
00:20:30,896 --> 00:20:35,094
Look, I've told you everything
I could remember. I'm sorry...

143
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:40,135
Don't take it the wrong way. I'm
just a guy trying to do a job here.

144
00:20:40,339 --> 00:20:42,933
I mean,
between your head injury and...

145
00:20:43,141 --> 00:20:46,941
and the fact that you're still on
some strong pain medication...

146
00:20:47,145 --> 00:20:50,478
you may have forgot something
that could help us and...

147
00:20:50,682 --> 00:20:55,210
everything you have told us could
just be the medication talking.

148
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:59,618
So, we'll be revisiting
things a lot around here.

149
00:21:00,626 --> 00:21:02,093
No, no, no!

150
00:21:17,409 --> 00:21:20,037
Trevor, you still in there?

151
00:21:20,546 --> 00:21:23,811
- She was trapped inside.
- Well, apparently, she got out.

152
00:21:24,016 --> 00:21:26,143
And therein lies a problem.

153
00:21:27,152 --> 00:21:31,384
I won't keep you.
If we have any more questions...

154
00:21:31,590 --> 00:21:35,117
you'll get a call from myself
or my partner, Detective Givens.

155
00:21:35,794 --> 00:21:37,728
You guys know something that I don't?

156
00:21:37,930 --> 00:21:42,458
All things considered, we probably
know a lot less than you do.

157
00:21:42,668 --> 00:21:45,103
Have a good afternoon, Trevor.

158
00:21:51,377 --> 00:21:52,867
Yeah.

159
00:22:29,315 --> 00:22:31,146
What's the matter, boy?

160
00:23:08,054 --> 00:23:09,646
Shit!

161
00:23:52,699 --> 00:23:53,688
What's happening?

162
00:24:57,764 --> 00:24:59,755
I did it.

163
00:25:02,435 --> 00:25:05,165
Well, what do you think?

164
00:25:05,371 --> 00:25:09,307
I was going to get it on my ass,
but I thought this was sexier.

165
00:25:12,912 --> 00:25:16,439
- Yeah, that's...
- I knew you'd like it.

166
00:25:19,153 --> 00:25:22,088
You know, I'm sorry, I...

167
00:25:22,723 --> 00:25:24,281
I'm having a weird day.

168
00:25:25,125 --> 00:25:27,525
- Really weird.
- Okay.

169
00:25:29,930 --> 00:25:34,264
It's definitely missing a woman's
touch that it used to have.

170
00:25:34,468 --> 00:25:37,062
Yeah. Well...

171
00:25:38,071 --> 00:25:41,905
Well, if you feel like...

172
00:25:42,109 --> 00:25:46,978
talking or whatever,
you know where I am.

173
00:26:04,498 --> 00:26:06,762
- Are you okay?
- Not at all.

174
00:26:11,205 --> 00:26:14,368
Strange, strange, strange.

175
00:27:03,657 --> 00:27:07,616
- How do you feel?
- What are you talking about?

176
00:27:07,928 --> 00:27:11,796
It's our anniversary, Trevor,
it's been five years.

177
00:27:11,999 --> 00:27:15,093
- How do you feel?
- I feel great. Why wouldn't I?

178
00:27:16,236 --> 00:27:21,367
I've got something planned for you.
I've been planning it a long time.

179
00:27:21,575 --> 00:27:26,171
Planning what? Why don't you
just come to bed, Trev? Please?

180
00:27:26,380 --> 00:27:30,714
First things first.
I have a little gift for you.

181
00:27:31,885 --> 00:27:35,616
Something to remind you
just how much you mean to me.

182
00:27:35,889 --> 00:27:40,155
I can't believe you got me
a present. It's beautiful!

183
00:27:43,430 --> 00:27:47,799
- Where did you get this?
- See if you can open it, Kirsty.

184
00:27:55,742 --> 00:27:59,576
I can't believe you got me a
present. You wrapped this yourself?

185
00:28:10,691 --> 00:28:12,318
Hello?

186
00:28:23,070 --> 00:28:24,970
Hello?

187
00:28:58,773 --> 00:29:03,267
- Miss me?
- You scared the shit out of me.

188
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:08,178
What's this?

189
00:29:09,283 --> 00:29:12,252
This innocent bit is
getting a little old.

190
00:29:12,854 --> 00:29:15,584
Don't you think?

191
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:20,250
Sit.

192
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:27,400
Don't make me beat you.

193
00:29:28,202 --> 00:29:30,193
Where is it?

194
00:29:30,705 --> 00:29:32,730
Where's what?

195
00:29:35,643 --> 00:29:38,111
You'd usually have it up
and running by now.

196
00:29:50,792 --> 00:29:53,727
Oh, yeah.

197
00:29:54,228 --> 00:29:56,594
You're a bad boy, huh?

198
00:29:56,798 --> 00:29:59,665
Yeah, that's the Trevor I know.

199
00:30:03,204 --> 00:30:06,799
Get off me.
Come on, get up, get up.

200
00:30:10,878 --> 00:30:14,109
- You're kidding me.
- No, I'm not.

201
00:30:19,087 --> 00:30:22,079
You have definitely
got a screw loose.

202
00:30:25,793 --> 00:30:29,194
You can say good-bye
to that promotion.

203
00:30:33,734 --> 00:30:37,170
That's it, Trevor.
That's a good boy.

204
00:30:37,371 --> 00:30:39,965
Oh, that's a good boy.

205
00:30:41,142 --> 00:30:43,872
I know what you like.

206
00:30:44,078 --> 00:30:46,171
Oh, Trevor!

207
00:30:46,614 --> 00:30:50,345
Oh, yeah. That's it.

208
00:30:58,426 --> 00:30:59,586
Yeah!

209
00:31:02,530 --> 00:31:04,930
Come on, Trevor.

210
00:31:09,871 --> 00:31:12,601
We're all here for you, Trevor.

211
00:31:16,177 --> 00:31:19,169
Hey, little boy,
do you like what you see?

212
00:31:23,284 --> 00:31:24,842
That's it, Trevor.

213
00:31:26,687 --> 00:31:29,485
That's perfect, Trevor. Yeah.

214
00:31:31,826 --> 00:31:36,388
- Gwen! No!
- Trevor! Trevor!

215
00:31:37,632 --> 00:31:39,691
Help! Help!

216
00:31:40,401 --> 00:31:42,301
Gwen! Gwen.

217
00:31:44,939 --> 00:31:47,339
Help me! Help me!

218
00:31:49,210 --> 00:31:51,235
No! No!

219
00:31:53,114 --> 00:31:55,480
Must be nice.

220
00:31:58,019 --> 00:32:01,420
- What?
- Getting paid for doing shit.

221
00:32:03,824 --> 00:32:05,815
You don't understand.

222
00:32:06,027 --> 00:32:10,760
I've got some seriously
weird shit going on.

223
00:32:12,133 --> 00:32:15,261
The accident fucked you
more than I thought.

224
00:32:16,337 --> 00:32:19,704
Hey, you know what?

225
00:32:20,841 --> 00:32:22,968
I'm gonna hook you up, man.

226
00:32:23,177 --> 00:32:27,011
She'll take one look at you
and know exactly...

227
00:32:28,649 --> 00:32:30,675
what you need.

228
00:32:34,590 --> 00:32:37,650
And look busy, all right?

229
00:32:39,094 --> 00:32:41,494
Anybody seen Gwen?

230
00:33:14,529 --> 00:33:16,997
Just relax.

231
00:33:17,299 --> 00:33:20,666
Let the needles
connect to your soul.

232
00:33:20,869 --> 00:33:22,860
These headaches
you've been getting.

233
00:33:23,472 --> 00:33:26,168
Do they happen in conjunction
with the hallucinations?

234
00:33:27,943 --> 00:33:32,380
Sort of. My head's been in constant
pain ever since the accident.

235
00:33:32,581 --> 00:33:35,516
And it seems to increase whenever
I get those, you know...

236
00:33:36,385 --> 00:33:39,946
- Dreams?
- No, more like nightmares, really.

237
00:33:41,623 --> 00:33:46,492
- It just seems so real.
- That's your subconscious talking.

238
00:33:46,695 --> 00:33:50,290
It's trying to tell you something
about your waking life.

239
00:33:53,201 --> 00:33:56,659
So, what's the mirror for?

240
00:33:59,641 --> 00:34:03,270
To help you look into your soul.

241
00:34:04,546 --> 00:34:07,242
I can see into your soul.

242
00:34:10,886 --> 00:34:13,354
You feel desperate.

243
00:34:13,555 --> 00:34:17,013
Trapped by a wife who
suffocates you with forgiveness.

244
00:34:17,626 --> 00:34:20,424
You're looking for a way out.

245
00:34:20,629 --> 00:34:24,156
- Yeah.
- Something final.

246
00:34:24,499 --> 00:34:28,765
Without remorse.
Without regret.

247
00:34:29,538 --> 00:34:34,407
Wherever there is hate,
violence, depravity...

248
00:34:34,609 --> 00:34:36,941
a door will always be found.

249
00:34:39,848 --> 00:34:42,316
This musical puzzle...

250
00:34:43,452 --> 00:34:47,786
created by a Frenchman,
named Lemarchand.

251
00:34:58,233 --> 00:35:02,294
It is a means to break
the surface of the real.

252
00:36:19,115 --> 00:36:22,050
Which do you find
more exhilarating, Trevor?

253
00:36:22,452 --> 00:36:24,784
The pain or the pleasure?

254
00:36:25,955 --> 00:36:28,856
Personally I prefer pain.

255
00:36:34,564 --> 00:36:37,226
Is there something wrong?

256
00:36:41,637 --> 00:36:43,332
No.

257
00:36:44,774 --> 00:36:47,208
No, I'm okay.

258
00:36:50,780 --> 00:36:53,442
Should I get that for you?

259
00:37:04,660 --> 00:37:09,063
- Hello?
- Detective Givens, Lange's partner.

260
00:37:09,866 --> 00:37:14,269
I don't understand. How can this be
a homicide when there's no murder?

261
00:37:14,470 --> 00:37:17,564
The last time anybody saw her,
she was alive. You think she's dead.

262
00:37:18,140 --> 00:37:19,903
Hey, Detective.

263
00:37:20,109 --> 00:37:23,408
I saw my wife drown in our car.

264
00:37:23,613 --> 00:37:26,446
Yeah. Right.

265
00:37:27,683 --> 00:37:32,086
I've done my homework on you. You
are smart with numbers, aren't you?

266
00:37:32,455 --> 00:37:35,288
- Where are you going with this?
- How many zeros...

267
00:37:35,491 --> 00:37:38,187
was your wife's worth?

268
00:37:38,394 --> 00:37:42,262
- We had nothing.
- No, you had nothing.

269
00:37:42,465 --> 00:37:46,162
She had a nice little inheritance
stashed away for a rainy day.

270
00:37:48,070 --> 00:37:50,300
I'm sorry, what?

271
00:37:53,142 --> 00:37:57,408
Don't play fucking stupid with me.
Kirsty's father and Uncle Frank...

272
00:37:57,747 --> 00:38:02,411
had several sizable financial
holdings when they passed away...

273
00:38:02,618 --> 00:38:07,385
under some rather
unusual circumstances.

274
00:38:07,590 --> 00:38:11,890
You know, I don't know. Kirsty
never liked to talk about her past.

275
00:38:12,094 --> 00:38:15,222
Well, maybe that's because
she didn't really trust you.

276
00:38:15,431 --> 00:38:19,060
It seems that she's the sole
beneficiary, so if Kirsty's dead...

277
00:38:19,268 --> 00:38:21,998
like you seem so fucking certain...

278
00:38:22,204 --> 00:38:26,573
well, then I guess it all...
it all goes to you, Trev.

279
00:38:26,776 --> 00:38:30,177
I swear to God, man.
I don't know anything about that.

280
00:38:35,151 --> 00:38:36,982
My partner...

281
00:38:37,186 --> 00:38:40,781
Detective Lange, he's softer
around the heart than I am. Me...

282
00:38:41,857 --> 00:38:46,123
I'm hard. When I get a feeling
about something, I'm usually right.

283
00:38:46,796 --> 00:38:50,163
I get a bad feeling
about you, Trev.

284
00:38:52,702 --> 00:38:54,602
Real bad.

285
00:38:56,238 --> 00:38:59,332
You're obsessed with that thing.
God forbid you let one event go...

286
00:38:59,542 --> 00:39:03,000
unrecorded.
Come to bed. Please?

287
00:39:03,479 --> 00:39:07,279
Please. It's our anniversary,
Trevor, come on.

288
00:39:07,483 --> 00:39:09,144
First things first.

289
00:39:17,860 --> 00:39:21,227
Just like I thought.
Nothing.

290
00:39:38,180 --> 00:39:39,977
Hey.

291
00:39:40,183 --> 00:39:42,151
- Hey.
- Can I...

292
00:39:42,486 --> 00:39:45,216
borrow something?

293
00:39:49,793 --> 00:39:51,590
- Yeah, sure. What do you want?
- You.

294
00:39:55,198 --> 00:39:58,167
You know, I'm feeling kind
of weird here, you know?

295
00:40:01,405 --> 00:40:03,202
God!

296
00:40:06,243 --> 00:40:09,076
It's getting hot in here,
you know?

297
00:40:12,649 --> 00:40:15,777
You are being kind of... weird.

298
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:19,179
It's almost like...

299
00:40:21,525 --> 00:40:23,959
Almost somebody else.

300
00:40:32,302 --> 00:40:34,099
Tie me up.

301
00:40:37,474 --> 00:40:39,442
Come here.

302
00:40:39,910 --> 00:40:41,707
Come on.

303
00:40:43,647 --> 00:40:45,945
That's it.

304
00:42:18,842 --> 00:42:21,208
All problems solved.

305
00:43:40,791 --> 00:43:42,918
Oh, man, you're...

306
00:43:43,127 --> 00:43:47,393
I have some serious space issues.
What did you want?

307
00:43:48,232 --> 00:43:49,790
Right.

308
00:43:50,635 --> 00:43:54,332
We need to talk, you know,
about what we did last night.

309
00:43:55,573 --> 00:43:59,236
- What?
- Who the fuck is it?

310
00:43:59,744 --> 00:44:04,579
- Who's in there with you?
- Are you having a nervous breakdown?

311
00:44:05,616 --> 00:44:08,483
Hey. What can we do
for you, chief?

312
00:44:10,354 --> 00:44:12,345
Who are you?

313
00:44:12,556 --> 00:44:16,492
If you know Tawny,
you better know me, pal.

314
00:44:17,128 --> 00:44:20,928
I'm sorry. It's my mistake.
Talk to you later.

315
00:44:25,970 --> 00:44:28,200
Let's make it much later.

316
00:44:33,344 --> 00:44:34,675
Get in.

317
00:44:36,380 --> 00:44:40,282
Hey, we're not in right now. Leave
a message after the beep. Thanks.

318
00:44:40,484 --> 00:44:44,386
This is Detective Lange.
We need to talk as soon as possible.

319
00:44:44,588 --> 00:44:47,853
There's been an interesting
twist in the puzzle.

320
00:44:52,029 --> 00:44:55,362
I'm telling you right now.
Sure as I am standing here.

321
00:44:56,534 --> 00:45:00,300
- No. I'm not concealing. Why?
- It's done.

322
00:45:03,441 --> 00:45:05,841
What are you doing
to find my wife?

323
00:45:06,043 --> 00:45:10,810
Well, I can assure you we're doing
everything in our power to find her.

324
00:45:11,015 --> 00:45:14,644
This investigation is gonna take
some time. I need your cooperation.

325
00:45:14,852 --> 00:45:17,582
What about that message
you left on my answering machine?

326
00:45:17,788 --> 00:45:21,656
What's your relationship
with Gwen Stevens?

327
00:45:21,993 --> 00:45:23,654
What?

328
00:45:27,732 --> 00:45:30,701
Yeah, thanks.
So that's all for me?

329
00:45:39,777 --> 00:45:42,405
- She was my boss.
- And that's it?

330
00:45:42,613 --> 00:45:44,274
Yeah, that's it.

331
00:45:44,482 --> 00:45:47,508
- What did he tell you?
- Nothing.

332
00:45:48,285 --> 00:45:51,743
We leave no stone unturned
around here, Trevor.

333
00:45:52,156 --> 00:45:55,592
- You think I did it.
- Hey, I'm on your side here.

334
00:45:56,694 --> 00:45:59,561
Would you please tell me
what the fuck is going on?

335
00:45:59,997 --> 00:46:02,329
I wish I knew.

336
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:04,927
Yeah, I bet.

337
00:46:38,269 --> 00:46:43,104
Once you choose to open the box
and unleash its power...

338
00:46:43,307 --> 00:46:47,607
there is no returning. Now,
are you willing to pay the price?

339
00:46:53,285 --> 00:46:57,517
No, the price is far greater.
But you'll learn that.

340
00:47:01,059 --> 00:47:02,822
They all do.

341
00:47:08,633 --> 00:47:09,827
Hey.

342
00:47:11,002 --> 00:47:14,631
- You okay?
- Yeah. I was just, you know...

343
00:47:15,240 --> 00:47:17,174
Can I get you anything?

344
00:47:17,642 --> 00:47:20,839
No, no. I'm okay.

345
00:48:03,152 --> 00:48:04,847
You okay?

346
00:48:05,054 --> 00:48:09,218
I don't know, Allison, I think
I really screwed everything up.

347
00:48:09,425 --> 00:48:12,417
Come on, Trevor,
you can't blame yourself.

348
00:48:17,767 --> 00:48:18,825
I miss her.

349
00:48:23,072 --> 00:48:25,870
I miss my wife.

350
00:48:31,180 --> 00:48:33,842
Sounds like you're remembering
more and more.

351
00:48:34,050 --> 00:48:36,382
That's a good thing, Trevor.

352
00:48:37,153 --> 00:48:40,088
Maybe you're not the angel
that you thought you were.

353
00:48:41,791 --> 00:48:44,589
Come on, you're going to
get through this, Trevor.

354
00:48:52,702 --> 00:48:55,466
Hey, Bret. Come here.

355
00:48:55,672 --> 00:48:58,004
- We need to talk.
- Look, I'm really, really busy.

356
00:48:58,207 --> 00:49:02,507
I've got a stack of reports due
by 3. The suits are all over my ass.

357
00:49:02,712 --> 00:49:05,044
- What did you tell the police?
- Nothing they didn't already know.

358
00:49:05,248 --> 00:49:08,081
- What's that supposed to mean?
- I didn't tell them anything new.

359
00:49:08,284 --> 00:49:11,811
Hey, Bret, why don't you help me
out here, man? I think I did it.

360
00:49:12,021 --> 00:49:14,182
- Did what?
- Killed Kirsty.

361
00:49:15,558 --> 00:49:17,890
I've got a report to do.

362
00:49:21,798 --> 00:49:25,325
- Let's make yourself at home.
- Oh, I already have.

363
00:49:25,535 --> 00:49:30,438
Oh, yes.
Why are you here, Detective?

364
00:49:31,307 --> 00:49:36,472
We found this curious object not too
far from the site of the accident.

365
00:49:37,613 --> 00:49:43,108
No prints. Forensics scraped a little
dark residue that was caked on it.

366
00:49:43,920 --> 00:49:46,650
Wanna take a guess
what they found?

367
00:49:46,856 --> 00:49:49,791
Ah, no, but something tells me
that you're gonna tell me.

368
00:49:50,226 --> 00:49:52,126
Blood, Trevor.

369
00:49:52,328 --> 00:49:56,594
Match the one we took from your car.
Can you tell me anything about it?

370
00:49:56,799 --> 00:49:58,596
I... it...

371
00:49:58,801 --> 00:50:03,500
It looks familiar. Like most
things. I think it was in the car.

372
00:50:03,706 --> 00:50:06,698
Gee, you think so?

373
00:50:07,910 --> 00:50:12,711
Think about it, Trevor.
Give me something to go on here.

374
00:50:12,915 --> 00:50:17,375
I've got Givens ready to drag you in
today on murder charges.

375
00:50:17,587 --> 00:50:20,920
Help me get him off my back.
Off your back.

376
00:50:22,091 --> 00:50:25,117
It was an accident, Detective.
Just like I've been saying all along.

377
00:50:25,328 --> 00:50:27,729
Somebody's got to believe me.

378
00:50:27,931 --> 00:50:31,059
- I believe you, Trevor.
- Damn.

379
00:50:31,268 --> 00:50:35,329
But so far,
I'm the only one who does.

380
00:50:55,559 --> 00:50:57,026
Hey.

381
00:50:57,461 --> 00:51:00,862
Look, I'm sorry, okay?
We need to talk.

382
00:51:06,069 --> 00:51:10,028
- What's up?
- It's getting weird around here.

383
00:51:10,240 --> 00:51:12,731
I quit, today's my last day.
I figured it was the perfect time...

384
00:51:12,943 --> 00:51:15,411
to say "fuck you" to the morons
around here, make a serious change.

385
00:51:15,612 --> 00:51:17,443
Oh, well, Bret, that's...

386
00:51:28,091 --> 00:51:32,187
Look, I know you got your golden
egg all lined up and that's cool.

387
00:51:32,396 --> 00:51:34,762
But the rest of us got to make some
hay for ourselves, 'cause frankly...

388
00:51:34,965 --> 00:51:36,694
this job ain't paying
the bills anymore.

389
00:51:36,900 --> 00:51:39,198
We're not drinking from the
cash cow like your wife was.

390
00:51:41,505 --> 00:51:43,439
What are you talking about?

391
00:51:43,640 --> 00:51:45,665
- What am I talking about?
- Yeah.

392
00:51:45,876 --> 00:51:47,468
The money.

393
00:51:47,811 --> 00:51:50,712
Don't play stupid. Her inheritance.
I'm talking about the plan.

394
00:51:52,416 --> 00:51:55,351
- Let's get out of here.
- Wait. Bret.

395
00:51:56,286 --> 00:51:58,516
- What did you tell Lange?
- Come on, Trev, what the hell's...

396
00:51:58,722 --> 00:52:03,159
No, no, no! Did you tell him about
Gwen? About the inheritance?

397
00:52:03,627 --> 00:52:05,993
I didn't tell them anything.

398
00:52:07,231 --> 00:52:09,324
We're all here for you, Trev.

399
00:52:19,209 --> 00:52:22,406
I trusted you, goddamn it!
How could you do this to us?

400
00:52:23,347 --> 00:52:25,042
God!

401
00:52:25,816 --> 00:52:27,443
Shit.

402
00:52:28,619 --> 00:52:30,814
Jesus, buddy, are you all right?

403
00:52:31,688 --> 00:52:34,851
- Shit, I got to go, man.
- Well, let me give you...

404
00:52:36,126 --> 00:52:37,787
a ride.

405
00:52:51,375 --> 00:52:55,744
Yeah, hello. Hi. I'd like to speak
to Doctor Allison Dormere.

406
00:52:58,448 --> 00:53:02,441
Hello. Yeah, hi. What do you mean
she's not there?

407
00:53:03,987 --> 00:53:08,822
She's always there.
She's a resident. All right.

408
00:53:09,026 --> 00:53:13,656
Can you please help me find her?
Please. Hello?

409
00:53:15,232 --> 00:53:16,756
Damn it.

410
00:53:26,310 --> 00:53:29,973
There's no physical explanation for
these headaches of yours, Trevor.

411
00:53:30,180 --> 00:53:32,648
Your body's completely healed.

412
00:53:33,250 --> 00:53:35,912
If there's any pain
in your head...

413
00:53:37,254 --> 00:53:39,916
it's in your head.

414
00:53:40,757 --> 00:53:45,421
Your soul is locked up inside you.

415
00:53:45,629 --> 00:53:48,826
And you need to free it, Trevor.

416
00:53:49,032 --> 00:53:53,025
You blocked yourself from the
healing process. We need to do that.

417
00:53:53,236 --> 00:53:55,704
Heal your soul.

418
00:53:56,807 --> 00:53:59,833
The only way to do that
is to give in utterly.

419
00:54:00,310 --> 00:54:03,075
Do you know what I mean
by giving in?

420
00:54:03,281 --> 00:54:04,908
No.

421
00:54:05,850 --> 00:54:08,114
It's about trust.

422
00:54:08,319 --> 00:54:11,880
Do you trust me implicitly?

423
00:54:12,090 --> 00:54:14,251
I don't know what's real...

424
00:54:14,459 --> 00:54:18,862
and what isn't real anymore.
How can I trust anybody?

425
00:54:29,073 --> 00:54:31,098
You can trust me.

426
00:54:36,848 --> 00:54:40,477
Surrender yourself to your past.

427
00:54:41,419 --> 00:54:43,979
It's the only way you can
become whole again.

428
00:54:50,294 --> 00:54:54,128
Are you willing to partake?

429
00:55:37,608 --> 00:55:40,236
Can you hear me?
Just nod.

430
00:55:40,845 --> 00:55:42,836
You know where you are?

431
00:55:43,481 --> 00:55:44,470
Ambulance.

432
00:55:44,682 --> 00:55:48,709
- You remember what happened?
- Some woman on top of me...

433
00:55:48,953 --> 00:55:53,447
...naked, trying to kill me.
- Ah, yeah, not quite that good.

434
00:55:53,658 --> 00:55:57,822
You were riding on a bus, and then
you just collapsed on the floor.

435
00:55:58,029 --> 00:56:00,327
- You remember riding on a bus now?
- No.

436
00:56:03,034 --> 00:56:04,763
Maybe.

437
00:56:15,246 --> 00:56:18,511
Hello, Trevor. Well,
what did you do this time?

438
00:56:18,716 --> 00:56:21,241
Oh, yeah, a couple of stitches
will fix that right up.

439
00:56:21,652 --> 00:56:23,711
Hey, where's Allison?

440
00:56:23,921 --> 00:56:26,788
Yeah, Allison Dormere.
She's a resident here.

441
00:56:27,992 --> 00:56:32,895
We don't have any resident called
Allison. My nurse will numb this up.

442
00:56:33,097 --> 00:56:35,691
I'll get right back to you.

443
00:56:37,301 --> 00:56:40,236
It's imperative that you stay calm.

444
00:56:40,872 --> 00:56:42,772
This might sting a little.

445
00:56:43,841 --> 00:56:47,277
- Just relax. Remember, we're all...
- Here for you. Go ahead, say it.

446
00:56:47,478 --> 00:56:51,505
I'm tired of this shit.
Tired of all you people.

447
00:57:08,900 --> 00:57:13,360
Okay, you caught me. At least
let me finish. I got one puff left.

448
00:57:14,172 --> 00:57:16,037
Knock yourself out.

449
00:57:19,277 --> 00:57:22,041
Trevor, I heard you were looking
for me. Is everything all right?

450
00:57:22,246 --> 00:57:24,237
Allison, hey.

451
00:57:25,616 --> 00:57:28,676
No. I'm not all right.

452
00:57:29,654 --> 00:57:33,590
Look, I think I've done some very...

453
00:57:33,791 --> 00:57:36,385
very bad things.

454
00:57:37,963 --> 00:57:41,091
Everybody does things
they regret.

455
00:57:41,633 --> 00:57:43,794
It's part of life.

456
00:57:44,002 --> 00:57:46,937
Until now you couldn't remember
parts of your past, and...

457
00:57:47,339 --> 00:57:50,433
now they're hitting you all at once.
It's a shock to the system.

458
00:57:50,843 --> 00:57:56,076
You can't undo your past.
You're going to have to confront it.

459
00:57:57,049 --> 00:58:00,849
And it frightens me to think that I
can't be there for you when you do.

460
00:58:07,993 --> 00:58:12,054
- Hey, buddy?
- I was thinking I was going insane.

461
00:58:12,264 --> 00:58:13,925
- Hey, buddy.
- What?

462
00:58:14,867 --> 00:58:17,301
Who the hell are you talking to?

463
00:58:38,056 --> 00:58:42,425
- What have you done?
- What's your relationship with Gwen?

464
00:58:42,628 --> 00:58:45,620
I know about Gwen
and the others.

465
00:58:50,269 --> 00:58:51,964
What the fuck...?

466
00:59:38,016 --> 00:59:40,143
Where are you?

467
00:59:40,352 --> 00:59:43,253
What have you
done to me? Fuck.

468
00:59:43,922 --> 00:59:46,652
What the fuck is
happening to me?

469
00:59:51,530 --> 00:59:54,328
Where are you, goddamn it?

470
00:59:54,533 --> 00:59:56,865
Poor Trevor.

471
00:59:59,972 --> 01:00:01,872
Who are you?

472
01:00:06,611 --> 01:00:09,205
Still in the dark?

473
01:00:14,953 --> 01:00:20,220
- This game is over. Do you hear me?
- Oh, I hear everything.

474
01:00:20,425 --> 01:00:23,019
And soon you will
know everything.

475
01:00:23,228 --> 01:00:26,561
Much more than you want.
I guarantee it.

476
01:00:27,632 --> 01:00:31,033
What is this?
Why are you doing this to me?

477
01:00:31,236 --> 01:00:34,865
Is it so difficult
to face your demons?

478
01:00:36,108 --> 01:00:39,771
No. None of this is real.

479
01:00:40,879 --> 01:00:44,406
- You're not real.
- Oh, but I'm afraid I am.

480
01:00:46,785 --> 01:00:49,447
You can't run from your past.

481
01:00:54,626 --> 01:00:56,526
You killed them.

482
01:00:57,195 --> 01:00:59,459
You killed Kirsty.

483
01:00:59,664 --> 01:01:01,757
You killed Gwen...

484
01:01:01,967 --> 01:01:04,299
and the others.

485
01:01:04,503 --> 01:01:06,733
You killed them...

486
01:01:06,938 --> 01:01:09,065
and now you're trying
to pin it on me.

487
01:01:09,674 --> 01:01:14,078
The killer is amongst us, yes.

488
01:01:24,524 --> 01:01:25,991
Fuck!

489
01:01:36,569 --> 01:01:39,834
God damn it!

490
01:02:05,098 --> 01:02:08,499
Where have you been, Trev?
I've been looking all over for you.

491
01:02:16,309 --> 01:02:19,210
Jesus, what are you doing?
Put that thing away.

492
01:02:20,012 --> 01:02:22,913
Tonight was supposed to be
the night, Trev, remember?

493
01:02:23,116 --> 01:02:26,449
Right, you don't remember anything.
Let me remind you about your plan.

494
01:02:26,652 --> 01:02:29,450
We kill Kirsty, make it look like
a suicide, you get all her money...

495
01:02:29,655 --> 01:02:32,021
we split it 50/50.

496
01:02:32,225 --> 01:02:33,852
But none of that's gonna
happen now, is it?

497
01:02:34,260 --> 01:02:37,457
You had to go solo with your car
accident bit. You fucked it all up.

498
01:02:37,663 --> 01:02:42,032
What were you thinking, Trev?
That I'd forget about our deal?

499
01:02:42,235 --> 01:02:44,795
- I don't know...
- What you're talking about. I know.

500
01:02:45,138 --> 01:02:49,097
Got to tell you, the amnesia routine
is starting to get a little old.

501
01:02:49,308 --> 01:02:53,540
Lange's on to you. It's a matter
of time before he's on to me.

502
01:02:55,414 --> 01:02:58,383
I don't want to spend
the rest of my life in prison.

503
01:02:59,519 --> 01:03:01,384
I'd rather spend it in hell.

504
01:03:02,755 --> 01:03:04,416
With you.

505
01:03:13,399 --> 01:03:15,333
Bret, what did you do?

506
01:03:28,848 --> 01:03:32,784
No, you're not real.
Get out of my head!

507
01:03:42,195 --> 01:03:43,856
Sage.

508
01:03:50,870 --> 01:03:51,894
Sage.

509
01:05:21,528 --> 01:05:22,995
Trevor.

510
01:05:24,464 --> 01:05:27,297
- You don't understand. I didn't...
- Save it.

511
01:05:28,835 --> 01:05:31,303
You don't need to say a thing.

512
01:05:32,205 --> 01:05:34,070
No, I say... You don't...

513
01:05:34,341 --> 01:05:36,332
You have the right
to remain in silence.

514
01:05:43,750 --> 01:05:47,584
What's going on here, Detective?
You can't believe that I did this.

515
01:05:47,788 --> 01:05:50,723
Detective, believe me, I didn't do
what you think I did, please.

516
01:05:50,924 --> 01:05:54,690
Relax, Trevor. Let's get to the
bottom of this once and for all.

517
01:05:54,895 --> 01:05:57,693
You want to tell me exactly
what happened back there...

518
01:05:57,964 --> 01:06:00,899
or should we just play
the head game a little longer?

519
01:06:05,339 --> 01:06:07,899
Okay, we'll do it your way.

520
01:06:09,276 --> 01:06:11,403
This is Lange.

521
01:06:13,013 --> 01:06:14,981
Really?

522
01:06:15,182 --> 01:06:18,174
Well, I got him
sitting right in front of me now.

523
01:06:19,019 --> 01:06:21,112
Yes.

524
01:06:21,888 --> 01:06:23,185
Yes.

525
01:06:30,464 --> 01:06:32,022
I hear you.

526
01:06:33,567 --> 01:06:34,556
Thank you.

527
01:06:35,535 --> 01:06:39,232
Well, one thing's for sure.
This ain't your lucky day.

528
01:06:40,574 --> 01:06:43,475
They found the body
this morning in the river.

529
01:06:43,677 --> 01:06:46,771
They're bringing it into the morgue
now, so you can identify it.

530
01:06:46,980 --> 01:06:49,312
Is it my wife?

531
01:06:49,616 --> 01:06:51,982
Stay put.

532
01:07:06,099 --> 01:07:09,694
You know, I had you pegged for bad
the minute I laid eyes on you.

533
01:07:13,707 --> 01:07:17,768
Now, I want you to tell me
everything you remember happening.

534
01:07:17,978 --> 01:07:21,709
Exactly the way you told Lange.
But I want you to make one...

535
01:07:22,349 --> 01:07:25,216
...minor adjustment.
- What's that?

536
01:07:26,153 --> 01:07:28,781
Don't fucking lie to me.

537
01:07:28,989 --> 01:07:32,117
I just want to see my wife.
I just want to see my wife.

538
01:07:44,471 --> 01:07:47,099
I thought I asked you
to stay put.

539
01:07:49,609 --> 01:07:52,305
Each killed with a single
gunshot wound to the head.

540
01:07:52,646 --> 01:07:56,047
Tortured, then shot.
We find the gun...

541
01:07:56,416 --> 01:07:59,351
we find the killer.
This way.

542
01:08:07,294 --> 01:08:09,854
Sick motherfucker!
Get off me!

543
01:08:10,063 --> 01:08:12,361
They're gonna fry your ass,
motherfucker!

544
01:08:12,566 --> 01:08:15,330
I'm gonna strangle
your fucking neck!

545
01:08:15,902 --> 01:08:19,201
- You've got quite the fan club.
- Please, don't.

546
01:08:19,406 --> 01:08:22,341
I didn't do it. I swear,
I didn't do it. Please!

547
01:08:27,281 --> 01:08:28,646
Here we go.

548
01:09:39,020 --> 01:09:41,250
Just about there.

549
01:10:06,747 --> 01:10:08,442
Thanks.

550
01:10:15,056 --> 01:10:18,685
What are you... what are you doing?
I thought you believed me.

551
01:10:19,193 --> 01:10:21,127
Believe?

552
01:10:21,629 --> 01:10:23,688
Here's what I believe, Trevor.

553
01:10:23,898 --> 01:10:27,129
I believe you and me
have a lot in common.

554
01:10:27,602 --> 01:10:30,503
I believe each of us
are the sum of two...

555
01:10:30,705 --> 01:10:33,640
entirely different people.

556
01:10:34,809 --> 01:10:36,436
No.

557
01:10:37,745 --> 01:10:40,111
I know who I am.

558
01:10:40,715 --> 01:10:42,876
And I'm not a killer.

559
01:10:43,084 --> 01:10:47,418
Denial to the end.
That's what I like about you, kid!

560
01:10:49,423 --> 01:10:51,948
Good and bad, Trevor.

561
01:10:52,159 --> 01:10:56,186
Honest, dishonest.
Righteous and evil.

562
01:10:56,397 --> 01:10:59,161
That's how we're all made.

563
01:10:59,367 --> 01:11:01,835
A little of both.

564
01:11:02,236 --> 01:11:07,003
It's just a question
of how much...

565
01:11:07,742 --> 01:11:09,801
of each.

566
01:11:21,422 --> 01:11:26,519
And we're made up of just
the right parts of both.

567
01:11:29,630 --> 01:11:32,394
A little heavier on the evil, huh?

568
01:11:39,707 --> 01:11:42,107
It's all good, Trev.

569
01:11:42,443 --> 01:11:44,536
It's all good!

570
01:13:47,269 --> 01:13:49,635
Kirsty?

571
01:15:05,447 --> 01:15:09,281
It seems you've reached
the end of your journey.

572
01:15:13,588 --> 01:15:17,581
I told you you couldn't run
from your past forever.

573
01:15:17,893 --> 01:15:20,794
Eventually it catches up to you.

574
01:15:21,329 --> 01:15:23,729
And you must atone.

575
01:15:25,467 --> 01:15:27,492
And now...

576
01:15:27,969 --> 01:15:31,427
it is time for you
to pay the price.

577
01:15:31,640 --> 01:15:34,302
You were willing
to pay the price, weren't you?

578
01:15:38,781 --> 01:15:42,114
- I just want to see my wife.
- In time.

579
01:15:42,518 --> 01:15:46,454
- Let me see my wife.
- I said in time!

580
01:16:16,452 --> 01:16:18,682
"All problems solved"?

581
01:16:19,121 --> 01:16:20,850
Not so simple, I'm afraid.

582
01:16:21,857 --> 01:16:25,554
I needed first to open
the door for you.

583
01:16:27,897 --> 01:16:30,457
You were an interesting study.

584
01:16:31,600 --> 01:16:35,400
Lust, greed, deception,
fertile ground...

585
01:16:35,604 --> 01:16:40,268
but rather mundane. Let us
take one final journey together.

586
01:16:40,676 --> 01:16:45,238
Let me help you remember.
Once and for all.

587
01:16:45,448 --> 01:16:47,313
What have you done?

588
01:16:47,984 --> 01:16:50,384
It's just a puzzle.
Open it up.

589
01:16:50,786 --> 01:16:53,983
I trusted you.
I trusted you, goddamn it!

590
01:16:54,190 --> 01:16:55,817
How could you do this to us?

591
01:16:56,292 --> 01:16:59,921
- You told me you loved me!
- Just open the fucking box.

592
01:17:00,196 --> 01:17:03,563
We were uninvited guests
at your little celebration.

593
01:17:04,433 --> 01:17:06,628
Is this what you want?

594
01:17:07,503 --> 01:17:09,095
Unseen by you.

595
01:17:11,140 --> 01:17:13,199
I hope it's everything
you want it to be.

596
01:17:19,181 --> 01:17:21,547
I used you, Trevor.

597
01:17:22,351 --> 01:17:24,842
You were nothing more than bait.

598
01:17:25,688 --> 01:17:29,624
To lure a far more
interesting creature.

599
01:17:36,766 --> 01:17:41,135
Kirsty. We meet again.

600
01:17:41,704 --> 01:17:46,266
- How did you find me?
- You opened the door long ago.

601
01:17:46,475 --> 01:17:50,468
And it will not be closed
until I get what I came for.

602
01:17:51,714 --> 01:17:52,840
My soul.

603
01:17:53,049 --> 01:17:55,711
No!

604
01:17:56,318 --> 01:17:59,913
You solved the puzzle.
You unleashed the power.

605
01:18:00,122 --> 01:18:03,717
There is no turning back.
I will not rest...

606
01:18:03,926 --> 01:18:09,228
until I get what I want.
And what I want is you.

607
01:18:17,640 --> 01:18:20,302
You always knew
this day was coming.

608
01:18:20,509 --> 01:18:23,103
Felt it deep within your soul.

609
01:18:23,712 --> 01:18:25,441
Wait!

610
01:18:25,848 --> 01:18:27,679
Wait.

611
01:18:34,857 --> 01:18:36,984
What if I make you a deal?

612
01:18:37,493 --> 01:18:38,960
Interesting.

613
01:18:39,395 --> 01:18:43,161
I will bring you five souls
in exchange for mine.

614
01:18:43,866 --> 01:18:46,801
You would bring them
to me yourself?

615
01:18:47,736 --> 01:18:49,931
You'll get your five.

616
01:18:50,139 --> 01:18:52,607
I was impressed
with her handiwork.

617
01:18:54,076 --> 01:18:58,604
Three of your favorite companions
most supple and delicious.

618
01:19:00,282 --> 01:19:04,184
And the man with whom
you once conspired to kill Kirsty.

619
01:19:05,354 --> 01:19:07,845
They are all with me now.

620
01:19:08,524 --> 01:19:10,857
The balance is only four souls...

621
01:19:11,061 --> 01:19:15,395
and that, as you now know,
was not our contract.

622
01:19:16,566 --> 01:19:20,468
You have seen many things
that you'll wish you had not.

623
01:19:21,171 --> 01:19:22,798
All those women...

624
01:19:23,373 --> 01:19:26,399
in our home, in my bed.

625
01:19:27,110 --> 01:19:30,307
Many nightmares from which
you will never awake.

626
01:19:30,514 --> 01:19:33,881
- Oh, Kirsty, come on...
- Don't you lie to me! Don't!

627
01:19:34,084 --> 01:19:37,417
We can make it work and put the
pieces back together. Believe me.

628
01:19:37,621 --> 01:19:38,713
I am done believing!

629
01:19:38,955 --> 01:19:40,980
I trusted you!

630
01:19:41,191 --> 01:19:43,682
I can't believe this shit is
happening. I have a fucking deal.

631
01:19:49,032 --> 01:19:51,728
No, you had a deal.

632
01:19:53,003 --> 01:19:54,834
But I made a better offer.

633
01:19:57,874 --> 01:20:00,069
And guess what?

634
01:20:02,312 --> 01:20:04,712
- He took it.
- Welcome...

635
01:20:05,248 --> 01:20:09,582
to the worst nightmare of all.

636
01:20:11,488 --> 01:20:12,716
Reality.

637
01:21:14,618 --> 01:21:16,483
Fuck.

638
01:21:19,789 --> 01:21:21,950
I'm the fifth soul.

639
01:21:29,933 --> 01:21:32,424
Yeah, that's him.

640
01:21:35,305 --> 01:21:37,296
Okay, people, that's it.

641
01:21:42,746 --> 01:21:44,611
He just shot himself.

642
01:21:44,814 --> 01:21:48,477
Next thing I knew, we were in
the water, I couldn't see anything.

643
01:21:52,155 --> 01:21:55,522
- I lost him.
- You did what you could.

644
01:21:56,126 --> 01:21:59,721
- I'm sorry.
- It just doesn't make any sense.

645
01:22:00,397 --> 01:22:02,957
That he would be
capable of murder.

646
01:22:03,166 --> 01:22:06,499
We found the gun in your car.
It appears to be the same.

647
01:22:06,703 --> 01:22:09,831
If it matches, I think we may
have found our killer.

648
01:22:14,311 --> 01:22:16,370
Wait a minute, guys,
before you zip him up.

649
01:22:20,350 --> 01:22:21,977
Not your lucky day, was it?

650
01:22:22,485 --> 01:22:24,817
Check the oral cavity
for blockages?

651
01:22:26,089 --> 01:22:28,284
What have we got here?

652
01:22:39,002 --> 01:22:41,732
And we have a winner.

653
01:22:46,510 --> 01:22:48,808
Okay, zip it up.
We'll finish at the morgue.

654
01:22:49,013 --> 01:22:50,947
Wait, wait.

655
01:22:54,819 --> 01:22:58,277
Sorry I had to leave you like that
for a minute, Trev. I'm back.

656
01:23:00,257 --> 01:23:02,088
Can you hear me, Trevor?

657
01:23:02,293 --> 01:23:05,922
Jesus, Allison. What possesses
you to talk to cadavers?

658
01:23:06,330 --> 01:23:08,093
What if there's no afterlife?

659
01:23:08,299 --> 01:23:11,996
Wouldn't you want someone to talk
to you like a normal human being?

660
01:23:19,176 --> 01:23:22,475
You're creeping me out.
And I'm the coroner.

661
01:23:40,898 --> 01:23:43,992
I've arranged a ride home for you,
so I guess you're free to go.

662
01:23:45,102 --> 01:23:48,094
Thank you, Detective.
For everything.

663
01:23:49,740 --> 01:23:51,332
Ah, one more thing.

664
01:23:54,612 --> 01:23:57,012
I wonder if you know
anything about this.

665
01:23:57,248 --> 01:23:59,580
We found it in the car.

666
01:24:07,358 --> 01:24:10,850
Yeah.
It was my anniversary gift.

667
01:24:13,397 --> 01:24:16,457
You know, I was gonna
turn it in as evidence.

668
01:24:18,102 --> 01:24:21,868
But I'll tell you what.
Why don't you take it home?

669
01:24:23,908 --> 01:24:26,877
Something to remember him by.

670
01:24:33,317 --> 01:24:36,309
Of course. Thank you.
