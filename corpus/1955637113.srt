1
00:00:43,150 --> 00:00:48,529
<i>At what point shall we expect
the approach of danger?</i>

2
00:00:48,530 --> 00:00:51,323
<i>By what means
shall we fortify against it?</i>

3
00:01:25,233 --> 00:01:28,111
<i>You are out.</i>

4
00:03:30,525 --> 00:03:32,818
<i>You know what I like?</i>

5
00:03:32,819 --> 00:03:36,406
<i>The ancient Greeks.
Egyptians and Romans.</i>

6
00:03:38,241 --> 00:03:41,036
<i>Alexander the Great'
Julius Caesar, Cleopatra,</i>

7
00:03:42,287 --> 00:03:46,165
<i>the Trojan Horse,
gladiators, chariot races,</i>

8
00:03:46,166 --> 00:03:48,792
<i>spectacular murders and suicides,</i>

9
00:03:48,793 --> 00:03:50,586
<i>the eruption of Vesuvius,</i>

10
00:03:50,587 --> 00:03:55,424
<i>temples, amphitheaters, arenas,
mosaics' frescoes' baths.</i>

11
00:03:55,425 --> 00:03:58,636
<i>I remember those things
as if I learned them yesterday.</i>

12
00:03:59,179 --> 00:04:00,597
<i>But then the Middles Ages...</i>

13
00:04:05,393 --> 00:04:07,978
-And...
-Is this over the summer?

14
00:04:07,979 --> 00:04:10,105
It was over the...

15
00:04:10,106 --> 00:04:12,608
It was over the, like...
into the beginning of August.

16
00:04:12,609 --> 00:04:15,235
So you ditched school
for the first couple of weeks?

17
00:04:15,236 --> 00:04:17,571
I did do that, yeah. I did.

18
00:04:17,572 --> 00:04:20,366
But I told my parents
that what I was doing was...

19
00:04:20,367 --> 00:04:22,786
<i>But then the Middle Ages?
Fuck that.</i>

20
00:04:23,495 --> 00:04:25,372
<i>A blip of a disgusting mess.</i>

21
00:04:26,206 --> 00:04:27,956
<i>The Renaissance,
the beginning of the end,</i>

22
00:04:27,957 --> 00:04:30,877
<i>the modern age, just look at us.</i>

23
00:04:31,753 --> 00:04:33,922
<i>And American history,
what is that?</i>

24
00:04:34,798 --> 00:04:36,256
<i>I remember studying
in high school</i>

25
00:04:36,257 --> 00:04:38,134
<i>and praying for the British to win.</i>

26
00:04:38,885 --> 00:04:42,012
<i>Praying for the Native Americans
to slaughter the Pilgrims'</i>

27
00:04:42,013 --> 00:04:45,140
<i>for the whole kit and caboodle
to go up in smoke'</i>

28
00:04:45,141 --> 00:04:46,851
<i>both sides in the Civil War.</i>

29
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:52,231
<i>And then both World Wars
and, and Korea and Vietnam</i>

30
00:04:52,232 --> 00:04:54,775
<i>and Kuwait, Iraq, Afghanistan.</i>

31
00:04:54,776 --> 00:04:57,529
<i>Who needs that?
They don't. They don't care.</i>

32
00:04:58,113 --> 00:04:59,906
<i>Neither do I, neither do you.</i>

33
00:05:01,741 --> 00:05:02,951
<i>I'm not going.</i>

34
00:05:04,244 --> 00:05:05,245
<i>I'm not going.</i>

35
00:05:06,996 --> 00:05:08,373
<i>I'm not going.</i>

36
00:05:15,797 --> 00:05:16,839
I'm not going.

37
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:20,008
Paul, it takes three months
to get a reservation to this place.

38
00:05:20,009 --> 00:05:22,594
And Stan got it overnight.
Congratulations.

39
00:05:22,595 --> 00:05:25,514
Well, so, you don't want them here,
you refuse to go to their place.

40
00:05:25,515 --> 00:05:28,100
-You don't want to go anywhere.
-I'd rather stay home with you.

41
00:05:28,101 --> 00:05:30,561
That restaurant's a joke.
Anyway, it's ridiculous.

42
00:05:30,562 --> 00:05:34,482
It sounds super-exclusive
and sexy and food art.

43
00:05:35,108 --> 00:05:36,275
Like going to France.

44
00:05:36,276 --> 00:05:38,193
During the German occupation, maybe.

45
00:05:38,194 --> 00:05:40,696
Look, I'm sure
we're gonna get a great table...

46
00:05:40,697 --> 00:05:43,323
-Great table at a great restaurant...
-For God's sake.

47
00:05:43,324 --> 00:05:45,242
-Great dinner in great company...
-You can't do this.

48
00:05:45,243 --> 00:05:46,493
It comes at great expense.

49
00:05:46,494 --> 00:05:47,953
Stan'll pay. I need help.

50
00:05:47,954 --> 00:05:50,539
For that kind of expense,
you know, you pay a bigger price

51
00:05:50,540 --> 00:05:51,958
for not picking up the check.

52
00:05:55,587 --> 00:05:56,963
Okay.

53
00:05:57,589 --> 00:05:58,714
-In there.
-I know how.

54
00:05:58,715 --> 00:05:59,966
That goes in there.

55
00:06:00,884 --> 00:06:02,176
-It's just...
-Here.

56
00:06:02,177 --> 00:06:03,427
Okay.

57
00:06:03,428 --> 00:06:04,803
Thank you.

58
00:06:04,804 --> 00:06:06,723
-How are you feeling?
-Great.

59
00:06:07,724 --> 00:06:10,268
-You?
-Punished.

60
00:06:16,399 --> 00:06:18,693
Just don't want to be
with these people.

61
00:06:19,944 --> 00:06:21,862
-What's so funny?
-It's you.

62
00:06:21,863 --> 00:06:23,906
You. You.

63
00:06:23,907 --> 00:06:25,491
This routine
we have to go through

64
00:06:25,492 --> 00:06:26,534
every time we wanna
leave the house.

65
00:06:27,952 --> 00:06:29,203
"These people."

66
00:06:29,204 --> 00:06:33,833
You're right. These leeches,
these maggots, these apes.

67
00:06:34,292 --> 00:06:35,293
Let's cancel.

68
00:06:36,127 --> 00:06:39,339
I want you think about tonight
as a date with me.

69
00:06:39,839 --> 00:06:41,256
The two of us out on the town.

70
00:06:41,257 --> 00:06:42,716
We're gonna ditch them
at some point,

71
00:06:42,717 --> 00:06:44,218
and we'll go have a nightcap
somewhere.

72
00:06:44,219 --> 00:06:45,428
It will be fun.

73
00:06:47,263 --> 00:06:48,932
You know Michael has a girl over.

74
00:06:50,725 --> 00:06:51,851
Is that a bad thing?

75
00:06:52,602 --> 00:06:54,478
-She looks 25.
-She's 20

76
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:55,854
and she's very nice.

77
00:06:55,855 --> 00:06:57,981
Jesus, he moves fast.
What is she, a college student?

78
00:06:57,982 --> 00:06:59,733
A barista.

79
00:06:59,734 --> 00:07:01,527
-So he's drinking coffee now.
-Not drinking coffee.

80
00:07:01,528 --> 00:07:05,365
He's drinking caramel, salted,
hot chocolate with whipped cream.

81
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:08,283
What? What's bothering you?

82
00:07:08,284 --> 00:07:10,328
-He tells you too much.
-No, he doesn't.

83
00:07:11,162 --> 00:07:12,996
-He just tells me everything.
-Not everything.

84
00:07:12,997 --> 00:07:15,291
Look, it's too much.
You treat him like a daughter.

85
00:07:15,583 --> 00:07:18,043
Come on, let's go.
Get ready. I don't want to be late.

86
00:07:18,044 --> 00:07:19,836
No, I thought you didn't want to go.

87
00:07:19,837 --> 00:07:22,256
If we're late, it's just
another victory for the apes.

88
00:07:22,257 --> 00:07:24,675
Okay, you know we're gonna be
too early now.

89
00:07:24,676 --> 00:07:26,093
We can get a drink in the bar.

90
00:07:26,094 --> 00:07:28,805
It's, you know,
they have like a lounge thing.

91
00:07:29,764 --> 00:07:31,432
At least, you know, online.

92
00:07:33,351 --> 00:07:34,435
Love you.

93
00:07:35,186 --> 00:07:36,187
Love you, too.

94
00:07:36,938 --> 00:07:38,356
I mean, I really do.

95
00:07:39,315 --> 00:07:41,442
It's pretty much unbearable.

96
00:07:49,367 --> 00:07:50,451
No.

97
00:07:52,287 --> 00:07:53,955
I have the spreadsheet, yes.

98
00:07:58,001 --> 00:07:59,961
I know what he said.
I was there.

99
00:08:10,179 --> 00:08:12,140
-Thank you.
-Congressman.

100
00:08:16,227 --> 00:08:18,396
What?

101
00:08:24,277 --> 00:08:25,361
No.

102
00:09:19,332 --> 00:09:22,085
<i>-Is this really happening?
-It was so fucking tense.</i>

103
00:09:22,835 --> 00:09:26,046
Dad.

104
00:09:26,047 --> 00:09:27,631
-Dad?
-Hey. What's going on?

105
00:09:27,632 --> 00:09:28,840
What are you doing with my phone?

106
00:09:28,841 --> 00:09:31,594
I just... nothing.
Just looking for you.

107
00:09:32,011 --> 00:09:34,012
-Why?
-You know...

108
00:09:34,013 --> 00:09:35,347
-What's going on?
-I don't know. Just looking for you.

109
00:09:35,348 --> 00:09:37,183
Just... Where's the girl?

110
00:09:37,558 --> 00:09:38,685
The girl has a name, Dad.

111
00:09:39,018 --> 00:09:41,561
Okay, where's, Jennifer, Michelle...

112
00:09:41,562 --> 00:09:42,813
-Zoe...
-Anna.

113
00:09:42,814 --> 00:09:43,856
Anna.

114
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:47,025
Yeah, Anna. It's not like that.
We're just friends.

115
00:09:47,026 --> 00:09:48,944
Well, tell Anna to come up.
We don't bite.

116
00:09:48,945 --> 00:09:50,070
Do you know
where the bike pump is?

117
00:09:50,071 --> 00:09:51,488
-It's...
-It's not in the garage.

118
00:09:51,489 --> 00:09:53,281
It's... I don't know where...

119
00:09:53,282 --> 00:09:55,283
Have you tried the bushes
in the backyard?

120
00:09:55,284 --> 00:09:56,536
Why would they be in the bushes?

121
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,710
-You okay, Dad?
-Sure. Yeah.

122
00:10:04,711 --> 00:10:08,672
We have to go out to dinner,
with the hominids.

123
00:10:08,673 --> 00:10:10,382
-Who's that?
-Great apes.

124
00:10:10,383 --> 00:10:12,426
They don't teach you anything
at school these days?

125
00:10:12,427 --> 00:10:14,219
See? You do bite.

126
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:16,263
-Hey, I found your...
-Hello...

127
00:10:16,264 --> 00:10:17,765
-pump.
-Anna.

128
00:10:18,099 --> 00:10:21,185
-We'll be out of your way real soon.
-Okay.

129
00:10:21,436 --> 00:10:24,188
-Are you a smoker, Anna?
-What? No.

130
00:10:24,522 --> 00:10:26,858
Good for you. That's...
Keep away from cigarettes.

131
00:10:27,817 --> 00:10:31,153
If you kids are hungry,
there's, plenty of food in the fridge.

132
00:10:31,154 --> 00:10:33,363
Not that you're a kid,
you know.

133
00:10:33,364 --> 00:10:35,116
You're a young person.

134
00:10:35,324 --> 00:10:37,743
I mean, we have a coffee machine,

135
00:10:37,744 --> 00:10:39,703
-if you want a coffee.
-Cool.

136
00:10:39,704 --> 00:10:41,956
Understand you're
in the hospitality business.

137
00:10:42,206 --> 00:10:45,251
-Yeah.
-That's it.

138
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:28,085
Here it is. For four?

139
00:11:28,419 --> 00:11:30,713
-Mr. and Mrs. Lohman have not arrived.
-Yes, we have.

140
00:11:31,506 --> 00:11:32,714
You want to see our driving license?

141
00:11:32,715 --> 00:11:34,049
-No, I mean...
-I know what you meant.

142
00:11:34,050 --> 00:11:36,760
-I'm his brother.
-Of course. I apologize.

143
00:11:36,761 --> 00:11:39,721
I accept your apology.
But he wouldn't

144
00:11:39,722 --> 00:11:41,139
if it was the other way around.

145
00:11:41,140 --> 00:11:42,558
Of course. Right this way.

146
00:11:42,725 --> 00:11:44,643
Mr. and Mrs. Lohman, welcome.

147
00:11:44,644 --> 00:11:46,353
So glad you could join us this evening.

148
00:11:46,354 --> 00:11:48,146
Mrs. Lohman, can we take
your coat, please?

149
00:11:48,147 --> 00:11:50,650
Hello.

150
00:12:03,830 --> 00:12:04,830
-Watch your step.
-Stay where you are, guys.

151
00:12:04,831 --> 00:12:06,082
Thank you.

152
00:12:06,374 --> 00:12:07,916
That's it for tonight.

153
00:12:07,917 --> 00:12:11,295
Good job. Good job, everybody.
Thank you.

154
00:12:11,629 --> 00:12:13,296
All right, go home.
I'll see you tomorrow.

155
00:12:13,297 --> 00:12:14,881
-No, I'm coming in.
-There's really no need.

156
00:12:14,882 --> 00:12:17,092
-Give us a call in...
-I'm not leaving you alone tonight.

157
00:12:17,093 --> 00:12:18,511
Not with everything that's going on.

158
00:12:19,345 --> 00:12:22,682
-I mean, seriously, boss.
-Okay.

159
00:12:23,808 --> 00:12:25,559
But I don't want to be disturbed
during dinner.

160
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:26,394
That's fine.

161
00:12:26,978 --> 00:12:28,979
Wait, hold on, Congressman.

162
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:31,231
It's a DC number.

163
00:12:31,232 --> 00:12:33,316
-Who is it?
-I think... Yes, it's the Speaker.

164
00:12:33,317 --> 00:12:35,570
Great, great, great, great.
Thank you. Great.

165
00:12:38,364 --> 00:12:40,699
Mr. Speaker, before you say anything,
I want you to know

166
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:43,410
I'm working on Parity votes.
And we are close.

167
00:12:43,411 --> 00:12:47,206
Here we have a garden of young
vegetables for you while you wait.

168
00:12:48,124 --> 00:12:51,918
Chantenay carrots,
breakfast radishes,

169
00:12:51,919 --> 00:12:53,837
wild fennel
and a Tokyo turnip.

170
00:12:53,838 --> 00:12:56,590
Simply served with olive oil
from the Peloponnese,

171
00:12:56,591 --> 00:12:59,051
-infused with rosemary from Oregon.
-Tarragon?

172
00:13:00,303 --> 00:13:03,305
Oregon the state.
Oregonian rosemary.

173
00:13:03,306 --> 00:13:04,556
-Yes.
-I know it's a state.

174
00:13:04,557 --> 00:13:07,435
I, I thought they grew oregano
in Oregon.

175
00:13:07,810 --> 00:13:11,062
-Funny.
-Yeah. Timing.

176
00:13:11,063 --> 00:13:12,689
Also, there is a light dusting...

177
00:13:12,690 --> 00:13:15,984
I mean, we don't have "time"
for rosemary so take it away.

178
00:13:17,737 --> 00:13:19,696
-My God.
-There is a light dusting

179
00:13:19,697 --> 00:13:21,865
-of Himalayan pink salt.
-That is delicious.

180
00:13:21,866 --> 00:13:26,328
Can you taste the wars and plagues
and the fire bombings,

181
00:13:26,329 --> 00:13:31,291
lightly doused with a drizzle
of famine and. polished off

182
00:13:31,292 --> 00:13:32,918
-with some volcanic eruption.
-He's showing off now.

183
00:13:32,919 --> 00:13:34,462
He used to teach.

184
00:13:35,421 --> 00:13:38,132
Here's the wine menu
for your selection.

185
00:13:39,175 --> 00:13:43,219
No. No, the campaign
is not slowing me down at all.

186
00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:44,931
In fact, I'm more determined
than ever.

187
00:13:45,932 --> 00:13:48,559
Yeah, I just need tonight
to tally everything up.

188
00:13:53,856 --> 00:13:56,233
Yeah.

189
00:13:56,484 --> 00:13:57,817
Come on, Stan, we have to go.

190
00:13:57,818 --> 00:13:59,986
Yeah, sorry. Sir, sir?
I'm sorry, got to go.

191
00:13:59,987 --> 00:14:02,405
Got to go. Yeah.
I'll have those votes by the morning.

192
00:14:02,406 --> 00:14:05,034
Okay, and Kate,
Kate sends her best,

193
00:14:05,910 --> 00:14:06,953
her love...

194
00:14:07,995 --> 00:14:09,829
to you and Sabina.
Thanks.

195
00:14:09,830 --> 00:14:10,957
Talk to you tomorrow.
Bye.

196
00:14:13,793 --> 00:14:15,503
-Jesus Christ.
-What?

197
00:14:16,337 --> 00:14:19,714
Do you know how much this bottle
of pink shit we just ordered costs?

198
00:14:19,715 --> 00:14:21,174
Don't worry about it.
I'm sure Stan won't mind.

199
00:14:21,175 --> 00:14:23,426
That's immoral.
That's an act of war.

200
00:14:23,427 --> 00:14:24,803
-That's, that's...
-It's not.

201
00:14:24,804 --> 00:14:26,763
-Come on.
-It's champagne.

202
00:14:26,764 --> 00:14:29,391
-It's a fancy drink.
-I'm not drinking something that expensive.

203
00:14:29,392 --> 00:14:31,059
-Okay, you don't have to drink it.
-It's fucking wrong.

204
00:14:31,060 --> 00:14:32,853
Here we go.

205
00:14:33,187 --> 00:14:35,606
No, no, you can go.
You can go, thank you.

206
00:14:36,107 --> 00:14:37,899
Hello, Congressman.
Good to see you again.

207
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:39,859
-Welcome back.
-Thank you so much. Thank you, thank you.

208
00:14:39,860 --> 00:14:42,445
-I don't think you were here last time.
-I was in France.

209
00:14:42,446 --> 00:14:43,823
Yeah, yeah.

210
00:14:54,125 --> 00:14:57,503
-Hi.
-I'm so sorry that we're late.

211
00:14:57,712 --> 00:14:59,295
Paul insisted. We were early.

212
00:14:59,296 --> 00:15:02,048
-Really.
-Actually, I insisted. We were on time.

213
00:15:02,049 --> 00:15:03,926
Aw, Paul.

214
00:15:10,433 --> 00:15:11,475
It's been a hell of a day.

215
00:15:11,642 --> 00:15:13,143
-Nice to see you.
-Here, too.

216
00:15:13,144 --> 00:15:14,728
Can we just go out and get pizza?

217
00:15:14,729 --> 00:15:16,688
-Why? What's wrong with this place?
-Nothing.

218
00:15:16,689 --> 00:15:17,690
-Everything.
-Nothing.

219
00:15:24,363 --> 00:15:25,990
-You look good, Paul.
-Thanks.

220
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:27,991
Not as good as my brother,

221
00:15:27,992 --> 00:15:31,369
but then I don't spend quite as
much time in makeup as he does.

222
00:15:31,370 --> 00:15:33,329
Why don't you just take
the compliment and move on?

223
00:15:33,330 --> 00:15:35,248
Sorry.
You look good, too, Kate.

224
00:15:35,249 --> 00:15:36,208
Thank you.

225
00:15:38,002 --> 00:15:42,172
And you are your usual gorgeous self,
Claire, it goes without saying.

226
00:15:42,173 --> 00:15:43,007
Thanks.

227
00:15:47,094 --> 00:15:49,138
Very nice to see you.
Please, please.

228
00:15:53,851 --> 00:15:55,394
Sometimes it's very hard
to avoid people.

229
00:15:59,732 --> 00:16:02,859
Claire, Claire. Look at you.

230
00:16:02,860 --> 00:16:04,027
-Hello.
-You look great.

231
00:16:04,028 --> 00:16:05,987
It's been too long.
It's fabulous.

232
00:16:05,988 --> 00:16:07,072
-Thank you.
-Brother.

233
00:16:07,073 --> 00:16:08,239
Worried about you there, Stan,

234
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:09,783
if you were gonna make it
across the room.

235
00:16:09,784 --> 00:16:12,827
I got my posse here with me.

236
00:16:12,828 --> 00:16:15,039
Highly trained bodyguards.

237
00:16:16,499 --> 00:16:18,542
You can stop smiling now, Stan,
it's just us.

238
00:16:20,586 --> 00:16:21,754
Give it a rest, will you, Paul.

239
00:16:22,588 --> 00:16:23,756
This is long overdue.

240
00:16:24,590 --> 00:16:25,716
What were you talking about?

241
00:16:26,133 --> 00:16:27,467
-We...
-We were just...

242
00:16:27,468 --> 00:16:32,014
We were just enjoying one of those
awkward pauses, as they say.

243
00:16:32,681 --> 00:16:34,474
Not talking about anything.

244
00:16:34,475 --> 00:16:38,437
Not talking about anything.
Well, we're gonna talk tonight.

245
00:16:40,022 --> 00:16:41,314
We're gonna put it all on the table...

246
00:16:45,152 --> 00:16:47,153
Something wrong?

247
00:16:47,154 --> 00:16:48,530
This is about...

248
00:16:48,531 --> 00:16:50,573
-Stan, would you... stop.
-Are you okay?

249
00:16:50,574 --> 00:16:51,449
No, no, don't.

250
00:16:51,450 --> 00:16:53,368
-He doesn't like the table.
-See if there's a better table.

251
00:16:53,369 --> 00:16:56,204
No, it's really, it's all right.
We're fine here.

252
00:16:56,205 --> 00:16:59,290
-We just got settled.
-You know, actually, actually the other room...

253
00:16:59,291 --> 00:17:01,751
-I think I'll see...
-But this room is private enough.

254
00:17:01,752 --> 00:17:03,002
-There's no need.
-Private as a fish tank.

255
00:17:03,003 --> 00:17:05,839
There's another room over there.
Just a second. Let me check it out.

256
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:07,758
-I actually agree.
-I'm not moving.

257
00:17:09,343 --> 00:17:10,218
I'm not.

258
00:17:21,730 --> 00:17:24,149
Thank you, Antonio.
You're a real jewel.

259
00:17:24,150 --> 00:17:25,900
Thank you very much,
and for the table, too.

260
00:17:25,901 --> 00:17:26,819
It's my pleasure.

261
00:17:28,696 --> 00:17:30,322
All right, a toast.

262
00:17:31,574 --> 00:17:34,701
To our beautiful wives.

263
00:17:34,702 --> 00:17:36,078
How about to the children?

264
00:17:36,787 --> 00:17:37,745
To health.

265
00:17:37,746 --> 00:17:39,957
To getting through this dinner
in one piece.

266
00:17:43,294 --> 00:17:45,253
Cheers.

267
00:17:48,215 --> 00:17:51,092
For the gentlemen, we have a potage
of butternut squash,

268
00:17:51,093 --> 00:17:54,012
that's with some candied
seasoned acorns,

269
00:17:54,013 --> 00:17:55,805
two shoots roasted garlic

270
00:17:55,806 --> 00:17:58,474
and a pecorino sardo tuile.

271
00:17:58,475 --> 00:18:00,102
Yeah, it's quite delicious.

272
00:18:00,811 --> 00:18:04,522
The ladies are having
our young winter roots.

273
00:18:04,523 --> 00:18:09,277
Those are chioggia beets,
thumbelina carrots and purple radish,

274
00:18:09,278 --> 00:18:11,362
that's served with a goat cheese
and smoked herring vinaigrette.

275
00:18:11,363 --> 00:18:15,700
There's also a few charred leeks,
radicchio, blood orange,

276
00:18:15,701 --> 00:18:20,039
and it's sprinkled
with a burnt pumpernickel soil on it.

277
00:18:24,668 --> 00:18:26,378
-That's the one.
-That's what you ordered?

278
00:18:27,171 --> 00:18:28,088
Really, it's beautiful.

279
00:18:28,964 --> 00:18:31,425
Please feel free to start in
on those appetizers.

280
00:18:32,384 --> 00:18:33,551
This is gorgeous.

281
00:18:33,552 --> 00:18:36,429
These winter roots were grown
right here in our garden.

282
00:18:39,183 --> 00:18:40,683
Terribly sorry.

283
00:18:40,684 --> 00:18:43,937
The cork doesn't seem to want to be
cooperating with me on this one,

284
00:18:43,938 --> 00:18:46,773
so let me run to the back
and get another bottle.

285
00:18:46,774 --> 00:18:48,943
-My apologies.
-No, no, that's fine.

286
00:18:50,110 --> 00:18:52,445
Always good for the nurse
to draw your blood,

287
00:18:52,446 --> 00:18:53,989
not the specialist, right, Stan?

288
00:18:55,157 --> 00:18:56,282
I don't know what you mean.

289
00:18:56,283 --> 00:18:58,076
I felt bad for him.
He was very embarrassed.

290
00:18:58,077 --> 00:18:59,994
Shouldn't be waiting on us.
That's what the waitresses are for.

291
00:18:59,995 --> 00:19:00,954
Well, he knows me.

292
00:19:00,955 --> 00:19:02,247
-We're friends.
-So what?

293
00:19:02,248 --> 00:19:03,749
We're just people, eating food.

294
00:19:04,333 --> 00:19:05,458
Eating very good food.

295
00:19:05,459 --> 00:19:07,294
It is delicious, isn't it?

296
00:19:10,339 --> 00:19:11,423
Excuse me.

297
00:19:12,424 --> 00:19:14,301
Just a second.
I'll be right back.

298
00:19:15,469 --> 00:19:16,345
You okay?

299
00:19:22,017 --> 00:19:23,644
Okay, how's it looking?

300
00:19:24,186 --> 00:19:26,104
We're 15 shy
and you need to flip them.

301
00:19:26,105 --> 00:19:28,398
Grant's switched,
Murphy's back to wavering.

302
00:19:28,399 --> 00:19:29,649
So that was a good call.

303
00:19:29,650 --> 00:19:30,942
-Great. Great.
-The insurance lobbyists

304
00:19:30,943 --> 00:19:33,069
are fighting on your Parity language
versus ACA.

305
00:19:33,070 --> 00:19:34,821
-Yeah, of course. I expected.
-And we're here.

306
00:19:34,822 --> 00:19:36,115
Why are we here?

307
00:19:39,410 --> 00:19:41,829
Okay. Just, just dial.

308
00:19:42,788 --> 00:19:44,873
You're not yourself,
but what's up with Katelyn?

309
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:47,959
Well, you've met my brother.

310
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:49,210
Okay, yeah, that's the thing.

311
00:19:49,211 --> 00:19:50,920
You leave a fund-raiser in the middle

312
00:19:50,921 --> 00:19:52,380
on the night you should be going to DC

313
00:19:52,381 --> 00:19:54,133
to invite your
psycho brother to dinner?

314
00:19:54,758 --> 00:19:55,967
All the time that I've known you,

315
00:19:55,968 --> 00:19:58,177
you've never canceled anything
without consulting me.

316
00:19:58,178 --> 00:20:00,389
-What is going on?
-It's a family matter. It's private.

317
00:20:01,473 --> 00:20:02,849
That's all you need to know.

318
00:20:02,850 --> 00:20:05,018
Are you fucking kidding me?
You are running for governor.

319
00:20:05,019 --> 00:20:06,811
Your bill is going down in flames.

320
00:20:06,812 --> 00:20:08,187
-Nothing is private.
-This is private

321
00:20:08,188 --> 00:20:10,691
and it will stay private.
For now.

322
00:20:12,484 --> 00:20:15,028
After tonight, it...
it'll all be over.

323
00:20:15,029 --> 00:20:18,324
You are freaking me out.
Tell me what is going on.

324
00:20:18,615 --> 00:20:19,782
I'd take a bullet for you,
you know that.

325
00:20:19,783 --> 00:20:22,161
Don't take a bullet for me, ever.

326
00:20:22,536 --> 00:20:25,039
Don't ever... Don't even talk like
that. I don't know why you just...

327
00:20:26,623 --> 00:20:28,125
This is my bullet.

328
00:20:30,210 --> 00:20:31,086
Dial.

329
00:20:32,171 --> 00:20:33,464
Please just dial.

330
00:20:33,630 --> 00:20:35,256
-Thank you very much.
-You're welcome.

331
00:20:35,257 --> 00:20:37,633
-Can you just put all this on my tab?
-You got it.

332
00:20:37,634 --> 00:20:39,136
-Stan Lohman.
-I know.

333
00:20:39,345 --> 00:20:41,180
-How are you doing tonight?
-Hey. Very well. Thank you.

334
00:20:41,930 --> 00:20:42,930
Can I get you anything else?

335
00:20:42,931 --> 00:20:44,641
Look, can someone just call
a cab or something.

336
00:20:45,184 --> 00:20:47,936
God. I mean, I don't have enough
for all the way home.

337
00:20:48,395 --> 00:20:50,104
What about you, Beau?

338
00:20:50,105 --> 00:20:50,981
I got three dollars.

339
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:53,025
Wait, don't you have
your mom's credit card?

340
00:20:53,609 --> 00:20:56,737
No. I mean,
it maxed out last month so...

341
00:20:57,529 --> 00:20:59,280
-And the month before.
-It was for emergency but...

342
00:20:59,281 --> 00:21:00,782
-And the month before...
-I mean, listen,

343
00:21:00,783 --> 00:21:03,077
I mean, the cabbies,
they want cash from kids, anyway.

344
00:21:04,828 --> 00:21:07,998
-Yo, what about your dad's driver?
-Yeah, no, he's out of town.

345
00:21:08,916 --> 00:21:11,459
Anyway, Dad doesn't want us kids
being chauffeured around anyway.

346
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:13,753
-Doesn't look good.
-He's a man of the people.

347
00:21:13,754 --> 00:21:14,754
That's why,

348
00:21:14,755 --> 00:21:16,840
that's why Uncle Stanley
and Aunt Barb adopted you?

349
00:21:17,633 --> 00:21:19,885
-For the people?
-Okay, look, that's not funny.

350
00:21:21,011 --> 00:21:24,139
I'm sorry, Jesus.
I'm just kidding.

351
00:21:24,807 --> 00:21:26,140
I mean, everybody knows

352
00:21:26,141 --> 00:21:28,226
your dad has the African-American
vote in the bag, anyway.

353
00:21:28,227 --> 00:21:29,310
It's still not funny.

354
00:21:29,311 --> 00:21:30,603
-Stop messing with him, Michael.
-What the fuck.

355
00:21:30,604 --> 00:21:33,732
-Seriously.
-Jeez, I take it back, okay?

356
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:35,776
God, you guys.

357
00:21:36,693 --> 00:21:38,278
Come on, Beau, lighten up.

358
00:21:44,034 --> 00:21:48,080
Yo, that's pretty funny?
Telling him to lighten up.

359
00:21:48,455 --> 00:21:50,289
-Get it?
-You're an idiot.

360
00:21:50,290 --> 00:21:54,294
Jesus, I'm just drunk, okay?
Listen, I love you, cousin.

361
00:21:55,254 --> 00:21:56,380
That's what's most important.

362
00:21:56,922 --> 00:21:58,924
Even if you can't handle your beer.

363
00:21:59,758 --> 00:22:01,717
That beer was bad.

364
00:22:01,718 --> 00:22:03,345
How can anybody fucking
live in this town?

365
00:22:04,596 --> 00:22:06,682
-It's a shithole.
-Everything sucks tonight.

366
00:22:08,767 --> 00:22:10,435
It's just a small health club
but, you know,

367
00:22:10,436 --> 00:22:13,146
I mind my own business.
It's really nice there.

368
00:22:13,147 --> 00:22:15,565
Yeah, I just don't really like
how the club,

369
00:22:15,566 --> 00:22:17,567
they work you hard
and how the instructor...

370
00:22:17,568 --> 00:22:18,651
How is it looking?

371
00:22:18,652 --> 00:22:23,197
We'll get there.
We'll get there. Yeah.

372
00:22:23,198 --> 00:22:25,116
-I'm so sorry to interrupt.
-Yeah.

373
00:22:25,117 --> 00:22:26,909
-This was in hallway.
-What is it?

374
00:22:26,910 --> 00:22:28,244
-It's you, no?
-God, it is mine.

375
00:22:28,245 --> 00:22:29,120
It's your pin.

376
00:22:29,121 --> 00:22:31,539
-Here, let me.
-Where did you find it?

377
00:22:31,540 --> 00:22:32,874
Just there the foyer.

378
00:22:32,875 --> 00:22:34,959
-Enjoy now.
-Thank you.

379
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:37,003
That could have cost you
a few votes there, Stan.

380
00:22:37,004 --> 00:22:38,838
Now you're back to loving America.

381
00:22:38,839 --> 00:22:40,007
Thank you.

382
00:22:40,215 --> 00:22:41,341
So, how's Beau?

383
00:22:42,050 --> 00:22:42,968
What do you mean?

384
00:22:45,220 --> 00:22:46,054
How's he doing?

385
00:22:46,346 --> 00:22:49,516
You know... Don't you mean
how are the kids?

386
00:22:50,601 --> 00:22:53,604
No.
I mean, how's Beau?

387
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:57,064
And then, how's Val
and then how's Rick and...

388
00:22:57,065 --> 00:22:59,317
We don't...
Not necessarily go in that order.

389
00:22:59,318 --> 00:23:02,653
I didn't mean... I didn't mean
anything by it. I just...

390
00:23:02,654 --> 00:23:04,822
You speak so seldom
about the kids.

391
00:23:04,823 --> 00:23:06,742
Sorry, I just thought
it was odd that you were...

392
00:23:07,242 --> 00:23:11,872
That's okay. It's okay.
So, how is Beau, you know?

393
00:23:12,581 --> 00:23:13,790
Same as always.

394
00:23:16,168 --> 00:23:20,171
I, I think that he's starting
to open up with me

395
00:23:20,172 --> 00:23:23,967
and then something triggers him
and then he goes back to...

396
00:23:24,593 --> 00:23:25,719
But,

397
00:23:27,262 --> 00:23:28,639
I have hope so...

398
00:23:29,973 --> 00:23:32,851
I mean, he's always been
Barbara's boy.

399
00:23:33,268 --> 00:23:34,478
He loves ya.

400
00:23:36,313 --> 00:23:38,105
Is Val still going
to that special school?

401
00:23:40,108 --> 00:23:41,108
<i>Before and during the war,</i>

402
00:23:41,109 --> 00:23:43,945
<i>there were dozens
of breech-loading rifles and carbines.</i>

403
00:23:43,946 --> 00:23:46,072
<i>Both single... and multiple-shot.</i>

404
00:23:46,073 --> 00:23:47,324
Stan never objected.

405
00:23:48,450 --> 00:23:51,203
I couldn't leave the kids there
in that filthy orphanage.

406
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:54,498
God, his smile
just warmed my heart.

407
00:23:55,499 --> 00:23:57,125
You should've seen
the looks we got in the airport.

408
00:23:57,292 --> 00:23:58,669
I felt so complete.

409
00:23:59,461 --> 00:24:01,837
Yup, yup.
It's okay, baby.

410
00:24:01,838 --> 00:24:03,589
Honestly, I think
our marriage needed that.

411
00:24:03,590 --> 00:24:06,593
You know, with the move and all,
it's the best thing.

412
00:24:06,969 --> 00:24:09,720
-Mommy.
-Okay, Val, it's okay, calm down, honey.

413
00:24:09,721 --> 00:24:11,639
Come on. You want to take her
in the other room?

414
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:13,809
-Okay, now.
-All right.

415
00:24:17,938 --> 00:24:20,022
She can be a bit much,
sometimes.

416
00:24:20,023 --> 00:24:22,109
You know how kids are.

417
00:24:22,859 --> 00:24:25,278
-She's done really well today.
-She's a good girl.

418
00:24:25,279 --> 00:24:27,780
<i>Handguns'
both single and multiple shot,</i>

419
00:24:27,781 --> 00:24:29,699
<i>generally were carried by officers,</i>

420
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:31,075
<i>and possibly artillerymen.</i>

421
00:24:31,076 --> 00:24:33,286
<i>While the type of handguns used
by both sides were...</i>

422
00:24:33,287 --> 00:24:35,747
<i>-What are you reading, Paul?
-Two of the most common were...</i>

423
00:24:36,248 --> 00:24:37,416
It's a book.

424
00:24:38,375 --> 00:24:39,668
<i>Two of the most common were...</i>

425
00:24:39,918 --> 00:24:42,921
<i>-He's researching Gettysburg.
-Shot-and-ball by Colt and Remington.</i>

426
00:24:43,088 --> 00:24:44,380
You know, for the book
he says he's writing.

427
00:24:44,381 --> 00:24:45,756
Right.

428
00:24:50,846 --> 00:24:54,641
You should think about adopting,
Claire. You know, Michael's alone.

429
00:24:55,475 --> 00:24:58,561
I don't... I don't think
I could ever love another child.

430
00:24:58,562 --> 00:25:00,647
-Seriously.
-No, no.

431
00:25:01,106 --> 00:25:04,150
I mean, not with everything
we went through with Michael, no.

432
00:25:04,151 --> 00:25:09,114
I mean, just trying to get pregnant
and then almost losing him, no.

433
00:25:12,909 --> 00:25:14,411
I don't want to love another child.

434
00:25:15,078 --> 00:25:16,413
I wish I had your clarity.

435
00:25:17,497 --> 00:25:19,373
-Does that make me a horrible person?
-No.

436
00:25:19,374 --> 00:25:21,543
No, not at all.
That's not what I'm saying. I just...

437
00:25:23,086 --> 00:25:25,213
It adds a lot of pressure,
you know.

438
00:25:28,133 --> 00:25:29,217
I can handle it.

439
00:25:29,426 --> 00:25:30,677
Pressure on Michael.

440
00:25:31,887 --> 00:25:33,471
Can't be healthy for him.

441
00:25:33,472 --> 00:25:35,474
Beau?

442
00:25:36,975 --> 00:25:40,102
Hey. Hey.
Hey, buddy, what is it?

443
00:25:40,103 --> 00:25:41,980
It's all right.

444
00:25:42,814 --> 00:25:45,651
It's okay. You're safe here, all right?
No one's gonna harm you.

445
00:25:46,234 --> 00:25:47,944
Rick! Michael!

446
00:25:48,487 --> 00:25:49,446
Get down here.

447
00:25:49,988 --> 00:25:51,906
-What did you guys do to Beau?
-Nothing, Mom.

448
00:25:51,907 --> 00:25:54,575
-Really nothing.
-I'm not gonna ask you again.

449
00:25:54,576 --> 00:25:56,535
I just looked at him,
that's all, honestly.

450
00:25:56,536 --> 00:25:57,746
You have to stop
picking on him.

451
00:25:58,497 --> 00:25:59,538
How am I racist?

452
00:25:59,539 --> 00:26:01,750
Do I really need to spell
this out for you?

453
00:26:01,917 --> 00:26:05,879
I just think he instinctively
exploits his position in the family.

454
00:26:06,171 --> 00:26:07,713
You know, it's fascinating.

455
00:26:07,714 --> 00:26:10,841
She was never like this
with Rick or Val or Stanley.

456
00:26:10,842 --> 00:26:13,136
Are you listening to yourself?

457
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:17,683
You do realize you're accusing a child
of playing the race card.

458
00:26:18,517 --> 00:26:21,394
Exactly, it's just, it's...

459
00:26:21,395 --> 00:26:25,107
It makes sense, he's a kid.
It's survival, it's Darwinian.

460
00:26:25,315 --> 00:26:26,649
I get it, but I don't have to like it.

461
00:26:26,650 --> 00:26:29,026
I'd be a racist
if I liked the little hypocrite

462
00:26:29,027 --> 00:26:30,611
just because of
the color of his skin.

463
00:26:30,612 --> 00:26:32,113
-That's racism.
-My God.

464
00:26:32,114 --> 00:26:34,156
Or if my not liking the little shit

465
00:26:34,157 --> 00:26:37,702
affected my opinion
of Africa in general or Kenya.

466
00:26:37,703 --> 00:26:40,163
But it doesn't.
I just have a bad feeling about him.

467
00:26:42,124 --> 00:26:43,040
-I'm not a racist.
-You don't know him.

468
00:26:43,041 --> 00:26:44,835
-I'm not...
-You don't even know him.

469
00:26:45,335 --> 00:26:47,461
Well, I'm not a racist.
At best, I'm...

470
00:26:47,462 --> 00:26:51,882
Okay, okay, okay, okay,
you're not a racist. You're not.

471
00:26:51,883 --> 00:26:55,010
-Orthodox thinking.
-All right. I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

472
00:26:55,011 --> 00:26:57,138
-I'm sorry I brought it up.
-There's nothing malicious.

473
00:26:57,139 --> 00:26:58,765
-Hey, hey.
-What?

474
00:27:05,897 --> 00:27:08,108
Do you think we should have given
Michael a brother or sister?

475
00:27:08,275 --> 00:27:11,026
What?
No, God, no, no, no, no.

476
00:27:11,027 --> 00:27:13,655
Thank you, no, no.
Our family is perfect.

477
00:27:15,115 --> 00:27:17,743
Perfect-ish. Okay?

478
00:27:18,243 --> 00:27:20,536
And you can work on yourself.

479
00:27:20,537 --> 00:27:22,621
It's not a doomed marriage.
No, watch.

480
00:27:22,622 --> 00:27:24,416
They're gonna have
a fresh start in DC.

481
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,460
Who is the blind guy that said,

482
00:27:26,626 --> 00:27:29,296
"Washington DC
would make for beautiful ruins"?

483
00:27:30,797 --> 00:27:32,381
No, "wonderful," yeah.

484
00:27:32,382 --> 00:27:33,799
"Wonderful ruins."

485
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:37,928
Senator from Oklahoma.

486
00:27:37,929 --> 00:27:40,682
He was Gore Vidal's grandfather.

487
00:27:41,808 --> 00:27:44,352
-Man, now I'm gonna be up all night.
-Google it.

488
00:27:45,437 --> 00:27:47,272
That's cheating.

489
00:27:48,648 --> 00:27:50,358
It's got to be hard on Barb.

490
00:27:54,613 --> 00:27:58,241
-A needy, self-centered, little shit.
-Well, he's hardly ever home.

491
00:27:58,992 --> 00:28:01,619
I don't mean Stan.
I mean, Beau, the kid.

492
00:28:01,620 --> 00:28:02,995
Okay, shut up, "the kid."

493
00:28:02,996 --> 00:28:04,914
You realize you still sound
like a racist.

494
00:28:04,915 --> 00:28:08,834
Hey, half my students
are black, okay?

495
00:28:08,835 --> 00:28:10,711
At least. More.

496
00:28:10,712 --> 00:28:13,840
I'm the only person in my family
that cares about real people.

497
00:28:15,091 --> 00:28:18,678
You know, running for public office.
Bullshit, Stan.

498
00:28:20,055 --> 00:28:23,099
Elitist, self-serving,
just like mother raised him.

499
00:28:23,934 --> 00:28:25,393
Stan is for Stanley.

500
00:28:27,687 --> 00:28:28,854
I teach public school.

501
00:28:28,855 --> 00:28:32,107
I go to those kids' homes,
I speak with their parents.

502
00:28:32,108 --> 00:28:35,654
I help with their problems,
decently, idealistically.

503
00:28:37,614 --> 00:28:41,617
I give them money sometimes,
for, you know, whatever.

504
00:28:41,618 --> 00:28:49,209
And I don't have corporate sponsors
or lobbyists or fund-raisers.

505
00:28:51,002 --> 00:28:52,711
And I'm... I'm not racist.

506
00:28:52,712 --> 00:28:55,214
I'm a warrior for the underclass,

507
00:28:55,215 --> 00:28:58,259
and I know how to ID
an asshole in the making.

508
00:28:58,260 --> 00:29:02,931
Wow.
I'm voting for you.

509
00:29:05,767 --> 00:29:08,018
My mother and Stan. Jesus.

510
00:29:08,019 --> 00:29:10,855
Ever told you about the time
she slapped me so hard,

511
00:29:10,856 --> 00:29:14,442
-I lost consciousness.
-No.

512
00:29:16,570 --> 00:29:19,405
Well, it was,

513
00:29:19,406 --> 00:29:22,909
she was always touching him,
hugging him and...

514
00:29:24,202 --> 00:29:25,078
like some trophy.

515
00:29:26,746 --> 00:29:28,290
Right there on the staircase.

516
00:29:29,457 --> 00:29:32,669
I was, like, 11 years old, and I...

517
00:29:35,255 --> 00:29:37,132
I said, "Get a room, you two."

518
00:29:38,174 --> 00:29:40,302
And she lost it. She just...

519
00:29:42,262 --> 00:29:43,430
What was his name?

520
00:29:44,931 --> 00:29:46,891
Press called him the "blind cowboy."

521
00:29:46,892 --> 00:29:48,852
-Hey, hey, hey.
-What was his name?

522
00:29:54,024 --> 00:29:55,525
Hey, stop.

523
00:29:56,610 --> 00:29:57,861
Stop.

524
00:30:05,035 --> 00:30:07,621
That was kind of outrageous
what you said to her.

525
00:30:09,664 --> 00:30:12,584
It was worth it, though.
It got her attention.

526
00:30:15,921 --> 00:30:18,840
But you weren't really unconscious,
were you?

527
00:30:21,134 --> 00:30:26,096
Just shut my eyes for a while.
I could hear Stan crying.

528
00:30:26,097 --> 00:30:27,682
He thought she killed me.

529
00:30:28,767 --> 00:30:30,477
It was a beautiful moment.

530
00:30:35,941 --> 00:30:37,108
Thomas Gore.

531
00:30:38,652 --> 00:30:39,986
The blind senator.

532
00:30:42,822 --> 00:30:43,823
Fuck Google.

533
00:30:46,701 --> 00:30:48,036
Fuck Google.

534
00:31:03,510 --> 00:31:05,887
Mr. Lohman. Are we okay?

535
00:31:06,513 --> 00:31:08,223
Are we okay?
I don't know, Heinz.

536
00:31:08,807 --> 00:31:10,225
I don't know.
Do you have kids?

537
00:31:10,767 --> 00:31:13,811
-No, I don't.
-Why not?

538
00:31:13,812 --> 00:31:16,397
I have pure selfishness.

539
00:31:16,398 --> 00:31:18,525
I haven't stopped
being a kid yet myself.

540
00:31:19,901 --> 00:31:23,363
I think it's more selfish to have kids
than to not have them.

541
00:31:23,613 --> 00:31:24,655
Yeah.

542
00:31:24,656 --> 00:31:26,282
And talking about them is worse.

543
00:31:26,992 --> 00:31:28,368
-Right?
-Yeah. Sure.

544
00:31:29,536 --> 00:31:31,204
We were duped into having kids

545
00:31:31,955 --> 00:31:33,414
by our genes

546
00:31:33,415 --> 00:31:37,918
who need to create hosts
to propagate themselves

547
00:31:37,919 --> 00:31:40,839
to ensure their survival
and to create future generations.

548
00:31:42,257 --> 00:31:43,882
-That's what I think.
-Kinda dark.

549
00:31:43,883 --> 00:31:45,677
-Yeah, it's kinda bleak.
-Yeah.

550
00:31:46,261 --> 00:31:47,928
You chose well, Heinz.

551
00:31:47,929 --> 00:31:49,472
Don't let the fuckers
get you down.

552
00:31:50,682 --> 00:31:53,768
Who are the fuckers?
The... the kids?

553
00:31:55,228 --> 00:31:56,895
People who want you
to have kids?

554
00:31:56,896 --> 00:31:58,897
The genes, Heinz, the genes.

555
00:31:58,898 --> 00:32:00,649
Of course. The genes.

556
00:32:00,650 --> 00:32:01,526
Yeah.

557
00:32:02,819 --> 00:32:05,779
Would your genes like a cocktail
while you're here?

558
00:32:05,780 --> 00:32:08,700
I think they would.

559
00:32:08,867 --> 00:32:10,325
-Good.
-That's the feeling I get.

560
00:32:10,326 --> 00:32:11,410
What would you like?

561
00:32:11,411 --> 00:32:12,412
A whiskey soda.

562
00:32:12,662 --> 00:32:14,873
Absolutely, no problem.
Coming right up.

563
00:32:27,385 --> 00:32:30,055
Yo, let's get some beer
before we get the cab.

564
00:32:30,722 --> 00:32:32,598
I'm tired.

565
00:32:32,599 --> 00:32:34,893
So what? So am I.

566
00:32:35,143 --> 00:32:36,978
-The door's busted.
-I mean, you only had, like, three.

567
00:32:37,854 --> 00:32:38,772
What happened?

568
00:32:39,022 --> 00:32:40,190
That was fucking quick.

569
00:32:41,441 --> 00:32:42,901
-What's going on?
-There's somebody in there.

570
00:32:43,485 --> 00:32:45,236
Smells like shit.

571
00:32:45,445 --> 00:32:46,488
It's disgusting.

572
00:32:46,696 --> 00:32:47,614
Shit.

573
00:32:49,407 --> 00:32:51,576
-Is he dead?
-I think so.

574
00:32:55,455 --> 00:32:57,539
-Paul...
-Turns out, hitting the head

575
00:32:57,540 --> 00:32:59,291
was really an excellent idea.

576
00:32:59,292 --> 00:33:00,751
Should've thought of it myself.

577
00:33:00,752 --> 00:33:03,379
You're such a filthy little asshole.

578
00:33:09,886 --> 00:33:11,595
All right.
I guess it's just the three of us.

579
00:33:11,596 --> 00:33:13,097
I can talk to her later about this.

580
00:33:13,098 --> 00:33:15,600
-I think she wants someone to follow her.
-Really?

581
00:33:15,767 --> 00:33:19,269
Yeah, I think that's normally how
it works in the kingdom of the apes.

582
00:33:19,270 --> 00:33:20,522
I'll go.

583
00:33:21,689 --> 00:33:24,150
That's probably better.
Thank you. Thanks.

584
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:29,029
I can't be a father again.
I can't do it.

585
00:33:29,030 --> 00:33:30,824
She keeps talking about this,
but I can't do it.

586
00:33:31,199 --> 00:33:32,241
You know, she's young.

587
00:33:32,242 --> 00:33:35,035
She deserves to have her own kids.
I can't go there.

588
00:33:35,036 --> 00:33:36,121
And she brings this up.

589
00:33:36,996 --> 00:33:38,580
She uses it as a distraction,

590
00:33:38,581 --> 00:33:42,210
so I... change the subject at hand.

591
00:33:45,463 --> 00:33:47,798
That's why I think it's good she's
talking to another woman about it.

592
00:33:47,799 --> 00:33:49,467
She doesn't have many women friends.

593
00:33:50,385 --> 00:33:51,510
-So sorry.
-Yeah.

594
00:33:51,511 --> 00:33:53,847
-Another change happened.
-What have we got?

595
00:33:56,432 --> 00:33:57,725
Okay.

596
00:33:59,227 --> 00:34:02,020
All right. Well, just check
and make sure these dates work.

597
00:34:02,021 --> 00:34:04,189
Okay? And I will help him
on Appropriations,

598
00:34:04,190 --> 00:34:05,899
but he's got to bring
Goren and Hazelton with him

599
00:34:05,900 --> 00:34:07,359
-to my bill, okay?
-Okay.

600
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:08,861
-Yeah.
-Parity needs them.

601
00:34:08,862 --> 00:34:09,904
Okay, thanks.

602
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:11,322
She's terrific.

603
00:34:11,656 --> 00:34:14,241
There's someone with a sense of
commitment, dedication. I'm serious.

604
00:34:14,242 --> 00:34:16,118
Yeah, I'm there sure is, Stan.

605
00:34:16,119 --> 00:34:18,287
So what's the subject at hand,

606
00:34:18,288 --> 00:34:19,872
why you invited us
out for dinner and all?

607
00:34:19,873 --> 00:34:22,541
You know what it is.
We're way past that point.

608
00:34:22,542 --> 00:34:24,001
We're all very good
at pretending.

609
00:34:24,002 --> 00:34:26,462
But we have to do something.
Something has to be done here.

610
00:34:29,883 --> 00:34:31,050
And for the record,

611
00:34:31,676 --> 00:34:33,803
I didn't even know those boys
were going to the party that night.

612
00:34:35,180 --> 00:34:37,347
-Does Katelyn know?
-Yes, she knows.

613
00:34:37,348 --> 00:34:39,475
She knows now.
That's why, that's why...

614
00:34:40,810 --> 00:34:43,228
And I'm assuming that Claire
knows everything?

615
00:34:43,229 --> 00:34:44,563
Don't, don't assume.

616
00:34:44,564 --> 00:34:46,732
For God's sake, man,
come on.

617
00:34:46,733 --> 00:34:48,734
We don't talk about painful things.

618
00:34:48,735 --> 00:34:50,695
She's been through a lot.
I don't want her to get sick again.

619
00:34:52,697 --> 00:34:54,656
I don't, I don't get you,

620
00:34:54,657 --> 00:34:57,826
I don't get your life. I...

621
00:34:57,827 --> 00:34:59,829
Who asked you
to get anything?

622
00:35:04,334 --> 00:35:05,375
Nobody.

623
00:35:12,842 --> 00:35:15,093
My. Well, my bad.

624
00:35:15,094 --> 00:35:16,970
Would you like to wait
until the ladies return to the table?

625
00:35:16,971 --> 00:35:18,722
No. No. Just put them down.
It's fine.

626
00:35:18,723 --> 00:35:20,974
-Okay. Very well, Congressman.
-They'll be back, sorry.

627
00:35:20,975 --> 00:35:21,851
Thank you.

628
00:35:22,018 --> 00:35:23,810
Here we have
guinea-hen and yolk

629
00:35:23,811 --> 00:35:26,897
in a nest of foraged mushrooms
on a bed of mustard...

630
00:35:26,898 --> 00:35:28,565
That's okay.
We don't need the summary.

631
00:35:28,566 --> 00:35:29,942
-No, I want to hear more.
-Really delicious.

632
00:35:29,943 --> 00:35:30,818
-Easy.
-It was fun.

633
00:35:34,364 --> 00:35:35,530
Heinz, I thought we were friends.

634
00:35:35,531 --> 00:35:38,867
-May I, Congressman, for your brother?
-Sure, go for it.

635
00:35:38,868 --> 00:35:42,537
He's having line-caught
steelhead trout...

636
00:35:42,538 --> 00:35:43,665
Paul, please.

637
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,711
-I'm so sorry.
-Yeah, that's okay.

638
00:35:50,421 --> 00:35:51,421
He'll be back.

639
00:35:51,422 --> 00:35:52,923
<i>Most women
get sick of Stan</i>

640
00:35:52,924 --> 00:35:55,677

644
00:36:14,153 --> 00:36:17,156

heard from her in a while.</i>

645
00:36:18,616 --> 00:36:21,076

is, as a warning,</i>

646
00:36:21,077 --> 00:36:22,370
<i>in case you're falling for him.</i>

647
00:36:22,787 --> 00:36:24,497
<i>Everyone falls for Stan.</i>

648
00:36:25,081 --> 00:36:27,125
<i>Once you fall for him,
I can't protect you.</i>

649
00:36:27,542 --> 00:36:28,584
<i>He's not my friend.</i>

650
00:36:29,210 --> 00:36:32,422

for, like, forever.

678
00:38:11,229 --> 00:38:15,400
Well, we'll be home
in an hour or so, so...

679
00:38:16,234 --> 00:38:17,943
No, no, I need it now.

680
00:38:17,944 --> 00:38:20,570
I, I just need some numbers.

681
00:38:20,571 --> 00:38:22,364
<i>You can ask me and I'll...</i>

682
00:38:22,365 --> 00:38:24,574
I can look them up for you.

683
00:38:24,575 --> 00:38:28,579
I mean, what's... Is the passcode,
the same as always?

684
00:38:30,623 --> 00:38:31,624
It's okay.

685
00:38:32,458 --> 00:38:34,543
I'll just come and get it.
Don't worry about it.

686
00:38:34,544 --> 00:38:36,545
<i>-How?
-I don't know.</i>

687
00:38:36,546 --> 00:38:39,089
<i>-I'll ride my bike.
-What? No.</i>

688
00:38:39,090 --> 00:38:41,299
Don't come up here.
It's too far.

689
00:38:48,433 --> 00:38:51,143
Hey, do you mind giving me
a ride someplace?

690
00:38:51,144 --> 00:38:52,561
It will take five minutes.

691
00:38:52,562 --> 00:38:55,147
But you know, sometimes I think
I'm actually going to lose my mind.

692
00:38:55,148 --> 00:38:56,441
Claire?

693
00:38:58,526 --> 00:39:00,777
Paul.

694
00:39:00,778 --> 00:39:03,865
Dear sweet Paul.

695
00:39:04,323 --> 00:39:07,201
I am a monster for keeping
your wife away.

696
00:39:07,577 --> 00:39:09,995
Yes, you are, Kate.
Yes, you are.

697
00:39:09,996 --> 00:39:11,079
Far from it.

698
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:14,624
She's been patiently listening
to my complaints about work.

699
00:39:14,625 --> 00:39:16,752
Sometimes,
it's just nice to connect.

700
00:39:17,795 --> 00:39:19,714
You never complain, do you, Kate?

701
00:39:20,506 --> 00:39:22,174
I mean, honestly,
I've never seen anything like it.

702
00:39:22,175 --> 00:39:26,304
Really? Well,
never complain, never explain.

703
00:39:26,721 --> 00:39:29,348
That's how my father raised me,
for better or worse.

704
00:39:31,767 --> 00:39:33,853
I don't have anything
to complain about.

705
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:40,484
I mean, we all don't.
We're blessed.

706
00:39:40,485 --> 00:39:42,360
Go inside. It's cold,

707
00:39:42,361 --> 00:39:44,572
and the Congressman
is getting very lonely.

708
00:39:46,908 --> 00:39:51,662
I just... just, I just want everyone
to be happy.

709
00:39:53,581 --> 00:39:55,166
Is that so outrageous?

710
00:39:56,542 --> 00:39:57,877
Of course not.

711
00:39:58,586 --> 00:40:00,171
I'll be in in a second.

712
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:08,136
<i>Hey, Beau here.
Tonight's okay.</i>

713
00:40:08,137 --> 00:40:10,138
<i>Let's get it done tonight.
Get it over with.</i>

714
00:40:10,139 --> 00:40:12,391
<i>I'll see you there, wuss.</i>

715
00:40:20,066 --> 00:40:22,693
<i>Hi, love, it's Mom.
I'm on my way home.</i>

716
00:40:23,152 --> 00:40:24,819
<i>Dad and I are going out
to a restaurant</i>

717
00:40:24,820 --> 00:40:26,280
<i>and I'll make sure
that we stay out late.</i>

718
00:40:26,572 --> 00:40:28,073
<i>Your father doesn't know
about tonight</i>

719
00:40:28,074 --> 00:40:29,575
<i>and I'd like to keep it that way.</i>

720
00:40:29,992 --> 00:40:31,702
<i>I'll check in with you around 10:00.</i>

721
00:40:32,453 --> 00:40:33,787
<i>Please don't stress.</i>

722
00:40:33,788 --> 00:40:36,081
<i>Take your bike.
It's all gonna be fine.</i>

723
00:40:36,082 --> 00:40:38,501
<i>Nobody will ever find out
if we just keep cool.</i>

724
00:40:42,004 --> 00:40:43,214
Dad?

725
00:40:44,048 --> 00:40:45,633
Hey. Hey-hey.

726
00:40:46,676 --> 00:40:48,051
I thought I'd meet you outside.

727
00:40:48,052 --> 00:40:50,972
I really feel guilty about the phone.

728
00:40:51,138 --> 00:40:53,099
Here you go.

729
00:40:54,684 --> 00:40:55,934
Were you just on my phone?

730
00:40:55,935 --> 00:40:58,603
Who were you talking to?

731
00:40:58,604 --> 00:41:01,440
-You.
-What?

732
00:41:01,732 --> 00:41:02,899
I just was trying to call you.

733
00:41:02,900 --> 00:41:05,610
I was worried about where you were.

734
00:41:05,611 --> 00:41:07,154
This is my phone.

735
00:41:07,863 --> 00:41:10,031
How were you trying to call me
on my own phone?

736
00:41:10,032 --> 00:41:13,077
You know, I guess
I'm losing my mind.

737
00:41:13,619 --> 00:41:14,996
Again.

738
00:41:15,663 --> 00:41:19,040
<i>You really think he's dead.
I guess...</i>

739
00:41:19,041 --> 00:41:21,626
<i>It's just fucked up
this whole thing.</i>

740
00:41:21,627 --> 00:41:23,295
<i>I think he's still breathing.</i>

741
00:41:23,296 --> 00:41:24,671
<i>The fucker probably died...</i>

742
00:41:24,672 --> 00:41:26,340
<i>He probably died in his sleep.</i>

743
00:41:27,508 --> 00:41:30,176
<i>-I don't know, that's really horrible.
-It's not horrible. Don't be scared.</i>

744
00:41:30,177 --> 00:41:32,721
<i>-Calm down.
-Are you getting the money or not?</i>

745
00:41:32,722 --> 00:41:33,931
<i>-Let's go.
-Tell me about...</i>

746
00:41:34,849 --> 00:41:37,934
<i>Come on.</i>

747
00:41:37,935 --> 00:41:39,520
<i>Who cares? Just go!</i>

748
00:41:39,895 --> 00:41:41,606
Just do what Michael tells you.

749
00:41:43,441 --> 00:41:46,193
God. Jesus!

750
00:41:46,694 --> 00:41:48,028
Let's get out of here.

751
00:41:48,029 --> 00:41:49,446
Well, don't be a pussy.

752
00:41:49,447 --> 00:41:51,156
Come on,
he's a fucking homeless bum.

753
00:41:51,157 --> 00:41:52,407
I think he's still alive.

754
00:41:52,408 --> 00:41:54,117
Just find another ATM.

755
00:41:54,118 --> 00:41:55,995
Come on,
don't be a pussy.

756
00:41:57,371 --> 00:41:58,623
Jesus.

757
00:42:00,916 --> 00:42:02,000
Come on.

758
00:42:02,001 --> 00:42:03,044
Hey, yo, get up.

759
00:42:04,170 --> 00:42:05,630
Get the fuck up.

760
00:42:06,005 --> 00:42:07,380
The guy's probably deranged.

761
00:42:07,381 --> 00:42:08,883
Well, I'm outta here.

762
00:42:09,383 --> 00:42:11,426
-You're such a fuck...
-Beau, come on.

763
00:42:11,427 --> 00:42:12,886
-Fuck you.
-Come on. Get back here.

764
00:42:12,887 --> 00:42:14,472
-You're a little bitch.
-How are you gonna get home?

765
00:42:15,264 --> 00:42:16,682
Look.

766
00:42:17,099 --> 00:42:18,851
We still need the cab, jeez.

767
00:42:19,226 --> 00:42:22,021
Look at this, really a piece of shit.

768
00:42:23,230 --> 00:42:25,941
Hey! Why don't you get up?

769
00:42:26,567 --> 00:42:28,318
Hey, stink-o!

770
00:42:28,319 --> 00:42:29,904
Why don't you get the fuck up?

771
00:42:30,363 --> 00:42:31,822
Smells like rotten eggs.

772
00:42:32,990 --> 00:42:34,325
Probably got some
fucking food in there.

773
00:42:35,701 --> 00:42:38,204
Hey, mister. Get up!

774
00:42:38,996 --> 00:42:40,580
There's one of you
and there's two of us.

775
00:42:40,581 --> 00:42:41,790
You better get the fuck up.

776
00:42:41,791 --> 00:42:43,918
Come on, get up.

777
00:42:45,044 --> 00:42:46,337
Leave me alone.

778
00:42:46,587 --> 00:42:48,381
-Shit.
-What do you want?

779
00:42:49,090 --> 00:42:51,967
What are you waiting for?
Get out of here.

780
00:42:52,968 --> 00:42:54,844
Get out. Just fuck off.

781
00:42:54,845 --> 00:42:57,347
Go find some place else to sleep.
Get a fucking job.

782
00:42:57,348 --> 00:42:59,349
You shut your face, you little shit.

783
00:42:59,350 --> 00:43:01,601
Hey, why don't you
shut your face, witch?

784
00:43:01,602 --> 00:43:04,354
Shut up, you little fucker.
I said get out of here.

785
00:43:04,355 --> 00:43:07,732
My God, get the fuck out.
You spoiled piece of shit.

786
00:43:07,733 --> 00:43:10,235
You fucking treat me like a lady or...

787
00:43:10,236 --> 00:43:11,152
Shit.

788
00:43:11,153 --> 00:43:12,363
What are you doing?
Shit.

789
00:43:12,905 --> 00:43:14,281
-Get out of here.
-No, don't. Come on.

790
00:43:14,907 --> 00:43:16,866
You don't know what the fuck...

791
00:43:16,867 --> 00:43:18,034
Let's find out.

792
00:43:18,035 --> 00:43:19,494
Stop it. You get out of here.

793
00:43:19,495 --> 00:43:22,038
-You leave me alone.
-Fuck you!

794
00:43:22,039 --> 00:43:25,166
-My God.
-Don't. Leave me alone.

795
00:43:25,167 --> 00:43:27,335
Get out of here.
Get out...

796
00:43:27,336 --> 00:43:29,254
-My God.
-You get out.

797
00:43:29,255 --> 00:43:32,133
-Wait, wait, wait. I got an idea.
-Like what?

798
00:43:32,425 --> 00:43:34,008
-Leave me. You go and leave me alone.
-Holy shit.

799
00:43:34,009 --> 00:43:35,344
Just leave me.

800
00:43:36,387 --> 00:43:38,096
-Garbage to garbage.
-You fucking shit.

801
00:43:38,097 --> 00:43:40,515
No. Shit!

802
00:43:40,516 --> 00:43:42,225
Dude, come on. Move, let's go.

803
00:43:42,226 --> 00:43:43,978
We're outta here.

804
00:43:45,020 --> 00:43:47,856
-Look.
-Fuck.

805
00:43:47,857 --> 00:43:49,858
You threw it all in her face.

806
00:43:49,859 --> 00:43:51,819
Filthy piece of shit.

807
00:43:55,573 --> 00:43:58,409
<i>-You looked, didn't you?
-I did. I know. I saw.</i>

808
00:43:59,493 --> 00:44:02,829
This is getting weird

809
00:44:02,830 --> 00:44:04,122
talking about this right now.

810
00:44:04,123 --> 00:44:04,998
Weird?

811
00:44:04,999 --> 00:44:07,251
That's... That's
a weird choice of word.

812
00:44:08,461 --> 00:44:09,920
It was just supposed to be a joke.

813
00:44:10,254 --> 00:44:12,673
You threw a burning match
at her as a joke?

814
00:44:13,549 --> 00:44:15,718
She shouldn't have been there.
I mean...

815
00:44:17,303 --> 00:44:19,555
The whole place stunk, Dad.

816
00:44:20,055 --> 00:44:21,347
She yelled at us.

817
00:44:21,348 --> 00:44:23,933
She cursed us.
I mean, she threatened us, Dad.

818
00:44:23,934 --> 00:44:27,020
We just needed the money
to get home, that's all. Okay?

819
00:44:27,021 --> 00:44:29,272
But she was like a fucking animal.

820
00:44:29,273 --> 00:44:31,816
She was like a raccoon
or something.

821
00:44:31,817 --> 00:44:34,570
And we just couldn't get her out.
That's all. We couldn't do it.

822
00:44:35,279 --> 00:44:37,197
I mean, you would've done
the same exact thing.

823
00:44:37,198 --> 00:44:38,616
My God. Really?

824
00:44:39,575 --> 00:44:41,160
What did she do?

825
00:44:42,661 --> 00:44:44,497
I...

826
00:44:45,623 --> 00:44:48,583
She's got to go. Get home and...

827
00:44:48,584 --> 00:44:50,752
Okay, look, I get it.

828
00:44:50,753 --> 00:44:53,171
-Okay?
-Okay.

829
00:44:53,172 --> 00:44:55,006
-Can we talk about it later?
-There's no need.

830
00:44:55,007 --> 00:44:57,718
As long as nothing happens,
nothing happens.

831
00:44:59,595 --> 00:45:01,930
-Are you being serious?
-Hey, Michael Lohman,

832
00:45:01,931 --> 00:45:04,141
you've known me 16 years,
am I serious? Come on.

833
00:45:05,518 --> 00:45:06,811
I can't tell.

834
00:45:07,603 --> 00:45:10,063
Time is what we need.
Time is on our side.

835
00:45:10,064 --> 00:45:11,231
Time is our friend.

836
00:45:11,232 --> 00:45:13,024
You know?
That's how news cycle works.

837
00:45:13,025 --> 00:45:14,692
It's old news already.

838
00:45:14,693 --> 00:45:16,737
It's...
You know, you got lucky.

839
00:45:17,238 --> 00:45:18,571
We got lucky.

840
00:45:18,572 --> 00:45:20,490
You know I remember
when I was a teacher,

841
00:45:20,491 --> 00:45:22,450
time was, it was not...
It was not like this.

842
00:45:22,451 --> 00:45:23,701
-Okay.
-Time was... It was different.

843
00:45:23,702 --> 00:45:26,664
Stop, stop, stop, stop.
Okay. Okay.

844
00:45:27,748 --> 00:45:30,668
You're gonna spin out, okay?
You just need to stop talking.

845
00:45:31,043 --> 00:45:32,669
Okay.

846
00:45:32,670 --> 00:45:34,004
-Okay?
-Okay.

847
00:45:34,547 --> 00:45:37,841
All I am saying is,
we'll get through this.

848
00:45:37,842 --> 00:45:39,301
-Yup.
-We always do.

849
00:45:40,094 --> 00:45:42,053
-You and me, right?
-Yeah.

850
00:45:42,054 --> 00:45:44,430
You and that basketball,
you know.

851
00:45:44,431 --> 00:45:46,724
-Yeah.
-I got this under control.

852
00:45:46,725 --> 00:45:49,352
Yeah, I always do.
I always do.

853
00:45:49,353 --> 00:45:50,812
You remember
when you threw that ball, and I...

854
00:45:50,813 --> 00:45:52,230
But I went in there, I said,

855
00:45:52,231 --> 00:45:53,690
-"The rap," so I took the rap.
-Dad, seriously, shut up.

856
00:45:53,691 --> 00:45:55,400
That's what...
That's what fathers do.

857
00:45:55,401 --> 00:45:56,402
I don't know what you're talking about.

858
00:45:57,695 --> 00:45:59,113
I didn't throw that ball.

859
00:46:01,740 --> 00:46:03,450
I got this.

860
00:46:50,873 --> 00:46:53,583
I'll pay for the damages.
He did it on purpose.

861
00:46:53,584 --> 00:46:55,043
Just give him his ball back.
It was an accident.

862
00:46:55,044 --> 00:46:55,919
What do you think I am?

863
00:46:55,920 --> 00:46:57,545
A kid can't throw that strong.

864
00:46:57,546 --> 00:46:59,047
Why would I want
to break your window?

865
00:46:59,048 --> 00:47:00,381
How the fuck would I know?

866
00:47:00,382 --> 00:47:01,716
Dude. You mind?

867
00:47:03,844 --> 00:47:05,011
Just tell me the truth.

868
00:47:05,012 --> 00:47:07,180
I came here to pay
for your lame-ass window,

869
00:47:07,181 --> 00:47:08,307
not to hear you talk.

870
00:47:09,183 --> 00:47:11,685
You have no idea what we're going
through right now, okay?

871
00:47:12,561 --> 00:47:14,271
He's sorry. He said as much.

872
00:47:14,480 --> 00:47:16,941
That ball is like
his best friend.

873
00:47:17,316 --> 00:47:18,942
Shit happens.
Things gets broken.

874
00:47:18,943 --> 00:47:20,693
I asked you to name your price.

875
00:47:20,694 --> 00:47:22,820
-Be civilized.
-I'm being more than civilized.

876
00:47:22,821 --> 00:47:24,490
I'm being fucking magnanimous.

877
00:47:25,699 --> 00:47:26,783
-You fucking kidding me?
-Goddamn it!

878
00:47:26,784 --> 00:47:29,494
-How much for the goddamn window?
-It is not about the money.

879
00:47:29,495 --> 00:47:30,787
I have money.
I could buy this store if I wanted to.

880
00:47:30,788 --> 00:47:33,207
Burn it to the ground.
Save a few lives.

881
00:47:37,711 --> 00:47:39,003
I remember you.

882
00:47:39,004 --> 00:47:42,340
Your wife, she used
to come here all the time,

883
00:47:42,341 --> 00:47:43,508
to buy cigarettes.

884
00:47:43,509 --> 00:47:45,177
Well, she won't any longer,

885
00:47:46,053 --> 00:47:47,388
because you killed her.

886
00:48:01,276 --> 00:48:02,987
I don't want to be with sick people.

887
00:48:04,071 --> 00:48:06,407
No, listen.

888
00:48:08,242 --> 00:48:09,993
Good morning, Claire.

889
00:48:09,994 --> 00:48:11,161
Good morning, doctor.

890
00:48:12,162 --> 00:48:15,040
You're looking pretty today.
Are you expecting guests?

891
00:48:15,791 --> 00:48:16,875
Any minute.

892
00:48:17,459 --> 00:48:21,796
-Is she going to die?
-What? No, no, I'm just saying...

893
00:48:21,797 --> 00:48:24,465
Okay.
You seem like an old man.

894
00:48:24,466 --> 00:48:27,176
Look at you.
Let's go home.

895
00:48:27,177 --> 00:48:30,972
All right, let's just,
let's just go once around

896
00:48:30,973 --> 00:48:33,558
and get outta here.

897
00:48:33,559 --> 00:48:36,603
I like doing this.
Let's go around again.

898
00:48:37,604 --> 00:48:40,983
See how fast we can go.

899
00:48:42,609 --> 00:48:43,610
Okay, give me the phone.

900
00:48:44,194 --> 00:48:45,611
You got to get rid of that footage.

901
00:48:45,612 --> 00:48:46,696
Deleting it won't be enough.

902
00:48:46,697 --> 00:48:47,947
-Dad, stop it.
-You just gotta break the card out.

903
00:48:47,948 --> 00:48:50,033
-Come on.
-Maybe she just... Give me the phone.

904
00:48:50,034 --> 00:48:52,076
-No. I...
-This is not a game, Michael!

905
00:48:52,077 --> 00:48:53,870
-Hey, you mind?
-You got to give me that goddamn phone.

906
00:48:53,871 --> 00:48:54,705
-Hey, Mike.
-I'll be right there.

907
00:48:55,831 --> 00:48:58,332
She smokes?
You told me she didn't smoke.

908
00:48:58,333 --> 00:48:59,625
You know how your mom and I
feel about smoke.

909
00:48:59,626 --> 00:49:00,585
You fucking scared her, okay?

910
00:49:00,586 --> 00:49:02,587
God. You're being
such a fucking weirdo.

911
00:49:02,588 --> 00:49:04,213
-She's an adult, you know.
-Just keep your voice down.

912
00:49:04,214 --> 00:49:05,090
Does she know about this?

913
00:49:05,507 --> 00:49:08,426
-What? About Mom's cancer?
-No, about the ATM.

914
00:49:08,427 --> 00:49:10,762
No, of course, she doesn't know
about that, come on.

915
00:49:15,059 --> 00:49:17,894
Why the hell did you and Rick have to
post that goddamn stuff online?

916
00:49:17,895 --> 00:49:21,231
-Do you think it was funny?
-It wasn't us, okay?

917
00:49:22,775 --> 00:49:25,777
-Are you listening to me?
-Jesus Christ. Yes. I am.

918
00:49:25,778 --> 00:49:27,153
I am listening.

919
00:49:27,154 --> 00:49:28,654
You're the one
who is not fucking listening.

920
00:49:28,655 --> 00:49:30,239
I listened to you.
I listened to you too much.

921
00:49:30,240 --> 00:49:31,616
Where are you going?
What are you doing?

922
00:49:31,617 --> 00:49:33,076
-Who posted it online?
-Stop it.

923
00:49:33,077 --> 00:49:34,787
Who posted it if it wasn't you?

924
00:49:35,037 --> 00:49:37,413
You can't walk away from this.
That video will haunt you

925
00:49:37,414 --> 00:49:39,207
-for the rest of your life.
-Dad, for the last time,

926
00:49:39,208 --> 00:49:41,168
shut the fuck up, okay?

927
00:49:41,960 --> 00:49:43,961
God!
Anna is gonna take me home

928
00:49:43,962 --> 00:49:45,463
and then I've got some stuff to do.

929
00:49:45,464 --> 00:49:49,801
But you stay the fuck
out of my business, okay?

930
00:49:49,802 --> 00:49:50,802
You're a big talker.

931
00:49:50,803 --> 00:49:53,930
Goddamn it.
You're such a fucking child.

932
00:49:53,931 --> 00:49:55,389
-Okay, I'll just shut up.
-Yeah.

933
00:49:55,390 --> 00:49:57,141
I'll just shut up.
I'll keep quiet.

934
00:49:57,142 --> 00:49:58,142
When are you gonna act normal?

935
00:49:58,143 --> 00:49:59,435
-For once.
-Boy.

936
00:49:59,436 --> 00:50:00,895
-I do my best.
-Yeah?

937
00:50:00,896 --> 00:50:03,732
Well, your best
is pretty fucking lame.

938
00:50:35,055 --> 00:50:36,889
Sweetheart,
what are you doing here?

939
00:50:36,890 --> 00:50:37,850
I thought you had a meeting.

940
00:50:38,517 --> 00:50:40,017
Dad stole my phone.

941
00:50:40,018 --> 00:50:41,894
-No, I didn't.
-And he watched it.

942
00:50:41,895 --> 00:50:43,689
There was a mixup.
I thought it was mine.

943
00:50:46,275 --> 00:50:47,568
How much do you know?

944
00:50:49,611 --> 00:50:51,071
How much do you know?

945
00:50:54,616 --> 00:50:56,242
Paul, maybe you should go inside.

946
00:50:56,243 --> 00:50:57,785
You've been out here a long time

947
00:50:57,786 --> 00:50:59,746
and they're wondering if you left.

948
00:51:01,206 --> 00:51:04,125
I'm not hungry and don't talk to me
like I'm a retard.

949
00:51:04,126 --> 00:51:06,712
Mike, come on, this is crazy.
I'm outta here.

950
00:51:09,047 --> 00:51:10,090
Go.

951
00:51:23,937 --> 00:51:25,606
I thought you were on my side.

952
00:51:27,566 --> 00:51:29,525
You have to know
that first and foremost,

953
00:51:29,526 --> 00:51:31,653
I was thinking about you
and your well-being.

954
00:51:33,071 --> 00:51:34,739
I was afraid you wouldn't
be able to handle this.

955
00:51:34,740 --> 00:51:35,948
Since... Since when?

956
00:51:35,949 --> 00:51:38,201
-How long have you known about this?
-Honey.

957
00:51:38,202 --> 00:51:43,247
You know, Michael said he and Rick
didn't put that hideous video online.

958
00:51:43,248 --> 00:51:44,374
-They didn't.
-Who did?

959
00:51:44,917 --> 00:51:46,959
-Honey, it really doesn't...
-Who? Stop calling me honey.

960
00:51:46,960 --> 00:51:48,503
-You know, you better tell me...
-Beau!

961
00:51:50,088 --> 00:51:51,215
Beau did it.

962
00:51:52,841 --> 00:51:56,260
He found it on Rick's computer,
the footage that they shot...

963
00:51:56,261 --> 00:51:58,304
Where's Michael going?
He's not...

964
00:51:58,305 --> 00:52:00,348
He's gonna go pay Beau the money
that he wants to keep quiet.

965
00:52:00,349 --> 00:52:04,393
-Are you fucking kidding me?
-Calm down. He'll keep quiet.

966
00:52:04,394 --> 00:52:06,771
-What are you...
-It's under control. He's just, he's angry.

967
00:52:06,772 --> 00:52:08,397
He's angry at Michael
for calling him a wuss.

968
00:52:08,398 --> 00:52:09,315
Where's the money coming from?

969
00:52:09,316 --> 00:52:10,817
It's coming from our account.
What do you think?

970
00:52:11,360 --> 00:52:12,568
It's only a few thousand.

971
00:52:12,569 --> 00:52:14,779
-A few?
-No, then, everything's gonna be fine.

972
00:52:14,780 --> 00:52:17,114
How long have you known
that it's Rick and Michael?

973
00:52:17,115 --> 00:52:18,909
-Honey.
-Since when exactly. You tell me.

974
00:52:22,329 --> 00:52:24,164
Michael called me
after it happened.

975
00:52:25,415 --> 00:52:26,582
They needed a ride home.

976
00:52:26,583 --> 00:52:28,125
Jesus, you liar!

977
00:52:28,126 --> 00:52:30,087
-Just stop it.
-You thief.

978
00:52:30,879 --> 00:52:31,964
Calm down.

979
00:52:34,716 --> 00:52:37,426
Do they know about
Beau and tonight?

980
00:52:37,427 --> 00:52:38,886
No, no, I have it under control.

981
00:52:38,887 --> 00:52:40,846
Do you? You keep saying that
which means you don't.

982
00:52:40,847 --> 00:52:43,266
What, what are you,
are you in charge?

983
00:52:43,267 --> 00:52:44,392
What's my role in this family?

984
00:52:44,393 --> 00:52:46,811
Who am I? Who...
The village idiot?

985
00:52:46,812 --> 00:52:50,398
This whole time, it's...
I've been the odd man out.

986
00:52:50,399 --> 00:52:52,150
It's been you and Michael.

987
00:52:52,943 --> 00:52:57,030
And I'm just, you know,
I'm just, it's, it's, I'm alone.

988
00:52:57,447 --> 00:52:59,116
-No.
-I'm alone.

989
00:53:00,367 --> 00:53:01,409
You are his father.

990
00:53:01,410 --> 00:53:03,703
No, I'm... I'm the lunatic.

991
00:53:03,704 --> 00:53:06,122
It's... It's Gettysburg.

992
00:53:06,123 --> 00:53:08,165
You're going back to Gettysburg.

993
00:53:08,166 --> 00:53:09,543
No, its not.
It's not Gettysburg.

994
00:53:10,877 --> 00:53:14,756
It's not Gettysburg.
Okay?

995
00:53:17,092 --> 00:53:18,260
Let's go in.

996
00:53:21,013 --> 00:53:22,055
It's cold.

997
00:53:25,100 --> 00:53:26,809
<i>That wars are won or lost</i>

998
00:53:26,810 --> 00:53:29,687
<i>on the basis of irrational
considerations.</i>

999
00:53:29,688 --> 00:53:33,108
<i>Like Hitler and Stalingrad.
Remember that?</i>

1000
00:53:33,775 --> 00:53:35,151
As it happened,

1001
00:53:35,152 --> 00:53:38,030
for General Lee
and the Confederate Army,

1002
00:53:38,655 --> 00:53:42,075
Gettysburg was the beginning
of the end.

1003
00:53:56,965 --> 00:54:00,510
May I please
have your fucking attention?

1004
00:54:04,890 --> 00:54:06,641
There you are.

1005
00:54:11,772 --> 00:54:12,855
Good.

1006
00:54:12,856 --> 00:54:16,610
Well, now that
I have your attention,

1007
00:54:18,236 --> 00:54:20,614
I'd like you to think
about something

1008
00:54:21,698 --> 00:54:25,035
when you go home
to your miserable lives tonight.

1009
00:54:28,622 --> 00:54:30,540
I want you to think about this.

1010
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:33,502
How many people

1011
00:54:35,962 --> 00:54:38,382
do you think there would be
in this country

1012
00:54:38,799 --> 00:54:40,384
without wars?

1013
00:54:42,010 --> 00:54:45,137
I'm not saying
that the Civil War

1014
00:54:45,138 --> 00:54:47,807
wasn't fought
for legitimate reasons

1015
00:54:47,808 --> 00:54:51,852
but, if everyone had been
able to go on fucking

1016
00:54:51,853 --> 00:54:55,899
instead of going to war, any war,
anywhere in the world,

1017
00:54:56,608 --> 00:54:59,318
how many people would that leave
on our dying planet?

1018
00:54:59,319 --> 00:55:02,489
Do the arithmetic for me,
for the next time we meet.

1019
00:55:04,616 --> 00:55:09,371
I'm gonna go outside
and get a breath of fresh air.

1020
00:55:10,414 --> 00:55:11,581
Do whatever you want.

1021
00:55:13,125 --> 00:55:16,503
Just,
clean up after yourselves,

1022
00:55:16,711 --> 00:55:19,965
you sad, pathetic, doomed shitheads.

1023
00:55:28,473 --> 00:55:29,641
Sit down, Klein.

1024
00:55:30,600 --> 00:55:33,019
Thank you.
Okay, let's do some math.

1025
00:55:34,271 --> 00:55:36,981
In a group of, say,
a hundred people,

1026
00:55:36,982 --> 00:55:39,401
how many assholes
do you think there are?

1027
00:55:40,235 --> 00:55:41,486
In an average group, say.

1028
00:55:42,362 --> 00:55:44,655
I'm serious,
how many parents

1029
00:55:44,656 --> 00:55:46,657
who humiliate
or deny their children?

1030
00:55:46,658 --> 00:55:49,535
How many morons
with stinking breath

1031
00:55:49,536 --> 00:55:50,745
who refuse to do anything about it?

1032
00:55:51,496 --> 00:55:52,956
How many...

1033
00:55:53,290 --> 00:55:57,002
How many constant whiners,
complainers,

1034
00:55:57,377 --> 00:55:59,712
rapists, embezzlers,

1035
00:55:59,713 --> 00:56:01,256
liars, thieves,

1036
00:56:01,548 --> 00:56:03,841
dirty politicians, cheaters?

1037
00:56:03,842 --> 00:56:06,720
It could be your mother,
could be your brother.

1038
00:56:07,804 --> 00:56:09,473
Could be your mother,
could be your brother.

1039
00:56:10,140 --> 00:56:12,433
You, for example.

1040
00:56:12,434 --> 00:56:15,353
How many of you
would be happy

1041
00:56:15,645 --> 00:56:20,107
if some of your friends
were gone tomorrow?

1042
00:56:20,108 --> 00:56:23,569
You, for example,
how many of you would be happy

1043
00:56:23,570 --> 00:56:26,239
not to see some of
your classmates tomorrow?

1044
00:56:26,865 --> 00:56:29,201
Gone. Dead. Buried.

1045
00:56:29,451 --> 00:56:32,204
Their desks empty.
Show of hands.

1046
00:56:34,539 --> 00:56:36,040
Come on, you don't
have to name names.

1047
00:56:36,041 --> 00:56:37,125
Show of hands.
Klein.

1048
00:56:38,502 --> 00:56:41,587
Exactly.
Now a little closer to home.

1049
00:56:41,588 --> 00:56:43,131
Members of your family.

1050
00:56:43,798 --> 00:56:45,550
The uncle with shitty stories.

1051
00:56:46,426 --> 00:56:48,678
The, the molester.

1052
00:56:49,429 --> 00:56:52,057
Boy, you know about those.

1053
00:56:53,099 --> 00:56:57,394
The, the ugly cousin
who mistreats her dogs.

1054
00:56:57,395 --> 00:56:59,689
The verbally abusive mother.

1055
00:57:01,525 --> 00:57:05,402
Now think how happy
you and your loved ones would be

1056
00:57:05,403 --> 00:57:10,115
if that uncle or adopted cousin
were to step on a land mine

1057
00:57:10,116 --> 00:57:12,410
or get hit by a military strike.

1058
00:57:13,620 --> 00:57:16,081
Just like that.
Wiped off the face of the earth.

1059
00:57:18,124 --> 00:57:19,750
Yeah, that's good.
Just like that.

1060
00:57:19,751 --> 00:57:21,294
Wiped out.

1061
00:57:22,963 --> 00:57:25,506
Just like that.
Just like that.

1062
00:57:25,507 --> 00:57:26,550
Wiped out.

1063
00:57:27,259 --> 00:57:31,428
You'd be happy, right?
You'd, you'd be pleased.

1064
00:57:31,429 --> 00:57:33,807
You'd support the idea of war.

1065
00:57:34,182 --> 00:57:38,270
Because families are oppressive
and unloving and cruel.

1066
00:57:39,145 --> 00:57:40,814
Okay now, stay with me.

1067
00:57:41,106 --> 00:57:42,482
Now imagine...

1068
00:57:43,525 --> 00:57:46,193
Because families are oppressive
and unloving and cruel.

1069
00:57:46,194 --> 00:57:47,362
Okay, stay with me.

1070
00:57:47,529 --> 00:57:50,322
Now think of all the victims
of all the wars

1071
00:57:50,323 --> 00:57:53,325
that have ever been in the past
and,

1072
00:57:53,326 --> 00:57:56,287
and now think of the tens
of thousands of assholes,

1073
00:57:56,288 --> 00:57:59,415
hundreds of thousands,
maybe more, millions,

1074
00:57:59,416 --> 00:58:00,874
that we need around
like a hole in the head.

1075
00:58:00,875 --> 00:58:03,586
Now from a purely
statistical standpoint,

1076
00:58:03,587 --> 00:58:05,296
it's mathematically impossible

1077
00:58:05,297 --> 00:58:09,258
that all the victims of wars were
good people, whatever that means.

1078
00:58:09,259 --> 00:58:11,760
The true injustice of history
is that the assholes

1079
00:58:11,761 --> 00:58:14,346
appear on the lists
of innocent victims.

1080
00:58:14,347 --> 00:58:17,057
Their names are carved
into the memorials

1081
00:58:17,058 --> 00:58:19,476
with the noble and the virtuous
and the good.

1082
00:58:52,510 --> 00:58:56,889
Nausea, constipation,
somnolence, dry mouth,

1083
00:58:56,890 --> 00:58:59,643
dizziness, sweating,
nervousness,

1084
00:59:00,727 --> 00:59:02,395
fast heartbeat, hypertension.

1085
00:59:06,399 --> 00:59:08,026
Sexual dysfunction.

1086
00:59:09,861 --> 00:59:12,613
B-But she said, she said
that she wasn't expecting

1087
00:59:12,614 --> 00:59:14,532
any of these problems at this dosage,
remember?

1088
00:59:18,328 --> 00:59:19,495
Is that all?

1089
00:59:19,496 --> 00:59:22,498
Impaired coordination,
memory impairment,

1090
00:59:22,499 --> 00:59:24,166
short-term memory loss,

1091
00:59:24,167 --> 00:59:27,002
which I guess, memory slips, right?
Or something,

1092
00:59:27,003 --> 00:59:29,839
What... I don't think we should
need to look at this anymore.

1093
00:59:45,897 --> 00:59:48,274
What about personality changes?

1094
00:59:50,068 --> 00:59:51,986
That's not a side effect.

1095
00:59:52,779 --> 00:59:54,239
<i>That's the effect.</i>

1096
01:00:00,453 --> 01:00:01,579
Is that good?

1097
01:00:14,175 --> 01:00:15,885
I guess we're here.

1098
01:00:17,011 --> 01:00:18,513
Glad we're doing this.

1099
01:00:22,058 --> 01:00:24,853
I wouldn't have suggested it
if I didn't want to do it, Paul.

1100
01:00:25,729 --> 01:00:27,731
I thought the shrink suggested it.

1101
01:00:31,943 --> 01:00:33,653
-Shit.
-Take it.

1102
01:00:34,529 --> 01:00:36,280
No, its okay.
I'm gonna turn it off.

1103
01:00:43,329 --> 01:00:45,457
There's no shame
in getting help, Paul.

1104
01:00:46,750 --> 01:00:48,543
There's help in getting shame?

1105
01:00:49,669 --> 01:00:52,589
-Am I causing you shame?
-You're shaming my cause.

1106
01:00:55,008 --> 01:00:57,468
Are you just gonna flip
every sentence I say. Is that it?

1107
01:00:57,469 --> 01:00:59,471
I'm just gonna say
every sentence you flip.

1108
01:00:59,888 --> 01:01:01,097
Jesus.

1109
01:01:01,514 --> 01:01:02,681
Susej.

1110
01:01:06,269 --> 01:01:08,104
Susej.
You're good. You're good.

1111
01:01:08,938 --> 01:01:11,357
You're good.
You're a knucklehead, but you're good.

1112
01:01:12,233 --> 01:01:16,069
<i>Pennsylvania Avenue
at the Walnut Street Bridge</i>

1113
01:01:16,070 --> 01:01:17,572
<i>in downtown Gettysburg.</i>

1114
01:01:17,989 --> 01:01:21,033
<i>The event is open to the public.
It will be held rain or shine.</i>

1115
01:01:21,034 --> 01:01:24,703
<i>Preservation Pennsylvania
will be back on Sunday...</i>

1116
01:01:39,052 --> 01:01:41,054
Come on.
Have you seen these?

1117
01:01:42,305 --> 01:01:43,973
You sure you want to go in?

1118
01:01:45,517 --> 01:01:46,726
Yeah.

1119
01:01:54,359 --> 01:01:56,236
<i>You are on hallowed ground.</i>

1120
01:01:56,653 --> 01:02:00,365
<i>The exact place where events changed
the course of American history.</i>

1121
01:02:01,115 --> 01:02:03,784
<i>Though it is the bloodiest place
in America'</i>

1122
01:02:03,785 --> 01:02:07,330
<i>there is a deep peace to be found
here at Gettysburg.</i>

1123
01:02:07,747 --> 01:02:11,543
<i>If you let it,
this land will speak to you.</i>

1124
01:02:12,252 --> 01:02:14,754
<i>Now, let's go.</i>

1125
01:02:15,004 --> 01:02:16,797
<i>Please pay attention for this sound.</i>

1126
01:02:21,761 --> 01:02:24,263
<i>Well, I wish I was in
the land of cotton...</i>

1127
01:02:24,264 --> 01:02:26,474
<i>As the sun rises
behind the clouds of July 1st,</i>

1128
01:02:26,808 --> 01:02:31,019
<i>wisps of mist partially obscure
the figures of Confederate soldiers</i>

1129
01:02:31,020 --> 01:02:33,272
<i>as they make their way
across Marsh Creek.</i>

1130
01:02:33,273 --> 01:02:37,693
<i>At 7:30 a.m., Union Lieutenant
Marcellus Jones of Illinois</i>

1131
01:02:37,694 --> 01:02:40,572
<i>borrows a soldier's carbine rifle
and says,</i>

1132
01:02:41,281 --> 01:02:43,825
<i>"Let me have the honor
of opening the ball."</i>

1133
01:02:44,367 --> 01:02:46,785
<i>He rests the rifle
across a fence rail,</i>

1134
01:02:46,786 --> 01:02:50,164
<i>a column of rebel infantry
crosses Marsh Creek.</i>

1135
01:02:50,957 --> 01:02:51,832
<i>He fires...</i>

1136
01:02:53,084 --> 01:02:54,209
<i>the first shot</i>

1137
01:02:54,210 --> 01:02:57,630
<i>of the greatest battle ever fought
in the Western Hemisphere.</i>

1138
01:02:58,506 --> 01:03:00,258
<i>Gettysburg begins.</i>

1139
01:03:00,967 --> 01:03:04,177
<i>From mid-morning
until mid-afternoon on July 1st,</i>

1140
01:03:04,178 --> 01:03:08,056
<i>these woods would see some of
the most intense fighting of the battle.</i>

1141
01:03:08,057 --> 01:03:11,978
<i>For both armies, it is now
a race to the battlefield.</i>

1142
01:03:12,312 --> 01:03:15,606
<i>Rebel reinforcements arrive
along the Harrisburg Road</i>

1143
01:03:15,607 --> 01:03:19,151
<i>and smash the Union right flank
at Barlow's Knoll.</i>

1144
01:03:19,152 --> 01:03:23,031
<i>In less than 20 minutes' these
Yankees are retreating in disorder.</i>

1145
01:03:23,364 --> 01:03:26,742
<i>And soon, the entire Federal position
is forced to retreat.</i>

1146
01:03:28,995 --> 01:03:30,412
<i>In about a mile,</i>

1147
01:03:30,413 --> 01:03:32,998
<i>you will pass the site
of General Lee's headquarters.</i>

1148
01:03:32,999 --> 01:03:36,127
<i>As the Union forces retreat
through the fields of Gettysburg,</i>

1149
01:03:36,669 --> 01:03:41,174
<i>towns and streets turn into a chaotic
and vicious, bloody battlefield.</i>

1150
01:03:41,424 --> 01:03:44,092
<i>From Seminary Ridge
located to our west,</i>

1151
01:03:44,093 --> 01:03:46,554
<i>The Black Hats Brigade
explodes from the woods</i>

1152
01:03:46,804 --> 01:03:50,724
<i>with the general riding 50 yards
in front of his 1,400 men.</i>

1153
01:03:50,725 --> 01:03:54,019
<i>The Mississippi was crashing
through the right side...</i>

1154
01:03:55,563 --> 01:03:58,608
<i>The Union flank explodes
like ripe fruit.</i>

1155
01:04:00,401 --> 01:04:03,112
<i>There is little protection
of this exposed flank.</i>

1156
01:04:03,613 --> 01:04:05,864
<i>Men take cover
as best as they can.</i>

1157
01:04:06,991 --> 01:04:07,950
<i>Please pause the audio</i>

1158
01:04:07,951 --> 01:04:10,203
<i>until you reach
"stop gate" further left.</i>

1159
01:04:10,578 --> 01:04:12,579
<i>From the heights
of Little Round Top and...</i>

1160
01:04:12,580 --> 01:04:14,289
Paul!
Come on, let's keep going.

1161
01:04:14,290 --> 01:04:16,375
<i>From the heights
of Little Round Top</i>

1162
01:04:16,376 --> 01:04:19,252
<i>and Cemetery Hill,
units fire</i>

1163
01:04:19,253 --> 01:04:21,463
<i>into the sides of the Rebel lines,</i>

1164
01:04:21,464 --> 01:04:23,257
<i>tearing through scores of men.</i>

1165
01:04:30,348 --> 01:04:33,767
<i>No, the Union troops surge back
pushing against the Rebels'</i>

1166
01:04:33,768 --> 01:04:37,229
<i>dwindling their numbers
as they fall.</i>

1167
01:04:37,230 --> 01:04:40,315
<i>New reinforcements
swarm over the ridge.</i>

1168
01:04:40,316 --> 01:04:44,695
<i>The few men who break the Union line
are killed, wounded or captured.</i>

1169
01:04:44,696 --> 01:04:47,948
<i>It is known as the high-water mark
of the Confederacy.</i>

1170
01:04:47,949 --> 01:04:53,036
<i>Never again will Confederacy come
so close to winning the Civil War</i>

1171
01:04:53,037 --> 01:04:55,163
<i>as they do here at this moment</i>

1172
01:04:55,164 --> 01:05:00,128
<i>on this day, July 3rd, 1803,
Gettysburg.</i>

1173
01:05:14,726 --> 01:05:17,061
This is too much,
I don't know. Sorry.

1174
01:05:21,399 --> 01:05:22,774
Almost as many here
as the whole Vietnam war.

1175
01:05:22,775 --> 01:05:24,944
You realize that? 50,000?

1176
01:05:25,778 --> 01:05:28,905
What are you talking about?
Millions of people died in Vietnam.

1177
01:05:28,906 --> 01:05:31,074
I'm talking about Americans.
You know what I'm talking about.

1178
01:05:31,075 --> 01:05:31,909
Give me a break.

1179
01:05:33,786 --> 01:05:35,163
I don't see you crying.

1180
01:05:38,499 --> 01:05:40,667
People express emotions
in different ways, Paul.

1181
01:05:40,668 --> 01:05:42,420
You know that.
Doesn't mean I don't have any.

1182
01:05:46,591 --> 01:05:48,341
You're saying I'm weak?

1183
01:05:48,342 --> 01:05:50,970
I'm not saying you're weak.
I'm saying...

1184
01:05:52,680 --> 01:05:56,099
I'm saying that you are who you are
and I accept that.

1185
01:05:56,100 --> 01:05:57,685
I accept you.
I always accept you.

1186
01:05:59,479 --> 01:06:01,397
We're different people,
so what? Big deal.

1187
01:06:03,066 --> 01:06:05,568
I will always accept you.
Come on.

1188
01:06:06,360 --> 01:06:07,778
What are you trying to say?

1189
01:06:12,366 --> 01:06:13,534
What are you saying?

1190
01:06:15,703 --> 01:06:19,206
We have had a history of mental illness
in this family for generations

1191
01:06:19,207 --> 01:06:20,458
so maybe it's...

1192
01:06:21,250 --> 01:06:23,586
it's time for us to actually
do something about it.

1193
01:06:24,545 --> 01:06:25,713
We need to deal with it.

1194
01:06:28,883 --> 01:06:30,675
-What are you saying?
-I'm saying Mom was a wacko.

1195
01:06:30,676 --> 01:06:34,596
That's what I'm saying.!

1196
01:06:34,597 --> 01:06:37,183
And Dad, where was he?
The guy checked out. It was...

1197
01:06:37,642 --> 01:06:39,727
We had each other.
It was you and me.

1198
01:06:40,645 --> 01:06:41,813
You remember?

1199
01:06:42,605 --> 01:06:44,524
And I always looked out for you.

1200
01:06:49,070 --> 01:06:51,364
-I still don't see you crying.
-Come on.

1201
01:06:54,867 --> 01:06:59,162
You always thought
that I had it easier than you,

1202
01:06:59,163 --> 01:07:02,290
that I had the run of the house,
Mom liked me better. All of that.

1203
01:07:02,291 --> 01:07:03,751
This is all bullshit.

1204
01:07:04,585 --> 01:07:08,256
Someone had to be the adult in the
house and it wasn't going to be Mom.

1205
01:07:09,757 --> 01:07:11,884
I didn't ask for the job, okay?

1206
01:07:12,677 --> 01:07:14,761
Yeah, I can see
you're all broken up about it.

1207
01:07:14,762 --> 01:07:16,638
Come on. Paul, stay here.

1208
01:07:16,639 --> 01:07:19,058
I wanna talk.
We're talking. Please.

1209
01:07:19,892 --> 01:07:20,893
Fuck you.

1210
01:07:22,520 --> 01:07:23,729
Don't be a baby.

1211
01:07:24,438 --> 01:07:25,273
Fuck you!

1212
01:07:26,315 --> 01:07:28,150
Ay-yi-yi-yi.

1213
01:08:19,702 --> 01:08:22,413
It doesn't matter what we teach,
we learn nothing.

1214
01:08:23,164 --> 01:08:25,416
I've done nothing with my life.

1215
01:08:26,709 --> 01:08:28,460
He destroyed me.

1216
01:08:28,461 --> 01:08:31,964
<i>Bullshit.
He took time off to be with you.</i>

1217
01:08:32,757 --> 01:08:35,133
<i>Paul, he's a busy man.
He cares about you.</i>

1218
01:08:35,134 --> 01:08:40,889
Yeah, well,
only one side wins in a war.

1219
01:08:40,890 --> 01:08:43,517
<i>No' no' no.
Listen, come on, Paul.</i>

1220
01:08:44,227 --> 01:08:45,311
<i>He's your brother.</i>

1221
01:08:46,687 --> 01:08:48,731
<i>You got to tell me
what's going on.</i>

1222
01:08:49,690 --> 01:08:50,982
I'm okay.

1223
01:08:50,983 --> 01:08:53,611
I'm okay. I'm okay.
I'm just...

1224
01:08:54,612 --> 01:08:56,655
I've been thinking
I'm not gonna write the book.

1225
01:08:56,656 --> 01:09:00,785
There's, you know, we know
too much about the Civil War.

1226
01:09:02,370 --> 01:09:04,330
It's time to un-know it.

1227
01:09:05,790 --> 01:09:07,792
<i>Did you take your pills?</i>

1228
01:09:10,044 --> 01:09:11,127
Yes.

1229
01:09:11,128 --> 01:09:13,798
<i>Okay' thank you.
Did you have dinner last night?</i>

1230
01:09:15,466 --> 01:09:16,508
I wasn't hungry.

1231
01:09:16,509 --> 01:09:18,593
Stan ordered something to his room.

1232
01:09:18,594 --> 01:09:19,804
<i>Paul, you ready?</i>

1233
01:09:20,012 --> 01:09:20,972
How's Mike?

1234
01:09:21,472 --> 01:09:24,891
<i>' he's good. He's good.
Do you want to talk to him?</i>

1235
01:09:24,892 --> 01:09:26,893
<i>-Paul.
-I'll get Michael. Feel better.</i>

1236
01:09:26,894 --> 01:09:28,561
<i>Okay? So hang on
one second. I'll get him.</i>

1237
01:09:28,562 --> 01:09:29,729
No, no. No, no.

1238
01:09:32,066 --> 01:09:33,818
<i>Paul?</i>

1239
01:09:37,363 --> 01:09:39,656
<i>Come on. I know you're there.</i>

1240
01:09:39,657 --> 01:09:40,532
<i>Hey, Paul?</i>

1241
01:09:40,533 --> 01:09:43,369
<i>-Let's go.
-Hey, Paul?</i>

1242
01:09:45,121 --> 01:09:47,247
<i>Paul, are you there?</i>

1243
01:09:47,248 --> 01:09:49,249
<i>-Come on. Come on.
-Hey, Paul?</i>

1244
01:09:49,250 --> 01:09:50,918
<i>Let's go' Paul.
We gotta go now. Come on.</i>

1245
01:09:52,169 --> 01:09:55,213
<i>Paul, please pick up the phone.</i>

1246
01:09:55,214 --> 01:09:58,300
<i>Paul?</i>

1247
01:09:58,301 --> 01:10:01,012
<i>-Open the door. Now!
-All right.</i>

1248
01:10:02,388 --> 01:10:04,515
All right, I'm coming, I'm coming.

1249
01:10:06,475 --> 01:10:08,310
-Hey.
-God.

1250
01:10:08,311 --> 01:10:10,771
-I'm sorry.
-What did you do?

1251
01:10:13,441 --> 01:10:15,984
-What... Do you have a key?
-I'm gonna go get some ice.

1252
01:10:15,985 --> 01:10:17,695
-What did you do?
-Punched the mirror.

1253
01:10:18,529 --> 01:10:19,530
Paul. Paul.

1254
01:10:20,239 --> 01:10:21,990
Please stop me if you've
heard this one before

1255
01:10:21,991 --> 01:10:24,242
but I am a cheese fanatic.

1256
01:10:24,243 --> 01:10:26,286
Seriously, I can talk
about this for hours.

1257
01:10:26,287 --> 01:10:28,663
Literally, I could tell you
the names of the cows.

1258
01:10:28,664 --> 01:10:31,292
You seem like very nice people
so I don't want to bombard you.

1259
01:10:31,834 --> 01:10:33,002
Unless you ask me to.

1260
01:10:33,294 --> 01:10:36,254
So, very quickly starting by region,

1261
01:10:36,255 --> 01:10:38,209
from Vermont, this
is a Harbison cheese.

1262
01:10:38,210 --> 01:10:39,591
This is a very gooey cheese.

1263
01:10:39,592 --> 01:10:42,052
If you cut it in half,
it will spill out.

1264
01:10:42,053 --> 01:10:44,346
So you need to make
an incision on the top rind

1265
01:10:44,347 --> 01:10:46,765
and eat it with a spoon
or with a fork.

1266
01:10:46,766 --> 01:10:50,185
Also from Vermont,
we have the Bayley Hazen Blue cheese.

1267
01:10:50,186 --> 01:10:51,728
It's a very flavorful blue cheese.

1268
01:10:51,729 --> 01:10:53,104
Personal favorite of mine.

1269
01:10:53,105 --> 01:10:56,024
From New York state,
the Hudson Flower.

1270
01:10:56,025 --> 01:10:58,777
The Hudson Flower
is a riff, if you will,

1271
01:10:58,778 --> 01:11:02,656
on the Corsican classic,
Fleur du Maquis.

1272
01:11:02,948 --> 01:11:04,074
Hudson Flower.

1273
01:11:04,075 --> 01:11:08,244
In the middle, the centerpiece is,
the Mimolette from France.

1274
01:11:08,245 --> 01:11:10,330
The infamous Mimolette,

1275
01:11:10,331 --> 01:11:11,831
the controversial Mimolette.

1276
01:11:11,832 --> 01:11:12,957
You may have heard of this cheese.

1277
01:11:12,958 --> 01:11:14,626
The FDA tried to ban it.

1278
01:11:14,627 --> 01:11:16,169
We have it here for you today.
Mimolette.

1279
01:11:16,170 --> 01:11:18,838
And finally, this is a tricky one.

1280
01:11:18,839 --> 01:11:22,092
It's a German name
but it comes from Italy.

1281
01:11:22,093 --> 01:11:25,053
So, insert joke about fascism here.

1282
01:11:25,054 --> 01:11:28,014
Weinkase Lagrein.

1283
01:11:28,015 --> 01:11:30,934
Weinkase translates literally
into "wine cheese"

1284
01:11:30,935 --> 01:11:34,437
and Lagrein is the red gr...
The red wine grape variety

1285
01:11:34,438 --> 01:11:36,440
that is found in the valleys
of Northern Italy.

1286
01:11:36,816 --> 01:11:39,484
So there you go.
Any questions.

1287
01:11:39,485 --> 01:11:42,695
Don't move.
Let's just stay put from now on.

1288
01:11:42,696 --> 01:11:44,030
Nobody leaves the table.

1289
01:11:44,031 --> 01:11:45,824
Not even to go to the bathroom?

1290
01:11:45,825 --> 01:11:48,827
-Yes, Paul.
-What is this? EST? Scientology?

1291
01:11:48,828 --> 01:11:52,038
You know what I mean.
We really need to talk

1292
01:11:52,039 --> 01:11:55,918
and th-there's no reason why
we can't talk about anything here

1293
01:11:56,168 --> 01:11:58,044
discreetly, pointedly.

1294
01:11:58,045 --> 01:12:00,255
-I think that window has closed.
-No, Paul.

1295
01:12:00,256 --> 01:12:01,297
-Paul, let him.
-I don't want to talk.

1296
01:12:01,298 --> 01:12:02,716
Please, dear.

1297
01:12:02,883 --> 01:12:05,553
We're gonna put the truth
right here in front of us,

1298
01:12:06,053 --> 01:12:08,263
and we're gonna do
something about it. Okay?

1299
01:12:08,264 --> 01:12:09,765
And, Paul, if you could
just get out of your head for a minute.

1300
01:12:10,015 --> 01:12:11,975
Me? What about you, Scarf ace?

1301
01:12:11,976 --> 01:12:14,102
-Please don't go there.
-You should have closed that door.

1302
01:12:14,103 --> 01:12:15,186
-Enough of that.
-Wait, wait.

1303
01:12:15,187 --> 01:12:17,355
What happened to "we should
be able to talk about anything"?

1304
01:12:17,356 --> 01:12:19,357
I don't think we need
to turn this into...

1305
01:12:19,358 --> 01:12:22,152
-Unbelievable I thought...
-No, no, no...

1306
01:12:22,153 --> 01:12:23,862
You're just trying to protect yourself.

1307
01:12:23,863 --> 01:12:26,490
I have been...
Forgiving you is all I've been doing.

1308
01:12:26,657 --> 01:12:28,992
Keep your voices down
and, Stan, come on.

1309
01:12:28,993 --> 01:12:31,286
You think that forgiveness
is the same as absolution.

1310
01:12:31,287 --> 01:12:33,163
You should have closed
that door, you ape.

1311
01:12:33,164 --> 01:12:35,915
Stan, just go on. Go on.

1312
01:12:35,916 --> 01:12:37,792
Stan wants to talk about the truth.

1313
01:12:37,793 --> 01:12:39,294
It's not about the truth,
it's about the boys.

1314
01:12:39,295 --> 01:12:41,254
Let Stan say what he has to say.

1315
01:12:41,255 --> 01:12:43,131
We don't have to agree with him,

1316
01:12:43,132 --> 01:12:45,800
-but we can have a civil discussion.
-I want to...

1317
01:12:45,801 --> 01:12:47,594
-Please, just give him a chance.
-Give him a chance.

1318
01:12:47,595 --> 01:12:49,554
Okay, I want to know what
the truth is to a politician.

1319
01:12:49,555 --> 01:12:52,265
I want to know what the truth
is to a child

1320
01:12:52,266 --> 01:12:54,684
-who made his parents ignore his brother.
-Don't do it.

1321
01:12:54,685 --> 01:12:58,062
You don't know half of it, Kate.
You're late to this party.

1322
01:12:58,063 --> 01:12:59,731
Okay, Paul, stop. Enough.

1323
01:12:59,732 --> 01:13:02,025
You're being incredibly
disrespectful to everyone.

1324
01:13:02,026 --> 01:13:05,445
-Now you're turning against me?
-I think everyone should just calm down.

1325
01:13:05,446 --> 01:13:09,033
Claire, is that...
Now, of all the rotten times, is...

1326
01:13:09,575 --> 01:13:10,909
You've always been against me?

1327
01:13:10,910 --> 01:13:15,705
Why don't you just say what is inside
that small head of yours?

1328
01:13:15,706 --> 01:13:19,293
-What is this Parity bill?
-I don't know what you're talking about.

1329
01:13:19,502 --> 01:13:21,544
This bill you've been working on.
What is it?

1330
01:13:21,545 --> 01:13:23,004
What does it have to do
with anything, this bill?

1331
01:13:23,005 --> 01:13:25,298
-Tell me.
-Last year you told me it was boring.

1332
01:13:25,299 --> 01:13:26,382
-No. No, no.
-You felt it was boring.

1333
01:13:26,383 --> 01:13:28,385
Last year I told you,
you were boring.

1334
01:13:31,096 --> 01:13:32,347
You want me to tell you about it?

1335
01:13:32,348 --> 01:13:33,723
Are you really interested in it?
You want to know?

1336
01:13:33,724 --> 01:13:35,518
-Sure.
-Jesus fucking Christ.

1337
01:13:38,687 --> 01:13:43,943
The Mental Health Parity Act,
MHPAA.

1338
01:13:45,653 --> 01:13:48,947
It's about closing loopholes
in the Affordable Care Act.

1339
01:13:48,948 --> 01:13:54,327
It requires that medical insurers
offer mental health options,

1340
01:13:54,328 --> 01:13:58,706
insuring that mental health
treatment is reimbursed

1341
01:13:58,707 --> 01:14:01,751
at levels exactly the same
as physical.

1342
01:14:01,752 --> 01:14:06,214
Ultimately, all this is about
is destigmatizing mental illness.

1343
01:14:06,215 --> 01:14:07,090
So, it's about... it's about me.

1344
01:14:07,091 --> 01:14:08,591
What is it about you?

1345
01:14:08,592 --> 01:14:09,926
-What does it have to do with you?
-Come on, Paul, really.

1346
01:14:09,927 --> 01:14:13,012
"Fuck you, Paul" bill.
"Fuck you, Paul" as federal law.

1347
01:14:13,013 --> 01:14:16,349
Look, this is about getting
real treatment for people who need it.

1348
01:14:16,350 --> 01:14:18,601
This was... It was Kate's issue,
long before me.

1349
01:14:18,602 --> 01:14:22,313
Every, every family, has someone
who suffers from mental illness.

1350
01:14:22,314 --> 01:14:24,399
"Every family has someone
who suffers from mental illness."

1351
01:14:24,400 --> 01:14:25,858
-Yes, exactly.
-"It's time to break the silence"...

1352
01:14:25,859 --> 01:14:29,112
I've heard these speeches before, Kate.
You know, it's...

1353
01:14:29,113 --> 01:14:31,573
Do you enjoy doing this to me
every single time

1354
01:14:31,574 --> 01:14:33,408
when you expose me?
Is that your intention?

1355
01:14:33,409 --> 01:14:35,159
I'm not gonna sit here
and take this from you, Paul.

1356
01:14:35,160 --> 01:14:37,620
-You're acting like a child.
-You're just like him.

1357
01:14:37,621 --> 01:14:39,414
-Barbara cared about me.
-And I would appreciate it if you...

1358
01:14:39,415 --> 01:14:41,583
-Barbara tried to make amends.
-Acted like an adult

1359
01:14:41,584 --> 01:14:42,917
-and showed some class.
-You don't have to defend or protect

1360
01:14:42,918 --> 01:14:45,545
your husband every time
I say something.

1361
01:14:45,546 --> 01:14:47,797
-It's true.
-I am trying to protect you, dear.

1362
01:14:47,798 --> 01:14:50,384
So shut the fuck up and don't you
dare talk to me like that.

1363
01:14:50,634 --> 01:14:52,427
I don't know why you think
that attacking me

1364
01:14:52,428 --> 01:14:54,679
is going to stall this conversation
because it's not.

1365
01:14:54,680 --> 01:14:57,932
Want to turn me into your hall monitor
for tonight? Fine.

1366
01:14:57,933 --> 01:15:01,812
Pipe down and listen...
you ape.

1367
01:15:03,814 --> 01:15:05,357
Wow.

1368
01:15:07,901 --> 01:15:09,819
Sorry, Congressman,
I need you for a minute.

1369
01:15:09,820 --> 01:15:11,654
-It's really urgent.
-Are you sure?

1370
01:15:11,655 --> 01:15:13,157
Five minutes. No more.

1371
01:15:14,700 --> 01:15:15,701
Five minutes.

1372
01:15:16,285 --> 01:15:18,203
Nobody else moves, okay?

1373
01:15:57,576 --> 01:16:00,454
<i>What the fuck?
Makes no fucking sense.</i>

1374
01:16:01,163 --> 01:16:04,457
<i>-' no' no.
-No, no, no...</i>

1375
01:16:04,458 --> 01:16:07,461
<i>Let's go. Come on, Rick.
Let's go.</i>

1376
01:16:14,051 --> 01:16:16,594
-Hey.
-Porn in the kitchen?

1377
01:16:16,595 --> 01:16:18,555
Just listening to music.

1378
01:16:20,182 --> 01:16:22,976
-How are you?
-Good. Great. Fine.

1379
01:16:23,936 --> 01:16:25,396
That's three different answers.

1380
01:16:25,688 --> 01:16:27,064
Pick one. Any one.

1381
01:16:29,274 --> 01:16:31,402
You would not believe the day I've had.

1382
01:16:34,613 --> 01:16:36,073
Would you come
back to the table?

1383
01:16:36,240 --> 01:16:37,449
I think we should leave.

1384
01:16:38,158 --> 01:16:40,702
No.
Everything's fine.

1385
01:16:40,703 --> 01:16:42,453
-Everything's going to be okay.
-Hey, hey.

1386
01:16:42,454 --> 01:16:44,330
-Just don't overreact. Okay?
-How is it fine?

1387
01:16:44,331 --> 01:16:45,498
We can't talk about the truth.

1388
01:16:45,499 --> 01:16:48,251
The truth is their son's gonna rat out
our son and his own brother.

1389
01:16:48,252 --> 01:16:50,044
He's getting his money.
He's gonna get his money tonight.

1390
01:16:50,045 --> 01:16:52,255
I've taken care of everything.
Now, please do not overreact.

1391
01:16:52,256 --> 01:16:53,715
It's my job to take care of things.

1392
01:16:53,716 --> 01:16:55,508
-My job. I'm the father.
-I'm sorry.

1393
01:16:55,509 --> 01:16:57,886
-It's my job to take care.
-I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1394
01:16:58,137 --> 01:17:00,304
You know, a house
divided against itself

1395
01:17:00,305 --> 01:17:02,432
-cannot stand.
-Do not quote at me right now.

1396
01:17:02,433 --> 01:17:05,686
Do not quote at me right now.
Don't. Take a deep breath.

1397
01:17:09,189 --> 01:17:11,107
-What the fuck were those
fucking kids thinking?

1398
01:17:11,108 --> 01:17:12,817
I don't know. I wish I knew.

1399
01:17:12,818 --> 01:17:14,695
But that doesn't matter now.

1400
01:17:15,487 --> 01:17:18,197
They are good kids
and they took a wrong turn.

1401
01:17:18,198 --> 01:17:19,574
And we're gonna get them
back on track

1402
01:17:19,575 --> 01:17:21,493
and they're gonna move on
with their lives.

1403
01:17:22,786 --> 01:17:24,538
Can we go home now?

1404
01:17:25,831 --> 01:17:27,374
We need to hear them out.

1405
01:17:28,167 --> 01:17:30,002
Your brother,
he can be very practical.

1406
01:17:31,211 --> 01:17:32,421
He's a deal-maker.

1407
01:17:33,380 --> 01:17:36,550
Okay? So, don't antagonize him.

1408
01:17:37,885 --> 01:17:39,344
And lay off Kate.

1409
01:17:40,179 --> 01:17:41,638
Because we need them both.

1410
01:17:42,723 --> 01:17:44,349
I don't want you to get sick again.

1411
01:17:46,769 --> 01:17:48,729
But I'm... I'm perfectly fine.

1412
01:17:50,189 --> 01:17:51,523
Don't leave me ever again.

1413
01:17:52,608 --> 01:17:54,692
-Please don't die.
-Stop talking like that.

1414
01:17:54,693 --> 01:17:57,988
-Stop. Stop talking like I'm not here.
-I...

1415
01:17:58,864 --> 01:18:00,990
-I'm right here.
-Should've closed that door.

1416
01:18:00,991 --> 01:18:05,203
I-I-I asked him, very calmly,

1417
01:18:05,204 --> 01:18:07,748
-I told him to close the door.
-I know. I know. I know.

1418
01:18:09,041 --> 01:18:12,127
-And Michael was just standing there.
-I know. I know.

1419
01:18:15,130 --> 01:18:16,256
I know.

1420
01:18:48,705 --> 01:18:50,040
Boy.

1421
01:18:54,294 --> 01:18:55,504
Shit.

1422
01:18:56,672 --> 01:18:57,714
Hey.

1423
01:19:03,595 --> 01:19:05,305
-Hey, brother.
-Hey.

1424
01:19:06,139 --> 01:19:07,266
What are you doing here?

1425
01:19:08,517 --> 01:19:11,270
We just went by to see Claire
and wish her luck tomorrow.

1426
01:19:12,271 --> 01:19:14,398
-Right. Thank you.
-You're gonna invite us in?

1427
01:19:24,157 --> 01:19:28,160
-How are you doing, Paul?
-You should really have called first.

1428
01:19:28,161 --> 01:19:31,163
I'm sorry. We didn't think
that it was necessary.

1429
01:19:31,164 --> 01:19:32,540
-Yeah.
-All right just to come over?

1430
01:19:32,541 --> 01:19:33,791
How're you doing?
How're you doing?

1431
01:19:33,792 --> 01:19:37,671
Yeah, I was about to call
Mike for his lunch.

1432
01:19:38,797 --> 01:19:41,632
I try to make every meal
a celebration.

1433
01:19:41,633 --> 01:19:43,885
-Take his mind off things.
-Yeah.

1434
01:19:43,886 --> 01:19:45,803
Mikey, we have guests!

1435
01:19:46,972 --> 01:19:48,015
Is he okay?

1436
01:19:50,309 --> 01:19:53,437
-How's he doing?
-He's doing okay. I'll go find him.

1437
01:19:56,273 --> 01:19:57,691
Mikey!

1438
01:19:58,066 --> 01:19:59,984
Mikey, your uncle is here.

1439
01:19:59,985 --> 01:20:01,695
And his aunt.

1440
01:20:02,112 --> 01:20:03,404
And your aunt.

1441
01:20:03,405 --> 01:20:06,073
-Hey, bud.
-There he is.

1442
01:20:06,074 --> 01:20:09,493
-Hey, kiddo.
-Hey, beautiful boy.

1443
01:20:09,494 --> 01:20:14,206
Look at you. Look at you. Man.
We just came by to say hello.

1444
01:20:14,207 --> 01:20:15,207
Still in your PJs?

1445
01:20:15,208 --> 01:20:18,085
Daddy gave me
ice cream before lunch.

1446
01:20:18,086 --> 01:20:19,211
-He did?
-Did he?

1447
01:20:19,212 --> 01:20:20,171
Yeah.

1448
01:20:20,172 --> 01:20:22,507
Sometimes ice cream makes
everything better, a lot better.

1449
01:20:22,841 --> 01:20:25,009
Come by tomorrow,
you can eat it off the floor.

1450
01:20:25,010 --> 01:20:25,927
-What's going on?
-Michael,

1451
01:20:25,928 --> 01:20:26,802
why don't you go upstairs
for a minute...

1452
01:20:26,803 --> 01:20:29,348
Exactly. More important things
to think about than...

1453
01:20:30,057 --> 01:20:31,891
We just want to talk to your dad
for a second. Okay, babe?

1454
01:20:31,892 --> 01:20:33,267
Hey, but just a minute, okay, partner?

1455
01:20:33,268 --> 01:20:35,394
I just... We really should eat

1456
01:20:35,395 --> 01:20:39,482
and then we were gonna start
cleaning your room like you said.

1457
01:20:39,483 --> 01:20:41,108
-Okay. See you in a little bit.
-I'll see you in a minute.

1458
01:20:41,109 --> 01:20:42,986
Okay? All righty?

1459
01:20:49,201 --> 01:20:52,036
Okay. Listen here, Paul.
We've been thinking.

1460
01:20:52,037 --> 01:20:53,245
We have an idea.

1461
01:20:53,246 --> 01:20:56,123
Well, I can't take credit for it,
but I fully endorse it.

1462
01:20:56,124 --> 01:20:58,834
-We would like...
-Paul, we know hard it's been for you.

1463
01:20:58,835 --> 01:21:00,503
-We would like...
-With Claire in the hospital...

1464
01:21:00,504 --> 01:21:03,048
Will you let me talk, please?
Will you just let me talk?

1465
01:21:05,425 --> 01:21:07,761
-Go ahead.
-Thank you. You're an angel.

1466
01:21:08,762 --> 01:21:11,305
Barbara and I think
it might be best for Michael

1467
01:21:11,306 --> 01:21:13,016
if he comes to stay with us
for a while.

1468
01:21:15,811 --> 01:21:19,606
Paul, let's get a maid in here,
and get you back on your feet.

1469
01:21:19,815 --> 01:21:21,774
Michael needs to start
going back to school.

1470
01:21:21,775 --> 01:21:23,317
And you need to start
visiting Claire again.

1471
01:21:26,238 --> 01:21:28,364
We understand
what you're going through.

1472
01:21:28,365 --> 01:21:30,241
I mean, look, we're just here to help.

1473
01:21:30,242 --> 01:21:31,201
-Okay?
-Maybe... yeah.

1474
01:21:31,785 --> 01:21:34,662
It could give you a little space,
you could relax, take care of yourself.

1475
01:21:34,663 --> 01:21:37,707
You know, I think it makes perfect sense.
We've got that extra room.

1476
01:21:37,708 --> 01:21:40,543
I think, really, Paul, I think
it would be the best thing for us.

1477
01:21:40,544 --> 01:21:42,796
For Michael.
It might be a break for Michael.

1478
01:21:43,338 --> 01:21:47,050
He puts on a brave face,
but children need a stable home.

1479
01:21:49,094 --> 01:21:51,513
Hey, listen.

1480
01:21:52,764 --> 01:21:53,849
Listen, Paul.

1481
01:21:55,058 --> 01:21:56,892
My son and I were about
to sit down to eat.

1482
01:21:56,893 --> 01:22:00,104
There's not enough food
to ask you to stay, but...

1483
01:22:00,105 --> 01:22:03,108
-We had lunch already.
-We didn't come here to eat.

1484
01:22:04,109 --> 01:22:07,570
Listen, we just thought
with the operation tomorrow and all,

1485
01:22:07,571 --> 01:22:10,656
it would be best for Michael to come
and stay with us for a while.

1486
01:22:10,657 --> 01:22:13,325
-Work with us. Come on.
-I think you should leave.

1487
01:22:13,326 --> 01:22:15,495
We can't leave you here like this.

1488
01:22:15,912 --> 01:22:18,122
Come on, man.
This is... This is insane.

1489
01:22:18,123 --> 01:22:19,999
-Look at the place. Look around.
-Stan. Stan.

1490
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:21,542
-Look at this place.
-Stan, calm...

1491
01:22:21,543 --> 01:22:22,668
Come on!

1492
01:22:22,669 --> 01:22:24,545
-Take it easy.
-Wake up. Look at me.

1493
01:22:24,546 --> 01:22:25,755
Be quiet!

1494
01:22:25,756 --> 01:22:27,799
Look at me. Come on.

1495
01:22:28,967 --> 01:22:32,012
Come on. For Michael.

1496
01:22:32,846 --> 01:22:33,972
And for Claire.

1497
01:22:37,350 --> 01:22:38,935
Please, Paul.

1498
01:22:40,353 --> 01:22:42,229
I'll help you. I'll help you.
We'll all help you.

1499
01:22:42,230 --> 01:22:43,647
We'll help you clean up the place.

1500
01:22:43,648 --> 01:22:45,566
Seriously, Paul.
I'm sure even you realize

1501
01:22:45,567 --> 01:22:47,944
this is not a good situation for a kid.

1502
01:22:48,945 --> 01:22:50,863
He should be talking to someone,

1503
01:22:50,864 --> 01:22:51,739
dealing with his feelings,

1504
01:22:51,740 --> 01:22:52,782
-and so should you.
-Excuse me?

1505
01:22:52,783 --> 01:22:55,993
Stan is only trying to say that this
can all be a bit too much for you, Paul.

1506
01:22:55,994 --> 01:22:57,203
-Yes.
-We know you're trying

1507
01:22:57,204 --> 01:22:58,954
to keep things as normal
as possible for Mike,

1508
01:22:58,955 --> 01:23:00,623
but this is anything but normal.

1509
01:23:00,624 --> 01:23:01,917
I really think you should leave.

1510
01:23:06,004 --> 01:23:08,924
His mother is ill.
He needs strength.

1511
01:23:09,591 --> 01:23:13,220
He shouldn't feel that his father
can't deal with life anymore.

1512
01:23:13,929 --> 01:23:16,098
-You need to find your center.
-Yes.

1513
01:23:16,515 --> 01:23:17,640
Do you know anything
about meditation?

1514
01:23:17,641 --> 01:23:19,726
Okay, okay, all right.

1515
01:23:19,976 --> 01:23:23,437
Claire and I agreed to keep things
as normal as possible for Michael.

1516
01:23:23,438 --> 01:23:24,689
-We agreed.
-Yes.

1517
01:23:25,315 --> 01:23:27,066
Well, you should be with her
right now, okay?

1518
01:23:27,067 --> 01:23:29,568
Yes. Claire's alone
in a hospital bed right now.

1519
01:23:29,569 --> 01:23:31,071
She needs you there.

1520
01:23:32,447 --> 01:23:33,864
Paul, Paul, listen to me.

1521
01:23:33,865 --> 01:23:36,200
Stop it, stop it, stop it,
stop it. Look.

1522
01:23:36,201 --> 01:23:37,327
This is the thing.

1523
01:23:37,744 --> 01:23:39,663
We already spoke to Claire.

1524
01:23:40,413 --> 01:23:41,915
She agreed. It's all good.

1525
01:23:43,083 --> 01:23:44,333
Whose idea was it?

1526
01:23:44,334 --> 01:23:45,960
-It really doesn't matter.
-It does.

1527
01:23:45,961 --> 01:23:47,545
-It comes from a place of love...
-It does, it does matter.

1528
01:23:47,546 --> 01:23:49,338
-It does matter. It does.
-No. Why?

1529
01:23:49,339 --> 01:23:52,299
Because if it was your idea
then it's just the usual pathology.

1530
01:23:52,300 --> 01:23:53,968
You know, he took my mom
and dad from me

1531
01:23:53,969 --> 01:23:55,803
and now my son
for his collection.

1532
01:23:55,804 --> 01:23:59,473
Don't tell me that I got the larger part
of the inheritance as proof of something.

1533
01:23:59,474 --> 01:24:01,225
-Like I got that house and you didn't.
-You know, Paul, at some point,

1534
01:24:01,226 --> 01:24:04,812
you're gonna have to stop blaming
other people for who you are.

1535
01:24:04,813 --> 01:24:07,649
If it Claire's idea then, well,
that's between Claire and me.

1536
01:24:08,233 --> 01:24:10,067
But I will not let you steal my son.

1537
01:24:10,068 --> 01:24:12,444
-Steal?
-Paul. I'm not, we're not stealing...

1538
01:24:12,445 --> 01:24:15,781
-Stop saying my name.
-You've said it 11 times.

1539
01:24:15,782 --> 01:24:17,032
Paul. That's your name.
What am I supposed to call you?

1540
01:24:17,033 --> 01:24:18,200
Since Michael...
Whatever, I'm tired of counting.

1541
01:24:18,201 --> 01:24:19,702
Fuck!

1542
01:24:19,703 --> 01:24:21,954
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

1543
01:24:21,955 --> 01:24:24,957
-How about we just...
-Look at this. Look what you've done?

1544
01:24:24,958 --> 01:24:26,126
-We can take him for two...
-Look at it!

1545
01:24:28,086 --> 01:24:30,254
Don't worry about the food. Okay?
We can get him something else.

1546
01:24:30,255 --> 01:24:31,213
Close the door, Stan.

1547
01:24:31,214 --> 01:24:33,716
-Paul.
-Michael, go back upstairs.

1548
01:24:33,717 --> 01:24:34,967
Close the door, Stan.

1549
01:24:34,968 --> 01:24:36,677
-Go back upstairs.
-Michael, go back upstairs.

1550
01:24:36,678 --> 01:24:38,305
Close the fucking door!

1551
01:25:00,243 --> 01:25:02,036
Here we have our dessert course.

1552
01:25:02,037 --> 01:25:04,288
Our melting chocolate egg

1553
01:25:04,289 --> 01:25:06,749
with parsnip cake and grapefruit
on Brazil nuts,

1554
01:25:06,750 --> 01:25:08,626
edible flowers and mint,

1555
01:25:08,627 --> 01:25:11,378
topped with a salted whiskey
caramel sauce.

1556
01:25:11,379 --> 01:25:14,048
And of course, our Bananas Foster
with a cocoa...

1557
01:25:14,049 --> 01:25:15,842
I don't want anything.
Thank you.

1558
01:25:16,551 --> 01:25:19,595
-But you must have it. It's beyond...
-I must?

1559
01:25:19,596 --> 01:25:23,307
No, I don't want it.
I've had enough. Thank you.

1560
01:25:23,308 --> 01:25:25,309
You've never tasted anything like it,
I assure you.

1561
01:25:25,310 --> 01:25:27,102
I said I don't want it.
Can you take it away now?

1562
01:25:27,103 --> 01:25:27,978
-Kate?
-This is not up for debate.

1563
01:25:27,979 --> 01:25:29,605
-I'll take it.
-Thank you.

1564
01:25:29,606 --> 01:25:32,317
-All right.
-All right. Where were we?

1565
01:25:33,026 --> 01:25:34,902
How is everything?
Having a great time.

1566
01:25:34,903 --> 01:25:35,737
Yeah, absolutely.

1567
01:25:35,987 --> 01:25:39,448
I hear there was a problem
with the dessert. I'm horrified.

1568
01:25:39,449 --> 01:25:41,575
-I'm sure it's fine.
-No, everything's fine.

1569
01:25:41,576 --> 01:25:43,452
-Dessert is on us.
-You don't have to do that.

1570
01:25:43,453 --> 01:25:45,247
No, no, I insist.
Anyway, the night...

1571
01:25:45,622 --> 01:25:48,499
You know, the cork, the pin,
the dessert.

1572
01:25:48,500 --> 01:25:49,708
The horror.

1573
01:25:49,709 --> 01:25:52,503
It's all good.
Really, it's all good.

1574
01:25:52,504 --> 01:25:53,963
What else can I get for you?

1575
01:25:53,964 --> 01:25:55,465
You can fucking get lost already.

1576
01:25:58,510 --> 01:26:00,136
Of course, we can leave you alone.

1577
01:26:00,971 --> 01:26:02,721
You know,
I hope you understand that...

1578
01:26:02,722 --> 01:26:04,348
my tolerance from your rudeness,

1579
01:26:04,349 --> 01:26:06,308
it come from the respect
I got for your brother,

1580
01:26:06,309 --> 01:26:10,188
not from any tendency to back away
from throwing a man like you out.

1581
01:26:10,605 --> 01:26:11,855
Believe me, he understands.

1582
01:26:11,856 --> 01:26:14,108
I understand but I don't
necessarily respect you for it.

1583
01:26:14,109 --> 01:26:14,943
I'm sorry.

1584
01:26:16,194 --> 01:26:20,489
He's so obsequiously effete
and sycophantic.

1585
01:26:20,490 --> 01:26:21,365
Come on, let's go.

1586
01:26:21,366 --> 01:26:23,575
What kind of a name is Antonio?
He's probably not even French.

1587
01:26:23,576 --> 01:26:25,537
-Follow me, please.
-He's probably from Cincinnati.

1588
01:26:35,922 --> 01:26:38,925
Nina, could we have
some privacy, please?

1589
01:26:39,175 --> 01:26:42,178
Thank you.
Why don't we sit over here?

1590
01:26:42,595 --> 01:26:45,931
Katelyn, sit over there, please.
You two on the other side.

1591
01:26:45,932 --> 01:26:47,017
Could you that for me, please?
Thank you.

1592
01:26:47,225 --> 01:26:51,687
<i>-Dirty rotten shithole...
-Wanna do this?</i>

1593
01:26:51,688 --> 01:26:52,605
<i>Yeah.</i>

1594
01:26:53,148 --> 01:26:56,109
Hey, come on,
let's fucking do this. Let's do it.

1595
01:26:57,068 --> 01:26:58,360
Are we gonna fucking do this?

1596
01:26:58,361 --> 01:26:59,738
-You get in.
-Get in.

1597
01:27:00,864 --> 01:27:01,906
Here, bitch.

1598
01:27:03,950 --> 01:27:05,243
Shit.

1599
01:27:06,286 --> 01:27:07,495
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

1600
01:27:08,621 --> 01:27:10,957
-Shit.
-Get something big.

1601
01:27:14,085 --> 01:27:16,004
I got her right
in the fucking head, dude.

1602
01:27:16,504 --> 01:27:18,923
Excuse me, could you please
kindly open the door?

1603
01:27:22,177 --> 01:27:24,011
Holy fuck.

1604
01:27:24,012 --> 01:27:25,472
You got, you got it.

1605
01:27:32,729 --> 01:27:35,647
-Look what I found.
-There you go.

1606
01:27:35,648 --> 01:27:39,277
-Go, go, go.
-Get the fuck out.

1607
01:27:40,236 --> 01:27:42,654
Don't scream all night, lady.

1608
01:27:44,407 --> 01:27:45,699
Fucking stink-o.

1609
01:27:45,700 --> 01:27:49,244
-Hey, get out of here.
-Hey, come on, let's get out of here.

1610
01:27:49,245 --> 01:27:51,581
We give you get two minutes
to get the fuck out.

1611
01:27:54,292 --> 01:27:55,460
Get out of here.

1612
01:27:56,878 --> 01:27:57,921
Let's go.

1613
01:28:02,050 --> 01:28:04,302
Shit. Shit.

1614
01:28:16,564 --> 01:28:21,568
-Bullshit political spin on the wrong audience.
-Paul, Paul, Paul.

1615
01:28:21,569 --> 01:28:23,154
I need you to be quiet now.

1616
01:28:24,239 --> 01:28:25,156
Thank you.

1617
01:28:26,825 --> 01:28:28,617
All right, I'm gonna try to explain.

1618
01:28:28,618 --> 01:28:30,245
I spoke to Rick. He's a mess.

1619
01:28:31,287 --> 01:28:32,830
We had a call from his school.

1620
01:28:32,831 --> 01:28:38,544
He spent the entire morning
in the nurse's... crying.

1621
01:28:38,545 --> 01:28:39,920
He's not eating,
he's not sleeping.

1622
01:28:39,921 --> 01:28:41,213
-He's not functional...
-I want to be clear,

1623
01:28:41,214 --> 01:28:42,714
we've not had a chance
to discuss this between us.

1624
01:28:42,715 --> 01:28:44,716
Please, honey.
Well, that's right, that's right.

1625
01:28:44,717 --> 01:28:48,220
I'm speaking for myself, okay?
Just speaking for myself.

1626
01:28:48,221 --> 01:28:52,225
Now...

1627
01:28:55,311 --> 01:29:00,190
I've been trying to see this separately
from my own political future,

1628
01:29:00,191 --> 01:29:01,526
not that that's even possible.

1629
01:29:02,902 --> 01:29:07,198
The most important thing for me
is my son, my son's future.

1630
01:29:10,743 --> 01:29:12,619
I think it's possible

1631
01:29:12,620 --> 01:29:13,997
that they won't be found out.

1632
01:29:14,789 --> 01:29:15,748
Maybe...

1633
01:29:16,166 --> 01:29:17,833
this case will never be solved.

1634
01:29:17,834 --> 01:29:21,629
But is that really what...
What we want?

1635
01:29:22,213 --> 01:29:23,465
For the kids?

1636
01:29:24,048 --> 01:29:25,007
For us?

1637
01:29:25,008 --> 01:29:26,133
I don't think so.

1638
01:29:26,134 --> 01:29:28,678
I don't see it. I don't...

1639
01:29:29,637 --> 01:29:31,264
I don't see myself

1640
01:29:32,432 --> 01:29:34,476
living my life thinking that...

1641
01:29:37,896 --> 01:29:39,481
that my son was involved in a murder.

1642
01:29:40,773 --> 01:29:42,149
Wait, wait, wait a minute.

1643
01:29:42,150 --> 01:29:44,109
Where did you pick up a word like that?

1644
01:29:44,110 --> 01:29:46,236
-You don't mean that. He didn't mean murder.
-No, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1645
01:29:46,237 --> 01:29:47,905
That's going too far, that word.

1646
01:29:47,906 --> 01:29:49,865
-She died with third-degree burns.
-No, no, no. You...

1647
01:29:49,866 --> 01:29:51,993
You're blowing things
way out of proportions, Stan.

1648
01:29:52,869 --> 01:29:55,245
-I mean, this was an accident.
-It was, it was.

1649
01:29:55,246 --> 01:29:57,456
It was an unfortunate
series of events.

1650
01:29:57,457 --> 01:29:58,850
Absolutely.

1651
01:29:59,459 --> 01:30:02,711
-That poor woman was savaged.
-Poor woman? Come on, Stan.

1652
01:30:02,712 --> 01:30:04,004
What was that "poor woman" doing

1653
01:30:04,005 --> 01:30:06,089
camping out there
in the first place.

1654
01:30:06,090 --> 01:30:09,593
I mean, there are many places
for deranged people like that to go.

1655
01:30:09,594 --> 01:30:11,470
-I mean, there are shelters.
-Homeless people...

1656
01:30:11,471 --> 01:30:14,056
Shelters that we pay for
with our own tax dollars.

1657
01:30:14,057 --> 01:30:16,600
-You know, hospital, prison...
-That's not the point. Please.

1658
01:30:16,601 --> 01:30:17,727
That's not the point.

1659
01:30:18,770 --> 01:30:21,438
She was in their way, Stan.

1660
01:30:21,439 --> 01:30:25,026
She was dangerous
and she was threatening them.

1661
01:30:25,360 --> 01:30:27,486
Michael said things
just got out of hand.

1662
01:30:27,487 --> 01:30:29,571
Just imagine
how scared they were.

1663
01:30:29,572 --> 01:30:31,074
They were shaking
when I picked them up.

1664
01:30:31,783 --> 01:30:33,617
These are good boys.

1665
01:30:33,618 --> 01:30:34,910
Not that night, they weren't.

1666
01:30:34,911 --> 01:30:37,079
You weren't there
and I choose to believe my son.

1667
01:30:37,080 --> 01:30:39,623
All right, all right.
Let's not argue anymore. This...

1668
01:30:39,624 --> 01:30:41,625
We have to stick to the point
and when we...

1669
01:30:41,626 --> 01:30:43,293
Okay, this is the point, sweetheart.

1670
01:30:43,294 --> 01:30:45,045
Imagine this,
you open your door,

1671
01:30:45,046 --> 01:30:50,425
and you have to step over
a violent, disgusting bum.

1672
01:30:50,426 --> 01:30:53,262
Someone who's totally out of control.
What do you do?

1673
01:30:53,263 --> 01:30:54,888
-Claire, please.
-What do you do?

1674
01:30:54,889 --> 01:30:56,723
-Do you turn around and go back?
-Claire, it's a human being.

1675
01:30:56,724 --> 01:30:59,101
-You pack up when you're spooked?
-It's a human being.

1676
01:30:59,102 --> 01:31:00,602
I'm not talking about the homeless.

1677
01:31:00,603 --> 01:31:05,357
I'm not talking about the homeless.
I am talking about one bad person.

1678
01:31:05,358 --> 01:31:09,486
One problem. They were just
trying to get her to leave.

1679
01:31:09,487 --> 01:31:11,281
I mean, it was an accident.

1680
01:31:12,198 --> 01:31:15,450
We have to protect the boys now,
for what's done is done.

1681
01:31:15,451 --> 01:31:18,203
Of course it was an accident.
That is not in dispute.

1682
01:31:18,204 --> 01:31:21,708
It was an accident. But the end
result is the end result, so...

1683
01:31:22,458 --> 01:31:26,754
-We have to work out what to do next.
-Yes, yes. Exactly. Thank you.

1684
01:31:27,463 --> 01:31:30,424
This is Rick and Michael's future
we're talking about.

1685
01:31:30,425 --> 01:31:32,552
That's exactly what I wanted
to talk about. The future.

1686
01:31:33,428 --> 01:31:39,349
I don't think our boys can live
with this poison inside them.

1687
01:31:39,350 --> 01:31:41,768
It's gonna rip them apart.
It's already happening with Rick.

1688
01:31:41,769 --> 01:31:43,062
I...

1689
01:31:44,397 --> 01:31:48,400
I spoke to Kate earlier, briefly,
this afternoon.

1690
01:31:48,401 --> 01:31:49,276
-There are other ways...
-She doesn't agree with me...

1691
01:31:49,277 --> 01:31:51,653
-to deal with this, Stan. We don't have to...
-But I've made up my mind.

1692
01:31:51,654 --> 01:31:54,781
-There are other ways that will help...
-For my son, for his future...

1693
01:31:54,782 --> 01:31:56,700
-that don't involve you...
-the only way I can see surviving...

1694
01:31:56,701 --> 01:31:58,619
-throwing away your entire...
-any of this...

1695
01:31:58,620 --> 01:32:01,079
political career and everything
you've ever worked for.

1696
01:32:01,080 --> 01:32:02,205
For him to be able to go on
with his life.

1697
01:32:02,206 --> 01:32:03,165
Doesn't make any sense.

1698
01:32:03,166 --> 01:32:05,460
-I don't know where... I can't find...
-May I? May I?

1699
01:32:06,961 --> 01:32:08,254
Sure. Go ahead, go ahead.

1700
01:32:09,547 --> 01:32:10,756
You're on your own.

1701
01:32:10,757 --> 01:32:12,884
Good luck with your speech.
See you backstage.

1702
01:32:18,348 --> 01:32:20,808
I'm going to withdraw my candidacy.

1703
01:32:21,059 --> 01:32:25,646
For the good of my son, my family,
Michael, you, all of us.

1704
01:32:25,647 --> 01:32:28,273
My bill will pass tomorrow
or it won't. Either way...

1705
01:32:28,274 --> 01:32:31,694
After that,
we're dealing with this.

1706
01:32:31,986 --> 01:32:34,237
-You can't do that.
-Of course he can't.

1707
01:32:34,238 --> 01:32:37,783
You see? It's insane. It's...
After all that we've gone through.

1708
01:32:37,784 --> 01:32:38,909
No, no, that's not what I mean.

1709
01:32:38,910 --> 01:32:40,786
You can't make this
decision alone, Stan.

1710
01:32:40,787 --> 01:32:42,621
I mean, we all have a stake in this.

1711
01:32:42,622 --> 01:32:45,165
Yes. So that's why I wanted to meet.

1712
01:32:45,166 --> 01:32:48,001
That's why I wanted to talk about this.

1713
01:32:48,002 --> 01:32:50,003
Figure out how we're
gonna actually do it.

1714
01:32:50,004 --> 01:32:51,672
-Do what?
-Go public.

1715
01:32:51,673 --> 01:32:53,007
As a family,

1716
01:32:53,675 --> 01:32:54,800
to save our children.

1717
01:32:54,801 --> 01:32:56,719
Don't be a fool, Stan.

1718
01:32:57,512 --> 01:32:58,970
You make a decision like this,

1719
01:32:58,971 --> 01:33:02,058
you also decide the future of my son.

1720
01:33:02,517 --> 01:33:05,102
You have no right.
I won't let you.

1721
01:33:05,103 --> 01:33:08,188
-He is my son.
-Ours.

1722
01:33:08,189 --> 01:33:09,773
And don't play
the noble politician.

1723
01:33:09,774 --> 01:33:12,359
I hate to break it to you
but it's not very noble.

1724
01:33:12,360 --> 01:33:14,403
It's not very modern,
and it's not very you.

1725
01:33:14,404 --> 01:33:16,988
You'll get elected.
You're ahead in polls.

1726
01:33:16,989 --> 01:33:20,200
No, I don't...
How do you explain to your only son

1727
01:33:20,201 --> 01:33:22,911
that you're willing to have
their prospects ruined.

1728
01:33:22,912 --> 01:33:27,499
Their prospects are ruined anyhow,
and not by me.

1729
01:33:27,500 --> 01:33:29,668
Be realistic.
They got away with it.

1730
01:33:29,669 --> 01:33:31,045
It's awful.

1731
01:33:31,754 --> 01:33:34,632
It's unthinkable,
it's... it's terrible.

1732
01:33:35,133 --> 01:33:39,971
But we have a responsibility as parents
to help them cope.

1733
01:33:41,597 --> 01:33:43,557
You don't want to live with this, fine.

1734
01:33:43,558 --> 01:33:45,268
Fine. Drop out.

1735
01:33:45,935 --> 01:33:47,269
But don't expose them.

1736
01:33:47,270 --> 01:33:49,146
-Well, you can't drop out.
-It's not your decision.

1737
01:33:49,147 --> 01:33:52,232
No, fuck, yeah, it is.
Fuck, yeah.

1738
01:33:52,233 --> 01:33:55,026
You feel bad?
Well, then do something about it.

1739
01:33:55,027 --> 01:33:56,737
Make homelessness
your number one priority.

1740
01:33:56,738 --> 01:33:59,781
Give a donation
in this woman's name.

1741
01:33:59,782 --> 01:34:00,824
You can make it right.

1742
01:34:00,825 --> 01:34:02,785
Her name?
They don't even know her name!

1743
01:34:03,578 --> 01:34:05,371
She has no name!

1744
01:34:08,207 --> 01:34:11,543
No amount of money
is going to fix this...

1745
01:34:11,544 --> 01:34:12,544
-in any way.
-What, so you're gonna fix it?

1746
01:34:12,545 --> 01:34:14,671
You're gonna fix it by putting
our boys behind bars?

1747
01:34:14,672 --> 01:34:17,674
Do you have any idea what they do to
a beautiful child like that in prison?

1748
01:34:17,675 --> 01:34:19,134
-Do you?
-They're minors. They're minors.

1749
01:34:19,135 --> 01:34:21,261
No, they'll be tried as adults.

1750
01:34:21,262 --> 01:34:23,430
-They are two white boys.
-Don't pretend that you don't know the law.

1751
01:34:23,431 --> 01:34:25,015
They're gonna have a field day.

1752
01:34:25,016 --> 01:34:27,934
Another case of affluenza, right,
of rich, privileged kids.

1753
01:34:27,935 --> 01:34:30,479
Maybe they should make
an example of them.

1754
01:34:30,480 --> 01:34:32,272
Are you fucking...
That is a child you're talking about.

1755
01:34:32,273 --> 01:34:33,940
Maybe they deserve
whatever comes now.

1756
01:34:33,941 --> 01:34:36,402
-Are you out of your fucking mind?
-You think I want this?

1757
01:34:41,491 --> 01:34:42,575
They...

1758
01:34:43,326 --> 01:34:44,701
They will serve their sentences.

1759
01:34:44,702 --> 01:34:46,119
They will pick up the pieces,

1760
01:34:46,120 --> 01:34:48,747
and we will be with them
every step of the way.

1761
01:34:48,748 --> 01:34:51,875
We will get them the best lawyers.
Thank God, we can do that.

1762
01:34:51,876 --> 01:34:54,211
We will love them,
we will care for them,

1763
01:34:54,212 --> 01:34:55,253
we'll care about them.

1764
01:34:55,254 --> 01:34:58,965
Believe me, I have looked at this
from every possible angle.

1765
01:34:58,966 --> 01:35:00,843
-There's no other choice.
-Yes, there is.

1766
01:35:01,594 --> 01:35:03,553
You do nothing.

1767
01:35:03,554 --> 01:35:06,598
Yeah, I hate to tell you I don't think
this is a police priority.

1768
01:35:06,599 --> 01:35:08,725
And people will forget about it.
It will just blow over.

1769
01:35:08,726 --> 01:35:09,976
Rick will not forget.

1770
01:35:09,977 --> 01:35:11,813
He will come around.

1771
01:35:13,231 --> 01:35:14,190
I won't forget.

1772
01:35:15,650 --> 01:35:17,151
It's not about you.

1773
01:35:18,069 --> 01:35:21,196
The system will fail them.
We won't.

1774
01:35:21,197 --> 01:35:22,447
We can help them.

1775
01:35:22,448 --> 01:35:24,950
We can really help them
find the right kind of care,

1776
01:35:24,951 --> 01:35:27,410
the right kind of counseling,
medication.

1777
01:35:27,411 --> 01:35:28,620
No. I know it won't help.

1778
01:35:28,621 --> 01:35:29,830
It's all about second chances.

1779
01:35:29,831 --> 01:35:30,956
-Won't be enough!
-Why don't you give your son

1780
01:35:30,957 --> 01:35:32,582
-a second chance?
-It won't be enough.

1781
01:35:32,583 --> 01:35:34,460
-It won't be enough.
-It's exactly what's needed.

1782
01:35:37,088 --> 01:35:38,589
Believe me.

1783
01:35:55,314 --> 01:36:00,235
I'm going to set
a press conference in DC

1784
01:36:00,236 --> 01:36:02,195
first thing tomorrow morning
after the vote.

1785
01:36:02,196 --> 01:36:04,739
I'm announcing
I'm suspending my campaign

1786
01:36:04,740 --> 01:36:07,784
and Kate and I will sit down with Rick,

1787
01:36:07,785 --> 01:36:09,536
and we're gonna explain
everything to him.

1788
01:36:09,537 --> 01:36:11,997
And then together,
we're gonna drive to the police

1789
01:36:11,998 --> 01:36:13,415
and make a full confession.

1790
01:36:13,416 --> 01:36:15,376
We'll throw ourselves
on the mercy of the court.

1791
01:36:16,210 --> 01:36:19,672
These boys have committed
a horrific crime.

1792
01:36:20,298 --> 01:36:22,215
They'll have to pay for it.

1793
01:36:22,216 --> 01:36:24,135
It's the only way for them.

1794
01:36:32,268 --> 01:36:34,228
I suggest you do the same
with Michael.

1795
01:36:38,941 --> 01:36:40,610
I'm gonna pay for this, and we'll...

1796
01:36:42,361 --> 01:36:43,654
get out of here.

1797
01:36:53,789 --> 01:36:56,459
Are you just gonna sit there?
Say something.

1798
01:36:57,835 --> 01:36:58,961
Our son.

1799
01:37:00,838 --> 01:37:02,131
Not your son.

1800
01:37:03,382 --> 01:37:04,759
Our son.

1801
01:37:10,222 --> 01:37:11,640
Holy fuck.

1802
01:37:11,641 --> 01:37:14,100
Is this really happening?

1803
01:37:14,101 --> 01:37:17,604
-Dude, this is so fucking intense!
-Why doesn't she just get up?

1804
01:37:20,024 --> 01:37:22,943
Holy shit.

1805
01:37:22,944 --> 01:37:25,111
Come on, come on, dude, let's go.

1806
01:37:25,112 --> 01:37:26,613
No, no, no, hold on.

1807
01:37:26,614 --> 01:37:30,742
We got to get something funny, come on.
We got to have something funny.

1808
01:37:30,743 --> 01:37:32,745
It's not cool, I mean,
dude, come on.

1809
01:37:33,287 --> 01:37:34,330
Here, look.

1810
01:37:34,956 --> 01:37:36,207
Come on, dude, let's go.

1811
01:37:36,374 --> 01:37:38,584
Let's go, come on.
We're out.

1812
01:37:46,926 --> 01:37:47,842
I need to call Michael.

1813
01:37:47,843 --> 01:37:51,013
-What time is it?
-A little after 10:00.

1814
01:37:51,764 --> 01:37:53,599
Poor kid.
He's been alone all night.

1815
01:37:54,976 --> 01:37:56,435
What do you think, Paul?

1816
01:37:56,811 --> 01:37:58,144
Me? What does it matter?

1817
01:37:58,145 --> 01:38:00,647
-Claire's in charge.
-Stop it.

1818
01:38:00,648 --> 01:38:04,234
No, seriously. You haven't said
anything for a while. I want to know.

1819
01:38:04,235 --> 01:38:06,820
I don't think there was anyone
innocent in this story.

1820
01:38:06,821 --> 01:38:07,989
Not even that woman.

1821
01:38:08,489 --> 01:38:12,325
Not even Beau.
Certainly not Barbara. Not even you.

1822
01:38:12,326 --> 01:38:14,119
What do you mean, "Beau"?
Beau wasn't there.

1823
01:38:14,120 --> 01:38:15,204
He doesn't know what he's saying.

1824
01:38:16,706 --> 01:38:18,665
<i>-Hello.
-Hi, sweetheart.</i>

1825
01:38:18,666 --> 01:38:21,668
How are you doing?
Not too bored, I hope.

1826
01:38:21,669 --> 01:38:23,004
<i>Beau wouldn't take the money.</i>

1827
01:38:24,463 --> 01:38:26,172
He says we need to pay for it.

1828
01:38:26,173 --> 01:38:28,008
<i>-How much?
-Not money pay for it.</i>

1829
01:38:28,009 --> 01:38:29,592
To society or some shit.

1830
01:38:29,593 --> 01:38:31,594
<i>-Okay.
-He said I'm the real wuss.</i>

1831
01:38:31,595 --> 01:38:33,847
I'm here with Dad, Stan and Kate,

1832
01:38:33,848 --> 01:38:35,598
and we're going to be
coming home soon.

1833
01:38:35,599 --> 01:38:37,267
So you have time to clean up.

1834
01:38:37,268 --> 01:38:40,562
<i>-What did you have for dinner?
-He's gonna turn us in.</i>

1835
01:38:40,563 --> 01:38:42,148
He's gonna turn us in, Mom.

1836
01:38:42,356 --> 01:38:43,982
He's gonna turn us in.
I know. I mean...

1837
01:38:43,983 --> 01:38:47,319
Okay, listen, don't worry.

1838
01:38:48,279 --> 01:38:49,572
It's just homework.

1839
01:38:50,281 --> 01:38:52,866
Everything always seems
more complicated than this.

1840
01:38:52,867 --> 01:38:53,742
So sit tight.

1841
01:38:53,743 --> 01:38:56,661
<i>-God.
-I'm gonna send Dad home. He'll help.</i>

1842
01:38:56,662 --> 01:38:59,540
<i>-Fuck.
-I love you. I'll see you soon.</i>

1843
01:38:59,707 --> 01:39:00,666
Okay, bye.

1844
01:39:04,128 --> 01:39:05,171
He's fine.

1845
01:39:10,342 --> 01:39:12,344
He's absolutely fine.

1846
01:39:31,238 --> 01:39:33,199
I don't know
what's taking him so long.

1847
01:39:33,824 --> 01:39:34,699
I'll go find out.

1848
01:39:34,700 --> 01:39:37,410
Listen, we need to finish this
conversation because it's not over.

1849
01:39:37,411 --> 01:39:40,413
-No, I know. I'm coming back.
-Not by a long shot and it's urgent.

1850
01:39:40,414 --> 01:39:42,708
I understand, Claire.
You're hurting my arm.

1851
01:39:48,172 --> 01:39:49,881
Beau changed his mind.

1852
01:39:49,882 --> 01:39:52,050
-What the fuck? You kidding me?
-He chickened out.

1853
01:39:52,051 --> 01:39:54,844
-He's gonna expose them.
-Jesus. That dirty, rotten...

1854
01:39:54,845 --> 01:39:56,262
Christ.

1855
01:39:56,263 --> 01:39:58,015
Where are Mr. and Mrs. Lohman?

1856
01:39:59,350 --> 01:40:01,017
We're right here for fuck's sake.

1857
01:40:01,018 --> 01:40:03,269
Of course you are.
But I mean, the other Lohmans.

1858
01:40:03,270 --> 01:40:05,772
-I want this to be our decision.
-Our decision?

1859
01:40:05,773 --> 01:40:08,399
Well, it's not our decision
because you've already made it.

1860
01:40:08,400 --> 01:40:12,946
Stan.
What do you think, Nina?

1861
01:40:12,947 --> 01:40:14,447
-Hey, don't bring her into this.
-Well, what do you mean?

1862
01:40:14,448 --> 01:40:15,544
She's right here.
She's always right here.

1863
01:40:15,545 --> 01:40:16,825
You brought her into it.

1864
01:40:16,826 --> 01:40:18,660
I think he's right.
There's no choice.

1865
01:40:18,661 --> 01:40:20,704
Really? How is this hitting you?

1866
01:40:20,913 --> 01:40:23,999
-I think...
-I told her what she needs to know. That's all.

1867
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:27,836
I'm really, I'm trying
to keep my mind open.

1868
01:40:27,837 --> 01:40:31,005
Listen, listen, you never
listened to me the whole night.

1869
01:40:31,006 --> 01:40:32,382
I've listened to you.
I've listened to you

1870
01:40:32,383 --> 01:40:34,843
when you made me feel like shit
in there for not agreeing with you.

1871
01:40:34,844 --> 01:40:37,595
And now you're making me feel like shit
in here for not agreeing with you.

1872
01:40:37,596 --> 01:40:39,222
I'm done. I'm done fighting.

1873
01:40:39,223 --> 01:40:40,348
Yeah, sure you are.

1874
01:40:40,349 --> 01:40:43,017
Sure you are,
because either way you win.

1875
01:40:43,018 --> 01:40:45,186
Either way I'm fucked.

1876
01:40:45,187 --> 01:40:48,398
-What the fuck are you talking about?
-I have given your family everything, Stan.

1877
01:40:48,399 --> 01:40:50,692
Everything.
I've sobbed for days

1878
01:40:50,693 --> 01:40:52,861
when you weren't around
and Val was impossible.

1879
01:40:52,862 --> 01:40:55,613
I slept on the floor by Beau's bed
for nine months

1880
01:40:55,614 --> 01:40:56,531
when he had those nightmares.

1881
01:40:56,532 --> 01:40:59,200
I've nursed you every time
that you were down.

1882
01:40:59,201 --> 01:41:01,828
I did my best with Rick.
I'm not their mother.

1883
01:41:01,829 --> 01:41:04,748
And you weren't there to defend me
but I fucking tried.

1884
01:41:05,416 --> 01:41:07,293
Because I love those kids.

1885
01:41:07,668 --> 01:41:08,626
And I love you.

1886
01:41:08,627 --> 01:41:09,920
So I didn't care.

1887
01:41:10,546 --> 01:41:13,381
I didn't care every time
that you got a hard-on

1888
01:41:13,382 --> 01:41:15,175
for some adoring little slut

1889
01:41:15,176 --> 01:41:19,179
because I knew that you were shattered
when Barbara left you like that.

1890
01:41:19,180 --> 01:41:20,388
And I picked you up,

1891
01:41:20,389 --> 01:41:23,099
so either way, you would
always come back to me

1892
01:41:23,100 --> 01:41:25,351
and either way,
you needed me.

1893
01:41:25,352 --> 01:41:28,521
Well, either way...

1894
01:41:28,522 --> 01:41:32,233
Either way, Kate is great.
The eternal intern.

1895
01:41:32,234 --> 01:41:34,694
Sweet,
tolerant, tolerant Kate.

1896
01:41:34,695 --> 01:41:36,321
She won't mind,
she's fine.

1897
01:41:36,322 --> 01:41:38,823
Well, no. Not anymore, Stan.
Do you hear me?

1898
01:41:38,824 --> 01:41:42,952
Because if you walk away
from this fight,

1899
01:41:42,953 --> 01:41:45,080
I walk away from you.

1900
01:41:53,505 --> 01:41:56,799
Call the press conference
in the morning after...

1901
01:41:56,800 --> 01:41:58,385
Don't you fucking dare.

1902
01:41:59,345 --> 01:42:00,428
Stan, listen to me.

1903
01:42:00,429 --> 01:42:04,599
Rick won't be able to handle this.
He won't.

1904
01:42:04,600 --> 01:42:07,811
You don't know him like I do.
I'm sorry. But he won't.

1905
01:42:09,521 --> 01:42:12,524
You're making someone else's
tragedy ours.

1906
01:42:13,150 --> 01:42:14,985
It's our tragedy.

1907
01:42:15,319 --> 01:42:17,655
Either way, it's ours,
it's everybody's.

1908
01:42:19,698 --> 01:42:22,743
-Call the press conference.
-Okay, boss.

1909
01:42:23,077 --> 01:42:26,120
"Okay, boss." You do realize
that this is everyone's life.

1910
01:42:26,121 --> 01:42:28,456
-Stop, please. Just do your job.
-No, no, hey, hey, wait up.

1911
01:42:28,457 --> 01:42:30,166
What's in it for you exactly?

1912
01:42:30,167 --> 01:42:33,211
Because it's not your job
because you will lose that. Understand?

1913
01:42:33,212 --> 01:42:34,921
You know, there's a lot of things
you don't know about me.

1914
01:42:34,922 --> 01:42:36,256
Lot of things you never
even bothered to ask.

1915
01:42:36,257 --> 01:42:38,466
You're right. I'm sorry. I'm selfish.

1916
01:42:38,467 --> 01:42:42,804
Right? I'm the trophy wife.
I'm the gold-digger

1917
01:42:42,805 --> 01:42:45,390
and everything else that you've
ever said about me behind my back.

1918
01:42:45,391 --> 01:42:48,851
Did you ever bother to think that I'm
a human being that has feelings?

1919
01:42:48,852 --> 01:42:51,980
No, probably not. But I don't care
because I don't need your pity.

1920
01:42:51,981 --> 01:42:53,606
And I don't need your support.

1921
01:42:53,607 --> 01:42:55,566
Stop it, honey.
Stop, both of you. Just stop.

1922
01:42:55,567 --> 01:42:58,236
I don't think you have
any other move left, Stan.

1923
01:42:58,237 --> 01:43:00,072
No. Of course he does.

1924
01:43:02,074 --> 01:43:04,034
Stan, listen to me.

1925
01:43:05,828 --> 01:43:08,747
You will do more good as a governor

1926
01:43:09,915 --> 01:43:13,002
than you ever will
as a father or a husband.

1927
01:43:14,003 --> 01:43:15,962
You're nothing without politics.

1928
01:43:15,963 --> 01:43:19,174
And that's not all
you're nothing about.

1929
01:43:20,342 --> 01:43:21,677
You need me

1930
01:43:22,678 --> 01:43:24,221
more than I need you.

1931
01:43:25,973 --> 01:43:27,516
And those kids

1932
01:43:28,142 --> 01:43:30,018
need a parent.

1933
01:43:30,019 --> 01:43:33,063
And that's a stone-cold fact.

1934
01:43:42,072 --> 01:43:45,701
No. No. We're talking about

1935
01:43:47,536 --> 01:43:50,581
something here that is so extreme

1936
01:43:51,540 --> 01:43:52,832
and so awful.

1937
01:43:52,833 --> 01:43:55,001
What we're talking about
is you're dead to the woman

1938
01:43:55,002 --> 01:43:56,920
who is raising your children
for you.

1939
01:44:02,885 --> 01:44:05,554
It's the right thing to do, Kate.
You know it is.

1940
01:44:08,390 --> 01:44:10,017
You know, sometimes,

1941
01:44:11,560 --> 01:44:16,315
sometimes the healing thing to do
is to leave the wound alone.

1942
01:44:17,983 --> 01:44:19,401
Come on.

1943
01:44:20,069 --> 01:44:23,696
Give it a week.
We'll talk about it. You and me.

1944
01:44:23,697 --> 01:44:25,448
Look, not here. Not like this.

1945
01:44:25,449 --> 01:44:28,369
We'll go home.
We'll go to the beach house.

1946
01:44:30,037 --> 01:44:34,499
We'll talk and we will discuss things
and we'll make a decision, together.

1947
01:44:34,500 --> 01:44:37,669
As we've always done.
Together.

1948
01:44:42,674 --> 01:44:44,551
What will he become

1949
01:44:46,095 --> 01:44:47,429
if he gets away with this?

1950
01:44:51,225 --> 01:44:53,310
He'll just be our son.

1951
01:44:57,898 --> 01:45:00,818
Honey, I can't wait a week.
Can't do it.

1952
01:45:02,653 --> 01:45:05,530
Okay, well, give it a few days.

1953
01:45:05,531 --> 01:45:08,283
Five? Give me five days.
Come on.

1954
01:45:09,618 --> 01:45:10,744
Come on.

1955
01:45:16,834 --> 01:45:19,210
I'll give you three days.
Give you three days.

1956
01:45:19,211 --> 01:45:20,461
-Okay, three days.
-Three days.

1957
01:45:20,462 --> 01:45:21,463
-Three days.
-Yeah.

1958
01:45:23,006 --> 01:45:25,007
Thank you.

1959
01:45:25,008 --> 01:45:27,511
-Sure.
-Thank you.

1960
01:45:29,972 --> 01:45:31,681
I told you I didn't want
to bring you into this.

1961
01:45:31,682 --> 01:45:34,435
I know how upsetting it is
but we can't go back.

1962
01:45:35,436 --> 01:45:38,479
He doesn't listen to reason.
She has no power over him.

1963
01:45:38,480 --> 01:45:40,606
So we have to take matters
into our own hands.

1964
01:45:40,607 --> 01:45:42,317
I'll take care of Stan.

1965
01:45:43,360 --> 01:45:46,612
I can take care of him.
Okay?

1966
01:45:46,613 --> 01:45:48,073
You have to take care of Beau.

1967
01:45:48,615 --> 01:45:49,616
Can you do that?

1968
01:45:50,492 --> 01:45:52,744
You know what...

1969
01:45:53,078 --> 01:45:54,662
I don't feel so good.

1970
01:45:54,663 --> 01:45:59,334
I haven't, taken my medication.

1971
01:46:00,085 --> 01:46:03,922
I mean, not for a long time.
Not for months.

1972
01:46:07,843 --> 01:46:09,845
I wanted to feel myself again.

1973
01:46:11,138 --> 01:46:12,347
I know.

1974
01:46:14,391 --> 01:46:15,851
When I do the laundry,

1975
01:46:16,935 --> 01:46:19,605
I find the pills you hide
and forget to throw away.

1976
01:46:20,606 --> 01:46:22,649
That's why your
pants' pockets are pink.

1977
01:46:26,236 --> 01:46:27,571
Why didn't you say anything?

1978
01:46:30,866 --> 01:46:32,868
Because I wanted my Paul back.

1979
01:46:35,662 --> 01:46:38,790
Because you were numb
for a really long time.

1980
01:46:41,668 --> 01:46:43,504
Because I was very lonely.

1981
01:46:48,425 --> 01:46:49,510
Listen.

1982
01:46:50,719 --> 01:46:53,055
I know that I let you down.

1983
01:46:54,598 --> 01:47:00,145
I know that Michael doesn't think
I'm much of anything.

1984
01:47:03,106 --> 01:47:06,109
That you're close.
That you...

1985
01:47:07,611 --> 01:47:09,196
It's just you two.

1986
01:47:11,865 --> 01:47:15,952
That you keep things from me.

1987
01:47:15,953 --> 01:47:18,497
-But I can still do things.
-Yes, I know. Good.

1988
01:47:19,748 --> 01:47:22,041
And you could prove it.
So I need you.

1989
01:47:22,042 --> 01:47:23,794
I need you to be strong.

1990
01:47:24,002 --> 01:47:26,087
-I need you to be focused.
-Yeah.

1991
01:47:26,088 --> 01:47:27,923
I need you to go take care of Beau.

1992
01:47:28,715 --> 01:47:31,009
Okay. Take care how?

1993
01:47:33,470 --> 01:47:34,596
Talk to him.

1994
01:47:38,016 --> 01:47:39,642
Okay, check's paid.

1995
01:47:39,643 --> 01:47:41,103
It's gonna be all right.

1996
01:47:41,353 --> 01:47:43,354
-Let's go.
-Come on.

1997
01:47:43,355 --> 01:47:45,816
-Let's blow this Popsicle stand.
-I'm going.

1998
01:47:48,151 --> 01:47:49,695
Where are you...
Where are you going?

1999
01:47:50,779 --> 01:47:51,904
You don't know?

2000
01:47:52,864 --> 01:47:55,200
Sometimes you just have
to let Paul go be Paul.

2001
01:47:55,951 --> 01:47:58,452
But, listen, I want to talk
about this press conference.

2002
01:47:58,453 --> 01:47:59,371
There won't be one.

2003
01:47:59,705 --> 01:48:01,163
For now.

2004
01:48:01,164 --> 01:48:03,333
For now. For now, no.

2005
01:48:05,210 --> 01:48:06,085
What do you mean?

2006
01:48:06,086 --> 01:48:09,131
As far as everyone's concerned,
you all just had a nice, long dinner.

2007
01:48:10,424 --> 01:48:11,882
Let's all go home?

2008
01:48:11,883 --> 01:48:14,135
You need a ride.
We can call you a car.

2009
01:48:14,136 --> 01:48:16,555
What do you mean,
"for now"?

2010
01:48:21,893 --> 01:48:23,687
-Heinz.
-Mr. Lohman.

2011
01:48:24,813 --> 01:48:28,733
Well, it's been a pleasure
serving you and yours,

2012
01:48:28,734 --> 01:48:31,486
volcanic eruptions and all.

2013
01:48:31,695 --> 01:48:35,449
Yeah. Thank you.

2014
01:48:38,785 --> 01:48:40,161
-Good night.
-Thank you.

2015
01:48:40,162 --> 01:48:42,288
Yeah, I'm sorry.

2016
01:48:42,289 --> 01:48:43,664
-All right.
-Good night.

2017
01:48:43,665 --> 01:48:45,876
-All right?
-Yup.

2018
01:48:52,549 --> 01:48:54,301
You're gonna give it three days?

2019
01:48:57,721 --> 01:48:59,931
Yeah, I owe her that much.
I owe my son...

2020
01:49:01,808 --> 01:49:02,851
much more than that.

2021
01:49:06,480 --> 01:49:08,564
Family isn't politics, Stan.

2022
01:49:10,776 --> 01:49:12,778
It's all politics.
Don't be so naive.

2023
01:49:15,155 --> 01:49:17,282
It's all strategic.

2024
01:49:19,368 --> 01:49:23,537
There's never a path
that's been just right or wrong.

2025
01:49:23,538 --> 01:49:25,415
Just a lot of shitty choices.

2026
01:49:27,918 --> 01:49:29,294
Someone always gets hurt.

2027
01:49:31,755 --> 01:49:33,298
Like in politics, right?

2028
01:49:34,466 --> 01:49:36,218
And every family that ever was.

2029
01:49:37,719 --> 01:49:39,262
Okay, so what happens now?

2030
01:49:43,225 --> 01:49:45,310
Some impossible happy ending?

2031
01:49:47,437 --> 01:49:49,981
I know.
Weird fucking fairy-tales, Stan.

2032
01:49:52,567 --> 01:49:54,610
All right.
Good night.

2033
01:49:54,611 --> 01:49:57,572
Yeah, good night.
Thanks.

2034
01:50:07,082 --> 01:50:11,293
<i>War is always motivated
by a profound act of love.</i>

2035
01:50:11,294 --> 01:50:12,921
<i>Much more than hate.</i>

2036
01:50:13,714 --> 01:50:16,799
<i>To fight a war, you have to
deeply love the cause</i>

2037
01:50:16,800 --> 01:50:18,301
<i>and transcend sacrifice.</i>

2038
01:50:19,511 --> 01:50:21,763
<i>You fight for who
and what you love.</i>

2039
01:50:22,472 --> 01:50:23,681
<i>Freedom, power,</i>

2040
01:50:23,682 --> 01:50:24,557
<i>land, treasure...
Open the door, Beau!</i>

2041
01:50:24,558 --> 01:50:26,225
<i>Religion, dominance,</i>

2042
01:50:26,226 --> 01:50:28,353
<i>mother, country, leader.</i>

2043
01:50:28,979 --> 01:50:31,397
<i>I love my family.
Open the goddamn door.</i>

2044
01:50:31,398 --> 01:50:34,401
<i>I love my family.
I love my family.</i>

2045
01:50:35,652 --> 01:50:38,028
<i>I will go to war for my son.</i>

2046
01:50:38,029 --> 01:50:39,655
<i>I know you're in there!
I will go to war</i>

2047
01:50:39,656 --> 01:50:40,907
<i>as an act of love.</i>

2048
01:50:41,116 --> 01:50:43,159
<i>I just want to talk!
You would do the same.</i>

2049
01:50:43,160 --> 01:50:44,118
Come on, Beau!

2050
01:50:44,119 --> 01:50:45,996
<i>You would do the same.</i>

2051
01:50:46,580 --> 01:50:47,831
<i>You would do the same.</i>

2052
01:50:48,457 --> 01:50:50,458
Hey, open the door.

2053
01:50:52,544 --> 01:50:55,171
I'm his uncle. I just want to
speak to him. Open the door.

2054
01:50:57,299 --> 01:50:59,134
Hey! Hey, stop.

2055
01:51:00,010 --> 01:51:01,386
You don't have to hide
from me, Beau.

2056
01:51:02,095 --> 01:51:04,347
You know, we never really
got to know one another.

2057
01:51:04,890 --> 01:51:06,975
You're kinda unknowable.

2058
01:51:07,142 --> 01:51:07,976
I mean, I'm not a bad person.

2059
01:51:08,602 --> 01:51:10,604
If anything, I feel too much.

2060
01:51:11,730 --> 01:51:12,856
You know?

2061
01:51:13,732 --> 01:51:16,485
I just... You know, I see things
from a father's perspective, though.

2062
01:51:17,569 --> 01:51:21,947
You know, what you're trying
to do, Beau, it's...

2063
01:51:21,948 --> 01:51:24,366
it's not right.
It's not what families do.

2064
01:51:24,367 --> 01:51:25,911
Families work together.

2065
01:51:26,953 --> 01:51:30,040
Families work together
to bury the ugly stuff.

2066
01:51:31,249 --> 01:51:34,043
They don't...
Come on out, Beau.

2067
01:51:34,044 --> 01:51:36,504
You... Just want to talk,
you can trust me.

2068
01:51:36,505 --> 01:51:37,838
Come out.

2069
01:51:37,839 --> 01:51:39,299
I'm sorry, Uncle Paul.

2070
01:51:41,384 --> 01:51:43,511
Families will do anything
to protect each other

2071
01:51:43,512 --> 01:51:46,514
and I don't want to hurt you, Beau,
but what choice do I have?

2072
01:51:46,515 --> 01:51:48,266
You didn't give me a choice.

2073
01:51:48,642 --> 01:51:50,060
Claire didn't.

2074
01:51:50,894 --> 01:51:52,771
It's our job to give Michael a future.

2075
01:51:54,064 --> 01:51:56,233
You know, I used
to teach kids your age.

2076
01:51:56,566 --> 01:51:58,442
I thought they loved me,

2077
01:51:58,443 --> 01:52:00,737
but they just didn't want
to listen anymore.

2078
01:52:01,696 --> 01:52:04,449
Scaring you straight
wouldn't work.

2079
01:52:07,702 --> 01:52:08,870
I'm sorry, Beau.

2080
01:52:19,881 --> 01:52:20,965
Beau!

2081
01:52:20,966 --> 01:52:22,466
Hey, Stanley, I was just thinking.

2082
01:52:22,467 --> 01:52:26,178
-Reason's what's separating...
-Is Beau up there?

2083
01:52:26,179 --> 01:52:27,500
<i>Reason is what's
missing from our lives.</i>

2084
01:52:27,501 --> 01:52:28,973
Just be quiet a second, all right?

2085
01:52:28,974 --> 01:52:30,933
-Is Beau up there with you?
-You can't Google reason.

2086
01:52:30,934 --> 01:52:31,976
Quit talking.

2087
01:52:31,977 --> 01:52:33,018
-Did you do something with him?
-No.

2088
01:52:33,019 --> 01:52:34,687
-What did you do?
-Nothing.

2089
01:52:34,688 --> 01:52:35,605
What did you do?

2090
01:52:36,022 --> 01:52:37,816
-Nothing.
-What did you do to him?

2091
01:52:40,610 --> 01:52:42,278
What did you do with him?

2092
01:52:42,279 --> 01:52:45,573
I was just talking to him!

2093
01:52:45,574 --> 01:52:47,576
You don't talk to my son.
Do you hear me?

2094
01:52:47,826 --> 01:52:49,159
You are nothing to me.

2095
01:52:49,160 --> 01:52:51,412
-Stan! Stan!
-I am done with you!

2096
01:52:54,416 --> 01:52:55,541
-What did he do?
-Boy.

2097
01:52:55,542 --> 01:52:56,876
-Where's Beau?
-I don't know.

2098
01:52:56,877 --> 01:52:57,835
Why don't you call him?

2099
01:52:57,836 --> 01:52:59,378
Call him on your phone,
see if you can get him.

2100
01:52:59,379 --> 01:53:01,755
-Stan, over here.
-What is going on?

2101
01:53:01,756 --> 01:53:03,091
He's out there somewhere.

2102
01:53:03,633 --> 01:53:04,968
-Beau!
-Paul.

2103
01:53:05,176 --> 01:53:06,720
It's okay, honey, come here.

2104
01:53:07,888 --> 01:53:09,055
Hey, honey.

2105
01:53:09,306 --> 01:53:10,514
Beau!

2106
01:53:10,515 --> 01:53:12,725
I think he cracked a rib.

2107
01:53:12,726 --> 01:53:16,103
I was just...
I was just talking to Beau.

2108
01:53:16,104 --> 01:53:17,521
I was just talking to him.

2109
01:53:17,522 --> 01:53:19,482
Like you said,
I just took care of everything.

2110
01:53:19,649 --> 01:53:22,861
-And instead he lost his marbles.
-I'll call you back, okay?

2111
01:53:24,321 --> 01:53:25,362
Those are the right numbers?

2112
01:53:25,363 --> 01:53:27,490
We should call Michael, okay?

2113
01:53:27,866 --> 01:53:29,367
-Shit.
-We need to call Michael.

2114
01:53:29,534 --> 01:53:31,453
Say it again.
Tell me again.

2115
01:53:32,245 --> 01:53:34,330
-That many?
-What? What's going on?

2116
01:53:34,331 --> 01:53:36,540
Just hang on. You're sure?

2117
01:53:36,541 --> 01:53:38,043
I got Michael.

2118
01:53:38,209 --> 01:53:39,084
I got the votes.

2119
01:53:39,085 --> 01:53:44,673
It's gonna pass, it's gonna pass,
it's gonna pass.

2120
01:53:44,674 --> 01:53:47,134
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Get me the...

2121
01:53:47,135 --> 01:53:48,595
-Michael.
-Yes, yes.

2122
01:53:49,095 --> 01:53:51,723
No, honey, how are you?
How are you doing?

2123
01:53:53,099 --> 01:53:53,974
Shut up.

2124
01:53:53,975 --> 01:53:56,143
-Everything's gonna be fine.
-No, no. Not you.

2125
01:53:56,144 --> 01:53:57,353
No, I was talking to somebody.

2126
01:53:57,354 --> 01:53:58,771
Daddy took care of everything.

2127
01:53:58,772 --> 01:54:02,691
Okay, call me. Now.

2128
01:54:02,692 --> 01:54:03,776
Mental health for all.

2129
01:54:03,777 --> 01:54:05,987
-You got him?
-No, it's voice-mail. I'll keep trying.

2130
01:54:06,529 --> 01:54:08,572
You did good.
You did real good.

2131
01:54:08,573 --> 01:54:09,574
Beau?

2132
01:54:09,741 --> 01:54:10,908
You were very, very smart.

2133
01:54:10,909 --> 01:54:12,202
This is funny, apes with phones.

2134
01:54:13,828 --> 01:54:15,496
Fucking apes with phones.

2135
01:54:15,497 --> 01:54:18,333
Beau? Thank God.
We were worried sick. Where are you?

2136
01:54:18,625 --> 01:54:19,459
I love you.
