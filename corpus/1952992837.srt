I committed this crime,

he sent his son, Jesus Christ,

that we deserve
and put it on himself.

and devastation

01:56:41,077 --> 01:56:44,538
that fatherlessness brings
in a child's life.

1561
01:56:44,747 --> 01:56:47,207
Our prisons are full
of men and women

1562

who lived recklessly after
being abandoned by their fathers,

1563
01:56:50,920 --> 01:56:54,256
wounded by the men who
should have loved them the most.

1564
01:56:54,799 --> 01:57:00,095
Many now follow the same
pattern of irresponsibility
that their fathers did.

1565
01:57:00,763 --> 01:57:04,933
While so many mothers
have sacrificed to help
their children survive,

1566
01:57:05,143 --> 01:57:08,311
they were never intended
to carry the weight alone.

We thank God for them.

1568
01:57:11,024 --> 01:57:17,779
But research is proving that a child
also desperately needs a daddy.

1569
01:57:17,989 --> 01:57:20,032
There's no way around this fact.

1570
01:57:22,326 --> 01:57:24,703
As you know, earlier this year,

1571
01:57:24,912 --> 01:57:30,083
my family endured the tragic loss
of our 9-year-old daughter, Emily.

1572
01:57:30,251 --> 01:57:32,502
Her death forced me to realize that

1573
01:57:32,670 --> 01:57:37,382
not only had I not taken advantage
of the priceless time I had with her,

1574
01:57:37,592 --> 01:57:41,470
but that I did not truly understand
how crucial my role was

1575
01:57:41,637 --> 01:57:44,931
as a father to her
and our son, Dylan.

1576
01:57:45,725 --> 01:57:49,895
Since her passing, I've asked God
to show me, through his word

1577
01:57:50,104 --> 01:57:53,398
how to be the father
that I need to be.

1578
01:57:54,692 --> 01:57:58,111
I now believe
that God desires for every father

1579
01:57:58,321 --> 01:58:02,282
to courageously step up
and do whatever it takes

1580
01:58:02,450 --> 01:58:04,910
to be involved
in the lives of his children.

1581
01:58:06,496 --> 01:58:09,581
But more than just being there
or providing for them,

1582
01:58:09,791 --> 01:58:12,292
he's to walk with them
through their lives

1583
01:58:12,460 --> 01:58:15,587
and be a visual representation
of the character of God,

1584
01:58:15,755 --> 01:58:17,464
their father in heaven.

1585
01:58:17,632 --> 01:58:22,302
A father should love his children
and seek to win their hearts.

1586
01:58:22,512 --> 01:58:25,305
He should protect them,
discipline them

1587
01:58:25,473 --> 01:58:28,100
and teach them about God.

1588
01:58:28,267 --> 01:58:32,104
He should model how to walk with
integrity and treat others with respect

1589
01:58:32,271 --> 01:58:36,024
and should call out his children to
become responsible men and women

1590
01:58:36,192 --> 01:58:39,402
who live their lives
for what matters in eternity.

1591
01:58:40,154 --> 01:58:42,906
Some men will hear this
and mock it

1592

or ignore it.

1593
01:58:45,159 --> 01:58:49,788
But I tell you that as a father,
you are accountable to God

1594
01:58:49,956 --> 01:58:53,625
for the position of influence
he has given you.

1595
01:58:54,502 --> 01:58:56,711
You can't fall asleep at the wheel

and realize that your job

1597
01:59:00,007 --> 01:59:02,801

have no eternal value

1598
01:59:03,010 --> 01:59:05,804

but have no resolve to live it out.

1601
01:59:12,895 --> 01:59:15,564

they will live for themselves
