00:00:07,023 --> 00:00:09,207
<i> If snowflakes were wishes </i>

2
00:00:09,276 --> 00:00:11,659
<i> Then all your kisses
make my dreams come true </i>

3
00:00:11,728 --> 00:00:13,445
Thank you.
Merry Christmas!

4
00:00:13,513 --> 00:00:16,230
<i> Presents piled high
under the tree </i>

5
00:00:16,299 --> 00:00:19,985
<i> A very special one
just for you </i>

6
00:00:20,053 --> 00:00:23,304
<i> Holidays come
and holidays go </i>

7
00:00:23,373 --> 00:00:26,908
<i> But one thing
I know is true </i>

8
00:00:26,977 --> 00:00:30,178
<i> Your sweet kisses
is all I need </i>

9
00:00:30,246 --> 00:00:33,864
<i>-  My Christmas wish is you 
- [doorbell buzzing]</i>

10
00:00:33,933 --> 00:00:36,934
<i> Your sweet kisses
is all I need </i>

11
00:00:37,003 --> 00:00:40,305
<i> My Christmas wish is you </i>

12
00:00:40,373 --> 00:00:41,890
May I help you?

13
00:00:41,958 --> 00:00:44,259
Your Christmas decorations,
ma'am.

14
00:00:44,327 --> 00:00:46,678
Oh, I think you have
the wrong apartment.

15
00:00:46,746 --> 00:00:48,813
I ordered Chinese food.

16
00:00:48,882 --> 00:00:50,949
Really? At 9 a.m.?

17
00:00:51,018 --> 00:00:54,002
Yeah, don't you eat Chinese food
with your pancakes?

18
00:00:54,071 --> 00:00:57,155
What type of pancakes?

19
00:00:57,224 --> 00:00:58,105
Uh...

20
00:00:58,291 --> 00:01:01,042
Blueberry? Chocolate chip?
Banana?

21
00:01:01,110 --> 00:01:02,994
No, no, no.
None of that nonsense.

22
00:01:03,063 --> 00:01:06,697
Just original, homemade
buttermilk pancakes.

23
00:01:06,766 --> 00:01:10,218
Ohh! I think
I'm in love with you.

24
00:01:10,286 --> 00:01:14,422
Well, you might as well
just come in then.

25
00:01:22,899 --> 00:01:26,701
Emily Taylor and pancakes.
What else is there?

26
00:01:26,770 --> 00:01:28,903
Except maybe... bacon?

27
00:01:28,972 --> 00:01:30,738
- You ate all the bacon.
- When?

28
00:01:30,807 --> 00:01:33,641
Yesterday. Three BLTs?

29
00:01:33,710 --> 00:01:35,343
Oh, yeah.
Those were great.

30
00:01:35,412 --> 00:01:40,765
Oh, wait, we have to toast to
our first Christmas together.

31
00:01:40,834 --> 00:01:42,867
The first of many.

32
00:01:48,058 --> 00:01:49,391
For you.

33
00:01:49,459 --> 00:01:51,860
What is that, a kidney?

34
00:01:52,095 --> 00:01:53,394
It's a heart.

35
00:01:53,463 --> 00:01:55,663
Oh, you're giving me
your heart.

36
00:01:55,932 --> 00:01:57,582
And a kidney if I have to.

37
00:01:57,650 --> 00:02:00,034
No, I'm good for now, thanks.

38
00:02:00,103 --> 00:02:01,319
Oh, how come
I don't have a boyfriend

39
00:02:01,387 --> 00:02:03,421
that comes over
to make me breakfast?

40
00:02:03,490 --> 00:02:05,406
<i>He came over so I would
make him breakfast.</i>

41
00:02:05,475 --> 00:02:06,408
Morning, Toni.

42
00:02:06,476 --> 00:02:09,477
I'm late.
Your dad's gonna kill me.

43
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:12,714
- You're late every day.
- But this time, I'm late-late.

44
00:02:12,783 --> 00:02:14,265
Tell him I'll be
at the shop soon, okay?

45
00:02:14,334 --> 00:02:15,133
Okay.

46
00:02:15,202 --> 00:02:17,535
This is so nice.

47
00:02:17,603 --> 00:02:20,372
I can just sit here.
I can sit here indefinitely,

48
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:21,823
watching TV and eating.

49
00:02:21,892 --> 00:02:25,776
You can start that, but first
can you try on a jacket for me?

50
00:02:25,845 --> 00:02:26,962
Oh, again?

51
00:02:27,130 --> 00:02:28,980
It'll take seconds.

52
00:02:29,049 --> 00:02:31,165
Is it a woman's jacket?

53
00:02:31,234 --> 00:02:32,733
Maybe.

54
00:02:32,802 --> 00:02:34,302
Then that would be a no.

55
00:02:34,371 --> 00:02:36,737
Oh, come on.
It's unisex.

56
00:02:36,806 --> 00:02:39,040
[sighs]

57
00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:43,144
- Is this one of your creations?
- Mm-hmm.

58
00:02:43,213 --> 00:02:46,981
I love that you can make
something out of nothing.

59
00:02:47,050 --> 00:02:49,550
You're such an amazing
clothes designer.

60
00:02:49,619 --> 00:02:51,319
Don't be too impressed.

61
00:02:51,388 --> 00:02:53,120
I haven't actually
sold anything yet.

62
00:02:53,189 --> 00:02:56,341
But you will.
Your designs are beautiful.

63
00:02:57,994 --> 00:02:59,427
It's gonna be a great Christmas.

64
00:02:59,496 --> 00:03:01,963
Yeah, it's your first Christmas
with my family.

65
00:03:02,031 --> 00:03:04,299
I mean, if that doesn't send you
running, I don't know what will.

66
00:03:04,367 --> 00:03:05,967
Do I look like I'm running?

67
00:03:06,035 --> 00:03:08,403
Not yet, but it's only the 18th.

68
00:03:08,472 --> 00:03:10,471
[laughs]

69
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:13,491
Oh, hold on.

70
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:15,643
Unisex?

71
00:03:15,712 --> 00:03:17,996
Okay, I may have lied.

72
00:03:19,116 --> 00:03:20,715
[sighs]

73
00:03:20,784 --> 00:03:23,084
- Carry on.
- Arms down.

74
00:03:31,161 --> 00:03:34,211
Okay, let's see what we
got here. I'm thinking...

75
00:03:34,281 --> 00:03:36,164
I want the sleeves gathered,
but not too much.

76
00:03:36,233 --> 00:03:38,149
Bring up the hem
an inch and a half,

77
00:03:38,218 --> 00:03:39,333
take in the waist,

78
00:03:39,503 --> 00:03:41,369
and one more button
on the back.

79
00:03:41,438 --> 00:03:42,953
So what,
are you a stylist now?

80
00:03:43,022 --> 00:03:46,190
- On second thought, bring up--
- Toni!

81
00:03:46,192 --> 00:03:48,526
- She's all yours.
- Come here.

82
00:03:49,979 --> 00:03:51,446
Hey, Dad!

83
00:03:51,515 --> 00:03:53,280
Hey, baby!

84
00:03:53,349 --> 00:03:54,565
Hi.

85
00:03:54,634 --> 00:03:56,200
Hey, Leo!

86
00:03:56,436 --> 00:03:59,554
How's the big job search
coming along, Mr. MBA?

87
00:03:59,622 --> 00:04:01,639
He just graduated.
Give him a break.

88
00:04:01,708 --> 00:04:04,793
When the time is right, I'm sure
the right job will come along.

89
00:04:04,861 --> 00:04:06,460
I'm not too worried,
Mr. Taylor.

90
00:04:06,529 --> 00:04:08,529
You can drop
the "Mr. Taylor" stuff.

91
00:04:08,598 --> 00:04:10,664
You've been dating my daughter,
what, about a year now?

92
00:04:10,733 --> 00:04:12,450
Almost, yeah.

93
00:04:12,518 --> 00:04:15,253
Do you know how many of her
old boyfriends I approve of?

94
00:04:15,322 --> 00:04:16,353
Maybe 2%.

95
00:04:16,506 --> 00:04:18,689
I mean, not that
there have been that many.

96
00:04:18,758 --> 00:04:21,258
Well, I am honored
to make the cut.

97
00:04:21,327 --> 00:04:22,827
Hey, you're coming over
for Christmas, right?

98
00:04:22,896 --> 00:04:24,228
Wouldn't miss it.

99
00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:26,097
We go all out.
Don't we, Emily?

100
00:04:26,166 --> 00:04:28,866
- We should go out to eat
- [phone ringing]

101
00:04:28,935 --> 00:04:30,318
because, Dad, your cooking...

102
00:04:30,387 --> 00:04:31,702
What's wrong with my cooking?

103
00:04:31,938 --> 00:04:34,873
Uh, sorry.
I have to take this.

104
00:04:36,326 --> 00:04:39,561
I kinda like him.
He's gotta get a job, but--

105
00:04:39,629 --> 00:04:40,928
He's working on it.

106
00:04:40,997 --> 00:04:44,799
I told you I have plans
this Christmas.

107
00:04:44,867 --> 00:04:46,567
I know!

108
00:04:50,073 --> 00:04:52,741
All right.
I'll be there.

109
00:04:55,495 --> 00:04:59,897
Okay, okay, okay,
what exactly did he say?

110
00:04:59,966 --> 00:05:02,900
Is that he needed
to tell me something.

111
00:05:02,969 --> 00:05:04,702
What, in a public place?

112
00:05:04,771 --> 00:05:07,505
People break up with people
in public places.

113
00:05:07,574 --> 00:05:08,673
Where?

114
00:05:08,741 --> 00:05:10,007
Chez Louis.

115
00:05:10,076 --> 00:05:12,142
Ah, that's good.

116
00:05:12,211 --> 00:05:14,512
People propose at Chez Louis.

117
00:05:14,581 --> 00:05:16,380
I know three people
that got engaged there.

118
00:05:16,449 --> 00:05:18,382
I think we're
getting ahead of ourselves.

119
00:05:18,451 --> 00:05:21,151
- Are we?
- Okay, you know what?

120
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:23,153
If he breaks up with me,
then you can hold the Kleenex.

121
00:05:23,222 --> 00:05:27,725
And if he proposes,
then you can be my bridesmaid.

122
00:05:27,794 --> 00:05:29,093
You're not nervous?

123
00:05:29,161 --> 00:05:32,530
No. Why would I be nervous?
It's Leo.

124
00:05:32,599 --> 00:05:35,165
I'm not nervous.
Should I be nervous?

125
00:05:45,411 --> 00:05:47,928
- Hey.
- Hey.

126
00:05:47,997 --> 00:05:49,797
Thanks for coming.

127
00:05:49,866 --> 00:05:52,033
Of course.

128
00:05:52,102 --> 00:05:54,886
Well, this is so formal.

129
00:05:54,955 --> 00:05:57,805
It's kind of unlike you.

130
00:05:57,873 --> 00:06:00,708
Emily, I'm...

131
00:06:02,412 --> 00:06:04,245
I'm not quite sure
how to say this.

132
00:06:04,481 --> 00:06:05,980
Okay, now you're
making me nervous.

133
00:06:06,049 --> 00:06:10,018
There's been a change of plans.
I can't stay here for Christmas.

134
00:06:10,086 --> 00:06:11,185
Is everything okay?

135
00:06:11,254 --> 00:06:14,122
Yes and no.

136
00:06:14,190 --> 00:06:16,774
It's kind of a family thing.

137
00:06:16,843 --> 00:06:18,359
Oh, I understand.

138
00:06:18,428 --> 00:06:22,363
No, you don't. Um...

139
00:06:22,432 --> 00:06:24,298
I should've told you this
as soon as we met,

140
00:06:24,367 --> 00:06:27,234
but we got along so well.

141
00:06:27,303 --> 00:06:29,971
And you liked me for me, and...

142
00:06:30,039 --> 00:06:32,073
then we fell in love
with each other.

143
00:06:32,141 --> 00:06:33,524
And then time
started flying by,

144
00:06:33,593 --> 00:06:35,159
and it kept getting harder
and harder to tell you--

145
00:06:35,228 --> 00:06:37,628
Oh, no.
You're already married.

146
00:06:37,697 --> 00:06:38,546
What?

147
00:06:38,615 --> 00:06:40,431
Are you married?

148
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:43,918
No, no. I'm a... prince.

149
00:06:43,986 --> 00:06:45,720
Wait, what?

150
00:06:47,724 --> 00:06:49,324
I'm...

151
00:06:51,161 --> 00:06:54,746
Prince Leopold of Cordinia.

152
00:06:54,814 --> 00:06:57,848
[laughs]
I'm sorry.

153
00:06:57,917 --> 00:07:00,485
Wait, what's-- where--
What's Cordinia?

154
00:07:00,553 --> 00:07:04,371
It's a small sovereign state
near the south of France.

155
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:07,858
So you're not Leo James.

156
00:07:07,927 --> 00:07:08,876
No, no, no. I am.

157
00:07:08,945 --> 00:07:11,546
Just with a few more names.

158
00:07:11,614 --> 00:07:17,085
It's Leopold James William Henry
Quincy Archibald Devlin...

159
00:07:17,153 --> 00:07:18,419
the Fourth.

160
00:07:18,487 --> 00:07:21,723
So what was this?
I mean us?

161
00:07:21,791 --> 00:07:23,090
It was pretend?

162
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:24,842
No, no, no.
It's quite the opposite.

163
00:07:24,911 --> 00:07:28,946
I feel that my entire life
before you was pretend.

164
00:07:29,015 --> 00:07:30,565
But it's like
I don't even know you.

165
00:07:30,633 --> 00:07:33,200
- I'm still the same person.
- No, no, you're not.

166
00:07:33,269 --> 00:07:35,620
Leo, the Leo I know
wears jeans

167
00:07:35,688 --> 00:07:38,089
and watches reruns
and eats pancakes.

168
00:07:38,157 --> 00:07:40,291
I eat pancakes in Cordinia.

169
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:43,310
Look, I am so sorry.

170
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:45,330
You don't know how much
I wanted to tell you,

171
00:07:45,398 --> 00:07:50,385
but I had a ridiculous promise
with my mother.

172
00:07:50,453 --> 00:07:52,402
The only way she would
let me study abroad

173
00:07:52,471 --> 00:07:54,271
with no bodyguards or handlers

174
00:07:54,341 --> 00:07:57,642
was if I kept my identity
a secret.

175
00:07:57,711 --> 00:08:01,412
Then I met you
and everything changed.

176
00:08:04,067 --> 00:08:06,400
Can you ever forgive me?

177
00:08:07,771 --> 00:08:09,637
Maybe one of you.
I haven't met the other one.

178
00:08:09,706 --> 00:08:13,190
Well, come home with me
for Christmas, and you'll see.

179
00:08:13,259 --> 00:08:16,326
I promise that Leo James
and Prince Leopold,

180
00:08:16,395 --> 00:08:18,295
they're the same person.

181
00:08:18,998 --> 00:08:20,848
Please.

182
00:08:21,718 --> 00:08:24,535
And you promise
you're not married?

183
00:08:26,472 --> 00:08:31,409
I swear on the royal crest.

184
00:08:57,353 --> 00:08:59,787
Queen Isadora,
breakfast is served.

185
00:09:04,661 --> 00:09:07,462
Your toast and marmalade, ma'am.

186
00:09:07,530 --> 00:09:11,032
I mean Your Majesty.

187
00:09:11,101 --> 00:09:13,884
What flavor is the marmalade?

188
00:09:13,953 --> 00:09:15,352
Mandarin, ma'am.

189
00:09:15,421 --> 00:09:17,204
I prefer quince.

190
00:09:17,273 --> 00:09:19,223
And 1%, not 2% milk.

191
00:09:19,459 --> 00:09:20,358
Yes, ma'am.

192
00:09:23,095 --> 00:09:26,080
Your tea, Your Majesty.

193
00:09:26,382 --> 00:09:28,432
You are pouring
from the wrong side.

194
00:09:28,501 --> 00:09:29,867
You might ease up on them.

195
00:09:29,936 --> 00:09:33,837
Will and Olivia are new.
They'll get it right.

196
00:09:33,857 --> 00:09:35,306
Well, alert me when they do,

197
00:09:35,375 --> 00:09:38,910
and we'll commemorate
with an oil painting.

198
00:09:40,947 --> 00:09:42,747
What happened
to the previous footman?

199
00:09:42,815 --> 00:09:45,733
The same thing that happened
to the previous three:

200
00:09:45,801 --> 00:09:46,934
you.

201
00:09:48,938 --> 00:09:51,956
I suppose I'm a little
on edge lately.

202
00:09:52,024 --> 00:09:53,641
I hadn't noticed.

203
00:09:55,077 --> 00:09:59,012
I just want everything
to go well... with Leopold.

204
00:09:59,081 --> 00:10:00,381
I'm sure it will.

205
00:10:00,450 --> 00:10:02,066
I feel that
I don't know him anymore,

206
00:10:02,135 --> 00:10:03,467
and he's bringing home a girl.

207
00:10:03,536 --> 00:10:05,753
- An American?
- Yes.

208
00:10:05,821 --> 00:10:08,889
I hear some of them
can be quite pleasant.

209
00:10:08,958 --> 00:10:10,057
[scoffs]

210
00:10:10,126 --> 00:10:13,494
Well, I certainly hope
it's nothing serious.

211
00:10:16,232 --> 00:10:18,299
The tea is tepid.

212
00:10:21,588 --> 00:10:22,737
TONI: All this time
you've been dating him,

213
00:10:22,805 --> 00:10:25,222
and he's secretly
been a prince?

214
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:27,441
Oh, I can't believe it.

215
00:10:27,510 --> 00:10:29,226
When my boyfriends
withhold information,

216
00:10:29,295 --> 00:10:32,396
it's that they're unemployed,
and I'm paying for dinner.

217
00:10:32,465 --> 00:10:33,931
I wish your Mom was here.

218
00:10:33,999 --> 00:10:36,617
I know. Me too. We never
spent a Christmas apart.

219
00:10:36,869 --> 00:10:38,335
I can't stand the thought
of you being alone.

220
00:10:38,672 --> 00:10:39,437
Hey, he's got me.

221
00:10:39,506 --> 00:10:41,856
Yeah, like you said, alone.

222
00:10:41,925 --> 00:10:42,957
[horn honks]

223
00:10:45,244 --> 00:10:47,010
Hey.

224
00:10:47,079 --> 00:10:49,363
- Hi.
- Hey.

225
00:10:49,432 --> 00:10:51,932
- How are you?
- Leo.

226
00:10:52,001 --> 00:10:53,834
I don't know whether
to shake hands or bow.

227
00:10:53,903 --> 00:10:55,970
Oh, come here.

228
00:10:56,038 --> 00:11:01,108
Leo, you don't mind, do you?
For the shop wall.

229
00:11:01,177 --> 00:11:02,193
Dad!

230
00:11:02,261 --> 00:11:05,496
Anything for the shop wall.

231
00:11:05,565 --> 00:11:07,532
- Really?
- He's embarrassing.

232
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,634
- Sorry.
- There you go.

233
00:11:09,702 --> 00:11:12,537
Oh, this is going right next to
Sylvester Stallone's brother.

234
00:11:12,605 --> 00:11:14,789
Wow. That means a lot.

235
00:11:16,359 --> 00:11:18,709
Now you have a good time.

236
00:11:18,777 --> 00:11:21,546
- I...
- What's the matter?

237
00:11:21,614 --> 00:11:23,013
I don't know.
What if she doesn't like me?

238
00:11:23,082 --> 00:11:24,665
How do I know
she's gonna like me?

239
00:11:24,733 --> 00:11:26,250
Who couldn't like you?

240
00:11:26,319 --> 00:11:28,252
You just be yourself.

241
00:11:28,504 --> 00:11:31,722
Be proud of who you are
because I am.

242
00:11:32,408 --> 00:11:34,358
You're my princess.

243
00:11:34,426 --> 00:11:37,394
- I love you.
- I love you.

244
00:11:37,463 --> 00:11:39,013
Have a great time.

245
00:11:39,081 --> 00:11:40,198
- Bye-bye!
- Bye.

246
00:11:40,349 --> 00:11:42,516
- Leo.
- Merry Christmas.

247
00:11:42,584 --> 00:11:46,153
Merry Christmas to you.
I love you, baby.

248
00:11:46,222 --> 00:11:47,404
Merry Christmas.

249
00:11:47,473 --> 00:11:50,174
Bye. Bye!

250
00:11:50,243 --> 00:11:52,910
Call! Have fun!

251
00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:27,044
Welcome to my humble abode.

252
00:12:27,113 --> 00:12:28,412
Whoa.

253
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:29,396
Come on,
let's meet the staff,

254
00:12:29,465 --> 00:12:31,248
although they're
more like family.

255
00:12:31,317 --> 00:12:33,734
Victor, good to see you.

256
00:12:34,003 --> 00:12:35,620
You're looking well,
Your Royal Highness.

257
00:12:35,688 --> 00:12:37,054
America seems to suit you.

258
00:12:37,323 --> 00:12:39,373
You have no idea how much.

259
00:12:39,441 --> 00:12:41,659
I think I might.

260
00:12:41,727 --> 00:12:43,510
Emily, this is Victor,
head butler.

261
00:12:43,579 --> 00:12:45,862
It's so nice to meet you,
Victor.

262
00:12:45,931 --> 00:12:47,982
And you too, miss.

263
00:12:48,051 --> 00:12:49,917
Thanks.

264
00:12:50,903 --> 00:12:51,953
Hi, everyone.

265
00:12:55,224 --> 00:12:59,259
It's really nice
to meet everyone. Hi.

266
00:13:00,613 --> 00:13:03,781
Oh. You have guards
with feathered hats.

267
00:13:03,850 --> 00:13:07,885
Yeah. I've been trying to get a
reaction out of them for years.

268
00:13:07,954 --> 00:13:09,086
Gentlemen.

269
00:13:13,493 --> 00:13:14,809
See?

270
00:13:14,877 --> 00:13:16,243
Nothing.

271
00:13:17,613 --> 00:13:19,713
LEO: That last time
Cordinia ever got snows

272
00:13:19,782 --> 00:13:20,998
was over 40 years ago.

273
00:13:21,067 --> 00:13:25,419
They still call it
the Cordinian Christmas miracle.

274
00:13:26,288 --> 00:13:28,639
Oh, wow.

275
00:13:34,814 --> 00:13:37,948
Leopold!
You're here at last.

276
00:13:38,050 --> 00:13:40,500
And wearing
someone else's clothes.

277
00:13:40,569 --> 00:13:42,803
Were you robbed?

278
00:13:42,872 --> 00:13:45,223
Good to see you too, Mother.

279
00:13:45,291 --> 00:13:46,873
Is it?

280
00:13:46,943 --> 00:13:49,209
Because if it was, you would
have come home more often.

281
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:54,048
Mother, this is Emily Taylor.

282
00:13:54,116 --> 00:13:58,435
Hi. It's very nice
to meet you, Mrs...

283
00:13:58,504 --> 00:14:00,103
Queen.

284
00:14:00,173 --> 00:14:02,039
Your Majestyness.

285
00:14:02,175 --> 00:14:06,610
And so nice to meet
an acquaintance of Leopold's.

286
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:10,280
Emily is more than
an acquaintance.

287
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:12,983
She's my girlfriend.

288
00:14:19,008 --> 00:14:20,074
Mother?

289
00:14:20,143 --> 00:14:25,228
Well, you can't imagine
my delight.

290
00:14:27,416 --> 00:14:30,250
Wow. What a beautiful room.

291
00:14:30,319 --> 00:14:32,219
I love your Christmas tree.

292
00:14:32,288 --> 00:14:34,638
I brought you a gift
from Philadelphia,

293
00:14:34,706 --> 00:14:36,873
the city of brotherly love.

294
00:14:36,942 --> 00:14:38,575
Oh.

295
00:14:38,644 --> 00:14:41,195
How thoughtful and unexpected.

296
00:14:43,166 --> 00:14:45,332
A cracked bell.

297
00:14:45,401 --> 00:14:46,851
Oh, it's the Liberty Bell.

298
00:14:46,919 --> 00:14:49,370
And a bald man with glasses.

299
00:14:49,439 --> 00:14:51,722
Benjamin Franklin.

300
00:14:51,791 --> 00:14:55,092
I find it fascinating
that your Mr. Franklin

301
00:14:55,161 --> 00:14:57,361
has been credited with
discovering electricity

302
00:14:57,430 --> 00:15:01,164
when in fact it was
discovered 150 years prior

303
00:15:01,233 --> 00:15:04,285
by William Gilbert,
an Englishman.

304
00:15:04,353 --> 00:15:06,137
Oh.

305
00:15:06,205 --> 00:15:11,041
Only you could find fault
in Benjamin Franklin, Mother.

306
00:15:11,244 --> 00:15:14,661
Everyone has faults, dear.
Some more than others.

307
00:15:14,730 --> 00:15:17,681
Well, thank you
for your charming gift.

308
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:19,550
Would you put this
someplace special?

309
00:15:19,619 --> 00:15:22,002
[barking]

310
00:15:22,071 --> 00:15:24,404
Oh, look at you!

311
00:15:24,473 --> 00:15:25,772
Oh, you're so cute!

312
00:15:28,544 --> 00:15:30,210
[laughs]

313
00:15:30,279 --> 00:15:32,612
Oh, and I think I have
a sweater just like this,

314
00:15:32,681 --> 00:15:35,366
only not as nice.

315
00:15:35,434 --> 00:15:36,533
This is Wheaties.

316
00:15:36,853 --> 00:15:39,570
Mother is very attached
to her dogs.

317
00:15:39,639 --> 00:15:44,024
Well, they're very loyal,
and they don't leave home.

318
00:15:45,327 --> 00:15:49,162
Would you mind if I had
a few moments alone

319
00:15:49,231 --> 00:15:50,314
with Leopold, dear?

320
00:15:50,383 --> 00:15:51,548
Oh, sure.

321
00:15:51,784 --> 00:15:53,000
Victor will show you
to your room.

322
00:15:53,068 --> 00:15:55,903
Take our American guest
to the Gold Room.

323
00:15:55,972 --> 00:15:57,538
Oh, the Gold Room.
That sounds beautiful.

324
00:15:57,607 --> 00:16:01,808
Yes. It's also the farthest room
possible away from my room.

325
00:16:01,877 --> 00:16:04,077
It has an excellent view.

326
00:16:04,146 --> 00:16:05,629
Of the cemetery.

327
00:16:05,698 --> 00:16:08,732
Victor, take Emily
to the Cardinal Suite.

328
00:16:08,801 --> 00:16:10,551
It's being renovated.

329
00:16:10,619 --> 00:16:14,871
You know what? The cemetery
view, that's gonna be fine.

330
00:16:16,492 --> 00:16:17,708
[barking]

331
00:16:17,777 --> 00:16:19,160
See you later.

332
00:16:20,813 --> 00:16:23,314
- This way.
- Thank you.

333
00:16:27,069 --> 00:16:29,636
Why am I only just
hearing about this now?

334
00:16:29,906 --> 00:16:32,823
Because if I told you
about it earlier,

335
00:16:32,892 --> 00:16:35,493
it would only have given you
more time to ruin things.

336
00:16:35,561 --> 00:16:39,029
- You've been infatuated before.
- We love each other.

337
00:16:39,098 --> 00:16:41,148
I know you like to be
in control of things,

338
00:16:41,217 --> 00:16:44,384
but my feelings,
they're not in your realm.

339
00:16:44,453 --> 00:16:47,004
One day you're going to be king,
whether you like it or not,

340
00:16:47,073 --> 00:16:51,258
and with that position
comes responsibility.

341
00:16:51,327 --> 00:16:52,242
You don't even know her.

342
00:16:52,461 --> 00:16:54,595
I don't need to.
She's a commoner.

343
00:16:54,664 --> 00:16:58,965
Actually, she's the most
uncommon girl I've ever known.

344
00:16:59,034 --> 00:17:02,035
I should never have allowed you
to go to America.

345
00:17:02,104 --> 00:17:04,037
You were supposed
to get an education,

346
00:17:04,106 --> 00:17:06,273
come back here
and marry Natasha.

347
00:17:08,744 --> 00:17:10,311
What happened to the plan?

348
00:17:10,446 --> 00:17:15,398
That was your plan, Mother,
not mine.

349
00:17:20,656 --> 00:17:26,260
We have 2,000 acres,
75 staff, 118 rooms, 4 wings.

350
00:17:26,328 --> 00:17:28,361
Do you have MapQuest?

351
00:17:28,430 --> 00:17:29,729
You get used to it.

352
00:17:29,799 --> 00:17:31,731
- How long have you lived here?
- All my life.

353
00:17:31,801 --> 00:17:33,733
My father worked for
Queen Isadora's father.

354
00:17:33,803 --> 00:17:35,903
Oh, so you and she kind of
grew up together.

355
00:17:35,971 --> 00:17:38,605
<i>In an Upstairs, Downstairs way,
I suppose.</i>

356
00:17:38,674 --> 00:17:40,174
- She's beautiful.
- She is that.

357
00:17:40,242 --> 00:17:41,842
- And terrifying.
- That too.

358
00:17:41,911 --> 00:17:43,744
Do you think she'll ever
warm up to me?

359
00:17:43,812 --> 00:17:45,746
Miracles do happen.

360
00:17:55,908 --> 00:17:58,409
Dinner is served.

361
00:17:58,477 --> 00:18:00,544
Seared duck,

362
00:18:00,613 --> 00:18:02,112
orange duck,

363
00:18:02,180 --> 00:18:04,581
and the Queen's special goose.

364
00:18:04,650 --> 00:18:06,200
Duck, duck, goose!

365
00:18:06,268 --> 00:18:10,186
And last, but not least,
jellied eels and haggis.

366
00:18:10,255 --> 00:18:11,488
Really, Mother?

367
00:18:11,557 --> 00:18:16,927
I thought Emily might enjoy some
traditional European dishes.

368
00:18:16,995 --> 00:18:19,379
Thank you.

369
00:18:19,448 --> 00:18:21,014
Yes, it's certainly not
something you can find

370
00:18:21,083 --> 00:18:23,133
at the local diner.

371
00:18:23,201 --> 00:18:25,419
I'm sorry.
What is haggis?

372
00:18:25,488 --> 00:18:26,470
Don't ask.

373
00:18:35,464 --> 00:18:37,464
Here we go.

374
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:45,355
Uhh.

375
00:18:47,710 --> 00:18:49,292
Mm.

376
00:18:50,830 --> 00:18:53,630
Mmm! That's--

377
00:18:53,699 --> 00:18:55,816
That's delicious.

378
00:19:04,927 --> 00:19:05,926
Really good.

379
00:19:05,995 --> 00:19:08,428
Apparently.

380
00:19:09,815 --> 00:19:14,251
So, Emily,
what do your people do?

381
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:17,671
Well, my people--
or my person--

382
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:19,406
he's a tailor.

383
00:19:19,474 --> 00:19:22,192
- A tailor.
- Yes.

384
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:25,378
We have a shop. It's been
in our family for 47 years.

385
00:19:25,447 --> 00:19:26,797
How quaint.

386
00:19:26,866 --> 00:19:29,333
This castle's been in ours
for 900.

387
00:19:29,402 --> 00:19:32,453
Oh, well, it's not
too far apart then.

388
00:19:32,521 --> 00:19:34,571
So you work
in your father's shop?

389
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:35,322
Yes.

390
00:19:35,391 --> 00:19:38,024
You must have
other aspirations.

391
00:19:38,261 --> 00:19:40,811
Emily's a clothes designer.

392
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:42,696
She made the dress
she's wearing.

393
00:19:42,764 --> 00:19:45,198
Oh.

394
00:19:45,267 --> 00:19:48,051
And what label
do you design for?

395
00:19:49,404 --> 00:19:52,272
Well, none yet, but I just
finished a line of dresses

396
00:19:52,341 --> 00:19:56,343
and jackets and hoodies that
I have really high hopes for.

397
00:19:56,411 --> 00:19:58,145
Hoodies?

398
00:20:00,399 --> 00:20:02,966
Well, the world awaits.

399
00:20:08,173 --> 00:20:10,824
Sorry.
That was excruciating.

400
00:20:10,893 --> 00:20:13,309
Nah, I'll live.
It's just a flesh wound.

401
00:20:13,378 --> 00:20:16,947
Now you know where the term
"royal pain" comes from.

402
00:20:17,016 --> 00:20:19,115
How did you grow up
to be so normal?

403
00:20:19,184 --> 00:20:21,018
Well, she wasn't always
like this.

404
00:20:21,086 --> 00:20:24,354
Since Father died,
I'm all she really has left.

405
00:20:24,423 --> 00:20:25,488
And her kingdom.

406
00:20:25,558 --> 00:20:27,691
Yeah, but she can control them.

407
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:28,859
You know,
why did I say "hoodies"?

408
00:20:28,928 --> 00:20:30,160
I should have said
"sweaters."

409
00:20:30,228 --> 00:20:31,695
I don't think
it would have mattered.

410
00:20:31,764 --> 00:20:33,897
You're right. I should have said
I was a cardiac surgeon.

411
00:20:33,966 --> 00:20:36,600
No. She hates doctors.

412
00:20:36,669 --> 00:20:38,969
Come on. Let me give you
a tour of the castle.

413
00:20:39,038 --> 00:20:42,673
Should I grab my hiking boots?

414
00:20:42,741 --> 00:20:44,174
Very funny.

415
00:20:44,242 --> 00:20:48,112
My favorite is
the weapons room.

416
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:49,929
Wow! Okay, what is this for?

417
00:20:49,998 --> 00:20:52,466
To fight
a fire-breathing dragon?

418
00:20:52,534 --> 00:20:54,634
Exactly. Oh!

419
00:20:54,703 --> 00:20:56,036
Should we fence?

420
00:20:56,104 --> 00:20:58,305
- No, absolutely not.
- I'll teach you.

421
00:20:58,374 --> 00:21:00,307
I don't even know
how to hold a sword.

422
00:21:00,376 --> 00:21:04,678
You'll love it. So back a bit,
hand behind the back.

423
00:21:04,747 --> 00:21:06,480
- Okay.
- En garde.

424
00:21:06,549 --> 00:21:07,814
And lunge.

425
00:21:07,883 --> 00:21:09,883
Okay.

426
00:21:09,951 --> 00:21:12,269
And one...

427
00:21:12,338 --> 00:21:14,370
two, three.

428
00:21:14,473 --> 00:21:16,306
Those are the perfect shoes
for it.

429
00:21:16,508 --> 00:21:18,525
When you put it all
together,

430
00:21:18,594 --> 00:21:22,395
it looks a little
something like...

431
00:21:26,335 --> 00:21:28,585
Wow. That's amazing.

432
00:21:28,654 --> 00:21:31,421
I think you have fenced
for a girl or two.

433
00:21:31,490 --> 00:21:33,223
Not in a very long time.

434
00:21:33,291 --> 00:21:35,625
- Your turn.
- My turn?

435
00:21:35,694 --> 00:21:36,826
Mm-hmm.

436
00:21:36,895 --> 00:21:38,561
Okay, my turn.

437
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:39,996
I can do this. Okay.

438
00:21:40,065 --> 00:21:42,415
- Elbow.
- Elbow down.

439
00:21:42,484 --> 00:21:44,250
En garde.

440
00:21:46,588 --> 00:21:48,038
[swish, thwack]

441
00:21:53,896 --> 00:21:55,262
It was an accident.

442
00:21:55,330 --> 00:21:56,930
Uh...

443
00:21:56,999 --> 00:21:59,432
Anyone asks,
we were never here.

444
00:22:00,735 --> 00:22:04,254
And this is the ballroom.

445
00:22:04,322 --> 00:22:05,388
Wow.

446
00:22:05,457 --> 00:22:07,557
The palace has held
the Christmas ball here

447
00:22:07,626 --> 00:22:09,292
for over a century.

448
00:22:09,361 --> 00:22:12,262
Mother still hasn't forgiven me
for missing last year.

449
00:22:12,330 --> 00:22:13,463
It's her favorite night.

450
00:22:13,666 --> 00:22:15,982
But everything
has to be perfect.

451
00:22:16,051 --> 00:22:17,684
Well, if it has to be perfect,

452
00:22:17,753 --> 00:22:20,053
then I think I'll be spending
the night in the Gold Room.

453
00:22:20,122 --> 00:22:21,889
No, no, no, no.

454
00:22:21,957 --> 00:22:25,325
You'll be here with me
waltzing.

455
00:22:25,394 --> 00:22:28,128
Yeah, because I'm so known
for my waltzing.

456
00:22:28,196 --> 00:22:32,265
I know what we need.
Some music.

457
00:22:32,334 --> 00:22:33,266
Oh, no.

458
00:22:33,469 --> 00:22:36,536
- Ready?
- No, no, no, no.

459
00:22:36,605 --> 00:22:41,842
<i>떰</i>

460
00:22:41,910 --> 00:22:43,209
Ready?

461
00:22:43,278 --> 00:22:45,411
Oh! Oh, where do I go?

462
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:47,781
- I'm leading.
- Okay, so where do I go?

463
00:22:47,850 --> 00:22:49,349
- Ready?
- Yes.

464
00:22:51,487 --> 00:22:53,386
- That's it.
- Oh, yeah, this is waltzing.

465
00:22:53,455 --> 00:22:55,555
I don't think this is waltzing.

466
00:22:55,624 --> 00:22:56,623
This is more fun.

467
00:22:59,762 --> 00:23:02,295
[laughter]

468
00:23:05,067 --> 00:23:06,900
[laughter continues]

469
00:23:06,969 --> 00:23:09,119
They look so happy together.

470
00:23:09,188 --> 00:23:11,070
A pity.

471
00:23:11,139 --> 00:23:16,810
[laughter]

472
00:23:16,878 --> 00:23:18,879
Whee!

473
00:23:18,948 --> 00:23:23,566
[thunder rumbling]

474
00:23:32,410 --> 00:23:34,811
It's not a dream.

475
00:23:40,386 --> 00:23:42,652
Where was the kitchen?

476
00:23:45,273 --> 00:23:47,691
This isn't the kitchen.

477
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:51,544
Oh, do you know where
the kitchen is, kind sir?

478
00:23:52,331 --> 00:23:54,581
Ooh, look at this sword.

479
00:23:54,650 --> 00:23:58,151
May I borrow your sword,
kind sir?

480
00:23:58,220 --> 00:24:00,754
What's that?
You want a duel?

481
00:24:01,790 --> 00:24:02,806
You want a duel?

482
00:24:02,874 --> 00:24:04,424
And you want a duel?

483
00:24:04,493 --> 00:24:07,544
You don't know who
you are messing with.

484
00:24:11,433 --> 00:24:12,816
[clatters]

485
00:24:12,885 --> 00:24:14,400
I'm so sorry,
Your Majesty.

486
00:24:14,469 --> 00:24:16,869
I just was looking
for the kitchen.

487
00:24:16,938 --> 00:24:18,304
I was hungry.

488
00:24:18,306 --> 00:24:21,491
A knife and fork
are the usual utensils.

489
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:23,110
Everything all right,
Your Majesty?

490
00:24:23,212 --> 00:24:26,363
Please escort our guest
to the kitchen

491
00:24:26,432 --> 00:24:28,665
before she draws blood.

492
00:24:31,854 --> 00:24:33,487
Sorry.

493
00:24:40,262 --> 00:24:42,312
[phone ringing]

494
00:24:43,615 --> 00:24:44,814
[ring]

495
00:24:46,852 --> 00:24:48,285
[ring]

496
00:24:52,023 --> 00:24:53,290
Toni, hi.

497
00:24:53,358 --> 00:24:56,176
Where are you
at this very moment?

498
00:24:56,244 --> 00:24:58,445
[sighs]
The Gold Room.

499
00:24:58,513 --> 00:25:01,147
There's a Gold Room?

500
00:25:01,216 --> 00:25:05,435
Yes, and 117 rooms
in other colors.

501
00:25:05,504 --> 00:25:08,354
Toni, it is an honest to
goodness real-life castle.

502
00:25:08,423 --> 00:25:10,440
So how's Leo's mom?

503
00:25:10,508 --> 00:25:15,128
Well, remember how I always said
I missed out on having a mother?

504
00:25:15,196 --> 00:25:17,898
Yeah, I might have
changed my mind on that.

505
00:25:17,966 --> 00:25:19,365
[knocking]

506
00:25:19,435 --> 00:25:21,718
Oh, I gotta go.
I love you guys. Bye.

507
00:25:21,786 --> 00:25:23,603
- Love you. Good luck.
- Bye.

508
00:25:24,690 --> 00:25:27,190
Good morning.
May I come in, miss?

509
00:25:27,259 --> 00:25:30,177
Yeah. I mean,
mi castle, su castle.

510
00:25:30,479 --> 00:25:32,095
Your tea.

511
00:25:32,164 --> 00:25:34,798
Oh, thank you.

512
00:25:36,301 --> 00:25:38,067
Oh, no, no, no.
I'll do that.

513
00:25:38,136 --> 00:25:41,388
- Please.
- Oh, let me do my job.

514
00:25:41,456 --> 00:25:44,574
No, I'm so sorry.
I am such a messy traveler.

515
00:25:44,776 --> 00:25:47,327
It's like my suitcase
just explodes.

516
00:25:47,396 --> 00:25:50,163
If you don't
mind me saying,

517
00:25:50,232 --> 00:25:52,515
you're different
than the others.

518
00:25:55,019 --> 00:25:56,753
Others?

519
00:25:56,821 --> 00:26:00,707
How many girls
has Leo brought home?

520
00:26:00,775 --> 00:26:03,910
Oh, no, miss.
Royals, I mean.

521
00:26:04,046 --> 00:26:08,732
You're different than most of
the ones that visited here.

522
00:26:08,801 --> 00:26:10,867
Oh.

523
00:26:10,936 --> 00:26:12,702
Is that a good thing?

524
00:26:12,771 --> 00:26:14,955
Oh, yes.

525
00:26:15,023 --> 00:26:16,239
Yes, miss.

526
00:26:16,308 --> 00:26:17,807
Oh, and it's Emily.

527
00:26:17,893 --> 00:26:20,510
You don't have to call me miss.
What's your name?

528
00:26:20,779 --> 00:26:23,696
It's Olivia.
Pleased to meet you, miss.

529
00:26:23,765 --> 00:26:27,300
I mean... Emily.

530
00:26:27,368 --> 00:26:30,520
It's nice to meet you too.

531
00:26:30,589 --> 00:26:33,857
And thank you for the help.
I can obviously use it.

532
00:26:34,943 --> 00:26:37,026
I don't understand
what you see in her.

533
00:26:37,095 --> 00:26:38,545
I can be myself with her.

534
00:26:38,613 --> 00:26:41,464
But you're not yourself,
Leopold.

535
00:26:41,533 --> 00:26:43,383
She makes me happy.

536
00:26:43,452 --> 00:26:45,719
As you know very well,

537
00:26:45,787 --> 00:26:49,406
royals don't have the luxury
of such frivolities.

538
00:26:49,641 --> 00:26:51,007
You and father were happy.

539
00:26:51,076 --> 00:26:52,541
Not at first.

540
00:26:52,778 --> 00:26:55,612
Fortunately our parents knew
what was best for us.

541
00:26:55,681 --> 00:26:57,380
Not only did our peerage match,

542
00:26:57,449 --> 00:27:00,533
but we developed a deep affinity
for each other.

543
00:27:00,602 --> 00:27:03,503
A deep affinity. Wow.

544
00:27:03,571 --> 00:27:05,087
That's romantic.

545
00:27:05,156 --> 00:27:07,624
Natasha is from a noble family.

546
00:27:07,693 --> 00:27:09,926
You have everything in common.

547
00:27:09,994 --> 00:27:11,044
Except feelings.

548
00:27:11,113 --> 00:27:12,512
When did you last see her?

549
00:27:12,580 --> 00:27:13,813
I don't remember.

550
00:27:13,949 --> 00:27:16,382
Two years ago
at the Christmas Ball.

551
00:27:16,451 --> 00:27:20,386
She's far more accomplished now.
More beautiful, more elegant.

552
00:27:20,455 --> 00:27:21,938
No doubt.

553
00:27:22,007 --> 00:27:23,740
[sighs]
Leopold...

554
00:27:23,808 --> 00:27:26,526
I'm just trying to save you both
from terrible heartbreak.

555
00:27:26,762 --> 00:27:28,728
As much as you both
believe otherwise,

556
00:27:28,930 --> 00:27:30,480
that girl comes from
a different world.

557
00:27:30,716 --> 00:27:32,682
She'll never be able
to fit into ours.

558
00:27:32,751 --> 00:27:35,802
And I really sewn him
to the tablecloth!

559
00:27:35,871 --> 00:27:38,304
[giggling]

560
00:27:38,373 --> 00:27:39,889
- Good morning!
- Morning.

561
00:27:39,958 --> 00:27:41,574
Hi.

562
00:27:41,643 --> 00:27:43,459
Oh, wow.

563
00:27:43,528 --> 00:27:44,527
I'm really underdressed.

564
00:27:44,780 --> 00:27:46,162
That's not important.

565
00:27:46,231 --> 00:27:47,514
Should I change my clothes?

566
00:27:47,582 --> 00:27:48,865
As if that would help.

567
00:27:48,934 --> 00:27:50,233
You look great.

568
00:27:50,302 --> 00:27:54,420
In fact, I can't wait to get out
of this monkey suit.

569
00:27:54,489 --> 00:27:57,057
I trust your room
was adequate.

570
00:27:57,126 --> 00:27:58,491
Oh, it's beautiful.

571
00:27:58,761 --> 00:28:00,527
It's like a postcard.
Thank you.

572
00:28:00,595 --> 00:28:02,579
I'm gonna take Emily into town
this afternoon.

573
00:28:02,648 --> 00:28:06,099
But the ball is in two days,
and we have a dinner tonight.

574
00:28:06,168 --> 00:28:07,200
Your schedule is full.

575
00:28:07,268 --> 00:28:10,870
Surely I can have one afternoon
to show Emily around.

576
00:28:10,939 --> 00:28:12,839
Would you care to join us,
Your Majesty?

577
00:28:12,908 --> 00:28:15,008
As tempting
as that might sound,

578
00:28:15,077 --> 00:28:18,845
I can't just dash off on a whim
and toodle around town.

579
00:28:18,914 --> 00:28:20,947
Don't worry.
We'll be back in plenty of time

580
00:28:21,015 --> 00:28:24,600
to embarrass you
in front of your dinner guests.

581
00:28:24,669 --> 00:28:26,669
I have no doubt about that.

582
00:28:30,042 --> 00:28:31,908
Morning, gentlemen.

583
00:28:31,977 --> 00:28:34,527
Go, Phillies!

584
00:28:34,595 --> 00:28:36,830
Are you sure
they're not robots?

585
00:28:36,898 --> 00:28:38,231
There's only one way
to find out.

586
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:41,501
<i> You make me wanna move </i>

587
00:28:41,569 --> 00:28:44,804
<i> You make me wanna move </i>

588
00:28:44,873 --> 00:28:47,373
<i> You make me wanna groove </i>

589
00:28:47,442 --> 00:28:48,691
Selfie!

590
00:28:48,761 --> 00:28:52,244
<i> You make me wanna move </i>

591
00:28:52,431 --> 00:28:53,847
<i> You make me groove
make me play </i>

592
00:28:53,915 --> 00:28:55,665
<i> Make me rock
and make me sway </i>

593
00:28:55,684 --> 00:28:58,568
<i> Gotta do it night and day
Yeah </i>

594
00:28:58,637 --> 00:29:02,038
Nothing? Really?
[sighs]

595
00:29:02,107 --> 00:29:04,774
We'll get you next time.
We're coming back.

596
00:29:04,843 --> 00:29:07,877
- That was good.
- [giggles]

597
00:29:07,946 --> 00:29:10,647
Thanks, Ivan,
but I think I'll drive today.

598
00:29:10,716 --> 00:29:14,251
- Yes, Your Royal Highness.
- Come on.

599
00:29:33,037 --> 00:29:36,406
- You going incognito?
- It's just easier.

600
00:29:36,475 --> 00:29:38,375
You're like a rock star.

601
00:29:38,443 --> 00:29:41,594
Yeah, just with
no discernible talent.

602
00:29:41,730 --> 00:29:44,130
You waltz, you fence,
you make pancakes.

603
00:29:51,657 --> 00:29:53,556
What are they actually for?

604
00:29:53,624 --> 00:29:56,076
- To protect me.
- From what?

605
00:29:56,144 --> 00:29:57,643
From people who don't like
my mother.

606
00:29:57,712 --> 00:30:00,880
Oh. I get it now.
They gonna follow us everywhere?

607
00:30:00,949 --> 00:30:01,765
Yep.

608
00:30:01,833 --> 00:30:03,032
- Restaurants?
- Yep.

609
00:30:03,101 --> 00:30:04,784
- Bathroom?
- Me, yes. You, no.

610
00:30:04,852 --> 00:30:06,686
- Oh, good.
- You get used to it.

611
00:30:06,754 --> 00:30:08,388
Though I have to say,
it was rather nice

612
00:30:08,457 --> 00:30:10,156
not having them around
in Philly.

613
00:30:10,225 --> 00:30:11,491
Made me feel so...

614
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:13,426
- Common?
- [laughs]

615
00:30:13,495 --> 00:30:16,196
I was gonna say "free."

616
00:30:20,952 --> 00:30:24,087
Ah. This one looks like
it's still growing.

617
00:30:24,156 --> 00:30:26,957
Aw. My Dad and I have
this Christmas tradition

618
00:30:27,025 --> 00:30:29,993
where we would try and find
the scrawniest tree,

619
00:30:30,062 --> 00:30:32,194
the one that needed
to be loved the most.

620
00:30:32,263 --> 00:30:34,196
I never thought of it that way.

621
00:30:34,265 --> 00:30:36,950
Well, it was just his way
of making the tree special

622
00:30:37,018 --> 00:30:39,903
instead of telling me
it was all we could afford.

623
00:30:39,971 --> 00:30:42,355
That's nice.

624
00:30:42,424 --> 00:30:44,340
Would you like to buy a tree?

625
00:30:44,409 --> 00:30:46,543
- Can we?
- Of course.

626
00:30:46,611 --> 00:30:47,961
I'm Poppy.

627
00:30:48,029 --> 00:30:50,230
Well, hello, Poppy.
That's a pretty name.

628
00:30:50,299 --> 00:30:52,432
This is Leo, and I'm Emily.

629
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:54,534
Do you go to school
at St. Francis?

630
00:30:54,602 --> 00:30:56,602
Yes, and I live there too.

631
00:30:56,888 --> 00:30:59,339
St. Francis is an orphanage.

632
00:30:59,408 --> 00:31:01,174
Oh, I see.

633
00:31:01,243 --> 00:31:04,260
I'm only there until I can find
a permanent family.

634
00:31:05,914 --> 00:31:08,581
Well, I'm sure you're
gonna find the perfect one,

635
00:31:08,650 --> 00:31:10,182
and hopefully very soon.

636
00:31:10,251 --> 00:31:12,736
Yep! I'm not too picky.

637
00:31:12,804 --> 00:31:14,720
[laughs]
I grew up without a mom.

638
00:31:14,789 --> 00:31:16,489
I know how hard that can be.

639
00:31:16,558 --> 00:31:19,475
So you're half an orphan?

640
00:31:19,544 --> 00:31:22,295
Well, I suppose I am.

641
00:31:22,364 --> 00:31:26,315
But you turned out okay, right?

642
00:31:26,384 --> 00:31:28,334
She did indeed.

643
00:31:28,403 --> 00:31:30,669
And you will too.

644
00:31:30,738 --> 00:31:32,254
You know what?

645
00:31:32,323 --> 00:31:38,094
My best friend Toni gave me
this friendship bracelet, and...

646
00:31:38,162 --> 00:31:41,330
I would like
to give it to you.

647
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:44,284
Thank you!

648
00:31:44,352 --> 00:31:46,386
You too, Prince Leopold.

649
00:31:46,455 --> 00:31:49,539
So much for incognito.

650
00:31:49,608 --> 00:31:53,009
Would it be possible
to buy all the trees

651
00:31:53,078 --> 00:31:55,094
so that we can donate them
back to the town?

652
00:31:55,163 --> 00:31:57,380
Wow. Thank you.

653
00:31:57,532 --> 00:31:59,265
Sister Agnes!
Sister Agnes, look!

654
00:31:59,334 --> 00:32:03,303
Wow. So this Prince Leo guy
is a pretty nice guy, huh?

655
00:32:03,371 --> 00:32:06,589
He is, as far as princes go.

656
00:32:06,658 --> 00:32:08,959
I don't really know
that many princes,

657
00:32:09,027 --> 00:32:12,095
but I'd say you're in
like the top 2%.

658
00:32:12,164 --> 00:32:13,896
Why not the top 1%?

659
00:32:13,999 --> 00:32:16,282
Well, you'd have to do
more princely deeds.

660
00:32:16,351 --> 00:32:20,753
Okay, um, does this count?

661
00:32:20,822 --> 00:32:23,005
- He's right over there!
- Prince Leopold!

662
00:32:23,074 --> 00:32:26,659
Oh, my goodness!
You bought all the trees!

663
00:32:26,895 --> 00:32:28,861
Thank you!
Thank you so much!

664
00:32:29,064 --> 00:32:31,881
- Very nice to meet you.
- Excuse me.

665
00:32:31,949 --> 00:32:34,567
- Merry Christmas.
- Pardon me.

666
00:32:34,635 --> 00:32:36,419
[chatter continues]

667
00:32:36,488 --> 00:32:40,856
LEO: Oh, and you.
Merry Christmas.

668
00:32:44,246 --> 00:32:46,478
I mean it'll be cute
once we decorate it.

669
00:32:46,547 --> 00:32:47,546
Definitely.

670
00:32:47,615 --> 00:32:49,082
Get some lights,
some ornaments.

671
00:32:49,150 --> 00:32:51,751
- Little mini Christmas tree.
- Where have you been?

672
00:32:51,820 --> 00:32:54,504
Oh, we just went into town,
then the vineyard,

673
00:32:54,572 --> 00:32:56,639
then a few museums
and the lake.

674
00:32:56,707 --> 00:32:58,458
Yeah, we kinda
lost track of time.

675
00:32:58,527 --> 00:33:00,610
Well, you better hurry
and change.

676
00:33:00,678 --> 00:33:02,962
People will be here
very soon.

677
00:33:03,030 --> 00:33:04,580
- What's that?
- Oh, it's a--

678
00:33:04,850 --> 00:33:07,099
Oh, never mind.
Victor!

679
00:33:07,168 --> 00:33:10,720
Will you please have this
taken to someplace special.

680
00:33:10,788 --> 00:33:12,355
Of course.

681
00:33:20,165 --> 00:33:21,864
I think she's warming up to me.

682
00:33:21,933 --> 00:33:24,016
She'll come around.
Just give her time.

683
00:33:24,018 --> 00:33:26,136
I don't think
I have that many years left.

684
00:33:26,204 --> 00:33:29,205
Where do you suppose this
"someplace special" is?

685
00:33:29,274 --> 00:33:30,540
The composter.

686
00:33:30,608 --> 00:33:32,575
First it was my snow globe,
then it was the tree.

687
00:33:32,644 --> 00:33:35,211
You don't think I'm gonna end up
in someplace special, do you?

688
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:37,780
And have you ever noticed how
she makes absolutely no sound

689
00:33:37,849 --> 00:33:39,015
when she approaches?

690
00:33:39,084 --> 00:33:40,517
She's like a cat or a ninja.

691
00:33:40,585 --> 00:33:43,285
Do you think we could not
talk about my mother?

692
00:33:43,354 --> 00:33:46,172
I would love to not
talk about your mother.

693
00:33:46,241 --> 00:33:48,657
Oh, Leopold!

694
00:33:48,894 --> 00:33:52,745
I have missed you so much.

695
00:33:52,813 --> 00:33:56,266
Uh, I didn't expect you
to be here.

696
00:33:56,334 --> 00:33:57,484
Don't be silly.

697
00:33:57,552 --> 00:33:59,585
Your mother invited me,
like she does every year.

698
00:33:59,654 --> 00:34:03,072
Ah, Mother.

699
00:34:03,141 --> 00:34:05,825
Emily, this is Natasha.
Natasha, Emily.

700
00:34:05,894 --> 00:34:08,695
How spectacularly unexpected

701
00:34:08,763 --> 00:34:11,647
to meet the girl
who stole my Leopold's heart.

702
00:34:11,716 --> 00:34:13,967
Thank you, I think.

703
00:34:14,035 --> 00:34:15,835
Natasha's an old family friend.

704
00:34:16,004 --> 00:34:18,087
Well, we did go out for a bit.

705
00:34:18,256 --> 00:34:20,706
Although, as I recall,
we mostly stayed in.

706
00:34:20,775 --> 00:34:23,209
Only because
we weren't allowed out.

707
00:34:23,277 --> 00:34:25,611
So how long have you two
known each other?

708
00:34:25,847 --> 00:34:27,814
- About a year.
- Oh, how sweet.

709
00:34:28,133 --> 00:34:29,982
So this is your first
Christmas together.

710
00:34:30,051 --> 00:34:31,117
Yeah.

711
00:34:31,319 --> 00:34:33,603
Last year was the first
Christmas Leopold and I

712
00:34:33,672 --> 00:34:34,987
spent apart.

713
00:34:35,056 --> 00:34:37,890
Well, that's a lot
of Christmases.

714
00:34:37,959 --> 00:34:40,109
We've known each other
since birth pretty much.

715
00:34:40,178 --> 00:34:42,511
We've grew up
doing everything together.

716
00:34:42,781 --> 00:34:45,114
Well, not quite everything.

717
00:34:45,183 --> 00:34:47,099
Well, we did get into
a lot of trouble.

718
00:34:47,235 --> 00:34:50,019
Do you remember that one time
we snuck past your security

719
00:34:50,087 --> 00:34:51,120
when we climbed
the palace wall?

720
00:34:51,289 --> 00:34:54,090
Yeah. The looks
on the guards' faces...

721
00:34:54,158 --> 00:34:56,159
After they caught us
skinny-dipping.

722
00:34:56,227 --> 00:35:00,146
[laughter]

723
00:35:02,783 --> 00:35:04,983
I'm gonna go change.

724
00:35:05,052 --> 00:35:08,087
Yeah. I should go too.

725
00:35:08,156 --> 00:35:10,440
I look forward to catching up.

726
00:35:20,668 --> 00:35:23,602
Emily, can I help you?

727
00:35:23,872 --> 00:35:25,455
If only.

728
00:35:26,791 --> 00:35:28,825
I take it you met the duchess.

729
00:35:28,893 --> 00:35:30,627
No. She's a duchess?

730
00:35:30,695 --> 00:35:33,362
The Duchess of Warren.

731
00:35:33,431 --> 00:35:37,550
Great. The unmarried
Duchess of Warren?

732
00:35:37,619 --> 00:35:39,752
I'm afraid so.

733
00:35:42,474 --> 00:35:44,807
Oh, this is lovely.

734
00:35:44,876 --> 00:35:47,459
Thank you. I thought it was
when I made it.

735
00:35:47,528 --> 00:35:50,729
- You made this?
- Yeah. I made all of them.

736
00:35:50,798 --> 00:35:53,215
You know, I thought they were
nice and appropriate,

737
00:35:53,284 --> 00:35:56,319
but now they just seem
so unroyal.

738
00:36:00,141 --> 00:36:02,758
Let's go with this one.

739
00:36:04,596 --> 00:36:08,314
You know, she's pretty,
but you are beautiful.

740
00:36:08,382 --> 00:36:12,017
Thank you, Olivia.
You're the best.

741
00:36:15,039 --> 00:36:17,607
You ready, Emily?

742
00:36:17,675 --> 00:36:18,974
Yeah, almost!

743
00:36:19,043 --> 00:36:21,461
Okay, let's go.

744
00:36:21,529 --> 00:36:23,846
And then the chandelier fell!

745
00:36:24,082 --> 00:36:26,716
[laughter]

746
00:36:26,785 --> 00:36:28,767
Good evening.

747
00:36:28,836 --> 00:36:31,754
Shall I make
the introductions?

748
00:36:31,823 --> 00:36:35,123
The Baron and Baroness
of Newberry,

749
00:36:35,192 --> 00:36:38,344
you do know
the Duchess Natasha,

750
00:36:38,413 --> 00:36:41,129
and the Count and Countess
of Exeter,

751
00:36:41,198 --> 00:36:43,116
the Count and Countess
of Surrey,

752
00:36:43,184 --> 00:36:45,684
and the Count and Countess
of Devon.

753
00:36:45,753 --> 00:36:47,136
[whispering]
I've lost count.

754
00:36:47,204 --> 00:36:49,639
Just nod and smile.
That's what I do.

755
00:36:49,707 --> 00:36:53,075
Emily Taylor from...

756
00:36:53,144 --> 00:36:56,311
South Philadelphia. Hi.
It's very nice to meet you.

757
00:36:56,380 --> 00:36:59,415
Leo, I would like you
to sit beside Natasha.

758
00:36:59,483 --> 00:37:04,203
And, Emily, I would like you
to sit beside the baroness.

759
00:37:10,345 --> 00:37:12,745
Could you have sat her
any further away?

760
00:37:12,814 --> 00:37:15,097
There's a table
in the kitchen.

761
00:37:18,436 --> 00:37:23,389
So, Natasha, how long
are you staying here for?

762
00:37:23,458 --> 00:37:25,742
Your mother's invited me
to stay through the holidays.

763
00:37:25,810 --> 00:37:27,443
Or beyond if need be.

764
00:37:27,511 --> 00:37:30,513
The Christmas ball wouldn't be
the same without Natasha.

765
00:37:30,581 --> 00:37:32,231
Thank you, Isadora.

766
00:37:32,300 --> 00:37:35,368
My fondest holidays have been
spent with you and Leopold.

767
00:37:35,436 --> 00:37:39,038
Last Christmas just wasn't
the same without you.

768
00:37:39,106 --> 00:37:41,574
He's going to make it up
this Christmas.

769
00:37:41,642 --> 00:37:43,793
Apparently I already am.

770
00:37:43,861 --> 00:37:45,628
Oh, please.

771
00:37:59,093 --> 00:38:01,911
- Third fork to the left.
- Thank you.

772
00:38:01,979 --> 00:38:08,100
Galina told me the other day
that she's publishing a book.

773
00:38:08,169 --> 00:38:10,453
Not a tell-all, I hope.

774
00:38:10,521 --> 00:38:12,972
Actually,
it's a children's book.

775
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:15,307
Wow! Congratulations.

776
00:38:15,376 --> 00:38:17,459
That's wonderful.
Were your children

777
00:38:17,528 --> 00:38:20,580
the inspiration
for the book?

778
00:38:20,648 --> 00:38:22,281
Unfortunately not.

779
00:38:22,350 --> 00:38:27,019
Having children is not
in the cards for us.

780
00:38:27,088 --> 00:38:28,521
I'm so sorry.

781
00:38:29,874 --> 00:38:33,442
Truly, I... I'm sorry.

782
00:38:33,511 --> 00:38:37,630
Tell us, Emily, how do you
occupy your time in America?

783
00:38:37,698 --> 00:38:40,799
Oh, Emily comes from
a long line of tailors.

784
00:38:40,868 --> 00:38:43,169
She works at her father's shop.

785
00:38:43,237 --> 00:38:45,921
Yes, it's actually
where Leo and I met.

786
00:38:45,990 --> 00:38:47,489
He came in
for a missing button,

787
00:38:47,558 --> 00:38:50,660
and I needled him
into asking me out.

788
00:38:50,728 --> 00:38:53,879
Well, how refreshing.
You have a trade.

789
00:38:53,948 --> 00:38:55,598
It pays the bills.

790
00:38:55,667 --> 00:38:58,451
She's also a very talented
clothes designer.

791
00:38:58,519 --> 00:39:00,603
Leo looks great
in all of my clothes.

792
00:39:01,973 --> 00:39:03,890
Well, I don't mean my clothes.

793
00:39:04,041 --> 00:39:05,808
I mean he just looks great
in everything.

794
00:39:06,043 --> 00:39:07,409
And even my father thinks so,

795
00:39:07,478 --> 00:39:10,029
and he thinks everyone
needs alterations.

796
00:39:10,098 --> 00:39:11,864
Emily's father and I
have become very close.

797
00:39:11,933 --> 00:39:14,166
Yeah, which is kind of amazing
because he never approves

798
00:39:14,235 --> 00:39:16,435
of anyone I go out with.

799
00:39:16,437 --> 00:39:18,354
Oh, how many have there been?

800
00:39:18,423 --> 00:39:22,308
Oh, no, not that many.
Like six.

801
00:39:22,376 --> 00:39:27,496
I mean, like four...
or two.

802
00:39:36,941 --> 00:39:39,057
Mmm!

803
00:39:39,127 --> 00:39:41,293
This soup is delicious.

804
00:39:41,362 --> 00:39:44,379
That is the finger bowl.

805
00:39:52,473 --> 00:39:54,674
No, I can't say
or do anything right.

806
00:39:54,742 --> 00:39:56,259
I am a total loser.

807
00:39:56,327 --> 00:39:57,593
You're not a loser.

808
00:39:57,661 --> 00:39:59,044
No, I am here.

809
00:39:59,113 --> 00:40:01,463
Oh, and his ex-girlfriend
is here.

810
00:40:01,532 --> 00:40:03,983
Mm-hmm.
And she's hot.

811
00:40:04,051 --> 00:40:05,834
Okay, but you're hot.

812
00:40:05,903 --> 00:40:07,836
Anyway she's old news, right?

813
00:40:07,905 --> 00:40:09,121
Not old enough.

814
00:40:09,190 --> 00:40:10,756
What did she have
that you don't?

815
00:40:10,825 --> 00:40:15,645
I don't know. Royal parents,
a title and a fortune.

816
00:40:15,713 --> 00:40:17,362
Yikes.

817
00:40:17,532 --> 00:40:18,881
- [knocking]
- Oh, I gotta go.

818
00:40:18,949 --> 00:40:21,651
- That is my ladies' maid.
- Ladies' maid?

819
00:40:21,719 --> 00:40:25,370
Please send send her
to our apartment.

820
00:40:25,439 --> 00:40:28,758
- I love you.
- Love you back. Bye.

821
00:40:28,826 --> 00:40:31,043
Come on in, Olivia!

822
00:40:31,111 --> 00:40:33,112
[tooting fanfare]

823
00:40:33,180 --> 00:40:35,515
No, no, no, no!
Please, please don't look!

824
00:40:35,583 --> 00:40:38,951
- I look hideous!
- I like your hideous look.

825
00:40:39,220 --> 00:40:41,604
- Really?
- Really.

826
00:40:41,673 --> 00:40:45,691
You still wanna talk to me
after last night?

827
00:40:45,759 --> 00:40:48,427
It wasn't that bad.

828
00:40:49,380 --> 00:40:50,863
All right,
it was a little bad,

829
00:40:50,932 --> 00:40:53,115
but I'm sure everyone's
forgotten it by now.

830
00:40:53,184 --> 00:40:55,784
Well, that's nice 'cause
I'll be reliving it every day

831
00:40:55,853 --> 00:40:57,570
for the rest of my life.

832
00:40:57,639 --> 00:41:01,023
I love you
just the way you are.

833
00:41:01,092 --> 00:41:04,460
Even with all my
unsuitable qualities?

834
00:41:04,529 --> 00:41:08,014
Even with your blue alien face.

835
00:41:08,082 --> 00:41:10,165
It's a beauty mask.

836
00:41:10,234 --> 00:41:13,318
Come. Your short stack, madam.

837
00:41:13,387 --> 00:41:16,872
- Did you make these?
- Yup.

838
00:41:17,174 --> 00:41:18,724
You did not.

839
00:41:18,792 --> 00:41:22,828
All right, the chef did,
but I supervised.

840
00:41:22,897 --> 00:41:25,598
You know, I should get you to
feel sorry for me more often.

841
00:41:25,666 --> 00:41:27,983
It's you who should be
feeling sorry for me.

842
00:41:28,052 --> 00:41:30,285
Mother's scheduled me every
minute from now until Christmas.

843
00:41:30,354 --> 00:41:32,404
Well, you have
responsibilities.

844
00:41:32,473 --> 00:41:35,140
Yeah. That's one way
of putting it.

845
00:41:36,410 --> 00:41:39,511
Wait. That looks
suspiciously like coffee.

846
00:41:39,647 --> 00:41:42,614
Smuggled in
from the staff kitchen.

847
00:41:42,683 --> 00:41:45,717
Thank you. I don't think
I can take another drop of tea.

848
00:41:45,786 --> 00:41:48,187
I've always hated it.
Cheers.

849
00:41:48,256 --> 00:41:49,738
So before you go,
Your Majesty,

850
00:41:49,807 --> 00:41:51,540
shall I go over
your schedule?

851
00:41:51,609 --> 00:41:52,792
Shall I go over yours?

852
00:41:52,860 --> 00:41:55,327
- I think we both know mine.
- Proceed.

853
00:41:55,396 --> 00:41:58,630
Your ride at 10:00, followed by
the royal procession.

854
00:41:58,699 --> 00:42:00,199
Tomorrow the benediction
at 11:00,

855
00:42:00,334 --> 00:42:02,134
statue dedication at noon,

856
00:42:02,203 --> 00:42:05,237
groundbreaking ceremony for the
new children's hospital at 1:00,

857
00:42:05,306 --> 00:42:07,205
embassy signing at 3:00.

858
00:42:07,274 --> 00:42:11,060
Yes, yes, but have the flowers
for the ball been delivered yet?

859
00:42:11,128 --> 00:42:14,229
Red and green.
More red than green.

860
00:42:14,298 --> 00:42:17,566
I thought I told you
to get rid of this.

861
00:42:17,635 --> 00:42:20,636
No, you told me to put it
someplace special.

862
00:42:20,704 --> 00:42:24,156
And by someplace special,
I meant in the charity bin.

863
00:42:24,225 --> 00:42:25,957
I must have misunderstood.

864
00:42:26,026 --> 00:42:27,927
I highly doubt that.

865
00:42:27,995 --> 00:42:30,162
You like her, don't you?

866
00:42:30,231 --> 00:42:32,397
She has a certain way.

867
00:42:32,399 --> 00:42:34,667
Could you be more
noncommittal?

868
00:42:34,735 --> 00:42:37,603
There are others
I like less.

869
00:42:37,672 --> 00:42:39,004
Hmph.

870
00:42:39,072 --> 00:42:41,840
And who and who would that be,
besides me at this moment?

871
00:42:41,909 --> 00:42:44,893
That list would occupy
most of the day, I'm afraid.

872
00:42:44,962 --> 00:42:47,212
Do you remember
my mother's lectures

873
00:42:47,281 --> 00:42:48,780
about choosing
the right partner?

874
00:42:48,849 --> 00:42:50,749
As if it were yesterday.

875
00:42:52,603 --> 00:42:54,803
I wanted to run away,
just like Leopold,

876
00:42:54,872 --> 00:42:57,456
but she wouldn't let me.

877
00:42:58,893 --> 00:43:04,663
This throne is far greater
than any one person's wishes.

878
00:43:04,732 --> 00:43:06,965
It's a thousand years
of history.

879
00:43:06,967 --> 00:43:09,034
History is past.

880
00:43:09,103 --> 00:43:11,504
But if we turn on our backs
on it, what's then?

881
00:43:11,572 --> 00:43:14,707
In a few years,
the only kings and queens

882
00:43:14,842 --> 00:43:18,177
will be found
in a deck of cards.

883
00:43:18,245 --> 00:43:20,412
Good morning, Your Majesty.

884
00:43:20,481 --> 00:43:23,499
Natasha, darling!

885
00:43:25,369 --> 00:43:27,836
Ah! Just look at you.

886
00:43:27,905 --> 00:43:30,756
You remind me of myself
when I was your age.

887
00:43:30,824 --> 00:43:32,040
Thank you.

888
00:43:32,109 --> 00:43:33,809
Perhaps that's the problem.

889
00:43:33,978 --> 00:43:37,028
What boy wants
to marry his mother?

890
00:43:37,097 --> 00:43:39,047
He needs time with you.

891
00:43:39,049 --> 00:43:43,485
It seems that he's forgotten
how perfectly suitable you are.

892
00:43:43,553 --> 00:43:45,571
I'll do my best to remind him.

893
00:43:45,639 --> 00:43:47,756
I'm sure you will.

894
00:43:47,825 --> 00:43:49,024
Shall we ride?

895
00:43:49,093 --> 00:43:50,359
Yes.

896
00:43:57,251 --> 00:43:59,819
There you are.
Mount up.

897
00:43:59,887 --> 00:44:02,537
Emily, will you not be
joining us for the morning ride?

898
00:44:02,606 --> 00:44:04,055
No. Just seeing you off.

899
00:44:04,124 --> 00:44:06,975
Emily doesn't know
how to ride, Mother.

900
00:44:07,044 --> 00:44:08,410
I believe I told you that.

901
00:44:10,014 --> 00:44:12,681
I'll see you
in a couple of hours.

902
00:44:12,749 --> 00:44:14,699
Or later.

903
00:44:14,768 --> 00:44:18,287
Come, Leo. Let's take
our favorite trail.

904
00:44:18,355 --> 00:44:20,022
[neighs]

905
00:44:31,135 --> 00:44:34,703
[laughter]

906
00:44:34,772 --> 00:44:36,739
- Go on.
- A strawberry and a kiwi

907
00:44:36,807 --> 00:44:39,140
run into each other
at the supermarket.

908
00:44:39,209 --> 00:44:42,027
And the strawberry said, "Look,
I'm in the shape of a heart."

909
00:44:42,163 --> 00:44:44,046
And then the kiwi said,

910
00:44:44,114 --> 00:44:47,015
"Would you please
change the subject?"

911
00:44:47,084 --> 00:44:49,718
[laughter]

912
00:44:49,787 --> 00:44:51,019
Hi.

913
00:44:51,088 --> 00:44:53,055
- How may I assist you?
- Oh, no, please, don't get up.

914
00:44:53,123 --> 00:44:55,023
Really, don't. Sit down.

915
00:44:55,092 --> 00:44:57,175
Thank you.

916
00:44:57,244 --> 00:44:58,543
You kept the tree.

917
00:44:58,780 --> 00:45:02,164
Oh, yes. We were just
about to decorate it.

918
00:45:02,483 --> 00:45:03,682
Would you join us
for a cup?

919
00:45:03,751 --> 00:45:05,768
I would love to.
Yeah, thanks.

920
00:45:07,672 --> 00:45:11,056
And maybe I could help you
decorate that little tree.

921
00:45:11,125 --> 00:45:12,124
Oh, yes.

922
00:45:13,778 --> 00:45:19,514
Hmm. Nine-letter word for
"small but beautiful."

923
00:45:19,583 --> 00:45:21,416
I don't know about you guys,
but this?

924
00:45:21,485 --> 00:45:23,619
This looks like
a royal Christmas tree.

925
00:45:23,788 --> 00:45:26,589
Yeah, I think
it's so beautiful.

926
00:45:26,657 --> 00:45:28,390
- Exquisite.
- Exquisite!

927
00:45:28,458 --> 00:45:31,176
That's it! Thank you!

928
00:45:31,245 --> 00:45:33,245
[laughter]

929
00:45:33,314 --> 00:45:35,831
I heard laughter.

930
00:45:35,900 --> 00:45:39,351
An unusual sound
for around here.

931
00:45:39,420 --> 00:45:40,852
May I help you, Baroness?

932
00:45:40,921 --> 00:45:44,056
Actually, I was
looking for Emily.

933
00:45:52,566 --> 00:45:55,667
I am so embarrassed about
last night, Baroness.

934
00:45:55,736 --> 00:45:58,537
If what I said hurt you.
I'm truly sorry.

935
00:45:58,606 --> 00:46:00,705
It's Galina,
and you did nothing wrong.

936
00:46:00,774 --> 00:46:02,975
Oh, I did everything wrong,

937
00:46:03,044 --> 00:46:05,878
but I do appreciate
you saying that.

938
00:46:05,946 --> 00:46:08,347
Left behind
on the morning ride?

939
00:46:08,415 --> 00:46:09,881
Yeah.

940
00:46:09,950 --> 00:46:13,835
I didn't learn to ride until
well after I'd met Kent.

941
00:46:13,904 --> 00:46:17,539
You know, it's not easy
fitting in with these people.

942
00:46:17,607 --> 00:46:20,475
Aren't these people
your people?

943
00:46:20,544 --> 00:46:21,944
They are now.

944
00:46:22,012 --> 00:46:24,613
When I first met
the Baron's family,

945
00:46:24,682 --> 00:46:26,581
I tried to greet them
in German.

946
00:46:26,818 --> 00:46:28,283
I ended up calling them thieves

947
00:46:28,352 --> 00:46:30,352
and breaking
a priceless Grecian urn.

948
00:46:30,420 --> 00:46:32,053
Really?

949
00:46:32,122 --> 00:46:35,557
Okay, that does make me feel
a little better.

950
00:46:35,626 --> 00:46:37,326
I'm going into town,

951
00:46:37,395 --> 00:46:40,996
which is my official excuse
to go Christmas shopping.

952
00:46:41,064 --> 00:46:43,365
Come with me?

953
00:46:43,434 --> 00:46:45,484
Sure.

954
00:46:50,458 --> 00:46:52,208
Thank you.

955
00:46:52,276 --> 00:46:54,910
It's kind of you
to get gifts for the staff.

956
00:46:54,979 --> 00:46:56,545
They're just little
stocking stuffers.

957
00:46:56,613 --> 00:46:58,780
It's the thought though,
isn't it?

958
00:46:59,917 --> 00:47:01,150
Emily!

959
00:47:01,302 --> 00:47:03,619
Oh, Poppy!

960
00:47:04,772 --> 00:47:06,038
Hi.

961
00:47:06,107 --> 00:47:09,675
I would like you to meet
the Baroness of Newberry.

962
00:47:09,743 --> 00:47:11,242
Greetings, milady.

963
00:47:11,311 --> 00:47:13,761
[laughs]
You can call me Galina.

964
00:47:13,830 --> 00:47:15,497
And how do you two
know each other?

965
00:47:15,566 --> 00:47:17,315
We're friends for life.

966
00:47:17,384 --> 00:47:18,867
Yes, we are.

967
00:47:18,936 --> 00:47:20,703
And how are you?
How are things?

968
00:47:20,771 --> 00:47:23,772
Well, Prince Leopold bought
all the Christmas trees,

969
00:47:23,840 --> 00:47:26,491
so now we just have
some wreaths to sell.

970
00:47:26,761 --> 00:47:27,843
I wish we had
more things to sell.

971
00:47:27,911 --> 00:47:30,179
We're almost out.

972
00:47:35,119 --> 00:47:36,584
You know what?

973
00:47:36,653 --> 00:47:38,686
You know, maybe I can help.

974
00:47:40,941 --> 00:47:43,008
QUEEN: The crowd seems
even smaller this year.

975
00:47:43,077 --> 00:47:44,977
LEO: They're probably
bored of us by now.

976
00:47:45,045 --> 00:47:49,682
Same clothes, same smiles,
same waves.

977
00:47:49,750 --> 00:47:52,751
Perhaps next year you could
ride in on a skateboard

978
00:47:52,820 --> 00:47:54,320
with a backwards-facing hat.

979
00:47:54,388 --> 00:47:57,222
I'm just saying
the world's different now.

980
00:47:57,291 --> 00:48:00,225
I'm different, but you
never want to talk about it.

981
00:48:00,294 --> 00:48:04,129
Yes, that's because this is
exactly the type of conversation

982
00:48:04,198 --> 00:48:08,133
I'd been hoping for
on our way to the benediction.

983
00:48:18,312 --> 00:48:19,761
Hold on.

984
00:48:20,481 --> 00:48:22,030
It's Emily.

985
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:31,573
Merry Christmas,
Your Majesty.

986
00:48:31,642 --> 00:48:34,176
It's a scarf for you.

987
00:48:34,244 --> 00:48:35,260
Thank you.

988
00:48:37,131 --> 00:48:41,533
Now, that's what I call
Christmas spirit.

989
00:48:51,161 --> 00:48:53,495
I'm sorry I have
so many obligations.

990
00:48:53,563 --> 00:48:55,030
Don't be sorry.

991
00:48:55,099 --> 00:48:58,466
It's not always like this.
You could come with us.

992
00:48:58,535 --> 00:49:01,302
- I'd be in your way.
- No, you wouldn't.

993
00:49:01,371 --> 00:49:03,038
Okay, I'd be
in your mother's way.

994
00:49:03,107 --> 00:49:06,508
Okay. After the ball tonight,
it's just us.

995
00:49:06,576 --> 00:49:07,843
And the old us.

996
00:49:07,911 --> 00:49:09,377
I miss those losers.

997
00:49:09,446 --> 00:49:11,579
Yeah, me too.

998
00:49:13,984 --> 00:49:16,818
This is my favorite spot.
You're gonna love it.

999
00:49:16,887 --> 00:49:18,654
Oh, wow.
It's beautiful.

1000
00:49:18,722 --> 00:49:21,706
It was built
in the 18th century.

1001
00:49:21,775 --> 00:49:23,742
So you have a church
and a cemetery.

1002
00:49:23,810 --> 00:49:26,645
Yep. You can get baptized,
married and buried

1003
00:49:26,713 --> 00:49:28,647
without ever having
to leave the grounds.

1004
00:49:28,715 --> 00:49:30,349
And hopefully
in that order.

1005
00:49:30,418 --> 00:49:31,650
Mm-hmm.

1006
00:49:31,718 --> 00:49:33,735
Unfortunately
all the royal weddings

1007
00:49:33,804 --> 00:49:37,039
are done in the Grand Cathedral,
which seats about 2,000.

1008
00:49:37,108 --> 00:49:39,824
I always thought
if I was to get married,

1009
00:49:39,894 --> 00:49:42,428
it'd be nice to do it here.

1010
00:49:42,496 --> 00:49:44,696
So you've thought
about getting married?

1011
00:49:44,899 --> 00:49:48,100
Well, on occasion.

1012
00:49:48,168 --> 00:49:49,734
You?

1013
00:49:49,803 --> 00:49:52,237
Oh, no, never.

1014
00:49:52,306 --> 00:49:53,938
Really?

1015
00:49:55,592 --> 00:49:58,710
Okay, maybe once or twice...

1016
00:49:58,779 --> 00:50:02,848
...a day since I was
eight years old.

1017
00:50:02,917 --> 00:50:06,802
You know, if we ever to,
you know,

1018
00:50:06,870 --> 00:50:08,804
we could do it anywhere.

1019
00:50:08,872 --> 00:50:10,305
I wouldn't care.

1020
00:50:10,374 --> 00:50:11,573
Me either.

1021
00:50:11,642 --> 00:50:13,492
Back of a tailor shop.

1022
00:50:13,561 --> 00:50:15,476
International House of Pancakes.

1023
00:50:15,713 --> 00:50:16,978
In matching hoodies.

1024
00:50:17,047 --> 00:50:19,031
Obviously.
And barefoot.

1025
00:50:20,618 --> 00:50:24,819
Look, I can be Prince Leopold.

1026
00:50:24,888 --> 00:50:27,122
And sometimes I'm good at it.

1027
00:50:27,191 --> 00:50:31,410
But you have to realize
that I'm still Leo from Philly.

1028
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:34,679
Hello! There you are.

1029
00:50:34,748 --> 00:50:36,448
Your mother sent me
to find you.

1030
00:50:36,516 --> 00:50:37,849
Of course she did.

1031
00:50:37,918 --> 00:50:41,386
Chop chop. You're due
at the royal unveiling.

1032
00:50:41,455 --> 00:50:43,888
I haven't been to this spot
in ages.

1033
00:50:43,957 --> 00:50:45,907
Since our pretend wedding.
Remember, Leo?

1034
00:50:45,976 --> 00:50:49,460
Oh! So you're
already married.

1035
00:50:49,529 --> 00:50:50,912
We were kids.

1036
00:50:51,115 --> 00:50:52,847
Leo gave me
the prettiest ring.

1037
00:50:52,916 --> 00:50:54,499
- He made it himself.
- Really?

1038
00:50:54,567 --> 00:50:57,519
No, no. It was nothing.
It was just a piece of straw.

1039
00:50:57,588 --> 00:51:00,371
And I still have it.

1040
00:51:02,242 --> 00:51:03,775
Uh...

1041
00:51:11,886 --> 00:51:15,470
Oh, Natasha, darling,
I see you found them.

1042
00:51:15,539 --> 00:51:19,324
Emily, do you have your gown
for tonight's ball?

1043
00:51:19,393 --> 00:51:20,825
I did bring something.

1044
00:51:20,894 --> 00:51:23,495
Yes, I'm sure you did, but I
have the perfect dress for you.

1045
00:51:23,564 --> 00:51:26,998
I wore it to the Christmas ball
the year that I got engaged.

1046
00:51:27,067 --> 00:51:29,735
- Wow.
- Well, it's timeless.

1047
00:51:29,803 --> 00:51:31,186
Thank you, Your Majesty,

1048
00:51:31,255 --> 00:51:33,121
but we're probably
totally different sizes.

1049
00:51:33,190 --> 00:51:34,656
I'm sure you can
make it work.

1050
00:51:34,725 --> 00:51:36,174
You are a seamstress,
aren't you?

1051
00:51:36,243 --> 00:51:39,010
I'll have it sent up
to your room.

1052
00:51:42,883 --> 00:51:45,384
- Sorry.
- It's okay.

1053
00:51:46,420 --> 00:51:47,903
Oh, dear me.

1054
00:51:47,972 --> 00:51:49,771
Okay, so I'll see you
in a couple of hours?

1055
00:51:49,840 --> 00:51:51,272
- Okay.
- Yeah?

1056
00:51:51,341 --> 00:51:53,208
Don't do anything
I wouldn't do.

1057
00:51:53,276 --> 00:51:54,209
Love you.

1058
00:51:54,277 --> 00:51:55,310
You too.

1059
00:52:15,816 --> 00:52:18,116
Look! A $100 bill!

1060
00:52:19,553 --> 00:52:22,387
$100? No?
Nothing.

1061
00:52:22,456 --> 00:52:23,455
Wow.

1062
00:52:28,362 --> 00:52:29,427
Hey, Victor.

1063
00:52:29,496 --> 00:52:31,997
Priceless tapestries
line these walls,

1064
00:52:32,065 --> 00:52:35,050
but many are
filled with holes.

1065
00:52:35,118 --> 00:52:37,786
I don't see any holes.

1066
00:52:38,021 --> 00:52:39,938
They're there.

1067
00:52:42,059 --> 00:52:43,591
Thank you, Victor.

1068
00:52:45,195 --> 00:52:49,481
Actually, Victor,
could I ask you a favor?

1069
00:52:51,534 --> 00:52:53,601
Coffee?
A hot dog perhaps?

1070
00:52:53,670 --> 00:52:56,071
No. I...

1071
00:52:56,140 --> 00:52:59,440
I'd like you to prepare me
for the ball.

1072
00:52:59,509 --> 00:53:01,827
I'm not sure
we have time enough for that.

1073
00:53:01,895 --> 00:53:03,445
Well, we have all day.

1074
00:53:03,514 --> 00:53:05,313
We'd need all year.

1075
00:53:06,983 --> 00:53:09,418
You might be surprised.

1076
00:53:09,486 --> 00:53:11,053
I believe I might be.

1077
00:53:11,121 --> 00:53:13,137
Follow me.

1078
00:53:14,675 --> 00:53:17,275
Now pretend I'm
the Grand Duke of Canterbury.

1079
00:53:17,344 --> 00:53:18,543
How do you do?

1080
00:53:18,612 --> 00:53:20,045
No, don't reach.

1081
00:53:20,180 --> 00:53:21,980
Hello, Grand Duke.

1082
00:53:22,049 --> 00:53:23,648
That's quite a grip.

1083
00:53:23,951 --> 00:53:25,016
Thank you.

1084
00:53:25,085 --> 00:53:27,519
It wasn't a compliment.

1085
00:53:40,784 --> 00:53:42,851
Very good.

1086
00:53:42,919 --> 00:53:45,420
Now, just like that.

1087
00:53:45,489 --> 00:53:49,841
The trick is to move briskly
and with aplomb.

1088
00:53:49,909 --> 00:53:51,459
Look at this.

1089
00:53:51,528 --> 00:53:54,328
I'm doing it.
I'm totally waltzing.

1090
00:53:54,397 --> 00:53:56,731
Now triple time.

1091
00:53:56,800 --> 00:53:58,299
- Triple time?
- Here we go.

1092
00:53:58,368 --> 00:54:00,101
One two three,
one, two, three.

1093
00:54:00,170 --> 00:54:03,438
One two three,
one, two, three.

1094
00:54:03,506 --> 00:54:05,006
Let's go on to basics,
shall we?

1095
00:54:05,075 --> 00:54:06,308
Yes, please.

1096
00:54:18,322 --> 00:54:20,739
Now the curtsy.

1097
00:54:20,808 --> 00:54:22,023
Watch me.

1098
00:54:25,129 --> 00:54:27,362
Whenever it's a princess,
you always curtsy.

1099
00:54:27,430 --> 00:54:29,981
Under no circumstances
is there any touching,

1100
00:54:30,049 --> 00:54:31,683
hugging or handshaking.

1101
00:54:31,918 --> 00:54:33,084
Deal.

1102
00:54:33,153 --> 00:54:34,803
Deal?

1103
00:54:34,871 --> 00:54:36,555
Was that a high-five?

1104
00:54:36,623 --> 00:54:37,972
Yes, it was.

1105
00:54:38,041 --> 00:54:39,624
My first one.

1106
00:54:39,693 --> 00:54:42,226
[laughter]

1107
00:54:43,730 --> 00:54:45,563
The canaps.

1108
00:54:45,632 --> 00:54:46,848
Stop.

1109
00:54:46,917 --> 00:54:49,017
Gloves off for eating.

1110
00:54:50,487 --> 00:54:51,536
No, no.

1111
00:54:51,605 --> 00:54:54,105
You're not a gardener.
You must do it discreetly.

1112
00:54:54,842 --> 00:54:56,692
Okay.

1113
00:54:56,760 --> 00:54:58,960
Very good.

1114
00:55:00,213 --> 00:55:02,631
Now, come on.
Lots of work to do.

1115
00:55:02,699 --> 00:55:04,766
Mmm! Really good.

1116
00:55:04,835 --> 00:55:06,768
Emily?

1117
00:55:06,837 --> 00:55:08,970
Coming!

1118
00:55:22,703 --> 00:55:26,338
[applause]

1119
00:55:29,075 --> 00:55:31,976
And finally the gown.

1120
00:55:32,045 --> 00:55:33,411
Wait.

1121
00:55:33,480 --> 00:55:36,114
This is the dress
the queen wants me to wear?

1122
00:55:36,182 --> 00:55:38,550
I'm afraid so.

1123
00:55:38,618 --> 00:55:41,369
This is gonna need
a lot of work.

1124
00:55:41,437 --> 00:55:46,191
If we're gonna make it to the
ball on time, we better hurry.

1125
00:55:46,326 --> 00:55:48,025
VICTOR: Ah, there you are, sir.

1126
00:55:48,095 --> 00:55:49,860
I've been looking all over
for you.

1127
00:55:49,929 --> 00:55:51,563
The guests will be here soon.

1128
00:55:51,631 --> 00:55:55,467
Victor, you've known me
all my life.

1129
00:55:55,535 --> 00:55:56,801
That I have.

1130
00:55:56,869 --> 00:56:00,922
Have you ever seen me happier
than I am with Emily?

1131
00:56:00,991 --> 00:56:02,757
That I have not.

1132
00:56:02,825 --> 00:56:04,759
Good.

1133
00:56:04,827 --> 00:56:06,895
Um...

1134
00:56:06,963 --> 00:56:10,732
I'm going to propose to her
tonight after the ball.

1135
00:56:10,801 --> 00:56:14,686
I must say that makes me
very happy as well.

1136
00:56:16,706 --> 00:56:18,506
I thought it might.

1137
00:56:20,477 --> 00:56:23,878
I just wish Mother
could be happy for me.

1138
00:56:24,114 --> 00:56:27,215
It's not forbidden to dream.

1139
00:56:52,726 --> 00:56:54,459
Excellent party.

1140
00:56:58,131 --> 00:57:00,565
Have a lovely evening.
Enjoy.

1141
00:57:00,633 --> 00:57:02,266
Ah! Lord and Lady...

1142
00:57:02,335 --> 00:57:04,268
- Windermere.
- Windermere.

1143
00:57:05,755 --> 00:57:07,355
Where's Emily?

1144
00:57:07,424 --> 00:57:09,457
Perhaps she couldn't
fit into the dress.

1145
00:57:09,526 --> 00:57:13,461
Fitting in does seem to be
a problem for her.

1146
00:57:13,530 --> 00:57:17,181
Ah, lovely to see you again.
How are you keeping?

1147
00:57:17,250 --> 00:57:19,651
How are you?
Good to see you.

1148
00:57:33,149 --> 00:57:35,282
[woman gasps]
Stunning!

1149
00:57:45,679 --> 00:57:48,746
You look amazing.

1150
00:57:48,815 --> 00:57:49,814
Thank you.

1151
00:57:49,883 --> 00:57:51,382
Remember this look

1152
00:57:51,585 --> 00:57:54,368
because I might be
turning blue soon.

1153
00:57:54,437 --> 00:57:56,537
I couldn't let out the waist.

1154
00:57:56,606 --> 00:57:59,490
Well, after least let me
introduce you to some people

1155
00:57:59,560 --> 00:58:01,693
before you lose consciousness.

1156
00:58:15,458 --> 00:58:19,027
Ah, Princess Julia, I'd like you
to meet Emily Taylor.

1157
00:58:19,095 --> 00:58:20,428
Your Highness.

1158
00:58:20,497 --> 00:58:22,597
And this is
the Earl of Callenberg.

1159
00:58:22,666 --> 00:58:25,082
Fingers down.

1160
00:58:25,151 --> 00:58:26,734
It is a pleasure, my Lord.

1161
00:58:26,803 --> 00:58:27,752
Brilliant!

1162
00:58:28,905 --> 00:58:31,706
I do beg your pardon, sir.

1163
00:58:31,774 --> 00:58:33,391
Yes.

1164
00:58:35,595 --> 00:58:39,330
Can I present to you
the Grand Duke of Canterbury.

1165
00:58:39,399 --> 00:58:40,765
Emily Taylor.

1166
00:58:43,202 --> 00:58:45,870
It's a pleasure, Your Grace.

1167
00:58:45,938 --> 00:58:48,089
Indeed it is, my dear.

1168
00:58:48,158 --> 00:58:49,907
Well done.

1169
00:58:49,976 --> 00:58:51,943
- Shall we?
- Yes.

1170
00:58:52,012 --> 00:58:53,111
You okay?

1171
00:58:53,179 --> 00:58:55,513
Yes. It's beautiful here.

1172
00:58:57,250 --> 00:58:59,167
Glove.

1173
00:58:59,236 --> 00:59:02,137
Thank you.
Lovely canaps.

1174
00:59:02,205 --> 00:59:04,722
EMILY: Thank you.
LEO: Good evening.

1175
00:59:04,791 --> 00:59:06,157
Mmm.

1176
00:59:06,460 --> 00:59:07,758
Excellent.

1177
00:59:07,827 --> 00:59:09,560
Emily!

1178
00:59:09,629 --> 00:59:12,664
Poppy!
What are you doing here?

1179
00:59:12,732 --> 00:59:14,082
Aunt Galina invited me.

1180
00:59:14,150 --> 00:59:15,650
Oh, Baron, Baroness.

1181
00:59:15,719 --> 00:59:17,919
Oh, we're way beyond that.

1182
00:59:19,355 --> 00:59:21,205
It's so good to see you both.

1183
00:59:21,274 --> 00:59:22,941
You look positively beautiful.

1184
00:59:23,009 --> 00:59:24,709
Thank you. You as well.

1185
00:59:24,778 --> 00:59:27,344
Galina and I thought Poppy
might enjoy a night like this.

1186
00:59:27,413 --> 00:59:29,597
That is a wonderful idea.

1187
00:59:29,799 --> 00:59:32,133
Come on, let's find
the dessert table!

1188
00:59:32,202 --> 00:59:34,018
[laughter]

1189
00:59:34,087 --> 00:59:35,987
We're talking about...

1190
00:59:36,056 --> 00:59:38,405
adopting.

1191
00:59:41,028 --> 00:59:43,594
- Sweet.
- Yes!

1192
00:59:46,049 --> 00:59:48,066
Oh!

1193
00:59:48,135 --> 00:59:50,435
I barely recognized the dress.

1194
00:59:50,570 --> 00:59:53,638
I made a few adjustments.
I hope you don't mind.

1195
00:59:53,840 --> 00:59:57,192
Doesn't she look stunning,
Mother?

1196
00:59:57,260 --> 01:00:00,195
- Positively lovely.
- Thank you.

1197
01:00:00,263 --> 01:00:04,032
Leopold, we're opening the ball.

1198
01:00:10,924 --> 01:00:12,640
[applause]

1199
01:00:15,528 --> 01:00:16,844
I can't think
of a greater gift

1200
01:00:16,913 --> 01:00:19,380
than to have our own
Prince Leopold back

1201
01:00:19,449 --> 01:00:21,215
from his academic adventure.

1202
01:00:21,284 --> 01:00:23,684
And while I'm not
completely sure...

1203
01:00:23,753 --> 01:00:26,704
that they were
completely academic,

1204
01:00:26,773 --> 01:00:29,824
I can only assume that he has
retained enough knowledge

1205
01:00:29,892 --> 01:00:34,963
to resume his royal duties
and to tie a proper tie.

1206
01:00:35,032 --> 01:00:39,617
Thank you for that wonderful
vote of confidence, Mother.

1207
01:00:39,753 --> 01:00:41,553
So please enjoy
this evening's ball

1208
01:00:41,621 --> 01:00:45,573
and may all your holidays
be bright.

1209
01:00:54,500 --> 01:00:57,819
Emily Taylor,
would you like to dance?

1210
01:00:57,888 --> 01:01:01,255
Leo, it's the opening waltz.
That's us.

1211
01:01:01,324 --> 01:01:03,041
Oh, didn't Leo tell you?

1212
01:01:03,109 --> 01:01:06,393
We've always danced
the opening dance together.

1213
01:01:06,462 --> 01:01:08,663
No, I think he failed
to mention that.

1214
01:01:08,731 --> 01:01:10,481
Unfortunately,
we didn't get to last year

1215
01:01:10,550 --> 01:01:12,450
with him being
in America and all.

1216
01:01:12,518 --> 01:01:14,852
Even I took a year off
from being royal,

1217
01:01:14,921 --> 01:01:16,154
but we all come back.

1218
01:01:16,222 --> 01:01:18,406
It's who we are.

1219
01:01:18,475 --> 01:01:21,042
Come. Let's make up
for lost time.

1220
01:01:21,110 --> 01:01:25,713
I already told the grand duke
you'd do him the honor.

1221
01:01:25,782 --> 01:01:27,515
But the grand duke is 80.

1222
01:01:27,583 --> 01:01:29,234
He's still upright though.

1223
01:01:29,302 --> 01:01:31,903
It would be an honor.

1224
01:01:31,972 --> 01:01:33,805
Thank you.

1225
01:01:38,061 --> 01:01:40,094
Now where were we?

1226
01:01:40,163 --> 01:01:41,763
Oh, yes.

1227
01:01:41,831 --> 01:01:45,867
I know you don't waltz,
but we can wing it.

1228
01:01:46,069 --> 01:01:48,853
I would love to waltz,
Your Majesty.

1229
01:01:59,549 --> 01:02:01,048
Where did you learn
to dance like this?

1230
01:02:01,117 --> 01:02:02,983
Victor.

1231
01:02:03,052 --> 01:02:04,619
Ah, Victor.

1232
01:02:34,433 --> 01:02:36,850
-  Da 
- [laughs]

1233
01:02:36,919 --> 01:02:38,703
[applause]

1234
01:02:41,675 --> 01:02:43,924
Shall we go out
onto the balcony?

1235
01:02:43,993 --> 01:02:47,295
There's something
I'd like to ask you.

1236
01:02:47,364 --> 01:02:49,930
Switch partners?

1237
01:02:54,203 --> 01:02:56,270
Should we sit this one out?

1238
01:02:56,339 --> 01:02:58,472
A fine idea, my dear.
Thank you.

1239
01:03:17,527 --> 01:03:19,527
She's not that good.

1240
01:03:19,596 --> 01:03:22,814
You're a terrible liar,
but thank you.

1241
01:03:34,577 --> 01:03:37,895
Look at those two.
The perfect couple.

1242
01:03:37,964 --> 01:03:41,449
They were made
for one another.

1243
01:03:41,517 --> 01:03:43,901
And I drink to that.

1244
01:04:06,042 --> 01:04:08,108
Oh, hey.

1245
01:04:08,178 --> 01:04:12,213
Don't let me interrupt.
I just... I just need a break.

1246
01:04:12,282 --> 01:04:13,881
You've come to the right place.

1247
01:04:13,949 --> 01:04:16,450
Oh, Emily,
you look so beautiful.

1248
01:04:16,519 --> 01:04:18,352
You look positively royal.

1249
01:04:18,421 --> 01:04:19,920
Thank you.

1250
01:04:19,989 --> 01:04:22,657
Thank you for the gifts
under the tree, Emily.

1251
01:04:22,725 --> 01:04:24,124
- Thank you so much.
- Yeah.

1252
01:04:24,194 --> 01:04:25,526
- That's so kind.
- Of course.

1253
01:04:25,678 --> 01:04:26,710
They're just little things.

1254
01:04:26,779 --> 01:04:28,179
I just wanted you guys to know

1255
01:04:28,247 --> 01:04:30,514
how much I appreciate you
making me feel so welcome.

1256
01:04:30,583 --> 01:04:31,598
Bonbons?

1257
01:04:31,667 --> 01:04:33,100
I'm starving. Yes.

1258
01:04:33,169 --> 01:04:36,637
But you know what? Do you
have anything more filling?

1259
01:04:36,706 --> 01:04:38,473
What would you like to eat?

1260
01:04:38,541 --> 01:04:41,242
I would kill for
a six-foot hoagie right now.

1261
01:04:41,310 --> 01:04:44,178
- Hoagie?
- A what?

1262
01:04:44,247 --> 01:04:48,182
Oh! You've never lived
until you've tried one.

1263
01:04:59,362 --> 01:05:01,212
Oh, I never tire
of watching the two of you.

1264
01:05:01,281 --> 01:05:04,415
And we never tire
of being watched, do we, Leo?

1265
01:05:04,484 --> 01:05:05,616
Where's Emily?

1266
01:05:05,684 --> 01:05:07,751
Oh, she somewhere.

1267
01:05:08,021 --> 01:05:10,521
Leopold, you must say hello
to the Count of Glendower

1268
01:05:10,589 --> 01:05:12,356
and the Duchess of Wingate.

1269
01:05:12,424 --> 01:05:14,692
You have so much
catching up to do.

1270
01:05:18,832 --> 01:05:20,898
You have outdone yourself,
Isadora.

1271
01:05:20,967 --> 01:05:23,000
Everything is splendid.

1272
01:05:23,069 --> 01:05:24,202
Not everything.

1273
01:05:24,270 --> 01:05:26,921
I'm not one to give up.
You know that.

1274
01:05:26,990 --> 01:05:28,856
But maybe Leo and I
aren't meant to be.

1275
01:05:28,925 --> 01:05:31,709
Natasha, this has been planned
since you were children.

1276
01:05:31,778 --> 01:05:34,678
But you've seen the way
he looks at her.

1277
01:05:34,747 --> 01:05:38,249
I've seen him look at you
the same way too.

1278
01:05:38,318 --> 01:05:39,917
Not in a long time.

1279
01:05:40,053 --> 01:05:43,287
Perhaps we're not
going about this the right way.

1280
01:05:43,356 --> 01:05:45,356
Victor?

1281
01:05:45,424 --> 01:05:47,091
Where is she?

1282
01:05:48,428 --> 01:05:52,430
So this, my friends,
is a Philadelphia Hoagie.

1283
01:05:52,499 --> 01:05:54,965
We have cheese, chicken,
salami, pickles.

1284
01:05:55,034 --> 01:05:56,701
You can never have
too many pickles.

1285
01:05:56,770 --> 01:05:59,537
Oh, you know what we need?
Baloney.

1286
01:05:59,606 --> 01:06:01,539
Oh, we have mutton.

1287
01:06:01,608 --> 01:06:03,307
Okay, that'll do.

1288
01:06:03,376 --> 01:06:05,142
Wait. What is mutton again?

1289
01:06:05,211 --> 01:06:06,911
- Here's some jellied eels.
- No, no, no.

1290
01:06:06,979 --> 01:06:08,513
We're gonna draw the line
at that.

1291
01:06:08,581 --> 01:06:09,980
Not putting that on there.

1292
01:06:10,049 --> 01:06:12,550
- [laughter]
- What is this?

1293
01:06:12,618 --> 01:06:15,536
Your Majesty,
we didn't expect you.

1294
01:06:15,605 --> 01:06:17,804
So it appears.

1295
01:06:20,260 --> 01:06:23,527
I was just making them
a little American cuisine.

1296
01:06:23,596 --> 01:06:24,896
And what might that be?

1297
01:06:24,964 --> 01:06:27,898
McDonald's?
Kentucky Fried Chicken?

1298
01:06:27,967 --> 01:06:30,518
It appears that
it is more important

1299
01:06:30,586 --> 01:06:32,987
for you to take care
of your stomachs

1300
01:06:33,055 --> 01:06:36,540
than attend to your jobs
and take care of our guests.

1301
01:06:36,809 --> 01:06:39,193
You two, you are fired.

1302
01:06:39,262 --> 01:06:41,412
It's Christmas Eve,
Your Majesty.

1303
01:06:41,481 --> 01:06:43,915
Please don't punish them.
This is completely my fault.

1304
01:06:43,983 --> 01:06:46,250
They know their places.

1305
01:06:46,319 --> 01:06:48,502
Perhaps the problem here
is you don't know yours.

1306
01:06:48,571 --> 01:06:52,273
You're still under the illusion
that you belong with Leopold.

1307
01:06:52,342 --> 01:06:57,345
But he belongs with a royal,
not a commoner.

1308
01:06:57,413 --> 01:07:01,698
The throne is more than just
a bench covered with velvet.

1309
01:07:01,767 --> 01:07:03,968
It is so much more.

1310
01:07:04,037 --> 01:07:07,989
You have no idea
of what it takes to be a royal.

1311
01:07:14,897 --> 01:07:16,630
I'm so sorry.

1312
01:07:16,699 --> 01:07:19,132
I'm-- I'm so sorry.

1313
01:07:19,201 --> 01:07:20,067
You didn't know.

1314
01:07:20,135 --> 01:07:23,621
No, but I should have. I...

1315
01:07:23,689 --> 01:07:25,689
Don't worry, miss.

1316
01:07:25,758 --> 01:07:27,574
Miss?

1317
01:07:27,643 --> 01:07:31,295
You are a guest of the prince,
and I'm the maid.

1318
01:07:35,635 --> 01:07:37,768
I'm so sorry.

1319
01:07:43,743 --> 01:07:46,911
I would do anything
to fix this, Victor.

1320
01:07:46,980 --> 01:07:50,114
I don't think
I could feel much worse.

1321
01:07:50,182 --> 01:07:53,534
To Prince Leopold's
return home! Cheers!

1322
01:07:53,602 --> 01:07:55,469
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

1323
01:07:55,538 --> 01:07:58,139
- [glasses clink]
- So nice to have you back.

1324
01:07:58,208 --> 01:08:01,042
Pleasure. Thanks for coming.
Nice to see you all.

1325
01:08:01,110 --> 01:08:03,877
Apparently I can feel worse.

1326
01:08:10,803 --> 01:08:14,905
I believe Miss Taylor will be
heading home for the holidays.

1327
01:08:15,208 --> 01:08:18,158
Is this really what you want?

1328
01:08:18,227 --> 01:08:22,630
What I want doesn't matter.
It's the way things are.

1329
01:08:22,698 --> 01:08:24,531
You of all people know that.

1330
01:08:24,600 --> 01:08:29,169
And you of all people
can change the way things are.

1331
01:08:29,238 --> 01:08:31,672
I would've thought you've
seen enough broken hearts

1332
01:08:31,741 --> 01:08:33,474
in this castle.

1333
01:08:45,738 --> 01:08:47,938
- [knocking]
- Emily?

1334
01:08:48,007 --> 01:08:50,507
I've been looking all over
for you.

1335
01:08:50,576 --> 01:08:51,942
What's wrong?

1336
01:08:52,011 --> 01:08:55,613
I think I've had my fill
of the royal treatment.

1337
01:08:55,681 --> 01:08:57,181
Is this about Natasha?

1338
01:08:57,249 --> 01:08:59,200
You know she means
nothing to me.

1339
01:08:59,269 --> 01:09:03,087
Except for the fact that
she's perfect for you, Leo.

1340
01:09:03,156 --> 01:09:06,557
No, she's not.
She's perfect for my mother.

1341
01:09:06,626 --> 01:09:08,609
I got the staff fired.

1342
01:09:08,611 --> 01:09:10,444
- What?
- I got them fired.

1343
01:09:10,513 --> 01:09:13,614
Look, she would fire
the whole of Parliament

1344
01:09:13,682 --> 01:09:15,232
if it meant you would leave.

1345
01:09:15,301 --> 01:09:19,654
I'll fix everything.
I promise.

1346
01:09:20,690 --> 01:09:21,889
Come here.

1347
01:09:25,160 --> 01:09:30,764
There something I've wanted
to ask you all night.

1348
01:09:30,833 --> 01:09:35,503
In fact,
pretty much since we met.

1349
01:09:35,571 --> 01:09:40,875
Now, this isn't exactly
how I planned it, but...

1350
01:09:44,863 --> 01:09:49,800
This ring has been in our family
for centuries.

1351
01:09:49,869 --> 01:09:53,704
And now it belongs on you.

1352
01:09:53,773 --> 01:09:56,357
Marry me.

1353
01:09:59,545 --> 01:10:04,899
I would love nothing more if
it were just... Leo and Emily,

1354
01:10:04,967 --> 01:10:08,319
but it isn't just us anymore.

1355
01:10:08,387 --> 01:10:11,572
Leo, your mom was right.
I don't belong here.

1356
01:10:11,641 --> 01:10:14,525
Not upstairs or downstairs.

1357
01:10:14,593 --> 01:10:18,496
I'm not a princess,
and I'm never gonna be.

1358
01:10:18,564 --> 01:10:20,698
LEO: That's not true.

1359
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:22,616
Yes, and we were
so happy at home.

1360
01:10:22,685 --> 01:10:27,087
But here I just feel like I have
to be someone that I'm not.

1361
01:10:27,156 --> 01:10:30,390
And the truth is
I don't want to be anyone else.

1362
01:10:30,560 --> 01:10:34,928
I'm not ashamed of my people.
I'm proud of them.

1363
01:10:34,997 --> 01:10:36,881
And I can't lose who I am

1364
01:10:36,949 --> 01:10:39,683
to fit into a place
that I don't belong.

1365
01:10:39,752 --> 01:10:44,504
You belong with me, okay?
Wherever that is.

1366
01:10:44,573 --> 01:10:47,173
We can go back to Philly.
I'll renounce my title.

1367
01:10:47,493 --> 01:10:49,226
- You can't.
- If I have to choose

1368
01:10:49,295 --> 01:10:51,745
between being Prince Leopold
and being with you,

1369
01:10:51,814 --> 01:10:55,049
I chose you.
Every time.

1370
01:10:55,284 --> 01:10:59,503
I can't let you do that.
I can't let you give up

1371
01:10:59,538 --> 01:11:03,708
everything that your family
has built for you.

1372
01:11:08,447 --> 01:11:13,166
Your future is here.
It's not with me.

1373
01:11:28,017 --> 01:11:30,000
Nice knowing you guys.

1374
01:11:34,791 --> 01:11:37,324
I speak for the entire staff

1375
01:11:37,392 --> 01:11:39,326
and for those who are
no longer part of the staff

1376
01:11:39,394 --> 01:11:42,529
when I say that it has been
a true pleasure to serve you.

1377
01:11:45,868 --> 01:11:49,586
Thank you, Victor,
for everything.

1378
01:11:52,392 --> 01:11:54,958
I'm so sorry again
for what happened.

1379
01:11:55,027 --> 01:11:57,695
OLIVIA: It's okay.

1380
01:11:57,763 --> 01:11:59,497
WILL: Don't worry, Emily.

1381
01:12:17,082 --> 01:12:19,216
You don't have
to do this, Emily.

1382
01:12:21,888 --> 01:12:26,774
This will always-- always be
the best year of my life.

1383
01:12:26,842 --> 01:12:28,809
I love you.

1384
01:12:31,613 --> 01:12:33,213
And I love you.

1385
01:12:33,282 --> 01:12:36,099
Surely that's enough.

1386
01:12:36,168 --> 01:12:40,554
In my world maybe, but...

1387
01:12:40,623 --> 01:12:42,590
not in yours.

1388
01:13:19,828 --> 01:13:21,795
Leopold...

1389
01:13:21,864 --> 01:13:24,632
Well done, Mother.

1390
01:13:24,700 --> 01:13:26,500
She's gone.

1391
01:13:28,837 --> 01:13:30,003
Merry Christmas.

1392
01:13:30,072 --> 01:13:34,441
[bell tolling]

1393
01:13:44,236 --> 01:13:48,421
Another successful ball.
You must be pleased.

1394
01:13:51,677 --> 01:13:53,610
Do I look pleased?

1395
01:13:53,679 --> 01:13:55,445
I was being polite.

1396
01:13:58,034 --> 01:14:00,634
That girl has affected
everyone here.

1397
01:14:00,702 --> 01:14:02,536
And then some.

1398
01:14:03,573 --> 01:14:08,075
And yet she's managed
to stay true to herself,

1399
01:14:08,143 --> 01:14:11,045
which is more
than I can say about me.

1400
01:14:11,113 --> 01:14:15,632
I'd like to disagree,
but I can't.

1401
01:14:17,536 --> 01:14:19,937
You've known me a long time,
Victor.

1402
01:14:21,073 --> 01:14:23,240
Some may say too long.

1403
01:14:25,294 --> 01:14:27,461
I fear I've made
a terrible mistake.

1404
01:14:27,530 --> 01:14:29,430
I don't believe
I've ever heard you say that.

1405
01:14:29,498 --> 01:14:32,366
And you never will again.

1406
01:14:35,487 --> 01:14:38,188
I hope it's not too late.

1407
01:14:38,257 --> 01:14:42,125
It's never too late
when love is involved.

1408
01:15:00,779 --> 01:15:03,480
Leo, you look
positively miserable.

1409
01:15:03,549 --> 01:15:04,915
Come, let's go for a ride
together.

1410
01:15:04,984 --> 01:15:09,119
- That always cheers you up.
- No, thanks.

1411
01:15:09,188 --> 01:15:11,655
That's not like you.

1412
01:15:11,723 --> 01:15:13,123
And what am I like?

1413
01:15:13,192 --> 01:15:15,726
You're... I don't know.

1414
01:15:15,795 --> 01:15:17,428
Who you've always been.

1415
01:15:17,496 --> 01:15:21,081
I'm a prince,
and you're a duchess.

1416
01:15:21,150 --> 01:15:23,584
But those are just titles.

1417
01:15:23,653 --> 01:15:26,519
It's not who we are.

1418
01:15:26,588 --> 01:15:29,506
I want to be more
than a title to someone.

1419
01:15:30,793 --> 01:15:31,858
And you should too.

1420
01:15:34,346 --> 01:15:38,248
Time heals all wounds.

1421
01:15:38,317 --> 01:15:41,418
I don't suppose
there's a chance for us,

1422
01:15:41,487 --> 01:15:43,821
after a suitable
grace period?

1423
01:15:43,889 --> 01:15:46,089
Seriously?

1424
01:15:46,158 --> 01:15:48,959
I thought not.

1425
01:15:49,027 --> 01:15:51,211
You know, I did get
a New Year's invite

1426
01:15:51,280 --> 01:15:52,913
from the Count of York,

1427
01:15:52,981 --> 01:15:55,582
who I hear has
quite a good-looking son.

1428
01:15:55,651 --> 01:15:57,184
He does.

1429
01:15:57,253 --> 01:15:59,219
Unfortunately he's nine.

1430
01:15:59,288 --> 01:16:01,922
That is unfortunate.

1431
01:16:04,643 --> 01:16:08,796
I have to say that,
despite my behavior,

1432
01:16:08,864 --> 01:16:12,766
I was quite impressed
with Emily.

1433
01:16:12,835 --> 01:16:17,271
Yes, well, if I ever
see her again,

1434
01:16:17,339 --> 01:16:20,840
I'll be sure
to mention it.

1435
01:16:20,909 --> 01:16:23,961
I am sorry.

1436
01:16:24,029 --> 01:16:27,397
Your Royal Highness, the queen
wishes a word with you.

1437
01:16:27,466 --> 01:16:29,199
And what word would that be,
Victor?

1438
01:16:29,267 --> 01:16:31,001
That's not for me to say.

1439
01:16:31,069 --> 01:16:34,104
But it would be nice
if "sorry" was amongst them.

1440
01:16:55,645 --> 01:16:58,779
I assumed you'd have
thrown that away by now.

1441
01:17:01,817 --> 01:17:05,719
Did you know that Ben Franklin
invented the lightning rod?

1442
01:17:05,788 --> 01:17:07,871
And the swim fins, I'm told.

1443
01:17:09,842 --> 01:17:11,608
Do have a seat, Leopold.

1444
01:17:12,844 --> 01:17:14,477
Please.

1445
01:17:20,702 --> 01:17:26,523
Before I met your father,
I fell in love with a commoner.

1446
01:17:29,261 --> 01:17:31,444
He couldn't have been
more unsuitable.

1447
01:17:31,514 --> 01:17:33,514
But I didn't care.

1448
01:17:33,582 --> 01:17:36,316
We understood each other.

1449
01:17:36,385 --> 01:17:39,319
And he called me Izzy.

1450
01:17:40,622 --> 01:17:44,474
To my parents' horror,
we wanted to marry.

1451
01:17:44,543 --> 01:17:47,961
Sometimes I wish we had,

1452
01:17:48,029 --> 01:17:51,297
but then I wouldn't
have you, and...

1453
01:17:51,367 --> 01:17:54,568
you are my greatest
accomplishment.

1454
01:17:54,637 --> 01:17:56,737
Your father was a good man,

1455
01:17:56,805 --> 01:17:58,738
and we were happy
in our own way,

1456
01:17:58,807 --> 01:18:02,409
but... we never
laughed together,

1457
01:18:02,478 --> 01:18:05,962
we never had what you and Emily
have together.

1458
01:18:06,031 --> 01:18:11,017
And what happened to him,
the commoner?

1459
01:18:13,172 --> 01:18:17,040
He did what he was
supposed to do, as did I.

1460
01:18:17,109 --> 01:18:20,660
He went into service,
and I became the queen.

1461
01:18:23,099 --> 01:18:27,550
Leo, I want so much for you.

1462
01:18:27,619 --> 01:18:31,955
But more than anything,
I want you to be happy.

1463
01:18:34,744 --> 01:18:36,994
What are these two doing here?

1464
01:18:37,062 --> 01:18:38,795
I rehired them.

1465
01:18:38,864 --> 01:18:41,515
In fact, I gave them each
a promotion.

1466
01:18:43,535 --> 01:18:45,502
Your toast and marmalade,
Your Majesty.

1467
01:18:45,570 --> 01:18:46,886
Quince?

1468
01:18:46,955 --> 01:18:48,922
Yes, ma'am.

1469
01:18:48,991 --> 01:18:51,657
Your tea, Your Majesty.

1470
01:18:53,412 --> 01:18:54,610
Well done.

1471
01:18:54,847 --> 01:18:58,214
Well, I think an oil painting
is in order.

1472
01:18:58,283 --> 01:19:00,466
You approve then.

1473
01:19:00,535 --> 01:19:01,785
Well, the day is young.

1474
01:19:01,854 --> 01:19:04,204
Not as young as we'd
both like though.

1475
01:19:04,272 --> 01:19:06,740
So true.

1476
01:19:10,312 --> 01:19:12,829
Victor...

1477
01:19:12,898 --> 01:19:16,199
I'd like you to make
a royal announcement.

1478
01:19:16,268 --> 01:19:18,485
Prince Leopold is in love.

1479
01:19:18,787 --> 01:19:23,757
Not with a duchess,
but with a clothes designer.

1480
01:19:26,395 --> 01:19:28,694
And I give them my blessing.

1481
01:19:31,316 --> 01:19:33,116
I love you, Mum.

1482
01:19:36,504 --> 01:19:38,638
And I love you too, Leo.

1483
01:19:42,294 --> 01:19:44,627
Victor, fuel up the jet.

1484
01:19:44,897 --> 01:19:46,480
I've already taken the liberty.

1485
01:19:46,548 --> 01:19:47,697
I'll pack a bag.

1486
01:19:47,766 --> 01:19:50,517
As it happens,
you're already packed.

1487
01:19:57,676 --> 01:20:01,060
It's been a long time
since he called me mum.

1488
01:20:01,129 --> 01:20:04,948
And there you were
afraid of losing him.

1489
01:20:05,084 --> 01:20:07,650
I can't remember
a better holiday.

1490
01:20:09,404 --> 01:20:10,937
I remember one.

1491
01:20:11,006 --> 01:20:13,656
A long time ago.

1492
01:20:15,760 --> 01:20:17,594
So do I.

1493
01:20:17,663 --> 01:20:20,180
Will there be anything else,
Your Majesty?

1494
01:20:24,252 --> 01:20:26,436
Just one more thing, Victor.

1495
01:20:26,504 --> 01:20:28,855
Call me Izzy.

1496
01:20:54,416 --> 01:20:55,749
Dad, don't.

1497
01:20:55,818 --> 01:20:57,968
Leave it up.

1498
01:20:58,036 --> 01:21:00,420
Sorry, kid. I could've sworn
he was the one.

1499
01:21:00,489 --> 01:21:03,056
- Me too.
- Me too.

1500
01:21:03,124 --> 01:21:04,424
Look at the bright side.

1501
01:21:04,493 --> 01:21:07,460
You'll have more time
for your clothing designs again.

1502
01:21:07,529 --> 01:21:09,729
And the world awaits.

1503
01:21:12,401 --> 01:21:14,000
Emily...

1504
01:21:14,069 --> 01:21:15,168
Hmm?

1505
01:21:25,247 --> 01:21:27,047
Leo.

1506
01:21:27,116 --> 01:21:29,665
Leo...

1507
01:21:29,734 --> 01:21:32,636
what are you doing here?

1508
01:21:32,705 --> 01:21:36,790
I asked you in the castle,
and you said no,

1509
01:21:36,859 --> 01:21:39,676
so I thought
I'd give it a shot here,

1510
01:21:39,744 --> 01:21:41,812
in the place we first met.

1511
01:21:41,880 --> 01:21:45,832
We do come from
different worlds,

1512
01:21:45,901 --> 01:21:49,652
but that doesn't matter
because we found each other.

1513
01:21:49,721 --> 01:21:51,855
And the only titles
I care about

1514
01:21:51,923 --> 01:21:56,360
are you and I
as husband and wife.

1515
01:21:56,428 --> 01:21:58,595
So I'm asking you again,

1516
01:21:58,864 --> 01:22:02,432
this time
as Leo from Philly...

1517
01:22:02,501 --> 01:22:06,602
and Leopold from Cordinia.

1518
01:22:08,690 --> 01:22:11,591
Emily Taylor...

1519
01:22:11,660 --> 01:22:15,028
will you marry me?

1520
01:22:17,632 --> 01:22:21,534
You have no idea
how much I want to say yes.

1521
01:22:21,603 --> 01:22:23,469
But, Leo, your mother
would never--

1522
01:22:23,538 --> 01:22:24,988
Say yes, Emily.

1523
01:22:30,579 --> 01:22:33,329
Your Majesty.

1524
01:22:33,398 --> 01:22:35,048
I am so sorry, Emily.

1525
01:22:35,117 --> 01:22:36,716
I just hope
you can forgive me.

1526
01:22:36,986 --> 01:22:38,634
I was so wrong about you.

1527
01:22:38,703 --> 01:22:40,353
I've been wrong
about a few things.

1528
01:22:40,421 --> 01:22:42,722
Just a few?

1529
01:22:43,075 --> 01:22:46,259
I have a dress
that needs alteration.

1530
01:22:48,113 --> 01:22:52,015
I've saved it for the woman
that would marry my son, and...

1531
01:22:52,084 --> 01:22:56,253
I truly hope
that it will be you.

1532
01:23:01,726 --> 01:23:03,477
As your Ben Franklin
would say,

1533
01:23:03,595 --> 01:23:07,364
"I think you could bring some
much needed electricity

1534
01:23:07,366 --> 01:23:09,366
into the realm."

1535
01:23:13,071 --> 01:23:17,323
So you need me to ask you
a third time?

1536
01:23:17,493 --> 01:23:20,894
Do you mind? I forgot to press
the record button the last time.

1537
01:23:20,963 --> 01:23:23,479
Dad...
[laughs]

1538
01:23:23,548 --> 01:23:25,848
I would like to hear it,
Leopold.

1539
01:23:28,470 --> 01:23:29,820
All right.

1540
01:23:29,888 --> 01:23:32,221
Emily Taylor, will you--

1541
01:23:32,290 --> 01:23:34,474
Yes! Yes!

1542
01:23:34,542 --> 01:23:38,044
[laughter]

1543
01:23:40,999 --> 01:23:42,115
Wow.

1544
01:23:47,890 --> 01:23:50,607
So come on, everybody,
let's celebrate!

1545
01:23:50,676 --> 01:23:52,826
Celebrate! Whoo!

1546
01:24:07,475 --> 01:24:12,362
<i>[organ playing
"O Come All Ye Faithful"]</i>

1547
01:24:48,734 --> 01:24:51,334
You'll always be my princess.

1548
01:25:20,698 --> 01:25:23,199
This is like a fairy tale.

1549
01:25:24,502 --> 01:25:26,603
It's better.

1550
01:25:26,671 --> 01:25:29,305
It's real.

1551
01:25:56,083 --> 01:25:59,185
LEO: It's a Cordinian
Christmas miracle.
