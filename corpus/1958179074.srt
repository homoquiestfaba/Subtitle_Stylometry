- Flight 13 from Los Angeles
to Lasaria

688
00:55:18,418 --> 00:55:19,454
is now landing.

689
00:55:20,040 --> 00:55:21,283
- Where is he?

690
00:55:21,352 --> 00:55:23,872
He must have found him by now.
It's been hours.

691
00:55:24,838 --> 00:55:26,771
Mr. Frankenstein
is due here this evening

692
00:55:26,840 --> 00:55:29,118
and the boy
and the monster must be found.

693
00:55:30,327 --> 00:55:33,088
- Billy.

694
00:55:33,157 --> 00:55:37,851
Monster. Billy.

695
00:55:40,302 --> 00:55:43,892
Billy?
Monster?

696
00:55:49,449 --> 00:55:52,314
- Whoa, okay.

697
00:55:52,383 --> 00:55:53,695
This is where we have to split

698
00:55:53,764 --> 00:55:56,249
because my mom will not fly
for that disguise.

699
00:55:56,318 --> 00:55:57,802
Now, me and Bloodstone,

700
00:55:57,871 --> 00:55:59,528
we'll come find you
as soon as we can,

701
00:55:59,597 --> 00:56:03,187
but for now don't go anywhere.

702
00:56:13,818 --> 00:56:15,717
Hi, Mom.

703
00:56:15,786 --> 00:56:18,754
- Billy, don't ever scare me
like that again,

704
00:56:18,823 --> 00:56:20,756
ever, ever, ever.

705
00:56:20,825 --> 00:56:22,620
- Okay. Okay. Geez.

706
00:56:22,689 --> 00:56:27,763
- Sorry. Well, just
so you know. Honey.

707
00:56:28,419 --> 00:56:30,110
- Aw, Mom.

708
00:56:30,663 --> 00:56:32,768
- Sorry. Sorry.

709
00:56:32,837 --> 00:56:34,460
- Oh, so where's
Mr. Bloodstone's present?

710
00:56:34,529 --> 00:56:36,634
We were all dying to see.

711
00:56:36,703 --> 00:56:39,396
- Madam, perhaps I should take
Master William up to his room.

712
00:56:39,465 --> 00:56:41,328
It's been rather
an eventful day,

713
00:56:41,398 --> 00:56:43,779
what with his father
arriving any minute.

714
00:56:43,848 --> 00:56:45,574
- Dad? Dad's coming?

715
00:56:45,643 --> 00:56:47,542
Mom, is that true?
How come you didn't tell me?

716
00:56:47,611 --> 00:56:49,336
- Shush, shush. Yes. Yes.
Yes.

717
00:56:49,406 --> 00:56:50,821
I didn't get a chance
to tell you.

718
00:56:50,890 --> 00:56:52,063
He should be here any moment.

719
00:56:52,132 --> 00:56:54,272
His boss gave him
some time off from work, so.

720
00:56:54,341 --> 00:56:56,240
- Oh, I can't believe this.

721
00:56:56,309 --> 00:56:58,242
Wow. Dad's really coming.
This is so cool.

722
00:56:58,311 --> 00:57:00,451
I have so many things
to talk to him about.

723
00:57:01,003 --> 00:57:02,557
You just wouldn't believe it.

724
00:57:02,626 --> 00:57:05,939
I better go upstairs and get
changed before he gets here.

725
00:57:06,008 --> 00:57:07,700
This is so cool.

726
00:57:10,150 --> 00:57:11,807
- I'll just check and see

727
00:57:11,876 --> 00:57:13,878
if Master William
needs any assistance.

728
00:57:15,362 --> 00:57:17,399
- Look, I just know something
fishy's going on here.

729
00:57:17,468 --> 00:57:18,676
He didn't get him a present.

730
00:57:18,745 --> 00:57:21,921
- Thelma, let it go, honey.
Just let it go.

731
00:57:34,554 --> 00:57:36,176
- Huh?

732
00:57:40,802 --> 00:57:43,805
Where did he go now?

733
00:57:53,918 --> 00:57:56,818
- Wow.
Now this is what I call living.

734
00:57:59,959 --> 00:58:01,926
- This way, sir.

735
00:58:01,995 --> 00:58:03,652
- Wonder where they dug him up.

736
00:58:37,928 --> 00:58:39,861
- Master William,
where is the monster?

737
00:58:42,001 --> 00:58:43,796
- Oh, no.
I left him out front.

738
00:58:55,324 --> 00:58:58,500
Just follow me and don't let
anyone go outside.

745
00:59:33,984 --> 00:59:37,228
it's good to have you home once
again after all these years.

746
00:59:37,781 --> 00:59:39,161
- It's good to be home.

Hey, where's Billy?
I'm dying to see him.

748
00:59:41,336 --> 00:59:42,475
- He'll be down shortly.

00:59:42,544 --> 00:59:44,719
I believe he has
a little surprise for you.

00:59:45,685 --> 00:59:48,757
Come, sir. Let us get something
warm to drink in the kitchen.

about you like that,

Uh-oh. What's the matter?

Oh, we've got to get you
powered up again, huh?

757

Hey, do you mind helping me
with my grandma here.

758
01:00:41,327 --> 01:00:44,571
She's had a little bit of...
too much to drink, yeah.

- You've got one
big grandma, kid.

761
01:00:50,716 --> 01:00:52,821
- Yeah. I know.
That's what I love about her.

762
01:00:54,996 --> 01:00:56,722
Yeah. Come on.

763
01:00:56,791 --> 01:01:03,211
Come on, Grandma.
Let's go inside. Come on.

764

- So, how's the hot cocoa?
- Hits the spot.

Now, about seeing my son?

- Mr. Bloodstone, could you
come out here for a second?

on my surprise.

Oh, no. She's not heavy.

- She's the kid's grandmother.
Good night.

772
01:01:36,796 --> 01:01:38,246
- Oh!
- He needs more power.

773
01:01:38,315 --> 01:01:40,420
You can fix him, can't you?
- I don't know. Hurry.

774
01:01:40,489 --> 01:01:42,388
We must move quickly
to the laboratory.

- Hurry.
- You can fix him, can't you?

Oh, please, please be okay.

to leave him alone.

Honest, I didn't.

- What do I do?
I don't have anything.

- Here. Give this to him.

787
01:02:31,644 --> 01:02:34,233
It should rekindle
some of his lost memories.

788
01:02:35,648 --> 01:02:38,651
It was one of
Dr. Frankenstein's

789

most prized possessions.

- Wow.
Is this who I think it is?

Now go. Go.

Easy. Rest now. Yes.

to let you get away so quickly.

to tell you, too.

Oh, how are you, buddy?
Sit down here.

01:03:31,014 --> 01:03:33,982
- Don't go back to that
awful hotel ever, ever again.

805
01:03:34,051 --> 01:03:35,466
- Son, somehow I don't think

806
01:03:35,535 --> 01:03:37,814
that's something you're going
to have to worry about.

807
01:03:37,883 --> 01:03:41,576
- Sandy, don't you have
something to tell George?

808
01:03:42,335 --> 01:03:44,579
- Thelma, dear, I don't mean
to be rude, but...

809
01:03:45,787 --> 01:03:47,720
No, I take that back.
I do mean to be rude.

810
01:03:47,789 --> 01:03:49,998
Could you leave this family
alone for just a few minutes

811
01:03:50,067 --> 01:03:51,758
and butt out?

812
01:03:54,037 --> 01:03:55,107
- Mm-hmm.
- Ha!

813
01:03:55,176 --> 01:03:56,798
- Boy, did she
have that coming.

814
01:03:56,867 --> 01:03:59,076
- Dad, that was so cool!
- You're welcome.

815
01:03:59,145 --> 01:04:02,390
- Oh, I almost forgot.
Here's your surprise.

816
01:04:04,461 --> 01:04:08,223
- Wait a minute.

817
01:04:08,292 --> 01:04:09,293
Billy, thank you.

818
01:04:10,570 --> 01:04:12,572
It's the nicest surprise
I've ever gotten.

819
01:04:14,333 --> 01:04:16,645
Now, let me say
what I have to say.

820
01:04:19,856 --> 01:04:21,650
Recently, someone told me

821
01:04:21,719 --> 01:04:23,998
I needed to get
my priorities straight.

822
01:04:24,067 --> 01:04:26,138
Well, as you know,
my priorities lately

823
01:04:26,207 --> 01:04:29,279
have consisted of one thing:
Holiday Hotels.

824
01:04:30,038 --> 01:04:31,315
I thought money
was more important

825
01:04:31,384 --> 01:04:33,179
to my family than I was.

826
01:04:33,248 --> 01:04:35,768
I figured if you guys
had things, you'd be happy.

827
01:04:36,424 --> 01:04:38,978
I was wrong.
I just couldn't see the signs

828
01:04:39,047 --> 01:04:41,705
until I was forced to face

829
01:04:41,774 --> 01:04:44,225
my past, my Frankenstein past.

830
01:04:45,536 --> 01:04:47,607
I admit I was scared.

831
01:04:47,676 --> 01:04:49,782
I did not want to be
a Frankenstein,

832
01:04:49,851 --> 01:04:52,923
so I changed my name and tried
to erase my past, everything,

833
01:04:54,097 --> 01:04:56,996
and in the process,
I almost lost the two things

834
01:04:57,065 --> 01:04:59,930
that are more important to me
than life itself:

835
01:04:59,999 --> 01:05:01,449
the two of you.

836
01:05:01,518 --> 01:05:03,830
Well, today,
I am a Frankenstein,

837
01:05:03,900 --> 01:05:06,730
and I couldn't be prouder,
and as of 10 a.m.

838
01:05:06,799 --> 01:05:08,801
Eastern
Standard Time yesterday,

839
01:05:08,870 --> 01:05:11,769
I am no longer employed
by Holiday Hotels.

840
01:05:11,838 --> 01:05:13,185
I was fired!

841
01:05:13,254 --> 01:05:15,808
So what if we don't have
any money, huh? We have this!

842
01:05:15,877 --> 01:05:19,087
Castle Frankenstein,
our home forever and ever.

843
01:05:19,846 --> 01:05:22,125
So hasn't all of this
just turned out great?

844
01:05:23,678 --> 01:05:27,337
- George, there's something
we've been meaning to tell you.

845
01:05:27,406 --> 01:05:28,855
- Shoot.

846
01:05:28,925 --> 01:05:33,550
- Well, it's kind of funny
actually. It goes like this.

847
01:05:40,591 --> 01:05:44,423
- I just know there's
something fishy going on here

848
01:05:44,492 --> 01:05:50,015
in Castle Frankenstein.
I just know it. I just know it.

849
01:05:59,886 --> 01:06:02,717
- That's all I can do until
young master Billy returns.

850

Only a true
Frankenstein's touch

01:06:06,169 --> 01:06:07,860
can make you
breathe once again.

852
01:06:09,482 --> 01:06:11,174
Sweet dreams, my friend.

853
01:06:18,526 --> 01:06:19,768
- Ah, don't worry, Sandy.

854
01:06:19,837 --> 01:06:21,943
We have 30 days
to raise that money.

855
01:06:22,012 --> 01:06:24,428
I'm applying for a loan at
the Bank of Vaseria on Monday,

856
01:06:24,497 --> 01:06:26,499
and looking through

01:17:19,013 --> 01:17:20,636
I've got a shopping mall
to tear down.

1028
01:17:20,705 --> 01:17:22,258
- Have you thought about
how we convince this guy

1029
01:17:22,327 --> 01:17:23,915
not to build the mall?

1030
01:17:23,984 --> 01:17:25,710
- No.
I just know we need to do it.

1031
01:17:26,607 --> 01:17:27,712
It's a good thing
he has no clue

1032
01:17:27,781 --> 01:17:29,472
about our present
financial difficulties.

1033
01:17:29,541 --> 01:17:31,681
That would make things
a whole lot harder.

1034
01:17:31,750 --> 01:17:33,234
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.
- What?

1035
01:17:33,303 --> 01:17:35,685
- Look, would you
just go upstairs

1036
01:17:35,754 --> 01:17:37,825
and make sure
that Billy is dressed, okay?

1037
01:17:39,413 --> 01:17:42,381
Ugh. Those Frankenstein boys.
You got to love them.

1038
01:17:44,418 --> 01:17:46,109
Okay. Good.

1039
01:17:54,462 --> 01:17:55,981
- I just hope
young Master Billy

1040
01:17:56,050 --> 01:17:57,707
knows what he's doing.

1041
01:17:59,191 --> 01:18:02,678
- Well, Dad, it's like this.
There's this monster...

1042
01:18:04,024 --> 01:18:05,681
No, that sucks.

1043
01:18:08,304 --> 01:18:11,238
Dad, remember when I was
a little kid and I was scared

1044
01:18:11,307 --> 01:18:14,172
because I thought there were
monsters living under my bed?

1045
01:18:15,725 --> 01:18:18,901
Ugh! There's got to be
some better way to do this.

1046
01:18:19,764 --> 01:18:22,490
Maybe I should just
bring him down to the lab,

1047
01:18:22,559 --> 01:18:24,700
flip the sheet and say...

1048
01:18:24,769 --> 01:18:28,427
- Hey, can I come in?
- Sure, Dad. Come on in.

1049
01:18:29,463 --> 01:18:32,949
- Great. Now, you're sure
you don't mind if I join you?

1050
01:18:34,813 --> 01:18:36,194
- Dad, what's up?

1051
01:18:36,263 --> 01:18:39,059
- Oh, your mom wanted me
to check on your wardrobe.

1052
01:18:39,128 --> 01:18:42,476
I'd say you look just as good
as the old man almost.

1053
01:18:43,235 --> 01:18:45,306
- Dad, there's something
I have to talk about.

1054
01:18:45,375 --> 01:18:47,723
- Yeah, just hold that thought
for a minute, okay?

1055
01:18:49,069 --> 01:18:51,002
Look, it's not much,

1056
01:18:51,071 --> 01:18:53,073
but I wanted to get you
a little present.

1057
01:18:54,212 --> 01:18:56,179
I know I haven't been
the greatest dad

1058
01:18:56,248 --> 01:18:57,905
that a kid could ask for.

1059
01:18:58,872 --> 01:19:00,805
I promise from now on,
I will be.

1060
01:19:06,086 --> 01:19:07,432
Well, I don't know
what I was thinking.

1061
01:19:07,501 --> 01:19:09,710
You're probably way
too old for dolls anyway,

1062
01:19:09,779 --> 01:19:11,816
you know.
I'll just take it back.

1063
01:19:11,885 --> 01:19:15,612
- No! I mean, yeah, I probably
am a little too old for dolls,

1064
01:19:15,681 --> 01:19:18,443
but not this one.
Oh, thank you, Dad. Thank you!

1065
01:19:18,512 --> 01:19:20,307
- Oh, you're welcome, pal.
You're welcome.

1066
01:19:20,376 --> 01:19:22,067
You really like it, huh?

1067
01:19:22,965 --> 01:19:25,070
Everything okay, huh?
Talk to me, buddy.

1068
01:19:26,347 --> 01:19:29,178
- Well, Dad, remember
when I was a little kid,

1069
01:19:29,247 --> 01:19:30,696
and I was scared
because I thought monsters

1070
01:19:30,766 --> 01:19:32,940
lived under my bed?

1071
01:19:33,009 --> 01:19:34,770
Well, Dad, it goes like this.

1072
01:19:39,740 --> 01:19:41,638
- Thelma, would you mind
being something

1073
01:19:41,707 --> 01:19:44,365
more than just a bump on a log
and help me with these?

1074
01:19:47,265 --> 01:19:49,267
Thelma. Thelma!
- What? What?

1075
01:19:49,336 --> 01:19:50,475
- Snap out of it!

1076
01:19:50,544 --> 01:19:51,648
Bloodstone is off
god-knows-where.

1077
01:19:51,717 --> 01:19:53,202
George is upstairs
helping Billy get ready,

1078
01:19:53,271 --> 01:19:55,204
and our guests are due
to arrive any minute.

1079
01:19:55,273 --> 01:19:57,482
Now, get off your butt
and help me.

1080
01:19:57,551 --> 01:19:59,035
Move it!

1081
01:20:24,958 --> 01:20:26,200
- Herr von Sloane.

1082
01:20:26,269 --> 01:20:28,927
- [foreign]
Enchante.

1083
01:20:30,066 --> 01:20:31,723
- Oh.

1084
01:20:31,792 --> 01:20:35,865
Fraulein Butker.
Thelma. Thelma.

1085
01:20:35,934 --> 01:20:36,866
Thelma.

1086
01:20:36,935 --> 01:20:38,143
Thelma!

1087
01:20:42,630 --> 01:20:43,631
How nice to meet you.

1088
01:20:43,700 --> 01:20:45,116
Won't you please come in?

1089
01:20:47,566 --> 01:20:48,844
Please.

1090
01:20:58,129 --> 01:21:01,235
- Hurry, young
Master Frankenstein. Hurry.

1091
01:21:02,858 --> 01:21:06,689
- I am the monster,

1092
01:21:06,758 --> 01:21:10,175
the Frankenstein monster.

1093
01:21:13,558 --> 01:21:15,560
God, these monster shoes.

1094
01:21:15,629 --> 01:21:19,219
How can a monster get anywhere
when a monster can't even walk?

1095
01:21:21,117 --> 01:21:22,187
Oh!

1096
01:21:25,570 --> 01:21:32,335
- So--

1097
01:21:32,404 --> 01:21:34,993
I can't imagine what's taking
George and Billy so long.

1098
01:21:35,960 --> 01:21:38,065
You never know what those two
are going to get up to.

1099
01:21:38,134 --> 01:21:40,240
It's a big place.
Maybe they got lost.

1100
01:21:41,655 --> 01:21:43,588
Oh, cheese?

1101
01:21:45,797 --> 01:21:46,832
No?

1102
01:21:47,419 --> 01:21:50,284
- I love cheese.
It's made with milk, you know.

1103
01:22:07,784 --> 01:22:10,339
- A more handsome monster
I have never seen.

1104
01:22:10,408 --> 01:22:12,997
- Dad, we got to hurry.
I think he's dying.

1105
01:22:13,066 --> 01:22:14,446
I'm here, Monster.
Don't worry.

1106
01:22:14,515 --> 01:22:16,172
Me and my dad
won't let you die.

1107
01:22:17,001 --> 01:22:18,519
- I don't understand.

1108
01:22:18,588 --> 01:22:21,660
Everything is as the doctor
specified, right down

1109
01:22:21,729 --> 01:22:23,835
to a true Frankenstein
pulling the lever.

1110
01:22:24,836 --> 01:22:26,769
I don't know what else to do.

1111
01:22:26,838 --> 01:22:30,014
- Wait a minute here.
Wait a minute. Let me see that.

1112
01:22:30,083 --> 01:22:31,774
- Hurry, Dad. Hurry.

1113
01:22:33,086 --> 01:22:35,226
- Here. Right here
in the fine print.

1114
01:22:35,295 --> 01:22:37,331
- Fine print?

1115
01:22:37,400 --> 01:22:39,230
- I guess I didn't
read that part.

1116
01:22:39,299 --> 01:22:41,128
- Don't ever buy a car
without me, son.

1117
01:22:41,715 --> 01:22:42,819
Anyway, I think
I may have figured out

1118
01:22:42,888 --> 01:22:45,132
where you two went wrong.
Listen to this:

1119
01:22:45,201 --> 01:22:46,789
"In the event of my death,

1120
01:22:46,858 --> 01:22:49,205
"the monster can only be
fully revived

1121
01:22:49,274 --> 01:22:54,107
"when reactivated by all the
remaining living Frankensteins.

1122
01:22:54,176 --> 01:22:56,281
"This way I can die
with the knowledge

1123
01:22:56,350 --> 01:22:58,214
"that I did everything
in my power

1124
01:22:58,283 --> 01:23:02,115
"to keep the Frankenstein
family legacy alive.

1125
01:23:03,254 --> 01:23:05,635
Sincerely,
Victor Frankenstein III."

1126
01:23:06,671 --> 01:23:09,536
Billy, like all
the remaining Frankensteins.

1127
01:23:09,605 --> 01:23:11,193
That's you and me, Billy.

1128
01:23:11,262 --> 01:23:13,160
I am the missing piece
to this puzzle.

1129
01:23:13,712 --> 01:23:15,404
- Hurry.
Time is of the essence.

1130
01:23:18,717 --> 01:23:20,409
Hurry.

1131
01:23:26,139 --> 01:23:29,314
Almost ready. Closer.

1132
01:23:32,421 --> 01:23:36,873
Closer, and now.

1133
01:24:20,710 --> 01:24:23,644
- Monster alive!

1134
01:24:23,713 --> 01:24:26,233
Ready to kick
some serious butt.

1135
01:24:30,927 --> 01:24:32,929
all: Uh-oh.

1136
01:24:39,177 --> 01:24:43,078
- Great. Thelma, would you
join me in the kitchen please?

1137
01:24:44,009 --> 01:24:45,701
- But...
- No buts! Move it.

1138
01:24:47,875 --> 01:24:49,498
Herr von Sloane,
Fraulein Butker,

1139
01:24:49,567 --> 01:24:50,947
back in a flash.

1140
01:24:53,916 --> 01:24:55,952
- Where is that imbecile,
Frog?

1141
01:24:56,021 --> 01:24:57,195
- Frogg.
- What?

1142
01:24:57,264 --> 01:24:59,784
- Frogg!
- It's been over an hour.

1143
01:25:00,336 --> 01:25:02,373
How much longer do
I have to put up with these

1144
01:25:02,442 --> 01:25:04,306
ridiculous foreigners?
Look.

1145
01:25:04,892 --> 01:25:08,103
I just want the monster here so
we can get on with it already.

1146
01:25:08,724 --> 01:25:10,035
- The lights are
flickering up and down.

1147
01:25:10,105 --> 01:25:12,452
I have no idea where George
and Billy are, and...

1148
01:25:14,005 --> 01:25:17,146
Wow!
- Oh, no.

1149
01:25:20,943 --> 01:25:23,842
- You're late,
you imbecilic moron!

1150
01:25:25,568 --> 01:25:28,088
Do you realize
that I was about to offer

1151
01:25:28,157 --> 01:25:32,265
to pay their taxes off,
costing me another $25,000?

1152
01:25:35,785 --> 01:25:38,133
Do you really think
that you can fool them

1153
01:25:38,788 --> 01:25:40,583
in that pathetic
looking costume?

1154
01:25:41,584 --> 01:25:44,760
You look sillier
now than you did then.

1155
01:25:46,313 --> 01:25:51,525
Oh, and that head.
Ah! Ah-ha-ha.

1156
01:25:51,594 --> 01:25:57,738
Ooh, ooh, hurties.
Ooh. Okay. Okay.

1157
01:25:58,463 --> 01:26:03,399
I give you the head,
but look at those fake bolts.

1158
01:26:07,265 --> 01:26:10,441
Ooh.

1159
01:26:10,510 --> 01:26:12,408
You're not Frog, are you?

1160
01:26:12,477 --> 01:26:14,686
- Frogg.
- No!

1161
01:26:16,619 --> 01:26:19,519
- Could you hold that growl
for just a second?

1162
01:26:20,313 --> 01:26:23,868
And we'll be right back.

1163
01:26:30,046 --> 01:26:34,465
- I am the monster! Run away!

1164
01:26:34,534 --> 01:26:36,191
- Frogg, get back!
- I come to eat...

1165
01:26:36,984 --> 01:26:38,227
- Frog! Frog!

1166
01:26:38,296 --> 01:26:40,402
Are you still looking
for your monster?

1167
01:26:40,471 --> 01:26:41,817
- Ja!

1168
01:26:41,886 --> 01:26:44,337
- Here he comes now!
- What are you talking about?

1169
01:26:44,406 --> 01:26:47,788
- Ah!

1170
01:26:47,857 --> 01:26:50,205
Ohh! Ohh!

1171
01:26:57,695 --> 01:27:00,732
- Ah! Oh! Gosh.

1172
01:27:01,561 --> 01:27:03,148
- Well, I guess
that's the last

1173
01:27:03,218 --> 01:27:04,357
we'll see of them for a while.

1174
01:27:04,426 --> 01:27:06,151
- Yeah, I just wish there was
some way

1175
01:27:06,221 --> 01:27:07,981
we could raise
that back tax money.

1176
01:27:08,844 --> 01:27:11,398
- Hey, I got an idea.
- Yeah?

1177
01:27:11,467 --> 01:27:13,089
- What?
- Is he for real?

1178
01:27:13,158 --> 01:27:14,850
- Oh, yeah. Every inch.

1179
01:27:16,610 --> 01:27:19,993
- Castle Frankenstein visiting
hours are from 9 to 5 p.m.

1180
01:27:20,511 --> 01:27:23,341
There is free parking
on Tuesdays and Thursdays,

1181
01:27:23,410 --> 01:27:25,861
and happy hour
is from 4 to 7 p.m.

1182
01:27:27,759 --> 01:27:30,072
- Welcome to Castle
Frankenstein,

1183
01:27:30,141 --> 01:27:32,350
the evilest place on Earth.

1184
01:27:32,419 --> 01:27:34,663
And this is where it all began.

1185
01:27:35,526 --> 01:27:39,184
The monster is made up
of over seven different people.

1186
01:27:39,254 --> 01:27:40,462
all: Ooh.

1187
01:27:40,531 --> 01:27:43,637
- And held together
with over 500 stitches.

1188
01:27:43,706 --> 01:27:44,880
all: Ah.

1189
01:27:44,949 --> 01:27:47,848
- If dissected and laid out
from end to end,

1190
01:27:47,917 --> 01:27:51,093
the monster would be over
24 feet long.

1191
01:27:51,162 --> 01:27:55,856
- Cool. What's that?
- Oh, no, don't. Stop.

1192
01:28:10,457 --> 01:28:12,148
- Far out.

1193
01:28:18,672 --> 01:28:19,880
- All right, folks.

1194
01:28:19,949 --> 01:28:21,744
If you'll follow me
