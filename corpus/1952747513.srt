00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,700
<i>Giants who created this world,
and now it seems left in chains...</i>

2
00:00:27,876 --> 00:00:32,876
<i>causes are a source of life and
all activities.</i>

3
00:00:33,167 --> 00:00:36,167
<i>But the chains are weak skills
meek and thought.</i>

4
00:00:37,977 --> 00:00:42,987
<i>The proverb reads:
'The weak in courage are strong in cunning. "</i>

5
00:00:43,485 --> 00:00:46,985
<i>Which means - one of the creatures is the creator,
</i>

6
00:00:48,099 --> 00:00:50,699
<i>and the second part is the destroyer.</i>

7
00:00:51,770 --> 00:00:56,290
<i>It seems that the destroyer
The creator keeps in his chains.</i>

8
00:00:56,834 --> 00:01:02,204
<i>Not so, he is just a small part of
The existence of the whole thing.</i>

9
00:01:03,001 --> 00:01:06,301
<i>These two types of people
always over the earth,</i>

10
00:01:06,333 --> 00:01:08,333
<i>and must not be enemies.</i>

11
00:01:08,550 --> 00:01:11,550
<i>Whoever wants to reconcile them...</i>

12
00:01:11,855 --> 00:01:15,745
... seeks to destroy existence.
- I do not want more of this play.

13
00:01:15,830 --> 00:01:17,830
Silence!

14
00:01:19,037 --> 00:01:21,277
Prepare for battle.

15
00:01:21,994 --> 00:01:25,264
- I gotta pee!
- Defends the stain of a rant!

16
00:01:25,653 --> 00:01:27,653
Pussy!

17
00:01:34,186 --> 00:01:37,686
I give you 10 seconds
and then I come to you.

18
00:01:43,887 --> 00:01:45,887
I AM I'll be the destroyer!

19
00:01:49,993 --> 00:01:56,993
I'll catch you, Peter!
I am the destroyer of creatures!

00:02:07,031 --> 00:02:11,031
FEAST
with Peter Grey

21
00:02:19,338 --> 00:02:21,988
Welcome to the 'Feast'
with Peter Grey.

22
00:02:22,159 --> 00:02:28,359
In today's feast: srneæi steaks
Brulee cream and maple syrup.

23
00:02:28,422 --> 00:02:35,422
These srneæe steaks from Sullivan County
I'm shot and tranèirao.

24
00:02:35,751 --> 00:02:39,751
Gee, Peter! - What is it?
- But it's Bambi!

25
00:02:44,814 --> 00:02:49,274
Come on, Peg. I mean, hunting
basic human behavior!

26
00:02:49,318 --> 00:02:53,318
- We do already thousand years!
- It is wretched!

27
00:02:54,542 --> 00:02:57,542
This is... ecological,
i. ..

28
00:02:58,252 --> 00:02:59,742
... sustainable.

29
00:02:59,782 --> 00:03:04,282
If you want horror, and looks at a slaughterhouse
commercials every 5 minutes

30
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:08,320
and I'm sure you will not ever again
eating meat from a supermarket.

31
00:03:09,616 --> 00:03:12,166
When we return
Feast continues...

32
00:03:12,196 --> 00:03:18,196
... Cream Brulee with the resulting
of local maple syrup.

33
00:03:18,345 --> 00:03:20,345
Do not leave.

34
00:03:28,553 --> 00:03:31,813
Really no longer like this.
He uopæe not co-operating with me.

35
00:03:31,852 --> 00:03:34,762
- What was it the fuck?
- What?

36
00:03:34,897 --> 00:03:37,947
- I was joking, moron!
- Sally?

37
00:03:38,136 --> 00:03:40,436
- Tell him I said.
- What can we say?

38
00:03:40,459 --> 00:03:42,959
Peter, would you kill
you're playing a little.

39
00:03:43,008 --> 00:03:45,278
No, tell him what I said.

40
00:03:45,348 --> 00:03:46,998
It was hysterical.

41
00:03:47,002 --> 00:03:49,392
No, I was joking.
The crowd followed me.

42
00:03:49,405 --> 00:03:53,605
It was a fucking idiot!
Such was.

43
00:03:54,235 --> 00:03:55,235
I can no longer work
with this asshole.

44
00:03:55,670 --> 00:03:56,870
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

45
00:03:57,406 --> 00:03:58,126
Thank you.

46
00:03:58,129 --> 00:04:00,629
What you èiniš
not called the 'work'!

47
00:04:01,363 --> 00:04:04,303
Only from her that I miss
Site Meter is the ocarina!

48
00:04:04,311 --> 00:04:05,711
Nice. That would help.

49
00:04:05,754 --> 00:04:08,754
Bring a second, Phil.
There are dozens.

50
00:04:11,034 --> 00:04:12,364
Such is no longer going.

51
00:04:12,372 --> 00:04:15,972
Behold, Peter, you know what you signed,

52
00:04:16,102 --> 00:04:19,702
I cook and take care Peg
for attention.

53
00:04:19,830 --> 00:04:23,090
But she went too far,
All was turned joke, Phil.

54
00:04:23,136 --> 00:04:25,406
This audience wants.

55
00:04:25,718 --> 00:04:27,478
But that's not what I want!

56
00:04:27,498 --> 00:04:31,868
It should be a show, I would
So teach your audience something!

57
00:04:32,978 --> 00:04:37,908
They do not want something to learn, Peter!
They want to be entertained!

58
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:40,500
Sometimes you have to understand
But have you changed?

59
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:45,430
- That's what I've been listening.
- Viewership drops us, man!

60
00:04:45,523 --> 00:04:48,843
I do not care for the audience!
Do not tell me about the audience!

61
00:04:48,890 --> 00:04:50,320
Okay, okay.

62
00:04:51,511 --> 00:04:53,001
You know what?

63
00:04:53,134 --> 00:04:58,484
Rumors of the administration say thanks
your 'great concern' for ratings

64
00:04:58,536 --> 00:05:02,536
unlikely to support
Peter Gray show from cancellation.

65
00:05:03,846 --> 00:05:05,456
Hope you're not serious?

66
00:05:05,596 --> 00:05:07,596
I'm dead serious.

67
00:05:08,047 --> 00:05:10,547
Congratulations, sir 'inviolable'.

68
00:05:25,916 --> 00:05:27,436
What the hell?

69
00:05:29,469 --> 00:05:32,469
What happens? We have dinner,
Give little enthusiasm. Hop-hop!

70
00:05:38,511 --> 00:05:40,991

Where is everybody?

81
00:06:36,204 --> 00:06:37,704
It changes nothing, dude!

82
00:06:37,751 --> 00:06:41,611
He creates Customer review!
In other words - it changes everything!

83
00:06:41,638 --> 00:06:43,758
Gordon, he's a fucking
blogger on the food!

84
00:06:43,793 --> 00:06:46,123
You just do not understand.
This is a fucking disaster!

What if it is. Anyway, I want to
focus on their cooking.

88
00:06:52,945 --> 00:06:56,525
Focus on cooking?
Is' fucking kidding me?

89

Bill Hade called and said it was decided
expansion plan put on hold.

90

Which means - are dead. Forget the line
Peter Grey vessels.

91
00:07:04,623 --> 00:07:07,853
Kompa, without your TV faces
every day on the screens

92
00:07:07,895 --> 00:07:11,555
you have no fucking nothing! No items
that will attract attention to us!

93
00:07:11,614 --> 00:07:14,214
This is nonsense, Gordon!
So we have only begun!

94
00:07:14,278 --> 00:07:16,438
Peter, to give you a hint -

95
00:07:16,459 --> 00:07:20,879
This whole thing with
ecologically sustainable steaks...

96
00:07:20,951 --> 00:07:25,291
When it comes to economics. People don `t care
from where hamburgers come from.

97
00:07:25,370 --> 00:07:27,770
They just want to be delicious.

98
00:07:28,955 --> 00:07:30,535
And now what?

99
00:07:32,355 --> 00:07:37,355
'Monsieur chef' of the restaurant was
here this afternoon. Has taken steps.

100
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:43,020
- I was fired?
- My hands are tied.

101
00:07:45,528 --> 00:07:46,998
Gordon...

102
00:07:48,084 --> 00:07:49,584
this is my life.

103
00:07:49,827 --> 00:07:51,827
Kompa, talentiram you.

104
00:07:51,967 --> 00:07:56,667
're A little conceited. Šljiviš it - so you
conceited. In fact I agree with Franks.

105
00:07:56,851 --> 00:07:59,851
However, you'll already be snaæi you.

106
00:11:01,630 --> 00:11:04,630
Stop! I banged my elbow!

BITTER FEAST
Translation: DAMIROWSKI

109
00:14:02,857 --> 00:14:04,597
How is everything?

110
00:14:04,628 --> 00:14:07,628
- What?
- Do you need... anything else?

111
00:14:08,164 --> 00:14:11,034
I'd like a bit of pleasure.

112
00:14:11,184 --> 00:14:12,684
Excuse me?

113
00:14:13,038 --> 00:14:17,338
Maybe a big plate of satisfaction
he was great.

114
00:14:20,110 --> 00:14:21,610
N-I do not understand.

115
00:14:22,748 --> 00:14:24,208
I know.

116
00:14:57,275 --> 00:15:00,275
Can I get...
account, please.

117
00:15:02,477 --> 00:15:04,437
Of all the things on the menu

118
00:15:04,438 --> 00:15:10,317
omitted one that I
commissioned if they ever go back there -

119
00:15:10,375 --> 00:15:15,425
it would be a time machine that would be
returned back an hour and 7 minutes to praise

120
00:15:15,454 --> 00:15:20,454
Chief Daniel Burlow Pilforda to me
hosted the first visit.

121
00:15:21,748 --> 00:15:24,368
Another bad review,
very nice.

122
00:15:24,642 --> 00:15:28,642
Give public
what am I being asked.

123
00:15:28,855 --> 00:15:31,565
I learned that 'le jus' means juice

124
00:15:31,585 --> 00:15:34,755
so I can not say that the whole
experience was failure.

125
00:15:34,783 --> 00:15:37,163
Because the food was one word -
povratluk.

126
00:15:37,214 --> 00:15:39,624
'Povratluk', is this uopæe word?

127
00:15:39,654 --> 00:15:40,954
Yeah.

128
00:15:42,142 --> 00:15:45,142
How can you write such crap?

129
00:15:45,352 --> 00:15:46,962
Just play my role, my heart.

130
00:15:46,966 --> 00:15:49,136
And this role is?

131
00:15:49,271 --> 00:15:51,061
Iron Chic.

132
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:52,600
Who?

133
00:15:53,276 --> 00:15:56,256
Iron Chic, a professional wrestling...

134
00:15:57,283 --> 00:16:01,283
Type the violence
raise the public on its feet.

135
00:16:02,659 --> 00:16:04,149
Oh, I see.

136
00:16:05,364 --> 00:16:08,594
What happened to
your novel?

137
00:16:08,772 --> 00:16:12,472
- You know, the one...
- Yes, I know that!

138
00:16:12,982 --> 00:16:14,142
He was good.

139
00:16:14,154 --> 00:16:15,654
Shit!

140
00:16:19,762 --> 00:16:22,762
I think I'm in 'those' days,

141
00:16:23,208 --> 00:16:26,208
and you'd come home earlier,
so...

142
00:16:27,050 --> 00:16:28,550
OK.

143
00:16:31,683 --> 00:16:35,683
I'll leave you food
in the refrigerator.

144
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:37,800
Yeah.

145
00:16:39,571 --> 00:16:45,571
I'll go to the doctor,
I will come for inspection of the line.

146
00:16:46,961 --> 00:16:51,551
- Will you go with me?
- I do not like hospitals.

147
00:16:51,637 --> 00:16:52,997
I know, but,
I thought...

148
00:16:54,545 --> 00:16:55,995
Hey...

149
00:16:56,955 --> 00:16:58,055
In the end I was the deadline.

150
00:16:58,255 --> 00:17:00,755
I'll be there to pick you up.

151
00:17:13,302 --> 00:17:14,802
What is?

152
00:17:17,386 --> 00:17:20,456
Have you looked for a job
lately?

153
00:17:20,596 --> 00:17:23,536
For a long time
spend standing

154
00:17:23,548 --> 00:17:27,008
in my underwear watching me like that
viseæi on my shoulders.

155
00:17:27,131 --> 00:17:29,741
Would you uopæe another child?

156
00:17:29,858 --> 00:17:31,448
Jesus Christ!

157
00:17:31,533 --> 00:17:35,793
You've got to say because if you think
I enjoy odlazeæi to these treatments

158
00:17:35,816 --> 00:17:39,436
pikanja and èeprkanja...
- No! No.

159
00:17:41,385 --> 00:17:44,415
- I do not think that.
- Really?

160
00:17:45,871 --> 00:17:48,471
What's going on with you?

161
00:17:49,056 --> 00:17:52,056
Become so vicious.

162
00:17:54,078 --> 00:17:55,578
Yeah, well...

163
00:17:56,646 --> 00:17:58,946
shit is happening.

164
00:17:59,037 --> 00:18:02,037
And could die
cancer.

165
00:18:02,768 --> 00:18:04,218
Stop!

166
00:18:04,898 --> 00:18:06,538
Look at me!

167
00:18:07,385 --> 00:18:09,685
I said look at me!

168
00:18:10,512 --> 00:18:15,512
So I was tired of the poor,
bitter idiot routine! I...

169
00:18:16,858 --> 00:18:21,858
At ? rst we begin immediately.
At ? rst we begin, tell me yes or no.

170
00:18:24,736 --> 00:18:26,736
Only Re...
just answer me, ok?

171
00:18:26,854 --> 00:18:28,724
I... I had...

172
00:18:29,732 --> 00:18:32,222
I had that thought...

173
00:18:32,869 --> 00:18:36,349
A few minutes of watching and

188
00:27:38,861 --> 00:27:40,451

This is insane! Does this all right?
This is absolutely fucking madness, right?

195
00:28:03,271 --> 00:28:05,411
You'll fill the bucket,

196
00:28:05,424 --> 00:28:08,424
You'll carry it back

If you violate the rules
you will not get anything.

201

202
00:28:30,008 --> 00:28:31,908

207
00:29:35,813 --> 00:29:40,813
I'm not sure whether we see anything in the middle,
but I feel we're close to it.

208

209
00:30:08,502 --> 00:30:10,202

I do not care. I swear to God,
I will not tell anyone if you let me...

00:37:20,734 --> 00:37:24,714
As a critic you are not emotionally

356
00:50:01,395 --> 00:50:02,995
Hungry?

357
00:50:06,917 --> 00:50:09,397
Well, you know what...

358
00:50:11,210 --> 00:50:13,210
We still have these bebica.

359
00:50:14,069 --> 00:50:16,269
Right here in the refrigerator.

360
00:50:16,478 --> 00:50:18,998
Plus, we have a barbecue.

361
00:50:19,608 --> 00:50:22,938
Look at him, just as it should,
Medium hot.

362
00:50:23,733 --> 00:50:25,993
What a nice refrigerator.

363
00:50:28,063 --> 00:50:30,563
If you fail to do...

364
00:50:31,327 --> 00:50:33,827
... Steak is yours.

365
00:51:22,116 --> 00:51:24,616
Often I was in this forest,
Mr Franks...

366
00:51:27,043 --> 00:51:29,543
Me and my big brother Johnny.

367
00:51:31,068 --> 00:51:34,178
Johnny was somehow...
sometimes cruel kid

368
00:51:34,264 --> 00:51:39,264
the guy who pulled the legs
rats in. ..

369
00:51:39,966 --> 00:51:42,966
... and put in boxes
blind cat.

370
00:51:43,867 --> 00:51:46,287
This is probably happening.

371
00:51:48,364 --> 00:51:51,964
Radio is everything to me.
Evil, nasty things.

372
00:51:56,226 --> 00:51:58,996
One day he went too far
with me.

373
00:51:59,400 --> 00:52:00,900
Mojo is...

374
00:52:02,019 --> 00:52:05,019
... how anger can izaæi
the little boy.

375
00:52:06,994 --> 00:52:09,444
I dug his grave
bare hands.

376
00:52:12,018 --> 00:52:15,018
He covered his body
leaves the country...

377
00:52:17,699 --> 00:52:19,999
I did not even look for him.

378
00:52:22,693 --> 00:52:25,203
Both my parents...

379
00:52:25,786 --> 00:52:30,996
never knew whether their boy
alive or dead.

380
00:52:33,610 --> 00:52:37,110
But in the end, many years later,
they died,

381
00:52:37,302 --> 00:52:39,902
and with them the pain is resolved.

382
00:52:43,077 --> 00:52:47,677
There are two kinds of people
in this svijeetu, Mr Franks.

383
00:52:50,268 --> 00:52:55,568
One thing I added some
human experience...

384
00:52:56,740 --> 00:52:58,740
And it is destroying...

385
00:52:59,424 --> 00:53:02,394
... ambushed and shadows...

386
00:53:02,868 --> 00:53:06,008
... waiting for someone next to me
to get me two.

387
00:53:09,958 --> 00:53:13,458
Bockajuæi me with sticks...

388
00:53:13,787 --> 00:53:16,787
... would not you begged for mercy.

389
00:53:18,476 --> 00:53:20,976
These two kinds of people...

390
00:53:22,770 --> 00:53:25,250
... and should be opposed.

391
00:53:30,206 --> 00:53:34,806
Those who seek their reconciliation,
requires the destruction...

392
00:53:35,044 --> 00:53:37,344
... Existence...

393
00:53:37,417 --> 00:53:40,417
... and your steak is -
prepeèen!

394
00:53:58,257 --> 00:53:59,757
(Why?)

395
00:54:00,157 --> 00:54:01,657
What?

396
00:54:04,387 --> 00:54:06,847
What, Mr. Franks?
I can not hear you.

397
00:54:06,865 --> 00:54:09,865
If you want something to tell you,
then speak up!

398
00:54:19,266 --> 00:54:23,866
Thus, Mr. Franks, you are right,
we are animals!

399
00:54:28,126 --> 00:54:31,126
In particular I will reward you for this!

400
00:54:50,734 --> 00:54:54,294
Listen, they say that all good things
one must come an end.

401
00:54:54,483 --> 00:54:58,953
Despite the headaches,
show was really good.

402
00:54:59,077 --> 00:55:01,737
- GOOD!
- GOOD, too good! Absolutely!

403
00:55:01,774 --> 00:55:03,774
For Peter and Pegg,

404
00:55:03,991 --> 00:55:07,311
standing side by side no one
more of them to comply.

405
00:55:07,643 --> 00:55:09,343
Make a toast!

406
00:55:10,656 --> 00:55:12,356
Good job!

407
00:55:31,495 --> 00:55:33,955
What are you doing here?

408
00:55:34,574 --> 00:55:36,974
The door was open.

409
00:55:38,432 --> 00:55:42,162
You know, I used to be make-up.,
when I was a cop.

410
00:55:42,466 --> 00:55:46,976
While I was in the service of police
worked on domestic violence.

411
00:55:47,016 --> 00:55:50,016
Excuse me, sir...
Covley.

412
00:55:50,455 --> 00:55:52,955
Can you help at all?

413
00:55:54,595 --> 00:55:57,595
No need to be rude,
Mr Grey.

414
00:55:58,259 --> 00:56:02,529
I'm sorry, I have arranged a meeting
in which I arrive.

415
00:56:02,780 --> 00:56:04,310
Ma do?

416
00:56:04,346 --> 00:56:09,216
And how I know you lost the restaurant
and then the show.

417
00:56:09,282 --> 00:56:12,282
What does not kill me
makes me stronger.

418
00:56:13,647 --> 00:56:17,647
Then you must be damn strong,
if you look.

419
00:56:23,215 --> 00:56:25,715
What happened to you with your hand?

420
00:56:25,945 --> 00:56:27,945
I was burned.

421
00:56:32,889 --> 00:56:35,229
So, I dug a little...

422
00:56:35,434 --> 00:56:37,934
A terrible tragedy
it with your brother.

423
00:56:38,290 --> 00:56:39,620
Yes.

424
00:56:39,637 --> 00:56:42,937
Have similarities with JT Franks.

425
00:56:43,716 --> 00:56:45,026
Is it?

426
00:56:45,050 --> 00:56:48,990
Yes, his son died,
two years ago.

427
00:56:49,014 --> 00:56:51,014
Of leukemia.

428
00:56:52,989 --> 00:56:56,179
Oh, this is a very sad story.

429
00:56:56,539 --> 00:56:59,829
- I knew not even to have a wife.
- Yes, wonderful gentlemen.

430
00:56:59,832 --> 00:57:03,202
Funny, she is convinced
that the Franks fled.

431
00:57:03,305 --> 00:57:05,905
He did not want to be with her.

432
00:57:06,012 --> 00:57:08,012
I do not believe it.

433
00:57:08,128 --> 00:57:11,128
You see, I have supernatural
sense of smell.

434
00:57:11,157 --> 00:57:14,157
Smell the crap far and wide.

435
00:57:17,316 --> 00:57:19,996
- How did you burned?
- Kuhajuæi.

436
00:57:20,078 --> 00:57:22,498
- Kuhajuæi what?
- Souffle.

437
00:57:22,506 --> 00:57:24,246
- Of what?
- Sir.

438
00:57:24,254 --> 00:57:26,004
Was he good?

439
00:57:26,564 --> 00:57:27,964
Delicious.

440
00:57:32,762 --> 00:57:34,762
OK. And you...

441
00:57:36,831 --> 00:57:38,521
Watch out for that hand.

442
00:57:38,714 --> 00:57:40,714
It looks serious.

443
01:03:21,837 --> 01:03:24,027
Cheese souffle, Mr Grey!

444
01:04:57,446 --> 01:04:58,946
Hello?

445
01:05:02,729 --> 01:05:05,779
It's okay. It's okay.
I'll help you.

446
01:05:05,852 --> 01:05:08,852
I'll help you.
You'll get away from here.

447
01:05:14,753 --> 01:05:17,753
I have to solve these chains.
'll Be right back! I promise!

448
01:06:27,387 --> 01:06:28,887
He's dead.

449
01:06:29,635 --> 01:06:31,185
He's dead.

450
01:06:48,596 --> 01:06:50,996
Come on, fucking coward.

451
01:06:58,891 --> 01:07:00,891
You coward.

452
01:07:05,672 --> 01:07:07,172
Come on!

453
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:09,660
Come on!

454
01:07:10,541 --> 01:07:13,941
No one you can not save now,
Mr Franks.

and the balance of blackberry, in. ..

456
01:11:11,514 --> 01:11:16,514

<i>JT Franks recognizes

471
01:12:34,322 --> 01:12:35,822
Two preparations:

472
01:12:36,355 --> 01:12:41,995
Is identical in appearance except that one
includes an alternate 'Tropical Belladonna'

473
01:12:42,337 --> 01:12:45,837
or 'deadly shadow by night',
and the other the right berry.

474
01:12:45,969 --> 01:12:49,059
Drinking just one Belladonna
the child is lethal,

475
01:12:49,103 --> 01:12:52,503
and for adults -
the 10 to 20

476
01:12:53,430 --> 01:12:57,790
With this in mind, you can take
one bit from each plate

477
01:12:57,817 --> 01:13:01,817
that we discover that blackberries
which Belladonna.

478
01:13:03,279 --> 01:13:06,309
And what are you going to eat after
in full

479
01:13:06,393 --> 01:13:08,653
your choice of a fork.

480
01:13:08,689 --> 01:13:11,329
Has a third option, if you wish,

481
01:13:11,559 --> 01:13:14,059
You can refuse the challenge,

482
01:13:14,295 --> 01:13:17,075
choose a plate from memory

483
01:13:17,324 --> 01:13:20,924
In this case you will not eat anything.
Is that clear?

484
01:13:35,664 --> 01:13:37,664
Bon Appetite.

485
01:14:40,523 --> 01:14:42,993
Rinse mouth.

486
01:15:26,239 --> 01:15:32,239
Come on, Mr. Franks, for kušaèa like you
This is as easy as Maejima cough.

487
01:15:33,875 --> 01:15:35,995
It is a real blackberry.

488
01:15:40,525 --> 01:15:41,995
OK.

489
01:15:42,285 --> 01:15:44,285
Continue?

490
01:15:46,338 --> 01:15:47,938
Yes.

491
01:16:01,742 --> 01:16:03,292
Roll up.

492
01:17:17,089 --> 01:17:19,489
And now we wait.

493
01:17:39,618 --> 01:17:42,618
You look a little shaky,
Mr Franks.

494
01:17:56,301 --> 01:17:58,701
Short on air

495
01:17:58,941 --> 01:18:01,341

horrible taste only difference
between local and imported blackberries

499
01:18:19,073 --> 01:18:22,873
and you do not recognize something so obviously
such as Belladonna!

500
01:18:23,036 --> 01:18:26,836
Except of course if you are not
full serator!

501
01:18:34,079 --> 01:18:36,079
And now my review:

502
01:18:37,088 --> 01:18:38,688
JT Franks...

503
01:18:38,981 --> 01:18:41,861
so well known for knowledge of food
died today

504
01:18:41,882 --> 01:18:47,242
because his sense of taste is so weakened
he did not know the difference between

505
01:18:47,262 --> 01:18:50,262
shit and great food!

506
01:19:01,279 --> 01:19:04,279
To give you a review...

507
01:19:08,408 --> 01:19:11,408
Always the same...

01:19:14,791 --> 01:19:17,791
the splaèine...

509
01:19:22,708 --> 01:19:24,708
Poor little bunny...

510
01:19:26,974 --> 01:19:31,974
