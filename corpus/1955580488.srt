1
00:02:10,322 --> 00:02:15,577
No, come on now. Let's go. You promised.

2
00:02:21,917 --> 00:02:25,629
- I'll make you like nature.
- It does not like me.

3
00:02:41,770 --> 00:02:48,318
- The air is never so fresh in New York.
- Sure, if you say so, then.

4
00:02:48,402 --> 00:02:53,031
Do you want to go back?
To the house, not to the town.

5
00:02:59,246 --> 00:03:02,166
Does he think...

6
00:03:03,876 --> 00:03:07,463
Va?

7
00:03:07,546 --> 00:03:11,133
Tom! Empty!

8
00:03:26,815 --> 00:03:28,692
Tom!

9
00:03:35,365 --> 00:03:37,659
Tom!

10
00:04:18,951 --> 00:04:21,578
He does not breathe.

11
00:04:31,296 --> 00:04:35,968
I'm calling for someone.
Stay here, I'll fix it.

12
00:04:40,973 --> 00:04:43,767
Breathing.

13
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:22,431
- I think it needs sewing.
- It does not have to be sewn. Just put on...

14
00:05:22,514 --> 00:05:28,812
- Do they even learn psychologists like that?
- You do not know what they are learning psychologists.

15
00:05:28,937 --> 00:05:31,398
Turn it on.

16
00:05:31,482 --> 00:05:35,986
Aj! I'm just kidding, it did not hurt.

17
00:06:05,474 --> 00:06:08,060
Is it good?

18
00:06:08,143 --> 00:06:11,688
Yes. I just...

19
00:06:11,772 --> 00:06:16,318
- I'm thinking of that guy.
- I know it was close to the eye.

20
00:06:18,946 --> 00:06:24,868
- You risked the life of a stranger.
- I had no choice.

21
00:06:28,455 --> 00:06:34,044
You... If I had not been
such a fantastic swimmer-

22
00:06:34,128 --> 00:06:39,133
- I would not have jumped in,
but now I'm and I managed.

23
00:07:09,955 --> 00:07:12,624
Thank you.

24
00:07:12,708 --> 00:07:17,463
What you did was very brave.
I was scared only.

25
00:07:17,546 --> 00:07:20,549
I know.

26
00:07:21,592 --> 00:07:25,929
- I take it to the dry cleaner.
- It is his. The healthcare providers were wrong.

27
00:07:26,013 --> 00:07:31,977
I was going to stop at...
You, it's no danger. No problem.

28
00:07:46,075 --> 00:07:48,160
Hi, Mary.

29
00:07:48,243 --> 00:07:53,373
We almost wrote Dr. Thomas Seymour
before I saw it. Ian Wilkinson.

30
00:07:53,457 --> 00:07:59,046
- Have you received any values?
- He had Temazepam in the blood. Ten pieces.

31
00:08:05,761 --> 00:08:11,225
Hello. I thought you wanted this one.

32
00:08:11,350 --> 00:08:17,523
It was me who pulled you out of the water.
My wife was right upset.

33
00:08:17,606 --> 00:08:19,983
Doctor Seymour?

34
00:08:22,569 --> 00:08:26,782
It's me.

35
00:08:26,865 --> 00:08:32,663
- Danny? Danny Miller?
- Yes.

36
00:08:32,746 --> 00:08:36,917
Sorry, I did not know you were out.

37
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,546
They kept quiet about it.

38
00:08:40,629 --> 00:08:43,340
And Ian?

39
00:08:43,424 --> 00:08:49,555
Ian was the director's first name,
Wilkinson was the pastor's last name.

40
00:08:49,638 --> 00:08:54,726
- Now I am.
- Was it ten, twelve years ago?

41
00:08:54,810 --> 00:08:59,648
- It feels twice as long.
- Obvious.

42
00:08:59,731 --> 00:09:04,111
- Sorry, this is...
- Crazy, right?

43
00:09:04,194 --> 00:09:07,197
It makes one think.

44
00:09:07,281 --> 00:09:12,536
The pastor had said that the randomness is
the crack in the human where God comes in.

45
00:09:12,619 --> 00:09:16,832
Yes, he would have done that.

46
00:09:16,915 --> 00:09:21,503
You, I have to work.

47
00:09:21,587 --> 00:09:24,673
Under circumstances
you look good.

48
00:09:24,757 --> 00:09:28,010
Yes, according to the circumstances.

49
00:09:29,511 --> 00:09:32,931
Take care of you.

50
00:09:57,206 --> 00:10:01,668
My mom is a subba.
She does not believe he raped me.

51
00:10:01,752 --> 00:10:06,673
She said I found it. She can pull
to hell. Does he get conditional two years?

52
00:10:06,757 --> 00:10:11,970
She blames me and killed my dog.
She killed my damn dog.

53
00:10:12,054 --> 00:10:15,766
Therefore I cut the subban. Little justice.

54
00:10:15,849 --> 00:10:21,271
It's enough, Miss Demers.
- Can the lawyer and psychologist arrive?

55
00:10:22,272 --> 00:10:25,776
Doctor Seymour.

56
00:10:30,155 --> 00:10:33,033
Well, what do you say?

57
00:10:41,166 --> 00:10:45,212
I'm so tired of this case.
"My dog, my dog, my dog."

58
00:10:45,295 --> 00:10:50,092
- Do you think the mom's guy raped her?
- He broke his conditional judgment.

59
00:10:50,175 --> 00:10:56,390
- Young people have reason to kill anyone.
- Not in that area. I invite you.

60
00:10:56,473 --> 00:11:00,269
- Ian Wilkinson.
- Is he one of yours?

61
00:11:00,352 --> 00:11:04,690
Yes, and you did a good deed.

62
00:11:04,773 --> 00:11:09,987
- Did you mean to tell me?
- You know that I could not.

63
00:11:10,070 --> 00:11:12,531
Does the police know that he is?

64
00:11:12,614 --> 00:11:15,868
He was depressed and took a swim.

65
00:11:15,951 --> 00:11:20,080
- A swim? Angie, Danny is...
- His name is Ian Wilkinson now, okay?

66
00:11:20,164 --> 00:11:24,668
- When did we start with it?
- We do it occasionally.

67
00:11:24,752 --> 00:11:29,173
He was an exceptional, but bad young man.

68
00:11:29,256 --> 00:11:36,096
Smart. He has a chance if we keep
the police and the press outside.

69
00:11:38,015 --> 00:11:42,269
- He thinks you can help him.
- It's not possible.

70
00:11:42,352 --> 00:11:46,440
You should not tell anyone about this,
not even your wife.

71
00:11:47,483 --> 00:11:52,279
Drunk, Tom. You have earned it.
The water was deep.

72
00:11:54,114 --> 00:11:59,078
I have to go back to the right
and make it look like I'm working.

73
00:11:59,161 --> 00:12:02,206
Think about the matter.

74
00:13:00,764 --> 00:13:06,270
- When are you back on Thursday?
- No, I'm temporary for Bob this weekend.

75
00:13:06,353 --> 00:13:11,066
You work fewer hours so we
need the money. You should come down.

76
00:13:11,150 --> 00:13:14,862
Now this weekend? Is it
premiere or something?

77
00:13:14,987 --> 00:13:19,074
I will finish the chapter on child abuse
and have not listened to the tape yet.

78
00:13:19,199 --> 00:13:25,748
- No, it's just a good time.
- I get it.

79
00:13:25,831 --> 00:13:31,253
I hate to discuss it like this,
with calendars and thermometers.

80
00:13:31,336 --> 00:13:36,258
No, I want to. I do.

81
00:13:36,341 --> 00:13:41,305
Whatever is required and how many times
is required, I'm the right one.

82
00:13:41,388 --> 00:13:45,851
I'm trying to get ready
the next few days and come down, okay?

83
00:14:01,283 --> 00:14:05,412
I'm driving you there.
We stay at a guesthouse and get started.

84
00:14:05,496 --> 00:14:11,460
Stop. It's fine. Finish what you
must finish and try to get down.

85
00:14:11,543 --> 00:14:15,172
You are beautiful, do you know that?

86
00:14:55,212 --> 00:15:01,844
It's too simple to assume that Nicole lacks conscience.
Many children with problems...

87
00:15:06,098 --> 00:15:12,521
Then the question becomes how to determine
the difference between access...

88
00:15:24,074 --> 00:15:26,660
Danny, what are you doing here?

89
00:15:26,744 --> 00:15:32,750
Hello. I was nearby and you forgot your
letter at the hospital the other day.

90
00:15:32,875 --> 00:15:36,879
Your address was on it.
Did not you hear the doorbell?

91
00:15:36,962 --> 00:15:42,509
- It looked important, as a bill.
- Thanks.

92
00:15:42,593 --> 00:15:49,057
- You look better. How are you?
- When I came out, I slept like a death.

93
00:15:49,141 --> 00:15:54,563
Okay. Thank you for this,
now I have to work on.

94
00:15:57,149 --> 00:15:59,651
What?

95
00:15:59,777 --> 00:16:04,573
You are the only one I can talk to
about what happened.

96
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:10,704
Can I come in?

97
00:16:10,829 --> 00:16:15,876
Certainly. Obvious. Take a seat.

98
00:16:21,632 --> 00:16:26,553
Danny, I can give you the name of someone
else who can help. What are you doing?

99
00:16:26,637 --> 00:16:30,057
Please do not smoke here.

100
00:16:30,140 --> 00:16:32,893
Anyone else, then?

101
00:16:32,976 --> 00:16:37,689
I'm the knife that has been thrown into the ocean.
It's Sigmund Freud, the doctor.

102
00:16:37,773 --> 00:16:42,277
I know, but you do not end up in that
category. Please wipe the cigarette.

103
00:16:43,737 --> 00:16:49,910
- I want you to know... Can we...
- No. I'm not your therapist.

104
00:16:49,993 --> 00:16:53,872
Forgive. Oh my God.

105
00:16:57,292 --> 00:17:02,798
They sentenced me to a crime
I had not committed and you...

106
00:17:02,881 --> 00:17:07,261
You judged me more or less.

107
00:17:07,344 --> 00:17:10,556
Can you help me get on my feet?

108
00:17:10,681 --> 00:17:14,393
I gave them my opinion, that is all.

109
00:17:14,476 --> 00:17:19,398
You know I'm innocent.
Do you have to know?

110
00:17:19,481 --> 00:17:24,903
No, I do not know and I want
that you leave my home now. Understood?

111
00:17:24,987 --> 00:17:28,031
Now.

112
00:17:29,450 --> 00:17:33,036
What the hell?

113
00:17:36,707 --> 00:17:40,335
What the hell?

114
00:18:06,278 --> 00:18:10,574
- Hi, Louis.
- I got you there.

115
00:18:10,657 --> 00:18:14,411
Seriously? Good work.

116
00:18:14,495 --> 00:18:17,706
See you, Louis.

117
00:18:25,798 --> 00:18:30,302
- Hi, mom!
- Here I am.

118
00:18:31,428 --> 00:18:34,556
Did Louis try to talk to you?

119
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:40,020
He comes in when he breaks and talks
about the past, it's so depressing.

120
00:18:40,104 --> 00:18:45,359
- Soon I will hire a Mexican or something.
- Mom...

121
00:18:45,442 --> 00:18:49,321
- Where is my daughter in law?
- In New York.

122
00:18:49,405 --> 00:18:53,951
- Previously the men went on business trips.
- Do not start now again.

123
00:18:54,076 --> 00:18:56,745
Even though the women did the whole job.

124
00:18:56,829 --> 00:19:00,624
Wait a minute,
what have you done with your wrist?

125
00:19:00,707 --> 00:19:05,838
I slipped and hit me. I can not
stay for dinner, should I fix something?

126
00:19:05,921 --> 00:19:11,343
For God's sake, I can handle myself.
But thank you for shopping for me.

127
00:19:12,636 --> 00:19:17,766
- I love you.
- Okay, kid. Bye.

128
00:19:17,891 --> 00:19:23,814
My advice is to think less and fuck more.
Look at me, I have four children.

129
00:19:23,897 --> 00:19:27,818
- I did not think of them.
- And three wives.

130
00:19:27,901 --> 00:19:31,488
You look more distracted
and bleak than usual.

131
00:19:31,572 --> 00:19:38,328
Do you remember Danny Miller? I ran on
him. He's out, under a different name.

132
00:19:38,412 --> 00:19:43,333
He is not your patient?
Write about him instead, then.

133
00:19:43,417 --> 00:19:48,714
You can sell that easily.
Nothing is more nasty than the truth?

134
00:19:48,797 --> 00:19:52,926
It was a joke, for God's sake.
Do not talk to him at all.

135
00:19:53,051 --> 00:19:58,056
- It's the past, leave it there.
- He said that my testimony judged him.

136
00:19:58,140 --> 00:20:01,685
It's good to take a little?

137
00:20:01,769 --> 00:20:04,605
He was no angel right away.

138
00:20:04,688 --> 00:20:09,485
But it bother me.
He was my last case on that page.

139
00:20:09,568 --> 00:20:14,531
I think of him. Maybe it went too fast.
Maybe we were too tough for him.

140
00:20:14,615 --> 00:20:19,495
He acknowledged that he was there, put the
pillow over her face and took on her.

141
00:20:19,578 --> 00:20:23,999
He did not have her skin under the nails.
There was no decisive evidence.

142
00:20:24,083 --> 00:20:28,796
- His fingerprints were in the entire room.
- Take it easy now, hardding.

143
00:20:29,963 --> 00:20:33,383
If we continue, I have to pay.

144
00:20:33,467 --> 00:20:37,846
- And the chicken?
- I do not want to hear about the chicken.

145
00:20:37,930 --> 00:20:42,226
The fact is that you did the right thing.
You did.

146
00:20:42,351 --> 00:20:44,770
There are always questions.

147
00:20:44,853 --> 00:20:50,651
I have one for you. Do you really think
he "ran on" you or did he find you?

148
00:20:50,734 --> 00:20:55,447
- He said it was a coincidence.
- As if there is any chance.

149
00:20:55,531 --> 00:21:01,912
- Say if you need a firearm.
- What's wrong with you?

150
00:21:01,995 --> 00:21:07,209
Thank goodness, there are still
journalists who look like that.

151
00:21:32,860 --> 00:21:37,030
- Sweetheart, are you?
- It's Angela.

152
00:21:37,156 --> 00:21:41,493
- Enter? What?
- Ian.

153
00:21:41,577 --> 00:21:46,665
Ian Wilkinson appeared at Morgan
Hamilton Prison and wanted to be locked.

154
00:21:46,749 --> 00:21:52,004
He tried to hand in a guard.
They want to take him in.

155
00:21:52,087 --> 00:21:54,256
Maybe they should?

156
00:21:54,339 --> 00:21:59,928
They will take him unless his
supervisor or therapist fetches him.

157
00:22:00,012 --> 00:22:05,350
- Okay, but I'm not his therapist.
- He told them.

158
00:22:05,434 --> 00:22:09,772
I can not take it here.
Please help me with this.

159
00:22:09,897 --> 00:22:15,611
- So... You have to joke.
- You are involved, no matter what you want.

160
00:22:17,696 --> 00:22:19,907
I have to put on.

161
00:22:22,534 --> 00:22:25,662
Hell.

162
00:23:18,048 --> 00:23:22,636
Drive into the roadside, I have to pee.

163
00:23:22,719 --> 00:23:25,055
Yes, okay.

164
00:25:03,946 --> 00:25:08,867
- Sorry, was it okay?
- Yes, it did.

165
00:25:10,452 --> 00:25:13,914
Do you know what? Give me a blow.

166
00:25:20,963 --> 00:25:26,176
- I thought you might have been stuck.
- Yes maybe.

167
00:25:36,437 --> 00:25:42,151
Remember your last therapy call?
That before trial?

168
00:25:44,570 --> 00:25:50,075
I had your arms around your waist
and you looked at me.

169
00:25:50,159 --> 00:25:55,664
You looked at me and went your way. I
neither heard of you or saw you again.

170
00:25:58,125 --> 00:26:02,588
I was eleven years old, Tom.

171
00:26:06,341 --> 00:26:11,513
Okay, but now you're out. You are here.

172
00:26:13,432 --> 00:26:17,519
Do me a favor and open the window.

173
00:26:27,362 --> 00:26:33,285
And no smoking in my office, okay?
Ever.

174
00:26:45,798 --> 00:26:50,052
I started burning fingertips
in prison.

175
00:26:51,428 --> 00:26:54,389
I do not know why I do.

176
00:26:54,556 --> 00:27:00,187
It's clean in here, very stylish.
Like a hotel

177
00:27:00,270 --> 00:27:03,565
Safe and nice.

178
00:27:03,649 --> 00:27:07,319
No distractions.

179
00:27:07,403 --> 00:27:09,822
No distractions.

180
00:27:09,905 --> 00:27:14,743
Why did you try to get
back to prison again?

181
00:27:14,827 --> 00:27:20,165
Yes, and I jumped in the river
to cool me down.

182
00:27:20,249 --> 00:27:24,670
- Still taking Temazepam?
- Yes, 20 milligrams.

183
00:27:24,795 --> 00:27:31,260
- Where do you live? Do you have any work?
- At the port.

184
00:27:31,343 --> 00:27:37,808
- Is there anyone at home? Your mom?
- She's dead.

185
00:27:37,891 --> 00:27:42,855
- I'm sorry.
- I had to visit her with handcuffs on.

186
00:27:42,938 --> 00:27:45,524
The handcuffs killed my mother - and my dad
was not even there when she died.

187
00:27:45,649 --> 00:27:50,070
He lives in Norwich and
has a narcissistic coma he calls a bar.

188
00:27:50,154 --> 00:27:54,324
He visited Windsor and pretended
that I was in some nice internat.

189
00:27:54,408 --> 00:28:00,330
But when they take one to prison...

190
00:28:00,414 --> 00:28:04,209
When you reach 18
you know that life is over.

191
00:28:04,293 --> 00:28:08,839
I did not know you ended up in prison.

192
00:28:08,922 --> 00:28:12,634
- Do not lie, Doctor Seymour.
- I do not lie. It's not a dash.

193
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:17,389
Being sorry does not give me life back.
I did not do it!

194
00:28:21,935 --> 00:28:26,815
- I did not, you know!
- The technical evidence was convincing.

195
00:28:34,364 --> 00:28:37,242
Time is out.

196
00:29:17,032 --> 00:29:22,329
ACHIEVEMENT

197
00:29:32,297 --> 00:29:34,883
Kat Kennedy is with Lauren Seymour.

198
00:30:09,376 --> 00:30:14,673
Do you know, you'll have your eyes open
while we do it.

199
00:30:14,798 --> 00:30:20,763
- God, sorry. I...
- The book is work. This is going to be fun.

200
00:30:20,846 --> 00:30:22,973
I know you're right.

201
00:30:23,098 --> 00:30:27,728
- You should have come down.
- I know it was time to try.

202
00:30:27,811 --> 00:30:32,733
No, no. Because it was fun.

203
00:30:32,816 --> 00:30:38,447
It's fun in New York.
It is cloudy in New London.

204
00:30:38,530 --> 00:30:43,535
Stop for a while. Wait.

205
00:30:43,619 --> 00:30:49,666
I may be a little jealous
when I see you with all the young artists.

206
00:30:49,750 --> 00:30:54,797
A jealous Thomas Seymour?
I like that.

207
00:31:48,434 --> 00:31:52,146
Oh!

208
00:31:52,229 --> 00:31:57,901
- Is everything okay?
- The thoughts are clear. Fall asleep, you.

209
00:32:56,293 --> 00:33:01,632
- Sweetheart, do you move out a blackboard at a time?
- She has an exhibition.

210
00:33:01,715 --> 00:33:08,138
We ran to each other on Pete's at the river.
It's Ian, do you remember him?

211
00:33:08,222 --> 00:33:11,767
Yes, of course.

212
00:33:11,892 --> 00:33:14,103
How are you, Ian?

213
00:33:14,186 --> 00:33:18,565
He is going to apply for some schools.
I said we can call around a bit.

214
00:33:18,649 --> 00:33:23,570
Sure, that sounds good. What is the
exhibition you are talking about?

215
00:33:23,654 --> 00:33:27,699
Bob had set,
so I exhibited something.

216
00:33:27,783 --> 00:33:33,288
- Sure, is it fun?
- It is an exhibition for the faculty.

217
00:33:33,372 --> 00:33:37,876
That sounds great,
I'll definitely be there.

218
00:33:39,628 --> 00:33:44,591
- Ian is working night shift, I drive him home.
- No, I'm pushing him.

219
00:33:44,675 --> 00:33:49,346
- Are not you going to court today?
- Yes, but I let him down the road.

220
00:33:49,430 --> 00:33:55,644
- I have to go back to town, quite crazy.
- Yes it is.

221
00:33:59,731 --> 00:34:02,276
I'd rather drink a real mold.

222
00:34:07,614 --> 00:34:11,243
There I work and there I drink.

223
00:34:14,705 --> 00:34:19,460
- No kids, so?
- No.

224
00:34:19,543 --> 00:34:25,132
Sometimes I wonder why my parents
got me. What were they looking for?

225
00:34:28,385 --> 00:34:32,848
So your daddy does not
want to meet you at all?

226
00:34:32,973 --> 00:34:38,228
Dad wants to delete me.
He never really wanted to meet me.

227
00:34:38,312 --> 00:34:42,691
He made the garage to a workshop
and locked the door.

228
00:34:42,775 --> 00:34:47,237
He sat most in there
and talked about Falluja.

229
00:34:47,321 --> 00:34:51,325
About when he shot a hole in a boy's chest-

230
00:34:51,408 --> 00:34:55,454
- and he slid down the wall
like a red spottloska.

231
00:34:55,537 --> 00:34:58,791
Dad loved to chase. I hated it.

232
00:34:58,874 --> 00:35:02,336
Once, I was maybe six years old-

233
00:35:02,419 --> 00:35:07,257
- He drove in to the roadside, picked up a
gun and shot six deer in seconds.

234
00:35:07,341 --> 00:35:11,136
As if we were in jail.

235
00:35:11,220 --> 00:35:16,433
I stood right next to him.
They are so beautiful at close range.

236
00:35:16,517 --> 00:35:20,687
He forced me to push one in his head,
so it ended up getting up.

237
00:35:20,771 --> 00:35:27,152
Maybe because of the adrenaline,
but I could not stop crying.

238
00:35:28,487 --> 00:35:34,618
The blood splashed in my face.
Dad saw it and got pissed off.

239
00:35:36,203 --> 00:35:40,124
Continue forward, only.

240
00:35:40,207 --> 00:35:45,879
I have read that we only use ten percent of the brain.
Have you thought about it?

241
00:35:46,004 --> 00:35:49,258
Yes, actually.

242
00:35:50,801 --> 00:35:54,847
It's like buying a big suit.

243
00:35:54,930 --> 00:35:58,308
Like it's going to be a beautiful day.

244
00:35:58,392 --> 00:36:02,729
- What do you think the other 90 percent are?
- I do not know.

245
00:36:02,813 --> 00:36:06,442
I think it's animal.

246
00:36:06,525 --> 00:36:13,198
Without the tiny portion
we are animals all.

247
00:36:13,282 --> 00:36:19,496
Like when we sleep or when I was
in the river. No thoughts, just animalism.

248
00:36:21,540 --> 00:36:25,711
- Did you revive me with CPR?
- Yes.

249
00:36:25,794 --> 00:36:29,339
Was not your wife?

250
00:36:29,423 --> 00:36:33,719
- Why do you ask?
- I am just curious.

251
00:36:33,802 --> 00:36:38,307
Your wife is a friendly lady.
She's nice, you've been lucky.

252
00:36:38,390 --> 00:36:43,896
She is handsome. Sorry.
I live in that damn rucklet.

253
00:36:48,734 --> 00:36:54,615
Hi, handsome. Put down the boxes,
and I'll pick them up for you.

254
00:36:54,698 --> 00:36:58,368
You are a prince, Ian.

255
00:36:58,452 --> 00:37:01,747
Stop coming home to me, understood?

256
00:37:01,830 --> 00:37:06,293
I want to help you,
but you do not stop, it's over.

257
00:37:06,376 --> 00:37:11,882
- You're bad, Doctor Seymour.
- Is that understood?

258
00:37:16,887 --> 00:37:20,557
Oh. Thank you, raring.

259
00:37:22,601 --> 00:37:28,649
You have violated your conditional release.
You have the right to a lawyer.

260
00:37:28,732 --> 00:37:35,197
If you can not afford a lawyer, will be
entitled to appoint a public defender.

261
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:40,035
- He tried to rape his niece.
- You were right about him.

262
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:45,290
- Do Nicky know about it?
- Probably. Lucky that she was in prison.

263
00:37:45,374 --> 00:37:49,711
I say that too often now.

264
00:37:49,795 --> 00:37:55,259
And Ian? Have you talked to him?

265
00:37:55,342 --> 00:37:59,888
- You asked me to pick him up, remember?
- Yes. And thanks.

266
00:37:59,972 --> 00:38:03,809
But since then?

267
00:38:03,892 --> 00:38:09,731
- What is it?
- Has he said anything about me?

268
00:38:09,815 --> 00:38:15,529
Because we have talked every night.

269
00:38:15,612 --> 00:38:19,908
Deep conversation.

270
00:38:19,992 --> 00:38:24,997
Recently he has been short.
Almost remote.

271
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:30,502
- I might have upset him.
- Angela, you are his supervisor.

272
00:38:30,586 --> 00:38:36,425
- How did he get out?
- Windsor's rector was fighting for him.

273
00:38:36,508 --> 00:38:40,929
She called out some services. Me too.

274
00:38:41,013 --> 00:38:45,976
- So he has not mentioned me?
- Angela, look at me. What's going on?

275
00:38:46,059 --> 00:38:50,355
- What?
- He's a job, a case.

276
00:38:50,439 --> 00:38:53,484
I'm worried. He is a good guy.

277
00:38:53,567 --> 00:38:58,822
- How can you be so sure?
- Tom, how many such cases do we see by day?

278
00:38:58,906 --> 00:39:03,827
This kid is special.

279
00:39:03,911 --> 00:39:10,209
- He may have a chance. Am I wrong?
- I do not know. I do not know where I think.

280
00:39:42,658 --> 00:39:47,079
Young man from Connecticut
charged with murder of older woman.

281
00:39:56,505 --> 00:40:02,886
He forced me to hold a hen.
When he came back, then.

282
00:40:02,970 --> 00:40:07,641
He was different. Nasty.
He tied my hands to it.

283
00:40:07,724 --> 00:40:12,020
- And hit the head of it.
I held it while it shook.

284
00:40:12,104 --> 00:40:16,191
Then blew it.

285
00:40:16,316 --> 00:40:20,154
And you understood that it was wrong?

286
00:40:21,864 --> 00:40:26,034
You are safe here, Danny.
You understand that?

287
00:41:04,698 --> 00:41:08,786
- Mrs. Green?
- Yes. Get up, Doctor Seymour.

288
00:41:11,997 --> 00:41:16,752
- You are more stylish than the picture on your book.
- No thanks.

289
00:41:16,877 --> 00:41:23,008
- Thank you for receiving with short notice.
- I do not know what I can tell.

290
00:41:23,133 --> 00:41:29,515
- Do you treat Danny?
- Yes. Yes I do.

291
00:41:29,598 --> 00:41:35,646
- So you taught him here at Windsor?
- He was one of my smartest students.

292
00:41:35,729 --> 00:41:41,527
Nothing is like killing a brain that
extinguishes everything and asks for more.

293
00:41:41,610 --> 00:41:46,323
- How old was he then?
- Thirteen and fourteen.

294
00:41:47,616 --> 00:41:51,078
Was there anything more
with him at the time?

295
00:41:51,161 --> 00:41:54,248
- What did you notice?

296
00:41:54,415 --> 00:41:59,211
He made people think they helped him
until they tore themselves out.

297
00:41:59,294 --> 00:42:04,883
Or worse yet.
Three in the staff, to be exact.

298
00:42:04,967 --> 00:42:08,345
My husband is still feeling guilty.

299
00:42:08,470 --> 00:42:13,559
- For what he did with the child.
- Yes, that's terrible.

300
00:42:13,642 --> 00:42:19,565
- I know it's hard to talk about.
- I blame Mr McDonald.

301
00:42:19,648 --> 00:42:22,735
I still want to forgive Danny.

302
00:42:22,818 --> 00:42:27,614
The other boy was such a boy
who always posed problems.

303
00:42:27,698 --> 00:42:31,368
But Danny...

304
00:42:33,036 --> 00:42:38,792
He knives the boy. He walked
across the room and knivled him.

305
00:42:38,876 --> 00:42:44,882
Thank God, the child survived.
My husband got crushed.

306
00:42:44,965 --> 00:42:49,011
But I blame Angus, you understand.

307
00:42:49,094 --> 00:42:55,434
- Because he made it happen?
- Ville. He wanted it to happen.

308
00:42:56,810 --> 00:43:00,939
Angus McDonald came here as a teacher.

309
00:43:01,023 --> 00:43:06,528
But he forced Danny
to write awful things about what happened.

310
00:43:06,612 --> 00:43:10,157
Angus became too engaged.

311
00:43:11,992 --> 00:43:16,914
- Continue.
- I've probably said enough.

312
00:43:23,754 --> 00:43:28,175
This is Tom's mobile answer.
Enter a message and I will call.

313
00:43:28,258 --> 00:43:32,721
Tom, I'm angry with you but I do not want to.
You should be here.

314
00:43:32,805 --> 00:43:37,768
I should not leave this message,
but it goes well. Really good.

315
00:43:37,851 --> 00:43:41,355
He from "The Times" is here.

316
00:43:43,315 --> 00:43:47,361
She's a liar.
Why do not you believe me?

317
00:43:47,444 --> 00:43:51,698
- She said you're kidding a guy.
- You do not know what I had to do there.

318
00:43:51,782 --> 00:43:55,369
What they called me. What they did to me.

319
00:43:55,452 --> 00:43:59,998
- And Angus?
- He is a pig, a stalker and a gay.

320
00:44:00,082 --> 00:44:04,128
- Fan. You hate me. Why?
- I do not. Stop.

321
00:44:04,211 --> 00:44:09,425
- I want to know what happened to Windsor.
- You still believe I killed her.

322
00:44:10,592 --> 00:44:16,056
I did not. It was not me.
Someone else did, I do not know who.

323
00:44:16,140 --> 00:44:21,854
I have to go to work!
I thought you would help me.

324
00:44:21,937 --> 00:44:27,276
Can you calm down? Calm down.
Danny, calm down.

325
00:44:27,359 --> 00:44:30,237
Danny, Danny, Danny.

326
00:44:32,322 --> 00:44:37,453
They belonged to me, I do not know who
they belong to anymore. Damn table!

327
00:44:40,205 --> 00:44:43,667
Can you tell me what happened to Windsor?

328
00:44:43,751 --> 00:44:47,671
Why? So you can pretend to bother you?

329
00:44:47,755 --> 00:44:51,675
Please wait a little. Danny!

330
00:44:51,759 --> 00:44:54,970
Fan too.

331
00:45:45,020 --> 00:45:48,107
Angie.

332
00:45:48,190 --> 00:45:53,320
- Wait. I want to invite a glass.
- Tom...

333
00:45:53,404 --> 00:45:59,076
- Come on. Sit down. Have a glass with me.
- A glass.

334
00:46:00,327 --> 00:46:04,415
Well, have you heard of our guy?

335
00:46:04,498 --> 00:46:09,461
He's home with me. On the sofa.

336
00:46:09,545 --> 00:46:13,841
I do not know what you've said,
but he's trying to get on his feet.

337
00:46:13,924 --> 00:46:18,762
Digging in the past
does not help him. Not in that way.

338
00:46:18,846 --> 00:46:23,434
Going over there again, Tommy?
Come on.

339
00:46:23,517 --> 00:46:29,064
- Leave your hesitation about the decision there.
- Angie, it's not about it.

340
00:46:29,148 --> 00:46:32,735
What did he say to you?
Angela, what did he say?

341
00:46:32,860 --> 00:46:36,822
If you do not help, you will be hurt.

342
00:46:41,869 --> 00:46:45,497
Thanks for the liquor.

343
00:47:02,890 --> 00:47:07,728
Do not say it. Do not say that word. "Job".

344
00:47:07,811 --> 00:47:13,484
- I know, but I...
- What did I just say? Thanks, I'll take it.

345
00:47:28,123 --> 00:47:33,295
- Why all the new bags?
- Did you listen to my message?

346
00:47:33,378 --> 00:47:37,007
Whole message?

347
00:47:37,091 --> 00:47:41,887
- Colin Waters. Colin Waters Gallery.
- I know. Colin Waters. Great fun.

348
00:47:41,970 --> 00:47:46,934
- Do you know who Colin Waters is?
- Are you serious? Of course I know that.

349
00:47:47,017 --> 00:47:53,232
He does not exist, a bunch of guys calls it.
They have a gallery in Bushwick.

350
00:47:53,315 --> 00:47:58,112
They want to give me an exhibition and they
have a studio on top where I can work.

351
00:47:58,195 --> 00:48:00,406
In Brooklyn?

352
00:48:00,489 --> 00:48:03,992
Do you know how difficult
it is to get your own show?

353
00:48:04,076 --> 00:48:09,998
No, I did not know. What good
news, honey. Congratulations. Really.

354
00:48:20,134 --> 00:48:23,804
Herregud. They came before me.

355
00:48:23,887 --> 00:48:28,434
I have to bring work
and other things down there.

356
00:48:28,559 --> 00:48:32,062
You should have listened to the message.

357
00:48:33,355 --> 00:48:37,443
Hello. This is Tom. My husband Tom.

358
00:48:37,526 --> 00:48:40,988
Wait, how is the situation?

359
00:48:56,295 --> 00:49:00,507
- The armchair?
- I must have somewhere to sit?

360
00:49:00,591 --> 00:49:05,804
There is a one with kitchenette right now.
It is completely empty.

361
00:49:52,518 --> 00:49:55,854
It feels like you move out.

362
00:49:55,938 --> 00:49:59,566
Only if you do not follow me.

363
00:49:59,650 --> 00:50:05,030
Tom. Town. A room.

364
00:50:05,114 --> 00:50:11,036
A little like when we first met and did
not leave your apartment in a month.

365
00:50:11,120 --> 00:50:16,542
The show is only in June, it's over
a month. Why are you shaking your head?

366
00:50:16,625 --> 00:50:19,920
Shaking my head?

367
00:50:20,003 --> 00:50:26,176
This book starts to affect you,
all stories about children.

368
00:50:26,260 --> 00:50:31,014
You are right.
It's an incredible opportunity for you.

369
00:50:32,683 --> 00:50:38,313
I'm so tired.
Close me, you're nice.

370
00:50:59,293 --> 00:51:06,300
I want to bakery and buy those
muffins we love, to those in the gallery.

371
00:51:58,060 --> 00:52:01,563
- Who was it?
- Ian. Crazy, huh?

372
00:52:01,647 --> 00:52:06,318
- What did he want?
- I became too distracted by his charm.

373
00:52:06,402 --> 00:52:10,697
- What fan should that mean?
- What's with you?

374
00:52:10,781 --> 00:52:15,202
What's up with you? Can not you
spend time with peers sometimes?

375
00:52:15,285 --> 00:52:18,163
Go to hell. For real.

376
00:52:26,630 --> 00:52:32,719
Ladies and gentlemen,
train 179 at 20:17...

377
00:52:32,803 --> 00:52:37,057
Wait, Lauren. Forgive me.

378
00:52:37,141 --> 00:52:43,105
I have a lot of thoughts right now
and I think the book affects me.

379
00:52:43,188 --> 00:52:47,568
To write about the kids all day long
on me. It feels like I'm losing...

380
00:52:47,651 --> 00:52:51,947
Tom. It's time.

381
00:52:52,072 --> 00:52:58,328
- For what?
- Everything. Good things. Everything we have talked about.

382
00:53:02,958 --> 00:53:05,377
Tom?

383
00:53:06,879 --> 00:53:09,715
Tom?

384
00:53:10,966 --> 00:53:15,053
- Tom?
- Yes I know. I know you're right.

385
00:53:15,137 --> 00:53:18,682
See you in a couple of days.

386
00:53:34,907 --> 00:53:40,412
She's okay, even though she's an artist.
You should go and spend more time with her.

387
00:53:40,496 --> 00:53:46,210
- It's complicated, mom.
- Religion and politics are complicated.

388
00:53:46,293 --> 00:53:51,840
- And daddy?
- Complicated. But not me, I was simple.

389
00:53:53,592 --> 00:53:56,845
Do you see who's working out there?

390
00:53:56,929 --> 00:54:02,017
You remember Neil?
There are little Neil Bridges.

391
00:54:02,142 --> 00:54:06,438
You boys used to torture the stacker.

392
00:54:24,039 --> 00:54:29,420
- What does he do here?
- He needed a job.

393
00:54:29,503 --> 00:54:35,175
- That was the smallest I could do.
- I still hear his crying and screaming.

394
00:54:35,259 --> 00:54:40,222
I do not know who jumped in
after him. It was not me or you.

395
00:54:40,305 --> 00:54:43,392
It was my dad who jumped in.

396
00:54:48,480 --> 00:54:53,736
- Do you think of what had happened...
- No, not directly.

397
00:55:34,485 --> 00:55:39,865
- What do you have for tea?
- Black, Green, Chai, Mint, Earl Gray.

398
00:55:39,948 --> 00:55:44,119
But nothing with caffeine, huh? Hi.

399
00:55:44,244 --> 00:55:49,541
- Ian, hello.
- What are you doing in town?

400
00:55:49,666 --> 00:55:52,920
- Some herbal tea will be good.
- I invite you.

401
00:55:53,003 --> 00:55:59,176
- What are you doing in town?
- I have been on admission interview.

402
00:55:59,301 --> 00:56:03,472
- Well, how fun.
- Yes.

403
00:56:03,555 --> 00:56:09,019
- Thanks.
- What a coincidence. What clumsy.

404
00:56:09,103 --> 00:56:15,067
Yes, exactly. I want people to see my works,
otherwise I would not have done them.

405
00:56:15,150 --> 00:56:20,948
I had forgotten how loud it was here.
You have an eyelash loose.

406
00:56:21,031 --> 00:56:25,911
Good. Do I have to blow it? Thanks.

407
00:56:25,994 --> 00:56:29,998
I loved Enkaustik,
I want to re-introduce it.

408
00:56:30,082 --> 00:56:36,463
You put bivax and resin on the cloth,
it gives depth. You can melt it.

409
00:56:36,588 --> 00:56:41,593
- I have to say a thing.
- Yes?

410
00:56:42,886 --> 00:56:46,014
It does not matter.

411
00:56:46,098 --> 00:56:50,227
What? You should not do that.

412
00:56:52,020 --> 00:56:55,816
You are an incredible
source of inspiration.

413
00:56:55,899 --> 00:57:01,613
You make me feel that
everything is possible.

414
00:57:06,076 --> 00:57:09,204
I pay.

415
00:57:09,329 --> 00:57:12,416
Doctor Seymour has a great trip.

416
00:57:14,460 --> 00:57:15,919
Yes.

417
00:58:04,510 --> 00:58:07,763
- A hard night?
- I met old friends.

418
00:58:07,846 --> 00:58:12,476
- And Lauren?
- She's in New York. What did you want?

419
00:58:17,981 --> 00:58:23,779
Ian's father knows he's out. He called
prison and asked about his son.

420
00:58:23,862 --> 00:58:28,617
Has he called you?
I'm afraid he will try to find Ian.

421
00:58:28,700 --> 00:58:33,247
- Did not he stay with you?
- He moved home again, but is not there.

422
00:58:33,414 --> 00:58:39,044
He is not at work. He missed our meeting
today, it has never happened before.

423
00:58:40,879 --> 00:58:46,468
- Who is Angus McDonald?
- Has he talked about it?

424
00:58:46,552 --> 00:58:52,891
For fan, Tom. Knife cuts happen even
in youth prisons. Do not blow it up.

425
00:58:52,975 --> 00:58:57,062
- He has not applied for Angus?
- I do not know where he is.

426
00:58:57,146 --> 00:59:02,901
I'm watching Angus.
He is at school. Which type.

427
00:59:02,985 --> 00:59:09,992
The students come and go. He is always two
glasses away from his perverted thoughts.

428
00:59:10,075 --> 00:59:14,872
- Angela, your involvement in the case...
- Do not Analyze Me.

429
00:59:14,955 --> 00:59:19,376
- Think about your own involvement.
- He's probably not the one you want.

430
00:59:19,501 --> 00:59:23,464
Who is it?
Think about who you want him to be.

431
00:59:23,547 --> 00:59:29,428
- I do not want him to be anybody.
- Do me a favor. If he belongs...

432
00:59:29,511 --> 00:59:35,976
Keep him. Hold him up.
Do nothing until I get there.

433
01:00:00,292 --> 01:00:04,296
- Hi. Doctor Seymour?
- Yes.

434
01:00:04,379 --> 01:00:08,133
Professor McDonald is in there.
First visit?

435
01:00:08,258 --> 01:00:11,512
I have been to school a couple of times.

436
01:00:14,264 --> 01:00:18,644
- Jeremy?
- Yes. Is there any coffee left?

437
01:00:18,727 --> 01:00:23,232
Cold.
- He likes cold coffee.

438
01:00:23,315 --> 01:00:29,863
Doctor Seymour. Be careful and shut down.

439
01:00:29,947 --> 01:00:35,244
Worry is not for him,
he has been up all night.

440
01:00:35,327 --> 01:00:38,288
Yes. Danny Miller, then.

441
01:00:40,833 --> 01:00:45,212
- Yes.
- Where is he? Do you know that?

442
01:00:45,295 --> 01:00:48,215
Actually not.

443
01:00:48,298 --> 01:00:53,429
Everyone wants to know where Danny is.
Or is that who Danny is?

444
01:00:53,554 --> 01:00:56,682
Angus has read your first book.

445
01:00:56,765 --> 01:01:01,103
You have a very optimistic view on your profession
- Except for Danny. What do you want to know?

446
01:01:01,186 --> 01:01:06,066
How did a writer's course
lead to a knife crash?

447
01:01:07,109 --> 01:01:11,864
If I tell you,
do you give him my address then?

448
01:01:16,160 --> 01:01:20,330
Do you want to?

449
01:01:20,414 --> 01:01:23,083
As a therapist, you should know
that Danny is not the victim.

450
01:01:23,167 --> 01:01:27,296
He can be a seductive young man and...

451
01:01:27,379 --> 01:01:32,801
I do not know what he said, but nothing
happened between us. Nothing physical.

452
01:01:32,885 --> 01:01:39,224
After all I did for him
I'm being accused.

453
01:01:39,308 --> 01:01:43,937
You know what he is capable of,
I know. He wrote about you repeatedly.

454
01:01:44,021 --> 01:01:48,942
Danny is gifted with a huge talent.
A good writer, but a black hole.

455
01:01:49,026 --> 01:01:55,032
You are pulled in. He draws one.
- Jeremy!

456
01:02:01,163 --> 01:02:05,834
The story Danny wrote to me, and apologize for words - but he
saw me in the eyes, crossed the room and showed me his captain.

457
01:02:05,918 --> 01:02:10,297
But the thing is that
that he seemed to enjoy it.

458
01:02:10,380 --> 01:02:15,260
- Danny seemed to enjoy the action itself.
- That bastard pretended to be my friend.

459
01:02:15,344 --> 01:02:22,226
- Do not be alone with him.
- I'm not worried.

460
01:02:22,309 --> 01:02:26,688
Lucky for you.

461
01:02:26,772 --> 01:02:28,857
Doctor Seymour. Hi.

462
01:02:47,376 --> 01:02:50,754
Excuse me. I know it seems cymbic,
but can you sign your book?

463
01:02:50,879 --> 01:02:56,844
Sure, jump in.

464
01:02:56,927 --> 01:03:00,347
- It's cold out there.
- I have not seen this for a while.

465
01:03:02,141 --> 01:03:07,312
I have started reading it
and I really like it.

466
01:03:07,396 --> 01:03:11,900
But the stories the children are talking
about is more for adults than for theirs?

467
01:03:18,490 --> 01:03:24,705
- Maybe for boats. What was your name, now again?
- Rowena.

468
01:03:24,788 --> 01:03:30,085
I saw you speaking at school.
You were great.

469
01:04:20,385 --> 01:04:25,057
- Enter?
- We have problems.

470
01:04:25,140 --> 01:04:29,269
- Have you heard of Danny?
- No why?

471
01:04:29,353 --> 01:04:34,858
Danny's father has called my
private phone. He knows where Danny is.

472
01:04:36,318 --> 01:04:40,572
I do not know what he wants. Can you talk
to him before he does anything stupid?

473
01:04:40,656 --> 01:04:45,285
He is unstable.
I have tracked the phone to Norwich.

474
01:04:49,289 --> 01:04:54,044
- Do you have an address?
- I'll call you.

475
01:06:57,126 --> 01:07:01,713
Are you following me, your damn?
Do not you think I notice it?

476
01:07:01,797 --> 01:07:05,968
- I know who you are, Dr. Seymour.
- I want to talk about your son.

477
01:07:06,051 --> 01:07:11,390
My son is a wretch, a shame.
He must be in prison again.

478
01:07:11,473 --> 01:07:18,313
- You have apparently tried to contact him.
- Certainly you have had contact.

479
01:07:18,397 --> 01:07:22,776
You of all fools should understand
that it was good that he was in prison.

480
01:07:22,901 --> 01:07:28,615
- He's out and we're trying to help him.
- He must stop, okay?

481
01:07:28,699 --> 01:07:34,079
Do not you understand how difficult it
is for a father to say so about his son?

482
01:07:34,163 --> 01:07:40,669
Do you know what? Stick from here, for the fan.
You are like all other bleak freaks.

483
01:07:40,753 --> 01:07:44,840
You have no idea
what you are dealing with.

484
01:07:53,140 --> 01:07:57,770
Hello. Sorry darling. I miss you.

485
01:07:57,853 --> 01:08:01,273
Wait, I do not hear. I will turn off.

486
01:08:01,356 --> 01:08:05,444
Where are you? With your parents?

487
01:08:05,527 --> 01:08:10,616
- No, with us. I missed you.
- I'm on my way home now.

488
01:08:10,699 --> 01:08:15,871
- How long are you leaving? We cook dinner.
- Oh, who's there?

489
01:08:15,996 --> 01:08:20,501
- Ian. We drove home from town.
- He should not be home with us.

490
01:08:20,584 --> 01:08:26,131
Have you never used a knife before?
Vegetables do not cut themselves.

491
01:08:26,215 --> 01:08:30,886
- Lauren, I mean seriously. Listen.
- Do you listen to my private conversation?

492
01:08:31,011 --> 01:08:37,559
- Lauren, enter another room now.
- Switch to music I do not get headache.

493
01:08:37,643 --> 01:08:43,315
- We wait for the food until you arrive.
- No, Lauren! Lauren!

494
01:08:51,448 --> 01:08:54,618
Come on. Come on!

495
01:09:06,547 --> 01:09:07,714
Run!

496
01:09:10,509 --> 01:09:15,472
Lauren? Lauren.
Did not you hear me calling?

497
01:09:15,556 --> 01:09:19,268
- Hi, myself.
- What the hell are you doing?

498
01:09:19,351 --> 01:09:23,689
- Sorry, we only ate dinner.
- Take it easy.

499
01:09:23,772 --> 01:09:28,902
- Ian, leave my home now. Now.
- No danger. Okay.

500
01:09:31,447 --> 01:09:34,032
Thanks for the good dinner.

501
01:09:41,540 --> 01:09:46,587
- Why are you appealing to him?
- You know nothing about him.

502
01:09:49,506 --> 01:09:55,345
Danny. Did we agree
that you would not come home to me anymore?

503
01:09:55,429 --> 01:10:00,309
Have you seen the news?
An old man has been murdered in Danbury.

504
01:10:00,392 --> 01:10:04,521
There were two kids who did.

505
01:10:04,646 --> 01:10:09,109
- Everything will happen again, right?
- Have you talked to your father?

506
01:10:09,193 --> 01:10:15,240
Why would I do it?
Have you done it?

507
01:10:15,324 --> 01:10:20,079
Fan, they will bura me again.
They will blow me again.

508
01:10:28,378 --> 01:10:31,381
You have no idea who the guy is.

509
01:10:31,465 --> 01:10:36,512
And you do that? He is not a
mental diagnosis, he is a child.

510
01:10:36,595 --> 01:10:41,558
Stay away from him.
Trust me, okay?

511
01:10:41,642 --> 01:10:46,396
- Stay away.
- Okay. Certainly.

512
01:10:48,148 --> 01:10:51,777
I have to quit this.

513
01:11:52,087 --> 01:11:55,716
Doctor Seymour, can we talk to you?

514
01:11:55,799 --> 01:11:59,720
We want to talk about the Danbury youths.

515
01:11:59,803 --> 01:12:03,849
They are not my clients.
I'm not involved in the case.

516
01:12:03,932 --> 01:12:09,062
No, but they have released Daniel Miller, who
killed Elisabeth Parks twelve years ago.

517
01:12:09,146 --> 01:12:13,442
- He was patient.
- I do not comment on clients.

518
01:12:17,237 --> 01:12:23,827
Some had traveled to North Fork
for rafting in fashion.

519
01:12:23,911 --> 01:12:28,916
What do I do in North Fork,
where is the salmon wandering?

520
01:12:28,999 --> 01:12:33,087
Remember where we were,
then we will continue.

521
01:12:34,963 --> 01:12:40,594
Did you tell your journalist
that he was out? Did you do that?

522
01:12:40,677 --> 01:12:44,264
She already knew. I just confirmed that.

523
01:12:44,348 --> 01:12:49,853
His father tells to anyone who
wants to listen. Empty. Tommy.

524
01:12:49,937 --> 01:12:53,107
Did you think that's the end of our part?

525
01:12:53,232 --> 01:12:59,321
Just because we locked him in
he will not be left behind lock and boom.

526
01:12:59,405 --> 01:13:03,283
I will return to my meeting.

527
01:13:03,367 --> 01:13:06,495
If you want to take a glass together

528
01:13:11,041 --> 01:13:16,839
- And forget that we were
indented in this shit, call me-

529
01:13:16,922 --> 01:13:21,969
- but calm down you She is running
her story tonight or tomorrow.

530
01:13:22,052 --> 01:13:27,307
Then it's over.
What we can count on are people.

531
01:13:27,391 --> 01:13:30,978
And people's lack of ability to follow
up things and long-term memories.

532
01:13:46,076 --> 01:13:50,414
Calm down, hell.

533
01:13:50,497 --> 01:13:55,544
Danny. You, me and Angela
need to be seen and set up a plan.

534
01:13:55,627 --> 01:13:58,547
We can try to solve this together,
then call me.

535
01:14:08,056 --> 01:14:12,978
I'm taking time.

536
01:14:13,061 --> 01:14:15,481
I went to Lizzie
to feed the cats. The kittens.

537
01:14:15,564 --> 01:14:20,486
Mom was home
and dad was back in the war.

538
01:14:20,569 --> 01:14:25,908
- Are you tired, Danny?
- No. I liked Lizzie.

539
01:14:25,991 --> 01:14:32,623
She did not look so good.
She had stared in her eyes.

540
01:14:32,706 --> 01:14:37,544
When I got there she was not there,
so I went upstairs.

541
01:14:37,628 --> 01:14:42,007
She had pillows. Dampuder.

542
01:14:42,091 --> 01:14:47,679
- It smelled of flowers and was sticky.
- Then, then?

543
01:14:47,763 --> 01:14:52,935
Then I heard her.
She came in and walked up the stairs.

544
01:14:53,018 --> 01:14:57,564
I ran to get past her, but
she stood in the way and did not move.

545
01:14:57,689 --> 01:15:00,776
I kicked her down.

546
01:15:00,859 --> 01:15:07,574
She pushed and sounded so I took the paddle
from the chair. She had pads from Boston.

547
01:15:07,658 --> 01:15:12,913
I covered her face
to make her stop.

548
01:15:12,996 --> 01:15:16,750
She continued to kick and kick.

549
01:15:16,834 --> 01:15:20,003
And how did it feel?

550
01:15:20,087 --> 01:15:25,592
Like a chicken with a cut head.

551
01:15:27,678 --> 01:15:33,308
- Why did you go back?
- I do not know.

552
01:15:35,686 --> 01:15:40,566
- Why, if you knew it was wrong?
- I do not know.

553
01:15:40,649 --> 01:15:46,155
- Your fingers were clean, the nails with.
- I do not know who that kid is.

554
01:15:46,238 --> 01:15:51,869
- No danger. Tell me what happened.
- It does not play a damn role!

555
01:15:53,078 --> 01:15:57,666
- You still do not believe me.
- No one believes you do not take responsibility.

556
01:15:57,750 --> 01:16:00,210
Your responsibility, then?

557
01:16:02,045 --> 01:16:06,175
Sorry, I took it.

558
01:16:06,258 --> 01:16:10,137
It was wrong. She is very weird.

559
01:16:10,220 --> 01:16:16,518
Return these to my father.
I do not want them anymore.

560
01:16:16,602 --> 01:16:20,981
Danny, for your own sake
you must call Angela.

561
01:16:24,860 --> 01:16:27,821
Danny!

562
01:16:33,202 --> 01:16:38,207
Please, I found him in my office.
He just went.

563
01:16:38,290 --> 01:16:43,170
- Why did not you keep him?
- He broke in. He has stolen from me.

564
01:16:43,253 --> 01:16:47,424
He is not my case or my patient!

565
01:16:48,801 --> 01:16:55,140
We do not know where Daniel Miller was
deployed, but we have talked to his father.

566
01:16:55,224 --> 01:16:57,768
I do not understand why he was released.

567
01:16:57,851 --> 01:17:03,398
Last I heard something where he was somewhere
in Connecticut, probably New London.

568
01:17:03,524 --> 01:17:09,196
The release of juvenile criminals is on the
tape after the recent violent violations.

569
01:17:09,279 --> 01:17:15,035
- I'm going to bed.
- Okay. I'll be right away.

570
01:17:16,120 --> 01:17:20,874
- Is it okay with you?
- Yes. And with you?

571
01:17:22,876 --> 01:17:26,171
I do not know.

572
01:17:26,255 --> 01:17:30,300
I do not know if it's okay.

573
01:17:32,052 --> 01:17:38,016
- Why did not you tell me he was?
- Because it was over 12 years ago, Lauren.

574
01:17:38,100 --> 01:17:42,479
I did not want
that would affect you or us.

575
01:17:42,604 --> 01:17:46,066
The kid needs your help.

576
01:17:46,150 --> 01:17:49,862
I do not know if I can help him.

577
01:17:51,155 --> 01:17:55,534
- Sorry?
- They locked him in.

578
01:17:55,617 --> 01:17:59,621
Because I thought
that he was a bad person.

579
01:17:59,705 --> 01:18:05,711
- Still believe it?
- I do not know anymore, that's the problem.

580
01:18:05,794 --> 01:18:11,425
- I just tried to protect you.
- No, you tried to protect yourself.

581
01:18:16,263 --> 01:18:19,016
Do you know what?

582
01:18:19,099 --> 01:18:23,228
Things are good or bad.

583
01:18:23,312 --> 01:18:27,483
With people it is not always as easy.

584
01:18:30,152 --> 01:18:35,115
I'm going back to town for a while.
You know where I am.

585
01:19:14,363 --> 01:19:18,742
Are you sure?
Do nothing until I get there.

586
01:19:18,826 --> 01:19:25,249
How far away are you? I go there
before he does anything against himself.

587
01:19:50,357 --> 01:19:53,318
Danny.

588
01:19:53,402 --> 01:19:57,823
Her niece lived here for a while,
I have heard.

589
01:20:02,286 --> 01:20:06,415
Danny, they're burying you for that gun.

590
01:20:08,459 --> 01:20:11,336
Maybe that.

591
01:20:11,420 --> 01:20:18,177
But that's crazy. I can not close
without seeing her face.

592
01:20:18,260 --> 01:20:23,932
Up and down, right there. She stares at me.
Not even if they burned down the place.

593
01:20:26,101 --> 01:20:31,315
- You can give me the weapon, Danny?
- No.

594
01:20:32,441 --> 01:20:37,154
I thought my dad would come here first.
Search and destroy.

595
01:20:37,237 --> 01:20:42,034
Mr. Miller. That was what he was good at.

596
01:20:42,117 --> 01:20:46,080
Little Danny Miller came back here evenly

597
01:20:50,334 --> 01:20:53,378
- Every time he did it
he thought...

598
01:20:53,462 --> 01:20:57,800
I thought-

599
01:20:57,883 --> 01:21:03,847
- Lizzie was going to walk around.

600
01:21:03,931 --> 01:21:08,727
Feed their cats.
"on my feet" mother had said.

601
01:21:08,852 --> 01:21:14,149
As if none of it had happened.
Neither Lizzie nor my mom.

602
01:21:14,233 --> 01:21:20,072
When I was a boy I pushed
and some friends a boy in the water-

603
01:21:20,155 --> 01:21:23,700
- And watched when he almost drowned.

604
01:21:23,826 --> 01:21:30,249
Did you see? Tom, that's your big problem.
You like to look at.

605
01:21:30,332 --> 01:21:34,211
You are a tourist. That's what the rich do.

606
01:21:34,294 --> 01:21:40,884
- Dad saved him from drowning.
- You jumped in and saved me.

607
01:21:40,968 --> 01:21:46,306
We could have gone together,
but you saved me, Dr. Seymour.

608
01:21:46,432 --> 01:21:50,686
Did I tell you about the drowning sooner?

609
01:21:50,811 --> 01:21:57,317
Did you know I was in the river?
I do not think so.

610
01:21:57,401 --> 01:22:01,613
You like to watch,
until you do not do it anymore.

611
01:22:01,697 --> 01:22:05,868
People I have no choice.
Why did not you help me?

612
01:22:05,951 --> 01:22:10,247
- I thought I did.
- Do not lie!

613
01:22:13,208 --> 01:22:19,131
Open it and pick it up.
Otherwise, I'll kill you and leave myself.

614
01:22:19,214 --> 01:22:24,011
- Do it! Now! Do it! Open it!
- Okay, I'll!

615
01:22:26,430 --> 01:22:30,434
Record it. Pick it up!

616
01:22:34,772 --> 01:22:37,608
Hold it.

617
01:22:42,321 --> 01:22:46,116
Danny, why are you doing this?

618
01:22:46,200 --> 01:22:48,285
Danny.

619
01:23:02,633 --> 01:23:06,804
Danny, do not do this.
Danny, does not.

620
01:23:11,350 --> 01:23:14,228
Snooze.

621
01:23:14,311 --> 01:23:19,858
- Blunda.
- Do not do it.

622
01:23:30,744 --> 01:23:36,625
That's where to feel.
It's not to be seen, it's feeling.

623
01:23:38,377 --> 01:23:44,007
Is that what you were afraid of?
The feeling that someone may like it?

624
01:23:44,091 --> 01:23:48,846
Why? Because we are killer?

625
01:23:48,929 --> 01:23:53,600
We're killer everyone, Tom.

626
01:23:53,684 --> 01:23:58,021
But to like it's something
completely different.

627
01:24:01,024 --> 01:24:05,654
- Did you like how it felt?
- No. No, I did not.

628
01:24:08,699 --> 01:24:11,702
Not me either.

629
01:24:13,245 --> 01:24:16,290
I kicked her.

630
01:24:16,373 --> 01:24:22,212
She fell and started shaking and...

631
01:24:22,296 --> 01:24:26,049
Forgive me.

632
01:24:43,901 --> 01:24:48,614
- Forgive me!
- No problem.

633
01:24:50,407 --> 01:24:52,493
So.

634
01:24:59,416 --> 01:25:03,378
It's daddy. He knows where I am, Tom.

635
01:25:06,799 --> 01:25:12,638
Okay. Everything will be okay.
Get upstairs and stay away.

636
01:25:23,774 --> 01:25:28,487
Away from the car!
I'm so tired of your fucking idiots!

637
01:25:28,570 --> 01:25:34,493
- Let him be!
- Who do you think was where he was?

638
01:25:34,576 --> 01:25:37,788
Should it be a sneak peek?

639
01:25:37,913 --> 01:25:40,791
Skitsnack?

640
01:25:55,639 --> 01:25:58,976
He can trick you, but not me.

641
01:28:09,356 --> 01:28:11,692
These are the stories.

642
01:28:11,775 --> 01:28:17,740
The stories the children intimate
themselves after the event or the action.

643
01:28:17,823 --> 01:28:21,285
We do not punish or accuse them-

644
01:28:21,368 --> 01:28:26,874
- Helps them to redo
their story in a way that gives them hope-

645
01:28:26,957 --> 01:28:31,211
Opportunities and a Future.

646
01:28:31,295 --> 01:28:37,217
If you do not think a child
has a future, what should you believe in?

647
01:28:51,982 --> 01:28:57,112
Excuse me, but do not you exploit
the children you try to help?

648
01:28:57,237 --> 01:29:01,784
The only thing he exploits here is himself.

649
01:29:01,867 --> 01:29:06,080
Worry is not for her.
She has had drugs.

650
01:29:06,205 --> 01:29:10,125
- That's what she's famous for here.
- Go to hell.

651
01:29:10,250 --> 01:29:13,921
- A good friend?
- I thought so.

652
01:29:14,004 --> 01:29:16,924
I saw the newspaper ad.

653
01:29:17,007 --> 01:29:21,386
This is really exciting, Tom.
But...

654
01:29:21,470 --> 01:29:25,891
- You did not mention me in the book.
- No, not in this.

655
01:29:25,974 --> 01:29:31,980
A chapter is not enough for you.
You deserve your own book.

656
01:29:33,524 --> 01:29:38,320
- Portland, then?
- Yes, I'm stopping. We are kind of a million.

657
01:29:38,404 --> 01:29:41,907
It's like prison, stuck with girls.

658
01:29:41,990 --> 01:29:48,622
- So you enjoy the present and the past?
- Yes. I'm looking forward.

659
01:29:48,705 --> 01:29:52,918
- Danny, there you are.
- Hello Darling.

660
01:29:54,795 --> 01:29:58,465
- Rowena.
- Yesvisst.

661
01:29:58,590 --> 01:30:03,762
You seem to feel good.
I moved here at the same time as Danny.

662
01:30:03,846 --> 01:30:08,058
Sorry, I missed the lecture.
- Did you tell me about your story?

663
01:30:08,142 --> 01:30:12,563
- No, he did not.
- He is very talented.

664
01:30:12,646 --> 01:30:17,484
It ends in the quarterly newspaper.
It is good and strange.

665
01:30:17,568 --> 01:30:22,656
It's about a boy who buy
toy soldiers made in China.

666
01:30:22,740 --> 01:30:25,409
Okay, now it's enough.

667
01:30:25,492 --> 01:30:29,747
- Hurry up, Rowe!
- See you soon.

668
01:30:31,373 --> 01:30:34,793
Nice to meet again.

669
01:30:36,920 --> 01:30:41,425
- Toy soldiers were from Walmart.
- Excuse me?

670
01:30:41,508 --> 01:30:46,305
In my story
comes the toys from Walmart.

671
01:30:46,388 --> 01:30:51,226
It's about a guy
who starts fucking with his psychiatrist.

672
01:30:51,351 --> 01:30:57,024
His former psychiatrist,
he had as a child.

673
01:30:57,107 --> 01:31:03,614
It's just a story, Tom.
I will send it to you. Read it.

674
01:31:03,697 --> 01:31:09,161
- What is the story called?
- "Tourist."

675
01:31:09,244 --> 01:31:14,166
But it's not you anymore, right?
No.

676
01:31:14,249 --> 01:31:19,046
You hugged the trigger, right?

677
01:31:19,129 --> 01:31:24,593
You almost killed him.
I thought you would do it.

678
01:31:27,554 --> 01:31:30,641
What is it?

679
01:31:30,724 --> 01:31:36,480
- What's so damn fun?
- Nothing. People like you, just.

680
01:31:37,898 --> 01:31:40,109
Forgive me.

681
01:31:40,192 --> 01:31:45,155
You, I have to go to the airport.

682
01:31:45,239 --> 01:31:50,869
- Do you want to go somewhere?
- Yes.

683
01:31:52,663 --> 01:31:58,043
How is Lauren?
Did she not join in the trip?

684
01:31:58,127 --> 01:32:01,505
No, she works.

685
01:32:01,630 --> 01:32:07,219
Is everything good between you?
She's gonna feed soon?

686
01:32:09,763 --> 01:32:14,268
- Yes, she will.
- Oh.

687
01:32:14,351 --> 01:32:20,649
What fun. I know you tried for a long time
and it was hard for her.

688
01:32:20,732 --> 01:32:26,905
- Congratulations. I'm so happy for you.
- How did you know my wife was pregnant?

689
01:32:29,199 --> 01:32:36,165
- I asked how you knew.
- Tom, she called me and we talked a little.

690
01:32:36,248 --> 01:32:39,585
Has not she told you?

691
01:32:41,253 --> 01:32:45,257
We have not spoken,
I saw it on Facebook.

692
01:32:45,382 --> 01:32:49,595
Relax, you're so excited.

693
01:32:49,678 --> 01:32:55,684
But it's a boy, huh? Did not
she just know that it's a son?

694
01:32:55,809 --> 01:33:00,481
You will be dad, Tom. Incredible.

695
01:33:01,690 --> 01:33:04,777
What are you going to baptize?

696
01:33:04,860 --> 01:33:09,656
You do not have to answer directly,
you have time for you.

697
01:33:09,740 --> 01:33:15,120
I have to say
I long for meeting him.

698
01:34:37,745 --> 01:34:43,584
