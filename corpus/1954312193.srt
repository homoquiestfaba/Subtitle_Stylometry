00:13:52,031 --> 00:13:54,332
I'm looking for the M8.

29
00:13:55,901 --> 00:13:58,169
Eh...

30
00:13:58,171 --> 00:14:01,873
Aye, you've gotta go
straight along
that way and...

31
00:14:02,908 --> 00:14:04,976
This is gonna be
pure hard to explain.

32
00:14:04,978 --> 00:14:07,445
- Do you know
where the Asda is?
- No.

33
00:14:07,447 --> 00:14:10,615
Yeah, I don't even know
what way you're pointin'.
What?

34
00:14:10,617 --> 00:14:13,218
- See, if you just drive
straight along up there...
- Yes?

35
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:15,920
And see the traffic lights
up there?

36
00:14:15,922 --> 00:14:17,488
Take a right.

37
00:14:17,490 --> 00:14:19,290
Then you'll go past
Ibrox Stadium, right?

38
00:14:19,292 --> 00:14:21,159
And go straight through
a roundabout.

39
00:14:21,161 --> 00:14:25,897
Then take a left.
So it's right, then just...

40
00:14:25,899 --> 00:14:27,498
And it's there.
The motorway is there.

41
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:29,100
It's back of Asda.
You'll see it.

42
00:14:29,102 --> 00:14:31,236
- Back of Asda, see?
- Okay.

43
00:14:31,238 --> 00:14:33,438
- Am I keeping you
from something?
- No.

44
00:14:34,607 --> 00:14:36,541
- Where are you going?
- Along here.

45
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:39,978
- For what? For work?
- No, I need to go
meet somebody.

46
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:41,579
- Oh, you're going
to meet someone.
- Aye.

47
00:14:41,581 --> 00:14:42,881
All right.
Thank you.
Sure.

48
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:16,214
I'm looking for a post office.

49
00:15:16,216 --> 00:15:18,249
Post office?
Yes.

50
00:15:18,251 --> 00:15:19,617
Where are you from?

51
00:15:19,619 --> 00:15:21,052
Where I am from?
Yeah.

52
00:15:21,054 --> 00:15:23,588
Albania.
Oh, are you?

53
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:25,156
You have
family here?
Yes.

54
00:15:25,158 --> 00:15:26,624
Oh, you do.

55
00:15:26,626 --> 00:15:29,627
That's the reason
I'm saying you have
to go another way...

56
00:15:29,629 --> 00:15:31,930
for another...

57
00:15:31,932 --> 00:15:33,932
It's after the shopping ce...

58
00:15:56,689 --> 00:15:59,123
Hi.
Lost?

59
00:15:59,125 --> 00:16:01,125
Yeah, lost.
What are you
looking for?

60
00:16:01,127 --> 00:16:03,528
I'm looking for the M8.
Up to the roundabout...

61
00:16:03,530 --> 00:16:05,496
Are you walking?
Yep.

62
00:16:05,498 --> 00:16:07,565
- Where are you walking to?
- Home.

63
00:16:07,567 --> 00:16:10,568
Oh, you're going home.
To your family?
No, no, just myself.

64
00:16:10,570 --> 00:16:12,704
Just yourself?
Aye. It's great.

65
00:16:12,706 --> 00:16:16,307
Yeah? How?
I can do whatever I like.

66
00:16:16,309 --> 00:16:18,743
So where are you
coming from?
Govan. Right there.

67
00:16:18,745 --> 00:16:20,478
Sorry?
Govan.

68
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:23,614
Govan?
Do you work there?
No, no.

69
00:16:23,616 --> 00:16:26,117
Don't work there.
I work for myself.

70
00:16:26,119 --> 00:16:29,487
Do you want a lift?
Eh... Aye, why not?

71
00:16:36,495 --> 00:16:39,130
You'll have to tell me
how to get there.

72
00:16:39,132 --> 00:16:41,566
Just follow this road
straight up.
Okay.

73
00:16:42,601 --> 00:16:44,402
Sure.

74
00:16:44,404 --> 00:16:46,671
So what do you do?
Electrician.

75
00:16:46,673 --> 00:16:48,006
Oh, you're an electrician.

76
00:16:49,675 --> 00:16:52,110
It's cold, right?

77
00:16:52,112 --> 00:16:54,612
Ah, it's a wee bit
nippy, aye.
Yeah.

78
00:16:56,281 --> 00:16:58,082
So what is it youse all doing?

79
00:16:58,084 --> 00:17:00,184
I'm...
I'm just, uh, driving...

80
00:17:00,186 --> 00:17:04,589
just, uh... some furniture
for my family and...

81
00:17:04,591 --> 00:17:07,191
Oh, right?
Yeah.

82
00:17:07,193 --> 00:17:08,693
So you live alone?

83
00:17:08,695 --> 00:17:10,461
Yes.
And you love it?

84
00:17:10,463 --> 00:17:13,698
Aye. It's great.
What do you love
about living alone?

85
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:16,601
- Nobody to nag you.
- Do I go straight through?

86
00:17:16,603 --> 00:17:19,537
Yeah, just straight through.
Straight through the whole way.

87
00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:56,340
It should be just
cart around that street
and stay in the right hand lane.

88
00:17:56,342 --> 00:17:58,609
What's that?
That's a tattoo
of my name.

89
00:17:58,611 --> 00:18:00,278
Of your name?
Yeah.

90
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:01,512
What's your name?
Andy.

91
00:18:01,514 --> 00:18:03,147
Andy. Hi.
Pleased to meet you.

92
00:18:03,149 --> 00:18:05,783
- Nice to meet you too.
- Thank you very much.

93
00:18:05,785 --> 00:18:08,119
Andy!

94
00:18:08,121 --> 00:18:09,320
- Want me?
- You coming?

95
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:17,762
The spot back here, you get...
you put your hand out.
Anybody can stop.

96
00:18:17,764 --> 00:18:20,565
There's lonely old guys.
Know what I mean?

97
00:18:20,567 --> 00:18:24,168
It was... Hey,
might as well check her out,
driving away in a big van.

98
00:18:24,170 --> 00:18:27,205
- Sure you can
drive this, huh? Huh?

99
00:18:30,742 --> 00:18:33,811
- No girlfriend? Really?
- Nah, I don't have
a girlfriend at all.

100
00:18:33,813 --> 00:18:36,247
You're very charming.

101
00:18:40,419 --> 00:18:41,786
That's better.

102
00:18:43,355 --> 00:18:45,389
Yeah? Sorted?

103
00:18:46,525 --> 00:18:48,626
You have a handsome face.
Aye?

104
00:18:48,628 --> 00:18:51,429
Yeah.
Thanks a lot. Cheers.

105
00:18:51,431 --> 00:18:53,865
- Do you think I'm pretty?
- I think you're gorgeous.

106
00:18:53,867 --> 00:18:55,833
- Do you?
- Aye, definitely.

107
00:18:56,435 --> 00:18:58,202
Good.

108
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:02,874
And a friendly smile as well.

109
00:19:02,876 --> 00:19:05,176
- Do I?
- Aye, right deep.

110
00:19:05,178 --> 00:19:07,311
- What about your smile?
- Aye.

111
00:19:07,313 --> 00:19:08,813
You've a nice smile yourself.

112
00:19:08,815 --> 00:19:11,215
- Cheers.
- Good.

113
00:19:11,217 --> 00:19:12,650
Good.

114
00:21:52,711 --> 00:21:54,545
No, no, no, lads! No!

115
00:22:50,702 --> 00:22:53,371
Mommy!
Whoo!

116
00:23:52,597 --> 00:23:54,465
I thought...

117
00:23:54,467 --> 00:23:56,100
you had your eye on my towel.

118
00:23:56,102 --> 00:23:58,502
No. I wanted
to speak to you.

119
00:23:58,504 --> 00:24:00,745
Do you know if there's
any good spots to surf
around here?

120
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:03,674
I'm not a surfer.

121
00:24:03,676 --> 00:24:05,609
Just living in
a little tent over there.

122
00:24:05,611 --> 00:24:08,512
Just hanging around.
Yeah?

123
00:24:08,514 --> 00:24:11,549
Reading, swimming.
You're not from here?
Where are you from?

124
00:24:13,185 --> 00:24:16,187
I'm from
Czech Republic.
Why are you in Scotland?

125
00:24:18,657 --> 00:24:20,991
I just... wanted to
get away from it all.

126
00:24:20,993 --> 00:24:23,227
Yeah?
Why here?

127
00:24:23,229 --> 00:24:25,229
Because it's...

128
00:24:25,231 --> 00:24:26,597
It's nowhere.

129
00:32:58,242 --> 00:33:01,278
Whoa!
Whoa, whoa. Excuse me.

130
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:03,613
Can I talk to you
before you run away,
darling?

131
00:33:03,615 --> 00:33:06,183
I wanted to speak
to you earlier, right,
but you disappeared.

132
00:33:06,185 --> 00:33:09,086
I thought you went
to the ladies' or somethin'.

133
00:33:09,088 --> 00:33:12,556
Anyway, right,
fuck all that shite.
Right?

134
00:33:12,558 --> 00:33:15,359
I really want
to buy you a drink, man.
You look absolutely stunning.

135
00:33:15,361 --> 00:33:17,160
And I...

136
00:33:17,162 --> 00:33:20,364
You know what?
I'm all alone.
You're all alone.

137
00:33:20,366 --> 00:33:22,566
What do you say?
What's one drink?

138
00:33:22,568 --> 00:33:24,334
What's one drink?

139
00:33:24,336 --> 00:33:27,104
I saw you on the road.
What, you saw <i>me</i>
<i>on the road?</i>

140
00:33:27,106 --> 00:33:29,740
Earlier, yeah.
Are you having
a laugh with me?

141
00:33:29,742 --> 00:33:32,242
You saw me? You wanna come
get a drink and a dance?

142
00:33:32,244 --> 00:33:35,045
Are you alone here?
Yeah, I'm all alone.
Right?

143
00:39:01,806 --> 00:39:05,775
The man from the car,
he buy the rose for you.

144
00:40:01,599 --> 00:40:04,401
A man's body has been found
washed up on a beach...

145
00:40:04,403 --> 00:40:05,535
near Arbroath.

146
00:40:05,537 --> 00:40:08,104
His wife and child
are reported missing.

147
00:40:08,106 --> 00:40:10,540
The police say the body
has been identified...

148
00:40:10,542 --> 00:40:13,576
as 36-year-old
Kenneth McClelland
from Edinburgh.

149
00:40:13,578 --> 00:40:15,779
The body was found
by a tourist...

150
00:40:15,781 --> 00:40:18,882
and is believed to have been
in the water for some time.

151
00:40:18,884 --> 00:40:23,686
Mr. McClelland was married and
worked as a chemistry lecturer
at Edinburgh University.

152
00:40:23,688 --> 00:40:27,457
The alarm was raised
when he failed to turn up
for work this morning.

153
00:40:27,459 --> 00:40:30,960
His car was found at
the nearby Deer Park Golf Club.

154
00:40:30,962 --> 00:40:34,531
His wife, 32-year-old
Alison McClelland,
and 18-month-old son...

155
00:40:34,533 --> 00:40:36,733
are believed
to have been with him.

156
00:40:36,735 --> 00:40:39,869
A police and coast guard
search operation
involving a helicopter...

157
00:40:39,871 --> 00:40:42,038
has been halted due to fog.

158
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:43,873
The next bulletin
is on the hour.

159
00:40:46,845 --> 00:40:48,646
Well, plenty to talk about,
as ever, with Kay.

160
00:40:48,647 --> 00:40:51,481
You can call now...
10-500-92-95-00.

161
00:40:51,483 --> 00:40:53,483
You can text as well...
80295.

162
00:40:53,485 --> 00:40:55,652
- It's 8:17.
- Good morning, Gary.

163
00:40:55,654 --> 00:40:58,521
Well, as we've heard,
for a whole host of reasons...

164
00:40:58,523 --> 00:41:00,857
2014 is a very important year
for Scotland.

165
00:41:00,859 --> 00:41:03,159
Of course, the referendum.
We're expecting that date today.

166
00:41:03,161 --> 00:41:06,229
But the Commonwealth Games
and Ryder Cup...

167
00:41:06,231 --> 00:41:08,598
You seem very excited
about that.
I am.

168
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:11,520
He's jumping out of his seat
at the prospect of the year
he's gonna have...

169
00:41:48,239 --> 00:41:51,708
<i>Fuckin' hell, you're gorgeous.</i>

170
00:41:53,911 --> 00:41:56,045
- You think so?
- It's your eyes.

171
00:41:57,248 --> 00:41:59,649
Somethin' about your eyes.

172
00:42:00,684 --> 00:42:03,186
Your eyes, your lips.

173
00:42:03,188 --> 00:42:05,255
That
black hair.
Yeah?

174
00:42:08,559 --> 00:42:10,193
You just look...

175
00:42:11,562 --> 00:42:13,129
amazing.

176
00:45:23,787 --> 00:45:25,421
Hey, you okay?

177
00:45:33,797 --> 00:45:36,766
Want a hand up?
Want a hand?

178
00:49:21,525 --> 00:49:24,193
Get out, eh? Get out!

179
00:51:05,595 --> 00:51:07,063
Excuse me.

180
00:51:08,432 --> 00:51:10,066
Excuse me.

181
00:51:10,068 --> 00:51:13,069
Uh, I'm a bit lost, really.

182
00:51:13,071 --> 00:51:15,137
Am I headed towards Taynuilt?

183
00:51:16,239 --> 00:51:17,339
Yeah.

184
00:51:17,341 --> 00:51:20,276
I am? Is it far?

185
00:51:20,278 --> 00:51:22,445
It's about 10 minutes away.

186
00:51:22,447 --> 00:51:24,613
Ten minutes? Are you...
Are you headed there?

187
00:51:25,615 --> 00:51:27,349
I'm going to the supermarket.

188
00:51:27,351 --> 00:51:29,251
Is it on the way?

189
00:51:32,556 --> 00:51:34,356
Yeah.

190
00:51:34,358 --> 00:51:36,425
I could drop you off
if you'd like.

191
00:51:42,299 --> 00:51:44,200
Yeah?

192
00:52:13,230 --> 00:52:15,664
Here. Let me
turn this up for you.

193
00:52:24,374 --> 00:52:26,242
That's better.

194
00:52:41,458 --> 00:52:43,192
You're very quiet.

195
00:52:49,232 --> 00:52:51,467
So why do you
shop at night then?

196
00:52:55,672 --> 00:52:57,406
People wind me up.

197
00:52:59,743 --> 00:53:00,809
How?

198
00:53:03,213 --> 00:53:04,914
They're ignorant.

199
00:53:08,618 --> 00:53:10,886
What about your friends?

200
00:53:14,257 --> 00:53:16,292
So you don't have any friends?

201
00:53:21,565 --> 00:53:22,665
No.

202
00:53:23,767 --> 00:53:25,401
How about a girlfriend?

203
00:53:31,708 --> 00:53:33,342
How old are you?

204
00:53:34,911 --> 00:53:36,478
I'm 26.

205
00:53:38,448 --> 00:53:41,250
When was the last time
you had a girlfriend?

206
00:53:43,720 --> 00:53:45,888
Never had one.

207
00:53:45,890 --> 00:53:47,623
So don't you get lonely then?

208
00:53:54,998 --> 00:53:56,732
You've very nice hands.

209
00:54:01,972 --> 00:54:03,772
You've beautiful hands.

210
00:54:25,829 --> 00:54:28,297
Do you want to look at me?

211
00:54:28,299 --> 00:54:30,566
This isn't Tesco's,
is it?
No.

212
00:54:36,840 --> 00:54:39,308
I noticed you
looking at me before.

213
00:54:44,914 --> 00:54:46,348
And?

214
00:54:47,917 --> 00:54:49,818
I liked it.

215
00:54:54,524 --> 00:54:56,759
You're uncomfortable.

216
00:54:56,761 --> 00:54:59,461
No. Just want
to go to Tesco's.

217
00:55:05,702 --> 00:55:08,337
So you never think
about it then?

218
00:55:10,907 --> 00:55:12,541
Think about what?

219
00:55:13,843 --> 00:55:15,978
Being with a girl.

220
00:55:22,352 --> 00:55:24,032
When was the last time
you touched someone?

221
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:38,801
Let me see your hands.

222
00:55:45,809 --> 00:55:47,376
Cold.

223
00:55:50,680 --> 00:55:52,348
I have to get back soon.

224
00:56:03,593 --> 00:56:05,461
How was that?

225
00:56:06,463 --> 00:56:07,663
Cold.

226
00:56:10,967 --> 00:56:13,535
Do you want to do it again?

227
00:56:13,537 --> 00:56:15,537
Yeah.

228
00:56:23,446 --> 00:56:25,681
Do you want to touch my neck?

229
00:56:25,683 --> 00:56:27,416
Here.

230
00:56:35,759 --> 00:56:37,960
How was that?

231
00:56:39,763 --> 00:56:41,497
Yeah.

232
00:56:42,999 --> 00:56:45,000
Your hands are very soft.

233
00:56:52,809 --> 00:56:55,544
I have a place
about 30 minutes away.

234
00:56:56,780 --> 00:56:59,081
Will you come with me there?

235
00:57:58,107 --> 00:57:59,875
Cold.

236
00:57:59,877 --> 00:58:02,077
I won't let that stop us.

237
00:58:21,965 --> 00:58:23,532
Come to me.

238
00:58:38,915 --> 00:58:40,749
Dreaming?

239
00:58:40,751 --> 00:58:42,150
Yes.

240
00:58:42,152 --> 00:58:43,886
Dreaming?

241
00:58:43,888 --> 00:58:45,621
Yes, we are.

242
01:09:44,947 --> 01:09:47,815
The bus will be
along in a minute.

243
01:10:43,772 --> 01:10:48,610
Do you not think you should be
wearing a jacket, little lass?
The weather's terrible up here.

244
01:10:48,612 --> 01:10:52,480
You'll catch your death of cold
if you've not got a jacket
or a hat or something on.

245
01:10:55,818 --> 01:10:58,386
You've not got the right
clothes on at all.

246
01:11:05,894 --> 01:11:07,695
You all right there?

247
01:11:09,965 --> 01:11:11,599
Eh?

248
01:11:12,668 --> 01:11:14,402
You okay?

249
01:11:19,708 --> 01:11:21,276
Can I do something for you?

250
01:11:21,278 --> 01:11:23,978
Chase yourself, dafty.

251
01:11:23,980 --> 01:11:26,981
Leave the lassie alone.
She doesn't want anything
to do with you.

252
01:11:35,691 --> 01:11:37,692
Do you need any help?

253
01:11:47,770 --> 01:11:49,037
Yes.

254
01:11:56,612 --> 01:11:58,379
Right.

255
01:13:51,660 --> 01:13:53,528
Let me just take your coat.

01:14:20,490 --> 01:14:22,156

257

01:14:38,708 --> 01:14:40,208
Stop!

262

You all right?

282
01:20:40,602 --> 01:20:43,137
If you're frightened, let's go.

283
01:20:49,411 --> 01:20:51,011
Come on.

284
01:20:52,280 --> 01:20:54,281
It's all right.

285
01:20:55,517 --> 01:20:57,251
That's it.

286
01:21:35,090 --> 01:21:36,924
It's okay.
It's okay.

01:21:49,271 --> 01:21:51,205

It's okay.

289
01:21:59,514 --> 01:22:01,415
All right.

290
01:22:04,686 --> 01:22:06,587
Okay.

291
01:22:06,589 --> 01:22:08,522
You did it.

292
01:22:08,524 --> 01:22:10,257
You did it.

293
01:26:23,378 --> 01:26:24,578
You all right?

294
01:28:31,572 --> 01:28:34,741
You just off for a ramble
in the woods then? Eh?

295
01:28:34,743 --> 01:28:37,778
Huh?
You just off for a ramble
in the woods? Yeah, yeah?

296
01:28:37,780 --> 01:28:41,014
Oh, it's, uh...
Watch how you step here.
It's a bit, uh...

297
01:28:41,016 --> 01:28:44,451
It's a bit slippery
round here, but...
this time of year.

298
01:28:44,453 --> 01:28:48,622
It's all right in summer.
Well, it's still wet in summer,
but not as bad as it is now.

299
01:28:48,624 --> 01:28:50,924
But there's plenty
of trails around here.

300
01:28:50,926 --> 01:28:52,859
Have you been here before?

301
01:28:52,861 --> 01:28:54,594
No? First time? Yeah?

302
01:28:54,596 --> 01:28:56,963
Oh, you won't get lost.
They're all clearly marked.

303
01:28:56,965 --> 01:29:00,434
But, uh, there's about
2,000 acres of forest here,

304
01:29:00,436 --> 01:29:04,371
so you shouldn't...
you should have, uh, plenty
of places to go in there.

305
01:29:04,373 --> 01:29:06,106
You on your own?
Yeah.

306
01:29:06,108 --> 01:29:10,877
Yeah, on your own?
Oh, well, it's a nice place
if you want some solitude,

307
01:29:10,879 --> 01:29:14,715
you know,
to "gather your thoughts"
and all that, yeah?

308
01:29:14,717 --> 01:29:17,417
So, uh, enjoy yourself
anyway, okay?
Thank you.
