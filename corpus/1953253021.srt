1
00:03:24,746 --> 00:03:27,456
When a is less than zero
and b is greater than one

2
00:03:27,498 --> 00:03:30,250
y equals ab to the x power.

3
00:03:30,293 --> 00:03:32,836
This models negative exponential growth...

4
00:04:09,082 --> 00:04:11,708
Maggy.

5
00:04:11,751 --> 00:04:14,628
- Maggy!
- Maggy.

6
00:04:14,671 --> 00:04:17,005
Maggy.

7
00:04:20,718 --> 00:04:25,180
Imagine two transformations
take place at the same point,

8
00:04:25,223 --> 00:04:27,933
a translation and a reflection...

9
00:04:29,852 --> 00:04:33,939
Your daughter's performance has decreased
in the last few weeks.

10
00:04:33,982 --> 00:04:36,858
We're concerned about her lack of focus.

11
00:04:36,901 --> 00:04:40,279
This is the third time
she's fallen asleep in class.

12
00:04:42,782 --> 00:04:44,741
You know, Maggy, you're
selfish and unreliable.

13
00:04:44,784 --> 00:04:47,452
You're just like your father.
All you ever do is complain!

14
00:04:47,495 --> 00:04:49,079
That's the only thing
you ever say, Mom.

15
00:04:49,122 --> 00:04:52,374
You only see the bad in me.

16
00:04:52,417 --> 00:04:53,583
Listen to me.

17
00:04:53,626 --> 00:04:55,794
If your grades don't improve,
and I mean immediately,

18
00:04:55,837 --> 00:04:56,795
you can forget about the band.

19
00:04:56,838 --> 00:04:57,879
Do you hear me?

20
00:04:57,922 --> 00:04:58,964
You can't do that, Mom.

21
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:02,467
That's the only thing I have,
the only thing I'm good at!

22
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:05,178
You have a choice to make, Maggy.

23
00:05:05,221 --> 00:05:08,432
And I mean it.

24
00:05:14,897 --> 00:05:15,897
Hi, Maggy.

25
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:17,399
Hey big fella, how are you?

26
00:05:17,442 --> 00:05:19,151
Good.
Are you sad?

27
00:05:19,193 --> 00:05:22,195
No, no. I'm actually really happy
to see you, Michael.

28
00:05:22,238 --> 00:05:25,782
I got a few new ones.
Wanna play?

29
00:05:25,825 --> 00:05:28,201
Sure, what you got?

30
00:05:36,044 --> 00:05:38,045
Turn it down!

31
00:05:53,186 --> 00:05:57,773
# Bring down the house,
you lost me in shadow #

32
00:05:57,815 --> 00:06:02,194
# We're breathing it now,
run from the day glow... #

33
00:06:29,972 --> 00:06:31,973
Alright, I'm done for today.

34
00:06:32,016 --> 00:06:35,394
Come on, let's play one more song.
We only have a week left.

35
00:06:35,436 --> 00:06:36,770
I don't think we're ready
to do this show.

36
00:06:36,813 --> 00:06:39,523
We have to start playing a real venue
at some point.

37
00:06:39,565 --> 00:06:42,317
Yeah, but let's play
at a couple more parties first.

38
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,568
Might be less embarrassing.

39
00:06:43,611 --> 00:06:46,738
What do you mean by embarrassing?
We're not that bad.

40
00:06:46,781 --> 00:06:48,615
- Come on, Maggy.
- What?

41
00:06:48,658 --> 00:06:51,576
I think we all know why
you are in the band.

42
00:06:53,704 --> 00:06:56,623
I'd better get going, too.

43
00:07:02,171 --> 00:07:05,549
What is his problem?

44
00:07:05,591 --> 00:07:08,927
He's just jealous.
He'll get over it.

45
00:07:25,153 --> 00:07:27,737
Is it true what Pete says?

46
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:28,905
What?

47
00:07:28,948 --> 00:07:32,492
That I'm only in the band
because of you?

48
00:07:32,535 --> 00:07:34,870
He didn't say that.

49
00:07:34,912 --> 00:07:38,623
He doesn't like me and he doesn't think
that I can sing.

50
00:07:38,666 --> 00:07:42,419
Maggy, just let it go.
You have a great voice.

51
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:46,256
Our music is just kind of different,
you know?

52
00:07:55,516 --> 00:07:57,142
Why aren't you up yet?

53
00:07:57,185 --> 00:07:59,519
School starts in ten minutes.
Get up.

54
00:08:02,315 --> 00:08:04,274
I can be ready in five minutes.

55
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:08,403
When will you learn to be
responsible, Maggy?

56
00:08:08,446 --> 00:08:11,364
I forgot to set the alarm.
It's not a crime.

57
00:08:13,534 --> 00:08:17,996
I hate math.
My mom's going to hate me.

58
00:08:18,039 --> 00:08:19,706
That's the second test
I've flunked this year.

59
00:08:19,749 --> 00:08:22,209
If you'd just listen to me,
you wouldn't have this problem.

60
00:08:22,251 --> 00:08:24,628
My mom would kill me
if I got caught cheating.

61
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:25,712
Why would you get caught?

62
00:08:25,755 --> 00:08:28,673
She wants you to get
better grades, right?

63
00:08:28,716 --> 00:08:31,468
Oh hey, this will cheer you up.

64
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:34,054
Tickets are 20 bucks,
but it's totally worth it.

65
00:08:34,096 --> 00:08:35,180
You have to come.

66
00:08:35,223 --> 00:08:35,764
You can bring Jay if you want.

67
00:08:35,806 --> 00:08:39,392
I know the guitarist, so we can go backstage
and hang out with the band.

68
00:08:39,435 --> 00:08:41,603
I bet they'll have great advice for you.

69
00:08:41,646 --> 00:08:42,604
That'd be so cool.

70
00:08:42,647 --> 00:08:47,150
Fred said they're about to sign with
a major label and go on a national tour.

71
00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:49,194
You should really get to know them.

72
00:08:49,237 --> 00:08:51,530
Yeah, thank you, Kimmy.
You're the best.

73
00:08:51,572 --> 00:08:53,782
What are friends for?
See you tomorrow.

74
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:51,381
"My dearest Maggy, I hope this letter
finds you in good health.

75
00:09:51,424 --> 00:09:55,135
I've wanted to write you for a long time.

76
00:09:55,177 --> 00:09:59,306
I'm old now, and I wonder what has
happened to you over the years.

77
00:09:59,348 --> 00:10:04,394
I hope you appreciate your life
and the source from which it springs.

78
00:10:04,437 --> 00:10:08,231
Always remember that you
are beautiful and gracious

79
00:10:08,274 --> 00:10:12,360
and that you are here for a unique purpose.

80
00:10:12,403 --> 00:10:14,696
I know life can be difficult.

81
00:10:14,739 --> 00:10:17,949
It is easy to lose sight of the things
that really matter.

82
00:10:17,992 --> 00:10:23,413
But I trust that deep inside,
you know what is precious in your life.

83
00:10:23,456 --> 00:10:29,711
Remember to do at least one thing every day
that gives purpose to your existence...

84
00:10:33,966 --> 00:10:38,053
"Look around for the hidden messages
of beauty and truth.

85
00:10:38,095 --> 00:10:44,476
You can find them in every tree,
every flower, every human being.

86
00:10:44,518 --> 00:10:46,186
We are all connected,

87
00:10:46,228 --> 00:10:52,651
and long for each other's encouragement,
understanding, and love.

88
00:10:52,693 --> 00:10:55,236
"I hope you know
that you are deeply loved.

89
00:10:55,279 --> 00:11:02,452
There are many who look up to you and find
in you an example that inspires and uplifts."

90
00:11:02,495 --> 00:11:05,372
What do you say to that?

91
00:11:05,414 --> 00:11:09,501
I know. Who writes like this?

92
00:11:09,543 --> 00:11:13,797
No, it can't be someone from our school.

93
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:18,426
It's definitely an old person's handwriting.

94
00:11:18,469 --> 00:11:21,554
It's signed by someone named Sam.

95
00:11:21,597 --> 00:11:25,308
Oh, my mom just got home.
Gotta go, bye.

96
00:11:27,561 --> 00:11:30,063
"Thank you for being such
a good person.

97
00:11:30,106 --> 00:11:33,692
Ever since you were little,
you were off to great things.

98
00:11:33,734 --> 00:11:37,195
Your parents always knew you had
a special spirit about you.

99
00:11:37,238 --> 00:11:41,533
You have the gift of making other people
feel good about themselves,

100
00:11:41,575 --> 00:11:46,579
of being kind and thoughtful.

101
00:11:46,622 --> 00:11:50,500
May the Lord bless you always,
your friend Sam."

102
00:11:50,543 --> 00:11:54,546
There's no address, but it says here
his last name is Worthington.

103
00:11:54,588 --> 00:11:56,548
Sam Worthington.

104
00:11:56,590 --> 00:11:58,967
Sam Worthington?

105
00:11:59,009 --> 00:12:01,553
I have no idea who that is, Maggy.

106
00:12:01,595 --> 00:12:04,556
But you must know him, Mom, please?

107
00:12:04,598 --> 00:12:08,393
He must be a relative or an old friend?

108
00:12:08,436 --> 00:12:13,982
If anything, I guess this could be
a distant cousin,

109
00:12:14,024 --> 00:12:17,277
or maybe somebody from
your dad's family.

110
00:12:17,319 --> 00:12:18,987
I wish I could help you, honey,

111
00:12:19,029 --> 00:12:22,532
I just, I honestly don't recall
anyone with that name.

112
00:12:22,575 --> 00:12:24,993
I have to go.

113
00:12:25,035 --> 00:12:27,370
See you later.

114
00:12:52,062 --> 00:12:54,230
Maybe it's a prank.

115
00:12:54,273 --> 00:12:55,607
A prank?

116
00:12:55,649 --> 00:12:59,486
But it's totally sweet,
like, from the heart.

117
00:12:59,528 --> 00:13:01,863
Like I'm the greatest person
in the world.

118
00:13:01,906 --> 00:13:04,240
That is weird.

119
00:13:04,283 --> 00:13:05,950
Maybe it's a sweet prank.

120
00:13:05,993 --> 00:13:07,827
Who would even do that?

121
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:09,621
Hey, you guys made it.

122
00:13:09,663 --> 00:13:12,373
Come with me.

123
00:13:19,632 --> 00:13:21,841
- Hey, Fred.
- Hey.

124
00:13:21,884 --> 00:13:25,386
So, this is Maggy and Jay
from the new band The Threshold

125
00:13:25,429 --> 00:13:26,471
I've been telling you about.

126
00:13:26,514 --> 00:13:28,348
Hi, thanks for coming out
to the show tonight.

127
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:30,600
Yeah, we're really excited
to see you guys.

128
00:13:30,643 --> 00:13:32,769
We've heard a lot of good things
about you.

129
00:13:32,812 --> 00:13:34,896
Yeah, very excited.
You guys are great.

130
00:13:34,939 --> 00:13:37,649
Thanks. We're excited to play.

131
00:13:40,694 --> 00:13:42,987
- Hey, I've got a question for you.
- Sure.

132
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:45,448
What would they have to do
to be your opening act

133
00:13:45,491 --> 00:13:47,867
or play in a venue like this?

134
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:52,080
Uh, well, you could record a demo,
just a few songs.

135
00:13:52,122 --> 00:13:56,626
Play some parties, some small shows,
and just work your way up.

136
00:13:56,669 --> 00:13:58,294
Yeah, they are really good.

137
00:13:58,337 --> 00:14:00,755
- Jay's awesome on the guitar.
- Oh yeah?

138
00:14:00,798 --> 00:14:04,217
You should hear his sound.
Play something, Jay.

139
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:06,052
- It's okay.
- Come on.

140
00:14:06,095 --> 00:14:10,014
Here, you can use this.
We're not on for another half hour.

141
00:14:18,732 --> 00:14:20,900
What do you play, Maggy?

142
00:14:20,943 --> 00:14:25,530
- Nothing, I'm...
- She has a fantastic voice.

143
00:14:25,573 --> 00:14:27,448
You should hear her.

144
00:14:30,119 --> 00:14:32,787
Sing, Maggy.

145
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:35,915
No, it's okay.

146
00:15:08,365 --> 00:15:11,993
Mom?

147
00:16:06,382 --> 00:16:07,173
How'd you do?

148
00:16:07,216 --> 00:16:09,300
Well enough.
You could have, too.

149
00:16:09,343 --> 00:16:11,302
I don't know why I'm such a loser.

150
00:16:11,345 --> 00:16:15,264
Hey, remember, "You are an example
that inspires and uplifts."

151
00:16:15,307 --> 00:16:17,892
I still have no idea who wrote that letter.

152
00:16:20,187 --> 00:16:21,938
I might go visit my dad today.

153
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:23,856
I thought you were done with him.

154
00:16:23,899 --> 00:16:28,486
I am, kind of, but he might know
who this Sam is.

155
00:16:28,529 --> 00:16:30,405
Good luck with that.

156
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:44,502
Maggy?

157
00:16:44,545 --> 00:16:48,423
Hi. Is my dad home?

158
00:16:48,465 --> 00:16:51,467
Yes, come on in.

159
00:17:05,607 --> 00:17:07,734
You've grown.

160
00:17:13,574 --> 00:17:16,242
How's your mom?

161
00:17:16,285 --> 00:17:20,246
Okay. She worries a lot.

162
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:26,210
How's school?
Or, are you finished already?

163
00:17:28,088 --> 00:17:30,715
School's okay.

164
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:41,893
Listen, Dad, I got this letter
in the mail the other day,

165
00:17:41,935 --> 00:17:44,604
and it's from someone named
Sam Worthington.

166
00:17:44,646 --> 00:17:46,939
Do you know who that is?

167
00:17:46,982 --> 00:17:49,442
Sam Worthington?

168
00:17:49,485 --> 00:17:52,528
No, I've never heard of him.

169
00:17:52,571 --> 00:17:54,530
Are you sure?

170
00:17:58,077 --> 00:18:00,453
Looks like an old person's writing.

171
00:18:00,496 --> 00:18:02,455
Yeah, that's what I thought.

172
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:09,921
Sorry I couldn't be of more help.

173
00:18:12,049 --> 00:18:14,801
It's all right.

174
00:18:14,843 --> 00:18:19,347
You should come visit more often.

175
00:18:30,692 --> 00:18:33,945
"You might sometimes feel
alone in this world.

176
00:18:33,987 --> 00:18:35,613
You are not.

177
00:18:35,656 --> 00:18:38,783
Someone is watching over you
and blessing your life

178
00:18:38,826 --> 00:18:43,079
even though at times it may not
seem like it.

179
00:18:43,122 --> 00:18:48,167
Your happiness is the reward of
the happiness you endow to others.

180
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:53,047
I assure you, that if you give of yourself,
you will receive in return

181
00:18:53,090 --> 00:18:57,677
the blessings of a life
full of purpose and joy."

182
00:19:09,022 --> 00:19:11,607
Here. Hope you can come.

183
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:14,402
Hey, you guys should come.
It's going to be good.

184
00:19:14,444 --> 00:19:16,946
From what I've heard,
you can't even sing.

185
00:19:16,989 --> 00:19:19,365
Yeah, well, what do you know?

186
00:19:19,408 --> 00:19:22,118
You're just jealous you're
obviously not in a band.

187
00:19:34,298 --> 00:19:36,215
Thank you.

188
00:19:39,011 --> 00:19:40,928
Hi.

189
00:19:42,639 --> 00:19:45,975
If this letter was stamped here, it must have
been dropped off here, right?

190
00:19:46,018 --> 00:19:47,435
That's right.

191
00:19:47,477 --> 00:19:51,898
Can I please ask you something?
It's really important.

192
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:56,027
"I hope you keep up your cheerful spirit,
and I trust that you are well.

193
00:19:56,069 --> 00:19:59,655
For now, I send you a deep feeling
of gratitude and joy."

194
00:19:59,698 --> 00:20:02,658
That's quite the letter.

195
00:20:02,701 --> 00:20:05,203
You sure you don't know
who wrote that letter?

196
00:20:05,245 --> 00:20:08,289
It sounds like someone
who knows you really well.

197
00:20:08,332 --> 00:20:10,541
That's the weird thing.

198
00:20:12,628 --> 00:20:16,130
- Nothing.
- Hey, Bob.

199
00:20:18,759 --> 00:20:21,552
Ah yes, I think I know
who wrote this letter.

200
00:20:21,595 --> 00:20:22,345
Really?

201
00:20:22,387 --> 00:20:23,638
Yeah, I'm not sure who exactly,

202
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:26,557
but definitely someone
at the Maple Hill Rest Home.

203
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:29,977
I pick one of these up every day.

204
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:33,522
Ah, here you go.

205
00:20:55,295 --> 00:21:00,049
Hi, I'm looking for someone by the name
of Sam Worthington.

206
00:21:02,594 --> 00:21:05,680
I don't think we have
anyone by that name.

207
00:21:05,722 --> 00:21:08,349
Can you check?

208
00:21:17,901 --> 00:21:20,152
No, sorry.

209
00:21:20,195 --> 00:21:23,906
But that's impossible.
He has to live here.

210
00:21:53,478 --> 00:21:56,439
Are you Sam Worthington?

211
00:21:56,481 --> 00:21:58,441
Who wants to know?

212
00:22:00,819 --> 00:22:02,570
I think you wrote me a letter.

213
00:22:02,612 --> 00:22:05,406
What makes you think
I wrote you a letter?

214
00:22:05,449 --> 00:22:06,949
Your mailman told me.

215
00:22:06,992 --> 00:22:09,827
Impossible, there are privacy laws.

216
00:22:09,870 --> 00:22:13,789
- You could sue him.
- I might.

217
00:22:13,832 --> 00:22:16,542
So, you wrote this letter?

218
00:22:19,755 --> 00:22:23,549
You are asking me some very personal
questions, young lady.

219
00:22:23,592 --> 00:22:28,054
You wrote me a very personal letter,
Sam Worthington.

220
00:22:31,391 --> 00:22:34,602
So, you pick names from the phone book?

221
00:22:34,644 --> 00:22:38,439
- Maybe.
- But I'm not listed.

222
00:22:38,482 --> 00:22:42,234
- Can't be.
- I'm not.

223
00:22:51,536 --> 00:22:54,622
Nancy is my mother's name,
and that's my address,

224
00:22:54,664 --> 00:22:57,208
but I don't know who
this Maggy Fuller is.

225
00:22:57,250 --> 00:23:01,420
You must have accidentally skipped down
a name when you wrote the address.

226
00:23:01,463 --> 00:23:04,507
Well, isn't that something?

227
00:23:04,549 --> 00:23:08,010
Sam Worthington is my pen name.

228
00:23:08,053 --> 00:23:11,514
Your pen name to write letters
to people you don't know?

229
00:23:11,556 --> 00:23:13,432
Yes, that's right.

230
00:23:13,475 --> 00:23:15,434
Look at me, I'm old.

231
00:23:15,477 --> 00:23:17,603
I don't get out much anymore.

232
00:23:17,646 --> 00:23:19,105
I gotta do something.

233
00:23:19,147 --> 00:23:21,816
Yeah, but why letters to people
you don't know?

234
00:23:21,858 --> 00:23:23,818
It's what I'm good at.

235
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:25,986
Didn't you like your letter?

236
00:23:26,029 --> 00:23:29,573
Yeah, sure, but it drove me crazy
not knowing who wrote it.

237
00:23:29,616 --> 00:23:31,826
Does it make any difference
who wrote it?

238
00:23:31,868 --> 00:23:34,578
I thought the letter was
from an old relative.

239
00:23:34,621 --> 00:23:36,831
You know, someone who knows
my parents.

240
00:23:36,873 --> 00:23:38,707
Well, see, isn't that enough?

241
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:43,170
Why did you have to go snooping around
and find me?

242
00:23:43,213 --> 00:23:45,172
I don't know.

243
00:23:45,215 --> 00:23:50,469
You're the one person who had
something nice to say about me.

244
00:23:50,512 --> 00:23:52,596
And now it doesn't even
mean anything.

245
00:23:52,639 --> 00:23:55,057
Don't say it doesn't mean anything.

246
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:57,476
Every word is from the bottom
of my heart.

247
00:23:57,519 --> 00:23:58,978
But you don't even know me.

248
00:23:59,020 --> 00:24:04,024
Young lady, if I'm the one person who has
something nice to say about you,

249
00:24:04,067 --> 00:24:07,361
I know you better than anyone else.

250
00:24:15,203 --> 00:24:18,914
- Michael, you're still up.
- Can't sleep.

251
00:24:24,796 --> 00:24:28,174
- Wanna read me a story?
- Sure.

252
00:24:32,095 --> 00:24:35,639
"November's white flaked snow soon
became beautiful accents

253
00:24:35,682 --> 00:24:38,726
to December's Christmas greens and reds.

254
00:24:38,768 --> 00:24:40,686
Everywhere the iron gate children walked,

255
00:24:40,729 --> 00:24:43,898
they saw the signs that Christmas
would soon come...

256
00:25:18,558 --> 00:25:21,810
I know this recording place that gives
special deals to up and coming bands.

257
00:25:21,853 --> 00:25:24,772
For only 200 bucks, you can record 3 songs.

258
00:25:24,814 --> 00:25:26,649
Which is perfect for a demo.

259
00:25:26,691 --> 00:25:29,401
And we need a good demo,
if we want more gigs.

260
00:25:29,444 --> 00:25:31,904
Yeah, they're usually
booked for months,

261
00:25:31,947 --> 00:25:33,989
but they do have an opening
tomorrow afternoon.

262
00:25:34,032 --> 00:25:37,826
You have to pay in advance,
but you get your CD mixed right away.

263
00:25:37,869 --> 00:25:40,913
That's awesome, Kimmy.
You should totally be our manager.

264
00:25:40,956 --> 00:25:42,456
I know, it's kind of fun.

265
00:25:42,499 --> 00:25:45,584
And we could easily make that back
in one or two shows.

266
00:25:45,627 --> 00:25:47,002
I say we do it.

267
00:25:47,045 --> 00:25:49,004
- Me, too.
- Same here.

268
00:25:51,174 --> 00:25:54,927
All right, I'm in.

269
00:26:12,946 --> 00:26:14,863
I'm leaving.

270
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:19,076
You didn't tell me you'd visited your father.

271
00:26:19,119 --> 00:26:21,203
How did you find out?

272
00:26:21,246 --> 00:26:24,873
He called today.

273
00:26:24,916 --> 00:26:29,461
He was wondering if you'd like to go
have lunch with him next week.

274
00:26:29,504 --> 00:26:32,631
- Why?
- I don't know.

275
00:26:32,674 --> 00:26:35,593
Maybe you reminded him
that he's your father.

276
00:26:38,805 --> 00:26:41,181
Mom.

277
00:26:41,224 --> 00:26:44,059
Do you think I could borrow 50 dollars?

278
00:26:44,102 --> 00:26:46,562
What for?

279
00:26:46,605 --> 00:26:48,856
My band is doing a demo.

280
00:26:48,898 --> 00:26:53,027
Maggy, I thought we talked about this.
I don't have a spare 50 dollars.

281
00:26:53,069 --> 00:26:55,904
And I need to see some improvement
at school first.

282
00:26:55,947 --> 00:26:57,740
This is really important to me.

283
00:26:57,782 --> 00:27:00,993
I'll give you the money back.
I can't let my band down.

284
00:27:01,036 --> 00:27:02,953
I promise I'll do better in school.

285
00:27:02,996 --> 00:27:04,955
I'm sorry, Maggy.

286
00:27:04,998 --> 00:27:08,125
First you'll have to prove to me
that you're responsible.

287
00:27:10,170 --> 00:27:13,213
You know, other moms would support
their kids' talents,

288
00:27:13,256 --> 00:27:17,051
but you don't care at all about
what's important to me.

289
00:27:17,093 --> 00:27:22,181
I will support you when you get
your priorities straight.

290
00:28:10,313 --> 00:28:14,358
# Bring down the house,
you lost me in shadow #

291
00:28:14,401 --> 00:28:18,946
# We're breathing it now,
run from the day glow. #

292
00:28:18,988 --> 00:28:23,242
# Turn to react,
cry like a demon #

293
00:28:23,284 --> 00:28:27,663
# Feeling so bad,
it's burning, we're fleeing #

294
00:28:27,706 --> 00:28:32,000
# Deep, deep in ash,
falls like a powder #

295
00:28:32,043 --> 00:28:36,505
# Photos and cash,
it doesn't matter #

296
00:28:47,851 --> 00:28:50,602
Oh man, we totally killed it.

297
00:28:50,645 --> 00:28:52,730
He said he's going to play it right away.

298
00:28:52,772 --> 00:28:54,148
All right!

299
00:28:54,190 --> 00:28:55,941
That was the coolest experience ever.

300
00:28:55,984 --> 00:28:58,277
I could seriously do this
for the rest of my life.

301
00:28:58,319 --> 00:29:01,113
Tom said you all did a great job.

302
00:29:05,952 --> 00:29:07,828
# Bring down the house... #

303
00:29:07,871 --> 00:29:10,497
It's so cool to finally hear your sound
nicely recorded.

304
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:12,249
I loved your solo, by the way.

305
00:29:12,292 --> 00:29:13,292
Thanks, man.

306
00:29:13,334 --> 00:29:16,253
With this demo, we can get
our first tour organized.

307
00:29:16,296 --> 00:29:18,422
Feels like we're a real band now.

308
00:29:18,465 --> 00:29:20,132
To the band.

309
00:29:20,175 --> 00:29:21,425
To the band!

310
00:29:21,468 --> 00:29:23,427
Whoo!

311
00:29:25,263 --> 00:29:29,266
Today was the best day of my life.

312
00:29:29,309 --> 00:29:31,351
Thanks to you.

313
00:29:31,394 --> 00:29:33,729
I didn't do anything.

314
00:29:33,772 --> 00:29:39,401
You let me try out for the band.
You believed in me.

315
00:29:47,202 --> 00:29:50,412
I love you, Jay.

316
00:29:50,455 --> 00:29:53,373
I love you too, Pumpkin.

317
00:30:46,511 --> 00:30:47,761
There you are.

318
00:30:47,804 --> 00:30:50,055
I was waiting for you.

319
00:30:50,098 --> 00:30:51,390
You knew I was coming?

320
00:30:51,432 --> 00:30:52,891
Sure did.

321
00:30:52,934 --> 00:30:54,434
Who's the lucky one today?

322
00:30:54,477 --> 00:30:58,564
I don't know, but I have a very good feeling
about this one.

323
00:30:58,606 --> 00:31:01,400
Did you have a good feeling
when you wrote mine?

324
00:31:01,442 --> 00:31:02,568
A very good feeling.

325
00:31:02,610 --> 00:31:05,779
Like a "gift from heaven" kind of feeling.

326
00:31:05,822 --> 00:31:08,574
Thank you for that, by the way.

327
00:31:08,616 --> 00:31:10,284
So you write one every day?

328
00:31:10,326 --> 00:31:14,496
Yep. Gotta do it every day or it's not
gonna happen, you know.

329
00:31:14,539 --> 00:31:15,831
So where are we going?

330
00:31:15,874 --> 00:31:18,125
Ah, you'll see.

331
00:31:18,167 --> 00:31:19,835
Hello, Stanley.

332
00:31:19,878 --> 00:31:21,837
Stanley?

333
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:24,423
Stanley is my normal name.

334
00:31:24,465 --> 00:31:27,342
You can still call me Sam.

335
00:31:27,385 --> 00:31:29,303
My dear Stella.

336
00:31:29,345 --> 00:31:32,097
I want you to meet my good friend Maggy.

337
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:33,473
Stella, Maggy.

338
00:31:33,516 --> 00:31:34,850
Maggy, Stella.

339
00:31:34,893 --> 00:31:37,561
You're in for a real treat.

340
00:31:37,604 --> 00:31:42,399
What are we doing?
Sam...Stanley hasn't told me yet.

341
00:31:42,442 --> 00:31:46,361
You go bless other peoples' lives.
It's a lot of fun.

342
00:31:46,404 --> 00:31:48,280
I'll see you tonight, Stanley.

343
00:31:48,323 --> 00:31:50,407
It has been wonderful meeting you.

344
00:31:50,450 --> 00:31:52,409
Great to meet you too, Stella.

345
00:31:55,288 --> 00:31:56,788
One per envelope.

346
00:31:56,831 --> 00:31:57,873
What are these for?

347
00:31:57,916 --> 00:32:01,501
They're personal notes for people
who need them today.

348
00:32:01,544 --> 00:32:03,921
How do you know who needs them today?

349
00:32:03,963 --> 00:32:06,256
You feel it in your heart.

350
00:32:06,299 --> 00:32:09,927
It takes a bit of practice,
but it gets easier each time.

351
00:32:09,969 --> 00:32:13,764
So, you not only write letters,
but also personal notes every day?

352
00:32:13,806 --> 00:32:17,059
Well, I've got to have a reason
to get out a bit.

353
00:32:17,101 --> 00:32:18,977
So, who gets them?

354
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:21,772
I don't know yet.

355
00:32:21,814 --> 00:32:23,857
Let's look around.

356
00:32:31,407 --> 00:32:33,158
Do you feel something?

357
00:32:33,201 --> 00:32:36,328
Me? Not really.

358
00:32:36,371 --> 00:32:39,706
Yeah, I'm not sure either.

359
00:32:45,797 --> 00:32:47,714
Did you feel something?

360
00:32:47,757 --> 00:32:49,549
Yeah, me too.

361
00:33:04,691 --> 00:33:05,899
What did you tell her?

362
00:33:05,942 --> 00:33:09,528
I said I wrote 10 notes of encouragement
this morning

363
00:33:09,570 --> 00:33:13,073
and when I walked by her,
I felt one of them was meant for her.

364
00:33:13,116 --> 00:33:15,200
- And what did she say?
- Thank you.

365
00:33:15,243 --> 00:33:16,576
That's it?

366
00:33:16,619 --> 00:33:20,872
What did you want her to say?

367
00:33:46,357 --> 00:33:48,233
Go for it.

368
00:33:48,276 --> 00:33:51,319
- Me?
- Sure.

369
00:34:25,063 --> 00:34:27,314
That wasn't too bad, was it?

370
00:34:27,356 --> 00:34:31,068
Maybe you should let me read the notes
before I hand them to someone.

371
00:34:31,110 --> 00:34:33,737
Who knows what you
wrote on them.

372
00:34:37,116 --> 00:34:39,743
Thank you!

373
00:35:38,427 --> 00:35:40,220
There's a balance in all things.

374
00:35:40,263 --> 00:35:42,013
If you give, you will receive.

375
00:35:42,056 --> 00:35:44,599
If you give a lot, you'll be rich.

376
00:35:44,642 --> 00:35:48,353
I know what you mean, but I don't
think it's that simple.

377
00:35:48,396 --> 00:35:51,731
Most people are too absorbed
in their lives to recognize it.

378
00:35:53,484 --> 00:35:56,653
Maybe they tried and it didn't work,
so they stopped trying.

379
00:35:56,696 --> 00:35:58,196
But it does work.

380
00:35:58,239 --> 00:36:00,991
If you give of yourself, you'll be rewarded.

381
00:36:01,033 --> 00:36:03,201
You see, life is like a mirror.

382
00:36:03,244 --> 00:36:06,413
Who you are is reflected
by those around you.

383
00:36:06,455 --> 00:36:07,706
Like my friends.

384
00:36:07,748 --> 00:36:09,499
Yes, like your friends.

385
00:36:09,542 --> 00:36:14,713
For example, if someone steals or is
dishonest for their own advantage,

386
00:36:14,755 --> 00:36:20,051
they'll invite people into their lives
who also steal and are dishonest.

387
00:36:20,094 --> 00:36:24,472
The good thing is you can choose
who and what enters your life.

388
00:36:24,515 --> 00:36:27,517
If you want good and helping
people around you

389
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:29,519
be good and helping.

390
00:36:29,562 --> 00:36:33,273
It's magical. And it works for me.

391
00:36:33,316 --> 00:36:36,776
I'm not usually good and helping.

392
00:36:36,819 --> 00:36:40,780
You don't know me.
I'm a pretty bad person.

393
00:36:40,823 --> 00:36:43,450
I already told you, I know you better.

394
00:36:43,492 --> 00:36:47,621
You've been good and helping to me,
and I was lucky to get that part of you.

395
00:36:47,663 --> 00:36:50,624
See, it works for me.

396
00:36:54,128 --> 00:36:58,423
- You think I could have one of these?
- Sure.

397
00:36:58,466 --> 00:37:00,342
That means we still have one left.

398
00:37:00,384 --> 00:37:02,969
Better get rid of it quick.

399
00:37:03,012 --> 00:37:05,847
- Here's your check.
- Thank you.

400
00:37:12,563 --> 00:37:15,065
You know, I invented these.

401
00:37:15,107 --> 00:37:17,108
No, you didn't.

402
00:37:19,195 --> 00:37:21,154
Did you really?

403
00:37:23,074 --> 00:37:24,950
Why hello, Stella.

404
00:37:24,992 --> 00:37:29,704
You're back.
Did you have a good time?

405
00:37:29,747 --> 00:37:33,208
You better do it again soon.
It gets addictive.

406
00:37:33,251 --> 00:37:35,043
Maybe next week.

407
00:37:35,086 --> 00:37:36,711
I have a concert on Friday.

408
00:37:36,754 --> 00:37:40,173
A concert?
What instrument do you play?

409
00:37:40,216 --> 00:37:43,551
I don't play an instrument.
I'm only the singer.

410
00:37:43,594 --> 00:37:49,140
Only? The voice is the most beautiful
instrument of all.

411
00:37:49,183 --> 00:37:51,184
Stella used to be
an opera singer.

412
00:37:51,227 --> 00:37:53,895
Why don't we support Maggy
and go to her concert?

413
00:37:53,938 --> 00:37:55,730
I think that's a great idea.

414
00:37:55,773 --> 00:37:58,608
No, I don't think you guys would like it.

415
00:37:58,651 --> 00:37:59,943
It's not that kind of concert.

416
00:37:59,986 --> 00:38:02,070
It's with my band.
We're kind of loud.

417
00:38:02,113 --> 00:38:02,904
Oh.

418
00:38:02,947 --> 00:38:05,365
Yeah, it's just music for...

419
00:38:05,408 --> 00:38:09,744
For young people?
Not for old folks like us?

420
00:38:09,787 --> 00:38:13,290
I think we'd embarrass her if we go.

421
00:38:13,332 --> 00:38:15,292
No, no, that's not...

422
00:38:15,334 --> 00:38:17,585
Why don't you let us decide?

423
00:38:17,628 --> 00:38:20,839
We're not as old as we look, you know.

424
00:38:41,986 --> 00:38:43,069
Good job, Maggy.

425
00:38:43,112 --> 00:38:44,571
I finally see some improvement.

426
00:38:44,613 --> 00:38:46,531
Keep it up.

427
00:38:46,574 --> 00:38:48,742
Thank you.

428
00:38:48,784 --> 00:38:49,868
Not bad, Maggy.

429
00:38:49,910 --> 00:38:52,996
Seems like you finally get the drift.

430
00:38:53,039 --> 00:38:55,790
My mom is going to be happy.

431
00:38:55,833 --> 00:38:58,043
You're welcome.

432
00:39:01,255 --> 00:39:07,802
I feel guilty for neglecting you
all these years.

433
00:39:07,845 --> 00:39:09,929
I am really sorry.

434
00:39:13,059 --> 00:39:16,811
I'm just curious as to why it took you
this long to realize that?

435
00:39:16,854 --> 00:39:20,065
I mean, it's not like I've been living
on another planet.

436
00:39:20,107 --> 00:39:22,484
It's complicated.

437
00:39:22,526 --> 00:39:26,905
I didn't want to confuse you.
And your mother.

438
00:39:26,947 --> 00:39:30,909
I just thought a clean cut would be better
for everyone involved.

439
00:39:30,951 --> 00:39:33,828
Sure, a clean cut.
Better that way.

440
00:39:36,165 --> 00:39:39,626
It makes a huge difference
when you rip someone's heart out.

441
00:39:39,668 --> 00:39:41,586
Maggy, please forgive me.

442
00:39:42,838 --> 00:39:45,298
I did what I thought I had to do
at the time.

443
00:39:45,341 --> 00:39:50,220
And then when I saw you the other day,
I realized how stupid I was.

444
00:39:50,262 --> 00:39:54,808
How I missed all these
important years of your life.

445
00:39:54,850 --> 00:39:57,227
I want to...

446
00:39:57,269 --> 00:39:59,187
What?

447
00:39:59,230 --> 00:40:02,774
Nothing.

448
00:40:02,817 --> 00:40:04,275
I am very proud of you.

449
00:40:04,318 --> 00:40:06,027
You're a beautiful young woman.

450
00:40:06,070 --> 00:40:07,862
You've got a lot of potential.

451
00:40:07,905 --> 00:40:10,365
When I called your mother
the other day,

452
00:40:10,408 --> 00:40:12,283
she kept telling me how wonderful you are.

453
00:40:12,326 --> 00:40:14,911
Mom did?

454
00:40:14,954 --> 00:40:18,498
I doubt that. She never has
anything nice to say about me.

455
00:40:18,541 --> 00:40:20,875
That's not true.
She is very proud of you.

456
00:40:24,755 --> 00:40:28,258
And tomorrow is our first real concert.

457
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:31,553
It's a long shot, but it's what I want to do.

458
00:40:31,595 --> 00:40:34,222
I think you should follow
your dreams, Maggy.

459
00:40:35,933 --> 00:40:38,059
Like you did?

460
00:40:40,855 --> 00:40:44,732
I know you can do it.
Just don't ever give up.

461
00:41:36,494 --> 00:41:40,330
"Dear Letter Writer,
thank you for your kind words.

462
00:41:40,372 --> 00:41:42,916
You made me smile and my mommy cry.

463
00:41:42,958 --> 00:41:44,250
The good tears.

464
00:41:44,293 --> 00:41:46,377
Thank you for thinking of me.

465
00:41:46,420 --> 00:41:49,631
Next time, please stay
for milk and apple pie.

466
00:41:49,673 --> 00:41:52,133
Your friend, Michael."

467
00:41:57,556 --> 00:42:01,935
# Sun's coming out,
we'll follow the street #

468
00:42:01,977 --> 00:42:06,439
# We're bowing it out,
we find the street here #

469
00:42:06,482 --> 00:42:10,693
# Overreact,
cry like a demon #

470
00:42:10,736 --> 00:42:15,198
# Feeling so bad,
it's burning, we're fleeing #

471
00:42:15,241 --> 00:42:19,494
# Deep, deep in ash,
falls like a powder #

472
00:42:19,537 --> 00:42:24,374
# Photos and cash,
it doesn't matter #

473
00:43:19,388 --> 00:43:21,806
I totally didn't think
you guys would come.

474
00:43:21,849 --> 00:43:26,561
Stella pushed me into it.

475
00:43:26,604 --> 00:43:28,438
I hope it wasn't too loud.

476
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:30,064
It was just fine.

477
00:43:30,107 --> 00:43:34,152
I just had to take my hearing aids out.

478
00:43:34,194 --> 00:43:37,030
Sam, would you mind
if I dropped by tomorrow?

479
00:43:37,072 --> 00:43:41,117
- I was planning on it.
- Cool.

480
00:43:44,121 --> 00:43:48,374
Can you teach me how to write letters
like you, Sam?

481
00:43:48,417 --> 00:43:51,085
I don't know.

482
00:43:51,128 --> 00:43:53,004
What do you mean?

483
00:43:53,047 --> 00:43:55,506
It depends on you.

484
00:43:55,549 --> 00:43:59,302
Within every human being,
there's a God-given ability

485
00:43:59,345 --> 00:44:04,682
that if you find it and nurture it,
you'll be able to bless the lives of others.

486
00:44:04,725 --> 00:44:07,143
For me, it's writing letters.

487
00:44:08,979 --> 00:44:10,229
And for me?

488
00:44:10,272 --> 00:44:14,442
- You'll have to find out for yourself.
- How?

489
00:44:14,485 --> 00:44:16,903
You'll feel it in your heart.

490
00:44:16,945 --> 00:44:21,366
When you find it, you'll experience
a force and power within you

491
00:44:21,408 --> 00:44:23,368
that's greater than yourself.

492
00:44:23,410 --> 00:44:25,745
You'll feel connected to the Divine.

493
00:44:25,788 --> 00:44:31,584
There's nothing more empowering than
feeling connected to the Divine.

494
00:44:33,128 --> 00:44:35,338
I don't know how to write like you.

495
00:44:35,381 --> 00:44:39,384
I tried all morning, but it just doesn't
come out the way I want.

496
00:44:39,426 --> 00:44:43,096
You become good by what
you consistently do.

497
00:44:43,138 --> 00:44:46,140
It's only a matter of practice and desire.

498
00:44:46,183 --> 00:44:49,644
I promise you that if you do
something every day,

499
00:44:49,687 --> 00:44:51,896
you'll eventually master it.

500
00:44:51,939 --> 00:44:57,402
# ...helpers fail and comforts flee, #

501
00:44:57,444 --> 00:45:11,124
# Help of the helpless,
O abide with me. #

502
00:45:16,088 --> 00:45:17,171
Hello, Maggy.

503
00:45:17,214 --> 00:45:20,758
I told our group we might have
a real singer with us today.

504
00:45:20,801 --> 00:45:23,010
Would you mind singing for us?

505
00:45:23,053 --> 00:45:25,304
I don't know if I could sing.

506
00:45:25,347 --> 00:45:28,266
I say you do it.

507
00:45:28,308 --> 00:45:32,395
# Come, thou fount of every blessing #

508
00:45:32,438 --> 00:45:36,524
# Tune my heart to sing thy grace #

509
00:45:36,567 --> 00:45:40,653
# Streams of mercy never ceasing #

510
00:45:40,696 --> 00:45:44,490
# Call for songs of loudest praise #

511
00:45:44,533 --> 00:45:48,703
# Teach me some melodious sonnet #

512
00:45:48,746 --> 00:45:52,749
# Sung by flaming tongues above #

513
00:45:52,791 --> 00:45:57,003
# Praise the mount, I'm fixed upon it #

514
00:45:57,045 --> 00:46:00,965
# Mount of thy redeeming love #

515
00:46:06,054 --> 00:46:09,724
# Come, ye thankful people, come #

516
00:46:09,767 --> 00:46:13,644
# Raise the song of harvest home #

517
00:46:13,687 --> 00:46:20,985
# All is safely gathered in,
ere the winter storms begin... #

518
00:46:21,028 --> 00:46:22,820
Sam's birthday is in two weeks,

519
00:46:22,863 --> 00:46:25,865
and we thought we would surprise him
with a little program.

520
00:46:25,908 --> 00:46:27,200
That sounds great.

521
00:46:27,242 --> 00:46:31,245
And we thought we would all perform
together in a choir.

522
00:46:31,288 --> 00:46:35,208
We voted and decided that you
should be our conductor.

523
00:46:35,250 --> 00:46:39,545
Me? I don't really know
what that means.

524
00:46:39,588 --> 00:46:43,257
It means you make sure we don't
embarrass ourselves.

525
00:46:43,300 --> 00:46:47,136
And that we all sing together in harmony.

526
00:46:47,179 --> 00:46:49,263
I don't know if I could do that.

527
00:46:49,306 --> 00:46:50,598
I know you can.

528
00:46:50,641 --> 00:46:53,434
And don't tell Sam anything about it,
all right?

529
00:46:53,477 --> 00:46:55,269
All right.

530
00:46:55,312 --> 00:46:59,106
It would really mean a lot to him if
you came and visited.

531
00:46:59,149 --> 00:47:01,734
He's been sick for a while.

532
00:47:01,777 --> 00:47:04,946
Who can say no to milk
and apple pie?

533
00:47:08,367 --> 00:47:10,326
I'll let him know.

534
00:47:12,371 --> 00:47:14,997
How did you discover your talent, Sam?

535
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:17,458
Why do you write letters?

536
00:47:17,501 --> 00:47:20,586
Words.

537
00:47:20,629 --> 00:47:26,217
Many years ago, I had a heated argument
with a friend of mine.

538
00:47:26,260 --> 00:47:29,387
Soon after, she died.

539
00:47:29,429 --> 00:47:34,267
It suddenly hit me that I was using words
to hurt other people.

540
00:47:34,309 --> 00:47:37,019
And I was quite good at it.

541
00:47:37,062 --> 00:47:41,023
At that moment, and it felt like an eternity,

542
00:47:41,066 --> 00:47:47,321
I became fully aware of all the pain
that I had inflicted.

543
00:47:47,364 --> 00:47:51,284
The worst was that it was
too late to apologize

544
00:47:51,326 --> 00:47:53,327
and make amends to my friend.

545
00:47:56,456 --> 00:48:00,543
So, writing letters is like therapy for you.

546
00:48:00,586 --> 00:48:03,713
I knew I had to change.

547
00:48:03,755 --> 00:48:08,467
I decided then and there
that for the rest of my life

548
00:48:08,510 --> 00:48:10,803
I would only use words for good,

549
00:48:10,846 --> 00:48:14,891
to lift the broken-hearted
and heal the wounded.

550
00:48:14,933 --> 00:48:19,395
And that has been my desire
and purpose ever since.

551
00:48:24,151 --> 00:48:26,110
Hi, Mom.

552
00:48:30,866 --> 00:48:32,825
You're stealing from me?

553
00:48:35,412 --> 00:48:39,624
Borrowing.
I was planning on giving it back.

554
00:48:39,666 --> 00:48:44,587
I don't remember giving my consent.

555
00:48:44,630 --> 00:48:49,425
My own daughter is stealing from me.

556
00:48:49,468 --> 00:48:51,344
I'm so sorry, Mom.

557
00:48:51,386 --> 00:48:55,514
I wanted to put it back
before you found out.

558
00:49:01,438 --> 00:49:03,397
Mom, honestly, please.

559
00:49:07,611 --> 00:49:09,320
At first I didn't realize it,

560
00:49:09,363 --> 00:49:12,531
but then I noticed that both of you
not only had the same right answers,

561
00:49:12,574 --> 00:49:15,034
but also the same wrong ones.

562
00:49:15,077 --> 00:49:17,703
Which is clear evidence of cheating.

563
00:49:17,746 --> 00:49:21,123
So, who cheated?
Kim?

564
00:49:21,166 --> 00:49:24,418
Maggy? Both of you?

565
00:49:24,461 --> 00:49:29,507
If you don't talk,
I have to suspend you both.

566
00:49:29,549 --> 00:49:32,760
I didn't copy from her.

567
00:49:32,803 --> 00:49:36,931
And I write my own exams.

568
00:49:36,974 --> 00:49:42,228
Kim's grade is consistent
with her other grades,

569
00:49:42,270 --> 00:49:45,439
while Maggy's is not.

570
00:49:45,482 --> 00:49:47,441
Do you admit to cheating, Maggy?

571
00:49:52,489 --> 00:49:56,117
Yes, I cheated.

572
00:49:56,159 --> 00:49:58,202
I'm sorry.

573
00:49:58,245 --> 00:50:00,997
I'll have to give you an F
on the exam.

574
00:50:02,457 --> 00:50:05,459
And you can't sit next
to Kim anymore.

575
00:50:05,502 --> 00:50:07,670
If we ever catch you
cheating again

576
00:50:07,713 --> 00:50:11,424
we will notify your parents and consider
disciplinary measures.

577
00:50:13,927 --> 00:50:15,720
I'm sorry, Maggy.

578
00:50:17,556 --> 00:50:21,475
It's okay. It's a good thing
you didn't get caught.

579
00:50:23,812 --> 00:50:26,689
You should write your
own cheat slips in the future.

580
00:50:31,737 --> 00:50:34,488
Hey, please don't hate me.

581
00:51:01,058 --> 00:51:03,142
Hey, let's go.

582
00:51:05,020 --> 00:51:07,146
What's the matter?

583
00:51:09,149 --> 00:51:11,400
Maggy.

584
00:51:11,443 --> 00:51:16,113
I think it's better for both of us
if we break up.

585
00:51:16,156 --> 00:51:18,491
What?

586
00:51:18,533 --> 00:51:22,161
Why is that better?

587
00:51:22,204 --> 00:51:24,955
I just don't think we have a future together.

588
00:51:24,998 --> 00:51:27,833
- I'd like to move on.
- Move on?

589
00:51:31,046 --> 00:51:33,339
But what about the band?

590
00:51:33,381 --> 00:51:35,049
The band broke up, too.

591
00:51:35,092 --> 00:51:38,594
Pete just has issues.

592
00:51:38,637 --> 00:51:42,890
We could start a new band,
just you and me.

593
00:51:42,933 --> 00:51:44,642
But why not?

594
00:51:44,684 --> 00:51:48,896
If you don't wanna be with me,
that's fine, but the band?

595
00:51:48,939 --> 00:51:51,732
Please don't take the band
away from me.

596
00:51:54,277 --> 00:51:56,403
Maggy, please.

597
00:51:56,446 --> 00:51:57,780
You know it wouldn't work.

598
00:51:57,823 --> 00:51:59,532
But why?

599
00:51:59,574 --> 00:52:02,368
Because it's over.

600
00:52:02,410 --> 00:52:05,412
It just is.

601
00:52:17,843 --> 00:52:21,887
Maggy. Hey.

602
00:52:21,930 --> 00:52:24,181
What's going on?

603
00:52:24,224 --> 00:52:27,434
We're moving to North Carolina.

604
00:52:27,477 --> 00:52:29,728
What?

605
00:52:29,771 --> 00:52:32,148
I thought Jason told you.

606
00:52:37,362 --> 00:52:39,530
Maggy, wait.

607
00:53:04,931 --> 00:53:06,891
Kimmy, wait!

608
00:53:34,211 --> 00:53:36,295
I'm sorry, Maggy.
I wanted to tell you.

609
00:53:36,671 --> 00:53:38,756
What? That you're gonna
disappear again?

610
00:53:38,798 --> 00:53:41,884
I thought that if we could spend
a little time together

611
00:53:41,927 --> 00:53:44,428
it might be easier for you
to come visit.

612
00:53:44,471 --> 00:53:46,555
When are you leaving?

613
00:53:46,598 --> 00:53:49,308
Tomorrow.

614
00:53:49,351 --> 00:53:50,809
It was good to see you.

615
00:53:50,852 --> 00:53:54,355
Maggy, it's for you.

616
00:53:54,397 --> 00:53:56,982
Please stay in touch?

617
00:54:03,198 --> 00:54:05,157
You're late today.

618
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:08,160
I know, but I have some really
good news for you.

619
00:54:08,203 --> 00:54:09,119
What is it?

620
00:54:09,162 --> 00:54:13,082
I gave the letter writer your coupon,
and he accepts your invitation.

621
00:54:13,124 --> 00:54:15,417
Really, how did you do that?

622
00:54:15,460 --> 00:54:18,379
I have my ways.
When do you have time?

623
00:54:18,421 --> 00:54:21,840
My mom says I have to go
to the hospital again soon.

624
00:54:21,883 --> 00:54:23,634
Can he come tomorrow?

625
00:54:23,677 --> 00:54:26,720
I'll see what I can do.

626
00:54:26,763 --> 00:54:29,098
Michael, would you mind
showing me your letter?

627
00:54:29,140 --> 00:54:31,433
No, not at all.

628
00:54:36,856 --> 00:54:40,442
"I write to one of the bravest souls
known to man.

629
00:54:40,485 --> 00:54:44,697
Your spirit is unbroken, even though
you had to conquer so much.

630
00:54:44,739 --> 00:54:46,865
You have the strength of a lion.

631
00:54:46,908 --> 00:54:51,829
And despite your pain and suffering,
your smile is as bright as the sun

632
00:54:51,871 --> 00:54:55,040
and the heavens smile upon you
with affection.

633
00:54:55,083 --> 00:54:57,918
The love of God will follow you
wherever you go

634
00:54:57,961 --> 00:55:02,715
and your light will shine forth
throughout all eternity."

635
00:55:02,757 --> 00:55:06,218
Isn't that a nice letter?

636
00:55:06,261 --> 00:55:09,596
Yes. Yes it is, Michael.

637
00:55:09,639 --> 00:55:11,849
So, milk and apple pie tomorrow, right?

638
00:55:11,891 --> 00:55:13,851
I'm planning on it.

639
00:55:49,429 --> 00:55:51,638
Mr. Hansen.

640
00:55:51,681 --> 00:55:54,266
I wanted to apologize.

641
00:55:54,309 --> 00:55:58,771
I made a big mistake and I really let you down.

642
00:55:58,813 --> 00:56:01,398
How can I make things right?

643
00:56:01,441 --> 00:56:04,193
I know you can do better, Maggy.

644
00:56:04,235 --> 00:56:06,987
Just show me you really mean it,
all right?

645
00:56:09,074 --> 00:56:11,116
I can do that.

646
00:56:11,159 --> 00:56:13,160
Thank you.

647
00:56:28,968 --> 00:56:32,971
Sam. Sam?

648
00:56:33,014 --> 00:56:37,768
Sam! Sam!

649
00:56:37,811 --> 00:56:39,686
You saved my life.

650
00:56:39,729 --> 00:56:43,190
You scared me big time.
Don't ever do that to me again.

651
00:56:48,363 --> 00:56:53,826
I'm sorry, Maggy.
I'm a feeble old man.

652
00:56:53,868 --> 00:56:55,536
The world still needs you.

653
00:56:55,578 --> 00:56:58,038
You have hundreds of more letters to write.

654
00:56:58,081 --> 00:57:01,500
Well, maybe it's just your turn now.

655
00:57:01,543 --> 00:57:03,627
I'm terrible at writing letters.

656
00:57:03,670 --> 00:57:06,213
You'll figure it out.

657
00:57:06,256 --> 00:57:09,508
Be a little more easy on yourself.

658
00:57:09,551 --> 00:57:11,468
I know you have it in you.

659
00:57:11,511 --> 00:57:14,138
You'll find your voice.

660
00:57:14,180 --> 00:57:19,560
All you have to do is let it shine,
let it sing.

661
00:57:58,933 --> 00:58:01,935
What's going on, Kimmy?
Do you think I'm stupid?

662
00:58:01,978 --> 00:58:03,645
What are you talking about?

663
00:58:03,688 --> 00:58:05,230
I saw you with Jay yesterday.

664
00:58:05,273 --> 00:58:06,773
It's not what you think.

665
00:58:06,816 --> 00:58:07,733
Then what is it?

666
00:58:07,775 --> 00:58:10,319
It's nothing.
And why do you even care?

667
00:58:10,361 --> 00:58:14,239
I thought you two broke up.

668
00:58:17,827 --> 00:58:21,747
Looks like your band is doing just fine
without you after all.

669
00:58:28,004 --> 00:58:30,339
Surprise.

670
00:58:30,381 --> 00:58:33,550
Let me introduce my two best friends.

671
00:58:33,593 --> 00:58:36,595
Sam, this is Michael.
Michael, this is Sam.

672
00:58:36,638 --> 00:58:37,804
Hi, Michael.

673
00:58:37,847 --> 00:58:40,015
Michael brought milk and apple pie.

674
00:58:40,058 --> 00:58:43,936
On, great.

675
00:58:43,978 --> 00:58:46,688
Thank you for your letter, Sam.

676
00:58:46,731 --> 00:58:48,899
Thank you for yours, Michael.

677
00:58:48,942 --> 00:58:51,485
And for the invitation, too.

678
00:58:51,528 --> 00:58:55,989
Milk and apple pie.
What a wonderful idea.

679
00:58:59,577 --> 00:59:02,204
I love it.

680
00:59:02,247 --> 00:59:06,333
I'm sorry I took the money.

681
00:59:06,376 --> 00:59:08,126
I know it was wrong.

682
00:59:08,169 --> 00:59:13,006
I'll never do it again.

683
00:59:13,049 --> 00:59:16,093
I want you to be able
to trust me.

684
00:59:28,022 --> 00:59:35,320
I always hoped Dad would be there for me,
but he never was.

685
00:59:35,363 --> 00:59:38,991
Well...

686
00:59:39,033 --> 00:59:43,036
It's not entirely his fault
things didn't work out.

687
00:59:43,079 --> 00:59:46,081
I can be pretty stubborn too,
you know.

688
00:59:49,669 --> 00:59:52,129
I'm not mad at him anymore.

689
00:59:55,508 --> 00:59:59,386
He's got a family now and he has
to take care of them.

690
00:59:59,429 --> 01:00:02,180
I might even go visit them someday.

691
01:00:06,352 --> 01:00:12,691
But I know now that he isn't
really there for me.

692
01:00:12,734 --> 01:00:14,860
Probably never will be.

693
01:00:14,902 --> 01:00:19,948
But you always are, Mom.

694
01:00:19,991 --> 01:00:23,285
And I never appreciated anything
you did for me.

695
01:00:30,209 --> 01:00:35,714
I just want you to be happy,
make good choices.

696
01:00:39,510 --> 01:00:43,180
I love you, baby.

697
01:00:43,222 --> 01:00:48,685
# Come, thou fount
of every blessing #

698
01:00:48,728 --> 01:00:55,359
# Come, thou fount of every blessing #

699
01:00:55,401 --> 01:01:01,865
# Tune my heart to sing thy grace #

700
01:01:01,908 --> 01:01:08,372
# Streams of mercy never ceasing #

701
01:01:08,414 --> 01:01:15,504
# Call for songs of loudest praise #

702
01:01:17,507 --> 01:01:20,217
I'm sorry.
He passed away this morning.

703
01:01:23,888 --> 01:01:25,597
No, he was feeling better.

704
01:01:25,640 --> 01:01:28,975
He was supposed to be released
at the end of the week.

705
01:01:29,018 --> 01:01:31,478
Are you sure?

706
01:01:31,521 --> 01:01:35,857
Yeah.
I'm so sorry.

707
01:02:34,292 --> 01:02:37,961
No birthday surprise party.

708
01:02:38,004 --> 01:02:40,630
He had a good life.

709
01:02:40,673 --> 01:02:43,300
And he went out on a high note.

710
01:02:43,342 --> 01:02:44,801
You think so?

711
01:02:44,844 --> 01:02:46,136
I know so.

712
01:02:46,179 --> 01:02:49,806
He was very impressed with you
and thought of you as an apprentice.

713
01:02:49,849 --> 01:02:51,641
He wanted you to continue his work.

714
01:02:51,684 --> 01:02:54,060
But I'm not a letter writer.

715
01:02:54,103 --> 01:02:55,937
I can't write like he did.

716
01:02:55,980 --> 01:03:00,525
Don't worry, you'll know what to do.

717
01:03:00,568 --> 01:03:05,071
Let's sing our song.
It'll cheer us up.

718
01:03:05,114 --> 01:03:07,991
Sam would have liked that.

719
01:03:08,034 --> 01:03:12,537
I'm sorry, I just... I really don't
feel like singing today.

720
01:04:27,530 --> 01:04:32,826
...I am the resurrection, amen.

721
01:05:40,853 --> 01:05:44,940
# Bring down the house,
you lost me in shadow #

722
01:05:44,982 --> 01:05:48,902
# We're breathing it now,
run from the day glow. #

723
01:05:48,945 --> 01:05:50,737
# Turn to react... #

724
01:05:50,780 --> 01:05:53,531
That's my song.

725
01:05:53,574 --> 01:05:55,909
They're playing my song.

726
01:05:55,952 --> 01:05:58,203
# Feeling so bad,
it's burning, we're fleeing #

727
01:05:58,245 --> 01:06:02,540
# Deep, deep in ash,
falls like a powder #

728
01:06:02,583 --> 01:06:07,629
# Photos and cash,
it doesn't matter #

729
01:06:07,672 --> 01:06:10,215
Kimmy.

730
01:06:10,257 --> 01:06:13,885
You know...life is like a mirror.

731
01:06:13,928 --> 01:06:17,514
And what you see is eventually
what you're going to get.

732
01:06:17,556 --> 01:06:21,434
And at some point it all reflects
back on you.

733
01:06:21,477 --> 01:06:28,775
I saw you at the concert.
It hurt.

734
01:06:28,818 --> 01:06:35,115
But I have to admit, you were great.

735
01:06:35,157 --> 01:06:38,493
I think the band is really lucky
to have you.

736
01:06:41,956 --> 01:06:46,376
I really hope you find
what you're looking for.

737
01:06:52,758 --> 01:06:57,220
I think I understand now what Sam
was trying to teach me.

738
01:06:57,263 --> 01:06:59,806
And what was that?

739
01:06:59,849 --> 01:07:03,685
He didn't want me to be a letter writer.

740
01:07:03,728 --> 01:07:07,522
He wanted me to use my own talent
to bless other people's lives

741
01:07:07,565 --> 01:07:09,733
just like he did with his.

742
01:07:09,775 --> 01:07:13,278
- And I know what that is now.
- You do?

743
01:07:13,320 --> 01:07:17,198
It's my voice.
That's my talent.

744
01:07:17,241 --> 01:07:21,786
I love to sing, I just never used it
for good or to help others.

745
01:07:21,829 --> 01:07:27,584
You knew it all along, didn't you?
And Sam probably did, too.

746
01:07:27,626 --> 01:07:29,586
That's why you asked me
to join the choir.

747
01:07:33,007 --> 01:07:36,968
I love the choir,
and I love singing with you.

748
01:07:40,264 --> 01:07:43,850
I have something for you.

749
01:07:43,893 --> 01:07:49,647
Sam wanted you to have this,
as soon as you were ready.

750
01:07:49,690 --> 01:07:53,109
You are ready now.

751
01:08:26,060 --> 01:08:30,188
"Dear Maggy, I have been blessed
with your presence in my life.

752
01:08:30,231 --> 01:08:35,110
Now that I'm gone, it's time
to pass on to you this key.

753
01:08:35,152 --> 01:08:40,573
It is a symbol of your ability to unlock
any door on your path to happiness.

754
01:08:40,616 --> 01:08:46,913
It represents a golden key
of opportunity and potential.

755
01:08:46,956 --> 01:08:48,289
Choose wisely.

756
01:08:48,332 --> 01:08:53,086
You probably weren't aware of it,
but this key has been with you all your life.

757
01:08:53,129 --> 01:08:55,880
You just haven't learned to use it yet.

758
01:08:55,923 --> 01:09:00,218
Whatever you want to accomplish in your life,
you have the key to do so.

759
01:09:00,261 --> 01:09:01,553
It is the same key

760
01:09:01,595 --> 01:09:06,432
that allows you to find happiness
and fulfillment in this life.

761
01:09:06,475 --> 01:09:09,727
And with which you
can bless others.

762
01:09:09,770 --> 01:09:14,816
Always remember that this key is
yours and yours alone.

763
01:09:14,859 --> 01:09:19,195
Whenever you find yourself blaming
others for your circumstances,

764
01:09:19,238 --> 01:09:21,239
look at the key.

765
01:09:21,282 --> 01:09:23,533
It cannot be taken away from you.

766
01:09:23,576 --> 01:09:28,955
You alone decide, which doors to open
and which paths to take.

767
01:09:28,998 --> 01:09:33,710
This is the gift of your life and you alone
hold the key to it."

768
01:09:35,754 --> 01:09:39,757
"Lightning splintered across
the putty colored sky

769
01:09:39,800 --> 01:09:41,968
and the Captain had a foreboding sense
that he should have

770
01:09:42,011 --> 01:09:43,970
turned the sailboat around sooner."

771
01:09:44,013 --> 01:09:47,515
And why should I let you do that?

772
01:09:47,558 --> 01:09:53,146
Because I know that I can do better.
I can be better.

773
01:09:53,189 --> 01:09:56,399
I just really want to make my mom proud.

774
01:09:56,442 --> 01:09:59,027
All right.

775
01:09:59,069 --> 01:10:02,906
Let me see what I can do.

776
01:10:02,948 --> 01:10:09,579
# Praise the mount,
I'm fixed upon it #

777
01:10:09,622 --> 01:10:17,795
# Mount of thy redeeming love #

778
01:10:46,742 --> 01:10:49,869
"Lightning
splintered across the putty colored sky

779
01:10:49,912 --> 01:10:52,372
and the Captain had a foreboding sense
that he should have

780
01:10:52,414 --> 01:10:54,958
turned the sailboat around sooner.

781
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:58,711
One of the local fishermen had warned him
earlier that it would be a full moon..."

782
01:11:31,745 --> 01:11:37,667
# Praise the mount,
I'm fixed upon it #

783
01:11:37,710 --> 01:11:45,216
# Mount of thy redeeming love #

784
01:11:45,259 --> 01:11:47,802
We brought some milk
and apple pie for you.

785
01:11:47,845 --> 01:11:48,970
Thank you.

786
01:11:49,013 --> 01:11:53,224
And here is your personal invitation.
I hope you can make it.

787
01:11:53,267 --> 01:11:55,226
My mom says I'm doing a lot better

788
01:11:55,269 --> 01:11:57,645
and I'm going to be able
to go home soon.

789
01:11:57,688 --> 01:12:00,398
That's the greatest news
I've ever heard, Michael.

790
01:12:00,441 --> 01:12:03,735
And guess what?
My hair is gonna grow back, too.

791
01:12:25,215 --> 01:12:27,008
Hey.

792
01:12:27,051 --> 01:12:29,385
You're still up?

793
01:12:35,059 --> 01:12:38,603
Do you think you'll be able
to make it tomorrow?

794
01:12:38,645 --> 01:12:43,024
I'm going to do my best
to get off work.

795
01:12:43,067 --> 01:12:46,027
But you know how they can be.

796
01:12:50,491 --> 01:12:53,493
Thank you, Mom.

797
01:12:53,535 --> 01:12:57,705
Thank you for not giving up on me.

798
01:12:57,748 --> 01:13:00,833
It's all right.

799
01:13:00,876 --> 01:13:04,587
I wish things could be different.

800
01:13:04,630 --> 01:13:13,179
I wish we still had a happy home
and I could support you more.

801
01:13:13,222 --> 01:13:17,850
And honey, I am so sorry that your dad
and I got divorced

802
01:13:17,893 --> 01:13:20,269
and you've had to go
through all this.

803
01:13:23,065 --> 01:13:26,025
We can still have a happy home.

804
01:13:30,280 --> 01:13:36,035
I feel really lucky that you're my mom.

805
01:14:14,283 --> 01:14:16,367
Okay, guys, bam it out on three.

806
01:14:16,410 --> 01:14:21,038
One, two, three, bam it out!

807
01:14:23,292 --> 01:14:24,375
You ready?

808
01:14:24,418 --> 01:14:29,255
- Yeah.
- Let's do it.

809
01:14:29,298 --> 01:14:32,842
And with this program ,
we wish you a Happy Thanksgiving.

810
01:14:32,885 --> 01:14:34,802
Thank you.

811
01:15:17,930 --> 01:15:23,518
And now we have a special performance
from one of our students,

812
01:15:23,560 --> 01:15:26,187
Maggy Fuller.

813
01:15:54,716 --> 01:16:03,391
I want to dedicate this song to Sam,
who showed me the key to happiness.

814
01:16:03,433 --> 01:16:10,690
And to Michael, whose beautiful spirit
can never be broken.

815
01:16:10,732 --> 01:16:16,070
And to my mom, who works tirelessly
and puts up with me

816
01:16:16,113 --> 01:16:20,741
and never gets anything in return.

817
01:16:20,784 --> 01:16:23,661
I love you, Mom.

818
01:16:43,765 --> 01:16:48,978
# You're a flower blooming in the new dawn. #

819
01:16:49,021 --> 01:16:54,358
# The colors 'round the setting sun,
a candle in the dark. #

820
01:16:54,401 --> 01:17:00,072
# And you're every sailor's
beacon on the shore. #

821
01:17:00,115 --> 01:17:02,825
# You're every perfect metaphor. #

822
01:17:02,868 --> 01:17:08,205
# There's a culminating
action of a song. #

823
01:17:08,248 --> 01:17:13,919
# Sometimes there are miracles
and our hands do the job. #

824
01:17:13,962 --> 01:17:20,426
# And for every action,
you move these things along. #

825
01:17:20,469 --> 01:17:25,514
# Everything you do moves
these along. #

826
01:17:25,557 --> 01:17:31,145
# Angels are hiding
in the motions of humans. #

827
01:17:31,188 --> 01:17:36,400
# Angels are around to help us all. #

828
01:17:36,443 --> 01:17:42,323
# We are angels hiding
in the bones of humans. #

829
01:17:42,366 --> 01:17:47,703
# Helping all these miracles along. #

830
01:17:47,746 --> 01:17:53,250
# There's a golden key
that opens any lock. #

831
01:17:53,293 --> 01:17:58,714
# The path to get the thing you want
is never really blocked. #

832
01:17:58,757 --> 01:18:04,512
# And you're every person's
escort to the door. #

833
01:18:04,554 --> 01:18:10,059
# And every other person is yours. #

834
01:18:10,102 --> 01:18:15,481
# Every other person is yours. #

835
01:18:15,524 --> 01:18:20,569
# Angels are hiding
in the motions of humans. #

836
01:18:20,612 --> 01:18:25,700
# Angels are around to help us all. #

837
01:18:25,742 --> 01:18:31,622
# We are angels hiding
in the bones of humans. #

838
01:18:31,665 --> 01:18:37,002
# Helping all these miracles along. #

839
01:18:58,608 --> 01:19:04,155
# Angels are hiding
in the motions of humans. #

840
01:19:04,197 --> 01:19:09,535
# Angels are around to help us all. #

841
01:19:09,578 --> 01:19:15,541
# We are angels hiding
in the bones of humans. #

842
01:19:15,584 --> 01:19:20,296
# Helping all these miracles along. #

843
01:19:20,338 --> 01:19:23,382
# Along. #

844
01:19:58,084 --> 01:20:00,586
Honey, that was...

845
01:20:00,629 --> 01:20:03,756
That was so beautiful.

846
01:20:07,385 --> 01:20:10,095
Thank you, Mom.

847
01:20:10,138 --> 01:20:14,558
For everything.

848
01:20:56,351 --> 01:20:57,977
"Dear Sam.

849
01:20:58,019 --> 01:21:00,688
You left us, and we miss you a lot.

850
01:21:00,730 --> 01:21:03,858
But we can still feel
your presence and love.

851
01:21:03,900 --> 01:21:07,611
We have come here today
to celebrate your life.

852
01:21:07,654 --> 01:21:10,322
Happy birthday, Sam.

853
01:21:10,365 --> 01:21:13,450
You will always live on
in our hearts.

854
01:21:25,088 --> 01:21:31,218
# Come, thou fount of every blessing #

855
01:21:31,261 --> 01:21:37,766
# Tune my heart to sing thy grace #

856
01:21:37,809 --> 01:21:44,398
# Streams of mercy never ceasing #

857
01:21:44,441 --> 01:21:51,155
# Call for songs of loudest praise #

858
01:21:51,197 --> 01:21:57,411
# Teach me some melodious sonnet #

859
01:21:57,454 --> 01:22:03,918
# Sung by flaming tongues above #

860
01:22:03,960 --> 01:22:10,716
# Praise the mount, I'm fixed upon it #

861
01:22:10,759 --> 01:22:19,308
# Mount of thy redeeming love #
