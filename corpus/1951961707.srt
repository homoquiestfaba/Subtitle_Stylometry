1
00:00:53,091 --> 00:00:56,690
PRAGUE.

2
00:01:01,003 --> 00:01:03,709
<i>My job takes me to alot of places.</i>

3
00:01:03,710 --> 00:01:05,941
<i>It's got its downsides.</i>

4
00:01:05,942 --> 00:01:11,525
<i>I sleep alone... I eat alone,
I'm used to it though.</i>

5
00:01:12,276 --> 00:01:14,674
<i>I'd like to meet someone.</i>

6
00:01:14,738 --> 00:01:18,410
<i>But it's tough when you
live out of a suitcase.</i>

7
00:01:18,813 --> 00:01:23,240
<i>I go where I'm told...
Do what I'm told.</i>

8
00:01:23,241 --> 00:01:24,971
<i>I shouldn't complain...</i>

9
00:01:24,972 --> 00:01:28,652
<i>The work is steady,
the money's good.</i>

10
00:01:28,653 --> 00:01:31,612
<i>But it's not for everyone.</i>

11
00:04:05,163 --> 00:04:08,178
<i>My name's Joe.</i>

12
00:04:09,592 --> 00:04:12,871
<i>This is what I do.</i>

13
00:04:58,132 --> 00:05:00,610
You're late.

14
00:05:00,956 --> 00:05:05,010
Sorry Mr Lindsay,
they're closing off streets.

15
00:05:13,737 --> 00:05:16,343
You are leaving?

16
00:05:16,972 --> 00:05:19,898
I need the phone.

17
00:05:29,064 --> 00:05:33,426
- Um... I can help with the bags, sir?
- No, I can handle it.

18
00:05:40,829 --> 00:05:43,918
If you ever come back, I can...
I can use the money.

19
00:05:46,032 --> 00:05:48,895
Goodbye.

20
00:06:05,352 --> 00:06:08,210
<i>I was taught 4 rules.</i>

21
00:06:08,211 --> 00:06:11,706
<i>One: Don't ask questions.</i>

22
00:06:11,733 --> 00:06:14,856
<i>There is no such thing
as right and wrong.</i>

23
00:06:14,857 --> 00:06:19,431
<i>Two: Don't take any interest
in people outside of work.</i>

24
00:06:19,432 --> 00:06:21,799
<i>There is no such thing as trust.</i>

25
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:25,081
<i>Three: Erase every trace.</i>

26
00:06:25,082 --> 00:06:28,856
<i>Come anonymous,
and leave nothing behind.</i>

27
00:06:29,333 --> 00:06:32,990
<i>Four: Know when to get out.</i>

28
00:06:32,991 --> 00:06:36,366
<i>Just thinking about it,
is a waist of time.</i>

29
00:06:36,367 --> 00:06:41,284
<i>Before you lose your edge,
before you become a target.</i>

30
00:06:57,379 --> 00:07:02,264
<i>So you look for the right oppurtunity.
Nothing too risky.</i>

31
00:07:02,413 --> 00:07:06,318
<i>Get the money,
and disappear forever.</i>

32
00:07:06,874 --> 00:07:11,410
<i>This is it, 4 hits in one location.</i>

33
00:07:11,411 --> 00:07:14,482
<i>The last job.</i>

34
00:07:15,807 --> 00:07:18,836
Purpose of your visit
to Bangkok, Mr. Windsor?

35
00:07:18,837 --> 00:07:20,537
Holiday.

36
00:07:29,090 --> 00:07:34,435
<i>Bangkok...
it's corrupt, dirty and dense.</i>

37
00:08:00,515 --> 00:08:03,954
<i>All my clients
have one thing in common.</i>

38
00:08:04,044 --> 00:08:06,519
<i>They feed off the people.</i>

39
00:08:06,868 --> 00:08:09,454
<i>There's big money in misery.</i>

40
00:08:09,455 --> 00:08:12,241
<i>Where there's money
there's competition.</i>

41
00:08:12,313 --> 00:08:15,682
<i>And the guy paying me
usually wins.</i>

42
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,655
How will we know when he's arrived?

43
00:08:21,805 --> 00:08:24,715
We'll know when he arranges the pick-up.

44
00:08:25,921 --> 00:08:28,396
You're sure he's reliable?

45
00:08:28,397 --> 00:08:31,483
The Russians swear by him.

46
00:08:35,886 --> 00:08:38,892
How do you swear by...

47
00:08:39,169 --> 00:08:41,808
a man you've never met?

48
00:08:41,809 --> 00:08:45,459
We don't know him,
he doesn't know us.

49
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:48,218
It's better for us that way...

50
00:08:52,106 --> 00:08:54,771
<i>It always starts the same way.</i>

51
00:08:54,772 --> 00:08:57,170
<i>Just like I was taught.</i>

52
00:08:57,171 --> 00:08:59,113
<i>Secure a safe location.</i>

53
00:08:59,114 --> 00:09:02,549
<i>Somewhere off the beaten path
where you have privacy.</i>

54
00:09:02,550 --> 00:09:04,523
<i>But you stay invisible too long...</i>

55
00:09:04,524 --> 00:09:07,844
<i>the human race
looks like another species.</i>

56
00:09:07,845 --> 00:09:11,009
<i>So you venture out, you observe...</i>

57
00:09:11,010 --> 00:09:14,012
<i>and then you return to your
invisible world.</i>

58
00:09:14,013 --> 00:09:16,858
<i>Like a ghost.</i>

59
00:09:29,296 --> 00:09:31,436
- Hey, look Larry...
- What?

60
00:09:31,437 --> 00:09:33,037
Over here.

61
00:09:34,537 --> 00:09:37,596
I've been here a couple of times.

62
00:09:37,597 --> 00:09:39,405
Hello gentlemen how are you?

63
00:09:39,406 --> 00:09:40,840
- First time in Bangkok?
- Yep.

64
00:09:40,841 --> 00:09:43,340
Rolex good quality...
Yes, yes, look, good, good Rolex...

65
00:09:43,401 --> 00:09:46,696
Watch out, Larry,
you wanna bet, it's counterfeit.

66
00:09:46,697 --> 00:09:48,896
- Good, good.
- No thanks, no thanks.

67
00:09:48,929 --> 00:09:51,696
No, no, no, nevermind, nevermind...
You want girls?

68
00:09:51,697 --> 00:09:53,598
- I can get you girls.
- No, pal...

69
00:09:53,599 --> 00:09:56,398
No girls, how about boys?
You like boys?

70
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:57,898
- No...
- You don't like boys?

71
00:09:57,899 --> 00:10:00,062
- No, I'm sorry, pal.
- Hey, how about you, huh?

72
00:10:00,063 --> 00:10:02,418
5000 bath, you have the special...

73
00:10:02,419 --> 00:10:05,719
money back you're not satisfied
with pussy guarantee, hey?

74
00:10:05,754 --> 00:10:07,653
Whatever happens in Bangkok,
stays in Bangkok.

75
00:10:07,654 --> 00:10:10,760
<i>Wanna find garbage,
go to a garbage dump.</i>

76
00:10:10,761 --> 00:10:12,760
<i>I look for three qualifications.</i>

77
00:10:12,761 --> 00:10:14,870
<i>They have to speak
a little English.</i>

78
00:10:14,871 --> 00:10:18,100
<i>They have to wanna make money.
And above all:</i>

79
00:10:18,101 --> 00:10:21,545
<i>They have to be disposable.</i>

80
00:10:23,716 --> 00:10:28,050
You wanna make some money?
I have work in town.

81
00:10:28,051 --> 00:10:29,922
I need some help.

82
00:10:29,923 --> 00:10:31,446
What work?

83
00:10:31,447 --> 00:10:33,890
Pick things up, drop things off.

84
00:10:33,891 --> 00:10:36,986
Maybe some translation.

85
00:10:37,215 --> 00:10:41,031
About a month's work...
Two thousand a day.

86
00:10:43,173 --> 00:10:45,981
- Dollar.
- Baht.

87
00:10:45,982 --> 00:10:49,181
Bullshit, uh.

88
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:57,830
Five thousand, eh?
Twenty-five hundred...

89
00:10:58,051 --> 00:11:01,071
Four thousand?

90
00:11:01,072 --> 00:11:05,510
2 thousand, 9 hundred and fifty-two-fifty...
I do it, huh?... What'd you think? Come on.

91
00:11:05,511 --> 00:11:09,998
We'll round up... 3 thousand.
You get paid at the end of the week.

92
00:11:09,999 --> 00:11:11,622
No deal.

93
00:11:11,623 --> 00:11:14,060
Uh... okay, okay, uh...
how about, uh... half...

94
00:11:14,061 --> 00:11:16,960
half now half at the end of the week, eh?

95
00:11:18,510 --> 00:11:21,383
- What's your name?
- Kong.

96
00:11:21,384 --> 00:11:23,693
Kong?

97
00:11:27,406 --> 00:11:30,845
You can keep that
in the wallet you stole.

98
00:11:32,051 --> 00:11:35,308
Pier 21 Santaham Road,
tomorrow 7pm.

99
00:11:35,309 --> 00:11:39,338
You come alone, or you don't get paid.

100
00:11:39,486 --> 00:11:42,660
Yes boss.

101
00:12:15,805 --> 00:12:17,972
- Take off the shades.
- Huh?

102
00:12:17,973 --> 00:12:20,273
Glasses... off.

103
00:12:27,685 --> 00:12:30,722
Keep that with you at all times.

104
00:12:30,723 --> 00:12:33,783
- I have good phone.
- Now you have two.

105
00:12:33,784 --> 00:12:36,075
You answer whenever it rings.

106
00:12:36,076 --> 00:12:41,484
If I call and you don't answer,
you don't get paid.

107
00:12:43,995 --> 00:12:47,972
Time... it's very important.

108
00:12:47,973 --> 00:12:54,535
If I tell you to be somewhere
and you are a minute... late...

109
00:12:54,536 --> 00:12:58,310
you don't get paid.
You understand?

110
00:12:58,446 --> 00:13:00,727
- Birdshit foreigner.
- In English.

111
00:13:00,728 --> 00:13:02,572
I understand.

112
00:13:02,851 --> 00:13:06,111
- You know the Caribbean Club?
- High class ass.

113
00:13:06,112 --> 00:13:08,411
Ask for a dancer named Aom.

114
00:13:08,412 --> 00:13:12,103
You give her this... make sure
the X is facing up like this.

115
00:13:12,104 --> 00:13:16,155
She's gonna give you a package.
Don't... open it.

116
00:13:16,156 --> 00:13:19,007
- What's in it?
- It doesn't concern you.

117
00:13:19,008 --> 00:13:21,863
Then you go pick it up.

118
00:13:21,884 --> 00:13:23,184
I'll find someone else.

119
00:13:23,185 --> 00:13:26,684
Okay, okay, okay...
I... I do it, I do it, I do it.

120
00:13:28,370 --> 00:13:32,176
Come straight back here.
You don't stop for anything.

121
00:13:32,177 --> 00:13:35,174
What if I have to piss? uh?

122
00:13:35,602 --> 00:13:42,207
- If... you ask me one more question...
- And I won't get paid, I know that.

123
00:13:45,006 --> 00:13:48,133
- Okay I go now.
- Hey...

124
00:13:48,346 --> 00:13:51,488
Take the cell phone.

125
00:13:53,847 --> 00:13:56,117
Duck fucker.

126
00:14:30,591 --> 00:14:32,590
Hey, excuse me...

127
00:14:32,591 --> 00:14:35,585
I came to see Aom in here?

128
00:14:35,609 --> 00:14:38,295
The girl in the front.

129
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:42,094
Thank you.

130
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:20,182
What you looking at?

131
00:15:59,182 --> 00:16:00,330
Fucking, cops.

132
00:16:23,135 --> 00:16:26,133
- You're late, huh?
- Give me the case.

133
00:16:29,140 --> 00:16:31,299
- You don't get paid for today.
- Why not?

134
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:33,144
"Ran from the police".

135
00:16:33,171 --> 00:16:34,551
You told me not to stop.

136
00:16:34,552 --> 00:16:37,734
I do what you say, don't stop...
don't stop for nothing, not even for piss.

137
00:16:37,735 --> 00:16:40,900
From now on I don't want anymore police.

138
00:16:40,901 --> 00:16:43,587
You understand?

139
00:16:51,241 --> 00:16:53,806
Fuck your mother.

140
00:17:16,957 --> 00:17:21,228
<i>The human face can mislead
in a thousand different ways.</i>

141
00:17:22,017 --> 00:17:25,243
<i>But the eyes never change.</i>

142
00:17:25,244 --> 00:17:28,523
<i>I was taught
to start with the eyes.</i>

143
00:18:38,282 --> 00:18:40,881
I'm Kong.

144
00:19:26,145 --> 00:19:29,671
Heroin?
Yeah, heroin.

145
00:19:32,024 --> 00:19:34,935
Give him what he needs.

146
00:19:47,913 --> 00:19:50,071
Hey, wai... wait... wait.

147
00:19:52,926 --> 00:19:55,446
The elephant.

148
00:19:55,447 --> 00:19:59,406
The trunk... huh, the nose
you see pointing down.

149
00:19:59,407 --> 00:20:02,107
Bad luck.
No good.

150
00:20:02,108 --> 00:20:06,064
- Bad luck for you.
- Good night.

151
00:22:24,416 --> 00:22:27,615
I'm checking on a wire transfer.

152
00:22:28,461 --> 00:22:34,134
Account code 651-4346.

153
00:22:37,774 --> 00:22:40,301
Thank you.

154
00:23:15,734 --> 00:23:19,555
Hello.
Um... I have a... a cut...

155
00:23:19,556 --> 00:23:25,291
and I need some...
medicine... disinfectant.

156
00:23:25,808 --> 00:23:28,991
Do you speak English?

157
00:24:11,696 --> 00:24:14,231
How many?

158
00:24:16,334 --> 00:24:18,908
Huh... one.

159
00:24:23,805 --> 00:24:27,389
In... huh, in the morning?
In the morning!

160
00:24:27,550 --> 00:24:32,278
One... before bed.

161
00:24:44,025 --> 00:24:46,600
Two hundred and fifty-five cents.

162
00:24:53,900 --> 00:24:56,585
- Thank you!
- Thanks...

163
00:25:09,096 --> 00:25:11,678
Oh, I have it.

164
00:25:29,102 --> 00:25:32,815
Excuse me... excuse me.
How much are these?

165
00:25:32,816 --> 00:25:36,663
Those are 20 thousand Baht...
20 thousand.

166
00:25:36,664 --> 00:25:39,374
- 20 thousand, eh?
- Yes.

167
00:26:21,616 --> 00:26:24,983
They're beautiful.

168
00:26:48,532 --> 00:26:51,373
Where's my money, damn it?

169
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:48,281
- You're late.
- Sorry boss.

170
00:27:48,282 --> 00:27:51,142
Don't be sorry. Be on time.

171
00:27:51,143 --> 00:27:54,434
What happened to your face?

172
00:27:55,552 --> 00:28:00,568
Some assholes tried to mug me.
Like twenty of them.

173
00:28:01,416 --> 00:28:04,783
But I kicked their asses.

174
00:28:07,126 --> 00:28:11,519
I'm so sorry boss.
So sorry.

175
00:28:12,516 --> 00:28:15,022
They... they take...

176
00:28:16,332 --> 00:28:18,542
It's been opened.

177
00:28:18,563 --> 00:28:21,360
Not me. It's them...
They broke it.

178
00:28:21,361 --> 00:28:24,709
But I won't let them have it.
I got it back for you.

179
00:28:26,908 --> 00:28:29,899
I don't let them have it.

180
00:28:30,913 --> 00:28:36,433
There's a beer in the refrigerator.
It'll take down the swelling.

181
00:28:43,349 --> 00:28:46,444
- He's a bad man, huh?
- Who?

182
00:28:46,601 --> 00:28:51,234
The man in the case.
You're going to kill him?

183
00:28:57,228 --> 00:28:58,542
Can you teach me?

184
00:28:58,543 --> 00:29:02,071
- Teach you what?
- Everything.

185
00:29:02,911 --> 00:29:05,517
I can help you.

186
00:29:17,617 --> 00:29:19,967
Please?

187
00:29:21,899 --> 00:29:23,255
Show me.

188
00:29:57,250 --> 00:29:59,370
Again.

189
00:30:01,182 --> 00:30:03,506
Again.

190
00:30:03,507 --> 00:30:05,801
Again.

191
00:30:06,999 --> 00:30:09,285
Again.

192
00:30:10,370 --> 00:30:12,703
Again.

193
00:30:18,719 --> 00:30:21,101
Again.

194
00:30:25,208 --> 00:30:27,574
Good.

195
00:30:39,335 --> 00:30:42,182
That was your first lesson.

196
00:30:47,817 --> 00:30:51,047
<i>Why didn't I kill him?</i>

197
00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:56,609
<i>Maybe it's because...
And this is strange...</i>

198
00:30:56,998 --> 00:31:00,525
<i>somehow...
when I looked into his eyes...</i>

199
00:31:00,566 --> 00:31:03,524
<i>I saw myself.</i>

200
00:31:04,186 --> 00:31:06,698
<i>So I became his teacher.</i>

201
00:31:06,699 --> 00:31:08,022
The best way to defend yourself...

202
00:31:11,423 --> 00:31:14,605
You have to learn,
to read your surroundings.

203
00:31:14,606 --> 00:31:17,521
See that man in the red jacket?

204
00:31:21,409 --> 00:31:23,157
What man?

205
00:31:30,455 --> 00:31:32,168
You're living in a city of mirrors.

206
00:31:32,169 --> 00:31:36,733
Store windows, glass office buildings,
polished steel...

207
00:31:36,861 --> 00:31:39,956
eyes in the back of your head.

208
00:31:41,179 --> 00:31:42,987
Ahh...

209
00:31:45,879 --> 00:31:49,087
Eyes in the back of my head, eh boss, huh?
I got you now boss.

210
00:31:49,088 --> 00:31:52,008
I'm not your boss,
I'm your teacher.

211
00:31:52,109 --> 00:31:55,017
So I call you a dandy

212
00:32:04,973 --> 00:32:07,035
- Ready?
- Yeah.

213
00:32:08,352 --> 00:32:10,136
How is he bad?

214
00:32:10,224 --> 00:32:14,513
This man. He has many country girls...

215
00:32:14,514 --> 00:32:17,973
from the north.
He buys them from their parents...

216
00:32:17,974 --> 00:32:21,396
and sell them. Young girls, man.

217
00:32:22,397 --> 00:32:27,178
He as same like devil, huh?
This guy.

218
00:35:33,911 --> 00:35:39,278
Notorious gangster Pramod Juntasa,
was found dead last night.

219
00:35:39,279 --> 00:35:44,078
Notorious gangster Pramod Juntasa,
was found dead last night.

220
00:35:48,857 --> 00:35:50,256
Ahh...

221
00:35:50,257 --> 00:35:53,967
Mother fucker...
he got what he deserved.

222
00:36:05,878 --> 00:36:08,068
How many people have you killed?

223
00:36:08,069 --> 00:36:10,168
I don't think about that.

224
00:36:11,369 --> 00:36:14,603
Do the police know who you are?

225
00:36:16,306 --> 00:36:21,011
No one knows who I am.
No one knows where I am.

226
00:36:22,474 --> 00:36:25,375
I know.

227
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:32,080
- How many jobs in Bangkok?
- Four.

228
00:36:32,081 --> 00:36:36,258
Four?
Roulette right.

229
00:37:21,049 --> 00:37:22,942
You like?

230
00:37:51,749 --> 00:37:54,042
Huh...

231
00:37:54,126 --> 00:37:56,696
Um, I...

232
00:37:59,804 --> 00:38:01,069
Huh...

233
00:38:01,104 --> 00:38:02,601
Can you... can you help me?

234
00:38:02,602 --> 00:38:06,801
Can you tell her,
that I wanna take her to dinner.

235
00:38:06,802 --> 00:38:08,003
Oh, right.

236
00:38:52,529 --> 00:38:56,032
It's... huh, hot.

237
00:39:17,613 --> 00:39:19,729
That's just...

238
00:39:27,980 --> 00:39:30,747
Just eat it?

239
00:39:34,580 --> 00:39:37,939
It's cooling it down.

240
00:39:55,763 --> 00:39:59,738
It's hot again...
It's really hot.

241
00:40:03,379 --> 00:40:06,818
Oh, the whole thing.

242
00:40:08,504 --> 00:40:11,871
Now, that's better.

243
00:40:28,966 --> 00:40:34,183
You don't pull the trigger...
you squeeze it.

244
00:41:16,265 --> 00:41:18,823
- It's yours.
- What?

245
00:41:19,204 --> 00:41:21,266
Congratulations.

246
00:42:06,974 --> 00:42:09,476
It's best if he doesn't know us.

247
00:42:10,892 --> 00:42:14,277
But we should know more about him.

248
00:43:16,311 --> 00:43:18,786
Where... where?
In...

249
00:43:21,719 --> 00:43:23,868
Okay...

250
00:43:54,722 --> 00:43:56,668
- Boss!
- Yeah?

251
00:43:56,669 --> 00:44:00,771
I come as a problem,
I think they been following me.

252
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:04,745
Be at the chow pride ferry station
in twenty minutes.

253
00:44:04,746 --> 00:44:05,943
Okay boss.

254
00:44:05,944 --> 00:44:07,743
- Wait for my call.
- Yes, boss.

255
00:44:11,159 --> 00:44:16,572
Okay, listen carefully...
Open the case, 65-32-15.

256
00:44:16,573 --> 00:44:18,893
Put your cellphone in the case,
and leave it.

257
00:44:18,894 --> 00:44:20,594
Got it.

258
00:45:06,186 --> 00:45:08,921
The case has returned.

259
00:45:27,962 --> 00:45:31,585
- Yes?
- Put your boss on.

260
00:45:41,576 --> 00:45:44,389
- Yes.
- We had an arrangement.

261
00:45:44,390 --> 00:45:49,099
If I see your people again,
I'll kill your wife.

262
00:45:56,440 --> 00:45:59,671
We'll try again.

263
00:46:39,362 --> 00:46:42,217
Thank you very much.

264
00:46:43,323 --> 00:46:45,592
Where is he from?

265
00:46:45,729 --> 00:46:47,852
America, I think.

266
00:46:52,156 --> 00:46:54,678
What is his work?

267
00:46:54,779 --> 00:46:56,845
I don't know, ask him.

268
00:46:57,921 --> 00:46:59,020
Ah, sir...

269
00:46:59,021 --> 00:47:04,304
- Well... what is your work?
- Oh, ah...

270
00:47:05,405 --> 00:47:07,104
It's banking.

271
00:47:07,105 --> 00:47:12,070
- B... Banker?
- Bank... Banker, yes.

272
00:47:13,961 --> 00:47:17,136
A good job.

273
00:47:19,231 --> 00:47:22,213
I'll leave you two alone.

274
00:48:02,334 --> 00:48:04,811
Rain.

275
00:48:08,876 --> 00:48:11,113
Rain...

276
00:48:12,584 --> 00:48:17,073
is you?
Your name means rain?

277
00:48:17,675 --> 00:48:21,979
This... is your name.

278
00:49:53,194 --> 00:49:56,741
- Bad man?
- Bad for somebody.

279
00:49:57,142 --> 00:50:00,296
Floating Market.
Where is Damnoen Saduak?

280
00:50:00,297 --> 00:50:03,758
Ratchaburi province.
Hour and a half by car.

281
00:50:09,323 --> 00:50:14,065
Get some sleep.
We leave early.

282
00:51:13,848 --> 00:51:17,070
Dock the boat up on the right.

283
00:52:06,106 --> 00:52:09,016
Hey mister you buy something?
Buy something?

284
00:52:09,017 --> 00:52:12,016
Come on buy something, buy something,
you buy... buy something...

285
00:52:16,017 --> 00:52:18,016
Buy... buy... buy...

286
00:52:22,504 --> 00:52:25,949
Get us outta here. Get us out!

287
00:52:29,432 --> 00:52:32,390
Dock the boat on the left.

288
00:52:33,060 --> 00:52:36,018
- Come on, faster. Hurry up.
- Forward, let's go.

289
00:54:24,097 --> 00:54:26,360
Get me over there.

290
00:54:30,340 --> 00:54:33,126
Move!

291
00:54:59,726 --> 00:55:01,226
Shit.

292
00:55:06,835 --> 00:55:08,335
Fuck.

293
00:55:41,986 --> 00:55:44,578
God, no!

294
00:56:11,472 --> 00:56:14,349
Fuck.

295
00:56:41,085 --> 00:56:43,730
Take it to the club.

296
00:56:43,820 --> 00:56:46,657
- He's same like you, you know.
- Who?

297
00:56:46,692 --> 00:56:49,278
This guy, on TV.

298
00:56:51,203 --> 00:56:54,258
He fights bad guys,
and helps the poor.

299
00:56:54,259 --> 00:56:57,134
Thai people love him.

300
00:56:58,375 --> 00:57:00,747
He's a very good man...

301
00:57:01,841 --> 00:57:05,704
Same like you. Bad guy.

302
00:58:13,479 --> 00:58:15,893
"FIFTY COINS - FIFTY WISHES"

303
00:59:38,245 --> 00:59:42,766
"I am happy together with you"

304
00:59:44,245 --> 00:59:45,966
Freeze!

305
01:02:20,583 --> 01:02:24,872
Four: Know when it's time to get out.

306
01:02:32,878 --> 01:02:36,591
Three: Erase every trace.

307
01:02:39,302 --> 01:02:42,013
Boss?

308
01:02:42,553 --> 01:02:48,234
Two: Don't take any interest
in people outside work.

309
01:02:58,907 --> 01:03:02,842
One: Don't ask questions.

310
01:03:05,970 --> 01:03:11,692
"He's a very good man,
same like you"

311
01:04:01,611 --> 01:04:05,089
Political assassination
wasn't in the contract.

312
01:04:05,090 --> 01:04:07,451
So there are two ways to go.

313
01:04:07,464 --> 01:04:10,503
Refuse the job and walk away now...

314
01:04:10,504 --> 01:04:15,185
or... do the job and walk away rich.

315
01:04:17,375 --> 01:04:21,301
The truth is...
almost anyone can take out a politician.

316
01:04:21,302 --> 01:04:23,282
It's not the hard part.

317
01:04:23,283 --> 01:04:27,543
The hard part is getting away with it.

318
01:04:37,383 --> 01:04:39,373
He wants more money.

319
01:04:45,087 --> 01:04:48,042
It's a big job. There's risk.

320
01:04:53,063 --> 01:04:55,870
Yes. He knows who we are.

321
01:04:56,558 --> 01:04:58,212
If he were caught...

322
01:04:58,897 --> 01:05:00,435
it could lead back to us.

323
01:05:01,863 --> 01:05:03,242
What about the messenger?

324
01:05:04,798 --> 01:05:07,611
We should erase every link.

325
01:05:07,612 --> 01:05:08,911
The girl too.

326
01:05:09,801 --> 01:05:12,045
Just to be safe.

327
01:05:13,875 --> 01:05:15,882
I'll take care of it.

328
01:05:24,930 --> 01:05:27,750
- I gotta go.
- He can wait.

329
01:05:27,751 --> 01:05:30,095
He's counting on me.

330
01:06:02,597 --> 01:06:05,058
Kong.

331
01:06:08,146 --> 01:06:11,603
Be here tomorrow at 6pm.

332
01:06:12,791 --> 01:06:15,416
- Last job?
- Yeah.

333
01:06:15,417 --> 01:06:19,161
- Bad man?
- Bad for somebody.

334
01:06:19,266 --> 01:06:21,945
See you tomorrow boss.

335
01:06:54,652 --> 01:06:59,052
Call him, or we do to your sister...
what we did to you.

336
01:07:02,073 --> 01:07:03,946
Call him!

337
01:07:23,273 --> 01:07:25,646
Aom?

338
01:07:34,874 --> 01:07:37,480
Kong!

339
01:07:41,855 --> 01:07:42,955
I'm sorry.

340
01:07:49,955 --> 01:07:52,055
Where is he staying?

341
01:08:01,290 --> 01:08:02,977
Aom.

342
01:08:09,490 --> 01:08:14,477
Tell me where he is staying!
Or I'll cut her tits off! Huh?

343
01:10:51,004 --> 01:10:54,122
He fights bad guys,
and helps the poor.

344
01:10:54,123 --> 01:10:57,019
Thai people love him.

345
01:13:57,929 --> 01:14:00,834
<i>When the nightmare becomes real,
you don't hesitate...</i>

346
01:14:00,835 --> 01:14:03,597
<i>you don't think.
You just run.</i>

347
01:14:03,598 --> 01:14:07,197
<i>Anyone in the way goes down.
It's pretty simple.</i>

348
01:14:07,198 --> 01:14:12,246
<i>You're the target now, leave the
country, or you're going to die.</i>

349
01:15:44,683 --> 01:15:46,996
Where is Kong?

350
01:15:46,997 --> 01:15:48,925
Where is Kong?

351
01:15:50,126 --> 01:15:52,977
Why the fuck you care?

352
01:15:53,054 --> 01:15:55,757
- He's my student.
- Go to hell.

353
01:15:59,121 --> 01:16:00,831
Where is Kong?

354
01:16:02,004 --> 01:16:04,077
Surat.

355
01:16:04,278 --> 01:16:06,856
He's with Surat.

356
01:16:16,368 --> 01:16:18,482
Still no answer.

357
01:16:18,483 --> 01:16:20,865
Maybe he killed them.

358
01:16:21,590 --> 01:16:24,156
He's only one man.

359
01:18:21,721 --> 01:18:24,455
Hey! What's wrong?

360
01:18:24,836 --> 01:18:26,854
Look, he's right there!

361
01:18:26,857 --> 01:18:28,309
Let's go!

362
01:18:42,748 --> 01:18:45,217
What's happening?

363
01:18:51,248 --> 01:18:56,217
He's out here, let's find him,
don't let him inside.

364
01:19:30,911 --> 01:19:33,261
Can you see him?

365
01:20:02,326 --> 01:20:04,588
What's happening down there?

366
01:20:04,661 --> 01:20:06,770
Somebody turn on light!

367
01:23:05,726 --> 01:23:08,694
Where is Kong?

368
01:24:44,054 --> 01:24:47,212
I had to tell them.

369
01:24:53,199 --> 01:24:57,046
Take her into the street.
And clear the way.

370
01:24:57,447 --> 01:24:59,108
I got one more job.

371
01:24:59,109 --> 01:25:03,165
- Surat?
- Yeah, he's very bad.

372
01:26:20,246 --> 01:26:21,891
Come on.

373
01:26:21,992 --> 01:26:23,990
Come on.

374
01:26:37,846 --> 01:26:39,244
What're you doing?

375
01:26:39,246 --> 01:26:43,753
Get up! Do something! Come on.
Let's go!
