1
00:00:22,555 --> 00:00:23,822
Yup, absolutely.

2
00:00:23,857 --> 00:00:25,958
Corporate thinks
everything looks good.

3
00:00:25,992 --> 00:00:27,793
The restaurant's only
been open a month,

4
00:00:27,827 --> 00:00:29,795
and the new double-Decker pizza
is a hit.

5
00:00:30,830 --> 00:00:32,331
Oh.

6
00:00:34,768 --> 00:00:35,968
Not to worry,

7
00:00:36,002 --> 00:00:37,569
I'll talk to marketing about
the new midas pizza signage.

8
00:00:37,604 --> 00:00:39,605
Yeah.

9
00:00:39,639 --> 00:00:41,373
Uh-huh?

10
00:00:42,442 --> 00:00:43,308
Great.

11
00:00:43,343 --> 00:00:46,378
How's the new
pretzel crust tracking?

12
00:01:01,428 --> 00:01:02,428
Thank you!

13
00:01:02,929 --> 00:01:04,830
Hey, Zoe.
Chai tea latte.

14
00:01:04,864 --> 00:01:06,098
Thanks, I'll get you
back after work.

15
00:01:06,132 --> 00:01:08,567
Everyone just went into
the update meeting.

16
00:01:08,601 --> 00:01:10,369
Do me a favor,
put this on my desk?

17
00:01:10,403 --> 00:01:10,903
Sure.

18
00:01:10,937 --> 00:01:12,371
Loving the new shoes.

19
00:01:12,405 --> 00:01:13,205
Franc hills?

20
00:01:13,239 --> 00:01:16,275
Thank you, and yes,
and gotta go.

21
00:01:18,278 --> 00:01:23,482
Glad to see that everyone
could make it this morning.

22
00:01:23,516 --> 00:01:24,616
All right,

23
00:01:24,651 --> 00:01:25,951
let's start.

24
00:01:25,985 --> 00:01:29,721
Q4 was excellent for
international corporate brands.

25
00:01:29,756 --> 00:01:30,923
We are projecting

26
00:01:30,957 --> 00:01:32,558
one of our most
profitable years...

27
00:01:38,131 --> 00:01:40,766
All right, let's focus,
people, please.

28
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:41,967
Let's start with
jungle juicery.

29
00:01:42,001 --> 00:01:44,736
Now, the chain grew
to 50 stores last year,

30
00:01:44,771 --> 00:01:48,340
which in anyone's book
is quite the accomplishment.

31
00:01:54,814 --> 00:01:55,781
I got reservations
for us

32
00:01:55,815 --> 00:01:58,784
at erimea tonight at 7:30.

33
00:01:58,818 --> 00:02:00,419
Wilhelmina Jones...

34
00:02:00,453 --> 00:02:01,453
My office.

35
00:02:02,522 --> 00:02:03,489
Yikes.

36
00:02:03,523 --> 00:02:05,257
Full name, not good.

37
00:02:08,361 --> 00:02:08,827
Yup.

38
00:02:09,896 --> 00:02:11,563
If this is about
me being late, sir,

39
00:02:11,598 --> 00:02:12,564
I really want
to apologize.

40
00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:13,665
Sit down.

41
00:02:15,135 --> 00:02:17,069
Icb recently purchased
a small regional chain

42
00:02:17,103 --> 00:02:18,937
that corporate wants
to re-brand and expand.

43
00:02:18,972 --> 00:02:21,073
Now, they want to
jump on this asap.

44
00:02:21,107 --> 00:02:22,875
So we need to make sure
all the restaurants

45
00:02:22,909 --> 00:02:24,843
are compliant with
corporate standards:

46
00:02:24,878 --> 00:02:27,479
The new logos, signage,
and, obviously, the menus.

47
00:02:27,514 --> 00:02:28,514
Exactly.

48
00:02:28,548 --> 00:02:30,015
We think it has the potential
to go national.

49
00:02:30,049 --> 00:02:32,651
And how many stores
currently?

50
00:02:32,685 --> 00:02:33,986
Six, in two states.

51
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:36,455
Who's the compliance
director?

52
00:02:36,489 --> 00:02:38,757
You.

53
00:02:38,791 --> 00:02:39,992
Me?

54
00:02:40,026 --> 00:02:41,593
You've been working
your tail off

55
00:02:41,628 --> 00:02:42,594
on the midas pizza account,

56
00:02:42,629 --> 00:02:43,428
and I think it's time

57
00:02:43,463 --> 00:02:45,531
you took the lead
on your own project.

58
00:02:45,565 --> 00:02:47,065
Wow. Larry, thank you.

59
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:48,934
Now, all the stores
are transitioning smoothly

60
00:02:48,968 --> 00:02:50,035
to icb standards...

61
00:02:50,069 --> 00:02:52,471
Well, that makes my job easier.

62
00:02:52,505 --> 00:02:53,872
Except for one.

63
00:02:53,907 --> 00:02:55,641
They're not returning
our calls or emails.

64
00:02:55,675 --> 00:02:56,909
And it's not just any store.

65
00:02:56,943 --> 00:02:58,977
It's the original
flagship restaurant,

66
00:02:59,012 --> 00:03:00,779
and the founding family
still runs it.

67
00:03:00,813 --> 00:03:02,814
Okay, so
a little more complicated.

68
00:03:02,849 --> 00:03:04,650
Yeah, and we need you
to un-complicate it.

69
00:03:04,684 --> 00:03:06,518
Copy that.

70
00:03:06,553 --> 00:03:07,419
Now, this is
a chance for you

71
00:03:07,453 --> 00:03:09,488
to show us what
you've got, Ms. Jones.

72
00:03:09,989 --> 00:03:13,492
Get it handled quickly,
you're looking at a promotion.

73
00:03:14,861 --> 00:03:15,861
So, get packed.

74
00:03:15,895 --> 00:03:18,597
I need you up there
and all over this brand,

75
00:03:18,631 --> 00:03:19,598
first thing
in the morning.

76
00:03:19,632 --> 00:03:21,433
Yes, thank you.
Thank you.

77
00:03:22,835 --> 00:03:23,869
Oh, I almost forgot.

78
00:03:23,903 --> 00:03:24,836
What is the brand?

79
00:03:24,871 --> 00:03:26,371
Uh... hart's.

80
00:03:26,973 --> 00:03:28,907
And the problem store?

81
00:03:28,942 --> 00:03:30,909
Some fly-over town
in Tennessee.

82
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:32,611
Sycamore... something.

83
00:03:32,645 --> 00:03:34,479
Springs?

84
00:03:34,514 --> 00:03:35,847
Yeah, that's it.

85
00:03:35,882 --> 00:03:37,549
Sycamore Springs.

86
00:03:40,687 --> 00:03:42,521
You're from sycamore Springs?

87
00:03:43,623 --> 00:03:45,524
But you're, like, cool.

88
00:03:46,593 --> 00:03:47,826
Thank you.

89
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:49,661
When's the last time
you were there?

90
00:03:49,696 --> 00:03:51,830
15 years ago.

91
00:03:51,864 --> 00:03:52,965
And your parents
still live there?

92
00:03:52,999 --> 00:03:54,600
No, they moved to Florida.

93
00:03:54,634 --> 00:03:55,934
Oh, natch.

94
00:03:55,969 --> 00:03:57,936
But my crazy aunt tali
still lives there,

95
00:03:57,971 --> 00:03:59,871
married to her art.

96
00:03:59,906 --> 00:04:01,807
And I sort of know
the owner of the restaurant.

97
00:04:01,841 --> 00:04:03,408
That's good, right?

98
00:04:03,443 --> 00:04:04,610
No.

99
00:04:04,644 --> 00:04:06,311
He's the father of the guy
I used to date in high school.

100
00:04:06,346 --> 00:04:07,379
Yikes.

101
00:04:07,413 --> 00:04:10,315
And now it's supes awkward
'cause he dumped you?

102
00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:10,849
No.

103
00:04:10,883 --> 00:04:12,084
I broke up with him

104
00:04:12,118 --> 00:04:13,852
when I finally
got outta that place.

105
00:04:13,886 --> 00:04:15,554
How'd he take it?

106
00:04:17,624 --> 00:04:18,824
Not well.

107
00:04:18,858 --> 00:04:20,993
But, I mean, what was I
supposed to do?

108
00:04:21,027 --> 00:04:23,695
Stay in sycamore Springs
for the rest of my life,

109
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:25,797
when my high school
boyfriend's goals

110
00:04:25,832 --> 00:04:28,567
were fishing
and drinking beer?

111
00:04:28,601 --> 00:04:29,668
I made it very clear

112
00:04:29,702 --> 00:04:30,902
that I wanted more
out of my life,

113
00:04:30,937 --> 00:04:32,871
and just because he chose
to stay in that sleepy cow town,

114
00:04:32,905 --> 00:04:34,606
doesn't mean that
I have to throw away

115
00:04:34,641 --> 00:04:36,408
the rest of my life.

116
00:04:37,143 --> 00:04:40,679
Sounds like you have
some unresolved issues.

117
00:04:40,713 --> 00:04:42,614
They're the ones with issues.

118
00:04:43,116 --> 00:04:45,951
Maybe you could turn it
into a little vacay?

119
00:04:45,985 --> 00:04:47,452
Is Reed going with you?

120
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:48,654
Reed!

121
00:04:48,688 --> 00:04:49,855
He's supposed to
pick me up in an hour.

122
00:04:49,889 --> 00:04:51,523
I have to get ready.

123
00:04:51,557 --> 00:04:52,524
Where's he taking you?

124
00:04:52,558 --> 00:04:54,593
Erimea.

125
00:04:54,627 --> 00:04:56,595
Wow! Nice.

126
00:04:56,629 --> 00:04:58,597
You think he might...

127
00:04:58,631 --> 00:04:59,865
Put a ring on it?

128
00:05:01,934 --> 00:05:03,435
You think
he's going to...?

129
00:05:03,469 --> 00:05:05,470
Mm-hmm.

130
00:05:14,881 --> 00:05:16,415
I have something for you.

131
00:05:19,719 --> 00:05:21,553
Surprise.

132
00:05:22,722 --> 00:05:24,623
It's our new condo.

133
00:05:26,492 --> 00:05:27,859
Our condo?

134
00:05:27,894 --> 00:05:28,894
Mina, we've been
together

135
00:05:28,928 --> 00:05:30,062
for two years,
one month, and five days.

136
00:05:30,096 --> 00:05:32,564
I think it's time
we take our relationship

137
00:05:32,598 --> 00:05:34,633
to the next level.

138
00:05:34,667 --> 00:05:35,634
Will you move in with me?

139
00:05:35,668 --> 00:05:37,703
Wow.

140
00:05:37,737 --> 00:05:39,638
I'm just... shocked.

141
00:05:39,672 --> 00:05:40,872
Right?

142
00:05:40,907 --> 00:05:42,708
It was on the cover of
"modern interiors" last month.

143
00:05:42,742 --> 00:05:45,010
What do you say?

144
00:05:45,044 --> 00:05:47,646
Part of me
wants to say yes,

145
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,514
and move in tomorrow,

146
00:05:49,549 --> 00:05:51,016
and throw parties

147
00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:52,951
on that ridiculously
huge balcony.

148
00:05:52,985 --> 00:05:54,586
Then just say yes.

149
00:05:55,888 --> 00:05:56,955
But a bigger part of me

150
00:05:56,989 --> 00:05:58,690
always imagined
I'd be married first.

151
00:05:58,725 --> 00:06:00,892
I know, I know,

152
00:06:00,927 --> 00:06:02,627
it's old-fashioned, but...

153
00:06:02,662 --> 00:06:05,430
It's how I was raised.

154
00:06:05,465 --> 00:06:06,598
Sweetie,

155
00:06:06,632 --> 00:06:07,599
a lifelong partnership

156
00:06:07,633 --> 00:06:08,867
is about mindful transitioning

157
00:06:08,901 --> 00:06:10,435
from one phase of life
to the next.

158
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:12,571
Moving in together

159
00:06:12,605 --> 00:06:13,939
is just the first step.

160
00:06:13,973 --> 00:06:15,507
It's all part of
my five-year plan.

161
00:06:15,541 --> 00:06:17,409
Five-year plan?

162
00:06:17,443 --> 00:06:17,943
Mm-hmm.

163
00:06:17,977 --> 00:06:18,944
We date for two years,

164
00:06:18,978 --> 00:06:20,011
live together
for about a year,

165
00:06:20,046 --> 00:06:22,581
so we can get used to
each other's life rhythms.

166
00:06:22,615 --> 00:06:23,482
Both of us get promotions,

167
00:06:23,516 --> 00:06:25,617
and then,
once we're financially secure,

168
00:06:25,651 --> 00:06:26,685
we get married.

169
00:06:26,719 --> 00:06:28,620
And a year after that,
you can quit

170
00:06:28,654 --> 00:06:30,389
and raise our one baby.

171
00:06:30,423 --> 00:06:31,957
One baby?

172
00:06:31,991 --> 00:06:33,725
You know it's not responsible

173
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:35,727
or globally sustainable
to have more.

174
00:06:35,762 --> 00:06:37,863
Right, sure,

175
00:06:37,897 --> 00:06:41,500
I guess I just thought
I might have a say in that.

176
00:06:41,534 --> 00:06:43,468
I'm overwhelming you.

177
00:06:43,503 --> 00:06:44,569
I can see it.

178
00:06:44,604 --> 00:06:45,604
I do this,

179
00:06:45,638 --> 00:06:46,605
I get so excited
about something,

180
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:47,606
and then I just...

181
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:48,673
Look, Reed.

182
00:06:48,708 --> 00:06:50,642
It's a beautiful condo,

183
00:06:50,676 --> 00:06:51,710
it's just...

184
00:06:52,779 --> 00:06:53,745
I'm about to leave
out of town

185
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:54,980
for this job,

186
00:06:55,014 --> 00:06:57,582
and I'm just not
in the best place

187
00:06:57,617 --> 00:07:00,652
to make such
a big decision.

188
00:07:00,686 --> 00:07:03,655
Let me think about it.

189
00:07:05,458 --> 00:07:07,259
I guess that's fair.

190
00:07:18,704 --> 00:07:20,939
♪ ... t-shirts and blue jeans
instead of them suits ♪

191
00:07:21,974 --> 00:07:24,876
♪ ... ever wonder
where your road ends... ♪

192
00:07:29,515 --> 00:07:31,450
What?

193
00:07:43,629 --> 00:07:44,596
Oh!

194
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:45,697
Come on!

195
00:07:45,731 --> 00:07:47,732
My franc hills?

196
00:07:52,672 --> 00:07:54,573
Hey, guys.

197
00:07:54,607 --> 00:07:55,574
Hey.

198
00:07:56,609 --> 00:07:57,609
Really?

199
00:07:57,643 --> 00:07:58,710
Today?

200
00:08:00,546 --> 00:08:01,613
Shoo!

201
00:08:01,647 --> 00:08:02,614
Take your friends.

202
00:08:02,648 --> 00:08:03,748
Get along.

203
00:08:03,783 --> 00:08:04,749
Giddy up.

204
00:08:04,784 --> 00:08:05,750
Go!

205
00:08:05,785 --> 00:08:08,553
Oh, look what I got here.

206
00:08:08,588 --> 00:08:09,554
Yeah, uh-huh.

207
00:08:09,589 --> 00:08:10,655
Right this way.

208
00:08:10,690 --> 00:08:11,656
Yeah.

209
00:08:11,691 --> 00:08:14,559
Okay, one down.

210
00:08:14,594 --> 00:08:15,660
Who's next?

211
00:08:32,979 --> 00:08:35,514
Go on! Go on, get! Get!

212
00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:40,252
Really?
Now you move?

213
00:08:44,524 --> 00:08:45,490
Thanks so much!

214
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:46,591
Willy?

215
00:08:47,627 --> 00:08:48,593
Hi!

216
00:08:48,628 --> 00:08:49,761
I can't believe this.

217
00:08:49,795 --> 00:08:53,598
Oh, and I go by mina now.

218
00:08:53,633 --> 00:08:54,699
And you're...?

219
00:08:54,734 --> 00:08:55,834
Still Clay.

220
00:08:57,603 --> 00:08:58,670
No, right, yeah.

221
00:08:58,704 --> 00:09:00,505
No, I meant, and you're...
All good?

222
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:01,540
Everything...

223
00:09:01,574 --> 00:09:02,707
What are you doing here?

224
00:09:02,742 --> 00:09:03,708
What are you doing here?

225
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:05,777
I live here.

226
00:09:05,811 --> 00:09:07,712
No, right, I know, I just...

227
00:09:07,747 --> 00:09:12,350
Wasn't expecting
to run into you.

228
00:09:13,619 --> 00:09:14,686
What's that smell?

229
00:09:16,856 --> 00:09:19,324
White platinum?

230
00:09:20,726 --> 00:09:23,595
No, I think it's coming
from your shoe.

231
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:27,766
You know what, thanks for...

232
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:29,701
The cows.

233
00:09:29,735 --> 00:09:31,670
I really gotta get going.

234
00:09:31,704 --> 00:09:32,771
I've got a thing
I have to work on

235
00:09:32,805 --> 00:09:33,805
for an appointment...

236
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:35,473
Are you okay to drive?

237
00:09:35,508 --> 00:09:36,575
Yup.

238
00:09:36,609 --> 00:09:38,610
Totally fine.

239
00:09:39,612 --> 00:09:40,579
All good.

240
00:09:40,613 --> 00:09:42,180
I just really,

241
00:09:42,214 --> 00:09:43,982
really need to get into town,
so...

242
00:09:44,016 --> 00:09:46,718
Are you staying
in sycamore Springs?

243
00:09:46,752 --> 00:09:48,753
Yeah, I am, so...

244
00:09:48,788 --> 00:09:50,722
I'll just see you around town.

245
00:09:51,791 --> 00:09:53,458
I'm sure you will.

246
00:09:53,492 --> 00:09:54,593
Great.

247
00:09:54,627 --> 00:09:56,661
Great.

248
00:10:11,777 --> 00:10:13,578
Welcome home.

249
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:14,713
What?

250
00:10:14,747 --> 00:10:16,581
It's just something
we like to say.

251
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:17,649
May I get your name?

252
00:10:17,683 --> 00:10:18,650
Jones.

253
00:10:18,684 --> 00:10:20,685
Wilhelmina.

254
00:10:21,787 --> 00:10:23,555
Willy Jones?

255
00:10:23,589 --> 00:10:24,656
From high school?

256
00:10:24,690 --> 00:10:26,558
It's mina now.

257
00:10:26,592 --> 00:10:27,559
Oh, this is amazing.

258
00:10:27,593 --> 00:10:28,493
My horoscope said

259
00:10:28,527 --> 00:10:30,362
that my past was going to
catch up to me.

260
00:10:30,863 --> 00:10:32,063
I thought that meant

261
00:10:32,098 --> 00:10:34,566
that I was going to get
back together with Deacon,

262
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:35,834
my ex.

263
00:10:35,868 --> 00:10:37,736
But this is way better.

264
00:10:39,572 --> 00:10:40,605
Well, it's me, penny.

265
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:41,706
Penny laterner?

266
00:10:41,741 --> 00:10:43,642
Hi, penny.

267
00:10:43,676 --> 00:10:46,778
Yes, it's so good to see you...

268
00:10:48,147 --> 00:10:49,848
It's okay,
you don't remember me.

269
00:10:49,882 --> 00:10:51,116
I was a year behind you
in school,

270
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:54,552
and you were, well,
super popular, and I...

271
00:10:54,587 --> 00:10:55,587
Wasn't.

272
00:10:55,621 --> 00:10:56,855
I'm so sorry,

273
00:10:56,889 --> 00:10:58,690
but is there any way
I could get my room?

274
00:10:58,724 --> 00:10:59,891
Of course.

275
00:10:59,925 --> 00:11:01,393
Mm-hmm.

276
00:11:02,795 --> 00:11:04,663
Uh-oh.

277
00:11:04,697 --> 00:11:05,830
What do you mean, "uh-oh"?

278
00:11:05,865 --> 00:11:07,799
It looks like
we are overbooked.

279
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:10,802
I can't believe
I did this again.

280
00:11:10,836 --> 00:11:11,803
Well, that's okay,

281
00:11:11,837 --> 00:11:13,571
just give me whatever
room's available.

282
00:11:13,606 --> 00:11:14,806
It doesn't have to be a suite.

283
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:15,807
Well, that's the problem,

284
00:11:15,841 --> 00:11:17,075
there aren't any rooms left.

285
00:11:17,109 --> 00:11:18,677
It's a busy
time of year up here.

286
00:11:18,711 --> 00:11:19,811
Busy?

287
00:11:19,845 --> 00:11:21,646
How is that possible?

288
00:11:21,681 --> 00:11:22,881
The sweetheart festival's
this weekend?

289
00:11:22,915 --> 00:11:24,716
They still do that?

290
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:27,686
Three whole days
of fun, food and romance.

291
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:29,554
And now, there's
a really awesome dance

292
00:11:29,588 --> 00:11:30,455
on the last night.

293
00:11:30,489 --> 00:11:31,923
Are you sure there's
nothing available?

294
00:11:31,957 --> 00:11:33,558
I'm so sorry, Willy...

295
00:11:33,592 --> 00:11:34,559
Mina.

296
00:11:34,593 --> 00:11:35,560
Mina.

297
00:11:35,594 --> 00:11:36,795
I feel awful.

298
00:11:36,829 --> 00:11:38,863
Let me see
if I can get you a room

299
00:11:38,898 --> 00:11:40,665
over at the squirrel's nest inn.

300
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:41,599
Sissy owes me a favor,

301
00:11:41,634 --> 00:11:43,568
and sometimes, they can
squeeze a roll-away

302
00:11:43,602 --> 00:11:45,637
into the basement.

303
00:11:45,671 --> 00:11:46,671
On us.

304
00:11:47,673 --> 00:11:48,640
Never mind.

305
00:11:48,674 --> 00:11:49,841
I know another place

306
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:52,744
with an actual bedroom.

307
00:11:58,718 --> 00:11:59,884
Well, well.

308
00:11:59,919 --> 00:12:02,554
Look who finally showed up

309
00:12:02,588 --> 00:12:03,655
on my doorstep.

310
00:12:03,689 --> 00:12:04,689
Hi, aunt tali.

311
00:12:04,724 --> 00:12:06,658
Willy mae,
get in here right now,

312
00:12:06,692 --> 00:12:08,460
give me some sugar!

313
00:12:10,596 --> 00:12:12,597
Look at you.

314
00:12:13,766 --> 00:12:16,534
I really
appreciate this.

315
00:12:16,569 --> 00:12:17,802
I know it's
last minute.

316
00:12:17,837 --> 00:12:20,739
Oh, now, you stay
as long as you want.

317
00:12:20,773 --> 00:12:22,941
I'm just going to
make us some tea,

318
00:12:22,975 --> 00:12:25,577
build us a nice fire,

319
00:12:25,611 --> 00:12:26,878
then we can
stay up all night,

320
00:12:26,912 --> 00:12:29,781
and you can tell me
what you've been up to

321
00:12:29,815 --> 00:12:31,816
since who knows when.

322
00:12:31,851 --> 00:12:32,917
That's super sweet,
aunt tali,

323
00:12:32,952 --> 00:12:35,887
but I'm actually really tired.

324
00:12:35,921 --> 00:12:37,789
You mind if I just
call it a night?

325
00:12:37,823 --> 00:12:38,857
No, of course.

326
00:12:38,891 --> 00:12:41,159
I gotta get up early
and do some errands anyway.

327
00:12:41,193 --> 00:12:42,193
But I'm going to get you
something to eat,

328
00:12:42,228 --> 00:12:44,896
'cause you look skinnier
than a poor man's wallet.

329
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:49,134
Oh, that's okay,
I have an energy bar.

330
00:12:49,168 --> 00:12:51,903
Willy, you are in the home
of a Southern woman.

331
00:12:51,937 --> 00:12:54,839
We do not eat energy bars
for supper.

332
00:12:54,874 --> 00:12:57,776
Really, aunt tali,
I'm not even hungry.

333
00:12:57,843 --> 00:13:02,413
And actually,
I go by mina now.

334
00:13:02,448 --> 00:13:03,581
What on earth?

335
00:13:03,616 --> 00:13:04,749
Mina's just...

336
00:13:04,784 --> 00:13:06,317
More professional.

337
00:13:06,819 --> 00:13:10,421
Well, you do
whatever you need to do.

338
00:13:10,456 --> 00:13:11,689
Thank you.

339
00:13:11,724 --> 00:13:12,690
Good night...

340
00:13:12,725 --> 00:13:14,859
Nina.

341
00:13:14,894 --> 00:13:16,394
It's mina...

342
00:13:16,428 --> 00:13:17,595
With an "m."

343
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:18,596
Nope.

344
00:13:18,631 --> 00:13:21,633
It just ain't you, honey.

345
00:14:35,908 --> 00:14:38,643
Just grab a seat
anywhere, hon'.

346
00:14:51,991 --> 00:14:55,326
Can you let Mr. hart know
Ms. Jones is here?

347
00:14:55,961 --> 00:14:58,930
Oh, can I grab
one of the new menus?

348
00:14:58,964 --> 00:15:01,399
I've heard a lot about
hart's new pecan Tsunami.

349
00:15:01,433 --> 00:15:02,400
Honey,

350
00:15:02,434 --> 00:15:04,469
we only got one menu,
and you're holding it.

351
00:15:04,503 --> 00:15:05,904
And I don't know
anything

352
00:15:05,938 --> 00:15:08,439
about a pecan spumante.

353
00:15:08,474 --> 00:15:09,240
"Tsunami."

354
00:15:09,275 --> 00:15:10,775
It's the new
promotional dessert

355
00:15:10,809 --> 00:15:12,343
this month...

356
00:15:12,378 --> 00:15:13,645
Lucien!

357
00:15:13,679 --> 00:15:16,447
You ever heard of
a pecan Tsunami?

358
00:15:17,549 --> 00:15:18,716
I love that band.

359
00:15:25,457 --> 00:15:26,824
Order up!

360
00:15:26,859 --> 00:15:28,693
Thank you.

361
00:15:34,733 --> 00:15:35,700
Sure I can't
get you anything

362
00:15:35,734 --> 00:15:36,734
while you wait?

363
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:37,835
Lucien makes a mean
chicken and waffles.

364
00:15:37,870 --> 00:15:39,671
Trust me,

365
00:15:39,705 --> 00:15:40,872
these birds are
as fresh as you can get.

366
00:15:40,906 --> 00:15:43,441
Free-range from leanne's farm
across the highway.

367
00:15:43,475 --> 00:15:44,375
No, thank you,

368
00:15:44,410 --> 00:15:46,177
but could you check
with Mr. hart again?

369
00:15:46,211 --> 00:15:48,680
Well, he always comes in
a little late on Tuesday.

370
00:15:48,714 --> 00:15:49,681
Why is that?

371
00:15:49,715 --> 00:15:50,682
Trout Tuesday.

372
00:15:50,716 --> 00:15:51,983
Let's hope
those fish are biting,

373
00:15:52,017 --> 00:15:53,785
otherwise he's gonna be
in a mood.

374
00:15:53,819 --> 00:15:55,887
Good catch
today, Gracie!

375
00:15:55,921 --> 00:15:56,888
Trout Tuesday
is a go.

376
00:15:56,922 --> 00:15:58,656
Oh, glad to hear it.

377
00:15:58,691 --> 00:15:59,724
Let me have a look.

378
00:16:00,759 --> 00:16:02,260
Wow. Nice catch.

379
00:16:02,861 --> 00:16:05,496
You've got
company here.

380
00:16:08,701 --> 00:16:09,767
Well...

381
00:16:09,802 --> 00:16:11,502
You're everywhere I go.

382
00:16:11,537 --> 00:16:12,637
Should I be worried?

383
00:16:12,671 --> 00:16:15,773
Is this some kind of weird
ex-girlfriend stalking thing?

384
00:16:15,808 --> 00:16:16,774
I am not stalking you.

385
00:16:16,809 --> 00:16:18,343
I'm kidding.

386
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:20,011
I'm looking for your dad.

387
00:16:20,045 --> 00:16:22,513
I've emailed him
about a thousand times

388
00:16:22,548 --> 00:16:23,681
and I have not...

389
00:16:23,716 --> 00:16:26,351
My dad?

390
00:16:26,385 --> 00:16:27,518
Yeah.

391
00:16:27,553 --> 00:16:30,288
Any idea how much longer
he's going to keep ignoring me?

392
00:16:30,923 --> 00:16:33,791
I'd say it's gonna be a while.

393
00:16:33,826 --> 00:16:36,327
Why?

394
00:16:37,529 --> 00:16:40,565
Unfortunately, my dad...

395
00:16:40,599 --> 00:16:43,501
Passed away three months ago.

396
00:16:43,535 --> 00:16:44,869
Oh.

397
00:16:44,937 --> 00:16:46,404
I'm so sorry.

398
00:16:46,438 --> 00:16:48,373
I had no idea.

399
00:16:50,542 --> 00:16:53,344
So, who's running hart's?

400
00:16:54,513 --> 00:16:56,547
You're looking at him.

401
00:17:01,053 --> 00:17:02,954
Is no one reading
the company emails

402
00:17:02,988 --> 00:17:05,690
or checking
voice messages?

403
00:17:05,724 --> 00:17:07,058
I'm more of an old-school
fax kinda guy.

404
00:17:07,092 --> 00:17:10,428
But, no, I haven't received
a phone call from you

405
00:17:10,462 --> 00:17:11,662
in, I don't know...

406
00:17:11,697 --> 00:17:13,664
15 years?

407
00:17:13,699 --> 00:17:14,732
What do you want now?

408
00:17:14,767 --> 00:17:16,734
Well, as you know,

409
00:17:16,769 --> 00:17:17,935
hart's was recently purchased

410
00:17:17,970 --> 00:17:20,838
by international
corporate brands and...

411
00:17:20,873 --> 00:17:22,006
I'm not sure if I agree
with that decision,

412
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:25,443
but nothing I can do
about it now, right?

413
00:17:25,477 --> 00:17:27,278
And I work for icb.

414
00:17:27,946 --> 00:17:29,013
They sent me here
to make sure you...

415
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:33,484
To talk you through
some re-branding changes.

416
00:17:33,519 --> 00:17:34,952
Well, what do you know,

417
00:17:34,987 --> 00:17:37,522
little Willy mae
is now a big wig,

418
00:17:37,556 --> 00:17:39,057
sent back here to help me.

419
00:17:39,091 --> 00:17:40,992
I don't like it
any more than you do.

420
00:17:41,026 --> 00:17:43,795
But we really need
to talk about...

421
00:17:43,829 --> 00:17:45,797
You know, it was
lovely seeing you.

422
00:17:45,831 --> 00:17:47,832
Now, if you'll excuse me,

423
00:17:47,866 --> 00:17:50,301
I've got some fish to clean.

424
00:17:53,939 --> 00:17:55,473
<i>How did we not know this?</i>

425
00:17:55,507 --> 00:17:56,607
I don't know.

426
00:17:56,642 --> 00:17:58,543
Isn't there some paperwork
he should have filled out

427
00:17:58,577 --> 00:17:59,544
or something?

428
00:17:59,578 --> 00:18:01,846
We're not dealing with
a paperwork kind of guy.

429
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:03,481
So, get me the contract details

430
00:18:03,515 --> 00:18:04,482
<i>asap.</i>

431
00:18:04,516 --> 00:18:05,550
<i>And have marketing</i>
<i>send me posters,</i>

432
00:18:05,584 --> 00:18:06,551
menus,

433
00:18:06,585 --> 00:18:07,919
everything.

434
00:18:07,953 --> 00:18:09,554
This is more than complicated,

435
00:18:09,588 --> 00:18:11,322
it's a disaster.

436
00:18:11,356 --> 00:18:12,790
Mina!

437
00:18:12,825 --> 00:18:14,392
Uh-oh. Gotta go.

438
00:18:14,426 --> 00:18:15,460
Call you later.

439
00:18:18,497 --> 00:18:19,564
Oh!

440
00:18:19,598 --> 00:18:21,432
Willy Jones?

441
00:18:21,467 --> 00:18:22,934
Hi, paisley.

442
00:18:22,968 --> 00:18:25,736
What are you doing back
in sycamore Springs?

443
00:18:25,771 --> 00:18:27,772
Are you here to open a bank,
or men's clothing store,

444
00:18:27,806 --> 00:18:28,806
or something?

445
00:18:28,841 --> 00:18:30,441
Ha, no.

446
00:18:30,476 --> 00:18:31,709
And, actually,

447
00:18:31,743 --> 00:18:33,711
it's not Willy anymore,
it's mina.

448
00:18:33,745 --> 00:18:34,846
Well...

449
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:37,915
Good to know.

450
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:38,916
Yeah, the corporation
I work for

451
00:18:38,951 --> 00:18:41,519
just bought the hart's chain,
so I'm here to...

452
00:18:41,553 --> 00:18:42,787
You're here to see Clay?

453
00:18:42,821 --> 00:18:44,889
Well, not intentionally...

454
00:18:44,923 --> 00:18:46,858
And what crazy timing.

455
00:18:46,892 --> 00:18:48,793
What? What do you mean?

456
00:18:48,827 --> 00:18:50,027
I mean,
it's so weird

457
00:18:50,062 --> 00:18:52,797
that you just show up,
out of the blue,

458
00:18:52,831 --> 00:18:53,831
now that Clay and I are dating.

459
00:18:53,866 --> 00:18:56,934
Wow, I didn't know
that you two were...

460
00:18:56,969 --> 00:18:58,836
Yeah, well, we will definitely
have to get together

461
00:18:58,871 --> 00:19:00,104
while you're in town,

462
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:02,640
and you can tell me all about
your glamorous big city life.

463
00:19:03,876 --> 00:19:04,842
There you are.

464
00:19:04,877 --> 00:19:06,777
I've been looking
all over for you.

465
00:19:06,812 --> 00:19:08,379
Oh, afternoon,
tallulah.

466
00:19:08,413 --> 00:19:09,514
Paisley.

467
00:19:09,548 --> 00:19:10,815
Is that a new hat?

468
00:19:10,849 --> 00:19:12,617
It is so...

469
00:19:12,651 --> 00:19:13,818
Interesting.

470
00:19:15,454 --> 00:19:16,454
Well, thank you.

471
00:19:16,488 --> 00:19:17,755
It is a new hat.

472
00:19:17,789 --> 00:19:18,923
You know, we'd love
to stay and chat,

473
00:19:18,957 --> 00:19:20,725
but we've got to
get going.

474
00:19:20,759 --> 00:19:22,326
Love your dress.

475
00:19:25,898 --> 00:19:27,798
I never liked
that girl,

476
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:29,500
or that dress.

477
00:19:29,535 --> 00:19:30,601
Thank you.

478
00:19:30,636 --> 00:19:32,970
Now, how come
you didn't tell me

479
00:19:33,005 --> 00:19:35,640
that you came here
to take over hart's?

480
00:19:35,674 --> 00:19:37,642
This is a small
town, Willy mae.

481
00:19:37,676 --> 00:19:39,043
I have spies everywhere,

482
00:19:39,077 --> 00:19:42,547
and people here do not
take kindly to change.

483
00:19:42,581 --> 00:19:45,449
Well, things
have changed,

484
00:19:45,484 --> 00:19:46,617
including my name,

485
00:19:46,652 --> 00:19:50,555
which again,
is mina, not Willy.

486
00:19:50,589 --> 00:19:53,457
Yeah, well,
it just doesn't...

487
00:19:53,492 --> 00:19:54,992
Roll off the tongue.

488
00:19:55,027 --> 00:19:57,528
It will with
a little practice.

489
00:20:05,504 --> 00:20:06,470
Hello?

490
00:20:06,505 --> 00:20:07,972
Hey.

491
00:20:08,006 --> 00:20:09,540
Where is everyone?

492
00:20:09,575 --> 00:20:11,509
I'm closing early.

493
00:20:12,711 --> 00:20:14,011
Got a town council meeting
in here tonight,

494
00:20:14,046 --> 00:20:17,481
and I'm off to coach
the youth basketball team.

495
00:20:17,516 --> 00:20:18,382
But...

496
00:20:18,417 --> 00:20:19,984
You can't just do
all this other stuff.

497
00:20:20,018 --> 00:20:22,920
The restaurant needs
your undivided attention.

498
00:20:22,955 --> 00:20:23,921
You know,
I'm sick of you telling me

499
00:20:23,956 --> 00:20:26,123
what I can and can't do
in my restaurant.

500
00:20:26,158 --> 00:20:27,825
That's what I've been
trying to tell you.

501
00:20:27,859 --> 00:20:29,827
It's not
your restaurant anymore.

502
00:20:29,861 --> 00:20:31,829
The deal your dad made

503
00:20:31,863 --> 00:20:34,599
requires you to comply with
any and all changes

504
00:20:34,633 --> 00:20:36,634
icb deems necessary.

505
00:20:38,704 --> 00:20:40,004
What?

506
00:20:40,038 --> 00:20:42,039
They own
and operate hart's now,

507
00:20:42,074 --> 00:20:44,942
and they can do whatever
they want with the chain.

508
00:20:44,977 --> 00:20:47,411
The look, the menu,
everything.

509
00:20:47,446 --> 00:20:48,246
I'm sorry,

510
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:50,915
but you don't
have a choice, Clay.

511
00:20:50,949 --> 00:20:53,551
And if you don't comply
with the rebranding,

512
00:20:53,585 --> 00:20:56,587
they will get rid of you.

513
00:21:04,763 --> 00:21:06,564
Hey, man.

514
00:21:06,598 --> 00:21:08,065
Hey, buddy!

515
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:09,800
Can I get
a whiskey?

516
00:21:09,835 --> 00:21:13,037
You know what,
make it a double.

517
00:21:13,071 --> 00:21:15,506
I take it you heard
Willy's back?

518
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:16,741
Oh, yeah.

519
00:21:16,775 --> 00:21:18,075
I heard.

520
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:21,012
Paisley's not gonna be
too happy about that.

521
00:21:21,046 --> 00:21:22,647
What are you talking about?

522
00:21:22,681 --> 00:21:24,782
We broke up last week.

523
00:21:24,816 --> 00:21:26,584
Well, thanks for telling me.

524
00:21:26,618 --> 00:21:27,685
You know, Clay,

525
00:21:27,719 --> 00:21:29,020
it's not good

526
00:21:29,054 --> 00:21:31,822
to hold all those strong
emotions stuck inside.

527
00:21:31,857 --> 00:21:33,924
What are you doing?

528
00:21:33,959 --> 00:21:35,993
I'm helping you process.

529
00:21:36,028 --> 00:21:38,562
You know, it's the whole
empathetic bartender thing.

530
00:21:38,597 --> 00:21:39,497
The deal was

531
00:21:39,531 --> 00:21:40,731
that you were
supposed to be my partner,

532
00:21:40,766 --> 00:21:42,500
not my therapist.

533
00:21:42,534 --> 00:21:43,000
Right,

534
00:21:43,035 --> 00:21:44,135
which reminds me,

535
00:21:44,169 --> 00:21:46,203
that, as the new co-owner
of this fine establishment,

536
00:21:46,238 --> 00:21:50,074
you get to choose a drink
named after yourself.

537
00:21:50,108 --> 00:21:52,610
Deacon, this is serious.

538
00:21:53,211 --> 00:21:54,245
She's going to
take away my restaurant.

539
00:21:54,279 --> 00:21:57,682
Willy works for the company
that bought hart's.

540
00:21:57,749 --> 00:21:59,517
She was sent here to change...

541
00:21:59,551 --> 00:22:00,685
Everything.

542
00:22:00,719 --> 00:22:03,321
What are you talking about?

543
00:22:03,355 --> 00:22:05,990
She's gonna turn it into
one of those generic diners,

544
00:22:06,024 --> 00:22:07,158
like Grayson's.

545
00:22:07,192 --> 00:22:11,595
But hart's has been
in your family for 50 years.

546
00:22:12,831 --> 00:22:14,532
What am I going to do?

547
00:22:15,767 --> 00:22:17,768
Well, you

548
00:22:17,803 --> 00:22:20,671
and this claytini...

549
00:22:21,673 --> 00:22:23,808
Will figure something out.

550
00:22:33,719 --> 00:22:34,985
<i>Hey, how's it going?</i>

551
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:36,687
You have no idea
how happy I am

552
00:22:36,722 --> 00:22:37,955
to hear your voice.

553
00:22:37,989 --> 00:22:40,825
Well, you have no idea
how desperately I miss you.

554
00:22:40,859 --> 00:22:43,027
What are you doing tonight?

555
00:22:43,061 --> 00:22:45,062
Well, first,
I'm schmoozing clients,

556
00:22:45,097 --> 00:22:46,063
followed by crossfit at 9:00,

557
00:22:46,098 --> 00:22:47,231
and then Chloe and kenline

558
00:22:47,265 --> 00:22:49,100
are taking me
to some after-hours lounge

559
00:22:49,134 --> 00:22:50,801
<i>in the back of a butcher shop.</i>

560
00:22:50,836 --> 00:22:52,636
I miss my life in the city.

561
00:22:52,671 --> 00:22:53,771
Aw...

562
00:22:53,805 --> 00:22:54,772
How's it going?

563
00:22:54,806 --> 00:22:55,773
I texted you, but...

564
00:22:55,841 --> 00:22:56,774
I know,

565
00:22:56,808 --> 00:22:58,943
sorry.
It's been a rough day.

566
00:22:58,977 --> 00:23:00,745
Well, how does it feel
to be back?

567
00:23:00,779 --> 00:23:03,748
Like a high-school reunion
from hell.

568
00:23:03,782 --> 00:23:05,583
Oh, it can't be that bad.

569
00:23:05,617 --> 00:23:08,185
Let's see, no hotel room,

570
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:10,788
<i>forced to stay</i>
<i>with my artsy aunt.</i>

571
00:23:10,822 --> 00:23:12,123
Ran into
my high-school Nemesis,

572
00:23:12,157 --> 00:23:15,559
<i>and the owner of hart's</i>
<i>died three months ago.</i>

573
00:23:15,594 --> 00:23:17,795
So, pretty bad.

574
00:23:17,829 --> 00:23:19,830
I'm sure you'll get it
all smoothed out.

575
00:23:19,865 --> 00:23:21,799
They don't call you
"the fixer" for nothing.

576
00:23:21,833 --> 00:23:23,033
People call me that?

577
00:23:23,068 --> 00:23:25,035
They will
after you nail this job.

578
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:28,005
I just want to finish
and come home.

579
00:23:28,039 --> 00:23:30,741
Home to a condo
with a steam room

580
00:23:30,776 --> 00:23:31,842
and a clawfoot tub.

581
00:23:31,877 --> 00:23:33,043
Mm...

582
00:23:33,078 --> 00:23:35,746
A hot bath does sound nice.

583
00:23:35,781 --> 00:23:37,782
Oh, gotta go,
clients are coming.

584
00:23:37,816 --> 00:23:39,717
Keep thinking about it, okay?

585
00:23:40,719 --> 00:23:41,852
Bye.

586
00:23:49,327 --> 00:23:53,097
Well, I think we've waited
for him long enough,

587
00:23:53,131 --> 00:23:54,198
so why don't we just
get started.

588
00:23:54,232 --> 00:23:56,801
We think hart's
has become synonymous

589
00:23:56,835 --> 00:23:58,636
with all things American.

590
00:23:58,670 --> 00:23:59,870
Hence,

591
00:23:59,905 --> 00:24:02,673
our re-branding starts with
the "americana extreme" menu.

592
00:24:04,576 --> 00:24:05,643
Americana extreme?

593
00:24:05,677 --> 00:24:08,512
It's a twist on everyone's
favorite comfort foods,

594
00:24:08,547 --> 00:24:09,013
hamburgers,

595
00:24:09,047 --> 00:24:11,682
hot dogs, chicken,

596
00:24:11,716 --> 00:24:12,817
barbecue ribs.

597
00:24:12,851 --> 00:24:15,519
All of which our vendors
are set up to provide.

598
00:24:15,554 --> 00:24:17,021
What's the twist?

599
00:24:17,055 --> 00:24:19,824
It's not actual food.

600
00:24:19,858 --> 00:24:20,991
Why don't we just watch
the presentation,

601
00:24:21,026 --> 00:24:22,693
and I'll take questions
after, okay?

602
00:24:22,727 --> 00:24:23,727
Thanks.

603
00:24:24,896 --> 00:24:26,831
International
corporate brands

604
00:24:26,865 --> 00:24:28,065
is a global
brand management firm

605
00:24:28,099 --> 00:24:31,669
that oversees
50 businesses worldwide...

606
00:24:34,673 --> 00:24:36,841
You always
used to come here

607
00:24:36,875 --> 00:24:39,510
when you were
avoiding something,

608
00:24:39,544 --> 00:24:41,812
or someone.

609
00:24:41,847 --> 00:24:42,847
Yeah, well, now

610
00:24:42,881 --> 00:24:45,115
I'm just trying to get
a catch of the day.

611
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:47,852
And as admirable
as that is,

612
00:24:47,886 --> 00:24:49,220
I don't think corporate
would appreciate

613
00:24:49,254 --> 00:24:52,923
you undermining their
commercial fishing suppliers.

614
00:24:52,958 --> 00:24:55,059
I can't believe
you discovered my plot

615
00:24:55,093 --> 00:24:57,695
to destroy
the world economy.

616
00:24:58,897 --> 00:25:00,631
I need you to come back
to the restaurant

617
00:25:00,665 --> 00:25:02,733
and help motivate
the employees.

618
00:25:02,767 --> 00:25:05,603
I need you to be
the manager.

619
00:25:05,637 --> 00:25:07,905
So, now you need my help?

620
00:25:07,939 --> 00:25:10,040
We want you to stay
and run the restaurant.

621
00:25:10,075 --> 00:25:11,909
It's best for everyone.

622
00:25:11,943 --> 00:25:13,744
Okay.

623
00:25:13,778 --> 00:25:14,778
We'll just keep things

624
00:25:14,813 --> 00:25:18,048
the way they are then.

625
00:25:18,083 --> 00:25:20,618
I don't know how you thought
this would play out,

626
00:25:20,652 --> 00:25:21,785
or what your dad told you,

627
00:25:21,820 --> 00:25:24,655
but this is what happens
in a takeover.

628
00:25:24,689 --> 00:25:25,689
Changes are made.

629
00:25:25,724 --> 00:25:26,724
And besides,

630
00:25:26,758 --> 00:25:28,659
the other stores have
already started re-branding.

631
00:25:28,693 --> 00:25:29,760
Charlotte, Knoxville...

632
00:25:29,794 --> 00:25:30,761
You know what,

633
00:25:30,795 --> 00:25:32,830
I might not
be able to stop them

634
00:25:32,864 --> 00:25:35,099
from destroying
the other five restaurants,

635
00:25:35,133 --> 00:25:39,703
but I can sure do something
about this one.

636
00:25:44,609 --> 00:25:47,211
A property deed?

637
00:25:47,245 --> 00:25:48,779
I inherited
the sycamore Springs restaurant

638
00:25:48,813 --> 00:25:50,047
when my dad passed away.

639
00:25:50,081 --> 00:25:53,484
The title to the restaurant
is in my name.

640
00:25:54,786 --> 00:25:55,753
What?

641
00:25:55,787 --> 00:25:57,888
Icb may own
the name hart's,

642
00:25:57,923 --> 00:26:00,257
but the restaurant is mine.

643
00:26:00,292 --> 00:26:04,728
I'm not sure your father
was authorized to do that.

644
00:26:04,763 --> 00:26:07,364
Yeah, maybe, maybe not.

645
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:09,767
But if icb
wants to fight me on it,

646
00:26:09,801 --> 00:26:10,801
I'll see them in court.

647
00:26:10,835 --> 00:26:12,069
I've seen the numbers.
You're in the red,

648
00:26:12,103 --> 00:26:14,738
no matter whose name
is on the deed.

649
00:26:14,773 --> 00:26:16,640
We'll make it up in the summer.

650
00:26:16,675 --> 00:26:17,942
No, you won't.

651
00:26:17,976 --> 00:26:21,579
All this local, organic
produce is perishable.

652
00:26:21,613 --> 00:26:22,880
Using our vendors

653
00:26:22,914 --> 00:26:24,281
will cut your
costs in half.

654
00:26:24,316 --> 00:26:27,618
And with our marketing,
you'll get more tourists.

655
00:26:27,652 --> 00:26:28,385
It'll boost business

656
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:29,753
for everyone
in sycamore Springs.

657
00:26:29,788 --> 00:26:30,754
Since when did you care

658
00:26:30,789 --> 00:26:32,122
about sycamore Springs?

659
00:26:32,157 --> 00:26:33,757
You left and never looked back.

660
00:26:33,792 --> 00:26:34,892
I know, but that's me.

661
00:26:34,926 --> 00:26:35,926
Not you.

662
00:26:35,961 --> 00:26:37,861
You're established
in this community.

663
00:26:37,896 --> 00:26:39,029
So, let me
get this straight.

664
00:26:39,064 --> 00:26:42,566
You want to turn a small,
farm-to-table family business

665
00:26:42,601 --> 00:26:44,134
into a factory?

666
00:26:44,169 --> 00:26:46,937
A factory that serves
pre-packaged, frozen food

667
00:26:46,972 --> 00:26:48,839
disguised as old-fashioned
home cooking?

668
00:26:48,873 --> 00:26:50,608
It's americana extreme.

669
00:26:50,642 --> 00:26:51,609
It's wrong.

670
00:26:51,643 --> 00:26:52,676
It's profitable.

671
00:26:52,711 --> 00:26:54,111
What's wrong with you?

672
00:26:54,145 --> 00:26:57,648
I'm not the enemy here, Clay,

673
00:26:57,682 --> 00:26:58,816
I'm here to help.

674
00:26:58,850 --> 00:27:01,652
And if you don't
do something,

675
00:27:01,686 --> 00:27:03,587
you'll be out of business
in months,

676
00:27:03,622 --> 00:27:05,356
no matter what.

677
00:27:10,362 --> 00:27:13,564
You know, this is state history
you want to get

678
00:27:13,598 --> 00:27:15,099
it's a small-town ritual.

679
00:27:15,133 --> 00:27:17,334
It's a ritual we take
very seriously.

680
00:27:17,936 --> 00:27:19,737
I guess that explains

681
00:27:19,771 --> 00:27:21,705
why you had to cheat
and use a horse to win

682
00:27:21,740 --> 00:27:22,940
that year?

683
00:27:22,974 --> 00:27:25,676
The rules state you can use
any means necessary

684
00:27:25,710 --> 00:27:26,677
to get across the finish line.

685
00:27:26,711 --> 00:27:27,811
Yeah.

686
00:27:27,846 --> 00:27:29,647
Wait a minute...

687
00:27:30,782 --> 00:27:32,716
Are you still upset
that I won that year?

688
00:27:32,751 --> 00:27:33,851
Don't be ridiculous.

689
00:27:33,885 --> 00:27:35,919
Just take them down.

690
00:27:35,954 --> 00:27:38,822
We can't have personal items
cluttering up the display area.

691
00:27:38,857 --> 00:27:39,857
"We can't have

692
00:27:39,891 --> 00:27:42,660
"personal items
cluttering up the display area."

693
00:27:44,896 --> 00:27:46,296
What's wrong with
the microwave?

694
00:27:46,331 --> 00:27:49,800
You mean besides using it
to warm up pre-cooked food?

695
00:27:50,802 --> 00:27:52,870
One maisie-burger.

696
00:27:52,904 --> 00:27:53,971
Whoa, whoa.
What's a maisieburger?

697
00:27:54,005 --> 00:27:57,174
It's a rare hamburger
with Swiss cheese,

698
00:27:57,208 --> 00:27:59,710
heirloom tomatoes,
avocado, and fresh basil.

699
00:28:01,012 --> 00:28:03,480
Okay, well there are so many
things wrong with this picture.

700
00:28:03,515 --> 00:28:05,616
First of all,

701
00:28:05,650 --> 00:28:06,850
there's no
ordering "off menu,"

702
00:28:06,885 --> 00:28:07,985
it takes extra time
to prepare.

703
00:28:08,019 --> 00:28:10,854
Second,
per corporate regulations,

704
00:28:10,889 --> 00:28:12,923
all meat must be cooked
medium well.

705
00:28:12,957 --> 00:28:14,858
Oh, you've got to be
kidding me?

706
00:28:14,893 --> 00:28:16,727
You might as well suck all
the flavor out of the beef.

707
00:28:16,761 --> 00:28:18,629
I'm not cooking up
hockey pucks.

708
00:28:18,663 --> 00:28:19,930
That's what she always orders.

709
00:28:19,964 --> 00:28:20,931
Then politely tell her

710
00:28:20,965 --> 00:28:22,933
we're unable to accommodate
her request,

711
00:28:22,967 --> 00:28:26,170
and ask if she'd like
the super-slam cheeseburger

712
00:28:26,204 --> 00:28:28,639
with good, old American cheese
and pickles.

713
00:28:31,876 --> 00:28:32,910
I told you, you can't use
your own produce.

714
00:28:32,944 --> 00:28:34,812
We have
corporate-approved vendors.

715
00:28:34,846 --> 00:28:35,846
Your vendors are awful.

716
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:37,781
I've seen those
frozen sticks you call fries.

717
00:28:37,816 --> 00:28:39,750
Bulk produce will
save you significantly.

718
00:28:39,784 --> 00:28:40,918
Besides, you'll soon see

719
00:28:40,952 --> 00:28:42,886
most customers can't even
tell the difference.

720
00:28:42,921 --> 00:28:44,855
That's insane.

721
00:28:44,889 --> 00:28:46,757
Here, try this.

722
00:28:46,791 --> 00:28:47,958
Tell me you can't
notice a difference.

723
00:28:47,992 --> 00:28:49,660
That's really
not necessary.

724
00:28:50,962 --> 00:28:52,896
How can you work for a company
that manages restaurants

725
00:28:52,931 --> 00:28:54,865
and not care about the food?

726
00:28:54,899 --> 00:28:56,834
I'm a brand manager,
not a food manager.

727
00:28:56,868 --> 00:29:00,738
Well, my customers
can tell the difference.

728
00:29:00,772 --> 00:29:01,872
Take a bite.

729
00:29:01,906 --> 00:29:04,007
You've obviously forgotten
what fresh fruit tastes like.

730
00:29:04,042 --> 00:29:05,776
Then can we get
back to work inside?

731
00:29:10,415 --> 00:29:11,648
Mm.

732
00:29:11,683 --> 00:29:12,683
That's good.

733
00:29:13,685 --> 00:29:14,818
But all apples taste the same.

734
00:29:14,853 --> 00:29:16,153
Oh, come on.

735
00:29:16,187 --> 00:29:18,789
Tell "executive" Willy
to take the day off.

736
00:29:20,892 --> 00:29:21,859
Close your eyes,

737
00:29:21,893 --> 00:29:24,828
and actually
experience it.

738
00:29:24,863 --> 00:29:25,896
Close my eyes?

739
00:29:25,930 --> 00:29:28,866
That's ridiculous.

740
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:31,435
Well, I can stay here all day.

741
00:29:32,036 --> 00:29:33,837
Fine.

742
00:29:43,882 --> 00:29:47,718
It's sweet...

743
00:29:47,752 --> 00:29:49,720
And crisp.

744
00:29:49,754 --> 00:29:50,921
Not just the taste.

745
00:29:50,955 --> 00:29:53,957
How does it make you feel?

746
00:29:53,992 --> 00:29:57,361
What does it remind you of?

747
00:29:57,929 --> 00:29:59,863
I don't know,

748
00:29:59,898 --> 00:30:01,231
being a kid,

749
00:30:01,266 --> 00:30:03,467
walking home from school,
through the wildflowers,

750
00:30:03,501 --> 00:30:04,501
down by...

751
00:30:04,536 --> 00:30:05,536
The river?

752
00:30:07,105 --> 00:30:09,907
We used to steal them
from Mr. mcclane's yard.

753
00:30:09,941 --> 00:30:12,476
Correction,
you used to steal them.

754
00:30:13,111 --> 00:30:16,013
I was just
your lookout.

755
00:30:16,047 --> 00:30:17,948
Maisie's leaving!

756
00:30:17,982 --> 00:30:20,851
Maybe we should have offered her
the chili cheese wings instead.

757
00:30:20,885 --> 00:30:23,420
I'll be there
in a minute.

758
00:30:26,825 --> 00:30:30,060
Maisie...
Maisie, wait...

759
00:30:30,094 --> 00:30:32,796
Oh, Clay,
you know I love you.

760
00:30:32,831 --> 00:30:33,897
We all do.

761
00:30:33,932 --> 00:30:37,034
And we'd do anything
for you and hart's.

762
00:30:37,068 --> 00:30:39,870
Thank you very much.

763
00:30:39,904 --> 00:30:41,305
But your father would be
rolling in his grave

764
00:30:41,339 --> 00:30:45,008
if he saw what you and that girl
are doing to this place.

765
00:30:45,043 --> 00:30:47,978
There's only so much change
people are willing to take,

766
00:30:48,012 --> 00:30:53,483
and then they'll just
stop coming around altogether.

767
00:30:53,518 --> 00:30:54,885
Okay?

768
00:31:04,896 --> 00:31:07,764
Look what just arrived.

769
00:31:07,799 --> 00:31:08,765
My dignity?

770
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:10,934
New uniforms.

771
00:31:10,969 --> 00:31:11,935
You've got to be kidding.

772
00:31:11,970 --> 00:31:13,804
I even got name tags.

773
00:31:13,838 --> 00:31:14,938
Great.

774
00:31:14,973 --> 00:31:16,907
Now everyone in town
will know my name.

775
00:31:16,941 --> 00:31:18,809
Funny.

776
00:31:18,843 --> 00:31:20,110
Now, let's make sure

777
00:31:20,144 --> 00:31:21,778
everyone wears these
to work tomorrow.

778
00:31:21,813 --> 00:31:22,779
Oh, we'll be closed.

779
00:31:22,814 --> 00:31:23,847
What?

780
00:31:23,882 --> 00:31:25,082
No one told me that.

781
00:31:25,116 --> 00:31:26,850
The sweetheart festival
starts tomorrow.

782
00:31:26,885 --> 00:31:28,852
Yeah, we sponsor
the opening day.

783
00:31:28,887 --> 00:31:31,021
Lucien will be up
all night prepping.

784
00:31:31,055 --> 00:31:32,956
But I haven't seen a menu.

785
00:31:32,991 --> 00:31:36,727
I'm thinking warm
pulled pork sandwiches

786
00:31:36,761 --> 00:31:37,761
with sweet potatoes and thyme.

787
00:31:37,795 --> 00:31:38,762
What do you say, boss?

788
00:31:38,796 --> 00:31:41,031
Oh, yeah, that sound
like perfect festival food.

789
00:31:41,065 --> 00:31:43,500
Absolutely not.

790
00:31:44,102 --> 00:31:45,068
We still
have to represent

791
00:31:45,103 --> 00:31:46,069
the new hart's brand,

792
00:31:46,104 --> 00:31:47,971
even if we cater
outside the restaurant.

793
00:31:48,006 --> 00:31:49,940
Hold on, now,
if you're telling me

794
00:31:49,974 --> 00:31:51,541
we can't sponsor
the festival,

795
00:31:51,576 --> 00:31:52,643
then I'm sorry...

796
00:31:52,677 --> 00:31:53,911
No, in fact,

797
00:31:53,945 --> 00:31:56,847
we'll up our presence.

798
00:31:56,881 --> 00:31:58,115
We'll use the festival
as a platform

799
00:31:58,149 --> 00:32:01,818
to promote
the new corporate menu.

800
00:32:01,853 --> 00:32:03,720
I think that's
a really bad idea.

801
00:32:03,755 --> 00:32:04,721
Trust me,

802
00:32:04,756 --> 00:32:06,023
this is what I do.

803
00:32:06,057 --> 00:32:07,991
Trick people into
eating bad food?

804
00:32:08,026 --> 00:32:13,530
Get people to see an old brand
in a new light.

805
00:32:16,801 --> 00:32:18,568
Would you like to try?

806
00:32:18,603 --> 00:32:20,604
Here you go. Enjoy.

807
00:32:20,638 --> 00:32:21,438
For you?

808
00:32:21,472 --> 00:32:23,607
Some good old-fashioned
home-cooking.

809
00:32:24,976 --> 00:32:25,976
Well, I never thought
I'd say this,

810
00:32:26,010 --> 00:32:28,045
but thank goodness
for all those preservatives.

811
00:32:28,079 --> 00:32:31,949
Whatever we don't use this year
we can always use next year

812
00:32:31,983 --> 00:32:34,584
and the year after that.

813
00:32:34,619 --> 00:32:35,852
If I remember correctly,

814
00:32:35,887 --> 00:32:36,987
your sarcasm was
one of the reasons

815
00:32:37,021 --> 00:32:38,121
we broke up
in the first place.

816
00:32:38,156 --> 00:32:39,856
Oh, you didn't actually
break up with me.

817
00:32:39,891 --> 00:32:41,158
You just left.

818
00:32:41,192 --> 00:32:42,759
Can we pretend
to get along

819
00:32:42,794 --> 00:32:43,961
for publicity purposes?

820
00:32:43,995 --> 00:32:45,462
Fine.

821
00:32:45,496 --> 00:32:46,263
Great.

822
00:32:46,297 --> 00:32:47,064
Everything set up
for the race?

823
00:32:47,098 --> 00:32:48,799
Yeah, there's a new
hart's menu item

824
00:32:48,833 --> 00:32:49,800
at every station.

825
00:32:49,834 --> 00:32:50,901
Let's just hope
we don't kill someone

826
00:32:50,935 --> 00:32:52,135
before they reach
the finish line.

827
00:32:52,170 --> 00:32:54,938
R&D says over 80%
of our customers

828
00:32:54,973 --> 00:32:56,673
are satisfied
with this menu.

829
00:32:57,675 --> 00:32:59,476
You're satisfied
with this?

830
00:32:59,510 --> 00:33:00,944
Hi, guys.

831
00:33:00,979 --> 00:33:02,612
Wow, this looks beautiful.

832
00:33:02,647 --> 00:33:03,613
Just one

833
00:33:03,648 --> 00:33:05,916
of the many new changes
happening at hart's.

834
00:33:05,950 --> 00:33:07,818
Here, try
a chicken dipper

835
00:33:07,852 --> 00:33:09,820
with our new tangy
barbecue sauce.

836
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:17,861
Mm, yeah, that's...

837
00:33:17,895 --> 00:33:18,895
Really good.

838
00:33:18,930 --> 00:33:21,431
My compliments
to the chemist.

839
00:33:22,066 --> 00:33:23,233
So, are y'all ready

840
00:33:23,267 --> 00:33:25,535
to defend your title in
the great stuff-your-face race?

841
00:33:25,570 --> 00:33:26,837
Absolutely.

842
00:33:26,871 --> 00:33:27,871
Are you entering?

843
00:33:27,905 --> 00:33:29,906
What? Me? No.

844
00:33:29,941 --> 00:33:31,842
Oh, she's just upset that
I beat her in high school.

845
00:33:31,876 --> 00:33:33,377
No, I'm not upset.

846
00:33:34,045 --> 00:33:35,178
And I'm not racing.

847
00:33:35,213 --> 00:33:36,947
Good day, fine people
of Tennessee.

848
00:33:36,981 --> 00:33:37,948
And penny.

849
00:33:37,982 --> 00:33:39,549
He's still
not over me.

850
00:33:39,584 --> 00:33:40,584
Bless his heart.

851
00:33:41,719 --> 00:33:42,853
So, the rumors are true.

852
00:33:42,887 --> 00:33:43,854
Hi, Deacon.

853
00:33:43,888 --> 00:33:45,188
And yes, I really am back.

854
00:33:45,223 --> 00:33:47,858
Well, it sure is great
to see you again, Ms. Willy.

855
00:33:47,892 --> 00:33:48,892
It's mina.

856
00:33:48,926 --> 00:33:49,893
Oh, yeah?

857
00:33:49,927 --> 00:33:51,595
Well, I like it.

858
00:33:51,629 --> 00:33:53,797
It's very chic.

859
00:33:53,831 --> 00:33:55,565
It really fits
your new aesthetic.

860
00:33:56,067 --> 00:33:57,834
Do you need
something?

861
00:33:57,869 --> 00:33:58,902
Oh, uh, yeah.

862
00:33:58,936 --> 00:33:59,903
I need you to
cover for me

863
00:33:59,937 --> 00:34:00,904
over at
the kissing booth.

864
00:34:00,938 --> 00:34:02,606
Oh, why? They
fire you already?

865
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:03,774
No!

866
00:34:03,808 --> 00:34:04,775
Penny...

867
00:34:04,809 --> 00:34:06,943
They need me over
at the pony rides.

868
00:34:06,978 --> 00:34:08,912
Wilfred's youngest kid
is trying to milk one of them.

869
00:34:08,946 --> 00:34:09,980
I'll be over there
in a second.

870
00:34:10,014 --> 00:34:12,716
B-t-dub,
loving the new costume.

871
00:34:14,652 --> 00:34:16,520
See?

872
00:34:17,021 --> 00:34:18,855
Well, you've been here
almost a week,

873
00:34:18,890 --> 00:34:20,690
and we still haven't had
a chance to hang out,

874
00:34:20,725 --> 00:34:23,660
I know, just...
So much to do.

875
00:34:24,662 --> 00:34:26,496
Lots to do, right...

876
00:34:26,531 --> 00:34:28,632
I understand.

877
00:34:28,666 --> 00:34:29,633
Take care.

878
00:34:29,667 --> 00:34:31,735
Take care, penny.

879
00:34:38,543 --> 00:34:39,042
Here ya go.

You could be a little
friendlier to penny,

884
00:34:49,554 --> 00:34:50,287
you know.

885
00:34:50,354 --> 00:34:51,922
She's one of the few
people in town

886
00:34:51,956 --> 00:34:53,023
who actually
seems to like you.

887
00:34:53,057 --> 00:34:55,992
Well, I'm not here to win
a popularity contest.

888
00:34:56,027 --> 00:34:59,596
Yeah, that's
pretty clear.

889
00:34:59,630 --> 00:35:00,864
I'm not trying
to be mean,

890
00:35:00,898 --> 00:35:04,134
I just don't have time
to be anyone's bff.

891
00:35:04,168 --> 00:35:07,938
The sooner I get
the restaurant on track,

892
00:35:07,972 --> 00:35:09,973
the sooner we can
return to our lives.

893
00:35:10,007 --> 00:35:13,610
I just need to
stay focused and be...

894
00:35:13,644 --> 00:35:16,546
The fixer.

895
00:35:16,581 --> 00:35:17,948
"The fixer?"

896
00:35:17,982 --> 00:35:19,916
Yeah, it's a...
It's a work thing.

897
00:35:19,951 --> 00:35:21,051
You wouldn't understand.

898
00:35:21,085 --> 00:35:24,654
You're just, you're stuck
in this small-town mentality.

899
00:35:24,689 --> 00:35:27,624
You need to think
bigger picture.

900
00:35:27,658 --> 00:35:31,862
Beyond sycamore Springs.

901
00:35:31,896 --> 00:35:33,029
Okay, miss fixer.

902
00:35:33,064 --> 00:35:34,131
I'll make you a deal.

903
00:35:34,165 --> 00:35:36,633
Enter the race,
and if you win,

904
00:35:36,667 --> 00:35:37,767
I'll sell icb the property.

905
00:35:38,936 --> 00:35:40,704
You're serious?

906
00:35:40,738 --> 00:35:41,838
You want that land?

907
00:35:41,873 --> 00:35:43,607
You've gotta put your menu
where your mouth is.

908
00:35:44,742 --> 00:35:46,510
You're on.

909
00:35:46,544 --> 00:35:47,611
Oh, yeah.

910
00:35:47,645 --> 00:35:48,678
You're on.

911
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:57,854
Ladies and gentlemen,
boys and girls,

912
00:35:57,889 --> 00:35:59,890
as mayor of sycamore Springs,

913
00:35:59,924 --> 00:36:02,759
it is my great honor
to welcome you

914
00:36:02,793 --> 00:36:06,663
to the 25th annual
stuff-your-face race

915
00:36:06,697 --> 00:36:07,831
sponsored by hart's!

916
00:36:13,037 --> 00:36:15,472
Now, each contestant
has to complete the course

917
00:36:15,506 --> 00:36:16,406
through the Springs,

918
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:19,876
and get back here
by any means necessary.

919
00:36:19,911 --> 00:36:21,745
But you must stop
at every station

920
00:36:21,779 --> 00:36:24,514
and finish eating
each portion of food,

921
00:36:24,549 --> 00:36:25,815
or be disqualified.

922
00:36:25,850 --> 00:36:27,717
The first one
across the finish line

923
00:36:27,752 --> 00:36:28,952
is the winner.

924
00:36:28,986 --> 00:36:31,421
- Is everybody ready?
- Excuse me!

925
00:36:31,455 --> 00:36:32,389
Hold on, folks,

926
00:36:32,423 --> 00:36:34,291
looks like we have
a last-minute entry here.

927
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:37,427
Well, I'll be...

928
00:36:37,461 --> 00:36:39,729
It's Willy Jones, everyone!

929
00:36:39,764 --> 00:36:41,665
It's mina.

930
00:36:41,699 --> 00:36:43,466
Even wrote it down on the card.

931
00:36:43,501 --> 00:36:44,734
Okay then.

932
00:36:44,769 --> 00:36:46,269
Racers, on your marks.

933
00:36:46,304 --> 00:36:47,737
Good luck.

934
00:36:47,772 --> 00:36:49,372
Get set...

935
00:37:13,898 --> 00:37:16,266
There's nothing like
farm-fresh cheese.

936
00:38:01,512 --> 00:38:02,545
I thought you said

937
00:38:02,580 --> 00:38:03,780
the food was supposed
to be good at this thing?

938
00:38:03,814 --> 00:38:05,448
Ugh, I need
to lie down.

939
00:38:05,483 --> 00:38:06,483
Okay, good luck.

940
00:38:09,553 --> 00:38:11,521
Just admit it.

941
00:38:11,555 --> 00:38:12,922
Nobody likes the food,

942
00:38:12,957 --> 00:38:15,859
and they're quitting
the race as a result.

943
00:38:15,893 --> 00:38:18,228
Are you trying to
get out of your bet?

944
00:38:18,262 --> 00:38:19,229
No.

945
00:38:19,263 --> 00:38:20,297
Good.

946
00:38:20,331 --> 00:38:22,399
I'll save you a spot
for you at the finish line.

947
00:38:32,610 --> 00:38:34,444
Okay.

948
00:38:45,456 --> 00:38:47,390
Yeah.

949
00:38:52,396 --> 00:38:53,396
I'm a machine.

950
00:38:54,398 --> 00:38:56,266
Come on!

951
00:39:00,638 --> 00:39:01,771
I am so sorry to do this,

952
00:39:01,806 --> 00:39:03,840
but I really need your scooter.

953
00:39:03,874 --> 00:39:06,376
I'll bring it back, I promise!

954
00:39:18,522 --> 00:39:20,123
Yes! Whoo!

955
00:39:20,658 --> 00:39:22,359
Willy, honey, you okay?

956
00:39:24,362 --> 00:39:26,396
Yeah, I'm okay.

957
00:39:37,641 --> 00:39:38,742
So, you think
everyone stopped coming

958
00:39:38,776 --> 00:39:39,743
because of the race?

959
00:39:39,777 --> 00:39:40,777
And because
you make me serve

960
00:39:40,811 --> 00:39:42,612
this inedible food.

961
00:39:42,646 --> 00:39:44,647
Our customers have
high standards.

962
00:39:44,682 --> 00:39:46,015
Half of them are farmers.

963
00:39:46,050 --> 00:39:48,585
What's the point of
making all these changes

964
00:39:48,619 --> 00:39:49,586
if nobody comes?

965
00:39:49,620 --> 00:39:50,987
Don't worry.

966
00:39:51,021 --> 00:39:54,457
There's always a slight
transition when we re-brand.

967
00:39:54,492 --> 00:39:55,492
Slight transition?

968
00:39:55,526 --> 00:39:56,893
This is a mass exodus.

969
00:39:56,927 --> 00:39:59,596
We've tried it your way,
and it's obviously not working.

970
00:39:59,630 --> 00:40:00,930
Why don't we put

971
00:40:00,965 --> 00:40:03,566
some of lucien's ideas
back on the menu?

972
00:40:03,601 --> 00:40:04,868
Unless

973
00:40:04,902 --> 00:40:06,836
icb wants to lose
its entire customer base

974
00:40:06,871 --> 00:40:09,406
at its
flagship restaurant?

975
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:10,273
Maisie's back.

976
00:40:10,307 --> 00:40:12,409
She wants her burger,
the real one.

977
00:40:14,812 --> 00:40:16,980
Sometimes, the rules
need to be broken.

978
00:40:17,014 --> 00:40:20,383
This is not supposed
to happen like this.

979
00:40:20,418 --> 00:40:21,017
Not all of them...

980
00:40:21,051 --> 00:40:22,886
You can keep your posters,

981
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:24,888
and your tablecloths,
and your uniforms,

982
00:40:24,922 --> 00:40:27,657
but give maisie
her burger back.

983
00:40:27,691 --> 00:40:32,629
There's nothing americana
about frozen beef patties.

984
00:40:34,665 --> 00:40:36,499
Okay.

985
00:40:36,534 --> 00:40:39,402
We'll go with fresh ground beef.

986
00:40:54,518 --> 00:40:56,486
I love it!

987
00:41:04,728 --> 00:41:06,062
<i>Hey, how's it going?</i>

988
00:41:06,096 --> 00:41:08,665
Hi, yeah, everything's
going great here.

989
00:41:08,699 --> 00:41:09,666
Are you sure?

990
00:41:09,700 --> 00:41:11,401
Because it doesn't
sound that way.

991
00:41:12,670 --> 00:41:13,703
What?

992
00:41:13,737 --> 00:41:14,771
No, we're...

993
00:41:14,805 --> 00:41:15,905
We're still redecorating.

994
00:41:15,940 --> 00:41:17,040
<i>Listen, Larry says</i>

995
00:41:17,074 --> 00:41:18,074
upstairs is breathing
down his neck.

996
00:41:18,108 --> 00:41:19,943
They've already acquired
new locations,

997
00:41:19,977 --> 00:41:21,744
and they're moving up
the national launch.

998
00:41:21,779 --> 00:41:23,713
They wanna see
the numbers, mina.

999
00:41:23,747 --> 00:41:26,516
I just need a little more time
to iron things out.

1000
00:41:26,550 --> 00:41:27,650
What things?

1001
00:41:27,685 --> 00:41:28,651
<i>Well, for one thing,</i>

1002
00:41:28,686 --> 00:41:29,652
the food.

1003
00:41:29,687 --> 00:41:30,954
I don't know who signed off
on this menu,

1004
00:41:30,988 --> 00:41:33,156
but we should really
talk to Larry about...

1005
00:41:33,190 --> 00:41:34,924
People don't go to
these restaurants for good food,

1006
00:41:34,959 --> 00:41:37,727
they'll go for...
"Americana extreme,

1007
00:41:37,761 --> 00:41:38,795
a fun, familiar menu."

1008
00:41:38,829 --> 00:41:40,497
I know, I just thought...

1009
00:41:40,531 --> 00:41:41,397
<i>Don't over-think it.</i>

1010
00:41:41,432 --> 00:41:42,966
Just do what you were
sent there to do.

1011
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,001
Your future at the company
depends on this.

1012
00:41:45,035 --> 00:41:46,769
Our future depends on it, mina.

1013
00:41:46,804 --> 00:41:47,770
<i>I know. Okay.</i>

1014
00:41:47,805 --> 00:41:48,805
I should go.

1015
00:41:48,839 --> 00:41:50,640
I'll talk to you soon. Bye.

1016
00:41:50,674 --> 00:41:52,342
Okay, bye.

1017
00:41:58,549 --> 00:41:59,549
Hey...

1018
00:41:59,583 --> 00:42:01,684
What do you say
we get outta here?

1019
00:42:01,719 --> 00:42:03,920
I can't, I have to
finish up this report.

1020
00:42:03,954 --> 00:42:06,456
Says the girl that used to
skip Mr. chisholm's class

1021
00:42:06,490 --> 00:42:07,457
every Friday

1022
00:42:07,491 --> 00:42:08,725
to go to the lake?

1023
00:42:08,759 --> 00:42:11,561
Well, that girl has
responsibilities now.

1024
00:42:11,595 --> 00:42:14,497
That girl needs to
come with me now.

1025
00:42:16,567 --> 00:42:17,534
You know,
it's hard to believe

1026
00:42:17,568 --> 00:42:19,035
you actually grew up here.

1027
00:42:19,069 --> 00:42:21,538
I've been saying that
my whole life.

1028
00:42:23,574 --> 00:42:25,508
You ever think
about moving back?

1029
00:42:25,543 --> 00:42:27,610
Starting a family?

1030
00:42:27,645 --> 00:42:30,580
Atlanta is my home now.

1031
00:42:30,614 --> 00:42:31,714
My whole life is there.

1032
00:42:31,749 --> 00:42:35,618
My job, my friends,

1033
00:42:35,653 --> 00:42:37,520
my boyfriend.

1034
00:42:39,557 --> 00:42:42,325
He asked me to move in.

1035
00:42:43,561 --> 00:42:45,929
Wow.

1036
00:42:45,963 --> 00:42:47,564
Well, that's a big step.

1037
00:42:47,598 --> 00:42:50,567
I'm still
thinking about it.

1038
00:42:50,601 --> 00:42:53,336
And you and paisley?

1039
00:42:53,837 --> 00:42:55,572
We broke up.

1040
00:42:55,606 --> 00:42:58,775
She just hasn't
accepted it yet.

1041
00:42:58,809 --> 00:43:01,477
Seems like
it worked out for you,

1042
00:43:01,512 --> 00:43:02,679
getting outta here.

1043
00:43:02,713 --> 00:43:04,047
I knew if I didn't leave
to pursue a career,

1044
00:43:04,081 --> 00:43:08,117
I would have regretted it
my whole life.

1045
00:43:08,152 --> 00:43:12,322
And seeing sycamore Springs now,
everything is the same.

1046
00:43:14,792 --> 00:43:17,694
Well, not everything.

1047
00:43:17,728 --> 00:43:19,629
You're different.

1048
00:43:19,663 --> 00:43:21,497
Always helping everyone.

1049
00:43:22,666 --> 00:43:26,235
Yeah, maybe I just grew up.

1050
00:43:29,607 --> 00:43:31,307
I got one.

1051
00:43:31,342 --> 00:43:32,542
Okay.

1052
00:43:32,576 --> 00:43:33,409
I got one!

1053
00:43:33,444 --> 00:43:34,744
All right, just set...
Set the hook.

1054
00:43:34,778 --> 00:43:36,479
Yeah, yeah,
I got it, I got it.

1055
00:43:36,513 --> 00:43:37,814
Come on...

1056
00:43:37,848 --> 00:43:40,483
Here we are.

1057
00:43:41,719 --> 00:43:44,621
Oh, man!

1058
00:43:44,655 --> 00:43:46,089
What happened?

1059
00:43:46,123 --> 00:43:47,757
He wasn't gonna let
a city girl just reel him in

1060
00:43:47,791 --> 00:43:50,693
without a fight, now, was he?

1061
00:43:53,597 --> 00:43:54,631
Come on.

1062
00:43:56,667 --> 00:43:58,368
I got something
that'll cheer you up.

1063
00:44:06,610 --> 00:44:07,644
Is that it?

1064
00:44:12,850 --> 00:44:14,450
Are you ready?

1065
00:44:14,485 --> 00:44:16,552
Oh, yeah.

1066
00:44:18,689 --> 00:44:19,656
My corvette!

1067
00:44:19,690 --> 00:44:22,659
Check it out.

1068
00:44:22,693 --> 00:44:25,561
You buried my doll?

1069
00:44:25,596 --> 00:44:27,530
She had it coming.

1070
00:44:30,868 --> 00:44:33,236
I've been looking for that.

1071
00:44:34,538 --> 00:44:35,772
Wow.

1072
00:44:35,806 --> 00:44:38,641
My very first mix tape.

1073
00:44:38,676 --> 00:44:40,576
I recorded it from the radio.

1074
00:44:40,611 --> 00:44:42,378
What's on it?

1075
00:44:43,580 --> 00:44:44,714
"Wannabe."

1076
00:44:44,748 --> 00:44:46,549
You remember?

1077
00:44:46,583 --> 00:44:48,818
We used to
go crazy!

1078
00:44:52,623 --> 00:44:54,524
The Cranberries...

1079
00:44:57,661 --> 00:44:58,661
And the waterfalls...

1080
00:45:08,572 --> 00:45:10,807
Thank you.

1081
00:45:10,841 --> 00:45:13,776
I can't believe I forgot
about our time capsule.

1082
00:45:13,811 --> 00:45:15,111
Not me.

1083
00:45:15,145 --> 00:45:19,682
I walk by that spot every day
before I come fishing.

1084
00:45:19,717 --> 00:45:24,220
I can't believe
I didn't dig it up sooner.

1085
00:45:26,724 --> 00:45:30,560
Why didn't you ask me to stay?

1086
00:45:30,594 --> 00:45:32,695
What do you mean?

1087
00:45:32,730 --> 00:45:34,831
Back then, after high school.

1088
00:45:34,865 --> 00:45:37,633
You just let me leave.

1089
00:45:37,668 --> 00:45:39,869
What was I supposed to do?

1090
00:45:39,903 --> 00:45:42,071
You'd already made up your mind.

1091
00:45:42,106 --> 00:45:45,508
I don't know,
I wanted you to fight for me.

1092
00:45:45,542 --> 00:45:46,609
Tell me not to go.

1093
00:45:49,713 --> 00:45:52,849
It felt like you didn't care.

1094
00:45:52,883 --> 00:45:55,818
That's crazy.

1095
00:45:55,853 --> 00:45:57,653
Yeah, well,
I'm a girl.

1096
00:45:57,688 --> 00:46:00,757
We're complex.

1097
00:46:00,791 --> 00:46:03,659
Tell me about it.

1098
00:46:07,631 --> 00:46:11,367
How could you think
I didn't care?

1099
00:46:13,570 --> 00:46:14,670
You were
everything to me.

1100
00:46:28,385 --> 00:46:30,219
I'm sorry.

1101
00:46:31,855 --> 00:46:33,589
My life is just
too complicated right now.

1102
00:46:33,624 --> 00:46:34,657
I can't do this.

1103
00:46:37,728 --> 00:46:40,296
Can you take me back?

1104
00:46:58,715 --> 00:46:59,682
Hi.

1105
00:46:59,716 --> 00:47:01,651
Hi.

1106
00:47:11,662 --> 00:47:12,862
So..?

1107
00:47:12,896 --> 00:47:14,664
Think we should
talk about this?

1108
00:47:14,698 --> 00:47:16,666
About what?

1109
00:47:16,700 --> 00:47:18,701
About how we have
customers again?

1110
00:47:20,003 --> 00:47:21,671
I think giving maisie
her burger back

1111
00:47:21,705 --> 00:47:22,839
really did the trick.

1112
00:47:22,873 --> 00:47:24,907
You think all these people
are back because of maisie?

1113
00:47:24,942 --> 00:47:27,310
Have you seen her Twitter feed?

1114
00:47:29,980 --> 00:47:31,948
What if people start
requesting items

1115
00:47:31,982 --> 00:47:33,783
from the old menu?

1116
00:47:33,817 --> 00:47:34,784
Listen, mina,

1117
00:47:34,818 --> 00:47:36,786
try this.

1118
00:47:44,561 --> 00:47:45,795
Mm!

1119
00:47:45,829 --> 00:47:46,929
That's fantastic.

1120
00:47:46,964 --> 00:47:49,031
As per the menu,

1121
00:47:49,066 --> 00:47:52,034
this is hart's new
"spaghetti americana,"

1122
00:47:52,069 --> 00:47:54,804
but it's really
homemade linguine.

1123
00:47:54,838 --> 00:47:55,805
I used
our heirloom tomatoes

1124
00:47:55,839 --> 00:47:56,939
to make the bolognese.

1125
00:47:56,974 --> 00:47:59,775
Fresh Romano
and a pinch of basil.

1126
00:47:59,810 --> 00:48:01,577
Here.

1127
00:48:03,080 --> 00:48:08,417
The "super veggie
explosion salad"!

1128
00:48:08,452 --> 00:48:09,752
From the menu,

1129
00:48:09,786 --> 00:48:10,853
but all organic
from the garden.

1130
00:48:10,888 --> 00:48:13,890
A lot better than a big bag
of brown lettuce, huh?

1131
00:48:13,924 --> 00:48:14,991
Technically,

1132
00:48:15,025 --> 00:48:17,760
the items are listed
on the new hart's menu.

1133
00:48:17,794 --> 00:48:19,695
I...

1134
00:48:19,730 --> 00:48:21,264
I don't know about this.

1135
00:48:21,298 --> 00:48:24,901
And why did you install another
commercial water fixture?

1136
00:48:24,935 --> 00:48:28,404
Yeah, I wanted to
talk to you about that.

1137
00:48:30,807 --> 00:48:31,941
What is that?

1138
00:48:31,975 --> 00:48:33,809
I just wanted to see
if it works.

1139
00:48:33,844 --> 00:48:34,810
It's a pump.

1140
00:48:34,845 --> 00:48:36,712
A pump for what?

1141
00:48:36,747 --> 00:48:37,947
Water.

1142
00:48:37,981 --> 00:48:39,749
I'm channeling the pure
sycamore Springs water

1143
00:48:39,783 --> 00:48:41,684
on the property.

1144
00:48:41,718 --> 00:48:42,718
Into the restaurant?

1145
00:48:44,488 --> 00:48:45,521
Yes.

1146
00:48:45,555 --> 00:48:46,889
Oh, no, no, no.

1147
00:48:46,924 --> 00:48:48,824
You want to know why
everything tastes so good?

1148
00:48:48,859 --> 00:48:51,894
It's the minerals
in the water.

1149
00:48:51,929 --> 00:48:53,696
We use it to boil the pasta,

1150
00:48:53,730 --> 00:48:56,399
in the soups,
the bread lucien makes.

1151
00:48:57,801 --> 00:49:00,870
You have to admit,
it's pretty impressive.

1152
00:49:00,904 --> 00:49:02,972
Oh, it's more than impressive.

1153
00:49:03,006 --> 00:49:04,573
But you have to take it down.

1154
00:49:04,608 --> 00:49:06,709
Wait, this is...

1155
00:49:06,743 --> 00:49:08,477
Because of what happened
at the lake?

1156
00:49:08,512 --> 00:49:10,680
No.

1157
00:49:10,714 --> 00:49:13,849
It's because of
food safety regulations.

1158
00:49:13,884 --> 00:49:15,918
So this has nothing to do
with you kissing me last night?

1159
00:49:15,953 --> 00:49:16,919
Icb would fire me

1160
00:49:16,954 --> 00:49:18,754
if they found out
I approved this.

1161
00:49:18,822 --> 00:49:20,957
And for the record,
you kissed me.

1162
00:49:20,991 --> 00:49:24,527
For the record,
you seemed pretty into it.

1163
00:49:25,896 --> 00:49:27,697
Willy?

1164
00:49:27,731 --> 00:49:29,732
Oh, for crying out loud...

1165
00:49:29,766 --> 00:49:31,600
How many times do I
have to tell you people?

1166
00:49:31,635 --> 00:49:32,835
It's mina!

1167
00:49:32,869 --> 00:49:34,437
There's someone here
to see you...

1168
00:49:34,471 --> 00:49:35,504
Mina.

1169
00:49:43,513 --> 00:49:44,480
Reed.

1170
00:49:44,514 --> 00:49:45,915
Hi.

1171
00:49:45,949 --> 00:49:47,783
What are you doing here?

1172
00:49:47,818 --> 00:49:48,784
Everything okay?

1173
00:49:48,819 --> 00:49:51,587
No, I mean, yes.
I mean...

1174
00:49:52,923 --> 00:49:55,891
I've been thinking
a lot about us.

1175
00:49:55,926 --> 00:49:57,927
In fact, I can't seem to
stop thinking about us,

1176
00:49:57,961 --> 00:49:58,961
which is why I drove
all the way up here.

1177
00:49:58,996 --> 00:50:01,864
Reed, this really isn't
a good time...

1178
00:50:01,898 --> 00:50:03,899
Mina, you are everything to me.

1179
00:50:04,935 --> 00:50:05,901
And if that means

1180
00:50:05,936 --> 00:50:06,902
I have to adjust
the five-year plan,

1181
00:50:06,937 --> 00:50:08,938
then I'll adjust.

1182
00:50:08,972 --> 00:50:09,972
A successful relationship,

1183
00:50:10,007 --> 00:50:11,574
just like
a successful business,

1184
00:50:11,608 --> 00:50:12,742
has to be fluid.

1185
00:50:12,776 --> 00:50:14,510
I don't want
to lose you.

1186
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:18,881
Reed, please.

1187
00:50:18,915 --> 00:50:20,983
Mina...

1188
00:50:21,018 --> 00:50:22,818
Will you marry me?

1189
00:50:39,936 --> 00:50:43,906
I can't believe
that you just ran off.

1190
00:50:43,940 --> 00:50:44,907
I know.

1191
00:50:44,941 --> 00:50:46,509
I feel awful.

1192
00:50:46,543 --> 00:50:47,209
I just panicked.

1193
00:50:47,244 --> 00:50:51,514
I didn't know
what else to do.

1194
00:50:51,548 --> 00:50:52,848
He sounded bold,

1195
00:50:52,883 --> 00:50:55,418
and romantic.

1196
00:50:55,452 --> 00:50:56,852
He was.

1197
00:50:56,887 --> 00:50:58,821
It's just, there's so much
happening right now,

1198
00:50:58,855 --> 00:51:03,092
and I am...

1199
00:51:03,126 --> 00:51:06,429
This wouldn't have anything
to do with Clay?

1200
00:51:06,463 --> 00:51:07,329
No.

1201
00:51:07,364 --> 00:51:10,533
I'm just, I'm not good
with surprises.

1202
00:51:10,567 --> 00:51:11,500
Well,

1203
00:51:11,535 --> 00:51:14,003
you sure have gotten
yourself in a pickle.

1204
00:51:14,037 --> 00:51:17,006
A nice,
good-looking man

1205
00:51:17,040 --> 00:51:19,608
isn't going to
wait around forever.

1206
00:51:19,643 --> 00:51:21,043
I know, I know.

1207
00:51:21,078 --> 00:51:22,878
I have to give Reed
an answer soon.

1208
00:51:22,913 --> 00:51:23,879
Honey,

1209
00:51:23,914 --> 00:51:28,384
I was talking about Clay.

1210
00:51:33,123 --> 00:51:35,124
I had to drag her
to see the volunteers.

1211
00:51:35,158 --> 00:51:37,927
I know, I tried
taking her to a braves game.

1212
00:51:41,565 --> 00:51:42,832
Hi.

1213
00:51:44,534 --> 00:51:45,067
Hi.

1214
00:51:45,102 --> 00:51:48,370
Well, look who's back.

1215
00:51:49,072 --> 00:51:50,906
Can you give us
a second?

1216
00:51:50,941 --> 00:51:52,675
Yeah.

1217
00:51:53,210 --> 00:51:56,579
Wait, you have to tell me
the secret to your coffee.

1218
00:51:56,613 --> 00:51:58,314
I wish I could.

1219
00:52:03,019 --> 00:52:06,355
I'm so sorry I just ran off.

1220
00:52:06,923 --> 00:52:08,457
It was really sweet of you

1221
00:52:08,492 --> 00:52:09,458
to propose,

1222
00:52:09,493 --> 00:52:11,160
but I just don't want to
make such a big decision

1223
00:52:11,194 --> 00:52:15,598
when I'm so stressed out
and distracted.

1224
00:52:16,967 --> 00:52:19,635
So how long until
you're less distracted?

1225
00:52:21,004 --> 00:52:22,071
I don't know.

1226
00:52:22,105 --> 00:52:24,874
As soon as I wrap this up,
I hope?

1227
00:52:24,908 --> 00:52:26,876
Maybe I'll just stay
till you're done.

1228
00:52:26,910 --> 00:52:28,644
You really don't need
to stay here for me.

1229
00:52:28,678 --> 00:52:29,678
Not a problem.

1230
00:52:29,713 --> 00:52:31,447
I already got
a room at the inn.

1231
00:52:31,481 --> 00:52:32,448
But...

1232
00:52:32,482 --> 00:52:33,315
How did...

1233
00:52:33,350 --> 00:52:34,016
They had a last-minute
cancellation.

1234
00:52:34,050 --> 00:52:35,050
Don't worry about me, okay?

1235
00:52:35,085 --> 00:52:36,952
All I need is
a wall street journal

1236
00:52:36,987 --> 00:52:39,588
and a decent caramel macchiato.

1237
00:52:39,623 --> 00:52:40,389
Or...

1238
00:52:40,423 --> 00:52:41,891
You could soak in
the small town,

1239
00:52:41,925 --> 00:52:43,659
maybe go fishing?

1240
00:52:43,693 --> 00:52:45,528
- Fishing?
- Yeah.

1241
00:52:45,562 --> 00:52:47,463
For fish?

1242
00:52:49,633 --> 00:52:51,033
That's hilarious.

1243
00:52:51,067 --> 00:52:53,702
Direct from
leanne's farm,

1244
00:52:53,737 --> 00:52:55,804
it's the new chicken
and baby back ribs

1245
00:52:55,839 --> 00:52:57,373
"turf and turf combo."

1246
00:52:58,909 --> 00:53:01,610
I tweaked my mom's
bbq sauce recipe.

1247
00:53:02,879 --> 00:53:05,581
Mm, you're right.

1248
00:53:05,615 --> 00:53:07,550
It needed more honey.

1249
00:53:11,054 --> 00:53:13,923
Reed, this is lucien,
the chef de cuisine.

1250
00:53:13,957 --> 00:53:15,691
Chef de cuisine?

1251
00:53:15,725 --> 00:53:16,992
Really?

1252
00:53:17,027 --> 00:53:19,695
Mm! You have to try this.

1253
00:53:19,729 --> 00:53:21,630
No thanks.

1254
00:53:24,968 --> 00:53:27,069
He's making his own sauce?

1255
00:53:27,103 --> 00:53:29,872
This clearly isn't icb approved.

1256
00:53:29,906 --> 00:53:32,708
Are we 100% compliant? No.

1257
00:53:32,742 --> 00:53:33,909
But it was either that

1258
00:53:33,944 --> 00:53:35,044
or lose the local
clientele.

1259
00:53:35,078 --> 00:53:38,581
You want to know the secret
to that coffee you love?

1260
00:53:38,615 --> 00:53:39,915
The water.

1261
00:53:39,950 --> 00:53:41,250
The water?

1262
00:53:41,284 --> 00:53:43,752
Clay came up with a way
to pump it in from the spring.

1263
00:53:43,787 --> 00:53:44,954
I was going to
shut it down, but...

1264
00:53:44,988 --> 00:53:46,121
Mina, what
is happening here?

1265
00:53:46,189 --> 00:53:49,024
Free-range chickens,
off-menu recipes?

1266
00:53:49,059 --> 00:53:52,461
This is all...
Against corporate policy.

1267
00:53:52,495 --> 00:53:53,028
Don't worry,

1268
00:53:53,063 --> 00:53:53,996
I've got this handled.

1269
00:53:54,030 --> 00:53:54,997
You're up here
for one week,

1270
00:53:55,031 --> 00:53:56,031
and this apple pie
country life

1271
00:53:56,066 --> 00:53:58,567
seems to be turning you into
another person.

1272
00:54:02,138 --> 00:54:03,939
Thanks for changing
the menu back.

1273
00:54:03,974 --> 00:54:07,576
It's so much better than
the food from the race.

1274
00:54:07,644 --> 00:54:09,478
I hear you, man.

1275
00:54:09,512 --> 00:54:10,546
Thank you.

1276
00:54:11,681 --> 00:54:12,615
I just want to be clear,

1277
00:54:12,649 --> 00:54:14,683
I'm only letting lucien
serve his recipes

1278
00:54:14,718 --> 00:54:16,685
to get the local
customers back,

1279
00:54:16,720 --> 00:54:19,922
so we can hit
our revenue targets.

1280
00:54:19,956 --> 00:54:21,957
Plus, you think
they're pretty great.

1281
00:54:21,992 --> 00:54:24,760
I don't know what
I think anymore.

1282
00:54:24,794 --> 00:54:27,563
We're still talking
about the food.

1283
00:54:27,597 --> 00:54:29,732
Yes, we are.

1284
00:54:29,766 --> 00:54:31,533
But I hope it's
not too awkward

1285
00:54:31,568 --> 00:54:32,668
with Reed here.

1286
00:54:32,702 --> 00:54:35,037
Oh, it's awkward,

1287
00:54:35,071 --> 00:54:36,905
but he seems like a nice guy,

1288
00:54:36,940 --> 00:54:37,973
and I'm sure
he's going to give you

1289
00:54:38,008 --> 00:54:40,542
the life you've always wanted.

1290
00:54:40,577 --> 00:54:42,011
I hope you said yes

1291
00:54:42,045 --> 00:54:43,012
and apologized
for embarrassing him

1292
00:54:43,046 --> 00:54:44,580
in front of the entire town.

1293
00:54:45,181 --> 00:54:48,684
Well, not that it's
any of your business,

1294
00:54:48,718 --> 00:54:49,985
but...

1295
00:54:50,020 --> 00:54:53,689
I haven't given him
an answer yet.

1296
00:54:56,993 --> 00:54:58,661
Your reservations
are all set.

1297
00:54:58,695 --> 00:54:59,595
Perfect.

1298
00:54:59,629 --> 00:55:01,697
We'll see you next weekend.

1299
00:55:01,731 --> 00:55:02,831
How's everything
with your stay?

1300
00:55:02,866 --> 00:55:04,767
I know you had a rough start

1301
00:55:04,801 --> 00:55:07,803
with that whole
proposal situation.

1302
00:55:07,837 --> 00:55:08,937
Yes, um,

1303
00:55:08,972 --> 00:55:11,740
other than that,
it's fine, thank you.

1304
00:55:11,775 --> 00:55:13,175
You don't, uh,

1305
00:55:13,209 --> 00:55:15,778
happen to know the owner
of hart's, do you?

1306
00:55:15,812 --> 00:55:17,746
Clay?
Sure, we go way back.

1307
00:55:17,781 --> 00:55:19,715
And mina?

1308
00:55:19,749 --> 00:55:20,983
Yes.

1309
00:55:21,017 --> 00:55:22,184
Everybody knows everybody.

1310
00:55:22,218 --> 00:55:25,487
She never told you any stories
about growing up here?

1311
00:55:26,222 --> 00:55:28,691
How they were homecoming
king and queen?

1312
00:55:28,725 --> 00:55:30,793
So they were friendly?

1313
00:55:30,827 --> 00:55:32,061
Friendly?

1314
00:55:32,095 --> 00:55:34,963
They were in love.

1315
00:55:34,998 --> 00:55:36,665
You don't think
it's a little odd

1316
00:55:36,700 --> 00:55:37,700
that you didn't tell me

1317
00:55:37,734 --> 00:55:39,068
the owner is
your ex-boyfriend?

1318
00:55:39,102 --> 00:55:41,003
No, because
it's not an issue.

1319
00:55:41,037 --> 00:55:43,205
Well, it is to me.

1320
00:55:43,239 --> 00:55:46,041
Please don't get
worked up over this.

1321
00:55:46,076 --> 00:55:47,743
It was such
a long time ago.

1322
00:55:47,777 --> 00:55:48,877
I'm not getting
worked up.

1323
00:55:48,912 --> 00:55:51,146
I just think it's...
Interesting.

1324
00:55:51,181 --> 00:55:53,615
And what is with
that ridiculous name

1325
00:55:53,650 --> 00:55:54,683
everyone keeps
calling you?

1326
00:55:54,718 --> 00:55:56,618
Ah, there they are.
Willy!

1327
00:55:56,653 --> 00:55:58,554
That. Exactly.

1328
00:55:59,756 --> 00:56:01,156
Wow, okay,
he's just everywhere.

1329
00:56:01,191 --> 00:56:03,625
I thought you were working
on the lighting install?

1330
00:56:04,794 --> 00:56:05,761
All done.

1331
00:56:05,795 --> 00:56:06,762
And the new signage?

1332
00:56:06,796 --> 00:56:08,731
Put it all up.

1333
00:56:08,765 --> 00:56:09,998
Who's your
fancy clothes friend?

1334
00:56:10,033 --> 00:56:13,001
Sorry. Deacon,
this is Reed.

1335
00:56:13,036 --> 00:56:15,537
Oh, right, you're the guy.

1336
00:56:15,572 --> 00:56:16,638
Yeah, uh,

1337
00:56:16,673 --> 00:56:17,806
sorry about that,
brother.

1338
00:56:17,841 --> 00:56:18,841
Great.

1339
00:56:18,875 --> 00:56:21,009
Thank you, Deacon.

1340
00:56:21,044 --> 00:56:22,010
Hey, the least we could do

1341
00:56:22,045 --> 00:56:23,512
is take our visitor
on a tour around town?

1342
00:56:23,546 --> 00:56:24,813
Yeah.

1343
00:56:24,848 --> 00:56:25,848
That's really not necessary.

1344
00:56:25,882 --> 00:56:26,849
You know what,

1345
00:56:26,883 --> 00:56:27,850
that sounds great.

1346
00:56:27,884 --> 00:56:28,851
Mina hasn't told me

1347
00:56:28,885 --> 00:56:30,519
anything about
this place.

1348
00:56:30,553 --> 00:56:31,653
Well, follow us.

1349
00:56:31,688 --> 00:56:33,088
You're gonna love this.

1350
00:56:33,123 --> 00:56:35,057
Due to all
the contained gases,

1351
00:56:35,091 --> 00:56:36,825
sycamore Springs'
mineral water

1352
00:56:36,860 --> 00:56:38,727
is actually effervescent,

1353
00:56:38,762 --> 00:56:40,195
a.K.A. Sparkling,

1354
00:56:40,230 --> 00:56:42,631
and finally,
on this side of the lake,

1355
00:56:42,665 --> 00:56:44,133
the blue house right there

1356
00:56:44,167 --> 00:56:47,770
is George Clooney's
second cousin's summer cottage.

1357
00:56:47,804 --> 00:56:49,872
Thank you, Deacon,
for that random tour

1358
00:56:49,906 --> 00:56:51,807
filled with
fun facts.

1359
00:56:51,841 --> 00:56:53,075
I found it
very interesting.

1360
00:56:53,109 --> 00:56:54,743
Who knew that s'mores
were invented right here

1361
00:56:54,778 --> 00:56:55,878
in sycamore Springs.

1362
00:56:55,912 --> 00:56:58,013
Well, storyteller's
just one of my many skills.

1363
00:56:58,047 --> 00:56:59,515
Who wants a beer?

1364
00:56:59,549 --> 00:57:00,749
That's me.

1365
00:57:04,754 --> 00:57:05,754
You want one,
chief?

1366
00:57:05,789 --> 00:57:07,589
Yeah.

1367
00:57:13,229 --> 00:57:15,030
Once we get
the boats fixed,

1368
00:57:15,064 --> 00:57:16,265
I've got a whole business plan

1369
00:57:16,299 --> 00:57:19,101
on how we're going to reboot
the hot Springs tours.

1370
00:57:19,135 --> 00:57:21,103
How many businesses
do you own again?

1371
00:57:21,137 --> 00:57:22,171
Well, I got
two up and running.

1372
00:57:22,205 --> 00:57:24,039
I've got five more
in my head.

1373
00:57:24,073 --> 00:57:25,040
I wanna go on shark tank

1374
00:57:25,074 --> 00:57:28,510
with a whole new
macrobrew idea I got.

1375
00:57:28,545 --> 00:57:29,511
Macro-brew?

1376
00:57:29,546 --> 00:57:30,646
Mm-hmm.

1377
00:57:30,680 --> 00:57:33,682
Bigger better beer, buddy.

1378
00:57:33,716 --> 00:57:34,850
Can we go now?

1379
00:57:34,884 --> 00:57:37,653
We've still got
one more stop on the tour.

1380
00:57:48,765 --> 00:57:51,400
This is where
you grew up?

1381
00:57:51,434 --> 00:57:52,134
Yup.

1382
00:57:52,168 --> 00:57:53,836
I haven't seen it since I left.

1383
00:57:53,870 --> 00:57:55,904
Home sweet home.

1384
00:57:55,939 --> 00:57:57,105
What happened?

1385
00:57:57,140 --> 00:57:58,774
The people that bought it
from your parents

1386
00:57:58,808 --> 00:57:59,775
lost their jobs,

1387
00:57:59,809 --> 00:58:01,743
the bank repossessed it in 2007.

1388
00:58:01,778 --> 00:58:03,812
It's been like this ever since.

1389
00:58:03,847 --> 00:58:05,113
Remember how we used to
climb up on the roof,

1390
00:58:05,148 --> 00:58:09,751
throw water balloons
into Mr. Patterson's yard?

1391
00:58:13,890 --> 00:58:15,791
Come on, let's go

1392
00:58:15,825 --> 00:58:18,093
what are you...?

1393
00:58:18,127 --> 00:58:20,629
You don't even know
the structural integrity

1394
00:58:20,663 --> 00:58:21,563
of this house.

1395
00:58:21,598 --> 00:58:22,931
I'm just gonna look,
I'll be right back.

1396
00:58:22,966 --> 00:58:25,434
You'll break your neck!

1397
00:58:32,609 --> 00:58:33,575
Got it?

1398
00:58:33,610 --> 00:58:34,710
Oh, yeah.

1399
00:58:44,521 --> 00:58:45,888
You can still
smell the flowers

1400
00:58:45,922 --> 00:58:47,856
and the hay.

1401
00:58:47,891 --> 00:58:49,791
They're coming back.

1402
00:58:49,826 --> 00:58:50,792
What?

1403
00:58:50,827 --> 00:58:52,761
Your senses.

1404
00:58:54,130 --> 00:58:56,665
The country'll do that to you.

1405
00:58:56,699 --> 00:58:57,799
Hmm.

1406
00:59:02,672 --> 00:59:05,407
I miss this view.

1407
00:59:06,609 --> 00:59:07,676
So do I.

1408
00:59:20,223 --> 00:59:22,624
So how come you didn't
invite that boy

1409
00:59:22,659 --> 00:59:23,892
for supper tonight?

1410
00:59:23,927 --> 00:59:26,728
That isn't very
Southern of you.

1411
00:59:26,763 --> 00:59:27,729
I did.

1412
00:59:27,764 --> 00:59:29,765
He said he had
some work to finish up.

1413
00:59:29,799 --> 00:59:31,733
You look as confused

1414
00:59:31,768 --> 00:59:34,069
as a pine tree
in a parking lot.

1415
00:59:34,103 --> 00:59:36,939
The more I think about it,
the more confused I get.

1416
00:59:36,973 --> 00:59:39,808
I thought I knew
exactly what I wanted.

1417
00:59:39,842 --> 00:59:41,076
And then...

1418
00:59:41,110 --> 00:59:44,846
And then you came back
to sycamore Springs?

1419
00:59:44,881 --> 00:59:46,114
Well, moaning
about it with me

1420
00:59:46,149 --> 00:59:48,850
isn't gonna do you
any good.

1421
00:59:48,885 --> 00:59:50,118
Talk to Reed.

1422
00:59:50,153 --> 00:59:51,954
Tell him what's
really going on

1423
00:59:51,988 --> 00:59:54,890
inside that thick
skull of yours.

1424
00:59:54,924 --> 00:59:57,392
Yeah, maybe.

1425
01:00:00,964 --> 01:00:02,898
Yeah, I know.

1426
01:00:02,932 --> 01:00:05,667
It's a little more complicated
than we thought.

1427
01:00:06,803 --> 01:00:07,936
But I think
I've found something.

1428
01:00:09,806 --> 01:00:11,707
Hang on, Larry.

1429
01:00:15,945 --> 01:00:18,246
Sorry, I'm back.

1430
01:00:18,281 --> 01:00:20,916
Yeah, I'll be working on this
all day tomorrow.

1431
01:00:20,950 --> 01:00:22,918
I'll call you soon
with a detailed report,

1432
01:00:22,952 --> 01:00:26,755
but don't worry, I got this.

1433
01:00:26,789 --> 01:00:28,724
Okay, bye.

1434
01:00:40,003 --> 01:00:42,638
Happy Valentine's day.

1435
01:00:44,974 --> 01:00:46,008
But they're...

1436
01:00:46,042 --> 01:00:48,043
Enormous.

1437
01:00:48,077 --> 01:00:49,845
Antique French roses.

1438
01:00:49,879 --> 01:00:51,013
Wow, how did you...

1439
01:00:51,047 --> 01:00:52,547
I special
ordered them.

1440
01:00:52,582 --> 01:00:53,715
Overnight.

1441
01:00:53,750 --> 01:00:56,718
From Paris.

1442
01:00:56,753 --> 01:00:57,886
That is super sweet, Reed.

1443
01:00:57,920 --> 01:00:59,921
Wow, thank you.

1444
01:00:59,956 --> 01:01:01,023
Mm-hmm.

1445
01:01:01,057 --> 01:01:03,759
Hey, how come you didn't
call me back last night?

1446
01:01:04,894 --> 01:01:06,862
Too much work.

1447
01:01:06,896 --> 01:01:08,764
I'm sorry, my bad.

1448
01:01:08,798 --> 01:01:10,832
Speaking of bad,

1449
01:01:10,867 --> 01:01:13,902
the fashion in this town
is dubious at best.

1450
01:01:13,936 --> 01:01:14,903
I know,

1451
01:01:14,937 --> 01:01:17,372
but the people
kinda grow on you.

1452
01:01:17,407 --> 01:01:19,875
That's exactly what
I'm concerned about, mina.

1453
01:01:19,909 --> 01:01:20,976
You're letting
your sentiment

1454
01:01:21,010 --> 01:01:22,778
cloud your judgement.

1455
01:01:22,812 --> 01:01:24,680
I'm doing what I think
is best...

1456
01:01:24,714 --> 01:01:25,747
For everyone.

1457
01:01:25,782 --> 01:01:26,815
Everyone?

1458
01:01:26,849 --> 01:01:28,950
Icb is all that matters.

1459
01:01:28,985 --> 01:01:31,753
Look, I've had
to do things

1460
01:01:31,821 --> 01:01:32,988
that I'm not proud of,

1461
01:01:33,022 --> 01:01:35,290
but at the end of the day,
you have to get the job done.

1462
01:01:35,324 --> 01:01:37,826
And I told you,
I've got this handled.

1463
01:01:39,095 --> 01:01:40,062
I'm sorry, okay?

1464
01:01:40,096 --> 01:01:42,864
You're right. I...

1465
01:01:42,899 --> 01:01:44,766
I just really
want you back home

1466
01:01:44,801 --> 01:01:46,101
with me.

1467
01:01:46,135 --> 01:01:49,538
The sweetheart dance
starts in two hours.

1468
01:01:50,073 --> 01:01:51,073
I've got a ton of work,

1469
01:01:51,107 --> 01:01:52,808
and you know I'm not really
the festival type.

1470
01:01:56,212 --> 01:01:58,213
But if we're going to
get married,

1471
01:01:58,247 --> 01:02:00,515
I think it's good to know
where we both come from.

1472
01:02:00,550 --> 01:02:01,750
Right?

1473
01:02:01,784 --> 01:02:02,751
Are you sure?

1474
01:02:02,785 --> 01:02:04,019
Absolutely.
It'll be fun,

1475
01:02:04,053 --> 01:02:05,854
and I'll meet you there,

1476
01:02:05,888 --> 01:02:06,822

Deacon, anyway?

Oh, sweetie,
we don't have the time.

1489
01:02:47,296 --> 01:02:49,931
Hey, wasn't your man
supposed to meet you here?

1490
01:02:49,966 --> 01:02:51,233
That was him.

1491
01:02:51,267 --> 01:02:54,903
Doesn't look like he's
gonna make it anymore.

1492
01:02:54,937 --> 01:02:56,104
Well, don't worry,

1493
01:02:56,139 --> 01:02:58,573
we'll just make it
a girls' night.

1494
01:02:59,876 --> 01:03:00,976
Penny, I want
to apologize

1495
01:03:01,010 --> 01:03:02,978
for being such
a pain in the neck.

1496
01:03:03,012 --> 01:03:05,814
I think I was just
a little nervous

1497
01:03:05,848 --> 01:03:08,083
about coming back home.

01:03:08,117 --> 01:03:10,051
Well, I'm glad you did.

1499
01:03:10,086 --> 01:03:12,788
I mean, you've really
shaken things up around here.

1500
01:03:15,057 --> 01:03:16,024
Happy Valentine's day, ladies.

1501
01:03:16,058 --> 01:03:18,026
Well, don't you look
pretty tonight,

1502
01:03:18,060 --> 01:03:19,628
Ms. laterner.

1503
01:03:19,662 --> 01:03:20,896
Nice try, Deacon,

1504
01:03:20,930 --> 01:03:22,364
but I've told you
a million times, we're over.

1505
01:03:22,398 --> 01:03:26,434
Well, your body language
is telling me something else.

1506
01:03:27,036 --> 01:03:28,069
Besides,
can't you see

1507
01:03:28,104 --> 01:03:29,971
we're having
a girls' night?

1508
01:03:30,006 --> 01:03:31,106
I was just wondering

1509
01:03:31,140 --> 01:03:32,908
if you wanted to accompany me
on the dance floor?

1510
01:03:32,942 --> 01:03:36,044
I probably shouldn't
if I know what's best for me.

1511
01:03:36,078 --> 01:03:38,046
Since when did you start
doing that?

1512
01:03:38,080 --> 01:03:40,549
Well, he does
have a point.

Well, he's not here.

Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

1533

That's obviously
not how it's done.

1534
01:04:51,554 --> 01:04:53,421
Move aside.

1535
01:05:05,768 --> 01:05:07,736
Is this part of
your diabolical plan

1536
01:05:07,770 --> 01:05:08,904

1570
01:06:40,196 --> 01:06:42,864
so glad you've come
to your senses

1571
01:06:42,898 --> 01:06:44,899
bringing back
the old hart's menu.

1572

fresh ingredients

1574
01:06:49,772 --> 01:06:51,072
that we've always used.

1575
01:06:51,107 --> 01:06:54,743
A perfect blend
of the old and the new.

1576
01:06:54,777 --> 01:06:55,744
Well, whatever
you call it,

1577
01:06:55,778 --> 01:06:56,745
it's just nice

1578
01:06:56,779 --> 01:06:58,446
to have family
back again.

1579
01:06:58,481 --> 01:07:00,882
Family?

1580
01:07:00,916 --> 01:07:03,118
Willy, this town
is just one big family.

1581
01:07:03,152 --> 01:07:06,087
Sure, people go
to hart's to eat,

1582
01:07:06,122 --> 01:07:08,656
but most of us go there
to see folks we know,

1583
01:07:08,691 --> 01:07:10,658
say "hi" and catch up.

1584
01:07:11,894 --> 01:07:15,530
You have been away
for too long.

1585
01:07:19,902 --> 01:07:21,603
You okay?

1586
01:07:21,637 --> 01:07:23,805
She's right.

1587
01:07:23,839 --> 01:07:25,673
I forgot about all of this.

1588
01:07:26,175 --> 01:07:29,644
But not just because
I've been away.

1589
01:07:29,678 --> 01:07:30,645
I wanted to.

1590
01:07:30,679 --> 01:07:32,547
Why?

1591
01:07:32,581 --> 01:07:33,982
Because if I forgot,

1592
01:07:34,016 --> 01:07:36,584
I wouldn't have to think about
what I left behind.

1593
01:07:42,558 --> 01:07:43,992
To old times.

1594
01:07:44,026 --> 01:07:46,428
To good old times.

1595
01:07:54,670 --> 01:07:57,439

Reed.

1597
01:07:58,707 --> 01:08:00,508
So sorry
to interrupt.

1598
01:08:00,543 --> 01:08:01,576
No, we were just...

1599
01:08:01,610 --> 01:08:02,444
Yeah, you can drop

1600
01:08:02,478 --> 01:08:03,912
the whole naive
cowboy thing, okay?

1601
01:08:03,946 --> 01:08:05,480
Reed, stop.

1602
01:08:05,514 --> 01:08:06,548
Excuse me?

1603
01:08:06,582 --> 01:08:07,916
It's desperate, and it's obvious
what you're doing.

1604
01:08:07,950 --> 01:08:11,052
What is it that
I'm doing, exactly?

1605
01:08:11,087 --> 01:08:12,987
Trying to recreate
some sad, high school fantasy

1606
01:08:13,022 --> 01:08:14,656
with your homecoming queen,

1607
01:08:14,690 --> 01:08:16,091
who dumped you 15 years ago.

1608
01:08:16,125 --> 01:08:17,692
It's really
quite pathetic.

1609
01:08:17,760 --> 01:08:18,693
Reed, I mean it. Stop.

1610
01:08:18,727 --> 01:08:20,795
You know
what's pathetic?

1611
01:08:20,830 --> 01:08:21,996
Proposing to your girlfriend

1612
01:08:22,031 --> 01:08:23,698
when she's obviously
not into you.

1613
01:08:25,468 --> 01:08:26,835
Okay.

1614
01:08:26,869 --> 01:08:28,136
Think what you want, farm boy.

1615
01:08:28,170 --> 01:08:31,039
But you are done holding
an entire corporation hostage.

1616
01:08:31,073 --> 01:08:33,675
It's over, my friend.

1617
01:08:33,709 --> 01:08:34,943
What?

1618
01:08:34,977 --> 01:08:37,178
For starters, your father's
contract with icb

1619
01:08:37,213 --> 01:08:39,714
clearly prohibits transferring
ownership of the property

1620
01:08:39,748 --> 01:08:40,915
to anyone.

1621
01:08:40,950 --> 01:08:42,650
Clay, I'm sorry,

1622
01:08:42,685 --> 01:08:43,551
I should have
told you about...

1623
01:08:43,586 --> 01:08:44,986
On top of that,
the local bank told me

1624
01:08:45,020 --> 01:08:47,088
about your loan of $100,000

1625
01:08:47,123 --> 01:08:48,990
taken out
against your business,

1626
01:08:49,024 --> 01:08:51,459
apparently
to invest in Deacon's bar.

1627
01:08:51,494 --> 01:08:52,227
Such action,

1628
01:08:52,261 --> 01:08:53,795
and this is
my favorite part,

1629
01:08:53,829 --> 01:08:55,997
will result in the mortgage
and entire property

1630
01:08:56,031 --> 01:08:58,833
being turned over to icb.

1631
01:08:58,868 --> 01:09:01,636
Willy, how does
he know all this?

1632
01:09:01,670 --> 01:09:02,637
Because you're not
the only one

1633
01:09:02,671 --> 01:09:04,639
with a workplace
romance, cowboy.

1634
01:09:04,673 --> 01:09:07,475
You two
work together?

1635
01:09:07,510 --> 01:09:08,543
Uh-huh.

1636
01:09:09,645 --> 01:09:11,446
Clay...

1637
01:09:13,549 --> 01:09:14,549
Clay!

1638
01:09:17,953 --> 01:09:18,987
I can't believe you did this.

1639
01:09:19,021 --> 01:09:20,188
And behind my back?

1640
01:09:20,222 --> 01:09:21,923
Larry was worried
you weren't handling things.

1641
01:09:21,957 --> 01:09:24,492
So, he sent you here
to spy on me?

1642
01:09:24,527 --> 01:09:25,660
To help you,

1643
01:09:25,694 --> 01:09:27,128
and I'm glad he did.

1644
01:09:27,163 --> 01:09:28,863
The whole deal might have
fallen apart.

1645
01:09:28,898 --> 01:09:29,964
You could have been fired.

1646
01:09:29,999 --> 01:09:32,600
And you proposing to me,
was that Larry's idea, too?

1647
01:09:32,635 --> 01:09:33,468
Of course not.

1648
01:09:33,502 --> 01:09:34,702
I want us to make
a life together...

1649
01:09:34,737 --> 01:09:36,671
And this is
how you show me?

1650
01:09:36,705 --> 01:09:38,506
I'm just
trying to help.

1651
01:09:38,541 --> 01:09:39,574
Now the deal's done,

1652
01:09:39,608 --> 01:09:40,608
and icb will be thrilled.

1653
01:09:40,643 --> 01:09:41,776
You'll get your promotion,

1654
01:09:41,810 --> 01:09:44,712
and we can get out of this town
and back to our lives.

1655
01:09:44,747 --> 01:09:46,447
I thought that's
what you wanted?

1656
01:09:48,651 --> 01:09:50,552
Not anymore.

1657
01:09:50,586 --> 01:09:51,553
Please don't tell me

1658
01:09:51,587 --> 01:09:53,922
you've actually fallen
for his country boy act?

1659
01:09:53,956 --> 01:09:56,624
Go home, Reed.

1660
01:09:56,659 --> 01:09:57,625
It's over.

1661
01:09:57,660 --> 01:09:58,760
Mina, wait!

1662
01:09:59,762 --> 01:10:01,596
And my name's not mina,

1663
01:10:01,630 --> 01:10:03,631
it's Willy.

1664
01:10:23,485 --> 01:10:24,485
Has anyone seen Clay?

1665
01:10:26,922 --> 01:10:29,457
Grace, it's not what you think.

1666
01:10:30,926 --> 01:10:31,926
You have some nerve,
little lady.

1667
01:10:31,961 --> 01:10:34,429
First, you take away
his restaurant,

1668
01:10:34,463 --> 01:10:35,363
and then his heart.

1669
01:10:35,397 --> 01:10:38,266
I don't know
how you can sleep at night.

1670
01:10:55,851 --> 01:10:57,352
What are you doing here?

1671
01:10:58,587 --> 01:11:00,822
I wanted
to talk to you.

1672
01:11:00,856 --> 01:11:02,857
I know what
you're thinking,

1673
01:11:02,891 --> 01:11:04,859
but it's not what it looks like.

1674
01:11:04,893 --> 01:11:05,927
Well, it looks like

1675
01:11:05,961 --> 01:11:07,562
you've been lying to me
this whole time,

1676
01:11:07,596 --> 01:11:08,896
working with Reed
to shut me down.

1677
01:11:08,931 --> 01:11:12,834
Yes, we work together,
but that was not the plan.

1678
01:11:12,868 --> 01:11:13,868
Well, I don't think

1679
01:11:13,902 --> 01:11:14,869
there's any doubt in your mind

1680
01:11:14,903 --> 01:11:16,004
whether or not
you should marry him.

1681
01:11:16,038 --> 01:11:18,473
You two are perfect
for each other.

1682
01:11:19,575 --> 01:11:21,409
Looks like
you and paisley are, too.

1683
01:11:21,443 --> 01:11:22,477
What does that mean?

1684
01:11:22,511 --> 01:11:23,511
I saw you,

1685
01:11:23,545 --> 01:11:24,512
kissing her.

1686
01:11:25,648 --> 01:11:27,315
That's not...

1687
01:11:27,349 --> 01:11:27,882
Not what?

1688
01:11:27,916 --> 01:11:29,384
What it looks like?

1689
01:11:29,418 --> 01:11:30,251
She kissed me.

1690
01:11:30,286 --> 01:11:32,820
I promise you,
it's over between us.

1691
01:11:32,855 --> 01:11:36,057
You know what,
it doesn't matter.

1692
01:11:36,091 --> 01:11:37,992
All these years, I've been
trying to prove to myself

1693
01:11:38,027 --> 01:11:40,561
that, even in this small town,

1694
01:11:40,596 --> 01:11:42,363
I could make something
of my life.

1695
01:11:42,398 --> 01:11:43,598
You have.

1696
01:11:43,632 --> 01:11:46,801
You know what
the worst part is?

1697
01:11:46,835 --> 01:11:48,603
Is I actually thought

1698
01:11:48,637 --> 01:11:51,506
that you might
fall back in love with me.

1699
01:11:52,541 --> 01:11:53,775
Clay...

1700
01:11:53,809 --> 01:11:55,310
But you're right.

1701
01:11:55,344 --> 01:11:58,880
Nothing changes.

1702
01:11:58,914 --> 01:12:00,848
I'm still
a small-town guy,

1703
01:12:00,883 --> 01:12:02,116
and you're still
the same girl

1704
01:12:02,151 --> 01:12:04,652
that'll run over anyone
to get what she wants.

1705
01:12:04,687 --> 01:12:07,455
At least this time,
I'm the one walking away.

1706
01:13:30,439 --> 01:13:32,440
Hi, honey?

1707
01:13:34,610 --> 01:13:36,444
Clay was going to
propose to me.

1708
01:13:36,478 --> 01:13:38,513
What?

1709
01:13:43,619 --> 01:13:45,720
I found a letter...

1710
01:13:45,754 --> 01:13:48,055
And a ring.

1711
01:13:48,090 --> 01:13:51,659
I always thought he didn't
want to be with me,

1712
01:13:51,693 --> 01:13:52,960
that he just wanted
to stay here

1713
01:13:52,995 --> 01:13:56,597
and do nothing
with his whole life.

1714
01:13:56,632 --> 01:13:58,599
Well, what did it say?

1715
01:13:59,835 --> 01:14:01,636
It said
he didn't want me to leave.

1716
01:14:04,907 --> 01:14:07,408
That he'd be lost
without me.

1717
01:14:08,911 --> 01:14:11,045
That he knew we were young,

1718
01:14:11,079 --> 01:14:15,616
but that his heart knew
we were supposed to be together.

1719
01:14:16,852 --> 01:14:21,689
It said he wanted me to meet him
on the dock the next day.

1720
01:14:21,723 --> 01:14:25,526
He had something important
he wanted to ask me.

1721
01:14:25,561 --> 01:14:28,629
The day you left.

1722
01:14:29,631 --> 01:14:30,665
Oh...

1723
01:14:35,471 --> 01:14:37,505
Honey.

1724
01:14:38,740 --> 01:14:42,443
I messed everything up.

1725
01:15:46,575 --> 01:15:48,509
Okay...

1726
01:15:50,646 --> 01:15:52,713
That new motor's
looking real good.

1727
01:15:52,748 --> 01:15:54,982
You know it.

1728
01:15:55,017 --> 01:15:56,984
Darrell was practically
givin' it away.

1729
01:15:57,019 --> 01:16:00,187
We've gotta fix
those vinyl seats, too.

1730
01:16:01,657 --> 01:16:02,990
Hey, listen, man.

1731
01:16:03,025 --> 01:16:05,560
I'm really sorry
about this whole thing.

1732
01:16:05,594 --> 01:16:06,561
Oh, Deacon, don't.

1733
01:16:06,595 --> 01:16:08,496
No, if you hadn't have
given me the loan...

1734
01:16:08,530 --> 01:16:09,497
And I'd do it again.

1735
01:16:09,531 --> 01:16:11,365
You're my best friend.

1736
01:16:11,400 --> 01:16:12,433
That's the way I roll.

1737
01:16:12,467 --> 01:16:16,003
Well, I really appreciate it.

1738
01:16:16,038 --> 01:16:17,572
Hey, will you clock the wheel
for me?

1739
01:16:17,606 --> 01:16:18,639
I want to see if she turns.

1740
01:16:25,814 --> 01:16:27,782
It's perfect.

1741
01:16:27,816 --> 01:16:30,217
So, what are you gonna do now?

1742
01:16:31,453 --> 01:16:33,020
Nothing.

1743
01:16:33,055 --> 01:16:35,590
Not about the restaurant,
about Willy.

1744
01:16:36,825 --> 01:16:39,527
She went back to Atlanta

1745
01:16:39,561 --> 01:16:41,662
to marry that guy, Reed.

1746
01:16:41,697 --> 01:16:43,598
She may be
goin' back to Atlanta,

1747
01:16:43,632 --> 01:16:44,599
but she's not goin' back
to that jerk.

1748
01:16:44,633 --> 01:16:45,633
They broke up.

1749
01:16:46,735 --> 01:16:47,802
Who told you that?

1750
01:16:47,836 --> 01:16:49,437
Lewis saw
the whole thing

1751
01:16:49,471 --> 01:16:50,571
at the festival last night.

1752
01:16:50,606 --> 01:16:51,606
He told me.

1753
01:16:52,774 --> 01:16:54,241
Are you sure?

1754
01:16:54,276 --> 01:16:54,809
No.

1755
01:16:54,843 --> 01:16:56,711
His eyesight is goin'.

1756
01:16:56,745 --> 01:16:58,646
But what
does it matter?

1757
01:16:58,680 --> 01:16:59,814
You love her.

1758
01:16:59,848 --> 01:17:03,517
Stop feeling sorry for yourself
and go fight for her.

1759
01:17:03,552 --> 01:17:06,187
Go get that girl back.

1760
01:17:09,691 --> 01:17:12,560
O...Okay.

1761
01:17:13,629 --> 01:17:15,262
Thanks, bud.

1762
01:17:18,867 --> 01:17:21,402
And, finally,

1763
01:17:21,436 --> 01:17:22,637
a big thank you to Phil,

1764
01:17:22,671 --> 01:17:24,472
our executive vice president,

1765
01:17:24,506 --> 01:17:25,673
who's joined us today.

1766
01:17:27,809 --> 01:17:29,810
And now,
let me turn things over

1767
01:17:29,845 --> 01:17:31,779
to our brand manager

1768
01:17:31,813 --> 01:17:35,650
for the national launch
of hart's americana restaurants,

1769
01:17:35,684 --> 01:17:37,618
mina Jones.

1770
01:17:40,722 --> 01:17:43,257
- Thank you, sir.
- Congratulations.

1771
01:17:43,759 --> 01:17:46,460
Thank you, Larry.

1772
01:17:47,763 --> 01:17:49,230
I, um...

1773
01:17:50,599 --> 01:17:52,900
I think we're making a mistake.

1774
01:17:52,934 --> 01:17:56,437
In fact, I know we're making
a huge mistake.

1775
01:17:57,673 --> 01:17:59,707
I think that, um, what
mina's trying to say is...

1776
01:17:59,741 --> 01:18:02,276
I've got this, Larry.

1777
01:18:06,682 --> 01:18:08,749
We shouldn't be launching hart's

1778
01:18:08,784 --> 01:18:11,819
as just another
cookie-cutter chain,

1779
01:18:11,853 --> 01:18:14,622
but as a completely new,
organic,

1780
01:18:14,656 --> 01:18:15,690
farm-to-table concept,

1781
01:18:15,724 --> 01:18:19,660
providing quality food
at small-town prices.

1782
01:18:19,695 --> 01:18:20,795
Ms. Jones,

1783
01:18:20,829 --> 01:18:22,630
as much as
I appreciate your input here,

1784
01:18:22,664 --> 01:18:23,964
this is not the place or time

1785
01:18:23,999 --> 01:18:26,701
to be making significant
changes to the brand.

1786
01:18:26,735 --> 01:18:27,768
Then when is?

1787
01:18:27,803 --> 01:18:29,770
"Fresh-casual"

1788
01:18:29,805 --> 01:18:31,439
is the new fast food.

1789
01:18:31,473 --> 01:18:32,740
Icb needs
to be a company

1790
01:18:32,774 --> 01:18:34,709
that listens to
what the American people want...

1791
01:18:34,743 --> 01:18:37,611
Larry, um,
I just want to say

1792
01:18:37,646 --> 01:18:40,448
that I have
nothing to do with this.

1793
01:18:40,482 --> 01:18:41,549
I wasn't consulted at all...

1794
01:18:41,583 --> 01:18:42,616
That's true,

1795
01:18:42,651 --> 01:18:43,751
so why don't you just
sit down

1796
01:18:43,785 --> 01:18:45,352
and zip it, Reed.

1797
01:18:46,388 --> 01:18:48,355
Okay.

1798
01:18:51,727 --> 01:18:56,530
What if we actually put
the food before the fanfare?

1799
01:18:56,565 --> 01:18:58,833
What if we went back
to a simpler time

1800
01:18:58,867 --> 01:19:02,570
when people ate at restaurants
where the food is fresh,

1801
01:19:02,604 --> 01:19:04,438
not frozen?

1802
01:19:04,473 --> 01:19:05,973
And grown locally,

1803
01:19:06,007 --> 01:19:09,510
not trucked across country
in big bags and cans?

1804
01:19:09,544 --> 01:19:13,047
Where locals, like lucien,

1805
01:19:13,081 --> 01:19:16,584
are as creative
as the top chefs in Atlanta,

1806
01:19:16,618 --> 01:19:19,954
where Clay, the owner,

1807
01:19:19,988 --> 01:19:23,624
has come up with a way to use
the mineral-rich spring water,

1808
01:19:23,658 --> 01:19:25,593
something no one else is doing,

1809
01:19:25,627 --> 01:19:28,596
to cook in the kitchen
and irrigate the garden.

1810
01:19:28,630 --> 01:19:30,598
He's a forward-thinker,

1811
01:19:30,632 --> 01:19:31,599
who's been coming up with

1812
01:19:31,633 --> 01:19:33,734
environmentally
sustainable concepts

1813
01:19:33,802 --> 01:19:34,769
for years now.

1814
01:19:34,803 --> 01:19:37,004
What if we went back to a time,

1815
01:19:37,038 --> 01:19:41,642
where people actually talked
while they ate?

1816
01:19:41,676 --> 01:19:43,711
Where pictures
of little league teams

1817
01:19:43,745 --> 01:19:44,712
were on the wall,

1818
01:19:44,746 --> 01:19:46,781
instead of
relentless advertising

1819
01:19:46,815 --> 01:19:48,649
and 60-inch tvs.

1820
01:19:48,683 --> 01:19:50,618
The old hart's

1821
01:19:50,652 --> 01:19:53,721
is the new idea
you're missing out on.

1822
01:19:53,755 --> 01:19:56,657
We don't need
to re-brand hart's, sir.

1823
01:19:56,691 --> 01:20:01,428
We should be using hart's
to re-brand icb.

1824
01:20:11,640 --> 01:20:13,674
<i>Hey, it's Clay,</i>
<i>you know what to do.</i>

1825
01:20:13,708 --> 01:20:14,775
Hi, Clay.

1826
01:20:14,810 --> 01:20:17,912
It's Willy.

1827
01:20:17,946 --> 01:20:21,615
I'm sure you don't want to
ever talk to me again,

1828
01:20:21,650 --> 01:20:23,717
so I'll make this short.

1829
01:20:24,820 --> 01:20:26,821
Somehow, I managed
to convince icb

1830
01:20:26,855 --> 01:20:28,722
to change the entire concept

1831
01:20:28,757 --> 01:20:29,857
back to what you
and lucien were doing

1832
01:20:29,891 --> 01:20:35,362
before I showed up
and made a mess of everything.

1833
01:20:35,397 --> 01:20:37,131
And I understand

1834
01:20:37,165 --> 01:20:41,635
if it doesn't change
what you think of me.

1835
01:20:41,670 --> 01:20:43,804
I mean, honestly,

1836
01:20:43,839 --> 01:20:45,706
I don't even know
what to think of me anymore,

1837
01:20:45,740 --> 01:20:46,907
but I'm sorry...

1838
01:20:50,312 --> 01:20:51,278
Hello?

1839
01:20:51,313 --> 01:20:52,079
Hi.

1840
01:20:52,113 --> 01:20:55,583
I was just
leaving you a message.

1841
01:20:55,617 --> 01:20:57,451
What were you saying?

1842
01:20:58,153 --> 01:21:00,654
You should probably
just listen to it yourself.

1843
01:21:00,689 --> 01:21:02,723
Why don't you
tell me in person?

1844
01:21:02,757 --> 01:21:04,658
What?

1845
01:21:04,693 --> 01:21:07,228
Turn around.

1846
01:21:07,762 --> 01:21:09,897
What are you doing here?

1847
01:21:09,931 --> 01:21:14,368
I guess I just wanted to see
what it was you left me for.

1848
01:21:15,670 --> 01:21:16,837
And you're right,

1849
01:21:16,872 --> 01:21:18,706
this city, it's...

1850
01:21:18,740 --> 01:21:20,241
Beautiful.

1851
01:21:21,643 --> 01:21:24,745
Clay, I know it doesn't
make up for

1852
01:21:24,779 --> 01:21:26,547
all the pain I've caused you,

1853
01:21:26,581 --> 01:21:29,650
but there's good news.

1854
01:21:29,684 --> 01:21:31,352
You're going to get
your business back.

1855
01:21:31,386 --> 01:21:33,487
I love you.

1856
01:21:35,657 --> 01:21:39,693
I've loved you
ever since I can remember.

1857
01:21:39,728 --> 01:21:41,929
Go or stay,
it doesn't matter.

1858
01:21:41,963 --> 01:21:44,465
I just want
to be with you.

1859
01:21:44,499 --> 01:21:47,635
I'm tired of wondering

1860
01:21:47,669 --> 01:21:48,702
what my life
would have looked like

1861
01:21:48,737 --> 01:21:52,239
if I had done this
15 years ago...

1862
01:21:55,677 --> 01:21:59,380
Willy Jones...

1863
01:22:01,583 --> 01:22:04,351
Will you marry me?

1864
01:22:07,289 --> 01:22:08,289
Yes.

1865
01:22:10,725 --> 01:22:13,394
Yes!

1866
01:22:37,452 --> 01:22:38,686
Bon appetit.

1867
01:22:46,861 --> 01:22:48,696
We're back to
officially being

1868
01:22:48,730 --> 01:22:50,965
a mom and pop restaurant.

1869
01:22:50,999 --> 01:22:54,368
Well, it's gonna take
at least nine months

1870
01:22:54,402 --> 01:22:56,370
to make it official.

1871
01:23:00,875 --> 01:23:04,645
Happy Valentine's day,
Mr. hart.

1872
01:23:04,679 --> 01:23:06,647
Happy Valentine's day,
Mrs. hart.
