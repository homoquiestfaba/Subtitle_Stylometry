1
00:00:44,479 --> 00:00:48,048
We should get a couple of shots and you
can get in like the side or something.

2
00:00:54,358 --> 00:00:55,968
Marcos De Niza?

3
00:01:04,238 --> 00:01:05,239
Who do you think made it?

4
00:01:07,197 --> 00:01:08,590
No, no, no, no, no!

5
00:01:09,721 --> 00:01:10,896
Oh, fuck!

6
00:01:26,782 --> 00:01:29,654
No!

7
00:01:36,226 --> 00:01:37,445
<i>This is 58.</i>

8
00:01:37,575 --> 00:01:38,596
<i>I'm gonna need an ambulance.</i>

9
00:01:38,620 --> 00:01:40,491
<i>I have a multiple 10-53.</i>

10
00:01:40,622 --> 00:01:42,493
<i>Suspect is heading west,</i>

11
00:01:42,624 --> 00:01:44,495
<i>he is a Hispanic male.</i>

12
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:48,543
<i>47-54.
Until we get the guy in custody,</i>

13
00:01:48,673 --> 00:01:51,502
<i>keep it going Code 3
until we get an update.</i>

14
00:03:32,516 --> 00:03:36,738
<i>All my years
given to this, to them.</i>

15
00:03:36,868 --> 00:03:39,784
<i>You know my heart, my family,</i>

16
00:03:39,915 --> 00:03:42,787
<i>generations of proud trackers.</i>

17
00:03:47,009 --> 00:03:50,839
Thank you for coming in
on such short notice, Mister...

18
00:03:50,969 --> 00:03:51,969
Monteenz?

19
00:03:52,797 --> 00:03:53,797
Montenez.

20
00:03:54,843 --> 00:03:56,714
Is that Mexican?

21
00:03:56,845 --> 00:03:57,845
Are you Mexican?

22
00:03:59,413 --> 00:04:03,243
No. Pascua Yaqui and Meskwaki.

23
00:04:04,374 --> 00:04:06,289
I don't fuck around.

24
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:10,598
Excuse me? Why isn't that on?

25
00:04:10,728 --> 00:04:12,730
That goes on
once we're straight.

26
00:04:13,731 --> 00:04:14,731
About?

27
00:04:16,734 --> 00:04:18,780
This could be big or small, Ed.

28
00:04:18,910 --> 00:04:20,390
A person like me doesn't show up

29
00:04:20,521 --> 00:04:23,175
unless
Washington thinks shit's bad.

30
00:04:23,306 --> 00:04:25,134
And in your neck of the woods.

31
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:26,570
Or neck of the desert.

32
00:04:28,703 --> 00:04:33,925
Well, between you and me, this half-breed
indigenous character you've concocted,

33
00:04:34,056 --> 00:04:35,056
doesn't work.

34
00:04:36,058 --> 00:04:38,582
You've been dirty
since the Shadow Wolves, Ed.

35
00:04:40,410 --> 00:04:42,325
Keep that name
out of your mouth.

36
00:04:44,371 --> 00:04:45,633
There it is.

37
00:04:46,677 --> 00:04:48,897
That hot streak they spoke of.

38
00:04:54,816 --> 00:04:59,864
This is case number 1-0-3-3-6-9.

39
00:04:59,995 --> 00:05:02,519
The questioning of Ed Montenez.

40
00:05:03,781 --> 00:05:07,176
Thank you, Agent Montenez,
for coming in and good morning.

41
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:09,918
Now, it says here that
you spoke with Agent Christy

42
00:05:10,048 --> 00:05:13,791
and you heard gunfire
the day of August 21st?

43
00:05:53,875 --> 00:05:54,875
Diablito.

44
00:05:58,401 --> 00:05:59,794
You left me, ese.

45
00:06:15,766 --> 00:06:16,766
No?

46
00:06:25,254 --> 00:06:27,735
Hey, real talk, homie.
We gotta get the fuck out of here, man.

47
00:06:28,692 --> 00:06:31,347
You left me, ese!

48
00:06:31,478 --> 00:06:32,957
You fucking left me.

49
00:06:46,014 --> 00:06:47,557
Get that fucking
<i>cuete</i> out of my face, dog.

50
00:06:47,581 --> 00:06:48,688
It's not what you think, eh.

51
00:06:48,712 --> 00:06:50,410
You left me, ese!

52
00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:52,540
- You fucking...
- It's not what you fucking think!

53
00:06:54,588 --> 00:06:55,850
You did steal from there!

54
00:06:55,980 --> 00:06:56,980
You left me!

55
00:07:15,826 --> 00:07:16,826
Fuck!

56
00:07:39,763 --> 00:07:42,636
Gordo's fucking up, ese.

57
00:07:42,766 --> 00:07:45,465
Gordo's a dead fucking bitch.

58
00:07:55,083 --> 00:07:56,476
I wanna tell you something

59
00:07:56,606 --> 00:07:58,826
but don't trip, ese.

60
00:07:58,956 --> 00:08:00,116
What do you mean, don't trip?

61
00:08:05,746 --> 00:08:08,836
Huh. I had this
dream the other night.

62
00:08:09,793 --> 00:08:11,839
Actually,
I've had it a couple of times.

63
00:08:13,623 --> 00:08:14,711
You and me

64
00:08:14,842 --> 00:08:16,017
running from the Negra.

65
00:08:18,759 --> 00:08:19,803
We go in to hide,

66
00:08:21,065 --> 00:08:22,065
I turn around

67
00:08:23,677 --> 00:08:25,679
and boom, I get shot, ese.

68
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:27,724
The trippy shit is,

69
00:08:28,638 --> 00:08:30,118
instead of helping me,

70
00:08:30,248 --> 00:08:32,337
you strangle me, ese.

71
00:08:32,468 --> 00:08:33,468
Man.

72
00:08:37,734 --> 00:08:39,606
Maybe you were
just trying to help me

73
00:08:39,736 --> 00:08:42,043
so I could
fucking beat Chief Alvarez

74
00:08:42,173 --> 00:08:44,393
for putting me back in <i>la pinta.</i>

75
00:08:49,180 --> 00:08:52,749
Or maybe you were sending
me to <i>mi madre en el cielo.</i>

76
00:08:53,445 --> 00:08:55,099
It could be the message, bro.

77
00:09:05,893 --> 00:09:07,721
You're a trip.

78
00:09:21,865 --> 00:09:23,737
He's not answering his radio.

79
00:09:24,738 --> 00:09:25,869
Maybe he turned it off.

80
00:09:27,784 --> 00:09:29,656
You up for a run?

81
00:09:29,786 --> 00:09:31,306
No, dude,
we gotta lay low for a while.

82
00:09:33,268 --> 00:09:35,139
Why do you guys need to lay low?

83
00:09:38,012 --> 00:09:40,101
Fuck the crooked law.

84
00:09:40,231 --> 00:09:42,582
Well, I sure am glad we
have your blessing, honey.

85
00:09:42,712 --> 00:09:43,713
Thank you.

86
00:09:45,715 --> 00:09:46,803
Look, we're fine.

87
00:09:48,109 --> 00:09:50,677
Even if there
was a remote chance.

88
00:09:50,807 --> 00:09:51,915
I mean,
it's like a fucking war zone

89
00:09:51,939 --> 00:09:53,157
out there right now, man.

90
00:09:54,681 --> 00:09:56,813
For all they know,
it's cartel shit.

91
00:10:02,166 --> 00:10:03,166
Alright.

92
00:10:06,867 --> 00:10:08,172
Let's do this.

93
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,089
<i>Battery suspect
is at 318 East 3rd Street.</i>

94
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:15,266
<i>Is that related to your call or
do you want a different patrol unit?</i>

95
00:11:22,464 --> 00:11:23,247
You hear that?

96
00:11:23,378 --> 00:11:24,814
10-46.

97
00:11:25,815 --> 00:11:27,034
He ain't helping nobody.

98
00:11:28,644 --> 00:11:31,124
I'm telling you, that crooked Indian's
working with the cartel.

99
00:11:34,781 --> 00:11:36,826
Let's head over
to the south peak.

100
00:11:36,957 --> 00:11:37,958
Roger that.

101
00:12:46,853 --> 00:12:48,898
This is high-powered.

102
00:12:50,421 --> 00:12:52,293
Maybe the cartel
shot their falcon.

103
00:12:54,817 --> 00:12:56,253
Yeah, well we better move on.

104
00:12:58,081 --> 00:12:59,779
Unless you want to call it in.

105
00:13:01,737 --> 00:13:03,217
No, thanks.

106
00:13:03,347 --> 00:13:05,741
This is that devil
idiot from the truck.

107
00:13:05,872 --> 00:13:07,395
And those are
your bullets in him.

108
00:13:11,094 --> 00:13:12,313
Let's get out of here.

109
00:13:16,230 --> 00:13:17,230
Coyote!

110
00:15:05,643 --> 00:15:09,082
- Hey, Willy.
- Ed.

111
00:15:09,212 --> 00:15:11,214
It's gonna be coming
in next couple of days.

112
00:15:12,215 --> 00:15:14,000
Be like a moving truck.

113
00:15:15,262 --> 00:15:17,351
It gets really
hot in them trucks.

114
00:15:17,481 --> 00:15:18,482
Sure does.

115
00:15:19,222 --> 00:15:21,355
It's gonna be
in a green backpack.

116
00:15:23,052 --> 00:15:24,358
Laters.

117
00:15:24,488 --> 00:15:25,488
Later, Willy.

118
00:16:02,657 --> 00:16:03,657
Shut the fuck up!

119
00:16:04,702 --> 00:16:05,702
Fuck!

120
00:16:05,747 --> 00:16:07,009
Calm down, ese!

121
00:16:08,010 --> 00:16:09,969
Calm down?

122
00:16:10,099 --> 00:16:13,102
<i>La pinta</i> made you soft
ever since you came out.

123
00:16:15,061 --> 00:16:16,061
And that hair.

124
00:16:17,150 --> 00:16:18,301
When're you gonna cut that shit?

125
00:16:18,325 --> 00:16:19,848
You look like a.

126
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:21,371
Man, shit the fuck up, man.

127
00:16:29,597 --> 00:16:31,468
Just pay attention
to what you're doing, ese.

128
00:16:31,599 --> 00:16:33,427
We're almost there.

129
00:16:57,146 --> 00:16:58,321
<i>This is my time.</i>

130
00:17:12,596 --> 00:17:15,991
I think we need to start covering
this stretch, right there.

131
00:17:16,122 --> 00:17:18,254
That's where they're
bringing the trucks through.

132
00:17:18,385 --> 00:17:21,170
- Yeah, that would explain the tracks.
- Yeah, well just last week

133
00:17:21,301 --> 00:17:24,217
they found a broken down
moving truck over by Lo Keyo.

134
00:17:30,484 --> 00:17:35,532
Well, hell. I sure am glad you decided to
stick around, Max. I really appreciate it.

135
00:17:35,663 --> 00:17:37,969
I believe in the good fight,
you know that.

136
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:39,145
Yes, you do.

137
00:17:41,364 --> 00:17:43,279
Babe, Ed's here.

138
00:17:44,628 --> 00:17:47,022
Shit, you didn't
let him in, did you?

139
00:17:47,153 --> 00:17:51,070
No, he's out front. Said he'd seen some
coyotes over by the livestock.

140
00:17:51,766 --> 00:17:52,766
Yeah right.

141
00:17:53,855 --> 00:17:56,510
Alright, stay right here,
I'll go take care of this.

142
00:18:01,341 --> 00:18:02,603
Hey there, Ed.

143
00:18:03,517 --> 00:18:05,562
This is a mighty
old man you got here.

144
00:18:07,521 --> 00:18:09,349
Yeah, that's a big one.

145
00:18:09,479 --> 00:18:11,568
All those years
to make it that big.

146
00:18:12,874 --> 00:18:14,180
Yeah, long time.

147
00:18:20,316 --> 00:18:21,554
I just wanted to
come by and say thank you

148
00:18:21,578 --> 00:18:23,754
for honoring our agreement.

149
00:18:24,668 --> 00:18:27,062
Yeah, so there isn't
even any coyotes on my land

150
00:18:27,193 --> 00:18:28,542
right now, is there?

151
00:18:28,672 --> 00:18:30,239
I didn't know if Lily knew.

152
00:18:30,370 --> 00:18:31,675
Sure enough.

153
00:18:31,806 --> 00:18:33,503
Always working the angles, huh?

154
00:18:34,548 --> 00:18:36,158
Not much to agree to.

155
00:18:37,290 --> 00:18:39,553
You ran most of
my people off, Ed.

156
00:18:39,683 --> 00:18:40,684
The law did.

157
00:18:41,685 --> 00:18:44,210
An officer was shot, Travis.

158
00:18:44,906 --> 00:18:45,906
Did you forget?

159
00:18:47,126 --> 00:18:48,301
It was an accident.

160
00:18:48,431 --> 00:18:50,129
Kinda easy to forget, you know?

161
00:18:53,697 --> 00:18:56,265
You can't run the law
in your own hands anymore.

162
00:18:58,180 --> 00:19:00,313
So it's the law
that's talking to me now, is that it?

163
00:19:01,836 --> 00:19:03,403
They're watching you, Travis.

164
00:19:04,447 --> 00:19:06,362
Once more and you go to prison.

165
00:19:06,493 --> 00:19:08,408
Away for a long time.

166
00:19:13,326 --> 00:19:16,198
I saw some coyotes by your
heffers about a half mile up.

167
00:19:16,329 --> 00:19:19,332
So what is it then?
Are you here to tell me about some coyotes?

168
00:19:19,462 --> 00:19:20,724
Are you feeling a little guilty

169
00:19:20,855 --> 00:19:22,683
or are you just
here to sniff around

170
00:19:22,813 --> 00:19:25,207
like some sort
of fucking law dog?

171
00:19:25,338 --> 00:19:28,819
We used to be friends back then,
before this border shit.

172
00:19:29,603 --> 00:19:32,040
Yeah, that was a long time ago.

173
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:33,389
Way back in high school.

174
00:19:34,869 --> 00:19:36,653
Now you're just an acquaintance.

175
00:19:37,611 --> 00:19:39,874
I'm sorry you feel that way.

176
00:19:40,004 --> 00:19:42,287
You know, you and your people
have been walking across the border

177
00:19:42,311 --> 00:19:45,619
back and forth from here to
Mexico for a real long time.

178
00:19:46,576 --> 00:19:50,667
Yes, for thousands of years,
all the way to the ocean.

179
00:19:50,798 --> 00:19:52,515
Well it's a shame all that's
about to come to an end

180
00:19:52,539 --> 00:19:54,149
once they put that wall up.

181
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:55,542
Huh?

182
00:19:55,672 --> 00:19:57,196
Be careful, Travis.

183
00:19:58,153 --> 00:19:59,198
Oh, I will.

184
00:20:00,547 --> 00:20:02,026
And until they put that wall up,

185
00:20:02,157 --> 00:20:03,811
you know I'll be here
defending my land.

186
00:20:06,335 --> 00:20:07,380
That's my right.

187
00:20:08,816 --> 00:20:10,209
And you know it.

188
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:40,674
Were you going to shoot Ed?

189
00:23:45,859 --> 00:23:47,991
So how long have you
been working the border?

190
00:23:48,122 --> 00:23:49,776
23 years, agent.

191
00:23:51,038 --> 00:23:54,345
They let you keep
the hair and the braids?

192
00:23:55,346 --> 00:23:57,784
Years ago they did a study
on native trackers.

193
00:23:57,914 --> 00:23:59,655
Yeah, I've heard this one.

194
00:23:59,786 --> 00:24:01,440
They took a bunch
of Native Americans

195
00:24:01,570 --> 00:24:03,746
and they cut off all
their hair and all of a sudden

196
00:24:03,877 --> 00:24:06,140
they were confused
and couldn't find shit.

197
00:24:07,271 --> 00:24:10,840
But the fellow with the
hair always found his shit.

198
00:24:20,241 --> 00:24:21,590
It's beautiful here.

199
00:24:24,201 --> 00:24:25,594
It beats shoveling shit.

200
00:24:28,118 --> 00:24:31,470
You know, I wake up in
the mornings these days,

201
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:32,645
no more pain.

202
00:24:37,911 --> 00:24:39,042
So how's your husband?

203
00:24:40,566 --> 00:24:41,654
Larry.

204
00:24:42,785 --> 00:24:44,483
Yeah, he's my boyfriend.

205
00:24:44,613 --> 00:24:45,614
He's fine.

206
00:24:47,660 --> 00:24:48,878
It's been a little tough.

207
00:24:50,750 --> 00:24:53,492
Yeah. Hopefully this
will make things better.

208
00:24:54,623 --> 00:24:55,624
Hopefully.

209
00:24:59,672 --> 00:25:01,412
Package will be
there in two days.

210
00:25:02,805 --> 00:25:06,287
But you might need a little
assistance getting it over.

211
00:25:06,417 --> 00:25:08,811
Things are a lot
more difficult right now.

212
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:11,814
I can arrange for something.

213
00:25:12,815 --> 00:25:14,034
I have planned for this.

214
00:25:16,863 --> 00:25:17,863
Thank you, Sid.

215
00:25:19,648 --> 00:25:20,649
No sweat, kid.

216
00:25:22,651 --> 00:25:23,739
If it wasn't for you,

217
00:25:25,915 --> 00:25:28,701
I'd be a retired
addict right about now.

218
00:26:13,659 --> 00:26:16,618
I see the tracks
coming in, but where the fuck do they go?

219
00:26:16,749 --> 00:26:19,839
They're probably using
carpet on their fucking feet.

220
00:26:19,969 --> 00:26:22,058
But I see two
of them right there.

221
00:26:44,777 --> 00:26:47,649
Run, motherfucker!

222
00:27:04,666 --> 00:27:05,928
Money!

223
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:08,975
Shut up! Get down!

224
00:27:09,105 --> 00:27:12,631
I have money! Money! Money!

225
00:27:12,761 --> 00:27:13,761
Stay down!

226
00:27:15,068 --> 00:27:16,262
I don't want your
fucking money, shut up!

227
00:27:16,286 --> 00:27:17,070
No shoot!

228
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:17,810
No shoot!

229
00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:20,116
My... my heart!

230
00:27:30,083 --> 00:27:31,083
My heart!

231
00:27:32,389 --> 00:27:33,695
My heart!

232
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:35,740
Yeah?

233
00:27:36,655 --> 00:27:39,135
Well, I've got
something for your heart.

234
00:27:39,266 --> 00:27:40,746
You fake fuck!

235
00:27:41,964 --> 00:27:43,705
Get on your knees.

236
00:27:49,885 --> 00:27:53,019
Can you believe this fucking
kraut tried to pay us off?

237
00:27:56,283 --> 00:27:59,286
Why the hell would a German want
to sneak across here anyway?

238
00:27:59,416 --> 00:28:02,202
It's been awhile
since we caught a Euro.

239
00:28:02,332 --> 00:28:06,510
Yeah. Why don't you ask the
Mexican where the others went

240
00:28:06,641 --> 00:28:09,252
and why the hell he's
hanging out with this guy?

241
00:28:09,383 --> 00:28:10,383
Hey!

242
00:28:33,233 --> 00:28:34,233
My friend.

243
00:28:35,017 --> 00:28:36,932
He wants water too.

244
00:28:37,063 --> 00:28:39,369
Did you hear that?

245
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:41,197
I heard that.

246
00:28:41,328 --> 00:28:43,983
He understands
exactly what we're saying.

247
00:28:44,113 --> 00:28:46,246
Why the fuck are you so guilty?!

248
00:28:47,247 --> 00:28:48,378
Hey, hey, hey, it's cool.

249
00:28:48,509 --> 00:28:49,597
They're just thirsty.

250
00:28:51,207 --> 00:28:54,123
We're just two honest guys
going to America to work, ese.

251
00:28:55,298 --> 00:28:57,039
Ese.

252
00:28:57,170 --> 00:29:00,042
Two honest guys
trying to work, my ass!

253
00:29:00,173 --> 00:29:02,001
You're a fucking coyote!

254
00:29:02,131 --> 00:29:04,699
Try to tell me you're not, motherfucker!

255
00:29:04,830 --> 00:29:07,397
You're the coyote and
this bastard is the one

256
00:29:07,528 --> 00:29:09,138
that's paying you off!

257
00:29:10,661 --> 00:29:12,359
What the hell's
wrong with this guy?

258
00:29:15,275 --> 00:29:17,930
Jesus Christ, he's having
a heart attack or some shit.

259
00:29:19,583 --> 00:29:20,628
Should I cut him loose?

260
00:29:20,759 --> 00:29:21,759
Hell no.

261
00:29:21,847 --> 00:29:22,848
No!

262
00:29:29,985 --> 00:29:32,074
He's fucking dead, Travis!

263
00:29:36,078 --> 00:29:38,167
I never knew I was that scary.

264
00:29:42,911 --> 00:29:45,044
Now this is the
second day in a row

265
00:29:45,174 --> 00:29:48,787
we've been stuck on
some stupid shit out here.

266
00:29:48,917 --> 00:29:50,223
It's probably not even on today.

267
00:29:50,353 --> 00:29:52,616
And what the fuck
does it matter anyway?

268
00:29:52,747 --> 00:29:53,966
That guy might live.

269
00:29:57,186 --> 00:29:58,685
Give me the phone
and I'll make the call!

270
00:29:58,709 --> 00:29:59,709
Hey!

271
00:30:00,711 --> 00:30:03,366
Cut me loose. We have ten grand
right there, ese.

272
00:30:03,932 --> 00:30:05,020
I'll go home and go to bed.

273
00:30:05,151 --> 00:30:07,196
Perfect fucking English.

274
00:30:09,198 --> 00:30:10,198
Hey.

275
00:30:11,374 --> 00:30:12,898
You guys are those motherfuckers

276
00:30:13,028 --> 00:30:15,117
that killed that
border agent, aren't you?

277
00:30:17,816 --> 00:30:20,383
No, that wasn't us. Why don't
you shut your trap, boy?

278
00:30:22,298 --> 00:30:23,822
Travis!

279
00:30:23,952 --> 00:30:26,346
I can't handle any more
of this bullshit out here!

280
00:30:26,476 --> 00:30:28,478
Yeah, well we can't
afford to call this in either,

281
00:30:28,609 --> 00:30:31,351
otherwise that's the end
of protecting all this shit!

282
00:30:31,481 --> 00:30:33,361
We might as well cut
him loose and call it a day

283
00:30:33,396 --> 00:30:36,051
so we can all go back to bed!

284
00:30:36,182 --> 00:30:38,358
That other one's
probably a cho-mo anyway.

285
00:30:46,932 --> 00:30:48,368
You know,

286
00:30:48,498 --> 00:30:51,066
I know where you come from, man.

287
00:30:51,197 --> 00:30:53,286
They say you can
take either the silver

288
00:30:55,114 --> 00:30:56,114
or the bullet.

289
00:30:58,247 --> 00:30:59,988
I might be a lot of things,

290
00:31:00,119 --> 00:31:03,165
but I sure as hell
ain't no coyote's bitch.

291
00:31:07,169 --> 00:31:09,868
Just another stupid
American wasting money.

292
00:31:09,998 --> 00:31:10,999
Cut me loose!

293
00:31:12,522 --> 00:31:13,522
Stand up.

294
00:31:15,482 --> 00:31:16,875
I said stand up!

295
00:31:17,005 --> 00:31:18,050
Get the fuck up!

296
00:31:18,180 --> 00:31:19,878
Travis! Cut him loose!

297
00:31:20,008 --> 00:31:21,836
Travis!

298
00:31:21,967 --> 00:31:23,142
Just cut him loose!

299
00:31:26,145 --> 00:31:27,189
Run, motherfucker!

300
00:31:33,021 --> 00:31:34,805
Very unnecessary.

301
00:31:34,936 --> 00:31:36,068
All of this shit!

302
00:31:37,199 --> 00:31:39,158
Very unnecessary!

303
00:31:45,381 --> 00:31:46,992
Take a look at this, Ed.

304
00:31:48,907 --> 00:31:50,038
Do you know these guys?

305
00:31:52,171 --> 00:31:53,476
Local border watchers.

306
00:31:53,607 --> 00:31:54,738
Militia men.

307
00:31:54,869 --> 00:31:55,914
Not dirty.

308
00:31:57,132 --> 00:31:59,221
I didn't ask if
they were dirty, Ed.

309
00:32:02,659 --> 00:32:03,922
The guy on the left,

310
00:32:04,052 --> 00:32:06,489
he's my friend, Travis Hunter.

311
00:32:06,620 --> 00:32:09,405
He's a good man,
but a little mixed-up.

312
00:32:10,885 --> 00:32:12,539
Mixed-up how?

313
00:32:14,367 --> 00:32:16,108
Takes everything to heart.

314
00:32:16,238 --> 00:32:17,674
Prefers to react.

315
00:32:18,545 --> 00:32:21,461
He seems like he's
always around when shit happens.

316
00:32:21,591 --> 00:32:23,898
What's that got to do with me?

317
00:32:24,029 --> 00:32:27,815
Well, Washington got
wind of a vigilante militia,

318
00:32:27,946 --> 00:32:29,512
killing illegals.

319
00:32:29,643 --> 00:32:34,169
Maybe the same ones who shot
that border agent last summer.

320
00:32:34,300 --> 00:32:36,084
There's a lot
of groups out here.

321
00:32:38,739 --> 00:32:40,959
And then there's this.

322
00:32:42,090 --> 00:32:43,918
Hans Ferguson.

323
00:32:44,049 --> 00:32:47,008
German software
tycoon found dead.

324
00:32:47,139 --> 00:32:48,357
Wanted by Interpol.

325
00:32:52,666 --> 00:32:53,972
What did he do?

326
00:32:56,191 --> 00:32:57,279
Pedophile.

327
00:32:59,064 --> 00:33:02,241
Peddling child porn
across the EU.

328
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:05,157
I reported this body.

329
00:33:05,287 --> 00:33:06,375
I'm aware of it.

330
00:33:07,376 --> 00:33:09,596
Yeah, I bet you are aware of it.

331
00:33:09,726 --> 00:33:12,425
But you're real intimate
with the details as well, huh?

332
00:33:13,730 --> 00:33:15,123
Covering for your buddy?

333
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:21,537
What the fuck?!

334
00:34:22,756 --> 00:34:24,279
We almost had one!

335
00:34:24,410 --> 00:34:26,586
He had a pack of
shit on his back, Ed!

336
00:34:26,716 --> 00:34:29,023
I can't have you
running down people, Travis!

337
00:34:29,154 --> 00:34:30,546
Don't make me
fucking lock you up!

338
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:33,636
What did you say to me?

339
00:34:33,767 --> 00:34:35,725
Travis! No!

340
00:34:35,856 --> 00:34:38,902
You ain't locking me up
for hunting these animals down!

341
00:34:39,033 --> 00:34:41,209
They're the ones
that are breaking the law!

342
00:34:42,471 --> 00:34:44,343
I ain't turning around, Travis!

343
00:34:45,692 --> 00:34:47,563
This ain't your first
speaking now, Travis!

344
00:34:48,651 --> 00:34:50,218
Don't make me turn around!

345
00:34:54,004 --> 00:34:56,355
You boys come up
on any moving trucks?

346
00:34:57,791 --> 00:35:01,316
Nope. We've been on
that coyote since daybreak.

347
00:35:01,447 --> 00:35:03,188
I thought you would say that.

348
00:35:11,370 --> 00:35:13,067
He knows we were there.

349
00:35:13,198 --> 00:35:14,199
He don't know shit.

350
00:35:15,069 --> 00:35:16,723
He can keep
stumbling around in the dark

351
00:35:16,853 --> 00:35:18,116
for all I give a fuck.

352
00:35:19,247 --> 00:35:20,422
He's got you paranoid.

353
00:35:22,424 --> 00:35:25,340
I ain't scared of him,
but I do respect him.

354
00:35:25,471 --> 00:35:26,602
He can smell bullshit.

355
00:35:55,196 --> 00:35:57,764
You know what I was thinking?

356
00:35:57,894 --> 00:35:59,635
Back there
I could've sworn I heard a baby.

357
00:35:59,766 --> 00:36:02,116
- Crying.
- Yeah.

358
00:36:02,247 --> 00:36:05,467
- Yeah, me too.
- Like there was a few of them

359
00:36:05,598 --> 00:36:07,774
hiding back there in
the bushes when we ran by.

360
00:36:10,690 --> 00:36:12,344
That guy did look familiar.

361
00:36:15,347 --> 00:36:17,542
I don't know about him, but that
pack he had on his backside

362
00:36:17,566 --> 00:36:19,525
sure looked like
the one from the truck.

363
00:36:21,788 --> 00:36:24,704
Wanna head back, flank him?

364
00:36:24,834 --> 00:36:26,271
Yep.

365
00:38:04,673 --> 00:38:07,459
I can tell
you don't like me, Ed.

366
00:38:07,589 --> 00:38:09,722
I'm sure you get that a lot.

367
00:38:09,852 --> 00:38:12,681
Yes, I do in my line of work.

368
00:38:12,812 --> 00:38:15,293
Being gender deficient
in a man's game.

369
00:38:16,685 --> 00:38:18,252
But you know what?

370
00:38:18,383 --> 00:38:19,427
What?

371
00:38:20,385 --> 00:38:21,603
I don't give a fuck.

372
00:38:25,346 --> 00:38:27,261
Alright,
now back to the real what.

373
00:38:28,262 --> 00:38:29,959
I think I have an idea
as to why you quit

374
00:38:30,090 --> 00:38:32,614
such a prestigious outfit
like the Shadow Wolves.

375
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:36,923
- It's because you were broke.
- Really?

376
00:38:38,011 --> 00:38:39,534
Two divorces.

377
00:38:39,665 --> 00:38:40,666
Headed for a third.

378
00:38:42,494 --> 00:38:43,930
Gotta make it happen this time.

379
00:38:47,237 --> 00:38:48,717
Yeah.

380
00:38:48,848 --> 00:38:51,633
The action wasn't
happening down on the res,

381
00:38:53,331 --> 00:38:54,810
so you had to go find it.

382
00:38:56,551 --> 00:38:59,946
I left the res because
it wasn't what I grew up with.

383
00:39:00,076 --> 00:39:01,339
It changed.

384
00:39:02,514 --> 00:39:04,603
Or maybe you changed, Ed.

385
00:39:06,387 --> 00:39:08,520
When you set out to hunt a man

386
00:39:08,650 --> 00:39:11,914
you better be prepared, agent.

387
00:39:12,045 --> 00:39:13,045
Excuse me?

388
00:39:14,482 --> 00:39:18,530
Hunting a being is
about connecting to the root.

389
00:41:08,857 --> 00:41:09,857
Damn it.

390
00:41:10,772 --> 00:41:13,558
He's blinding me over here.

391
00:41:13,688 --> 00:41:15,560
I told you to go home, Travis.

392
00:41:15,690 --> 00:41:17,605
What the fuck
are you doing, Travis?

393
00:41:17,736 --> 00:41:19,477
You're gonna shoot Ed?

394
00:41:19,607 --> 00:41:20,652
Just glancing him.

395
00:41:21,914 --> 00:41:23,655
What the fuck are we doing?

396
00:41:23,785 --> 00:41:25,613
Well, the fact is,

397
00:41:25,744 --> 00:41:26,962
we fucked up,

398
00:41:28,616 --> 00:41:30,705
so we can either
go down for that shit

399
00:41:30,836 --> 00:41:32,620
or we can try to
remedy the situation.

400
00:41:34,230 --> 00:41:36,972
That all starts
with following these two.

401
00:41:42,587 --> 00:41:44,763
You know, Travis,
I believe in this,

402
00:41:44,893 --> 00:41:47,853
but that, this,
this fucking scheming?

403
00:41:47,983 --> 00:41:48,983
Fuck!

404
00:41:50,943 --> 00:41:52,703
All my time in the service,
I never did shit.

405
00:41:52,814 --> 00:41:54,076
I never killed a civilian.

406
00:41:56,296 --> 00:41:57,819
Not up until now.

407
00:42:05,131 --> 00:42:07,612
This is Pepper Charles
reporting on the border

408
00:42:07,742 --> 00:42:10,310
at Hunter Ranch
with Travis Hunter.

409
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:13,182
Mr. Hunter,
it has been said by you

410
00:42:13,313 --> 00:42:16,490
that illegal immigrants
are entering our country

411
00:42:16,621 --> 00:42:18,013
to vote Democratic.

412
00:42:18,144 --> 00:42:20,581
Do you have any
evidence to back this up?

413
00:42:20,712 --> 00:42:23,192
Well I find it ironic that
you refer to them as immigrants

414
00:42:23,323 --> 00:42:25,455
while they're actually
criminals that cross over here

415
00:42:25,586 --> 00:42:28,981
by the millions and
cast votes for liberals.

416
00:42:29,111 --> 00:42:31,636
And do you have any facts
to support that claim?

417
00:42:31,766 --> 00:42:33,206
Well, I know what
you're trying to do

418
00:42:33,333 --> 00:42:35,422
and the only thing
you're actually accomplishing

419
00:42:35,553 --> 00:42:37,859
is showing the Americans
that you can make a mockery

420
00:42:37,990 --> 00:42:39,687
of a true patriot.

421
00:42:39,818 --> 00:42:41,036
It's kind of shameful.

422
00:42:42,037 --> 00:42:44,126
If what you're saying were true,

423
00:42:44,257 --> 00:42:48,478
how does a non-citizen get past
identification verifications

424
00:42:48,609 --> 00:42:51,307
and other measures
to prevent voter fraud?

425
00:42:51,438 --> 00:42:54,659
And why would they
put themselves in unnecessary jeopardy

426
00:42:54,789 --> 00:42:56,095
just to vote?

427
00:42:56,225 --> 00:42:58,445
You see, this is a fine
example of how the media

428
00:42:58,576 --> 00:43:01,927
likes to deflect the
real issues with fake news.

429
00:43:02,057 --> 00:43:03,711
So you're
standing by your claim?

430
00:43:03,842 --> 00:43:06,061
Yes, and I think it
takes pretty brave folks

431
00:43:06,192 --> 00:43:07,976
to come out here
and speak up to deliver

432
00:43:08,107 --> 00:43:10,805
the chilling message of
truth to the American people.

433
00:43:10,936 --> 00:43:13,025
Yes, if what you
were saying were true,

434
00:43:13,155 --> 00:43:14,809
it would indeed be chilling.

435
00:43:14,940 --> 00:43:16,158
- Thank you.
- Defend the line!

436
00:43:16,289 --> 00:43:18,813
Well, there you have it, Duke.
Back to you.

437
00:43:18,944 --> 00:43:21,120
Defend the line!
Defend the line!

438
00:43:21,250 --> 00:43:22,991
Defend the line!
Defend the line!

439
00:43:29,868 --> 00:43:32,174
That was bullshit, man.

440
00:43:37,745 --> 00:43:40,052
I'm so proud of you, honey.

441
00:44:12,040 --> 00:44:14,782
They have us
surrounded, little one.

442
00:44:14,913 --> 00:44:16,958
If we stick around,
we'll surely get caught.

443
00:44:22,616 --> 00:44:25,663
Way to be
inconspicuous there, Ed.

444
00:44:25,793 --> 00:44:26,793
It's a trap.

445
00:44:27,665 --> 00:44:29,754
He knows that
we've been following him.

446
00:44:32,321 --> 00:44:33,321
Bullshit.

447
00:44:34,280 --> 00:44:36,151
You think he's
the only one that can track?

448
00:44:38,850 --> 00:44:40,939
We've been running parallel
against the wind all day

449
00:44:41,069 --> 00:44:42,723
and keeping a good distance.

450
00:44:44,943 --> 00:44:45,987
He's a Shadow Wolf.

451
00:44:46,945 --> 00:44:48,816
Shadow Wolf, my ass.

452
00:44:50,383 --> 00:44:52,211
I grew up with
all those res kids

453
00:44:53,865 --> 00:44:55,301
and they ain't
any better than us.

454
00:45:03,265 --> 00:45:04,963
And I know that
dirty little Mexican's

455
00:45:05,093 --> 00:45:06,181
up on that hill somewhere.

456
00:45:08,140 --> 00:45:09,987
I say we keep glancing
the area and wait for him

457
00:45:10,011 --> 00:45:11,186
to light something up.

458
00:45:12,448 --> 00:45:13,928
Then go get him.

459
00:45:14,059 --> 00:45:15,669
Bring him back down to Ed?

460
00:45:15,800 --> 00:45:16,800
Yep.

461
00:45:18,106 --> 00:45:19,891
Like we're
being nice and helpful.

462
00:45:22,850 --> 00:45:23,851
Then plug them both.

463
00:45:32,947 --> 00:45:34,862
We're almost to
the Interstate 8,

464
00:45:36,298 --> 00:45:39,737
and from there you can
go deep into this country.

465
00:45:43,871 --> 00:45:44,959
And in this country,

466
00:45:48,136 --> 00:45:50,051
you can be
anything your heart desires.

467
00:45:51,966 --> 00:45:54,012
Maybe even.

468
00:45:54,142 --> 00:45:55,142
Huh?

469
00:46:55,116 --> 00:46:57,118
Travis! Travis!

470
00:46:57,249 --> 00:46:59,773
- What?
- He's on the move.

471
00:46:59,904 --> 00:47:01,079
Let's go! Let's go!

472
00:47:01,209 --> 00:47:02,209
Shit.

473
00:47:35,026 --> 00:47:37,332
Why'd he be burning his shit?

474
00:47:42,207 --> 00:47:44,731
It's a baby's diaper.

475
00:47:44,862 --> 00:47:47,168
What the fuck,
are they running babies now?

476
00:47:49,388 --> 00:47:51,172
Was there a baby at that truck?

477
00:47:52,086 --> 00:47:53,479
I don't know.

478
00:47:53,609 --> 00:47:54,609
Travis!

479
00:47:55,655 --> 00:47:58,440
I don't know, it all
happened too fucking fast!

480
00:48:01,095 --> 00:48:03,184
You were down in that shit.

481
00:48:03,315 --> 00:48:05,056
I could've swore
I heard a baby crying!

482
00:48:05,186 --> 00:48:07,362
Shut your fucking mouth.

483
00:48:07,493 --> 00:48:09,930
Don't you say that,
I don't kill babies.

484
00:48:10,975 --> 00:48:14,848
I am sick and tired of
you telling me what to do and what to say!

485
00:48:14,979 --> 00:48:18,156
It's because of you we
are knee deep in this shit!

486
00:48:18,286 --> 00:48:19,611
Yeah, well
I seem to recall you doing

487
00:48:19,635 --> 00:48:21,507
a whole lot of
shooting too, brother.

488
00:48:44,051 --> 00:48:45,966
This shit isn't gonna work, ese.

489
00:48:47,881 --> 00:48:51,232
- Fuck the <i>mojados.</i>
- Hey, look,.

490
00:48:51,363 --> 00:48:54,932
It's too fucking risky, ese.
Besides, we already crossed over the border

491
00:48:55,062 --> 00:48:58,152
and I don't have time
to argue with bitchy <i>mojados.</i>

492
00:48:58,283 --> 00:49:00,589
Grab the baby
in the back, <i>muchacho.</i>

493
00:49:08,336 --> 00:49:09,336
Sid.

494
00:49:12,645 --> 00:49:15,039
There's been a change of plans.

495
00:49:15,169 --> 00:49:16,910
Listen to me,
you little schmuck.

496
00:49:17,041 --> 00:49:18,607
Sid, just listen to me.

497
00:49:18,738 --> 00:49:20,618
The next time you call me
it better be confirmed

498
00:49:20,696 --> 00:49:23,438
that my package
made it to the Indian.

499
00:49:23,569 --> 00:49:25,527
I got it all under control.

500
00:49:28,313 --> 00:49:31,098
You'll get the
rest of your money then.

501
00:49:35,537 --> 00:49:36,537
Lasaro!

502
00:49:44,198 --> 00:49:45,199
Hey! Hey!

503
00:49:46,722 --> 00:49:50,291
A lot has changed since
you were in <i>la pinta,</i> ese.

504
00:49:52,641 --> 00:49:54,426
Do you hear that?

505
00:49:54,556 --> 00:49:55,644
Yeah.

506
00:50:09,136 --> 00:50:10,181
Let's rock.

507
00:50:16,535 --> 00:50:19,451
Freeze!
Everybody get your hands up!

508
00:50:19,581 --> 00:50:22,889
Get your dirty hands up, amigo!

509
00:50:23,020 --> 00:50:25,326
Oh yeah, you're the ringleader.

510
00:50:30,157 --> 00:50:32,638
No,
you "habla inglés" just fine!

511
00:50:36,729 --> 00:50:38,078
No!

512
00:50:43,562 --> 00:50:44,911
What the fuck is he saying?

513
00:51:05,845 --> 00:51:08,108
I should've frisked them.

514
00:51:18,205 --> 00:51:20,077
We'll find
something soon, princess.

515
00:51:35,179 --> 00:51:38,617
Never catch me.
Hold on, princess! Hold on!

516
00:52:54,475 --> 00:52:56,260
Give me the pack!

517
00:52:57,783 --> 00:53:00,264
I don't see it
in your fucking eyes. Later.

518
00:53:00,394 --> 00:53:03,049
Give me your hand!

519
00:54:49,416 --> 00:54:50,678
Looks like they disappeared.

520
00:54:50,809 --> 00:54:52,506
I know they came in here.

521
00:54:54,943 --> 00:54:58,251
Maybe they doubled back
or the coyote did.

522
00:54:59,252 --> 00:55:01,863
Or else he got in the river
and headed downstream.

523
00:55:03,082 --> 00:55:04,642
You think the
coyote jumped in the river

524
00:55:04,736 --> 00:55:06,346
and Ed's chasing beside him?

525
00:55:08,392 --> 00:55:09,392
Or better yet,

526
00:55:10,829 --> 00:55:13,397
Ed's a mile down at the bend,
cutting him off at that pass.

527
00:55:17,096 --> 00:55:18,402
This isn't good, man.

528
00:55:20,534 --> 00:55:22,493
Yeah, it's gonna
start to get messy.

529
00:55:24,886 --> 00:55:28,542
Well, let's get through the bend. We
don't even have time to think.

530
00:55:56,744 --> 00:55:59,573
Come on!
We're not gonna catch up, man.

531
00:55:59,704 --> 00:56:00,748
The current's too fast.

532
00:56:00,879 --> 00:56:02,446
They're probably miles up.

533
00:56:03,969 --> 00:56:05,231
Bullshit!

534
00:56:05,927 --> 00:56:07,799
You ain't quitting now, man!

535
00:56:07,929 --> 00:56:09,757
Don't question my heart, okay?

536
00:56:09,888 --> 00:56:13,544
Get out of my face!

537
00:56:19,637 --> 00:56:21,247
You don't want
a piece of this, Travis.

538
00:56:21,378 --> 00:56:23,336
I'm all you got, man!

539
00:56:23,467 --> 00:56:24,163
We're all we got.

540
00:56:24,293 --> 00:56:25,817
Bullshit!

541
00:56:25,947 --> 00:56:27,819
Once Lily finds out
what we did...

542
00:56:38,960 --> 00:56:41,746
Fuck! End of the war, huh?

543
00:56:41,876 --> 00:56:43,704
You just give up
and go to prison?

544
00:56:45,880 --> 00:56:47,621
I'd rather be dead
than locked up.

545
00:56:47,752 --> 00:56:49,275
Then why are we fighting?

546
00:56:49,406 --> 00:56:52,670
Because you're a
self-absorbed asshole, man!

547
00:56:52,800 --> 00:56:55,412
Stop referring to
all this shit as war!

548
00:56:55,542 --> 00:56:56,717
This ain't war!

549
00:56:59,851 --> 00:57:02,636
Hey, look, don't think
you're better than me

550
00:57:02,767 --> 00:57:05,204
just because you
served and I didn't.

551
00:57:05,334 --> 00:57:07,336
I've never held
that against you, man.

552
00:57:08,555 --> 00:57:11,558
But you gotta stop with
all this gung-ho bullshit!

553
00:57:13,604 --> 00:57:17,564
Yeah. I guess I get a little
carried away at times.

554
00:57:22,569 --> 00:57:23,744
You love your country.

555
00:57:25,398 --> 00:57:26,660
I love my country too.

556
00:57:35,626 --> 00:57:37,584
I know a place right here,

557
00:57:37,715 --> 00:57:39,760
you can get all the food
and milk you want.

558
00:57:42,720 --> 00:57:45,026
Yeah, right there.

559
00:57:45,157 --> 00:57:46,157
Right there.

560
00:57:51,555 --> 00:57:54,471
Where were you
in the winter of 1998?

561
00:57:54,601 --> 00:57:56,385
That was almost 20 years ago.

562
00:57:57,691 --> 00:58:01,695
Oh, come on, Ed. You remember
that place like it was yesterday.

563
00:58:01,826 --> 00:58:03,480
How could you forget that?

564
00:58:03,610 --> 00:58:06,091
The guy that was stabbed
in the neck right next to you

565
00:58:06,221 --> 00:58:08,615
while you were on
the phone with your wife?

566
00:58:09,616 --> 00:58:10,965
That was a lifetime ago.

567
00:58:12,576 --> 00:58:13,707
I'm a different person.

568
00:58:15,143 --> 00:58:16,143
Maybe.

569
00:58:17,929 --> 00:58:20,061
I know that face can
scare a person straight.

570
00:58:21,062 --> 00:58:22,062
It would me.

571
00:58:24,675 --> 00:58:26,503
You're a convicted felon, Ed.

572
00:58:28,156 --> 00:58:29,854
That was expunged.

573
00:58:29,984 --> 00:58:31,986
My rights have been restored.

574
00:58:33,074 --> 00:58:34,074
I can vote,

575
00:58:35,076 --> 00:58:36,076
have a gun.

576
00:58:37,775 --> 00:58:38,950
Is this why I'm here?

577
00:58:44,825 --> 00:58:46,610
This can go two ways, Ed.

578
00:58:47,741 --> 00:58:49,526
I can get up
and walk out of here,

579
00:58:49,656 --> 00:58:50,701
go back to Washington

580
00:58:50,831 --> 00:58:52,485
and you and I have never met.

581
00:58:53,399 --> 00:58:57,925
Or I can press record
and erase your ass.

582
00:59:05,803 --> 00:59:09,154
What do I have to do
for you to go back?

583
00:59:14,899 --> 00:59:16,988
There's a package coming in.

584
00:59:17,118 --> 00:59:18,467
On the border?

585
00:59:18,598 --> 00:59:19,860
Yep.

586
00:59:19,991 --> 00:59:21,166
Through your corridor.

587
00:59:22,080 --> 00:59:25,083
On a moving truck
in the desert in two days.

588
00:59:29,740 --> 00:59:32,656
And all you have to do
is make an unofficial bust.

589
01:01:23,810 --> 01:01:25,072
Hey, princess.

590
01:01:37,998 --> 01:01:39,783
Hey!

591
01:01:39,913 --> 01:01:41,001
Motherfucker!

592
01:01:42,176 --> 01:01:43,176
Stop!

593
01:01:44,788 --> 01:01:47,181
I'm tired of you people
messing with my house.

594
01:01:51,490 --> 01:01:52,839
Stay away from that bag.

595
01:01:52,970 --> 01:01:54,188
I said stop.

596
01:01:59,454 --> 01:02:00,454
Yeah, man.

597
01:02:02,501 --> 01:02:03,937
I was thirsty.

598
01:02:04,068 --> 01:02:06,026
This is America, right?

599
01:02:06,157 --> 01:02:07,767
Don't play stupid with me.

600
01:02:07,898 --> 01:02:09,595
You know
exactly where you're at.

601
01:02:09,726 --> 01:02:11,989
You didn't even try
the faucet's out back, why?

602
01:02:13,251 --> 01:02:15,949
- Well, I was...
- Why, because you knew they were off.

603
01:02:16,080 --> 01:02:18,800
- You knew because you've been here before!
- No, no, please, please.

604
01:02:20,388 --> 01:02:21,388
Alright?

605
01:02:22,434 --> 01:02:24,218
What the hell are
you doing with that baby?

606
01:02:26,830 --> 01:02:31,182
If I told you, man,
you'd never believe me.

607
01:02:35,839 --> 01:02:37,014
Just try me.

608
01:03:20,797 --> 01:03:21,928
Here you go, man.

609
01:03:22,929 --> 01:03:24,061
She's all cleaned up.

610
01:03:27,586 --> 01:03:29,109
There she is.

611
01:03:38,292 --> 01:03:40,077
Why you helping me, man?

612
01:03:42,906 --> 01:03:43,950
My wife.

613
01:03:46,083 --> 01:03:47,258
She was a kind soul.

614
01:03:49,390 --> 01:03:52,263
No matter what kind of people
came through here,

615
01:03:52,393 --> 01:03:55,005
she'd accept them,
she'd help them.

616
01:03:58,008 --> 01:03:59,444
A lot more tolerant than I was.

617
01:04:01,272 --> 01:04:03,056
So, I'm doing it for her

618
01:04:04,188 --> 01:04:06,364
and I'm doing it for
the future of that child.

619
01:04:09,280 --> 01:04:10,324
Why are you doing it?

620
01:04:12,370 --> 01:04:17,070
I mean, a guy like you, you could've left
that kid out there to die easily.

621
01:04:22,336 --> 01:04:23,336
My mother.

622
01:04:25,165 --> 01:04:26,340
She always used to say,

623
01:04:27,733 --> 01:04:30,475
"You either create or take."

624
01:04:32,738 --> 01:04:34,261
And all my life I've taken.

625
01:04:36,002 --> 01:04:38,352
The only thing I ever created
was pain for others.

626
01:04:39,876 --> 01:04:41,965
A baby changes all that?

627
01:04:45,490 --> 01:04:46,490
Si, man.

628
01:04:50,234 --> 01:04:51,888
Thanks for your help, man.

629
01:04:52,018 --> 01:04:53,019
I appreciate it.

630
01:04:54,412 --> 01:04:55,500
Yeah, well,

631
01:04:55,630 --> 01:04:56,762
don't thank me yet.

632
01:04:57,676 --> 01:04:59,460
We haven't made it
to the interstate.

633
01:05:00,374 --> 01:05:02,507
First we gotta get
through the corridor.

634
01:05:02,637 --> 01:05:03,637
Let me show you.

635
01:05:04,596 --> 01:05:05,596
I got a map.

636
01:05:09,644 --> 01:05:12,778
As I'm sure you're aware of
this patch right here.

637
01:05:12,909 --> 01:05:14,911
It's got lookouts on both sides.

638
01:05:17,739 --> 01:05:21,961
Exactly. Everything
funnels in through there.

639
01:05:23,745 --> 01:05:27,488
What if I was able to make my way up over
one of the hills through the Falcon?

640
01:05:30,013 --> 01:05:31,405
Right through?

641
01:05:31,536 --> 01:05:33,166
That would give you
the element of surprise.

642
01:05:33,190 --> 01:05:34,234
Mm-hmm.

643
01:05:36,236 --> 01:05:38,586
Best thing I can do for you is

644
01:05:38,717 --> 01:05:40,347
tie up that border agent
that's tracking you,

645
01:05:40,371 --> 01:05:41,938
give you a head start.

646
01:05:43,548 --> 01:05:45,115
Where's he at?

647
01:05:45,245 --> 01:05:48,031
In the bushes right over there.

648
01:05:57,083 --> 01:05:58,911
We can elude him, man.

649
01:05:59,042 --> 01:06:01,000
It's not a problem.

650
01:06:02,480 --> 01:06:03,480
Yeah.

651
01:06:26,504 --> 01:06:28,375
<i>Have I gone too far?</i>

652
01:06:29,507 --> 01:06:31,335
<i>Stalking him like some animal</i>

653
01:06:32,640 --> 01:06:34,381
<i>and to deal with the Devil.</i>

654
01:08:09,520 --> 01:08:11,478
Hey, I'm ready, man.

655
01:08:11,609 --> 01:08:12,609
Alright.

656
01:08:22,750 --> 01:08:24,100
<i>For all that has been done</i>

657
01:08:24,230 --> 01:08:25,318
<i>to him out here,</i>

658
01:08:26,014 --> 01:08:27,581
<i>he still chooses to be kind.</i>

659
01:08:30,236 --> 01:08:31,236
<i>Bless his heart.</i>

660
01:08:35,850 --> 01:08:37,243
We're clear.

661
01:09:17,457 --> 01:09:20,982
- Who the fuck is this guy?
- I don't know, but whoever it is, he's coming in hot.

662
01:09:22,201 --> 01:09:23,637
Hold on!

663
01:09:58,716 --> 01:09:59,716
Travis!

664
01:10:07,290 --> 01:10:09,770
It's gonna be all right.

665
01:10:09,901 --> 01:10:11,337
Ed!

666
01:10:12,208 --> 01:10:14,384
Wherever the fuck you are,

667
01:10:15,472 --> 01:10:16,821
Travis is dying, man!

668
01:10:31,488 --> 01:10:33,316
Sleep well, soldier.

669
01:13:30,884 --> 01:13:32,712
The great Shadow Wolf.

670
01:13:51,122 --> 01:13:52,428
Coyote!

671
01:14:44,218 --> 01:14:45,524
This is it.

672
01:14:47,787 --> 01:14:49,572
When you get famous

673
01:14:50,442 --> 01:14:53,663
don't forget Lasaro
Antonio Laveras Gutierrez.

674
01:16:04,081 --> 01:16:05,909
<i>You have
no choice but the corridor,</i>

675
01:16:06,039 --> 01:16:07,039
<i>Coyote.</i>

676
01:18:11,034 --> 01:18:12,862
I'm gonna go take
care of these fools.

677
01:19:16,403 --> 01:19:17,709
Fuck!

678
01:20:04,364 --> 01:20:05,931
I've failed you.

679
01:21:20,571 --> 01:21:23,008
You can't outrun a bullet, ese?

680
01:21:23,139 --> 01:21:24,183
Don't worry.

681
01:21:24,314 --> 01:21:25,489
I'll kill you both.

682
01:21:43,202 --> 01:21:45,161
You're home now, princess.

683
01:22:16,148 --> 01:22:18,368
- What happened to you?
- Work.

684
01:22:20,500 --> 01:22:22,415
What're you
gonna do about the baby?

685
01:22:24,374 --> 01:22:25,418
I'm gonna raise it.

686
01:22:26,680 --> 01:22:27,680
Move on.

687
01:22:29,205 --> 01:22:30,380
Can't have kids.

688
01:22:30,510 --> 01:22:32,121
Sorry to hear that, agent.

689
01:22:36,081 --> 01:22:37,430
Diane.

690
01:22:37,561 --> 01:22:39,128
Diane.

691
01:22:43,132 --> 01:22:47,005
I have this friend and he
set it up as far as the border.

692
01:22:48,093 --> 01:22:49,965
And that's when I came in.

693
01:22:50,095 --> 01:22:53,533
Well, if I could
dig up your past,

694
01:22:53,664 --> 01:22:54,664
anybody could.

695
01:22:56,101 --> 01:22:57,276
Why don't you go retire?

696
01:23:00,279 --> 01:23:01,585
Go get that fat pension.

697
01:23:05,502 --> 01:23:08,244
Thank you, Ed,
for giving me a family.

698
01:23:08,374 --> 01:23:09,985
Don't thank me.

699
01:23:10,115 --> 01:23:11,247
Thank the coyote.

700
01:23:49,154 --> 01:23:51,461
We're going home, princess.
