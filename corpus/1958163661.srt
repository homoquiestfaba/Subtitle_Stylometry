00:00:07,359 --> 00:00:12,061
I figured it must be at
least 300 feet across

3
00:00:12,085 --> 00:00:15,000
Are you kidding me with this stuff?

4
00:00:15,039 --> 00:00:18,439
What? No, just look at it,

5
00:00:19,839 --> 00:00:22,000
Sanford, it is clearly a farmer who put

6
00:00:22,079 --> 00:00:23,899
a kid up in a tree before have cabins

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,518
and fishing line and
try to make a quick fight

8
00:00:27,839 --> 00:00:28,839
No.

9
00:00:28,879 --> 00:00:30,535
No, yeah, I know what kind of show we have

10
00:00:30,559 --> 00:00:33,216
but I think we can have a little bit

11
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:34,719
more respect for the audience.

12
00:00:34,799 --> 00:00:36,878
Look, I don't need to watch it again.

13
00:00:36,971 --> 00:00:38,887
I'm watching it now.
It's a hubcap, Sanford,

14
00:00:38,911 --> 00:00:41,919
It's totally at wood

15
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,415
As we see the number of discrete

16
00:00:43,439 --> 00:00:45,878
languages decrease in an increasing rate.

17
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:48,775
Does that sound right actually?
If I didn't... yes.

18
00:00:48,799 --> 00:00:52,799
We can expect ♪♪♪ your car keys

19
00:00:56,840 --> 00:01:00,359
Yeah, no, no, no, no, it's not the same

20
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:03,335
as the bigfoot story no because that person

21
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:05,439
actually looked like bigfoot.

22
00:01:05,599 --> 00:01:07,414
Oh, that was your uncle.

23
00:01:07,438 --> 00:01:09,319
0h well you know you didn't tell me that.

24
00:01:09,519 --> 00:01:12,079
Oh I have class, gotta go.

25
00:01:12,319 --> 00:01:14,039
Honey have you seen my car keys?

26
00:01:14,079 --> 00:01:15,519
Let me use the extra set, all right.

27
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:19,016
Yeah a hole. Okay, wait.
Hey come here, yep.

28
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:21,118
What does that look like to you?

29
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:23,052
Flying saucer.

30
00:01:23,118 --> 00:01:25,159
- where are they?
- Montana.
- The keys!

31
00:01:25,519 --> 00:01:28,408
Try the bedroom. Gotta go.
It's a hubcap.

32
00:01:28,459 --> 00:01:29,816
If that's the way you see it, sweetie.

33
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:32,056
No, there's absolutely
no other way to see it.

34
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:34,879
No, yeah, I'm here.

35
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:38,960
Yeah. Sanford, I know it's your show but
I'm telling you can clearly read Mazda

36
00:01:39,921 --> 00:01:42,600
on this flying saucer.

37
00:01:42,639 --> 00:01:43,478
Okay, I'm on my way.

38
00:01:43,599 --> 00:01:46,478
Yeah, I'll see in a minute.

39
00:01:46,959 --> 00:01:51,478
I'm trying to find anything in this house

40
00:01:58,879 --> 00:02:06,879
So...

41
00:02:12,479 --> 00:02:15,520
Oh, no.

42
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,140
I want to ask you something

43
00:02:21,199 --> 00:02:23,839
What?

44
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,318
What if I kiss you again?

45
00:02:36,318 --> 00:02:38,188
Okay

46
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:56,239
What do these mysterious rings mean?

47
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:58,456
Are they used to convey a message?

48
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:00,120
Crop rings: fact or fantasy?

49
00:03:00,719 --> 00:03:04,376
On the next installment
of "stranger than fiction"

50
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,977
Time to make up your mind.

51
00:03:06,001 --> 00:03:06,400
What?

52
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,460
Which take should I run?

53
00:03:10,479 --> 00:03:12,539
- Eight sounded Okay.
- Hey, I took a look

54
00:03:12,639 --> 00:03:15,015
at that flying saucer cassette.

55
00:03:15,039 --> 00:03:16,455
Not that bad.

56
00:03:16,479 --> 00:03:18,399
Sanford, how can you say that?

57
00:03:18,479 --> 00:03:19,479
There are several shots

58
00:03:19,959 --> 00:03:22,879
where you don't even see "Mazda"

59
00:03:36,878 --> 00:03:38,696
Two ♪♪♪ears♪♪♪ for one.

60
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,695
That's one for free.

61
00:03:40,719 --> 00:03:42,519
It's not even the right season for corn.

62
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:45,657
It's a new hybrid. Hey, maybe you could do

63
00:03:45,681 --> 00:03:47,160
one of your shows on it.

64
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:51,539
Genetically altered corn.
Stranger than fiction.

65
00:03:51,563 --> 00:03:52,239
Maggie, I need to talk to you about

66
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,479
something, but I can see you're busy, so

67
00:03:54,539 --> 00:03:56,555
I'll just come back later, Okay?

68
00:03:56,579 --> 00:03:58,536
Hey, are you embarrassed to be seen

69
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,800
with your best friend?
- No

70
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:02,376
In fact I'd like one of those outfits

71
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,480
but with more of a plunging husk line.

72
00:04:04,639 --> 00:04:06,199
It's a lot better than standing behind

73
00:04:06,279 --> 00:04:09,119
a register all day.
- If you say so.

74
00:04:09,199 --> 00:04:10,560
Oh

75
00:04:10,719 --> 00:04:12,626
Buy some corn, get
me in solid with the boss.

76
00:04:12,650 --> 00:04:14,399
I don't need any corn.

77
00:04:14,639 --> 00:04:18,375
I'm fresh off the farm

78
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:21,576
and I'm on here.

79
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,919
All right.

80
00:04:25,439 --> 00:04:27,415
You can steam, you can boil, you can throw

81
00:04:27,439 --> 00:04:29,478
me on the grill, I won't add weight

82
00:04:29,918 --> 00:04:32,198
to your hips or grocery bills, Okay?

83
00:04:32,478 --> 00:04:35,118
You win, yeah, boy, cool.
Maggie you can

84
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:37,495
stop talking now.

85
00:04:37,519 --> 00:04:39,016
Okay.

86
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:41,096
Okay, come on.

87
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:43,976
Corn, lots of corn!

88
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,336
Thank you.

89
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:47,800
Oh what'd you want to talk to me about?

90
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:57,495
- So you saw this ring.
- Yes, I saw the ring.

91
00:04:57,519 --> 00:04:59,576
It's great.

92
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:02,440
- What's the problem?
- Well there's no problem.

93
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:04,207
I mean, maybe I'm the problem.

94
00:05:04,231 --> 00:05:06,316
Joe's terrific, he's just...

95
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:08,240
been a perpetual student for six years

96
00:05:08,319 --> 00:05:10,216
and shows no interest in anything

97
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:12,160
other than crossword puzzles?

98
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:13,960
Just to guess.

99
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:17,255
He's always majoring in folklore.

100
00:05:17,279 --> 00:05:19,377
Look, some people take a lot longer

101
00:05:19,401 --> 00:05:21,599
to find themselves that's all. Look at me.

102
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:25,250
We change the subject.

103
00:05:25,279 --> 00:05:27,599
Okay.

104
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,735
Hey, somebody's got a birthday coming up.

105
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:33,319
Different subject.

106
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:38,689
I know I can't believe
we're all turning 30.

107
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:45,520
My brother's in town.

108
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,519
You know, Nick still talks about you.

109
00:05:50,530 --> 00:05:52,951
The road not taken...

110
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:55,398
Are the rumors true, Nick?

111
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,160
Yeah, Ted, I have to admit the rumors

112
00:05:57,199 --> 00:05:58,900
are true. You know I... uh

113
00:05:58,959 --> 00:06:00,475
dated a lot of wonderful women in my

114
00:06:00,499 --> 00:06:02,390
life but I honestly feel that when you

115
00:06:02,478 --> 00:06:04,377
find the right one, you've just got to

116
00:06:04,401 --> 00:06:06,325
step up to the play, you know, yeah

117
00:06:06,349 --> 00:06:08,216
so I know I must have
dumped him for a reason

118
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:10,780
but now; for the life of
me, I can't remember why

119
00:06:10,918 --> 00:06:14,216
Steph, I love you, be home soon.

120
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:16,297
That's right Cy, our young
award winner Nick Fowler

121
00:06:16,321 --> 00:06:21,319
got engaged last night in Las Vegas.

122
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:26,038
Here, take some of that.

123
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:39,038
- You're home?
- In the kitchen

124
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:43,816
What's a nine letter word for...

125
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:47,478
circumciser craft.
- Guess what I saw today

126
00:06:47,839 --> 00:06:50,038
Maggie, guess what she was

127
00:06:50,478 --> 00:06:53,159
- why would I see a urologist
- Pocahontas's

128
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:54,180
- preferred produce
- a giant ear of corn

129
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:55,999
Close!

130
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:04,175
- Maze and how was Maggie?
- You tell me

131
00:07:04,199 --> 00:07:05,199
she was an ear of corn

132
00:07:05,279 --> 00:07:06,696
well maybe that's what she's supposed to
be in this life

133
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:09,810
Oh that's a depressing thought

134
00:07:09,839 --> 00:07:11,239
Mail's on the counter.

135
00:07:11,439 --> 00:07:15,319
I think somebody came for you.

136
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:27,230
- Anything else?
- No

137
00:07:27,279 --> 00:07:31,638
- Are you expecting something?
- No

138
00:07:31,679 --> 00:07:32,679
Maybe

139
00:07:43,598 --> 00:07:48,598
don't get up, I know you've had
a hard day Jefferson

140
00:07:59,598 --> 00:08:01,620
You know what we ought to do?

141
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:03,096
We ought to go to that Bed and Breakfast

142
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,295
for Thanksgiving you know the one

143
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:05,860
you like, the French place.

144
00:08:05,889 --> 00:08:06,935
L'Auberge du moulin?

145
00:08:06,959 --> 00:08:08,038
Yeah, that one.

146
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,014
Why?

147
00:08:09,038 --> 00:08:11,403
Come on, it'll be romantic;
you can speak French,

148
00:08:11,427 --> 00:08:12,719
We'll have fun.

149
00:08:13,140 --> 00:08:15,336
I don't know.

150
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:17,312
- What about Jefferson?
- Maggie can take

151
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:19,096
care of Jefferson.

152
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:21,735
You want to spend turkey day with Maggie?

153
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:23,977
She'll go to the store and give you treats.

154
00:08:24,001 --> 00:08:27,839
Even better, she won't
spray you with perfume.

155
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,367
There you go, that was a Yes.

156
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:33,655
No, you didn't hear
the diphthong at the end

157
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:35,416
of the bark. That was a maybe.

158
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:37,559
Besides, Jefferson likes my perfume

159
00:08:37,759 --> 00:08:39,416
So do I.

160
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:41,176
Come on, my parents aren't gonna be here

161
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:44,200
for Thanksgiving. We'll be alone

162
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:45,576
Joe, you have parents
and siblings and really

163
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,227
happy thanksgiving memories

164
00:08:47,251 --> 00:08:50,376
I have no parents no siblings
and rather mediocre

165
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:52,280
thanksgiving memories.
- Great, we'll change it.

166
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:55,559
Okay Okay

167
00:08:55,759 --> 00:08:57,254
It'll be romantic.

168
00:08:57,278 --> 00:08:58,855
Wait, that's the second time
you use that word.

169
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:04,778
You don't like romance.

170
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,390
Just a little.

171
00:09:09,919 --> 00:09:11,895
Come on, you won't regret this

172
00:09:11,919 --> 00:09:14,120
Turkey dinner, no cleanup.

173
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,920
Okay

174
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:25,039
There you go, I'll make the reservations.

175
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:30,159
I just haven't had their phone number on me

176
00:09:32,958 --> 00:09:34,359
Oh, what was I supposed to do?

177
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:39,015
Join us tomorrow for a look
at NASA's latest Mars probe.

178
00:09:39,039 --> 00:09:41,399
What they don't want you to know

179
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:44,400
Plus astrologer to the stars!

180
00:09:44,450 --> 00:09:47,976
That's tomorrow on "stranger than fiction"

Beth, I got to talk to you.

Oh, if it's about the nun
who has the cat who stick

186
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,959
modest, she won't appear
on camera with the cat

187
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:09,240
but she will let the cat appear alone.

188

No, it's about the opening for

I just got promoted to on-air producer.

194

Now I know you've got a lot of great ideas

196
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:31,100
so we need to get together and talk as
soon as possible. Okay?

197
00:10:46,958 --> 00:10:49,176
Could it be true?

198
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:51,576
Are there other worlds parallel

That's what some

- Très très charmant.

00:18:09,759 --> 00:18:11,479
Oh no I just told him that sometimes you

You know, you finish the dinner

342

and you pull a wishbone.

343
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:19,295
Well, I don't know.
The only thanksgivings

344
00:18:19,319 --> 00:18:21,240
I remember were after my mom died.

345
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:22,826
I lived with my aunt Charlotte
and she didn't like turkey.

346
00:18:22,850 --> 00:18:24,976

it was pretty good

350
00:18:31,038 --> 00:18:33,119
but I don't remember any wishbones.

351
00:18:34,319 --> 00:18:35,399
Oh, man.

352
00:18:35,599 --> 00:18:37,319

00:18:42,079 --> 00:18:43,255

00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:49,240
things.

00:18:49,359 --> 00:18:50,598
Things?

360
00:18:50,798 --> 00:18:53,159
What kind of things?

361
00:18:53,359 --> 00:18:55,759
Marriage things.

362
00:19:01,839 --> 00:19:02,839
Honey,

363
00:19:03,038 --> 00:19:05,200
I'm very happy with the way things are.

364
00:19:07,839 --> 00:19:10,200
You're bored with the way things are.

365
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:12,940
What, us getting married
is gonna change all that?

366
00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:19,879
I'm sorry.

367
00:19:20,079 --> 00:19:21,479
That came out seriously wrong.

368
00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:23,838
I didn't mean it that way.

369
00:19:25,038 --> 00:19:27,079
For a second, I was worried.

370
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:38,838
Who is it?

371
00:19:39,038 --> 00:19:43,759
Excuse me but the chef
has found your wishbone.

372
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:46,358
Oh...

373
00:19:46,558 --> 00:19:48,534
- Merci beaucoup.
- Voilà.

374
00:19:48,558 --> 00:19:50,600
- Bonne chance.
- Bonne nuit.

375
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:58,240
They found your wishbone.

376
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:00,760
So what do you think?

377
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:02,080
He went to a lot of trouble.

378
00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:05,320
All right.

379
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,500
- You ready?
- Yeah.

380
00:20:18,079 --> 00:20:26,079
You won.

381
00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:42,120
- Good night.
- Good night.

382
00:21:10,079 --> 00:21:15,319
Be careful what you wish for.

383
00:21:54,839 --> 00:21:56,598
Bonjour Monsieur.

384
00:21:58,798 --> 00:22:00,040
Good morning.

385
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:03,919
Oh yeah, good morning.

386
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:08,838
I was just wondering. Is there any
coffee down here?

387
00:22:09,038 --> 00:22:10,838
Because I couldn't find any in the room.

388
00:22:11,038 --> 00:22:12,456
Normally we don't carry that kind of thing.

389
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:13,959
It's just not much of a call for it.

390
00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:16,119
Not many people like to taste

391
00:22:16,319 --> 00:22:18,119
and it stains the teeth.

392
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:25,240
What?

393
00:22:26,319 --> 00:22:29,558
The car.

394
00:22:50,079 --> 00:22:54,038
Honey, did you move the mustang

395
00:22:54,319 --> 00:22:55,959
It wasn't out in front, did you move it?

396
00:22:58,079 --> 00:23:01,279
Was that a yes or no?

397
00:23:01,599 --> 00:23:03,240
This is great music.

398
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:05,558
Did you put the station on?

399
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:16,919
Sweetheart...

400
00:23:17,119 --> 00:23:19,639
This is kind of embarrassing to ask.

401
00:23:19,839 --> 00:23:21,319
I know we weren't exactly in the mood

402
00:23:21,359 --> 00:23:23,079
last night but I had the oddest feeling

403
00:23:23,279 --> 00:23:25,240
when I woke up this morning.

404
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:27,719
Did we do anything?

405
00:23:27,919 --> 00:23:30,480
It's a lot

406
00:23:30,558 --> 00:23:33,479
We did anything three times!
- Nick!

407
00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:35,880
Where did you come from?
- Shower.

408
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:44,280
You stay away from me. I like this

409
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:46,358
another game. Okay, which one is

410
00:23:46,558 --> 00:23:48,040
this? Maybe... lady in the witness

411
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:51,000
protection program?
Ah, come on, Elizabeth.

412
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:53,719
I'm here I'm naked and I'm begging

413
00:23:53,919 --> 00:23:55,999
nobody can believe Sparky's
gonna have our marriage.

414
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:57,480
Marriage?

415
00:23:57,679 --> 00:24:00,598
Elizabeth...
- Who's Elizabeth?
- What?

416
00:24:00,798 --> 00:24:02,295
Okay, Okay, all right
you wanna play that game.

417
00:24:02,319 --> 00:24:04,358
I wanna board, here we go.

418
00:24:04,558 --> 00:24:05,815
Okay, all right, so this is the part I:

419
00:24:05,839 --> 00:24:07,399
break down the door, great. We'll call

420
00:24:07,599 --> 00:24:09,639
this one uh... rugged environment please

421
00:24:09,839 --> 00:24:11,319
distress damage. Okay, I don't have a

422
00:24:11,359 --> 00:24:13,399
dalmatian but I'm coming in.

423
00:24:13,599 --> 00:24:17,399
I've got the axe, it's just
you and me Elisabeth.

424
00:24:27,679 --> 00:24:30,679
Thanks.

425
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:43,512
- Nick, the wheel!
- What?

426
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:49,120
You would give me a
heart attack... music, Okay?

427
00:24:56,159 --> 00:24:57,879
Where did you get that jacket?

428
00:24:58,079 --> 00:24:59,159
This?

429
00:24:59,359 --> 00:25:01,400
Well, I've had it for years why?

430
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:02,520
No.

431
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:04,760
That I would remember.

432
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:06,520
What is that color?

433
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:09,038
Brown.

434
00:25:11,759 --> 00:25:13,479
Okay Nick, you take me to the studio Okay?

435
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:15,880
I need to check on a few things.

436
00:25:17,599 --> 00:25:20,719
The studio, right?

437
00:25:21,038 --> 00:25:22,919
You have been acting weird all morning.

438
00:25:23,119 --> 00:25:25,520
The studio where you work, yes.

439
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:28,839
It's ready

440
00:25:31,599 --> 00:25:32,599
Enjoy.

441
00:25:32,798 --> 00:25:35,200
Thank you.

442
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:37,480
Okay, Nick.

443
00:25:37,599 --> 00:25:38,760
I have to know.

444
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:40,520
Why were you at...

445
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:44,159
Why were you and I at
the bed and breakfast?

446
00:25:45,839 --> 00:25:48,639
Why did we fly to
vegas that time for lunch?

447
00:25:48,798 --> 00:25:50,216
Why did we spend last tuesday night in

448
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:52,598
the catamaran? Why do we do any of it?

449
00:25:52,798 --> 00:25:54,760
Because we can.

450
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:56,358
Catamaran?

451
00:25:56,558 --> 00:26:01,078
Yeah, and let me tell you you look
great in that thong.

452
00:26:10,159 --> 00:26:13,640
To get off the lots.

453
00:26:28,159 --> 00:26:29,159
Come here, babe.

454
00:26:31,679 --> 00:26:32,358
Nick!

455
00:26:32,558 --> 00:26:34,158
What? suddenly youl get shy in front of

456
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:36,640
the security guard?
It's Okay buddy, we're married.

457
00:26:45,278 --> 00:26:47,319
Thank you professor for joining us today.

458
00:26:47,519 --> 00:26:49,319
Let's begin with a discussion on early

459
00:26:49,519 --> 00:26:52,358
parallel universe theory. Did it all stem

460
00:26:52,558 --> 00:26:55,295
from Einstein and his theory of relativity?

461
00:26:55,599 --> 00:26:57,176
Unlikely as that may seem, yes, because it

462
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:59,479
was in fact the Einstein-Rosen bridge

463
00:26:59,679 --> 00:27:01,199
which pinpointed that juncture between

464
00:27:01,359 --> 00:27:03,319
alternate universes though some say

465
00:27:03,519 --> 00:27:07,495
einstein gets too much credit

466
00:27:07,519 --> 00:27:08,559
Brett? Why are you here?

467
00:27:09,519 --> 00:27:10,995
I just brought something to your office.

468
00:27:11,019 --> 00:27:13,558
I have an office?

469
00:27:13,839 --> 00:27:15,439
On the quantum theory of gravity proving

470
00:27:15,599 --> 00:27:19,079
the multiple states.

471
00:27:20,599 --> 00:27:24,079
By George, I think she's got it!

472
00:27:49,599 --> 00:27:53,079
Morning!

473
00:27:53,278 --> 00:27:54,838
Sanford!
- What?

474
00:27:55,038 --> 00:27:57,000
Oh I'm sorry.

475
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:59,159
This has caffeine we ran out of decaf'

476
00:27:59,359 --> 00:28:00,759
brand but I'll run out and get some

477
00:28:00,798 --> 00:28:02,438
during lunch. Oh and I thought you should

478
00:28:02,558 --> 00:28:04,280
know Peg called twice already today.

479
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:08,119
Something wrong?

480
00:28:08,319 --> 00:28:10,040
Why?
- Because you only call me Sanford

481
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:11,639
when you're angry with me

482
00:28:11,839 --> 00:28:14,750
If something is wrong
you should just say so.

483
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:18,399
Don't make me guess, Elizabeth.

484
00:28:19,679 --> 00:28:21,319
Anyway here are the rest of your

485
00:28:21,519 --> 00:28:23,639
messages there were quite a few of them

486
00:28:23,839 --> 00:28:25,399
everybody loved last night's segment on

487
00:28:25,519 --> 00:28:27,000
alternate universes, said it had your

488
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:30,479
special touch.
- Alternate universes?

489
00:28:33,278 --> 00:28:34,374
You know I'd like to look at all the

490
00:28:34,398 --> 00:28:36,198
research you have on alternate universes.

491
00:28:36,398 --> 00:28:38,598
Everything you have I want to look at.

492
00:28:38,798 --> 00:28:40,040
You're the boss.

493
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:41,800
I'm the boss here?

494
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,760
Yes, here, there, over there too.

495
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:47,000
What's with you?
- I don't know I'm feeling

496
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:50,319
a little bit odd today, Sandy my assistant.

497
00:28:54,558 --> 00:28:57,440
Well, here, Elizabeth,
my immediate supervisor.

498
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:00,800
Suck on this, you look like you need it.

499
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:02,295
No, you know what I think you need a

500
00:29:02,319 --> 00:29:05,359
relaxer pop with value.

501
00:29:05,519 --> 00:29:07,639
They're brand new
- oh yeah I'll buy this

502
00:29:07,839 --> 00:29:09,500
main thing.
Yeah moonshot.

503
00:29:09,700 --> 00:29:11,879
- Oh, what's down?
- What's down?

504
00:29:12,079 --> 00:29:14,198
Not much.

505
00:29:14,398 --> 00:29:15,879
Oh also don't forget I will be out of

506
00:29:16,079 --> 00:29:17,959
the office between three and four or

507
00:29:18,159 --> 00:29:20,598
did I tell you that?
- I don't know, you might have.

508
00:29:20,798 --> 00:29:22,278
Well my brother just found out he had

509
00:29:22,319 --> 00:29:23,495
cancer and have to take him over

510
00:29:23,519 --> 00:29:25,719
to the clinic for the shot
- the shot?

511
00:29:25,919 --> 00:29:27,639
- For cancer.
- For cancer?

512
00:29:27,839 --> 00:29:29,399
Is it me or is somebody in this room

513
00:29:29,599 --> 00:29:31,319
repeating everything I say?

514
00:29:31,519 --> 00:29:32,838
Bella, come on, let's go.

515
00:29:33,038 --> 00:29:36,000
Oh oh oh... and good luck at the TV
Academy ball tonight.

516
00:29:36,079 --> 00:29:38,959
I'm going to the Academy ball?

517
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,000
Yes.

518
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,159
Come on, you called this meeting.

519
00:29:43,359 --> 00:29:46,079
Hold her calls!

520
00:29:47,679 --> 00:29:48,679
So...

521
00:29:48,798 --> 00:29:50,598
Why'd you call us all in?

522
00:29:50,798 --> 00:29:52,798
Me?

523
00:30:34,398 --> 00:30:37,719
Nick, your door! I mean, our door.

524
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:41,440
Okay, well, answer it.

525
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:49,000
Maggie! Hi!

526
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:52,600
- Hi.
- Hey Sis', what's down?

527
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:56,200
I just...

528
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:58,119
stopped by to get your autograph for my

529
00:30:58,319 --> 00:30:59,800
boss's son.

530
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,280
He actually hinted I'd be fired if

531
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:05,520
I didn't get it done by tonight.
Sorry to bug you.

532
00:31:06,159 --> 00:31:08,119
It's Okay. Leave it on the table,

533
00:31:08,319 --> 00:31:09,599
- I'll get to them later.
- Okay.

534
00:31:09,759 --> 00:31:12,838
I'll just come back later and get it.

535
00:31:13,038 --> 00:31:15,159
Sorry to bother you.

536
00:31:15,359 --> 00:31:17,800
You both look fabulous. Wherever you're

537
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:21,359
going, have a great time.

538
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:23,480
Bye-bye.

539
00:31:23,599 --> 00:31:26,639
Okay, bye.

540
00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:29,000
What's with her?

541
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:32,198
- She's a drag well
- Don't say that

542
00:31:32,398 --> 00:31:34,280
- Me? You've called her worse.
- I have?

543
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:35,240
Yeah.

544
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:36,838
Oh.

545
00:31:37,038 --> 00:31:39,479
- Well, why is she like that?
- Yeah, who knows?

546
00:31:39,679 --> 00:31:41,719
Probably the job or something, you know...

547
00:31:41,919 --> 00:31:43,959
Assistant marketing analyst...

548
00:31:44,159 --> 00:31:45,559
I think being miserable is a job

549
00:31:45,759 --> 00:31:47,479
requirement and you know that she fits

550
00:31:47,679 --> 00:31:49,479
the bill: never laughs,

551
00:31:49,679 --> 00:31:52,440
never has any fun.

552
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:54,520
Speaking of fun,

553
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:55,720
I think

554
00:31:55,919 --> 00:31:58,838
that we have a little time

555
00:31:59,038 --> 00:32:00,598
before we have to go.

556
00:32:00,798 --> 00:32:04,405
Nick, we just got dressed and stuff...

557
00:32:04,429 --> 00:32:07,358
Yeah, but since when did that
matter to you?

558
00:32:07,919 --> 00:32:09,639
Go on. You want to fool around? come on.

559
00:32:09,839 --> 00:32:11,959
Stop it, we're gonna be late

560
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:46,359
Look at this place.

561
00:32:50,319 --> 00:32:52,519
- Good luck to you
- Yeah, really great game last night.

562
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:56,576
Hey you're late. I thought
you might not make it

563
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:58,760
Oh, something came up.

564
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:00,960
Down, I mean.

565
00:33:13,278 --> 00:33:16,919
Oh, they certainly are very patriotic in
this world.

566
00:33:17,359 --> 00:33:19,418
Nowadays.

567
00:33:21,839 --> 00:33:24,838
Yeah, well, it's that statehood thing.

568
00:33:25,038 --> 00:33:25,719
I wonder where they're

569
00:33:25,919 --> 00:33:28,399
gonna put the 50th star when they let Cuba.

570
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:32,080
Cuba's gonna be the 50th?

571
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:34,720
Oh, I knew that.

572
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:39,720
Honey.

573
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:42,720
Honey!

574
00:33:49,919 --> 00:33:51,078
So...

575
00:33:51,278 --> 00:33:52,760
How long have you not been married?

576
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:55,519
- A long time.
- How long?

577
00:33:58,558 --> 00:34:00,479
Since high school.

578
00:34:01,679 --> 00:34:04,836
All the most successful couples are made
in high school

579
00:34:04,860 --> 00:34:07,078
Ladies and gentlemen, as you know,

580
00:34:07,278 --> 00:34:09,319
each year, we acknowledge one who has

581
00:34:09,519 --> 00:34:11,581
contributed above and
beyond the call of duty

582
00:34:11,605 --> 00:34:14,320
helping to elevate the electronic medium.

583
00:34:14,420 --> 00:34:16,839
With careful consideration,

584
00:34:17,039 --> 00:34:19,080
the Board of Governors narrowed the field

585
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:21,959
to a group of 20 very talented producers.

586
00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:23,319
And let me tell you,

587
00:34:23,519 --> 00:34:25,959
there's no easy decision. This year we

588
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:28,280
are proud enough to give this special

589
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:31,800
award to a singularly dedicated viewer

590
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,718
- What the hell is that?
- Bloody billy with a raw egg.

591
00:34:35,199 --> 00:34:36,519
A raw egg?

592
00:34:36,719 --> 00:34:38,600
I thought I swallowed my tongue.

593
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:42,120
- You said your usual.
- A cranberry spritzer.

594
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:44,776
Yeah in another life.

595
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:46,519
Elizabeth Sager Fowler.

596
00:35:06,719 --> 00:35:08,519
I don't know she's
been acting weird all day.

597
00:35:11,199 --> 00:35:14,159
Congratulations.

598
00:35:19,519 --> 00:35:22,120
I truly have no idea

599
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:25,240
why I've gotten this acknowledgement.

600
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:29,480
You see, I don't belong here.

601
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:34,359
What's she talking about?
She got an invitation.

602
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:36,615
I mean I say that because there are

603
00:35:36,639 --> 00:35:38,319
obviously so many other deserving people.

604
00:35:47,519 --> 00:35:49,399
But I will say that it's a great honor

605
00:35:49,599 --> 00:35:54,359
to accept this recognition for...

606
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:01,594
journalistic excellence?

607
00:36:19,358 --> 00:36:21,399
Thank you.

608
00:36:21,599 --> 00:36:23,560
Thank you.

609
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:26,760
- This world is perfect.
- Elizabeth honey

610
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:29,960
- Congratulations.
- Almost perfect.

611
00:36:31,039 --> 00:36:34,039
Look at you! You look almost grown up

612
00:36:34,239 --> 00:36:35,479
and you...

613
00:36:35,679 --> 00:36:38,439
look absolutely dreamy.

614
00:36:38,639 --> 00:36:41,638
My two favorite producers side by side.

615
00:36:41,838 --> 00:36:43,879
Oh, she's a producer?

616
00:36:44,079 --> 00:36:45,959
Cooler with the put downs would you?

617
00:36:46,159 --> 00:36:46,919
Oh,

618
00:36:47,119 --> 00:36:48,719
everyone, you've heard me talk about him

619
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:50,680
for a long time and now I'd like you to

620
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:54,919
meet my one and only. Here he is this is...

621
00:36:55,119 --> 00:36:56,839
- Joey.
- Hi.

622
00:36:57,039 --> 00:36:59,459
Elizabeth, Darby, Nick.

623
00:37:01,679 --> 00:37:03,240
You want to dance, honey?

624
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:06,440
Okay.

625
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:15,499
Would you?

626
00:37:54,079 --> 00:37:55,080
Sandy...

627
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:58,720
Is Alannah in yet?

628
00:37:59,599 --> 00:38:02,160
I'll be in my office.

629
00:38:03,138 --> 00:38:05,758
- That's not your office.
- I knew that.

630
00:38:07,119 --> 00:38:09,480
You got two more calls from Peg.

631
00:38:17,039 --> 00:38:19,838
Company's come.

632
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:23,399
So...

633
00:38:23,599 --> 00:38:25,175
where did you two
lovebirds end up last night?

634
00:38:25,199 --> 00:38:27,080
Well, after the awards show Nick

635
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:29,399
dragged me off to a sports bar. They sure

636
00:38:29,599 --> 00:38:31,638
love him in those places
- It must be fun

637
00:38:31,838 --> 00:38:33,158
to be on the arms of a handsome

638
00:38:33,358 --> 00:38:36,439
celebrity all the time
- yeah.

639
00:38:36,639 --> 00:38:38,760
So you and that guy uh...

640
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:39,960
Joe was it?

641
00:38:40,159 --> 00:38:44,879
So you two were... he's your...

642
00:38:46,719 --> 00:38:48,720
Are you free for lunch today?
- Sure.

643
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:51,919
It's monday isn't it?
- Yeah.

644
00:38:54,119 --> 00:38:56,359
Every silver lining has a cloud

645
00:38:57,838 --> 00:39:00,439
We get to do this every monday?

646
00:39:00,639 --> 00:39:02,359
You, me and every working woman in America.

647
00:39:11,039 --> 00:39:12,999
Gosh, when I see a blimp I want to go to

648
00:39:13,199 --> 00:39:15,800
Hawaii or someplace, don't you?

649
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,000
Oh yeah.

650
00:39:18,239 --> 00:39:20,039
Remember when we used to play fours

651
00:39:20,239 --> 00:39:22,919
on this wicket?

652
00:39:23,119 --> 00:39:26,000
These good old four days...

653
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:29,959
Your friend Joe seems really nice.

654
00:39:30,159 --> 00:39:31,139
Yeah.

655
00:39:31,039 --> 00:39:34,039
He must have thought I was crazy.

656
00:39:35,119 --> 00:39:37,200
Did he say anything about me?

657
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:39,720
Oh he's such a doll.

658
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:41,600
He didn't give you a second thought.

659
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:44,800
Oh good.

660
00:40:16,079 --> 00:40:19,519
You have to cock it

661
00:40:21,119 --> 00:40:24,920
I always forget that part.

662
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:29,520
I think he might ask me to marry him.

663
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:30,600
Gee...

664
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:33,119
Whiz, you missed the wicket altogether.

665
00:40:36,838 --> 00:40:40,359
Well, looks like I killed you.

666
00:40:40,559 --> 00:40:43,599
Can't win all the time.

667
00:40:45,519 --> 00:40:46,519
Alannah?

668
00:40:46,719 --> 00:40:47,719
Yeah?

669
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:49,958
What makes you think
that he's gonna ask you?

670
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:53,800
Oh, it's just a feeling. Funny thing is

671
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,519
I don't know exactly what I'll say.

672
00:41:04,318 --> 00:41:06,839
- Here we go,
- thank you, I love them and

673
00:41:07,039 --> 00:41:08,456
anything, it's just that I look at what

674
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:10,039
everyone else has in their lives and

675
00:41:10,239 --> 00:41:11,568
I think is that what I really want.

676
00:41:11,592 --> 00:41:14,000
Ever do that?

677
00:41:15,679 --> 00:41:16,999
What?

678
00:41:17,199 --> 00:41:19,158
Awful isn't it? My trainer says I have to

679
00:41:19,358 --> 00:41:21,158
gag three of these down a day. What I

680
00:41:21,358 --> 00:41:23,879
would give for a salad. You are so lucky

681
00:41:24,079 --> 00:41:25,639
you can eat that. Most people would get

682
00:41:25,679 --> 00:41:26,919
really fat.

683
00:41:27,119 --> 00:41:29,240
So then I say to myself, I mean, I know

684
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:31,560
he's no Nick Fowler but then who is?

685
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:33,319
Besides Nick of course.

686
00:41:33,519 --> 00:41:35,800
But there are things about Joe that are

687
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,399
so special, I mean...

688
00:41:37,599 --> 00:41:41,240
he's so smart and he's so romantic.

689
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:42,760
Don't you just love guys that are

690
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:46,359
romantic?
- Can you excuse me for a minute?

691
00:41:46,559 --> 00:41:48,760
I'll be right back.

692
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:51,199
Okay.

693
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:01,270
Okay, I get the point. It's time

694
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:03,959
to wake up now. Okay.

695
00:42:04,159 --> 00:42:05,319
Wake up.

696
00:42:05,519 --> 00:42:06,919
Wake up.

697
00:42:07,119 --> 00:42:08,439
Wake up.

698
00:42:08,639 --> 00:42:10,639
Okay.

699
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:17,560
Speak of the devil, look who showed up.

700
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:19,015
- You remember Elizabeth?
- Yeah, how are you doing?

701
00:42:19,039 --> 00:42:21,000
Hi.

702
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,720
I gotta grab this call; I'll see you later.

703
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:26,680
He just can't stay away from me I guess.

704
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:29,158
- I have some really big news.
- Oh, I thought

705
00:42:29,358 --> 00:42:31,158
I already knew the really big news.

706
00:42:31,358 --> 00:42:34,960
- More! Really big news.
- Oh, boy.

707
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:36,920
All right.

708
00:42:37,119 --> 00:42:38,695
Joe just finished the
piece for the New Yorker

709
00:42:38,719 --> 00:42:40,600
and we are gonna do a segment on it

710
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:41,800
for our show.

711
00:42:42,500 --> 00:42:44,519
Really?

712
00:42:44,719 --> 00:42:46,280
Billy, I'll call you back at five.

713
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:47,720
Well, that's great.

714
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:49,559
What's it about?

715
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:55,158
Inspiration.

716
00:42:55,358 --> 00:42:57,800
Tt's a a right brain phenomena that

717
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,200
everyone experiences but

718
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:01,575
not a lot of people understand it.

719
00:43:01,599 --> 00:43:02,999
You can really talk about it.

720
00:43:03,199 --> 00:43:05,399
He's done all this research and I showed

721
00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:07,319
the article to Darby and he said

722
00:43:07,519 --> 00:43:09,479
that we should do a segment on it.

723
00:43:09,679 --> 00:43:11,479
About what I said before,

724
00:43:11,679 --> 00:43:14,039
it's just between you and me, Okay?
- Okay

725
00:43:14,239 --> 00:43:16,000
Are you guys talking about me?

726
00:43:16,100 --> 00:43:18,439
Oh, just shut up and kiss me.

727
00:43:18,639 --> 00:43:19,986
He loves when I say that.

728
00:43:20,010 --> 00:43:21,638
Green eyed monster.

729
00:43:21,838 --> 00:43:22,839
Me?

730
00:43:23,039 --> 00:43:25,158
Oh no that's mine, she's having the

731
00:43:25,358 --> 00:43:27,959
bloody Billy with the raw egg, right?

732
00:43:28,159 --> 00:43:30,000
Right.

733
00:43:36,590 --> 00:43:38,590
Excuse-me for a second?

734
00:44:20,318 --> 00:44:22,294
- Did you feel that?
- How could I not, what was it?

735
00:44:22,318 --> 00:44:24,039
An earthshift, it must have been

736
00:44:24,239 --> 00:44:26,259
eight or ten degrees.

737
00:44:32,719 --> 00:44:33,986
All right, everybody take it easy.

738
00:44:34,010 --> 00:44:36,760
Keep a warm head.
Alannah get a relaxer out here

739
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:38,535
We're gonna check the building and we're

740
00:44:38,559 --> 00:44:40,760
gonna go back to work.

741
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:42,560
I hate the things, I hate on the fact of

742
00:44:42,639 --> 00:44:44,055
life when you live in california, I guess.

743
00:44:44,079 --> 00:44:45,175
I mean it's not like the ground is

744
00:44:45,199 --> 00:44:46,215
really shaking. It's hard to...

745
00:44:46,239 --> 00:44:48,118
Who's producing Joe's segment, who's gonna

746
00:44:48,318 --> 00:44:51,560
be producing Joe's segment?
- Me, why?

747
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:53,479
Oh, no reason.

748
00:44:53,679 --> 00:44:55,575
- You think it's a bad idea?
- No no it's a great

749
00:44:55,599 --> 00:44:57,080
idea it's just uh...

750
00:44:57,280 --> 00:44:58,720
Well, considering your relationship,

751
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:00,800
people might think it's
nepotism or something

752
00:45:00,831 --> 00:45:02,439
- Why would anyone care?
- Yeah,

753
00:45:02,639 --> 00:45:06,239
you're right. Forget I asked.

754
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:12,680
Elizabeth...

755
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:15,719
Honey, maybe she's
right. It might not be good.

756
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:17,095
I was really looking forward to working

757
00:45:17,119 --> 00:45:18,760
with you Sweetie
- Me too but we have to

758
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:20,776
think about your career.
I mean how would it look

759
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:22,176
if people knew that your girlfriend

760
00:45:22,200 --> 00:45:23,638
got you on the show and gave you

761
00:45:23,838 --> 00:45:25,518
the interview?
Elizabeth would be perfect.

762
00:45:25,790 --> 00:45:28,039
She can take the driest topic

763
00:45:28,239 --> 00:45:30,839
and make it seem interesting.

764
00:45:31,039 --> 00:45:33,720
If... You're sure you
really want to do this?

765
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:35,638
Well, you know I've got a lot of stuff

766
00:45:35,838 --> 00:45:37,959
going on right now. I have those two

767
00:45:38,159 --> 00:45:40,359
pieces on time travel and another one of

768
00:45:40,559 --> 00:45:43,160
fire walking.
- Let me see if Mark Salad is available.

769
00:45:43,260 --> 00:45:47,519
On the other hand, how
can I turn you down...

770
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:49,416
All right, all right, Okay, just another

771
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:51,319
after shift we can expect a few of those.

772
00:45:51,519 --> 00:45:54,910
- Calm down it's Okay
- I guess we can.

773
00:45:59,519 --> 00:46:01,319
Hi, I'm Nick fowler.

774
00:46:01,519 --> 00:46:03,015
You probably know me when I'm pitching

775
00:46:03,039 --> 00:46:04,439
for the Zeppelins but when I'm not

776
00:46:04,639 --> 00:46:06,519
pitching or playing ball, I don't have

777
00:46:06,719 --> 00:46:08,680
a hat on and when...
I'm not waiting an hour

778
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:11,158
Well then I suggest you handle it.

779
00:46:11,358 --> 00:46:14,200
No no no no no no, I'm looking at it

780
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:15,736
right now and let me
tell you one thing pal,

781
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:20,118
my hair has no luster. Luster, yes, yes,

782
00:46:20,318 --> 00:46:22,439
that's right, Nick Fowler's fans expect

783
00:46:22,639 --> 00:46:24,959
his hair to have luster.

784
00:46:25,159 --> 00:46:29,480
- Anything.
- Elizabeth?

785
00:46:31,159 --> 00:46:32,800
I'm trying to talk...

786
00:46:33,119 --> 00:46:34,456
Yeah, well, I have a meeting and I'd like

787
00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:35,814
to show up looking like something other

788
00:46:35,838 --> 00:46:37,398
than a big yellow wall. Don't even talk

789
00:46:37,519 --> 00:46:39,638
to me about the shoes
- always looks good.

790
00:46:39,838 --> 00:46:41,240
So you want to look good like Nick

791
00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:43,720
- Fowler,
- Yeah, well, I'm here

792
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:45,319
Let me ask you one thing Okay

793
00:46:45,519 --> 00:46:47,079
how do you expect me to get a hair care

794
00:46:47,119 --> 00:46:50,039
product endorsement
if my ♪♪♪meal♪♪♪ is dull

795
00:46:50,239 --> 00:46:51,720
Hello?

796
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:53,495
Yeah I'm looking at it from the back and

797
00:46:53,519 --> 00:46:54,856
let me tell you something it doesn't

798
00:46:54,880 --> 00:46:56,269
look any better.

799
00:46:56,469 --> 00:47:04,469
Just your average Joe.

800
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:35,334
- Do you have any???
- I mean, not with me.

801
00:47:35,358 --> 00:47:37,979
Right now, I mean

802
00:47:38,179 --> 00:47:46,179
- Maybe.
- Yeah?

803
00:47:58,559 --> 00:48:01,319
Great Nick, save the ballpark. Elizabeth!

804
00:48:01,519 --> 00:48:02,839

805
00:48:03,039 --> 00:48:05,638

806
00:48:05,838 --> 00:48:07,638

- Nick I don't want to

807
00:48:07,679 --> 00:48:11,479
take any pictures
- No, you look great.

808
00:48:11,679 --> 00:48:13,175
All right, let's have the family reunion.

809
00:48:13,199 --> 00:48:14,760
Family reunion's up; let's go.

810

00:48:23,039 --> 00:48:24,519
Mike that's not it
what's going on?

815
00:48:24,719 --> 00:48:26,055
That's not right.
Well that was a ferris

816
00:48:26,079 --> 00:48:26,986
wheel and there's the courthouse

817
00:48:27,010 --> 00:48:29,240
excuse me can you give us a second please

818
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:31,095
- all right

819
00:48:31,119 --> 00:48:32,294
it what do you just sit there could you

820
00:48:32,318 --> 00:48:35,479
give us a second
- Nick skip it

821
00:48:35,679 --> 00:48:37,158
skip it.

822
00:48:37,358 --> 00:48:38,456
Look I just want to know, is this going

823
00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:40,519
to last much longer?
- Well I don't know

824
00:48:40,719 --> 00:48:42,439
I mean I think there's got a few more picks

825
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:43,896
to take and then I thought after we'd

826
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:45,334
have some dinner with you know some of

827
00:48:45,358 --> 00:48:47,479
these guys, with the photographer
Okay

828
00:48:47,679 --> 00:48:49,399
and some of the other people
Okay well

829
00:48:49,599 --> 00:48:50,776
Do you mind if I meet you later cause

830
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:51,880
I was hoping to see Maggie,

831
00:48:52,079 --> 00:48:53,199
maybe do something with her.

832
00:48:53,358 --> 00:48:55,399
- Maggie? but she takes classes
- what kind

833
00:48:55,599 --> 00:48:57,399
of classes?
- The kind of classes people

834
00:48:57,599 --> 00:48:59,240
take when they've got nothing better to

835
00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:01,740
do with their lives

836
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:25,015
You know, like I saw Nick's sister

837
00:49:25,039 --> 00:49:26,294
the other day and I think that all she

838
00:49:26,318 --> 00:49:27,478
really needs is just a little

839
00:49:27,599 --> 00:49:29,399
encouragement and she really blossoms.

840
00:49:29,599 --> 00:49:31,015
That's pretty much true for everybody

841
00:49:31,039 --> 00:49:32,919
though...

842
00:49:33,119 --> 00:49:34,695
I don't know, I don't
think it happens to me.

843
00:49:34,719 --> 00:49:36,919
Sometimes I never feel inspired

844
00:49:37,119 --> 00:49:37,638
Come on

845
00:49:37,838 --> 00:49:39,095
- what?
- I want to say you're a great

846
00:49:39,119 --> 00:49:41,638
producer that has to take at least

847
00:49:41,838 --> 00:49:44,439
some inspiration you know...
- What about you and...

848
00:49:44,639 --> 00:49:46,680
I mean, if you don't mind my asking

849
00:49:46,880 --> 00:49:50,200
- how did you two fall in love?

850
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:52,600
We fall in love... um

851
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:54,200
I don't know...

852
00:49:55,358 --> 00:49:56,839
It was a gradual thing. We were

853
00:49:57,039 --> 00:49:58,680
acquaintances and then

854
00:49:58,880 --> 00:50:01,319
friends and then best friends

855
00:50:01,519 --> 00:50:03,158
and uh...

856
00:50:03,358 --> 00:50:04,999
best friends who kiss on the mouth.

857
00:50:05,199 --> 00:50:07,560
Oh, it was just perfect.

858
00:50:07,760 --> 00:50:08,359
I mean...

859
00:50:08,559 --> 00:50:09,800
wasn't it?

860
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:11,080
I mean.

861
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:12,839
When I first met her,

862
00:50:13,039 --> 00:50:14,376
she wasn't a producer, didn't want to be

863
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:15,959
a producer but uh...

864
00:50:16,159 --> 00:50:18,600
I encouraged her, I knew she could do it.

865
00:50:18,800 --> 00:50:20,215
You know that's what it is about you.

866
00:50:20,239 --> 00:50:21,319
What?

867
00:50:21,519 --> 00:50:22,959
Just the way that you put your faith

868
00:50:23,119 --> 00:50:24,439
into people. It's like you are

869
00:50:24,639 --> 00:50:27,639
inspiration

870
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:29,638
I... I think it's really just about

871
00:50:29,838 --> 00:50:31,479
being there for each other.

872
00:50:31,679 --> 00:50:33,839
But believe me, without her I'd be nothing.

873
00:50:34,318 --> 00:50:37,158
- You don't think so!
- Yeah I... I know so.

874
00:50:37,358 --> 00:50:38,358
Trust me.

875
00:50:38,480 --> 00:50:40,040
Wait, let's just stop talking about me.

876
00:50:40,079 --> 00:50:41,158
Okay.

877
00:50:41,358 --> 00:50:43,000
About you guys.

878
00:50:44,079 --> 00:50:45,175
Isn't he gonna sign with the Brooklyn

879
00:50:45,199 --> 00:50:47,319
Dodgers next year or what?
- Oh let's not

880
00:50:47,519 --> 00:50:49,269
talk about Nick.
- How come?

881
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:04,000
I did, 't think you'd be home so soon.

882
00:51:11,679 --> 00:51:12,999
Good night.

883
00:51:13,199 --> 00:51:14,199
Good night.

884
00:51:14,239 --> 00:51:18,358
- Good night.
- Good night.

885
00:51:23,199 --> 00:51:24,999
We got to talk.

886
00:51:25,199 --> 00:51:26,839
Yeah I think so.

887
00:51:27,039 --> 00:51:28,839
- I don't get you.
- Me?

888
00:51:29,039 --> 00:51:30,519
You don't get me? what don't you get

889
00:51:30,639 --> 00:51:32,039
about me?

890
00:51:32,239 --> 00:51:34,200
- You want a list?
- There is nothing not to

891
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:36,118
get about me Nick, I'm the most gettable

892
00:51:36,318 --> 00:51:38,280
person you're ever gonna meet.

893
00:51:38,480 --> 00:51:39,480
Yeah

894
00:51:39,679 --> 00:51:40,280
Okay.

895
00:51:40,480 --> 00:51:42,000
First, let's start with these. I found

896
00:51:42,159 --> 00:51:44,839
these letters in this brown jacket.

897
00:51:45,039 --> 00:51:46,439
Why are people offering to give you

898
00:51:46,480 --> 00:51:48,439
things - a free gift for you - what other

899
00:51:48,639 --> 00:51:50,519
kind of gift is there? And can you

900
00:51:50,719 --> 00:51:52,439
explain to me exactly why this is

901
00:51:52,639 --> 00:51:54,839
written backwards?

902
00:51:55,039 --> 00:51:58,359
Nick, give it a rest, it's junk mail.

903
00:51:58,559 --> 00:52:00,280
"Junk mail", "free gifts", what is this?

904
00:52:00,480 --> 00:52:01,959
Elizabeth code?

905
00:52:02,159 --> 00:52:04,519
And I also found

906
00:52:04,719 --> 00:52:08,118
this little puppy onto that Joe fella?

907
00:52:08,318 --> 00:52:10,960
Give me that.

908
00:52:12,719 --> 00:52:15,560
Why are you getting his backward letters?

909
00:52:15,760 --> 00:52:18,039
It's from Dartmouth College. He applied

910
00:52:18,239 --> 00:52:19,655
for a research grant and they're gonna

911
00:52:19,679 --> 00:52:21,399
fund it. He never told...

912
00:52:21,599 --> 00:52:22,839
Well, maybe he did.

913
00:52:23,039 --> 00:52:24,294
Is it that Dartmouth College that

914
00:52:24,318 --> 00:52:25,798
advertises on the side of the buses?

915
00:52:26,790 --> 00:52:27,790
No, a different one.

916
00:52:27,920 --> 00:52:29,879
Right. So why exactly would you be

917
00:52:30,079 --> 00:52:32,919
calling us all of a sudden?

918
00:52:33,119 --> 00:52:34,519
Yeah.

919
00:52:34,719 --> 00:52:36,839
Yeah whatever

920
00:52:37,039 --> 00:52:39,479
- It's Peg
- Who?

921
00:52:39,679 --> 00:52:41,318
Your mother.

922
00:52:42,559 --> 00:52:44,920
Nick, you know my mother died when I was...

923
00:52:49,599 --> 00:52:50,919
Yeah...

924
00:52:51,119 --> 00:52:52,200
Nick.

925
00:52:52,400 --> 00:52:55,240
When was the shot for cancer invented?

926
00:52:57,838 --> 00:52:59,399
30 years ago?

927
00:52:59,599 --> 00:53:02,000
Oh, my God.

928
00:53:38,960 --> 00:53:40,960
Mom.

929
00:54:00,639 --> 00:54:02,500
I remember this set from when I was a kid.

930
00:54:02,600 --> 00:54:05,359
Oh, I've had this forever.
The cookie jar too.

931
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:08,680
I know the cookie jar

932
00:54:08,880 --> 00:54:11,399
and your perfume.

933
00:54:11,599 --> 00:54:14,800
I had forgotten your perfume.

934
00:54:16,480 --> 00:54:18,760
Do you remember how I used to spray it

935
00:54:18,960 --> 00:54:20,076
on the dog when you were little.

936
00:54:20,100 --> 00:54:24,000
I know how ridiculous you thought I was.

937
00:54:25,760 --> 00:54:28,118
You were at my high school graduation?

938
00:54:28,318 --> 00:54:30,000
- Well of course you were.
- What?

939
00:54:30,100 --> 00:54:32,680
- My high school graduation.
- Oh,

940
00:54:32,880 --> 00:54:33,959
yes

941
00:54:34,159 --> 00:54:36,550
and you wanted to wear shorts

942
00:54:36,760 --> 00:54:38,999
under your gown instead of that nice dress.

943
00:54:39,199 --> 00:54:40,839
What color was it?

944
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:45,638
- I don't remember exactly.
- Blue.

945
00:54:45,838 --> 00:54:48,760
I think with with lace, oh

946
00:54:48,960 --> 00:54:52,760
you hated that lace.
Not sophisticated enough

947
00:54:52,960 --> 00:54:55,399
We went around and found about that one.

948
00:54:55,599 --> 00:54:57,158
Aunt Charlotte too.

949
00:54:57,358 --> 00:54:59,838
We won.

950
00:55:02,079 --> 00:55:04,000
What's wrong?

951
00:55:04,880 --> 00:55:07,240
Nothing.

952
00:55:07,440 --> 00:55:09,638
It's good to talk to you,

953
00:55:09,838 --> 00:55:11,558
to see you again.

954
00:55:12,798 --> 00:55:15,010
It's been too many years.

955
00:55:22,960 --> 00:55:24,280
Here's one with you and your aunt

956
00:55:24,400 --> 00:55:28,720
Charlotte, oh you two were really team.

957
00:55:30,079 --> 00:55:34,039
Oh, there we are.

958
00:55:34,318 --> 00:55:35,970
Why haven't we spoken?

959
00:55:37,760 --> 00:55:39,959
It doesn't matter anymore.

960
00:55:40,159 --> 00:55:42,399
God knows mothers and
daughters fight sometimes,

961
00:55:43,039 --> 00:55:46,359
more than sometimes if the truth were known

962
00:55:46,960 --> 00:55:48,919
and it was probably my fault for making

963
00:55:49,119 --> 00:55:52,400
you choose between Nick and me.

964
00:55:53,760 --> 00:55:54,986
Well, I'm gonna put these away,

965
00:55:55,010 --> 00:55:57,050
I don't want to spoil the day.
- No no it's not that

966
00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:01,800
What is it, Sweetie?

967
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:03,600
I was thinking about this friend of mine

968
00:56:05,039 --> 00:56:07,959
whose mom died of cancer
- Cancer?

969
00:56:08,159 --> 00:56:10,200
Didn't she get the shot?

970
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:13,680
No, she didn't get the shot.

971
00:56:14,079 --> 00:56:15,495
My friend knew that her mom was dying

972
00:56:15,519 --> 00:56:17,680
and she wanted to be in the room with her.

973
00:56:19,440 --> 00:56:20,936
She wanted to be able to hold her hand

974
00:56:20,960 --> 00:56:22,456
when it happened but they wouldn't let

975
00:56:22,480 --> 00:56:23,769
her in the room.

976
00:56:25,679 --> 00:56:29,480
They wouldn't let her say goodbye.

977
00:56:33,679 --> 00:56:36,480
Happily ever after is highly overrated

978
00:57:13,280 --> 00:57:16,680
Well I guess I'd better get back.

979
00:57:16,880 --> 00:57:18,519
You don't sound too thrilled.

980
00:57:18,719 --> 00:57:20,135
Well, you know, you never know what Nick

981
00:57:20,159 --> 00:57:21,879
has lined up.

982
00:57:23,838 --> 00:57:26,039
Can I say something here? This... this is

983
00:57:26,239 --> 00:57:28,439
maybe none of my business.

984
00:57:28,639 --> 00:57:29,720
You guys

985
00:57:29,920 --> 00:57:31,560
need to talk about things.

986
00:57:31,760 --> 00:57:33,709
Things?

987
00:57:34,159 --> 00:57:36,439
You, know tell him that you love him

988
00:57:36,639 --> 00:57:38,598
I do love him

989
00:57:38,798 --> 00:57:39,798
So you're...

990
00:57:39,838 --> 00:57:41,720
you're beautiful, you're intelligent.

991
00:57:41,920 --> 00:57:43,280
You think so?

992
00:57:44,480 --> 00:57:47,119
I know so

993
00:57:47,358 --> 00:57:48,680
and if you guys love each other

994
00:57:48,880 --> 00:57:50,359
and you're meant to be together,

995
00:57:50,559 --> 00:57:52,359
you'll do whatever it takes.

996
00:57:52,559 --> 00:57:55,839
Whatever it takes?

997
00:57:55,920 --> 00:57:57,334
You don't know how happy I am to hear

998
00:57:57,358 --> 00:57:58,430
you say that.

999
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,439
In Einstein's opinion, time has no space

1000
00:58:02,639 --> 00:58:04,919
nor boundaries and thus was constantly

1001
00:58:05,119 --> 00:58:07,479
interchangeable with no set rules.

1002
00:58:07,679 --> 00:58:09,319
There are conceivably an infinite number

1003
00:58:09,519 --> 00:58:11,879
of worlds being created every second
- Hi!

1004
00:58:12,079 --> 00:58:14,439
Each one filled with new scenarios
- Oh, hi.

1005
00:58:14,639 --> 00:58:17,158
Einstein, huh?
- Uh-huh.

1006
00:58:17,358 --> 00:58:19,840
Boy he's on the show a lot.

1007
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:23,638
Given the basic principles underlying

1008
00:58:23,838 --> 00:58:25,958
Einstein's theory...
- How's it going with you and Joe

1009
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:28,760
- oh great
- alternative...
- Good.

1010
00:58:28,960 --> 00:58:31,720
He sure likes you a lot.
- Oh

1011
00:58:31,920 --> 00:58:34,159
Yes... Work!

1012
00:58:34,838 --> 00:58:36,999
Listen, do you think he might be?

1013
00:58:37,199 --> 00:58:41,199
Popped the question anytime soon no?

1014
00:58:41,599 --> 00:58:44,280
Well, you know that's probably
for the best because

1015
00:58:44,480 --> 00:58:45,976
you don't want to rush into these things,

1016
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:47,720
especially if you're feeling it

1017
00:58:47,920 --> 00:58:50,000
all uncertainty

1018
00:58:50,120 --> 00:58:53,000
Believe me Alannah,
Marriage is no big relax...

1019
00:58:53,760 --> 00:58:55,319
it's a lot of hard work.

1020
00:58:55,519 --> 00:58:56,774
You shouldn't do it unless you're

1021
00:58:56,798 --> 00:58:59,080
absolutely ready.

1022
00:58:59,280 --> 00:59:00,280
Yeah?

1023
00:59:00,400 --> 00:59:02,720
Yeah.

1024
00:59:05,679 --> 00:59:07,080
- Hi Sandy.
- Hi

1025
00:59:07,280 --> 00:59:08,359
What's down?

1026
00:59:08,559 --> 00:59:10,760
More than meets the eye it seems like.

1027
00:59:10,960 --> 00:59:12,760
I need your signature.

1028
00:59:12,960 --> 00:59:14,135
Mighty interesting advice you were

1029
00:59:14,159 --> 00:59:15,240
giving Alannah.

1030
00:59:17,440 --> 00:59:19,440
Vee - Guess - Abta

1031
00:59:20,480 --> 00:59:22,000
What's with this habit of writing your

1032
00:59:22,159 --> 00:59:24,960
name backwards?

1033
00:59:28,159 --> 00:59:29,720
Sandy, what would you say if I told you

1034
00:59:29,920 --> 00:59:31,959
that I was from an

1035
00:59:32,159 --> 00:59:33,638
alternate universe?

1036
00:59:33,838 --> 00:59:35,638
Oh, come on.

1037
00:59:35,838 --> 00:59:38,798
<i>It is quite possible</i>

1038
00:59:39,280 --> 00:59:41,240
You're serious.

1039
00:59:41,440 --> 00:59:43,080
Let's put it this way. I'm not the same

1040
00:59:43,280 --> 00:59:45,399
Beth that you knew
- and who's Beth?

1041
00:59:45,599 --> 00:59:47,560
- I'm Beth.
- No you're Elizabeth.

1042
00:59:47,760 --> 00:59:49,479
<i>Given the basic principles underlying</i>

1043
00:59:49,679 --> 00:59:51,800
<i>Einstein's theory of relativity it is</i>

1044
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:53,720
<i>quite possible that alternate universes</i>

1045
00:59:53,920 --> 00:59:55,080
<i>exist.</i>

1046
00:59:55,280 --> 00:59:57,080
<i>Einstein believed that alternate worlds</i>

1047
00:59:57,280 --> 00:59:58,439
<i>were logical,</i>

1048
00:59:58,639 --> 01:00:00,519
<i>indeed possible.</i>

1049
01:00:00,719 --> 01:00:03,080
<i>In Einstein's opinion time has no space</i>

1050
01:00:03,280 --> 01:00:05,800
<i>nor boundaries and thus was constantly</i>

1051
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:08,039
<i>interchangeable with no sense</i>

1052
01:00:08,239 --> 01:00:10,359
This is really tricky so
are you like inhabiting

1053
01:00:10,559 --> 01:00:12,598
her body or something?
- I don't know maybe

1054
01:00:12,798 --> 01:00:14,718
we just switched places
- so in your universe,

1055
01:00:14,798 --> 01:00:16,200
you're not Elizabeth you're Beth

1056
01:00:16,400 --> 01:00:18,839
- yeah
- and Beth is a total rat who

1057
01:00:19,039 --> 01:00:20,519
would make a play for someone else's

1058
01:00:20,719 --> 01:00:22,280
boyfriend which is what you're doing

1059
01:00:22,480 --> 01:00:25,780
here even though you're Elizabeth.

1060
01:00:27,480 --> 01:00:29,480
Further explanation may be required.

1061
01:00:46,480 --> 01:00:48,280
No I swear, I have never heard of them,

1062
01:00:48,480 --> 01:00:50,200
not Regis nor Kathie Lee.
- Well they

1063
01:00:50,400 --> 01:00:52,200
consistently beat our show in any market

1064
01:00:52,400 --> 01:00:53,976
where we go head to head
- but our show is

1065
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:55,655
one top honor
- yeah but in the other world,

1066
01:00:55,679 --> 01:00:58,598
our show's stupid
- Oh boomer

1067
01:00:58,798 --> 01:01:02,598
- but you're the boss
- yeah?

1068
01:01:02,798 --> 01:01:04,760
- On a stupid show?
- Yeah but you don't care...

1069
01:01:04,960 --> 01:01:07,158
- because?
- Because you make lots of money

1070
01:01:07,358 --> 01:01:08,919
We're producing a show that's stupid.

1071
01:01:12,159 --> 01:01:14,200
So, you're dating Alannah's boyfriend in

1072
01:01:14,400 --> 01:01:17,080
the other world
- No no Alannah is dating my

1073
01:01:17,280 --> 01:01:18,500
boyfriend in this world

1074
01:01:18,600 --> 01:01:20,519
But you've got Nick.

1075
01:01:21,760 --> 01:01:23,999
What's so special about
this Joe guy anyway?

1076
01:01:24,798 --> 01:01:26,200
Nothing.

1077
01:01:26,400 --> 01:01:28,439
Absolutely nothing.

1078
01:01:28,639 --> 01:01:30,359

pitcher for the Havana Rebels

1091

01:02:07,039 --> 01:02:08,200
- Yes
- Okay what about

1093
01:02:08,400 --> 01:02:10,359
Iowa or Missouri?

1094
01:02:10,559 --> 01:02:11,800
Both yes.

1095
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:13,560
See I've been going over the map

1096
01:02:13,760 --> 01:02:15,095
in my head and I can't figure out which

1097
01:02:15,119 --> 01:02:18,200

1098
01:02:18,400 --> 01:02:21,080
- Excuse me
- Oh, hi.

- No no.

1100
01:02:25,519 --> 01:02:27,479
Oops, suddenly got crowded in here.

01:02:27,679 --> 01:02:29,575
- Nice to see you
- I didn't know you were coming

1102
01:02:29,599 --> 01:02:30,839

1103
01:02:31,039 --> 01:02:32,919
Well, actually, I didn't. I came to uh

01:02:33,119 --> 01:02:34,598

1105
01:02:34,798 --> 01:02:36,598

Yeah we're finishing the treatment.

1107
01:02:38,159 --> 01:02:39,159
Treatment

1108
01:02:39,280 --> 01:02:40,280
Oh,

1109
01:02:40,318 --> 01:02:41,560

1110
01:02:41,760 --> 01:02:45,439
I was um gonna have
lunch in my office anyway

1111
01:02:46,159 --> 01:02:48,200

01:02:49,599 --> 01:02:53,640
to do.
- Okay um... I'll call you.

1114
01:03:02,559 --> 01:03:03,896
Is there some place we can go and talk

1115
01:03:03,920 --> 01:03:05,399
in private?

1116
01:03:05,599 --> 01:03:08,039
Yeah um...

1117
01:03:08,239 --> 01:03:09,655

- Okay.

1118
01:03:09,679 --> 01:03:10,679
Follow me

01:03:13,039 --> 01:03:14,760

1121
01:03:14,960 --> 01:03:16,456
water or
- no I'm fine, I'm just making

1122
01:03:16,480 --> 01:03:18,200
protein logs or bread, do you want lunch

1123
01:03:18,400 --> 01:03:20,720
Brett!

1124
01:03:27,280 --> 01:03:28,774
You know I feel like we've really hit it

1125
01:03:28,798 --> 01:03:30,680
off the last couple days, am I am I right?

1126
01:03:30,880 --> 01:03:33,879
- Oh yeah yeah
- and um

1127
01:03:34,079 --> 01:03:37,839
I hope this isn't inappropriate but

1128
01:03:38,079 --> 01:03:40,500
I wanted to ask you...

1129
01:03:42,400 --> 01:03:44,838
Do you think Alannah would like this?

1130
01:03:49,039 --> 01:03:51,439
Every time I think he's
gonna pop the question,

1131
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:53,240
I just...

1132
01:03:53,440 --> 01:03:54,680
shut down

1133
01:03:54,880 --> 01:03:55,560
I'm...

1134
01:03:55,760 --> 01:03:57,943
I don't want to be my mother.

1135
01:03:58,639 --> 01:04:01,720
I have plans, I have dreams.
Why can't it just

1136
01:04:01,920 --> 01:04:04,039
stay the way it is and I could have

1137
01:04:04,239 --> 01:04:06,519
the best of both worlds?

1138
01:04:06,719 --> 01:04:08,680
I deserve to have it all, don't you think?

1139
01:04:08,880 --> 01:04:11,119
Oh, absolutely.

1140
01:04:14,960 --> 01:04:16,118
You saw it.

1141
01:04:16,318 --> 01:04:18,280
You actually saw this ring?

1142
01:04:18,480 --> 01:04:20,519
Was it big? Oh forget I asked that

1143
01:04:20,719 --> 01:04:22,734
what difference is this?
- Alannah

1144
01:04:22,840 --> 01:04:24,859
- what?
- It was big.

1145
01:04:24,883 --> 01:04:27,720
Oh I knew it would be.

1146
01:04:27,920 --> 01:04:29,495
He probably has it hidden around the house

1147
01:04:29,519 --> 01:04:31,781
someplace huh?
- In a sock drawer.

1148
01:04:33,119 --> 01:04:34,838
Or someplace.

1149
01:04:36,318 --> 01:04:37,879
I just wish

1150
01:04:38,079 --> 01:04:40,598
that I knew that he was the...

1151
01:04:40,798 --> 01:04:42,519
Because if I say no or just let me think

1152
01:04:42,719 --> 01:04:44,294
about it, it's probably going to be over

1153
01:04:44,318 --> 01:04:47,400
between us
- You think so?

1154
01:04:52,480 --> 01:04:53,480
So um...

1155
01:04:53,599 --> 01:04:55,256
what do you think I should do about this?

1156
01:04:55,280 --> 01:04:57,798
Hey, let me think about it.

1157
01:05:02,318 --> 01:05:02,839
Hi

1158
01:05:03,039 --> 01:05:04,679
Hi,
- I thought you're at work, I was just

1159
01:05:04,719 --> 01:05:06,863
on my way out
- oh it's monday.

1160
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:09,720
- Oh monday
- yeah, so I thought I'd

1161
01:05:09,920 --> 01:05:12,118
come over and um talk to you

1162
01:05:12,318 --> 01:05:14,519
- Oh about the article
- and things

1163
01:05:14,719 --> 01:05:17,279
Cool, come in.

1164
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:27,500
So, uh...

1165
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:29,500
So...

1166
01:05:34,719 --> 01:05:38,118
- Dog lover huh?
- I love dogs. Hi, Jefferson.

1167
01:05:38,318 --> 01:05:39,800
No it's... it's Rover.

1168
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:42,200
- Rover?
- After the president.

1169
01:05:42,400 --> 01:05:43,896
Everybody ready but he's here.
We've got

1170
01:05:43,920 --> 01:05:45,720
a little wrinkly head here.

1171
01:05:45,920 --> 01:05:48,480
What did you want?

1172
01:05:48,960 --> 01:05:52,000
You want to talk about it?

1173
01:05:52,079 --> 01:05:54,359
Oh, hey, okay.

1174
01:05:54,559 --> 01:05:56,919
- I don't know what that was
- it was us

1175
01:05:57,119 --> 01:05:58,200
and it was right.

1176
01:05:58,400 --> 01:06:00,600
- I'd love someone else.
- No you don't realize it now

1177
01:06:00,700 --> 01:06:02,439
but, Joe, you actually love me.

1178
01:06:02,639 --> 01:06:04,919
- I love Alannah
- no you think she's uh

1179
01:06:05,119 --> 01:06:07,638
she's uh gaskinated.
- Gaskinated?

1180
01:06:07,838 --> 01:06:09,334
You know from the crossword,
one who boasts and brags.

1181
01:06:09,358 --> 01:06:10,680
What are you talking about?

1182
01:06:10,880 --> 01:06:12,456
I'm sorry Joe I didn't realize it till now

1183
01:06:12,480 --> 01:06:14,760
but I want you.
- Okay you're married all right

1184
01:06:14,960 --> 01:06:16,359
you don't really know me though

1185
01:06:16,559 --> 01:06:18,519
But I do!

1186
01:06:18,719 --> 01:06:20,118
And I miss you

1187
01:06:20,318 --> 01:06:21,814
I miss the way that you move your head

1188
01:06:21,838 --> 01:06:23,334
back and forth when you brush your teeth

1189
01:06:23,358 --> 01:06:24,999
in the bathroom and I miss the way that

1190
01:06:25,199 --> 01:06:26,519
you cry every time you hear Sarah

1191
01:06:26,719 --> 01:06:28,055
Vaughan sing that song that you love,

1192
01:06:28,079 --> 01:06:29,559
you know what song I'm talking about.

1193
01:06:29,599 --> 01:06:30,999
Come on you know your grandma

1194
01:06:31,199 --> 01:06:32,615
taught it to you and I miss the way that

1195
01:06:32,639 --> 01:06:33,814
you dance around your underwear every

1196
01:06:33,838 --> 01:06:35,999
time you hear Chaka Khan come on the radio

1197
01:06:37,838 --> 01:06:39,256
Okay, how do you know I
dance around the room to shock

1198
01:06:39,280 --> 01:06:41,240
- Come here
- no

1199
01:06:41,440 --> 01:06:43,399
but Joe I'm sorry I was so rapid myself

1200
01:06:43,599 --> 01:06:45,159
I didn't even realize that you'd shaved

1201
01:06:45,280 --> 01:06:47,399
off your goatee
- goatee?
- and he probably

1202
01:06:47,599 --> 01:06:49,175
told me about the grand at Dartmouth and

1203
01:06:49,199 --> 01:06:50,839
I just didn't hear it
- Dartmouth?

1204
01:06:51,039 --> 01:06:52,995
Well they want you and I want you.

1205
01:06:53,019 --> 01:06:55,080
Dartmouth is a trade
school for dental assistants.

1206
01:06:55,280 --> 01:06:56,999
Okay but this is obviously my fault and

1207
01:06:57,199 --> 01:06:58,456
I sent you the wrong signal that's Okay

1208
01:06:58,480 --> 01:07:00,839
but I'm really sorry really
- look Joe Joe

1209
01:07:01,039 --> 01:07:02,439
I have the letter you just got from

1210
01:07:02,480 --> 01:07:03,840
Dartmouth, that's for Joe Townsend

1211
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:05,720
It's a letter for another Joe not me Okay?

1212
01:07:05,760 --> 01:07:07,175
I suggest you find him,
you give this to him,

1213
01:07:07,199 --> 01:07:08,359
you'd be very encouraging and

1214
01:07:08,400 --> 01:07:10,039
supportive of him and his pursuit of a

1215
01:07:10,239 --> 01:07:12,760
career in dental hygiene. Okay?

1216
01:07:12,960 --> 01:07:14,839
Bye now.

1217
01:07:15,039 --> 01:07:16,039
Oh.

1218
01:07:16,159 --> 01:07:17,159
Okay, Beth.

1219
01:07:17,358 --> 01:07:20,880
It really is time to wake up now.

1220
01:07:26,159 --> 01:07:29,920
Please be a normal airplane...

1221
01:07:37,039 --> 01:07:38,680
You okay?

1222
01:07:38,880 --> 01:07:41,080
- I'm fine I'm fine
- all right, Alannah called.

1223
01:07:41,280 --> 01:07:42,919
She knows you're here.
- Well good I want

1224
01:07:43,119 --> 01:07:44,294
to talk to her I think it's time we had

1225
01:07:44,318 --> 01:07:45,879
this whole thing out she has to

1226
01:07:46,079 --> 01:07:47,575
understand that I believe that certain

1227
01:07:47,599 --> 01:07:49,495
things are meant to be
- about your mother

1228
01:07:49,519 --> 01:07:51,175
- What about my mother?
- Alannah doesn't quite

1229
01:07:51,199 --> 01:07:55,879
understand but they've sent for a doctor.

1230
01:07:56,400 --> 01:07:58,999
She's here, she's here.

1231
01:07:59,199 --> 01:08:00,999
Oh Elizabeth.

1232
01:08:01,199 --> 01:08:02,598
I came over to see if there was

1233
01:08:02,798 --> 01:08:04,456
anything I could do with...
Elizabeth I am

1234
01:08:04,480 --> 01:08:07,319
so sorry
- I'm Dr Ramy

1235
01:08:07,519 --> 01:08:08,959
it's really better you don't see her

1236
01:08:09,039 --> 01:08:10,839
right now
- no you don't understand I have

1237
01:08:10,960 --> 01:08:12,919
to see her where is she?
- Oh let her see me

1238
01:08:13,119 --> 01:08:16,319
for Petes's sake.
- Mom!

1239
01:08:17,119 --> 01:08:18,440
Easy you don't want the rope

1240
01:08:18,640 --> 01:08:20,038
to come open.

1241
01:08:20,238 --> 01:08:21,879
I thought you were...

1242
01:08:22,079 --> 01:08:23,958
I am...

1243
01:08:24,158 --> 01:08:25,496
that's why I was trying to get a holdi♪♪♪

1244
01:08:25,520 --> 01:08:26,919
in the first place.

1245
01:08:27,119 --> 01:08:29,919
Oh sweetheart, this
happens to a lot of people.

1246
01:08:31,198 --> 01:08:32,839
You get a good deal on some real estate

1247
01:08:33,039 --> 01:08:35,958
and you have to make hard choices.

1248
01:08:36,158 --> 01:08:38,598
- What?
- I'm going to Cuba.

1249
01:08:38,798 --> 01:08:40,214
I was on the statehood committee and

1250
01:08:40,238 --> 01:08:41,638
they gave me a good deal on some

1251
01:08:41,838 --> 01:08:44,038
beachfront and I'm moving.
6 I kind of got

1252
01:08:44,238 --> 01:08:45,800
the message wrong, I'm really sorry.

1253
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:47,559
Elizabeth I mean they said they were

1254
01:08:47,759 --> 01:08:49,638
rushing it out...
- I put off everything till

1255
01:08:49,838 --> 01:08:51,400
the last day I was supposed to have a

1256
01:08:51,600 --> 01:08:53,159
physical for the visa weeks ago.

1257
01:08:53,359 --> 01:08:54,359
Sorry, Elizabeth.

1258
01:08:54,399 --> 01:08:56,038
Hold on, hold on.

1259
01:08:56,238 --> 01:08:58,119
Cuba?

1260
01:08:58,319 --> 01:08:59,814
Sweetheart, there's no
reason to be this upset.

1261
01:08:59,838 --> 01:09:01,159
We can see each other as much as

1262
01:09:01,359 --> 01:09:03,159
you want. You can visit you, come there.

1263
01:09:03,359 --> 01:09:05,174
I come here, we can
talk every day if you want.

1264
01:09:05,198 --> 01:09:07,879
Oh, let me give you my new number.

1265
01:09:10,640 --> 01:09:13,400
<i>Cinco cinco cinco...</i>
- mom do you have to go?

1266
01:09:16,640 --> 01:09:18,760
No I mean it. I don't want you to go.

1267
01:09:18,960 --> 01:09:21,079
I want you to stay and I want us to

1268
01:09:21,279 --> 01:09:22,998
be together and and make everything like

1269
01:09:23,198 --> 01:09:24,839
it should have been all along I'm...

1270
01:09:25,039 --> 01:09:27,159
That's what I want.

1271
01:09:27,359 --> 01:09:28,760
It's funny.

1272
01:09:28,960 --> 01:09:30,519
After you left the other day I thought

1273
01:09:30,719 --> 01:09:32,279
why would she tell me that story about

1274
01:09:32,479 --> 01:09:34,680
the girl whose mother died?

1275
01:09:34,880 --> 01:09:37,320
Then it hit me.

1276
01:09:37,520 --> 01:09:39,640
It was about us, right?

1277
01:09:41,600 --> 01:09:43,080
Growing up, you got the double whammy

1278
01:09:43,198 --> 01:09:45,159
kiddo that's for sure.

1279
01:09:45,359 --> 01:09:46,760
Your father left,

1280
01:09:46,960 --> 01:09:48,720
then I got so hung up
with my own tough luck

1281
01:09:50,399 --> 01:09:53,119
I forgot there was another
person in the house.

1282
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:55,400
The two people you loved the most

1283
01:09:55,600 --> 01:09:57,400
pulled away from you.

1284
01:09:57,600 --> 01:09:59,040
Some ways I might as well have died.

1285
01:09:59,198 --> 01:10:01,479
Don't say that!
I saw the pictures of us.

1286
01:10:01,679 --> 01:10:03,800
Oh don't kid me, I watched you.

1287
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:05,095
It was like you were staring

1288
01:10:05,119 --> 01:10:06,839
at strangers in those pictures.

1289
01:10:07,039 --> 01:10:08,998
Mom do you remember when I was 10?

1290
01:10:09,198 --> 01:10:10,718
You used to say to me "Beth it's a new

1291
01:10:10,800 --> 01:10:12,440
morning put on a nice clean dress and a

1292
01:10:12,640 --> 01:10:14,919
big fat smile and start the day".

1293
01:10:15,119 --> 01:10:16,695
- I said that?
- Yeah and that's what I want us to

1294
01:10:16,719 --> 01:10:18,279
do now. I want us to put on nice clean

1295
01:10:18,479 --> 01:10:20,360
dresses and big fat smiles and start the

1296
01:10:20,560 --> 01:10:23,560
day and everything can be perfect.

1297
01:10:23,760 --> 01:10:26,479
It's never a perfect world Sweetie.

1298
01:10:27,679 --> 01:10:29,320
But that should never stop us from

1299
01:10:29,520 --> 01:10:31,000
trying with all our hearts to make it

1300
01:10:31,119 --> 01:10:32,599
that way.

1301
01:10:42,960 --> 01:10:45,159
In the morning, afternoon, evening,

1302
01:10:45,359 --> 01:10:47,320
whenever you need that extra punch to

1303
01:10:47,520 --> 01:10:48,998
make yourself look good,

1304
01:10:49,198 --> 01:10:51,159
rely on this. You got a date you got

1305
01:10:51,359 --> 01:10:52,680
anything that weekend,

1306
01:10:52,880 --> 01:10:54,919
this lasts like five hours all you gotta

1307
01:10:55,119 --> 01:10:56,919
do is put on some more, no building hang???

1308
01:10:57,119 --> 01:10:59,640
Come on.

1309
01:10:59,840 --> 01:11:02,640
Hang on a minute.

1310
01:11:09,119 --> 01:11:10,119
Hi.

1311
01:11:10,158 --> 01:11:13,199
- Is Nick home?
- Sort of

1312
01:11:14,399 --> 01:11:15,479
uh for my...

1313
01:11:15,679 --> 01:11:17,958
new boss's niece.

1314
01:11:18,158 --> 01:11:20,440
He probably won't get to it today so you

1315
01:11:20,640 --> 01:11:22,119
know, just tell him I'll come back

1316
01:11:22,319 --> 01:11:23,958
tomorrow and pick him up.

1317
01:11:24,158 --> 01:11:26,199
Thank you bye.

1318
01:11:26,399 --> 01:11:28,920
Maggie I saw you tap dancing.

1319
01:11:30,399 --> 01:11:32,038
Nick told me where you took lessons.

1320
01:11:32,238 --> 01:11:34,078
He likes sending people
over for a good laugh.

1321
01:11:34,238 --> 01:11:36,279
No, you were good.

1322
01:11:36,479 --> 01:11:38,799
Really good.

1323
01:11:41,119 --> 01:11:43,000
Thanks.

1324
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:45,320
Maggie,

1325
01:11:45,520 --> 01:11:47,239
do you want to be on television?

1326
01:11:47,439 --> 01:11:50,199
- Me?
- Yeah my show's doing a segment on

1327
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:54,519
ancient tribal dances and I need to find

1328
01:11:54,719 --> 01:11:56,519
somebody to choreograph it and...

1329
01:11:56,719 --> 01:11:58,199
Choreograph?

1330
01:11:58,399 --> 01:12:00,844
Choreograph? I don't
know, I'm not that good.

1331
01:12:01,439 --> 01:12:04,600
- Sure you are.
- Look, I just do it for fun.

1332
01:12:04,800 --> 01:12:06,200
It's not... I'm not professional or

1333
01:12:06,319 --> 01:12:08,840
anything. I don't do it for a living.

1334
01:12:11,039 --> 01:12:13,360
Could I maybe be one of the dancers?

1335
01:12:14,560 --> 01:12:16,199
And do you have costumes

1336
01:12:16,399 --> 01:12:18,199
because I can make them, I could sew.

1337
01:12:18,399 --> 01:12:22,119
- I got clothes in my closet.
- Oh Alannah!

1338
01:12:22,319 --> 01:12:24,119
Listen, did you talk to
Joe about yesterday?

1339
01:12:27,119 --> 01:12:28,119
Well...

1340
01:12:28,319 --> 01:12:30,079
do you still want my advice about this guy?

1341
01:12:31,760 --> 01:12:32,936
I don't think you're
gonna like what I'll say

1342
01:12:32,960 --> 01:12:34,640
but if you're smart, you'll listen.

1343
01:12:34,840 --> 01:12:36,360
You meet me in an hour?

1344
01:12:38,560 --> 01:12:39,239
Okay.

1345
01:12:39,439 --> 01:12:40,600
Okay I'll be here.

1346
01:12:40,800 --> 01:12:45,079
Are you Okay? No not you, bye.

1347
01:12:45,279 --> 01:12:47,079
I gotta go but keep working on it.

1348
01:12:47,279 --> 01:12:49,239
- Was this thing expensive?
- Oh no we got five

1349
01:12:49,439 --> 01:12:51,320
or six of those. I'll see you in an hour

1350
01:12:51,520 --> 01:12:53,079
I mean soon.

1351
01:12:53,279 --> 01:12:55,400
Thanks, bye.

1352
01:12:55,499 --> 01:12:56,539
The plot thickens.

1353
01:13:16,840 --> 01:13:20,038
Jefferson, you don't tell on me, Okay?

1354
01:13:21,439 --> 01:13:23,800
Just remember, I was the one that fed you.

1355
01:13:32,960 --> 01:13:34,360
Good Jefferson.

1356
01:13:34,560 --> 01:13:36,360
Rover, sorry.

1357
01:13:40,319 --> 01:13:42,679
Come on, where are you, where are you?

1358
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:53,000
Yes!

1359
01:14:23,119 --> 01:14:24,616
- Oh how are you doing?
- Good evening sir

1360
01:14:24,640 --> 01:14:27,320
- party of two uh miss uh Alannah
- ah yes.

1361
01:14:27,520 --> 01:14:30,279
- Right, this way,
- Okay

1362
01:14:30,479 --> 01:14:32,479
Great.

1363
01:14:49,840 --> 01:14:52,360
It was a really poorly kept secret that

1364
01:14:52,560 --> 01:14:54,600
you were gonna ask me to marry you

1365
01:14:54,800 --> 01:14:57,400
so uElizabeth convinced me to take the lead

1366
01:14:58,640 --> 01:15:01,920
in case you got hot feet.

1367
01:15:02,319 --> 01:15:05,079
- You dipped all this?
- Yeah

1368
01:15:05,279 --> 01:15:07,320
Would you believe that in some universes

1369
01:15:07,520 --> 01:15:08,856
you couldn't arrange a wedding like this

1370
01:15:08,880 --> 01:15:11,840
in three and a half hours...

1371
01:15:12,960 --> 01:15:15,479
with live entertainment!

1372
01:15:15,679 --> 01:15:16,730
This is unbelievable

1373
01:15:18,719 --> 01:15:20,055
It just shows what you can do with a little

1374
01:15:20,079 --> 01:15:21,320
inspiration.

1375
01:15:21,520 --> 01:15:23,640
She made me realize what was important

1376
01:15:23,840 --> 01:15:27,320
and that I couldn't risk losing you.

1377
01:15:27,520 --> 01:15:30,400
I don't have a ring.

1378
01:15:31,359 --> 01:15:32,359
Good bye.

1379
01:15:32,399 --> 01:15:33,399
You're going?

1380
01:15:33,520 --> 01:15:36,119
- I think it's better if I do.
- For who?

1381
01:15:36,319 --> 01:15:38,199
For me.

1382
01:15:38,399 --> 01:15:40,360
Elizabeth,

1383
01:15:40,560 --> 01:15:42,420
I don't quite know how
to thank you for this.

1384
01:15:42,640 --> 01:15:44,760
But I don't get this

1385
01:15:44,960 --> 01:15:46,536
Well, I have a four by four with an eight

1386
01:15:46,560 --> 01:15:47,896
track and a microwave and I don't get

1387
01:15:47,920 --> 01:15:49,560
that either.

1388
01:15:49,760 --> 01:15:50,760
Look.

1389
01:15:50,800 --> 01:15:52,760
You got a great guy in your life.

1390
01:15:52,960 --> 01:15:54,600
Remember he's the one you want.

1391
01:15:54,800 --> 01:15:55,800
I know.

1392
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:57,335
I just have to figure out how I can get

1393
01:15:57,359 --> 01:15:58,759
back to him.

1394
01:16:12,960 --> 01:16:14,360
This isn't your wedding?

1395
01:16:14,560 --> 01:16:16,560
No, why don't you just rub it in?

1396
01:16:27,840 --> 01:16:29,159
You know the words?

1397
01:16:29,359 --> 01:16:31,560
Oh some of them, I had a boyfriend.

1398
01:16:33,760 --> 01:16:35,440
Oh this guy used to know like that song

1399
01:16:36,640 --> 01:16:38,600
- Why don't you sing it?
- I don't know if I know

1400
01:16:38,719 --> 01:16:40,440
all the words

1401
01:16:40,640 --> 01:16:43,640
Oh you probably do, try it.

1402
01:16:43,840 --> 01:16:45,820
Love is wonderful

1403
01:16:49,359 --> 01:16:54,399
the second time around

1404
01:16:57,600 --> 01:17:01,880
just as wonderful.

1405
01:17:03,439 --> 01:17:08,639
Put both feet on the ground,

1406
01:17:10,960 --> 01:17:14,360
it's the second time

1407
01:17:14,560 --> 01:17:17,159
you've heard

1408
01:17:17,359 --> 01:17:18,038
your

1409
01:17:18,238 --> 01:17:21,919
love song song.

1410
01:17:23,760 --> 01:17:26,519
It makes you think

1411
01:17:26,719 --> 01:17:30,760
perhaps that love like youth

1412
01:17:30,960 --> 01:17:33,879
is wasted

1413
01:17:34,079 --> 01:17:35,800
on the young.

1414
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:38,560
That's it.

1415
01:17:38,640 --> 01:17:42,920
Love's more comfortable

1416
01:17:44,319 --> 01:17:47,829
the second time you fall

1417
01:17:52,238 --> 01:17:57,238
like a friendly heart

1418
01:17:59,319 --> 01:18:03,829
the second time you call

1419
01:18:05,119 --> 01:18:05,720
who

1420
01:18:05,920 --> 01:18:08,920
knows

1421
01:18:10,479 --> 01:18:14,440
what let us to this miracle

1422
01:18:14,640 --> 01:18:18,119
we found

1423
01:18:19,679 --> 01:18:22,919
there are those

1424
01:18:23,119 --> 01:18:26,038
who bet

1425
01:18:26,238 --> 01:18:29,879
that love comes once

1426
01:18:30,079 --> 01:18:32,600
and yet

1427
01:18:32,800 --> 01:18:36,600
I'm so glad we met

1428
01:18:36,800 --> 01:18:44,800
the second time around...

1429
01:18:49,119 --> 01:18:51,998
- Sounds nice with the right words
- what do you mean?

1430
01:18:52,158 --> 01:18:54,000
- How long you been here?
- Here?

1431
01:18:54,200 --> 01:18:56,359
In this universe?

1432
01:18:57,600 --> 01:18:58,680
- You too?

1433
01:18:58,880 --> 01:19:01,500
Snapped a wishbone, Thanksgiving day, 1972.

1434
01:19:01,539 --> 01:19:03,860
Didn't you ever think about going back?

1435
01:19:03,960 --> 01:19:05,720
No I waited too long.

1436
01:19:05,920 --> 01:19:07,159
But listen,

1437
01:19:07,359 --> 01:19:09,100
if you're thinking about going back,

1438
01:19:09,200 --> 01:19:11,040
do it soon otherwise
it's going to be too late

1439
01:19:12,319 --> 01:19:13,958
Well you suppose that maybe if I go to

1440
01:19:14,158 --> 01:19:17,320
the same place at the same time...

1441
01:19:17,520 --> 01:19:21,080
It'll work in reverse.

1442
01:19:23,600 --> 01:19:25,879
Don't you want to keep it for yourself?

1443
01:19:26,079 --> 01:19:27,720
No, you know the song <i>White christmas</i>?

1444
01:19:27,920 --> 01:19:29,720
- Yeah.
- In this world, they think I wrote it

1445
01:19:29,760 --> 01:19:31,320
and I'm making a lot of bucks off of

1446
01:19:31,520 --> 01:19:32,520
that one.

1447
01:19:32,640 --> 01:19:34,607
Well thanks, maybe I'll
try it next Thanksgiving

1448
01:19:34,631 --> 01:19:37,840
Good luck.

1449
01:19:39,760 --> 01:19:41,560
Your keys, madam.

1450
01:19:41,760 --> 01:19:43,879
- Good night.
- Good night and have a happy

1451
01:19:44,079 --> 01:19:45,100
thanksgiving

1452
01:19:49,520 --> 01:19:51,480
what?

1453
01:19:54,479 --> 01:19:56,279
Hi, I'm back.

1454
01:19:56,479 --> 01:19:58,279
It's tomorrow Thanksgiving?

1455
01:19:58,479 --> 01:20:00,998
- I... Yes, second tuesday in december
- Great

1456
01:20:01,198 --> 01:20:02,760
Can you do me a favor?

1457
01:20:02,960 --> 01:20:05,958
- Pull.
- Okay.

1458
01:20:06,158 --> 01:20:08,439
- Did I get the big half?
- You did.

1459
01:20:08,639 --> 01:20:09,639
Great.

1460
01:20:09,679 --> 01:20:12,519
I'll see you around... I hope

1461
01:20:12,719 --> 01:20:14,519
Happy Thanksgiving.

1462
01:20:14,719 --> 01:20:17,239
She's really stressed in. Her mother's

1463
01:20:17,439 --> 01:20:21,678
going to Cuba.
- No that's right, come here.

1464
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:24,600
<i>Better late than never</i>
..final boarding call for flight C-100 to

1465
01:20:24,800 --> 01:20:26,038
Havana.

1466
01:20:26,238 --> 01:20:29,560
This is your final boarding call

1467
01:20:29,760 --> 01:20:32,839
for flight C-100 to Havana.

1468
01:20:33,039 --> 01:20:36,000
Mom, wait.

1469
01:20:36,800 --> 01:20:39,840
I was hoping you'd been...

1470
01:20:40,158 --> 01:20:41,720
I wasn't gonna let you go again without

1471
01:20:41,920 --> 01:20:44,519
saying goodbye.
- Again?

1472
01:20:44,719 --> 01:20:46,927
Mom I want you to
know that, no matter what,

1473
01:20:47,520 --> 01:20:50,600
you're always going to be in my heart.

1474
01:20:50,800 --> 01:20:52,360
It doesn't matter if I can't see you or

1475
01:20:52,560 --> 01:20:53,720
touch you.

1476
01:20:53,920 --> 01:20:55,720
It won't change anything, Okay?

1477
01:20:55,920 --> 01:20:57,440
Elizabeth what are you trying to say?

1478
01:20:57,600 --> 01:20:58,640
Can you just call me Beth,

1479
01:20:58,840 --> 01:21:02,390
just once please I can hear it.

1480
01:21:04,800 --> 01:21:05,800
Goodbye

1481
01:21:06,719 --> 01:21:08,719
Beth.

1482
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:17,980
Seetheart, I'm not gonna be so far away.

1483
01:21:18,238 --> 01:21:21,718
You never were.

1484
01:21:46,479 --> 01:21:47,800
Now, what?

1485
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:49,000
Two things

1486
01:21:49,198 --> 01:21:50,638
First, if I wake up tomorrow morning

1487
01:21:50,800 --> 01:21:52,279
I seem a little bit

1488
01:21:52,479 --> 01:21:54,199
more like my old self

1489
01:21:54,399 --> 01:21:56,439
- yeah?
- Tell me to stop acting like a brat

1490
01:21:56,639 --> 01:21:59,730
to call my mother. Here's her number.

1491
01:22:01,840 --> 01:22:03,400
Second, you need to get me to that bed

1492
01:22:03,600 --> 01:22:05,720
and breakfast before midnight
- Oh, what?

1493
01:22:05,920 --> 01:22:07,917
Nick, step on it.

1494
01:22:09,920 --> 01:22:11,917
All right, all right.

1495
01:22:26,719 --> 01:22:29,000
It's nice of you to do this, really.

1496
01:22:30,560 --> 01:22:32,600
Well, you tell me that the old Elizabeth

1497
01:22:32,800 --> 01:22:34,919
is coming back and I am there, but I do

1498
01:22:35,119 --> 01:22:37,079
not get this flea bag bed and breakfast.

1499
01:22:37,279 --> 01:22:39,079
Frankly I prefer the catamaran and the

1500
01:22:39,279 --> 01:22:40,439
thong bikini.

1501
01:22:40,639 --> 01:22:42,360
Well you know what, Nick, I'm sure that

1502
01:22:42,560 --> 01:22:44,055
somewhere in space and time there's an

1503
01:22:44,079 --> 01:22:45,720
Elizabeth who has the guts to wear a

1504
01:22:45,920 --> 01:22:47,958
thong and was just blown away by that whole

1505
01:22:48,158 --> 01:22:49,879
catamaran experience and wants to get

1506
01:22:50,079 --> 01:22:53,840
her back to you. This is how we can do it.

1507
01:23:00,960 --> 01:23:02,680
I'm really sorry for waking you up.

1508
01:23:02,880 --> 01:23:05,159
Upstairs, on your left, number seven.

1509
01:23:05,359 --> 01:23:06,359
Seven?

1510
01:23:06,479 --> 01:23:07,958
Oh no I can't have room seven I need

1511
01:23:08,158 --> 01:23:10,038
room nine. Last time we were in room 9!

1512
01:23:10,238 --> 01:23:11,438
I'm sorry it's not made up yet

1513
01:23:11,600 --> 01:23:13,640
No but there's a reason why
- what reason?

1514
01:23:13,840 --> 01:23:16,159
What reason?

1515
01:23:16,560 --> 01:23:17,720
What reason?

1516
01:23:17,920 --> 01:23:19,159
What is the reason?

1517
01:23:19,359 --> 01:23:21,720
- This is ridiculous.
- Okay Okay Okay.

1518
01:23:21,920 --> 01:23:23,958
This is the reason last time we were in

1519
01:23:24,158 --> 01:23:25,655
room nine and I came downstairs looking

1520
01:23:25,679 --> 01:23:27,239
for coffee, remember, do you remember?

1521
01:23:27,279 --> 01:23:28,695
And you said you don't serve coffee well

1522
01:23:28,719 --> 01:23:30,919
there is another couple in room nine who

1523
01:23:31,119 --> 01:23:33,940
do... does drink coffee
- you had two couples in room nine?

1524
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:36,079
- Different room 9
- there's only one room 9

1525
01:23:36,279 --> 01:23:37,279
That's what you think

1526
01:23:37,359 --> 01:23:38,879
Look make up your mind. I mean this is

1527
01:23:38,960 --> 01:23:40,919
totally ridiculous
- I know this sounds

1528
01:23:41,119 --> 01:23:43,239
mind-boggling but what I'm hoping is

1529
01:23:43,439 --> 01:23:44,856
that I can get back to them and they're

1530
01:23:44,880 --> 01:23:46,440
still there and only a minute or so has

1531
01:23:46,560 --> 01:23:48,038
passed in their time at least that's

1532
01:23:48,238 --> 01:23:49,879
what Albert Einstein thinks and

1533
01:23:50,079 --> 01:23:52,199
- That's your reason?
- That's mind-boggling

1534
01:23:52,399 --> 01:23:54,279
Yes, that's my reason.

1535
01:23:54,479 --> 01:23:55,958
All right look hold on look

1536
01:23:56,158 --> 01:23:58,600
the other reason is

1537
01:23:58,800 --> 01:24:00,038
she's hot to trot♪♪♪

1538
01:24:00,238 --> 01:24:02,839
Nixon says "go for it".

1539
01:24:14,479 --> 01:24:17,839
There you are, Elizabeth.

1540
01:24:18,719 --> 01:24:20,600
Knock yourself out.

1541
01:24:22,399 --> 01:24:23,879
Yeah, it's the frumpy girl that wears

1542
01:24:23,920 --> 01:24:25,720
baggy pajamas to bed. You must be from

1543
01:24:25,920 --> 01:24:27,159
another world.

1544
01:24:27,359 --> 01:24:28,640
Nick stop it.

1545
01:24:28,840 --> 01:24:33,560
_ Ouh what's your name?
- Beth. My name is Beth.

1546
01:24:33,760 --> 01:24:35,015
You know, not too aggressive, it's a

1547
01:24:35,039 --> 01:24:37,079
little weird.
- Okay I'm sorry all right

1548
01:24:37,279 --> 01:24:38,695
I didn't mean to yell. I'm just under a lot

1549
01:24:38,719 --> 01:24:39,800
of pressure.

1550
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:42,919
I've got a lot of stuff on my mind. Okay

1551
01:24:43,119 --> 01:24:44,919
No more wishbones,

1552
01:24:45,119 --> 01:24:47,000
back to tuna noodle casserole.

1553
01:24:47,039 --> 01:24:48,998
Okay get in bed.

1554
01:24:49,198 --> 01:24:50,199
Then what?

1555
01:24:50,399 --> 01:24:53,079
- And then you go to sleep
- and then what?

1556
01:24:53,279 --> 01:24:54,856
And then, I go to sleep, and then I wake up

1557
01:24:54,880 --> 01:24:56,239
and you're somebody else.

1558
01:24:57,439 --> 01:24:58,439
No offense.

1559
01:24:58,560 --> 01:25:00,998
I got to be somebody else no no no no no

1560
01:25:01,198 --> 01:25:03,079
no no listen to me right now there are

1561
01:25:03,279 --> 01:25:04,799
about a million women in the federated

1562
01:25:04,960 --> 01:25:06,680
states of america that are fantasizing

1563
01:25:06,880 --> 01:25:08,680
about Nick Fowler, no no, you want to be

1564
01:25:08,880 --> 01:25:10,214
somebody else, hey that's cool, cause

1565
01:25:10,238 --> 01:25:11,638
frankly, the way you've been acting

1566
01:25:11,679 --> 01:25:13,879
lately, I wish you were somebody else.

1567
01:25:14,079 --> 01:25:17,279
No but me, I am Nick Fowler.

1568
01:25:17,379 --> 01:25:19,800
My point exactly.

1569
01:25:21,920 --> 01:25:23,255
Yeah well you know as long as we get

1570
01:25:23,279 --> 01:25:24,279
that straight.

1571
01:25:24,479 --> 01:25:26,839
Oh please let this work.

1572
01:25:33,840 --> 01:25:36,440
Come on, come on, come on, come on...

1573
01:25:41,840 --> 01:25:47,440
Sometimes things don't work out
the same way twice.

1574
01:25:47,840 --> 01:25:50,440
But sometimes they do.

1575
01:26:26,079 --> 01:26:29,400
I'm gonna put on a nice clean dress

1576
01:26:29,600 --> 01:26:32,839
and a big fat smile

1577
01:26:33,039 --> 01:26:36,920
and start a new day.

1578
01:26:43,840 --> 01:26:46,440
Meanwhile... in another life.

1579
01:27:00,319 --> 01:27:01,320
Nick!

1580
01:27:01,520 --> 01:27:02,680
Elizabeth.

1581
01:27:02,880 --> 01:27:05,079
Oh, thank God!

1582
01:27:05,279 --> 01:27:07,159
I had this horrible dream... I was in...

1583
01:27:07,359 --> 01:27:08,839
I was in some other universe.

1584
01:27:09,039 --> 01:27:10,295
Well you know, come
on, these games are just

1585
01:27:10,319 --> 01:27:12,038
getting in the way
- No, listen there

1586
01:27:12,238 --> 01:27:13,800
was this guy sleeping next to me and

1587
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:15,255
I couldn't wake him up and then I went

1588
01:27:15,279 --> 01:27:16,615
through his wallet and he didn't have

1589
01:27:16,639 --> 01:27:18,455
any money. He didn't
even have any credit cards.

1590
01:27:18,479 --> 01:27:20,519
No platinum card, and our car it was gone

1591
01:27:20,719 --> 01:27:22,919
and some hunk of junk was in its

1592
01:27:23,119 --> 01:27:24,459
place.

1593
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:33,000
Beth?

1594
01:27:35,699 --> 01:27:38,500
S'il vous plaît, Madame, il y a
des gens qui dorment à cette heure-ci!

1595
01:27:39,119 --> 01:27:40,439
You're French

1596
01:27:40,639 --> 01:27:42,729
you're French again!

1597
01:27:42,799 --> 01:27:44,639
Ecoutez, Madame, c'est vraiment
pas tolérable!

1598
01:27:44,799 --> 01:27:46,719
Vous êtes français, je
suis tellement contente!

1599
01:27:47,799 --> 01:27:49,500
C'est incroyable!

1600
01:27:50,479 --> 01:27:52,400
I'll handle this!

1601
01:27:52,479 --> 01:27:53,976
Hey, how come you didn't tell me you got

1602
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:55,519
a research grant?

1603
01:27:56,719 --> 01:27:58,399
I think I applied for one but I haven't...

1604
01:27:58,560 --> 01:28:00,279
No, you got it, I have a letter.

1605
01:28:00,479 --> 01:28:01,720
You got a letter?

1606
01:28:01,920 --> 01:28:04,119
No, I had a letter. You had a letter?

1607
01:28:04,319 --> 01:28:05,576
Hang on, I'll come up
and explain everything.

1608
01:28:05,600 --> 01:28:06,919
OK

1609
01:28:07,119 --> 01:28:09,919
It came in the mail. I
got it out of the mailbox.

1610
01:28:12,238 --> 01:28:13,879
Nicky, I just want to make sure the car

1611
01:28:14,079 --> 01:28:15,759
is there. I don't want to mess around with

1612
01:28:15,920 --> 01:28:17,560
alternative universe cars.

1613
01:28:17,760 --> 01:28:19,320
I mean you know, breakfast something.

1614
01:28:20,238 --> 01:28:22,119
Wait wait, you do have the letter or

1615
01:28:22,319 --> 01:28:24,134
you don't have the letter? I'm confused.
- No I had it I had it but

1616
01:28:24,158 --> 01:28:25,816
believe me, you got it, you got it.
- I got the grant.

1617
01:28:25,840 --> 01:28:27,640
And you just... you got the grant and

1618
01:28:27,840 --> 01:28:29,320
you deserve it and you deserve

1619
01:28:29,520 --> 01:28:31,239
everything great, believe me, I have a lot

1620
01:28:31,439 --> 01:28:32,936
invested in you, buddy, and I plan to see

1621
01:28:32,960 --> 01:28:34,680
it pay off.
- The car's still here what are

1622
01:28:34,880 --> 01:28:36,360
you talking about?
- What?

1623
01:28:36,560 --> 01:28:38,200
No, I did not tell Nick's sister that she

1624
01:28:38,238 --> 01:28:40,119
could be on TV.

1625
01:28:40,319 --> 01:28:42,360
Oh she is?

1626
01:28:42,560 --> 01:28:44,839
Oh yeah, I thought she was pretty good.

1627
01:28:45,039 --> 01:28:46,039
Yeah that's why I...

1628
01:28:46,238 --> 01:28:47,238
you know...

1629
01:28:47,279 --> 01:28:51,119
told her...
- There's nothing wrong with the car.

1630
01:28:53,600 --> 01:28:54,600
Honey,

1631
01:28:54,639 --> 01:28:56,159
if I take this grant I'm gonna have to

1632
01:28:56,238 --> 01:28:57,655
move to like the farthest
corner of New Guinea.

1633
01:28:57,679 --> 01:29:00,038
I love New Guinea.

1634
01:29:00,238 --> 01:29:01,560
I can't ask you to quit your job

1635
01:29:01,760 --> 01:29:03,640
Oh forget about the job, I already quit.

1636
01:29:03,840 --> 01:29:05,320
I want to do my own show I want to do

1637
01:29:05,520 --> 01:29:07,479
a show about real people, something I can

1638
01:29:07,679 --> 01:29:09,255
really care about. Listen, I have tons of

1639
01:29:09,279 --> 01:29:10,479
ideas and I want your input on

1640
01:29:10,639 --> 01:29:12,319
everything.
- Wait wait wait back it up you

1641
01:29:12,479 --> 01:29:14,399
want my input on?
- Shut up and kiss me.

1642
01:29:18,479 --> 01:29:19,599
I love it when you say that.

1643
01:29:19,815 --> 01:29:22,319
Oh, I knew you would.

1644
01:29:24,238 --> 01:29:26,470
Come here.

1645
01:30:22,479 --> 01:30:24,079
You
