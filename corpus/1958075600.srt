1
00:00:12,053 --> 00:00:14,014
(upbeat music continues)

2
00:00:14,055 --> 00:00:15,932
- [Liv] There's a reason
they call Christmas

3
00:00:15,974 --> 00:00:18,101
the most wonderful
time of the year.

4
00:00:21,062 --> 00:00:23,273
It's a time of
reflection and tradition

5
00:00:23,314 --> 00:00:25,900
that brings out
the best in people.

6
00:00:25,942 --> 00:00:27,444
Well, usually.

7
00:00:28,737 --> 00:00:32,657
There's the 85 foot Christmas
tree in Union Square.

8
00:00:32,699 --> 00:00:36,369
It's the centerpiece of San
Francisco during the holidays.

9
00:00:37,454 --> 00:00:40,665
And the Fairmont Hotel with
its life size gingerbread house

10
00:00:40,707 --> 00:00:42,208
in the lobby.

11
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:45,670
It invites people to enjoy
what I love about Christmas,

12
00:00:45,712 --> 00:00:48,757
wonder, warmth, and elegance.

13
00:00:48,798 --> 00:00:51,426
(upbeat music)

14
00:01:01,227 --> 00:01:03,563
And then there's my parents.

15
00:01:03,605 --> 00:01:08,401
To them, Christmas is one
big, loud, overblown carnival.

16
00:01:08,443 --> 00:01:11,154
(upbeat music)

17
00:01:19,954 --> 00:01:21,748
Mom, dad.

18
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:22,749
- Hi honey.

19
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:26,336
- You guys really need to
start giving things away.

20
00:01:26,378 --> 00:01:28,505
You've become
Christmas hoarders.

21
00:01:28,546 --> 00:01:30,548
- Why would we give things
away, we're still using them.

22
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:33,259
- Well, maybe you need to stop
buying new things every year.

23
00:01:33,301 --> 00:01:35,178
This place is a fire hazard.

24
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:38,014
- Oh, speaking of fire hazards.

25
00:01:38,056 --> 00:01:41,142
(whimsical music)

26
00:01:43,061 --> 00:01:45,063
- You've really
outdone yourself.

27
00:01:45,105 --> 00:01:46,272
- Isn't it great?

28
00:01:46,314 --> 00:01:47,982
- You know when people
think Christmas,

29
00:01:48,024 --> 00:01:49,984
they don't usually
think, dragon.

30
00:01:50,026 --> 00:01:51,611
- What would you rather
pull in your sleigh,

31
00:01:51,653 --> 00:01:55,490
a reindeer with a glowing nose
or a fire breathing dragon?

32
00:01:57,992 --> 00:02:00,078
Perfection.

33
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:00,954
- Hi, dad.

34
00:02:00,995 --> 00:02:02,956
Ooh, hard at work?

35
00:02:02,997 --> 00:02:05,000
- I'm still trying to
figure out my signature dish

36
00:02:05,041 --> 00:02:05,959
for the party.

37
00:02:06,001 --> 00:02:07,252
I've never been this far behind.

38
00:02:07,293 --> 00:02:09,129
Braised abalone
and cranberry sauce

39
00:02:09,170 --> 00:02:11,631
didn't go as well as I hoped.

40
00:02:11,673 --> 00:02:14,968
- Dad, I know you and mom
like to go a little extra

41
00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:15,969
for Christmas,

42
00:02:16,011 --> 00:02:17,303
but maybe one of these years

43
00:02:17,345 --> 00:02:19,597
you could try scaling
it back just a little.

44
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:23,435
Make it more intimate and
less crazy, loud Asians.

45
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:26,771
Plenty of people
have lovely, low key,

46
00:02:26,813 --> 00:02:28,898
totally normal Christmas
parties every year.

47
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:32,027
- Let other people have boring,
normal Christmas parties.

48
00:02:32,068 --> 00:02:34,320
This is the Changtastic
Christmas party.

49
00:02:34,362 --> 00:02:38,241
- Exactly, it's the
Changtastic Christmas party.

50
00:02:38,283 --> 00:02:40,869
I can't remember the last
time we celebrated as a family

51
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:42,412
without the entire neighborhood.

52
00:02:42,454 --> 00:02:44,998
- You should be proud that
so many who wanna spend time

53
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:46,499
with us.

54
00:02:46,541 --> 00:02:48,251
I mean, is it our fault that
more show up every year?

55
00:02:48,293 --> 00:02:49,669
- That's what makes
it so special.

56
00:02:49,711 --> 00:02:52,005
Though, it does make
my signature dish

57
00:02:52,047 --> 00:02:53,840
a bigger challenge each year.

58
00:02:53,882 --> 00:02:55,300
- I believe in you, honey.

59
00:02:55,342 --> 00:02:58,511
You go into that kitchen
and you make me proud.

60
00:02:58,553 --> 00:03:00,221
- You're right, if
you'll excuse me,

61
00:03:00,263 --> 00:03:02,474
I have a recipe for
nutmeg mapo tofu

62
00:03:02,515 --> 00:03:03,892
I've been meaning to try.

63
00:03:06,394 --> 00:03:09,856
- So, you bringing anybody
to the party this year?

64
00:03:09,898 --> 00:03:15,403
- Flying solo as usual, 'tis
the season to be independent.

65
00:03:15,987 --> 00:03:17,405
- That doesn't even make sense,

66
00:03:17,447 --> 00:03:18,573
this is the season for love.

67
00:03:18,615 --> 00:03:20,700
- I thought that
was Valentine's Day.

68
00:03:20,742 --> 00:03:23,495
- It's love, it can
only have one season?

69
00:03:23,536 --> 00:03:27,248
You haven't invited anyone
in years, not even a friend.

70
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:29,542
This is the 25th
anniversary of our party.

71
00:03:29,584 --> 00:03:32,420
- Can we not talk about
this right now? Please.

72
00:03:32,462 --> 00:03:35,423
- Fine, I'll stop as
long as you promise

73
00:03:35,465 --> 00:03:37,050
to help me prepare
these decorations.

74
00:03:37,092 --> 00:03:40,553
You know, we only have two
weeks before Christmas Eve,

75
00:03:40,595 --> 00:03:41,888
so pick a pile.

76
00:03:44,015 --> 00:03:44,891
- Okay,

77
00:03:44,933 --> 00:03:47,185
(upbeat music)

78
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:50,146
* A Christmas city is
big and beautiful *

79
00:03:50,188 --> 00:03:51,398
* Bright lights everywhere. *

80
00:03:51,439 --> 00:03:52,816
Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

81
00:03:52,857 --> 00:03:55,402
* A place where you
can meet St. Nick *

82
00:03:55,443 --> 00:03:58,238
* So join our journey there *

83
00:03:58,279 --> 00:04:01,241
* A Christmas city
is a magical site. *

84
00:04:01,282 --> 00:04:03,868
* No other place compares *

85
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:06,913
* The smell of pine trees
and crackling fires *

86
00:04:06,955 --> 00:04:09,833
* Christmas is in the air *

87
00:04:09,874 --> 00:04:12,419
* Gifts for all, the
reindeer's racing *

88
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:15,463
* Snowmen come to life. *

89
00:04:15,505 --> 00:04:20,677
* Christmas trees that
are twice the size *

90
00:04:21,845 --> 00:04:23,555
- Hi, good morning.

91
00:04:40,739 --> 00:04:43,408
(gentle music)

92
00:04:50,081 --> 00:04:53,668
(gentle music continues)

93
00:05:00,216 --> 00:05:03,720
(gentle music continues)

94
00:05:09,934 --> 00:05:12,604
(gentle music continues)

95
00:05:12,645 --> 00:05:14,189
- You know,

96
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:16,149
most people would think it's
creepy to discover a stranger

97
00:05:16,191 --> 00:05:17,400
taking photos of them.

98
00:05:17,442 --> 00:05:19,486
- Sorry, it's kind
of a reflex for me

99
00:05:19,527 --> 00:05:21,154
when I see a beautiful shot.

100
00:05:21,196 --> 00:05:22,697
- Oh, you think I'm beautiful?

101
00:05:22,739 --> 00:05:26,910
- No, no, well, no, I mean
the composition, this scenery,

102
00:05:26,951 --> 00:05:27,869
it's...

103
00:05:29,537 --> 00:05:31,539
I'm trying to think of an
adjective that isn't weird.

104
00:05:31,581 --> 00:05:33,541
- I'm kidding, I
know what you meant.

105
00:05:33,583 --> 00:05:36,670
- Well, thank you for letting
me die of embarrassment.

106
00:05:37,545 --> 00:05:40,965
- May I see it, this
beautiful photo of me?

107
00:05:41,007 --> 00:05:41,883
- Sure.

108
00:05:45,011 --> 00:05:46,429
- Wow, you're right.

109
00:05:47,097 --> 00:05:48,515
I look really good here.

110
00:05:49,391 --> 00:05:50,892
- Okay, you've had your fun.

111
00:05:50,934 --> 00:05:53,561
- Seriously though,
it's a good picture.

112
00:05:54,396 --> 00:05:56,064
Could you text it to me?

113
00:05:57,148 --> 00:06:00,402
- Is this your clever way of
trying to get my phone number?

114
00:06:01,486 --> 00:06:03,321
- I'd like to think I could
be more clever than that,

115
00:06:03,363 --> 00:06:04,698
and I don't think
it's too much to ask

116
00:06:04,739 --> 00:06:07,492
seeing as how I am the
person in the photo.

117
00:06:08,827 --> 00:06:09,744
- Good point.

118
00:06:10,578 --> 00:06:12,080
Go ahead, text away.

119
00:06:14,082 --> 00:06:15,542
So are you meeting someone?

120
00:06:15,583 --> 00:06:19,629
- Yeah, just admiring the
photographs while I waited.

121
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:21,464
- Thank you.

122
00:06:22,465 --> 00:06:23,591
- That's yours too?

123
00:06:23,633 --> 00:06:25,969
- It is, I'm a
photographer here.

124
00:06:26,011 --> 00:06:26,886
- Hmm.

125
00:06:26,928 --> 00:06:28,680
- Ah, there he is.

126
00:06:28,722 --> 00:06:31,391
Charles Wells, editor in chief,
you must be the new writer.

127
00:06:31,433 --> 00:06:32,976
- Henry, excited to be here.

128
00:06:33,018 --> 00:06:35,854
- Glad to see you starting to
get to know your colleagues.

129
00:06:35,895 --> 00:06:36,521
Morning, Liv.

130
00:06:36,563 --> 00:06:37,772
- Morning, Charles.

131
00:06:37,814 --> 00:06:39,357
- Henry's joining us
from The Bangkok Post,

132
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:42,027
he's one of their
top feature writers.

133
00:06:42,068 --> 00:06:43,778
Shall we Chat?
- Lead the Way.

134
00:06:44,779 --> 00:06:50,035
Liv, it was interesting
meeting you.

135
00:06:51,453 --> 00:06:52,662
- You as well.

136
00:06:55,123 --> 00:06:58,835
We'll have an anxiety spiral
about it later tonight.

137
00:06:58,877 --> 00:07:02,005
(upbeat music)

138
00:07:02,047 --> 00:07:02,964
- Have a seat.

139
00:07:04,632 --> 00:07:07,427
Oh, I know this is a lot to
take in on your first day,

140
00:07:07,469 --> 00:07:09,304
and I promise I'm not
trying to scare you off,

141
00:07:09,346 --> 00:07:11,014
but we do move pretty
quickly around here.

142
00:07:11,056 --> 00:07:13,224
- Believe me, things were
no different at The Post.

143
00:07:13,266 --> 00:07:14,642
I'm happy to hit
the ground running.

144
00:07:14,684 --> 00:07:16,770
- I'm very glad to
hear you say that

145
00:07:16,811 --> 00:07:19,105
because you'll soon find
that the Christmas edition

146
00:07:19,147 --> 00:07:21,900
here at The Chronicle is one
of the biggest of the year.

147
00:07:21,941 --> 00:07:24,277
We're always on the lookout
for a new story to tell,

148
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:26,905
and I think this being your
first Christmas in America,

149
00:07:26,946 --> 00:07:28,907
that you'll have a
very fresh perspective.

150
00:07:28,948 --> 00:07:30,742
Now, I'm meeting with the
writers tomorrow to go over

151
00:07:30,784 --> 00:07:32,702
our current Christmas articles,

152
00:07:33,578 --> 00:07:35,163
love to have some
ideas from you.

153
00:07:35,997 --> 00:07:37,415
- Definitely,

154
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:38,958
I'll get started putting
those together immediately.

155
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,503
- Excellent, looking
forward to it.

156
00:07:41,544 --> 00:07:44,297
And welcome to The
Chronicle, Henry.

157
00:07:44,339 --> 00:07:45,799
- Great to be here.

158
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:48,510
(upbeat music)

159
00:07:56,267 --> 00:07:57,811
(upbeat music continues)

160
00:07:57,852 --> 00:07:58,978
(camera clicks)

161
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:00,438
- Where have you been?

162
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,607
- Relax, I'm like
10 minutes late,

163
00:08:02,649 --> 00:08:03,858
that's pretty good for me.

164
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:05,402
- You'd think with all
the money you're saving,

165
00:08:05,443 --> 00:08:07,737
living at mom and dad's, you
could afford some real clothes.

166
00:08:07,779 --> 00:08:10,115
- Hey, hey, this style, okay.

167
00:08:10,156 --> 00:08:12,075
And with all the money
I'm saving on rent,

168
00:08:12,117 --> 00:08:13,910
I'll be able to afford
my own place in the city

169
00:08:13,952 --> 00:08:15,078
by the time I'm 45.

170
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,371
You sure you don't
wanna move back in?

171
00:08:16,413 --> 00:08:17,872
- Oh, as much as I love you all,

172
00:08:17,914 --> 00:08:20,208
I'd much rather
preserve my sanity.

173
00:08:28,049 --> 00:08:29,676
You know that guy?

174
00:08:29,718 --> 00:08:32,721
- Yeah, he just started
at The Chronicle today,

175
00:08:32,762 --> 00:08:34,764
Henry something. I don't know.

176
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:36,766
- Yo, Henry.

177
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:40,645
- Oh, hey, Liv.

178
00:08:42,313 --> 00:08:44,733
And?
- Andrew, my brother.

179
00:08:44,774 --> 00:08:45,692
- Hi.

180
00:08:50,447 --> 00:08:52,782
- You need some help?
You look kind of lost.

181
00:08:52,824 --> 00:08:55,035
- Yeah, actually I'm
looking for this restaurant,

182
00:08:55,076 --> 00:08:55,869
Mai Pen Rai.

183
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:56,870
- Well that place is great.

184
00:08:56,911 --> 00:08:58,038
They got this coconut pudding,

185
00:08:58,079 --> 00:08:59,873
they literally make
it at the table.

186
00:08:59,914 --> 00:09:01,207
You should ask for
my friend Ricky,

187
00:09:01,249 --> 00:09:02,459
he'll hook you up.

188
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:03,918
- Thanks, I'm actually
going there for a story.

189
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:06,004
Charles wants more ideas
for the Christmas edition

190
00:09:06,046 --> 00:09:07,505
of the paper.

191
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:09,090
I hear this restaurant's
created this interesting menu

192
00:09:09,132 --> 00:09:10,592
for the holidays,

193
00:09:10,633 --> 00:09:12,093
blending traditional Thai
dishes with Christmas flavors.

194
00:09:12,135 --> 00:09:15,180
- If you are looking for
Christmas story, we got you...

195
00:09:15,221 --> 00:09:16,139
What's that for?

196
00:09:16,181 --> 00:09:17,432
- Andrew, why did you tell Henry

197
00:09:17,474 --> 00:09:19,059
how to get to the restaurant?

198
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:21,644
- Fine, if you'll
stop hitting me.

199
00:09:23,938 --> 00:09:25,065
Around the corner
is a laundromat,

200
00:09:25,106 --> 00:09:26,733
next to the front
door is a staircase,

201
00:09:26,775 --> 00:09:28,985
go up and you are in the
entrance of an art gallery.

202
00:09:29,027 --> 00:09:31,821
Head inside and in the
back next to an exhibit,

203
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:33,656
is Mai Pen Rai.

204
00:09:34,491 --> 00:09:37,619
If there are any
problems, just text me.

205
00:09:39,871 --> 00:09:42,916
- You are the most helpful
person I've met here so far.

206
00:09:42,957 --> 00:09:45,251
- You really are new
here, aren't you?

207
00:09:46,294 --> 00:09:48,046
- I better get going,
story meeting's tomorrow,

208
00:09:48,088 --> 00:09:49,714
and I've got a lot
of ground to cover.

209
00:09:49,756 --> 00:09:51,675
- Well, good luck and
feel free to bring us back

210
00:09:51,716 --> 00:09:53,093
some spring rolls.

211
00:09:56,846 --> 00:09:58,181
- Ow.

212
00:09:58,223 --> 00:09:59,307
You're gonna tell me what
I did to deserve that?

213
00:09:59,349 --> 00:10:00,934
You know I bruise like a peach.

214
00:10:00,975 --> 00:10:04,312
- You almost mentioned
mom and dad's party.

215
00:10:04,354 --> 00:10:05,855
- Right.

216
00:10:05,897 --> 00:10:08,733
Do people at work still not
know how Changtastic you are?

217
00:10:08,775 --> 00:10:10,819
- I just don't wanna
be associated with this

218
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:12,654
over the top extravaganza.

219
00:10:12,696 --> 00:10:14,280
I'm trying to make
a name for myself.

220
00:10:14,322 --> 00:10:16,449
- Oh, so now Chang is
not a good enough name?

221
00:10:16,491 --> 00:10:20,453
- They're like a
bajillion Changs, I
wanna be my own person.

222
00:10:20,495 --> 00:10:21,663
- And do you know who that is?

223
00:10:21,705 --> 00:10:24,499
- Yes, Liv Rose,
celebrated photographer,

224
00:10:24,541 --> 00:10:26,292
and all around icon.

225
00:10:26,334 --> 00:10:27,877
- I'm not calling you that.

226
00:10:28,753 --> 00:10:30,672
- Come on, lunch is on me.

227
00:10:31,589 --> 00:10:33,466
- Okay, Liv Chang.

228
00:10:33,508 --> 00:10:36,177
(upbeat music)

229
00:10:44,144 --> 00:10:47,814
- [Ivy] Liv.

230
00:10:47,856 --> 00:10:50,316
- Mom, I just went
grocery shopping.

231
00:10:50,358 --> 00:10:51,484
- Just a few small items.

232
00:10:51,526 --> 00:10:53,194
- Oh, sure it is.

233
00:10:53,236 --> 00:10:55,280
And you know, maybe a
text before you stop
by would be nice.

234
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:57,949
- I'm sorry, I thought you
carrying for nine months

235
00:10:57,991 --> 00:10:59,784
and then raising you
for the next 18 years

236
00:10:59,826 --> 00:11:02,162
would entitle me to
an occasional visit.

237
00:11:05,707 --> 00:11:07,334
- Seriously?

238
00:11:07,375 --> 00:11:08,793
- Don't look at me.

239
00:11:08,835 --> 00:11:09,711
Last thing I wanted to do
tonight is carry a tree

240
00:11:09,753 --> 00:11:11,212
up three flights of stairs.

241
00:11:13,298 --> 00:11:15,425
- What, you didn't have a
Christmas tree, you're welcome.

242
00:11:15,467 --> 00:11:18,386
- Mom, I know you mean well,
but this is all too much.

243
00:11:18,428 --> 00:11:21,514
- Okay, fine, fine, I will
return whatever you don't want.

244
00:11:21,556 --> 00:11:22,682
But the Christmas tree stays.

245
00:11:22,724 --> 00:11:25,185
- Aww, you have no ornaments?

246
00:11:25,226 --> 00:11:28,772
- No, no, okay, no ornaments,
this circus is over.

247
00:11:28,813 --> 00:11:31,608
- But I got that boring,
generic kind like you like.

248
00:11:31,649 --> 00:11:33,401
- I gotta go anyways,
I promised Henry

249
00:11:33,443 --> 00:11:34,402
I'd meet him for dinner.

250
00:11:34,444 --> 00:11:35,570
- What? Why?

251
00:11:35,612 --> 00:11:36,529
- Who is Henry?

252
00:11:36,571 --> 00:11:38,531
- He's a new coworker.

253
00:11:38,573 --> 00:11:40,617
Why are you meeting
Henry for dinner?

254
00:11:40,658 --> 00:11:42,410
- He seems cool, plus
he's new in town,

255
00:11:42,452 --> 00:11:43,620
and doesn't have any friends.

256
00:11:43,661 --> 00:11:45,705
It's called being nice,
you should try it.

257
00:11:45,747 --> 00:11:47,457
- Oh, you're such a good boy.

258
00:11:47,499 --> 00:11:50,627
- Well, I trust you won't
mention anything you shouldn't.

259
00:11:50,669 --> 00:11:52,587
- Yeah, yeah, don't worry.

260
00:11:52,629 --> 00:11:53,755
Bye Mom.

261
00:11:58,093 --> 00:11:59,177
- What?

262
00:11:59,219 --> 00:12:00,595
- So this Henry,
tell me about him.

263
00:12:00,637 --> 00:12:01,805
- Mom, just because a man exists

264
00:12:01,846 --> 00:12:03,223
does not mean I
have to date him.

265
00:12:03,264 --> 00:12:06,226
- Tell that to my
non-existent grandchildren.

266
00:12:07,686 --> 00:12:09,229
Fine, we'll just
decorate your tree.

267
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:13,274
- Okay, but we're
using my decorations.

268
00:12:14,275 --> 00:12:15,151
- Hmm.

269
00:12:21,866 --> 00:12:23,952
- Okay, I think we
have enough gold.

270
00:12:26,621 --> 00:12:28,081
Where are the rest
of your ornaments?

271
00:12:28,123 --> 00:12:29,332
- Oh, that's it.

272
00:12:30,208 --> 00:12:32,085
What, don't you think
it looks beautiful?

273
00:12:32,127 --> 00:12:34,838
- I feel like I'm
in a fancy forest.

274
00:12:34,879 --> 00:12:37,340
You know, you used to like
all the fun decorations

275
00:12:37,382 --> 00:12:38,216
we had at home.

276
00:12:38,258 --> 00:12:39,426
- Well, what can I say?

277
00:12:39,467 --> 00:12:42,178
People change, tastes evolve.

278
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:43,304
I'm a grownup now.

279
00:12:44,806 --> 00:12:48,977
- See, now this frame, this
is what I'm talking about.

280
00:12:49,019 --> 00:12:52,897
It has color, it
has joy, I love it.

281
00:12:52,939 --> 00:12:54,816
- That's because you bought it.

282
00:12:56,317 --> 00:12:58,820
Come on, time for
the final touch.

283
00:12:58,862 --> 00:12:59,988
- [Ivy] All right.

284
00:13:00,822 --> 00:13:03,575
(upbeat music)

285
00:13:14,669 --> 00:13:17,339
- So, what do we think?

286
00:13:18,465 --> 00:13:19,799
- Fine.

287
00:13:19,841 --> 00:13:20,925
It's pretty.

288
00:13:22,302 --> 00:13:24,387
And if this pretty boring
tree makes you happy,

289
00:13:24,429 --> 00:13:25,805
then who am I to judge?

290
00:13:25,847 --> 00:13:28,558
(upbeat music)

291
00:13:36,816 --> 00:13:38,360
- [Charles] Liv, get in here.

292
00:13:41,154 --> 00:13:42,947
- Hi Charles, do you need me?

293
00:13:42,989 --> 00:13:45,575
- Yes, Henry pitched this
fantastic idea to me,

294
00:13:45,617 --> 00:13:46,659
and you sprang to mind.

295
00:13:46,701 --> 00:13:47,952
Please sit.

296
00:13:47,994 --> 00:13:49,454
Come on, Henry, fill her in.

297
00:13:49,496 --> 00:13:50,372
- Sure.

298
00:13:50,413 --> 00:13:51,790
I was just telling Charles

299
00:13:51,831 --> 00:13:53,958
about this Chinese Christmas
party I heard about.

300
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,835
Apparently it's huge.

301
00:13:55,877 --> 00:13:58,296
- Oh, is this a local party?

302
00:13:58,338 --> 00:13:59,589
- Yeah, up in Knob Hill.

303
00:14:00,715 --> 00:14:02,008
- And you mentioned
you thought of me

304
00:14:02,050 --> 00:14:03,510
when Henry pitched this?

305
00:14:03,551 --> 00:14:05,887
- I've seen your Christmas
in San Francisco series.

306
00:14:05,929 --> 00:14:07,514
That's great stuff.

307
00:14:07,555 --> 00:14:08,973
- Oh, thank you, yeah.

308
00:14:09,015 --> 00:14:10,225
- Besides, don't you
live nearby there?

309
00:14:10,266 --> 00:14:11,810
I mean, you must have
seen it over the years,

310
00:14:11,851 --> 00:14:12,852
it's a big party.

311
00:14:12,894 --> 00:14:14,354
- Yes, I have seen it.

312
00:14:14,396 --> 00:14:17,399
I'm not sure it's the
right assignment for us.

313
00:14:19,984 --> 00:14:22,737
I mean, I just think
we can go bigger

314
00:14:22,779 --> 00:14:25,323
than a neighborhood
Christmas party. Right?

315
00:14:25,365 --> 00:14:28,118
- I don't know, the way the
Changs described it to me,

316
00:14:28,159 --> 00:14:30,870
it seems like it has
a pretty big impact.

317
00:14:30,912 --> 00:14:31,996
- You met them?

318
00:14:32,789 --> 00:14:34,207
What, what did they say?

319
00:14:34,249 --> 00:14:37,168
- They loved the idea and
they seemed really nice.

320
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:38,920
I didn't have a chance
to chat to them further,

321
00:14:38,962 --> 00:14:40,714
I wanted to make sure they
were okay with the story

322
00:14:40,755 --> 00:14:42,382
before I pitched it to Charles.

323
00:14:42,424 --> 00:14:44,634
- You know Liv, if you don't
wanna do this piece with Henry,

324
00:14:44,676 --> 00:14:46,136
that's fine,

325
00:14:46,177 --> 00:14:49,389
I just thought it was time
to give you a cover story.

326
00:14:49,431 --> 00:14:51,850
- Wait, you wanna make
this a cover story?

327
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:53,893
- Well, I'm considering it.

328
00:14:53,935 --> 00:14:55,061
It'd be great for your career,

329
00:14:55,103 --> 00:14:57,272
not to mention a huge
splash for Henry,

330
00:14:57,313 --> 00:15:00,025
his first article here
on the front page.

331
00:15:00,066 --> 00:15:02,402
But I can always assign
it to someone else.

332
00:15:03,278 --> 00:15:04,738
I just thought
you'd be interested

333
00:15:04,779 --> 00:15:08,450
since you seem to have an
eye for that Christmas magic.

334
00:15:12,162 --> 00:15:14,039
- Well, how could I say no?

335
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:15,915
- Looks like we're
all gonna be having

336
00:15:15,957 --> 00:15:17,959
a Changtastic Christmas.

337
00:15:18,001 --> 00:15:21,087
(everyone laughs)

338
00:15:25,842 --> 00:15:28,470
(phone rings)

339
00:15:29,846 --> 00:15:30,764
- Hello.

340
00:15:30,805 --> 00:15:32,390
- [Liv] Good morning, traitor.

341
00:15:32,432 --> 00:15:33,933
- What?

342
00:15:33,975 --> 00:15:35,393
- Did you have fun at your
dinner with Henry last night?

343
00:15:35,435 --> 00:15:38,563
Mention any family secrets
you were explicitly told

344
00:15:38,605 --> 00:15:39,773
not to discuss?

345
00:15:39,814 --> 00:15:41,691
- No, you barely even came up.

346
00:15:41,733 --> 00:15:43,943
- Then how come
Henry pitched my boss

347
00:15:43,985 --> 00:15:45,278
a story about our party?

348
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:47,447
- I don't know,
he's a journalist,

349
00:15:47,489 --> 00:15:49,032
isn't that his job?

350
00:15:49,074 --> 00:15:51,993
- Fine, but if I find out you
did this, I will destroy you.

351
00:15:57,165 --> 00:16:00,251
It's just a my internet
provider, you know?

352
00:16:05,423 --> 00:16:06,508
What am I gonna do?

353
00:16:06,549 --> 00:16:08,468
I have to kill this
article somehow.

354
00:16:09,594 --> 00:16:14,057
On the other hand, it could
be my first front page photo.

355
00:16:14,099 --> 00:16:15,392
- You have to stop
being so tight about it

356
00:16:15,433 --> 00:16:17,143
and realize it's just
a party you're in,

357
00:16:17,185 --> 00:16:18,728
nobody cares you're
related to it.

358
00:16:18,770 --> 00:16:21,648
- I care, sorry, sorry.

359
00:16:21,690 --> 00:16:23,817
I'm just, I'm stressed.

360
00:16:23,858 --> 00:16:25,318
Maybe it won't be so bad.

361
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:29,656
Maybe I can just spin this
and keep my name out of it.

362
00:16:29,698 --> 00:16:32,325
- [Andrew] Good luck
with that, gotta go.

363
00:16:32,367 --> 00:16:35,036
(gentle music)

364
00:16:41,918 --> 00:16:45,505
(gentle music continues)

365
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:57,809
- Huh, reminds me of home.

366
00:16:57,851 --> 00:17:01,479
- Do you have a year round
Christmas Cafe in Bangkok too?

367
00:17:01,521 --> 00:17:02,689
- No.

368
00:17:02,731 --> 00:17:03,940
But the Butterfly Pea Milk,

369
00:17:03,982 --> 00:17:06,526
my grandma makes
it during summers.

370
00:17:06,568 --> 00:17:07,902
- I've never had it.

371
00:17:07,944 --> 00:17:09,446
I'm usually a classic hot
chocolate kind of gal.

372
00:17:09,487 --> 00:17:11,322
- Oh, you'll have to try
it then, it's the best.

373
00:17:11,364 --> 00:17:13,408
- I'm sure it's just like home.

374
00:17:14,284 --> 00:17:16,536
So where exactly is home?

375
00:17:16,578 --> 00:17:21,833
You're from Bangkok, but you
have a South African accent.

376
00:17:23,168 --> 00:17:25,795
- I'm impressed, that's not
an easy accent to pin down.

377
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:28,089
Yeah, I'm kind of
from everywhere.

378
00:17:28,131 --> 00:17:29,215
I grew up in South Africa,

379
00:17:29,257 --> 00:17:31,259
but my family moved
around for a bit.

380
00:17:31,301 --> 00:17:33,386
My father worked
as an ambassador.

381
00:17:33,428 --> 00:17:36,056
We ended up in Bangkok to
be closer to my grandmother

382
00:17:36,097 --> 00:17:38,058
and my mom's side of the family.

383
00:17:38,099 --> 00:17:40,393
I'd say that's where
home is for me.

384
00:17:40,435 --> 00:17:42,479
Home is where the
family is, right?

385
00:17:43,938 --> 00:17:44,814
- I guess.

386
00:17:46,066 --> 00:17:49,778
- Two snowy Butterfly
Pea Milk Bobas please.

387
00:17:49,819 --> 00:17:50,737
Oh, my treat.

388
00:17:51,696 --> 00:17:52,739
- Thank you.

389
00:17:54,282 --> 00:17:55,617
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

390
00:17:57,118 --> 00:17:59,746
- So Liv Rose.

391
00:18:00,997 --> 00:18:02,207
Why photography?

392
00:18:03,792 --> 00:18:07,671
- I've just always liked to
see the beauty in the ordinary.

393
00:18:07,712 --> 00:18:11,508
So much happens around us,
especially in a city like this.

394
00:18:11,549 --> 00:18:14,177
Most people just walk
by without ever noticing

395
00:18:14,219 --> 00:18:16,805
something incredible
right in front of them.

396
00:18:16,846 --> 00:18:18,306
- I get that.

397
00:18:18,348 --> 00:18:20,767
It's the same for
me in journalism.

398
00:18:20,809 --> 00:18:22,352
There are stories everywhere

399
00:18:22,394 --> 00:18:24,604
if you take the time to look.

400
00:18:24,646 --> 00:18:25,855
- True.

401
00:18:25,897 --> 00:18:28,316
Though, some stories
are best left untold.

402
00:18:28,358 --> 00:18:30,694
- Two Butterfly Pea Milk Bobas.

403
00:18:30,735 --> 00:18:31,903
- Looks good.

404
00:18:31,945 --> 00:18:33,780
Let's grab a seat.
- Cheers.

405
00:18:38,827 --> 00:18:40,412
- Hey, this is good.

406
00:18:40,453 --> 00:18:42,747
- That popping boba
is a fun twist.

407
00:18:44,249 --> 00:18:45,500
- Oh, are you one of those guys

408
00:18:45,542 --> 00:18:47,836
who takes pictures of
everything he eats?

409
00:18:49,170 --> 00:18:50,338
- It's for my family.

410
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:52,382
My grandma will get
a kick out of this.

411
00:18:53,174 --> 00:18:54,968
You don't want to take one too?

412
00:18:55,010 --> 00:18:56,428
I saw your feed the other day,

413
00:18:56,469 --> 00:18:58,054
it'd they go great with your

414
00:18:58,096 --> 00:19:00,306
Christmas in San
Francisco series.

415
00:19:00,348 --> 00:19:01,683
- You looked me up.

416
00:19:01,725 --> 00:19:03,810
I didn't realize you
were so obsessed with me.

417
00:19:03,852 --> 00:19:05,979
- Classic deflection,
that won't work on me.

418
00:19:06,021 --> 00:19:07,856
Talking to people is my job.

419
00:19:07,897 --> 00:19:09,232
- I don't post selfies.

420
00:19:09,274 --> 00:19:11,985
Liv Rose stays strictly
behind the camera.

421
00:19:12,027 --> 00:19:13,903
- Why not? The
fans would love it.

422
00:19:13,945 --> 00:19:15,071
A chance to see the real you.

423
00:19:15,113 --> 00:19:16,698
- Don't we have
a story to cover?

424
00:19:17,741 --> 00:19:18,533
- Right?

425
00:19:18,575 --> 00:19:19,993
How about we dive right in

426
00:19:20,035 --> 00:19:22,245
and interview the
Changs right now?

427
00:19:22,287 --> 00:19:23,371
- Like right now?

428
00:19:23,413 --> 00:19:24,831
- Why not? I'm sure
there'll be some

429
00:19:24,873 --> 00:19:26,374
great photo opportunities

430
00:19:26,416 --> 00:19:29,002
unless you want me
to do it myself.

431
00:19:29,044 --> 00:19:30,295
- Okay, sure.

432
00:19:31,379 --> 00:19:34,799
But first I think we can
make one quick pit stop.

433
00:19:34,841 --> 00:19:35,884
- Sure.

434
00:19:35,925 --> 00:19:38,595
(upbeat music)

435
00:19:43,308 --> 00:19:46,061
(upbeat music)

436
00:19:53,151 --> 00:19:56,780
(upbeat music continues)

437
00:19:58,907 --> 00:19:59,783
- Hi.

438
00:20:00,867 --> 00:20:03,078
- So what's so important
about this place

439
00:20:03,119 --> 00:20:06,456
that we have to see it before
meeting with the Changs?

440
00:20:06,498 --> 00:20:09,918
- Well, one of the big
draws behind the party

441
00:20:09,959 --> 00:20:11,878
is the larger than
life decorations.

442
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:14,631
And the woman behind
the mall, Mrs. Lin,

443
00:20:14,673 --> 00:20:16,383
there's no Changtastic
Christmas party

444
00:20:16,424 --> 00:20:18,259
without her contributions.

445
00:20:18,301 --> 00:20:20,220
- For someone who doesn't
care for the party,

446
00:20:20,261 --> 00:20:22,263
you sure have some helpful info.

447
00:20:23,181 --> 00:20:26,476
- Everyone in China
Town knows Mrs. Lin.

448
00:20:26,518 --> 00:20:27,977
Her English isn't great though,

449
00:20:28,019 --> 00:20:31,898
so I'll take the lead and
talk to her in Cantonese.

450
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:32,816
- Sure.

451
00:20:35,985 --> 00:20:38,655
(gentle music)

452
00:20:45,787 --> 00:20:49,332
(gentle music continues)

453
00:20:54,504 --> 00:20:56,840
(speaking foreign language)

454
00:20:56,881 --> 00:20:58,133
Why don't you take
a look around?

455
00:20:58,174 --> 00:21:00,301
I'll make sure she
has time to chat.

456
00:21:04,639 --> 00:21:06,266
- I can't believe
remember the last time

457
00:21:06,307 --> 00:21:07,767
I heard you speak Cantonese.

458
00:21:07,809 --> 00:21:09,644
- Oh, well my friend
is trying to learn.

459
00:21:09,686 --> 00:21:11,104
I wanna immerse him.

460
00:21:11,146 --> 00:21:13,189
- You're teaching him?

461
00:21:13,231 --> 00:21:14,941
Your Cantonese is terrible.

462
00:21:19,029 --> 00:21:22,949
(speaking foreign language)

463
00:21:26,369 --> 00:21:30,165
(speaking foreign language)

464
00:21:32,625 --> 00:21:36,379
(speaking foreign language)

465
00:21:41,301 --> 00:21:44,137
- And could you possibly not
mention that I'm a Chang?

466
00:21:44,179 --> 00:21:46,514
- What, Liv, you're
not making sense.

467
00:21:46,556 --> 00:21:50,352
(speaking foreign language)

468
00:21:51,227 --> 00:21:53,938
(upbeat music)

469
00:21:56,900 --> 00:22:00,028
- Can you ask her about her
inspiration for the decorations

470
00:22:00,070 --> 00:22:01,905
and how she came
to know the Changs?

471
00:22:01,946 --> 00:22:04,240
- Of course, I have it handled.

472
00:22:15,502 --> 00:22:16,419
- Huh?

473
00:22:18,963 --> 00:22:21,466
- You know Mrs. Lin was one
of the original attendees

474
00:22:21,508 --> 00:22:22,801
at the party.

475
00:22:22,842 --> 00:22:26,846
(speaking foreign language)

476
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:34,396
(speaking foreign language)

477
00:22:36,439 --> 00:22:39,359
- You should have Liv
introduce you to the Changs,

478
00:22:39,401 --> 00:22:40,777
they're not far.

479
00:22:41,403 --> 00:22:42,570
- Oh, so you know them?

480
00:22:42,612 --> 00:22:44,030
- Of course, she's their-

481
00:22:44,072 --> 00:22:46,366
- Neighbor, neighbor basically.

482
00:22:46,408 --> 00:22:49,452
In fact, we should go
to their house now.

483
00:22:49,494 --> 00:22:51,079
Mrs. Lin, could
you please email us

484
00:22:51,121 --> 00:22:53,373
all of the information
like we discussed?

485
00:22:53,415 --> 00:22:54,249
- What?

486
00:22:54,290 --> 00:22:55,500
- Great, perfect.

487
00:22:55,542 --> 00:22:56,459
Come on, Henry.

488
00:22:59,879 --> 00:23:01,506
(speaking foreign language)

489
00:23:01,548 --> 00:23:03,383
- So you can speak Cantonese.

490
00:23:03,425 --> 00:23:05,135
- And you can speak English.

491
00:23:06,136 --> 00:23:07,846
- Just one quick question,

492
00:23:07,887 --> 00:23:11,266
Liv's last name is
Chang, isn't it?

493
00:23:13,268 --> 00:23:14,310
She's their daughter.

494
00:23:16,104 --> 00:23:17,856
- Don't mind her strangeness,

495
00:23:17,897 --> 00:23:20,608
she hasn't had a
boyfriend in a while.

496
00:23:20,650 --> 00:23:23,445
- Thanks again, Mrs. Lin,
you've been very helpful.

497
00:23:23,486 --> 00:23:27,282
(speaking foreign language)

498
00:23:29,284 --> 00:23:31,119
- Hi Andrew, it's me.

499
00:23:31,161 --> 00:23:34,372
I need you to get mom and
dad out of the house now.

500
00:23:35,415 --> 00:23:37,834
I don't have time to
explain, just do it, please.

501
00:23:41,171 --> 00:23:42,297
Everything okay in there?

502
00:23:42,339 --> 00:23:44,466
- Yep, just admiring
her decorations.

503
00:23:45,925 --> 00:23:47,886
Should we head to the Chang's?

504
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:50,138
- Sure.

505
00:23:50,180 --> 00:23:52,974
(upbeat music)

506
00:24:00,023 --> 00:24:01,649
Well, guess they're not home,

507
00:24:01,691 --> 00:24:02,942
we'll have to come
back tomorrow.

508
00:24:02,984 --> 00:24:05,320
- Well, let's give it a minute.

509
00:24:05,362 --> 00:24:06,321
Hey, do they have kids?

510
00:24:06,363 --> 00:24:07,781
Maybe they live nearby.

511
00:24:07,822 --> 00:24:10,325
- I'm just gonna take some
photos of the exterior.

512
00:24:11,451 --> 00:24:13,995
- We could interview
some of the neighbors,

513
00:24:14,037 --> 00:24:16,289
kill some time
until they get back.

514
00:24:16,331 --> 00:24:19,959
- We could do that, but what
if they're out all night?

515
00:24:20,001 --> 00:24:23,963
How about I treat you to one
of my own Christmas traditions?

516
00:24:24,005 --> 00:24:25,507
It's not like we're gonna
be making any headway

517
00:24:25,548 --> 00:24:27,467
without them here anyway.

518
00:24:27,509 --> 00:24:29,094
We could come back tomorrow.

519
00:24:30,053 --> 00:24:31,137
- I suppose you're right.

520
00:24:31,179 --> 00:24:32,931
We won't be making any progress

521
00:24:32,972 --> 00:24:36,059
until we get past
this roadblock.

522
00:24:37,936 --> 00:24:39,396
What did you have in mind?

523
00:24:40,397 --> 00:24:43,066
(upbeat music)

524
00:24:48,488 --> 00:24:50,365
So this is one of your
favorite things to do

525
00:24:50,407 --> 00:24:52,909
during Christmas,
take a boat ride?

526
00:24:52,951 --> 00:24:55,120
- Just wait until
you see the city

527
00:24:55,161 --> 00:24:59,499
lit up in Christmas
lights, it's magical.

528
00:25:00,583 --> 00:25:02,419
- You know, I have always
wanted to experience

529
00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:03,712
a Christmas in America.

530
00:25:03,753 --> 00:25:05,088
- It's wonderful,

531
00:25:05,130 --> 00:25:06,965
but I think it can
be easy to forget

532
00:25:07,007 --> 00:25:12,262
the true meaning of
Christmas and overdo things.

533
00:25:12,971 --> 00:25:15,015
- Kind of like the Changs.

534
00:25:17,767 --> 00:25:19,686
- There's something
I need to tell you.

535
00:25:19,728 --> 00:25:22,605
(boat bell rings)

536
00:25:24,566 --> 00:25:26,693
Nevermind, it can wait.

537
00:25:37,662 --> 00:25:40,081
* Can you feel it in the air *

538
00:25:40,123 --> 00:25:42,917
* Good times are
gonna last forever *

539
00:25:42,959 --> 00:25:45,420
* Baby, it's a time to share *

540
00:25:45,462 --> 00:25:48,715
* Because tonight we're
gonna be together *

541
00:25:48,757 --> 00:25:51,551
* I'm waiting under
the mistletoe *

542
00:25:51,593 --> 00:25:54,137
* Won't you let us know *

543
00:25:54,179 --> 00:25:56,723
* So long, it feels forever *

544
00:25:56,765 --> 00:26:02,187
* Oh baby, let's get
together this Christmas *

545
00:26:02,812 --> 00:26:04,230
- You don't have to walk me home

546
00:26:04,272 --> 00:26:07,484
- Oh, don't worry, I'd love
to see more of this city.

547
00:26:09,319 --> 00:26:13,782
- I'm sorry, tonight was
such a bust with the Changs.

548
00:26:13,823 --> 00:26:15,992
Maybe we'll have
better luck tomorrow.

549
00:26:17,077 --> 00:26:20,163
- I really hope so, I'd
love to crack this story.

550
00:26:21,039 --> 00:26:25,710
And tonight wasn't a
bust, it was magical.

551
00:26:27,337 --> 00:26:30,048
- Well, I'm so glad
you could see the city

552
00:26:30,090 --> 00:26:31,966
from a new perspective.

553
00:26:32,008 --> 00:26:35,470
(upbeat festive music)

554
00:26:40,266 --> 00:26:44,604
(upbeat festive music continues)

555
00:26:51,486 --> 00:26:52,821
Okay, family,

556
00:26:52,862 --> 00:26:54,572
what did I tell you about
not throwing parties

557
00:26:54,614 --> 00:26:55,657
in my apartment?

558
00:26:55,699 --> 00:26:57,117
- Hi honey.
- Hi sweetheart.

559
00:26:57,158 --> 00:26:58,576
We're just filling
the place with life.

560
00:26:58,618 --> 00:27:02,372
- Mom, please, no
Christmas stockings.

561
00:27:02,414 --> 00:27:04,749
- What? You have a mantle,
it needed stockings.

562
00:27:04,791 --> 00:27:07,502
(knocking on the door)

563
00:27:07,544 --> 00:27:09,170
- With that attitude,
yours will be filled

564
00:27:09,212 --> 00:27:10,547
with coal anyways.

565
00:27:10,588 --> 00:27:11,965
- Give me that.

566
00:27:12,007 --> 00:27:14,009
- [Jack] Henry, good to see you.

567
00:27:14,050 --> 00:27:15,552
- Henry.
- Henry.

568
00:27:18,263 --> 00:27:22,350
- Well, if it isn't the Changs,
what a pleasant surprise.

569
00:27:22,392 --> 00:27:24,519
Liv, I hope you don't mind,
but your neighbor let me up

570
00:27:24,561 --> 00:27:27,605
and I forgot to give
this back to you.

571
00:27:27,647 --> 00:27:30,650
- Henry, I can explain.

572
00:27:30,692 --> 00:27:33,403
(gentle music)

573
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:41,202
- I just don't understand
why you wouldn't tell him

574
00:27:41,244 --> 00:27:42,746
that you are our daughter.

575
00:27:42,787 --> 00:27:45,290
- I'm really sorry, I know I
should have said something.

576
00:27:46,207 --> 00:27:48,376
You were going to
find out eventually.

577
00:27:49,502 --> 00:27:52,881
- Yeah, I already
figured it out.

578
00:27:52,922 --> 00:27:54,924
You were so hesitant
to this assignment

579
00:27:54,966 --> 00:27:58,136
that I assumed you must
have some connection to it.

580
00:27:58,178 --> 00:28:00,513
And when Mrs. Lin
mentioned your parents.

581
00:28:00,555 --> 00:28:01,848
- You speak Cantonese?

582
00:28:01,890 --> 00:28:03,808
- I spent a year in Guangzhou.

583
00:28:03,850 --> 00:28:06,478
- Wait, you didn't tell
'em you're related to us

584
00:28:06,519 --> 00:28:08,521
and you didn't want
to do this story?

585
00:28:08,563 --> 00:28:11,066
- I didn't wanna
stop it, I just,

586
00:28:11,107 --> 00:28:14,569
I wanna keep my personal and
professional lives separate.

587
00:28:14,611 --> 00:28:15,904
The story's a big deal.

588
00:28:15,945 --> 00:28:17,530
I didn't want people
to think I got it

589
00:28:17,572 --> 00:28:19,449
because I'm related to it.

590
00:28:21,284 --> 00:28:22,660
- I can understand that.

591
00:28:22,702 --> 00:28:25,705
- I was gonna tell you
before the boat ride, I just,

592
00:28:25,747 --> 00:28:27,540
I chickened out.

593
00:28:27,582 --> 00:28:29,209
- Romantic boat ride.

594
00:28:29,250 --> 00:28:31,419
- I know what it's like to
want to be taken seriously

595
00:28:31,461 --> 00:28:32,879
for your work.

596
00:28:32,921 --> 00:28:34,839
I mean, my first story
here has the potential

597
00:28:34,881 --> 00:28:37,050
to be on the front page,
I feel the pressure too.

598
00:28:37,092 --> 00:28:40,762
- Wait, wait, wait, we're
going to be on the front page?

599
00:28:40,804 --> 00:28:42,931
- It's a real possibility.

600
00:28:42,972 --> 00:28:47,477
So long as we're all on the
same team from here on out.

601
00:28:47,519 --> 00:28:48,436
- Of course.

602
00:28:51,231 --> 00:28:53,066
- How about tomorrow
we all sit down

603
00:28:53,108 --> 00:28:54,442
and do a proper interview?

604
00:28:54,484 --> 00:28:57,862
- We would love to have
you over Henry, right, Liv?

605
00:29:00,073 --> 00:29:01,116
- Great.

606
00:29:01,157 --> 00:29:02,826
- All right, Changs,
let's move out.

607
00:29:02,867 --> 00:29:03,868
We'll see y'all tomorrow.

608
00:29:03,910 --> 00:29:05,537
- Okay, good night everyone.

609
00:29:09,624 --> 00:29:12,085
Ah, ah, ah, not so fast.

610
00:29:12,127 --> 00:29:15,422
You had one job, get mom
and dad out of the house,

611
00:29:15,463 --> 00:29:17,799
what could have
possibly possessed you
to bring them here?

612
00:29:17,841 --> 00:29:19,592
- You think I have any
control with those two?

613
00:29:19,634 --> 00:29:21,928
And how was I supposed to know
you'd bring Henry back here.

614
00:29:21,970 --> 00:29:23,263
- He walked me home.

615
00:29:23,304 --> 00:29:25,724
- Oh, after your
romantic boat ride?

616
00:29:25,765 --> 00:29:26,850
- Who are you, Mom?

617
00:29:26,891 --> 00:29:27,809
He's my coworker.

618
00:29:27,851 --> 00:29:29,519
- Well, whatever you say,

619
00:29:29,561 --> 00:29:31,563
and also you should
stop stressing about
this story so much

620
00:29:31,604 --> 00:29:33,314
'cause it's making
you age faster.

621
00:29:34,524 --> 00:29:35,859
(grunts)

622
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:37,944
- Love you.
- Love you.

623
00:29:41,781 --> 00:29:43,908
(upbeat music)

624
00:29:43,950 --> 00:29:47,328
- Henry, I just wanted
to say sorry again

625
00:29:48,496 --> 00:29:50,040
about lying to you.

626
00:29:51,750 --> 00:29:55,128
- It's okay, but
we are journalists,

627
00:29:55,170 --> 00:29:57,922
the truth is what
we're all about.

628
00:29:58,965 --> 00:30:00,842
We do need to trust each other.

629
00:30:01,676 --> 00:30:04,471
- I know, no more secrets.

630
00:30:05,472 --> 00:30:07,223
- All right, then we're good.

631
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:10,810
- Oh, just one second.

632
00:30:10,852 --> 00:30:13,605
(gentle music)

633
00:30:20,528 --> 00:30:23,156
- Do you think we could keep
me being a Chang between us

634
00:30:23,198 --> 00:30:26,201
for now, I want Charles
to hear it from me.

635
00:30:26,993 --> 00:30:29,204
- Sure, I can do that.

636
00:30:30,705 --> 00:30:31,623
- Thanks.

637
00:30:32,832 --> 00:30:36,044
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

638
00:30:39,756 --> 00:30:42,133
- I still can't get
over these decorations.

639
00:30:43,635 --> 00:30:45,553
- Wait 'til you see the inside.

640
00:30:46,471 --> 00:30:49,140
(upbeat music)

641
00:30:54,396 --> 00:30:55,271
- Welcome.

642
00:30:56,147 --> 00:30:57,982
- Hi.
- Come on in.

643
00:30:58,692 --> 00:30:59,859
- Hey.
- Hi.

644
00:30:59,901 --> 00:31:01,945
- Here, let me take your coats.

645
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:06,241
- [Liv] Told you the
inside was something.

646
00:31:07,534 --> 00:31:08,535
- Oh, a paról.

647
00:31:09,786 --> 00:31:10,912
- It is.

648
00:31:10,954 --> 00:31:11,871
- Are you Filipino?

649
00:31:11,913 --> 00:31:13,832
- Half Filipino, half Chinese.

650
00:31:13,873 --> 00:31:16,126
- And 100% beautiful.

651
00:31:17,377 --> 00:31:19,379
- Okay, let's go
into the kitchen.

652
00:31:21,214 --> 00:31:22,799
- Henry, my man, what's good?

653
00:31:22,841 --> 00:31:24,300
- Andrew, good to see you.

654
00:31:28,013 --> 00:31:29,389
- Really, Andrew?

655
00:31:31,474 --> 00:31:33,309
- Hey, thanks so much
for having me over.

656
00:31:33,351 --> 00:31:35,020
I'm looking forward
to writing this story,

657
00:31:35,061 --> 00:31:37,022
but if I'm honest,
I'm even more excited

658
00:31:37,063 --> 00:31:39,524
about experiencing a
Changtastic Christmas.

659
00:31:39,566 --> 00:31:41,985
I can tell it's gonna be
everything I've dreamed about.

660
00:31:42,027 --> 00:31:45,405
- Oh, you hear that, Liv,
he's dreaming above you.

661
00:31:45,447 --> 00:31:47,032
- Mom.

662
00:31:47,073 --> 00:31:48,575
- I just meant I've
always imagined

663
00:31:48,616 --> 00:31:51,411
the meaningful ways people
celebrate the holidays here.

664
00:31:51,453 --> 00:31:55,582
And yours is such a unique
take, the fusion of cultures.

665
00:31:55,623 --> 00:31:57,083
- Exactly.

666
00:31:57,125 --> 00:31:59,002
Fusion is what we're doing
with these dumplings too.

667
00:31:59,044 --> 00:32:02,088
Today's dish, baked
sweet potato dumplings

668
00:32:02,130 --> 00:32:04,966
with marshmallow
soy sauce glaze.

669
00:32:05,008 --> 00:32:06,885
- Hmm. I've never tried
anything like that.

670
00:32:06,926 --> 00:32:08,219
- Nobody has.

671
00:32:08,261 --> 00:32:10,055
- The real secret ingredient,

672
00:32:12,724 --> 00:32:15,727
satsumaimo, Japanese
sweet potato.

673
00:32:15,769 --> 00:32:17,645
- Last year he made
chowchow tamales

674
00:32:17,687 --> 00:32:21,775
and the year before spanakopita
stuffed with Peking duck.

675
00:32:21,816 --> 00:32:23,777
They were delicious.

676
00:32:23,818 --> 00:32:25,695
- I still dream
about those tamales.

677
00:32:26,780 --> 00:32:29,699
- I love the passion, which
you clearly bring to the party,

678
00:32:29,741 --> 00:32:31,451
and I'm sure it extends
beyond the food.

679
00:32:31,493 --> 00:32:33,787
This really must take
a lot of work though.

680
00:32:33,828 --> 00:32:36,498
Do you ever cut back a little?

681
00:32:36,539 --> 00:32:37,415
Make things simpler?

682
00:32:37,457 --> 00:32:39,459
Perhaps take a break?

683
00:32:39,501 --> 00:32:41,127
- Excellent question.

684
00:32:41,169 --> 00:32:43,963
- I don't do simple,
I'm a complicated man.

685
00:32:44,005 --> 00:32:46,299
Be sure to get
that in the story.

686
00:32:46,341 --> 00:32:47,008
- Noted.

687
00:32:47,050 --> 00:32:48,176
- Okay, enough yapping.

688
00:32:48,218 --> 00:32:51,054
These dumplings won't
make themselves.

689
00:32:52,639 --> 00:32:54,099
* Dashing through the snow *

690
00:32:54,140 --> 00:32:56,810
* In a one-horse open sleigh *

691
00:32:56,851 --> 00:32:58,895
* O'er the fields we go *

692
00:32:58,937 --> 00:33:01,272
* Laughing all the way *

693
00:33:01,314 --> 00:33:03,650
* Bells on bobtails ring *

694
00:33:03,692 --> 00:33:06,194
* Making spirits bright *

695
00:33:06,236 --> 00:33:08,154
* What fun it is
to ride and sing *

696
00:33:08,196 --> 00:33:10,865
* A sleighing song tonight *

697
00:33:10,907 --> 00:33:13,159
* Jingle bells, jingle bells *

698
00:33:13,201 --> 00:33:15,328
* Jingle all the way *

699
00:33:15,370 --> 00:33:17,330
* Oh, what fun it is to ride *

700
00:33:17,372 --> 00:33:19,958
* In a one-horse open sleigh. *

701
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:23,169
- Liv, why is your
dumping so ugly?

702
00:33:23,211 --> 00:33:25,255
- Gotta love that
motherly affection.

703
00:33:25,296 --> 00:33:28,133
- Well do better, Mom gives
me plenty of affection.

704
00:33:28,174 --> 00:33:29,968
- Because you're a good boy,

705
00:33:30,010 --> 00:33:32,012
and look at these
beautiful dumplings.

706
00:33:32,053 --> 00:33:33,221
- You know what?

707
00:33:33,263 --> 00:33:36,141
I think I'll be more
useful taking pictures.

708
00:33:36,182 --> 00:33:38,351
You guys seem to have
this under control.

709
00:33:38,393 --> 00:33:41,146
(upbeat music)

710
00:33:44,232 --> 00:33:46,651
- Do you want me to take
one so you can get in here

711
00:33:46,693 --> 00:33:48,028
with the fam?

712
00:33:48,069 --> 00:33:51,031
- You know my rule,
strictly behind the lens.

713
00:33:51,072 --> 00:33:53,283
* Jingle bells, jingle bells *

714
00:33:53,324 --> 00:33:55,285
* Jingle all the way *

715
00:33:55,326 --> 00:33:57,287
* Oh, what fun it is to ride *

716
00:33:57,328 --> 00:33:59,581
* In a one-horse
open sleigh, hey *

717
00:33:59,622 --> 00:34:01,416
- There you go.

718
00:34:01,458 --> 00:34:02,834
- Thanks dad.
- Thanks dad.

719
00:34:07,088 --> 00:34:09,132
- Here you are.
- Thank you, honey.

720
00:34:13,678 --> 00:34:14,804
- Hmm.

721
00:34:14,846 --> 00:34:17,432
Oh wow, this hot
chocolate is amazing.

722
00:34:17,474 --> 00:34:19,726
- Yeah, it's like the
one thing Liv does well.

723
00:34:19,768 --> 00:34:21,227
She makes a huge batch
for the party every year.

724
00:34:21,269 --> 00:34:22,729
- Look at this, Henry,

725
00:34:22,771 --> 00:34:26,775
this is from our first
Christmas party 25 years ago,

726
00:34:26,816 --> 00:34:30,070
back when it was just a few
friends in our living room.

727
00:34:30,111 --> 00:34:32,197
- Hey, is this that Mrs. Lin?

728
00:34:32,238 --> 00:34:33,615
- [Jack] Yeah, that's right.

729
00:34:33,656 --> 00:34:37,619
- We used to repurpose
decorations from other holidays.

730
00:34:37,660 --> 00:34:39,829
These lanterns were from
our friends' wedding.

731
00:34:39,871 --> 00:34:42,707
It was Liv's idea to
turn them into ornaments.

732
00:34:42,749 --> 00:34:44,376
She's so smart.

733
00:34:44,417 --> 00:34:46,169
Very smart.

734
00:34:46,211 --> 00:34:47,754
Very single.

735
00:34:47,796 --> 00:34:49,673
- Mom, seriously.

736
00:34:49,714 --> 00:34:52,676
I'm sorry, please,
ignore this woman.

737
00:34:52,717 --> 00:34:56,513
- Don't worry, my mom does
this to me all the time.

738
00:34:56,554 --> 00:34:57,514
Makes me miss her.

739
00:34:58,723 --> 00:35:00,600
This is really wonderful
Mr. and Mrs. Chang.

740
00:35:00,642 --> 00:35:03,019
I'd love to help out as I
keep working on the story,

741
00:35:03,061 --> 00:35:04,813
is there anything
else I could do?

742
00:35:05,939 --> 00:35:09,567
- How about you and Liv
deliver the invitations for us?

743
00:35:09,609 --> 00:35:11,152
- Hey, that's our job.

744
00:35:12,278 --> 00:35:15,281
I mean, it would be a big help.

745
00:35:16,157 --> 00:35:17,575
- Jack and I usually
do it together,

746
00:35:17,617 --> 00:35:19,953
but it would be nice if you
could take it over for us

747
00:35:19,994 --> 00:35:20,912
this year.

748
00:35:22,038 --> 00:35:24,541
- Okay, great.

749
00:35:27,836 --> 00:35:30,005
Oh, what happened here?

750
00:35:30,046 --> 00:35:32,757
- Oh, that's the year
Liv became too cool

751
00:35:32,799 --> 00:35:34,384
for a Changtastic Christmas.

752
00:35:34,426 --> 00:35:36,761
- Just your average
moody teenager.

753
00:35:38,596 --> 00:35:43,852
- You know, when Liv was little,
she used to get so excited.

754
00:35:45,478 --> 00:35:48,857
She would put on a
performance of "Oh Holy Night"

755
00:35:48,898 --> 00:35:50,316
in Cantonese.

756
00:35:50,358 --> 00:35:53,445
It was the crown jewel
of the whole party.

757
00:35:53,486 --> 00:35:55,238
And now all we can get her to do

758
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:57,449
is be the party photographer.

759
00:35:57,490 --> 00:35:59,576
- Well, that's an important job.

760
00:35:59,617 --> 00:36:00,452
- Thank you, Henry.

761
00:36:00,493 --> 00:36:01,995
- That's also very convenient,

762
00:36:02,037 --> 00:36:03,788
that way you don't have
to be in the photos.

763
00:36:03,830 --> 00:36:04,789
- Hah.

764
00:36:04,831 --> 00:36:06,249
- Okay.

765
00:36:06,291 --> 00:36:09,794
Don't you have any more
questions for my parents?

766
00:36:10,670 --> 00:36:11,713
- Could you tell
me a bit more about

767
00:36:11,755 --> 00:36:12,881
the history of the party?

768
00:36:12,922 --> 00:36:15,800
- Oh, settle in,
we've got all night.

769
00:36:15,842 --> 00:36:18,553
(upbeat music)

770
00:36:23,475 --> 00:36:26,186
(upbeat music)

771
00:36:28,396 --> 00:36:29,856
- I know you're a
thorough journalist,

772
00:36:29,898 --> 00:36:32,692
but you don't have to keep
helping out with the party.

773
00:36:32,734 --> 00:36:34,611
- Oh, I don't mind, it's nice.

774
00:36:34,652 --> 00:36:36,654
Feels like I'm helping
out my own family.

775
00:36:36,696 --> 00:36:38,865
Plus, they're good people.

776
00:36:38,907 --> 00:36:40,700
- Yeah, they are.

777
00:36:40,742 --> 00:36:43,036
But they can also be
set in their ways.

778
00:36:43,078 --> 00:36:44,913
In sixth grade, I
looked like a mushroom

779
00:36:44,954 --> 00:36:48,291
because my mom insisted on
cutting my hair herself.

780
00:36:48,333 --> 00:36:50,001
- I know, I saw the photos.

781
00:36:53,546 --> 00:36:54,714
- Envelope, please.

782
00:36:57,342 --> 00:37:00,303
- It's pretty cool that Andrew
designs these every year.

783
00:37:00,345 --> 00:37:01,638
- Yeah, he's pretty talented.

784
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:03,848
But don't tell him
I said anything.

785
00:37:04,683 --> 00:37:06,726
Merry Christmas Mrs. Chen.

786
00:37:07,394 --> 00:37:08,269
Bye.

787
00:37:12,357 --> 00:37:14,526
- There are a lot of these.

788
00:37:14,567 --> 00:37:16,569
- Yeah, tell me about it.

789
00:37:16,611 --> 00:37:19,322
All of the guests return
these stuffed with donations

790
00:37:19,364 --> 00:37:20,907
and personal messages,

791
00:37:20,949 --> 00:37:23,743
and then they're all attached
to a money tree at the party

792
00:37:23,785 --> 00:37:26,246
where a random
envelope is selected,

793
00:37:26,287 --> 00:37:29,958
whoever it is gets to present
all of the money collected

794
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,459
to the community fund,

795
00:37:31,501 --> 00:37:35,714
which supports afterschool
clubs, tutoring, music, sports.

796
00:37:35,755 --> 00:37:38,341
Hey Liv.
- Hi Mrs. Mendez.

797
00:37:38,383 --> 00:37:40,051
- Fancy seeing you here.

798
00:37:41,011 --> 00:37:42,053
- Thank you.

799
00:37:43,096 --> 00:37:44,014
Here you go.

800
00:37:44,055 --> 00:37:45,223
- Thank you.

801
00:37:45,265 --> 00:37:47,225
Any intel on your dad's
dish for this year?

802
00:37:47,267 --> 00:37:50,186
- Oh, sorry, my lips are sealed.

803
00:37:50,228 --> 00:37:51,938
Okay, well see you at the party.

804
00:37:51,980 --> 00:37:52,814
- Bye.

805
00:37:54,065 --> 00:37:56,359
- You seem to know your
neighbors pretty well.

806
00:37:56,401 --> 00:38:00,280
- Yeah, it's a
tight-knit community.

807
00:38:00,321 --> 00:38:01,489
- It's great.

808
00:38:01,531 --> 00:38:03,033
Even in a big city,

809
00:38:03,074 --> 00:38:06,703
you can still experience the
warmth of a close neighborhood.

810
00:38:06,745 --> 00:38:08,538
- I don't know, I've
always been uncomfortable

811
00:38:08,580 --> 00:38:11,166
with how much everyone
knows my business.

812
00:38:11,833 --> 00:38:13,209
- This party seems pretty great,

813
00:38:13,251 --> 00:38:16,046
I don't understand why
you're so resistant to it.

814
00:38:16,087 --> 00:38:17,213
- I know you don't.

815
00:38:17,255 --> 00:38:18,757
Fortunately, this
story isn't about me,

816
00:38:18,798 --> 00:38:21,551
so you don't need
to worry about it.

817
00:38:21,593 --> 00:38:23,470
* We wish you Merry Christmas. *

818
00:38:23,511 --> 00:38:25,430
* We wish you Merry Christmas. *

819
00:38:25,472 --> 00:38:27,557
* We wish you Merry Christmas. *

820
00:38:27,599 --> 00:38:30,060
* And a happy new Year. *

821
00:38:30,101 --> 00:38:32,062
* Good tidings we bring
to you and your king *

822
00:38:32,103 --> 00:38:34,189
- After we're done
delivering all of these,

823
00:38:34,230 --> 00:38:36,691
do you mind if we stop by
Mrs. Lin's store again?

824
00:38:36,733 --> 00:38:39,027
I want to get something
for your parents

825
00:38:39,069 --> 00:38:42,781
for letting me be part of the
full Changtastic experience.

826
00:38:44,366 --> 00:38:46,451
- That's very sweet.

827
00:38:46,493 --> 00:38:49,245
(upbeat music)

828
00:38:57,629 --> 00:38:58,755
- I hope they like it.

829
00:38:58,797 --> 00:39:00,340
- I'm sure they'll love it.

830
00:39:03,468 --> 00:39:05,762
- Did you know that all the
China Towns around the world

831
00:39:05,804 --> 00:39:09,307
have a similar look
because of this China Town?

832
00:39:09,349 --> 00:39:10,725
- No, I didn't.

833
00:39:10,767 --> 00:39:12,769
- After the 1906 earthquake,

834
00:39:12,811 --> 00:39:15,814
a group of Chinese Americans
hired non-Chinese planners

835
00:39:15,855 --> 00:39:20,318
to rebuild and create a family
friendly hub for tourism.

836
00:39:21,486 --> 00:39:24,489
What they ended up with was
something not quite Chinese,

837
00:39:24,531 --> 00:39:26,700
but not quite American.

838
00:39:28,243 --> 00:39:29,452
- How do you know all of this?

839
00:39:29,494 --> 00:39:31,663
- I'm a journalist,
I did my research.

840
00:39:33,415 --> 00:39:35,709
Don't they teach this in school?

841
00:39:35,750 --> 00:39:37,836
- No, actually they don't.

842
00:39:38,962 --> 00:39:42,340
But there is one place I know
a little something about.

843
00:39:43,299 --> 00:39:46,011
(upbeat music)

844
00:39:47,721 --> 00:39:51,182
Welcome to the oldest
cathedral in California.

845
00:39:51,224 --> 00:39:53,727
It was where my great
grandparents learned English

846
00:39:53,768 --> 00:39:55,228
way back when

847
00:39:55,270 --> 00:39:58,481
and my mom forced us to go
to Saturday Chinese school.

848
00:39:58,523 --> 00:40:01,192
(gentle music)

849
00:40:09,451 --> 00:40:13,038
(gentle music continues)

850
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:17,083
It's beautiful in
here, isn't it?

851
00:40:18,585 --> 00:40:19,669
- It really is.

852
00:40:19,711 --> 00:40:22,464
(gentle music)

853
00:40:26,551 --> 00:40:29,763
(gentle music continues)

854
00:40:29,804 --> 00:40:32,223
- This church has been a
symbol of East meets West

855
00:40:32,265 --> 00:40:33,475
for over a century.

856
00:40:35,018 --> 00:40:38,521
The stone foundation was cut
and made to order in China,

857
00:40:38,563 --> 00:40:40,982
and the brick came
from New England.

858
00:40:43,234 --> 00:40:45,403
It was also the first
Chinese mission.

859
00:40:47,906 --> 00:40:48,573
- Hello.

860
00:40:48,615 --> 00:40:49,532
- Hi.

861
00:40:49,574 --> 00:40:51,368
- Welcome to Old St. Mary's.

862
00:40:51,409 --> 00:40:55,080
Don't forget to light a candle
and say a Christmas prayer.

863
00:41:02,587 --> 00:41:03,963
- I used to love
coming to church

864
00:41:04,005 --> 00:41:08,009
with my family to light candles,
especially at Christmas.

865
00:41:09,010 --> 00:41:11,763
Every candle here is
someone's prayers.

866
00:41:12,722 --> 00:41:15,558
Just imagine if each
prayer is answered,

867
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:17,977
how much good is
happening in the world?

868
00:41:23,066 --> 00:41:24,984
Should we light some of our own?

869
00:41:26,486 --> 00:41:27,737
- Sure.

870
00:41:27,779 --> 00:41:30,490
(gentle music)

871
00:41:38,665 --> 00:41:42,293
(gentle music continues)

872
00:41:48,675 --> 00:41:52,262
(gentle music continues)

873
00:41:58,643 --> 00:42:02,188
(gentle music continues)

874
00:42:08,486 --> 00:42:11,114
(gentle music continues)

875
00:42:11,156 --> 00:42:12,615
- What?

876
00:42:12,657 --> 00:42:15,410
- I was just thinking how
this was a really nice way

877
00:42:15,452 --> 00:42:16,911
to end the day.

878
00:42:18,705 --> 00:42:21,332
Thanks for sharing it with me.

879
00:42:22,334 --> 00:42:23,960
- My pleasure.

880
00:42:24,002 --> 00:42:25,962
And thank you for
teaching me some history

881
00:42:26,004 --> 00:42:27,630
about my own city.

882
00:42:27,672 --> 00:42:30,342
(gentle music)

883
00:42:37,766 --> 00:42:40,560
(upbeat music)

884
00:42:44,981 --> 00:42:48,068
- It's so nice of your parents
to have me over for dinner.

885
00:42:48,109 --> 00:42:49,652
I'm getting more than a story,

886
00:42:49,694 --> 00:42:52,364
they've really helped
me feel at home here.

887
00:42:52,405 --> 00:42:54,532
- They're great at
that, aren't they?

888
00:42:56,659 --> 00:43:00,622
(speaking foreign language)

889
00:43:02,290 --> 00:43:04,751
- Did she just say the
cilantro looks sad?

890
00:43:04,793 --> 00:43:06,419
- She sure did.

891
00:43:06,461 --> 00:43:08,755
Mom likes to haggle here
because she feels like

892
00:43:08,797 --> 00:43:10,256
she's connecting to her roots.

893
00:43:10,298 --> 00:43:14,636
But no one haggles in China
Town, it's so embarrassing.

894
00:43:14,678 --> 00:43:17,222
(speaking foreign language)

895
00:43:17,263 --> 00:43:20,183
Go ahead and taste it,
they're so fresh and fragrant.

896
00:43:21,559 --> 00:43:24,646
The tomatoes are,

897
00:43:24,688 --> 00:43:25,605
they're,

898
00:43:26,981 --> 00:43:27,607
ugly.
- Ugly.

899
00:43:27,649 --> 00:43:29,484
- Yep, called it.

900
00:43:29,526 --> 00:43:30,902
(speaking foreign language)

901
00:43:30,944 --> 00:43:32,529
Well, if you are
really not happy,

902
00:43:32,570 --> 00:43:34,989
then I'll make a second
dish for the party,

903
00:43:37,033 --> 00:43:42,497
and go back to Chinese school,
I can barely understand you.

904
00:43:42,914 --> 00:43:44,833
(laughing)

905
00:43:47,127 --> 00:43:50,588
- Oh.

906
00:43:50,630 --> 00:43:53,717
Our next interviewee is ready.

907
00:43:53,758 --> 00:43:56,302
- Oh, you don't wanna
see my mom buy beef?

908
00:43:56,344 --> 00:43:58,013
Mrs. Fung's husband
is the butcher,

909
00:43:58,054 --> 00:44:02,142
and the show always
reaches a climax here.

910
00:44:02,183 --> 00:44:05,854
(speaking foreign language)

911
00:44:12,152 --> 00:44:14,863
(upbeat music)

912
00:44:20,869 --> 00:44:23,371
- The party means so much
to what we're doing here.

913
00:44:23,413 --> 00:44:25,206
- It has that much of an impact?

914
00:44:25,248 --> 00:44:26,666
- Oh yeah, without the party,.

915
00:44:26,708 --> 00:44:27,959
we wouldn't have this equipment

916
00:44:28,001 --> 00:44:30,420
or half the programs
we have going on.

917
00:44:30,462 --> 00:44:34,007
As far as I'm concerned, the
Changs are community heroes.

918
00:44:34,049 --> 00:44:36,217
- They seem like very
inspiring people.

919
00:44:37,260 --> 00:44:38,887
- [Eric] I certainly think so.

920
00:44:40,388 --> 00:44:41,681
- What do you think drives them

921
00:44:41,723 --> 00:44:44,184
to give back to the
community like this?

922
00:44:44,225 --> 00:44:47,145
- Oh, I think Liv can
answer that better than me.

923
00:44:47,187 --> 00:44:49,647
But there was a year
when a few families

924
00:44:49,689 --> 00:44:51,232
were having difficulty affording

925
00:44:51,274 --> 00:44:53,276
the extracurricular programs.

926
00:44:53,318 --> 00:44:55,528
Liv didn't want her
friends feeling left out,

927
00:44:55,570 --> 00:44:58,656
so she's the one that
started giving back.

928
00:44:58,698 --> 00:45:01,201
- So the red envelopes
were your idea?

929
00:45:01,242 --> 00:45:02,452
- The giving back part was,

930
00:45:02,494 --> 00:45:04,412
the envelopes and money
tree were my parents'.

931
00:45:04,454 --> 00:45:05,663
- You'd never imagined that.

932
00:45:05,705 --> 00:45:06,956
- I didn't think
it was relevant.

933
00:45:06,998 --> 00:45:08,792
- To our story
it's all relevant.

934
00:45:08,833 --> 00:45:11,252
- I like to stay behind
the camera, remember?

935
00:45:12,337 --> 00:45:14,964
Anyway, I've got what I
need here, how we looking?

936
00:45:15,006 --> 00:45:17,550
Should we head
back to the office?

937
00:45:17,592 --> 00:45:19,844
- Yeah, I think I'm good here.

938
00:45:19,886 --> 00:45:20,720
Great.

939
00:45:20,762 --> 00:45:21,429
Thanks so much.
- Of course,

940
00:45:21,471 --> 00:45:22,764
see you at the party.

941
00:45:22,806 --> 00:45:24,974
- Bye Liv.
- Bye.

942
00:45:25,016 --> 00:45:27,727
(upbeat music)

943
00:45:35,610 --> 00:45:39,114
(upbeat music continues)

944
00:45:41,700 --> 00:45:42,909
- That must be a good one.

945
00:45:42,951 --> 00:45:45,912
- Oh, it's just a silly
photo for another piece

946
00:45:45,954 --> 00:45:47,330
I'm working on.

947
00:45:47,372 --> 00:45:48,665
How's our story coming?

948
00:45:48,707 --> 00:45:50,417
- I've got a pretty
solid rough draft.

949
00:45:50,458 --> 00:45:52,752
Of course, we still have to
actually attend the party,

950
00:45:52,794 --> 00:45:54,087
but the bulk of it is there.

951
00:45:54,129 --> 00:45:55,463
You know, Liv,

952
00:45:55,505 --> 00:45:57,298
we've got a chance to
make the front page here,

953
00:45:57,340 --> 00:45:59,426
but that might not happen
if you hold that on us.

954
00:45:59,467 --> 00:46:03,054
- Henry, my role in the party
is not important to the story.

955
00:46:03,096 --> 00:46:05,390
- You don't know that,
what if it is the story?

956
00:46:05,432 --> 00:46:06,516
- It's not.

957
00:46:06,558 --> 00:46:08,059
Look, I know this
is about my family,

958
00:46:08,101 --> 00:46:11,104
but I would still like
to maintain some boundary

959
00:46:11,146 --> 00:46:13,857
between my personal
and professional lives.

960
00:46:15,316 --> 00:46:16,234
- Okay.

961
00:46:17,694 --> 00:46:19,821
I don't wanna put you in
an uncomfortable position.

962
00:46:19,863 --> 00:46:21,322
Hopefully Andrew isn't too upset

963
00:46:21,364 --> 00:46:22,907
he isn't named specifically.

964
00:46:24,200 --> 00:46:26,286
- Thanks, Henry, seriously.

965
00:46:26,327 --> 00:46:27,328
- Don't mention it.

966
00:46:30,540 --> 00:46:31,708
And we're off.

967
00:46:32,667 --> 00:46:35,545
Hopefully Charles likes
what we have so far.

968
00:46:35,587 --> 00:46:36,963
You should probably
talk to him though.

969
00:46:37,005 --> 00:46:40,008
The longer you wait, the
worse it's going to get.

970
00:46:40,050 --> 00:46:40,967
- I know.

971
00:46:41,009 --> 00:46:43,720
(gentle music)

972
00:46:44,554 --> 00:46:46,765
- Any interest in
going out to celebrate?

973
00:46:48,391 --> 00:46:50,977
* Dashing through the snow *

974
00:46:51,019 --> 00:46:55,482
* In a one horse open sleigh *

975
00:46:55,523 --> 00:46:56,983
* O'er the fields we go *

976
00:46:57,025 --> 00:46:59,611
- I almost feel guilty for
how much fun I'm having

977
00:46:59,652 --> 00:47:01,863
on my first assignment
in San Francisco.

978
00:47:02,989 --> 00:47:07,827
Here's to a very merry
Christmas and to great teamwork.

979
00:47:07,869 --> 00:47:09,162
- I'll cheers to that.

980
00:47:14,125 --> 00:47:17,253
- Wow, I've never had an
eggnog martini before,

981
00:47:17,295 --> 00:47:18,838
but that is surprisingly good.

982
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:21,675
- It might actually give
snowy Butterfly Pee Milk

983
00:47:21,716 --> 00:47:23,051
a run for its money.

984
00:47:24,844 --> 00:47:27,806
You know, Henry, we've only
been talking about my family

985
00:47:27,847 --> 00:47:31,184
this whole time and I
know nothing about yours.

986
00:47:31,226 --> 00:47:32,519
What about you?

987
00:47:32,560 --> 00:47:34,396
Do you have a big,
loud family too?

988
00:47:34,437 --> 00:47:39,901
- I was the eldest of five, so
it was pure chaos growing up.

989
00:47:40,443 --> 00:47:41,444
- You must miss them.

990
00:47:41,486 --> 00:47:42,696
- I really do.

991
00:47:42,737 --> 00:47:44,447
My family doesn't really
celebrate Christmas,

992
00:47:44,489 --> 00:47:48,702
so I wasn't expecting the
holidays to make me so homesick.

993
00:47:48,743 --> 00:47:50,078
- If it helps.

994
00:47:50,120 --> 00:47:52,414
I'm sure my parents would
be happy to make you

995
00:47:52,455 --> 00:47:55,000
an honorary Chang for Christmas.

996
00:47:55,917 --> 00:47:57,335
- It actually does help.

997
00:47:58,920 --> 00:48:03,550
* O Christmas tree,
O Christmas tree *

998
00:48:03,591 --> 00:48:06,344
* How lovely are thy branches *

999
00:48:06,386 --> 00:48:09,556
- What do you say? Should
we get out there and dance?

1000
00:48:09,597 --> 00:48:11,725
- No, no, no, no, no way.

1001
00:48:11,766 --> 00:48:14,269
And besides, I
have two left feet.

1002
00:48:15,186 --> 00:48:18,064
- Come on, where there's
music, there's dancing.

1003
00:48:18,106 --> 00:48:19,024
It'll be fun.

1004
00:48:27,657 --> 00:48:32,954
* O Christmas tree,
O Christmas tree *

1005
00:48:33,580 --> 00:48:37,584
* How lovely are thy branches *

1006
00:48:37,625 --> 00:48:42,881
* O Christmas tree,
O Christmas tree *

1007
00:48:43,548 --> 00:48:48,428
* How lovely are thy branches *

1008
00:48:50,221 --> 00:48:55,477
* Deck the halls with
boughs of holly *

1009
00:48:57,687 --> 00:49:01,066
* 'Tis the season to be jolly *

1010
00:49:01,107 --> 00:49:05,028
* Fa la la la la, la la la la *

1011
00:49:05,070 --> 00:49:08,531
* Follow me in merry measure *

1012
00:49:08,573 --> 00:49:11,951
* Fa la la la la, la la la la *

1013
00:49:11,993 --> 00:49:15,955
* As we sing of
Yuletide treasure *

1014
00:49:15,997 --> 00:49:20,126
* Fa la la la la, la la la la *

1015
00:49:21,169 --> 00:49:25,924
- Wow, my goodness, oh my
goodness, that was amazing.

1016
00:49:29,844 --> 00:49:30,970
Now I know why your
parents are so bummed

1017
00:49:31,012 --> 00:49:32,263
you don't sing up
the parties anymore.

1018
00:49:32,305 --> 00:49:34,933
- I can't believe
I just did that.

1019
00:49:40,188 --> 00:49:42,148
Now's probably a
good time to call it,

1020
00:49:42,190 --> 00:49:44,818
I don't wanna die
of embarrassment.

1021
00:49:44,859 --> 00:49:47,570
- Yeah, you look like
you're having fun.

1022
00:49:48,738 --> 00:49:51,991
How about a stroll to
top of the evening?

1023
00:49:52,033 --> 00:49:53,201
I'll walk you home.

1024
00:49:56,413 --> 00:49:57,330
- Sure.

1025
00:49:59,666 --> 00:50:02,127
- I had a really
good time tonight.

1026
00:50:02,168 --> 00:50:03,503
- Me too.

1027
00:50:03,545 --> 00:50:06,798
Thanks for pushing me
outside of my comfort zone.

1028
00:50:06,840 --> 00:50:08,216
- Anytime.

1029
00:50:09,759 --> 00:50:11,886
Thanks for letting me unload
about my family back home.

1030
00:50:11,928 --> 00:50:14,180
- Of course, I'm
sure they miss you

1031
00:50:14,222 --> 00:50:16,391
just as much as you miss them.

1032
00:50:16,433 --> 00:50:18,059
I'll bet they're even
bragging to anyone

1033
00:50:18,101 --> 00:50:20,687
who will listen about their
brilliant journalist son

1034
00:50:20,729 --> 00:50:22,981
and his new life in America.

1035
00:50:23,857 --> 00:50:25,734
- Yeah, maybe.

1036
00:50:25,775 --> 00:50:29,696
Unless I don't cut it out here.

1037
00:50:29,738 --> 00:50:31,197
I mean, don't get me wrong,

1038
00:50:31,239 --> 00:50:32,866
The Bangkok Post
is great and all,

1039
00:50:32,907 --> 00:50:36,786
but this is the San
Francisco Chronicle.

1040
00:50:36,828 --> 00:50:38,955
I mean, that's a big deal.

1041
00:50:40,331 --> 00:50:43,501
- Imposture syndrome,
I know it well.

1042
00:50:43,543 --> 00:50:46,254
(gentle music)

1043
00:50:51,259 --> 00:50:54,346
Henry, Charles wouldn't
have taken a chance on you

1044
00:50:54,387 --> 00:50:56,639
if he didn't think
you were great.

1045
00:50:56,681 --> 00:51:00,185
I mean, front page potential,
and from what I've seen,

1046
00:51:00,226 --> 00:51:05,398
you're thorough, compassionate,
good with people, you care.

1047
00:51:06,483 --> 00:51:10,403
And once this article comes
out, everyone is gonna see that.

1048
00:51:10,445 --> 00:51:13,114
(gentle music)

1049
00:51:18,661 --> 00:51:19,579
Oh no.

1050
00:51:24,542 --> 00:51:26,586
- Oh, well look at that.

1051
00:51:28,588 --> 00:51:31,925
- I can't believe it, this has
my mom written all over it.

1052
00:51:31,966 --> 00:51:34,052
I mean, there might as
well be a sign that says,

1053
00:51:34,094 --> 00:51:36,471
"My daughter lives here,
somebody kiss her."

1054
00:51:38,306 --> 00:51:40,016
It's too much.

1055
00:51:40,058 --> 00:51:42,185
- She sure does
go the extra mile.

1056
00:51:46,189 --> 00:51:49,067
Well, I guess I should
probably get home.

1057
00:51:49,818 --> 00:51:52,112
- Yeah, yes, totally.

1058
00:51:54,906 --> 00:51:57,784
Thanks, I'll see you
at work tomorrow.

1059
00:51:57,826 --> 00:52:00,286
- Of course, sounds good.

1060
00:52:00,328 --> 00:52:02,372
- Okay.

1061
00:52:02,414 --> 00:52:05,041
(gentle music)

1062
00:52:14,217 --> 00:52:16,886
(upbeat music)

1063
00:52:22,976 --> 00:52:23,810
- Morning, Liv.

1064
00:52:23,852 --> 00:52:26,855
- Oh hey, Henry, morning.

1065
00:52:28,982 --> 00:52:30,984
- Hey, I got you something,

1066
00:52:31,026 --> 00:52:33,153
a little memento
from last night.

1067
00:52:37,157 --> 00:52:38,783
- That's very funny.

1068
00:52:38,825 --> 00:52:40,368
- Snagged it on my way
to work this morning,

1069
00:52:40,410 --> 00:52:44,164
figured I'd eliminate the threat
of any unwanted affection.

1070
00:52:44,205 --> 00:52:47,000
- Well, it's the nicest
gift I've ever received.

1071
00:52:48,126 --> 00:52:50,837
- Good, you're both
here, in my office.

1072
00:52:54,841 --> 00:52:56,051
There's some good stuff here.

1073
00:52:56,092 --> 00:52:59,637
We got Christmas and fun
and community and spirit

1074
00:52:59,679 --> 00:53:01,097
and so on and so on.

1075
00:53:01,139 --> 00:53:04,851
But it's not there, you
know, something's missing.

1076
00:53:05,685 --> 00:53:07,020
We gotta dig deeper
into the Chang family

1077
00:53:07,062 --> 00:53:09,647
to get to the
heart of the story.

1078
00:53:09,689 --> 00:53:10,815
- Yeah, I know.

1079
00:53:12,067 --> 00:53:14,444
I may have held back on
some of those details.

1080
00:53:14,486 --> 00:53:15,653
- Well put them in there,

1081
00:53:15,695 --> 00:53:17,864
the reader wants a
personal connection.

1082
00:53:18,865 --> 00:53:21,785
- Actually, there's
something I need to confess.

1083
00:53:22,911 --> 00:53:28,208
The thing is, Henry held
back because I asked him to.

1084
00:53:31,878 --> 00:53:33,088
- You asked him to?

1085
00:53:35,215 --> 00:53:38,051
Well, why exactly
did you do that?

1086
00:53:39,719 --> 00:53:42,430
- Wow, well, that didn't
go as well as I'd hoped.

1087
00:53:42,472 --> 00:53:45,809
I don't think I've seen Charles
that disappointed before.

1088
00:53:45,850 --> 00:53:48,186
Surprised he didn't
take me off the story.

1089
00:53:48,228 --> 00:53:51,981
- He didn't take you off because
you are great at your job.

1090
00:53:52,691 --> 00:53:54,901
He knows this is complicated

1091
00:53:54,943 --> 00:53:57,362
and that it took
guts coming clean.

1092
00:53:57,404 --> 00:53:58,405
I'm proud of you.

1093
00:53:59,364 --> 00:54:01,991
(phone rings)

1094
00:54:04,577 --> 00:54:06,121
- Oh, Henry, I gotta run,

1095
00:54:06,162 --> 00:54:07,831
I have to go pick up
the red envelopes.

1096
00:54:07,872 --> 00:54:09,374
- I'll come with you.

1097
00:54:09,416 --> 00:54:12,836
- It's okay, I'll be quick,
and you're busy with the story,

1098
00:54:12,877 --> 00:54:14,713
you have three
days to rewrite it.

1099
00:54:14,754 --> 00:54:16,172
- This is the story.

1100
00:54:16,214 --> 00:54:19,009
I'm not gonna find it by
sitting behind a computer.

1101
00:54:21,219 --> 00:54:22,095
- Let's roll.

1102
00:54:25,223 --> 00:54:26,808
- Thank you, Mrs. Chen.

1103
00:54:31,855 --> 00:54:34,024
- So that was the last one.

1104
00:54:34,065 --> 00:54:36,568
- Thanks for being my pack mule.

1105
00:54:36,609 --> 00:54:37,902
- My pleasure.

1106
00:54:39,362 --> 00:54:42,365
- So you ready to lug that
bag back to my parents?

1107
00:54:42,407 --> 00:54:43,616
- Sure.

1108
00:54:43,658 --> 00:54:45,410
But instead of walking,

1109
00:54:45,452 --> 00:54:48,621
there's something I've been
wanting to do since I got here,

1110
00:54:48,663 --> 00:54:51,166
and now would be the
perfect opportunity.

1111
00:54:52,417 --> 00:54:55,170
(upbeat music)

1112
00:55:05,055 --> 00:55:08,683
- Henry, careful, you're
being such a tourist.

1113
00:55:08,725 --> 00:55:10,894
- I basically am a tourist.

1114
00:55:10,935 --> 00:55:12,854
Come on, join me, live a little.

1115
00:55:12,896 --> 00:55:14,773
- Sir, sit down please.

1116
00:55:14,814 --> 00:55:17,025
- Henry, you're gonna
get us kicked off.

1117
00:55:17,067 --> 00:55:18,985
- Don't tell me you've
lived here all your life

1118
00:55:19,027 --> 00:55:21,488
and you've never hung off
the side of a cable car?

1119
00:55:21,529 --> 00:55:23,948
- I definitely have not.

1120
00:55:23,990 --> 00:55:25,617
- I'm gonna tell you
this is a friend,

1121
00:55:25,658 --> 00:55:26,951
I think your brother's right,

1122
00:55:26,993 --> 00:55:28,536
you need to stop
worrying so much about

1123
00:55:28,578 --> 00:55:29,788
what other people think of you.

1124
00:55:29,829 --> 00:55:31,289
- Okay, friend.

1125
00:55:31,331 --> 00:55:33,875
But I think that there's
a difference between that

1126
00:55:33,917 --> 00:55:36,586
and acting like a civilized
member of society.

1127
00:55:36,628 --> 00:55:37,837
And please don't
side with Andrew.

1128
00:55:37,879 --> 00:55:40,382
- I don't know, I
think he's got a point.

1129
00:55:40,423 --> 00:55:43,301
Of course, if you
wanna prove me wrong.

1130
00:55:43,343 --> 00:55:46,096
(upbeat music)

1131
00:55:48,848 --> 00:55:51,851
- Merry Christmas San Francisco.

1132
00:55:53,728 --> 00:55:55,980
- Merry Christmas San Francisco.

1133
00:55:59,317 --> 00:56:02,696
- You two hooligans are
off at the next stop.

1134
00:56:02,737 --> 00:56:03,988
- Hooligans.

1135
00:56:06,950 --> 00:56:10,078
Henry, where did the bag go?

1136
00:56:10,120 --> 00:56:12,539
Excuse me, have you
seen where our bag went?

1137
00:56:12,580 --> 00:56:14,374
Did anyone know
where our bag went?

1138
00:56:16,584 --> 00:56:19,337
(gentle music)

1139
00:56:30,890 --> 00:56:33,643
(somber music)

1140
00:56:41,067 --> 00:56:44,654
(somber music continues)

1141
00:56:46,364 --> 00:56:49,701
Must have searched a 10
block radius and nothing.

1142
00:56:49,743 --> 00:56:50,869
What am I gonna do?

1143
00:56:50,910 --> 00:56:52,662
My parents are gonna kill me.

1144
00:57:02,547 --> 00:57:04,090
- Oh perfect timing.

1145
00:57:04,132 --> 00:57:06,634
Henry, I hope you
brought your appetite.

1146
00:57:10,930 --> 00:57:12,015
What's wrong?

1147
00:57:14,517 --> 00:57:16,936
You lost it, all of it.

1148
00:57:16,978 --> 00:57:18,897
- That's bad, even for you.

1149
00:57:18,938 --> 00:57:20,565
- How are we supposed
to tell everyone that

1150
00:57:20,607 --> 00:57:21,900
we lost all their money?

1151
00:57:21,941 --> 00:57:24,986
- Mr. and Mrs. Chang,
this is really my fault.

1152
00:57:25,028 --> 00:57:26,488
We both took turns
carrying the bag,

1153
00:57:26,529 --> 00:57:29,032
but I should have made
sure we still had it.

1154
00:57:29,074 --> 00:57:30,909
- I knew we shouldn't
let her do it.

1155
00:57:30,950 --> 00:57:32,410
It's our tradition, Ivy.

1156
00:57:32,452 --> 00:57:35,288
- I thought it would be
nice to pass this on to Liv,

1157
00:57:35,330 --> 00:57:37,707
to get her to reconnect
to the party again.

1158
00:57:38,792 --> 00:57:40,585
- Why are you always
trying to force me

1159
00:57:40,627 --> 00:57:42,170
to be a part of all of this?

1160
00:57:42,212 --> 00:57:43,880
You know I don't like being
the center of attention

1161
00:57:43,922 --> 00:57:46,383
like you do, that's
why I take the photos.

1162
00:57:46,424 --> 00:57:49,135
- You don't need you to be
the center of attention,

1163
00:57:49,177 --> 00:57:52,555
we need you to be a part of
this family for Christmas.

1164
00:57:52,597 --> 00:57:55,892
We want you to care just
a little about the party,

1165
00:57:55,934 --> 00:57:57,143
about this family.

1166
00:57:57,185 --> 00:57:58,436
If you did, maybe this
wouldn't have happened.

1167
00:57:58,478 --> 00:57:59,813
- Care?

1168
00:57:59,854 --> 00:58:02,691
I think the problem is
I've always cared too much.

1169
00:58:02,732 --> 00:58:05,944
I don't want this family to
be a target for ridicule.

1170
00:58:05,985 --> 00:58:08,113
That's why I had to
set some boundaries.

1171
00:58:08,154 --> 00:58:10,407
- You can't get mad at us
for trusting you to handle

1172
00:58:10,448 --> 00:58:11,574
something so simple.

1173
00:58:11,616 --> 00:58:15,203
- Simple, this is
anything but simple.

1174
00:58:15,245 --> 00:58:17,414
Why do we have to display
envelopes on a tree

1175
00:58:17,455 --> 00:58:19,040
for everyone to see?

1176
00:58:19,082 --> 00:58:21,334
You always make
everything this big show,

1177
00:58:21,376 --> 00:58:24,087
and you expect me to
be someone I'm not.

1178
00:58:24,129 --> 00:58:27,257
This party is a circus,
and it's embarrassing.

1179
00:58:32,554 --> 00:58:35,515
- I didn't realize we were
such an embarrassment.

1180
00:58:35,557 --> 00:58:36,725
- Mom, I didn't...

1181
00:58:36,766 --> 00:58:40,395
- No, ah, no, I understand now.

1182
00:58:41,688 --> 00:58:43,523
My daughter's ashamed of us.

1183
00:58:45,358 --> 00:58:47,277
Your father and I
will handle this.

1184
00:58:47,318 --> 00:58:48,862
We'll apologize to
everyone at the party,

1185
00:58:48,903 --> 00:58:51,364
we'll tell them that
we lost the money.

1186
00:58:52,282 --> 00:58:54,325
Don't worry about saving face,

1187
00:58:55,201 --> 00:58:58,705
in fact, it'll be best
if you didn't come.

1188
00:58:58,747 --> 00:59:01,416
(gentle music)

1189
00:59:19,142 --> 00:59:21,895
(phone ringing)

1190
00:59:25,148 --> 00:59:25,982
- Hi.

1191
00:59:26,024 --> 00:59:27,108
- Good morning.

1192
00:59:27,150 --> 00:59:29,527
I wanted to see
how you're doing.

1193
00:59:29,569 --> 00:59:31,363
- I'm taking a
mental health day.

1194
00:59:31,404 --> 00:59:36,242
- I hate to bother you, but we
still have a story to submit.

1195
00:59:36,284 --> 00:59:37,619
It's a tight deadline.

1196
00:59:37,660 --> 00:59:39,996
- Henry, I can't be a part
of this story anymore.

1197
00:59:40,038 --> 00:59:41,164
- Liv.

1198
00:59:41,206 --> 00:59:43,124
- I'm serious, I've
ruined everything.

1199
00:59:44,042 --> 00:59:46,294
My parents don't even
want me at the party

1200
00:59:46,336 --> 00:59:49,089
and I don't blame them.

1201
00:59:49,964 --> 00:59:54,052
So for now, I need
some time alone, okay.

1202
00:59:54,094 --> 00:59:55,595
- Okay.

1203
00:59:55,637 --> 00:59:58,598
- I took some great photos,
so just choose your favorites.

1204
01:00:01,142 --> 01:00:03,853
(gentle music)

1205
01:00:06,773 --> 01:00:08,983
- Thank you for agreeing
to talk with me again,

1206
01:00:09,025 --> 01:00:11,736
I know it's not the best
timing after last night.

1207
01:00:11,778 --> 01:00:13,279
- We're sorry you
had to see that.

1208
01:00:13,321 --> 01:00:16,866
- We appreciate you caring
about our story so much.

1209
01:00:16,908 --> 01:00:18,785
Hopefully we're still
front page worthy.

1210
01:00:18,827 --> 01:00:20,412
- There's a really
special story here,

1211
01:00:20,453 --> 01:00:23,331
I just wanna make
sure I get it right.

1212
01:00:23,373 --> 01:00:25,166
Is it okay if I set up a camera

1213
01:00:25,208 --> 01:00:26,918
to make sure I get everything?

1214
01:00:26,960 --> 01:00:28,211
- Of course.

1215
01:00:28,253 --> 01:00:30,255
(upbeat music)

1216
01:00:30,296 --> 01:00:34,050
Well, I hope you're ready to
get your hands dirty again.

1217
01:00:34,092 --> 01:00:35,552
- You know it.

1218
01:00:35,593 --> 01:00:39,055
Oh, and before I forget, I
got something for you too.

1219
01:00:39,973 --> 01:00:42,267
- Oh, you didn't have
to get us anything.

1220
01:00:42,308 --> 01:00:44,477
- Ah, just a little thank you.

1221
01:00:44,519 --> 01:00:46,021
- Oh, I love it.

1222
01:00:48,106 --> 01:00:49,149
- Thank you.

1223
01:00:53,194 --> 01:00:55,363
- All right, well let's
start putting together

1224
01:00:55,405 --> 01:00:56,614
some goody bags.

1225
01:00:56,656 --> 01:00:58,199
- Okay, there's a whole
system here, Henry,

1226
01:00:58,241 --> 01:00:59,784
so follow along closely.

1227
01:00:59,826 --> 01:01:02,579
First off, we have
these little jars of

1228
01:01:02,620 --> 01:01:04,581
Liv's special hot chocolate.

1229
01:01:04,622 --> 01:01:06,499
And despite what
happened last night,

1230
01:01:06,541 --> 01:01:08,126
I have to admit it's delicious.

1231
01:01:08,168 --> 01:01:09,419
So into the bag it goes.

1232
01:01:10,462 --> 01:01:15,717
Next, we have peppermint
tea, some candy,

1233
01:01:17,135 --> 01:01:22,349
and Liz's special
Christmas fortune cookies.

1234
01:01:26,269 --> 01:01:28,188
- Liv's done a lot this year.

1235
01:01:28,229 --> 01:01:30,231
- I know she acts like
she's too sophisticated

1236
01:01:30,273 --> 01:01:34,194
for our party, but she
does have a good heart.

1237
01:01:34,235 --> 01:01:35,820
- Maybe it's because
we're her parents,

1238
01:01:35,862 --> 01:01:38,907
but we always want everyone
to know how amazing she is.

1239
01:01:38,948 --> 01:01:40,992
- Even when we're mad at her.

1240
01:01:41,034 --> 01:01:43,787
(upbeat music)

1241
01:01:51,419 --> 01:01:53,338
* Father Christmas *

1242
01:01:53,380 --> 01:01:57,509
* I'm writing to you
for forgiveness *

1243
01:01:57,550 --> 01:02:01,429
* Walking alone
in the stillness *

1244
01:02:01,471 --> 01:02:04,557
* Wishing it wasn't this way *

1245
01:02:04,599 --> 01:02:06,935
* On this holiday *

1246
01:02:06,976 --> 01:02:09,062
* Snow is falling *

1247
01:02:09,104 --> 01:02:13,233
* Won't you put hope
in the stocking *

1248
01:02:13,274 --> 01:02:17,195
* I'll take some
joy if you got it *

1249
01:02:17,237 --> 01:02:20,448
* Is there something
for this pain *

1250
01:02:20,490 --> 01:02:24,202
* Packed up in your sleigh *

1251
01:02:26,371 --> 01:02:27,831
- Welcome back.

1252
01:02:29,290 --> 01:02:30,375
- You remember me?

1253
01:02:30,417 --> 01:02:32,210
- Of course.

1254
01:02:32,252 --> 01:02:36,131
You came in with that
tall, handsome man.

1255
01:02:36,172 --> 01:02:37,215
How are you?

1256
01:02:38,883 --> 01:02:41,136
- Honestly not great.

1257
01:02:42,178 --> 01:02:44,848
I kind of ruined
Christmas for my family,

1258
01:02:45,974 --> 01:02:48,351
an entire
neighborhood, actually.

1259
01:02:48,393 --> 01:02:50,228
- I'm sure it's not that bad.

1260
01:02:50,270 --> 01:02:52,272
- Oh no, it is.

1261
01:02:53,565 --> 01:02:55,400
I didn't just ruin a party.

1262
01:02:56,276 --> 01:02:58,069
I lost thousands
of dollars intended

1263
01:02:58,111 --> 01:03:00,113
for the kids in
our neighborhood.

1264
01:03:00,989 --> 01:03:02,741
I called my parents
an embarrassment,

1265
01:03:02,782 --> 01:03:04,951
even though the entire
community loves them.

1266
01:03:04,993 --> 01:03:08,038
And now they're gonna let
everybody down because of me.

1267
01:03:09,414 --> 01:03:10,582
And that tall, handsome man,

1268
01:03:10,623 --> 01:03:13,668
well, I basically abandoned him

1269
01:03:13,710 --> 01:03:16,004
while he tries to
pick up the pieces

1270
01:03:16,046 --> 01:03:18,048
of the disaster I've caused.

1271
01:03:18,798 --> 01:03:20,467
- Oh, I see.

1272
01:03:22,510 --> 01:03:23,428
May I?

1273
01:03:28,308 --> 01:03:32,979
This party would it happen to
be the big Christmas soirée

1274
01:03:33,021 --> 01:03:35,398
that happens a few
blocks from here?

1275
01:03:35,440 --> 01:03:36,900
- You know about it?

1276
01:03:36,941 --> 01:03:39,110
- Well, I'm usually in the
cathedral when it happens,

1277
01:03:39,152 --> 01:03:42,947
but I hear it's a real joy.

1278
01:03:44,199 --> 01:03:47,994
It's strange how a time of year
so filled with joy and hope

1279
01:03:48,036 --> 01:03:51,206
can also be the
cause of heartache.

1280
01:03:52,707 --> 01:03:54,709
In the grand scheme of things,

1281
01:03:54,751 --> 01:03:58,421
I believe Christmas
symbolizes a time

1282
01:03:58,463 --> 01:04:01,257
of communities coming together

1283
01:04:01,299 --> 01:04:06,346
and refuge for those who
need it, even when it's dark.

1284
01:04:08,556 --> 01:04:09,974
Follow me dear.

1285
01:04:15,271 --> 01:04:19,234
Fortunately, darkness
is easy to drive away.

1286
01:04:19,275 --> 01:04:22,862
Sometimes we just need a
little help from our neighbors.

1287
01:04:23,822 --> 01:04:28,159
That's why sharing our
light is so important.

1288
01:04:28,201 --> 01:04:31,621
You never know who else
around you might need it.

1289
01:04:35,041 --> 01:04:36,334
- Are you an angel?

1290
01:04:36,376 --> 01:04:40,630
- Oh no, I've just
lived a long life,

1291
01:04:40,672 --> 01:04:42,632
but I am a neighbor
if you need one.

1292
01:04:44,384 --> 01:04:45,677
- Thanks.

1293
01:04:45,719 --> 01:04:48,388
(gentle music)

1294
01:04:57,439 --> 01:05:00,984
(gentle music continues)

1295
01:05:07,365 --> 01:05:10,910
(gentle music continues)

1296
01:05:34,517 --> 01:05:37,520
- We got these made special
for the 25th anniversary.

1297
01:05:38,188 --> 01:05:39,439
- Hey, stuff and talk you guys,

1298
01:05:39,481 --> 01:05:41,232
I'm not gonna fill
all these bags myself.

1299
01:05:41,274 --> 01:05:43,443
- This is from the
20th anniversary,

1300
01:05:43,485 --> 01:05:45,278
the year Santa showed it
up to help me hand out

1301
01:05:45,320 --> 01:05:46,821
my sesame candy canes,

1302
01:05:47,781 --> 01:05:49,449
didn't go over so well.

1303
01:05:49,491 --> 01:05:50,617
- I am curious though,

1304
01:05:50,658 --> 01:05:53,078
why infuse all the
Chinese elements

1305
01:05:53,119 --> 01:05:54,496
into your Christmas party?

1306
01:05:54,537 --> 01:05:57,123
- Chinese and Christmas
traditions just go together.

1307
01:05:57,165 --> 01:05:59,584
I mean, red and green
are lucky colors,

1308
01:05:59,626 --> 01:06:01,878
so our decorations were
already made for Christmas.

1309
01:06:01,920 --> 01:06:04,589
- Jack and I just wanted to
reconnect with our roots,

1310
01:06:04,631 --> 01:06:05,465
you know,

1311
01:06:05,507 --> 01:06:08,760
and share that Asian family joy

1312
01:06:08,802 --> 01:06:11,638
with our children
and our community.

1313
01:06:11,680 --> 01:06:14,432
- It's also why we used to
have Liv sing at the party.

1314
01:06:14,474 --> 01:06:17,310
We wanted her to feel
proud of her heritage

1315
01:06:17,352 --> 01:06:19,938
and feel the love and
strength for the community

1316
01:06:19,979 --> 01:06:21,523
that loves her.

1317
01:06:22,649 --> 01:06:24,734
You should have seen how moved
the Chinese families were

1318
01:06:24,776 --> 01:06:27,404
when they saw a little
Liv in their cheongsam,

1319
01:06:27,445 --> 01:06:30,448
singing a Christmas
tune in Cantonese.

1320
01:06:30,490 --> 01:06:33,368
They loved it,
everybody loved it.

1321
01:06:34,494 --> 01:06:37,038
- Yeah, I know, we can
be a little over the top.

1322
01:06:38,164 --> 01:06:40,375
Okay, a lot over the top.

1323
01:06:40,417 --> 01:06:42,335
- We just like to put our
own spin on everything,

1324
01:06:42,377 --> 01:06:44,713
but that's what being
Chinese American is.

1325
01:06:44,754 --> 01:06:48,925
It's the best of both
worlds and a hot pot mess.

1326
01:06:48,967 --> 01:06:51,636
(upbeat music)

1327
01:06:59,894 --> 01:07:03,481
(upbeat music continues)

1328
01:07:04,441 --> 01:07:08,778
- Merry Christmas to you.

1329
01:07:08,820 --> 01:07:10,113
Merry Christmas.

1330
01:07:17,370 --> 01:07:18,913
- Writer's block?

1331
01:07:19,831 --> 01:07:23,585
- Welcome back, how was
your mental health day?

1332
01:07:23,626 --> 01:07:26,880
- Very productive actually,

1333
01:07:26,921 --> 01:07:29,424
thank you for sending
me the interview,

1334
01:07:29,466 --> 01:07:31,801
it was exactly what
I needed to hear.

1335
01:07:32,844 --> 01:07:33,678
- I'm glad.

1336
01:07:33,720 --> 01:07:35,013
- I think I was so caught up in

1337
01:07:35,055 --> 01:07:36,890
how the party was affecting
me all these years,

1338
01:07:36,931 --> 01:07:40,810
I completely lost sight
of the incredible people

1339
01:07:40,852 --> 01:07:41,686
who put it on.

1340
01:07:41,728 --> 01:07:43,813
- They really are something.

1341
01:07:45,940 --> 01:07:49,444
- I wanna apologize for
everything that's happened.

1342
01:07:49,486 --> 01:07:53,031
I know I've made a
mess out of things.

1343
01:07:53,073 --> 01:07:56,034
I let my own baggage
almost derail the story.

1344
01:07:56,076 --> 01:07:59,412
I hid the truth of who I am
from you and from Charles,

1345
01:07:59,454 --> 01:08:02,040
which could have scrapped
your first assignment.

1346
01:08:03,792 --> 01:08:05,960
I'm done running
from that person now.

1347
01:08:07,337 --> 01:08:08,713
- I'm happy to hear it.

1348
01:08:11,257 --> 01:08:15,595
- And I think I know a way
to raise back the donations

1349
01:08:15,637 --> 01:08:17,097
I lost.

1350
01:08:17,138 --> 01:08:17,972
- You do?

1351
01:08:18,014 --> 01:08:18,973
What do you have in mind?

1352
01:08:20,350 --> 01:08:23,395
- Let's consult an expert first.

1353
01:08:23,436 --> 01:08:26,189
(upbeat music)

1354
01:08:30,819 --> 01:08:31,986
There he is.

1355
01:08:34,072 --> 01:08:35,740
- This is your expert?

1356
01:08:37,909 --> 01:08:41,162
- An expert in
being Changtastic.

1357
01:08:43,331 --> 01:08:44,624
- What up least favorite child?

1358
01:08:44,666 --> 01:08:46,501
- Oh, I'm glad to see you too.

1359
01:08:48,378 --> 01:08:49,838
- Henry.
- Hey.

1360
01:08:54,050 --> 01:08:55,385
- So what's up?

1361
01:08:55,427 --> 01:08:58,805
- I wanted to tell you
that you were both right.

1362
01:08:58,847 --> 01:09:01,349
I spend way too much
time caring about

1363
01:09:01,391 --> 01:09:02,350
what other people think.

1364
01:09:02,392 --> 01:09:03,518
- Called it.

1365
01:09:04,394 --> 01:09:06,229
- And you both
deserve the full truth

1366
01:09:06,271 --> 01:09:11,026
as to why I run from Liv Chang
and became just Liv Rose.

1367
01:09:11,067 --> 01:09:13,069
- Wow, this is serious.

1368
01:09:13,111 --> 01:09:15,280
- This whole mess
started in seventh grade,

1369
01:09:15,321 --> 01:09:17,157
the last year I
sang at the party,

1370
01:09:18,241 --> 01:09:21,911
and it turned out to be the
most embarrassing moment

1371
01:09:21,953 --> 01:09:23,204
in my life.

1372
01:09:24,039 --> 01:09:25,915
I actually liked
singing for everyone,

1373
01:09:25,957 --> 01:09:30,128
and I loved the red
cheongsam grandma bought me,

1374
01:09:30,170 --> 01:09:32,339
I was so excited to show it off.

1375
01:09:32,380 --> 01:09:35,383
So I invited a few
girls from my class.

1376
01:09:36,468 --> 01:09:41,723
They recorded me and sent it
out to everyone at school.

1377
01:09:43,433 --> 01:09:44,684
So for the rest of junior high,

1378
01:09:44,726 --> 01:09:45,852
all the kids would
make fun of me,

1379
01:09:45,894 --> 01:09:48,605
singing to me in
a Chinese accent.

1380
01:09:48,646 --> 01:09:51,358
- Liv, that's awful.

1381
01:09:51,399 --> 01:09:52,859
- Looking back,

1382
01:09:52,901 --> 01:09:55,403
I wish I didn't give into
a bunch of basic bullies,

1383
01:09:55,445 --> 01:09:58,073
but after that, I wasn't
really myself anymore.

1384
01:09:58,907 --> 01:10:00,325
I was trying to blend in,

1385
01:10:00,367 --> 01:10:03,203
but also feeling guilty for
trying to distance myself

1386
01:10:03,244 --> 01:10:04,746
from everything Chinese.

1387
01:10:04,788 --> 01:10:09,793
I'm really not embarrassed of
our family or of the party,

1388
01:10:11,419 --> 01:10:13,296
I'm embarrassed of myself,

1389
01:10:16,216 --> 01:10:19,886
but I'm not even sure if I
know who myself is anymore.

1390
01:10:20,929 --> 01:10:22,555
- You know you don't have
to be one thing or another.

1391
01:10:22,597 --> 01:10:24,474
You can be everything you are,

1392
01:10:24,516 --> 01:10:28,103
artist, amateur baker,
annoying sister.

1393
01:10:28,728 --> 01:10:29,854
You know what it helps me out,

1394
01:10:29,896 --> 01:10:31,815
knowing that hater's gonna hate,

1395
01:10:31,856 --> 01:10:35,944
but you, mom and dad always
got my back, no matter what.

1396
01:10:35,985 --> 01:10:39,989
- Thank you for having
my back, both of you.

1397
01:10:40,031 --> 01:10:42,701
(gentle music)

1398
01:10:44,953 --> 01:10:47,914
- I think other people
should hear this.

1399
01:10:49,040 --> 01:10:51,710
I'm sure you're not the only
one who has felt this way.

1400
01:10:51,751 --> 01:10:54,671
- Well, that's why I
brought you both here today.

1401
01:10:54,713 --> 01:10:58,258
It's time to show everyone
who I am, all of me.

1402
01:10:59,426 --> 01:11:02,637
I just hope they still like
me once they get to know me.

1403
01:11:03,304 --> 01:11:04,347
- They'll love you.

1404
01:11:05,849 --> 01:11:08,643
- Yeah, just be yourself,
but you know, less weird.

1405
01:11:11,312 --> 01:11:12,230
- Okay.

1406
01:11:17,485 --> 01:11:19,779
- Hi everyone, I'm
coming to you live

1407
01:11:19,821 --> 01:11:21,531
because there's
something important

1408
01:11:21,573 --> 01:11:23,408
I have to get off my chest.

1409
01:11:24,701 --> 01:11:27,454
Most of you know me as Liv
Rose, the photographer.

1410
01:11:27,495 --> 01:11:31,124
But there's a part of me I've
avoided for a very long time.

1411
01:11:32,042 --> 01:11:37,297
My name, my full name
is Liv Rose Chang.

1412
01:11:38,757 --> 01:11:42,010
And my family and my
community need your help.

1413
01:11:43,094 --> 01:11:46,056
(triumphant music)

1414
01:11:51,853 --> 01:11:54,481
(upbeat music)

1415
01:12:01,696 --> 01:12:05,241
(upbeat music continues)

1416
01:12:06,409 --> 01:12:08,244
- Whoa, this sweater
costs 90 bucks.

1417
01:12:08,286 --> 01:12:10,455
- Why is there a money
tree in the backyard?

1418
01:12:10,497 --> 01:12:11,873
I thought with
everything that happened,

1419
01:12:11,915 --> 01:12:13,083
we weren't gonna have one.

1420
01:12:13,124 --> 01:12:15,001
- Relax, there's no
money in the envelopes.

1421
01:12:15,043 --> 01:12:16,586
- Then why did you do that?

1422
01:12:17,879 --> 01:12:19,839
Any minute now I'm gonna
have to go out there

1423
01:12:19,881 --> 01:12:21,925
and tell everyone that
there is no money.

1424
01:12:21,966 --> 01:12:23,510
The tree will still
be nice to look at.

1425
01:12:23,551 --> 01:12:24,719
- It's okay, son,

1426
01:12:24,761 --> 01:12:26,596
your mom's just a little
high strung tonight.

1427
01:12:27,555 --> 01:12:30,141
You haven't heard from
your sister, have you?

1428
01:12:30,183 --> 01:12:31,768
- I thought you told
her not to come.

1429
01:12:31,810 --> 01:12:35,230
- We did, but that doesn't
mean we don't want her here.

1430
01:12:36,981 --> 01:12:39,067
- Thank you, thank you.
- Welcome.

1431
01:12:48,159 --> 01:12:49,327
- Hi.
- Where are you guys?

1432
01:12:49,369 --> 01:12:50,537
- Mom and dad are flipping out.

1433
01:12:50,578 --> 01:12:52,831
We're almost there,
is everything ready?

1434
01:12:52,872 --> 01:12:55,250
- I'm just waiting on you.

1435
01:13:04,634 --> 01:13:08,346
- Hope you're ready for a
party you'll never forget.

1436
01:13:08,388 --> 01:13:11,141
(upbeat music)

1437
01:13:17,939 --> 01:13:21,568
(upbeat music continues)

1438
01:13:28,783 --> 01:13:30,160
- Whoa.

1439
01:13:30,201 --> 01:13:32,787
- Yeah, that's the right word.

1440
01:13:32,829 --> 01:13:35,582
(upbeat music)

1441
01:13:42,797 --> 01:13:46,343
(upbeat music continues)

1442
01:13:52,724 --> 01:13:56,311
(upbeat music continues)

1443
01:14:02,108 --> 01:14:05,737
(upbeat music continues)

1444
01:14:07,864 --> 01:14:08,740
- It's about to
pop off any second,

1445
01:14:08,782 --> 01:14:10,200
you really cut it close.

1446
01:14:11,201 --> 01:14:13,244
- What can I say? I'm a Chang,

1447
01:14:13,286 --> 01:14:15,205
I have a flare for the dramatic.

1448
01:14:17,040 --> 01:14:20,335
- Thank you everyone for
joining us here tonight

1449
01:14:20,377 --> 01:14:22,295
to celebrate the
25th anniversary

1450
01:14:22,337 --> 01:14:24,756
of the Changtastic
Christmas party.

1451
01:14:24,798 --> 01:14:27,634
(crowd applauds)

1452
01:14:31,971 --> 01:14:34,766
- We wanna start
by thanking you all

1453
01:14:34,808 --> 01:14:36,476
for your incredible help,

1454
01:14:36,518 --> 01:14:38,770
it wouldn't have been
possible for this party

1455
01:14:38,812 --> 01:14:43,483
to have grown and
endured without each
and every one of you.

1456
01:14:48,029 --> 01:14:52,867
- This year we have some
news we need to share.

1457
01:14:52,909 --> 01:14:54,661
Normally by this time,

1458
01:14:54,703 --> 01:14:59,040
we would have a tally of all
the donations that we received,

1459
01:14:59,082 --> 01:15:01,459
and we'd be picking
an envelope to see

1460
01:15:01,501 --> 01:15:04,254
which lucky neighbor
gets to announce

1461
01:15:04,295 --> 01:15:07,173
just how much we get to
give back to our community.

1462
01:15:08,383 --> 01:15:13,513
But unfortunately, this
year, that's not the case,

1463
01:15:15,724 --> 01:15:16,975
because the truth is...

1464
01:15:17,017 --> 01:15:18,309
- I lost the money.

1465
01:15:30,363 --> 01:15:33,867
I'm so, so sorry.

1466
01:15:35,201 --> 01:15:36,703
I was careless.

1467
01:15:36,745 --> 01:15:40,915
And I think it's because
I never truly understood

1468
01:15:40,957 --> 01:15:43,710
just how important
this party is.

1469
01:15:44,836 --> 01:15:47,714
In fact, I was embarrassed
to be associated with it.

1470
01:15:50,383 --> 01:15:52,844
But with the help
of a new friend

1471
01:15:55,430 --> 01:15:57,682
and the kindness of a neighbor,

1472
01:15:57,724 --> 01:16:02,520
I finally realized that this
party is more than just my

1473
01:16:02,562 --> 01:16:06,358
parents' outlandish way
of celebrating Christmas.

1474
01:16:06,399 --> 01:16:08,818
It's their way of bringing
our community together

1475
01:16:08,860 --> 01:16:10,236
to celebrate our friendships

1476
01:16:10,278 --> 01:16:12,864
and remind each other
that we have each other

1477
01:16:12,906 --> 01:16:14,616
to lean on when we need to.

1478
01:16:19,204 --> 01:16:21,998
Many of you have known
me most of my life

1479
01:16:22,040 --> 01:16:25,669
and have supported our family
through our ups and downs.

1480
01:16:25,710 --> 01:16:28,755
And I know my parents have
done the same for you too.

1481
01:16:29,839 --> 01:16:31,383
And that's something special

1482
01:16:33,051 --> 01:16:35,553
I want to make up
for what I lost

1483
01:16:35,595 --> 01:16:38,348
and all those years
I spent hiding

1484
01:16:38,390 --> 01:16:43,603
from this big, absurd,
over the top, fun, joyous,

1485
01:16:44,688 --> 01:16:47,649
magical celebration of
the best time of the year.

1486
01:16:48,733 --> 01:16:50,985
I did have to ask
for some help though.

1487
01:16:52,070 --> 01:16:53,738
So I wanna thank
all of my followers

1488
01:16:53,780 --> 01:16:58,993
who watched and reshared my
video and donated generously.

1489
01:16:59,911 --> 01:17:04,040
They made up all of your
donations and then some.

1490
01:17:05,959 --> 01:17:08,795
- Hang on, excuse me, hang on.

1491
01:17:10,296 --> 01:17:13,675
Hi, I found your money.

1492
01:17:13,717 --> 01:17:15,135
- You what?

1493
01:17:15,176 --> 01:17:16,636
- My friends and I saw it
fall off the cable car.

1494
01:17:16,678 --> 01:17:19,973
But by the time we caught
up to you, you were gone.

1495
01:17:20,015 --> 01:17:21,224
I saw your video online,

1496
01:17:21,266 --> 01:17:23,435
so I finally figured out
how to get it to you.

1497
01:17:23,476 --> 01:17:25,270
- I can't believe this, what?

1498
01:17:25,311 --> 01:17:27,147
Thank you, what's your Name?

1499
01:17:27,188 --> 01:17:28,773
- Nora.

1500
01:17:28,815 --> 01:17:29,941
- Thank you Nora.

1501
01:17:29,983 --> 01:17:33,069
(everyone applauds)

1502
01:17:37,991 --> 01:17:39,367
Thank you.

1503
01:17:39,409 --> 01:17:40,827
- Merry Christmas.

1504
01:17:40,869 --> 01:17:42,037
- Merry Christmas.

1505
01:17:45,373 --> 01:17:47,917
- Does this mean there's
twice as many donations

1506
01:17:47,959 --> 01:17:49,586
as there usually are.

1507
01:17:49,627 --> 01:17:50,545
- And more.

1508
01:17:56,176 --> 01:17:58,094
I have one more
surprise for you.

1509
01:18:20,116 --> 01:18:24,037
(singing in foreign language)

1510
01:18:30,585 --> 01:18:35,590
(singing in foreign
language continues)

1511
01:18:41,221 --> 01:18:46,017
(singing in foreign
language continues)

1512
01:18:51,898 --> 01:18:56,903
(singing in foreign
language continues)

1513
01:19:01,991 --> 01:19:06,913
(singing in foreign
language continues)

1514
01:19:12,544 --> 01:19:17,424
(singing in foreign
language continues)

1515
01:19:22,929 --> 01:19:27,892
(singing in foreign
language continues)

1516
01:19:33,273 --> 01:19:38,069
(singing in foreign
language continues)

1517
01:19:43,366 --> 01:19:48,121
(singing in foreign
language continues)

1518
01:19:56,880 --> 01:19:59,966
(everyone applauds)

1519
01:20:02,302 --> 01:20:04,095
- That's my daughter

1520
01:20:08,099 --> 01:20:09,893
Liv, that was...

1521
01:20:09,934 --> 01:20:10,810
- Incredible.

1522
01:20:12,604 --> 01:20:17,150
- Mom, dad, I'm so sorry
I've been so selfish

1523
01:20:17,192 --> 01:20:18,360
all these years.

1524
01:20:18,401 --> 01:20:19,444
- We're just happy
to have you back

1525
01:20:19,486 --> 01:20:21,613
in the Chang fold sweetheart.

1526
01:20:21,654 --> 01:20:23,573
- I'm speechless,

1527
01:20:23,615 --> 01:20:26,868
I don't think that's ever
happened to me before.

1528
01:20:32,207 --> 01:20:33,667
- He's a good one, isn't he?

1529
01:20:33,708 --> 01:20:34,834
- He is.

1530
01:20:34,876 --> 01:20:37,253
And you'd be very
stupid to let him go.

1531
01:20:38,254 --> 01:20:39,339
- Mom.

1532
01:20:39,381 --> 01:20:40,757
- If it helps,
pretend we hate him,

1533
01:20:40,799 --> 01:20:42,676
it'll be an act of rebellion.

1534
01:20:43,718 --> 01:20:47,847
- Well, I think it's time
I start taking your advice.

1535
01:20:48,807 --> 01:20:51,559
I clearly have a lot
to learn from you two.

1536
01:21:01,528 --> 01:21:03,655
- That seems like it
went over pretty well.

1537
01:21:03,697 --> 01:21:07,492
- I think we're finally starting
to understand each other.

1538
01:21:07,534 --> 01:21:11,663
And I also think you
and I make a great team,

1539
01:21:12,831 --> 01:21:16,209
and I would love to cover
more stories together.

1540
01:21:16,251 --> 01:21:17,168
- I'd like that.

1541
01:21:18,378 --> 01:21:21,006
And I hope we can keep
being friends too.

1542
01:21:21,047 --> 01:21:22,841
That is, if you're
okay with blending

1543
01:21:22,882 --> 01:21:25,593
your personal and
professional lives a little.

1544
01:21:27,178 --> 01:21:29,222
- I wanna be more than friends.

1545
01:21:29,264 --> 01:21:32,017
(upbeat music)

1546
01:21:38,648 --> 01:21:42,193
(upbeat music continues)

1547
01:21:47,282 --> 01:21:49,325
- So you ready to celebrate?

1548
01:21:52,287 --> 01:21:54,247
- I almost forgot something.

1549
01:21:54,289 --> 01:21:56,499
* Oh, oh, oh *

1550
01:21:56,541 --> 01:21:59,210
(upbeat music)

1551
01:22:03,798 --> 01:22:05,133
- Say grandchildren.

1552
01:22:05,175 --> 01:22:08,678
(upbeat music continues)

1553
01:22:16,353 --> 01:22:19,939
(upbeat music continues)

1554
01:22:26,780 --> 01:22:30,617
(upbeat music continues)

1555
01:22:33,495 --> 01:22:34,913
- It's perfect,

1556
01:22:34,954 --> 01:22:37,749
that Liv Chang is a
pretty good photographer.

1557
01:22:40,543 --> 01:22:43,004
- Come on, I have
a gift for you.

1558
01:22:43,963 --> 01:22:44,839
- Oh.

1559
01:22:46,216 --> 01:22:48,885
(gentle music)

1560
01:23:01,648 --> 01:23:03,108
- Don't tell my mom,

1561
01:23:03,149 --> 01:23:06,027
or she'll think she's the
