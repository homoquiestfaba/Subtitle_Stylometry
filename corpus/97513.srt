1
00:00:41,959 --> 00:00:46,588
November 1958,
my senior year of high school.

2
00:00:46,630 --> 00:00:48,715
While other girls
were dancing to Elvis...

3
00:00:48,757 --> 00:00:50,300
and dreaming about prom dates...

4
00:00:50,342 --> 00:00:53,595
I was reading Jane Austen
and dreaming about college.

5
00:00:53,637 --> 00:00:55,305
And then my parents announced...

6
00:00:55,347 --> 00:00:57,683
we were moving to Cuba--
in a week.

7
00:01:09,027 --> 00:01:11,154
Slamming doors and
giving the silent treatment...

8
00:01:11,196 --> 00:01:12,614
couldn't change that...

9
00:01:12,656 --> 00:01:15,242
but it was easier than admitting
I was really scared.

10
00:01:15,284 --> 00:01:17,077
At least everyone else
was happy.

11
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:19,246
Dad got his big promotion
from Ford.

12
00:01:19,288 --> 00:01:21,748
Mom got to travel in style,
and Susie...

13
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:25,544
I swear that girl
could adjust in a hurricane.

14
00:02:29,107 --> 00:02:31,109
Welcome to the Hotel Oceana.

15
00:02:54,383 --> 00:02:56,593
Not too shabby, huh?

16
00:02:58,303 --> 00:02:59,888
Here's what I know about Cuba--

17
00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:02,474
my high-school French
wasn't going to help me.

18
00:03:02,516 --> 00:03:04,309
I didn't know a single person...

19
00:03:04,351 --> 00:03:06,019
and though no one
would talk about it...

20
00:03:06,061 --> 00:03:08,564
Fidel Castro was leading
a people in a revolution...

21
00:03:08,605 --> 00:03:10,732
against President Batista...

22
00:03:10,774 --> 00:03:13,986
not that you would know it
from this place.

23
00:03:16,989 --> 00:03:19,950
This is Cuba.
Nobody cares what you do here.

24
00:03:19,992 --> 00:03:21,493
Susie, you want a smoke?

25
00:03:21,535 --> 00:03:24,079
Watch out for this one.
She's a bad influence.

26
00:03:24,121 --> 00:03:25,831
I'll take that as a compliment.

27
00:03:25,873 --> 00:03:28,584
She'll have you
ditching classes in no time.

28
00:03:28,625 --> 00:03:30,377
As I recall,
there's a certain someone...

29
00:03:30,419 --> 00:03:31,962
that likes to ditch them
with me.

30
00:03:33,422 --> 00:03:36,175
Don't forget to sign up
for mambo lessons.

31
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:38,385
Mambo classes
are held every day...

32
00:03:38,427 --> 00:03:41,305
My God.
June Cleaver is in Havana.

33
00:03:42,723 --> 00:03:46,435
Actually, that's my sister
Katey. She's a real brain.

34
00:03:46,476 --> 00:03:48,187
Oh, really?

35
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:50,397
Yeah. She's probably going
to Radcliffe.

36
00:03:50,439 --> 00:03:52,191
What, majoring in fashion?

37
00:03:55,027 --> 00:03:58,906
Why don't you join us?
There's room here.

38
00:04:05,287 --> 00:04:06,830
I'm James Phelps.

39
00:04:06,872 --> 00:04:08,207
Hi. Katey Miller.

40
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:09,541
Pleasure to meet you.

41
00:04:10,792 --> 00:04:12,085
- Are you the--
- Yeah.

42
00:04:12,127 --> 00:04:15,297
- Your dad works for my dad.
- Yeah.

43
00:04:15,339 --> 00:04:19,176
This is Sheila, Eve,
Polly, and Steph...

44
00:04:19,218 --> 00:04:21,094
and I guess you know Susie,
right?

45
00:04:22,763 --> 00:04:24,097
So, are you really going
to Radcliffe?

46
00:04:24,139 --> 00:04:25,557
I won't know till spring.

47
00:04:25,599 --> 00:04:28,101
Whoa. Watch out, girls.

48
00:04:28,143 --> 00:04:29,811
I guess if your head's
in your books...

49
00:04:29,853 --> 00:04:30,979
you really don't have time...

50
00:04:31,021 --> 00:04:34,900
to think about
silly things like the weather.

51
00:04:34,942 --> 00:04:36,193
Chilly?

52
00:04:37,319 --> 00:04:38,946
Oh.

53
00:04:40,322 --> 00:04:43,200
I'm so sorry. It's my fault.

54
00:04:43,242 --> 00:04:45,994
No, just go get new drinks.

55
00:04:51,458 --> 00:04:52,960
Stupid spic.

56
00:04:56,797 --> 00:04:58,465
Excuse me.

57
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:10,769
- Excuse me. Señor?
- How may I help you, señorita?

58
00:05:10,811 --> 00:05:13,146
I knocked into those drinks.
I'd like to pay for them.

59
00:05:13,188 --> 00:05:16,775
That will not be necessary.
Accidents happen. Excuse me.

60
00:05:21,697 --> 00:05:24,658
I speak English...

61
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:26,994
and I don't need your charity.

62
00:05:27,035 --> 00:05:29,454
It's not.

63
00:05:29,496 --> 00:05:31,456
Don't worry about it. It's OK.

64
00:05:33,709 --> 00:05:35,502
I'm sorry
for what she called you.

65
00:05:35,544 --> 00:05:37,379
- That was nothing.
- Not to me.

66
00:05:37,421 --> 00:05:39,548
Then why are you apologizing?

67
00:05:47,931 --> 00:05:49,683
You guys were so good.

68
00:05:49,725 --> 00:05:54,771
Your mother was good. I was OK.

69
00:05:54,813 --> 00:05:56,732
- Dad?
- Hmm.

70
00:05:56,773 --> 00:06:02,196
I'm sorry I haven't been
excited about all of this.

71
00:06:04,948 --> 00:06:06,283
Sweetheart, it's OK.

72
00:06:06,325 --> 00:06:10,537
Senior year is a terrible time
to drag you out of school...

73
00:06:10,579 --> 00:06:12,331
especially when
you're the star of the class.

74
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:14,583
- Dad.
- Come on. Don't deny it.

75
00:06:14,625 --> 00:06:16,460
Be proud of it.

76
00:06:16,502 --> 00:06:19,922
You'll do great here, too.

77
00:06:33,769 --> 00:06:36,647
I can't stand on your feet
anymore.

78
00:06:42,611 --> 00:06:44,947
- Hey, you remembered that.
- Yeah.

79
00:06:46,323 --> 00:06:48,325
Very good.

80
00:06:51,203 --> 00:06:53,121
Let's continue
where we left off.

81
00:06:53,163 --> 00:06:56,250
Book 18, page 25.

82
00:06:56,291 --> 00:06:58,669
Katey, just do your best
to follow, all right?

83
00:06:58,710 --> 00:07:00,712
It's OK. I read it last year.

84
00:07:01,839 --> 00:07:03,841
Knock it off.

85
00:07:03,882 --> 00:07:07,010
Well, then perhaps you'd like
to begin reading at line 342.

86
00:07:08,846 --> 00:07:12,099
"Now the suitors
turned to dance and song...

87
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:14,268
"to the lovely beaten sway...

88
00:07:14,309 --> 00:07:17,813
"waiting for dusk
to come upon them there...

89
00:07:17,855 --> 00:07:22,317
and the dark night came
upon them, lost in pleasure."

90
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:27,489
Can anyone tell us...

91
00:07:27,531 --> 00:07:30,701
the significance
of this passage?

92
00:07:30,742 --> 00:07:33,245
It's a bunch of drunk guys
doing it.

93
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:43,172
Athena wants the suitors to
keep invading Odysseus' house...

94
00:07:43,213 --> 00:07:45,632
so that he'll get angry enough
to kill them.

95
00:07:45,674 --> 00:07:47,634
And why does the goddess
want that?

96
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:54,183
She wants Odysseus
to find his strength...

97
00:07:54,224 --> 00:07:55,893
and courage?

98
00:07:55,934 --> 00:07:57,269
Very good.

99
00:08:13,577 --> 00:08:14,828
Need a ride home?

100
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:22,294
No. I'm OK. I got
a lot of catching up to do.

101
00:08:22,336 --> 00:08:23,462
You know, a lot of girls...

102
00:08:23,504 --> 00:08:24,880
don't like to let on
when they're smart.

103
00:08:24,922 --> 00:08:26,465
I know.
I shouldn't have said--

104
00:08:26,507 --> 00:08:28,842
No. No, I like that.

105
00:08:28,884 --> 00:08:31,094
I like that about you.

106
00:08:34,973 --> 00:08:38,894
A bunch of us are going to our
country club on Saturday night.

107
00:08:38,894 --> 00:08:42,648
There'll be a band.
The music's pretty cool.

108
00:08:44,358 --> 00:08:46,109
Would you like to go with me?

109
00:08:46,151 --> 00:08:49,571
I really do have
a lot of work to do.

110
00:08:49,613 --> 00:08:50,864
On a Saturday night?

111
00:08:52,032 --> 00:08:53,659
Wow.

112
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:57,746
Come on. I'm sure even Homer
took some time off...

113
00:08:57,788 --> 00:08:59,873
between The Iliad
and The Odyssey.

114
00:09:01,458 --> 00:09:03,877
Well, sure. OK.

115
00:09:03,919 --> 00:09:06,171
OK.

116
00:09:12,845 --> 00:09:14,888
We're all here now. You can go.

117
00:09:40,539 --> 00:09:41,748
Bonita.

118
00:10:52,778 --> 00:10:53,779
Eso.

119
00:11:06,583 --> 00:11:08,961
You felt the sudden urge
for Cuban music?

120
00:11:09,002 --> 00:11:11,380
The van left without me.

121
00:11:11,421 --> 00:11:12,756
I've been walking
for an hour.

122
00:11:12,798 --> 00:11:14,091
I can walk you back.

123
00:11:14,132 --> 00:11:15,717
Oh, no. You don't
have to do that.

124
00:11:15,759 --> 00:11:17,594
Oh, yeah, you're right.

125
00:11:17,636 --> 00:11:19,471
You'll find your way
sooner or later.

126
00:11:19,513 --> 00:11:22,224
Maybe in a week or a month.

127
00:11:22,266 --> 00:11:24,309
Let me just say good-bye.

128
00:11:24,351 --> 00:11:26,520
¡Abuelito!

129
00:11:32,943 --> 00:11:34,528
Bueno.

130
00:11:37,406 --> 00:11:38,365
What was it you called him?

131
00:11:38,407 --> 00:11:41,869
Abuelito. It's my grandpa.

132
00:11:43,328 --> 00:11:45,330
I'm Katey.
What's your name?

133
00:11:45,372 --> 00:11:47,249
Javier.

134
00:11:47,291 --> 00:11:51,378
So what, you know like
five words in Spanish?

135
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:53,589
Maybe ten.

136
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:55,841
And what are you
studying so hard to do?

137
00:11:55,883 --> 00:11:57,885
I haven't figured it out yet.

138
00:11:57,926 --> 00:12:00,470
Here. Let me take that.

139
00:12:05,184 --> 00:12:08,187
I've never seen
dancing like that.

140
00:12:08,228 --> 00:12:09,646
Like what?

141
00:12:09,688 --> 00:12:12,608
I don't know.

142
00:12:12,608 --> 00:12:15,319
I like it. It's very...

143
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:21,950
- Very Cuban?
- Yeah.

144
00:12:50,312 --> 00:12:52,481
- We should get off the street.
- Why?

145
00:12:52,523 --> 00:12:54,608
You don't understand
what they're singing.

146
00:13:00,614 --> 00:13:02,783
No!

147
00:13:02,824 --> 00:13:03,992
No!

148
00:13:04,034 --> 00:13:06,286
That way!

149
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:10,624
So you've got--
OK. Here she comes.

150
00:13:10,666 --> 00:13:12,543
Thank you so much.

151
00:13:12,584 --> 00:13:16,672
Thank God.
Katey, where have you been?

152
00:13:16,713 --> 00:13:18,841
I missed the bus.

153
00:13:18,882 --> 00:13:20,342
I'm fine. I walked.

154
00:13:20,384 --> 00:13:23,220
For heaven's sakes.
Katey, why didn't you call me?

155
00:13:23,262 --> 00:13:26,265
For all I knew, you could have
been kidnapped by rebels.

156
00:13:26,306 --> 00:13:29,184
It's not the rebels
you should be worried about.

157
00:13:29,226 --> 00:13:30,477
What did you say?

158
00:13:34,690 --> 00:13:38,402
You're right. I'm sorry.
I should have called.

159
00:13:38,443 --> 00:13:39,736
Honey, where's your book bag?

160
00:13:43,365 --> 00:13:45,576
I left it at school.

161
00:13:45,617 --> 00:13:46,743
It was heavy.

162
00:14:37,419 --> 00:14:39,087
Oh, God.

163
00:14:39,129 --> 00:14:42,382
It was good I had all these
boring American books with me.

164
00:14:42,424 --> 00:14:45,093
They realized I couldn't
be a revolutionary.

165
00:14:45,135 --> 00:14:47,513
I don't understand.

166
00:14:47,554 --> 00:14:48,847
They were just singing.

167
00:14:48,889 --> 00:14:51,808
There is not such a thing
as "just singing" here anymore.

168
00:14:55,062 --> 00:14:57,689
You know,
you're a pretty good dancer.

169
00:14:57,731 --> 00:15:00,776
I was terrible.

170
00:15:00,817 --> 00:15:04,613
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, you were terrible...

171
00:15:04,655 --> 00:15:07,115
but for an American,
you move well.

172
00:15:07,157 --> 00:15:08,784
Oh, thanks.

173
00:15:13,705 --> 00:15:15,916
Why do you look
in the mirror?

174
00:15:15,958 --> 00:15:18,585
I was trying to remember
the steps I saw.

175
00:15:18,627 --> 00:15:21,755
But what does looking
have to do with it?

176
00:15:21,797 --> 00:15:24,216
Just feel the music.

177
00:15:24,258 --> 00:15:26,176
You should see for yourself.

178
00:15:26,218 --> 00:15:30,639
The real dancers are at
La Rosa Negra on Saturday night.

179
00:15:33,308 --> 00:15:34,977
I can't.

180
00:15:35,018 --> 00:15:39,064
I got invited
to this country club thing.

181
00:15:39,106 --> 00:15:42,025
- Hey, that was fast.
- Yeah.

182
00:15:42,067 --> 00:15:44,444
Is that why you want
to learn Cuban dancing?

183
00:15:44,486 --> 00:15:45,863
Just to impress your date?

184
00:15:45,904 --> 00:15:47,823
No. I wanted to--

185
00:15:47,865 --> 00:15:48,824
Don't worry. Don't worry.

186
00:15:48,866 --> 00:15:50,576
They won't dance like that
at the club.

187
00:15:50,617 --> 00:15:53,120
Just learn
the fox trot instead.

188
00:15:54,454 --> 00:15:57,124
I already know the fox trot.

189
00:16:11,513 --> 00:16:13,765
Do we need to go shopping?

190
00:16:13,807 --> 00:16:15,434
I just thought you might
be going to the country club...

191
00:16:15,475 --> 00:16:17,561
Saturday night.

192
00:16:17,603 --> 00:16:19,146
Oh, you just thought?

193
00:16:19,188 --> 00:16:21,231
Mrs. Phelps took me to lunch.

194
00:16:21,273 --> 00:16:23,775
You two aren't planning
an arranged marriage, are you?

195
00:16:23,817 --> 00:16:25,194
No. I should have
thought of that.

196
00:16:26,862 --> 00:16:28,197
He's so cute.

197
00:16:40,083 --> 00:16:43,045
- Yolanda?
- Yes?

198
00:16:43,045 --> 00:16:46,173
Is this square?

199
00:16:46,215 --> 00:16:47,633
Square?

200
00:16:47,674 --> 00:16:51,303
Yeah, you know...
Iike a square?

201
00:16:51,345 --> 00:16:53,305
Is a square good or bad?

202
00:16:53,347 --> 00:16:55,474
It's bad.

203
00:16:55,516 --> 00:16:57,851
Sí.

204
00:16:57,893 --> 00:16:58,936
This is square.

205
00:16:58,977 --> 00:17:00,854
Oh, God.

206
00:17:02,231 --> 00:17:04,191
I don't know.

207
00:17:04,233 --> 00:17:07,444
You're smaller than me.
Your dresses'll be...

208
00:17:07,486 --> 00:17:09,655
Perfect.

209
00:17:11,782 --> 00:17:12,824
You're joking.

210
00:17:12,866 --> 00:17:15,494
Why? Is it square?

211
00:17:17,246 --> 00:17:18,997
Definitely not.

212
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:22,125
It's not fair!

213
00:17:22,167 --> 00:17:23,627
All of my friends are going...

214
00:17:23,669 --> 00:17:25,337
so why would you go,
and I can't?

215
00:17:25,379 --> 00:17:28,549
I am older than you.

216
00:17:28,590 --> 00:17:31,927
Such a waste. You don't
even know how to have fun.

217
00:17:49,236 --> 00:17:50,946
Sure you don't
want me to stay?

218
00:17:52,364 --> 00:17:53,699
Dad, don't.

219
00:17:55,117 --> 00:17:56,743
OK. Bye.

220
00:18:01,623 --> 00:18:03,917
Be careful.

221
00:18:25,647 --> 00:18:28,108
Polly. Polly.

222
00:18:33,614 --> 00:18:36,033
God, what'd she do?
Paint it on?

223
00:18:36,074 --> 00:18:38,035
Señorita.

224
00:18:43,373 --> 00:18:44,374
Wow!

225
00:18:45,709 --> 00:18:47,336
Oh, I don't know.

226
00:18:47,377 --> 00:18:49,087
Oh, I do.

227
00:18:51,798 --> 00:18:53,509
I would like
to invite you all...

228
00:18:53,550 --> 00:18:55,427
to the Club Palace
on Christmas Eve--

229
00:18:55,469 --> 00:18:56,803
You been to the Palace yet?

230
00:18:56,845 --> 00:18:58,764
...the tenth annual
Latin ballroom...

231
00:18:58,805 --> 00:19:00,849
amateur dance contest.

232
00:19:00,891 --> 00:19:02,059
I'll have to take you.

233
00:19:11,026 --> 00:19:14,404
Oh, yeah, yeah

234
00:19:14,446 --> 00:19:15,531
Listen

235
00:19:15,572 --> 00:19:18,826
Darling, you

236
00:19:18,867 --> 00:19:21,578
Send me

237
00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:24,540
Darling, you

238
00:19:24,581 --> 00:19:26,166
Send me

239
00:19:26,208 --> 00:19:31,171
You feel really good.
Am I making you nervous?

240
00:19:31,213 --> 00:19:32,506
No.

241
00:19:32,548 --> 00:19:35,092
Well, you make me
a little nervous...

242
00:19:35,133 --> 00:19:40,222
but don't tell anyone.
It'll ruin my reputation.

243
00:19:40,264 --> 00:19:43,392
I thought it was infatuation

244
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:46,228
Listen, we're going over
to Polly's...

245
00:19:46,270 --> 00:19:48,814
- for a little mojito party.
- Oh, yeah?

246
00:19:48,856 --> 00:19:50,858
And her parents
are out of town again.

247
00:19:50,899 --> 00:19:54,528
What do you think?
Steph can make a wicked mojito.

248
00:19:54,570 --> 00:19:56,446
Well--

249
00:19:56,488 --> 00:19:57,906
Hey, I'm sure
we can get someone...

250
00:19:57,948 --> 00:19:59,575
to rustle you up
a Shirley Temple.

251
00:20:01,577 --> 00:20:03,787
Actually...

252
00:20:03,829 --> 00:20:06,456
James and I are gonna
go to a Cuban club.

253
00:20:06,498 --> 00:20:07,499
Where?

254
00:20:08,959 --> 00:20:10,210
La Rosa Negra.

255
00:20:12,212 --> 00:20:15,674
Yeah, we're going to the...
La Rosa Negra.

256
00:20:27,436 --> 00:20:29,396
Jesus.

257
00:20:52,961 --> 00:20:54,922
Look at the way
they feel the music.

258
00:20:58,175 --> 00:21:00,302
They're feeling it,
all right.

259
00:21:04,181 --> 00:21:06,266
I'll get us some drinks.

260
00:21:37,297 --> 00:21:38,382
Hi.

261
00:21:40,217 --> 00:21:42,678
- You look so Cuban.
- So do you.

262
00:21:44,930 --> 00:21:47,057
Hi. I'm Javier.

263
00:21:48,267 --> 00:21:49,434
Name's Phelps.

264
00:21:49,476 --> 00:21:51,311
Yeah. I know you.

265
00:21:51,353 --> 00:21:55,065
So, the country club
wasn't all you expected?

266
00:21:55,107 --> 00:21:57,734
We thought we'd expand
our horizons a little bit.

267
00:21:57,776 --> 00:22:00,696
Oh, you mean actually
experience La Havana?

268
00:22:04,449 --> 00:22:07,536
Do you mind if I dance
with your date?

269
00:22:10,205 --> 00:22:11,373
Well, you'll have to ask her.

270
00:22:13,375 --> 00:22:15,335
OK.

271
00:22:18,422 --> 00:22:22,885
Te quiero Havana,
the rhythm pumpin' in my heart

272
00:22:22,926 --> 00:22:24,887
In la rosa

273
00:22:24,928 --> 00:22:28,265
We dance to the tempo
of love

274
00:22:28,307 --> 00:22:31,310
Shall we give
your boyfriend a show?

275
00:22:31,351 --> 00:22:33,478
He's not my boyfriend.

276
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:37,691
Let your body talk
till the voice in you says

277
00:22:37,733 --> 00:22:39,151
Baby

278
00:22:39,193 --> 00:22:42,738
I'm the one you find
deep in the groove

279
00:22:42,779 --> 00:22:48,494
That has your body
and your senses

280
00:22:48,535 --> 00:22:53,415
I'm the heat inside
when rhythm and love collide

281
00:22:53,415 --> 00:22:54,416
Cuba

282
00:22:54,458 --> 00:22:59,004

Must be that Yankee
dancing with my brother.

295
00:23:30,619 --> 00:23:32,454
Good of you to bring
your girlfriend to Havana...

296
00:23:32,496 --> 00:23:33,872
while you still
have the chance.

297
00:23:35,165 --> 00:23:39,044
Why? Are you gonna
run us gringos out?

298
00:23:39,086 --> 00:23:42,256
That's right, comebola,
so keep smiling.

299
00:23:44,925 --> 00:23:48,428

Raoul y Esmerelda...

king and queen
of La Rosa Negra.

315
00:24:33,974 --> 00:24:35,976
When they dance,
the floor is theirs.

316
00:24:59,124 --> 00:25:02,127
You're as good a dancer
as he is.

317
00:25:07,633 --> 00:25:10,677
Katey, this is
my brother Carlos.

318
00:25:10,719 --> 00:25:13,055
- Arturo and Miguel.
- Hola.

319
00:25:13,096 --> 00:25:15,015
Hola.

320
00:25:15,057 --> 00:25:17,226
We were just talking politics.

321
00:25:17,267 --> 00:25:20,187
Really? Well,
my brother loves talking.

322
00:25:20,229 --> 00:25:22,105
Javier doesn't like
to talk politics.

323
00:25:22,147 --> 00:25:23,440
After all, the revolution...

324
00:25:23,482 --> 00:25:25,442
would screw up his job
kissing your asses.

325
00:25:25,484 --> 00:25:27,069
And where's
the revolution tonight?

326
00:25:27,110 --> 00:25:29,321
On the dance floor?

327
00:25:29,363 --> 00:25:32,199
While you boys kiss
and make up...

328
00:25:32,241 --> 00:25:34,034
we're gonna get
some fresh air.

329
00:25:34,076 --> 00:25:35,661
Let's go.

330
00:25:45,879 --> 00:25:47,548
I was enjoying the dancing.

331
00:25:47,589 --> 00:25:50,384
You were very hot.

332
00:25:57,474 --> 00:26:00,769
It's not
the safest part of town.

333
00:26:02,563 --> 00:26:03,856
No, don't.

334
00:26:05,858 --> 00:26:08,110
Take me home, will you--

335
00:26:08,151 --> 00:26:10,195
Stop it! Get off!

336
00:26:11,238 --> 00:26:13,657
You didn't say no to him.

337
00:26:13,699 --> 00:26:14,950
No!

338
00:26:20,622 --> 00:26:23,250
Katey! Katey,
get back in the damn car!

339
00:26:23,292 --> 00:26:24,418
I'll take you home.

340
00:26:30,591 --> 00:26:32,176
Hey.

341
00:26:32,217 --> 00:26:33,886
Hey.

342
00:26:35,971 --> 00:26:38,432
- Where is he?
- He's gone. He's gone.

343
00:26:38,473 --> 00:26:40,893
It's OK. It's OK. I'm fine.

344
00:26:42,102 --> 00:26:46,523
My dad works for his dad.

345
00:26:46,565 --> 00:26:48,734
I just want to forget about it.

346
00:26:48,775 --> 00:26:51,653
Don't worry.

347
00:26:51,695 --> 00:26:54,281
I'll take you home.

348
00:26:54,323 --> 00:26:56,033
Come on.

349
00:26:58,160 --> 00:27:00,287
I should have seen it coming.

350
00:27:00,329 --> 00:27:02,247
I guess I'm not used to--

351
00:27:02,289 --> 00:27:03,999
Bastards?

352
00:27:04,041 --> 00:27:05,125
Guys.

353
00:27:05,167 --> 00:27:09,296
What? You never had
a boyfriend in America?

354
00:27:09,338 --> 00:27:13,091
No. I liked this one guy,
but it didn't work out.

355
00:27:13,133 --> 00:27:14,134
Why not?

356
00:27:14,176 --> 00:27:15,636
He didn't know I existed.

357
00:27:15,677 --> 00:27:18,764
Oh, yeah.
That could be a problem.

358
00:27:22,226 --> 00:27:23,852
This is as far as I go.

359
00:27:25,437 --> 00:27:27,856
The staff is not supposed
to mix with guests.

360
00:27:27,898 --> 00:27:30,442
It took me a long time
to find this job.

361
00:27:30,484 --> 00:27:33,070
You'd be in trouble
for walking me up there?

362
00:27:33,111 --> 00:27:34,696
Yeah.

363
00:27:34,738 --> 00:27:36,240
That's ridiculous.

364
00:27:47,918 --> 00:27:49,503
Adios.

365
00:27:52,506 --> 00:27:54,299
Thanks for walking me home.

366
00:27:55,676 --> 00:27:59,680
I'm sorry your evening
was so difficult.

367
00:28:01,265 --> 00:28:02,724
Not all of it was.

368
00:28:37,134 --> 00:28:39,011
My job is to make you
look beautiful.

369
00:28:39,052 --> 00:28:43,473
Your job is to make
our bodies like one. Watch.

370
00:29:29,645 --> 00:29:33,023
Thanks.
OK, that's it for today.

371
00:29:34,566 --> 00:29:37,027
Who's gonna enter
the big dance contest?

372
00:29:37,069 --> 00:29:38,529
Isn't it just for locals?

373
00:29:38,570 --> 00:29:40,531
Actually, it's for anyone
who has the guts to try.

374
00:29:40,572 --> 00:29:42,115
What about you?

375
00:29:43,450 --> 00:29:44,535
Me?

376
00:29:45,661 --> 00:29:47,287
No, I can't.
I'm not good enough.

377
00:29:48,413 --> 00:29:50,833
Sure you are.
I've seen you practicing.

378
00:29:56,338 --> 00:29:57,464
Easy.

379
00:30:07,474 --> 00:30:09,101
Think about it.

380
00:30:16,233 --> 00:30:17,192
Katey!

381
00:30:17,234 --> 00:30:19,486
You left your sweater
in my car.

382
00:30:19,528 --> 00:30:21,989
- Just bring it to school.
- Hey, wait a second.

383
00:30:22,030 --> 00:30:23,031
Katey.

384
00:30:25,492 --> 00:30:26,827
I'm really sorry.

385
00:30:26,869 --> 00:30:31,707
I was drinking.
I would never hurt you.

386
00:30:31,748 --> 00:30:33,458
He's not here.

387
00:30:36,128 --> 00:30:37,379
They fired him.

388
00:30:37,421 --> 00:30:38,797
What?

389
00:30:38,839 --> 00:30:42,634
Lois and your sister,
they saw you.

390
00:30:45,095 --> 00:30:46,847
I'm sorry.

391
00:30:46,889 --> 00:30:48,724
I gotta go.

392
00:30:59,776 --> 00:31:01,862
You know, you need to keep
your mouth shut.

393
00:31:01,904 --> 00:31:03,572
The things you do
have consequences.

394
00:31:03,614 --> 00:31:05,574
Lois is the one
who blabbed it.

395
00:31:05,616 --> 00:31:08,869
Oh, right. And you had
nothing to do with it.

396
00:31:08,911 --> 00:31:11,580
Well, what were you doing
with that guy, anyway?

397
00:31:11,622 --> 00:31:13,207
It's embarrassing.

398
00:31:13,248 --> 00:31:15,834
Is that you talking,
or is it those other girls?

399
00:31:15,876 --> 00:31:17,836
He's not like us.

400
00:31:17,878 --> 00:31:20,130
There is no "us," Susie.

401
00:31:33,936 --> 00:31:36,522
- Hola.
- Hola.

402
00:31:41,818 --> 00:31:43,445
Sí.

403
00:31:44,780 --> 00:31:45,864
Yes?

404
00:31:45,906 --> 00:31:47,491
I'm a friend of Javier's.

405
00:31:47,533 --> 00:31:48,575
¿Cómo?

406
00:31:48,617 --> 00:31:50,661
From the hotel.

407
00:31:52,704 --> 00:31:55,666
I didn't know he had friends
in the hotel.

408
00:31:57,292 --> 00:31:58,585
Is he here?

409
00:31:58,627 --> 00:32:02,714
No. He's working there now.

410
00:32:02,756 --> 00:32:04,216
You don't see him?

411
00:32:16,603 --> 00:32:20,357
So, what do you want
with my brother?

412
00:32:20,399 --> 00:32:23,110
I need to talk to him.

413
00:32:23,151 --> 00:32:26,613
You got him fired.
Isn't that enough?

414
00:32:28,824 --> 00:32:30,868
I know a way
he can make some money.

415
00:32:32,286 --> 00:32:33,704
You Yankees,
you come here...

416
00:32:33,745 --> 00:32:35,622
and you pour money
into the casinos...

417
00:32:35,664 --> 00:32:37,082
into the pockets
of the gangsters...

418
00:32:37,124 --> 00:32:38,375
who run this country...

419
00:32:38,417 --> 00:32:40,752
the same gangsters
who murder innocent people...

420
00:32:40,794 --> 00:32:42,546
Iike my father.

421
00:32:42,588 --> 00:32:44,298
I didn't know.

422
00:32:44,339 --> 00:32:47,759
That's right. You don't know.

423
00:32:57,102 --> 00:32:58,812
Javi.

424
00:33:04,693 --> 00:33:06,570
I feel terrible
about what happened.

425
00:33:06,612 --> 00:33:07,738
I went to your house--

426
00:33:07,779 --> 00:33:10,032
My house? You told
my mother I was fired?

427
00:33:10,073 --> 00:33:12,034
- No, I didn't--
- Then what do you want?

428
00:33:12,075 --> 00:33:14,203
I told her I wanted
to talk to you.

429
00:33:14,244 --> 00:33:15,787
I'm sorry you got fired.

430
00:33:17,581 --> 00:33:20,667
Don't worry. It's my fault.
I knew better.

431
00:33:20,709 --> 00:33:23,504
Is this your new job?

432
00:33:23,545 --> 00:33:26,089
That's right.
You make 'em. We steal 'em.

433
00:33:26,131 --> 00:33:28,217
Isn't that right, Javi?

434
00:33:33,263 --> 00:33:37,434
There's this dance contest...

435
00:33:37,476 --> 00:33:40,729
at the Palace--
Christmas Eve.

436
00:33:40,771 --> 00:33:42,314
I think you should go.

437
00:33:42,356 --> 00:33:44,566
And see if they need
any busboys?

438
00:33:44,608 --> 00:33:47,194
That's not what I mean.

439
00:33:47,236 --> 00:33:50,322
You know what kind of people
goes to the Palace?

440
00:33:50,364 --> 00:33:52,366
I could get you in.

441
00:33:52,407 --> 00:33:54,368
You'd have to be my partner.

442
00:33:58,831 --> 00:34:00,457
You mean, dance with you?

443
00:34:00,499 --> 00:34:03,460
God, I'm not that bad.

444
00:34:06,380 --> 00:34:07,548
You didn't seem
to mind it last night.

445
00:34:07,589 --> 00:34:09,466
I wasn't trying
to win a contest.

446
00:34:09,508 --> 00:34:10,634
Oh, weren't you?

447
00:34:15,180 --> 00:34:17,474
I'm sorry, but I have
a lot of work to do.

448
00:34:17,516 --> 00:34:23,146
The prize for
the semifinals is $300.

449
00:34:23,188 --> 00:34:25,357
The grand prize is $5,000.

450
00:34:25,399 --> 00:34:27,860
The winners
get to go to America.

451
00:34:29,611 --> 00:34:31,321
I don't have time.

452
00:35:37,930 --> 00:35:39,181
Hi.

453
00:35:45,854 --> 00:35:47,940
This contest...

454
00:35:47,981 --> 00:35:49,441
does it cost money?

455
00:35:50,859 --> 00:35:52,069
No.

456
00:35:53,612 --> 00:35:55,572
You know that
it's ballroom dancing.

457
00:35:55,614 --> 00:35:56,824
It's not what I do.

458
00:35:56,865 --> 00:35:59,993
It's Latin ballroom. If we mix
what you do with what I do...

459
00:36:00,035 --> 00:36:02,538
I really think
we'd have something.

460
00:36:02,579 --> 00:36:04,790
I still have
to teach you everything.

461
00:36:04,832 --> 00:36:06,834
Not everything.

462
00:36:06,875 --> 00:36:09,753
I'll have to teach you
a few things, too.

463
00:36:14,550 --> 00:36:16,552
Can we do this?

464
00:36:25,185 --> 00:36:26,770
- What?
- What are you doing?

465
00:36:26,812 --> 00:36:28,605
Just dancing.

466
00:36:28,647 --> 00:36:31,233
But this is a routine.

467
00:36:31,275 --> 00:36:33,777
You can't just do
what you feel like...

468
00:36:33,819 --> 00:36:34,778
when you feel like it.

469
00:36:34,820 --> 00:36:36,238
When I dance,
I have no routine.

470
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:38,699
But this is a contest.
We need a structure.

471
00:36:38,740 --> 00:36:40,576
Can I see that?

472
00:36:45,372 --> 00:36:48,333
First, you learn to move,
and then we worry...

473
00:36:48,375 --> 00:36:50,711
- about lists and words.
- OK. Fine.

474
00:36:50,752 --> 00:36:53,297
How do you call this?

475
00:36:53,338 --> 00:36:54,965
Your hips?

476
00:36:55,007 --> 00:36:57,217
Move your hips.

477
00:36:57,259 --> 00:36:59,428
And circle.

478
00:36:59,469 --> 00:37:01,513
Come on.

479
00:37:01,555 --> 00:37:03,682
Come on. And circle.

480
00:37:04,933 --> 00:37:06,018
That's a box.

481
00:37:06,059 --> 00:37:08,103
What, are you crazy?

482
00:37:08,145 --> 00:37:09,771
Why should I cover for you?

483
00:37:09,813 --> 00:37:11,940
You want me to tell them
what happened?

484
00:37:11,982 --> 00:37:14,985
Well, hello there.

485
00:37:15,027 --> 00:37:16,028
Mom!

486
00:37:16,069 --> 00:37:17,029
We're just heading over
for some lemonade.

487
00:37:17,070 --> 00:37:20,032
- Would you care to join us?
- No, no.

488
00:37:20,073 --> 00:37:21,533
We'll take a rain check.

489
00:37:21,575 --> 00:37:23,410
OK. You two have fun.

490
00:37:23,452 --> 00:37:26,538
I'm gonna help Javier,
and you're gonna help me.

491
00:37:31,752 --> 00:37:33,337
Your frame is really weak.

492
00:37:36,673 --> 00:37:37,633
Better?

493
00:37:37,674 --> 00:37:40,761
I could do without
the bruises, thanks.

494
00:37:42,888 --> 00:37:44,806
I can fit another couple
between us.

495
00:37:44,806 --> 00:37:47,643
It's not gonna be
a crowded club.

496
00:37:47,684 --> 00:37:50,479
We've gotta sweep
across the dance floor.

497
00:37:50,521 --> 00:37:52,981
OK. OK, I can sweep.

498
00:37:55,484 --> 00:37:57,611
What are you doing?
Your steps are too big.

499
00:37:57,653 --> 00:37:59,404
No, I'm sweeping.

500
00:37:59,446 --> 00:38:01,073
How's it going with James?

501
00:38:01,114 --> 00:38:02,366
I got homework to do.

502
00:38:02,407 --> 00:38:05,744
You know what, sweetie?

503
00:38:05,786 --> 00:38:10,958
I've been wanting to ask you
if you have any questions or...

504
00:38:10,999 --> 00:38:13,585
concerns, you know,
about you and James.

505
00:38:15,712 --> 00:38:20,759
It's like dancing
with my mother's ironing board.

506
00:38:22,094 --> 00:38:24,179
Just close your eyes.

507
00:38:24,221 --> 00:38:25,472
Why?

508
00:38:25,514 --> 00:38:26,598
Just do it.

509
00:38:37,109 --> 00:38:38,861
It's awkward
to talk about, but...

510
00:38:38,902 --> 00:38:42,322
it's important that
you not let a boy pressure you.

511
00:38:42,364 --> 00:38:44,950
And even if you have
certain feelings...

512
00:38:44,992 --> 00:38:46,243
when you're with James...

513
00:38:46,285 --> 00:38:50,122
feelings that you aren't
used to having...

514
00:38:58,672 --> 00:38:59,756
Oh, God!

515
00:38:59,798 --> 00:39:01,175
Do you have to be such a guy?

516
00:39:03,719 --> 00:39:06,013
OK.

517
00:39:06,054 --> 00:39:08,182
OK, I'll be the girl.

518
00:39:12,978 --> 00:39:17,107
The decisions you make now,
the choices you make...

519
00:39:17,149 --> 00:39:18,859
could affect your whole life.

520
00:39:20,402 --> 00:39:21,695
Do you understand
what I'm saying?

521
00:39:22,779 --> 00:39:24,406
You do?

522
00:40:11,787 --> 00:40:14,039
I didn't want
to waste the music.

523
00:40:15,958 --> 00:40:18,710
No, of course not.

524
00:40:18,752 --> 00:40:21,046
What's the problem?

525
00:40:21,088 --> 00:40:23,006
Why are you so afraid
to let me lead you?

526
00:40:25,300 --> 00:40:26,510
I'm not.

527
00:40:27,803 --> 00:40:31,723
You are. When you're ready
to say you're afraid...

528
00:40:31,765 --> 00:40:34,393
Iet me know.

529
00:40:42,025 --> 00:40:43,527
- Hey.
- Sorry.

530
00:40:43,569 --> 00:40:47,156
No, no, no. Stay.
I'm almost done anyway.

531
00:40:47,197 --> 00:40:49,950
So, what did you decide?

532
00:40:51,535 --> 00:40:52,953
I entered the contest.

533
00:40:52,995 --> 00:40:55,998
All right. Good for you.

534
00:40:56,039 --> 00:40:58,000
So, how's it going?

535
00:40:58,041 --> 00:41:00,878
Oh, great. It's going great.

536
00:41:04,089 --> 00:41:05,257
Really?

537
00:41:05,299 --> 00:41:07,634
No, it's not.

538
00:41:09,553 --> 00:41:12,556
God, I must have been crazy
to think we could do this.

539
00:41:12,598 --> 00:41:13,807
It's in two weeks...

540
00:41:13,849 --> 00:41:18,812
and whenever he pushes,
I pull...

541
00:41:18,854 --> 00:41:21,773
and I'm flowing,
and I'm being free...

542
00:41:21,815 --> 00:41:23,066
and I'm making a circle...

543
00:41:23,108 --> 00:41:25,569
and I'm not
an ironing board anymore...

544
00:41:25,611 --> 00:41:27,571
and it's still not working.

545
00:41:27,613 --> 00:41:31,241
And now he says,
"You're afraid."

546
00:41:31,283 --> 00:41:33,785
Are you?

547
00:41:33,869 --> 00:41:35,287
No.

548
00:41:36,955 --> 00:41:38,540
That's too bad.

549
00:41:42,961 --> 00:41:44,963
Come here un momento.

550
00:41:45,005 --> 00:41:46,465
Stand right here.

551
00:41:48,258 --> 00:41:51,261
Let me see your frame.

552
00:41:51,303 --> 00:41:52,679
Good.

553
00:41:55,933 --> 00:41:57,017
A little pressure.

554
00:42:03,524 --> 00:42:05,692
So, where'd you learn this?

555
00:42:05,734 --> 00:42:08,028
My parents. They were dancers.

556
00:42:08,070 --> 00:42:09,446
Really?

557
00:42:12,241 --> 00:42:13,700
Relax.

558
00:42:13,742 --> 00:42:15,327
Yes.

559
00:42:15,369 --> 00:42:16,912
Drop your arms.

560
00:42:16,954 --> 00:42:18,997
Breathe.

561
00:42:21,375 --> 00:42:23,085
Now just basic.

562
00:42:25,754 --> 00:42:27,214
Good.

563
00:42:29,049 --> 00:42:32,928
What did you mean when you said,
"That's too bad"?

564
00:42:32,970 --> 00:42:34,555
If you can't move
through your fear...

565
00:42:34,596 --> 00:42:36,181
and connect with yourself...

566
00:42:36,223 --> 00:42:37,683
there's absolutely no way...

567
00:42:37,724 --> 00:42:39,893
you're gonna connect
with your partner.

568
00:42:39,935 --> 00:42:41,770
Listen to me.

569
00:42:41,812 --> 00:42:45,274
I know that
it's scary as hell...

570
00:42:45,274 --> 00:42:47,234
to let another person
touch that part of you.

571
00:42:47,276 --> 00:42:50,821
But if you do, it's worth it.

572
00:42:52,281 --> 00:42:54,241
Now forget everything
I just said and dance.

573
00:44:03,852 --> 00:44:05,229
The floor is yours.

574
00:44:06,772 --> 00:44:08,607
I'll see you.

575
00:44:20,452 --> 00:44:21,745
OK, I am.

576
00:44:23,956 --> 00:44:25,165
You're what?

577
00:44:27,751 --> 00:44:28,919
Afraid.

578
00:44:31,713 --> 00:44:34,299
So the movement has to be fluid
like the water.

579
00:44:35,926 --> 00:44:38,846
Afro-Cuban dance,
it's the dance of slaves.

580
00:44:38,887 --> 00:44:42,683
When they danced, it was
their only time to feel free.

581
00:44:42,724 --> 00:44:47,604
So they could be a bird,
you know...

582
00:44:47,646 --> 00:44:52,568
or do a flamenco step
and make fun of their owners.

583
00:44:52,609 --> 00:44:53,777
Or just be in the sea...

584
00:44:53,819 --> 00:44:56,697
instead of being stuck
on an island away from home.

585
00:44:58,448 --> 00:45:01,326
It's a dance about being exactly
who you want to be...

586
00:45:01,368 --> 00:45:02,452
in that moment.

587
00:45:07,666 --> 00:45:12,880
It has to feel and look...

588
00:45:12,921 --> 00:45:15,757
as natural as the waves.

589
00:45:15,799 --> 00:45:17,634
Coming...

590
00:45:17,676 --> 00:45:20,721
and going.

591
00:45:20,762 --> 00:45:22,472
Coming...

592
00:45:27,603 --> 00:45:30,898
We were having dinner, and
there was a knock on the door.

593
00:45:30,939 --> 00:45:34,026
Suddenly two policemen
were taking my father away.

594
00:45:34,067 --> 00:45:36,028
The traitor
could have been anyone.

595
00:45:36,069 --> 00:45:40,032
Batista has
his spies everywhere.

596
00:45:40,073 --> 00:45:41,575
That's the thing, you know?

597
00:45:41,617 --> 00:45:45,787
My father never hurt anybody.
He was just a free thinker...

598
00:45:45,829 --> 00:45:47,956
but someone
didn't like his thoughts.

599
00:45:50,334 --> 00:45:54,004
We had a funeral,
but we never found his body.

600
00:45:54,046 --> 00:45:57,466
Carlos disappeared for a while,
afraid he would be next...

601
00:45:57,508 --> 00:45:59,593
and then this girl shows up
with a baby...

602
00:45:59,635 --> 00:46:01,428
says it's his
and she cannot afford it...

603
00:46:01,470 --> 00:46:05,098
and suddenly I'm in charge
of my whole family.

604
00:46:05,140 --> 00:46:07,893
Maybe it's not
what you want for yourself...

605
00:46:07,935 --> 00:46:09,895
but you are
making a difference.

606
00:46:09,978 --> 00:46:13,023
There's a revolution out there,
and what am I doing?

607
00:46:13,065 --> 00:46:15,818
Just painting stolen cars
and baby-sitting.

608
00:46:15,859 --> 00:46:17,444
No, you're keeping
your family alive.

609
00:46:17,486 --> 00:46:20,072
That's the most important
thing you could do.

610
00:46:23,826 --> 00:46:27,329
If we could really
win this contest...

611
00:46:27,371 --> 00:46:32,376
maybe I could bring my family
to America with us.

612
00:46:39,591 --> 00:46:42,511
Your parents, they're perfect.

613
00:46:44,721 --> 00:46:47,182
You see how much they want to be
in each other's arms?

614
00:46:48,725 --> 00:46:53,188
For us to dance together,
I mean really dance...

615
00:46:53,188 --> 00:46:55,232
that's how it has to be.

616
00:48:21,193 --> 00:48:23,111
Oh, don't let us
interrupt you.

617
00:48:23,153 --> 00:48:25,489
- No, we were just--
- Yeah, we saw.

618
00:48:25,531 --> 00:48:27,199
Listen, we have more stuff
in the alley...

619
00:48:27,241 --> 00:48:30,035
if you want to do
something useful, Javier.

620
00:48:31,829 --> 00:48:34,122
I should get home.

621
00:48:50,597 --> 00:48:53,767
Thanks for stopping by.

622
00:48:53,809 --> 00:48:55,519
It's half an hour
before curfew.

623
00:48:55,561 --> 00:48:58,105
What'd you do, join the circus?

624
00:49:00,691 --> 00:49:03,944
You're gonna tell me
you were out with James?

625
00:49:03,986 --> 00:49:05,571
That's what you told
your mother.

626
00:49:05,654 --> 00:49:10,242
I never told her
what Susie said.

627
00:49:10,284 --> 00:49:11,451
Susie was wrong.

628
00:49:14,496 --> 00:49:15,539
OK.

629
00:49:15,581 --> 00:49:17,749
Good night, Dad.

630
00:49:21,837 --> 00:49:22,963
Hi.

631
00:49:27,050 --> 00:49:29,428
How long you gonna be mad at me?

632
00:49:35,809 --> 00:49:37,144
The girls here.

633
00:49:37,186 --> 00:49:38,812
I told Lois that
I like "Jane Eyre"...

634
00:49:38,854 --> 00:49:40,814
and she asked me
what movie she was in.

635
00:49:44,860 --> 00:49:47,154
I'm really sorry
that I told on you.

636
00:49:48,989 --> 00:49:52,326
And what I said about Javier,
I was wrong.

637
00:49:58,499 --> 00:50:00,250
You gotta think
for yourself, Suze.

638
00:50:00,292 --> 00:50:02,794
I know.

639
00:50:02,878 --> 00:50:03,879
I miss you.

640
00:50:11,470 --> 00:50:14,181
Well, I've been
dying to tell you.

641
00:50:14,223 --> 00:50:16,225
Can you keep a secret
this time?

642
00:53:06,436 --> 00:53:07,855
No.

643
00:53:11,066 --> 00:53:12,192
Sí. Claro.

644
00:53:23,453 --> 00:53:27,875
Susie, your mother and I have
some very disappointing news.

645
00:53:27,916 --> 00:53:30,210
Now, I know how you love to
decorate the Christmas tree...

646
00:53:30,252 --> 00:53:32,171
and sing carols
and watch home movies...

647
00:53:32,212 --> 00:53:34,173
but I'm afraid tonight...

648
00:53:34,256 --> 00:53:36,466
we're all gonna have
to go to the Palace.

649
00:53:37,593 --> 00:53:40,637
- All of us?
- Yes, Susie, all of us.

650
00:53:40,679 --> 00:53:42,389
I know it's your big night
with James...

651
00:53:42,431 --> 00:53:45,309
but you think you could save
your old man one dance?

652
00:53:45,350 --> 00:53:47,019
When did this happen?

653
00:53:47,060 --> 00:53:48,395
Well, you know your father.

654
00:53:48,437 --> 00:53:50,439
Blabs to everyone
we were dancers.

655
00:53:50,481 --> 00:53:53,317
So the Phelpses invited us
to the Latin ballroom contest.

656
00:53:53,358 --> 00:53:55,319
Where I hear the dancing
is supposed to be pretty good...

657
00:53:55,360 --> 00:53:58,113
but your mother and I will be
looking out for mistakes.

658
00:54:07,539 --> 00:54:10,417
I can't wait to see the looks
on your parents' faces.

659
00:54:10,459 --> 00:54:11,835
Don't remind me.

660
00:54:11,877 --> 00:54:13,420
I really should
be scolding you...

661
00:54:13,462 --> 00:54:15,214
for keeping her out
till all hours.

662
00:54:15,255 --> 00:54:17,674
Don't worry, ma'am. We've done
nothing you'd disapprove of.

663
00:54:17,716 --> 00:54:19,635
I can promise you that.

664
00:54:32,064 --> 00:54:33,607
Thank you.

665
00:54:33,649 --> 00:54:35,359
Here.

666
00:54:35,400 --> 00:54:37,361
You two make a very cute couple.

667
00:54:37,402 --> 00:54:40,072
So many of the girls coming over
from the states these days...

668
00:54:40,113 --> 00:54:42,699
get a little,
you know, wild.

669
00:54:42,741 --> 00:54:45,452
You're lucky to have
such lovely daughters.

670
00:54:46,662 --> 00:54:48,664
Ladies and gentlemen,
Merry Christmas!

671
00:54:48,705 --> 00:54:49,706
In just a few moments...

672
00:54:49,748 --> 00:54:52,501
we'll begin this evening's
special event.

673
00:54:52,543 --> 00:54:55,420
So, when do we get to see
the championship dancers?

674
00:54:55,462 --> 00:54:57,047
We're hardly champions.

675
00:54:57,089 --> 00:54:59,550
You're just being modest.

676
00:54:59,591 --> 00:55:03,136
Come on. I've never seen
you guys dance in public before.

677
00:55:03,178 --> 00:55:05,722
Actually, I thought
if your husband didn't mind...

678
00:55:05,764 --> 00:55:06,974
you and I might...

679
00:55:08,100 --> 00:55:10,602
James...

680
00:55:10,686 --> 00:55:12,646
Maybe Katey
would like to dance.

681
00:55:13,939 --> 00:55:15,649
Would you like to dance?

682
00:55:17,276 --> 00:55:19,278
I have to find
the ladies' room.

683
00:55:19,361 --> 00:55:20,654
I'll escort you.

684
00:55:20,696 --> 00:55:21,905
No, no, I'm fine.

685
00:55:32,457 --> 00:55:34,376
- Where have you been?
- I'm sorry. I was--

686
00:55:34,418 --> 00:55:36,712
This was a crazy idea.

687
00:55:36,753 --> 00:55:38,005
No. We're gonna win.

688
00:55:43,260 --> 00:55:45,262
This is the moment
you have all been waiting for...

689
00:55:45,304 --> 00:55:48,182
the Latin ballroom competition!

690
00:55:48,223 --> 00:55:50,100
Three talented couples
will be chosen...

691
00:55:50,142 --> 00:55:52,019
to compete in the finals
on New Year's Eve.

692
00:55:52,060 --> 00:55:54,730
- Que bonita.
- Gracias.

693
00:55:54,771 --> 00:55:55,939
Señoritas and señores...

694
00:55:55,981 --> 00:55:58,859
presenting the brightest star
of the Havana night...

695
00:55:58,901 --> 00:56:01,320
Lola Martinez!

696
00:56:07,993 --> 00:56:09,912
Where's Katey?

697
00:56:11,079 --> 00:56:12,664
Just wait.

698
00:56:17,419 --> 00:56:19,213
Oh, my God!

699
00:56:23,008 --> 00:56:25,427
Funny thing is
when I look into your eyes

700
00:56:25,469 --> 00:56:28,222
I sense something
so sincere in your disguise

701
00:56:28,263 --> 00:56:30,933
You whisper secrets
I hear only in my dreams

702
00:56:30,974 --> 00:56:33,769
Then I wake up
to your tele-smoke screen

703
00:56:33,811 --> 00:56:36,438
I wait patiently
while you play your game

704
00:56:36,480 --> 00:56:38,315
'Cause in the end

705
00:56:38,357 --> 00:56:40,359
I'll be the winner
all the same

706
00:56:40,442 --> 00:56:42,903
You'll see clearly
when the song comes to a stop

707
00:56:42,945 --> 00:56:45,072
I'll be the one
blowing kisses from the top

708
00:56:45,113 --> 00:56:47,658
So, baby, stop,
you're surrounded

709
00:56:47,699 --> 00:56:50,911
I got my love,
love all around ya

710
00:56:50,953 --> 00:56:53,789
One wrong move,
and I'll drown ya

711
00:56:53,831 --> 00:56:56,875
And that'll end ya,
you should surrender

712
00:56:56,959 --> 00:56:59,336
You'll never win
unless you give in

713
00:56:59,378 --> 00:57:02,089
So, stop, baby,
stop, you're surrounded

714
00:57:02,130 --> 00:57:05,509
I got my love,
love all around ya

715
00:57:05,551 --> 00:57:08,804
One wrong move,
and I'll drown ya

716
00:57:08,846 --> 00:57:11,181
And that'll end ya,
you should surrender

717
00:57:11,223 --> 00:57:13,100
You'll never win
unless you give in

718
00:57:13,141 --> 00:57:16,019
So won't you give
our love a chance?

719
00:57:16,061 --> 00:57:18,772
Or do you only wanna dance?

720
00:57:20,065 --> 00:57:23,193
You put your lips
very closely to my face

721
00:57:23,235 --> 00:57:26,113
And then you run away,
and so begins the chase

722
00:57:26,155 --> 00:57:28,448
I'll be the hunter,
but, boy, you better pray

723
00:57:28,490 --> 00:57:32,411
'Cause when I want ya,
I'll get you anyway

724
00:57:32,494 --> 00:57:34,955
You know what I wanna do,
it ain't nothing new

725
00:57:34,997 --> 00:57:39,126
I'm tired of dropping clues,
so when I step to you

726
00:57:39,168 --> 00:57:40,711
Will you rise
to my occasion

727
00:57:40,752 --> 00:57:44,131
Or will you make me
change your station?

728
00:57:44,173 --> 00:57:45,465
Stop, you're surrounded

729
00:57:45,507 --> 00:57:48,302
I got my love,
love all around ya

730
00:57:48,343 --> 00:57:51,013
One wrong move,
and I'll drown ya

731
00:57:51,054 --> 00:57:54,558
And that'll end ya,
you should surrender

732
00:57:54,600 --> 00:57:56,977
You'll never win
unless you give in

733
00:57:57,019 --> 00:58:00,397
So, stop,
stop, you're surrounded

734
00:58:00,439 --> 00:58:03,233
I got my love,
love all around ya

735
00:58:03,275 --> 00:58:06,570
One wrong move,
and I'll drown ya

736
00:58:06,612 --> 00:58:08,989
And that'll end ya,
you should surrender

737
00:58:09,031 --> 00:58:11,492
You'll never win
unless you give in

738
00:58:11,533 --> 00:58:14,661
So won't you give
our love a chance?

739
00:58:14,703 --> 00:58:15,954
If you take my hands

740
00:58:15,996 --> 00:58:18,916
And follow my lead,
I'll make you dance

741
00:58:18,957 --> 00:58:20,209
I can make you dance

742
00:58:20,250 --> 00:58:22,753
But if you get my feet
and miss the beat

743
00:58:22,794 --> 00:58:24,922
Then I can't take
that chance

744
00:58:24,963 --> 00:58:26,340
I can't take that chance

745
00:58:26,381 --> 00:58:29,384
If you take my hands
and follow my lead

746
00:58:29,426 --> 00:58:31,678
I'll make you dance,
I can make you dance

747
00:58:31,720 --> 00:58:33,889
But if you get my feet
and miss the beat

748
00:58:33,931 --> 00:58:36,183
Then I can't take
that chance

749
00:58:36,225 --> 00:58:37,518
I can't take it

750
00:58:37,559 --> 00:58:40,687
So, stop,
stop, you're surrounded

751
00:58:40,729 --> 00:58:43,357
I got my love,
love all around ya

752
00:58:43,398 --> 00:58:45,943
One wrong move,
and I'll drown ya

753
00:58:45,984 --> 00:58:49,696
So, stop,
stop, you're surrounded

754
00:58:49,738 --> 00:58:52,366
I got my love,
love all around ya

755
00:58:52,407 --> 00:58:55,452
One wrong move,
and I'll drown ya

756
00:58:55,494 --> 00:58:58,205
And that'll end ya,
you should surrender

757
00:58:58,247 --> 00:59:00,874
You'll never win
unless you give in

758
00:59:00,916 --> 00:59:03,001
So won't you give
our love a chance?

759
00:59:25,107 --> 00:59:26,733
Ladies and gentlemen...

760
00:59:26,775 --> 00:59:31,488
the judges have chosen our three
finalist couples for next week.

761
00:59:31,530 --> 00:59:34,158
And they are
couple number five...

762
00:59:34,199 --> 00:59:38,912
Jose Velarde and Iris Mesa!

763
00:59:40,164 --> 00:59:43,250
Couple number nine...

764
00:59:43,292 --> 00:59:46,420
Tino and Lourdes Martel!

765
00:59:48,797 --> 00:59:51,258
And...

766
00:59:51,300 --> 00:59:53,677
couple number two...

767
00:59:53,719 --> 00:59:58,223
Javier Suarez
and Katey Miller!

768
01:00:09,526 --> 01:00:10,569
What could we have
possibly done...

769
01:00:10,611 --> 01:00:12,654
to make you want
to hurt us so much?

770
01:00:12,696 --> 01:00:14,490
You humiliate us
in front of everyone...

771
01:00:14,531 --> 01:00:16,492
including your father's boss.

772
01:00:16,533 --> 01:00:17,951
What, did you figure
that he'd lose his job...

773
01:00:17,951 --> 01:00:20,787
- No one's losing their job.
- You going to lose your job?

774
01:00:20,829 --> 01:00:22,206
No. Please, go to bed.

775
01:00:22,247 --> 01:00:23,832
I didn't do anything.

776
01:00:23,874 --> 01:00:26,418
- You lied to us.
- I know, and I'm sorry...

777
01:00:26,502 --> 01:00:27,961
but I knew you wouldn't
let me try--

778
01:00:27,961 --> 01:00:29,713
Kiss a Cuban pool boy
in front of everyone?

779
01:00:29,755 --> 01:00:31,590
You're damn straight
we wouldn't.

780
01:00:31,632 --> 01:00:33,467
And why in the world
would you want to hurt James?

781
01:00:33,509 --> 01:00:35,177
I thought you liked him.

782
01:00:35,219 --> 01:00:37,179
No, you liked him...

783
01:00:37,221 --> 01:00:40,265
'cause he fits into
your perfect country club world.

784
01:00:40,349 --> 01:00:42,309
There's nothing wrong
with that world.

785
01:00:42,351 --> 01:00:44,645
No, but he couldn't
keep his hands off me.

786
01:00:44,686 --> 01:00:46,772
What? What happened?

787
01:00:46,814 --> 01:00:49,024
Nothing happened. I'm fine.

788
01:00:49,066 --> 01:00:50,067
Why didn't you tell us?

789
01:00:50,108 --> 01:00:52,194
Because I didn't want
to mess up your job!

790
01:00:53,654 --> 01:00:55,989
Katey, how could you think...

791
01:00:56,031 --> 01:00:58,325
that my job would be
more important than you?

792
01:00:59,910 --> 01:01:01,954
I didn't want to hurt you.

793
01:01:03,455 --> 01:01:08,168
I just wanted to help Javier,
which is his name, by the way.

794
01:01:10,921 --> 01:01:13,674
Oh, God,
I love dancing with him.

795
01:01:13,715 --> 01:01:16,343
Oh, Katey.

796
01:01:18,762 --> 01:01:22,683
Did it ever occur to you that
that boy might be using you?

797
01:01:22,724 --> 01:01:24,518
A nice American girl who can be
his ticket out of Havana?

798
01:01:24,560 --> 01:01:25,519
That's not true.

799
01:01:25,561 --> 01:01:26,562
You may love dancing
with that boy...

800
01:01:26,603 --> 01:01:27,729
but there are more
important factors here...

801
01:01:27,771 --> 01:01:30,023
Iike your family
and your future!

802
01:01:30,023 --> 01:01:31,233
Why does it have
to be either- or?

803
01:01:31,275 --> 01:01:33,735
Just because you gave up
your passion, why should I?

804
01:01:41,577 --> 01:01:43,537
Katey.

805
01:01:45,789 --> 01:01:47,749
Katey.

806
01:01:47,791 --> 01:01:50,210
Katey, wait. Honey, wait!

807
01:01:50,252 --> 01:01:51,587
I'm going to Javier's.

808
01:01:51,628 --> 01:01:53,463
Your mother's just trying
to protect you.

809
01:01:53,505 --> 01:01:54,882
I'm gonna be out there
on New Year's Eve...

810
01:01:54,923 --> 01:01:57,092
no matter what
you and Mom think.

811
01:01:57,134 --> 01:01:59,052
No more lies.

812
01:02:04,683 --> 01:02:06,727
He's out celebrating...

813
01:02:06,768 --> 01:02:10,939
so if you want
to wait for him...

814
01:02:16,612 --> 01:02:18,071
That was Katey.

815
01:02:20,699 --> 01:02:23,285
It's OK. She's with his mother.

816
01:02:23,327 --> 01:02:25,662
Was I wrong?

817
01:02:25,704 --> 01:02:27,581
No...

818
01:02:27,623 --> 01:02:29,458
but neither was Katey.

819
01:02:30,876 --> 01:02:32,377
Sometimes I wish we--

820
01:02:32,461 --> 01:02:36,465
I just try to imagine
what it would be like...

821
01:02:36,507 --> 01:02:38,800
if we hadn't had...

822
01:02:41,845 --> 01:02:43,889
Does it make me a bad mother?

823
01:02:43,972 --> 01:02:45,724
Of course not.

824
01:02:49,144 --> 01:02:52,231
You were good.
It's OK to miss it.

825
01:02:54,817 --> 01:02:57,361
They sure spiced up
our old routine, didn't they?

826
01:02:57,402 --> 01:02:58,821
I'll say.

827
01:02:58,862 --> 01:03:00,823
That wouldn't have gone over
too well at Roseland, would it?

828
01:03:00,864 --> 01:03:02,449
No.

829
01:03:05,202 --> 01:03:08,413
Bert, she's not
a little girl anymore.

830
01:03:28,851 --> 01:03:30,978
What are you reading?

831
01:03:33,730 --> 01:03:36,817
José Martí.

832
01:03:36,859 --> 01:03:37,985
It was my father's.

833
01:03:38,026 --> 01:03:42,114
We got rid of all his books
just to be safe, but...

834
01:03:42,156 --> 01:03:43,824
I kept this one.

835
01:03:45,159 --> 01:03:46,410
Hello.

836
01:03:47,536 --> 01:03:48,745
- Javier?
- Yeah?

837
01:03:50,914 --> 01:03:53,542
- If we don't win the finals--
- We will.

838
01:03:53,584 --> 01:03:56,044
But if we don't...

839
01:03:57,921 --> 01:04:00,007
I'm not gonna go to college
in six months.

840
01:04:03,927 --> 01:04:07,181
You don't know how
you're gonna feel in six months.

841
01:04:09,266 --> 01:04:10,517
Yes, I do.

842
01:04:12,436 --> 01:04:13,770
No, you don't.

843
01:04:15,230 --> 01:04:17,858
I don't want you
to give up your dreams for me.

844
01:04:17,900 --> 01:04:19,610
But I have new dreams now.

845
01:05:03,987 --> 01:05:06,615
Susie, why don't you and I go
raid that buffet by the pool?

846
01:05:06,657 --> 01:05:08,116
Sure.

847
01:05:20,379 --> 01:05:22,297
Tree looks nice.

848
01:05:28,679 --> 01:05:30,013
Your father and I
discussed it...

849
01:05:34,852 --> 01:05:37,104
and we think
that you should do...

850
01:05:37,146 --> 01:05:39,606
a double turn at the finals.

851
01:05:42,734 --> 01:05:44,194
You like the way I danced?

852
01:05:46,113 --> 01:05:48,907
Katey...

853
01:05:48,949 --> 01:05:52,619
if you're asking me to approve
of you and this boy, I can't.

854
01:05:52,619 --> 01:05:54,955
But the dancing...

855
01:05:57,833 --> 01:05:59,960
The dancing was incredible.

856
01:06:02,379 --> 01:06:04,965
I think I should take
a little credit for that.

857
01:06:06,884 --> 01:06:09,052
I think you should, too.

858
01:06:22,441 --> 01:06:23,734
- Hi!
- Hi!

859
01:06:25,277 --> 01:06:27,654
Javier, these are my parents.

860
01:06:27,654 --> 01:06:29,448
Hi, Javier.
It's nice to meet you.

861
01:06:29,490 --> 01:06:30,532
Nice to meet you, too.

862
01:06:30,574 --> 01:06:33,076
It's an honor to meet
such wonderful dancers.

863
01:06:33,118 --> 01:06:35,496
This is from my mother's garden.

864
01:06:35,496 --> 01:06:38,207
Thank you.
That was sweet of you.

865
01:06:38,248 --> 01:06:40,667
- This is for you.
- Thanks.

866
01:06:40,667 --> 01:06:43,003
- Shall we?
- Yeah.

867
01:06:43,545 --> 01:06:45,631
Tonight we bring you
the three winning couples...

868
01:06:45,672 --> 01:06:48,550
from the Latin ballroom
competition.

869
01:07:06,443 --> 01:07:08,779
Do you want to dance?

870
01:07:20,791 --> 01:07:22,084
Don't you dare!

871
01:07:48,652 --> 01:07:52,281
Feliz año nuevo,
ladies and gentlemen.

872
01:07:52,322 --> 01:07:57,786
Welcome to our Latin ballroom
amateur dance contest final.

873
01:08:02,416 --> 01:08:06,253
You will dance on the stage
one couple at a time.

874
01:08:06,295 --> 01:08:10,424
Tonight's winning couple
will win $5,000.

875
01:08:10,465 --> 01:08:13,093
You are up first.

876
01:08:13,135 --> 01:08:17,431
Our first couple this evening
is Mr. Jose Velarde...

877
01:08:17,473 --> 01:08:19,975
and Miss Iris Mesa!

878
01:08:52,758 --> 01:08:54,468
Don't forget
to look at the judges.

879
01:08:54,510 --> 01:08:56,345
Don't worry about the others.

880
01:08:56,386 --> 01:08:59,932
Remember, you're the queen
of La Rosa Negra.

881
01:09:01,225 --> 01:09:03,769
Our final contestants
this evening...

882
01:09:03,811 --> 01:09:07,397
Miss Katey Miller
and Mr. Javier Suarez.

883
01:10:07,249 --> 01:10:08,333
Sorry!

884
01:10:17,551 --> 01:10:19,136
He's got a gun!

885
01:10:19,178 --> 01:10:20,304
No!

886
01:10:28,896 --> 01:10:31,231
Go! I'll find you!

887
01:11:33,669 --> 01:11:35,128
No.

888
01:12:24,428 --> 01:12:26,513
Oye.

889
01:13:24,238 --> 01:13:28,700
¡Viva la revolución!

890
01:13:30,661 --> 01:13:32,579
Attention, all hotel guests.

891
01:13:32,621 --> 01:13:35,541
President Batista
has fled the country.

892
01:13:35,582 --> 01:13:39,795
There is no immediate danger.
Please contact the front desk...

893
01:14:07,573 --> 01:14:09,158
I can't believe it's real.

894
01:14:09,199 --> 01:14:11,618
Don't you wanna be
out there celebrating?

895
01:14:11,660 --> 01:14:15,164
No. I wanna be
right here with you.

896
01:15:22,731 --> 01:15:25,275
We didn't win the contest.

897
01:15:25,317 --> 01:15:27,736
No.

898
01:15:27,778 --> 01:15:30,781
But the consolation prize
was pretty good.

899
01:15:38,121 --> 01:15:42,042
I'm so happy
I can see all this with you.

900
01:15:50,050 --> 01:15:52,386
What?

901
01:15:52,386 --> 01:15:54,555
Nothing.

902
01:15:54,596 --> 01:15:56,223
Tell me.

903
01:15:58,851 --> 01:16:00,561
Carlos...

904
01:16:00,561 --> 01:16:04,148
he always said that
when the revolution came...

905
01:16:04,189 --> 01:16:07,401
Castro will kick out
all the Yankee companies.

906
01:16:09,945 --> 01:16:12,406
But you don't really know that.

907
01:16:12,406 --> 01:16:15,659
No. I'm just saying that...

908
01:16:15,701 --> 01:16:17,828
What, that I might
have to leave?

909
01:16:17,870 --> 01:16:20,747
It could happen.

910
01:16:20,747 --> 01:16:22,124
But they wouldn't do that...

911
01:16:22,166 --> 01:16:25,711
not if the whole idea
is to give people their freedom.

912
01:16:25,752 --> 01:16:27,504
Cuban people.

913
01:16:29,131 --> 01:16:31,884
Well, then,
you'll come with us.

914
01:16:31,925 --> 01:16:33,427
I'm sure my dad
can work it out.

915
01:16:33,469 --> 01:16:35,512
And my family?

916
01:16:35,554 --> 01:16:37,931
We'll send for them, just like
we were always gonna do.

917
01:16:37,973 --> 01:16:41,435
Katey, I wanted to leave
because of Batista, but now--

918
01:16:41,477 --> 01:16:43,270
But you don't know
what life will be like here.

919
01:16:43,312 --> 01:16:45,272
I mean, what if
it doesn't get better?

920
01:16:46,982 --> 01:16:49,067
My father died for this.

921
01:16:49,109 --> 01:16:51,153
I have to believe it will.

922
01:16:52,821 --> 01:16:55,073
I can make a difference here.

923
01:16:55,115 --> 01:16:56,825
You showed me that.

924
01:16:59,411 --> 01:17:02,206
This is my country.
It's my home.

925
01:17:10,214 --> 01:17:11,840
Oh, thank God.

926
01:17:11,882 --> 01:17:13,509
Katey, are you OK?

927
01:17:15,385 --> 01:17:17,137
We're leaving.

928
01:17:17,137 --> 01:17:19,515
Yeah. Your father's
making arrangements.

929
01:17:39,409 --> 01:17:41,662
Give me that comb.

930
01:17:43,831 --> 01:17:45,791
When you were little, you used
to hide under the bed...

931
01:17:45,833 --> 01:17:48,794
when I'd try
to comb out these knots.

932
01:17:56,009 --> 01:17:58,011
Katey, your father's been
the only man in my life...

933
01:17:58,053 --> 01:18:02,141
so I don't know what it's like
to say good-bye to someone.

934
01:18:02,182 --> 01:18:06,395
Saying good-bye to dancing,
the other love of my life...

935
01:18:09,356 --> 01:18:10,899
it broke my heart.

936
01:18:16,989 --> 01:18:18,991
Then you were born,
and then Susie...

937
01:18:19,032 --> 01:18:21,118
and I loved you both
so much that I--

938
01:18:21,160 --> 01:18:24,872
- You're saying I'll get over it.
- No, I'm not. No.

939
01:18:26,957 --> 01:18:29,126
No. I'm saying
I know you're hurting.

940
01:18:30,544 --> 01:18:32,421
Everything's such a mess.

941
01:18:34,631 --> 01:18:37,009
You have a choice.

942
01:18:37,050 --> 01:18:38,886
You can do nothing.

943
01:18:38,886 --> 01:18:42,222
You can hide under the bed...

944
01:18:42,264 --> 01:18:44,850
Or you can
work through the knots.

945
01:19:08,123 --> 01:19:09,750
I'm gonna miss you.

946
01:19:14,588 --> 01:19:16,256
I'm gonna miss you, too.

947
01:19:18,175 --> 01:19:21,011
I am taking you with me.

948
01:19:21,053 --> 01:19:23,806
I am keeping you here.

949
01:19:59,299 --> 01:20:01,135
Javier once said
that dancing...

950
01:20:01,135 --> 01:20:04,513
is about being exactly who
you wanna be in that moment.

951
01:20:04,555 --> 01:20:07,224
Dancing with him,
I realized I was becoming...

952
01:20:07,266 --> 01:20:10,102
exactly the woman
I wanted to be.

953
01:20:10,144 --> 01:20:11,645
We didn't win the contest...

954
01:20:11,687 --> 01:20:13,981
but we did win something
more important to us.

955
01:20:14,022 --> 01:20:15,816
On my last night in Havana...

956
01:20:15,858 --> 01:20:19,027
we were king and queen
of La Rosa Negra.

957
01:21:21,465 --> 01:21:23,884
We didn't know when
we would see each other again...

958
01:21:23,884 --> 01:21:26,970
but we knew that this
wasn't our last dance.
