- You don't understand okay. Uhm...I'm...

10
00:01:00,740 --> 00:01:02,040
I am confused

11
00:01:02,489 --> 00:01:05,268
I've been having these feelings but...

12
00:01:05,339 --> 00:01:08,749
but I know know that it's a sin
and that it's wrong

13
00:01:08,750 --> 00:01:12,250
but, look, you gotta promise
not to tell anyone, okay?

14
00:01:14,049 --> 00:01:16,099
- Where are you parents?
- What?

15
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:17,800
- Where are your parents?

16
00:01:22,299 --> 00:01:24,389
- What the fuck does that matter?

17
00:01:25,190 --> 00:01:28,190
They probably told the whole 
goddamn church about me

18
00:01:36,389 --> 00:01:37,989
- He did hit you again?

19
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:46,521
- It was my fault
-  No Jesse, it' s not your fault

20
00:01:46,559 --> 00:01:49,059
- I deserved it
- My dad, he can help

21
00:01:49,159 --> 00:01:50,509
- Don't you get it

22
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:55,780
He's already signed me up
for his correctional therapy

23
00:01:55,878 --> 00:01:57,118
- What?...What therapy?

24
00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:00,019
- You should know golden boy

25
00:02:00,863 --> 00:02:03,663
I'm gonna pop to the fucking pious

26
00:02:03,663 --> 00:02:07,296
He's gonna fix me with his Jesus powers

27
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:09,640
- Look Jesse, you're drunk,

28
00:02:09,841 --> 00:02:11,341
you're not thinking straight

29
00:02:11,342 --> 00:02:13,442
It's going to be okay,
I can tell

30
00:02:13,839 --> 00:02:15,379
- But you can't

31
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,180
I'm a freak

32
00:02:18,981 --> 00:02:20,381
- Don't!

33
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:34,090
- Listen, just listen
- No, it's gonna be okay.

34
00:02:34,091 --> 00:02:36,291
I'm calling someone for help
- No...I love you

35
00:02:40,249 --> 00:02:42,189
Don't hit me

36
00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:51,380
- No Jesse,

37
00:02:52,981 --> 00:02:54,981
I love you for you
