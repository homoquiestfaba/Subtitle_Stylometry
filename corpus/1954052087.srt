CHRONICLE OF A DISAPPEARANCE

3
00:02:47,534 --> 00:02:50,264
A Film by Elia Suleiman

4
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:53,305
PART I - NAZARETH
PERSONAL DIARY

5
00:02:53,406 --> 00:02:57,365
"The first morning home
after a long absence,

6
00:02:57,477 --> 00:03:00,344
I'm awakened by the clicking
of my aunt's heels.

7
00:03:00,446 --> 00:03:03,609
She's going with my mother
to pay condolences."

8
00:03:28,141 --> 00:03:30,905
No one's around, so let's talk...

9
00:03:31,010 --> 00:03:34,878
That stubborn woman refuses
to offer her condolences.

10
00:03:34,981 --> 00:03:38,883
I found her sulking on the balcony

11
00:03:38,985 --> 00:03:41,579
because she wasn't invited
to her granddaughter's wedding.

12
00:03:41,688 --> 00:03:45,681
Yet, her daughter-in-law was invited.
Now they hate each other.

13
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:49,091
Brothers, sisters, brothers
and sisters-in-law won't talk!

14
00:03:49,195 --> 00:03:52,358
They were friends,
but then she butted in.

15
00:03:52,465 --> 00:03:55,992
She says she wants to see a fortune-teller
about her grandchild's name.

16
00:03:56,102 --> 00:04:00,300
The girl's prone to accidents
and always gets ill.

17
00:04:01,441 --> 00:04:03,534
Her son was loaded with money,

18
00:04:03,643 --> 00:04:06,976
the richest of the brothers,
didn't know what to do with his cash.

19
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:09,446
Now it's getting worse and worse.

20
00:04:09,549 --> 00:04:11,346
She broke her nephew's engagement.

21
00:04:11,451 --> 00:04:14,545
His fianc?e was educated,
a schoolteacher, nice figure,

22
00:04:14,654 --> 00:04:17,282
sweet, beautiful eyes,
she even owns a car.

23
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:21,451
She works, saves money,
she's perfect, just slightly dark.

24
00:04:21,561 --> 00:04:24,359
And who is she, Snow White?

25
00:04:24,464 --> 00:04:27,922
She criticizes her health,
says her uncle and aunts died of cancer.

26
00:04:28,034 --> 00:04:31,299
Her mother bore many kids,
her father doted on her.

27
00:04:31,404 --> 00:04:36,137
3 handbags, 3 dresses, 3 pairs of shoes,
the engagement cost a fortune.

28
00:04:36,242 --> 00:04:39,302
She says she doesn't want a girl
from Shafr Amre. Say it before!

29
00:04:39,412 --> 00:04:44,042
Not after the engagement.
They spent a fortune, what a rip-off!

30
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:47,244
She said her first fianc?
kissed her a hundred times.

31
00:04:47,353 --> 00:04:52,222
So what, kisses fly away,
he didn't spoil her! To hell with her!

32
00:04:52,325 --> 00:04:54,225
Her sister's mourning isn't over,

33
00:04:54,327 --> 00:04:58,024
she wears makeup like a whore,
a ring on each finger!

34
00:04:58,131 --> 00:05:00,964
At the wedding, she danced with a scarf,
shaking her ass,

35
00:05:01,067 --> 00:05:03,627
as if it was gonna come off her body...

36
00:05:03,736 --> 00:05:06,762
She's got varicose veins
and sweated like a pig.

37
00:05:06,873 --> 00:05:10,309
Whenever she sat down,
she stuffed herself.

38
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:14,437
She wore a long blouse
to hide her fat hips.

39
00:05:14,547 --> 00:05:18,142
Rumors say she steals things
in other people's homes.

40
00:05:18,251 --> 00:05:20,151
No wonder her husband keeled over.

41
00:05:20,253 --> 00:05:24,155
Died in his armchair,
legs crossed, book on the floor.

42
00:05:24,257 --> 00:05:26,248
My heart broke.

43
00:05:26,359 --> 00:05:28,327
She should die, that bitch.

44
00:05:28,428 --> 00:05:32,455
I'd rather not talk about it.

45
00:07:05,191 --> 00:07:09,389
<i>The Voice of Israel from Jerusalem
Al-Qods. Five past seven...</i>

46
00:07:09,495 --> 00:07:11,053
- Put it away.
- Too late!

47
00:07:11,164 --> 00:07:13,792
- Don't bust my ass!
- Fuck off!

48
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:16,198
- Come on, drop it!
- No!

49
00:07:16,302 --> 00:07:17,701
Don't complicate things!

50
00:07:17,804 --> 00:07:20,568
- Don't listen to them!
- Don't take their money.

51
00:07:20,673 --> 00:07:22,231
- Let go!
- Calm down.

52
00:07:22,341 --> 00:07:23,638
Fine.

53
00:07:23,743 --> 00:07:27,042
I'll smash your teeth.

54
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:32,110
I said I'd pay and I will.

55
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:56,467
Check her.

56
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:09,614
Open her.

57
00:09:10,783 --> 00:09:12,546
Is it true that

58
00:09:12,652 --> 00:09:16,418
a guy from around Nazareth

59
00:09:16,589 --> 00:09:18,819
wrote his Ph.D. thesis

60
00:09:18,925 --> 00:09:22,520
on how a man pees?

61
00:09:22,628 --> 00:09:26,564
At the last few drops, he shivers

62
00:09:26,666 --> 00:09:28,896
and he shakes.

63
00:09:29,835 --> 00:09:34,704
To him, it proves man
descends from animals.

64
00:09:35,841 --> 00:09:38,867
He once had a tail...

65
00:09:39,912 --> 00:09:42,608
now it's gone.

66
00:09:43,783 --> 00:09:46,650
Yet, he keeps shaking his ass...

67
00:09:49,288 --> 00:09:51,779
as if he still had one.

68
00:09:51,891 --> 00:09:54,325
Is it true?

69
00:10:16,482 --> 00:10:18,313
Welcome back.

70
00:10:18,417 --> 00:10:20,408
Cheers.

71
00:10:25,057 --> 00:10:28,857
THE DAY AFTER

72
00:10:35,635 --> 00:10:37,967
Get out of the car.

73
00:10:41,774 --> 00:10:44,572
I shouldn't be ashamed?

74
00:10:44,677 --> 00:10:48,374
I'm never ashamed, buddy!

75
00:10:49,415 --> 00:10:53,351
- I'll show you.
- Me, I'm not ashamed?

76
00:11:05,464 --> 00:11:07,625
Let go.
I just want to talk to him.

77
00:11:07,733 --> 00:11:09,860
To say what?
Aren't you ashamed?

78
00:11:09,969 --> 00:11:12,665
You're friends.
You should be ashamed!

79
00:11:12,772 --> 00:11:14,535
Let go of my arm.

80
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:16,733
I'll show him!

81
00:11:21,881 --> 00:11:26,409
- Come on!
- Take your jack.

82
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:28,919
Goodbye.

83
00:12:12,231 --> 00:12:16,429
<i>About women and love.</i>

84
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:23,409
<i>Women shun those who love them,
if they don't love in return.</i>

85
00:12:29,014 --> 00:12:31,005
<i>For a woman, the voice of love</i>

86
00:12:31,117 --> 00:12:35,053
<i>is stronger than the voice of reason.</i>

87
00:12:40,459 --> 00:12:43,053
<i>To conclude, dear listeners,</i>

88
00:12:43,162 --> 00:12:45,722
<i>as they reach maturity,</i>

89
00:12:45,831 --> 00:12:48,356
<i>women get less reasonable.</i>

90
00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:54,234
Mother of Ramzi...

91
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:55,432
Come on in!

92
00:12:55,541 --> 00:12:57,668
"Come on in!"

93
00:12:59,812 --> 00:13:02,076
Don't peel the garlic so soon,
it gets yellow.

94
00:13:02,181 --> 00:13:06,618
I have plenty unpeeled.

95
00:13:06,719 --> 00:13:08,983
Nahla, get the garlic...

96
00:13:09,088 --> 00:13:14,185
- Shall I peel it?
- Don't peel it.

97
00:13:24,436 --> 00:13:28,600
They sell ready-to-use garlic in pots.

98
00:13:28,707 --> 00:13:33,235
You can find it in any shop.

99
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:36,771
20 shekels a kilo.

100
00:13:37,783 --> 00:13:40,047
I peel garlic once a week.

101
00:13:40,152 --> 00:13:43,679
She has nothing to do,
so she peels garlic!

102
00:13:43,789 --> 00:13:46,553
20 shekels, so what?

103
00:13:54,733 --> 00:13:55,927
THE DAY AFTER

104
00:13:56,035 --> 00:14:02,372
<i>For the Bosnian president, Holbrooke's
optimistic mood is encouraging.</i>

105
00:14:02,474 --> 00:14:07,275
<i>The chances of a truce grow nearer
as all parties are worn down</i>

106
00:14:07,379 --> 00:14:13,375
<i>and no one is winning the war.</i>

107
00:14:13,485 --> 00:14:16,010
<i>The division of the land
has been reviewed:</i>

108
00:14:16,121 --> 00:14:20,888
<i>61% to the Muslims and the Croatians,</i>

109
00:14:20,993 --> 00:14:26,431
<i>49% to the Serbs,
according to the new agreements.</i>

110
00:14:26,532 --> 00:14:31,231
<i>Alexander Ivanko,</i>

111
00:14:31,337 --> 00:14:34,306
<i>spokesman for
the United Nations, says...</i>

112
00:14:34,406 --> 00:14:37,239
<i>The main thing is that both parties</i>

113
00:14:37,343 --> 00:14:39,709
<i>agree to end the fighting
and this tragedy.</i>

114
00:14:39,812 --> 00:14:45,011
<i>But this optimism may not last,</i>

115
00:14:45,117 --> 00:14:48,746
<i>as many previous agreements
were violated</i>

116
00:14:48,854 --> 00:14:50,344
<i>during the Bosnian war.</i>

117
00:14:50,456 --> 00:14:53,721
<i>In Algeria,
a booby-trapped car</i>

118
00:14:53,826 --> 00:15:00,061
<i>has killed 9 people
and injured 19 others.</i>

119
00:15:01,533 --> 00:15:06,630
<i>The bomb went off in front of a hotel
in Dra Benkhada...</i>

120
00:17:03,722 --> 00:17:06,384
Charge!

121
00:17:06,492 --> 00:17:08,858
Nice shot!

122
00:17:13,465 --> 00:17:15,296
Go for it, kid!

123
00:17:15,401 --> 00:17:19,667
Allah is great!

124
00:17:19,772 --> 00:17:22,673
- Abu Adnan, you're a master!
- Charge! Charge!

125
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:35,578
Stop!

126
00:17:42,094 --> 00:17:46,827
- Great shot.
- Smack in the middle!

127
00:17:51,036 --> 00:17:54,062
It's Oklahoma everywhere!

128
00:18:22,768 --> 00:18:25,202
Tell me, Jamal,
are you related to the Shekshirs?

129
00:18:25,304 --> 00:18:26,328
No.

130
00:18:26,438 --> 00:18:29,896
God damn the best
of the Shekshirs!

131
00:18:35,547 --> 00:18:37,742
- And to the Abu Sallams?
- Not at all.

132
00:18:37,850 --> 00:18:42,184
God damn the Sallams
and the Abu Sallams, they're vile!

133
00:18:48,293 --> 00:18:50,557
- What about the El Sutalis?
- No.

134
00:18:50,662 --> 00:18:53,256
God damn them all!

135
00:18:53,365 --> 00:18:58,428
I'll fuck the best in the family,
one by one. Wait and see.

136
00:19:00,639 --> 00:19:03,870
- What about the Mer'ebs?
- With those, yes.

137
00:19:03,976 --> 00:19:08,345
The Mer'ebs deserve
the greatest respect.

138
00:19:08,447 --> 00:19:10,540
Good people.

139
00:19:10,649 --> 00:19:12,583
Really good people.

140
00:19:12,684 --> 00:19:16,450
They're the best, I swear to God.

141
00:19:16,555 --> 00:19:19,422
- Are they really related to you?
- Yes, yes.

142
00:19:19,525 --> 00:19:21,789
God bless families like that!

143
00:19:21,894 --> 00:19:25,386
Nothing can be said against them!

144
00:19:33,505 --> 00:19:37,168
THE DAY AFTER

145
00:20:51,049 --> 00:20:52,676
No!

146
00:20:52,784 --> 00:20:54,376
Don't do it!

147
00:20:59,424 --> 00:21:01,551
Is he your son or not?

148
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:04,823
He's not your father?

149
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:09,424
What's the matter with you?
Calm down!

150
00:21:14,072 --> 00:21:17,371
You fight with your own son?

151
00:21:17,476 --> 00:21:19,706
Drive carefully.

152
00:21:41,833 --> 00:21:44,563
Put the gear on neutral.

153
00:21:48,206 --> 00:21:50,504
<i>Take off the hand brake.</i>

154
00:21:52,644 --> 00:21:55,306
DAYS WENT BY

155
00:25:39,771 --> 00:25:43,138
THE DAY AFTER

156
00:27:36,221 --> 00:27:39,384
THE DAY AFTER

157
00:28:32,844 --> 00:28:38,248
APPOINTMENT WITH THE PRIEST

158
00:29:00,505 --> 00:29:04,805
That's where Jesus is said
to have walked over water.

159
00:29:04,909 --> 00:29:10,176
Now it's a gastronomic sewer,
filled with excrement,

160
00:29:10,281 --> 00:29:12,181
shit of American
and German tourists

161
00:29:12,283 --> 00:29:14,376
who eat Chinese food.

162
00:29:14,486 --> 00:29:17,580
It forms a crust
on the surface of the lake.

163
00:29:17,689 --> 00:29:22,649
Anyone can walk over water
and make miracles now.

164
00:29:22,761 --> 00:29:26,822
I'm encircled by giant buildings
and kibbutzes.

165
00:29:26,931 --> 00:29:30,560
As if that wasn't enough,
my collar's choking me.

166
00:29:30,668 --> 00:29:34,365
An odd bond unites me to those people,

167
00:29:34,472 --> 00:29:39,409
like an arranged marriage,
with this lake as wedding ring.

168
00:29:39,511 --> 00:29:42,810
Not long ago, those hills were deserted.

169
00:29:42,914 --> 00:29:46,680
At night, when I gazed at the hills
from the monastery,

170
00:29:46,785 --> 00:29:49,185
I contemplated a particular spot,

171
00:29:49,287 --> 00:29:52,085
the darkest one on the hills.

172
00:29:52,190 --> 00:29:54,181
Fear would grab me,

173
00:29:54,292 --> 00:29:57,819
a fear with a religious feeling.

174
00:29:57,929 --> 00:30:02,764
As if that black spot
were the source of my faith.

175
00:30:02,867 --> 00:30:07,668
Then, they settled on those hills
and illuminated the whole place.

176
00:30:07,772 --> 00:30:10,764
That was the end for me.

177
00:30:10,875 --> 00:30:12,399
I began losing faith.

178
00:30:12,510 --> 00:30:14,774
I feared nothing any longer.

179
00:30:14,913 --> 00:30:17,279
Now, my world is small.

180
00:30:17,382 --> 00:30:22,149
They've expanded their world
and mine has shrunk.

181
00:30:22,253 --> 00:30:25,416
There's no longer
a spot of darkness out there.

182
00:30:50,782 --> 00:30:53,774
Now, I will tell you a story,

183
00:30:53,885 --> 00:30:56,479
a story that could be made
into a film.

184
00:30:56,588 --> 00:30:57,748
APPOINTMENT WITH THE WRITER

185
00:30:57,856 --> 00:31:02,486
I visited Grandpa who was
in the Turkish army for 3 years.

186
00:31:02,594 --> 00:31:06,860
"Grandpa, tell me a story
about Istanbul."

187
00:31:06,965 --> 00:31:08,455
"Listen, grandson,

188
00:31:08,566 --> 00:31:12,764
I'll tell you a story you'll never forget.

189
00:31:12,871 --> 00:31:17,535
We were stationed
15 minutes away from Istanbul.

190
00:31:17,642 --> 00:31:20,406
At lunch, the lentils
were full of black worms.

191
00:31:20,511 --> 00:31:24,345
I had five coins
and was fed up with the worms.

192
00:31:24,449 --> 00:31:29,250
I crossed the street,
went by a bookshop, a clothes shop,

193
00:31:29,354 --> 00:31:31,322
and reached a public garden.

194
00:31:31,422 --> 00:31:35,256
There, a man with sparkling pans,

195
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:40,525
cooked lamb heads, nicely spiced,
with saffron and all.

196
00:31:40,632 --> 00:31:44,193
He'd serve me a head
in two hot loaves of bread.

197
00:31:44,302 --> 00:31:46,998
I'd sit on the nearest bench, eat,

198
00:31:47,105 --> 00:31:49,972
throw the remains in the bin
and go home.

199
00:31:50,074 --> 00:31:52,872
The beauty of Istanbul
is beyond compare."

200
00:31:52,977 --> 00:31:56,276
Three or four years later,
I went to grandpa and asked:

201
00:31:56,381 --> 00:31:58,144
"Tell me a story about Istanbul?"

202
00:31:58,249 --> 00:32:01,218
I thought he'd tell me a story

203
00:32:01,319 --> 00:32:05,085
with young people, adventure,
and a tall green-eyed girl...

204
00:32:05,189 --> 00:32:08,522
He said: "Here's a story
you'll never forget.

205
00:32:08,626 --> 00:32:13,859
Istanbul is the flower of all cities,
it's unique.

206
00:32:13,965 --> 00:32:17,492
We were stationed 15 minutes
away from Istanbul.

207
00:32:17,602 --> 00:32:20,332
At noon, lentils with worms,
I couldn't eat.

208
00:32:20,438 --> 00:32:25,068
Had five coins, crossed the street,
passed bookshop, clothes shop

209
00:32:25,176 --> 00:32:28,942
and reached the garden
where a man dressed in white

210
00:32:29,047 --> 00:32:34,075
with sparkling pans, gave me a lamb's head
with pepper and saffron.

211
00:32:34,185 --> 00:32:35,880
I'd sit on a bench and eat."

212
00:32:35,987 --> 00:32:39,150
Days went by
and his story wouldn't change.

213
00:32:39,257 --> 00:32:41,555
Then, when we left town,

214
00:32:41,659 --> 00:32:44,492
they went to Lebanon
and we stayed in Nazareth.

215
00:32:44,595 --> 00:32:49,623
After the Israeli invasion,
Grandpa was allowed to visit us.

216
00:32:49,734 --> 00:32:53,170
He'd grown old,
we were glad to see him.

217
00:32:53,271 --> 00:32:58,004
I went close to him,
after the welcoming and the tears:

218
00:32:58,109 --> 00:33:00,441
"Grandpa,
tell me a story about Istanbul."

219
00:33:00,545 --> 00:33:02,809
He nodded and I looked into his eyes.

220
00:33:02,914 --> 00:33:05,382
Human eyes never change.

221
00:33:05,483 --> 00:33:09,180
Everything about him had changed,
but not his eyes.

222
00:33:09,287 --> 00:33:13,917
He said: "I'll tell you about Istanbul,
the flower of the world.

223
00:33:14,025 --> 00:33:18,155
We were stationed 15 minutes
from Istanbul.

224
00:33:18,262 --> 00:33:21,390
At noon the food was full of worms.

225
00:33:21,499 --> 00:33:23,023
I had five coins.

226
00:33:23,134 --> 00:33:26,001
I didn't touch the food,
went by the bookshop,

227
00:33:26,104 --> 00:33:30,006
the clothes shop,
into the garden where the man

228
00:33:30,108 --> 00:33:35,239
with sparkling pans made lamb heads
with pepper, saffron and nutmeg.

229
00:33:35,346 --> 00:33:39,908
I'd eat it with hot bread
and throw the wastes in a bin...

230
00:33:40,018 --> 00:33:42,486
Listen, grandson,
nothing compares to Istanbul.

231
00:33:42,587 --> 00:33:44,680
Istanbul is the flower of all cities."

232
00:33:44,789 --> 00:33:48,657
TEL AVIV - A STROLL ALONG THE BEACH

233
00:34:20,825 --> 00:34:25,785
THE DAY AFTER

234
00:36:28,219 --> 00:36:30,278
It's raining culture.

235
00:38:44,722 --> 00:38:48,351
PART II - JERUSALEM
POLITICAL DIARY

236
00:38:58,602 --> 00:39:02,197
<i>Why do we fight?
We were friends once</i>

237
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:07,734
<i>Why do we fight?
We were friends once</i>

238
00:39:07,845 --> 00:39:12,179
<i>Listen to your heart
And you'll hear the truth</i>

239
00:39:12,283 --> 00:39:16,811
<i>Listen to your heart
It holds the truth</i>

240
00:39:16,921 --> 00:39:21,483
<i>We've come a long way, you and I</i>

241
00:39:21,592 --> 00:39:25,084
<i>Why do we fight?
We were friends once</i>

242
00:39:26,130 --> 00:39:30,328
<i>Why do we fight?
We were friends once</i>

243
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:06,732
<i>In love, there is peace</i>

244
00:40:11,776 --> 00:40:15,974
<i>If there is peace, there is love</i>

245
00:40:21,018 --> 00:40:25,421
<i>Come, let's be friends again</i>

246
00:40:25,523 --> 00:40:28,890
<i>We are brothers</i>

247
00:40:55,219 --> 00:41:00,316
There's a reality here
which is extremely difficult to grasp,

248
00:41:00,424 --> 00:41:06,192
now topped by a fascinating
new dimension.

249
00:41:06,297 --> 00:41:09,027
A STOP AT THE AMERICAN COLONY
People here can't stand one another.

250
00:41:09,133 --> 00:41:13,627
Never forget
this is a land of conflicts

251
00:41:13,804 --> 00:41:15,237
since the beginning.

252
00:41:15,339 --> 00:41:18,035
- Without going back...
- You must.

253
00:41:18,142 --> 00:41:22,135
Everybody does here.
It's an age-old problem.

254
00:41:22,246 --> 00:41:26,239
This has been a land of conflicts
for thousands of years.

255
00:41:26,350 --> 00:41:31,720
- There's never been a period of...
- It was never peaceful. Never.

256
00:41:31,822 --> 00:41:35,918
Think about it,
if you mix these different approaches,

257
00:41:36,026 --> 00:41:40,429
sociological, historical and religious,

258
00:41:40,531 --> 00:41:44,558
you get an abstract

259
00:41:44,668 --> 00:41:46,863
of the most complex situations

260
00:41:46,971 --> 00:41:49,906
now on this planet.

261
00:41:50,007 --> 00:41:53,306
- That's what makes it interesting.
- Yes, but exhausting too.

262
00:41:53,410 --> 00:41:55,241
You end up totally confused.

263
00:41:55,346 --> 00:41:58,645
At first, I thought I understood.

264
00:41:58,749 --> 00:42:04,381
When you get here, you think
"there's that side to it and this side,"

265
00:42:04,488 --> 00:42:08,185
but the more you get to know
all the factors

266
00:42:08,292 --> 00:42:11,989
underlying such complex phenomena,

267
00:42:12,096 --> 00:42:14,929
the more you realize what a mess it is.

268
00:42:16,834 --> 00:42:19,302
Everything is political.
Nothing is innocent.

269
00:42:19,403 --> 00:42:24,306
Anything you do or say
will be interpreted.

270
00:42:24,408 --> 00:42:27,775
APPOINTMENT WITH AN ESTATE AGENT
TO RENT A FLAT IN EAST JERUSALEM

271
00:42:32,550 --> 00:42:35,314
Think of me as your father.

272
00:42:35,419 --> 00:42:40,652
We are Arabs. We have our traditions.
If a girl wants to study,

273
00:42:40,758 --> 00:42:42,817
she should stay with her parents

274
00:42:42,927 --> 00:42:45,794
until she marries,
so her honor is safe.

275
00:42:45,896 --> 00:42:48,694
You, God bless you,
you're tall and pretty,

276
00:42:48,799 --> 00:42:50,323
you're 20 or 22.

277
00:42:50,434 --> 00:42:52,061
What more do you want?

278
00:42:52,169 --> 00:42:56,299
Get married and live your own way.
Study but be protected.

279
00:42:56,407 --> 00:43:00,503
Young men are modern.
They study, let their wives study.

280
00:43:00,611 --> 00:43:05,207
But you girls
are taking it upside down.

281
00:43:07,017 --> 00:43:08,746
Believe me, I care.

282
00:43:08,852 --> 00:43:11,252
I instantly took a liking to you.

283
00:43:11,355 --> 00:43:14,051
You're a nice girl, well bred,

284
00:43:14,158 --> 00:43:16,524
and very pretty too.

285
00:43:24,602 --> 00:43:26,661
I'm worried about you.

286
00:43:28,205 --> 00:43:30,264
I have room for many a friend.

287
00:43:30,374 --> 00:43:34,071
Everybody knows
and respects me here, you know.

288
00:43:34,178 --> 00:43:35,372
So?

289
00:43:43,253 --> 00:43:45,778
<i>- Is it still available?
- Who's speaking?</i>

290
00:43:45,889 --> 00:43:50,349
My name is Adan.
I'm calling about the flat for rent.

291
00:43:50,461 --> 00:43:52,486
<i>Eden, nice name.
What kind of a name is it?</i>

292
00:43:52,596 --> 00:43:53,688
Arabic.

293
00:43:53,797 --> 00:43:55,424
<i>Really? You don't sound like it.</i>

294
00:43:55,532 --> 00:43:59,093
<i>- Thanks. Is the flat still for rent?
- No. I'm sorry Adan.</i>

295
00:44:03,107 --> 00:44:06,042
<i>- Concerning the flat, is...
- Yes. Who's talking?</i>

296
00:44:06,143 --> 00:44:09,635
Adan. I'm from the east of the city,
if that tells you anything.

297
00:44:09,747 --> 00:44:12,011
<i>Hello, Adan.
Your Hebrew is very good.</i>

298
00:44:12,116 --> 00:44:14,277
<i>- Is the flat still for rent?
- Yes and no.</i>

299
00:44:14,385 --> 00:44:17,616
<i>Actually it is,
but the decision is not up to me.</i>

300
00:44:17,721 --> 00:44:19,086
Can I see it?

301
00:44:19,189 --> 00:44:21,555
<i>Listen, I know it's hard for you.</i>

302
00:44:21,659 --> 00:44:24,526
<i>You sound nice.
I wish I could help,</i>

303
00:44:24,628 --> 00:44:26,926
<i>but I doubt it'll work out.</i>

304
00:44:31,702 --> 00:44:33,533
Shalom. Concerning the flat...

305
00:44:33,637 --> 00:44:37,266
<i>Yes, it's still available,
but I'm busy.</i>

306
00:44:37,374 --> 00:44:38,636
This evening then?

307
00:44:38,742 --> 00:44:42,644
<i>No, the owner's religious.
He keeps the Sabbath.</i>

308
00:44:42,746 --> 00:44:46,273
Tell me, would he have a problem
renting to an Arab?

309
00:44:46,383 --> 00:44:48,851
<i>Yes, he's got kids.
Another vision of the world.</i>

310
00:44:48,952 --> 00:44:51,716
<i>He intends to bring them up
his own way.</i>

311
00:44:51,822 --> 00:44:55,189
<i>- Concerning the flat...
- At last, a Russian who speaks Hebrew</i>

312
00:44:55,292 --> 00:44:57,590
<i>What's your name?</i>

313
00:44:57,695 --> 00:44:59,856
<i>- Not Russian.
- Not Russian?</i>

314
00:44:59,963 --> 00:45:02,693
<i>But what's that accent of yours?</i>

315
00:45:03,367 --> 00:45:05,801
<i>- The Country Agency, shalom.
- Shalom. Concerning the flat...</i>

316
00:45:05,903 --> 00:45:09,134
<i>Too late, sweetheart.
But I've got a better one.</i>

317
00:45:09,239 --> 00:45:13,266
Wait, there's something you should know.

318
00:45:13,377 --> 00:45:18,314
<i>- So why not live on the east side?
- My business. You're an agency or what?</i>

319
00:45:18,415 --> 00:45:20,440
<i>- Listen, you sound...
- Nice?</i>

320
00:45:20,551 --> 00:45:21,813
<i>- You don't sound...
- Arabic?</i>

321
00:45:21,919 --> 00:45:24,649
<i>- Why not come by?
- To see if I don't look like one?</i>

322
00:45:26,824 --> 00:45:30,419
Shalom.
Concerning the flat. I'm Adan.

323
00:45:30,527 --> 00:45:33,223
<i>- Adan? What sort of name is that?
- Why?</i>

324
00:45:33,330 --> 00:45:35,355
<i>- It's not Jewish, is it?
- No.</i>

325
00:46:07,264 --> 00:46:10,597
I MOVED TO JERUSALEM
TO BE CLOSER TO THE AIRPORT

326
00:46:16,473 --> 00:46:21,206
I MOVED TO A NEW SPACE
TO HAVE MORE TIME

327
00:46:37,127 --> 00:46:40,028
THE DAY AFTER

328
00:48:05,382 --> 00:48:10,410
THE HIDDEN CONSCIENCE
OF ESTIMATED PALESTINE

329
00:48:18,262 --> 00:48:20,958
I'd like to introduce
film director Elia Suleiman

330
00:48:21,064 --> 00:48:24,397
back from his voluntary exile
in New York.

331
00:48:24,501 --> 00:48:28,733
He chose his homeland
for his new film about the peace.

332
00:48:28,839 --> 00:48:32,832
We'll ask him to tell us about
his film's subject,

333
00:48:32,943 --> 00:48:35,844
his narrative technique

334
00:48:35,946 --> 00:48:40,974
and the cinematographic language
he'll be using.

335
00:49:40,911 --> 00:49:42,538
What's up?

336
00:49:42,646 --> 00:49:45,479
Just having dinner
with some friends.

337
00:49:48,085 --> 00:49:49,814
Want to join us?

338
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:55,586
Now I'm busy.
I'll call you back.

339
00:49:55,692 --> 00:49:57,319
Have you got the money?

340
00:50:54,251 --> 00:50:57,414
<i>One calling Sorrel. Over.</i>

341
00:50:57,521 --> 00:50:58,818
<i>Sorrel speaking.</i>

342
00:50:58,922 --> 00:51:00,890
<i>Read you. Over.</i>

343
