1
00:04:13,598 --> 00:04:15,896
There's just nothing down there.

2
00:04:16,101 --> 00:04:19,366
I haven't seen a building
in, like, 20 minutes.

3
00:04:20,005 --> 00:04:23,133
-Look at that.
-We're not on vacation, Hap.

4
00:04:23,408 --> 00:04:25,467
Cheer up, will you?

5
00:04:25,677 --> 00:04:27,668
Tell that to her, partner.

6
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:31,508
Better hang on, guys.
It's gonna get rough.

7
00:05:07,519 --> 00:05:09,987
Detective Eckhart,
Detective Ellie Burr.

8
00:05:10,155 --> 00:05:11,884
-Hi.
-Nice to meet you.

9
00:05:12,057 --> 00:05:13,422
How are you doing?

10
00:05:13,592 --> 00:05:16,527
"Halibut fishing capital
of the world." Okay.

11
00:05:17,162 --> 00:05:20,063
Detective Dormer,
it's an honor to meet you.

12
00:05:20,232 --> 00:05:23,497
Welcome to Nightmute.
I got the car right here.

13
00:05:36,381 --> 00:05:39,612
It's so incredible
to be working with you.

14
00:05:39,784 --> 00:05:44,721
I've followed all of your cases:
Theodore Dineli, Frank Prud'homme...

15
00:05:44,923 --> 00:05:50,520
...the Ocean Park shootings and
especially the Leland Street murders.

16
00:05:50,729 --> 00:05:55,063
Is that where Ronald Langley cut you,
at 325 Leland Street?

17
00:05:55,233 --> 00:05:56,928
You did your homework.

18
00:05:57,102 --> 00:06:00,970
The Leland Street murders was
my case study at the academy.

19
00:06:01,139 --> 00:06:05,576
-I'll take you to the Lodge and--
-No, take us to the station.

20
00:06:06,011 --> 00:06:08,206
Right. We need to get started.

21
00:06:08,413 --> 00:06:11,849
Most homicides are solved
in the first 72 hours.

22
00:06:12,017 --> 00:06:15,817
Well, it's 48 hours.
We're a day behind.

23
00:06:15,987 --> 00:06:18,046
But who's counting?

24
00:06:28,366 --> 00:06:29,594
Yeah, come in.

25
00:06:29,768 --> 00:06:34,296
They got you behind a desk, huh?
Charlie Bubbles. How you doing?

26
00:06:34,506 --> 00:06:38,169
-I haven't seen you since when?
-Hey, Charlie.

27
00:06:38,343 --> 00:06:39,935
-Seven years?
-Eight.

28
00:06:40,111 --> 00:06:44,571
Seven years! I am old.
Ellie, get everyone in the bullpen.

29
00:06:45,050 --> 00:06:47,814
-Nice kid.
-Loves the job.

30
00:06:49,054 --> 00:06:54,890
When I called Buck for advice on this,
I never expected he'd send you up here.

31
00:06:55,827 --> 00:06:59,923
-Something about lnternal Affairs?
-They're moving in.

32
00:07:00,098 --> 00:07:05,126
It's nothing. It's the usual crap.
Buck figured you could use some help--

33
00:07:05,303 --> 00:07:07,863
They got Finn and Kentor on Narcotics.

34
00:07:08,039 --> 00:07:10,599
The fuckers are looking
for headlines--

35
00:07:10,775 --> 00:07:15,007
-It's gonna blow over.
-Got a message from Warfield.

36
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:16,772
I.A.'s pit bull.

37
00:07:16,948 --> 00:07:20,111
He wants to be posted
on your movements.

38
00:07:20,485 --> 00:07:22,885
You'll find us more straightforward.

39
00:07:23,088 --> 00:07:28,048
Good guys, bad guys, but a lot
less public relations. It's simple.

40
00:07:29,894 --> 00:07:32,089
Except for this.

41
00:07:32,931 --> 00:07:36,731
Okay, listen up.
Detectives Dormer and Eckhart...

42
00:07:36,901 --> 00:07:39,995
...on loan from Buck Lundgard,
L.A. Homicide.

43
00:07:40,171 --> 00:07:42,469
They'll help with the Connell case.

44
00:07:42,674 --> 00:07:47,702
Anything they want to see, show them.
Anyplace they want to go, take them.

45
00:07:47,879 --> 00:07:51,371
This is Fred Duggar.
He's heading the investigation.

46
00:07:51,549 --> 00:07:53,608
-A pleasure.
-Want to get on it?

47
00:07:53,785 --> 00:07:56,219
-Seen what we got?
-Let's start with the body.

48
00:07:56,388 --> 00:07:59,323
-You got the report?
-I want to see for myself.

49
00:08:01,893 --> 00:08:05,852
Herniation of the brain stem
due to intracerebral hemorrhage.

50
00:08:06,031 --> 00:08:09,592
-Beaten to death.
-These contusions?

51
00:08:09,768 --> 00:08:14,262
Superficial. Most of the trauma
was to her face and neck.

52
00:08:15,507 --> 00:08:17,975
-Any signs of rape?
-No.

53
00:08:18,143 --> 00:08:22,603
-This one covers an older bruise.
-There's an older one here.

54
00:08:22,781 --> 00:08:26,717
-They're both in the report.
-He washed her hair.

55
00:08:32,590 --> 00:08:34,421
Scrubbed her nails.

56
00:08:35,927 --> 00:08:37,895
It's all in the report.

57
00:08:38,063 --> 00:08:42,159
-Doesn't say he clipped them.
-She could have clipped them.

58
00:08:42,333 --> 00:08:45,860
Nope. No polish on the ends
of the nails. See?

59
00:08:46,371 --> 00:08:51,434
She painted them herself.
Someone else cut them. Toes too.

60
00:08:52,911 --> 00:08:56,779
-Naked when found?
-Yeah. Last seen wearing a red dress.

61
00:08:56,948 --> 00:08:58,882
No fibers, flakes, hairs?

62
00:08:59,050 --> 00:09:03,248
We know about forensics work here.
The body gave us nothing.

63
00:09:03,421 --> 00:09:09,758
She gave us plenty.
All this trouble, all this care. Why?

64
00:09:11,930 --> 00:09:16,731
-He knew her.
-He knows we can connect him to her.

65
00:09:16,901 --> 00:09:19,870
This isn't a random psycho?
Crime of passion?

66
00:09:20,038 --> 00:09:25,476
Maybe. But whatever happened,
his reaction wasn't passionate.

67
00:09:25,643 --> 00:09:29,010
He didn't panic.
Didn't chop her up or burn her.

68
00:09:29,214 --> 00:09:33,116
He just thought about
what we would be looking for...

69
00:09:33,284 --> 00:09:37,448
...and then calmly removed
all those traces.

70
00:09:37,622 --> 00:09:40,682
No haste. No rush.

71
00:09:40,859 --> 00:09:44,022
Why clip the nails
after scrubbing them?

72
00:09:44,229 --> 00:09:47,528
Manipulating the body.
Prolonging the moment.

73
00:09:47,699 --> 00:09:49,792
No mutilation.

74
00:09:50,268 --> 00:09:51,530
Not this time.

75
00:09:52,003 --> 00:09:55,370
-You think there's been others?
-No.

76
00:09:56,708 --> 00:09:59,302
But there's gonna be. This guy...

77
00:09:59,777 --> 00:10:04,043
...he crossed the line
and he didn't even blink.

78
00:10:04,849 --> 00:10:07,340
You don't come back from that.

79
00:10:07,919 --> 00:10:11,616
Okay. Let's go find out who Kay was.

80
00:10:15,894 --> 00:10:19,921
Fred said not to touch anything,
so I haven't tidied up.

81
00:10:20,131 --> 00:10:23,692
She hates it when I go
into her room anyway.

82
00:10:25,403 --> 00:10:27,769
Thank you, Mrs. Connell.

83
00:10:37,115 --> 00:10:39,845
So she went to a party Friday night.

84
00:10:40,018 --> 00:10:44,751
Not exactly a party. It's a local dive
where the kids hang out.

85
00:10:44,923 --> 00:10:46,151
No diary?

86
00:10:46,324 --> 00:10:49,816
We didn't find one.
Her mom said she has a journal.

87
00:10:49,994 --> 00:10:53,521
Friends said she argued
with her boyfriend Friday.

88
00:10:53,698 --> 00:10:56,599
She stormed off just after midnight.

89
00:10:57,402 --> 00:10:59,097
She did, huh?

90
00:11:00,171 --> 00:11:02,332
This is interesting.

91
00:11:14,552 --> 00:11:16,543
Who is this?

92
00:11:16,754 --> 00:11:20,121
Tanya Francke, Kay's best friend.

93
00:11:20,558 --> 00:11:22,753
I want to talk to her.

94
00:11:23,027 --> 00:11:29,023
Who is Kay Connell? Who is she?
ls she popular or is she a loner?

95
00:11:29,234 --> 00:11:33,398
Did she like this town?
She want to bolt first chance she got?

96
00:11:33,571 --> 00:11:35,402
Did she have dreams?

97
00:11:35,607 --> 00:11:39,407
She knew this guy.
We know her, maybe we can know him.

98
00:11:39,611 --> 00:11:42,739
This is designer. This is expensive.

99
00:11:43,915 --> 00:11:46,645
-The boyfriend, Randy.
-Randy Stetz.

100
00:11:46,818 --> 00:11:49,309
-He could afford this?
-He's in school.

101
00:11:49,487 --> 00:11:51,717
-Mom didn't buy it.
-What are we thinking?

102
00:11:51,889 --> 00:11:55,222
I don't know, stepfather?
Any rich uncles?

103
00:11:55,393 --> 00:11:56,724
No.

104
00:11:58,696 --> 00:12:00,163
An admirer.

105
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,661
Yeah.

106
00:12:05,303 --> 00:12:08,636
-I want the boyfriend.
-I'll get him to the station.

107
00:12:08,806 --> 00:12:12,765
I want to go to the school.
Pull him out in front of friends.

108
00:12:12,944 --> 00:12:16,675
Catch him off guard.
It will get people talking.

109
00:12:16,848 --> 00:12:19,840
So how far away is the school?

110
00:12:22,487 --> 00:12:26,423
-It's 1 0:00, Detective Dormer.
-You bet.

111
00:12:26,924 --> 00:12:28,915
At night.

112
00:12:30,561 --> 00:12:32,756
So when does it get dark here?

113
00:12:32,930 --> 00:12:34,158
It doesn't.

114
00:12:35,333 --> 00:12:37,597
Not this time of year.

115
00:12:38,836 --> 00:12:42,101
Yeah, I heard about that.
How come you didn't know that, Hap?

116
00:12:50,515 --> 00:12:53,313
-Lower 48.
-Lower 48?

117
00:12:53,484 --> 00:12:55,952
Not from here.
Can tell by your walk.

118
00:12:56,354 --> 00:12:58,720
-How's that?
-Unsure.

119
00:12:59,123 --> 00:13:01,819
Dormer and Eckhart.
We have a reservation.

120
00:13:02,026 --> 00:13:06,827
Don't be fooled by my friend's
frivolous demeanor. He's all business.

121
00:13:07,899 --> 00:13:11,733
-Your restaurant still serving?
-Kitchen's about to close.

122
00:13:12,203 --> 00:13:14,296
We'll be quick. Thank you.

123
00:13:14,739 --> 00:13:15,728
Thanks.

124
00:13:16,607 --> 00:13:20,907
We got the Halibut Calabrese,
got the Halibut Olympian.

125
00:13:21,079 --> 00:13:23,479
-Keep going.
-Halibut Cajun style.

126
00:13:23,648 --> 00:13:26,913
I can't wait to see
what they got for dessert.

127
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:30,979
Natives are getting restless.

128
00:13:31,155 --> 00:13:33,885
-We gotta talk.
-No, we don't.

129
00:13:34,058 --> 00:13:36,322
-Just sit tight?
-Nothing's changed.

130
00:13:36,494 --> 00:13:37,688
Nothing's changed?

131
00:13:37,862 --> 00:13:42,595
What do you think we're doing
in the halibut capital of the world?

132
00:13:42,767 --> 00:13:44,826
Buck figured Charlie needed help.

133
00:13:45,002 --> 00:13:49,701
Buck figured l.A. would be coming
to me next, and he was right.

134
00:13:50,908 --> 00:13:54,742
Warfield had me in his office
for three hours yesterday.

135
00:13:55,446 --> 00:13:59,473
Hap, he's rattling your cage, pal.
That's all.

136
00:13:59,650 --> 00:14:05,111
Me and Trish talked it through,
and I'm sorry, I gotta cut a deal.

137
00:14:05,323 --> 00:14:08,815
-Don't say this shit to me.
-You won't be involved.

138
00:14:08,993 --> 00:14:10,961
I'm not? Of course I will.

139
00:14:11,129 --> 00:14:13,859
With your reputation,
he can't touch you.

140
00:14:14,031 --> 00:14:16,761
My reputation's the whole problem.

141
00:14:18,770 --> 00:14:24,106
You think Warfield gives a fuck
about you shaking down drug dealers?

142
00:14:24,275 --> 00:14:28,735
You think that will get him
his headlines? He needs the big fish.

143
00:14:28,913 --> 00:14:32,144
He's putting the squeeze
on you to get to me.

144
00:14:32,316 --> 00:14:36,047
-But you're clean, Will.
-I'm a good cop, yeah.

145
00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:41,590
But there's always something they
could use to get at your credibility.

146
00:14:41,759 --> 00:14:44,353
Have you any idea
what this is gonna do?

147
00:14:44,562 --> 00:14:49,829
Think about all my cases. All the cases
dependent on my word, my judgment.

148
00:14:50,034 --> 00:14:53,595
Those fuckers on the street.
That's what you're doing.

149
00:14:53,771 --> 00:14:57,298
They got nothing on you
because there's nothing to get.

150
00:14:57,875 --> 00:14:59,604
Dobbs.

151
00:15:01,746 --> 00:15:04,180
-What about Dobbs?
-That's different.

152
00:15:04,382 --> 00:15:05,610
It's different?

153
00:15:05,817 --> 00:15:08,581
Warfield doesn't want
Dobbs on the street.

154
00:15:08,786 --> 00:15:13,689
It's a house of cards. Once it starts,
it's just gonna tumble. All of it.

155
00:15:13,858 --> 00:15:16,383
That's a chance I gotta take, pal.

156
00:15:16,794 --> 00:15:19,160
-I got family.
-Don't give me that.

157
00:15:19,330 --> 00:15:22,299
Warfield made it clear.
I get probation.

158
00:15:22,467 --> 00:15:26,597
We're cops, man.
This is not about us.

159
00:15:26,904 --> 00:15:31,341
This is about all the people who
depend on us. People with families.

160
00:15:31,909 --> 00:15:34,673
I spent my life doing this. My life.

161
00:15:34,846 --> 00:15:39,613
You're gonna destroy it like that.
Why? Why?

162
00:15:39,784 --> 00:15:43,481
So some l.A. prick gets closer
to being chief of police?

163
00:15:43,654 --> 00:15:49,251
Or playing golf with the mayor
or whatever the fuck else he's after?

164
00:15:49,660 --> 00:15:51,685
You finished?

165
00:15:54,699 --> 00:15:57,259
Sorry, I gotta cut a deal.

166
00:15:59,537 --> 00:16:01,732
So, make any decisions?

167
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:06,474
-You do everything around here?
-After 1 1 , pretty much.

168
00:16:07,812 --> 00:16:10,508
Over to you, Will.
What are you having?

169
00:16:17,722 --> 00:16:20,156
I lost my appetite.

170
00:16:24,762 --> 00:16:26,730
Excuse me.

171
00:16:50,121 --> 00:16:51,418
Morning.

172
00:17:07,905 --> 00:17:13,468
-What kind of calls you get here?
-Mostly drinking-related problems.

173
00:17:13,678 --> 00:17:17,444
Domestic abuse, bar fights,
that sort of stuff.

174
00:17:17,615 --> 00:17:21,278
People here come to live
the way they want to...

175
00:17:21,452 --> 00:17:23,920
...so most people keep to themselves.

176
00:17:24,221 --> 00:17:27,952
Chief won't let me handle anything
over a misdemeanor.

177
00:17:28,125 --> 00:17:29,888
Don't knock misdemeanors.

178
00:17:30,061 --> 00:17:33,258
No, but it's such small stuff.
It's so boring.

179
00:17:33,431 --> 00:17:37,925
It's all about small stuff.
You know, small lies, small mistakes.

180
00:17:38,102 --> 00:17:43,972
People give themselves away same
in misdemeanors as in murder cases.

181
00:17:44,141 --> 00:17:48,737
It's just human nature.
Aren't you gonna write that down?

182
00:18:11,636 --> 00:18:15,094
Friends making you nervous?
They think you did it?

183
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:18,203
You killed her?

184
00:18:18,376 --> 00:18:22,369
-No smoking on the school premises.
-Did you love her?

185
00:18:24,181 --> 00:18:27,810
-Randy, did you love her?
-Sure, she was nice.

186
00:18:27,985 --> 00:18:33,116
She was nice. Wow.
That makes me all soft inside.

187
00:18:33,290 --> 00:18:35,850
Did it occur to you
she didn't love you?

188
00:18:36,027 --> 00:18:37,961
She loved me.

189
00:18:38,129 --> 00:18:41,587
-Wanted me every night.
-Probably to pass the time.

190
00:18:41,766 --> 00:18:47,762
Girl like Kay Connell, she was looking
for more than some loser. Right?

191
00:18:48,072 --> 00:18:50,131
What can I say? Love is blind.

192
00:18:50,307 --> 00:18:52,070
-Live on your own?
-His grandpa's.

193
00:18:52,243 --> 00:18:55,212
-No alibi for Friday?
-Didn't know I'd need one.

194
00:18:55,379 --> 00:18:59,008
-At the party what'd you fight about?
-Stuff. No big deal.

195
00:18:59,216 --> 00:19:02,447
-I heard it was a loud fight.
-I guess.

196
00:19:02,620 --> 00:19:05,851
-I heard it was pretty rough.
-It wasn't rough.

197
00:19:06,023 --> 00:19:11,086
Not like the other times.
Those times she wouldn't listen to you.

198
00:19:11,262 --> 00:19:13,526
Couldn't keep her mouth shut.

199
00:19:13,698 --> 00:19:17,156
-Keep fishing, man.
-We saw the bruises.

200
00:19:17,334 --> 00:19:19,393
They said she was beaten.

201
00:19:19,570 --> 00:19:23,734
Not those bruises. Come on.
The old bruises. Your bruises.

202
00:19:23,941 --> 00:19:27,377
I'm sick of this.
I haven't done anything wrong.

203
00:19:27,545 --> 00:19:29,137
You haven't?

204
00:19:30,581 --> 00:19:31,570
Fuck you!

205
00:19:31,749 --> 00:19:35,879
You're a prick in a leather jacket.
What the fuck do you know?

206
00:19:36,921 --> 00:19:38,286
Randy...

207
00:19:44,729 --> 00:19:48,460
...this whole thing you're doing,
this fuck-the-world act.

208
00:19:48,632 --> 00:19:52,864
It might work with your mom.
It might even work with local cops...

209
00:19:53,037 --> 00:19:56,598
...who know you enough to figure
you're too dumb to kill...

210
00:19:56,807 --> 00:20:00,709
...without leaving witnesses
and a signed confession.

211
00:20:00,878 --> 00:20:03,346
It ain't gonna work with me.

212
00:20:03,781 --> 00:20:08,548
Because I know things. You understand?

213
00:20:08,719 --> 00:20:12,416
I know you beat your girlfriend.

214
00:20:12,590 --> 00:20:15,320
I know she was seeing somebody else.

215
00:20:15,626 --> 00:20:21,622
Someone she might have gone to see
after she walked out on you Friday.

216
00:20:21,799 --> 00:20:25,963
Now are you gonna tell us
who that somebody might be?

217
00:20:26,137 --> 00:20:29,038
Or are you so fucking stupid...

218
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:34,906
...you're gonna leave yourself as the
last person to see Kay Connell alive?

219
00:20:38,449 --> 00:20:39,780
I don't know.

220
00:20:39,984 --> 00:20:41,747
You don't know.

221
00:20:42,186 --> 00:20:44,313
I couldn't get her to tell me.

222
00:20:54,398 --> 00:20:56,298
How hard did you try?

223
00:20:57,701 --> 00:20:59,828
Pretty hard.

224
00:21:18,189 --> 00:21:20,054
-You think he....
-No.

225
00:21:20,224 --> 00:21:22,624
How'd it go?
Find where this is from.

226
00:21:22,827 --> 00:21:25,762
Mrs. Connell and her
friends don't know.

227
00:21:25,963 --> 00:21:30,559
You try the jewelry stores?
Small things, remember?

228
00:21:30,734 --> 00:21:34,932
The second you're about to dismiss
something, think about it.

229
00:21:35,105 --> 00:21:37,232
Look at it again.

230
00:21:38,475 --> 00:21:40,773
Want me to write that down?

231
00:21:40,978 --> 00:21:43,344
No, I'll remember it.

232
00:21:54,058 --> 00:21:56,549
-Where was it?
-In a cabin on the beach.

233
00:21:56,727 --> 00:21:58,922
-It's Kay's?
-Her books are in it.

234
00:21:59,096 --> 00:22:00,893
-Kids found it.
-Cabin secured?

235
00:22:01,065 --> 00:22:03,329
-Francis is headed there.
-Stop him.

236
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:05,730
-Tell him to stay clear.
-Rich.

237
00:22:05,903 --> 00:22:08,428
Biology and Algebra.

238
00:22:08,606 --> 00:22:13,168
Let's find out who she studied with,
where she bought this.

239
00:22:15,212 --> 00:22:18,340
"Otherwise Engaged.
A J. Brody mystery."

240
00:22:18,515 --> 00:22:20,608
-Who reads this crap?
-I do.

241
00:22:20,784 --> 00:22:23,514
Read it. After it's dusted.

242
00:22:23,687 --> 00:22:28,215
Find anything that strikes you,
plot-wise, underlined passages.

243
00:22:28,392 --> 00:22:29,950
There it is. The diary.

244
00:22:30,127 --> 00:22:31,389
Every word.

245
00:22:34,632 --> 00:22:35,621
That's it.

246
00:22:35,799 --> 00:22:37,699
-I'll put it in evidence.
-No.

247
00:22:37,868 --> 00:22:39,130
Why?

248
00:22:39,336 --> 00:22:42,772
Call every radio station
from here to Anchorage.

249
00:22:42,940 --> 00:22:47,377
Tell them we're looking for
the bag Kay left the party with.

250
00:22:47,544 --> 00:22:50,980
-Get it on the air in the next hour.
-You got it.

251
00:22:51,148 --> 00:22:54,584
Fill that bag up with books
and put it back.

252
00:22:55,786 --> 00:23:00,223
Gonna eat this son of a bitch alive,
knowing he missed this.

253
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:07,922
You know something, Charlie?
Maybe this isn't such a hot idea.

254
00:23:08,265 --> 00:23:11,166
A guy picks up a bag,
don't make him guilty.

255
00:23:11,335 --> 00:23:12,563
Will, it's solid.

256
00:23:12,736 --> 00:23:17,969
I don't know. This kind of thing.
Maybe we do this by the numbers.

257
00:23:18,142 --> 00:23:20,770
-Come on.
-I.A.'s gonna be on my ass.

258
00:23:20,945 --> 00:23:25,644
I don't want this turning up in some
court when my rep's in the shit...

259
00:23:25,816 --> 00:23:28,842
-...and they're pulling apart my cases.
-Bullshit.

260
00:23:29,019 --> 00:23:31,715
What the fuck you care?!

261
00:23:36,860 --> 00:23:40,296
Someone beat a girl to death.
Your job is to find him.

262
00:23:40,464 --> 00:23:45,094
You're a cop, not a lawyer.
Don't let l.A. cut your balls off.

263
00:23:45,369 --> 00:23:47,963
Charlie's right, Will.

264
00:24:07,358 --> 00:24:10,327
OP 1 , this is OP 2.
We still got nothing.

265
00:24:10,694 --> 00:24:12,525
Yeah, it's nice. Light.

266
00:24:12,696 --> 00:24:15,995
All plastic except for the barrel.
Never rusts.

267
00:24:16,367 --> 00:24:18,494
What do you carry down in L.A.?

268
00:24:18,669 --> 00:24:20,796
-Smith & Wesson .45.
-Excellent.

269
00:24:20,971 --> 00:24:22,905
-Anything?
-No.

270
00:24:30,547 --> 00:24:36,213
-Maybe he doesn't listen to the radio.
-He prefers the voices in his head.

271
00:24:38,489 --> 00:24:40,047
Hey, Will?

272
00:24:51,235 --> 00:24:54,136
We have somebody moving
towards the cabin.

273
00:24:54,304 --> 00:24:57,671
Okay, fan out.
Nice and easy.

274
00:25:05,015 --> 00:25:06,505
Shit.

275
00:25:06,683 --> 00:25:07,741
Come on, go!

276
00:25:28,272 --> 00:25:29,466
Police!

277
00:25:30,674 --> 00:25:33,234
Police! Come out!

278
00:25:42,753 --> 00:25:43,947
Fuck!

279
00:25:45,089 --> 00:25:47,421
Down there, huh?

280
00:25:48,492 --> 00:25:50,653
Down to the water. Spread out!

281
00:25:50,828 --> 00:25:51,988
Go!

282
00:25:54,965 --> 00:25:56,262
Fuck it.

283
00:26:40,144 --> 00:26:41,509
Dormer!

284
00:26:56,260 --> 00:26:57,625
Hold it! Who's there?

285
00:27:01,532 --> 00:27:03,397
-You okay?
-I'm okay.

286
00:28:37,027 --> 00:28:39,325
-Will?
-Don't talk.

287
00:28:39,596 --> 00:28:41,621
-Will.
-Don't talk. Don't talk.

288
00:28:42,866 --> 00:28:44,424
-Here.
-You sh--

289
00:28:44,601 --> 00:28:45,795
You....

290
00:28:46,503 --> 00:28:47,936
You shot....

291
00:28:48,105 --> 00:28:52,166
I know. I couldn't see, Hap.
I couldn't see in the fog.

292
00:28:53,043 --> 00:28:54,476
You tried to....

293
00:28:54,645 --> 00:28:57,307
You tried to kill me? Fuck you.

294
00:28:58,015 --> 00:28:59,346
No, listen, Hap.

295
00:28:59,516 --> 00:29:03,475
-Listen to me now. No, no.
-Get away, get away!

296
00:29:03,654 --> 00:29:07,181
No, I couldn't see you in the fog.
I couldn't. I--

297
00:29:07,724 --> 00:29:09,749
I couldn't see you, Hap.

298
00:29:11,161 --> 00:29:12,526
Don't go. Come on.

299
00:29:32,916 --> 00:29:35,817
-Man down!
-Who's down?

300
00:29:38,889 --> 00:29:43,223
-Man down here!
-Spread out!

301
00:29:47,431 --> 00:29:51,162
Dormer! Where'd he go? Which way?

302
00:29:51,902 --> 00:29:54,393
Dormer! Which way?

303
00:29:55,172 --> 00:29:56,469
That way.

304
00:29:57,574 --> 00:29:58,939
Fuck.

305
00:30:10,387 --> 00:30:11,945
You gave chase.

306
00:30:12,122 --> 00:30:17,059
After you left Farrell,
you heard the killer's second shot.

307
00:30:17,227 --> 00:30:21,027
You ran down to the water.
You found Hap.

308
00:30:22,933 --> 00:30:24,025
Will?

309
00:30:24,868 --> 00:30:26,995
Is that what happened?

310
00:30:29,940 --> 00:30:31,840
-Did Hap say anything?
-Damn it!

311
00:30:32,008 --> 00:30:35,239
Why didn't I know about
the goddamn tunnel?

312
00:30:36,580 --> 00:30:40,141
You don't move on a suspect
without knowing his exits.

313
00:30:40,317 --> 00:30:43,286
There's a bunch of those
tunnels out there.

314
00:30:43,453 --> 00:30:46,013
Closed years ago
when they were mines.

315
00:30:46,189 --> 00:30:51,126
-I don't even know most of them myself.
-I had him, Charlie.

316
00:30:52,129 --> 00:30:54,620
As close as you are now.

317
00:30:54,965 --> 00:30:57,866
I could smell the son of a bitch.

318
00:31:00,003 --> 00:31:03,632
-And I blew it.
-There's no point in blaming yourself.

319
00:31:04,508 --> 00:31:08,968
-I fucked up everything.
-Don't come apart on me, understand?

320
00:31:09,146 --> 00:31:12,138
I need you to find this bastard.

321
00:31:12,816 --> 00:31:14,181
Yeah.

322
00:31:15,519 --> 00:31:19,114
-You wanted to see me?
-You're on Eckhart's shooting.

323
00:31:19,289 --> 00:31:23,282
But we know what happened,
and I'm on the Connell case.

324
00:31:23,460 --> 00:31:27,988
Anchorage wants to send someone.
I told them we can do it. Can't we?

325
00:31:28,298 --> 00:31:30,994
-Sure.
-Write it up. No Shakespeare.

326
00:31:31,301 --> 00:31:35,169
Just enough to fry this
son of a bitch longer. Right?

327
00:31:51,588 --> 00:31:53,112
Hello?

328
00:31:54,357 --> 00:32:00,125
Jenny, it's Will.
Can you put your mother on?

329
00:32:03,166 --> 00:32:04,497
Hello?

330
00:32:05,135 --> 00:32:08,002
Trish, it's Will.

331
00:32:08,171 --> 00:32:12,471
What's happened?
They won't tell me anything.

332
00:32:12,642 --> 00:32:14,132
It's Hap....

333
00:32:15,879 --> 00:32:17,938
Is he okay?

334
00:32:20,016 --> 00:32:22,280
No, he's gone, Trish.

335
00:32:22,452 --> 00:32:23,919
He's dead.

336
00:32:25,055 --> 00:32:26,386
What?

337
00:32:31,027 --> 00:32:33,894
Trish, I can't tell you
how sorry I am.

338
00:32:34,097 --> 00:32:37,225
What was he doing, Will?

339
00:32:37,434 --> 00:32:42,667
This guy killed a girl, and, so we....

340
00:32:43,940 --> 00:32:45,805
We had him....

341
00:32:46,009 --> 00:32:50,503
We found him and we had him cornered.
And then he ran and....

342
00:32:50,714 --> 00:32:52,375
Hap....

343
00:32:54,184 --> 00:32:56,243
I'm so sorry.

344
00:32:56,553 --> 00:32:59,078
-I'm just so sorry.
-Did he suffer?

345
00:33:00,524 --> 00:33:04,824
-No, I don't--
-Did he say anything?

346
00:33:10,433 --> 00:33:14,927
Well, when I found him he....

347
00:33:15,839 --> 00:33:17,397
He was peaceful.

348
00:33:18,708 --> 00:33:22,610
-Did you get him?
-No, no. Not yet.

349
00:33:22,779 --> 00:33:24,940
You find him.

350
00:33:25,415 --> 00:33:28,407
And when you do, don't arrest him.

351
00:33:29,052 --> 00:33:32,021
You understand me, Will Dormer?

352
00:33:32,188 --> 00:33:35,055
Don't you dare fucking arrest him!

353
00:33:35,725 --> 00:33:38,785
-Okay, Trish.
-You understand?

354
00:33:38,962 --> 00:33:40,293
Okay.

355
00:33:42,766 --> 00:33:44,996
Trish, listen.

356
00:33:45,402 --> 00:33:46,801
I'm--

357
00:35:04,180 --> 00:35:06,512
--was shot and killed this evening...

358
00:35:06,683 --> 00:35:10,210
...in an attempt to apprehend
a suspect in the murder...

359
00:35:10,387 --> 00:35:14,050
...of 17-year-old
local girl, Kay Connell.

360
00:35:15,458 --> 00:35:18,621
I'm sorry. It's been
on the radio for hours.

361
00:35:19,329 --> 00:35:22,389
We're not used to this
kind of stuff up here.

362
00:35:24,467 --> 00:35:28,733
He was standing right there.
Last night.

363
00:35:31,508 --> 00:35:33,772
I hope I was nice to him.

364
00:35:34,110 --> 00:35:36,044
He liked you.

365
00:37:47,844 --> 00:37:51,940
Detective? I'm sorry to bother you,
but could you just point...

366
00:37:52,148 --> 00:37:55,777
...to where you were
when you heard the second shot?

367
00:37:56,352 --> 00:37:59,116
Sorry to make you do this right now.

368
00:37:59,289 --> 00:38:02,053
That's all right.
You're doing your job.

369
00:38:02,225 --> 00:38:03,385
Where was l?

370
00:38:04,260 --> 00:38:05,352
-There.
-Thank you.

371
00:38:05,595 --> 00:38:08,655
No sign of Farrell's bullet yet, huh?

372
00:38:08,832 --> 00:38:12,199
No, we'll have the other
one for ballistics after...

373
00:38:12,669 --> 00:38:14,796
...the autopsy.

374
00:38:16,406 --> 00:38:18,499
I'm really sorry.

375
00:38:25,481 --> 00:38:27,346
-Clean through, huh?
-Yeah.

376
00:38:27,517 --> 00:38:30,213
Bullet got lost in the rocks, I guess.

377
00:38:30,420 --> 00:38:33,321
Well, better luck next time.

378
00:38:33,923 --> 00:38:35,254
You ever been shot?

379
00:38:35,458 --> 00:38:38,393
Yeah, I have.
Kind of itches, don't it?

380
00:38:39,696 --> 00:38:42,859
We gotta catch him.
Did you get a look at him?

381
00:38:43,433 --> 00:38:46,163
-When?
-When I left you.

382
00:38:46,336 --> 00:38:49,237
-You see anything?
-I was in a lot of pain...

383
00:38:49,405 --> 00:38:54,001
...and when I heard that second shot,
I kept my goddamn head down.

384
00:38:54,210 --> 00:38:55,768
Hey, I'm...

385
00:38:56,379 --> 00:38:58,438
...sorry about Detective Eckhart.

386
00:38:58,648 --> 00:39:00,843
Sorry about that megaphone.

387
00:39:01,284 --> 00:39:03,980
-Maybe if I hadn't--
-Farrell, listen.

388
00:39:04,187 --> 00:39:07,247
What were we doing
running around in the fog?

389
00:39:07,790 --> 00:39:11,419
We doing it for our health?
We were chasing someone.

390
00:39:11,995 --> 00:39:16,056
So anything that happened
on that beach is not your fault.

391
00:39:16,266 --> 00:39:19,429
That's the fault of one man
and one man only.

392
00:39:19,636 --> 00:39:23,037
And that's the man who beat
Kay Connell to death.

393
00:39:29,479 --> 00:39:32,277
At this point, Dormer
encountered Brooks.

394
00:39:32,448 --> 00:39:36,043
The suspect, obscured by fog,
shot Officer Brooks...

395
00:39:36,219 --> 00:39:38,881
...in the vastus externus
of the left thigh.

396
00:39:39,055 --> 00:39:41,922
You're Farrell.
You were shot in the leg.

397
00:39:42,091 --> 00:39:43,251
Come on, Ellie.

398
00:39:43,426 --> 00:39:45,485
When you get this,
get the cone.

399
00:39:47,196 --> 00:39:49,528
-This his blood?
-Ketchup maybe.

400
00:39:49,732 --> 00:39:52,257
Was he eating a hot dog?

401
00:39:56,940 --> 00:39:58,100
Anything he dropped...

402
00:40:00,677 --> 00:40:01,735
...you put in a bag.

403
00:40:01,911 --> 00:40:05,779
Cigarette butts, gum wrappers,
coins, anything.

404
00:40:05,949 --> 00:40:08,975
Suspect will often
leave something behind.

405
00:40:09,919 --> 00:40:10,908
Detective Dormer...

406
00:40:12,989 --> 00:40:15,685
...lost the suspect in the fog
then heard a shot...

407
00:40:15,858 --> 00:40:18,520
...coming from
a northeasterly direction.

408
00:40:19,362 --> 00:40:21,887
-He wasn't that way.
-How do you know?

409
00:40:22,065 --> 00:40:24,090
Because I saw him.

410
00:40:25,034 --> 00:40:27,696
-Turn this way.
-Are we almost done here?

411
00:40:28,004 --> 00:40:29,835
My nads are freezing off.

412
00:40:30,006 --> 00:40:31,940
Ellie! I think I found something.

413
00:40:34,010 --> 00:40:36,342
-Should they start further over?
-No.

414
00:40:36,512 --> 00:40:39,276
He stayed by the water
far as he could.

415
00:40:39,482 --> 00:40:44,249
I saw him over the rocks.
He knew he'd lose us down there.

416
00:40:47,290 --> 00:40:48,382
Duggar.

417
00:40:49,592 --> 00:40:51,560
Where'd he find it?

418
00:40:51,828 --> 00:40:53,056
Okay.

419
00:40:53,997 --> 00:40:56,522
Yeah, well, just let me know.

420
00:40:58,167 --> 00:40:59,498
Okay.

421
00:41:00,003 --> 00:41:01,368
I will.

422
00:41:05,575 --> 00:41:07,042
Dormer?

423
00:41:07,810 --> 00:41:11,507
They found Farrell's bullet.
Looks like a .38.

424
00:41:11,948 --> 00:41:14,940
We'll get both bullets to the lab.

425
00:41:15,151 --> 00:41:19,144
See if we can get a fix on the weapon.
If it's okay with you.

426
00:41:22,892 --> 00:41:24,655
A guy came by.
Said he was your new partner.

427
00:41:25,028 --> 00:41:26,723
-Did he leave a name?
-No.

428
00:41:27,864 --> 00:41:30,697
Can I borrow this? Thank you.

429
00:41:30,900 --> 00:41:33,198
-Pioneer Lodge.
-Warfield for Dormer.

430
00:41:33,369 --> 00:41:36,065
John Warfield.
He's called a couple times.

431
00:41:38,674 --> 00:41:40,437
Want me to lie?

432
00:41:40,643 --> 00:41:43,168
No, I'll take it.

433
00:41:44,680 --> 00:41:46,238
Thank you.

434
00:41:48,684 --> 00:41:49,742
Dormer here.

435
00:41:49,919 --> 00:41:55,414
I was shocked to hear about your
partner. I was getting to know him--

436
00:41:55,625 --> 00:41:56,853
What do you want?

437
00:41:57,026 --> 00:42:00,860
You know what I want,
Eckhart was gonna give it to me.

438
00:42:01,064 --> 00:42:03,589
You got something to say, just say it.

439
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:06,997
-He told you about our conversation?
-Say it.

440
00:42:07,170 --> 00:42:12,039
Let's just say I'm interested to see
your report on what happened.

441
00:42:12,508 --> 00:42:15,033
Don't presume to know what happened.

442
00:42:15,211 --> 00:42:18,874
You weren't here.
But then, you never are, are you?

443
00:42:19,215 --> 00:42:23,845
You're always safe behind some desk,
reading your bullshit reports.

444
00:42:24,053 --> 00:42:28,387
And that is why I have
nothing but contempt for you.

445
00:42:28,558 --> 00:42:31,994
You and all the assholes like you...

446
00:42:32,528 --> 00:42:37,397
...risk nothing, spend all day sucking
the marrow out of real cops...

447
00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:41,559
...when you never had
the balls to be one yourself.

448
00:45:04,747 --> 00:45:08,649
-Detective, you came yourself.
-Yeah.

449
00:45:09,819 --> 00:45:11,514
Sign here.

450
00:45:20,429 --> 00:45:22,226
He didn't suffer too much.

451
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,093
-What's the caliber?
-Don't know.

452
00:45:26,269 --> 00:45:30,603
The gunshot victims I see are
from rifles. Wasn't one of those.

453
00:45:32,742 --> 00:45:35,905
-Had any sleep, detective?
-Yeah.

454
00:46:01,537 --> 00:46:04,938
-What the hell is wrong with you?
-Sorry.

455
00:46:09,679 --> 00:46:10,668
No problem.

456
00:46:11,080 --> 00:46:15,039
-Bullet. I want results by tomorrow.
-Aye, aye, cap'n.

457
00:46:15,318 --> 00:46:18,048
We should check Randy's
whereabouts.

458
00:46:18,220 --> 00:46:20,017
Think it was Randy out there?

459
00:46:20,189 --> 00:46:24,148
He still doesn't have an alibi.
You said he beat Kay.

460
00:46:24,727 --> 00:46:27,025
-You check it out, then.
-I will.

461
00:46:54,490 --> 00:46:56,219
Detective Dormer?

462
00:46:58,394 --> 00:46:59,986
My report. I finished.

463
00:47:00,196 --> 00:47:02,892
I need you to look it over
and sign it.

464
00:47:03,733 --> 00:47:09,194
It's self-explanatory. I look forward
to getting back to work with you.

465
00:47:09,372 --> 00:47:13,172
We have more important
things to do than paperwork.

466
00:47:22,284 --> 00:47:25,151
A man died, Ellie. This is important.

467
00:47:25,354 --> 00:47:28,790
Of course. I didn't mean
to imply that that wasn't--

468
00:47:28,958 --> 00:47:32,018
Be sure of your facts
before you file this.

469
00:47:33,062 --> 00:47:35,895
It's your name on the report.

470
00:48:48,838 --> 00:48:51,363
He couldn't have come from there.

471
00:49:03,886 --> 00:49:06,081
Dormer here.

472
00:49:08,090 --> 00:49:11,924
-Hello?
-Can't sleep, Will?

473
00:49:12,094 --> 00:49:14,062
Me neither.

474
00:49:14,330 --> 00:49:15,422
Who's this?

475
00:49:15,631 --> 00:49:20,193
I got a nap this afternoon,
but I guess you had to work.

476
00:49:20,369 --> 00:49:21,836
Who am I speaking to?

477
00:49:22,004 --> 00:49:24,768
Get rid of your clock yet?
Won't help.

478
00:49:24,940 --> 00:49:28,842
When I moved here, I went
five nights. You believe that?

479
00:49:29,044 --> 00:49:32,411
-This crazy light.
-A name or I'm gonna hang up.

480
00:49:32,581 --> 00:49:37,382
No, you're not. You need the company.
Nothing as lonely as not sleeping.

481
00:49:37,586 --> 00:49:42,455
Feels like the whole fucking planet
is deserted. Just you and me.

482
00:49:42,658 --> 00:49:44,421
So...

483
00:49:44,960 --> 00:49:48,828
...tell me who I'm talking to,
and we can chat a while.

484
00:49:49,031 --> 00:49:50,828
-I can't do that.
-Why not?

485
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:54,265
-Not till you understand some things.
-Like what?

486
00:49:54,436 --> 00:49:56,097
I saw.

487
00:49:58,274 --> 00:50:02,608
-Saw what?
-Saw you shoot your partner.

488
00:50:03,245 --> 00:50:07,545
Saw him die in your arms
on that beach.

489
00:50:07,716 --> 00:50:11,482
I thought you'd blame me.
That's why I dropped my gun.

490
00:50:11,654 --> 00:50:14,384
-My uncle's old .38.
-Yeah.

491
00:50:14,590 --> 00:50:18,424
-You get it? What about ballistics?
-Listen to me now.

492
00:50:18,594 --> 00:50:22,086
I don't know what you think you saw.

493
00:50:22,264 --> 00:50:25,791
We should discuss this,
don't you think? Face to face.

494
00:50:26,001 --> 00:50:29,562
This situation isn't yours
to control. I saw you.

495
00:50:29,738 --> 00:50:33,071
I'll control this situation, pal.

496
00:50:33,242 --> 00:50:38,179
Because you don't hide from me
in a town this small. Get it?

497
00:50:38,347 --> 00:50:40,076
No, not for long.

498
00:50:40,249 --> 00:50:44,049
I need your help.
I'm not telling anyone anything.

499
00:50:44,219 --> 00:50:46,710
We're partners on this.

500
00:51:21,342 --> 00:51:24,436
--but to be remembered
as the Kay we knew and loved.

501
00:51:24,646 --> 00:51:28,138
Swimming,
hiking through the Kebaughs...

502
00:51:28,349 --> 00:51:31,113
...meeting at Darrow's after school...

503
00:51:31,286 --> 00:51:36,724
...and always,
always with a smile on her face.

504
00:51:38,126 --> 00:51:39,821
Detective Dormer?

505
00:51:40,962 --> 00:51:45,592
I want to check something. I was
going over my report last night...

506
00:51:45,767 --> 00:51:49,999
...and I have a question about
where that second shot came from.

507
00:51:50,205 --> 00:51:53,299
You said you heard it
from the waterline...

508
00:51:53,508 --> 00:51:56,944
...but from the way
Detective Eckhart's body fell...

509
00:51:57,111 --> 00:52:01,878
...it couldn't have come from
the rocks further up from the water.

510
00:52:02,217 --> 00:52:08,019
Do you think it's possible you heard
the shot before you hit the waterline?

511
00:52:09,023 --> 00:52:12,117
-Detective Dormer?
-Yeah, it's possible.

512
00:52:12,927 --> 00:52:14,451
Yeah.

513
00:52:20,668 --> 00:52:22,568
Why don't I give her a ride?

514
00:52:22,770 --> 00:52:26,638
-Thought I smelled something.
-How you doing? Coping?

515
00:52:26,808 --> 00:52:28,469
-You're that cop.
-Yeah.

516
00:52:29,143 --> 00:52:32,544
-Are you coming or not?
-Not.

517
00:52:34,315 --> 00:52:35,304
Hey.

518
00:52:42,557 --> 00:52:46,960
You want a stick of gum?
I love chewing gum.

519
00:52:47,662 --> 00:52:50,187
It keeps me awake.

520
00:52:51,666 --> 00:52:55,534
-I never met anyone from L.A. before.
-Not missing much.

521
00:52:55,703 --> 00:52:59,332
-So how do you like our shithole town?
-It's not bad.

522
00:53:01,109 --> 00:53:05,409
-Were you good friends with Kay?
-Best friends. Since grade school.

523
00:53:05,580 --> 00:53:08,845
-That's a long time.
-Yeah, we were like sisters.

524
00:53:09,017 --> 00:53:13,044
Like sisters? Must be tough
for you what happened, then.

525
00:53:13,221 --> 00:53:17,214
Everyone keeps telling me
I'm doing great, considering.

526
00:53:17,392 --> 00:53:20,122
But they're all real worried about me.

527
00:53:20,295 --> 00:53:23,787
They don't even care
if I show up for school or not.

528
00:53:23,965 --> 00:53:26,331
Worried I haven't cried yet.

529
00:53:27,068 --> 00:53:30,037
But ain't no law says
you gotta cry, right?

530
00:53:30,204 --> 00:53:31,933
No, there ain't.

531
00:53:37,211 --> 00:53:39,441
What about her other friends?

532
00:53:40,848 --> 00:53:45,251
Do we have to talk about
Kay right now? God.

533
00:53:45,420 --> 00:53:48,651
I don't want to think
about all that. Just drive.

534
00:53:48,823 --> 00:53:50,757
I understand.

535
00:53:53,061 --> 00:53:56,519
-Want me to take you somewhere?
-As long as it's fun.

536
00:53:56,864 --> 00:53:59,492
Young, impressionable girl...

537
00:53:59,667 --> 00:54:04,502
...left alone with older Los Angeles
cop. Who knows where we might go?

538
00:54:04,806 --> 00:54:07,138
Well, I know a place.

539
00:54:09,143 --> 00:54:12,112
Let's just drift a while.

540
00:54:13,047 --> 00:54:14,878
Look at this.

541
00:54:15,183 --> 00:54:16,946
Who does he think he is?

542
00:54:17,118 --> 00:54:19,916
What does he think he's doing?

543
00:54:20,455 --> 00:54:22,514
-Move over.
-Let him move over.

544
00:54:22,690 --> 00:54:24,021
Come on! Move over!

545
00:54:24,859 --> 00:54:27,828
What are you doing?
Move over, you crazy fuck!

546
00:54:34,001 --> 00:54:36,834
Just a little visit to the dump!

547
00:54:37,004 --> 00:54:41,941
-You should feel at home.
-You just about killed us! Get off me!

548
00:54:42,643 --> 00:54:45,635
-What is this?
-You and Kay were like sisters?

549
00:54:45,813 --> 00:54:50,147
-Yes. I told you.
-Why are her pictures of you torn?

550
00:54:50,351 --> 00:54:54,947
Why was her boyfriend's hands
all over your ass at her funeral?

551
00:54:55,123 --> 00:54:58,650
Randy doesn't have an alibi
because he was with you.

552
00:54:59,127 --> 00:55:02,722
You were out fucking
your best friend's boyfriend.

553
00:55:02,897 --> 00:55:07,197
-That what best friends do?
-She never really loved Randy, okay?

554
00:55:07,468 --> 00:55:09,163
-She didn't love him?
-No.

555
00:55:09,337 --> 00:55:12,829
How do you figure that?
She have someone else?

556
00:55:13,007 --> 00:55:16,670
-I don't know.
-Someone bought her dresses, jewelry?

557
00:55:17,011 --> 00:55:18,603
Hey, look around.

558
00:55:18,780 --> 00:55:23,217
I want to show you something.
You'll understand why I brought you.

559
00:55:23,384 --> 00:55:28,321
This is the spot where your
best friend's naked body was dumped.

560
00:55:28,990 --> 00:55:31,720
Wrapped up in garbage bags!

561
00:55:34,996 --> 00:55:36,395
Tanya...

562
00:55:37,064 --> 00:55:42,161
...l know you don't want anyone knowing
you betrayed your best friend.

563
00:55:42,336 --> 00:55:46,796
That's why you won't give Randy
an alibi for Friday night. I know.

564
00:55:46,974 --> 00:55:51,172
Tell me who Kay was seeing.
And we can forget the whole thing.

565
00:55:51,345 --> 00:55:55,475
It'd be our secret. Our little secret,
but I need a name.

566
00:55:55,650 --> 00:55:57,743
She wouldn't tell me, okay?

567
00:55:57,952 --> 00:56:01,251
She wouldn't tell you?
You're her best friend.

568
00:56:01,422 --> 00:56:04,448
-It was her big fucking secret!
-Why a secret?

569
00:56:04,659 --> 00:56:08,618
I don't-- Because she thought
she was special...

570
00:56:09,330 --> 00:56:12,788
...and she kept saying he'd
help her get out of here.

571
00:56:12,967 --> 00:56:14,832
-Who is "he"?
-I don't know.

572
00:56:15,002 --> 00:56:16,731
-She talked about him?
-Yeah.

573
00:56:16,938 --> 00:56:18,599
-She talked to you?
-Yeah.

574
00:56:18,806 --> 00:56:21,240
And what did she call him?

575
00:56:21,442 --> 00:56:24,673
-She called him something, right?
-Yes!

576
00:56:24,846 --> 00:56:27,337
What? What'd she call him?

577
00:56:28,783 --> 00:56:30,341
Brody.

578
00:56:31,085 --> 00:56:35,852
She called him Brody. That's not
his name, so what's the difference?

579
00:56:36,023 --> 00:56:41,017
Jesus! You happy now,
you fucking asshole?

580
00:56:47,101 --> 00:56:50,559
Okay. You did good. Come on.
I'll let you drive.

581
00:57:00,915 --> 00:57:04,146
It's just poetry.
I read it line by line.

582
00:57:04,318 --> 00:57:09,722
It's nothing specific. Verses
on nature, love. That sort of stuff.

583
00:57:10,725 --> 00:57:12,522
Detective Dormer. Line one.

584
00:57:13,127 --> 00:57:15,823
-Dormer here.
-How're you holding up?

585
00:57:16,030 --> 00:57:20,262
Can't be easy to keep working
after three days of no sleep.

586
00:57:20,468 --> 00:57:22,299
And hard to keep focus.

587
00:57:22,470 --> 00:57:24,461
Are you seeing things yet?

588
00:57:24,639 --> 00:57:28,541
You know, those little flashes?
Tricks of light?

589
00:57:28,776 --> 00:57:29,970
See your partner?

590
00:57:31,312 --> 00:57:35,874
-I see Kay sometimes.
-What can I do for you, sir?

591
00:57:36,050 --> 00:57:39,019
Why couldn't you tell
anyone you shot him?

592
00:57:39,520 --> 00:57:43,320
I mean, it was an accident, right?

593
00:57:43,491 --> 00:57:46,892
I hope so. For your sake.
You know what I'm saying?

594
00:57:47,061 --> 00:57:49,086
No need for threats.

595
00:57:49,263 --> 00:57:52,528
I'm trying to make you
understand my situation.

596
00:57:52,700 --> 00:57:57,103
You thought no one would believe
you because of the trouble in L.A.

597
00:57:57,271 --> 00:57:59,569
I know what that's like, Will.

598
00:58:01,776 --> 00:58:03,971
-I got the same problem.
-You do?

599
00:58:05,346 --> 00:58:07,507
I'm not who you think I am.

600
00:58:07,682 --> 00:58:09,115
-You're not?
-No.

601
00:58:11,452 --> 00:58:15,718
-I'm not a murderer any more than you.
-Why don't we get together?

602
00:58:15,890 --> 00:58:19,986
-Talk, have a beer, whatever?
-Throw a little gas on the fire?

603
00:58:20,161 --> 00:58:21,628
Yeah--

604
00:58:33,708 --> 00:58:36,939
I gotta go check some things.
Why don't you...

605
00:58:37,144 --> 00:58:40,204
...put this stuff back
into evidence and tell....

606
00:58:40,681 --> 00:58:42,046
-What's that guy?
-Fred.

607
00:58:42,249 --> 00:58:44,877
Tell him I'll see him in the morning.

608
00:58:45,052 --> 00:58:47,987
Can we return this?
Her mother might like it.

609
00:58:48,155 --> 00:58:49,179
Sure.

610
01:00:12,707 --> 01:00:14,368
That's right.

611
01:04:20,988 --> 01:04:22,012
Here.

612
01:04:47,648 --> 01:04:51,015
This is Walter.
Leave a message, wait for the beep.

613
01:04:51,185 --> 01:04:54,712
Will, you there?
Where else can you go in that state?

614
01:04:54,888 --> 01:04:57,049
You must've been freezing.

615
01:04:57,224 --> 01:05:01,888
If you want, take a shower.
There are clean towels in the bathroom.

616
01:05:08,135 --> 01:05:11,434
This is Walter.
Leave a message, wait for the beep.

617
01:05:11,638 --> 01:05:15,904
Will, pick up.
I'm not dumb enough to come back--

618
01:05:16,076 --> 01:05:18,840
-Walter Finch.
-Will.

619
01:05:19,013 --> 01:05:21,140
Will Dormer, what are you doing?

620
01:05:21,315 --> 01:05:24,978
I try to help and you're running
around like a maniac.

621
01:05:25,152 --> 01:05:28,610
Were you gonna kill me?
How would you explain that?

622
01:05:28,789 --> 01:05:34,091
No one gets too upset when child
murderers are brought in feet first.

623
01:05:34,261 --> 01:05:38,630
There's no evidence I killed Kay.
You know because I told you.

624
01:05:38,832 --> 01:05:42,928
-Come on. What's wrong with you?
-Guess I'm a little cranky.

625
01:05:43,103 --> 01:05:45,765
-Lack of sleep.
-Get some rest, will you?

626
01:05:45,973 --> 01:05:48,965
Got some pills,
and my bed's nice and comfy.

627
01:05:49,476 --> 01:05:54,004
Another night up and you'll lose it.
Hallucinating, babbling.

628
01:05:54,214 --> 01:05:59,379
Tomorrow when you feel better,
we'll meet in public. We'll sort it out.

629
01:05:59,553 --> 01:06:03,683
There's a ferry north of Nightmute.
I'll be on the 1 1:00.

630
01:06:03,891 --> 01:06:08,828
And before you leave, could you
feed the dogs? They're on a diet.

631
01:06:45,532 --> 01:06:47,397
Dormer? Fax from the lab.

632
01:06:47,568 --> 01:06:50,002
Weapon was a .38 Smith & Wesson.

633
01:06:51,205 --> 01:06:55,938
-We found something that might--
-I found this. At the Connells' .

634
01:07:01,315 --> 01:07:02,612
And?

635
01:07:02,783 --> 01:07:06,184
It's the author of the book
we found in Kay's bag.

636
01:07:06,353 --> 01:07:09,083
It's signed by the author.
He's a local.

637
01:07:09,256 --> 01:07:12,419
Kay had all his books.
We should check it out.

638
01:07:13,360 --> 01:07:17,421
-Small stuff, right?
-Yeah. Sure, sure.

639
01:07:18,065 --> 01:07:21,193
Nice work, Ellie.
She's got sharp eyes, huh?

640
01:07:21,568 --> 01:07:24,435
You bet your ass she does.

641
01:07:25,139 --> 01:07:26,800
Good stuff.

642
01:08:09,283 --> 01:08:11,581
What a view.

643
01:08:13,253 --> 01:08:16,654
-I'm not who you think I am.
-No?

644
01:08:17,891 --> 01:08:18,983
Walter Finch:

645
01:08:19,660 --> 01:08:22,993
Lousy writer. Lonely freak.

646
01:08:23,163 --> 01:08:25,654
Murderer. No?

647
01:08:26,800 --> 01:08:30,258
When I was 7, my grandmother
took me to Portland.

648
01:08:30,704 --> 01:08:34,401
We were walking along
and two guys snatched her purse.

649
01:08:34,608 --> 01:08:37,441
A police officer came
to ask questions.

650
01:08:37,611 --> 01:08:40,944
He stood the whole time.
Uniform looked brand-new.

651
01:08:41,515 --> 01:08:46,214
Shoes, badge were polished.
It was like a soldier, only better.

652
01:08:46,386 --> 01:08:49,116
I respect your profession.
I write about it.

653
01:08:49,289 --> 01:08:53,953
I wanted to become a cop after school.
I couldn't pass all the tests.

654
01:08:54,127 --> 01:08:57,995
You should've tried lnternal Affairs.
They'd have taken you.

655
01:08:58,165 --> 01:09:00,133
What do you want from me?

656
01:09:00,300 --> 01:09:04,327
After Kay died, I knew everyone
would think I meant to do it.

657
01:09:04,504 --> 01:09:08,907
So I cleaned the body, removed
all evidence connecting it to me.

658
01:09:09,543 --> 01:09:11,875
Except for your fucking novel.

659
01:09:13,013 --> 01:09:15,846
You don't always see
the wood for the trees.

660
01:09:16,016 --> 01:09:19,474
You, for one, should have
figured that out by now.

661
01:09:28,862 --> 01:09:33,094
When I heard they had brought
somebody from L.A., I panicked.

662
01:09:33,267 --> 01:09:36,930
I knew the locals would
connect me to Kay eventually.

663
01:09:37,104 --> 01:09:41,768
I could handle them. They never
look in the eyes of a killer.

664
01:09:42,509 --> 01:09:45,376
Killing changes you. You know that.

665
01:09:45,545 --> 01:09:47,376
It's not guilt.

666
01:09:47,581 --> 01:09:50,141
I never meant to do it.

667
01:09:50,784 --> 01:09:53,651
It's like awareness.

668
01:09:53,820 --> 01:09:57,620
Life is so important.
How could it be so fucking fragile?

669
01:09:57,791 --> 01:10:00,351
You'd see it right away,
wouldn't you?

670
01:10:00,527 --> 01:10:04,588
You trying to impress me?
Because you got the wrong guy.

671
01:10:04,765 --> 01:10:07,632
Killing that girl
made you feel special.

672
01:10:07,968 --> 01:10:10,459
But you're not.

673
01:10:11,605 --> 01:10:17,134
You're the same pathetic freak
I've been dealing with for 30 years.

674
01:10:17,311 --> 01:10:20,542
Know how many of you
I caught with your pants down?

675
01:10:20,714 --> 01:10:26,914
-I never touched her like that.
-You wanted to. Now you wish you had.

676
01:10:27,754 --> 01:10:30,746
Best you could do is clip her nails.

677
01:10:32,326 --> 01:10:36,092
Now you're so different.
You don't get it, do you?

678
01:10:36,263 --> 01:10:39,061
You're my job.
You're what I'm paid to do.

679
01:10:39,433 --> 01:10:43,802
You're about as mysterious to me
as a toilet is to a plumber.

680
01:10:44,338 --> 01:10:49,105
Reasons for doing what you did?
Who gives a fuck?

681
01:10:49,309 --> 01:10:51,800
Motivations are everything, Will.

682
01:10:52,713 --> 01:10:55,580
What did you see through the fog?

683
01:10:56,450 --> 01:11:00,284
I saw pretty clearly, didn't l?
I saw you take aim...

684
01:11:00,454 --> 01:11:03,548
-Forget it.
-...shoot your partner in the chest.

685
01:11:04,991 --> 01:11:08,324
I heard him say,
"Get away from me!" Why?

686
01:11:08,662 --> 01:11:11,995
Anything to do with
lnternal Affairs investigation?

687
01:11:12,165 --> 01:11:14,895
All that tension in your department?

688
01:11:15,202 --> 01:11:19,195
-You think I'm that easy?
-I'm saying that's how it looks.

689
01:11:19,740 --> 01:11:22,231
Maybe even how it feels.

690
01:11:23,844 --> 01:11:30,249
How did it feel when you found
out it was Hap? Guilt? Relief?

691
01:11:31,184 --> 01:11:36,349
Suddenly, you're free and clear. Did
you think about it before that moment?

692
01:11:36,790 --> 01:11:40,419
What would it be like
if he wasn't there anymore?

693
01:11:42,996 --> 01:11:45,931
Doesn't mean you did it on purpose.

694
01:11:54,174 --> 01:11:58,634
You figure if you got something on me,
then I'll just roll over?

695
01:11:58,812 --> 01:12:02,009
-Protect my reputation?
-No.

696
01:12:02,349 --> 01:12:04,180
Protect your life's work.

697
01:12:04,818 --> 01:12:10,222
The scumbags you put away will be back
on the street before you go on trial.

698
01:12:10,824 --> 01:12:14,783
With Hap gone, you're free and clear.
Why mess with that?

699
01:12:17,697 --> 01:12:20,996
Kay Connell. Remember her?

700
01:12:22,335 --> 01:12:24,326
It's your choice.

701
01:12:25,872 --> 01:12:28,363
Think of all the other Kay Connells.

702
01:12:28,542 --> 01:12:33,070
Do the math. You're a pragmatist.
You have to be because of your job.

703
01:12:33,847 --> 01:12:37,044
This isn't easy,
but I want you to understand...

704
01:12:37,217 --> 01:12:39,845
...we're in the same situation here.

705
01:12:40,353 --> 01:12:44,756
You didn't mean to kill Hap
any more than I meant to kill Kay.

706
01:12:45,225 --> 01:12:50,060
But that's hard for them to believe,
so that's why we need each other.

707
01:12:51,198 --> 01:12:55,259
We gotta find a patsy for the
Connell case and make it stick.

708
01:12:55,969 --> 01:13:00,736
Then you go back to Los Angeles
and I can go back to living my life.

709
01:13:03,477 --> 01:13:07,379
So, what do you need from me?

710
01:13:08,982 --> 01:13:11,382
What do they know about me?

711
01:13:14,120 --> 01:13:18,648
They found a signed copy of one
of your books at Kay's house.

712
01:13:18,825 --> 01:13:23,228
-So you'll be brought in for questioning.
-At the station?

713
01:13:23,396 --> 01:13:25,921
That's what they usually do.

714
01:13:26,099 --> 01:13:29,830
Brought in for questioning.
I can write that easily.

715
01:13:30,003 --> 01:13:35,270
Calm down. It's no big thing.
It's preliminary inquiry, so...

716
01:13:35,442 --> 01:13:37,740
...just tell the truth.

717
01:13:38,812 --> 01:13:42,771
-Tell them about Randy--
-Why are you talking about Randy?

718
01:13:42,949 --> 01:13:48,114
Talk about your relationship with Kay.
You can't hide it, so just say it.

719
01:13:48,288 --> 01:13:52,520
Randy is none of your business.
It's not your affair.

720
01:13:52,692 --> 01:13:55,456
Shouldn't I tell them
she was unhappy--

721
01:13:55,629 --> 01:14:00,066
Tell them she was unhappy,
but let them find Randy themselves.

722
01:14:00,233 --> 01:14:03,100
That way, they'll make it stick.

723
01:14:03,303 --> 01:14:05,100
Understand?

724
01:14:06,139 --> 01:14:08,232
We need a wild card.

725
01:14:09,809 --> 01:14:14,178
-A wild card?
-Yeah. Something that's there.

726
01:14:14,347 --> 01:14:18,306
Something we can use.
It's in every good detective novel.

727
01:14:18,485 --> 01:14:20,680
You still have the .38?

728
01:14:21,955 --> 01:14:23,422
No.

729
01:14:24,491 --> 01:14:27,324
Really? That's a shame.

730
01:14:27,794 --> 01:14:31,924
We could use that.
That'd be very convincing for them.

731
01:14:34,734 --> 01:14:36,133
This is my stop.

732
01:14:45,645 --> 01:14:46,976
Dormer!

733
01:14:52,886 --> 01:14:54,979
Wild card!

734
01:14:59,593 --> 01:15:02,221
-Night, everyone.
-Night, Francis.

735
01:15:03,330 --> 01:15:05,389
Working some overtime?

736
01:15:05,565 --> 01:15:08,728
-Nice.
-Cracking some big cases?

737
01:15:09,202 --> 01:15:11,534
-Night.
-Night, guys.

738
01:15:57,884 --> 01:16:00,876
This is always the worst
time of night for me.

739
01:16:01,054 --> 01:16:04,455
Too late for yesterday,
too early for tomorrow.

740
01:16:04,624 --> 01:16:08,617
Sorry about the tape.
I had to make sure you'd follow through.

741
01:16:08,795 --> 01:16:10,126
I'll follow through.

742
01:16:10,296 --> 01:16:14,164
I've been thinking it over.
I should tell them about Randy.

743
01:16:14,968 --> 01:16:19,428
-I think that's a bad idea.
-But he's the patsy. He deserves it.

744
01:16:19,606 --> 01:16:22,632
You should have heard
the shit Kay told me.

745
01:16:22,809 --> 01:16:25,676
But these are cops.
They're not children.

746
01:16:25,845 --> 01:16:28,837
You don't throw things
like that in their lap.

747
01:16:29,015 --> 01:16:31,074
I'll push them toward Randy.

748
01:16:31,251 --> 01:16:33,219
When the time is right.

749
01:16:33,386 --> 01:16:37,755
We don't have the gun.
How will we convince them he's guilty?

750
01:16:37,924 --> 01:16:40,051
Did you keep the dress?

751
01:16:40,627 --> 01:16:41,616
The dress?

752
01:16:41,795 --> 01:16:45,424
Kay's dress, nail clippings.
What did you do with those?

753
01:16:45,598 --> 01:16:50,160
That's great. The dress. We could
use that. Even better than the gun.

754
01:16:50,336 --> 01:16:53,931
-Where could he have taken her?
-Where'd you take her?

755
01:16:54,240 --> 01:16:57,209
-She died in the cabin, right?
-Yeah.

756
01:16:57,410 --> 01:17:00,072
Where'd you take her
to clean her up?

757
01:17:00,647 --> 01:17:04,139
Don't think about that.
This is tough enough for you.

758
01:17:04,317 --> 01:17:06,182
-It was an accident.
-Yeah.

759
01:17:06,352 --> 01:17:11,380
-I didn't mean to kill her, you know.
-I know, but what happened?

760
01:17:12,592 --> 01:17:16,961
She called and said that
she and Randy had had a fight.

761
01:17:17,931 --> 01:17:22,459
She wanted to come over and talk,
and I said, "Meet me at our place."

762
01:17:22,635 --> 01:17:24,694
That's the cabin at the beach.

763
01:17:24,871 --> 01:17:28,830
She comes over.
She's distraught and a little drunk.

764
01:17:30,376 --> 01:17:34,676
She starts telling me about how Randy
and Tanya were carrying on.

765
01:17:36,216 --> 01:17:39,982
I only wanted to comfort her.
Hold her.

766
01:17:44,124 --> 01:17:47,491
I kissed her,
and got a little excited...

767
01:17:49,062 --> 01:17:51,860
...and she started laughing at me.

768
01:17:52,899 --> 01:17:55,527
She wouldn't stop laughing.

769
01:17:56,069 --> 01:18:00,733
Ever had someone laugh at you
when you're like that? Vulnerable.

770
01:18:00,907 --> 01:18:04,741
Laughing their ass off?
Someone you thought respected you?

771
01:18:05,245 --> 01:18:07,543
You ever have that happen?

772
01:18:08,248 --> 01:18:12,548
I just wanted to stop her laughing.
And then, you know...

773
01:18:13,386 --> 01:18:14,375
...l hit her.

774
01:18:15,421 --> 01:18:19,084
Couple of times, to stop her.
Get a little respect.

775
01:18:19,259 --> 01:18:22,854
Randy did it all the time.
She liked it when he did it.

776
01:18:23,029 --> 01:18:26,192
She never blamed him.
Never wanted to leave him.

777
01:18:26,366 --> 01:18:29,733
I do it, she starts screaming.
She wouldn't stop.

778
01:18:31,204 --> 01:18:34,230
She's screaming.
I put my hand over her mouth.

779
01:18:35,408 --> 01:18:38,741
Then I'm really scared.
I'm scared shitless.

780
01:18:38,912 --> 01:18:43,474
More scared than I've ever been.
I'm more scared than her.

781
01:18:43,650 --> 01:18:45,242
And then...

782
01:18:46,386 --> 01:18:48,786
...everything was clear.

783
01:18:49,923 --> 01:18:51,823
There was no turning back.

784
01:18:54,194 --> 01:18:57,459
And after that, I was calm.

785
01:18:59,365 --> 01:19:00,457
Real calm.

786
01:19:04,070 --> 01:19:06,436
You and I share a secret.

787
01:19:07,207 --> 01:19:10,370
We know how easy
it is to kill somebody.

788
01:19:11,444 --> 01:19:16,711
That ultimate taboo.
It doesn't exist outside our minds.

789
01:19:17,050 --> 01:19:19,018
I didn't murder her.

790
01:19:19,552 --> 01:19:23,648
I killed her,
but it just ended up that way.

791
01:19:24,557 --> 01:19:27,025
So where'd you take the body?

792
01:19:27,560 --> 01:19:29,357
Thanks for listening to me.

793
01:19:29,529 --> 01:19:34,193
Feels good to talk about that stuff.
I'll be able to sleep now.

794
01:19:34,868 --> 01:19:36,961
You wanna talk about Hap?

795
01:19:48,815 --> 01:19:51,340
-Morning.
-Your phone isn't working.

796
01:19:51,517 --> 01:19:54,281
I turned it off.
I needed to sleep. Sorry.

797
01:19:54,454 --> 01:19:58,288
Fred called that author.
He was happy to cooperate.

798
01:19:58,458 --> 01:20:02,189
He'll be in first thing,
so we need to get to the office.

799
01:20:02,362 --> 01:20:06,298
I forgot to tell you they sell these
in stores in Anchorage.

800
01:20:06,466 --> 01:20:09,697
-No way of finding out who bought it.
-Okay.

801
01:20:09,869 --> 01:20:13,361
Bet you're looking forward
to getting back to L.A.

802
01:20:13,539 --> 01:20:16,133
Back to robbery homicide, or...

803
01:20:16,509 --> 01:20:18,409
...maybe not.

804
01:20:18,578 --> 01:20:22,844
-What are you saying to me, Ellie?
-Nothing.

805
01:20:25,785 --> 01:20:29,152
Are you doing okay?
You haven't been sleeping much.

806
01:20:29,322 --> 01:20:31,790
No, I haven't. No.

807
01:20:36,496 --> 01:20:40,489
A good cop can't sleep because
a piece of the puzzle's missing.

808
01:20:40,667 --> 01:20:43,898
A bad cop, because his
conscience won't let him.

809
01:20:44,837 --> 01:20:47,601
-You said that once.
-I did?

810
01:20:51,210 --> 01:20:54,270
Sounds like something
I'd say, don't it?

811
01:20:56,549 --> 01:20:58,744
I'll see you back there.

812
01:21:03,189 --> 01:21:06,522
In what regard were you
and her familiar?

813
01:21:08,561 --> 01:21:12,327
-How did you know her?
-She was an avid reader of my novels.

814
01:21:12,498 --> 01:21:14,489
When did you meet her first?

815
01:21:14,667 --> 01:21:18,000
A year ago. She came
to a signing in Nightmute.

816
01:21:18,171 --> 01:21:22,039
She hung around afterwards.
We chatted about my writing...

817
01:21:22,208 --> 01:21:24,574
...and how she wanted to write...

818
01:21:25,178 --> 01:21:30,844
...then she asked if she could visit me
and talk about books, things like that.

819
01:21:31,017 --> 01:21:33,850
-And she did?
-Yeah, we became very close.

820
01:21:34,020 --> 01:21:37,319
She got comfortable enough
to show me her writing.

821
01:21:37,490 --> 01:21:40,050
-What does she write?
-Poetry, actually.

822
01:21:40,226 --> 01:21:42,626
-Any good?
-No, not really.

823
01:21:43,029 --> 01:21:46,692
-You tell her that?
-Why would l?

824
01:21:48,201 --> 01:21:53,229
Exactly what was the nature of your
relationship to this girl, Finch?

825
01:21:53,406 --> 01:21:58,070
I was someone she could talk to.
Someone outside of her everyday life.

826
01:21:58,478 --> 01:22:01,504
That's why she needed me
and approached me.

827
01:22:01,681 --> 01:22:03,911
Why'd she need you for that?

828
01:22:04,384 --> 01:22:08,844
-Well, her boyfriend, Randy--
-Randy Stetz?

829
01:22:09,722 --> 01:22:14,216
-Abusive little prick. He hit her.
-We know all this already.

830
01:22:14,394 --> 01:22:16,658
-It was getting worse.
-So?

831
01:22:16,829 --> 01:22:18,353
A lot worse. Really.

832
01:22:18,531 --> 01:22:21,898
Why all this eagerness
to talk about Randy?

833
01:22:22,502 --> 01:22:25,960
You're right. I'm sorry.
That's probably all hearsay.

834
01:22:26,139 --> 01:22:29,302
I don't want anything I say
taken the wrong way.

835
01:22:29,475 --> 01:22:33,172
Anything you say to us
at this stage is in confidence.

836
01:22:33,346 --> 01:22:37,976
Secondly, we're not a bunch of hotheads
who'll draw crazy conclusions.

837
01:22:38,151 --> 01:22:40,745
-Okay.
-Please, continue.

838
01:22:41,354 --> 01:22:46,587
One more thing. Probably doesn't
mean much, but I think Kay was scared.

839
01:22:46,793 --> 01:22:50,194
-I have myself to blame for that.
-Why is that?

840
01:22:50,897 --> 01:22:54,799
Randy knew who I was.
He knew that she had a friend...

841
01:22:54,967 --> 01:22:57,902
...someone she confided in.
It made him furious.

842
01:22:58,271 --> 01:23:02,833
She wrote about being scared.
Her letters were getting desperate.

843
01:23:03,009 --> 01:23:06,001
You still have these letters,
by any chance?

844
01:23:06,179 --> 01:23:09,671
I probably do.
Do you think it might help?

845
01:23:10,016 --> 01:23:11,506
They might.

846
01:23:13,686 --> 01:23:16,985
Okay. Anything else?

847
01:23:17,156 --> 01:23:21,525
The thing that worried her
the most was the gun.

848
01:23:21,694 --> 01:23:25,027
He had this old handgun.
He showed it to her.

849
01:23:25,198 --> 01:23:28,929
I don't know where he got it,
probably wasn't even his...

850
01:23:29,102 --> 01:23:33,368
...but he said he'd use it if he
found out who she was seeing.

851
01:23:33,539 --> 01:23:38,442
He kept it hidden in a heating vent.
You know, in the skirting boards?

852
01:23:42,381 --> 01:23:44,508
It might be the .38.

853
01:23:45,184 --> 01:23:46,913
-Get me Judge Biggs.
-What?

854
01:23:47,086 --> 01:23:49,884
I'm getting a search
warrant to Randy's.

855
01:23:50,056 --> 01:23:54,356
-Get Judge Biggs on the phone.
-I should get over there.

856
01:23:54,627 --> 01:23:55,924
-No!
-No?

857
01:23:56,095 --> 01:24:01,863
You're the guy he's talking to.
So we're waiting for the warrant. Okay?

858
01:24:05,104 --> 01:24:08,403
Do you know when Randy
showed her the gun?

859
01:24:08,608 --> 01:24:10,599
February?

860
01:24:11,744 --> 01:24:13,837
No, probably January.

861
01:24:14,013 --> 01:24:16,777
Why didn't you come
forward when she died?

862
01:24:16,949 --> 01:24:22,114
-She didn't want anybody to know.
-Even when she was dead?

863
01:24:22,388 --> 01:24:26,654
Beaten to death. Her body
dumped on a pile of garbage!

864
01:24:26,826 --> 01:24:28,589
-I was her friend.
-No!

865
01:24:28,761 --> 01:24:31,628
-Acquaintance. We were close--
-Close?

866
01:24:31,797 --> 01:24:35,426
She was attractive.
Did you have sex with her?

867
01:24:35,635 --> 01:24:38,502
-She was 1 7.
-Seventeen? She was attractive.

868
01:24:38,671 --> 01:24:39,797
I suppose.

869
01:24:39,972 --> 01:24:43,271
Suppose? She was.
So did you have sex with her?

870
01:24:43,442 --> 01:24:47,435
-No, I was her mentor.
-You bought her things. Gifts.

871
01:24:47,813 --> 01:24:49,804
-Yes.
-What kind of gifts?

872
01:24:49,982 --> 01:24:54,817
-Books, mostly, that's what she loved.
-Books? What about this?

873
01:24:55,087 --> 01:24:58,215
-You give her this?
-Yes.

874
01:24:58,858 --> 01:25:00,348
Why?

875
01:25:00,626 --> 01:25:03,527
-To see how she looked with it on?
-No.

876
01:25:03,696 --> 01:25:06,529
-No? Why jewelry?
-It was just a present.

877
01:25:06,699 --> 01:25:10,635
-Bought a lot of presents? Dresses?
-What's wrong with that?

878
01:25:10,803 --> 01:25:14,637
Nothing. I'm figuring out
what kind of mentor you were.

879
01:25:14,807 --> 01:25:17,207
I gave her things she couldn't have.

880
01:25:17,376 --> 01:25:21,176
You wanted to fuck her, didn't you?
Sick son of a bitch!

881
01:25:23,182 --> 01:25:25,150
-Cool off.
-Sick bastard.

882
01:25:25,718 --> 01:25:28,585
You have to cool down. Okay?
Cool down.

883
01:25:28,754 --> 01:25:32,383
All right. I need a break.

884
01:25:49,308 --> 01:25:52,505
I have to apologize
on behalf of my colleague.

885
01:25:52,979 --> 01:25:57,075
He's been under a lot of pressure
lately. But he's a good cop.

886
01:25:57,683 --> 01:26:00,811
I'd hate to see the bad cop.

887
01:26:05,992 --> 01:26:08,586
Search and seizure warrant.
Yes, sir.

888
01:26:08,761 --> 01:26:09,819
Randy Stetz.

889
01:26:23,509 --> 01:26:26,706
-We got our warrant!
-Thank you. We appreciate it.

890
01:26:39,258 --> 01:26:41,818
Francis, come with me. Let's go!

891
01:26:47,033 --> 01:26:48,967
-You're not going?
-No.

892
01:27:13,259 --> 01:27:15,523
Are you not on the Connell case?

893
01:27:15,761 --> 01:27:19,595
I'm covering the shooting
of Detective Dormer's partner.

894
01:27:19,765 --> 01:27:21,130
Heard about that.

895
01:27:23,969 --> 01:27:28,599
-Should I call about Kay's letters?
-Yeah. I'll pick them up.

896
01:27:52,164 --> 01:27:54,928
Stetz! We're coming in!

897
01:28:11,917 --> 01:28:14,010
Turn the place over.

898
01:28:24,463 --> 01:28:26,397
Look there! Try over there!

899
01:28:26,866 --> 01:28:29,027
Rich, look here now.

900
01:28:35,908 --> 01:28:37,705
I got it! Hey, Fred!

901
01:28:57,997 --> 01:29:01,455
-Just in time, Dormer.
-Had it in the motor oil.

902
01:29:04,470 --> 01:29:05,869
What the fuck is this?

903
01:29:29,261 --> 01:29:32,321
He says he was with Tanya
when Kay was killed.

904
01:29:32,498 --> 01:29:34,796
-That's what she told me.
-When?

905
01:29:34,967 --> 01:29:38,562
-When I questioned her.
-Were you planning on telling us?

906
01:29:38,737 --> 01:29:40,568
That's what I'm doing now.

907
01:29:46,479 --> 01:29:50,813
Randy and Tanya were screwing around.
She's trying to protect him.

908
01:29:50,983 --> 01:29:53,247
-And the gun?
-Says it isn't his.

909
01:29:53,419 --> 01:29:56,980
If we get the ballistics match,
he'll be forthcoming.

910
01:29:57,156 --> 01:29:59,249
-Leaving?
-First thing tomorrow.

911
01:29:59,425 --> 01:30:02,758
If Spencer can remember
where he parked the plane.

912
01:30:29,021 --> 01:30:32,684
I thought you wanted to kill me
in the interview room.

913
01:30:32,858 --> 01:30:36,794
-Randy is in jail.
-Said I'd write an ending they'd like.

914
01:30:36,996 --> 01:30:39,021
You were wrapped up in details.

915
01:30:39,198 --> 01:30:42,167
-The details? He's innocent.
-No, he isn't.

916
01:30:42,334 --> 01:30:45,303
He beat Kay.
One day he'd do something worse.

917
01:30:53,479 --> 01:30:55,310
You knew I planted the gun?

918
01:30:55,481 --> 01:30:58,541
You wanted to help me
before the tape recorder.

919
01:30:58,717 --> 01:31:00,981
You had to have a wild card.

920
01:31:01,153 --> 01:31:05,146
You're a good man. I know that,
even if you've forgotten it.

921
01:31:05,624 --> 01:31:10,994
When were you gonna point them
at me? When you found Kay's dress?

922
01:31:11,564 --> 01:31:15,330
Where I took the body?
lf you have a gun and forensics...

923
01:31:15,501 --> 01:31:19,961
...wouldn't matter what I said
about you killing your partner.

924
01:31:33,152 --> 01:31:35,382
May I have the tape?

925
01:31:43,095 --> 01:31:46,496
-Did you make any other copies?
-Why would l?

926
01:31:46,799 --> 01:31:48,994
Stop me from turning you in.

927
01:31:49,635 --> 01:31:50,829
Or killing you.

928
01:31:51,003 --> 01:31:54,200
I don't have a hold over you.
You made choices.

929
01:31:54,373 --> 01:31:57,831
Like I wasn't here. Why kill me?
It won't help Randy.

930
01:31:58,010 --> 01:32:02,538
After your scene at the department,
it won't do you good if I'm dead.

931
01:32:02,715 --> 01:32:07,345
-A lot of ways a man can die.
-Like an accident? Like Hap.

932
01:32:08,520 --> 01:32:09,885
Like Kay.

933
01:32:11,924 --> 01:32:15,792
It took you 1 0 minutes to beat
Kay Connell to death.

934
01:32:16,095 --> 01:32:20,259
Ten fucking minutes.
You calling that an accident?

935
01:32:20,432 --> 01:32:24,232
It took you a fraction of a second
to kill your partner.

936
01:32:24,403 --> 01:32:26,667
Is that more of an accident?

937
01:32:28,841 --> 01:32:30,866
Is this an accident?

938
01:32:34,713 --> 01:32:37,011
If you want it to be.

939
01:32:51,296 --> 01:32:53,491
It's over, Walt.

940
01:32:54,099 --> 01:32:59,162
It's over. I'm telling them everything.
Tell them about Hap, you, everything.

941
01:32:59,338 --> 01:33:02,364
-What good would that do?
-It'll end this thing.

942
01:33:02,741 --> 01:33:06,142
It won't end it.
You're not thinking straight.

943
01:33:06,311 --> 01:33:10,873
Will you tell the truth? You shot
your partner and lied about it.

944
01:33:11,150 --> 01:33:15,780
To them, you're a liar and a killer.
You're tainted. Forever!

945
01:33:15,954 --> 01:33:21,449
You don't get to pick when you tell
the truth. The truth is beyond that.

946
01:33:22,528 --> 01:33:27,693
That tape was the only proof we had
a conversation outside of that room.

947
01:33:28,867 --> 01:33:31,495
To them, I'm a writer
that Kay admired.

948
01:33:31,670 --> 01:33:36,334
Randy is the killer, and you're a
hero cop. Your life's work is intact.

949
01:33:36,775 --> 01:33:41,474
Another abusive scumbag is in jail.
Everything is as it should be.

950
01:33:41,647 --> 01:33:46,380
Go back to Los Angeles.
The case against Randy is pretty solid.

951
01:33:46,752 --> 01:33:52,247
I can take care of everything here.
I got it worked out. Go home.

952
01:33:57,329 --> 01:34:01,425
Midnight of your sixth night.
You broke my record, Will.

953
01:34:40,205 --> 01:34:44,107
-Randy Stetz. He was an asshole.
-You knew him as a kid?

954
01:34:44,276 --> 01:34:47,768
-Dads were on the same boat.
-Bad seed.

955
01:34:48,147 --> 01:34:50,240
How do you like our beer?

956
01:34:55,954 --> 01:34:58,616
What Dormer needs
is a little shuteye.

957
01:34:58,791 --> 01:35:01,817
-White nights getting to you?
-Hasn't been easy.

958
01:35:01,994 --> 01:35:04,394
-Better than winter.
-Got that right.

959
01:35:04,563 --> 01:35:09,694
-Sun barely comes up for five months.
-Like being sucked into a black hole.

960
01:35:10,469 --> 01:35:15,634
-Hey, Nancy Drew. You hear? We got him.
-Rich found the gun.

961
01:35:17,409 --> 01:35:20,901
-Something's on her mind.
-I found this on the beach.

962
01:35:21,079 --> 01:35:24,276
-What is it?
-Shell casing, 9mm.

963
01:35:25,317 --> 01:35:28,980
The murder weapon was a .38.
None of us carries a 9mm.

964
01:35:29,154 --> 01:35:31,145
Or backup weapon, right?

965
01:35:32,825 --> 01:35:35,055
Get a hobby, would you?

966
01:35:35,394 --> 01:35:38,659
It's a legitimate point,
isn't it, detective?

967
01:35:42,201 --> 01:35:48,606
This case is closed, Ellie. Hold the
fort, boys. I'll go find a men's room.

968
01:35:49,074 --> 01:35:53,033
Relieve myself of your
fine Alaskan beer.

969
01:35:53,312 --> 01:35:55,439
Do you want a beer or something?

970
01:35:56,081 --> 01:35:57,708
No, thanks.

971
01:35:58,150 --> 01:36:02,484
-He's good people, right?
-Don't get carried away.

972
01:36:03,488 --> 01:36:06,252
What has two thumbs
and loves blowjobs?

973
01:36:06,425 --> 01:36:08,757
-I don't know.
-This guy.

974
01:36:18,704 --> 01:36:20,865
It's been something, Dormer.

975
01:36:21,773 --> 01:36:24,799
It's been really great
working with you.

976
01:36:28,914 --> 01:36:32,543
-Run Will to the airport?
-I gotta pick up the letters.

977
01:36:32,718 --> 01:36:33,844
In Umkumiut--

978
01:36:34,019 --> 01:36:38,547
At his lake house. Dormer will
have to leave my car at the dock.

979
01:36:38,724 --> 01:36:42,353
-If that's okay with you?
-Yeah, it's fine.

980
01:36:48,734 --> 01:36:50,725
It's been a pleasure.

981
01:36:50,903 --> 01:36:52,530
Get some sleep.

982
01:38:15,988 --> 01:38:17,580
Detective Dormer.

983
01:38:18,890 --> 01:38:19,879
What is it?

984
01:38:20,058 --> 01:38:24,085
Someone's complaining about the noise.
Says he can't sleep.

985
01:38:24,830 --> 01:38:26,695
Something wrong?

986
01:38:28,633 --> 01:38:31,466
It's so fucking bright in here.

987
01:38:33,939 --> 01:38:36,032
No, it's dark in here.

988
01:38:40,979 --> 01:38:42,571
Will you please...?

989
01:38:57,029 --> 01:39:02,661
There's this guy, Wayne Dobbs, 24.
Works part time at a copy store.

990
01:39:03,301 --> 01:39:06,668
Every day he watches
this 8-year-old boy...

991
01:39:06,838 --> 01:39:10,239
...waiting for his carpool
across the street.

992
01:39:10,409 --> 01:39:14,812
-This is one of your cases?
-Yeah. Hap and me.

993
01:39:14,980 --> 01:39:16,470
A year and a half ago.

994
01:39:16,648 --> 01:39:19,310
For six months, he watches this kid.

995
01:39:19,484 --> 01:39:21,952
Finally gets up the nerve.

996
01:39:22,120 --> 01:39:25,749
He goes down, grabs that boy
before the carpool comes...

997
01:39:25,924 --> 01:39:29,018
...takes him back to his apartment...

998
01:39:29,294 --> 01:39:33,060
...and keeps him there for three days.

999
01:39:34,166 --> 01:39:36,430
He tortures him...

1000
01:39:39,838 --> 01:39:41,863
...and makes him do things.

1001
01:39:42,040 --> 01:39:45,271
And, finally, he's had enough.
He gets a rope.

1002
01:39:45,444 --> 01:39:50,177
He hangs the boy in a storage space
in the basement of the building.

1003
01:39:50,449 --> 01:39:52,713
But he didn't do it right.

1004
01:39:52,984 --> 01:39:58,650
Little boy's neck didn't break,
so he dangled there for a while...

1005
01:39:58,824 --> 01:40:01,793
...and then died finally
from the shock.

1006
01:40:01,993 --> 01:40:05,861
Landlord found the body
five days later.

1007
01:40:06,364 --> 01:40:09,993
The second I met this guy, Dobbs,
I knew he was guilty.

1008
01:40:10,202 --> 01:40:13,729
That's what I do. That's my job.
I assign guilt.

1009
01:40:13,905 --> 01:40:15,839
You find the evidence...

1010
01:40:16,374 --> 01:40:21,277
...figure out who did it, and then
you go get them and put them away.

1011
01:40:22,781 --> 01:40:29,243
This time there wasn't enough evidence.
And it's reasonable doubt to a jury...

1012
01:40:29,421 --> 01:40:33,858
...because a jury never
met a child murderer before.

1013
01:40:34,025 --> 01:40:35,219
But I have.

1014
01:40:37,562 --> 01:40:38,722
Anyway....

1015
01:40:42,434 --> 01:40:47,064
I went and took some blood samples
from the boy's dead body...

1016
01:40:49,574 --> 01:40:51,132
...and I planted them...

1017
01:40:54,479 --> 01:40:56,538
...in Dobbs' apartment.

1018
01:41:02,220 --> 01:41:03,812
I could feel it there.

1019
01:41:04,956 --> 01:41:07,481
This is gonna catch up with me.

1020
01:41:08,126 --> 01:41:12,620
-I don't do things like that.
-So how did it catch up with you?

1021
01:41:12,797 --> 01:41:16,255
Internal Affairs is coming down
on our department.

1022
01:41:16,434 --> 01:41:20,928
Hap, he was gonna cut a deal...

1023
01:41:21,740 --> 01:41:24,504
...and bring me straight into it.

1024
01:41:24,743 --> 01:41:28,338
They would've reopened Dobbs' case,
he would've walked.

1025
01:41:28,513 --> 01:41:31,846
Now that won't happen.
And I don't know...

1026
01:41:32,717 --> 01:41:34,947
...how I feel about that.

1027
01:41:36,688 --> 01:41:40,419
But Dobbs was guilty.
Dobbs needed to be convicted.

1028
01:41:40,592 --> 01:41:44,926
So the end justifies the means.

1029
01:41:46,665 --> 01:41:47,962
Right?

1030
01:41:51,469 --> 01:41:55,064
-I'm in no position to judge.
-Why not?

1031
01:41:55,507 --> 01:41:58,169
Two kinds of people live in Alaska.

1032
01:41:58,343 --> 01:42:03,645
The ones who are born here, and the
ones who come here to escape something.

1033
01:42:04,482 --> 01:42:06,143
I wasn't born here.

1034
01:42:06,952 --> 01:42:09,750
Why don't you tell me what you think?

1035
01:42:10,121 --> 01:42:14,455
Here. Now. In this room. You and me.

1036
01:42:15,360 --> 01:42:16,554
Please.

1037
01:42:20,632 --> 01:42:24,398
I guess it's about what you
thought was right at the time.

1038
01:42:26,371 --> 01:42:29,238
Then, what you're willing to live with.

1039
01:44:09,874 --> 01:44:12,843
-Nightmute Police Department.
-Detective Burr.

1040
01:44:13,011 --> 01:44:17,243
She's not here. She left town
about 20 minutes ago to go pick up--

1041
01:44:42,140 --> 01:44:44,608
-Mr. Finch.
-Detective Burr.

1042
01:44:44,776 --> 01:44:46,676
-Are they friendly?
-Yeah.

1043
01:44:46,845 --> 01:44:52,044
Didn't expect to see you this soon.
Sorry about the mess, doing some work.

1044
01:45:05,196 --> 01:45:08,996
Could Kay's letters strengthen
the case against Randy?

1045
01:45:09,167 --> 01:45:10,361
Possibly.

1046
01:45:42,600 --> 01:45:44,830
Watch your head.
I've done it 1 000 times.

1047
01:45:51,910 --> 01:45:55,903
Sorry about all the clutter.
I am a pack-rat.

1048
01:45:57,248 --> 01:45:59,239
I keep everything.

1049
01:46:00,118 --> 01:46:02,450
I got them. Just don't know where.

1050
01:46:04,389 --> 01:46:08,382
-They've gotta be here somewhere.
-Working on a new book?

1051
01:46:08,560 --> 01:46:11,358
-Have you read any of my books?
-I haven't.

1052
01:46:52,670 --> 01:46:55,138
-She knows, Will.
-Where is she?

1053
01:46:55,306 --> 01:47:00,175
She knows you killed Hap. You would've
realized if you weren't strung out.

1054
01:47:00,345 --> 01:47:03,109
-The way she looks at you--
-Where is she?

1055
01:47:03,281 --> 01:47:06,682
-It's under control.
-If anything happened to her--

1056
01:47:06,851 --> 01:47:07,840
She's okay.

1057
01:47:08,019 --> 01:47:13,252
If she talks, you're fucked. Everything
you've worked for is destroyed.

1058
01:47:15,360 --> 01:47:18,454
-Now give me--
-Show me where she is. Now.

1059
01:47:18,630 --> 01:47:22,862
She's okay.
Listen. I mean, it's all fine.

1060
01:47:26,004 --> 01:47:28,632
Let's search this place.
For the dress.

1061
01:47:28,806 --> 01:47:30,706
-What dress?
-Ellie's....

1062
01:47:31,142 --> 01:47:32,973
-Kay's!
-You're rambling.

1063
01:47:33,144 --> 01:47:34,202
Ellie's here.

1064
01:47:34,379 --> 01:47:36,370
-I'm taking care of us.
-Us?

1065
01:47:36,781 --> 01:47:38,373
-She saw the dress.
-Us?

1066
01:47:38,550 --> 01:47:41,178
Where'd you get us?
Don't talk about us.

1067
01:47:41,352 --> 01:47:43,217
She's alive, Will. Ellie!

1068
01:48:14,052 --> 01:48:15,383
Hold it!

1069
01:48:17,522 --> 01:48:18,648
Don't move!

1070
01:48:19,290 --> 01:48:21,758
You shot Detective Eckhart.

1071
01:48:24,095 --> 01:48:26,359
And Finch saw you do it.

1072
01:48:30,134 --> 01:48:32,500
Did you mean to shoot Hap?

1073
01:48:33,605 --> 01:48:35,937
I don't know anymore.

1074
01:48:38,076 --> 01:48:39,509
I don't know.

1075
01:48:42,180 --> 01:48:47,618
I couldn't see him through the fog,
but when I got up close...

1076
01:48:48,886 --> 01:48:51,184
...he was afraid of me...

1077
01:48:51,689 --> 01:48:56,251
...and he thought I meant to do it,
so maybe I did.

1078
01:48:59,764 --> 01:49:02,255
I just don't know anymore.

1079
01:49:18,449 --> 01:49:20,314
-Where's your gun?
-He took it.

1080
01:49:25,289 --> 01:49:27,086
Keep your head down.

1081
01:49:28,159 --> 01:49:32,391
I got seven rounds in this clip.
Make it last. Head down.

1082
01:49:36,401 --> 01:49:38,801
Okay, go! Go!

1083
01:50:34,892 --> 01:50:36,826
You forgot the wild card.

1084
01:51:51,702 --> 01:51:53,829
Detective Dormer!

1085
01:51:56,774 --> 01:52:02,269
I called for backup. They'll be
here soon. Dormer, just hold on.

1086
01:52:02,914 --> 01:52:04,814
Hold on.

1087
01:52:12,824 --> 01:52:15,554
Nobody needs to know.

1088
01:52:19,463 --> 01:52:23,092
You didn't mean to do it.
I know that even if you don't.

1089
01:52:23,267 --> 01:52:25,531
No, don't. Don't.

1090
01:52:25,703 --> 01:52:27,534
What?

1091
01:52:29,173 --> 01:52:30,367
Why?

1092
01:52:32,443 --> 01:52:35,003
Don't lose your way.

1093
01:52:40,685 --> 01:52:42,619
Hang on.

1094
01:52:44,722 --> 01:52:46,155
Dormer.

1095
01:52:47,458 --> 01:52:49,187
Let me sleep.

1096
01:52:49,360 --> 01:52:51,294
No.

1097
01:52:52,296 --> 01:52:55,231
Just let me sleep.

1098
01:58:04,909 --> 01:58:05,898
