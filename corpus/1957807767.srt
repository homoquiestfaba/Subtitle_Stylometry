00:00:53,626 --> 00:00:56,355
Jesse Damrosch was born in 1987,

1
00:00:56,379 --> 00:00:59,299
two years after the death of
his father's brother, Joseph.

2
00:01:00,133 --> 00:01:03,654
Jesse's grandfather,
Dominic, a retired printer,

3
00:01:03,678 --> 00:01:05,531
had been reluctant to
allow his younger son

4
00:01:05,555 --> 00:01:07,181
to return to the family home.

5
00:01:08,224 --> 00:01:09,451
With his health diminished,

6
00:01:09,475 --> 00:01:11,245
Joseph was admitted to a hospital,

7
00:01:11,269 --> 00:01:14,689
where he would remain until
his death, at 38 years old.

8
00:01:15,732 --> 00:01:17,710
It would seem that Jesse's late uncle

9
00:01:17,734 --> 00:01:19,753
was subject to two deaths:

10
00:01:19,777 --> 00:01:24,049
The official death, as confirmed
by medical tests, was AIDS.

11
00:01:24,073 --> 00:01:27,511
The unofficial death, as
Joseph's father would have it,

12
00:01:27,535 --> 00:01:29,513
was a sudden bout of liver disease,

13
00:01:29,537 --> 00:01:32,540
which he is said to have
contracted from unclean silverware.

14
00:01:33,916 --> 00:01:37,896
Some years later, Jesse's
own father, Richard,

15
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:40,858
would urge caution on his son
when dining at restaurants,

16
00:01:40,882 --> 00:01:42,568
stressing to him the importance

17
00:01:42,592 --> 00:01:44,927
of wiping down his forks and knives.

18
00:01:54,687 --> 00:01:56,665
Liberty is an idea,

19
00:01:56,689 --> 00:02:01,253
handed down from generation to
generation, people to people.

20
00:02:01,277 --> 00:02:04,340
America honors the Statue
of Liberty's centennial

21
00:02:04,364 --> 00:02:07,092
by minting United States Liberty Coins.

22
00:02:07,116 --> 00:02:10,220
Valuable keepsakes that
treasure liberty always.

23
00:02:10,244 --> 00:02:11,680
U.S. Liberty Coins.

24
00:02:11,704 --> 00:02:14,224
Singly or in sets, at
banks, savings and loans,

25
00:02:14,248 --> 00:02:15,976
and Montgomery Ward stores.

26
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,169
Keep liberty in mint condition, forever.

27
00:02:26,761 --> 00:02:28,614
In the spring of 1986,

28
00:02:28,638 --> 00:02:31,450
while vacationing in
Puerto Rico, his first trip

29
00:02:31,474 --> 00:02:33,827
since his brother's death
the previous summer,

30
00:02:33,851 --> 00:02:38,147
Richard was introduced
to Lydia Orkin, age 27.

31
00:02:39,982 --> 00:02:41,818
They met in a hotel elevator.

32
00:02:42,693 --> 00:02:44,570
A year later, they would be married.

33
00:02:46,531 --> 00:02:48,616
It would be Richard's second marriage.

34
00:03:23,151 --> 00:03:24,485
Why don't you thank Mom?

35
00:03:28,281 --> 00:03:29,532
Mind your own business.

36
00:03:33,911 --> 00:03:36,515
While a temporary
tenant in his parents' house,

37
00:03:36,539 --> 00:03:39,143
Richard opened a printing
business of his own.

38
00:03:39,167 --> 00:03:42,396
He acquired many of his
father's former clients.

39
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:44,773
He soon found an apartment for sale

40
00:03:44,797 --> 00:03:46,942
in the nearby town of Haylett,

41
00:03:46,966 --> 00:03:49,570
long eclipsed by its
more affluent neighbor,

42
00:03:49,594 --> 00:03:53,824
Haylett Bay Park, a village
settled by bankers in the 1920s,

43
00:03:53,848 --> 00:03:55,784
and whose families now
earned their fortunes

44
00:03:55,808 --> 00:03:57,935
in the insurance and financial trades.

45
00:04:06,777 --> 00:04:10,048
Unable to afford a down payment
on the Haylett apartment,

46
00:04:10,072 --> 00:04:13,093
Richard turned to an old
acquaintance, John Menlo,

47
00:04:13,117 --> 00:04:15,637
whom he had known since the early 1960s,

48
00:04:15,661 --> 00:04:18,932
when both men were stationed
as military draftees.

49
00:04:18,956 --> 00:04:22,019
The sources of Menlo's
income were ambiguous,

50
00:04:22,043 --> 00:04:23,604
but there was no question that he earned

51
00:04:23,628 --> 00:04:25,254
and spent his money with ease.

52
00:04:26,756 --> 00:04:29,008
He loaned Richard $50,000.

53
00:04:30,051 --> 00:04:31,385
They agreed to the terms.

54
00:05:00,206 --> 00:05:03,918
On April 23rd, Lydia Orkin
officially became Lydia Damrosch.

55
00:05:05,586 --> 00:05:08,607
In a show of gratitude,
Richard chose John Menlo

56
00:05:08,631 --> 00:05:10,567
as his best man.

57
00:05:10,591 --> 00:05:13,779
Lydia's sisters, Christine and Kara Orkin,

58
00:05:13,803 --> 00:05:15,304
were named the bridesmaids.

59
00:05:17,390 --> 00:05:19,493
On behalf of all of us here,

60
00:05:19,517 --> 00:05:22,204
and all the beloved friends
and relatives who could be here

61
00:05:22,228 --> 00:05:25,958
to share this happy day with
you, we all want to ask God

62
00:05:25,982 --> 00:05:30,987
to lead you to a happy and
healthy long life together.

63
00:05:33,072 --> 00:05:34,615
Congratulations to both of you.

64
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:39,847
The total cost
of Richard and Lydia's wedding

65
00:05:39,871 --> 00:05:42,140
exceeded early estimates.

66
00:05:42,164 --> 00:05:44,851
Richard claimed he was
misled about the expense,

67
00:05:44,875 --> 00:05:48,045
and suggested that Lydia's
family pay the remainder.

68
00:05:49,213 --> 00:05:50,899
Fearful of a confrontation,

69
00:05:50,923 --> 00:05:53,009
Lydia convinced her parents to comply.

70
00:05:54,427 --> 00:05:55,511
They settled the bill.

71
00:06:03,769 --> 00:06:05,104
Somebody's at our door.

72
00:06:07,607 --> 00:06:10,043
In the fall,
Richard and Lydia's son,

73
00:06:10,067 --> 00:06:12,486
Jesse Joseph Damrosch, was born.

74
00:06:14,572 --> 00:06:16,258
He was christened in a small ceremony

75
00:06:16,282 --> 00:06:18,284
at a Roman Catholic church in Haylett.

76
00:06:19,744 --> 00:06:22,097
John Menlo and Kara Orkin were selected

77
00:06:22,121 --> 00:06:23,331
as the boy's godparents.

78
00:07:10,878 --> 00:07:13,065
Jesse's birth
coincided with great changes

79
00:07:13,089 --> 00:07:15,817
in the lives of Lydia
and Richard Damrosch.

80
00:07:15,841 --> 00:07:18,403
At around this time, Lydia accepted

81
00:07:18,427 --> 00:07:20,822
a full-time nursing position
in the maternity ward

82
00:07:20,846 --> 00:07:24,034
of a nearby hospital, and
Richard's printing business

83
00:07:24,058 --> 00:07:26,828
soon became profitable,
having gained a stable

84
00:07:26,852 --> 00:07:28,979
of recurring contracts and clients.

85
00:07:29,981 --> 00:07:33,460
And there was talk of more
children, too, as Lydia,

86
00:07:33,484 --> 00:07:35,879
having been born into a large family,

87
00:07:35,903 --> 00:07:39,132
had hoped to leave her
son in supportive hands.

88
00:07:39,156 --> 00:07:42,344
For once an only child suffers
the loss of his parents,

89
00:07:42,368 --> 00:07:45,347
there are few familiar faces to turn to,

90
00:07:45,371 --> 00:07:47,373
and few shared memories to be had.

91
00:08:25,536 --> 00:08:28,181
Flora Orkin had not spoken
to her sister Billie

92
00:08:28,205 --> 00:08:29,373
in six years.

93
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:33,687
The two women had for a time
agreed to share responsibility

94
00:08:33,711 --> 00:08:37,149
for their mother, Josephine,
a depressed woman,

95
00:08:37,173 --> 00:08:38,841
long without a permanent home.

96
00:08:40,050 --> 00:08:44,573
By the spring, however, Billie
and her husband, Ted Alloway,

97
00:08:44,597 --> 00:08:47,909
had announced that they would
no longer house Josephine,

98
00:08:47,933 --> 00:08:49,745
and the Orkins were left with sole custody

99
00:08:49,769 --> 00:08:53,647
of the elderly woman,
much to their distress.

100
00:08:54,690 --> 00:08:56,484
You didn't need to be so friendly.

101
00:08:57,943 --> 00:09:00,922
Why not? I haven't
seen them in a long time.

102
00:09:00,946 --> 00:09:01,758
That's alright.

103
00:09:01,782 --> 00:09:03,604
You and Richard can
invite them to your house.

104
00:09:03,629 --> 00:09:05,233
Why couldn't we invite Aunt Billie in?

105
00:09:05,258 --> 00:09:07,554
- Don't call her Aunt Billie.
- She's not Aunt Billie.

106
00:09:07,578 --> 00:09:09,347
Because that's what I said.

107
00:09:09,371 --> 00:09:10,928
Flora, I'm going to tell your mother

108
00:09:10,953 --> 00:09:12,684
not to invite them into the house again.

109
00:09:12,708 --> 00:09:14,603
Let them wait in the car.

110
00:09:14,627 --> 00:09:18,106
I'll see you later,
okay? Bye, bye, Jesse.

111
00:09:18,130 --> 00:09:19,107
Bye!

112
00:09:19,131 --> 00:09:22,402
Wave bye-bye, Jesse.
Say bye, Aunt Kara.

113
00:09:22,426 --> 00:09:23,426
Bye.

114
00:09:25,888 --> 00:09:27,056
Jesse, look!

115
00:11:12,453 --> 00:11:13,469
Hello!

116
00:11:13,494 --> 00:11:14,473
Hi, ma.

117
00:11:14,497 --> 00:11:16,558
Hello, Jesse, hello!

118
00:11:16,582 --> 00:11:17,934
He's been up since six o'clock.

119
00:11:17,958 --> 00:11:21,021
Oh, no. Well, we'll go
right inside and have a nap.

120
00:11:21,045 --> 00:11:22,338
You be good for Grandma.

121
00:11:23,756 --> 00:11:25,082
Would you like anything to eat?

122
00:11:25,107 --> 00:11:26,194
No, thank you, ma.

123
00:11:26,218 --> 00:11:27,760
Alright, Jesse. Behave yourself.

124
00:11:29,762 --> 00:11:31,448
Me or Lydia will pick him up at five.

125
00:11:31,472 --> 00:11:32,472
That's just fine.

126
00:11:33,349 --> 00:11:34,427
Where's dad?

127
00:11:34,452 --> 00:11:36,536
He went to the store. He'll
be back in a little while.

128
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:37,548
Bye-bye!

129
00:11:37,573 --> 00:11:40,624
Bye-bye!
Oh, you brought Mr. Bunny!

130
00:11:40,648 --> 00:11:44,669
Let's go inside and give Mr.
Bunny something. All right?

131
00:11:44,693 --> 00:11:46,320
Okay. Here we go.

132
00:12:04,672 --> 00:12:07,734
Daze. Faze.

133
00:12:07,758 --> 00:12:10,820
Gaze. Haze.

134
00:12:10,844 --> 00:12:13,823
Maze. Raze.

135
00:12:13,847 --> 00:12:17,160
Now read these words with me:

136
00:12:17,184 --> 00:12:21,730
Blade, blame, blaze, blazer.

137
00:12:23,649 --> 00:12:25,776
Now try this sound: glll.

138
00:12:26,944 --> 00:12:32,050
Listen: Blll, blaze. Glll, glaze.

139
00:12:32,074 --> 00:12:36,262
Join glll with ad. What word do we have?

140
00:12:36,286 --> 00:12:39,432
Look: Glll-ad. Glad.

141
00:12:39,456 --> 00:12:42,042
That's correct. The word is glad.

142
00:13:29,465 --> 00:13:30,465
Which one?

143
00:14:17,721 --> 00:14:19,264
You're very blessed, Richard.

144
00:14:20,599 --> 00:14:21,599
Thanks, Ma.

145
00:14:23,477 --> 00:14:28,482
You have a wonderful
son. A wonderful wife.

146
00:14:32,236 --> 00:14:35,489
I think he's going to have a good life.

147
00:14:51,797 --> 00:14:53,026
It should start now.

148
00:14:53,051 --> 00:14:54,168
Is it on?

149
00:14:54,193 --> 00:14:55,333
Is there a red light?

150
00:14:55,358 --> 00:14:56,403
Yes.

151
00:14:56,427 --> 00:14:58,029
If it's flashing, then it's on.

152
00:14:58,053 --> 00:14:59,280
It's flashing.

153
00:14:59,304 --> 00:15:00,116
You see it?

154
00:15:00,140 --> 00:15:00,771
Yes!

155
00:15:00,796 --> 00:15:02,171
What's it doing?

156
00:15:02,196 --> 00:15:03,344
It's a flashing red light.

157
00:15:04,674 --> 00:15:07,034
There's the man of the hour. Alfons!

158
00:15:11,525 --> 00:15:13,110
Happy birthday on Long Island.

159
00:15:14,570 --> 00:15:15,988
How do you like my house, Al?

160
00:15:17,573 --> 00:15:20,617
Very nice house. Very nice family.

161
00:15:21,994 --> 00:15:23,120
Very nice ride.

162
00:15:26,039 --> 00:15:27,499
How do I shut this now?

163
00:15:28,959 --> 00:15:33,964
One, two, three. Happy birthday!

164
00:15:37,092 --> 00:15:40,387
Let's give him a hand.

165
00:16:09,583 --> 00:16:11,769
Richard can put that together.

166
00:16:11,793 --> 00:16:14,880
No, not me. Lydia, take it
over to your father's house.

167
00:16:17,925 --> 00:16:20,278
Wow. Did you say thank you?

168
00:16:20,302 --> 00:16:21,303
Thank you!

169
00:16:22,471 --> 00:16:24,932
Where is Daddy? He's
been gone for a few hours.

170
00:16:31,230 --> 00:16:32,999
You must be tired, Richard.

171
00:16:33,023 --> 00:16:34,584
No, I'm up all night tonight, ma.

172
00:16:34,608 --> 00:16:36,586
Tomorrow I have to be in
the city at eight o'clock.

173
00:16:36,610 --> 00:16:37,610
Oh, my.

174
00:16:39,613 --> 00:16:41,090
How do you like my new picture?

175
00:16:41,114 --> 00:16:43,551
I saw it. It's lovely.

176
00:16:43,575 --> 00:16:44,719
You picked it out?

177
00:16:44,743 --> 00:16:46,262
I bought it.

178
00:16:46,286 --> 00:16:49,557
Is that Eve hiding behind it?

179
00:16:49,581 --> 00:16:50,958
No, ma. That's a parakeet.

180
00:16:52,751 --> 00:16:53,646
Oh!

181
00:16:53,670 --> 00:16:55,772
That's what it is. It's a big parrot.

182
00:16:55,796 --> 00:16:59,943
I thought it was Eve in
the garden, hiding behind.

183
00:16:59,967 --> 00:17:00,967
No, ma.

184
00:17:02,719 --> 00:17:06,032
- Dad, you got new shoes?
- Those are nice and shiny!

185
00:17:06,056 --> 00:17:07,533
Thank you.

186
00:17:07,557 --> 00:17:09,518
How do you like that? Very nice, dad.

187
00:17:12,104 --> 00:17:13,373
Mary, we know you have

188
00:17:13,397 --> 00:17:16,334
a four-and-a-half-karat ring, all right?

189
00:17:16,358 --> 00:17:17,710
I wish.

190
00:17:17,734 --> 00:17:19,379
Every time I see you,
you have your hands

191
00:17:19,403 --> 00:17:21,631
jangling around with
all the jewelry on them.

192
00:17:21,655 --> 00:17:22,674
What jewelry?

193
00:17:22,698 --> 00:17:24,366
What do you have on your hands?

194
00:17:24,391 --> 00:17:25,677
What jewelry?

195
00:17:25,701 --> 00:17:27,637
How much money do you
have on your wrists?

196
00:17:27,661 --> 00:17:29,871
Lydia, can you shoot your husband?

197
00:17:38,338 --> 00:17:41,985
Did you bring the
candles? Wait, wait, wait!

198
00:17:42,009 --> 00:17:44,636
We've got to light the
candles first, Rich. Come on!

199
00:17:46,013 --> 00:17:48,015
- All right.
- Here we go.

00:17:56,273 --> 00:18:00,670

201
00:18:00,694 --> 00:18:05,049

Make a wish!

205
00:18:19,796 --> 00:18:22,358
Who wants cake? Who wants cake?

206
00:18:22,382 --> 00:18:24,319
This would be the last time

207
00:18:24,343 --> 00:18:27,196
the Orkins celebrated their
grandson's birthday in Haylett,

208
00:18:27,220 --> 00:18:28,263
in Richard's company.

209
00:18:29,639 --> 00:18:32,744
- You want that?
- You want it?

210
00:18:32,768 --> 00:18:35,038
It's got a little frosting
on it. You want it?

211
00:18:35,062 --> 00:18:38,231
Go ahead, take it! It's all yours.

212
00:19:18,939 --> 00:19:21,459
Children, children! Come with me.

213
00:19:21,483 --> 00:19:24,569
Single-file, down the hall.

214
00:19:58,728 --> 00:20:01,815
Pay attention!

215
00:20:06,778 --> 00:20:08,905
Pamela, your nose is bleeding.

216
00:20:41,855 --> 00:20:44,292
The liberation
of Kuwait is underway,

217
00:20:44,316 --> 00:20:46,752
and he said it was under,
and the military gives names

218
00:20:46,776 --> 00:20:50,214
to these things, under
the name of Desert Storm.

219
00:20:50,238 --> 00:20:52,133
Billie and Ted
Alloway had been traveling

220
00:20:52,157 --> 00:20:53,885
through the Caribbean when they chanced

221
00:20:53,910 --> 00:20:56,971
upon the Damrosches in
the lobby of their hotel.

222
00:20:56,995 --> 00:21:00,808
Unbeknownst to Lydia, the
Alloways had arrived a week prior,

223
00:21:00,832 --> 00:21:02,894
as it was their habit to
spend part of the winter

224
00:21:02,918 --> 00:21:04,979
in the Bahamas each year.

225
00:21:05,003 --> 00:21:07,940
Before they returned
home, Lydia asked Jesse

226
00:21:07,964 --> 00:21:10,443
not to tell the Orkins that
they had seen Aunt Billie

227
00:21:10,467 --> 00:21:12,219
and Uncle Ted on their vacation.

228
00:21:13,678 --> 00:21:15,948
The Orkins didn't get
along with the Alloways,

229
00:21:15,972 --> 00:21:18,326
Lydia said, and they would be upset

230
00:21:18,350 --> 00:21:20,602
to learn that they had
joined them for dinner.

231
00:21:35,534 --> 00:21:38,286
Ma, you don't have to clean up.

232
00:21:42,332 --> 00:21:44,060
What did you give me for my birthday?

233
00:21:44,084 --> 00:21:48,839
It's my birthday! Thank you, Daddy.

234
00:22:08,233 --> 00:22:10,443
Did Lydia tell you
we've been getting calls?

235
00:22:12,821 --> 00:22:14,382
Calls from who?

236
00:22:14,406 --> 00:22:15,824
From a collection agency.

237
00:22:16,908 --> 00:22:18,743
Do know why they would be calling us?

238
00:22:21,079 --> 00:22:22,581
I don't know anything about that.

239
00:22:23,873 --> 00:22:25,268
Lydia's always out spending money.

240
00:22:25,292 --> 00:22:27,895
I know she is. She's
putting out a lot for Jesse.

241
00:22:27,919 --> 00:22:28,962
All of his things.

242
00:22:30,589 --> 00:22:31,607
I can't do anything about that.

243
00:22:31,631 --> 00:22:32,900
She can't afford it anymore, Rich.

244
00:22:32,924 --> 00:22:34,694
Can't you help my daughter out?

245
00:22:34,718 --> 00:22:36,821
Not me. You and Flora.

246
00:22:36,845 --> 00:22:37,655
I've done enough.

247
00:22:37,679 --> 00:22:38,490
Do you see all the things

248
00:22:38,514 --> 00:22:39,699
we have to go through around here?

249
00:22:39,723 --> 00:22:40,534
Nick.

250
00:22:40,558 --> 00:22:42,368
It's getting difficult for
us. We can't do it anymore.

251
00:22:42,392 --> 00:22:43,744
Wait a minute.

252
00:22:43,768 --> 00:22:45,788
I can't even afford a new pair of socks,

253
00:22:46,291 --> 00:22:48,249
and you have wall-to-wall carpeting.

254
00:22:48,274 --> 00:22:49,596
What do you think? My life is so easy?

255
00:22:49,620 --> 00:22:51,128
You seem to be doing pretty okay.

256
00:22:51,153 --> 00:22:52,378
You think my life is a piece of cake?

257
00:22:52,402 --> 00:22:53,421
I don't think anything.

258
00:22:53,445 --> 00:22:55,131
It's because people respect me.

259
00:22:55,155 --> 00:22:55,966
Good.

260
00:22:55,990 --> 00:22:57,300
My friends respect me.

261
00:22:57,324 --> 00:22:59,468
The only reason I have the lifestyle I do

262
00:22:59,492 --> 00:23:00,886
is because I have loyal friends.

263
00:23:00,910 --> 00:23:01,910
I'm glad.

264
00:23:03,121 --> 00:23:06,517
Without my friends, your
daughter and your grandson

265
00:23:06,541 --> 00:23:07,709
would be on the street.

266
00:23:10,420 --> 00:23:13,089
If it wasn't for my daughter,
you'd be on the street.

267
00:23:14,341 --> 00:23:15,341
You think so?

268
00:23:16,343 --> 00:23:17,757
Why don't you do something useful

269
00:23:17,782 --> 00:23:19,033
and take out the garbage?

270
00:23:25,310 --> 00:23:26,645
You're a real fuck, Nick.

271
00:23:27,896 --> 00:23:29,773
I think it's time you hit the road.

272
00:23:33,068 --> 00:23:36,130
Lydia! Your father just insulted me!

273
00:23:36,154 --> 00:23:37,214
I'm not going to stick around

274
00:23:37,238 --> 00:23:38,674
while your parents treat me like garbage!

275
00:23:38,698 --> 00:23:40,176
I'm fucking tired of it!

276
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:42,077
I'm not gonna put up with it anymore!

277
00:23:51,378 --> 00:23:52,813
The baby in this picture

278
00:23:52,837 --> 00:23:54,964
is going to have a very special year.

279
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:57,902
A year of first steps.

280
00:23:57,926 --> 00:23:59,803
First words. First birthday.

281
00:24:01,221 --> 00:24:05,159
And none of these firsts
will ever happen again.

282
00:24:05,183 --> 00:24:07,536
Now, if you were this baby's parents,

283
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:09,020
which film would you choose?

284
00:24:10,313 --> 00:24:12,708
No other film in the
world gives you purer,

285
00:24:12,732 --> 00:24:15,819
richer colors than Kodacolor Gold film.

286
00:24:17,028 --> 00:24:18,613
Aren't your pictures worth gold?

287
00:24:21,574 --> 00:24:22,574
Look up.

288
00:25:07,036 --> 00:25:09,140
As a compromise with the Orkins,

289
00:25:09,164 --> 00:25:13,477
Josephine's son, Robert,
a music instructor,

290
00:25:13,501 --> 00:25:14,729
agreed to house his mother

291
00:25:14,753 --> 00:25:17,130
from October to December of each year.

292
00:25:18,214 --> 00:25:21,485
There, Josephine would
live a solitary life,

293
00:25:21,509 --> 00:25:23,446
spending her days alone,

294
00:25:23,470 --> 00:25:26,198
restricted to a diet of condensed soup,

295
00:25:26,222 --> 00:25:29,517
and separate from her aloof
son and his unsympathetic wife.

296
00:25:47,494 --> 00:25:49,079
You got any pickles, Jean?

297
00:25:52,874 --> 00:25:53,874
I didn't shop.

298
00:26:01,091 --> 00:26:02,091
Robert?

299
00:26:05,261 --> 00:26:06,261
Robert?

300
00:26:08,348 --> 00:26:09,348
Hmm?

301
00:26:14,521 --> 00:26:18,858
Would you pick up some
things at the store for me?

302
00:26:24,447 --> 00:26:26,825
Would you pick up some
things for me, Robert?

303
00:26:29,536 --> 00:26:31,412
What kind of things?

304
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:37,043
When you go out. Some
things for the kitchen.

305
00:26:42,549 --> 00:26:44,175
That depends on what's on sale.

306
00:26:50,014 --> 00:26:52,076
I can give you the money.

307
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:55,311
You know, Jo, Bob has been
making a lot of sacrifices.

308
00:26:57,772 --> 00:27:01,252
I'm sorry. I don't
want to put anybody out.

309
00:27:01,276 --> 00:27:04,612
It's just that there's not much food.

310
00:29:14,742 --> 00:29:16,470
After less than a year,

311
00:29:16,494 --> 00:29:18,806
Josephine returned to the Orkins' home,

312
00:29:18,830 --> 00:29:20,891
where she would remain indefinitely,

313
00:29:20,915 --> 00:29:23,543
safely away from her son and his wife.

314
00:29:24,627 --> 00:29:26,480
And despite Robert's vile indifference

315
00:29:26,504 --> 00:29:29,358
and cruelties as a son,
no one could ever say

316
00:29:29,382 --> 00:29:31,485
that Josephine accepted
her youngest child's

317
00:29:31,509 --> 00:29:33,803
sudden disappearance
from her life with ease.

318
00:29:34,929 --> 00:29:36,657
But the Orkins had already decided

319
00:29:36,681 --> 00:29:39,535
that there would be no
attempts to settle differences,

320
00:29:39,559 --> 00:29:43,563
just as there would be no
cards, no letters, and no calls.

321
00:29:50,862 --> 00:29:54,032
Hello? Who's this?

322
00:29:54,949 --> 00:29:55,949
Who is it?

323
00:29:57,076 --> 00:29:58,076
It's your sister.

324
00:29:58,911 --> 00:30:00,246
Give it to me.

325
00:30:04,459 --> 00:30:08,379
Hello? For what?

326
00:30:11,007 --> 00:30:14,093
Billie, that is not our problem.

327
00:30:15,678 --> 00:30:17,239
No one here ever told her

328
00:30:17,263 --> 00:30:19,307
to do anything she didn't want to do.

329
00:30:22,143 --> 00:30:23,143
I don't know.

330
00:30:25,063 --> 00:30:26,564
Well, then that's what you do.

331
00:30:29,484 --> 00:30:32,838
No, and she already said so.

332
00:30:32,862 --> 00:30:34,631
What does she want?

333
00:30:34,655 --> 00:30:37,241
We have to do what's best for us.

334
00:30:39,410 --> 00:30:42,038
No. I'm going to hang up.

335
00:30:43,122 --> 00:30:47,293
Here. Billie, listen to me.

336
00:30:48,378 --> 00:30:50,898
This has got to stop.
You want to call here?

337
00:30:50,922 --> 00:30:55,861
Then come take your mother. No way.

338
00:30:55,885 --> 00:30:56,904
You and Ted get in the car and drive here,

339
00:30:56,928 --> 00:30:58,638
otherwise we go our separate ways.

340
00:30:59,555 --> 00:31:00,932
You've done nothing for us.

341
00:31:02,892 --> 00:31:03,935
That's what we'll do.

342
00:31:06,562 --> 00:31:07,562
You said it.

343
00:31:28,292 --> 00:31:29,603
Who was on the phone?

344
00:31:29,627 --> 00:31:30,627
Billie.

345
00:31:31,671 --> 00:31:33,172
She didn't want to talk to Grandma?

346
00:31:34,090 --> 00:31:35,090
No.

347
00:31:43,558 --> 00:31:45,369
Are you fucking kidding me?

348
00:31:45,393 --> 00:31:47,520
You know what, Richard,
you're a cheap, flying fuck!

349
00:33:36,087 --> 00:33:37,567
Can you take this to Great-Grandma?

350
00:33:47,598 --> 00:33:48,598
Thank you.

351
00:33:50,142 --> 00:33:51,894
Would you get my purse over there?

352
00:34:07,618 --> 00:34:09,096
Here.

353
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:10,472
What's this?

354
00:34:10,496 --> 00:34:12,057
It's for you.

355
00:34:12,081 --> 00:34:13,976
I wanted to get you
something at Christmas,

356
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,459
but I didn't get to see you.

357
00:34:16,794 --> 00:34:18,939
You don't have to do that.

358
00:34:18,963 --> 00:34:20,840
I'm sorry, it's not much.

359
00:34:23,509 --> 00:34:27,990
Thank you.

360
00:34:28,014 --> 00:34:29,890
You're welcome. You're a sweet boy.

361
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:34,562
Would you say hello to your
grandmother Claire for me?

362
00:34:35,479 --> 00:34:36,915
Yes.

363
00:34:36,939 --> 00:34:38,959
Give her my best, will you?

364
00:34:38,983 --> 00:34:39,983
I will.

365
00:34:42,069 --> 00:34:44,506
Okay. I'm going to rest now.

366
00:34:44,530 --> 00:34:46,049
Okay.

367
00:34:46,073 --> 00:34:47,950
Will you close the door when you leave?

368
00:35:05,801 --> 00:35:07,321
You have to leave it in a little longer.

369
00:35:07,345 --> 00:35:09,573
This dye is kind of chintzy.

370
00:35:09,597 --> 00:35:11,015
Well. You've gotta wait.

371
00:35:12,141 --> 00:35:13,809
Probably used too much vinegar.

372
00:35:17,521 --> 00:35:18,521
Where's daddy?

373
00:35:22,193 --> 00:35:24,278
Christine, can you get it for me?

374
00:35:29,075 --> 00:35:33,162
Hello? We're all here,
who do you want to talk to?

375
00:35:36,207 --> 00:35:37,309
I don't know, I can ask.

376
00:35:37,333 --> 00:35:39,043
Lydia? What time are you leaving?

377
00:35:40,378 --> 00:35:42,230
Not late. I don't wanna
be stuck in traffic.

378
00:35:42,254 --> 00:35:43,398
She says not late.

379
00:35:43,422 --> 00:35:44,858
Why don't you just stay over?

380
00:35:44,882 --> 00:35:45,693
We can't.

381
00:35:45,717 --> 00:35:47,277
I'll leave the key in the back.

382
00:35:47,301 --> 00:35:48,112
We have school tomorrow.

383
00:35:48,136 --> 00:35:49,363
We'll all be here.

384
00:35:49,855 --> 00:35:51,222
Maybe we can bring some home?

385
00:35:51,247 --> 00:35:52,457
Okay. Bye.

386
00:35:55,851 --> 00:35:57,971
- What do you think, Jesse?
- Want to bring them home?

387
00:35:58,354 --> 00:35:59,748
Well, that's kinda neat!

388
00:35:59,772 --> 00:36:01,899
Look at that. You can dye the paper towel.

389
00:36:02,900 --> 00:36:04,568
What are you drawing on the eggs?

390
00:36:05,945 --> 00:36:07,422
I'm gonna write my name.

391
00:36:07,446 --> 00:36:08,446
Exciting.

392
00:36:09,782 --> 00:36:12,010
I dunno. Where's the one you drew on?

393
00:36:12,034 --> 00:36:13,034
Oh! There it is.

394
00:36:13,839 --> 00:36:15,389
Here, give me that when you're ready.

395
00:36:15,413 --> 00:36:17,557
It's like a little mystery.

396
00:36:17,581 --> 00:36:19,375
I want the one in the blue.

397
00:36:28,342 --> 00:36:30,612
Jesse, could you come
in here for a minute?

398
00:36:30,636 --> 00:36:31,636
Why?

399
00:36:32,888 --> 00:36:34,140
We want to talk to you.

400
00:36:56,495 --> 00:36:58,581
Grandma Claire died yesterday.

401
00:37:00,833 --> 00:37:01,977
We never want you to forget

402
00:37:02,001 --> 00:37:04,670
how much she loved you and
how much you meant to her.

403
00:37:07,798 --> 00:37:10,444
Grandma Claire thought the world of you.

404
00:37:10,468 --> 00:37:11,760
Why did she die?

405
00:37:13,888 --> 00:37:17,242
Sometimes, when we get older,

406
00:37:17,266 --> 00:37:22,229
our bodies react to things in
ways that can be dangerous.

407
00:37:24,899 --> 00:37:28,628
Grandma was very sensitive to the heat.

408
00:37:28,652 --> 00:37:33,657
It made her very sick. Her heart failed.

409
00:37:35,784 --> 00:37:37,703
Grandma will always watch over you.

410
00:37:40,247 --> 00:37:43,209
Remember that. You understand?

411
00:37:45,002 --> 00:37:46,002
Yes.

412
00:37:48,297 --> 00:37:50,841
Okay. Go back to your show.

413
00:38:20,538 --> 00:38:22,349
Richard Damrosch would remark,

414
00:38:22,373 --> 00:38:25,018
on more than one occasion,
that the day he learned

415
00:38:25,042 --> 00:38:29,147
of his mother's death was
the worst day of his life.

416
00:38:29,171 --> 00:38:33,652
Claire Damrosch had lead a
selfless existence, and her life,

417
00:38:33,676 --> 00:38:36,822
like those of many other
women of her time and class,

418
00:38:36,846 --> 00:38:38,865
was lived unceremoniously,

419
00:38:38,889 --> 00:38:42,059
with a great many unacknowledged
toils and concessions.

420
00:38:43,143 --> 00:38:45,455
Her absence from Richard
and his sister's lives

421
00:38:45,479 --> 00:38:47,041
was something that neither of them

422
00:38:47,066 --> 00:38:49,360
would ever be able to fully comprehend.

423
00:39:02,454 --> 00:39:04,623
There's. There's a...

424
00:39:17,295 --> 00:39:19,388
It's supposed to run down to the end.

425
00:39:40,565 --> 00:39:42,108
They don't want you to go in.

426
00:39:44,913 --> 00:39:46,349
It was strange.

427
00:39:46,373 --> 00:39:48,727
She was wearing one of her house dresses.

428
00:39:48,751 --> 00:39:50,628
It had yellow flowers on it.

429
00:42:46,261 --> 00:42:48,114
Richard and Lydia Damrosch

430
00:42:48,138 --> 00:42:51,159
separated in the spring of 1997.

431
00:42:51,183 --> 00:42:53,977
Their divorce went into
effect at the end of the year.

432
00:42:54,978 --> 00:42:57,332
At around this time, Lydia began seeing

433
00:42:57,356 --> 00:43:00,960
Peter Edward McMillan, a
doctor she met during her shift

434
00:43:00,984 --> 00:43:01,984
at the hospital.

435
00:43:03,153 --> 00:43:05,507
Peter would help Lydia find a new house,

436
00:43:05,531 --> 00:43:06,615
not far from Haylett.

437
00:43:07,533 --> 00:43:09,260
There, Jesse would begin his career

438
00:43:09,284 --> 00:43:11,179
as a middle school student,

439
00:43:11,203 --> 00:43:13,413
and he would visit his father on weekends.

440
00:43:43,443 --> 00:43:46,464
For his part, Richard remarried quickly.

441
00:43:46,488 --> 00:43:49,676
In a gesture of what
he called his goodwill,

442
00:43:49,700 --> 00:43:52,303
he agreed to a rather
unsentimental courtroom wedding

443
00:43:52,327 --> 00:43:55,306
with Judy Roberts, a
manicurist from Trinidad

444
00:43:55,330 --> 00:43:57,100
who had been living in the United States

445
00:43:57,124 --> 00:43:58,667
for the past two years.

446
00:43:59,501 --> 00:44:02,504
They met in the personals
section of a weekly newspaper.

447
00:44:03,714 --> 00:44:06,317
The marriage would allow
Judy to become a U.S. citizen

448
00:44:06,341 --> 00:44:08,069
and reunite with her daughter,

449
00:44:08,093 --> 00:44:10,804
whom she said she had
not seen in five years.

450
00:44:20,731 --> 00:44:22,274
Can I have some lunch money?

451
00:44:27,487 --> 00:44:28,487
Here.

452
00:44:33,035 --> 00:44:35,537
Your mother can't say I
never gave you anything.

453
00:45:36,765 --> 00:45:38,600
Hello, hello, hello?

454
00:45:41,645 --> 00:45:43,689
Nothing's easy. Let's go.

455
00:45:45,949 --> 00:45:47,168
Where are we going to stay?

456
00:45:47,192 --> 00:45:48,353
We're not staying anywhere.

457
00:45:48,378 --> 00:45:50,504
They booked all the hotels. Jude, come on.

458
00:46:02,708 --> 00:46:05,436
Next time you order meat,
make sure it's well done, okay?

459
00:46:05,460 --> 00:46:06,272
Why?

460
00:46:06,296 --> 00:46:08,022
Always request things well done.

461
00:46:08,046 --> 00:46:09,857
Because that's how people get sick.

462
00:46:09,881 --> 00:46:10,881
Here, Jude.

463
00:46:11,842 --> 00:46:14,362
Look what happened to that
little girl in Virginia. Okay?

464
00:46:14,386 --> 00:46:16,364
Family takes her out to a restaurant

465
00:46:16,388 --> 00:46:18,908
to celebrate her birthday, and she dies.

466
00:46:18,932 --> 00:46:21,059
She gets E. Coli and she dies.

467
00:46:24,438 --> 00:46:26,290
That's not the restaurant's fault.

468
00:46:26,314 --> 00:46:30,211
- Not the restaurant's fault?
- These people don't care.

469
00:46:30,235 --> 00:46:31,921
They could care less about you and me.

470
00:46:31,945 --> 00:46:32,881
Which is why I am telling you now

471
00:46:32,905 --> 00:46:36,050
and will continue to tell you
that you can't trust anyone.

472
00:46:36,074 --> 00:46:37,200
Isn't that right, Jude?

473
00:46:38,285 --> 00:46:39,887
Right.

474
00:46:39,911 --> 00:46:43,975
Here. Restaurant silverware is dirty.

475
00:46:43,999 --> 00:46:45,042
It's better this way.

476
00:46:49,338 --> 00:46:50,338
Isn't that right, Jude?

477
00:46:52,507 --> 00:46:54,402
You hear that buzzing noise?

478
00:46:54,426 --> 00:46:56,136
It's not a joke, Jude.

479
00:46:57,387 --> 00:46:59,139
Ah. There it goes again!

480
00:47:00,182 --> 00:47:01,242
Bzz. Bzz.

481
00:47:01,266 --> 00:47:03,393
You don't know how
clean restaurants are.

482
00:47:04,561 --> 00:47:06,021
That's how your Uncle Joseph died.

483
00:47:07,230 --> 00:47:10,567
I heard Uncle Joseph
died from something else.

484
00:47:11,526 --> 00:47:12,920
Who told you that?

485
00:47:12,944 --> 00:47:15,864
Andrew. He said it
was some other disease.

486
00:47:17,407 --> 00:47:18,885
Like what?

487
00:47:18,909 --> 00:47:20,118
Some kind of virus.

488
00:47:23,955 --> 00:47:25,457
I'll tell you when you're older.

489
00:47:53,360 --> 00:47:57,006
Mr. Speaker. Mr. Vice President.

490
00:47:57,030 --> 00:48:01,034
Members of Congress, honored
guests, my fellow Americans.

491
00:48:02,994 --> 00:48:07,290
We are fortune to be alive
at this moment in history.

492
00:48:41,616 --> 00:48:44,262
You guys haven't
actually met Peter, right?

493
00:48:44,286 --> 00:48:45,555
No, no. This is the first time.

494
00:48:45,579 --> 00:48:47,390
This is Betsy.

495
00:48:47,414 --> 00:48:48,891
Nice to meet you.

496
00:48:48,915 --> 00:48:50,143
I've told her entirely
too much about you.

497
00:48:50,167 --> 00:48:51,167
So much!

498
00:48:52,210 --> 00:48:53,210
Steve.

499
00:48:54,880 --> 00:48:55,898
This is Sue.

500
00:48:55,922 --> 00:48:58,276
Hi, how are you!

501
00:48:58,300 --> 00:48:59,861
That's Dan.

502
00:48:59,885 --> 00:49:01,469
Nice to meet you.

503
00:49:01,955 --> 00:49:03,355
Okay, I've told everyone about you.

504
00:49:04,014 --> 00:49:08,810
Don't get too excited! You
don't know what I've said.

505
00:49:15,859 --> 00:49:18,069
Hon. What do you think
is going to happen?

506
00:49:24,868 --> 00:49:25,845
Do you think your father

507
00:49:25,869 --> 00:49:27,662
is going to do something to upset you?

508
00:49:30,207 --> 00:49:33,603
It's strange. They're going
to be in the same room again.

509
00:49:33,627 --> 00:49:37,422
Grandma and Grandpa know
he's going to be here. Okay?

510
00:49:39,049 --> 00:49:41,986
We're all going to be
on our best behavior.

511
00:49:42,010 --> 00:49:44,405
I'm worried he'll say something.

512
00:49:44,429 --> 00:49:46,032
Like what?

513
00:49:46,056 --> 00:49:47,307
I don't know.

514
00:49:49,518 --> 00:49:51,269
I'm worried they'll start a fight.

515
00:49:55,398 --> 00:49:59,861
No, no. Your Dad is not
going to start a fight.

516
00:50:00,779 --> 00:50:03,114
This is your confirmation, okay?

517
00:50:04,824 --> 00:50:05,992
We all love you.

518
00:50:08,411 --> 00:50:12,874
We just want you to have
a good time, I promise.

519
00:50:16,545 --> 00:50:21,549
Great day today. Great
day today, he looks great.

520
00:50:23,260 --> 00:50:26,513
How are you, pal? It's good to see you.

521
00:50:28,473 --> 00:50:31,643
You feelin' good today? You look good.

522
00:50:44,114 --> 00:50:45,967
Hello! Thank you.

523
00:50:45,991 --> 00:50:49,720
It's great to be here to celebrate
Jesse's confirmation day.

524
00:50:49,744 --> 00:50:50,996
Let's see who's here.

525
00:50:52,872 --> 00:50:54,684
Hey! There's Lydia and Richard!

526
00:50:54,708 --> 00:50:56,519
You're right! Jesse's parents are here.

527
00:50:56,543 --> 00:50:59,730
So how about a big round
of applause for them?

528
00:50:59,754 --> 00:51:01,423
Now, who else?

529
00:51:02,674 --> 00:51:04,277
What about that guy over there?

530
00:51:04,301 --> 00:51:05,987
Which guy? You know!

531
00:51:06,011 --> 00:51:07,989
I don't! The doctor!

532
00:51:08,013 --> 00:51:09,156
Oh, you mean Peter?

533
00:51:09,180 --> 00:51:11,117
Yes, the doctor, that's what I said!

534
00:51:11,141 --> 00:51:14,328
His name is Peter, and he's
Jesse's stepfather, okay?

535
00:51:14,352 --> 00:51:16,956
So, how about some applause for Peter?

536
00:51:16,980 --> 00:51:19,375
You know what they say about him?

537
00:51:19,399 --> 00:51:20,459
What do you mean?

538
00:51:20,483 --> 00:51:21,568
You didn't hear?

539
00:51:22,444 --> 00:51:23,754
No.

540
00:51:23,778 --> 00:51:25,631
Well.

541
00:51:25,655 --> 00:51:26,924
Go on.

542
00:51:26,948 --> 00:51:30,511
No, I can't do it. I won't say it.

543
00:51:30,535 --> 00:51:32,722
Now, wait a minute, now you,

544
00:51:32,746 --> 00:51:35,957
wait a minute, wait a minute, come on.

545
00:51:38,434 --> 00:51:39,494
You brought me up here

546
00:51:39,518 --> 00:51:41,579
in front of all these nice people

547
00:51:41,603 --> 00:51:42,913
and the very least you could do

548
00:51:42,937 --> 00:51:45,833
is tell me what it is that
you were going to say!

549
00:51:45,857 --> 00:51:50,880
Well, it's just that he
went to Atlantic City, see?

550
00:51:50,904 --> 00:51:51,881
Okay.

551
00:51:51,905 --> 00:51:55,259
And he had a few drinks, see?

552
00:51:55,283 --> 00:51:56,178
Okay.

553
00:51:56,202 --> 00:51:57,178
Well, then...

554
00:51:57,202 --> 00:51:58,202
Well, go on!

555
00:52:04,667 --> 00:52:07,563
They sued him for statutory rape!

556
00:52:07,587 --> 00:52:09,732
They sued him for statutory rape?

557
00:52:09,756 --> 00:52:14,093
Yeah. He was so drunk, he
didn't know it was a statue!

558
00:52:44,666 --> 00:52:46,000
Jesse, come here.

559
00:52:49,546 --> 00:52:50,546
Come on.

560
00:52:54,509 --> 00:52:58,030
You've been spending too
much time with those people.

561
00:52:58,054 --> 00:53:00,223
Clean all this away.

562
00:53:03,977 --> 00:53:06,831
Congratulations, Jesse. Congratulations!

563
00:53:06,855 --> 00:53:11,669
Best of luck to you.

564
00:53:11,693 --> 00:53:15,613
- Congratulations, Jesse.
- We're all very proud.

565
00:53:24,247 --> 00:53:26,583
Will you please excuse me?

566
00:53:28,001 --> 00:53:29,001
Why you so late?

567
00:53:46,978 --> 00:53:48,021
Can you look at me?

568
00:53:52,525 --> 00:53:54,027
Okay, you can stand up.

569
00:53:56,946 --> 00:53:58,716
Jesse's
graduation from middle school

570
00:53:58,740 --> 00:54:01,010
had come at an especially
enterprising moment

571
00:54:01,034 --> 00:54:02,160
in the boy's life.

572
00:54:04,662 --> 00:54:06,932
He developed an interest in filmmaking,

573
00:54:06,956 --> 00:54:08,100
which his father encouraged

574
00:54:08,124 --> 00:54:11,085
by giving him a video
camera on his 13th birthday.

575
00:54:12,795 --> 00:54:15,149
He recorded indiscriminately,
although rarely,

576
00:54:15,173 --> 00:54:17,508
as a way to memorialize
the things around him.

577
00:54:18,676 --> 00:54:20,321
The many hours of moving images

578
00:54:20,345 --> 00:54:22,865
Jesse stored inside a
cabinet in Lydia's home

579
00:54:22,889 --> 00:54:26,327
reflected less an interest
in memory than in measure:

580
00:54:26,351 --> 00:54:28,370
for the great distance that had opened up

581
00:54:28,394 --> 00:54:31,498
between Jesse and the world
on the eve of his adolescence

582
00:54:31,522 --> 00:54:35,818
could now effectively be
scaled, by videotape and light.

583
00:55:04,514 --> 00:55:06,307
Summer's over.

584
00:55:07,433 --> 00:55:08,433
That's sad.

585
00:55:09,894 --> 00:55:12,081
What are you gonna do?

586
00:55:12,105 --> 00:55:14,500
We didn't even get to
go to the beach this year.

587
00:55:14,524 --> 00:55:15,335
Who wants to go to the beach

588
00:55:15,359 --> 00:55:16,734
with all those people getting bit?

589
00:55:19,404 --> 00:55:23,050
Isn't that terrible? That
young boy from Florida.

590
00:55:23,074 --> 00:55:26,220
Poor thing, eight years old. Coulda died.

591
00:55:26,244 --> 00:55:27,680
I heard.

592
00:55:27,704 --> 00:55:28,830
Yeah. Horrible.

593
00:55:31,054 --> 00:55:32,143
Why are all these people

594
00:55:32,167 --> 00:55:34,168
getting attacked by sharks this year?

595
00:55:36,087 --> 00:55:37,714
It's a crazy world we live in.

596
00:55:42,969 --> 00:55:45,155
I have been married 34 years.

597
00:55:45,179 --> 00:55:48,891
I have not been a perfect
man. I have made mistakes.

598
00:55:49,767 --> 00:55:51,912
But out of respect for my family,

599
00:55:51,936 --> 00:55:55,124
and out of a specific request
from the Levy's family,

600
00:55:55,148 --> 00:55:56,709
I am not going to share the details

601
00:55:56,733 --> 00:55:58,377
of my relationship with Chandra.

602
00:55:58,401 --> 00:56:01,130
And you know what? People understand that.

603
00:56:01,154 --> 00:56:03,132
Gary Condit on KOBR TV

604
00:56:03,156 --> 00:56:05,884
sounds much like Gary Condit on ABC TV,

605
00:56:05,908 --> 00:56:07,636
and in the pages of People Magazine,

606
00:56:07,660 --> 00:56:10,264
Vanity Fair, a local
magazine, even Newsweek.

607
00:56:10,288 --> 00:56:12,182
After months of silent running the married

608
00:56:12,206 --> 00:56:14,476
California Congressman
revealed to have had

609
00:56:14,500 --> 00:56:17,229
an intimate relationship with
missing Washington intern

610
00:56:17,253 --> 00:56:19,022
Chandra Levy, among others,

611
00:56:19,046 --> 00:56:20,917
was suddenly talking a
lot but saying little.

612
00:56:20,942 --> 00:56:22,276
Certainly less than he claimed

613
00:56:22,300 --> 00:56:23,610
he'd already told authorities,

614
00:56:23,634 --> 00:56:26,447
because they were the only ones
with a legal right to know.

615
00:56:26,471 --> 00:56:28,157
In a one hour 45 minute session

616
00:56:28,181 --> 00:56:31,034
with Newsweek's Michael Isikoff,
his longest interview yet,

617
00:56:31,058 --> 00:56:33,245
Condit complained that ABC's Connie Chung,

618
00:56:33,269 --> 00:56:35,038
hand-picked by his own advisors,

619
00:56:35,062 --> 00:56:37,583
was so focused on what he
called the sex question

620
00:56:37,607 --> 00:56:39,376
that he couldn't communicate how quote,

621
00:56:39,400 --> 00:56:41,211
saddened and heart-broken, unquote,

622
00:56:41,235 --> 00:56:43,571
he is over Chandra's disappearance.

623
00:56:53,122 --> 00:56:57,311
<i>All news, all the time.

00:56:57,335 --> 00:57:00,564
<i>You give us 22 minutes,

625
00:57:00,588 --> 00:57:01,399
<i>Good morning.</i>

00:57:01,423 --> 00:57:04,485
<i>64 degrees at eight o'clock,

628
00:57:05,343 --> 00:57:06,154
<i>Here's what's happening:</i>

629
00:57:06,178 --> 00:57:08,763
<i>It's primary day and the polls
are open in New York City...</i>

630
00:57:44,132 --> 00:57:45,484
By the end of Jesse's first year

631
00:57:45,508 --> 00:57:47,820
of high school, Lydia and Peter's son,

632
00:57:47,844 --> 00:57:50,680
Paul Michael McMillan, was born.

633
00:57:52,515 --> 00:57:55,577
The boy would enter the
world on inauspicious terms,

634
00:57:55,601 --> 00:57:58,914
deaf and in poor health,
requiring a revolving company

635
00:57:58,938 --> 00:58:01,291
of medical specialists and caretakers,

636
00:58:01,315 --> 00:58:02,626
and involving no shortage

637
00:58:02,650 --> 00:58:04,944
of new expenses and responsibilities.

638
00:58:06,195 --> 00:58:07,297
If she was ever pained

639
00:58:07,321 --> 00:58:09,508
by the news of her new son's condition,

640
00:58:09,532 --> 00:58:10,992
Lydia had scarcely shown it.

641
00:58:11,868 --> 00:58:13,887
But Peter had long expected other things

642
00:58:13,911 --> 00:58:15,597
for his first-born child,

643
00:58:15,621 --> 00:58:17,558
and his sadness during this period,

644
00:58:17,582 --> 00:58:20,769
coupled with a growing schism
between him and his stepson,

645
00:58:20,793 --> 00:58:23,296
had become a rather
delicate affair to manage.

646
00:58:27,800 --> 00:58:28,843
It's the other one.

647
00:58:31,093 --> 00:58:32,276
I don't see it.

648
00:58:32,306 --> 00:58:33,633
Try that.

649
00:58:34,458 --> 00:58:35,466
Click there.

650
00:58:35,501 --> 00:58:37,075
- Where?
- On the left.

651
00:58:53,979 --> 00:58:55,263
<i>My name is Daniel Pearl.</i>

652
00:58:55,287 --> 00:58:59,933
<i>I'm a Jewish American from
3545 Leon Canyon Road,</i>

653
00:58:59,957 --> 00:59:01,792
<i>Encino, California, USA.</i>

654
00:59:05,922 --> 00:59:06,899
Time's are tough.

655
00:59:06,923 --> 00:59:08,275
Don't throw those out.

656
00:59:08,299 --> 00:59:09,735
If I were you I'd borrow
as much as I can right now.

657
00:59:09,759 --> 00:59:10,759
How's your credit?

658
00:59:12,094 --> 00:59:13,363
Not good.

659
00:59:13,387 --> 00:59:14,639
Get a home equity loan.

660
00:59:15,514 --> 00:59:16,533
For what?

661
00:59:16,557 --> 00:59:17,567
I'm telling you.

662
00:59:17,592 --> 00:59:19,369
Get a home equity loan, start
looking into real estate.

663
00:59:19,393 --> 00:59:20,871
Now's the time to do it.

664
00:59:20,895 --> 00:59:22,711
Me and my friend Rory are
gonna start snatching up

665
00:59:22,735 --> 00:59:24,416
foreclosures and turning them around.

666
00:59:24,440 --> 00:59:25,626
You'll be sitting on a cash machine.

667
00:59:25,650 --> 00:59:27,169
What are you gonna do
when that doesn't work?

668
00:59:27,193 --> 00:59:28,170
It'll work!

669
00:59:28,194 --> 00:59:29,796
Either that, or start flipping IPOs.

670
00:59:29,820 --> 00:59:31,590
I guarantee you, everyone
that's doing this right now

671
00:59:31,614 --> 00:59:32,674
will tell you the same thing.

672
00:59:32,698 --> 00:59:35,135
The housing market's not
cooling off anytime soon.

673
00:59:35,159 --> 00:59:35,970
In six months, you'll have

674
00:59:35,994 --> 00:59:37,620
half a million in the bank easily.

675
00:59:39,664 --> 00:59:40,790
I gotta do something.

676
00:59:41,958 --> 00:59:43,585
It's not been a good year.

677
00:59:43,610 --> 00:59:45,896
You shouldn't have given
me all that money, Richard.

678
00:59:45,920 --> 00:59:46,946
I wanted to.

679
00:59:46,971 --> 00:59:48,732
You're too generous.

680
00:59:48,756 --> 00:59:51,652
Well, I already told Jesse the holidays

681
00:59:51,676 --> 00:59:53,904
aren't going to be what they used to.

682
00:59:53,928 --> 00:59:57,532
I can't keep going
outta my way for people.

683
00:59:57,556 --> 00:59:58,367
It's okay.

684
00:59:58,391 --> 00:59:59,202
I'm sure his grandparents

685
00:59:59,226 --> 01:00:01,227
will have lots of nice presents for him.

686
01:00:06,023 --> 01:00:09,127
We all can't have money
like Nick and Flora.

687
01:00:09,151 --> 01:00:11,380
Why do you think they have money?

688
01:00:11,404 --> 01:00:14,031
I've been to their house. They're rich.

689
01:00:23,541 --> 01:00:25,602
Richard's
many debts began to mount,

690
01:00:25,626 --> 01:00:28,170
and so, too, did the
changes to his industry.

691
01:00:29,046 --> 01:00:31,733
The shift from offset to digital printing

692
01:00:31,757 --> 01:00:33,902
had jeopardized the
more established methods

693
01:00:33,926 --> 01:00:35,862
by which Richard and
many printers like him

694
01:00:35,886 --> 01:00:37,531
earned their living.

695
01:00:37,555 --> 01:00:39,783
Unable to remain profitable,

696
01:00:39,807 --> 01:00:42,476
he closed his business
and filed for bankruptcy.

697
01:00:57,366 --> 01:00:59,344
You know, Jesse, you're
making things very difficult

698
01:00:59,368 --> 01:01:00,494
for your mother and me.

699
01:01:02,718 --> 01:01:03,719
And I don't like it.

700
01:01:49,835 --> 01:01:53,148
<i>News. Now take it off, and show it off.</i>

711
01:02:49,395 --> 01:02:52,124
<i>traffic police were trying
to clear people off the road</i>

712
01:02:52,148 --> 01:02:53,542
<i>so that ambulances and cars</i>

713
01:02:53,566 --> 01:02:55,627
<i>and police cars could get through.</i>

714
01:02:55,651 --> 01:02:57,087
<i>We also know that there are people</i>

715
01:02:57,111 --> 01:02:59,089
<i>streaming out of Manhattan,
walking across the bridges,</i>

716
01:02:59,113 --> 01:03:01,258
<i>of course an image that
was reminiscent of 9/11,</i>

717
01:03:01,282 --> 01:03:02,467
<i>but for the most part Brian</i>

718
01:03:02,491 --> 01:03:04,427
<i>people are really taking this in stride.</i>

719
01:03:04,451 --> 01:03:08,372
<i>We do not see anything like
the panic we saw on 9/11...</i>

720
01:03:15,919 --> 01:03:17,440
Four more years!

721
01:03:17,464 --> 01:03:20,217
Four more years! Four more years!

722
01:03:25,389 --> 01:03:29,578
<i>You can expect division
between the races if Kerry wins.</i>

723
01:03:29,602 --> 01:03:31,580
<i>You can expect a United Nations tax</i>

724
01:03:31,604 --> 01:03:33,874
<i>or a World tax if Kerry wins.</i>

725
01:03:33,898 --> 01:03:37,210
<i>You can expect affirmative
action if Kerry wins.</i>

726
01:03:37,234 --> 01:03:39,379
<i>You can expect free prescription drugs,</i>

727
01:03:39,403 --> 01:03:42,257
<i>not only for the elderly
but also for AIDS patients.</i>

728
01:03:42,281 --> 01:03:45,760
<i>You can expect the Boy Scouts
to be outlawed if Kerry wins.</i>

729
01:03:45,784 --> 01:03:49,097
<i>You can expect homeschooling
to be eliminated if Kerry wins.</i>

730
01:03:49,121 --> 01:03:51,266
<i>You can expect the complete
and total elimination</i>

731
01:03:51,290 --> 01:03:54,269
<i>of borders with Mexico if Kerry wins.</i>

732
01:03:54,293 --> 01:03:58,190
<i>You might see a movement to
seize all guns if Kerry wins,</i>

733
01:03:58,214 --> 01:04:00,650
<i>and ultimately you might
see the constitution itself</i>

734
01:04:00,674 --> 01:04:03,260
<i>rewritten if Kerry wins.</i>

735
01:04:21,654 --> 01:04:23,030
Take one, pass them back.

736
01:04:41,632 --> 01:04:42,760
<i>I'm presenting something</i>

737
01:04:42,785 --> 01:04:45,678
<i>that wasn't done by a
professional photographer.</i>

738
01:04:48,555 --> 01:04:50,158
<i>This is a picture that was taken</i>

739
01:04:50,182 --> 01:04:52,810
<i>of my father's apartment in 1989.</i>

740
01:04:54,770 --> 01:04:57,273
<i>The two women on the bed
are my mother's sisters.</i>

741
01:05:00,109 --> 01:05:02,045
<i>I'm not sure what they're talking about,</i>

742
01:05:02,069 --> 01:05:03,838
<i>or why they're there,</i>

743
01:05:03,862 --> 01:05:06,240
<i>but I've been thinking a
lot about this picture.</i>

744
01:05:09,368 --> 01:05:11,245
<i>Take a look at the floor for a moment.</i>

745
01:05:13,580 --> 01:05:16,559
<i>It's difficult to see,
but, there's something</i>

746
01:05:16,583 --> 01:05:19,312
<i>about the way the floors
in my father's apartment</i>

747
01:05:19,336 --> 01:05:22,214
<i>reflect light that has always
left an impression upon me.</i>

748
01:05:23,882 --> 01:05:26,069
<i>In fact, a lot of what I
remember about growing up</i>

749
01:05:26,093 --> 01:05:27,886
<i>has something to do with this light.</i>

750
01:05:29,138 --> 01:05:32,075
<i>You can see it in the reflection
on the bedroom window,</i>

751
01:05:32,099 --> 01:05:35,019
<i>and on the lower left
hand side of the bed.</i>

752
01:05:36,562 --> 01:05:40,024
<i>And it shows up on the desk,
near the back of the room too.</i>

753
01:05:43,694 --> 01:05:46,089
<i>I can't say I have many childhood memories</i>

754
01:05:46,113 --> 01:05:47,573
<i>that don't include daylight.</i>

755
01:05:48,699 --> 01:05:53,120
<i>I don't remember the lamps
or overhead lights very much.</i>

756
01:05:56,352 --> 01:05:59,292
<i>But I do remember what these windows
were like for me as a child,</i>

757
01:06:01,039 --> 01:06:03,585
<i>and I remember
the things I saw outside,</i>

758
01:06:04,340 --> 01:06:05,340
<i>across the street.</i>

759
01:06:08,052 --> 01:06:09,738
<i>When my parents divorced,</i>

760
01:06:09,762 --> 01:06:12,598
<i>my mother and I moved into a new house.</i>

761
01:06:14,224 --> 01:06:15,702
<i>The two women in this photo</i>

762
01:06:15,726 --> 01:06:18,020
<i>were never inside my
father's apartment again.</i>

763
01:06:20,070 --> 01:06:21,207
<i>I find it strange to think</i>

764
01:06:21,231 --> 01:06:23,376
<i>they were ever there in the first place,</i>

765
01:06:23,400 --> 01:06:26,278
<i>in the apartment that my
father still lives in.</i>

766
01:06:30,157 --> 01:06:31,454
<i>The room is still there.</i>

767
01:06:33,211 --> 01:06:34,661
<i>Even if the same people aren't.</i>

768
01:06:37,539 --> 01:06:40,477
<i>If you look closely, in
the back of the room,</i>

769
01:06:40,501 --> 01:06:43,730
<i>you can see something
on top of the radiator,</i>

770
01:06:43,754 --> 01:06:45,005
<i>near the pile of clothes.</i>

771
01:06:46,507 --> 01:06:47,800
<i>It's a baby monitor.</i>

772
01:06:50,844 --> 01:06:53,180
<i>When this photo was taken,
I was two years old.</i>

773
01:07:11,365 --> 01:07:12,616
Tell her what you took.

774
01:07:16,662 --> 01:07:18,038
Tell her, how much.

775
01:07:21,750 --> 01:07:23,043
Judy, is that true?

776
01:07:24,002 --> 01:07:25,430
$8,000!

777
01:07:27,375 --> 01:07:28,641
Gone.

778
01:07:32,428 --> 01:07:34,138
My brother's done a lot for you.

779
01:07:40,477 --> 01:07:44,231
Are you gonna tell
her about your daughter?

780
01:07:46,817 --> 01:07:47,901
There is no daughter.

781
01:07:52,406 --> 01:07:54,408
She wasn't gonna reunite with anyone.

782
01:07:57,703 --> 01:07:59,597
You don't have a daughter?

783
01:07:59,621 --> 01:08:01,558
Why don't you apologize to her?

784
01:08:01,582 --> 01:08:05,669
Apologize! For taking
advantage of my family.

785
01:08:08,547 --> 01:08:10,257
Why would you lie to us?

786
01:08:15,095 --> 01:08:17,598
I had to do what I had to do.

787
01:09:51,441 --> 01:09:52,651
What took you so long?

788
01:09:54,528 --> 01:09:56,256
Hi. Hi John, Hi Talia.

789
01:09:56,280 --> 01:09:58,591
So nice to see you. Hi, Rich.

790
01:09:58,615 --> 01:10:00,051
- Hello.
- Hi.

791
01:10:00,075 --> 01:10:01,076
Jesse, come here.

792
01:10:18,468 --> 01:10:20,095
Ah, uh, you know, uh-

793
01:10:23,015 --> 01:10:25,451
Something I want to say
is just how grateful

794
01:10:25,475 --> 01:10:27,561
Lydia and I are to see you all here.

795
01:10:28,520 --> 01:10:32,667
To have you join us today
to celebrate this wonderful,

796
01:10:32,691 --> 01:10:34,818
wonderful moment in Jesse's life.

797
01:10:36,236 --> 01:10:37,571
We're all so proud of you.

798
01:10:38,614 --> 01:10:41,033
Proud of the things you've
already accomplished,

799
01:10:42,409 --> 01:10:44,536
and proud to be your parents.

800
01:10:45,746 --> 01:10:49,892
Having you in our lives is the best gift

801
01:10:49,916 --> 01:10:52,294
a parent could ever have.

802
01:10:53,378 --> 01:10:54,397
You've given us so much.

803
01:10:54,421 --> 01:10:55,421
So much joy.

804
01:10:58,175 --> 01:11:02,322
I only wish that my mother,
your grandmother Claire,

805
01:11:02,346 --> 01:11:07,017
could be here with us right now.

806
01:11:10,062 --> 01:11:14,691
My mother, she was a wonderful
person, she loved you,

807
01:11:16,318 --> 01:11:18,171
she'd be so proud of you,

808
01:11:18,195 --> 01:11:20,572
and I know that she will
always watch over you.

809
01:11:25,077 --> 01:11:26,638
Jesse, we love you.

810
01:11:26,662 --> 01:11:28,705
We wish all the success in the world,

811
01:11:30,207 --> 01:11:31,392
you make us all so happy.

812
01:11:31,416 --> 01:11:32,416
Congratulations.

813
01:12:16,586 --> 01:12:21,591
Jesse? Listen, your father's upset.

814
01:12:23,802 --> 01:12:25,238
Why?

815
01:12:25,262 --> 01:12:26,925
He sees you've been
with your mother's family

816
01:12:26,949 --> 01:12:29,391
most of the night, he's hurt.

817
01:12:30,851 --> 01:12:33,204
I'm sorry, I don't like the
seating arrangement either.

818
01:12:33,228 --> 01:12:36,916
I know it's not your fault,
I just wanted to let you know.

819
01:12:36,940 --> 01:12:38,483
Maybe spend some time with him.

820
01:12:39,693 --> 01:12:42,505
Sure. I'll go over in a few minutes.

821
01:12:42,529 --> 01:12:44,716
I know he'll appreciate it.

822
01:12:44,740 --> 01:12:46,783
- Yeah.
- I'll see you inside.

823
01:14:07,280 --> 01:14:10,051
- Congratulations Jesse.
- We'll see you soon.

824
01:14:10,075 --> 01:14:11,844
Congratulations. Good luck in college.

825
01:14:11,868 --> 01:14:13,745
Jesse! Congratulations.

826
01:14:14,704 --> 01:14:19,060
Oh my god, good luck in
Chicago! So proud of you.

827
01:14:19,084 --> 01:14:21,753
Congratulations. Best of luck.

828
01:14:43,066 --> 01:14:48,071
What about me? Isn't anyone
going to say goodbye to me?

829
01:14:49,368 --> 01:14:51,050
Isn't anybody going to thank me?

830
01:14:51,074 --> 01:14:51,885
- What are you talking about?
- Rich...

831
01:14:51,909 --> 01:14:53,219
No one's gonna acknowledge me?

832
01:14:53,243 --> 01:14:54,470
Acknowledge what?

833
01:14:54,494 --> 01:14:55,305
Of course we are.

834
01:14:55,329 --> 01:14:56,597
You're not gonna say a word to me?

835
01:14:56,621 --> 01:14:58,432
You got nothing.

836
01:14:58,456 --> 01:14:59,308
Is that what you think?

837
01:14:59,332 --> 01:15:00,774
- Dad.
- Let's go.

838
01:15:00,799 --> 01:15:02,062
Okay, just, just...

839
01:15:02,086 --> 01:15:03,521
He's nothing, he'll always be that way.

840
01:15:03,545 --> 01:15:04,897
Get the fuck outta my face.

841
01:15:04,921 --> 01:15:05,857
Fuck you!

842
01:15:05,881 --> 01:15:06,817
You wanna make things difficult?

843
01:15:06,841 --> 01:15:07,984
Dad, stop.

844
01:15:08,008 --> 01:15:09,652
You say you're sorry to me.

845
01:15:09,676 --> 01:15:10,487
What am I sorry for?

846
01:15:10,511 --> 01:15:11,737
You say you're sorry to me!

847
01:15:11,761 --> 01:15:12,905
I'm not sorry for anything!

848
01:15:12,929 --> 01:15:14,115
Apologize to me!

849
01:15:14,139 --> 01:15:16,576
You should apologize to
my daughter and my grandson.

850
01:15:16,600 --> 01:15:17,702
You get the fuck outta here!

851
01:15:17,726 --> 01:15:19,186
You don't deserve your son.

852
01:15:22,793 --> 01:15:25,275
Oh my God, dad! Stop!
Stop it!

853
01:15:25,446 --> 01:15:27,977
Get off! Get off him!

854
01:15:28,002 --> 01:15:29,011
Get back.

855
01:15:31,406 --> 01:15:33,634
What is the matter with you?

856
01:15:33,658 --> 01:15:34,601
Get him out of here!

857
01:15:34,626 --> 01:15:35,904
Dad, go with them!

858
01:15:39,831 --> 01:15:41,926
You always ruin everything.

859
01:16:32,801 --> 01:16:34,820
Flora Orkins' mother Josephine

860
01:16:34,844 --> 01:16:38,240
died in a New Jersey
hospital at the age of 96,

861
01:16:38,264 --> 01:16:39,432
following a stroke.

862
01:16:40,475 --> 01:16:43,496
Funeral plans were made
quickly, and it was agreed

863
01:16:43,520 --> 01:16:46,040
that no public
announcements would be made:

864
01:16:46,064 --> 01:16:48,650
no death notices, no obituaries.

865
01:16:49,567 --> 01:16:51,879
The Orkins preferred to conceal the news

866
01:16:51,903 --> 01:16:55,549
from Josephine's son,
and, with some reluctance,

867
01:16:55,573 --> 01:16:57,450
Flora's sister Billie consented.

868
01:16:58,660 --> 01:17:01,121
Robert would never learn
that his mother had died.

869
01:17:39,868 --> 01:17:40,868
Where is she?

870
01:17:43,371 --> 01:17:45,558
When she arrived
at her mother's funeral,

871
01:17:45,582 --> 01:17:48,793
Billie Alloway had not seen
the Orkins in 15 years.

872
01:17:50,045 --> 01:17:51,588
The reunion was untimely.

873
01:17:55,894 --> 01:17:57,112
Keep me away from her.

874
01:17:57,136 --> 01:17:58,946
Mom, come inside.

875
01:17:58,970 --> 01:18:00,740
No. Not now.

876
01:18:00,764 --> 01:18:01,949
You can't ignore her today.

877
01:18:01,973 --> 01:18:03,409
You know what the situation is.

878
01:18:03,433 --> 01:18:04,869
I have my reasons.

879
01:18:04,893 --> 01:18:05,704
What are your reasons?

880
01:18:05,728 --> 01:18:06,705
Lydia, mind your own business.

881
01:18:06,729 --> 01:18:08,539
I never told you not to talk to them,

882
01:18:08,563 --> 01:18:10,041
if that's what you want to do then do it.

883
01:18:10,065 --> 01:18:11,792
Alright, alright.

884
01:18:11,816 --> 01:18:13,231
It's her mother too.

885
01:18:13,256 --> 01:18:14,637
We're keeping things as is.

886
01:18:14,662 --> 01:18:16,613
You're in no position
to tell me what to do.

887
01:18:17,906 --> 01:18:19,592
She's hurting.

888
01:18:19,616 --> 01:18:22,035
I'm sorry, but I can't
do anything about that.

889
01:18:26,039 --> 01:18:31,044
Jesse. Do you remember
Ted, and Aunt Billie?

890
01:18:32,087 --> 01:18:34,148
I do. Hi, Aunt Billie.

891
01:18:34,172 --> 01:18:37,234
Jesse. Hello.

892
01:18:37,258 --> 01:18:38,319
We last saw you in the-

893
01:18:38,343 --> 01:18:42,722
- In the Bahamas. And he was so little.

894
01:18:45,392 --> 01:18:47,977
I'm going to go grab Peter. Take a seat.

895
01:18:55,318 --> 01:18:56,318
Jesse.

896
01:18:59,364 --> 01:19:01,825
I wish things had turned out differently.

897
01:19:06,454 --> 01:19:07,932
Will they be joining you?

898
01:19:07,956 --> 01:19:10,375
No. We go our separate ways.

899
01:19:18,716 --> 01:19:21,970
This isn't goodbye. It's not goodbye.

900
01:19:37,277 --> 01:19:38,277
Nick.

901
01:19:39,779 --> 01:19:40,780
Billie. I'm sorry.

902
01:19:47,871 --> 01:19:48,871
Ted.

903
01:19:57,005 --> 01:20:00,008
Flora. What did I do wrong?

904
01:20:01,968 --> 01:20:06,639
Can't we just make peace now?

905
01:21:39,566 --> 01:21:41,835
By the time of
Josephine's death, Jesse had

906
01:21:41,859 --> 01:21:45,589
finished his first semester
of college, in Chicago.

907
01:21:45,613 --> 01:21:48,133
He had returned to Lydia's
home for the winter recess,

908
01:21:48,157 --> 01:21:49,409
when he learned the news.

909
01:21:50,535 --> 01:21:52,513
As the new school semester began,

910
01:21:52,537 --> 01:21:55,391
Jesse's father would be beset
by an unexpected torrent

911
01:21:55,415 --> 01:21:58,018
of legal bills and lawyer fees.

912
01:21:58,042 --> 01:21:59,728
His relationship with Judy had ended

913
01:21:59,752 --> 01:22:02,356
on less than amicable
terms, and it is said

914
01:22:02,380 --> 01:22:05,800
that she left New York comfortably,
her whereabouts unknown.

915
01:22:07,218 --> 01:22:09,196
Some years later, Jesse discovered

916
01:22:09,220 --> 01:22:11,949
that he was not Richard's
first-born child,

917
01:22:11,973 --> 01:22:13,867
he had a daughter in Atlanta,

918
01:22:13,891 --> 01:22:16,078
born after the end of a
previous relationship,

919
01:22:16,102 --> 01:22:18,479
10 years before his marriage to Lydia.

920
01:22:19,564 --> 01:22:22,126
In a photo album, Jesse
would find a letter

921
01:22:22,150 --> 01:22:24,027
that his father had written to Lydia.

922
01:22:24,986 --> 01:22:27,613
"I'm sorry for the way
I treated you," it said.

923
01:22:28,615 --> 01:22:30,551
"If I can be honest, Lydia,"

924
01:22:30,575 --> 01:22:32,952
I'm unhappy with the way
my life has turned out.

925
01:23:34,305 --> 01:23:35,985
Too bad you didn't
bring the other color.

926
01:23:51,239 --> 01:23:52,383
I can't do it with my left hand!

927
01:23:52,407 --> 01:23:53,616
You want me to help?

928
01:23:57,537 --> 01:24:00,123
This is good as it will
drive a little bit faster.

929
01:24:08,464 --> 01:24:11,153
I saw, there were so
many near the entrance.

930
01:24:11,178 --> 01:24:13,654
- We're gonna call the management.
- Try to get rid of them.

931
01:24:13,678 --> 01:24:14,655
What a shame.

932
01:24:14,679 --> 01:24:16,865
They put the poison down all
over the top of the building.

933
01:24:16,889 --> 01:24:18,700
Why are they doing that?

934
01:24:18,724 --> 01:24:21,537
Birds. Tenant's don't
want them on the property.

935
01:24:21,561 --> 01:24:22,937
Just take it for tomorrow.

936
01:24:24,021 --> 01:24:25,666
Did you walk far?

937
01:24:25,690 --> 01:24:27,376
No, just down the street.

938
01:24:27,400 --> 01:24:28,651
It's very windy today.

939
01:24:29,735 --> 01:24:30,796
You've got your bag?

940
01:24:30,820 --> 01:24:32,321
It's in the car.

941
01:24:34,657 --> 01:24:36,176
Well. Let's go.

942
01:24:36,200 --> 01:24:38,512
I know, you keep telling
me, I'll do it, I'll do it.

943
01:24:38,536 --> 01:24:39,304
Bye, honey.

944
01:24:39,328 --> 01:24:40,140
Bye, daddy.

945
01:24:40,164 --> 01:24:41,265
Bye, bye.

946
01:24:41,289 --> 01:24:42,641
Thank you so much. Drive safely!

947
01:24:42,665 --> 01:24:44,333
Thanks for coming.

948
01:24:45,710 --> 01:24:46,961
Bye, darling.

949
01:24:51,007 --> 01:24:52,109
Bye, mom.

950
01:24:52,133 --> 01:24:53,986
Perfect, everything was perfect.

951
01:24:54,010 --> 01:24:55,696
Make sure he puts on his seat belt!

952
01:24:55,720 --> 01:24:58,907
Thank you, sweetie!

953
01:24:58,931 --> 01:25:00,826
Thank you so much! Thank you for coming.

954
01:25:00,850 --> 01:25:02,828
Take care, darling, bye bye.

955
01:25:02,852 --> 01:25:03,852
Drive safely.

956
01:25:13,780 --> 01:25:16,866
Jesse! Come say goodbye.
