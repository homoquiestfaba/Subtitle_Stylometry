1
00:00:22,030 --> 00:00:24,788
There is pleasure in the forests without path
There is enchantment in the solitary bank

2
00:00:24,932 --> 00:00:28,127
There is society, where nobody interferes
There is music in the bellow of the sea

3
00:00:29,047 --> 00:00:31,350
Not it is that he/she doesn't love the man, but to
the Nature the master more. Lord Byron.

4
00:00:50,062 --> 00:00:52,662
- That it happens?
- It was in the river... 

5
00:00:53,148 --> 00:00:59,587
I didn't imagine it, him
I listened, I listened Chris... 

6
00:01:00,247 --> 00:01:08,337
- You imagined it sky.
- No, I didn't imagine it, I listened to it... 

7
00:01:40,772 --> 00:01:50,292
Wayne, Greetings from Fairbanks!

8
00:01:50,327 --> 00:01:57,243
I arrived here two days ago.

9
00:01:57,278 --> 00:02:06,443
It is very difficult that give you a
aventón in the area of Yukon,

10
00:02:15,372 --> 00:02:18,750
But finally I arrived here.

11
00:02:18,785 --> 00:02:26,398
I bought a new book Preposition
of the flora and fauna locals.

12
00:02:26,433 --> 00:02:36,609
I have prepared and stored all the necessary one for
to live outside of the civilization for some months.

13
00:02:36,644 --> 00:02:44,004
Perhaps pass a long time
before he/she returns to the South.

14
00:02:47,667 --> 00:02:53,879
I only want you to know
that you are a great man.

15
00:02:53,914 --> 00:02:56,986
Closed by the winter.

16
00:03:36,678 --> 00:03:40,522
- It seems that we have arrived!
- Well, thank you.

17
00:03:53,504 --> 00:03:57,852
- That sure it would damage my back.
- Yes indeed.

18
00:03:58,831 --> 00:04:02,326
Thank you again.

19
00:04:03,258 --> 00:04:05,900
Hey, waits a moment.

20
00:04:09,324 --> 00:04:17,204
He/she takes this, they will maintain your dry feet, any
problem calls me, the number is inside the boots.

21
00:04:17,857 --> 00:04:20,031
Thank you.

22
00:04:48,257 --> 00:04:53,149
Now I began to walk... 

23
00:04:58,003 --> 00:05:07,164
 ... TOWARD THE WILD THING.

24
00:08:56,690 --> 00:08:59,407
Hello... 

25
00:10:03,502 --> 00:10:07,501
Is somebody here?

26
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:12,431
That he/she comes from front!

27
00:11:20,050 --> 00:11:23,193
Two years to be here.

28
00:11:29,133 --> 00:11:34,451
Without telephone, neither cars,
neither remain silent, neither cigarettes... 

29
00:11:52,118 --> 00:11:54,495
But that doesn't scare me.

30
00:11:55,388 --> 00:12:06,002
It is another form of life,
the challenge is to be grown.

31
00:12:06,037 --> 00:12:12,097
Old man listen, I won't take that turn.
Be quiet that doesn't let me see for where I go.

32
00:12:12,132 --> 00:12:19,629
- Where go?
- I already told it to him we don't go anywhere!

33
00:12:19,664 --> 00:12:26,970
And now after two years here,
finally the great adventure arrives.

34
00:12:27,005 --> 00:12:40,515
The romantic battle of killing the reinforcement to be
interior, and to find the revolutionary spirit.

35
00:13:08,157 --> 00:13:13,203
Not more being poisoned for
the thought of escaping.

36
00:13:13,238 --> 00:13:20,929
And while in route to the long thing of
this earth, I get lost in the wild thing.

37
00:13:22,366 --> 00:13:28,577
Alexander Supertramp. May of 1992.

38
00:13:34,410 --> 00:13:38,450
University of Emory, Atlanta Georgia.
Two years before the "Magic" bus... 

39
00:13:50,793 --> 00:13:56,346
We are here for those that honor to
the nation with the merit of the study.

40
00:13:56,889 --> 00:14:03,179
All will be stepping earth more
firm, with the power the knowledge.

41
00:14:10,284 --> 00:14:13,118
Nina Glen Lockwin.

42
00:14:18,164 --> 00:14:22,203
Vanessa Denise Lowrie.

43
00:14:25,465 --> 00:14:29,735
Christopher Jhonson McAndles.

44
00:14:40,334 --> 00:14:44,459
Regina Victoria McNabb.

45
00:15:06,558 --> 00:15:10,456
I can see them to the doors
of their University.

46
00:15:13,416 --> 00:15:21,690
I see my father greeting under the stone arch,
the red potteries as blood are behind their head.

47
00:15:21,725 --> 00:15:29,079
I do my mother with some books in
their hands, in the patio of recesses,

48
00:15:29,114 --> 00:15:34,475
the doors of grills are still open
behind her. They are black as their hair.

49
00:15:34,510 --> 00:15:37,660
They are about to graduate.

50
00:15:37,695 --> 00:15:40,004
They are about to marry.

51
00:15:40,039 --> 00:15:42,999
They are only some boys, they are silly.

52
00:15:43,034 --> 00:15:49,362
All that you/they know is of its
innocence, they will never harm to anybody

53
00:15:49,397 --> 00:15:52,001
I want to run to them
and to tell them: "Give birth to!"

54
00:15:52,036 --> 00:15:53,478
Don't make it.

55
00:15:53,490 --> 00:15:55,432
She is the mistaken woman.

56
00:15:55,532 --> 00:15:57,800
He is the mistaken man.

57
00:15:57,835 --> 00:16:01,372
Van to make things that
they have never imagined.

58
00:16:01,407 --> 00:16:04,712
They will make bad things to their children.

59
00:16:04,747 --> 00:16:10,381
Van to suffer eats they never have
listened before. Van to want to die.

60
00:16:11,740 --> 00:16:17,136
I want to go until them and to tell them
all this, but I don't make it.

61
00:16:18,147 --> 00:16:20,477
I want to live.

62
00:16:21,758 --> 00:16:31,743
The volume like to paper puppets and them together
for the hips, and while I make it, I say:

63
00:16:31,778 --> 00:16:34,655
"Make what you/they have to make"

64
00:16:34,690 --> 00:16:37,567
"And I will say of it. "

65
00:16:37,602 --> 00:16:40,445
Are OK already here?

66
00:16:41,004 --> 00:16:43,217
That foolishness!

67
00:16:43,252 --> 00:16:47,721
Good, it could not be more
that what certain was?

68
00:16:47,756 --> 00:16:51,760
Because he/she has to come managing?

69
00:16:51,795 --> 00:16:59,229
There are big poems in this book.

70
00:16:59,264 --> 00:17:04,122
I have to talk him/her about this.

71
00:17:04,157 --> 00:17:08,356
Forgive. He/she is my son he/she has just graduated.

72
00:17:09,479 --> 00:17:19,069
Hey, hello. We were waiting
and waiting. You had me afraid.

73
00:17:19,104 --> 00:17:22,446
- Hello dad.
- Congratulations son, this it is a great step.

74
00:17:22,481 --> 00:17:24,932
Thank you dad.

75
00:17:27,572 --> 00:17:30,873
- It is not supposed that you manage in Georgia.
- Because? I have my permission.

76
00:17:30,908 --> 00:17:36,424
It is illegal that minors manage
in a state that is not his.

77
00:17:36,459 --> 00:17:40,540
He/she didn't know it, I obtained that permission legally,
it should not have any problem.

78
00:17:51,013 --> 00:17:53,848
- Do they work here?
- No.

79
00:17:56,022 --> 00:17:58,778
It seems that all the one
world is of party today.

80
00:17:58,813 --> 00:18:02,545
- That they stay there correct?
- If Sr.

81
00:18:14,311 --> 00:18:18,077
It would be grandiose if he/she could
to make a graduate degree of laws.

82
00:18:18,112 --> 00:18:21,066
Chris that is wonderful.

83
00:18:21,101 --> 00:18:24,094
It is a great desición.

84
00:18:24,129 --> 00:18:27,202
Will all cost the entrance?

85
00:18:27,237 --> 00:18:34,345
- Exactly 24500.68 dollars.
- Good, it is affordable.

86
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:43,819
- Your mother and I would be charmed of contributing with you for it.
- It is this way.

87
00:18:43,854 --> 00:18:49,579
I will leave when it finishes here,
I have a lot to pack and to organize.

88
00:18:49,614 --> 00:18:54,896
Your father and I want
to make you a present.

89
00:18:54,931 --> 00:18:57,964
We want that you
undo of that pot.

90
00:18:57,999 --> 00:19:03,595
- That pot?
- That of there.

91
00:19:03,630 --> 00:19:07,244
We will buy you a new car.

92
00:19:07,279 --> 00:19:10,544
A new car?

93
00:19:10,579 --> 00:19:16,965
Because he/she would want a car
new? That is very well.

94
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:22,051
I mean to my I love this.

95
00:19:22,086 --> 00:19:26,090
Did they hope he/she gave jumps of happiness?

96
00:19:26,125 --> 00:19:34,592
We only thought that we should give you a beautiful one
car, surer, that thing could explode.

97
00:19:34,627 --> 00:19:45,928
To explode! To explode? They are crazy, it is a great one
car. Not I need a new car. And I don't want it.

98
00:19:45,963 --> 00:19:52,256
Not I want any thing, of
these things and things and things... 

99
00:19:52,291 --> 00:19:54,120
- Everything has to be to the difficult thing!
- Thank you.

100
00:19:54,155 --> 00:20:07,591
- He/she only says that he/she wants their old car, it is not the great thing.
- Thank you, alone I said what felt.

101
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:20,597
Chris was manufactured himself a recubrimiento of
coldness that surrounded it. Good-bye Chris!

102
00:20:20,632 --> 00:20:30,148
He/she was always amid a road
solitary, but it found company in their books.

103
00:20:30,183 --> 00:20:35,817
Of authors like Tolstoy,
Jack London and others.

104
00:20:35,852 --> 00:20:40,552
He/she found in them words
applicable to any occasion.

105
00:20:44,321 --> 00:20:47,970
To Pay Oxfam America.

106
00:20:57,169 --> 00:21:01,906
I forgot to ask him/her that it mentions he/she had chosen
to say in their discruso of graduate.

107
00:21:01,941 --> 00:21:08,329
He/she had a good idea of
which will be their target.

108
00:21:10,733 --> 00:21:15,432
It was a fact that Chris will escape.

109
00:21:15,467 --> 00:21:21,644
And when he/she made it, he/she went him/her
to put their distinctive stamp.

110
00:21:27,281 --> 00:21:30,728
Chapter 1: My own birth.

111
00:22:05,645 --> 00:22:09,605
He/she should not refuse that to be
we are always glad escaping.

112
00:22:11,121 --> 00:22:14,692
When our intention
he/she associates with the escape.

113
00:22:14,727 --> 00:22:20,517
I achieved with the loan
to stuff some forms.

114
00:22:20,578 --> 00:22:24,112
That focused me in my objective.

115
00:22:24,147 --> 00:22:28,499
The road is always the first step.

116
00:22:28,534 --> 00:22:31,100
FLOOD.

117
00:23:38,929 --> 00:23:42,812
Lake Urinates, Arizona Julio 1990.

118
00:23:47,673 --> 00:23:50,818
Wild eatable fruits.

119
00:24:27,177 --> 00:24:30,671
I need a name.

120
00:24:34,167 --> 00:24:37,583
Alexander Supertramp. Julio 1990.

121
00:24:57,984 --> 00:25:04,661
For the end of June the crises
world they were increased. Almost all them.

122
00:25:05,399 --> 00:25:08,986
The Apartheid in the South African society.

123
00:25:09,021 --> 00:25:14,461
The civil confrontations and
the crisis of food in Africa.

124
00:25:16,442 --> 00:25:19,045
Clever boy my brother!

125
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:23,120
For Julio's end not
we had had news of him.

126
00:25:23,155 --> 00:25:27,196
My parents would become annoying.

127
00:25:27,231 --> 00:25:33,914
Chris was never here, so,
he/she decided to leave to the planet of the surprises.

128
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:54,451
When they arrived to the apartment the landlord
he/she said that Chris had left at the end of May.

129
00:25:57,051 --> 00:26:04,350
And when they arrived home I found them with
the letters that you/they had sent that summer.

130
00:26:04,385 --> 00:26:08,117
And they had been returned
to the addressee.

131
00:26:08,152 --> 00:26:12,621
Chris had made an arrangement in the mail
so that they retained them up to August 1ro,

132
00:26:12,656 --> 00:26:15,806
and this way to win some time.

133
00:26:15,841 --> 00:26:21,551
- Do you know something about this?
- He/she didn't tell me anything.

134
00:26:21,586 --> 00:26:23,996
He/she understood what was making.

135
00:26:24,031 --> 00:26:30,248
It lost 4 years with the absurdity and
tedious study in the academy.

136
00:26:31,801 --> 00:26:40,189
And now it was wanted to be left that low world the
it influences the parents and the excess of things materials.

137
00:26:41,745 --> 00:26:47,296
The things that separated Chris
of their true existence.

138
00:26:53,275 --> 00:26:56,964
On the way to the crest of the I pacify,
North of California. August of 1990.

139
00:28:05,575 --> 00:28:08,713
Hey boy, an aventón? Mount you.

140
00:28:09,414 --> 00:28:12,130
I sit down to laugh for that
crazy hat that you take.

141
00:28:13,878 --> 00:28:16,052
Up!

142
00:28:19,547 --> 00:28:23,973
- This is Rady, I am Jane.
- Hello, I am Alex.

143
00:28:24,008 --> 00:28:27,833
- Looking for adventure hey?
- If.

144
00:28:29,346 --> 00:28:31,831
So you are a radical.

145
00:28:31,866 --> 00:28:34,122
Am I it?

146
00:28:34,157 --> 00:28:39,496
They are called this way to those
that they decide to go on foot.

147
00:28:41,980 --> 00:28:48,308
- For that reason we have this vehicle... 
- We go, please.

148
00:28:49,900 --> 00:28:55,840
Good, Alex also had his vehicle,
but he/she decided to burn all their money.

149
00:28:56,966 --> 00:28:58,907
Because you made that?

150
00:29:00,964 --> 00:29:02,960
Not I need money.

151
00:29:02,995 --> 00:29:06,702
He/she makes people to be cautious.

152
00:29:06,737 --> 00:29:13,105
We go Alex, it is always necessary to be cautious,
the books won't be good you for everything.

153
00:29:17,029 --> 00:29:17,062
Not you will be able to stay with the help of bay.

154
00:29:17,097 --> 00:29:21,736
Not I know if I want to depend of more than that.

155
00:29:21,771 --> 00:29:27,093
Where your parents are?

156
00:29:27,128 --> 00:29:31,922
Living their lives in some part.

157
00:29:31,957 --> 00:29:35,999
Your parents love you, you exactly.

158
00:29:36,034 --> 00:29:37,746
That it is exactly?

159
00:29:37,781 --> 00:29:40,736
You taste like what I refer.

160
00:29:42,444 --> 00:29:45,747
They feel love... 

161
00:29:45,782 --> 00:29:54,095
 ... for the money, the
fame, the good things... 

162
00:29:56,424 --> 00:29:59,268
That is the true.

163
00:30:19,431 --> 00:30:25,138
Since Chris and I have reason use,
there were always episodes of fury at home.

164
00:30:25,173 --> 00:30:28,982
Violence that we were
forced to witness.

165
00:30:29,017 --> 00:30:32,516
He/she played us very inside.

166
00:30:32,551 --> 00:30:41,899
But, it was also as theater. In the one
I distribute judges and accused they figured.

167
00:30:46,939 --> 00:30:53,773
Dad was a young genius, he made for crucial NASA
designs in the American radar systems.

168
00:30:53,808 --> 00:30:58,742
That was our answer
for Russian SPUTNIK.

169
00:30:58,777 --> 00:31:09,304
Mom became consultant of campaigns her capacity
inventive he/she transformed into wealth and knowledge.

170
00:31:11,517 --> 00:31:15,448
But for the moment in that "the
company" reached the first million,

171
00:31:15,483 --> 00:31:21,543
the money seemed only
to increase their blindness.

172
00:31:24,300 --> 00:31:30,162
I remember the first family meeting, where
they counted us of their divorce plans.

173
00:31:31,094 --> 00:31:36,491
They wanted us to decide
with which wanted to live.

174
00:31:36,526 --> 00:31:40,879
And little time later... 

175
00:31:40,914 --> 00:31:43,869
 ... the divorce happened.

176
00:31:43,904 --> 00:31:47,830
The fights and those
meetings never finished.

177
00:31:47,865 --> 00:31:52,879
He/she took some time for
that Chris and I said:

178
00:31:52,914 --> 00:31:58,974
"It is necessary to continue ahead,
it is necessary to overcome"

179
00:31:59,009 --> 00:32:06,466
God, is firewood to prepare
I eat lunch and food once and for all.

180
00:32:06,501 --> 00:32:08,796
Where Jane left?

181
00:32:10,504 --> 00:32:17,338
My friend, everything is not well
in the life of the hippies.

182
00:32:25,879 --> 00:32:28,791
- Do you know that you are a little jodedor?
- Probably.

183
00:32:36,479 --> 00:32:41,060
It is amusing as they pass those
sew in certain moments.

184
00:32:42,886 --> 00:32:46,808
I have loved that woman for a lot of time.

185
00:32:49,355 --> 00:32:53,004
She has always been very reserved.

186
00:32:53,039 --> 00:32:59,814
We have been together...  in silence... 

187
00:32:59,849 --> 00:33:11,306
And when we picked up you yesterday, it was no longer
so silent, he/she wanted to speak of it.

188
00:33:11,341 --> 00:33:12,471
Do you know to that refer?

189
00:33:12,506 --> 00:33:18,102
- I believe that if.
- That it is what you believe.

190
00:33:18,137 --> 00:33:26,386
Good, some people feel
that they don't deserve to be loved.

191
00:33:26,421 --> 00:33:32,366
They walk quiet to
inclination of empty spaces.

192
00:33:32,401 --> 00:33:36,404
To close the breaches with the past.

193
00:33:36,439 --> 00:33:41,413
As much as feeling! God!

194
00:33:41,448 --> 00:33:43,471
Don't you like God or if?

195
00:33:43,506 --> 00:33:50,188
- He/she looks who speaks.
- You would not like to walk above the water and all that... 

196
00:33:50,223 --> 00:33:54,498
No, I have always feared to the water.

197
00:33:54,533 --> 00:33:59,094
Something that I will overcome in some moment.

198
00:33:59,129 --> 00:34:07,676
So I will swim and your
you take this to the camp.

199
00:34:07,711 --> 00:34:12,834
- Sure, he/she walks and you go.
- It is well.

200
00:34:46,795 --> 00:34:52,466
The seas only give a blow to the heart.

201
00:34:52,501 --> 00:34:57,083
And you have an opportunity
of feeling strong.

202
00:34:57,118 --> 00:35:05,706
Now, not you a lot about the sea, but
you that that it is the shape in that it is here.

203
00:35:05,741 --> 00:35:12,733
And also you that it is not in the life so
necessary to be strong, but feeling strong.

204
00:35:13,549 --> 00:35:19,801
To prove you at least once to yourself,
to be at least once yourself,

205
00:35:19,836 --> 00:35:23,878
in the oldest thing of
the human condition.

206
00:35:23,913 --> 00:35:33,042
Facing the fact of being alone, without anything
that he/she helps you, more than your hands and your head.

207
00:35:37,155 --> 00:35:38,724
Here I will reach you.

208
00:35:42,414 --> 00:35:45,170
Not I believe that you can.

209
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:23,773
 ... and maybe to give way to a basement, without more
possession that the enormous foundations of blocks.

210
00:36:23,808 --> 00:36:29,324
- Oh that say!
- You would like it, you would like if is still amid the road.

211
00:36:29,359 --> 00:36:36,235
-  ...  bothering the travelers.
- It sounds me well.

212
00:36:36,270 --> 00:36:39,846
If you come we will make you a space.

213
00:36:39,881 --> 00:36:43,380
I swear him to you.

214
00:37:46,304 --> 00:37:51,081
- I liked that boy.
- I know it.

215
00:38:00,654 --> 00:38:04,731
Chapter 2: Adolescence.

216
00:38:30,979 --> 00:38:41,113
You are very good. You are better than
any apple that has eaten up before.

217
00:38:42,354 --> 00:38:48,490
I Am Superman Supertramp,
and your you are Supermanzana.

218
00:38:48,994 --> 00:38:53,577
You are flavorful san. You are so organic.

219
00:38:53,612 --> 00:38:56,722
So natural.

220
00:38:56,757 --> 00:39:01,226
You are the apple of my life.

221
00:39:34,408 --> 00:39:41,046
At the beginning of September, they received a call
of the police, when the patrol car of highways

222
00:39:41,081 --> 00:39:46,560
he/she found Chris' abandoned car.

223
00:39:46,595 --> 00:39:50,405
A group of searchers
he/she rushed to the desert.

224
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:58,402
Not there were indications that Chris has returned
to the car, but neither there were indications of struggle.

225
00:39:59,141 --> 00:40:04,198
The police determined that
Chris had left to will.

226
00:40:08,198 --> 00:40:16,156
That didn't make happy my parents that quickly
they realized that what wanted

227
00:40:16,191 --> 00:40:21,648
Chris was really not to be opposing.

228
00:40:26,564 --> 00:40:30,019
Magic Bus
- Week 3

229
00:40:46,565 --> 00:40:48,426
21-alert of rice.

230
00:40:59,658 --> 00:41:08,935
Strong, you won't make anything, not
you will go anywhere. The money... 

231
00:41:08,970 --> 00:41:20,351
The power is an illusion. All this here
up. We can be here. Your and me.

232
00:41:36,306 --> 00:41:39,041
1, 2 ...  no, no, no.

233
00:41:46,229 --> 00:41:49,142
2 ... 

234
00:41:52,325 --> 00:41:54,421
3 ... 

235
00:42:47,348 --> 00:42:51,308
Dakota of the South to the This September
10, 1990. 19 months before... 

236
00:42:53,212 --> 00:42:57,599
It is this way like one makes,
you go right, right... 

237
00:42:58,919 --> 00:43:01,135
Wow this is íncreíble.

238
00:43:09,015 --> 00:43:12,122
- It feels super.
- Mantén the view to the front, won't leave, it grabs the helm well.

239
00:43:12,704 --> 00:43:15,967
That God blesses you, you
I will see in a while my friend.

240
00:43:22,411 --> 00:43:25,363
Hey makes it very well.

241
00:43:46,941 --> 00:43:52,106
- I made it to you again.
- Don't whore me more Wayne.

242
00:43:52,805 --> 00:43:56,882
- I don't know it for my that you/they were of the same side.
- I am tired of the same shit.

243
00:43:56,917 --> 00:44:04,852
They agreed,
they agreed.

244
00:44:05,901 --> 00:44:07,379
We go he/she leaves the man,
and leave me that the lame thing.

245
00:44:07,764 --> 00:44:12,620
- You go seriously with this.
- We go boys we continue with the game.

246
00:44:12,655 --> 00:44:15,182
- The good thing of this is to bet everything and that all go to hence.
- Do you want to play?

247
00:44:15,217 --> 00:44:17,357
No.

248
00:44:42,008 --> 00:44:47,090
- Do you need 20000 pounds?
- Those 20 thousand pounds need them clever.

249
00:45:08,863 --> 00:45:10,959
That you think of all this?

250
00:45:12,194 --> 00:45:14,213
I like all this.

251
00:45:31,374 --> 00:45:38,284
- Is there some place where he/she can acquire hunt books?
- Any thing that you want knows about hunt and preservation of species

252
00:45:38,319 --> 00:45:42,361
you should speak to it with
Kevin, that he/she is the man.

253
00:45:43,255 --> 00:45:46,633
Which is your fascination
for the bleakness?

254
00:45:46,668 --> 00:45:50,376
- I leave to Alaska.
- Alaska?

255
00:45:50,411 --> 00:45:55,617
There is a city in Alaska, I have buyers
there, and in that city there are markets.

256
00:45:55,652 --> 00:46:01,406
No, I refer to Alaska, the really.

257
00:46:01,441 --> 00:46:06,877
The whole route toward
up, all that me only.

258
00:46:06,912 --> 00:46:21,125
Without clock, neither you count, neither anything, alone to be there, there out,
the mountains, the river, the sky, to be there, in the wild thing.

259
00:46:21,160 --> 00:46:25,590
- In the wild thing... 
- If, in the wild thing.

260
00:46:25,625 --> 00:46:36,771
- That you will make when you are there? I would not know.
- Alone you live, you are in that place, you make it a special moment.

261
00:46:36,806 --> 00:46:41,237
- If.
- Perhaps to the return he/she can write a book of my trips.

262
00:46:41,272 --> 00:46:45,274
About being outside of
this sick society... 

263
00:46:45,309 --> 00:46:49,544
- The society.
- The society!

264
00:46:53,583 --> 00:47:03,988
Not I can understand, as each person
it can be so bad with the other one... 

265
00:47:04,023 --> 00:47:10,859
Not he/she has felt so much to judge,
to control, all those things... 

266
00:47:10,894 --> 00:47:15,557
- That people are speaking?
- You already know... 

267
00:47:15,592 --> 00:47:25,045
Parents, hypocrites,
political, cretin... 

268
00:47:25,080 --> 00:47:27,686
That is an error.

269
00:47:27,721 --> 00:47:34,106
It is an error to go so
deep with those things.

270
00:47:34,141 --> 00:47:39,619
You are a very young boy,
an impish young boy.

271
00:47:39,654 --> 00:47:47,113
But I can tell you, you are a youth,
that you have fire in the blood.

272
00:47:47,148 --> 00:47:49,496
And it is kind of a relief... 

273
00:47:49,531 --> 00:47:51,982
- Wayne, that they are speaking?
- That?

274
00:47:52,017 --> 00:47:55,437
We are speaking of blood and fire,
of as uniting the fire to the blood.

275
00:47:55,472 --> 00:47:57,587
Not I believe that you can
to give advice to anybody.

276
00:47:57,622 --> 00:47:59,800
- Do you believe that I am not able to?
- If.

277
00:47:59,835 --> 00:48:02,791
- I like in knowing it my name it is Sr. Happy.
- Sr. Happy.

278
00:48:02,826 --> 00:48:04,694
And Sr. Happy of time
in when he/she gives advice.

279
00:48:04,729 --> 00:48:06,984
- Alex, please.
- I sit down it.

280
00:48:07,019 --> 00:48:10,362
Sometimes Sr. Happy...  Because
it is always happy Sr. Happy?

281
00:48:10,397 --> 00:48:12,732
- Do you know because this happy one?
- It is not always happy.

282
00:48:12,767 --> 00:48:16,302
- Because it is happy?
- Can you tell me that? We go you tell it to me.

283
00:48:16,337 --> 00:48:19,565
I will tell you for that... 

284
00:48:22,089 --> 00:48:24,381
Sit down before you injure.

285
00:48:24,416 --> 00:48:32,844
A thing in which you should notice is always in
what passed in those episodes of Rosswell.

286
00:48:45,695 --> 00:48:50,586
When they made the revision of taxes it was known that
Chris' funds had donated them to the charity.

287
00:48:50,621 --> 00:48:57,240
My parents decided that it could not delay more.
They hired a private investigator, and they notified

288
00:48:57,275 --> 00:49:02,676
to the forces of the nation,
so that they stopped the search.

289
00:49:02,711 --> 00:49:08,422
I imagine to the beautiful gypsies
far from the eyes of the justice.

290
00:49:19,039 --> 00:49:26,763
Good I will give you the
basic that should know.

291
00:49:26,798 --> 00:49:29,754
Since you want to become
in a rebellious youth.

292
00:49:29,789 --> 00:49:35,733
Well, then when you have your prey, the time
it is everything, you have to make sure of conserving

293
00:49:35,768 --> 00:49:43,264
all that is meat. Alone you will have one hour
to clean it, but if the climate doesn't accompany

294
00:49:43,299 --> 00:49:45,984
you will have less time to make it.

295
00:49:53,824 --> 00:49:59,532
To leave the deer in rooms. To remove those
bowels, liver, kidneys, to remove the heart.

296
00:51:06,324 --> 00:51:09,431
Calm, calm.

297
00:51:13,119 --> 00:51:16,108
This is a rain of black boxes.

298
00:51:16,143 --> 00:51:19,487
Sr. Burke, Scott Baker, FBI,
I believe that he/she knows because we are here.

299
00:51:19,522 --> 00:51:24,503
They have taken of surprise. Him
would it bother to go up my zipper? Thank you.

300
00:51:25,934 --> 00:51:28,467
I sit down it small you go to
to be alone for a while.

301
00:51:29,277 --> 00:51:31,997
Alex can take my
I work when you want.

302
00:51:32,032 --> 00:51:35,141
MAntén everything in order not
I believe that it delays too much.

303
00:51:35,176 --> 00:51:41,539
Alex remembers, nobody can change the one
world, to the South, you have to go to the South.

304
00:52:05,021 --> 00:52:11,311
When Chris graduated of the high school
he/she had their first car. It managed for the whole country.

305
00:52:12,359 --> 00:52:14,921
It was outside almost the whole summer.

306
00:52:16,212 --> 00:52:18,308
The neighbors will be looking at you... 

307
00:52:24,368 --> 00:52:31,398
So soon I listened that there was
returned I ran to speak with him.

308
00:52:33,380 --> 00:52:36,651
In California he/she met with
some friends of the family.

309
00:52:37,663 --> 00:52:44,650
He/she discovered that the history of love and marriage
of our parents, it was calculated to hide

310
00:52:44,685 --> 00:52:52,336
a terrible truth. When they met each other, dad
it was already married. And before Chris was born

311
00:52:52,371 --> 00:52:56,724
dad already had another son,
of their first Marcia handcuffs.

312
00:52:56,759 --> 00:53:00,414
And they were still legally married.

313
00:53:01,501 --> 00:53:08,373
These facts redefined us
as bastard children.

314
00:53:11,285 --> 00:53:17,066
My father's arrogance didn't allow him/her
to accept the whole pain that had caused.

315
00:53:17,843 --> 00:53:25,879
And my mother in their shameful situation
of lover their accomplice was made.

316
00:53:30,422 --> 00:53:34,654
The fragility of the glass is not
a weakness but a resource.

317
00:53:35,354 --> 00:53:40,750
My parents understood that they should manage
the glass carefully or it would break.

318
00:53:40,785 --> 00:53:46,535
It passed this way my brother, they didn't seem
to know or to care him/her the damage that you/they had caused with

319
00:53:46,570 --> 00:53:48,479
their secret actions.

320
00:53:53,602 --> 00:54:00,048
Their old marriage, and the negation of my
father for his other son, was for Chris... 

321
00:54:00,083 --> 00:54:03,969
a murder of truths every day.

322
00:54:04,004 --> 00:54:09,908
He/she spent all their life giving turns, as a
I laugh that changes the address of their flow.

323
00:54:18,412 --> 00:54:22,993
This revelation made jag
in Chris' identity.

324
00:54:23,028 --> 00:54:28,041
It seemed him/her that its
childhood habá fiction.

325
00:54:29,360 --> 00:54:32,816
Chris never told them that he knew it.

326
00:54:34,175 --> 00:54:37,282
And he/she made me promise
that he/she would never tell them to him.

327
00:54:38,524 --> 00:54:42,329
Not I can pay for the 4,
who can pay for that reason?

328
00:54:43,940 --> 00:54:46,303
- Can I help him?
- If.

329
00:54:46,338 --> 00:54:51,507
If I want to navigate the river which
would the best place be to begin?

330
00:54:51,542 --> 00:54:55,443
To navigate? That level
of experience you do have?

331
00:54:55,478 --> 00:54:58,899
- Not a lot.
- Some? Are you beginner?

332
00:54:58,934 --> 00:55:01,733
Beginner?, Beginner so that?

333
00:55:01,768 --> 00:55:08,722
Not you can go I laugh below if you are beginner. If you want to go
for one year and to make you of experience puts you on the list.

334
00:55:11,478 --> 00:55:15,517
- Is there a list for that?
- If.

335
00:55:15,552 --> 00:55:19,749
Will all have to wait?

336
00:55:27,320 --> 00:55:32,174
The next one available
it is for May 17 of 2003.

337
00:55:37,219 --> 00:55:42,655
Twelve years? It can dry off the river.

338
00:55:45,141 --> 00:55:55,741
You could go in a commercial trip with
a guide, but 2000 dollars would cost you.

339
00:55:56,361 --> 00:55:58,978
Thank you.

340
00:56:36,190 --> 00:56:38,558
You are crazy small!

341
00:57:16,709 --> 00:57:19,745
I Am Supertramp!

342
00:57:32,214 --> 00:57:39,319
If we admit that the human life is governed by the
reason, the possibility of the life would be destroyed.

343
00:58:15,483 --> 00:58:17,851
They come, unite to us.

344
00:58:34,719 --> 00:58:36,117
- I Am Mess.
- Mess?

345
00:58:36,152 --> 00:58:39,184
- Mess.
- Alex.

346
00:58:39,219 --> 00:58:42,641
I Am Sonia.

347
00:58:42,676 --> 00:58:45,709
Hello Alex.

348
00:58:45,744 --> 00:58:47,999
Do you come up from river?

349
00:58:48,034 --> 00:58:51,262
And over there the rapids are.

350
00:58:51,297 --> 00:58:53,475
Because if.

351
00:58:53,510 --> 00:58:55,627
- He/she came navigating for the rapids.
- Don't I believe it?

352
00:58:55,662 --> 00:58:59,199
- As in the movies?
- In it ascends and it lowers. Be crazy!

353
00:58:59,234 --> 00:59:00,985
If, you made it, you are crazy.

354
00:59:01,020 --> 00:59:02,771
My God!

355
00:59:02,806 --> 00:59:05,100
Take away from my, take away from my.

356
00:59:05,135 --> 00:59:09,139
We go, jump of the boat.

357
00:59:09,886 --> 00:59:11,921
I love this. Don't you like it?

358
00:59:14,560 --> 00:59:17,318
This is nature.

359
00:59:25,549 --> 00:59:29,665
- Of where you are?
- Not I belong to any side.

360
00:59:30,868 --> 00:59:35,023
You will like then this,
it is good to know you.

361
00:59:35,645 --> 00:59:39,683
We went to THE and then to Las Vegas.

362
00:59:41,121 --> 00:59:45,002
He/she has a spirit that city!,
their universe is so good.

363
00:59:51,059 --> 00:59:54,050
- You know about what we speak.
- If.

364
00:59:55,447 --> 00:59:58,243
It is one of the best cities.

365
01:00:00,728 --> 01:00:03,136
I love their spirit.

366
01:00:05,167 --> 01:00:08,767
- Do you know you to arrive in Mexico through the river?
- If.

367
01:00:08,802 --> 01:00:20,453
If, you take the kayak and you navigate until that
place of there, and then all rectum to Mexico.

368
01:00:20,488 --> 01:00:22,666
- Seriously?
- If.

369
01:00:22,701 --> 01:00:26,474
Sonia, show him/her like it is.

370
01:00:26,509 --> 01:00:28,996
Give him/her, give him/her... 

371
01:00:29,031 --> 01:00:33,423
- It is sometimes so slow... 
- Here the map is.

372
01:00:33,458 --> 01:00:36,116
As I like you!

373
01:00:41,002 --> 01:00:48,342
- They will be 230 km, as 200 miles.
- 2 thousand miles?

374
01:00:50,827 --> 01:00:56,274
- That such if I go the whole route to Baja California?
- If, undoubtedly you can.

375
01:00:56,309 --> 01:01:03,456
I will go with you, we will exchange ourselves
in the kayak, we will arrive well in Mexico.

376
01:01:03,491 --> 01:01:09,009
Do you know? for that each man takes
in their heart a Mexican lover.

377
01:01:09,044 --> 01:01:16,438
- As you dare before my?
- I will change you for a Mexican lover.

378
01:01:26,488 --> 01:01:29,750
I have to leave boys,
I sit down it, I have to leave.

379
01:01:31,227 --> 01:01:41,282
There the patrol car of the river comes and they cannot see me,
because I don't have permission and it should not be here.

380
01:01:41,317 --> 01:01:49,091
If they ask them, you. they don't have me
seen, seriously I sit down it a lot.

381
01:01:49,126 --> 01:01:53,785
Good luck, pleasure in
to know you. Good-bye Alex.

382
01:01:53,820 --> 01:01:59,832
Good-bye, greets Mexico for my.

383
01:01:59,867 --> 01:02:03,239
Good-bye Alex.

384
01:02:33,949 --> 01:02:39,963
It will be navidad in a couple of months, and the last
news that we had were when they found their car.

385
01:02:39,998 --> 01:02:49,010
Me dseperté some days ago and I felt that they were not alone my
parents those that were annoying for you don't know about Chris.

386
01:02:49,045 --> 01:02:52,503
Affection, I am me.

387
01:02:52,538 --> 01:02:56,657
I sit down it, things have happened.

388
01:02:56,692 --> 01:03:00,230
Give me another opportunity.

389
01:03:00,968 --> 01:03:05,782
Please, make it for my.

390
01:03:06,985 --> 01:03:12,810
Right now I don't have more
currencies, could you hurry?

391
01:03:13,323 --> 01:03:16,352
We go, don't hang me.

392
01:03:16,387 --> 01:03:20,777
- Here he/she has a currency.
- Thank you.

393
01:03:20,812 --> 01:03:29,551
A fallen currency has appeared of the one
sky. So here I am again.

394
01:03:29,586 --> 01:03:35,802
I already put the currency...  no, no, not.

395
01:03:35,837 --> 01:03:42,053
Not you because it was not about calling
in case I responded.

396
01:03:42,088 --> 01:03:45,857
He/she knew that it would not hang if I came out.

397
01:03:45,892 --> 01:03:49,353
For that don't send myself one
letter through a friend?

398
01:03:53,197 --> 01:03:57,198
But he/she told me to my same one that was good.

399
01:03:57,896 --> 01:04:03,301
He/she knew that he/she loved him too much
and that he/she would support not knowing.

400
01:04:04,032 --> 01:04:11,873
And that made me remember that there was
more than the anger, behind everything.

401
01:04:17,697 --> 01:04:22,977
Chris was always rash,
lover of the adventure.

402
01:04:35,711 --> 01:04:42,970
When he/she was 4 years old, he/she left to 6 blocks
of the house at three in the morning.

403
01:04:49,492 --> 01:04:55,860
They found it in the kitchen of a neighbor
on a seat, eating up some candies.

404
01:04:57,655 --> 01:05:04,759
Any thing that this
making should be something very sweet.

405
01:05:32,601 --> 01:05:34,728
Wayne

406
01:05:40,722 --> 01:05:47,591
I hate to have to imagine to a
type salvage like your in a cage.

407
01:05:49,343 --> 01:05:57,374
To walk is this way very easy with
all the money that you paid me.

408
01:06:00,521 --> 01:06:08,169
My days were more exitantes
when he/she didn't have a cent.

409
01:06:17,801 --> 01:06:23,233
I have decided that I go to vicir this
life for a long time to come.

410
01:06:25,719 --> 01:06:32,009
The freedom and the beauty of the simple thing
it is too good to allow it to happen.

411
01:06:39,967 --> 01:06:44,170
Sea of Cortez. December 2 of 1990.

412
01:07:00,633 --> 01:07:04,355
- Did you live in a cave for 26 days?
- If Sr.

413
01:07:04,390 --> 01:07:09,830
- As he/she went that you entered to Mexico?
- For the road of the river.

414
01:07:09,865 --> 01:07:12,858
- Does the river dry off quickly after that certain point?
- Sip.

415
01:07:12,893 --> 01:07:21,400
I arrived for a north connection of the river.
I pushed my kayak for the whole desert.

416
01:07:22,088 --> 01:07:24,372
But after a storm
my kayak was buried.
