00:13:53,465 --> 00:13:54,433
Sign right here, dear.

189
00:14:04,376 --> 00:14:08,047
Now, you just give this a squeeze every 10 seconds or so,

190
00:14:08,147 --> 00:14:09,315
and nature will do the rest.

191
00:14:12,518 --> 00:14:13,352
Be good.

192
00:14:17,856 --> 00:14:18,691
MAN OFFICER: Partner?

193
00:14:18,791 --> 00:14:20,259
Yeah?

194
00:14:20,359 --> 00:14:22,661
MAN OFFICER: You catch Mueller on the tube the other night?

195
00:14:22,761 --> 00:14:30,002
As in-- out of Fresno Mueller?

196
00:14:30,102 --> 00:14:33,405
[inaudible] He was on Cops.

197
00:14:33,505 --> 00:14:35,207
No shit.

198
00:14:35,307 --> 00:14:36,909
How'd that creep get on TV?

199
00:14:37,009 --> 00:14:38,711
MAN OFFICER: He was busting these crack guys, right?

200
00:14:38,811 --> 00:14:41,213
Mueller's on-point, of course.

201
00:14:41,313 --> 00:14:43,649
He's got all the videos and lights trained right

202
00:14:43,749 --> 00:14:45,217
on this [inaudible]. - Right.

203
00:14:45,317 --> 00:14:48,454
When the boy goes to raise his foot to kick in the door,

204
00:14:48,554 --> 00:14:53,025
his pants split right down the back, bam.

205
00:14:53,125 --> 00:14:55,094
And you know what he's wearing under there?

206
00:14:55,194 --> 00:14:56,128
WOMAN OFFICER: You're serious?

207
00:14:56,228 --> 00:14:57,429
MAN OFFICER: Yes, I'm serious.

208
00:14:57,529 --> 00:15:01,533
He's got on some red lace bikini underwear.

209
00:15:05,604 --> 00:15:08,474
[sobbing]

210
00:15:26,925 --> 00:15:28,494
Wasn't so bad, was it?

211
00:15:31,730 --> 00:15:32,531
All done.

212
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:43,309
Oh no, you don't.

213
00:15:43,409 --> 00:15:46,879
You have to sit down for a few minutes before you can go.

214
00:15:46,979 --> 00:15:49,381
Over there, please.

215
00:15:49,481 --> 00:15:50,316
Three words.

216
00:15:53,452 --> 00:15:55,821
Mr. and Mrs. Mueller raised a freak, I guess.

217
00:15:55,921 --> 00:15:56,922
WOMAN OFFICER: Oh, his mother.

218
00:15:57,022 --> 00:15:57,823
Yeah.

219
00:15:57,923 --> 00:15:59,858
He has a cute wife.

220
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:01,794
He claims that their his wife's, right?

221
00:16:01,894 --> 00:16:05,331
That he grabbed a late shift, pulled him on in the dark,

222
00:16:05,431 --> 00:16:06,632
didn't know.

223
00:16:06,732 --> 00:16:09,068
Tell me I don't have to act like I believe that.

224
00:16:13,505 --> 00:16:15,174
Thank you.

225
00:16:15,274 --> 00:16:19,244
That's the serve part of to protect and serve.

226
00:16:19,345 --> 00:16:21,113
[inaudible], partner.

227
00:16:21,213 --> 00:16:23,582
Take care of yourself.

228
00:16:23,682 --> 00:16:25,751
You know what the best part about giving blood is?

229
00:16:25,851 --> 00:16:26,685
What?

230
00:16:26,785 --> 00:16:29,555
Beer goes twice as far.

231
00:16:29,655 --> 00:16:31,123
[inaudible]

232
00:16:34,593 --> 00:16:36,261
OK, fellas, here we go.

233
00:16:36,362 --> 00:16:38,764
Oh, it's beautiful honey, thank you.

234
00:16:38,864 --> 00:16:41,633
- Sorry it took so long. - It looks just beautiful.

235
00:16:41,734 --> 00:16:43,702
Gosh, perfect.

236
00:16:43,802 --> 00:16:46,638
Birthday bird for Josh.

237
00:16:46,739 --> 00:16:48,207
Why don't you do this, Josh?

238
00:16:56,081 --> 00:16:58,984
OK, forget the lazy karaoke machine.

239
00:16:59,084 --> 00:16:59,985
You ready?

240
00:17:00,085 --> 00:17:02,354
Cryogenics.

241
00:17:02,454 --> 00:17:03,822
I can't afford a whole body.

242
00:17:03,922 --> 00:17:06,325
But I could foot the bill to have your heads frozen.

243
00:17:06,425 --> 00:17:08,394
You know, after you go beyond.

244
00:17:08,494 --> 00:17:09,995
They say all you need is the head,

245
00:17:10,095 --> 00:17:13,132
and they'll get you a new body later.

246
00:17:13,232 --> 00:17:14,900
What do you say?

247
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:18,303
I'll take a wing, Josh.

248
00:17:18,404 --> 00:17:20,272
Would you come in here a minute?

249
00:17:24,143 --> 00:17:25,744
What's in here is for you, Josh.

250
00:17:34,286 --> 00:17:38,757
You were nearly two years old when your parents died.

251
00:17:38,857 --> 00:17:42,795
I must say, we have felt blessed to have you in our house

252
00:17:42,895 --> 00:17:44,797
these years.

253
00:17:44,897 --> 00:17:48,834
You are our son, Josh.

254
00:17:48,934 --> 00:17:50,235
I think you know that.

255
00:17:50,335 --> 00:17:53,138
It hasn't always been easy.

256
00:17:53,238 --> 00:17:54,840
You've had a tough time.

257
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:55,808
I know it's still tough.

258
00:17:58,577 --> 00:18:01,346
I see the trouble in you, Josh.

259
00:18:01,447 --> 00:18:03,816
But I look beyond that, and I see a fine man.

260
00:18:07,653 --> 00:18:11,657
These are the adoption papers making you our son.

261
00:18:11,757 --> 00:18:14,693
Somewhere in there its says that we are responsible for you

262
00:18:14,793 --> 00:18:17,062
until you're 18.

263
00:18:17,162 --> 00:18:18,197
You are free.

264
00:18:30,742 --> 00:18:31,543
It's for you.

265
00:18:34,713 --> 00:18:36,682
What's this, Josh?

266
00:18:36,782 --> 00:18:37,616
It's from the college.

267
00:18:44,223 --> 00:18:48,093
Oh, that's-- that's wonderful, Josh.

268
00:18:48,193 --> 00:18:50,796
This is-- honey, look at this.

269
00:18:50,896 --> 00:18:52,598
Look at this.

270
00:18:52,698 --> 00:18:53,832
Look at this.

271
00:18:53,932 --> 00:18:55,734
What is it?

272
00:18:55,834 --> 00:19:00,239
[gasps] Oh, oh, thank God.

273
00:19:00,339 --> 00:19:01,473
Oh, thank God. Oh.

274
00:19:01,573 --> 00:19:02,774
Josh.

275
00:19:02,875 --> 00:19:05,944
Oh, I'm so happy for you, honey.

276
00:19:06,044 --> 00:19:07,713
Stop spinning.

277
00:19:07,813 --> 00:19:10,015
I knew you'd make the right choice.

278
00:19:10,115 --> 00:19:11,316
Stop spinning him.

279
00:19:11,416 --> 00:19:12,818
This calls for real celebration.

280
00:19:12,918 --> 00:19:14,887
Let's go over to the Red Baron and have them open

281
00:19:14,987 --> 00:19:16,188
up a bottle of champagne, huh?

282
00:19:16,288 --> 00:19:17,789
Oh, yes.

283
00:19:17,890 --> 00:19:19,258
Oh.

284
00:19:19,358 --> 00:19:21,627
Oh, sweetheart.

285
00:19:21,727 --> 00:19:22,561
I'm so happy.

286
00:19:22,661 --> 00:19:23,462
Yes.

287
00:19:33,772 --> 00:19:36,875
Oh, dear God.

288
00:19:36,975 --> 00:19:38,477
Josh, it's your brother.

289
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:42,814
Happy birthday, Josh.

290
00:19:53,358 --> 00:19:55,093
I cannot believe he was adopted.

291
00:19:55,194 --> 00:19:56,595
Let alone, a brother.

292
00:19:56,695 --> 00:19:59,097
Yeah, well all this went down way before you moved in.

293
00:19:59,197 --> 00:20:02,100
Josh was only two when it happened.

294
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:04,002
Walter was 12.

295
00:20:04,102 --> 00:20:05,971
Parents died in a car wreck.

296
00:20:06,071 --> 00:20:07,172
Fuck.

297
00:20:07,272 --> 00:20:08,540
He was in the car when it happened.

298
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:10,876
And his brother was at a friend's place.

299
00:20:10,976 --> 00:20:12,144
No shit?

300
00:20:12,244 --> 00:20:14,546
Yeah, so the Minnell's adopted them

301
00:20:14,646 --> 00:20:18,917
both And 10 years ago, a day after his 18th birthday,

302
00:20:19,017 --> 00:20:20,352
Walter just split.

303
00:20:22,955 --> 00:20:24,456
Hey, Josh, man.

304
00:20:24,556 --> 00:20:25,591
You want some of this?

305
00:20:29,394 --> 00:20:32,331
How's it going, baby?

306
00:20:32,431 --> 00:20:34,066
Top of the world, ma.

307
00:20:34,166 --> 00:20:35,601
That good, huh?

308
00:20:35,701 --> 00:20:39,104
This [inaudible] powder is 100% guaranteed, man.

309
00:20:39,204 --> 00:20:40,906
Let's do it.

310
00:20:41,006 --> 00:20:43,008
Who's got the straw?

311
00:20:43,108 --> 00:20:44,843
Well, I don't have it.

312
00:20:44,943 --> 00:20:46,044
Nobody's got a straw?

313
00:20:46,144 --> 00:20:46,979
Wait a second.

314
00:20:47,079 --> 00:20:48,180
Anybody have a belt?

315
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:49,881
We've got to have something.

316
00:20:49,982 --> 00:20:51,416
I've got s dime.

317
00:20:51,516 --> 00:20:53,552
That is not helping us here, Ike.

318
00:20:53,652 --> 00:20:55,153
Why don't you go look and see if you can find

319
00:20:55,254 --> 00:20:57,489
a piece of paper or something.

320
00:20:57,589 --> 00:20:59,958
Get down to business here.

321
00:21:00,058 --> 00:21:00,993
I've got something.

322
00:21:04,062 --> 00:21:07,099
Yo, Walter.

323
00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:08,367
Bella.

324
00:21:08,467 --> 00:21:10,168
You went to school with my brother, Eddie.

325
00:21:10,268 --> 00:21:11,670
Eddie Soto?

326
00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:12,371
Yeah.

327
00:21:12,471 --> 00:21:13,605
You're little Bella?

328
00:21:13,705 --> 00:21:15,841
Yeah.

329
00:21:15,941 --> 00:21:17,309
How's Eddie doing?

330
00:21:17,409 --> 00:21:21,279
He killed himself, man.

331
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:23,515
Nah, I'm just fucking with ya.

332
00:21:27,285 --> 00:21:28,720
Do you want some of this?

333
00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:30,055
No, no, thanks.

334
00:21:30,155 --> 00:21:31,223
It's all for you.

335
00:21:31,323 --> 00:21:33,158
Eddie said you were a real partier.

336
00:21:33,258 --> 00:21:34,660
Eddie said that, did he?

337
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:36,628
Yeah.

338
00:21:36,728 --> 00:21:40,565
Well, I guess I used to be a real partier.

339
00:21:40,666 --> 00:21:42,567
How'd you know we'd be down here?

340
00:21:42,668 --> 00:21:43,368
Your?

341
00:21:43,468 --> 00:21:46,138
Mom says you hang out here.

342
00:21:46,238 --> 00:21:48,240
My mom?

343
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:51,877
My mom's dead, Josh.

344
00:21:51,977 --> 00:21:53,211
Come on.

345
00:21:53,312 --> 00:21:58,050
SIMON: Hey man, be careful with that stuff.

346
00:21:58,150 --> 00:21:59,818
Are you angry with me?

347
00:21:59,918 --> 00:22:01,353
I used to have parents.

348
00:22:01,453 --> 00:22:03,121
They died.

349
00:22:03,221 --> 00:22:05,290
I got new ones.

350
00:22:05,390 --> 00:22:06,425
I used to have a brother.

351
00:22:09,561 --> 00:22:11,563
Hey Josh, you still get that dream?

352
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:17,669
I'm going to spend a couple of nights over at the Holiday Inn.

353
00:22:39,024 --> 00:22:43,295
[knocking on door]

354
00:22:43,395 --> 00:22:44,329
Come on in.

355
00:22:44,429 --> 00:22:45,464
Want a sandwich?

356
00:22:48,333 --> 00:22:52,170
I just came to give this back to you.

357
00:22:52,270 --> 00:22:54,106
Well, that's all right, Josh.

358
00:22:54,206 --> 00:22:55,107
Keep it.

359
00:22:55,207 --> 00:22:56,408
It's a birthday present.

360
00:22:56,508 --> 00:22:59,211
I don't want it.

361
00:22:59,311 --> 00:23:02,781
Well, why did you come up here, Josh?

362
00:23:02,881 --> 00:23:04,316
You could have left that at the front desk.

363
00:23:04,416 --> 00:23:05,917
You could have stuck it in the mail.

364
00:23:06,017 --> 00:23:08,720
What was it you wanted to see here, Josh?

365
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:11,089
Why did you ask me about that dream?

366
00:23:11,189 --> 00:23:13,125
What difference does it make?

367
00:23:13,225 --> 00:23:16,328
You don't get it anymore, right?

368
00:23:16,428 --> 00:23:18,597
I'm out of here.

369
00:23:18,697 --> 00:23:22,200
[engine not turning over]

370
00:23:37,649 --> 00:23:38,817
You're flooding it.

371
00:23:43,388 --> 00:23:44,222
Fuck.

372
00:23:48,693 --> 00:23:49,728
Where are you going?

373
00:23:49,828 --> 00:23:51,630
I'm going to call a tow truck.

374
00:23:51,730 --> 00:23:53,732
Why don't you just let it sit there?

375
00:23:53,832 --> 00:23:57,335
We'll come back and jump start it later.

376
00:23:57,436 --> 00:23:59,070
Come on, college boy.

377
00:23:59,171 --> 00:24:00,305
Do the smart thing.

378
00:24:00,405 --> 00:24:02,841
Get in.

379
00:24:02,941 --> 00:24:04,309
Come on, I'll give you a lift home.

380
00:24:04,409 --> 00:24:06,178
We'll come back and jump start it later.

381
00:24:06,278 --> 00:24:07,245
I got to covered, Walter.

382
00:24:07,345 --> 00:24:08,413
You've got it covered?

383
00:24:08,513 --> 00:24:10,515
It is 1,000 degrees out here, Josh.

384
00:24:10,615 --> 00:24:12,551
You're going to have to pay some schmuck $75

385
00:24:12,651 --> 00:24:14,553
to jump start your car, and you've got it covered?

386
00:24:16,988 --> 00:24:17,789
You have $75?

387
00:24:21,526 --> 00:24:23,995
Left that $100 up in my hotel room.

388
00:24:24,095 --> 00:24:25,397
[music playing]

389
00:24:25,497 --> 00:24:28,800
Harm from shock.

390
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:36,975
Reaching around, put your hand to the clock.

391
00:24:37,075 --> 00:24:42,948
Should I [inaudible]

392
00:24:43,048 --> 00:24:45,550
No one, I mean no one, makes a better air

393
00:24:45,650 --> 00:24:47,219
conditioner than the hard-working men

394
00:24:47,319 --> 00:24:48,787
and women of the US of A, Josh.

395
00:24:52,257 --> 00:24:53,725
[inaudible] me?

396
00:24:59,164 --> 00:25:02,067
This isn't the way home.

397
00:25:02,167 --> 00:25:04,169
I know.

398
00:25:04,269 --> 00:25:06,104
I have to do a little business.

399
00:25:06,204 --> 00:25:08,573
Just take a few minutes, then I'll drop you off.

400
00:25:08,673 --> 00:25:09,908
Business?

401
00:25:10,008 --> 00:25:13,111
Yeah, you might find it interesting.

402
00:25:13,211 --> 00:25:14,179
I don't think so.

403
00:25:17,849 --> 00:25:20,852
I have to be somewhere.

404
00:25:20,952 --> 00:25:21,920
Where?

405
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:24,456
You have to meet those friends of yours?

406
00:25:24,556 --> 00:25:27,192
They seem like a real supportive little crew.

407
00:25:27,292 --> 00:25:29,394
What the fuck would you know about support?

408
00:25:29,494 --> 00:25:30,829
Relax.

409
00:25:30,929 --> 00:25:33,398
I have to meet this guy, Josh. Look at some papers.

410
00:25:33,498 --> 00:25:35,467
It's only going to take a few minutes.

411
00:25:35,567 --> 00:25:36,902
Then I'll take you home.

412
00:25:53,485 --> 00:25:55,687
Two icy cold Cokes, extra sugary,

413
00:25:55,787 --> 00:25:57,622
mixed with all the freon in here.

414
00:25:57,722 --> 00:25:58,757
You'll be fine.

415
00:26:07,332 --> 00:26:08,566
You know, Josh.

416
00:26:08,667 --> 00:26:10,302
One day freon is going to be against the law.

417
00:26:27,752 --> 00:26:28,787
[music playing]

418
00:26:28,887 --> 00:26:32,958
(SINGING) Come to the parking lot.

419
00:26:33,058 --> 00:26:39,698
I was born the son of man who [inaudible] for the day.

420
00:26:43,401 --> 00:26:52,844
Look at the [inaudible] seems he couldn't leave it alone.

421
00:26:52,944 --> 00:26:55,013
[inaudible] all the day.

422
00:26:58,850 --> 00:27:03,221
Still I sleep like him.

423
00:27:03,321 --> 00:27:05,290
Still I--

424
00:27:05,390 --> 00:27:07,225
Uh-oh, lookie here, boy.

425
00:27:07,325 --> 00:27:09,761
Come here.

426
00:27:09,861 --> 00:27:15,734
Well, well, well, how you doing?

427
00:27:15,834 --> 00:27:17,469
OK, how about you?

428
00:27:17,569 --> 00:27:18,403
We're all right.

429
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:23,308
I'll be seeing you.

430
00:27:23,408 --> 00:27:24,976
Hey, is this a hippie?

431
00:27:25,076 --> 00:27:25,910
Right?

432
00:27:26,011 --> 00:27:30,448
I thought we was done with hippie?

433
00:27:30,548 --> 00:27:31,383
Come on, fellas.

434
00:27:31,483 --> 00:27:32,617
Oh, this isn't hippie.

435
00:27:32,717 --> 00:27:37,322
This is that grunge look from Seattle.

436
00:27:37,422 --> 00:27:40,291
You from Seattle?

437
00:27:40,392 --> 00:27:43,161
No, I hail from Carthage.

438
00:27:43,261 --> 00:27:45,897
I'm traveling to Jerusalem to see the infant King

439
00:27:45,997 --> 00:27:48,033
I'm following the star.

440
00:27:48,133 --> 00:27:50,168
Look, it shines above us even now.

441
00:28:03,048 --> 00:28:04,582
Mint?

442
00:28:04,682 --> 00:28:06,818
Mint?

443
00:28:06,918 --> 00:28:09,087
Jesus, guys, you don't want to do this.

444
00:28:09,187 --> 00:28:09,954
Hold him.

445
00:28:10,055 --> 00:28:13,391
Let's just hold it right there.

446
00:28:13,491 --> 00:28:14,926
That's right.

447
00:28:15,026 --> 00:28:17,295
Let's all take it nice and easy.

448
00:28:17,395 --> 00:28:20,265
Detective Walter Schmeiss, County Sheriff's Department.

449
00:28:20,365 --> 00:28:21,166
What?

450
00:28:21,266 --> 00:28:22,100
Is it play time?

451
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:24,803
Nobody told me.

452
00:28:24,903 --> 00:28:26,071
You say something?

453
00:28:32,744 --> 00:28:37,048
Why don't we take a walk over to me car and talk about this?

454
00:28:37,148 --> 00:28:39,818
Hey, detective, let's see a badge.

455
00:28:39,918 --> 00:28:40,985
This is police business now.

456
00:28:41,086 --> 00:28:42,120
You boys don't want to get involved.

457
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:43,721
You don't badge us, you're no cop.

458
00:28:43,822 --> 00:28:45,824
I said this is police business.

459
00:28:45,924 --> 00:28:47,192
You don't want to get involved.

460
00:28:47,292 --> 00:28:50,028
You ain't no cop.

461
00:28:50,128 --> 00:28:52,030
If it will make you happy, I'll show you my badge.

462
00:28:54,866 --> 00:28:55,934
Run, Josh.

463
00:28:56,034 --> 00:28:56,868
Run.

464
00:29:08,413 --> 00:29:09,247
Yeah, you drive.

465
00:29:12,851 --> 00:29:15,653
County Sheriff's department?

466
00:29:15,754 --> 00:29:17,222
This is police business?

467
00:29:17,322 --> 00:29:18,723
You boys don't want to get involved.

468
00:29:18,823 --> 00:29:20,792
You boys?

469
00:29:20,892 --> 00:29:26,998
That name, Schmeiss, Detective Walter Schmeiss.

470
00:29:27,098 --> 00:29:28,133
Detective Schmeiss?

471
00:29:32,704 --> 00:29:34,539
What?

472
00:29:34,639 --> 00:29:39,811
Schmeiss is my name, Walter Schmeiss.

473
00:29:39,911 --> 00:29:43,915
After I left, I changed my name back.

474
00:29:44,015 --> 00:29:46,484
It was our parents' name, Josh.

475
00:29:46,584 --> 00:29:47,418
It was your name.

476
00:29:51,789 --> 00:29:53,758
Say it, what do you feel?

477
00:29:53,858 --> 00:29:55,827
Nothing.

478
00:29:55,927 --> 00:29:57,695
Yeah, you feel nothing.

479
00:29:57,795 --> 00:29:59,130
That's not what I meant, Walter.

480
00:30:01,933 --> 00:30:04,869
Hey Josh, you still get those bad dreams?

481
00:30:04,969 --> 00:30:07,672
Not anymore.

482
00:30:07,772 --> 00:30:10,308
You used to scare the shit out of me.

483
00:30:10,408 --> 00:30:14,445
Middle of the night, you moving around like you were awake,

484
00:30:14,546 --> 00:30:17,382
screaming like a fucking monkey.

485
00:30:17,482 --> 00:30:18,283
They're gone.

486
00:30:21,085 --> 00:30:22,520
I'm glad to hear that, Josh.

487
00:30:28,626 --> 00:30:34,132
Say Josh, you sleeping with that girl, Bella?

488
00:30:34,232 --> 00:30:36,234
Sleeping?

489
00:30:36,334 --> 00:30:38,670
Women are a big thing, Josh.

490
00:30:38,770 --> 00:30:42,841
You can't just go sticking your little toe in the water.

491
00:30:42,941 --> 00:30:46,010
That's a beautiful image, Walter.

492
00:30:46,110 --> 00:30:50,215
So tell me, what exactly is it that you do, Walter?

493
00:30:50,315 --> 00:30:52,417
It's a transfer and storage business.

494
00:31:04,729 --> 00:31:05,964
Look at him back from the dead.

495
00:31:06,064 --> 00:31:07,699
Hey, Walter.

496
00:31:07,799 --> 00:31:09,000
How you doing?

497
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:10,935
It's good to see you, man.

498
00:31:11,035 --> 00:31:13,171
You must be Josh.

499
00:31:13,271 --> 00:31:13,905
Must be.

500
00:31:14,005 --> 00:31:15,406
Felice A Beato.

501
00:31:15,506 --> 00:31:17,408
He looks like you used to before you got old and fat.

502
00:31:20,011 --> 00:31:23,982
Gentlemen, come on in.

503
00:31:24,082 --> 00:31:24,882
Where's the old lady?

504
00:31:24,983 --> 00:31:26,884
Oh, she's out back.

505
00:31:26,985 --> 00:31:28,419
Walter, I got to show you something.

506
00:31:28,519 --> 00:31:30,221
Josh, I've got to talk to your brother for just a minute.

507
00:31:30,321 --> 00:31:32,290
So please, make yourself at home.

508
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:38,229
(WHISPERING) This is what I was talking about.

509
00:31:38,329 --> 00:31:39,397
See this?

510
00:31:39,497 --> 00:31:43,968
he flies in, and then he'll meet us here.

511
00:31:44,068 --> 00:31:45,937
WALTER: You have one of these?

512
00:31:46,037 --> 00:31:47,538
FELICE A BEATO: Yeah, I got your back.

513
00:31:50,608 --> 00:31:51,743
Hey, come on.

514
00:31:51,843 --> 00:31:53,945
Hoof around with me a little bit, huh?

515
00:31:54,045 --> 00:31:55,213
He's going to be a little while.

516
00:31:55,313 --> 00:31:56,514
And meanwhile, we're just getting fatter.

517
00:31:56,614 --> 00:31:57,415
Grab the bag.

518
00:31:57,515 --> 00:31:58,750
Hold the bag for me.

519
00:31:58,850 --> 00:31:59,918
Come on, just hold on to the bag.

520
00:32:00,018 --> 00:32:02,620
Don't we need gloves or something?

521
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:04,589
Why?

522
00:32:04,689 --> 00:32:09,394
So Walter told me that you had some trouble over at a rest

523
00:32:09,494 --> 00:32:12,463
stop, is that true?

524
00:32:12,563 --> 00:32:13,598
Just some assholes.

525
00:32:13,698 --> 00:32:16,401
Yeah?

526
00:32:16,501 --> 00:32:17,669
Come here.

527
00:32:17,769 --> 00:32:19,003
Jump into the ring with me.

528
00:32:19,103 --> 00:32:20,471
Come on, come on.

529
00:32:20,571 --> 00:32:22,473
Just move around a little to get the blood flowing.

530
00:32:22,573 --> 00:32:25,009
Yeah, I showed Walter a few things.

531
00:32:25,109 --> 00:32:27,211
Did he do all right? - Yeah, I guess so.

532
00:32:27,312 --> 00:32:28,880
Put your hands up. Guard up.

533
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:30,114
Stand kind of sideways.

534
00:32:30,214 --> 00:32:31,382
Don't make yourself such a big target.

535
00:32:31,482 --> 00:32:32,317
There you go.

536
00:32:32,417 --> 00:32:33,785
That's how you do it. Thumbs in.

537
00:32:33,885 --> 00:32:34,819
Hey, pay attention.

538
00:32:34,919 --> 00:32:37,055
Come on, focus, focus.

539
00:32:37,155 --> 00:32:38,990
Let me ask you something.

540
00:32:39,090 --> 00:32:41,092
This rest stop, what did it look like?

541
00:32:41,192 --> 00:32:44,062
Birds, trees, and grass, I guess.

542
00:32:44,162 --> 00:32:46,197
You guess?

543
00:32:46,297 --> 00:32:50,535
First rule, environmental awareness, OK?

544
00:32:50,635 --> 00:32:52,103
You've got to be accountable for everything

545
00:32:52,203 --> 00:32:57,342
in, on, and around you.

546
00:32:57,442 --> 00:33:00,912
When I walk into a room I look around, OK?

547
00:33:01,012 --> 00:33:02,480
I notice the objects.

548
00:33:02,580 --> 00:33:05,516
Try to sit with my arm close to something small and heavy.

549
00:33:05,616 --> 00:33:07,485
Something happens, you go ballistic.

550
00:33:07,585 --> 00:33:11,656
You invade their space and make it your own.

551
00:33:11,756 --> 00:33:13,591
[grunting]

552
00:33:13,691 --> 00:33:15,026
Coffee cup.

553
00:33:15,126 --> 00:33:19,464
The bridge of the nose makes a hell of an impression.

554
00:33:24,902 --> 00:33:27,505
[inaudible]

555
00:33:27,605 --> 00:33:29,273
Ow, fuck.

556
00:33:29,374 --> 00:33:31,042
I always work out with a cup on.

557
00:33:38,983 --> 00:33:40,952
Yeah, I heard he was on the pipe.

558
00:33:41,052 --> 00:33:41,986
Crack.

559
00:33:42,086 --> 00:33:44,188
Yeah, but they busted his ass.

560
00:33:44,288 --> 00:33:45,690
Cop breaks down his door, right?

561
00:33:45,790 --> 00:33:48,226
Policeman runs in, and the policeman splits his pants.

562
00:33:48,326 --> 00:33:49,994
They caught it all on that show, Cops.

563
00:33:50,094 --> 00:33:52,296
Cops?

564
00:33:52,397 --> 00:33:53,398
On TV.

565
00:33:53,498 --> 00:33:55,066
All right, I'll meet you at the airport.

566
00:33:55,166 --> 00:33:56,234
Right, right.

567
00:34:03,107 --> 00:34:05,410
WALTER: Here they are right here.

568
00:34:05,510 --> 00:34:07,779
One's David and the other one is Steven.

569
00:34:07,879 --> 00:34:08,980
MOTHER: Oh, they're so precious.

570
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:10,081
WALTER: You know, sometimes they're

571
00:34:10,181 --> 00:34:12,717
like a couple little animals.

572
00:34:12,817 --> 00:34:14,685
I don't know how I feel about being a grandfather.

573
00:34:14,786 --> 00:34:17,054
I have to be somewhere.

574
00:34:17,155 --> 00:34:18,523
Josh?

575
00:34:18,623 --> 00:34:23,094
You should bring them with you.

576
00:34:23,194 --> 00:34:27,265
[loud music]

577
00:34:34,105 --> 00:34:38,576
[inaudible]

578
00:34:52,557 --> 00:34:54,459
Diet root beer?

579
00:34:54,559 --> 00:34:56,427
Starting slow.

580
00:34:56,527 --> 00:34:58,496
I guess.

581
00:34:58,596 --> 00:34:59,397
You seen Bella?

582
00:35:27,525 --> 00:35:30,695
Hey, Josh, you want a hit?

583
00:35:30,795 --> 00:35:31,596
No thanks.

584
00:35:46,611 --> 00:35:48,913
Excuse me.

585
00:35:49,013 --> 00:35:51,849
Hey, Simon.

586
00:35:51,949 --> 00:35:54,552
Have you seen Bella?

587
00:35:54,652 --> 00:35:55,453
No.

588
00:36:00,725 --> 00:36:01,559
You all right?

589
00:36:04,228 --> 00:36:06,364
Yeah, man.

590
00:36:06,464 --> 00:36:10,167
I just think I need to sit down for a minute, you know?

591
00:36:10,268 --> 00:36:11,435
Simon, you are sitting down.

592
00:36:18,509 --> 00:36:20,811
Josh?

593
00:36:20,912 --> 00:36:29,253
Was it-- take brown acid earth.

594
00:36:29,353 --> 00:36:31,522
Don't take brown acid.

595
00:36:35,326 --> 00:36:38,896
Josh, I took the brown acid, man.

596
00:37:15,333 --> 00:37:16,767
What?

597
00:37:16,867 --> 00:37:17,635
Oh, shit.

598
00:37:17,735 --> 00:37:20,705
Oh my God, you didn't see me.

599
00:37:20,805 --> 00:37:22,907
You didn't see me.

600
00:37:23,007 --> 00:37:26,544
You didn't see me.

601
00:37:26,644 --> 00:37:27,445
Damn.

602
00:37:30,281 --> 00:37:31,882
Did you see that?

603
00:37:31,983 --> 00:37:37,688
That was a cheerleader, a cheerleader, man.

604
00:37:37,788 --> 00:37:41,058
It's taken me an entire week just to get her alone.

605
00:37:41,158 --> 00:37:42,960
Maybe you shouldn't use my car.

606
00:37:43,060 --> 00:37:44,462
But the hood was still warm.

607
00:37:44,562 --> 00:37:46,797
I mean, how was I to know you'd be in and out of there

608
00:37:46,897 --> 00:37:47,698
in under an hour?

609
00:37:51,002 --> 00:37:51,802
Give me some of that.

610
00:37:55,106 --> 00:38:01,112
[gags and spits] Disgusting.

611
00:38:01,212 --> 00:38:02,780
What is up with that?

612
00:38:05,850 --> 00:38:08,119
Diet root beer.

613
00:38:08,219 --> 00:38:09,453
Ugh.

614
00:38:09,553 --> 00:38:13,190
Everything ace in there, pal?

615
00:38:13,290 --> 00:38:15,793
It's just this Walter thing.

616
00:38:15,893 --> 00:38:18,362
It's kind of a fucking freak-out.

617
00:38:18,462 --> 00:38:19,930
Talk to me.

618
00:38:20,031 --> 00:38:25,870
The first five years he was gone, I missed him every day.

619
00:38:25,970 --> 00:38:28,973
Every morning, Bella, I would get up and check his bed

620
00:38:29,073 --> 00:38:32,076
and see if he was back.

621
00:38:32,176 --> 00:38:35,479
I just stopped.

622
00:38:35,579 --> 00:38:41,052
And now-- What's this?

623
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:43,854
I'm sweating.

624
00:38:43,954 --> 00:38:46,524
Your eyes are sweating?

625
00:38:46,624 --> 00:38:47,992
Why'd he have to come back?

626
00:38:50,094 --> 00:38:50,928
Fuck.

627
00:38:53,564 --> 00:38:56,000
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.

628
00:38:56,100 --> 00:38:56,934
Hey, take it easy, man.

629
00:38:57,034 --> 00:38:57,835
Fuck you.

630
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:07,812
Hey, I have an idea.

631
00:39:07,912 --> 00:39:10,581
Do you want to hit the post office?

632
00:39:10,681 --> 00:39:12,450
No.

633
00:39:12,550 --> 00:39:16,187
I'm just going to sack out.

634
00:39:16,287 --> 00:39:20,624
Go find your cheerleader.

635
00:39:20,725 --> 00:39:24,261
I would, but she's probably off sucking some quarterback's

636
00:39:24,361 --> 00:39:25,563
cock right now trying to prove to herself

637
00:39:25,663 --> 00:39:27,098
that she's still normal.

638
00:39:30,301 --> 00:39:33,104
Good night, Bella.

639
00:39:33,204 --> 00:39:34,138
Goodnight, Josh.

640
00:39:43,614 --> 00:39:45,449
Goodnight of the Living Dead.

641
00:39:45,549 --> 00:39:48,686
Goodnight of the living Grateful Dead.

642
00:39:48,786 --> 00:39:52,423
Goodnight of the living Grateful Dead Kennedys.

643
00:39:59,563 --> 00:40:04,101
I've got to pee, got to pee, got to pee, got to pee.

644
00:40:13,544 --> 00:40:14,445
[police sirens]

645
00:40:14,545 --> 00:40:15,412
Got to pee.

646
00:40:15,513 --> 00:40:17,414
Oh, shit.

647
00:40:17,515 --> 00:40:18,616
Oh, fuck.

648
00:40:48,112 --> 00:40:51,849
You know you ran a stop sign back there?

649
00:40:51,949 --> 00:40:53,150
Yes sir, ma'am.

650
00:40:56,253 --> 00:40:59,590
You doing OK there?

651
00:40:59,690 --> 00:41:02,827
You been drinking this evening? - No.

652
00:41:02,927 --> 00:41:04,762
Can I see your driver's license?

653
00:41:14,104 --> 00:41:17,074
You want to step out of the car for me, Josh?

654
00:41:28,085 --> 00:41:31,655
You want to hold out your hands, close your eyes for me?

655
00:41:31,755 --> 00:41:33,991
You want to go ahead and touch your nose with each hand.

656
00:41:39,597 --> 00:41:40,998
You can open your eyes now.

657
00:41:44,501 --> 00:41:47,938
I'd like you to walk that line for me.

658
00:41:48,038 --> 00:41:49,206
I'd like to but--

659
00:41:52,776 --> 00:41:56,313
look, I have to pee badly.

660
00:41:56,413 --> 00:41:57,748
You have to what?

661
00:41:57,848 --> 00:42:00,217
I had five diet root beers, and I'm going to piss

662
00:42:00,317 --> 00:42:02,052
my pants if I don't pee.

663
00:42:02,152 --> 00:42:04,555
Look, I'm going to pee against the fence.

664
00:42:04,655 --> 00:42:06,757
And I'll come back and walk the line.

665
00:42:06,857 --> 00:42:08,592
I'm afraid I can't let you do that.

666
00:42:08,692 --> 00:42:10,461
I'm going to pee, and then I'll come back

667
00:42:10,561 --> 00:42:13,330
and walk the line on my hands.

668
00:42:13,430 --> 00:42:15,165
Look, I feel for you.

669
00:42:15,266 --> 00:42:16,500
I do.

670
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:19,837
But if you go pee in those bushes,

671
00:42:19,937 --> 00:42:22,406
I'm going to have to arrest you for public urination.

672
00:42:22,506 --> 00:42:23,841
What?

673
00:42:23,941 --> 00:42:27,578
Public urination, I'm going to have to arrest you.

674
00:42:27,678 --> 00:42:29,513
Look, I'm going to pee.

675
00:42:29,613 --> 00:42:30,748
And then you can cuff me.

676
00:42:41,558 --> 00:42:43,727
Oh, thank you, God.

677
00:43:07,318 --> 00:43:09,153
Hello, Josh.

678
00:43:09,253 --> 00:43:13,490
After dinner they asked me if I wanted to spend the night.

679
00:43:13,591 --> 00:43:15,259
If you don't like it I'll leave.

680
00:43:15,359 --> 00:43:18,529
How come you told them you had a wife and kids?

681
00:43:18,629 --> 00:43:22,232
Well, makes my job easier if people

682
00:43:22,333 --> 00:43:26,236
think I'm just a normal guy with a suburban life.

683
00:43:26,337 --> 00:43:28,072
Transfer and storage?

684
00:43:28,172 --> 00:43:30,908
Transfer and storage, that's me.

685
00:43:36,413 --> 00:43:37,748
Did you get high tonight, Josh?

686
00:43:40,117 --> 00:43:41,819
Not that I'm against drugs, Josh.

687
00:43:41,919 --> 00:43:44,955
On the contrary, I'm all for them.

688
00:43:45,055 --> 00:43:47,992
I wish more people would use them.

689
00:43:48,092 --> 00:43:50,394
People who are using can be made to do anything you want.

690
00:43:57,501 --> 00:44:00,504
You know what I mean, Josh?

691
00:44:00,604 --> 00:44:04,508
Hey, do you remember these?

692
00:44:04,608 --> 00:44:08,512
The Bandito brothers, together forever.

693
00:44:08,612 --> 00:44:10,447
Together forever.

694
00:44:10,547 --> 00:44:14,451
Si, together forever.

695
00:44:14,551 --> 00:44:18,922
Sworn by the sacred blood oath.

696
00:44:19,023 --> 00:44:24,995
You remember the sacred blood oath, don't you, Josh?

697
00:44:25,095 --> 00:44:27,197
Fucking [inaudible], Walter.

698
00:44:49,286 --> 00:44:51,555
OK, here you go, dear.

699
00:44:51,655 --> 00:44:54,491
Fresh squeezed.

700
00:44:54,591 --> 00:44:56,994
Thank you very much.

701
00:44:57,094 --> 00:44:58,395
What are these appointments you have?

702
00:44:58,495 --> 00:45:00,130
WALTER: Well, you know, it's transfer and storage.

703
00:45:00,230 --> 00:45:04,201
Oh, Josh, Walter has some business meetings set up today,

704
00:45:04,301 --> 00:45:07,071
and he'd like you to go along. - What do you say, Josh?

705
00:45:07,171 --> 00:45:09,773
Would you like to go to work with your big brother?

706
00:45:09,873 --> 00:45:11,475
As long as you're both home in time for dinner.

707
00:45:18,048 --> 00:45:19,917
JOSH: You didn't tell me we were going out of town, Walter.

708
00:45:20,017 --> 00:45:22,086
WALTER: Well, we're taking the show on the road, Josh.

709
00:45:22,186 --> 00:45:23,921
With this job, you get to see the world.

710
00:45:28,759 --> 00:45:30,627
[music playing]

711
00:45:30,727 --> 00:45:35,199
(SINGING) Confession, [inaudible]..

712
00:45:39,036 --> 00:45:44,475
Absolution, everything is perfect here.

713
00:45:44,575 --> 00:45:46,443
Fuck it up and speak it.

714
00:45:46,543 --> 00:45:52,249
Yeah, [inaudible]

715
00:45:52,349 --> 00:45:54,551
So then I call the moving company from the switch box,

716
00:45:54,651 --> 00:45:57,254
and cancel the moving reservations.

717
00:45:57,354 --> 00:45:59,156
When the moving company calls back to confirm,

718
00:45:59,256 --> 00:45:59,990
I take the call.

719
00:46:00,090 --> 00:46:02,226
Tell them we changed our minds.

720
00:46:02,326 --> 00:46:05,429
Sorry to call and cancel, but we just love the house too much.

721
00:46:05,529 --> 00:46:06,363
We don't want to leave.

722
00:46:06,463 --> 00:46:07,931
It's simple.

723
00:46:08,031 --> 00:46:10,400
Basically we pull up, and they gave us everything they own.

724
00:46:10,501 --> 00:46:11,702
Most times you get lemonade.

725
00:46:11,802 --> 00:46:12,836
Sometimes you can get tip.

726
00:46:16,807 --> 00:46:17,641
Hey, guy.

727
00:46:17,741 --> 00:46:19,143
I got to go to work.

728
00:46:19,243 --> 00:46:21,011
My wife's still busy packing her precious [inaudible]..

729
00:46:21,111 --> 00:46:23,614
So if you break anything, you deal with her, OK?

730
00:46:23,714 --> 00:46:24,548
OK.

731
00:46:27,818 --> 00:46:29,953
It's a simple trick, Josh.

732
00:46:30,053 --> 00:46:33,557
You want to take it, or do you want to pass?

733
00:46:33,657 --> 00:46:35,425
Lemonade?

734
00:46:35,526 --> 00:46:36,360
I'll take it.

735
00:46:44,034 --> 00:46:45,335
Nice one, Walter.

736
00:46:51,041 --> 00:46:53,477
I'll take the brass duck bookends, Pat.

737
00:46:56,947 --> 00:47:00,017
[sobbing]

738
00:47:07,124 --> 00:47:07,925
Oh.

739
00:47:12,229 --> 00:47:13,063
Thank you.

740
00:47:15,799 --> 00:47:17,501
Will you finish this?

741
00:47:17,601 --> 00:47:18,969
Yeah.

742
00:47:19,069 --> 00:47:21,505
I have to find a Prozac that hasn't been packed away.

743
00:47:33,250 --> 00:47:35,252
WOMAN: Guys, I'm sorry, but I've got to go.

744
00:47:35,352 --> 00:47:37,054
This is just for moving me out.

745
00:47:37,154 --> 00:47:38,822
Understand that there will be more when you move me back in.

746
00:47:38,922 --> 00:47:40,857
How's it going in there, Bob?

747
00:47:40,958 --> 00:47:42,125
Fine.

748
00:47:42,226 --> 00:47:43,560
We get paid by the hour.

749
00:47:43,660 --> 00:47:44,595
Let's not take advantage.

750
00:47:44,695 --> 00:47:45,796
WOMAN: Don't break anything.

751
00:47:45,896 --> 00:47:47,564
[inaudible]

752
00:47:50,067 --> 00:47:52,803
A $10 tip, $10?

753
00:47:52,903 --> 00:47:54,938
Hey, she was well-intentioned.

754
00:47:55,038 --> 00:47:56,173
I think it was a nice gesture.

755
00:48:07,551 --> 00:48:09,820
Shit.

756
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:11,788
No.

757
00:48:11,888 --> 00:48:12,789
What the fuck is going on?

758
00:48:12,890 --> 00:48:13,790
It's stuck?

759
00:48:13,890 --> 00:48:16,260
No, I think we hit something.

760
00:48:16,360 --> 00:48:17,227
We're stuck.

761
00:48:23,834 --> 00:48:25,235
Oh, man.

762
00:48:25,335 --> 00:48:28,238
The landing gear is dug it.

763
00:48:28,338 --> 00:48:29,873
Oh, damn.

764
00:48:29,973 --> 00:48:31,275
All this stolen shit and we're stuck?

765
00:48:31,375 --> 00:48:32,643
You think you can back it down?

766
00:48:32,743 --> 00:48:33,577
All right.

767
00:48:38,849 --> 00:48:40,951
No, the wheel is just spinning.

768
00:48:41,051 --> 00:48:42,019
I don't know about this grade.

769
00:48:42,119 --> 00:48:42,986
It's too steep.

770
00:48:43,086 --> 00:48:44,388
I don't trust the brakes.

771
00:48:44,488 --> 00:48:47,591
Turn it off.

772
00:48:47,691 --> 00:48:48,925
Yeah, turn it off.

773
00:48:49,026 --> 00:48:50,594
You got to give it some weight off the back end.

774
00:48:53,230 --> 00:48:55,332
Yeah, you're dug in all right.

775
00:48:55,432 --> 00:48:58,201
Yeah, trucks get stuck here all the time.

776
00:48:58,302 --> 00:49:00,804
You got a compound low in there?

777
00:49:00,904 --> 00:49:02,306
Yeah.

778
00:49:02,406 --> 00:49:04,141
I used to drive trucks full-time.

779
00:49:04,241 --> 00:49:06,076
If you don't think it'd be a problem with your insurance,

780
00:49:06,176 --> 00:49:07,978
I can give it a shot.

781
00:49:08,078 --> 00:49:09,713
I don't know, man.

782
00:49:09,813 --> 00:49:11,081
Hey, no problem.

783
00:49:11,181 --> 00:49:13,216
I mean, I'm just waiting on my ride to work.

784
00:49:16,953 --> 00:49:20,390
Well, what do you want to do?

785
00:49:20,490 --> 00:49:24,294
[police siren]

786
00:49:28,665 --> 00:49:30,500
Let's move that truck.

787
00:49:30,600 --> 00:49:33,904
Well, why don't you get off your ass and give us a hand?

788
00:49:34,004 --> 00:49:37,040
We've got precinct briefing in 15 minutes.

789
00:49:37,140 --> 00:49:38,642
Hey, this truck is just begging

790
00:49:38,742 --> 00:49:40,377
me to drive it out of here.

791
00:49:40,477 --> 00:49:41,445
One call, man.

792
00:49:41,545 --> 00:49:43,280
Get one of those jumbo wreckers out here.

793
00:49:43,380 --> 00:49:45,182
Drag this truck right up the hill.

794
00:49:45,282 --> 00:49:46,717
And what's the fun in that?

795
00:49:46,817 --> 00:49:47,818
Here.

796
00:49:47,918 --> 00:49:50,721
Get behind and watch for cars.

797
00:49:50,821 --> 00:49:51,888
It's all right, Chuck.

798
00:49:51,988 --> 00:49:52,789
Let him try.

799
00:50:19,816 --> 00:50:21,385
Take it easy.

800
00:50:21,485 --> 00:50:22,886
What the hell is he looking at, Walter?

801
00:50:22,986 --> 00:50:24,154
He's just looking.

802
00:50:24,254 --> 00:50:26,990
No, he's not just looking.

803
00:50:27,090 --> 00:50:28,158
He can see that I've been in, man.

804
00:50:28,258 --> 00:50:29,793
He's going to fuck with me.

805
00:50:29,893 --> 00:50:31,795
Take it easy.

806
00:50:31,895 --> 00:50:34,197
FELICE A BEATO: He's going to fuck with me, Walter.

807
00:50:34,297 --> 00:50:35,165
He's going to fuck with me.

808
00:50:35,265 --> 00:50:36,299
Take it easy.

809
00:50:39,403 --> 00:50:41,071
Shit.

810
00:50:41,171 --> 00:50:43,407
He's going to fuck with me Walter,

811
00:50:43,507 --> 00:50:47,744
he's going to fuck with me.

812
00:50:47,844 --> 00:50:50,981
Hey, before you pulled up, I saw that gun in his ankle.

813
00:50:51,081 --> 00:50:52,115
I thought it was a heist.

814
00:50:55,519 --> 00:50:58,321
But you're cops.

815
00:50:58,422 --> 00:51:00,190
My girlfriend's a cop.

816
00:51:00,290 --> 00:51:02,426
Always after me to get my hair cut.

817
00:51:02,526 --> 00:51:04,461
- How old are you? - Not as old as she is.

818
00:51:11,768 --> 00:51:15,672
[inaudible]

819
00:51:30,720 --> 00:51:33,623
Here?

820
00:51:33,723 --> 00:51:35,592
Over there.

821
00:51:35,692 --> 00:51:36,593
How you doing?

822
00:51:40,730 --> 00:51:42,899
What's new, pussycat?

823
00:51:42,999 --> 00:51:44,234
Nice desk.

824
00:51:44,334 --> 00:51:49,139
My guys brought it up so I'd be comfortable.

825
00:51:49,239 --> 00:51:53,677
[plane flying overhead]

826
00:51:59,082 --> 00:52:01,318
There used to be 500 homes out here.

827
00:52:01,418 --> 00:52:05,222
They tore them all down after they built that runway.

828
00:52:05,322 --> 00:52:07,090
You can still hear all the little kids playing hide

829
00:52:07,190 --> 00:52:12,929
and fucking go seek if you listen real close.

830
00:52:13,029 --> 00:52:16,900
[plane flying overhead]

831
00:52:21,771 --> 00:52:24,641
So why don't you just hijack the truck?

832
00:52:24,741 --> 00:52:28,411
Hijacking is interfering with interstate commerce.

833
00:52:28,512 --> 00:52:30,780
That's a federal offense, hard time.

834
00:52:30,881 --> 00:52:32,382
Most of this trick, we're just operating

835
00:52:32,482 --> 00:52:33,950
without a license, just a fine.

836
00:52:43,260 --> 00:52:48,064
I think I'm going to pass.

837
00:52:48,164 --> 00:52:50,500
But mostly hijacking involves guns.

838
00:52:53,637 --> 00:52:55,805
You'll never see Walter play the gun unless he's

839
00:52:55,906 --> 00:52:57,407
got his back against the wall.

840
00:53:03,880 --> 00:53:04,681
I'll take it.

841
00:53:07,751 --> 00:53:08,652
You want a bump?

842
00:53:12,022 --> 00:53:13,423
No thank you.

843
00:53:13,523 --> 00:53:15,392
I mean, you know, just to deal the deal kind of thing.

844
00:53:21,231 --> 00:53:22,232
All right.

845
00:53:34,044 --> 00:53:36,313
Somebody get me something.

846
00:53:36,413 --> 00:53:39,516
Somebody fucking get me something.

847
00:53:55,899 --> 00:53:57,534
This is silk.

848
00:53:57,634 --> 00:54:00,270
It's a fucking piece of silk.

849
00:54:00,370 --> 00:54:01,838
What's wrong with you?

850
00:54:09,546 --> 00:54:11,247
I didn't realize he was so far into the coke.

851
00:54:11,348 --> 00:54:12,649
As long as he keeps enough of that shit

852
00:54:12,749 --> 00:54:15,018
out of his nose to keep buying what we're selling.

853
00:54:15,118 --> 00:54:17,420
People who are using can be made to do anything.

854
00:54:17,520 --> 00:54:19,689
Yeah, that's what worries me.

855
00:54:19,789 --> 00:54:21,358
Next time I say we forgo the middle man

856
00:54:21,458 --> 00:54:24,361
and go straight to the source.

857
00:54:24,461 --> 00:54:25,962
I'm with you.

858
00:54:26,062 --> 00:54:28,465
Man, when that cop pulled up and locked that fucking look on me,

859
00:54:28,565 --> 00:54:30,767
I thought the trip was going south there for sure.

860
00:54:30,867 --> 00:54:32,636
Josh didn't.

861
00:54:32,736 --> 00:54:37,040
And because you were the maker, Josh, here's your bonus.

862
00:54:37,140 --> 00:54:39,943
I guess he was the maker.

863
00:54:40,043 --> 00:54:41,911
Maker?

864
00:54:42,012 --> 00:54:46,816
Any trick, any situation at all, somebody makes the rules.

865
00:54:46,916 --> 00:54:48,885
You always want to be the maker, Josh.

866
00:54:48,985 --> 00:54:52,922
You always want to have them play to you.

867
00:54:53,023 --> 00:54:54,924
[plane flying overhead]

868
00:55:03,400 --> 00:55:06,503
[sobbing]

869
00:55:18,281 --> 00:55:19,115
All right, I start.

870
00:55:19,215 --> 00:55:22,085
44, 54, or 64, 79, 79.

871
00:55:22,185 --> 00:55:24,954
I cannot believe you.

872
00:55:25,055 --> 00:55:26,890
Old man's luck.

873
00:55:26,990 --> 00:55:28,491
That's what that is.

874
00:55:28,591 --> 00:55:30,226
Come on, let's do it again.

875
00:55:30,327 --> 00:55:31,995
Opening new territories?

876
00:55:32,095 --> 00:55:34,064
It's impossible.

877
00:55:34,164 --> 00:55:35,331
But you should have seen Josh.

878
00:55:35,432 --> 00:55:37,233
A natural.

879
00:55:37,334 --> 00:55:40,470
Give him a haircut and a suit-- whoo.

880
00:55:40,570 --> 00:55:43,573
This is fine for the summer.

881
00:55:43,673 --> 00:55:45,141
Come the fall, I don't want it interfering

882
00:55:45,241 --> 00:55:46,076
with your school plans.

883
00:56:04,260 --> 00:56:05,261
Root beer.

00:56:05,361 --> 00:56:06,396
Diet root beer.

885
00:56:10,800 --> 00:56:13,603
You better take it easy with those.

888
00:56:20,110 --> 00:56:20,944
What's yours?

889
00:56:26,216 --> 00:56:30,687
I collect the caps from minor league baseball teams.

890
00:56:30,787 --> 00:56:32,589
Single, double, or triple A?

891
00:56:35,792 --> 00:56:38,128
Can I have another beer, and another shot,

892
00:56:38,228 --> 00:56:44,100
and another one of those.

893
00:56:44,200 --> 00:56:47,170
What do you make of this?

894
00:56:47,270 --> 00:56:56,212
Well, I can't make a positive ID.

895
00:56:56,312 --> 00:56:59,282
But it looks familiar.

896
00:56:59,382 --> 00:57:02,385
It' Japanese, very rare.

897
00:57:02,485 --> 00:57:04,354

898
00:57:04,454 --> 00:57:05,321
Oh.

899
00:57:05,421 --> 00:57:07,490
I want you to have it.

900
00:57:07,590 --> 00:57:10,226
To thank you for the other night.

901
00:57:10,326 --> 00:57:11,427
I can't take this.

902
00:57:11,528 --> 00:57:13,062
Thank you.

903
00:57:13,163 --> 00:57:13,997
I can't.

904
00:57:22,639 --> 00:57:25,074
Three words, ready?

905
00:57:25,175 --> 00:57:27,477
Three words?

906
00:57:27,577 --> 00:57:30,046
Dance with me?

907
00:57:30,146 --> 00:57:32,048
Are you serious?

908

[slow music playing]

00:57:45,461 --> 00:57:56,706
I know [inaudible] and it's obvious you've been going out--

912
00:57:56,806 --> 00:57:58,408
You were at the blood drive, weren't you?

00:57:58,508 --> 00:57:59,542
Mhm.

914
00:58:02,111 --> 00:58:05,448
(WHISPERING) You know, I'm too old for you.

915

How old are you?

00:58:07,951 --> 00:58:09,419

917
00:58:09,519 --> 00:58:13,623

You're very funny.

919
00:58:15,792 --> 00:58:18,461
Strange funny or haha funny?

920
00:58:18,561 --> 00:58:19,729
I'll get back to you on that.

921
00:58:22,632 --> 00:58:24,500
Run with me.

922
00:58:24,601 --> 00:58:27,103
Maybe you better slow down.

923
00:58:27,203 --> 00:58:32,208
We could go to Mexico, live under pseudonyms.

924
00:58:32,308 --> 00:58:37,280
I'll wear ultra dark sunglasses and you can wear a big hat.

925
00:58:37,380 --> 00:58:39,883
How big?

926
00:58:39,983 --> 00:58:44,087
We'll write trashy novels using only one name.

927
00:58:44,187 --> 00:58:47,523
No one will know if the author is a man or a woman.

928
00:58:47,624 --> 00:58:51,728
They'll be amazed how we get both sexes right.

929
00:58:51,828 --> 00:58:56,733
Strange funny, definitely strange funny.

930
00:58:56,833 --> 00:58:58,735
We'll go to the dog track.

931
00:58:58,835 --> 00:59:00,603
The locals there will know us.

932
00:59:00,703 --> 00:59:02,305
They'll protect us.

933
00:59:02,405 --> 00:59:03,306
From who?

934
00:59:03,406 --> 00:59:06,042
Those snooping reporters.

935
00:59:06,142 --> 00:59:07,710
Damn them.

936
00:59:07,810 --> 00:59:10,947
Except every once in a while, a grainy picture of us

937
00:59:11,047 --> 00:59:14,384
will appear in an obscure paper.

938
00:59:14,484 --> 00:59:15,852
Me and my big hat.

939
00:59:15,952 --> 00:59:18,254
Me and my ultra dark sunglasses.

940
00:59:18,354 --> 00:59:21,291
MAN OFFICER: Pat, yo, Pat.

941
00:59:21,391 --> 00:59:23,293
Come on, you on the team or what?

942
00:59:23,393 --> 00:59:25,461
I'm sorry, I have to do this.

943
00:59:25,561 --> 00:59:26,629
You're a funny kid.

944
00:59:29,465 --> 00:59:30,300
MAN OFFICER: Come on.

945
00:59:34,237 --> 00:59:36,606
All right.

946
00:59:36,706 --> 00:59:40,777
On your mark, get set, go.

947
00:59:53,623 --> 00:59:54,657
WALTER: Hey.

948
01:00:08,438 --> 01:00:10,340
Another trick?

949
01:00:10,440 --> 01:00:11,341
Are you doing anything else?

950
01:00:13,977 --> 01:00:15,878
I was going to go pick up a lazy karaoke machine.

951
01:00:15,979 --> 01:00:18,147
But I guess I can do that later.

952
01:00:41,104 --> 01:00:43,072
Are we meeting Felice there?

953
01:00:43,172 --> 01:00:44,874
Nope.

954
01:00:44,974 --> 01:00:46,242
This one's just you and me.

955
01:01:17,440 --> 01:01:19,008
What?

956
01:01:19,108 --> 01:01:21,544
What? - Rise and shine.

957
01:01:21,644 --> 01:01:23,446
We're here.

958
01:01:23,546 --> 01:01:24,480
Trick time?

959
01:01:24,580 --> 01:01:25,381
Grad that envelope, will you?

960
01:01:53,776 --> 01:01:57,180
So what's the trick?

961
01:01:57,280 --> 01:01:59,348
It wasn't right.

962
01:01:59,449 --> 01:02:00,550
What wasn't right?

963
01:02:00,650 --> 01:02:03,252
What they told us.

964
01:02:03,352 --> 01:02:05,421
We always knew it was a lie, didn't we, Josh?

965
01:02:17,767 --> 01:02:19,836
I don't think I like this trick, Walter.

966
01:02:19,936 --> 01:02:25,074
The car crash, Josh, it wasn't a car crash.

967
01:02:31,948 --> 01:02:36,486
Dad was in the life, Josh, all the way.

968
01:02:36,586 --> 01:02:38,788
It wasn't a car crash.

969
01:02:38,888 --> 01:02:40,123
That's just what they told us.

970
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:53,503
It's all right.

971
01:02:53,603 --> 01:02:54,470
Let it come out, Josh.

972
01:02:57,473 --> 01:02:59,342
Let it come out.

973
01:03:05,448 --> 01:03:07,483
Dad took too much from the wrong man, Josh.

974
01:03:10,787 --> 01:03:16,459
One day you and Mom were in a car, and they brought you here.

975
01:03:16,559 --> 01:03:19,595
And when dear old daddy didn't give the man what he wanted--

976
01:03:26,969 --> 01:03:34,777
husband and wife found slain in a deal gone bad.

977
01:03:34,877 --> 01:03:37,313
That's the word they used, Josh.

978
01:03:37,413 --> 01:03:38,247
Slain.

979
01:03:53,829 --> 01:03:55,531
You remember this place, don't you, Josh?

980
01:04:18,354 --> 01:04:19,188
That's

981
01:04:19,288 --> 01:04:21,557
Right.

982
01:04:21,657 --> 01:04:23,226
Let it in, Josh.

983
01:04:44,313 --> 01:04:46,916
[inaudible]

984
01:05:25,521 --> 01:05:29,425
Your brother said you were sick all night.

985
01:05:29,525 --> 01:05:32,728
Got food poisoning.

986
01:05:32,828 --> 01:05:34,430
It feels like death, huh?

987
01:05:38,801 --> 01:05:45,541
You left this at the bar yesterday.

988
01:05:51,213 --> 01:05:54,116
You should have told me you were Walter's brother.

989
01:05:54,216 --> 01:05:56,485
You know Walter?

990
01:05:56,585 --> 01:05:57,720
Yeah.

991
01:05:57,820 --> 01:06:00,956
He was a couple of years ahead of me in high school.

992
01:06:01,057 --> 01:06:03,859
I had such a crush on him.

993
01:06:03,959 --> 01:06:09,432
Long hair, always brooding, real bad boy.

994
01:06:09,532 --> 01:06:14,637
10 years, he comes back a square John with a wife and a job.

995
01:06:14,737 --> 01:06:15,738
Who'd have thunk it, huh?

996
01:06:20,209 --> 01:06:23,779
So I got to go.

997
01:06:27,083 --> 01:06:29,985
You feel better.

998
01:06:30,086 --> 01:06:31,487
I'll take you out for a root beer.

999
01:06:31,587 --> 01:06:33,889
You can tell me all about Mexico.

1000
01:06:33,990 --> 01:06:34,790
Mexico?

1001
01:06:37,760 --> 01:06:43,699
Yeah, you and your ultra dark sunglasses.

1002
01:06:43,799 --> 01:06:45,201
You and your big hat.

1003
01:07:03,953 --> 01:07:04,787
Hi, Josh.

1004
01:07:15,765 --> 01:07:17,967
Come with me, Josh.

1005
01:07:18,067 --> 01:07:20,803
Come with you?

1006
01:07:20,903 --> 01:07:26,308
Oh, the Bandito Brothers ride again.

1007
01:07:26,409 --> 01:07:31,947
Mystery, intrigue, excitement.

1008
01:07:32,048 --> 01:07:33,282
Let me think about it for a minute.

1009
01:07:36,719 --> 01:07:37,553
WALTER: Fuck.

1010
01:07:41,924 --> 01:07:43,659
Nobody knows, Josh.

1011
01:07:43,759 --> 01:07:44,760
Nobody knows.

1012
01:07:44,860 --> 01:07:47,496
You fuck.

1013
01:07:47,596 --> 01:07:48,431
It's who you are.

1014
01:07:48,531 --> 01:07:51,467
it's why you've always felt empty.

1015
01:07:51,567 --> 01:07:52,268
Shut up.

1016
01:07:52,368 --> 01:07:54,770
You're my only family, Josh.

1017
01:07:54,870 --> 01:07:56,172
You're all I've got.

1018
01:07:56,272 --> 01:07:58,107
Fuck, I need you.

1019
01:07:58,207 --> 01:07:59,542
What are you going to do Josh?

1020
01:07:59,642 --> 01:08:00,342
Huh?

1021
01:08:00,443 --> 01:08:02,044
You going to go to college?

1022
01:08:02,144 --> 01:08:03,179
Fuck you.

1023
01:08:07,082 --> 01:08:08,784
You are lost, Josh.

1024
01:08:08,884 --> 01:08:11,053
I know what that's like.

1025
01:08:11,153 --> 01:08:12,922
But now you know.

1026
01:08:13,022 --> 01:08:14,557
Go ahead, go to school.

1027
01:08:14,657 --> 01:08:16,225
Live that life you're pretending.

1028
01:08:16,325 --> 01:08:17,793
But you'll always be pretending.

1029
01:08:17,893 --> 01:08:18,694
Stop it.

1030
01:08:18,794 --> 01:08:20,262
Stop it, both of you.

1031
01:08:20,362 --> 01:08:21,964
You want to live your life, or do you want to just pretend?

1032
01:08:22,064 --> 01:08:22,898
Stop it.

1033
01:08:25,234 --> 01:08:26,302
Oh my God.

1034
01:08:26,402 --> 01:08:27,837
Where did you get these?

1035
01:08:27,937 --> 01:08:29,738
Did you give these to him?

1036
01:08:29,839 --> 01:08:31,874
I want you out of this house.

1037
01:08:31,974 --> 01:08:33,075
I know what it's like, Josh.

1038
01:08:33,175 --> 01:08:34,810
I want you out of this house, Walter.

1039
01:08:34,910 --> 01:08:36,011
We're the same.

1040
01:08:36,111 --> 01:08:38,180
I know you, Josh.

1041
01:08:38,280 --> 01:08:39,748
It's in our blood.

1042
01:08:45,087 --> 01:08:47,823
Why didn't you tell me?

1043
01:08:47,923 --> 01:08:49,825
Why didn't you tell me who I am?

1044
01:08:49,925 --> 01:08:51,627
Because that's not who you are.

1045
01:08:51,727 --> 01:08:53,195
You're not that.

1046
01:08:53,295 --> 01:08:54,630
Then who the hell am I?

1047
01:09:06,675 --> 01:09:07,676
Hey Josh.

1048
01:09:07,776 --> 01:09:09,979
Where you been, man?

1049
01:09:10,079 --> 01:09:11,013
Have you seen Bella?

1050
01:09:11,113 --> 01:09:11,947
Fuck, man.

1051
01:09:12,047 --> 01:09:13,482
You have been away.

1052
01:09:13,582 --> 01:09:16,785
Parents sent her to a fucking rehab clinic, man.

1053
01:09:16,886 --> 01:09:17,753
Where?

1054
01:09:17,853 --> 01:09:18,754
They ain't telling.

1055
01:09:18,854 --> 01:09:20,222
Said we're a bad influence.

1056
01:09:20,322 --> 01:09:21,991
Her parents flipped out when they found

1057
01:09:22,091 --> 01:09:23,158
out she was a carpet muncher.

1058
01:09:23,259 --> 01:09:24,360
Hey, we were just going to go over

1059
01:09:24,460 --> 01:09:26,195
to Wa Wa and pull a few [inaudible]

1060
01:09:26,295 --> 01:09:27,730
off the whipped cream cans.

1061
01:09:27,830 --> 01:09:29,598
Man, you want to come?

1062
01:09:29,698 --> 01:09:30,499
Fucker.

1063
01:09:39,208 --> 01:09:42,444
[conversation on tv]

1064
01:09:42,545 --> 01:09:46,482
How come in these soaps, when someone dies at sea,

1065
01:09:46,582 --> 01:09:49,919
they show them two years later with a parrot.

1066
01:09:50,019 --> 01:09:53,155
You know in Texas, they can't hang a man with a beer.

1067
01:09:53,255 --> 01:09:56,292
They have to use a rope.

1068
01:09:56,392 --> 01:09:58,227
Anyone around now?

1069
01:09:58,327 --> 01:10:00,863
It's 3:15 in the afternoon.

1070
01:10:06,502 --> 01:10:07,970
WALTER: Worst case scenario, it goes wrong.

1071
01:10:08,070 --> 01:10:09,104
[knocking at door]

1072
01:10:09,205 --> 01:10:10,940
How about security on this level?

1073
01:10:11,040 --> 01:10:14,877
[knocking continues]

1074
01:10:35,998 --> 01:10:39,034
Well, Josh, I didn't expect to see you here.

1075
01:10:39,134 --> 01:10:40,269
So when's the next trick?

1076
01:10:43,806 --> 01:10:45,574
Felice and I just getting ready to plan one.

1077
01:10:49,612 --> 01:10:53,816
You could take it, or you can pass.

1078
01:10:58,787 --> 01:10:59,622
I'll take it.

1079
01:11:21,910 --> 01:11:22,745
It's OK, Josh.

1080
01:11:22,845 --> 01:11:26,081
This is my friend, Rubicon Beziqui.

1081
01:11:26,181 --> 01:11:27,449
Good to know you, Josh.

1082
01:11:27,549 --> 01:11:29,184
Always be the maker, huh, Walter?

1083
01:11:29,285 --> 01:11:31,387
What can I say? I wasn't getting in.

1084
01:11:31,487 --> 01:11:33,455
You're a tough guy to convince, Josh.

1085
01:11:33,555 --> 01:11:34,523
We going to do this or what?

1086
01:11:34,623 --> 01:11:35,791
Did you delay the ambulance?

1087
01:11:35,891 --> 01:11:36,625
Got us 15 minutes.

1088
01:11:36,725 --> 01:11:39,028
Better be cool with the clock.

1089
01:11:39,128 --> 01:11:40,629
Here's your paperwork.

1090
01:11:40,729 --> 01:11:42,865
Make sure they sign, give them the receipt, you're good to go.

1091
01:11:46,068 --> 01:11:47,369
So what's the trick?

1092
01:11:47,469 --> 01:11:49,438
He wants to know what the trick is.

1093
01:11:49,538 --> 01:11:51,340
You can't learn anything, Josh, if somebody answers

1094
01:11:51,440 --> 01:11:52,875
all the questions for you.

1095
01:11:52,975 --> 01:11:53,776
Think.

1096
01:11:53,876 --> 01:11:56,045
We're in a hospital.

1097
01:11:56,145 --> 01:11:58,213
Can you inject it?

1098
01:11:58,313 --> 01:11:59,782
No.

1099
01:11:59,882 --> 01:12:00,949
Can you swallow it?

1100
01:12:01,050 --> 01:12:02,484
You mean like pills?

1101
01:12:02,584 --> 01:12:04,186
Yeah, like pills.

1102
01:12:04,286 --> 01:12:05,087
No.

1103
01:12:05,187 --> 01:12:06,088
Walter.

1104
01:12:06,188 --> 01:12:07,856
Josh.

1105
01:12:07,956 --> 01:12:09,091
OK, we're on the roof.

1106
01:12:09,191 --> 01:12:10,859
You want to tell us what they're thinking down there.

1107
01:12:10,959 --> 01:12:12,995
RUBICON BEZIQUI: They're thinking you just landed, boss.

1108
01:12:18,400 --> 01:12:19,802
OK, so what's the trick?

1109
01:12:19,902 --> 01:12:22,371
The trick is to move fast and short, but not reckless.

1110
01:12:22,471 --> 01:12:23,806
Come one, let's go.

1111
01:12:27,876 --> 01:12:28,744
Let's do it.

1112
01:12:53,369 --> 01:12:56,271
It's all set to go, nurse.

1113
01:12:56,371 --> 01:12:57,840
You're ambulance?

1114
01:12:57,940 --> 01:12:58,907
Up, up, and away.

1115
01:12:59,007 --> 01:13:00,476
Take that.

1116
01:13:00,576 --> 01:13:02,077
Here, here, and here.

1117
01:13:11,553 --> 01:13:12,621
What a world, huh?

1118
01:13:12,721 --> 01:13:15,391
Hey, baby, goodnight.

1119
01:13:15,491 --> 01:13:18,060
Night.

1120
01:13:18,160 --> 01:13:18,994
Walter?

1121
01:13:46,955 --> 01:13:48,457
Ah, mi corazon.

1122
01:13:52,928 --> 01:13:54,630
A heart?

1123
01:13:54,730 --> 01:13:56,665
We're stealing a human heart?

1124
01:13:56,765 --> 01:13:58,367
What about the person who needs this?

1125
01:13:58,467 --> 01:14:00,636
The person who's buying it needs it too, Josh.

1126
01:14:13,081 --> 01:14:15,484
Don't ever stop playing the middle of a trick.

1127
01:14:30,365 --> 01:14:33,402
Hey, I need some help over here.

1128
01:14:33,502 --> 01:14:34,403
This guy is stroking out.

1129
01:14:34,503 --> 01:14:36,238
I need some help over here.

1130
01:14:36,338 --> 01:14:38,173
Josh, take this to the ambulance.

1131
01:14:38,273 --> 01:14:39,208
MAN: I need some help over here.

1132
01:14:39,308 --> 01:14:40,142
I'll be right back.

1133
01:15:05,968 --> 01:15:06,668
Let's roll.

1134
01:15:06,768 --> 01:15:08,537
Where's your little bro?

1135
01:15:08,637 --> 01:15:10,906
He's not here?

1136
01:15:11,006 --> 01:15:12,975
Isn't this the part where we all get in and leave?

1137
01:15:31,360 --> 01:15:36,665
Josh, about what happened up there, trying to stop

1138
01:15:36,765 --> 01:15:38,000
play like that.

1139
01:15:38,100 --> 01:15:41,970
If you try to renege in the middle of a trick,

1140
01:15:42,070 --> 01:15:43,872
somebody is going to take all your points.

1141
01:15:48,677 --> 01:15:51,513
Tell me where you were, Walter.

1142
01:15:51,613 --> 01:15:52,881
What?

1143
01:15:52,981 --> 01:15:55,918
I want to know what you had for breakfast.

1144
01:15:56,018 --> 01:15:59,588
I want to know what you wore, what it looked like.

1145
01:15:59,688 --> 01:16:00,689
What's he saying, Walter?

1146
01:16:00,789 --> 01:16:01,657
I don't know.

1147
01:16:01,757 --> 01:16:04,092
What are you saying, Josh?

1148
01:16:04,192 --> 01:16:07,863
I want to know where you were when you left me at home.

1149
01:16:07,963 --> 01:16:12,901
I want to know who you saw, what they said.

1150
01:16:13,001 --> 01:16:18,473
It's just that I have no picture Walter, in my hand.

1151
01:16:18,574 --> 01:16:22,744
All those years of yours are just blank.

1152
01:16:22,844 --> 01:16:24,513
Did you listen to music?

1153
01:16:24,613 --> 01:16:26,181
Did you read books?

1154
01:16:26,281 --> 01:16:27,282
Did you have a dog?

1155
01:16:27,382 --> 01:16:28,283
Josh.

1156
01:16:28,383 --> 01:16:30,452
Did you have a dog, Walter?

1157
01:16:30,552 --> 01:16:32,254
Hey, yo, we're there.

1158
01:16:32,354 --> 01:16:33,188
Let's go.

1159
01:17:11,159 --> 01:17:13,528
Grab that box.

1160
01:17:13,629 --> 01:17:14,763
You're gonna deal with [inaudible]??

1161
01:17:14,863 --> 01:17:16,498
No, we'll do this ourselves.

1162
01:17:16,598 --> 01:17:19,434
We got us a mean old man out of Tejas with a bum ticker

1163
01:17:19,534 --> 01:17:20,869
and a bundle of cash.

1164
01:17:20,969 --> 01:17:23,005
[inaudible] out a plane here in 47 minutes.

1165
01:17:23,105 --> 01:17:25,207
So let's move it, gentlemen.

1166
01:17:25,307 --> 01:17:26,141
WALTER: Let's go.

1167
01:17:26,241 --> 01:17:26,975
Start my car.

1168
01:17:27,075 --> 01:17:28,143
This will only take a second.

1169
01:18:07,115 --> 01:18:11,019
[gunshots]

1170
01:18:21,496 --> 01:18:24,966
Fucking [inaudible].

1171
01:18:25,067 --> 01:18:26,368
Fuck.

1172
01:18:26,468 --> 01:18:28,370
Josh?

1173
01:18:28,470 --> 01:18:32,374
[felice yelling]

1174
01:18:32,474 --> 01:18:33,942
[inaudible] Josh.

1175
01:18:37,446 --> 01:18:40,348
[engine revs]

1176
01:18:45,821 --> 01:18:48,390
Walter!

1177
01:18:48,490 --> 01:18:49,324
Walter.

1178
01:18:52,094 --> 01:18:52,894
Walter.

1179
01:19:12,013 --> 01:19:13,248
WALTER: Stop the car, stop the car.

1180
01:19:13,348 --> 01:19:14,649
JOSH: What, Walter?

1181
01:19:14,749 --> 01:19:16,318
Fuck it man, put it in reverse.

1182
01:19:16,418 --> 01:19:17,219
Walter.

1183
01:19:55,757 --> 01:19:58,293
Not only were you going to steal from me.

1184
01:19:58,393 --> 01:20:00,295
Not only were you going to shoot me in the back.

1185
01:20:02,731 --> 01:20:07,269
But you were going to humiliate me in front of my own brother.

1186
01:20:07,369 --> 01:20:08,370
I fucked up.

1187
01:20:08,470 --> 01:20:09,638
Yeah.

1188
01:20:09,738 --> 01:20:10,906
[inaudible] fucked!

1189
01:20:11,006 --> 01:20:13,175
But I'm the fence, man.

1190
01:20:13,275 --> 01:20:16,511
You're supposed to go through me.

1191
01:20:16,611 --> 01:20:20,415
I got debts I got to get clear.

1192
01:20:20,515 --> 01:20:21,349
JOSH: Walter.

1193
01:20:21,449 --> 01:20:24,419
Are you clear?

1194
01:20:24,519 --> 01:20:25,720
[inaudible]

1195
01:20:25,821 --> 01:20:27,556
Hey, hey, hey, Felice, man, I got no guns.

1196
01:20:27,656 --> 01:20:28,723
What the fuck?

1197
01:20:28,824 --> 01:20:30,125
My guns are empty.

1198
01:20:32,460 --> 01:20:36,464
Hey, man, I'm the fucking fence, all right?

1199
01:20:36,565 --> 01:20:37,365
God damn you.

1200
01:20:42,437 --> 01:20:43,772
Walter.

1201
01:20:43,872 --> 01:20:44,906
Walter.

1202
01:20:52,714 --> 01:20:54,583
Walter?

1203
01:20:54,683 --> 01:20:55,584
God damn it.

1204
01:20:55,684 --> 01:20:56,551
Walter, you're shot.

1205
01:21:01,223 --> 01:21:03,925
Scarney?

1206
01:21:04,025 --> 01:21:05,460
You got to get him.

1207
01:21:05,560 --> 01:21:06,661
Your shot, Walter.

1208
01:21:06,761 --> 01:21:08,163
We're going to the fucking hospital.

1209
01:21:08,263 --> 01:21:09,731
You got to go out there and get Scarney,

1210
01:21:09,831 --> 01:21:11,633
or we're both fucking dead.

1211
01:21:11,733 --> 01:21:13,802
I can't do this Walter.

1212
01:21:13,902 --> 01:21:15,337
He made us murderers, Josh.

1213
01:21:18,640 --> 01:21:21,142
Now it's us or him.

1214
01:21:21,243 --> 01:21:22,244
He understands that, OK?

1215
01:21:25,347 --> 01:21:26,648
Here, take it.

1216
01:21:29,718 --> 01:21:31,019
Go on.

1217
01:21:31,119 --> 01:21:34,289
You can do this, Josh.

1218
01:21:34,389 --> 01:21:35,223
Go on.

1219
01:22:17,599 --> 01:22:20,101
[groaning]

1220
01:23:00,909 --> 01:23:03,511
You don't want to do this to me.

1221
01:23:03,611 --> 01:23:06,114
Don't do this to me and Mrs. Jones.

1222
01:23:06,214 --> 01:23:08,450
I got a lot of cash.

1223
01:23:11,419 --> 01:23:13,321
Everything you ever wanted.

1224
01:23:13,421 --> 01:23:16,624
Anything I ever wanted, dead or alive.

1225
01:23:16,725 --> 01:23:17,525
Yeah.

1226
01:23:23,598 --> 01:23:24,399
Here.

1227
01:23:27,469 --> 01:23:30,572
That's $100,000.

1228
01:23:30,672 --> 01:23:33,508
Just take it and I'm gone.

1229
01:23:33,608 --> 01:23:34,442
Gone with the wind.

1230
01:23:40,248 --> 01:23:42,083
How old are you, anyway?

1231
01:23:42,183 --> 01:23:44,652
Shut up.

1232
01:23:44,753 --> 01:23:45,720
You know, I have son.

1233
01:23:49,357 --> 01:23:50,425
He's about your age.

1234
01:23:50,525 --> 01:23:52,594
Shut up.

1235
01:23:52,694 --> 01:23:54,362
You want me to tell you what his name is?

1236
01:23:57,866 --> 01:23:58,700
Come on, kid.

1237
01:24:01,770 --> 01:24:02,670
Fuck.

1238
01:24:02,771 --> 01:24:06,241
[gunshots]

1239
01:24:14,783 --> 01:24:15,583
You get him?

1240
01:24:20,121 --> 01:24:21,156
Atta boy.

1241
01:24:36,004 --> 01:24:37,739
Where are you going?

1242
01:24:37,839 --> 01:24:39,374
I'm taking you to the hospital.

1243
01:24:39,474 --> 01:24:41,242
No, you took this trick, Josh.

1244
01:24:41,342 --> 01:24:42,777
You said you were in.

1245
01:24:42,877 --> 01:24:45,780
Turn left up here.

1246
01:24:45,880 --> 01:24:48,116
Turn left.

1247
01:24:48,216 --> 01:24:50,185
You believe this shit?

1248
01:24:50,285 --> 01:24:53,288
Lucky fucking shot.

1249
01:24:53,388 --> 01:24:55,056
Well, even a blind chicken gets a piece of corn

1250
01:24:55,156 --> 01:24:58,460
every once in awhile, huh?

1251
01:24:58,560 --> 01:24:59,227
Fuck.

1252
01:24:59,327 --> 01:25:00,795
Felice, Walter.

1253
01:25:00,895 --> 01:25:01,996
And Rubicon.

1254
01:25:02,097 --> 01:25:03,731
They're out.

1255
01:25:03,832 --> 01:25:04,933
Felice is out.

1256
01:25:05,033 --> 01:25:07,235
Rubicon is out.

1257
01:25:07,335 --> 01:25:09,971
And Scarney's out.

1258
01:25:10,071 --> 01:25:12,874
We're still in.

1259
01:25:12,974 --> 01:25:15,844
[sirens]

1260
01:25:15,944 --> 01:25:16,778
It's OK.

1261
01:25:16,878 --> 01:25:18,446
They don't see us, Josh.

1262
01:25:18,546 --> 01:25:21,349
We're square Joe's in an American car.

1263
01:25:21,449 --> 01:25:22,784
We're on our way home.

1264
01:25:22,884 --> 01:25:23,718
From work.

1265
01:25:26,221 --> 01:25:28,790
We work together.

1266
01:25:28,890 --> 01:25:30,792
Family business.

1267
01:25:30,892 --> 01:25:32,760
That's right.

1268
01:25:32,861 --> 01:25:33,761
We're brothers.

1269
01:25:40,001 --> 01:25:43,104
We just finished this trick, then we counted the points.

1270
01:25:43,204 --> 01:25:44,172
And it's over.

1271
01:25:44,272 --> 01:25:45,373
It's over now.

1272
01:25:45,473 --> 01:25:46,741
No, it's not over.

1273
01:25:46,841 --> 01:25:48,610
It's over now.

1274
01:25:48,710 --> 01:25:53,314
I left the heart at the hospital

1275
01:25:53,414 --> 01:25:55,316
when you were dealing with the doctor.

1276
01:25:58,186 --> 01:26:02,056
You left the heart at the hospital?

1277
01:26:02,156 --> 01:26:05,026
I couldn't take it.

1278
01:26:05,126 --> 01:26:07,061
You couldn't take a simple trick.

1279
01:26:07,161 --> 01:26:10,532
I couldn't take someone's life.

1280
01:26:10,632 --> 01:26:11,432
Christ.

1281
01:26:25,680 --> 01:26:27,649
Everybody wants to do tricks, Josh.

1282
01:26:27,749 --> 01:26:31,586
Every greedy little suck wants the big tricks.

1283
01:26:34,822 --> 01:26:37,892
Most times you take the trick, you win.

1284
01:26:41,763 --> 01:26:51,005
But to take the trick and lose, they get all your points.

1285
01:26:51,105 --> 01:26:54,375
I was right about you.

1286
01:26:54,475 --> 01:26:56,578
You're the maker, Josh.

1287
01:26:59,681 --> 01:27:02,550
Walter?

1288
01:27:02,650 --> 01:27:05,019
Walter?

1289
01:27:05,119 --> 01:27:05,954
Walter?

1290
01:27:13,695 --> 01:27:14,529
No.

1291
01:27:45,326 --> 01:27:50,431

[upbeat music playing]

1293
01:29:36,404 --> 01:29:38,005
Come on, Walter.

1294
01:29:38,106 --> 01:29:38,906
Come on.

1295
01:29:44,011 --> 01:29:44,912
It's over now.

1296
01:29:48,282 --> 01:29:49,517
It's all right.

1297
01:30:43,437 --> 01:30:45,206
SCARNEY: Hey, kid.

1298
01:30:45,306 --> 01:30:46,607
I know you're in there.

1299
01:30:46,707 --> 01:30:49,744
I can't let you keep that cash.

1300
01:30:49,844 --> 01:30:52,046
Look, you don't even have to see me.

1301
01:30:52,146 --> 01:30:53,581
Just slide it on out.

1302
01:30:56,851 --> 01:31:01,522
Hey, I gave you that money.

1303
01:31:01,622 --> 01:31:04,158
It was a moment of weakness.

1304
01:31:04,258 --> 01:31:08,095
But you shouldn't have taken advantage of it.

1305
01:31:08,196 --> 01:31:09,664
Talk to me.

1306
01:31:09,764 --> 01:31:11,966
We really don't have to have these kind of problems.

1307
01:31:15,336 --> 01:31:16,971
Hey, kid.

1308
01:31:17,071 --> 01:31:19,240
How am I going to take this trick, Walter?

1309
01:31:19,340 --> 01:31:20,508
SCARNEY: Hey, kid.

1310
01:31:20,608 --> 01:31:22,610
How am I going to be the maker, Walter?

1311
01:31:22,710 --> 01:31:24,812
SCARNEY: Here, kitty, kitty, kitty.

1312
01:31:47,201 --> 01:31:48,102
Good God almighty.

1313
01:32:18,065 --> 01:32:21,469
Fucking brothers.

1314
01:32:21,569 --> 01:32:22,603
Suck on this, Walter.

1315
01:32:26,974 --> 01:32:30,811
I think I'm clear now, Walter.

1316
01:32:55,169 --> 01:32:57,004
Yeah, fucking brothers.

1317
01:33:03,344 --> 01:33:07,815
[sirens]

1318
01:33:30,237 --> 01:33:31,138
He's unarmed.

1319
01:33:37,712 --> 01:33:38,713
Josh?

1320
01:33:43,017 --> 01:33:45,052
They shot each other, huh?

1321
01:34:13,147 --> 01:34:17,418
Come on, Josh,

1322
01:34:23,524 --> 01:34:27,028
You ready?

1323
01:34:27,128 --> 01:34:33,401
[music playing]

1324
01:34:50,885 --> 01:34:55,790
Momma gripped onto the milkman's hands.

1325
01:34:55,890 --> 01:34:59,160
And then she finally gave birth.

1326
01:34:59,260 --> 01:35:08,969
Years go by, still I don't know who shall inherit this earth.

1327
01:35:09,070 --> 01:35:16,077
And no one will know my name until it's on a stone.

1328
01:35:19,680 --> 01:35:24,852
This could be your lucky day in hell.

1329
01:35:30,324 --> 01:35:34,328
Never know who it might be at your doorbell.

1330
01:35:38,632 --> 01:35:48,409
This could be your lucky day in hell, in hell, in hell.

1331
01:36:02,389 --> 01:36:07,094
You're riding like a queen in her golden carriage.

Drawn by a team of hand-picked [inaudible]..
