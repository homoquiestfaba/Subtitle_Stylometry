00:03:49,150 --> 00:03:52,042
It's not Roadhouse!

It's a movie about a shark!
Jaws!

35
00:03:58,431 --> 00:04:00,199
Dude, you're not supposed to talk.

36
00:04:01,210 --> 00:04:02,498
Somebody else do one!

37
00:04:04,039 --> 00:04:05,833
Alright, I've got one.

38
00:04:11,535 --> 00:04:13,000
- Gone with the wind!
- Yes!

39
00:05:48,569 --> 00:05:49,302

I got 06 yesterday.

44
00:07:32,212 --> 00:07:35,774
Billy stole the cookie

45
00:07:46,591 --> 00:07:48,586
- Who me?
- Yeah you!

46
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:53,973

00:08:07,008 --> 00:08:07,892
Yeah you.

50
00:08:08,012 --> 00:08:09,004
Couldn't be!

51
00:08:10,392 --> 00:08:11,326
Then who?

52
00:08:11,579 --> 00:08:15,217
Billy stole the cookie

53
00:08:15,337 --> 00:08:17,244

00:08:40,889 --> 00:08:43,542
- Who me?   - Yeah you!
- Couldn't be!   - Then who?

65
00:08:55,695 --> 00:08:57,084
We've got to get the TV fixed.

66
00:09:11,564 --> 00:09:15,000
Oh Steven, I had such
a wonderful time tonight!

67
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:17,378
I'm so glad you didn't get upset
when I asked the waiter my fish...

68
00:09:17,498 --> 00:09:19,955
...but there was a hair in it! Did you
see the hair? - Yeah I saw the hair.

69
00:09:20,075 --> 00:09:22,503
It was all long and black and shiny.
It was like a horse hair.

70
00:09:22,623 --> 00:09:25,586
I think it really might have been a
horse hair. - Yeah it might have been.

71
00:09:25,706 --> 00:09:28,946
Listen I had a great time tonight
Elissa, but I really gotta get going.

72
00:09:29,066 --> 00:09:31,802
Wait! Don't you want to come inside
and see my kitty Noodles?

73
00:09:31,922 --> 00:09:34,659
Don't you remember I told you
about her? Oh Noodles is so cute...

74
00:09:34,779 --> 00:09:38,221
...Noodles goes 'Meow meow meow'

75
00:09:38,341 --> 00:09:40,680
Yeah I'd love to but I've gotta to go
meet some friends of mine that...

76
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:41,994
...are coming in from out of town.

77
00:09:42,114 --> 00:09:43,860
Oh I have a couple sorority sisters
coming down...

78
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:47,574
- ...we can go on like a triple date.
- Umm, these guys have got scurvy.

79
00:09:47,694 --> 00:09:50,734
- So it's probably not a good idea.
- Oh Steven wait!

80
00:09:51,045 --> 00:09:52,990
Steven don't you want to give me
a kiss goodnight before you go home?

81
00:09:53,110 --> 00:09:54,477
I mean that's how you end a date
officially you know.

82
00:09:54,597 --> 00:09:57,180
I mean not officially, it's not in any
book but, you would lean in and-

83
00:09:57,300 --> 00:10:01,017
I'd love to but this might be a
contagious strain of scurvy...

84
00:10:01,137 --> 00:10:03,392
- ...so it's probably not a good idea.
- But wait!

85
00:10:03,512 --> 00:10:06,803
Can I just ask you one question
before you go? - Yeah sure.

86
00:10:07,311 --> 00:10:11,100
Is there something wrong with your
eye? Because all night when...

87
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:13,197
...I've been talking to you, one eyes
been looking at me, but one eyes...

88
00:10:13,317 --> 00:10:14,763
...been looking away and I don't know
which one to talk to.

89
00:10:14,883 --> 00:10:17,395
Do you know what I mean?
It's kind of unnerving.

90
00:10:17,515 --> 00:10:21,058
Yeah it's not big deal really
I just have a glass eye.

91
00:10:21,178 --> 00:10:25,509
- You have a glass eye?!
- Yeah.   - I have a glass eye!

92
00:10:25,629 --> 00:10:28,755
Oh my god this is incredible!
It happened when I was a little girl...

93
00:10:28,875 --> 00:10:31,004
...and my mother always told me
never to play dress-up in her closet...

94
00:10:31,124 --> 00:10:33,654
...but I did and I put on one of her
big hats and that hat came down and...

95
00:10:33,774 --> 00:10:35,422
...struck me through the eyeball.
But that's not the worst part!

96
00:10:35,542 --> 00:10:37,494
My little brother picked up
the hat with the eyeball on it...

97
00:10:37,614 --> 00:10:39,433
...ran around the house
screaming 'Barbeque Barbeque'.

98
00:10:39,553 --> 00:10:42,201
It was awful.
How did you lose your eye?

99
00:10:42,757 --> 00:10:46,954
- It was a lawn dart. I gotta get going.
- Oh wait! Steven wait!

100
00:10:47,074 --> 00:10:50,744
Steven I feel so close to you now.
Can I see your eye?

101
00:10:50,864 --> 00:10:54,739
- Will you take it out? - Well listen,
I don't like to take it out because of...

102
00:10:55,113 --> 00:10:58,221
- ...get germs on it. Well
it's just an eye. - Oh please!

103
00:10:58,341 --> 00:11:01,631
Steven it's not just an eye, it's your
eye and that's why I want to see it.

104
00:11:01,751 --> 00:11:05,247
- Please Steven it would be
so much to me. - Okay fine but...

105
00:11:05,367 --> 00:11:07,270
- ...then I gotta go. Okay?
- Okay.

106
00:11:07,649 --> 00:11:11,287
You carry your patch with you? So do I.
Ever since I was in 4th grade...

107
00:11:11,407 --> 00:11:13,864
I sneezed, my eyeball flew out and hit
the kids head in front of me.

108
00:11:13,984 --> 00:11:16,760
Oh it was  just awful! The kids called
me sneeze eye all year!

109
00:11:17,543 --> 00:11:23,086
Oh my god. Steven,
this is the same color as my eye!

110
00:11:23,206 --> 00:11:26,416
- I'm gonna take my eye out and compare
them. - No no Elissa please don't...

111
00:11:26,536 --> 00:11:29,094
...don't take out your eye. I've seen
eyes before it's not big deal.

112
00:11:29,751 --> 00:11:34,983
Oh my god! There the same color!
Steven, there the same eye!

113
00:11:35,103 --> 00:11:37,535
Can I just have my eye back please?
Oh I have a great idea!

114
00:11:37,788 --> 00:11:41,126
- Let me try your eye on. Here hold
my eye. - No no Elissa don't...

115
00:11:41,246 --> 00:11:43,400
...put that in, it's got
scurvey on it. Elissa!

116
00:11:44,158 --> 00:11:47,066
Oh my god!
It's a perfect fit!

117
00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:51,159
I'm like looking at the world
through Steven's point of view!

118
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:56,178
Oh my god it's incredible! Steven,
put my eye in your socket...

119
00:11:56,298 --> 00:11:58,717
...and then we'll be like
blood brothers forever.

120
00:11:58,837 --> 00:12:01,928
Elissa, I don't want to put your eye in
I want my eye back now.

121
00:12:02,048 --> 00:12:04,783
Oh c'mon Steven, it will be
so much fun. Please!

122
00:12:04,903 --> 00:12:08,417
Elissa, take my eye out and
give it back to me, now.

123
00:12:08,537 --> 00:12:11,947
Oh you never know until you try.
Just like when I was in summer camp...

124
00:12:12,067 --> 00:12:14,220
...and my counselor told me don't
get into the canoe and-

125
00:12:14,340 --> 00:12:18,092
Look you stupid whore, would you just
shutup and give me my eye back!

126
00:12:18,521 --> 00:12:20,340
If you don't give me my eye back,
I'm gonna take your eye...

127
00:12:20,460 --> 00:12:22,706
- ...and I'm gonna throw it out
the window!   - Don't be silly.

128
00:12:22,826 --> 00:12:25,459
- Give me back my eye!
- No stop being mean.

129
00:12:27,913 --> 00:12:29,505
My eye!

130
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:32,511
I'm gonna suck that eye out of your
head like it was a freaking olive!

131
00:12:34,294 --> 00:12:37,730
Oh my god, you're choking on my eye!
You're choking on my eye!

132
00:12:41,408 --> 00:12:45,735
Oh my god! Steven! Steven!
Oh my god, I'm so sorry!

133
00:12:45,855 --> 00:12:47,270
- Are you alright?
- I'm alright.

134
00:12:47,390 --> 00:12:50,402
It's just when that eye flew out of my
mouth I think it chipped my dentures.

135
00:12:50,643 --> 00:12:53,681
You wear dentures?! Oh!

136
00:13:32,430 --> 00:13:33,164
White.

137
00:13:38,671 --> 00:13:39,430
White.

138
00:13:44,407 --> 00:13:45,166
Cracker.

139
00:13:49,628 --> 00:13:52,236
Can't play. Can't dribble.
Can't shoot.

140
00:13:55,935 --> 00:13:56,821
Honkey.

141
00:13:58,340 --> 00:14:01,910
Play hockey. Play hockey.
Play hockey. Play hockey...

142
00:14:38,308 --> 00:14:39,270
Good morning.

143
00:14:53,911 --> 00:14:56,544
C'mon fish!

144
00:15:01,182 --> 00:15:02,802
C'mon fisherman.

145
00:15:06,184 --> 00:15:10,234
- C'mon fish!
- Excuse me.

146
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:13,250
Over here.

147
00:15:18,255 --> 00:15:22,255
If you yell loud like that,
you're gonna scare all the fish away

148
00:15:25,386 --> 00:15:26,500
Where are they gonna go?

149
00:15:31,085 --> 00:15:32,325
C'mon fish.

150
00:15:34,604 --> 00:15:36,097
C'mon fisherman!

151
00:15:37,884 --> 00:15:40,339

Anchor fish.

Look you took my spot alright.
Switch places with me, I was here first.

160
00:16:28,152 --> 00:16:29,241
C'mon fish.
