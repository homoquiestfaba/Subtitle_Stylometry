1
00:00:44,491 --> 00:00:46,823
After my mother's death, I
have been fond of reading.

2
00:00:47,494 --> 00:00:48,654
And I started to love staying home.

3
00:00:49,496 --> 00:00:50,986
Hate seeing my father's girlfriend, May.

4
00:00:51,531 --> 00:00:52,828
I'm really afraid of seeing them.

5
00:00:53,567 --> 00:00:55,660
They think I'm cute, that's okay.

6
00:00:56,002 --> 00:00:59,199
But why do they have to
pinch my face! It hurts!

7
00:01:13,787 --> 00:01:17,689
Elaine, come on! Be good.
I'm not finished reading.

8
00:01:17,724 --> 00:01:20,158
Come on! Come with me to see Auntie May.

9
00:01:20,227 --> 00:01:21,524
I don't want to see Auntie May!

10
00:01:21,895 --> 00:01:23,886
Come on!

11
00:01:27,768 --> 00:01:29,235
How much is it?
Fifty dollars.

12
00:01:33,673 --> 00:01:34,731
I don't want it!

13
00:01:38,678 --> 00:01:41,977
What is it?
What are you doing scarring her!

14
00:01:42,115 --> 00:01:44,379
Don't be afraid! Get lost!

15
00:01:44,718 --> 00:01:45,707
We are leaving now, don't be afraid.

16
00:01:47,888 --> 00:01:49,583
I started to think about being
pinched on the face again,

17
00:01:49,656 --> 00:01:51,055
It scares me and makes me cry even more.

18
00:01:52,092 --> 00:01:53,992
That boy and his dog are so disgusting!

19
00:01:55,595 --> 00:01:56,926
I am so afraid of dogs.

20
00:01:58,165 --> 00:02:00,998
Why do boys like to play with
such horrible animals?

21
00:02:01,601 --> 00:02:02,761
I don't understand.

22
00:02:04,738 --> 00:02:11,166
However, when I think of the boy,
he looked brave!

23
00:02:12,045 --> 00:02:14,275
He's like the prince who saved the princess
as described in the story book I'm reading.

24
00:02:15,582 --> 00:02:17,880
He is the prince, and I am the princess.

25
00:02:19,286 --> 00:02:23,120
The prince used the sword to kill
the monster and saved the princess.

26
00:02:23,423 --> 00:02:25,789
Then, they lived happily ever after.

27
00:02:27,928 --> 00:02:29,020
When I was small...

28
00:02:29,362 --> 00:02:31,694
I always wish my Prince of
Charming would appear soon.

29
00:02:32,299 --> 00:02:33,425
And take me away.

30
00:02:56,723 --> 00:03:05,461
Jennifer...

31
00:03:10,637 --> 00:03:11,467
Boatman, I want to buy a bookshelf.

32
00:03:11,538 --> 00:03:14,200
Bookself!
Don't need to buy, I'll make one for you.

33
00:03:14,274 --> 00:03:15,400
Okay! Do it when you are free.

34
00:03:15,475 --> 00:03:18,069
Free day, Why?
I'm a man of his word, Today is the day!

35
00:03:18,144 --> 00:03:19,076
Do it right after lunch!

36
00:03:22,682 --> 00:03:23,671
Bath Tub!

37
00:03:24,484 --> 00:03:25,815
Desk!

38
00:03:32,158 --> 00:03:35,753
Big window seeing Brooklyn Bridge.
I've painted it in three days.

39
00:03:35,829 --> 00:03:37,421
Do you like it?
I like it!

40
00:03:37,597 --> 00:03:40,225
I hope one day I could open
a small restaurant here.

41
00:03:41,034 --> 00:03:42,501
When that happens, I think most of
my friends will not be at my side...

42
00:03:44,971 --> 00:03:48,031
Maybe, you'll leave me too.

43
00:03:52,913 --> 00:03:53,937
Maybe I'll still be around.

44
00:03:57,284 --> 00:04:00,515
If you're still here, we can
watch the waves together.

45
00:04:03,590 --> 00:04:04,989
What's the name of your restaurant?

46
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:08,391
Do you have any suggestion?

47
00:04:08,595 --> 00:04:10,654
Did your English teacher
give you a Christian name?

48
00:04:10,931 --> 00:04:12,592
Yes, it is Samuel Pang!

49
00:04:12,632 --> 00:04:13,963
Then, let's call it Sampan.

50
00:04:14,935 --> 00:04:15,993
Boatman, where have you been?

51
00:04:16,236 --> 00:04:17,999
Let me tell you, I'll teach
a lesson to those people...

52
00:04:18,071 --> 00:04:19,800
who offend the members of
the Chinese Association!

53
00:04:19,873 --> 00:04:21,204
That's right, we'll go kick his ass!

54
00:04:22,609 --> 00:04:24,201
Boatman, don't go!

55
00:04:24,644 --> 00:04:25,702
Jenny

56
00:04:28,381 --> 00:04:30,611
Jenny, the two of you are different people.
Leave me alone!

57
00:04:31,251 --> 00:04:32,275
I once knew a friend...

58
00:04:32,752 --> 00:04:36,745
His biggest wish was to open
a restaurant called Sampan!

59
00:04:37,057 --> 00:04:39,082
Jenny, is it like that one?

60
00:04:39,225 --> 00:04:41,853
Bye! Bye!
Bye! Bye!

61
00:04:43,229 --> 00:04:44,218
Bye!

62
00:04:52,439 --> 00:04:53,428
Table for two?

63
00:05:02,248 --> 00:05:03,306
From that moment,

64
00:05:03,450 --> 00:05:06,078
I don't want to wait for a prince,
and I don't want to be a princess.

65
00:05:06,653 --> 00:05:08,450
I want to fall in love with
a man just like Boatman!

66
00:05:09,389 --> 00:05:12,688
A man who is simple, brave
and direct about love.

67
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:15,657
My honeymoon will certainly be in New York.

68
00:05:16,262 --> 00:05:19,663
I want to visit the places where
Boatman and Thirteen lived.

69
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,262
I want to experience their love.

70
00:05:46,292 --> 00:05:49,455
Bye

71
00:05:59,639 --> 00:06:00,765
Washington, you're back!

72
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:02,034
Really? Ming sees Ha's...

73
00:06:02,108 --> 00:06:03,632
relatives and friends...
Everybody here

74
00:06:03,810 --> 00:06:06,904
Let them wait for a few minutes.
I'll be there soon.

75
00:06:07,847 --> 00:06:09,474
Don't hit my car!

76
00:06:09,916 --> 00:06:13,443
I've told you many times!
When you deliver goods, park at the back!

77
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:16,788
I am not delivering, I'm
picking up my girlfriend.

78
00:06:17,590 --> 00:06:19,490
Does your girlfriend live here?

79
00:06:19,859 --> 00:06:21,656
Which floor? What is her name?

80
00:06:22,395 --> 00:06:22,986
Hello

81
00:06:23,396 --> 00:06:24,158
Washington...

82
00:06:24,364 --> 00:06:25,831
They...

83
00:06:26,733 --> 00:06:28,257
They are a bit upset.

84
00:06:28,334 --> 00:06:29,858
Hang on! I'll be right there!

85
00:06:30,503 --> 00:06:34,064
They've started to blame each other
for the death of their children.

86
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:35,671
They are fighting now!

87
00:06:38,278 --> 00:06:39,267
Hi! Honey!

88
00:06:42,048 --> 00:06:44,107
Hi! May I help you?

89
00:06:48,021 --> 00:06:50,012
What's wrong, you almost hit him?

90
00:06:50,090 --> 00:06:53,082
He has a poor attitude!
You can file a complain!

91
00:06:53,493 --> 00:06:55,461
You won't resolve the problem
by scaring him like that.

92
00:06:55,895 --> 00:06:56,793
Well!

93
00:07:05,371 --> 00:07:07,236
How long is your trip?

94
00:07:08,374 --> 00:07:09,705
I don't know!

95
00:07:14,247 --> 00:07:15,043
What's going on?

96
00:07:15,915 --> 00:07:17,246
Hi! Honey, how are you doing?

97
00:07:17,317 --> 00:07:18,181
I see...
I'm heading for the airport!

98
00:07:18,251 --> 00:07:20,719
Keep one party in the hall and the other in the garden

99
00:07:21,988 --> 00:07:23,182
Just try to separate them.

100
00:07:26,126 --> 00:07:27,457
What? Why didn't you tell me earlier?

101
00:07:28,228 --> 00:07:30,128
You mean... you gonna meet me there?

102
00:07:30,730 --> 00:07:32,220
Of course, I miss you.
I know!

103
00:07:34,934 --> 00:07:37,596
Listen, I'll be right there!
Don't mess it up.

104
00:07:46,746 --> 00:07:48,737
Bye!

105
00:07:53,086 --> 00:07:57,420
Okay...

106
00:07:58,858 --> 00:08:02,089
Don't give me trouble! Just fix it!

107
00:08:12,772 --> 00:08:14,103
Okay! Coming...

108
00:08:29,956 --> 00:08:32,982
Stop! Everyone stops!

109
00:08:33,459 --> 00:08:35,654
Listen carefully, everyone!

110
00:08:36,296 --> 00:08:39,857
That day, your son, the dog,
and your daughter, the cat,

111
00:08:39,999 --> 00:08:40,966
were fighting for a dead fish.

112
00:08:41,067 --> 00:08:43,194
They fought in the middle of the road,
both were struck and killed by a car.

113
00:09:31,050 --> 00:09:31,948
You were on the plane?

114
00:09:32,719 --> 00:09:34,710
Without you, I don't want to go anywhere.

115
00:10:00,146 --> 00:10:01,340
It hurts me! Do you have a beard?

116
00:10:04,884 --> 00:10:07,717
Stay where you are...

117
00:10:13,092 --> 00:10:15,424
I want to...
I want to sleep with you.

118
00:10:15,762 --> 00:10:16,751
Where's everyone?

119
00:10:16,829 --> 00:10:20,060
Seeing you like that, everyone left.

120
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:22,192
Why didn't you wake me up?

121
00:10:22,902 --> 00:10:26,736
We want you to... see her everyday.

122
00:10:27,774 --> 00:10:35,579
Dear princess, come back to me...

123
00:10:50,530 --> 00:10:52,760
Fang, come over and have a cup of tea.

124
00:10:53,099 --> 00:10:56,193
Leave the young couple alone.

125
00:10:57,470 --> 00:10:59,335
Have some tea, come on!
Okay, let's have some tea...

126
00:11:00,406 --> 00:11:02,931
Elaine is not a little girl anymore.
That's right.

127
00:11:03,042 --> 00:11:06,068
She has known Ricky for ages, why not...

128
00:11:06,145 --> 00:11:07,544
I know what you are going to say...

129
00:11:08,614 --> 00:11:11,481
Let me arrange it, make it a big party.

130
00:11:11,551 --> 00:11:13,951
Great idea!
Come, let's have some tea...

131
00:11:21,327 --> 00:11:22,316
That feels good!

132
00:11:24,597 --> 00:11:25,564
Am I rude?

133
00:11:28,167 --> 00:11:32,228
I pretended to be a lady
in front of our family.

134
00:11:36,843 --> 00:11:38,105
Let me take a look! There
is sand in your eye...

135
00:11:38,711 --> 00:11:41,043
Not in my eye, it's in my nose.

136
00:11:42,315 --> 00:11:43,304
But why do you rub your eyes?

137
00:11:43,483 --> 00:11:44,973
The nose and eyes are
connected, stupid fool!

138
00:11:46,252 --> 00:11:47,184
Let me blow it away for you.

139
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:49,845
It's useless, I'll dig it out.

140
00:12:03,002 --> 00:12:03,991
I feel so comfortable now.

141
00:12:05,104 --> 00:12:07,197
Oh! Hold my leg!

142
00:12:08,608 --> 00:12:11,338
The gap between my third and
fourth toes... it's itchy!

143
00:12:11,544 --> 00:12:14,672
Please scratch it for me...

144
00:12:23,890 --> 00:12:24,857
Can you accept that?

145
00:12:25,224 --> 00:12:26,748
You're a special girl.

146
00:12:28,294 --> 00:12:29,955
Don't you see that, we are
not right for each other?

147
00:12:30,163 --> 00:12:31,687
No, my mother said we're a perfect...

148
00:12:31,764 --> 00:12:32,753
Perfect for what?

149
00:12:33,132 --> 00:12:36,829
You're beautiful, you look like a good mother
We're just perfect...

150
00:12:57,657 --> 00:13:00,524
Let me tell you,
I'm taking you to meet Ricky tomorrow.

151
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:03,328
When you see him, say something
nice to him, got it?

152
00:13:03,396 --> 00:13:04,658
I've got a boyfriend already.

153
00:13:05,531 --> 00:13:09,262
I know, that poor, uneducated
and not civilized triad.

154
00:13:10,103 --> 00:13:12,264
He loves you for your money!

155
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:15,270
What is his name?

156
00:13:15,441 --> 00:13:16,465
Eason.

157
00:13:18,211 --> 00:13:20,736
No, Emesson, no Erickson.

158
00:13:20,813 --> 00:13:21,905
His name is Edison!

159
00:13:22,215 --> 00:13:24,445
You don't even know his name,
how do you know his character?

160
00:13:25,151 --> 00:13:28,086
I do not need to know his name.
I know he's cheating you!

161
00:13:28,221 --> 00:13:29,210
How do you know it?

162
00:13:29,589 --> 00:13:30,749
Trust me before it's too late!

163
00:13:34,093 --> 00:13:35,754
Is it too late? Did you...

164
00:13:36,095 --> 00:13:37,084
I'm not answering.

165
00:13:41,634 --> 00:13:42,623
I want to throw up...

166
00:13:43,936 --> 00:13:46,598
Daddy, do you like a grandson
or a granddaughter?

167
00:13:48,207 --> 00:13:49,799
Sandy!
Sir.

168
00:13:50,943 --> 00:13:53,912
Keep an eye on Elaine, don't let her go out.
Yes!

169
00:14:53,172 --> 00:14:55,970
Doggie! Sit!

170
00:14:56,642 --> 00:14:58,576
Sandy, please let me go!

171
00:14:58,778 --> 00:15:00,837
I am so smart to borrow this dog from Chan!

172
00:15:01,047 --> 00:15:03,038
Sandy, you're so ungrateful!

173
00:15:03,382 --> 00:15:05,850
You always said you have muscular pains,

174
00:15:06,052 --> 00:15:09,249
You said helping you to clean the
floor would make your pain go away.

175
00:15:09,689 --> 00:15:11,179
I always know you were lying to me.

176
00:15:11,991 --> 00:15:16,291
But you've taken care of me for many years,
I wanted to give you a hand!

177
00:15:17,196 --> 00:15:21,997
Sandy, I always treat you like my mom.
Please let me go!

178
00:15:22,602 --> 00:15:27,198
Okay! Go quickly, go, go!

179
00:15:27,873 --> 00:15:30,068
Doggie! Come back!

180
00:15:30,209 --> 00:15:33,542
Go! I can't stop it any longer!

181
00:15:38,951 --> 00:15:41,419
I took Pansy's phone by mistake!

182
00:15:41,721 --> 00:15:44,212
Who is Pansy?
She is my little God-sister.

183
00:15:45,424 --> 00:15:48,484
Little God-sister? How come there is a
sticker of the two of you on the phone?

184
00:15:50,062 --> 00:15:52,257
It was taken some time ago!

185
00:15:52,498 --> 00:15:54,693
We are as close as real sister and brother!

186
00:15:56,435 --> 00:15:57,424
I see!

187
00:16:01,774 --> 00:16:03,435
Why didn't you wait for
me before checking in?

188
00:16:03,776 --> 00:16:05,243
I don't want you to know how
much luggage I'm bringing.

189
00:16:40,413 --> 00:16:43,507
Why do you bring so much luggage with you?
Are you running away?

190
00:16:44,884 --> 00:16:48,820
It's hot, so I bought more
clothes to change into.

191
00:16:50,156 --> 00:16:54,149
And I've brought this painting,
I want to finish for you.

192
00:16:54,927 --> 00:16:56,087
I'll let you see?

193
00:16:56,696 --> 00:16:58,459
No, it's quite inconvenient here.

194
00:16:59,065 --> 00:17:03,764
Actually, you should finish it first!
Show it to me when it is finished, right?

195
00:17:04,403 --> 00:17:05,301
That's right.

196
00:17:07,106 --> 00:17:08,095
Wait here...

197
00:17:13,112 --> 00:17:14,739
Excuse me!
Excuse me, let me help you.

198
00:17:16,315 --> 00:17:17,304
Oh! Thank you.

199
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:23,482
Let me help you, take care...

200
00:17:47,146 --> 00:17:50,547
No! I am afraid of dogs!
Don't panic!

201
00:17:53,519 --> 00:17:55,350
Doggie, let me show you to your master.

202
00:18:04,764 --> 00:18:05,958
What are you thinking about?

203
00:18:08,634 --> 00:18:09,623
Edison...

204
00:18:11,036 --> 00:18:12,799
I had a nightmare, it's horrible!

205
00:18:13,439 --> 00:18:16,499
It's just a dream! Don't need to be scared.

206
00:18:17,810 --> 00:18:22,372
In my dream, I was no longer rich.
Therefore, you left me.

207
00:18:24,250 --> 00:18:27,583
Silly girl! I love you, not your money.

208
00:18:27,820 --> 00:18:32,052
No matter who you are,
I love you forever.

209
00:18:34,927 --> 00:18:35,723
What are you laughing at?

210
00:18:36,595 --> 00:18:38,392
I am laughing because you
trust people too easily.

211
00:18:38,798 --> 00:18:41,733
Excuse me, did I take your girlfriend or
killed your parents? What did I do to you?

212
00:18:41,934 --> 00:18:47,463
I am sorry. You are wrong on both.
First, I am an orphan, second, I am a gay.

213
00:18:48,674 --> 00:18:50,733
It's not wise to trust easily in this world,

214
00:18:51,710 --> 00:18:53,871
why not ask God! That's
the Lie Testing Stone.

215
00:18:53,946 --> 00:18:56,073
It punishes those people who lie about love.

216
00:18:58,217 --> 00:18:59,206
Punishes, how?

217
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:04,083
See the handicapped beggar over there?

218
00:19:04,590 --> 00:19:08,082
He used to be very handsome.

219
00:19:09,228 --> 00:19:10,820
To bad he didn't treat love seriously.

220
00:19:10,930 --> 00:19:14,229
Before he never had a job,
he lived of women's money.

221
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:17,167
One day, he came with a woman to swear
in front of the Lie Testing Stone,

222
00:19:17,436 --> 00:19:18,835
He had guts to lie in front of it,

223
00:19:18,904 --> 00:19:24,433
when he put his hand into the stone's mouth,
and said his lie,

224
00:19:24,610 --> 00:19:27,841
the 'Lie Testing Stone' bit
his hand off because he lied.

225
00:19:28,948 --> 00:19:31,644
His hand... was forever gone.

226
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:38,281
Why don't you ask him to try?
Just try, you shouldn't be afraid.

227
00:19:39,325 --> 00:19:40,314
Try it.

228
00:19:42,628 --> 00:19:43,458
Do you trust him?

229
00:19:43,529 --> 00:19:45,793
Okay, let's try in front of him.

230
00:19:46,332 --> 00:19:46,855
Do you mean it?

231
00:19:46,966 --> 00:19:48,957
Of course! Tell the world
that you love me, come on!

232
00:19:51,904 --> 00:19:55,738
Waits! What if he makes a mistake
and bites my hand off...

233
00:19:56,141 --> 00:19:57,608
how can I put on our wedding ring?

234
00:19:59,812 --> 00:20:00,801
Would you marry me?

235
00:20:09,989 --> 00:20:11,286
It was worth it running away
from home because of you.

236
00:20:12,958 --> 00:20:14,823
My father always wants
me to marry a rich guy.

237
00:20:15,494 --> 00:20:16,961
I hate it, that's why I ran away.

238
00:20:17,296 --> 00:20:19,161
He got mad and said he wouldn't
give me money to spend anymore.

239
00:20:19,598 --> 00:20:23,295
I didn't know how to tell you...
I don't know how you'll respond.

240
00:20:24,169 --> 00:20:25,295
Are you sure your father will
stop giving you money?

241
00:20:28,173 --> 00:20:31,165
It's Okay, I'll always be with you.

242
00:20:31,810 --> 00:20:34,108
Just as long as we are together, we'll
be able to face any difficulties.

243
00:20:36,615 --> 00:20:37,980
Getting married is a real big thing.

244
00:20:38,384 --> 00:20:41,046
First, let's find the biggest
church on this island.

245
00:20:41,387 --> 00:20:42,718
Then we'll ask the priest
to host our wedding.

246
00:20:43,355 --> 00:20:45,949
And, we'll invite everyone on this
island to attend our wedding.

247
00:20:46,525 --> 00:20:48,720
I'll put the wedding ring on your
finger in front of everyone.

248
00:20:50,663 --> 00:20:51,527
What do you think?

249
00:20:56,535 --> 00:20:57,524
Glad you agree.

250
00:20:59,538 --> 00:21:00,527
Let's go.

251
00:21:04,944 --> 00:21:07,970
Sit down! Wait for me!

252
00:21:11,417 --> 00:21:12,543
He is for really!

253
00:21:12,818 --> 00:21:14,547
Although I have no more money, he
is willing to married with me.

254
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:15,914
He is now going to look for a priest.

255
00:21:26,999 --> 00:21:31,026
Miss, forget it! No more
money, he's not come back!

256
00:21:45,517 --> 00:21:50,250
Pansy, how are you? I am your
God-brother's girlfriend.

257
00:21:50,756 --> 00:21:53,782
He's gone to do something,
but he's left for hours.

258
00:21:54,393 --> 00:21:57,590
I only have your number, what is his number?

259
00:21:57,896 --> 00:22:00,865
0932717249!
Thank you!

260
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:04,801
I am not his God-sister,
I am his wife! Bitch!

261
00:22:33,832 --> 00:22:35,925
Elaine! Wait for me, I'll be back soon.

262
00:22:36,702 --> 00:22:38,135
Do you want to leave me?

263
00:22:38,704 --> 00:22:39,693
Don't be silly! I won't do that.

264
00:22:41,974 --> 00:22:44,135
My father will never support me.

265
00:22:44,777 --> 00:22:46,836
My father and my relationship is finished.

266
00:22:57,656 --> 00:22:58,645
Okay, thank you.

267
00:22:59,491 --> 00:23:01,584
Your credit card is not effective,
do you have another one?

268
00:23:01,660 --> 00:23:02,649
I'll cut it for you.

269
00:23:14,173 --> 00:23:16,073
This card doesn't work
either, I'll cut it too.

270
00:23:17,142 --> 00:23:18,336
No...
No way!

271
00:23:26,685 --> 00:23:40,691
Anything for sale?

272
00:23:42,835 --> 00:23:43,824
Excuse me...

273
00:23:49,108 --> 00:23:51,201
Do you want to buy a computer?

274
00:23:52,344 --> 00:23:53,709
No!
Are you kidding me?

275
00:23:55,914 --> 00:23:59,907
This is a great computer...
Let me introduce it to you...

276
00:24:00,319 --> 00:24:03,447
This is the latest model,
you'll find it great...

277
00:24:03,555 --> 00:24:04,544
Come on, take a look!
No, I don't want it.

278
00:24:05,724 --> 00:24:06,713
Just take a look!

279
00:24:08,026 --> 00:24:09,926
No! I don't want it.

280
00:24:10,662 --> 00:24:12,596
What do you want? I have
many things for sale.

281
00:24:14,466 --> 00:24:16,400
That one.
The suitcase?

282
00:24:27,846 --> 00:24:34,376
Robbery! Help! Robbery!

283
00:24:35,053 --> 00:24:38,420
Stop the robber!

284
00:25:14,459 --> 00:25:17,519
How dare you take my seat!
Get lost, get lost...

285
00:25:33,979 --> 00:25:35,446
Bitch! Pick up your book.

286
00:26:03,942 --> 00:26:05,500
Am I pretty?
Very pretty!

287
00:26:11,450 --> 00:26:15,853
Thirteen, you came a long
way to study in the USA,

288
00:26:16,688 --> 00:26:18,588
you'd make good use of your time to study.

289
00:26:19,992 --> 00:26:21,186
That bastard doesn't like
you, you know that.

290
00:26:21,526 --> 00:26:22,959
Why don't you just give up?

291
00:26:23,328 --> 00:26:24,659
He likes me!

292
00:26:26,265 --> 00:26:28,199
You don't have to wait for him to say no!

293
00:26:29,134 --> 00:26:32,865
Look at you! You don't have
to torture yourself.

294
00:26:32,938 --> 00:26:34,997
Boatman is someone who's not gentle at all.

295
00:26:35,307 --> 00:26:37,741
He always tells you the truth
which hurts you badly.

296
00:26:38,744 --> 00:26:41,304
Although it's painful, it's useful.

297
00:26:41,980 --> 00:26:44,039
I have decided to forget him.

298
00:26:44,549 --> 00:26:47,541
From now on, Edison will be
a meaningless name to me.

299
00:26:49,755 --> 00:26:51,746
What a coincidence! Edison again?

300
00:26:53,492 --> 00:26:54,754
First night for free?

301
00:27:30,262 --> 00:27:31,854
Please help me.

302
00:27:32,064 --> 00:27:33,463
I have talked too much.
I told you not to do it.

303
00:27:33,532 --> 00:27:37,059
You are 80 kilos and you
want to hold it to sleep.

304
00:27:37,169 --> 00:27:39,603
It needs to breathe too.

305
00:27:39,671 --> 00:27:40,262
Next time...

306
00:27:40,339 --> 00:27:43,274
It's about life! You are no different
from an insane killer.

307
00:27:43,742 --> 00:27:46,677
Also, looks at you. Look at yourjewels.

308
00:27:47,212 --> 00:27:49,146
Excuse me, do you have any vacant room?

309
00:27:49,214 --> 00:27:49,942
Yes, please wait a moment.

310
00:27:53,118 --> 00:27:54,449
Take away these five with you.

311
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:57,213
Get away, insane killer, I
don't want to see you again.

312
00:27:57,289 --> 00:27:59,621
Please help me one more time!
No! You'd better leave now.

313
00:28:00,092 --> 00:28:02,686
Why are you so hard-hearted?

314
00:28:02,828 --> 00:28:05,490
Her dog died, you shouldn't hurt her.

315
00:28:06,498 --> 00:28:07,556
Who are you?

316
00:28:07,833 --> 00:28:08,822
My name is Elaine.

317
00:28:09,067 --> 00:28:10,125
Where have you been?

318
00:28:11,703 --> 00:28:12,692
I worry about you so much!

319
00:28:14,973 --> 00:28:15,962
Baby

320
00:28:23,348 --> 00:28:24,337
Don't come over.

321
00:28:35,027 --> 00:28:36,119
Help!

322
00:29:05,157 --> 00:29:07,318
Are you okay? How can you get
drown in shallow water?

323
00:29:09,628 --> 00:29:10,617
Do you need a room?

324
00:29:11,296 --> 00:29:12,456
I don't want to live next to the graveyard.

325
00:29:37,823 --> 00:29:38,812
Don't touch!

326
00:30:03,081 --> 00:30:04,275
I want to check-in.

327
00:30:07,085 --> 00:30:08,279
There are many dead bodies around.

328
00:30:16,461 --> 00:30:17,758
First night for free?

329
00:30:19,631 --> 00:30:20,689
Checking in immediately.

330
00:30:21,867 --> 00:30:23,164
Last room available.

331
00:30:23,635 --> 00:30:25,262
Move, woman!

332
00:30:25,904 --> 00:30:26,893
Wait!

333
00:30:28,473 --> 00:30:30,031
You...

334
00:30:30,108 --> 00:30:34,101
Do you think it's good
to hang it here? Move!

335
00:31:24,029 --> 00:31:25,553
Ed... what?

336
00:31:25,964 --> 00:31:27,158
It's Edison!

337
00:31:44,849 --> 00:31:45,838
What do you want now!

338
00:31:46,851 --> 00:31:50,184
There is something wrong with
the mattress, change it please.

339
00:31:50,255 --> 00:31:52,280
You're crazy.
No way!

340
00:32:00,198 --> 00:32:02,530
I want to sleep!

341
00:32:02,601 --> 00:32:06,367
It's past midnight, I do want to sleep too,
just use the mattress for one night!

342
00:32:07,739 --> 00:32:12,267
But the mattress makes sounds
that goes Ed, Ed...

343
00:32:12,344 --> 00:32:14,141
It reminds me of my boyfriend, Edison!

344
00:32:14,212 --> 00:32:15,804
This motel is named Edison, too.

345
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:21,614
When I think of him, I can't sleep.
When I can't sleep, I'll think of Edison.

346
00:32:22,721 --> 00:32:25,690
He ran away after proposing to me.

347
00:32:26,591 --> 00:32:27,717
You are only heart broken, right?

348
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:30,619
I want to sleep...
Someone like you had a boyfriend!

349
00:32:31,329 --> 00:32:34,560
I want to sleep...
I am not refusing to change it for you,

350
00:32:34,633 --> 00:32:36,498
but I don't have any mattress to change?

351
00:32:38,436 --> 00:32:40,028
Miss, be rational.

352
00:32:40,639 --> 00:32:41,628
I want to sleep...

353
00:32:50,348 --> 00:32:52,441
Be rational, okay?

354
00:32:54,786 --> 00:32:56,344
You are not leaving?

355
00:33:05,697 --> 00:33:06,686
Open the door!

356
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:09,589
Okay!

357
00:33:29,688 --> 00:33:32,486
Goodbye, Miss Chan!

358
00:33:37,095 --> 00:33:38,824
Miss Chan, I lost my schoolbag.

359
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:49,902
Thank you, Miss Chan!

360
00:36:39,477 --> 00:36:40,466
Pervert!

361
00:37:03,701 --> 00:37:05,669
Mo... Mo

362
00:37:06,437 --> 00:37:07,165
What's up?

363
00:37:07,238 --> 00:37:09,172
You're going to be daddy
soon, I am pregnant!

364
00:37:09,841 --> 00:37:14,244
I want it too...

365
00:37:17,148 --> 00:37:19,241
Sleep in my bed, it will bring you luck!
Oh yeah!

366
00:37:20,084 --> 00:37:23,178
Hey
Hello!

367
00:37:23,454 --> 00:37:24,716
Are you on vacation?

368
00:37:24,789 --> 00:37:26,654
How long will you stay? Do
you know how to play...

369
00:37:26,724 --> 00:37:27,713
Mahjong?

370
00:37:29,394 --> 00:37:31,259
Oh yeah!

371
00:37:41,973 --> 00:37:42,962
So impolite! What a weird person!

372
00:37:44,576 --> 00:37:45,543
Mahjong for five?

373
00:37:46,044 --> 00:37:49,411
It's a funny game, you'll find it interesting

374
00:37:49,681 --> 00:37:52,013
It sounds complicated, but it's very simple.
Yes, it's really fun!

375
00:37:56,421 --> 00:37:59,219
Let me speak, okay?
Okay.

376
00:37:59,991 --> 00:38:01,015
This mahjong game for five...

377
00:38:01,092 --> 00:38:04,687
is the combination of all
sorts of mahjong games.

378
00:38:04,762 --> 00:38:06,889
And it combines some rules of show
hand, bridge and Tien-kau...

379
00:38:06,965 --> 00:38:09,729
The rules are therefore...
Not simple!

380
00:38:10,501 --> 00:38:13,664
But it's a great challenge to our minds.

381
00:38:14,505 --> 00:38:17,702
There are six more dominos when compared
to an ordinary mahjong game.

382
00:38:17,842 --> 00:38:18,968
We have total 150 dominos.

383
00:38:19,043 --> 00:38:23,605
For the wind domino, we
have an extra red dragon.

384
00:38:27,185 --> 00:38:28,174
Do you have any instruction menu for me?

385
00:38:31,589 --> 00:38:33,181
Forget it, just come and play.

386
00:38:33,591 --> 00:38:34,580
You'll get the hang of
it after a few rounds.

387
00:38:36,194 --> 00:38:37,183
What is the bet?

388
00:38:37,261 --> 00:38:38,751
Anything would do, but no
money should be involved.

389
00:38:40,932 --> 00:38:42,092
I have no money with me.

390
00:38:42,934 --> 00:38:44,765
What? You're saying you are
staying here without paying.

391
00:38:46,237 --> 00:38:47,465
At first, I don't want to stay.

392
00:38:47,538 --> 00:38:49,870
But now, I am really in a bad mood, and
want to release my tension and relax.

393
00:38:49,941 --> 00:38:52,535
All of you seem nice, so I want to stay.

394
00:38:52,610 --> 00:38:54,009
Anyone have any job for me?

395
00:38:54,646 --> 00:38:56,136
Of course, are you willing to work for me?

396
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:57,872
Okay, let's sign a contract for one year.
Ten years.

397
00:38:57,949 --> 00:38:59,883
Endless contract.
Accepted. What if you break the contract?

398
00:39:00,284 --> 00:39:03,014
I'll have bad luck for the rest of my life.
Okay, paper and pen please.

399
00:39:04,122 --> 00:39:05,111
Here they are.

400
00:39:09,093 --> 00:39:10,287
Endless contract?

401
00:39:13,297 --> 00:39:14,286
Sign your name here.

402
00:39:19,404 --> 00:39:21,804
Endless contract? Okay, let's play mahjong.

403
00:39:23,508 --> 00:39:24,497
Come on.

404
00:39:30,381 --> 00:39:34,112
Chestnuts with big cuttlefish.
Remove the shell from chestnuts.

405
00:39:34,652 --> 00:39:36,847
The juice of the cuttlefish should
be used for making rice.

406
00:39:37,288 --> 00:39:40,121
Clean the vegetables for frying.

407
00:39:40,191 --> 00:39:44,184
Remove the roots and leaves, and fry it.

408
00:39:44,328 --> 00:39:47,263
For the knuckle, clean it thoroughly.
Cut the nails too.

409
00:39:47,732 --> 00:39:49,791
Are you crazy? Pigs don't have nails.

410
00:39:49,934 --> 00:39:52,027
How about the fish?

411
00:39:52,737 --> 00:39:54,261
Mince and juice it.

412
00:39:54,472 --> 00:39:56,702
Can you show me how to juice a fish?

413
00:39:57,475 --> 00:39:59,670
Steam it! I want everything
be ready in two hours.

414
00:40:02,313 --> 00:40:03,302
Excuse me?

415
00:40:03,848 --> 00:40:05,611
Can you lend me your phone?

416
00:40:05,683 --> 00:40:08,413
Are you crazy? Don't touch.

417
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:11,880
Take it! Use the phone over there.

418
00:40:25,369 --> 00:40:28,770
Sandy! Yes, I would like
to ask you something.

419
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:31,570
Chestnut with cuttlefish! The
big one, how to cook it?

420
00:40:32,043 --> 00:40:33,704
Wash the chestnuts and
the cuttlefish first...

421
00:40:33,878 --> 00:40:35,368
Hold on! Don't hang up.

422
00:40:43,054 --> 00:40:44,316
Sandy, What's next?

423
00:40:45,923 --> 00:40:50,519
Oil? Water? Wait...
Hot oil...

424
00:41:00,404 --> 00:41:03,931
Sandy!
Elaine, you call back at last!

425
00:41:03,975 --> 00:41:05,340
You can't live without money, right?

426
00:41:05,409 --> 00:41:08,276
Dad!
Don't come back if you have guts!

427
00:41:09,914 --> 00:41:11,006
Daddy... Daddy

428
00:41:34,205 --> 00:41:37,038
What? You want to ruin my kitchen?

429
00:41:40,645 --> 00:41:43,876
I don't know how to cook, so what?

430
00:41:44,248 --> 00:41:45,875
I don't want you to be starved.

431
00:41:46,717 --> 00:41:48,184
You can fire me if you like.

432
00:41:48,786 --> 00:41:50,344
I'll just have bad lucky if I'm fired.

433
00:41:51,522 --> 00:41:53,183
I don't rely on luck, I've always
relied on my hard work.

434
00:41:54,458 --> 00:41:56,323
I heard you had a big
fight with your father.

435
00:41:57,128 --> 00:42:00,723
Forget it..., it's okay.

436
00:42:00,998 --> 00:42:03,831
I'll cook for you! Get out.

437
00:42:12,877 --> 00:42:14,538
It's looks delicious!

438
00:42:15,613 --> 00:42:17,478
He is...
He is fond of you!

439
00:42:17,548 --> 00:42:19,743
Sure! I am so cute!

440
00:42:20,251 --> 00:42:23,015
Eat good food!
Use paper plates!

441
00:42:23,087 --> 00:42:25,817
It's so convenient!
No need to wash!

442
00:42:26,157 --> 00:42:29,058
Who say no washing! You have to wash it too.

443
00:42:29,927 --> 00:42:31,485
Wash paper dishes?

444
00:42:31,829 --> 00:42:33,820
I don't want you to break the dishes!

445
00:42:34,031 --> 00:42:35,498
Also, it's good for the environment.

446
00:42:42,306 --> 00:42:42,829
What are you doing?

447
00:42:42,907 --> 00:42:45,034
Want to check if you are wearing paper
underwear! Want me to wash them too?

448
00:42:45,109 --> 00:42:47,236
You're crazy, who says I'm
wearing paper underwear.

449
00:42:47,311 --> 00:42:49,506
Finish your food as soon as possible,
then wash the plates.

450
00:42:53,684 --> 00:42:56,847
Their mood...
it's good!

451
00:43:33,090 --> 00:43:35,081
Wash them all? Crazy!

452
00:43:36,394 --> 00:43:40,296
Why should I wash? Why wash?

453
00:43:51,042 --> 00:43:52,031
Pretty girl over there.

454
00:45:28,005 --> 00:45:28,994
Wake up!

455
00:45:31,008 --> 00:45:31,997
What are you doing here?

456
00:45:33,811 --> 00:45:35,745
You're really exhausted?
You can sleep sitting up?

457
00:45:37,548 --> 00:45:42,542
I've worked on cleaning the whole
model yesterday. I am really tired.

458
00:45:42,820 --> 00:45:44,344
Can you tell the place is cleaner?

459
00:45:45,022 --> 00:45:47,855
Sure! Have some soup.

460
00:45:48,459 --> 00:45:49,448
That smells good.

461
00:45:50,127 --> 00:45:51,116
Go ahead, drink it.

462
00:45:53,964 --> 00:45:55,022
Why are you trembling?

463
00:46:05,042 --> 00:46:06,703
Do you have any straws?
What for?

464
00:46:07,411 --> 00:46:08,969
I can't hold a spoon. A straw will do.

465
00:46:09,513 --> 00:46:11,105
It'll burn your tongue
drinking with a straw.

466
00:46:12,149 --> 00:46:14,242
What can I do then?
I don't know.

467
00:46:17,421 --> 00:46:19,855
What's that?
I am handicapped, feed me please.

468
00:46:19,924 --> 00:46:22,188
You must be crazy?

469
00:46:23,194 --> 00:46:25,059
I beg you!
No way!

470
00:46:25,096 --> 00:46:27,530
Pity me please.
No! You're nuts!

471
00:46:28,299 --> 00:46:30,597
You are not kind-hearted at all.
Yes I am...

472
00:46:36,073 --> 00:46:39,941
Okay, I will feed you!

473
00:46:45,516 --> 00:46:47,507
Is it hot?
Yes, it's really hot!

474
00:46:55,726 --> 00:46:58,194
It's tasty! Did you make it?

475
00:46:58,863 --> 00:47:01,627
You can cook!!
It's okay.

476
00:47:05,302 --> 00:47:07,896
Not bad yourself, you can paint.
Did you take lessons?

477
00:47:09,140 --> 00:47:11,301
Yes, I wanted to be a writer.

478
00:47:11,876 --> 00:47:13,707
To write and to draw comics.

479
00:47:16,380 --> 00:47:18,211
I have a story line already,
I'll show you later.

480
00:47:18,649 --> 00:47:19,638
Sure!

481
00:47:21,719 --> 00:47:23,619
What type of soup is this?
Fish soup.

482
00:47:24,989 --> 00:47:26,115
Have some fish soup.

483
00:47:30,661 --> 00:47:31,821
It's awful!

484
00:47:32,163 --> 00:47:34,631
You'd put too much ginger
and orange peel in it.

485
00:47:35,232 --> 00:47:37,063
You need to use raw salt
to make this soup tasty.

486
00:47:37,668 --> 00:47:40,535
And, you can't stay too
near or too far from it.

487
00:47:40,671 --> 00:47:41,933
Just two feet ais enough.

488
00:47:45,676 --> 00:47:46,608
Throw it in.
Like this?

489
00:47:46,677 --> 00:47:47,666
That's right.

490
00:47:47,811 --> 00:47:50,746
In that case, the taste will be balanced.

491
00:47:51,815 --> 00:47:53,646
And it'll be more tasty.

492
00:47:59,623 --> 00:48:00,647
Come on, drink it.

493
00:48:04,161 --> 00:48:05,355
It's tasty!

494
00:48:05,963 --> 00:48:06,827
One more sip!

495
00:48:10,367 --> 00:48:12,301
Can I drink soup everyday while I live here?

496
00:48:13,904 --> 00:48:15,269
I don't think it stinks when I slept.

497
00:48:16,473 --> 00:48:18,236
It's because your own body stinks.

498
00:48:19,710 --> 00:48:21,541
Go that way! Not that many
people are over there!

499
00:48:22,846 --> 00:48:24,837
No, come this side, this side is sunny!

500
00:48:42,633 --> 00:48:44,794
Miss. Why did you let go of hands suddenly?
Are you OK?

501
00:48:45,402 --> 00:48:47,267
I am afraid of dog, are you okay?

502
00:48:47,538 --> 00:48:50,200
Don't move! It hurts!

503
00:48:51,208 --> 00:48:54,006
Bring me the herbal oil from
the first drawer in my room.

504
00:48:55,379 --> 00:48:56,869
Okay...

505
00:49:38,722 --> 00:49:39,916
Do you know how to read?

506
00:49:41,125 --> 00:49:42,922
The herbal oil is finished.

507
00:49:43,560 --> 00:49:44,788
Just any oil would do.

508
00:49:44,862 --> 00:49:46,693
Massage it, and the heat
will ease the swelling.

509
00:49:48,332 --> 00:49:50,527
Do you know how? It really hurts!

510
00:49:50,601 --> 00:49:53,331
Don't move! If the swelling stays,
you'll feel great pain!

511
00:50:18,329 --> 00:50:21,389
Isn't that a call from the
princess? Aren't you happy?

512
00:50:22,633 --> 00:50:23,759
Did you peep at my diary?

513
00:50:24,034 --> 00:50:25,661
No!
No?

514
00:50:26,170 --> 00:50:29,628
I just saw a gold watch and some rings.

515
00:50:32,042 --> 00:50:35,910
How come! While I've been here,
I haven't seen Princess at all.

516
00:50:36,146 --> 00:50:37,170
Did you have a fight with her?

517
00:50:38,916 --> 00:50:40,042
She's out of town.

518
00:50:42,319 --> 00:50:44,753
Why didn't you go with her?

519
00:50:47,791 --> 00:50:52,160
Maybe,
she thinks it's more free to go alone.

520
00:50:53,197 --> 00:50:56,655
Sure! When you go for a buffet, you
won't bring along your lunch box.

521
00:50:57,434 --> 00:50:58,458
What do you mean?

522
00:50:59,069 --> 00:51:02,334
Nothing! It meant nothing.
Itjust came out of my mouth, forget it.

523
00:51:05,976 --> 00:51:07,341
How did you know her?

524
00:51:09,747 --> 00:51:12,215
It's a long story!
I want to hear your story.

525
00:51:14,351 --> 00:51:17,343
She isn't the woman I love most,

526
00:51:18,389 --> 00:51:19,856
Is your mother the first woman you love?

527
00:51:21,358 --> 00:51:22,757
I am an orphan.

528
00:51:25,362 --> 00:51:28,627
I name myself after Washington
for I respect him most.

529
00:51:29,867 --> 00:51:30,697
Why aren't you talking?

530
00:51:31,702 --> 00:51:33,101
Do you pity me? Therefore, you
do not know how to react?

531
00:51:34,171 --> 00:51:35,160
Ya, a little.

532
00:51:37,241 --> 00:51:38,765
I don't think so.

533
00:51:39,309 --> 00:51:42,039
My friends are with me,
together with the dogs and cats.

534
00:51:42,112 --> 00:51:44,706
In winter, I can hug the dogs
and cats when I sleep.

535
00:51:45,215 --> 00:51:48,184
In summer, we can swim together, it's great!

536
00:51:49,753 --> 00:51:52,722
No wonder, you have such a close
relationship with them!

537
00:51:52,790 --> 00:51:54,690
You set up a pet graveyard for them, right?

538
00:51:56,660 --> 00:52:02,599
You know, the first dog I buried...
it's named was Shrimp.

539
00:52:04,168 --> 00:52:05,157
It... Jojo

540
00:52:06,904 --> 00:52:07,928
Shrimp, no!

541
00:52:10,474 --> 00:52:11,600
It was alike Jojo.

542
00:52:18,215 --> 00:52:21,275
Shrimp once scared a girl.

543
00:52:21,819 --> 00:52:24,845
She kept on screaming! I felt so sorry.

544
00:52:27,024 --> 00:52:28,616
What a pity that, I couldn't see her again.

545
00:52:29,426 --> 00:52:30,586
I had no chance to say sorry to her.

546
00:52:31,562 --> 00:52:34,497
Unwittingly, she became the
first woman in my life.

547
00:52:35,899 --> 00:52:39,164
Later, I wanted to use my first $100,000
to build a pet graveyard.

548
00:52:39,770 --> 00:52:42,034
When I arrived, I was robbed.

549
00:52:42,840 --> 00:52:45,968
When I was most depressed,
she gave me a hand.

550
00:53:45,636 --> 00:53:48,434
My dad has a motel in the KK Island.

551
00:53:49,006 --> 00:53:51,975
It's been closed for some years,

552
00:53:53,176 --> 00:53:54,768
why don't you manage it for my dad?

553
00:53:57,514 --> 00:53:58,845
I know you can do it.

554
00:54:02,019 --> 00:54:03,008
Okay.

555
00:54:16,400 --> 00:54:18,527
So, that is...
She became your boss!

556
00:54:24,174 --> 00:54:26,199
Sometimes, I feel like being
controlled by Princess.

557
00:54:27,177 --> 00:54:28,872
Have you found that girl
you mentioned before?

558
00:54:29,713 --> 00:54:34,207
No, what is gone is gone,
I would go there unwittingly.

559
00:54:39,022 --> 00:54:40,011
No talk!

560
00:54:40,557 --> 00:54:42,855
That stupid police thought I was a loafer.

561
00:54:43,360 --> 00:54:45,760
I have nothing but a bit of self esteem.

562
00:54:46,296 --> 00:54:47,763
You bought two tickets, so you want
me to watch a movie with you?

563
00:54:48,966 --> 00:54:51,093
You mean these two tickets?
Martin bought them.

564
00:54:51,501 --> 00:54:54,902
Three rules: No alcohol, no
gambling, and no cigarettes.

565
00:54:54,972 --> 00:54:59,773
Five targets: Study hard.
Green card first, then gold credit card.

566
00:54:59,843 --> 00:55:02,311
Dress properly.
Speak and write better English!

567
00:55:02,379 --> 00:55:05,348
Do anything I want to do.
Boatman loves Tea-pot.

568
00:55:26,269 --> 00:55:29,033
I want to improve myself,
I want to be in love!

569
00:55:29,272 --> 00:55:30,261
What are you talking about?

570
00:55:31,608 --> 00:55:33,132
I want to raise my ability
to meet all challenges.

571
00:55:33,210 --> 00:55:34,268
I want to marry a nice man!

572
00:55:34,344 --> 00:55:36,676
I want him to be touched, I want
him to fall deeply for me.

573
00:55:37,414 --> 00:55:39,882
Please help me.
You're completely crazy.

574
00:55:40,717 --> 00:55:41,945
Do you understand what I am talking about?

575
00:55:57,234 --> 00:55:58,997
Let me hold you!
Don't lose your hand.

576
00:55:59,803 --> 00:56:01,964
Come on!
You can't loose your hand!

577
00:56:03,006 --> 00:56:05,634
Be slow! Look!

578
00:56:17,487 --> 00:56:18,317
Are you okay?

579
00:56:18,388 --> 00:56:20,913
No, the water is too salty!

580
00:56:37,741 --> 00:56:38,935
How are you? Do you still have a fever?

581
00:56:39,943 --> 00:56:41,274
Yes, a slight fever.

582
00:56:46,183 --> 00:56:48,344
Drink it, it'll make you feel better.

583
00:56:49,219 --> 00:56:51,119
What is it?
Cockroaches' soup.

584
00:56:52,889 --> 00:56:54,356
No, not drinking.

585
00:56:54,424 --> 00:56:57,689
I'm lying! It's fish soup.

586
00:56:57,761 --> 00:57:01,629
Really?
Drink it while it's still hot.

587
00:57:02,699 --> 00:57:03,688
It's delicious!

588
00:57:04,434 --> 00:57:06,698
Look at yourself! You hurt your
arms and you've got a fever.

589
00:57:07,537 --> 00:57:09,300
It's not worth it to improve
yourself like this.

590
00:57:09,573 --> 00:57:12,007
No, I think it's worth! I have
made great improvement!

591
00:57:12,576 --> 00:57:14,237
I know someone would fall for me soon.

592
00:57:14,978 --> 00:57:17,913
Why? Because you know how to raise
dogs? You know how to swim?

593
00:57:18,381 --> 00:57:19,973
It's no good to be that shallow!

594
00:57:21,384 --> 00:57:24,444
I can't help it! I am only pretty
but I am really shallow!

595
00:57:25,255 --> 00:57:27,780
Actually you are not bad.

596
00:57:27,924 --> 00:57:31,223
You are straightforward,
independent and strong.

597
00:57:31,995 --> 00:57:34,293
Though you are a bit sassy,
but men love sassy women.

598
00:57:35,031 --> 00:57:37,397
Most important of all, you are tough.

599
00:57:39,269 --> 00:57:41,328
You are really tough.

600
00:57:42,405 --> 00:57:44,930
So, I am not bad.
Sure!

601
00:57:45,008 --> 00:57:46,202
How about comparing with Princess?

602
00:57:47,878 --> 00:57:49,607
That book is nice looking! What is it?

603
00:57:51,748 --> 00:57:55,582
This is a diary written
by a girl named Thirteen.

604
00:57:55,752 --> 00:57:57,617
I picked it up on the
beach when I was eight.

605
00:57:58,088 --> 00:58:01,956
My life changed a lot after reading it.

606
00:58:02,626 --> 00:58:05,356
I told you about my story
line and this painting.

607
00:58:05,428 --> 00:58:06,895
They are inspired by this diary.

608
00:58:07,898 --> 00:58:10,867
That's amazing. Can you show me?

609
00:58:15,005 --> 00:58:17,269
Forget it, I don't like forcing anyone.

610
00:58:18,441 --> 00:58:21,842
I'll leave the soup here, drink it yourself.
You'll be all right after a nap.

611
00:58:25,582 --> 00:58:28,449
Take care! I haven't let
anyone read it before.

612
00:58:29,052 --> 00:58:30,110
I am going to sleep now.

613
00:58:31,788 --> 00:58:32,777
Please close the door.

614
00:59:09,492 --> 00:59:11,153
I haven't let anyone read it before.

615
00:59:12,229 --> 00:59:13,992
I know someone would fall for me soon.

616
00:59:24,774 --> 00:59:29,211
You're not bad, you're straightforward,
independent and strong.

617
00:59:30,280 --> 00:59:32,214
Though you are a bit sassy,
but men love sassy women.

618
00:59:32,949 --> 00:59:35,349
Most important of all, you're tough.

619
00:59:35,518 --> 00:59:36,610
How about comparing with Princess?

620
00:59:49,032 --> 00:59:50,021
End of classes.

621
00:59:54,738 --> 00:59:55,864
Where is my schoolbag?

622
01:00:04,881 --> 01:00:07,145
That's not a dog.
What is it then?

623
01:00:07,217 --> 01:00:09,185
That's not me.
Who is it?

624
01:00:09,419 --> 01:00:11,979
It's not possible!
Look, you really like dogs.

625
01:00:13,757 --> 01:00:14,348
No way.

626
01:00:14,424 --> 01:00:17,086
You're not afraid of dogs!
Look, is that you?

627
01:00:17,260 --> 01:00:20,058
That's not me, it's computer effect.

628
01:00:23,266 --> 01:00:24,893
Take it out for a walk.
Me?

629
01:00:25,068 --> 01:00:27,901
What are you afraid of?

630
01:00:28,071 --> 01:00:31,905
No...
Go.

631
01:00:36,913 --> 01:00:37,902
It doesn't want to go.

632
01:01:43,747 --> 01:01:45,442
So romantic!

633
01:01:52,856 --> 01:01:53,845
Didn't you faint?

634
01:01:55,992 --> 01:01:56,981
I am fine.

635
01:01:57,527 --> 01:01:58,516
You are fine so quickly.

636
01:01:58,928 --> 01:01:59,917
I am going to take a shower.

637
01:02:12,675 --> 01:02:13,664
Go fishing?

638
01:02:13,877 --> 01:02:15,708
Yes. Do you want some fish soup?

639
01:02:17,614 --> 01:02:18,603
Are you okay?

640
01:02:18,748 --> 01:02:21,080
I am fine. Have you read the diary?

641
01:02:21,484 --> 01:02:22,746
No, I have no time to read it.

642
01:02:23,686 --> 01:02:26,018
Okay, I'll tell you the story.
Fine.

643
01:02:27,223 --> 01:02:31,887
August 10, 1987,
Thirteen first left Hong Kong to New York,

644
01:02:32,395 --> 01:02:35,023
she went there to meet
her boyfriend, Vincent.

645
01:02:35,498 --> 01:02:38,490
Lightning in the east brings rain;
In the south, brings strong win.

646
01:02:38,835 --> 01:02:40,393
In the west, fine weather; In
the north, it brings SW wind.

647
01:02:41,137 --> 01:02:43,128
You learnt this being
a boatman for 10 years?

648
01:02:44,074 --> 01:02:45,405
Of course! What else do you expect?

649
01:02:45,575 --> 01:02:48,703
In the sea, a single man
only see seagulls...

650
01:02:50,146 --> 01:02:51,909
I heard people saying that,

651
01:02:52,382 --> 01:02:55,180
each seagull carries the
souls of dead sailors.

652
01:02:55,652 --> 01:02:58,052
They go back to the places
they visited before,

653
01:02:58,188 --> 01:02:59,712
they want to meet their old friends!

654
01:03:01,558 --> 01:03:03,719
Can I drink fish soup everyday?

655
01:03:04,727 --> 01:03:05,989
How would Boatman answer?

656
01:03:06,729 --> 01:03:07,889
He will be so happy to say anything.

657
01:03:09,732 --> 01:03:13,862
After Thirteen moved to the Long Island,
She missed Boatman everyday.

658
01:03:14,537 --> 01:03:17,097
Her intuition told her that one
day, they'd see each other again.

659
01:03:17,607 --> 01:03:19,074
But she couldn't imagine
that it'd be that sudden.

660
01:03:19,943 --> 01:03:21,274
On the day they met,

661
01:03:21,578 --> 01:03:26,777
Thirteen drank a bowl of fish soup...
in the Sampan restaurant.

662
01:03:28,651 --> 01:03:30,482
Thirteen didn't return to
Long Island on that night.

663
01:03:31,254 --> 01:03:33,188
She wrote her diary at the
pier opposite to Sampan.

664
01:03:34,157 --> 01:03:38,093
Boatman sat by her side that
night and did not leave her.

665
01:03:38,294 --> 01:03:41,092
Next to them, he was heating the fish soup.

666
01:03:42,365 --> 01:03:45,357
At that moment, she felt that she was
the most luckiest woman on earth.

667
01:03:46,169 --> 01:03:49,536
She decided never to leave Boatman.

668
01:03:50,273 --> 01:03:52,366
One week later, they got married.

669
01:03:52,942 --> 01:03:55,172
Yes. But their love faded afterwards.

670
01:03:56,513 --> 01:03:57,502
Why did you say that?

671
01:03:58,548 --> 01:04:01,108
I just guess... what did
Thirteen write after that?

672
01:04:02,285 --> 01:04:03,377
Nothing.

673
01:04:03,853 --> 01:04:06,617
I think she lost the diary
right after her marriage.

674
01:04:07,724 --> 01:04:10,625
I guess they must be living
happily together.

675
01:04:11,294 --> 01:04:14,127
It doesn't matter if they're together
or not, most important is to be happy.

676
01:04:14,631 --> 01:04:16,258
Why are you so pessimistic?

677
01:04:16,366 --> 01:04:19,995
I am not! The fact is, some things
in life you can't control.

678
01:04:20,570 --> 01:04:22,128
Your wish will come true if you persist!

679
01:04:22,772 --> 01:04:26,799
We're just talking, when it comes
to relationship, let fate decide.

680
01:04:27,610 --> 01:04:31,137
This is a wrong attitude, the
path you are going is wrong.

681
01:04:32,348 --> 01:04:34,145
Look at me.
Now, what?

682
01:04:35,552 --> 01:04:38,146
You lack energy.
What are you talking about?

683
01:04:38,621 --> 01:04:42,022
I can't find any energy in your
eyes, you're like a dead fish.

684
01:04:42,625 --> 01:04:44,490
Damn it!
Now, you've got energy!

685
01:04:46,462 --> 01:04:47,588
I have to go fishing now.

686
01:04:48,831 --> 01:04:50,025
When is your birthday?

687
01:04:50,767 --> 01:04:52,166
November 9, what is it?

688
01:04:53,336 --> 01:04:58,535
My name is Sampan,
I am thirty four years old,

689
01:04:59,108 --> 01:05:03,568
I am born in November ninth.
November...

690
01:06:12,915 --> 01:06:20,253
Happy birthday to you! Happy birthday to you!

691
01:06:20,356 --> 01:06:29,355
Happy birthday to Washington! Happy birthday to you!

692
01:06:30,566 --> 01:06:32,261
Thank you.

693
01:06:32,335 --> 01:06:33,632
You're welcome.
We...

694
01:06:34,671 --> 01:06:38,129
Say thank you to your wife.
It's arranged by your wife.

695
01:06:38,408 --> 01:06:39,466
What are you talking about?

696
01:06:44,013 --> 01:06:45,605
She drown, I was just saving her.

697
01:06:49,719 --> 01:06:50,686
Did you make the cake?

698
01:06:53,489 --> 01:06:55,616
Yes, I spent the whole day!

699
01:06:55,758 --> 01:06:58,818
Come on, make a wish and
then blow out the candles.

700
01:07:00,730 --> 01:07:01,628
Thank you.

701
01:07:24,654 --> 01:07:25,643
I am sorry.

702
01:07:31,861 --> 01:07:33,158
Well... I was in the toilet.

703
01:07:33,830 --> 01:07:34,819
Coward!

704
01:07:38,901 --> 01:07:40,129
One second...

705
01:11:05,541 --> 01:11:09,204
Good morning! You look so smart!

706
01:11:10,546 --> 01:11:11,535
I've got a date.

707
01:11:20,423 --> 01:11:21,913
About last night... I am sorry.

708
01:11:24,327 --> 01:11:26,488
It doesn't matter, I've already
forgotten about it.

709
01:11:32,568 --> 01:11:36,834
I forgot to give you this! Happy birthday.

710
01:11:40,443 --> 01:11:44,243
Thank you! I've got to go now.

711
01:12:23,886 --> 01:12:24,944
Why don't you take a look at it first?

712
01:12:31,127 --> 01:12:32,116
Let me help you.

713
01:12:37,199 --> 01:12:38,188
Do you like it?

714
01:12:39,635 --> 01:12:40,795
Why did you give me a measuring tape?

715
01:12:41,504 --> 01:12:44,632
Guess, how long will you live in your life?
Sixty something.

716
01:12:46,242 --> 01:12:48,267
How old are you now?
25

717
01:12:52,181 --> 01:12:54,513
Your life is only this long.

718
01:12:54,784 --> 01:12:58,117
You must quickly grasp your opportunities,
must have self-confidence.

719
01:12:59,588 --> 01:13:01,112
Who taught you that?

720
01:13:01,257 --> 01:13:02,451
My granny taught me that.

721
01:13:03,859 --> 01:13:07,590
The Boss is on leave today, so,
I am taking a day off too.

722
01:13:09,598 --> 01:13:11,031
Tired! I am going back to my room.

723
01:13:13,235 --> 01:13:15,499
I let you win! Joyce.

724
01:13:16,338 --> 01:13:17,999
Hi! I am sorry to be late.

725
01:13:18,441 --> 01:13:21,899
They insisted on finishing the 9th hole.
It doesn't matter! Come on.

726
01:13:22,244 --> 01:13:24,906
Take a seat. Fine!

727
01:13:27,216 --> 01:13:31,550
These are my friends, let
me introduce, this is...

728
01:13:31,620 --> 01:13:35,056
Let me introduce myself.
My name is Shing, I am a lawyer.

729
01:13:35,091 --> 01:13:36,683
Hello, lawyer...
Nice to meet you. How are you?

730
01:13:36,726 --> 01:13:38,455
Hello, my name is Mick.
How are you?

731
01:13:38,761 --> 01:13:41,093
Ken, I am an accountant.
Accountant? Nice to meet you.

732
01:13:41,163 --> 01:13:44,690
Dino, I am an architect.
I am a professional too.

733
01:13:45,167 --> 01:13:48,694
I am professional in burying dead bodies.
Also he runs a motel, too.

734
01:13:48,771 --> 01:13:50,033
Yes, I run a motel...

735
01:13:50,940 --> 01:13:52,237
Joyce, is he your boyfriend?

736
01:13:52,308 --> 01:13:53,639
Yes, I am her boyfriend.

737
01:13:55,377 --> 01:13:56,366
Not feeling well?

738
01:13:58,247 --> 01:14:02,445
I have a sudden headache. It may be jet lag.

739
01:14:03,219 --> 01:14:05,050
I'd better go home and rest.
I'll go with you!

740
01:14:05,454 --> 01:14:10,824
Joyce, you just want to be with him?
Okay! We better leave them alone.

741
01:14:11,794 --> 01:14:12,783
Come on! You guys are kidding!

742
01:14:14,730 --> 01:14:15,992
Today is my birthday.
Really?

743
01:14:17,233 --> 01:14:18,222
Two bottles of champagne please.

744
01:14:20,803 --> 01:14:21,735
I'll bring you some water.

745
01:14:21,937 --> 01:14:25,202
No! Stay here with me please.

746
01:14:25,274 --> 01:14:28,402
What?

747
01:14:29,945 --> 01:14:30,934
Stay with me please.

748
01:14:53,135 --> 01:14:54,124
What's wrong?

749
01:14:54,370 --> 01:14:58,898
Washington, I am sorry.
Why don't you go home?

750
01:15:00,242 --> 01:15:01,766
We agreed that I'd stay
here with you tonight!

751
01:15:04,113 --> 01:15:05,774
I want to be alone.

752
01:15:07,850 --> 01:15:09,841
I want to think about our relationship.

753
01:15:14,290 --> 01:15:16,053
We should give each other
some time for a while.

754
01:15:17,092 --> 01:15:18,559
We've separated for a month already.

755
01:15:22,064 --> 01:15:23,463
Didn't you feel anything?

756
01:15:25,067 --> 01:15:27,467
We are from two different worlds.

757
01:15:30,873 --> 01:15:35,003
Do you know...

758
01:15:35,678 --> 01:15:37,145
when they asked whether
you're my boyfriend...

759
01:15:39,048 --> 01:15:44,350
I don't want to answer.
I really didn't want them to know it.

760
01:15:50,593 --> 01:15:55,030
Maybe, its because we haven't seen
each other for a long time.

761
01:15:57,166 --> 01:16:02,001
Don't be like this, why don't we
go on holiday together, okay? I'll do whatever you want.

762
01:16:03,272 --> 01:16:10,007
Don't push me, grow up, okay?

763
01:16:17,853 --> 01:16:23,348
I still hope it will work between us...

764
01:16:24,360 --> 01:16:29,297
I tried! I try to adjust around
you, not wear high heels.

765
01:16:30,733 --> 01:16:36,399
And I never asked you to introduce
your friends to me.

766
01:16:40,476 --> 01:16:43,274
Okay, I'll do anything you like.

767
01:16:43,612 --> 01:16:47,048
No, it won't work.

768
01:16:50,586 --> 01:16:54,716
I don't want your friends to think...

769
01:16:56,425 --> 01:16:58,017
I don't want them to feel
that you and I don't match.

770
01:17:07,770 --> 01:17:14,642
Sorry, give me some time to think about it.

771
01:17:17,780 --> 01:17:20,248
Just do me a favor, okay?

772
01:17:23,319 --> 01:17:25,048
I'll call you.

773
01:17:28,691 --> 01:17:30,454
Okay...

774
01:18:06,795 --> 01:18:15,965
Open the door!

775
01:18:17,573 --> 01:18:19,040
Something's wrong.
Big trouble!

776
01:18:19,241 --> 01:18:20,970
Washington...
and his princess...

777
01:18:21,110 --> 01:18:22,475
They're in a cold war now.

778
01:18:23,846 --> 01:18:26,974
Don't be that happy.
Cure him first.

779
01:18:27,249 --> 01:18:31,379
Now, he is like a zombie.
I just want to cry!

780
01:19:03,786 --> 01:19:06,380
Look at you! You are the most
ugly looking person around.

781
01:19:07,289 --> 01:19:10,417
Why don't you say something
comfortable instead?

782
01:19:10,492 --> 01:19:13,086
What made you feeling upset?

783
01:19:13,162 --> 01:19:14,322
Being ugly? If yes, I would
have killed myself.

784
01:19:15,531 --> 01:19:18,500
Your mom spoiled you!

785
01:20:05,747 --> 01:20:06,736
Painting's not bad.

786
01:20:08,884 --> 01:20:13,082
I came to say thank you! I am okay now.

787
01:20:14,957 --> 01:20:17,949
Don't look down on yourself.

788
01:20:19,862 --> 01:20:20,851
You finally see clearly.

789
01:20:44,253 --> 01:20:47,313
Wait, it matches my watch.

790
01:20:47,656 --> 01:20:49,590
Yes. It's nice looking.

791
01:20:56,131 --> 01:20:57,120
It's for you.

792
01:21:00,135 --> 01:21:01,124
It's ugly!

793
01:21:10,345 --> 01:21:11,505
I love that horse ride.

794
01:21:12,548 --> 01:21:14,675
I'll treat you to another
ride when I have money.

795
01:21:17,352 --> 01:21:18,341
Want some?

796
01:21:42,211 --> 01:21:43,508
Let me sing you a song.

797
01:21:58,860 --> 01:22:04,355
It's so happy to be in the forest...

798
01:22:04,600 --> 01:22:09,264
My dear friend, what are you thinking about?

799
01:22:09,471 --> 01:22:16,536
Boatman is singing softly, my dear Trouble,

800
01:22:43,071 --> 01:22:47,599
someone loves tea bag.

801
01:23:16,438 --> 01:23:19,134
What's up? Leaving now?

802
01:23:24,579 --> 01:23:25,568
Wait!

803
01:23:27,783 --> 01:23:29,876
Boss, may I take a look at this watch?

804
01:23:29,951 --> 01:23:30,940
Sure!

805
01:23:32,154 --> 01:23:34,622
You like it at first sight,
it's destined to be yours.

806
01:23:35,090 --> 01:23:37,490
My client put it here for sale.

807
01:23:38,293 --> 01:23:44,163
Look, this is nicely made.
See the chain! It's beautiful!

808
01:23:44,299 --> 01:23:48,895
There are only ten in the world!

809
01:23:49,304 --> 01:23:51,704
The owner wanted to gave it to his lover,

810
01:23:52,074 --> 01:23:54,565
but I think they've already broken up.

811
01:23:54,976 --> 01:23:57,911
Since you like it, I'll give
you a special discount.

812
01:23:58,747 --> 01:24:01,511
And I'll get rid of the
words for you, for free.

813
01:24:01,583 --> 01:24:02,572
Thank you.

814
01:24:14,830 --> 01:24:18,322
I am sorry, the owner doesn't
want to sell it! I am sorry.

815
01:25:17,692 --> 01:25:22,391
Washington! Come out, your
boat is drifting away.

816
01:26:14,983 --> 01:26:16,780
Do you like it?
Not bad.

817
01:26:17,986 --> 01:26:20,853
Will you hang it out?
Later, maybe.

818
01:26:21,656 --> 01:26:24,250
Why? Do it now if you want it.

819
01:26:24,326 --> 01:26:26,453
You don't like it at all, right?

820
01:26:26,661 --> 01:26:28,458
I don't mean it.

821
01:26:30,265 --> 01:26:32,460
My room is really messy!

822
01:26:33,335 --> 01:26:38,068
I will help you clean up your room.
The new one will replace the old one.

823
01:26:41,643 --> 01:26:42,905
Let me do it myself?

824
01:26:44,546 --> 01:26:46,138
Why did you yell at me?
Who do you think you are?

825
01:26:48,083 --> 01:26:51,484
I am nobody! I won't care about you anymore.

826
01:26:51,686 --> 01:26:52,914
Don't you ever come to bother me!

827
01:26:52,954 --> 01:26:56,082
I have nothing...
except a bit self-esteem.

828
01:28:06,494 --> 01:28:07,483
Thirteen.

829
01:28:22,377 --> 01:28:23,309
Washington, she...

830
01:28:23,378 --> 01:28:26,438
She called. No?
Who is it? Princess.

831
01:28:34,990 --> 01:28:36,582
I don't want to play mahjong.

832
01:28:36,791 --> 01:28:37,780
I want to swim.

833
01:28:38,793 --> 01:28:41,853
It's good for the baby.
Let's go.

834
01:28:53,775 --> 01:28:57,267
Washington, come with us.
Washington! Come on!

835
01:29:00,882 --> 01:29:04,943
Help! Elaine is drowning, go save her.

836
01:29:08,923 --> 01:29:09,912
Hurry up!

837
01:29:44,159 --> 01:29:46,593
Don't use your tongue! No wet kisses!

838
01:29:56,304 --> 01:29:57,498
No wet kisses!

839
01:30:02,010 --> 01:30:03,068
How come it's you?

840
01:30:10,618 --> 01:30:11,812
Your father is in trouble.

841
01:30:14,889 --> 01:30:15,856
What is it?

842
01:30:15,924 --> 01:30:19,416
He needs lots of money to save his business.

843
01:30:19,694 --> 01:30:23,152
So, borrow money from the bank!
He has good relationship with the bank!

844
01:30:23,465 --> 01:30:26,866
But the amount is too big, unless,
my family becomes his guarantor.

845
01:30:27,102 --> 01:30:30,071
But my parents want you to marry me.

846
01:30:30,472 --> 01:30:33,441
What?
They hope we will have a lot of babies.

847
01:30:34,008 --> 01:30:35,566
What century are we in!

848
01:31:05,306 --> 01:31:08,400
Come and join us!

849
01:31:08,777 --> 01:31:12,679
It's funny! Come on!
Come over!

850
01:31:34,135 --> 01:31:35,227
Are you still considering?

851
01:31:36,171 --> 01:31:37,160
Shut up!

852
01:31:38,273 --> 01:31:42,437
You have no other choice.
If you don't love me,

853
01:31:42,644 --> 01:31:44,441
for the sake of your father, just
let me pay your living expenses.

854
01:31:46,047 --> 01:31:47,036
Repeat what you've said.

855
01:31:47,982 --> 01:31:49,108
Repeat which part?

856
01:31:53,721 --> 01:31:56,656
I can'tjust leave.

857
01:31:57,659 --> 01:31:59,991
But you should at least go
home to see your father.

858
01:32:01,129 --> 01:32:04,394
I signed a contract with the boss!

859
01:32:04,465 --> 01:32:06,626
It's not difficult to solve.

860
01:32:07,635 --> 01:32:08,602
You don't understand...

861
01:32:10,205 --> 01:32:11,729
Don't say anything wrong.

862
01:32:19,948 --> 01:32:23,475
Mr. Washington, Elaine wants to end the
contract because of a personal reason.

863
01:32:25,019 --> 01:32:26,077
Let her talk to me.

864
01:32:27,155 --> 01:32:28,918
Why did you lose your temper?
I didn't!

865
01:32:30,425 --> 01:32:32,154
If you don't want me to leave,
just say something.

866
01:32:32,760 --> 01:32:35,194
Miss, I don't know what's happening?

867
01:32:36,331 --> 01:32:38,265
I will solve my own problem.

868
01:32:38,466 --> 01:32:40,127
I just want to know whether
you want me to stay or not.

869
01:32:43,838 --> 01:32:44,827
Tell me.

870
01:32:54,582 --> 01:32:55,571
Wait.

871
01:32:57,919 --> 01:33:00,888
It's your call, she is crying badly!

872
01:33:09,364 --> 01:33:10,353
Stop crying!

873
01:33:25,546 --> 01:33:30,347
Stop crying. What is it?

874
01:33:32,387 --> 01:33:33,376
Where are you going?

875
01:33:35,323 --> 01:33:38,224
Why did you answer the phone?
It was none of your business.

876
01:34:08,356 --> 01:34:11,382
Did you ask Washington to call...
he doesn't want me anymore.

877
01:34:12,427 --> 01:34:13,655
You must be better than me.

878
01:34:14,662 --> 01:34:16,459
He's been tortured by me for four years.

879
01:34:17,632 --> 01:34:20,226
In these four years, he hasn't been happy.

880
01:34:22,737 --> 01:34:24,432
Can he forget me?

881
01:34:26,007 --> 01:34:31,946
If you stay with him, I don't mind.

882
01:34:32,880 --> 01:34:34,404
I really don't mind.

883
01:34:36,084 --> 01:34:39,815
You can make him very happy, right?

884
01:34:41,389 --> 01:34:42,378
I...

885
01:34:48,429 --> 01:34:49,828
You can't be like this.

886
01:34:52,700 --> 01:34:53,962
You don't love him at all.

887
01:34:55,770 --> 01:34:57,965
If you love him, you'll not hesitate.

888
01:35:03,711 --> 01:35:04,700
Follow me.

889
01:35:09,150 --> 01:35:11,311
If you don't believe in my
intuition, you can ask it.

890
01:35:14,989 --> 01:35:15,978
Be brave!

891
01:35:19,494 --> 01:35:20,620
Do you love Washington?

892
01:35:23,798 --> 01:35:24,924
You don't love him, do you?

893
01:35:26,100 --> 01:35:29,501
If you don't, please give him back to me.

894
01:35:52,560 --> 01:35:53,686
I love Washington.

895
01:35:59,567 --> 01:36:02,263
Joyce!

896
01:36:05,773 --> 01:36:06,762
Washington.

897
01:36:45,546 --> 01:36:49,073
Don't move, don't touch me.

898
01:36:54,956 --> 01:36:56,583
Put a statue here.

899
01:36:56,757 --> 01:36:59,157
I want to place some umbrellas
along the shore.

900
01:36:59,627 --> 01:37:02,095
Okay, will do it accordingly.

901
01:37:02,630 --> 01:37:04,495
And, right here...

902
01:37:05,299 --> 01:37:06,288
You can't throw it away.

903
01:37:09,837 --> 01:37:11,464
What is it? Let me take a look.

904
01:37:14,242 --> 01:37:15,402
Do you like this painting?

905
01:37:16,110 --> 01:37:17,839
If you don't like it, I'll keep it.

906
01:37:18,713 --> 01:37:21,307
Where do you want to put it? In your heart?

907
01:37:32,960 --> 01:37:35,724
Guess, how old will you live?
Sixty something.

908
01:37:36,130 --> 01:37:38,064
How old are you now?
Twenty five.

909
01:37:39,167 --> 01:37:41,192
Your life is only this long.

910
01:37:41,235 --> 01:37:44,796
You must quickly grasp your opportunity,
you must have self confidence...

911
01:37:49,010 --> 01:37:50,910
Washington, where are you going?

912
01:37:51,979 --> 01:37:53,537
Stay where you are!

913
01:37:55,349 --> 01:37:56,338
Where are you going to?

914
01:37:57,151 --> 01:37:58,140
I am sorry.

915
01:37:58,986 --> 01:38:00,613
Are you going to look for her?
Yes.

916
01:38:01,522 --> 01:38:04,150
You can't leave, I am pregnant.

917
01:38:06,260 --> 01:38:08,751
Impossible! We haven't
done it for half a year.

918
01:38:08,829 --> 01:38:11,821
Yes, but the point isn't who the father is.

919
01:38:13,267 --> 01:38:14,894
Once I know I am pregnant,

920
01:38:15,836 --> 01:38:19,328
I just want you to be the baby's father.

921
01:38:21,108 --> 01:38:24,441
It's so kind of me to marry you,
so, what else do you want?

922
01:38:28,849 --> 01:38:29,838
Washington!

923
01:38:33,854 --> 01:38:34,843
Washington, look!

924
01:38:35,723 --> 01:38:38,385
Remember what you've done?

925
01:38:54,141 --> 01:38:57,304
Washington, stay where you are!

926
01:38:57,712 --> 01:39:00,408
You did so many things to hurt me,
but I'm still willing to marry you,

927
01:39:00,481 --> 01:39:01,413
do you know why?

928
01:39:01,782 --> 01:39:04,148
It's because I always think
you're a loyal man.

929
01:39:05,653 --> 01:39:07,621
I know you'd be loyal to me forever.

930
01:39:09,090 --> 01:39:11,422
You want loyalty? Get a dog!

931
01:39:12,960 --> 01:39:16,088
Washington, stay! You can't leave me!

932
01:39:19,400 --> 01:39:22,335
Yeah... Washington!

933
01:39:45,059 --> 01:39:49,723
Elaine, what's wrong? The
guests have all arrived!

934
01:39:50,598 --> 01:39:52,463
Get yourself ready, come on!

935
01:40:38,746 --> 01:40:39,735
Wait!

936
01:41:18,753 --> 01:41:22,553
Miss Elaine Fang, are you
willing to marry him?

937
01:41:26,627 --> 01:41:27,685
Change your rings, hurry up!

938
01:41:40,674 --> 01:41:42,869
Oh my son! Help! Call an ambulance!

939
01:41:44,245 --> 01:41:47,681
Jojo, why are you here?

940
01:41:48,516 --> 01:41:50,313
Where is Washington? Did he bring you here?

941
01:41:50,584 --> 01:41:52,575
Where is he?

942
01:41:57,091 --> 01:42:03,223
You are late! All the guests have gone.
They all left? That's right.

943
01:43:00,154 --> 01:43:02,452
You'd say sorry!
Really

944
01:43:15,402 --> 01:43:16,801
If you want to get married, marry me.
