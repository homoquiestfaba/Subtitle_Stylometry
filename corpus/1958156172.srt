1
00:01:06,901 --> 00:01:08,335
Ok you know...

2
00:01:08,368 --> 00:01:09,604
I don't think I can do this,
guys.

3
00:01:09,637 --> 00:01:11,238
Well, you know, this is what it
takes.

4
00:01:11,271 --> 00:01:12,306
If you want to be a real
reporter.

5
00:01:12,339 --> 00:01:14,374
You know, I don't feel like much
of a real reporter

6
00:01:14,408 --> 00:01:16,243
Okay, because I get the get up
and everything;

7
00:01:16,276 --> 00:01:17,311
the clothes, the make up,

8
00:01:17,344 --> 00:01:18,713
But why do I have to smell
like fucking garbage?

9
00:01:18,746 --> 00:01:20,548
Hey, it was Suzanne's idea.
So you blend in.

10
00:01:20,782 --> 00:01:22,249
Oh God, what did you spray me
with?

11
00:01:22,282 --> 00:01:23,417
The stuff is awful.

12
00:01:23,450 --> 00:01:24,886
It's called stink water.

13
00:01:24,919 --> 00:01:25,753
Want to know what's in it?

14
00:01:25,787 --> 00:01:27,021
No, I don't wanna know
what's in it.

15
00:01:27,055 --> 00:01:30,457
Hey look, you said you wanted a
story and you got a story, so

16
00:01:30,858 --> 00:01:32,326
don't be a little bitch
about it.

17
00:01:32,359 --> 00:01:33,427
All right.

18
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:34,629
Let me get a mic check here.

19
00:01:34,662 --> 00:01:36,698
Okay, uh check, uh check. One,
two.

20
00:01:36,731 --> 00:01:39,466
If I die tonight, I want you to
know that the guilt is on you.

21
00:01:39,734 --> 00:01:40,902
Uh, you both should know this.

22
00:01:40,935 --> 00:01:43,470
And if I get raped or if I get
murdered or if it's both,

23
00:01:43,705 --> 00:01:45,707
..it's on you and you.

24
00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:46,841
All right. Sounds good?

25
00:01:46,874 --> 00:01:48,042
Yeah. Look, don't worry.

26
00:01:48,076 --> 00:01:50,310
We're going to be there for you
the whole time in the van.

27
00:01:50,344 --> 00:01:52,346
Anything goes wrong,
we got your back.

28
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:53,681
From the van.

29
00:02:16,436 --> 00:02:18,806
Hey, George, why don't you take
a cutout early today, huh?

30
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:20,808
Are you sure I can stick around
and help?

31
00:02:20,842 --> 00:02:21,776
Eh, you just do me a favor,

32
00:02:21,809 --> 00:02:23,511
take out the trash before you
go, alright?

33
00:02:23,544 --> 00:02:24,545
- Okay!
- Yeah.

34
00:02:24,579 --> 00:02:25,546
Thanks Mr. Greco.

35
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:26,547
Yeah, no problem,

36
00:02:26,581 --> 00:02:28,816
Hey, do you think I can buy a
loaf of bread?

37
00:02:28,850 --> 00:02:30,652
I'm going to dinner at my
parents house tonight.

38
00:02:30,685 --> 00:02:31,619
Oh don't even worry. Just
take it.

39
00:02:31,653 --> 00:02:33,220
I'm going to throw it out
anyway. Right?

40
00:02:33,253 --> 00:02:34,221
Okay. Thanks.

41
00:02:34,254 --> 00:02:35,222
Hey, do me a favor.

42
00:02:35,255 --> 00:02:36,758
Say hello to your mom and dad
for me. Alright?

43
00:02:36,791 --> 00:02:37,792
You got it.

44
00:02:37,825 --> 00:02:38,693
Alright. Get your bread.

45
00:02:38,726 --> 00:02:39,694
Thanks, Mr. Greco.

46
00:02:39,727 --> 00:02:40,695
You got it.

47
00:02:41,996 --> 00:02:44,464
What's going on with you guys,
opening your second location?

48
00:02:44,498 --> 00:02:46,567
Which you would be running?

49
00:02:46,901 --> 00:02:49,737
Well, I'm...things are kind
of slow at the shop, Dad,

50
00:02:49,771 --> 00:02:51,506
but I'm working on fixing that.

51
00:02:51,539 --> 00:02:53,273
And then I'll bring it up on
Tuesday. I swear.

52
00:02:53,306 --> 00:02:54,942
Yeah, you better.

53
00:02:54,976 --> 00:02:56,511
You don't want to find yourself

54
00:02:56,544 --> 00:02:58,746
sitting with your thumb up your
ass saying,

55
00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:00,447
"Oh, what the hell
happened?"

56
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,583
- Jesus Christ Marcus.
- Heyyyyy

57
00:03:02,617 --> 00:03:05,753
This from the woman who
I hear walking

58
00:03:05,787 --> 00:03:08,823
around the house screaming,
"Fuckt his and fuck that."

59
00:03:08,856 --> 00:03:10,457
I don't know what you're talking
about.

60
00:03:10,490 --> 00:03:11,626
You don't?

61
00:03:11,659 --> 00:03:13,493
No. I don't. I can't believe
you would

62
00:03:13,528 --> 00:03:17,397
Oh when are you gonna
pull the tit out?
use that language in
front of your son?

63
00:03:17,431 --> 00:03:18,900
He's 28 years old.

64
00:03:18,933 --> 00:03:20,935
George, let me ask you a
question.

65
00:03:20,968 --> 00:03:22,036
Is this the first time

66
00:03:22,070 --> 00:03:25,973
that you have ever heard the
word fuck in your life?

67
00:03:26,007 --> 00:03:26,874
Fuck, no.

68
00:03:26,908 --> 00:03:28,408
Oh, my God!

69
00:03:28,442 --> 00:03:29,677
I'm telling you.

70
00:03:29,877 --> 00:03:32,412
Um, do you think I can
borrow the iron?

71
00:03:32,446 --> 00:03:33,881
My iron?

72
00:03:33,915 --> 00:03:36,283
You want to borrow my iron?

73
00:03:36,316 --> 00:03:38,251
I'm taking Kim out on a
date tonight.

74
00:03:38,285 --> 00:03:40,387
Everything I own is wrinkled
and,

75
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:42,590
No, Dad, I don't. Not yet.

76
00:03:42,790 --> 00:03:46,493
There are a few certain
necessities that every man

77
00:03:46,527 --> 00:03:50,598
must have in his own house. And
an iron is one of them.

78
00:03:51,498 --> 00:03:53,000
I'm taking her out for ice
cream.

79
00:03:53,034 --> 00:03:54,035
And I know, Dad.

80
00:03:54,068 --> 00:03:56,871
I'm working on it. I swear.

81
00:03:56,904 --> 00:03:58,305
Hold on.

82
00:03:58,338 --> 00:04:00,608
I'll grab it for ya.

83
00:04:01,843 --> 00:04:04,746
You um, you remember to go see
your grandfather today?

84
00:04:05,345 --> 00:04:07,048
Yeah, Dad, I do every day.

85
00:04:07,081 --> 00:04:08,716
Good.

86
00:04:09,316 --> 00:04:12,452
He gets lonely ever since your
grandmother passed.

87
00:04:12,486 --> 00:04:13,821
Yeah, I know.

88
00:04:13,855 --> 00:04:14,722
I actually enjoy it.

89
00:04:14,756 --> 00:04:17,290
Here you go, baby.

90
00:04:17,324 --> 00:04:18,159
Aw, thanks Ma.

91
00:04:18,192 --> 00:04:20,027
You sure you don't want to run
home?

92
00:04:20,061 --> 00:04:22,462
Grab your shirt and have Mommy
do it?

93
00:04:22,697 --> 00:04:24,899
No, Mom, I know how to iron a
shirt.

94
00:04:24,932 --> 00:04:27,400
I would hope so.

95
00:04:27,434 --> 00:04:31,471
All right, well, I got to get
going or I'll be late.

96
00:04:31,973 --> 00:04:34,542
But I love you
guys, and dinner was amazing.

97
00:04:35,543 --> 00:04:36,644
Thank you.

98
00:04:37,845 --> 00:04:39,747
I'll see you guys later.

99
00:04:39,781 --> 00:04:42,517
Tell Kim we say hi.

100
00:04:42,550 --> 00:04:44,451
Oh, and be careful.

101
00:04:44,484 --> 00:04:46,621
There's a strangler on the
loose.

102
00:04:46,954 --> 00:04:50,057
And don't forget to bring
back my iron.
Marcus!

103
00:04:50,525 --> 00:04:52,760
What? It's a very good iron.

104
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:55,428
You know what I realized
today?

105
00:04:55,462 --> 00:04:56,496
What's that?

106
00:04:56,531 --> 00:04:59,667
Exactly eight months ago today,
we started dating.

107
00:05:00,935 --> 00:05:02,870
Oh, yeah?

108
00:05:02,904 --> 00:05:03,871
Yep.

109
00:05:03,905 --> 00:05:06,040
Some things you just can't help
but remember.

110
00:05:06,808 --> 00:05:08,543
Happy month-a-versary, girl.

111
00:05:08,576 --> 00:05:09,677
Hmmm.

112
00:05:09,710 --> 00:05:13,514
Eight months ago today, we
became Facebook official.

113
00:05:14,048 --> 00:05:18,085
Yesterday would have been eight
months since you asked me out.

114
00:05:19,821 --> 00:05:21,055
Oh, I got the same reminder.

115
00:05:21,088 --> 00:05:23,456
But a cute try, though, babe.

116
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:26,994
Yeah, but I really did remember
before I went on the Facebook.

117
00:05:27,028 --> 00:05:28,062
George.

118
00:05:29,263 --> 00:05:32,099
Besides, nowadays, what's more
important when it actually

119
00:05:32,133 --> 00:05:33,801
happens or when it goes on the
Facebook?

120
00:05:33,835 --> 00:05:37,104
I am teasing you, George.

121
00:05:43,010 --> 00:05:45,780
Happy month-a-versary baby.

122
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:47,480
I really did remember.

123
00:05:47,515 --> 00:05:48,649
Oh, yeah, I can.

124
00:05:48,683 --> 00:05:50,551
I'm sure you did.

125
00:05:52,954 --> 00:05:55,623
I think I love you, George
Jordan.

126
00:06:01,662 --> 00:06:03,564
Hey, what's it going to be
today, George?

127
00:06:03,598 --> 00:06:04,899
Hey, Lou.

128
00:06:04,932 --> 00:06:06,534
The usual. Thanks.

129
00:06:06,567 --> 00:06:09,136
Coming right up.
Anything for you?

130
00:06:09,170 --> 00:06:10,071
I'm all set. Thanks.

131
00:06:10,571 --> 00:06:11,639
I got to tell you, man,

132
00:06:11,672 --> 00:06:13,975
I don't know how your
grandfather eats this shit.

133
00:06:14,008 --> 00:06:14,876
Yeah. I don't know.

134
00:06:14,909 --> 00:06:16,143
It's weird.

135
00:06:16,177 --> 00:06:18,478
No, I've seen weird stuff.

136
00:06:18,512 --> 00:06:19,647
I believe you.

137
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,949
No, I mean, I've been to Burning
Man.

138
00:06:21,983 --> 00:06:24,085
Like back in the eighties, you
know,

139
00:06:24,118 --> 00:06:26,721
But this sandwich, this
sandwich, I...

140
00:06:28,022 --> 00:06:29,489
I don't know.

141
00:06:30,358 --> 00:06:31,792
Georgie boy? Is
that you?

142
00:06:31,826 --> 00:06:33,928
Hey, Grandpa, I brought you
lunch.

143
00:06:33,961 --> 00:06:37,164
It's your favorite, meatball
parm, banana, peppers and ranch.

144
00:06:37,598 --> 00:06:38,566
Ahhhhh.

145
00:06:38,599 --> 00:06:41,836
Hmm. My son sure raised one hell
of a good kid.

146
00:06:41,869 --> 00:06:43,137
You know that.

147
00:06:43,170 --> 00:06:45,106
Oh thanks, Grandpa.

148
00:06:45,139 --> 00:06:46,674
What are you watching?

149
00:06:46,707 --> 00:06:49,143
It's a documentary about that
Kitty Genovese.

150
00:06:49,911 --> 00:06:51,979
Kitty Genovese? Who's that?

151
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:54,815
Who's Kitty Genovese?

152
00:06:54,849 --> 00:06:57,051
What the hell do they teach ya
in those schools?

153
00:06:57,551 --> 00:06:59,887
No wonder you kids need
kneepads to take a shit.

154
00:06:59,921 --> 00:07:02,690
She's this broad who got
butchered in front of all of

155
00:07:02,723 --> 00:07:05,693
her neighbors, who did nothing.
The sons of bitches.

156
00:07:05,726 --> 00:07:08,696
They should have been brought
out back and put down. Pow.

157
00:07:08,729 --> 00:07:09,864
I can't believe that. How could

158
00:07:09,897 --> 00:07:11,532
someone just stand around
and watch?

159
00:07:11,565 --> 00:07:14,802
Well, that's cause you got my
blood pumping through you.

160
00:07:15,236 --> 00:07:18,039
We Jordans are built strong and
tough.

161
00:07:18,072 --> 00:07:19,540
- Yeah. Don't I know it?
- Yeah.

162
00:07:22,209 --> 00:07:23,945
Well, Grandpa, I gotta get
going.

163
00:07:23,978 --> 00:07:25,246
Kim's making me dinner tonight.

164
00:07:25,279 --> 00:07:26,213
Oh, What's she making?

165
00:07:26,914 --> 00:07:28,916
I'm not sure,
but she said she's making a lot.

166
00:07:29,150 --> 00:07:30,551
Are you bringing something?

167
00:07:30,584 --> 00:07:31,919
No.

168
00:07:32,119 --> 00:07:34,755
You should never show up for
dinner empty handed.

169
00:07:35,156 --> 00:07:37,591
Grab some wine. It's an easy
fix.

170
00:07:37,625 --> 00:07:38,893
- Okay.
- Yeah.

171
00:07:39,126 --> 00:07:40,828
All right. I think I'll do
that, Grandpa.

172
00:07:40,861 --> 00:07:41,896
- Okay.
- Thanks.

173
00:07:42,730 --> 00:07:45,032
Sons of bitches. Pow!

174
00:07:52,773 --> 00:07:56,077
What are you doing!?
- please stop! Stop!

175
00:07:56,110 --> 00:07:58,079
Someone help me!

176
00:07:58,112 --> 00:08:00,548
What are you doing?! Oh my god!

177
00:08:00,581 --> 00:08:02,183
Don't touch me!

178
00:08:02,216 --> 00:08:03,918
I'm gonna make you mine bitch!

179
00:08:03,951 --> 00:08:05,119
I'm gonna make sure
nobody wants to

180
00:08:05,152 --> 00:08:06,187
- Hey!
- Look at you again.

181
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:07,221
Hey! Hey, mister.

182
00:08:07,254 --> 00:08:08,589
What are you doing?

183
00:08:08,622 --> 00:08:10,925
Shut the fuck up and mind your
own.

184
00:08:10,958 --> 00:08:13,761
What? Whatcha going to do
about it, huh?

185
00:08:13,794 --> 00:08:17,198
See now I'm a fuck her up,
then I'm a fuck you up.

186
00:08:17,231 --> 00:08:18,933
Jail style.

187
00:08:18,966 --> 00:08:20,034
What you gonna do about it? Huh?

188
00:08:20,067 --> 00:08:21,068
I'm...

189
00:08:21,102 --> 00:08:22,737
That's what I thought

190
00:08:23,070 --> 00:08:24,171
What's that?

191
00:08:24,572 --> 00:08:27,008
That's wine? That's Pinot
Grigio?

192
00:08:27,675 --> 00:08:28,876
Actually, Yeah.

193
00:08:28,909 --> 00:08:31,579
I fucking love Pinot Grigio.

194
00:08:31,612 --> 00:08:33,247
Give me that Pinot Grigio.
C'mon.

195
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:34,548
Okay.

196
00:08:36,717 --> 00:08:40,221
And those. What size is that?
That's a size 12?

197
00:08:40,254 --> 00:08:41,756
It better be a size 12.

198
00:08:41,789 --> 00:08:44,091
Jesus Christ. How would you know
that? What the--

199
00:08:44,125 --> 00:08:45,860
They probably fucking look
better on you anyway.

200
00:08:45,893 --> 00:08:48,029
Just please let her go. Please.

201
00:08:48,062 --> 00:08:49,230
Good. Good.

202
00:08:49,263 --> 00:08:52,299
Just one more thing.

203
00:08:54,869 --> 00:08:56,137
- Got ya!
- Got ya!

204
00:08:58,773 --> 00:08:59,774
Oh, my God.

205
00:08:59,807 --> 00:09:01,008
- That was so good.
- ...Perfect

206
00:09:01,042 --> 00:09:01,976
That was great.

207
00:09:02,009 --> 00:09:03,344
Hey man, sorry to scare you like
that we're--

208
00:09:03,377 --> 00:09:04,845
we're doing a social
experiment.

209
00:09:04,879 --> 00:09:06,781
It's. Yeah, it's all right. It's
not real.

210
00:09:06,814 --> 00:09:08,582
Are you fucking kidding me?

211
00:09:08,616 --> 00:09:10,051
What the hell was that?

212
00:09:10,084 --> 00:09:13,054
That, that, that wasn't funny,
like, at all.

213
00:09:13,354 --> 00:09:15,589
It's called acting. I'm an
actor.

214
00:09:15,623 --> 00:09:17,625
My name is Chad.

215
00:09:17,958 --> 00:09:20,027
Oh hey, we're just going to need
you to sign right here.

216
00:09:20,061 --> 00:09:21,996
That would be great.
Right here, use
my back.

217
00:09:22,029 --> 00:09:23,864
By the way, that was phenomenal
job, guys.

218
00:09:23,898 --> 00:09:25,599
Oh, my gosh. I felt it that
time.

219
00:09:26,634 --> 00:09:28,002
Look at his tears!

220
00:09:30,071 --> 00:09:31,038
Enjoy your wine too, yeah!

221
00:09:31,072 --> 00:09:34,008
Oh, oh, by the way, I actually
do love wine.

222
00:09:34,041 --> 00:09:35,309
Oh you love Pinot Grigio!

223
00:09:35,342 --> 00:09:36,577
That part wasn't acting.

224
00:09:36,610 --> 00:09:39,747
He knows his smokey wines and
the, you know, the sweet wines.

225
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:41,949
Chad is the one
to take to a wine bar.
Yeah, yeah.

226
00:09:41,982 --> 00:09:44,218
Oh yes. Speaking of wine bars,
should we go to one?

227
00:09:44,251 --> 00:09:45,653
Oh! Let's get some
tapas. Tapas?
Uh...probably
have enough time.

228
00:09:45,686 --> 00:09:47,154
Anyway. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

229
00:09:47,188 --> 00:09:48,389
Have a good night you
guys.

230
00:09:48,422 --> 00:09:50,791
What the hell was that?

231
00:09:50,825 --> 00:09:51,892
Oh! Oh!

232
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:54,228
Hello!?

233
00:09:58,966 --> 00:10:00,367
Hey, baby.

234
00:10:00,801 --> 00:10:02,369
I got you a bottle of wine.

235
00:10:02,403 --> 00:10:04,105
I hope you like it.

236
00:10:04,438 --> 00:10:07,208
You wouldn't believe what
happened to me today.

237
00:10:09,310 --> 00:10:11,846
Okay. Is something wrong?

238
00:10:11,879 --> 00:10:14,715
Yeah, I guess you could say
that.

239
00:10:15,749 --> 00:10:16,784
Well what is it?

240
00:10:16,817 --> 00:10:19,253
I think you know what it is.

241
00:10:19,286 --> 00:10:20,221
Babe.

242
00:10:21,055 --> 00:10:23,991
Come on, tell me what's going
on.

243
00:10:24,024 --> 00:10:25,659
Give me a hint.

244
00:10:25,693 --> 00:10:26,727
Hmm.

245
00:10:39,974 --> 00:10:42,910
Hey, Mister. What are you doing?

246
00:10:42,943 --> 00:10:45,646
Shut the fuck up and mind your
own. What?

247
00:10:46,113 --> 00:10:47,348
What's gonna do about it, huh?

248
00:10:47,381 --> 00:10:49,917
I'm not gonna do anything.

249
00:10:49,950 --> 00:10:52,686
What's that? That's wine? that's
Pinot Grigio?

250
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:53,787
Give me that Pinot Grigio.

251
00:10:53,821 --> 00:10:54,788
Okay.

252
00:10:58,058 --> 00:10:59,093
Here, take them.

253
00:10:59,126 --> 00:11:00,794
They probably fucking look
better on you anyway.

254
00:11:00,828 --> 00:11:02,096
Just please don't hurt me.

255
00:11:02,129 --> 00:11:03,297
I'll do anything you want.

256
00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:07,168
I swear.

257
00:11:09,904 --> 00:11:11,839
What the fuck?
That literally just happened.

258
00:11:11,872 --> 00:11:13,174
But that's not what happened.

259
00:11:13,207 --> 00:11:15,176
How does that have so many hits?

260
00:11:15,209 --> 00:11:17,344
Over a million hits, George.

261
00:11:18,245 --> 00:11:19,713
It's trending on Twitter,

262
00:11:19,747 --> 00:11:22,917
and somebody's already made a
rap remix to it.

263
00:11:22,950 --> 00:11:25,252
Do you know what that means?

264
00:11:25,286 --> 00:11:28,355
That means that over a million
people already know

265
00:11:28,389 --> 00:11:31,392
that my ex-boyfriend is the
biggest pussy on the Internet.

266
00:11:32,193 --> 00:11:34,195
Babe. It wasn't real.
It was a prank.

267
00:11:34,228 --> 00:11:37,798
Don't call me babe.

268
00:11:37,831 --> 00:11:39,900
How could you just stand there?

269
00:11:39,934 --> 00:11:42,469
I mean what if, what if that was
me? What would you have done?

270
00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:44,805
I don't know what to say,
but it wasn't a real.

271
00:11:44,838 --> 00:11:46,106
They doctored the tape.

272
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:47,241
No! Shh-shh.

273
00:11:48,242 --> 00:11:50,077
Just stop talking.

274
00:11:50,344 --> 00:11:52,012
Get out of my apartment.

275
00:11:52,046 --> 00:11:53,881
I don't ever want to see you
again. Is that understood?

276
00:11:54,915 --> 00:11:56,083
I love you.

277
00:11:56,116 --> 00:11:58,786
Well, I don't love you. Not
anymore.

278
00:11:59,186 --> 00:12:02,256
Oh, and by the way, I should let
you know I took the liberty

279
00:12:02,289 --> 00:12:03,490
of going on your Facebook page

280
00:12:03,525 --> 00:12:05,960
and changing your
relationship status.

281
00:12:05,993 --> 00:12:06,961
You did what?

282
00:12:06,994 --> 00:12:09,263
I changed it to single,
and I blocked myself.

283
00:12:09,463 --> 00:12:12,233
I am not going down with you,
George.

284
00:12:12,266 --> 00:12:14,502
I have a life,
and it's going to stay that way.

285
00:12:14,536 --> 00:12:16,770
Now leave, before someone gets
the wrong idea.

286
00:12:16,804 --> 00:12:19,507
Bye!

287
00:12:21,308 --> 00:12:23,177
This is a fucking guy.

288
00:12:23,210 --> 00:12:25,346
Oh, please. Somebody help me.

289
00:12:25,379 --> 00:12:26,981
It wasn't real. It was a prank.

290
00:12:27,014 --> 00:12:28,349
What the hell's wrong with
you people?

291
00:12:28,382 --> 00:12:30,784
Fuck you, you Pinot Grigio
bitch.

292
00:12:31,085 --> 00:12:32,152
Yeah. Fuck you!

293
00:12:32,419 --> 00:12:33,354
You won't do shit.

294
00:12:33,387 --> 00:12:35,389
George, I swear to God,
if you don't leave,

295
00:12:35,422 --> 00:12:36,223
I'm going to call the cops.

296
00:12:36,257 --> 00:12:38,926
Okay? Okay. I'm leaving. I'm
sorry.

297
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:41,495
It was a fucking prank!

298
00:12:44,064 --> 00:12:46,867
This week's video breakdown just
came in and it was a doozy.

299
00:12:47,101 --> 00:12:48,802
Let's put 30 seconds on the
clock and watch

300
00:12:48,836 --> 00:12:51,506
George Jordan become my new
personal favorite hero.

301
00:12:52,006 --> 00:12:54,174
Hey, mister, What are you doing?

302
00:12:54,208 --> 00:12:56,844
Shut the fuck up and mind your
own.

303
00:12:56,877 --> 00:12:58,479
What? What you going to do about
it, huh?

304
00:12:58,513 --> 00:13:01,181
I'll do anything you want. I
swear.

305
00:13:02,149 --> 00:13:04,952
Oh, crap.

306
00:13:07,354 --> 00:13:10,090
Oh shit honey. George is here.

307
00:13:10,124 --> 00:13:11,325
What do we do?

308
00:13:11,358 --> 00:13:13,927
T-t-t-turn out the lights. Don't
say anything.

309
00:13:13,961 --> 00:13:15,396
Is the door locked?

310
00:13:15,429 --> 00:13:16,463
It is now.

311
00:13:16,497 --> 00:13:17,498
Lights. Lights.

312
00:13:17,532 --> 00:13:19,333
Get the lights.

313
00:13:23,170 --> 00:13:24,171
Shit!

314
00:13:24,204 --> 00:13:25,372
Shush!

315
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:26,907
Oh, fuck.

316
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:28,610
He's got a key.

317
00:13:28,643 --> 00:13:32,846
What the fuck? They change the
locks?

318
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:34,415
Hello?

319
00:13:34,448 --> 00:13:37,117
Mom, Dad, this isn't fucking
funny.

320
00:13:37,151 --> 00:13:39,153
I'm having, like,
the worst day of my life.

321
00:13:39,186 --> 00:13:40,154
We know!

322
00:13:40,187 --> 00:13:41,422
We saw the video!

323
00:13:42,256 --> 00:13:46,260
I got to tell you, George,
we are not too proud

324
00:13:46,293 --> 00:13:48,162
right about now.

325
00:14:05,647 --> 00:14:08,182
Aye-yo, this next cat
is something else.

326
00:14:08,215 --> 00:14:10,084
You feel me, dog? All right.
This dude.

327
00:14:10,117 --> 00:14:12,152
When Danger comes, he shoulda
just started a-runnin.

328
00:14:12,186 --> 00:14:13,187
You know what I'm saying?

329
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:15,356
Instead, he just stays there
pooping his pants.

330
00:14:15,623 --> 00:14:17,625
Plus, his face looks like an
aborted fetus.

331
00:14:17,659 --> 00:14:19,093
All right, check it out, y'all.

332
00:14:19,126 --> 00:14:21,328
Hey, mister, What are you doing?

333
00:14:21,362 --> 00:14:24,031
Shut the fuck up and mind your
own. What?

334
00:14:24,532 --> 00:14:25,966
What's going to do about it,
huh?

335
00:14:31,271 --> 00:14:32,906
Gimme that Pinot Grigio!

336
00:14:48,690 --> 00:14:52,126
Dude. Have you been on Facebook?
You're, like, famous.

337
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:54,194
And I don't mean the good kind.
I mean, like, the bad kind.

338
00:14:55,129 --> 00:14:56,531
And there's a word for it.

339
00:14:56,564 --> 00:14:58,265
Man, this guy's infamous. Yeah,
that's it.

340
00:14:58,298 --> 00:14:59,567
Yeah that's it! That's the word.

341
00:14:59,601 --> 00:15:01,503
It's fucking everywhere.

342
00:15:01,536 --> 00:15:02,637
I-I don't know what to do.

343
00:15:02,670 --> 00:15:04,572
I can't get on the Facebook.

344
00:15:04,606 --> 00:15:07,941
I-I think Kim change all my
passwords.

345
00:15:07,975 --> 00:15:09,209
Dude.

346
00:15:10,077 --> 00:15:11,211
You're not kidding.

347
00:15:11,245 --> 00:15:12,479
What happened?

348
00:15:12,514 --> 00:15:14,248
What do you mean, what happened?

349
00:15:14,281 --> 00:15:15,983
The tape was doctored.

350
00:15:16,016 --> 00:15:17,451
It was a prank.

351
00:15:17,484 --> 00:15:18,586
And?

352
00:15:19,153 --> 00:15:20,053
And what?

353
00:15:20,087 --> 00:15:21,589
I-I didn't know what to do.
I panicked.

354
00:15:21,623 --> 00:15:23,357
I thought I was next.

355
00:15:23,390 --> 00:15:25,259
Next for what? Like the rape?

356
00:15:25,292 --> 00:15:26,393
Yeah.

357
00:15:26,427 --> 00:15:27,428
Scary.

358
00:15:27,461 --> 00:15:29,496
It happened so fast.

359
00:15:29,531 --> 00:15:31,098
I panicked.

360
00:15:31,131 --> 00:15:33,568
And the next thing I know,
5 seconds later,

361
00:15:33,601 --> 00:15:35,135
the video is everywhere.

362
00:15:37,337 --> 00:15:38,606
What are you going to do?

363
00:15:39,206 --> 00:15:40,274
I don't know.

364
00:15:40,642 --> 00:15:43,076
You think I can get them to take
it down?

365
00:15:43,444 --> 00:15:45,212
No fucking way, dude.

366
00:15:45,245 --> 00:15:46,346
That tape's in so many places,

367
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:48,348
it'd be impossible to
take it down.

368
00:15:48,382 --> 00:15:51,118
So then what?

369
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:52,620
I don't know.

370
00:15:53,521 --> 00:15:54,656
But.

371
00:15:55,155 --> 00:15:56,591
Shhhhh.

372
00:15:57,592 --> 00:15:58,760
There's that.

373
00:15:58,793 --> 00:16:00,194
What is this?

374
00:16:00,227 --> 00:16:01,729
It's a list of pay phone
addresses?

375
00:16:01,763 --> 00:16:04,131
Yeah. Why the hell do you have
this?

376
00:16:04,164 --> 00:16:07,334
I saved every number as a
different alias in my phone.

377
00:16:07,367 --> 00:16:09,102
Okay, so if you need to get a
hold of me,

378
00:16:09,136 --> 00:16:10,304
That's how you're
going to do it.

379
00:16:11,606 --> 00:16:14,174
At least until this shit blows
over.

380
00:16:14,408 --> 00:16:16,210
If, it blows over.

381
00:16:16,243 --> 00:16:17,211
Wait, you're kidding me?

382
00:16:17,244 --> 00:16:19,046
What do you think they have my
phones tapped?

383
00:16:19,079 --> 00:16:22,082
It's the Facebook. Okay?
They know everything.

384
00:16:22,115 --> 00:16:23,618
I got to go. Okay.

385
00:16:23,651 --> 00:16:25,118
If you need to get a hold of me.

386
00:16:25,152 --> 00:16:27,354
Use one of those numbers. Ask
for Kevin.

387
00:16:27,387 --> 00:16:30,157
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,
wait.

388
00:16:30,658 --> 00:16:32,226
So who's Kevin?

389
00:16:32,259 --> 00:16:34,696
Are you Kevin or my Kevin?

390
00:16:34,729 --> 00:16:36,196
No one's Kevin.

391
00:16:37,264 --> 00:16:39,132
Why am I asking for Kevin?

392
00:16:39,166 --> 00:16:41,703
Just remember, ask for Kevin.

393
00:16:41,736 --> 00:16:42,737
Oh, fuck Kevin!

394
00:16:43,671 --> 00:16:45,005
Um, who's Kevin?

395
00:16:46,173 --> 00:16:48,610
No one's Kevin.

396
00:16:50,578 --> 00:16:52,112
Oh what do you want now?

397
00:16:52,145 --> 00:16:54,047
What do you want, Kevin?

398
00:16:54,348 --> 00:16:55,517
Who's Kevin?

399
00:16:57,384 --> 00:16:59,654
Are you George Jordan?

400
00:16:59,687 --> 00:17:00,688
I, I...

401
00:17:00,722 --> 00:17:02,322
I might be.

402
00:17:02,356 --> 00:17:05,259
Okay. I'm Suzanne Winners from
Channel 12 News.

403
00:17:05,693 --> 00:17:07,629
You are George Jordan.

404
00:17:08,563 --> 00:17:09,463
I am.

405
00:17:09,697 --> 00:17:12,199
Yeah. You are.

406
00:17:14,334 --> 00:17:17,639
Can I get you something?
Tea? Coffee?

407
00:17:17,672 --> 00:17:23,343
Oh, tea would be great.
Thank you.

408
00:17:23,377 --> 00:17:24,679
I assume you're here because
of the

409
00:17:24,712 --> 00:17:26,480
doctored video on the
Internet of me.

410
00:17:26,514 --> 00:17:27,749
We at Channel 12 News

411
00:17:27,782 --> 00:17:30,785
want to give you an opportunity
to tell your side of the story.

412
00:17:31,251 --> 00:17:33,821
Now, would you be free to come
into the studio tomorrow

413
00:17:33,855 --> 00:17:35,757
to do an interview to
plead your case?

414
00:17:35,790 --> 00:17:37,825
Wait, you actually believe me?

415
00:17:38,392 --> 00:17:39,761
Oh, all right.

416
00:17:39,794 --> 00:17:42,296
Be at the news station tomorrow
at six for make up.

417
00:17:42,329 --> 00:17:43,497
Okay.

418
00:17:43,531 --> 00:17:46,133
And here are directions to the
news station and a list of

419
00:17:46,166 --> 00:17:48,670
questions that you should be
prepared to answer.

420
00:17:48,703 --> 00:17:50,705
I'll be there. Thank you.

421
00:17:52,807 --> 00:17:54,809
Would you like honey in your
tea?

422
00:17:54,842 --> 00:17:56,310
Oh, no, thank you.

423
00:17:56,343 --> 00:17:57,812
Looking forward to seeing you
tomorrow.

424
00:17:57,845 --> 00:17:59,479
Oh, and, George, one more thing.

425
00:17:59,514 --> 00:18:00,515
Yeah?

426
00:18:00,548 --> 00:18:02,115
Your balls are out.

427
00:18:02,149 --> 00:18:03,150
Oh fuck.

428
00:18:03,183 --> 00:18:04,184
No, wait.

429
00:18:04,217 --> 00:18:05,185
Sorry.

430
00:18:05,218 --> 00:18:06,353
Fuck.

431
00:18:06,386 --> 00:18:07,454
Shit.

432
00:18:16,363 --> 00:18:17,532
Are you ready, George?

433
00:18:17,565 --> 00:18:18,866
Yeah, I think so.

434
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:20,602
Hmm. Just be yourself.

435
00:18:20,635 --> 00:18:22,269
You'll be fine.

436
00:18:22,302 --> 00:18:23,370
Mhmm.

437
00:18:31,445 --> 00:18:33,748
Bla la la la la la la la.

438
00:18:34,849 --> 00:18:36,584
Ca-ca

439
00:18:36,618 --> 00:18:38,385
That's it.

440
00:18:41,288 --> 00:18:44,358
Hi, I'm Suzanne Winners today on
Channel 12 News.

441
00:18:44,391 --> 00:18:47,528
We have none other than the
infamous YouTube sensation

442
00:18:47,562 --> 00:18:48,896
George Jordan.

443
00:18:48,930 --> 00:18:52,332
Some of you may know him better
as "The Crying Guy"

444
00:18:52,366 --> 00:18:56,403
or "The Do Nothing Guy" or even
"Cold Foot".

445
00:18:56,436 --> 00:18:57,605
"Cold Foot"?

446
00:18:57,639 --> 00:19:01,274
George, in your own words,
can you tell us what happened

447
00:19:01,308 --> 00:19:05,312
that night? A night the world
may never forget. Ever.

448
00:19:05,813 --> 00:19:07,447
I uh,
- Ever.

449
00:19:07,481 --> 00:19:08,883
Well, first off,

450
00:19:08,916 --> 00:19:11,318
the night you're talking about
was last night.

451
00:19:11,351 --> 00:19:13,286
Are you avoiding the question,
George?

452
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:15,489
No, I'm just letting everyone
know

453
00:19:15,890 --> 00:19:18,325
that it hasn't even been a week
since this happened.

454
00:19:18,726 --> 00:19:20,662
What happened that night,
George?

455
00:19:20,695 --> 00:19:22,496
Well, I was leaving the
liquor store

456
00:19:22,530 --> 00:19:24,899
when I heard a horrible,
shrill scream.

457
00:19:24,932 --> 00:19:26,500
The victim
- The actor.

458
00:19:26,534 --> 00:19:27,502
It wasn't real.

459
00:19:27,535 --> 00:19:30,303
Hmm. Well, it looked pretty real
to me, George.

460
00:19:30,505 --> 00:19:33,373
Why would anyone make light of
such an atrocity?

461
00:19:33,608 --> 00:19:35,242
I don't know. For the hits?

462
00:19:36,010 --> 00:19:38,345
They said it was a social
experiment.

463
00:19:38,378 --> 00:19:41,214
Well, the assailant in the video
was African-American.

464
00:19:41,248 --> 00:19:43,417
Did this play a factor in your
reaction?

465
00:19:43,450 --> 00:19:45,720
No, it's not like I hate black
people.

466
00:19:46,453 --> 00:19:48,890
It it was a joke.
I was going along with it.

467
00:19:48,923 --> 00:19:51,425
So you're saying you think rape
is a joke?

468
00:19:51,458 --> 00:19:52,727
Do I think rape is a joke?

469
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:54,562
No, I think it's an epidemic

470
00:19:54,595 --> 00:19:56,831
that's been plaguing the country
for way too long.

471
00:19:56,864 --> 00:19:59,466
Supposing your story is true,

472
00:19:59,801 --> 00:20:02,637
what did you think of your
acting performance?

473
00:20:02,670 --> 00:20:05,405
I think it was okay,
but I could do better.

474
00:20:06,373 --> 00:20:08,375
Where were you going with that
bottle of wine, George?

475
00:20:08,408 --> 00:20:10,611
Well I-
Do I have a drinking
problem?

476
00:20:10,978 --> 00:20:12,880
Do I have a drinking problem?
No!

477
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:16,450
I was going to my girlfriends,
for dinner,

478
00:20:16,483 --> 00:20:18,452
and I didn't want to show up
empty handed.

479
00:20:18,485 --> 00:20:20,353
What's your girlfriend's name?

480
00:20:20,387 --> 00:20:21,488
Kim.

481
00:20:21,522 --> 00:20:22,724
But she has nothing to do with
this.

482
00:20:22,757 --> 00:20:25,292
What did Kim say about you
showing up

483
00:20:25,325 --> 00:20:28,563
without the wine and without
your shoes?

484
00:20:28,596 --> 00:20:30,497
Well, she didn't say anything
because

485
00:20:30,531 --> 00:20:32,800
I showed up in my shoes with
the wine.

486
00:20:32,834 --> 00:20:34,736
Do you care about Kim?

487
00:20:34,769 --> 00:20:36,838
Yes! I love Kim.

488
00:20:36,871 --> 00:20:39,306
I would do anything for Kim.

489
00:20:39,339 --> 00:20:41,509
Well, what if it was Kim being
attacked

490
00:20:41,542 --> 00:20:44,612
instead of this poor girl
who is presumably dead?

491
00:20:44,912 --> 00:20:46,881
Would you have done anything
differently then?

492
00:20:46,914 --> 00:20:48,049
I would've done a lot.

493
00:20:48,082 --> 00:20:50,350
But that's not the point.
The whole thing was staged.

494
00:20:50,383 --> 00:20:51,519
It was fake.

495
00:20:51,552 --> 00:20:53,286
Why don't you people get that?

496
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:54,589
If this was fake,

497
00:20:54,622 --> 00:20:57,424
why would you put your signature
on a release form

498
00:20:57,457 --> 00:21:00,595
for a video that clearly makes
you out to be a horrible person?

499
00:21:01,896 --> 00:21:03,998
Well, honestly, she
asked for it,

500
00:21:05,332 --> 00:21:06,934
and I wasn't paying attention.

501
00:21:06,968 --> 00:21:09,302
And why hasn't anyone brought
the fact that there was

502
00:21:09,336 --> 00:21:12,840
a guy filming it and why he
didn't do anything?

503
00:21:12,874 --> 00:21:15,643
Wow.

504
00:21:15,676 --> 00:21:17,044
Well, there you have it.

505
00:21:17,078 --> 00:21:19,614
George Jordan says the video
is fake,

506
00:21:19,647 --> 00:21:21,916
and he's got the shoes to
prove it.

507
00:21:21,949 --> 00:21:24,652
When we come back, our very own
James McAuliff

508
00:21:24,685 --> 00:21:26,486
has been undercover as a
homeless man

509
00:21:26,521 --> 00:21:29,090
wandering the valley in search
of the notorious,

510
00:21:29,123 --> 00:21:31,793
Van Nuys Vagrant Strangler.

511
00:21:32,093 --> 00:21:33,393
- Cut.
- That's a cut.

512
00:21:33,928 --> 00:21:34,896
Okay.

513
00:21:34,929 --> 00:21:36,597
What the hell was that?

514
00:21:36,631 --> 00:21:38,900
Oh, nothing. You did great.
Don't worry about it.

515
00:21:38,933 --> 00:21:41,334
Don't forget to pick up your
complimentary

516
00:21:41,368 --> 00:21:42,937
Channel 12 news
hat on the way out.

517
00:21:43,805 --> 00:21:47,074
Do you think that's going to
work?

518
00:21:47,542 --> 00:21:48,810
Tonight at five.

519
00:21:48,843 --> 00:21:52,312
When this airs,
your life is going to change.

520
00:21:53,948 --> 00:21:54,949
Hmm.

521
00:21:54,982 --> 00:21:55,983
Thank you.

522
00:21:56,017 --> 00:21:57,417
Mhmm. Ahhhhh!

523
00:21:57,450 --> 00:21:58,252
Sweaty hands.

524
00:21:58,286 --> 00:22:00,755
Sweaty hands. Why your hands
sweaty?

525
00:22:00,788 --> 00:22:02,489
It only happens when I get
nervous.

526
00:22:02,523 --> 00:22:04,025
It's gross.

527
00:22:04,926 --> 00:22:06,459
Makeup!

528
00:22:06,794 --> 00:22:09,630
And that brings the death toll
now to 14.

529
00:22:09,997 --> 00:22:11,732
Back to you, Suzanne.

530
00:22:11,766 --> 00:22:13,835
And cut.

531
00:22:13,868 --> 00:22:14,802
Hey, guys.

532
00:22:14,836 --> 00:22:15,870
I don't know how much longer I
can do this.

533
00:22:15,903 --> 00:22:18,506
Man, I mean, I feel like any day
now I'll be next.

534
00:22:19,472 --> 00:22:21,776
Yeah, I think that's uh,
kind of the point buddy.

535
00:22:22,409 --> 00:22:24,512
Hey, but like I said, don't
worry.

536
00:22:25,079 --> 00:22:27,048
We're going to be there for you.

537
00:22:27,081 --> 00:22:28,783
From the van.

538
00:22:28,816 --> 00:22:30,818
Good luck, buddy.

539
00:22:38,826 --> 00:22:39,894
He's dead.

540
00:22:43,764 --> 00:22:44,699
Oh.

541
00:22:47,668 --> 00:22:49,103
Good to go.

542
00:22:54,976 --> 00:22:56,878
What the fuck are you doing
here?

543
00:22:56,911 --> 00:22:57,945
Let me explain.

544
00:22:57,979 --> 00:22:58,946
Explain what?

545
00:22:58,980 --> 00:23:01,182
I told you, I never wanted to
see you again.

546
00:23:01,215 --> 00:23:02,884
There's nothing to explain here.

547
00:23:02,917 --> 00:23:04,151
I know, but.

548
00:23:04,185 --> 00:23:08,388
But just do me a favor and watch
Channel 12 News tonight, please.

549
00:23:08,756 --> 00:23:11,025
The local news channel.

550
00:23:11,491 --> 00:23:13,694
Why would I watch that?

551
00:23:15,830 --> 00:23:16,898
Sir, I'm gonna have to

552
00:23:16,931 --> 00:23:19,934
ask you to vacate the premises.

553
00:23:19,967 --> 00:23:23,070
Please. For me, it will explain
everything.

554
00:23:23,104 --> 00:23:24,404
Sir.

555
00:23:24,972 --> 00:23:27,407
I will call the authorities.

556
00:23:27,675 --> 00:23:29,510
Hey, is everything okay over
there?

557
00:23:29,543 --> 00:23:31,746
Yeah, it's fine, thanks.

558
00:23:31,779 --> 00:23:34,916
Can you just please watch
the news at five?

559
00:23:35,482 --> 00:23:36,483
Please

560
00:23:36,517 --> 00:23:37,752
Uh, miss?

561
00:23:37,952 --> 00:23:39,553
Hi.

562
00:23:39,754 --> 00:23:40,888
Hi, um.

563
00:23:40,922 --> 00:23:42,657
Is this boy?

564
00:23:42,690 --> 00:23:44,058
Is he bothering you?

565
00:23:44,091 --> 00:23:45,960
- No!
- Yes!

566
00:23:46,827 --> 00:23:49,997
Hey, aren't you cold foot?

567
00:23:50,031 --> 00:23:52,867
No! Who the fuck is this cold
foot guy?

568
00:23:52,900 --> 00:23:54,168
No, I'm not George Jordon.

569
00:23:54,201 --> 00:23:55,202
Hmm.

570
00:23:55,236 --> 00:23:58,506
Well uh, whoever the fuck
you are,

571
00:23:58,539 --> 00:24:00,508
I suggest you get the fuck
out of here

572
00:24:00,541 --> 00:24:03,544
before something really bad
happens to you. Okay?

573
00:24:09,050 --> 00:24:11,652
Okay. I'm leaving. You happy?

574
00:24:11,686 --> 00:24:14,487
Just please watch.

575
00:24:15,756 --> 00:24:16,824
Next.

576
00:24:16,857 --> 00:24:20,227
Can I get a meatball
parm, banana, peppers and ranch?

577
00:24:21,028 --> 00:24:22,730
Oh, shit. George, is that you?

578
00:24:22,763 --> 00:24:23,965
I don't know what you're talking
about.

579
00:24:23,998 --> 00:24:24,865
I'm in a rush.

580
00:24:24,899 --> 00:24:26,033
Holy shit, it is you!

581
00:24:26,067 --> 00:24:27,868
Aye guys. George is here.

582
00:24:27,902 --> 00:24:28,869
It's not me!

583
00:24:28,903 --> 00:24:30,071
Of course it's you.

584
00:24:30,104 --> 00:24:32,073
You're the only person who
orders that weird ass sandwich.

585
00:24:32,106 --> 00:24:33,975
Hey, it's the crying guy.

586
00:24:34,008 --> 00:24:35,109
Can I get a picture?

587
00:24:35,142 --> 00:24:36,043
No! You fucking may not!

588
00:24:41,816 --> 00:24:43,217
Next.

589
00:24:45,686 --> 00:24:47,054
Hey, Grandpa.

590
00:24:47,088 --> 00:24:48,055
Hello?

591
00:24:49,123 --> 00:24:50,024
Couldn't get your sandwich
today.

592
00:24:50,057 --> 00:24:51,592
There's something going on at
the Deli.

593
00:24:51,625 --> 00:24:53,194
But I hope you like a burger.

594
00:24:54,729 --> 00:24:55,930
Is that you? Yeah.

595
00:24:55,963 --> 00:24:57,765
Come on back. I can use a hand.

596
00:24:58,332 --> 00:25:01,202
in front of all of her
neighbors.

597
00:25:01,702 --> 00:25:04,605
Who did nothing.

598
00:25:04,638 --> 00:25:06,941
Those sons of bitches.

599
00:25:06,974 --> 00:25:10,177
Should have been brought out
back and put down.

600
00:25:10,211 --> 00:25:12,179
Pow!

601
00:25:13,581 --> 00:25:16,684
George, I can't get my Youtubes
to work.

602
00:25:17,351 --> 00:25:18,953
Can you help me?

603
00:25:19,353 --> 00:25:22,656
And I got this damn rabbits
eaten up all my tomatoes.

604
00:25:23,624 --> 00:25:24,592
George?

605
00:25:25,659 --> 00:25:26,794
George?

606
00:25:27,361 --> 00:25:29,130
Ah! I gotcha.

607
00:25:50,851 --> 00:25:52,119
What do you think it could be?

608
00:25:52,319 --> 00:25:53,788
Quiet, it's about to start.

609
00:25:53,821 --> 00:25:55,022
Today on
Channel 12
News,

610
00:25:55,056 --> 00:25:57,058
we have none other
than the infamous

611
00:25:57,091 --> 00:25:59,627
YouTube sensation,
George Jordan.

612
00:25:59,660 --> 00:26:02,963
Some of you may know him better
as "The Crying Guy"

613
00:26:02,997 --> 00:26:06,767
or "The Do Nothing" guy or even
"Cold Foot".

614
00:26:07,301 --> 00:26:09,737
George, in your own words,

615
00:26:09,770 --> 00:26:11,639
can you tell us what happened
that night?

616
00:26:11,672 --> 00:26:13,207
Well, I was leaving the
liquor store

617
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:15,876
when I heard a horrible,
shrill scream.

618
00:26:15,910 --> 00:26:17,611
- The victim?
- Yes.

619
00:26:17,645 --> 00:26:20,347
And you did nothing to help
that poor woman in distress?

620
00:26:20,948 --> 00:26:23,117
Honestly, she asked for it.

621
00:26:23,150 --> 00:26:24,785
She asked for it.

622
00:26:24,819 --> 00:26:27,354
Are you insinuating that what
the woman was wearing

623
00:26:27,388 --> 00:26:28,823
made her
deserve the attack?

624
00:26:28,856 --> 00:26:30,324
I think rape is a joke.

625
00:26:30,357 --> 00:26:32,026
Fucking idiot.

626
00:26:32,059 --> 00:26:34,695
The assailant in the video was
African-American.

627
00:26:34,728 --> 00:26:36,764
Did this play a factor in your
reaction?

628
00:26:36,797 --> 00:26:39,934
Yes. I hate black people.

629
00:26:39,967 --> 00:26:41,669
Did he just fucking say that?

630
00:26:41,702 --> 00:26:43,237
What a fucking scumbag.

631
00:26:43,270 --> 00:26:45,906
I understand you were on your
way to your girlfriend's house.

632
00:26:45,940 --> 00:26:46,841
Yes!

633
00:26:46,874 --> 00:26:49,143
What if the victim was your
girlfriend?

634
00:26:49,176 --> 00:26:50,344
I could do better.

635
00:26:50,377 --> 00:26:52,746
Would you really be okay
losing the woman

636
00:26:52,780 --> 00:26:53,914
you claim you love?

637
00:26:53,948 --> 00:26:55,983
It was a joke. I was going
along with it.

638
00:26:56,016 --> 00:26:58,185
Are you fucking kidding me?

639
00:26:58,853 --> 00:27:01,255
George, why do you think men
attack women?

640
00:27:01,288 --> 00:27:02,756
For the hits.

641
00:27:02,990 --> 00:27:04,925
They do it for the hits?

642
00:27:04,959 --> 00:27:07,228
He was a really
likable guy, man.

643
00:27:07,261 --> 00:27:08,195
Now nobody's gonna be friends
with him.

644
00:27:08,229 --> 00:27:09,930
I have to say, George, I'm a
little disturbed

645
00:27:09,964 --> 00:27:11,132
by what I'm hearing.

646
00:27:11,165 --> 00:27:14,101
Um. There are rumors on the
comments board that you have

647
00:27:14,135 --> 00:27:16,770
connections to
white supremacist groups.

648
00:27:16,804 --> 00:27:20,241
Tell me, what do you think about
the Nazi party?

649
00:27:21,709 --> 00:27:23,777
I think it was okay.

650
00:27:24,111 --> 00:27:25,346
And the Holocaust.

651
00:27:25,379 --> 00:27:27,781
The whole thing was staged. It
was fake.

652
00:27:27,815 --> 00:27:29,416
Why don't you people get that?

653
00:27:29,450 --> 00:27:32,653
George, I am disgusted even
being in the same room with you.

654
00:27:34,221 --> 00:27:36,090
I think I smell whiskey on your
breath.

655
00:27:36,123 --> 00:27:37,491
I have a drinking problem.

656
00:27:37,526 --> 00:27:39,059
Oh, my God. Well, that
doesn't surprise me.
Oh honey,

657
00:27:39,093 --> 00:27:41,795
We need to do something.
I have one more
question for you George.

658
00:27:42,229 --> 00:27:45,132
What do you think of North
Korean dictator Kim Jong un?

659
00:27:45,332 --> 00:27:46,934
I love Kim.

660
00:27:46,967 --> 00:27:49,103
I would do anything for Kim.

661
00:27:49,136 --> 00:27:50,838
Well, there you have it, folks.

662
00:27:50,871 --> 00:27:53,774
Monsters do exist, and they are
among us.

663
00:27:54,108 --> 00:27:56,710
George Jordan, May you burn in
hell.

664
00:27:56,744 --> 00:27:59,180
When we come back, our very own
James McAuliff

665
00:27:59,213 --> 00:28:01,182
Has been undercover as
a homeless man
He's fucked.

666
00:28:01,215 --> 00:28:02,950
wandering the
valley in search of the

667
00:28:02,983 --> 00:28:05,819
notorious Van Nuys Vagrant
Strangler.

668
00:28:05,853 --> 00:28:09,223
A reminder, the reward for any
tips that lead to the direct

669
00:28:09,256 --> 00:28:13,761
arrest of the strangler
is now up to $40,000.

670
00:28:21,902 --> 00:28:23,204
Greco's Pizza, pick up or
delivery?

671
00:28:24,171 --> 00:28:26,508
Yeah, George, um.

672
00:28:26,541 --> 00:28:28,876
No, don't worry about that.

673
00:28:28,909 --> 00:28:30,744
That-that-that's fine. That's
fine. Uhhh...

674
00:28:30,778 --> 00:28:33,113
You know just, just don't even
come in tomorrow.

675
00:28:33,948 --> 00:28:36,050
Yeah, in fact just,

676
00:28:36,083 --> 00:28:38,085
Just take the week, get better.

677
00:28:38,118 --> 00:28:42,056
Whatever is, uh, you need to do
to get to get better.

678
00:29:23,531 --> 00:29:24,932
Kim?

679
00:29:24,965 --> 00:29:29,903
George, um, can I come in?

680
00:29:29,937 --> 00:29:32,339
If not, I-I-I totally
understand.

681
00:29:32,373 --> 00:29:34,509
No no no no, totally come in.
Please.

682
00:29:35,009 --> 00:29:37,845
Uh, I made you breakfast.

683
00:29:37,878 --> 00:29:39,547
Oh, I can see. Thank you.

684
00:29:39,581 --> 00:29:41,215
It looks great.

685
00:29:42,283 --> 00:29:44,118
Yeah, well, I figured

686
00:29:44,151 --> 00:29:46,787
I still owed you
a meal from the other night, so

687
00:29:47,921 --> 00:29:49,356
I hope you like it.

688
00:29:49,390 --> 00:29:50,858
Oh, my God. It's amazing.

689
00:29:50,891 --> 00:29:52,026
Yeah?

690
00:29:52,059 --> 00:29:53,394
Are you kidding me? It's
incredible.

691
00:29:53,427 --> 00:29:55,229
I'm so glad that you like it.

692
00:29:55,262 --> 00:29:56,564
It's the best breakfast I ever
had.

693
00:30:00,267 --> 00:30:01,135
Okay, uh.

694
00:30:02,102 --> 00:30:03,037
Here I go.

695
00:30:07,107 --> 00:30:09,343
George.

696
00:30:09,943 --> 00:30:12,446
I am so, so sorry

697
00:30:12,479 --> 00:30:14,549
for abandoning
you during your time of need.

698
00:30:15,983 --> 00:30:16,884
You know, I was.

699
00:30:17,951 --> 00:30:19,853
I was scared.

700
00:30:20,287 --> 00:30:22,022
And,

701
00:30:22,056 --> 00:30:24,892
And I didn't know what to do.

702
00:30:25,959 --> 00:30:27,194
Hey ,hey, hey, It's okay.

703
00:30:27,227 --> 00:30:28,262
No!

704
00:30:28,295 --> 00:30:29,330
It's ok.

705
00:30:29,363 --> 00:30:30,364
No it's not.

706
00:30:31,298 --> 00:30:34,501
I hate myself. I hate myself!

707
00:30:34,536 --> 00:30:37,505
Come here, come here.

708
00:30:39,073 --> 00:30:41,942
Hey, I don't blame you, okay?

709
00:30:42,142 --> 00:30:45,145
I was put in a bad situation.

710
00:30:45,179 --> 00:30:46,880
I think I'm out of it now.

711
00:30:46,914 --> 00:30:50,484
But I was just so terrible to
you. Ya know.

712
00:30:50,518 --> 00:30:54,221
And, and you don't deserve that
and,

713
00:30:54,254 --> 00:30:56,990
I love you, and I'm going to
make it up to you.

714
00:30:57,024 --> 00:30:58,158
Okay?

715
00:30:59,927 --> 00:31:00,894
Okay.

716
00:31:00,928 --> 00:31:02,196
It's ok. It's ok.

717
00:31:06,534 --> 00:31:08,570
You're the best.

718
00:31:10,471 --> 00:31:11,905
Huh! Woah!

719
00:31:11,939 --> 00:31:13,107
Sandwiches.

720
00:31:13,140 --> 00:31:14,441
Ohhh!

721
00:31:15,577 --> 00:31:18,212
I want that some day George.

722
00:31:20,047 --> 00:31:22,517
Hi! You're a good boy.

723
00:31:22,550 --> 00:31:24,051
Yes, you are.

724
00:31:24,084 --> 00:31:26,420
You are so handsome.

725
00:31:26,453 --> 00:31:28,255
You are so cute.

726
00:31:28,288 --> 00:31:30,592
I love you. I-I

727
00:31:31,992 --> 00:31:34,094
Howdy, George.

728
00:31:34,128 --> 00:31:35,663
Hey, dog.

729
00:31:35,697 --> 00:31:37,965
I got some bad news for you,
buddy.

730
00:31:37,998 --> 00:31:39,266
What's that?

731
00:31:39,299 --> 00:31:40,934
This isn't real, George.

732
00:31:40,968 --> 00:31:42,403
You're still asleep.

733
00:31:42,436 --> 00:31:43,404
Go figure.

734
00:31:43,437 --> 00:31:45,105
Yeah.

735
00:31:45,139 --> 00:31:46,508
Your life's still shit.

736
00:31:46,541 --> 00:31:47,941
Oh, man.

737
00:32:00,622 --> 00:32:01,656
Kim?

738
00:32:01,689 --> 00:32:02,690
You.

739
00:32:02,724 --> 00:32:03,957
Can I help you?

740
00:32:03,991 --> 00:32:04,659
Fuck you.

741
00:32:04,692 --> 00:32:06,126
Ah, Jesus Christ, lady.

742
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:07,729
What the fuck? What's wrong with
you?

743
00:32:07,762 --> 00:32:09,631
Get out of our
neighborhood
How deep is that
damn basket?

744
00:32:09,664 --> 00:32:13,535
- You damn Nazi fucker!
- Stop!

745
00:32:13,568 --> 00:32:15,570
Jesus!

746
00:32:15,603 --> 00:32:17,070
What the hell?

747
00:32:20,441 --> 00:32:24,612
This is my favorite robe.

748
00:32:29,450 --> 00:32:30,284
Oh, you again?

749
00:32:30,317 --> 00:32:33,588
Fuck you, lady. Fuck you, too!
Yeah!

750
00:32:33,621 --> 00:32:35,022
Yeah, you--

751
00:32:37,625 --> 00:32:38,693
Yeah. Fuck you.

752
00:32:38,726 --> 00:32:41,128
I got an apple.

753
00:33:02,349 --> 00:33:03,718
Hey, Cold Foot.

754
00:33:03,751 --> 00:33:05,452
I see you.

755
00:33:05,486 --> 00:33:06,788
I see you. Cold Foot.

756
00:33:06,821 --> 00:33:08,489
Think you're hiding?

757
00:33:08,523 --> 00:33:10,357
Leave me alone!

758
00:33:11,258 --> 00:33:12,794
Hey. Hey. Cold foot.

759
00:33:12,827 --> 00:33:16,129
Are those a size 12?

760
00:33:16,163 --> 00:33:17,765
It's 1 p.m. on a Tuesday.

761
00:33:17,799 --> 00:33:21,468
Aren't you supposed to be at
school or something?

762
00:33:21,503 --> 00:33:24,104
I'm going to ask you one more
time Cold Foot.

763
00:33:24,404 --> 00:33:27,207
Are those a size 12?

764
00:33:46,226 --> 00:33:48,763
Help! Somebody help me!

765
00:33:48,796 --> 00:33:51,533
I don't know this man! Somebody
call the police! Please!

766
00:33:51,733 --> 00:33:53,066
It's not what you think.

767
00:33:53,100 --> 00:33:54,836
I had a dream. The dog talked.

768
00:33:54,869 --> 00:33:56,136
You brought me breakfast.

769
00:33:56,169 --> 00:33:57,404
That was actually good.

770
00:33:57,437 --> 00:33:59,607
We had passionate sex in my
kitchen.

771
00:34:00,140 --> 00:34:04,077
What the fuck are you rambling
about?

772
00:34:04,779 --> 00:34:07,180
Well, I'm trying to tell you,
Kim.

773
00:34:07,214 --> 00:34:09,817
Is I love you. I want you to be
my wife.

774
00:34:13,253 --> 00:34:14,454
What. what do you say?

775
00:34:14,488 --> 00:34:17,792
Kim, will you be Mrs. Jordan?

776
00:34:21,796 --> 00:34:23,397
Oh fuck!

777
00:34:25,533 --> 00:34:26,801
Why would you do that?

778
00:34:26,834 --> 00:34:29,336
Hey, Kimmy. The dog talked!

779
00:34:29,369 --> 00:34:30,605
He told me.

780
00:34:30,638 --> 00:34:31,606
He told me!

781
00:34:31,639 --> 00:34:32,740
What are you doing?

782
00:34:32,774 --> 00:34:34,207
Kimmy?!

783
00:34:58,566 --> 00:35:00,835
Jordan. George. You're free to
go.

784
00:35:00,868 --> 00:35:02,302
Thank God.

785
00:35:02,837 --> 00:35:04,137
All right, Mr. Jordan.

786
00:35:05,372 --> 00:35:06,874
We don't know what you were
doing today at the flower shop

787
00:35:06,908 --> 00:35:09,242
or what your obsession with
Miss Kim Korine is.

788
00:35:09,276 --> 00:35:12,880
But if we find you within 100
yards of Gloria's flower shop

789
00:35:12,914 --> 00:35:15,883
or Miss Korine, you will be
arrested immediately.

790
00:35:15,917 --> 00:35:17,451
Is that understood?

791
00:35:17,484 --> 00:35:18,553
Understood Officer.

792
00:35:21,556 --> 00:35:22,890
Here are your belongings.

793
00:35:32,265 --> 00:35:33,367
What's this?

794
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:34,167
This isn't mine.

795
00:35:34,201 --> 00:35:36,403
No, That's a gift from the
station.

796
00:35:36,436 --> 00:35:37,572
It's called a rape whistle.

797
00:35:39,373 --> 00:35:41,743
We figured you might need that.

798
00:35:42,209 --> 00:35:43,377
That's hilarious.

799
00:35:43,410 --> 00:35:44,646
On a personal note, Mr. Jordan.

800
00:35:44,679 --> 00:35:48,549
I just want you to know that I
do not like you.

801
00:35:58,225 --> 00:35:59,661
He-Hello?

802
00:35:59,694 --> 00:36:02,697
Meet me and Dad in the park, in
one hour.

803
00:36:02,730 --> 00:36:04,464
I'll be on the third bench.

804
00:36:04,498 --> 00:36:05,566
Ma?

805
00:36:06,768 --> 00:36:07,835
Ma, is that you?

806
00:36:08,970 --> 00:36:10,170
Hello?

807
00:36:24,484 --> 00:36:25,853
What do you want?

808
00:36:26,821 --> 00:36:28,890
Your father and I had an idea

809
00:36:29,389 --> 00:36:31,592
how to get you out of this whole
thing.

810
00:36:32,359 --> 00:36:34,294
Yeah. What is it?

811
00:36:34,327 --> 00:36:36,329
And where's Dad?

812
00:36:36,363 --> 00:36:38,733
He's standing look out.

813
00:36:38,766 --> 00:36:42,537
So, Youtube got you into this
mess.

814
00:36:43,470 --> 00:36:45,707
Maybe YouTube can get you out.

815
00:36:45,740 --> 00:36:47,274
I don't follow you.

816
00:36:47,307 --> 00:36:48,876
Well...

817
00:36:48,910 --> 00:36:52,279
you look like such a little
bitch in that first video.

818
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:54,882
So, you should make a new one,

819
00:36:54,916 --> 00:36:56,718
where you're the hero.

820
00:36:56,751 --> 00:36:58,786
Yeah? And how am I supposed to
do that, Mom?

821
00:36:58,820 --> 00:36:59,721
I don't know.

822
00:36:59,754 --> 00:37:02,890
Get your little friend. Get a
camcorder.

823
00:37:03,390 --> 00:37:05,459
Show everyone how good you are.

824
00:37:06,627 --> 00:37:08,395
No. Stay away from that man.

825
00:37:08,428 --> 00:37:09,731
He's a bitch.

826
00:37:09,964 --> 00:37:12,265
Disgusting. Grow a pair.

827
00:37:12,299 --> 00:37:14,501
I don't care if you don't have
your orthotics in Marcus,

828
00:37:14,535 --> 00:37:16,804
move your goddamn ass.

829
00:37:16,838 --> 00:37:17,805
This way!

830
00:37:34,856 --> 00:37:36,591
This is such bullshit.

831
00:37:45,499 --> 00:37:47,535
Everyone, look who's calling.

832
00:37:47,769 --> 00:37:49,570
It's Jean Beige.

833
00:37:49,604 --> 00:37:53,440
Let's hope it's her
and not that pesky Phoenix.

834
00:37:54,876 --> 00:37:56,010
Hello, Jean.

835
00:37:56,043 --> 00:37:57,612
Is everything all right with the
team?

836
00:37:57,645 --> 00:37:58,579
What's going on?

837
00:37:58,613 --> 00:38:00,548
Jean? No, no, it's George.

838
00:38:00,581 --> 00:38:02,950
Ah...Jean, you're breaking up,

839
00:38:02,984 --> 00:38:04,819
I can't quite hear you.

840
00:38:04,852 --> 00:38:07,522
Maybe we should switch to using
our telekinesis

841
00:38:07,555 --> 00:38:09,891
and special powers to chat.

842
00:38:09,924 --> 00:38:10,992
I'm looking for Kevin.

843
00:38:12,492 --> 00:38:15,096
All right,
You're coming in loud and clear.

844
00:38:15,129 --> 00:38:16,531
What can I do for you?

845
00:38:16,564 --> 00:38:18,966
Hey, meet me at my place
at eight.

846
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,803
I think I have a plan to fix
this.

847
00:38:21,836 --> 00:38:23,104
Yeah. I don't really quite
know if-

848
00:38:24,806 --> 00:38:27,809
George? George?

849
00:38:47,528 --> 00:38:50,497
Oh, hell no.

850
00:38:57,939 --> 00:38:58,973
Coming up next.

851
00:38:59,006 --> 00:39:01,408
George Jordan is back yet again.

852
00:39:01,609 --> 00:39:04,477
It seems he has graduated
from just watching women

853
00:39:04,512 --> 00:39:07,615
be attacked, to actually
committing attacks himself.

854
00:39:08,015 --> 00:39:09,083
The dog talked.

855
00:39:09,116 --> 00:39:10,551
He told me.

856
00:39:10,585 --> 00:39:11,418
He told me!

857
00:39:11,451 --> 00:39:12,286
What are you doing?

858
00:39:20,695 --> 00:39:21,662
Hey, George.

859
00:39:21,996 --> 00:39:23,363
Hey.

860
00:39:25,465 --> 00:39:29,904
Uh, listen, there's something
I need to tell you.

861
00:39:29,937 --> 00:39:31,939
You can't work here anymore.

862
00:39:31,973 --> 00:39:34,407
What do you mean, you're firing
me?

863
00:39:34,441 --> 00:39:36,777
This is the first time
I've taken any personal time.

864
00:39:36,811 --> 00:39:38,846
It has nothing to do with that.
It's just.

865
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:40,815
I can't have someone like you
working here.

866
00:39:40,848 --> 00:39:42,750
I mean, I can barely keep the
doors open as it is--

867
00:39:42,783 --> 00:39:44,118
--Someone like me,
what does that mean?

868
00:39:44,151 --> 00:39:45,452
Someone like me
working here?

869
00:39:45,485 --> 00:39:46,587
It's bad for the image.

870
00:39:46,821 --> 00:39:48,856
This is a-a family
establishment.

871
00:39:48,890 --> 00:39:52,627
And you being a um,

872
00:39:52,660 --> 00:39:53,661
son of a bitch and all.

873
00:39:53,694 --> 00:39:55,596
Image. What image?

874
00:39:55,630 --> 00:39:56,998
This is a shitty pizza place.

875
00:39:57,031 --> 00:39:58,633
You barely get 12 customers a
month.

876
00:39:58,666 --> 00:39:59,800
I'm sorry, George.

877
00:39:59,834 --> 00:40:02,603
No, I'm not sorry.

878
00:40:03,104 --> 00:40:04,138
Goodbye.

879
00:40:04,171 --> 00:40:05,539
So that's how it's going to be.

880
00:40:31,032 --> 00:40:32,199
What happened to you?

881
00:40:33,768 --> 00:40:35,736
I don't want to talk about it.

882
00:40:35,970 --> 00:40:37,238
How you holding up?

883
00:40:37,271 --> 00:40:39,472
Have you not seen the news?

884
00:40:39,507 --> 00:40:42,209
Apparently, I'm a Nazi and rape
enthusiast now.

885
00:40:42,777 --> 00:40:45,012
Oh, and I just got fired.

886
00:40:45,046 --> 00:40:46,948
You hated that job anyways.

887
00:40:46,981 --> 00:40:48,215
Out of everything I just said,

888
00:40:48,249 --> 00:40:50,450
that's what you choose to
address?

889
00:40:51,752 --> 00:40:53,821
To be honest, George.

890
00:40:53,854 --> 00:40:55,690
For a minute there, I was
thinking about something else.

891
00:40:58,592 --> 00:40:59,560
So, what's this about?

892
00:41:00,528 --> 00:41:02,563
We're going to make a
performance piece.

893
00:41:02,596 --> 00:41:06,100
Just like that lying piece of
shit, Suzanne Winters.

894
00:41:06,133 --> 00:41:09,136
A video where I look like the
hero and save the day.

895
00:41:09,170 --> 00:41:10,271
George.

896
00:41:10,304 --> 00:41:11,872
My whole life as a performance
piece.

897
00:41:11,906 --> 00:41:13,107
Yeah. Everyone's going to be
like,

898
00:41:13,140 --> 00:41:14,608
"Fuck yeah, George, get it
done."

899
00:41:14,642 --> 00:41:17,611
This guy knows. Yeah.
Cool. I like it. I like
it a lot.

900
00:41:18,312 --> 00:41:19,981
How you plan on doing it?

901
00:41:20,014 --> 00:41:22,149
Well, you're going to steal the
purse and I'm gonna stop you.

902
00:41:22,183 --> 00:41:23,584
Wait, I'm the bad guy?

903
00:41:23,951 --> 00:41:25,886
Well, no, you're going to be in
the disguise.

904
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:28,022
No one's going to know it's you.

905
00:41:28,322 --> 00:41:29,690
Okay. Uh.

906
00:41:30,057 --> 00:41:31,625
How are we going to get a girl?

907
00:41:31,659 --> 00:41:33,861
I mean, we don't know any,
and no one likes you.

908
00:41:34,095 --> 00:41:35,563
Don't worry.

909
00:41:35,596 --> 00:41:37,231
I have a plan.

910
00:41:37,264 --> 00:41:39,000
You ready?

911
00:41:40,968 --> 00:41:43,137
First we meet at the Rockies on
Sepulveda.

912
00:41:43,571 --> 00:41:45,740
You know the good one
by the Boom-Boom Room.

913
00:41:47,008 --> 00:41:49,844
Then we coast down Sepulveda,
toward the oddball cabaret,

914
00:41:49,877 --> 00:41:51,812
and find our "actress."

915
00:41:53,114 --> 00:41:55,583
Pick her up, find the perfect
location,

916
00:41:55,850 --> 00:41:59,286
shoot it, upload it and watch
the hits roll in.

917
00:42:07,194 --> 00:42:08,696
It's foolproof.

918
00:42:08,729 --> 00:42:10,031
I know, right?

919
00:42:10,064 --> 00:42:11,032
How'd you come up with it?

920
00:42:11,065 --> 00:42:12,633
I don't know. It just came to me

921
00:42:12,666 --> 00:42:14,301
when I was walking through
the park.

922
00:42:14,335 --> 00:42:15,336
This your mom's idea?

923
00:42:15,369 --> 00:42:16,604
It's my mom's idea.

924
00:42:17,238 --> 00:42:18,305
Carol knows best.

925
00:42:20,841 --> 00:42:23,077
- It is fun.
- I mean, that would...

926
00:42:23,110 --> 00:42:24,945
Brian are you fucking kidding
me?

927
00:42:27,248 --> 00:42:28,249
You too.

928
00:42:30,151 --> 00:42:31,752
Why are you dressed like a cop?

929
00:42:31,786 --> 00:42:32,987
What do you mean?
I thought you said

930
00:42:33,020 --> 00:42:34,088
I'm 'sposed to be like a
hero or something.

931
00:42:34,121 --> 00:42:36,624
No. Me!
I'm supposed to save her.

932
00:42:36,657 --> 00:42:38,759
What! Wait. I'm the bad guy?

933
00:42:38,793 --> 00:42:39,960
No, I'm not doing that.

934
00:42:39,994 --> 00:42:41,128
Who would agree to that?

935
00:42:41,162 --> 00:42:43,864
Just get in. I stopped at
7-Eleven and grabbed a mask.

936
00:42:44,131 --> 00:42:46,267
Unbutton that shirt
and take off that stupid badge.

937
00:42:46,300 --> 00:42:47,835
It's not stupid, it's real.

938
00:42:49,804 --> 00:42:51,872
Hey, you. You're that guy,
you're Cold Foot.

939
00:42:51,906 --> 00:42:52,807
Fuck off.

940
00:42:52,840 --> 00:42:53,874
Let's go hookin'.

941
00:43:02,149 --> 00:43:05,853
Hey, boys. I'm Tiff Nomorales.

942
00:43:06,187 --> 00:43:07,621
Well hi, Tiff Nomorales.

943
00:43:07,655 --> 00:43:08,923
We're filmmakers,

944
00:43:08,956 --> 00:43:10,891
and we'd like to know if you
want to be the star

945
00:43:10,925 --> 00:43:11,859
of our next
performance piece.

946
00:43:12,760 --> 00:43:14,295
Are you like, porn guys?

947
00:43:14,328 --> 00:43:16,797
No, no, no, no, no-
Oh, this is the Bang
Hybrid. I've seen this.

948
00:43:16,831 --> 00:43:18,699
- Hey Mom, hey...
- No, no, no, no.

949
00:43:18,732 --> 00:43:20,201
It's. It's. It's nothing like
that at all.

950
00:43:20,234 --> 00:43:22,837
Trust me, you can keep your,
um...

951
00:43:22,870 --> 00:43:24,839
clothes on the entire time if
you'd like.

952
00:43:24,872 --> 00:43:27,641
Okay. That's kinky.

953
00:43:27,675 --> 00:43:28,375
All right.

954
00:43:28,409 --> 00:43:30,778
It's $120 an hour.

955
00:43:30,811 --> 00:43:33,047
No dog. No poop.

956
00:43:33,080 --> 00:43:34,882
And no dairy.

957
00:43:36,083 --> 00:43:37,084
Deal?

958
00:43:37,418 --> 00:43:39,186
No dairy?

959
00:43:40,087 --> 00:43:41,956
All right, guys.

960
00:43:41,989 --> 00:43:44,291
Almost ready.

961
00:43:44,325 --> 00:43:45,292
Let's do this thing!

962
00:43:45,326 --> 00:43:47,995
- Wait. Stop.
- What is that behind you?

963
00:43:51,065 --> 00:43:52,933
Nothin'. C'mon, let's go.

964
00:43:53,334 --> 00:43:54,869
This is takin' forever.

965
00:43:54,902 --> 00:43:56,303
You're gonna have to buy another
hour.

966
00:43:56,337 --> 00:43:59,106
All right, fine. Whatever.
Are you guys set?

967
00:43:59,340 --> 00:44:00,941
- Ready!
- Set.

968
00:44:00,975 --> 00:44:03,277
And action!

969
00:44:06,080 --> 00:44:08,349
What? No! Stop!

970
00:44:08,382 --> 00:44:10,684
Will someone please help,

971
00:44:10,718 --> 00:44:15,089
someone that's really cool
and totally not chicken shit.

972
00:44:15,122 --> 00:44:17,024
Halt bad do-er.

973
00:44:17,057 --> 00:44:19,360
I'm George, and I'm here to stop
you.

974
00:44:20,995 --> 00:44:23,430
Oh, no, not George Jordan.

975
00:44:23,931 --> 00:44:25,266
Not again.

976
00:44:25,299 --> 00:44:27,334
Whatever am I going to do now?

977
00:44:27,368 --> 00:44:29,336
Stop your evil ways, that's
what.

978
00:44:30,070 --> 00:44:32,740
You're lucky. George Jordan
gives second chances.

979
00:44:33,207 --> 00:44:34,875
Second chances.

980
00:44:35,209 --> 00:44:36,310
Now beat it.

981
00:44:36,343 --> 00:44:39,380
Yes, yes. I promise. I am going
to change my evil ways.

982
00:44:39,413 --> 00:44:43,317
All thanks to George Jordan.

983
00:44:43,350 --> 00:44:45,186
Oh, George Jordan.

984
00:44:45,219 --> 00:44:47,721
You are my hero,

985
00:44:47,755 --> 00:44:51,926
and totally, like, not a little
bitch or something.

986
00:44:52,159 --> 00:44:53,961
What can I say?

987
00:44:54,195 --> 00:44:55,996
I do what I can.

988
00:44:58,832 --> 00:45:00,935
Dude. I love it.

989
00:45:00,968 --> 00:45:03,237
Nobody can see this ever.

990
00:45:03,804 --> 00:45:05,773
How did we think this was a good
idea?

991
00:45:07,208 --> 00:45:09,243
Oh, my God, It's perfect.

992
00:45:09,276 --> 00:45:11,145
Wh-what? Why? Who is this?

993
00:45:11,178 --> 00:45:13,314
What are you talking about, who
is this? Where have you been?

994
00:45:13,347 --> 00:45:16,016
I was on the street--
This is George fucking
Jordan.

995
00:45:16,050 --> 00:45:18,185
His fuck ups pay your salary.

996
00:45:18,219 --> 00:45:20,421
I see.

997
00:45:21,021 --> 00:45:22,122
W-wait a second.

998
00:45:22,156 --> 00:45:24,825
I just got a great idea. Um.

999
00:45:25,926 --> 00:45:28,495
How would you like a promotion?

1000
00:45:28,530 --> 00:45:29,964
Are you joshing me?

1001
00:45:29,997 --> 00:45:31,198
Because I-I would love a
promotion.

1002
00:45:31,232 --> 00:45:32,933
I mean, does this mean that
I have to be homeless anymore?

1003
00:45:32,967 --> 00:45:34,335
No, no, no. This works. I like
this.

1004
00:45:34,368 --> 00:45:35,269
Okay. Is there a raise involved?

1005
00:45:35,302 --> 00:45:37,505
No. Your job is to follow
George around

1006
00:45:37,539 --> 00:45:38,872
and film everything he does.

1007
00:45:38,906 --> 00:45:40,241
But what about the strangler?

1008
00:45:40,274 --> 00:45:41,842
Oh fuck the strangler. If you
ask me,

1009
00:45:41,875 --> 00:45:43,877
he's doing us all a solid.
You know what I'm saying?

1010
00:45:44,411 --> 00:45:45,379
Don't touch me.

1011
00:45:45,412 --> 00:45:46,847
Your job is George now.

1012
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:48,015
Okay. But I'm still homeless?

1013
00:45:48,048 --> 00:45:49,483
Yes.
Okay, can I at least go
home?

1014
00:45:49,517 --> 00:45:51,318
No. Here's his address.

1015
00:45:51,352 --> 00:45:53,521
Now you go get him, tiger,

1016
00:45:53,555 --> 00:45:55,256
and I have a lot of faith in
you, okay?

1017
00:45:55,456 --> 00:45:57,191
And get the fuck out
of my office

1018
00:45:57,224 --> 00:45:58,392
'cause your smell is
upsetting me.

1019
00:45:58,425 --> 00:46:00,828
Okay. Thank you so much for
this. I really appreciate--

1020
00:46:00,861 --> 00:46:01,829
Get. Out.

1021
00:46:02,930 --> 00:46:04,832
The 405 is at a
complete standstill,

1022
00:46:04,865 --> 00:46:07,901
and the 101 has five accidents
so get ready not to move.

1023
00:46:07,935 --> 00:46:10,437
And as for the weather, hot and
sweaty.

1024
00:46:10,838 --> 00:46:13,440
That's Southern California,
everybody. Back to you, Suzanne.

1025
00:46:14,074 --> 00:46:16,944
I didn't understand a word she
said.

1026
00:46:16,977 --> 00:46:18,580
But thank you Rosalisa.

1027
00:46:18,613 --> 00:46:20,848
Or should I say gracias?

1028
00:46:22,216 --> 00:46:24,051
Last night, a staged robbery was
caught

1029
00:46:24,084 --> 00:46:26,320
on tape behind a local
convenience store.

1030
00:46:26,621 --> 00:46:29,923
Interestingly, it turns out the
whole thing was staged by none

1031
00:46:29,957 --> 00:46:32,860
other than well-known local
racist and womanizer,

1032
00:46:32,893 --> 00:46:34,529
George Jordan.

1033
00:46:34,562 --> 00:46:37,298
Yes. They paid me to be in that
video.

1034
00:46:37,565 --> 00:46:40,267
George Jordan is a really
strange guy.

1035
00:46:40,934 --> 00:46:43,137
Oh, husbands, if you're sick of
your wives,

1036
00:46:43,170 --> 00:46:45,039
come on down to Sepulveda.

1037
00:46:45,072 --> 00:46:46,907
Ask for Tiff Nomorales.

1038
00:46:46,940 --> 00:46:48,842
I'll do pretty much anything.
Mostly clean.

1039
00:46:50,411 --> 00:46:53,013
Well, you've heard it here
straight from the horse's mouth.

1040
00:46:53,247 --> 00:46:55,816
I'm Clint Benardi. Back to you,
Suzanne.

1041
00:46:56,584 --> 00:46:57,552
Oh no.

1042
00:47:08,996 --> 00:47:11,131
You. I've seen you before.

1043
00:47:11,165 --> 00:47:12,966
What the fuck do you want from
me?

1044
00:47:19,239 --> 00:47:21,208
People like me...

1045
00:47:21,509 --> 00:47:22,910
What is this?

1046
00:47:22,943 --> 00:47:24,345
What does this mean?

1047
00:47:36,990 --> 00:47:38,325
This is the place.

1048
00:47:38,359 --> 00:47:39,326
Now what?

1049
00:47:39,360 --> 00:47:41,128
Now, we wait.

1050
00:47:42,363 --> 00:47:43,364
Well,

1051
00:47:43,698 --> 00:47:44,898
there he is.

1052
00:47:56,210 --> 00:47:57,311
Where the fuck is he going?

1053
00:47:58,445 --> 00:48:01,448
If I was a betting man, I would
say he's going bowling?

1054
00:48:02,383 --> 00:48:04,619
James, go the back door and uh,
see what's going on.

1055
00:48:14,094 --> 00:48:18,365
...kind of
truthful, place within your gut.

1056
00:48:18,399 --> 00:48:20,267
Raise your hand higher.

1057
00:48:20,501 --> 00:48:22,169
Wonder--George.

1058
00:48:22,202 --> 00:48:23,904
George, we've been expecting
you. Welcome.

1059
00:48:26,073 --> 00:48:27,474
What is this?

1060
00:48:27,509 --> 00:48:29,711
This my friend George.

1061
00:48:29,744 --> 00:48:32,146
Brother George, King George,

1062
00:48:32,179 --> 00:48:33,380
is a safe place

1063
00:48:34,348 --> 00:48:36,551
We're like you, we are...

1064
00:48:37,117 --> 00:48:39,253
This is Virals Anonymous.

1065
00:48:39,286 --> 00:48:41,355
I-I believe you've already met
Wormsworth.

1066
00:48:42,256 --> 00:48:43,558
Wormsworth is the victim of

1067
00:48:43,591 --> 00:48:46,126
one of the oldest viral videos,
he...

1068
00:48:48,162 --> 00:48:50,197
He uttered a racial slur

1069
00:48:50,230 --> 00:48:52,166
in a wedding speech.

1070
00:48:52,466 --> 00:48:56,336
And sadly, in those days,
there were no support groups.

1071
00:48:56,370 --> 00:48:59,574
So in a fit of rage,
he took his own tongue.

1072
00:48:59,607 --> 00:49:02,142
Jesus Christ.

1073
00:49:02,176 --> 00:49:03,645
George, please take a seat.

1074
00:49:03,678 --> 00:49:04,679
Please.

1075
00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:08,081
Thank you..

1076
00:49:10,552 --> 00:49:12,052
Everyone, welcome George.

1077
00:49:12,085 --> 00:49:13,521
Hello, George.

1078
00:49:13,555 --> 00:49:18,325
George, everyone here is kinda
like you,

1079
00:49:18,358 --> 00:49:20,360
because the Internet
has destroyed

1080
00:49:20,394 --> 00:49:22,764
their lives in one way
or another.

1081
00:49:22,797 --> 00:49:25,199
Who wants to share their story
with George?

1082
00:49:25,232 --> 00:49:27,735
Yes. Bravery.

1083
00:49:27,769 --> 00:49:30,170
Bravery in the first degree.
Breathe.

1084
00:49:30,204 --> 00:49:31,506
Just keep breathing.

1085
00:49:32,406 --> 00:49:34,475
Hi, I'm Jenna.

1086
00:49:34,509 --> 00:49:36,143
Hi, Jenna.

1087
00:49:39,614 --> 00:49:41,148
How long you think
he's gonna be in there?

1088
00:49:43,250 --> 00:49:45,018
Long enough for us to smoke
this.

1089
00:49:45,319 --> 00:49:46,654
Dude.

1090
00:49:47,054 --> 00:49:48,288
Yessss
- Who's got your back?

1091
00:49:48,322 --> 00:49:50,491
I've lost my career.

1092
00:49:50,825 --> 00:49:53,160
I've lost my friends.

1093
00:49:54,361 --> 00:49:56,430
I've lost my life.

1094
00:49:57,297 --> 00:49:58,499
Thank you for sharing, Jenna.

1095
00:50:00,300 --> 00:50:01,468
Thank you, Jenna.

1096
00:50:01,502 --> 00:50:03,203
Wonderful. Who else?

1097
00:50:04,271 --> 00:50:07,107
Who else is going to take the
journey?

1098
00:50:07,140 --> 00:50:09,544
The journey of truth? Yes.

1099
00:50:14,314 --> 00:50:16,250
Hi, I'm Karl.

1100
00:50:16,283 --> 00:50:17,451
Hi Karl.

1101
00:50:20,420 --> 00:50:22,590
Hungry, are we?

1102
00:50:23,725 --> 00:50:26,426
Uh. Yes. Yes? Hungry. Yes.

1103
00:50:27,227 --> 00:50:29,429
I was looking for food

1104
00:50:29,463 --> 00:50:33,635
in the garbage to eat,
put in my mouth and eat.

1105
00:50:33,668 --> 00:50:35,335
- You're in luck.
- Oh.

1106
00:50:35,369 --> 00:50:38,138
My wife just happened to pack me
an extra lunch.

1107
00:50:38,171 --> 00:50:40,808
I think it's a ham sandwich.

1108
00:50:43,645 --> 00:50:46,079
Would you like it?

1109
00:50:46,514 --> 00:50:48,683
You know, on second thought, I'm
actually, uh,

1110
00:50:48,716 --> 00:50:51,285
pretty full from all the garbage
that I had earlier,

1111
00:50:51,318 --> 00:50:53,821
so I'm just not going to eat
anything else, because

1112
00:50:53,855 --> 00:50:56,156
I'm just--Thank you, though.
I really, really appreciate--

1113
00:50:56,189 --> 00:50:57,324
Nonsense.

1114
00:50:57,357 --> 00:51:00,227
- It's in my system, and--
- You look famished.

1115
00:51:01,529 --> 00:51:03,130
Yes, that's the look I was going
for.

1116
00:51:03,163 --> 00:51:04,799
So I'll take that as a
compliment.

1117
00:51:07,467 --> 00:51:08,302
Oh, look at that.

1118
00:51:08,335 --> 00:51:10,304
It's a ham sandwich, like you
said.

1119
00:51:10,337 --> 00:51:12,105
It's got lettuce and everything
on it.

1120
00:51:12,139 --> 00:51:13,240
It's a ham sandwich.

1121
00:51:13,273 --> 00:51:14,542
It's a ham sandwich, dude.

1122
00:51:14,576 --> 00:51:16,878
Dude, Norman Reedus is not in
Powder.

1123
00:51:16,911 --> 00:51:20,213
Dude, yes, Norman Reedus was
Powder. What?

1124
00:51:20,247 --> 00:51:21,214
What?

1125
00:51:21,248 --> 00:51:24,719
Norman Reedus is like,
he's like a gruff man.

1126
00:51:24,752 --> 00:51:26,554
Powder was Jim--Hold on.

1127
00:51:26,588 --> 00:51:29,657
Carl Jr. goes to Virals
Anonymous for Kids.

1128
00:51:30,223 --> 00:51:31,124
So it's just--

1129
00:51:32,225 --> 00:51:34,762
Alright. Maybe it's. Maybe it's
enough for today.

1130
00:51:34,796 --> 00:51:36,129
Okay.

1131
00:51:36,163 --> 00:51:37,164
Okay.

1132
00:51:38,198 --> 00:51:39,767
That's the walk of a brave man.

1133
00:51:39,801 --> 00:51:41,603
Thank you, Carl.

1134
00:51:41,636 --> 00:51:42,502
Who else?

1135
00:51:43,370 --> 00:51:44,872
Who else wants to be brave like
Carl?

1136
00:51:47,441 --> 00:51:48,442
Gary!

1137
00:51:49,844 --> 00:51:55,182
...search the movie Powder.

1138
00:51:55,215 --> 00:51:57,518
Yeah, look right there.

1139
00:51:57,919 --> 00:51:59,319
That's--

1140
00:51:59,353 --> 00:52:01,254
Are you just messing with me?

1141
00:52:01,723 --> 00:52:03,858
You see his dick in that movie,
too.

1142
00:52:03,891 --> 00:52:04,859
Hello.

1143
00:52:06,594 --> 00:52:07,762
My name is Tim and I--

1144
00:52:07,795 --> 00:52:08,730
Okay.

1145
00:52:08,763 --> 00:52:11,398
I'm sorry to cut you off, but
who are you?

1146
00:52:11,766 --> 00:52:14,301
Who are any of you?
And what are you doing here?

1147
00:52:14,334 --> 00:52:16,303
And why the hell does this guy
know where I live?

1148
00:52:16,336 --> 00:52:18,405
You're famous, George.

1149
00:52:18,438 --> 00:52:19,707
And Google.

1150
00:52:19,741 --> 00:52:22,275
I'm. I'm assuming that he
Googled you,

1151
00:52:23,377 --> 00:52:25,412
but we're not your enemies,
George.

1152
00:52:25,947 --> 00:52:29,316
We're virals anonymous.

1153
00:52:29,550 --> 00:52:30,752
We're like you.

1154
00:52:30,785 --> 00:52:32,452
You're like us.

1155
00:52:32,486 --> 00:52:33,921
So join us.

1156
00:52:33,955 --> 00:52:36,223
Okay. This is getting so weird.

1157
00:52:36,256 --> 00:52:37,290
You're one of us.

1158
00:52:38,492 --> 00:52:39,560
One of us?

1159
00:52:39,594 --> 00:52:40,695
One of us.

1160
00:52:40,728 --> 00:52:43,765
Oh, fuck this.

1161
00:52:43,798 --> 00:52:45,198
Let him go.

1162
00:52:45,499 --> 00:52:46,601
He'll be back.

1163
00:52:50,872 --> 00:52:52,807
Oh, shit. I'm so sorry.

1164
00:52:52,840 --> 00:52:54,542
No, what are you doing man, stop
it, stop it!

1165
00:52:55,009 --> 00:52:56,811
What are you dusting
him off for?

1166
00:52:56,844 --> 00:52:58,278
Oh, get him.

1167
00:52:58,311 --> 00:53:00,715
Oh, dude.

1168
00:53:01,381 --> 00:53:03,216
Oh, you saved my life.

1169
00:53:03,250 --> 00:53:04,418
You know who that was?

1170
00:53:04,451 --> 00:53:05,887
No, why?

1171
00:53:05,920 --> 00:53:07,287
That was the strangler.

1172
00:53:07,822 --> 00:53:10,390
Oh, thank you.

1173
00:53:10,424 --> 00:53:14,394
My names James, I'm a reporter
at Channel 12 news--

1174
00:53:14,428 --> 00:53:16,496
Oh, no, not you fucking guys
again.

1175
00:53:16,798 --> 00:53:17,632
Haven't you done enough?

1176
00:53:17,665 --> 00:53:19,534
What's this one going to
be about, huh?

1177
00:53:19,567 --> 00:53:20,735
Oh, no, no, dude, it's not like
that.

1178
00:53:20,768 --> 00:53:22,235
Don't--I don't give a shit.

1179
00:53:22,269 --> 00:53:24,271
You want a freak show? Go in
there.

1180
00:53:26,473 --> 00:53:26,874
What're you talk--wait, wait,
wait, man!

1181
00:53:26,908 --> 00:53:28,609
No! Fuck you.

1182
00:53:29,276 --> 00:53:30,912
Hey, wait a minute, wait man,
wait.

1183
00:53:33,047 --> 00:53:34,749
What's he talking about?

1184
00:53:34,782 --> 00:53:37,384
And then you look inside there.

1185
00:53:37,417 --> 00:53:39,854
What the fuck? Where were you
guys?

1186
00:53:40,922 --> 00:53:42,456
Hey!

1187
00:53:42,489 --> 00:53:44,926
What's up. You wanna hit this?

1188
00:53:49,931 --> 00:53:51,532
- Jesus Christ, LADY.
- Get out! Get out!

1189
00:53:51,566 --> 00:53:53,601
What the hell? Where do you keep
coming from?

1190
00:53:53,634 --> 00:53:55,803
Will you leave me alone
already?
Get out! Get out!

1191
00:54:06,914 --> 00:54:08,649
What is it?

1192
00:54:08,683 --> 00:54:09,717
I just can't do it. I-I can't do
it anymore, Suzanne.

1193
00:54:09,751 --> 00:54:11,018
Oh my god. That must be--

1194
00:54:11,052 --> 00:54:13,955
--that must be so hard for you
to understand

1195
00:54:13,988 --> 00:54:16,858
that I don't give a fuck about
your sleep cycle!

1196
00:54:16,891 --> 00:54:19,392
Now, Elliot, you have one job.

1197
00:54:19,827 --> 00:54:22,663
One job, and that is to bring me
content.

1198
00:54:23,865 --> 00:54:26,500
So get out there and do your
fucking job.

1199
00:54:26,534 --> 00:54:28,002
But, Suzanne,

1200
00:54:28,035 --> 00:54:30,738
Um, it's Miss Winters and
you don't

1201
00:54:30,772 --> 00:54:32,807
want to be on Miss Winters
bad side do you?

1202
00:54:32,840 --> 00:54:34,609
- No, Miss Winters.
- No...

1203
00:54:34,642 --> 00:54:35,910
and that's what I thought.

1204
00:54:35,943 --> 00:54:37,845
Now get the fuck out of my
office.

1205
00:54:37,879 --> 00:54:38,880
Yes, Miss Winters.

1206
00:54:39,981 --> 00:54:41,682
- Get out.
- Yeah.

1207
00:54:41,716 --> 00:54:44,451
Go! Jesus.

1208
00:54:45,086 --> 00:54:46,286
Sorry.

1209
00:54:46,788 --> 00:54:48,956
Oh, James, My guy.

1210
00:54:49,422 --> 00:54:51,324
James, my man.

1211
00:54:51,358 --> 00:54:52,492
What do you got for me?

1212
00:54:52,527 --> 00:54:55,530
I have for-for you, some footage
of George.

1213
00:54:55,563 --> 00:54:57,031
Ah!

1214
00:54:57,064 --> 00:55:00,433
That I think you might
wanna see.
Oh, my God. Do I? Ah!

1215
00:55:01,468 --> 00:55:02,537
What the fuck did I tell you

1216
00:55:02,570 --> 00:55:03,938
about touching my things?

1217
00:55:07,842 --> 00:55:08,876
Oh, shit.

1218
00:55:08,910 --> 00:55:11,946
I'm so sorry.

1219
00:55:11,979 --> 00:55:14,015
Shit. I'm sorry.

1220
00:55:14,782 --> 00:55:16,083
James, do you realize--

1221
00:55:16,117 --> 00:55:17,450
Do you realize what you've done?

1222
00:55:17,484 --> 00:55:19,754
Yes, I do. That, that is the
strangler.

1223
00:55:19,787 --> 00:55:21,956
That is his stupid face.
And his stupid ponytail.

1224
00:55:22,590 --> 00:55:24,959
Now we can put all this mindless
killing to an end.

1225
00:55:24,992 --> 00:55:26,727
We're going to get this guy.
We're going to get him.

1226
00:55:26,761 --> 00:55:29,831
- Yeah. Yesss.
- Yes!.

1227
00:55:31,165 --> 00:55:32,465
You know what? I have a great
idea, di-

1228
00:55:32,499 --> 00:55:34,802
You did a really great
job.
Thank you so much.

1229
00:55:34,836 --> 00:55:37,470
You're welcome. I think you
should go home tonight

1230
00:55:37,505 --> 00:55:39,472
and get a good night's rest.

1231
00:55:39,507 --> 00:55:42,143
Maybe take a shower.
I am going to shower all
this grime.

1232
00:55:42,176 --> 00:55:44,745
I'm gonna get in bed.
I'm just going to nap it out.

1233
00:55:44,779 --> 00:55:46,647
No, seriously.
Get the fuck out of here

1234
00:55:46,681 --> 00:55:48,749
because your smell is stinking
up the room again.

1235
00:55:48,783 --> 00:55:49,784
Thank you.

1236
00:56:08,569 --> 00:56:10,771
This fucking lady again.

1237
00:56:10,805 --> 00:56:12,874
You got to be fucking kidding
me.

1238
00:56:16,544 --> 00:56:18,112
Let's see how you like it,
bitch.

1239
00:56:19,479 --> 00:56:21,048
Wait, man, it's-it's me.
It's Brian.

1240
00:56:22,083 --> 00:56:22,984
Shit. Sorry, man.

1241
00:56:23,017 --> 00:56:24,652
I thought you were this crazy
old lady,

1242
00:56:24,685 --> 00:56:26,187
and she really wants me
out of the neighborhood.

1243
00:56:26,220 --> 00:56:28,589
So you thought I really was an
old lady

1244
00:56:28,623 --> 00:56:29,991
and you were about to beat me
with an apple?

1245
00:56:30,925 --> 00:56:32,760
What has become of you, George
Jordan?

1246
00:56:32,793 --> 00:56:35,596
This old lady's relentless.
Like I might call the cops.

1247
00:56:35,630 --> 00:56:36,831
Oh, I don't think you have to.

1248
00:56:36,864 --> 00:56:38,398
I think they're already on their
way.

1249
00:56:39,033 --> 00:56:41,602
Wait, why would the cops be
coming here?

1250
00:56:41,636 --> 00:56:43,137
Take it you haven't seen the
news yet?

1251
00:56:43,571 --> 00:56:45,139
No, I just woke up.

1252
00:56:52,647 --> 00:56:53,848
What are you doing?

1253
00:56:54,248 --> 00:56:55,683
Why did you bring all that?

1254
00:56:56,183 --> 00:56:57,184
Dude.

1255
00:56:57,818 --> 00:56:58,853
I have a plan.

1256
00:56:59,954 --> 00:57:00,888
Ladies and gentlemen, the
footage

1257
00:57:00,922 --> 00:57:04,558
you are about to see
is extremely disturbing.

1258
00:57:04,859 --> 00:57:07,695
Our very own undercover
reporter, James McAuliff,

1259
00:57:07,728 --> 00:57:09,697
was about to reveal
the true identity

1260
00:57:09,730 --> 00:57:11,899
of the notorious
Van Nuys Vagrant Strangler

1261
00:57:12,533 --> 00:57:15,102
when none other than local
pariah George Jordan

1262
00:57:15,136 --> 00:57:16,137
had to intervene.

1263
00:57:19,173 --> 00:57:20,341
Fuck you.

1264
00:57:20,374 --> 00:57:24,645
Unfortunately, due to George's
actions, James was unable

1265
00:57:24,679 --> 00:57:26,781
to get a clear shot of the
Strangler's face,

1266
00:57:26,814 --> 00:57:28,849
leaving him still at large.

1267
00:57:28,883 --> 00:57:31,585
Are George Jordan
and the Strangler in cahoots?

1268
00:57:31,786 --> 00:57:33,921
Has George been helping him all
along?

1269
00:57:34,255 --> 00:57:37,792
These are the questions that
should be on everyone's mind.

1270
00:57:38,559 --> 00:57:40,761
I'm Suzanne Winters with Channel
12 News.

1271
00:57:41,028 --> 00:57:44,265
As a reminder for any tips that
lead to the direct arrest of

1272
00:57:44,298 --> 00:57:49,170
the Strangler, the reward is now
a whopping $75,000.

1273
00:57:49,670 --> 00:57:50,671
And we're off air

1274
00:57:54,642 --> 00:57:56,177
Hey, Suzanne, I need to talk to
you.

1275
00:57:56,210 --> 00:57:58,079
Wait, Suzanne, I need to talk to
you. Hey!

1276
00:57:58,746 --> 00:57:59,714
Suzanne?

1277
00:57:59,747 --> 00:58:01,048
Yes!

1278
00:58:01,749 --> 00:58:02,850
Yes!

1279
00:58:02,883 --> 00:58:04,018
What was that?

1280
00:58:04,051 --> 00:58:06,821
Oh, that was a slam dunk, James.

1281
00:58:07,021 --> 00:58:08,155
That's what that was.

1282
00:58:08,189 --> 00:58:09,824
That's not what I gave you.

1283
00:58:09,857 --> 00:58:10,825
James.

1284
00:58:10,858 --> 00:58:13,794
James, What you gave me was
garbage, Okay?

1285
00:58:14,261 --> 00:58:18,899
But I squeezed that garbage into
coal, uh. Uh.

1286
00:58:18,933 --> 00:58:22,937
Then I squeezed that
call into a diamond. Ah.

1287
00:58:23,270 --> 00:58:26,774
Unh...yessss...fagh!

1288
00:58:27,108 --> 00:58:28,542
I'm sorry. What?

1289
00:58:28,576 --> 00:58:31,045
...What, what, what,
what?

1290
00:58:31,078 --> 00:58:33,047
Like what the fuck are you still
doing in my office?

1291
00:58:33,080 --> 00:58:34,915
Get the fuck out of here.

1292
00:58:34,949 --> 00:58:37,018
'Cause Winters is a comin'.

1293
00:58:37,051 --> 00:58:38,019
That's right.

1294
00:58:38,052 --> 00:58:39,987
And it's gonna be a cold one.

1295
00:58:41,622 --> 00:58:43,257
Yeah!

1296
00:58:43,290 --> 00:58:44,225
You're fucking crazy. You
know what, fuck it.
Yeah!

1297
00:58:44,258 --> 00:58:45,226
I'm out, I quit.

1298
00:58:45,259 --> 00:58:46,861
Ok, fine! Have it your way. Oh.

1299
00:58:49,864 --> 00:58:52,333
Oh, Hey, Security,
could you please escort

1300
00:58:52,366 --> 00:58:54,268
Mr. McAuliff out of my office?

1301
00:58:54,301 --> 00:58:56,037
He's having a hard time
understanding

1302
00:58:56,070 --> 00:58:58,005
his immediate resignation.

1303
00:58:58,039 --> 00:58:59,006
Thank you.

1304
00:58:59,040 --> 00:59:00,107
Suzanne.

1305
00:59:00,141 --> 00:59:02,610
Give me the footage.
I'm turning it into the police.

1306
00:59:02,843 --> 00:59:05,012
Oh, are you talking about,
you're talking about this?

1307
00:59:05,046 --> 00:59:06,614
- Yes.
- Oh, you want that?

1308
00:59:06,647 --> 00:59:08,049
Yeah, that's what I want. Can I
have that? Please?

1309
00:59:08,082 --> 00:59:10,017
- Here ya go.
- Sir. Sir. Get off me.

1310
00:59:10,051 --> 00:59:10,885
Hey, listen, she's got
the footage
I thought you wanted it

1311
00:59:10,918 --> 00:59:12,620
of the Strangler! Who's killing
people!

1312
00:59:12,653 --> 00:59:13,754
This is not right.

1313
00:59:13,788 --> 00:59:16,690
This is not right. Suzanne, I'll
have your ass! Oh, sir!

1314
00:59:16,724 --> 00:59:18,359
Make up your mind.

1315
00:59:19,827 --> 00:59:22,029
But think about this. How many
movies have Vincent D'Onofrio

1316
00:59:22,063 --> 00:59:23,631
and a Velociraptor?

1317
00:59:23,664 --> 00:59:25,066
My two favorite things.

1318
00:59:25,099 --> 00:59:26,067
Oh, yeah.

1319
00:59:26,100 --> 00:59:29,703
Man came out here with an
animal, a pet cow.

1320
00:59:29,737 --> 00:59:31,072
It means the world to me.

1321
00:59:31,105 --> 00:59:32,773
I'd like to have him back for
good.

1322
00:59:32,807 --> 00:59:33,941
Yagh!

1323
00:59:35,242 --> 00:59:37,244
Uh-oh, get him some sugar.

1324
00:59:37,278 --> 00:59:38,279
And water!

1325
00:59:38,312 --> 00:59:40,014
Yeah. Okay.

1326
00:59:40,047 --> 00:59:41,315
Well, Suzanne says we're back
on George,

1327
00:59:41,348 --> 00:59:42,750
so back in the van,
A.S.A.P.

1328
00:59:42,783 --> 00:59:43,784
Shotgun.

1329
00:59:46,220 --> 00:59:47,388
Here, Miss Winters.

1330
00:59:47,421 --> 00:59:50,157
That collection of people
saying the N-word you wanted.

1331
00:59:50,391 --> 00:59:52,726
They use that hard R right?

1332
00:59:52,993 --> 00:59:54,228
Yep. All of them.

1333
00:59:54,261 --> 00:59:55,162
Good shit.

1334
00:59:55,196 --> 00:59:56,363
Good shit.

1335
00:59:56,397 --> 00:59:57,998
How did you manage
that?
Does it...

1336
00:59:58,032 --> 00:59:59,066
You know what? It doesn't really
matter.

1337
00:59:59,100 --> 01:00:01,202
I don't give a shit.
Just keep up the good work.

1338
01:00:01,235 --> 01:00:02,169
Do I have to?

1339
01:00:02,203 --> 01:00:03,671
Brring! Oh, my God.

1340
01:00:03,704 --> 01:00:04,972
I've got to take that.

1341
01:00:05,005 --> 01:00:06,173
Hello. How are you?

1342
01:00:06,207 --> 01:00:07,374
Oh, I'm good. Yeah, great.

1343
01:00:07,408 --> 01:00:08,275
Didn't even...ring.

1344
01:00:09,410 --> 01:00:12,346
You're still standing here,
and I don't know why.

1345
01:00:16,217 --> 01:00:17,184
Great.

1346
01:00:17,218 --> 01:00:19,253
How are the kids, Dude?

1347
01:00:21,255 --> 01:00:23,791
Dude. Why is this taking so
long?

1348
01:00:23,824 --> 01:00:26,961
Look, you want it done fast or
you want it done right? C'mon.

1349
01:00:29,363 --> 01:00:31,232
Dude stop. Do you hear that?

1350
01:00:31,732 --> 01:00:32,766
Oh shit!

1351
01:00:50,384 --> 01:00:56,157
I'm so sorry dear laddie. Thank
you.

1352
01:00:58,359 --> 01:00:59,360
Shit.

1353
01:00:59,393 --> 01:01:00,828
I can't believe that worked.

1354
01:01:03,430 --> 01:01:05,199
What have I been trying to tell
ya, George?

1355
01:01:05,232 --> 01:01:08,068
My whole life is a
performance piece.

1356
01:01:22,183 --> 01:01:24,418
Man, why people are so mean to
the elderly.

1357
01:01:24,451 --> 01:01:26,987
Shut up, Brian. They know who we
are.

1358
01:01:27,021 --> 01:01:29,023
What do you guys want? You wanna
kill us?

1359
01:01:29,056 --> 01:01:30,191
'Cause I'm totally fine with
that now.

1360
01:01:30,224 --> 01:01:31,859
No, no, I'm not.

1361
01:01:31,892 --> 01:01:34,094
Okay, guys, guys, hey,
relax.
--not speaking for the
two of us.

1362
01:01:34,128 --> 01:01:36,230
We're not going to kill you.
Okay?

1363
01:01:36,263 --> 01:01:38,799
George, I want to apologize,
man.

1364
01:01:38,832 --> 01:01:41,135
I'm sorry for everything.

1365
01:01:41,168 --> 01:01:42,269
Wait a minute.

1366
01:01:42,303 --> 01:01:44,972
You're that homeless reporter
from the bowling alley?

1367
01:01:45,005 --> 01:01:45,873
Yes. Okay. Yeah, I'm.

1368
01:01:45,906 --> 01:01:46,740
But I'm not homeless. I'm a
reporter.

1369
01:01:46,774 --> 01:01:48,342
But yes, and I was also in
the alley

1370
01:01:48,375 --> 01:01:49,910
where you guys shot that
weird video.

1371
01:01:49,944 --> 01:01:51,513
There was guy in the alley!?

1372
01:01:51,546 --> 01:01:53,515
What I thought he was homeless,
dude!

1373
01:01:53,548 --> 01:01:55,849
C'mon, how am I supposed to know
he's some kinda secret agent.

1374
01:01:55,883 --> 01:01:57,117
Dude, I can't believe you.

1375
01:01:57,151 --> 01:01:59,053
How stupid can you be?

1376
01:01:59,086 --> 01:02:00,988
That's a pot calling the kettle
black.

1377
01:02:01,021 --> 01:02:02,056
Who are they?

1378
01:02:02,089 --> 01:02:03,023
Gary.

1379
01:02:03,057 --> 01:02:04,024
- Bobby.
- Brian!

1380
01:02:04,058 --> 01:02:06,393
Guys, can we focus on the task
at hand, please?

1381
01:02:07,328 --> 01:02:09,763
George, you wanna clear your
name right?

1382
01:02:09,797 --> 01:02:10,864
Right.

1383
01:02:10,898 --> 01:02:12,499
And you want to see Suzanne
Winters get hers, right?

1384
01:02:12,534 --> 01:02:13,767
- Right.
- Wait, what?

1385
01:02:13,801 --> 01:02:14,768
Well, so do I.

1386
01:02:15,803 --> 01:02:17,271
So what can I do?

1387
01:02:17,304 --> 01:02:20,841
Okay, look, man,
I'm going to need you to be

1388
01:02:20,874 --> 01:02:24,812
George Jordan, America's most
hated man one last time.

1389
01:02:25,212 --> 01:02:27,481
Wha-wha-what is happening?

1390
01:02:29,584 --> 01:02:30,552
Miss Winters?

1391
01:02:30,585 --> 01:02:32,486
Um. Yes. Who are you?

1392
01:02:32,520 --> 01:02:33,454
Me? Oh, I'm John.

1393
01:02:33,487 --> 01:02:34,488
Yeah, I'm the new intern.

1394
01:02:34,522 --> 01:02:37,391
Oh, oh my God. I don't care.
What do you want?

1395
01:02:37,424 --> 01:02:39,827
Oh, it's that George Jordan guy.

1396
01:02:39,860 --> 01:02:42,062
He's out there and he's losing
it.

1397
01:02:42,096 --> 01:02:43,130
Wait. Where is he? He's outside
the studio.

1398
01:02:43,163 --> 01:02:44,999
He's outside the studio.

1399
01:02:45,032 --> 01:02:46,500
Good work, Tom.

1400
01:02:46,534 --> 01:02:48,302
Oh, thanks! It's John,
though.
Don't care.

1401
01:02:48,335 --> 01:02:49,903
Right, no You don't care.

1402
01:02:49,937 --> 01:02:51,071
I hate myself too.

1403
01:02:55,342 --> 01:02:56,343
George!

1404
01:02:56,377 --> 01:02:57,444
Move your ass.

1405
01:02:57,478 --> 01:03:00,347
George! What are you doing,
George?

1406
01:03:00,381 --> 01:03:02,550
I'm doing what everyone is
telling me to do.

1407
01:03:02,584 --> 01:03:04,485
Okay? Don't be so melodramatic.

1408
01:03:04,519 --> 01:03:06,120
It's a ten foot drop.

1409
01:03:06,153 --> 01:03:07,921
Yeah, well, it's high enough for
me.

1410
01:03:07,955 --> 01:03:09,089
Shit.

1411
01:03:12,326 --> 01:03:15,296
Shit, shit, it's not in here,
where the fuck is it.

1412
01:03:21,502 --> 01:03:24,038
Hey, what are you doing?

1413
01:03:24,572 --> 01:03:27,274
Um, what are you doing?

1414
01:03:27,308 --> 01:03:28,309
Uh...

1415
01:03:32,479 --> 01:03:35,382
Okay. Everyone knows you're not
going to jump.

1416
01:03:40,254 --> 01:03:41,955
I'll jump when I'm ready.

1417
01:03:42,990 --> 01:03:45,192
What's with the toilet paper?

1418
01:03:45,225 --> 01:03:47,094
Uh-oh, TP.

1419
01:03:48,262 --> 01:03:49,396
It was--

1420
01:03:50,565 --> 01:03:53,000
well, um...

1421
01:03:54,101 --> 01:03:55,537
I was going to take a shit on
that desk

1422
01:03:55,570 --> 01:03:58,205
as my official resignation.

1423
01:03:58,238 --> 01:04:00,508
You're gonna take a shit on the
desk?

1424
01:04:01,342 --> 01:04:02,476
Aren't you afraid of what
she might do

1425
01:04:02,510 --> 01:04:03,444
if she finds out it's you?

1426
01:04:03,477 --> 01:04:06,246
Nah, man. I got so much dirt on
that bitch.

1427
01:04:07,281 --> 01:04:08,415
I'm untouchable.

1428
01:04:08,449 --> 01:04:09,983
What dirt?

1429
01:04:10,017 --> 01:04:13,387
Well...let's just say I keep the
cameras rolling.

1430
01:04:14,321 --> 01:04:15,422
You got, you got.

1431
01:04:15,456 --> 01:04:16,223
You got foot--I need--I'm
going to

1432
01:04:16,256 --> 01:04:17,891
need that footage
Elliot, please.

1433
01:04:17,925 --> 01:04:19,259
Can I have that footage, please,
Elliot?

1434
01:04:19,293 --> 01:04:21,295
I'm asking you very nicely.
Can I have that footage?

1435
01:04:21,495 --> 01:04:22,296
I need it.

1436
01:04:22,329 --> 01:04:24,331
That footage is my insurance
policy.

1437
01:04:24,365 --> 01:04:25,667
I'm going to hand it to you?

1438
01:04:25,700 --> 01:04:27,401
How do I know that
you're not working for Suzanne?

1439
01:04:27,434 --> 01:04:32,139
You think I work for Suza--you
think...c'mon man! i don't--

1440
01:04:33,140 --> 01:04:34,576
Okay, how can I prove it to you?

1441
01:04:44,619 --> 01:04:46,453
You first.

1442
01:04:51,458 --> 01:04:53,927
I hope you got a big one in the
chamber.

1443
01:04:53,961 --> 01:04:55,262
'Cause I sure do.

1444
01:04:55,295 --> 01:04:56,997
Okay. Okay. That's it.

1445
01:04:57,030 --> 01:04:58,399
I'm coming up.

1446
01:04:58,432 --> 01:04:59,567
Oh, shit.

1447
01:04:59,601 --> 01:05:01,135
I didn't see that coming.

1448
01:05:05,339 --> 01:05:07,609
George, you never cease to amaze
me.

1449
01:05:08,375 --> 01:05:10,444
I mean, come on, George

1450
01:05:15,015 --> 01:05:17,484
George Jordan, can you tell us

1451
01:05:17,519 --> 01:05:19,286
why you're up here on
this ledge?

1452
01:05:19,319 --> 01:05:22,557
Has the guilt of your own sins
finally caught up to you?

1453
01:05:22,590 --> 01:05:24,992
Is this your apology to the
world?

1454
01:05:25,593 --> 01:05:26,728
Oh, um.

1455
01:05:26,761 --> 01:05:28,563
Here Miss Winters, that
collection of

1456
01:05:28,596 --> 01:05:31,999
people saying the
N-word you wanted.

1457
01:05:32,032 --> 01:05:34,501
They use the hard R right?

1458
01:05:34,769 --> 01:05:36,336
Yes, all of them.

1459
01:05:36,571 --> 01:05:38,138
Good shit. Good shit.

1460
01:05:38,172 --> 01:05:41,041
I don't give a fuck about your
sleep cycle.

1461
01:05:41,074 --> 01:05:43,711
No, no, no!

1462
01:05:44,445 --> 01:05:46,213
Well, well, well.

1463
01:05:46,246 --> 01:05:48,716
Miss Winters, how does it feel--

1464
01:05:48,750 --> 01:05:51,051
Oh, shit.

1465
01:05:51,084 --> 01:05:54,254
Oh, fuck me.

1466
01:05:54,288 --> 01:05:56,490
Yoo-hoo! Wait a sec.

1467
01:05:56,524 --> 01:05:58,693
No, no, no, wait, wait, No.

1468
01:05:58,726 --> 01:06:02,029
This isn't what you think! You
guys know me!

1469
01:06:02,062 --> 01:06:03,464
This thing is clearly doctored.

1470
01:06:03,497 --> 01:06:05,265
That's not even real.

1471
01:06:05,299 --> 01:06:06,333
Come on.

1472
01:06:06,366 --> 01:06:08,335
I'm Suzanne Winters!

1473
01:06:08,368 --> 01:06:12,439
I am Suzanne
mother-fucking Winters

1474
01:06:12,473 --> 01:06:15,275
and fuck children,
and fuck my neighbors

1475
01:06:15,309 --> 01:06:19,012
and fuck puppies and fuck
kittens and fuck you Elliot!

1476
01:06:19,046 --> 01:06:20,013
Shut the fuck up, Elliot.

1477
01:06:20,047 --> 01:06:21,014
YOU!

1478
01:06:21,048 --> 01:06:22,316
Oh, my God.

1479
01:06:24,117 --> 01:06:25,520
Why isn't anyone doing
anything!?

1480
01:06:26,220 --> 01:06:27,522
Okay, I gotcha, I gotcha.

1481
01:06:27,555 --> 01:06:28,989
Okay, hold on.

1482
01:06:33,393 --> 01:06:35,663
Suzanne Winters is awaiting
trial for withholding

1483
01:06:35,697 --> 01:06:38,666
evidence of the Van Nuys Vagrant
Strangler's Identity.

1484
01:06:38,700 --> 01:06:41,669
On top of numerous accounts
of slander and assault,

1485
01:06:41,703 --> 01:06:43,805
Miss Winters may be facing
anywhere

1486
01:06:43,838 --> 01:06:46,206
from 5 to 10 years
in prison.

1487
01:06:46,240 --> 01:06:48,342
In related news, the reward has
been claimed

1488
01:06:48,375 --> 01:06:50,344
for the apprehension of the
Van Nuys

1489
01:06:50,377 --> 01:06:54,181
Vagrant Strangler by none other
than local hero George Jordan.

1490
01:06:54,616 --> 01:06:56,818
After this commercial break,
we're going to check in with

1491
01:06:56,851 --> 01:06:59,453
George, just to see how
he spent that reward money.

1492
01:07:00,755 --> 01:07:02,790
All right, man. We're live in
five here.

1493
01:07:03,290 --> 01:07:04,324
Man, this is so crazy.

1494
01:07:04,358 --> 01:07:06,260
You know, yesterday I was just
an unpaid intern,

1495
01:07:06,293 --> 01:07:07,762
living in my mom's basement.

1496
01:07:07,795 --> 01:07:10,130
Now, I'm a full blown news man
living in my mom's basement

1497
01:07:12,132 --> 01:07:13,333
just 'til I get on my
feet, though.

1498
01:07:13,367 --> 01:07:15,435
- Times are tough. Yeah.
- I know. It's a crazy town.

1499
01:07:15,469 --> 01:07:16,370
All right, mic check,

1500
01:07:16,403 --> 01:07:18,405
check one, check two, check one,
check two.

1501
01:07:18,438 --> 01:07:19,239
Check one, check two.

1502
01:07:19,273 --> 01:07:20,508
Come on, let's get this over
with.

1503
01:07:20,542 --> 01:07:21,509
Alright.

1504
01:07:33,721 --> 01:07:36,223
What, you gotta potty? You gotta
piss?

1505
01:07:36,256 --> 01:07:38,191
Okay, then, go. Go potty. Go
piss.

1506
01:07:41,629 --> 01:07:43,631
I'm not a fan of this color just
'cause

1507
01:07:43,665 --> 01:07:46,133
I feel like it's super
depressing, and I just, I want

1508
01:07:46,166 --> 01:07:48,168
people to come in and feel good
about themselves.

1509
01:07:48,201 --> 01:07:49,236
- Yeah, colorful!
- Y'know?

1510
01:07:49,269 --> 01:07:50,237
And that's what also makes me a
little bit nervous

1511
01:07:50,270 --> 01:07:52,172
about adding all these little
guys right here.

1512
01:07:52,205 --> 01:07:54,709
It just looks like a really big
bush.

1513
01:07:54,742 --> 01:07:55,810
You got this, buddy.

1514
01:07:56,711 --> 01:07:58,846
Yeah, they're here to see you.

1515
01:07:59,581 --> 01:08:01,315
You're on top.

1516
01:08:01,348 --> 01:08:02,850
You're George Jordan.

1517
01:08:12,594 --> 01:08:13,795
George Jordan.

1518
01:08:16,698 --> 01:08:18,733
Woah little lady.

1519
01:08:19,333 --> 01:08:20,735
I think you're a little mixed up
here.

1520
01:08:20,768 --> 01:08:22,637
This is the boys room.

1521
01:08:22,670 --> 01:08:25,238
No, but--
Yeah, you don't want to
go in there.

1522
01:08:25,506 --> 01:08:27,441
There's all kinds of gross
things. Here.

1523
01:08:27,474 --> 01:08:31,579
Little girls rooms right here.
See?

1524
01:08:32,446 --> 01:08:33,748
Have fun.

1525
01:08:38,653 --> 01:08:39,787
Hello!

1526
01:08:40,454 --> 01:08:42,890
George, my man. How you doing?

1527
01:08:42,924 --> 01:08:44,358
Good
- How's business?

1528
01:08:44,391 --> 01:08:46,326
Pizza, flowers, weird mix.

1529
01:08:46,360 --> 01:08:47,829
Yeah.

1530
01:08:47,862 --> 01:08:51,198
Okay, we're uh, we're live in
five, four, three

1531
01:08:54,569 --> 01:08:55,603
Right now?

1532
01:08:55,637 --> 01:08:56,938
Oh, thanks, Jimmy.

1533
01:08:56,971 --> 01:08:58,372
I'm here with George Jordan,

1534
01:08:58,405 --> 01:08:59,807
local celebrity and
business owner.

1535
01:08:59,841 --> 01:09:00,875
George.

1536
01:09:00,908 --> 01:09:03,443
How in God's earth
did you come up with this idea?

1537
01:09:03,477 --> 01:09:06,446
Hey, John. Well, after
everything that happened

1538
01:09:06,648 --> 01:09:07,749
and getting all that money,

1539
01:09:07,782 --> 01:09:09,517
I didn't know what to do
with myself.

1540
01:09:09,550 --> 01:09:11,351
I thought about running away.

1541
01:09:11,385 --> 01:09:13,721
I even thought about donating
all of it.

1542
01:09:13,755 --> 01:09:14,822
And then it came to me.

1543
01:09:14,856 --> 01:09:18,425
How can George Jordan
contribute to his community?

1544
01:09:19,594 --> 01:09:22,396
And that's when I thought of
delicious pizza and flowers.

1545
01:09:23,397 --> 01:09:25,499
Speaking of flowers, my
beautiful girlfriend

1546
01:09:25,533 --> 01:09:29,336
Kim can explain everything, as
she's the master--

1547
01:09:29,369 --> 01:09:30,571
Hey, asshole. Did you tell my
transgender child

1548
01:09:33,473 --> 01:09:34,809
they can't use the bathroom?

1549
01:09:34,842 --> 01:09:35,877
N-n-n-no, no, no.

1550
01:09:35,910 --> 01:09:38,412
I showed your little girl
where the girl's room--

1551
01:09:38,445 --> 01:09:42,382
Agh! He identifies as a man.

1552
01:09:42,416 --> 01:09:44,585
You privileged piece of shit.

1553
01:09:45,252 --> 01:09:46,554
Young child,

1554
01:09:46,587 --> 01:09:50,525
Did Mr. Jordan do something to
you?

1555
01:09:50,558 --> 01:09:54,494
He touched me and said I had to
go to the little girl's room.

1556
01:09:54,529 --> 01:09:55,630
He touched you.

1557
01:09:55,663 --> 01:09:56,964
You touched him.

1558
01:09:56,998 --> 01:09:58,231
- You touched him?
- No, no, no...

1559
01:09:58,265 --> 01:10:01,301
I will kick your ass from here
to Kansas, you piece of crap.

1560
01:10:01,769 --> 01:10:03,938
Mr. Jordan, is this true?

1561
01:10:03,971 --> 01:10:06,607
Are you transphobic, or do you
have some sort of specific

1562
01:10:06,641 --> 01:10:09,476
vendetta against this beautiful,
gender-bending creature of God?

1563
01:10:09,510 --> 01:10:10,511
No.

1564
01:10:12,279 --> 01:10:13,447
Fuck me. Right?

1565
01:10:13,480 --> 01:10:14,916
Fuck you.

1566
01:10:14,949 --> 01:10:15,950
Oh!
