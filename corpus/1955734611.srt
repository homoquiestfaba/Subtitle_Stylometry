1
00:01:36,965 --> 00:01:39,632
Mina and Elijah.

2
00:01:43,771 --> 00:01:45,972
Come on guys, the sun is
almost down, Daddy's serious.

3
00:02:17,005 --> 00:02:19,705
Daddy, daddy.

4
00:02:19,741 --> 00:02:21,941
- I got you.
- You found us.

5
00:02:21,976 --> 00:02:24,043
Hey, did you guys
hear me calling you?

6
00:02:24,078 --> 00:02:25,845
We're just playing.

7
00:02:27,782 --> 00:02:30,342
- Nuhyou made us run away.
- No, I didn't. -Elijah, come on, bud.

8
00:02:32,854 --> 00:02:34,687
Elijah!

9
00:03:03,885 --> 00:03:05,684
All right, come here, bud.

10
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:07,987
Come on, okay.

11
00:03:10,892 --> 00:03:15,928
Now, look, I know you're upset, okay,
but we talked about this, right?

12
00:03:18,833 --> 00:03:21,000
It's a little like football.

13
00:03:21,702 --> 00:03:23,736
I'm the team captain.

14
00:03:23,771 --> 00:03:27,673
We've all been training really
hard, now, it's just time, okay?

15
00:03:27,942 --> 00:03:30,576
It's time for us to go
play in the big game.

16
00:03:30,611 --> 00:03:32,711
But you've never
been to war before.

17
00:03:32,747 --> 00:03:36,048
Well, it's not
really a war, buddy.

18
00:03:36,084 --> 00:03:37,895
I'm just going over there
to go help some people.

19
00:03:37,919 --> 00:03:38,984
That's it.

20
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:40,853
Then you don't have to go.

21
00:03:40,888 --> 00:03:42,721
Soldiers only go to wars.

22
00:03:42,757 --> 00:03:44,857
Sometimes, they
go for peace, too.

23
00:03:45,093 --> 00:03:47,960
And those guys in my
platoon, those are my guys.

24
00:03:47,995 --> 00:03:50,062
You understand?

25
00:03:50,098 --> 00:03:53,799
They're my family, too, and daddy's got
to go over there and keep them safe.

26
00:03:55,369 --> 00:03:58,804
- You like them better than us.
- Hey, Elijah, no. -I hope you never come back.

27
00:04:00,641 --> 00:04:04,543
Hey, come on bud,
Elijah, hey, get back, hey.

28
00:04:05,012 --> 00:04:08,781
Let him go, let him go,
let him get it out.

29
00:04:11,586 --> 00:04:12,785
Talk to him in the morning.

30
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:16,689
It's okay, he'll be
okay, he'll be fine.

31
00:04:20,728 --> 00:04:22,862
Yeah, yeah.

32
00:04:38,613 --> 00:04:41,013
These two wanted to say goodbye.

33
00:04:43,618 --> 00:04:44,698
Your humble Knights, ma'am.

34
00:04:44,752 --> 00:04:46,585
God.

35
00:04:51,058 --> 00:04:53,759
Come on, you take
care out there.

36
00:04:55,763 --> 00:04:57,663
We'll watch out
for him, don't worry.

37
00:04:57,698 --> 00:04:59,031
Yeah.

38
00:04:59,066 --> 00:05:01,567
You guys got enough DVDs
to pass the time out there?

39
00:05:01,602 --> 00:05:04,537
This man will insist all
four seasons of<i> The Sopranos.</i>

40
00:05:04,572 --> 00:05:05,871
Dude, it's TV history.

41
00:05:05,907 --> 00:05:07,640
Stay safe out there, Tomas.

42
00:05:07,675 --> 00:05:08,707
I will.

43
00:05:08,743 --> 00:05:09,808
You better.

44
00:05:09,844 --> 00:05:12,611
Battalion mount up, all
units board to transport.

45
00:05:12,647 --> 00:05:14,880
I got to go.

46
00:05:16,017 --> 00:05:18,918
Come on, Lupe, I
got other people to hug too.

47
00:05:20,788 --> 00:05:21,921
Mom, what?

48
00:05:23,858 --> 00:05:26,058
I won't see you for a year,
mijo, I just wanna remember.

49
00:05:30,932 --> 00:05:32,965
I love you, little brother.

50
00:05:36,771 --> 00:05:40,839
- I love you, Tracie.
- Bye, mijo.

51
00:05:50,651 --> 00:05:52,718
- I'm gonna miss you so much.
- Yeah.

52
00:05:53,821 --> 00:05:55,688
You'll be back
before we know it.

53
00:06:36,931 --> 00:06:38,731
Mind your weapon, Guzman.

54
00:06:38,766 --> 00:06:39,965
Sorry, Sergeant B.

55
00:06:50,745 --> 00:06:52,811
Any news on our duty
assignment yet, sir?

56
00:06:52,847 --> 00:06:55,614
No, not yet.

57
00:06:56,017 --> 00:06:59,985
It'll be one of the Four R's
though, Rebuild, Restore.

58
00:07:00,021 --> 00:07:02,655
- Reuse, Recycle?
- That's right.

59
00:07:07,795 --> 00:07:10,596
How does a man do that,
sleep in this?

60
00:07:11,732 --> 00:07:12,831
Chen.

61
00:07:12,867 --> 00:07:15,834
Chen could sleep through
a nuclear explosion, sir.

62
00:07:22,843 --> 00:07:24,777
<i>1st Cavalry, starting
our decent.</i>

63
00:07:24,812 --> 00:07:27,980
Next stop, the great unknown.

64
00:07:28,983 --> 00:07:31,750
How are you feeling?

65
00:07:31,986 --> 00:07:36,955
- Good.
- Yeah? -You, sir?

66
00:07:40,861 --> 00:07:42,761
I feel ready.

67
00:08:21,769 --> 00:08:23,569
What, what should I do, sir?

68
00:08:23,604 --> 00:08:25,904
Just tap the horn and put
some muscle into it, Riddell.

69
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:26,972
They'll move, man.

70
00:08:29,777 --> 00:08:33,846
You got to let go of this polite Oregon
hippie driving, man, this is the Middle East.

71
00:08:33,881 --> 00:08:38,751
So we get to the meet, and in walks in this,
this huge dude with like a foot long beard.

72
00:08:39,854 --> 00:08:41,854
He look like, like
Hagrid from<i> Harry Potter.</i>

73
00:08:43,758 --> 00:08:47,559
And the Iraqis are like, Lieutenant,
this is our Chief of Security,

74
00:08:47,595 --> 00:08:53,632
so Hagrid comes up to me and he's, like,
"Hello, nice to meet you, I'm Chief Fahker."

75
00:08:54,769 --> 00:08:55,701
No.

76
00:08:55,736 --> 00:08:57,002
I swear to God.

77
00:08:57,037 --> 00:08:58,837
I'm, like, "I'm sorry,
Chief, Chief Fahker?"

78
00:08:58,873 --> 00:09:01,840
He's like,
"Yeah, Chief Monther Fahker."

79
00:09:02,610 --> 00:09:04,910
I cannot shake this man's
hand with a straight face.

80
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:07,913
- Whoa.
- Whoa, Ridell.

81
00:09:07,948 --> 00:09:10,616
You did that on
purpose, Monther Fahker.

82
00:09:10,918 --> 00:09:13,719
I swear I didn't, Sergeant.

83
00:09:13,754 --> 00:09:16,634
We're still gonna make it to rendezvous
point with the crew at this rate.

84
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:21,560
And how far away
are we, Riddell?

85
00:09:21,595 --> 00:09:25,664
Well, sir, I, I believe that we crossed
Route Aeros just a few blocks back.

86
00:09:27,568 --> 00:09:29,735
Like, a, a little,
little while back.

87
00:09:29,770 --> 00:09:31,670
In other words,
you have no idea?

88
00:09:31,705 --> 00:09:33,539
Yeah, I, I have no idea, sir.

89
00:09:33,574 --> 00:09:35,707
Lieutenant, I can
tell you where we are.

90
00:09:35,743 --> 00:09:39,611
No, no, no, I want Specialist
Riddell here to figure it out.

91
00:09:39,647 --> 00:09:42,614
- Sir, I.
- Fine, I will do it.

92
00:09:44,618 --> 00:09:47,920
The Army in its infinite wisdom has,
after all, provided us with these very

93
00:09:47,955 --> 00:09:49,988
excellent, hitech,
navigational systems.

94
00:09:51,926 --> 00:09:56,628
Sir, I'd like to note a
rooftop anomaly, nine o'clock.

95
00:09:58,966 --> 00:10:00,766
Are those, are those goats?

96
00:10:00,801 --> 00:10:02,768
I believe that's the case, sir.

97
00:10:02,803 --> 00:10:05,804
Jassim, why, why would they
put goats on their roof?

98
00:10:06,841 --> 00:10:09,675
Where else would one put
goats to keep them safe?

99
00:10:12,813 --> 00:10:15,013
Good, good point, Jassim.

100
00:10:15,049 --> 00:10:17,850
Good, good point.

101
00:10:17,885 --> 00:10:21,920
Okay, looks like we are at
Routes Fox and Florida, boys.

102
00:10:21,956 --> 00:10:23,755
We got to back this
thing up, Riddell.

103
00:10:23,791 --> 00:10:24,957
Wait, back it up?

104
00:10:24,992 --> 00:10:26,959
Don't shit your pants, Riddell.

105
00:11:01,996 --> 00:11:03,629
I'm gonna throw up.

106
00:11:05,032 --> 00:11:08,734
Specialist Wild, do not throw up
in my Victor, that's an order.

107
00:11:10,838 --> 00:11:12,604
I'll try, Sergeant B.

108
00:11:14,942 --> 00:11:16,775
Holy shit, yeah,
that's a goat's head.

109
00:11:21,749 --> 00:11:23,048
How is this warrior's work?

110
00:11:23,083 --> 00:11:25,584
Babysitting shit suckers.

111
00:11:25,619 --> 00:11:28,020
Well, welcome to
Sadr City, Jackson.

112
00:11:30,791 --> 00:11:34,026
Sergeant Hayhurst, advise the convoy,
we have a truck approaching from 6:00,

113
00:11:35,763 --> 00:11:37,896
another pep squad
for Mookie alSadr.

114
00:11:37,932 --> 00:11:39,698
Again?

115
00:11:39,733 --> 00:11:41,853
Maybe we'll get lucky this
time they'll try a driveby.

116
00:11:42,002 --> 00:11:44,036
Yeah, I doubt it.

117
00:11:44,071 --> 00:11:47,973
All Comanche Reds, this is Red Four, be advised
we've got a pep squad approaching, over.

118
00:11:50,744 --> 00:11:52,778
Muqtada, Muqtada,
Muqtada, Muqtada.

119
00:11:52,813 --> 00:11:54,012
Muqtada, Muqtada.

120
00:11:54,048 --> 00:11:57,049
All Comanche Reds, Red
One, be civil, over.

121
00:11:57,084 --> 00:11:59,051
Muqtada, Muqtada,
Muqtada, Muqtada.

122
00:11:59,086 --> 00:12:01,753
Muqtada, Muqtada.

123
00:12:01,789 --> 00:12:05,591
Down USA, down USA, down USA.

124
00:12:09,630 --> 00:12:11,863
Yeah, I'll give you USA.

125
00:12:22,943 --> 00:12:25,777
Pansyass pussies.

126
00:12:28,716 --> 00:12:30,782
Hey, Mookie alSadr.

127
00:12:30,818 --> 00:12:32,651
What's he so pissed
off at us for?

128
00:12:32,686 --> 00:12:35,053
Well, did we drop a bomb here
at some point or something?

129
00:12:35,089 --> 00:12:37,990
No, the Iraqis made this
place all by themselves.

130
00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:41,994
- So why follow that ugly mug?
- The family name.

131
00:12:43,731 --> 00:12:47,833
All sector's named after his dad, Grand
Ayatollah Saddam had wasted some years back.

132
00:12:49,203 --> 00:12:51,870
Mookie wants the streets for
himself, just wants us out of here.

133
00:12:53,374 --> 00:12:56,374
Yeah, whose gonna do that for him, those
guys, the big and bad Sadr Bureau?

134
00:12:57,111 --> 00:12:59,544
I think I want my money back.

135
00:13:02,983 --> 00:13:05,717
<i>Advisory to all units, all
outbound First Armored.</i>

136
00:13:05,753 --> 00:13:09,554
<i>Division elements must complete
loading by 17:45 hours.</i>

137
00:13:09,590 --> 00:13:12,724
<i>I say again, all outbound First Armored
Division elements must complete loading</i>

138
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:14,960
<i>by 17:45 hours.</i>

139
00:13:14,995 --> 00:13:17,596
<i>Transfer of authority is 18:00.</i>

140
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:23,035
All incoming patrols report quiet, a few
sporadic demonstrators still angry over

141
00:13:23,070 --> 00:13:26,638
the CPA shuttering alHawza, but
nothing like the marchers yesterday,

142
00:13:27,608 --> 00:13:29,775
looks to be finally be
calming down on that front.

143
00:13:29,810 --> 00:13:31,743
All right, good.

144
00:13:33,847 --> 00:13:36,826
Once this business of transition is over,
let's set meetings with all the local

145
00:13:36,850 --> 00:13:39,062
leaders and go to the status of our
projects, any security issues.

146
00:13:39,086 --> 00:13:40,986
What our men seeing so far?

147
00:13:41,021 --> 00:13:44,022
Main issue in the most
depressed areas remains theft.

148
00:13:44,058 --> 00:13:47,793
One of my patrols saw two men on Route Texas
yesterday trying to saw into a live main

149
00:13:47,828 --> 00:13:49,961
to steal a wire for copper.

150
00:13:49,997 --> 00:13:52,664
Well, that's industrious.

151
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:54,778
Also, we got generators at two local hospitals
failing because people are drilling

152
00:13:54,802 --> 00:13:56,968
into them, trying
to siphon fuel.

153
00:13:57,004 --> 00:14:00,572
Brother Randazzo,
what do you have?

154
00:14:00,607 --> 00:14:02,652
I'm still concerned with the
tone of Friday's sermons.

155
00:14:02,676 --> 00:14:05,010
Not just alSadr, but
other midlevel clerics.

156
00:14:05,045 --> 00:14:08,547
Marked uptick in antiAmerican sentiment,
more calls to end the occupation.

157
00:14:09,917 --> 00:14:12,984
I'm not surprised, alSadr
blames us for all the problems,

158
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:14,920
takes credit every time
the power flicks on.

159
00:14:14,955 --> 00:14:17,756
All we can do is
lead by example.

160
00:14:17,791 --> 00:14:20,759
- You think that'll do it, sir?
- I do.

161
00:14:21,028 --> 00:14:23,729
Think of it as a drum
beat, Brother Denomy.

162
00:14:23,764 --> 00:14:26,865
Every time we do something good
here, it's a beat of that drum.

163
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:31,737
Now, if we keep doing it, that beat is gonna
grow faster and stronger until eventually we

164
00:14:31,772 --> 00:14:35,540
are going to drown out all
those negative voices.

165
00:14:35,909 --> 00:14:39,010
I hope people are going to see
amazing things from us here.

166
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:46,051
And in less than one hour, this place
is officially ours for the year.

167
00:14:46,086 --> 00:14:49,621
Duties permitting, I'd like everyone present
for the transfer of authority, okay?

168
00:14:49,957 --> 00:14:53,592
- Yes, sir. - All our patrols back?
- Comanche Red is still out, sir.

169
00:14:53,994 --> 00:14:56,695
Aguero.

170
00:14:56,730 --> 00:15:00,499
- All right, still to come.
- I want candy, just give me. -Okay, okay, wait, wait.

171
00:15:00,701 --> 00:15:02,601
Okay, okay.

172
00:15:02,636 --> 00:15:03,847
All right, I think
I got some candy.

173
00:15:03,871 --> 00:15:05,737
Okay, relax.

174
00:15:08,909 --> 00:15:11,643
It's for you, it's for you,
he's going in my pocket.

175
00:15:12,746 --> 00:15:14,012
Okay, okay, that's it.

176
00:15:14,047 --> 00:15:16,715
Sir, sir, sir.

177
00:15:25,058 --> 00:15:28,627
Guzman, doc, come here a minute.

178
00:15:32,599 --> 00:15:34,733
What's up?

179
00:15:34,768 --> 00:15:36,802
See what you can do about this.

180
00:15:36,837 --> 00:15:38,477
Jassim, let him know
we're gonna help him.

181
00:15:42,943 --> 00:15:46,611
He's a tough kid, guess out
here he's got to be?

182
00:15:46,647 --> 00:15:48,207
He is gonna need to
see a doctor though.

183
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:54,986
What these?

184
00:15:55,022 --> 00:15:58,890
It's widely believed here
they have XRay vision.

185
00:15:58,926 --> 00:16:00,959
- This, the sunglasses?
- Yeah.

186
00:16:01,829 --> 00:16:03,829
You want them, ask him
if he want, you want them?

187
00:16:05,566 --> 00:16:06,731
Yeah?

188
00:16:06,767 --> 00:16:08,800
Yeah, yeah, he wants it,
he wants it.

189
00:16:09,903 --> 00:16:13,705
Let's see, pull back?

190
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:15,740
Do you think you
could do it, Wild?

191
00:16:15,776 --> 00:16:17,843
- Do what?
- Shoot a kid.

192
00:16:17,878 --> 00:16:19,911
If it came to that.

193
00:16:19,947 --> 00:16:22,881
I don't know man,
hope I never have to.

194
00:16:24,685 --> 00:16:25,884
No matter what?

195
00:16:25,919 --> 00:16:26,818
You'd let one of them
put a bullet in you?

196
00:16:26,854 --> 00:16:28,553
Shut up.

197
00:16:28,589 --> 00:16:31,523
Something's happening.

198
00:16:31,959 --> 00:16:35,560
- Sir.
- What? -Tanker crew.

199
00:16:36,063 --> 00:16:38,797
Hey, son of a bitch.

200
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:41,900
All Comanche Reds, remount.

201
00:16:41,935 --> 00:16:43,768
Come on now, go.

202
00:16:43,804 --> 00:16:44,804
Let's go.

203
00:16:44,838 --> 00:16:45,915
What do you think happened, sir?

204
00:16:45,939 --> 00:16:47,606
I don't know, man.

205
00:16:47,641 --> 00:16:48,874
Something spooked them.

206
00:16:48,909 --> 00:16:51,810
- Sir, everybody's in.
- Riddell, go.

207
00:17:44,757 --> 00:17:45,789
Are you nervous?

208
00:17:45,825 --> 00:17:47,458
A little.

209
00:17:47,493 --> 00:17:49,560
Don't be,
it's a quick introduction.

210
00:17:51,597 --> 00:17:53,497
Good Palm Sunday.

211
00:18:01,407 --> 00:18:03,607
Good Palm Sunday
morning, everyone.

212
00:18:03,643 --> 00:18:06,510
I'm LeAnn Volesky, I'm one of the
Family Readiness leaders here on base.

213
00:18:08,514 --> 00:18:11,749
Just a quick announcement, we are
collecting supplies for care packages to be

214
00:18:11,784 --> 00:18:14,485
sent over to Iraq.

215
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:17,788
I also wanted to introduce Gina Denomy,
one of our new Care Team leaders.

216
00:18:22,828 --> 00:18:24,795
Thank you.

217
00:18:25,765 --> 00:18:29,366
Hello, I am Gina,

218
00:18:31,437 --> 00:18:35,806
well, I just really like to say that I very
much look forward to working with all of you.

219
00:18:38,611 --> 00:18:41,578
And this is Merrick.

220
00:18:42,715 --> 00:18:44,748
Thank you.

221
00:18:48,454 --> 00:18:50,621
Deployments can be hard
in ways you don't expect,

222
00:18:52,458 --> 00:18:53,902
always remember that
you're not alone.

223
00:18:53,926 --> 00:18:56,493
Family Readiness is family.

224
00:18:56,529 --> 00:18:59,730
There is no rank among us here,
flyers in the back have our numbers.

225
00:19:00,733 --> 00:19:01,799
Call us, day or night.

226
00:19:01,834 --> 00:19:04,501
We're here for you.

227
00:19:08,607 --> 00:19:11,475
Thank you, LeAnn, very much.

228
00:19:11,510 --> 00:19:13,377
I'd like to begin
with a word of prayer.

229
00:19:14,780 --> 00:19:17,348
Elijah, come on, Elijah.

230
00:19:18,517 --> 00:19:19,817
Go away.

231
00:19:20,586 --> 00:19:26,657
- Please.
- Get up, Elijah. -So, can we talk?

232
00:19:28,427 --> 00:19:30,761
I'm not hungry.

233
00:19:30,796 --> 00:19:34,365
What if breakfast was waffles?

234
00:19:35,768 --> 00:19:37,768
We could go out.

235
00:19:37,803 --> 00:19:40,704
In fact, we have to go out.

236
00:19:40,906 --> 00:19:43,640
Do you remember what today is?

237
00:19:43,676 --> 00:19:45,809
Doesn't the gang have
a mystery to solve?

238
00:19:45,845 --> 00:19:47,678
It's<i> Scooby Doo</i> day!

239
00:19:48,748 --> 00:19:50,625
Okay, hey, but you have
to be ready in 10 minutes.

240
00:19:50,649 --> 00:19:51,782
Race you.

241
00:19:52,551 --> 00:19:55,386
I wanna see those teeth brushed.

242
00:20:17,877 --> 00:20:19,810
What the hell?

243
00:20:19,845 --> 00:20:23,881
You should've seen
your face, your face.

244
00:20:25,618 --> 00:20:27,684
You're an asshole, Martin.

245
00:20:28,621 --> 00:20:29,720
What's going on?

246
00:20:29,755 --> 00:20:32,556
That, yo, someone
get that thing.

247
00:20:32,591 --> 00:20:37,561
I'm on it, bro.

248
00:20:37,596 --> 00:20:39,463
Shit, it went in, man.

249
00:20:39,498 --> 00:20:40,898
No, man, no.

250
00:20:40,933 --> 00:20:42,733
I got this, I got this.

251
00:20:43,536 --> 00:20:44,713
Yo, what're you doing, Young?

252
00:20:44,737 --> 00:20:46,537
Get a knife or something.

253
00:20:46,572 --> 00:20:47,738
Hell, take my rifle.

254
00:20:47,773 --> 00:20:49,206
It's all right.

255
00:20:52,778 --> 00:20:54,611
All right, you see
the size of that thing?

256
00:20:54,647 --> 00:20:55,846
Martin, I'm gonna kill you.

257
00:20:55,881 --> 00:20:57,815
Come on, soldiers,
it's just a baby.

258
00:20:57,850 --> 00:20:59,817
- That's a baby?
- It's your new best friend.

259
00:21:00,786 --> 00:21:02,753
Yow, it's just a
camel spider, man.

260
00:21:02,788 --> 00:21:04,822
They don't even bite, I
wouldn't do you like that.

261
00:21:04,857 --> 00:21:07,624
It's actually a
whiptail scorpion.

262
00:21:07,660 --> 00:21:09,626
Yeah, they're harmless.

263
00:21:09,662 --> 00:21:11,706
You put that thing on me, you
don't even know what it was?

264
00:21:11,730 --> 00:21:14,765
- I thought it was.
- Asshole. -All right, I'm sorry, holmes.

265
00:21:19,905 --> 00:21:22,739
Yo, what're you doing here, anyway
ain't you supposed to be on patrol?

266
00:21:22,775 --> 00:21:24,575
Damn man, I missed the rollout.

267
00:21:24,610 --> 00:21:26,643
"Saddam's Revenge"
got me on the toilet.

268
00:21:28,547 --> 00:21:29,858
Maybe because you ate
one of these things.

269
00:21:29,882 --> 00:21:31,448
What the hell is
this supposed to be?

270
00:21:31,484 --> 00:21:32,616
Is this chicken?

271
00:21:32,651 --> 00:21:33,784
Damned if I know.

272
00:21:33,819 --> 00:21:34,863
Anybody got any hot
sauce or something?

273
00:21:34,887 --> 00:21:36,753
Arsiaga.

274
00:21:37,590 --> 00:21:39,456
Man, if you don't
want that, I'll eat it.

275
00:21:39,492 --> 00:21:40,691
You like this shit?

276
00:21:40,726 --> 00:21:42,526
Hey, we're in a war zone, Garza.

277
00:21:42,561 --> 00:21:43,494
Crazy.

278
00:21:43,529 --> 00:21:45,796
Thought you wanted Afghanistan.

279
00:21:45,831 --> 00:21:47,798
Yeah, I did, this
is the war I got.

280
00:21:52,571 --> 00:21:53,670
What do you know about it?

281
00:21:57,576 --> 00:21:59,843
War.

282
00:22:00,679 --> 00:22:03,413
You ever even been shot at?

283
00:22:04,617 --> 00:22:07,518
- I have.
- I'm not asking you, Specialist.

284
00:22:08,621 --> 00:22:10,521
I'm asking PFC Young.

285
00:22:10,556 --> 00:22:13,390
- That's not what I.
- That's not what?

286
00:22:14,627 --> 00:22:17,461
No Staff Sergeant, I
have never been shot at.

287
00:22:17,496 --> 00:22:19,763
You ever fired your
weapon at a human being?

288
00:22:19,798 --> 00:22:21,632
No Staff Sergeant.

289
00:22:21,667 --> 00:22:24,568
Well, then do me a
favor and shut up.

290
00:22:26,872 --> 00:22:30,841
Ain't nothing out there like
you think it is, nothing.

291
00:22:30,876 --> 00:22:34,878
You know, ain't no training gonna prepare
you, there's no glory out there, no heroes,

292
00:22:36,515 --> 00:22:40,584
it's just death and rot.

293
00:22:57,670 --> 00:22:59,836
Close eye on our six.

294
00:23:05,544 --> 00:23:06,855
He says you have to
let them go, they've quit.

295
00:23:06,879 --> 00:23:07,844
All of them.

296
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:09,413
Why?

297
00:23:21,527 --> 00:23:25,429
He says a man came over at the last pump
site and told them they'd be killed,

298
00:23:26,865 --> 00:23:29,566
them and their families that anyone
working for the Coalition is now

299
00:23:29,602 --> 00:23:30,734
an enemy of AISadr.

300
00:23:30,769 --> 00:23:31,735
Okay, Jassim, ask him.

301
00:23:31,770 --> 00:23:35,606
Hold up, sir, he
left something out.

302
00:23:41,947 --> 00:23:44,881
Targets, infidels.

303
00:23:47,519 --> 00:23:49,753
So you've missed
that part, Jassim?

304
00:23:49,788 --> 00:23:53,423
He said he and his men are tired of having
targets on their backs with the infidels.

305
00:23:54,727 --> 00:23:55,859
I was trying to be polite.

306
00:23:55,894 --> 00:23:58,428
How about do your job?

307
00:24:11,710 --> 00:24:16,780
Okay Jassim, tell this man he doesn't
have to be afraid and our men our

308
00:24:16,815 --> 00:24:18,715
troops will protect him.

309
00:24:26,191 --> 00:24:29,493
He says, "You Americans say that,
but how will you protect us?"

310
00:24:40,539 --> 00:24:43,640
"How will you protect us and our
families tonight when you're back safe"

311
00:24:43,676 --> 00:24:45,842
behind your base walls?

312
00:24:45,878 --> 00:24:50,480
"You can't and we have to live here after
you are gone." What do you wanna do, sir?

313
00:24:52,584 --> 00:24:54,618
Let them go.

314
00:25:11,804 --> 00:25:13,603
Yes, sir.

315
00:25:13,639 --> 00:25:14,883
That's what they said, that they and
their families would be killed,

316
00:25:14,907 --> 00:25:19,576
that anyone working for us now
was AISadr's enemy, over.

317
00:25:19,611 --> 00:25:21,778
Copy that, Red One.

318
00:25:21,814 --> 00:25:25,449
Swing by AISadr Bureau on your way back,
just make sure nothing's brewing, over.

319
00:25:25,918 --> 00:25:28,785
<i>Copy that, Comanche Six, over.</i>

320
00:25:28,821 --> 00:25:32,556
Comanche Six out.

321
00:25:36,795 --> 00:25:38,628
It looks quiet.

322
00:25:43,535 --> 00:25:46,703
All right, Riddell, this
is Delta, turn left here.

323
00:25:46,739 --> 00:25:49,706
AISadr Bureau's
just up the road.

324
00:26:07,726 --> 00:26:09,637
Sir, should we get some guys
together for a game tonight?

325
00:26:09,661 --> 00:26:12,496
God yes please.

326
00:26:12,531 --> 00:26:13,797
Jassim, you interested?

327
00:26:13,832 --> 00:26:18,635
- What is this?
- What's DND?

328
00:26:18,670 --> 00:26:24,474
- Dungeons & Dragons.
- What's Dungeons & Dragons? -You'll see.

329
00:26:38,557 --> 00:26:40,424
Sergeant, AK, 9:00.

330
00:26:40,459 --> 00:26:41,825
Whip us around.

331
00:26:43,929 --> 00:26:45,662
Red One, this is Red Four.

332
00:26:45,697 --> 00:26:48,832
We got a potential
hostile with an AK, over.

333
00:26:54,505 --> 00:26:55,505
Hey.

334
00:26:58,409 --> 00:26:59,687
Just listen to what I'm saying!

335
00:26:59,711 --> 00:27:02,645
- Let me take over, Sergeant.
- Please.

336
00:27:05,750 --> 00:27:07,516
Jassim, please translate.

337
00:27:07,552 --> 00:27:09,652
I'm Lieutenant Shane Aguero
of the First Cavalry.

338
00:27:13,858 --> 00:27:16,525
Coalition rules prohibit
public possession of weapons.

339
00:27:16,561 --> 00:27:19,361
These men must disarm and hand over
their rifles, they must do so, now.

340
00:27:29,807 --> 00:27:34,577
He, he says the weapons are, um,
registered and permitted to protect the.

341
00:27:34,612 --> 00:27:35,711
Mosque and the Imam.

342
00:27:35,747 --> 00:27:37,780
Who are they affiliated with?

343
00:27:37,815 --> 00:27:39,682
Sadr Bureau, KDP, SCIRI?

344
00:27:54,832 --> 00:27:57,600
Have your men take
custody of the weapons.

345
00:28:02,407 --> 00:28:03,784
All right, come on,
let's call this in.

346
00:28:03,808 --> 00:28:05,441
Sergeant, you're with me.

347
00:28:05,476 --> 00:28:07,643
Yup.

348
00:28:17,655 --> 00:28:20,356
Come on, come on, move it.

349
00:28:24,729 --> 00:28:28,497
Lancer Mike, Comanche Red One, I need
Comanche Six or Lancer Six, over.

350
00:28:33,705 --> 00:28:35,638
Red One, this is
Lancer Six, go ahead, over.

351
00:28:37,041 --> 00:28:39,486
Lancer Six, we have a group of
armed men at the Mosque on Delta,

352
00:28:39,510 --> 00:28:42,623
south of the Sadr Bureau, they said that
they're SCIRI, permitted to carry to protect

353
00:28:42,647 --> 00:28:43,846
the Mosque.

354
00:28:43,881 --> 00:28:45,815
We have taken custody
of their weapons.

355
00:28:45,850 --> 00:28:48,484
What is your guidance, over?

356
00:28:48,519 --> 00:28:50,419
Is that true?

357
00:28:50,455 --> 00:28:51,832
There is a Coalition rule
that allows for armed guards

358
00:28:51,856 --> 00:28:54,423
inside Mosque perimeters.

359
00:28:54,459 --> 00:28:57,293
Enacted after a string
of Sunni attacks.

360
00:28:57,762 --> 00:29:00,396
Red One, do you see any evidence
of hostile intent, over?

361
00:29:04,635 --> 00:29:06,502
Negative Lancer Six, over.

362
00:29:06,537 --> 00:29:09,572
Sir, the guy was on the street.

363
00:29:09,607 --> 00:29:13,609
Lancer Six, Red Four reports one of the men
was on the street with his weapon, over.

364
00:29:16,447 --> 00:29:17,687
No evidence of hostile intent.

365
00:29:17,715 --> 00:29:20,449
Let's try to keep the peace.

366
00:29:20,485 --> 00:29:22,451
Red One, return the weapons.

367
00:29:22,487 --> 00:29:25,599
Advise the guards a proper adherence to the
rules or we will have to confiscate them

368
00:29:25,623 --> 00:29:28,424
and then return to base, over.

369
00:29:28,459 --> 00:29:30,493
Roger that, Lancer Six, over.

370
00:29:33,598 --> 00:29:35,731
All right, give them back.

371
00:29:41,806 --> 00:29:45,708
Jassim, tell them our mistake but
they've got to stick to the rules.

372
00:29:46,744 --> 00:29:49,512
No weapons outside of the
Mosque or we will take them.

373
00:30:03,427 --> 00:30:06,395
All right, all
Comanche Reds, remount.

374
00:30:26,517 --> 00:30:27,850
This is bullshit.

375
00:30:46,771 --> 00:30:48,871
Staff Sergeant Miltenberger?

376
00:30:50,641 --> 00:30:52,875
They opened up the phones,
don't you wanna call home?

377
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:58,581
I said everything
I needed to before I left.

378
00:31:02,620 --> 00:31:04,653
All right then.

379
00:31:23,774 --> 00:31:25,774
From the Gospel
of Matthew, Chapter 21.

380
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:32,514
As they approached Jerusalem and came
to Bethphage on the Mount of Olives,

381
00:31:32,550 --> 00:31:35,584
Jesus sent two disciples
saying to them.

382
00:31:36,654 --> 00:31:37,853
Israel?

383
00:31:37,889 --> 00:31:40,522
Baby, sweetie.

384
00:31:40,558 --> 00:31:41,490
I can't believe it's you.

385
00:31:41,525 --> 00:31:43,392
I'm in church, baby.

386
00:31:43,861 --> 00:31:45,861
Untie them and bring them to me.

387
00:31:45,897 --> 00:31:47,496
If anyone ask anything.

388
00:31:47,531 --> 00:31:48,797
Are you okay?

389
00:31:48,833 --> 00:31:50,532
I've been so worried.

390
00:31:50,568 --> 00:31:52,735
You always worry too much, babe.

391
00:31:52,770 --> 00:31:54,803
They just opened up the phones.

392
00:31:54,839 --> 00:31:56,505
Got Arsiaga here, too.

393
00:31:56,540 --> 00:31:58,674
Hey, Lupe.

394
00:31:58,709 --> 00:32:01,455
Hey listen, um, I don't got a lot of time
but I, I wanted to tell you about this

395
00:32:01,479 --> 00:32:03,612
dream I had last night,
it was amazing Lupe.

396
00:32:05,750 --> 00:32:10,586
And I, in it, I, I was already back and we
were all together, just, just hugging and,

397
00:32:11,689 --> 00:32:13,722
and kissing, and it
was so real, baby.

398
00:32:14,759 --> 00:32:17,393
I, I woke up hugging my rugsack.

399
00:32:19,130 --> 00:32:22,490
Lucky Arsiaga wasn't next to me or he would've
woken up to me trying to hump his ass.

400
00:32:24,502 --> 00:32:25,768
I love you so much, baby.

401
00:32:25,803 --> 00:32:28,404
But don't worry, you hear me?

402
00:32:28,439 --> 00:32:30,639
We're gonna be fine.

403
00:32:30,675 --> 00:32:34,543
Sergeant Chen, thought you'd be
joining us for D&D after chow?

404
00:32:34,812 --> 00:32:37,446
Never again sir, definitely not.

405
00:32:37,481 --> 00:32:38,892
Come on sir, who'd
Sergeant Chen even be?

406
00:32:38,916 --> 00:32:41,550
He could be a bard.

407
00:32:53,731 --> 00:32:56,365
Guys!

408
00:33:12,650 --> 00:33:15,351
Where the hell is everyone?

409
00:33:19,824 --> 00:33:21,824
Whoa, whoa, listen.

410
00:33:22,526 --> 00:33:23,759
Was that.

411
00:33:27,431 --> 00:33:28,675
Comanche Reds, this is Red Four.

412
00:33:28,699 --> 00:33:29,865
We have contact.

413
00:33:29,900 --> 00:33:31,433
Looks like a lone shooter.

414
00:33:31,469 --> 00:33:33,402
Moving to isolate, over.

415
00:33:33,437 --> 00:33:36,605
All Comanche Reds, Red One, halt and
move to Red Four's position, over.

416
00:33:38,476 --> 00:33:39,408
Come on, Riddell.

417
00:33:39,443 --> 00:33:40,443
Get us back there.

418
00:33:40,478 --> 00:33:42,678
Come on, go, go.

419
00:33:58,596 --> 00:34:00,429
Anyone see the shooter?

420
00:34:00,464 --> 00:34:03,332
Negative.

421
00:34:07,538 --> 00:34:09,471
Lancer Mike, this
is Comanche Red One.

422
00:34:09,507 --> 00:34:10,839
We have received fire.

423
00:34:10,875 --> 00:34:13,609
Route Delta, just south
of the Sadr Bureau, over.

424
00:34:14,545 --> 00:34:16,812
Red One, Comanche Six,
what type of fire, over?

425
00:34:16,847 --> 00:34:18,781
Comanche Six, unclear, over.

426
00:34:25,689 --> 00:34:27,456
Ambush.

427
00:34:38,469 --> 00:34:39,768
All Comanche Reds, remount.

428
00:34:39,804 --> 00:34:41,837
Get back in your vehicles, over.

429
00:35:05,529 --> 00:35:08,530
My plate caught them,
my plate caught them.

430
00:35:08,566 --> 00:35:10,432
Get in, everybody remount.

431
00:35:11,869 --> 00:35:13,535
Comanche Six, this is Red One.

432
00:35:13,571 --> 00:35:15,437
We have renewed contact, over.

433
00:35:15,473 --> 00:35:17,539
Red One, how heavy
is the contact, over?

434
00:35:17,575 --> 00:35:18,507
What?

435
00:35:18,542 --> 00:35:20,609
How heavy is your contact, over?

436
00:35:20,644 --> 00:35:21,710
Really damn heavy.

437
00:35:21,745 --> 00:35:23,645
We're in a complex ambush.

438
00:35:30,821 --> 00:35:31,687
Everyone's in.

439
00:35:31,722 --> 00:35:32,788
Go, Riddell.

440
00:35:32,823 --> 00:35:34,823
Come on, go, go.

441
00:36:08,592 --> 00:36:10,726
Man.

442
00:36:22,406 --> 00:36:24,706
- Sir?
- Punch us through.

443
00:36:24,742 --> 00:36:26,675
- You sure?
- Yes.

444
00:36:27,778 --> 00:36:28,778
Chen, inside now.

445
00:36:36,562 --> 00:36:37,528
Everybody okay?

446
00:36:37,563 --> 00:36:38,762
Yeah.

447
00:36:40,933 --> 00:36:44,601
Man, sir, there's
no one following.

448
00:36:45,571 --> 00:36:46,870
Shit.

449
00:36:46,906 --> 00:36:48,439
I don't see them either.

450
00:36:48,474 --> 00:36:49,484
Stop the vehicle, Riddell.

451
00:36:49,508 --> 00:36:50,708
Stop, stop, stop.

452
00:36:52,645 --> 00:36:53,789
All Comanche Reds,
this is Red One.

453
00:36:53,813 --> 00:36:55,779
Do you copy, over?

454
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:02,553
All Comanche Reds, come in.

455
00:37:08,527 --> 00:37:09,793
You don't see them?

456
00:37:09,829 --> 00:37:11,795
No, sir.

457
00:37:20,573 --> 00:37:22,806
- Turn us around.
- What?

458
00:37:23,642 --> 00:37:25,509
Two of those Victors
have no armor, Riddell.

459
00:37:25,544 --> 00:37:28,445
Come on, we got
to get back fast.

460
00:38:02,648 --> 00:38:04,715
Anyone got a visual?

461
00:38:05,418 --> 00:38:08,619
Negative, sir.

462
00:38:29,708 --> 00:38:32,676
- What the hell happened here?
- Looks like RPG hits.

463
00:38:35,915 --> 00:38:37,514
Red Four, this is Red One.

464
00:38:37,550 --> 00:38:39,583
What the hell is going on, over?

465
00:38:43,823 --> 00:38:45,689
Red Four, come in.

466
00:38:45,724 --> 00:38:47,691
Their antennas
must've got shot up.

467
00:38:47,726 --> 00:38:49,827
Riddell, stop here.

468
00:38:55,634 --> 00:38:56,733
Wait for me here.

469
00:38:56,769 --> 00:38:58,402
What?

470
00:38:58,437 --> 00:39:00,471
Wait, sir, where are you going?

471
00:39:13,619 --> 00:39:15,686
Let's go, let's go, floor it.

472
00:39:20,526 --> 00:39:22,526
- Perry, you okay?
- Yes, sir.

473
00:39:23,863 --> 00:39:27,431
- Punch it.
- Bourquin, what is going on? -Enemy fired two RPGs.

474
00:39:28,767 --> 00:39:30,879
Perry evaded but his engine
and windshields got blown out.

475
00:39:30,903 --> 00:39:32,803
Three hit a barricade
and got pinned down.

476
00:39:32,838 --> 00:39:35,439
Taylor, punch it again.

477
00:39:35,474 --> 00:39:37,841
Come on, are you kidding me?

478
00:39:38,744 --> 00:39:40,711
Son of a bitch.

479
00:39:40,746 --> 00:39:43,380
Sir, these two Vics
are dead light.

480
00:39:43,682 --> 00:39:45,716
We got to get the hell
off of this street.

481
00:39:45,751 --> 00:39:47,684
We cannot fit 19 men
inside the two Victors.

482
00:39:47,720 --> 00:39:49,586
We need to find shelter.

483
00:39:51,457 --> 00:39:53,657
All right, empty out the
equipment from the two Victors.

484
00:39:53,926 --> 00:39:55,526
Zout the radios.

485
00:39:55,561 --> 00:39:57,427
Roger that, two
and three dismount.

486
00:40:07,706 --> 00:40:11,408
- Shit.
- We leaving now? -Chen?

487
00:40:18,717 --> 00:40:19,750
Where's he hit?

488
00:40:19,785 --> 00:40:21,485
- I don't know.
- Is he okay?

489
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:22,586
How bad is it?

490
00:40:22,621 --> 00:40:24,855
It's bad, he's not breathing.

491
00:40:27,593 --> 00:40:30,494
Jassim, Jassim.

492
00:40:31,630 --> 00:40:32,696
Do you know CPR?

493
00:40:32,731 --> 00:40:33,830
- Yes.
- Start.

494
00:40:33,866 --> 00:40:36,433
Fisk, on the .50 cal,
return fire.

495
00:40:37,703 --> 00:40:39,770
Comanche Six, this is Red One.

496
00:40:39,805 --> 00:40:41,872
Fisk.

497
00:40:43,876 --> 00:40:46,710
Comanche Six, this is Red One.

498
00:40:46,745 --> 00:40:49,546
We need QRF support
and immediate evac.

499
00:40:49,582 --> 00:40:51,515
We have an urgent surgical,
two vehicles down.

500
00:40:51,550 --> 00:40:53,483
I repeat, we need
immediate evac, over.

501
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:56,887
Red One, Comanche Six,

502
00:40:56,922 --> 00:40:59,389
find a secure defensive position
and wait for extraction.

503
00:40:59,592 --> 00:41:00,691
We're coming, over.

504
00:41:03,796 --> 00:41:05,829
Be ready to move.

505
00:41:08,901 --> 00:41:10,867
Hey, Red Platoon, we are moving.

506
00:41:10,903 --> 00:41:12,502
Time, now.

507
00:41:12,538 --> 00:41:14,638
Get in the cover of your
armored Victors, come on.

508
00:41:14,873 --> 00:41:16,673
Hey, Guzman, look at me.

509
00:41:16,709 --> 00:41:17,886
Hand that stuff off
to somebody else.

510
00:41:17,910 --> 00:41:19,509
Chen's been hit.

511
00:41:19,545 --> 00:41:20,844
- What?
- Understand?

512
00:41:20,879 --> 00:41:22,613
Go.

513
00:41:22,648 --> 00:41:23,880
Bring it in, let's go.

514
00:41:23,916 --> 00:41:25,616
Go, go, go, come on, hurry.

515
00:41:25,651 --> 00:41:28,552
- Sir.
- How bad is it? -I don't know.

516
00:41:28,587 --> 00:41:30,520
All right, look, we
got to move, okay?

517
00:41:30,556 --> 00:41:31,722
Let's go.

518
00:41:36,662 --> 00:41:37,694
Hey!

519
00:41:50,843 --> 00:41:53,644
You.

520
00:42:19,772 --> 00:42:21,438
Cover across.

521
00:42:32,918 --> 00:42:35,452
Sergeant, alley.

522
00:42:59,678 --> 00:43:01,445
Are you sure you're not worried?

523
00:43:01,480 --> 00:43:04,715
There has only been one incident in
the entire city in the last year.

524
00:43:04,750 --> 00:43:06,783
We're not even bringing
the heavy armor.

525
00:43:06,819 --> 00:43:08,830
If there's a gun going off of there,
it's probably just some fool celebrating

526
00:43:08,854 --> 00:43:10,754
a Cowboys game.

527
00:43:10,789 --> 00:43:13,623
Well, it never hurts
to be extra sure.

528
00:43:15,794 --> 00:43:18,862
- An amulet of magical armor?
- It's the most important one.

529
00:43:22,701 --> 00:43:26,670
Rogers, give me two
above the cross, go.

530
00:43:33,479 --> 00:43:36,680
- Sergeant. - Slow down, Danny.
- Sergeant, that rooftop.

531
00:43:37,549 --> 00:43:39,816
Roger that.

532
00:43:39,852 --> 00:43:40,852
Cover across.

533
00:43:40,886 --> 00:43:44,488
Watch these doors.

534
00:43:52,965 --> 00:43:54,664
What is their current position?

535
00:43:54,700 --> 00:43:55,866
Unknown, sir.

536
00:43:55,901 --> 00:43:57,601
What?

537
00:43:57,636 --> 00:43:58,847
The trackers aren't active yet.

538
00:43:58,871 --> 00:44:01,838
Computer is still connected
to the outgoing unit.

539
00:44:02,808 --> 00:44:05,742
How the hell are
we gonna find them?

540
00:45:22,788 --> 00:45:25,455
We need some IVs.

541
00:45:46,778 --> 00:45:48,678
Alex, it's time for breakfast.

542
00:45:49,781 --> 00:45:52,415
I'm not eating unless
it's chocolate pancakes.

543
00:45:55,787 --> 00:45:59,422
Alex, I'm counting to three.

544
00:45:59,458 --> 00:46:04,794
One, two, two and a half.

545
00:46:10,636 --> 00:46:13,670
- We have a Christmas tree?
- Yes, we do. -But it's not Christmas.

546
00:46:14,740 --> 00:46:16,506
That's true.

547
00:46:16,542 --> 00:46:18,520
But since I'm not gonna be
here for Christmas this year,

548
00:46:18,544 --> 00:46:20,577
I thought maybe we
could celebrate early.

549
00:46:20,612 --> 00:46:21,811
What do you think?

550
00:46:21,847 --> 00:46:23,446
Do you want your
present now or later?

551
00:46:23,482 --> 00:46:25,382
Now, now, now.

552
00:46:32,624 --> 00:46:34,658
No way, Mom, look.

553
00:46:34,693 --> 00:46:35,859
My gosh, more cars.

554
00:46:35,894 --> 00:46:37,694
That's just what you need.

555
00:46:37,729 --> 00:46:39,529
What do you say to your daddy?

556
00:46:39,565 --> 00:46:41,431
Thanks, dad.

557
00:46:41,466 --> 00:46:43,466
Merry Christmas, son.

558
00:46:44,536 --> 00:46:45,780
Do you wanna play cars with me?

559
00:46:45,804 --> 00:46:47,871
Not now sweetheart,
how about after we eat?

560
00:46:47,906 --> 00:46:49,773
All right, you heard
your mom, let's go.

561
00:46:51,877 --> 00:46:54,377
Wow, this looks incredible, hon.

562
00:46:54,680 --> 00:46:56,513
Thank you.

563
00:46:57,516 --> 00:46:59,516
Chocolate, my favorite.

564
00:46:59,551 --> 00:47:02,419
It's your daddy's favorite, too.

565
00:47:03,722 --> 00:47:05,822
Alex, would you like to
say grace this morning?

566
00:47:05,857 --> 00:47:10,694
Um, okay, dear Lord, thank you
for the food we're about to eat.

567
00:47:12,631 --> 00:47:15,699
Please watch over my
daddy when he's in Iraq.

568
00:47:15,734 --> 00:47:19,469
Don't let him get hurt by the bad
guys or fall in a hole and get lost.

569
00:47:20,539 --> 00:47:23,540
Please keep him safe from
scorpions and big bears.

570
00:47:23,575 --> 00:47:25,553
Alex, I don't think there
are any big bears in Iraq.

571
00:47:25,577 --> 00:47:27,510
Mom, I wasn't done.

572
00:47:27,546 --> 00:47:29,579
I'm sorry, so on.

573
00:47:29,615 --> 00:47:33,383
Please protect my daddy from small
bears and medium bears, too.

574
00:47:33,852 --> 00:47:36,786
Don't let him break
his arm or his leg.

575
00:47:36,822 --> 00:47:39,789
Don't let him get blown
away by a tornado.

576
00:47:44,630 --> 00:47:46,529
Took the car in
for an oil change.

577
00:47:46,565 --> 00:47:49,599
It should be good for a while.

578
00:47:49,935 --> 00:47:52,480
Did I tell you that Alex offered to
mow the lawn while you were gone?

579
00:47:52,504 --> 00:47:53,536
Did he really?

580
00:47:53,572 --> 00:47:55,438
He had a serious face on.

581
00:47:55,474 --> 00:47:57,841
He said, "Mom, I know that
daddy always mows the lawn."

582
00:47:57,876 --> 00:48:01,344
When he's in Iraq, I can do it."

583
00:48:01,880 --> 00:48:04,748
- He's a good kid.
- You're his hero.

584
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:12,389
You know who's
my hero, my heroine?

585
00:48:14,760 --> 00:48:18,495
It's you, I mean it.

586
00:48:20,799 --> 00:48:24,734
With you here, I know I don't have
to worry about anything or anyone.

587
00:48:44,690 --> 00:48:46,856
Sir, ma'am, I'd like
to introduce my mother.

588
00:48:48,794 --> 00:48:50,872
Mom, this is Lieutenant Colonel
Volesky, our Battalion Commander.

589
00:48:50,896 --> 00:48:52,595
It's a pleasure, ma'am.

590
00:48:52,631 --> 00:48:54,676
Maybe you can explain to me
why my son is going to Iraq,

591
00:48:54,700 --> 00:48:57,367
when the terrorists who
attacked us are in Afghanistan.

592
00:48:57,402 --> 00:48:58,768
- Mom, I'm sorry, sir.
- It's okay.

593
00:48:58,804 --> 00:49:01,371
You let your mother speak.

594
00:49:01,406 --> 00:49:04,474
We've found Saddam Hussein, but no
sign of those WMD's we were promised.

595
00:49:04,810 --> 00:49:06,609
That was all lies.

596
00:49:06,645 --> 00:49:08,745
I don't mind your candor.

597
00:49:08,780 --> 00:49:11,659
And to answer your question, as a soldier,
your son goes where the United States.

598
00:49:11,683 --> 00:49:13,450
Government sends him.

599
00:49:13,485 --> 00:49:15,385
And right now, our
orders are to go to Iraq.

600
00:49:15,420 --> 00:49:18,455
Why, so we can have cheaper gas?

601
00:49:18,490 --> 00:49:21,658
Where we're going, Sadr City,
over two million people lived

602
00:49:21,693 --> 00:49:24,728
under a dictator's
boot for 24 years.

603
00:49:24,763 --> 00:49:28,398
And we can build a better future
for them, for the whole country.

604
00:49:28,433 --> 00:49:30,400
That's why we're going.

605
00:49:30,435 --> 00:49:32,669
That's why your son is going.

606
00:49:32,704 --> 00:49:34,471
You believe that?

607
00:49:34,506 --> 00:49:37,373
That's why I do what I do.

608
00:49:37,676 --> 00:49:40,677
Please, bring my baby home.

609
00:49:45,550 --> 00:49:46,816
I promise you.

610
00:49:46,852 --> 00:49:49,419
Every man is coming back safely.

611
00:49:49,454 --> 00:49:51,554
How can you promise that?

612
00:49:51,590 --> 00:49:53,790
Because I believe that too.

613
00:49:53,825 --> 00:49:57,427
And because it's
my responsibility.

614
00:49:59,731 --> 00:50:01,765
Come here.

615
00:50:05,537 --> 00:50:06,636
Staircase, left.

616
00:50:12,644 --> 00:50:14,511
Hey, hey, hey, hey,
hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

617
00:50:15,480 --> 00:50:17,680
- Hey, freeze, freeze.
- Come down slowly, slowly.

618
00:50:17,716 --> 00:50:18,893
Come slowly, come really slow.

619
00:50:18,917 --> 00:50:21,584
Wild, secure him.

620
00:50:32,631 --> 00:50:33,674
What the hell is she saying?

621
00:50:33,698 --> 00:50:34,864
Please.

622
00:50:34,900 --> 00:50:38,468
Come to me, slow, slowly.

623
00:50:38,870 --> 00:50:40,670
Shit, Wild, on me.

624
00:50:40,705 --> 00:50:41,738
Stop, stop.

625
00:50:41,773 --> 00:50:42,872
Perry, watch her.

626
00:50:42,908 --> 00:50:43,873
Jackson, you're with me.

627
00:50:43,909 --> 00:50:45,508
Haubert, Bellamy,
search the kitchen.

628
00:50:45,544 --> 00:50:46,743
Stay frosty.

629
00:50:46,778 --> 00:50:48,556
Every household's permitted
an AK here, let's go.

630
00:50:48,580 --> 00:50:50,647
Stop, on the ground.

631
00:50:54,653 --> 00:50:55,819
How is he?

632
00:50:55,854 --> 00:50:56,854
I don't know.

633
00:50:58,523 --> 00:50:59,789
<i>Red One, this is Lancer Six.</i>

634
00:51:00,559 --> 00:51:01,858
- You got him?
- Yeah, go.

635
00:51:01,893 --> 00:51:03,793
Over here in the shade, come on.

636
00:51:09,601 --> 00:51:11,401
Come on, help
me get this Kevlar off.

637
00:51:11,603 --> 00:51:13,503
Everything off now.

638
00:51:55,814 --> 00:51:57,780
Jackson, give me one.

639
00:52:26,678 --> 00:52:28,511
Please, no hurt.

640
00:52:29,881 --> 00:52:32,815
Slowly.

641
00:52:34,686 --> 00:52:37,687
Jackson, secure her.

642
00:52:40,825 --> 00:52:43,626
Jackson, take her downstairs.

643
00:52:53,738 --> 00:52:56,639
Wild, Rob?

644
00:52:56,675 --> 00:52:59,876
Up here, Sergeant B.

645
00:52:59,911 --> 00:53:02,779
Sergeant Rob got us roof access.

646
00:53:03,815 --> 00:53:05,515
Well, scope it out.

647
00:53:05,550 --> 00:53:07,784
I gotta go check on Chen.

648
00:53:11,790 --> 00:53:14,457
Chen.

649
00:53:15,527 --> 00:53:17,560
What do you got, doc?

650
00:53:47,726 --> 00:53:48,891
Put her down.

651
00:53:58,903 --> 00:54:00,737
Sir, we got roof access.

652
00:54:00,772 --> 00:54:01,882
It's good, high
ground advantage.

653
00:54:01,906 --> 00:54:03,573
Sergeant Rob's up there now.

654
00:54:03,608 --> 00:54:06,609
- All right, Perry.
- Yes, sir. -You stay with the family.

655
00:54:06,644 --> 00:54:09,412
Jackson, everyone else, to
the roof, set a perimeter.

656
00:54:09,447 --> 00:54:12,582
Come on, let's go.

657
00:54:18,556 --> 00:54:19,589
How is he doing?

658
00:54:19,624 --> 00:54:21,591
He's not breathing.

659
00:54:21,626 --> 00:54:23,526
Sir, I have Colonel Volesky.

660
00:54:23,561 --> 00:54:24,660
What do we do, doc?

661
00:54:24,696 --> 00:54:25,906
I got to take care of his wound.

662
00:54:25,930 --> 00:54:28,631
Hey, we're fixing
you up, all right?

663
00:54:31,770 --> 00:54:33,903
Lancer Six, Comanche
Red One, over.

664
00:54:33,938 --> 00:54:35,772
Quiet at the TOC!

665
00:54:39,611 --> 00:54:42,512
Comanche Red One, we
need your coordinates.

666
00:54:42,814 --> 00:54:46,516
The GPS trackers in your
vehicles are not active, over.

667
00:54:46,551 --> 00:54:49,585
Contact began north of the
Mosque near the Sadr Bureau,

668
00:54:49,621 --> 00:54:50,787
continued for some time.

669
00:54:50,822 --> 00:54:52,522
The Mosque is right here.

670
00:54:52,557 --> 00:54:53,667
I'm not really sure of
our current position.

671
00:54:53,691 --> 00:54:55,558
We turned right down
an alleyway, break.

672
00:54:57,829 --> 00:55:02,465
Lancer Six, I have a litterurgent
soldier in need of evac.

673
00:55:02,500 --> 00:55:03,800
It's Sergeant Chen, sir, over.

674
00:55:08,673 --> 00:55:09,839
Copy that, Red One.

675
00:55:09,874 --> 00:55:11,474
You stay vigilant.

676
00:55:11,509 --> 00:55:12,509
Help is on the way.

677
00:55:12,544 --> 00:55:14,577
Lancer Six out.

678
00:55:15,814 --> 00:55:19,615
Stay here, keep them informed.

679
00:55:19,651 --> 00:55:22,418
Squad leaders cover their
own guys, understood?

680
00:55:22,454 --> 00:55:23,853
Copy that.

681
00:55:33,498 --> 00:55:36,532
Relay a basewide alert for all
men to get into combat gear.

682
00:55:36,568 --> 00:55:38,734
Yes, sir.

683
00:55:40,004 --> 00:55:41,549
All right, he's been hit between
his fourth and fifth rib.

684
00:55:41,573 --> 00:55:42,672
Yeah.

685
00:55:42,707 --> 00:55:44,452
I need a JTube,
I got to open up his airway.

686
00:55:44,476 --> 00:55:45,586
All right, what's his status?

687
00:55:45,610 --> 00:55:46,854
At least one lung is punctured.

688
00:55:46,878 --> 00:55:48,578
All right, you hold this one.

689
00:55:48,613 --> 00:55:49,723
Put pressure on that right
there, put pressure on it.

690
00:55:49,747 --> 00:55:50,913
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

691
00:55:50,949 --> 00:55:52,715
- What can I do to help?
- Sergeant B. -Yeah?

692
00:55:52,750 --> 00:55:55,718
Give me short breaths in
cycles of two when I tell you.

693
00:55:55,753 --> 00:55:57,865
I need you to alternate with
compressions when I tell you, all right.

694
00:55:57,889 --> 00:56:01,424
Here we go, one, two,
three, four, five.

695
00:56:01,793 --> 00:56:03,726
Go ahead and
breathe for us, bud.

696
00:56:15,740 --> 00:56:18,674
Come on Chen,
breathe that out for me.

697
00:56:21,546 --> 00:56:23,546
I sent them to the Sadr Bureau.

698
00:56:23,581 --> 00:56:25,548
You let that go, brother.

699
00:56:25,583 --> 00:56:28,263
They timed this attack to the change
in authority for maximum chaos.

700
00:56:28,753 --> 00:56:31,621
It could've been
anyone's platoon.

701
00:56:31,656 --> 00:56:33,556
All right, now,
let's work this out.

702
00:56:33,591 --> 00:56:36,637
We've got the men and the vehicles to
extract, but we don't have the heavy weapons

703
00:56:36,661 --> 00:56:38,494
or the armor to penetrate.

704
00:56:38,530 --> 00:56:40,630
We have what, a handful
of Bradleys at the most?

705
00:56:40,665 --> 00:56:42,598
What about the
outgoing unit's QRF?

706
00:56:42,634 --> 00:56:44,767
The Crusaders, 237
Armor Battalion.

707
00:56:44,802 --> 00:56:45,835
They've stood down.

708
00:56:45,870 --> 00:56:47,603
Their deployment's over.

709
00:56:47,639 --> 00:56:49,438
They're leaving for Kuwait now.

710
00:56:49,474 --> 00:56:50,773
You get me their commander.

711
00:56:50,808 --> 00:56:54,443
With their tanks leading,
we take two convoys in.

712
00:56:54,779 --> 00:56:57,413
Rescue 1 will link up with
those Crusaders, God willing,

713
00:56:57,448 --> 00:56:59,615
make contact with
the Platoon and extract.

714
00:56:59,651 --> 00:57:01,517
Let me lead Rescue 1,
they're my guys.

715
00:57:01,553 --> 00:57:02,818
Very good.

716
00:57:02,854 --> 00:57:05,588
I'll take Rescue 2,
I'll be 15 minutes behind you.

717
00:57:05,623 --> 00:57:07,623
Secure a wide corridor
around the target.

718
00:57:07,659 --> 00:57:09,759
And we're gonna take
the same corridor in.

719
00:57:09,794 --> 00:57:13,563
We'll go Route Aeros
to Copper to Delta.

720
00:57:14,632 --> 00:57:16,799
We'll link up here.

721
00:57:16,834 --> 00:57:19,813
Before we launch, we wait for the Crusader
tanks to penetrate the enemy defenses.

722
00:57:19,837 --> 00:57:20,870
Roger that.

723
00:57:20,905 --> 00:57:22,705
All right, let's brief the men.

724
00:57:22,740 --> 00:57:23,839
Get the convoys assembling.

725
00:57:23,875 --> 00:57:25,841
Yes, sir.

726
00:57:27,612 --> 00:57:30,780
Hey, we'll get
them home, brother.

727
00:57:32,684 --> 00:57:34,617
We'll get them home.

728
00:57:36,788 --> 00:57:39,522
<i>Crusader XRay, this is
Lancer Six.</i>

729
00:57:41,693 --> 00:57:43,726
Lancer Six, this is Duke Six.

730
00:57:43,761 --> 00:57:46,674
Duke Six, I understand that you've stood
down, but I have troops in contact

731
00:57:46,698 --> 00:57:49,432
north of the
Sadr Bureau on Route Delta.

732
00:57:49,467 --> 00:57:52,627
I need immediate deployment of your QRF
to help extract, is this possible, over?

733
00:57:52,904 --> 00:57:55,549
Lancer Six, we've turned in all our
main gun ammo but we'll fight out

734
00:57:55,573 --> 00:57:57,406
of the hatches if we have to.

735
00:57:57,442 --> 00:57:58,574
The QRF will deploy.

736
00:57:58,610 --> 00:58:00,409
Will advise once en route, over.

737
00:58:00,612 --> 00:58:01,577
Thank you, Duke Six.

738
00:58:01,613 --> 00:58:03,446
Lancer Six out.

739
00:58:03,715 --> 00:58:07,483
Order Lieutenant Dean to
set the QRF to Redcon One.

740
00:58:19,831 --> 00:58:22,765
No weapons inside.

741
00:58:22,800 --> 00:58:24,800
We found access to
the adjacent rooftop.

742
00:58:24,836 --> 00:58:29,472
Haubert and Davis have the perimeters
set with Rogers, Denney, and Taylor.

743
00:58:29,507 --> 00:58:31,574
I don't see any hostiles.

744
00:58:31,609 --> 00:58:32,742
Maybe it's over?

745
00:58:32,777 --> 00:58:35,378
No, no, they're just regrouping.

746
00:58:36,514 --> 00:58:39,415
Wild, with me, we got to
bring up more ammo, let's go.

747
00:58:54,399 --> 00:58:55,576
All right, we're gonna swap out.

748
00:58:55,600 --> 00:58:58,567
- Roger that.
- Okay, go.

749
00:59:14,552 --> 00:59:17,353
Go ahead and
breathe it out, bud.

750
00:59:29,767 --> 00:59:31,867
Hey, what are you doing?

751
00:59:31,903 --> 00:59:33,602
His lungs are filled with blood.

752
00:59:33,638 --> 00:59:39,675
- You're not giving up.
- Chen, Chen. -Come on, Chen.

753
00:59:41,813 --> 00:59:44,580
Wake up for me, come on.

754
00:59:44,615 --> 00:59:46,415
Come on Chen., come on.

755
00:59:46,451 --> 00:59:47,750
Breathe for me, Chen.

756
00:59:47,785 --> 00:59:50,453
Come on, come on, brother.

757
00:59:50,488 --> 00:59:52,788
Wake the hell up.

758
00:59:54,859 --> 00:59:57,393
Come on, Chen.

759
00:59:57,595 --> 00:59:58,728
No!

760
01:00:20,718 --> 01:00:25,654
You, what did you do?

761
01:00:27,959 --> 01:00:30,493
What, I didn't do anything.

762
01:00:30,528 --> 01:00:31,727
I tried to help.

763
01:00:31,763 --> 01:00:33,696
He did the best he could,
Sergeant, stand down.

764
01:00:33,731 --> 01:00:36,866
Sir, this was a wide
wellplanned ambush.

765
01:00:39,504 --> 01:00:42,538
People knew.

766
01:00:46,711 --> 01:00:49,745
Those men at the mosque knew.

767
01:00:58,523 --> 01:01:01,791
Somebody tipped the enemy
off to our movements.

768
01:01:02,760 --> 01:01:06,595
And it's usually
the interpreters.

769
01:01:07,899 --> 01:01:13,502
- Are you an informant, Jassim?
- No, absolutely not, sir.

770
01:01:20,745 --> 01:01:24,880
- Jassim, look at me right now.
- Yeah. -Look at me.

771
01:01:29,587 --> 01:01:31,854
Did you do this?

772
01:01:33,825 --> 01:01:35,891
I was helping him.

773
01:01:35,927 --> 01:01:39,628
I did everything I could.

774
01:01:51,742 --> 01:01:55,544
Guys, listen up.

775
01:01:58,449 --> 01:02:01,450
This man was in my Humvee.

776
01:02:01,853 --> 01:02:05,554
He got shot at just
like the rest of us.

777
01:02:08,526 --> 01:02:10,793
And he tried to save
Chen, you understand?

778
01:02:12,897 --> 01:02:15,664
There's nothing Jassim or anybody
could have done to save Chen.

779
01:02:15,700 --> 01:02:18,634
- You don't know that.
- Yeah, I'm a damn medic. -Enough already.

780
01:02:18,669 --> 01:02:22,505
Enough, both of you.

781
01:02:22,540 --> 01:02:25,060
You guys wanna make it back to
base without any more casualties?

782
01:02:28,479 --> 01:02:31,480
Now, we have to work
together, is that clear?

783
01:02:31,516 --> 01:02:37,786
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir. -Is that clear?

784
01:02:37,822 --> 01:02:40,890
- Yes, sir.
- Then move.

785
01:02:40,925 --> 01:02:45,528
Grab the dismount and get the
rest of the ammo up to the roof.

786
01:02:55,740 --> 01:02:59,542
Sergeant Bourquin, that
was a direct order.

787
01:03:05,516 --> 01:03:07,750
Sergeant.

788
01:03:23,834 --> 01:03:26,702
You okay, Jassim?

789
01:03:28,739 --> 01:03:31,807
I wanna apologize.

790
01:03:32,910 --> 01:03:34,877
We're all just
emotional right now.

791
01:03:34,912 --> 01:03:37,713
I understand.

792
01:03:37,949 --> 01:03:41,450
Go inside.

793
01:03:41,485 --> 01:03:43,485
Find Perry, he could
use an interpreter.

794
01:04:37,717 --> 01:04:39,584
Alk to.

795
01:04:39,619 --> 01:04:40,763
There they are, just a moment.

796
01:04:40,787 --> 01:04:41,919
Go, go.

797
01:04:41,955 --> 01:04:45,523
Mrs. Volesky, Mrs. Donemy,
I'm Lupita Garza.

798
01:04:46,526 --> 01:04:48,526
Israel is a Specialist
with the 25.

799
01:04:48,561 --> 01:04:50,628
So is Angel's brother,
Robert Arsiaga.

800
01:04:50,663 --> 01:04:51,496
The twins?

801
01:04:51,531 --> 01:04:52,830
Yeah.

802
01:04:52,866 --> 01:04:55,600
We just heard something
happened in Sadr City.

803
01:04:55,635 --> 01:04:57,502
I don't understand, I
just spoke to Israel.

804
01:04:57,537 --> 01:04:59,804
My friend's husband is
stationed in Baghdad.

805
01:04:59,839 --> 01:05:02,673
He told her there was radio
chatter, something about an ambush.

806
01:05:02,709 --> 01:05:03,808
My God.

807
01:05:03,843 --> 01:05:06,744
Okay, let's not
jump to conclusions.

808
01:05:06,780 --> 01:05:09,847
There are always rumors during deployment,
and, and they're rarely true.

809
01:05:09,883 --> 01:05:11,649
I know.

810
01:05:11,684 --> 01:05:12,862
That's why I wanted to see you.

811
01:05:12,886 --> 01:05:14,919
I mean, they would notify
Family Readiness, right?

812
01:05:14,954 --> 01:05:17,455
We would be among the
first that they would call.

813
01:05:17,490 --> 01:05:19,924
Look, I'm sure that
everything's fine.

814
01:05:19,959 --> 01:05:23,494
LeAnn, what if
something did happen?

815
01:05:23,530 --> 01:05:25,530
Let me call Dexter Jordan.

816
01:05:25,565 --> 01:05:26,809
He's the Rear
Detachment Commander.

817
01:05:26,833 --> 01:05:28,666
He would be the first
person they'd call.

818
01:05:28,701 --> 01:05:30,701
Thank you so much.

819
01:05:37,644 --> 01:05:39,544
Hi, Dexter, it's LeAnn Volesky.

820
01:05:39,579 --> 01:05:41,546
Good.

821
01:05:41,581 --> 01:05:44,527
Listen, apparently, there's some chatter
about an attack going on in Sadr City.

822
01:05:44,551 --> 01:05:47,518
Have you heard anything?

823
01:05:49,689 --> 01:05:51,589
Great, okay.

824
01:05:51,624 --> 01:05:53,458
Thank you, no, I'll
talk to you soon.

825
01:05:53,493 --> 01:05:54,670
There's no word of any trouble.

826
01:05:54,694 --> 01:05:56,661
- Thank God.
- I'm so sorry.

827
01:05:56,696 --> 01:05:58,629
I didn't mean to scare everyone.

828
01:05:58,665 --> 01:06:00,876
Just this deployment's driving me
crazy and they've only just left.

829
01:06:00,900 --> 01:06:03,768
- I know the feeling.
- We all do.

830
01:06:09,876 --> 01:06:13,611
Israel's never even
been overseas, not once.

831
01:06:13,646 --> 01:06:15,780
It is just a
peacekeeping mission.

832
01:06:15,815 --> 01:06:16,914
He'll be fine.

833
01:06:16,950 --> 01:06:19,851
They will all be fine.

834
01:06:19,886 --> 01:06:22,620
How can you know?

835
01:06:22,655 --> 01:06:25,735
Because in his 20 years in the Army, my
husband's never lost a man in combat.

836
01:07:00,860 --> 01:07:04,395
Hey, bud, I,

837
01:07:06,866 --> 01:07:13,471
I don't know if, I don't know
if you were a religious man,

838
01:07:14,774 --> 01:07:18,776
but, I guess we never really
talked about that stuff?

839
01:07:18,811 --> 01:07:25,483
Um, like, I don't really know when the
last time I went to mass was, but, um,

840
01:07:29,923 --> 01:07:33,858
I guess if it's okay with you I'd
like to say a little prayer.

841
01:07:48,708 --> 01:07:52,843
Dear Lord, I humbly entrust to
you my brother, Eddie Chen.

842
01:07:54,480 --> 01:07:59,483
I pray that you may take him
into your arms, dear Lord.

843
01:08:00,920 --> 01:08:05,523
Allow him entry into your paradise
that his soul may rest in peace.

844
01:08:06,559 --> 01:08:08,826
In Your name, I pray.

845
01:08:47,767 --> 01:08:51,769
I'm so sorry.

846
01:08:53,773 --> 01:08:57,508
I'm so sorry.

847
01:10:57,530 --> 01:11:00,598
What's he going on about?

848
01:11:02,802 --> 01:11:05,770
Um, he's just complaining
about being tied up.

849
01:11:35,668 --> 01:11:38,736
Sergeant, 11:00.

850
01:11:40,673 --> 01:11:41,972
The Humvees.

851
01:11:42,008 --> 01:11:43,707
We got all the equipment.

852
01:11:43,743 --> 01:11:45,587
Z'd out the radios, theres
nothing left for the enemy.

853
01:11:45,611 --> 01:11:46,877
No, not that.

854
01:11:46,913 --> 01:11:48,846
We can use them as
markers for the rescuers.

855
01:11:48,881 --> 01:11:52,450
The minaret they can see from miles away,
but those can help pinpoint our position.

856
01:11:54,587 --> 01:11:56,520
That's good.

857
01:11:57,657 --> 01:12:02,693
Okay look, I get it, okay?

858
01:12:06,666 --> 01:12:09,834
You're upset about
Chen, so am I.

859
01:12:10,837 --> 01:12:14,505
Not everyone here is the enemy.

860
01:12:14,540 --> 01:12:19,910
- Yeah, I know that.
- These men look up to you.

861
01:12:22,849 --> 01:12:24,882
They follow your lead.

862
01:12:24,917 --> 01:12:28,686
I need to know that you can still
work with Jassim, understand?

863
01:12:30,690 --> 01:12:33,924
Roger that, sir.

864
01:12:38,764 --> 01:12:43,701
Yeah, all right, yeah.

865
01:13:08,594 --> 01:13:09,594
Sarge?

866
01:13:09,629 --> 01:13:13,664
Yeah, I see her.

867
01:13:33,920 --> 01:13:36,787
Hey Riddell, are you okay?

868
01:13:36,822 --> 01:13:38,489
Yeah!

869
01:13:38,524 --> 01:13:39,590
Sir, we got a peeker!

870
01:13:39,625 --> 01:13:40,891
West wall, hundred meters out!

871
01:13:40,927 --> 01:13:43,594
Take him out!

872
01:14:22,501 --> 01:14:23,901
Holy sh...

873
01:14:25,571 --> 01:14:28,539
Hey guys, Riddell just
got himself a head shot!

874
01:14:29,775 --> 01:14:32,476
- Hell, yeah.
- All right.

875
01:14:32,511 --> 01:14:35,913
- Yeah.
- Whoa. -Good job there, Riddell.

876
01:15:02,458 --> 01:15:04,492
<i>Crusader XRay, this
is Crusader Blue One,</i>

877
01:15:04,527 --> 01:15:06,427
<i>approaching the
perimeter of Sadr City.</i>

878
01:15:06,462 --> 01:15:08,529
<i>No sign of hostile activity.</i>

879
01:15:26,649 --> 01:15:30,518
Can you believe
it's only our day four here?

880
01:15:30,553 --> 01:15:32,831
Home feels about a million miles
away right now, doesn't it?

881
01:15:32,855 --> 01:15:35,656
Yeah.

882
01:15:37,160 --> 01:15:41,662
I've been meaning to ask you,
someone said you're a teacher for a

883
01:15:41,698 --> 01:15:43,664
atrisk youth or something?

884
01:15:44,867 --> 01:15:46,734
Back in Arkansas, yeah.

885
01:15:46,769 --> 01:15:51,639
Why?

886
01:15:51,674 --> 01:15:55,609
Back home, I was atrisk youth.

887
01:15:56,546 --> 01:16:00,414
Yet here we both are.

888
01:16:00,450 --> 01:16:02,650
Here we both are.

889
01:16:33,950 --> 01:16:35,583
The Crusaders are en route.

890
01:16:35,618 --> 01:16:36,829
We'll launch soon,
what's our status?

891
01:16:36,853 --> 01:16:38,452
Almost ready, sir.

892
01:16:38,488 --> 01:16:40,688
Armor's a concern.

893
01:16:40,723 --> 01:16:43,535
Some of the vehicles we can reinforce, but
the LMTVs have no protection in the back.

894
01:16:43,559 --> 01:16:46,727
Plus we only have four
Bradleys, two for each convoy.

895
01:16:47,563 --> 01:16:48,874
Yeah, with the Crusaders,
that should be sufficient.

896
01:16:48,898 --> 01:16:50,676
I'll take the LMTV's in
the rear of my convoy.

897
01:16:50,700 --> 01:16:51,732
Roger.

898
01:16:51,768 --> 01:16:53,734
Also we're short on radios.

899
01:16:53,770 --> 01:16:55,748
All right, let's get an order
out to all team leaders.

900
01:16:55,772 --> 01:16:58,773
You maintain visual contact with
your convoy at all times, got it?

901
01:16:58,808 --> 01:17:00,541
Yes, sir.

902
01:17:13,589 --> 01:17:15,456
This is crazy.

903
01:17:15,491 --> 01:17:16,757
We'll be sitting ducks.

904
01:17:16,793 --> 01:17:18,692
And we'd be able to aim out.

905
01:17:18,728 --> 01:17:21,595
We're just gonna be
guarding the cordon.

906
01:17:23,666 --> 01:17:26,567
Guess you ain't nervous
if you're bringing a book.

907
01:17:26,602 --> 01:17:28,736
I just don't wanna lose it.

908
01:17:28,771 --> 01:17:30,471
What is it, anyway?

909
01:17:30,506 --> 01:17:32,540
It's just war poetry.

910
01:17:32,575 --> 01:17:37,444
What's this,
it's book club meeting?

911
01:17:42,585 --> 01:17:45,886
And when we're out there, and this, this
goes for all of you, hey, listen up.

912
01:17:48,724 --> 01:17:51,725
Remember that simple rule, the
only thing you'll be focused on,

913
01:17:51,761 --> 01:17:56,764
the only thing that can keep you and your
fellow soldier safe is that you cover your

914
01:17:56,799 --> 01:18:01,836
sector, and trust the man next to
you is doing the same, that's it.

915
01:18:06,843 --> 01:18:09,443
You, you lose focus,

916
01:18:10,713 --> 01:18:16,417
you try to be a hero, you
end up dead, that clear?

917
01:18:17,787 --> 01:18:19,787
- Yes, sergeant.
- Yes, sergeant.

918
01:18:20,523 --> 01:18:22,656
- Yes, sergeant.
- Okay, sergeant.

919
01:18:31,667 --> 01:18:35,569
Is, that it Staff Sergeant?

920
01:18:38,641 --> 01:18:42,476
Staff Sergeant, aren't we
heading out a few minutes?

921
01:18:45,882 --> 01:18:48,883
What is his deal?

922
01:18:48,918 --> 01:18:51,552
Don't worry about it, man.

923
01:18:51,587 --> 01:18:54,622
Dude's a crank, but he's been doing
this a hell of a lot longer than us.

924
01:18:56,492 --> 01:18:57,691
He's a solid soldier.

925
01:18:57,727 --> 01:18:59,660
Is he?

926
01:18:59,695 --> 01:19:02,496
What else would they've stoplossed
him and made him come here?

927
01:19:02,531 --> 01:19:05,699
That's what I'm worried about
is to follow that guy's lead.

928
01:19:06,936 --> 01:19:10,471
Hey, do you think I got time
to call Tracie before we go?

929
01:19:10,506 --> 01:19:13,540
Yeah, I think we
have a few minutes.

930
01:19:14,777 --> 01:19:17,611
- Tracie's gonna be pissed.
- She's gonna be proud.

931
01:19:17,647 --> 01:19:19,680
Lupe's gonna be pissed.

932
01:19:30,860 --> 01:19:33,494
May I help you, Staff Sergeant?

933
01:19:33,763 --> 01:19:36,764
You want something for the road?

934
01:19:39,702 --> 01:19:45,673
I think I'd like
to sit down for a meal

935
01:19:47,543 --> 01:19:50,778
actually if you
have something left.

936
01:19:50,813 --> 01:19:56,450
- Sure, do you have time?
- Yeah, yeah, I have time.

937
01:20:13,970 --> 01:20:17,638
Time for just one last meal.

938
01:20:26,983 --> 01:20:29,817
Red One, Lancer Six, over.

939
01:20:29,852 --> 01:20:32,586
<i>Lancer Six, we've spotted our two
immobilized Victors on Delta.</i>

940
01:20:32,621 --> 01:20:35,823
<i>Our position is approximately 250
meters northwest down an alley, over.</i>

941
01:20:36,659 --> 01:20:37,825
Solid copy, Red One.

942
01:20:37,860 --> 01:20:39,660
QRF is on its way.

943
01:20:39,695 --> 01:20:42,496
Prepare your men for exfil and
evac of the wounded, over.

944
01:20:45,634 --> 01:20:49,837
Lancer Six, Sergeant
Chen is dead, sir, over.

945
01:21:02,618 --> 01:21:05,586
Copy that, Red One.

946
01:21:05,621 --> 01:21:06,754
I'm sorry.

947
01:21:06,789 --> 01:21:07,888
Continue your prep.

948
01:21:07,923 --> 01:21:09,890
Six out.

949
01:21:15,965 --> 01:21:19,833
I promised Chen's parents
I'd get him home safe.

950
01:21:23,739 --> 01:21:26,940
I promised to all of them.

951
01:21:26,976 --> 01:21:29,510
Sir, you're needed at the TOC.

952
01:21:29,545 --> 01:21:31,845
Something has
happened to the QRF.

953
01:21:42,825 --> 01:21:44,758
Sir, the Crusaders
have been ambushed.

954
01:21:44,794 --> 01:21:46,493
What?

955
01:21:46,529 --> 01:21:47,694
<i>Mitchell is dead, sir.</i>

956
01:21:47,730 --> 01:21:49,408
<i>I repeat, Sergeant
Mitchell has been killed.</i>

957
01:21:49,432 --> 01:21:51,843
<i>First Lieutenant Dean and Specialist
Sanders have both been hit.</i>

958
01:21:51,867 --> 01:21:55,469
<i>Blue Two is black on coax.</i>

959
01:21:55,504 --> 01:21:58,739
<i>All Crusader Blues, Blue One, abort
and pull back for casualty evac.</i>

960
01:21:59,708 --> 01:22:02,643
<i>We cannot continue, over.</i>

961
01:22:03,779 --> 01:22:07,581
How is Alex handling everything?

962
01:22:07,616 --> 01:22:10,056
Well, he knows his Daddy is helping
people in foreign country.

963
01:22:11,487 --> 01:22:12,886
But...

964
01:22:12,922 --> 01:22:15,589
He just doesn't understand he
can't come home more often.

965
01:22:15,624 --> 01:22:16,802
He's a very brave little boy.

966
01:22:16,826 --> 01:22:18,926
Yes, he is.

967
01:22:18,961 --> 01:22:21,628
You know, we almost lost
him when he was first born.

968
01:22:21,664 --> 01:22:25,566
- Really?
- He was born at 25 weeks.-

969
01:22:25,601 --> 01:22:29,636
- So underweight and, and the doctor
thought that he might not live the night.

970
01:22:32,775 --> 01:22:34,775
But he was a fighter.

971
01:22:34,810 --> 01:22:37,845
Gary and I decided right then and
there we were just gonna love him,

972
01:22:37,880 --> 01:22:41,648
every day of his life, and then
that was two days or 200 years.

973
01:22:42,518 --> 01:22:45,786
Troy and I didn't even know if he'd
be here when Merrick was born.

974
01:22:46,655 --> 01:22:50,824
Now I guess the upside is he's too
young to really miss his dad.

975
01:22:51,660 --> 01:22:56,396
The thing I worry about is if he
comes back different, you know.

976
01:22:58,734 --> 01:23:02,836
We hear stories about guys
who come back changed and...

977
01:23:02,872 --> 01:23:06,507
He's in good hands with Gary.

978
01:23:06,542 --> 01:23:08,775
And the Lord never gives us
more than we can handle.

979
01:23:09,778 --> 01:23:11,912
I wish I had your faith.

980
01:23:11,947 --> 01:23:13,892
I just believe that what's
meant to happen will happen.

981
01:23:13,916 --> 01:23:17,818
And there's no point worrying
about it until it does.

982
01:23:27,830 --> 01:23:29,796
Just like Daddy's car?

983
01:23:29,832 --> 01:23:32,799
It's not a car, it's a Humvee.

984
01:23:40,943 --> 01:23:43,810
Sir, our police liaison reports
alSadr's militia has seized control

985
01:23:43,846 --> 01:23:46,747
of all police stations.

986
01:23:46,782 --> 01:23:48,827
Apparently, the men who attacked
the Crusaders ambushed them

987
01:23:48,851 --> 01:23:52,486
using police uniforms.

988
01:23:52,721 --> 01:23:54,688
This is citywide, sir.

989
01:23:54,723 --> 01:23:55,867
There's no one else right now.

990
01:23:55,891 --> 01:23:58,692
Just us.

991
01:23:59,795 --> 01:24:02,496
What are your orders, sir?

992
01:24:02,531 --> 01:24:04,665
We launch now.

993
01:24:05,501 --> 01:24:06,678
Sir, the Crusaders still
have to complete casevac...

994
01:24:06,702 --> 01:24:08,435
There's no time.

995
01:24:08,470 --> 01:24:09,903
It could take an hour.

996
01:24:09,939 --> 01:24:12,706
It could take several until they're
back in the fight and to target.

997
01:24:12,741 --> 01:24:14,741
Our guys don't have that long.

998
01:24:14,777 --> 01:24:16,810
We launch.

999
01:24:20,683 --> 01:24:26,420
Brother Randazzo, the Crusader
loader who was killed, Mitchell,

1000
01:24:27,489 --> 01:24:29,590
you find out his first name
and where he was from.

1001
01:24:29,625 --> 01:24:32,593
Yes, sir.

1002
01:24:40,803 --> 01:24:43,737
Sir, shouldn't the
QRF be here by now?

1003
01:24:44,974 --> 01:24:46,707
They'll be here.

1004
01:24:52,781 --> 01:24:55,849
Have no fear, Fisk,
it's not your time yet.

1005
01:24:57,720 --> 01:25:01,455
The big man upstairs knows you still
plan to whoop my ass in some D&D.

1006
01:25:01,490 --> 01:25:03,624
I will, too.

1007
01:25:08,864 --> 01:25:11,531
I'll be on the roof.

1008
01:25:11,567 --> 01:25:12,699
Get me if there's an update.

1009
01:25:12,735 --> 01:25:14,668
Yes, sir.

1010
01:25:34,590 --> 01:25:36,456
Put this on.

1011
01:25:36,492 --> 01:25:38,492
Sir.

1012
01:25:38,527 --> 01:25:40,794
Put it on.

1013
01:25:45,701 --> 01:25:48,802
Sergeant Chen doesn't
need his armor anymore.

1014
01:25:49,905 --> 01:25:54,508
Someone should use it.

1015
01:26:07,890 --> 01:26:09,990
Good.

1016
01:26:13,562 --> 01:26:15,862
I might need you
in the fight, too.

1017
01:26:43,616 --> 01:26:44,682
You want one?

1018
01:26:44,717 --> 01:26:47,385
Yeah, thanks.

1019
01:26:56,763 --> 01:26:59,363
Thanks.

1020
01:27:26,459 --> 01:27:29,527
I remember the first day we got
here, we drove by a car crash.

1021
01:27:31,664 --> 01:27:37,568
The driver was still inside, all bloodied
and shit, been dead for two days.

1022
01:27:40,506 --> 01:27:41,639
Yeah.

1023
01:27:41,674 --> 01:27:44,408
And I'm just making the point.

1024
01:27:44,444 --> 01:27:47,623
There's a dead guy laying in the middle of
the street with flies crawling out of his

1025
01:27:47,647 --> 01:27:52,750
eyeballs and nostrils, not one
person cared enough to even stop.

1026
01:27:58,725 --> 01:28:00,591
Maybe these
people are just numb.

1027
01:28:00,626 --> 01:28:02,593
I mean, look at this place.

1028
01:28:02,628 --> 01:28:04,395
People must drop
dead here every day.

1029
01:28:04,430 --> 01:28:06,464
Screw them.

1030
01:28:06,866 --> 01:28:09,500
We're here to clean up their shit
up and they're pissed at us?

1031
01:28:10,436 --> 01:28:12,470
We did invade and occupy
their country, Riddell.

1032
01:28:12,505 --> 01:28:15,439
To get rid of Saddam Hussein.

1033
01:28:15,475 --> 01:28:17,708
The asshole who abused them.

1034
01:28:18,745 --> 01:28:20,578
And we don't do this.

1035
01:28:20,613 --> 01:28:22,546
These people use their kids.

1036
01:28:22,582 --> 01:28:24,749
And who does that?

1037
01:28:25,885 --> 01:28:29,587
Look around you, what's
death to living in this shit?

1038
01:28:30,690 --> 01:28:32,523
Paradise.

1039
01:28:32,558 --> 01:28:34,492
That's great for them.

1040
01:28:34,527 --> 01:28:37,762
They've made me
into, into a killer.

1041
01:28:41,768 --> 01:28:43,667
I hope they're happy.

1042
01:28:47,740 --> 01:28:48,639
What the hell was that?

1043
01:28:48,674 --> 01:28:50,641
Sir.

1044
01:29:45,731 --> 01:29:47,498
Come in.

1045
01:29:48,901 --> 01:29:53,437
Sir, the Crusaders
loader you asked about,

1046
01:29:53,472 --> 01:29:54,672
Sergeant Michael W. Mitchell,

1047
01:29:54,707 --> 01:29:57,408
from Porterville, California.

1048
01:29:57,443 --> 01:29:59,610
He volunteered for
the mission, sir.

1049
01:29:59,912 --> 01:30:02,613
He was 25, about to be married.

1050
01:30:03,482 --> 01:30:05,616
Thank you, brother.

1051
01:30:23,703 --> 01:30:28,639
Lord, please care for Sergeant Chen and
Sergeant Mitchell and their families.

1052
01:30:30,276 --> 01:30:33,396
Bless them for their sacrifice and let
them be the last to fall in this battle.

1053
01:30:39,585 --> 01:30:42,519
Send me those
angels you promised.

1054
01:30:57,837 --> 01:31:00,471
<i>Red platoon reports two
Victors have been abandoned.</i>

1055
01:31:01,507 --> 01:31:03,607
The Crusaders got ambushed.

1056
01:31:03,643 --> 01:31:05,409
We got to go ahead alone.

1057
01:31:05,444 --> 01:31:08,445
- I'll give the order to roll.
- Godspeed, brother.

1058
01:31:08,781 --> 01:31:10,748
I'll be 15 minutes behind you.

1059
01:31:10,783 --> 01:31:12,683
Let's get the boys back.

1060
01:31:13,452 --> 01:31:15,686
All right, Comanche Whites,
mount up, we're rolling.

1061
01:31:29,769 --> 01:31:31,669
Everyone ready, Weibley?

1062
01:31:31,704 --> 01:31:34,405
- Ready, sir.
- Spicer? -Ready.

1063
01:31:40,680 --> 01:31:42,780
Chaplain, would you say
a blessing for a second?

1064
01:31:43,749 --> 01:31:45,482
Of course, sir.

1065
01:31:47,753 --> 01:31:50,793
Merciful God, we ask you to bring peace
to these men as they go out in faith.

1066
01:31:58,597 --> 01:32:01,365
Give them courage, Lord.

1067
01:32:02,702 --> 01:32:06,370
Courage to perform their
duties with honor and dignity.

1068
01:32:12,511 --> 01:32:16,447
May they be triumphant in victory
as they show mercy to our enemies.

1069
01:32:27,493 --> 01:32:30,461
Out of the depths, we
call to you, O Lord.

1070
01:32:31,530 --> 01:32:33,630
Protect these men.

1071
01:32:33,666 --> 01:32:37,568
Be their constant companion
and their strength in battle.

1072
01:32:40,573 --> 01:32:43,741
Though they may enter the unknown
let their fate be of comfort.

1073
01:32:49,782 --> 01:32:52,783
Bless these brothers and help them
remain steadfast in their mission.

1074
01:32:58,791 --> 01:33:01,692
Give each men renewed
strength and purpose.

1075
01:33:05,564 --> 01:33:11,368
Cast away any sense of fear they may
have, and give them solace in the

1076
01:33:11,771 --> 01:33:15,406
face of adversity.

1077
01:33:15,775 --> 01:33:19,710
Guide them, O Lord, that
they may return in safety.

1078
01:33:21,747 --> 01:33:25,482
Hear our voices,
O Lord, bring them home.

1079
01:33:27,720 --> 01:33:29,853
This we ask of you.

1080
01:33:29,889 --> 01:33:32,823
In the name of the Father,
the Son, and the Holy Spirit.

1081
01:33:34,627 --> 01:33:37,394
Amen.

1082
01:33:41,634 --> 01:33:42,833
They're all leaving.

1083
01:33:45,704 --> 01:33:49,640
Commanche 6, we have urgent surgical,
need an immediate evac, over.

1084
01:33:51,077 --> 01:33:53,877
Find a secure defensive position and
wait for extraction, we're coming.

1085
01:33:55,347 --> 01:33:58,627
This is a skilled and highly prepared enemy
who has coordinated a citywide attack.

1086
01:33:59,752 --> 01:34:01,618
- We can go that way.
- It's a trap.

1087
01:34:02,855 --> 01:34:04,621
The whole
platoon's been attacked.

1088
01:34:04,657 --> 01:34:07,658
- Who are the wounded?
- We don't have any information.

1089
01:34:16,836 --> 01:34:18,802
Come on baby, guide us home.
