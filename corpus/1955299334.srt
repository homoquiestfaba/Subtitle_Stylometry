536
00:50:41,160 --> 00:50:43,731
We did not come here to chase death.

537
00:50:48,560 --> 00:50:50,210
We came to deal it.

538
00:51:09,760 --> 00:51:11,728
(BOTH PANTING)

539
00:51:11,800 --> 00:51:13,370
Come on, we gotta keep moving.

540
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:15,169
I didn't want to kill him.

541
00:51:15,640 --> 00:51:17,483
WES: You didn't have a choice.

542
00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:21,481
No. We always have a choice.

543
00:51:23,680 --> 00:51:26,365
Look, you got two choices, all right?

544
00:51:27,680 --> 00:51:32,049
Either you fight,
or you stay here and you die.

545
00:51:33,720 --> 00:51:35,688
What's it gonna be?

546
00:51:42,760 --> 00:51:43,886
Good choice.

547
00:51:44,560 --> 00:51:45,561
(GRUNTS)

548
00:51:46,440 --> 00:51:47,851
You're hurt.

549
00:51:49,840 --> 00:51:52,286
- That needs to be treated.
- Yeah, with what?

550
00:51:52,360 --> 00:51:53,646
Let's go.

551
00:51:53,720 --> 00:51:55,245
I know a place.

552
00:51:57,760 --> 00:51:59,489
Ah, shit.

553
00:52:13,880 --> 00:52:15,644
Show me your wound.

554
00:52:29,880 --> 00:52:31,882
What are you going to do with your money?

555
00:52:35,160 --> 00:52:37,731
I'm gonna buy a big house by the sea.

556
00:52:39,200 --> 00:52:41,009
I'm trying to buy a whole village.

557
00:52:41,080 --> 00:52:42,081
Yeah?

558
00:52:45,200 --> 00:52:46,929
Did everybody leave?

559
00:52:47,800 --> 00:52:50,690
The soldiers told us they needed the land.

560
00:52:50,760 --> 00:52:53,969
But one of the soldiers
was from a nearby village.

561
00:52:54,040 --> 00:52:58,489
Told us that hunters had paid the General
to clear out this entire area.

562
00:53:00,160 --> 00:53:03,130
So, they moved us to a border town.
It's awful there.

563
00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:07,129
No way to make offerings
to the forest spirit.

564
00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:10,241
So, she's become very hungry.

565
00:53:10,920 --> 00:53:12,445
And very angry.

566
00:53:17,920 --> 00:53:21,288
Now that Y'wa is fed,
we will suffer no more.

567
00:53:22,120 --> 00:53:25,124
She'll return my brother
and village to me.

568
00:53:29,640 --> 00:53:30,641
Come.

569
00:53:31,800 --> 00:53:33,882
Show some respect.

571
00:54:26,960 --> 00:54:28,610

572
00:54:28,680 --> 00:54:30,250
Good. Get the kids.

00:54:46,200 --> 00:54:49,124
Okay, great.
So, what, we follow the road now?

576
00:54:49,200 --> 00:54:51,771
No, we go through this field. See?

577
00:54:51,880 --> 00:54:55,521
Down the river and further down
is the bridge to the border.

578
00:54:55,600 --> 00:54:57,250
Come on, let's go.

579
00:54:58,040 --> 00:54:59,485

581
00:55:00,720 --> 00:55:02,404

Get down.

They're here already?

590
00:55:25,240 --> 00:55:26,810
Get back there.

00:55:30,280 --> 00:55:31,520
Come on.

592
00:55:46,640 --> 00:55:48,130
That's right.

Stop! Everybody freeze!

00:56:16,160 --> 00:56:20,051
You've cornered your prey.
He's in the minefield, stuck, nowhere to go.

599
00:56:21,520 --> 00:56:22,646
Checkmate.

Why do you care so much about that watch?

Then what?

01:00:38,400 --> 01:00:40,243
Then I'll leave you.

(EXHALES)

658
01:01:18,520 --> 01:01:23,081
So, Aldrich, how'd you get into this
business, if you don't mind me asking?

659
01:01:24,280 --> 01:01:29,286
CIA didn't have much appreciation
for my talents.

660
01:01:29,360 --> 01:01:32,330
Said I was too theatrical.

661
01:01:32,760 --> 01:01:35,604
- Can you believe that?
- (CHUCKLES)

662
01:01:35,680 --> 01:01:38,251
So, I came up with my own business.

663
01:01:38,320 --> 01:01:39,890
Hunting with a twist.

664
01:01:41,840 --> 01:01:43,649
Turned into international success.

665
01:01:45,960 --> 01:01:49,601
The General was escorting rebels
in the Yangon prison.

666
01:01:51,440 --> 01:01:53,681
I suggest he help us hunt.

667
01:01:54,520 --> 01:01:55,806
He bites.

668
01:01:57,120 --> 01:02:01,205
I mean, prisoners
are gonna die anyway, right?

669
01:02:01,320 --> 01:02:03,561
So, why not have some fun?

670
01:02:03,640 --> 01:02:07,565
They let them loose in the jungle,
we acted as trackers,

671
01:02:07,640 --> 01:02:09,927
grew the business from there.

672
01:02:10,640 --> 01:02:12,449
So, the money's good?

673
01:02:12,800 --> 01:02:14,006
MADDEN: Yeah.

674
01:02:15,120 --> 01:02:16,724
Killing's better.

675
01:02:17,640 --> 01:02:20,291
Didn't get your fill in the military, huh?

676
01:02:20,880 --> 01:02:22,882
I was never in the service.

677
01:02:24,120 --> 01:02:26,487
Didn't make the psych evaluation.

678
01:02:30,680 --> 01:02:33,001
Pussies thought I was too crazy.

679
01:02:36,320 --> 01:02:38,322
Well, they weren't wrong.

680
01:02:43,160 --> 01:02:46,721
No. No, no. No.

Who's Jonny?

687
01:03:13,200 --> 01:03:15,043
Jonny was my best friend.

688
01:03:17,560 --> 01:03:20,484
We were both in line
for a shot at the title.

689
01:03:23,200 --> 01:03:25,726
They wanted us to fight each other.

690
01:03:26,120 --> 01:03:28,964
Offered us more money
than we'd ever known,

691
01:03:31,160 --> 01:03:32,525
so we did.

692
01:03:34,400 --> 01:03:35,561
I wanted to win.

693
01:03:35,640 --> 01:03:38,644
And I didn't want to leave it
in the hands of the judges,

694
01:03:39,960 --> 01:03:42,088
so I went for the knockout.

695
01:03:44,400 --> 01:03:46,880
I hit him so hard, he never woke up.

696
01:03:47,800 --> 01:03:49,450
It was an accident.

697
01:03:51,920 --> 01:03:54,366
You didn't mean for it to happen.

698
01:03:55,320 --> 01:03:56,321
(EXHALES)

699
01:03:57,640 --> 01:03:59,563
But it still happened.

01:04:40,880 --> 01:04:41,961
Oh, shit.

ALDRICH: Nice to see you again, Win.

704

How appropriate we caught you both
at this particular place.

705
01:04:57,280 --> 01:05:01,888
The Japanese killed nearly
100,000 workers building this railroad.

706
01:05:03,640 --> 01:05:05,130
Starvation,

707
01:05:06,040 --> 01:05:08,441
exhaustion, dysentery.

708
01:05:10,560 --> 01:05:13,245
Plenty of them got beaten to death.

709
01:05:14,080 --> 01:05:16,003
Where's Wes Baylor?

710
01:05:16,080 --> 01:05:17,491
I killed him.

711
01:05:17,600 --> 01:05:19,489
For the rubies.

712
01:05:20,720 --> 01:05:22,324

715
01:05:30,680 --> 01:05:32,284
I don't buy it.
