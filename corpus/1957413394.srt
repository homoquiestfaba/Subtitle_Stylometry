00:00:27,569 --> 00:00:29,571
[serene music playing]

2
00:00:38,288 --> 00:00:41,291
[woman speaking Cantonese]
<i>They were left in cardboard boxes,</i>

3
00:00:42,208 --> 00:00:46,629
<i>found near a bridge or on the sidewalk.</i>

4
00:00:50,216 --> 00:00:54,846
<i>There used to be so many of them.
More than 30 of them in a shift.</i>

5
00:00:57,223 --> 00:01:00,310
<i>We nannies had different tasks.</i>

6
00:01:01,853 --> 00:01:05,231
<i>Some fed the babies milk.
Some did the laundry.</i>

7
00:01:07,692 --> 00:01:09,235
<i>I looked after the babies.</i>

8
00:01:11,863 --> 00:01:13,782
<i>I remember many of them.</i>

9
00:01:17,202 --> 00:01:19,913
<i>These babies... I brought them up.</i>

10
00:01:21,831 --> 00:01:24,626
<i>I held them in my arms
and fed them slowly,</i>

11
00:01:24,709 --> 00:01:26,669
<i>as if they were my own children.</i>

12
00:01:31,341 --> 00:01:35,053
<i>My heart ached
whenever I sent a baby away.</i>

13
00:01:37,847 --> 00:01:40,058
<i>They'd be sent so far away.</i>

14
00:01:41,893 --> 00:01:43,520
<i>What was to become of them?</i>

15
00:01:48,775 --> 00:01:52,278
[girl 1 singing in Hebrew]

16
00:02:19,347 --> 00:02:21,987
[girl 2 in English] Hello,
welcome to Sonic. May I take your order?

17
00:02:22,976 --> 00:02:24,561
What sauce would you like?

18
00:02:25,061 --> 00:02:27,272
Your total is $8.75.
Have a nice day.

19
00:02:28,565 --> 00:02:31,025
We have $50 bills? What?

20
00:02:31,109 --> 00:02:32,109
[both laughing]

21
00:02:32,527 --> 00:02:35,321
No! Like, I've never
really seen one before.

22
00:02:35,405 --> 00:02:36,406
Yeah.

23
00:02:36,489 --> 00:02:38,908
- Hello, how are you?
- [customer] I'm good.

24
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:42,495
Here's your medium, unsweetened tea.
Have a wonderful day.

25
00:02:43,454 --> 00:02:44,454
Hello!

26
00:02:44,873 --> 00:02:47,125
- Hey, how was work?
- It was good.

27
00:02:47,208 --> 00:02:49,836
- Did you eat?
- Yeah, I ate mozzarella sticks.

28
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:51,546
- Is that all?
- Yeah.

29
00:02:56,551 --> 00:02:58,720
- [indistinct chatter]
- [girl chuckles]

30
00:02:58,803 --> 00:03:01,639
[girl 3] Oh, boy. Oh, boy, it's starting.
Here we go.

31
00:03:01,723 --> 00:03:03,683
[presenter] Danielle Bates.

32
00:03:04,851 --> 00:03:07,520
Lily Catherine Bolka.

33
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:13,067
Ladies and gentlemen,
I present to you the class of 2018.

34
00:03:13,151 --> 00:03:16,070
- Graduates, move your tassels!
- [all cheering]

35
00:03:16,154 --> 00:03:18,323
[man] One... two... You're good!

36
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:20,992
[graduates cheering]

37
00:03:22,076 --> 00:03:23,076
Hi.

38
00:03:24,245 --> 00:03:25,663
- Hi, Mom.
- Hello, honey.

39
00:03:26,289 --> 00:03:27,916
- Are you gonna cry?
- Yep.

40
00:03:27,999 --> 00:03:30,835
- Why are you crying?
- 'Cause I'm so proud of you.

41
00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:32,045
[kissing]

42
00:03:53,524 --> 00:03:56,027
So many have said to us, "Lucky girl."

43
00:03:56,694 --> 00:03:57,820
Maybe.

44
00:03:57,904 --> 00:03:58,947
Who am I to say?

45
00:03:59,656 --> 00:04:02,575
You came to us open and ready to be loved.

46
00:04:02,659 --> 00:04:03,534
We were lucky.

47
00:04:03,618 --> 00:04:05,912
You easily laughed and trusted.

48
00:04:05,995 --> 00:04:07,872
We are the lucky ones.

49
00:04:07,956 --> 00:04:11,751
No one really knows what goes on
in that matching room in China.

50
00:04:11,834 --> 00:04:13,962
But as your Hebrew middle name says,

51
00:04:14,045 --> 00:04:16,965
"My God has answered...
answered my prayers."

52
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:18,883
From the moment I held you,

53
00:04:18,967 --> 00:04:21,678
I've felt like
the luckiest woman in the world.

54
00:04:21,761 --> 00:04:23,763
[applause]

55
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:28,768
[girl 1] When she said that,
it made me think of, like, my other mom

56
00:04:28,851 --> 00:04:31,938
and like... if she was here, or...

57
00:04:32,021 --> 00:04:34,774
how life would be different
if I grew up with her.

58
00:04:34,857 --> 00:04:38,069
And what it would be
like to be in a different family.

59
00:04:38,152 --> 00:04:39,529
[man speaking Hebrew]

60
00:04:39,612 --> 00:04:42,907
I kind of want to get to know, like,
more of my Chinese side.

61
00:04:42,991 --> 00:04:44,534
I wanna learn, like, Mandarin,

62
00:04:44,617 --> 00:04:48,121
and I want to go to China
and see all the places and stuff.

63
00:04:50,456 --> 00:04:51,541
[Chloe]<i> It all started...</i>

64
00:04:51,624 --> 00:04:53,376
<i>I think I was in 7th grade,</i>

65
00:04:54,043 --> 00:04:58,339
<i>and, um, my dad was like,
"Oh, there's this website called 23andMe.</i>"

66
00:04:58,423 --> 00:05:00,300
<i>"And you, like, spit into a tube."</i>

67
00:05:00,883 --> 00:05:03,261
- It's like a science experiment.
- [Chloe's dad] Mm-hmm.

68
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:07,932
<i>We did 23andMe
because at the doctor's office,</i>

69
00:05:08,016 --> 00:05:12,562
<i>we cross out that entire section
of family-related health issues.</i>

70
00:05:14,188 --> 00:05:18,276
[Chloe's mom] I invited Chloe, probably,
20 times to go to Chinese dance.

71
00:05:18,359 --> 00:05:20,111
- No interest.
- [Chloe's dad chuckles]

72
00:05:20,194 --> 00:05:21,612
But when we found out

73
00:05:21,696 --> 00:05:23,865
that she had a cousin,

74
00:05:23,948 --> 00:05:25,199
a blood cousin,

75
00:05:25,283 --> 00:05:27,910
living in Tennessee,
who was roughly around her age...

76
00:05:27,994 --> 00:05:29,996
- That she was interested in.
- She was interested.

77
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:33,624
That and the fact that
she was related to Yo-Yo Ma distantly.

78
00:05:33,708 --> 00:05:34,708
[laughing] Yeah!

79
00:05:35,126 --> 00:05:37,086
[Chloe]<i> And that's how I found Sadie.</i>

80
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:40,048
<i>We've been Snapchatting
for the last few months.</i>

81
00:05:40,631 --> 00:05:42,175
- <i>Hey!</i>
- Hi!

82
00:05:43,134 --> 00:05:45,636
I think I was really surprised.

83
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:50,350
There are so many people in this world,
and to be connected to, like, Sadie

84
00:05:50,433 --> 00:05:51,934
was just shocking to me.

85
00:05:52,685 --> 00:05:55,438
[Sadie]<i> I just... I love animals.
They're adorable.</i>

86
00:05:55,521 --> 00:05:57,857
- Yeah, I so want a puppy.
<i>- Puppy works.</i>

87
00:05:57,940 --> 00:06:02,070
I always go through these phases,
like wanting a puppy or a...

88
00:06:02,153 --> 00:06:04,072
like, I don't know, bird.

89
00:06:04,155 --> 00:06:05,406
A hedgehog.

90
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:07,810
Like... But I always want them to be
like, my little, like,

91
00:06:07,867 --> 00:06:10,161
- sidekicks or whatever, like...
- [Sadie laughing]

92
00:06:10,244 --> 00:06:11,871
But it never works out, so...

93
00:06:14,457 --> 00:06:16,709
Why didn't you tell me
about any of these cousins?

94
00:06:16,793 --> 00:06:20,046
[Sadie's mom sighs deeply] I think I have,
and you haven't listened, but...

95
00:06:20,129 --> 00:06:21,756
Okay, here's Lily.

96
00:06:22,382 --> 00:06:24,759
Oh, you have
eight relatives in common too.

97
00:06:24,842 --> 00:06:25,885
Oh!

98
00:06:25,968 --> 00:06:29,138
Dear Lily, my name is Sadie.

99
00:06:29,722 --> 00:06:33,434
I live... in Tennessee,

100
00:06:33,518 --> 00:06:37,480
and I was adopted

101
00:06:37,563 --> 00:06:42,235
in the Guangdong Province.

102
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:45,071
Uh, here's how you spell that.

103
00:06:45,154 --> 00:06:46,489
[Sadie] Should I send?

104
00:06:46,572 --> 00:06:48,199
[Sadie's mom] Go ahead and send it.

105
00:06:48,282 --> 00:06:49,909
[Sadie] I only thought I had Chloe.

106
00:06:50,868 --> 00:06:52,620
- Hi!
- [Sadie] <i>Hey!</i>

107
00:06:52,703 --> 00:06:55,081
<i>Oh, my God!
I can't believe I'm finally meeting you.</i>

108
00:06:55,164 --> 00:06:57,291
[chuckling] I know, this is so cool.

109
00:06:57,375 --> 00:06:59,919
<i>- I like your necklace.</i>
- [Lily gasps] Thank you!

110
00:07:00,002 --> 00:07:03,089
<i>I literally just keep all my necklaces
on me, like, at all times.</i>

111
00:07:03,172 --> 00:07:05,258
<i>Like, I never take them off. Yeah, and so...</i>

112
00:07:05,341 --> 00:07:07,176
<i>- [woman] Show me the pictures.
- [Lily] Okay.</i>

113
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:10,346
Your new cousins.
Not your old cousins. [chuckles]

114
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:13,266
[Lily] Okay, that's Sadie.
Do we look alike?

115
00:07:13,349 --> 00:07:14,559
[Lori] Mm-hmm.

116
00:07:14,642 --> 00:07:16,362
- [man] A little bit, maybe.
- [Lori] Maybe?

117
00:07:16,394 --> 00:07:19,063
I see some resemblance there, I think.

118
00:07:20,523 --> 00:07:22,275
[Lily] I decided to do a DNA test

119
00:07:22,358 --> 00:07:27,029
'cause I wanted to find more
about who I am and my past.

120
00:07:28,030 --> 00:07:30,241
When I heard from Sadie,

121
00:07:30,324 --> 00:07:31,951
it opened up new ideas to, like...

122
00:07:32,618 --> 00:07:33,953
About, like, our adoption.

123
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:36,247
[line ringing]

124
00:07:42,253 --> 00:07:43,713
[Lily] Is this working?

125
00:07:43,796 --> 00:07:45,256
- [gasps] Got it.
- Oh, hey!

126
00:07:45,339 --> 00:07:47,008
- [chuckling]
- Hi!

127
00:07:47,091 --> 00:07:48,593
- Hi!
- [Sadie] Hey!

128
00:07:48,676 --> 00:07:49,969
Oh my God, this is so cool.

129
00:07:50,052 --> 00:07:52,680
I've never done, like,
Google Hangout like this.

130
00:07:52,763 --> 00:07:54,682
So, how are your lives going?

131
00:07:54,765 --> 00:07:56,559
I'm looking forward to Friday.

132
00:07:56,642 --> 00:07:58,603
It's been, like, the longest week,

133
00:07:59,437 --> 00:08:01,105
and I don't like it.

134
00:08:01,189 --> 00:08:05,067
[Sadie] Don't worry, I was struggling too.
I feel like we're all tired.

135
00:08:05,151 --> 00:08:09,155
I've also thought about, "Okay,
where do I begin with my life story?"

136
00:08:09,238 --> 00:08:12,116
- I guess we could start really, beginning...
- [Chloe] Yeah.

137
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:16,579
Yeah, we were all in an orphanage
in the southern part of China.

138
00:08:16,662 --> 00:08:19,790
I guess it's, like, Guangzhao,
I guess in that area, maybe.

139
00:08:19,874 --> 00:08:22,210
- [Lily] Guangzhou. Yes.
- [Sadie] Oh!

140
00:08:22,293 --> 00:08:24,629
[Chloe] Wait, we were from
the same orphanage?

141
00:08:24,712 --> 00:08:26,547
Yes, Chloe, you and I were.

142
00:08:26,631 --> 00:08:30,009
Yeah, it's kinda cool.
It's not "kinda," it's pretty cool.

143
00:08:30,092 --> 00:08:31,469
- [chuckles]
- [Sadie] Yeah.

144
00:08:31,552 --> 00:08:34,222
You know, though, I thought about it,
like, in the past,

145
00:08:34,305 --> 00:08:36,599
like, why they might have abandoned me.

146
00:08:36,682 --> 00:08:40,937
And I just kind of thought it was
because of that one-child rule in China.

147
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:42,020
[girls] Yeah.

148
00:08:42,396 --> 00:08:43,814
I feel like I don't really, like,

149
00:08:43,898 --> 00:08:46,526
truly know the reason.
Like, that's just what they assume.

150
00:08:46,609 --> 00:08:47,609
Oh, yeah.

151
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:57,328
[Sadie's mom] So, that'd be
your great-great-grandfather.

152
00:08:58,079 --> 00:09:00,540
That's Uncle Sam.
Must be when he joined the military.

153
00:09:01,499 --> 00:09:03,501
We've put flowers on his grave.

154
00:09:04,252 --> 00:09:07,129
That's a picture of your great-grandmother
when she was a baby.

155
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:11,217
She came from Ireland.
I've got a quilt she made in 1840.

156
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:12,301
[Sadie] That's cool.

157
00:09:13,886 --> 00:09:15,054
James Franklin.

158
00:09:15,763 --> 00:09:19,433
He would have been
a great-great-great grandfather.

159
00:09:20,226 --> 00:09:23,771
On my dad's side,
we can go back to almost 900.

160
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:25,773
Um, Mom's side,

161
00:09:25,856 --> 00:09:28,568
eh, it's more spread out and varied,

162
00:09:28,651 --> 00:09:31,654
but we have it
back to around 1600, I think.

163
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:36,492
Then this'd be Anna Fulton,
the one who died from tuberculosis.

164
00:09:37,827 --> 00:09:40,830
[Sadie] I don't necessarily
feel connected to them.

165
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:46,043
I know that's part of my family,
but technically they have no ties to me.

166
00:09:46,127 --> 00:09:48,379
[Victoria] That's my mom and my aunt.

167
00:09:48,462 --> 00:09:52,300
[Sadie] The orphanage told my mom
that I was left in a box

168
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:54,969
near a busy street.

169
00:09:55,052 --> 00:09:58,347
I imagined it
being really early in the morning.

170
00:09:59,265 --> 00:10:01,934
Someone found me
and took me to the orphanage.

171
00:10:02,810 --> 00:10:05,688
Sometimes, I'm like,
"Whoa, they're out there."

172
00:10:05,771 --> 00:10:09,191
"Like, I might have,
like, siblings out there."

173
00:10:10,901 --> 00:10:14,322
It's kind of weird to think, like,
how different my life would be.

174
00:10:18,034 --> 00:10:20,369
[Victoria] <i>When Sadie was probably
two or three years old,</i>

175
00:10:20,453 --> 00:10:23,789
<i>I decided that
I'm gonna do the DNA on her.</i>

176
00:10:23,873 --> 00:10:26,167
<i>I wanted to find her biological family</i>

177
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:30,796
<i>because I want her to at least
have the opportunity to know her history.</i>

178
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,256
<i>But it didn't happen.</i>

179
00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:38,095
<i>Sadie... I think she struggles sometimes
between, "I want to know all this"</i>

180
00:10:38,179 --> 00:10:40,848
<i>and "I just want to be
a typical teenager."</i>

181
00:10:40,931 --> 00:10:43,476
Uh, may I try the goat cheese
with red cherries?

182
00:10:45,019 --> 00:10:48,147
[Sadie] <i>Yeah, I feel like
being adopted isn't my identity.</i>

183
00:10:49,106 --> 00:10:52,485
<i>Just like your middle name,
not that many people know about it,</i>

184
00:10:52,568 --> 00:10:54,236
<i>but it's there.</i>

185
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,155
[friend] You were holding your phone up...

186
00:10:56,238 --> 00:10:57,406
[laughing]

187
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,576
[friend] Can you speak Chinese?

188
00:11:03,871 --> 00:11:05,706
I mean, you used to live there.

189
00:11:07,041 --> 00:11:10,169
[Sadie] What origins are you?
Like, what's your...

190
00:11:10,252 --> 00:11:11,692
- [chuckles]
- [friend] I'm Hispanic.

191
00:11:11,754 --> 00:11:15,049
- I lived in Ecuador for, like, two years.
- Do you speak Spanish?

192
00:11:15,841 --> 00:11:17,927
[Sadie] So, a friend's dad, he's Chinese.

193
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:20,846
He comes up to me
and starts speaking to me in Chinese.

194
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:22,932
I'm like, "Sorry, I don't know Chinese."

195
00:11:23,015 --> 00:11:25,893
And he just looked so disappointed
and walked away from me.

196
00:11:25,976 --> 00:11:29,355
He completely stopped talking to me.
I was like, "Nice to meet you too."

197
00:11:30,356 --> 00:11:31,816
[friend] We did for the first...

198
00:11:31,899 --> 00:11:34,276
[Sadie] I honestly don't feel Chinese.

199
00:11:35,736 --> 00:11:39,824
So many of my friends call me a "banana."
They're like, "Sadie, you act so white."

200
00:11:39,907 --> 00:11:43,411
"Like, you are, like, the whitest
Chinese person I've ever met."

201
00:11:43,494 --> 00:11:44,912
[laughing]

202
00:11:44,995 --> 00:11:45,830
I don't know.

203
00:11:45,913 --> 00:11:48,833
I've just always
identified myself as an American.

204
00:11:50,543 --> 00:11:54,213
[woman] Hello, and welcome
to the 8th grade Hebrew play!

205
00:11:54,296 --> 00:11:56,507
[crowd cheering and applauding]

206
00:11:56,590 --> 00:11:58,592
[music playing]

207
00:11:59,468 --> 00:12:02,722
[singing "Let it Go" in Hebrew]

208
00:12:06,934 --> 00:12:09,437
[Gene] <i>I think Chloe appreciates
her Jewish education,</i>

209
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:10,563
<i>but she's had enough.</i>

210
00:12:11,439 --> 00:12:16,944
<i>She made clear that she was not going
to a Jewish school henceforth.</i>

211
00:12:17,027 --> 00:12:18,320
[students vocalizing]

212
00:12:18,404 --> 00:12:20,489
[Chloe] <i>We're moving
to Phoenix next month,</i>

213
00:12:20,573 --> 00:12:22,783
<i>and I'm going to attend high school.</i>

214
00:12:23,701 --> 00:12:25,911
<i>I wanted the school to have Mandarin.</i>

215
00:12:25,995 --> 00:12:28,956
<i>I don't think I had
any other requirements, really.</i>

216
00:12:29,039 --> 00:12:30,416
[singing indistinctly]

217
00:12:30,499 --> 00:12:36,046
I've gone to Jewish Day School
for, I don't know, 9 years or something.

218
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:40,050
I had a theology class and today
she was like, "Do you believe in God?"

219
00:12:40,134 --> 00:12:42,261
Raise your hands, who believes in God.

220
00:12:42,344 --> 00:12:44,472
And I didn't raise my hand.

221
00:12:44,555 --> 00:12:46,849
Yeah, I get that. That's hard.

222
00:12:46,932 --> 00:12:49,101
I've always gone to church and stuff,

223
00:12:49,185 --> 00:12:53,189
but lately, I've just kind of
lost touch with, uh, like, faith in God.

224
00:12:53,773 --> 00:12:55,274
I think I believe in Him though,

225
00:12:55,357 --> 00:12:59,111
but I mean, there's always just that
uncertain doubt in the back of my mind.

226
00:12:59,612 --> 00:13:00,821
I do believe in God,

227
00:13:00,905 --> 00:13:03,908
because, like, I've been surrounded
by people that love and support me.

228
00:13:03,991 --> 00:13:07,369
So, like, I think, like, you can see God
through, like, other people.

229
00:13:07,453 --> 00:13:11,207
I feel like I'm still
just trying to find out who I am.

230
00:13:15,169 --> 00:13:17,797
- [man] Nĭ hăo!
- [Chloe] <i>Nĭ hăo!</i>

231
00:13:18,964 --> 00:13:21,550
<i>- Okay, let's... Are you ready?</i>
- [Chloe] Yeah.

232
00:13:22,259 --> 00:13:24,512
I hadn't really thought about it much,

233
00:13:24,595 --> 00:13:29,308
that I was, like, one of the only Asians
in the communities I had been in.

234
00:13:29,809 --> 00:13:32,061
[man] <i>How do you say,
"She's gone shopping"?</i>

235
00:13:32,144 --> 00:13:35,731
[speaking Mandarin]

236
00:13:35,815 --> 00:13:37,775
But, as I grew,

237
00:13:37,858 --> 00:13:40,736
I just realized there was, like,
more in the world, I guess,

238
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:43,781
and I just wanted to find more people

239
00:13:43,864 --> 00:13:46,700
that I could relate to
and that looked like me.

240
00:13:50,246 --> 00:13:54,917
When you're little, like, you grow up
in, like, your perfect little bubble.

241
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,586
You grow up around all these,
like, white people, and like,

242
00:13:57,670 --> 00:13:59,839
it's just... who you think you are.

243
00:13:59,922 --> 00:14:02,174
And then, like,
you realize you're different.

244
00:14:04,218 --> 00:14:06,512
A close friend of mine...
We were really close.

245
00:14:06,595 --> 00:14:09,390
It was middle school.
I was the only Asian kid.

246
00:14:09,974 --> 00:14:14,019
And she said that, like,
some very hurtful things about, like...

247
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:17,439
[sniffling]

248
00:14:30,703 --> 00:14:31,704
About, like...

249
00:14:35,666 --> 00:14:39,253
like, my birth parents
maybe not wanting me,

250
00:14:39,336 --> 00:14:42,047
and that's why they gave me up. [sobbing]

251
00:14:43,924 --> 00:14:46,093
[voice shuddering]
I just wasn't expecting it,

252
00:14:46,594 --> 00:14:48,554
and it was just too much.

253
00:14:51,265 --> 00:14:52,975
[tutor] <i>Repeat after me, please.</i>

254
00:14:53,058 --> 00:14:54,143
[tutor speaks Mandarin]

255
00:14:54,685 --> 00:14:56,061
[repeating in Mandarin]

256
00:14:57,730 --> 00:14:59,189
[tutor speaks Mandarin]

257
00:14:59,273 --> 00:15:00,983
[repeating in Mandarin]

258
00:15:09,950 --> 00:15:13,370
If you look over here, like,
all my medals are over here

259
00:15:13,454 --> 00:15:15,789
in like, basketball and volleyball.

260
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:18,918
My grade voted me, my senior year,

261
00:15:19,001 --> 00:15:23,172
to, like, represent, like, my senior class
as, like, the senior attendant.

262
00:15:23,255 --> 00:15:26,300
And, like, so like, it has, like,
my name on the back.

263
00:15:26,383 --> 00:15:31,722
I have applied to OU,
OSU, UCO, and Creighton.

264
00:15:32,348 --> 00:15:35,142
I already heard from OSU. It's...

265
00:15:37,019 --> 00:15:39,480
[marching band music playing]

266
00:15:43,067 --> 00:15:47,112
So, I can't go out of state my first year
because of my jaw surgery.

267
00:15:47,196 --> 00:15:49,823
I'm getting jaw surgery in June,

268
00:15:49,907 --> 00:15:52,868
and they're going to
crack my jaw and like, push it back.

269
00:15:53,994 --> 00:15:56,038
I think the transformation will be weird

270
00:15:56,121 --> 00:15:58,082
'cause I feel like
I won't look like myself.

271
00:15:58,165 --> 00:16:00,960
But like, also, like... it is me.

272
00:16:02,211 --> 00:16:05,714
[crowd] Bless us, O Lord, in these,
Thy gifts, which we are about to receive

273
00:16:05,798 --> 00:16:08,884
from Thy bounty,
through Christ our Lord. Amen!

274
00:16:10,886 --> 00:16:15,683
[Lily] I am an only child
to a single mother

275
00:16:15,766 --> 00:16:18,018
with a big Catholic family,

276
00:16:18,102 --> 00:16:20,646
and I have 15 first cousins.

277
00:16:21,855 --> 00:16:27,111
My mom lived in various places,
New York, Nicaragua, Connecticut...

278
00:16:27,194 --> 00:16:29,196
but when I was one,

279
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:32,533
she moved in with my grandparents,
to help raise me.

280
00:16:32,616 --> 00:16:33,867
[Deborah] I didn't forget that.

281
00:16:34,618 --> 00:16:35,661
That was for you.

282
00:16:36,453 --> 00:16:39,415
[Lily] Some people ask me,
"When did you find out you were adopted?"

283
00:16:39,498 --> 00:16:41,083
Like, "When was the big reveal?"

284
00:16:41,667 --> 00:16:43,377
It was never a reveal.

285
00:16:45,129 --> 00:16:48,382
My mom, when I was younger,
she always had these books.

286
00:16:49,091 --> 00:16:52,011
So she would, like, read me books
all, like, the time.

287
00:16:53,470 --> 00:16:56,015
Yeah, here's one,
<i>When You Were Born in China,</i>

288
00:16:56,849 --> 00:16:58,434
that I loved when I was little,

289
00:16:58,517 --> 00:17:02,021
and I'd even be like, "Mom, can you
re-read that, like, again?" So...

290
00:17:08,986 --> 00:17:10,529
- [whispering] Hi, honey.
- [Lily] Hi.

291
00:17:10,612 --> 00:17:11,612
We gotta go.

292
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:13,532
- Okay?
- Okay, let's go.

293
00:17:17,453 --> 00:17:18,662
[Deborah] <i>It's genetic.</i>

294
00:17:18,746 --> 00:17:19,580
[Lily] Thank you.

295
00:17:19,663 --> 00:17:23,500
[Deborah] <i>What the doctors have said is,
you had a mom and a dad that got together.</i>

296
00:17:23,584 --> 00:17:26,378
<i>And somebody had a short jaw,
and somebody had a long jaw.</i>

297
00:17:26,462 --> 00:17:29,923
<i>And that's just kind of... the way it goes.</i>

298
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:33,135
Aunt Laurie and Uncle Mike are coming too.

299
00:17:33,218 --> 00:17:36,013
- Uncle Mike won't come until after work.
- [Lily] Okay.

300
00:17:38,265 --> 00:17:40,517
My jaw was an insecurity I had,

301
00:17:40,601 --> 00:17:42,978
but also, it's who I am.

302
00:17:43,062 --> 00:17:45,564
It's like, part of what...
It's what my birth parents, like...

303
00:17:45,647 --> 00:17:47,483
You know, it's what I got from them.

304
00:17:49,359 --> 00:17:54,114
I have a lot of questions
about my life in China when I was little.

305
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:56,240
Lily?

306
00:17:57,076 --> 00:17:59,995
I mean, 13 months doesn't sound
like a lot, but it's kinda...

307
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:01,288
It's... It's...

308
00:18:01,371 --> 00:18:03,415
To me, it's kind of, like, a lot. Like...

309
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:06,335
It's definitely, like,
a big part of, like...

310
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:09,963
It's just, like, kind of like a mystery.
Like, I feel like I'll never know.

311
00:18:11,715 --> 00:18:13,801
My mom, she's my rock.

312
00:18:14,885 --> 00:18:18,972
I don't want my mom to kind of feel
like I don't love her 'cause I do.

313
00:18:20,265 --> 00:18:21,391
[Deborah] Goodbye, sweetie.

314
00:18:21,475 --> 00:18:24,478
[nurse] We'll take excellent care of her,
you guys. Thank you.

315
00:18:24,561 --> 00:18:28,357
[Lily] I don't want to die where
I don't know who my birth parents are.

316
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:44,248
I've been told
I, like, look older with the new face.

317
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:46,875
I went to the pool for work,

318
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:49,545
and like, a lot of my friends
work there as lifeguards.

319
00:18:49,628 --> 00:18:51,964
They knew it was me,
but they, like, weren't sure.

320
00:18:52,506 --> 00:18:56,844
Hi. Can I get a three-finger combo
with a Dr. Pepper?

321
00:18:57,636 --> 00:18:59,012
Look. Before and after.

322
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:03,433
Ew, I hate that one.

323
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:09,898
Just kind of growing up, if I think
about it, if there's resemblances...

324
00:19:10,566 --> 00:19:12,109
I kind of get your struggle.

325
00:19:12,192 --> 00:19:14,027
'Cause, you know how everyone's like,

326
00:19:14,111 --> 00:19:16,196
"Oh, don't you resemble
someone in your family?"

327
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:18,907
And it's like, "My family's white, honey."

328
00:19:18,991 --> 00:19:20,701
Mmm, yeah.

329
00:19:20,784 --> 00:19:24,538
Would you want to meet your birth family
or look for them? I would not.

330
00:19:24,621 --> 00:19:25,956
I think that'd be so freaky.

331
00:19:26,039 --> 00:19:26,874
I... I don't know.

332
00:19:26,957 --> 00:19:30,294
I think it would be nice to, like,
know who our real parents are

333
00:19:30,377 --> 00:19:34,673
and, like, visit our hometown
and see where we're from.

334
00:19:34,756 --> 00:19:38,635
I think it would be nice
to know the whole reason for everything.

335
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:40,720
That's so true.

336
00:19:44,183 --> 00:19:45,267
[Deborah] Whatcha got?

337
00:19:47,477 --> 00:19:48,477
Let's see.

338
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:52,357
[Lily] It's a history and travel group.

339
00:19:52,941 --> 00:19:58,113
Sounds very similar to the Chinese version
of the ancestry tours

340
00:19:58,197 --> 00:20:00,115
that girls are going on.

341
00:20:00,699 --> 00:20:02,492
So they just immerse you in...

342
00:20:02,576 --> 00:20:08,207
Yeah, you go and learn about
the culture and go back to your village.

343
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:11,210
And, like, I think they help you
find your birth parents.

344
00:20:11,293 --> 00:20:13,730
- [Deborah] Mm-hmm.
- [Susie] So what do you think about that?

345
00:20:13,754 --> 00:20:16,173
[Lily] There's pros and cons
to the whole thing.

346
00:20:16,256 --> 00:20:19,760
But either way, like, there's gonna be,
like, a lot of emotions towards it.

347
00:20:19,843 --> 00:20:20,843
[Susie] Yeah.

348
00:20:21,511 --> 00:20:24,223
[Lily] I am talking to...

349
00:20:24,306 --> 00:20:25,349
Was it her?

350
00:20:25,432 --> 00:20:28,769
"Liu Hao is a native
of Western Guangdong Province

351
00:20:28,852 --> 00:20:31,563
and speaks Hakka,
Cantonese, Mandarin and English."

352
00:20:32,272 --> 00:20:35,901
"Between flipping
through centuries-old <i>zupus</i>

353
00:20:35,984 --> 00:20:38,779
for clues and tracking down
elusive ancestors,

354
00:20:38,862 --> 00:20:42,950
Liu Hao likes to meditate, read novels,
and watch high-stake thrillers."

355
00:20:43,533 --> 00:20:45,661
[Susie] So, tonight,
you're gonna talk to her?

356
00:20:46,954 --> 00:20:48,830
- [Lily] Yep.
- [Liu] <i>Hello?</i>

357
00:20:48,914 --> 00:20:50,234
- [Deborah] Hello.
- [Lily] Hello.

358
00:20:50,958 --> 00:20:52,292
[Liu] <i>Yes, I can hear you.</i>

359
00:20:52,376 --> 00:20:55,379
- Yes, hi. Oh, you're beautiful.
- Hi!

360
00:20:56,046 --> 00:20:58,048
<i>Oh, thanks.</i> [giggling]

361
00:20:58,131 --> 00:21:00,092
It means a lot to me.

362
00:21:00,175 --> 00:21:02,010
You are the first girl

363
00:21:02,094 --> 00:21:04,721
<i>I know that came
from the same place like me.</i>

364
00:21:04,805 --> 00:21:05,931
<i>From my hometown.</i>

365
00:21:06,014 --> 00:21:08,684
[Deborah] <i>Oh, that's your ancestral place?</i>

366
00:21:08,767 --> 00:21:10,352
Yeah. Exactly.

367
00:21:10,435 --> 00:21:12,187
<i>- Exactly.</i>
- That's cool.

368
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:15,774
<i>Let's start with our research goals.</i>

369
00:21:15,857 --> 00:21:19,236
<i>You want to find your biological parents,</i>

370
00:21:19,319 --> 00:21:21,238
<i>and another goal is,</i>

371
00:21:21,321 --> 00:21:26,368
<i>we want to locate those individuals
that appeared in your early life,</i>

372
00:21:26,451 --> 00:21:29,621
<i>like the nanny who took you to Guangzhao.</i>

373
00:21:29,705 --> 00:21:30,622
Yeah.

374
00:21:30,706 --> 00:21:34,501
The chances to end up
finding the biological parents

375
00:21:34,584 --> 00:21:36,962
is very, very small.

376
00:21:37,045 --> 00:21:39,506
Do you think the chances
are slim because, like,

377
00:21:40,090 --> 00:21:44,344
the parents are, like,
afraid to, like... step up?

378
00:21:44,428 --> 00:21:46,680
'Cause, like they're...
Will they get in trouble?

379
00:21:46,763 --> 00:21:49,141
[Liu]
<i>I think they don't want get in trouble,</i>

380
00:21:49,224 --> 00:21:51,393
<i>but, you know, emotionally... Not...</i>

381
00:21:51,476 --> 00:21:54,271
The truth is always painful
because, you know,

382
00:21:54,354 --> 00:21:56,565
the parents who forced to,

383
00:21:56,648 --> 00:21:59,943
um, give up their children,
maybe, just feel shame.

384
00:22:00,610 --> 00:22:02,154
<i>What do you want to see,</i>

385
00:22:02,237 --> 00:22:04,197
<i>or where do you want to hang out?</i>

386
00:22:04,281 --> 00:22:06,783
I wouldn't mind
going back to my orphanage.

387
00:22:07,909 --> 00:22:11,038
[Chloe] Did the lady ask you
what you wanted to do and stuff?

388
00:22:11,121 --> 00:22:13,957
[Lily] <i>Pandas.
I want to be with, like, pandas.</i>

389
00:22:14,041 --> 00:22:17,461
[Sadie] <i>Oh, yeah! Do you think
we could pet a panda, maybe?</i>

390
00:22:17,544 --> 00:22:19,254
[all chuckling]

391
00:22:19,963 --> 00:22:23,925
We're more interested
in being "tourists" in China

392
00:22:24,009 --> 00:22:26,845
and learning the culture,
learning the food.

393
00:22:27,512 --> 00:22:30,891
[Chloe] <i>I don't really, like,
want to find my birth parents, so...</i>

394
00:22:31,641 --> 00:22:35,395
But would you want to meet
the ladies who helped take care of you?

395
00:22:35,479 --> 00:22:36,646
[Gene] In the orphanage?

396
00:22:36,730 --> 00:22:38,231
[Chloe] Yeah, that seems cool.

397
00:22:38,899 --> 00:22:43,153
[Sari] We were gonna
do this trip to China on our own,

398
00:22:43,236 --> 00:22:46,740
but then the idea
of doing it with Lily and Sadie,

399
00:22:47,616 --> 00:22:51,203
for me, it made
the potential difficult parts of the trip

400
00:22:51,286 --> 00:22:52,579
much more doable.

401
00:22:53,163 --> 00:22:57,125
I'm taking Mandarin over the summer,
so I don't totally suck.

402
00:22:57,793 --> 00:23:01,254
[Sadie] <i>Nice. I should probably learn
Mandarin, since we're going to China.</i>

403
00:23:02,130 --> 00:23:06,051
Do you guys have any special places
where you want to go?

404
00:23:06,134 --> 00:23:08,637
I... I want to visit
the Great Wall of China.

405
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:11,264
I'm... I'm pretty sure
we're definitely doing that.

406
00:23:11,348 --> 00:23:16,478
I'm helping Lily
to look for her birth parents.

407
00:23:16,561 --> 00:23:20,649
Do you also want me
to help you to do that?

408
00:23:20,732 --> 00:23:21,732
Yeah.

409
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:24,528
[Liu] <i>I love this job.</i>

410
00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:30,033
<i>I believe looking
for one's lost history is important.</i>

411
00:23:30,617 --> 00:23:33,703
When you know your family history,
when you know where you come from,

412
00:23:33,787 --> 00:23:36,039
you can find the peace in your heart.

413
00:23:41,002 --> 00:23:44,923
<i>I grew up in a small town in Guangdong.</i>

414
00:23:45,757 --> 00:23:49,761
<i>In college, I studied International
Economics and Trades,</i>

415
00:23:49,845 --> 00:23:54,975
<i>and then I moved to Beijing,
and I become a genealogy researcher.</i>

416
00:24:00,355 --> 00:24:03,066
<i>So, my job is to track down those people</i>

417
00:24:03,150 --> 00:24:07,320
<i>who might have connection
with Lily, Sadie and Chloe.</i>

418
00:24:08,989 --> 00:24:11,783
I feel like we can
call ourselves, like, detectives,

419
00:24:11,867 --> 00:24:14,411
'cause we always
looking for the new clues,

420
00:24:15,036 --> 00:24:18,290
and, uh, every project is very different.

421
00:24:18,999 --> 00:24:22,210
I put ads on Baby Come Home...

422
00:24:22,294 --> 00:24:24,588
social media, television.

423
00:24:25,464 --> 00:24:29,342
I'm really looking forward
to see who gonna respond to this.

424
00:24:29,426 --> 00:24:30,927
[line ringing]

425
00:24:31,011 --> 00:24:34,181
[in Cantonese] She was taken
to Huazhou Welfare Institute

426
00:24:34,264 --> 00:24:36,641
around December, 1999.

427
00:24:36,725 --> 00:24:38,810
[man 1 on phone]
<i>You gotta be more detailed...</i>

428
00:24:38,894 --> 00:24:40,020
[line ringing]

429
00:24:40,103 --> 00:24:43,982
I know it's like
finding a needle in a haystack, but...

430
00:24:44,065 --> 00:24:47,652
[man 1] <i>Of course
it's impossible to find them.</i>

431
00:24:47,736 --> 00:24:49,696
Yes, I know it's quite difficult.

432
00:24:49,779 --> 00:24:53,450
[man 1] <i>No, it's impossible.
You're talking about ancient history.</i>

433
00:24:53,533 --> 00:24:56,286
[in English] They did tell you
they don't have any records...

434
00:24:56,369 --> 00:24:59,164
[Victoria] <i>No, no, no.
They did have records at that point.</i>

435
00:24:59,247 --> 00:25:02,250
[man 1 in Cantonese]
<i>No, we don't keep such records.</i>

436
00:25:02,334 --> 00:25:04,336
[line ringing]

437
00:25:06,796 --> 00:25:08,507
[phone ringing]

438
00:25:09,049 --> 00:25:12,344
[in Cantonese] Someone told my mom
a baby photo online

439
00:25:12,427 --> 00:25:15,013
looked like me and my sister.

440
00:25:16,056 --> 00:25:19,351
[Liu in English]
Well, she could be Lily's sister.

441
00:25:19,434 --> 00:25:22,646
Her home is very close
to Lily's finding place.

442
00:25:23,146 --> 00:25:25,190
[woman in Cantonese]
<i>I had to give birth secretly.</i>

443
00:25:25,273 --> 00:25:28,193
<i>I don't know
where the midwife sent the baby.</i>

444
00:25:28,777 --> 00:25:32,239
[Deborah in English] <i>This is the auntie.
She came with the director.</i>

445
00:25:32,322 --> 00:25:33,740
I can see that. Thanks.

446
00:25:33,823 --> 00:25:36,910
[in Cantonese] Let's see if you recognize
the nanny in the photo.

447
00:25:55,428 --> 00:25:58,473
[indistinct chatter]

448
00:25:59,724 --> 00:26:01,764
[friend 1 in English]
I didn't know you were Jewish.

449
00:26:02,352 --> 00:26:05,480
A lot of people don't.
I told my tennis coach that I was Jewish.

450
00:26:05,564 --> 00:26:09,609
He's like, "No, you're not. You're Asian."
And I'm like, "I'm a Jewish Asian."

451
00:26:10,193 --> 00:26:11,193
[friend 2] Yeah.

452
00:26:11,695 --> 00:26:13,113
[friend 1] My mom's Greek Orthodox,

453
00:26:13,196 --> 00:26:15,865
so when I say I'm Greek,
it doesn't make any sense.

454
00:26:15,949 --> 00:26:18,785
But, like, how were you found?
Did someone deliver you?

455
00:26:18,868 --> 00:26:23,623
Oh, I was found on, um, a busy street.
I have a picture. But I really don't...

456
00:26:23,707 --> 00:26:25,083
Someone took a picture?

457
00:26:25,166 --> 00:26:28,878
- Yeah, they were exploring Guangzhou.
- Why not? I was found on a bench.

458
00:26:28,962 --> 00:26:31,256
- On a bench?
- In, like, a busy marketplace.

459
00:26:31,339 --> 00:26:32,173
Oh, my God!

460
00:26:32,257 --> 00:26:34,551
[friend 1] Do you know
what's your real birthday?

461
00:26:34,634 --> 00:26:35,468
[Chloe] Honestly, no.

462
00:26:35,552 --> 00:26:38,888
[friend 1] I thought I came with like,
a little tag or something, but my mom,

463
00:26:38,972 --> 00:26:40,432
she was like, "They guessed."

464
00:26:40,515 --> 00:26:42,434
And I feel so sad because I'm like...

465
00:26:42,517 --> 00:26:45,854
I'm like, "November 2nd, my birthday,
two days after Halloween, I'm a Scorpio."

466
00:26:45,937 --> 00:26:46,771
I'm like...

467
00:26:46,855 --> 00:26:49,274
But then I'm like, "It might not be real."

468
00:26:49,774 --> 00:26:51,276
I mean, it can't be that off.

469
00:26:51,359 --> 00:26:55,488
[friend 1] I know, but still. Just...
'Cause I did the 23andMe thing too.

470
00:26:56,114 --> 00:26:59,117
But I haven't done anything.
But that's cool that you found them.

471
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:03,038
[Chloe] Yeah, Sadie's trying to find
her parents, Lily's trying to find hers,

472
00:27:03,121 --> 00:27:04,121
and then I'm not.

473
00:27:04,581 --> 00:27:05,874
You're not gonna try?

474
00:27:06,541 --> 00:27:07,542
No.

475
00:27:07,626 --> 00:27:10,462
- 'Cause you don't want to or just...
- I do, but also, like, not.

476
00:27:10,545 --> 00:27:12,130
But where would you even start?

477
00:27:12,213 --> 00:27:15,050
Oh, the people... The tour people are like,
"We do this all the time."

478
00:27:15,133 --> 00:27:18,845
And then they put a picture of you
out on the street, and then people call,

479
00:27:18,928 --> 00:27:21,288
- and they're like, "That's my baby."
- But you were a baby.

480
00:27:22,182 --> 00:27:24,434
- What?
- [boy] Are you meeting your mom?

481
00:27:24,517 --> 00:27:27,020
Um, I'm not looking
for my biological parents.

482
00:27:27,103 --> 00:27:28,521
But my cousins are.

483
00:27:28,605 --> 00:27:29,814
- [boy] Oh, no way.
- Yeah.

484
00:27:29,898 --> 00:27:32,984
[man]
Go! Let's go, guys, let's go! Let's go!

485
00:27:33,068 --> 00:27:34,361
[crowd cheering]

486
00:27:34,444 --> 00:27:37,238
[shaker rattling]

487
00:27:37,322 --> 00:27:40,200
[Chloe] Sometimes I do wanna meet them,

488
00:27:40,283 --> 00:27:42,744
but most of the time I just, like... don't.

489
00:27:44,663 --> 00:27:46,915
'Cause I think that'd just be,
like, scary, so...

490
00:27:46,998 --> 00:27:49,209
[interviewer]
What would be scary about that?

491
00:27:49,292 --> 00:27:51,795
I don't know,
just, like, meeting them and, like...

492
00:27:53,213 --> 00:27:54,213
I don't know.

493
00:27:55,048 --> 00:27:58,259
I don't know. It just seems... weird.

494
00:27:59,302 --> 00:28:01,471
Like, not meant to be, maybe? Like...

495
00:28:03,098 --> 00:28:04,098
Yeah.

496
00:28:05,266 --> 00:28:07,977
[Gene] She has no interest in,
at least at this time,

497
00:28:08,061 --> 00:28:11,690
in finding her birth parents,
because if she does that,

498
00:28:11,773 --> 00:28:13,566
then she has to start opening up

499
00:28:13,650 --> 00:28:17,696
and make herself vulnerable
to she knows not what.

500
00:28:17,779 --> 00:28:19,280
And she's not interested.

501
00:28:19,364 --> 00:28:22,200
And I think the fundamental
question remains the same.

502
00:28:22,283 --> 00:28:23,284
[crowd cheering]

503
00:28:23,410 --> 00:28:25,412
[Sari] Why was I given up?

504
00:28:25,495 --> 00:28:30,166
And I think she felt like it was just
not something she would want to deal with.

505
00:28:32,377 --> 00:28:34,504
She doesn't wanna go there.

506
00:28:36,923 --> 00:28:39,843
It stresses me out.
I don't know if I'd want that.

507
00:28:39,926 --> 00:28:40,760
[Lily] I get that.

508
00:28:40,844 --> 00:28:42,679
It's a lot to handle.

509
00:28:43,304 --> 00:28:44,597
Do you want to or no?

510
00:28:44,681 --> 00:28:46,266
I don't mind digging deep.

511
00:28:46,349 --> 00:28:50,145
Like, I... you know, with the mindset like,
"I could possibly meet my parents."

512
00:28:50,228 --> 00:28:51,438
Yeah.

513
00:28:51,521 --> 00:28:54,065
But is it really worth it?

514
00:28:54,149 --> 00:28:55,984
[Lily] I think so. Or I guess, like...

515
00:28:56,067 --> 00:28:58,862
I don't know. I guess since
you don't want to, like, or, like...

516
00:28:58,945 --> 00:29:03,324
If Sadie and I do find them,
then it's a connection to ours.

517
00:29:03,408 --> 00:29:04,492
Yeah.

518
00:29:04,576 --> 00:29:07,537
But we'll see how that goes.

519
00:29:12,834 --> 00:29:14,711
[phone ringing]

520
00:29:16,504 --> 00:29:17,504
[Sadie] Hello!

521
00:29:18,006 --> 00:29:20,008
- [Victoria] Hi!
- [Liu] <i>How was your day?</i>

522
00:29:20,091 --> 00:29:20,967
<i>Good.</i>

523
00:29:21,050 --> 00:29:21,885
<i>Yeah.</i>

524
00:29:21,968 --> 00:29:26,055
Yeah, so some people respond
to my ad, and, um,

525
00:29:26,139 --> 00:29:29,684
and I think there is a small chance
that they could be, you know,

526
00:29:29,768 --> 00:29:31,352
have a relationship to you.

527
00:29:31,436 --> 00:29:33,938
- So, you see a man's face.
- [Sadie] Ah.

528
00:29:34,022 --> 00:29:36,316
He and his wife, they are farmers,

529
00:29:36,399 --> 00:29:40,403
and they live
in a very small, um, remote village.

530
00:29:40,487 --> 00:29:47,035
<i>They gave up their second daughter,
who has a birthdate similar to Sadie's.</i>

531
00:29:47,619 --> 00:29:52,457
I want to ask you to create
a video of yourself for me to use.

532
00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:55,460
<i>Because some people,
they don't believe you are real...</i>

533
00:29:55,543 --> 00:29:58,171
- Yeah. No, we'll get that to you.
- Yeah.

534
00:29:58,254 --> 00:30:00,900
<i>- Thank you for all your help.</i>
- [Victoria] <i>Thanks for the pictures.</i>

535
00:30:00,924 --> 00:30:01,924
<i>- Bye!</i>
- Bye!

536
00:30:03,384 --> 00:30:04,384
[Sadie]<i> Bye!</i>

537
00:30:06,262 --> 00:30:08,932
That was a lot to process.

538
00:30:10,850 --> 00:30:12,727
[Victoria] You... You okay with everything?

539
00:30:12,811 --> 00:30:13,811
Yeah.

540
00:30:15,188 --> 00:30:17,524
Hi! I'm Sadie Mangelsdorf.

541
00:30:17,607 --> 00:30:19,275
I live in Tennessee.

542
00:30:19,359 --> 00:30:21,861
My Chinese name is Chun Hua Feng.

543
00:30:21,945 --> 00:30:24,823
Uh, I'm hoping to learn more
about my birth family,

544
00:30:24,906 --> 00:30:26,407
and I know this can be difficult,

545
00:30:26,491 --> 00:30:29,410
but I'm hoping to figure out
the story from all sides.

546
00:30:29,494 --> 00:30:31,496
[hopeful music playing]

547
00:30:39,796 --> 00:30:45,343
[Liu] <i>I'm heading to Tangwei Village
to meet Sadie's potential birth family.</i>

548
00:30:46,594 --> 00:30:49,097
<i>This is my favorite part of my job.</i>

549
00:30:49,973 --> 00:30:53,601
<i>I love to go to the village
and talk to the local people.</i>

550
00:30:55,603 --> 00:31:01,317
<i>Sometimes, they open their hearts to me,
and you will have this connection.</i>

551
00:31:02,652 --> 00:31:04,779
<i>I love to see that this can happen.</i>

552
00:31:06,990 --> 00:31:09,534
[woman speaking Cantonese]
We grow red peppers here.

553
00:31:10,076 --> 00:31:14,205
I've been farming since I was a teenager.

554
00:31:14,289 --> 00:31:16,291
- [Liu] Who taught you?
- My mom.

555
00:31:16,374 --> 00:31:17,834
[Liu continues speaking Cantonese]

556
00:31:17,917 --> 00:31:19,002
Ah!

557
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:21,671
[dog barking]

558
00:31:21,754 --> 00:31:23,214
[Huang Li] Our place is messy.

559
00:31:23,298 --> 00:31:24,424
[indistinct chatter]

560
00:31:24,507 --> 00:31:26,175
[Liu] What's this right here?

561
00:31:27,010 --> 00:31:30,471
That? When the one-child policy
was strict back in the days,

562
00:31:30,555 --> 00:31:32,265
we were told to get these things.

563
00:31:32,348 --> 00:31:36,436
Oh! It's the document for birth control!

564
00:31:37,395 --> 00:31:39,155
[Huang Li]
After I gave birth to my daughter,

565
00:31:39,230 --> 00:31:40,398
I went back to work.

566
00:31:40,481 --> 00:31:43,693
They would make me get "coil checks."

567
00:31:43,776 --> 00:31:45,320
- [Liu] IUD?
- [Huang Li] Right.

568
00:31:45,403 --> 00:31:48,197
They required you
to be examined every three months.

569
00:31:48,281 --> 00:31:50,658
It was really strict back then,
not like now.

570
00:31:53,494 --> 00:31:59,125
[Liu] Have you ever thought about the life
of the daughter you gave away?

571
00:31:59,208 --> 00:32:03,963
Whether she is living a good life?

572
00:32:04,964 --> 00:32:08,927
Yeah. How can I not think about that?

573
00:32:09,969 --> 00:32:12,639
So it was your second child
who was sent away.

574
00:32:13,473 --> 00:32:16,225
- [man] It was late in the night.
- [Huang Li] At midnight.

575
00:32:16,726 --> 00:32:19,062
Someone took the baby away.

576
00:32:19,145 --> 00:32:20,229
[Liu] Who was it?

577
00:32:21,272 --> 00:32:23,149
We asked a neighbor.

578
00:32:23,942 --> 00:32:26,444
He said he would find
someone to adopt her.

579
00:32:26,986 --> 00:32:29,405
We wrapped her in a small blanket.

580
00:32:30,865 --> 00:32:32,700
[Liu] Did you talk to him after that?

581
00:32:33,493 --> 00:32:36,037
He wouldn't tell us
who he gave the baby to.

582
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:38,790
He was afraid we'd want her back.

583
00:32:44,170 --> 00:32:47,173
[sobbing quietly]

584
00:33:02,271 --> 00:33:05,942
[Liu] I know it must be
a painful history for you.

585
00:33:06,025 --> 00:33:07,193
It's not easy.

586
00:33:13,658 --> 00:33:15,743
Right. That's the tube.

587
00:33:16,577 --> 00:33:19,872
There's a black line to indicate
the amount of saliva necessary.

588
00:33:23,459 --> 00:33:24,544
Okay, that's good.

589
00:33:24,627 --> 00:33:28,131
We'll send you a report
even if the DNA doesn't match.

590
00:33:29,882 --> 00:33:31,676
[emotional music playing]

591
00:33:31,759 --> 00:33:34,929

00:33:38,182 --> 00:33:40,268
<i>I think you can understand a lot of things</i>

594
00:33:40,351 --> 00:33:43,521
<i>that you never know
you would understand before.</i>

595
00:33:46,315 --> 00:33:49,902
<i>They do love their kids,

<i>It's so sad.</i>

597
00:33:56,617 --> 00:33:59,495
[Victoria] Sadie!
Blow it out, put it in the sink.

598
00:33:59,579 --> 00:34:01,998
[Sadie] You put way too many candles
on this cake.

599
00:34:02,081 --> 00:34:03,081
[boy chuckles]

600
00:34:05,293 --> 00:34:06,377
Yay!

601
00:34:06,461 --> 00:34:07,295
All that smoke...

602
00:34:07,378 --> 00:34:09,172
[Sadie] How big a slice
do you want, Mommy?

603
00:34:09,255 --> 00:34:10,089
[Victoria] Small!

604
00:34:10,173 --> 00:34:11,716
This is really good.

605
00:34:11,799 --> 00:34:15,011
You like it? That was always
my favorite cake as a kid.

606
00:34:16,345 --> 00:34:19,199
- [Penelope] Or do you want some ice cream?
- [Victoria] Oh, my God. Sadie, really?

607
00:34:19,223 --> 00:34:21,893
I'm really hungry!
My stomach was grumbling.

608

609
00:34:25,313 --> 00:34:27,356
[Victoria] Okay, y'all, get your shoes on...

Come on, guys!

611
00:34:32,487 --> 00:34:35,073

They'll be right here.

- See ya. Bye.
- [Victoria] Bye.

- All right.
- [Sadie] Bye, Mommy.

- Bye. Love you.
- Love you. Happy birthday!

That's so cute.

[man] So we know what you're gonna
do when you get finished, right?

645
00:36:02,410 --> 00:36:04,120
[Sadie] I... I guess since the divorce,

646
00:36:04,203 --> 00:36:07,165
I'm just kind of used to
everything being separate.

647
00:36:08,124 --> 00:36:13,296
Like, separate birthdays,
separate Christmas, separate holidays.

648
00:36:14,589 --> 00:36:17,675
But honestly, I don't really remember

649
00:36:17,758 --> 00:36:21,846
a time when they were
ever happy together, so...

650
00:36:23,139 --> 00:36:27,310
I mean, I bet there was
probably one moment or so, but, yeah.

- [Sadie] I love you too.

I don't know what your struggles are.

00:37:18,152 --> 00:37:22,240
[Liu] We are on the Two Bridge
where Sadie was found.

661
00:37:24,909 --> 00:37:26,786
[in Cantonese] Hello, Auntie.

662
00:37:26,869 --> 00:37:30,539
Has anyone near here ever...

663
00:37:30,623 --> 00:37:32,959
- Found a baby?
- Yes, have you ever seen one?

664
00:37:33,042 --> 00:37:34,710
- No, I haven't.
- You haven't?

665
00:37:35,586 --> 00:37:37,546
[laughing] No, I only sell things here.

666
00:37:38,839 --> 00:37:43,052
[in English] They always put the baby
in a very bustling area

667
00:37:43,135 --> 00:37:45,972
that makes sure so many people pass by,

668
00:37:46,055 --> 00:37:47,598
and they can see the baby.

669
00:37:49,976 --> 00:37:52,436
I always knew about the one-child policy

670
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:54,897
'cause a lot of my relatives,

671
00:37:54,981 --> 00:37:58,484
they just... give up their children.

672
00:37:58,567 --> 00:37:59,567
Their girls.

673
00:38:00,278 --> 00:38:03,406
And my parents, they almost gave up me,

674
00:38:03,489 --> 00:38:05,992
because they don't want
to pay the penalty.

675
00:38:07,034 --> 00:38:11,289
But I'm very lucky
'cause my grandparents,

676
00:38:11,372 --> 00:38:13,833
they said, "No, we want to keep her."

677
00:38:14,542 --> 00:38:18,713
So I just don't have
a very good relationship with my father.

678
00:38:19,463 --> 00:38:20,798
I remember one time,

679
00:38:20,881 --> 00:38:25,386
my father wanted to take my brother
to a very fancy restaurant.

680
00:38:25,469 --> 00:38:27,763
You can get little cute dim sum here.

681
00:38:27,847 --> 00:38:30,766
And, you know, I really loved that one.

682
00:38:30,850 --> 00:38:33,561
And he just wanted
to take my brother there,

683
00:38:33,644 --> 00:38:37,148
and I asked him if I can go with them.

684
00:38:37,231 --> 00:38:40,276
And he just pushed me out of the elevator,

685
00:38:40,359 --> 00:38:41,861
said, "No, you can't go."

686
00:38:44,530 --> 00:38:48,576
It was very difficult for me
because you know you're not welcome.

687
00:38:49,327 --> 00:38:53,372
You are in the wrong gender,
they don't want you, and you know that.

688
00:38:55,166 --> 00:38:56,417
It's very hard.

689
00:38:59,128 --> 00:39:02,548
So that's why I feel
so connected with the girls.

690
00:39:04,258 --> 00:39:06,802
I... I cannot say
I totally understand them,

691
00:39:06,886 --> 00:39:09,347
but, you know, part of this, I...

692
00:39:09,430 --> 00:39:11,724
We kind of share same feelings, yeah.

693
00:39:34,205 --> 00:39:35,205
[man] Hey, there.

694
00:39:35,706 --> 00:39:36,706
How are you?

695
00:39:37,208 --> 00:39:38,292
[Lilly] Thanks for coming.

696
00:39:41,837 --> 00:39:43,506
- Did I tell you about that?
- No.

697
00:39:44,006 --> 00:39:46,258
I'm talking to this girl from Beijing.

698
00:39:46,801 --> 00:39:49,720
And I think
she's trying to find my birth parents.

699
00:39:50,304 --> 00:39:52,807
And she's like,
"I'm gonna be honest with you,

700
00:39:52,890 --> 00:39:54,225
the chance is low."

701
00:39:56,685 --> 00:40:01,565
I think it's pretty exciting.
Hopefully they have some luck, you know?

702
00:40:01,649 --> 00:40:02,649
I want them to.

703
00:40:05,986 --> 00:40:07,780
So, tell me where your classes are.

704
00:40:07,863 --> 00:40:10,491
- Uh, Engineering North, right there.
- Oh, yeah. Yeah.

705
00:40:10,574 --> 00:40:13,369
I have one in there.
That's where my Accounting class is.

706
00:40:13,452 --> 00:40:16,252
- No, my Accounting class...
- I think that's where mine may have been.

707
00:40:16,288 --> 00:40:17,289
- Really?
- Yeah.

708
00:40:17,957 --> 00:40:20,668
I can take you
to a tailgate if you want to.

709
00:40:20,751 --> 00:40:22,294
[Mike] Whatever you wanna do.

710
00:40:25,005 --> 00:40:28,717
When Lily asked me
to come up here for the Dad's Weekend,

711
00:40:28,801 --> 00:40:30,886
of course I was over...

712
00:40:30,970 --> 00:40:33,431
You know, just happy to... to do that.

713
00:40:34,682 --> 00:40:37,810
You know, growing up, all of her friends
thought I was her dad.

714
00:40:37,893 --> 00:40:39,520
So she would call me "Dad."

715
00:40:39,603 --> 00:40:42,022
And sometimes, she said,
"I would not even...

716
00:40:42,106 --> 00:40:43,399
I wouldn't even correct 'em,

717
00:40:43,482 --> 00:40:45,568
because it was...
What's the point, you know?"

718
00:40:45,651 --> 00:40:48,779
"I want a dad, so he can be my dad."

719
00:40:48,863 --> 00:40:50,030
[chuckling]

720
00:40:51,824 --> 00:40:54,618
[Deborah] I remember
when Lily was really little,

721
00:40:54,702 --> 00:40:57,079
she would talk about,
you know, finding her family,

722
00:40:57,163 --> 00:41:01,625
and she used to write letters
to her father when she was, like, three.

723
00:41:02,418 --> 00:41:05,004
She would go and put them in the mailbox.

724
00:41:05,087 --> 00:41:08,257
And then, she had
a really, really hard time

725
00:41:08,340 --> 00:41:10,009
when she was a junior in high school.

726
00:41:11,427 --> 00:41:16,724
[Lily] I knew I needed help
because I would just cry all the time.

727
00:41:18,434 --> 00:41:21,687
Like, I... like, if I was just in class,
like, I'd be sad.

728
00:41:21,770 --> 00:41:24,899
Like, I, literally, on the weekends
would wake up and start crying.

729
00:41:26,233 --> 00:41:28,360
But I think the hardest thing was, like,

730
00:41:28,444 --> 00:41:31,030
I could talk about it
all day with friends,

731
00:41:31,113 --> 00:41:33,491
but it's like,
they like, wouldn't understand.

732
00:41:38,537 --> 00:41:42,249
[man speaking Cantonese]
A neighbor saw the ad. He saw the photo.

733
00:41:43,584 --> 00:41:46,712
He told me, "That girl
looks like your daughter a lot."

734
00:41:51,759 --> 00:41:54,345
[Liu] How long have you been living here?

735
00:41:55,137 --> 00:41:56,222
- Me?
- [Liu] Right.

736
00:41:58,265 --> 00:42:00,059
I've been living here since I was born.

737
00:42:01,727 --> 00:42:03,270
I work in the rice fields.

738
00:42:08,359 --> 00:42:13,197
[Liu] So, did you make the decision
to give up the baby

739
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:16,784
before she was born or after?

740
00:42:17,368 --> 00:42:22,748
I decided after she was born.
Because the village officials found out.

741
00:42:24,208 --> 00:42:28,504
If we kept her,
it was going to cost us at least $8,500.

742
00:42:29,463 --> 00:42:33,008
We were forced by the circumstances.
We had no choice at all.

743
00:42:35,803 --> 00:42:39,557
I left her at the People's Hospital,
next to the main entrance.

744
00:42:42,184 --> 00:42:46,021
It was four or five o'clock
in the morning.

745
00:42:47,898 --> 00:42:52,152
Because it would have been too cold
to leave her there overnight.

746
00:42:53,696 --> 00:42:56,115
I left a note with her date of birth.

747
00:42:57,783 --> 00:42:59,952
I left 300 RMB in her clothes.

748
00:43:01,412 --> 00:43:04,206
Nothing else.
Just the money in her clothes.

749
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:07,835
That's what happened.

750
00:43:14,091 --> 00:43:15,467
Of course I felt awful.

751
00:43:15,551 --> 00:43:18,095
My own child
would be taken by someone else.

752
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:23,892
Doesn't matter if it's a boy or a girl,
it's my own child.

753
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:36,905
[Liu] Did your wife know
that you were giving up the baby?

754
00:43:37,990 --> 00:43:39,575
She knew what I was doing.

755
00:43:41,285 --> 00:43:43,370
She was crying.

756
00:43:44,163 --> 00:43:45,414
She couldn't bear it.

757
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:53,922
She wanted me to get the baby back.
I said I didn't know who took her.

758
00:43:57,468 --> 00:43:59,470
[skillet sizzling]

759
00:44:02,056 --> 00:44:04,391
[girl] Mom, cut up the onion for me.

760
00:44:06,226 --> 00:44:07,478
Just that.

761
00:44:07,561 --> 00:44:09,063
Cut it in slices.

762
00:44:18,447 --> 00:44:20,157
[Liu] Who taught you to cook?

763
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:23,410
[Chen Chunjiao] I've taught myself
since I was very little.

764
00:44:24,286 --> 00:44:27,331
You know, my mom doesn't cook.

765
00:44:27,414 --> 00:44:28,457
[laughing]

766
00:44:29,083 --> 00:44:32,169
I can only ask her
to help with simple tasks.

767
00:44:34,546 --> 00:44:38,092
[Liu] Do you work in the fields?

768
00:44:38,175 --> 00:44:42,805
I used to. But not anymore.

769
00:44:42,888 --> 00:44:45,099
- [pan sizzling]
- [chuckling]

770
00:44:45,182 --> 00:44:51,146
I couldn't manage it. It's a tough job.

771
00:44:52,606 --> 00:44:56,819
[Liu] So, when did you find out
you had a little sister?

772
00:44:57,319 --> 00:45:01,115
[Chen Chunjiao] When I was
in the fourth or fifth grade, I think.

773
00:45:01,782 --> 00:45:07,079
My mom, sometimes
she would talk to other people

774
00:45:07,162 --> 00:45:12,751
about babies who got adopted.

775
00:45:14,670 --> 00:45:17,256
She would ask around.

776
00:45:18,173 --> 00:45:21,427
She talks about it less often now.

777
00:45:22,928 --> 00:45:29,059
Uh, I had the chance to grow up
with my parents around.

778
00:45:29,143 --> 00:45:31,311
I feel lucky.

779
00:45:31,395 --> 00:45:37,401
But she didn't have
the same opportunity like I did.

780
00:45:37,484 --> 00:45:38,694
I feel guilty.

781
00:45:39,862 --> 00:45:43,615
It was my parents who made the decision.

782
00:45:44,992 --> 00:45:49,121
But we are sisters, after all.

783
00:45:53,959 --> 00:45:55,961
[phone ringing]

784
00:45:56,712 --> 00:45:58,505
- [Lily in English] <i>Hi.</i>
- [Liu] Good evening.

785
00:45:58,589 --> 00:46:01,300
<i>- How are you?</i>
- [Liu] Yeah, I'm great.

786
00:46:01,383 --> 00:46:03,761
We found something very interesting.

787
00:46:03,844 --> 00:46:05,220
<i>A man called to me.</i>

788
00:46:05,304 --> 00:46:08,807
<i>His home is very close
to Lily's finding place.</i>

789
00:46:08,891 --> 00:46:11,560
<i>It's just, like, ten minutes to get there.</i>

790
00:46:12,227 --> 00:46:16,106
This man's name is, uh, Chen Muxing.

791
00:46:16,190 --> 00:46:22,070
He had six children total, uh,
three sons and three daughters.

792
00:46:22,154 --> 00:46:25,365
I talked to this man's daughter,

793
00:46:25,449 --> 00:46:27,659
<i>and she looks like you.</i>

794
00:46:27,743 --> 00:46:33,081
<i>So I think it is possible that they
could be your biological parents.</i>

795
00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:37,753
Want to see some pictures
of that guy and his family?

796
00:46:41,840 --> 00:46:43,091
[Lily groans hesitantly]

797
00:46:44,510 --> 00:46:45,511
Do I want to?

798
00:46:46,428 --> 00:46:47,763
It's your call, honey.

799
00:46:49,807 --> 00:46:50,933
Why are you crying?

800
00:46:55,813 --> 00:46:57,856
[groaning] I don't know.

801
00:47:04,571 --> 00:47:06,573
[shuddering]

802
00:47:07,825 --> 00:47:10,035
- [sobbing]
- [Liu] <i>It's okay. Don't worry.</i>

803
00:47:21,588 --> 00:47:24,258
[Deborah] We've talked about this
since you were a baby.

804
00:47:24,967 --> 00:47:27,219
They were very poor,

805
00:47:28,303 --> 00:47:30,514
and they didn't really have a choice.

806
00:47:31,306 --> 00:47:33,642
And it wasn't that they didn't love you

807
00:47:34,810 --> 00:47:36,144
or care about you.

808
00:47:37,771 --> 00:47:38,814
[Lily] Maybe next time.

809
00:47:40,065 --> 00:47:41,065
Okay.

810
00:47:45,988 --> 00:47:48,240
[Deborah] <i>The whole process of adoption,</i>

811
00:47:49,408 --> 00:47:50,408
<i>it's grieving.</i>

812
00:47:52,744 --> 00:47:56,832
<i>They have to come to a point
where they can grieve what they've lost.</i>

813
00:48:00,586 --> 00:48:02,087
[priest] <i>Hear us, O Lord, we pray.</i>

814
00:48:02,170 --> 00:48:04,548
For we offer these prayers
in the name of Jesus,

815
00:48:04,631 --> 00:48:07,217
the Lord of all things,
on this Easter day,

816
00:48:07,301 --> 00:48:09,219
when we celebrate the empty tomb

817
00:48:09,303 --> 00:48:12,556
and the gift of new life
in Him who has conquered death.

818
00:48:13,348 --> 00:48:16,894
Heavenly Father,
thank you for the gift of your son.

819
00:48:16,977 --> 00:48:19,021
Thank you for Easter.

820
00:48:21,148 --> 00:48:24,318
Lord, thank you
for having my family here with me today,

821
00:48:24,401 --> 00:48:26,445
and bless this food we are about to eat.

822
00:48:28,488 --> 00:48:29,990
[Sari] Moses had two mothers,

823
00:48:30,073 --> 00:48:32,451
his birth mother and his adoptive one.

824
00:48:33,660 --> 00:48:36,914
And so my daughter's other mother,
I thank you.

825
00:48:36,997 --> 00:48:38,707
We will never know each other,

826
00:48:38,790 --> 00:48:42,711
but we needed each other to create
and love and nurture this child.

827
00:48:50,344 --> 00:48:53,430
[Liu speaking Cantonese]
So, let me ask you,

828
00:48:53,513 --> 00:48:56,308
where did you see the ad?

829
00:48:56,391 --> 00:48:59,603
[woman speaking Cantonese]
<i>I saw it on my husband's phone.</i>

830
00:49:01,104 --> 00:49:04,566
<i>I gave up a daughter in 2001.</i>

831
00:49:04,650 --> 00:49:08,028
<i>We sent another one away in 2003.</i>

832
00:49:09,154 --> 00:49:12,199
[Liu]
Do you remember if she had any birthmarks?

833
00:49:12,699 --> 00:49:14,284
<i>I didn't pay attention.</i>

834
00:49:14,368 --> 00:49:19,539
<i>I only looked at her face,
which had no marks on it.</i>

835
00:49:20,040 --> 00:49:24,252
[Liu in English] I think she could be
Sadie's mother, but I'm not sure.

836
00:49:24,336 --> 00:49:27,547
She owns a clothes shop in Yangchung

837
00:49:27,631 --> 00:49:31,760
and told me she gave up three daughters.

838
00:49:32,469 --> 00:49:34,888
That's quite a lot.

839
00:49:39,351 --> 00:49:42,396
[speaking Cantonese] Hello.
My name is Liu Hao. Nice to meet you.

840
00:49:42,980 --> 00:49:45,732
[shopkeeper] I don't want to be filmed.

841
00:49:45,816 --> 00:49:48,360
[Liu] We won't film you.

842
00:49:48,443 --> 00:49:51,613
If you sit behind that,
they won't be able to see you.

843
00:49:53,865 --> 00:49:55,575
[shopkeeper] I knew it was a girl.

844
00:49:55,659 --> 00:50:00,372
I couldn't bear to have another abortion,
so I gave birth to the baby instead.

845
00:50:02,207 --> 00:50:03,792
[Liu] You had the baby in a hospital?

846
00:50:03,875 --> 00:50:07,045
[shopkeeper] Right. I knew a doctor there.

847
00:50:07,129 --> 00:50:10,590
He told me to wait
until I was about to give birth,

848
00:50:10,674 --> 00:50:13,135
and then he would help me deliver.

849
00:50:13,802 --> 00:50:17,639
Because if you went
to the hospital too early,

850
00:50:17,723 --> 00:50:21,518
the doctors would find out
you were having an extra child.

851
00:50:22,436 --> 00:50:27,482
When they took my daughter away,
I fainted and fell to the floor.

852
00:50:29,651 --> 00:50:32,279
I have no idea where she ended up.

853
00:50:33,572 --> 00:50:39,453
I know she wouldn't understand
or forgive me if I found her.

854
00:50:39,536 --> 00:50:41,163
She wouldn't be nice to me.

855
00:50:42,414 --> 00:50:43,415
Let me ask you.

856
00:50:43,498 --> 00:50:45,751
Would you forgive me at all?

857
00:50:46,376 --> 00:50:48,962
[Liu] I ask myself this question.

858
00:50:50,005 --> 00:50:56,219
My dad, he and his mother
didn't want me when I was born.

859
00:50:56,303 --> 00:50:57,303
[shopkeeper] Mm-hmm.

860
00:50:58,055 --> 00:51:01,349
If she wants to forgive me,
she will. If not, let it be.

861
00:51:06,271 --> 00:51:08,607
[Liu in English] When I heard
what she has been through,

862
00:51:08,690 --> 00:51:10,358
I just felt like it's so painful.

863
00:51:10,442 --> 00:51:13,779
And I just...
I just feel so sorry about her.

864
00:51:17,032 --> 00:51:19,951
I just feel like
she's just like my mom, you know?

865
00:51:25,624 --> 00:51:28,460
It is what my mom
had been through, you know?

866
00:51:30,128 --> 00:51:33,590
My father wanted to leave her
because I'm not a boy.

867
00:51:44,601 --> 00:51:46,603
[indistinct chatter]

868
00:51:52,692 --> 00:51:53,735
[scooter honks]

869
00:51:56,488 --> 00:52:01,368
[Liu] <i>I just went back to Huazhou,
which was, uh, Chloe was born.</i>

870
00:52:02,035 --> 00:52:04,704
Yeah, and I went to her finding place.

871
00:52:04,788 --> 00:52:06,790
<i>Yeah, she was found on the street.</i>

872
00:52:06,873 --> 00:52:11,419
<i>It's a very busy street.
It was called Mingyue Road.</i>

873
00:52:12,295 --> 00:52:13,797
And I seem to remember

874
00:52:13,880 --> 00:52:18,009
that, um, this was not an uncommon place
for people to leave their babies.

875
00:52:18,093 --> 00:52:18,927
Is that true?

876
00:52:19,010 --> 00:52:20,762
I think it's pretty common

877
00:52:20,846 --> 00:52:24,224
because, you know, people always
left their babies in the, you know,

878
00:52:24,307 --> 00:52:27,936
bustling area that they hope
other will see that baby.

879
00:52:28,645 --> 00:52:29,688
- Wow.
- Wow.

880
00:52:30,438 --> 00:52:32,607
- That's where I was left?
- That's the street.

881
00:52:32,691 --> 00:52:35,193
That's so cool.
It's not cool, but it's pretty awesome.

882
00:52:35,277 --> 00:52:37,404
It's way more urban than I thought.

883
00:52:37,487 --> 00:52:40,824
It was my first excursion
out of the house.

884
00:52:40,907 --> 00:52:43,451
The very first place I ever was.

885
00:52:44,327 --> 00:52:46,913
Where do you think I was left?
There, there, there, or there?

886
00:52:46,997 --> 00:52:48,123
[Sari] I don't know.

887
00:52:49,749 --> 00:52:51,751
[line ringing]

888
00:52:52,544 --> 00:52:54,171
[Liu speaking Cantonese] Hello!

889
00:52:54,254 --> 00:52:59,676
You said you know Sadie's nanny?

890
00:53:00,468 --> 00:53:02,262
[man on phone] <i>Oh, right.</i>

891
00:53:02,345 --> 00:53:03,930
<i>I saw her picture online.</i>

892
00:53:04,014 --> 00:53:06,266
<i>I'm a friend of the nanny.</i>

893
00:53:06,349 --> 00:53:07,976
[Liu] That is awesome.

894
00:53:08,059 --> 00:53:11,354
[man] <i>She has worked
in the orphanage for over 20 years.</i>

895
00:53:11,438 --> 00:53:12,731
[Liu grunts in agreement]

896
00:53:12,814 --> 00:53:17,152
Do you mind giving me her number
so I can contact her?

897
00:53:19,070 --> 00:53:20,614
[in English] People never talk about

898
00:53:20,697 --> 00:53:24,284
these women
who took care of thousands of babies.

899
00:53:25,076 --> 00:53:28,955
I feel like they are the front, like,
warriors, you know, in the orphanage,

900
00:53:29,039 --> 00:53:32,709
because they are the one
who take the heavy jobs,

901
00:53:32,792 --> 00:53:34,836
to... to take care of the baby.

902
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:36,755
[baby fussing]

903
00:53:37,380 --> 00:53:40,634
[Victoria] When we were there in China,
we met Sadie's aunties.

904
00:53:41,134 --> 00:53:43,220
[indistinct chatter]

905
00:53:43,303 --> 00:53:45,972
We chartered a van
and went out to her orphanage.

906
00:53:47,098 --> 00:53:50,185
It was just row after row,
room after room of babies.

907
00:53:51,853 --> 00:53:54,064
There were about 20 babies per room,

908
00:53:54,147 --> 00:53:56,233
and one auntie per room.

909
00:53:56,316 --> 00:53:59,361
And apparently, they'd fill the bottles up
and just go down the row.

910
00:53:59,444 --> 00:54:02,405
As much as you could suck out
as fast as you can was what you got.

911
00:54:05,533 --> 00:54:08,411
Sadie had marks on her ankles and wrists.

912
00:54:08,495 --> 00:54:12,290
And I was kind of angry about that.
Like, who would do that?

913
00:54:12,374 --> 00:54:16,211
And I found out that at that time,
they didn't heat and cool the orphanages.

914
00:54:16,294 --> 00:54:20,090
So they would tie down their wrists
and put the blankets over them at night,

915
00:54:20,173 --> 00:54:21,591
so they would stay warm.

916
00:54:22,175 --> 00:54:24,552
Because there were
so many babies and so few aunties,

917
00:54:24,636 --> 00:54:26,554
they were just doing the best they could.

918
00:54:27,639 --> 00:54:30,141
And so I think
that was a little humbling to me,

919
00:54:30,225 --> 00:54:34,020
to realize how hard they were working
with how little they had.

920
00:54:34,938 --> 00:54:38,275
I wonder how, like, close
they were able to get to each baby,

921
00:54:38,358 --> 00:54:40,360
'cause there's, like, so many babies.

922
00:54:40,443 --> 00:54:43,822
I probably just want to know
how they were, like, feeling,

923
00:54:43,905 --> 00:54:47,409
like, watching all these kids,
like, knowing... You know?

924
00:54:47,492 --> 00:54:50,704
Yeah, like, was it, like,
super, like, meaningful with each baby,

925
00:54:50,787 --> 00:54:53,623
or did they, like, know
not to get super attached?

926
00:54:54,916 --> 00:54:56,626
And like, I don't understand.

927
00:54:56,710 --> 00:54:58,378
How are they gonna know you.

928
00:54:58,461 --> 00:55:00,588
- [Lily] Yeah.
- Or remember who we are?

929
00:55:08,888 --> 00:55:11,016
[Liu in Cantonese] Do you remember her?

930
00:55:11,099 --> 00:55:13,977
[woman 2 in Cantonese]
Yes, I took care of her.

931
00:55:14,477 --> 00:55:16,688
[Liu] This is what she looks like now.

932
00:55:16,771 --> 00:55:18,356
Is she a good height?

933
00:55:18,440 --> 00:55:21,151
- Yes. She's tall.
- I knew, just by looking at her picture.

934
00:55:21,234 --> 00:55:23,611
[chatter continues in Cantonese]

935
00:55:23,695 --> 00:55:28,533
She has long hair,
like many foreign girls.

936
00:55:28,616 --> 00:55:31,453
[Liu] Right. Long hair.

937
00:55:33,330 --> 00:55:38,084
When you were a kid, did you think
about what you wanted to do in the future?

938
00:55:38,168 --> 00:55:39,336
[Li] Not really.

939
00:55:39,419 --> 00:55:42,505
[chuckles] People from the countryside
don't have dreams.

940
00:55:42,589 --> 00:55:44,883
I can't write.

941
00:55:44,966 --> 00:55:49,346
I quit school in the second grade.

942
00:55:49,429 --> 00:55:50,597
[Liu] Why did you stop?

943
00:55:51,431 --> 00:55:54,142
We were poor with so many kids.

944
00:55:54,225 --> 00:55:55,310
No money to study.

945
00:55:56,269 --> 00:56:02,025
Life is much better now.
We even throw the leftovers away.

946
00:56:02,108 --> 00:56:03,610
[both laughing]

947
00:56:03,693 --> 00:56:05,528
[Liu] So, you remember her.

948
00:56:06,237 --> 00:56:08,031
[Li] Yeah, I remember many of them.

949
00:56:08,573 --> 00:56:12,452
She was skinny when she first came.

950
00:56:13,119 --> 00:56:15,580
It was a freezing day.

951
00:56:16,581 --> 00:56:21,711
A passerby found her on the sidewalk

952
00:56:21,795 --> 00:56:25,048
and brought her to us.

953
00:56:25,882 --> 00:56:31,012
I fed her gently in my arms,
as if she was my own.

954
00:56:31,721 --> 00:56:34,974
I brought her up and had to send her away.

955
00:56:35,809 --> 00:56:37,769
[emotional music playing]

956
00:56:40,563 --> 00:56:43,024
We nannies, we aren't cold-hearted.

957
00:56:43,108 --> 00:56:48,530
My heart aches
whenever I send a child away.

958
00:56:50,698 --> 00:56:56,746
They'd be sent so far away.
I'd think, "What's to become of them?"

959
00:57:21,604 --> 00:57:23,982
[Liu in English]
<i>The DNA results just came in.</i>

960
00:57:24,941 --> 00:57:27,735
<i>Unfortunately, nobody match.</i>

961
00:57:30,071 --> 00:57:31,823
<i>I knew it was a long shot.</i>

962
00:57:32,449 --> 00:57:34,617
<i>I still feel very disappointed.</i>

963
00:57:37,579 --> 00:57:42,208
According to the DNA reports,
the woman is not your biological mother.

964
00:57:42,292 --> 00:57:47,464
Uh, I believe someday, you know,
you... you guys probably can find them.

965
00:57:48,047 --> 00:57:49,966
- [Deborah]<i> Yes, I think so too.</i>
- Yeah.

966
00:57:50,049 --> 00:57:53,511
<i>These parents, they wanna know
what happened to their kids.</i>

967
00:57:55,096 --> 00:57:58,266
The woman who owns the, uh, clothing shop.

968
00:57:58,349 --> 00:58:00,768
- And, uh...
<i>- Yes, the barber?</i>

969
00:58:00,852 --> 00:58:03,605
Yeah. According to the DNA company,

970
00:58:03,688 --> 00:58:09,027
uh, this woman
is not your biological mother.

971
00:58:10,487 --> 00:58:17,202
It's a pity that I can't...
I can't make it now, you know?

972
00:58:17,285 --> 00:58:18,953
But I will keep looking,

973
00:58:19,037 --> 00:58:25,210
you know, keep doing research,
eh, to find your birth parents.

974
00:58:34,302 --> 00:58:37,722
I used to watch this show
called <i>Fresh Off The Boat</i>.

975
00:58:37,805 --> 00:58:42,268
And so I just kind of, like, imagined
my parents just sort of looking like them.

976
00:58:44,812 --> 00:58:49,901
Sometimes, I play out scenarios
in my head, like a big dramatic scene.

977
00:58:51,277 --> 00:58:53,613
I know I do that a lot.

978
00:58:53,696 --> 00:58:55,198
And I've done it a few times,

979
00:58:55,281 --> 00:58:59,035
I guess, thinking about
meeting my parents from China.

980
00:59:01,955 --> 00:59:04,958
I mean, it would be nice
if they did show up.

981
00:59:05,917 --> 00:59:09,212
Like, it's kind of like,
it would be nice to win the lottery,

982
00:59:09,295 --> 00:59:13,967
but, uh... like,
it's probably not gonna happen.

983
00:59:18,012 --> 00:59:20,014
[chickens clucking]

984
00:59:27,355 --> 00:59:31,901
[Liu] <i>I'm heading to the couple
who I thought could be Sadie's parents.</i>

985
00:59:33,152 --> 00:59:34,571
[Liu speaking Cantonese] Hello?

986
00:59:34,654 --> 00:59:37,323
Good morning! Did you have breakfast?

987
00:59:38,950 --> 00:59:42,537
[Liu in English] <i>I think it's important
I tell the family in person.</i>

988
00:59:43,871 --> 00:59:46,666
[Liu speaking Cantonese]
Hi! Nice to see you, Mr. Xu.

989
00:59:48,835 --> 00:59:51,296
[Liu continues in Cantonese, chuckles]

990
00:59:52,171 --> 00:59:54,591
When was the last time I was here?

991
00:59:55,300 --> 00:59:56,217
In October.

992
00:59:56,301 --> 00:59:58,052
[chatter continues in Cantonese]

993
00:59:58,136 --> 01:00:03,725
[Liu] I'm here to show you
the test results. It's here.

994
01:00:03,808 --> 01:00:06,728
It shows that your DNA

995
01:00:06,811 --> 01:00:11,899
doesn't match with the girl's.

996
01:00:12,400 --> 01:00:14,277
You can take a look.

997
01:00:18,364 --> 01:00:20,617
I won't give up looking for your daughter.

998
01:00:23,494 --> 01:00:27,332
Because your DNA is already at the lab,

999
01:00:27,415 --> 01:00:33,713
in the future,
if your daughter takes a test,

1000
01:00:33,796 --> 01:00:35,673
there will be a match.

1001
01:00:36,549 --> 01:00:40,428
It's okay. We're not giving up.

1002
01:00:47,810 --> 01:00:49,812
[Huang Li sobbing]

1003
01:00:57,487 --> 01:01:01,658
[Liu] I know it's hard for you, Auntie.

1004
01:01:01,741 --> 01:01:03,076
I'll keep searching.

1005
01:01:31,187 --> 01:01:32,814
[phone ringing]

1006
01:01:33,564 --> 01:01:36,484
- Hey, how are you?
<i>- [Sari] I'm good. How are you?</i>

1007
01:01:36,567 --> 01:01:39,612
[Victoria]
Doing pretty good. Are you ready for this?

1008
01:01:39,696 --> 01:01:43,408
- [Sari] Uh, you know, I... I think so.
- [chuckling]

1009
01:01:43,491 --> 01:01:45,576
<i>- </i>[laughing]<i> Maybe?</i>
- [Victoria chuckles]

1010
01:01:46,786 --> 01:01:50,123
[Sari] <i>I'm sure it's gonna
stir around a whole lot of stuff.</i>

1011
01:01:50,206 --> 01:01:51,666
Yeah, isn't it, though?

1012
01:01:52,750 --> 01:01:54,711
I leave a week from yesterday!

1013
01:01:55,670 --> 01:01:56,671
Oh, yeah, guess what?

1014
01:01:56,754 --> 01:01:59,674
I've decided I wanna get my nails done
before the China trip,

1015
01:01:59,757 --> 01:02:03,428
because I only get my nails done
before big events, so, yeah.

1016
01:02:03,511 --> 01:02:08,015
Oh! I learned how to say "Happy New Year"
in Chinese. It's "<i>Xīnnián kuàilè</i>."

1017
01:02:08,099 --> 01:02:10,893
- Wow.
- It's gonna be really fun.

1018
01:02:10,977 --> 01:02:13,855
I also think it's kind of funny,
'cause, like, we actually...

1019
01:02:13,938 --> 01:02:15,648
Like, we haven't met, really.

1020
01:02:15,732 --> 01:02:16,816
We know each other,

1021
01:02:16,899 --> 01:02:19,694
but like, also we're gonna be
meeting each other for the first time,

1022
01:02:19,777 --> 01:02:21,237
which is kind of weird.

1023
01:02:25,867 --> 01:02:27,702
[positive music playing]

1024
01:02:36,085 --> 01:02:38,212
[Chloe]
I don't know what room we are. Okay.

1025
01:02:41,299 --> 01:02:43,468
- Oh, my God, hello!
- Hi!

1026
01:02:44,135 --> 01:02:44,969
Oh, my God, sorry.

1027
01:02:45,052 --> 01:02:48,097
I was about to be
locked out of my hotel room, so...

1028
01:02:48,181 --> 01:02:50,516
- Where...
- There is no 2403.

1029
01:02:50,600 --> 01:02:52,477
- What about that way?
- Oh, yeah, there is.

1030
01:02:53,060 --> 01:02:54,312
Ding-dong!

1031
01:02:56,230 --> 01:02:58,316
- [Sadie] Oh, my God! Hello!
- Hello!

1032
01:02:58,399 --> 01:02:59,233
[girls chuckling]

1033
01:02:59,317 --> 01:03:00,377
- How are you?
- [Chloe] Hi!

1034
01:03:00,401 --> 01:03:01,652
I'm good.

1035
01:03:02,153 --> 01:03:03,696
- Yeah.
- [Chloe] How was your flight?

1036
01:03:03,780 --> 01:03:06,407
- [Lily] It was good.
- [Sadie] What time did you guys get in?

1037
01:03:06,491 --> 01:03:07,825
[Chloe] Like, 10:30?

1038
01:03:08,326 --> 01:03:11,370
- [Liu] Hi, Sadie!
- Hello! It's nice to meet you, finally.

1039
01:03:11,454 --> 01:03:13,664
Yeah. Finally meet in person.

1040
01:03:13,748 --> 01:03:14,665
[Sadie] I know!

1041
01:03:14,749 --> 01:03:17,126
[indistinct chatter]

1042
01:03:22,590 --> 01:03:24,509
[Sadie] What does starfruit taste like?

1043
01:03:25,176 --> 01:03:27,345
- [Lily] You just want to grab mine?
- Yeah.

1044
01:03:36,354 --> 01:03:39,774
- Oh, my gosh, is that it? That's crazy.
- Yeah, look, guys. There it is.

1045
01:03:39,857 --> 01:03:42,777
[Chloe singing]
<i>...shel Hanukkah</i>

1046
01:03:43,361 --> 01:03:48,658
To this, our first "Chrismanukah"
celebration with the cousins,

1047
01:03:48,741 --> 01:03:49,909
all together.

1048
01:03:49,992 --> 01:03:52,453
- [Victoria] Here, here!
- Okay, let's...

1049
01:03:52,537 --> 01:03:54,789
- [girls laughing]
- Lily!

1050
01:03:56,999 --> 01:03:58,918
[all laughing]

1051
01:04:01,379 --> 01:04:04,924
[singing] <i>♪ Crack an egg on your head
Let the yolk drip down ♪</i>

1052
01:04:05,007 --> 01:04:07,677
<i>♪ Crack an egg on your head
Let the yolk... ♪</i>

1053
01:04:07,760 --> 01:04:12,765
[all singing] <i>♪ Happy birthday to you! ♪</i>

1054
01:04:12,849 --> 01:04:14,267
[all cheering]

1055
01:04:14,350 --> 01:04:16,519
[Sadie] It's so many stairs!

1056
01:04:17,019 --> 01:04:18,019
[Chloe] I'll race you!

1057
01:04:19,730 --> 01:04:21,816
- [Sadie] So, how do we bow?
- Just like that.

1058
01:04:35,162 --> 01:04:38,708
I do not have a boyfriend.
I have a friend who's a boy.

1059
01:04:39,834 --> 01:04:41,669
I got friendzoned, so...

1060
01:04:41,752 --> 01:04:43,963
- [Chloe] Oh, <i>you</i> got friendzoned.
- [Sadie] Yeah.

1061
01:04:44,046 --> 01:04:47,884
He randomly came up to me
and was like, "Yo, let's just be friends."

1062
01:04:47,967 --> 01:04:49,760
And I was like, "Okay. That's okay."

1063
01:04:49,844 --> 01:04:52,555
- What about you, Lily?
- [Lily] Huh? No one.

1064
01:04:52,638 --> 01:04:53,723
Chloe?

1065
01:04:53,806 --> 01:04:55,683
[in Mandarin] I do not have a boyfriend.

1066
01:04:55,766 --> 01:04:57,935
- [laughing]
- [Sadie in English] What does that mean?

1067
01:04:58,060 --> 01:04:59,145
[Lily] What'd she say?

1068
01:04:59,270 --> 01:05:02,189
[Liu] She says,
"I don't have any boyfriend."

1069
01:05:03,566 --> 01:05:05,776
You were found on the Two Bridge.

1070
01:05:05,860 --> 01:05:07,820
Wait, where was I found, Huazhou?

1071
01:05:07,904 --> 01:05:08,904
[Liu] Huazhou.

1072
01:05:09,780 --> 01:05:11,616
- Where was she found?
- Wasn't I found in...

1073
01:05:11,699 --> 01:05:14,243
No, she was in the same orphanage, right?

1074
01:05:14,744 --> 01:05:16,370
Look at the cute clothes.

1075
01:05:16,454 --> 01:05:18,664
- Who's that? That's Chloe.
- That's me.

1076
01:05:18,748 --> 01:05:20,207
- [Liu] Yeah.
- [Lily] So cute.

1077
01:05:20,708 --> 01:05:24,086
Oh, my gosh, Chloe!
You literally look like James Charles!

1078
01:05:24,170 --> 01:05:26,172
[all laughing]

1079
01:05:26,255 --> 01:05:31,052
- [Lily] Wait, is that her commercial?
- [Sadie] Oh, no! What is that photo of me?

1080
01:05:31,135 --> 01:05:32,428
[Lily] That is so funny.

1081
01:05:32,511 --> 01:05:35,431
Yeah, seeing those photos,
I wouldn't want me back, either.

1082
01:05:35,514 --> 01:05:37,016
- Oh, my God!
- [girls chuckling]

1083
01:05:37,099 --> 01:05:38,935
Can you make a new commercial?

1084
01:05:39,018 --> 01:05:41,854
[all laughing]

1085
01:05:51,072 --> 01:05:52,698
[laughing]

1086
01:05:54,367 --> 01:05:56,035
[Sadie] Oh, my God!

1087
01:05:56,118 --> 01:05:59,038
- I love these. These look so soft.
- [Victoria] Pretty.

1088
01:05:59,121 --> 01:06:01,874
- [Lily] Is this mine?
- Have you seen... The Europe...

1089
01:06:01,958 --> 01:06:04,210
- Thank you!
- [Deborah] Those are nice!

1090
01:06:04,293 --> 01:06:06,295
- [Sadie] That's so cute!
- [Chloe] Oh, my God.

1091
01:06:07,380 --> 01:06:08,631
Oh, Lord.

1092
01:06:08,714 --> 01:06:12,134
- It's a big day for you guys today.
- [Victoria] Yes, it is a big day.

1093
01:06:12,218 --> 01:06:13,218
You ready?

1094
01:06:14,261 --> 01:06:15,930
I think so. I think so.

1095
01:06:16,013 --> 01:06:18,808
I know there's just gonna be so many
emotions today. It's, you know...

1096
01:06:18,891 --> 01:06:21,686
- [Sari] Sadie, how are you feeling?
- [Sadie] A little nervous.

1097
01:06:21,769 --> 01:06:28,401
I guess I just anticipate the meeting
of my nanny... of my nanny, so, yeah.

1098
01:06:28,484 --> 01:06:30,528
[whispering] Thank you.

1099
01:06:32,655 --> 01:06:35,157
To be here is a lot of emotions in itself.

1100
01:06:35,950 --> 01:06:40,579
Things are so different now than I thought
they were gonna be when I got Sadie.

1101
01:06:42,623 --> 01:06:46,460
About how... you're not the family
you thought you were gonna give her.

1102
01:06:47,795 --> 01:06:51,007
And then I worry that, you know, that
I still gave her the life I promised her.

1103
01:06:51,090 --> 01:06:54,176
You know, because I don't think
that mother, though she gave her up,

1104
01:06:54,260 --> 01:06:56,095
would want her in a split home.

1105
01:06:57,722 --> 01:06:58,722
You know?

1106
01:06:59,557 --> 01:07:03,227
I feel like that mother has to wonder,
where is she at? Is she happy?

1107
01:07:03,310 --> 01:07:06,188
What's she look like?
What does she like to eat?

1108
01:07:10,526 --> 01:07:12,069
[whispering] Okay. I'll be fine.

1109
01:07:13,154 --> 01:07:15,156
[indistinct chatter]

1110
01:07:33,799 --> 01:07:35,509
[Liu] Is it still the same?

1111
01:07:35,593 --> 01:07:39,513
- Do you... Which is the...
- It's... Yeah. Yes, it's very similar.

1112
01:07:39,597 --> 01:07:41,807
But Sadie was in the white building here.

1113
01:07:42,683 --> 01:07:44,935
The white building
was the original building.

1114
01:07:47,146 --> 01:07:48,647
[Liu] Oh, that's the nanny!

1115
01:07:49,398 --> 01:07:50,524
[Sadie] Hello!

1116
01:07:50,608 --> 01:07:52,234
- Nanny Li.
- This is you?

1117
01:07:52,318 --> 01:07:53,736
Nanny Li. Yeah, hang on.

1118
01:07:53,819 --> 01:07:56,155
[Li in Cantonese] That is me.
I didn't realize it at first.

1119
01:07:56,238 --> 01:08:00,534
[in English] She says, a long time ago,
but she saw the ads I post online,

1120
01:08:00,618 --> 01:08:04,914
and she saw this photo,
and she recognize, "It's me and it's you."

1121
01:08:04,997 --> 01:08:06,332
[Li chuckles]

1122
01:08:06,415 --> 01:08:08,459
[Liu] Yeah, she's holding you.

1123
01:08:08,542 --> 01:08:09,710
[Sadie] Oh!

1124
01:08:11,170 --> 01:08:12,850
[Li in Cantonese] First, I washed diapers.

1125
01:08:13,422 --> 01:08:19,595
Then I started taking care of the babies
from 2001 to 2005.

1126
01:08:19,678 --> 01:08:22,932
[Liu] When did Sadie
come to the orphanage?

1127
01:08:24,058 --> 01:08:27,770
In early December.

1128
01:08:29,021 --> 01:08:32,608
She wasn't wearing pretty clothes,
like the other babies.

1129
01:08:33,234 --> 01:08:36,695
She was no more than five pounds...

1130
01:08:36,779 --> 01:08:38,948
[Sadie in English]
<i>She knew all this stuff about me.</i>

1131
01:08:39,448 --> 01:08:41,408
<i>Yeah, she was a part of my life.</i>

1132
01:08:42,701 --> 01:08:45,412
<i>It feels like
a whole other past life, kind of.</i>

1133
01:08:46,413 --> 01:08:49,834
[Li in Cantonese]
Although she isn't my daughter,

1134
01:08:49,917 --> 01:08:51,961
I raised her until she was adopted.

1135
01:08:53,712 --> 01:08:54,713
You are so sweet.

1136
01:08:56,882 --> 01:08:59,093
It's a shame you can't find your mom.

1137
01:08:59,176 --> 01:09:01,178
[sniffling]

1138
01:09:03,681 --> 01:09:06,058
[Liu] Please keep an eye out for us.

1139
01:09:06,142 --> 01:09:08,352
Please tell us if anyone reaches out.

1140
01:09:12,940 --> 01:09:14,942
Sadie used to live here, right?

1141
01:09:15,442 --> 01:09:16,902
[Li] Yes, in this room.

1142
01:09:17,486 --> 01:09:21,240
[in English] The cribs went down,
around, and then in the middle.

1143
01:09:21,824 --> 01:09:25,661
How many kids in this room? You remember?
When you back there...

1144
01:09:25,744 --> 01:09:28,831
- In this room alone, at least 12. Yeah.
- At least 12?

1145
01:09:29,331 --> 01:09:31,417
[indistinct chatter]

1146
01:09:31,500 --> 01:09:32,751
[Sadie] Can I hold a baby?

1147
01:09:33,294 --> 01:09:34,753
- Okay.
- The head, Sadie.

1148
01:09:34,837 --> 01:09:37,298
Put the head higher.

1149
01:09:37,381 --> 01:09:40,426
You gotta hold it under the head.
There you go.

1150
01:09:44,346 --> 01:09:47,433
[Sadie] It doesn't feel real
that I came from here, honestly.

1151
01:09:48,726 --> 01:09:50,978
Everyone keeps telling me
it's my home place,

1152
01:09:51,061 --> 01:09:52,897
but, like, I don't remember it at all.

1153
01:09:54,440 --> 01:09:59,486
Yeah, I just... I can't believe, like,
I was one of those kids in there.

1154
01:10:01,447 --> 01:10:04,074
I feel like I'm kind of just, like,
walking through a movie,

1155
01:10:04,158 --> 01:10:06,994
but then I'm like,
"Wait, no, this is real life."

1156
01:10:08,287 --> 01:10:11,749
It's crazy to think
that, like, I was brought in this street,

1157
01:10:11,832 --> 01:10:16,253
and then brought back out, like...
16 years later, here we are.

1158
01:10:16,837 --> 01:10:17,963
[Liu] Bye-bye!

1159
01:10:18,047 --> 01:10:19,673
[Sadie] Bye!

1160
01:10:19,757 --> 01:10:25,554
Well, they told us that she was left
in a box, cardboard box.

1161
01:10:26,805 --> 01:10:28,891
I don't know if the bushes were here then.

1162
01:10:30,726 --> 01:10:33,604
Because we stood...
But it was right by this tree.

1163
01:10:34,980 --> 01:10:37,107
- Which one? This tree?
- [Victoria] That tree.

1164
01:10:37,191 --> 01:10:39,318
- Yeah.
- [Liu] That's where Sadie was found.

1165
01:10:39,401 --> 01:10:41,487
[Victoria] She was by this tree
in a cardboard box.

1166
01:10:43,155 --> 01:10:47,368
Whichever parent left it
probably was watching, waiting.

1167
01:10:47,451 --> 01:10:49,536
Just... You know what I mean? They...

1168
01:10:49,620 --> 01:10:52,831
'Cause you were found really early
in the morning, before 7:00.

1169
01:10:52,915 --> 01:10:53,958
Before it got too busy,

1170
01:10:54,041 --> 01:10:56,752
but they put you here
so when people started getting busy, that...

1171
01:10:57,419 --> 01:10:58,754
you'd be found right away.

1172
01:10:58,837 --> 01:11:02,258
So you wouldn't be cold, and all this...
I think you were wrapped in a coat.

1173
01:11:02,341 --> 01:11:04,760
- Yeah.
- In an adult raincoat or something.

1174
01:11:07,846 --> 01:11:11,558
[Sadie] It's a lot of stuff to see
all in one day.

1175
01:11:12,935 --> 01:11:14,687
When I was younger, in 4th grade,

1176
01:11:14,770 --> 01:11:19,608
I had a bottle where I would
write little notes of my feelings

1177
01:11:19,692 --> 01:11:21,610
and shove them into the bottle.

1178
01:11:21,694 --> 01:11:25,781
Until, I guess, one day,
when I'm ready to break it.

1179
01:11:27,283 --> 01:11:29,368
So, that's how I dealt with it.

1180
01:11:29,451 --> 01:11:33,455
I literally and figuratively
bottled up my emotions.

1181
01:11:35,416 --> 01:11:38,294
I don't know.
I just don't know how to deal with it now.

1182
01:12:05,195 --> 01:12:08,282
So, we are heading to Huazhou Orphanage,

1183
01:12:08,365 --> 01:12:12,036
which was where Lily and Chloe come from.

1184
01:12:12,119 --> 01:12:15,622
And we're gonna meet
Chloe's nanny in the orphanage.

1185
01:12:15,706 --> 01:12:19,251
She will show us
around that, um, that place.

1186
01:12:19,335 --> 01:12:20,335
[Sadie] Yeah.

1187
01:12:20,669 --> 01:12:23,047
[kids clamoring]

1188
01:12:34,266 --> 01:12:38,729
[speaking Cantonese] Thanks for bringing
so many gifts for the kids.

1189
01:12:41,023 --> 01:12:42,983
[Chloe in English] Li Lan is amazing.

1190
01:12:44,068 --> 01:12:48,739
She was my caregiver
for the first year-and-a-half of my life.

1191
01:12:48,822 --> 01:12:50,491
[Sari] Hi, baby.

1192
01:12:51,909 --> 01:12:54,286
[Chloe]
And she still works there to this day.

1193
01:12:54,370 --> 01:12:56,497
[Li Lan in Cantonese]
This is where the kids live.

1194
01:12:58,540 --> 01:12:59,792
Hello, everyone.

1195
01:12:59,875 --> 01:13:01,251
Say hi to your sisters.

1196
01:13:02,002 --> 01:13:05,589
[Chloe in English] She went
to medical school on the weekends,

1197
01:13:05,672 --> 01:13:09,051
and she was a nanny during the week.

1198
01:13:09,134 --> 01:13:11,845
And she's the director
of the orphanage now.

1199
01:13:11,929 --> 01:13:13,931
[making baby noises]

1200
01:13:16,433 --> 01:13:17,518
Nĭ hăo!

1201
01:13:18,811 --> 01:13:21,355
[Chloe] I was surprised
that Li Lan remembered me

1202
01:13:21,438 --> 01:13:25,067
because she did have to
take care of, like, so many babies,

1203
01:13:25,150 --> 01:13:27,861
and she's still taking care of babies,
and I just...

1204
01:13:27,945 --> 01:13:30,447
I don't know how you remember all of that.
[chuckling]

1205
01:13:31,949 --> 01:13:36,203
[speaking Cantonese] How many babies
did you take care of back then?

1206
01:13:37,121 --> 01:13:41,917
[speaking Cantonese] After 2001,
it was the peak time. Over 200 kids.

1207
01:13:42,418 --> 01:13:45,295
The conditions in the orphanage
weren't optimal.

1208
01:13:45,921 --> 01:13:49,675
We had only two nurses and no doctor.

1209
01:13:49,758 --> 01:13:51,427
There were many babies.

1210
01:13:51,510 --> 01:13:56,014
We weren't able to take them
to the hospital whenever they got sick.

1211
01:13:56,515 --> 01:13:59,560
There was no doctor,
so we couldn't use prescription drugs.

1212
01:13:59,643 --> 01:14:03,105
So I went to medical school in 2002.

1213
01:14:03,689 --> 01:14:05,691
[Chloe in English]
She gave me my vaccination.

1214
01:14:06,316 --> 01:14:11,238
[in Cantonese] I gave her this vaccine.
I did it for all the babies.

1215
01:14:11,321 --> 01:14:13,657
- Did I cry a lot?
- [Li Lan] No.

1216
01:14:13,740 --> 01:14:14,575
Really?

1217
01:14:14,658 --> 01:14:16,785
[in Cantonese]
She only cried when she was vaccinated.

1218
01:14:16,869 --> 01:14:18,203
She usually didn't cry.

1219
01:14:18,287 --> 01:14:20,956
She was outgoing and alive.

1220
01:14:21,457 --> 01:14:25,961
[Liu] When Chloe first came
to the orphanage, how old was she?

1221
01:14:26,044 --> 01:14:29,506
We think she was born that day.

1222
01:14:30,215 --> 01:14:32,968
[Liu] Who brought her to the orphanage?

1223
01:14:33,051 --> 01:14:35,762
[Li Lan] It would have been
the local police department.

1224
01:14:36,930 --> 01:14:38,807
[Sari in English]
Why are you crying, baby?

1225
01:14:39,766 --> 01:14:40,766
It's a lot.

1226
01:14:41,727 --> 01:14:43,520
You need me to give you a hug?

1227
01:14:43,604 --> 01:14:45,606
[emotional music playing]

1228
01:14:47,566 --> 01:14:51,153
[Chloe] She was, like, kind of the closest
thing I had to a mother at the time.

1229
01:14:51,236 --> 01:14:52,070
It was like...

1230
01:14:52,154 --> 01:14:53,864
[sniffling]

1231
01:14:53,947 --> 01:14:56,867
It's really nice to know
that she loved me, and, like...

1232
01:14:56,950 --> 01:14:58,785
like, was able to take care of me

1233
01:14:58,869 --> 01:15:01,580
out of, like, hundreds of babies
in the orphanage, so...

1234
01:15:01,663 --> 01:15:03,499
[continues sniffling]

1235
01:15:03,582 --> 01:15:06,126
I feel like it's just so big, and, like...

1236
01:15:07,336 --> 01:15:08,921
she took care of me,

1237
01:15:09,004 --> 01:15:13,383
and, like... I don't know
what it's like to, like... [sniffles]

1238
01:15:13,467 --> 01:15:14,843
[whispering] I don't know.

1239
01:15:17,846 --> 01:15:19,264
Is Lily in here?

1240
01:15:20,224 --> 01:15:22,893
[Lily] It's okay. It's okay, little one.

1241
01:15:26,104 --> 01:15:29,233
[Chloe] I'm happy we're going
through it with Sadie and Lily,

1242
01:15:29,316 --> 01:15:31,151
'cause, like, we all have each other.

1243
01:15:31,693 --> 01:15:33,612
I haven't known them for long,

1244
01:15:33,695 --> 01:15:36,406
but, like, there's just... I don't know.

1245
01:15:37,115 --> 01:15:40,994
Unconditional, like, thing. Like, you
just know they know what you feel.

1246
01:15:42,788 --> 01:15:45,249
Like, you don't even
have to explain it to them.

1247
01:15:45,749 --> 01:15:46,875
[Lily] It's okay.

1248
01:15:57,761 --> 01:15:58,595
There you go.

1249
01:15:58,679 --> 01:16:00,639
[both chuckling]

1250
01:16:26,248 --> 01:16:27,416
[Liu] Yang Mudi!

1251
01:16:28,250 --> 01:16:29,876
Her name is Yang Mudi.

1252
01:16:29,960 --> 01:16:31,420
- Yang Mudi?
- Yang Mudi.

1253
01:16:31,503 --> 01:16:32,421
Nanny Yang.

1254
01:16:32,504 --> 01:16:33,630
[both chuckle]

1255
01:16:34,965 --> 01:16:36,091
Hi!

1256
01:16:36,174 --> 01:16:37,974
[speaking Cantonese]
Hello, Auntie. [chuckles]

1257
01:16:38,635 --> 01:16:39,636
Nĭ hăo!

1258
01:16:40,345 --> 01:16:42,222
- [Liu] This is Lily.
- I recognize her.

1259
01:16:42,306 --> 01:16:44,349
- [Liu] You recognize her?
- [Yang Mudi] I do.

1260
01:16:45,058 --> 01:16:47,811
[Liu] This is her mother.
This is her mother.

1261
01:16:48,979 --> 01:16:52,649
[indistinct chatter]

1262
01:16:54,484 --> 01:16:57,279
[Liu] Can you tell us
how long Lily lived here?

1263
01:16:57,362 --> 01:16:59,823
[Yang] I brought her up
until she was adopted.

1264
01:17:00,657 --> 01:17:02,868
When there were
too many babies in the orphanage,

1265
01:17:02,951 --> 01:17:05,078
we'd raise them at home
until they're sent away.

1266
01:17:05,162 --> 01:17:07,914
[Liu] How many babies lived here?

1267
01:17:07,998 --> 01:17:12,127
[Yang] Sometimes more than 10,
sometimes just a few.

1268
01:17:14,212 --> 01:17:15,964
You were living in that room.

1269
01:17:16,673 --> 01:17:18,675
[in English]
She says you lived in that room.

1270
01:17:18,759 --> 01:17:20,844
- [Lily] This one?
- You stayed in that room.

1271
01:17:21,720 --> 01:17:23,430
[Yang in Cantonese] You were here.

1272
01:17:24,514 --> 01:17:28,560
She was a mischievous girl. A bit naughty.

1273
01:17:28,644 --> 01:17:33,440
My grandma used to

1274
01:17:33,523 --> 01:17:35,692
tickle her and call her a bun.

1275
01:17:35,776 --> 01:17:39,196
[in English]
Her grandma just making fun of you.

1276
01:17:39,279 --> 01:17:41,531
- Joking all the time with you.
- [laughing]

1277
01:17:41,615 --> 01:17:47,204
She say you have this big round face.
And your name is Mei-Bao, right?

1278
01:17:47,287 --> 01:17:51,458
But in Chinese, it sounds like<i> Miànbāo,</i>
which means "bread."

1279
01:17:51,541 --> 01:17:54,920
And she say, "Oh, that big bread,"
when you were crying.

1280
01:17:55,003 --> 01:17:56,922
So she... Her grandma would...

1281
01:17:57,005 --> 01:17:58,882
[chuckling]

1282
01:17:58,965 --> 01:18:03,095
What was it like
to say goodbye to Mei-Bao?

1283
01:18:04,680 --> 01:18:07,599
[Yang in Cantonese]
I was sad that she was crying.

1284
01:18:08,892 --> 01:18:12,396
When I put her in her mom's arms,
she cried a lot.

1285
01:18:12,479 --> 01:18:16,024
I raised her
and grew feelings for her.

1286
01:18:22,114 --> 01:18:25,409
[Liu] Lily and her mom got this for you.

1287
01:18:26,827 --> 01:18:27,994
Thank you so much.

1288
01:18:28,078 --> 01:18:30,747
[Liu] Auntie, please open it
and see what's in it.

1289
01:18:37,963 --> 01:18:39,423
[Yang] Can you help me with it?

1290
01:18:39,506 --> 01:18:41,787
- [Lily in English] Sorry.
- [in Cantonese] Lily? Can you?

1291
01:18:42,050 --> 01:18:45,387
[Deborah in English] It's something
of mine that was very special.

1292
01:18:46,221 --> 01:18:47,889
And I wanted you to have it.

1293
01:18:48,390 --> 01:18:50,809
[Liu] This gift means a lot to her.

1294
01:18:51,935 --> 01:18:53,979
I see. I will have it on all the time.

1295
01:18:54,062 --> 01:18:55,742
[Liu in English] She'll wear it every day.

1296
01:18:55,772 --> 01:18:58,900
[in Cantonese] Always. [chuckles]

1297
01:18:58,984 --> 01:19:02,320
[Deborah in English] I want to thank you
so much for taking such good care of her.

1298
01:19:02,988 --> 01:19:07,993
And for... giving... her to me,

1299
01:19:08,076 --> 01:19:10,537
because she is such a joy.

1300
01:19:11,580 --> 01:19:15,876
[in Cantonese] I'm grateful to her mom
for raising her to be an excellent girl.

1301
01:19:15,959 --> 01:19:18,003
[Liu] Mm.

1302
01:19:18,086 --> 01:19:20,964
[Liu in English] She also thanks you
that you take care...

1303
01:19:21,047 --> 01:19:23,300
You are taking care of her, and make...

1304
01:19:23,383 --> 01:19:27,095
She's such a good, good girl now.
And a big girl now.

1305
01:19:27,179 --> 01:19:29,639
[Lily] I just noticed
she had, like, tears in her eyes.

1306
01:19:29,723 --> 01:19:32,017
That's kind of when I got emotional.

1307
01:19:32,100 --> 01:19:34,936
Because it showed that she cared about me.

1308
01:19:35,020 --> 01:19:36,813
And, I mean, like, I know she does.

1309
01:19:37,397 --> 01:19:38,397
So...

1310
01:19:40,025 --> 01:19:41,485
[Liu] One, two, three.

1311
01:19:42,736 --> 01:19:45,530
[Lily] The first months of my life
were a mystery.

1312
01:19:46,323 --> 01:19:48,658
I think being here has helped a lot.

1313
01:19:50,494 --> 01:19:51,494
[Liu] Thank you.

1314
01:20:03,757 --> 01:20:06,468
[Liu] So, we are heading
to the Yangmei Township.

1315
01:20:07,803 --> 01:20:13,183
Your finding place is, um...
in a government building of that town.

1316
01:20:13,683 --> 01:20:16,645
So we'll go there first and walk around.

1317
01:20:16,728 --> 01:20:19,981
And then the family
that could be your birth family,

1318
01:20:20,065 --> 01:20:23,276
I will come over there
and tell them the... the results.

1319
01:20:23,360 --> 01:20:25,028
- That it doesn't match.
- Okay.

1320
01:20:25,529 --> 01:20:28,114
That family really wanted
to find their child,

1321
01:20:28,198 --> 01:20:30,909
and that sister, that girl I talked to,

1322
01:20:30,992 --> 01:20:34,412
she really wants to find her sister,

1323
01:20:34,913 --> 01:20:35,913
that girl.

1324
01:20:36,998 --> 01:20:39,084
Would you like to come with me?

1325
01:20:39,167 --> 01:20:43,046
You don't need to come
if you don't want to, but...

1326
01:20:44,756 --> 01:20:46,883
I don't know. That's a big question.

1327
01:20:48,051 --> 01:20:48,885
Yeah.

1328
01:20:48,969 --> 01:20:52,264
[Lily] I don't know.
I really don't. I don't know.

1329
01:20:53,890 --> 01:20:55,058
Here's what I'll say.

1330
01:20:55,141 --> 01:20:59,855
I think that this family will be
very grateful to have... meet all of us,

1331
01:20:59,938 --> 01:21:01,940
and especially you, because, like,

1332
01:21:02,023 --> 01:21:04,150
even though you're not
their biological daughter,

1333
01:21:04,234 --> 01:21:07,946
they'll feel connected to you
because all of our families

1334
01:21:08,029 --> 01:21:10,448
went through similar stories,

1335
01:21:10,532 --> 01:21:14,077
and um, like, pressures in society

1336
01:21:14,160 --> 01:21:16,496
to, like, have to give up their daughter,
and, like,

1337
01:21:16,580 --> 01:21:19,332
even though you're not
their daughter, it's... um...

1338
01:21:19,958 --> 01:21:25,922
it's still a connection with someone
who knows the other half of their story.

1339
01:21:26,673 --> 01:21:27,673
Yeah.

1340
01:21:30,552 --> 01:21:31,761
[Lily] I... I say we go.

1341
01:21:32,512 --> 01:21:34,890
But they're gonna
come with me, like, right?

1342
01:21:34,973 --> 01:21:37,267
[Sadie] Yeah, we'll come.
We'll all be with you.

1343
01:21:38,351 --> 01:21:40,353
[emotional music playing]

1344
01:22:10,842 --> 01:22:13,261
[Sadie]
Wait, so is this the building right here?

1345
01:22:14,012 --> 01:22:16,139
[Liu] This is the government building.

1346
01:22:17,015 --> 01:22:21,686
You were left on the stairs
to the entrance of the building.

1347
01:22:36,284 --> 01:22:41,247
The Chens live right down here.
I will go in first and talk to them.

1348
01:22:45,377 --> 01:22:46,377
Hello!

1349
01:22:47,420 --> 01:22:51,633
[in Cantonese] Oh, you are cooking here,
Chunjiao? I haven't seen you for so long!

1350
01:22:52,592 --> 01:22:54,719
Why are you cooking so much today?

1351
01:22:54,803 --> 01:22:57,013
Because we have over 20 people today.

1352
01:22:57,097 --> 01:22:59,182
- Are the workers coming today?
- Yes.

1353
01:23:00,392 --> 01:23:01,559
[Liu] Mr. Chen!

1354
01:23:02,060 --> 01:23:03,728
Let me show you the report.

1355
01:23:03,812 --> 01:23:05,605
- Take a seat.
- It's okay.

1356
01:23:09,192 --> 01:23:13,154
It turns out your DNA didn't match.

1357
01:23:13,238 --> 01:23:15,198
It wasn't a match, was it?

1358
01:23:15,699 --> 01:23:17,659
- [Liu] Chunjiao?
- Mm?

1359
01:23:17,742 --> 01:23:21,162
The test results show
that the DNA didn't match.

1360
01:23:21,246 --> 01:23:26,292
- [Chunjiao] No match?
- So, Lily is not your little sister.

1361
01:23:26,376 --> 01:23:27,460
She isn't, is she?

1362
01:23:36,136 --> 01:23:38,638
[Liu] I know you will
find her in the future.

1363
01:23:38,722 --> 01:23:41,975
Even though I'm not sure when,
I think there's a chance.

1364
01:23:42,058 --> 01:23:46,021
Because as the technology develops,

1365
01:23:46,521 --> 01:23:49,733
DNA tests will be more and more common.

1366
01:23:52,152 --> 01:23:55,363
I don't wanna dwell on it.
There's nothing to do.

1367
01:23:56,364 --> 01:23:58,408
It is what it is.

1368
01:23:59,325 --> 01:24:03,621
[chatter continues in Cantonese]

1369
01:24:03,705 --> 01:24:09,210
However, Lily is here today
with her cousins.

1370
01:24:09,294 --> 01:24:12,255
- I wonder if she's welcome...
- Let's meet her, then.

1371
01:24:12,338 --> 01:24:14,674
She also thinks fate brought her here.

1372
01:24:14,758 --> 01:24:17,093
- It's okay for us to meet her.
- Okay.

1373
01:24:17,177 --> 01:24:19,387
I'll let her know now.

1374
01:24:19,471 --> 01:24:21,264
[Liu continues in Cantonese]

1375
01:24:23,224 --> 01:24:24,893
[in English] There's a cute baby.

1376
01:24:25,769 --> 01:24:27,270
- So cute.
- [girls] Aw!

1377
01:24:27,353 --> 01:24:29,522
- [in Cantonese] Lily.
- I recognize her.

1378
01:24:29,606 --> 01:24:31,858
[Liu in English] Hi. This is Mr. Chen.

1379
01:24:32,400 --> 01:24:34,527
[Lily] Hi! Nĭ hăo! [chuckles]

1380
01:24:34,611 --> 01:24:36,529
[Liu] Mr. Chen's daughter.

1381
01:24:36,613 --> 01:24:37,947
[Chen] You really look alike.

1382
01:24:38,031 --> 01:24:40,366
- Nĭ hăo!
- [both chuckle]

1383
01:24:41,284 --> 01:24:43,453
[in Cantonese]
Does she look like me?

1384
01:24:44,245 --> 01:24:45,885
- [Deborah chuckles]
- [Liu] A little bit.

1385
01:24:45,955 --> 01:24:47,791
[all laughing]

1386
01:24:48,750 --> 01:24:49,750
Hello, miss.

1387
01:24:50,710 --> 01:24:51,710
Hello, miss.

1388
01:24:54,130 --> 01:24:55,298
Hello, miss.

1389
01:24:55,381 --> 01:24:57,884
- [Lily chuckles]
- [indistinct chatter]

1390
01:24:58,635 --> 01:25:03,056
- Oh!
- [all] Aw!

1391
01:25:03,139 --> 01:25:05,558
[chattering indistinctly]

1392
01:25:06,142 --> 01:25:08,269
[Liu in English]
She wants to give you the honey.

1393
01:25:13,108 --> 01:25:15,985
- [in Cantonese] Thank you.
- If you want, I can get more.

1394
01:25:17,278 --> 01:25:20,573
- [in English] This honey looks good.
- [Cantonese] Come back to China anytime!

1395
01:25:21,741 --> 01:25:24,119
[Liu in English]
This is Mr. Chen's wife, the mom.

1396
01:25:25,578 --> 01:25:28,414
[in Cantonese] She looks like my daughter,
just like the photo showed.

1397
01:25:28,998 --> 01:25:31,793
Her eyes are like mine, right? Her eyes.

1398
01:25:33,128 --> 01:25:35,880
But she's not the one.
There's nothing I can do.

1399
01:25:35,964 --> 01:25:38,383
[Deborah in English]
Um, I have a whole group of friends

1400
01:25:38,466 --> 01:25:40,760
that have adopted from China,

1401
01:25:40,844 --> 01:25:46,558
and they are all very loved,
with parents that adore them.

1402
01:25:50,520 --> 01:25:53,773
[in Cantonese] I hoped she was the one.
But it is what it is.

1403
01:25:54,816 --> 01:25:57,777
It is not up to what I say, right?

1404
01:26:01,739 --> 01:26:03,158
We have to go, Mr. Chen.

1405
01:26:03,241 --> 01:26:05,451
- [Mr. Chen] Okay.
- Thank you, Mrs. Chen.

1406
01:26:05,535 --> 01:26:06,703
[Mr. Chen] Much obliged.

1407
01:26:07,787 --> 01:26:08,788
[Lily in English] Bye.

1408
01:26:08,872 --> 01:26:10,081
Bye, Chen.

1409
01:26:10,665 --> 01:26:11,958
[Liu] Bye-Bye!

1410
01:26:12,041 --> 01:26:13,041
[Lily] Bye-bye.

1411
01:26:15,753 --> 01:26:17,172
I could tell he was sad.

1412
01:26:18,965 --> 01:26:20,383
His eyes were watering.

1413
01:26:20,466 --> 01:26:24,637
[Liu] Yeah, I felt like he's holding,
because he's a man.

1414
01:26:24,721 --> 01:26:25,805
He can't cry.

1415
01:26:39,194 --> 01:26:41,738
[Lily] I think going to see Mr. Chen
was, honestly, like...

1416
01:26:42,572 --> 01:26:44,532
the hardest thing I've ever done.

1417
01:26:45,366 --> 01:26:47,035
I could just tell he was so sad.

1418
01:26:49,537 --> 01:26:51,289
[choking up] That, like, we didn't match.

1419
01:26:53,708 --> 01:26:56,753
But, like, I was happy
that I got to do that.

1420
01:26:57,462 --> 01:27:01,341
I've just gotten a deeper understanding
of my birth parents.

1421
01:27:02,508 --> 01:27:04,510
I can just see from their point of view.

1422
01:27:04,594 --> 01:27:07,805
No parent would ever
just, like, willingly give up their baby.

1423
01:27:08,556 --> 01:27:09,556
And, like...

1424
01:27:11,434 --> 01:27:14,020
I would just say that it kind of helped.

1425
01:27:20,985 --> 01:27:25,782
[Sadie] <i>I saw how... much
that family wanted to find their child,</i>

1426

when they didn't find her.</i>

1427
01:27:31,496 --> 01:27:35,416
<i>I hope that my birth parents
are searching for me like this family.</i>

1428
01:27:40,129 --> 01:27:43,424
[Chloe] I think it was
a really powerful experience for everyone.

1429
01:27:44,259 --> 01:27:47,011
I think everyone should know that, like,

1430
01:27:47,095 --> 01:27:49,764
their parents probably
loved them very much

1431
01:27:49,847 --> 01:27:54,185
and were heartbroken to give them up, so...

1482
01:30:33,845 --> 01:30:37,056
<i>I remember watching
the movie</i> Tangled <i>for the first time.</i>

1483
01:30:37,974 --> 01:30:42,019
<i>In the movie, the baby is separated
from her parents from a young age.</i>

1484
01:30:42,103 --> 01:30:44,772
<i>And in the end,
she ends up reuniting happily</i>

1488
01:30:54,323 --> 01:30:56,409
<i>Then, I had a realization.</i>

1489
01:30:57,785 --> 01:31:00,663
<i>I might have been searching
for the wrong family.</i>

1490

[Sadie] <i>They know, love,

1493

I've been dying my hair different colors.

1496
01:31:21,684 --> 01:31:23,269
It turned pink again,

1497
01:31:23,352 --> 01:31:25,313
but then, um, when I washed it,

1498
01:31:25,396 --> 01:31:28,691
it kind of faded out,
and it's, I think, ginger!

It must be negative.

You didn't match with Sadie,
but with another girl born in 2000.

Her name is Amanda Phillips.

[shopkeeper] Does she look like me?

1510
01:32:21,327 --> 01:32:22,662
I think so.

1511

[shopkeeper] She speaks English.
