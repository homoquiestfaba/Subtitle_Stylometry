1
00:01:25,199 --> 00:01:28,079
I've never really worked
in a real restaurant before.

2
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:32,239
- I don't...
- You don't have experience.

3
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:37,839
Tell me, honey, what does your father
think about you working in a tavern?

4
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:42,479
Actually, they're both
pretty angry at me right now.

5
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:45,440
- Because of school?
- Yeah.

6
00:01:45,519 --> 00:01:48,320
Nah. I bet they're just
worried about you.

7
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:53,039
There's lots to be worried about
in the world these days.

8
00:01:53,039 --> 00:01:55,440
They just wish
I'd finish the semester.

9
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:58,640
But the people up there...
I don't know.

10
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:01,839
It's not like I'm never
gonna take any classes.

11
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:06,320
I'm thinking I might take
a photography course at community...

12
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:08,839
if the hours didn't, um...

13
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:10,759
- Conflict.
- Yeah.

14
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:16,639
- I might take up accounting for my dad.
- Accounting could be useful.

15
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:21,199
Especially around here.

16
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:24,719
- Yeah, definitely.
- Callie...

17
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:27,759
not everybody's
supposed to go to college.

18
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:30,639
Somebody's gotta roll up
their sleeves and do the work.

19
00:02:30,759 --> 00:02:32,839
- Yep.
- All right.

20
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:35,120
So when do you
want to start?

21
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,399
Goddamn it!

22
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:41,520
Typical. So, honey,
when do you want to start?

23
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:44,239
What do you say tonight? Hmm?

24
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:45,999
Yeah, sure.

25
00:02:45,999 --> 00:02:49,200
I mean, you don't
have to do this, you know?

26
00:02:49,279 --> 00:02:53,679
I mean, if you can use me,
I'm a very committed person.

27
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:56,559
- But Syracuse was a whole different...
- Harry?

28
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,000
Thing.

29
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:02,640
- Oh, here's your check.
- Thanks, Doll.

30
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,919
Oh, watch your step.

31
00:03:05,999 --> 00:03:07,360
Victor?

32
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:12,079
That's my son.

33
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:16,080
He's doin' the bathrooms.

34
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:21,200
Delores, I didn't
expect you in so early.

35
00:03:21,279 --> 00:03:23,920
I want you to meet someone.

36
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:45,160
Sometimes it seems
I can barely breathe

37
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:52,159
The way this world
is worrying me

38
00:04:52,159 --> 00:04:54,160
Let me do it.

39
00:04:54,239 --> 00:04:55,680
Press in the tax...

40
00:04:56,559 --> 00:04:59,359
before you ring through,
or else it's...

41
00:05:00,959 --> 00:05:03,520
Vic! What's going on?

42
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:05,919
The pizza's burned to a crisp.

43
00:05:06,999 --> 00:05:09,280
Callie, honey,
the parmesan's up!

44
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:11,839
Thank you.

45
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:22,960
Looks good.

46
00:05:24,999 --> 00:05:26,840
Only pizzas
come through the slot.

47
00:05:29,119 --> 00:05:30,800
Oh, thank you.

48
00:05:31,999 --> 00:05:35,040
Maybe Dolly figures she'll bring
in some business or something.

49
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:38,559
No. I'm being punished.

50
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:05,279
I gave all my money
to the bank this month

51
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:09,839
I got no more money to spend

52
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:14,079
Smiled when he saw me
comin' through the door

53
00:06:14,079 --> 00:06:15,920
When I left

54
00:06:15,999 --> 00:06:19,039
He said
Come back again

55
00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:23,040
I watched some lonesome
boxcar wheels

56
00:06:23,119 --> 00:06:27,519
Turnin' down the tracks
out of town

57
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:31,600
Some real lonesome
railroad tracks

58
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:34,079
Make two trips, stupid.

59
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:42,800
Looked for my man
in the lost and found

60
00:06:42,879 --> 00:06:47,119
He had already been claimed

61
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:51,440
And I'm gonna find me
a ticket to ride

62
00:06:51,519 --> 00:06:56,079
To a town
never had no name

63
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:00,480
Leo, it's nice having another
pair of hands around...

64
00:07:00,559 --> 00:07:02,320
isn't it?

65
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:07,120
Your heart still beating?

66
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:13,039
I have to keep pressure
on my saliva glands.

67
00:07:24,719 --> 00:07:26,960
Have you ever played spit?

68
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:30,160
It's kind of like solitaire.

69
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:32,639
You know:
One, two, three, spit.

70
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,039
It's got another name,
but I don't remember it.

71
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:38,480
Yeah, I know that one.

72
00:07:38,559 --> 00:07:41,839
It's true, Delores.
You know, Dolly has great teeth.

73
00:07:41,839 --> 00:07:45,039
What is she?
Fifty years older than me?

74
00:07:45,119 --> 00:07:46,720
What?

75
00:07:49,279 --> 00:07:54,079
There's a big old Buick
at the Baptist church

76
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:57,359
Cadillacs at the Church of Christ

77
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:04,079
You can put a six.

78
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:08,319
Pete and Dolly's.

79
00:08:16,559 --> 00:08:19,439
Okay, what can you do?
You can put the king there.

80
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:29,039
You're good.

81
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:32,719
My sister and I, we used to play
every day after school.

82
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:41,799
It's my boyfriend.

83
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:43,920
Mrs. Modino!

84
00:08:43,999 --> 00:08:48,079
My... My boyfriend's here.
Would it be all right if l...

85
00:08:48,919 --> 00:08:52,479
- You can go.
- Thanks. Bye.

86
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:05,760
If you ever see the wheels
of a fast freight train

87
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:08,559
Beatin' out a beautiful tune

88
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:14,479
You ever seen the cold
blue railroad tracks

89
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:16,919
Shinin' by the light of the moon

90
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:19,359
- You!
- What?

91
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:22,480
You better call a cab.

92
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,959
- What are you talkin' about?
- What am I talkin' about? Look at you.

93
00:09:28,559 --> 00:09:31,439
What is this?
Barmaids Against Drunk Driving?

94
00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:34,879
I don't need you
to take me home again.

95
00:09:35,599 --> 00:09:37,519
Fine. I'll save on gas.

96
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:40,639
Take me home again.

97
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:43,279
Sure. You think I'm
one of your boyfriends.

98
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:47,079
No, I'm thinkin' of the
shit-faced photo delivery man...

99
00:09:47,199 --> 00:09:49,799
sittin' in front of me.

100
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:04,880
You know, she's what they used
to call "'the marrying type."

101
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:03,519
Sorry about that.

102
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:34,079
What's her name?

103
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:35,680
Callie?

104
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:47,519
Hey, Victor.

105
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:55,359
There.

106
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:08,479
It's amazing what people
will drop off at the drugstore.

107
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:11,919
Leo, you remember,
this is not an everyday thing.

108
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,840
- The next time, you take it easy.
- Yes, ma'am.

109
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:34,959
You know, Vic, if you don't
use it once in a while...

110
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:37,920
it'll just fall right off.

111
00:12:42,799 --> 00:12:45,760
And when I'm out of cigarettes

112
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:50,319
I think the whole thing's
so cruel

113
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:54,479
It ain't no piece of cake
Life ain't dishin' out

114
00:12:54,559 --> 00:12:58,880
Nothin' that my heart
can't fake

115
00:13:00,879 --> 00:13:04,800
Well, some boys
they might fix your car

116
00:13:04,879 --> 00:13:09,200
Or take you out to eat

117
00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:13,040
Well, some boys
they might play guitar

118
00:13:13,119 --> 00:13:16,720
And sing you somethin' sweet

119
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:22,400
That's all good and proper

120
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:29,839
What's wrong?

121
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:34,799
- Keep singing.
- You're not payin' attention.

122
00:13:34,799 --> 00:13:36,959
I am too. I just looked
at the TV for a minute.

123
00:13:38,319 --> 00:13:40,239
Whatever. It's cool.

124
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,160
Jeff, this is...

125
00:13:44,239 --> 00:13:46,159
- This is like...
- It's fine.

126
00:13:46,159 --> 00:13:48,560
It's the tenth time
I've heard this song tonight.

127
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:51,040
It's the third time.

128
00:13:51,119 --> 00:13:52,319
Whatever.

129
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:54,480
Prevent.
It's preventative health.

130
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:56,640
At the same time,
the Kingston Housing Department...

131
00:13:56,719 --> 00:13:59,120
is offering seniors
a wealth of information...

132
00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:01,600
about everything
from medicine to Medicare.

133
00:14:01,679 --> 00:14:06,159
Seniors have needs that sometimes
are not met because they're afraid...

134
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:21,439
What's the problem
with your son?

135
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:25,519
He's into drugs.
He's a cocaine user.

136
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:28,480
- He's got heavy alcohol problems.
- Does he live at home?

137
00:14:28,559 --> 00:14:31,360
He's tried a couple times,
and I've taken your advice...

138
00:14:31,439 --> 00:14:34,159
on not letting him
stay there for free.

139
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:37,999
That causes nothing but trouble because
my wife says he can stay for free.

140
00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:47,439
Lost eight pounds on that stuff.

141
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:55,919
I had this dream,
and it's been bothering me...

142
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,759
or on my mind
for about a week now.

143
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:01,679
Nanny. Here, honey.

144
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:03,920
There was this individual
telling me...

145
00:16:03,999 --> 00:16:06,319
that I was going
to be getting married...

146
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:10,800
and I would be
getting married to a pilot...

147
00:16:10,879 --> 00:16:12,720
towards the end of August.

148
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:14,719
- Are you dating anybody?
- All right.

149
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:18,559
This may be about you sort
of taking, but he flies away.

150
00:16:18,559 --> 00:16:22,799
It may be that your dream
was flighty or he was flighty.

151
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:25,519
'Cause the unconscious
is a notorious...

152
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:30,000
Bud, your fries
are on their way.

153
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:38,240
Leo, can I get you somethin'?

154
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:42,320
Dell’s gettin' it.
That's okay.

155
00:16:53,919 --> 00:16:57,199
- Chivas neat, right?
- Thanks, Del.

156
00:17:13,799 --> 00:17:15,359
Tommy.

157
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:22,800
The third winning number is two.

158
00:17:22,879 --> 00:17:24,799
Tonight's fourth
winning number is 13.

159
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:27,519
A big white...
a white Borden's truck.

160
00:17:27,559 --> 00:17:29,680
And the next thing I know is...

161
00:17:29,759 --> 00:17:31,200
smash!

162
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:34,080
Some trucker smashed his rig...

163
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:36,680
right into the Borden's...

164
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:39,520
and stopped it...
stopped it five feet from me.

165
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:44,439
And through the smoke
and the steam and everything...

166
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:46,400
walks Burt Lancaster.

167
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,239
Really?

168
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:53,120
I just saw him in a movie.

169
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:57,920
It was really Pete,
but I swear to God, he looked...

170
00:17:57,999 --> 00:18:00,319
just like Burt Lancaster.

171
00:18:01,839 --> 00:18:04,559
And he leaned over and said,
"Hey, kiddo.

172
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:07,039
You okay?"
And I said, "Sure."

173
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:10,879
You didn't know this guy or anything?
He just kind of appeared?

174
00:18:10,919 --> 00:18:13,840
No, not yet.

175
00:18:13,919 --> 00:18:16,320
Pete was...

176
00:18:16,399 --> 00:18:20,639
a trucker,
an interstate trucker.

177
00:18:20,639 --> 00:18:22,880
He was just passing through.

178
00:18:32,559 --> 00:18:34,800
Anyway, the point is...

179
00:18:34,879 --> 00:18:36,919
he put his...

180
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:40,720
whole livelihood in jeopardy
to save me.

181
00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:43,440
It was his truck.
He owned it.

182
00:18:43,519 --> 00:18:45,120
He did that to save me...

183
00:18:45,199 --> 00:18:49,360
a stranger,
out of the goodness...

184
00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:52,439
of his heart.

185
00:18:52,479 --> 00:18:55,999
Good hearts are good things.

186
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:59,439
- That's right, Leo.
- And hard to find.

187
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:01,359
And that too.

188
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:11,639
Can l... Whoa.

189
00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:32,560
Take this, please.
It's getting all lopsided. I'm sorry.

190
00:19:42,239 --> 00:19:45,119
- That's amazing. Wow.
- Not really.

191
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:47,599
Yes, it is.
What are you talking about?

192
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:49,840
You're really good at this.

193
00:19:51,599 --> 00:19:53,840
- I hate making pizza.
- No way.

194
00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:57,280
But he loves making breakfast.

195
00:19:57,359 --> 00:20:00,239
This young man takes
very good care of his mother.

196
00:20:00,319 --> 00:20:03,040
He makes me a whole buffet...

197
00:20:03,119 --> 00:20:05,399
every single morning.

198
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:12,240
What's the name of that school,
that cooking school...

199
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:14,919
the really fancy one
across the river?

200
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:16,559
I think you should go there.

201
00:20:16,679 --> 00:20:18,680
I think that you could
become a great chef.

202
00:20:18,719 --> 00:20:21,120
He already is.

203
00:20:21,159 --> 00:20:24,560
Well, of course he is.
I didn't mean to say that...

204
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:27,320
Callie, they would just
charge us a lot of money...

205
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:29,200
to teach him
what he already knows.

206
00:20:29,959 --> 00:20:31,800
I don't think so.

207
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:35,159
Forgot to slice it, chef.

208
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:59,079
Cursing is not going to make
your argument any more persuasive.

209
00:20:59,159 --> 00:21:00,520
Bullshit!

210
00:21:00,599 --> 00:21:03,959
There comes a time, miss,
when you better think about your future.

211
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:05,960
And what is
the future? Her?

212
00:21:06,039 --> 00:21:08,519
How long do you think she's gonna
hang around this bone orchard?

213
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:11,840
- That's completely up to my son Victor.
- Bullshit!

214
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:14,320
All right, I don't want
any more of this tonight.

215
00:21:14,439 --> 00:21:18,040
You have a bad mouth.
You have a bad reputation.

216
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:20,039
It gets you in trouble
with people...

217
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:22,280
and I do not want
to have it anymore!

218
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:25,480
Somebody writes something on the
bathroom mirror. Who knows who did it?

219
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:27,640
I don't want to talk
about this anymore.

220
00:21:27,719 --> 00:21:29,600
Well, I want to
set this straight.

221
00:21:29,639 --> 00:21:32,759
Somebody writes something on the mirror,
it could be about you.

222
00:21:32,759 --> 00:21:34,839
Yes, I'm sure.

223
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:37,879
I was the one who took home
that big, ugly trucker.

224
00:21:37,879 --> 00:21:40,039
What do you want from me?

225
00:21:40,079 --> 00:21:42,720
I'm a block of ice!
I'm a goddamn celibate!

226
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:45,640
That goes for Leo and every other fuckup
who ever waltzed through here.

227
00:21:47,319 --> 00:21:49,399
Tell me something, Delores.

228
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:53,239
Were you a block of ice
with Pete? Huh?

229
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:56,840
How were you with my husband?
I want to know.

230
00:21:56,919 --> 00:22:00,040
That was 15 years ago.
Fifteen years ago.

231
00:22:00,119 --> 00:22:01,960
Jesus Christ.

232
00:22:06,119 --> 00:22:08,439
- Get away from me!
- You're a slut, Delores!

233
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:11,319
You're a slut!
You've always been one.

234
00:23:06,359 --> 00:23:08,440
What was he like?

235
00:23:08,519 --> 00:23:11,240
- Who?
- Pete.

236
00:23:14,439 --> 00:23:16,919
Sad.

237
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:20,439
Pete was a very sad man.

238
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:23,879
Like me, huh?

239
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:34,199
How's it goin'?

240
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,520
Thanks.

241
00:24:50,839 --> 00:24:55,639
Please tell me a lie

242
00:24:56,840 --> 00:25:02,040
I don't wanna know
the truth anymore

243
00:25:03,319 --> 00:25:08,600
I don't wanna see you
walk out that door

244
00:25:09,639 --> 00:25:14,199
Just tell me a lie

245
00:25:15,239 --> 00:25:20,680
Please tell me a lie

246
00:25:20,759 --> 00:25:23,479
Tell me that you love me

247
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:27,639
Just like before

248
00:25:27,719 --> 00:25:33,959
Tell me that you won't be
leavin' anymore

249
00:25:34,039 --> 00:25:38,360
Just tell me a lie

250
00:25:42,439 --> 00:25:43,959
Sorry.

251
00:25:47,799 --> 00:25:51,879
It's breakin' my heart in two

252
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:56,679
I only know
the sun in the sky

253
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:59,719
Refuses to shine

254
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:04,040
So, darlin'
I am beggin' of you

255
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:07,639
Just tell me a lie

256
00:26:10,279 --> 00:26:13,159
Tell me that you love me

257
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:15,720
Just like before

258
00:26:16,599 --> 00:26:21,399
Tell me that you
won't be leavin' anymore

259
00:26:22,919 --> 00:26:26,439
Just tell me a lie

260
00:26:42,759 --> 00:26:44,520
Very nice.

261
00:26:45,399 --> 00:26:47,800
I like the ones of you
making pizza.

262
00:26:49,799 --> 00:26:51,719
I don't know about that.

263
00:26:58,439 --> 00:27:00,680
You got somethin' on your chin.

264
00:27:00,759 --> 00:27:02,279
Dolly's.

265
00:27:06,199 --> 00:27:09,480
Del, I'm making
the list for Rykoff.

266
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:15,080
Where are you goin'
with the menu?

267
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:27,400
You might think that I'm crazy

268
00:27:30,359 --> 00:27:33,959
- Who's that?
- That's Delores.

269
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:37,079
Last time De Niro won an Oscar

270
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:40,359
Oh, boy.

271
00:27:41,639 --> 00:27:44,600
- That's Dolly.
- Okay.

272
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:47,480
Remember what you had at lunchtime

273
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:50,200
- All right.
- That's nice.

274
00:27:50,279 --> 00:27:53,640
- You guys look really cute together.
- Yeah, you do.

275
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:58,040
Okay, give me that.
Thank you. That's enough.

276
00:27:58,119 --> 00:28:01,479
You gotta be fat
to be free

277
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:03,240
And that's Victor.

278
00:28:03,319 --> 00:28:06,839
You gotta be fat
to be free

279
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:09,800
Is that who Jeff
wrote this song about?

280
00:28:09,879 --> 00:28:12,280
He's never met him before.

281
00:28:14,119 --> 00:28:16,999
Jeff doesn't, uh...
He won't go inside.

282
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:21,080
I don't know. I guess he thinks
they're all trash or something.

283
00:28:21,159 --> 00:28:24,279
To say the words I feel

284
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:28,679
This fancy that I'm on

285
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:32,519
Has been goin' on too long

286
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:36,919
lt's time to stop pretendin'
things are real

287
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,880
To take a chance
on losin' you

288
00:28:41,959 --> 00:28:45,719
Was such a silly thing to do

289
00:28:45,719 --> 00:28:48,039
The chance I might wake up

290
00:28:48,119 --> 00:28:51,480
And find you gone

291
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:55,799
The blue's so blue

292
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:58,279
My love is burnin' blue

293
00:28:58,360 --> 00:29:00,199
Nanny, down.

294
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:03,799
Victor, take Nanny out.

295
00:29:26,279 --> 00:29:28,120
Everything hurts.

296
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,919
Did you eat already?

297
00:29:49,879 --> 00:29:51,959
You mustn't skip breakfast.

298
00:29:52,039 --> 00:29:54,200
It's the most im...

299
00:29:54,279 --> 00:29:56,199
important meal.

300
00:29:58,280 --> 00:30:00,279
I'm fat, Ma.

301
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:03,800
You are not fat.

302
00:30:03,879 --> 00:30:07,480
You are not.
Honey, you're husky.

303
00:30:07,559 --> 00:30:10,520
You're well-built.
You're macho.

304
00:30:11,399 --> 00:30:13,719
I am fat, Ma!

305
00:30:22,679 --> 00:30:24,199
I'm fat.

306
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:42,679
Ma?

307
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:46,919
Paging technician 5890.

308
00:35:58,119 --> 00:36:00,520
She won't wake up
until the morning.

309
00:36:00,599 --> 00:36:02,439
We can call you
if you need...

310
00:36:02,519 --> 00:36:05,480
I mean, you don't
have to stay.

311
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:08,520
You can if you want to.

312
00:36:08,599 --> 00:36:10,679
I can get you a pillow.

313
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:14,999
You wanna talk to the doctor?

314
00:36:21,079 --> 00:36:22,920
Are you sure?

315
00:36:26,439 --> 00:36:29,479
Okay, then. Let us know
if you need anything.

316
00:37:25,079 --> 00:37:29,320
If I kiss somebody,
it just means I'm being friendly.

317
00:37:29,399 --> 00:37:31,799
That may not necessarily
be the case.

318
00:37:31,879 --> 00:37:35,480
So ideas are really for using,
not believing. All right?

319
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:43,960
I got this card once
from the girls over at Caldor's.

320
00:37:44,039 --> 00:37:47,239
I was out for two weeks with mono.
No comments, please.

321
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:49,959
And, uh, it had...

322
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:53,160
This card had a little guy
with a potbelly...

323
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:56,359
and it looked like he was in bed sick,
but when you open up the card...

324
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:58,760
he was actually in bed with
a whole bunch of well-endowed women.

325
00:37:58,839 --> 00:38:01,759
- Lucky guy.
- That's what I thought.

326
00:38:01,879 --> 00:38:06,280
Anyway, uh...
What did it say? Shit.

327
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:09,240
I don't know.
I forgot, but it was funny.

328
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:12,360
I mean, these cards are...

329
00:38:12,439 --> 00:38:15,879
They're sweet and everything,
but funny cards, you know...

330
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:18,120
they cheer you up.

331
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:09,479
Hello?

332
00:39:09,519 --> 00:39:12,519
Sweetheart, do me a favor.

333
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:15,760
I need my nail kit.

334
00:39:15,799 --> 00:39:18,600
It's under the sink
in the bathroom.

335
00:39:25,080 --> 00:39:27,640
I'II bring it tomorrow.

336
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:30,120
I guess it's pretty late.

337
00:39:32,519 --> 00:39:34,680
It's very quiet here too.

338
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:37,520
Are you all right?

339
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:19,640
I love your show,
and I listen to it faithfully.

340
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:21,799
Good woman. Then I won't
give you the pop quiz...

341
00:40:21,879 --> 00:40:23,760
that I was thinking about.

342
00:40:23,799 --> 00:40:27,159
My problem today is that
I have a problem with my sister-in-law.

343
00:40:27,159 --> 00:40:29,960
We were friends before
we were sisters-in-law.

344
00:40:30,039 --> 00:40:34,840
And we were at a family gathering.

345
00:40:34,919 --> 00:40:38,280
They arrived there,
and she didn't speak to me.

346
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:40,959
I speak to her daily.
We talk...

347
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:46,719
Victor, remember...

348
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:52,040
Remember the time
we left you alone?

349
00:40:52,079 --> 00:40:56,960
It was the first time.
It was the Fourth of July, Sunday.

350
00:40:59,599 --> 00:41:01,760
And you...

351
00:41:01,839 --> 00:41:04,959
filled all the Baggies
with colored water.

352
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:09,919
How old were you?
Nine? Ten?

353
00:41:10,039 --> 00:41:12,399
Your father threw a fit.

354
00:41:21,439 --> 00:41:23,680
When your father went...

355
00:41:26,639 --> 00:41:29,679
But then in a little while...

356
00:41:30,879 --> 00:41:32,959
you began to grow.

357
00:41:35,439 --> 00:41:37,280
And it was almost...

358
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:42,640
like I had him back again.

359
00:41:42,719 --> 00:41:46,959
The security guard... We were
goin' down to the ward, right?

360
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:49,760
This little arm just comes right out,
and you hear her screamin' and yellin'.

361
00:41:49,839 --> 00:41:52,640
You should have seen
the look on his face.

362
00:41:54,759 --> 00:41:56,880
- On the third floor.
- Good.

363
00:41:56,959 --> 00:42:01,440
They booked the whole wing,
for the police entourage or whatever.

364
00:42:01,519 --> 00:42:06,080
Witness protection. They should make
assholes like that stand trial, as is.

365
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:36,280
Dr. Rydell, call the operator.

366
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:42,799
Hello?

367
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:48,040
Take whatever you want.

368
00:42:48,080 --> 00:42:50,520
She don't care.

369
00:42:50,639 --> 00:42:54,479
Dr. Ofey, call the operator.

370
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:59,359
Buns are right under the counter.

371
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:01,360
You want me to get you one?

372
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:07,840
Hello?

373
00:43:08,959 --> 00:43:12,279
You a fan, or you
just bought the jacket?

374
00:43:19,919 --> 00:43:21,280
Fan.

375
00:43:22,039 --> 00:43:24,520
Bet you're
a Thurman Munson man.

376
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:27,759
'79! Am I right?

377
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:32,959
Me too.

378
00:43:35,439 --> 00:43:37,280
Hey, bud, look.

379
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:41,519
She don't care.

380
00:43:41,599 --> 00:43:44,320
Just take one. Go on.

381
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:50,880
Pretend you're in heaven.
Anything you want.

382
00:43:50,959 --> 00:43:54,639
Go on! That's it.

383
00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:58,239
Dr. Hill, 295.

384
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:01,280
Yeah.

385
00:44:14,399 --> 00:44:17,760
Big as an ox,
but nobody sees you.

386
00:44:17,839 --> 00:44:20,240
I got the same thing.

387
00:44:20,319 --> 00:44:23,280
Only I ain't big. I just talk loud,
and no one hears me.

388
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:28,399
Then somethin' funny happens.
I start whispering.

389
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:30,719
Suddenly, everyone hears me.

390
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:40,159
You're not sick, are you?

391
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:47,120
Your mother?

392
00:44:54,080 --> 00:44:57,599
That's tough.
That's the toughest one.

393
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:04,000
Except if you lose a kid.

394
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:08,240
Watching a kid die...

395
00:45:08,319 --> 00:45:11,120
that is it.

396
00:45:11,199 --> 00:45:13,040
That's the toughest one.

397
00:45:14,560 --> 00:45:16,159
Are you sick?

398
00:45:17,519 --> 00:45:19,360
Well, they say
I'm gettin' better...

399
00:45:19,439 --> 00:45:23,360
but I don't buy
the green bananas anymore.

400
00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:25,280
They just want me outta here.

401
00:45:30,799 --> 00:45:33,760
Munson, he's our type.

402
00:45:35,439 --> 00:45:37,600
Didn't need a plane crash
to get my attention.

403
00:45:37,600 --> 00:45:40,159
That's what he did though,
you know?

404
00:45:40,159 --> 00:45:42,560
He crashed that plane
right on purpose...

405
00:45:42,639 --> 00:45:44,639
'cause he got sick of it.

406
00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:47,200
Losin' all the lime's light
to Reggie.

407
00:45:47,279 --> 00:45:48,720
Reggie!

408
00:45:50,159 --> 00:45:51,840
Now Reggie gets fat.

409
00:45:52,879 --> 00:45:57,600
Thurman, he's the goddamn
patron saint of baseball.

410
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:05,360
What seems to be the matter?

411
00:47:05,439 --> 00:47:09,920
He's been having
left lower quadrant pain and vomiting.

412
00:47:16,240 --> 00:47:18,479
I think we better
get him to emergency...

413
00:47:50,559 --> 00:47:52,800
I'm gonna need a decaf.

414
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:06,079
Check on those two...

415
00:48:27,120 --> 00:48:29,359
Hey. Okay.

416
00:48:39,919 --> 00:48:42,399
What the hell's a kilo?
Anybody know?

417
00:50:20,479 --> 00:50:22,480
How's Dolly?

418
00:50:26,399 --> 00:50:27,759
Fine.

419
00:50:29,519 --> 00:50:31,599
Can you be
a little more specific?

420
00:50:34,879 --> 00:50:38,319
They took that...
the thing out of her neck.

421
00:50:40,639 --> 00:50:43,840
And that's the end of it?
They got everything? Whatever?

422
00:50:47,759 --> 00:50:50,159
Well...

423
00:50:50,239 --> 00:50:52,640
they're runnin' tests.

424
00:50:55,199 --> 00:50:57,760
I'm gonna need a lift tonight.
My car's dead.

425
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:09,439
Hello?

426
00:51:19,359 --> 00:51:22,000
Hi. It's 94 even.

427
00:51:28,799 --> 00:51:30,400
How's Dolly?

428
00:51:32,639 --> 00:51:34,559
She's fine.

429
00:51:45,280 --> 00:51:48,320
I thought only pizzas
came through the slot.

430
00:52:02,560 --> 00:52:04,640
Oh, sorry.

431
00:52:07,599 --> 00:52:10,160
Let me get that out of your way.

432
00:52:17,199 --> 00:52:19,040
Can you keep this
back here for me, please?

433
00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:21,120
Sure.

434
00:52:22,959 --> 00:52:26,799
You know, I have something...

435
00:53:06,479 --> 00:53:08,560
Make a right. Turn right.

436
00:53:21,760 --> 00:53:23,840
Relax, Victor.

437
00:53:45,839 --> 00:53:47,680
It's great, huh?

438
00:54:11,039 --> 00:54:12,880
What's that?

439
00:54:19,360 --> 00:54:21,199
Can I have one?

440
00:54:30,320 --> 00:54:31,679
Thanks.

441
00:55:31,439 --> 00:55:33,680
Saving yourself
for someone special?

442
00:55:58,560 --> 00:55:59,839
Hello?

443
00:56:00,799 --> 00:56:03,440
Just don't put in anything for now.

444
00:56:14,399 --> 00:56:17,440
I am going through a tough time
in my marriage.

445
00:56:17,519 --> 00:56:20,080
My wife is leaving me...

446
00:56:20,159 --> 00:56:21,679
and...

447
00:56:21,759 --> 00:56:23,679
this is kind of out of the blue.

448
00:56:23,760 --> 00:56:26,800
No, it's not. You may not
have been paying attention...

449
00:56:26,879 --> 00:56:29,120
but very few people,
unless they're psychotic...

450
00:56:29,199 --> 00:56:32,079
just sort of say, "Yesterday
I was happy. Today, I'm outta here."

451
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:55,359
Since they've been known as the world's
most prestigious culinary college...

452
00:56:55,440 --> 00:56:57,360
there are 2,000 students
on campus now...

453
00:56:57,439 --> 00:57:01,039
as compared to the 50 that started
when the Institute was founded.

454
00:57:01,119 --> 00:57:03,120
We'll now head into
our baking and pastry building.

455
00:57:03,199 --> 00:57:06,720
For those of you dining tonight
in the Bounty, note the flags above you.

456
00:57:06,800 --> 00:57:10,000
Those are from the wine-producing states
throughout the country.

457
00:57:10,079 --> 00:57:13,040
Tonight you'll be dining exclusively
on American regional cuisine...

458
00:57:13,120 --> 00:57:15,760
and you'll be drinking
American wines.

459
00:57:20,879 --> 00:57:23,280
Now let me show you
one of our bakeshops...

460
00:57:23,359 --> 00:57:25,760
where our baking and pastry
students are at work...

461
00:57:25,839 --> 00:57:28,719
putting the final details on
what looks like some wedding cakes...

462
00:57:28,800 --> 00:57:31,199
and some breads
and some different pastries.

463
00:57:31,280 --> 00:57:33,119
You'll notice the chef
supervising them.

464
00:57:33,200 --> 00:57:35,279
He has the green and gold
around his collar.

465
00:57:35,360 --> 00:57:38,159
All of these desserts
will be sent to our restaurants...

466
00:57:38,240 --> 00:57:41,439
where they will be served
for lunch and dinner.

467
00:57:41,520 --> 00:57:44,960
Now, we have four different restaurants.
You know about the American Bounty.

468
00:57:45,039 --> 00:57:47,759
We also have Saint Andrew's Cafe
and our Nutrition Center...

469
00:57:47,840 --> 00:57:51,919
which opened in 1989 as a way
to help the public...

470
00:57:51,999 --> 00:57:54,960
have nutritional meals,
since that's what they're asking for.

471
00:57:55,039 --> 00:57:56,880
We also have
a French restaurant...

472
00:58:19,439 --> 00:58:24,159
Jeff, no. Because I can't just quit
on her. She's in the hospital.

473
00:58:26,800 --> 00:58:28,959
That's 'cause that's what I promised.

474
00:58:31,679 --> 00:58:34,159
Yes, because that's
what I promised.

475
00:58:41,279 --> 00:58:43,120
Jeff, please.

476
00:58:45,679 --> 00:58:47,680
I really can't deal
with all this right now.

477
00:58:47,760 --> 00:58:50,000
Please don't do this.
I'm gonna freak out.

478
00:58:58,480 --> 00:59:00,800
I told her
she was gonna drop 'em.

479
00:59:00,879 --> 00:59:03,680
Told her to make two trips.

480
00:59:03,759 --> 00:59:07,520
Jeff, no. Because I can't just quit.
It's not possible.

481
00:59:17,599 --> 00:59:21,839
Why did you come here? I told you
I can't talk now. Why are you here?

482
00:59:21,920 --> 00:59:24,560
This fuckin' place is empty, Callie.
Why can't we talk?

483
00:59:24,639 --> 00:59:26,880
Because we can't. I'm working.

484
00:59:26,959 --> 00:59:29,439
What is goin' on?
I want to know.

485
00:59:29,519 --> 00:59:32,399
Nothing's going on.
Please, I can't talk now.

486
00:59:32,480 --> 00:59:35,199
- All right, whatever.
- Jeff, l...

487
00:59:37,679 --> 00:59:39,999
- Lovers' spat?
- Fuck you.

488
00:59:40,079 --> 00:59:41,280
Excuse me?

489
00:59:44,399 --> 00:59:45,760
Fuck you!

490
00:59:48,560 --> 00:59:50,239
- Little cock-tease.
- Get out of my way!

491
00:59:50,320 --> 00:59:54,000
- And you have a big mouth.
- I do then, don't I?

492
00:59:54,079 --> 00:59:55,599
- I guess you do.
- Come on, girls.

493
00:59:56,400 --> 00:59:58,239
You better stay in there
for a while.

494
01:00:04,160 --> 01:00:05,759
Don't say anything to her.

495
01:01:24,879 --> 01:01:27,280
She's not ready
for this world, huh?

496
01:01:29,999 --> 01:01:32,960
Ma and Pa must treat her
like a goddamn little princess.

497
01:01:36,080 --> 01:01:37,439
Whoa.

498
01:01:45,120 --> 01:01:47,200
Can't you be nicer...

499
01:01:47,279 --> 01:01:49,520
to her?

500
01:01:49,599 --> 01:01:52,639
Nice? Did you hear
what she said to me?

501
01:01:54,399 --> 01:01:58,720
You don't have to be nice,
just be nicer.

502
01:02:01,840 --> 01:02:03,039
Or what?

503
01:02:06,960 --> 01:02:08,320
What?

504
01:02:09,280 --> 01:02:10,800
Or what, Victor?

505
01:02:14,480 --> 01:02:16,319
Or I'll fire you.

506
01:02:17,520 --> 01:02:20,079
Last I heard, your mother
still ran this place!

507
01:02:23,280 --> 01:02:27,280
Hi, I'm late.
Yeah, it's Callie.

508
01:02:27,360 --> 01:02:31,839
Listen, I'm here
at the tavern and...

509
01:02:31,920 --> 01:02:35,119
I got into a really big fight
with Jeff earlier today...

510
01:02:35,200 --> 01:02:38,559
and he's not showing up
to pick me up.

511
01:02:41,279 --> 01:02:44,640
Here he comes.
I'll take care of this.

512
01:02:44,719 --> 01:02:47,599
Maybe you could get the car
and come pick me up.

513
01:02:59,040 --> 01:03:02,320
Don't you think...
I don't know. L...

514
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:06,399
Somebody ought to talk
to that girl.

515
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:10,399
Del don't need that shit.

516
01:03:10,480 --> 01:03:13,839
She said some
pretty nasty things, Vic.

517
01:03:15,199 --> 01:03:17,600
Somebody ought to straighten
that girl out, huh?

518
01:03:17,679 --> 01:03:20,959
What does he do?
He goes to Del.

519
01:03:21,040 --> 01:03:25,039
She's innocent, for Chrissake.
Workin' this crummy joint for 15 years!

520
01:03:25,120 --> 01:03:27,679
Innocent as driven snow!
And he tells her...

521
01:03:27,760 --> 01:03:30,719
Oh, you didn't? You didn't?
Well, I'm glad you didn't.

522
01:03:30,799 --> 01:03:33,119
Because then I would have
to fuck you up, Vic.

523
01:03:33,200 --> 01:03:37,600
Delores is a very fine
lady friend of mine, Vic.

524
01:03:37,679 --> 01:03:42,000
And I don't think that's
the way to treat her. L...

525
01:03:42,079 --> 01:03:44,880
Don't you walk away.
I'm talkin' to you.

526
01:03:52,720 --> 01:03:55,840
Just because your mommy's sick, it
doesn't mean you can shit on people...

527
01:03:55,919 --> 01:03:57,920
you fat fuck.

528
01:04:36,160 --> 01:04:38,640
Can you give me a ride home?

529
01:05:04,879 --> 01:05:07,760
Southern Comfort.
Do you want some?

530
01:05:12,879 --> 01:05:15,440
So did you go
to the hospital today?

531
01:05:18,399 --> 01:05:21,600
Well, do you think you might
go to the hospital tomorrow?

532
01:05:23,439 --> 01:05:27,119
Maybe. Very early.

533
01:05:29,520 --> 01:05:31,840
Well, can I go with you?

534
01:05:33,520 --> 01:05:36,239
Please, Victor?
I really need to talk to Dolly.

535
01:05:37,920 --> 01:05:40,959
A lot of things
have been happening lately.

536
01:06:12,799 --> 01:06:14,640
Why'd you stop?

537
01:06:21,199 --> 01:06:22,959
Holy shit!

538
01:06:24,959 --> 01:06:26,320
Shit!

539
01:06:28,480 --> 01:06:30,639
Oh, my God, that's amazing.

540
01:06:33,280 --> 01:06:34,639
Wow.

541
01:07:01,280 --> 01:07:02,639
Thanks.

542
01:07:19,359 --> 01:07:20,719
Wow.

543
01:07:28,799 --> 01:07:32,400
You know, you're
a really cool person, Victor.

544
01:07:34,959 --> 01:07:37,279
Cooler than someone would think.

545
01:07:40,719 --> 01:07:43,519
And there's more of you
to love, right?

546
01:08:27,759 --> 01:08:29,760
It's okay.

547
01:08:52,879 --> 01:08:55,359
What am I doing
with my life, Victor?

548
01:09:00,719 --> 01:09:03,679
I don't know anything anymore.

549
01:09:29,040 --> 01:09:31,200
I think we should go now.

550
01:11:20,560 --> 01:11:23,359
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

551
01:11:23,439 --> 01:11:26,640
I'm sorry.
You said early.

552
01:11:26,720 --> 01:11:29,720
Do you want me to come back
in an hour or something?

553
01:11:33,440 --> 01:11:35,240
I got your mom
some chocolates.

554
01:11:38,159 --> 01:11:40,000
I thought she'd like that.

555
01:12:39,039 --> 01:12:41,040
Do you think she'll like these?

556
01:12:44,080 --> 01:12:45,439
Open 'em.

557
01:12:51,519 --> 01:12:53,359
Where'd you get that?

558
01:12:56,639 --> 01:13:00,640
Cleaning up behind the booth.

559
01:13:10,080 --> 01:13:13,280
I thought I'd show it to Ma.

560
01:13:35,600 --> 01:13:37,799
Homosexuality,
we say it's okay.

561
01:13:37,919 --> 01:13:41,799
These are things God has said are wrong,
and if our society...

562
01:13:41,919 --> 01:13:43,679
Do you mind if I change this?

563
01:13:43,719 --> 01:13:45,599
Not only aren't they wrong,
they're okay, they're good.

564
01:13:45,599 --> 01:13:48,640
- The problem...
- All right, I see what...

565
01:13:54,399 --> 01:13:57,239
High off the roof we rise

566
01:13:57,359 --> 01:14:01,439
Flying to a hand up in the sky

567
01:14:03,039 --> 01:14:05,520
All the bells in the city ring

568
01:14:05,599 --> 01:14:10,160
- I'm doing my California thing
- My California thing

569
01:14:11,720 --> 01:14:13,600
It was a lie, a lie

570
01:14:13,679 --> 01:14:15,239
A lie

571
01:14:27,600 --> 01:14:30,479
You like these guys?

572
01:14:30,559 --> 01:14:32,079
- I'm doing
- I love 'em.

573
01:14:32,160 --> 01:14:36,160
- They're great. They're real, you know?
- My California thing

574
01:14:36,240 --> 01:14:40,559
- Not like these fake pretty boys.
- I'm doing my California thing

575
01:14:40,640 --> 01:14:42,399
It's happening

576
01:14:44,399 --> 01:14:48,480
Doin' my California thing

577
01:14:52,399 --> 01:14:53,919
All right

578
01:15:17,520 --> 01:15:19,239
What are we doing?

579
01:16:38,479 --> 01:16:40,479
Dolly's dead?

580
01:16:47,920 --> 01:16:49,440
When did it happen?

581
01:16:59,439 --> 01:17:01,199
Two weeks ago.

582
01:17:03,679 --> 01:17:06,720
Nobody knows?

583
01:17:06,760 --> 01:17:08,960
You didn't tell anybody?

584
01:17:20,239 --> 01:17:22,400
Why?

585
01:17:25,800 --> 01:17:28,879
- I don't know.
- You don't know?

586
01:17:37,359 --> 01:17:39,800
I didn't want anything to change.

587
01:18:22,479 --> 01:18:25,239
Everybody's got
off-road vehicles.

588
01:18:32,880 --> 01:18:34,240
Pete & Dolly's.

589
01:18:36,959 --> 01:18:38,760
No, we don't deliver.

590
01:18:42,760 --> 01:18:45,119
So call Domino's then.

591
01:18:50,959 --> 01:18:53,680
Maybe this is her way of quitting.

592
01:18:53,759 --> 01:18:56,160
She didn't pick up her money.

593
01:18:58,759 --> 01:19:01,239
Not that it's any
of my business.

594
01:19:09,200 --> 01:19:11,039
What's goin' on?

595
01:19:12,400 --> 01:19:13,919
I'm hungry.

596
01:19:23,919 --> 01:19:26,480
Any news from
the Listerine factory?

597
01:19:27,919 --> 01:19:29,920
What?

598
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:32,080
What's that look you're giving me?

599
01:19:35,239 --> 01:19:36,959
I'm sorry.

600
01:19:37,040 --> 01:19:39,439
I'm sorry. Okay.

601
01:19:39,520 --> 01:19:41,359
Here's a buck.

602
01:19:44,279 --> 01:19:47,360
Leo, get outta the kitchen.

603
01:19:47,439 --> 01:19:51,119
Go answer the phone
if you feel so at home.

604
01:19:51,200 --> 01:19:52,560
So?

605
01:19:55,600 --> 01:19:59,040
- What?
- What's happening at the hospital?

606
01:19:59,120 --> 01:20:01,439
What's happening
with all the tests?

607
01:20:21,240 --> 01:20:23,119
Christ.

608
01:20:26,479 --> 01:20:28,760
Pete & Dolly's. Hey, Eddie.

609
01:20:28,879 --> 01:20:31,439
Well, let him finish his drink.

610
01:20:31,520 --> 01:20:34,879
I need him to take me home,
unless you will.

611
01:20:34,879 --> 01:20:37,599
Now they tell me
it's the transmission.

612
01:20:41,680 --> 01:20:44,239
No, that's okay.
Why don't you go home.

613
01:20:44,279 --> 01:20:46,880
Feed your bird.

614
01:20:46,959 --> 01:20:50,880
Why don't you get Leo and take him
to the airport and watch the airplanes?

615
01:20:53,200 --> 01:20:56,279
Your sister-in-law?
Yeah.

616
01:20:56,399 --> 01:20:58,239
Over at Mid Hudson?

617
01:21:00,959 --> 01:21:02,759
Two weeks ago?

618
01:21:06,880 --> 01:21:08,479
Yeah.

619
01:21:08,640 --> 01:21:11,199
Yeah, it's just that, we...

620
01:21:11,199 --> 01:21:13,679
I mean, I didn't...

621
01:21:13,760 --> 01:21:16,879
Well, I know, but you know...

622
01:21:19,199 --> 01:21:22,479
- Diana, what's cookin' for the weekend?
- Blue skies and...

623
01:21:27,799 --> 01:21:32,720
The sun will rise tomorrow at 7:03 a.m.
And set at 4:29 p.m.

624
01:21:32,759 --> 01:21:35,199
Now a look at temperatures
around the Valley. In the 30s...

625
01:21:35,239 --> 01:21:38,279
So that was Eddie Hubbard
who called before...

626
01:21:38,399 --> 01:21:40,400
and he said that...

627
01:21:40,479 --> 01:21:43,799
he heard that...

628
01:21:43,919 --> 01:21:45,759
that Dolly...

629
01:21:46,759 --> 01:21:49,120
From his sister-in-law there, over...

630
01:21:49,199 --> 01:21:51,040
She's a nurse at Mid Hudson.

631
01:22:02,079 --> 01:22:04,639
Well, someone's
gotta tell Delores.

632
01:22:09,600 --> 01:22:12,080
What is this,
some insurance thing?

633
01:22:17,120 --> 01:22:18,959
What are you two talkin' about?

634
01:22:23,199 --> 01:22:27,199
Nothin', Del.
Man talk.

635
01:22:27,240 --> 01:22:28,719
Well...

636
01:22:29,760 --> 01:22:32,240
- See you tomorrow.
- See ya.

637
01:22:40,079 --> 01:22:43,799
- What were you doin'?
- Big news.

638
01:22:43,919 --> 01:22:45,760
What's goin' on?
What are you talkin' about?

639
01:22:50,279 --> 01:22:53,600
Gain energy and lose weight
with Light & Fit.

640
01:22:53,679 --> 01:22:57,760
This delicious, thick shake
is today's essential fuel replacement.

641
01:22:57,799 --> 01:23:00,479
All natural, high protein
and nondairy.

642
01:23:00,479 --> 01:23:05,119
- Look and feel...
- Don't wait on Dolly. Dolly's dead...

643
01:23:05,199 --> 01:23:08,399
and he's been sittin' there
sayin' nothin' for two weeks.

644
01:23:08,479 --> 01:23:10,160
- Two weeks?
- Yeah, it's two weeks.

645
01:23:12,160 --> 01:23:13,760
Come on.

646
01:23:13,800 --> 01:23:15,799
Why do you wanna go in there?

647
01:25:31,760 --> 01:25:33,239
Hello?

648
01:25:39,519 --> 01:25:41,359
Oh, my God.

649
01:26:06,080 --> 01:26:08,760
Jeff, maybe we should call
the police or something.

650
01:26:43,919 --> 01:26:45,680
Are you okay?

651
01:26:57,439 --> 01:27:00,640
- She's quitting. She wants her pay.
- Jeff, please.

652
01:27:04,759 --> 01:27:06,960
She's had to deal with all
this bullshit, and she's had enough.

653
01:27:07,040 --> 01:27:09,440
Why don't you
just go outside, okay?

654
01:28:02,319 --> 01:28:05,039
I'm really sorry
about your mother.

655
01:28:07,359 --> 01:28:10,720
And I didn't mean
to get so angry.

656
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:15,840
It was really, really nice...

657
01:28:16,719 --> 01:28:19,439
for you guys to hire me
and everything, but...

658
01:28:21,839 --> 01:28:25,599
I just feel like...

659
01:28:25,680 --> 01:28:29,439
you don't really need the help.

660
01:28:40,959 --> 01:28:43,680
You're a really wonderful
person, Victor.

661
01:28:59,799 --> 01:29:02,040
I have to go now.

662
01:29:12,760 --> 01:29:14,599
Maybe...

663
01:29:15,959 --> 01:29:19,320
you could come by sometime
to visit.

664
01:29:21,719 --> 01:29:24,120
You know, once in a while.

665
01:29:24,120 --> 01:29:26,520
Yeah, sure.

666
01:29:26,520 --> 01:29:27,960
I mean...

667
01:29:32,920 --> 01:29:35,879
I might be going back
to school for a while.

668
01:29:44,759 --> 01:29:46,439
Bye.

669
01:29:50,600 --> 01:29:52,040
Good-bye.

670
01:31:21,639 --> 01:31:22,999
You okay?

671
01:34:53,959 --> 01:34:56,040
Goddamn it!

672
01:35:01,239 --> 01:35:04,279
Oh, my God,
did I knock all those off?

673
01:35:06,040 --> 01:35:07,880
No, just one.

674
01:35:16,679 --> 01:35:18,840
Sorry.

675
01:35:27,560 --> 01:35:30,679
Let me just...
You know, I do that sometimes.

676
01:35:34,200 --> 01:35:38,679
Oh, yeah, I'm a cook.

677
01:35:38,759 --> 01:35:41,639
I don't even think about it.

678
01:35:41,719 --> 01:35:44,600
Sometimes I make something...

679
01:35:44,679 --> 01:35:47,880
and then I don't remember
having made it.

680
01:35:47,959 --> 01:35:50,200
- And I'm not sure I made it.
- You forget.
