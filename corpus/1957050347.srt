00:39:33,152 --> 00:39:34,779
[woman chuckles]

728
00:39:35,990 --> 00:39:37,535
You know, I have to go.
- Oh, just...

729
00:39:37,576 --> 00:39:39,204
Just a few questions.
Please Mrs. Goodwin.

730
00:39:39,246 --> 00:39:41,416
The more we know about
Robbie, the better we can
assist him.

731
00:39:42,084 --> 00:39:44,379
Uh, what sort of trouble
is he in now?

732
00:39:45,465 --> 00:39:47,176
We're not able to
comment, I'm afraid.

733
00:39:47,218 --> 00:39:48,679
We wonder if you
remembered any

734
00:39:48,721 --> 00:39:50,599
strange behavioral
patterns?

735
00:39:50,641 --> 00:39:52,435
[laughs heartily] Oh well.

736
00:39:52,478 --> 00:39:55,065
His crazy mother always
brings him to school sick.

737
00:39:56,275 --> 00:39:58,029
What kind of sickness
did he have?

738
00:39:58,070 --> 00:39:59,615
Oh God, I mean,
you know,

739
00:39:59,656 --> 00:40:02,495
sore throats,
ear infections, you know,

740
00:40:02,536 --> 00:40:04,331
the common cold, you know,
you name it.

741
00:40:04,373 --> 00:40:06,752
- I, I have to go.
- Are you okay?

742
00:40:06,793 --> 00:40:09,048
Uh, [laughs lightly] no.
I- I'm not well.

743
00:40:09,089 --> 00:40:11,593
I'm sorry to keep you
standing. Why don't we sit?

744
00:40:11,635 --> 00:40:12,971
This really won't take
much longer.

745
00:40:13,013 --> 00:40:14,682
You see, I'm sick.

746
00:40:14,724 --> 00:40:16,226
And I really can't...

747
00:40:16,268 --> 00:40:18,439
We just have a few
more things to ask.

748
00:40:18,481 --> 00:40:19,649
[sniffles]

749
00:40:19,691 --> 00:40:21,778
[laughs, crying]
You want to know the truth?

750
00:40:21,819 --> 00:40:24,491
I am trying, [gasps]
to have a complete

751
00:40:24,533 --> 00:40:26,703
nervous breakdown,
and no one will let me

752
00:40:26,745 --> 00:40:28,665
do it in peace!

753
00:40:28,706 --> 00:40:29,666
[giggles]

754
00:40:29,708 --> 00:40:31,211
What's the matter?

755
00:40:31,253 --> 00:40:32,463
Mrs. Goodwin?

756
00:40:33,298 --> 00:40:36,178
- Mrs. Goodwin...
- I hurt everybody.

757
00:40:37,346 --> 00:40:40,268
[shoes squeaking,
patters down hall, crying]

758
00:40:42,272 --> 00:40:44,233
[door opens and shuts]

759
00:40:44,275 --> 00:40:45,945
[crickets chirping]

760
00:40:49,868 --> 00:40:51,872
- Hey.
- Hi.

761
00:40:53,458 --> 00:40:55,336
[sheets rustling]

762
00:40:55,378 --> 00:40:58,091
[sighs, groans]

763
00:41:02,139 --> 00:41:02,849
How'd it go?

764
00:41:03,684 --> 00:41:05,145
- Fine.
- Okay?

765
00:41:05,186 --> 00:41:06,146
Yeah.

766
00:41:14,912 --> 00:41:16,539
[bed creaking]
You alright?

767
00:41:16,582 --> 00:41:18,168
[scoffs] Yes.

768
00:41:19,753 --> 00:41:21,632
[smooches] Hi.

769
00:41:21,673 --> 00:41:22,801
Hi.

770
00:41:27,517 --> 00:41:29,479
[bed creaks, sigh]

771
00:41:29,521 --> 00:41:30,648
- What's the matter?
- Nothing.

772
00:41:32,317 --> 00:41:35,865
[sighs, sheets rustle]

773
00:41:37,868 --> 00:41:39,121
[sharp exhale]

774
00:41:39,997 --> 00:41:41,833
[sighs, deep breath]

775
00:41:43,044 --> 00:41:46,466
[bed creaks, both
breathing heavily]

776
00:41:46,508 --> 00:41:47,719

777
00:41:52,435 --> 00:41:53,729
[sharp exhales]

778
00:42:03,412 --> 00:42:04,665
[wooden bed frame
creaking, sheets rustle]

779
00:42:10,342 --> 00:42:11,552
Hey.
[sniffles]

780
00:42:11,593 --> 00:42:12,888
Hey. [smooch]

781
00:42:15,099 --> 00:42:16,519
Did you get a raise?

782
00:42:16,561 --> 00:42:18,146
[exasperated sigh]

783
00:42:39,099 --> 00:42:40,477
- Are you alright?
- Mm-hmmm.

784
00:42:43,315 --> 00:42:44,442
[chortles]

785
00:42:44,484 --> 00:42:47,698
[chuckle] Wha-
What's so funny?

786
00:42:49,952 --> 00:42:51,121
[groans]

787
00:42:51,162 --> 00:42:52,748
[sniffles]

788
00:42:54,626 --> 00:42:55,336
[groans]

789
00:42:56,421 --> 00:43:00,219
[panting, moaning]
You okay?

790
00:43:01,472 --> 00:43:04,519
[bed creaking, panting,
Alice laughing]

791
00:43:04,561 --> 00:43:05,479
Alice?

792
00:43:05,521 --> 00:43:07,983
- Yes?
- What?

793
00:43:08,025 --> 00:43:09,736
[bed thuds wall]
Come on...

794
00:43:09,778 --> 00:43:12,866
[panting]

795
00:43:12,908 --> 00:43:13,659
[Alice groans unhappily]

796
00:43:13,701 --> 00:43:16,039
[slaps, sheets rustling]

797
00:43:17,291 --> 00:43:19,378
[crying]

798
00:43:20,922 --> 00:43:22,425
[gasps, crying]

799
00:43:26,348 --> 00:43:29,896
[gasping for air]

800
00:43:31,816 --> 00:43:33,861
[loud bang]

801
00:43:34,529 --> 00:43:37,910
[foot steps approach]

802
00:43:37,952 --> 00:43:40,039
In case you hadn't
noticed, there's no food.

803
00:43:40,873 --> 00:43:42,168
[dishes clatter]

804
00:43:42,209 --> 00:43:44,338
[faucet running]

805
00:43:45,465 --> 00:43:47,385
[door clicks]
There's a list on the table.

806
00:43:50,473 --> 00:43:51,517
[can pops, fizz]

807
00:43:52,602 --> 00:43:54,731
[dishes clatter in sink]

808
00:43:57,235 --> 00:43:59,656
Congratulations
for getting up, by the way.

809
00:44:00,241 --> 00:44:02,077
No sweetheart.
No.

810
00:44:03,329 --> 00:44:04,665
[rattling]

811
00:44:04,706 --> 00:44:06,209
Keep in motion, Alice.

812
00:44:06,251 --> 00:44:08,713
For the sake of the kids,
just keep in motion.

813
00:44:08,755 --> 00:44:11,009
[Claire humming,
foot steps recede]

814
00:44:13,388 --> 00:44:14,641
Want a bite?

815
00:44:14,682 --> 00:44:18,105
[tractor hums loudly]

816
00:44:21,945 --> 00:44:23,989
[hinge squeaks]
Emma, get in the car.

817
00:44:27,746 --> 00:44:28,915
Get in the car!

818
00:44:31,252 --> 00:44:32,672
[yells] Get in the car!

819
00:44:36,428 --> 00:44:37,138
[door slams]

820
00:44:42,188 --> 00:44:43,399
[loud thud]

821
00:44:43,441 --> 00:44:46,321
[engine turns over]

822
00:44:47,572 --> 00:44:50,703
Oh, the list.
I forgot the goddamn list.

823
00:44:50,745 --> 00:44:51,705
Stay here!

824
00:44:53,666 --> 00:44:55,753
[mocking tone]
Motion, Alice. Keep in motion.

825
00:44:55,795 --> 00:44:58,968
[tractor engine whirs loudly]

826
00:44:59,009 --> 00:45:02,098
[birds chirping, gravel turns]

827
00:45:07,148 --> 00:45:11,322
[tractor engine roars]

828
00:45:11,364 --> 00:45:12,992
- Alice Goodwin?
- Yes.

829
00:45:13,033 --> 00:45:14,578
We have a warrant
for your arrest.

830
00:45:14,619 --> 00:45:16,706
- Charge of child abuse.
- What?

831
00:45:17,875 --> 00:45:21,715
[tractor humming]

832
00:45:22,383 --> 00:45:23,343
Just come with us, please.

833
00:45:25,221 --> 00:45:26,849
Right this way.
Towards the car.

834
00:45:26,891 --> 00:45:29,979
[engine humming]

835
00:45:30,939 --> 00:45:32,108
Put your hands
on the front of the car.

836
00:45:32,149 --> 00:45:33,109
Howard!

837
00:45:35,489 --> 00:45:36,699
Howard!

838
00:45:36,741 --> 00:45:38,411
You have the right
to an attorney,

839
00:45:38,452 --> 00:45:40,205
if you cannot afford one,
one will be appointed
by the courts.

840
00:45:40,248 --> 00:45:40,998
[Howard; yells] Alice!

841
00:45:41,875 --> 00:45:43,753
[pattering]
Alice?

842
00:45:43,795 --> 00:45:45,548
Howard!

843
00:45:45,589 --> 00:45:47,635
Robbie Mackessy says
I did awful things.

844
00:45:47,677 --> 00:45:48,762
What's going on?

845
00:45:48,804 --> 00:45:50,223
I'm in trouble, Howard.

846
00:45:50,265 --> 00:45:51,768
- Will someone please expl-
- Read the piece of paper.

847
00:45:51,809 --> 00:45:53,478
- Explain to me what's goin-
- Howard...

848
00:45:53,521 --> 00:45:55,148
What's this? I don't have time
to read this.

849
00:45:55,189 --> 00:45:56,568
What you need to do,

850
00:45:56,609 --> 00:45:58,654
what you need to do
is take care of the girls.

851
00:45:58,696 --> 00:46:00,491
I'll call as soon as
I sort this out.

852
00:46:00,532 --> 00:46:01,952
- Ma'am.
- No, please, giv-

853
00:46:01,993 --> 00:46:03,121
- Give me a minute!
- I'm going with you.

854
00:46:03,162 --> 00:46:04,915
- No! No Howard.
- Alice, I...

855
00:46:04,957 --> 00:46:06,334
Girls!

856
00:46:06,376 --> 00:46:07,545
Girls!

857
00:46:07,586 --> 00:46:08,672
Sir, why is she being
arrested, please...

858
00:46:08,713 --> 00:46:09,632
Oh, sweethearts,

859
00:46:09,673 --> 00:46:10,842
be good okay?

860
00:46:11,468 --> 00:46:12,595
[smooches]

861
00:46:13,221 --> 00:46:15,141
- Listen to Daddy.
- Ma'am let's go.

862
00:46:16,268 --> 00:46:17,562
- Stay in the car!
- Where is she going?

863
00:46:17,604 --> 00:46:19,106
[Alice] Do we
have a lawyer?

864
00:46:19,148 --> 00:46:20,568
No, we don't have
a lawyer.

865
00:46:20,609 --> 00:46:23,405
There's a guy, there's a guy
in Racine. His name is...

866
00:46:23,448 --> 00:46:24,825
...is Reverdy.
Theresa knows him.

867
00:46:24,866 --> 00:46:26,619
He's supposed to be
the best, okay?

868
00:46:26,661 --> 00:46:27,705
Call him!

869
00:46:27,746 --> 00:46:29,458
[chatter, gravel scrapes]

870
00:46:30,585 --> 00:46:32,087
Officer, is there somebody
I can call?

871
00:46:32,129 --> 00:46:33,422
Wh- who do I call?

872
00:46:33,465 --> 00:46:35,051
[Claire crying,
doors thud shut]

873
00:46:35,092 --> 00:46:37,346
[engine turns over]

874
00:46:49,409 --> 00:46:50,244
Alice!

875
00:46:51,496 --> 00:46:52,915
[Emma panting]
Alice, wh-

876
00:46:52,957 --> 00:46:54,709
Come here. Come here!

877
00:46:54,752 --> 00:46:59,259
[gravel scraping]

878
00:47:06,731 --> 00:47:09,109
[phone rings]

879
00:47:12,073 --> 00:47:14,536
[phone rings]
Daddy!

880
00:47:17,041 --> 00:47:19,252
[phone rings]

881
00:47:22,258 --> 00:47:24,428
[phone rings]

882
00:47:24,469 --> 00:47:26,265
[Emma groans in pain]

883
00:47:26,306 --> 00:47:28,268
- Hello?
[Emma] Ow...

884
00:47:29,311 --> 00:47:30,647
Hello?

885
00:47:30,689 --> 00:47:32,567
[crying] Ow, Daddy!

886
00:47:32,609 --> 00:47:35,071
[crying] Ow...

887
00:47:35,113 --> 00:47:38,161
[crying]

888
00:47:40,456 --> 00:47:42,418
[band-aid peels]

889
00:47:42,459 --> 00:47:44,713
Mommy doesn't
do it that way.

890
00:47:44,755 --> 00:47:47,426
[phone rings]

891
00:47:48,469 --> 00:47:49,638
[loud tumbling]

892
00:47:49,681 --> 00:47:52,351
- Hello, yes?
[Alice] This is my one call.

893
00:47:52,393 --> 00:47:53,269
What?

894
00:47:53,311 --> 00:47:54,438
This should teach me,
Howard.

895
00:47:54,481 --> 00:47:56,651
Did you read the warrant?

896
00:47:56,692 --> 00:47:59,238
Robbie Mackessy says
I did things to him. [scoffs]

897
00:47:59,281 --> 00:48:01,659
His mother has had it in
for me for years.

898
00:48:01,701 --> 00:48:03,579
I said to the deputies
in the car, I said,

899
00:48:03,621 --> 00:48:05,082
"Aren't you sick of this
kind of thing?

900
00:48:05,124 --> 00:48:06,585
[Alice] You call this
child abuse?"

901
00:48:06,626 --> 00:48:08,588
You know last year,
a third grader

902
00:48:08,629 --> 00:48:10,549
was charged with
fourth degree abuse

903
00:48:10,591 --> 00:48:12,302
for pulling another boy's
pants down

904
00:48:12,345 --> 00:48:13,305
on the playground.

905
00:48:13,346 --> 00:48:15,475
Alice, why?
Why you?!

906

01:39:47,006 --> 01:39:49,385
in the same restaurant where
Carole Mackessy worked.

1795
01:39:50,261 --> 01:39:52,975
Norman Frasier's mother
is her hairdresser,

1796
01:39:53,016 --> 01:39:56,648
and Donna Stuck's mother
is her best friend.

1797
01:39:56,689 --> 01:39:59,903
[laughing, chortling]
I leaked this coincidence,

1798
01:39:59,945 --> 01:40:03,326
and miraculously, all three
dropped their charges.

1799
01:40:03,368 --> 01:40:05,663
[pounding desk]
Even better!

1800
01:40:06,498 --> 01:40:08,459
The judge has approved
my motion to keep

1801
01:40:08,501 --> 01:40:11,131
any mention of Lizzy,
the drowning,

1802
01:40:11,172 --> 01:40:12,884
the whole episode...

1803
01:40:12,926 --> 01:40:14,219
out! [snaps]

1804
01:40:14,261 --> 01:40:15,388
It's inadmissible.

1805
01:40:17,016 --> 01:40:18,644
And for dessert...

1806
01:40:18,686 --> 01:40:22,275
God. We have Mrs. Shepherd.
Oh...

1807
01:40:22,317 --> 01:40:24,905
You are going to love her!

1808
01:40:24,946 --> 01:40:25,739
Love her!

1809
01:40:27,117 --> 01:40:29,579
She's gonna be our,
o-our [stammers] star witness

1810
01:40:29,621 --> 01:40:30,957
with higher billing
than even you!

1811
01:40:32,543 --> 01:40:33,795
Having fun?

1812
01:40:33,837 --> 01:40:35,715
I wouldn't be any good
if I didn't.

1813
01:40:35,757 --> 01:40:36,675
But,

1814
01:40:36,717 --> 01:40:38,261
you can rest assured,

1815
01:40:38,303 --> 01:40:41,099
rest assured that I'm
enjoying the prospect

1816
01:40:41,141 --> 01:40:44,605
of getting our story,
the real story, [snaps] out!

1817
01:40:46,985 --> 01:40:49,572
So she unzipped
the pants first,

1818
01:40:49,615 --> 01:40:51,075
and then
she unbuttoned them?

1819
01:40:51,117 --> 01:40:52,202
I forget!

1820
01:40:52,244 --> 01:40:53,955
Do you like
your Mom's boyfriends?

1821
01:40:53,997 --> 01:40:54,999
Objection.

1822
01:40:55,041 --> 01:40:59,423
Your t.v. has 64 channels.
Wow!

1823
01:41:00,425 --> 01:41:03,263
And your mom lets you
watch whatever you want?

1824
01:41:03,305 --> 01:41:04,599
Yep!

1825
01:41:04,641 --> 01:41:06,602
Do your mother's boyfriends
ever stay the night?

1826
01:41:06,644 --> 01:41:07,896
Objection!

1827
01:41:07,938 --> 01:41:10,317
Did you ever see
naked people on t.v.?

1828
01:41:10,359 --> 01:41:11,319
[sniffling]

1829
01:41:12,279 --> 01:41:14,157
Is the court paying for tissue?

1830
01:41:16,161 --> 01:41:17,621
[young boy] She tied
me to the chair.

1831
01:41:17,663 --> 01:41:18,915
She tied you to the chair?

1832
01:41:18,957 --> 01:41:20,835
- She said she'd bite me.
- Did she bite you?

1833
01:41:20,877 --> 01:41:22,463
She said she'd bite me
if I moved.

1834
01:41:22,505 --> 01:41:23,965
She said my blood
would come out!

1835
01:41:24,008 --> 01:41:25,135
Your blood?

1836
01:41:27,263 --> 01:41:29,016
She always pushed me down.

1837
01:41:29,058 --> 01:41:31,979
So, the nurse, tied you
to the chair,

1838
01:41:32,021 --> 01:41:33,524
and pushed you down.
- Yes.

1839
01:41:33,565 --> 01:41:34,985
And she bit you.

1840
01:41:35,026 --> 01:41:36,738
Yes!

1841
01:41:36,779 --> 01:41:40,536
So Mrs. Goodwin tied you
to the chair, pushed you down,
and bit you?

1842
01:41:40,578 --> 01:41:42,623
[yells] Stop asking me that,
you're hurting me!

1843
01:41:42,665 --> 01:41:43,875
I'm hurting you?

1844
01:41:43,917 --> 01:41:45,628
[yells] I said,
you're hurting me!

1845
01:41:46,463 --> 01:41:48,132
No further questions,
your honor.

1846
01:41:50,303 --> 01:41:53,349
[car hums]

1847
01:41:55,437 --> 01:41:56,814
[brake locks]

1848
01:41:57,816 --> 01:41:58,776
You know I wish...

1849
01:41:59,986 --> 01:42:00,988
You wish?

1850
01:42:01,823 --> 01:42:02,741
What do you wish?

1851
01:42:05,412 --> 01:42:07,416
That that Robbie Mackessy
had been the one to drown.

1852
01:42:08,501 --> 01:42:10,463
Oh Howard, not now.

1853
01:42:10,505 --> 01:42:12,383
Well wouldn't he be
better off at this point?

1854
01:42:15,012 --> 01:42:17,099
I swear I've never met
anybody like Reverdy before.

1855
01:42:17,809 --> 01:42:19,103
Makes me sick.

1856
01:42:19,145 --> 01:42:20,397
Makes me feel like
I want to vomit.

1857
01:42:20,439 --> 01:42:22,149
Uh-huh. I'm gonna
get the girls. [door clicks]

1858
01:42:22,192 --> 01:42:24,069
Or we'll be charged
for the next hour.

1859
01:42:24,112 --> 01:42:25,781
You know, you never
listen to me!

1860
01:42:27,159 --> 01:42:28,077
You know that?

1861
01:42:31,208 --> 01:42:32,585
[door thuds]
Howard...

1862
01:42:33,545 --> 01:42:34,881
I am listening.

1863
01:42:35,757 --> 01:42:37,677
I just don't know
what else to say.

1864
01:42:38,178 --> 01:42:40,223
Robbie didn't drown.
Lizzy did.

1865
01:42:40,724 --> 01:42:42,685
If not Reverdy, who?

1866
01:42:42,728 --> 01:42:44,021
Maybe I should have
copped a plea,

1867
01:42:44,063 --> 01:42:45,858
and served a sentence.
Would you have liked that?

1868
01:42:46,734 --> 01:42:49,739
I could say 'I'm sorry'
every minute for the rest

1869
01:42:49,781 --> 01:42:51,576
of my life, and it still
wouldn't be enough.

1870
01:42:52,494 --> 01:42:54,957
I'm sorry for Lizzy,
I'm sorry for Robbie,

1871
01:42:54,998 --> 01:42:56,459
I'm sorry for Theresa,

1872
01:42:56,501 --> 01:42:58,838
I am sorry Reverdy
makes you sick.

1873
01:42:58,881 --> 01:43:02,178
I'm sorry for you,
and for Emma, and for Claire.

1874
01:43:02,721 --> 01:43:04,515
I'm sorry!

1875
01:43:04,557 --> 01:43:07,604
I am just plain sorry!

1876
01:43:07,645 --> 01:43:09,941
And maybe, just maybe...

1877
01:43:09,983 --> 01:43:12,112
Reverdy will get me off.

1878
01:43:12,154 --> 01:43:13,906
And we can try
to begin again.

1879
01:43:15,368 --> 01:43:16,954
Or whatever.

1880
01:43:17,663 --> 01:43:18,539
[door clicks]

1881
01:43:20,709 --> 01:43:21,294
[slam]

1882
01:43:21,336 --> 01:43:23,965
[stomping]

1883
01:43:28,181 --> 01:43:30,101
I didn't believe him
at first.

1884
01:43:30,936 --> 01:43:32,564
Then he started
getting nightmares.

1885
01:43:33,357 --> 01:43:34,734
Would you like some water?

1886
01:43:34,776 --> 01:43:36,779
[sniffles] No, ma'am.

1887
01:43:37,489 --> 01:43:38,574
Please continue.

1888
01:43:39,576 --> 01:43:40,745
[deep inhale]

1889
01:43:40,786 --> 01:43:42,248
I didn't know
what to think. [cries]

1890
01:43:43,332 --> 01:43:46,505
I kept asking him,
and he told me the same

1891
01:43:46,546 --> 01:43:48,508
story over and over.
[sobbing]

1892
01:43:48,549 --> 01:43:51,096
And I still didn't believe him.

1893
01:43:52,181 --> 01:43:53,141
[sniffles]

1894
01:43:54,142 --> 01:43:56,021
Then he started
wetting the bed.

1895
01:43:59,277 --> 01:43:59,945
[sniffles]

1896
01:44:01,114 --> 01:44:03,201
I just knew something
bad had happened.

1897
01:44:05,872 --> 01:44:06,581
So...

1898
01:44:07,625 --> 01:44:11,339
You came to the house
to have sex?

1899
01:44:11,381 --> 01:44:12,508
Correct.

1900
01:44:12,549 --> 01:44:14,845
After the sex,

1901
01:44:14,887 --> 01:44:16,389
did you ever spend
the night?

1902
01:44:17,225 --> 01:44:17,892
No.

1903
01:44:20,021 --> 01:44:21,941
Where was Robbie...

1904
01:44:21,982 --> 01:44:23,945
when, you and...

1905
01:44:25,447 --> 01:44:27,117
his mother were...

1906
01:44:27,158 --> 01:44:28,702
...having sex?

1907
01:44:30,081 --> 01:44:31,165
I don't know.

1908
01:44:32,125 --> 01:44:33,669
Robbie came to my door.

1909
01:44:35,047 --> 01:44:36,382
He looked so frightened.

1910
01:44:38,094 --> 01:44:39,764
He took me by the hand...

1911
01:44:40,849 --> 01:44:42,059
Where did he take you?

1912
01:44:44,229 --> 01:44:45,816
He took me into his house.

1913
01:44:46,985 --> 01:44:47,902
Into the den.

1914
01:44:50,241 --> 01:44:52,077
This isn't easy for me.

1915
01:44:53,662 --> 01:44:55,165
I appreciate that.

1916
01:44:55,207 --> 01:44:57,378
Mrs. Shepard,
what did you see?

1917
01:44:58,964 --> 01:45:00,549
It was dark,

1918
01:45:00,591 --> 01:45:02,052
the music was loud.

1919
01:45:04,098 --> 01:45:05,141
But I could see her.

1920
01:45:06,226 --> 01:45:07,437
Mrs. Mackessy.

1921
01:45:08,647 --> 01:45:09,774
Naked.

1922
01:45:10,901 --> 01:45:12,028
Tied to a chair.
[voice breaks]

1923
01:45:13,822 --> 01:45:15,492
And a man was behind her.

1924
01:45:17,454 --> 01:45:18,622
Biting her neck.

1925
01:45:24,717 --> 01:45:25,969
I'm gloating.

1926
01:45:28,598 --> 01:45:30,142
I'll pay for it someday.

1927
01:45:31,645 --> 01:45:33,022
But I can't help it
right now.

1928
01:45:34,525 --> 01:45:35,778
I'm gloating.

1929
01:45:37,238 --> 01:45:38,198
What is it Alice?

1930
01:45:40,745 --> 01:45:41,662
[handle rattles,
hinges squeak]

1931
01:45:47,965 --> 01:45:48,758
Surprise.

1932
01:45:51,221 --> 01:45:53,266
Yes, we were
neighbors and friends.

1933
01:45:53,725 --> 01:45:55,311
Did your children
play together?

1934
01:45:55,938 --> 01:45:57,774
Very often.
Several times a week.

1935
01:45:58,985 --> 01:46:00,278
Did you ever...

1936
01:46:00,862 --> 01:46:03,826
...suspect Alice Goodwin of...

1937
01:46:04,578 --> 01:46:07,666
Neglect? Or foul play?

1938
01:46:07,708 --> 01:46:08,542
No.

1939
01:46:09,335 --> 01:46:11,005
You never saw anything..
Any...

1940
01:46:12,425 --> 01:46:15,012
Signs, or any flares
to alert you?

1941
01:46:15,054 --> 01:46:15,847
Never.

1942
01:46:17,225 --> 01:46:19,061
Your daughter was always
happy to go t-

1943
01:46:19,102 --> 01:46:20,105
Daughters.

1944
01:46:21,357 --> 01:46:21,899
I'm sorry.

1945
01:46:23,360 --> 01:46:25,614
Your daughters were always
happy to go to the Goodwins?

1946
01:46:26,198 --> 01:46:27,909
Yes. Thrilled.

1947
01:46:30,498 --> 01:46:31,708
Would you allow...

1948
01:46:31,749 --> 01:46:34,212
your daughter to stay
unchaperoned

1949
01:46:34,254 --> 01:46:36,132
with the Goodwin family
at this time?

1950
01:46:37,468 --> 01:46:39,931
I can't impress upon you
enough that Alice

1951
01:46:39,972 --> 01:46:41,851
would never inflict...
[stammers]

1952
01:46:41,892 --> 01:46:43,520
She never did
any of those things.

1953
01:46:44,188 --> 01:46:45,774
Objection.

1954
01:46:45,815 --> 01:46:47,444
Answer the question please.

1955
01:46:47,485 --> 01:46:48,612
Mrs. Collins...

1956
01:46:51,826 --> 01:46:54,414
Would you allow your
daughter to stay

1957
01:46:54,455 --> 01:46:57,502
unchaperoned
with the Goodwin family

1958
01:46:57,544 --> 01:46:58,588
at this time?

1959
01:47:01,760 --> 01:47:02,511
Yes.

1960
01:47:09,148 --> 01:47:10,191
Woo!
[girls giggle]

1961
01:47:10,234 --> 01:47:14,157
[girls scream happily]

1962
01:47:17,287 --> 01:47:18,706
[Alice] Sexual abuse,

1963
01:47:18,748 --> 01:47:21,419
reckless endangerment,
child abuse.

1964
01:47:21,461 --> 01:47:23,172
[Reverdy]
And how did you plead?

1965
01:47:23,214 --> 01:47:24,382
Not guilty.

1966
01:47:25,342 --> 01:47:27,555
And how did you find the jail?

1967
01:47:27,597 --> 01:47:28,640
Objection.

1968
01:47:30,101 --> 01:47:31,395
Your honor,

1969
01:47:31,437 --> 01:47:33,524
I think my client
deserves the chance

1970
01:47:33,565 --> 01:47:36,195
to say a few sentences
about the time she spent

1971
01:47:36,237 --> 01:47:38,365
