1
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:20,600
Hold on!

2
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:22,360
S. F.P.D.

3
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:24,280
Okay, go ahead.

4
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:07,200
Come on, baby.

5
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:10,800
Here you go.

6
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:14,800
Yes! We're in.

7
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:23,840
This is our last shot.

8
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:27,440
Should've tried this six weeks ago
instead of wasting time...

9
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:29,720
with those television appeals.

10
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:32,520
Now we go finer.

11
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:36,840
If they all go away, we're finished.

12
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,960
Don't even think about it.

13
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:57,160
We got one! We got one!

14
00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:00,080
Don't make a sound.

15
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,720
Thank you.

16
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:08,520
Oh, man.

17
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:17,160
He crushed his cell mate's legs, so they
put him in solitary through the year.

18
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:19,400
He's the real thing.

19
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:24,240
No formal education beyond the ninth
grade, but he has an IQ of over 150.

20
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:26,160
I appreciate what
you're doing for me.

21
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:28,920
McCabe has escaped twice.

22
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,480
Second time he took
two guards hostage.

23
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:33,800
Buried them alive,
used their uniforms and l.D.s.

24
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:37,360
If he'd done it two years later, they
would've put him in the gas chamber.

25
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:38,800
Jesus!

26
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:45,240
This is a mistake, Frank.

27
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:47,720
I have no choice.

28
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:00,000
McCabe!

29
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:02,440
McCabe!

30
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:11,120
You have a visitor.
Get dressed.

31
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:55,760
I have to warn you not just about
the physical danger...

32
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:58,520
because he's already killed one prisoner
and crippled another.

33
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:01,200
Also, McCabe is very sharp.

34
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:03,800
He likes to fuck with you.

35
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:24,640
Frank Connor.

36
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:27,600
You know why I'm here.

37
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,520
My son has leukemia.

38
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:36,360
He will die
without a bone marrow transplant.

39
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:44,320
He's only nine years old.

40
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:51,960
And somehow, somehow...

41
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:57,080
I've been identified
as a compatible donor...

42
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:59,160
for your son.

43
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:01,600
I was told you volunteered.

44
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:04,680
We're through here.

45
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:07,200
Officers!

46
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:12,280
You lied to me, Frank.

47
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:15,200
You were identified by a computer match.

48
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:20,560
I broke into the FBI computer system.
I violated state and federal statutes.

49
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:22,880
Grounds for dismissal
from the police force.

50
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,240
Right?

51
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:27,120
That's right.
Give me a shot.

52
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:29,040
What's the problem?

53
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:32,640
No problem.

54
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:34,600
My mistake.

55
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:43,240
I went through all the other registries,
and there's nobody.

56
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:45,160
You're our last chance.

57
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:54,840
- What do I get out of it?
- You get to save my son's life.

58
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:57,360
Why do I care about your son's life?

59
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:02,600
Am I supposed to find redemption
in the eyes of God?

60
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:05,200
Do you want redemption?

61
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:07,160
You think I do?

62
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:10,120
You brought it up.

63
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:16,440
Don't try to get inside my head,
Frank.

64
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:23,000
If I want you in,
I'll send you an invitation.

65
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:26,280
Sorry. I thought
you were opening a door.

66
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:27,720
I killed...

67
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:31,440
a lady in a hat, a guy in a store.

68
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:34,000
That was real.

69
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:35,880
That happened.
I did it.

70
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:39,400
But I cannot make myself
feel bad about it.

71
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:42,080
I cannot imagine a god who would care.

72
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:45,480
I put my faith in the power
of my own mind.

73
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:48,760
Which is all I own
after half a life of incarceration.

74
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,600
I can appreciate that.

75
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:52,040
Really?

76
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:57,800
Then maybe you can appreciate
my amusement...

77
00:09:57,880 --> 00:10:01,400
at the irony, that now...

78
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:06,320
after all those years being locked up,
I'm given the opportunity to kill again.

79
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:09,120
Cop's kid, at that.

80
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:12,040
All I've got to do is stay here.

81
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:16,640
What do you want from me?

82
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:20,240
-Have you been a good father to the boy?
-I've tried.

83
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:26,120
You tried.
Isn't that nice you tried?

84
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:28,600
Yep. Even my daddy can say that.

85
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,680
Beat the shit out of me every day,
but he tried.

86
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:35,520
I've never hit Matt.

87
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:37,680
I'm sure you didn't.

88
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,360
Where's the boy's mother?

89
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:49,800
She's dead.

90
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:54,240
You still wear a ring.

91
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:57,040
You feel responsible in some way
for her death?

92
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:00,880
She died in a car accident.

93
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:02,320
Dead wife.

94
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:06,480
Kid with cancer.

95
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:10,000
I'd wonder about myself, too.

96
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,960
Will you do it?

97
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:18,920
Will you give my son your bone marrow?

98
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:22,880
I'll have to think about that,
get back to you.

99
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:25,920
No. Tell me right now.

100
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,400
Why?

101
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:30,640
Because I haven't told him
that his cancer is back.

102
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:35,520
And when he went into remission...

103
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:38,480
he wouldn't even
let himself celebrate...

104
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:41,120
'cause he knew the odds.

105
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:44,440
And when I go back, I'm gonna tell him
that his cancer is back...

106
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:48,560
and that he will die if he doesn't get
a bone marrow transplant.

107
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:51,320
I want to tell him
that I found that donor.

108
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:54,840
- And I want to give him hope.
- To make it easier for you.

109
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:02,240
To make it easier for him,
and to save his life.

110
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:10,000
Well, since you have to know
right now, Frank...

111
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:17,280
my answer is no.

112
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:18,240
Officers!

113
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:23,160
That's not acceptable.

114
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:51,040
We'll need more topicide.

115
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:53,600
I'll get back to you.
Mr. Connor.

116
00:12:58,280 --> 00:13:01,320
- Hi, Doctor. How are you?
- Good morning.

117
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:05,080
Can we sit in my office a few moments?
I'd like to talk to you about Matt.

118
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:06,520
Why?

119
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:09,360
- I prefer to do this in private.
- Tell me right now.

120
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:13,920
I've learned about Peter McCabe planning
to be a donor, and I'm concerned.

121
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:18,120
Matt has blood in his urine.
His creatine levels are up.

122
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:21,960
And without a transplant,
we have very little time.

123
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:25,560
- Where is he?
- He's resting. Give him a moment.

124
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:28,320
I'm concerned about you, too.

125
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:32,760
I've learned one thing in a specialty
where you can lose many patients.

126
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:37,080
- You have to care for the family.
- Matt is not going to die.

127
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:39,840
We won't give up hope.

128
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:42,640
You may want someone to talk to.
The hospital has counselors.

129
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:45,880
For what? To adjust to my son dying?

130
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:48,400
I don't want to adjust to my son dying.
May I see him now?

131
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:49,840
Absolutely.

132
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:59,160
Why don't you ask Gladys?

133
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:01,440
Can you build a rocket ship
out of tongue depressors...

134
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:03,960
without using glue or other adhesives?

135
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,840
That holds together without glue?

136
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:07,280
Yeah.

137
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:09,880
Dad, look.

138
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:13,800
He's going to be an architect.

139
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:15,680
- Thank you, Gladys.
- How are you doing?

140
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:20,600
- How are you feeling?
- Not so great.

141
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:25,920
Thanks, Dad.

142
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:29,160
Yes!

143
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:31,920
Cool, huh?
Move over.

144
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,320
We saw this in the library.

145
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,640
P-47 Thunderbolt.

146
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,320
- See the Thunderbolt?
- What is that?

147
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:53,880
Its nickname is "Little Demon."

148
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:55,880
There's a little demon.
I think it's...

149
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:58,280
some sort of crazy monster.

150
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:06,320
The cancer's back, isn't it?

151
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:12,240
Yes.

152
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,120
B-24 bomber.
This guy's nickname--

153
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:21,400
I think I found a donor...

154
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:24,200
for a bone marrow transplant.

155
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:26,880
- Really?
- Yeah.

156
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:29,280
- Is he compatible?
- He's compatible.

157
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:31,600
But he's thinking it over.

158
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:34,000
He might not want to?

159
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:41,440
He'll do it.

160
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:46,880
Dad, if he doesn't--

161
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,200
What do you mean, "if he doesn't"?
What did I just say?

162
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:54,400
Even if he doesn't,
or my body rejects the transplant--

163
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:56,800
'Cause that happens sometimes, right?

164
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:02,920
I just want you to know...

165
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:07,600
it's okay, Dad,
you did your best.

166
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,880
Excuse me. Mr. Connor,
there's a call for you.

167
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:21,760
You can pick it up in here.

168
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:23,640
Hi, Matt.

169
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:26,880
Frank Connor.

170
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:28,840
Frank, how's it going?

171
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:31,560
- That depends, doesn't it?
- Yeah.

172
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:36,560
I've been thinking it over. Why don't
you send Matt here so I can meet him?

173
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:40,400
Meet him? What for?

174
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:43,800
Look, if it's too much trouble--

175
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:46,920
Hi, Matt.

176
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:50,560
I'm Peter McCabe.
You can call me Pete.

177
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:57,440
Let's see, you're nine.

178
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:00,200
What is that, Matt?

179
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:03,080
- Fourth grade?
- Yeah.

180
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:07,320
You like school?
I fucking hated every minute of it.

181
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:11,360
Yes, sir.

182
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:14,560
Not "sir," Matt.

183
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:20,800
You just call me Pete.
All right?

184
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:23,480
Uncle Pete.

185
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:25,960
But you're not my uncle.

186
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:35,200
- Let's do it.
- Do what, sir?

187
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:38,600
I'm going to do
the bone marrow transplant for you.

188
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:43,760
Dad, he's going to do it!

189
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:49,720
- Let me talk to your dad alone.
- Wait for me outside.

190
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:53,800
- Thank you.
- Sure.

191
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:55,240
Now...

192
00:17:56,480 --> 00:18:01,760
I will do this if, and only if,
certain things are done for me.

193
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:03,000
Name it.

194
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:06,520
You will instruct the warden
to give me back my smoking privileges.

195
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:10,680
Reinstate my access
to the prison library.

196
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:14,760
Allow me four sugars in my coffee.
And get me out of that one-man box...

197
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:17,080
and back into the general population.

198
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:18,800
I'll do everything I can.

199
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:20,240
Good, Frank.

200
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:22,920
Do everything you can.

201
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:34,160
What's on your mind?

202
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:39,720
You could have decided this
last time I was here.

203
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:45,520
I wanted to meet Matt.

204
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:48,200
This way, maybe he'd appreciate me more.

205
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:51,480
- Sounds like redemption.
- Maybe.

206
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:53,400
In a way.

207
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:58,640
Help a kid, help myself.

208
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:00,920
Who knows, right, Frank?

209
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,480
Who knows?

210
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:06,000
This is great.

211
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:09,000
I'm happy things are working out
for both of us.

212
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:11,600
Right.

213
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:21,920
Warden's never going to approve
all the stuff I want.

214
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:24,360
You're going to have to go
over his head.

215
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:32,480
At least you know I'm calling you
back again in half an hour.

216
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,440
The governor is tied up
in a trade show all day.

217
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:44,160
Frank, listen to me.

218
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:49,720
It's going to happen, all right?
It's going to happen.

219
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:55,520
What about the ventilation?

220
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:57,880
You think he can get through
the ventilation system?

221
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:02,360
Not in the new building.
But in the old building...

222
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:04,400
I'm concerned about the steam tunnels.

223
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:07,440
Shall we? Let's say hello to him.
He's right here.

224
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:10,400
- Good.
- Frank Connor, Nate Oliver.

225
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:13,840
This is Sarah Davis, Governor Walker's
assistant press secretary.

226
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:16,040
And she has some good news for us.

227
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:17,960
- What?
- Transplant's going to go down.

228
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:21,280
Congratulations, Frank.
The chief went to bat for you.

229
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:24,920
Miss Davis spoke to the governor,
and the governor spoke to the warden.

230
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:28,000
- I'm glad I could help.
- I don't know what to say. Thank you.

231
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:32,640
What you can say when the local news
interviews you...

232
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:37,120
is you'd like to thank Governor Walker
personally for what he's done.

233
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:38,200
Of course.

234
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:40,200
- Is that a deal?
- Absolutely.

235
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:46,720
Sign for these.

236
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:11,160
These cigarettes are stale.

237
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:14,720
Tell that cop and his dead kid
I won't stand for stale cigarettes.

238
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:16,200
Sign the form.

239
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:10,400
Why'd they put him in prison?

240
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:14,360
- Did he kill people?
- Yes, he killed people.

241
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:21,160
He's going to be inside of me, Dad.
He's going to be a part of me.

242
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:27,360
Definitely not. Not him.

243
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:31,000
If you get blood from an old person,
will it turn you into an old person?

244
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:35,360
If we could pick and choose,
maybe we'd take somebody else.

245
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:39,520
I know.

246
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:49,920
Come on, defense.

247
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,520
Get those hands up.

248
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:57,480
Incoming.

249
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:09,600
I know who you are, McCabe.

250
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:13,280
- I can't get you no drugs.
- I don't want any drugs. I hate drugs.

251
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:16,840
But you can get me Narcan.

252
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:19,200
It's an anti-drug.

253
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:21,280
It's a counteractive use for ODs.

254
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:26,600
And I want it in an ampule.

255
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:29,240
Not a vile, an ampule.

256
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:26,400
Who's winning?

257
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:29,600
The program's too damn easy.

258
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:31,760
Give me Kasparov.

259
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:35,600
You know what? Get me "Deep Blue."
That ought to do it.

260
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:38,520
- Finish up. Lunch in 20.
- Right, sir.

261
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:59,480
This is Ed Fayne, the prison warden.
He'll take it from here.

262
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:00,600
Welcome.

263
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:04,720
This old building was the
original hospital, constructed in 1904.

264
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:06,120
1907.

265
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:09,280
It was made into a prison ward 10 years
ago when the new hospital was built.

266
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:12,760
You did your homework. Don't let the age
of the old girl fool you.

267
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:15,240
Our security is state of the art.

268
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:17,960
This building has
two-foot thick concrete walls.

269
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:20,160
An inch of rolled steel
over every entrance.

270
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:22,920
The whole place is computer controlled.

271
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:26,560
After the procedure, we'll move McCabe
to the prison wing in a special cell.

272
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:44,040
McCabe, R45237.

273
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,520
Have prisoner secured.

274
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:08,560
We're secured at this half. Check.

275
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:26,240
Matt, this will take about an hour.
Maybe we should get started?

276
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:28,280
Make it so.

277
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:32,720
Just relax. You'll be fine.

278
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:40,360
Partner, you do your thing now, okay?

279
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:42,920
I'm with you.

280
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,840
I know, Dad.

281
00:28:57,840 --> 00:29:01,480
I love this city.
Don't you?

282
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:12,120
This procedure will greatly weaken
his immune system.

283
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:13,920
Until he gets McCabe's bone marrow...

284
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,880
I don't care how good he looks,
he's without defenses.

285
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:19,360
If he gets an infection,
it could kill him in a few hours.

286
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,240
Let them have his scent.

287
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:19,440
- Here's the paperwork.
- Right.

288
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:28,120
We've got live feeds
from three stations.

289
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:29,760
- Reporters are out front.
- Not now.

290
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:31,960
Everybody wants a statement.

291
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:35,560
How's Matt?

292
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:45,080
I'm Dr. Hawkins.
I'll be doing the extraction.

293
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:48,680
Nice to meet you. I'm sorry
I can't get up and greet you properly.

294
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:52,040
Pediatric oncologist.

295
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:56,440
- Where'd you go to medical school?
- Shut the fuck up, McCabe.

296
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:57,880
U.C.S.F.

297
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:08,280
- Do your men know where to go?
- In here until he's anesthetized.

298
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:11,840
Kellen is outside the door in pre-op,
Trimble in post-op.

299
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:15,200
- Let's get a gown on him, transfer him.
- No gown.

300
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:18,480
Unless you can put it on him
without removing the restraints.

301
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:24,240
Okay, let's get him to the table.

302
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:42,400
You're an attractive woman, Doctor.

303
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:44,800
Your competence, especially, is...

304
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:47,200
very appealing.

305
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:54,920
Excuse me.

306
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,360
I can't get to his hip
with his wrists shackled like that.

307
00:31:58,440 --> 00:32:00,560
Can't you work around them?

308
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:03,960
Mr. Cassidy, we take the extraction
from the iliac crest...

309
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,920
which is at the base of the spine.

310
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:09,360
I insert an l.V. here.
I can't operate on him chained.

311
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:15,680
Unshackle him.

312
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:55,840
You a smoker, Doc?

313
00:32:57,360 --> 00:32:59,800
Give him the Demoral right away.
Put him under.

314
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:01,880
Right.

315
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:23,760
Clear the room.

316
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:37,160
Where's my dad?

317
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,840
He'll be back.

318
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:44,400
- How you feeling?
- Sleepy.

319
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:50,880
He's breathing normally.

320
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:56,600
BIS is at 84.

321
00:33:58,560 --> 00:34:01,600
- Is he out?
- Another minute.

322
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:12,600
- Is he out?
- A moment.

323
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,360
It's not dropping.

324
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:30,000
Check the probe.

325
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:34,880
I don't understand.
He's not responding to--

326
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:19,480
The laundry chute!

327
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:28,560
- Where does it go?
- Laundry. Basement. Help me here.

328
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:35,320
He's gone down the laundry chute
to the basement. Get people there.

329
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:38,520
- How did he get out of the restraints?
- The bastard dislocated his thumbs.

330
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:43,920
Come in, Frank.

331
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:47,080
- It's me.
- What's going on?

332
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:52,200
McCabe is loose. They're evacuating
the hospital. How's Matt?

333
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:57,360
He's got a little blood in his nose.
I thought you should know about it.

334
00:37:57,440 --> 00:38:01,240
-His platelets are low. Where's Hawkins?
-I don't know. I haven't seen her.

335
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:06,800
Shit!

336
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:09,840
See if you can contact her.
I'll be there as soon as I can.

337
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:19,400
You're not going to get very far
on that leg.

338
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:21,320
Your concern is noted and appreciated.

339
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,880
I've got the blood trail again!

340
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:34,240
It starts here.

341
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:36,360
Looks like he's gone into the ER.

342
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:39,680
Go in through the ambulance bay.
I'm gonna go in through this door.

343
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:42,040
- We should both--
- Do as I say, now!

344
00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:44,480
Move!

345
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:11,120
Get Dr. Gosha down here.
We need extra help. I'll take this man.

346
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:13,240
The burn unit's swamped.

347
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:15,200
I'll take care of you myself.

348
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:17,480
I'll need another ten of morphine.

349
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:19,320
Now, nurse! Go!

350
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:32,320
I'm waiting.
I'll be right back.

351
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:36,880
What's the matter? This is an emergency
room. You're standing around. Give it--

352
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:43,120
You shouldn't let her
yell at you like that.

353
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:45,360
You'll lose your self-respect.

354
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:49,000
Now, put that in my pocket.

355
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:51,760
Atta girl.

356
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:55,440
Hold it! Let her go!

357
00:39:56,920 --> 00:39:59,440
Let her go now!

358
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:04,600
Doc, tell Frank what happens when
you take bone marrow from a dead man.

359
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:07,200
Tell him.

360
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:12,000
- Move all patients into the hallways.
- That's enough. Let her go.

361
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:14,120
Don't fuck with me
or she's dead.

362
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:15,640
Put the knife down.

363
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:19,960
I'm not afraid to die,
so I'm not afraid to kill her.

364
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:23,480
You understand that, don't you?
Tell him.

365
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:27,480
The moment he dies,
his marrow becomes ischemic.

366
00:40:27,560 --> 00:40:30,840
Without oxygen, the cells die.
It becomes useless to Matt.

367
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:34,080
You will never get out of here,
so let her go.

368
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:36,480
I'm counting to five in my head.

369
00:40:38,120 --> 00:40:42,560
Put your gun on the floor,
or your son's doctor will be dead.

370
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:46,600
Come on.
I already started counting.

371
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:55,000
I'm putting the gun down.

372
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:08,840
Talk to me.
Let's make a deal.

373
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:12,880
A deal? What kind of deal
can you give me?

374
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:16,080
Eternal life without
the possibility of parole?

375
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:20,200
Do me a favor.

376
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:23,640
Open that curtain for me.

377
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:29,200
If you even think about pulling that
trigger, I'll cut her fucking head off.

378
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:32,440
Look at me. Stay cool.

379
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:33,840
Settle down.

380
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:38,640
Kick your gun over here.
I'm starting to count in my head again.

381
00:41:38,680 --> 00:41:40,680
- One.
- I can't do that.

382
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:43,200
- Nobody is on your side except me.
- You on my side, Frank?

383
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:46,840
If you help me.
You put that knife down...

384
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:49,480
give my son a transplant,
I will go to bat for you.

385
00:41:49,560 --> 00:41:51,920
I will do everything in my power
to make your life tolerable.

386
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:55,760
-Freedom for cigarettes. There's a deal.
-You'll never get freedom.

387
00:41:55,840 --> 00:41:58,160
I have freedom right now, Frank.

388
00:41:58,240 --> 00:42:01,440
I'm freer here now
than I was yesterday. Right?

389
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:05,320
- Five!
- Here! Let her go!

390
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:06,640
Get out!

391
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:13,880
Wilson, you kill him,
you kill my son.

392
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:17,280
Wilson to Cassidy. I need backup now.
I'm in the ER, got the suspect.

393
00:42:17,360 --> 00:42:19,520
- Don't be a hero. He has nowhere to go.
- That's right.

394
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:22,680
I've got nowhere to go.

395
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:26,200
- I'm warning you--
- He's warning me.

396
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:30,200
You're warning me.
I'm warning you, you dumb fuck!

397
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:33,560
You shoot me, and I shoot her.

398
00:42:33,640 --> 00:42:35,520
And Frank goes with us.

399
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:40,000
- Who's warning who?
- Wilson, lower your gun.

400
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:42,480
You will not shoot that gun.

401
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:48,520
- Go. He won't shoot.
- You sure about that?

402
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:50,600
I'll make sure.

403
00:42:53,160 --> 00:42:56,160
- Lower your gun now.
- Frank, get out of the way.

404
00:43:10,520 --> 00:43:12,360
Appreciate what you did for me.

405
00:43:12,440 --> 00:43:14,760
If I need anything else,
I'll call you.

406
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:19,560
Stay with me.

407
00:43:22,360 --> 00:43:24,360
I need help.

408
00:43:26,600 --> 00:43:29,200
You gave up your gun.

409
00:43:30,680 --> 00:43:32,920
I need help here.

410
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:37,280
I need some pressure on it.

411
00:43:37,360 --> 00:43:39,520
Now. One, two, three.

412
00:43:39,600 --> 00:43:40,960
It's okay.

413
00:43:42,320 --> 00:43:45,720
- Bring him into the second bay.
- Check over there. Cover the doors.

414
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:47,880
What happened, Frank?

415
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:52,480
Talk to me. What happened?
Tell me!

416
00:43:54,360 --> 00:43:57,480
We had him.
Connor let him get away.

417
00:43:57,520 --> 00:44:01,040
How many people have to die tonight
so that your kid can live?

418
00:44:02,280 --> 00:44:04,840
Get me out of here
before I do anything else.

419
00:44:04,920 --> 00:44:07,160
I told you to stay out of it.

420
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:11,160
I want Connor locked up
until this is over.

421
00:44:11,240 --> 00:44:13,280
No cuffs until you pass the press!

422
00:44:15,840 --> 00:44:17,280
Sorry, Frank.

423
00:44:20,840 --> 00:44:22,520
Let's go.

424
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:32,760
Matt had blood in his nose.
I think his platelets must be low.

425
00:44:32,840 --> 00:44:34,960
I'm going to him now.

426
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:37,080
You tell him don't die.

427
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:46,880
Don't kill him.
Please don't kill him.

428
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:48,680
Get him out of here.

429
00:45:00,120 --> 00:45:03,120
- Wait a second. Where you taking me?
- To the civic center.

430
00:45:07,720 --> 00:45:11,040
Over here! It's me, Frank Connor!
I need to talk to you.

431
00:45:11,120 --> 00:45:12,960
Don't believe the police.
They're lying to you.

432
00:45:13,040 --> 00:45:15,240
McCabe escaped.
The police can't find him.

433
00:45:15,320 --> 00:45:19,120
Office Walker will talk to you,
tell you everything you need to know.

434
00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:27,000
Conner's getting away!

435
00:45:35,520 --> 00:45:37,080
What's that light?

436
00:45:38,720 --> 00:45:41,800
It's okay. It's the "Enterprise."

437
00:45:47,600 --> 00:45:49,680
- Yeah.
- It's Hawkins.

438
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:53,480
- How's he doing?
- He's bleeding more.

439
00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:55,520
Hi, Matthew.

440
00:45:55,600 --> 00:45:56,960
- Hello?
- It's Frank.

441
00:45:57,040 --> 00:45:58,920
- How's the bleeding?
- How is he?

442
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:01,480
He needs platelets
to help him control the bleeding.

443
00:46:01,560 --> 00:46:03,680
He's fine. Hawkins is here.

444
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:05,240
They arrested you.

445
00:46:05,320 --> 00:46:09,200
I escaped. Listen. You need to help me
get back into the hospital.

446
00:46:13,120 --> 00:46:14,600
Nate!

447
00:46:23,120 --> 00:46:25,120
Time to go, Doc.
I need you.

448
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:28,600
- Matt needs me here.
- I need you more.

449
00:46:28,680 --> 00:46:32,120
No, Matt, stay down.

450
00:46:32,240 --> 00:46:34,200
Why did you hit him?

451
00:46:34,280 --> 00:46:37,400
They told me what an asshole you were,
but now I know for sure.

452
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:40,840
Sometimes you don't have a choice.

453
00:46:42,240 --> 00:46:46,760
Look, I just need your doc for a minute,
and I'll send her right back.

454
00:46:46,840 --> 00:46:49,400
No, I want her to stay.

455
00:46:49,480 --> 00:46:53,080
It's going to be okay. Hold that
on your nose. Stay in the tent.

456
00:46:53,120 --> 00:46:56,520
I'll be back in a jiffy.

457
00:46:58,000 --> 00:46:59,640
Where's the cyclopropane?

458
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:07,280
It's in the storage cabinet on four.
You can take my card.

459
00:47:10,880 --> 00:47:13,840
Listen, I like you.

460
00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:19,560
I like everything about you.

461
00:47:19,640 --> 00:47:23,520
And I haven't been with a woman
since you were a virgin.

462
00:47:23,520 --> 00:47:26,800
I'm trying to be a gentleman.

463
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:29,120
I'm going to ask you again.

464
00:47:32,920 --> 00:47:35,320
Don't give me any more of that...

465
00:47:35,400 --> 00:47:40,480
"Un, duh, here, take my card. Don't
worry about the lock code bullshit."

466
00:47:43,040 --> 00:47:45,280
Or I'm going to forget my manners.

467
00:47:47,800 --> 00:47:51,520
Now, where's the cyclopropane?

468
00:47:54,040 --> 00:47:56,840
What do you say we go down there
and find it together?

469
00:47:56,920 --> 00:47:58,280
After you.

470
00:48:32,200 --> 00:48:36,280
Matt, don't touch anything.
Get inside the tent right now.

471
00:48:36,320 --> 00:48:38,560
Right now. Get back inside.

472
00:48:38,680 --> 00:48:41,800
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm all right.

473
00:48:41,880 --> 00:48:44,840
- It was McCabe.
- What?

474
00:48:44,920 --> 00:48:47,480
He took Dr. Hawkins, Dad.

475
00:48:47,520 --> 00:48:50,160
- What?
- He took Dr. Hawkins.

476
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:56,240
What's the matter?

477
00:48:56,320 --> 00:48:58,960
Nothing. Where'd he take her?

478
00:48:59,040 --> 00:49:02,080
He asked her where
the propane something was.

479
00:49:08,200 --> 00:49:12,400
Dad, something went really wrong,
didn't it?

480
00:49:15,760 --> 00:49:17,120
Yes, it did.

481
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:23,320
I'm not going to get my operation.

482
00:49:23,400 --> 00:49:26,160
Hey, give me some hands.

483
00:49:28,320 --> 00:49:33,280
Yes, you are. But I need you to get
some rest. I'll be back soon as I can.

484
00:49:40,440 --> 00:49:42,600
- Look at me. Can I go?
- Yeah.

485
00:49:42,600 --> 00:49:45,440
- Look at me. Can I go?
- Right. Go.

486
00:49:46,440 --> 00:49:49,320
- Lock this door.
- All right.

487
00:50:10,360 --> 00:50:12,920
Put that and two of those
in the bag.

488
00:50:13,040 --> 00:50:15,720
You're going to show me
where the electrical room is.

489
00:50:25,680 --> 00:50:27,720
Wait, Officer!

490
00:50:27,800 --> 00:50:30,120
Hawkins, come here.

491
00:50:31,520 --> 00:50:34,720
He's upstairs in the storage room.
4132. It's on the right.

492
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:37,080
He's got two tanks of cyclopropane,
one tank of liquid nitrogen.

493
00:50:37,160 --> 00:50:40,720
- What is he doing with it?
- He's going to the electrical room.

494
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:43,320
Wait. I think this is yours.

495
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:47,960
Doctor, please don't call the cops.

496
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:49,480
Please?

497
00:50:53,800 --> 00:50:56,120
I've got to go to the pharmacy
to get Amicar for Matt.

498
00:50:56,160 --> 00:50:57,680
Thank you.

499
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,440
Police! Hold it right there!

500
00:51:08,600 --> 00:51:11,760
This section of the hospital is locked
down. You'll have to come with us.

501
00:51:28,680 --> 00:51:30,760
Hold it right there!
Hands up!

502
00:51:30,840 --> 00:51:33,040
On your knees right now!

503
00:51:33,120 --> 00:51:36,240
What are you going to do,
shoot me, Frank?

504
00:51:36,320 --> 00:51:37,800
On your knees.

505
00:51:37,840 --> 00:51:40,280
Get on your knees.

506
00:51:43,400 --> 00:51:44,680
All right.

507
00:51:44,760 --> 00:51:49,400
Don't shoot me. I'm hit.
I'm bleeding, Frank.

508
00:51:50,280 --> 00:51:52,360
Step out!

509
00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:56,200
Step out!
Let me see your hands.

510
00:51:57,560 --> 00:52:00,640
All right, don't shoot me.

511
00:52:00,680 --> 00:52:02,240
- Step out.
- All right.

512
00:52:02,320 --> 00:52:05,480
Both hands! Both hands!

513
00:52:18,680 --> 00:52:20,520
Check the generator.

514
00:52:20,600 --> 00:52:23,160
The emergency lighting will kick in.
Don't panic.

515
00:52:30,160 --> 00:52:32,800
Nate! Nate, can you hear me?

516
00:52:32,880 --> 00:52:34,080
Nate!

517
00:52:35,640 --> 00:52:39,160
Yeah. The electricity, the ventilator,
everything is out. Where are you?

518
00:52:39,200 --> 00:52:41,240
Get Matt to a sterile environment.

519
00:52:41,320 --> 00:52:45,120
In the infectious disease lab there is
an isolation ward. No one's there.

520
00:52:45,160 --> 00:52:47,800
It's in the old building. I've seen
the plans. How do I get there?

521
00:52:47,880 --> 00:52:50,160
Via the walkway on five.

522
00:52:50,240 --> 00:52:53,800
There's a lock.
The code is 7-5-9-5.

523
00:52:53,880 --> 00:52:56,240
I'll get the Amicar
and meet you there.

524
00:52:56,320 --> 00:52:58,840
All right.
Looks like we're moving.

525
00:53:00,200 --> 00:53:02,120
7-5-9-5.

526
00:53:06,760 --> 00:53:09,120
Where's my dad?

527
00:53:09,160 --> 00:53:11,680
He's out there somewhere.
Call him on the walkie.

528
00:53:14,520 --> 00:53:16,080
Come in, Dad.

529
00:53:19,120 --> 00:53:22,280
Tell him we're moving
to the old building.

530
00:53:22,360 --> 00:53:25,680
Dad, the lights went out here.
Did they do out there, too?

531
00:53:25,760 --> 00:53:29,480
They went out here, too.
It's kind of scary, huh?

532
00:53:29,560 --> 00:53:31,400
It's not so bad.

533
00:53:31,480 --> 00:53:34,440
No, not so bad. You're right.

534
00:53:35,520 --> 00:53:36,920
Yeah?

535
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:39,080
- If I die--
- You're not going to die.

536
00:53:39,160 --> 00:53:42,360
But if I do, do you think
I'll see Mom?

537
00:53:42,400 --> 00:53:45,880
I don't know.
I don't know about that.

538
00:53:45,920 --> 00:53:49,720
I don't remember her well anymore.
Is that bad?

539
00:53:49,800 --> 00:53:53,240
No, that's not bad.
Things happen that way sometimes.

540
00:53:53,320 --> 00:53:57,040
If I die, will you forget me?

541
00:53:57,120 --> 00:53:59,720
Never. Never ever.

542
00:54:00,840 --> 00:54:02,840
I'm never going
to forget you, either, Dad.

543
00:54:02,920 --> 00:54:05,120
I have to go.

544
00:54:07,880 --> 00:54:11,200
- Nate says to tell you we're moving.
- To the infectious disease lab.

545
00:54:11,240 --> 00:54:14,280
Dad, we're going
to the infectious disease lab.

546
00:54:14,360 --> 00:54:18,080
In the old building on the sixth floor.

547
00:54:18,200 --> 00:54:20,040
We'll cross the walkway
on the fifth floor.

548
00:54:20,120 --> 00:54:22,920
We'll meet you there, okay?
Dad, are you there?

549
00:55:56,640 --> 00:55:58,880
I've got the suspect
on top of the walkway.

550
00:56:19,480 --> 00:56:21,160
- I have the suspect.
- Take him.

551
00:56:35,680 --> 00:56:37,800
Someone shot out our light.

552
00:56:49,760 --> 00:56:53,560
Negative result.
Can't find him on five or six.

553
00:56:53,600 --> 00:56:57,120
Return to the jail ward
and we'll reassemble.

554
00:56:59,840 --> 00:57:01,200
Sulfuric acid.

555
00:57:23,760 --> 00:57:25,600
Warden on the gate.

556
00:57:29,120 --> 00:57:31,800
Tell him to open up and come out
of that booth where I can see him.

557
00:57:31,880 --> 00:57:36,800
Open up the sally ports and come out
of the booth. Do whatever he says.

558
00:57:36,880 --> 00:57:39,240
He's got a hypo
of sulfuric acid at my neck.

559
00:57:42,400 --> 00:57:44,560
Face down on the floor.

560
00:57:44,640 --> 00:57:49,600
Put your fucking hands over your heads!
Get the fuck on the floor!

561
00:57:51,120 --> 00:57:52,920
- Where do I open the cells?
- There.

562
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:57,800
- No one permitted beyond this point.
- He's suffering from renal failure.

563
00:57:57,880 --> 00:58:01,040
- If he dies because you won't let me--
- There is a killer out there.

564
00:58:01,120 --> 00:58:04,840
I understand you're trying to protect
me, but it's a risk I'm willing to take.

565
00:58:04,880 --> 00:58:07,120
My patients need protection, too.

566
00:58:08,520 --> 00:58:10,920
Give me the director right away.

567
00:58:10,960 --> 00:58:14,280
If you don't get me to my patient,
he will die.

568
00:58:14,360 --> 00:58:16,520
You will be personally...

569
00:58:16,600 --> 00:58:19,000
and I might add,
publicly responsible.

570
00:58:27,440 --> 00:58:30,640
- What are you doing?
- Matthew is in there. He needs me.

571
00:58:30,720 --> 00:58:32,560
Tell me how. I'll do it.

572
00:58:32,640 --> 00:58:35,640
It's taken me more than eight years
of medical training to learn what to do.

573
00:58:35,680 --> 00:58:37,560
Do you have that long?

574
00:58:37,600 --> 00:58:40,040
Come on, let's go.

575
00:58:50,720 --> 00:58:55,120
You have a problem with heights?
This is not a good time to find out.

576
00:58:55,200 --> 00:58:58,920
I'm not just finding out.
I've always had it.

577
00:59:02,680 --> 00:59:04,480
- Give me your hand.
- Don't touch me.

578
00:59:04,560 --> 00:59:07,640
Okay, I'm not touching you.
Just stand up.

579
00:59:07,720 --> 00:59:10,640
Look at me. That's it.
Nice. Chin up.

580
00:59:10,720 --> 00:59:12,320
Okay, that's it.

581
00:59:12,400 --> 00:59:15,720
Just count. One, two.
Don't go down.

582
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:29,120
Password.

583
00:59:30,560 --> 00:59:32,800
Password!

584
00:59:32,880 --> 00:59:34,160
Firefly.

585
00:59:40,920 --> 00:59:44,160
About all I can do with it,
is run the lights and the cell doors.

586
00:59:44,240 --> 00:59:46,240
That's all you can do with it.

587
00:59:56,760 --> 01:00:00,400
-What are you doing?
-I'm locking the whole place down. Done.

588
01:00:13,560 --> 01:00:16,200
- Isn't that dangerous?
- Lay down. It's all right.

589
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:18,560
This is Peter McCabe.

590
01:00:18,640 --> 01:00:21,040
I'm in charge.

591
01:00:21,120 --> 01:00:25,600
All you bulls walking around in the tier
have got one minute...

592
01:00:25,680 --> 01:00:29,160
to get yourselves to the fifth floor
dayroom or I'll start killing...

593
01:00:29,240 --> 01:00:31,160
all your buddies.

594
01:00:32,200 --> 01:00:35,920
Fat boy up on six scratching your ass.
You hear me?

595
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:37,280
Move it!

596
01:00:41,280 --> 01:00:43,800
Shut the fuck up!

597
01:00:48,120 --> 01:00:49,960
It's good to be the king.

598
01:00:55,120 --> 01:00:59,760
Six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

599
01:00:59,840 --> 01:01:02,560
One, two, three--

600
01:01:05,760 --> 01:01:07,560
Look at me.

601
01:01:25,080 --> 01:01:26,280
It's okay.

602
01:01:32,640 --> 01:01:34,480
Get off the roof.

603
01:01:34,560 --> 01:01:38,160
Return to the new building
and get off the roof.

604
01:01:39,200 --> 01:01:42,600
- Try making another pass.
- Ten David to Air Eight.

605
01:01:42,640 --> 01:01:45,200
Try and drop him again on the roof.

606
01:02:06,640 --> 01:02:08,120
He's on the roof.

607
01:02:08,160 --> 01:02:10,680
Listen and do not speak.
I want a six-seat helicopter...

608
01:02:10,720 --> 01:02:13,600
with a range of 200 miles,
fully fueled.

609
01:02:13,720 --> 01:02:16,880
If this does not take place
within 15 minutes...

610
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:19,960
I will kill hostages
at 60-second intervals.

611
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:24,320
There won't be any more negotiations,
and don't think of trying to contact me.

612
01:02:24,400 --> 01:02:26,320
Over and out.

613
01:02:32,160 --> 01:02:34,880
Get him his chopper.

614
01:02:34,920 --> 01:02:38,320
- How soon can you get a man to--
- It will take a couple minutes.

615
01:03:03,200 --> 01:03:07,400
Go, Frank! You see that?

616
01:03:07,480 --> 01:03:09,280
There's a lesson for us.

617
01:03:09,360 --> 01:03:14,080
That man has a goal and he's determined
to achieve it no matter what.

618
01:03:27,640 --> 01:03:29,840
I was skeptical at first...

619
01:03:29,920 --> 01:03:33,400
but now I really do believe
he loves that kid.

620
01:03:54,200 --> 01:03:55,640
Sorry, Frank.

621
01:03:55,680 --> 01:03:57,920
We are in a lockdown here.

622
01:04:00,440 --> 01:04:03,160
McCabe, open this door now!

623
01:04:04,320 --> 01:04:07,040
We've got a walkie.
Call him on that.

624
01:04:12,440 --> 01:04:15,160
McCabe, Frank Connor.
Talk to me.

625
01:04:17,440 --> 01:04:19,280
Frank Connor! Talk to me!

626
01:04:20,400 --> 01:04:22,960
Frank, no one is supposed
to contact me.

627
01:04:23,040 --> 01:04:25,200
Undo his cuffs.
We're going to the roof.

628
01:04:25,240 --> 01:04:28,240
- You said 15 minutes.
- Did l? I changed my mind.

629
01:04:28,280 --> 01:04:30,480
Let's go.

630
01:04:30,520 --> 01:04:34,000
Ten David, I'm there.

631
01:04:34,080 --> 01:04:36,320
- He's not.
- Can you get a shot?

632
01:04:36,320 --> 01:04:40,240
Not from here with him there.

633
01:04:40,320 --> 01:04:44,520
Listen to me. My son needs
medical attention right away.

634
01:04:45,520 --> 01:04:48,520
Yeah, and I need a martini
and a blow job.

635
01:04:48,600 --> 01:04:50,640
We'll both have to wait.

636
01:04:50,720 --> 01:04:53,040
Son of a bitch!

637
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:55,760
Let's go!

638
01:04:55,840 --> 01:04:57,720
Stand by, here he comes.

639
01:04:57,760 --> 01:05:00,200
Matt is in your building.

640
01:05:00,240 --> 01:05:02,600
He's in the infectious disease lab.
The doctor is here.

641
01:05:02,680 --> 01:05:06,760
-Open the door. You can't possibly care!
-Cuff yourselves to that pipe.

642
01:05:08,680 --> 01:05:12,400
He can see her in 15 minutes
if your friends do as I say.

643
01:05:17,080 --> 01:05:18,720
You care about your freedom?

644
01:05:18,800 --> 01:05:21,640
It told you before.
Don't try and get inside my head.

645
01:05:22,800 --> 01:05:26,040
- I'm already in there, Peter.
- You're not behaving like a cop.

646
01:05:28,800 --> 01:05:32,160
- I'm not a cop anymore. I'm a father.
- Yeah.

647
01:05:32,280 --> 01:05:33,480
Fathers!

648
01:05:35,800 --> 01:05:37,600
What have you got for me?

649
01:05:40,120 --> 01:05:41,480
I can help you.

650
01:05:43,040 --> 01:05:45,720
Sure, you'd help me.

651
01:05:45,760 --> 01:05:47,320
I like that.

652
01:05:48,480 --> 01:05:52,040
Don't presume to know
what I'm prepared to do.

653
01:05:52,120 --> 01:05:53,800
Okay, Frank.

654
01:05:53,880 --> 01:05:55,760
What if I've done my homework
like you did yours?

655
01:05:57,280 --> 01:06:00,520
What if I know everything
that you know?

656
01:06:02,560 --> 01:06:03,920
Hold on.

657
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:05,440
Here he comes.

658
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:07,400
Duck.

659
01:06:09,440 --> 01:06:10,680
What happened?

660
01:06:16,040 --> 01:06:18,520
Just a rat, Frank.

661
01:06:18,640 --> 01:06:21,080
I just shot a rat.

662
01:06:24,960 --> 01:06:26,120
Now.

663
01:06:26,200 --> 01:06:28,120
What were you saying?

664
01:06:28,160 --> 01:06:30,800
You did your homework. Very good.
What did you learn?

665
01:06:31,920 --> 01:06:35,200
Everything you learned.
The lay of the land from top to bottom.

666
01:06:35,280 --> 01:06:37,640
Shit. Who else shares
this information?

667
01:06:40,160 --> 01:06:42,320
Just you and me...

668
01:06:42,400 --> 01:06:44,760
for now.

669
01:06:44,800 --> 01:06:47,000
And we can keep it that way
if you open this door...

670
01:06:47,040 --> 01:06:48,680
right now.

671
01:06:48,760 --> 01:06:51,360
Connor's selling us out.

672
01:06:52,600 --> 01:06:54,000
Can I trust you?

673
01:06:55,440 --> 01:06:58,440
I don't know. Can you trust me?
Did you ever trust anybody?

674
01:07:01,360 --> 01:07:03,200
Open the door, partner.

675
01:07:20,960 --> 01:07:22,920
Frank, where are you?

676
01:07:23,040 --> 01:07:27,040
If you had to, could you do the bone
marrow transplant in the isolation ward?

677
01:07:27,120 --> 01:07:30,080
- Yes. I have the anesthetic.
- You go ahead. I'll catch up.

678
01:07:37,240 --> 01:07:38,640
I'm here.

679
01:07:38,720 --> 01:07:42,680
- Appreciate my work?
- You're a lifesaver.

680
01:07:42,720 --> 01:07:44,640
We're a team now.

681
01:07:44,720 --> 01:07:48,600
We've been a team
since the day I met you.

682
01:07:48,680 --> 01:07:50,720
You begin to see that now.

683
01:07:52,880 --> 01:07:55,360
I need to see my son.

684
01:08:00,560 --> 01:08:03,840
"Thanks for the hospitality and
for putting up with a difficult guest."

685
01:08:03,920 --> 01:08:05,960
That's it. He's moving.

686
01:08:06,040 --> 01:08:07,560
So are we.

687
01:08:08,600 --> 01:08:11,280
All units, this is Vargas.
Cassidy is on his way.

688
01:08:15,240 --> 01:08:19,280
My, my! You girls need
an exercise program. Stop there.

689
01:08:28,840 --> 01:08:30,360
Atta boy.

690
01:08:32,160 --> 01:08:33,640
Take a break.

691
01:09:40,560 --> 01:09:42,720
Son of a bitch!
Cassidy!

692
01:09:42,800 --> 01:09:44,520
Cassidy, come in!

693
01:09:44,600 --> 01:09:46,480
Get off this frequency, Connor.

694
01:09:46,560 --> 01:09:48,800
Listen. Do not send your men.

695
01:09:48,880 --> 01:09:51,360
Shut the fuck up.

696
01:09:51,480 --> 01:09:53,760
- Do not send your men.
- He's giving the whole thing away.

697
01:09:53,800 --> 01:09:56,560
I lost you, Connor. Completely.

698
01:09:57,840 --> 01:09:59,680
Let's go now.

699
01:10:06,800 --> 01:10:09,440
Come on, get out of there.
Get out of there!

700
01:10:09,480 --> 01:10:12,800
Fall back.
Connor is shooting at us.

701
01:10:12,880 --> 01:10:15,400
What are you doing, Frank?

702
01:10:42,520 --> 01:10:44,320
I had them all!

703
01:10:44,400 --> 01:10:46,400
All of them at once!

704
01:10:46,480 --> 01:10:48,440
You're starting to piss me off.

705
01:10:48,480 --> 01:10:50,480
It's okay. Lie down.

706
01:10:50,520 --> 01:10:55,160
- Frank, Matt needs to see you.
- I'll be right there.

707
01:10:55,200 --> 01:10:58,080
What's going on down there?
What the hell was that?

708
01:10:58,200 --> 01:11:01,240
My official resignation.
I'll be right there.

709
01:11:01,280 --> 01:11:06,440
If Conner did this, he's helping McCabe.
He could've killed all of us.

710
01:11:06,520 --> 01:11:08,560
You know something?

711
01:11:08,640 --> 01:11:10,560
I think he just saved our lives.

712
01:11:13,560 --> 01:11:14,920
Let's go.

713
01:11:24,560 --> 01:11:26,320
Suspect is not there.

714
01:11:26,400 --> 01:11:29,560
Suspect does not appear
to be on the roof.

715
01:11:32,800 --> 01:11:35,000
Nate, open the door. It's me.

716
01:11:36,760 --> 01:11:38,840
Okay, Nate, I'm here.

717
01:11:40,720 --> 01:11:43,080
Nate, open this door.
I'm outside.

718
01:11:44,160 --> 01:11:46,040
Give me your gun, Frank.

719
01:11:49,240 --> 01:11:51,120
Give me your gun.

720
01:12:00,600 --> 01:12:02,280
Close the door!

721
01:12:06,720 --> 01:12:10,240
- This is Peter McCabe. Acknowledge.
- Frank?

722
01:12:10,320 --> 01:12:12,360
Keep the doors shut, Nate.

723
01:12:12,440 --> 01:12:17,880
Nate, I cannot be killed.
I'm immortal.

724
01:12:17,960 --> 01:12:20,760
Thanks to my kinship with Matt.

725
01:12:20,800 --> 01:12:23,560
Frank, on the other hand,
will be dead in about ten seconds...

726
01:12:23,640 --> 01:12:26,920
if you do not open
this fucking door right now!

727
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:29,800
Keep this door shut, Nate.

728
01:12:29,880 --> 01:12:31,840
Matt, no!

729
01:12:31,920 --> 01:12:34,560
- Lock the door!
- Dad!

730
01:12:35,520 --> 01:12:37,360
Come out where I can see you, Nate.

731
01:12:38,480 --> 01:12:40,800
Come on out, Nate.
Drop that gun !

732
01:12:40,880 --> 01:12:43,240
Drop it right now.

733
01:12:46,880 --> 01:12:49,640
Back into the room.
Let's go, Frank.

734
01:12:49,720 --> 01:12:51,320
It's okay.

735
01:12:55,160 --> 01:12:56,480
Let's go.

736
01:12:58,200 --> 01:13:00,200
- Get over there.
- He needs another injection.

737
01:13:01,440 --> 01:13:02,800
Come on, McCabe.

738
01:13:10,720 --> 01:13:12,440
Nice try, Doc.

739
01:13:12,480 --> 01:13:14,880
Frank, I need your help!

740
01:13:16,120 --> 01:13:19,080
The bullet shattered the hipbone.
Put pressure on the wound.

741
01:13:19,160 --> 01:13:22,320
- Where's the elevator to the morgue?
- Down the hall on the right.

742
01:13:23,280 --> 01:13:26,240
Cassidy knows about the tunnels.
I told him.

743
01:13:28,520 --> 01:13:32,400
- We had a deal. That was our secret.
- I lied.

744
01:13:32,440 --> 01:13:34,400
Really?

745
01:13:34,480 --> 01:13:38,040
Well then,
I'm going to need protection.

746
01:13:38,120 --> 01:13:39,920
Get that gun away from my son !

747
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:43,880
We can dispense with the transplant
issue. I pull the trigger, it goes away.

748
01:13:43,960 --> 01:13:46,240
You hurt my son,
I'll rip your head off!

749
01:13:47,400 --> 01:13:51,960
You want to test my resolve?
My willingness to go the limit?

750
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:56,160
Do you want to find out where you stop
and I begin? Do you?

751
01:14:00,600 --> 01:14:04,280
- Take me instead. You and me. Come on.
- No more deals.

752
01:14:31,320 --> 01:14:34,880
I wasn't really going to shoot you.
I was doing that to make a point.

753
01:14:34,960 --> 01:14:36,880
What will you do to me?

754
01:14:39,480 --> 01:14:41,120
I truly don't know.

755
01:14:41,200 --> 01:14:45,320
It doesn't matter.
I'm going to die anyway.

756
01:14:45,400 --> 01:14:47,480
Your old man doesn't think so.

757
01:14:48,360 --> 01:14:50,240
Because he can't face it.

758
01:15:03,480 --> 01:15:05,800
Frank, grab my gun!
On the floor!

759
01:15:24,600 --> 01:15:26,640
How are you feeling?

760
01:15:26,760 --> 01:15:28,760
What do you think, Einstein?

761
01:15:37,040 --> 01:15:39,800
You don't have to look at this.

762
01:15:39,880 --> 01:15:41,640
I want to.

763
01:15:46,880 --> 01:15:48,640
Come on.

764
01:16:13,880 --> 01:16:17,520
Your old man's right
about this cancer deal.

765
01:16:18,560 --> 01:16:22,520
You can't just decide
to give up and die.

766
01:16:23,640 --> 01:16:28,040
You've got to fight,
and you've got to keep on fighting.

767
01:16:28,120 --> 01:16:31,200
What for? So I can be sick
all the time?

768
01:16:31,280 --> 01:16:35,720
Stay inside,
not play with my friends?

769
01:16:35,840 --> 01:16:39,360
If I can't have any fun,
what's the point?

770
01:17:26,160 --> 01:17:30,000
Connor, get the fuck out of there!
Let us do our job!

771
01:17:39,840 --> 01:17:41,880
You wait here.

772
01:17:41,960 --> 01:17:44,680
They'll come and get you.

773
01:17:47,720 --> 01:17:49,360
I'm sorry.

774
01:17:49,440 --> 01:17:52,240
I'm sorry about the--

775
01:17:53,400 --> 01:17:56,440
Kid, if I could
have done that for you--

776
01:18:21,680 --> 01:18:25,280
- What the hell did you do that for?
- My dad's coming, and you've got a gun.

777
01:18:30,320 --> 01:18:32,600
We do have the same genes.

778
01:18:33,600 --> 01:18:35,520
No, we don't!

779
01:18:36,240 --> 01:18:37,200
Compatible.

780
01:18:38,680 --> 01:18:40,400
Definitely compatible.

781
01:18:41,600 --> 01:18:45,160
Dad, I'm in here!

782
01:18:45,240 --> 01:18:47,080
Open the door!

783
01:18:50,480 --> 01:18:52,000
- You okay?
- Yeah.

784
01:18:52,080 --> 01:18:53,600
- What?
- He went through there.

785
01:18:53,680 --> 01:18:55,600
- Which way?
- To the left.

786
01:18:55,680 --> 01:18:57,720
Go back to the elevator
and call out.

787
01:19:01,280 --> 01:19:03,280
He's tired.
You can get him.

788
01:19:16,760 --> 01:19:20,280
We'll need every car.
The sun will be up in 15 minutes.

789
01:19:20,320 --> 01:19:23,720
If we don't find him now,
he'll get lost in the rush hour traffic.

790
01:21:02,760 --> 01:21:04,280
Over here.

791
01:21:14,680 --> 01:21:16,480
What's the problem?

792
01:21:22,840 --> 01:21:25,680
Know who he is?
Here's his license.

793
01:21:25,760 --> 01:21:29,280
- I'm on the job. This man have a car?
- He had a pickup.

794
01:21:29,360 --> 01:21:32,440
Let me have that l.D.
I need to use your radio.

795
01:21:34,840 --> 01:21:36,400
That's my car!

796
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:50,080
Assault suspect possibly driving
'89 blue Ford pickup...

797
01:21:50,160 --> 01:21:54,040
California license plate,
3-Henry-6-0-6-Zebra-3.

798
01:22:01,440 --> 01:22:03,400
A minute of sleep

799
01:22:03,440 --> 01:22:07,160
Worrying about the way things
might have been

800
01:22:07,200 --> 01:22:10,840
Big wheel keep on turning

801
01:22:10,920 --> 01:22:15,280
Proud Mary keep on burning
Rolling

802
01:22:24,800 --> 01:22:26,360
5-Boy-22.

803
01:22:26,400 --> 01:22:29,520
I have the blue '89 Ford pickup
eastbound on Van Ness.

804
01:22:29,560 --> 01:22:32,200
Twenty-two, are you following
the vehicle? Come in.

805
01:22:32,280 --> 01:22:34,280
Twenty-two,
are you following the vehicle?

806
01:22:34,360 --> 01:22:36,240
Negative.
Now southbound on 101.

807
01:23:02,400 --> 01:23:04,120
Come on, come on.

808
01:23:10,240 --> 01:23:14,400
5-Boy-22, you said you had a blue Ford
pickup going south on the 101?

809
01:23:14,480 --> 01:23:17,560
- Negative. I said northbound, didn't l?
- Shit, five miles.

810
01:24:30,080 --> 01:24:34,360
S. F.P.D. What are you doing
in the East Bay, Officer?

811
01:24:42,320 --> 01:24:45,600
- This is 5-Boy-22.
- Go ahead.

812
01:24:45,640 --> 01:24:49,320
I need to speak to the bridge operator
at the Kakawanis Straits Bridge now.

813
01:24:49,400 --> 01:24:50,960
That must go through the office.

814
01:24:52,320 --> 01:24:55,320
This is Captain Cassidy speaking.
I have an emergency situation.

815
01:24:55,400 --> 01:24:58,600
I need to speak directly
to the bridge operator now!

816
01:25:04,720 --> 01:25:06,560
Get the fuck off me, Frank.

817
01:25:08,360 --> 01:25:10,360
When do you want it?

818
01:25:10,480 --> 01:25:12,760
In a couple of minutes.
I'll let you know.

819
01:26:01,280 --> 01:26:02,680
Shit!

820
01:26:03,800 --> 01:26:06,520
Okay. He's 45 seconds away.
Hit the bars when you see him.

821
01:26:07,760 --> 01:26:11,200
Somebody's giving orders to
the Bridge Authority using your name.

822
01:26:11,280 --> 01:26:13,280
Copy. Let's take a look.

823
01:26:29,480 --> 01:26:31,240
Raise it.

824
01:27:25,360 --> 01:27:28,520
That's close enough, Frank.
Nice little trick.

825
01:27:28,600 --> 01:27:30,320
You're persistent.

826
01:27:30,400 --> 01:27:32,280
I'm motivated.

827
01:27:32,360 --> 01:27:36,280
- You got any other deals for me?
- Redemption?

828
01:27:36,360 --> 01:27:39,400
If you can't eat it, drink it,
fuck it or fire it, I ain't interested.

829
01:27:39,440 --> 01:27:41,280
You're coming back with me
just the same.

830
01:27:43,520 --> 01:27:48,000
I don't think so.
You got friends coming.

831
01:27:52,160 --> 01:27:53,800
It's McCabe and--

832
01:27:53,880 --> 01:27:55,760
Connor! Don't shoot yet!

833
01:28:08,320 --> 01:28:10,520
- I'm sorry.
- Hold your fire!

834
01:28:10,560 --> 01:28:12,640
Don't move. Stay protected.

835
01:28:12,720 --> 01:28:16,800
If I stay, I end up back in that box.
That is not acceptable.

836
01:28:16,880 --> 01:28:19,200
We're losing oil pressure.
We've got to land.

837
01:28:19,280 --> 01:28:21,240
Best of luck.

838
01:28:59,560 --> 01:29:01,480
Frank, I'm going.

839
01:29:01,560 --> 01:29:03,440
No, you're not!

840
01:29:04,800 --> 01:29:09,440
- Let me give you a hand.
- Get the gurney. Move it!

841
01:29:09,520 --> 01:29:13,560
- Frank, you'll answer for this.
- Whatever. I'm going with him. Move!

842
01:29:14,920 --> 01:29:17,560
Let's go. Get him in.

843
01:29:17,600 --> 01:29:19,680
Inside right now!
I gotta keep him alive.

844
01:29:19,760 --> 01:29:21,600
Get out of here.

845
01:29:28,840 --> 01:29:30,320
What?

846
01:29:30,400 --> 01:29:34,600
- I don't think I can--
- Yes, you can and you will.

847
01:29:34,680 --> 01:29:37,680
You're going to live
as long as it takes.

848
01:29:37,760 --> 01:29:41,280
Tell me I'm right.
Am I right, Pete?

849
01:29:41,360 --> 01:29:42,920
Tell me, Pete.

850
01:29:53,600 --> 01:29:57,600
Guys, we got a saturated mess in here.
How much more do you need?

851
01:29:58,640 --> 01:30:00,560
How many cc's do you have?

852
01:30:00,640 --> 01:30:02,520
We have 220.

853
01:30:13,920 --> 01:30:15,800
We've got enough.

854
01:30:15,840 --> 01:30:18,200
Pete, you did it.

855
01:31:07,080 --> 01:31:08,480
It's going well.

856
01:31:48,320 --> 01:31:50,160
He going to make it?

857
01:31:50,240 --> 01:31:51,720
He's stable.

858
01:31:55,200 --> 01:31:56,600
Guard?

859
01:31:57,760 --> 01:31:59,160
What?

860
01:31:59,200 --> 01:32:01,160
He needs to rest.

861
01:32:06,720 --> 01:32:08,280
What?

862
01:32:15,680 --> 01:32:18,040
- How's the little boy?
- What?

863
01:32:18,080 --> 01:32:20,440
How's Matthew Connor?

864
01:32:20,480 --> 01:32:22,400
I hear he's doing good.

865
01:32:22,440 --> 01:32:24,800
His body seems to be accepting
the transplant.

866
01:32:24,880 --> 01:32:26,840
They're happy up there.

867
01:32:27,840 --> 01:32:29,520
Good.

868
01:32:31,040 --> 01:32:33,600
I guess I can go now.

869
01:32:33,680 --> 01:32:36,880
You're a tough bastard, McCabe.
You'll make it.

870
01:32:43,800 --> 01:32:46,560
What kind of car do you have?
