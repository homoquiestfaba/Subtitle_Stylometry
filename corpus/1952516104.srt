00:00:05,350 --> 00:00:08,070
<i>***One-piece swimsuit</i>

3
00:00:08,070 --> 00:00:09,760
<i>On a beach in boston,</i>

4
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:13,000
<i>Instead of the cumbersome
dress and pantaloon combination</i>

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,370
<i>That was popular for women at the time.</i>

6
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:18,810
<i>She was arrested for indecency.</i>

7
00:00:21,770 --> 00:00:23,220
<i>As someone who has always been known</i>

8
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:26,410
<i>To make daring fashion choices,I
see a lot of myself in her.</i>

9
00:00:26,410 --> 00:00:28,800
So what ms. Kellerman designed was

10
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:31,480
the precursor To all modern swimsuits.

11
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:34,410
So not only would she be a
fascinating feature subject,

12
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:36,630
But we could do a whole
accompanying photo spread--

13
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:38,900
A hundred years of swimwear.

14
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:40,240
And...

15
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:42,100
I got the suit.

16
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:43,900
Unitards don't really scream sexy.

17
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:45,350
More like,um...

18
00:00:45,350 --> 00:00:47,620
1970s magician.

19
00:00:47,620 --> 00:00:49,500
That's the first smart thing you've said

20
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:52,030
Since half the staff had
to rescue you from a cult.

21
00:00:52,030 --> 00:00:53,340
Snap!

22
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:55,550
I'm sorry. We'll be
keeping that a secret.

23
00:00:55,900 --> 00:00:58,550
Betty,write the feature.
No photos,please.

24
00:00:58,550 --> 00:01:02,070
And since we are on the
subject of the swimsuit spread,

25
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:04,220
Everyone knows we're
shooting in the bahamas.

26
00:01:04,220 --> 00:01:07,040
That is essential employees only.

27
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:09,160
Matt hartley will be
drawing up the list.

28
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:11,310
So stop sending me tacky flowers,

29
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:13,280
And do your sucking up to him.

30
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:15,170
I am fine with tacky flowers.

31
00:01:15,170 --> 00:01:16,780
Or,uh,better yet,cupcakes.

32
00:01:16,780 --> 00:01:18,690
Basically,I can be bought.

33
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:22,340
That's all.

34
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:26,440
This will be my last shoot at "mode.

35
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:28,790
" I've told you many times before

36
00:01:28,790 --> 00:01:33,120
That people will die at my
hands if things are not perfect.

37
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:35,970
And this time,I ain't playin'.

38
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:37,550
She ain't playin'!

39
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:42,020
Oh,that was fun.

40
00:01:42,020 --> 00:01:45,610
Scaring the minions
for sport one last time.

41
00:01:45,610 --> 00:01:47,470
It's not for sport,marc. I'm serious.

42
00:01:47,470 --> 00:01:48,670
Oh,okay.

43
00:01:48,670 --> 00:01:51,220
I thought you just Might want
to take it easy in the bahamas,

44
00:01:51,220 --> 00:01:53,890
What,with the connor and nico fallout.

45
00:01:53,890 --> 00:01:57,870
Fallout? My daughter betrayed
me,the love of my life died.

46
00:01:57,870 --> 00:01:59,940
All things considered,a bad day.

47
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:01,680
Oh,I'm sorry,willie. If
you want to talk about it--

48
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,690
do I look like a girl?

49
00:02:03,690 --> 00:02:05,640
Now is not the time to take things easy.

50
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:07,290
You're only as good as your last shoot.

51
00:02:07,690 --> 00:02:09,650
the magazine business is shrinking.

52
00:02:09,650 --> 00:02:10,980
And I am not cheap.

53
00:02:10,980 --> 00:02:14,420
Ugh,one of the only "c"
words in the english language

54
00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:16,170
Never used to describe you.

55
00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:17,690
The other's "cuddly.

56
00:02:17,690 --> 00:02:20,000
" Well,fortunately,the
editor-in-chief Of "isabella"

57
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,350
is stepping down Due to
life-threatening health issues.

58
00:02:23,350 --> 00:02:24,750
And I have it on good authority

59
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:27,700
That the job is between
me and penelope graybridge.

60
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:29,360
Penelope graybridge?
Oh,I've heard of her.

61
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:32,960
She's beautiful and unstoppable.

62
00:02:33,970 --> 00:02:35,430
and she's a junkie.

63
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:37,240
well,try to get her picture on

64
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:40,010
one of those "I lost
me to meth" billboards.

65
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:42,530
This job is my only option.

66
00:02:44,090 --> 00:02:46,390
I didn't really mean it when
I told people to bribe me.

67
00:02:46,390 --> 00:02:48,120
Didn't you,a little bit?

68
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:49,350
Well,maybe a little bit.

69
00:02:49,350 --> 00:02:52,180
But with one spot left,I thought
I'd get some better stuff.

70
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:54,410
This is just stolen office supplies.

71
00:02:54,410 --> 00:02:55,830
Hey,that's my stapler.

72
00:02:56,030 --> 00:02:57,850
Not anymore.

73
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:00,410
I'll trade you.

74
00:03:00,410 --> 00:03:02,630
Oh,my god. You,too?

75
00:03:02,630 --> 00:03:04,080
It's not a bribe.

76
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:06,390
I mean,yes,I would love
to go to the bahamas.

77
00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:08,710
But I'm not essential to the shoot.

78
00:03:08,710 --> 00:03:10,330
This is just a thank-you gift

79
00:03:10,330 --> 00:03:13,320
For helping me get
daniel out of the cult.

80
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:14,900
You're a good friend.

81
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:19,490
So we're really friends?

82
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:23,090
Yeah. I think we're friends. Don't you?

83
00:03:23,090 --> 00:03:25,720
Yeah,definitely. Friends. Great.

84
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:29,860
I've gotta get back to
work. Thanks for the pail.

85
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:32,170
Yeah. Thanks for the stapler.

86
00:03:36,970 --> 00:03:40,820
<i>bus driver... Move that bus!</i>

87
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:43,240
justin,you gotta come in here.

88
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:45,060
They just gave these
people their new house,

89
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:48,540
And there's,like,18 people
shaking uncontrollably.

90
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:50,670
Hey,bobby. What are you doing here?

91
00:03:50,670 --> 00:03:52,620
I just came to get some water,you know?

92
00:03:53,020 --> 00:03:55,300
Oh,no,no,not this show,hilda.

93
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:57,900
This makes me cry like
a baby. Turn it off.

94
00:03:58,370 --> 00:04:00,590
You know,chicks kinda
dig it when you cry,right?

95
00:04:02,090 --> 00:04:04,610
Hey,don't call girls
chicks. You hear me?

96
00:04:04,610 --> 00:04:06,920
All right. I'm gonna go do my homework.

97
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:10,890
So why did you drive justin home?

98
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:12,720
Ah,high school can be rough,you know?

99
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14,960
I just want to make sure
nobody bothers the kid.

100
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:16,520
Not on my watch.

101
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:18,590
see?

102
00:04:18,590 --> 00:04:19,860
Try to act all tough guy,

103
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:23,960
But I've always known there's
a big softy under there.

104
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:28,790
Ooh. Bicep. It's not so soft.

105
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:34,320
All right. I got my water. I'm gonna go.

106
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:35,580
Okay.

107
00:04:38,330 --> 00:04:39,720
Okay.

108
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:41,170
Come back if you get...

109
00:04:41,170 --> 00:04:44,140
Thirsty again.

110
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:51,720
<i>you're a good friend. Betty</i>

111
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:54,620
I left something out of your gift.

112
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:56,430
It's all of your favorite colors.

113
00:04:56,430 --> 00:04:58,210
Wait. Where's betty's stapler?

114
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:02,070
Okay,you can use that
bikini but not that model.

115
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:06,440
You know what? You came
in at the perfect time.

116
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:08,110
I'm just finishing my
list for the bahamas,

117
00:05:08,110 --> 00:05:10,030
And I've got one spot left.

118
00:05:10,030 --> 00:05:11,640
- How'd you like
to go? - But--

119
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:13,770
You can be an associate
stylist for the shoot.

120
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:17,410
oh,my god. Oh,my god.
A promotion! Thank you.

121
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:22,540
okay,but... I have to ask
you,is this just a work thing?

122
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:25,060
'cause you're kinda big
on the mixed signals.

123
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:27,270
I know. I'm sorry.

124
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:29,720
Look,I have a great
time when we're together.

125
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:32,750
But sometimes it's hard
to think about you and me

126
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:34,740
When other people are around.

127
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:38,460
So it might be nice to get
together away from other people.

128
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:40,160
I totally agree.

129
00:05:41,950 --> 00:05:43,870
we're talking about betty,right?

133
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:02,720
Amanda's going to the bahamas?

134
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:07,920
I wonder what she's gonna do there.

135
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:10,410
I guess she could not
answer the phones at atlantis

136
00:06:10,410 --> 00:06:12,450
As well as she doesn't answer them here.

137
00:06:12,450 --> 00:06:14,400
Did you not notice how
I hunched my shoulders

138
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,680
And averted my gaze
upward when you approached?

139
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:19,840
Learn how to recognize social cues.

140

141
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:31,510
Co-worker coffee,Not "I want
to sleep with you" coffee.

142
00:06:31,510 --> 00:06:33,180
Subtle.

143
00:06:33,970 --> 00:06:35,900
Okay. That was weird.

144
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:37,530
is something going on between them?

145
00:06:37,530 --> 00:06:39,370
Here's another social cue.

146
00:06:39,370 --> 00:06:42,170
That means,"I'm not
going to talk to you.

147
00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:44,210
" Marc,you know something.

148
00:06:44,210 --> 00:06:45,260
And you might as well just tell me,

149
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:47,790
Or I'll just chase you out of the
elevator And through the streets.

150
00:06:48,270 --> 00:06:51,630
okay,fine. But only because you have
sturdy legs And I'm in heels today.

151
00:06:51,630 --> 00:06:54,510
I will tell you one
thing and one thing only.

152
00:06:56,710 --> 00:07:00,620
Amanda has wanted to
tap matt for a while now.

153
00:07:01,430 --> 00:07:03,230
and they went on a date recently.

154
00:07:03,230 --> 00:07:05,120
And they're probably gonna
hook up in the bahamas.

155

Yo. Language.

Grab a fistful of that skank's
hair And take back my man.

00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:07,530
That is exactly what we could use To...

176
00:08:08,030 --> 00:08:09,850
Get the juices flowin'.

177
00:08:09,850 --> 00:08:11,550
Okay,that I don't need to hear.

178
00:08:11,550 --> 00:08:13,590
I can get you the "mode" rate
if you want. You'd love it.

179
00:08:13,590 --> 00:08:15,560
They're putting everyone
up at the cove atlantis.

180
00:08:16,470 --> 00:08:18,160
Oh,my god. You have to go.

181
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:20,320
- Shakira's gonna be there this week.
- I love her.

182
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:22,420
She goes under the name sidney lumpkin,

183
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:26,160
And I need you to get
this signed for me.

184
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,830
- "my life with shakira.
- yeah.

185
00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:29,310
is that cute?

186
00:08:29,310 --> 00:08:31,340
You got married!

187
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:36,490
My photoshopped life is so
much better than my real one.

188
00:08:36,490 --> 00:08:38,260
So cute.

189
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:40,140
I'm not going to the bahamas.

190
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:48,660
Is it just my imagination
Or is everyone around me

191
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:50,100
pointing and whispering?

192
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:52,790
Oh,don't worry. They'll
stop once it grows back out.

193
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:55,220
I was talking about the cult,but thanks.

194
00:08:55,220 --> 00:08:57,540
- Now I know how you feel about my haircut.
- Sorry.

195
00:08:57,540 --> 00:09:00,250
I should probably just lay low
Until this whole thing blows over.

196
00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:01,660
Oh,come on,daniel. Who cares?

197
00:09:01,660 --> 00:09:03,080
You're about to go to the bahamas.

198
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:04,680
Given everything you've
just been through,

199
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:06,550
I think you should
do the exact opposite.

200
00:09:06,550 --> 00:09:09,520
Get out there. Try and
be your old self again.

201
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:12,760
But wait. You used to be pretty
judgmental of my old self.

202
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:15,580
Wait. In fact,you're the one
who coined the term "man slut.

203
00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:18,780
" oh,come on. People were calling
you "man slut" way before me.

204
00:09:18,780 --> 00:09:20,090
And you know what?

205
00:09:20,090 --> 00:09:22,650
Being a little man slutty
might be therapeutic.

206
00:09:27,140 --> 00:09:28,700
I feel stupidly old-fashioned,

207
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:31,100
But I just can't do the
collars the way you do.

208
00:09:31,490 --> 00:09:32,630
Thank you.

209
00:09:32,630 --> 00:09:34,660
Now get me my beer,woman.

210
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:40,030
- You are gonna more than
thank me in a second. - Wh--

211
00:09:40,030 --> 00:09:42,760
- I got a surprise for you.
- Okay. Now?

212
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:44,990
I mean,I-I just showered,but,uh,yeah.

213
00:09:45,030 --> 00:09:47,110
no,not that.

214
00:09:47,470 --> 00:09:48,540
Here!

215
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:50,140
Atlantis? Paradise island?

216
00:09:50,140 --> 00:09:52,570
Yes! Betty can get us a discount.

217
00:09:52,570 --> 00:09:54,970
Justin is gone with
friends for the weekend.

218
00:09:54,970 --> 00:09:58,500
So I figured it would be a good
way for us to, You know,reconnect.

219
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:02,050
Oh,hilda,I can't. I have a strategizing
meeting upstate this weekend.

220
00:10:02,050 --> 00:10:04,630
And it might look bad
to voters,too,you know,

221
00:10:04,630 --> 00:10:06,980
Taking a vacation in this economy?

222
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:09,090
It's not a vacation.

223
00:10:09,090 --> 00:10:11,470
It's two days.

224
00:10:11,470 --> 00:10:14,360
Oh,come on. You know
I would go if I could.

225
00:10:14,570 --> 00:10:17,410
But at least now,you won't have to
deal with All my weird germ issues,

226
00:10:17,410 --> 00:10:19,980
Like not being able to touch
a hotel bedspread,right?

227
00:10:20,770 --> 00:10:21,910
right?

228
00:10:21,910 --> 00:10:23,370
Yeah,okay.

229
00:10:23,370 --> 00:10:25,140
Do what you need to do.

230
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:27,220
All right. I'll see you later,all right?

231
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:37,870
oh. Oh,hey,matt.

232
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:39,900
Which heels go better
with my bikini--

233
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:42,200
These or these?

234
00:10:42,710 --> 00:10:43,890
I like those.

235
00:10:46,050 --> 00:10:49,070
you're not gonna wear
that on the plane,Are you?

236
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:51,970
You're right. I'll freeze.

237
00:10:53,030 --> 00:10:54,560
Do you have my messages?

238
00:10:58,230 --> 00:10:59,320
That's great.

239
00:11:05,810 --> 00:11:06,920
It's the same thing.

240
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:10,710
Be sure to pack the
portfolios in my carry-on.

241
00:11:10,710 --> 00:11:12,270
I want us to work on the flight.

242
00:11:12,270 --> 00:11:13,780
wouldn't want any downtime.

243
00:11:13,780 --> 00:11:15,200
And do not pack your bathing suit.

244
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:17,040
I don't want any temptation to relax.

245
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:18,110
God forbid.

246
00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:19,720
What is up with the muttering?

247
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:21,910
Why do you seem dissatisfied serving me?

248
00:11:21,910 --> 00:11:25,140
it's not fair,willie. Everyone else is
gonna be there having fun except for us.

249
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:28,110
And what's the point? We don't
even have jobs to come back to.

250
00:11:28,110 --> 00:11:30,360
Marc,I will get that
position at "isabella,"

251
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:33,310
And as usual,you will be my
assistant. Think positive.

252
00:11:33,310 --> 00:11:35,960
I am. I am positive I need a vacation.

253
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:39,010
Oh,I meant to mutter that.

254
00:11:42,470 --> 00:11:43,940
Congratulations,betty.

255
00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:45,200
You're going on a trip.

256
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:47,100
And this time,you won't
be hidden in a wheel.

257
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:49,010
You're working for me in the bahamas.

258
00:11:50,190 --> 00:11:51,560
Muttery,you just got a vacation.

259
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:54,740
Oh,um,actually,I-I
don't think I can--

260
00:11:54,740 --> 00:11:56,630
Leave with tomorrow's group.

261
00:12:01,130 --> 00:12:02,640
I can see myself in your glasses.

262
00:12:04,570 --> 00:12:05,940
So,uh...

263
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:09,100
Yeah.

264
00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:30,650
Hold on.

265
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:33,200
Excuse me.

266
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:35,930
Shh. Please don't say
anything,'cause nobody knows I'm here.

267
00:13:35,930 --> 00:13:37,270
I got it.

268
00:13:38,270 --> 00:13:40,530
I love you so much.

269
00:13:40,530 --> 00:13:42,070
Thank you.

270
00:13:43,850 --> 00:13:45,870
oh,my god! I just ran into shakira.

271
00:13:45,870 --> 00:13:49,160
Shakira! I'm jealous. Love you. Bye.

272
00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:53,070
{a6}<i>don't***</i>

273
00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:52,760
I'm freezing to death,papi.

274
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:55,230
Please,if you loved
me,you'd let me be warm.

275
00:13:57,610 --> 00:14:00,410
Oh,no,no,no,no! No,no.

276
00:14:03,740 --> 00:14:04,740
Bobby?

277
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:06,190
Hey,this-- this was
on the floor of my car.

278
00:14:06,190 --> 00:14:07,560
Justin must have left it,you know?

279
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:09,370
Whatever. Come in. I
can't talk right now.

280
00:14:09,370 --> 00:14:10,800
The knob broke off.

281
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:13,100
I tried to turn it up 'cause
it's like alaska in here,

282
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:14,360
But of course it broke.

283
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:16,080
- Look.
- Look at this.

284
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:18,030
Look,let me take a look at it.

285
00:14:18,380 --> 00:14:19,630
This is the worst weekend of my life.

286
00:14:19,630 --> 00:14:20,940
I should be in the bahamas right now.

287
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:23,700
But,no,my boyfriend has
to,like,strategize or something.

288
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:25,440
And miss you in a bikini? That's...

289
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:27,540
That's a bad call.

290
00:14:28,340 --> 00:14:30,790
All right. Come on. Paper towels?

291
00:14:30,790 --> 00:14:32,590
All right,all right.
You know what to do?

292
00:14:32,590 --> 00:14:34,290
You kidding me? I've
done this a million times.

293
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:35,980
All right. You just gotta
turn this little thing--

294
00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:38,000
Damn!

295
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,410
Why'd you turn that up so high?

296
00:14:45,030 --> 00:14:47,310
everybody,light it up,go,rihanna ?

297
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:04,410
Ooh,a bikini. How fresh.

298
00:15:04,410 --> 00:15:06,960
We'll set the fashion
world on fire with this.

299
00:15:07,930 --> 00:15:09,400
And this one doesn't
know what it wants to be.

300
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:11,410
It's the anne heche of swimwear.

301
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:12,520
Get rid of all of them.

302
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:14,070
I want new options.

303
00:15:14,070 --> 00:15:15,850
Has one thing gone right today?

304
00:15:15,850 --> 00:15:17,730
Ou found a wrangler for the models.

305
00:15:17,730 --> 00:15:19,760
And they're terrified of her.

306
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:25,010
,The locals say she caught
a shark with her bare hands.

307
00:15:25,010 --> 00:15:26,900
<i>breaking news! Fashion alert!</i>

308
00:15:29,070 --> 00:15:31,230

- Hi,amanda.

319
00:16:08,230 --> 00:16:09,840
Wilhelmina asked me to come.

320
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:11,480
You seem alarmed to see me.

321
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:12,790
No,I don't.

322
00:16:17,190 --> 00:16:18,190
Really?

323
00:16:18,530 --> 00:16:20,950
Are you sure? Because
I'm giving you the chance

324
00:16:20,950 --> 00:16:23,260
To be upfront about whether or not

325
00:16:23,260 --> 00:16:28,070
You might be dating a
certain guy That we both know.

326
00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:32,400
We're talking about matt,right?

327
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:33,750
Yes.

328
00:16:34,430 --> 00:16:37,080
Amanda. Amanda,come on.

329
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:39,210
Let's just talk about this.

330
00:16:45,710 --> 00:16:46,960
this is the only empty stool.

331
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:49,510
I know we're not exactly
friends,So we don't have to talk.

332
00:16:49,510 --> 00:16:51,110
Hi. Drink.

333
00:16:55,540 --> 00:16:58,980
Is it so much to ask For a
little meaningless vacation sex?

334
00:16:58,980 --> 00:17:00,520
But little
known fact--

335
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:02,260
There are no gay people in the bahamas.

336
00:17:02,260 --> 00:17:06,100
I have scoured the gym,the
spa,the private beach.

337
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:09,450
Not a waxed chest Or a
condescending attitude to be found.

338
00:17:09,970 --> 00:17:11,940
What about those two guys right there?

339
00:17:11,940 --> 00:17:13,760
Totally gay.

340
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:17,690
European. Rookie mistake.

341
00:17:17,690 --> 00:17:20,040
This is the worst gaycation ever.

342
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:21,520
Can I ask you a question?

343
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:23,430
Du you add the word
"gay" to any regular word

344
00:17:23,430 --> 00:17:24,930
Just to kinda make it your own?

345
00:17:24,930 --> 00:17:26,820
Gaybe. Gaybe not.

346
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:30,900
well,if it's any consolation,

347
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:32,520
I'm kinda trying to meet someone,too,

348
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:34,540
But apparently,I've forgotten how.

349
00:17:34,540 --> 00:17:36,670
Well,this is your lucky gay.

350
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:39,320
okay. I'll stop that now.

351
00:17:39,790 --> 00:17:41,170
but seriously,I can help y,u.

352
00:17:41,170 --> 00:17:45,280
Girlselove it when a straighty
is down with the pink team.

353
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,590
Who-- who do you
have your eye on?

354
00:17:48,130 --> 00:17:49,750
this girl over here.

355
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:54,090
Excuse me,pretty lady.

356
00:17:54,090 --> 00:17:57,180
My straight friend here is
trying to set me up with guys.

357
00:17:57,180 --> 00:17:58,460
How's that going?

358
00:17:58,460 --> 00:18:03,150
Uh... Not so well.
I could use your help.

359
00:18:03,150 --> 00:18:05,970
Okay. What about those two?

360
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:08,750
They're european.

361
00:18:09,530 --> 00:18:12,640
<i>I'm g yo this gain't easy.</i>

362
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:14,720
I'll let you slide for that one.

363
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:16,930
- I'm susannah.
- Daniel.

364
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:22,290
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

365
00:18:24,030 --> 00:18:26,090
- amanda,I want to talk about this.
- I don't.

366
00:18:26,090 --> 00:18:27,950
Why didn't you just tell me
that you were dating matt?

367
00:18:27,950 --> 00:18:29,580
Because I knew you
would get all vulnerable

368
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:31,000
And push your glasses up your nose

369
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,490
And make me feel bad that I like him.

370
00:18:32,490 --> 00:18:33,670
Well,you should feel bad.

371
00:18:33,670 --> 00:18:35,590
What if I still have feelings for him?

372
00:18:35,590 --> 00:18:37,510
Well,what if I have
feelings for him,too?

373
00:18:37,510 --> 00:18:39,640
Why do your feelings count
more than my feelings?

374
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:41,130
Because I was dating him first.

375
00:18:41,130 --> 00:18:43,180
Isn't there,like,a girl code about that?

376
00:18:43,180 --> 00:18:44,840
Not for pretty girls.

377
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:47,960
And you only got interested in him
again When I started liking him.

378
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:49,990
No,that is not true.

379
00:18:49,990 --> 00:18:52,090
I've been trying to figure
out how I feel about matt,

380
00:18:52,090 --> 00:18:55,020
But it's hard to do when someone
else Is already all up in his pants.

381
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:56,860
Said it.

382
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:00,750
I'll race you for him.

383
00:19:05,540 --> 00:19:07,900
Um... But I'm--
I'm fully clothed.

384
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:09,320
So am I.

385
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:10,580
We're not children.

386
00:19:10,580 --> 00:19:12,330
Then I guess I win.

387
00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:48,080
Oh,god. Yes!

388
00:19:48,490 --> 00:19:52,180
Whoo-hoo! In your face! I win!

389
00:19:53,090 --> 00:19:55,730
Oh,come on,amanda. Don't be like that.

390
00:19:55,730 --> 00:19:58,640
You'll find anothellmillionaire
to date in five minutes.

391
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:04,540
Is that really what you
think this is for me?

392
00:20:05,210 --> 00:20:06,600
Betty,did it ever occur to you

393
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:09,580
That I might actually have
real feelings for matt?

394
00:20:10,470 --> 00:20:11,810
No...

395
00:20:11,810 --> 00:20:14,100
Because you're only
thinking about what you want.

396
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:16,690
And what is that? One
minute,you want to be his friend,

397
00:20:16,690 --> 00:20:18,860
And the next minute,you want him back?

398
00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:21,700
What about what matt wants?

399
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:25,890
He invited me.

400
00:20:25,890 --> 00:20:27,470
betty?

401
00:20:29,190 --> 00:20:31,560
Betty,what are you doing here?

402
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:37,470
Helping wilhelmina,Which I
should probably get back to.

403
00:20:38,050 --> 00:20:41,560
But,uh... This is good.

404
00:20:43,550 --> 00:20:45,420
I'm fine wit. It.

405
00:20:47,930 --> 00:20:49,630
So all hell has broken loose,

406
00:20:49,630 --> 00:20:51,850
And no one can find
wilhelmina to deal with it.

407
00:20:51,850 --> 00:20:53,940
Which should worry me, Because
the only way wilhelmina slater

408
00:20:53,940 --> 00:20:55,210
Would disappear from a shoot

409
00:20:55,210 --> 00:20:58,120
Is at the hands of bin
laden or anna wintour.

410
00:20:58,120 --> 00:20:59,460
But I'm on my first
vacation in five years--

411
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:01,020
okay,marc. I can deal with it.

412
00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:02,310
I just hadhey heart crushed.

413
00:21:02,310 --> 00:21:04,310
I t I can push that aside And
pretend like it never happened.

414
00:21:04,310 --> 00:21:05,560
That'd be great.

415
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:32,370
* oh,baby *

416
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:38,080
* oh,baby * * keep on *

417
00:21:39,730 --> 00:21:42,230

* you got it together,keep on doing it *

421
00:21:54,010 --> 00:21:56,520
* I'm never,never gonna give you up *

422
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:59,190
* I'm never,ever gonna stop *

423
00:21:59,190 --> 00:22:01,910
* stop the way I feel about you *

424
00:22:01,910 --> 00:22:04,340
* girl,I just can't live without you *

425
00:22:05,010 --> 00:22:08,100
I hate to admit it,but
I rather enjoyed that.

426
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:09,810
You let me think you died.

427
00:22:09,810 --> 00:22:12,250
You believed that? Oh,I'm so sorry.

428
00:22:12,830 --> 00:22:14,150
I'm over it.

429
00:22:17,780 --> 00:22:20,350
* I'll see you through it *

430
00:22:20,350 --> 00:22:23,530
* I'm never,never gonna give you up *

431
00:22:23,530 --> 00:22:26,450
* I'm never,ever gonna stop *

432
00:22:26,450 --> 00:22:28,950
* stop the way I feel about you *

433
00:22:28,950 --> 00:22:32,100
* girl,I just can't live without you *

434
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:34,980
* I'm never,ever gonna quit *

435
00:22:36,380 --> 00:22:38,680
Still can't believe you're here.

436
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:40,590
And I still can't believe
you ate a cheeseburger.

437
00:22:40,590 --> 00:22:42,950
Never repeat that to anyone or you die.

438
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:47,070
I'm so sorry I put you through all that.

439
00:22:47,070 --> 00:22:48,960
I'm here with you now. So...

440
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:50,780
Let the mending begin.

441
00:22:52,180 --> 00:22:53,580
So how soon can we get away?

442
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:55,240
The boat comes back for us tomorrow.

443
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:56,790
What'll we do in the meantime?

444
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:59,540
I was thinking we could
spend the afternoon

445
00:22:59,540 --> 00:23:02,060
Having hot,secret sex.

446
00:23:02,060 --> 00:23:03,500
Again?

447
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,260
Oh,my.

448
00:23:05,750 --> 00:23:08,540
you are back and better than ever.

449
00:23:14,130 --> 00:23:16,140
That never usually happens to me.

450
00:23:16,990 --> 00:23:18,520
It's okay.

451
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:22,440
Uh,my wife died recently,so...

452
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:24,820
Yeah,you mentioned that.

453
00:23:34,020 --> 00:23:36,590
Man,it's like africa hot in here.

454
00:23:36,590 --> 00:23:38,500
Will you do something already?

455
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:39,680
Yeah,give me two more secs,please?

456
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:41,740
You said that a half-hour ago.

457
00:23:42,710 --> 00:23:44,550
Man,I'm a bitch when I'm hot.

458
00:23:44,550 --> 00:23:45,590
Yeah,you're kind of a bitch

459
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:46,740
When you're cold,too,you know?

460
00:23:46,740 --> 00:23:48,410
That's part of my charm.

461
00:23:48,410 --> 00:23:50,350
Do me a favor,all right?

462
00:23:50,970 --> 00:23:52,310
Take your charm and go get me

463
00:23:52,310 --> 00:23:54,420
A pair of needle-nose pliers,please.

464
00:23:54,420 --> 00:23:56,440
I got you a pair of needle-nose pliers.

465
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:59,130
I also got you a hammer,a potato peeler

466
00:23:59,130 --> 00:24:00,870
And four different
kinds of wrenches,so--

467
00:24:00,870 --> 00:24:01,970
well,it's just that these things

468
00:24:01,970 --> 00:24:03,250
Are a little confusing,okay?

469
00:24:03,250 --> 00:24:04,530
They make it this way
so that you gotta call

470
00:24:04,530 --> 00:24:07,070
One of their service
reps to come fix it.

471
00:24:07,460 --> 00:24:09,000
you don't know what you're doing.

472
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,110
- Yeah,I do.
- Oh,my god.

473
00:24:11,110 --> 00:24:13,260
You are a terrible radiator repairman

474
00:24:13,260 --> 00:24:14,640
And a terrible liar.

475
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:16,140
So what are you even doing here?

476
00:24:16,140 --> 00:24:18,450
I told you. Justin left a
"playbill" in my car,okay?

477
00:24:18,450 --> 00:24:21,040
Justin would sooner leave me in a ditch

478
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:23,000
Than leave a "playbill" anywhere.

479
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:29,700
I came to see you.

480
00:24:33,110 --> 00:24:34,480
Bobby...

481
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:36,910
I'm in a relationship.

482
00:24:36,910 --> 00:24:38,420
Yeah,are you happy?

483
00:24:39,270 --> 00:24:40,810
What kind of a question is that?

484
00:24:40,810 --> 00:24:42,520
See,I've known you forever.

485
00:24:43,540 --> 00:24:44,940
I know what your face looks like

486
00:24:44,940 --> 00:24:46,840
When you're happy to be with someone.

487
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:49,160
I think about that face all the time.

488
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:50,250
Maybe I'm out of line,

489
00:24:50,250 --> 00:24:52,450
but I'm not seeing that face These days.

490
00:24:53,950 --> 00:24:56,250
Now you tell me I'm
wrong,I'll walk out the door.

491
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:00,700
You're wrong.

492
00:25:06,030 --> 00:25:07,070
Okay.

493
00:25:07,070 --> 00:25:08,430
Well,then,look,you should call somebody

494
00:25:08,430 --> 00:25:11,050
That knows how to fix
this,all right? 'cause I don't.

495
00:25:11,050 --> 00:25:12,360
Fine.

496
00:25:27,350 --> 00:25:30,830
Wilhelmina. Hello.

497
00:25:37,170 --> 00:25:39,200
Next time at least buy me a drink first.

498
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:42,090
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Uh,wow.

499
00:25:42,090 --> 00:25:44,390
I forgot that this was a topless pool.

500
00:25:45,250 --> 00:25:46,890
Is this a topless pool?

501
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:51,550
Uh,anyway,uh,uh,some
updates--

502
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:54,860
The model wrangler passed
out in the dolphin key.

503
00:25:54,860 --> 00:25:56,980
Apparently her method of
keeping the girls sober

504
00:25:56,980 --> 00:25:58,820
Was to down their drinks herself.

505
00:25:58,820 --> 00:26:02,430
Also the new swimwear is
here for your approval.

506
00:26:02,950 --> 00:26:04,920
C-can I get you a robe or something?

507
00:26:06,330 --> 00:26:08,350
Betty,betty,betty.

508
00:26:08,350 --> 00:26:10,660
Oh,take the stick out.

509
00:26:10,660 --> 00:26:12,780
Everythiil will be taken care of.

510
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:14,350
Um... How?

511
00:26:14,350 --> 00:26:16,350
Tonight you can watch
the models at cain.

512
00:26:16,350 --> 00:26:19,220
And tomorrow w wll wing
it with the swimwear.

513
00:26:19,530 --> 00:26:23,020
- "wing it"?
- Oh,it's island time,betty.

514
00:26:23,020 --> 00:26:25,010
Jump on board,man.

515
00:26:25,530 --> 00:26:27,030
Now scat.

516
00:26:32,530 --> 00:26:33,980
Here you go.

517
00:26:33,980 --> 00:26:35,960
This is amazing.

518
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:37,720
When did you do all this?

519
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:40,590
Oh,I,um,set it up before we left.

520
00:26:41,820 --> 00:26:43,980
Well,I am on board...

521
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:45,820
And on the pill.

522
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:48,940
That was a joke.

523
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:51,150
to...

524
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:55,110
Our first real date.

525
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:04,150
Bring it.

526
00:27:10,710 --> 00:27:12,000
You okay?

527
00:27:16,020 --> 00:27:17,220
No.

528
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:20,930
Look at me. I'm hot.

529
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:22,790
I'm actually having a really hard time

530
00:27:22,790 --> 00:27:25,920
Not ripping my own
clothes off,But you're...

531
00:27:26,660 --> 00:27:28,880
Not kissing me Like someone
who feels the same way.

532
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:31,810
Amanda,I would love to
rip your clothes off.

533
00:27:31,810 --> 00:27:32,810
Oh,thank you.

534
00:27:32,810 --> 00:27:35,100
But I have to ask you a question.

535
00:27:36,330 --> 00:27:38,420
Do you still have feelings for betty?

536
00:27:38,930 --> 00:27:40,230
'cause I don't want to get
in the middle of something

537
00:27:40,230 --> 00:27:41,340
That's unresolved.

538
00:27:41,340 --> 00:27:43,220
Betty has made it perfectly clear,

539
00:27:43,220 --> 00:27:45,080
She just sees me as a friend.

540
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:47,880
You didn't answer my question.

541
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:58,810
Okay,betty's not in
the bahamas for work.

542
00:27:58,810 --> 00:28:01,000
She's in the bahamas for you.

543
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,180
No. No,she's not.

544
00:28:03,420 --> 00:28:05,970
She still has feelings for you.

545
00:28:06,460 --> 00:28:09,580
And if you still have feelings for her,

546
00:28:10,190 --> 00:28:12,620
Then now would be a really
good time to tell her.

547
00:28:31,070 --> 00:28:32,450
how did things go with susannah?

548
00:28:32,450 --> 00:28:34,380
Uh,great. I mean,wow.

549
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:35,950
Not to talk out of school,

550
00:28:35,950 --> 00:28:39,080
But we did things I've
never even seen in movies.

551
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:42,440
Easy there,tiger. Anytime a
guy overcompensates that much,

552
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:44,820
It usually means the other
person wasn't into it.

553
00:28:44,820 --> 00:28:47,280
Oh,no. She was... She was into it.

554
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:50,870
Oh. Oh. You couldn't
get the rooster to crow.

555
00:28:51,950 --> 00:28:53,510
oh,marc. That never happens to me.

556
00:28:53,510 --> 00:28:55,370
I-I can get turned
on anywhere--

557
00:28:55,370 --> 00:28:57,170
elevators,atms,pharmacy...

558
00:28:57,170 --> 00:28:58,230
- Got it. -
Golf courses--

559
00:28:58,230 --> 00:28:59,630
- okay
- Even once at a bris.

560
00:29:00,020 --> 00:29:03,320
- I mean...
- Well,look,maybe the problem is,

561
00:29:03,860 --> 00:29:05,800
You're trying to be who you were before.

562
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:09,910
And you've changed since molly.

563
00:29:13,470 --> 00:29:15,860
When that happens,you know,it's...

564
00:29:16,650 --> 00:29:18,400
Hard to go back.

565
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:22,100
You're really smart.

566
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:27,920
No,wilhelmina is really lucky
to have you working with her.

567
00:29:29,690 --> 00:29:31,150
Thank you.

568
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:33,960
Would you please tell her that sometime?

569
00:29:35,390 --> 00:29:37,360
oh,noi'not sure.

570
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:40,320
I think that guy over there
might be playing for your team.

571
00:29:41,420 --> 00:29:44,770
oh,my god. You're
totally right. Good job.

572
00:29:44,770 --> 00:29:46,710
So if you'll excuse me...

573
00:29:46,710 --> 00:29:48,850
Refill. I've seen my future,

574
00:29:48,850 --> 00:29:51,400
And it's needlepoint and
double-a batteries in bulk.

575
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:54,030
Okay,console her because
matt doesn't love her.

576
00:29:54,030 --> 00:29:57,150
And you console him because
his weiner's not working.

577
00:29:57,670 --> 00:29:59,030
bye.

578
00:29:59,030 --> 00:30:01,880
Oh,my god,daniel.

579
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:03,550
Wait,daniel. What happened?

580
00:30:03,550 --> 00:30:05,750
When we were dating,you
could get turned on anywhere.

581
00:30:05,750 --> 00:30:07,340
Remember the shapiros' bris?

582
00:30:07,340 --> 00:30:08,890
I know. That's what I was saying.

583
00:30:08,890 --> 00:30:10,180
I...

584
00:30:10,950 --> 00:30:13,600
Look,I'm sorry about matt. I
know you really cared about him.

585
00:30:13,990 --> 00:30:17,220
yeah. pretty stupid.

586
00:30:17,220 --> 00:30:21,160
No,any guy who doesn't see
how great you are is an idiot.

587
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:24,270
You didn't see it.

588
00:30:24,270 --> 00:30:27,270
Yeah,but we all know... I'm an idiot.

589
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:28,950
Very true.

590
00:30:49,410 --> 00:30:51,070
Hey,girls. How we doing?

591
00:30:51,070 --> 00:30:52,460

High five. No five? Okay.

593
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:56,610
Gula,no drinkin'.

00:30:56,610 --> 00:30:58,930
Sorry,girls. Wilhelmina's rules.

595
00:30:58,930 --> 00:31:01,650

attractive,single ladies...

603
00:31:19,220 --> 00:31:21,650
Dancing,not drinking.

604
00:31:21,650 --> 00:31:22,780
Hey,ladies.

605
00:31:24,290 --> 00:31:26,030
Oh,yeah,actually,I'm with them.

606
00:31:26,030 --> 00:31:28,140
Um,I'm their chaperone!

607
00:31:29,820 --> 00:31:31,210

Wait. What about amanda?

611
00:31:49,210 --> 00:31:50,940
She's the one who sent me.

612
00:32:07,900 --> 00:32:11,430
Okay,okay. You made your point.

613
00:32:12,350 --> 00:32:15,220
I can't believe I met a
gay guy in the bahamas.

614
00:32:15,220 --> 00:32:16,740
Where are you from anyway?

615
00:32:16,740 --> 00:32:17,740
Oh,you're funny.

616
00:32:17,740 --> 00:32:19,180
You know I do lighting for "mode.

617
00:32:19,180 --> 00:32:20,730
" I can't believe I'm coming back

618
00:32:20,730 --> 00:32:22,480
from the bahamas With a boyfriend.

619
00:32:25,700 --> 00:32:28,490
Hey,you know,I'm really glad
you came after me last night.

620
00:32:28,490 --> 00:32:31,240
I'm glad you were Just sitting
in your car waiting for me.

621
00:32:32,550 --> 00:32:33,950
Don't you know by now?

622
00:32:33,950 --> 00:32:35,730
I'll always wait for you....

623
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:48,010
I took the liberty of ordering breakfast

624
00:32:48,010 --> 00:32:49,990
Before you head off to the shoot.

625
00:32:50,670 --> 00:32:52,390
Oh,I like
my new life--

626
00:32:52,390 --> 00:32:55,520
Waking up with you,eating food.

627
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:57,330
As soon as the shoot gets going,

628
00:32:57,330 --> 00:32:59,740
You slip away,meet me in the cabana,

629
00:33:00,050 --> 00:33:02,140
And then robert will get us to the boat.

630
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:06,220
That's room service.

631
00:33:12,130 --> 00:33:13,380
So...

632
00:33:14,270 --> 00:33:15,960
That happened.

633
00:33:19,180 --> 00:33:21,720
- ah Kinda crazy.
- Yeah.

634
00:33:22,420 --> 00:33:26,020
- But... Good,right?
- Yeah.

635
00:33:26,650 --> 00:33:27,890
Oh,I'll get it.

636
00:33:29,260 --> 00:33:31,310
- That's weird.
- Hello.

637
00:33:36,980 --> 00:33:38,380
the models are gone.

638
00:33:38,380 --> 00:33:40,290
- What do you mean,"gone"?
- I mean no one can find them,

639
00:33:40,290 --> 00:33:42,060
And no one can find willie either,

640
00:33:42,060 --> 00:33:44,720
And everyone's coming to me because
they assume That I'm her assistant.

641
00:33:45,110 --> 00:33:47,160
I'm sorry. I know
that's driving you crazy.

642
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:48,530
No,it's
okay. I--

643
00:33:48,530 --> 00:33:50,160
oh,hi,matt.

644
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:52,480
I tried to have an anonymous
fling in the bahamas,

645
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:54,650
And I ended up with someone from "mode.

646
00:33:55,060 --> 00:33:57,680
" Troy? He's always liked you.

647
00:33:57,680 --> 00:33:59,660
That was gula. The models are fine,

648
00:33:59,660 --> 00:34:01,530
But some of them got on
a boat with some guys,

649
00:34:01,530 --> 00:34:03,050
And now they're in cuba.

650
00:34:03,050 --> 00:34:04,640
What?
Gula--

651
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:07,010
she's our cover model.
The photo shoot starts.

652
00:34:07,010 --> 00:34:08,440
Well,I've got nowhere to be.

653
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:11,650
so I will be here to
help you solve this.

654
00:34:15,650 --> 00:34:17,350
I might have just solved it.

655
00:34:17,660 --> 00:34:19,280
Oh,come on.

656
00:34:24,190 --> 00:34:25,300
So for the cover,

657
00:34:25,300 --> 00:34:27,970
We would be shooting you
in a bikini on cove beach,

658
00:34:27,970 --> 00:34:29,400
But this isn't just any cover.

659
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:31,160
This is our fearless issue.

660
00:34:31,530 --> 00:34:32,760
I don't know.

661
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:34,950
Every magazine has a
bikini shot on the cover.

662
00:34:34,950 --> 00:34:37,670
I mean... That doesn't
sound very fearless to me.

663
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:40,950
Well,you're right,yeah.

664
00:34:43,750 --> 00:34:46,500
- Here's another way we could go.
- Really?

665
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:49,500
I'm telling you,I wear less
than this on a ski slope.

666
00:34:50,770 --> 00:34:54,850
Wow. You look amazing. Hips don't lie.

667
00:34:54,850 --> 00:34:56,990

- Okay. Oh,excuse me just one second.
- Okay.

680
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:23,780
Hi,wilhelmina.

681
00:35:23,780 --> 00:35:28,580
Um,so I had to make a couple of changes,

682
00:35:28,580 --> 00:35:31,780
But I assure you,there
were good reasons.

683
00:35:33,820 --> 00:35:35,270
It's not terrible.

684
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:38,780

Dps don't lie.

688
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:51,010
Oh,no. She doesn't like
it when you do that.

689
00:35:51,570 --> 00:35:52,810
Nice job getting her,by the way.

690
00:35:52,810 --> 00:35:54,760
This is gonna be a great cover.

691
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:56,510
Yeah,well,she really
liked that whole story

692
00:35:56,510 --> 00:35:58,490
About annette kellerman
causing the scandal

693
00:35:58,490 --> 00:36:01,660
And getting arrested for wearing
that swimsuit on the beach.

694
00:36:02,310 --> 00:36:04,780
- Who pitched that?
- I have do idea.

695
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:18,900
Everyone,stay seated.

696
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:30,160
Move in! This is the fbi.

697
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:32,290
Come out of the cabana
with your hands up.

698
00:36:36,750 --> 00:36:38,110
We've gotta get out of here now.

699
00:36:38,110 --> 00:36:41,510
It's too late. Someone tipped off
the fbi. They swarmed the boat.

700
00:36:41,510 --> 00:36:44,820
Well,then strap on a scuba
tank. We'll swim away.

701
00:36:44,820 --> 00:36:47,770
Willie,stop. We only have a few minutes.

702
00:36:47,770 --> 00:36:50,380
- You have to say it was you
that turned me in. - But--

703
00:36:50,380 --> 00:36:52,060
Use it to get back to "mode.

704
00:36:52,330 --> 00:36:53,980
" I can't.

705
00:36:56,060 --> 00:36:57,670
looks clear. Take the next one!

706
00:36:57,670 --> 00:36:59,130
You have to.

707
00:37:03,410 --> 00:37:05,380
He's in there!

708
00:37:08,340 --> 00:37:09,820
this is the fbi.

709
00:37:09,820 --> 00:37:11,620
Come out with your hands up.

710
00:37:11,620 --> 00:37:13,490
come on out. Exit the building.

711
00:37:13,490 --> 00:37:15,960
suspect is in custody. We're coming out.

712
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:20,850
he's alive.

713
00:37:20,850 --> 00:37:22,800
This is all your fault! You trapped me!

714
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:24,520
You're despicable.

715
00:37:39,070 --> 00:37:40,870
- Cute,right?
- Yeah.

716
00:37:40,870 --> 00:37:45,020
And I have one more surprise
for you. something extra special.

717
00:37:46,900 --> 00:37:48,780
- no.
- yes.

718
00:37:48,780 --> 00:37:49,960
Is this...

719
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:54,310
The bendy straw that shakira
actually used To sip her iced tea!

720
00:37:57,230 --> 00:37:59,400
oh,my god! You're back!

721
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:02,020
Tell me everything,even if
you have to make something up.

722
00:38:02,020 --> 00:38:05,750
I will,but first you
have a surprise in there.

723
00:38:08,180 --> 00:38:09,880
I made a big mistake.

724
00:38:13,490 --> 00:38:16,100
- Archie.
- We should've gone to the bahamas.

725
00:38:16,100 --> 00:38:20,040
I get so stupid sometimes
with my priorities.

726
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:21,700
- Yeah.
- Anyway...

727
00:38:21,700 --> 00:38:24,290
Look,I know one little dinner
is not gonna make up for it,

728
00:38:24,290 --> 00:38:29,130
But I,um,I hope we get
another chance to go someday.

729
00:38:39,310 --> 00:38:40,510
Hey,amanda.

730
00:38:40,510 --> 00:38:42,090
Uh,I just wanted to check in,

731
00:38:42,090 --> 00:38:43,650
You know,make sure we're cool.

732
00:38:43,650 --> 00:38:44,850
Totally.

733
00:38:45,210 --> 00:38:46,350
Good.

734
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:48,740
Okay,this is really weird.

735
00:38:48,740 --> 00:38:50,140
You're asking me about my feelings,

736
00:38:50,140 --> 00:38:53,290
And I haven't had one clingy
impulse since we did it.

737
00:38:54,270 --> 00:38:57,400
So we were there for each
other,And now we're good.

738
00:38:57,400 --> 00:38:58,460
Yeah.

739
00:38:58,460 --> 00:39:00,940
I guess we actually did this right.

740
00:39:05,660 --> 00:39:07,240
"mode" magazine. How can I help you?

741
00:39:07,240 --> 00:39:09,570
The bahamas proofs just came in,

742
00:39:09,570 --> 00:39:12,110
And not that you care about
other people's opinions,

743
00:39:12,110 --> 00:39:15,610
But the entire staff is buzzing
about how great they are.

744
00:39:16,140 --> 00:39:17,550
Oh,champagne.

745
00:39:18,470 --> 00:39:20,230
I thought that you'd be more...

746
00:39:20,230 --> 00:39:21,790
Heartbroken?

747
00:39:21,790 --> 00:39:23,410
connor is alive.

748
00:39:23,410 --> 00:39:25,300
That is reason enough for me.

749
00:39:25,300 --> 00:39:27,480
And since everyone
thinks I got him arrested,

750
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:29,330
I can write my own ticket at "mode,"

751
00:39:29,330 --> 00:39:31,610
Which means you still have your job.

752
00:39:31,610 --> 00:39:34,800
And you got your boy
shorts in a wad for nothing.

753
00:39:37,380 --> 00:39:38,490
Well...

754
00:39:39,210 --> 00:39:40,890
There's something I need to tell you.

755
00:39:42,670 --> 00:39:44,910
I've accepted a job from daniel...

756
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:47,510
As his assistant.

757
00:39:48,220 --> 00:39:49,930
so quit.

758
00:39:50,570 --> 00:39:52,380
Thing is,I don't want to.

759
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:55,820
I know it's not a job
as an editor,but...

760
00:39:56,590 --> 00:39:58,310
Somehow I think...

761
00:39:58,310 --> 00:40:01,840
Daniel will actually try
to make it happen for me.

762
00:40:11,390 --> 00:40:12,890
I made us some lunches.

763
00:40:12,890 --> 00:40:14,550
Um,turkey sandwiches,

764
00:40:14,550 --> 00:40:18,170
But I thought it would
be nice For us to stay in.

765
00:40:20,450 --> 00:40:21,630
What?

766
00:40:21,630 --> 00:40:23,130
If I'm not mistaken,it sounds like

767
00:40:23,130 --> 00:40:25,400
The "we slept
together,let's talk" lunch.

768
00:40:26,250 --> 00:40:27,990
I'm just scared,matt.

769
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:31,870
We've been through... A lot.

770
00:40:32,910 --> 00:40:35,690
And... What if it doesn't work out?

771
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:38,960
I really don't want to hurt you again.

772
00:40:39,380 --> 00:40:41,200
I don't want to hurt you either.

773
00:40:42,740 --> 00:40:43,960
Look...

774
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:46,090
There's no way to know
what's gonna happen.

775
00:40:46,090 --> 00:40:48,430
But I do know I want to find out.

776
00:40:49,430 --> 00:40:52,370
Yeah. Me,too.

777
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:55,770
Good.

778
00:40:57,630 --> 00:40:59,030
Maybe that's all we
need to know right now.

779
00:41:02,810 --> 00:41:04,960
Are those the proofs from the shoot?

780
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:08,000
Oh,yeah. I was gonna
call you about them.
