And this isnt even the worst of
trumps tweets today, this is:

00:02:32,526 --> 00:02:35,525
Donald Trump is telling his
Attorney General to shut down

39
00:02:35,526 --> 00:02:38,525
the investigation of Donald
Trump.

40
00:02:38,526 --> 00:02:41,525
Rudy should tell him that just
because hes doing it in public,

41
00:02:41,526 --> 00:02:45,525
doesnt mean its not
obstruction of justice.

42
00:02:45,526 --> 00:02:56,525

"Jeff sessions should shut it

Slow that down a little.

55
00:03:20,526 --> 00:03:23,525
Trumps freaking out this time
because its day two of the

56
00:03:23,526 --> 00:03:27,525
trial of former Trump campaign
manager and man undecided over

57
00:03:27,526 --> 00:03:32,525
which ostrich to wear, Paul
manafort.

<i>( Laughter )
Now, its a tough time for</i>

59
00:03:38,526 --> 00:03:40,525
manafort, but one person has
gone out of their way to be nice

60
00:03:40,526 --> 00:03:42,525
to him: The courtroom sketch
artist.

61
00:03:42,526 --> 00:03:47,525
ID say thats a very flattering
portrait.

62
00:03:47,526 --> 00:03:48,525
But thats just what he looks
like on the outside.

63
00:03:48,526 --> 00:03:50,525
Heres the sketch of his soul.

64
00:03:50,526 --> 00:03:54,525
<i>( Cheers and applause )
Of course, this is-- again, we</i>

65
00:03:54,526 --> 00:03:56,525
dont know.

66
00:03:56,526 --> 00:04:02,525
Of course, this is just
manaforts first trial.

67
00:04:02,526 --> 00:04:04,525
Hes actually got another one
coming up in D.C. that will

68
00:04:04,526 --> 00:04:06,525
focus more on manaforts actual
work for Ukraine, rather than

69
00:04:06,526 --> 00:04:09,525
his finances.

70
00:04:09,526 --> 00:04:11,525
And the charges include
conspiracy to defraud the united

71
00:04:11,526 --> 00:04:12,525
states.

72
00:04:12,526 --> 00:04:16,525
Yes, theres just too much crime
to pack into one trial.

73
00:04:16,526 --> 00:04:19,526
<i>( Laughter )

74
00:04:20,526 --> 00:04:24,525

Potter movie.

Flip them on trumpem.

80
00:04:38,526 --> 00:04:41,526
Things dont look good for
manafort.

81
00:04:42,196 --> 00:04:43,525
As one former prosecutor said,
manafort basically only has two

82
00:04:43,526 --> 00:04:47,525
real options at this point:
Prison or pardon.

83
00:04:47,526 --> 00:04:56,525
And its time for trumps new
game show: "Prison or pardon!"

84
00:04:56,526 --> 00:04:59,525
"Okay, okay, Paul manafort for
the pardon.

85
00:04:59,526 --> 00:05:00,525
Are you nervous?

86
00:05:00,526 --> 00:05:01,525
You should be.

87
00:05:01,526 --> 00:05:04,525
Okay.

88
00:05:04,526 --> 00:05:05,525
How much collusion was there?

89
00:05:05,526 --> 00:05:07,525
None, some, or, collusion
is not a crime?

90
00:05:07,526 --> 00:05:10,525
Would you like to phone a
friend?

91
00:05:10,526 --> 00:05:11,525
Tough (bleep).

92
00:05:11,526 --> 00:05:13,525
Theyre testifying against you.

93
00:05:13,526 --> 00:05:15,525
<i>( Laughter )
But-- you can take these away</i>

94
00:05:15,526 --> 00:05:17,525
now.

95
00:05:17,526 --> 00:05:19,525
But it looks like manaforts not
getting his pardon, in part

96
00:05:19,526 --> 00:05:23,525
because the trial isnt
televised, and according to

97
00:05:23,526 --> 00:05:25,525
one reporter, "if youre playing
for anything with president

98
00:05:25,526 --> 00:05:28,525
Trump, you almost have to appear
on television."

99
00:05:28,526 --> 00:05:33,525
Yes, for Trump to care about
you, you have to appear on TV.

100
00:05:33,526 --> 00:05:39,525
Which is why im pitching the
new CBS series "latino toddler,

101
00:05:39,526 --> 00:05:41,525

102
00:05:41,526 --> 00:05:43,525
<i>( Cheers and applause )

103
00:05:43,526 --> 00:05:46,525
Jon: You produced it?

104
00:05:46,526 --> 00:05:48,525
Stephen: Yeah, im

105
00:05:48,526 --> 00:05:50,525
Im producing that.

106
00:05:50,526 --> 00:05:52,525
But Trump does have sympathy for
manafort because he also

107
00:05:52,526 --> 00:05:53,526
tweeted, "looking back on
history, who was treated worse,

108
00:06:13,518 --> 00:06:14,517
Wow, wow.

109
00:06:14,518 --> 00:06:18,517
Trump really knows how to make
you seem sympathetic: Compare

They wont even let him have
syphilis."

115
00:06:33,518 --> 00:06:38,528
<i>( Laughter )
And why, why on earth is Trump</i>

116
00:06:39,518 --> 00:06:41,648
calling Capone "alphonse?"
Does he think it makes him seem

117
00:06:42,518 --> 00:06:43,517
classier?

118
00:06:43,518 --> 00:06:46,517
"Ah, yes, the esteemed company

00:07:03,518 --> 00:07:12,517
Yesterday Trump headed down to

00:09:48,518 --> 00:09:50,517
Do I put the coins in your
mouth?

178
00:09:50,518 --> 00:09:51,517
Do I leave the money on the
dresser?

179
00:09:51,518 --> 00:09:54,517
You know what?

180
00:09:54,518 --> 00:09:56,517
<i>( Laughter )
You know what, you know what?</i>

181
00:09:56,518 --> 00:09:59,517
Ill tell you what, ill tell
what you-- im asking.

182
00:09:59,518 --> 00:10:01,517
I dont know.

183
00:10:01,518 --> 00:10:06,517
<i>( Applause )
I dont know.</i>

184
00:10:06,518 --> 00:10:07,517
Im gonna leave.

185
00:10:07,518 --> 00:10:10,517
My lawyer will be in touch.

186
00:10:10,518 --> 00:10:11,518
This never happened."

187
00:10:12,068 --> 00:10:17,517
Trump has been taking heat
because farmers have been hurt

188
00:10:17,518 --> 00:10:23,517
by his tariffs, but he knows
these farmers are doing fine.

189
00:10:23,518 --> 00:10:25,517
China had others-- remember
this-- have targeted our

190
00:10:25,518 --> 00:10:26,517
farmers.

191
00:10:26,518 --> 00:10:27,517
Not good, not nice.

192
00:10:27,518 --> 00:10:31,517
And you know what our farmers
are saying?

193
00:10:31,518 --> 00:10:32,517
"Its okay, we can take it."

194
00:10:32,518 --> 00:10:32,518
These are incredible people.

195
00:10:32,568 --> 00:10:35,517
"We can take it."

196
00:10:35,518 --> 00:10:37,517
Stephen: Oh, yeah, yeah,
oh, yeah.

197
00:10:37,518 --> 00:10:40,517
Farmers can take it.

198
00:10:40,518 --> 00:10:43,517
In fact, they love these
tariffs.

199
00:10:43,518 --> 00:10:44,518
I believe we have a statement
from the head of the American

200
00:10:45,068 --> 00:10:45,518
farm bureau:
Thank you, sir.

201
00:10:46,108 --> 00:10:49,517
May I have another?

202
00:10:49,518 --> 00:10:50,518

203

204
00:10:51,518 --> 00:10:58,517
Stephen: But-- im not sure
if that was it.

205
00:10:58,518 --> 00:11:02,517
But the biggest story out of
last nights rally involved CNN

206
00:11:02,518 --> 00:11:05,517
reporter and man mad at the
sunset for being beautiful, Jim

207
00:11:05,518 --> 00:11:08,517
acosta.

208
00:11:08,518 --> 00:11:11,517
Trump has been attacking acosta
and the rest of CNN, and his

209
00:11:11,518 --> 00:11:14,517
supporters at the rally piled
on.

210
00:11:14,518 --> 00:11:17,517
And, wolf, just to give you a
sense of whats happening right

211
00:11:17,518 --> 00:11:20,517
now, you can hear there is a
chorus of boos and other chants

212
00:11:20,518 --> 00:11:24,517
of this Trump crowd here in
tampa Florida, saying things

213
00:11:24,518 --> 00:11:29,517
like "CNN sucks," "go home," and
"fake news."

214
00:11:29,518 --> 00:11:30,517
Wolf, obviously, all those
things are false.

215
00:11:30,518 --> 00:11:32,517
Were staying right here.

216
00:11:32,518 --> 00:11:32,517
Well do our job and report on
this rally to all of our viewers

217
00:11:32,518 --> 00:11:36,517
here tonight.

218
00:11:36,518 --> 00:11:37,517
Stephen: "Yes, were going to
ignore these people shouting

219
00:11:37,518 --> 00:11:39,517
hateful things, and get to the
news: The president of the

220
00:11:39,518 --> 00:11:46,517
United States shouting hateful
things.

221
00:11:46,518 --> 00:11:47,517
- Acosta<i> (</i>

222
00:11:47,518 --> 00:11:51,517
-- Yeah.

223
00:11:51,518 --> 00:11:52,517
Jon: Same thing.

224
00:11:52,518 --> 00:11:55,517
Stephen: Fans of shouting
here tonight.

225
00:11:55,518 --> 00:11:56,517
Acosta even posted some footage
of the crowd attacking him

226
00:11:56,518 --> 00:11:58,518
directly.

227
00:12:11,518 --> 00:12:17,517
<i>( Laughter )
Stephen: Its going to see</i>

228
00:12:17,518 --> 00:12:19,517
roseanne keeping busy.

229
00:12:19,518 --> 00:12:23,517
( Cheers and applause )
But-- she looks good.

230
00:12:23,518 --> 00:12:25,517
She looks really good.

231
00:12:25,518 --> 00:12:27,517
Jon: It look like her to
you?

232
00:12:27,518 --> 00:12:27,517
Stephen: Rested.

233
00:12:27,518 --> 00:12:30,517
She looks really rested.

234
00:12:30,518 --> 00:12:32,517
But it turns out this vicious
mob may not truly despise

235
00:12:32,518 --> 00:12:36,517
acosta, because another reporter
at the rally last night pointed

236
00:12:36,518 --> 00:12:44,517
out that, "Trump supporters can
boo and say forever that they

237
00:12:44,518 --> 00:12:46,517
hate CNN and @acosta, but after
the cameras are off, all I see

238
00:12:46,518 --> 00:12:48,517
is them asking his opinion on
everything under the sun and if

239
00:12:48,518 --> 00:12:51,517
they can take pictures with
him."

240
00:12:51,518 --> 00:12:58,517
"Hey, acosta, you lying sack of
crap-- can I get an autograph?

241
00:12:58,518 --> 00:13:01,517
Make it out and sign it,
Jim acosta, lying sack of

242
00:13:01,518 --> 00:13:04,517
crap."
thanks so much.

243
00:13:04,518 --> 00:13:06,517
Its for my grandmother."

244
00:13:06,518 --> 00:13:10,517
So theyre kind of-- theyre
kind of play-acting-- it seems

245
00:13:10,518 --> 00:13:14,517
like theyre play-acting their
anger for the cameras.

246
00:13:14,518 --> 00:13:16,517
In fact, many journalists said
that the crowd booing at trumps

247
00:13:16,518 --> 00:13:18,517
enemies was like a wrestling
bout.

248
00:13:18,518 --> 00:13:22,517
So, Jim acosta, you should
just embrace your new role as a

249
00:13:22,518 --> 00:13:28,517
wrestling villain like this:
"Listen up and listen good,

250
00:13:28,518 --> 00:13:29,517
baby!

251
00:13:29,518 --> 00:13:31,517

And sources!

257
00:13:40,518 --> 00:13:43,517
Can I get a "hell, yeah"?

"So, look out, Donnie-boy,</i>

259
00:13:52,518 --> 00:13:53,517
because im challenging you to a
press conference, no questions

260

Im gonna spank you harder than
stormy Daniels with a rolled-up

Forbes, baby.
So get ready, trumpy, because

264
00:14:04,518 --> 00:14:05,517
the pain train is coming, and
youre going down.

265

Wooo-wooo!

266
00:14:09,518 --> 00:14:14,517
And this time, its gonna be on
the record."

weve got a great show for you

Ewan McGregor is here.

Ryan is a man.

welcome back.

278
00:15:11,518 --> 00:15:14,517
You know, there was some
surprising news recently for

279
00:15:14,518 --> 00:15:16,517
speaker of the house and man
test-driving the concept of

280
00:15:16,518 --> 00:15:21,517
smiling, Paul Ryan.

281
00:15:21,518 --> 00:15:23,517
Ryan is going to appear on the
upcoming season of pbss

282
00:15:23,518 --> 00:15:27,517
"finding your roots with Henry
Louis gates Jr.," a TV series in

283
00:15:27,518 --> 00:15:29,517
which famous guests learn about
their ancestral histories.

284
00:15:29,518 --> 00:15:32,517
I assumed the most shocking
thing theyd find was that

285
00:15:32,518 --> 00:15:37,517
Ryans great-grandparents were
Eddie munster and grover.

286
00:15:37,518 --> 00:15:40,517
<i>( Laughter )
But it turns out they found</i>

287
00:15:40,518 --> 00:15:40,517
something way more unexpected.

288
00:15:40,518 --> 00:15:41,898
Surprise!

289
00:15:42,518 --> 00:15:49,517
Paul Ryans slightly Jewish!

290
00:15:49,518 --> 00:15:52,517

suffered enough?

I just--
the anti-defamation league has

294
00:16:04,518 --> 00:16:06,517
already responded, saying,
"what?

297
00:16:09,518 --> 00:16:14,517
This, naturally, leads to one
burning question: Paul Ryan, are

298
00:16:14,518 --> 00:16:18,517
you even circumcised, bro?

299
00:16:18,518 --> 00:16:22,517
<i>( Laughter )
Im guessing no, but, Paul,</i>

300
00:16:22,518 --> 00:16:24,517
thats the price of admission.

307
00:16:49,518 --> 00:16:52,518

Its the other guy.

354
00:18:58,518 --> 00:19:00,517
Stephen: I hear hes good,
too.

355
00:19:00,518 --> 00:19:03,517
Its the pooh im familiar
with.

356
00:19:03,518 --> 00:19:06,517
Stephen: Its the perfect
pooh voice.

357
00:19:06,518 --> 00:19:09,517
And youre pretty good, too.

358
00:19:09,518 --> 00:19:13,517
It really sounds like Ewan
McGregor.

359
00:19:13,518 --> 00:19:15,517
They have a guy that does me.

360
00:19:15,518 --> 00:19:18,517
Stephen: Well, you are a
star.

361
00:19:18,518 --> 00:19:20,518
Im sure they provideicatering
of all sorts.

362
00:19:21,518 --> 00:19:23,517
All sorts, yes.

363
00:19:23,518 --> 00:19:27,517
Stephen: Did you play the
grown-up Christopher Robin, what

364
00:19:27,518 --> 00:19:30,517
was it like working across from
that bear?

365
00:19:30,518 --> 00:19:31,517
Did you grow up with the books?

366
00:19:31,518 --> 00:19:34,517
I did.

367
00:19:34,518 --> 00:19:36,517
I I was read the books as a kid.

368
00:19:36,518 --> 00:19:41,517
And read them to my kids, and
I I was familiar with them, and

369
00:19:41,518 --> 00:19:44,517
the Disney cartoons for sure,
and the voices.

370
00:19:44,518 --> 00:19:48,517
Then to be on set with him,
pooh-- it was amazing.

371
00:19:48,518 --> 00:19:51,018
They had a little pooh, that I--<i>
(</i>

372
00:19:51,019 --> 00:19:53,517
<i>laughter )</i>

373
00:19:53,518 --> 00:19:56,517
-- That I got to play with on
set.

374
00:19:56,518 --> 00:20:00,517
So we had a real-- we had a
little Teddy bear that looks

375
00:20:00,518 --> 00:20:03,517
exactly like the pooh you see in
the film there.

376
00:20:03,518 --> 00:20:04,728
But hes not a puppet.

377
00:20:05,518 --> 00:20:08,517
He wasntab anamatronnic.

378
00:20:08,518 --> 00:20:12,517
He was just to look at.

379
00:20:12,518 --> 00:20:15,517
And his little face looked up at
me, and I got used to working

380
00:20:15,518 --> 00:20:18,518
with this Teddy bear, and I
really liked working with him.

381
00:20:19,318 --> 00:20:20,517
<i>( Laughter )
He was so easy to work with.</i>

382
00:20:20,518 --> 00:20:22,517
Stephen: He didnt step on
your lines.

383
00:20:22,518 --> 00:20:23,517
No!

384
00:20:23,518 --> 00:20:26,517
He was very generous, and he was
always there on camera.

385
00:20:26,518 --> 00:20:30,517
Stephen: Giving you 100%,
even though he wasnt on.

386
00:20:30,518 --> 00:20:32,517
Lets see how familiar you are
with these books.

387
00:20:32,518 --> 00:20:33,517
Okay.

388
00:20:33,518 --> 00:20:38,517
Stephen: Im going to try
to stump you with a simple one.

389
00:20:38,518 --> 00:20:40,517
What is the bears name.

390
00:20:40,518 --> 00:20:45,517
Winnie ther pooh.

391
00:20:45,518 --> 00:20:49,517
Stephen: Its winnie ther
pooh.

392
00:20:49,518 --> 00:20:50,517
Stephen: Exactly.

393
00:20:50,518 --> 00:20:53,517
Stephen: What is his
official name?

394
00:20:53,518 --> 00:20:58,517
Christopher Robin calls him
winnie ther pooh.

395
00:20:58,518 --> 00:20:59,517
Here comes I.

396
00:20:59,518 --> 00:21:01,517
Edward.

397
00:21:01,518 --> 00:21:03,517
So far im doing well.

398
00:21:03,518 --> 00:21:06,517
Stephen: I understand you
took a break after-- what does

399
00:21:06,518 --> 00:21:09,517
that mean "take a break?"
You took a break from acting.

400
00:21:09,518 --> 00:21:11,517
I didnt work.

401
00:21:11,518 --> 00:21:16,517
We finished winnie ther pooh, or
"Christopher Robin," and I

402
00:21:16,518 --> 00:21:17,517
havent worked since then.

403
00:21:17,518 --> 00:21:19,517
And ive never done that.

404
00:21:19,518 --> 00:21:22,517
Ive taken, I dont know, a
six-month break in all the years

405
00:21:22,518 --> 00:21:27,517
ive been working, but this time
I took a long chunk of time off.

406
00:21:27,518 --> 00:21:29,517
Stephen: That sound lovely,
but is it actually lovely in

407
00:21:29,518 --> 00:21:30,517
reality?

408
00:21:30,518 --> 00:21:31,517
Yeah, it was.

409
00:21:31,518 --> 00:21:33,517
I didnt know exactly how I
would deal with it, either.

410
00:21:33,518 --> 00:21:37,517
Because I was never very, very
good at doing nothing or having

411
00:21:37,518 --> 00:21:38,517
nothing to do.

412
00:21:38,518 --> 00:21:41,517
I would take a break knowing I
had a film come coming up or a

413
00:21:41,518 --> 00:21:44,517
play or something to do, and
this time I just had space.

414
00:21:44,518 --> 00:21:46,517
But I really enjoyed it.

415
00:21:46,518 --> 00:21:51,517
And I cant really tell what you
I did, because I dont-- doing

416
00:21:51,518 --> 00:21:53,068
nothing, I was quite busy.

417
00:21:53,518 --> 00:21:55,517
I was quite busy doing nothing.

418
00:21:55,518 --> 00:21:56,517
That song.

419
00:21:56,518 --> 00:22:00,517
♪ Busy doing nothing
working the whole day through

420
00:22:00,518 --> 00:22:03,517
♪ trying to find lots of things
not to do

421
00:22:03,518 --> 00:22:07,517
♪ were busy doing nothing
♪ isnt it just a crime?

422
00:22:07,518 --> 00:22:12,517
♪ Wed like to be unhappy but we
never do have the time ♪

423
00:22:12,518 --> 00:22:14,517
<i>( Applause )
I think its from-- I think its</i>

424
00:22:14,518 --> 00:22:16,517
from "kiss me Kate."

425
00:22:16,518 --> 00:22:18,517
Stephen: Okay.

426
00:22:18,518 --> 00:22:21,517
Do you feel guilty take time--
not guilty-- guilty to your

427
00:22:21,518 --> 00:22:23,517
younger self?

428
00:22:23,518 --> 00:22:26,517
Because your younger self, im
sure-- speaking of myself as

429
00:22:26,518 --> 00:22:29,517
someone who was a young actor--
there was never enough work

430
00:22:29,518 --> 00:22:33,517
because you were always
scrambling, and now youre like,

431
00:22:33,518 --> 00:22:35,517
"im not going to work for a
while."

432
00:22:35,518 --> 00:22:41,517
If I did that, I would hear my
younger self say, "what are you

433
00:22:41,518 --> 00:22:41,517
doing?

434
00:22:41,518 --> 00:22:42,517
Youll never work again."

435
00:22:42,518 --> 00:22:46,517
I got to the point where I
was working, working, working.

436
00:22:46,518 --> 00:22:47,517
I have things I like to do.

437
00:22:47,518 --> 00:22:50,688
I arev motorcycles and cars and
I like to see my children, walk

438
00:22:51,518 --> 00:22:52,517
my dog.

439
00:22:52,518 --> 00:22:55,517
And I was working and not
feeling that I had time for

440
00:22:55,518 --> 00:22:56,517
those things.

441
00:22:56,518 --> 00:22:59,517
And I was thinking what am I
working for?

442
00:22:59,518 --> 00:23:00,517
And so I decided to stop.

443
00:23:00,518 --> 00:23:03,517
And I did all those things, and
it was great.

444
00:23:03,518 --> 00:23:05,517
And now im going back to work
in September.

445
00:23:05,518 --> 00:23:13,517
Im doing a movie called
"Dr. Sleep" a Stephen King

446
00:23:13,518 --> 00:23:13,518
novel.

447
00:23:14,518 --> 00:23:15,517
That one person!

448
00:23:15,518 --> 00:23:16,517
Stephen: Thats another--
so in "Christopher Robin" youre

449
00:23:16,518 --> 00:23:18,517
playing a grown-up child.

450
00:23:18,518 --> 00:23:19,517
Yeah.

451
00:23:19,518 --> 00:23:24,517
Stephen: Youre playing
Christopher grown up, and now

452
00:23:24,518 --> 00:23:27,518
youre playing Danny torrence
from "the shining."

453
00:23:27,858 --> 00:23:30,517
Can you tell me-- I havent read
the book.

454
00:23:30,518 --> 00:23:33,517
Its very faithful to the
book, the script.

455
00:23:33,518 --> 00:23:35,517
If youve read the novel, thats
the story.

456
00:23:35,518 --> 00:23:38,517
Stephen: Dont give
anything away but read the book.

457
00:23:38,518 --> 00:23:41,517
You can read the book and
find out what happens.

458
00:23:41,518 --> 00:23:44,517
Stephen: Does Danny still
have psychic power?

459
00:23:44,518 --> 00:23:45,517
Yes.

460
00:23:45,518 --> 00:23:46,517
Stephen: And thats all you
can tell me?

461
00:23:46,518 --> 00:23:47,517
Yes.

462
00:23:47,518 --> 00:23:49,517
I told you lots of other things
right now.

463
00:23:49,518 --> 00:23:50,517
Stephen: Exactly.

464
00:23:50,518 --> 00:23:51,517
Exactly.

465
00:23:51,518 --> 00:23:53,517
You showed me some horrible
images.

466
00:23:53,518 --> 00:23:54,517
Have you ever met Stephen King?

467
00:23:54,518 --> 00:23:56,517
No, but im looking forward
to it.

468
00:23:56,518 --> 00:23:59,517
I have not done so, but ID like
to.

469
00:23:59,518 --> 00:24:01,517
Stephen: Very pleasant and
creepy at the same time.

470
00:24:01,518 --> 00:24:02,517
Oh, yeah.

471
00:24:02,518 --> 00:24:04,517
Stephen: I have a prized
picture of the two of us

472
00:24:04,518 --> 00:24:06,517
together.

473
00:24:06,518 --> 00:24:09,517
We had a lovely-- this is me, me
and Stephen ceng just hanging

474
00:24:09,518 --> 00:24:10,517
out together.

475
00:24:10,518 --> 00:24:13,517
Thats what hes like all the
time.

476
00:24:13,518 --> 00:24:14,517
<i>( Laughter )
Did you--</i>

477
00:24:14,518 --> 00:24:18,517
did you dress similarly on
purpose?

478
00:24:18,518 --> 00:24:19,517
Oh, twins.

479
00:24:19,518 --> 00:24:22,517
Stephen: Yes, we were
creepy twins together.

480
00:24:22,518 --> 00:24:25,517
You have been an ambassador for
unicef.

481
00:24:25,518 --> 00:24:26,517
Yes.

482
00:24:26,518 --> 00:24:27,517
Stephen: For how long?

483
00:24:27,518 --> 00:24:28,608
Since 2004.

484
00:24:29,518 --> 00:24:32,517
My friend Charlie and I did a
motorcycle trip in 2004 from

485
00:24:32,518 --> 00:24:36,517
London to New York, we went east
from London, and then --

486
00:24:36,518 --> 00:24:38,517
Stephen: You drove across
Asia.

487
00:24:38,518 --> 00:24:43,517
We rode across Europe and
Ukraine and Russia and

488
00:24:43,518 --> 00:24:50,517
Kazakhstan and Mongolia and we
flew the bikes to Anchorage and

489
00:24:50,518 --> 00:24:52,517
--
Stephen: You flew the bikes b

490
00:24:52,518 --> 00:24:53,517
to Anchorage?

491
00:24:53,518 --> 00:24:56,518
You didnt think of getting a
lot of speed up over the

492
00:24:57,518 --> 00:24:58,517
peninsula and jump it.

493
00:24:58,518 --> 00:24:59,517
Like a man would.

494
00:24:59,518 --> 00:25:02,517
Or do it in winter when you can
go across the ice.

495
00:25:02,518 --> 00:25:05,517
Stephen: Or skip across the
crab boats.

496
00:25:05,518 --> 00:25:06,517
What is this?

497
00:25:06,518 --> 00:25:06,518
Where are you here?

498
00:25:06,818 --> 00:25:09,517
That look likes in Iraq, I
think.

499
00:25:09,518 --> 00:25:14,517
Yeah, thats in Iraq, a year--
18 months ago I visited

500
00:25:14,518 --> 00:25:17,517
different refugee camps in Iraq
with unicef, and that was

501
00:25:17,518 --> 00:25:18,517
extraordinary.

502
00:25:18,518 --> 00:25:22,517
I mean, its impossible to
imagine the scale of the problem

503
00:25:22,518 --> 00:25:23,517
and how many people are
affected.

504
00:25:23,518 --> 00:25:26,517
I was just in three different
camps in Iraq for people that

505
00:25:26,518 --> 00:25:31,517
had fled from mosul, really, and
different parts of Iraq because

506
00:25:31,518 --> 00:25:32,517
there are problems there.

507
00:25:32,518 --> 00:25:35,648
You would stand and look out and
all-- im not joking-- all you

508
00:25:36,518 --> 00:25:41,517
could see were temporary tents,
a-frame tents, frame tents, on

509
00:25:41,518 --> 00:25:44,517
the horizon, just thousands and
thousands and thousands of them,

510
00:25:44,518 --> 00:25:48,517
and you turned around and looked
behind you and all you could see

511
00:25:48,518 --> 00:25:52,517
were graders making the earth
flat for thousands and thousands

512
00:25:52,518 --> 00:25:55,517
more they were going to build
for everybody else being kicked

513
00:25:55,518 --> 00:25:56,517
out of their homes.

514
00:25:56,518 --> 00:25:58,517
It was very extraordinary.

515
00:25:58,518 --> 00:26:01,517
I love unicef and have been so
honored to work with them since

516
00:26:01,518 --> 00:26:03,517
then, since 2004.

517
00:26:03,518 --> 00:26:06,517
I love the work they do on a
very simple way with children in

518
00:26:06,518 --> 00:26:10,688
the field, like giving them
these play areas in refugee

519
00:26:11,518 --> 00:26:14,517
camps-- or wherever it be--
where children can be children

520
00:26:14,518 --> 00:26:14,517
again and just play.

521
00:26:14,518 --> 00:26:16,517
And thats wonderful.

522
00:26:16,518 --> 00:26:19,517
But they also deal with
governments at the governmental

523
00:26:19,518 --> 00:26:21,517
level and everything in between.

524
00:26:21,518 --> 00:26:24,517
And ive always been-- its been
a great honor for me to work

525
00:26:24,518 --> 00:26:28,517
with them as best I can to do

Thank you.

Stephen: Hello?

555

Hello.

556
00:27:57,518 --> 00:27:58,517
Stephen: Thanks for being
on.

557
00:27:58,518 --> 00:28:00,517
Thank you so much for having
me.

558
00:28:00,518 --> 00:28:01,517
Its such a thrill to be here.

559
00:28:01,518 --> 00:28:04,517
Stephen: I understand you
started off-- did you live in

560
00:28:04,518 --> 00:28:06,517
New York when you started?

561
00:28:06,518 --> 00:28:11,517
I did, I started off at the
upgrade brigade citizens in new

562
00:28:11,518 --> 00:28:12,517
York city.

563
00:28:12,518 --> 00:28:14,517
Stephen: Quality
enterprise.

564
00:28:14,518 --> 00:28:15,517
Quality enterprise.

565
00:28:15,518 --> 00:28:17,517
Stephen: Thats
improvisation which, of course,

566
00:28:17,518 --> 00:28:19,517
is very useful for an actor.

567
00:28:19,518 --> 00:28:23,517
But then you actually did-- you
did the actors studio.

568
00:28:23,518 --> 00:28:26,517
I graduated from want new
school of the actors studio.

569
00:28:26,518 --> 00:28:31,517
Stephen: Thats like Stan
slof ski?

570
00:28:31,518 --> 00:28:33,517
I dont know.

571
00:28:33,518 --> 00:28:34,517
Stephen: You dont know.

572
00:28:34,518 --> 00:28:36,517
I was so checked out.

573
00:28:36,518 --> 00:28:41,517
As soon as I got to the new
school I spent my nights at the

574
00:28:41,518 --> 00:28:45,517
upright citizens brigade, and my
days sleeping through the new

575
00:28:45,518 --> 00:28:49,517
school, so I dont really know
anything about acting.

576
00:28:49,518 --> 00:28:54,517
<i>( Laughter )
Stephen: Did you read "an</i>

577
00:28:54,518 --> 00:28:58,517
actor prepares" by constan steen
Stan slof ski?

578
00:28:58,518 --> 00:28:59,517
Yeah.

579
00:28:59,518 --> 00:29:03,517
Stephen: Did you go to any
of those "inside the actor"

580
00:29:03,518 --> 00:29:04,517
studios.

581
00:29:04,518 --> 00:29:06,517
I went to half of one.

582
00:29:06,518 --> 00:29:06,517
<i>( Laughter ).</i>

583
00:29:06,518 --> 00:29:09,517
Stephen: Who was it?

584
00:29:09,518 --> 00:29:12,517
Well-- so they make you go to
one to graduate.

585
00:29:12,518 --> 00:29:15,517
And I, obviously, blew that off.

586
00:29:15,518 --> 00:29:17,517
And then right before I
graduated, like, you have to go

587
00:29:17,518 --> 00:29:18,517
to one.

588
00:29:18,518 --> 00:29:23,517
But the only one left of the
season was Jennifer Lopez.

589
00:29:23,518 --> 00:29:28,517
Which is, like, I dont-- I
guess people find it funny that

590
00:29:28,518 --> 00:29:31,517
she had an "inside the actor"
studio.

591
00:29:31,518 --> 00:29:34,517
Im a big Jennifer Lopez fan.

592
00:29:34,518 --> 00:29:36,517
"Out of sight" is one of my
favorite movies.

593
00:29:36,518 --> 00:29:39,517
And then shes made, like,
others.

594
00:29:39,518 --> 00:29:42,517
<i>( Laughter )
Stephen: Can we fact check</i>

595
00:29:42,518 --> 00:29:43,517
that?

596
00:29:43,518 --> 00:29:44,517
Am I right about that.

597
00:29:44,518 --> 00:29:46,517
Stephen: Theyre telling me
she made other movies.

598
00:29:46,518 --> 00:29:47,517
Look at that!

599
00:29:47,518 --> 00:29:48,517
I was right!

600
00:29:48,518 --> 00:29:49,517
So I had to go to that.

601
00:29:49,518 --> 00:29:55,517
And it-- I love Jennifer loped,
like I said, but, you know,

602
00:29:55,518 --> 00:30:00,517
there are so many answers of
questions about the movie "u.

603
00:30:00,518 --> 00:30:01,517
Turn one person can take."

604
00:30:01,518 --> 00:30:06,517
So when the mic got passed to me
to ask a question I kind of

605
00:30:06,518 --> 00:30:09,517
blacked out or something and
decided to do a bit.

606
00:30:09,518 --> 00:30:18,517
And I got up and I was like,
"j.Lo," and she went,

607
00:30:18,518 --> 00:30:19,517
"Jennifer."

608
00:30:19,518 --> 00:30:20,518
And right away I was like, "oh,
god.

609
00:30:21,398 --> 00:30:21,517
This is bad.

610
00:30:21,518 --> 00:30:22,517
This is bad."

611
00:30:22,518 --> 00:30:23,517
But I powered through.

612
00:30:23,518 --> 00:30:25,517
And she was like "Jennifer."

613
00:30:25,518 --> 00:30:30,517
And I said, "I know that you
recently have gone through a

614
00:30:30,518 --> 00:30:36,517
breakup with-- with Casey
affleck"-- dont know why I said

615
00:30:36,518 --> 00:30:37,517
that.

616
00:30:37,518 --> 00:30:41,517
<i>( Laughter )
To which she then quickly</i>

617
00:30:41,518 --> 00:30:42,517
responded, "Ben."

618
00:30:42,518 --> 00:30:46,517
And I was like, "sure, sure,
sure, sure, sure."

619
00:30:46,518 --> 00:30:50,188
Even then people were
embarrassed to be confused to

620
00:30:50,518 --> 00:30:53,517
have an allegiance with Casey
affleck.

621
00:30:53,518 --> 00:30:54,517
Shots fired!

622
00:30:54,518 --> 00:30:58,517
So then-- this is a terrible
long story.

623
00:30:58,518 --> 00:31:05,517
<i>( Laughter )
So then I said, "so ive been</i>

624
00:31:05,518 --> 00:31:07,517
through a breakup, too,
recently.

625
00:31:07,518 --> 00:31:08,517
And I dont know.

626
00:31:08,518 --> 00:31:10,517
Im just feeling like we have a
connection."

627
00:31:10,518 --> 00:31:19,517
<i>( Laughter )
Meanwhile, im, like, 21, way</i>

628
00:31:19,518 --> 00:31:20,517
high.

629
00:31:20,518 --> 00:31:26,517
<i>( Laughter )
And all the real j. Lo fans are,</i>

630
00:31:26,518 --> 00:31:27,517
like, not happy.

631
00:31:27,518 --> 00:31:28,517
Stephen: Sure, and she is
not either.

632
00:31:28,518 --> 00:31:30,517
And shes look at me.

633
00:31:30,518 --> 00:31:31,518
Shes being so sweet, you know.

634
00:31:32,518 --> 00:31:35,517
Shes looking at me like this is
obviously this kid kidding

635
00:31:35,518 --> 00:31:36,517
around.

636
00:31:36,518 --> 00:31:38,517
And then I went even further--
so dumb.

637
00:31:38,518 --> 00:31:43,517
And I was like, "so if youd
like to maybe after your taping,

638
00:31:43,518 --> 00:31:52,517
I represented the DVD of the
movie big fish," which is so

639
00:31:52,518 --> 00:31:53,517
random.

640
00:31:53,518 --> 00:31:54,517
I dont know why.

641
00:31:54,518 --> 00:31:57,517
There was no Netflix and chill
at the time.

642
00:31:57,518 --> 00:31:59,318
<i>( Laughter )
And I was like, "if you want to</i>

643
00:31:59,518 --> 00:32:00,517
come watch it with me."

644
00:32:00,518 --> 00:32:03,517
And she was very sweet and she
was like, "oh, now, thank you

645
00:32:03,518 --> 00:32:04,517
very much."

646
00:32:04,518 --> 00:32:07,517
And it didnt get a laugh,
obviously, and I was horribly

647
00:32:07,518 --> 00:32:08,517
embarrassed.

648
00:32:08,518 --> 00:32:12,517
So I sat back down thinking oh,
god that was very-- very-- very

649
00:32:12,518 --> 00:32:13,517
dumb.

650
00:32:13,518 --> 00:32:14,517
Stephen: But I get to
graduate.

651
00:32:14,518 --> 00:32:17,517
But I get to graduate.

652
00:32:17,518 --> 00:32:22,517
And within three seconds of
sitting down lipton had, like, a

653
00:32:22,518 --> 00:32:26,517
brain aneurysm explosion and
said, "this is a serious class!"

654
00:32:26,518 --> 00:32:28,517
And I was like, "oh, my god.

655
00:32:28,518 --> 00:32:29,517
Oh, my god.

656
00:32:29,518 --> 00:32:30,517
I forgot.

657
00:32:30,518 --> 00:32:31,518
I forgot."

658
00:32:32,278 --> 00:32:34,517
Stephen: You understand you
graduated and you got to

659
00:32:34,518 --> 00:32:37,517
actually work with one of your
acting heroes.

660
00:32:37,518 --> 00:32:39,517
You got to work with deniro.

661
00:32:39,518 --> 00:32:40,517
Di.

662
00:32:40,518 --> 00:32:43,517
Stephen: Who I met and its
a little imposing.

663
00:32:43,518 --> 00:32:45,517
It is a little imposing.

664
00:32:45,518 --> 00:32:50,517
We were shooting a movie called
"dirty grandpa."

665
00:32:50,518 --> 00:32:52,517
And you could tell, he was not
going to be embarrassed about

666
00:32:52,518 --> 00:32:54,517
this one.

667
00:32:54,518 --> 00:32:59,517
<i>( Laughter )
Im never going to get a table</i>

668
00:32:59,518 --> 00:33:01,517

Like, that is out.

670
00:33:03,188 --> 00:33:07,517
Can anyway, so I got to work
with deniro in the acclaimed

Oh, man, I dont know why im
publicizing that movie here.

673
00:33:12,518 --> 00:33:16,517

Oh, yeah.

678
00:33:23,518 --> 00:33:25,517
I havent gotten the call yet.

679
00:33:25,518 --> 00:33:30,517
<i>( Laughter )
Stephen: I thought they</i>

680
00:33:30,518 --> 00:33:30,517
were.

681
00:33:30,518 --> 00:33:31,517
But go ahead, go ahead.

682
00:33:31,518 --> 00:33:34,517
I think they are.

683
00:33:34,518 --> 00:33:36,517
"Dirty grandpa in Europe."

684
00:33:36,518 --> 00:33:37,517
Super dirty.

685
00:33:37,518 --> 00:33:39,517
Stephen: Do you want to
ever work again?

686
00:33:39,518 --> 00:33:40,517
<i>( Laughter ).</i>

687
00:33:40,518 --> 00:33:43,517
Honestly, im good.

<i>( Laughter )
And not-- not money-wise.</i>

689
00:33:45,518 --> 00:33:48,517
I need the money.

690

Stephen: But youre good.

691
00:33:49,518 --> 00:33:54,517
I think im good right here
where I am.

693
00:33:54,518 --> 00:33:55,517
Stephen: So, keep going.

694
00:33:55,518 --> 00:33:56,517
Go on.

695
00:33:56,518 --> 00:33:57,517
Go on.

696
00:33:57,518 --> 00:34:00,517
So anyway --
Stephen: There is still a

697
00:34:00,518 --> 00:34:01,517
chance.

698
00:34:01,518 --> 00:34:03,517
There is still a chance I
might make it through the story.

699
00:34:03,518 --> 00:34:08,517
Stephen: There is still a
chance this will make it to air.

700
00:34:08,518 --> 00:34:09,517
No!

701
00:34:09,518 --> 00:34:11,518
Stephen: Deniro.

702
00:34:12,278 --> 00:34:13,517
Scorsese directed this one,
right?

703
00:34:13,518 --> 00:34:18,517
No, hes directed "dirty
grandpa 2."

704
00:34:18,518 --> 00:34:21,517
<i>( Laughter )
So im in a scene with deniro,</i>

705
00:34:21,518 --> 00:34:25,517
and it was the first take, and I
was trying to liven it up.

706
00:34:25,518 --> 00:34:28,517
So we did the first take and it
was a funeral scene, and he came

707
00:34:28,518 --> 00:34:33,517
over to give me a hug and I
grabbed him and I tossled his

708
00:34:33,518 --> 00:34:34,517
hair extra hard.

709
00:34:34,518 --> 00:34:35,517
And they ideal cut.

710
00:34:35,518 --> 00:34:39,517
And he was in my ear and-- I
dont do a great deniro.

711
00:34:39,518 --> 00:34:41,517
But he was like, "very funny.

712
00:34:41,518 --> 00:34:43,517
Dont do that again."

713
00:34:43,518 --> 00:34:46,517
And I was like, you know,
"okay."

714
00:34:46,518 --> 00:34:50,517
But, also, were shooting a
movie called "dirty grandpa."

715
00:34:50,518 --> 00:34:52,517
Im gonna do that again.

716
00:34:52,518 --> 00:35:03,517
<i>( Laughter )
Stephen: Damn it.</i>

717
00:35:03,518 --> 00:35:06,517
It does feel like-- it does
feel like weve met before.

718
00:35:06,518 --> 00:35:08,517
So then we did the next take.

719
00:35:08,518 --> 00:35:13,517
And he came over to give me a
hug and hes all sad and I gave

720
00:35:13,518 --> 00:35:18,517
him a hug, and I gave him a
little pat on the butt like

721
00:35:18,518 --> 00:35:19,518
athletes do.

722
00:35:20,318 --> 00:35:22,517
And after the take he came over
and said, "very funny.

723
00:35:22,518 --> 00:35:24,517
Dont ever do that again."

724
00:35:24,518 --> 00:35:27,517
Layoff laugh and I was like, "no
problem," of course.

725
00:35:27,518 --> 00:35:28,517
Stephen: Sure.

726
00:35:28,518 --> 00:35:32,517
And so then the third take he
came over to me, and I went up

727
00:35:32,518 --> 00:35:38,517
to him and I went to give him a
big hug and he saw and he pushed

728
00:35:38,518 --> 00:35:39,517
me.

729
00:35:39,518 --> 00:35:40,517
And I, like, fell back into the
stall.

730
00:35:40,518 --> 00:35:44,517
And they ideal "cut," and I went
over to him and I grabbed him,

731
00:35:44,518 --> 00:35:49,517
and I was like, "very funny,
dont ever-- dont ever do that

732
00:35:49,518 --> 00:35:50,517
again."

733

00:36:33,518 --> 00:36:34,517
Well, welcome back, everybody.

741
00:36:34,518 --> 00:36:38,517
Its August which means theres
just a little time left for

742
00:36:38,518 --> 00:36:39,517
summer fun.

743
00:36:39,518 --> 00:36:41,517
Personally, I love a good roller
coaster.

744
00:36:41,518 --> 00:36:44,517
Its the only socially
acceptable place to strap

745
00:36:44,518 --> 00:36:48,517
yourself into a exphair scream
with a group of strangers.

746
00:36:48,518 --> 00:36:52,517
When I do it at Starbucks, they
ask me to leave.

747
00:36:52,518 --> 00:36:56,517
But just because schools out
doesnt mean you cant learn new

748
00:36:56,518 --> 00:36:56,518
things.

749
00:36:57,188 --> 00:36:59,517
In fact, a roller coaster is a
perfect clam.

750
00:36:59,518 --> 00:37:00,517
Theyre so fast.

751
00:37:00,518 --> 00:37:01,517
Theyre so exciting.

752
00:37:01,518 --> 00:37:06,517
I think they keep you weak even
while learning something as dry

753
00:37:06,518 --> 00:37:08,517
as macroeconomics.

754
00:37:08,518 --> 00:37:15,517
To test that theory I invited
nobel comm Paul krugman to join

755
00:37:15,518 --> 00:37:19,517
me on the nitro roller coaster
at six flags great adventure.

756
00:37:19,518 --> 00:37:23,517
If that sounds like fun to you,
then youre not nobel

757
00:37:23,518 --> 00:37:25,517
prize-winning economist, Paul
krugman.

758
00:37:25,518 --> 00:37:29,517
Okay, Paul krugman, youre an
expert in global economic

759
00:37:29,518 --> 00:37:29,518
theory.

760
00:37:30,188 --> 00:37:31,517
Im an expert at shouting on
roller coasters.

761
00:37:31,518 --> 00:37:32,517
All right.

762
00:37:32,518 --> 00:37:36,517
Stephen: Are you ready to
explain economics to me in two

763
00:37:36,518 --> 00:37:38,517
minutes and 4gs.

764
00:37:38,518 --> 00:37:40,517
Well see how it works.

765
00:37:40,518 --> 00:37:47,517
Stephen: All right, lets
hit it.

766
00:37:47,518 --> 00:37:50,517
How long has it been sunshine
you won a nobel prize?

767
00:37:50,518 --> 00:37:51,517
Seven years.

768
00:37:51,518 --> 00:37:54,517
Stephen: So youre in a bit
of a dry spell.

769
00:37:54,518 --> 00:37:55,517
Working on it.

770
00:37:55,518 --> 00:37:57,517
Stephen: You might be a
flash in the pan.

771
00:37:57,518 --> 00:37:59,517
Yeah, you never know.

772
00:37:59,518 --> 00:38:03,517
Stephen: Why should you
help the economy in a time.

773
00:38:03,518 --> 00:38:04,517
Growth.

774
00:38:04,518 --> 00:38:06,517
Our economy right now, like this
roller coaster, is slowly going

775
00:38:06,518 --> 00:38:07,517
up.

776
00:38:07,518 --> 00:38:07,517
Theres no reason to believe it
will ever drop.

777
00:38:07,518 --> 00:38:09,517
Funny about that.

778
00:38:09,518 --> 00:38:12,517
Things do tend to go wrong now
and then --

779
00:38:12,518 --> 00:38:14,517
Stephen: Have you ever been
on a roller coaster?

780
00:38:14,518 --> 00:38:15,517
Actually, no.

781
00:38:15,518 --> 00:38:16,517
Stephen: This is your first
time ever?

782
00:38:16,518 --> 00:38:17,517
Yes.

783
00:38:17,518 --> 00:38:18,517
Stephen: Okay, youre going
to love it.

784
00:38:18,518 --> 00:38:21,517
Heres the big question for you:
Why do you think that in times

785
00:38:21,518 --> 00:38:28,517
of recession the government
should favor stimulus oifer

786
00:38:28,518 --> 00:38:28,517
austerity?

787
00:38:28,518 --> 00:38:30,517
Whats happening in a
recession...

788
00:38:30,518 --> 00:38:36,517
( Screaming )
Is that everybody is finding

789
00:38:36,518 --> 00:38:39,517
spending...

790
00:38:39,518 --> 00:38:42,517
Stephen: Yeah, but, if
youre a family and you spend

791
00:38:42,518 --> 00:38:44,517
more money than you have, thats
bad.

792
00:38:44,518 --> 00:38:50,517
How can a government spend more
money than it has?

793
00:38:50,518 --> 00:38:53,517
Do I know more about economics
than Paul krugman?

794
00:38:53,518 --> 00:38:54,518
Actually, youd be amazed.

795
00:38:54,568 --> 00:38:59,518
When you actually think about
it, families, they borrow to buy

796
00:38:59,778 --> 00:39:01,518
a house.

797
00:39:01,858 --> 00:39:06,517
Stephen: Another were
almost over.

798
00:39:06,518 --> 00:39:08,517
Just explain global
macro-economic theory?

799
00:39:08,518 --> 00:39:09,517
Should I buy gold?

800
00:39:09,518 --> 00:39:09,518
No.

801
00:39:10,188 --> 00:39:11,517
Stephen: Is it money good
or money bad?

802
00:39:11,518 --> 00:39:14,517
Money is good.

803
00:39:14,518 --> 00:39:14,517
Print much more of it.

804
00:39:14,518 --> 00:39:16,517
Stephen: Print more money.

805
00:39:16,518 --> 00:39:21,517
That brings you to where
peoples wheel warles can buy

806
00:39:21,518 --> 00:39:22,517
bread.

807
00:39:22,518 --> 00:39:24,517
Actually, no, it just brings
prosperity.

808
00:39:24,518 --> 00:39:25,517
Stephen: Okay.

809
00:39:25,518 --> 00:39:30,517
So, bottom line, it seems like
the economy is like a roller

810
00:39:30,518 --> 00:39:31,518
coaster.

811
00:39:31,688 --> 00:39:36,517
In that it goes up, it goes
down, and occasionally makes

812
00:39:36,518 --> 00:39:37,517
meantime to puke.

813
00:39:37,518 --> 00:39:41,517
Yeah, actually, me at the
moment, kind of, yes.

814
00:39:41,518 --> 00:39:43,517
Stephen: Do you think
inflation can ever be good?

815
00:39:43,518 --> 00:39:45,517
Yeah, a little bit can be
helpful.

816
00:39:45,518 --> 00:39:49,517
Stephen: So you think its
a good thing that it will cost

817
00:39:49,518 --> 00:39:52,517
us $12 to buy a photo of us on
the ride?

818
00:39:52,518 --> 00:39:55,517
No, I actually dont want a
photo of us on this ride.

819
00:39:55,518 --> 00:39:56,517

it again.
