00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:19,193
Hello there.

2
00:00:19,236 --> 00:00:21,760
Say, I'm glad to see you,

3
00:00:21,804 --> 00:00:24,328
because the folks 
who operate this theater

4
00:00:24,372 --> 00:00:26,678
have asked me 
to extend to you

5
00:00:26,722 --> 00:00:29,464
the heartiest of 
Season's Greetings.

6
00:00:29,507 --> 00:00:33,337
That includes best wishes 
for a very prosperous

7
00:00:33,381 --> 00:00:35,818
and a Happy New Year.

00:03:22,593 --> 00:03:23,986
Oh, Jesus.

37
00:03:24,029 --> 00:03:25,422
You know I wouldn't
ask if--

38
00:03:25,466 --> 00:03:27,946
I'm good for 50,
but 900 bucks?

39
00:03:27,990 --> 00:03:31,428
I got
the big problem.

40
00:03:31,472 --> 00:03:34,344
- Susan...
- I know. I know.

41
00:03:34,388 --> 00:03:35,737
I know.
I screwed up.

42
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:37,260
It's not like it's
the first time, huh?

43
00:03:37,304 --> 00:03:38,914
We were using protection,
I swear it.

44
00:03:38,957 --> 00:03:40,350
Stop.

45
00:03:40,394 --> 00:03:42,047
- What?
- Don't lie to me.

46
00:03:42,091 --> 00:03:43,397
There wasn't a hole
in the diaphragm.

47
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:44,833
The condom didn't
come off.

48
00:03:44,876 --> 00:03:46,313
It wasn't a miracle.
You just didn't bother.

49
00:03:46,356 --> 00:03:47,923
- It's Jimmy?
- Of course it's Jimmy.

50
00:03:47,966 --> 00:03:49,577
Have him
pay for it, then.

51
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:51,535
He doesn't have it.
It's you, Ray.

52
00:03:51,579 --> 00:03:53,798
- Can't ask Mom and Dad.
- No.

53
00:03:53,842 --> 00:03:54,973
Woman: 
Ordering.

54
00:03:55,017 --> 00:03:57,759
Ray.

55
00:03:57,802 --> 00:03:59,369
Go to a clinic,
a free one.

56
00:03:59,413 --> 00:04:01,023
I'm tired of bailing
you out.

57
00:04:01,066 --> 00:04:03,286
- I can't.
- No, you don't want to.

58
00:04:03,330 --> 00:04:05,375
I can't have another,
not like that.

59
00:04:05,419 --> 00:04:08,335
Last time they told me
I'm lucky even now
I can have kids.

60
00:04:08,378 --> 00:04:10,815
There's a doctor
on the East Side.

61
00:04:10,859 --> 00:04:12,643
He gives you a couple
of prescription drugs.

62
00:04:12,687 --> 00:04:14,863
They've been approved
for high blood pressure
or something.

63
00:04:14,906 --> 00:04:16,256
It's like that
French thing.

64
00:04:16,299 --> 00:04:17,692
You just miscarry.

65
00:04:17,735 --> 00:04:19,433
They're not in there
ripping you up.

66
00:04:19,476 --> 00:04:20,956
Shit.

67
00:04:20,999 --> 00:04:22,349
You know
I'm sorry, Ray.

68
00:04:22,392 --> 00:04:24,002
Come on.

69
00:04:24,046 --> 00:04:25,352
I just went Christmas
shopping, paid the rent.

70
00:04:25,395 --> 00:04:26,875
It's gonna take
a while.

71
00:04:26,918 --> 00:04:28,572
I don't have a while.
I put off asking--

72
00:04:28,616 --> 00:04:30,095
Don't push it,
all right?

73
00:04:30,139 --> 00:04:32,663
- Woman: Ray!
- Place has been dead.

74
00:04:32,707 --> 00:04:34,796
900's like a month
of tips.

75
00:04:34,839 --> 00:04:36,188
I'm in my
seventh week.

76
00:04:36,232 --> 00:04:37,668
It's gotta be done
before eight.

77
00:04:37,712 --> 00:04:39,714
- My appointment's tomorrow.
- Change it.

78
00:04:39,757 --> 00:04:41,368
He's booked.
I got in on
a cancellation--

79
00:04:41,411 --> 00:04:43,108
I don't have $900,
nowhere near it.

80
00:04:43,152 --> 00:04:44,632
Ordering!

81
00:04:44,675 --> 00:04:46,634
Okay!

82
00:04:46,677 --> 00:04:49,811
Come on.
You've loaned money to
every waiter in this town.

83
00:04:49,854 --> 00:04:51,160
Yeah, I'm a sucker.

84
00:04:51,203 --> 00:04:54,642
Collect some.
Please.

85
00:05:03,999 --> 00:05:05,957
If I can get it,
I'll bring it
to your place.

86
00:05:06,001 --> 00:05:07,524
Thank you.

87
00:05:07,568 --> 00:05:09,091
Tell Jimmy
not to be there,

88
00:05:09,134 --> 00:05:10,440
'cause when
I see him,

89
00:05:10,484 --> 00:05:12,312
I'm gonna beat his
fucking head in.

Why, it's
the devil himself.

99
00:05:30,286 --> 00:05:32,854
It's Jimmy.
You got my message.

100
00:05:32,897 --> 00:05:35,552
Yeah.
You got my number, Fatty.

101
00:05:35,596 --> 00:05:37,119
You didn't have to
call my agent.

102
00:05:37,162 --> 00:05:39,904
Well, I thought maybe
your machine was broke.

103
00:05:39,948 --> 00:05:42,211
I left messages 
you never returned.

104
00:05:42,254 --> 00:05:45,214
Actors.

105
00:05:45,257 --> 00:05:46,607
They always
call their agents.

106
00:05:46,650 --> 00:05:48,260
It's like the sun
coming up.

107
00:05:48,304 --> 00:05:50,611
It's my career, Fatty.

108
00:05:50,654 --> 00:05:52,352
It's a good thing
he thought it was funny.
If he didn't--

109
00:05:52,395 --> 00:05:55,093
What? He'd have
been upset?

110
00:05:55,137 --> 00:05:56,486
Sit down.

111
00:06:00,055 --> 00:06:01,186
You know,
I'd serve you,

112
00:06:01,230 --> 00:06:03,754
but your credit's
no good.

113
00:06:03,798 --> 00:06:06,061
Well... hey.

114
00:06:08,629 --> 00:06:11,762
100 bucks.

115
00:06:11,806 --> 00:06:13,547
You know, that's really
not what I wanted to hear.

116
00:06:13,590 --> 00:06:15,766
I'm getting the rest.

117
00:06:15,810 --> 00:06:18,334
Jimmy, I've been
so nice to you.

118
00:06:18,378 --> 00:06:20,423
I know.

119
00:06:20,467 --> 00:06:23,121
I tried
to discourage you.

120
00:06:23,165 --> 00:06:24,645
I asked you
point-blank

121
00:06:24,688 --> 00:06:26,298
if you could
afford to lose,

122
00:06:26,342 --> 00:06:27,604
and you lied
to me.

123
00:06:27,648 --> 00:06:29,258
You bet more than 
you had on the Irish.

124
00:06:29,301 --> 00:06:30,694
Now, if it had been
another team,

125
00:06:30,738 --> 00:06:33,131
I'd have collected
by now.

126
00:06:33,175 --> 00:06:35,090
But I carried you
for five weeks

127
00:06:35,133 --> 00:06:37,614
because you believed
in Notre Dame, and
I respect that.

128
00:06:37,658 --> 00:06:39,442
But you lost.

129
00:06:39,486 --> 00:06:42,271
And 500 has become
a grand.

130
00:06:42,314 --> 00:06:44,186
And you only
bring me a hundred?

131
00:06:44,229 --> 00:06:45,622
I'm getting the rest.

132
00:06:45,666 --> 00:06:49,017
Ow! Ow!
What are you doing?

133
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:52,063
Everyone's always
"getting the rest."

134
00:06:52,107 --> 00:06:53,848
You're 900 short.

135
00:06:53,891 --> 00:06:55,676
My girlfriend's getting it
from her brother.

136
00:06:55,719 --> 00:06:57,504
Oh, that's nice.

137
00:06:57,547 --> 00:06:59,070
- Yeah.
- When do I get it?

138
00:06:59,114 --> 00:07:02,117
Tomorrow.

139
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:04,380
Come on, Fatty.

140
00:07:04,424 --> 00:07:05,686
Ow.

141
00:07:05,729 --> 00:07:06,904
Tonight, Jimmy.

142
00:07:06,948 --> 00:07:08,471
And the next time
I don't bother

143
00:07:08,515 --> 00:07:09,820
taking the whiskey
out of the bottle.

144
00:07:09,864 --> 00:07:11,474
Okay. Okay.
Take it easy.

145
00:07:11,518 --> 00:07:13,128
I'll go see
my girlfriend.

146
00:07:13,171 --> 00:07:15,522
You do that... now.

147
00:07:24,661 --> 00:07:26,924
How about it,
Minor?

148
00:07:26,968 --> 00:07:28,970
You see that he's
taking care of this,

149
00:07:29,013 --> 00:07:32,277
and I'll wipe out
your tab.

150
00:07:32,321 --> 00:07:34,715
You're the man, Fatty.

151
00:07:40,634 --> 00:07:42,679
90? Damn it.

152
00:07:52,210 --> 00:07:54,648
Looks like
it might snow.

153
00:07:54,691 --> 00:07:56,084
It'll probably
just rain.

154
00:07:57,868 --> 00:08:00,567
Ray, your sister--

155
00:08:00,610 --> 00:08:02,525
I'm sorry. I couldn't
help overhearing.

156
00:08:02,569 --> 00:08:05,397
- Yeah.
- Well, I was listening.

157
00:08:05,441 --> 00:08:06,703
You have that 20
you owe me?

158
00:08:06,747 --> 00:08:08,400
Which 20?

159
00:08:08,444 --> 00:08:09,967
Twice you lent me
for the cab fare,

160
00:08:10,011 --> 00:08:12,404
and then there was
the time when we all
went out to that club.

161
00:08:12,448 --> 00:08:14,494
Any or all
would be nice.

162
00:08:14,537 --> 00:08:16,757
I just paid
the rent.

163
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,367
- Thanks, Ray.
- See you, man.

164
00:08:18,410 --> 00:08:20,021
Can you get it
from your guy?

165
00:08:20,064 --> 00:08:22,676
My "guy" Simon

166
00:08:22,719 --> 00:08:25,287
just moved
to San Francisco
with his new girlfriend.

167
00:08:25,330 --> 00:08:26,984
So, uh, no.

168
00:08:27,028 --> 00:08:28,159
Sorry.

169
00:08:28,203 --> 00:08:30,379
He owed you 40.

170
00:08:30,422 --> 00:08:32,120
But I can
give you advice.

171
00:08:32,163 --> 00:08:34,426
Yeah?

172
00:08:34,470 --> 00:08:39,519
Sometimes a whisper
is louder than a shout.

173
00:08:39,562 --> 00:08:41,390
What does that
have to do with this?

174
00:08:41,433 --> 00:08:43,305
Nothing.
I just thought

175
00:08:43,348 --> 00:08:46,700
the "neither a lender
or a borrower be" one
was a bit obvious.

176
00:08:46,743 --> 00:08:49,050
Thank you.

177
00:08:49,093 --> 00:08:50,094
Anytime.

178
00:08:50,138 --> 00:08:51,792
- Three more Amstels.
- I gotta go.

179
00:08:51,835 --> 00:08:53,445
You have that 50
you owe me?

180
00:08:53,489 --> 00:08:54,795
I thought that was
sort of a gift.

181
00:08:54,838 --> 00:08:56,666
Why would I
give you money?

182
00:08:56,710 --> 00:08:57,754
Because you love me.

183
00:08:57,798 --> 00:09:00,235
Right.
Take over the bar.

184
00:09:00,278 --> 00:09:01,584
Cindy can have
your section.

185
00:09:01,628 --> 00:09:03,368
- You got it.
- I gotta go.

186
00:09:03,412 --> 00:09:04,631
Are you going out
to collect?

187
00:09:04,674 --> 00:09:05,936
I got no choice.

188
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:08,591
- Well, I should
come with you.
- Why?

189
00:09:08,635 --> 00:09:11,072
Because you'll be going
to a lot of bars,

190
00:09:11,115 --> 00:09:12,160
no one will have
the money,

191
00:09:12,203 --> 00:09:13,640
they'll all feel
very guilty,

192
00:09:13,683 --> 00:09:15,555
so they'll be buying you
free drinks.

193
00:09:15,598 --> 00:09:17,382
And if I'm with you...

194
00:09:17,426 --> 00:09:18,645
I see.

195
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:27,436
Thank you.

196
00:09:27,479 --> 00:09:29,960
You want a hanky?

197
00:09:30,004 --> 00:09:31,222
No, I'm fine.

198
00:09:31,266 --> 00:09:33,007
Like a drowned rat.
Take it.

199
00:09:37,315 --> 00:09:39,840
You want to look pretty
when you beg your
old lady for the cash.

200
00:09:39,883 --> 00:09:41,668
I'm not gonna
have to beg.
She's getting it.

201
00:09:41,711 --> 00:09:44,061
Good. I don't want to
have to babysit you all night.

202
00:09:44,105 --> 00:09:48,022
What? Fatty thinks
I need an escort?

203
00:09:48,065 --> 00:09:51,765
Go tell him
to mop his sweat.

204
00:09:51,808 --> 00:09:54,724
You go tell him.

205
00:09:54,768 --> 00:09:56,465
Good decision.

206
00:09:56,508 --> 00:09:59,076
He didn't seem like
he was in a chatty mood.

207
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:00,991
Let's go get it.

208
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:05,430
I lost on the Irish
that week, too.

209
00:10:05,474 --> 00:10:07,345
50 fucking bucks.

210
00:10:09,739 --> 00:10:12,699
I can't believe
she's got me calling
in debts for this.

211
00:10:12,742 --> 00:10:14,657
I'm pro-choice, I am,
but I don't like it.

212
00:10:14,701 --> 00:10:16,267
Well, it's not
likeable,

213
00:10:16,311 --> 00:10:17,660
it's just sometimes
necessary.

214
00:10:17,704 --> 00:10:19,662
Well, if it was me,
I'd choose to have it.

215
00:10:19,706 --> 00:10:22,099
You know what?
It probably won't
come up.

216
00:10:22,143 --> 00:10:23,710
Fine.
Forget it.

217
00:10:23,753 --> 00:10:25,799
No, I just mean
it's easy to think
you have it

218
00:10:25,842 --> 00:10:27,322
when that can't
possibly happen.

219
00:10:27,365 --> 00:10:28,976
- You know,
that pisses me off.
- Why?

220
00:10:29,019 --> 00:10:30,455
Like women shouldn't
have been able

221
00:10:30,499 --> 00:10:31,674
to take a stand
on Vietnam

222
00:10:31,718 --> 00:10:32,675
because they couldn't
be drafted?

223
00:10:32,719 --> 00:10:33,894
That's a bit
of a jump.

224
00:10:33,937 --> 00:10:35,678
Do I know
what I'd do? No.

225
00:10:35,722 --> 00:10:37,724
Do I know what
I'd think I'd do? Yeah.

226
00:10:37,767 --> 00:10:39,682
I had a stepbrother
that went to 'Nam.

227
00:10:39,726 --> 00:10:41,162
Afterwards, all these
girls would tell him

228
00:10:41,205 --> 00:10:42,990
how they would have
gone to Canada.

229
00:10:43,033 --> 00:10:45,688
Would they have?
Maybe.

230
00:10:45,732 --> 00:10:47,385
But believe me,
if it came up at a party,

231
00:10:47,429 --> 00:10:50,475
nobody was telling them
they didn't have a right
to an opinion.

232
00:10:50,519 --> 00:10:52,129
Let's try in here.

233
00:10:52,173 --> 00:10:54,001
- There is a flaw
in your logic.
- Oh, really?

234
00:10:54,044 --> 00:10:56,743
Yeah.
And I need a drink
before I find it.

235
00:11:00,311 --> 00:11:02,705
- This is it.
- Great.

236
00:11:02,749 --> 00:11:04,446
You can't come up
with me.

237
00:11:04,489 --> 00:11:06,448
- Sure, I can.
- No, you can wait here.

238
00:11:06,491 --> 00:11:07,579
She's never gonna
give it to me

239
00:11:07,623 --> 00:11:08,755
if someone like you
is there.

240
00:11:08,798 --> 00:11:10,408
Why? She doesn't like
a face with character?

241
00:11:10,452 --> 00:11:12,193
I didn't exactly tell her
it was a gambling thing.

242
00:11:12,236 --> 00:11:14,630
Debt. It's
a gambling debt.

243
00:11:14,674 --> 00:11:16,763
Yeah. Well, I told her
it was for my sister.

244
00:11:16,806 --> 00:11:19,461
Why would she ask
her brother for 900
for your sister?

245
00:11:19,504 --> 00:11:21,550
I told her it was
a "woman thing."

246
00:11:21,593 --> 00:11:23,247
What is it with you
and this "thing" thing?

247
00:11:23,291 --> 00:11:25,597
What did you
tell her?

248
00:11:25,641 --> 00:11:26,947
An abortion.

249
00:11:26,990 --> 00:11:29,036
I told her my sister Maggie
needs an abortion.

250
00:11:29,079 --> 00:11:31,299
You really stink.

251
00:11:31,342 --> 00:11:33,736
Hey, I know it stinks,
but I'm fucked.

252
00:11:33,780 --> 00:11:36,260
If I don't pay, you guys
are gonna stomp me.

253
00:11:36,304 --> 00:11:37,697
Just get
the fucking money.

254
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:39,611
Hey, I'll get the money.
Chill.

255
00:11:39,655 --> 00:11:42,092
Hey, pagliacci,
get the fucking money.

256
00:11:48,751 --> 00:11:50,710
Jeez, Elena, I thought
your father was taking 'em.

257
00:11:50,753 --> 00:11:53,930
He's a louse, Minor.
He's back at Rikers.

258
00:11:53,974 --> 00:11:56,237
And I gotta work
on Saturday.

259
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:57,891
They're kids.

260
00:11:57,934 --> 00:11:59,675
I promised them
the circus.

261
00:11:59,719 --> 00:12:01,024
Okay, okay.

262
00:12:01,068 --> 00:12:02,678
You let me borrow
Ricky for a few hours,

263
00:12:02,722 --> 00:12:04,898
I'll do the circus.

264
00:12:04,941 --> 00:12:07,030
An errand. I just need him
for an errand, okay?

265
00:12:07,074 --> 00:12:09,598
What kind of errand?
You know it's a school night.

266
00:12:09,641 --> 00:12:11,426
I know it's
a school night, honey.

267
00:12:11,469 --> 00:12:13,602
Just put Ricky on, okay,
please, sweetie?

268
00:12:13,645 --> 00:12:15,778
Okay.

269
00:12:15,822 --> 00:12:19,303
It's Minor, for you.

270
00:12:19,347 --> 00:12:21,349
Hey, Minor,
what's up?

271
00:12:21,392 --> 00:12:23,220
Yeah.

272
00:12:23,264 --> 00:12:25,179
Uh-huh.

273
00:12:25,222 --> 00:12:26,920
Yeah, I gotcha.

274
00:12:26,963 --> 00:12:28,443
Gotcha.

275
00:12:28,486 --> 00:12:30,358
We'll be walking up
10th Avenue.

276
00:12:30,401 --> 00:12:32,099
Get my gun from
under the mattress.

277
00:12:32,142 --> 00:12:33,578
Take the bullets out.

278
00:12:33,622 --> 00:12:35,450
You're just waving it around,
making it look good.

279
00:12:35,493 --> 00:12:37,191
And don't forget, you have
to take my money, too.

280
00:12:37,234 --> 00:12:39,106
- You're a mugger.
- Oh, yeah.

281
00:12:39,149 --> 00:12:40,760
And keep three bills.

282
00:12:40,803 --> 00:12:42,805
Hey, that's a hundred more
than it's worth.

283
00:12:42,849 --> 00:12:45,286
I'm giving you a good cut
'cause I love your mom.

284
00:12:45,329 --> 00:12:47,462
All right.
See you in 20.

285
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:56,384
Does he owe you?

286
00:12:56,427 --> 00:12:59,256
Yeah.

287
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:01,128
You've got
to ask, Ray.

288
00:13:01,171 --> 00:13:02,477
No one's gonna
volunteer.

289
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:04,348
It's embarrassing.

290
00:13:04,392 --> 00:13:05,523
Okay.

291
00:13:05,567 --> 00:13:08,265
A coke for old Stingray.
And for...

292
00:13:08,309 --> 00:13:09,484
April.

293
00:13:09,527 --> 00:13:11,355
For April,
an Absolut martini, up,

294
00:13:11,399 --> 00:13:13,314
very dry, one olive.

295
00:13:13,357 --> 00:13:15,055
Mmm.

296
00:13:15,098 --> 00:13:17,405
It's perfect.

297
00:13:17,448 --> 00:13:19,842
Listen...
what's your name?

298
00:13:19,886 --> 00:13:22,018
- Cliff.
- Cliff.

299
00:13:22,062 --> 00:13:24,586
It happens to be
my birthday.

300
00:13:24,629 --> 00:13:26,283
- Oh.
- Yeah.

301
00:13:26,327 --> 00:13:28,503
And old Stingray here

302
00:13:28,546 --> 00:13:30,287
is just a little
bit short.

303
00:13:30,331 --> 00:13:34,814
So I was wondering
if you had the money
that you owe him.

304
00:13:34,857 --> 00:13:36,772
I owe you money?

305
00:13:36,816 --> 00:13:39,862
There was that
hockey game.

306
00:13:39,906 --> 00:13:43,126
Oh. Right.

307
00:13:43,170 --> 00:13:47,348
Well, jeez, I...

308
00:13:47,391 --> 00:13:50,133
I just went and bought
a tree, some lights,
and some tinsel.

309
00:13:50,177 --> 00:13:51,482
I can give you,
like, 20?

310
00:13:51,526 --> 00:13:52,875
That's great.

311
00:13:52,919 --> 00:13:54,616
Sorry I forgot.
I'll pay you the rest soon.

312
00:13:54,659 --> 00:13:56,009
It's okay.

313
00:13:56,052 --> 00:13:57,010
These drinks
are on me.

314
00:13:57,053 --> 00:13:59,012
Mmm. Thanks.

315
00:13:59,055 --> 00:14:00,796
- Happy Birthday.
- Cheers.

316
00:14:03,364 --> 00:14:05,192
Is it really
your birthday?

317
00:14:05,235 --> 00:14:07,063
Yeah, right.

318
00:14:07,107 --> 00:14:08,717
Well, that wasn't
so difficult, was it?

319
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:10,284
I hate being small
about money.

320
00:14:10,327 --> 00:14:12,373
Well, learn.

321
00:14:12,416 --> 00:14:14,723
Really.

322
00:14:14,766 --> 00:14:16,290
Jimmy: 
I can't believe 
you don't have the cash.

323
00:14:16,333 --> 00:14:17,508
He's gotta
collect it.

324
00:14:17,552 --> 00:14:19,859
Waiters are deadbeats,
honey! Come on!

325
00:14:19,902 --> 00:14:21,599
He's never
gonna get it.

326
00:14:21,643 --> 00:14:23,079
This is fucked.

327
00:14:23,123 --> 00:14:24,776
Hey, who's doing who
the favor?

328
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:26,953
Yeah, I know, I know.

329
00:14:26,996 --> 00:14:28,998
It's your stupid sister
who got herself knocked up.

330
00:14:29,042 --> 00:14:31,783
Hey, I'm sorry,
it's just I really got
to get it to her tonight.

331
00:14:31,827 --> 00:14:33,916
I thought you said
it was tomorrow.

332
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:35,570
Yeah, it's at
9:00 a.m.

333
00:14:38,355 --> 00:14:39,791
Ray's gonna bring it
by here tonight,

334
00:14:39,835 --> 00:14:42,751
and you don't wanna
be here when he shows up.

335
00:14:42,794 --> 00:14:44,492
Why not?

336
00:14:44,535 --> 00:14:46,146
Because I told him
it was me.

337
00:14:46,189 --> 00:14:47,625
"It was me" what?

338
00:14:47,669 --> 00:14:49,192
That I was pregnant.

339
00:14:49,236 --> 00:14:50,977
You told him you--?

340
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:53,240
What? What'd you
tell him that for?

341
00:14:53,283 --> 00:14:55,633
I couldn't
very well tell him
it was for Maggie.

342
00:14:55,677 --> 00:14:57,548
Since she dumped him,
she's not really
high on his list.

343
00:14:57,592 --> 00:14:59,072
Oh, man.

344
00:14:59,115 --> 00:15:00,856
Shit, she's not even
high on mine,

345
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:02,989
but it's moments like this
we have to help out anyway.

346
00:15:03,032 --> 00:15:04,686
Ray's gonna
fucking kill me.

347
00:15:04,729 --> 00:15:06,775
When I see him, I'm gonna
beat his fucking head in.

348
00:15:06,818 --> 00:15:08,516
Hey, I'm the one
who's taking the heat.

349
00:15:08,559 --> 00:15:12,302
Oh. Well, I'm sorry,
but you shouldn't have--

350
00:15:12,346 --> 00:15:14,130
I mean...

351
00:15:14,174 --> 00:15:15,653
you shouldn't
have had to.

352
00:15:15,697 --> 00:15:18,569
Come here.
Come here, baby.

353
00:15:18,613 --> 00:15:21,616
Come on. Hmm?

354
00:15:26,403 --> 00:15:28,188
I'm gonna go find Ray.
You stay.

355
00:15:28,231 --> 00:15:30,930
I'll keep calling
in case he shows, okay?

356
00:15:30,973 --> 00:15:32,453
Yeah?

357
00:15:32,496 --> 00:15:34,411
I gotta tell him
it's for Maggie.

358
00:15:34,455 --> 00:15:36,196
He's not gonna give it to you.

359
00:15:36,239 --> 00:15:38,024
Well, I'm hoping he's
so relieved that it's not you

360
00:15:38,067 --> 00:15:39,025
that begging works.

361
00:15:39,068 --> 00:15:40,852
He hates her.

362
00:15:40,896 --> 00:15:43,768
Yeah, but...

363
00:15:43,812 --> 00:15:45,901
he loves her.

364
00:16:02,570 --> 00:16:05,094
Ricky, you're not getting 
money from my purse, are you?

365
00:16:05,138 --> 00:16:06,966
No, Mom.

366
00:16:07,009 --> 00:16:09,664
And after 
you help Minor,

367
00:16:09,707 --> 00:16:12,623
you come straight home, 
you hear?

368
00:16:12,667 --> 00:16:14,974
Right there
and back, Mom.

369
00:16:15,017 --> 00:16:16,888
Boom, boom.

370
00:16:26,072 --> 00:16:27,769
April:
Will you hurry up?

371
00:16:27,812 --> 00:16:29,336
I'm not going
in there.

372
00:16:29,379 --> 00:16:31,251
She's already seen you.
Don't give her the satisfaction.

373
00:16:31,294 --> 00:16:32,904
- Shit!
- Cool it.

374
00:16:32,948 --> 00:16:34,863
It's time you put your dick
on the chopping block.

375
00:16:34,906 --> 00:16:35,907
Nice mouth.

376
00:16:35,951 --> 00:16:38,214
Yeah, I'm working on
being colorful.

377
00:16:38,258 --> 00:16:40,086

If you want me
to ask him to leave,
I will.

386
00:17:12,379 --> 00:17:13,554
No.

387
00:17:13,597 --> 00:17:15,773
I don't care.
Let him glower.

388
00:17:15,817 --> 00:17:19,429
It's just--
it's weird.

389
00:17:19,473 --> 00:17:21,388
He thought I was
an angel, you know?

390
00:17:21,431 --> 00:17:23,999
He'd actually
say it.

391
00:17:24,043 --> 00:17:25,957
I tried to convince him
it was just the way I look,

392
00:17:26,001 --> 00:17:27,655
you know, my hair.

393
00:17:27,698 --> 00:17:30,179
The way it catches
the light.

394
00:17:30,223 --> 00:17:34,227
I told him I never got to be
a wise man or a sheep or Mary,

395
00:17:34,270 --> 00:17:35,271
I was always
an angel,

396
00:17:35,315 --> 00:17:38,057
and he'd keep
saying it.

397
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:40,711
It got to be
fucking annoying.

398
00:17:40,755 --> 00:17:42,452
Tell you what,

399
00:17:42,496 --> 00:17:43,758
you let me
buy you dessert,

400
00:17:43,801 --> 00:17:46,065
I'll let you be
a wise man.

401
00:17:46,108 --> 00:17:47,805
Deal.

402
00:17:47,849 --> 00:17:50,330
27, 28, 29, 30.

403
00:17:50,373 --> 00:17:52,810
Sorry it's all
in singles.

404
00:17:52,854 --> 00:17:54,551
It's okay.
I'm sorry
to ask for it.

405
00:17:54,595 --> 00:17:56,292
Hey, I borrowed it.
Forget it.

406
00:17:56,336 --> 00:17:58,338
So, what are you drinking?

407
00:17:58,381 --> 00:18:00,122
It's on me.

408
00:18:00,166 --> 00:18:01,515
Thanks.
Just a coke.

409
00:18:01,558 --> 00:18:03,604
Stoli crystal martini,
up, very dry,

410
00:18:03,647 --> 00:18:04,866
one olive,
thank you.

411
00:18:04,909 --> 00:18:06,389
Okay.

412
00:18:06,433 --> 00:18:07,782
You're really gonna
push it, aren't you?

413
00:18:07,825 --> 00:18:10,306
Yep. Top shelf,
all the way.

414
00:18:10,350 --> 00:18:12,526
So, who else
owes you in here?

415
00:18:12,569 --> 00:18:14,267
Except for Maggie,
that's it.

416
00:18:14,310 --> 00:18:15,790
I don't even
want to ask.

417
00:18:15,833 --> 00:18:17,096
600.

418
00:18:17,139 --> 00:18:19,620
- 600?
- She was short on rent.

419
00:18:19,663 --> 00:18:21,796
Yeah, but long
on balls...

420
00:18:21,839 --> 00:18:23,841
which obviously
isn't what the two
of you had in common.

421
00:18:23,885 --> 00:18:25,278
What?

422
00:18:25,321 --> 00:18:26,322
She hangs out here?

423
00:18:26,366 --> 00:18:28,672
She's doing the owner.

424
00:18:28,716 --> 00:18:31,110
Her name's Maggie,
but you don't wanna know.

425
00:18:31,153 --> 00:18:32,937
She's a real maneater.

426
00:18:32,981 --> 00:18:34,765

You got any cigarettes
back there?

434
00:18:56,396 --> 00:18:59,312
The whole pack, yeah.
Thanks.

435
00:18:59,355 --> 00:19:02,793
Heroin?

436
00:19:02,837 --> 00:19:04,708
I'm not happy.

437
00:19:04,752 --> 00:19:06,493
Relax. I just
gotta find Ray.

438
00:19:06,536 --> 00:19:07,798
He'll give me
the money.

439
00:19:07,842 --> 00:19:09,191
For an ex-girlfriend's
abortion?

440
00:19:09,235 --> 00:19:10,540
I don't think so.

441
00:19:10,584 --> 00:19:11,933
Hey, I got no choice.

442
00:19:11,976 --> 00:19:13,326
He thinks I got
Susan pregnant,

443
00:19:13,369 --> 00:19:15,110
he's gonna
kick my ass.

444
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:16,590
He's not really
gonna mess up his
sister's boyfriend.

445
00:19:16,633 --> 00:19:18,200
But Fatty, he'll be
setting an example.

446
00:19:18,244 --> 00:19:19,462
He'll want it
to show.

447
00:19:19,506 --> 00:19:20,985
Forgive me for keeping
your butt off a barstool

448
00:19:21,029 --> 00:19:22,335
a little longer
than usual,

449
00:19:22,378 --> 00:19:24,206
but I'm trying to work this
so no one beats me up.

450
00:19:24,250 --> 00:19:25,294
It's just
the way I am.

451
00:19:25,338 --> 00:19:26,600
Excuse me,
you got the time?

452
00:19:26,643 --> 00:19:28,123
- No!
- We don't have it.

453
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:29,951
- I got a gun!
- Shit!

454
00:19:29,994 --> 00:19:31,213
Give me
your money, now!

455
00:19:31,257 --> 00:19:32,606
I-I don't have any.

456
00:19:32,649 --> 00:19:33,998
- Come on, man!
- He doesn't!

457
00:19:34,042 --> 00:19:35,739
Shut up!

458
00:19:35,783 --> 00:19:37,176
Just give me
your wallets.

459
00:19:37,219 --> 00:19:38,786
Okay. Okay.
All right.

460
00:19:38,829 --> 00:19:41,441
Here.

461
00:19:41,484 --> 00:19:43,791
Fucking
bury you both.

462
00:19:43,834 --> 00:19:45,488
We don't want any trouble.
There's not much there.

463
00:19:45,532 --> 00:19:47,403
Here. Just take it.

464
00:19:47,447 --> 00:19:48,926
Come on, man!
Where is it?

465
00:19:48,970 --> 00:19:49,927
Take off your shoes.

466
00:19:49,971 --> 00:19:51,320
That's all
there is.

467
00:19:51,364 --> 00:19:52,408
You caught us
at a bad time.

468
00:19:54,497 --> 00:19:57,108
- Really?
- That's it!

469
00:19:57,152 --> 00:19:59,850
Shit! Fucking weak!

470
00:19:59,894 --> 00:20:01,983
Better luck next time!

471
00:20:02,026 --> 00:20:03,550
Punks.

472
00:20:03,593 --> 00:20:05,900
Did you see that gun?

473
00:20:05,943 --> 00:20:07,902
- First time, huh?
- Yeah.

474
00:20:07,945 --> 00:20:09,817
Get used to it, kid.

475
00:20:09,860 --> 00:20:12,559
It's bound
to happen again.

476
00:20:17,868 --> 00:20:20,219
Hey. You can smoke 
at the bar, you know.

477
00:20:20,262 --> 00:20:23,265
I made a rule about
smoking inside.

478
00:20:23,309 --> 00:20:24,614
Sort of a step
towards quitting.

479
00:20:24,658 --> 00:20:26,790
Oh, yeah?
Is it working?

480
00:20:26,834 --> 00:20:28,836
No, but I'm spending
a lot more time outdoors.

481
00:20:28,879 --> 00:20:30,794
Great.

482
00:20:32,709 --> 00:20:34,537
You know,
I have this fantasy.

483
00:20:34,581 --> 00:20:36,060
Oh, yeah?

484
00:20:36,104 --> 00:20:38,280
If I quit,
I'll outlive her.

485
00:20:38,324 --> 00:20:39,934
And years
and years...

486
00:20:39,977 --> 00:20:42,284
and years and years
and years from now,

487
00:20:42,328 --> 00:20:44,852
I'll go
to her funeral.

488
00:20:44,895 --> 00:20:46,157
It'll be raining,

489
00:20:46,201 --> 00:20:48,812
and I'll be
the only person there.

490
00:20:48,856 --> 00:20:52,686
'Cause you were
the only one who
really loved her.

491
00:20:54,949 --> 00:20:57,299
Well, you see,
in my version,

492
00:20:57,343 --> 00:20:59,649
Simon isn't
really dead, okay?

493
00:20:59,693 --> 00:21:01,912
And he's inside
his coffin,

494
00:21:01,956 --> 00:21:04,175
and he's calling out
my name like this,

495
00:21:04,219 --> 00:21:08,136
going,
"April! April!"

496
00:21:08,179 --> 00:21:11,182
But the old,
deaf gravedigger
can't hear him,

497
00:21:11,226 --> 00:21:13,968
and he's just
shoveling on
the dirt.

498
00:21:14,011 --> 00:21:16,144
Nice twist.

499
00:21:16,187 --> 00:21:18,233
Thanks.

500
00:21:20,453 --> 00:21:21,802
You know,
you're kinda fun.

501
00:21:21,845 --> 00:21:23,064
Yeah?

502
00:21:23,107 --> 00:21:26,285
I didn't really
know that.

503
00:21:26,328 --> 00:21:29,026
Well, I don't really
have much choice.

504
00:21:29,070 --> 00:21:30,506
Yeah? Why?

505
00:21:30,550 --> 00:21:32,769
I'm a drunk.

506
00:21:32,813 --> 00:21:36,077
So I can either be
mean, pathetic...

507
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:38,079
or fun.

508
00:21:47,567 --> 00:21:50,221
Yeah.

509
00:21:50,265 --> 00:21:51,571
Well, I'm gonna
go back in.

510
00:21:51,614 --> 00:21:53,094
I'm gonna smoke
another one.

511
00:21:53,137 --> 00:21:54,574
Fine.

512
00:21:56,271 --> 00:21:58,055
Look...

513
00:21:58,099 --> 00:21:59,709
look, Mom, it's just
gonna take

514
00:21:59,753 --> 00:22:01,624
a little longer
than we thought, okay?

515
00:22:01,668 --> 00:22:03,713
Mom.

516
00:22:03,757 --> 00:22:05,715
Mom, listen--
Mom, I've called you.

517
00:22:05,759 --> 00:22:07,500
I've told you that
I'm gonna be late.

518
00:22:07,543 --> 00:22:10,154
There's nothing else
I can do. I'm sorry.

519
00:22:10,198 --> 00:22:12,200
Mom, I gotta go, okay?

520
00:22:12,243 --> 00:22:13,897
Bye. Bye.

521
00:22:22,602 --> 00:22:23,907
I'm telling you, 
Sherry,

522
00:22:23,951 --> 00:22:25,344
if Minor is up
to something,

523
00:22:25,387 --> 00:22:27,433
you can bet that
Fatty is, too,

524
00:22:27,476 --> 00:22:29,783
and Minor is definitely
up to something,

525
00:22:29,826 --> 00:22:32,089
because he knows keeping
Ricky out on a school night

526
00:22:32,133 --> 00:22:33,917
is gonna give him
a hard time with me,

527
00:22:33,961 --> 00:22:35,832
and Minor
hates a hard time
as much as anyone.

528
00:22:35,876 --> 00:22:37,094
And you know,
Sherry,

529
00:22:37,138 --> 00:22:38,879
that I can give a hard
time with the best.

530
00:22:38,922 --> 00:22:40,402
So keeping Ricky out,

531
00:22:40,446 --> 00:22:41,882
he's got
something cooking,

532
00:22:41,925 --> 00:22:44,841
and that means Fatty's
right there, Sher.

533
00:22:44,885 --> 00:22:47,714
Right there in
the kitchen with him.

534
00:22:47,757 --> 00:22:49,237
Come on, girls.

535
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:51,848
Uh-uh. Uh-huh.

536
00:22:51,892 --> 00:22:54,895
Well, I gotta get Selena
to look after the twins.

537
00:22:54,938 --> 00:22:56,375
Yeah.

538
00:22:56,418 --> 00:22:58,202
20 minutes?

539
00:22:58,246 --> 00:22:59,813
You're a real
stand-up, Sherry.

540
00:22:59,856 --> 00:23:02,293
Okay. Okay. Bye.

541
00:23:02,337 --> 00:23:03,817
Okay, muchachas,

542
00:23:03,860 --> 00:23:05,558
I'm gonna leave you
with Selena, okay?

543
00:23:05,601 --> 00:23:06,733
Yay!

544
00:23:06,776 --> 00:23:09,213
But I'm telling her
no cable movies.

545
00:23:09,257 --> 00:23:10,432
Both:
Mom!

546
00:23:10,476 --> 00:23:11,607
Don't "Mom" me.

547
00:23:11,651 --> 00:23:13,522
Come on, come on.
Let's get a move on.

548
00:23:13,566 --> 00:23:15,698
Is Ricky gonna
get in trouble?

549
00:23:15,742 --> 00:23:17,265
Oh, yeah.

550
00:23:17,308 --> 00:23:20,224
But it's nothing
compared to what
Minor's gonna get.

551
00:23:20,268 --> 00:23:21,704
Come on,
let's go.

552
00:23:21,748 --> 00:23:23,184
Minor: 
I never have 
woman trouble.

553
00:23:23,227 --> 00:23:24,838
- Jimmy: Really?
- Because I know women.

554
00:23:24,881 --> 00:23:26,274
- Oh, yeah?
- Oh, yeah.

555
00:23:26,317 --> 00:23:28,015
And knowing that,
I know you know nothing.

556
00:23:28,058 --> 00:23:29,538
Hey, I know
a few things.

557
00:23:29,582 --> 00:23:31,148
There's only one thing
you need to know.

558
00:23:31,192 --> 00:23:34,021
- What?
- Never lie to them.
That's a sucker's game.

559
00:23:34,064 --> 00:23:35,675
First you
got to remember
what you said,

560
00:23:35,718 --> 00:23:37,459
and they got a much
better memory.

561
00:23:37,503 --> 00:23:40,288
And second, it's the one
thing they don't forgive.

562
00:23:40,331 --> 00:23:41,811
And if they do forgive,
they don't forget,

563
00:23:41,855 --> 00:23:43,465
and once you lie
to them once,

564
00:23:43,509 --> 00:23:45,641
everything you say
you've got to say
about 50 times

565
00:23:45,685 --> 00:23:47,817
before they vaguely
believe you.

566
00:23:47,861 --> 00:23:49,689
And that's so tedious,
you break up.

567
00:23:49,732 --> 00:23:51,081
Jimmy:
She's forgiven me
before.

568
00:23:51,125 --> 00:23:52,518
You didn't
tell a fib.

569
00:23:52,561 --> 00:23:54,737
You told her
that your sister
needs an abortion.

570
00:23:54,781 --> 00:23:56,696
You're already
totally fucked.

571
00:23:56,739 --> 00:23:59,612
Just give
Fatty his money
and pack your bags.

572
00:23:59,655 --> 00:24:01,309
Hey, maybe you're
just a bad liar.

573
00:24:01,352 --> 00:24:03,442
I mean, I'm an actor.
I lie for a living...

574
00:24:03,485 --> 00:24:04,660
you know, sort of.

575
00:24:04,704 --> 00:24:06,270
How much money have
you made acting?

576
00:24:06,314 --> 00:24:07,402
That's not funny.

577
00:24:07,446 --> 00:24:09,926
Just asking.

578
00:24:09,970 --> 00:24:11,711
Maybe I should
try L.A.

579
00:24:11,754 --> 00:24:14,191
I'm sure they're
holding their breath.

00:24:43,394 --> 00:24:44,874
Hey yourself, Fatty.

594
00:24:44,918 --> 00:24:46,702
Whatcha got
Minor doing?

595
00:24:46,746 --> 00:24:49,139
Uh, he was in.
He, uh...

596
00:24:49,183 --> 00:24:50,489
he had some beers,
that's all.

597
00:24:50,532 --> 00:24:52,360
He left a while ago.

598
00:24:52,403 --> 00:24:54,014
That's not
what I asked you.

599
00:24:54,057 --> 00:24:57,017
Well, I'm not Minor's
keeper, honey.

600
00:24:57,060 --> 00:24:59,062
Don't "honey" me.

601
00:24:59,106 --> 00:25:01,978
When you asked
to wed me,
what did I say?

602
00:25:02,022 --> 00:25:02,979
Come on.

603
00:25:03,023 --> 00:25:04,415
What did I say?!

604
00:25:04,459 --> 00:25:05,678
You said yes.

605
00:25:05,721 --> 00:25:08,681
I said you're fat.

606
00:25:08,724 --> 00:25:11,466
And a fat man don't
get many chances
with a good woman.

607
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:15,165
So, what I says goes.

608
00:25:15,209 --> 00:25:16,776
Come on, Sherry,
you're--

609
00:25:16,819 --> 00:25:19,518
You're still fat!
Hell, you're fatter.

610
00:25:19,561 --> 00:25:22,477
So, house rules
is simple.

611
00:25:22,521 --> 00:25:24,697
Keep your big old
nose clean.

612
00:25:24,740 --> 00:25:26,525
I don't want no
goombahs coming in here

613
00:25:26,568 --> 00:25:28,178
and tossing you
into the Hudson.

614
00:25:28,222 --> 00:25:31,834
'Cause in no way am I
gonna be responsible

615
00:25:31,878 --> 00:25:33,444
for the ensuing
tidal wave.

616
00:25:33,488 --> 00:25:34,794
I told you,
Minor left.

617
00:25:34,837 --> 00:25:36,447
Don't mess with me,
Fatty.

618
00:25:36,491 --> 00:25:38,275
This isn't some
domestic dispute.

619
00:25:38,319 --> 00:25:39,712
Minor's got my kid
with him.

620
00:25:39,755 --> 00:25:42,149
And I'm like a mother lion. 
You get me?

621
00:25:42,192 --> 00:25:44,455
I really don't know nothing
about your kid. I'm sorry.

622
00:25:44,499 --> 00:25:46,196
You hear something,
I'll be home waiting.

623
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:48,024
- You call me.
- You want company?

624
00:25:48,068 --> 00:25:50,244
- Yeah, that'd be good.
- Give me a bottle
of "plonk."

625
00:25:50,287 --> 00:25:51,550
You want red
or white?

626
00:25:51,593 --> 00:25:53,856
Are you kidding, Fatty?
The white is piss.

627
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:57,773
I better not hear
different about you
knowing something, Fatty.

628
00:25:57,817 --> 00:25:59,122
You won't.

629
00:25:59,166 --> 00:26:01,037
If she does,

630
00:26:01,081 --> 00:26:03,605
you're eating salad
for a month.

631
00:26:06,477 --> 00:26:08,044
Bye, honey.

632
00:26:15,008 --> 00:26:16,618
Ha ha ha!

633
00:26:19,447 --> 00:26:21,014
How much are you guys
into me for?

634
00:26:21,057 --> 00:26:22,493
Just this drink.

635
00:26:22,537 --> 00:26:23,886
Like, nothing.
Like, 50 bucks.

636
00:26:23,930 --> 00:26:27,107
Jesus, Fatty.
I got the 50.

637
00:26:27,150 --> 00:26:28,456
Come on, give me
what you got.

638
00:26:28,499 --> 00:26:30,240
Relax, Cluck.

639
00:26:30,284 --> 00:26:33,635
I'm not
gonna beat you.

640
00:26:33,679 --> 00:26:35,158
Looking up
an address.

641
00:26:35,202 --> 00:26:37,465
Man, Cluck, I thought
you were gonna pee.

642
00:26:37,508 --> 00:26:39,685
Me, too.

643
00:26:39,728 --> 00:26:42,601
Sherry's not
fooling around.

644
00:26:42,644 --> 00:26:46,039
I want you guys
to go here.

645
00:26:46,082 --> 00:26:48,432
Find out where
this guy Jimmy is.

646
00:26:48,476 --> 00:26:49,651
Minor will be
with him.

647
00:26:49,695 --> 00:26:51,697
If you bring him back,

648
00:26:51,740 --> 00:26:54,351
I'll wipe out your debt
and give you 50.

649
00:26:55,831 --> 00:26:58,660
What's the spread on
B.C. - UMass?

650
00:26:58,704 --> 00:27:00,009
14.

651
00:27:00,053 --> 00:27:01,968
Put my 50 on that.

652
00:27:03,622 --> 00:27:07,103
Now... here's
how you work it.

653
00:27:16,243 --> 00:27:17,374
Hi. Is Jimmy home?

654
00:27:17,418 --> 00:27:18,854
We're a couple
of actor friends.

655
00:27:18,898 --> 00:27:21,030
We heard about this
great audition tomorrow.

656
00:27:21,074 --> 00:27:22,075
I'm Phil.

657
00:27:22,118 --> 00:27:23,380
I'm Clayton,

658
00:27:23,424 --> 00:27:25,165
but people
call me Cluck.

659
00:27:25,208 --> 00:27:27,210
You advertise that?

660
00:27:27,254 --> 00:27:29,343
What do you mean?

661
00:27:29,386 --> 00:27:31,475
Forget it.
Jimmy's not here.

662
00:27:31,519 --> 00:27:32,912
Uh...

663
00:27:32,955 --> 00:27:34,478
Sorry. Sorry.

664
00:27:34,522 --> 00:27:36,306
We really need
to find him.

665
00:27:36,350 --> 00:27:40,441
Yeah, this audition
tomorrow, it's big.

666
00:27:40,484 --> 00:27:41,790
It's for
Steven Spielberg.

667
00:27:41,834 --> 00:27:42,878
Big, big.

668
00:27:42,922 --> 00:27:44,271
He's looking for
an unknown.

669
00:27:44,314 --> 00:27:45,838
That's Jimmy.

670
00:27:45,881 --> 00:27:47,100
Yeah.

671
00:27:47,143 --> 00:27:48,405
So you see why
we got to find him.

672
00:27:48,449 --> 00:27:51,713
I think I read
about this.

673
00:27:51,757 --> 00:27:53,410
It's the sequel
to "Schindler's List"?

674
00:27:53,454 --> 00:27:56,326
That's it.

675
00:27:56,370 --> 00:27:59,329
"They're back!

676
00:27:59,373 --> 00:28:01,592
This time
it's personal."

677
00:28:01,636 --> 00:28:03,290
So if you could
help us...

678
00:28:03,333 --> 00:28:05,684
Sure.

679
00:28:09,339 --> 00:28:10,993
Hi. This is Susan. If this is Jimmy,

680
00:28:11,037 --> 00:28:12,429
a couple of nice
young actors

681
00:28:12,473 --> 00:28:13,822
stopped by
looking for you.

682
00:28:13,866 --> 00:28:16,390
And since something smells
funny in the apartment,

683
00:28:16,433 --> 00:28:17,913
I'm gonna go
look with them.

684
00:28:17,957 --> 00:28:20,220
If this is Ray,
I'll meet you at
the Hi-Life at closing.

685
00:28:20,263 --> 00:28:21,874
Anyone else,
leave a message.

686
00:28:23,353 --> 00:28:24,485
All right, let's go.

687
00:28:24,528 --> 00:28:26,705
Uh, you wanna
come with us?

688
00:28:26,748 --> 00:28:28,097
Two strangers?

689
00:28:28,141 --> 00:28:29,446
I think you're safe.

690
00:28:29,490 --> 00:28:31,448
How come?

691
00:28:31,492 --> 00:28:33,363
You're adorable.

692
00:28:35,496 --> 00:28:37,150
Cool.

693
00:28:48,639 --> 00:28:51,294
And he doesn't have 
the courage to ask you 
for it, you see?

694
00:28:51,338 --> 00:28:52,948
So basically,
that's the problem.

695
00:28:52,992 --> 00:28:55,342
And I was hoping...

696
00:28:55,385 --> 00:28:58,171
Excuse me. Hi.
What are you doing?

697
00:28:58,214 --> 00:28:59,476
I thought you might
freeze to death.

698
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:01,000
That would be
better than this.

699
00:29:01,043 --> 00:29:03,045
Would you cut
the drama, Ray?

700
00:29:03,089 --> 00:29:04,612
She already told me
about Susan.

701
00:29:04,655 --> 00:29:06,396
I've got a couple hundred
in my checking--

702
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:07,702
Forget it,
whatever she said, okay?

703
00:29:07,746 --> 00:29:09,008
You don't
owe me anything.

704
00:29:09,051 --> 00:29:10,487
600 smackers.

705
00:29:10,531 --> 00:29:11,575
It's not
your money, okay?

706
00:29:11,619 --> 00:29:12,576
I forgive the debt.

707
00:29:12,620 --> 00:29:14,709
No, I borrowed it,
and--

708
00:29:14,753 --> 00:29:16,450
- Forget it.
- ...and I'm gonna pay you.

709
00:29:16,493 --> 00:29:17,973
You left some CDs
at my place.

710
00:29:18,017 --> 00:29:19,845
I'm not giving them back.
We're even.

711
00:29:19,888 --> 00:29:21,585
That's not even.

712
00:29:21,629 --> 00:29:23,587
How you doing?
My name's Adrien.

713
00:29:23,631 --> 00:29:25,154
That figures.
We can leave now.

714
00:29:25,198 --> 00:29:27,287
- Don't be an asshole.
- Don't start.

715
00:29:27,330 --> 00:29:29,637
Let me get us
a round, huh?

716
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:31,595
I can make a few calls,
maybe find some cash--

717
00:29:31,639 --> 00:29:33,554
I really don't
need your help.
Thank you.

718
00:29:33,597 --> 00:29:34,947
- Susan does.
- She does.

719
00:29:34,990 --> 00:29:36,426
Right, and she's
my sister.

720
00:29:36,470 --> 00:29:38,037
So when she has a problem,
it's mine, not yours...

721
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:39,560
or yours.

00:29:49,788 --> 00:29:52,225
It's my brother's
problem, too.

727
00:29:52,268 --> 00:29:53,574
Trust me, it's the least
of his problems.

728
00:29:53,617 --> 00:29:55,054
It seems she's
trying to help.

729
00:29:55,097 --> 00:29:57,491
I can handle this,
all right?

730
00:29:57,534 --> 00:30:01,103
I still got 50 fucking bars
where people owe me money.

731
00:30:01,147 --> 00:30:03,323
Apparently the fact
that I've been a chump
for the last 10 years

732
00:30:03,366 --> 00:30:05,368
is gonna work out just fine
for my stupid sister.

733
00:30:05,412 --> 00:30:06,587
Whoa, cowboy,
calm down.

734
00:30:06,630 --> 00:30:08,545
Don't
"whoa, cowboy" me.

00:30:19,382 --> 00:30:20,644
Ray, what's
your poison?

740
00:30:20,688 --> 00:30:22,124
Oh, something Christmasy.

741
00:30:22,168 --> 00:30:24,083
How about... hemlock?

742
00:30:24,126 --> 00:30:25,867
Oh, you are such a...

743
00:30:25,911 --> 00:30:28,261
You're right. I'm sorry.
That was uncalled for.

744
00:30:28,304 --> 00:30:30,306
I hate you,
but it's not your fault.

745
00:30:30,350 --> 00:30:32,613

Be of good cheer.

750
00:30:39,098 --> 00:30:40,795
Yeah.
Fa-la-la.

751
00:30:44,538 --> 00:30:47,802
Well, I-I better pass
on that drink.

752
00:30:49,325 --> 00:30:51,980
Um, I don't know
how serious you two are,

753
00:30:52,024 --> 00:30:54,461
but, um...

754
00:30:54,504 --> 00:30:56,506
you've finished
with him, haven't you?

755
00:30:56,550 --> 00:30:58,334
I mean, there's
no second thoughts?

756
00:30:58,378 --> 00:31:00,206
Ray?

757
00:31:00,249 --> 00:31:02,425
Yeah, I just don't want
to put in the time

758
00:31:02,469 --> 00:31:03,905
if you're gonna
change your mind.

759
00:31:03,949 --> 00:31:06,038
Have a little
confidence.

760
00:31:06,081 --> 00:31:07,561
If he likes you...

761
00:31:07,604 --> 00:31:09,606
Yeah, but he'd still
have you back.

762
00:31:09,650 --> 00:31:11,347
I mean, 'cause when a guy
breaks a girl's heart,

763
00:31:11,391 --> 00:31:12,696
she never
trusts him again.

764
00:31:12,740 --> 00:31:15,743
But if she breaks his,
he's hers for life

765
00:31:15,786 --> 00:31:17,092
as a general rule.

766
00:31:17,136 --> 00:31:19,616
Do you think
that's true?

767
00:31:19,660 --> 00:31:21,836
I don't think
people break other
people's hearts.

768
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:22,924
- No?
- No.

769
00:31:22,968 --> 00:31:24,447
I mean, it may
dent it,

770
00:31:24,491 --> 00:31:25,927
but you really only
break your own.

771
00:31:25,971 --> 00:31:29,844
That's why I'm not
scared of you.

772
00:31:29,888 --> 00:31:32,673
You better catch him.
He's a fast walker.

773
00:31:32,716 --> 00:31:35,937
Yeah, thanks.
I'll go and get my coat.

774
00:31:35,981 --> 00:31:38,853
Bye.

775
00:31:38,897 --> 00:31:40,724
Ronny?

776
00:31:40,768 --> 00:31:42,074
Yes, boss?

777
00:31:42,117 --> 00:31:44,380
Give me 600
from the register,
will you, please?

778
00:31:44,424 --> 00:31:45,816
- No problem.
- Thank you.

779
00:31:45,860 --> 00:31:48,297
That's really
sweet of you,
but I can't.

780
00:31:48,341 --> 00:31:49,559
It's a loan.

781
00:31:49,603 --> 00:31:51,692
You pay your
old boyfriend back,

782
00:31:51,735 --> 00:31:53,737
and you owe
your new one.

783
00:31:53,781 --> 00:31:55,478
I've never paid
anyone back.

784
00:31:55,522 --> 00:31:57,785
Well, Ray will be
the first.

785
00:31:57,828 --> 00:31:59,874
She'll find him.

786
00:31:59,918 --> 00:32:01,397
You angel, you.

787
00:32:05,619 --> 00:32:07,926
Cluck: 
Okay, so Schindler,

788
00:32:07,969 --> 00:32:10,015
he's getting ready 
to jump off this bridge

789
00:32:10,058 --> 00:32:12,756
because the guy
from "Gandhi" didn't
make this bank deposit.

790
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:16,195
And this angel comes along
trying to earn his wings

791
00:32:16,238 --> 00:32:20,068
and shows him what
the town would be like
if he'd never lived,

792
00:32:20,112 --> 00:32:21,983
and it's really bad.

793
00:32:22,027 --> 00:32:23,202
Jesus, Cluck.

794
00:32:23,245 --> 00:32:24,812
What?

795
00:32:24,855 --> 00:32:26,553
Like she's
the one person
who's not going to know

796
00:32:26,596 --> 00:32:28,990
you're telling her
"It's A Wonderful Life."

797
00:32:29,034 --> 00:32:30,600
Well, if she didn't,
she does now.

798
00:32:30,644 --> 00:32:33,473
- I knew.
- It doesn't matter.

799
00:32:33,516 --> 00:32:34,561
You caught on
we were faking

800
00:32:34,604 --> 00:32:36,476
back at your place,
didn't you?

801
00:32:36,519 --> 00:32:39,000
Actors don't tell other
actors about auditions.

802
00:32:39,044 --> 00:32:40,784
Yeah, but
you're still here.

803
00:32:40,828 --> 00:32:42,438
I wanna know
what's going on.

804
00:32:42,482 --> 00:32:44,440
What do you guys
need Jimmy for?

805
00:32:44,484 --> 00:32:46,138
No, not Jimmy,
the guy he's with.

806
00:32:46,181 --> 00:32:48,140
This guy Minor.

807
00:32:48,183 --> 00:32:50,272
When I saw him last,
he was alone.

808
00:32:50,316 --> 00:32:52,666
It's not our problem.
We're just doing
what Fatty told us.

809
00:32:52,709 --> 00:32:54,842
Yeah, we're not
paid to think.

810
00:32:54,885 --> 00:32:56,887
What are you
paid to do?

811
00:32:56,931 --> 00:32:58,367
What, you mean,
like our real jobs?

812
00:32:58,411 --> 00:32:59,455
Yeah.

813
00:32:59,499 --> 00:33:01,457
We're
paramedics.

814
00:33:01,501 --> 00:33:02,981
Really?

815
00:33:03,024 --> 00:33:05,374
EMS.
But we're off duty.

816
00:33:05,418 --> 00:33:06,506
That's why
we're drinking.

817
00:33:06,549 --> 00:33:07,550
We wouldn't drink
on duty.

818
00:33:07,594 --> 00:33:09,596
Not even if we're
just on call.

819
00:33:09,639 --> 00:33:13,382
'Cause people's lives
are in our hands.

820
00:33:13,426 --> 00:33:14,731
It's a big
responsibility.

821
00:33:17,647 --> 00:33:19,301
April:
Oh, come on, Ebenezer.

822
00:33:19,345 --> 00:33:21,738
I just thought
it was too much money
to pass up.

823
00:33:21,782 --> 00:33:23,349
It wasn't your call
to make, was it?

824
00:33:23,392 --> 00:33:24,828
I know.
I was out of line.

825
00:33:24,872 --> 00:33:26,439
Yeah, well,
you were.

826
00:33:26,482 --> 00:33:28,223
You know I don't need
my decisions being made for me

827
00:33:28,267 --> 00:33:30,138
by some buttinski
alcoholic.

828
00:33:30,182 --> 00:33:31,705
Don't you fucking dare
call me that!

829
00:33:31,748 --> 00:33:33,185
You called yourself
an alcoholic.

830
00:33:33,228 --> 00:33:35,448
I said drunk,
not alcoholic!
I said drunk!

831
00:33:35,491 --> 00:33:37,058
Have you ever been
to an AA meeting?

832
00:33:37,102 --> 00:33:39,234
- No, I try to avoid them.
- Well, I have. Once.

833
00:33:39,278 --> 00:33:42,324
There's all these
people declaring about
their lives, right?

834
00:33:42,368 --> 00:33:45,284
They've all lost jobs,
they've wrecked cars,
shot people.

835
00:33:45,327 --> 00:33:47,025
- Is there a point?
- Yes!

836
00:33:47,068 --> 00:33:49,201
I mean, their bottom
was a hell of a lot
lower than my

837
00:33:49,244 --> 00:33:52,856
"Oh, I have a hangover
more mornings than I'd
like to" bottom!

838
00:33:52,900 --> 00:33:54,858
I don't drink
in the daytime.

839
00:33:54,902 --> 00:33:58,340
I don't sneak nips from
the vanilla extract.

840
00:33:58,384 --> 00:34:00,081
Alcoholism
is a disease.

841
00:34:00,125 --> 00:34:01,474
- I've heard that.
- Yes.

842
00:34:01,517 --> 00:34:03,998
And what I have is
a plain, old-fashioned,

843
00:34:04,042 --> 00:34:05,782
self-destructive
streak.

844
00:34:05,826 --> 00:34:07,784
- You call it what you like.
- I'm calling it what it is.

845
00:34:07,828 --> 00:34:10,004
And is the irony
of a bartender

846
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:12,876
lecturing on the evils of
alcohol completely lost on you?

847
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:14,313
It's sort of like
a man being pro-life.

848
00:34:14,356 --> 00:34:16,097
I am not pro-life.

849
00:34:16,141 --> 00:34:18,099
Well, you won't
swallow a little pride
to help your sister.

850
00:34:18,143 --> 00:34:20,101
This is not about me.

851
00:34:20,145 --> 00:34:21,494
This is about you
going up to a woman
who broke my heart

852
00:34:21,537 --> 00:34:23,148
and asking her
for the money that
she owes me.

853
00:34:23,191 --> 00:34:25,585
Me, not you!
My money!

854
00:34:25,628 --> 00:34:28,109
This is about you making
me look like dirt.

855
00:34:28,153 --> 00:34:29,893
Oh, sorry. I thought
this was about

856
00:34:29,937 --> 00:34:32,113
your sister needing
an abortion!

857
00:34:32,157 --> 00:34:34,115
Okay. Great.

858
00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:37,075
Okay. I'm going
in here now

859
00:34:37,118 --> 00:34:38,380
to collect some money.

860
00:34:38,424 --> 00:34:39,816
And then I'm gonna go
to a dozen other places

861
00:34:39,860 --> 00:34:41,079
where I'd rather not
see you.

862
00:34:41,122 --> 00:34:42,341
So why don't you take
your neverending thirst

863
00:34:42,384 --> 00:34:44,125
back to Amsterdam's,
all right?

864
00:34:44,169 --> 00:34:45,822
Cliff thinks
it's your birthday.

865
00:34:45,866 --> 00:34:47,563
Maybe you'll get a few more
free cocktails out of him.

866
00:34:47,607 --> 00:34:49,130
- Thank you.
- Good.

867
00:34:49,174 --> 00:34:52,046
- That's a lovely idea.
- Good.

868
00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:53,830
Asshole!

869
00:34:53,874 --> 00:34:55,484
You know...

870
00:35:09,324 --> 00:35:12,327
I've been in
a bit of a rut just
going to Fatty's.

871
00:35:12,371 --> 00:35:13,807
There's more
to life, eh?

872
00:35:13,850 --> 00:35:15,374
I'm so glad
I'm opening you up

873
00:35:15,417 --> 00:35:18,725
to a whole new world
of Irish bars.

874
00:35:18,768 --> 00:35:20,814
Tell Ray I'll be at
Hi-Life at closing.

875
00:35:22,381 --> 00:35:23,773
Hey!

876
00:35:23,817 --> 00:35:26,298
Why, if it isn't
my brother,
the sperminator.

877
00:35:26,341 --> 00:35:27,951
Oh, man!
How'd you hear?

878
00:35:27,995 --> 00:35:30,258
Ray's out collecting
old debts to help Susan.

879
00:35:30,302 --> 00:35:31,955
I'm looking
for him.

880
00:35:31,999 --> 00:35:34,958
Oh, and he's also
planning on beating
your face in.

881
00:35:35,002 --> 00:35:36,351
Oh-hh.

882
00:35:36,395 --> 00:35:38,005
Listen,
when you see Susan,

883
00:35:38,048 --> 00:35:40,355
don't mention this
whole situation, okay?

884
00:35:40,399 --> 00:35:41,704
Why?

885
00:35:41,748 --> 00:35:43,924
It's just that
she looks up to you.

886
00:35:43,967 --> 00:35:45,491
I think it would
really bother her

887
00:35:45,534 --> 00:35:47,188
you knowing that
we screwed up.

888
00:35:47,232 --> 00:35:48,581
She looks up to me?

889
00:35:48,624 --> 00:35:50,452
Yeah, sure.
Your...

890
00:35:50,496 --> 00:35:52,193
your fashion sense.

891
00:35:52,237 --> 00:35:54,674
What's going on, Jimmy?

892
00:35:54,717 --> 00:35:56,893
Just do me this favor,
please?

893
00:35:56,937 --> 00:35:59,809
I've already done that
"you owe me for life"
favor.

894
00:35:59,853 --> 00:36:02,203
Sis, you are beautiful!
You got the money.

895
00:36:02,247 --> 00:36:04,858
Mm-hmm.
Six whole Ben Franks.

896
00:36:04,901 --> 00:36:06,164
Ray's getting
the rest.

897
00:36:06,207 --> 00:36:07,513
Great.

898
00:36:07,556 --> 00:36:09,384
What makes you think
I'll give it to you?

899
00:36:09,428 --> 00:36:11,212
I don't know.
It is for Susan.

900
00:36:11,256 --> 00:36:13,258
I just thought I'd save you
the trip down to Chelsea.

901
00:36:13,301 --> 00:36:15,782
I'm not
going to Chelsea.
I'm gonna pay back Ray.

902
00:36:15,825 --> 00:36:17,218
What's the dif?

903
00:36:17,262 --> 00:36:18,915
Ray's gonna give it to
his sister anyway.

904
00:36:18,959 --> 00:36:20,265
Who are you?

905
00:36:20,308 --> 00:36:21,962
I don't mean anything.
It's just that you seem

906
00:36:22,005 --> 00:36:23,659
like you've been through
a lot of trouble,

907
00:36:23,703 --> 00:36:24,965
and now the kid's
trying to be helpful.

908
00:36:25,008 --> 00:36:26,314
Yeah.

909
00:36:26,358 --> 00:36:28,011
Your help I don't need.
Yours either.

910
00:36:28,055 --> 00:36:29,274
Hey, I'm not
a part of this.

911
00:36:29,317 --> 00:36:31,014
- I don't need
your attitude.
- What?

912
00:36:31,058 --> 00:36:33,452
Just watch your tone,
that's all I'm saying.

913
00:36:33,495 --> 00:36:35,236
Why don't you just
butt the fuck out?

914
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:36,106
See you
at Christmas.

915
00:36:36,150 --> 00:36:38,457
Sweet girl.

916
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:41,155
Man, do you think
she's gonna tell my parents
about the abortion thing?

917
00:36:41,199 --> 00:36:42,765
How would I know?

918
00:36:42,809 --> 00:36:44,898
That "See you at Christmas"
sounded like a threat.

919
00:36:44,941 --> 00:36:46,595
Absolutely.
If she'd added
"Happy New Year,"

920
00:36:46,639 --> 00:36:50,077
I'd be leaving
the country.
Come on.

921
00:37:00,392 --> 00:37:02,394
Hey!

922
00:37:02,437 --> 00:37:04,222
Hey! Ray!

923
00:37:04,265 --> 00:37:05,527
Hey. Kristy.

924
00:37:05,571 --> 00:37:08,530
Hi yourself, stranger.
What are you doing?

925
00:37:08,574 --> 00:37:10,358
Just out walking.

926
00:37:10,402 --> 00:37:12,317
Well, come inside.
We closed early.

927
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:13,666
We're doing staff
Christmas--

928
00:37:13,709 --> 00:37:14,928
Oh, boy.

929
00:37:14,971 --> 00:37:16,669
Frankie's getting us
loaded on fine wine.

930
00:37:16,712 --> 00:37:17,887
I don't want
to crash.

931
00:37:17,931 --> 00:37:20,455
- Pshaw.
- Pshaw?

932
00:37:20,499 --> 00:37:22,065
You know
you're welcome.

933
00:37:22,109 --> 00:37:25,155
Jesus. You're like
the son she never had.

934
00:37:25,199 --> 00:37:26,896
I'm out calling in
some old debts. I'm...

935
00:37:26,940 --> 00:37:28,811
Come in, Ray.

936
00:37:28,855 --> 00:37:31,945
Where are you gonna find
more people who owe you
than here?

937
00:37:31,988 --> 00:37:34,600
It'd be like an early
present for Frankie.

938
00:37:34,643 --> 00:37:36,602
Come on.

939
00:37:36,645 --> 00:37:39,300
Do you know
about your hat?

940
00:37:39,344 --> 00:37:41,737
The design
or the tilt?

941
00:37:41,781 --> 00:37:43,609
Swirl.
Check the legs.

942
00:37:43,652 --> 00:37:45,306
Very good.
Very good.

943
00:37:45,350 --> 00:37:47,395
Now, waft.

944
00:37:47,439 --> 00:37:50,398
Waft. Savor
the bouquet.

945
00:37:50,442 --> 00:37:51,921
Mmm. Any impressions?

946
00:37:51,965 --> 00:37:53,271
Cherry?

947
00:37:53,314 --> 00:37:54,533
Put it in wine talk.

948
00:37:54,576 --> 00:37:55,969
"Subtle cherry
overtones"?

949
00:37:56,012 --> 00:37:57,840
Ah! Very good.
Very good.

950
00:37:57,884 --> 00:37:59,625
Now sip.

951
00:38:02,323 --> 00:38:04,978
Let it float
on the palate.

952
00:38:05,021 --> 00:38:07,807
All right.

953
00:38:07,850 --> 00:38:09,330
Henry,
you're dribbling.

954
00:38:09,374 --> 00:38:10,331
Sorry.

955
00:38:10,375 --> 00:38:12,420
Concentrate,
everyone.

956
00:38:12,464 --> 00:38:16,119
Oh! The prodigal
grump returns.

957
00:38:16,163 --> 00:38:17,686
Hello, Frankie.

958
00:38:17,730 --> 00:38:20,602
- "Hello, Frankie"!
- What's up, Ray?

959
00:38:20,646 --> 00:38:23,953
Hellos I get all day.
I need a hug!

960
00:38:23,997 --> 00:38:25,085
Ah!

961
00:38:27,217 --> 00:38:30,133
Can we, um,
spit yet?

962
00:38:30,177 --> 00:38:31,352
Oh, don't be such
a good girl.

963
00:38:31,396 --> 00:38:32,353
It's the holidays.
Swallow.

964
00:38:34,964 --> 00:38:36,357
How you doing,
handsome?

965
00:38:36,401 --> 00:38:38,533
That good, huh?

966
00:38:38,577 --> 00:38:39,404
Let's retire
to table four.

967
00:38:39,447 --> 00:38:41,014
Uh, I should really--

968
00:38:41,057 --> 00:38:43,190
No, you really should
resign yourself

969
00:38:43,233 --> 00:38:44,626
to the fact that
they just placed

970
00:38:44,670 --> 00:38:47,063
an outstanding
Cabernet

971
00:38:47,107 --> 00:38:49,805
and a sympathetic ear
in your path.

972
00:38:49,849 --> 00:38:51,807
Hmm?
Come on.

973
00:38:54,854 --> 00:38:57,291
Now, you really should
borrow the money from me.

974
00:38:57,335 --> 00:38:58,814
I know--
I know you won't.

975
00:38:58,858 --> 00:39:00,381
So, what else?

976
00:39:00,425 --> 00:39:03,558
You really are
a nosy parker.

977
00:39:03,602 --> 00:39:06,126
Oh, good try.
Come on, spill.

978
00:39:06,169 --> 00:39:07,867
Nothing. I just...

979
00:39:07,910 --> 00:39:10,173
This girl,
she tried to help me,
I yelled at her.

980
00:39:10,217 --> 00:39:13,960
It really was none
of her business,
but she's...

981
00:39:14,003 --> 00:39:15,004
British.

982
00:39:15,048 --> 00:39:17,050
And?

983
00:39:17,093 --> 00:39:19,052
Maybe they have
different rules for
that kind of thing.

984
00:39:19,095 --> 00:39:20,923
I'm sure they do.

985
00:39:24,187 --> 00:39:26,755
Go on.
Go on.

986
00:39:26,799 --> 00:39:28,540
Well, I was letting her
help me collect--

987
00:39:28,583 --> 00:39:30,193
well, she...

988
00:39:30,237 --> 00:39:31,194
I was glad she was
helping me.

989
00:39:31,238 --> 00:39:33,327
She was the only...

990
00:39:33,371 --> 00:39:35,155
And then...
I don't know.

991
00:39:35,198 --> 00:39:37,200
She went too far.

992
00:39:37,244 --> 00:39:38,593
I made a little scene
in the restaurant.

993
00:39:38,637 --> 00:39:41,204
Another one
out on the street.

994
00:39:41,248 --> 00:39:42,989
My, my.
How were the scenes?

995
00:39:43,032 --> 00:39:44,294
Lots of arm waving,
shouting?

996
00:39:44,338 --> 00:39:45,774
- Yeah.
- Was wine tossed?

997
00:39:45,818 --> 00:39:47,036
- No.
- Good.

998
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:51,127
I appreciate the drama,
but I abhor the waste.

999
00:39:51,171 --> 00:39:52,607
Why, that's
not too bad.

1000
00:39:52,651 --> 00:39:54,566
You were well within
the limits of a...

1001
00:39:54,609 --> 00:39:56,219
of a lover's spat.

1002
00:39:56,263 --> 00:39:57,612
She's not my lover.

1003
00:39:57,656 --> 00:39:59,962
Well, she's obviously
your something.

1004
00:40:00,006 --> 00:40:01,137
I know you.

1005
00:40:01,181 --> 00:40:03,705
You're not given
to arm waving in public.

1006
00:40:03,749 --> 00:40:06,404
She's a customer.

1007
00:40:06,447 --> 00:40:08,362
So we're friendly.

1008
00:40:08,406 --> 00:40:09,972
She's in a lot.
She drinks a lot,

1009
00:40:10,016 --> 00:40:11,931
but she leaves before
she gets sloppy,
so we're all right.

1010
00:40:11,974 --> 00:40:13,672
Oh. Does she
get sloppy?

1011
00:40:13,715 --> 00:40:16,675
I don't know.

1012
00:40:18,111 --> 00:40:19,895
She can drink
a lot.

1013
00:40:19,939 --> 00:40:22,202
Double espresso,
please.

1014
00:40:22,245 --> 00:40:23,290
Here
or to go?

1015
00:40:23,333 --> 00:40:25,423
- Um, to go.
- Okay.

1016
00:40:25,466 --> 00:40:26,424
Do you have
a ladies' room?

1017
00:40:26,467 --> 00:40:27,816
Yeah, it's unisex.
It's in back.

1018
00:40:27,860 --> 00:40:29,775
Fine.

1019
00:40:45,878 --> 00:40:48,707
Frankie: 
Oh, I see people in love 
in here all the time.

1020
00:40:48,750 --> 00:40:50,186
They either rush
through their meals

1021
00:40:50,230 --> 00:40:52,493
so they can get
back home and get
into the sack again,

1022
00:40:52,537 --> 00:40:55,365
or else they
linger over it,
and it gets cold,

1023
00:40:55,409 --> 00:40:57,019
and they tie up
the table all night.

1024
00:40:57,063 --> 00:40:58,456
But still...

1025
00:40:58,499 --> 00:41:00,936
still I love
love!

1026
00:41:00,980 --> 00:41:03,417
Okay.
Enough with the love.

1027
00:41:03,461 --> 00:41:05,245
So you ready for
some more wisdom?

1028
00:41:05,288 --> 00:41:06,289
Well, you're
full of it.

1029
00:41:06,333 --> 00:41:07,682
C'est vrai!

1030
00:41:07,726 --> 00:41:09,510
Which is French
for "that's true."

1031
00:41:09,554 --> 00:41:11,947
You know, it also
sounds curiously
enough like

1032
00:41:11,991 --> 00:41:13,514
"Save Ray,"

1033
00:41:13,558 --> 00:41:15,124
which is one of my
missions in life,

1034
00:41:15,168 --> 00:41:17,344
so here goes.

1035
00:41:17,387 --> 00:41:19,520
Surprise yourself.

1036
00:41:19,564 --> 00:41:21,304
Don't be too
certain you know
what the truth is.

1037
00:41:21,348 --> 00:41:22,392
What does that
mean?

1038
00:41:22,436 --> 00:41:23,611
Well, you're
a decider

1039
00:41:23,655 --> 00:41:25,308
about people,
about situations,

1040
00:41:25,352 --> 00:41:27,746
about your own
feelings.

1041
00:41:27,789 --> 00:41:30,009
Keep yourself
open to the fact
that sometimes--

1042
00:41:30,052 --> 00:41:32,533
sometimes
you might be wrong.

1043
00:41:32,577 --> 00:41:34,361
Okay, that's 20
from Henry.

1044
00:41:34,404 --> 00:41:35,449

Uh, they're

1048
00:41:41,586 --> 00:41:44,502

caroled in days!

you're gonna have
to stick with the story

1063
00:42:25,499 --> 00:42:26,979
you're girlfriend's
pregnant.

1064
00:42:27,022 --> 00:42:28,546
I told you,
Ray will kill me.

1065
00:42:28,589 --> 00:42:29,808
Yeah, but how are
you gonna tell him
the money's for Maggie

1066
00:42:29,851 --> 00:42:31,636
when she's the one
who gave it to him?

1067
00:42:31,679 --> 00:42:32,898
- Jimmy: Shit.
- You're welcome.

1068
00:42:32,941 --> 00:42:34,726
Give me your
fucking money!

1069
00:42:34,769 --> 00:42:36,902
You?

1070
00:42:36,945 --> 00:42:38,512
What do you mean no?

1071
00:42:38,556 --> 00:42:40,253
How many times do I got
to fucking rob you, man?

1072
00:42:40,296 --> 00:42:41,602
I got school
tomorrow.

1073
00:42:41,646 --> 00:42:42,734
What the fuck
is this?

1074
00:42:42,777 --> 00:42:43,952
Some kind of
retard mugger.

1075
00:42:43,996 --> 00:42:46,912
Oh, I'm a retard?
Oh, okay.

1076
00:42:46,955 --> 00:42:48,566
Listen, why don't you
just do it yourself?

1077
00:42:48,609 --> 00:42:50,306
Hey! Put your
fucking hands up!

1078
00:42:50,350 --> 00:42:51,656
Come on!
Both of you!

1079
00:42:51,699 --> 00:42:53,309
Hands up!

1080
00:42:53,353 --> 00:42:54,267
There's no bullets,
Jimmy.

1081
00:42:55,398 --> 00:42:56,878
You were
setting me up?

1082
00:42:56,922 --> 00:42:58,619
It was
easy money.

1083
00:42:58,663 --> 00:42:59,838
I would have backed
your mugging story,

1084
00:42:59,881 --> 00:43:01,404
and Fatty would have
given you another week.

1085
00:43:01,448 --> 00:43:03,885
Oh, like I can come up
with another 900 bucks.

1086
00:43:03,929 --> 00:43:06,018
Yeah, you've been taking
long enough coming up
with this one.

1087
00:43:06,061 --> 00:43:07,019
Shut up!

1088
00:43:07,062 --> 00:43:08,237
There's no bullets.

1089
00:43:08,281 --> 00:43:09,587
You're pointing
a paperweight, Jimmy.

1090
00:43:09,630 --> 00:43:11,501
- Stay back.
- Hey, no harm, no foul.

1091
00:43:11,545 --> 00:43:13,025
Just give me the gun.
We'll go find Ray.

1092
00:43:13,068 --> 00:43:14,417
Stay the fuck back!

1093
00:43:14,461 --> 00:43:16,158
Jimmy, you're
wasting precious-- ow!

1094
00:43:16,202 --> 00:43:17,769
Aah!

1095
00:43:17,812 --> 00:43:19,205
Minor--!

1096
00:43:19,248 --> 00:43:21,947
I told you to take out
the fucking bullets!

1097
00:43:21,990 --> 00:43:23,818
I did.

1098
00:43:23,862 --> 00:43:25,994
Well, you didn't do
a very good job!

1099
00:43:27,256 --> 00:43:28,475
Uh-hh!

1100
00:43:28,518 --> 00:43:31,652
My face.
It's bleeding.

1101
00:43:31,696 --> 00:43:33,654
I got two auditions
next week.

1102
00:43:33,698 --> 00:43:37,484
Hey, asshole.
You just shot me.

1103
00:43:37,527 --> 00:43:40,139
- I told you to stop.
- I know.

1104
00:43:40,182 --> 00:43:43,577
I just don't want
to hear about your fucking 
acting career!

1105
00:43:43,621 --> 00:43:46,406
Guys, this is ill.
I'm going home.

1106
00:43:46,449 --> 00:43:48,147
Go to Amsterdam.
Get us a cab.

1107
00:43:48,190 --> 00:43:49,409
Yeah, I'll
send one down.

1108
00:43:49,452 --> 00:43:50,889
Don't send one,
bring one.

1109
00:43:50,932 --> 00:43:53,021
No one's gonna stop
for two bleeding guys.

1110
00:43:53,065 --> 00:43:55,067
Come on, Minor.
Mom's probably already
having a cow.

1111
00:43:55,110 --> 00:43:57,330
Just get
the fucking cab.

1112
00:43:59,071 --> 00:44:00,420
I'm sorry about that.

1113
00:44:00,463 --> 00:44:01,813
I should have known Dumbo

1114
00:44:01,856 --> 00:44:04,337
would forget to check
the chamber.

1115
00:44:04,380 --> 00:44:06,556
- Hey, are you okay?
- Ricky: Taxi!

1116
00:44:06,600 --> 00:44:07,862
You're not gonna die
or something?

1117
00:44:07,906 --> 00:44:09,908
No.

1118
00:44:09,951 --> 00:44:12,519
You can add to
your list a false,
rotten, fucking shot.

1119
00:44:12,562 --> 00:44:16,131
Oh, jeez, the kid
gets a gypsy cab.

1120
00:44:18,177 --> 00:44:19,831
Elena: 
I got to admit,

1121
00:44:19,874 --> 00:44:22,094
it's kinda nice 
to have a night off 
from the kids.

1122
00:44:22,137 --> 00:44:25,227
Why do you
call him Fatty,

1123
00:44:25,271 --> 00:44:27,099
you know, instead
of Arthur?

1124
00:44:27,142 --> 00:44:29,405
Have you looked
at the man?

1125
00:44:29,449 --> 00:44:31,669
No, really.

1126
00:44:31,712 --> 00:44:33,540
I don't know.

1127
00:44:33,583 --> 00:44:34,628
Why do you call him
Minor?

1128
00:44:34,672 --> 00:44:36,935
Because he won't
marry me.

1129
00:44:36,978 --> 00:44:39,589
When he marries me,
I'll give him the respect

1130
00:44:39,633 --> 00:44:41,722
of using his
first name.

1131
00:44:41,766 --> 00:44:44,725
Mm. Taking
the hard line.

1132
00:44:44,769 --> 00:44:47,597
I don't know if I'd want to be
calling my husband Fatty,

1133
00:44:47,641 --> 00:44:50,165
even if everybody
else does.

1134
00:44:50,209 --> 00:44:53,691
To tell you
the truth,

1135
00:44:53,734 --> 00:44:57,390
I have problems
with my soft "Rs."

1136
00:44:57,433 --> 00:44:59,522
You know-- "Awh-thuh."

1137
00:44:59,566 --> 00:45:02,264
Oh. I see.

1138
00:45:02,308 --> 00:45:03,831
Yeah.

1139
00:45:03,875 --> 00:45:05,485
You want to marry Minor,
don't you?

1140
00:45:05,528 --> 00:45:07,182
Yeah.

1141
00:45:07,226 --> 00:45:09,271
I got my first one
annulled,

1142
00:45:09,315 --> 00:45:12,144
you know, so I can still get
married without going to hell.

1143
00:45:12,187 --> 00:45:13,667
Get out.

1144
00:45:13,711 --> 00:45:15,974
I had to run, like,
a thousand bake sales

1145
00:45:16,017 --> 00:45:18,324
before Father Ortiz would help
me get that one cancelled.

1146
00:45:18,367 --> 00:45:21,936
Wow.
You've been working.

1147
00:45:21,980 --> 00:45:23,938
I love him.

1148
00:45:25,940 --> 00:45:29,291
And he's real good
with the kids.

1149
00:45:29,335 --> 00:45:30,466
So were you born
a fuck-up,

1150
00:45:30,510 --> 00:45:31,772
or did your mother
raise you that way?

1151
00:45:31,816 --> 00:45:33,121
Cab driver: Come on, man, where to?

1152
00:45:33,165 --> 00:45:35,123
St. Luke's.

1153
00:45:35,167 --> 00:45:36,472
You got a meter?

1154
00:45:36,516 --> 00:45:38,039
No, man.

1155
00:45:38,083 --> 00:45:39,301
Five bucks.

1156
00:45:39,345 --> 00:45:41,042
No way, man.

1157
00:45:41,086 --> 00:45:42,609
Eight.
And that's a bargain.

1158
00:45:42,652 --> 00:45:44,785
This is why I hate
fucking gypsy cabs.

1159
00:45:44,829 --> 00:45:46,265
I make this trip three
or four times a week.

1160
00:45:46,308 --> 00:45:47,570
It's always five bucks.

1161
00:45:47,614 --> 00:45:49,921
- Bullshit.
- Every time.

1162
00:45:49,964 --> 00:45:51,749
And are you
bleeding every time?

1163
00:45:51,792 --> 00:45:53,968
Who do you think has got
to clean up back there?

1164
00:45:54,012 --> 00:45:56,449
Yeah, like this has been
cleaned in your lifetime.

1165
00:45:56,492 --> 00:45:58,625
We'll pay the eight.
We'll pay the eight.

1166
00:45:58,668 --> 00:45:59,974
I ain't getting 
fucking ripped off.

1167
00:46:00,018 --> 00:46:01,410
Give me my wallet.

1168
00:46:01,454 --> 00:46:03,412
- I tossed it.
- What?

1169
00:46:03,456 --> 00:46:04,892
Don't freak, man.

1170
00:46:04,936 --> 00:46:06,589
I got your cash
and your cards.

1171
00:46:06,633 --> 00:46:08,156
What'd you toss
my wallet for?

1172
00:46:08,200 --> 00:46:10,332
I was mugging you.
You said make it look real.

1173
00:46:10,376 --> 00:46:11,986
Who was watching?

1174
00:46:12,030 --> 00:46:14,162
Who was watching you,
you were making it real for?

1175
00:46:14,206 --> 00:46:16,382
I was just doing
what you told me.

1176
00:46:16,425 --> 00:46:18,819
That was lambskin.

1177
00:46:18,863 --> 00:46:21,256
- You got my stuff?
- You didn't have anything.

1178
00:46:21,300 --> 00:46:22,344
How can you live
without credit cards?

1179
00:46:22,388 --> 00:46:24,694
My bank card.
My SAG card.

1180
00:46:24,738 --> 00:46:25,826
Forget it.

1181
00:46:25,870 --> 00:46:27,175
We've got to get
our stories straight.

1182
00:46:27,219 --> 00:46:29,830
Nobody keeps
their wallets.

1183
00:46:29,874 --> 00:46:31,876
Since I'm shot, the doctor
will bring in the police.

1184
00:46:31,919 --> 00:46:33,486
So we were mugged,

1185
00:46:33,529 --> 00:46:35,575
and the punk was wearing
a ski mask, you got that?

1186
00:46:35,618 --> 00:46:38,012
"He was wearing
a ski mask, Officer."

1187
00:46:38,056 --> 00:46:39,971
This way, we don't have 
to look at mug shots.

1188
00:46:40,014 --> 00:46:41,929
We'll be patched up and be
right back on the street.

1189
00:46:41,973 --> 00:46:43,670
There was a struggle.

1190
00:46:43,713 --> 00:46:46,499
The punk hit you,
shot me and ran.

1191
00:46:46,542 --> 00:46:48,675
Now give Dillinger there
the gun.

1192
00:46:48,718 --> 00:46:50,808
Oh, I tossed it in
those trash cans.

1193
00:46:50,851 --> 00:46:52,200
What?

1194
00:46:52,244 --> 00:46:53,985
You know,
ditching the weapon.

1195
00:46:54,028 --> 00:46:57,162
Shit. You two have
absolutely no knack
for this, do you?

1196
00:46:57,205 --> 00:46:59,686
Pull over 
a sec.

1197
00:46:59,729 --> 00:47:01,427
Minor:
You're gonna have to
go back and get the gun.

1198
00:47:01,470 --> 00:47:03,472
- Ricky: Why?
- It's registered
in my name.

1199
00:47:03,516 --> 00:47:04,865
I'm not supposed to
leave it in alleys.

1200
00:47:04,909 --> 00:47:06,693
Yeah, but why me?
He left it.

1201
00:47:06,736 --> 00:47:09,174
'Cause you're the only one
who's not bleeding, all right?

1202
00:47:09,217 --> 00:47:10,523
Now, make sure 
nobody's around,

1203
00:47:10,566 --> 00:47:12,003
then take it 
back home.

1204
00:47:12,046 --> 00:47:13,874
No way. Mom's gonna be
hugging me and yelling,

1205
00:47:13,918 --> 00:47:15,397
and she'll find it.

1206
00:47:15,441 --> 00:47:16,703
Where's this guy
Ray work?

1207
00:47:16,746 --> 00:47:19,053
Hi-Life.
83rd and Amsterdam.

1208
00:47:19,097 --> 00:47:21,229
We'll meet you
at the Hi-Life,
soon as possible.

1209
00:47:21,273 --> 00:47:23,231
83rd and Amsterdam.

1210
00:47:23,275 --> 00:47:25,059
Mom's gonna
kill us both.

1211
00:47:27,018 --> 00:47:30,108
His mama got
the right idea.

1212
00:47:30,151 --> 00:47:31,587
Do you want a tip or not?

1213
00:47:36,418 --> 00:47:38,943
- Man.
- What?

1214
00:47:38,986 --> 00:47:40,727
I just can't believe
I shot someone.

1215
00:47:40,770 --> 00:47:42,642
Tell me about it.

1216
00:47:42,685 --> 00:47:44,122
It's not something that
I ever thought I'd do,

1217
00:47:44,165 --> 00:47:47,125
you know, except on
TV or something.

1218
00:47:47,168 --> 00:47:48,822
Yeah, well, try not
to do it again.

1219
00:47:51,085 --> 00:47:53,958
This is gonna make
an excellent sense-memory
kind of thing.

1220
00:47:54,001 --> 00:47:57,265
Look who's
Harvey Keitel. Ha ha.

1221
00:47:57,309 --> 00:48:00,181
All right.

1222
00:48:03,489 --> 00:48:05,447
Merry Christmas!

1223
00:48:05,491 --> 00:48:06,579
Hi.

1224
00:48:06,622 --> 00:48:08,929
Are Teddy or Naomi
working tonight?

1225
00:48:08,973 --> 00:48:10,757
No, but Teddy said
he'd be stopping by

1226
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:12,019
to pick up
his paycheck.

1227
00:48:12,063 --> 00:48:13,978
Oh, perfect.
I'll wait around.

1228
00:48:14,021 --> 00:48:15,631
What'll you have?

1229
00:48:15,675 --> 00:48:18,156
Whatever Santa's having.

1230
00:48:18,199 --> 00:48:19,853
- Hi.
- Hi.

1231
00:48:22,247 --> 00:48:23,813
So how's
the Santa business?

1232
00:48:23,857 --> 00:48:25,772
It's not bad...

1233
00:48:25,815 --> 00:48:27,165
except for
the fucking kids.

1234
00:48:27,208 --> 00:48:28,731
Really?

1235
00:48:28,775 --> 00:48:30,255
The greed level
you wouldn't believe.

1236
00:48:30,298 --> 00:48:32,953
They all think Santa's
a soft touch.

1237
00:48:32,997 --> 00:48:35,216
You suggest a game,
they want a computer.

1238
00:48:35,260 --> 00:48:37,305
You suggest a doll,
they want a pony.

1239
00:48:37,349 --> 00:48:38,654
That's
the world, huh?

1240
00:48:38,698 --> 00:48:40,047
And then you get
your beard-tuggers,

1241
00:48:40,091 --> 00:48:43,094
your pants-wetters
and your crybabies.

1242
00:48:43,137 --> 00:48:44,965
I'm telling you,
at the end of the day,

1243
00:48:45,009 --> 00:48:46,880
I'm proud
to be a Jew.

1244
00:48:46,924 --> 00:48:48,360
You're terrible.

1245
00:48:48,403 --> 00:48:50,840
- Are you anti-Semitic?
- No.

1246
00:48:50,884 --> 00:48:51,972
You come sit on
Santa's lap.

1247
00:48:52,016 --> 00:48:53,539
Forget it.

1248
00:48:53,582 --> 00:48:54,932
Bah, humbug.

1249
00:48:56,977 --> 00:48:59,023
How about another one for me
and my 12 tiny reindeer?

1250
00:48:59,066 --> 00:49:01,547
- Sure. Another?
- Yeah, please.

1251
00:49:01,590 --> 00:49:03,288
I'm Ray.
What's your name?

1252
00:49:03,331 --> 00:49:04,506
- Maggie.
- What?

1253
00:49:04,550 --> 00:49:06,552
Maggie.

1254
00:49:06,595 --> 00:49:09,598
Make it a double.

1255
00:49:20,783 --> 00:49:23,047
Oops.

1256
00:49:23,090 --> 00:49:24,831
Excuse me.

1257
00:49:24,874 --> 00:49:26,964
Who was that?

1258
00:49:27,007 --> 00:49:28,704
Nobody, baby.

1259
00:49:28,748 --> 00:49:30,445
Come on, touch it
just a little bit?

1260
00:49:30,489 --> 00:49:32,099
No.

1261
00:49:32,143 --> 00:49:34,275
More kissing.

1262
00:49:37,322 --> 00:49:39,585
Yeah, cab drivers
get a lot more press,

1263
00:49:39,628 --> 00:49:42,066
but, uh, I delivered
four babies.

1264
00:49:42,109 --> 00:49:43,284
Really? Four?

1265
00:49:43,328 --> 00:49:45,460
Uh-huh.
Three boys and a girl.

1266
00:49:45,504 --> 00:49:47,985
Barkeep said
your brother
was here earlier,

1267
00:49:48,028 --> 00:49:50,552
but nobody matching
Jimmy or Minor's
description.

1268
00:49:50,596 --> 00:49:51,945
Good.

1269
00:49:51,989 --> 00:49:53,425
Jimmy knows this is
one of Ray's haunts.

1270
00:49:53,468 --> 00:49:54,730
He'll get here
eventually.

1271
00:49:54,774 --> 00:49:58,038
Phil was sharing
some of his
war stories.

1272
00:49:58,082 --> 00:49:59,561
What war?

1273
00:49:59,605 --> 00:50:01,955
Our jobs.
It's an expression.

1274
00:50:01,999 --> 00:50:02,956
Cool.

1275
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,132
I pulled
a three-prong plug

1276
00:50:05,176 --> 00:50:07,395
out of a guy's
trachea once.

1277
00:50:07,439 --> 00:50:09,180
It was on
a juicer.

1278
00:50:09,223 --> 00:50:11,660
Yeah. The guy was trying
to chew off the third prong.

1279
00:50:11,704 --> 00:50:13,445
Stuck.

1280
00:50:13,488 --> 00:50:15,273
I just grabbed it
and yanked.

1281
00:50:15,316 --> 00:50:17,144
Yeah. The guy could
have done it himself,
but he was panicking.

1282
00:50:17,188 --> 00:50:18,232
He was blue.

1283
00:50:18,276 --> 00:50:21,061
People sure
can be stupid.

1284
00:50:21,105 --> 00:50:22,889
I mean, really,
buy a fucking adaptor.

1285
00:50:24,499 --> 00:50:26,066
Sorry about
the "F" word.

1286
00:50:26,110 --> 00:50:27,241
It's okay.

1287
00:50:27,285 --> 00:50:30,201
Susan. Hi.

1288
00:50:30,244 --> 00:50:31,550
I'm-- I'm April.

1289
00:50:31,593 --> 00:50:34,248
I'm sort of
a friend of Ray's.

1290
00:50:34,292 --> 00:50:36,033
Sort of?

1291
00:50:36,076 --> 00:50:38,078
Yeah. Well, I've been
going around with him
this evening

1292
00:50:38,122 --> 00:50:40,080
trying to get
the money.

1293
00:50:44,519 --> 00:50:46,478
I just thought
you should know it's...

1294
00:50:46,521 --> 00:50:48,088
it's not going
very well,

1295
00:50:48,132 --> 00:50:49,524
in case you want
to make other plans.

1296
00:50:49,568 --> 00:50:51,613
- Damn.
- What's up?

1297
00:50:51,657 --> 00:50:54,007
I need money

1298
00:50:54,051 --> 00:50:57,097
for, um...
a problem.

1299
00:50:57,141 --> 00:51:00,318
How much?

1300
00:51:00,361 --> 00:51:01,971
900.

1301
00:51:02,015 --> 00:51:04,974
That is a problem.

1302
00:51:05,018 --> 00:51:07,934
He's just useless
at being able to
ask for it, you know?

1303
00:51:07,977 --> 00:51:10,980
I mean, at least
I tried to help him get
the 600 from Maggie, but...

1304
00:51:11,024 --> 00:51:12,286
Oh, you didn't.

1305
00:51:12,330 --> 00:51:15,942
Yeah. Well, Ray wasn't
very happy about it, either.

1306
00:51:15,985 --> 00:51:19,772
The money is
really for Maggie.

1307
00:51:19,815 --> 00:51:21,252
What?

1308
00:51:21,295 --> 00:51:22,601
I lied to Ray.

1309
00:51:22,644 --> 00:51:24,820
It's Maggie who
needs the, um...

1310
00:51:24,864 --> 00:51:27,084
abortion.

1311
00:51:27,127 --> 00:51:29,608
Oh, shit!

1312
00:51:32,219 --> 00:51:34,047
Hey, Chip.

1313
00:51:34,091 --> 00:51:35,135
Hey, heartbreaker,
what's up?

1314
00:51:35,179 --> 00:51:36,397
Pinot grigio?

1315
00:51:36,441 --> 00:51:38,704
Actually, I'm just
looking for Ray.

1316
00:51:38,747 --> 00:51:41,315
Hasn't been in.
You guys back together?

1317
00:51:41,359 --> 00:51:44,797
No. He's just...
he's kind of in a jam,

1318
00:51:44,840 --> 00:51:46,190
and I got some
money I owe him,

1319
00:51:46,233 --> 00:51:47,582
and, uh...

1320
00:51:47,626 --> 00:51:49,149
I'm gonna check
a couple other places,

1321
00:51:49,193 --> 00:51:50,455
but if he comes in,
would you tell him

1322
00:51:50,498 --> 00:51:51,456
I'll be at Hi-Life
at closing?

1323
00:51:51,499 --> 00:51:54,067
Sure.
Bad jam, huh?

1324
00:51:54,111 --> 00:51:55,590
Family.

1325
00:51:55,634 --> 00:51:58,376
Shit. 'Cause I owe him,
like, 50.

1326
00:51:58,419 --> 00:51:59,812
- Really?
- Yeah.

1327
00:51:59,855 --> 00:52:02,031
'Cause if you could,
this would be
a great time.

1328
00:52:02,075 --> 00:52:04,817
All right. Well,
I'll tell you what. Uh...

1329
00:52:04,860 --> 00:52:06,079
Here's 40.

1330
00:52:06,123 --> 00:52:08,560
Great.
Thanks.

1331
00:52:08,603 --> 00:52:11,432
Yeah. And, uh, don't forget
where it came from.

1332
00:52:11,476 --> 00:52:13,956
Sure, Chet-- Chad?
Chaz.

1333
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:15,262
Funny. Real funny.

1334
00:52:15,306 --> 00:52:16,655
- Charlie?
- Uh-huh.

1335
00:52:22,617 --> 00:52:24,793
- Santa: Oh, poop.
- What?

1336
00:52:24,837 --> 00:52:26,882
I dipped my beard
in my Woo Woo.

1337
00:52:26,926 --> 00:52:28,232
How do you keep
that thing on?

1338
00:52:28,275 --> 00:52:30,538
With this elastic
business right here.

1339
00:52:30,582 --> 00:52:32,323
Hey, I know you.

1340
00:52:32,366 --> 00:52:33,454
Everybody knows
Santa--

1341
00:52:33,498 --> 00:52:34,760
You ever go into
the Hi-Life?

1342
00:52:34,803 --> 00:52:36,240
Yeah, you're
the bartender.

1343
00:52:36,283 --> 00:52:38,067
- Yeah.
- Simon.

1344
00:52:38,111 --> 00:52:39,721
I owe you
40 bucks.

1345
00:52:39,765 --> 00:52:41,680
- You're April's guy.
- Was.

1346
00:52:41,723 --> 00:52:43,203
We said our
"cheerios."

1347
00:52:43,247 --> 00:52:44,813
You moved
someplace.

1348
00:52:44,857 --> 00:52:46,163
'Frisco.

1349
00:52:46,206 --> 00:52:47,555
Hated it.

1350
00:52:47,599 --> 00:52:49,209
It's foggy
all the time,

1351
00:52:49,253 --> 00:52:51,168
and they get
really pissy if
you call it 'Frisco.

1352
00:52:51,211 --> 00:52:53,431
"It's not 'Frisco!
It's San Francisco!"

1353
00:52:53,474 --> 00:52:55,650
Well, you know,
excuse me for
abbreviating.

1354
00:52:55,694 --> 00:52:58,044
April still thinks
you're there.

1355
00:52:58,087 --> 00:53:00,786
Smooth, huh?

1356
00:53:19,021 --> 00:53:20,936
Oh!

1357
00:53:20,980 --> 00:53:23,374
Shit! Shit!

1358
00:53:23,417 --> 00:53:25,593
Shit. I got schmutz
all over my shirt.

1359
00:53:25,637 --> 00:53:27,247
Get it back
in your pants!

1360
00:53:27,291 --> 00:53:28,596
Oh, my God. This is
so embarrassing.

1361
00:53:28,640 --> 00:53:29,989
Man: 
Get the hell 
out of there!

1362
00:53:30,032 --> 00:53:31,295
Eat me!

1363
00:53:31,338 --> 00:53:33,079
Come on.

1364
00:53:46,701 --> 00:53:48,790
Like I said, the kid
was in a ski mask.

1365
00:53:48,834 --> 00:53:50,444
I don't think
I could spot him.

1366
00:53:50,488 --> 00:53:52,185
Yeah, it's a waste,
I know,

1367
00:53:52,229 --> 00:53:54,274
but, uh, procedure
in a shooting.

1368
00:53:54,318 --> 00:53:56,276
How you feeling anyway?

1369
00:53:56,320 --> 00:53:57,408
I'm a little spacey.

1370
00:53:57,451 --> 00:53:59,497
Blood loss.

1371
00:53:59,540 --> 00:54:02,761
Do like you gave
and drink some orange juice.

1372
00:54:02,804 --> 00:54:03,675
What about that one?

1373
00:54:06,330 --> 00:54:07,853
Minor: 
Not tall enough.

1374
00:54:07,896 --> 00:54:09,594
This guy was 
a real stringbean.

1375
00:54:09,637 --> 00:54:12,727
Oh, yeah, yeah.
He was 6'7", 6'8".

1376
00:54:12,771 --> 00:54:14,599
He was tall.

1377
00:54:14,642 --> 00:54:16,688
Sounds like the Knicks
could use him.

1378
00:54:17,732 --> 00:54:20,692
Christ.
Maybe it's his.

1379
00:54:20,735 --> 00:54:22,041
What?

1380
00:54:22,084 --> 00:54:23,521
The baby.
Maybe it's Ray's.

1381
00:54:23,564 --> 00:54:26,698
No, they've been
broken up since...

1382
00:54:26,741 --> 00:54:28,830
at least August.

1383
00:54:28,874 --> 00:54:31,920
Maybe one time,
for old times' sake?

1384
00:54:31,964 --> 00:54:33,095
He wouldn't.

1385
00:54:33,139 --> 00:54:34,619
Morals.

1386
00:54:34,662 --> 00:54:35,924
Stodginess.

1387
00:54:35,968 --> 00:54:37,448
Bit of the same
thing, really.

1388
00:54:37,491 --> 00:54:39,319
Hey.

1389
00:54:39,363 --> 00:54:41,278
You're English,
aren't you?

1390
00:54:41,321 --> 00:54:44,455
Yes.

1391
00:54:44,498 --> 00:54:47,632
April: 
I should go 
and find him.

1392
00:54:47,675 --> 00:54:49,938
I left a message for him
on my answering machine.

1393
00:54:49,982 --> 00:54:53,507
I told him I'd meet
him at the Hi-Life
at closing.

1394
00:54:53,551 --> 00:54:56,989
Maybe if I explain it
correctly,

1395
00:54:57,032 --> 00:54:59,600
the irony that I asked
the girl who broke his heart

1396
00:54:59,644 --> 00:55:01,080
for the money
she owed him

1397
00:55:01,123 --> 00:55:03,343
to give to you
for your abortion

1398
00:55:03,387 --> 00:55:05,693
when she doesn't
really have it,

1399
00:55:05,737 --> 00:55:08,348
because you were asking 
for it to give to her 
for her abortion,

1400
00:55:08,392 --> 00:55:11,090
- maybe he'd
find that funny.
- No.

1401
00:55:11,133 --> 00:55:13,048
Not a chance?

1402
00:55:13,092 --> 00:55:14,702
Ray thinks
jokes are funny.

1403
00:55:14,746 --> 00:55:16,878
He has no idea
life is.

1404
00:55:18,880 --> 00:55:20,665
You don't think maybe
you should call April,

1405
00:55:20,708 --> 00:55:22,623
let her know
you're back in town?

1406
00:55:22,667 --> 00:55:25,322
What's the point?

1407
00:55:25,365 --> 00:55:27,541
It's the right thing
to do.

1408
00:55:27,585 --> 00:55:29,891
It's over.

1409
00:55:29,935 --> 00:55:33,547
When she runs into you,
she's gonna feel
pretty shitty.

1410
00:55:33,591 --> 00:55:36,463
That's why
the disguise.

1411
00:55:39,031 --> 00:55:40,859
I don't think
it's funny.

1412
00:55:40,902 --> 00:55:42,817
I really don't
give a shit
what you think.

1413
00:55:42,861 --> 00:55:46,255
- Maybe you'd better.
- Hey, you two, play nice.

1414
00:55:46,299 --> 00:55:48,867
She was very
affectionate in bed.

1415
00:55:48,910 --> 00:55:50,259
I find that
a turn-off.

1416
00:55:50,303 --> 00:55:52,044
Okay, why don't
you shut up, asshole?

1417
00:55:52,087 --> 00:55:53,437
Maggie: 
Take it outside.

1418
00:55:53,480 --> 00:55:54,699
- Why, are you doing her?
- Watch your mouth!

1419
00:55:54,742 --> 00:55:57,223
What, are you defending
your lady, huh, loser?

1420
00:55:57,266 --> 00:55:58,093
You're gonna
eat that beard, pal.

1421
00:55:58,137 --> 00:56:01,009
Hey!
Outside, now!

1422
00:56:01,053 --> 00:56:02,794
- Let's go.
- You wanna do the dance?

1423
00:56:02,837 --> 00:56:05,318
Oh, yeah.
Come on, puff boy.

1424
00:56:05,362 --> 00:56:06,841
- Ray: Tubby.
- Simon: Tubby? 
Them's fightin' words.

1425
00:56:06,885 --> 00:56:09,061
Puff boy.

1426
00:56:09,104 --> 00:56:10,889
Hey, bitch!

1427
00:56:10,932 --> 00:56:13,500
Bitch! I'll kick your
fuckin' bitch ass!

1428
00:56:13,544 --> 00:56:15,372
Oh!

1429
00:56:17,461 --> 00:56:20,377
Looks like we got a little
altercation up ahead.

1430
00:56:20,420 --> 00:56:23,249
Dispatch, this is car
1157.

1431
00:56:23,292 --> 00:56:25,294
We're at 84th
and Amsterdam.

1432
00:56:25,338 --> 00:56:27,122
We have another 
battling Santa.

1433
00:56:27,166 --> 00:56:28,515
Lot of Santa
brawls, huh?

1434
00:56:28,559 --> 00:56:29,603
Oh, yeah.

1435
00:56:29,647 --> 00:56:31,388
Couple of drinks
in 'em,

1436
00:56:31,431 --> 00:56:32,693
they think the fat suit
makes them invincible.

1437
00:56:32,737 --> 00:56:34,216
Come here!

1438
00:56:34,260 --> 00:56:35,914
You messed
with the wrong Santa!

1439
00:56:35,957 --> 00:56:38,003
Fucker!

1440
00:56:38,046 --> 00:56:41,354
- Officer: Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!
- Partner: Come on! Break it up!

1441
00:56:41,398 --> 00:56:43,704
Partner:
You don't wanna
go downtown!

1442
00:56:43,748 --> 00:56:45,880
- Can we all
chill out here?
- Simon: Bozo!

1443
00:56:45,924 --> 00:56:48,535
Shit.

1444
00:56:48,579 --> 00:56:49,623
You're going your
separate ways, right?

1445
00:56:49,667 --> 00:56:50,581
Yes, sir, Officer.

1446
00:56:52,539 --> 00:56:54,280
You son of a bitch!

1447
00:56:54,323 --> 00:56:56,369
- Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!
- I'm gonna tear you
to pieces!

1448
00:56:56,413 --> 00:56:57,849
- Who?
- That asshole!

1449
00:56:57,892 --> 00:56:58,893
All right,
knock it off.

1450
00:56:58,937 --> 00:57:00,286
Hey, you know this guy?

1451
00:57:00,329 --> 00:57:01,766
Sure does.

1452
00:57:01,809 --> 00:57:03,202
Ray. Ray,
you got to listen--

1453
00:57:03,245 --> 00:57:04,986
No fucking way, man!

1454
00:57:05,030 --> 00:57:07,467
Officer, sir--
sir, he knocked up
my sister.

1455
00:57:07,511 --> 00:57:08,555
No wonder
he was touchy.

1456
00:57:08,599 --> 00:57:09,643
Shut up.

1457
00:57:09,687 --> 00:57:11,819
This is the third
fucking time, Jimmy!

1458
00:57:11,863 --> 00:57:13,604
- No, it's not like that.
- No? How is it, huh?

1459
00:57:13,647 --> 00:57:15,562
You gonna tell me
it was someone else?
My sister's a slut?

1460
00:57:15,606 --> 00:57:17,825
No, no, no.
It was me, but it was--

1461
00:57:17,869 --> 00:57:20,437
An accident?
Three times, Jimmy.
You're gonna pay.

1462
00:57:20,480 --> 00:57:21,742
I will. I will.

1463
00:57:21,786 --> 00:57:23,483
Maggie's got 600 bucks
for you, man.

1464
00:57:23,527 --> 00:57:24,484
I swear to God
I'm gonna pay you back.

1465
00:57:24,528 --> 00:57:26,268
Not for the abortion,
asshole!

1466
00:57:26,312 --> 00:57:28,488
- For being so stupid!
- Hey, hey, hey, hey.

1467
00:57:28,532 --> 00:57:30,490
Just let me have
a piece of him.
Please?

1468
00:57:30,534 --> 00:57:31,491
- Please?
- What do you think?

1469
00:57:31,535 --> 00:57:33,537
Well, he does
got it coming.

1470
00:57:33,580 --> 00:57:35,495
All right,
we'll give you
a minute.

1471
00:57:35,539 --> 00:57:36,409
But that'll have
to be enough.

1472
00:57:36,453 --> 00:57:38,498
- That's plenty.
- Come on.

1473
00:57:38,542 --> 00:57:41,109
Hey! Wait! Wait
Wait! Wait!

1474
00:57:41,153 --> 00:57:42,023
I'm gonna
marry her.

1475
00:57:42,067 --> 00:57:43,503
What?

1476
00:57:43,547 --> 00:57:44,722
I'm gonna ask her
to marry me.

1477
00:57:44,765 --> 00:57:46,811
We'll have the baby.

1478
00:57:46,854 --> 00:57:50,075
That's crazy.
She won't say yes.

1479
00:57:50,118 --> 00:57:51,642
I can't control that.
That's up to her.

1480
00:57:51,685 --> 00:57:54,558
But I gotta do
the honorable thing.

1481
00:57:54,601 --> 00:57:56,777
I'm just doing
what a man's gotta do.

1482
00:57:56,821 --> 00:57:58,039
- Hey...
- What?

1483
00:57:58,083 --> 00:58:00,389
I'm sorry that you don't
seem to approve,

1484
00:58:00,433 --> 00:58:02,827
but now you really got
no right to beat me up.

1485
00:58:02,870 --> 00:58:05,046
He's got a point.

1486
00:58:05,090 --> 00:58:06,352
Doesn't change
what he did.

1487
00:58:06,395 --> 00:58:08,223
Puts it in
a different context.

1488
00:58:08,267 --> 00:58:09,529
- Shut up!
- Shut up!

1489
00:58:09,573 --> 00:58:11,792
What about him?
Can I take a pop
at Santa?

1490
00:58:11,836 --> 00:58:14,491
- Beat it back to the Pole.
- Yes, sir, Officer, sir.

1491
00:58:14,534 --> 00:58:16,014
Don't be surprised
if you get a little coal

1492
00:58:16,057 --> 00:58:17,145
in your stocking
this year.

1493
00:58:17,189 --> 00:58:18,407
Ho ho ho,
you fuck!

1494
00:58:18,451 --> 00:58:21,280
Blow me.
Merry Christmas.

1495
00:58:21,323 --> 00:58:22,542
I know you're
a little upset.

1496
00:58:22,586 --> 00:58:24,283
Upset? You as
a brother-in-law?

1497
00:58:24,326 --> 00:58:27,286
Maybe after
I tear you to pieces,
I'll be down to upset.

1498
00:58:27,329 --> 00:58:29,375
- He's got you, Ray.
- Who the fuck are you?

1499
00:58:29,418 --> 00:58:31,377
Name's Minor.
I sympathize with you,

1500
00:58:31,420 --> 00:58:33,422
but it's kind of
like, well...

1501
00:58:33,466 --> 00:58:34,772
what about
a shotgun wedding?

1502
00:58:34,815 --> 00:58:36,251
If the groom
goes through with it,

1503
00:58:36,295 --> 00:58:38,036
you're not
gonna go ahead and
shoot him anyway, eh?

1504
00:58:38,079 --> 00:58:39,559
That's true.

1505
00:58:39,603 --> 00:58:41,387
It's time-honored.

1506
00:58:41,430 --> 00:58:43,650
You think you can
control yourself?

1507
00:58:43,694 --> 00:58:46,087
- Do I have a choice?
- A night in the Tombs.

1508
00:58:46,131 --> 00:58:48,350
I'll keep him in line.
At least till you hear

1509
00:58:48,394 --> 00:58:50,527
if your sister wants
to do the "I dos."

1510
00:58:50,570 --> 00:58:53,312
- Can you manage that?
- I guess.

1511
00:58:53,355 --> 00:58:55,967
- Partner: You can go then.
- Okay, thanks.
Thank you.

1512
00:58:56,010 --> 00:58:56,968
Come on, Jimmy.

1513
00:59:03,409 --> 00:59:04,366
Ricky: 
Mom, look--

1514
00:59:04,410 --> 00:59:06,934
yeah, Mom, Minor's
gonna explain.

1515
00:59:06,978 --> 00:59:08,936
He is.

1516
00:59:08,980 --> 00:59:11,678
Okay, okay. Yeah.
Mom, I know.
Things came up.

1517
00:59:11,722 --> 00:59:14,246
Great.
Your sister.

1518
00:59:14,289 --> 00:59:16,161
This is one time you'll
be happy to see her.

1519
00:59:16,204 --> 00:59:17,554
She's a bitch.
I'm grabbing a booth.

1520
00:59:17,597 --> 00:59:18,772
She's got the 600.

1521
00:59:18,816 --> 00:59:20,818
Oh, here he is.

1522
00:59:20,861 --> 00:59:22,820
Sis!

1523
00:59:22,863 --> 00:59:24,952
Hey. Did you walk
into a mirror?

1524
00:59:24,996 --> 00:59:26,606
Hey, Ray.

1525
00:59:26,650 --> 00:59:28,565
- Mom, really, it's okay.
- You're working hard.

1526
00:59:28,608 --> 00:59:30,001
- You're not
serving him, are you?
- I gotta go.

1527
00:59:30,044 --> 00:59:32,569
- He's maybe 12.
- Mom, I'm hanging up.

1528
00:59:32,612 --> 00:59:35,528
I love you.

1529
00:59:35,572 --> 00:59:38,009
I'm 16, and I'm
meeting him.

1530
00:59:38,052 --> 00:59:40,751
- Can't I go?
- No, do the tables.

1531
00:59:40,794 --> 00:59:42,187
So...

1532
00:59:42,230 --> 00:59:43,405
I'm not taking
any money.

1533
00:59:43,449 --> 00:59:45,190
- Ray!
- You're owed it.

1534
00:59:45,233 --> 00:59:46,887
You get it from
your new boyfriend?

1535
00:59:46,931 --> 00:59:48,846
That's what I thought.
Forget it.

1536
00:59:48,889 --> 00:59:50,195
Ray, would you stop
thinking about yourself?

1537
00:59:50,238 --> 00:59:51,631
Yeah.

1538
00:59:51,675 --> 00:59:52,589
Normally, you should do
a little more of that,

1539
00:59:52,632 --> 00:59:53,720
but this isn't
the time to start.

1540
00:59:53,764 --> 00:59:56,723
I should have started
the day we met.

1541
00:59:56,767 --> 00:59:59,421
I'm grounded,
like, for life.

1542
00:59:59,465 --> 01:00:01,815
You got the gun?

1543
01:00:01,859 --> 01:00:04,165
Yeah. You owe me big
because Mom's gonna be
furious.

1544
01:00:04,209 --> 01:00:07,255
I'll figure something.
Slip it into my pocket.

1545
01:00:07,299 --> 01:00:10,476
There's the 600,
plus 80 from
Chip and Derek.

1546
01:00:10,519 --> 01:00:11,956
What?

1547
01:00:11,999 --> 01:00:14,480
I was looking for you,
and they pitched in.

1548
01:00:14,523 --> 01:00:16,134
Ray: Hi-Life Bar and Grill.

1549
01:00:16,177 --> 01:00:18,702
Hello? Hello?

1550
01:00:18,745 --> 01:00:21,139
Man,
I'm lightheaded.

1551
01:00:21,182 --> 01:00:22,923
Really?
How come?

1552
01:00:22,967 --> 01:00:25,447
Think back.

1553
01:00:25,491 --> 01:00:27,014
Oh, right.

1554
01:00:27,058 --> 01:00:28,189
I'll take the 80, that's all.

1555
01:00:28,233 --> 01:00:30,539
Take the six,
for Susan.

1556
01:00:30,583 --> 01:00:31,889
I thought you were
gonna marry her.

1557
01:00:31,932 --> 01:00:33,325
- What?
- I'm asking her.

1558
01:00:33,368 --> 01:00:34,848
Are you serious?

1559
01:00:34,892 --> 01:00:36,458
I'm doing
the right thing.

1560
01:00:36,502 --> 01:00:38,069
But I don't want her
to feel like she's
got no choice.

1561
01:00:38,112 --> 01:00:39,636
I mean, if she wants
to start a family,
that's great,

1562
01:00:39,679 --> 01:00:41,115
but she should
have the option.

1563
01:00:41,159 --> 01:00:43,291
So if I take it, there's
less chance she'll marry you?

1564
01:00:43,335 --> 01:00:45,293
- I'll take it.
- Good.

1565
01:00:45,337 --> 01:00:46,512
Now you can leave.

1566
01:00:46,555 --> 01:00:48,557
After you buy me
a drink.

1567
01:00:48,601 --> 01:00:50,864
- Golden margarita?
- You remember.

1568
01:00:50,908 --> 01:00:53,432
- Too much.
- Oh, please.

1569
01:00:53,475 --> 01:00:55,173
Ray, was the phone
for me?

1570
01:00:55,216 --> 01:00:57,131
Oh, yeah? Why would
the phone be for you?

1571
01:00:57,175 --> 01:00:58,393
Because I'm popular?

1572
01:00:58,437 --> 01:01:00,221
It was nobody.
You can go.
I'll close.

1573
01:01:00,265 --> 01:01:01,788
Thanks.
See ya.

1574
01:01:01,832 --> 01:01:03,921
Bye.

1575
01:01:03,964 --> 01:01:05,357
Salt?

1576
01:01:05,400 --> 01:01:07,098
Save it for
your wounds.

1577
01:01:07,141 --> 01:01:08,142
- Ray?
- What?

1578
01:01:08,186 --> 01:01:09,230
- Could I have the money?
- No.

1579
01:01:09,274 --> 01:01:11,102
- For Sue. I could--
- No.

1580
01:01:11,145 --> 01:01:13,626
Okay, fine, but please
don't give it to her
in front of people.

1581
01:01:13,670 --> 01:01:15,062
She's embarrassed
enough as it is.

1582
01:01:15,106 --> 01:01:16,368
- She should be.
- Ray--

1583
01:01:16,411 --> 01:01:19,676
All right!
Go talk with
your friends.

1584
01:01:22,809 --> 01:01:25,507
I'm only taking it 'cause
Susan needs it so badly.

1585
01:01:25,551 --> 01:01:28,075
I still think you're
the force of evil.

1586
01:01:28,119 --> 01:01:30,556
It's better than
thinking I'm an angel.

1587
01:01:33,515 --> 01:01:35,996
I guess Ray must have
thumped Jimmy

1588
01:01:36,040 --> 01:01:38,520
before he had the chance
to tell him it's Maggie
that's pregnant.

1589
01:01:38,564 --> 01:01:40,087
Yeah.

1590
01:01:40,131 --> 01:01:42,611
Maybe he gave him
a really good head butt

1591
01:01:42,655 --> 01:01:45,092
and cracked him open
like an egg.

1592
01:01:45,136 --> 01:01:47,573
April: Oh. Sorry.

1593
01:01:47,616 --> 01:01:50,663
Would you just lose
the fucking grudge, Ray?

1594
01:01:50,707 --> 01:01:53,144
Okay, so we broke up.
Fine. It's over. Move on.

1595
01:01:53,187 --> 01:01:54,580
We didn't break up.
I was dumped.

1596
01:01:56,060 --> 01:01:57,409
It happens.

1597
01:01:57,452 --> 01:02:00,020
You've been dumped?

1598
01:02:00,064 --> 01:02:01,892
Well, no, but--

1599
01:02:01,935 --> 01:02:03,023
Exactly.

1600
01:02:03,067 --> 01:02:05,591
But I still felt.

1601
01:02:05,634 --> 01:02:08,028
I mean, when you think
that something's great,

1602
01:02:08,072 --> 01:02:09,595
and then it turns out
all wrong,

1603
01:02:09,638 --> 01:02:10,857
and you don't know
how or when,

1604
01:02:10,901 --> 01:02:12,337
but you know that
you've got to get out of it,

1605
01:02:12,380 --> 01:02:14,731
well, that's not
much fun, either.

1606
01:02:17,255 --> 01:02:18,778
This is working.

1607
01:02:18,822 --> 01:02:20,780
All I gotta do
is get him to give
the money to Susan

1608
01:02:20,824 --> 01:02:22,651
without telling her
it's for Maggie.

1609
01:02:22,695 --> 01:02:24,653
And make Susan
an honest woman.

1610
01:02:24,697 --> 01:02:26,743
I thought this out.
If she says yes,

1611
01:02:26,786 --> 01:02:28,570
I'll get her to pretend
she miscarried.

1612
01:02:28,614 --> 01:02:29,746
Neat.

1613
01:02:29,789 --> 01:02:32,923
But you do realize
you'll still be married.

1614
01:02:32,966 --> 01:02:35,664
Sure. I know.

1615
01:02:35,708 --> 01:02:37,231
Maybe I'm ready.

1616
01:02:39,712 --> 01:02:42,584
April: 
I should never have 
told her I liked Ray.

1617
01:02:42,628 --> 01:02:43,760
Now there's 
competition,

1618
01:02:43,803 --> 01:02:45,805
she's gonna find him
irresistible again.

1619
01:02:45,849 --> 01:02:47,459
He's probably just
making her grovel

1620
01:02:47,502 --> 01:02:50,201
before he gives her
whatever money he's got.

1621
01:02:50,244 --> 01:02:52,812
We could
go inside and see.

1622
01:02:52,856 --> 01:02:54,771
Yeah, but
speculation's
so much safer

1623
01:02:54,814 --> 01:02:57,991
than finding out
the truth.

1624
01:02:58,035 --> 01:03:00,951
You don't like me,
so why waste your time
hating me?

1625
01:03:00,994 --> 01:03:02,822
You're the kind of
person who'd rather
be thought of

1626
01:03:02,866 --> 01:03:04,650
as a force of evil
than an angel.

1627
01:03:04,693 --> 01:03:07,566
That's so people can be
pleasantly surprised

1628
01:03:07,609 --> 01:03:09,481
rather than horribly
disappointed.

1629
01:03:09,524 --> 01:03:10,830
Oh, I don't
think so, Maggie.

1630
01:03:10,874 --> 01:03:13,354
It's all
bullshit, Ray.

1631
01:03:13,398 --> 01:03:15,356
You don't know
who I am.

1632
01:03:15,400 --> 01:03:18,185
You just-- you turn me
into extremes.

1633
01:03:18,229 --> 01:03:20,927
You either put me
on a pedestal, or
you beat me with it.

1634
01:03:20,971 --> 01:03:22,581
Yeah?

1635
01:03:22,624 --> 01:03:25,062
I'm just an idea to you,
and I don't want that.

1636
01:03:25,105 --> 01:03:26,759
That's why we broke up,

1637
01:03:26,803 --> 01:03:29,718
and that's why it shouldn't
be a big deal that we did.

1638
01:03:29,762 --> 01:03:32,460
Because you didn't
really lose me.

1639
01:03:32,504 --> 01:03:36,203
You see, you just lost
some dream version of me.

1640
01:03:36,247 --> 01:03:40,947
Well, I may be great,
but I'm not a slice
of heaven, Ray.

1641
01:03:40,991 --> 01:03:43,732
If you'd just stop
wanting angels,

1642
01:03:43,776 --> 01:03:46,779
maybe you'll
find yourself
a... someone.

1643
01:03:48,694 --> 01:03:51,175
Why don't you
drink up?

1644
01:03:54,526 --> 01:03:55,744
I'm not thirsty
anymore.

1645
01:03:58,095 --> 01:03:59,357
Hey, Maggie.

1646
01:03:59,400 --> 01:04:01,054
- Hi.
- April: Hello.

1647
01:04:01,098 --> 01:04:03,970
- You found him.
- Yes, so did you.

1648
01:04:04,014 --> 01:04:05,667
Susan! Honey!

1649
01:04:05,711 --> 01:04:07,060
I-I thought
you were waiting
at home.

1650
01:04:07,104 --> 01:04:08,235
- April.
- We gave her a lift.

1651
01:04:08,279 --> 01:04:10,455
- Raymond.
- Do I know these guys?

1652
01:04:10,498 --> 01:04:12,544
They want to
tell you about
an audition.

1653
01:04:12,587 --> 01:04:14,807
Really? For what?
Is it a feature?

1654
01:04:14,851 --> 01:04:16,896
They went with a name.
Would you like a beer?

1655
01:04:16,940 --> 01:04:18,855
Thank you.

1656
01:04:18,898 --> 01:04:20,987
- Can we have three
McSorley's, please?
- Ray: Okay.

1657
01:04:21,031 --> 01:04:23,076
- Could you bring me
that margarita?
- No, no, no! No, no!

1658
01:04:23,120 --> 01:04:24,904
- I was just gonna
walk you out to a cab.
- That's okay.

1659
01:04:24,948 --> 01:04:27,211
You positive?
It's-- whoo-hoo!
It's really late.

1660
01:04:27,254 --> 01:04:29,169
- Chill.
- Last call.

1661
01:04:29,213 --> 01:04:30,779
Can I get me
an OJ?

1662
01:04:30,823 --> 01:04:34,174
Sure.
April?

1663
01:04:34,218 --> 01:04:36,133
Martini?

1664
01:04:36,176 --> 01:04:39,049
Uh, Stoli silver,
three olives.

1665
01:04:39,092 --> 01:04:41,399
Actually, um...

1666
01:04:41,442 --> 01:04:43,140
no.

1667
01:04:43,183 --> 01:04:46,360
Absolut?
It's on the house.

1668
01:04:46,404 --> 01:04:48,275
No, thank you.

1669
01:04:50,321 --> 01:04:52,889
Just get me
a vodka tonic.

1670
01:04:52,932 --> 01:04:54,151
You got it.

1671
01:04:54,194 --> 01:04:57,241
Excuse me.
Can we have
a little talk?

1672
01:04:57,284 --> 01:04:58,807
- Over there?
- Sure.

1673
01:04:58,851 --> 01:05:00,200
No. No, no.

1674
01:05:00,244 --> 01:05:02,202
I mean, what's a party
without girls?

1675
01:05:02,246 --> 01:05:03,987
We'll just be
a second.

1676
01:05:04,030 --> 01:05:06,424
Jimmy: 
I think it's really great 
the way you two get along.

1677
01:05:06,467 --> 01:05:08,469
I made a call.

1678
01:05:08,513 --> 01:05:10,776
- Fatty's on his way.
- Good.

1679
01:05:10,819 --> 01:05:12,821
You gotta help me out.
I'll get 'em back there,

1680
01:05:12,865 --> 01:05:14,432
and you talk about
something, anything.

1681
01:05:14,475 --> 01:05:17,391
Just keep them
off the subject till
I figure something.

1682
01:05:17,435 --> 01:05:18,827
- Hey, hey, hey!
- It's for them.

1683
01:05:18,871 --> 01:05:22,005
Not till somebody
pays for the beer.

1684
01:05:22,048 --> 01:05:24,746
Listen, I know about...
you know,

1685
01:05:24,790 --> 01:05:26,923
and I'm really sorry.

1686
01:05:26,966 --> 01:05:29,621
Shit happens.
Don't be.

1687
01:05:29,664 --> 01:05:31,884
I'm just sorry Ray
couldn't get the money.

1688
01:05:31,928 --> 01:05:34,234
He did.

1689
01:05:34,278 --> 01:05:35,888
You're kidding!
That's great!

1690
01:05:35,932 --> 01:05:37,194
Yeah.

1691
01:05:37,237 --> 01:05:39,587
I mean, it's hard to say
"great" in this situation.

1692
01:05:39,631 --> 01:05:41,850
- You know what I mean.
- Yeah.

1693
01:05:41,894 --> 01:05:44,288
Um, but I was thinking
that maybe, um,

1694
01:05:44,331 --> 01:05:46,029
we could...
you know,

1695
01:05:46,072 --> 01:05:49,249
we could go there
tomorrow, together?

1696
01:05:49,293 --> 01:05:51,164
Sure...

1697
01:05:51,208 --> 01:05:53,514
if you think
it would help.

1698
01:05:53,558 --> 01:05:55,995
Yeah, I do,
I think. Do you?

1699
01:05:56,039 --> 01:05:58,258
Here we go.

1700
01:05:58,302 --> 01:05:59,999
Everything cool?

1701
01:06:00,043 --> 01:06:01,696
Sure.

1702
01:06:01,740 --> 01:06:04,003
Yeah. I think
it would be good.

1703
01:06:04,047 --> 01:06:05,700
I mean, I'm glad you
thought you could ask,

1704
01:06:05,744 --> 01:06:08,529
with us never being
so close.

1705
01:06:08,573 --> 01:06:10,401
We women, we gotta
stick together,
you know.

1706
01:06:10,444 --> 01:06:13,621
Yeah. That's great.
Let's go join the others.

1707
01:06:13,665 --> 01:06:15,449
We're gonna
go to the doctor
together tomorrow.

1708
01:06:15,493 --> 01:06:16,973
Really?

1709
01:06:17,016 --> 01:06:19,236
Uh, you-you don't
have to go.

1710
01:06:19,279 --> 01:06:21,629
I'll go with her.

1711
01:06:23,022 --> 01:06:25,024
What do you think?

1712
01:06:25,068 --> 01:06:27,548
It's up to you.

1713
01:06:27,592 --> 01:06:29,594
I really think
it's a woman thing.

1714
01:06:29,637 --> 01:06:32,814
Yeah, we probably
shouldn't talk about it
in front of everybody.

1715
01:06:32,858 --> 01:06:34,294
There's nothing
left to talk about.

1716
01:06:34,338 --> 01:06:35,992
Great! Yeah.
Let's sit.

1717
01:06:39,125 --> 01:06:42,128
Hey, everybody.

1718
01:06:42,172 --> 01:06:44,261
What time should
we get together?

1719
01:06:44,304 --> 01:06:46,132
What time's
the appointment?

1720
01:06:48,482 --> 01:06:50,876
You!

1721
01:06:50,919 --> 01:06:52,225
Sis, please.

1722
01:06:52,269 --> 01:06:54,662
You are a dead man.

1723
01:06:56,664 --> 01:06:59,754
Wait.
You're not...?

1724
01:06:59,798 --> 01:07:02,366
No more than you.

1725
01:07:02,409 --> 01:07:04,759
Okay, okay, okay.

1726
01:07:04,803 --> 01:07:07,588
I lied.
I admit it.

1727
01:07:07,632 --> 01:07:09,938
It was awful. It was
a terrible lie to tell.

1728
01:07:09,982 --> 01:07:11,375
I thought it
wasn't that bad

1729
01:07:11,418 --> 01:07:12,854
because it wasn't true.

1730
01:07:12,898 --> 01:07:15,379
But I realize now
it was that bad.

1731
01:07:15,422 --> 01:07:16,989
And then you went and said
you were pregnant,

1732
01:07:17,033 --> 01:07:18,425
so it got worse.

1733
01:07:18,469 --> 01:07:20,775
But I only had
the best intentions.
I did it for you.

1734
01:07:20,819 --> 01:07:22,299
And I only said
Maggie needed one

1735
01:07:22,342 --> 01:07:24,344
'cause I knew no one
would give me money.

1736
01:07:24,388 --> 01:07:25,215
And if I was
gonna do this,

1737
01:07:25,258 --> 01:07:26,999
I wanted
to do it right,

1738
01:07:27,043 --> 01:07:29,436
with the ring
and the honeymoon
you deserve.

1739
01:07:30,959 --> 01:07:33,745
Susan...

1740
01:07:33,788 --> 01:07:35,964
will you
marry me?

1741
01:07:37,749 --> 01:07:39,968
Jeez, Jimmy, I don't
know what to say.

1742
01:07:41,927 --> 01:07:43,798
Say no.

1743
01:07:43,842 --> 01:07:47,280
I mean, really.
The guy's an idiot.

1744
01:07:47,324 --> 01:07:48,542
Hey, Jimmy.

1745
01:07:48,586 --> 01:07:50,022
Fatty's coming
across the street.

1746
01:07:50,066 --> 01:07:52,198
Excuse me.

1747
01:07:52,242 --> 01:07:54,331
April: 
There's someone 
called Fatty?

1748
01:07:56,289 --> 01:07:57,812
A guy Jimmy owes 900.

1749
01:07:57,856 --> 01:08:00,076
- Jimmy: Shit, Minor! 
-You asshole!

1750
01:08:00,119 --> 01:08:01,207
I'm sorry.

1751
01:08:01,251 --> 01:08:02,991
You'll do anything
for money.

1752
01:08:03,035 --> 01:08:04,428
It's not about money!

1753
01:08:04,471 --> 01:08:06,952
- Right.
- Son of a bitch.

1754
01:08:06,995 --> 01:08:09,215
It's about pain.
I'll do anything
to avoid pain.

1755
01:08:09,259 --> 01:08:11,522
- And disfigurement.
- Would you take me
for a drink?

1756
01:08:11,565 --> 01:08:12,784
Uh, sure.

1757
01:08:14,960 --> 01:08:16,266
Where's Jimmy?

1758
01:08:16,309 --> 01:08:18,050
All:
Behind the bar.

1759
01:08:18,094 --> 01:08:20,400
Thanks a lot.

1760
01:08:20,444 --> 01:08:22,272
Fatty. I was just--

1761
01:08:22,315 --> 01:08:23,490
Fatty: 
Shut up!

1762
01:08:23,534 --> 01:08:25,231
Minor.

1763
01:08:26,363 --> 01:08:27,755
What did you need
the kid for?

1764
01:08:27,799 --> 01:08:29,105
I didn't want him
to ditch me

1765
01:08:29,148 --> 01:08:30,584
while I was in the john
or something.

1766
01:08:30,628 --> 01:08:32,064
You get him home.

1767
01:08:32,108 --> 01:08:34,066
Elena's on the warpath,
and she's got Sherry with her.

1768
01:08:34,110 --> 01:08:35,154
I'll take care
of it.

1769
01:08:35,198 --> 01:08:36,677
Now why am I guessing

1770
01:08:36,721 --> 01:08:38,462
you don't have
anything for me?

1771
01:08:38,505 --> 01:08:41,900
I will. I will.
It's just that, you know,

1772
01:08:41,943 --> 01:08:43,249
things didn't
work out, Fatty,
not like I planned.

1773
01:08:43,293 --> 01:08:45,033
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1774
01:08:45,077 --> 01:08:46,861
I just need
a little more time.
I'll get you the money.

1775
01:08:46,905 --> 01:08:49,342
Sure.

1776
01:08:49,386 --> 01:08:50,735
But you still gotta
take your lumps.

1777
01:08:50,778 --> 01:08:53,868
Look. Look.
I already got
two stitches.

1778
01:08:53,912 --> 01:08:55,435
I'll tell people that
you did this to me.

1779
01:08:55,479 --> 01:08:57,307
You sent it kind of like
a warning message.

1780
01:08:57,350 --> 01:08:59,135
I was late making a payment,
so you cut me.

1781
01:08:59,178 --> 01:09:01,267
Lies are
for punks, Jimmy.

1782
01:09:01,311 --> 01:09:03,791
You bashed me into
something sharp?

1783
01:09:03,835 --> 01:09:06,359
Sorry, Jimmy.
If you can't do the time--

1784
01:09:06,403 --> 01:09:08,405
Don't do the crime.
Yeah. I know. I know.

1785
01:09:08,448 --> 01:09:10,624
Maggie?
Come on, sis, please?

1786
01:09:10,668 --> 01:09:12,104
How bad's
it gonna be?

1787
01:09:12,148 --> 01:09:14,802
It's a beating.
It'll look worse
than it is.

1788
01:09:17,936 --> 01:09:18,850
Sorry, bro.

1789
01:09:18,893 --> 01:09:20,286
Sis!

1790
01:09:20,330 --> 01:09:21,766
It's Ray's money.

1791
01:09:21,809 --> 01:09:23,463
Ray. Please?

1792
01:09:23,507 --> 01:09:24,986
If Susan doesn't need it,
I won't keep it.

1793
01:09:25,030 --> 01:09:26,423
Come on.
Swallow your pride.

1794
01:09:26,466 --> 01:09:27,685
I'm gonna take
a beating here.

1795
01:09:27,728 --> 01:09:29,165
Take it.

1796
01:09:29,208 --> 01:09:31,297
It's Christmas, Ray.
Give it to charity.

1797
01:09:31,341 --> 01:09:32,994
Time to pay
the piper, Jimmy.

1798
01:09:33,038 --> 01:09:35,649
- Charity, huh?
- Fuck charity.
Give it to the piper.

1799
01:09:35,693 --> 01:09:37,999
You're talking to
the wrong guy, James.

1800
01:09:38,043 --> 01:09:39,697
Susan?

1801
01:09:39,740 --> 01:09:41,307
You're kidding,
right?

1802
01:09:41,351 --> 01:09:42,743
Minor?

1803
01:09:42,787 --> 01:09:44,441
Come on, anybody, please?
A little help here.

1804
01:09:44,484 --> 01:09:45,877
You made the bed.

1805
01:09:45,920 --> 01:09:47,357
Stop with the sayings!

1806
01:09:47,400 --> 01:09:48,749
Come out from
behind there!

1807
01:09:48,793 --> 01:09:50,186
There's got to be
another way.

1808
01:09:50,229 --> 01:09:51,491
There isn't!

1809
01:09:54,451 --> 01:09:56,322
Well, I...

1810
01:09:56,366 --> 01:09:58,019
I think that there
better be,

1811
01:09:58,063 --> 01:10:01,719
or I'm gonna do a little
bashing of my own, huh?

1812
01:10:01,762 --> 01:10:03,460
Put the bat down.

1813
01:10:03,503 --> 01:10:04,722
No fucking way.

1814
01:10:04,765 --> 01:10:07,290
Guys.

1815
01:10:07,333 --> 01:10:09,074
Stop right there.
I said stop!

1816
01:10:10,293 --> 01:10:12,556
Huh? Huh?

1817
01:10:12,599 --> 01:10:14,210
Everything's my fault,
right?

1818
01:10:14,253 --> 01:10:17,125
Well, I'm sick of it!

1819
01:10:17,169 --> 01:10:18,779
I didn't drop the pass
in the end zone.

1820
01:10:18,823 --> 01:10:20,607
I didn't miss
the fucking field goal.

1821
01:10:20,651 --> 01:10:22,435
So I'm gonna pay
when I'm good and ready.

1822
01:10:22,479 --> 01:10:24,437
You don't like it,
you can talk to "Louie" here.

1823
01:10:24,481 --> 01:10:27,701
All of youse, you got
a problem with me?
Too fucking bad!

1824
01:10:27,745 --> 01:10:28,833
I'm through being 
the whippin' boy.

1825
01:10:28,876 --> 01:10:30,574
Come on.

1826
01:10:30,617 --> 01:10:33,751
Come on, you mothers.
I'll take all of youse on, huh?

1827
01:10:38,408 --> 01:10:40,410
Oops, huh?

1828
01:10:40,453 --> 01:10:42,455
Fatty, I, uh,
I was--

1829
01:10:42,499 --> 01:10:43,674
Uh-hh!

1830
01:10:43,717 --> 01:10:44,979
My nose.

1831
01:10:45,023 --> 01:10:46,067
It'll give you
character.

1832
01:10:46,111 --> 01:10:48,766
Hey!

1833
01:10:48,809 --> 01:10:52,030
I'm responsible for
what happens in here.

1834
01:10:52,073 --> 01:10:54,162
- Yeah?
- Thank God.

1835
01:10:54,206 --> 01:10:55,512
Could you
take it outside?

1836
01:10:55,555 --> 01:10:56,948
Ray!

1837
01:10:56,991 --> 01:10:58,210
- Sorry. Sure.
- Come on.

1838
01:10:58,254 --> 01:10:59,907
I-- I!
Oh, jeez!

1839
01:11:01,300 --> 01:11:02,954
Ow!

1840
01:11:02,997 --> 01:11:05,391
You tried, kid.

1841
01:11:05,435 --> 01:11:06,958
What do I owe you
for the damage?

1842
01:11:07,001 --> 01:11:09,352
- It's on Jimmy's tab.
- Thanks.

1843
01:11:09,395 --> 01:11:11,310
Let's take a walk.

1844
01:11:11,354 --> 01:11:14,792
- Going somewhere, Fatty?
- Honey!

1845
01:11:14,835 --> 01:11:16,315
- Minor: Elena.
- How'd you find me?

1846
01:11:16,359 --> 01:11:18,186
Mothers are
all-knowing.

1847
01:11:18,230 --> 01:11:19,536
Take the gun
out of my pocket.

1848
01:11:19,579 --> 01:11:20,885
I don't want Elena
to find it.

1849
01:11:20,928 --> 01:11:23,844
After you hung up,
we "star-69'd."

1850
01:11:23,888 --> 01:11:25,237
"Hi-Life Bar and Grill."

1851
01:11:25,281 --> 01:11:27,457
You've had enough beating.
Use it to get out of here.

1852
01:11:27,500 --> 01:11:28,545
Where do I go?

1853
01:11:28,588 --> 01:11:30,286
Somewhere where people
might like you.

1854
01:11:30,329 --> 01:11:31,939
What are you getting
busted for?

1855
01:11:31,983 --> 01:11:33,593
I bet on Notre Dame.

1856
01:11:33,637 --> 01:11:34,942
Oh!

1857
01:11:34,986 --> 01:11:36,379
Yeah.

1858
01:11:36,422 --> 01:11:38,381
The fat one here's
taking book.

1859
01:11:38,424 --> 01:11:40,208
Oh, Sherry, I can--

1860
01:11:40,252 --> 01:11:43,603
Explain? No.
You can pay.

1861
01:11:43,647 --> 01:11:46,737
We had an agreement.
No shady action.

1862
01:11:46,780 --> 01:11:50,262
So you can
close the book
as of exactly now,

1863
01:11:50,306 --> 01:11:54,745
or you can start
paying alimony
as of exactly soon.

1864
01:11:54,788 --> 01:11:57,922
Oh, all right, honey.

1865
01:11:57,965 --> 01:12:00,794
- "All right, honey," what?
- No more book.

1866
01:12:00,838 --> 01:12:03,231
Is this retroactive?
Does that mean
I'm off the hook?

1867
01:12:03,275 --> 01:12:04,711
Yeah.

1868
01:12:04,755 --> 01:12:07,323
- Not with me.
- Too bad.

1869
01:12:07,366 --> 01:12:10,326
Excuse me. Excuse me.
I think I'm following
all this,

1870
01:12:10,369 --> 01:12:11,936
but which one of you
is pregnant?

1871
01:12:13,851 --> 01:12:15,853
It's me.

1872
01:12:15,896 --> 01:12:17,594
What?

1873
01:12:17,637 --> 01:12:19,335
I'm carrying
your child.

1874
01:12:19,378 --> 01:12:20,423
10 weeks.

1875
01:12:23,164 --> 01:12:24,949
Oh, my God!
It's a heart attack!

1876
01:12:24,992 --> 01:12:26,298
Clear the way!
Paramedics!

1877
01:12:26,342 --> 01:12:27,386
We're EMS.
Don't panic.

1878
01:12:27,430 --> 01:12:29,083
We know what
we're doing.

1879
01:12:29,127 --> 01:12:32,348
You got pregnant?
What are you thinking?
You're too old.

1880
01:12:32,391 --> 01:12:34,437
Don't push it,
Ricardo.

1881
01:12:34,480 --> 01:12:35,873
Is he all right?

1882
01:12:35,916 --> 01:12:37,788
He probably
just fainted.

1883
01:12:37,831 --> 01:12:39,311
We'll determine that.

1884
01:12:39,355 --> 01:12:40,965
Get him
some brandy.

1885
01:12:41,008 --> 01:12:43,141
What is it?
Is he okay?

1886
01:12:43,184 --> 01:12:44,185
This man's been shot.

1887
01:12:44,229 --> 01:12:45,404
Oh, my God!

1888
01:12:45,448 --> 01:12:46,971
It's all right.
It's okay.

1889
01:12:47,014 --> 01:12:48,625
He's already
been patched up.

1890
01:12:48,668 --> 01:12:50,453
It's probably
just a weakness
from loss of blood.

1891
01:12:50,496 --> 01:12:51,715
- Minor: Elena.
- Yes?

1892
01:12:51,758 --> 01:12:54,021
Sweetie. Yes.
I'm here.

1893
01:12:54,065 --> 01:12:56,937
- We're having a baby?
- That's the story.

1894
01:12:56,981 --> 01:12:58,243
But when did we...

1895
01:12:58,286 --> 01:12:59,940
you know, when did
we not use...

1896
01:12:59,984 --> 01:13:02,682
That night after the Mets
doubleheader. Remember?

1897
01:13:02,726 --> 01:13:03,683
The sweep.

1898
01:13:03,727 --> 01:13:06,643
Yeah.
Here, take this.

1899
01:13:08,688 --> 01:13:10,777
- We gotta get married.
- Sure.

1900
01:13:10,821 --> 01:13:12,605
Like, tomorrow.
We don't want the kid
doing the math,

1901
01:13:12,649 --> 01:13:15,129
thinking that
he was an accident.
That's not right.

1902
01:13:15,173 --> 01:13:17,523
Whatever you
think's best.

1903
01:13:17,567 --> 01:13:20,961
Wow. The bake sales
were worth it.

1904
01:13:21,005 --> 01:13:22,485
People.

1905
01:13:24,487 --> 01:13:26,445
This is a good time
for me to be leaving.

1906
01:13:26,489 --> 01:13:28,142
Jesus.

1907
01:13:28,186 --> 01:13:30,014
I believe you mentioned
something about a car.

1908
01:13:30,057 --> 01:13:31,363
Could I have
the keys, please?

1909
01:13:31,407 --> 01:13:32,843
It's an
'82 Rabbit.

1910
01:13:32,886 --> 01:13:34,235
Keys.

1911
01:13:34,279 --> 01:13:36,977
Nice and slow.
Slow.

1912
01:13:37,021 --> 01:13:39,153
Or what, huh?

1913
01:13:39,197 --> 01:13:41,678
You take the car,
I call the police,
they pull you over.

1914
01:13:41,721 --> 01:13:44,811
Or I take you with me
till I get somewhere, huh?

1915
01:13:44,855 --> 01:13:46,465
Jimmy, you're not
a kidnapper.

1916
01:13:46,509 --> 01:13:48,859
You're not
a car thief.
You're an actor.

1917
01:13:48,902 --> 01:13:51,949
Yeah, and this actor's
going to L.A.

1918
01:13:51,992 --> 01:13:54,038
For good?

1919
01:13:54,081 --> 01:13:56,780
I might come back
after I make it big,
do a little Broadway.

1920
01:13:56,823 --> 01:13:59,913
Here. Keep it.
It's a gift.

1921
01:13:59,957 --> 01:14:02,089
Great.

1922
01:14:02,133 --> 01:14:05,832
Suze, sorry things didn't
pan out between us.

Thanks.

Tell Mom and Dad I'll call 'em on Christmas.

A friend of Ricky's
had fallen in with
the wrong crowd.

1939
01:15:08,939 --> 01:15:11,550
Ricky asked me
to help him set
his friend straight.

1940
01:15:11,594 --> 01:15:13,247
But some of the wrong
crowd showed up,

1941
01:15:13,291 --> 01:15:15,467
and, well...

1942
01:15:15,511 --> 01:15:17,513
he's a good kid,
Elena.

1943
01:15:17,556 --> 01:15:19,645
He was a little
reckless,

1944
01:15:19,689 --> 01:15:21,560
but he was trying
to help a friend.

1945
01:15:21,604 --> 01:15:23,301
I think he learned
his lesson.

1946
01:15:23,344 --> 01:15:24,520
I did.

1947
01:15:24,563 --> 01:15:25,738
All right.

1948
01:15:25,782 --> 01:15:28,001
But nothing like this
better happen again.

1949
01:15:28,045 --> 01:15:29,960
It won't.

1950
01:15:30,003 --> 01:15:32,658
Thanks... Dad.

01:15:32,702 --> 01:15:35,835
Sure... son.

1952
01:15:35,879 --> 01:15:38,795
We're gonna be
the happiest family
in the whole city.

1953
01:15:38,838 --> 01:15:40,710
You bet, honey.

1954
01:15:42,625 --> 01:15:44,496
I love you,
Clarence.

1955
01:15:44,540 --> 01:15:46,542
I love you, too.

1956
01:15:49,370 --> 01:15:51,372
Let's go home.

1957
01:15:52,852 --> 01:15:54,854
Well,
I had no idea
this place

1958
01:15:54,898 --> 01:15:56,900
was so lively
around closing time.

1959
01:15:56,943 --> 01:15:58,902
I still think Jimmy
got off pretty easy.

1960
01:15:58,945 --> 01:16:00,251
Yeah, but he's
moving to L.A.

1961
01:16:00,294 --> 01:16:02,340
That's punishment
enough.

1962
01:16:02,383 --> 01:16:04,037
Want me to walk
you home?

1963
01:16:04,081 --> 01:16:06,039
Actually, could you
lend me the cab fare?

1964
01:16:06,083 --> 01:16:07,519
I thought you lived
around the corner?

1965
01:16:07,563 --> 01:16:10,609
I do.
I'm teasing.

1966
01:16:10,653 --> 01:16:12,568
Well,
come on, then.

1967
01:16:17,007 --> 01:16:18,617
Phil: I couldn't believe the way he treated you.

1968
01:16:18,661 --> 01:16:20,227
I wanted to...

1969
01:16:20,271 --> 01:16:23,013
Sure, but you can't
hold Jimmy to your
standards. He's--

1970
01:16:23,056 --> 01:16:24,449
An actor.
I know.

1971
01:16:24,492 --> 01:16:26,016
A struggling
actor.

1972
01:16:26,059 --> 01:16:27,147
So it's like
he has this gift

1973
01:16:27,191 --> 01:16:28,409
he wants
to give away,

1974
01:16:28,453 --> 01:16:29,889
but nobody
will accept it.

1975
01:16:29,933 --> 01:16:31,456
Granted,
the gift is
himself,

1976
01:16:31,499 --> 01:16:33,893
but that's
what he values
the most.

1977
01:16:33,937 --> 01:16:36,504
I guess.

1978
01:16:36,548 --> 01:16:38,463
He was well-groomed.

1979
01:16:41,901 --> 01:16:43,816
You've already
forgiven him,
haven't you?

1980
01:16:43,860 --> 01:16:46,210
Sure.
He is what he is.
Things happen.

1981
01:16:46,253 --> 01:16:49,953
I made new
friends and--

1982
01:16:49,996 --> 01:16:53,696
no, I haven't
forgiven him.

1983
01:16:56,263 --> 01:16:57,656
But I'll be
relieved when I do,

1984
01:16:57,700 --> 01:16:59,832
because it'll be
the last time
I have to.

1985
01:17:03,575 --> 01:17:06,665
So, you guys want to
come up to my roof

1986
01:17:06,709 --> 01:17:10,538
and wait for
the sunrise?

1987
01:17:10,582 --> 01:17:12,976
Oh. Uh...

1988
01:17:13,019 --> 01:17:15,239
yeah, sure.
Sure.

1989
01:17:15,282 --> 01:17:17,894
Cool.

1990
01:17:22,376 --> 01:17:26,163
So what are you gonna do
with all the loot
you collected?

1991
01:17:26,206 --> 01:17:28,252
600 I'll give to
Toys for Tots,

1992
01:17:28,295 --> 01:17:31,385
or the Police
Athletic League--
something for kids.

1993
01:17:31,429 --> 01:17:33,561
The rest I'll probably
spend on presents.

1994
01:17:33,605 --> 01:17:34,824
That's very
selfish of you.

1995
01:17:34,867 --> 01:17:36,913
What?

1996
01:17:36,956 --> 01:17:39,524
I just mean that
it's typical you'd
give it all away.

1997
01:17:39,567 --> 01:17:40,786
Yeah,
I'm gullible.

1998
01:17:40,830 --> 01:17:42,135
Or generous.

1999
01:17:42,179 --> 01:17:43,876
This is me.

2000
01:17:43,920 --> 01:17:45,356
Well, this is me,

2001
01:17:45,399 --> 01:17:49,055
but, um, this is
me as well.

2002
01:17:49,099 --> 01:17:50,448
Okay.
Good night.

2003
01:17:50,491 --> 01:17:52,711
Good night.

2004
01:17:52,755 --> 01:17:54,539
Ray?

2005
01:17:54,582 --> 01:17:56,106
Yeah?

2006
01:17:58,456 --> 01:17:59,849
What do youwant
for Christmas?

2007
01:18:04,767 --> 01:18:06,159
You want the truth?

2008
01:18:08,335 --> 01:18:09,728
Only if you
whisper it.

2009
01:18:17,040 --> 01:18:18,432
You.

2010
01:18:18,476 --> 01:18:19,912
What?

2011
01:18:19,956 --> 01:18:23,568
I want you
for Christmas.

2012
01:18:23,611 --> 01:18:27,920
You do? Oh.
Well, I'm glad.

2013
01:18:27,964 --> 01:18:30,749
- You are?
- Mm-hmm.

2014
01:18:30,793 --> 01:18:33,447
I won't have to shop,
and...

2015
01:18:33,491 --> 01:18:35,319

to unwrap.
