00:07:58,708 --> 00:08:01,875
So... I will give him the weekend
to redo his project.

169
00:08:02,291 --> 00:08:05,291
- That seems fair.
- [Mrs. W] He can present again on Monday.

170
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:07,083
- Hm.
- Well, I appreciate that.

171
00:08:07,583 --> 00:08:08,625
And she's gone.

172
00:08:08,958 --> 00:08:10,833
- [window rolling up]
- [sighs]

173
00:08:10,916 --> 00:08:13,583
Alright. Everybody, buckle up,
the correct way.

174
00:08:13,666 --> 00:08:16,041
- [door unlocks]
- [indistinct chatter]

175
00:08:16,458 --> 00:08:19,708
- [Kevin] Who puts ketchup on pizza?
- [Dad] OK, Kevin. [laughs]

176
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:22,041
- Hey, hon!
- Hey, guys.

177
00:08:22,125 --> 00:08:25,000
[Dad] You should've seen me.
I was a tiger in the carpool line.

178
00:08:25,083 --> 00:08:26,708
[Mom] You are the king of carpool.

179
00:08:27,125 --> 00:08:29,291
[Dad] Guess what.
I had a chat with Mrs. W.

180
00:08:29,375 --> 00:08:32,458
- Kevin's at it again.
- Kevin, are you telling tales again?

181
00:08:32,541 --> 00:08:35,500
- How was lunch duty today?
- [Mom] You know, same as usual.

182
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:38,750
Actually, an 8th grader got into trouble
with his phone. I had...

183
00:08:38,833 --> 00:08:41,208
Wow! An 8th grader has a phone,
and I don't.

184
00:08:41,625 --> 00:08:44,583
Mom, can we talk about this?
Please. It's time. I need a phone.

185
00:08:44,666 --> 00:08:47,791
I'm literally the only one in my grade
without one. I'm a total freak.

186
00:08:47,916 --> 00:08:50,500
Just 'cause you don't have a phone,
doesn't make you a freak.

187
00:08:50,583 --> 00:08:53,333
Mmm... It's not like
"sit with the counselor at lunch

188
00:08:53,416 --> 00:08:55,708
'cause you stink like cheese" freak, but...

189
00:08:55,791 --> 00:08:58,333
You know, in high school
we had this foreign exchange student

190
00:08:58,416 --> 00:09:00,750
who smelled like cheese.
We called him Frankie Fromage.

191
00:09:00,833 --> 00:09:02,583
- [Mom laughs]
- Ew, Dad! Mom!

192
00:09:02,666 --> 00:09:05,375
- He liked it. Frankie Fromage.
- Focus! Phone.

193
00:09:05,458 --> 00:09:08,000
Honey, we've been over this.
What do you need a phone for?

194
00:09:08,083 --> 00:09:11,041
Travis Schultz asked for her number
to invite her to his party.

195
00:09:11,125 --> 00:09:13,583
Do you know what that means?
He's a senior.

196
00:09:13,666 --> 00:09:14,666
[whispers] Senior.

197
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:16,875
Wait, a senior? Who? What?

198
00:09:16,958 --> 00:09:18,583
- Travis who? What party?
- [Mim] Hmm?

199
00:09:18,666 --> 00:09:20,791
What? No. What party? No parties.

200
00:09:20,875 --> 00:09:22,625
- [mouths] Sorry.
- Are his parents be there?

201
00:09:22,708 --> 00:09:25,708
- Oh my God. I don't know, Mom.
- [Dad] We can call his parents.

202
00:09:25,791 --> 00:09:26,958
We should call his parents.

203
00:09:27,041 --> 00:09:29,291
- We should call everybody.
- Oh my God. Don't do that.

204
00:09:29,375 --> 00:09:32,625
Absolutely not. Do not call anybody.
That's <i>so </i>embarrassing.

205
00:09:33,041 --> 00:09:34,166
Honey, listen...

206
00:09:35,208 --> 00:09:38,250
I know you think I don't get it,
but I was 15 once too.

207
00:09:38,666 --> 00:09:40,625
I know a thing or two about parties.

208
00:09:40,708 --> 00:09:42,541
- [snorts] Really?
- Yeah.

209
00:09:42,625 --> 00:09:46,000
All you ever talk about is how you spent
every waking moment in the library.

210
00:09:46,083 --> 00:09:48,125
Yeah, well, you know,
parties came and went,

211
00:09:48,208 --> 00:09:49,750
but the library was always there for me.

212
00:09:49,833 --> 00:09:51,833
[sighs] You're about to quote
your dead poet guy.

213
00:09:51,916 --> 00:09:54,791
- "There are no strangers here, just…"
- [both] "Friends you haven't met."

214
00:09:54,875 --> 00:09:56,083
William Butler Yeats.

215
00:09:56,166 --> 00:10:00,208
Feel like if you can quote that by heart,
you <i>didn't </i>go to a lot of parties.

216
00:10:00,291 --> 00:10:02,208
No parents, no parties.

217
00:10:02,291 --> 00:10:06,041
- Come on! Nobody else's mom even cares.
- Well, I'm not everyone else's mom.

218
00:10:06,125 --> 00:10:09,250
Obviously! Everybody else's moms
have a life of their own,

219
00:10:09,333 --> 00:10:11,833
not worrying
about what their daughter is doing

220
00:10:11,916 --> 00:10:14,708
and the scary things that might happen.
[laughs] God, it's pathetic!

221
00:10:14,791 --> 00:10:17,333
- [Dad] Hey.
- Oh, so, I'm pathetic?

222
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,083
Yeah. It's sad.

223
00:10:19,166 --> 00:10:21,666
You know what else is sad?
You're grounded.

224
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:23,083
Yeah, you're grounded!

225
00:10:23,583 --> 00:10:24,458
[groans]

226
00:10:24,541 --> 00:10:25,875
[stomps feet]

227
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:27,708
[sighs] She hates me.

228
00:10:28,208 --> 00:10:29,625
Oh, come on, honey…

229
00:10:29,708 --> 00:10:31,083
[sighs]

230
00:10:31,166 --> 00:10:32,333
[groans]

231
00:10:33,166 --> 00:10:35,416
[sighs] She's ruining my life, Mim.

232
00:10:35,791 --> 00:10:38,208
- Yeah, baby. She's cray.
- [sighs]

233
00:10:38,291 --> 00:10:41,416
She lose it when you told her
you were going to Boston for the summer?

234
00:10:44,791 --> 00:10:47,625
- You didn't ask her, did you?
- [sighs]

235
00:10:47,708 --> 00:10:50,666
- Clancy, do you even wanna go?
- Yes, of course! I…

236
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:54,291
[sighs] I mean, I'm probably
not gonna get accepted anyway.

237
00:10:55,166 --> 00:10:58,166
The Berklee Summer Workshop
is a really prestigious music program.

238
00:10:58,250 --> 00:11:01,583
They get a ton of applicants every year
and very few get accepted.

239
00:11:01,666 --> 00:11:02,625
[Mim] Clance...

240
00:11:03,833 --> 00:11:05,833
You're the best cellist I've ever seen.

241
00:11:05,916 --> 00:11:07,833
[scoffs] OK.

242
00:11:09,291 --> 00:11:13,541
I might be the best cellist
in our tiny, little corner on Cape Cod.

243
00:11:14,083 --> 00:11:18,291
Know what I think? You're secretly glad
your mother never lets you go anywhere

244
00:11:18,375 --> 00:11:21,083
or do anything, 'cause then
you don't have to put yourself out there.

245
00:11:21,166 --> 00:11:22,708
Wha... That's so not true.

246
00:11:22,791 --> 00:11:25,500
[Mom] Mim! She's grounded. Time to go.

247
00:11:25,583 --> 00:11:27,458
- [Clancy sighs]
- Great.

248
00:11:28,583 --> 00:11:29,500
Then prove it.

249
00:11:30,541 --> 00:11:33,125
We are sneaking out
to Travis's party tonight.

250
00:11:33,208 --> 00:11:34,791
- Mi...
- [Mim] Shh! Yes. Yes.

251
00:11:34,875 --> 00:11:37,791
Put on your skinny jeans
and your red tank.

252
00:11:39,166 --> 00:11:41,458
- Love you.
- [Clancy] Love you, too.

253
00:11:41,875 --> 00:11:43,041
[chuckles softly]

254
00:11:43,125 --> 00:11:44,500
[upbeat pop music plays]

255
00:11:48,458 --> 00:11:50,000
- [knocking]
- [dog barks]

256
00:11:50,083 --> 00:11:53,000
- [Dad] Angus, stop! Angus! Calm down!
- [dog barking]

257
00:11:53,083 --> 00:11:54,875
[Dad] Angus, heel! [groans]

258
00:11:55,541 --> 00:11:56,458
[door slams]

259
00:11:56,541 --> 00:11:58,916
- [dog barking]
- [Dad] Sit. Heel! Heel! Heel!

260
00:11:59,375 --> 00:12:02,208
[yelps] Ah, he got me! Get down! Lay down!

261
00:12:02,583 --> 00:12:03,875
Stay! I'm the alpha!

262
00:12:03,958 --> 00:12:05,416
- [chuckles]
- [dog barking]

263
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:08,416
[breathless] Ah... animals. [chuckles]

264
00:12:08,791 --> 00:12:11,041
- Hey, Lewis. What's happenin'?
- Hi.

265
00:12:11,125 --> 00:12:13,875
Kevin's is very excited
about tonight's sleepover.

266
00:12:13,958 --> 00:12:15,291
Thanks for inviting him.

267
00:12:15,666 --> 00:12:18,083
- Here's a bag with some of his stuff.
- Great.

268
00:12:18,166 --> 00:12:20,750
[woman] Including his special
nighttime underpants,

269
00:12:20,833 --> 00:12:23,250
which have sensors
that sound a small alarm

270
00:12:23,333 --> 00:12:25,125
- when they get wet.
- Ah. That's cute.

271
00:12:25,208 --> 00:12:28,000
Lewis has a bit of a problem with
[whispers] wetting the bed.

272
00:12:28,083 --> 00:12:28,916
Mom!

273
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,041
Oh, don't worry about it, buddy.
It happens to the best of 'em.

274
00:12:32,125 --> 00:12:34,250
It happens to me
from time to time. [laughs]

275
00:12:34,333 --> 00:12:36,500
Ron! Get your prostate checked.

276
00:12:36,958 --> 00:12:38,250
Oh, no, I was, I was…

277
00:12:39,625 --> 00:12:40,833
Ye... I will. I should.

278
00:12:40,916 --> 00:12:43,833
- I definitely should. I will. Uh, K-Kevin!
- Uh-huh.

279
00:12:43,916 --> 00:12:44,750
Lewis is here!

280
00:12:45,208 --> 00:12:47,958
- Come down. Quickly. Like the wind, boy.
- [footsteps]

281
00:12:48,041 --> 00:12:49,875
[chuckles] Come on, buddy.

282
00:12:49,958 --> 00:12:51,583
- [dog barking]
- No.

283
00:12:51,666 --> 00:12:53,875
- [woman] Bye, honey! Be careful.
- [Kevin] Let's go!

284
00:12:53,958 --> 00:12:57,458
Those guys are like the three musketeers,
without, you know, the...

285
00:12:57,875 --> 00:12:59,458
I'll collect him in the morning.

286
00:12:59,541 --> 00:13:01,416
- Eight o'clock sharp.
- OK.

287
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:02,875
[forced chuckle]

288
00:13:02,958 --> 00:13:04,166
He'll be fine.

289
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:06,750
- [video game music playing]
- [Kevin] Ooh...

290
00:13:06,833 --> 00:13:08,166
Right at the video games.

291
00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:11,291
How about you guys
do something a bit more, uh, productive?

292
00:13:11,375 --> 00:13:13,708
We are! We just took over Tilted Town.

293
00:13:14,291 --> 00:13:16,125
I meant something a little more physical.

294
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:18,416
- My guy's running.
- [Ron laughs]

295
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:21,625
OK, Kevin, I think that this is
what Mrs. W was talking about.

296
00:13:21,708 --> 00:13:24,958
You spend way too much time
in these imaginary worlds.

297
00:13:25,041 --> 00:13:28,416
Why don't you go outside into
the real world and run around a bit?

298
00:13:28,708 --> 00:13:30,500
Oh... Here, Mr. Finch.

299
00:13:30,875 --> 00:13:32,958
- What's this?
- A list of my known allergens.

300
00:13:33,041 --> 00:13:34,666
It's laminated for protection.

301
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:37,416
Mom was concerned
about your cavalier parenting style.

302
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:39,250
- It means...
- I know what it means.

303
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:43,250
OK. I'll make it simple. How about this?
Who wants pizza for dinner?

304
00:13:43,333 --> 00:13:44,208
Me!

305
00:13:44,291 --> 00:13:47,666
- I'm not allowed half-processed cheeses.
- Well, Lewis, it'll be our little secret.

306
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:50,875
- I'm not allowed to have secrets.
- Oh, it's gonna be a long night.

307
00:13:51,583 --> 00:13:54,875
Honey, I mean, almond milk, soy milk...

308
00:13:54,958 --> 00:13:57,541
Can we just get regular milk for once?

309
00:13:58,208 --> 00:14:00,916
You can't just squeeze something
and call it milk.

310
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,166
- That's just nut water.
- [toilet flushing in video]

311
00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:05,750
You like nut wa... What? Wait a minute.

312
00:14:05,833 --> 00:14:07,083
[Kevin]<i> It was a joke.</i>

313
00:14:07,166 --> 00:14:08,750
H-honey, honey, I-I gotta go.

314
00:14:08,833 --> 00:14:10,208
<i>Everything OK here, boys?</i>

315
00:14:10,583 --> 00:14:14,291
[silly music playing]

316
00:14:14,666 --> 00:14:16,250
Oh, crap!

317
00:14:16,666 --> 00:14:17,541
[doorbell rings]

318
00:14:17,625 --> 00:14:20,166
- [dog barking]
- Hey! No! Angus, no! Angus! Angus!

319
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:22,125
- Whoa!
- No! Stop! No!

320
00:14:22,208 --> 00:14:25,333
[pizza guy] Here you go, bud.
I happen to have a dog treat for ya.

321
00:14:25,416 --> 00:14:28,250
Gotta be prepared for anything
in this line of work, man.

322
00:14:28,333 --> 00:14:30,458
That was impressive. [laughs]

323
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,875
- What do I owe ya?
- Uh, it's gonna be 18.45.

324
00:14:33,958 --> 00:14:36,625
Forty-five. You got it. I have… Oh...

325
00:14:37,333 --> 00:14:40,791
- I only have a twenty. That's a bad tip.
- Oh, don't sweat it.

326
00:14:40,875 --> 00:14:43,208
No, no, no, I don't wanna be that guy.

327
00:14:43,291 --> 00:14:45,500
Take that, but don't go.
Hold on. Take this.

328
00:14:45,583 --> 00:14:48,333
I own the bakery on Wyndhurst.
Stop by, OK?

329
00:14:48,416 --> 00:14:50,375
- Anything you want, on the house.
- OK.

330
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:52,625
- Cool. Thank you, man.
- [Ron chuckles] Cool, man.

331
00:14:52,708 --> 00:14:53,666
Nice guy.

332
00:14:56,625 --> 00:14:57,791
[sighs]

333
00:14:57,875 --> 00:14:59,041
[phone beeps]

334
00:14:59,458 --> 00:15:02,625
[bass guitar strumming]

335
00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:08,750
[in British accent] It's her.

336
00:15:09,708 --> 00:15:11,791
- [snoring]
- [engine starts]

337
00:15:14,666 --> 00:15:18,083
Wow! You guys picked
the perfect night for a campout.

338
00:15:18,166 --> 00:15:20,000
[chuckles] This is gonna be so cool.

339
00:15:20,083 --> 00:15:23,541
- I don't get why we're being punished.
- Kev, you're not being punished.

340
00:15:23,625 --> 00:15:25,666
- It's fun. It's an adventure.
- Uh, Mr. Finch.

341
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:29,166
I'm not allowed to play in unfamiliar
frontier settings unsupervised.

342
00:15:29,250 --> 00:15:31,750
Good news, it's not a frontier.
You're in our backyard.

343
00:15:31,833 --> 00:15:34,000
There's a fence.
You're gonna be perfectly safe.

344
00:15:34,083 --> 00:15:36,000
Come on, guys. Inside.

345
00:15:36,833 --> 00:15:38,125
There you go. You got it.

346
00:15:40,708 --> 00:15:43,333
Look at this tent.
We haven't used this tent in ages.

347
00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:46,708
Yeah, because it sucks!
There are bugs everywhere.

348
00:15:46,791 --> 00:15:50,375
- That thing's cocooning!
- There are not bugs everywhere! Ju... Oh!

349
00:15:56,625 --> 00:15:57,583
[Ron blowing]

350
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,458
There he goes...
just back to his little spot, see?

351
00:16:01,541 --> 00:16:04,125
Do me a favor.
Sleep with your mouths closed, OK?

352
00:16:04,208 --> 00:16:07,375
Anyway, have a good time, guys!
This is fun! Camping out!

353
00:16:08,083 --> 00:16:10,083
[suspenseful, exciting music plays]

354
00:16:27,458 --> 00:16:28,291
What now?

355
00:16:29,791 --> 00:16:32,166
- We could tell scary stories.
- OK.

356
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:34,750
That sounds cool.

357
00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:37,333
You go first.

358
00:16:37,416 --> 00:16:38,833
- [crunching]
- [bird squawks]

359
00:16:39,208 --> 00:16:40,041
What was that?

360
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:42,750
Air? Wolf?

361
00:16:42,833 --> 00:16:43,916
- [crunching]
- Badger?

362
00:16:44,333 --> 00:16:46,333
- Probably not a badger.
- Alien?

363
00:16:47,208 --> 00:16:48,875
With hooks for hands?

364
00:16:49,375 --> 00:16:50,708
[both scream]

365
00:16:51,083 --> 00:16:53,250
- [Mim laughs] My God!
- [Kevin] Jeez, Mim.

366
00:16:53,333 --> 00:16:56,166
- [both panting]
- [Mim] Oh, you guys should see your faces.

367
00:16:56,250 --> 00:16:58,125
What are you little turds doin' out here?

368
00:16:58,208 --> 00:17:00,875
- S-sleeping in the tent.
- Duh. Why?

369
00:17:00,958 --> 00:17:03,458
My dad thinks it's good for us,
or something.

370
00:17:03,541 --> 00:17:05,041
[scoffs] Parents are so weird.

371
00:17:05,125 --> 00:17:07,166
[chuckles softly] What are you doing?

372
00:17:07,250 --> 00:17:10,041
Sneaking out, obviously. Cute jammies.

373
00:17:24,333 --> 00:17:26,166
[metal squeaking]

374
00:17:27,916 --> 00:17:30,083
- Busted!
- [sheepish giggle]

375
00:17:30,166 --> 00:17:33,666
- Sorry, I was just, uh...
- Oh... I know what you were doing.

376
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:37,333
You were trying to sneak one of these.

377
00:17:37,666 --> 00:17:40,416
- Yes. [chuckles]
- Yes! I know.

378
00:17:40,625 --> 00:17:41,458
Every time

379
00:17:41,541 --> 00:17:45,333
I bake a new tester recipe, there's always
one or two missing in the morning.

380
00:17:45,416 --> 00:17:48,375
I always thought it was Kevin,
but now I know, it's my daughter.

381
00:17:48,458 --> 00:17:50,875
[chuckles] Guilty.

382
00:17:51,125 --> 00:17:52,958
OK... [smacks lips]

383
00:17:53,041 --> 00:17:55,166
Brown sugar, banana,
with avocado frosting.

384
00:17:55,250 --> 00:17:56,625
Gettin' crazy, Dad.

385
00:17:56,708 --> 00:17:59,208
A little wild, but tell me what you think.

386
00:18:02,083 --> 00:18:04,250
You were a little hard on Mom tonight.

387
00:18:05,666 --> 00:18:06,958
She was hard on me.

388
00:18:07,458 --> 00:18:09,250
She grounded me for no reason.

389
00:18:09,333 --> 00:18:12,166
Well, she had her reasons.
You can't talk to Mom like that.

390
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,333
You know, you two are more alike
than you know.

391
00:18:15,875 --> 00:18:17,291
[Clancy chuckles softly]

392
00:18:17,708 --> 00:18:18,541
OK.

393
00:18:19,333 --> 00:18:22,458
Alright, enough with the lecture.
What do you think? [sighs]

394
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,000
- It's actually really good.
- Good! I picked the right profession.

395
00:18:26,083 --> 00:18:27,708
- [laughs] Yeah.
- [Ron laughs]

396
00:18:27,791 --> 00:18:29,541
Alright. Well, you finish that one.

397
00:18:29,625 --> 00:18:31,791
- Do not touch any of the other ones.
- OK.

398
00:18:32,208 --> 00:18:34,583
- If Kevin asks, you were never here.
- [chuckles]

399
00:18:34,666 --> 00:18:36,458
- Alright. Don't stay up too late.
- OK.

400
00:18:36,541 --> 00:18:38,416
- Alright. I love you.
- Love you, too.

401
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:40,958
[footsteps moving away]

402
00:18:41,041 --> 00:18:45,208
[suspenseful music playing]

403
00:18:51,583 --> 00:18:53,833
So... where you sneakin' out to?

404
00:18:53,916 --> 00:18:57,833
You sneakin' out to meet a guy? Dude? Man?

405
00:18:57,916 --> 00:19:00,875
Don't tell him anything.
He's just gonna tell on us.

406
00:19:00,958 --> 00:19:03,000
- He's a total tattletale.
- I am not!

407
00:19:03,083 --> 00:19:05,208
And we sneak out all the time, right?

408
00:19:06,625 --> 00:19:07,708
You do not sneak out.

409
00:19:07,791 --> 00:19:11,625
- You're too afraid of the dark.
- [mouth full] No, we love the dark. Right?

410
00:19:11,708 --> 00:19:14,458
Says the boy with the Captain America
night-light in his room.

411
00:19:14,541 --> 00:19:17,333
Hey, it's not a night-light,
it's an area illuminator,

412
00:19:17,416 --> 00:19:20,250
in case I have to pee
or get a drink in the middle of the night.

413
00:19:20,333 --> 00:19:22,500
[Clancy] He makes crap up. He's a liar.

414
00:19:22,916 --> 00:19:24,625
[Kevin] I'm telling Mom
you called me a liar.

415
00:19:24,708 --> 00:19:26,000
I have to use the restroom.

416
00:19:26,083 --> 00:19:27,958
- Don't look at the Gatorade.
- [girls] Oh!

417
00:19:28,041 --> 00:19:29,958
[Lewis] You got this. You're a big boy!

418
00:19:30,041 --> 00:19:30,875
[door sliding]

419
00:19:35,958 --> 00:19:38,333
- [car approaching]
- [mysterious music plays]

420
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,791
- Dog?
- Neutralized.

421
00:20:00,166 --> 00:20:01,166
[lock clicks]

422
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:10,083
[sighs]

423
00:20:11,875 --> 00:20:12,708
Come on, Lewis.

424
00:20:13,458 --> 00:20:16,333
You've had nothing to drink since noon.
Yesterday.

425
00:20:16,416 --> 00:20:17,708
You got this, man!

426
00:20:18,458 --> 00:20:20,166
[whispers] OK, here we go.

427
00:20:21,833 --> 00:20:22,666
[sighs]

428
00:20:26,666 --> 00:20:27,583
Hey, Clancy?

429
00:20:27,958 --> 00:20:31,000
[menacing music playing]

430
00:20:31,083 --> 00:20:32,458
Like mother, like daughter.

431
00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:36,083
[gasps]

432
00:20:37,458 --> 00:20:38,583
[panting]

433
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,458
[man grunts]

434
00:20:41,625 --> 00:20:42,625
[Mom grunts]

435
00:20:45,083 --> 00:20:47,250
[door creaks]

436
00:20:48,541 --> 00:20:50,583
- [Mom grunts]
- [man groans]

437
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,208
- [grunts]
- [clatter]

438
00:20:55,333 --> 00:20:57,125
[both panting]

439
00:20:57,208 --> 00:20:59,041
Are you gonna kill me with carbs?

440
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:00,541
- [groans]
- [smashes]

441
00:21:00,625 --> 00:21:02,125
[man growls and laughs]

442
00:21:03,458 --> 00:21:05,666
- Should have brought backup.
- [woman] He did.

443
00:21:10,958 --> 00:21:12,625
Hey. Is this about the tip?

444
00:21:12,708 --> 00:21:14,208
Hello again, Mathilde.

445
00:21:15,083 --> 00:21:16,791
Mathilde? No, that's Margot.

446
00:21:16,875 --> 00:21:18,583
Oh! OK. I understand.

447
00:21:18,666 --> 00:21:22,666
So, apparently this is...
[sighs] a huge misunderstanding.

448
00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:24,875
I see you've met my friend Baxter.

449
00:21:24,958 --> 00:21:28,250
Jean-Paul asked us to swing by,
get the old band back together.

450
00:21:28,333 --> 00:21:31,500
- No, thanks. [sighs]
- Honey, you know these two?

451
00:21:31,583 --> 00:21:34,958
The crown of Durámuran, it's here.

452
00:21:35,041 --> 00:21:37,875
Looks like you'll get
one more shot at it after all.

453
00:21:38,541 --> 00:21:41,416
I really think that you guys
are in the wrong place.

454
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:44,541
You're talking about crowns.
The Neidmeyers live two houses down.

455
00:21:44,625 --> 00:21:46,583
He's a dentist,
does lot of crown work, so...

456
00:21:46,916 --> 00:21:48,000
I'm not interested.

457
00:21:48,416 --> 00:21:50,875
Oh, that's a shame. We need both of you.

458
00:21:53,208 --> 00:21:54,041
Both?

459
00:21:54,125 --> 00:21:55,041
[together] Both.

460
00:21:56,125 --> 00:21:58,291
- Are you guys talking about me too?
- [both] No.

461
00:21:58,375 --> 00:22:00,208
Oh, well, you said both, so that's...

462
00:22:00,291 --> 00:22:02,500
- Time's up. Are you in or dead?
- OK!

463
00:22:02,583 --> 00:22:06,666
No! No. That is not the saying.
It's not "in or dead," it's "in or out."

464
00:22:06,750 --> 00:22:07,583
It's "in or out."

465
00:22:07,666 --> 00:22:10,958
I would like to speak for my wife,
and we're gonna respectfully say

466
00:22:11,375 --> 00:22:12,833
w-w-we are out.

467
00:22:12,916 --> 00:22:14,541
- [panting]
- I'm in.

468
00:22:17,166 --> 00:22:19,666
- [sighs]
- [Ron] W-What? Honey…

469
00:22:20,833 --> 00:22:22,458
- Honey, wh...
- Good night.

470
00:22:22,666 --> 00:22:24,000
- [Ron] Margot!
- [gasps]

471
00:22:24,083 --> 00:22:26,541
- Relax! It's just a mild sedative.
- [Ron] Margot.

472
00:22:26,625 --> 00:22:28,666
Your wife is a dangerous woman, Mr. Finch.

473
00:22:28,750 --> 00:22:30,333
At least, she used to be.

474
00:22:30,416 --> 00:22:31,666
- [chuckles]
- [Ron] Margot!

475
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:33,875
[woman] Stuff 'em in the car.
Let's get going.

476
00:22:36,208 --> 00:22:38,875
[panting]

477
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,125
Guys! Guys! Guys!

478
00:22:41,750 --> 00:22:43,625
Guys! Guys! Guys!

479
00:22:43,708 --> 00:22:45,708
Hey, you're gonna wake up my parents!

480
00:22:45,958 --> 00:22:48,375
No, they're gone!
Ninjas just stole your parents.

481
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,416
[panting]

482
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:56,375
S-See? I never lie.
I was telling the truth!

483
00:22:56,458 --> 00:22:58,666
- [panting]
- Oh, my God.

484
00:22:58,750 --> 00:23:01,458
- [shouts] Mom?
- [Mim] Why would they take your parents?

485
00:23:01,541 --> 00:23:04,000
No offense, your dad owns a bakery,
your mom's a housewife.

486
00:23:04,083 --> 00:23:06,916
- It's not thrilling.
- I don't think your mom's really your mom.

487
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:10,708
I think she was, like, the head ninja,
and she was a very dangerous woman,

488
00:23:10,791 --> 00:23:13,166
and they kept calling her... Mathilde.

489
00:23:13,958 --> 00:23:14,791
What?

490
00:23:14,958 --> 00:23:16,625
Mom has another name than "Mom"?

491
00:23:16,708 --> 00:23:19,291
No! Mom doesn't have another name, OK?
She's not a ninja.

492
00:23:19,375 --> 00:23:21,708
She won't go in the basement,
she's afraid of crickets.

493
00:23:21,791 --> 00:23:23,250
[car approaching]

494
00:23:23,708 --> 00:23:24,916
- They're back!
- Oh my God.

495
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,333
- Who's <i>they? </i>What?
- [Mim mumbles] Shh!

496
00:23:42,958 --> 00:23:44,791
[man] Oh my gosh.

497
00:23:48,791 --> 00:23:50,833
[door lock clanking]

498
00:23:53,916 --> 00:23:55,375
Hello?

499
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,958
Anybody here?

500
00:24:00,541 --> 00:24:02,458
Ooh, hey!

501
00:24:02,541 --> 00:24:05,166
Kevin! I'm not here to hurt you, buddy.

502
00:24:05,250 --> 00:24:07,958
I'm-I'm a friend of your mom's.
Remember me? Henry?

503
00:24:08,291 --> 00:24:09,166
Hmm?

504
00:24:10,750 --> 00:24:14,166
OK. That is… a really cool sword.

505
00:24:14,250 --> 00:24:16,041
Yeah. It's a pirate sword.

506
00:24:16,125 --> 00:24:17,000
Uh-huh.

507
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:20,458
- Don't make me use it!
- [Henry] Oh, OK. [laughs] Whoa.

508
00:24:21,208 --> 00:24:23,583
Kevin, you are really brave,

509
00:24:23,666 --> 00:24:26,916
but, I mean, we both know
that's not a real sword, right?

510
00:24:27,291 --> 00:24:28,500
- [yells]
- [Henry grunts]

511
00:24:28,958 --> 00:24:30,666
[girls screaming]

512
00:24:30,750 --> 00:24:32,208
- [Lewis] Hee-yah!
- [Henry] Ow!

513
00:24:36,458 --> 00:24:38,333
He looks way too fat to be a ninja.

514
00:24:38,958 --> 00:24:40,250
You know, I can hear you.

515
00:24:40,333 --> 00:24:43,041
These things keep your ears warm,
but don't keep the sound out.

516
00:24:43,791 --> 00:24:46,000
- Where are our parents?
- [Henry] OK, listen.

517
00:24:46,083 --> 00:24:49,125
Kids, this is gonna sound confusing

518
00:24:49,208 --> 00:24:50,875
and a little scary.

519
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:54,000
My name is Henry Gibbs
and I'm a U.S. Marshal.

520
00:24:54,083 --> 00:24:57,916
I work for the division of WITSEC.
You might know that as Witness Protection.

521
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,916
About 15 years ago,
your mom entered the program.

522
00:25:02,541 --> 00:25:03,583
[Kevin] Wait.

523
00:25:03,666 --> 00:25:06,541
You mean to tell me
our mom's in witness protection?

524
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:10,041
- Like what they do with mob guys?
- I'm not allowed to get involved

525
00:25:10,125 --> 00:25:13,291
- with criminal activity.
- Kids, look, a long time ago,

526
00:25:13,375 --> 00:25:17,041
your mom got into some bad things
with some very dangerous people:

527
00:25:17,125 --> 00:25:18,541
the Pescatrici Syndicate.

528
00:25:18,958 --> 00:25:20,166
They were going to jail,

529
00:25:20,250 --> 00:25:23,208
and we convinced them to rat out
a very big crime boss.

530
00:25:23,291 --> 00:25:25,708
After that,
we had to get them new identities.

531
00:25:25,791 --> 00:25:27,666
It was my job to protect your mom.

532
00:25:28,166 --> 00:25:31,875
Our mom had a whole different life?
What's her real name?

533
00:25:31,958 --> 00:25:34,041
Well, I mean, that's classified informa...

534
00:25:34,125 --> 00:25:39,958
Mathilde Tremblay.
Born November 7th, 1976, Ontario, Canada.

535
00:25:40,791 --> 00:25:42,875
- [Clancy scoffs]
- We're Canadian?

536
00:25:42,958 --> 00:25:45,333
Wait, is that my phone?
How did you get my passcode?

537
00:25:45,833 --> 00:25:47,916
What? The first four digits
of your badge number?

538
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,916
- Yeah, that was tough to crack.
- OK. Don't like her.

539
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,083
Alright, listen.

540
00:25:52,166 --> 00:25:56,375
A video of Kevin dancing,
with his mom in it, got on the internet.

541
00:25:56,458 --> 00:25:58,708
It went viral.
It got, like, a million hits.

542
00:25:58,791 --> 00:26:01,166
The bad guys must have seen it
and tracked her down.

543
00:26:01,250 --> 00:26:02,416
A video of me...

544
00:26:03,583 --> 00:26:06,541
Oh, no. Um, that...
No, that didn't happen.

545
00:26:06,625 --> 00:26:10,333
- [Clancy] Nice job, Kevin.
- Fiancé: Leo Beauchamp.

546
00:26:10,416 --> 00:26:13,583
Born May 11th, 1974.

547
00:26:13,708 --> 00:26:16,916
- Whoa, check out this hottie.
- What? She had a fiancé?

548
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,416
- [Kevin] He is pretty cute.
- [Clancy] He's a musician?

549
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:22,875
- How long ago were they engaged?
- This was so long ago.

550
00:26:22,958 --> 00:26:25,250
It's before you guys were even born.

551
00:26:25,333 --> 00:26:29,708
Kids, your mom is a completely
different person than what she was.

552
00:26:29,791 --> 00:26:33,625
Tss! Yeah, no kidding.
She was some Canadian named Mathilde!

553
00:26:33,708 --> 00:26:35,208
What bad things did she do?

554
00:26:35,791 --> 00:26:36,750
[Henry sighs]

555
00:26:36,833 --> 00:26:39,708
She stole things. Very expensive things.

556
00:26:39,791 --> 00:26:43,958
I knew it! She always takes
the free samples at the grocery store.

557
00:26:44,041 --> 00:26:47,416
Not just one.
I'm talking entire handfuls, OK?

558
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:50,750
They said they were "getting the band
back together." She said she was in.

559
00:26:50,833 --> 00:26:53,666
[Henry] Uh, no, no. Hey, hey, stop it.

560
00:26:53,750 --> 00:26:55,666
We're jumping to conclusions.

561
00:26:55,750 --> 00:26:56,583
Y-Your mom...

562
00:26:56,666 --> 00:26:59,500
Mom? Whose mom? Is she even our real mom?

563
00:26:59,583 --> 00:27:01,000
Is anything real?

564
00:27:01,083 --> 00:27:03,875
- My whole life has been a lie!
- Oh, Kevin…

565
00:27:03,958 --> 00:27:05,791
Is that even my real name?

566
00:27:05,875 --> 00:27:07,541
Of course it's your real name.

567
00:27:07,625 --> 00:27:11,416
[Kevin] I hate hockey and Canadian bacon.
It's just ham.

568
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:14,000
I said some really,
really mean stuff to her today.

569
00:27:14,416 --> 00:27:15,541
I called her pathetic.

570
00:27:15,625 --> 00:27:18,458
- [Kevin] ...video off the internet?
- [Henry] Yeah, it was adorable.

571
00:27:18,541 --> 00:27:20,208
[Kevin] No, that didn't happen.

572
00:27:20,291 --> 00:27:23,416
Wait. This is Mom's necklace.
She wears this every day.

573
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:25,583
- She never takes it off.
- Yea, she never does.

574
00:27:25,666 --> 00:27:26,750
Whoa, look at this.

575
00:27:26,833 --> 00:27:28,625
Ooh, she left a message!

576
00:27:28,708 --> 00:27:31,375
- [Clancy] What?
- [Mim] Yes, what is this? Uh, Ang...

577
00:27:31,458 --> 00:27:33,208
- Am... Anger...
- [Clancy] Ak... An...

578
00:27:33,291 --> 00:27:34,875
Oh, Angus! Angus!

579
00:27:34,958 --> 00:27:36,041
Who's Angus?

580
00:27:36,125 --> 00:27:37,125
Who's Angus?

581
00:27:37,791 --> 00:27:39,500
- Your dog. Oh my God.
- Yes. OK.

582
00:27:42,791 --> 00:27:44,125
Hey, Angus.

583
00:27:44,833 --> 00:27:45,666
Angus!

584
00:27:46,708 --> 00:27:48,541
[shouts] What do you need to tell us?

585
00:27:48,625 --> 00:27:51,250
- [dog breathing softly]
- Hello? Anybody home?

586
00:27:52,041 --> 00:27:53,250
Ah, it's no use.

587
00:27:53,875 --> 00:27:56,291
- What's wrong with him?
- I don't know. He's out cold.

588
00:27:56,375 --> 00:27:57,583
Dude, he's drugged.

589
00:27:57,666 --> 00:28:00,666
Take off his collar
so he's more comfortable. Poor baby.

590
00:28:04,166 --> 00:28:05,000
Wait.

591
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:08,791
One, nine, nine, Fayette Street.

592
00:28:08,875 --> 00:28:10,416
That's not our address.

593
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,000
Wait a second.

594
00:28:13,833 --> 00:28:16,916
Look! The symbols match.
That has to mean something, right?

595
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,041
What would that mean?
Who's at that address?

596
00:28:19,125 --> 00:28:21,875
I don't know. Uh, maybe Mom's trying
to tell us something?

597
00:28:21,958 --> 00:28:23,916
- We should go!
- Children, listen.

598
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,958
- Whatever you're trying to do right now...
- No!

599
00:28:27,250 --> 00:28:29,625
Guys, whatever's at this address
could help us find them.

600
00:28:30,125 --> 00:28:31,500
We can fix this.

601
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:35,166
- Let's go get Mom and Dad back.
- [Henry] Uh, no way!

602
00:28:35,250 --> 00:28:36,666
Those are dangerous people.

603
00:28:36,750 --> 00:28:38,625
You need to leave this to the adults

604
00:28:38,708 --> 00:28:41,375
and trained professionals such as myself.

605
00:28:41,458 --> 00:28:44,166
Baby, you're tied to a chair
with Christmas lights.

606
00:28:44,250 --> 00:28:47,958
Hey! You kids can't just leave me here.
[sighs] Oh... Oh, see?

607
00:28:48,541 --> 00:28:51,250
You know what? I may have misjudged you.

608
00:28:51,333 --> 00:28:54,166
- If you could just ke...
- [Christmas jingle playing]

609
00:28:56,958 --> 00:28:59,250
Oh, she is the worst.

610
00:29:01,833 --> 00:29:03,250
- [door closes]
- [sighs]

611
00:29:05,958 --> 00:29:07,833
- [driver] Miriam?
- Yeah, that's me.

612
00:29:10,583 --> 00:29:11,458
It's night.

613
00:29:11,541 --> 00:29:13,291
- Your parents know you're out?
- Yes!

614
00:29:13,375 --> 00:29:15,375
- Of course.
- They joined a gang of ninjas.

615
00:29:15,458 --> 00:29:16,875
- Shh!
- Is this weird?

616
00:29:16,958 --> 00:29:19,375
- Will I get in trouble?
- No, dude. Seriously?

617
00:29:19,458 --> 00:29:22,541
You're making it weird.
You want me to give you the one star?

618
00:29:22,625 --> 00:29:23,958
- I'll do it.
- She'll do it.

619
00:29:27,041 --> 00:29:28,041
[doors unlock]

620
00:29:34,250 --> 00:29:35,541
Lewis, come on, man.

621
00:29:35,625 --> 00:29:38,291
This is our chance
to be heroes in the real world.

622
00:29:38,375 --> 00:29:41,291
Not some imaginary world
everyone says we live in.

623
00:29:41,791 --> 00:29:43,666
Come on. Let's go save my parents.

624
00:29:46,750 --> 00:29:47,750
OK.

625
00:29:49,708 --> 00:29:52,250
- [Mim] Boys, let's go.
- [Kevin] Get in the car.

626
00:29:55,083 --> 00:29:55,916
Buckle up.

627
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,208
- [Baxter] Go.
- [Ron] OK. Alright.

628
00:30:00,125 --> 00:30:02,583
Witness protection.
I can't believe you didn't tell me.

629
00:30:02,666 --> 00:30:04,666
Honey, that's the point
of witness protection.

630
00:30:04,750 --> 00:30:06,333
- You can't tell anyone.
- So, what?

631
00:30:06,416 --> 00:30:10,416
You were loosely associated with bad guys
who were involved in criminal activity?

632
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,250
Sure, we'll go with that.

633
00:30:12,750 --> 00:30:14,583
So you're not really from Nebraska?

634
00:30:15,083 --> 00:30:17,083
- Yes.
- Yes, you're from Nebraska.

635
00:30:17,166 --> 00:30:18,875
OK, well, at least that's true.

636
00:30:18,958 --> 00:30:21,875
No. I mean, yes, I'm not from Nebraska.

637
00:30:21,958 --> 00:30:24,000
What about your Cornhuskers T-shirt?

638
00:30:24,083 --> 00:30:25,125
They gave it to me.

639
00:30:25,208 --> 00:30:28,208
- I'm sorry, I couldn't tell you.
- [Ron] Is our marriage a lie?

640
00:30:28,291 --> 00:30:29,625
No. I know this is traumatic.

641
00:30:29,708 --> 00:30:32,291
Yeah! We're being held at gunpoint!
We've been kidnapped!

642
00:30:32,375 --> 00:30:34,416
- Shut up before I kill you both.
- Shutting up.

643
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:35,375
[dog barks]

644
00:30:39,583 --> 00:30:40,541
[Margot] Angus?

645
00:30:41,791 --> 00:30:44,083
Angus! Hi, buddy.

646
00:30:44,166 --> 00:30:45,250
[dog barking]

647
00:30:45,333 --> 00:30:47,125
Oh, you got old.

648
00:30:48,333 --> 00:30:49,416
Who's there?

649
00:30:52,166 --> 00:30:53,083
Mathilde.

650
00:30:55,208 --> 00:30:56,583
- Leo.
- Who's that?

651
00:30:57,833 --> 00:30:59,875
- Her fiancé.
- Her <i>what?</i>

652
00:31:09,375 --> 00:31:10,500
Oh, that's great.

653
00:31:11,041 --> 00:31:12,250
That's… that's great.

654
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:13,875
[sighs]

655
00:31:14,958 --> 00:31:17,291
- What are you doing here?
- [softly] I don't...

656
00:31:19,041 --> 00:31:19,875
I'm sorry.

657
00:31:20,750 --> 00:31:21,625
For what?

658
00:31:22,250 --> 00:31:23,291
[woman] For this!

659
00:31:26,833 --> 00:31:27,708
[sighs]

660
00:31:29,041 --> 00:31:30,500
What is happening?

661
00:31:30,583 --> 00:31:32,500
[upbeat music playing]

662
00:31:32,583 --> 00:31:33,916
[driver] This is it, kids.

663
00:31:35,041 --> 00:31:37,166
[Clancy] Great. Creepy storage unit place.

664
00:31:37,250 --> 00:31:40,833
- [Mim] It's cute. It's great.
- [Clancy] This night keeps getting better.

665
00:31:40,916 --> 00:31:43,666
[Lewis] I'm not allowed
to break into private property.

666
00:31:43,750 --> 00:31:46,541
- [Clancy] Your choice, Lewis.
- [Mim] Nobody's allowed to trespass.

667
00:31:46,625 --> 00:31:47,625
[Kevin grunting]

668
00:31:47,708 --> 00:31:50,375
[sighs] Thanks, team.
We got this. Thanks, guys.

669
00:31:51,666 --> 00:31:52,666
Wait for me.

670
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,916
[Ron] OK, wait!
I wanna make sure I get this straight.

671
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,041
You got the same exact kind of dog,

672
00:32:01,125 --> 00:32:03,125
and then gave it the same exact name.

673
00:32:03,208 --> 00:32:05,458
Know what I wanted to name it?
Indiana Bones.

674
00:32:05,541 --> 00:32:08,250
But you insisted on Angus
and now I know why.

675
00:32:08,333 --> 00:32:11,583
I wasn't allowed to bring him
into the program and I missed him.

676
00:32:11,916 --> 00:32:15,291
There's a midnight gala tonight
in the Grand Concert Hall.

677
00:32:16,583 --> 00:32:18,625
The royal crown of Durámuran.

678
00:32:19,291 --> 00:32:21,833
The crown will be on the head
of the Queen of Moldana.

679
00:32:21,916 --> 00:32:24,875
- The King and the Queen...
- Sorry, don't mean to interrupt, ma'am.

680
00:32:25,458 --> 00:32:28,833
Honey, is there a second set of children
who look exactly like ours

681
00:32:28,916 --> 00:32:30,333
that I should know about?

682
00:32:30,416 --> 00:32:31,750
[Leo] Wait. You have kids?

683
00:32:33,541 --> 00:32:35,125
- Course you do.
- Yeah.

684
00:32:35,208 --> 00:32:37,125
[sighs] Oh, man. [smacks lips]

685
00:32:37,750 --> 00:32:40,625
I mean, when we both
went into the program, I just…

686
00:32:40,708 --> 00:32:43,750
I guess I just never found…
the right person.

687
00:32:43,833 --> 00:32:47,125
[Ron laughing]

688
00:32:47,208 --> 00:32:49,333
You know what else you didn't find, Leo?

689
00:32:49,416 --> 00:32:52,333
Your sleeves.
You couldn't find your sleeves.

690
00:32:52,416 --> 00:32:54,583
- It's cold out! What's he trying to prove?
- Ron!

691
00:32:54,666 --> 00:32:56,958
You know what?
The answer is no. We won't do it.

692
00:32:57,041 --> 00:32:59,041
- Then, we have no use for you.
- [gun cocks]

693
00:32:59,125 --> 00:33:01,250
- [Ron] Nah.
- No, no. Wait, wait.

694
00:33:01,333 --> 00:33:02,458
If we steal this,

695
00:33:02,541 --> 00:33:03,708
that's it.

696
00:33:03,791 --> 00:33:05,208
We're done. We're even.

697
00:33:06,125 --> 00:33:07,750
You leave my family alone.

698
00:33:08,125 --> 00:33:11,708
We pull this off,
we never have to work again.

699
00:33:11,791 --> 00:33:14,500
We'll disappear.
Those kids will be safe and sound.

700
00:33:14,583 --> 00:33:16,833
No... it's too dangerous.

701
00:33:16,916 --> 00:33:18,041
God, he's so big!

702
00:33:18,125 --> 00:33:21,000
You heard what they said.
If we commit another crime in the program,

703
00:33:21,083 --> 00:33:22,708
we go to jail for a long time.

704
00:33:23,541 --> 00:33:25,666
There's no second chance for us this time.

705
00:33:26,833 --> 00:33:28,541
Well then, we just won't get caught.

706
00:33:30,541 --> 00:33:32,666
[Kevin] Oh, this is unit seven.

707
00:33:32,750 --> 00:33:36,041
[sighs] But it's locked. Of course.

708
00:33:36,458 --> 00:33:38,166
And we don't have the combination.

709
00:33:38,250 --> 00:33:41,333
I mean... [sighs]
I use my birthday for my locker.

710
00:33:41,416 --> 00:33:42,625
Try my birthday.

711
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,416
My birthday is March 20th.

712
00:33:47,041 --> 00:33:50,375
[lock clicking]

713
00:33:50,791 --> 00:33:51,791
[lock unlocks]

714
00:33:54,333 --> 00:33:55,250
My birthday.

715
00:33:55,541 --> 00:33:56,375
Huh!

716
00:34:02,833 --> 00:34:03,875
It's dark in there.

717
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:15,333

[light switch clicks]

719
00:34:27,916 --> 00:34:29,625
This is a bit of a letdown.

720
00:34:30,541 --> 00:34:32,416
It's just Nana and Grampy's old crap.

721
00:34:33,416 --> 00:34:34,916
There's nothing cool here.

722
00:34:35,875 --> 00:34:38,958
[Mim] I don't know, babe.
There's just a lot of chairs in here.

723
00:34:39,041 --> 00:34:40,125
[Kevin sighs]

724
00:34:40,958 --> 00:34:42,583
[Clancy] We won't find anything.

725
00:34:42,666 --> 00:34:45,291
[Mim] There's at least four chairs
in this corner.

726
00:34:45,791 --> 00:34:48,833
I'm just really put off
by the amount of chairs in front of us.

729
00:34:53,875 --> 00:34:55,375
Kevin, what did you do?

730
00:34:55,791 --> 00:34:57,750
Nothing! That was already there.

731
00:34:58,125 --> 00:35:00,583

00:35:17,666 --> 00:35:18,541
[Mim] Um...

736
00:35:20,041 --> 00:35:21,041
What?

737
00:35:22,666 --> 00:35:23,916
- Kevin?
- Kevin?

738

- Kev?
- [mechanism clanking]

739
00:35:27,625 --> 00:35:28,458
Kevin?

740
00:35:31,166 --> 00:35:32,291
Oh, yeah.

741
00:35:33,041 --> 00:35:36,750
I don't think your mom was just
a regular smash-and-grab thief.

742
00:35:37,166 --> 00:35:40,333
- [softly] Yeah.
- I saw this bad boy on <i>Forza Horizon!</i>

743
00:35:40,416 --> 00:35:42,458
- What?
- [Kevin] Like the rarest car ever!

744
00:35:42,541 --> 00:35:44,916
Can't believe Nana and Grampy
have one of these!

745

[squeaking]

746
00:35:47,916 --> 00:35:48,750
Whoa!

747
00:35:48,833 --> 00:35:51,583
Dude there's, like,
a lot of handcuffs in here.

748
00:35:52,583 --> 00:35:54,916
OK, OK. [gasps]

749
00:35:55,291 --> 00:35:57,875
Your mom is getting cooler by,
like, the second.

750
00:35:59,208 --> 00:36:00,250
[Clancy] Is this hers?

751
00:36:01,291 --> 00:36:04,375
Whoa! Look at this!
Look, it's a lollipop knife!

752
00:36:04,791 --> 00:36:06,208
Whoa!

753
00:36:06,291 --> 00:36:07,625
[Clancy] What do we think?

754
00:36:08,041 --> 00:36:09,458
Hmm?

755
00:36:10,041 --> 00:36:12,458
- You need to take off that jacket.
- [sighs]

756
00:36:12,541 --> 00:36:15,708
- Because I'm falling in love with you.
- [laughs]

757
00:36:15,791 --> 00:36:17,083
What's this do?

758
00:36:18,291 --> 00:36:20,375
- Let's not touch that!
- [Lewis] Um, yeah.

759
00:36:20,458 --> 00:36:22,291
- There's stuff in the pockets.
- What?

760
00:36:24,208 --> 00:36:27,083
- [Mim gasps]
- [Clancy] Oh, my God! Is that my mom?

761
00:36:27,166 --> 00:36:29,875
- [Mim] Oh!
- She won't even let me dye my hair.

762
00:36:30,416 --> 00:36:31,291
What is...?

763
00:36:34,291 --> 00:36:36,166
- Who's William?
- [Clancy] I don't know.

764
00:36:36,250 --> 00:36:38,541
It's missing the last digit
of his phone number.

765
00:36:39,416 --> 00:36:41,791
There's an address.
Maybe we can find him there.

766
00:36:41,875 --> 00:36:43,750
It's all the way in the city, though.

767
00:36:43,958 --> 00:36:46,416
How are we gonna get there?
None of us have a license.

768
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:49,416
Honestly, even if we did,
Cape traffic on Friday is a nightmare.

769
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:53,000
- That's, like, three hours.
- But it's only 30 nautical miles.

Junior Marine Biologist Camp.

771
00:36:59,250 --> 00:37:01,625
Thirty miles. We could do that, right?

772
00:37:01,708 --> 00:37:03,333
Oh, but we need a boat.

773
00:37:04,166 --> 00:37:05,958
I know someone who has a boat.

774
00:37:07,125 --> 00:37:08,041
- No.
- Yeah.

775
00:37:08,125 --> 00:37:09,250
- No.
- Yes.

776
00:37:09,333 --> 00:37:10,166
- Mim!
- Clancy!

777
00:37:10,250 --> 00:37:12,166
- Are you insane?
- Are <i>you </i>insane?

778
00:37:12,250 --> 00:37:13,125
We're doing this.

779
00:37:13,208 --> 00:37:16,166
- Mim, you know I can't do this.
- We have to! You have to do this!

780
00:37:16,250 --> 00:37:18,208
- You're crazy!
- [in Spanish] Shut up!

[in English] It's to save your parents.

782
00:37:22,041 --> 00:37:23,583
And maybe to get a boyfriend.

783

I'm not doing this.

784
00:37:31,625 --> 00:37:32,750

785
00:37:32,833 --> 00:37:34,541
Yeah, we're just gettin' some gear.

786
00:37:34,625 --> 00:37:36,875
OK, how about this?

787
00:37:37,708 --> 00:37:41,125
- [Lewis] It's just a pen.
- Ah, you're right. I'll go put it back.

788
00:37:44,625 --> 00:37:47,291
A pen that shoots lasers!

789

Score!

790
00:37:48,458 --> 00:37:51,458
Put that thing down, OK?
Quit touching stuff! Let's go!

791
00:37:51,541 --> 00:37:53,250
[Lewis] We might need this.

792
00:37:53,333 --> 00:37:57,125
How you gonna get us to Boston?
You have your permit, not your license.

793
00:37:57,208 --> 00:38:00,958
You've driven dad's van twice,
and almost killed us twice.

794
00:38:01,041 --> 00:38:03,041
OK, I did not almost kill us…

795
00:38:03,750 --> 00:38:05,000
The second time.

796
00:38:05,083 --> 00:38:07,791
It's fine! I got this. I'm a great driver.

Please take it off.

00:39:36,458 --> 00:39:37,666
Cool party. [laughs]

835
00:39:37,750 --> 00:39:38,583
Thanks.

836
00:39:41,375 --> 00:39:42,958
OK, we need to get to Boston.

837
00:39:43,750 --> 00:39:45,458
- What?
- [Emma] Well, well, well.

838
00:39:45,541 --> 00:39:47,208
If it isn't Clancy Finch.

839
00:39:47,291 --> 00:39:49,875
Didn't think you had it in you
to show up to a seniors' party.

840
00:39:49,958 --> 00:39:52,750
I just thought, once a band nerd,
always a band nerd.

841
00:39:52,833 --> 00:39:55,041
- Hey, Mim, nice outfit.
- Really? Yours is terrible.

842
00:39:55,416 --> 00:39:57,375
- Mm... Thanks.
- [Kevin] Hey! What's up?

843
00:39:57,458 --> 00:39:59,333
[girl] Hey, little man, what's up?

844
00:39:59,416 --> 00:40:01,958
My God. Did you bring
your little brother to the party?

845
00:40:02,041 --> 00:40:03,791
- [Kevin] Call me.
- [Emma] So weird.

846
00:40:03,875 --> 00:40:05,791
How'd you get here?
Your mom drop you off?

847
00:40:06,166 --> 00:40:08,125
No, she got kidnapped by ninjas.

848
00:40:08,208 --> 00:40:10,375
And she drove us here in a super cool car.

849
00:40:10,458 --> 00:40:14,166
[chuckles] Wait. Aren't you
the dancing dork from the bathroom?

850
00:40:14,250 --> 00:40:15,208
[giggling]

851
00:40:15,291 --> 00:40:17,041
[giggles] Yeah, he's so weird.

852
00:40:17,458 --> 00:40:18,291
Alright.

853
00:40:19,333 --> 00:40:23,166
OK. Hi. Hello. Yeah, we need to get
across the bay to the city. It's urgent.

854
00:40:23,250 --> 00:40:25,500
You can't just drive
across the bay at night.

855
00:40:25,875 --> 00:40:29,458
Yuh-huh. Me and my brothers go across
all the time to go night fishing.

856
00:40:29,541 --> 00:40:31,916
- It's totally cool.
- Yeah, we could take you. Right, Joey?

857
00:40:32,333 --> 00:40:35,291
Whatever then. Have fun
with band nerd and the freak fest.

858
00:40:35,666 --> 00:40:36,750
Love you, too.

859
00:40:37,458 --> 00:40:39,375
- We're gonna prep the boat now.
- [Clancy] OK.

860
00:40:39,875 --> 00:40:41,250
You go "prep the boat."

861
00:40:41,750 --> 00:40:42,583
[giggles]

862
00:40:42,666 --> 00:40:45,375
Uh, do you guys have
proper flotation safety devices?

863
00:40:45,458 --> 00:40:47,208
- [Travis] Definitely not.
- [Joey] No.

864
00:40:48,583 --> 00:40:52,750
Alright, here's what's gonna happen.
Baxter will run intel. I'm interference.

865
00:40:52,833 --> 00:40:56,250
You two, Count and Countess Van Der Holt
of Belgium…

866
00:40:57,250 --> 00:40:58,458
Secure the crown.

867
00:40:59,333 --> 00:41:02,541
Escape routes are here on the east side
through the ladies' room vents.

868
00:41:02,625 --> 00:41:05,166
Get the Queen there
and the crown's an easy grab.

869
00:41:05,250 --> 00:41:06,666
You got rid of your tattoo?

870
00:41:08,166 --> 00:41:11,041
A tattoo? You said that was a birthmark.

871
00:41:14,500 --> 00:41:16,291
You both had the same tattoo?

872
00:41:16,666 --> 00:41:18,333
- Um...
- [woman] Get ready.

873
00:41:18,416 --> 00:41:19,416
Wheels up in ten.

874
00:41:20,333 --> 00:41:23,458
- Honey, you said that was a birthmark.
- I didn't know what to tell you.

875
00:41:23,541 --> 00:41:24,916
- I'm sorry.
- The...

876
00:41:25,375 --> 00:41:27,750
- You thinking the Vermeer in Dubai?
- [Margot] Exactly.

877
00:41:27,833 --> 00:41:30,208
Make the Queen sick,
corner her in the bathroom.

878
00:41:30,291 --> 00:41:31,583
[Ron] Dubai?

879
00:41:31,666 --> 00:41:33,625
You... you went to Dubai?

880
00:41:33,708 --> 00:41:34,583
OK, that's it!

881
00:41:35,916 --> 00:41:38,833
I wanna know what the both of you
are involved in, right now!

882
00:41:39,208 --> 00:41:40,333
- Rob…
- Ron.

883
00:41:40,833 --> 00:41:41,666
OK.

884
00:41:41,750 --> 00:41:44,625
Look, we were just a couple
of dumb broke kids

885
00:41:44,708 --> 00:41:47,875
looking for a bigger life and...
I just wanted it the easy way.

886
00:41:48,458 --> 00:41:50,666
I got us involved
with Jean-Paul Deauxville.

887
00:41:50,750 --> 00:41:52,208
Jean-Paul... [garbling].

888
00:41:52,458 --> 00:41:55,125
- Jean-Paul Deauxville.
- Jean-Paul... [garbling].

889
00:41:55,583 --> 00:41:57,583
- Deauxville.
- Jean-Paul... [garbling].

890
00:41:57,708 --> 00:41:59,416
- OK.
- I'm saying what you're saying.

891
00:41:59,500 --> 00:42:00,375
Yeah, close enough.

892
00:42:00,458 --> 00:42:04,750
He's a very dangerous, very connected man.
Big-time smuggler and trafficker.

893
00:42:05,541 --> 00:42:06,791
You guys are smugglers?

894
00:42:07,250 --> 00:42:09,041
Of... drugs?

895
00:42:09,125 --> 00:42:11,833
[Margot] No, honey, don't worry.
Nothing like that.

896
00:42:11,916 --> 00:42:14,666
I was a thief of expensive things.

897
00:42:14,750 --> 00:42:16,583
Very expensive things.

898
00:42:17,041 --> 00:42:19,375
Priceless artifacts
we'd sell on the black market.

899
00:42:19,458 --> 00:42:21,791
Mathilde… was the best of the best.

900
00:42:22,375 --> 00:42:25,125
[Margot chuckles] OK, that's not...
I was not the best.

901
00:42:25,208 --> 00:42:29,083
You stole the Sultan of Brunei's
favorite polo pony during the polo match.

902
00:42:29,166 --> 00:42:31,625
[Margot chuckles]
OK. Well, yeah, that… that <i>was </i>good.

903
00:42:31,708 --> 00:42:33,791
- [Leo laughing]
- [Margot laughing]

904
00:42:33,875 --> 00:42:37,041
[Ron laughing]

905
00:42:39,583 --> 00:42:41,291
What a fun walk down memory lane,

906
00:42:41,375 --> 00:42:44,250
when you both were
big fat lying smugglers.

907
00:42:44,333 --> 00:42:46,875
- Y-y-you're right, Ross.
- My name is Ron!

908
00:42:47,291 --> 00:42:49,458
The point is,
it was dangerous and illegal.

909
00:42:49,541 --> 00:42:51,166
- It was all my fault.
- Ron.

910
00:42:51,250 --> 00:42:53,541
- [Margot] We were wrong.
- [Leo] You opened my eyes.

911
00:42:53,625 --> 00:42:57,333
She convinced me that we had to get out.
Witness Protection was the only option.

912
00:42:57,416 --> 00:43:01,166
[Margot] Our testimonies put Jean-Paul
behind bars, where he belongs.

913
00:43:01,708 --> 00:43:03,166
We did the right thing.

914
00:43:05,500 --> 00:43:06,458
[sighs]

915
00:43:07,583 --> 00:43:08,416
Wow.

916
00:43:09,541 --> 00:43:10,958
But it cost me everything.

917
00:43:11,041 --> 00:43:12,041
[sighs]

918
00:43:14,125 --> 00:43:15,375
I'm coming with you.

919
00:43:16,291 --> 00:43:17,458
- What?
- I'm going with you.

920
00:43:17,541 --> 00:43:20,541
- I'm not gonna leave you...
- No! Absolutely not. It's too dangerous.

921
00:43:20,625 --> 00:43:22,458
- No, he could be useful.
- Thank you.

922
00:43:22,541 --> 00:43:23,750
- As a diversion.
- Oh!

923
00:43:23,833 --> 00:43:26,250
Especially if another situation
like Romania happens.

924
00:43:26,333 --> 00:43:28,791
- Romania? When did you go to Romania?
- Honey, no...

925
00:43:28,875 --> 00:43:30,458
Listen. Hear that?

926
00:43:30,541 --> 00:43:33,000
It's a helo. We're taking a helo.
You don't have Dramamine.

927
00:43:33,083 --> 00:43:36,208
- What about your motion sickness?
- I don't get motion sickness. This is...

928
00:43:36,291 --> 00:43:37,708
[Margot] Yes, you do.

929
00:43:37,791 --> 00:43:40,916
Remember, in the cabin,
throwing up for four days on the cruise?

930
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,916
For the last time, that was
the King Neptune's potato salad.

931
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:45,916
You don't make
a mayonnaise-based side dish,

932
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,750
leave it out for six hours
and expect no repercussions.

933
00:43:53,500 --> 00:43:57,333
Guys, I'm really at home
on the open water! Loving this.

934
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,708
- Is he OK?
- He gets seasick like his dad.

935
00:44:03,875 --> 00:44:05,166
[man] <i>U.S. Coast Guard.</i>

936
00:44:05,250 --> 00:44:08,666
<i>Cut your engine and prepare
for immediate boarding of your vessel.</i>

- [siren blaring]

938
00:44:11,666 --> 00:44:13,375
[Clancy] Uh, Travis, what's happening?

939
00:44:13,458 --> 00:44:17,708
I don't exactly have my license, so, uh…
we might get arrested now.

940
00:44:17,791 --> 00:44:20,166
- What?
- What do you mean we might get arrested?

941
00:44:20,250 --> 00:44:22,458
We can't get arrested!
We have to find my mom!

942
00:44:22,541 --> 00:44:24,708
We can stall them,
say we were messing around, got lost.

943
00:44:24,791 --> 00:44:25,625
You guys can swim.

944
00:44:25,708 --> 00:44:27,250
- I mean…
- No way!

945
00:44:27,333 --> 00:44:28,958
I-I we don't have a choice, guys!

946
00:44:29,041 --> 00:44:31,750
It's dark so they won't see you,
but you gotta hurry.

947
00:44:31,833 --> 00:44:32,666
OK.

948
00:44:32,750 --> 00:44:35,166
Are there things in there
that can, like, eat us?

949
00:44:35,250 --> 00:44:36,958
- No.
- Come on, you guys gotta go.

950
00:44:37,041 --> 00:44:38,416
Clancy, what are you doing?

951
00:44:38,500 --> 00:44:40,875
- [Clancy] We have to do this, guys.
- No! Don't!

952
00:44:42,166 --> 00:44:43,375
Wow.

953
00:44:43,458 --> 00:44:45,041
- Guys, come on.
- [Lewis screams]

954
00:44:45,125 --> 00:44:47,416
- [Clancy] Hurry! Jump!
- I don't think I can, Kev.

955
00:44:47,833 --> 00:44:49,708
We can do this, together.

956
00:44:50,041 --> 00:44:51,666
- [Clancy] Hurry! Jump!
- It'll be fine.

957
00:44:51,750 --> 00:44:54,708
- [man] <i>This is the U.S. Coast Guard.</i>
- Come on, guys. Hurry up!

958
00:44:54,791 --> 00:44:57,166
- [siren blaring]
- [Kevin] You got this, Mim.

959
00:44:57,666 --> 00:44:59,291
One. Two…

960
00:44:59,708 --> 00:45:01,083
[whimpers]

961
00:45:01,291 --> 00:45:02,958

<i>♪ Buh, buh, buh... ♪</i>

966
00:45:11,875 --> 00:45:13,375
I never understood that.

967
00:45:13,458 --> 00:45:17,291
They come, sing carols, demand cookies,
they don't leave until they get 'em.

968
00:45:17,375 --> 00:45:20,250
Where's the Christmas spirit in that?
It's just plain extortion.

969
00:45:20,333 --> 00:45:22,458
- Do you know what I mean?
- [growls]

970
00:45:23,166 --> 00:45:26,583
OK, calm down.
We are gonna be friends.

971
00:45:26,666 --> 00:45:28,291
Right? We're fr...

972
00:45:28,375 --> 00:45:29,416
Oh, look.

973
00:45:29,500 --> 00:45:31,333
Ha! Cupcakes, huh?

974
00:45:31,416 --> 00:45:34,041
You want cupcakes?
Let's get some cupcakes.

975
00:45:34,125 --> 00:45:35,916
Get that... [grunts]

976
00:45:36,250 --> 00:45:38,208
- No!
- [dog barks]

977
00:45:38,291 --> 00:45:39,916
There will be a receiving line

978
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:41,958
for the King and Queen
in the grand ballroom.

979
00:45:42,500 --> 00:45:46,000
Leo, you install the poison strip
on Mathilde's right palm.

980
00:45:46,125 --> 00:45:49,708
Mathilde, once you shake the Queen's hand
and transfer the poison to her,

981
00:45:49,791 --> 00:45:52,041
the oils will absorb into her skin.

982
00:45:52,416 --> 00:45:55,458
You'll have approximately three minutes
before she gets sick.

983
00:45:55,541 --> 00:45:58,833
She won't die,
but she'll feel pretty awful for a while.

984
00:45:58,916 --> 00:46:03,166
Make sure nothing and no one
besides the Queen touches that right hand.

985
00:46:03,750 --> 00:46:05,500
Honey, are you sure you're alright?

986
00:46:05,583 --> 00:46:08,000
That helicopter ride
really did a number on you.

987
00:46:08,083 --> 00:46:09,291
Oh, no, I'm fine.

988
00:46:09,833 --> 00:46:12,708
- Are you sure you're OK?
- No, I'm-I'm totally fine. I'm...

[burps and blows]

993
00:46:23,500 --> 00:46:26,791
I just need bread to settle my stomach.
They're gonna have food at this thing?

994
00:46:26,875 --> 00:46:30,041
Uh, we're not really going to have time
to eat tonight, Roy.

995
00:46:30,125 --> 00:46:31,083
Yeah, Ron!

996
00:46:31,166 --> 00:46:32,541
It's Ron, Leo.

997
00:46:32,625 --> 00:46:35,625
And I'm not talking about
a sit-down dinner, Leo, OK?

998

00:55:43,500 --> 00:55:44,750
[Mim] Ugh, gross.

1165
00:55:45,166 --> 00:55:48,750
Ah! What is that? Satan?
No! I hate that. I hate that.

1166
00:55:48,833 --> 00:55:51,666
I hate this. I hate this tunnel.
What is this? Where are we?

1167
00:55:51,750 --> 00:55:54,500
- We should not be down here right now.
- [echoing rumble]

1168
00:55:54,583 --> 00:55:55,791
I mean, OK, look, I know,

1169
00:55:55,875 --> 00:56:00,333
this night's been insane, and we might not
make it out of this tunnel alive...

1170
00:56:00,416 --> 00:56:04,000
- Dude!
- But, I mean, you... you're Mim.

1171
00:56:04,583 --> 00:56:06,583
- Yes?
- You're not afraid of anything.

1172
00:56:07,125 --> 00:56:09,875
I mean, you're the bravest person I know.
[chuckles]

1173
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:12,166
I can't do half of the stuff that you do.

1174
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:18,125
- Clancy, look where we are right now.
- [chuckles]

1175
00:56:18,208 --> 00:56:23,000
We are walking through this dark,
disgusting tunnel at your request,

1176
00:56:23,500 --> 00:56:25,416
in the worst all-nighter ever,

1177
00:56:25,500 --> 00:56:28,291
and we're doing it
wearing the worst outfits on the planet.

1178
00:56:28,375 --> 00:56:31,750
What is this? I hate these shorts.
They come to such an unnatural length.

1179
00:56:31,833 --> 00:56:33,416
They stop mid-thigh.

1180
00:56:33,500 --> 00:56:36,291
- [laughs]
- You want brave? <i>Mid-thigh</i> is brave.

1181
00:56:36,791 --> 00:56:38,791
- [laughs]
- [Mim sighs]

1182
00:56:41,666 --> 00:56:44,125
- Give me a hug. What are you doing?
- [chuckles]

1183
00:56:44,791 --> 00:56:46,458
Aw, bring it in.

1184
00:56:50,208 --> 00:56:53,125
Just bring it out.
Just you two. Do your thang.

1185
00:56:56,333 --> 00:56:58,291
[splutters and retches]

1186
00:56:58,375 --> 00:56:59,291
Spiderweb!

1187
00:56:59,833 --> 00:57:01,125
[spluttering]

1188
00:57:01,208 --> 00:57:03,000
Oh, man. That was a gookie one.

1189
00:57:03,083 --> 00:57:05,708
Hate to see the monster
that made that thing.

1190
00:57:06,041 --> 00:57:07,458
Also, what is that?

1191
00:57:08,625 --> 00:57:11,875
[classical music playing]

1192
00:57:19,208 --> 00:57:20,958
How was your cavity search?

1193
00:57:23,041 --> 00:57:25,666
- Fun.
- Need to find a way to reach Henry.

1194
00:57:25,750 --> 00:57:28,500
No, it's too risky.
We just do what they want.

1195
00:57:28,583 --> 00:57:30,750
They'll disappear.
Your family will be safe.

1196
00:57:30,833 --> 00:57:34,041
Wait a second, who's Henry?
Henry, your best friend from college?

1197
00:57:34,125 --> 00:57:36,541
Let me guess.
You didn't go to college together?

1198
00:57:36,625 --> 00:57:39,083
Honey, he's the U.S. Marshal
assigned to my case.

1199
00:57:39,458 --> 00:57:41,875
He came over for Thanksgiving
when Kevin was a baby.

1200
00:57:41,958 --> 00:57:45,250
I baked him cranberry cornbread,
and he said he loved it.

1201
00:57:45,625 --> 00:57:49,000
It was a prescheduled home visit.
He did love the cornbread. We all did.

1202
00:57:49,083 --> 00:57:51,083
Well, why wouldn't he love the cornbread?

1203
00:57:53,375 --> 00:57:54,541
Your Excellencies,

1204
00:57:54,625 --> 00:57:57,041
my wife, the Countess Van Der Holt.

1205
00:57:59,166 --> 00:58:00,333
Very beautiful.

1206
00:58:00,458 --> 00:58:02,791
Yes, I'm a very lucky man.

1207
00:58:03,416 --> 00:58:05,500
I have never forgotten that.

1208
00:58:06,875 --> 00:58:07,916
[giggles]

1209
00:58:08,708 --> 00:58:12,750
OK, that's it. That's it. That's it!
Alright, we're going home.

1210
00:58:13,041 --> 00:58:14,750
- [gasps]
- [Ron] Oh! Oh!

1211
00:58:14,833 --> 00:58:16,833
Ah! I... Shh...

1212
00:58:18,125 --> 00:58:19,833
- [Margot gasps]
- [Ron muttering]

1213
00:58:20,333 --> 00:58:23,166
It touched my mouth.
What happens if it goes in my mouth?

1214
00:58:23,250 --> 00:58:26,916
Remember when Kevin drank a glow stick
and poison control said to give him milk.

1215
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:29,791
Can I get milk?
I need some milk! Can I get some milk?

1216
00:58:29,875 --> 00:58:32,541
Please excuse our assistant,
he has not been feeling well.

1217
00:58:32,625 --> 00:58:35,250
Food poisoning. [in French] Terrible.

1218
00:58:35,333 --> 00:58:38,500
- [Ron retching]
- [in English] Poisoning of the brain.

1219
00:58:39,458 --> 00:58:42,500
[spitting]

1220
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:46,416
- [Margot chuckles softly]
- [sighs] You know, you know what?

1221
00:58:47,041 --> 00:58:49,583
[chuckles] I think I'm OK.

1222
00:58:49,666 --> 00:58:51,416
- I'm alright, I'm OK.
- [they chuckle]

1223
00:58:51,500 --> 00:58:54,375
- You know what? I think… I overreacted.
- [Leo laughing]

1224
00:58:54,458 --> 00:58:55,666
[all laughing]

1225
00:58:55,750 --> 00:58:59,416
I've a strong immune system. I'm...
I overreact a bit. Nice to meet...

1226
00:59:00,333 --> 00:59:01,833
- [screams]
- [all gasp]

1227
00:59:01,916 --> 00:59:03,833
[onlookers gasp and scream]

1228
00:59:03,916 --> 00:59:05,541
Oh God... I think I'm OK.

1229
00:59:05,625 --> 00:59:07,416
- [retches]
- [security] Move back!

1230
00:59:09,250 --> 00:59:11,666
- [Margot] No... I... Wait...
- [Ron retching]

1231
00:59:11,750 --> 00:59:12,750
Oh!

1232
00:59:17,541 --> 00:59:20,291
[Mim] It just looks like
somebody's gross house.

1233
00:59:21,083 --> 00:59:23,541
What kind of freak
would actually live down here?

1234
00:59:24,458 --> 00:59:26,833
[woman] What kind of freaks
would go snooping around

1235
00:59:26,916 --> 00:59:28,291
when they didn't live here?

1236
00:59:28,750 --> 00:59:29,708
Good point.

1237
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:31,958
[they scream]

1238
00:59:32,833 --> 00:59:34,750
- No! Kevin, no!
- [woman] Start talking.

1239
00:59:34,833 --> 00:59:36,083
How did you find this place?

1240
00:59:36,166 --> 00:59:38,041
Our mom had a key!
Her name's Margot Finch!

1241
00:59:38,125 --> 00:59:40,083
Don't know her. Wrong answer.

1242
00:59:40,166 --> 00:59:41,875
- [Kevin yelps]
- No. Mathilde Tremblay!

1243
00:59:42,250 --> 00:59:43,666
He means Mathilde Tremblay.

1244
00:59:43,750 --> 00:59:45,083
I think she sent us here.

1245
00:59:45,833 --> 00:59:48,458
- How do you know Mathilde?
- [Kevin] She's our mom!

1246
00:59:48,541 --> 00:59:50,750
I think she's our mom.
Please don't hurt me.

1247
00:59:53,333 --> 00:59:55,166
[woman] Oh, yeah. You have her eyes.

1248
00:59:56,125 --> 00:59:57,458
So, you know her?

1249
00:59:57,791 --> 00:59:59,458
Yeah. We were like sisters.

1250
00:59:59,875 --> 01:00:02,583
Wow. Mom is not like I thought she was.

1251
01:00:03,333 --> 01:00:04,541
Oh. Right.

1252
01:00:05,625 --> 01:00:07,250
[sighs] I just got off a job.

1253
01:00:09,250 --> 01:00:10,375
Oh, where do you wo...

1254
01:00:10,833 --> 01:00:13,500
Oh, you... you stole that stuff.

1255
01:00:13,875 --> 01:00:17,250
Not like a big deal or anything.
We steal stuff all the time, right?

1256
01:00:17,333 --> 01:00:20,375
One time, I took two puddings at lunch.
I'm a real bad boy.

1257
01:00:20,458 --> 01:00:22,583
Kevin. Could you maybe just…

1258
01:00:23,625 --> 01:00:25,833
Tell us everything you know about my mom?

1259
01:00:25,916 --> 01:00:29,375
We grew up together. Pulling jobs.
Just kids' stuff, you know.

1260
01:00:29,458 --> 01:00:34,083
Scamming tourists, pickpocketing,
petty theft, your basic B and E.

1261
01:00:34,375 --> 01:00:38,208
Your idea of "kid stuff" is, like,
a lot different than ours.

1262
01:00:38,750 --> 01:00:42,500
Then we got mixed up in some bad stuff
with this guy named Jean-Paul.

1263
01:00:42,583 --> 01:00:45,208
J-Jean-Paul!
That's the guy Henry was talking about.

1264
01:00:45,291 --> 01:00:48,791
He's in prison now, but his people,
they came after my mom

1265
01:00:48,875 --> 01:00:52,375
and now they're planning this huge job,
and we're trying to find her.

1266
01:00:53,791 --> 01:00:54,625
Hm.

1267
01:00:56,166 --> 01:00:58,583
What makes you think she wants
to be found?

1268
01:00:59,416 --> 01:01:01,083
That necklace you're wearing.

1269
01:01:01,166 --> 01:01:03,416
She left us the same one
to get down here.

1270
01:01:03,500 --> 01:01:05,750
She left us tons of clues,
they all led here.

1271
01:01:05,833 --> 01:01:08,541
I think she wanted us to find you
so you could help us.

1272
01:01:13,458 --> 01:01:15,833
[woman] Your mom gave me something

1273
01:01:15,916 --> 01:01:17,958
before she went into witness protection.

1274
01:01:18,625 --> 01:01:21,875
She said I would know
if it ever came time to open it.

1275
01:01:22,625 --> 01:01:24,375
[suspenseful music plays]

1276
01:01:24,458 --> 01:01:25,708
[beeping]

1277
01:01:34,416 --> 01:01:36,708
- [Clancy] What is that?
- [Kevin] It's a pager.

1278
01:01:36,791 --> 01:01:38,750
My God, the olden days were tragic.

1279
01:01:38,833 --> 01:01:40,166
It's not a pager.

1280
01:01:40,250 --> 01:01:41,916
It's an old tracking device.

1281
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:43,250
[beeping]

1282
01:01:43,875 --> 01:01:45,250
[clanging]

1283
01:01:48,291 --> 01:01:49,916
[Ron] OK, I'm much better now.

1284
01:01:50,583 --> 01:01:52,041
Ahh... OK.

1285
01:01:52,625 --> 01:01:54,250
Yeah. That's all.

1286
01:01:54,333 --> 01:01:56,125
No more is comin'... [groans]

1287
01:01:57,291 --> 01:01:58,375
[grunts]

1288
01:01:59,250 --> 01:02:00,458
Yeah, I think I'm done.

1289
01:02:00,791 --> 01:02:03,416
Oof! Stay away from the seafood dip.

1290
01:02:04,125 --> 01:02:06,416
If I'm giving advice,
stay away from the seafood dip

1291
01:02:06,500 --> 01:02:08,208
because it's mayonnaise-based.

1292
01:02:08,291 --> 01:02:10,750
So, it's just not a good call.

1293
01:02:11,208 --> 01:02:12,958
So, just stay awa... [groans]

1294
01:02:13,041 --> 01:02:16,791
[murmuring and farting]

1295
01:02:17,875 --> 01:02:18,833
Ah!

1296
01:02:18,916 --> 01:02:21,250
[murmuring]

1297
01:02:21,333 --> 01:02:22,500
[farting]

1298
01:02:22,583 --> 01:02:25,875
Mm, OK. [laughs] I thought
it was coming out of both ends.

1299
01:02:26,958 --> 01:02:29,125
But it didn't… [sighs] It didn't.

1300
01:02:29,208 --> 01:02:30,916
We're good. Everybody, we're good.

1301
01:02:31,333 --> 01:02:33,208
What happened to your accent?

1302
01:02:33,291 --> 01:02:34,458
What happened to my...

1303
01:02:36,791 --> 01:02:39,125
[in bad French accent] How dare you, sir?

1304
01:02:39,833 --> 01:02:42,083
What? Who? Sir!

1305
01:02:42,166 --> 01:02:43,750
How dare you...

1306
01:02:44,208 --> 01:02:46,083
say something like that to me

1307
01:02:46,166 --> 01:02:48,708
- in front of the royal family?
- Save it.

1308
01:02:48,791 --> 01:02:51,166
- Do what?
- We put in a call to your consulate.

1309
01:02:51,250 --> 01:02:53,083
These... are fake.

1310
01:02:53,708 --> 01:02:56,750
There is no Count
or Countess Van Der Holt.

1311
01:02:57,666 --> 01:02:59,208
Well, what time did you call?

1312
01:02:59,291 --> 01:03:01,416
- Maybe it was lunch and they...
- Keep on them.

1313
01:03:01,500 --> 01:03:03,666
- I'm gonna go and get this sorted out.
- Yeah.

1314
01:03:03,750 --> 01:03:06,958
No, I'm saying, to get a croissant or…

1315
01:03:07,041 --> 01:03:09,750
[groaning and farting]

1316
01:03:09,833 --> 01:03:10,875
Both ends.

1317
01:03:13,083 --> 01:03:16,125
Alright, she must have had
a personal tracking device

1318
01:03:16,208 --> 01:03:18,750
implanted on her
in case something ever happened.

1319
01:03:21,208 --> 01:03:23,250
The Grand Concert Hall downtown.

1320
01:03:24,208 --> 01:03:27,000
Duran Duran! They said something about
the Crown of Duran Duran!

1321
01:03:27,500 --> 01:03:30,291
Durámuran? The Crown of Durámuran?

1322
01:03:30,416 --> 01:03:33,166
Oh, Lord... It's the Holy Grail.

1323
01:03:33,250 --> 01:03:35,208
They've been tracking that for years.

1324
01:03:35,291 --> 01:03:38,208
Your mom and I tried to steal it
from the Louvre. [sighs]

1325
01:03:38,291 --> 01:03:39,916
That's a good bedtime story.

1326
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:43,125
There's an event tonight
at the Grand Concert Hall. A big gala.

1327
01:03:43,208 --> 01:03:46,166
You know what? If the crown
is at that gala, so is your mom.

Eh, is it cool?
Or is it fiscally irresponsible?

1576
01:15:24,666 --> 01:15:27,291
You know, because rent downtown

What happened?

Oh, I don't know. It was a blur.

And I think I punched a couple of guys.

Uh, I mean...

1584
01:15:44,666 --> 01:15:47,583
I think that may have happened
when you fell down, awkwardly.

1585
01:15:47,666 --> 01:15:50,750
- Probably only a bruise.
- I think it's a bit more than a bruise.

1586
01:15:50,833 --> 01:15:54,666
- Uh, maybe like a funny bone.
- Nah, I don't think it's a funny bone.

so it's probably gonna affect my work.

Oh. Uh, you're a surgeon?

1592
01:16:05,208 --> 01:16:06,416
No, Leo. I am…

01:16:07,291 --> 01:16:10,791
A pastry chef, and I need my finger
strength and dexterity, so there you go.

- [Leo] Sure.

It's unbelievable.

Alright.

1600
01:16:24,750 --> 01:16:27,416
I activated emergency protocol.
We're all safe now.

1601
01:16:27,500 --> 01:16:29,625
Just have to wait for Henry to contact me.

1602
01:16:29,708 --> 01:16:31,291
How much is this worth, anyway?

1603
01:16:31,375 --> 01:16:33,958
I'd say somewhere
in the ballpark of 20 million.

1604
01:16:34,041 --> 01:16:35,625
[Kevin] Crazy! Twenty million?

1605
01:16:35,708 --> 01:16:37,541
We're giving it back.
It doesn't belong to us.

1606
01:16:37,625 --> 01:16:41,666
But, Mom, you used to steal stuff
all the time when you were younger.

1607
01:16:41,750 --> 01:16:43,166
- It was pretty cool.
- No.

1608
01:16:43,250 --> 01:16:45,541
Why can't we just say we lost it
or something?

1609
01:16:45,625 --> 01:16:48,875
Kev, listen to me. I was wrong.

1610
01:16:48,958 --> 01:16:50,750
I paid a hefty price for it.

1611
01:16:50,833 --> 01:16:53,166
And now,
it's put the people I love in danger.

1612
01:16:53,250 --> 01:16:56,125
OK? I don't ever want any of you guys
doing anything I did.

1613
01:16:56,583 --> 01:16:59,291
I made a lot of bad choices,
and hurt a lot of people.

1614
01:16:59,375 --> 01:17:01,916
And we really regret it. Don't we, Leo?

1615
01:17:03,416 --> 01:17:04,583
Well, eh…

1616
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:08,708
Of course, we do. We had to go into
witness protection to escape Jean-Paul.

1617
01:17:08,791 --> 01:17:11,833
Well, actually,
<i>you </i>went into witness protection.

1618
01:17:11,916 --> 01:17:14,250
I just couldn't get on board with that.

1619
01:17:14,333 --> 01:17:17,666
With Jean-Paul away in prison,
which I have you to thank for,

1620
01:17:18,416 --> 01:17:20,791
there was an opening
for a new Head of Operations.

1621
01:17:22,125 --> 01:17:23,125
[Clancy] Whoa.

1622
01:17:23,208 --> 01:17:26,041
- Mom, what's going on? Who is that?
- [Leo] You remember Elise?

1623
01:17:27,083 --> 01:17:29,583
She's with me. I sent her to get you.

1624
01:17:30,916 --> 01:17:34,041
Oh! OK, I knew it. [laughs]

1625
01:17:34,125 --> 01:17:36,541
I knew he was a bad guy.
Well, how about this?

1626
01:17:37,208 --> 01:17:38,083
Huh?

1627
01:17:38,541 --> 01:17:40,666
How about that on your Corinthian leather?

1628
01:17:41,416 --> 01:17:42,583
That's not cool, Ron.

1629
01:17:43,583 --> 01:17:44,500
You're not cool.

1630
01:17:45,500 --> 01:17:47,208
After we found you this time,

1631
01:17:47,291 --> 01:17:49,583
with the help of that little meatball
and his video...

1632
01:17:49,666 --> 01:17:52,333
Hey! Don't call my brother a meatball.

1633
01:17:52,416 --> 01:17:55,500
I knew the only way I was going to get you
to help me steal the crown

1634
01:17:55,583 --> 01:17:57,833
was if you thought
our lives were in danger.

1635
01:17:57,916 --> 01:17:59,000
Your moral compass,

1636
01:17:59,083 --> 01:18:01,750
always getting in the way
of us having a good time.

1637
01:18:01,833 --> 01:18:04,375
- So you never went into protection.
- [Leo] No.

1638
01:18:04,458 --> 01:18:06,541
- [scoffs]
- [Leo] I mean, come on, admit it.

1639
01:18:06,625 --> 01:18:08,375
You must be bored out of your mind.

1640
01:18:08,458 --> 01:18:10,541
Driving carpool, going to Costco.

1641
01:18:10,625 --> 01:18:13,416
You're happy with Strawberry Shortcake?
No offense, Ron.

1642
01:18:14,708 --> 01:18:18,250
- Offense taken, Leo.
- You can't talk to our dad like that.

1643
01:18:18,333 --> 01:18:20,250
The plan was simple in the beginning.

1644
01:18:20,333 --> 01:18:23,333
Get you to help steal the crown,
frame you for it, then we disappear.

1645
01:18:23,416 --> 01:18:24,375
But admit it…

1646
01:18:26,291 --> 01:18:27,500
You had fun.

1647
01:18:28,208 --> 01:18:29,541
Spark's still there.

1648
01:18:30,541 --> 01:18:31,625
Come with me.

1649
01:18:32,708 --> 01:18:34,375
What's it gonna be, Mathilde?

1650
01:18:42,250 --> 01:18:43,125
You're right.

1651
01:18:44,041 --> 01:18:45,125
Spark is still there.

1652
01:18:49,166 --> 01:18:50,333
And the name is Margot.

1653
01:18:52,291 --> 01:18:53,791
[laughing]

1654
01:18:53,875 --> 01:18:56,500
How about that, Leo? Margot and Ron.

1655
01:18:56,583 --> 01:18:59,708
- Right? Like a power couple. Like Rargot.
- Gross.

1656
01:18:59,791 --> 01:19:02,958
- We could be Rargot or Maron.
- Meet me at the dock when it's done.

1657
01:19:03,041 --> 01:19:04,708
Baxter will have the boat ready.

1658
01:19:04,791 --> 01:19:06,541
I believe this belongs to me.

1659
01:19:09,041 --> 01:19:09,875
Well...

1660
01:19:10,500 --> 01:19:12,208
I guess this is goodbye, Mathi...

1661
01:19:13,125 --> 01:19:13,958
Margot.

01:19:14,666 --> 01:19:16,958
Have fun explaining this to the Feds.

1663
01:19:19,958 --> 01:19:21,958
- [Elise] In the chair. Both of you.
- [door opens]

1664
01:19:22,500 --> 01:19:24,208
- Yes, is this the police?
- [door closes]

1665
01:19:24,291 --> 01:19:27,208
- [Elise] Yes, I-I'm calling because…
- It's OK.

1666
01:19:27,291 --> 01:19:30,250
I think I have some information
on somebody who's committed a crime.

1667
01:19:31,250 --> 01:19:32,958
I think it's a... a couple.

1668
01:19:33,250 --> 01:19:34,166
Um...

1669
01:19:34,250 --> 01:19:39,250
I mean, it's a man and a woman,
and the woman is clearly the ringleader.

1670
01:19:39,666 --> 01:19:42,000
Yeah, well,
she has blonde hair, blue eyes.

1671
01:19:42,708 --> 01:19:45,666
Um, she's wearing a sparkly,
awful pink dress.

1672
01:19:45,750 --> 01:19:47,125
- [whistles]
- And the man is…

1673
01:19:47,208 --> 01:19:49,125
- What?
- [Elise] Um, a mismatched...

1674
01:19:51,583 --> 01:19:54,666
No, the woman is clearly the one
who's running the show. Yeah.

1675
01:19:54,750 --> 01:19:57,458
[whispers] Rain?
Why are you doing rain? It's not...

1676
01:19:57,541 --> 01:20:00,958
I'm hoping you can get here quickly,
because I'm not sure what to do.

1677
01:20:01,041 --> 01:20:03,375
No, I'm just a neighbor,
I saw them walking in,

1678
01:20:03,458 --> 01:20:05,875
I was just minding my own business…

1679
01:20:05,958 --> 01:20:08,041
[whispers] What hat? You need a hat?

1680
01:20:09,875 --> 01:20:12,416
…I would say you should
bring everybody possible.

1681
01:20:14,041 --> 01:20:15,833
- [whispers] I got it.
- [whispers] What?

1682
01:20:15,916 --> 01:20:17,208
[whispers] I got it.

1683
01:20:17,291 --> 01:20:19,083
- I got this.
- [Elise] There's so many.

1684
01:20:19,583 --> 01:20:21,416
[rock music playing]

1685
01:20:21,500 --> 01:20:22,625
What are you doing?

1686
01:20:24,375 --> 01:20:25,666
[screams]

1687
01:20:25,750 --> 01:20:27,125
[kids] Oh!

1688
01:20:29,375 --> 01:20:31,666
[grunting]

1689
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:36,125
- [Margot groans]
- [Mim] Mrs. Finch!

1690
01:20:36,750 --> 01:20:38,041
[Elise screams]

1691
01:20:38,125 --> 01:20:39,750
- [Kevin] Yeah!
- [Clancy] Mom!

1692
01:20:39,833 --> 01:20:42,166
[Mim] Oh my God. No, no, no. Oh, man!

1693
01:20:42,791 --> 01:20:43,625
[Margot grunts]

1694
01:20:43,708 --> 01:20:45,541
Mom! Dad, do something!

1695
01:20:45,625 --> 01:20:46,541
I got it. I got it.

1696
01:20:50,250 --> 01:20:52,625
[kids screaming]

1697
01:20:54,458 --> 01:20:55,375
[Margot yelps]

1698
01:20:55,458 --> 01:20:57,541
Honey, I-I have the gun.
Want me to throw it to you?

1699
01:20:57,625 --> 01:20:59,458
[panting]

1700
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:02,916
- Shoot her!
- What? Shoot her? I...

1701
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:04,416
[grunting]

1702
01:21:04,500 --> 01:21:07,583
I-I-I can't shoot a gun.
I've never shot a gun before in my life!

1703
01:21:07,666 --> 01:21:09,041
I could really use some help!

1704
01:21:09,125 --> 01:21:10,958
- [Elise yelps]
- OK, OK, OK.

1705
01:21:12,291 --> 01:21:13,375
[Elise groans]

1706
01:21:13,791 --> 01:21:14,958
- [Ron screams]
- [gunshot]

1707
01:21:17,500 --> 01:21:19,166
[music fades out]

1708
01:21:19,250 --> 01:21:20,125
Oh no.

1709
01:21:20,541 --> 01:21:22,500
- [Ron] Oh!
- [panting]

1710
01:21:22,583 --> 01:21:24,708
- Hey, are you OK? Are you alright?
- Yeah.

1711
01:21:24,791 --> 01:21:25,750
- [Ron] OK.
- Ow!

1712
01:21:25,833 --> 01:21:27,208
Oh, I'm sorry. Sorry.

1713
01:21:27,291 --> 01:21:28,625
[gasps] Oh my God.

1714
01:21:28,708 --> 01:21:31,958
- [sighs]
- I killed someone. I killed somebody.

1715
01:21:33,333 --> 01:21:34,166
[sighs]

1716
01:21:34,250 --> 01:21:36,833
- [groaning]
- [Kevin] Dad, she's moving.

1717
01:21:37,416 --> 01:21:39,875
- [laughs] Yeah, she's moving!
- You didn't kill her!

1718
01:21:39,958 --> 01:21:42,750
I didn't kill somebody.
Oh, she's waking up.

1719
01:21:43,166 --> 01:21:46,333
We gotta go before Leo gets away,
or this whole thing becomes my mess.

1720
01:21:46,416 --> 01:21:49,166
- Come on. Let's go!
- [Ron] Right, right. Go, go, go.

1721
01:21:49,250 --> 01:21:51,083
[dramatic music playing]

1722
01:21:52,083 --> 01:21:55,291
I can't believe you picked up that spider,
Mr. Finch. That was so brave!

1723
01:21:55,375 --> 01:21:58,375
Oh, I don't know about brave, Lewis.
And I knew it was harmless.

1724
01:21:58,458 --> 01:22:02,000
Harmless? That was a wolf spider,
one of the most poisonous in the world.

1725
01:22:02,083 --> 01:22:05,791
It had an egg sac on its back, too,
which is, like, millions of poison babies.

1726
01:22:05,875 --> 01:22:06,916
[voice quivers] Oh.

1727
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:09,083
Mom, no, no. This isn't our car.

1728
01:22:09,166 --> 01:22:11,541
Oh my God, she's hot-wiring that car.

1729
01:22:11,916 --> 01:22:12,833
[giggles]

1730
01:22:13,208 --> 01:22:15,416
- [Clancy] Mom, you can hot-wire a car?
- [sighs]

1731
01:22:15,500 --> 01:22:16,791
Teach us to do that!

1732
01:22:16,875 --> 01:22:18,666
No! You should never do this.

1733
01:22:18,750 --> 01:22:21,375
OK, what if our phones are dead,
there's a zombie apocalypse,

1734
01:22:21,458 --> 01:22:23,500
there's a virus going around,
then, can you...

1735
01:22:23,583 --> 01:22:25,666
- [all] Kevin!
- [groans]

1736
01:22:25,750 --> 01:22:27,083
[engine revving]

1737
01:22:27,166 --> 01:22:28,708
Look, guys! Look, it's Leo.

1738
01:22:29,083 --> 01:22:31,125
- [Ron] There he is!
- [engine revving]

1739
01:22:31,208 --> 01:22:33,250
- [engine starts]
- [Kevin] My God, Mom!

1740
01:22:33,750 --> 01:22:35,000
We got it. Come on, get in!

1741
01:22:35,083 --> 01:22:36,500
[indistinct shouting]

1742
01:22:36,833 --> 01:22:37,666
Come on.

1743
01:22:37,750 --> 01:22:38,583
- Hey, honey!
- Yeah?

1744
01:22:38,666 --> 01:22:40,375
- Leo was wrong about one thing.
- What?

1745
01:22:40,833 --> 01:22:42,416
I'm the one who drives carpool.

1746
01:22:43,041 --> 01:22:44,166
Yeah, you are.

1747
01:22:44,250 --> 01:22:46,125
[rock music playing]

1748
01:22:46,208 --> 01:22:47,041
You got this!

1749
01:22:48,416 --> 01:22:49,708
[Ron] Let's save our family.

1750
01:22:49,791 --> 01:22:52,500
Woo-hoo... Oh...

1751
01:22:52,583 --> 01:22:55,291
- Look at this! This is limited edition!
- Alright.

1752
01:22:55,375 --> 01:22:56,916
- Heated seats!
- [Margot] Belts on.

1753
01:22:57,416 --> 01:22:58,750
Nice, this is so nice.

1754
01:22:58,833 --> 01:23:00,708
- [Margot] Focus. We gotta go.
- Here we go.

1755
01:23:00,791 --> 01:23:02,791
- [engine revving]
- [Kevin] Not that way!

1756
01:23:03,208 --> 01:23:04,333
- Sorry, I'm sorry.
- Dad!

1757
01:23:04,416 --> 01:23:06,375
- [Mim] No! Mr. Finch!
- The adrenaline pumping.

1758
01:23:06,458 --> 01:23:08,208
- [Clancy] Go!
- [Margot] Honey, drive!

1759
01:23:08,291 --> 01:23:09,375
[Ron] Here we go!

1760
01:23:10,375 --> 01:23:11,916
Oh, wow, this handles great!

1761
01:23:12,875 --> 01:23:14,458
Oh! This thing's got some pickup!

1762
01:23:14,541 --> 01:23:15,708
[sings] Limited edition!

1763

[engine revving]

1764
01:23:17,208 --> 01:23:18,333
[Margot] There he is!

1765
01:23:18,416 --> 01:23:19,458
He's going left!

1766
01:23:19,541 --> 01:23:21,625
- [tires screeching]
- [all screaming]

1767
01:23:21,708 --> 01:23:22,750
[panting]

1768
01:23:22,833 --> 01:23:25,833
This is an adrenaline rush for sure.
[laughs]

1769
01:23:25,916 --> 01:23:27,166
You're doing great, honey.

1770
01:23:27,250 --> 01:23:30,250

[engines revving]

1774
01:23:35,875 --> 01:23:37,625
[Ron] Oh! See how I took that turn?

1775
01:23:37,708 --> 01:23:39,791
[Margot] Cut the curb.
Don't swerve so big.

1776
01:23:39,875 --> 01:23:40,750
Dad! What now?

1777
01:23:40,833 --> 01:23:43,750
What? I don't know.
I hadn't thought that far in advance, pal!

1778
01:23:43,833 --> 01:23:44,875
What?

1779
01:23:44,958 --> 01:23:46,416
- Dad, I have an idea.
- What?

1780
01:23:46,875 --> 01:23:48,916
This is a laser pen. Maybe I could...

1781
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:51,250
What are you doing with a laser pen?

1782
01:23:52,541 --> 01:23:54,041
- [Clancy] No!
- [Mim screams]

1783
01:23:54,625 --> 01:23:55,500
Oh!

1784
01:23:56,916 --> 01:23:58,375
- [Mim screams]
- Oh, man!

1785
01:23:58,458 --> 01:24:00,125
[Mim screams] What is happening?

1786
01:24:00,208 --> 01:24:02,666
Oh, no, I don't think that came from us.

1787
01:24:02,958 --> 01:24:04,125
That was us!

1788
01:24:04,208 --> 01:24:06,208
- That was us.
- We'll leave a note.

1789
01:24:06,958 --> 01:24:08,916
- [laughs]
- [engine revving]

1790
01:24:10,708 --> 01:24:12,041
OK. Here we go. I got him.

01:24:14,541 --> 01:24:15,416

[kids screaming]

1797
01:24:25,166 --> 01:24:26,625
We are all going to die.

1798
01:24:29,958 --> 01:24:32,583
- Roll down the window. I have an idea!
- What? OK.

1799
01:24:32,666 --> 01:24:34,208
[engine revving]

1800
01:24:34,875 --> 01:24:36,125
Hey! Hey, Leo!

1801
01:24:36,833 --> 01:24:40,000
Leo! You wanna dance
with the minivan, man?

1802
01:24:40,333 --> 01:24:43,000
Well, check out this side-impact safety!

1803
01:24:43,083 --> 01:24:44,375
What?

[Ron] Everybody's OK? OK.

1810
01:25:03,458 --> 01:25:04,791
I got Leo! You get the kids!

1811
01:25:04,875 --> 01:25:06,958
- Uh, everyone OK?
- [kids] Yeah.

1812

[Ron grunts]

1814
01:25:15,000 --> 01:25:15,833
Leo!

1815
01:25:16,208 --> 01:25:17,541
I got him, honey. I got him.

[grunting]

1818
01:25:21,625 --> 01:25:24,208
Oh, any excuse
to whip out the guns, right?

1819
01:25:24,291 --> 01:25:25,750
- Uh...
- [Clancy] Mom?

1820
01:25:25,833 --> 01:25:27,875
- Yeah?
- Dad might need you more than we do.

1821
01:25:27,958 --> 01:25:29,041
I think you're right.

1822
01:25:32,958 --> 01:25:34,666
[Ron] I got him! [grunting]

1823
01:25:36,250 --> 01:25:37,250
[yelling]

1824
01:25:39,916 --> 01:25:42,375
[groans] Why are your fingers
so freakishly strong?

1825
01:25:42,458 --> 01:25:45,416
Oh, you mean my incredible
finger strength and dexterity?

1826
01:25:45,500 --> 01:25:48,208
I'm a pastry chef, Leo!

1827
01:25:48,291 --> 01:25:49,583
[panting]

1828
01:25:49,666 --> 01:25:52,375
I'm not going to jail.
I have lunch duty on Monday.
