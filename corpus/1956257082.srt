1
00:00:00,336 --> 00:00:02,015
I may take the liberty

2
00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:05,561
of beginning by saying something
about myself...

3
00:00:05,958 --> 00:00:08,865
and my role...

4
00:00:09,684 --> 00:00:12,971
in talking to you
about philosophical matters...

5
00:00:14,432 --> 00:00:18,663
because I wanted to be
understood perfectly clearly

6
00:00:19,109 --> 00:00:21,402
that I am not a guru.

7
00:00:24,057 --> 00:00:25,625
In other words...

8
00:00:26,290 --> 00:00:29,922
I talk about what we call these things...

9
00:00:30,913 --> 00:00:34,287
and that comprises a multitude of interests...

10
00:00:35,574 --> 00:00:38,071
concerning oriental philosophy...

11
00:00:38,256 --> 00:00:39,704
psychotherapy...

12
00:00:40,782 --> 00:00:43,638
religion, mysticism, etcetera.

13
00:00:44,216 --> 00:00:47,103
I talk about talk about these things
because I'm interested in them...

14
00:00:47,128 --> 00:00:49,932
and because I enjoy talking about them.

15
00:00:50,735 --> 00:00:52,911
In every sense of the person...

16
00:00:52,936 --> 00:00:56,897
who makes his living by doing
what he enjoys doing.

17
00:00:57,754 --> 00:00:59,685
And that is fading.

18
00:01:02,706 --> 00:01:05,709
Now in stating that
although I am not a guru...

19
00:01:05,926 --> 00:01:07,540
that means also...

20
00:01:08,405 --> 00:01:12,668
that I am not trying to help you,
or include you.

21
00:01:14,027 --> 00:01:16,283
I accept you as you are.

22
00:01:17,192 --> 00:01:20,121
I'm not out there for the same world.

23
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:25,387
Of course when a stream...

24
00:01:26,317 --> 00:01:27,830
a bubbling spring...

25
00:01:27,963 --> 00:01:32,083
flows out from the mountains,
it's doing it's thing.

26
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:38,329
And if a thirsty traveler helps himself,
well that's fine.

27
00:01:38,624 --> 00:01:40,195
When a bird sings...

28
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:43,962
it doesn't sing
for the advancement of music.

29
00:01:44,463 --> 00:01:49,621
But if somebody starts to listen
and is delighted, that's fine.

30
00:01:51,002 --> 00:01:53,640
And so I talk in the same spirit.

31
00:01:55,707 --> 00:01:57,293
I don't have...

32
00:01:58,457 --> 00:02:00,701
a group of followers.

33
00:02:01,371 --> 00:02:03,771
I'm not trying to make disciples.

34
00:02:04,715 --> 00:02:08,715
Because I work on the principle
of a physician...

35
00:02:09,144 --> 00:02:11,112
not as a surgeon.

36
00:02:12,933 --> 00:02:17,024
A physician is always trying
to get rid of his patients

37
00:02:17,727 --> 00:02:21,391
and send them away healthy
to stand on their own feet.

38
00:02:21,689 --> 00:02:26,001
But as a clergyman,
is trying to get the numbers...

39
00:02:26,305 --> 00:02:28,757
of the religious organization...

40
00:04:08,269 --> 00:04:10,316
Hold on one second.

41
00:04:11,442 --> 00:04:13,009
It's behind the pillow.

42
00:04:13,601 --> 00:04:14,950
Fuck.

43
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:18,133
Wait. One second, I can...

44
00:04:19,897 --> 00:04:21,304
Hold on.

45
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:28,766
Okay.

46
00:04:28,883 --> 00:04:30,372
Okay wait.

47
00:04:32,377 --> 00:04:33,785
Dr. T.

48
00:04:34,106 --> 00:04:35,476
Hold on.
I found it.

49
00:04:35,501 --> 00:04:37,828
So, hold on.
Just... I'm gonna...

50
00:04:37,953 --> 00:04:39,920
No, Dr. T, let me just... okay.

51
00:04:40,053 --> 00:04:44,289
My niece is coming tomorrow,
she's 25, she's an actress...

52
00:04:44,664 --> 00:04:47,855
we have a lot of similarities.

53
00:04:48,519 --> 00:04:52,376
But you know, my brother has
totally dropped the ball.

54
00:04:52,401 --> 00:04:54,550
He's not showing up as her dad...

55
00:04:54,575 --> 00:04:57,418
No, 'cause he's in still in rehab.

56
00:04:57,621 --> 00:04:59,564
No, for three more months.

57
00:05:00,873 --> 00:05:06,813
I think probably the reason she's an actress
is because of that I'm an actress.

58
00:05:09,405 --> 00:05:13,276
Well, she didn't really have
a lot of role models, did she?

59
00:05:15,205 --> 00:05:19,239
No, it's just I always seem
to step in and I'll try to...

60
00:05:19,264 --> 00:05:20,783
you know...

61
00:05:21,312 --> 00:05:22,929
cheer her up because...

62
00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:24,689
you know, what am I gonna say?

63
00:05:24,722 --> 00:05:28,908
Hi, your dad's in rehab for,
what, the 10th time and...

64
00:05:29,223 --> 00:05:32,143
you know, I'm sorry
he stole all your stuff?

65
00:05:32,995 --> 00:05:36,993
Dreamworks.
- Hey, Shawn. Is Peg there? It's Marie.

66
00:05:37,204 --> 00:05:39,669
Hey Marie, hold on. Let me see
if I can get her for you. Hold on.

67
00:05:39,694 --> 00:05:41,131
Okay, thanks.

68
00:05:42,827 --> 00:05:44,522
Hello.
- Hey, hey, what's up?

69
00:05:44,547 --> 00:05:47,670
I lost you up the road,
so I'm just calling you back.

70
00:05:47,826 --> 00:05:49,735
So did you hear?
- Well...

71
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:54,237
yeah, I did. I mean, unfortunately,
on the fox movie, it's not gonna happen.

72
00:05:54,325 --> 00:05:56,318
They made an offer to somebody else.

73
00:05:56,436 --> 00:05:58,459
Who was it?

74
00:05:58,970 --> 00:06:01,192
I think it's Kristen Wigg.
I'm trying to find out.

75
00:06:01,225 --> 00:06:03,373
Oh right. No, no, that makes sense.
That makes sense.

76
00:06:03,398 --> 00:06:05,465
No, it's okay.
Yeah, no, no.

77
00:06:06,051 --> 00:06:07,797
I mean, it would have been great
because at least you would have made

78
00:06:07,822 --> 00:06:09,698
a little bit of money on that but...

79
00:06:09,803 --> 00:06:11,212
Yeah, unfortunately.

80
00:06:11,237 --> 00:06:13,109
And my guess is she's gonna do it, so.

81
00:06:13,134 --> 00:06:15,547
Yeah, no, no.
- Onward, I guess.

82
00:06:16,047 --> 00:06:18,219
Right.
No, so, okay and...

83
00:06:18,244 --> 00:06:20,775
is the other thing...
what's happening with that?

84
00:06:20,875 --> 00:06:23,766
Oh yeah. I mean,
the good news is on the indie...

85
00:06:24,285 --> 00:06:28,828
they have a start date, so...
that's looking more real at least.

86
00:06:28,975 --> 00:06:30,053
Okay.

87
00:06:30,163 --> 00:06:31,455
Yeah. That looks like it might be happening.

88
00:06:31,456 --> 00:06:34,091
And I did find a solar engineer
that you can talk to.

89
00:06:34,116 --> 00:06:36,124
You know, you wanted to do
some research, you said yesterday.

90
00:06:36,149 --> 00:06:38,866
Right, right, but wait.
They have a start date?

91
00:06:38,891 --> 00:06:41,707
Did they have money?

92
00:06:42,217 --> 00:06:43,997
Well, it's not clear
if they have their money.

93
00:06:44,022 --> 00:06:45,601
They're claiming they have a start date
when they're gonna go.

94
00:06:45,602 --> 00:06:47,980
I mean, it's a sag
ultra low budget film...

95
00:06:48,005 --> 00:06:49,844
so how much money could they need?
I don't know.

96
00:06:49,869 --> 00:06:52,407
Ultra? Is ultra low?

97
00:06:52,408 --> 00:06:55,711
No, it's fine, it's fine.
It's a good script.

98
00:06:56,218 --> 00:06:57,852
Okay.
- Okay, have a good day.

99
00:06:57,877 --> 00:06:58,913
Okay.
- Okay.

100
00:06:58,914 --> 00:07:00,816
You too, bye Maria.
- Bye bye.

101
00:07:03,677 --> 00:07:04,996
Where is he?
Where is he now?

102
00:07:05,021 --> 00:07:07,560
Where is he?

103
00:07:10,934 --> 00:07:13,018
Carol!

104
00:07:16,731 --> 00:07:18,486
Did you just get here?
- I did.

105
00:07:18,511 --> 00:07:20,080
I didn't hear you.

106
00:07:21,162 --> 00:07:23,103
How about if you say:

107
00:07:23,472 --> 00:07:25,339
I now...
- Yeah.

108
00:07:25,456 --> 00:07:27,841
You gonna hate me for this, but it's really good.
- No, I'm gonna love it.

109
00:07:27,841 --> 00:07:30,634
Okay, I have 45 years...

110
00:07:30,659 --> 00:07:33,340
to draw upon every incident that I'm in.

111
00:07:33,365 --> 00:07:36,683
It's not like wow, oh God,
I'm 45, can I still do this?

112
00:07:36,708 --> 00:07:39,871
It's like, I have 45 years
worth of experience to meet...

113
00:07:39,896 --> 00:07:41,436
this brand new experience.

114
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:44,197
This moment right now.
- And I have all 45 years worth...

115
00:07:44,222 --> 00:07:45,856
of colors, and range, you know...

116
00:07:45,857 --> 00:07:47,560
everything to be in this moment.

117
00:07:47,585 --> 00:07:49,622
You know? Whether it's like
doing the most boring thing...

118
00:07:49,647 --> 00:07:51,943
or the greatest adventure you're on,
right?

119
00:07:51,968 --> 00:07:53,271
Why don't people think of that?

120
00:07:53,296 --> 00:07:57,189
I now own 45... I have in here.

121
00:07:57,214 --> 00:08:00,834
Instead they're like: I'm 45.
I can't do that anymore.

122
00:08:02,053 --> 00:08:06,285
That's fun.
That is fucking fun, right?

123
00:08:06,876 --> 00:08:07,943
Will you try it?

124
00:08:07,944 --> 00:08:09,372
Can we have an experiment?
- Yes.

125
00:08:09,397 --> 00:08:11,690
Can we be like the...
what could it be called?

126
00:08:11,691 --> 00:08:15,242
I have, I have...
- We could just start a...

127
00:08:16,387 --> 00:08:18,928
a cult. Like when people are
gonna look in the mirror and go:

128
00:08:18,953 --> 00:08:22,419
I'm just joking, I have...

129
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:26,728
I'll come to that workshop.

130
00:08:31,766 --> 00:08:33,581
You have shooters.

131
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:35,660
I don't wanna talk about it.

132
00:08:35,802 --> 00:08:39,651
Well, maybe so...
- I think, I think that...

133
00:08:40,718 --> 00:08:43,829
I'm content that that is just over.

134
00:08:44,112 --> 00:08:47,751
That's just... that era of...

135
00:08:47,884 --> 00:08:51,849
The fertility era?
- No, the seduction...

136
00:08:51,850 --> 00:08:54,700
the attraction, seduction...

137
00:08:54,833 --> 00:08:56,937
You know, oh, I'm gonna wear these...

138
00:08:57,108 --> 00:08:59,055
heels with this outfit.
- I don't believe it.

139
00:08:59,056 --> 00:09:01,900
I don't believe it.
- No, believe it.

140
00:09:02,103 --> 00:09:03,493
Believe it.
- When did it end?

141
00:09:03,494 --> 00:09:04,581
Just...
- Years ago!

142
00:09:04,606 --> 00:09:06,992
a couple of minutes ago?
- No, years ago.

143
00:09:07,143 --> 00:09:10,769
Well, you still... doll up pretty nice.

144
00:09:13,474 --> 00:09:18,273
You referring to my coif?

145
00:09:18,274 --> 00:09:19,874
I like it.
Sort of the ocean look.

146
00:09:19,875 --> 00:09:22,322
The sea breeze look, it's good.

147
00:09:22,681 --> 00:09:24,511
It's good.
You don't need to make an effort.

148
00:09:24,536 --> 00:09:27,648
You're so Au natural.

149
00:09:29,857 --> 00:09:31,554
You look good.

150
00:09:42,259 --> 00:09:44,171
Hey it's me, it's Faye.

151
00:09:44,462 --> 00:09:46,993
I'm just letting you know
that my flight lands tomorrow at 11...

152
00:09:47,028 --> 00:09:50,565
so I should be at your place around noon.

153
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:53,860
I can't wait to see you. Okay. Bye.

154
00:10:28,150 --> 00:10:32,764
Between western psychologists,
psychiatry, and psychotherapy...

155
00:10:33,522 --> 00:10:37,702
and the so-called religions of Asia
there is common ground...

156
00:10:38,597 --> 00:10:43,589
because those are interested
in changing states of human consciousness.

157
00:10:44,593 --> 00:10:48,362
Whereas, institutional western religion...

158
00:10:49,221 --> 00:10:53,439
Christianity, Judaism and even Islam...

159
00:10:53,999 --> 00:10:57,211
are relatively less interested
in this matter.

160
00:10:59,866 --> 00:11:01,655
Western religions...

161
00:11:02,186 --> 00:11:05,905
are more concerned with behavior,
doctrine...

162
00:11:08,522 --> 00:11:11,376
See, he has a colossal advantage.

163
00:11:12,516 --> 00:11:14,844
Take off your cross and follow me.

164
00:11:15,102 --> 00:11:16,694
Hey, but wait a minute.

165
00:11:16,882 --> 00:11:20,596
I don't know I'm gonna be resurrected
two days later.

166
00:11:23,057 --> 00:11:25,034
I can't perform miracles.

167
00:12:45,856 --> 00:12:48,832
Wait. Put this down, put it down.

168
00:12:55,589 --> 00:12:56,960
Wait. Just take off your shoes.

169
00:12:56,985 --> 00:13:00,074
I know, it's a pain in the ass
but it's just sandy.

170
00:13:00,474 --> 00:13:03,237
Oh my God, your hair is so nice.

171
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:08,847
Come, okay.
- Oh my god.

172
00:13:09,878 --> 00:13:12,799
This is so pretty.

173
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:16,328
Are you gonna take a picture?
- I'm gonna do a video.

174
00:13:31,137 --> 00:13:32,922
Look at this.

175
00:13:34,739 --> 00:13:37,357
It's like on top of the ocean.

176
00:13:42,475 --> 00:13:45,177
See?
It's just ocean.

177
00:13:52,710 --> 00:13:54,954
It's like a boat practically.
- What?

178
00:13:54,979 --> 00:13:57,517
It's like living in a boat practically.

179
00:14:05,201 --> 00:14:07,605
It's so good to see you.

180
00:14:08,287 --> 00:14:09,683
You know?

181
00:14:11,415 --> 00:14:12,939
How is your mom?

182
00:14:12,964 --> 00:14:14,489
She's good.

183
00:14:14,950 --> 00:14:18,317
I think she's pretty good.
She's working a lot.

184
00:14:20,656 --> 00:14:22,756
Do you still have that same boyfriend?

185
00:14:22,781 --> 00:14:24,047
Yeah?

186
00:14:24,072 --> 00:14:25,905
What's that like?
- It's the best.

187
00:14:25,930 --> 00:14:28,066
I wouldn't know.

188
00:14:28,597 --> 00:14:30,354
No, things are going really
well right now with him, so.

189
00:14:30,379 --> 00:14:33,251
You think you guys are gonna
get married and all that?

190
00:14:33,276 --> 00:14:34,286
Maybe?

191
00:14:34,810 --> 00:14:35,888
Really?

192
00:14:36,028 --> 00:14:37,758
You talk about it?

193
00:14:38,230 --> 00:14:39,499
Yeah.

194
00:14:39,964 --> 00:14:42,675
Yeah, I'd like to stay with him.

195
00:14:48,927 --> 00:14:51,561
So I'm going to West Hollywood...

196
00:14:51,928 --> 00:14:55,428
and I should be back by five.
- Cool.

197
00:14:55,453 --> 00:14:57,490
And we're gonna have a quick...

198
00:14:57,515 --> 00:14:59,604
I'm just meeting him
and then I'll come back.

199
00:14:59,629 --> 00:15:01,427
Okay, cool... Have fun.
- I'll see you.

200
00:15:01,452 --> 00:15:02,754
Thanks. And...

201
00:15:02,779 --> 00:15:06,309
You know, anything in the fridge
that you want, it's yours.

202
00:15:06,457 --> 00:15:08,688
There's water on top of the fridge.

203
00:15:09,018 --> 00:15:10,419
Where is my purse?

204
00:15:10,734 --> 00:15:16,404
Hold for a second.
I can never find my fucking purse.

205
00:15:17,832 --> 00:15:19,741
I just applied to one school.

206
00:15:19,913 --> 00:15:21,177
Which one?
- Columbia.

207
00:15:21,202 --> 00:15:23,282
And you got in... the school of engineering.
- I got in.

208
00:15:23,307 --> 00:15:24,692
Yeah.

209
00:15:25,033 --> 00:15:28,929
And I got in, I got there in '68
after that whole... you know.

210
00:15:28,954 --> 00:15:31,244
Isn't that kind of funny that
that's how you become something?

211
00:15:31,245 --> 00:15:34,313
Well, as it turns out...
- I got into Juilliard...

212
00:15:34,314 --> 00:15:36,125
so I became...
I saw that.

213
00:15:36,374 --> 00:15:39,054
You googled me.
- I did, I did.

214
00:15:39,079 --> 00:15:41,456
And I actually read something
but I didn't...

215
00:15:41,481 --> 00:15:43,893
It's all lies.
- Well, I don't know if it's lies...

216
00:15:43,918 --> 00:15:46,770
but I didn't read...
I didn't see anything, unfortunately.

217
00:15:46,918 --> 00:15:50,137
No images? You didn't...
- I saw the images, yeah.

218
00:15:50,425 --> 00:15:52,753
So I know who I'm looking at.
- I see what you mean.

219
00:15:52,778 --> 00:15:55,266
You did not see me...
- I didn't get to look, I didn't like it...

220
00:15:55,267 --> 00:15:56,767
pretend to be other people.
- Yes.

221
00:15:56,768 --> 00:15:58,391
Right, I didn't see that.

222
00:15:58,516 --> 00:16:00,601
That's okay.
- But I saw that people liked your work.

223
00:16:00,626 --> 00:16:03,187
Oh, that's nice.
- Yeah. They do!

224
00:16:04,543 --> 00:16:07,218
All right. So...
- This is a pyronometer.

225
00:16:07,608 --> 00:16:09,386
This is, we use this for...

226
00:16:09,411 --> 00:16:10,673
What is it?
- Well...

227
00:16:10,698 --> 00:16:12,781
Do I need to put this in context
before we start...

228
00:16:12,806 --> 00:16:14,202
or you wanna talk about the instruments?

229
00:16:14,227 --> 00:16:17,291
I mean, I know you're researching
something here, but...

230
00:16:17,316 --> 00:16:19,683
But what is it?
- It measures sunlight.

231
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:22,923
You see this little black thing
inside the two plastic domes...

232
00:16:22,924 --> 00:16:24,554
in the glass domes?

233
00:16:24,719 --> 00:16:27,328
That's a thermopile.

234
00:16:27,329 --> 00:16:28,738
This thing.
- No, no.

235
00:16:28,763 --> 00:16:29,736
That.
- That.

236
00:16:29,761 --> 00:16:31,606
Inside the black, the little black...

237
00:16:31,631 --> 00:16:35,017
thing in the middle, the black disk.
- The black circle is a thermopile.

238
00:16:35,042 --> 00:16:36,224
Thermopile.
- Pile.

239
00:16:36,249 --> 00:16:38,650
Yes. It might love sun,
temperature too...

240
00:16:38,675 --> 00:16:40,734
but it's a thermopile.
- Okay.

241
00:16:40,759 --> 00:16:43,476
And what happens
is when the sun shines on it...

242
00:16:43,501 --> 00:16:45,212
it's black and absorbs the heat.

243
00:16:45,321 --> 00:16:48,524
And it absorbs broad-spectrum radiation...

244
00:16:48,649 --> 00:16:53,185
and it... it's really what it is,
is a bunch of little thermocouples...

245
00:16:53,210 --> 00:16:55,820
which are bi-metal devices that...

246
00:16:56,789 --> 00:17:01,469
when tempera... when heat flows
from hot to cold...

247
00:17:01,579 --> 00:17:03,870
generate a small current.

248
00:17:04,073 --> 00:17:07,076
We're, you know,
looking for bankable data...

249
00:17:07,101 --> 00:17:10,145
which is what they call it.
The data you can take to the bank...

250
00:17:10,170 --> 00:17:13,201
convince investors that there's a...

251
00:17:13,357 --> 00:17:15,887
a viable solar or wind facility...

252
00:17:16,067 --> 00:17:19,575
and go ahead and get people
to put up money...

253
00:17:19,576 --> 00:17:21,967
and then we're talking
serious money, you know?

254
00:17:21,992 --> 00:17:24,311
And are they putting up money for...

255
00:17:24,389 --> 00:17:27,182
solar panels and windmills?
- They're putting, yeah...

256
00:17:27,207 --> 00:17:29,844
solar panels, wind turbines...
- And you measure with things like this.

257
00:17:29,869 --> 00:17:32,703
Things like this.
- How much energy is hitting the ground.

258
00:17:32,728 --> 00:17:34,726
What is this thing?
This one measures the beam...

259
00:17:34,751 --> 00:17:37,721
the direct beam of the sun
into the, you know, the...

260
00:17:37,746 --> 00:17:39,439
what you see when you stare at the sun.

261
00:17:39,464 --> 00:17:40,654
Right.
- Yeah, that beam.

262
00:17:40,679 --> 00:17:44,447
So this measures the overall
illumination of the sky...

263
00:17:44,472 --> 00:17:45,950
and this measures the beam.

264
00:17:45,975 --> 00:17:49,817
This includes the beam,
but this measures only the beam.

265
00:18:25,369 --> 00:18:29,062
It seemed like everybody else
was already really successful...

266
00:18:29,087 --> 00:18:33,798
and I was this broke, like,
girl from New York with...

267
00:18:33,954 --> 00:18:39,109
you know, ripped jeans
and my dad's overcoat.

268
00:18:39,134 --> 00:18:42,572
And I would go for meetings
and these women were already...

269
00:18:42,704 --> 00:18:45,804
they had, they were, you know,
they were 25 years old...

270
00:18:45,829 --> 00:18:48,181
and they were making so much money...

271
00:18:48,206 --> 00:18:50,220
and so they would show up
looking like that.

272
00:18:50,245 --> 00:18:53,783
And I would arrive
in my rental car, like...

273
00:18:54,142 --> 00:18:56,070
And I would get feedback too, like:

274
00:18:56,095 --> 00:18:57,390
She's not pretty enough.

275
00:18:57,415 --> 00:18:59,790
But really what it meant is, like...

276
00:18:59,815 --> 00:19:02,969
I wasn't in the right,
I didn't have the Gucci shoes...

277
00:19:02,970 --> 00:19:05,986
and the pencil skirt.
- Right, sounds terrible.

278
00:19:06,978 --> 00:19:09,914
Well, I also think I wasn't,
I think I was self-conscious.

279
00:19:09,939 --> 00:19:13,376
I wasn't... I mean, it's my... thing.

280
00:19:13,401 --> 00:19:17,353
I just wanted to be around
people who were all working.

281
00:19:17,751 --> 00:19:20,385
That seemed exciting to me, like...
- Yeah.

282
00:19:21,642 --> 00:19:23,275
comparing notes.

283
00:19:26,432 --> 00:19:30,064
I didn't, it didn't...
I mean, I would be really sad...

284
00:19:30,089 --> 00:19:32,094
if I didn't get a part that I wanted.

285
00:19:32,095 --> 00:19:34,696
And I remember I would,
you know, I had all...

286
00:19:34,721 --> 00:19:36,845
I would... if there was a sidewalk...

287
00:19:36,870 --> 00:19:39,417
I wouldn't step on the crack, you know.

288
00:19:39,534 --> 00:19:42,329
I still pick up pennies.

289
00:19:42,486 --> 00:19:45,439
Do you do that?
I see a penny, I pick it up.

290
00:19:45,580 --> 00:19:47,384
Oh, that's awesome.

291
00:19:49,391 --> 00:19:50,491
I mean, waiting...

292
00:19:50,516 --> 00:19:52,968
If a director was
trying to decide whether...

293
00:19:52,993 --> 00:19:57,352
you know, I would hear from someone:
Oh, it's between you and so-and-so...

294
00:19:57,540 --> 00:19:59,500
and he just can't decide.

295
00:19:59,727 --> 00:20:02,625
So, you know, there's three...

296
00:20:03,914 --> 00:20:07,303
She's blonde and you're not,
so if they cast so-and-so...

297
00:20:07,328 --> 00:20:08,764
There's also, like, maybe...

298
00:20:08,789 --> 00:20:10,414
So they're just waiting to find out.

299
00:20:10,439 --> 00:20:12,242
And I would spend two months...

300
00:20:12,367 --> 00:20:17,021
you know, not stepping on cracks
and picking up pennies.

301
00:20:34,924 --> 00:20:36,361
Get lost.

302
00:20:37,322 --> 00:20:38,916
You said it yourself.

303
00:20:40,572 --> 00:20:42,749
Like children love to play
hide and seek...

304
00:20:43,663 --> 00:20:45,715
Get lost, like we all like to go to a play.

305
00:20:45,740 --> 00:20:48,213
It's all glass windows...

306
00:20:48,330 --> 00:20:52,096
so like, you just look out from the
kitchen and all you can see is the ocean.

307
00:20:52,121 --> 00:20:55,252
It's the coolest thing.
You just don't see anything else.

308
00:20:55,370 --> 00:20:59,009
Honey, I'm sure it's lovely.
- It's so great.

309
00:20:59,034 --> 00:21:02,502
You know what? Send me a picture.
Post a picture on Facebook, tomorrow...

310
00:21:02,527 --> 00:21:03,954
Okay.
- and I'll see.

311
00:21:03,979 --> 00:21:05,643
I will.
- Okay.

312
00:21:05,831 --> 00:21:07,713
I'll give you a video tour.

313
00:21:09,510 --> 00:21:12,420
I really miss you.
- I miss you too, I love you.

314
00:21:13,815 --> 00:21:15,377
I love you too.

315
00:21:15,620 --> 00:21:19,510
You think... you think I could see,
you think you could...

316
00:21:21,057 --> 00:21:24,017
I don't know how to put this
delicately...

317
00:21:24,415 --> 00:21:27,548
Okay.
- I'd really like to see your breasts.

318
00:21:31,095 --> 00:21:33,501
Right now?
- Yeah. Yeah!

319
00:21:35,369 --> 00:21:38,798
I'm kind of just in the middle
of the living room, right.

320
00:21:40,509 --> 00:21:44,267
Is she asleep?
- Yeah, but I'm scared.

321
00:21:46,978 --> 00:21:49,306
I think it's okay.

322
00:21:51,376 --> 00:21:52,992
You don't have to do a whole show.

323
00:21:53,017 --> 00:21:55,548
I just wanna see, you know,
can you show me a little bit?

324
00:21:55,573 --> 00:21:56,759
Yeah.

325
00:22:02,506 --> 00:22:05,213
Can you see? Those are my boobs.
- Yeah. Oh yeah.

326
00:22:05,238 --> 00:22:07,580
Do you like them?
- Yeah. Yes!

327
00:22:08,838 --> 00:22:12,033
Oh my gosh.
- You can't talk that loud.

328
00:22:12,362 --> 00:22:13,612
Sorry.

329
00:22:14,488 --> 00:22:15,666
It's okay.

330
00:22:16,088 --> 00:22:17,963
What's happened, what's going on?
- I'm so sorry.

331
00:22:17,988 --> 00:22:20,858
I'm just... we're just looking at photos.

332
00:22:21,123 --> 00:22:22,657
No, that's Marie.

333
00:22:22,967 --> 00:22:24,287
Oh my god.

334
00:22:25,381 --> 00:22:28,856
I'm sorry. I didn't know
this is video chat, okay?

335
00:22:28,881 --> 00:22:31,756
Yeah, I'm live, the live feed.

336
00:22:31,881 --> 00:22:33,694
It's nice to meet you.

337
00:22:34,662 --> 00:22:36,629
It's really nice to meet you.
- Yeah.

338
00:22:36,630 --> 00:22:38,217
Can you see?
- I thought you were just working...

339
00:22:38,242 --> 00:22:39,944
Were we disturbing you?

340
00:22:40,123 --> 00:22:42,505
No, no, I just don't sleep at night.

341
00:22:43,130 --> 00:22:44,895
I have insomnia.

342
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:46,894
I was just gonna get a glass of water.

343
00:22:46,919 --> 00:22:49,184
Oh, you're so cute. He's so cute.

344
00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:51,630
I know.
- Well done.

345
00:22:52,169 --> 00:22:54,278
And well done, sir.

346
00:22:54,723 --> 00:22:58,411
Okay, enjoy yourselves.
I'm gonna go back to...

347
00:22:58,559 --> 00:23:00,286
Okay, do you need us to be quiet?
- No, no...

348
00:23:00,311 --> 00:23:03,655
you didn't wake me up,
I'm listening to my audio books.

349
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:05,109
Okay.

350
00:23:05,726 --> 00:23:08,203
That's why I didn't wanna do that.

351
00:23:08,502 --> 00:23:09,995
Nice meeting you.

352
00:23:10,020 --> 00:23:12,260
I've never worn a wetsuit before.

353
00:23:12,285 --> 00:23:14,018
It's great. You're gonna like the...

354
00:23:14,043 --> 00:23:15,620
I like it.
I wish...

355
00:23:15,791 --> 00:23:18,932
I sort of like the wetsuit feeling.

356
00:23:19,082 --> 00:23:22,347
No, like, I wish I had this kind of...

357
00:23:22,542 --> 00:23:26,253
other layer of protection all the time,
you know?

358
00:23:26,546 --> 00:23:28,198
Okay.

359
00:23:31,994 --> 00:23:34,510
Actually, can you do me a favor?

360
00:23:34,535 --> 00:23:36,393
You wanna zip me up and I'll zip you up?

361
00:23:36,418 --> 00:23:37,697
Yeah.

362
00:23:38,410 --> 00:23:39,760
They're finished.

363
00:23:39,785 --> 00:23:41,955
They do make it so...
- Yeah.

364
00:23:43,837 --> 00:23:45,362
Thank you.

365
00:24:33,536 --> 00:24:35,129
Oh my god!

366
00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:50,909
Okay... so just hang 'em...

367
00:24:51,112 --> 00:24:53,635
You can hang 'em
on the back of the chair.

368
00:24:53,660 --> 00:24:55,804
Okay.
- I'll grab the towels.

369
00:25:02,168 --> 00:25:05,029
It's stuck on my feet.
- I'm gonna help you.

370
00:25:08,812 --> 00:25:10,363
Sit down.

371
00:25:13,270 --> 00:25:15,806
No one can see.

372
00:25:20,809 --> 00:25:23,114
Okay.
- Thanks.

373
00:25:24,535 --> 00:25:27,637
Just hold... actually take your towel
and hold it in front of you.

374
00:25:27,662 --> 00:25:29,797
Like, over your boobies.

375
00:25:30,489 --> 00:25:32,606
They're great boobs.
- You have great boobs.

376
00:25:32,631 --> 00:25:34,339
No, I had great boobs.
- No, you have...

377
00:25:34,364 --> 00:25:37,174
You know, my boobs used to be
up here somewhere.

378
00:25:37,199 --> 00:25:39,151
They're gorgeous.
- And then they go down.

379
00:25:39,176 --> 00:25:40,809
No.
- Yes. No, they do.

380
00:25:40,834 --> 00:25:44,864
You have to enjoy these
while they're... while they're up.

381
00:25:45,129 --> 00:25:50,223
Let's do it, wait, hold on.
We're gonna preserve them for posterity.

382
00:25:50,403 --> 00:25:51,770
Hold!

383
00:25:53,569 --> 00:25:57,342
I'm not looking forward to taking
my clothes off the way I used to.

384
00:25:57,560 --> 00:25:59,832
It used to be great, I couldn't wait.
- Yeah?

385
00:25:59,857 --> 00:26:02,168
Like, can we just get through all this...

386
00:26:02,193 --> 00:26:03,996
stuff that makes me nervous,
like the dinner,

387
00:26:04,021 --> 00:26:06,350
and the talking, and everything,
and to the I'll just...

388
00:26:06,375 --> 00:26:10,975
take my pants off, my shirt
and you'll be really happy.

389
00:26:13,359 --> 00:26:17,865
So what do you...
how do you navigate that, though?

390
00:26:18,943 --> 00:26:20,435
It's awkward.

391
00:26:20,687 --> 00:26:23,826
I'm sure they probably feel
self-conscious too.

392
00:26:23,982 --> 00:26:26,707
Like it's, like they're looking at images
of all these women...

393
00:26:26,739 --> 00:26:29,427
but they're not the same
like they used to be either.

394
00:26:29,545 --> 00:26:30,879
I guess it's different for boys.

395
00:26:30,904 --> 00:26:32,803
I don't know why but I think it's dif...

396
00:26:32,828 --> 00:26:35,584
I, I... maybe they feel...

397
00:26:37,943 --> 00:26:42,021
Well, they... they might feel insecure, but...

398
00:26:48,224 --> 00:26:50,435
it seems more...

399
00:26:52,623 --> 00:26:53,841
it's...

400
00:26:54,638 --> 00:26:58,716
I felt more pressure in my life
to be the object of...

401
00:26:58,741 --> 00:26:59,755
you know?
- Right.

402
00:26:59,780 --> 00:27:02,919
The thing that ma...
the engine for why it's...

403
00:27:03,271 --> 00:27:04,786
hot.
- Right.

404
00:27:05,410 --> 00:27:09,661
The image that starts
the ball rolling or something.

405
00:27:23,718 --> 00:27:26,460
I'm worried that we're squishing them.

406
00:27:27,952 --> 00:27:30,531
You think we're squishing them?
- Probably.

407
00:27:30,556 --> 00:27:33,999
Wait, I should stay up here
'cause the... this light's amazing.

408
00:27:34,155 --> 00:27:36,054
Then this light?

409
00:27:36,202 --> 00:27:39,296
Awful?
- Yeah, well, it's very artsy.

410
00:27:39,476 --> 00:27:42,907
That's what I was thinking.
- This looks like an album cover.

411
00:27:48,045 --> 00:27:50,627
Medicine in Jefferson and Lincoln.

412
00:27:51,135 --> 00:27:53,423
Is it to do with facial hair?
- No.

413
00:27:53,448 --> 00:27:55,329
Is it to do with their appearance at all?
- No.

414
00:27:55,354 --> 00:27:57,454
Is it to do with their policies?
- No.

415
00:27:57,479 --> 00:27:59,852
Is it to do with their personalities?
- No.

416
00:27:59,877 --> 00:28:01,958
Is it to do with their sexual orientation?
- No.

417
00:28:01,983 --> 00:28:03,761
Yes, they're all transgendered.

418
00:28:03,762 --> 00:28:05,961
Didn't you know that?
- Those four...

419
00:28:06,494 --> 00:28:10,744
Does it have to do with the fact
that they're all on Mount Everest?

420
00:28:24,495 --> 00:28:26,011
No, I'm not gonna say.

421
00:28:26,012 --> 00:28:27,555
Why?
- 'Cause then you'll...

422
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:30,229
Maybe you'll steal it.
I don't know you very well.

423
00:28:31,870 --> 00:28:35,021
Hi guys.
- Did you see that lightening?

424
00:28:35,269 --> 00:28:36,543
Yes.

425
00:28:36,683 --> 00:28:38,183
Hi, my love.

426
00:28:38,801 --> 00:28:40,777
Did you have a good day, monkey, monkey?

427
00:28:40,802 --> 00:28:43,191
Yes, and you?
- Little monkey.

428
00:28:43,340 --> 00:28:45,024
All right, sorry,
I don't wanna interrupt.

429
00:28:45,049 --> 00:28:47,008
These are my friends.
This is Suzanne.

430
00:28:47,033 --> 00:28:49,815
Oh, hello.
- Hi, I'm Marie, nice to meet you.

431
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:51,035
Hi, Dan.
- Hi Dan.

432
00:28:51,060 --> 00:28:52,133
Marie.
- Nice to meet you.

433
00:28:52,158 --> 00:28:53,665
I'm really glad you guys are here.

434
00:28:53,690 --> 00:28:55,501
Yeah, it's a great place.
- Enjoying it?

435
00:28:56,643 --> 00:28:57,946
It's beautiful.

436
00:28:58,455 --> 00:29:01,291
Yeah, we've definitely been enjoying
this deck.

437
00:29:02,338 --> 00:29:05,047
I'm really sorry.
I think I broke your toilet seat.

438
00:29:05,048 --> 00:29:06,493
No, no, it's not broken.

439
00:29:06,518 --> 00:29:07,993
I promise you.
- No, I think I broke it just now.

440
00:29:08,018 --> 00:29:10,802
You didn't.
I know it seems like you might...

441
00:29:10,912 --> 00:29:14,871
That you broke it to you,
but it's bin, it's an old toilet seat.

442
00:29:14,896 --> 00:29:16,059
It was already broken?

443
00:29:16,084 --> 00:29:17,285
It was already broken.
- Oh, okay.

444
00:29:17,310 --> 00:29:21,302
Yeah, no. It was here, you know,
it's a cheap rental toilet seat.

445
00:29:21,427 --> 00:29:24,199
I thought I... I lifted it up,
I'm really high, I'm sorry.

446
00:29:24,224 --> 00:29:25,966
Are you gonna...
- It's okay.

447
00:29:25,967 --> 00:29:27,591
Are you gonna blend that?

448
00:29:27,896 --> 00:29:29,279
Yeah. Do you want some?

449
00:29:29,396 --> 00:29:30,559
Yeah.
- That's good.

450
00:29:30,584 --> 00:29:32,191
Wait, can I smoke before you...?

451
00:29:32,216 --> 00:29:33,560
Oh, of course.

452
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:35,074
Yeah, no.
Go ahead.

453
00:29:35,099 --> 00:29:38,068
I thought I broke your toilet seat.
- But you didn't.

454
00:29:38,393 --> 00:29:40,142
I was so worried.

455
00:29:41,572 --> 00:29:45,446
I was like... alright, you have to go
in her kitchen now, you know?

456
00:29:49,014 --> 00:29:50,090
'Cause now...

457
00:29:50,115 --> 00:29:53,131
'Cause now, first you're not hanging out...

458
00:29:53,264 --> 00:29:55,668
with other people because
you're so busy staring at a screen...

459
00:29:55,693 --> 00:29:57,685
but now we're not hanging out with each other
'cause we're so busy...

460
00:29:57,710 --> 00:30:00,302
staring at ourselves on screen.

461
00:30:01,419 --> 00:30:03,607
Is that what kale tastes like?

462
00:30:05,597 --> 00:30:07,903
That's what kale tastes like.
- Okay.

463
00:30:10,482 --> 00:30:12,008
Just drink it down.
You're going to feel good.

464
00:30:12,009 --> 00:30:13,035
What else is in there?
- Just drink that down.

465
00:30:13,060 --> 00:30:15,487
You're supposed to drink it all at once?

466
00:30:56,329 --> 00:30:57,616
Great.

467
00:30:59,081 --> 00:31:02,829
You know, I sit on it and I slip, right?

468
00:31:03,302 --> 00:31:04,502
This is bad.

469
00:31:04,527 --> 00:31:07,055
I don't think you can fix it.
It's just a cheap rental.

470
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:08,703
No, I can... look.

471
00:31:09,186 --> 00:31:10,727
See?
- Wait, I didn't know that...

472
00:31:10,728 --> 00:31:11,863
See that bolt, yeah.

473
00:31:11,888 --> 00:31:15,067
It's like a little secret hatch
and then under here is the...

474
00:31:16,180 --> 00:31:17,403
Wait.

475
00:31:19,257 --> 00:31:21,155
Put your hand under there.

476
00:31:21,551 --> 00:31:24,300
See, that's where the bolt
comes out through there?

477
00:31:24,739 --> 00:31:27,206
I never would have known that.

478
00:31:27,632 --> 00:31:28,866
Yeah.

479
00:31:31,335 --> 00:31:33,445
And that just pops back in.

480
00:31:49,203 --> 00:31:50,224
That's...

481
00:31:50,249 --> 00:31:52,882
No more spectacle...
- Here, try it out.

482
00:31:52,907 --> 00:31:55,228
I can actually like, It doesn't...
It didn't move.

483
00:31:55,253 --> 00:31:57,566
Yeah, that's the way
you could have been...

484
00:31:57,591 --> 00:31:58,983
For a year.
- For a year...

485
00:31:59,008 --> 00:32:01,072
you could have been doing it like that.

486
00:32:01,097 --> 00:32:03,561
See, this is good.
- Nice.

487
00:32:03,944 --> 00:32:05,451
I'm thinking right here.

488
00:32:07,930 --> 00:32:09,389
Does that seem...
- Yeah. Yeah.

489
00:32:09,414 --> 00:32:11,019
That's where you want it?
- Well, does it seem high?

490
00:32:11,044 --> 00:32:12,703
Does it seem right to you...

491
00:32:12,728 --> 00:32:14,709
if it was your house?

492
00:32:15,775 --> 00:32:18,005
Hold on. Let me go...

493
00:32:18,637 --> 00:32:19,929
Oh yeah.

494
00:32:25,300 --> 00:32:26,636
Hey, how's it going?
- Come on in.

495
00:32:26,661 --> 00:32:27,886
Okay. Can I...

496
00:32:28,134 --> 00:32:30,231
Just hang your coat right there.
Did that seem right?

497
00:32:30,256 --> 00:32:31,976
That felt good.
- Okay.

498
00:32:39,861 --> 00:32:42,622
Oh, this is so great.
- Yeah?

499
00:33:07,053 --> 00:33:10,468
What I really liked about
your last movie was...

500
00:33:10,469 --> 00:33:13,388
sort of the combination
between horror and comedy.

501
00:33:15,071 --> 00:33:19,006
So it seems like that's something
you're continuing with?

502
00:33:19,245 --> 00:33:21,673
Yeah, I think I have
a morbid sense of humor...

503
00:33:21,698 --> 00:33:23,967
so I think there will
always be some of that...

504
00:33:23,992 --> 00:33:25,611
you know, on display.

505
00:33:25,732 --> 00:33:28,970
But I wouldn't consider it
say horror-comedy per Se.

506
00:33:29,112 --> 00:33:31,346
I think it's a genuine story
about it's loneliness...

507
00:33:31,371 --> 00:33:34,389
and about the isolation
that being a vampire is.

508
00:33:34,482 --> 00:33:35,703
And at the same time...

509
00:33:35,728 --> 00:33:38,090
just being a single person
in the modern ages.

510
00:33:38,196 --> 00:33:40,774
So I think that it's just...
they're good parallels.

511
00:33:40,886 --> 00:33:42,500
Yeah, totally.

512
00:33:43,317 --> 00:33:45,707
What... do you know what the movie's about?
- I have no idea.

513
00:33:45,732 --> 00:33:48,133
I think it's something to do
with a private detective.

514
00:33:48,822 --> 00:33:50,139
I don't know much about it.

515
00:33:50,164 --> 00:33:53,843
I'm here because I missed
his last movie and...

516
00:33:54,475 --> 00:33:56,123
I just have to make up for it now...

517
00:33:56,159 --> 00:33:57,803
so it doesn't seem
like I'm a terrible friend.

518
00:33:57,828 --> 00:33:59,935
But we're not real friends actually.

519
00:34:00,077 --> 00:34:01,721
So, just be like looking at me
and then...

520
00:34:01,746 --> 00:34:02,862
Yes.

521
00:34:02,997 --> 00:34:04,638
I was... I loved...

522
00:34:07,151 --> 00:34:08,926
All right, I really like this place.
- Yes.

523
00:34:08,951 --> 00:34:10,526
It's got a nice...

524
00:34:10,551 --> 00:34:12,150
Oh gosh.

525
00:34:33,756 --> 00:34:36,115
I'm good. How are you?

526
00:34:37,098 --> 00:34:38,324
Good.

527
00:34:38,722 --> 00:34:40,636
I'm... I just wanted to say good night.

528
00:34:40,661 --> 00:34:42,227
I'm actually out with a bunch of people

529
00:34:42,252 --> 00:34:44,368
and I think we're gonna stay out
pretty late, so...

530
00:34:44,393 --> 00:34:46,648
I wanted to say good night now.

531
00:34:50,087 --> 00:34:51,533
I love you too.

532
00:34:52,555 --> 00:34:54,140
I miss you a lot.

533
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:25,911
I... How do you do iPhone...

534
00:35:25,936 --> 00:35:28,430
if you're gonna... if you stay...
- I do it like this.

535
00:35:28,586 --> 00:35:30,625
So, can I ask you?
Are you...

536
00:35:30,734 --> 00:35:32,771
If you're talking to people
and you say like...

537
00:35:32,796 --> 00:35:34,266
'well, I'm gonna...'

538
00:35:34,267 --> 00:35:35,668
Do you do that?

539
00:35:35,851 --> 00:35:37,959
Yeah, sometimes.
- Like, you mime it?

540
00:35:37,984 --> 00:35:41,578
Yeah, or when I, like I'm like,
and I wrote a...

541
00:35:53,498 --> 00:35:55,076
Oh god.

542
00:35:56,475 --> 00:35:58,100
I'm just...

543
00:36:00,463 --> 00:36:01,729
Okay.

544
00:36:02,885 --> 00:36:06,877
I'm sorry, you can talk.
- No, no, I don't wanna say anything.

545
00:36:13,712 --> 00:36:14,971
I mean...

546
00:36:17,650 --> 00:36:19,251
Oh, a really nice hot tub.

547
00:36:19,276 --> 00:36:21,142
That's the way it should be. It's yours.
It's my hot tub.

548
00:36:21,167 --> 00:36:22,703
I shouldn't be saying that.

549
00:36:22,728 --> 00:36:25,142
Is it conceded to say 'you have
a nice hot tub', is the question?

550
00:36:25,167 --> 00:36:27,000
How long are your parents out of town?

551
00:36:27,025 --> 00:36:28,945
My parents...
I actually don't know.

552
00:36:28,970 --> 00:36:30,962
I just sent them an email asking them...

553
00:36:30,987 --> 00:36:34,228
if I could use the hot tub
and they said yeah.

554
00:36:42,954 --> 00:36:44,762
You drink this water out of a bowl?

555
00:36:44,787 --> 00:36:46,969
You want some water?
- No.

556
00:36:58,850 --> 00:37:03,687
I have a boyfriend so I feel
like I shouldn't do that.

557
00:37:04,203 --> 00:37:05,312
Okay.

558
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:06,915
I understand.

559
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:11,290
You gonna come back outside?

560
00:38:10,541 --> 00:38:14,134
Okay, I think this is gonna be
really good for you.

561
00:38:16,380 --> 00:38:18,450
And you might not want it...

562
00:38:18,892 --> 00:38:20,845
but I think you're gonna like it.

563
00:38:20,988 --> 00:38:22,591
I'm sorry.
- Oh no, don't.

564
00:38:24,884 --> 00:38:27,797
Don't worry. You know, I understand.

565
00:38:27,822 --> 00:38:30,391
I had way too many mornings like that.

566
00:38:30,416 --> 00:38:33,711
Here's two acetaminophen that you're
gonna drink when this is done.

567
00:38:33,736 --> 00:38:37,455
Now, okay, I have something
that you're really gonna love.

568
00:38:37,587 --> 00:38:41,220
It's a very loud noise
so I want you to brace yourself.

569
00:38:41,245 --> 00:38:43,016
Just hold on to me tight.

570
00:38:43,041 --> 00:38:45,986
We're together in this.
You ready?

571
00:38:47,017 --> 00:38:49,790
Oh, oh, the poor.

572
00:38:54,404 --> 00:38:56,261
Little monkey.

573
00:38:56,832 --> 00:38:59,351
Little monkey overdid it.

574
00:39:08,692 --> 00:39:10,800
Oh god.

575
00:39:11,777 --> 00:39:13,300
Here, I'll finish it.

576
00:39:13,964 --> 00:39:15,363
Are you gonna throw up?

577
00:39:15,387 --> 00:39:16,796
Oh, are you? Are you?

578
00:39:16,821 --> 00:39:18,995
Forgive me.

579
00:39:23,743 --> 00:39:25,444
Sorry.
- I'm sorry.

580
00:39:31,608 --> 00:39:34,538
It's really okay.
You're gonna be okay.

581
00:39:44,413 --> 00:39:46,905
Do you think that's it?
- I think so.

582
00:39:47,056 --> 00:39:49,069
Okay, let's get out of here.

583
00:39:54,609 --> 00:39:58,086
This is a global station
in which we're measuring...

584
00:39:58,111 --> 00:40:00,359
you know, the whole dome of the sky.

585
00:40:00,384 --> 00:40:01,522
Okay.

586
00:40:01,547 --> 00:40:03,476
There are no beam measurements.

587
00:40:03,477 --> 00:40:06,209
If you notice, they got
the little domed instruments out on the...

588
00:40:06,234 --> 00:40:09,930
south side of this thing
on these little wings over there.

589
00:40:09,955 --> 00:40:11,094
Oh, the things...

590
00:40:11,119 --> 00:40:12,663
Yeah, the little...
- Yeah, exactly...

591
00:40:12,688 --> 00:40:14,639
Is this thing under it that beam thing?

592
00:40:14,664 --> 00:40:16,819
No, that's there is no beam
measurement here.

593
00:40:16,844 --> 00:40:18,556
That's just, we call that a cross arm.
Cross arm.

594
00:40:18,557 --> 00:40:20,225
Just a support.
- Okay.

595
00:40:20,359 --> 00:40:23,170
And we're also measuring
relative humidity, in that.

596
00:40:23,195 --> 00:40:26,398
What's the name of the dome?
- Pyronometer.

597
00:40:26,423 --> 00:40:28,944
The pyronometer.
So there's two pyronometers.

598
00:40:28,969 --> 00:40:30,241
For redundancy.

599
00:40:30,266 --> 00:40:34,084
This is a John installation.

600
00:40:34,109 --> 00:40:37,227
He always puts the fencepost
on top of that and...

601
00:40:37,252 --> 00:40:40,611
and tapes up all the excess cable...
like a mummy.

602
00:40:40,820 --> 00:40:42,352
You know, this is...

603
00:40:42,377 --> 00:40:45,594
you know, you can see where all the wires,
all the colored wires are?

604
00:40:45,782 --> 00:40:47,797
Those are the...

605
00:40:47,945 --> 00:40:52,422
sensors, all landed on little terminals
in the logger.

606
00:40:52,617 --> 00:40:54,022
So this is coming...

607
00:40:54,047 --> 00:40:55,976
No, this, that's just battery...

608
00:40:56,001 --> 00:40:58,640
and solar panel stuff
on the right hand side.

609
00:40:58,812 --> 00:41:01,531
Okay, where's
the pyronometer measurement?

610
00:41:01,556 --> 00:41:02,656
Those are all in there.

611
00:41:02,681 --> 00:41:04,867
Into this.
- Into that, that's correct.

612
00:41:04,961 --> 00:41:07,647
All of these things are
sort of tuned and calibrated.

613
00:41:07,672 --> 00:41:09,414
They're well established.

614
00:41:09,523 --> 00:41:10,842
You know, it doesn't take very...

615
00:41:10,867 --> 00:41:12,342
you know, you don't have to
start from scratch.

616
00:41:12,367 --> 00:41:14,273
You're not baking a cake from...

617
00:41:14,609 --> 00:41:17,092
you know, basic... ferm... mix...
from ingredients.

618
00:41:17,117 --> 00:41:18,953
You're basic baking it
from mix, you know.

619
00:41:18,978 --> 00:41:21,172
You're basically...

620
00:41:21,375 --> 00:41:23,311
A lot of this is sort of set.
- So you're saying this is like...

621
00:41:23,336 --> 00:41:24,436
an instant cake.

622
00:41:24,461 --> 00:41:25,881
It is like an instant cake.

623
00:41:25,906 --> 00:41:29,054
It... you know, it's like
inexpensive ice cream.

624
00:41:29,242 --> 00:41:32,711
And when we put these things in,
we have to...

625
00:41:33,390 --> 00:41:35,593
you know, we have to document
this thing thoroughly.

626
00:41:35,594 --> 00:41:38,045
You know, this is all bankable data,
so everybody wants to know...

627
00:41:38,070 --> 00:41:40,170
the serial number of every
instrument that's out there.

628
00:41:40,195 --> 00:41:42,092
They wanna know how it's calibrated.
- Right.

629
00:41:42,117 --> 00:41:44,600
You take, you know,
exhaustive photographs...

630
00:41:44,625 --> 00:41:46,594
of how each thing is mounted.

631
00:41:46,711 --> 00:41:48,633
We... every photograph is like...

632
00:41:48,658 --> 00:41:51,726
you know, with the iPhone with the GPS...

633
00:41:52,258 --> 00:41:54,256
pin in every photograph,
so you know exactly...

634
00:41:54,281 --> 00:41:57,779
where you were, you know where the...
what serial number the instrument is.

635
00:41:57,804 --> 00:42:00,758
It's all very, very rigorously established...

636
00:42:00,883 --> 00:42:03,647
so that anybody sending their auditor...

637
00:42:03,672 --> 00:42:06,475
from a bank for a loan for half
a billion dollars is gonna...

638
00:42:06,500 --> 00:42:08,219
They have proof.
They have proof...

639
00:42:08,244 --> 00:42:10,218
of how that we,
at least we went through this...

640
00:42:10,219 --> 00:42:14,320
process in a rigorous and thorough manner.
Documented everything...

641
00:42:18,024 --> 00:42:20,358
So what happened?
Did you wanna get divorced?

642
00:42:20,383 --> 00:42:22,228
Or... was it a mutual?
- No, I didn't.

643
00:42:22,253 --> 00:42:24,798
No?
No, it was a big disappointment.

644
00:42:25,188 --> 00:42:27,165
I'm sorry.
- Yeah, I know.

645
00:42:27,352 --> 00:42:28,868
My wife just...

646
00:42:29,196 --> 00:42:31,071
you know, suddenly...

647
00:42:31,243 --> 00:42:33,251
suddenly kind of flaked. I don't know.

648
00:42:33,276 --> 00:42:34,526
She...

649
00:42:34,814 --> 00:42:36,064
just...

650
00:42:36,450 --> 00:42:39,141
had a better idea and left.

651
00:42:40,727 --> 00:42:44,579
And actually had an
alternative to me in mind...

652
00:42:45,258 --> 00:42:48,040
you know, back east.
- Okay.

653
00:42:48,627 --> 00:42:49,981
That happens.

654
00:42:50,814 --> 00:42:52,115
Apparently.

655
00:42:52,832 --> 00:42:54,176
Apparently.

656
00:42:54,692 --> 00:42:56,989
But you were together how many years?

657
00:42:57,286 --> 00:42:59,715
At the time of the divorce
it was 32 years.

658
00:42:59,740 --> 00:43:01,669
Wow.
- Yeah.

659
00:43:02,865 --> 00:43:04,120
It was really pretty awful.

660
00:43:04,145 --> 00:43:06,362
Do you think you would
wanna get married again?

661
00:43:06,387 --> 00:43:08,692
Not soon. Not today.

662
00:43:08,717 --> 00:43:11,169
I'm not asking.
- No, okay. Well, you know...

663
00:43:11,194 --> 00:43:13,886
what's happened in the course of my...

664
00:43:13,911 --> 00:43:17,809
so-called recovery is that I have...

665
00:43:19,054 --> 00:43:20,919
started to look at women...

666
00:43:21,061 --> 00:43:25,028
and then say, do I wanna,
is that something I wanna...

667
00:43:25,317 --> 00:43:28,067
you know, very nice,
very attractive, do I wanna...

668
00:43:28,231 --> 00:43:31,331
interrupt my current... solitude!
- Yeah.

669
00:43:31,356 --> 00:43:32,997
My lovely...

670
00:43:33,022 --> 00:43:35,901
how is this gonna fit into my lovely life?

671
00:43:35,926 --> 00:43:37,262
Exactly, which I'm now creating.

672
00:43:37,287 --> 00:43:39,208
Which I'm really enjoying.
- Right. Exactly.

673
00:43:39,233 --> 00:43:40,901
I know... I know.

674
00:43:40,926 --> 00:43:42,598
Do I have to come, have to...

675
00:43:42,733 --> 00:43:46,083
come, have to hang out
with this person all the time?

676
00:43:53,143 --> 00:43:54,751
She's really pregnant.
- Yeah.

677
00:43:54,752 --> 00:43:57,213
Was this a while ago?
- Yeah.

678
00:43:57,768 --> 00:43:59,001
And so did she have this baby?

679
00:43:59,026 --> 00:44:01,322
Yeah, she's actually had
another baby since then.

680
00:44:01,455 --> 00:44:04,455
But I didn't take a picture
of that pregnancy.

681
00:44:05,072 --> 00:44:07,094
Have you ever been pregnant?
- Never.

682
00:44:07,119 --> 00:44:09,151
Not once?
- Not that I know of, no.

683
00:44:09,822 --> 00:44:11,549
Have you?
No.

684
00:44:18,038 --> 00:44:19,492
What...

685
00:44:23,026 --> 00:44:24,273
What?

686
00:44:31,070 --> 00:44:34,117
When I was playing a doctor once,
I went and watched...

687
00:44:34,234 --> 00:44:37,305
babies being born... for real.

688
00:44:37,507 --> 00:44:40,109
Like... and I've thought the women, I think...

689
00:44:40,134 --> 00:44:41,516
because they gave me scrubs...

690
00:44:41,541 --> 00:44:44,373
and I think the women just thought
I was an intern or a doctor.

691
00:44:44,398 --> 00:44:46,651
Really?
Who let you in, like, the hospital?

692
00:44:46,676 --> 00:44:48,245
The hospital let me in.

693
00:44:48,270 --> 00:44:51,034
Because, you know, you say
blah, blah, blah...

694
00:44:51,330 --> 00:44:53,688
the studio, whatever, was blah, blah.

695
00:44:53,713 --> 00:44:57,479
And they're like:
Oh, okay, sure, you can go.

696
00:44:58,151 --> 00:45:00,752
Go, you know, the fourth floor.
Here's the pass.

697
00:45:00,885 --> 00:45:03,143
You know, you sign something or whatever.

698
00:45:03,291 --> 00:45:05,938
I remember one of the doctors
was delivering a baby...

699
00:45:05,963 --> 00:45:08,509
and he had his hand inside this woman...

700
00:45:08,534 --> 00:45:12,432
and he was watching a baseball,
like, a basketball game.

701
00:45:12,916 --> 00:45:15,142
While he was...
- Yeah, it's that...

702
00:45:15,369 --> 00:45:19,763
you know, he just does it all the time
so he's sort of like, okay.

703
00:45:20,361 --> 00:45:22,594
Was she like conscious?
- Yeah, giving birth.

704
00:45:22,619 --> 00:45:23,674
Yeah, she was conscious.

705
00:45:23,705 --> 00:45:26,282
And she wasn't like: Turn off the TV
while I'm giving birth.

706
00:45:26,307 --> 00:45:27,557
No.

707
00:45:31,179 --> 00:45:32,304
What?

708
00:45:32,445 --> 00:45:34,124
Oh, I thought we were gonna kiss.

709
00:45:34,249 --> 00:45:36,820
Do you... you should do it then.
- Oh, really?

710
00:45:37,046 --> 00:45:38,889
'Cause you kinda,
I thought we were too...

711
00:45:38,914 --> 00:45:40,515
but then I thought, he doesn't want to.

712
00:45:40,540 --> 00:45:43,265
No, It was mentally, you said 'what'
and I went...

713
00:45:43,850 --> 00:45:46,133
Should I just be very still and quiet?

714
00:45:46,226 --> 00:45:49,248
Okay, what if I just, I'm gonna sit here.
- Yeah.

715
00:45:49,273 --> 00:45:51,687
And then you just do what you wanna do.
- Okay.

716
00:45:51,712 --> 00:45:53,600
'Cause then I'll know
it's what you wanna do.

717
00:45:53,633 --> 00:45:57,062
'Cause I can't stand it.
I'm so tired of the guessing.

718
00:45:57,174 --> 00:45:58,554
Oh, okay.

719
00:46:00,983 --> 00:46:02,827
You're tired of the guessing?

720
00:46:02,852 --> 00:46:05,270
I can't... yeah,
I can't tell what you want?

721
00:46:05,597 --> 00:46:07,983
Really?
- I really can't.

722
00:46:11,988 --> 00:46:16,245
Okay, yeah, I said I wasn't gonna do
anything but that's really nice.

723
00:46:21,519 --> 00:46:23,038
No, they're just too tight.

724
00:46:23,063 --> 00:46:24,998
I'm not taking them off.

725
00:46:25,375 --> 00:46:26,838
That's like whoop.

726
00:46:27,850 --> 00:46:30,167
Oh really?
Yeah, a speed bump.

727
00:46:37,780 --> 00:46:38,971
What?

728
00:46:40,034 --> 00:46:42,948
I feel like I'm on a ride
at a theme park;

729
00:46:43,914 --> 00:46:45,393
this is like a seat belt.

730
00:46:45,611 --> 00:46:53,610
<i>Unintelligible mumble.</i>

731
00:46:59,433 --> 00:47:02,113
Yeah. No, I'm the camera.
- Yeah.

732
00:49:10,727 --> 00:49:13,078
Sorry, I can't find my car key.

733
00:49:13,223 --> 00:49:15,204
It must be just right...

734
00:49:15,470 --> 00:49:17,011
Right around here maybe.

735
00:49:26,266 --> 00:49:28,932
You know, I think it's in the bedroom.

736
00:49:42,367 --> 00:49:43,632
Oh my god.

737
00:49:44,117 --> 00:49:45,367
Okay.

738
00:49:45,679 --> 00:49:46,929
Sorry.

739
00:49:47,351 --> 00:49:52,492
Oh my God. I looked through this entire bag.
I'm so sorry.

740
00:49:53,145 --> 00:49:54,382
Okay.

741
00:51:34,804 --> 00:51:36,572
You all right?

742
00:51:52,070 --> 00:51:54,281
Do you put the ice in first, then?

743
00:51:54,617 --> 00:51:58,929
Not yet. I'm gonna start it
and then get it going.

744
00:52:01,783 --> 00:52:03,213
All right.

745
00:52:03,877 --> 00:52:06,932
Folks, it's show time.

746
00:52:07,682 --> 00:52:09,830
You gonna put in the ice?

747
00:52:10,377 --> 00:52:12,666
Not yet. I'm gonna do it... later.
Or that's later?

748
00:52:12,691 --> 00:52:14,877
Alright. Ready?
- So this is you...

749
00:52:46,648 --> 00:52:48,867
So you liked him?
- You thought he was okay.

750
00:52:48,892 --> 00:52:50,828
I really like him.
- He's fun.

751
00:52:51,148 --> 00:52:52,999
Yeah, he's really nice.

752
00:52:53,253 --> 00:52:55,007
He seems tender.

753
00:52:56,876 --> 00:52:58,546
I don't know.

754
00:53:03,058 --> 00:53:06,251
Seems like he really cares about you.

755
00:53:09,712 --> 00:53:11,188
Until he tried it.

756
00:53:11,296 --> 00:53:14,133
Are you trying to set us up?
- No.

757
00:53:14,158 --> 00:53:16,093
He's really...
He's just a friend.

758
00:53:16,618 --> 00:53:20,524
He's just a friend.
He dates lots of young women...

759
00:53:21,442 --> 00:53:23,454
like your age.
- Really?

760
00:53:24,102 --> 00:53:25,516
I think that's lame.
- No.

761
00:53:25,675 --> 00:53:28,751
Oh, I don't know.
It's just... it's biology.

762
00:53:30,269 --> 00:53:32,082
He's still got a...

763
00:53:32,792 --> 00:53:36,862
I don't know, I almost...
he's still got a sack full of nuts.

764
00:53:38,068 --> 00:53:40,011
But that makes no sense.

765
00:53:40,776 --> 00:53:42,423
That he's got...

766
00:53:42,735 --> 00:53:46,017
That he... he's...
- A sack of nuts.

767
00:53:46,374 --> 00:53:47,374
Still.

768
00:53:47,399 --> 00:53:49,600
Right?
- I guess. Cute.

769
00:53:49,725 --> 00:53:51,170
And so then...

770
00:53:51,756 --> 00:53:53,998
you know, we'll be together and a...

771
00:53:54,139 --> 00:53:56,827
young woman will walk through the room and...

772
00:53:56,953 --> 00:54:01,975
he... you know, you just see,
just biologically, he's like...

773
00:54:02,209 --> 00:54:04,733
His brain's going wha-a-a.

774
00:54:05,225 --> 00:54:07,030
I could pollinate that.

775
00:54:07,202 --> 00:54:10,217
And I can't, you know,
I can't get upset about that.

776
00:54:10,459 --> 00:54:12,600
I get upset about that stuff.

777
00:54:13,264 --> 00:54:14,466
Really?
- It really scares me.

778
00:54:14,491 --> 00:54:16,787
Yeah, it scares me to think...

779
00:54:18,588 --> 00:54:21,272
about being in a position where, like...

780
00:54:21,983 --> 00:54:23,889
I'm not the young one anymore.

781
00:54:24,014 --> 00:54:27,425
'Cause I feel like my whole life,
I've always been...

782
00:54:27,818 --> 00:54:31,357
like, the young person, like the young
person who was precocious...

783
00:54:31,366 --> 00:54:33,592
and part of... but I think...
- Yeah.

784
00:54:33,617 --> 00:54:35,630
You were the young person who was advanced.

785
00:54:35,655 --> 00:54:36,936
Right.
Hanging out with...

786
00:54:36,944 --> 00:54:38,411
Yeah, older people.
- older people.

787
00:54:38,535 --> 00:54:40,302
Right.
- And then suddenly you're...

788
00:54:40,327 --> 00:54:42,356
Yeah, now like everyone's
sort of caught up to me...

789
00:54:42,381 --> 00:54:44,677
I feel completely like, a duh.

790
00:54:44,702 --> 00:54:48,209
I'm just so afraid for like,
and also I feel like I used...

791
00:54:48,428 --> 00:54:51,052
being young and as like
a way of getting things.

792
00:54:51,077 --> 00:54:52,764
It's power.
- Right.

793
00:54:52,789 --> 00:54:53,967
It's power, right?
- People will do anything.

794
00:54:53,992 --> 00:54:55,567
So then you feel your power...

795
00:54:55,592 --> 00:54:58,131
kind of being drained away.
- Yeah.

796
00:54:58,156 --> 00:54:59,919
When I started to realize that...

797
00:54:59,944 --> 00:55:02,770
if I walked into a room
men weren't looking at me...

798
00:55:02,795 --> 00:55:04,492
that they were looking at younger women...

799
00:55:04,493 --> 00:55:07,069
you know, that something had passed me by.

800
00:55:07,282 --> 00:55:11,157
I became really depressed about it
and then that's when I started...

801
00:55:11,258 --> 00:55:13,610
I was just stoned all the time.

802
00:55:13,913 --> 00:55:17,476
I would just... I thought
I could escape it somehow.

803
00:55:17,914 --> 00:55:21,539
But really, it just narrowed
my options really.

804
00:55:22,289 --> 00:55:24,025
So that's why I'm interested, you know...

805
00:55:24,050 --> 00:55:27,806
because you have all of these,
you can do anything you want.

806
00:55:27,962 --> 00:55:31,417
And it's very powerful. You can do...
- Yeah.

807
00:55:31,736 --> 00:55:34,687
I mean, I think... that, you know,
there're all those different roles.

808
00:55:34,712 --> 00:55:37,312
Like, if you get married
and you become a mother,

809
00:55:37,337 --> 00:55:41,057
then you're... that's your role.

810
00:55:41,058 --> 00:55:43,017
Yeah, I've talked to a lot of people...

811
00:55:43,126 --> 00:55:45,789
men, whose wives were actresses
who stopped...

812
00:55:45,814 --> 00:55:48,585
acting completely once they had kids.

813
00:55:48,610 --> 00:55:50,672
They were just like: 'I don't wanna
deal with this bullshit anymore.

814
00:55:50,697 --> 00:55:52,829
Right, I'm done.
This is now my new life.'

815
00:55:52,953 --> 00:55:54,133
Right.

816
00:55:54,321 --> 00:55:58,241
Which, if it's so easy
to just stop doing it...

817
00:55:58,266 --> 00:56:00,297
I mean, why am I even getting...

818
00:56:00,438 --> 00:56:02,742
Right. But do you think
it would be easy for you?

819
00:56:02,875 --> 00:56:05,844
Don't, don't, it doesn't matter
what other people do.

820
00:56:05,961 --> 00:56:07,508
I just wonder what...

821
00:56:07,625 --> 00:56:08,905
If it would be easy for me...
- Yeah.

822
00:56:08,930 --> 00:56:10,742
What you think it would be easy for...

823
00:56:10,767 --> 00:56:14,172
if you do think it would be easy
for you to stop acting...

824
00:56:14,438 --> 00:56:16,457
and stay home with a baby all the time?

825
00:56:16,458 --> 00:56:18,891
I think it would because if...

826
00:56:20,155 --> 00:56:22,414
I don't know, realistically, but...

827
00:56:22,439 --> 00:56:25,610
part of me thinks it would because
so much of...

828
00:56:26,906 --> 00:56:29,686
it is about attention,
getting attention...

829
00:56:29,711 --> 00:56:31,633
and if you have a kid, that kid is just...

830
00:56:31,658 --> 00:56:33,086
paying attention...
- And it needs you.

831
00:56:33,111 --> 00:56:35,117
And it needs you so much more
than like...

832
00:56:35,142 --> 00:56:37,586
the movie business needs me.
- Right.

833
00:56:38,156 --> 00:56:39,827
I don't know.
- I always feel, like...

834
00:56:39,852 --> 00:56:43,789
what was a little bit weird for me,
a little...

835
00:56:45,922 --> 00:56:49,438
a sort of tragedy, is that I always
wanted to...

836
00:56:49,463 --> 00:56:52,061
you know, you knew.
I always was way into...

837
00:56:52,086 --> 00:56:55,352
being with the kids
and playing with the kids.

838
00:56:55,781 --> 00:56:57,530
I always thought I would have kids.

839
00:56:57,555 --> 00:56:58,874
Didn't you think that I would?
- Yeah.

840
00:56:58,899 --> 00:56:59,920
Right?

841
00:56:59,945 --> 00:57:03,695
So, I always thought that
that was just gonna happen.

842
00:57:05,320 --> 00:57:09,000
I just never met a man I thought
would be a good father.

843
00:57:10,610 --> 00:57:12,992
That I could really rely on.
- Right.

844
00:57:13,188 --> 00:57:16,083
But that might have been
my skewed perception because of...

845
00:57:16,208 --> 00:57:20,505
you know, grandpa and your grandfather
and all of that, like...

846
00:57:22,294 --> 00:57:24,964
It's a little different than Brooklyn, right?
- Sorry?

847
00:57:24,989 --> 00:57:27,839
It's a little different from Brooklyn.
- Yeah, it's pretty different.

848
00:57:27,864 --> 00:57:28,997
Yeah.

849
00:57:29,982 --> 00:57:32,653
It's something... it's great.

850
00:57:34,388 --> 00:57:36,949
And then one day all these houses
are gonna be gone.

851
00:57:37,114 --> 00:57:38,622
I mean, the...

852
00:57:39,653 --> 00:57:41,130
sea level here is...

853
00:57:42,146 --> 00:57:44,036
it's getting higher every year.

854
00:57:44,349 --> 00:57:45,866
All these...

855
00:57:46,437 --> 00:57:49,333
you know, we talk about
castles right in the sand.

856
00:57:49,358 --> 00:57:53,515
Yeah, I can't imagine, I mean,
I can't imagine living here.

857
00:57:53,624 --> 00:57:55,927
I'd be scared that I'd fall
into the water or something.

858
00:57:55,952 --> 00:57:59,660
Yeah, it's great for the moment
but... it's just...

859
00:58:00,222 --> 00:58:02,799
it's funny to think these people
bought their dream houses.

860
00:58:02,824 --> 00:58:06,422
They thought they were, you know,
putting their nugget away.

861
00:58:06,423 --> 00:58:08,822
Yeah.
- And, I mean, look at these pylons.

862
00:58:08,847 --> 00:58:10,902
This is all gonna erode.

863
00:58:11,300 --> 00:58:13,722
It's just part of the folly of it all.

864
00:58:13,957 --> 00:58:16,082
But you know, I got my place...

865
00:58:16,645 --> 00:58:18,175
five years ago.

866
00:58:19,222 --> 00:58:21,213
And the tide was just...
- Do you regret it?

867
00:58:21,238 --> 00:58:23,691
No. No, every day is...

868
00:58:24,457 --> 00:58:26,308
fucking awesome.

869
00:58:27,246 --> 00:58:30,488
But if you were thinking
you were cashing in...

870
00:58:30,738 --> 00:58:32,519
you gonna have to think it again.
All this...

871
00:58:32,544 --> 00:58:35,918
will be gone in, I don't know, 10 years.

872
00:58:37,754 --> 00:58:39,587
That doesn't scare you?

873
00:58:40,285 --> 00:58:42,113
No, I'll just move somewhere else.

874
00:58:42,261 --> 00:58:47,084
I'm already, you know,
I'm done with... fretting over it.

875
00:58:48,014 --> 00:58:49,608
I've spent a lot of time...

876
00:58:49,967 --> 00:58:52,491
trying to change people's minds
and it just doesn't work.

877
00:58:52,516 --> 00:58:54,459
So now I'm just gonna enjoy the ride...

878
00:58:54,484 --> 00:58:58,045
from each beautiful place
and watch it crumble away.

879
00:59:00,061 --> 00:59:01,506
But look at this, you know.

880
00:59:01,507 --> 00:59:05,077
You just live in the moment.
It's spectacular.

881
00:59:33,221 --> 00:59:35,738
Well, I'm gonna take a cab home, okay?

882
00:59:36,627 --> 00:59:38,573
No, I want to come get you.
I'm gonna come get you.

883
00:59:38,978 --> 00:59:41,235
I know, but last time you did that
you were really grouchy...

884
00:59:41,260 --> 00:59:44,533
and you said you resented me
for making you... pick me up.

885
00:59:45,189 --> 00:59:46,439
Well...

886
00:59:46,681 --> 00:59:49,353
that was a weird... that was...
that was a weird night.

887
00:59:49,900 --> 00:59:51,735
Now, this one's gonna be
a very normal one.

888
00:59:51,760 --> 00:59:53,525
I'm just gonna come get you
and be really happy...

889
00:59:53,550 --> 00:59:55,789
and we're gonna make out in the car,
etcetera.

890
00:59:55,814 --> 00:59:58,079
Cool. I can't wait. I really miss you.

891
00:59:58,213 --> 01:00:00,274
I miss you too.
- I really love you.

892
01:00:00,478 --> 01:00:02,604
I love you.
- I can't wait to hold you.

893
01:00:03,009 --> 01:00:05,298
I'm gonna kiss you as soon as possible.

894
01:00:05,587 --> 01:00:07,923
Yeah, it'll be really soon.

895
01:00:08,782 --> 01:00:11,556
All right, love you.
- I love you too.

896
01:00:11,753 --> 01:00:13,021
Bye.

897
01:00:30,871 --> 01:00:32,512
Thank you so much.

898
01:00:32,880 --> 01:00:35,208
No, thank you.
I'm so glad you came.

899
01:00:35,233 --> 01:00:36,199
Me too.
- All right.

900
01:00:36,224 --> 01:00:39,177
Come on. I don't want you to be late.

901
01:00:42,060 --> 01:00:44,067
Alright, now, I want you to be really...

902
01:00:44,092 --> 01:00:46,152
really careful going out of here.

903
01:00:46,177 --> 01:00:47,380
Okay.

904
01:00:48,903 --> 01:00:51,247
Say a little prayer.

905
01:00:51,591 --> 01:00:54,333
Really. Just start...
say a little prayer.

906
01:00:54,961 --> 01:00:56,239
Okay.

907
01:00:56,489 --> 01:00:57,712
Okay.
- I love you.

908
01:00:57,852 --> 01:01:00,146
I love you too, give me a kiss.

909
01:01:01,749 --> 01:01:03,457
Thank you again.
- I'll see you.

910
01:01:03,482 --> 01:01:05,902
Call in and text me
when you get to the other side.

911
01:01:05,927 --> 01:01:07,972
Okay.
- Okay, just to let me know you're okay.

912
01:01:07,997 --> 01:01:09,544
Be very careful.

913
01:01:09,708 --> 01:01:12,286
All right?
Look at those waves.

914
01:02:03,465 --> 01:02:05,806
We should offer this as a service.

915
01:02:08,643 --> 01:02:12,181
We could go down like Venice Beach.
- Leave it... it's off.

916
01:02:13,201 --> 01:02:14,711
Under there.
- Did I get it?

917
01:02:14,736 --> 01:02:17,912
You, you, all right. Now, when I'm up here,
you go under.

918
01:02:17,937 --> 01:02:19,187
Okay.

919
01:02:21,441 --> 01:02:24,506
Good. We're gonna go through the center.

920
01:02:27,123 --> 01:02:28,927
My God, I almost...

921
01:02:29,552 --> 01:02:30,793
Okay.
- Okay.

922
01:02:30,818 --> 01:02:32,168
Good, good.

923
01:02:33,945 --> 01:02:35,435
It's done.

924
01:02:36,926 --> 01:02:38,226
Awesome.

925
01:02:39,381 --> 01:02:41,881
And the cord. I get the cord, alright?

926
01:02:42,409 --> 01:02:44,615
And then it does this thing.

927
01:02:47,757 --> 01:02:49,343
It's better.
- Sweet.

928
01:02:49,368 --> 01:02:50,902
It's much better.

929
01:02:55,049 --> 01:02:57,986
There's a green bean by your foot.

930
01:03:02,375 --> 01:03:04,774
Just... just dropped it.

931
01:03:11,551 --> 01:03:13,050
Good stuff.

932
01:03:26,448 --> 01:03:28,080
You got anything else?

933
01:03:30,257 --> 01:03:31,580
I'm all done.

934
01:03:52,422 --> 01:03:53,893
Oh yeah.

935
01:03:54,846 --> 01:03:56,346
What a night.

936
01:04:06,608 --> 01:04:08,380
What's going on up there?

937
01:04:09,465 --> 01:04:11,621
I don't know.
I mean, there's...

938
01:04:11,646 --> 01:04:13,418
for the longest...
I don't know...

939
01:04:13,443 --> 01:04:18,279
I lived here almost a whole year
and no sound, no parties.

940
01:04:18,411 --> 01:04:19,944
No, I've never heard, I never heard.

941
01:04:19,969 --> 01:04:22,062
But, it's just like...

942
01:04:22,717 --> 01:04:26,529
They're kids. I think they
just graduated from something.

943
01:04:26,748 --> 01:04:28,248
They're young.

944
01:04:33,010 --> 01:04:34,625
To youths.

945
01:04:37,776 --> 01:04:39,553
Can you do Jack?

946
01:04:41,328 --> 01:04:42,396
Please.

947
01:04:42,421 --> 01:04:44,182
Jack finishing dinner?

948
01:04:45,275 --> 01:04:45,908
Yeah.

949
01:04:45,933 --> 01:04:49,478
Just ask me about the kids again,
as Jack.

950
01:04:50,391 --> 01:04:53,978
How about those goddamn
kids upstairs, huh?

951
01:04:54,228 --> 01:04:56,212
It's enough to drive you crazy.

952
01:04:56,384 --> 01:04:58,306
You know what I mean?

953
01:05:03,642 --> 01:05:04,853
Again.

954
01:05:04,970 --> 01:05:06,595
No, that's enough.

955
01:05:06,931 --> 01:05:09,876
No, I can never have enough Jack.

956
01:05:12,744 --> 01:05:14,790
Oh, Rusty, come on.

957
01:05:15,947 --> 01:05:18,072
Do some Jack for me.

958
01:05:19,197 --> 01:05:20,798
Come on.

959
01:05:23,204 --> 01:05:25,254
So Jack...

960
01:05:25,527 --> 01:05:28,079
did you think the fish was underdone?

961
01:05:28,204 --> 01:05:31,071
No, I thought the fish was perfect.

962
01:05:31,243 --> 01:05:34,094
Stop worrying about it.
Know what I mean?

963
01:05:34,297 --> 01:05:36,097
The fish was perfect.

964
01:05:36,696 --> 01:05:38,141
All righty, Ann?

965
01:05:38,274 --> 01:05:40,313
All right, Rusty.

966
01:05:45,371 --> 01:05:48,708
Did you just pat me?
- I did, I like this.

967
01:05:48,958 --> 01:05:51,095
I like your shawl.

968
01:05:51,230 --> 01:05:53,325
He's patting me.
- Look at you in your shawl.

969
01:05:53,350 --> 01:05:55,198
Your little granny shawl.

970
01:05:57,409 --> 01:05:58,706
It's cute.

971
01:05:59,917 --> 01:06:01,736
All right.
You know what you just did?

972
01:06:01,761 --> 01:06:04,791
You patted me,
then you called me a granny...

973
01:06:04,816 --> 01:06:08,253
and then you called me cute.
- That's not so bad.

974
01:06:12,719 --> 01:06:13,973
What?

975
01:06:23,599 --> 01:06:24,948
Don't look, why...

976
01:06:24,973 --> 01:06:27,184
And then you look at me like that.

977
01:06:27,442 --> 01:06:29,036
Fuck you.

978
01:06:29,340 --> 01:06:30,790
Really.

979
01:06:32,200 --> 01:06:33,931
Em, chill.

980
01:06:37,368 --> 01:06:38,860
You're too...

981
01:06:41,477 --> 01:06:43,306
You know, you've been on this...

982
01:06:43,470 --> 01:06:45,202
Just...
- tear!

983
01:06:45,227 --> 01:06:46,872
You've been on a tear.

984
01:06:47,787 --> 01:06:48,942
A what?

985
01:06:49,091 --> 01:06:50,300
A tear?

986
01:06:50,325 --> 01:06:53,950
You're on a tear.
A pity party tear.

987
01:06:56,505 --> 01:06:59,039
Come on.
- You don't understand nothing.

988
01:06:59,380 --> 01:07:01,263
Oh, maybe not.

989
01:07:02,646 --> 01:07:05,979
I just think you're
spending a lot of time...

990
01:07:06,263 --> 01:07:08,511
I mean, tell me what it is.

991
01:07:08,536 --> 01:07:10,558
Wha... are you... are you...

992
01:07:13,238 --> 01:07:14,949
having a crisis?

993
01:07:18,277 --> 01:07:20,425
Am I having a crisis?

994
01:07:23,918 --> 01:07:25,886
I think you're projecting.

995
01:07:28,964 --> 01:07:30,648
I'm doing fine.

996
01:07:33,113 --> 01:07:34,847
So am I.
- Okay.

997
01:07:34,995 --> 01:07:36,111
Well, you're just being sensitive.

998
01:07:36,136 --> 01:07:38,892
That's the only way I'm bringing it up.
I'm not trying to...

999
01:07:38,917 --> 01:07:41,558
come at you. You're just being so sensitive.

1000
01:07:42,074 --> 01:07:43,353
With the granny stuff.

1001
01:07:43,378 --> 01:07:47,268
This is... This is a...
what should I say about this...

1002
01:07:48,940 --> 01:07:50,870
a beautiful lace thing?

1003
01:07:52,870 --> 01:07:53,954
What do you wanna say?

1004
01:07:53,955 --> 01:07:55,380
I think it's pretty.
It's nice.

1005
01:07:55,405 --> 01:07:57,306
That's nice.
- Okay.

1006
01:07:58,284 --> 01:08:00,073
What else do you like?

1007
01:08:05,706 --> 01:08:08,542
I like being here with you.
You know that.

1008
01:08:08,847 --> 01:08:11,353
Yeah, you're comf... I'm comfortable.
- Yeah.

1009
01:08:11,378 --> 01:08:13,245
Yeah, I don't think
we should fuck with that.

1010
01:08:13,270 --> 01:08:14,401
I agree.

1011
01:08:14,495 --> 01:08:16,720
I only hope you didn't think
I thought we should...

1012
01:08:16,753 --> 01:08:18,845
I hope just comfortable.
- Yeah.

1013
01:08:18,870 --> 01:08:20,987
We had a nice dinner.
- Yeah.

1014
01:08:21,012 --> 01:08:24,878
You know, I like it when we,
you know, I can...

1015
01:08:25,440 --> 01:08:27,642
laugh with you and... yeah.

1016
01:08:27,682 --> 01:08:30,136
So, when I say you're cute,
that's not that I'm...

1017
01:08:30,251 --> 01:08:31,738
You shouldn't feel threatened, like...
- I know, but it was...

1018
01:08:31,763 --> 01:08:34,325
like I'm saying...
- No it's, I wasn't threatened...

1019
01:08:34,350 --> 01:08:37,946
I was insulted. It's just the patting,
and the granny, and the cute.

1020
01:08:37,971 --> 01:08:39,921
It's just a little much.

1021
01:08:39,946 --> 01:08:41,577
That was a little...
Don't you think?

1022
01:08:41,602 --> 01:08:43,006
Come on?
- I mean, really.

1023
01:08:43,031 --> 01:08:44,819
What do you want?
- Like, we're great friends.

1024
01:08:44,844 --> 01:08:47,670
I don't want anything.
I like, I was enjoying...

1025
01:08:47,695 --> 01:08:50,734
What do you want? Petting? Not petting?

1026
01:08:51,281 --> 01:08:52,803
Are you flirting with me now?

1027
01:08:52,828 --> 01:08:55,726
No, I'm just trying to make things right.

1028
01:08:58,023 --> 01:08:59,383
They're right, they're fine.
- Good.

1029
01:08:59,408 --> 01:09:00,795
I think we have a good...

1030
01:09:00,820 --> 01:09:04,018
Don't you think we have a good arrangement?
- I do.

1031
01:09:11,054 --> 01:09:15,121
We can do that too.
Doesn't have to be a big deal, right?

1032
01:09:17,207 --> 01:09:18,832
Come on, Em.

1033
01:09:19,946 --> 01:09:22,659
Just a little.
- Rusty, I don't wanna...

1034
01:09:32,120 --> 01:09:34,813
See, I don't even know if I can pet you.

1035
01:09:35,019 --> 01:09:37,115
I just don't want you to feel bad.

1036
01:09:37,295 --> 01:09:38,870
You're drunk.

1037
01:09:39,839 --> 01:09:41,519
I'm not drunk.

1038
01:10:03,984 --> 01:10:06,328
I think you're very drunk.

1039
01:10:06,859 --> 01:10:08,800
No, I'm just...

1040
01:10:09,979 --> 01:10:11,487
just feeling good.

1041
01:10:12,948 --> 01:10:14,940
No, do Jack.

1042
01:10:15,120 --> 01:10:18,081
Tell me that you're feeling good.
Come on.

1043
01:10:18,253 --> 01:10:19,290
Tell me.

1044
01:10:19,315 --> 01:10:22,189
Will you have sex with me if I'm Jack?

1045
01:10:23,557 --> 01:10:27,877
I said, tell me that you're feeling good.

1046
01:10:28,417 --> 01:10:29,986
I'm feeling good.

1047
01:10:36,236 --> 01:10:37,674
Good.
- All right.

1048
01:10:37,836 --> 01:10:39,729
All right. So we...

1049
01:10:41,667 --> 01:10:43,565
okay.
- All right.

1050
01:10:44,190 --> 01:10:46,854
- So, not tomorrow? We're not going out?
No.

1051
01:10:47,003 --> 01:10:48,964
I'm going by myself.

1052
01:10:51,089 --> 01:10:53,674
Okay.
- But maybe later in the week?

1053
01:10:53,823 --> 01:10:54,964
Sure.

1054
01:10:55,112 --> 01:10:58,909
Just text me and I'll meet you out there.
- Okay.

1055
01:11:00,304 --> 01:11:02,077
Let's clean this up.

1056
01:11:02,235 --> 01:11:04,349
Okay. No, you clean.
- I've been cleaning up.

1057
01:11:04,374 --> 01:11:06,349
You clean it up because
I did most of the cooking.

1058
01:11:06,374 --> 01:11:07,888
You stay there.
- No, you know what?

1059
01:11:07,913 --> 01:11:10,300
Granny's just gonna curl up.

1060
01:11:12,555 --> 01:11:14,484
'Cause grannies get to just...

1061
01:11:14,593 --> 01:11:17,073
Look, old granny need another drinkie?
- Doctor I ain't sick...

1062
01:11:17,098 --> 01:11:18,549
Granny's cold.

1063
01:11:18,574 --> 01:11:20,012
Thank you.

1064
01:11:20,209 --> 01:11:21,243
Thanks.

1065
01:11:23,270 --> 01:11:24,882
Grandpa Jack.

1066
01:11:33,171 --> 01:11:35,073
There's a sense in which...

1067
01:11:35,677 --> 01:11:39,005
psychiatry and psychotherapy are becoming...

1068
01:11:39,030 --> 01:11:40,974
the religion of the west.

1069
01:11:43,341 --> 01:11:46,955
Psychoanalysis has much in common...

1070
01:11:47,239 --> 01:11:52,411
with the forms and procedures
of institutional religion.

1071
01:11:53,486 --> 01:11:56,535
There is, for example, apostolic succession...

1072
01:11:58,343 --> 01:12:01,442
the passing down of one of...

1073
01:12:20,939 --> 01:12:23,988
So, what's going on with the sun?

1074
01:12:25,694 --> 01:12:27,811
If somebody asks me that?

1075
01:12:28,537 --> 01:12:29,837
It's...

1076
01:12:30,571 --> 01:12:33,377
there. It's, you know, for, for...

1077
01:12:33,402 --> 01:12:36,005
for the foreseeable, useful...

1078
01:12:36,843 --> 01:12:38,143
future.

1079
01:12:38,383 --> 01:12:40,464
Ultimately, it goes away.

1080
01:12:41,050 --> 01:12:43,463
Not everything goes away.

1081
01:12:43,940 --> 01:12:46,026
But in the meantime, it's sitting there.
It's a...

1082
01:12:46,051 --> 01:12:49,286
a middle-aged star. And...

1083
01:12:50,911 --> 01:12:53,926
you know it's there and...

1084
01:12:55,594 --> 01:12:59,774
you know, available in various forms
for us to harvest...

1085
01:13:00,060 --> 01:13:02,060
energy we use from it.

1086
01:13:03,793 --> 01:13:05,036
Okay.

1087
01:13:05,669 --> 01:13:08,759
Wind is ultimately solar.

1088
01:13:13,562 --> 01:13:17,209
Wave power would be solar
because it's generated by winds.

1089
01:13:17,553 --> 01:13:22,007
You know, direct solar energy,
you know, photovoltaic or...

1090
01:13:23,605 --> 01:13:26,531
concentrated forms of solar energy,
those are all...

1091
01:13:26,757 --> 01:13:28,057
just...

1092
01:13:28,919 --> 01:13:31,660
energy harvested as it's produced.

1093
01:13:33,543 --> 01:13:36,332
Even ethanol, you know.
You grow plants.

1094
01:13:36,621 --> 01:13:40,591
You create a fuel, an alcohol, and...

1095
01:13:41,279 --> 01:13:44,963
that's also renewable, solar base, fuel.

1096
01:13:45,905 --> 01:13:49,692
The fossil fuels are also solar based.
They took, you know...

1097
01:13:49,864 --> 01:13:52,863
I don't know,
70-100 million years to make...

1098
01:13:53,195 --> 01:13:55,235
and they were stored...

1099
01:13:55,555 --> 01:13:58,204
you know, in the form of plant life.

1100
01:13:59,410 --> 01:14:00,660
And...

1101
01:14:02,032 --> 01:14:05,251
there's a lot of that stuff and we've been...

1102
01:14:05,863 --> 01:14:08,597
taking that large accumulation,
all that we had in the back...

1103
01:14:08,630 --> 01:14:13,696
and we've been...
burning it in a 100 years time.

1104
01:14:13,969 --> 01:14:18,694
So, what the earth was busy doing for...

1105
01:14:18,695 --> 01:14:20,364
a long, long, long, long time...

1106
01:14:20,389 --> 01:14:24,177
was going up very rapidly... in smoke.

1107
01:14:24,599 --> 01:14:26,395
So that seems to be something...

1108
01:14:26,420 --> 01:14:29,063
that you would think would
throw things out of balance.

1109
01:14:29,088 --> 01:14:34,126
So the whole renewable idea is one
of living within your means.

1110
01:14:36,527 --> 01:14:38,613
Using things as they come...

1111
01:14:40,355 --> 01:14:42,151
in a sustainable matter.

1112
01:14:42,753 --> 01:14:45,221
Until, of course, the sun goes away.

1113
01:14:49,005 --> 01:14:50,982
Is that what you meant?

1114
01:14:54,245 --> 01:14:56,127
I think so.

1115
01:14:58,678 --> 01:15:00,279
I forget.

1116
01:15:03,117 --> 01:15:07,620
I was gonna ask you something else
but I forgot what it was.

1117
01:15:09,493 --> 01:15:10,774
Well...
