It's good.

00:01:18,211 --> 00:01:19,077
Not great.

6
00:01:20,964 --> 00:01:24,516
But seeing that you are a
business man, Mr. Santiago.

7
00:01:24,584 --> 00:01:26,051
Captain.

00:01:26,919 --> 00:01:28,753
[Laughs] Captain.

9
00:01:29,806 --> 00:01:34,893
My associates and I are willing
to negotiate, a reasonable price.

10
00:01:35,261 --> 00:01:36,428
Let's say, 100,000.

12
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:46,038
One million for the entire take,

Not a penny less.

14
00:01:48,941 --> 00:01:52,961
A steep price for a small catch.

15
00:01:53,046 --> 00:01:58,500
A pod of 20,000 sharks are
migrating in this direction.

16
00:01:59,118 --> 00:02:00,669
When we're through with it,

17
00:02:02,005 --> 00:02:05,457
One million will look like a bargain.

18
00:02:09,262 --> 00:02:09,961
500.

19
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:21,806
If you're looking to negotiate, Mr.
Palmer, look for the insurance salesman.

20
00:02:24,277 --> 00:02:25,944
I do believe we have a deal.

I think this is for you captain.
The deposit.

You'll receive the rest when we dock.

You know the most important
thing I learned out here?

30
00:03:00,346 --> 00:03:02,814
We shouldn't be afraid of the sharks.

31
00:03:04,484 --> 00:03:07,986

They're called waves. They do
that from time to time.

00:03:33,396 --> 00:03:36,181
The storm is too strong. We are
going to have to go around it.

00:54:52,956 --> 00:54:54,523
We got to get there fast before
they clear the accident.

705
00:54:54,574 --> 00:54:55,407
What accident?

706
00:54:55,492 --> 00:54:56,709
Something I saw on the news

707
00:54:58,878 --> 00:54:59,545
Look out!

708
00:54:59,629 --> 00:55:01,130
Whoa!

709
00:55:03,416 --> 00:55:04,383
This is nuts.

710
00:55:08,672 --> 00:55:10,306
Now we're never gonna get to Van Nuys.

711
00:55:10,373 --> 00:55:13,142
- Baz, Drive around it.
- I can't. It's blocked in every direction.

712
00:55:17,847 --> 00:55:19,932
We got to get Matt before the
storm picks up again.

713
00:55:21,685 --> 00:55:22,685
I'm going for it.

714
00:55:23,353 --> 00:55:25,237
- Are you crazy! Don't do it
- Go! Go! Go!

715
00:55:25,322 --> 00:55:27,489
Whoo!

716
00:55:27,557 --> 00:55:29,325
[Sirens]

717
00:55:29,392 --> 00:55:30,659
[Police] Pull your car over.

718
00:55:31,578 --> 00:55:34,279
Dad! The police are chasing us.

719
00:55:34,531 --> 00:55:35,280
- Hey Baz.
- Yeah.

720
00:55:35,365 --> 00:55:37,566
Stop your vehicle now!

721
00:55:37,617 --> 00:55:39,001
Drive faster.

722
00:55:39,068 --> 00:55:40,369
No worries mate.

723
00:55:42,672 --> 00:55:43,422
Fast enough for ya?

724
00:55:43,506 --> 00:55:44,289
Yeah.

725
00:55:47,711 --> 00:55:49,178
[Police] Pull to the side of the road.

726
00:55:49,245 --> 00:55:55,134
[Sirens]

727
00:55:55,218 --> 00:55:56,685
[Police] Stop your vehicle now.

728
00:56:01,641 --> 00:56:03,475
Hey Baz, is that nitrous button?

729
00:56:03,560 --> 00:56:05,427
- It certainly is mate.
- What do yo say we hit that?

730
00:56:05,478 --> 00:56:07,196
- Give it a go.
- Hold on folks.

731
00:56:10,834 --> 00:56:15,037
[Sirens Continue]

732
00:56:15,104 --> 00:56:18,540
Hold on to your panties ladies.
[Fin Laughing]

733
00:56:23,946 --> 00:56:24,713
Oh man!

734
00:56:24,781 --> 00:56:27,466
Whoo! Now this is fun.

735
00:56:30,220 --> 00:56:31,453
I think we lost them.

736
00:56:33,723 --> 00:56:34,723
Now we're talking.

737
00:56:43,633 --> 00:56:44,316
Ok.

738
00:56:44,818 --> 00:56:46,268
It should be smooth sailing from here.

739
00:56:49,472 --> 00:56:51,824
Why is there a retirement home
next to an airport?

740
00:56:51,908 --> 00:56:54,026
Because old people can't hear.

741
00:57:30,447 --> 00:57:31,647
It doesn't look like they've left.

742
00:57:31,698 --> 00:57:33,198
Their cars are still here.

743
00:57:35,452 --> 00:57:36,852
I'm gonna go look upstairs.

744
00:57:36,903 --> 00:57:38,287
Ok. I'll check these rooms.

745
00:57:38,521 --> 00:57:39,187
Matt?

746
00:57:40,022 --> 00:57:40,656
Matt?

747
00:57:42,191 --> 00:57:43,242
Has anybody seen anything?

748
00:57:58,641 --> 00:57:59,258
Matt?

749
00:58:00,426 --> 00:58:01,643
Matt?

750
00:58:02,896 --> 00:58:09,935
[Wind]

751
00:58:13,940 --> 00:58:15,357
It's time to leave Kansas mate.

752
00:58:17,710 --> 00:58:18,827
There's no one up here.

753
00:58:19,529 --> 00:58:20,462
Where is everyone?

754
00:58:42,986 --> 00:58:44,653
Whoa Whoa Whoa Whoa!

755
00:58:44,720 --> 00:58:47,439
No no no. I'm looking for Matt.
Is there a Matt here?

756
00:58:47,524 --> 00:58:48,574
Matt?

757
00:58:48,658 --> 00:58:50,609
Uh, yeah yeah. I'm Matt. Who are
you?

758
00:58:50,693 --> 00:58:51,660
Guys I found Matt com on.

759
00:58:51,727 --> 00:58:53,245
Come here. He's in here.

760
00:58:54,330 --> 00:58:55,414
Matt!

761
00:58:55,498 --> 00:58:56,949
Dad? Mom?

762
00:58:57,033 --> 00:58:58,834
What are you guys doing here?

763
00:58:59,953 --> 00:59:01,903
We had to come inland to avoid the storm.

764
00:59:01,955 --> 00:59:03,905
- We came in to get you.
- There's sharks everywhere.

765
00:59:03,957 --> 00:59:05,173
Sharks?

766
00:59:05,241 --> 00:59:06,592
Is this the best shelter you got?

767
00:59:06,676 --> 00:59:08,544
Look, we don't exactly have a storm cellar.

768
00:59:08,595 --> 00:59:10,596
We better find something to
protect ourselves and quick.

769
00:59:10,680 --> 00:59:11,930
From what?

770
00:59:12,015 --> 00:59:13,482
They couldn't possibly make it
all the way out here.

771
00:59:13,550 --> 00:59:15,467
They can.

772
00:59:15,552 --> 00:59:16,935
It's entirely possible. A hurricane can
pick up marine life out of the ocean

773
00:59:17,020 --> 00:59:18,587
and drop it hundreds of miles away.

774
00:59:19,556 --> 00:59:21,590
Hold this.

775
00:59:21,658 --> 00:59:23,758
Yeah, he's right. It happened
once near Alice Springs. 100s of
perch fell from the sky.

776
00:59:23,810 --> 00:59:25,127
Why not Sharks?

777
00:59:25,761 --> 00:59:27,762
Look, what the hell is going on here?

778
00:59:27,814 --> 00:59:30,949
[Loud Bang]

779
00:59:31,034 --> 00:59:38,156
[Creaking]

780
00:59:38,241 --> 00:59:39,608
[Screaming]

781
00:59:39,659 --> 00:59:43,111
It's a Sharknado!

782
00:59:43,880 --> 00:59:46,048
Let's get inside here. Get in
get in.

783
01:00:45,642 --> 01:00:48,009
The news said that there is 3 tornadoes
in the area. We're not safe here.

784
01:00:48,061 --> 01:00:50,896
What's the fastest way to get out of here?

785
01:00:50,980 --> 01:00:52,347
Can that fly?

786
01:00:52,398 --> 01:00:59,571
I don't know. Let me check.

787
01:00:59,656 --> 01:01:01,790
Looks pretty beat up.

788
01:01:01,857 --> 01:01:04,626
Hey you know what? She'll fly.

789
01:01:04,694 --> 01:01:06,078
We're not all gonna fit in here.

790
01:01:06,162 --> 01:01:07,245
We can't fly in these storms.

791
01:01:07,330 --> 01:01:08,497
Then what are we gonna do?

792
01:01:08,548 --> 01:01:09,998
We're gonna stand and fight?

793
01:01:10,049 --> 01:01:14,202
We just wait and wait here for
sharks to rain down to us again.

794
01:01:14,253 --> 01:01:18,140
We need to arm ourselves with
something more powerful then these.

795
01:01:18,207 --> 01:01:20,342
What were you thinking?

796
01:01:20,410 --> 01:01:21,893
That store, It's got everything
we need.

797
01:01:23,179 --> 01:01:25,564
Sepra peratus.

798
01:01:25,648 --> 01:01:28,316
[Chuckles]

799
01:01:35,057 --> 01:01:36,074
They must have evacuated.

800
01:01:36,159 --> 01:01:38,527
How are we getting in?

801
01:01:40,747 --> 01:01:42,897
Guys stand back. I have the key.

802
01:01:43,533 --> 01:01:44,900
[Gun Shot]

803
01:01:48,121 --> 01:01:49,371
Dad, I'll be right back.

804
01:01:50,123 --> 01:01:51,707
I have an idea. Come with me.

805
01:02:04,787 --> 01:02:05,787
[Chuckles]

806
01:02:07,807 --> 01:02:10,108
Oh nice! This is what I'm talking about.

807
01:02:15,314 --> 01:02:19,117
[Talking Under Breath]

808
01:02:21,821 --> 01:02:23,789
Hey, do you think you can make
this work?

809
01:02:23,873 --> 01:02:24,990
Yeah. I'll make it work.

810
01:02:25,074 --> 01:02:25,824
Good.

811
01:02:26,209 --> 01:02:26,875
Bombs.

812
01:02:26,942 --> 01:02:33,465
Bombs?

813
01:02:33,549 --> 01:02:37,385
Instead of letting live sharks rain down on
people, we are going to get in that chopper

814
01:02:37,453 --> 01:02:41,173
and throw bombs into the tornadoes.
Blasting those bastards to bits.

815
01:02:43,760 --> 01:02:47,012
I like it, but how is that gonna
stop a tornado?

816
01:02:47,847 --> 01:02:50,265
Tornadoes happen when cold and
warm air meet.

817
01:02:52,935 --> 01:02:56,738
Now if you drop a bomb head, right in the
middle of it, You might just equalize it.

818
01:02:59,408 --> 01:03:02,444
But if you miss, we're screwed.

819
01:03:03,379 --> 01:03:06,615
Oh, hell no. You got a death
wish? No way!

820
01:03:06,666 --> 01:03:08,700
Dad, I'm the only one that could do it.

821
01:03:08,785 --> 01:03:10,985
Bobby and Noellen haven't even solo yet.

822
01:03:11,537 --> 01:03:13,421
What's wrong?

823
01:03:13,489 --> 01:03:16,508
Your son wants to go into a helicopter
and drop a bomb into the tornado.

824
01:03:16,926 --> 01:03:18,293
No! It's too dangerous.

825
01:03:18,344 --> 01:03:20,212
I'll watch his back. I'll be his
bombardier.

826
01:03:20,296 --> 01:03:21,713
Then definitely not.

827
01:03:21,798 --> 01:03:24,683
Dad, we have a chance to save
thousands of lives. Maybe more.

828
01:03:24,767 --> 01:03:27,686
You always taught me to help
others. I'm going.

829
01:03:27,770 --> 01:03:31,072
He's right April. We'll work it out together.
I won't let anything happen to him.

830
01:03:31,140 --> 01:03:32,274
Don't you understand you can die Matt?

831
01:03:32,341 --> 01:03:33,341
Mom, we don't have any other option.

832
01:03:33,392 --> 01:03:35,277
And you are not gonna stop me.

833
01:03:36,312 --> 01:03:37,846
He certainly is your son.

834
01:03:40,817 --> 01:03:41,783
Shopping cart?

835
01:03:41,851 --> 01:03:42,784
Yeah.

836
01:03:48,124 --> 01:03:48,907
Claud?

837
01:03:49,692 --> 01:03:50,375
Claud?

838
01:03:53,296 --> 01:03:55,997
Hey! Come on. What are you doing
down here? What's the problem?

839
01:03:59,201 --> 01:04:00,535
You.

840
01:04:01,203 --> 01:04:02,470
Your my problem.

841
01:04:02,722 --> 01:04:04,840
Are we really gonna do that now?
Now?

842
01:04:09,929 --> 01:04:12,046
Look, what are you and mom doing?

843
01:04:12,098 --> 01:04:15,817
You guys can barely stand to be in a
room together for 5 minutes, and now

844
01:04:15,885 --> 01:04:20,071
What? Cause you are saving Matt
you're best friends again?

845
01:04:20,156 --> 01:04:21,606
He is my son.

846
01:04:21,691 --> 01:04:23,525
I'm your daughter.

847
01:04:24,994 --> 01:04:27,362
You guys are always there for him
and you're never there for me.

848
01:04:30,783 --> 01:04:33,735
Hey get that one. No no the
other one.

849
01:04:34,420 --> 01:04:35,670
You don't think I try?

850
01:04:37,206 --> 01:04:39,207
Not hard enough.

851
01:04:43,713 --> 01:04:44,913
I came for you first.

852
01:04:48,768 --> 01:04:49,751
Try to remember that.

853
01:04:52,605 --> 01:04:54,189
Come on. Come on.

854
01:05:16,612 --> 01:05:17,445
Hey.

855
01:05:18,080 --> 01:05:19,614
I fell off a slide when I was 2.

856
01:05:20,449 --> 01:05:21,883
It hurt like hell.

857
01:05:21,951 --> 01:05:23,451
Now people think it's cool.

858
01:05:25,287 --> 01:05:27,222
No body thinks this is cool.

859
01:05:29,759 --> 01:05:30,892
What happened?

860
01:05:32,795 --> 01:05:33,979
I had a tattoo removed.

861
01:05:40,069 --> 01:05:41,135
I don't like to talk about it.

862
01:05:46,308 --> 01:05:46,942
[Sigh]

863
01:05:52,031 --> 01:05:53,999
I was raised by my grandparents.

864
01:05:55,835 --> 01:06:00,839
We I was 7 my grandpa took me
fishing with one of those day
charter deals with his friends.

865
01:06:02,491 --> 01:06:06,761
We end up hitting into a reef
and the boat went down.

866
01:06:07,430 --> 01:06:13,852
My grandfather took me and put me
inside this little life- raft for safety.

867
01:06:15,187 --> 01:06:20,809
Everyone else was kinda swimming
around trying to stay up and
suddenly all these

868
01:06:21,644 --> 01:06:23,979
sharks just started swarming and-

869
01:06:25,898 --> 01:06:27,649
and then they...

870
01:06:28,350 --> 01:06:29,951
tried to protect me but...

871
01:06:32,187 --> 01:06:33,822
By morning they were all gone.

872
01:06:36,191 --> 01:06:40,361
So I floated out there for 2 days
until one of those coast guard

873
01:06:40,413 --> 01:06:42,747
helicopters finally spotted me.

874
01:06:44,383 --> 01:06:51,056
I thought I was safe but suddenly
this shark leaped up and bit my leg.

875
01:06:52,308 --> 01:06:56,811
6 people went into the water and
one little girl came out.

876
01:06:58,597 --> 01:06:59,981
The sharks took the rest.

877
01:07:03,936 --> 01:07:06,187
They took my grandfather.

878
01:07:07,523 --> 01:07:09,274
So I really hate sharks.

879
01:07:11,727 --> 01:07:14,079
Now I really hate sharks too.

880
01:07:14,163 --> 01:07:16,331
[Chuckles]

881
01:07:17,166 --> 01:07:18,333
Nice work kids.

882

We're going to move to plan B.

Baz builds a bigger bomb, and
drives this in into the storm.

888
01:08:11,454 --> 01:08:13,321
That's not gonna work. It's a
