1
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:01,393
Fans here at
Sportsman's are glued to their seats

2
00:01:01,478 --> 00:01:03,896
as the Cardinals and Dodgers
are even at two apiece.

3
00:01:03,938 --> 00:01:07,107
Sal Maglie takes the sign
from Campanella. He winds up.

4
00:01:07,192 --> 00:01:09,068
Here's the pitch! Whammo!

5
00:01:09,110 --> 00:01:10,861
Musial's bat cracks off
at his fist

6
00:01:10,945 --> 00:01:13,280
as he sizzles
one to Gil Hodges,

7
00:01:13,364 --> 00:01:17,951
Musial is two for two!
Does anyone want a slightly used bat?

8
00:01:24,084 --> 00:01:26,794
I... I was promised.

9
00:01:26,878 --> 00:01:28,921
Promised? By who?

10
00:01:29,005 --> 00:01:30,130
By Eddie Stanky.

11
00:01:30,215 --> 00:01:32,007
Stanky's gone.

12
00:01:32,092 --> 00:01:33,759
Mr. Tanner,

13
00:01:33,843 --> 00:01:35,677
I've been working
on this shot for years.

14
00:01:35,762 --> 00:01:37,638
You'll get other shots,
but this is the Majors,

15
00:01:37,722 --> 00:01:39,598
and we need to bring in
somebody who's...

16
00:01:39,682 --> 00:01:43,227
Who's what?
Not Mexican?

17
00:01:51,778 --> 00:01:53,654
Look here,
when Stanky found you

18
00:01:53,738 --> 00:01:56,073
you were a batboy
in San Antonio.

19
00:01:56,157 --> 00:01:58,283
Hornsby hired you.
I didn't.

20
00:01:58,368 --> 00:02:01,453
It's my team now,
and you'll do what you're told.

21
00:02:01,538 --> 00:02:04,665
That's all, we're done.

22
00:02:08,002 --> 00:02:10,295
I didn't get it.

23
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:11,839
Where you going?

24
00:02:11,923 --> 00:02:13,048
Monterrey, Mexico.

25
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:14,508
Why?

26
00:02:14,592 --> 00:02:15,968
That's where
my folks are from.

27
00:02:16,052 --> 00:02:17,636
You don't know
anyone there.

28
00:02:17,679 --> 00:02:21,640
Yeah, well I thought
I knew people here.

29
00:02:21,683 --> 00:02:23,142
Cesar!

30
00:05:25,283 --> 00:05:26,575
By the end
of the shift,

31
00:05:26,659 --> 00:05:29,036
I want all
of this removed.

32
00:05:32,582 --> 00:05:35,250
Hey you!

33
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:36,877
Boss needs
this slag cleared.

34
00:05:36,961 --> 00:05:39,504
Sounds good. Why
don't you get it done?

35
00:05:41,090 --> 00:05:42,716
Why don't you go
back to America?

36
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,426
I hear he can't.

37
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:46,511
Maybe he killed somebody.

38
00:05:46,554 --> 00:05:50,349
You think you're better than us,
Mr. Baseball Man?

39
00:05:50,433 --> 00:05:52,684
Look where it got you.

40
00:05:54,896 --> 00:05:57,189
You'll never know what
it is to have anything

41
00:05:57,273 --> 00:05:59,691
'cause you'll never
have anything to lose.

42
00:06:07,825 --> 00:06:09,618
Cesar!

43
00:06:09,702 --> 00:06:11,578
A few months ago,

44
00:06:11,662 --> 00:06:14,373
his oldest boy was playing
at the Church of the Dead.

45
00:06:14,457 --> 00:06:17,417
All of our boys did,
but his slipped and fell.

46
00:06:17,502 --> 00:06:20,587
Our Father who art in Heaven,
hallowed be thy name.

47
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:23,757
Thy kingdom come, thy will be done,
on Earth as it is in heaven.

48
00:06:23,841 --> 00:06:26,968
Give us this day our daily bread
and forgive our trespasses

49
00:06:27,053 --> 00:06:29,638
as we forgive those who
trespass against us.

50
00:06:29,722 --> 00:06:33,308
And lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us from evil. Amen.

51
00:06:33,393 --> 00:06:38,397
Today, we command the spirit
of Pedro Macias into Your hands.

52
00:06:38,439 --> 00:06:42,609
In the name of the Father,
and the Son, and the Holy Ghost.

53
00:06:42,693 --> 00:06:46,113
Pedro was a good boy,

54
00:06:46,197 --> 00:06:49,908
a very good boy.

55
00:06:52,745 --> 00:06:55,831
By the end
of the shift.

56
00:07:01,671 --> 00:07:04,589
You want someone?
Take me.

57
00:07:11,848 --> 00:07:14,266
These children
have nothing.

58
00:07:14,308 --> 00:07:16,685
How can I give them hope?

59
00:07:16,769 --> 00:07:19,271
Thank you.

60
00:07:35,204 --> 00:07:37,622
And that's two outs!

61
00:07:37,707 --> 00:07:41,668
Brooklyn Dodger fans are on their feet for the rookie,
Sandy Koufax.

62
00:07:41,752 --> 00:07:47,132
The poor lanky kid who rose from the
streets of Brooklyn to the Major Leagues.

63
00:07:47,175 --> 00:07:49,384
Koufax, studies the sign...

64
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:53,555
He winds up.

65
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:57,809
And here's the pitch.
Strike three! He's done it!

66
00:07:57,894 --> 00:08:00,187
Koufax has just pitched
his first shutout,

67
00:08:00,271 --> 00:08:02,647
allowing Cincinnati
only two hits!

68
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:07,402
What a performance,
this kid has champion written all over him!

69
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:09,321
Koufax studies the sign.

70
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,244
Ugh.

71
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:19,039
Mario! It's a Holy Day,
not a time for games.

72
00:08:19,123 --> 00:08:21,124
If God didn't want us to play games,

73
00:08:21,209 --> 00:08:24,961
he wouldn't have made them so much fun!
Right?

74
00:08:34,764 --> 00:08:36,932
Will you shut him up?
I'm trying to sleep!

75
00:08:37,016 --> 00:08:38,517
He has to practice
for choir.

76
00:08:40,186 --> 00:08:44,981
Choir? You're turning
him into a woman.

77
00:08:45,066 --> 00:08:48,360
You shut him up,
or I'll do it myself.

78
00:08:52,698 --> 00:08:54,115
Why did you stop?

79
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:56,785
It's all right, Mama.
I'm finished.

80
00:08:56,869 --> 00:08:59,246
Your Father's
not an evil man.

81
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:02,874
He just... can't
feel anymore.

82
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:04,376
Is he ever gonna get better?

83
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:05,961
I don't know.

84
00:09:06,045 --> 00:09:08,463
Father Esteban says
anything's possible

85
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:10,632
with the help of God.

86
00:09:30,903 --> 00:09:32,153
Ha! You're out!

87
00:09:32,238 --> 00:09:33,989
I tipped it!

88
00:09:34,073 --> 00:09:36,408
Boys. It's time.

89
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:37,909
Come.

90
00:09:39,495 --> 00:09:41,663
Did so tip it.

91
00:09:41,747 --> 00:09:43,832
Gil Hodges steps up to the plate...

92
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:45,875
Do you think we have a chance?

93
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:48,003
Two outs,
down by three in the bottom of the 9th!

94
00:09:48,087 --> 00:09:49,754
Enrique, I meant
this season.

95
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:52,090
You know the beautiful
thing about opening day

96
00:09:52,174 --> 00:09:53,925
is today, every team
is in first place.

97
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:55,802
Yankees got lucky
last year.

98
00:09:55,886 --> 00:09:59,264
Lucky?
You call Don Larson's perfect game, lucky?

99
00:09:59,348 --> 00:10:01,016
What's a perfect game?

100
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:05,312
No runs,
no hits, no walks.

101
00:10:05,396 --> 00:10:06,563
No one
gets to first.

102
00:10:06,647 --> 00:10:08,273
Yeah.

103
00:10:08,357 --> 00:10:12,277
To me,
baseball is always perfect.

104
00:10:12,361 --> 00:10:15,614
I imagine when you look out from home plate,

105
00:10:15,656 --> 00:10:18,783
the field
has no end.

106
00:10:18,826 --> 00:10:23,288
And until the final out,
you can, you can play forever.

107
00:10:25,374 --> 00:10:29,586
And only God can make something infinite and eternal.

108
00:10:30,713 --> 00:10:32,964
Si.

109
00:10:33,049 --> 00:10:36,176
Snider hits a deep fly ball!
Back to the wall,

110
00:10:38,262 --> 00:10:39,638
Our Dodgers have spirit.

111
00:10:39,722 --> 00:10:41,556
And Duke Snider.

112
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:43,725
And that's why Yogi Berra says,

113
00:10:43,809 --> 00:10:45,894
'lt ain't over
'till it's over'

114
00:10:54,362 --> 00:10:55,737
You're late.

115
00:10:55,821 --> 00:10:57,739
The game went
into extra innings.

116
00:10:57,823 --> 00:11:00,825
No. You're not on time for dinner,
you don't eat.

117
00:11:00,868 --> 00:11:02,702
You got
chores to do.

118
00:11:02,787 --> 00:11:04,829
Tonight you can
clean out the corral.

119
00:11:04,914 --> 00:11:06,498
It's too filthy,
even for a pig.

120
00:11:06,582 --> 00:11:08,500
Umberto.

121
00:11:08,584 --> 00:11:12,837
When I was his age,
I had to help put food on the table.

122
00:11:12,922 --> 00:11:14,506
Go!

123
00:11:26,018 --> 00:11:28,853
You're not going to find answers in there.

124
00:11:28,896 --> 00:11:30,146
Where then?

125
00:11:30,231 --> 00:11:31,940
God.

126
00:11:32,024 --> 00:11:34,359
God took my son.

127
00:11:34,402 --> 00:11:37,445
He sacrificed his only son!
We have Angel!

128
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:41,700
Angel will never be the son that Pedro was.
Never.

129
00:11:47,081 --> 00:11:48,707
Angel?

130
00:12:13,733 --> 00:12:18,737
Pedro! Pedro!

131
00:12:18,821 --> 00:12:21,740
Pedro!

132
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:24,052
What are you doing?

133
00:13:24,136 --> 00:13:25,178
I'm Sandy Koufax.

134
00:13:25,262 --> 00:13:27,514
The pitcher.

135
00:13:41,487 --> 00:13:43,238
Well, Koufax,

136
00:13:43,322 --> 00:13:46,366
you just ruined
my siesta.

137
00:13:49,578 --> 00:13:51,579
Koufax is a lefty.

138
00:14:03,133 --> 00:14:04,634
And Jewish.

139
00:14:04,718 --> 00:14:07,762
Yes. Yes. I'm Jew...
I'm Ju... Je...

140
00:14:07,847 --> 00:14:10,849
Whatever you said.

141
00:14:10,891 --> 00:14:13,268
Well, it hasn't
improved your aim any.

142
00:14:13,352 --> 00:14:16,688
What do you know?

143
00:14:21,151 --> 00:14:22,360
Hey.

144
00:14:44,174 --> 00:14:46,593
Hey,
where'd you get this?

145
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:50,388
It... It's from God.

146
00:14:54,018 --> 00:14:56,811
You best take
care of that.

147
00:15:00,190 --> 00:15:02,066
Can I touch it?

148
00:15:02,151 --> 00:15:03,902
Yes,
of course you can touch it.

149
00:15:03,944 --> 00:15:07,322
It's heavier than I thought.

150
00:15:07,406 --> 00:15:09,157
Let me see.

151
00:15:09,241 --> 00:15:11,409
Whoa.

152
00:15:16,206 --> 00:15:18,708
It's like
a woman's skin.

153
00:15:22,421 --> 00:15:25,423
Father.
What does it mean?

154
00:15:25,507 --> 00:15:27,425
It means God wants
us to play baseball.

155
00:15:27,509 --> 00:15:29,594
Angel.

156
00:15:29,678 --> 00:15:31,262
That's what
I think it means.

157
00:15:31,347 --> 00:15:32,805
Me, too.

158
00:15:32,890 --> 00:15:34,599
What happens
when we lose this one?

159
00:15:34,683 --> 00:15:36,476
Is God going to drop another one from the sky?

160
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:39,312
He's God.
He can do anything.

161
00:15:39,396 --> 00:15:42,565
Father, what
does it say?

162
00:15:44,526 --> 00:15:46,986
It says it
belonged to a saint.

163
00:15:47,071 --> 00:15:48,696
Wow.

164
00:15:51,492 --> 00:15:53,785
Angel,

165
00:15:53,869 --> 00:15:56,537
maybe next time you can ask him to give us a bat!

166
00:16:26,902 --> 00:16:28,403
You again.

167
00:16:28,487 --> 00:16:29,654
Want to have a catch?

168
00:16:29,738 --> 00:16:31,239
No.

169
00:16:31,323 --> 00:16:33,992
Okay, I guess
I'll just

170
00:16:34,034 --> 00:16:36,411
have to practice
everyday by myself.

171
00:16:36,495 --> 00:16:39,414
Every single day,
right here!

172
00:16:39,498 --> 00:16:41,165
Everyday!

173
00:17:06,275 --> 00:17:08,609
All right.
Just this once.

174
00:17:08,694 --> 00:17:13,031
Then you have to promise me you're
going to pitch somewhere else, agreed?

175
00:17:26,503 --> 00:17:29,714
Wow. Who taught
you to pitch?

176
00:17:29,798 --> 00:17:30,798
Cardinals.

177
00:17:30,883 --> 00:17:33,092
In the Basilica?

178
00:17:33,177 --> 00:17:36,471
Saint Louis.

179
00:17:46,231 --> 00:17:47,982
The Saint Louis
Cardinals?

180
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:49,567
That's right.

181
00:17:49,651 --> 00:17:51,069
You played
in the Majors?

182
00:17:51,111 --> 00:17:54,739
Well, sorta,
I... I coached.

183
00:17:54,823 --> 00:17:56,449
I'm a Dodger fan.

184
00:17:56,533 --> 00:17:58,451
Yeah, you're
Sandy Koufax.

185
00:18:02,956 --> 00:18:06,918
Quiet! There she is!
My girlfriend.

186
00:18:07,002 --> 00:18:08,419
Oh yeah?
Then go talk to her.

187
00:18:08,462 --> 00:18:09,921
Yeah.

188
00:18:10,005 --> 00:18:12,924
I have to wait
for the right moment.

189
00:18:12,966 --> 00:18:17,053
How about now?
Enrique, catch!

190
00:18:19,264 --> 00:18:22,266
Oops.
A little help, please!

191
00:18:24,019 --> 00:18:27,855
Hi, Gloria,
such a surprise!

192
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:29,107
What is this?

193
00:18:29,149 --> 00:18:31,150
I-I-lt's a baseball.

194
00:18:31,235 --> 00:18:32,443
A real one!

195
00:18:32,528 --> 00:18:33,861
Are these
your friends?

196
00:18:33,946 --> 00:18:35,363
We are his teammates!

197
00:18:35,447 --> 00:18:36,697
Yeah, we're
a real baseball team.

198
00:18:36,782 --> 00:18:37,949
Best in Monterrey!

199
00:18:43,831 --> 00:18:48,126
You know, they told me Monterrey
had the most beautiful girls in Mexico.

200
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:50,628
Too bad for you,
we're on our way to America.

201
00:18:50,712 --> 00:18:52,880
Yeah, too bad.

202
00:18:52,965 --> 00:18:57,718
So Gloria, I was thinking, I could,
walk you home or something?!

203
00:18:57,803 --> 00:19:00,304
Sorry, my father
picks me up.

204
00:19:00,347 --> 00:19:02,557
Ooh! Popped up
to the catcher.

205
00:19:02,641 --> 00:19:03,891
How embarrassing.

206
00:19:03,976 --> 00:19:05,351
Who do you
think you are?

207
00:19:05,435 --> 00:19:07,395
We're the
Mexico City All Stars.

208
00:19:07,479 --> 00:19:08,813
Can you read?

209
00:19:08,897 --> 00:19:10,398
Sons of gringo
businessmen!

210
00:19:10,482 --> 00:19:12,233
Why don't you play
with Mexicans?

211
00:19:12,317 --> 00:19:14,235
With babies,
like you?

212
00:19:14,319 --> 00:19:17,321
Who are you calling 'babies'?
Dummy.

213
00:19:17,364 --> 00:19:19,574
Come on, guys.

214
00:19:20,909 --> 00:19:23,077
I'll never
get Gloria.

215
00:19:23,162 --> 00:19:26,414
You're not worth getting dirty over.
We're going to America.

216
00:19:26,498 --> 00:19:28,332
America.

217
00:19:30,502 --> 00:19:32,587
Father.

218
00:19:32,671 --> 00:19:34,964
Sorry, but we need to make the team now.

219
00:19:35,048 --> 00:19:37,383
Angel, what
is the hurry?

220
00:19:37,467 --> 00:19:41,012
We're 12.
See, we can't play in the league next year.

221
00:19:41,054 --> 00:19:42,847
Hmm. I see.

222
00:19:42,931 --> 00:19:45,057
Well then, you'll
need a coach.

223
00:19:45,142 --> 00:19:46,684
You could
be our coach!

224
00:19:46,768 --> 00:19:47,560
No, not me.

225
00:19:47,644 --> 00:19:49,729
Please.

226
00:19:49,813 --> 00:19:53,191
You need somebody who knows the game,
not just stick ball.

227
00:19:53,275 --> 00:19:56,027
I don't know anybody
like that in Monterrey.

228
00:19:57,779 --> 00:19:59,447
I do.

229
00:19:59,531 --> 00:20:01,407
What now?

230
00:20:01,491 --> 00:20:03,534
We are making a Little League team!

231
00:20:03,619 --> 00:20:04,952
Who's we?

232
00:20:05,037 --> 00:20:06,454
My friends
and Father Esteban.

233
00:20:06,538 --> 00:20:08,289
You can meet
him tomorrow at Mass.

234
00:20:08,373 --> 00:20:10,291
Church?
I don't think so kid.

235
00:20:12,544 --> 00:20:15,421
Do you like her?

236
00:20:15,505 --> 00:20:17,089
Who?

237
00:20:17,174 --> 00:20:19,759
I think you
are in love.

238
00:20:19,843 --> 00:20:23,596
Nah,
there's plenty of fish in the sea.

239
00:20:25,349 --> 00:20:27,391
Not like
that mermaid.

240
00:20:27,476 --> 00:20:29,769
You know her?

241
00:20:29,853 --> 00:20:31,896
No,
but I know where she'll be tomorrow morning.

242
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:33,189
Where?

243
00:20:37,152 --> 00:20:40,321
Mea culpa Mea culpa Mea maxima culpa

244
00:21:06,682 --> 00:21:08,975
Father Esteban,
this is Cesar Faz.

245
00:21:09,059 --> 00:21:10,142
Ah, yes.

246
00:21:10,227 --> 00:21:12,270
Good morning, Father.

247
00:21:12,354 --> 00:21:15,690
Angel tells me you used to coach
in the Major League Baseball.

248
00:21:15,774 --> 00:21:17,692
Yeah, yeah, I did.

249
00:21:17,776 --> 00:21:19,819
Well, it must have
been something.

250
00:21:19,903 --> 00:21:22,613
It was something.

251
00:21:22,656 --> 00:21:26,492
Yes, well,
they would like to have that same feeling, you know?

252
00:21:26,576 --> 00:21:29,120
In the American
Little League.

253
00:21:29,204 --> 00:21:34,625
Mr. Faz, will you be our coach?
Will you take us to America?

254
00:21:39,339 --> 00:21:42,508
It would take a miracle to make
these kids into a real team.

255
00:21:42,592 --> 00:21:45,761
Sometimes, God gives us
the ability to make them.

256
00:21:45,846 --> 00:21:46,679
Teams?

257
00:21:46,763 --> 00:21:48,222
Miracles.

258
00:21:48,307 --> 00:21:51,058
These kids don't
even have a field.

259
00:21:51,143 --> 00:21:53,811
Sorry, kid.

260
00:22:23,884 --> 00:22:26,844
Couldn't pick a place with more rocks, huh?

261
00:22:26,887 --> 00:22:28,220
Nope.

262
00:22:37,397 --> 00:22:39,482
- We did it.
- Si.

263
00:22:39,566 --> 00:22:42,818
Yeah, the infield.
What about the outfield?

264
00:22:54,664 --> 00:22:56,207
Angel.

265
00:22:57,876 --> 00:22:59,251
Angel!

266
00:23:03,048 --> 00:23:07,385
Mr. Faz!

267
00:23:07,427 --> 00:23:08,969
Want to have a catch?!

268
00:23:13,058 --> 00:23:14,475
Angel.

269
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:20,564
Angel.

270
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:40,501
Well, we have a field.

271
00:23:40,585 --> 00:23:42,420
Yeah. You got
a field.

272
00:23:51,721 --> 00:23:53,597
Lucky. It's Cesar.

273
00:23:53,682 --> 00:23:55,474
Cesar? How
the heck are you?

274
00:23:55,559 --> 00:23:57,977
You still got your contacts
in Williamsport?

275
00:23:58,061 --> 00:24:00,354
I need you to pull
some strings,

276
00:24:00,439 --> 00:24:03,107
and help me get Monterrey a Little League franchise.

277
00:24:03,191 --> 00:24:05,526
Little League? I thought
you didn't like kids.

278
00:24:05,610 --> 00:24:07,945
Well, you going to lecture me or you going to help me?

279
00:24:08,029 --> 00:24:09,905
You know that's a pretty tall order this late in the game.

280
00:24:09,990 --> 00:24:11,949
I watched you
deck a shore patrolman

281
00:24:12,033 --> 00:24:14,452
and then sweet-talk him into
driving you back to your ship.

282
00:24:14,536 --> 00:24:16,787
I know what you can
do on a one-day leave.

283
00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:19,039
Oh, good, I didn't know
I had a whole day.

284
00:24:19,124 --> 00:24:21,375
Holler when you're hurting.

285
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:22,668
Oh, I'm hollering.

286
00:24:25,672 --> 00:24:27,631
Five skills in baseball.

287
00:24:27,716 --> 00:24:31,844
Running, catching,
throwing, hitting,

288
00:24:34,639 --> 00:24:35,431
And hitting harder.

289
00:24:37,517 --> 00:24:39,310
They already know how to do all these things.

290
00:24:39,394 --> 00:24:41,604
They just need you to tell them when to do them.

291
00:24:41,688 --> 00:24:42,646
Wow.

292
00:24:42,731 --> 00:24:44,231
Um, thank you.

293
00:24:49,488 --> 00:24:50,571
Oops.

294
00:24:50,655 --> 00:24:52,239
Oh, uh.

295
00:24:56,036 --> 00:24:59,580
You shouldn't hold
that so tightly.

296
00:24:59,664 --> 00:25:03,542
You'll bruise
the delicate fruit inside.

297
00:25:03,627 --> 00:25:07,213
You were in church
on Sunday, right?

298
00:25:07,297 --> 00:25:10,591
Yes, yes I was in church on Sunday.
That was me.

299
00:25:10,675 --> 00:25:11,967
I'm Maria.

300
00:25:12,052 --> 00:25:13,928
I'm Cesar Faz.

301
00:25:14,012 --> 00:25:16,055
You, uh...

302
00:25:16,139 --> 00:25:18,098
you buy food here?

303
00:25:18,183 --> 00:25:22,353
Yes, Cesar Faz,
it's a food market.

304
00:25:22,437 --> 00:25:25,064
Right.

305
00:25:25,148 --> 00:25:27,274
And what
do you do here?

306
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:30,027
I'm here scouting
for the team.

307
00:25:30,111 --> 00:25:31,862
Oh, what kind of team?

308
00:25:31,947 --> 00:25:33,239
Little
League baseball!

309
00:25:33,323 --> 00:25:34,740
Here? In Monterrey?

310
00:25:34,824 --> 00:25:36,951
First time
for everything, right?

311
00:25:37,035 --> 00:25:39,370
Like Cesar Faz
coming to my church.

312
00:25:39,454 --> 00:25:42,873
That's right. Yeah.

313
00:25:42,958 --> 00:25:45,042
Well, that's all
I came for.

314
00:25:45,085 --> 00:25:46,669
Yeah, we,
you and I,

315
00:25:46,753 --> 00:25:49,255
uh, should go out?

316
00:25:49,339 --> 00:25:54,260
Um,
would you like to join my family for dinner, tonight?

317
00:25:54,344 --> 00:25:56,470
Yeah. Yeah. Tonight?

318
00:25:56,555 --> 00:25:58,055
Mm-hm.

319
00:25:58,139 --> 00:25:59,890
Yeah. That sounds
real nice.

320
00:25:59,975 --> 00:26:01,976
7 o'clock then?

321
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:03,602
7 o'clock.

322
00:26:03,687 --> 00:26:04,979
Bye.

323
00:26:05,063 --> 00:26:06,438
Father.

324
00:26:14,406 --> 00:26:17,283
What are you guys doing here?

325
00:26:17,367 --> 00:26:18,909
Recruiting, remember?

326
00:26:18,994 --> 00:26:21,370
I think Mr. Faz
has been recruiting.

327
00:26:21,454 --> 00:26:22,788
Okay, okay, who
do we got?

328
00:26:25,041 --> 00:26:26,917
That's Fidel Ruiz.

329
00:26:31,965 --> 00:26:33,424
Man, that kid can run.

330
00:26:33,508 --> 00:26:35,009
Tell him it's a sin
to steal.

331
00:26:35,093 --> 00:26:37,094
Unless it's bases.
He's in.

332
00:26:37,178 --> 00:26:38,804
How about that kid that murdered
that cardboard decoration?

333
00:26:38,888 --> 00:26:40,264
Baltazar!

334
00:26:40,348 --> 00:26:42,182
He's the strongest
kid in town.

335
00:26:42,267 --> 00:26:44,268
He's in. Okay. Angel,
Enrique, Ricardo, Fidel.

336
00:26:44,311 --> 00:26:46,103
What about Mario?

337
00:26:46,146 --> 00:26:48,230
Yes, yes,
Mario's important.

338
00:26:49,983 --> 00:26:52,610
He's pretty small.
Is he a great hitter?

339
00:26:52,652 --> 00:26:54,653
Um, not so much.

340
00:26:54,738 --> 00:26:56,488
Fantastic fielder?

341
00:26:56,573 --> 00:26:58,782
Uh, not so much.

342
00:26:58,867 --> 00:27:00,868
Mario.

343
00:27:00,952 --> 00:27:03,329
You got a great
arm, right?

344
00:27:03,413 --> 00:27:04,455
Not so much.

345
00:27:04,539 --> 00:27:06,624
Mr. Faz.

346
00:27:06,666 --> 00:27:09,209
Why's he so special?

347
00:27:09,294 --> 00:27:11,837
Because he knows all the girls.

348
00:27:11,921 --> 00:27:13,631
Mario. You
got a glove?

349
00:27:13,715 --> 00:27:15,090
Yeah!

350
00:27:15,175 --> 00:27:17,217
Mario, you're in.

351
00:27:17,302 --> 00:27:18,552
Okay,
I want you on the field in an hour.

352
00:27:18,637 --> 00:27:19,678
What about the flowers?

353
00:27:19,763 --> 00:27:20,679
Flowers? For what?

354
00:27:20,764 --> 00:27:22,181
For Maria.

355
00:27:22,265 --> 00:27:23,849
Maybe you didn't
hear that beauty,

356
00:27:23,933 --> 00:27:25,851
just invite me to her house for dinner.

357
00:27:25,935 --> 00:27:27,019
Really?

358
00:27:27,103 --> 00:27:30,981
Where does she live?

359
00:27:31,066 --> 00:27:34,401
Diego Martin number 5.

360
00:27:34,486 --> 00:27:36,320
And don't forget
the flowers.

361
00:27:36,404 --> 00:27:38,906
Dear Lord,
bless these boys

362
00:27:38,990 --> 00:27:41,241
and the field
on which they play

363
00:27:41,326 --> 00:27:44,078
for your greater
honor and glory.

364
00:27:44,162 --> 00:27:47,706
Father. Son.
Holy Ghost. Amen.

365
00:27:49,668 --> 00:27:52,169
Does anybody know the Holy Trinity of baseball?

366
00:27:52,253 --> 00:27:55,506
The Father,
The Son, and The Holy Ghost.

367
00:27:55,548 --> 00:27:59,718
Close. Home runs, RBI's,
and batting averages.

368
00:27:59,803 --> 00:28:03,013
And they all revolve around this.

369
00:28:09,979 --> 00:28:11,855
Looking good, Pepe.

370
00:28:14,859 --> 00:28:16,193
Who are you?

371
00:28:16,236 --> 00:28:18,028
I'm Pepe Maiz Garcia.

372
00:28:18,113 --> 00:28:19,863
I play left field.

373
00:28:19,948 --> 00:28:22,116
But coach hasn't
made positions yet.

374
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:23,909
Well we'll see.

375
00:28:28,915 --> 00:28:31,875
Boys, meet your
new left fielder.

376
00:28:35,672 --> 00:28:36,880
You think your Dad
can buy your way onto the team?

377
00:28:36,965 --> 00:28:38,757
Money isn't everything.

378
00:28:38,842 --> 00:28:40,676
Yeah, well, you don't have any.
And you never will.

379
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:42,886
At least I'll always be able to kick your butt.

380
00:28:42,929 --> 00:28:45,305
All right everybody!
Heads up! Runner on first.

381
00:28:45,390 --> 00:28:47,933
One out, play to second.
Ready? Fidel.

382
00:28:48,017 --> 00:28:49,977
What runner Mr. Faz?
There's no one on the base.

383
00:28:50,061 --> 00:28:52,062
Pretend.

384
00:28:55,066 --> 00:28:57,985
Yogi Berra said 90
% of the game is half mental.

385
00:28:58,069 --> 00:29:00,070
Well I must be
100 % mental

386
00:29:00,155 --> 00:29:04,241
to think that I could teach you
kids baseball in four weeks.

387
00:29:06,703 --> 00:29:08,370
Baltazar!

388
00:29:10,665 --> 00:29:11,749
What happened?

389
00:29:11,791 --> 00:29:13,417
You said Baltazar.

390
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:16,670
The unexpected play
at the unexpected time.

391
00:29:16,755 --> 00:29:18,464
That's what we're
training for!

392
00:29:18,548 --> 00:29:20,591
Nice play, girl.

393
00:29:20,675 --> 00:29:23,093
Come on, you kids.
Keep it together.

394
00:29:23,178 --> 00:29:24,261
Ugh.

395
00:29:25,930 --> 00:29:27,055
Hey! Hey!

396
00:29:30,351 --> 00:29:32,686
There's two
kinds of players.

397
00:29:32,771 --> 00:29:36,106
Those who can play as a team and
those who won't be on this team!

398
00:29:36,191 --> 00:29:39,485
You got
that! Alright.

399
00:29:39,569 --> 00:29:41,820
Everybody, five laps.

400
00:29:41,905 --> 00:29:44,865
It was their fight,
we shouldn't all have to run five laps!

401
00:29:44,949 --> 00:29:48,368
Norberto's right.
Everybody, ten laps! Move it!

402
00:29:50,038 --> 00:29:51,955
You all rise
and fall together!

403
00:29:54,876 --> 00:29:56,960
What am I doing?

404
00:30:05,011 --> 00:30:06,470
Again!

405
00:30:08,681 --> 00:30:10,766
Again!
Make sure you get it!

406
00:30:13,144 --> 00:30:14,728
Grounder!

407
00:30:16,731 --> 00:30:18,232
What are you doing?

408
00:30:18,316 --> 00:30:20,734
Mr. Faz,
you have a date!

409
00:30:20,819 --> 00:30:24,488
Get back to your
position! Go!

410
00:30:26,282 --> 00:30:29,993
Again!

411
00:30:55,895 --> 00:30:58,438
Anyone jogging's going to make the whole team

412
00:30:58,523 --> 00:30:59,940
run an extra
five laps,

413
00:31:00,024 --> 00:31:01,859
and I know you
don't want that.

414
00:31:01,943 --> 00:31:05,028
You want to be a champ,
you got to run like a champ.

415
00:31:07,907 --> 00:31:10,033
Come on,
keep up, Ricardo.

416
00:31:15,206 --> 00:31:17,457
Way to go, Norberto.

417
00:31:17,542 --> 00:31:20,627
I don't know what men do in America,
but in Mexico,

418
00:31:20,712 --> 00:31:23,463
they treat a woman
with more respect.

419
00:31:23,548 --> 00:31:25,132
Sorry.

420
00:31:25,216 --> 00:31:27,509
Practice ran late,
and running the boys...

421
00:31:27,594 --> 00:31:29,720
Perhaps you
just forgot.

422
00:31:29,804 --> 00:31:33,223
Mr.
Faz, here are the flowers you got for the lady yesterday.

423
00:31:33,308 --> 00:31:35,225
Flowers?

424
00:31:35,268 --> 00:31:37,603
You got this for me?

425
00:31:37,687 --> 00:31:41,231
I... I know you told me to put them in water,

426
00:31:41,274 --> 00:31:43,901
they're
a little wilted.

427
00:31:43,985 --> 00:31:46,111
They're beautiful.

428
00:31:47,530 --> 00:31:51,700
Um, Mario.
Your laps.

429
00:31:51,784 --> 00:31:56,163
Oh!
Because I didn't put the flowers in the water, right!

430
00:31:56,247 --> 00:31:57,748
It's okay.

431
00:32:22,398 --> 00:32:26,276
♫ Take me out
To the Ballgame ♫

432
00:32:29,197 --> 00:32:33,283
♫ Take me out to the crowd ♫

433
00:32:36,037 --> 00:32:38,956
♫ Buy me some peanuts ♫

434
00:32:38,998 --> 00:32:42,834
♫ And cracker jack ♫

435
00:32:42,919 --> 00:32:47,422
♫ I don't care
If I never get back ♫

436
00:32:47,507 --> 00:32:54,346
♫ Let me root, root, root
For the home team ♫

437
00:32:54,430 --> 00:33:00,644
♫And if they don't win
it's a shame ♫

438
00:33:00,728 --> 00:33:03,647
♫For it's one ♫

439
00:33:03,690 --> 00:33:05,565
♫ Two ♫

440
00:33:05,650 --> 00:33:08,026
♫ Three strikes, you're out ♫

441
00:33:08,111 --> 00:33:13,240
♫ At the old ball game ♫

442
00:33:13,324 --> 00:33:15,158
♫ Yeah ♫

443
00:33:15,201 --> 00:33:21,581
♫ Let me root, root, root
For the home team ♫

444
00:33:21,666 --> 00:33:24,918
♫ And if they don't win ♫

445
00:33:25,003 --> 00:33:28,171
♫ It's a shame ♫

446
00:33:28,214 --> 00:33:30,507
♫ For it's one ♫

447
00:33:30,591 --> 00:33:32,592
♫ Two ♫

448
00:33:32,677 --> 00:33:35,012
♫ Three strikes, you're out ♫

449
00:33:35,096 --> 00:33:39,182
♫ At the old ball game ♫

450
00:33:39,225 --> 00:33:41,184
Now I have some
announcements to make,

451
00:33:41,269 --> 00:33:43,186
thanks to your
continuing prayers,

452
00:33:43,271 --> 00:33:45,939
Mrs. Montez's boils
have finally healed.

453
00:33:48,192 --> 00:33:51,278
And Senora Santana,

454
00:33:51,362 --> 00:33:54,781
has given birth
to triplets!

455
00:34:06,919 --> 00:34:09,212
And lastly,

456
00:34:09,297 --> 00:34:15,135
Monterrey, has just been awarded
its very first Little League franchise!

457
00:34:15,219 --> 00:34:18,597
♫ For it's one, two ♫

458
00:34:18,681 --> 00:34:21,224
♫♫ Three strikes,
You're out ♫

459
00:34:21,267 --> 00:34:28,774
♫♫ At the old ball game ♫♫

460
00:34:42,955 --> 00:34:45,082
They're limping.

461
00:34:45,124 --> 00:34:48,794
I made them wear their baseball
shoes for the past few days.

462
00:34:48,878 --> 00:34:50,462
But their feet
will blister.

463
00:34:50,546 --> 00:34:52,297
Better now
than at the field.

464
00:34:52,381 --> 00:34:54,091
You're treating them like you're still a manager

465
00:34:54,133 --> 00:34:56,510
in that magic
league in St. Louis.

466
00:34:56,594 --> 00:34:58,011
It's Major League,
Maria, Major.

467
00:34:58,096 --> 00:35:00,013
Still, it seems
mean to me.

468
00:35:00,098 --> 00:35:02,766
What's mean you is you not going out to dinner with me.

469
00:35:02,850 --> 00:35:06,353
Not until you meet
my Father, it's only proper.

470
00:35:06,437 --> 00:35:08,647
We come back
from Texas on Wednesday,

471
00:35:08,731 --> 00:35:11,316
tell him I'll meet him
that night, I promise.

472
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:12,734
Okay.

473
00:35:18,991 --> 00:35:20,992
Are they praying?

474
00:35:21,077 --> 00:35:23,829
No,
they're watching that hummingbird.

475
00:35:23,913 --> 00:35:26,540
Why?

476
00:35:26,624 --> 00:35:30,752
I told them when they see
his wings they can hit any pitch.

477
00:35:30,837 --> 00:35:33,713
You don't really believe that,
do you Father?

478
00:35:33,798 --> 00:35:36,216
They do.

479
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:39,928
On the field!
Five minutes!

480
00:35:43,975 --> 00:35:45,976
Nine of you boys
showed up

481
00:35:46,018 --> 00:35:49,980
but only one team
is going to McAllen.

482
00:35:51,941 --> 00:35:53,358
I got fourteen!

483
00:35:55,570 --> 00:35:58,071
I'll make up the two shifts next weekend.

484
00:35:58,156 --> 00:36:00,657
Two shifts?
And you'll be back next weekend?

485
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:02,159
I will be back.

486
00:36:06,330 --> 00:36:09,124
Stop filling Angel's head with crazy ideas.

487
00:36:09,208 --> 00:36:10,667
Like what?

488
00:36:10,751 --> 00:36:12,502
Like going to Texas
to play baseball.

489
00:36:12,587 --> 00:36:14,421
He needs to know
his place.

490
00:36:14,505 --> 00:36:18,049
Like where, here?
Working the furnaces at Fundidora?

491
00:36:18,134 --> 00:36:20,010
Fundidora feeds
my family.

492
00:36:20,094 --> 00:36:22,012
My Father and Grandfather worked here,

493
00:36:22,054 --> 00:36:24,181
and so will Angel.

494
00:36:24,265 --> 00:36:27,225
Well maybe Angel's got his own dreams,
you ever think about that?

495
00:36:27,310 --> 00:36:29,269
Dreams don't
build cities.

496
00:36:29,353 --> 00:36:32,147
Men and iron do.

497
00:36:37,612 --> 00:36:41,031
You make a very handsome baseball star.

498
00:36:41,115 --> 00:36:43,783
Umberto.

499
00:36:47,955 --> 00:36:49,414
Where does he
think he's going?

500
00:36:49,498 --> 00:36:51,041
To Texas with the team, remember?

501
00:36:51,083 --> 00:36:53,043
I don't remember
saying you can go.

502
00:36:53,085 --> 00:36:54,753
Umberto.

503
00:36:57,965 --> 00:37:00,217
Papa, I'm going.

504
00:37:10,728 --> 00:37:12,812
Why not?

505
00:37:12,897 --> 00:37:16,274
One less mouth to feed for a few days.

506
00:37:25,826 --> 00:37:27,410
Come on,
we're late for the bus.

507
00:37:27,495 --> 00:37:28,995
Si.

508
00:37:57,358 --> 00:38:00,402
Purpose of
your visit to the United States?

509
00:38:00,486 --> 00:38:02,362
Baseball game
in McAllen.

510
00:38:02,446 --> 00:38:05,156
That's over ten miles away.
There's no bus stop here.

511
00:38:05,241 --> 00:38:06,825
They're used
to walking.

512
00:38:06,909 --> 00:38:08,076
Hey, empty those out!

513
00:38:10,579 --> 00:38:13,957
One pair of underwear,
that's all they brought?

514
00:38:14,041 --> 00:38:15,875
They only
got one game.

515
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:18,128
See that you don't
leave no one behind.

516
00:38:18,212 --> 00:38:22,424
♫ To the miracle of the light ♫

517
00:38:22,508 --> 00:38:27,012

Friends.

524
00:38:48,159 --> 00:38:51,036

Listen up, y'all.

530
00:39:13,559 --> 00:39:15,477
Here's the field where we're going to kick some butt.

531
00:39:15,561 --> 00:39:17,270
That's right!

532
00:39:18,522 --> 00:39:20,190
What the...

533
00:39:23,027 --> 00:39:27,072
They've never seen
mowed grass before.

534
00:39:27,156 --> 00:39:29,115
Oh.

535
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:31,117
Well, if that
don't beat all.

536
00:39:33,496 --> 00:39:37,624
We going to play baseball with them?
Or use them as fertilizer?

537
00:39:37,708 --> 00:39:40,377
They'll never get
past the first game.

538
00:39:40,461 --> 00:39:41,711
Let's go.

539
00:39:44,632 --> 00:39:47,384
Angel, Enrique,
I want you to line up right here.

540
00:39:47,468 --> 00:39:51,429
Look at who we're playing.

541
00:39:51,514 --> 00:39:55,225
It will be a good warm up for the tournament.

542
00:39:55,309 --> 00:39:57,519
Now listen, you both
worked really hard,

543
00:39:57,603 --> 00:40:00,980
but only one of you can start.
You decide.

544
00:40:01,065 --> 00:40:05,944
Hey, babies,
where's your pretty girl now?

545
00:40:13,202 --> 00:40:15,578
You know what?
You start.

546
00:40:15,663 --> 00:40:17,539
For Gloria.

547
00:40:20,918 --> 00:40:23,169
Come here, boys.

548
00:40:23,254 --> 00:40:24,629
Everybody join hands.

549
00:40:24,713 --> 00:40:26,756
Holy cow, they're
holding hands.

550
00:40:26,841 --> 00:40:28,925
They're saying
a prayer.

551
00:40:29,009 --> 00:40:31,302
Lord, bless these boys,
let them come out victorious

552
00:40:31,387 --> 00:40:32,470
and get a lot
of hits, okay?

553
00:40:32,555 --> 00:40:34,180
They need to.

554
00:40:34,265 --> 00:40:37,600
Enrique Suarez, delivers,

555
00:40:37,685 --> 00:40:41,187
and Donowitz swings,
hits a high fly ball,

556
00:40:41,272 --> 00:40:45,024
Pepe Maiz is under it and makes the catch!

557
00:40:50,281 --> 00:40:51,322
Yeah.

558
00:40:55,244 --> 00:40:56,953
Hey, coach!

559
00:40:57,037 --> 00:40:58,746
Might want to remind
your boys

560
00:40:58,831 --> 00:41:01,291
there's more than one out in a baseball game.

561
00:41:01,333 --> 00:41:03,460
It's their first rodeo.
They'll catch on.

562
00:41:03,544 --> 00:41:04,794
Laughing and shouting]

563
00:41:04,837 --> 00:41:06,963
Yeah!

564
00:41:07,047 --> 00:41:09,466
Bottom of the fifth,
and Veragosa digs in.

565
00:41:09,550 --> 00:41:11,342
Oh!

566
00:41:11,427 --> 00:41:13,303
Time!
What are you kids doing?

567
00:41:13,387 --> 00:41:15,638
Take the base.

568
00:41:15,723 --> 00:41:18,016
Monterrey's Coach
Faz is coming out to the mound.

569
00:41:18,100 --> 00:41:20,894
We're playing a great game.
We're only losing by two runs.

570
00:41:20,978 --> 00:41:23,563
The only word I heard in that sentence was "losing."

571
00:41:23,647 --> 00:41:24,981
They're bigger
than us.

572
00:41:25,024 --> 00:41:26,983
Everybody's
bigger than us.

573
00:41:27,026 --> 00:41:29,861
We walked 12 miles and played five innings of baseball.

574
00:41:29,945 --> 00:41:31,905
Lucky for you
there is six innings.

575
00:41:31,989 --> 00:41:37,202
But Mr.
Faz, they're the Mexico City All Stars!

576
00:41:38,996 --> 00:41:41,998
Wrong. They're
the Yankees.

577
00:41:42,082 --> 00:41:44,250
And you're the mighty Brooklyn Dodgers.

578
00:41:44,335 --> 00:41:45,543
The mighty who?

579
00:41:45,628 --> 00:41:47,420
You heard me!
Gil Hodges,

580
00:41:47,505 --> 00:41:49,255
get back
to first base.

581
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:51,341
Duke Snider,
center field.

582
00:41:51,383 --> 00:41:54,093
Roy Campanella,
behind the plate.

583
00:41:54,178 --> 00:41:58,014
Don Newcombe,
take the mound.

584
00:42:00,809 --> 00:42:02,101
Pee Wee Reese?

585
00:42:02,186 --> 00:42:03,728
Third base.

586
00:42:11,654 --> 00:42:13,029
Strike!

587
00:42:13,072 --> 00:42:15,406
Strike Two!

588
00:42:15,491 --> 00:42:19,202
Strike Three!
Side is out.

589
00:42:19,286 --> 00:42:21,621
Top of the sixth,
Monterrey still down by two.

590
00:42:21,705 --> 00:42:25,875
Three more outs,
and Monterrey Industrials will be going home.

591
00:42:33,551 --> 00:42:39,597
Safe!

592
00:42:46,355 --> 00:42:48,731
Boy have the tables turned,

593
00:42:48,816 --> 00:42:52,860
three more outs and it'll be the
Mexico City All Stars going home.

594
00:42:55,656 --> 00:42:56,864
Hey!

595
00:43:02,788 --> 00:43:03,788
You're out!

596
00:43:11,505 --> 00:43:13,798
Two outs, and Veragosa

597
00:43:13,882 --> 00:43:17,343
is Mexico City's last hope,
he swings, he hits a high pop up.

598
00:43:17,428 --> 00:43:20,805
No. I got it.

599
00:43:20,889 --> 00:43:26,644
And Monterrey Industrial
wins their first game by 7 runs!

600
00:43:26,729 --> 00:43:29,480
Now we play for Mexico.
We'll make your team proud.

601
00:43:31,150 --> 00:43:33,109
Okay, then do it.

602
00:43:35,904 --> 00:43:37,655
Mexico All Stars!

603
00:43:37,740 --> 00:43:40,116
We are the Monterrey Industrials!
Viva Mexico!

604
00:43:40,159 --> 00:43:42,368
It's a good thing they're celebrating today,

605
00:43:42,453 --> 00:43:45,121
because tomorrow they're gonna face our Texas boys,

606
00:43:45,205 --> 00:43:48,166
for some real
American baseball.

607
00:43:48,250 --> 00:43:50,335
Alright, we got
a big game tomorrow.

608
00:43:50,419 --> 00:43:53,379
I want you boys to rest up,
get plenty of sleep.

609
00:43:55,215 --> 00:43:57,175
Oh, when did
this happen?

610
00:43:57,259 --> 00:44:01,554
Last Saturday. On the field,
I stepped on a glass.

611
00:44:01,639 --> 00:44:03,973
Oh! Does it hurt?

612
00:44:04,016 --> 00:44:05,558
Yes.

613
00:44:05,643 --> 00:44:08,019
Why didn't you
tell anybody?

614
00:44:08,103 --> 00:44:09,896
I was afraid you
wouldn't let me come.

615
00:44:09,980 --> 00:44:13,149
You're not going to be able to play on this foot.

616
00:44:13,192 --> 00:44:15,193
Then I will play
on the other.

617
00:44:15,277 --> 00:44:18,196
You'll play on the other.

618
00:44:21,575 --> 00:44:24,744
It's okay, Norberto.
You'll be all right.

619
00:44:24,828 --> 00:44:27,872
In case you wondered what those things are

620
00:44:27,956 --> 00:44:31,209
that I lugged from Monterrey,
they're called bats.

621
00:44:31,293 --> 00:44:34,253
And if you want to put numbers on that scoreboard,

622
00:44:34,338 --> 00:44:37,757
these are your tools.
Time for some hitting drills.

623
00:44:37,841 --> 00:44:40,093
Mr.
Faz, the game is in one hour.

624
00:44:40,177 --> 00:44:43,221
Well what a perfect time then.
Come on.

625
00:44:46,100 --> 00:44:47,934
Batting practice?

626
00:44:48,018 --> 00:44:50,478
Who do y'all think you're messing with here, huh?

627
00:44:52,439 --> 00:44:55,858
Disinterested.
No opinion.

628
00:44:55,901 --> 00:44:59,862
Don't care.
Request denied.

629
00:44:59,905 --> 00:45:02,031
Denied.

630
00:45:02,116 --> 00:45:04,283
One more sec. Mac.

631
00:45:04,368 --> 00:45:09,038
May provoke a nuclear
arms race in space.

632
00:45:09,081 --> 00:45:11,874
Arms race in space?

633
00:45:11,959 --> 00:45:14,460
Come on, Frankie. What's next?
Men on the moon?

634
00:45:14,545 --> 00:45:16,963
It's good stuff, Mac.
Besides, it's my day off.

635
00:45:17,047 --> 00:45:19,841
Yeah about that,
I need you to cover a Little League game.

636
00:45:19,925 --> 00:45:22,051
Our team's got a chance
at the tournament.

637
00:45:22,136 --> 00:45:24,303
A kid's baseball game? No.

638
00:45:24,388 --> 00:45:25,930
Riley's your sports writer.

639
00:45:26,014 --> 00:45:27,306
His wife's
expecting any minute.

640
00:45:27,391 --> 00:45:29,100
Well what
about Hayne?

641
00:45:29,184 --> 00:45:31,561
Got him working on the Governor Daniels story.

642
00:45:31,645 --> 00:45:34,939
Well, you got plenty of other men on your staff,
don't you?

643
00:45:35,023 --> 00:45:38,109
I hear you know more about the game than any of them.

644
00:45:38,193 --> 00:45:40,695
Ain't you named
after a ballplayer?

645
00:45:40,779 --> 00:45:42,238
I hate baseball.

646
00:45:42,322 --> 00:45:44,323
What are you,
some kind of communist?

647
00:45:44,408 --> 00:45:47,493
Yeah, you got me,
that's why I work here for next to nothing.

648
00:45:47,578 --> 00:45:49,412
Hm.

649
00:45:49,455 --> 00:45:52,665
Fine.
What's so important about this game?

650
00:45:52,750 --> 00:45:55,418
We got some boys
come up from Mexico

651
00:45:55,502 --> 00:45:57,920
thought we'd play the invasion angle,
you know,

652
00:45:57,963 --> 00:46:00,506
our boys defending what their Granddaddy's fought for.

653
00:46:00,591 --> 00:46:02,675
And what if
the Mexicans win?

654
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:05,553
5 will get you 20 those boys
ain't gonna to score a single run.

655
00:46:05,637 --> 00:46:08,473
I did not study journalism to get
stuck on this back page assignment.

656
00:46:08,557 --> 00:46:10,725
I'm not doing it,
and that's final.

657
00:46:10,809 --> 00:46:13,895
That's fine,
not everybody is cut out for the Gazette.

658
00:46:13,979 --> 00:46:18,191
Why don't you run out and get yourself
an apron, maybe, find a husband.

659
00:46:18,275 --> 00:46:21,569
You know, you say that one more time,
I will punch you in the nose.

660
00:46:21,653 --> 00:46:23,696
It's been awhile
since I fought a woman.

661
00:46:23,781 --> 00:46:27,325
We're not in the same
weight class, I don't think.

662
00:46:27,409 --> 00:46:29,619
3 o'clock.
McAllen field!

663
00:46:31,121 --> 00:46:32,955
I take that as a yes?

664
00:46:35,083 --> 00:46:37,627
Well, at least we know they didn't bring any ringers.

665
00:46:37,711 --> 00:46:40,630
Heck, they don't look
but nine or ten.

666
00:46:42,216 --> 00:46:43,591
Hey guys,
see this thing!

667
00:46:43,675 --> 00:46:45,384
Hey, come on, Jake,
give it back.

668
00:46:45,469 --> 00:46:47,136
What do
you care?

669
00:46:47,221 --> 00:46:49,180
There now, boys.

670
00:46:49,264 --> 00:46:52,141
Sportsmanship. Come on.
Come on, get in there.

671
00:46:52,226 --> 00:46:54,060
Let's go.

672
00:46:59,107 --> 00:47:01,442
Remember, you're
the pitcher.

673
00:47:01,527 --> 00:47:04,862
Birds and sky, the waters and rivers,
even the sun is going to wait,

674
00:47:04,947 --> 00:47:06,656
'till you're ready,
understand?

675
00:47:06,740 --> 00:47:07,949
Okay, Mr. Faz.

676
00:47:08,033 --> 00:47:10,701
You can
do this, Koufax.

677
00:47:10,786 --> 00:47:14,372
We're ready to get started
here on field one as Bobby Lampkin

678
00:47:14,456 --> 00:47:19,085
will lead things off for McAllen
against Monterrey's Angel Macias.

679
00:47:19,169 --> 00:47:20,169
Come on there, Billy!

680
00:47:20,254 --> 00:47:21,879
Strike!

681
00:47:21,964 --> 00:47:24,924
That's all right.
That's only one strike.

682
00:47:25,008 --> 00:47:26,467
Let's go, Billy!

683
00:47:28,178 --> 00:47:32,223
Strike three!

684
00:47:32,307 --> 00:47:34,100
That's only
one out.

685
00:47:36,562 --> 00:47:38,855
Strike three!

686
00:47:38,939 --> 00:47:42,066
Strike three!
Side out.

687
00:47:42,150 --> 00:47:44,652
That's all right!
That's only one inning boys!

688
00:47:44,736 --> 00:47:48,114
Come on boys,
let's get this one! Let's go!

689
00:47:48,198 --> 00:47:50,533
Come on, boys.

690
00:47:53,328 --> 00:47:55,329
They scored a run.

691
00:47:57,040 --> 00:48:00,001
They scored again.

692
00:48:00,085 --> 00:48:04,255
Well I'll tell you,
these Mexicans may have rolled all over the grass,

693
00:48:04,339 --> 00:48:06,591
but they sure ain't
rolling over on the field.

694
00:48:06,675 --> 00:48:09,135
Oh, tell me they're going to stop scoring runs.

695
00:48:09,219 --> 00:48:10,303
Don't worry.

696
00:48:12,556 --> 00:48:14,724
Ain't no Mexican team gonna take our flag!

697
00:48:14,808 --> 00:48:16,684
That's right!

698
00:48:18,103 --> 00:48:19,896
You can't be serious

699
00:48:19,980 --> 00:48:21,522
letting a bunch of wetbacks
get the better of you!

700
00:48:21,607 --> 00:48:23,691
We're doing
the best we can.

701
00:48:23,775 --> 00:48:26,694
Well maybe that just ain't enough.
Hey boy! I'm talking to you!

702
00:48:26,778 --> 00:48:28,487
Dad, I'm on deck!

703
00:48:28,572 --> 00:48:31,866
Remember, boys!
It ain't over 'till it's over!

704
00:48:34,411 --> 00:48:36,037
Strike three!
That's game.

705
00:48:36,121 --> 00:48:38,497
No no no! It ain't over!
This ain't over!

706
00:48:38,582 --> 00:48:40,458
It's over.

707
00:48:40,542 --> 00:48:43,669
A combination of clutch hitting,

708
00:48:43,754 --> 00:48:46,672
and impermeable defense
led Monterrey Industrial

709
00:48:46,757 --> 00:48:49,759
to an improbable
7 to 1 victory.

710
00:48:49,843 --> 00:48:52,428
So there's your article.
I'm going home.

711
00:48:52,512 --> 00:48:54,972
No,
you're going to stay with this story.

712
00:48:55,057 --> 00:48:56,849
But the home team's out.

713
00:48:56,934 --> 00:49:00,019
So? The wetbacks
winning sells more papers.

714
00:49:00,103 --> 00:49:02,396
Can't be long, just
cover them 'till they lose.

715
00:49:10,530 --> 00:49:12,323
Frankie Stevens,
McAllen Gazette.

716
00:49:12,407 --> 00:49:13,950
No thanks.

717
00:49:13,992 --> 00:49:15,952
I'm not selling them.
I'm a reporter.

718
00:49:16,036 --> 00:49:17,370
Cesar Faz.

719
00:49:19,456 --> 00:49:21,290
What are you
gawking at?

720
00:49:21,375 --> 00:49:23,918
I didn't know there were female sports reporters.

721
00:49:24,002 --> 00:49:26,379
You must be pretty unwelcome in the locker room.

722
00:49:26,463 --> 00:49:28,297
And beating the home team makes you about as popular

723
00:49:28,340 --> 00:49:29,757
as a skunk
at a lawn party.

724
00:49:29,841 --> 00:49:31,217
Well I'd rather
smell than lose.

725
00:49:31,301 --> 00:49:33,886
Maybe you can do
both tomorrow.

726
00:49:33,971 --> 00:49:35,846
You mind if I ask
them a few questions?

727
00:49:35,931 --> 00:49:37,723
They don't
speak English.

728
00:49:37,808 --> 00:49:40,184
How come the kids keep saying 'Gil Hodges'?

729
00:49:40,268 --> 00:49:42,812
And he just told those girls that he's Duke Snider.

730
00:49:42,896 --> 00:49:45,398
That's their
secret weapon.

731
00:49:49,027 --> 00:49:50,403
What is? But...

732
00:49:54,908 --> 00:49:56,283
Everybody gather round.

733
00:49:56,368 --> 00:49:58,160
We're tired,
Mr. Faz.

734
00:49:58,203 --> 00:49:59,495
Can we sleep?

735
00:49:59,538 --> 00:50:01,205
Well, if you
lose tomorrow

736
00:50:01,289 --> 00:50:03,708
you'll get plenty of sleep on the bus home,

737
00:50:03,792 --> 00:50:05,376
now gather round.

738
00:50:08,005 --> 00:50:09,922
Now base hits
to the right,

739
00:50:10,007 --> 00:50:13,592
shortstop covers
second base. Mario.

740
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:24,353
Again!

741
00:50:26,481 --> 00:50:27,565
He's out.

742
00:50:27,649 --> 00:50:29,191
Man! Come on.

743
00:50:30,485 --> 00:50:32,528
Jesus.

744
00:50:32,571 --> 00:50:35,114
Texas just can't get it going here.

745
00:50:38,577 --> 00:50:40,161
Strike three,
that's game.

746
00:50:40,245 --> 00:50:42,288
Are you kidding me?

747
00:50:42,372 --> 00:50:45,541
That's 3 straight wins for Monterrey.

748
00:50:45,625 --> 00:50:47,626
I don't envy West Waco who'll
try to stop them tomorrow.

749
00:50:48,920 --> 00:50:51,130
Why the long face?

750
00:50:51,214 --> 00:50:53,299
Our visas
have expired.

751
00:50:53,383 --> 00:50:54,842
Oh my gosh,
it's Wednesday.

752
00:50:54,926 --> 00:50:56,385
Yeah.

753
00:50:56,470 --> 00:50:59,180
She's gonna kill me.

754
00:51:16,323 --> 00:51:20,451
'The Little Giants.'
Nice touch.

755
00:51:20,535 --> 00:51:23,079
'The little giants from Monterrey beat West Waco

756
00:51:23,163 --> 00:51:26,665
'and Brownsville by the scores of 13-1,
and 6-1,

757
00:51:26,750 --> 00:51:28,751
'giving them five
straight victories.

758
00:51:28,835 --> 00:51:32,004
Now it's off to Corpus for these Mexican baseballers.'

759
00:51:32,089 --> 00:51:35,007
For someone who hates baseball
you sure have a way with it.

760
00:51:35,092 --> 00:51:37,676
You got your story, Mac,
now leave me alone.

761
00:51:37,761 --> 00:51:40,429
Hm.

762
00:51:40,514 --> 00:51:42,348
Why are you looking at me like that?

763
00:51:42,432 --> 00:51:43,933
Corpus
Christie, huh?

764
00:51:43,975 --> 00:51:45,684
No! That's where
I draw the line!

765
00:51:45,769 --> 00:51:47,645
Just 'till
they lose.

766
00:51:47,729 --> 00:51:51,315
You said that four games ago!
They're not cooperating.

767
00:51:51,399 --> 00:51:53,859
People are glued
to the sports page.

768
00:51:53,944 --> 00:51:56,362
You know, if it's so good,
why don't you cover it?

769
00:51:56,446 --> 00:51:58,447
I sign
your check.

770
00:51:58,490 --> 00:52:01,450
Remember.
Me editor. You writer.

771
00:52:01,535 --> 00:52:04,870
Consider that
a bonus.

772
00:52:04,955 --> 00:52:07,164
Don't spend it
all in one place.

773
00:52:09,292 --> 00:52:10,459
Umberto.

774
00:52:10,544 --> 00:52:11,836
Listen to this.

775
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:13,879
Steel won't wait.
Let's go.

776
00:52:13,964 --> 00:52:15,506
Let's go.

777
00:52:15,590 --> 00:52:17,716
'Corpus Christie,
Texas. August 6th.

778
00:52:17,801 --> 00:52:21,637
'The pitching duet of Enrique Suarez and Angel Macias

779
00:52:21,721 --> 00:52:23,597
'continued its
winning streak.

780
00:52:23,682 --> 00:52:26,225
'Laredo was the first
to fall in a 5-0 shut out,

781
00:52:26,309 --> 00:52:29,061
'West Columbia fared even worse,
shut out by six runs!'

782
00:52:29,146 --> 00:52:32,481
To America they go!

783
00:52:34,484 --> 00:52:35,985
Can I help you?

784
00:52:36,069 --> 00:52:38,612
Eleven tickets
to Forth Worth, please.

785
00:52:38,697 --> 00:52:41,991
I got reservations here
under the name 'West Columbia.'

786
00:52:42,075 --> 00:52:43,826
Trust me, they
won't be coming.

787
00:52:43,869 --> 00:52:46,370
Mr. Faz!

788
00:52:46,454 --> 00:52:49,081
Me and Berto have
to go to the toilet!

789
00:52:49,166 --> 00:52:53,335
I might get the restroom key, please?

790
00:52:56,131 --> 00:52:58,841
There's one about
a half mile up the road.

791
00:52:58,925 --> 00:53:02,595
You're kidding.
Well, what about that restroom out there!

792
00:53:02,679 --> 00:53:04,889
Can't your boys read?

793
00:53:04,973 --> 00:53:06,849
Hello?

794
00:53:10,103 --> 00:53:11,687
Come on.
We'll find another one.

795
00:53:11,771 --> 00:53:12,771
There's only
this one.

796
00:53:12,856 --> 00:53:14,231
It's not working.

797
00:53:14,316 --> 00:53:15,941
We saw
a man come out.

798
00:53:16,026 --> 00:53:17,776
Come on,
just go.

799
00:53:17,861 --> 00:53:19,737
This for white
people only.

800
00:53:19,821 --> 00:53:22,031

the toilet know?

Enjoy.

815
00:54:17,254 --> 00:54:19,129
You sure you don't want the chicken?

816
00:54:19,214 --> 00:54:20,631
It's my
mom's specialty.

817
00:54:20,715 --> 00:54:22,341
I'll stick
with the cheeseburger.

818
00:54:22,425 --> 00:54:24,468
Maybe Cleon wants
the fried chicken.

819
00:54:24,552 --> 00:54:27,012
Like the Mexican kids we're gonna whoop tomorrow.

820
00:54:27,097 --> 00:54:31,517
So that will be cheeseburgers, Coke,
and a side of humble pie.

821
00:54:31,601 --> 00:54:35,145
Hey,
you're killing my chicken.

822
00:54:35,230 --> 00:54:39,149
They're, uh, making mole.
It's a Mexican chocolate sauce.

823
00:54:39,234 --> 00:54:44,655
Mole, schmole,
I ain't letting them make sundaes out of my chicken.

824
00:54:44,739 --> 00:54:46,782
Hey, Father.

825
00:54:46,825 --> 00:54:50,577
Why is that kid
sitting alone?

826
00:54:50,662 --> 00:54:52,538
Well, Enrique,

827
00:54:52,622 --> 00:54:55,791
some people don't believe that we are all His children.

828
00:54:55,834 --> 00:54:57,209
What?

829
00:54:57,294 --> 00:54:59,211
Mr. Faz.

830
00:54:59,296 --> 00:55:02,214
Go ask the coach if the boy can sit with us.

831
00:55:02,299 --> 00:55:05,801
In this town,
it ain't happening. Sorry, Angel.

832
00:55:42,630 --> 00:55:43,672
What is
your name?

833
00:55:43,757 --> 00:55:45,424
Cleon.

834
00:55:45,508 --> 00:55:47,718
Cleon,
this is Mario and Norberto,

835
00:55:47,802 --> 00:55:49,928
Ricardo and Fidel.

836
00:55:50,013 --> 00:55:51,263
Milk.

837
00:55:51,348 --> 00:55:53,515
Milk. "Leche".

838
00:55:53,600 --> 00:55:54,767
"Leche." Yes.

839
00:55:54,851 --> 00:55:56,185
Yes. "Leche."

840
00:55:56,269 --> 00:55:59,355
One moment.

841
00:56:00,899 --> 00:56:03,192
It's okay, here.

842
00:56:15,997 --> 00:56:17,498
Keep it, coach.

843
00:56:17,582 --> 00:56:19,416
It's gonna cost you money.
I can't.

844
00:56:19,501 --> 00:56:21,335
Don't worry
about it.

845
00:56:21,419 --> 00:56:25,005
I'm planning on charging that Houston coach double.

846
00:56:28,259 --> 00:56:30,260
Holy Mole!
This ain't bad.

847
00:56:30,345 --> 00:56:32,429
Thank you, now.

848
00:56:39,521 --> 00:56:41,480
Come on, boys!

849
00:56:48,154 --> 00:56:51,365
♫ Well, I may be little,
And I sure ain't rich ♫

850
00:56:51,449 --> 00:56:53,325
Safe!

851
00:56:53,410 --> 00:56:57,663
♫ But like a
Louisville slugger ♫

852
00:56:57,747 --> 00:57:03,419
♫ Well, rockin', rockin'
Across the Rio Grande ♫

853
00:57:03,461 --> 00:57:08,048
♫ Yeah, rockin' across Texas,
Rockin' to the promised land ♫

854
00:57:08,133 --> 00:57:09,341
♫ Yeah! ♫

855
00:57:09,426 --> 00:57:13,303
Houston,
What happened?

856
00:57:13,388 --> 00:57:16,473
Well ladies and gentlemen,
not since the Alamo

857
00:57:16,558 --> 00:57:20,894
have the Texans suffered such a
defeat at the hands of the Mexicans.

858
00:57:20,979 --> 00:57:26,942
Pitchers Suarez and Macias cut a swath
of victory through the Lone Star State.

859
00:57:27,026 --> 00:57:29,987
Most recently
besting Houston 6-4,

860
00:57:30,071 --> 00:57:33,282
and bulldozing Waco 13-1,

861
00:57:33,366 --> 00:57:36,160
for their 8th
and 9th straight victories.

862
00:57:36,244 --> 00:57:39,413
Next up, the Southern
Regional Tournament.

863
00:57:39,497 --> 00:57:41,582
The Yellow Rose of Texas

864
00:57:41,666 --> 00:57:45,461
is smelling a little sweeter
south of the border tonight.

865
00:57:45,503 --> 00:57:47,880
Senora Macias!

866
00:57:49,632 --> 00:57:51,550
Angel won again!

867
00:57:51,634 --> 00:57:53,635
Now they're going to
Louisville, Kentucky!

868
00:57:53,678 --> 00:57:55,387
That's so far away.

869
00:57:55,472 --> 00:57:59,641
My son Enrique scored three goals!

870
00:57:59,684 --> 00:58:01,643
Runs,
Senora Suarez,

871
00:58:01,728 --> 00:58:03,729
runs not goals.

872
00:58:03,813 --> 00:58:06,315
Ah, runs, goals,
they still count!

873
00:58:27,295 --> 00:58:32,007
Okay boys,
pick a bunk and gather round.

874
00:58:32,091 --> 00:58:33,509
What's that?

875
00:58:33,551 --> 00:58:34,801
It's a telegram.

876
00:58:34,886 --> 00:58:36,220
What's a telegram?

877
00:58:36,304 --> 00:58:38,805
It's a special
written message

878
00:58:38,890 --> 00:58:41,767
and it's delivered to your door,
no matter where you are.

879
00:58:41,851 --> 00:58:44,353
What does
it say Mr. Faz?

880
00:58:44,437 --> 00:58:46,688
Well, look at this.

881
00:58:46,731 --> 00:58:49,274
It's a special invitation.

882
00:58:49,359 --> 00:58:54,071
We're gonna to get a tour of the
Louisville Slugger Bat Factory!

883
00:58:55,782 --> 00:58:58,075
Our largest bat ever,

884
00:58:58,159 --> 00:59:01,912
was made just for,
Mr. Babe Ruth.

885
00:59:01,996 --> 00:59:03,330
It all started...

886
00:59:05,792 --> 00:59:09,044
Our founder turned a bat in his carpentry shop,

887
00:59:09,128 --> 00:59:11,380
and the rest,
is history.

888
00:59:11,422 --> 00:59:12,714
I have a very
special surprise.

889
00:59:15,385 --> 00:59:19,555
We have two Major League
players here to sign their bats!

890
00:59:19,597 --> 00:59:21,014
Would you boys
like to meet them?

891
00:59:21,099 --> 00:59:22,849
Yes!

892
00:59:22,934 --> 00:59:26,228
Great!
They're with the Saint Louis Cardinals!

893
00:59:26,271 --> 00:59:29,398
Maybe you
coached them.

894
00:59:31,568 --> 00:59:32,734
Hey, guys.

895
00:59:34,779 --> 00:59:36,905
It's the Mexican.

896
00:59:36,948 --> 00:59:41,118
Hey! Bring us some towels.

897
00:59:41,202 --> 00:59:44,746
And while you are at it,
my jock strap needs a washing.

898
00:59:44,831 --> 00:59:46,957
Take these boys
to the gym.

899
00:59:47,041 --> 00:59:48,500
But the tour's not
over yet.

900
00:59:48,585 --> 00:59:50,294
No, the tour's over.

901
00:59:59,304 --> 01:00:01,013
Let's go.

902
01:00:01,097 --> 01:00:02,848
Last stop.

903
01:00:12,400 --> 01:00:14,443
That's Faz
with a Z, right?

904
01:00:14,485 --> 01:00:16,153
That's a Mexican name.

905
01:00:16,237 --> 01:00:19,990
As in coach Faz
of that Mexican team.

906
01:00:20,074 --> 01:00:24,494
Spike, get on that radio.

907
01:00:24,579 --> 01:00:27,372
I think it's time
to play ball.

908
01:00:27,457 --> 01:00:28,957
Hey, Madge.

909
01:00:29,042 --> 01:00:31,335
Father,
tell us a story.

910
01:00:32,378 --> 01:00:33,754
A story?

911
01:00:33,838 --> 01:00:35,631
Yes. A good one!

912
01:00:35,715 --> 01:00:38,342
A story!
And a good one huh?

913
01:00:38,426 --> 01:00:41,053
Okay, well which good one do you want to hear?

914
01:00:41,137 --> 01:00:42,888
The miracle of Guadalupe.

915
01:00:42,972 --> 01:00:46,016
Ah, that's
a very good story.

916
01:00:46,100 --> 01:00:49,519
Well, shortly after Montezuma's empire fell,

917
01:00:49,604 --> 01:00:52,064
a young Aztec peasant name Juan Diego

918
01:00:52,148 --> 01:00:54,066
was baptized
in Lake Texcoco.

919
01:00:54,150 --> 01:00:58,153
And one day, Juan Diego
was crossing a hill

920
01:00:58,237 --> 01:01:01,073
and the Dark Virgin,
appeared to him

921
01:01:01,157 --> 01:01:04,534
and said, "I am truly
your Merciful Mother."

922
01:01:04,619 --> 01:01:07,496
Ah,
I've heard that story before, Father.

923
01:01:07,580 --> 01:01:10,749
It was the peasant
who became a saint!

924
01:01:10,833 --> 01:01:13,960
I've heard that
fairy tale many times.

925
01:01:14,045 --> 01:01:18,674
Let me tell you something boys, it's,
it's all a lie.

926
01:01:18,758 --> 01:01:20,050
No, you're
the lie.

927
01:01:20,134 --> 01:01:22,761
Angel. Cesar
is your coach.

928
01:01:22,845 --> 01:01:26,306
Coach, Father? Coach?
I never asked to be their coach.

929
01:01:26,391 --> 01:01:28,266
That's enough Cesar.
Let's go take a walk,

930
01:01:28,351 --> 01:01:29,851
get some
fresh air, okay?

931
01:01:29,936 --> 01:01:32,896
I never asked to be
these kid's coach!

932
01:01:32,980 --> 01:01:34,231
It's okay, boys.

933
01:01:39,445 --> 01:01:42,531
Why you mock Juan Diego?
In front of the boys!

934
01:01:42,615 --> 01:01:44,282
I guess I just
don't believe

935
01:01:44,367 --> 01:01:47,536
the meek win because they're pious, Father.

936
01:01:47,620 --> 01:01:50,872
What really happened
in Saint Louis?

937
01:01:50,915 --> 01:01:56,795
I was the
clubhouse attendant.

938
01:01:56,879 --> 01:01:58,964
For years
I bit my tongue

939
01:01:59,048 --> 01:02:02,968
picking up their soiled towels,
jock straps.

940
01:02:03,052 --> 01:02:05,887
Having to sleep on the bus because they wouldn't let me

941
01:02:05,972 --> 01:02:08,890
sleep in the same
hotel as them.

942
01:02:11,269 --> 01:02:14,396
And I even took it

943
01:02:14,439 --> 01:02:17,274
when they called me
the Mexican.

944
01:02:17,358 --> 01:02:21,528
Okay. Story checks out.

945
01:02:21,612 --> 01:02:25,407
But what about your friend and the boys in there?

946
01:02:25,491 --> 01:02:26,992
They're with me.

947
01:02:27,076 --> 01:02:30,245
I'm asking about their paperwork.

948
01:02:30,329 --> 01:02:32,414
It's expired.

949
01:02:32,457 --> 01:02:35,000
Then they's
going home.

950
01:02:35,084 --> 01:02:37,961
These boys, uh,

951
01:02:38,045 --> 01:02:42,424
boys are playing in the Southern
Regionals in the next two days.

952
01:02:42,467 --> 01:02:43,842
Isn't that
right, Father?

953
01:02:43,926 --> 01:02:45,969
Yes. Two days.

954
01:02:46,053 --> 01:02:50,015
Without their visas Hope they're
fixing to play it in Mexico.

955
01:02:50,099 --> 01:02:54,102
We'll be back. 'Till then,
they under house arrest!

956
01:02:54,145 --> 01:02:56,021
Don't try
and hide them.

957
01:02:56,105 --> 01:02:59,691
Hide a Mexican baseball team in Kentucky!

958
01:02:59,776 --> 01:03:01,860
Thank you!

959
01:03:01,944 --> 01:03:03,445
First thing
in the morning,

960
01:03:03,529 --> 01:03:05,447
I'll call the embassy in Mexico City.

961
01:03:05,490 --> 01:03:07,240
They're not going
to care Father.

962
01:03:07,325 --> 01:03:09,576
Well you have
to have a little faith.

963
01:03:09,660 --> 01:03:11,703
Maybe it's better
this way, then,

964
01:03:11,788 --> 01:03:13,830
we just go
home undefeated.

965
01:03:13,915 --> 01:03:15,290
What makes you think they are going to lose?

966
01:03:15,374 --> 01:03:17,042
All dreams
come to an end.

967
01:03:17,126 --> 01:03:19,878
Yeah yeah.
Go say goodnight to the boys.

968
01:03:19,962 --> 01:03:22,881
All right? And try not
to throw up.

969
01:03:33,810 --> 01:03:36,520
Give me five minutes to say goodbye to the Mexicans.

970
01:03:36,604 --> 01:03:41,358
You're gonna be Biloxi's most valuable player.

971
01:03:41,442 --> 01:03:42,984
The stick!

972
01:03:45,029 --> 01:03:46,613
Captain Slater come in.

973
01:03:46,697 --> 01:03:48,156
Hey, Madge.

974
01:03:48,241 --> 01:03:49,991
Let the Mexicans go.

975
01:03:50,076 --> 01:03:51,493
What? Hold...

976
01:03:51,577 --> 01:03:53,912
I just got a wire.

977
01:03:53,996 --> 01:03:57,040
Hey, Captain Slater,
got to let them go.

978
01:03:57,124 --> 01:04:01,253
Are you kidding me?
I'm the police chief of this here county,

979
01:04:01,337 --> 01:04:03,839
who is gonna
tell me what to do?

980
01:04:03,923 --> 01:04:08,593
Secretary of State,
Washington DC.

981
01:04:08,678 --> 01:04:11,763
Visas extended for 9 players

982
01:04:11,848 --> 01:04:14,015
and only one coach,
this is ridiculous.

983
01:04:14,058 --> 01:04:16,184
I have a flock to tend to
back in Monterrey,

984
01:04:16,269 --> 01:04:18,395
I can do more good
for the team back there.

985
01:04:18,479 --> 01:04:19,896
What am I gonna do?

986
01:04:19,981 --> 01:04:23,191
You're their coach.
Coach them!

987
01:04:23,234 --> 01:04:25,277
I must say my
goodbyes to them.

988
01:04:25,361 --> 01:04:28,530
Don't, uh,
don't tell them about me and Saint Louis.

989
01:04:28,573 --> 01:04:29,906
I won't tell them.

990
01:04:29,991 --> 01:04:30,991
Thanks.

991
01:04:31,075 --> 01:04:35,078
Because you will.

992
01:04:35,162 --> 01:04:37,372
Boys, come,
gather round.

993
01:04:42,044 --> 01:04:45,088
Whoa, hold it boy.

994
01:04:45,172 --> 01:04:46,673
You got a tell.

995
01:04:46,757 --> 01:04:48,300
Tell who what?

996
01:04:48,384 --> 01:04:51,928
A tell, you're giving
your pitches away.

997
01:04:52,013 --> 01:04:55,849
Fastball!

998
01:04:55,933 --> 01:04:59,394
Hey, hey,
what don't you mind your own business, huh?

999
01:04:59,437 --> 01:05:01,271
Last thing I need
is my boys

1000
01:05:01,355 --> 01:05:04,900
taking baseball advice from some old grounds-keeper.

1001
01:05:04,984 --> 01:05:07,485
All right,
throw the ball like I told you!

1002
01:05:07,570 --> 01:05:10,864
Curveball.

1003
01:05:10,948 --> 01:05:15,452
We're about to kick off the
Southern Regional here in Louisville.

1004
01:05:15,536 --> 01:05:16,912
Play ball!

1005
01:05:18,789 --> 01:05:21,499
Monterrey! Where's
your lead off hitter?

1006
01:05:21,584 --> 01:05:25,337
Hey,
what the blazes is going on here ump?

1007
01:05:25,421 --> 01:05:28,423
Monterrey Coach,
come here.

1008
01:05:28,507 --> 01:05:32,427
You know I don't know how
y'all start a game down there in Mexico,

1009
01:05:32,511 --> 01:05:34,971
never been there,
never wanted to go,

1010
01:05:35,056 --> 01:05:37,641
But I'll tell you what,
we just got us two words here,

1011
01:05:37,725 --> 01:05:40,060
'play' and 'ball' and he's already said them.

1012
01:05:40,144 --> 01:05:41,561
I don't suppose,
you have a priest?

1013
01:05:41,646 --> 01:05:43,146
Why, somebody dying?

1014
01:05:43,230 --> 01:05:45,440
They won't play
without their blessing.

1015
01:05:45,524 --> 01:05:47,901
Hell,
ain't that something?

1016
01:05:47,985 --> 01:05:49,945
Your fixing to forfeit.

1017
01:05:50,029 --> 01:05:53,615
Look, um,
why don't you just go talk some reason into them.

1018
01:05:53,699 --> 01:05:55,116
Reason with these guys?

1019
01:05:55,201 --> 01:05:57,369
See what
you can do.

1020
01:05:57,453 --> 01:05:59,287
No foolin', boys,
you want to lose and go home,

1021
01:05:59,330 --> 01:06:01,331
I'm not going
to argue with you.

1022
01:06:01,415 --> 01:06:03,792
You lost our priest,
you fix it.

1023
01:06:17,264 --> 01:06:18,473
They won't budge.

1024
01:06:18,516 --> 01:06:19,975
Well, there you have it,

1025
01:06:20,017 --> 01:06:23,478
rule 12 paragraph
nine, forfeit.

1026
01:06:23,521 --> 01:06:26,356
I got a nephew that's a minister,

1027
01:06:26,440 --> 01:06:28,566
does that count?

1028
01:06:28,651 --> 01:06:31,903
Doesn't look to me like you got a
kid on this team, grounds-keeper.

1029
01:06:31,988 --> 01:06:34,364
Now this is a steaming pile, ump.

1030
01:06:34,448 --> 01:06:36,700
Now this is baseball,
this is America's game,

1031
01:06:36,784 --> 01:06:38,076
not some church service.

1032
01:06:38,160 --> 01:06:39,661
Coach,
what's your name?

1033
01:06:39,745 --> 01:06:41,204
Hicks, Sam Hicks.

1034
01:06:41,288 --> 01:06:42,998
'Today in Louisville,

1035
01:06:43,040 --> 01:06:45,875
'Coach Sam Hicks

1036
01:06:45,960 --> 01:06:49,587
'declares baseball
bigger than God.

1037
01:06:49,672 --> 01:06:52,841
I did not say that,
you know dad-gam well I didn't say that,

1038
01:06:52,925 --> 01:06:57,595
but rule 12, paragraph 9,
must field at least 8 players or forfeit!

1039
01:06:57,680 --> 01:06:59,222
Now I demand
that you...

1040
01:06:59,306 --> 01:07:01,933
You ain't demanding
nothing on my field!

1041
01:07:02,018 --> 01:07:04,144
Now you take
a time out!

1042
01:07:04,228 --> 01:07:05,270
Now.

1043
01:07:05,354 --> 01:07:06,646
I'm demanding.

1044
01:07:06,731 --> 01:07:09,190
Go get that
nephew of yours.

1045
01:07:09,233 --> 01:07:12,444
Let's try and have
ourselves a ball game.

1046
01:07:12,528 --> 01:07:16,865
Hey, so what happened to the
priest you were traveling with?

1047
01:07:16,949 --> 01:07:19,367
I told him not to drink the water here.

1048
01:07:19,410 --> 01:07:21,369
Any particular blessing?

1049
01:07:21,454 --> 01:07:22,912
108th Psalm.

1050
01:07:22,997 --> 01:07:25,373
108, 108, 108,

1051
01:07:25,458 --> 01:07:27,625
'You're loving kindness,

1052
01:07:27,710 --> 01:07:30,462
is great
above the heavens,

1053
01:07:30,546 --> 01:07:33,465
with God, we will
gain the victory

1054
01:07:33,549 --> 01:07:35,925
and he will trample
down our enemies.'

1055
01:07:36,010 --> 01:07:37,927
Come on. Come on.

1056
01:07:38,012 --> 01:07:41,056
Coach, were your boys really going to forfeit this game?

1057
01:07:41,140 --> 01:07:43,016
Oh, yeah.

1058
01:07:43,100 --> 01:07:46,728
Whoo whee!
Now that's what I call a dedicated flock.

1059
01:08:10,586 --> 01:08:11,753
Strike three!

1060
01:08:11,837 --> 01:08:13,004
Fastball!

1061
01:08:14,882 --> 01:08:16,758
Thank you.

1062
01:08:16,842 --> 01:08:17,926
Okay.

1063
01:08:41,158 --> 01:08:45,120
Biloxi, go, Biloxi!

1064
01:08:47,957 --> 01:08:49,791
We would have
won this game

1065
01:08:49,875 --> 01:08:52,460
if it wouldn't have been for that nosy colored guy.

1066
01:08:52,503 --> 01:08:56,214
He wasn't the one who scored 13 runs against us.

1067
01:09:14,483 --> 01:09:15,859
Pedro,

1068
01:09:15,943 --> 01:09:17,318
my son.

1069
01:09:35,796 --> 01:09:37,255
Angel.

1070
01:09:37,339 --> 01:09:39,382
What have I done?

1071
01:09:42,970 --> 01:09:45,680
Ugh!

1072
01:09:45,764 --> 01:09:48,600
You have given your hearts and your prayers

1073
01:09:48,684 --> 01:09:50,185
and now I must ask
you to give even more

1074
01:09:50,227 --> 01:09:52,478
so that our boys
can continue.

1075
01:09:52,563 --> 01:09:56,608
Whatever you can spare will make a difference.
Thank you.

1076
01:10:38,275 --> 01:10:44,948
With runners on first and second,
who takes the cut off to home?

1077
01:10:45,032 --> 01:10:46,532
Good to see you again, Cesar.

1078
01:10:46,617 --> 01:10:48,451
Good to see
you, Clarence

1079
01:10:48,535 --> 01:10:49,911
I'd like for you to meet my wife, Mrs.
Rose Bell.

1080
01:10:49,995 --> 01:10:52,455
Pleasure, Misses
Rose Bell.

1081
01:10:52,539 --> 01:10:55,792
Likewise.
Why don't you have them bring me their uniforms

1082
01:10:55,876 --> 01:10:57,627
and I'll take them
home and wash them.

1083
01:11:00,214 --> 01:11:03,258
I have 7 brothers,
and I done raised 5 boys of my own,

1084
01:11:03,342 --> 01:11:06,636
y'all ain't got nothing I haven't seen before.

1085
01:11:06,720 --> 01:11:08,805
Don't make me count to three up here.

1086
01:11:11,141 --> 01:11:14,185
That's right now.

1087
01:11:14,270 --> 01:11:16,771
Come on now.
Okay, that's right!

1088
01:11:16,855 --> 01:11:19,899
Bring me these dirty clothes so
I can take them home for you.

1089
01:11:19,984 --> 01:11:22,777
There you go. Okay now.
I'm going to take these home

1090
01:11:22,861 --> 01:11:24,988
and I'm going to wash them for you.
Get that for me baby.

1091
01:11:25,072 --> 01:11:26,614
Thank you.

1092
01:11:26,699 --> 01:11:28,741
You're welcome, baby.

1093
01:11:28,826 --> 01:11:33,037
Now, can anybody tell me who takes the cutoff to home

1094
01:11:33,122 --> 01:11:36,374
with runners both on
first and second?

1095
01:11:36,458 --> 01:11:39,002
At least he can't make us go outside and run laps.

1096
01:11:53,726 --> 01:11:55,310
Play ball.

1097
01:11:55,394 --> 01:11:57,603
Don't try and win the game
with one swing.

1098
01:11:57,688 --> 01:12:00,231
The goal is to make the rally last as long as possible,
you got that.

1099
01:12:00,316 --> 01:12:02,191
Like kissing a girl.

1100
01:12:02,276 --> 01:12:04,319
Except, don't
close your eyes.

1101
01:12:08,157 --> 01:12:11,534
You think you know a lot about women, huh?

1102
01:12:11,618 --> 01:12:13,995
I know that you have to try harder to win Maria.

1103
01:12:15,414 --> 01:12:16,914
Strike one.

1104
01:12:16,999 --> 01:12:21,919
I stood her up twice,
it's... It's over.

1105
01:12:22,004 --> 01:12:23,755
Strike two.

1106
01:12:23,839 --> 01:12:27,550
That's two strikes,
you get three.

1107
01:12:27,634 --> 01:12:29,844
Love ain't like baseball.

1108
01:12:29,928 --> 01:12:33,431
Yes, it is!

1109
01:12:35,934 --> 01:12:38,644
Oh!

1110
01:12:38,729 --> 01:12:42,440
Suarez sure got a hold of that one.

1111
01:12:42,524 --> 01:12:43,566
Oh!

1112
01:12:43,650 --> 01:12:45,777
Go Enrique!

1113
01:12:47,613 --> 01:12:48,821
Safe!

1114
01:13:02,544 --> 01:13:03,544
Strike.

1115
01:13:06,548 --> 01:13:07,423
Strike!

1116
01:13:09,593 --> 01:13:12,053
It all comes down to clean up hitter

1117
01:13:12,137 --> 01:13:15,056
Clyde Conner, with two
outs in the last inning.

1118
01:13:15,140 --> 01:13:17,809
Clyde's a switch hitter,
he's been highly effective

1119
01:13:17,893 --> 01:13:20,520
batting lefty against
right-handed pitchers.

1120
01:13:20,604 --> 01:13:24,107
Well, I'll be darned,
that there kid is one of those amphibians.

1121
01:13:24,191 --> 01:13:28,027
You mean abydocktrias, stupid.

1122
01:13:28,112 --> 01:13:30,863
Well,
Clyde hits just as good from either side.

1123
01:13:30,948 --> 01:13:32,949
Come on Clyde,
get it done.

1124
01:13:45,462 --> 01:13:46,671
Batter,

1125
01:13:46,755 --> 01:13:49,090
pick a side.

1126
01:13:49,174 --> 01:13:50,633
Yes, sir.

1127
01:14:00,519 --> 01:14:03,187
Monterrey's going to the World Series!

1128
01:14:03,272 --> 01:14:05,481
Pepe,
you didn't make your cut off in the sixth.

1129
01:14:05,566 --> 01:14:06,732
But the run
didn't score.

1130
01:14:06,817 --> 01:14:08,609
Yeah, but
it could've.

1131
01:14:08,694 --> 01:14:11,195
And Enrique,
you back up your plays to the plate.

1132
01:14:11,280 --> 01:14:13,656
Berto you make sure
you cover Ricardo.

1133
01:14:13,740 --> 01:14:16,784
You mean I got to run with the batter to first base?

1134
01:14:16,869 --> 01:14:19,036
You know,
Berto just gave me an idea.

1135
01:14:19,121 --> 01:14:20,955
Let me guess,
ten laps.

1136
01:14:21,039 --> 01:14:23,374
Ten laps and an hour of fielding!

1137
01:14:23,459 --> 01:14:25,835
Go on! Move it!
Go on, Ricardo.

1138
01:14:27,838 --> 01:14:30,423
Looks like you boys are on the way to Williamsport.

1139
01:14:30,507 --> 01:14:33,342
I meant to thank you for working
with my boys yesterday.

1140
01:14:33,427 --> 01:14:35,887
You must learn a lot about baseball working here.

1141
01:14:35,971 --> 01:14:39,682
My uncle is Cool Papa Bell.
He played for the Monarchs in the Negro Leagues.

1142
01:14:39,766 --> 01:14:42,602
The fastest man in baseball.
He coached Jackie Robinson.

1143
01:14:42,686 --> 01:14:44,479
He coached Jackie Robinson?

1144
01:14:44,563 --> 01:14:47,023
Yeah, we roomed together when we was on the road.

1145
01:14:47,107 --> 01:14:50,234
Jackie said my uncle was so fast,
when he turned off the light,

1146
01:14:50,319 --> 01:14:53,654
Cool Papa was in the bed
before it got dark.

1147
01:14:53,697 --> 01:14:57,241
You know, this is the best-coached
team I've seen since the Monarchs.

1148
01:14:57,326 --> 01:14:58,618
This is for you.

1149
01:14:58,702 --> 01:15:00,661
What's this?

1150
01:15:00,746 --> 01:15:03,039
We took up a collection in the church,

1151
01:15:03,123 --> 01:15:05,458
that's for you
and the boys.

1152
01:15:05,542 --> 01:15:07,251
Why are you doing this?

1153
01:15:07,336 --> 01:15:09,420
Well lets
just say that, uh,

1154
01:15:09,505 --> 01:15:13,674
you and I both know what it means to be underdogs.

1155
01:15:20,557 --> 01:15:24,227
My Grandmother always
told me that God works his miracles

1156
01:15:24,311 --> 01:15:27,438
through the meek, not the mighty.
The Monterrey Industrials

1157
01:15:27,523 --> 01:15:31,359
are proving her right.
But you won't see me in church praying this week,

1158
01:15:31,443 --> 01:15:35,988
you'll see me at Williamsport,
Pennsylvania for the Little League World Series.

1159
01:15:36,073 --> 01:15:37,448
You got that Mac?

1160
01:15:37,533 --> 01:15:40,034
I got it.
Great job, kid.

1161
01:15:40,118 --> 01:15:41,953
Riley'll take it from here.

1162
01:15:42,037 --> 01:15:44,121
No.

1163
01:15:44,206 --> 01:15:48,292
What? We must have
a bad connection.

1164
01:15:48,377 --> 01:15:50,419
I said no, Mac.

1165
01:15:50,504 --> 01:15:52,129
You're out of your league.

1166
01:15:52,214 --> 01:15:54,423
Maybe but this
is my story.

1167
01:15:54,508 --> 01:15:57,969
Riley is a sports writer,
you hate baseball, remember?

1168
01:15:58,053 --> 01:16:01,055
Well you tell Riley to just stay
home and enjoy his newborn.

1169
01:16:01,139 --> 01:16:04,392
How bout' you tell him yourself
when you get back to the office?!

1170
01:16:04,476 --> 01:16:07,144
Clarence,
where you going in that old thing?

1171
01:16:07,229 --> 01:16:09,730
I heard there was a team that
needed a lift to Williamsport.

1172
01:16:09,815 --> 01:16:12,275
That's so nice of you,
I don't know if we'd be able to pay you.

1173
01:16:12,359 --> 01:16:16,237
Well, you just keep your boys from throwing
up on my bus and we'll call it even.

1174
01:16:16,321 --> 01:16:19,615
Williamsport, Pennsylvania.
You ain't going on my dime.

1175
01:16:19,700 --> 01:16:22,118
Oh, I'll find a way.

1176
01:16:22,202 --> 01:16:23,661
Mighty long walk in heels.

1177
01:16:23,745 --> 01:16:26,747
I was, uh, thinking
of taking a bus.

1178
01:16:26,790 --> 01:16:28,249
Bus? What bus...

1179
01:16:37,843 --> 01:16:40,803
Now I don't mind you getting beat here, okay?

1180
01:16:40,887 --> 01:16:42,597
But don't lose
up here. Got it?

1181
01:16:42,681 --> 01:16:43,681
Yes.

1182
01:16:43,765 --> 01:16:44,765
Pepper time!

1183
01:16:44,850 --> 01:16:46,183
Ricardo!

1184
01:16:46,268 --> 01:16:47,852
Ugh. What...

1185
01:16:47,936 --> 01:16:50,229
The unexpected play
at the unexpected time!

1186
01:16:50,314 --> 01:16:52,481
Uh-oh.
At least he can't make us

1187
01:16:52,566 --> 01:16:53,608
run laps on a bus!

1188
01:16:59,281 --> 01:17:02,116
♫ Now, if you love me,
Let's please don't tease ♫

1189
01:17:02,200 --> 01:17:05,786
♫ If I can hold you
Then let me squeeze ♫

1190
01:17:05,829 --> 01:17:08,331
♫ My heart
Goes round and round ♫

1191
01:17:08,415 --> 01:17:13,210
♫ You leave me ♫

1192
01:17:13,295 --> 01:17:15,546
♫♫ Breathless ♫♫

1193
01:17:15,631 --> 01:17:17,131
American are so rich.

1194
01:17:17,215 --> 01:17:18,633
They throw away
their money.

1195
01:17:18,717 --> 01:17:20,426
It's wishing well.

1196
01:17:20,510 --> 01:17:21,636
You throw in money,
and you make a wish.

1197
01:17:21,720 --> 01:17:23,179
It's silly.

1198
01:17:23,263 --> 01:17:25,806
What do you think
she's wishing for?

1199
01:17:25,891 --> 01:17:29,185
Oh, I don't know, health, kids,
could be a bunch of things.

1200
01:17:29,269 --> 01:17:30,311
Love!

1201
01:17:30,395 --> 01:17:31,729
Perhaps.

1202
01:17:31,813 --> 01:17:33,939
Maybe you could
wish for Maria.

1203
01:17:34,024 --> 01:17:37,193
Look you're not going to get
something just cause you wish for it.

1204
01:17:37,277 --> 01:17:39,403
But it doesn't
hurt to try.

1205
01:17:45,327 --> 01:17:48,371
What are these for?

1206
01:17:48,455 --> 01:17:51,666
All the teams have to wear the
uniform representing their region,

1207
01:17:51,750 --> 01:17:53,668
there are no exceptions.

1208
01:17:53,710 --> 01:17:57,171
I think they're going to prefer the ones they came in.

1209
01:17:57,255 --> 01:17:59,090
Mr.
Faz, look at this.

1210
01:18:02,010 --> 01:18:04,887
Yeah, all right,
they can wear the one they came in.

1211
01:18:08,433 --> 01:18:11,102
Gentlemen,
take your seats please.

1212
01:18:11,186 --> 01:18:13,479
If you want to get
settled in, we'll begin.

1213
01:18:13,563 --> 01:18:16,148
This has truly become
an international series,

1214
01:18:16,233 --> 01:18:20,236
and we'd like to welcome the gentlemen
representing the Mexican delegation.

1215
01:18:25,450 --> 01:18:27,868
Alrighty then,
any questions, gentlemen?

1216
01:18:27,953 --> 01:18:29,745
Did the teams pass
their physicals?

1217
01:18:29,830 --> 01:18:32,206
Dr. Archer has finished
his examinations

1218
01:18:32,290 --> 01:18:34,625
and given them all
a clean bill of health.

1219
01:18:34,710 --> 01:18:36,544
Even the Mexican team?

1220
01:18:36,628 --> 01:18:39,338
Well they do weigh
about 35 pounds less,

1221
01:18:39,423 --> 01:18:41,549
and stand about six
inches shorter,

1222
01:18:41,633 --> 01:18:45,428
but in every other way,
they're are the same as the American kids.

1223
01:18:45,512 --> 01:18:50,850
Coach Faz, are your boys concerned about
how much larger the American kids are?

1224
01:18:50,934 --> 01:18:52,977
Well, let me
ask them.

1225
01:19:06,241 --> 01:19:10,953
Cesar) He says, 'We're only here to play them,
not carry them.'

1226
01:19:11,037 --> 01:19:14,290
Now as you guessed,
today's game is postponed,

1227
01:19:14,374 --> 01:19:19,003
but our local weatherman has assured
us a good day for baseball tomorrow.

1228
01:19:19,087 --> 01:19:23,007
Now the semi finals,
will be played in a double-header,

1229
01:19:23,091 --> 01:19:26,552
the new schedule,
you'll find it inside your programs.

1230
01:19:29,639 --> 01:19:32,850
Is it possible to switch the games,
my boys can't play at 2:30.

1231
01:19:32,934 --> 01:19:34,518
Well, why not?

1232
01:19:34,603 --> 01:19:37,897
It's their siesta time.

1233
01:19:40,275 --> 01:19:42,735
Any more questions?
Yes, sir.

1234
01:19:44,696 --> 01:19:47,490
Everybody knows what time Mexicans take their siestas!

1235
01:19:47,574 --> 01:19:49,116
They just trying...

1236
01:19:49,201 --> 01:19:50,951
I heard all that stuff in there, too.

1237
01:19:50,994 --> 01:19:53,788
You just got
to let that go.

1238
01:19:53,872 --> 01:19:56,415
You know my best friend Jose was killed in lwo Jima.

1239
01:19:56,500 --> 01:19:59,043
Saved an entire platoon,
but it wasn't good enough.

1240
01:19:59,127 --> 01:20:02,296
They buried him in his hometown
cemetery because he wasn't white.

1241
01:20:02,339 --> 01:20:04,632
My daddy was lynched.

1242
01:20:04,716 --> 01:20:06,967
You can't run away
from that Cesar.

1243
01:20:07,010 --> 01:20:10,679
But also, you can't pick a fight every
time somebody calls you a name.

1244
01:20:10,764 --> 01:20:14,558
Now you and your boys
are making a difference.

1245
01:20:14,643 --> 01:20:16,060
Yeah, for a few
parents at home.

1246
01:20:16,144 --> 01:20:17,812
Even to the white folks.

1247
01:20:17,896 --> 01:20:19,563
It was a pleasure gentlemen.

1248
01:20:19,648 --> 01:20:21,649
Leaving so early,
Ms. Frankie?

1249
01:20:21,691 --> 01:20:24,235
Got a story to work on,
it's about Jim Crow and baseball.

1250
01:20:24,319 --> 01:20:26,195
That'll ruffle
a few feathers.

1251
01:20:26,279 --> 01:20:28,072
I bet the editors will have
something to say about that.

1252
01:20:28,156 --> 01:20:30,366
Already has.
I told him he prints this story,

1253
01:20:30,450 --> 01:20:32,243
or I'll see to it
somebody else does.

1254
01:20:32,327 --> 01:20:34,662
Good luck with that
story Miss Frankie.

1255
01:20:34,704 --> 01:20:39,458
Don't even say it.

1256
01:20:42,504 --> 01:20:45,923
Cesar, you should start Angel tomorrow.
He's the stronger pitcher.

1257
01:20:46,007 --> 01:20:47,883
Yeah, well it's
Enrique's turn.

1258
01:20:47,968 --> 01:20:50,678
Cesar, no foreign team has every made it to the finals.

1259
01:20:50,762 --> 01:20:52,763
If he wins,
they'll make history.

1260
01:20:52,848 --> 01:20:55,766
You'll be guaranteed a trophy.
Angel is your best chance.

1261
01:20:55,851 --> 01:20:59,937
Yeah, well,
we've been doing pretty good on this rotation. Thanks.

1262
01:21:00,021 --> 01:21:02,231
Maybe we didn't make
ourselves clear.

1263
01:21:02,315 --> 01:21:05,526
We're not asking you.

1264
01:21:16,496 --> 01:21:20,124
I'm thinking
about starting Angel.

1265
01:21:20,208 --> 01:21:22,042
Why, Mr. Faz?

1266
01:21:22,127 --> 01:21:27,381
Well, no foreign team has ever made it to the final,

1267
01:21:27,465 --> 01:21:30,134
so I just, uh,
want to give it our...

1268
01:21:30,218 --> 01:21:31,510
Best?

1269
01:21:35,473 --> 01:21:38,475
Look this is my team,
and you'll do what I tell you to do.

1270
01:21:38,560 --> 01:21:41,562
This is isn't
about feelings Enrique!

1271
01:21:41,646 --> 01:21:43,898
It's all
about feelings.

1272
01:21:43,982 --> 01:21:46,901
Don't tell me
you, too.

1273
01:21:55,619 --> 01:21:58,245
My jock strap needs a washing.

1274
01:21:58,288 --> 01:22:00,414
It's not about feelings.

1275
01:22:00,498 --> 01:22:03,834
It's all about feelings.

1276
01:22:03,919 --> 01:22:06,921
Hey, Chico,
bring us some towels.

1277
01:22:07,005 --> 01:22:09,298
You don't like picking up towels?

1278
01:22:09,382 --> 01:22:12,676
Maybe you'd be more comfortable
picking lettuce out of a field.

1279
01:22:17,474 --> 01:22:19,183
Welcome to Williamsport

1280
01:22:19,267 --> 01:22:22,269
and the home of Little
League baseball,

1281
01:22:22,354 --> 01:22:24,813
where the opening game
of the 1957 World Series

1282
01:22:24,898 --> 01:22:28,150
between Monterrey Industrials
and the Power House Sluggers

1283
01:22:28,234 --> 01:22:30,110
from Bridgeport, Connecticut.

1284
01:22:33,573 --> 01:22:35,950
Baltazar right field.
Pepe left field.

1285
01:22:35,992 --> 01:22:38,118
Mario second base.

1286
01:22:38,161 --> 01:22:41,914
Angel shortstop.

1287
01:22:41,998 --> 01:22:44,708
Enrique.

1288
01:22:44,793 --> 01:22:46,335
Well what are
you looking at?

1289
01:22:46,419 --> 01:22:48,128
Get out there
and start warming up.

1290
01:22:48,213 --> 01:22:49,797
Yes, Mr. Faz.

1291
01:22:49,881 --> 01:22:51,840
I'm pitching!
I'm pitching!

1292
01:23:00,642 --> 01:23:03,185
Cesar, I thought
we told you...

1293
01:23:03,269 --> 01:23:05,980
When I die and you're coach,
you get to make the line up.

1294
01:23:06,022 --> 01:23:08,023
You put in Angel
or we will...

1295
01:23:08,108 --> 01:23:10,734
You'll what? You'll
get me fired? Too late.

1296
01:23:10,819 --> 01:23:13,237
Or we will tell
them the truth.

1297
01:23:13,321 --> 01:23:15,656
Yeah, we know
about Saint Louis.

1298
01:23:15,699 --> 01:23:18,909
Cesar, think
of the children, huh?

1299
01:23:18,994 --> 01:23:20,953
I see.

1300
01:23:21,037 --> 01:23:25,124
So you better go tell the umpire there's been a change.

1301
01:23:28,962 --> 01:23:31,005
Hey, ump.

1302
01:23:31,089 --> 01:23:34,341
What are those fans
doing on the field?

1303
01:23:34,384 --> 01:23:37,803
Hey,
anybody not in uniform clear the field immediately.

1304
01:23:37,887 --> 01:23:40,931
You don't understand,
we are with the Mexican delegation.

1305
01:23:41,016 --> 01:23:44,059
Well,
I don't care if you are with Elvis Presley.

1306
01:23:44,144 --> 01:23:45,561
Clear my field!

1307
01:23:52,027 --> 01:23:55,195
They're right, you know.
You should pitch Angel today.

1308
01:23:55,238 --> 01:23:56,447
You!

1309
01:23:56,531 --> 01:23:58,032
Always go
with your best.

1310
01:23:58,074 --> 01:23:59,825
What are you
doing here?

1311
01:23:59,909 --> 01:24:01,410
It's baseball.

1312
01:24:01,494 --> 01:24:04,830
It's a World Series,
only in America.

1313
01:24:04,914 --> 01:24:07,416
Well, I'd say it's good
to see you, but it isn't.

1314
01:24:07,500 --> 01:24:10,127
Oh, come on, Cesar,
its water under the bridge.

1315
01:24:10,211 --> 01:24:11,628
Some things never change.

1316
01:24:11,713 --> 01:24:13,547
You took everything
too personally,

1317
01:24:13,631 --> 01:24:15,049
pro baseball
is business.

1318
01:24:15,133 --> 01:24:16,717
Really? What business
got you here?

1319
01:24:16,801 --> 01:24:18,218
You.

1320
01:24:18,303 --> 01:24:20,721
No, I'm here
to scout you.

1321
01:24:20,805 --> 01:24:22,181
You're causing
quite a stir

1322
01:24:22,265 --> 01:24:24,308
and boys upstairs
figured anybody

1323
01:24:24,392 --> 01:24:25,893
could bring these kids this far
might deserve a second look.

1324
01:24:25,977 --> 01:24:27,561
And?

1325
01:24:27,604 --> 01:24:31,231
And we'll see if you
can win a big game.

1326
01:24:31,274 --> 01:24:33,734
Go get'em, firecracker.

1327
01:24:33,777 --> 01:24:36,320
All right everybody,
inside the dug out.

1328
01:24:43,078 --> 01:24:45,829
Everybody, gather round.

1329
01:24:45,914 --> 01:24:50,459
I got a confession
I want to make you boys.

1330
01:24:50,543 --> 01:24:55,380
In Saint Louis, I, uh,

1331
01:24:55,465 --> 01:24:59,927
in Saint Louis I,
I wasn't exactly, uh, a coach.

1332
01:25:00,011 --> 01:25:02,930
I uh,

1333
01:25:03,014 --> 01:25:06,475
wasn't even
an assistant coach.

1334
01:25:06,559 --> 01:25:12,106
I was, uh,
I was a towel boy.

1335
01:25:18,780 --> 01:25:20,864
We knew.

1336
01:25:23,618 --> 01:25:26,954
You knew?

1337
01:25:27,038 --> 01:25:28,455
Yeah.

1338
01:25:28,540 --> 01:25:30,457
Can we play
baseball now?

1339
01:25:30,500 --> 01:25:33,460
Yeah. Let's play some baseball.
Balt. Grab your bat!

1340
01:25:38,258 --> 01:25:41,135
Top of the sixth and it's deadlocked 1 to 1.

1341
01:25:41,219 --> 01:25:44,471
Baltazar slaps one
into right.

1342
01:25:46,391 --> 01:25:48,684
Ruiz rounds second.

1343
01:25:48,768 --> 01:25:52,396
Coach Faz tries to hold him but
Ruiz takes off for the plate.

1344
01:25:54,482 --> 01:25:55,816
Safe!

1345
01:25:58,403 --> 01:25:59,736
Who told you to do that?

1346
01:25:59,821 --> 01:26:00,737
You did.

1347
01:26:00,822 --> 01:26:01,822
No, I didn't.

1348
01:26:01,906 --> 01:26:03,532
Yes, you did.

1349
01:26:03,616 --> 01:26:07,828
The unexpected play
at the unexpected time.

1350
01:26:07,871 --> 01:26:11,999
Monterrey,
struggling to hold on to a one run lead in the last inning.

1351
01:26:12,041 --> 01:26:15,460
With a runner in scoring position,
a hit here could win it for Bridgeport.

1352
01:26:15,545 --> 01:26:18,964
Enrique winds up,
and here's...

1353
01:26:19,048 --> 01:26:21,049
Why'd you turn off the radio?

1354
01:26:21,134 --> 01:26:23,260
We're working!
It's the World Series!

1355
01:26:23,344 --> 01:26:25,012
In America!
My boy is pitching!

1356
01:26:25,096 --> 01:26:28,015
I don't care.
Get back to work.

1357
01:26:28,099 --> 01:26:31,935
Jimmy Carterola steps in with
two outs with runners on second and third.

1358
01:26:32,020 --> 01:26:35,355
He's two for two with a double and
a monster home run in the third.

1359
01:26:35,398 --> 01:26:36,648
Time!

1360
01:26:39,235 --> 01:26:40,485
Walk him?

1361
01:26:40,570 --> 01:26:41,945
Not a chance.

1362
01:26:42,030 --> 01:26:45,699
Did you see his
last two bats?

1363
01:26:45,783 --> 01:26:47,367
Yeah, I saw them,

1364
01:26:47,452 --> 01:26:50,120
and he can sure hit.

1365
01:26:50,205 --> 01:26:53,373
But he's thinking something
that everybody else is thinking,

1366
01:26:53,416 --> 01:26:56,501
the intentional walk.

1367
01:26:56,586 --> 01:26:59,713
Poor batter.

1368
01:26:59,756 --> 01:27:01,757
With first base open,

1369
01:27:01,841 --> 01:27:05,886
Cesar Faz will definitely
have Enrique walk Carterola.

1370
01:27:08,932 --> 01:27:11,934
He's not going to pitch to him with an open base?

1371
01:27:12,018 --> 01:27:13,518
He's insane.

1372
01:27:15,605 --> 01:27:17,940
Enrique Suarez digs in.

1373
01:27:18,024 --> 01:27:23,779
A hit or an out will send one
of these teams to the finals.

1374
01:27:23,863 --> 01:27:26,323
Enrique, pauses on the mound.

1375
01:27:26,407 --> 01:27:28,742
He gets the sign
from Norberto.

1376
01:27:28,826 --> 01:27:31,245
Here's the wind up.

1377
01:27:33,164 --> 01:27:35,249
Strike one!

1378
01:27:35,291 --> 01:27:38,335
That's a bonehead
move right there.

1379
01:27:38,419 --> 01:27:42,839
It's as if Enrique is saying,
if you're going to beat me, beat my best pitch.

1380
01:27:52,517 --> 01:27:54,101
You know if I
was their coach,

1381
01:27:54,185 --> 01:27:56,270
I never would have
pitched Enrique today,

1382
01:27:56,354 --> 01:27:59,982
and I certainly would've walked Bridgeport's biggest

1383
01:28:00,066 --> 01:28:03,026
slugger with an open base that's textbook stuff.

1384
01:28:03,111 --> 01:28:06,488
Lucky for Monterrey,
I wasn't their coach. You were.

1385
01:28:06,572 --> 01:28:09,533
What are the odds of Carterola lining one up the middle?

1386
01:28:11,703 --> 01:28:15,122
That decision took guts,
but hey, it paid off.

1387
01:28:15,206 --> 01:28:18,625
Yes, it did.
Yes, it did.

1388
01:28:18,710 --> 01:28:20,961
You really
impressed the brass.

1389
01:28:21,045 --> 01:28:23,463
Let's talk next week.

1390
01:28:26,926 --> 01:28:29,344
Who was that man?

1391
01:28:29,429 --> 01:28:31,722
He's with the Saint Louis Cardinals

1392
01:28:31,806 --> 01:28:33,307
So you're
leaving us?

1393
01:28:33,391 --> 01:28:35,976
Of course not.

1394
01:28:36,019 --> 01:28:38,312
Not right now.

1395
01:28:38,354 --> 01:28:42,524
Why? After all
they've done to you?

1396
01:28:42,608 --> 01:28:45,652
It's what I've always wanted Angel.

1397
01:28:45,695 --> 01:28:47,195
A job?

1398
01:28:47,280 --> 01:28:50,198
No. Respect.

1399
01:28:50,283 --> 01:28:55,162
We gave you that before we were winning!

1400
01:29:02,211 --> 01:29:03,503
Let's go!

1401
01:29:25,443 --> 01:29:27,444
Whoa Whoa Whoa?

1402
01:29:31,115 --> 01:29:32,699
A telegram?

1403
01:30:39,934 --> 01:30:41,435
Amen.

1404
01:30:41,519 --> 01:30:45,021
I always been
meaning to ask,

1405
01:30:45,106 --> 01:30:47,482
why the 108th Psalm?

1406
01:30:47,567 --> 01:30:49,860
108 stitches.

1407
01:30:52,488 --> 01:30:54,990
I think they want a pre-game pep talk.

1408
01:30:55,074 --> 01:30:57,659
I...

1409
01:30:57,743 --> 01:31:01,955
Padre Esteban sent you boys a message
of encouragement. I got his words,

1410
01:31:02,039 --> 01:31:04,666
right here.
He wrote this in Louisville

1411
01:31:04,750 --> 01:31:09,045
and asked me to read it to you
all if you reached the finals,

1412
01:31:09,130 --> 01:31:12,674
so, here it goes.
Father Esteban here boys,

1413
01:31:12,758 --> 01:31:15,844
when you take to the field today,
think of Juan Diego,

1414
01:31:15,928 --> 01:31:18,513
and remember after the Bishop threatened him,

1415
01:31:18,598 --> 01:31:23,977
he ran away, lost his woman,
and hid in a bottle.

1416
01:31:24,061 --> 01:31:26,563
It was the bottom
of the ninth with two outs,

1417
01:31:26,647 --> 01:31:29,566
and even though Juan Diego tried to blame the ump,

1418
01:31:29,650 --> 01:31:32,527
and stall the big game,
he crossed that hill,

1419
01:31:32,612 --> 01:31:35,822
and scored the winning run.
Became a hero.

1420
01:31:35,907 --> 01:31:39,659
And like him, if you
keep your faith in God,

1421
01:31:39,702 --> 01:31:44,831
He will help you show La Mesa
what you all are made of.

1422
01:31:44,874 --> 01:31:47,667
How did Father know we were going to play La Mesa?

1423
01:31:52,048 --> 01:31:55,050
He's a man of God, stupid,
he knows!

1424
01:31:55,134 --> 01:31:57,844
He's a man of God.

1425
01:31:57,929 --> 01:31:59,930
Alright! Let's go get them!

1426
01:32:07,146 --> 01:32:10,065
That Father of yours sure has a way with words.

1427
01:32:10,149 --> 01:32:13,318
The team from Monterrey,
south of the border

1428
01:32:13,402 --> 01:32:15,779
is the youngest,
lightest, and smallest team

1429
01:32:15,863 --> 01:32:18,406
to ever play in the annual
Williamsport classic.

1430
01:32:18,491 --> 01:32:21,243
Like David and Goliath,
the two captains shake hands

1431
01:32:21,327 --> 01:32:24,871
at home plate as their teammates
take their final warm ups.

1432
01:32:40,221 --> 01:32:43,265
Papa. That's him,
that's Cesar Faz.

1433
01:32:43,349 --> 01:32:48,061
He looks so small.
He looked taller in church.

1434
01:32:51,065 --> 01:32:53,733
Everyone's at the field,
to hear the game,

1435
01:32:53,776 --> 01:32:55,819
please! One day!

1436
01:32:55,903 --> 01:32:59,864
You're this close to being fired,
now get back to work!

1437
01:32:59,949 --> 01:33:02,909
How you feeling?

1438
01:33:02,994 --> 01:33:05,787
I've never pitched in front of so many people in my life.

1439
01:33:05,871 --> 01:33:10,500
What people?
All I see is you and me having a catch.

1440
01:33:12,587 --> 01:33:14,212
Get 'em.

1441
01:33:18,050 --> 01:33:19,634
Mr. Faz.

1442
01:33:19,719 --> 01:33:21,928
I just arrived from Mexico this morning,

1443
01:33:21,971 --> 01:33:25,682
I'm here to broadcast the game in Spanish.
I have something for you.

1444
01:33:25,766 --> 01:33:26,850
Thanks.

1445
01:33:26,934 --> 01:33:27,934
You're welcome.

1446
01:33:30,855 --> 01:33:34,107
That's from Father Esteban.
By the way, you're doing a great job.

1447
01:33:34,191 --> 01:33:35,317
Thanks.

1448
01:33:35,401 --> 01:33:36,526
You're welcome.

1449
01:33:42,825 --> 01:33:46,244
The umpire
signals for the last warm up pitch,

1450
01:33:46,329 --> 01:33:49,372
nearly 16,000 fans
in attendance at Williamsport

1451
01:33:49,457 --> 01:33:52,000
for the World Series
between La Mesa California

1452
01:33:52,084 --> 01:33:54,794
and that surprising team
from Monterrey, Mexico.

1453
01:33:58,299 --> 01:34:01,843
La Mesa has
crushed every challenger in its path,

1454
01:34:01,927 --> 01:34:05,388
and in today's final showdown,
you know they'll be ready to go to war.

1455
01:34:05,473 --> 01:34:08,892
They're eager to end Monterrey's improbable journey.

1456
01:34:22,990 --> 01:34:26,951
Now, please remain standing
for the Mexican National Anthem.

1457
01:35:05,074 --> 01:35:07,742
Play ball!

1458
01:35:07,827 --> 01:35:11,746
Louis Riley, La Mesa's pitcher,
steps into the batter's box,

1459
01:35:11,831 --> 01:35:15,625
at five nine and half,
he'll be the tallest pitcher Monterrey has ever seen.

1460
01:35:15,710 --> 01:35:18,461
Angel Macias studies the sign,
winds up and delivers

1461
01:35:18,546 --> 01:35:21,131
the first pitch
of the 1957 Championship.

1462
01:35:21,215 --> 01:35:24,092
Riley takes ball one.

1463
01:35:24,176 --> 01:35:28,596
Angel back to pitch again,
here's Angel's second delivery.

1464
01:35:28,681 --> 01:35:30,640
Riley swings,
he hits one sharply

1465
01:35:30,725 --> 01:35:33,727
towards right field,
it's caught!

1466
01:35:33,769 --> 01:35:36,396
That ball would have surely
gone to the wall for extra bases,

1467
01:35:36,480 --> 01:35:41,192
what a start
to today's game.

1468
01:35:41,277 --> 01:35:43,945
This is not right boss!
It's the final game!

1469
01:35:44,029 --> 01:35:45,447
It's for
the championship!

1470
01:35:46,907 --> 01:35:48,992
Macias! Where
are you going?

1471
01:35:49,076 --> 01:35:51,035
I'm going
to a ball game!

1472
01:35:51,120 --> 01:35:54,456
You get back to your station now!
Or you're fired!

1473
01:35:54,540 --> 01:35:58,168
Our sons, are
playing baseball!

1474
01:35:58,252 --> 01:35:59,335
Yeah.

1475
01:36:05,050 --> 01:36:08,261
Toby fouls that one
back leaving the count at 1-2.

1476
01:36:08,345 --> 01:36:12,599
Angel, back to pitch again,
here is his delivery.

1477
01:36:12,641 --> 01:36:16,311
Toby swings and misses,
that is strike three.

1478
01:36:16,395 --> 01:36:19,564
Curveball completely fooled him
and La Mesa batters go down

1479
01:36:19,648 --> 01:36:21,858
in order here
in the first inning.

1480
01:36:21,942 --> 01:36:24,194
Did you save
me a seat?

1481
01:36:24,278 --> 01:36:26,112
What are you
doing here?

1482
01:36:26,197 --> 01:36:28,948
I wouldn't miss
this for the world.

1483
01:36:28,991 --> 01:36:30,700
You're going
to lose your job.

1484
01:36:30,785 --> 01:36:32,452
Not today.

1485
01:36:41,170 --> 01:36:42,545
Come on.

1486
01:37:09,198 --> 01:37:10,490
Strike three!

1487
01:37:10,574 --> 01:37:13,243
Quite the pitchers duel here this afternoon.

1488
01:37:13,327 --> 01:37:15,662
As Louis Riley
and Angel Macias,

1489
01:37:15,746 --> 01:37:19,833
neither one of those pitchers
giving the batters much to hit.

1490
01:37:51,574 --> 01:37:54,367
A scoreless game so far,
but amazing,

1491
01:37:54,410 --> 01:37:58,246
Angel Macias and his band
of pint sized giant killers

1492
01:37:58,330 --> 01:38:01,749
haven't allowed a single La
Mesa batter to reach first base.

1493
01:38:01,834 --> 01:38:05,503
By hook or crook,
by hit, walk or error.

1494
01:38:16,849 --> 01:38:20,476
Bottom of the fifth
here at original Little League field.

1495
01:38:20,561 --> 01:38:22,979
The game is still deadlocked as Ricardo Trevino

1496
01:38:23,063 --> 01:38:25,398
will lead things off
for Monterrey.

1497
01:38:25,441 --> 01:38:28,109
Go get 'em.

1498
01:38:28,193 --> 01:38:30,945
Ricardo steps into the batter's box,

1499
01:38:31,030 --> 01:38:33,072
Riley readies to pitch,

1500
01:38:33,157 --> 01:38:35,742
as Ricardo squares to bunt,
he's hit by the pitch!

1501
01:38:35,826 --> 01:38:39,621
Ricardo falls to the ground after
taking a fastball right in the back.

1502
01:38:39,705 --> 01:38:41,414
Ricardo!

1503
01:38:41,498 --> 01:38:43,082
He's up, he seems to be okay.

1504
01:38:44,960 --> 01:38:47,170
Rico, walks slowly to first,

1505
01:38:47,254 --> 01:38:50,173
so far,
Monterrey is the only team to get runners on base.

1506
01:38:50,257 --> 01:38:52,717
But they haven't been able to
capitalize on those chances yet.

1507
01:38:52,801 --> 01:38:55,011
That will bring up
Baltazar Charles.

1508
01:38:55,095 --> 01:38:58,765
You need to bunt the ball perfectly
so Ricardo can get to second base.

1509
01:38:58,849 --> 01:39:04,228
Baltazar is one of
Monterrey's best power hitters.

1510
01:39:04,313 --> 01:39:07,523
Riley pitches and Baltazar
lays down a perfect bunt.

1511
01:39:07,608 --> 01:39:10,068
Riley fires to second
but not in time

1512
01:39:10,152 --> 01:39:14,530
to catch
a hard sliding Ricardo.

1513
01:39:14,615 --> 01:39:17,116
Okay here's the plan,
hit the ball, hit it hard.

1514
01:39:17,201 --> 01:39:19,786
One of you is
going to win this.

1515
01:39:19,870 --> 01:39:25,458
Angel Macias steps in
with a runner in scoring position.

1516
01:39:25,542 --> 01:39:29,379
Angel hits a deep fly ball.
Back, back, back, oh!

1517
01:39:29,463 --> 01:39:31,881
Oh, he makes
a fantastic catch,

1518
01:39:31,966 --> 01:39:35,802
over his shoulder,
and the runners will have to hold.

1519
01:39:35,886 --> 01:39:38,471
Pepe Maiz is next
for Monterrey.

1520
01:39:38,555 --> 01:39:41,641
Takes a called strike one.

1521
01:39:41,725 --> 01:39:44,769
Riley delivers high
for a ball.

1522
01:39:44,853 --> 01:39:47,814
Pepe swings he sends one
sharply into left center

1523
01:39:47,898 --> 01:39:50,817
for a base hit,
Ricardo is rounding third.

1524
01:39:50,901 --> 01:39:52,902
Go! Go! Go!

1525
01:39:52,987 --> 01:39:54,195
The throw comes in from left,

1526
01:39:54,279 --> 01:39:55,154
it's a perfect throw.

1527
01:39:55,239 --> 01:39:56,864
You're out!

1528
01:39:56,949 --> 01:39:58,199
He's nailed at the plate.

1529
01:39:58,283 --> 01:40:00,243
What a throw!

1530
01:40:00,327 --> 01:40:03,079
That play could have just
saved the game for La Mesa!

1531
01:40:03,163 --> 01:40:06,416
What a missed
opportunity for Monterrey.

1532
01:40:10,212 --> 01:40:14,424
Mario chops one to third,
keeps Baltazar from scoring

1533
01:40:14,508 --> 01:40:17,093
Monterrey has loaded
the bases.

1534
01:40:17,177 --> 01:40:21,264
Lou Riley is still one batter from
pitching himself out of this jam.

1535
01:40:23,017 --> 01:40:25,435
Enrique Suarez is in a slump.

1536
01:40:25,519 --> 01:40:28,604
Hitless in his last
five at bats.

1537
01:40:28,689 --> 01:40:30,189
Strike one!

1538
01:40:33,694 --> 01:40:34,986
Strike two!

1539
01:40:35,070 --> 01:40:37,613
A mighty cut but just
misses it for strike two.

1540
01:40:41,326 --> 01:40:43,786
La Mesa's outfield
isn't taking any chances.

1541
01:40:45,748 --> 01:40:49,459
Riley will be coming
in with the heat.

1542
01:40:49,543 --> 01:40:52,378
When you can see
the wings of the hummingbird,

1543
01:40:52,421 --> 01:40:54,589
you can hit any pitch.

1544
01:41:05,267 --> 01:41:09,270
Enrique Suarez has
just taken a Lou Riley fastball

1545
01:41:09,354 --> 01:41:13,941
into downtown Williamsport.
A monster grand slam.

1546
01:41:14,026 --> 01:41:15,651
Go! Go! Go!

1547
01:41:21,575 --> 01:41:25,453
One by one,
his teammates cross home plate.

1548
01:41:29,583 --> 01:41:31,834
Go! Go! Go!

1549
01:41:31,919 --> 01:41:34,796
We are truly witnessing baseball's version

1550
01:41:34,880 --> 01:41:37,048
of David and Goliath
here this afternoon.

1551
01:41:37,132 --> 01:41:39,884
That's my son!

1552
01:41:39,968 --> 01:41:44,138
Monterrey Industrial has
beaten incredible odds just to get here,

1553
01:41:44,223 --> 01:41:46,390
so many times
they've faced elimination,

1554
01:41:46,475 --> 01:41:49,811
now with one swing,
Enrique Suarez has brought them

1555
01:41:49,895 --> 01:41:53,606
to the brink of the greatest
upset in Little League history.

1556
01:41:53,690 --> 01:41:56,609
Fidel pops out
to finally retire the side.

1557
01:41:56,652 --> 01:42:01,114
The fate of the game now rests on
the pitching arm of Angel Macias.

1558
01:42:01,198 --> 01:42:04,784
Come on boys, last inning,
let's make it happen. Keep focused.

1559
01:42:04,868 --> 01:42:07,912
An amazing turn
of events in the fifth inning,

1560
01:42:07,996 --> 01:42:11,165
it's Monterrey who takes
the field ahead, 4-0.

1561
01:42:11,250 --> 01:42:13,793
Angel! You're
pitching a perfect...

1562
01:42:13,877 --> 01:42:15,878
Shh.

1563
01:42:15,963 --> 01:42:18,965
The other team hasn't gotten anyone to first base,

1564
01:42:19,007 --> 01:42:20,633
that's a perfect...

1565
01:42:20,717 --> 01:42:22,718
Shh.

1566
01:42:22,803 --> 01:42:28,724
Listen, nobody says a single
word to him about this, nobody.

1567
01:42:28,809 --> 01:42:31,060
Everybody got that?

1568
01:42:31,145 --> 01:42:33,479
Alright, come on,
let's make it happen.

1569
01:42:33,564 --> 01:42:36,899
Monterrey's defense
can win this if they can hold on,

1570
01:42:36,984 --> 01:42:41,612
but an even more amazing story
is unfolding here at Williamsport.

1571
01:42:41,697 --> 01:42:46,534
Sixty feet to first base,
that's all that separates Angel Macias from history.

1572
01:42:46,618 --> 01:42:49,745
You realize Angel
is pitching a perf...

1573
01:42:49,830 --> 01:42:53,332
If any La Mesa player
can make it to first base safely,

1574
01:42:53,417 --> 01:42:57,003
they'll ruin it for Angel Macias's
bid for baseball immortality.

1575
01:42:57,087 --> 01:42:59,380
Who will be the spoiler?

1576
01:42:59,464 --> 01:43:03,342
The first hitter swings
at Angel's first pitch,

1577
01:43:03,385 --> 01:43:07,680
it's a towering pop up.
Enrique Suarez makes the catch

1578
01:43:07,723 --> 01:43:11,267
and fires the ball
back into the infield.

1579
01:43:23,697 --> 01:43:27,241
Fred Shweir will be
pinch hitting for Bobby Brown,

1580
01:43:27,326 --> 01:43:30,203
Okay.

1581
01:43:30,245 --> 01:43:33,372
Shweir, hits a weak infield grounder.
No one is covering first base!

1582
01:43:33,457 --> 01:43:35,374
There goes the perfect game!

1583
01:43:35,459 --> 01:43:38,920
Wait! Norberto came out
of nowhere to make the tag!

1584
01:43:39,004 --> 01:43:40,880
Alright! Yeah!
Norberto! Alright!

1585
01:43:40,964 --> 01:43:42,506
Runner is out!

1586
01:43:42,591 --> 01:43:44,759
I have never seen
a Little League catcher

1587
01:43:44,843 --> 01:43:48,095
trail a runner down to first!
Now that is great coaching right there!

1588
01:43:48,180 --> 01:43:50,139
That is
great coaching!

1589
01:43:50,224 --> 01:43:52,600
Unbelievable Berto!
You saved the day!

1590
01:43:52,684 --> 01:43:54,936
I just didn't want to run any more laps,
Mr. Faz.

1591
01:43:56,939 --> 01:43:59,899
One more round.

1592
01:44:10,953 --> 01:44:12,870
I don't remember
saying you could go.

1593
01:44:12,955 --> 01:44:14,080
Papa, I'm going.

1594
01:44:20,087 --> 01:44:21,295
Ball one.

1595
01:44:27,010 --> 01:44:28,594
Ball two.

1596
01:44:35,102 --> 01:44:36,143
Ball three.

1597
01:44:36,228 --> 01:44:38,479
Time!

1598
01:44:38,563 --> 01:44:41,607
What pressure
this young boy must be feeling.

1599
01:44:41,692 --> 01:44:43,901
The weight of a World
Series Championship,

1600
01:44:43,986 --> 01:44:46,737
and the chance
for perfection.

1601
01:44:46,822 --> 01:44:48,739
Are you gonna
take me out?

1602
01:44:48,824 --> 01:44:51,993
We didn't come this far to quit on each other,
did we?

1603
01:44:52,077 --> 01:44:56,872
What does it matter?
You're leaving us anyway?

1604
01:44:56,957 --> 01:45:01,335
Everybody's
counting on you.

1605
01:45:06,008 --> 01:45:10,219
No, no,
Not everyone.

1606
01:45:10,304 --> 01:45:11,971
Oh yeah,
name one person.

1607
01:45:16,810 --> 01:45:20,021
My papa,
he's ashamed of me.

1608
01:45:20,105 --> 01:45:23,065
No.

1609
01:45:23,150 --> 01:45:25,693
Hey,

1610
01:45:25,777 --> 01:45:28,904
I forgot to give
this to you.

1611
01:45:32,993 --> 01:45:34,243
Where did you get this?

1612
01:45:34,328 --> 01:45:37,538
Your father sent it,

1613
01:45:41,293 --> 01:45:43,836
and he's very
proud of you.

1614
01:45:46,923 --> 01:45:49,342
Let's play ball!

1615
01:45:49,384 --> 01:45:52,595
Coach,
I don't mean to interrupt your little chat,

1616
01:45:52,679 --> 01:45:54,847
but there's 16,000
and one of us,

1617
01:45:54,931 --> 01:45:57,391
who think there is a baseball game going on here.

1618
01:45:57,476 --> 01:45:59,101
Play ball!

1619
01:46:01,104 --> 01:46:04,190
You can do
this, Koufax.

1620
01:46:04,274 --> 01:46:07,985
I'm not Sandy Koufax,

1621
01:46:11,031 --> 01:46:13,449
I'm Angel Macias.

1622
01:46:13,533 --> 01:46:16,077
It's 3-0,
and there's no room for error.

1623
01:46:16,161 --> 01:46:18,037
Macias winds up,

1624
01:46:18,121 --> 01:46:21,374
he splits the plate
for strike one.

1625
01:46:21,458 --> 01:46:25,920
Angel's teammates get set,
they know what's at stake.

1626
01:46:30,717 --> 01:46:32,051
Strike two!

1627
01:46:46,650 --> 01:46:49,402
Angel! Angel!

1628
01:46:57,077 --> 01:46:58,452
Come on!

1629
01:47:06,002 --> 01:47:08,712
Angel! Angel!

1630
01:47:22,519 --> 01:47:23,686
Strike three!

1631
01:47:49,629 --> 01:47:51,714
That's it! We won!

1632
01:47:59,890 --> 01:48:01,390
We did it! We did it!

1633
01:48:03,977 --> 01:48:05,311
Who took my cigars?!

1634
01:48:08,315 --> 01:48:09,857
You still looking for that angle?

1635
01:48:09,941 --> 01:48:11,734
Always.

1636
01:48:11,818 --> 01:48:14,820
Well here it is,
you don't win the game out there,

1637
01:48:14,863 --> 01:48:16,363
you win it right
in here.

1638
01:48:16,448 --> 01:48:18,407
That's not the only
game played there.

1639
01:48:21,495 --> 01:48:22,703
You take care, Cesar.

1640
01:48:22,787 --> 01:48:23,996
Excuse me.

1641
01:48:24,080 --> 01:48:25,664
Mr. Faz.

1642
01:48:25,749 --> 01:48:27,333
I believe I got
something to say to you.

1643
01:48:27,417 --> 01:48:28,209
I feel the same way.

1644
01:48:28,293 --> 01:48:29,877
You do?

1645
01:48:29,961 --> 01:48:31,712
At first, I was angry,
but then, my father

1646
01:48:31,796 --> 01:48:33,088
got your telegram,
and he said,

1647
01:48:33,173 --> 01:48:34,507
we were going
to Williamsport

1648
01:48:34,591 --> 01:48:36,091
Telegram.

1649
01:48:36,176 --> 01:48:38,010
Yeah.

1650
01:48:38,094 --> 01:48:40,513
The unexpected play.
At the unexpected time!

1651
01:48:40,555 --> 01:48:42,139
Telegram, yeah! Okay.

1652
01:48:42,224 --> 01:48:44,767
Finally, Mr. Faz,
I'm honored to meet you.

1653
01:48:44,851 --> 01:48:47,061
It's an honor
to meet you.

1654
01:48:50,941 --> 01:48:53,192
Monterrey's Angel Macias

1655
01:48:53,276 --> 01:48:56,654
pitched his team to victory
setting down 18 batters in a row.

1656
01:48:56,738 --> 01:48:59,490
A perfect game.
The little tykes from Mexico

1657
01:48:59,574 --> 01:49:04,119
are the first foreign team ever to
win Little League's highest honor.

1658
01:49:04,204 --> 01:49:07,248
Four weeks ago these kids
walked across the desert,

1659
01:49:07,332 --> 01:49:10,918
but now that they're champions,
they're not going to have to walk home.

1660
01:49:11,002 --> 01:49:14,171
First stop, Ebbets Field,
as the guests of the Brooklyn Dodgers,

1661
01:49:14,256 --> 01:49:18,092
where they rubbed shoulders with the
real Roy Campanella, and Duke Snider.

1662
01:49:18,176 --> 01:49:22,054
Even Stan the Man Musial takes a
pitching type from Angel Macias.

1663
01:49:27,727 --> 01:49:30,020
If meeting the Brooklyn
Dodgers wasn't enough,

1664
01:49:30,105 --> 01:49:31,939
the boys
were invited to the home

1665
01:49:32,023 --> 01:49:34,400
of the biggest baseball fan
in the free world,

1666
01:49:34,484 --> 01:49:36,902
Mr. President Eisenhower.

1667
01:49:36,945 --> 01:49:40,114
Even lke wanted to pose for a
photo in front of that huge trophy.

1668
01:49:40,198 --> 01:49:44,368
Just wait 'till they tell their
friends back home about this.

1669
01:49:46,538 --> 01:49:48,330
What was the best
part for you guys?

1670
01:49:48,415 --> 01:49:50,749
All those beautiful
girls in New York City.

1671
01:49:50,792 --> 01:49:53,460
Going to the White House and
meeting President Eisenhower.

1672
01:49:53,545 --> 01:49:56,505
I took one of his pens.

1673
01:49:56,590 --> 01:50:00,092
I think Mr.
Faz has finally got his siesta.

1674
01:50:32,000 --> 01:50:36,712
Papa, I'm sorry for
missing my chores for so long.

1675
01:50:39,507 --> 01:50:42,635
Chores can wait
for a champion.

1676
01:50:46,514 --> 01:50:49,224
For Pedro's shrine.

1677
01:50:50,644 --> 01:50:52,353
No, my son.

1678
01:50:52,437 --> 01:50:54,980
It's for you.

1679
01:51:02,572 --> 01:51:07,076
Come, Monterrey wants
to see its heroes.

01:56:12,423 --> 01:56:16,051
♫ Rocking across Texas
Rocking to the promised land ♫

1735
01:56:16,135 --> 01:56:20,138
♫ I got an old yellow bus
Four tires, no spare ♫

1736
01:56:20,223 --> 01:56:22,849
♫ I ain't sure how
But I'm gonna get there ♫

1737
01:56:22,934 --> 01:56:27,980
♫ I'm rocking,
Rocking across The Rio Grande ♫

1738
01:56:28,022 --> 01:56:33,402
♫ Rocking across Texas
Rocking to the promised land ♫

1739
01:56:33,486 --> 01:56:36,029
♫ We'll roll on driving
From town to town ♫

1740
01:56:36,114 --> 01:56:38,824
♫ May get close
So don't slow down ♫

1741
01:56:38,866 --> 01:56:41,576
♫ Lordy, Lordy
It's in our hands ♫

1742
01:56:41,661 --> 01:56:45,497
♫ We won't stop
'Till the promised land ♫

1743
01:56:45,540 --> 01:56:47,833
♫ I'm rocking ♫

1744
01:56:55,508 --> 01:56:57,843
♫♫ Yeah! Get down! ♫♫
