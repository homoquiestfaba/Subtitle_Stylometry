1
00:00:11,887 --> 00:00:13,657
City of new orleans 911.

2
00:00:13,681 --> 00:00:15,200
911. What's
the address of you emergency?

3
00:00:15,224 --> 00:00:18,142
Austin 911. Do
you need police, fire, or ems?

4
00:00:18,185 --> 00:00:20,310
I've always wondered

5
00:00:20,354 --> 00:00:22,604
what actually happens
when we call 911?

6
00:00:22,648 --> 00:00:24,501
Who are the mysterious voices
on the other end of that line?

7
00:00:24,525 --> 00:00:26,775
Tell me exactly what happened.

8
00:00:26,819 --> 00:00:28,588
Stay on the line.
I'm gonna tell you what to do next.

9
00:00:28,612 --> 00:00:30,132
You're doing a great job, okay?

10
00:00:30,156 --> 00:00:32,656
Who are the faceless
strangers that we reach out to

11
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:35,117
in our darkest moments?

12
00:00:35,161 --> 00:00:36,744
They navigate the unknown,

13
00:00:36,787 --> 00:00:40,581
keep calm in the chaos.

14
00:00:40,624 --> 00:00:42,352
I don't know!
Just send the cops!

15
00:00:42,376 --> 00:00:43,937
- I just heard some gunshots.
- They're trying to hit me.

16
00:00:43,961 --> 00:00:44,626
Oh, my god. Please hurry.

17
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:47,296
Please help!

18
00:00:47,339 --> 00:00:49,067
They're driven by
a desire to help.

19
00:00:49,091 --> 00:00:50,444
Ma'am, listen to me.

20
00:00:50,468 --> 00:00:52,612
Stay where you are.
I have officers going after him.

21
00:00:52,636 --> 00:00:54,553
You can do this.
We're gonna do this together.

22
00:00:54,597 --> 00:00:55,949
You don't need to be scared.
We have them coming to you.

23
00:00:55,973 --> 00:00:57,242
Take a deep
breath. Take a deep breath.

24
00:00:57,266 --> 00:00:58,326
We have help
heading that direction.

25
00:00:58,350 --> 00:00:59,558
Thank you.

26
00:00:59,602 --> 00:01:00,602
This is what I found.

27
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:08,025
240 million...

28
00:01:08,069 --> 00:01:12,112
That's how many calls americans
make every year to 911.

29
00:01:12,156 --> 00:01:13,614
Nearly a quarter billion calls

30
00:01:13,657 --> 00:01:16,533
ranging from the absurd
to the tragic

31
00:01:16,577 --> 00:01:18,869
to random butt dials.

32
00:01:18,913 --> 00:01:20,829
Let's not beat around the bush.

33
00:01:20,873 --> 00:01:23,624
This has been a crazy year.

34
00:01:23,667 --> 00:01:27,377
But day in, day out,
pandemic or no pandemic,

35
00:01:27,421 --> 00:01:29,649
911 operators, they answer
the phone knowing anything...

36
00:01:29,673 --> 00:01:33,133
Literally anything...
Could be about to unfold.

37
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:41,391
Austin 911. Do you need
police, fire, or ems?

38
00:01:41,435 --> 00:01:43,519
Police department.

39
00:01:43,562 --> 00:01:45,729
My neighbor's
smoking crack, man.

40
00:01:45,773 --> 00:01:47,731
- I'm in the restroom now.
- I just smell the

41
00:01:47,775 --> 00:01:51,985
makes me want to come out there
and take a

42
00:01:52,029 --> 00:01:54,404
I think certain people
are meant to be 911 operators.

43
00:01:54,448 --> 00:01:57,366
Certain people are not meant
to be a 911 operators.

44
00:01:57,409 --> 00:01:58,678
You're doing a great job.

45
00:01:58,702 --> 00:02:00,680
Officers are just down
the street now.

46
00:02:00,704 --> 00:02:01,890
Okay, and what kind of vehicles
are involved?

47
00:02:01,914 --> 00:02:02,788
I'm gonna stay on the phone
with you

48
00:02:02,832 --> 00:02:03,975
until the officers get there.

49
00:02:03,999 --> 00:02:05,833
In a single shift,

50
00:02:05,876 --> 00:02:06,895
I could take
up to 100 calls per night.

51
00:02:06,919 --> 00:02:08,438
There's a guy walking around

52
00:02:08,462 --> 00:02:10,982
with a samurai sword
on his back.
Say that one more time.

53
00:02:11,006 --> 00:02:14,383
This is the drunkest
driver I've ever seen.
Okay.

54
00:02:14,426 --> 00:02:15,050
Someone trying to get
into my house

55
00:02:15,094 --> 00:02:17,970
through the back door.

56
00:02:18,013 --> 00:02:21,306
Yeah, I have a cat
stuck up in a tree.

57
00:02:21,350 --> 00:02:24,852
You take so many different
types of calls, it's insane.

58
00:02:24,895 --> 00:02:26,331
My wife is gonna kill me.

59
00:02:26,355 --> 00:02:27,374
I locked my baby in the car.

60
00:02:27,398 --> 00:02:30,607
Whenever I have calls with kids,

61
00:02:30,651 --> 00:02:32,818
that pulls on my heartstrings.

62
00:02:32,862 --> 00:02:34,464
You know, you're human,
so you've got those feelings.

63
00:02:34,488 --> 00:02:35,549
Some of us have weaknesses,

64
00:02:35,573 --> 00:02:38,699
and kids are
definitely my weakness.

65
00:02:38,742 --> 00:02:41,869
This is austin 911. Do you need
police, fire, or ems?

66
00:02:41,912 --> 00:02:45,831
I need 911! Someone took
my car with my baby in there!

67
00:02:45,875 --> 00:02:47,853
Ma'am, what kind of help
do you need? Are you okay?

68
00:02:47,877 --> 00:02:49,117
Do you need an ambulance?

69
00:02:53,465 --> 00:02:55,132
Can...

70
00:03:05,603 --> 00:03:08,003
Okay. How many children
do you have in there?

71
00:03:09,732 --> 00:03:12,127
Okay. Which way did they go
so we can go after them?

72
00:03:12,151 --> 00:03:13,984
I don't know what street.

73
00:03:14,028 --> 00:03:15,505
That's okay.
We still have help for you.

74
00:03:15,529 --> 00:03:16,486
It doesn't matter
which way they went.

75
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:18,650
Okay, we're sending help to you.

76
00:03:20,659 --> 00:03:23,577
Auto theft. The child
was asleep in the back seat.

77
00:03:23,621 --> 00:03:25,061
What kind of vehicle
did he leave in?

78
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
And what kind of vehicle?

79
00:03:30,044 --> 00:03:32,211
A range rover.

80
00:03:32,254 --> 00:03:35,380
I think it's a 2015 range rover.

81
00:03:35,424 --> 00:03:36,984
What color? It's white.

82
00:03:37,009 --> 00:03:38,695
We have help on the way to you,
okay?

83
00:03:38,719 --> 00:03:40,219
You're doing a great job.

84
00:03:40,262 --> 00:03:41,929
Please get my baby back.

85
00:03:49,313 --> 00:03:52,648
Take a deep breath.

86
00:03:52,691 --> 00:03:54,972
Everyone is coming for you.

87
00:04:17,466 --> 00:04:19,675
Everyone, I have a location.

88
00:04:19,718 --> 00:04:21,918
I need missing persons
detective to 21.

89
00:04:37,695 --> 00:04:40,487
Clear a path.
Fell asleep in the vehicle.

90
00:04:40,531 --> 00:04:42,114
Confirm all units.

91
00:04:42,157 --> 00:04:43,157
Resume normal traffic.

92
00:04:52,251 --> 00:04:54,793
How does deb prepare
herself for a call like that?

93
00:04:54,837 --> 00:04:59,965
And even more so, how does she
move on from a call like that?

94
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,528
There's no time
to process emotions,

95
00:05:01,552 --> 00:05:05,137
no matter how much a call may
trigger something inside of you.

96
00:05:08,225 --> 00:05:10,475
Here we go.

97
00:05:10,519 --> 00:05:12,811
Alright.
Let me show you how this works.

98
00:05:12,855 --> 00:05:14,688
So you call 911.

99
00:05:17,401 --> 00:05:18,734
Now, your phone's location,

100
00:05:18,777 --> 00:05:22,612
it determines the call center
that you're routed to.

101
00:05:22,656 --> 00:05:25,782
Austin 911. Do you need,
police, fire, or ems?

102
00:05:25,826 --> 00:05:27,826
As you explain the emergency,

103
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:31,663
everything you tell the call
taker is logged in a report.

104
00:05:31,707 --> 00:05:34,374
Now, based on the situation,

105
00:05:34,418 --> 00:05:36,458
the appropriate response
is dispatched.

106
00:05:41,175 --> 00:05:43,215
Whether that's
the police department...

107
00:05:45,679 --> 00:05:46,839
...The fire department...

108
00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:50,350
...Or an ambulance.

109
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:56,229
Maybe all three.

110
00:05:56,273 --> 00:05:57,876
The responding units,
they have access

111
00:05:57,900 --> 00:06:02,694
to that very same information
gathered by the call taker.

112
00:06:02,738 --> 00:06:04,466
So when they show up
on your doorstep,

113
00:06:04,490 --> 00:06:06,865
they know exactly
what they're walking into.

114
00:06:20,631 --> 00:06:24,299
911. What's the address
of the emergency?

115
00:06:24,343 --> 00:06:25,343
Old ridge camp.

116
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:30,347
Okay, what's going on?

117
00:06:30,391 --> 00:06:35,727
Um, there's a grizzly bear
that's been stalking us.

118
00:06:35,771 --> 00:06:37,165
There's a grizzly bear? Yeah.

119
00:06:37,189 --> 00:06:40,607
Did the bear actually attack you
or come towards you?

120
00:06:40,651 --> 00:06:42,025
It charged twice.

121
00:06:48,367 --> 00:06:50,325
And then it came back, charged.

122
00:06:50,369 --> 00:06:52,160
Sprayed it again.

123
00:06:52,204 --> 00:06:54,349
The bear's coming back to you?

124
00:06:54,373 --> 00:06:55,497
We don't know yet.

125
00:06:55,541 --> 00:06:57,666
How old are you?

126
00:06:57,709 --> 00:06:59,209
19 years old.

127
00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:04,005
How big was it?

128
00:07:04,049 --> 00:07:05,215
12 feet tall.

129
00:07:05,259 --> 00:07:07,676
12 feet?

130
00:07:07,719 --> 00:07:09,319
He's the biggest thing
I've ever seen.

131
00:07:22,317 --> 00:07:24,943
For a brown bear,
you want to play dead,

132
00:07:24,987 --> 00:07:26,965
and a black bear,
you want to fight back.

133
00:07:29,658 --> 00:07:31,825
Did I lose you?

134
00:07:38,709 --> 00:07:41,069
What was that?
What did I just hear?

135
00:07:45,924 --> 00:07:48,008
I just stepped on the dog.

136
00:07:48,051 --> 00:07:49,112
Oh, okay.
You stepped on your dog.

137
00:07:49,136 --> 00:07:52,637
Okay. Good.

138
00:07:52,681 --> 00:07:53,346
Are you able to get back
to your vehicle?

139
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:55,015
No, ma'am.

140
00:07:55,058 --> 00:07:58,185
The... the bear is
between us and there.

141
00:07:58,228 --> 00:08:01,438
I'm working on getting a ranger
up there to find you, okay?

142
00:08:01,482 --> 00:08:03,231
Oh, thank you so much.

143
00:08:23,712 --> 00:08:25,398
I'm really scared
the bear is gonna come back.

144
00:08:25,422 --> 00:08:26,900
Being scared is
completely natural.

145
00:08:26,924 --> 00:08:29,716
Don't you worry about it.
I'm right here with you, okay?

146
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:31,885
Okay. I don't blame them.

147
00:08:31,929 --> 00:08:34,129
I wouldn't want to be chased
by a bear, either.

148
00:08:36,016 --> 00:08:38,350
Running uphill, no less.

149
00:08:38,393 --> 00:08:40,633
Are you still walking
that trail?

150
00:08:42,773 --> 00:08:44,189
Alright.

151
00:08:44,233 --> 00:08:47,150
We do have a trooper
on his way to you, okay?

152
00:08:47,194 --> 00:08:48,296
They're looking for you guys.

153
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:50,070
Get there as fast as possible.

154
00:08:59,581 --> 00:09:02,374
Have you passed the first
or second bench?

155
00:09:02,417 --> 00:09:04,103
Okay, you're past the second?

156
00:09:04,127 --> 00:09:07,337
You're at the top?

157
00:09:07,381 --> 00:09:09,581
Looks like I have two troopers
headed that way.

158
00:09:16,974 --> 00:09:19,414
I'm gonna stay
on the line with you, okay?

159
00:09:40,163 --> 00:09:42,622
In contact with hikers.
Everyone 10-60.

160
00:09:42,666 --> 00:09:44,227
Whoo-hoo. - They made it.

161
00:09:44,251 --> 00:09:47,085
They made it.
No bear attacks today.

162
00:09:47,129 --> 00:09:48,856
- Today.
- Yeah. Happy endings.

163
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:51,798
They're both okay.
And they learned a life lesson.

164
00:09:51,842 --> 00:09:54,737
Did they, though?
They'll be going and getting
a firearm, I'm hoping.

165
00:09:54,761 --> 00:09:56,447
Life lessons learned, right?

166
00:09:56,471 --> 00:09:57,762
Yeah.

167
00:10:00,392 --> 00:10:03,977
If it's brown, lay down,

168
00:10:04,021 --> 00:10:06,104
and if it's black, fight back.

169
00:10:06,148 --> 00:10:08,898
That's a rhyme I learned
while camping as a kid.

170
00:10:08,942 --> 00:10:11,901
Suddenly, they're the most
important words I've ever heard.

171
00:10:11,945 --> 00:10:14,029
At least it wasn't a polar bear,

172
00:10:14,072 --> 00:10:15,675
because I believe
the rhyme ends with

173
00:10:15,699 --> 00:10:17,949
"if it's white, good night."

174
00:10:22,539 --> 00:10:24,225
City of new orleans 911.

175
00:10:24,249 --> 00:10:25,310
What's the address
of your emergency?

176
00:10:25,334 --> 00:10:26,603
City of new orleans 911.

177
00:10:26,627 --> 00:10:27,937
What's the address
of your emergency?

178
00:10:27,961 --> 00:10:29,022
- City of new orleans.
- City of new orleans 911.

179
00:10:29,046 --> 00:10:30,670
City of new orleans 911.

180
00:10:30,714 --> 00:10:34,007
What is the location
of your emergency?

181
00:10:34,051 --> 00:10:37,886
There's no place
like new orleans.

182
00:10:37,929 --> 00:10:40,889
There's no other people
like new orleans people,

183
00:10:40,932 --> 00:10:47,062
because down here,
we can open our door to anybody.

184
00:10:47,105 --> 00:10:50,607
I have people
that I've worked with,

185
00:10:50,651 --> 00:10:52,901
and we just became family.

186
00:10:52,944 --> 00:10:55,256
I like to be a good wingwoman.

187
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:56,633
How about I tag along with you
for a change?

188
00:10:56,657 --> 00:10:57,884
I just want to... I just want to
be here for support,

189
00:10:57,908 --> 00:10:58,908
whatever you need.

190
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:04,496
I think that's what
makes us who we are.

191
00:11:04,539 --> 00:11:06,339
That's what makes us different.

192
00:11:09,127 --> 00:11:13,713
When you're call taking,
you have to have compassion.

193
00:11:13,757 --> 00:11:16,925
You have to have patience.

194
00:11:16,968 --> 00:11:18,093
It's not always easy.

195
00:11:18,136 --> 00:11:19,427
Oh, hang on.

196
00:11:19,471 --> 00:11:21,616
Wait, hold on, ma'am.
You're cutting in and out.

197
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:23,951
I'm trying to get the
information. Give me one moment.

198
00:11:23,975 --> 00:11:26,226
Because if you have somebody
calling in

199
00:11:26,269 --> 00:11:28,019
and they screaming at you,

200
00:11:28,063 --> 00:11:29,666
you have to be able
to calm them down

201
00:11:29,690 --> 00:11:32,107
so you can get them the help
that they're looking for.

202
00:11:38,490 --> 00:11:40,323
City of new orleans 911.

203
00:11:40,367 --> 00:11:43,243
What is the location
of your emergency?

204
00:11:43,286 --> 00:11:46,871
Um, ma'am, I'm on
carol sue avenue in terrytown.

205
00:11:46,915 --> 00:11:49,666
There's cars all over,

206
00:11:49,710 --> 00:11:50,750
and the water's coming up.

207
00:11:54,172 --> 00:11:56,612
I don't know what's going on,
but I'm about to start floating.

208
00:11:59,553 --> 00:12:00,822
City of new orleans.
Police, fire, ems...

209
00:12:00,846 --> 00:12:04,806
- How may I assist your call?
- Yeah, hi, sorry.

210
00:12:04,850 --> 00:12:06,891
I'm calling about the water
flood in terrytown.

211
00:12:06,935 --> 00:12:08,977
I ain't never seen
the water this high.

212
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:11,165
Girl, look at
all these flood calls.

213
00:12:11,189 --> 00:12:12,897
I know.
That's what I'm looking at.

214
00:12:12,941 --> 00:12:14,733
City of new orleans 911.

215
00:12:14,776 --> 00:12:16,170
What's the address
of your emergency?

216
00:12:16,194 --> 00:12:18,319
I'm on the superdome exit,

217
00:12:18,363 --> 00:12:19,799
and my car is like
stuck in the water.

218
00:12:19,823 --> 00:12:24,075
I think my engine's flooded.
I can't turn my car back on.

219
00:12:24,119 --> 00:12:25,388
Are you able to see
a street sign, sir,

220
00:12:25,412 --> 00:12:28,955
so you can tell me
what street you're closest to?

221
00:12:28,999 --> 00:12:31,624
I'm just right off the I-10
under the bridge.

222
00:12:31,668 --> 00:12:32,542
And you're inside
of the vehicle?

223
00:12:32,586 --> 00:12:33,543
Yes.

224
00:12:33,587 --> 00:12:35,962
Alright.

225
00:12:36,006 --> 00:12:40,175
I mean, it isn't
raining, but it keeps rising.

226
00:12:40,218 --> 00:12:43,094
Look, I've been stuck here
20, 25 minutes.

227
00:12:43,138 --> 00:12:45,324
Okay. Is your vehicle floating,

228
00:12:45,348 --> 00:12:47,201
or are there just vehicles
in the area?

229
00:12:47,225 --> 00:12:48,661
The vehicles in the area
in front of me

230
00:12:48,685 --> 00:12:49,954
and all around me are floating.

231
00:12:49,978 --> 00:12:52,687
But I'm about to start floating.

232
00:12:58,195 --> 00:13:00,695
Are you able to get out
of the vehicle, sir?

233
00:13:00,739 --> 00:13:02,238
No.

234
00:13:02,282 --> 00:13:05,492
So if you open your door,
your car is gonna flood?

235
00:13:05,535 --> 00:13:08,453
Yes.

236
00:13:08,497 --> 00:13:10,433
Alright, hold on for me
just a minute.

237
00:13:10,457 --> 00:13:11,809
It's raining...
It's flooding over there?

238
00:13:11,833 --> 00:13:13,208
Girl, I don't know.

239
00:13:13,251 --> 00:13:15,331
You know, they working on
the canal over there, so...

240
00:13:17,547 --> 00:13:19,881
Oh, my god.

241
00:13:23,845 --> 00:13:26,095
Damn.

242
00:13:26,139 --> 00:13:30,892
In this job,
you have to want to be here,

243
00:13:30,936 --> 00:13:34,354
and what keeps me here
are the citizens.

244
00:13:34,397 --> 00:13:35,792
New orleans has
a basic foundation

245
00:13:35,816 --> 00:13:38,566
of hospitality and love.

246
00:13:38,610 --> 00:13:45,323
Post-katrina, our callers need
someone that wants to help them.

247
00:13:45,367 --> 00:13:47,303
Okay, I just want...
I want you to be safe.

248
00:13:47,327 --> 00:13:49,180
Well, what do you think
we should...

249
00:13:49,204 --> 00:13:50,515
Do you think we should get out
or something?

250
00:13:50,539 --> 00:13:54,290
Are you able to get out
and step off to the side?

251
00:13:54,334 --> 00:13:55,478
I don't know.
I guess I could, like,

252
00:13:55,502 --> 00:13:58,920
jump out the window or
something. I don't know.

253
00:13:58,964 --> 00:14:01,067
I'm gonna get you
some help out there, okay?

254
00:14:01,091 --> 00:14:03,591
This is pissing me off.

255
00:14:03,635 --> 00:14:05,301
Where are the police?

256
00:14:05,345 --> 00:14:06,948
My police unit is stuck
in the water

257
00:14:06,972 --> 00:14:07,762
and unable to respond as well.

258
00:14:07,806 --> 00:14:11,266
Oh, lord. This is crazy.

259
00:14:11,309 --> 00:14:12,870
We're gonna have to
send the cavalry.

260
00:14:12,894 --> 00:14:15,353
I'm getting fire to you, okay?

261
00:14:20,110 --> 00:14:22,986
There's teamwork in all aspects.

262
00:14:23,029 --> 00:14:27,907
You cannot do this job without
thinking of it as a team.

263
00:14:27,951 --> 00:14:30,785
It's a big old family.

264
00:14:30,829 --> 00:14:34,038
The rain stopped,
but the water just keeps...

265
00:14:34,082 --> 00:14:35,874
It just keeps rising.

266
00:14:35,917 --> 00:14:38,209
Where is the water coming from?

267
00:14:38,253 --> 00:14:39,272
I mean, I'm gonna have water
pretty soon.

268
00:14:39,296 --> 00:14:40,545
Okay.

269
00:14:40,589 --> 00:14:43,506
People are going up
and down both sides

270
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:45,800
of the street the wrong way,
trying to get out.

271
00:14:45,844 --> 00:14:47,780
- Alright, sir.
- Oh, my god.

272
00:14:47,804 --> 00:14:48,720
Water's coming in
on my thighs now.

273
00:14:48,763 --> 00:14:51,097
Are you able to get out?

274
00:14:51,141 --> 00:14:52,827
Maybe on the other side.
Yeah, I could, um...

275
00:14:52,851 --> 00:14:54,370
I could jump out the window
or something.

276
00:14:54,394 --> 00:14:56,102
I don't know.

277
00:14:56,146 --> 00:14:58,187
I got to roll my pants up.

278
00:14:58,231 --> 00:14:59,292
Can you see if
anybody is trapped

279
00:14:59,316 --> 00:15:00,607
in their vehicles or not?

280
00:15:00,650 --> 00:15:03,526
Yes, somebody is stuck
in their vehicle.

281
00:15:03,570 --> 00:15:06,863
They're trying to climb out
the... the window now.

282
00:15:06,907 --> 00:15:09,198
Alright, sweetie.

283
00:15:09,242 --> 00:15:11,304
I want to make sure
you guys are okay as well.

284
00:15:11,328 --> 00:15:14,037
A truck is stupidly
driving down the street.

285
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:15,371
Don't come this way.

286
00:15:15,415 --> 00:15:17,415
Come on! Stop!

287
00:15:17,459 --> 00:15:20,271
Slow down. Come on!

288
00:15:20,295 --> 00:15:21,502
Slow down! Slow down!

289
00:15:21,546 --> 00:15:23,880
Slow down! Slow down! Hey!

290
00:15:32,432 --> 00:15:35,433
Don't come this way. Stop!

291
00:15:35,477 --> 00:15:37,685
Slow down! Come on!

292
00:15:37,729 --> 00:15:40,104
Slow down! Slow down!

293
00:15:40,148 --> 00:15:41,648
Slow down! Slow down! Hey!

294
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:47,153
Hello?

295
00:15:50,533 --> 00:15:53,534
Are you there?

296
00:15:53,578 --> 00:15:56,037
Are you okay?

297
00:15:56,081 --> 00:15:59,832
I'm okay.

298
00:15:59,876 --> 00:16:03,544
Swear to god,
people are disgusting.

299
00:16:03,588 --> 00:16:05,129
It's okay. We're go...

300
00:16:05,173 --> 00:16:06,484
But we're gonna get you
some help, though.

301
00:16:06,508 --> 00:16:07,818
That's the most important thing.

302
00:16:07,842 --> 00:16:11,594
I swear, I'mma get my belt
and whoop somebody's tail.

303
00:16:11,638 --> 00:16:14,806
I understand.

304
00:16:14,849 --> 00:16:16,744
New orleans is uniquely
vulnerable to flooding.

305
00:16:16,768 --> 00:16:18,977
The city's like a bowl

306
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:21,521
resting an average
of six feet below sea level,

307
00:16:21,564 --> 00:16:24,565
making every storm
a potential catastrophe.

308
00:16:24,609 --> 00:16:26,943
See the fire truck coming?

309
00:16:26,987 --> 00:16:29,445
No. I guess the fire truck
couldn't come this way.

310
00:16:29,489 --> 00:16:32,448
He turned off.

311
00:16:32,492 --> 00:16:35,201
We're gonna
make sure you're okay,

312
00:16:35,245 --> 00:16:37,620
and we just have to go
check on your vehicle later.

313
00:16:37,664 --> 00:16:40,206
It's unfortunate,
but it ain't worth your life.

314
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:41,811
Yeah, it's dangerous
to get out right here.

315
00:16:41,835 --> 00:16:43,813
It's just water.
Alright, hold on for me
just a minute, sir.

316
00:16:43,837 --> 00:16:45,189
I don't want to let you
off the phone yet.

317
00:16:45,213 --> 00:16:48,006
I just want to make sure
I get you some help, okay?

318
00:16:48,049 --> 00:16:49,193
I just checked with the bridge.

319
00:16:49,217 --> 00:16:50,236
We are standing up
our high-water assets

320
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:52,100
to get them ready
for deployment.

321
00:16:52,137 --> 00:16:54,178
I got some cars stranded.

322
00:16:54,222 --> 00:16:55,741
There's a lady was stranded
on top of her car.

323
00:16:55,765 --> 00:16:58,035
She did manage
to get out of the vehicle.

324
00:16:58,059 --> 00:16:59,267
Okay.

325
00:17:00,687 --> 00:17:03,688
I hear sirens.

326
00:17:03,732 --> 00:17:06,013
Yeah,
that's the fire department.

327
00:17:22,834 --> 00:17:26,502
Lord, the houses
are getting flooded over there.

328
00:17:26,546 --> 00:17:28,337
Oh, that's just great.

329
00:17:28,381 --> 00:17:30,715
Is that the kind of night
we gonna have?

330
00:17:30,759 --> 00:17:33,134
Oh, man, I hope not.
The rain just started.

331
00:17:33,178 --> 00:17:36,888
It's new orleans, unfortunately.

332
00:17:36,931 --> 00:17:39,348
Of course we try and prepare,

333
00:17:39,392 --> 00:17:42,393
but at times,
911 is our only lifeline

334
00:17:42,437 --> 00:17:44,604
to save us from the power
of mother nature.

335
00:17:44,647 --> 00:17:46,606
Sometimes, though,

336
00:17:46,649 --> 00:17:48,858
our interactions with
the natural world

337
00:17:48,902 --> 00:17:50,546
can be a little less
life-threatening.

338
00:17:59,871 --> 00:18:03,206
Austin 911. Do you need
police, fire, or ems?

339
00:18:03,249 --> 00:18:05,583
We have a peacock
in the middle of the street,

340
00:18:05,627 --> 00:18:07,085
and people are dodging it.

341
00:18:07,128 --> 00:18:09,528
I'm sorry. Y-you have a what
in the middle of the street?

342
00:18:11,216 --> 00:18:14,050
A peacock. Okay.

343
00:18:14,094 --> 00:18:16,334
Hold on one second for me.

344
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:21,077
Okay, has anybody
been injured at all?

345
00:18:21,101 --> 00:18:22,221
Okay. Okay.

346
00:18:27,023 --> 00:18:29,263
I'm sorry. One more time?

347
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:33,060
Okay. Okay, gotcha. Gotcha.

348
00:18:36,741 --> 00:18:39,742
Headed down...

349
00:18:39,786 --> 00:18:42,106
Which direction is he going?

350
00:18:42,205 --> 00:18:43,325
Southbound?

351
00:18:48,753 --> 00:18:50,523
Alright. I've got that call
entered for you.

352
00:18:50,547 --> 00:18:53,089
If anything changes
before the officers get there,

353
00:18:53,133 --> 00:18:55,453
just give us
a call back again, okay?

354
00:18:55,677 --> 00:18:56,968
Alright. Thank you.

355
00:19:00,431 --> 00:19:02,515
Peacock's on the run.

356
00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:03,619
That's funny.

357
00:19:13,570 --> 00:19:15,881
911. What's the address
of the emergency?

358
00:19:15,905 --> 00:19:17,865
My name's frank.
My phone is about ready to die.

359
00:19:19,826 --> 00:19:23,035
I'm at the talkeetna river.

360
00:19:23,079 --> 00:19:24,515
I got stuck on my four-wheeler
out here.

361
00:19:24,539 --> 00:19:27,206
I went to go through a little
channel and it was muck,

362
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:29,876
and my damn boot blew about
and I got a fractured leg.

363
00:19:32,338 --> 00:19:33,658
Can't make it out of here.

364
00:19:36,467 --> 00:19:39,427
Did you get into the water
or anything like that?

365
00:19:39,470 --> 00:19:42,096
I'm in knee deep,
almost waist deep.

366
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:43,742
You were submerged down
to the waist or so?

367
00:19:43,766 --> 00:19:46,017
Yes.

368
00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:47,746
Okay.
Do you have any help with you?

369
00:19:47,770 --> 00:19:50,271
No, I've got nobody. Okay.

370
00:19:50,315 --> 00:19:52,565
I just need help
to get out of here.

371
00:19:52,609 --> 00:19:54,378
I can't walk out of here
with a fractured leg.

372
00:19:54,402 --> 00:19:56,569
There's just no way.

373
00:19:56,613 --> 00:20:00,907
I ask for the battery
life for search and rescues.

374
00:20:00,950 --> 00:20:04,702
If it's less than, say, 10%,

375
00:20:04,746 --> 00:20:06,787
try to keep those
phone calls brief.

376
00:20:06,831 --> 00:20:08,871
Just got to conserve
that battery life.

377
00:20:13,588 --> 00:20:15,004
Where are you right now?

378
00:20:15,048 --> 00:20:17,340
So you take the highway east.

379
00:20:17,383 --> 00:20:19,091
It's about a mile back.

380
00:20:19,135 --> 00:20:21,385
You go on the riverbed.

381
00:20:21,429 --> 00:20:23,073
There's a four-wheeler track
straight ahead.

382
00:20:23,097 --> 00:20:27,308
Because you're low on battery,
I'm gonna let you go.

383
00:20:27,352 --> 00:20:30,978
You want me
to shoot my gun in the air?

384
00:20:31,022 --> 00:20:33,439
Let's not worry about that
quite yet.

385
00:20:33,483 --> 00:20:35,483
I want you to dial 911

386
00:20:35,526 --> 00:20:36,837
if anything else does worsen
in the meanwhile.

387
00:20:36,861 --> 00:20:38,714
We're getting the help paged
out right now, okay?

388
00:20:38,738 --> 00:20:39,570
Oh, I'm disconnected.

389
00:20:39,614 --> 00:20:41,197
Did it just happen?

390
00:20:41,241 --> 00:20:42,426
Yes, just happened.

391
00:20:42,450 --> 00:20:43,677
He thinks
he has a fractured ankle.

392
00:20:43,701 --> 00:20:46,369
Can he not ride
his four-wheeler out of there?

393
00:20:46,412 --> 00:20:47,806
Yeah, no, it was
because of the accident.

394
00:20:47,830 --> 00:20:50,184
It sounds like
it's in the water.

395
00:20:50,208 --> 00:20:51,874
Is he wet?

396
00:20:51,918 --> 00:20:54,752
He was wet down to the...
Down to the waist.

397
00:20:54,796 --> 00:20:56,756
- Is he currently in the water?
- No.

398
00:21:13,982 --> 00:21:16,440
911. What is the address
of your emergency?

399
00:21:16,484 --> 00:21:20,528
Hi, this is frank.
I'm calling back in.

400
00:21:20,571 --> 00:21:23,489
Man, I feel like a total jerk.

401
00:21:23,533 --> 00:21:24,635
We've got help headed your way.

402
00:21:24,659 --> 00:21:27,451
Fire department's
bringing in some atvs.

403
00:21:27,495 --> 00:21:29,996
And we got troopers notified
as well, okay?

404
00:21:30,039 --> 00:21:30,997
Do you have any... any...
Okay, I'm sorry.

405
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:32,685
No, you don't need to be sorry.

406
00:21:32,709 --> 00:21:34,103
Okay, don't... don't waste
your time with that.

407
00:21:34,127 --> 00:21:35,646
Do you have gps coordinates
on your phone?

408
00:21:35,670 --> 00:21:37,940
I got one of those fancy phones.
I don't know how to use it.

409
00:21:37,964 --> 00:21:41,007
Can you go to your compass?

410
00:21:41,050 --> 00:21:42,736
I don't know.
I've never used the compass.

411
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:47,638
Let's see.

412
00:21:47,682 --> 00:21:53,019
Okay, my lat is
62.3235 degrees north.

413
00:21:53,062 --> 00:21:59,608
My long is
150.1203 degrees west.
Okay.

414
00:21:59,652 --> 00:22:02,903
I've got a fractured leg.
I do this all the time.

415
00:22:02,947 --> 00:22:03,654
I'm even back here bear hunting.

416
00:22:03,698 --> 00:22:05,448
This is my bear station.

417
00:22:05,491 --> 00:22:06,449
What's the percentage
on your phone?

418
00:22:06,492 --> 00:22:08,993
Darn.

419
00:22:09,037 --> 00:22:10,037
I'm on...

420
00:22:19,922 --> 00:22:22,298
You know that feeling

421
00:22:22,342 --> 00:22:23,819
when your cellphone's
about to die?

422
00:22:23,843 --> 00:22:27,428
That weird anxiety of being
cut off from the entire world?

423
00:22:27,472 --> 00:22:28,782
Well, what are you
worried about?

424
00:22:28,806 --> 00:22:31,015
Missing a text from a friend

425
00:22:31,059 --> 00:22:33,559
or checking your social media?

426
00:22:33,603 --> 00:22:36,062
Imagine it's night,

427
00:22:36,105 --> 00:22:37,666
you're in the
remote alaskan wilderness

428
00:22:37,690 --> 00:22:39,273
surrounded by grizzly bears,

429
00:22:39,317 --> 00:22:41,734
your leg's broken,

430
00:22:41,778 --> 00:22:44,445
the sun has set,
and the temperature is dropping.

431
00:22:44,489 --> 00:22:47,114
And every time you make
a call for help,

432
00:22:47,158 --> 00:22:49,950
that battery gets closer
and closer to dying.

433
00:22:57,668 --> 00:23:00,188
Did we get good
coordinates for him, miles?

434
00:23:00,213 --> 00:23:02,004
Yes, it's in there.

435
00:23:02,048 --> 00:23:03,756
In the middle of
freakin' nowhere.

436
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:05,444
That's... I told...
I mean, like,
in the middle of nowhere.

437
00:23:05,468 --> 00:23:06,342
See, that's the river.

438
00:23:06,386 --> 00:23:07,738
Those are correct coordinates?

439
00:23:07,762 --> 00:23:09,053
That's what he gave us,

440
00:23:09,097 --> 00:23:11,847
but I'm thinking maybe
he didn't get them right.

441
00:23:11,891 --> 00:23:14,078
Hey, kristen, did you give
these coordinates to them?

442
00:23:14,102 --> 00:23:16,121
We haven't given them
the coordinates yet.

443
00:23:16,145 --> 00:23:18,374
I don't think they're gonna be
able to drive there with an atv,

444
00:23:18,398 --> 00:23:20,459
if that's really where he is.

445
00:23:20,483 --> 00:23:21,357
That looks more like a helo.

446
00:23:21,401 --> 00:23:23,567
Right.

447
00:23:23,611 --> 00:23:24,902
We want to help you,

448
00:23:24,946 --> 00:23:26,737
we might be able to find you,

449
00:23:26,781 --> 00:23:29,365
but we can't get to you quickly.

450
00:23:29,409 --> 00:23:32,201
The geographic square mileage
is huge.

451
00:23:32,245 --> 00:23:33,389
Just at least let the guys
on atvs know

452
00:23:33,413 --> 00:23:34,912
that those are their coordinates

453
00:23:34,956 --> 00:23:37,581
before they go zooming out there
at night with the grizzlies.

454
00:23:43,214 --> 00:23:44,733
City of new orleans 911.

455
00:23:44,757 --> 00:23:46,652
What's the address
of your emergency?

456
00:23:46,676 --> 00:23:48,843
Yeah, I don't have the address.

457
00:23:48,886 --> 00:23:51,281
I left my daughter to sleep over
at my dad's house.
Mm-hmm.

458
00:23:51,305 --> 00:23:53,222
Then she just called me

459
00:23:53,266 --> 00:23:54,618
and told me that
my dad's not breathing

460
00:23:54,642 --> 00:23:57,101
and he's purple in the face.

461
00:23:57,145 --> 00:23:58,539
I'm... I'm on my way
back there now.

462
00:23:58,563 --> 00:24:00,980
And she... she's only 9.

463
00:24:01,023 --> 00:24:02,648
And she called me
crying herself.

464
00:24:02,692 --> 00:24:03,524
And I was like,
"I'm calling for you, baby."

465
00:24:03,568 --> 00:24:04,900
how old is your father?

466
00:24:04,944 --> 00:24:07,778
H-he's 65.

467
00:24:07,822 --> 00:24:09,800
Is he diagnosed with anything?

468
00:24:09,824 --> 00:24:11,866
I don't... let me have you
talk to my husband.

469
00:24:11,909 --> 00:24:13,909
He's got heart problems.

470
00:24:13,953 --> 00:24:15,889
Alright.
So he does have heart problems.

471
00:24:15,913 --> 00:24:17,182
Alright. I've sent this over

472
00:24:17,206 --> 00:24:19,435
to my dispatcher
to get an ambulance,

473
00:24:19,459 --> 00:24:21,520
and the fire department's
gonna go out there.

474
00:24:21,544 --> 00:24:22,418
What's your daughter's name?
'cause I'm gonna call her

475
00:24:22,462 --> 00:24:24,170
since she's on the scene

476
00:24:24,213 --> 00:24:25,899
so I can find out
further information.

477
00:24:25,923 --> 00:24:30,634
Her name's madison.
She's only 9 years old, ma'am.

478
00:24:30,678 --> 00:24:32,364
The fire department
and the ambulance

479
00:24:32,388 --> 00:24:34,783
is gonna go out there,
and I'm advising them

480
00:24:34,807 --> 00:24:36,368
that she's on scene
with him by herself.

481
00:24:36,392 --> 00:24:37,536
She's not gonna be able
to really...

482
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:39,288
How far away are you guys?

483
00:24:39,312 --> 00:24:42,813
Probably 15 minutes.

484
00:24:42,857 --> 00:24:44,001
I'm gonna give madison
a call, okay?

485
00:24:44,025 --> 00:24:45,524
Alright.

486
00:24:48,779 --> 00:24:50,591
With a child,
you have to talk slow.

487
00:24:50,615 --> 00:24:52,823
You have to talk steady.

488
00:24:52,867 --> 00:24:56,577
I have to be a little more
softer in my tone.

489
00:24:56,621 --> 00:24:58,474
With an adult,
you can be a little more direct.

490
00:24:58,498 --> 00:24:59,163
But with a child,
you don't want to scare them

491
00:24:59,198 --> 00:25:00,414
from the beginning.

492
00:25:12,386 --> 00:25:13,302
Hello?

493
00:25:13,346 --> 00:25:14,678
Hi. Is this madison?

494
00:25:14,722 --> 00:25:16,597
Yes, ma'am.

495
00:25:16,641 --> 00:25:18,911
Hi, madison. My name's amanda.

496
00:25:18,935 --> 00:25:20,537
I'm with the new orleans
police department.

497
00:25:20,561 --> 00:25:21,477
How's your grandfather?
Where is he?

498
00:25:21,521 --> 00:25:23,771
Um, he's in the room.

499
00:25:23,814 --> 00:25:26,084
Okay. Can you get next to him so
you can tell me what he's doing?

500
00:25:26,108 --> 00:25:29,235
Mm-hmm.

501
00:25:29,278 --> 00:25:30,631
Okay, I do have an ambulance
coming out to you.

502
00:25:30,655 --> 00:25:33,489
Okay.

503
00:25:33,533 --> 00:25:35,783
Let me know when you're there,
okay?

504
00:25:35,826 --> 00:25:39,370
I'm there.

505
00:25:39,413 --> 00:25:40,287
Alright, what is he doing?

506
00:25:40,331 --> 00:25:41,580
Is he's awake?

507
00:25:41,624 --> 00:25:43,541
No, ma'am.

508
00:25:43,584 --> 00:25:46,085
Is he breathing?

509
00:25:46,128 --> 00:25:50,172
Um, like, his stomach's moving,
but not a lot.

510
00:25:50,216 --> 00:25:52,027
Can I get you to do something
for me?

511
00:25:52,051 --> 00:25:54,176
Yes, ma'am.

512
00:25:54,220 --> 00:25:55,447
Alright, I want you to
tell me "now"

513
00:25:55,471 --> 00:25:57,930
every time he takes a breath in,
okay?

514
00:25:57,974 --> 00:25:59,952
So that I can calculate
his breathing.

515
00:25:59,976 --> 00:26:01,745
Okay, say "now" for me, okay?

516
00:26:01,769 --> 00:26:04,562
Okay.

517
00:26:04,605 --> 00:26:06,405
Tell me "now" every time
he takes a breath in.

518
00:26:11,988 --> 00:26:13,237
I need you to say "now"...

519
00:26:13,281 --> 00:26:14,738
I don't hear him breathing.

520
00:26:14,782 --> 00:26:19,868
Madison, can I get you to
attempt cpr on him?

521
00:26:19,912 --> 00:26:21,390
I'll tell you how to do it,

522
00:26:21,414 --> 00:26:22,975
and I'll stay
on the line with you, okay?

523
00:26:22,999 --> 00:26:24,957
Okay. Can I put you on speaker?

524
00:26:25,001 --> 00:26:26,208
Yes, please.

525
00:26:31,173 --> 00:26:32,965
Okay.

526
00:26:33,009 --> 00:26:36,510
Alright, so what is... this is
what I want you to do.

527
00:26:36,554 --> 00:26:38,031
I want you to take both
of your hands...

528
00:26:38,055 --> 00:26:40,639
Mm-hmm.

529
00:26:40,683 --> 00:26:41,910
...And I want you
to place the heel of your hand

530
00:26:41,934 --> 00:26:43,434
on the breastbone.

531
00:26:43,477 --> 00:26:46,228
That's gonna be
in between his nipples.

532
00:26:46,272 --> 00:26:50,065
Okay.
Alright, I want you to put
one hand on top of each other,

533
00:26:50,109 --> 00:26:51,628
and let me know
when you have it like that.

534
00:26:51,652 --> 00:26:53,902
I have it.

535
00:26:53,946 --> 00:26:55,716
Alright, so I want you to...

536
00:26:55,740 --> 00:26:57,718
I want you to press hard
as you can down, okay?

537
00:26:57,742 --> 00:26:59,177
And I'm gonna count with you.

538
00:26:59,201 --> 00:27:02,328
We're gonna do compressions
until help arrives.
Okay.

539
00:27:02,371 --> 00:27:03,932
We're gonna pump
the chest hard and fast,

540
00:27:03,956 --> 00:27:06,665
at least twice per second
and two inches deep.

541
00:27:06,709 --> 00:27:08,020
So I need you to
go as hard as...

542
00:27:08,044 --> 00:27:11,462
Down as hard as
you possibly can, okay?

543
00:27:11,505 --> 00:27:12,816
Okay.
Let me know
when you're ready.

544
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:14,151
I'm ready. Alright.

545
00:27:14,175 --> 00:27:18,636
We're going to start now.
One, two, three, four.

546
00:27:18,679 --> 00:27:21,513
One, two, three, four.

547
00:27:21,557 --> 00:27:23,118
Count out loud with me
so that I can know

548
00:27:23,142 --> 00:27:24,411
you're doing it correctly, okay?

549
00:27:24,435 --> 00:27:27,269
One, two, three, four.
- One, two, three.

550
00:27:27,313 --> 00:27:30,314
One, two, three, four.

551
00:27:30,358 --> 00:27:32,566
One, two, three, four.
- One, two...

552
00:27:32,610 --> 00:27:36,028
One, two, three, four.

553
00:27:36,072 --> 00:27:38,947
One, two, three, four.

554
00:27:38,991 --> 00:27:41,867
One, two, three, four.

555
00:27:41,911 --> 00:27:44,870
One, two, three, four.

556
00:27:44,914 --> 00:27:47,623
One, two, three, four.

557
00:27:47,667 --> 00:27:48,916
Are you pumping, madison?

558
00:27:50,753 --> 00:27:52,503
Madison. Yes.

559
00:27:52,546 --> 00:27:55,506
Are you pressing down hard?

560
00:27:55,549 --> 00:27:58,425
He... he's all, like,
purple in the face,

561
00:27:58,469 --> 00:28:01,220
and I can't... like,
he's spitting out water.

562
00:28:01,263 --> 00:28:02,554
So he's spitting out water?

563
00:28:02,598 --> 00:28:04,598
Mm-hmm.

564
00:28:04,642 --> 00:28:06,787
Okay, so you don't want
to continue,

565
00:28:06,811 --> 00:28:09,436
or you want to keep trying
until the help arrives?

566
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:12,147
He's making some kind of noise.

567
00:28:12,191 --> 00:28:13,524
Right, so that...

568
00:28:13,567 --> 00:28:16,360
Yeah, that means
he's agonal breathing,

569
00:28:16,404 --> 00:28:17,631
which means
he's not breathing correctly.

570
00:28:17,655 --> 00:28:19,633
So we continue the compressions
we can...

571
00:28:19,657 --> 00:28:23,075
That'll help him until the units
arrive and take over.

572
00:28:23,119 --> 00:28:25,389
I'm scared.
But if you're scared,
I understand.

573
00:28:25,413 --> 00:28:26,653
Do you want to continue?

574
00:28:28,958 --> 00:28:30,457
Madison?

575
00:28:33,170 --> 00:28:37,089
Madison?

576
00:28:37,133 --> 00:28:39,508
I'm here.

577
00:28:39,552 --> 00:28:40,904
Alright,
we're gonna continue, okay?

578
00:28:40,928 --> 00:28:42,864
One, two... count with me, okay?

579
00:28:42,888 --> 00:28:44,763
One...

580
00:28:44,807 --> 00:28:47,850
One, two, three, four.

581
00:28:47,893 --> 00:28:51,103
One, two, three, four.

582
00:28:51,147 --> 00:28:54,440
One, two, three, four.

583
00:28:54,483 --> 00:28:58,068
One, two, three, four.

584
00:28:58,112 --> 00:28:59,592
One...

585
00:29:05,327 --> 00:29:07,661
Alright, we're gonna
continue, okay?

586
00:29:07,705 --> 00:29:09,725
One, two... count with me, okay?

587
00:29:09,749 --> 00:29:11,582
One...

588
00:29:11,625 --> 00:29:14,001
One, two, three, four.

589
00:29:14,044 --> 00:29:16,712
One, two, three, four.

590
00:29:16,756 --> 00:29:19,715
One, two, three, four.

591
00:29:19,759 --> 00:29:22,509
One, two, three, four.

592
00:29:22,553 --> 00:29:25,512
One, two, three, four.

593
00:29:25,556 --> 00:29:28,599
One, two, three, four.

594
00:29:28,642 --> 00:29:31,351
One, two, three, four.

595
00:29:33,022 --> 00:29:34,624
They're here.
And also,
I talked to your mom and...

596
00:29:34,648 --> 00:29:37,107
They're here?

597
00:29:37,151 --> 00:29:38,962
They're, like, in there
with him.
Okay.

598
00:29:38,986 --> 00:29:41,361
So the fire department's there
with him?

599
00:29:41,405 --> 00:29:45,240
Mm-hmm.
And your mom and dad
are en route to you now, okay?

600
00:29:45,284 --> 00:29:46,720
I spoke with them. Okay.

601
00:29:46,744 --> 00:29:48,118
Alright. You did good.

602
00:29:48,162 --> 00:29:49,828
Okay.

603
00:29:49,872 --> 00:29:51,205
Bye-bye.

604
00:29:51,248 --> 00:29:52,915
Bye.

605
00:30:00,508 --> 00:30:02,027
If you're giving
cpr instructions,

606
00:30:02,051 --> 00:30:05,677
you may have been on the phone
for two minutes, but to me,

607
00:30:05,721 --> 00:30:08,002
it felt like I've been on there
my whole 12-hour shift.

608
00:30:10,851 --> 00:30:13,477
I mean, I never want to have to

609
00:30:13,521 --> 00:30:17,314
give a child
cpr instructions for someone.

610
00:30:17,358 --> 00:30:19,274
I love kids.

611
00:30:19,318 --> 00:30:21,735
I have 12 nieces and nephews,

612
00:30:21,779 --> 00:30:23,987
so I've been around kids
my whole life.

613
00:30:24,031 --> 00:30:26,949
A child shouldn't have
to go through that.

614
00:30:26,992 --> 00:30:29,868
She was really scared. - Mm-hmm.

615
00:30:29,912 --> 00:30:31,389
But on the call,
the father was like

616
00:30:31,413 --> 00:30:33,683
he shouldn't
have left her there.

617
00:30:33,707 --> 00:30:35,101
But he was like, he kind...
He's kind of glad

618
00:30:35,125 --> 00:30:36,311
because she was able
to get him help.

619
00:30:36,335 --> 00:30:38,688
But I feel like that's
a big responsibility

620
00:30:38,712 --> 00:30:39,461
on someone that young.

621
00:30:39,505 --> 00:30:41,713
Right.

622
00:30:41,757 --> 00:30:44,110
And she was petrified
and having to do cpr

623
00:30:44,134 --> 00:30:46,802
on an adult that...

624
00:30:46,846 --> 00:30:48,532
On her grandfather. Yeah.

625
00:30:48,556 --> 00:30:50,931
But it looks like he's okay.
He's at the hospital now.

626
00:30:50,975 --> 00:30:54,101
But...

627
00:30:54,144 --> 00:30:55,205
Well, at least I'm glad
she was there to help him.

628
00:30:55,229 --> 00:30:56,603
Mm-hmm.

629
00:31:06,323 --> 00:31:07,884
911. What's the address
of the emergency?

630
00:31:07,908 --> 00:31:13,161
This is frank. I'm just east
of the talkeetna river again.

631
00:31:13,205 --> 00:31:15,622
Doggone it, you guys got
better things to do.

632
00:31:15,666 --> 00:31:16,768
No, no, this is exactly
what we're here for.

633
00:31:16,792 --> 00:31:18,709
I-I'm sorry. No, you just relax.

634
00:31:18,752 --> 00:31:20,272
You try to stay comfortable
until we get you that help.

635
00:31:20,296 --> 00:31:21,356
I have been a call taker

636
00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:23,797
for about
two and a half years now,

637
00:31:23,841 --> 00:31:25,443
so not very long
compared to my peers.

638
00:31:25,467 --> 00:31:27,112
When I look at the people
that I work with,

639
00:31:27,136 --> 00:31:29,136
I see heroes.

640
00:31:29,179 --> 00:31:30,740
The purpose that
I was looking for,

641
00:31:30,764 --> 00:31:32,472
for serving the community,

642
00:31:32,516 --> 00:31:33,660
for making a positive difference
in lives,

643
00:31:33,684 --> 00:31:36,101
I'm finding it here.

644
00:31:36,145 --> 00:31:37,747
How are you doing on warmth?
You okay?

645
00:31:37,771 --> 00:31:39,688
Yeah. Yeah. I mean,
I'm a little bit chilled,

646
00:31:39,732 --> 00:31:40,792
but I can't walk out of here.

647
00:31:40,816 --> 00:31:41,835
Alright, you're doing
a very good job.

648
00:31:41,859 --> 00:31:43,587
You just stay right with me,
okay?

649
00:31:43,611 --> 00:31:45,694
I hear a wheeler now.

650
00:31:45,738 --> 00:31:48,196
Is that your help?

651
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:50,051
I'm not sure.
Let me double check.

652
00:31:50,075 --> 00:31:52,429
Does it sound like
that's gonna be, uh...

653
00:31:52,453 --> 00:31:53,597
I can't get ahold of my guys
on the radio.

654
00:31:53,621 --> 00:31:55,473
Okay. They're too far out.

655
00:31:55,497 --> 00:31:57,017
I keep trying to reach them,
but...
Okay.

656
00:31:57,041 --> 00:31:59,708
If you're able to do so, maybe
just try to holler for them.

657
00:31:59,752 --> 00:32:01,460
Hey!

658
00:32:04,757 --> 00:32:07,382
Hey!

659
00:32:07,426 --> 00:32:09,112
Do you have enough battery

660
00:32:09,136 --> 00:32:11,615
for me to stay on the line
with you while they get to you?

661
00:32:11,639 --> 00:32:13,513
I got 1% right now.

662
00:32:13,557 --> 00:32:15,201
I've been keeping it warm
in my underwear.

663
00:32:15,225 --> 00:32:17,476
Okay.

664
00:32:17,519 --> 00:32:18,705
Wait. They're coming towards me.
I see light.

665
00:32:18,729 --> 00:32:21,939
Lights are coming towards you?

666
00:32:21,982 --> 00:32:22,689
They must be in the river.

667
00:32:22,733 --> 00:32:24,274
Okay.

668
00:32:24,318 --> 00:32:26,109
Hey!

669
00:32:26,153 --> 00:32:28,528
Do you have any flashlights?
Anything that can make light?

670
00:32:28,572 --> 00:32:32,157
Just my phone. Hey!

671
00:32:32,201 --> 00:32:33,909
They're driving upriver from me.

672
00:32:33,953 --> 00:32:37,996
Hey! Hey!

673
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:39,915
Yeah, they're heading
away from me now.

674
00:32:41,919 --> 00:32:44,753
Help! Hey!

675
00:32:44,797 --> 00:32:46,088
Help!

676
00:32:48,759 --> 00:32:50,592
Help!

677
00:32:51,845 --> 00:32:52,845
Hey!

678
00:33:04,733 --> 00:33:06,733
City of new orleans 911.

679
00:33:06,777 --> 00:33:09,257
What's the address
of your emergency?

680
00:33:16,078 --> 00:33:17,318
Repeat for me, ma'am?

681
00:33:21,125 --> 00:33:23,406
Is anyone in danger right now?

682
00:33:30,009 --> 00:33:32,592
Man.

683
00:33:32,636 --> 00:33:34,917
Boxers hanging on his ankle?

684
00:33:36,765 --> 00:33:39,285
Okay, and what else
did you notice about him?

685
00:33:42,896 --> 00:33:44,096
What? I'm sorry.

686
00:33:50,988 --> 00:33:52,215
Alright, ma'am.
Stay on the line.

687
00:33:52,239 --> 00:33:54,639
I'm getting this
information out.

688
00:33:57,953 --> 00:34:00,328
He's naked. Who?

689
00:34:00,372 --> 00:34:01,413
The man on louisa.

690
00:34:01,457 --> 00:34:03,832
Oh, lord.

691
00:34:03,876 --> 00:34:05,270
Well, the sun not out,
so it can't be a suntan.

692
00:34:05,294 --> 00:34:06,414
Not trying to get no suntan.

693
00:34:12,259 --> 00:34:13,653
Alright, I do apologize
for the silence, ma'am.

694
00:34:13,677 --> 00:34:16,823
Just getting
the information out.
That's okay.

695
00:34:16,847 --> 00:34:18,408
I am having someone sent over
to the location.

696
00:34:18,432 --> 00:34:19,868
Okay. Alright. Thank you, ma'am.

697
00:34:19,892 --> 00:34:21,475
Alright.

698
00:34:21,518 --> 00:34:24,019
Mm. They do some weird stuff
in this city, child.

699
00:34:24,063 --> 00:34:25,063
I sent them some help.

700
00:34:27,566 --> 00:34:28,766
They out early.

701
00:34:30,736 --> 00:34:34,154
Every 911 call
has a unique twist,

702
00:34:34,198 --> 00:34:37,616
challenge, or puzzle
to decipher.

703
00:34:37,659 --> 00:34:40,786
Technology helps our call takers
communicate.

704
00:34:40,829 --> 00:34:43,016
Austin 911. Do you need
police, fire, or ems?

705
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:45,749
I need police.

706
00:34:45,793 --> 00:34:48,418
It helps them
locate the person in need.

707
00:34:48,462 --> 00:34:51,171
Okay, what's going on right now
at that location?

708
00:34:51,215 --> 00:34:53,151
Tracking technology
can even reassure a caller

709
00:34:53,175 --> 00:34:54,527
that help is just moments away.

710
00:34:54,551 --> 00:34:56,362
They're coming to
you right now, okay?

711
00:34:56,386 --> 00:34:58,220
Don't panic.

712
00:34:58,263 --> 00:35:00,972
Okay. Thank you so much.

713
00:35:01,016 --> 00:35:02,452
But there's no computer
on the planet

714
00:35:02,476 --> 00:35:06,561
that can replace the empathy
or determination it takes

715
00:35:06,605 --> 00:35:08,730
to truly get to the bottom
of every story.

716
00:35:16,031 --> 00:35:19,866
Austin 911. This is austin 911.
Do you have an emergency?

717
00:35:19,910 --> 00:35:23,203
Somebody just rang my doorbell

718
00:35:23,247 --> 00:35:26,123
at this late hour,
and they're wearing a mask.

719
00:35:26,166 --> 00:35:28,041
Okay.

720
00:35:28,085 --> 00:35:31,211
So it's somebody
that has a mask on.

721
00:35:31,255 --> 00:35:34,714
Okay.

722
00:35:34,758 --> 00:35:37,717
And is it just
yourself in the home?
Yes.

723
00:35:37,761 --> 00:35:39,841
Baker 704 is advising
on a suspicious person.

724
00:35:45,477 --> 00:35:46,955
You're doing a great job, okay?

725
00:35:46,979 --> 00:35:47,686
I already have help on the way,
okay?

726
00:35:47,729 --> 00:35:49,646
Okay.

727
00:35:49,690 --> 00:35:50,522
Can you see where they are now?

728
00:35:50,566 --> 00:35:52,607
Are they still there?

729
00:35:52,651 --> 00:35:56,695
I'm too afraid to look
through the window.

730
00:35:56,738 --> 00:35:58,864
He keeps looking through
my window in the kitchen.

731
00:35:58,907 --> 00:36:02,492
That's what scared me.

732
00:36:02,536 --> 00:36:04,305
He's been to the front door
three times

733
00:36:04,329 --> 00:36:06,538
and around to the side,

734
00:36:06,582 --> 00:36:08,999
I think only once,
but I don't know for sure.

735
00:36:09,042 --> 00:36:12,627
Were you able to see any weapons
on him at all?

736
00:36:12,671 --> 00:36:15,547
Uh, they looked to be carrying
a lot of cloth.

737
00:36:15,591 --> 00:36:17,591
Carrying cloth?

738
00:36:17,634 --> 00:36:18,925
Yeah.

739
00:36:30,856 --> 00:36:31,916
The officers are coming
as fast as they can, okay?

740
00:36:31,940 --> 00:36:35,609
Okay.

741
00:36:35,652 --> 00:36:37,255
Do you remember
if they had all tried

742
00:36:37,279 --> 00:36:38,236
to get inside of your home?
No, not yet.

743
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:39,696
Okay.

744
00:36:39,740 --> 00:36:43,241
They're now walking down
the driveway, but very slowly.

745
00:36:43,285 --> 00:36:44,576
They're not leaving.

746
00:36:44,620 --> 00:36:46,848
Okay, and can you see anything
about the suspect?

747
00:36:46,872 --> 00:36:48,413
How tall they are?

748
00:36:48,457 --> 00:36:49,331
Any kind of clothing
description?

749
00:36:49,374 --> 00:36:49,956
If they're dark colors?

750
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,375
Okay.

751
00:36:52,419 --> 00:36:54,836
He's sitting in my yard.

752
00:36:57,507 --> 00:36:59,841
Oh, lord, god.

753
00:36:59,885 --> 00:37:03,220
Did it appear that he was
intoxicated or on drugs

754
00:37:03,263 --> 00:37:04,949
or having mental health issues

755
00:37:04,973 --> 00:37:07,333
or any...
Any kind of injured at all?

756
00:37:09,561 --> 00:37:11,831
Okay. Officers are coming
as fast as they can.

757
00:37:11,855 --> 00:37:13,208
They're on allandale, okay?

758
00:37:20,113 --> 00:37:21,821
Oh, man.

759
00:37:26,828 --> 00:37:29,746
Hello?

760
00:37:29,790 --> 00:37:32,707
Are you still there?

761
00:37:32,751 --> 00:37:34,251
Yes.

762
00:37:34,294 --> 00:37:37,003
Okay.

763
00:37:37,047 --> 00:37:39,150
What are you seeing and hearing?

764
00:37:39,174 --> 00:37:43,134
They may be gone.

765
00:37:43,178 --> 00:37:44,739
We're gonna check the area
and make sure.

766
00:37:44,763 --> 00:37:46,221
They're almost there.

767
00:37:48,392 --> 00:37:49,392
Oh, my god!

768
00:37:50,686 --> 00:37:53,144
Okay.

769
00:37:53,188 --> 00:37:55,588
Okay. Okay.
Oh, god. They're coming back.

770
00:37:56,900 --> 00:37:59,192
You should be seeing officers
here in just a minute.

771
00:38:06,994 --> 00:38:08,868
I don't blame you at all.

772
00:38:08,912 --> 00:38:11,272
Can you see or hear
anything else?

773
00:38:15,335 --> 00:38:16,535
What's going on?

774
00:38:22,342 --> 00:38:25,385
Oh, my god!
He's back up in the driveway!

775
00:38:25,429 --> 00:38:27,429
Okay.

776
00:38:27,472 --> 00:38:28,847
Oh, god. They're coming back.

777
00:38:31,018 --> 00:38:33,685
You should be seeing officers
here in just a minute.

778
00:38:36,982 --> 00:38:38,418
Can you see or hear
anything else from where you are

779
00:38:38,442 --> 00:38:41,109
without going outside or
making yourself uncomfortable?

780
00:38:43,864 --> 00:38:46,072
What's going on?

781
00:38:47,951 --> 00:38:51,911
I think it might be my...
My sister.

782
00:38:51,955 --> 00:38:53,246
It's your sister?

783
00:38:53,290 --> 00:38:55,332
Oh, my god.

784
00:38:58,837 --> 00:39:00,957
Can you tell if it's your sister
right now?

785
00:39:02,007 --> 00:39:03,089
Beverly?

786
00:39:06,261 --> 00:39:08,386
My god.

787
00:39:08,430 --> 00:39:10,305
You scared
the living crap out of me.

788
00:39:17,647 --> 00:39:19,334
I'm glad it...
It all worked out.

789
00:39:19,358 --> 00:39:20,710
Go ahead and speak
with the officer.

790
00:39:20,734 --> 00:39:22,003
Call back if anything changes,
okay?

791
00:39:22,027 --> 00:39:24,152
Thank you. I'm so sorry.

792
00:39:24,196 --> 00:39:24,778
You're welcome, ma'am. Bye-bye.

793
00:39:24,821 --> 00:39:26,571
Thank you.

794
00:39:29,701 --> 00:39:32,952
Ah, priceless.

795
00:39:32,996 --> 00:39:34,836
It's the complainant's sister.

796
00:39:34,873 --> 00:39:37,060
Can't. I can't with people.

797
00:39:37,084 --> 00:39:38,958
She said he had, like,
a bag of clothes

798
00:39:39,002 --> 00:39:39,959
or something like that,
and I was just like...

799
00:39:40,003 --> 00:39:41,189
She thought it was a murder bag?

800
00:39:41,213 --> 00:39:42,629
Funny.

801
00:39:48,261 --> 00:39:52,680
Hey!

802
00:39:52,724 --> 00:39:56,184
Hey!

803
00:39:56,228 --> 00:39:57,538
It's been just over an hour

804
00:39:57,562 --> 00:40:00,313
since a stranded bear hunter
called 911.

805
00:40:00,357 --> 00:40:03,858
Help! Help!

806
00:40:03,902 --> 00:40:05,652
Yeah!

807
00:40:05,695 --> 00:40:08,780
Yeah!
Yeah? I think
someone responded to him.

808
00:40:08,824 --> 00:40:11,866
Ooh, really? We have a response?

809
00:40:11,910 --> 00:40:13,304
Somebody yelled back?
Yeah, somebody yelled.

810
00:40:13,328 --> 00:40:15,495
No, I'm across the river!

811
00:40:15,539 --> 00:40:17,997
Downstream!

812
00:40:18,041 --> 00:40:19,644
They're talking to me now,
so they know I'm here.

813
00:40:19,668 --> 00:40:21,813
Okay. Okay, that's good.

814
00:40:21,837 --> 00:40:23,773
I'm gonna be right here
on the line with you.

815
00:40:23,797 --> 00:40:26,214
I think the fire chief is here
with me now.

816
00:40:26,258 --> 00:40:28,049
He's in contact with you?

817
00:40:28,093 --> 00:40:30,301
- Sweet.
- Whoo-hoo!

818
00:40:30,345 --> 00:40:31,905
Don't make that noise
in the background.

819
00:40:33,473 --> 00:40:34,389
Alright, sir, I'm gonna
go ahead and let you go

820
00:40:34,433 --> 00:40:36,619
since he does have eyes on you.

821
00:40:36,643 --> 00:40:37,703
Okay. Okay.
Hey, what's your name?

822
00:40:37,727 --> 00:40:38,496
My name is miles.

823
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:42,021
Miles. Thank you, miles.

824
00:40:42,065 --> 00:40:44,001
Oh... thank you very much.

825
00:40:44,025 --> 00:40:44,983
Oh, thank... thank you, sir.
I'm glad you're okay.

826
00:40:45,026 --> 00:40:46,712
Stay safe out there. Bye-bye.

827
00:40:46,736 --> 00:40:49,132
He says he actually
recognizes the guy.

828
00:40:49,156 --> 00:40:50,466
- Of course.
- He used to be fire department.

829
00:40:50,490 --> 00:40:52,093
It's like the chief
or something, so...
Sweet.

830
00:40:52,117 --> 00:40:53,575
Yay!

831
00:40:53,618 --> 00:40:54,868
Good job, miles.

832
00:40:54,911 --> 00:40:57,311
No, good job, everybody.
Good job, everybody.

833
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:01,332
For a search and rescue call,

834
00:41:01,376 --> 00:41:02,895
the fact that
someone is able to call

835
00:41:02,919 --> 00:41:04,647
from out in the middle
of nowhere

836
00:41:04,671 --> 00:41:07,172
and speak to me directly is
the biggest asset that we have.

837
00:41:07,215 --> 00:41:10,633
So even in the worst situations,

838
00:41:10,677 --> 00:41:13,094
people just know
"all I got to do is dial 911,"

839
00:41:13,138 --> 00:41:15,258
and we stand a very good chance
of finding you.

840
