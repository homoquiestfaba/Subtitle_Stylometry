St. Joseph,

9
00:00:36,704 --> 00:00:39,206
there were two ordinary people

10

who were destined
to be together,

11
00:00:41,341 --> 00:00:44,378

You just walk up there
and you ring that doorbell.

21
00:01:08,002 --> 00:01:10,337
Yeah, if you don't do it,
you little twit,

22
00:01:10,370 --> 00:01:11,839

I'm actually supposed to be
inside right now for your big surprise.

- Well, you were late.
- I couldn't get the costume on!

00:08:18,065 --> 00:08:19,800
<i>about her past.</i>

180
00:08:27,508 --> 00:08:31,012
<i>She never did find records
about her parents.</i>

181
00:08:31,112 --> 00:08:33,981
<i>But she did find something
left behind.</i>

182
00:08:37,818 --> 00:08:40,521
<i>So, for almost 30 years,</i>

183
00:08:40,621 --> 00:08:42,690
<i>she searched and searched</i>

184
00:08:42,790 --> 00:08:45,026
<i>for clues to her family tree.</i>

185
00:08:45,126 --> 00:08:48,429
<i>And so this is where
I'll leave you,</i>

186
00:08:48,462 --> 00:08:52,133
<i>one day, three hours,
and 12 seconds</i>

187
00:08:52,199 --> 00:08:54,635
<i>before Olivia meets Alex,</i>

188
00:08:54,668 --> 00:08:56,837
<i>that café guy.</i>

189
00:08:59,473 --> 00:09:02,943
- [keying]
- Okay, you do realize

190
00:09:02,977 --> 00:09:05,646
you don't get paid more
for working late.

191
00:09:05,679 --> 00:09:07,782
Hey, girl. Yeah, I know.

192
00:09:07,815 --> 00:09:09,383
I'm starving.

193
00:09:09,483 --> 00:09:11,485
All right, see ya.

194
00:09:12,853 --> 00:09:13,854
[man] Anybody left?

195
00:09:13,954 --> 00:09:15,890
Yes, me, back here.

196
00:09:15,990 --> 00:09:19,528
Ah, I take it the Internet quit
working at your apartment.

197
00:09:19,627 --> 00:09:20,995
Hey, Oscar.

198
00:09:21,028 --> 00:09:23,164
No, I'm just sitting here
trying to figure out

199
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:26,033
why I haven't received
my DNA test results yet.

200
00:09:26,133 --> 00:09:28,669
And all of our other clients
have received theirs,

201
00:09:28,702 --> 00:09:31,672
except mine's the only one
that's actually having issues.

202
00:09:31,705 --> 00:09:33,340
Well, I'm sure it's on its way.

203
00:09:33,407 --> 00:09:35,376
Um, but I'll keep an eye out.

204
00:09:35,476 --> 00:09:37,178
[sighs]

205
00:09:37,244 --> 00:09:39,213
Hey!

206
00:09:41,816 --> 00:09:46,253
You'll find your family
sooner than you think.

207
00:09:46,353 --> 00:09:51,392
Yeah. Just remember, pound
on every door until it opens...

208
00:09:51,492 --> 00:09:52,527
I know.

209
00:09:52,561 --> 00:09:54,495
...or you knock it down!

210
00:09:54,529 --> 00:09:55,729
[Oscar laughs]

211
00:09:55,830 --> 00:09:57,364
You've been saying that
since I was little.

212
00:09:57,398 --> 00:09:59,200
And one day you'll believe it.

213
00:09:59,266 --> 00:10:00,067
Maybe.

214
00:10:00,167 --> 00:10:03,003
I've got something for you.

215
00:10:03,037 --> 00:10:04,338
[clears throat]

216
00:10:04,371 --> 00:10:08,209
Today is your 12th-year
anniversary.

217
00:10:08,242 --> 00:10:10,044
Now, I wish it could be more.

218
00:10:10,077 --> 00:10:12,913
Oscar, you know, you really don't
have to keep giving me money.

219
00:10:13,013 --> 00:10:17,051
I mean, I actually am caught
up on all my bills this month.

220
00:10:17,118 --> 00:10:18,553
Who else can I spoil?

221
00:10:18,652 --> 00:10:20,421
My wife and I
never had any kids,

222
00:10:20,522 --> 00:10:24,358
and you're the closest thing
I have to a grandchild.

223
00:10:24,391 --> 00:10:26,694
[sighs]

224
00:10:26,727 --> 00:10:28,530
Merry Christmas!

225
00:10:28,563 --> 00:10:30,865
It's July?

226
00:10:30,898 --> 00:10:32,466
[Oscar sighs]

227
00:10:32,567 --> 00:10:35,803
I'll see you later.
You got the keys to lock up?

228
00:10:35,903 --> 00:10:37,738
Uh, yeah.

229
00:10:37,771 --> 00:10:39,406
No, I don't.

230
00:10:40,875 --> 00:10:43,077
I'll see you on Monday.
[laughs]

231
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:45,079
I love you, kid.

232
00:10:47,081 --> 00:10:50,084
[sighs] I love you too, Oscar.

233
00:10:51,685 --> 00:10:54,255
[rhythm-and-blues playing]

234
00:10:54,288 --> 00:10:56,657
So, what's up?
Okay, so, get this.

235
00:10:56,757 --> 00:10:59,594
- So I hand this lady her heritage chest, right?
- Mm-hmm.

236
00:10:59,628 --> 00:11:03,063
And she starts bawling her eyes
out because of her deceased husband.

237
00:11:03,097 --> 00:11:05,065
It was seriously
the sweetest thing.

238
00:11:05,099 --> 00:11:08,936
That is so sweet, and that is what
I want, a long-term relationship.

239
00:11:08,969 --> 00:11:11,972
But Jerry's just, like, can't figure it
out. He's stuck in bachelor mode.

240
00:11:12,072 --> 00:11:15,109
Well, you boys didn't have
a problem committing, did you?

241
00:11:15,176 --> 00:11:16,645
No, you didn't. No...

242
00:11:16,744 --> 00:11:18,613
Okay, how do I look?

243
00:11:18,679 --> 00:11:23,184
Uh, I mean, great. But you don't
need to get dressed up for me.

244
00:11:23,284 --> 00:11:25,620
It's just pizza and movie
with the boys.

245
00:11:25,654 --> 00:11:26,954
[knock on door]

246
00:11:26,987 --> 00:11:28,255
- Come in.
- Wait!

247
00:11:28,289 --> 00:11:30,291
- What?
- Livs, I told you on Monday.

248
00:11:30,324 --> 00:11:32,793
Movie night with Jerry
on Friday.

249
00:11:32,826 --> 00:11:34,795
- It's a Friday.
- Oh.

250
00:11:34,828 --> 00:11:37,264
Yeah. No, that makes sense.

251
00:11:37,298 --> 00:11:40,801
I thought, you know,
you meant you, me,

252
00:11:40,834 --> 00:11:43,270
movie with... the boys.

253
00:11:43,304 --> 00:11:45,339
- Oh.
- Just must have got my men confused.

254
00:11:45,439 --> 00:11:47,808
- Hey, Liv. Hey, babe.
- Hey there, hi!

255
00:11:47,841 --> 00:11:50,811
Listen, I just need, like,
half a second.

256
00:11:50,878 --> 00:11:54,549
Well, honey, you look fine.
We're gonna be late. Uh...

257
00:11:54,649 --> 00:11:56,518
[whispering] She does this
all the time.

258
00:11:56,618 --> 00:11:59,588
- Yeah.
- Can't find the right rose-colored lipstick.

259
00:11:59,688 --> 00:12:01,956
- I know, yeah.
- Just keep it on you at all times.

260
00:12:01,989 --> 00:12:03,558
It's a thing, it's a real thing.

261
00:12:03,658 --> 00:12:05,392
Okay!

262
00:12:05,492 --> 00:12:06,794
Oh.

263
00:12:06,827 --> 00:12:08,395
Livs, I'm sorry.

264
00:12:08,495 --> 00:12:09,664
Next week?

265
00:12:09,698 --> 00:12:11,332
Yeah, sure.
Yeah, it-it's fine.

266
00:12:11,398 --> 00:12:12,733
You guys go and have fun.

267
00:12:12,833 --> 00:12:15,169
I've got these guys
to keep me company.

268
00:12:15,202 --> 00:12:17,371
- Great, let's go.
- Yep.

269
00:12:18,506 --> 00:12:19,807
Bye!

270
00:12:21,509 --> 00:12:22,810
[sighs]

271
00:12:22,843 --> 00:12:26,180
All right, pizza, ice cream?
Our secret?

272
00:12:26,247 --> 00:12:28,349
With syrup, let's go.

273
00:12:28,382 --> 00:12:32,119
[TV reporter] <i>...a joyride in
what police say was a stolen car...</i>

[peaceful music rising
over newscast]

275
00:12:38,526 --> 00:12:41,061
[sirens wailing, horns blaring]

276
00:12:41,161 --> 00:12:44,398
Okay, okay, don't panic, don't
panic, don't panic! All right, all right.

277
00:12:44,498 --> 00:12:47,368
Hello, hello? Olivia?
Olivia, pick up.

278
00:12:47,401 --> 00:12:49,704
Pick up. Olivia! Pick up!

279
00:12:49,738 --> 00:12:52,773
- [upbeat ringtone playing]
- [Olivia] Whoo-whoo-whoo!

280
00:12:52,873 --> 00:12:54,942
[coughing]

Pick up, pick up!

[coughs]

285
00:13:03,417 --> 00:13:05,953
- Hello?
<i>- Ah, Olivia! Hey, it's Tim.</i>

286
00:13:06,053 --> 00:13:08,255
[laughing] Hey!

287

<i>- Um...</i>
- Hi, what's up?

00:13:10,759 --> 00:13:12,226
<i>My car</i>

289
00:13:12,293 --> 00:13:15,095
blew up, and I'm in Kansas City.

290
00:13:15,195 --> 00:13:17,565
Tim, I'm kind of busy right now.

291
00:13:17,599 --> 00:13:19,900
- [truck beeping]
<i>- Olivia!</i>

292
00:13:19,933 --> 00:13:22,537
We both know you're never busy.

293
00:13:22,570 --> 00:13:27,074
Not to be rude, but you're
probably burning cookies, again.

294
00:13:27,107 --> 00:13:30,377
Okay, kid, I think
that looks good.

295
00:13:30,411 --> 00:13:32,614
You know, the client
I've been working on

296
00:13:32,714 --> 00:13:34,915
for, like, months?

297
00:13:34,982 --> 00:13:36,917
Yeah, the Benjamins.

298
00:13:36,950 --> 00:13:38,252
<i>No, no, no!</i>

299
00:13:38,285 --> 00:13:39,420
<i>The Baileys!</i>

300
00:13:39,486 --> 00:13:41,155
<i>They've got someone</i>

301
00:13:41,255 --> 00:13:43,924
picking up their heritage chest
from the airport later today

302
00:13:43,957 --> 00:13:46,927
in, like, 20 minutes.

303
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:48,262
I can't be there.

304
00:13:48,329 --> 00:13:52,099
Okay, well...?

305
00:13:52,132 --> 00:13:56,571
Can you meet the lady
at the office?

306
00:13:56,604 --> 00:13:57,572
What?

307
00:13:57,605 --> 00:14:00,274
<i>Olivia, I really need</i>

308
00:14:00,341 --> 00:14:01,909
this favor.

309
00:14:01,942 --> 00:14:04,845
If I mess up one more project,
Oscar's gonna fire me!

310
00:14:04,945 --> 00:14:06,947
<i>Oh, um, all right,
fine, fine, fine!</i>

311
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:09,784
I'll do it. I will go to the
office and meet your person.

312
00:14:09,850 --> 00:14:14,188
<i>So, the lady's name
is Olivia Bailey.</i>

313
00:14:14,288 --> 00:14:15,989
<i>She'll be there around</i>

314
00:14:16,090 --> 00:14:17,458
2 p.m. from the airport.

315
00:14:17,491 --> 00:14:20,294
She just needs
the heritage chest.

316
00:14:20,361 --> 00:14:23,430
Olivia Bailey,
Bailey heritage chest, 2 p.m.

317
00:14:23,464 --> 00:14:26,266
Got it. I'll be there.

318
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:28,469
- [phone beeps]
- Thank you, thank you, Olivia.

319
00:14:28,536 --> 00:14:30,137
You don't know
how much this means.

320
00:14:30,170 --> 00:14:34,642
I mean, I mean, I mean,
maybe you and I should like...

321
00:14:34,709 --> 00:14:37,144
celebrate some time, you know?

322
00:14:37,211 --> 00:14:39,213
Like you, me,
a candlelit dinner,

323
00:14:39,313 --> 00:14:40,682
maybe some spaghetti.

324
00:14:42,182 --> 00:14:43,484
Olivia.

325
00:14:43,551 --> 00:14:45,486
Is this some fake hang-up?

326
00:14:45,553 --> 00:14:48,857
Is this a fake hang-up?
[laughs]

327
00:14:48,956 --> 00:14:50,692
Okay, it's real.

328
00:14:51,959 --> 00:14:53,561
[engine revs]

329
00:14:55,963 --> 00:14:58,499
"Hey, Olivia, you wanna go
downtown and help me with my client?"

330
00:14:58,533 --> 00:15:00,568
"Yeah, would you just like
to give up your free night,

331
00:15:00,668 --> 00:15:02,704
your weekend,
to go help my client?"

332
00:15:02,804 --> 00:15:04,371
No, Tim, I don't.

333
00:15:04,471 --> 00:15:06,340
"Olivia, why don't
you ever have a boyfriend?"

334
00:15:06,407 --> 00:15:10,477
Because of people like you, Tim.
I'm always cleaning up your messes.

335
00:15:10,512 --> 00:15:13,515
Ah, man, thank you, man.
Thank you so much.

336
00:15:13,548 --> 00:15:15,583
Sure, sure. Hop in.

337
00:15:15,683 --> 00:15:16,885
Yes, sir.

338
00:15:21,856 --> 00:15:23,323
[sighs]

[clock ticking]

340
00:15:28,929 --> 00:15:32,567
Yeah, of course. Just...

341
00:15:34,368 --> 00:15:35,904

- [Tim] <i>Hey, Olivia.</i>
- Hey.

344
00:15:41,275 --> 00:15:43,076
Your lady never showed up.

345
00:15:43,177 --> 00:15:44,712
<i>She never showed up? What?</i>

346
00:15:44,779 --> 00:15:47,882
Yeah. Been sitting here
for over an hour, and no show.

347
00:15:47,948 --> 00:15:49,551
<i>Oh, no. No, no, no, no.</i>

348

reunion thingie tonight.</i>

to be there.</i>

<i>Now, maybe I can
get there later and...</i>

00:16:08,570 --> 00:16:11,038
You've got to be kidding me.

<i>It's the right thing to do.</i>

358
00:16:12,473 --> 00:16:14,074

<i>Let me take the mantel.
Let me take...</i>

360
00:16:16,443 --> 00:16:18,546

Been wearing them for years.

Where are <i>my</i> clothes?

412
00:18:47,528 --> 00:18:49,063
Well, we're washing them.

Where am I?

00:18:54,702 --> 00:18:57,471
You're home now, dearie.

Nana, where do you keep

Oh, well, they're
with my power tools.

Oh, Olivia,
I'm so glad to meet you.

We've got coffee

Help yourself to a cup

You know, I'm...
I'm really sorry

see me like this.

Are you kidding me?
We're family.

Okay, um, okay, okay.

that, hey, this was
just a big misunderstanding.

But what if Alex
doesn't find it funny?

459
00:20:54,989 --> 00:20:57,892
What if Alex gets mad
and what if...

460

what if he says he never
wants to see me again

461
00:21:00,427 --> 00:21:02,230
because he thinks that I lied?

462
00:21:04,397 --> 00:21:05,833
No, scrap that.

463

Can't do that one.

I'm so sorry.
I didn't mean to startle you.

474

Whoo, you got me there.

475
00:21:36,396 --> 00:21:40,034
Um... I was just, um...
I was looking for my clothes.

Finally!

- Are you feeling all right?
- Oh, yes, yes.

485
00:22:04,125 --> 00:22:05,425
Um... better.

486
00:22:05,458 --> 00:22:08,729
Well, we were all
so afraid when you fainted.

487
00:22:08,763 --> 00:22:12,399
And I told the boys I'm nervous
about such a big surprise like that.

488
00:22:12,432 --> 00:22:15,335
- Hmm.
- And that's what I said. I said, "This is a bad idea."

489
00:22:15,435 --> 00:22:18,739
- Hey, nobody listens to me.
- Olivia, that's Mike, my husband.

490
00:22:18,773 --> 00:22:20,842
- [Mike] Hey.
- Hello.

491
00:22:20,942 --> 00:22:24,278
You're gonna learn that these young
knuckleheads have no shortage of bad ideas.

492
00:22:24,312 --> 00:22:26,346
I don't even know who's worse:
Alex, Eric.

493
00:22:26,446 --> 00:22:28,816
Hey, don't worry about it.
Got your back.

494
00:22:28,916 --> 00:22:31,752
Have you met Beverly yet?

495
00:22:31,786 --> 00:22:35,756
Yes, um, she actually lent me
her nightgown.

496
00:22:35,790 --> 00:22:38,092
Oh! Is that what that is?
[laughs]

497
00:22:38,125 --> 00:22:42,163
I thought for a second you both
had the same taste in clothes.

498
00:22:42,263 --> 00:22:44,298
- [laughing]
- Comin' through!

499
00:22:44,332 --> 00:22:46,300
- Whoa!
- Hi. Could you sleep well?

500
00:22:46,366 --> 00:22:48,803
Eric, do you have to drag
those things through the kitchen?

501
00:22:48,836 --> 00:22:52,106
- [Eric] Nana wants it up.
- [Mike] Guys, do you have to go through the kitchen?

502
00:22:52,139 --> 00:22:54,275
Hey, we got the, uh,
bathroom mirror installed.

503
00:22:54,308 --> 00:22:57,979
Looks amazing,
and Nana loves it.

504
00:23:00,047 --> 00:23:04,451
- Sorry.
- Hey, Olivia, where are you staying while you're in town?

505
00:23:04,484 --> 00:23:05,987
Um...

506
00:23:06,053 --> 00:23:07,788
Don't answer that,
you're welcome to stay with us.

507
00:23:07,822 --> 00:23:11,158
Or at Alex's place. He has
a lovely home on Crestview.

508
00:23:11,225 --> 00:23:13,393
Oh, Mom, she doesn't
want to stay with me.

509
00:23:13,493 --> 00:23:16,330
- Oh. - I mean, you can if you want.
- [Olivia] Uh...

510
00:23:16,396 --> 00:23:18,966
Actually, you know,
I have, um...

511
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:23,504
I've got a friend here, and
I can just, I'll stay with her.

512
00:23:23,537 --> 00:23:25,339
Oh, well, that's wonderful.

513
00:23:25,405 --> 00:23:28,843
Okay, Mike, why don't you write
down all our numbers for Olivia?

514
00:23:28,876 --> 00:23:30,878
- [ringtone playing]
- I'm on it.

515
00:23:30,978 --> 00:23:32,513
Oh, oh, um, you know what?

516
00:23:32,546 --> 00:23:35,149
I gotta, I'm gonna take
this call, so I'll just...

517
00:23:35,182 --> 00:23:37,551
Important, so, excuse me.
Okay. [laughs]

518

[indistinct chatter]

519
00:23:39,020 --> 00:23:41,322
Olivia, oh, my gosh.
Where are you?

520
00:23:41,355 --> 00:23:43,724
I've been trying
to reach you all night.

521
00:23:43,824 --> 00:23:45,893
Sofi, Sofi, Sofi,
Sofi, listen to me.

522
00:23:45,993 --> 00:23:49,697
[sighs] Last night,
things got really complicated.

523
00:23:49,764 --> 00:23:52,366
<i>I'm running around the house.
They're inside the house.</i>

524
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:53,433
Just...

525
00:23:53,534 --> 00:23:55,002
Okay.

526
00:23:55,036 --> 00:23:57,204
Um, okay, okay, um...

527
00:23:57,271 --> 00:24:01,509
So, last night I was trying
to deliver the heritage box

528
00:24:01,542 --> 00:24:03,110
to one of our clients, okay?

529
00:24:03,210 --> 00:24:05,746
And, um, I just freaked out

530
00:24:05,846 --> 00:24:08,182
because one
of the family members

531
00:24:08,215 --> 00:24:11,519
is the same guy that I've
been stalking at the café.

532
00:24:11,552 --> 00:24:14,121
[inhales sharply] The café guy?

533
00:24:14,221 --> 00:24:17,058
The one with the perfect style
that you never talk to?

534
00:24:17,091 --> 00:24:19,193
Yes! The same one.

535
00:24:19,226 --> 00:24:22,063
Oh, God, I think I'm drowning.

536
00:24:22,096 --> 00:24:24,398
[breathes loudly] Okay, no.

537
00:24:24,432 --> 00:24:25,900
<i>No, that's not even
the worst part.</i>

538
00:24:25,933 --> 00:24:27,268
<i>Somehow I faint,</i>

539
00:24:27,368 --> 00:24:30,137
and they think I'm
their long-lost relative.

540
00:24:30,237 --> 00:24:33,074
Guess what her name is?
Olivia.

541
00:24:33,107 --> 00:24:35,876
<i>I want to tell them, um,
'cause if I'm being honest,</i>

542
00:24:35,910 --> 00:24:37,812
I want to stay and get to know
the hot café guy.

543
00:24:37,912 --> 00:24:42,482
[sighs] - Actually, I think that
this is a perfect situation for you

544
00:24:42,583 --> 00:24:46,253
because... this might be
your destiny falling into place.

545
00:24:46,287 --> 00:24:47,254
<i>Yeah!</i>

546
00:24:47,288 --> 00:24:49,924
[woman on-screen] Probably not.

547
00:24:49,957 --> 00:24:52,059
I mean, he's got a normal job,

548
00:24:52,093 --> 00:24:53,728
and I like things, I like money.

549
00:24:53,761 --> 00:24:55,229
Does that make me superficial?

550
00:24:55,262 --> 00:24:57,398
- [horn beeps]
- Okay, yeah, I could do this.

551
00:24:57,431 --> 00:24:59,967
[woman] I mean,
he's sweet and he's cute

552
00:25:00,067 --> 00:25:02,103
in his own little
awkward kind of way,

553
00:25:02,136 --> 00:25:04,905
but do I want to spend
the rest of my life with him?

554
00:25:04,939 --> 00:25:06,774
Probably not.

555
00:25:06,841 --> 00:25:08,776
Hey, did we cut out? Hello?

556
00:25:08,843 --> 00:25:10,444
Hello... Olivia?

557
00:25:10,511 --> 00:25:13,080
[woman] I was going to break
things off, but then I found out

558
00:25:13,114 --> 00:25:14,982
that his parents,
they're giving us, like,

559
00:25:15,082 --> 00:25:17,418
this huge mansion
as a wedding present,

560
00:25:17,451 --> 00:25:20,821
and I was like, "Ch-ching,
sign me up." [laughs]

561
00:25:20,888 --> 00:25:22,523
We get married.

562
00:25:22,623 --> 00:25:24,792
Couple months later, we divorce,

563
00:25:24,825 --> 00:25:26,927
and half that house is mine.

564
00:25:26,961 --> 00:25:28,963
It's worth it, right?

565
00:25:29,030 --> 00:25:30,798
- [Sofi] <i>Olivia?</i>
- Sofi!

566
00:25:30,831 --> 00:25:32,366
<i>Hello?</i>

567
00:25:32,466 --> 00:25:34,268
Hey, Olivia!

568
00:25:34,301 --> 00:25:36,303
Look, I'll call you back later.

569
00:25:36,370 --> 00:25:39,840
I'll head back
to the apartment soon, okay?

570
00:25:39,940 --> 00:25:43,044
Am I shallow?
Okay, I didn't think so.

571
00:25:43,144 --> 00:25:45,012
- But this house...
- Dang.

572
00:25:45,112 --> 00:25:48,649
- ...I hear it is very big and very expensive.
- Feel bad for that guy.

573
00:25:48,716 --> 00:25:51,719
Hey, I'd better let you go.
Okay, yeah, I've gotta see him.

574
00:25:51,819 --> 00:25:53,487
Yeah, put on my smile. Bye.

575
00:25:58,492 --> 00:26:00,861
I went ahead and pulled these
from the dryer.

576
00:26:00,961 --> 00:26:02,163
Okay, thank you.

577
00:26:02,229 --> 00:26:03,964
Uh, Olivia, uh, real quick.

578
00:26:03,998 --> 00:26:08,335
Before you go, there's somebody
here that I want you to meet.

579
00:26:08,402 --> 00:26:11,872
- All right? Don't go anywhere.
- O-Okay. [laughs]

580
00:26:13,174 --> 00:26:15,009
[Alex] Babe, I'm so happy
you made it.

581
00:26:15,076 --> 00:26:18,212
- [woman] Aw, thanks.
- We found a new family member we never knew.

582
00:26:18,312 --> 00:26:20,714
[woman] Sweetie, I don't want
to meet your family right now.

583
00:26:20,815 --> 00:26:23,518
- I haven't... I'm starving.
- [Alex] She's in the kitchen right now.

584
00:26:23,552 --> 00:26:28,889
[woman] I could eat an entire cow right now,
I could rip its face off, I am so hungry. Ugh!

585
00:26:28,989 --> 00:26:31,859
All right, here she is!

586
00:26:31,892 --> 00:26:34,995
- [Ellen] Oh, Megan, I'm so glad to see you!
- Oh.

587
00:26:35,029 --> 00:26:37,031
I'm Ellen, Alex's mom.

588
00:26:37,098 --> 00:26:38,666
I'm Mike, Alex's dad.

589
00:26:38,699 --> 00:26:41,669
This young man here, this is
Eric, his little brother.

590
00:26:41,702 --> 00:26:44,539
So, this is the fam. Oh!

591
00:26:44,573 --> 00:26:47,074
- [Olivia giggles]
- And this is Olivia,

592
00:26:47,174 --> 00:26:48,676
our long-lost relative.

593
00:26:48,709 --> 00:26:51,679
- Part of the fam.
- [Megan] Long-lost relative.

594
00:26:51,712 --> 00:26:55,049
- Um, it's so nice to meet you.
- [Olivia] Nice to meet <i>you.</i>

595
00:26:55,082 --> 00:26:58,018
[clicks tongue] - So,
Olivia is in the Peace Corps.

596
00:26:58,052 --> 00:26:59,720
She just recently came back
to the States.

597
00:26:59,753 --> 00:27:02,256
I'm sure she's got
a million stories to tell.

598
00:27:02,356 --> 00:27:03,791
Ehh.

599
00:27:03,891 --> 00:27:06,060
[Alex] Can't wait
to hear them all.

600
00:27:06,093 --> 00:27:08,095
I can't wait either. [giggles]

601
00:27:08,195 --> 00:27:09,564
So, you know what sounds
amazing?

602
00:27:09,598 --> 00:27:12,800
Like a little glass
of red Chardonnay?

603
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:15,136
Babe, it's 9:30.

604
00:27:16,437 --> 00:27:17,771
I'm kidding!

605
00:27:17,872 --> 00:27:19,907
[laughing]

606
00:27:19,974 --> 00:27:21,976
- But I am so hungry.
- That's so good.

607
00:27:22,076 --> 00:27:24,245
I mean, I have to eat
every 27 minutes.

608
00:27:24,311 --> 00:27:26,247
- Oh, yeah.
- It's the new diet that I have, so...

609
00:27:26,313 --> 00:27:28,382
Her metabolism is
lightning-fast.

610
00:27:28,415 --> 00:27:30,885
So nice meeting all of you,

611
00:27:30,918 --> 00:27:33,120
and you, see you later.

612
00:27:33,220 --> 00:27:35,656
- Bye!
- [family] Bye!

613
00:27:35,756 --> 00:27:37,258
[Olivia laughs nervously]

614
00:27:37,324 --> 00:27:38,325
Oh!

615
00:27:38,425 --> 00:27:40,227
It was such a short visit.

616
00:27:41,128 --> 00:27:42,897
Isn't she great?

617
00:27:42,930 --> 00:27:46,000
She is! She is!

618
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:47,268
Sweetie, oh.

619
00:27:47,301 --> 00:27:50,104
- She's great.
- [Eric] See ya.

620
00:27:52,106 --> 00:27:53,474
- [gasps]
- Olivia!

621
00:27:53,575 --> 00:27:55,442
[screams] Oh!

622
00:27:55,476 --> 00:27:57,444
Sorry, I thought I saw a spider.

623
00:27:57,512 --> 00:27:59,980
It was just... it was my keys.

624
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:02,950
Well, I-I just wanted to say

625
00:28:03,017 --> 00:28:05,186
that I know that you have
come a long way

626
00:28:05,286 --> 00:28:06,287
to be here with us,

627
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:08,155
and I'm just so glad.

628
00:28:08,222 --> 00:28:13,127
I'm so happy to have
a new member to our family.

629
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:15,597
- Oh.
- [sobbing loudly]

630
00:28:15,630 --> 00:28:17,798
Oh, goodness, okay.

631
00:28:17,831 --> 00:28:20,134
[Ellen bawling]

632
00:28:23,003 --> 00:28:24,338
[bawling stops]

633
00:28:24,438 --> 00:28:27,341
- [bawling resumes]
- O... kay.

634
00:28:29,343 --> 00:28:31,345
- Okay. Good, me too. Me too.
- Oh!

635
00:28:31,445 --> 00:28:34,348
Hon, we ought to invite her to the
engagement party at the River Bluff.

636
00:28:34,448 --> 00:28:36,116
The engagement party
at the River Bluff.

637
00:28:36,150 --> 00:28:37,519
Oh...

638
00:28:37,619 --> 00:28:40,888
I... I don't think
I could impose.

639
00:28:40,988 --> 00:28:42,456
- Oh!
- It'll be fine.

640
00:28:42,489 --> 00:28:46,493
Oh! I mean, the engagement
was a little... soon,

641
00:28:46,528 --> 00:28:48,896
but they're going to get
married in two weeks.

642
00:28:48,996 --> 00:28:50,798
- Can you believe it?
- Wow!

643
00:28:50,831 --> 00:28:53,234
[laughs] - That... that
is definitely sudden.

644
00:28:53,334 --> 00:28:58,305
Since Megan lives in Seattle, Alex has been
up there visiting her for a few months,

645
00:28:58,339 --> 00:29:00,508
and he finally proposed
last weekend.

646
00:29:00,575 --> 00:29:03,844
Won't you come to the engagement
party and help us celebrate?

647
00:29:03,911 --> 00:29:06,681
- [laughs nervously]
- Please!

648
00:29:06,747 --> 00:29:08,482
- Oh!
- Sure!

649
00:29:08,516 --> 00:29:11,318
Oh, yeah!

650
00:29:11,352 --> 00:29:13,187
Well, I... I guess
I'll see you guys then.

651
00:29:13,220 --> 00:29:15,923
- Okay. Bye, honey.
- I'd better go. Lots of unpacking.

652
00:29:16,023 --> 00:29:17,692
- Bye, Olivia.
- Bye.

653
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:21,895
[crying and laughing]

654
00:29:21,996 --> 00:29:25,199
Olivia! [crying]

655
00:29:25,232 --> 00:29:28,435
No, no!
You've got to be kidding me.

656
00:29:28,536 --> 00:29:31,272
She's totally wrong for him,
and he doesn't even see it,

657
00:29:31,372 --> 00:29:33,374
and his family
certainly doesn't see it.

658
00:29:33,407 --> 00:29:37,878
I mean, it's like she's got them
under some kind of spell.

659
00:29:37,911 --> 00:29:39,714
So, what are you going to do?

660
00:29:39,780 --> 00:29:42,517
[gasps] And what's going to happen
when the real Olivia shows up?

661
00:29:42,550 --> 00:29:45,620
I know, I don't know,
I mean, on one hand,

662
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:48,255
I can't keep pretending
to be someone I'm not,

663
00:29:48,322 --> 00:29:50,791
but on the other hand,
I can't just stand by

664
00:29:50,891 --> 00:29:55,095
and let Alex marry this...
witch of a woman.

665
00:29:55,195 --> 00:29:57,031
Mm. Hmm-hmm-hmm.

666
00:29:57,064 --> 00:29:59,534
W-Wait, okay, listen,
this is it.

667
00:29:59,567 --> 00:30:02,036
You're going to rescue him
from disaster.

668
00:30:02,069 --> 00:30:03,937
Once he sees that
you've saved him,

669
00:30:04,038 --> 00:30:06,974
he won't even care that you're
not the real Olivia, he'll thank you.

670
00:30:07,074 --> 00:30:09,443
Hmm, I don't know
about that one.

671
00:30:09,544 --> 00:30:11,546
You just got to learn
everything you can

672
00:30:11,579 --> 00:30:13,748
about the real Olivia Bailey.

673
00:30:13,814 --> 00:30:16,917
And then you don't
have to make anything up.

674
00:30:16,984 --> 00:30:20,220
Just spit straight facts. Done.

675
00:30:20,254 --> 00:30:21,922
Easy, problem solved.

676
00:30:21,955 --> 00:30:23,290
Hmm, nope.

677
00:30:23,390 --> 00:30:25,259
Never gonna happen.

678
00:30:27,094 --> 00:30:29,430
No, careful. Okay.

679
00:30:29,496 --> 00:30:31,165
I got it, I got it.

680
00:30:31,265 --> 00:30:33,768
- Oh, Ooh!
- [boxes clattering]

681
00:30:33,802 --> 00:30:35,570
Hey, whoa! What...?

682
00:30:35,603 --> 00:30:39,340
Hey, Olivia. Saw my life
flash before my eyes.

683
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:43,645
- [Olivia] Sorry, Toni.
- Uh... Hey, hold on and I'll help you.

684
00:30:47,081 --> 00:30:50,918
[Olivia whispering] Keys,
keys, oh, my God. Oh, my God.

685
00:30:52,086 --> 00:30:53,354
[groans]

686
00:30:53,454 --> 00:30:55,757
Hey, special delivery
from Toni, huh?

687
00:30:55,790 --> 00:30:57,792
- Okay, yeah, great, thanks.
- And going...

688
00:30:57,858 --> 00:31:00,628
Yeah, thank you, I really
appreciate it, but I'm good.

689
00:31:00,662 --> 00:31:02,797
Oh, no, I'm good
with these things.

690
00:31:02,831 --> 00:31:04,632
- Okay, now...
- Hey, let me get your keys.

691
00:31:04,666 --> 00:31:06,867
- O... kay.
- [groans] See what we got.

692
00:31:06,967 --> 00:31:08,469
No, nope, that's a phone.

693
00:31:08,536 --> 00:31:11,004
- Oh, yeah.
- Hmm... here we go.

694
00:31:11,105 --> 00:31:12,473
Ooh, hey. Oh, magic!

695
00:31:12,540 --> 00:31:14,375
- Oh!
- Abracadabra, there you go.

696
00:31:14,475 --> 00:31:16,611
Awesome. Thank you.
I'll take those. Okay.

697
00:31:16,644 --> 00:31:17,945
Yeah.

698
00:31:17,978 --> 00:31:21,115
So, uh, when are we gonna
go out like you promised?

699
00:31:21,148 --> 00:31:22,684
- Uh...
- Just got paid.

700
00:31:22,784 --> 00:31:24,485
I'll take you to someplace
really nice.

701
00:31:24,552 --> 00:31:26,153
Toni, Toni, listen.

702
00:31:26,186 --> 00:31:27,722
You're a great guy,

703
00:31:27,822 --> 00:31:31,826
and you're gonna make someone
really happy one day.

704
00:31:31,860 --> 00:31:33,862
It's just...
it's not gonna be me.

705
00:31:33,961 --> 00:31:35,663
And besides, you know,
I've already got

706
00:31:35,730 --> 00:31:37,965
two men in my life, so...
[clicks tongue]

707
00:31:37,998 --> 00:31:40,901
Oh, you talking about
your little furballs in there?

708
00:31:41,001 --> 00:31:42,970
They're puppies and I love them.

709
00:31:43,003 --> 00:31:45,807
Okay, well, what your puppies
got that I ain't got?

710
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:47,007
More fur.

711
00:31:47,074 --> 00:31:49,511
Hey, I've got fur!

712
00:31:49,544 --> 00:31:51,880
And I love to cuddle.

713
00:31:53,515 --> 00:31:56,350
Didn't go too bad.

714
00:31:56,417 --> 00:32:00,889
Hey, Mom, I'm gonna pick up some
boxes at the bottom of the stairs.

734
00:32:58,111 --> 00:32:59,814
You look, uh, different.

735
00:32:59,914 --> 00:33:01,315
Oh, man, that bad?

736
00:33:01,415 --> 00:33:05,219
No, no, I mean, not that you
didn't look beautiful before.

737
00:33:05,252 --> 00:33:08,455
Just having a hard time
believing we're actually related.

738
00:33:08,523 --> 00:33:11,593
[laughs] Yeah, uh, yes.
Yep, we are.

739
00:33:11,659 --> 00:33:13,260
- Yeah. Yeah?
- Mm-hmm, yep.

740
00:33:13,293 --> 00:33:15,897
- We're related. Mm-hmm.
- Yeah, okay.

741
00:33:15,930 --> 00:33:19,601
[Eric] And so there I was,
paintball gun in hand

742
00:33:19,634 --> 00:33:22,269
against four Marines.

743
00:33:22,302 --> 00:33:24,973
Ha! Weaklings.

744
00:33:25,072 --> 00:33:26,941
Didn't stand a chance.

[Mike] That's my boy! Hmm?
Tough as nails.

747
00:33:31,245 --> 00:33:33,113
Tough as nails.

748
00:33:33,146 --> 00:33:35,850
Eric, didn't you try to join the
Marines but couldn't pass the test?

749
00:33:35,950 --> 00:33:39,253
- [Eric wheezing]
- [Melissa] Mom, what is that?

750
00:33:39,286 --> 00:33:40,354
It's not true.

751
00:33:40,454 --> 00:33:42,122
I worked out.

752
00:33:42,155 --> 00:33:43,825
And trained.

753
00:33:43,925 --> 00:33:45,927
- With Marines.
- [Mike] Mm-hmm.

00:33:55,637 --> 00:33:57,839
[laughs] All right, here we go.

760
00:33:57,939 --> 00:34:00,173
So, um, Olivia...

761
00:34:00,274 --> 00:34:02,376
how was it in the Peace Corps?

762
00:34:02,476 --> 00:34:04,646
Yeah, I was in the Congo.

763
00:34:04,712 --> 00:34:08,016
Actually, African jungle.

764
00:34:08,115 --> 00:34:09,316
We would, uh,

765
00:34:09,349 --> 00:34:12,152
meet with the villagers,
and, um...

766
00:34:12,219 --> 00:34:15,023
"administer" food

767
00:34:15,155 --> 00:34:17,190
and, um...

768
00:34:17,291 --> 00:34:18,626
clothing, medicine.

769
00:34:18,660 --> 00:34:21,495
You know, just...
normal Peace Corps stuff.

770
00:34:21,529 --> 00:34:23,497
Nothing too exciting.

771
00:34:23,565 --> 00:34:26,000
[Ellen] Oh, how nice!

772
00:34:26,066 --> 00:34:28,201
How were the people?

773
00:34:28,302 --> 00:34:29,671
- So sweet!
- [Ellen] Sweet.

774
00:34:29,704 --> 00:34:34,207
So sweet, I mean, just... sweet.

775
00:34:34,308 --> 00:34:35,375
Sweet.

776
00:34:35,475 --> 00:34:37,311
- So, so sweet.
- [Megan] Really?

777
00:34:37,344 --> 00:34:40,648
I hear there's a lot of, like,
guerrilla warfare going on.

778
00:34:40,682 --> 00:34:43,718
Most of the gorillas and the other
animals kind of keep to themselves,

779
00:34:43,818 --> 00:34:45,687
you know, like in the zoo here.

780
00:34:45,720 --> 00:34:48,856
Just cute little fur babies.
[laughs]

781
00:34:48,890 --> 00:34:52,159
The jungle is
a pretty dangerous place.

782
00:34:52,192 --> 00:34:54,361
Were you ever afraid?

783
00:34:54,428 --> 00:34:57,565
You know, when you're with
the right person and people,

784
00:34:57,665 --> 00:35:00,568
fear just kind of slips away.

785
00:35:01,836 --> 00:35:04,872
Sometimes I felt
like I was home.

786
00:35:04,906 --> 00:35:06,541
Hmm.

787
00:35:06,608 --> 00:35:09,209
Ah, isn't that sweet, hon?

788
00:35:09,276 --> 00:35:11,445
- So sweet, yeah.
- Hon?

789
00:35:13,014 --> 00:35:17,284
You know, my dad
used to visit the Congo.

790
00:35:17,384 --> 00:35:20,622
So, where were you exactly?
I'm sure I've heard of it.

791
00:35:20,722 --> 00:35:24,124
Um, you know, it was a very,
very remote part.

792
00:35:24,224 --> 00:35:26,761
Uh, Cong... a... tirea.

793
00:35:26,861 --> 00:35:29,731
- Congatirea.
- Cong my diarrhea.

794
00:35:29,764 --> 00:35:32,066
Sounds like one mean
bowel movement, am I right?

795
00:35:32,132 --> 00:35:33,901
[Ellen] Eric,
we're at the dinner table.

796
00:35:33,935 --> 00:35:35,737
- [Alex sighs]
- You want a challenge?

797
00:35:35,803 --> 00:35:37,739
- No.
- I dare you to eat one of these bad boys.

798
00:35:37,772 --> 00:35:39,439
- No, I'm good. I'm good.
- Come on.

799
00:35:39,540 --> 00:35:40,742
- Boys!
- Come on, bro!

800
00:35:40,808 --> 00:35:42,409
I don't want
to ruin dinner, okay?

801
00:35:42,476 --> 00:35:45,379
- It's just a little ghost pepper.
- [sighs] Oh, man!

802
00:35:45,412 --> 00:35:48,549
So, Olivia, tell us more
about the Congo.

803
00:35:48,583 --> 00:35:51,284
I have so many
questions for you.

804
00:35:51,385 --> 00:35:52,587
Um, well...

805
00:35:52,620 --> 00:35:54,388
- Oh!
- S-Sorry.

806
00:35:54,421 --> 00:35:55,623
[diner] Oh!

807
00:35:55,723 --> 00:35:57,759
Uh, I wanna see it...

808
00:35:57,825 --> 00:36:00,227
I want to see you guys
eat the ghost pepper. [laughs]

809
00:36:00,260 --> 00:36:02,462
- [laughs] Game on.
- [Mike] All right, boys.

810
00:36:02,563 --> 00:36:04,065
May the best soldier win.

811
00:36:04,098 --> 00:36:06,768
Oh, Michael Steven,
don't encourage them!

812
00:36:06,834 --> 00:36:12,305
Name one thing
you're better at than me.

813
00:36:12,406 --> 00:36:13,975
One thing.

814
00:36:14,075 --> 00:36:15,475
Shut up, Eric.

815
00:36:15,576 --> 00:36:17,244
- Here we go.
- Here we go.

816
00:36:17,277 --> 00:36:19,847
- Yep.
- Rock-and-roll.

817
00:36:22,449 --> 00:36:23,951
Wait a minute.

818
00:36:25,019 --> 00:36:26,788
- Here it comes.
- [Ellen] Oh.

819
00:36:26,854 --> 00:36:27,922
Oh, God!

820
00:36:27,955 --> 00:36:31,025
Ha! What a wuss, look at him.

821
00:36:31,125 --> 00:36:32,760
- Do you need Mama's bread?
- Bread.

822
00:36:32,794 --> 00:36:35,129
Give me the bread,
give me the bread!

823
00:36:35,195 --> 00:36:37,865
I wanna see <i>you</i> do it,
you pansy!

824
00:36:37,965 --> 00:36:42,202

...can we have
a big glass of milk, please?

836
00:37:08,529 --> 00:37:10,230
Why did I do that?

837
00:37:10,330 --> 00:37:12,133
I knew you'd flake out.

838
00:37:12,166 --> 00:37:16,804
Excuse me. I'm going
to the ladies' room.

839
00:37:16,838 --> 00:37:18,371
- Oh, my gosh...
- 1%, 2%...

840
00:37:18,472 --> 00:37:20,641
You're burning up, I shouldn't
have had you do that.

841
00:37:20,675 --> 00:37:23,310
- I'm so sorry.
- Nah, that's okay.

00:38:12,392 --> 00:38:15,362
[Mike] Well, Eric is
taking it like a champ.

862
00:38:17,231 --> 00:38:18,733
[Ellen] Oh!

863
00:38:20,234 --> 00:38:22,904
Well, at least
the restrooms were clean.

864
00:38:23,938 --> 00:38:26,607
- [vomiting loudly]
- [Megan screams]

865
00:38:26,707 --> 00:38:28,709
[Eric coughing]

866
00:38:30,410 --> 00:38:32,312
[Megan gagging]

867
00:38:37,151 --> 00:38:38,886
<i>Semper fi.</i>

868
00:38:42,422 --> 00:38:44,158
Oh. Wow.

869
00:38:44,258 --> 00:38:47,762
Well, your face doesn't look
as swollen, so that's a positive.

870
00:38:47,795 --> 00:38:51,398
It's good, yeah, I'm doing a
little bit better, that's for sure.

871
00:38:51,431 --> 00:38:55,770
I mean, besides having one of the
most painful experiences of my life,

872
00:38:55,803 --> 00:38:58,338
and my life flashed
before my eyes.

873
00:38:58,438 --> 00:39:00,908
Ah, I'm so sorry.
I shouldn't have had you do it.

874
00:39:00,942 --> 00:39:04,312
It was my fault, bad choice.

875
00:39:04,411 --> 00:39:09,116
I'm actually really glad
you showed up when you did.

876
00:39:09,183 --> 00:39:10,518
Really? Why?

877
00:39:10,618 --> 00:39:15,122
Well, this whole family
heritage reuniting thing...

878
00:39:15,189 --> 00:39:17,992
When Grandpa Frank passed away,

879
00:39:18,092 --> 00:39:21,329
our family just fell
into this funk,

880
00:39:21,428 --> 00:39:23,130
and, I don't know.

881
00:39:23,197 --> 00:39:26,767
I think that's why I proposed
as soon as I did.

882
00:39:26,801 --> 00:39:31,672
You know, I wanted to... I wanted to give
everybody something to look forward to.

883
00:39:31,772 --> 00:39:33,841
But then you came along and...

884
00:39:33,941 --> 00:39:36,210
you gave us all hope again.

885
00:39:38,478 --> 00:39:40,648
Wow, I...

886
00:39:40,715 --> 00:39:42,617
Well, I love your family.

887
00:39:42,650 --> 00:39:44,819
I mean, and, to be honest,

888
00:39:44,852 --> 00:39:47,121
you guys have something
I've always wanted.

889
00:39:47,154 --> 00:39:49,223
You know, growing up
a lot of times,

890
00:39:49,323 --> 00:39:51,359
I just kind of felt
like I was alone.

891
00:39:51,458 --> 00:39:53,995
I've always wanted
what your family has.

892
00:39:54,061 --> 00:39:55,462
Well, you've found us.

893
00:39:55,495 --> 00:39:58,532
And now with Megan
entering the ranks,

894
00:39:58,633 --> 00:40:01,235
we'll be one big family.

895
00:40:01,335 --> 00:40:02,703
Yeah.

896
00:40:03,838 --> 00:40:06,540
So, that brings me
to my next question.

897
00:40:06,641 --> 00:40:07,675
[Alex] And that is?

898
00:40:07,708 --> 00:40:09,010
How do you know she's the one?

899
00:40:09,076 --> 00:40:11,078
Wow, you are just
getting right to it.

900
00:40:11,178 --> 00:40:16,851
Yeah. I mean, you said yourself you
rushed into asking her to marry you.

901
00:40:16,884 --> 00:40:20,855
- Yeah, I said that.
- So, what makes her the perfect fit for our family?

902
00:40:20,888 --> 00:40:23,658
That was so gross.

903
00:40:23,691 --> 00:40:25,326
Alex!

904
00:40:25,359 --> 00:40:28,029
Alex, let's go! Now!

905
00:40:28,095 --> 00:40:32,266
Yep, yep, just one sec.
Okay.

906
00:40:32,366 --> 00:40:34,835
- What are you doing tomorrow?
- I...

907
00:40:34,869 --> 00:40:37,872
Okay, so, Megan and I were
supposed to do some wedding stuff,

908
00:40:37,905 --> 00:40:40,041
but she has a couple
of business calls come up,

909
00:40:40,074 --> 00:40:43,544
so she can't go, and I could
really use the wedding help.

910
00:40:43,611 --> 00:40:46,547
Honestly, I'm not good
at planning, and, uh...

911
00:40:46,614 --> 00:40:49,550
a fresh female perspective
would be really good.

912
00:40:49,617 --> 00:40:53,955
And we're related now,
so your input would be huge.

913
00:40:54,055 --> 00:40:56,757
Alex, we are leaving!

914
00:40:56,857 --> 00:41:01,062
All right, hey, babe, yep.
We're... I'm coming. I'm coming.

915
00:41:01,128 --> 00:41:05,465
All right, so I'm going to pick you up
tomorrow at your friend's apartment.

916
00:41:05,566 --> 00:41:09,036
You just text me the address
and I'll be there.

917
00:41:11,439 --> 00:41:12,540
Okay.

918
00:41:14,775 --> 00:41:16,444
Oh, my God!

919
00:41:16,544 --> 00:41:18,579
What am I doing?

920
00:41:18,612 --> 00:41:19,981
God.

921
00:41:20,081 --> 00:41:21,749
[Alex] I'll see you tomorrow.

922
00:41:21,782 --> 00:41:25,052
I will see you tomorrow.

923
00:41:31,959 --> 00:41:34,095
[laughing softly]

924
00:41:38,498 --> 00:41:40,500
[mumbling]

925
00:41:42,436 --> 00:41:43,904
No.

926
00:41:50,945 --> 00:41:53,114
Olivia, it's Alex.

927
00:41:54,915 --> 00:41:56,617
Hey, Alex, hey!

928
00:41:56,650 --> 00:41:58,919
It's Olivia, can you hear me?

929
00:41:58,953 --> 00:42:01,856
What was that again?
I can't hear you. What?

930
00:42:01,956 --> 00:42:04,925
Alex, hey, hello!

931
00:42:04,959 --> 00:42:06,961
Yeah. [imitates static]
There's a lot of static.

932
00:42:06,994 --> 00:42:08,863
No, there's no static.

933
00:42:08,963 --> 00:42:10,965
<i>Breaker, breaker, Charlie.</i>

934
00:42:11,032 --> 00:42:13,300
Hello, testing, 1, 2, 3.
Is this thing on?

935
00:42:13,367 --> 00:42:15,169
<i>- Is it on? Is it working?</i>
- Alex?

936
00:42:15,269 --> 00:42:17,471
<i>Olivia? Hey, Olivia?</i>

937
00:42:17,538 --> 00:42:19,373
Can you hear me? Alex?

938
00:42:19,473 --> 00:42:22,943
<i>Uh, yes, I'd like one egg...</i>

939
00:42:22,977 --> 00:42:24,612
egg biscuit,

940
00:42:24,645 --> 00:42:27,314
bacon, couple hash browns.

941
00:42:27,348 --> 00:42:29,116
<i>One for you and one for me.</i>

942
00:42:29,150 --> 00:42:31,285
Okay, you're clearly a dork.

943
00:42:31,318 --> 00:42:34,655
[Spanish accent] Olivia,
it is me, the great Don Juan.

944
00:42:34,722 --> 00:42:36,991
<i>Are you ready
to be whisked away?</i>

945
00:42:37,058 --> 00:42:39,326
Hello, Mr. Don Juan.

946
00:42:39,393 --> 00:42:42,696
To what do I owe
this enchanting visit?

947
00:42:42,797 --> 00:42:46,333
Are you ready to be whisked away
on a romantic adventure?

948
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:48,335
[Olivia] <i>Oh, should I wear</i>

949
00:42:48,402 --> 00:42:51,972
my fanciest corset and tunic,
or... a blouse and jeans?

950
00:42:52,006 --> 00:42:55,743
[normal voice] The early bird gets the perfect
wedding venue, so, uh... [clicks tongue]

951
00:42:55,843 --> 00:42:56,911
chop-chop.

952
00:42:57,011 --> 00:42:58,579
I'll see you in two seconds.

953
00:42:58,679 --> 00:43:00,214
Dork.

954
00:43:01,048 --> 00:43:03,317
[peaceful music playing]

955
00:43:07,421 --> 00:43:09,023
So, um...

956
00:43:09,056 --> 00:43:12,326
how did you and, uh, Megan meet?

957
00:43:12,359 --> 00:43:14,428
I was at a conference in Seattle

958
00:43:14,529 --> 00:43:16,864
and her and I actually
bumped into each other

959
00:43:16,931 --> 00:43:18,899
at a coffee shop of all places.

960
00:43:18,999 --> 00:43:20,201
- Really?
- Yeah.

961
00:43:20,267 --> 00:43:22,036
- A coffee shop?
- Yeah. Yeah.

962
00:43:22,069 --> 00:43:24,605
It's cliché, I know, but...

963
00:43:24,705 --> 00:43:29,276
Well, all the cafés I go to,
uh, none of the guys notice me.

964
00:43:29,376 --> 00:43:30,878
Okay, I...

965
00:43:30,911 --> 00:43:32,713
I find that really hard
to believe.

966
00:43:32,780 --> 00:43:34,549
Well, believe it.

967
00:43:34,583 --> 00:43:37,218
If I saw you at a café,
I would walk right up to you,

968
00:43:37,284 --> 00:43:38,352
I'd introduce myself.

969
00:43:38,385 --> 00:43:40,788
- Hmm.
- Yeah, totally.

970
00:43:40,888 --> 00:43:42,123
Actually, you know what,

971
00:43:42,223 --> 00:43:44,425
there's a really
great place downtown...

972
00:43:44,526 --> 00:43:45,893
Macasca Coffee.

973
00:43:45,926 --> 00:43:48,262
I think you would meet
someone really great there.

974
00:43:48,362 --> 00:43:51,600
Yeah. You know,
I should do that.

975
00:43:51,699 --> 00:43:54,603
Yeah, yeah.
You should, actually.

976
00:43:54,702 --> 00:43:57,071
It's got really good lattes.

977
00:43:57,138 --> 00:43:59,574
[suspenseful music playing]

978
00:44:03,477 --> 00:44:04,546
Shoot!

979
00:44:04,579 --> 00:44:05,713
- Um...
- What?

980
00:44:05,746 --> 00:44:07,481
Uh, come here. Come here.

981
00:44:07,582 --> 00:44:10,951
Okay, I-I need you
to do me a favor, okay?

982
00:44:11,051 --> 00:44:12,720
All right, well,
what do you need me to do?

983
00:44:12,753 --> 00:44:14,388
- Pretend to be my boyfriend.
- [Toni] Hey!

984
00:44:14,421 --> 00:44:16,724
- All right. What?
- Please, just be my boyfriend.

985
00:44:16,757 --> 00:44:19,160
- Just for a minute, just for a second, okay?
- Yeah.

986
00:44:19,260 --> 00:44:20,928
[Toni] Hey, yo!

987
00:44:20,995 --> 00:44:22,796
Yo, Livs!

988
00:44:22,897 --> 00:44:25,132
Hey!

989
00:44:26,133 --> 00:44:28,736
Is this guy bothering you?

990
00:44:29,803 --> 00:44:30,971
Uh, no.

991
00:44:31,071 --> 00:44:33,440
Toni, actually,
this is my, uh...

992
00:44:34,643 --> 00:44:36,443
boyfriend, Alex.

993
00:44:36,511 --> 00:44:39,013
- [Alex] Yep.
- Boyfriend?

994
00:44:39,113 --> 00:44:40,848
- [Olivia] Yep.
- What about us?

995
00:44:40,948 --> 00:44:43,652
Toni, there never was an "us,"

996
00:44:43,751 --> 00:44:44,952
and there never will be.

997
00:44:45,019 --> 00:44:46,287
All right.

998
00:44:47,855 --> 00:44:49,591
Toni with an "I."

999
00:44:49,624 --> 00:44:53,260
Alex with an "x." Mm!
[clicks tongue]

1000
00:44:53,294 --> 00:44:56,263
- Ain't that the truth?
- Okay.

1001
00:44:56,297 --> 00:44:58,533
Boyfriend, huh?

1002
00:44:58,633 --> 00:45:00,034
Yeah, mm-hmm.

1003
00:45:00,134 --> 00:45:02,870
That weren't the vibes you were
giving me the other night.

1004
00:45:02,970 --> 00:45:04,438
There were no "vibes."

1005
00:45:04,471 --> 00:45:06,140
None, zero.

1006
00:45:06,173 --> 00:45:08,108
Zero vibes, okay?

1007
00:45:08,142 --> 00:45:09,310
Whatever.

1008
00:45:09,376 --> 00:45:10,811
All right, come on, Waffles.

1009
00:45:10,878 --> 00:45:13,214
We'll see you back
at the apartment, all right?

1010
00:45:13,314 --> 00:45:15,115
I got more vibes for you.

1011
00:45:15,149 --> 00:45:20,555
[Alex chuckles] - Oh, hey, Liv,
when you're done with your boyfriend,

1012
00:45:20,655 --> 00:45:22,189
come see your manfriend.

1013
00:45:22,289 --> 00:45:24,792
You know where I live. 102.

1014
00:45:24,825 --> 00:45:26,393
[clicks tongue] Come on, girl.

1015
00:45:30,197 --> 00:45:32,833
Yo, Tina! Nice!

1016
00:45:32,900 --> 00:45:36,504
- Okay, Toni with an "I," I have to know.
- Look, I can explain everything.

1017
00:45:36,571 --> 00:45:39,306
He lives in my friend's apartment
and he thinks he's in love

1018
00:45:39,340 --> 00:45:41,041
with every single woman
he meets.

1019
00:45:41,141 --> 00:45:44,211
- Every single one.
- Oh, yeah, sure, sure. Whatever you say.

1020
00:45:44,311 --> 00:45:46,380
- Jerk.
- Ow!

1021
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:48,717
Hey, is that any way
to treat your new boyfriend?

1022
00:45:48,816 --> 00:45:50,384
Come on!

Good morning, Oscar.

1037
00:46:39,366 --> 00:46:41,135
I made cookies.

1038
00:46:41,235 --> 00:46:42,570
I don't know if you noticed,

1039
00:46:42,604 --> 00:46:44,773
but I'm not supposed to eat
that stuff,

1040
00:46:44,872 --> 00:46:47,308

1041
00:46:47,408 --> 00:46:49,376
[whispering] I won't tell.

1042
00:46:54,415 --> 00:46:57,552
Parents, make sure that
you're checking the spelling

1043
00:46:57,585 --> 00:46:59,587
on each of those
family trees, okay?

1044
00:46:59,654 --> 00:47:02,956
- [sighs]
- Kira, how's it going?

1045
00:47:03,023 --> 00:47:07,796

family tree scribbled in crayon...

1046
00:47:07,895 --> 00:47:09,263
[whispering] ...I'll scream.

1047
00:47:09,330 --> 00:47:10,598
Listen, I feel your pain.

1048
00:47:10,665 --> 00:47:12,801
Last week,
I had double the numbers,

1049
00:47:12,900 --> 00:47:15,936
and I had two twins that I swear
were out to murder me.

1050
00:47:16,003 --> 00:47:20,007
[scoffs] I bet they're not as bad
as those little devils over there.

1051
00:47:20,107 --> 00:47:21,776
Oh, they look kind of cute.

1052
00:47:21,842 --> 00:47:23,812
- [Kira] Hmm-mm-mm.
- [Olivia] No? Okay.

1053
00:47:23,911 --> 00:47:26,681
So, do you want to teach
my next family tree class?

1054
00:47:26,781 --> 00:47:28,516
- [clicks tongue]
- Girl, you're good...

1055
00:47:28,616 --> 00:47:30,184
[whispering]
...but not that good.

1056
00:47:30,284 --> 00:47:31,952

[Mike] Becca,
stop rushing her, she's old.

1074
00:48:42,189 --> 00:48:44,224
When I get my strength back,

1075
00:48:44,324 --> 00:48:47,428
I will be shoving you two
off the steps.

00:48:47,529 --> 00:48:50,063
- Yes, you will.
- Yes, you will, Mom.

00:48:50,164 --> 00:48:51,699
Come on.

1078
00:48:51,733 --> 00:48:53,367
[Alex] Pretty incredible, right?

1079
00:48:53,400 --> 00:48:55,870
[Olivia]
I have seen pictures, but...

1080
00:48:55,936 --> 00:48:57,204
they don't do it justice.

1081
00:48:57,237 --> 00:48:59,039
[sighs] Wait till you see
the inside.

1082
00:48:59,106 --> 00:49:00,909
[laughs]

1083
00:49:02,342 --> 00:49:03,545
- [sighs]
- Wow!

1084
00:49:03,578 --> 00:49:04,779
Yep.

1085
00:49:04,879 --> 00:49:06,581
So Nana and Grandpa Frank
lived here,

1086
00:49:06,681 --> 00:49:09,717
up until a couple of years ago,
when he passed away.

1087
00:49:09,784 --> 00:49:12,386
That's when Nana
moved in with my parents.

1088
00:49:12,419 --> 00:49:15,222
Wow! This is amazing.

1089
00:49:15,289 --> 00:49:16,591
Yeah.

1090
00:49:16,658 --> 00:49:20,194
Oh! And this
is the perfect setting.

1091
00:49:20,227 --> 00:49:21,863
For what?

1092
00:49:21,896 --> 00:49:23,263
You'll see.

1093
00:49:25,767 --> 00:49:27,968
The Bailey family lineage
can be traced back

1094
00:49:28,068 --> 00:49:30,905
as far as the Anglo-Saxons
in Europe.

1095
00:49:30,939 --> 00:49:34,408
They were known as the people
who loved to journey and explore.

1096
00:49:34,475 --> 00:49:36,276
It's in your blood.

1097
00:49:36,376 --> 00:49:38,078
<i>Our</i> blood.

1098
00:49:38,111 --> 00:49:40,548
Yes. Our blood.

1099
00:49:40,582 --> 00:49:43,984
Oh! This so exciting! [laughs]

1100
00:49:44,084 --> 00:49:47,622
Your family heritage chest
is filled with many cool items,

1101
00:49:47,722 --> 00:49:51,258
such as historical documents,
artefacts

1102
00:49:51,325 --> 00:49:53,393
and many interesting photos.

1103
00:49:53,427 --> 00:49:55,996
Well, we should have done this
a long time ago.

1104
00:49:56,096 --> 00:49:58,065
Yeah, this is really neat.

1105
00:49:58,098 --> 00:50:02,069
I do have one more
surprise for you guys.

1106
00:50:02,102 --> 00:50:04,506
In this jar is some earth

1107
00:50:04,606 --> 00:50:08,442
from the region of
the Anglo-Saxons in Europe.

1108
00:50:08,475 --> 00:50:11,478
It's like history
you can touch and feel.

1109
00:50:14,448 --> 00:50:17,585
[sniffling] Oh.

1110
00:50:17,619 --> 00:50:20,120
[sneezes twice]

1111
00:50:20,153 --> 00:50:21,689
- Oh.
- Oh.

1112
00:50:22,524 --> 00:50:23,858
Whoo! [laughs]

1113
00:50:23,958 --> 00:50:26,093
It almost feels like
you're really there.

1114
00:50:26,126 --> 00:50:27,862
Amazing, right?

1115
00:50:33,300 --> 00:50:35,803
Old and disgusting.

1116
00:50:35,837 --> 00:50:37,005
Hmm.

1117
00:50:38,806 --> 00:50:42,476
Hey, Megan.
Isn't this place amazing?

1118
00:50:46,814 --> 00:50:47,815
Hey.

1119
00:50:47,882 --> 00:50:49,684
Good. You got here
just in time.

1120
00:50:49,784 --> 00:50:51,986
We're about to take a tour.

1121
00:50:52,020 --> 00:50:53,855
Oh.

1122
00:50:53,955 --> 00:50:55,122
Great.

1123
00:50:58,325 --> 00:50:59,561
What the heck!

1124
00:50:59,661 --> 00:51:02,030
What is all over my face?!

1125
00:51:02,129 --> 00:51:06,233
Oh, Alex, I can just see you

1126
00:51:06,333 --> 00:51:10,370
and Megan and all the children

1127
00:51:10,470 --> 00:51:12,707
having dinner right here
at this table.

1128
00:51:12,807 --> 00:51:14,709
She's as sweet as a button.

1129
00:51:14,809 --> 00:51:18,546
[sighs] Our kids are gonna love
this place, right, honey?

1130
00:51:18,646 --> 00:51:21,015
- Yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

1131
00:51:21,081 --> 00:51:22,884
Oh.

1132
00:51:22,984 --> 00:51:24,819
[gasps] Mm.

1133
00:51:26,854 --> 00:51:28,155
[sighs]

1134
00:51:30,190 --> 00:51:32,359
So, what did I miss?

1135
00:51:32,426 --> 00:51:36,363
Megan and I were just talking about how we
wouldn't change a thing about this place.

1136
00:51:36,396 --> 00:51:37,732
Right, hon?

1137
00:51:37,832 --> 00:51:39,701
It hasn't changed much
since I was a kid.

1138
00:51:39,767 --> 00:51:44,371
And the thought of having our
own kids run around this place is...

1139
00:51:44,438 --> 00:51:46,340
Magical.

1140
00:51:46,373 --> 00:51:48,042
Exactly.

1141
00:51:48,076 --> 00:51:49,343
You know what, sweetie?

1142
00:51:49,376 --> 00:51:51,579
I absolutely love this place.

1143
00:51:51,679 --> 00:51:54,048
It is perfect for us.

1144
00:51:54,114 --> 00:51:55,415
Yeah, babe, all right.

1145
00:51:55,516 --> 00:51:56,884
Yeah, it's very, uh...

<i>...Harry Potter's Hogwarts,</i>

1148
00:52:00,722 --> 00:52:02,724
Ha! Yes! That's exactly it.

1149
00:52:02,790 --> 00:52:04,859
I was trying to think of
what it all reminded me of,

1150
00:52:04,892 --> 00:52:06,561
and, <i>pfft,</i> picture perfect.

1151
00:52:06,628 --> 00:52:09,229
Yes, that's what it
reminds me of.

1152
00:52:09,296 --> 00:52:10,397
So funny.

1153
00:52:10,430 --> 00:52:13,233
[laughing hysterically]

1154
00:52:13,266 --> 00:52:16,403
You, you're so funny,
and she's so funny.

1155
00:52:16,436 --> 00:52:18,305
- You're such a jokester.
- I try.

1156
00:52:18,405 --> 00:52:21,743
Think about all the jokes we'll
be telling each other in this house

1157
00:52:21,809 --> 00:52:23,477
once we're married.

1158
00:52:31,085 --> 00:52:34,454
Alex, this woodwork
reminds me of the craftmanship

1159
00:52:34,555 --> 00:52:37,692
that your ancestors did
back in Europe, all the detail.

1160
00:52:37,792 --> 00:52:40,293
Yeah, our relatives were
Freemasons and carpenters.

1161
00:52:40,394 --> 00:52:43,598
Babe, didn't you tell me that
your family helped build this house?

1162
00:52:43,665 --> 00:52:46,934
I can definitely tell
in the woodwork.

1163
00:52:47,001 --> 00:52:49,236
No, no, we never worked
on our own homes.

1164
00:52:49,269 --> 00:52:51,939
We always hired
that thing out, silly.

1165
00:52:52,006 --> 00:52:53,440
- This room.
- That one?

1166
00:52:53,508 --> 00:52:54,809
[Alex] Yeah.

1167
00:52:56,944 --> 00:52:59,514
You know, I remember reading
about your ancestors

1168
00:52:59,614 --> 00:53:01,181
and how they had a lumberyard

1169
00:53:01,281 --> 00:53:04,418
and they would sell wood
to the pioneers going west.

1170
00:53:04,451 --> 00:53:07,421
They did. That is how
my family made their wealth

1171
00:53:07,454 --> 00:53:09,090
in the late 1800s.

1172
00:53:09,123 --> 00:53:11,458
- Hmm.
- Sweetie, I bet your family members

1173
00:53:11,491 --> 00:53:15,630
were those ones in, like,
the fancy big dresses and hats

1174
00:53:15,697 --> 00:53:17,799
in, you know,
the old-timey photos, right?

1175
00:53:17,865 --> 00:53:20,835
No, babe, my family
was extremely humble,

1176
00:53:20,935 --> 00:53:24,138
and they never flaunted
their wealth around like that.

1177
00:53:24,204 --> 00:53:25,807
Oh.

1178
00:53:27,608 --> 00:53:28,976
You!

1179
00:53:34,649 --> 00:53:37,151
[Megan] I know what
you're up to.

1180
00:53:37,185 --> 00:53:40,988
- What?
- You're trying to come between me and Alex.

1181
00:53:41,022 --> 00:53:43,390
I can read you like a book.

1182
00:53:43,490 --> 00:53:46,794
[scoffs] Why would I
not want you to be with Alex?

1183
00:53:46,828 --> 00:53:48,361
You guys are great together.

1184
00:53:48,462 --> 00:53:50,565
It's so obvious.

1185
00:53:50,665 --> 00:53:52,667
You have a little
school girl crush on him,

1186
00:53:52,734 --> 00:53:53,901
and it's pathetic.

1187
00:53:54,001 --> 00:53:56,571
[scoffs] Alex is my relative.

1188
00:53:56,671 --> 00:53:58,005
- Your "relative"?
- Yeah.

1189
00:53:58,072 --> 00:54:03,343
He's my very, very
distant cousin.

1190
00:54:03,410 --> 00:54:04,679
Twice removed.

1191
00:54:04,746 --> 00:54:07,247
I'm not buying it.

1192
00:54:07,347 --> 00:54:09,483
You're hiding something.

1193
00:54:09,517 --> 00:54:13,221
I don't know what it is,
but I'm going to figure it out.

1194
00:54:15,923 --> 00:54:17,390
[coughs]

1195
00:54:17,424 --> 00:54:19,861
This place is filthy, I hate it!

1196
00:54:21,328 --> 00:54:22,930
[Tim] You haven't told them yet?

1197
00:54:23,030 --> 00:54:25,032
[Olivia] Shh! Oscar doesn't
know yet either.

1198
00:54:25,099 --> 00:54:27,835
I don't know what to do. I
just... can you please help me?

1199
00:54:27,869 --> 00:54:29,269
I need some advice.

1200
00:54:29,369 --> 00:54:31,371
Can I have your clients
when you get fired?

1201
00:54:31,438 --> 00:54:34,274
You're not helping.
That doesn't help me at all.

1202
00:54:34,374 --> 00:54:36,544
[cart rolling]

1203
00:54:36,611 --> 00:54:39,781
Tim, great job
on the Bailey family.

1204
00:54:39,881 --> 00:54:41,883
They really loved
their heritage chest.

1205
00:54:41,916 --> 00:54:46,721
Yeah, everything seems
to be in perfect... order.

1206
00:54:46,788 --> 00:54:49,223
[Oscar] You know what's strange?

1207
00:54:49,289 --> 00:54:51,692
I just got
an email from Olivia Bailey

1208
00:54:51,726 --> 00:54:56,063
saying that her military stay
was extended two more weeks.

1209
00:54:56,130 --> 00:55:00,735
Now, would somebody please
tell me how Olivia Bailey

1210
00:55:00,768 --> 00:55:03,403
can be in two places at once?

1211
00:55:03,470 --> 00:55:05,405
It's my fault, Oscar.

1212
00:55:05,472 --> 00:55:06,908
I...

1213
00:55:06,941 --> 00:55:09,110
They think I'm Olivia Bailey.

1214
00:55:09,210 --> 00:55:11,913
- What?
- I got stuck in Kansas City,

1215
00:55:11,946 --> 00:55:14,048
and I had Olivia deliver
the chest to their house.

1216
00:55:14,081 --> 00:55:15,883
And I swear that's
exactly what I was doing.

1217
00:55:15,917 --> 00:55:17,718
I was delivering
the heritage chest

1218
00:55:17,752 --> 00:55:19,587
and now they think
that I'm Olivia.

1219
00:55:19,620 --> 00:55:21,155
- [Oscar] You <i>are</i> Olivia.
- Exactly.

1220
00:55:21,255 --> 00:55:23,658
But I fell or passed out
or something and, I don't know,

1221
00:55:23,758 --> 00:55:27,228
I woke up in their house the next day and
now I'm in love with Alex and his family...

1222
00:55:27,261 --> 00:55:29,496
- Whoa! Who's Alex?
- [sighs] He's one of the sons.

1223
00:55:29,597 --> 00:55:31,833
And he's getting married in
two weeks, and I have to stop him

1224
00:55:31,933 --> 00:55:35,236
because she's totally wrong for him
and she's just going to take his house,

1225
00:55:35,269 --> 00:55:37,404
and it's incredible because
I've always wanted a family,

1226
00:55:37,437 --> 00:55:40,775
but it's also terrible and
complicated and it's a lie because...

1227
00:55:40,842 --> 00:55:45,646
[Oscar, chuckling] Uh, Tim,
could you give us a minute, please?

1228
00:55:45,746 --> 00:55:47,615
Oh, yeah.

1229
00:55:47,648 --> 00:55:50,284
Yeah, sure, yeah,
you got it, yeah.

1230
00:55:50,318 --> 00:55:52,987
- [clears throat]
- [Olivia] I'm sorry, Oscar.

1231
00:55:54,789 --> 00:55:57,258
I don't know what to do.

1232
00:55:57,291 --> 00:55:59,861
[Oscar] You can start
by telling the truth.

1233
00:55:59,961 --> 00:56:04,832
Secondly, breaking up somebody's
wedding is not your call.

1234
00:56:04,932 --> 00:56:08,169
She's horrible for him, and I literally
heard her say she's gonna leave him

1235
00:56:08,269 --> 00:56:10,271
after they sell their house,
and he doesn't...

1236
00:56:10,304 --> 00:56:12,773
I mean, he doesn't
even like her, really.

1237
00:56:12,807 --> 00:56:14,709
[chuckles]
So, why is he marrying her?

1238
00:56:14,809 --> 00:56:16,277
I don't know, but what happens

1239
00:56:16,310 --> 00:56:19,046
when the family loses
their family mansion?

1240
00:56:19,146 --> 00:56:22,016
What happens when they find out
you're not Olivia Bailey?

1241
00:56:22,116 --> 00:56:23,317
[groans]

1242
00:56:23,351 --> 00:56:26,621
You're right.
You're always right.

1243
00:56:26,654 --> 00:56:30,157
You know, just annoyingly,
you're just so right, right.

1244
00:56:32,360 --> 00:56:35,162
Olivia, wait.

1245
00:56:35,229 --> 00:56:39,133
Now, I know that you've
always wanted a family.

1246
00:56:39,166 --> 00:56:42,169
They may seem like
the perfect match,

1247
00:56:42,236 --> 00:56:47,508
but the best family
is one that's open and honest.

1248
00:56:47,541 --> 00:56:49,343
You've always got me.

1249
00:56:50,711 --> 00:56:52,246
Thanks, Oscar.

1250
00:57:00,487 --> 00:57:03,357
- [Alex] And is Paul McCartney still alive...
- [Olivia] You know...

1251
00:57:03,423 --> 00:57:06,861
[Alex] ...or did he die in a car
wreck on November 9, 1966?

1252
00:57:06,928 --> 00:57:10,264
So legend has it people
have actually had

1253
00:57:10,364 --> 00:57:13,000
near-death experiences
inside this cupcake shop.

1254
00:57:13,034 --> 00:57:14,535
Hmm. Pretty lofty.

1255
00:57:14,602 --> 00:57:18,172
Yeah. The sugary sweetness
could take you down.

1256
00:57:18,205 --> 00:57:19,907
- Are you ready?
- I was born ready.

1257
00:57:20,007 --> 00:57:21,909
- You were born ready?
- I love sugar.

1258
00:57:22,009 --> 00:57:27,682
Well, honey, prepare yourself
for something sinfully delightful.

1259
00:57:27,715 --> 00:57:29,183
[laughs]

1260
00:57:33,721 --> 00:57:35,756
- [clerk] Here's your card. Thanks.
- Thank you.

1261
00:57:35,856 --> 00:57:39,894
Thank you so much, and I've got
a little treat for you.

1262
00:57:39,927 --> 00:57:42,930
Wow! A whole quarter.

1263
00:57:43,030 --> 00:57:44,732
Don't spend it all in one place.

1264
00:57:44,799 --> 00:57:46,968
Don't worry, I won't.

1265
00:57:47,068 --> 00:57:48,468
[couple laughing]

1266
00:57:48,569 --> 00:57:49,804
- Mm.
- Wow!

1267
00:57:49,904 --> 00:57:52,239
So you really want cupcakes

1268
00:57:52,306 --> 00:57:54,075
instead of a traditional
wedding cake?

1269
00:57:54,108 --> 00:57:55,910
- Oh, yeah, totally.
- Hmm.

1270
00:57:58,446 --> 00:57:59,914
Gosh.

1271
00:58:01,048 --> 00:58:02,883
You're just so easy to talk to

1272
00:58:02,917 --> 00:58:04,585
and hang out with.

1273
00:58:04,618 --> 00:58:05,786
How do you do it?

1274
00:58:05,886 --> 00:58:07,254
What?

1275
00:58:07,288 --> 00:58:09,824
Well, you know,
take someone who's

1276
00:58:09,924 --> 00:58:11,759
so sure of something one minute

1277
00:58:11,792 --> 00:58:16,063
and then make them completely
second guess themselves the next.

1278
00:58:25,773 --> 00:58:27,241
Alex...

1279
00:58:29,176 --> 00:58:31,278
There's something
I've got to tell you.

1280
00:58:31,312 --> 00:58:35,516
Um, I'm not who you think I am,

1281
00:58:35,616 --> 00:58:37,318
and...

1282
00:58:38,786 --> 00:58:40,855
my past is just really
complicated,

1283
00:58:40,955 --> 00:58:44,258
and I wanted to tell you
the minute I met you,

1284
00:58:44,291 --> 00:58:45,993
but then I met
your awesome family

1285
00:58:46,093 --> 00:58:47,862
and they were so loving,
and I just...

1286
00:58:47,962 --> 00:58:49,463
Just stop.

1287
00:58:49,497 --> 00:58:50,931
Stop right there.

1288
00:58:50,965 --> 00:58:53,467
Let me tell you something,
all right?

1289
00:58:53,534 --> 00:58:57,304
Whatever you've been through,
whatever's happened,

1290
00:58:58,839 --> 00:59:00,775
okay, you're family now.

1291
00:59:00,808 --> 00:59:03,177
Forever.

1292
00:59:07,314 --> 00:59:09,283
- Uh... Oh, gosh, um...
- What's wrong?

1293
00:59:09,316 --> 00:59:10,651
[laughs]

1294
00:59:10,718 --> 00:59:14,188
Hey, guys, I love this place.

1295
00:59:14,288 --> 00:59:17,191
It is so cute. [laughs]

1296
00:59:17,291 --> 00:59:19,727
Right? Megan, what happened
to your conference call?

1297
00:59:19,827 --> 00:59:23,330
I was like, "Listen,
I'm getting married soon."

1298
00:59:23,397 --> 00:59:27,001
I have so much planning to do
and it's a Saturday

1299
00:59:27,034 --> 00:59:29,236
and I missed you.

1300
00:59:29,336 --> 00:59:32,673
[laughs] So, what are you guys
doing, what you got here?

1301
00:59:32,740 --> 00:59:36,644
Well, we're just, you know,
sampling some cupcakes here.

1302
00:59:39,246 --> 00:59:40,481
Mmm...

1303
00:59:40,515 --> 00:59:41,682
Hmm. Mm-hmm.

1304
00:59:41,715 --> 00:59:43,851
That's good.

1305
00:59:43,918 --> 00:59:45,586
Yep, um...

1306
00:59:45,686 --> 00:59:48,989
Babe, I've got this appointment
at another wedding cake shop

1307
00:59:49,023 --> 00:59:50,424
that's a few miles away.

1308
00:59:50,525 --> 00:59:52,561
I mean, their reviews
are to die for.

1309
00:59:52,660 --> 00:59:55,062
So we really need to leave now
if we're gonna make it on time.

1310
00:59:55,162 --> 00:59:57,198
All right, yep, okay, all right.

1311
00:59:57,264 --> 01:00:01,168
So, you can come with us, Olivia, if
you want to ride in the back or something.

1312
01:00:01,202 --> 01:00:04,573
- It's really not a problem. You should totally come with us.
- Oh, no, no, gosh.

1313
01:00:04,672 --> 01:00:07,241
This is your guys's time. I
don't want to spoil anything and...

1314
01:00:07,341 --> 01:00:09,578
That's okay, Olivia,
I totally understand. [laughs]

1315
01:00:09,677 --> 01:00:12,046
All right.
Okay, uh, we gotta get goin'.

1316
01:00:12,079 --> 01:00:15,216
So, we need to go because the
car's running and we need to go.

1317
01:00:15,282 --> 01:00:17,586
- Come on, sweetie.
- Okay, all right.

1318
01:00:17,685 --> 01:00:18,752
- See ya!
- Bye!

1319
01:00:18,853 --> 01:00:20,921
- [Olivia] Bye!
- [Alex] Oh.

1320
01:00:32,700 --> 01:00:34,068
Come back and see us.

1321
01:00:34,135 --> 01:00:36,538
- Thank you.
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1322
01:00:37,972 --> 01:00:42,143
Hey... so.

1323
01:00:42,243 --> 01:00:44,411
Have you told him yet?

1324
01:00:45,946 --> 01:00:48,782
- [Olivia sighs]
- That complicated?

1325
01:00:48,883 --> 01:00:50,918
I really care about him, Oscar.

1326
01:00:50,985 --> 01:00:53,320
And he's so funny
and he's smart,

1327
01:00:53,420 --> 01:00:56,423
and he loves history
as much as I do.

1328
01:00:56,490 --> 01:00:59,561
I just don't want
to lose him, you know?

1329
01:00:59,594 --> 01:01:01,428
Isn't he getting married?

1330
01:01:01,462 --> 01:01:03,998
Yes, in two days.

1331
01:01:04,098 --> 01:01:05,266
Hmm.

1332
01:01:05,332 --> 01:01:07,334
It's your birthday!

1333
01:01:07,434 --> 01:01:10,171
Oscar, please,
please, don't remind me.

1334
01:01:10,271 --> 01:01:13,642
But I got you cupcakes!
Ta-da!

1335
01:01:19,780 --> 01:01:21,348
What am I going to do?

1336
01:01:21,448 --> 01:01:26,287
I'm 30 and completely alone.

1337
01:01:26,320 --> 01:01:28,789
Come on, come on, sit down.

1338
01:01:34,795 --> 01:01:36,263
Do you know how many years

1339
01:01:36,297 --> 01:01:40,434
I've been working
at the Noyes Home for Children?

1340
01:01:40,467 --> 01:01:41,435
Thirty.

1341
01:01:41,468 --> 01:01:43,771
[clicks tongue]
Same age as you.

1342
01:01:45,139 --> 01:01:47,808
I remember when
they brought you in...

1343
01:01:47,841 --> 01:01:52,514
[laughs] <i>I had trained</i>
<i>for months as a volunteer.</i>

1344
01:01:52,614 --> 01:01:57,384
<i>I wasn't prepared
when they brought me you.</i>

1345
01:01:57,484 --> 01:02:01,322
<i>I had hoped
that some wonderful family</i>

1346
01:02:01,355 --> 01:02:03,791
would come and adopt you.

1347
01:02:03,824 --> 01:02:07,394
You know, I prayed
for that every day.

1348
01:02:08,796 --> 01:02:11,165
You've always been there, Oscar.

1349
01:02:11,198 --> 01:02:12,667
Got you a job.

1350
01:02:12,701 --> 01:02:15,035
[laughs] Yep. That too.

1351
01:02:15,135 --> 01:02:16,971
And here.

1352
01:02:17,004 --> 01:02:18,806
Red velvet.

1353
01:02:18,839 --> 01:02:21,509
Happy birthday, Olivia.

1354
01:02:22,711 --> 01:02:23,844
Thank you.

1355
01:02:28,882 --> 01:02:31,686
Mm. I'm not sharing.

1356
01:02:31,752 --> 01:02:34,154
[laughs] Oh!

1357
01:02:48,570 --> 01:02:49,837
[sighs]

1358
01:02:51,539 --> 01:02:53,941
- Sofi.
- We're gonna go, right now.

1359
01:02:54,041 --> 01:02:56,110
Sofi, what's wrong?

1360
01:02:56,210 --> 01:02:57,712
I'll explain on the way.

1361
01:02:57,746 --> 01:03:00,114
Are you okay?

1362
01:03:02,283 --> 01:03:03,784
Sofi, what are we doing here?

1363
01:03:03,884 --> 01:03:06,420
I told you, there's a problem
with the heritage chest.

1364
01:03:06,521 --> 01:03:07,722
What?

1365
01:03:07,788 --> 01:03:10,224
Surprise!

1366
01:03:10,291 --> 01:03:12,359
[cheering]

1367
01:03:12,393 --> 01:03:16,196
[lively music playing]

1368
01:03:16,230 --> 01:03:17,965
Don't you pass out again!

1369
01:03:18,065 --> 01:03:20,735
[laughter]

1370
01:03:24,271 --> 01:03:26,708
Sofi said it was your big 3-0.

1371
01:03:26,741 --> 01:03:29,943
We had to do something, honey.
You're part of the family now!

1372
01:03:30,044 --> 01:03:31,746
Hey, happy birthday, kiddo.

1373
01:03:33,414 --> 01:03:35,449
You guys, this is amazing,
really.

1374
01:03:35,550 --> 01:03:37,318
Perfect!

1375
01:03:38,586 --> 01:03:40,655
We're getting cake, right?

1376
01:03:40,755 --> 01:03:42,590
Zip it. Yeah.

1377
01:03:42,657 --> 01:03:44,224
Come on.

1378
01:03:44,258 --> 01:03:47,461
[Olivia] Hey, hey, Tim.
Is Oscar here?

1379
01:03:47,562 --> 01:03:51,965
He... should... be... here.

1380
01:03:52,066 --> 01:03:54,501
- I'll call him again.
- Okay.

1381
01:03:56,571 --> 01:03:59,641
Yeah, just like that, perfect.
Thanks, Mom, appreciate it.

1382
01:04:01,475 --> 01:04:03,812
Hey, Alex, um,
can I talk to you?

1383
01:04:03,911 --> 01:04:05,279
Were you surprised?

1384
01:04:05,346 --> 01:04:07,414
Yes, I was surprised, but, um...

1385
01:04:07,448 --> 01:04:10,117
I really need to talk to you,
in private.

1386
01:04:10,184 --> 01:04:12,587
Sure, sure, sure, okay. Just
hold that thought, all right?

1387
01:04:12,620 --> 01:04:15,255
- Please, I need to talk to you.
- Birthday girl!

1388
01:04:15,289 --> 01:04:17,291
Hey, just one... Alex!

1389
01:04:17,324 --> 01:04:19,126
<i>- All right, I just...</i>
- Oh, I got it.

1390
01:04:19,159 --> 01:04:22,096
- No, no, no.
- [indistinct chatter]

1391
01:04:22,129 --> 01:04:23,798
<i>So, right, testing, testing.</i>

1392
01:04:23,832 --> 01:04:27,434
<i>Okay, if I could get
everybody's attention up here.</i>

1393
01:04:27,468 --> 01:04:29,804
<i>I just want to say, first off,</i>

1394
01:04:29,838 --> 01:04:34,308
<i>the last couple of weeks
have been incredible.</i>

1395
01:04:34,341 --> 01:04:37,512
<i>All right?</i>

1396
01:04:37,612 --> 01:04:40,849
<i>Olivia, when you
reached out to Mom</i>

1397
01:04:40,948 --> 01:04:43,518
<i>and you told her you
were part of the family,</i>

1398
01:04:43,618 --> 01:04:46,153
<i>we... we were anxious.</i>

1399
01:04:46,220 --> 01:04:48,489
<i>What's it gonna be like?</i>

1400
01:04:48,523 --> 01:04:51,358
[sighs] <i>But then you showed up,</i>

1401
01:04:51,458 --> 01:04:53,828
<i>and we got to get to know you,</i>

1402
01:04:53,862 --> 01:04:55,830
<i>and I personally, I have to say,</i>

1403
01:04:55,896 --> 01:04:58,533
<i>I... I'm so glad
that you were brave</i>

1404
01:04:58,633 --> 01:05:00,668
<i>and that you were bold</i>

1405
01:05:00,735 --> 01:05:04,539
<i>and you forgave
all of our weirdness.</i>

1406
01:05:06,039 --> 01:05:08,810
[clicks tongue] <i>You brought</i>
<i>our family together,</i>

1407
01:05:08,843 --> 01:05:11,912
<i>and I...
I thank you for that.</i>

1408
01:05:12,012 --> 01:05:16,016
<i>Everyone, raise your glasses up.</i>

1409
01:05:16,049 --> 01:05:18,986
<i>This one's for you, Olivia.
Happy birthday.</i>

[cheering]

1411
01:05:24,091 --> 01:05:26,927
<i>Ooh, Olivia, my dear.</i>

1412
01:05:27,027 --> 01:05:29,664
<i>I'm so happy to have you.</i>

1413
01:05:29,697 --> 01:05:33,535
<i>You have truly opened
our eyes to our past.</i>

1414
01:05:33,601 --> 01:05:37,004
<i>And-and now to our future.</i>

1415
01:05:37,037 --> 01:05:39,774
<i>Thank you.</i>

1416
01:05:39,874 --> 01:05:40,775
<i>Thank you.</i>

<i>Olivia.</i> [clears throat]

1422

<i>to call you whatever it is
you are to us.</i>

1423
01:06:07,034 --> 01:06:11,773
<i>You are kind.</i>

1424
01:06:11,873 --> 01:06:15,710
<i>And for this family, I just hope</i>

1425
01:06:15,743 --> 01:06:19,213
<i>you aren't having
secret fantasies</i>

1426

am I right?</i>

1428
01:06:25,085 --> 01:06:26,754
<i>- Am I right?</i>
- Come on.

1429
01:06:26,821 --> 01:06:29,089
[Alex] <i>All right,</i>
<i>we've had a great night.</i>

1430
01:06:29,156 --> 01:06:30,625
<i>That is it for speeches.</i>

1431
01:06:30,725 --> 01:06:32,961
<i>Now it's time to get some food.</i>

1432
01:06:33,060 --> 01:06:34,929
<i>Who's ready to eat?</i>

1433
01:06:34,963 --> 01:06:37,397
Wait! Wait, wait.

1436
01:06:41,603 --> 01:06:43,070
Hey, hey, babe.

1437
01:06:43,103 --> 01:06:45,272
I thought you said
you weren't coming.

1438
01:06:45,339 --> 01:06:47,341
And miss this opportunity?

1439
01:06:47,441 --> 01:06:48,943
I just have a few words.
Do you mind?

1440
01:06:49,009 --> 01:06:51,445
Oh, yeah, go for it.
There you go.

1441
01:06:53,413 --> 01:06:55,249
<i>Hi, everyone.</i>

1442
01:06:55,282 --> 01:06:57,417
<i>This is such a great night,</i>

1443
01:06:57,451 --> 01:06:59,654
<i>family and friends
gathering together</i>

1444
01:06:59,754 --> 01:07:04,959
<i>to celebrate
a very special person.</i>

1445
01:07:06,628 --> 01:07:10,798
<i>I have a big surprise
for the birthday girl.</i>

1446
01:07:13,100 --> 01:07:16,303
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

1447
01:07:16,370 --> 01:07:18,640
<i>the real Olivia Bailey.</i>

[dramatic music playing]

1449
01:07:27,214 --> 01:07:30,818
<i>This is the Olivia Bailey
who is in the Peace Corps.</i>

1450
01:07:30,885 --> 01:07:33,988
<i>She is 32, not turning 30,</i>

1451
01:07:34,022 --> 01:07:38,392
<i>and she was the one that Ellen
invited to come to St. Jo.</i>

1452
01:07:44,064 --> 01:07:45,332
Please.

1453
01:07:45,399 --> 01:07:48,335
[Olivia Bailey clears throat]

1454
01:07:48,368 --> 01:07:50,004
<i>Hello, everyone.</i>

1455
01:07:50,038 --> 01:07:54,042
<i>I'm not sure what's
happening yet,</i>

1456
01:07:54,141 --> 01:07:56,343
<i>but I'm Olivia Bailey.</i>

1457
01:07:56,410 --> 01:07:58,078
<i>Um, I apologize for the delay.</i>

1458
01:07:58,178 --> 01:08:00,080
<i>My stay in the Congo
was extended,</i>

1459
01:08:00,180 --> 01:08:05,152
<i>and the communication was bad,
but, uh, I'm here now.</i>

1460
01:08:06,754 --> 01:08:08,656
Okay.

1461
01:08:09,757 --> 01:08:11,491
<i>So this is the Olivia Bailey</i>

1462
01:08:11,526 --> 01:08:14,494
<i>who was supposed to pick up
the Bailey heritage chest</i>

1463
01:08:14,529 --> 01:08:17,164
<i>and deliver it to your home,</i>

1464
01:08:17,197 --> 01:08:20,068
<i>but instead, that Olivia...</i>

1465
01:08:20,167 --> 01:08:23,605
<i>if that's even your real name...</i>

1466
01:08:23,705 --> 01:08:26,507
<i>jumped into her place.</i>

1467
01:08:26,541 --> 01:08:28,876
<i>Did I miss anything?</i>

1468
01:08:28,943 --> 01:08:32,046
[softly] Megan, is this
some kind of sick joke?

1469
01:08:32,112 --> 01:08:34,682
<i>Tell us, Olivia.</i>

1470
01:08:34,716 --> 01:08:36,918
<i>Who are you?</i>

1471
01:08:37,018 --> 01:08:38,720
<i>Really.</i>

1472
01:08:41,254 --> 01:08:42,857
She's right.

1473
01:08:44,892 --> 01:08:47,294
[sighs] My name
is Olivia Anderson,

1474
01:08:47,394 --> 01:08:48,963
not Olivia Bailey.

1475
01:08:51,532 --> 01:08:53,067
I work at Homemade Heritage,

1476
01:08:53,101 --> 01:08:55,202
and I would have never
met any of you

1477
01:08:55,235 --> 01:08:57,437
if it wasn't
for a change in schedules.

1478
01:08:57,538 --> 01:09:00,908
You lied to us all this time?

1479
01:09:00,942 --> 01:09:03,878
[Olivia] The more I spent time
with you all and got to know you,

1480
01:09:03,911 --> 01:09:06,246
the harder it became
to tell you the truth, and...

1481
01:09:06,313 --> 01:09:09,449
you all are the closest thing
I've ever had to family,

1482
01:09:09,550 --> 01:09:13,554
of mom and a dad and...

1483
01:09:13,588 --> 01:09:16,090
grandparents and brothers
and sisters.

1484
01:09:17,491 --> 01:09:19,794
I'm really sorry.

1485
01:09:23,463 --> 01:09:25,232
Olivia Bailey...

1486
01:09:26,834 --> 01:09:28,301
you're really lucky

1487
01:09:28,402 --> 01:09:31,773
to have all these wonderful
people in your life.

1488
01:09:35,308 --> 01:09:39,113
And I'm really sorry
I pretended to be you.

1489
01:09:41,115 --> 01:09:42,517
Olivia.

1490
01:09:44,351 --> 01:09:45,987
It's Oscar.

1491
01:09:46,087 --> 01:09:48,923
He's in the hospital.
I...

1492
01:09:48,956 --> 01:09:50,290
What?

1493
01:09:52,359 --> 01:09:55,029
I don't know what happened,
but I'm going.

1494
01:09:56,130 --> 01:09:57,632
I'm going.

1495
01:10:00,467 --> 01:10:01,769
I'm sorry.

new beginnings?</i>

<i>Anyone?</i>

1499
01:10:19,520 --> 01:10:20,822
<i>No?</i>

Oscar?

1503
01:11:12,272 --> 01:11:15,209
Um... I told the Baileys.

1504
01:11:18,513 --> 01:11:21,348
They know everything, and it...

1505
01:11:21,381 --> 01:11:23,217
didn't go well.

1506
01:11:27,722 --> 01:11:31,592
And, um, I believe you.

1507
01:11:31,692 --> 01:11:34,394
I-I-I believe that...

1508
01:11:34,461 --> 01:11:37,031
you prayed for me every day,

1509
01:11:37,064 --> 01:11:40,400
that I'd find a family, but...

1510
01:11:40,467 --> 01:11:42,069
I realized that...

1511
01:11:42,103 --> 01:11:43,905
[sniffles]

1512
01:11:43,971 --> 01:11:46,974
...that God gave me you.

1513

You're my family.

1514
01:11:51,746 --> 01:11:56,083
I don't know who my mom
or my dad is.

1515

But you've always been there.

1516

Thank you.

Oscar?

1519
01:12:22,677 --> 01:12:24,745
Can you hear me?

1520
01:12:26,647 --> 01:12:28,783
No. No.

1521

Please, don't leave me.

1545
01:16:57,952 --> 01:17:00,087
I'm glad we're not related.

1546
01:17:00,187 --> 01:17:03,390
Because it's gonna make
what I have to say

1547
01:17:03,457 --> 01:17:04,959
complicated.

1548
01:17:06,961 --> 01:17:09,230
What are you doing here?

1549
01:17:11,866 --> 01:17:13,400
I miss you.

1550
01:17:16,904 --> 01:17:18,205
[Olivia] Why?

1551
01:17:18,239 --> 01:17:20,975
It's crazy, I know.

1552
01:17:24,111 --> 01:17:26,046
I'm in love with you.

1553
01:17:28,082 --> 01:17:30,117
There it is. I said it.

1554
01:17:32,052 --> 01:17:33,988
I've been falling in love
with you

1555
01:17:34,088 --> 01:17:36,390
from the very first night
we met.

1556
01:17:38,659 --> 01:17:42,763
And all I do is think about
getting to spend time with you.

1557
01:17:45,933 --> 01:17:47,768
You must not feel the same way.

1558
01:17:49,670 --> 01:17:52,139
You're just standing there,
so...

1559
01:17:57,344 --> 01:17:59,446
I'll just... I'm gonna go.

1560

[peaceful symphonic music

1561
01:18:12,793 --> 01:18:15,029
I have a confession to make.

1562
01:18:16,964 --> 01:18:18,132
We <i>are</i> related?

1563
01:18:18,199 --> 01:18:20,635
[laughs] No.

1564
01:18:22,303 --> 01:18:24,639
I only like chocolate
with caramel.

1565
01:18:33,948 --> 01:18:35,684
I'm so glad this worked out.

1566

[laughs]

1567
01:18:43,290 --> 01:18:44,792
Okay, um...

1568
01:18:46,695 --> 01:18:49,830
there is one more thing
you need to know.

1569
01:18:49,863 --> 01:18:51,365
Okay.

1570
01:18:51,465 --> 01:18:53,668
Will you ride with me?

1571
01:18:53,702 --> 01:18:55,502
Where are we going?

1572
01:18:55,570 --> 01:18:57,304
You'll find out.

1573
01:19:19,960 --> 01:19:21,563
It's good.

1574
01:19:22,930 --> 01:19:24,331
Trust me.

1575
01:19:34,008 --> 01:19:36,377
Olivia, thank you for coming.

1576
01:19:36,443 --> 01:19:38,513
Um, would you mind
taking a seat?

1577
01:19:45,219 --> 01:19:47,921
Olivia, first we need
to let you know that

1578
01:19:48,022 --> 01:19:49,524
we are not mad at you.

1579
01:19:49,557 --> 01:19:52,893
In fact, we are so happy
to have gotten to know you.

1580
01:19:52,960 --> 01:19:58,065
Eh... you're not the Olivia, though,
we thought we knew. [laughs]

1581
01:19:58,098 --> 01:20:00,234
I'm really sorry about that.

1582
01:20:00,267 --> 01:20:01,869
It's okay.

1583
01:20:01,902 --> 01:20:04,706
We just want to get to know
the real Olivia.

1584
01:20:04,739 --> 01:20:06,741
And you were right,

1585
01:20:06,807 --> 01:20:09,109
after getting to spend
some time here,

1586
01:20:09,209 --> 01:20:12,313
I'm really lucky to have these
wonderful people in my life.

1587
01:20:12,413 --> 01:20:16,250
We know why it was
hard for you, dearie.

1588
01:20:16,283 --> 01:20:20,254
You've been alone
for a long time.

1589
01:20:20,287 --> 01:20:22,757
We have something
we want to give you.

1590
01:20:24,224 --> 01:20:27,461
We had a delivery at our house
the day after your birthday.

1591
01:20:27,529 --> 01:20:31,465
We were a little confused,
so we opened it.

1592
01:20:37,971 --> 01:20:42,176
- [man] Delivery. Sign here, please.
- All rightie.

1593
01:20:44,345 --> 01:20:45,446
There you go.

[mystical music playing]

1595
01:20:47,114 --> 01:20:48,750
Have a good one.

1596
01:20:48,783 --> 01:20:51,085
Thanks, have a good one.

1597
01:20:51,118 --> 01:20:53,187
Hey, El, did you
order something?

1598
01:20:53,287 --> 01:20:54,455
[Ellen] Not me.

1599
01:20:54,522 --> 01:20:56,924
- What did you do?
- What is it?

1600
01:20:58,526 --> 01:21:02,196
Oh, my God,
is that a heritage box?

1601
01:21:03,197 --> 01:21:04,532
[Ellen gasps]

1602
01:21:09,804 --> 01:21:13,140
We were a little confused,
so we opened it.

1603
01:21:13,173 --> 01:21:17,512
Olivia, it's from Oscar.

1604
01:21:17,612 --> 01:21:21,048
For some reason,
he mailed it to us.

1605
01:21:21,148 --> 01:21:24,318
Oh... B-But before
you open it,

1606
01:21:24,385 --> 01:21:26,353
you need to read this...
this letter.

1607
01:21:26,453 --> 01:21:28,222
It came with it.

1608
01:21:45,005 --> 01:21:48,843
[Oscar] <i>"Olivia, I am writing</i>
<i>you this letter</i>
