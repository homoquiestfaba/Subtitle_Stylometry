00:11:06,233 --> 00:11:08,702
So pissed I have to drive
all the way to Amityville

170
00:11:08,736 --> 00:11:10,137
for this stupid ticket!

171
00:11:10,171 --> 00:11:11,906
[grunts]

172
00:11:12,507 --> 00:11:14,241
This is dumb.

173
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:28,989
Hey, wait a minute,
don't spend all day on that, Malloy.

174
00:11:29,023 --> 00:11:30,791
Still need that closet cleared.

175
00:11:30,824 --> 00:11:32,393
What closet?

176
00:11:32,426 --> 00:11:33,827
Downstairs in the morgue.

177
00:11:33,861 --> 00:11:36,430
Doc's been going apeshit
with his lack of space.

178
00:11:36,463 --> 00:11:39,133
He does realize that we're
merging with Central, right?

179
00:11:42,504 --> 00:11:43,737
[doctor] You ready for this?

180
00:11:44,772 --> 00:11:45,873
I don't know.

181
00:11:45,906 --> 00:11:48,242
I've never done this before.

182
00:11:50,444 --> 00:11:51,712
I don't know.

183
00:11:52,514 --> 00:11:53,948
[gasps]

184
00:11:57,151 --> 00:12:00,421
[crying]
That's my little girl.

185
00:12:03,791 --> 00:12:05,793
We're gonna find the guys
who did this.

186
00:12:08,362 --> 00:12:11,332
We-we can't let her mother
see her like this.

187
00:12:14,235 --> 00:12:17,004
[crying]

188
00:12:17,037 --> 00:12:19,907
There's just some paperwork in the
office that you have to fill out.

189
00:12:24,812 --> 00:12:27,014
I-I gotta go. I can't stay.

190
00:12:27,047 --> 00:12:28,882
I gotta go open the bar.

191
00:12:35,923 --> 00:12:37,258
[Howie] Dammit, Mae.

192
00:12:37,291 --> 00:12:39,893
Always forgets
to toast my buns.

193
00:12:39,927 --> 00:12:41,563
I bet she'd love
to toast your buns.

194
00:12:41,596 --> 00:12:44,932
Hey, hey, Dashy, be a mensch,
throw me my sandwich over here.

195
00:12:46,267 --> 00:12:48,269
- Yeah.
- Better hurry up and eat that

196
00:12:48,302 --> 00:12:49,370
before the lieutenant grabs it.

197
00:12:49,403 --> 00:12:51,105
Oh, you got jokes today too.

198
00:12:51,138 --> 00:12:52,973
Okay, I got one.

199
00:12:53,007 --> 00:12:55,109
- Knock, knock.
- Who's there?

200
00:12:55,142 --> 00:12:57,344
- You're wife.
- Ex-wife.

201
00:12:57,378 --> 00:12:59,413
She called a few times.

202
00:12:59,446 --> 00:13:02,049
Hey, you guys notice
the radios on the fritz?

203
00:13:02,082 --> 00:13:05,386
Yes, I noticed.
Been like that all frickin' morning.

204
00:13:05,419 --> 00:13:08,188
Hm, maybe it has something
to do with that acid rain.

205
00:13:11,458 --> 00:13:13,193
Dash, don't take too long
with that, please.

206
00:13:13,227 --> 00:13:14,461
I need you back at the front.

207
00:13:14,495 --> 00:13:16,397
Flannery called out again.

208
00:13:16,430 --> 00:13:21,368
All these damn department cuts,
so short-staffed.

209
00:13:21,402 --> 00:13:23,837
Well, just...
Look, we get too busy we call Massapequa.

210
00:13:23,871 --> 00:13:26,608
Man, screw Massapequa.

211
00:13:26,641 --> 00:13:29,276
They always feel like
we owe them something.

212
00:13:29,310 --> 00:13:31,078
Oh, and your wife
really did call.

213
00:13:31,111 --> 00:13:33,013
Sounded important, you should
probably call her back.

214
00:13:33,047 --> 00:13:34,982
Ex-wife. Alright.

215
00:13:38,653 --> 00:13:41,322
- Oh...
- Hey, you blind?

216
00:13:41,355 --> 00:13:44,458
What's a matter with you?
Six feet.

217
00:13:44,491 --> 00:13:47,094
Live it. Learn it.

218
00:13:47,127 --> 00:13:48,596
Ma'am, I'm sorry.
I didn't see you.

219
00:13:48,630 --> 00:13:53,167
Obviously.
You're making me claustrophobic.

220
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:56,470
Where can I go
to pay a ticket?

221
00:13:56,504 --> 00:13:59,340
Sure, the office at
the front desk can assist you.

222
00:13:59,373 --> 00:14:00,240
You can't?

223
00:14:00,274 --> 00:14:02,209
Ma'am, the office
at the front desk...

224
00:14:02,242 --> 00:14:04,178
You don't have to get
pissed about it.

225
00:14:04,211 --> 00:14:05,647
What's wrong with people?

226
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:08,248
Ma'am, I'm just trying
to answer your question.

227
00:14:08,282 --> 00:14:10,217
You need to stop
what you're doing

228
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:13,287
and assist a person
who needs help.

229
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:17,458
Serve and protect!
Right?

230
00:14:18,158 --> 00:14:20,027
So, serve!

231
00:14:20,695 --> 00:14:22,162
Unbelievable.

232
00:14:22,196 --> 00:14:23,598
Ma'am, maybe you should
go to Central

233
00:14:23,631 --> 00:14:26,066
to get that taken care of.
Our hub is in transition and...

234
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:28,235
Never mind!

235
00:14:28,268 --> 00:14:33,207
Talking to you
is like talking to the wall!

236
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:40,080
Seriously?

237
00:14:48,288 --> 00:14:49,356
Mm...

238
00:14:50,725 --> 00:14:52,393
Hello, ma'am.

239
00:14:52,426 --> 00:14:54,228
Can I help you?

240
00:14:54,261 --> 00:14:56,163
We will see.

241
00:14:56,196 --> 00:15:01,168
I want to talk to someone
about paying this damn ticket.

242
00:15:01,201 --> 00:15:05,305
Great, well, our cashier
isn't in right now.

243
00:15:05,339 --> 00:15:07,307
She'll be in at nine.

244
00:15:07,341 --> 00:15:09,042
And she'll be happy
to help you then.

245
00:15:09,076 --> 00:15:12,547
Of course! You'll be glad
to take my damn money.

246
00:15:12,580 --> 00:15:14,314
I beg your pardon?

247
00:15:14,348 --> 00:15:17,484
I need to get
back to the city.

248
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:23,123
I have to wait
until someone comes later?

249
00:15:23,157 --> 00:15:26,360
You're here. I'm here.

250
00:15:26,393 --> 00:15:28,362
Can't you do it?

251
00:15:28,395 --> 00:15:30,197
As I said, ma'am, I'm sorry.

252
00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:31,965
I have to watch the front desk.

253
00:15:31,999 --> 00:15:34,001
Now our front desk liaison
will be in...

254
00:15:34,034 --> 00:15:36,671
What else can you people
do to annoy me?

255
00:15:36,704 --> 00:15:42,009
What are you doing right now?
Just watching TV and stuffing your face?

256
00:15:42,042 --> 00:15:45,513
I hope you get diabetes.

257
00:15:45,547 --> 00:15:49,684
It's just around the corner
from high blood pressure.

258
00:15:49,717 --> 00:15:50,819
Yeah, I know.

259
00:15:50,852 --> 00:15:54,455
It's right around the corner
from You're Being Rude Lane

260
00:15:54,488 --> 00:15:56,624
and Take a Seat Boulevard.

261
00:15:56,658 --> 00:15:58,192
[scoffs]

262
00:16:03,063 --> 00:16:04,331
[laughs]

263
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:08,168
Drop your weapon! Police!

264
00:16:08,202 --> 00:16:09,470
Don't do it!

265
00:16:09,504 --> 00:16:11,639
I said don't do it!

266
00:16:11,673 --> 00:16:13,207
Drop it!

267
00:16:23,183 --> 00:16:25,419
[chuckles]

268
00:16:25,452 --> 00:16:28,155
- That's how you do it.
- Nice shooting, Rossi.

269
00:16:28,188 --> 00:16:29,323
Sergeant you scared me.

270
00:16:29,356 --> 00:16:30,357
I scared you?

271
00:16:30,390 --> 00:16:32,560
Your shooting scares me.

272
00:16:32,594 --> 00:16:35,563
[sniffs] Oh, my...
Oh, that smells so good.

273
00:16:35,597 --> 00:16:37,732
Mae sends her
very famous sandwich.

274
00:16:37,765 --> 00:16:41,703
One soy bacon, tofu,
scrambled nutritional yeast,

275
00:16:41,736 --> 00:16:44,137
with soy cheese
on gluten free toast for you.

276
00:16:44,171 --> 00:16:47,174
Yes, she made it special
just for me, that's so cool.

277
00:16:47,207 --> 00:16:49,476
There are a lot of words that come into
my head when I think of that sandwich.

278
00:16:49,511 --> 00:16:51,445
Cool? Yeah, definitely
wasn't one of them.

279
00:16:51,478 --> 00:16:53,280
Oh, Sergeant,
I wanted to ask you:

280
00:16:53,313 --> 00:16:55,215
Did you sign off on my leave?
I wanna make sure

281
00:16:55,249 --> 00:16:57,150
I have everything in order
before I head out.

282
00:16:57,184 --> 00:16:58,285
When did you
plan on taking it?

283
00:16:58,318 --> 00:16:59,687
Monday. My parent's anniversary

284
00:16:59,721 --> 00:17:01,689
is next Friday
down in Chapel Hill.

285
00:17:01,723 --> 00:17:03,390
Yes, yes I did.
It's in your inbox.

286
00:17:03,423 --> 00:17:05,392
- Okay, thank you.
- Yes, and remember to tell front desk

287
00:17:05,425 --> 00:17:07,094
so you can block out your time.
Okay?

288
00:17:07,127 --> 00:17:09,664
Okay. It means the world to me
to get to go.

289
00:17:09,697 --> 00:17:11,733
And there's so much to do.
I mean, I still gotta get down there,

290
00:17:11,766 --> 00:17:14,167
gotta meet up with my family.
I've gotta get fitted, get a dress...

291
00:17:14,201 --> 00:17:15,837
Okay. Great, is there
anything else you need from me?

292
00:17:15,870 --> 00:17:18,071
- Nope. No.
- Alright. Okay.

293
00:17:18,105 --> 00:17:20,107
Oh, and Rossi,
when you're firing a gun,

294
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:21,475
you don't need
to go "blam, blam."

295
00:17:21,509 --> 00:17:23,745
The gun does
the talking for you.

296
00:17:23,778 --> 00:17:26,280
Yeah, you saw that.
Yes, sir.

297
00:17:47,602 --> 00:17:49,102
Oh, hey, Dashy.

298
00:17:49,136 --> 00:17:50,270
Morning, Doc.

299
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:55,275
Alright, thanks.

300
00:17:55,309 --> 00:17:56,878
Is this the dead dancer?

301
00:17:56,911 --> 00:17:59,747
Uh, no, she's between the two...

302
00:17:59,781 --> 00:18:02,282
No, actually this is
the dead dancer, you were right.

303
00:18:02,316 --> 00:18:04,251
I heard McQueen caught
the bastard that did her in.

304
00:18:04,284 --> 00:18:05,887
- Yeah.
- Look, he did her pretty good, huh?.

305
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:09,156
- I don't know.
- Looks crowded in here today.

306
00:18:09,189 --> 00:18:11,659
Oh, yeah.
I got two on gurneys,

307
00:18:11,693 --> 00:18:14,629
four in the hallway,
four in the freezer.

308
00:18:14,662 --> 00:18:16,263
I had to send
six back to county.

309
00:18:16,296 --> 00:18:17,397
You should send
most of them to county

310
00:18:17,431 --> 00:18:18,833
so we can start breaking this
place down for the merge.

311
00:18:18,866 --> 00:18:20,868
That merge is gonna suck.

312
00:18:20,902 --> 00:18:22,604
Yeah, tell me about it.

313
00:18:24,171 --> 00:18:25,540
- [grunts]
- Do you want a napkin?

314
00:18:25,573 --> 00:18:27,742
- I got plenty.
- No, I'm alright.

315
00:18:27,775 --> 00:18:30,578
That... that can't be sanitary.

316
00:18:31,813 --> 00:18:34,515
- What?
- Never mind.

317
00:18:34,549 --> 00:18:36,517
McQueen's on his way back
with Gallo.

318
00:18:36,551 --> 00:18:38,720
I'd really like that report today
so we can slam dunk this guy.

319
00:18:38,753 --> 00:18:40,521
Oh, absolutely, man,
absolutely.

320
00:18:40,555 --> 00:18:43,223
Oh, by the way,
the air conditioner,

321
00:18:43,256 --> 00:18:44,525
uh, did you order the new one?

322
00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:46,259
Did you fix that closet door?

323
00:18:46,293 --> 00:18:47,795
Oh, you know, the closet...

324
00:18:47,829 --> 00:18:49,697
That door, it won't close

325
00:18:49,731 --> 00:18:51,032
'cause it's swelling
because of the heat.

326
00:18:51,065 --> 00:18:54,401
- Come again? The heat?
- Uh, yeah, you know, that's what happens.

327
00:18:54,434 --> 00:18:56,771
The door swells 'cause of the
heat and you can't close it.

328
00:18:56,804 --> 00:18:59,807
Okay. The bathroom's out of order.
What's up with that?

329
00:18:59,841 --> 00:19:02,844
Uh, I don't know.
Some sorta shit.

330
00:19:02,877 --> 00:19:05,245
- Yeah, backed up?
- Yeah, backed up.

331
00:19:05,278 --> 00:19:06,514
[both chuckle]

332
00:19:06,547 --> 00:19:07,949
Alright, I'll have Malloy
take a look at it

333
00:19:07,982 --> 00:19:09,349
when he comes down
for the closet.

334
00:19:09,383 --> 00:19:12,319
- Thanks.
- Ira, please.

335
00:19:12,887 --> 00:19:14,354
Jesus!

336
00:19:14,388 --> 00:19:15,790
Not you, too.

337
00:19:15,823 --> 00:19:19,493
Uh, rigor mortis set in.
Hits the nerve. You're fine.

338
00:19:19,527 --> 00:19:20,862
Believe me, she's dead.

339
00:19:20,895 --> 00:19:22,730
She ain't coming back to life.

340
00:19:22,764 --> 00:19:25,900
[Dash] So, uh, where's Skeeter?
I got his PB&J.

341
00:19:25,933 --> 00:19:27,669
Yo, Childs.

342
00:19:27,702 --> 00:19:31,238
Uh, he doesn't like to be
called Skeeter anymore.

343
00:19:31,271 --> 00:19:33,440
- Um...
- Really? Since when?

344
00:19:33,473 --> 00:19:35,977
Eh, I don't know.
Gets in these moods.

345
00:19:36,010 --> 00:19:37,979
Hey, Childs your food's here.

346
00:19:38,012 --> 00:19:40,180
[Childs]
Great, I'll be right there!

347
00:19:44,952 --> 00:19:47,220
Good morning, Sergeant Dash.

348
00:19:47,254 --> 00:19:48,355
Good morning, Skeeter...

349
00:19:48,388 --> 00:19:49,957
I mean, Childs.
How's it going Childs?

350
00:19:49,991 --> 00:19:52,259
Well, I'm just fine, thanks.

351
00:19:52,292 --> 00:19:54,227
So... Oh, thank you.

352
00:19:54,261 --> 00:19:56,463
Uh, what did Nina
order this morning?

353
00:19:56,496 --> 00:19:57,598
She go back to the ham and eggs?

354
00:19:57,632 --> 00:19:59,000
- [mutters]
- Ah! I bet she didn't.

355
00:19:59,033 --> 00:20:00,601
- [chuckles]
- She's a pretty tough chick.

356
00:20:00,635 --> 00:20:02,704
- I think she's rad.
- Rad?

357
00:20:02,737 --> 00:20:05,707
- What the hell does rad mean?
- It's abbreviated for radical.

358
00:20:05,740 --> 00:20:07,542
See? He knows.

359
00:20:07,575 --> 00:20:10,343
- [chuckles]
- Whatever, you guys are idiots.

360
00:20:10,377 --> 00:20:12,947
- Uh, is she still on her crusade?
- Yes, she is.

361
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:14,448
Uh, I'll catch up
with you guys later.

362
00:20:14,481 --> 00:20:16,450
Please, get me that report
on the dancer, Doc.

363
00:20:16,483 --> 00:20:17,785
- Absolutely.
- Please.

364
00:20:22,790 --> 00:20:23,958
Take the paper
out of the folder,

365
00:20:23,991 --> 00:20:25,526
and let's see
how we're doing in the pool.

366
00:20:31,666 --> 00:20:33,701
Ah, shit. I lost.

367
00:20:45,079 --> 00:20:46,948
Welcome home, Joe Gallo.

368
00:20:53,453 --> 00:20:54,789
Malloy...

369
00:21:09,402 --> 00:21:11,672
Large crowds have been seen
in bizarre gatherings

370
00:21:11,706 --> 00:21:14,441
in local cemeteries
throughout the Pittsburgh area.

371
00:21:14,474 --> 00:21:17,945
Police are investigating if there's a possible
connection with the graveyard vandalism

372
00:21:17,979 --> 00:21:20,047
that's been going on
throughout Pennsylvania.

373
00:21:20,081 --> 00:21:23,851
I'm Gerri Tauver
and this WTJC News New York.

374
00:21:23,885 --> 00:21:27,722
Have a great day, New York.
I will see you tomorrow.

375
00:21:27,755 --> 00:21:29,824
- [woman] And we're out.
- [bell ringing]

376
00:21:29,857 --> 00:21:31,759
Good job, everybody. Great show.

377
00:21:31,793 --> 00:21:33,961
Thomas, grab Gerri
a bottle of water.

378
00:21:33,995 --> 00:21:36,831
All right, guys,
let's get this going and get...

379
00:21:36,864 --> 00:21:40,333
[man on microphone]
<i>Gerri, Joe Gallo's been caught.</i>

380
00:21:40,367 --> 00:21:42,435
- What was that?
- <i>Yes, you heard me right.</i>

381
00:21:42,469 --> 00:21:44,505
- Joe Gallo?
- <i>Joe Gallo.</i>

382
00:21:44,539 --> 00:21:46,941
- Where is he at?
- He's gonna be processed in Amityville.

383
00:21:46,974 --> 00:21:49,409
Okay.
I want to cover that story.

384
00:21:49,442 --> 00:21:50,878
<i>Alright, I'll see you in a few.</i>

385
00:21:50,912 --> 00:21:52,345
On my way right now.

386
00:22:11,899 --> 00:22:13,901
God, this place
is falling apart.

387
00:22:32,119 --> 00:22:34,055
Jimmy?

388
00:22:34,088 --> 00:22:36,023
What's up, kid?
What's going on?

389
00:22:36,057 --> 00:22:39,060
[video game noises]

390
00:22:39,093 --> 00:22:40,728
Where's-where's your mother?

391
00:22:40,761 --> 00:22:41,762
She left.

392
00:22:41,796 --> 00:22:44,665
What do you mean she left?
I don't understand.

393
00:22:44,699 --> 00:22:46,466
Her and Beau
went away for the weekend.

394
00:22:46,499 --> 00:22:50,938
What? She just
dumped you off and took off?

395
00:22:50,972 --> 00:22:53,541
Yup, and she said she tried
to call you, but of course,

396
00:22:53,574 --> 00:22:55,643
as usual, you didn't answer.

397
00:22:56,476 --> 00:22:57,678
This is...

398
00:23:02,049 --> 00:23:05,820
[line ringing]

399
00:23:05,853 --> 00:23:07,889
- [Carrie] <i>Roy...</i>
- Carrie, how you just gonna drop the kid off

400
00:23:07,922 --> 00:23:09,891
without even talking to me?
I'm at work.

401
00:23:09,924 --> 00:23:11,726
We're moving stations.
You know that.

402
00:23:11,759 --> 00:23:13,426
I'm busy, and you go off
with your boyfriend...

403
00:23:13,460 --> 00:23:14,695
<i>Just deal with it. Bye.</i>

404
00:23:15,796 --> 00:23:18,465
[sighs]
Perfect.

405
00:23:24,005 --> 00:23:25,773
She didn't answer.

406
00:23:25,806 --> 00:23:27,474
I knew she wouldn't.

407
00:23:27,508 --> 00:23:28,709
Did you eat breakfast?

408
00:23:28,743 --> 00:23:30,511
Not hungry.

409
00:23:30,544 --> 00:23:32,813
[Dash] Okay, let me see,
who can I call so...

410
00:23:32,847 --> 00:23:34,782
- you're not bored?
- I'm not bored.

411
00:23:34,815 --> 00:23:36,751
I can help you out
around here if you'd like.

412
00:23:36,784 --> 00:23:38,152
Remember like
last time I was here?

413
00:23:38,185 --> 00:23:39,587
Just give me a second
to think, kid.

414
00:23:39,620 --> 00:23:40,688
Um...

415
00:23:40,721 --> 00:23:43,124
[sighs] I just...

416
00:23:43,157 --> 00:23:46,761
I just wish things could go back
to the way they used to be with us.

417
00:23:46,794 --> 00:23:48,596
Sorry if I ruined your weekend.

418
00:23:48,629 --> 00:23:50,097
No, no,
it's not your fault, kid.

419
00:23:50,131 --> 00:23:52,233
[stutters] It's not.

420
00:23:52,266 --> 00:23:54,702
I just didn't expect you to be
tossed in my lap like this.

421
00:23:54,735 --> 00:23:56,637
[scoffs] I feel like
that's always the case though.

422
00:23:56,671 --> 00:23:59,840
You're either too busy or just
don't want me around, I guess.

423
00:23:59,874 --> 00:24:03,244
[sighs]
Alright, let me see...

424
00:24:03,277 --> 00:24:05,846
I can drop you off at Nana's.

425
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:08,115
That's right,
today's chemo day for her.

426
00:24:08,149 --> 00:24:09,817
Hey, Dash!

427
00:24:09,850 --> 00:24:11,752
[sighs]

428
00:24:12,787 --> 00:24:14,487
Do I disappoint you?

429
00:24:15,690 --> 00:24:17,758
Dash, I need you in front...

430
00:24:17,792 --> 00:24:19,927
Yeah, I'm coming!

431
00:24:19,961 --> 00:24:21,963
No, you don't
disappointment me, kid.

432
00:24:21,996 --> 00:24:23,531
Alright, listen, stay here.

433
00:24:23,564 --> 00:24:25,700
Let me just figure
this shit out, alright.

434
00:24:25,733 --> 00:24:28,669
Uh, hey, if anyone's
a disappointment,

435
00:24:28,703 --> 00:24:30,037
I feel like it should be me.

436
00:24:33,708 --> 00:24:35,943
What an asshole!

437
00:24:37,211 --> 00:24:39,814
Yeah, that's my dad.

438
00:24:42,817 --> 00:24:45,886
Yep, still an asshole.

439
00:24:46,587 --> 00:24:47,989
[chuckles]

440
00:24:52,893 --> 00:24:54,695
[man indistinct]

441
00:24:54,729 --> 00:24:57,031
<i>Joe Gallo, the so-called
"Amityville Strangler",</i>

442
00:24:57,064 --> 00:24:58,199
<i>is it true
that you confessed to...</i>

443
00:24:58,232 --> 00:24:59,200
<i>What is this,
your hall of shame?</i>

444
00:24:59,233 --> 00:25:00,668
Man, you missed it earlier.

445
00:25:00,701 --> 00:25:02,570
That old lady out there,

446
00:25:02,603 --> 00:25:04,605
she's like "I hope
you get high cholesterol..."

447
00:25:04,638 --> 00:25:06,974
- [indistinct yelling]
- McQueen's here.

448
00:25:07,008 --> 00:25:09,844
- <i>One piggy, two piggy, three piggy.</i>
- <i>C'mon, tell me the story!</i>

449
00:25:09,877 --> 00:25:12,079
<i>McQueen.
Give me the story, McQueen.</i>

450
00:25:12,113 --> 00:25:13,414
<i>Later on, lady. Try then.</i>

451
00:25:13,447 --> 00:25:15,850
- <i>What about the dead dancer?</i>
- <i>You should come back... Hey!</i>

452
00:25:15,883 --> 00:25:19,286
What about the dead... C'mon.
C'mon!

453
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:21,222
McQueen are you still
using excessive force?

454
00:25:21,255 --> 00:25:23,124
Lady, do you see
any marks on this man?

455
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:28,596
Look, enough.
Stick with the truth.

456
00:25:28,629 --> 00:25:29,797
Where to with this one, Dashy?

457
00:25:29,830 --> 00:25:32,033
- Stick him in two.
- Ha! Suits him.

458
00:25:32,066 --> 00:25:34,268
- [Gerri] Let us get a story.
- Looks like a number two.

459
00:25:34,301 --> 00:25:35,736
[McQueen] Lady...

460
00:25:35,770 --> 00:25:37,772
[Gallo] Good to see you guys.

461
00:25:37,805 --> 00:25:40,608
[Gerri] Gallo, what about
the victim's family?

462
00:25:40,641 --> 00:25:42,877
- [Gallo] I didn't do it!
- [Gerri indistinct]

463
00:25:42,910 --> 00:25:44,645
- Tell me something!
- You want a story?

464
00:25:44,678 --> 00:25:46,747
- Yeah! I do, I do!
- Hey, far enough.

465
00:25:46,781 --> 00:25:49,316
- Hup, hup.
- Detective, can we get an interview?

466
00:25:49,350 --> 00:25:51,886
Detective! Detective!

467
00:25:51,919 --> 00:25:54,155
[Gallo] Get your hands off me!

468
00:25:54,188 --> 00:25:56,123
Miss Tauver. Mrs. Tauver.

469
00:25:56,157 --> 00:26:00,094
Hi, Lieutenant Howie Stevenson,
this is my precinct.

470
00:26:00,127 --> 00:26:01,662
- Hey. Yeah.
- You want an interview?

471
00:26:01,695 --> 00:26:03,130
Okay, come talk to me.

472
00:26:03,164 --> 00:26:04,832
- Come follow me.
- Did you get that.

473
00:26:04,865 --> 00:26:08,669
If you guys wanted to do an
interview later... [indistinct]

474
00:26:08,702 --> 00:26:10,871
Let's go get some permission.

475
00:26:12,339 --> 00:26:15,142
I would've had
to drive to Amityville

476
00:26:15,176 --> 00:26:19,747
to have all this happen.
So much drama in one place.

477
00:26:19,780 --> 00:26:22,683
All I wanna do is pay my ticket.

478
00:26:22,716 --> 00:26:24,885
Yeah, I'll be back
to process you.

479
00:26:24,919 --> 00:26:27,988
[soft chuckle] Don't worry you've
got a long time to hang out in here.

480
00:26:28,022 --> 00:26:31,292
Thanks, Officer Sterling!

481
00:26:31,325 --> 00:26:34,261
You think this all a joke,
don't you?

482
00:26:34,295 --> 00:26:35,963
Yeah.

483
00:26:35,996 --> 00:26:39,200
I know you destroyed all the
security footage from the club.

484
00:26:41,102 --> 00:26:42,336
But you forgot one.

485
00:26:44,004 --> 00:26:47,374
The one you choked
the life out of that girl

486
00:26:47,408 --> 00:26:50,978
for five... long minutes.

487
00:26:51,011 --> 00:26:52,780
The ATM machine.

488
00:26:52,813 --> 00:26:54,949
We've got that footage.

489
00:26:58,219 --> 00:27:01,055
In the end,
everything comes out in the wash.

490
00:27:01,088 --> 00:27:02,957
- I'm innocent!
- Yeah.

491
00:27:04,925 --> 00:27:08,028
Psst. Dumbass says what?

492
00:27:08,062 --> 00:27:09,864
[chuckles]
[yelps]

493
00:27:17,471 --> 00:27:19,773
[tense music playing]

494
00:28:08,322 --> 00:28:13,027
[sighs] Okay, will you at least
let her know that Mel called?

495
00:28:13,060 --> 00:28:16,297
Okay? Okay, thanks.

496
00:28:16,330 --> 00:28:19,733

00:28:32,079 --> 00:28:33,814
What kind of shit is that?

502
00:28:33,847 --> 00:28:36,183
That doesn't even make no sense.

Unbelievable.

There's the big old acid rain.

507
00:28:53,267 --> 00:28:54,268
What the...?

00:29:58,165 --> 00:30:00,100
[news intro music playing]

511
00:30:02,637 --> 00:30:05,105
[laughing]
<i>I know, I know,</i>

512
00:30:05,139 --> 00:30:07,174
<i>blame the weather man.
Blame the weather man.</i>

513
00:30:07,207 --> 00:30:08,909
<i>But, seriously, folks,</i>

514
00:30:08,942 --> 00:30:11,078
<i>we are in for
some beautiful weather,</i>

515
00:30:11,111 --> 00:30:13,881
<i>as you can see on the chart right
here, later in the week.</i>

516
00:30:13,914 --> 00:30:16,317
<i>And I'm talking nothing
but gorgeous sunshine.</i>

517
00:30:16,350 --> 00:30:19,019
<i>So it's gonna be really nice to
experience that later in the week.</i>

518
00:30:19,053 --> 00:30:20,988
<i>However, I want to
reiterate the fact</i>

519
00:30:21,021 --> 00:30:24,291
<i>that the governor has handed
down a red district warning.</i>

520
00:30:24,325 --> 00:30:27,494
<i>And that's due to this
unstable, uncharacteristically</i>

521
00:30:27,529 --> 00:30:30,164
<i>bizarre weather we're
experiencing right now.</i>

522
00:30:30,197 --> 00:30:31,932
<i>That was due to
the chemical explosion</i>

523
00:30:31,965 --> 00:30:33,367
<i>at the military base,
of course.</i>

524
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:35,469
<i>Uh, so just be careful
out there, and, uh...</i>

525
00:30:35,503 --> 00:30:39,073
<i>Jim, why don't you tell us about
those Wolverines last night, huh?</i>

526
00:30:39,106 --> 00:30:42,042
<i>In that three-point
overtime loss.</i>

527
00:30:42,076 --> 00:30:45,379
<i>My dog coulda kicked a better field goal
than that one, and Charlie has one leg.</i>

528
00:30:45,412 --> 00:30:48,148
[chuckles] <i>We are off
the air right now, right?</i>

529
00:30:48,182 --> 00:30:49,049
<i>They heard that?</i>

530
00:30:49,083 --> 00:30:50,984
[chuckles]
<i>Well, you know me, folks,</i>

531
00:30:51,018 --> 00:30:53,187
<i>uh, always making a joke.</i>
[chuckles]

532
00:30:53,220 --> 00:30:54,522
<i>All right.</i>

533
00:30:54,556 --> 00:30:56,423
[toilet flushing]

534
00:30:58,959 --> 00:31:01,295
[whistling]

535
00:31:24,351 --> 00:31:26,954
Ah, I love the aroma
of this place.

536
00:31:26,987 --> 00:31:28,922
Hey, Childs, can you
clean out those sinks!

537
00:31:28,956 --> 00:31:30,357
- [yells]
- Childs...

538
00:31:31,225 --> 00:31:32,459
Where are you?

539
00:31:33,093 --> 00:31:35,362
[gasps]

540
00:31:35,396 --> 00:31:38,700
[Ira] Eh, it's just a muscle spasm.
It hit a nerve.

541
00:31:38,733 --> 00:31:40,300
Rigor mortis set in.

542
00:31:41,268 --> 00:31:42,504
Happens all the time.

543
00:31:42,537 --> 00:31:45,707
- All the time?
- All the time.

544
00:31:45,740 --> 00:31:48,008
How do you do it?

545
00:31:49,511 --> 00:31:50,978
Experience, kid.

546
00:31:51,011 --> 00:31:52,413
- Oh...
- Experience.

547
00:31:56,551 --> 00:31:59,353
All I know
is he went to do a sound gig

548
00:31:59,386 --> 00:32:01,155
and he never came back home.

549
00:32:04,626 --> 00:32:06,093
Uh, Dash.

550
00:32:06,126 --> 00:32:07,961
One second.

551
00:32:07,995 --> 00:32:10,164
Mr. Cooper,
this is Sergeant Dash.

552
00:32:10,197 --> 00:32:12,399
- Nice to meet you.
- He's gonna assist you with the rest of this.

553
00:32:12,433 --> 00:32:14,301
Thank you for your patience.

554
00:32:14,334 --> 00:32:15,537
I got it.

555
00:32:15,570 --> 00:32:17,171
Hey, Mr. Cooper.

556
00:32:18,405 --> 00:32:20,407
Alright...

557
00:32:20,441 --> 00:32:22,644
Okay, so tell me
about your brother.

558
00:32:22,677 --> 00:32:25,680
He's been missing
about two weeks?

559
00:32:25,713 --> 00:32:29,416
Did he have any other names or
aliases he might've gone by?

560
00:32:29,450 --> 00:32:34,321
- You left that out of the report.
- Yeah, I-I guess, uh...

561
00:32:34,354 --> 00:32:39,293
He had a nickname he used in his
industry, uh, he's goes by Scratch.

562
00:32:39,326 --> 00:32:42,329
- Scratch?
- Cor... Yes, Scratch.

563
00:32:42,362 --> 00:32:46,467
Okay. Industry.
What type of work did he do?

564
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:48,435
Oh, he's in entertainment.

565
00:32:48,469 --> 00:32:52,707
- He does sound for movies.
- [thunder rumbles]

566
00:32:52,740 --> 00:32:55,577
Okay, uh, Sam, if you just
have a seat over there

567
00:32:55,610 --> 00:32:57,512
while I run a few reports
I'd appreciate it.

568
00:32:57,545 --> 00:33:00,515
Thanks, and, uh,
where's the closest bathroom?

569
00:33:00,548 --> 00:33:02,717
Um, you can just go through
that door right there,

570
00:33:02,750 --> 00:33:05,285
head down to the right,
and your down on the right...

571
00:33:05,319 --> 00:33:07,087
- Hey, you cut in line!
- [overlapping chatter]

572
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:09,624
- I was here first!
- What's your issue?

573
00:33:09,657 --> 00:33:12,326
Go to hell, asshole!
[grunts]

574
00:33:12,359 --> 00:33:14,562
- Ma'am...
- I have been waiting all day.

575
00:33:14,596 --> 00:33:16,531
You do not lay
your hands on somebody.

576
00:33:16,564 --> 00:33:20,668
Can I pay this ticket already?

577
00:33:20,702 --> 00:33:23,103
As I told you before, yes.

578
00:33:23,136 --> 00:33:25,372
- But you...
- This is just stupid.

579
00:33:25,405 --> 00:33:28,510
Your system is stupid!

580
00:33:28,543 --> 00:33:30,444
Ma'am, please.

581
00:33:30,477 --> 00:33:32,714
Have a seat and we will
help you out soon.

582
00:33:32,747 --> 00:33:35,249
- You've said that 20 times!
- Please.

583
00:33:35,282 --> 00:33:36,383
[groans]

584
00:33:38,452 --> 00:33:39,453
Thank you.

585
00:33:39,486 --> 00:33:42,690
[thunder rumbles]

586
00:33:42,724 --> 00:33:45,025
Don't ever lay your hands
on somebody in my station.

587
00:33:50,097 --> 00:33:51,398
[door rattles]

588
00:33:53,735 --> 00:33:57,337
[door rattles]

589
00:34:01,275 --> 00:34:03,143
I'll be out pinning up
the new ones.

590
00:34:03,176 --> 00:34:04,144
[Dash] Okay.

591
00:34:06,814 --> 00:34:08,448
- Hi, can I help you?
- Hi.

592
00:34:08,482 --> 00:34:11,418
[chuckles] Yes, I'm looking
for the bathroom.

593
00:34:11,451 --> 00:34:12,319
- Bathroom?
- Yes.

594
00:34:12,352 --> 00:34:14,421
Right down this hallway,
follow the signs,

595
00:34:14,454 --> 00:34:16,390
if you hit the jail cell
you've gone too far.

596
00:34:16,423 --> 00:34:17,559
Thank you.

597
00:34:21,128 --> 00:34:23,798
Hey, Malloy, I need you to get those,
uh, tools out of the jail area.

598
00:34:23,831 --> 00:34:25,098
[clicks tongue]

599
00:34:26,734 --> 00:34:29,169
- Hey, Brian. Morning.
- Hey, doll.

600
00:34:33,641 --> 00:34:35,777
[thunder rumbles]

601
00:34:35,810 --> 00:34:40,882
Hey, it's after 9:00 am!

602
00:34:40,915 --> 00:34:44,786
Can someone, please,
for the love of God...

603
00:34:44,819 --> 00:34:46,386
[Dash]
If you just give me a minute,

604
00:34:46,420 --> 00:34:47,722
I'd be more than happy
to help you.

605
00:34:47,755 --> 00:34:49,289
[woman] Help me!

606
00:34:59,934 --> 00:35:01,234
[door locks]

607
00:35:01,268 --> 00:35:02,870
I mean, really.

608
00:35:02,904 --> 00:35:06,808
I need to get back to the city!

609
00:35:06,841 --> 00:35:09,744
And nobody has helped me yet.

610
00:35:09,777 --> 00:35:11,378
Yes, I am aware.

611
00:35:11,411 --> 00:35:14,849
No, no, no!

612
00:35:16,818 --> 00:35:18,318
Yep...

613
00:35:20,622 --> 00:35:22,724
- Hey, Brian...
- [woman] I'm not going to sit down!

614
00:35:22,757 --> 00:35:25,325
- What's with her?
- Oh, your typical pissed off lady.

615
00:35:25,359 --> 00:35:27,294
But this one's on steroids.

616
00:35:27,327 --> 00:35:29,496
- [woman] No!
- Ma'am, our clerk called out sick today,

617
00:35:29,530 --> 00:35:32,634
so if you just give me five minutes,
I'd be more than happy to assist you.

618
00:35:32,667 --> 00:35:33,701
Help me!

619
00:35:33,735 --> 00:35:36,904
- Ma'am...
- [Jimmy] Lady, relax.

620
00:35:36,938 --> 00:35:38,405
He said he'll be
with you in a minute.

621
00:35:38,438 --> 00:35:40,340
And getting all pissy with him
isn't gonna help.

622
00:35:40,374 --> 00:35:42,309
[laughing]

623
00:35:42,342 --> 00:35:44,846
[woman]
Karma! That's what it is.

624
00:35:44,879 --> 00:35:46,748
Jimmy, come back here
with me, please.

625
00:35:46,781 --> 00:35:49,751
- [woman] Karma!
- [Dash] Are you done, ma'am?

626
00:35:49,784 --> 00:35:51,385
Is there something
I can help you with?

627
00:35:51,418 --> 00:35:52,486
No, son, not right now.

628
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:54,287
Just have a seat right there,
at my desk, please.

629
00:35:54,321 --> 00:35:55,723
Holy shit!

630
00:35:55,757 --> 00:35:57,324
I hear you're going on
vacation next week.

631
00:35:57,357 --> 00:35:58,660
Yes, I so can't wait.

632
00:35:58,693 --> 00:36:00,193
I'm heading home for a few days.

633
00:36:00,227 --> 00:36:02,563
- Nice.
- Did they make coffee yet?

634
00:36:02,597 --> 00:36:04,264
Yeah, but it's decaf.

635
00:36:04,297 --> 00:36:06,500
- Why do we keep doing this?
- [woman] No, no!

636
00:36:06,534 --> 00:36:08,569
Who keeps making decaf?
I gotta talk to somebody.

637
00:36:08,603 --> 00:36:11,673
Ma'am, I'm just asking for
a few minutes.

638
00:36:11,706 --> 00:36:13,407
- Please, I will help you.
- [groans]

639
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:14,909
How you been?

640
00:36:14,942 --> 00:36:17,578
- You've been saying that!
- [Dash] Please.

641
00:36:22,016 --> 00:36:23,685
[Jimmy] At least somebody's
happy to see me, right?

642
00:36:23,718 --> 00:36:24,886
Hey, stop that.

643
00:36:24,919 --> 00:36:26,453
Your father adores you.

644
00:36:26,486 --> 00:36:28,589
- Yeah.
- Just look over at his wall.

645
00:36:28,623 --> 00:36:33,360
You're plastered everywhere, kid,
it's like, the wall of Jimmy Dash.

646
00:36:33,393 --> 00:36:35,830
- [chuckles]
- I guess.

647
00:36:35,863 --> 00:36:39,499
Oh, wow, he even has my Little
League baseball card here.

648
00:36:39,534 --> 00:36:42,737
See? Go ahead
with your bad self.

649
00:36:42,770 --> 00:36:46,373
He's got every special day,
every special event.

650
00:36:46,406 --> 00:36:48,241
He's got it all.

651
00:36:48,275 --> 00:36:50,745
- Guess so.
- Just look... You can come across if you want.

652
00:36:50,778 --> 00:36:51,879
[whispers] I won't tell him.

653
00:36:51,913 --> 00:36:52,947
[laughs]

654
00:36:57,051 --> 00:36:58,418
[whispers] Thank you.

655
00:36:58,452 --> 00:37:02,289
Ah, don't worry about it.
I adore Jimmy.

656
00:37:02,322 --> 00:37:05,459
Yeah, sometimes I just wish
I could hit the restart button.

657
00:37:05,492 --> 00:37:06,861
You know?

658
00:37:06,894 --> 00:37:08,863
You can.

659
00:37:08,896 --> 00:37:11,699
See, I think that's why we get
various days to do it right.

660
00:37:11,733 --> 00:37:14,702
It's almost like every day
is a restart button.

661
00:37:14,736 --> 00:37:16,403
[thunder rumbles]

662
00:37:16,436 --> 00:37:19,439
Oh, my God,
did I just give you advice? Whoo.

663
00:37:19,473 --> 00:37:21,709
- [chuckles]
- I believe you did, Rossi.

664
00:37:21,743 --> 00:37:23,811
Thank you.
I am grateful.

665
00:37:25,412 --> 00:37:27,615
I will help with
Miss Impatient over there.

666
00:37:29,483 --> 00:37:30,551
I'm really grateful.

667
00:37:35,322 --> 00:37:37,658
Good morning, ma'am.
How can I help you today?

668
00:37:37,692 --> 00:37:41,596
- [woman] Finally! Someone.
- Yeah.

669
00:37:49,637 --> 00:37:51,906
[clicking]

670
00:37:51,939 --> 00:37:53,373
Can you do
one sideways, too?

671
00:37:56,544 --> 00:37:57,578
Thank you.

672
00:37:58,946 --> 00:38:01,414
Oh, you look great!

673
00:38:01,448 --> 00:38:03,918
Twenty minutes, guys.
That's all I can give you.

674
00:38:03,951 --> 00:38:06,087
That is all we need,
Lieutenant Stevenson.

675
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:07,989
Oh, please, call me Howie.

676
00:38:08,022 --> 00:38:09,891
- Okay.
- Follow me, please.

677
00:38:09,924 --> 00:38:11,826
I will show you all
to the holding cells.

678
00:38:11,859 --> 00:38:13,460
[mouthing]

679
00:38:13,493 --> 00:38:15,530
Thanks, really appreciate this.

680
00:38:21,434 --> 00:38:23,738
- What's this?
- Peace offering.

681
00:38:23,771 --> 00:38:25,973
We had an extra bacon, egg
and cheese sandwich.

682
00:38:27,575 --> 00:38:29,710
Jimmy, I know you feel...

683
00:38:29,744 --> 00:38:31,846
Can I get a black coffee
instead of the soda?

684
00:38:31,879 --> 00:38:34,347
Yeah, sure.

685
00:38:34,381 --> 00:38:36,617
- Uh, Nina, can you...
- On it. Just black?

686
00:38:36,651 --> 00:38:38,485
[Dash] Mm-hm. You're the best.

687
00:38:38,519 --> 00:38:42,790
I feel like at times...
you resent me.

688
00:38:42,824 --> 00:38:46,828
No, you need to
understand something.

689
00:38:46,861 --> 00:38:49,797
Your mother and I,
we shouldn't have happened.

690
00:38:49,831 --> 00:38:51,866
We're like oil and water.

691
00:38:51,899 --> 00:38:54,434
We just never could mesh
and handle things.

692
00:38:54,467 --> 00:38:55,937
We always fought.

693
00:38:59,574 --> 00:39:02,009
Mom told me that you
married her because of me.

694
00:39:02,043 --> 00:39:04,377
And that's why
you guys always fought.

695
00:39:04,411 --> 00:39:07,915
'Cause you felt
trapped with her.

696
00:39:07,949 --> 00:39:10,483
Your mother,
she told you this?

697
00:39:11,152 --> 00:39:12,352
Yeah.

698
00:39:13,888 --> 00:39:16,389
You did come as a surprise.

699
00:39:16,423 --> 00:39:18,626
I don't regret you,
I never have, son.

700
00:39:19,527 --> 00:39:20,928
I tried.

701
00:39:20,962 --> 00:39:23,363
I tried my hardest to make
things work with your mom.

702
00:39:24,497 --> 00:39:26,634
We just...
we never got along.

703
00:39:26,667 --> 00:39:28,536
We just constantly fought.

704
00:39:30,738 --> 00:39:34,008
[thunder rumbles]

705
00:39:34,041 --> 00:39:36,777
Oh, Malloy, I need you to start
on that closet in the morgue.

706
00:39:36,811 --> 00:39:38,145
I'd like to finish
that by today.

707
00:39:38,179 --> 00:39:39,412
You got it, boss.

708
00:39:39,446 --> 00:39:41,883
You say I came as a surprise?

709
00:39:41,916 --> 00:39:43,851
Is that why you left me?

710
00:39:43,885 --> 00:39:46,020
[Dash] No, I-I never left you.

711
00:39:46,053 --> 00:39:49,790
I left because I didn't think it was the
most healthy environment to raise you in.

712
00:39:49,824 --> 00:39:51,993
The yelling, the fighting...

713
00:39:53,027 --> 00:39:54,128
Your birth...

714
00:39:55,663 --> 00:39:57,565
That was the best chapter
of my life.

715
00:39:58,866 --> 00:40:00,134
I love you, boy.

716
00:40:00,167 --> 00:40:02,703
You're my son,
that will never change.

717
00:40:02,737 --> 00:40:05,673
I know I missed
some life events.

718
00:40:06,874 --> 00:40:08,441
But it was because of work,

719
00:40:08,475 --> 00:40:10,811
never because
I resented you, ever.

720
00:40:11,779 --> 00:40:13,881
I'm so proud of you.

721
00:40:13,915 --> 00:40:15,850
I'm proud of the kid
that you are and...

722
00:40:15,883 --> 00:40:17,685
proud of the man you'll become.

723
00:40:18,686 --> 00:40:20,121
I love you too, Dad.

724
00:40:20,154 --> 00:40:21,522
Being that we're gonna...

725
00:40:21,555 --> 00:40:22,757
You're gonna be here
with me all day,

726
00:40:22,790 --> 00:40:26,794
how about you helping me out,
and I, uh, throw you 50 bucks?

727
00:40:26,827 --> 00:40:28,062
Sixty?

728
00:40:28,095 --> 00:40:29,163
How about 40?

729
00:40:29,196 --> 00:40:30,898
Okay, I like the sound of 50.

730
00:40:30,932 --> 00:40:34,001
Alright. Hey, Malloy,
I got a good helper for you.

731
00:40:34,035 --> 00:40:37,038
Hey, you listen to what he
says, you do what he says.

732
00:40:37,071 --> 00:40:38,773
Awesome, less work for me.

733
00:40:38,806 --> 00:40:41,976
Let's go, kid. First we gotta
stop and get the... ladder.

734
00:40:42,009 --> 00:40:43,044
[muttering]

735

736
00:40:51,252 --> 00:40:54,221
[woman] Excuse me!

737
00:40:54,255 --> 00:40:55,690
Ma'am, just please calm down.

738
00:40:55,723 --> 00:40:57,558
- It was my fault.
- Really?

739
00:40:57,591 --> 00:40:59,093
- I got distracted by all the commotion.
- Really?

740
00:40:59,961 --> 00:41:01,896
I'm done!

741
00:41:01,929 --> 00:41:04,231
[softly]
Okay, that's unnecessary.

742
00:41:04,265 --> 00:41:05,766
[woman screaming, grumbling]

743
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:07,568
Can you go grab that woman?

744
00:41:07,601 --> 00:41:09,670
Ma'am, I can assist you.

745
00:41:10,671 --> 00:41:12,974
[grunts]

746
00:41:13,007 --> 00:41:15,475
I'm sorry, ma'am,
I can assist you.

747
00:41:17,678 --> 00:41:19,981
Ma'am, please come back inside,
it's raining.

like this before.</i>

755
00:42:37,124 --> 00:42:39,060
<i>But it appears
that the rain is deadly.</i>

756
00:42:39,093 --> 00:42:40,961
<i>That's right,
the rain is deadly.</i>

757
00:42:40,995 --> 00:42:43,597

- God, I hate coming down here.

763
00:43:02,016 --> 00:43:03,150
Ira!

764
00:43:04,151 --> 00:43:06,153
We need help.

765
00:43:06,187 --> 00:43:09,990
- [grunting]
- One, two, three.

766
00:43:12,893 --> 00:43:13,794
[Ira] What happened here?

767
00:43:13,828 --> 00:43:16,730
- Rain, burned her.
- The rain did that?

768
00:43:17,898 --> 00:43:20,000
[overlapping chatter]

right there.

- What do you want me to do?
- Really, dude?

773
00:43:35,149 --> 00:43:39,220
You work in a freaking morgue.
Get your ass up.

774
00:43:39,253 --> 00:43:41,222
Can you guys
go upstairs, please?

775
00:43:41,255 --> 00:43:42,990
Authorized personnel only!

776
00:43:43,023 --> 00:43:45,359
Okay, get the hell outta here.

Can you clean up a bit?
Bandage her up, Doc?

00:43:48,762 --> 00:43:51,065
Bandages? I don't know, I think
she needs to go to the hospital.

780
00:43:51,098 --> 00:43:53,434
You can't go outside,
the rain will literally tear you apart!

781

- Maybe even kill you, you can't.
- Please, go upstairs. Please.

Nobody's leaving
the station, okay.

783
00:43:57,738 --> 00:44:01,208
God knows who or what's trapped
out there in those streets.

784
00:44:38,445 --> 00:44:39,947

Sergeant Dash,
this is Officer Nina Ross...

- Ser... Sergeant? Sergeant?

00:46:05,199 --> 00:46:07,368
Hi, my pretty.

[laughing]

800
00:46:34,495 --> 00:46:36,096
Is that the dancer
from the Gallo case?

801
00:46:36,130 --> 00:46:38,098
Guys, please, back.
Please, please, back, back.

802
00:46:38,132 --> 00:46:40,501
What... What're you doing here?

803
00:46:40,535 --> 00:46:43,003
- What happened to her?
- Hey! Do what I asked.

804
00:46:43,037 --> 00:46:44,204
You don't need to be in here.
Go!

805
00:46:44,238 --> 00:46:45,607
What're you doing?

806
00:46:45,640 --> 00:46:47,975
Don't make this about ratings,
she needs help!

807
00:47:37,491 --> 00:47:38,926
No, no, no...

808
00:47:38,959 --> 00:47:40,628
Hey, Jimmy,
have you seen my flathead

809
00:47:40,662 --> 00:47:42,630
- or-or my tape measure?
- Nope.

810
00:47:42,664 --> 00:47:45,032
Hm.
I know where I left 'em.

811
00:47:45,065 --> 00:47:47,401
I'm gonna go get them and
hit the restroom first. Okay?

812
00:47:47,434 --> 00:47:49,370
Alright, no problem.
Um, can you get me a soda?

813
00:47:49,403 --> 00:47:51,972
- Like a diet pop, maybe?
- Sure, sure. You got it kid.

814
00:47:52,005 --> 00:47:53,140
Alright, thanks.

Hey, guys,
what's with all the commotion?

817
00:48:06,120 --> 00:48:08,255
She nearly got herself
killed outside in the rain.

818
00:48:08,288 --> 00:48:10,190
She needs
medical attention, Doc.

819
00:48:10,224 --> 00:48:12,594
Medical attention? How?

820
00:48:12,627 --> 00:48:15,062
- I'm a morgue technician.
- [woman groans]

821
00:48:15,095 --> 00:48:16,631
- Help me.
- Oh, my God.

822
00:48:16,664 --> 00:48:21,101
[woman panting]
Help me.

823
00:48:21,135 --> 00:48:22,469
Take this off her.

824
00:48:24,037 --> 00:48:26,340
[gasping]

825
00:48:37,552 --> 00:48:39,621
- This burns!
- Go wash your hands, kid.

826
00:48:42,590 --> 00:48:45,025
Out of order!
Son of a bitch!

827
00:48:46,694 --> 00:48:49,163
We don't know the extent
of what it can do.

828
00:48:49,196 --> 00:48:51,533
Well, we know it
burns your damn skin.

829
00:48:57,438 --> 00:49:00,642
Looking at this woman's face,
I'd say the rain

830
00:49:00,675 --> 00:49:03,745
has turned into a high corrosive
form of hydrochloric acid.

831
00:49:03,778 --> 00:49:07,014
Um, should wipe
everything down with water.

832
00:49:08,415 --> 00:49:09,584
[groans]

833
00:49:16,524 --> 00:49:19,226
It should've been you.

834
00:49:19,259 --> 00:49:21,529
You shoulda been
the one who vanished.

835
00:49:24,498 --> 00:49:26,200
Not Steve.

836
00:49:28,168 --> 00:49:29,537
You're worthless.

837
00:49:29,571 --> 00:49:32,406
You can't hold down a job...

839
00:49:36,511 --> 00:49:38,345
I hate being you.

841
00:49:55,563 --> 00:49:59,767
Maybe I should go see
Father Michael... [muttering]

00:50:03,671 --> 00:50:06,173
[yelling]
Son of a bitch, it burns!

843
00:50:07,542 --> 00:50:10,277
Move!
[grunting]

844
00:50:10,310 --> 00:50:11,679
Officer, are you okay?

845
00:50:11,713 --> 00:50:13,748
Out of order!
I need water!

846
00:50:13,781 --> 00:50:15,550
I need water!
[whimpering]

847
00:50:15,583 --> 00:50:16,684
Doc, please help her.

848
00:50:18,853 --> 00:50:21,556
I can't, Dashy, she's dead.

849
00:50:23,390 --> 00:50:24,424
Ah, damn it.

850
00:50:24,458 --> 00:50:27,127
[Ira] Who is she?

851
00:50:27,160 --> 00:50:28,462
Some woman
who came to pay a ticket.

852
00:50:30,397 --> 00:50:31,633
I guess we can dismiss that.

853
00:50:31,666 --> 00:50:33,233
Wow.

854
00:50:35,269 --> 00:50:37,839

859
00:50:56,858 --> 00:50:58,726

Are you alright?

863
00:51:12,874 --> 00:51:14,776

00:51:22,215 --> 00:51:24,151
Oh, thank God,

[Howie] So, what happened
to your camera?

893
00:53:28,341 --> 00:53:31,012
[Gerri] Uh, the battery died,
so I guess I need a new one.

894
00:53:31,045 --> 00:53:32,513
- Got ya.
- Yeah.

895
00:53:32,547 --> 00:53:34,381
- Pardon our mess.
- Oh, it's fine.

896
00:53:34,414 --> 00:53:36,684
We're merging precincts,
I'm sure you know.

897
00:53:36,718 --> 00:53:38,285
Joe Gallo.

898
00:53:38,318 --> 00:53:40,621
Miss Tauver here would like
a moment of your time.

899
00:53:40,655 --> 00:53:41,956
Hope you're not busy.

900
00:53:50,330 --> 00:53:52,767
[clears throat]
Um, I will get you all a chair.

901
00:53:52,800 --> 00:53:54,334
- We're good.
- You sure?

902
00:53:54,367 --> 00:53:56,604
Yeah, but we would
like that 20 minutes.

903
00:53:56,637 --> 00:54:00,608
Twenty minutes. And be sure to stay
at least two feet away from the cell.

904
00:54:00,641 --> 00:54:03,745
And I'm gonna trust the two
of you all to make your way

905
00:54:03,778 --> 00:54:05,378
back to the front
when you're done.

906
00:54:05,412 --> 00:54:06,514
Got it.

907
00:54:06,547 --> 00:54:08,549
- Thank you, Lieutenant.
- You're welcome.

908
00:54:08,583 --> 00:54:10,317
And Howie, please.

909
00:54:10,350 --> 00:54:12,419
Mm-hm.

910
00:54:12,452 --> 00:54:14,622
Make sure you stop by my office
before you all leave.

911
00:54:14,655 --> 00:54:15,723
[Gerri] Okay.

912
00:54:17,390 --> 00:54:18,425
Joe Gallo...

913
00:54:20,094 --> 00:54:21,729
are you ready for us?

914
00:54:25,933 --> 00:54:27,501
I'm always ready.

915
00:54:27,535 --> 00:54:28,536
Good.

916
00:54:30,938 --> 00:54:33,273
[thunder rumbles]

917
00:54:39,647 --> 00:54:42,817
[Ira] Hey, Childs, a little bit
of flashlight or something.

918
00:54:42,850 --> 00:54:44,919
I don't wanna be
bumping into shit all day.

919
00:54:44,952 --> 00:54:47,955
Well, I'm trying.
Where are those candles from last week?

920
00:54:47,989 --> 00:54:49,791
I can't see shit.

921
00:54:50,725 --> 00:54:52,660
Oh, never mind.

922
00:54:52,693 --> 00:54:54,829
- I found a lighter.
- [Ira] Good, great.

923
00:54:54,862 --> 00:54:56,964
Great, use the lighter
to find the flashlight.

924
00:54:56,998 --> 00:54:58,699
Alright!

925
00:54:59,432 --> 00:55:00,668
[groans]

926
00:55:01,869 --> 00:55:03,470
[screams]

927
00:55:03,504 --> 00:55:05,006
Ira, Willy, you there?

928
00:55:05,840 --> 00:55:08,308
Childs, John Childs.

929
00:55:19,987 --> 00:55:22,422
I tried everything.
All the equipment is dead.

930
00:55:22,455 --> 00:55:26,060
Is it because of the rain?
Cable, phones, radio.

931
00:55:26,093 --> 00:55:28,495
[Dash] Childs. John Childs.

932
00:55:28,529 --> 00:55:30,064
Ira, Willy, you there?

933
00:55:33,034 --> 00:55:34,569
What're you digging for?

934
00:55:34,602 --> 00:55:36,003
That lighter was mine,
by the way.

935
00:55:36,037 --> 00:55:38,105
- Just joking. [chuckles]
- Please.

936
00:55:38,139 --> 00:55:39,574
Being all the lines are down,

937
00:55:39,607 --> 00:55:41,876
I was looking for
a prepaid phone, you know?

938
00:55:41,909 --> 00:55:43,144
A burner phone?

939
00:55:43,177 --> 00:55:45,378
Yeah, yeah, a burner.
They would get service.

940
00:55:45,412 --> 00:55:47,548
[thunder rumbles]

941
00:55:49,083 --> 00:55:51,418
- Try this one.
- You have a burner?

942
00:55:51,451 --> 00:55:52,753
It-it's a work phone.

943
00:55:52,787 --> 00:55:54,789
[Dash]
Ira, anyone in the morgue?

944
00:55:56,724 --> 00:55:57,959
Malloy...

945
00:55:59,827 --> 00:56:01,095
You went outside?

946
00:56:01,128 --> 00:56:03,598
- Your shirt's wet.
- [Howie] No shit.

947
00:56:06,534 --> 00:56:08,936
I just peaked out
the side door.

948
00:56:08,970 --> 00:56:12,039
- How is it?
- Hot as a bitch out there.

949
00:56:13,007 --> 00:56:15,509
Rain is boiling hot, man.

950
00:56:16,177 --> 00:56:17,745
Some biblical shit.

951
00:56:19,146 --> 00:56:20,948
- You hear from, Ira?
- No.

952
00:56:24,518 --> 00:56:27,054
The phone's dead.
It seemed to let me text my friend Seth.

953
00:56:27,088 --> 00:56:28,589
I'll see if he replies.

954
00:56:31,859 --> 00:56:33,060
Did you hear from him?

955
00:56:33,094 --> 00:56:34,829
It's only been like ten minutes.

956
00:56:37,865 --> 00:56:39,100
Hey, Rossi.

957
00:56:39,133 --> 00:56:40,635
Do me a favor
and go get the TV people

958
00:56:40,668 --> 00:56:41,802
from their interview.

959
00:56:41,836 --> 00:56:43,571
The deal was for 20 minutes.

960
00:56:43,604 --> 00:56:45,573
[thunder rumbles]

961
00:56:47,808 --> 00:56:49,777
Man, I ain't never
seen no shit like this.

962
00:56:49,810 --> 00:56:51,712
Man, this is...

963
00:56:51,746 --> 00:56:54,582
worse than the time we were
all locked down for quarantine

964
00:56:54,615 --> 00:56:55,850
from the virus.

965
00:56:56,784 --> 00:56:58,152
Yeah.

966
00:56:58,185 --> 00:57:01,055
I was told that there was
three dead women by you.

967
00:57:01,088 --> 00:57:02,823
- Joe Gallo, how do you feel?
- I'm innocent.

968
00:57:02,857 --> 00:57:04,457
How do you feel
about all this?

969
00:57:04,491 --> 00:57:05,960
What's going on
through your mind?

970
00:57:09,764 --> 00:57:11,464
- How do you feel?
- Go to hell.

971
00:57:11,498 --> 00:57:12,733
I wanna talk to my lawyer.

972
00:57:12,767 --> 00:57:14,902
You seem like
you really don't care.

973
00:57:16,270 --> 00:57:18,906
You seem relaxed
about all of it.

974
00:57:21,509 --> 00:57:23,811
We deserve to hear
what's going.

975
00:57:25,179 --> 00:57:26,514
I'm innocent.

976
00:57:26,547 --> 00:57:29,150
Pico... Pico...

977
00:57:29,183 --> 00:57:31,619
Pico, you need to get the shot.

This is Officer Nina Rossi.

I repeat,
this is Officer Nina Rossi.

985
00:58:51,065 --> 00:58:52,166
Can anyone hear me?

Is someone in the bathroom?

This is Officer Nina Rossi.

992

I understand!

1003
00:59:51,659 --> 00:59:54,095
I need you
to drop the screwdriver,

1004
00:59:54,128 --> 00:59:56,730
and put your hands
above your head.

1005
00:59:56,764 --> 01:00:01,669

Oh, sorry,

Alright, you're good.
What's going on out there?

1020
01:01:52,012 --> 01:01:54,315
Oh, nothing. We just lost
a little bit of power.

1021
01:01:54,348 --> 01:01:55,883
We should be back on

- Scare who?
- You.

01:02:45,466 --> 01:02:47,234
[thunder rumbles]

1032
01:02:47,268 --> 01:02:49,169
I think we need
a new coffee pot.

1033
01:02:52,039 --> 01:02:54,008
This one's broke.

1034
01:02:54,041 --> 01:02:55,409
[grunting]

1035
01:03:04,318 --> 01:03:06,554
[Howie] What the hell?

1036
01:03:06,588 --> 01:03:10,090
Guys, there's something
in here with us.

1037
01:03:10,124 --> 01:03:11,492
What do you mean?

1038
01:03:11,526 --> 01:03:14,928
I said there's something
in here with us.

1039
01:03:18,600 --> 01:03:21,001
[McQueen]
Something we're not sure of?

1040
01:03:21,035 --> 01:03:23,137
No, it was right here!

1041
01:03:23,170 --> 01:03:25,372
I mean, we have rats
in the station at night.

1042
01:03:25,406 --> 01:03:27,542
I've seen 'em.
They're-they're big, like small cats.

1043
01:03:32,379 --> 01:03:33,548
What the hell is that?

1044
01:03:36,350 --> 01:03:37,619
That's no rat.

1045
01:03:37,652 --> 01:03:40,321
- That-that's...
- [McQueen] Where'd it go?

1046
01:03:40,354 --> 01:03:41,623
[Dash] Did you see it?
You see it?

1047
01:03:41,656 --> 01:03:43,957
Yes.

1048
01:03:43,991 --> 01:03:46,327
Looked like a dead guy
coming right at me.

1049
01:04:14,121 --> 01:04:16,890
[soft growling]

1050
01:04:16,924 --> 01:04:18,158
[Ira] Childs!

1051
01:04:19,126 --> 01:04:20,562
[growls]

1052
01:04:25,432 --> 01:04:26,967
Hey-hey, Childs.

1053
01:04:29,370 --> 01:04:30,404
Rossi!

1054
01:04:30,437 --> 01:04:32,973
C'mon. C'mon, c'mon.
Jimmy, Jimmy!

1055
01:04:33,006 --> 01:04:34,241
[static buzzes]

1056
01:04:35,476 --> 01:04:37,978
[Dash on walkie]
<i>C'mon, c'mon. Come in.</i>

1057
01:04:38,011 --> 01:04:41,048
<i>Rossi. Jimmy.</i>

1058
01:04:42,049 --> 01:04:43,083
<i>Malloy, can you hear...</i>

1059
01:04:44,385 --> 01:04:46,554
<i>Rossi...</i>

1060
01:04:46,588 --> 01:04:48,322
- Dad.
- <i>Jimmy!</i>

1061
01:04:51,659 --> 01:04:53,127
Hello?

1062
01:04:55,162 --> 01:04:58,232
This is crazy, man.

1063
01:04:58,265 --> 01:05:02,269
Clearly we need to find out
what that was, that thing.

1064
01:05:02,302 --> 01:05:03,571
That thing was a man, okay?

1065
01:05:03,605 --> 01:05:06,106
That guy, that-that thing...

1066
01:05:06,140 --> 01:05:09,577
He came in this morning, filed a missing
person's report, and he didn't look like that!

1067
01:05:09,611 --> 01:05:12,112
Guys, my van's in the alley way.
We can go right out the back door.

1068
01:05:12,146 --> 01:05:15,115
We aren't going anywhere until we
figure out and catch that thing

1069
01:05:15,149 --> 01:05:16,518
that's in here with us.
Okay, Detective?

1070
01:05:16,551 --> 01:05:17,652
Alright, we need to
clear the station

1071
01:05:17,685 --> 01:05:18,686
and head down to the morgue.

1072
01:05:18,720 --> 01:05:19,987
We grab my son, grab the others,

1073
01:05:20,020 --> 01:05:21,054
and head out to the alley way.

1074
01:05:21,088 --> 01:05:22,557
Guys, screw the alley way, okay.

1075
01:05:22,590 --> 01:05:24,358
Look at my arm.

1076
01:05:24,391 --> 01:05:28,228
That is acid rain that's coming
down, and it's pouring right now.

1077
01:05:28,262 --> 01:05:30,063
We need to stay here! Okay?

1078
01:05:30,097 --> 01:05:32,166
Catch that thing,
protect the precinct!

1079
01:05:32,199 --> 01:05:34,268
Howie, Howie,
something is godly wrong.

1080
01:05:34,301 --> 01:05:35,637
How'd that guy
turn into that...

1081
01:05:35,670 --> 01:05:39,206
I have no idea, okay.

1082
01:05:39,239 --> 01:05:41,743
The explosion maybe? The rain?

1083
01:05:41,776 --> 01:05:44,044
Okay, okay, okay.

1084
01:05:44,077 --> 01:05:45,979
What's your plan, Sergeant?

1085
01:05:46,013 --> 01:05:49,551
Like I said before,
we clear the station and go get my boy.

1086
01:05:50,652 --> 01:05:52,687
Any luck on the radio?

1087
01:05:52,720 --> 01:05:54,188
Rossi.

1088
01:05:54,221 --> 01:05:56,490
- Rossi.
- Oh, damn, Rossi.

1089
01:05:56,524 --> 01:05:59,527
I... she left a while ago
to get the TV people.

1090
01:05:59,561 --> 01:06:01,094
From the interview.

1091
01:06:01,128 --> 01:06:02,530
- Interview?
- Yes.

1092
01:06:02,564 --> 01:06:04,198
- Gallo?
- Yes!

1093
01:06:04,231 --> 01:06:05,999
Jesus Ch... Really?

1094
01:06:06,033 --> 01:06:08,536
[Howie] We need to get out
of this room, like now.

1095
01:06:08,570 --> 01:06:11,371
At least try to find some place
to go make a call for help.

1096
01:06:11,405 --> 01:06:13,173
Yeah, I'd love
to hear that call.

1097
01:06:13,207 --> 01:06:15,275
Yeah, this is Amityville
station three.

1098
01:06:15,309 --> 01:06:17,512
Yeah, we're under siege
by zombies.

1099
01:06:17,545 --> 01:06:19,446
Yeah, we need help.
I said zombies.

1100
01:06:19,480 --> 01:06:21,616
What the hell, man?
Are you finished, Detective?

1101
01:06:21,649 --> 01:06:24,552
Yes, I am, Lieutenant.
Sorry, this town brings out the best in me.

1102
01:06:24,586 --> 01:06:26,320
[Dash] Alright,
I'm going to get my boy.

1103
01:06:26,353 --> 01:06:29,056
- Dash, wait!
- No, no, don't wait, Howie!

1104
01:06:29,089 --> 01:06:31,492
I'm going to get my son.
He's my responsibility.

1105
01:06:31,526 --> 01:06:34,461
Yes, but what's your plan to go
when you get out there, Dash?

1106
01:06:34,495 --> 01:06:37,464
Okay? I mean,
we don't even know if...

1107
01:06:37,498 --> 01:06:40,602
Really?!
Do not even think like that.

1108
01:06:40,635 --> 01:06:42,369
When's the last time
you talked to him?

1109
01:06:43,738 --> 01:06:45,172
Uh...

1110
01:06:45,205 --> 01:06:46,608
What're you doing here?

1111
01:06:46,641 --> 01:06:49,109
- What happened to her?
- Hey! Do what I asked.

1112
01:06:49,142 --> 01:06:51,044
You don't need to be in here.
Go!

1113
01:06:51,078 --> 01:06:52,346
Dash!

1114
01:06:52,379 --> 01:06:54,516
C'mon, man,
you mean to tell me

1115
01:06:54,549 --> 01:06:57,217
while all this shit's been going
down you haven't checked on your son?

1116
01:06:57,251 --> 01:06:58,620
This shit has
just started going on!

1117
01:06:58,653 --> 01:06:59,754
But that's your son.

1118
01:06:59,787 --> 01:07:02,322
Look, I've been a shit father
his entire life, man.

1119
01:07:02,356 --> 01:07:05,527
I know that. I mean,
that's not how I had it planned.

1120
01:07:05,560 --> 01:07:08,796
I had to get me cleaned up. Had to get me
straight before I'd be responsible for him.

1121
01:07:08,830 --> 01:07:11,633
And I screwed up with him.

1122
01:07:11,666 --> 01:07:13,400
I'm going to get my boy.

1123
01:07:15,302 --> 01:07:17,337
- Stay here, Detective.
- Yeah, the hell I am.

1124
01:07:29,416 --> 01:07:31,351
- Okay.
- Guys ready?

1125
01:07:31,385 --> 01:07:32,620
Yes!

1126
01:07:38,893 --> 01:07:40,695
[gun cocks]

1127
01:07:59,681 --> 01:08:01,181
Yo, Childs.

1128
01:08:02,784 --> 01:08:04,117
Childs.

1129
01:08:05,553 --> 01:08:06,721

1131
01:08:32,580 --> 01:08:34,582

1134
01:09:11,619 --> 01:09:14,589
Jimmy, is Malloy still with you?

1135
01:09:14,622 --> 01:09:15,823
No.

1136
01:09:15,857 --> 01:09:17,190

- [Jimmy indistinct]

1138
01:09:19,694 --> 01:09:20,728
I don't know.

1139
01:09:20,762 --> 01:09:23,631
- Jimmy!
- <i>Dad...</i>

1140
01:09:23,665 --> 01:09:25,700
I hear something outside the door.
Is that you?

1141
01:09:25,733 --> 01:09:26,601
- No, no, no.
- No, Jimmy.

1142
01:09:26,634 --> 01:09:28,502
- Tell him to stay put.
- Jimmy, stay put.

1143
01:09:28,536 --> 01:09:29,570
Stay quiet.

1144
01:09:30,605 --> 01:09:31,906
Dad?

1145
01:09:34,909 --> 01:09:37,277
Jimmy!

1146
01:09:37,310 --> 01:09:39,681
I think it's Dr. Ira.
I'm gonna go peak out the door.

1147
01:09:39,714 --> 01:09:41,816
No! No, tell him
to stay put.

1148
01:09:41,849 --> 01:09:45,953
Jimmy, stay put. Stay quiet.
Do not go in the morgue.

1149
01:09:54,762 --> 01:09:56,898
- <i>Jimmy, stay...</i>

Jimmy!

1153
01:10:11,344 --> 01:10:13,915
- Let's go.
- [mutters] McQueen, let's move.

1154
01:10:22,657 --> 01:10:24,357
Ah, shit.

1155
01:10:25,459 --> 01:10:27,294
There's more blood over here.

1156
01:10:31,899 --> 01:10:34,468
Whose keys and gun is that?

1157
01:10:34,501 --> 01:10:35,636
I'll check.

1158
01:10:42,944 --> 01:10:44,444
[McQueen]
Shoot him in the head.

1159
01:10:47,915 --> 01:10:49,684
Whose damn keys are they?

1160
01:10:54,856 --> 01:10:56,557
That's two that
look like that.

1161
01:10:56,591 --> 01:10:57,558
Rossi's keys.

1162
01:10:57,592 --> 01:10:59,761
Gallo was probably
trying to use her to get out.

1163
01:10:59,794 --> 01:11:01,696
Probably thinking
the same thing we are.

1164
01:11:01,729 --> 01:11:03,430
Down and out
through the morgue.

1165
01:11:03,463 --> 01:11:06,399
This is unfreaking real, man.

1166
01:11:06,433 --> 01:11:08,268
I just killed a dead guy.

1167
01:11:09,771 --> 01:11:11,371
Can anyone hear me on this?

1168
01:11:13,641 --> 01:11:15,576
- Jimmy?
- [Jimmy] <i>Dad?</i>

1169
01:11:15,610 --> 01:11:17,578
- Oh, thank God.
- It's a good thing.

1170
01:11:17,612 --> 01:11:19,346
Hey, let's move.
Let's go, let's go.

- Jimmy.
- Dad.

1174
01:11:55,750 --> 01:11:57,051
Jimmy, I'm coming for you.

1175
01:12:00,755 --> 01:12:03,691
Okay, we got
confirmation, Sergeant.

1176
01:12:03,724 --> 01:12:05,425
Let's go get your boy.

1177
01:12:05,458 --> 01:12:07,394
Come on, guys, let's do this.

Wait, wait, wait....

1184
01:13:09,489 --> 01:13:10,490
What'd you see, LT?

1185
01:13:10,524 --> 01:13:12,560
Can't see shit, but I...

1186
01:13:12,593 --> 01:13:13,761
I hear something.

1187
01:13:14,929 --> 01:13:16,030
It's getting closer.

1193
01:13:42,256 --> 01:13:43,758
Is he dead?

1194
01:13:43,791 --> 01:13:44,926
Yeah.

Yeah, just awesome!

1198
01:14:03,878 --> 01:14:05,546
[Dash]
C'mon, let's go, we gotta move.

1199
01:14:05,579 --> 01:14:07,148
Yeah, just give me a minute,
pard.

1200
01:14:08,816 --> 01:14:09,984
I'll tell you this,

she-she's definitely
not a vegan.

01:14:13,688 --> 01:14:14,755
Come on.

1204
01:14:15,923 --> 01:14:17,024
Let's do it.

1205
01:14:40,881 --> 01:14:42,783
[growling]

1206
01:14:50,658 --> 01:14:51,759
Nice shot, man.

1207
01:14:53,294 --> 01:14:54,996
No, no, no, no, no.

1208
01:14:55,029 --> 01:14:56,063
No, no, no.

1209
01:14:56,731 --> 01:14:57,765
No.

1210
01:14:58,699 --> 01:15:00,301
I just killed Malloy.

1211
01:15:00,334 --> 01:15:03,104
Brother, he-he was already dead.

1212
01:15:04,705 --> 01:15:06,240
What the fuck is going on?

1213
01:15:06,273 --> 01:15:08,642
Hey, hey...

1214
01:15:08,676 --> 01:15:10,578
We need to go
get your boy, okay?

1215
01:15:11,712 --> 01:15:12,747
C'mon, bud.

1216
01:15:17,718 --> 01:15:18,786
Jimmy...

1217
01:15:30,731 --> 01:15:33,034
- Dammit!
- Did you really think that was gonna work?

1218
01:15:33,067 --> 01:15:35,569
No, but the damn
emergency light should be on.

1219
01:15:35,603 --> 01:15:37,171
My batteries are starting
to go out on this.

1220
01:15:37,204 --> 01:15:39,073
Shh, shh,
I can hear something.

1221
01:15:43,644 --> 01:15:45,046
Get on the ground!

1222
01:15:45,079 --> 01:15:46,080
[Dash] Get down!

1223
01:15:46,113 --> 01:15:47,281
Drop the sledgehammer.

1224
01:15:47,314 --> 01:15:49,216
[McQueen]
Get on the ground!

1225
01:15:49,250 --> 01:15:53,120
[laughs] There are zombies
here and you're harassing me?

1226
01:15:53,154 --> 01:15:55,689
I'm innocent,
don't you understand?

1227
01:15:55,723 --> 01:15:57,825
I didn't do it.
I'm not one of them.

1228
01:15:58,392 --> 01:15:59,727
I'm one of you!

1229
01:15:59,760 --> 01:16:01,328
You're not one of us.

1230
01:16:01,362 --> 01:16:03,631
You're a broken part
of the system.

1231
01:16:03,664 --> 01:16:07,201
And you got out while over
a dozen women lost their lives.

1232
01:16:07,234 --> 01:16:08,836
Get the hell out of here.

1233
01:16:09,837 --> 01:16:11,572
But I'm Joe Gallo!

1234
01:16:12,273 --> 01:16:14,942
[screaming]

1235
01:16:31,325 --> 01:16:32,693
Alright.

1236
01:16:34,061 --> 01:16:35,296
Jimmy?

1237
01:16:37,998 --> 01:16:41,335
The door...
we never fixed it.

1238
01:16:41,368 --> 01:16:42,837
[McQueen indistinct]

1239
01:16:42,870 --> 01:16:44,271
He was never safe.

1240
01:16:46,841 --> 01:16:49,143
No! No!

1241
01:16:50,311 --> 01:16:51,779
Oh, my God.

1242
01:16:58,419 --> 01:16:59,920
[yells]

1243
01:17:01,021 --> 01:17:02,756
[sobbing]

1244
01:17:16,871 --> 01:17:18,372
[grunts]

1245
01:17:18,405 --> 01:17:21,075
[McQueen]
Dash, we need to go now!

1246
01:17:23,410 --> 01:17:26,013
Dash, we need
to get out of here!

1247
01:18:03,417 --> 01:18:05,219
[yelling]

1248
01:18:12,860 --> 01:18:14,195
[gunshot]

1249
01:18:19,962 --> 01:18:24,962
