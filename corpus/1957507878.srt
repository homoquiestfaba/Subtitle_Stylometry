00:23:00,715 --> 00:23:02,950
[crying softly]
I'm in serious pain.

544
00:23:02,984 --> 00:23:05,418
She zip tied my hands and feet.

545
00:23:05,452 --> 00:23:07,521
[panting] Come on, man.

546
00:23:07,555 --> 00:23:09,123
You live in Silver Lake.

547
00:23:09,156 --> 00:23:11,424
I will give you money.

548
00:23:11,458 --> 00:23:12,827
[Logan] Are you
fucking with me?

549
00:23:12,860 --> 00:23:16,063
Bro, how long have we
been playing together?

550
00:23:16,097 --> 00:23:18,498
- A year.
- Yeah, that's right.

551
00:23:18,532 --> 00:23:19,166
You know me.

552
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:21,202
[panting]

553
00:23:21,235 --> 00:23:23,104
3282 Franklin, a bungalow.

554
00:23:23,137 --> 00:23:23,971
The back door is open.

555
00:23:24,005 --> 00:23:25,139
Please, man.

556
00:23:25,172 --> 00:23:27,141
I need your help.

557
00:23:27,174 --> 00:23:28,776
[Logan] Why you
puttin' this on me?

558
00:23:28,809 --> 00:23:32,113
[groans] 'Cause
you're all I got, man.

559
00:23:32,146 --> 00:23:35,650
Besides, you're the one
who told me to do Tinder.

560
00:23:35,683 --> 00:23:37,018
I wouldn't have met
that chick, otherwise.

561
00:23:37,051 --> 00:23:40,221
She was a psycho, zip
tied my hands and feet.

562
00:23:40,254 --> 00:23:42,823
It hurts, I gotta take a piss.

563
00:23:42,857 --> 00:23:44,859
I need you come
here and help me!

564
00:23:44,892 --> 00:23:47,161
[Logan] Bro, we play online.

565
00:23:47,194 --> 00:23:48,162
That's it.

566
00:23:48,195 --> 00:23:49,496
I don't know you like that.

567
00:23:49,530 --> 00:23:51,732
I don't wanna physically
meet you and shit.

568
00:23:51,766 --> 00:23:53,801
Remember the
Crystal Tower, huh?

569
00:23:53,834 --> 00:23:55,503
I rescued your ass three times.

570
00:23:55,536 --> 00:23:58,471
Saved your ass three
months of catch-up.

571
00:23:58,506 --> 00:24:00,608
[Logan] [scowls] I knew
you were gonna say that.

572
00:24:00,641 --> 00:24:01,909
I fuckin' knew it.

573
00:24:01,943 --> 00:24:03,511
Please!

574
00:24:03,544 --> 00:24:05,513
3282 Franklin.

575
00:24:05,546 --> 00:24:06,881
Hurry.

576
00:24:06,914 --> 00:24:10,151
I will never ask you
for anything again.

577
00:24:10,184 --> 00:24:11,752
I swear it.

578
00:24:11,786 --> 00:24:13,087
[Logan] Fuck!

579
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:15,589
- Fine!
- Fuck, thank you.

580
00:24:15,623 --> 00:24:17,892
Thank you.
[brief logoff music]

581
00:24:17,925 --> 00:24:19,126
Fuck.

582
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:21,829
[cries softly]

583
00:24:23,197 --> 00:24:25,866
[traffic hums]

584
00:24:38,846 --> 00:24:41,782
[gate creaks shut]

585
00:24:42,883 --> 00:24:46,854
[door creaks open]
In here, man.

586
00:24:46,887 --> 00:24:48,823
What the fuck?

587
00:24:48,856 --> 00:24:51,292
Dude, she zip tied me, bro.

588
00:24:51,325 --> 00:24:52,927
In the kitchen,
there's some clippers.

589
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:54,061
Hurry.

590
00:24:54,095 --> 00:24:55,696
I gotta piss so bad, dude.

591
00:24:55,730 --> 00:24:56,931
All right, all right, all
right, relax, relax, relax.

592
00:24:56,964 --> 00:24:59,667
Oh, I'm in agony!
[silverware clatters]

593
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:00,568
Hurry!

594
00:25:02,169 --> 00:25:05,139
[straining] Oh, thank you, bro.

595
00:25:05,172 --> 00:25:06,841
[grunting] What the fuck?

596
00:25:06,874 --> 00:25:08,109
[exhales loudly]

597
00:25:08,142 --> 00:25:10,211
Thank you, man, you saved me.

598
00:25:10,244 --> 00:25:11,979
[grunts loudly]

599
00:25:12,013 --> 00:25:16,817
Uh, okay, yeah, I'm
officially freaked the fuck out.

600
00:25:16,851 --> 00:25:18,819
[urine trickling distantly]

601
00:25:18,853 --> 00:25:20,888
[Sid] Dude,
thank God you came.

602
00:25:20,921 --> 00:25:23,090
I thought I was gonna die.

603
00:25:24,592 --> 00:25:25,926
What the hell?

604
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:27,128
You're not 20.

605
00:25:27,161 --> 00:25:28,829
You are an old motherfucker!

606
00:25:28,863 --> 00:25:30,231
What are you, 50?

607
00:25:30,264 --> 00:25:33,200
[groans] No, man,
I just turned 40.

608
00:25:33,234 --> 00:25:35,069
[Sid moans]

609
00:25:35,102 --> 00:25:37,071
- [toilet flushes]
- You're a liar.

610
00:25:37,104 --> 00:25:38,105
What's your game?

611
00:25:38,139 --> 00:25:39,974
- Huh, you catfishing?
- No.

612
00:25:40,007 --> 00:25:40,975
You trying to trick me?

613
00:25:41,008 --> 00:25:41,876
No.

614
00:25:44,745 --> 00:25:46,647
I feel really bad, bro.

615
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:47,748
Let me make it up to you,

616
00:25:47,782 --> 00:25:48,983
'cause I got smoke.

617
00:25:49,016 --> 00:25:50,584
Yeah, I don't know, man.

618
00:25:50,618 --> 00:25:51,752
I gotta get going.

619
00:25:51,786 --> 00:25:52,953
Oh, come on, man,
just one smoke.

620
00:25:52,987 --> 00:25:55,089
Come on, sit down, sit
down, please, sit down.

621
00:25:55,122 --> 00:25:56,724
- All right, one smoke.
- Thank you, bro.

622
00:25:56,757 --> 00:26:00,694
Hey, give me just one
second, I need to change.

623
00:26:01,796 --> 00:26:03,330
- Yeah.
- Damn, man.

624
00:26:03,364 --> 00:26:04,598
This is embarrassing.

625
00:26:04,632 --> 00:26:06,233
Yeah, no, no problem.

626
00:26:06,267 --> 00:26:08,602
[Sid] I thought she
was gonna eat me, man.

627
00:26:08,636 --> 00:26:09,804
Eat you, huh?

628
00:26:09,837 --> 00:26:13,207
[exhales loudly]
I'm still hurtin'.

629
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:15,576
[panting]

630
00:26:16,744 --> 00:26:17,611
Whew.

631
00:26:19,914 --> 00:26:23,684
Shit was starin' straight
into my eyeballs all day.

632
00:26:23,717 --> 00:26:25,853
That was the real torture.

633
00:26:27,354 --> 00:26:30,191
[lighter clicks]

634
00:26:33,260 --> 00:26:34,628
[groans]

635
00:26:34,662 --> 00:26:38,899
[inhales sharply]
Oh, it's so good.

636
00:26:38,933 --> 00:26:41,202
Careful, this shit's strong.

637
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:48,042
[coughing]

638
00:26:48,075 --> 00:26:49,343
- Told you.
- Shit.

639
00:26:50,678 --> 00:26:52,346
So, what's wrong with you, bro?

640
00:26:52,379 --> 00:26:54,715
Why you have some stranger
danger come tie you up?

641
00:26:54,748 --> 00:26:57,318
Man, that shit just
happened so fast,

642
00:26:57,351 --> 00:26:58,819
and I was into it.

643
00:26:58,853 --> 00:27:00,821
She jumped me, and
everything was cool,

644
00:27:00,855 --> 00:27:02,189
and then, boo ya.

645
00:27:02,223 --> 00:27:03,858
Psycho kamikaze.

646
00:27:03,891 --> 00:27:07,194
[exhales sharply]
So, uh, what?

647
00:27:07,228 --> 00:27:09,096
Just you live here?

648
00:27:09,130 --> 00:27:11,198
Yeah, kind of a hermit.

649
00:27:11,232 --> 00:27:13,300
I like it simple.

650
00:27:13,334 --> 00:27:15,336
Man, the lights are dope.

651
00:27:15,369 --> 00:27:16,737
Full emergent, bro.

652
00:27:16,770 --> 00:27:18,205
Perpetual night.

653
00:27:18,239 --> 00:27:20,841
Check it out, even comes
with mood lighting.

654
00:27:20,875 --> 00:27:22,943
Click on the blue square.

655
00:27:22,977 --> 00:27:24,078
[deep bass note plays]

656
00:27:24,111 --> 00:27:26,647
- Pretty dope, huh?
- Ah, tight.

657
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:33,888
I got fucked.

658
00:27:35,122 --> 00:27:37,958
My job was taken by a robot.

659
00:27:37,992 --> 00:27:40,828
Rendered useless by machines.

660
00:27:40,861 --> 00:27:42,096
Hit me hard a couple years ago,

661
00:27:42,129 --> 00:27:44,198
and that's when I
stuck to gaming.

662
00:27:44,231 --> 00:27:46,167
So, a robot took your job?

663
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:47,935
Pfft, that's fucked.

664
00:27:49,103 --> 00:27:51,338
Why do you think
I'm called Challenger?

665
00:27:51,372 --> 00:27:54,041
'Cause I never win at anything.

666
00:27:54,074 --> 00:27:56,010
I've never beaten you in a game.

667
00:27:56,043 --> 00:27:57,211
Yeah, that's right.

668
00:27:57,244 --> 00:27:58,112
Never.

669
00:27:59,747 --> 00:28:02,149
That's why I lied
about my age, man.

670
00:28:02,183 --> 00:28:05,219
Look, I don't blame
you for being mad.

671
00:28:05,252 --> 00:28:06,253
I'm a loser.

672
00:28:07,421 --> 00:28:10,724
[scoffs] Nah, nah.

673
00:28:11,892 --> 00:28:13,727
[inhales sharply]
You're funny, bro.

674
00:28:13,761 --> 00:28:15,329
You're all right.

675
00:28:15,362 --> 00:28:17,097
I just need to start winning.

676
00:28:17,131 --> 00:28:18,132
[Logan] Yeah, you
just need a little bit

677
00:28:18,165 --> 00:28:20,000
- of luck, that's all.
- Right?

678
00:28:20,034 --> 00:28:21,969
Hey, I noticed these.

679
00:28:23,938 --> 00:28:25,507
You buy all these
lottery tickets?

680
00:28:25,540 --> 00:28:26,373
[Sid] Yep.

681
00:28:26,407 --> 00:28:27,942
Five years worth.

682
00:28:29,310 --> 00:28:32,012
I mean, you can't win the
lotto without luck, right?

683
00:28:32,046 --> 00:28:34,915
That's what separates the
winners from the losers.

684
00:28:34,949 --> 00:28:37,818
[inhales sharply] You know,
I've never had much luck.

685
00:28:37,851 --> 00:28:40,387
[Logan] Well, then,
that's the issue.

686
00:28:40,421 --> 00:28:41,322
Oh, yeah?

687
00:28:43,390 --> 00:28:45,259
Where do I find luck?

688
00:28:45,292 --> 00:28:47,995
Around the corner,
perseverance, and opportunity.

689
00:28:48,028 --> 00:28:51,265
Mm, [inhales sharply] at
least that's what my mom said.

690
00:28:51,298 --> 00:28:54,168
Perseverance and
opportunity, I like that.

691
00:28:54,201 --> 00:28:55,369
Yeah.

692
00:28:55,402 --> 00:28:58,405
I mean, find luck, and
you'll be laughing.

693
00:28:58,439 --> 00:29:00,441
I used to laugh a lot.

694
00:29:02,376 --> 00:29:05,079
Honestly, bro,
I am high as hell.

695
00:29:05,112 --> 00:29:06,146
I gotta split.

696
00:29:06,180 --> 00:29:07,314
Ladies to see.

697
00:29:08,182 --> 00:29:11,318
[exhales loudly]

698
00:29:11,352 --> 00:29:13,087
Thanks for helping.

699
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:15,122
You saved my life.

700
00:29:15,155 --> 00:29:16,023
Bros?

701
00:29:17,891 --> 00:29:19,293
Take care, man.

702
00:29:19,326 --> 00:29:21,795
And listen, don't let no
more crazy bitches up here.

703
00:29:21,829 --> 00:29:23,063
All right?

704
00:29:23,097 --> 00:29:24,231
I think I'm gonna
delete the app.

705
00:29:24,265 --> 00:29:25,966
Yeah, you should.

706
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:29,970
Hey, uh, you get that
good shit on the regular?

707
00:29:30,004 --> 00:29:32,206
- Any time you want.
- Yeah?

708
00:29:33,173 --> 00:29:34,875
Let's swap contact info.

709
00:29:34,908 --> 00:29:36,443
- You got it.
- Yeah.

710
00:29:38,178 --> 00:29:40,347
- Sid Smith.
- Yeah.

711
00:29:40,381 --> 00:29:42,182
I'm gonna keep
you as Challenger.

712
00:29:42,216 --> 00:29:44,418
- Call me whatever you want.
- Yeah.

713
00:29:44,451 --> 00:29:45,919
Logan Gibson.

714
00:29:45,953 --> 00:29:47,288
Nice to meet you.
[phone chimes]

715
00:29:47,321 --> 00:29:49,557
Hey, you have some
good shit, by the way.

716
00:29:49,591 --> 00:29:50,824
Keep it.

717
00:29:50,858 --> 00:29:51,492
Take it with you.

718
00:29:51,526 --> 00:29:52,993
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

719
00:29:53,027 --> 00:29:55,829
I can fuck with that, thanks.

720
00:29:55,863 --> 00:29:57,599
Go find that luck, man.

721

00:40:01,468 --> 00:40:02,803
- Logan is right through here.
- All right.

901
00:40:02,837 --> 00:40:05,006
- Okay?
- Awesome wall paper.

902
00:40:05,039 --> 00:40:06,040
Ah, Logan?

903
00:40:08,475 --> 00:40:11,512
[coughs abruptly]

904
00:40:11,545 --> 00:40:13,014
Logan, what's up?

905
00:40:15,182 --> 00:40:17,118
You've never introduced
me to Sid before, Son.

906
00:40:17,151 --> 00:40:18,719
Yeah.

907
00:40:18,753 --> 00:40:20,154
[chuckles sarcastically]
What are you doing here?

908
00:40:20,187 --> 00:40:23,456
I have some amazing news,
man, I have to tell you.

909
00:40:23,490 --> 00:40:26,527
- Okay, um-
- I'd like to hear it.

910
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:27,728
All right, Logan was just-

911
00:40:27,762 --> 00:40:29,030
- No, no, no, no,
no, no, no, outside.

912
00:40:29,063 --> 00:40:31,732
Whoa, you didn't even
finish your breakfast.

913
00:40:31,766 --> 00:40:33,466
Oh, yeah, uh, I'll
finish it outside.

914
00:40:33,500 --> 00:40:34,735
Mom, it's delicious, thank you.

915
00:40:34,769 --> 00:40:36,904
10 minutes, five minutes.

916
00:40:36,938 --> 00:40:38,471
30 seconds, two
seconds, let's go.

917
00:40:38,506 --> 00:40:39,140
- Outside.
- Nice meet you.

918
00:40:39,173 --> 00:40:40,007
No, yep, thanks so much.

919
00:40:40,041 --> 00:40:41,208
Thanks.

920
00:40:41,242 --> 00:40:42,009
Thanks, Mom.

921
00:40:43,577 --> 00:40:45,079
What the fuck are
you doing here?

922
00:40:45,112 --> 00:40:46,681
I have to tell you something.

923
00:40:46,714 --> 00:40:48,082
You will not believe it.

924
00:40:48,115 --> 00:40:49,750
Did I invite you here?

925
00:40:49,784 --> 00:40:53,486
Well, no, I was
just stoppin' by.

926
00:40:53,521 --> 00:40:54,522
You forgot to mention
the part about living

927
00:40:54,555 --> 00:40:55,656
with your mom, by the way.

928
00:40:55,690 --> 00:40:56,891
[sighs]

929
00:40:56,924 --> 00:40:58,559
Guess that makes us
even on the bullshit.

930
00:40:58,592 --> 00:41:00,928
We play video games
online together.

931
00:41:00,962 --> 00:41:02,263
We are not friends.

932
00:41:02,296 --> 00:41:03,597
I helped you out last night

933
00:41:03,631 --> 00:41:04,966
because I felt
sorry for you, man.

934
00:41:04,999 --> 00:41:06,634
I don't need a
friend in real life.

935
00:41:06,667 --> 00:41:08,069
Can I just tell
you why I came?

936
00:41:08,102 --> 00:41:09,770
- Bro.
- It's important.

937
00:41:09,804 --> 00:41:11,238
It was your idea.

938
00:41:11,272 --> 00:41:12,606
Okay.

939
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:13,774
You said I had to
find my own luck, right?

940
00:41:13,808 --> 00:41:15,009
Yes.

941
00:41:15,042 --> 00:41:16,711
Well, I found it.

942
00:41:16,744 --> 00:41:18,045
[upbeat electronic music]
Look.

943
00:41:18,079 --> 00:41:20,114
People in Russia are
burying themselves

944
00:41:20,147 --> 00:41:22,183
for 24-hours, for luck.

945
00:41:22,216 --> 00:41:24,552
It's a 24-hour
supervised self-burial,

946
00:41:24,585 --> 00:41:25,953
and it works, bro.

947
00:41:25,987 --> 00:41:27,555
People are gettin'
all kinds of lucky,

948
00:41:27,588 --> 00:41:29,857
gettin' jobs, finding money,
girls, all kinds of shit.

949
00:41:29,890 --> 00:41:30,758
Shh!

950
00:41:31,692 --> 00:41:32,827
Okay, and?

951
00:41:32,860 --> 00:41:35,062
And, and I'm gonna do it.

952
00:41:36,197 --> 00:41:37,898
I'm gonna bury
myself for 24 hours,

953
00:41:37,932 --> 00:41:40,601
and that's how I'm
gonna find my luck.

954
00:41:40,634 --> 00:41:42,937
It worked for all those
people in the video.

955
00:41:42,970 --> 00:41:45,139
- You're crazy.
- I'm serious.

956
00:41:45,172 --> 00:41:47,208
And I want you to supervise it.

957
00:41:47,241 --> 00:41:50,544
You're gonna bury yourself
in a box for 24 hours,

958
00:41:50,578 --> 00:41:52,546
because you think it's
gonna bring you luck?

959
00:41:52,580 --> 00:41:53,647
Do you hear yourself, man?

960
00:41:53,681 --> 00:41:54,315
It's a hoax.

961
00:41:54,348 --> 00:41:55,216
Look at the videos.

962
00:41:55,249 --> 00:41:56,584
It works.

963
00:41:56,617 --> 00:41:57,551
Okay, that's it.

964
00:41:57,585 --> 00:41:58,552
You gotta go, okay?

965
00:41:58,586 --> 00:42:00,221
Get your shit and let's go.

966
00:42:00,254 --> 00:42:01,088
Come on.

967
00:42:02,123 --> 00:42:03,624
Go, go.

968
00:42:03,657 --> 00:42:04,625
[phone chimes]

969
00:42:04,658 --> 00:42:06,027
Here, I sent you the
video, just watch it.

970
00:42:06,060 --> 00:42:06,961
- That's all I ask.
- I'll watch it,

971
00:42:06,994 --> 00:42:08,062
I'll watch it, please, just go.

972
00:42:08,095 --> 00:42:10,297
You can't show up here
unannounced, man, it's not cool.

973
00:42:10,331 --> 00:42:11,832
Dude, you always invite me.

974
00:42:11,866 --> 00:42:12,967
Okay, all right, all
right, I get it, go, please.

975
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,568
- Jeez, okay.
- Jesus Christ.

976
00:42:14,602 --> 00:42:16,003
- Just watch the video.
- Okay.

977
00:42:16,037 --> 00:42:17,238
Okay.

978
00:42:17,271 --> 00:42:21,308
Thank you.
[imitates explosion]

979
00:42:22,676 --> 00:42:24,645
Hey, going so quick?

980
00:42:24,678 --> 00:42:28,582
Yeah, sorry for dropping
by unannounced, my bad.

981
00:42:28,616 --> 00:42:30,918
Oh, no, come by any time.

982
00:42:30,951 --> 00:42:32,319
Logan needs friends.

983
00:42:32,353 --> 00:42:35,356
He's always up in that room
playing those video games.

984
00:42:35,389 --> 00:42:37,124
Yeah, with me, sadly.

985
00:42:37,158 --> 00:42:38,292
Guilty culprit.

986
00:42:38,325 --> 00:42:40,928
Ah, well, at
least you're honest.

987
00:42:40,961 --> 00:42:41,962
I like that.

988
00:42:43,631 --> 00:42:45,266
Thanks, Ms. Gibson.

989
00:42:45,299 --> 00:42:46,734
Make it Diane.

990
00:42:47,902 --> 00:42:49,270
Diane.

991
00:42:49,303 --> 00:42:51,806
- Thanks, Diane.
- Take care, Sid.

992
00:42:51,839 --> 00:42:52,673
Ride safe.

993
00:43:10,424 --> 00:43:11,992
- How's it goin'?
- Hey.

994
00:43:12,026 --> 00:43:13,027
Returning.

995
00:43:14,328 --> 00:43:15,863
All right, Sid,
you can go back.

996
00:43:15,896 --> 00:43:16,831
Thank you.

997
00:43:16,864 --> 00:43:19,834
[faint hip hop music]

998
00:43:19,867 --> 00:43:21,302
Hey, Sid, how you doin'?

999
00:43:21,335 --> 00:43:23,070
V, my favorite bud-tender.

1000
00:43:23,104 --> 00:43:24,738
You shaved your head, huh?

1001
00:43:24,772 --> 00:43:26,907
Oh, yeah, I needed a change.

1002
00:43:26,941 --> 00:43:29,677
[electric razor buzzing]

1003
00:43:29,710 --> 00:43:31,679
It was weird, check it out.

1004
00:43:31,712 --> 00:43:32,346
It does feel weird.

1005
00:43:32,379 --> 00:43:33,247
It looks good, though.

1006
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:34,281
- You think so?
- Yeah.

1007
00:43:34,315 --> 00:43:36,050
Oh, thanks.

1008
00:43:36,083 --> 00:43:37,918
Um, 30 grams of
the usual, please.

1009
00:43:37,952 --> 00:43:39,320
The usual? All right.

1010
00:43:39,353 --> 00:43:41,755
Um, this new batch is
a lot stronger, okay?

1011
00:43:41,789 --> 00:43:42,990
So you gotta be careful.

1012
00:43:43,023 --> 00:43:44,091
You know me well.

1013
00:43:44,125 --> 00:43:45,326
The stronger, the better.

1014
00:43:45,359 --> 00:43:47,194
I prefer to be comfortably numb.

1015
00:43:47,228 --> 00:43:48,896
Yeah, well, that'll
cheer you up for sure.

1016
00:43:48,929 --> 00:43:51,799
Oh, my God, that's
beautiful, look at that.

1017
00:43:51,832 --> 00:43:53,200
Oh, my God, yes, please.

1018
00:43:53,234 --> 00:43:54,902
[V] [laughs] It's good, right?

1019
00:43:54,935 --> 00:43:57,171
- Yes, I'll take this, please.
- Okay.

1020
00:43:57,204 --> 00:43:59,807
My friends are
gonna love this.

1021
00:43:59,840 --> 00:44:01,142
It's always best
when it's shared.

1022
00:44:01,175 --> 00:44:02,009
That's sweet.

1023
00:44:02,042 --> 00:44:02,877
Good guy.

- That's for the Kush.
- Thank you.

- This is for you.
- Thanks.

Yeah, it matches your eyes.

- Really nice.
- Thanks.

What happened to
us going to coffee?

Oh, my God, that
totally slipped my mind.

I'm so sorry.

get some coffee with you.

is the second time,

1041

so don't lose this.

What's up?

The last time I saw eyes

1072
00:48:08,723 --> 00:48:11,693
that red was Bram
Stoker's Dracula.

Very funny.

00:48:23,971 --> 00:48:25,939
You can always buy somethin'.

1079
00:48:25,973 --> 00:48:27,107
We're broke.

1080
00:48:27,141 --> 00:48:30,344
Can we just get a couple
grams and square up tomorrow?

1081
00:48:30,377 --> 00:48:32,946
No fronts, ladies, sorry.

1082
00:48:32,980 --> 00:48:36,116
Please, we'll be
really nice to you.

1083
00:48:37,619 --> 00:48:38,952
You girls are teenagers.

1084
00:48:38,986 --> 00:48:40,722
What do I look like,
Captain Creepy?

1085
00:48:40,755 --> 00:48:42,289
Just one joint.

1086
00:48:44,258 --> 00:48:45,159
Just come back later

1087
00:48:45,192 --> 00:48:48,328
when you guys get
some cash, all right?

1088
00:48:51,331 --> 00:48:52,634
[door thuds]

1089
00:48:52,667 --> 00:48:54,001
[Both] Loser.

1090
00:48:54,034 --> 00:48:56,136
- I heard that!
- Good.

1091
00:48:56,170 --> 00:48:58,138
- What the fuck?
- I know.

1092
00:49:09,784 --> 00:49:13,987
Big, huge.

00:49:20,728 --> 00:49:23,531
[Girl On Video]
Watch me twerk.

1096
00:49:25,432 --> 00:49:28,235
I told you no freebies!

1097
00:49:28,268 --> 00:49:29,136
Uh, sorry.

1098
00:49:31,171 --> 00:49:32,139
Thought you were somebody else.

1099
00:49:32,172 --> 00:49:35,577
My name is Joan, and
this is my son, David.

1100
00:49:35,610 --> 00:49:37,077
How are you today?

1101
00:49:37,110 --> 00:49:38,212
I'm Sid.

1102
00:49:38,245 --> 00:49:39,647
- Good, thanks.
- Hello, Sid.

1103
00:49:39,681 --> 00:49:41,448
We're visiting new friends
in our neighborhood today,

1104
00:49:41,482 --> 00:49:43,551
spreading the word
of our good Lord.

1105
00:49:43,585 --> 00:49:46,286
Our goal is to save as
many souls as possible

1106
00:49:46,320 --> 00:49:49,356
from the inevitable
upcoming disaster.

1107
00:49:49,389 --> 00:49:51,593
- Disaster?
- Armageddon.

1108
00:49:51,626 --> 00:49:54,061
As written, it's not
a question of if,

1109
00:49:54,094 --> 00:49:55,730
more a question of when.

1110
00:49:55,763 --> 00:49:57,599
You see the signs on the news,

1111
00:49:57,632 --> 00:50:02,035
global war, nuclear threats
from foreign dictators.

1112
00:50:02,069 --> 00:50:05,640
It's a matter of time, Mr.
Smith, or can I call you Sid?

1113
00:50:05,673 --> 00:50:07,575
No, Sid's fine.

1114
00:50:07,609 --> 00:50:09,409
That's pretty dark.

1115
00:50:09,443 --> 00:50:10,612
Well, that's why we're here,

1116
00:50:10,645 --> 00:50:13,046
to offer you a way
out of the darkness.

1117
00:50:13,080 --> 00:50:14,114
Uh...

1118
00:50:14,147 --> 00:50:15,583
I'm not in the dark.

1119
00:50:15,617 --> 00:50:17,084
We all are.

1120
00:50:17,117 --> 00:50:18,318
I read the Bible.

1121
00:50:18,352 --> 00:50:20,588
- So, you're a Christian?
- Agnostic.

1122
00:50:20,622 --> 00:50:22,222
[speaks in foreign language]

1123
00:50:22,256 --> 00:50:24,157
I can clear that.

1124
00:50:24,191 --> 00:50:28,061
So, you're open to the
possibility of God.

1125
00:50:28,095 --> 00:50:32,199
Well, anything's possible,
but I prefer science.

1126
00:50:32,232 --> 00:50:33,200
It's real, you know?

1127
00:50:33,233 --> 00:50:35,302
Graspable, tangible.

1128
00:50:35,335 --> 00:50:37,471
No god has ever done
anything for me.

1129
00:50:37,505 --> 00:50:39,339
It's so hot.

1130
00:50:39,373 --> 00:50:41,341
I'm very sensitive to the heat.

1131
00:50:41,375 --> 00:50:43,210
May we continue inside?

1132
00:50:43,243 --> 00:50:44,077
Uh...

1133
00:50:45,279 --> 00:50:46,548
My place is a mess.

1134
00:50:46,581 --> 00:50:48,215
No judgment here.

1135
00:50:50,818 --> 00:50:52,286
Sure, why not?

1136
00:50:52,319 --> 00:50:56,123
Come on in.
[faint R&B music]

1137
00:50:57,291 --> 00:51:00,427
Please, have a seat,
sit down, sit down.

1138
00:51:02,664 --> 00:51:03,831
[Girl On Video] Do
you like my big ass?

1139
00:51:03,865 --> 00:51:05,633
[laptop thuds shut]

1140
00:51:05,667 --> 00:51:07,134
Uh, my portal.

1141
00:51:10,203 --> 00:51:12,507
[bells dinging]

1142
00:51:12,540 --> 00:51:15,275
Hey, what if an alien came down?

1143
00:51:16,410 --> 00:51:18,378
For everyone to see,
in broad daylight?

1144
00:51:18,412 --> 00:51:20,314
Would that disprove
the existence of God?

1145
00:51:20,347 --> 00:51:22,149
Well, that's not gonna happen.

1146
00:51:22,182 --> 00:51:23,317
Really?

1147
00:51:23,350 --> 00:51:24,619
How do you know?

1148
00:51:25,820 --> 00:51:28,322
That's science fiction, Sid.

1149
00:51:28,355 --> 00:51:33,126
Outside, you said that God's
never done anything for you.

1150
00:51:33,160 --> 00:51:35,162
You know that you have
to ask Him for help

1151
00:51:35,195 --> 00:51:37,197
for Him to answer the call?

1152
00:51:37,230 --> 00:51:40,702
Yeah, but God only
saves you when you die,

1153
00:51:40,735 --> 00:51:43,538
and none us knows what
happens when we die.

1154
00:51:43,571 --> 00:51:45,339
God knows.

1155
00:51:45,372 --> 00:51:50,143
[scoffs] See, you gotta believe
to get in the after party.

1156
00:51:50,177 --> 00:51:53,781
To me, why can't the
planet, the solar system,

1157
00:51:53,815 --> 00:51:55,683
the universe, be God?

1158
00:51:55,717 --> 00:51:56,751
God is everything.

1159
00:51:56,784 --> 00:51:59,353
He is in everything.

1160
00:51:59,386 --> 00:52:03,524
Hm, God, good, devil,
evil, isn't it that simple?

1161
00:52:04,892 --> 00:52:07,461
Believe in something greater,
conquer our fear of death,

1162
00:52:07,494 --> 00:52:09,564
and add meaningfulness
to the void?

1163
00:52:09,597 --> 00:52:10,832
[dramatic music]

1164
00:52:10,865 --> 00:52:13,668
Aren't we God,
the makers of man?

1165
00:52:15,837 --> 00:52:17,437
[door knocking]

1166
00:52:17,471 --> 00:52:18,472
I'll get it.

1167
00:52:20,374 --> 00:52:21,509
It was nice talking with you.

1168
00:52:21,542 --> 00:52:22,577
We'll meet again later.

1169
00:52:22,610 --> 00:52:23,578
Inspiring stuff.

1170
00:52:23,611 --> 00:52:24,444
Holy shit.

1171
00:52:24,478 --> 00:52:25,913
It's my friend, Logan.

1172
00:52:25,947 --> 00:52:27,849
Nice talkin' to you.

1173
00:52:27,882 --> 00:52:29,951
Nice talkin' to you.

1174
00:52:29,984 --> 00:52:32,219
- Who were they?
- I don't know.

1175
00:52:32,252 --> 00:52:33,721
Some church.

1176
00:52:33,755 --> 00:52:36,758
- And you let them in?
- Yeah, just for a minute.

1177
00:52:36,791 --> 00:52:37,792
You got problems.

1178
00:52:37,825 --> 00:52:39,794
Can I get a joint, please?

1179
00:52:39,827 --> 00:52:42,897
For you, I'm gonna
get a fresh one.

1180
00:52:48,903 --> 00:52:49,771
One J.

1181
00:52:50,805 --> 00:52:52,406
Your idea, bro.

1182
00:52:52,439 --> 00:52:53,875
Pretty brilliant.

1183
00:52:53,908 --> 00:52:55,342
Oh, what idea?

1184
00:52:56,944 --> 00:52:59,279
The 24-hour supervised
self-burial challenge.

1185
00:52:59,312 --> 00:53:00,882
Oh, yeah, right.

1186
00:53:00,915 --> 00:53:02,482
I told you.

1187
00:53:02,517 --> 00:53:03,483
Did you watch the videos?

1188
00:53:03,518 --> 00:53:05,787
Yes, I watched the videos.

1189
00:53:07,320 --> 00:53:08,756
Do you think it'll work?

1190
00:53:08,790 --> 00:53:11,893
Yo, you don't even need luck
for this shit to work, man.

1191
00:53:11,926 --> 00:53:13,427
What do you mean?

1192
00:53:13,460 --> 00:53:17,330
That's the whole point
of doing it, for luck.

1193
00:53:17,364 --> 00:53:19,433
Sid, listen to me.

1194
00:53:19,466 --> 00:53:22,235
Those Russian videos, they
have millions of views.

1195
00:53:22,269 --> 00:53:24,237
Some have 10s of millions.

1196
00:53:24,271 --> 00:53:25,439
Do you know what kind of money

1197
00:53:25,472 --> 00:53:27,975
we can make with
those views, man?

1198
00:53:29,811 --> 00:53:30,678
No.

1199
00:53:31,779 --> 00:53:34,314
10s of thousands, okay?

1200
00:53:34,347 --> 00:53:36,349
Nobody in the states has
made a self-burial video.

1201
00:53:36,383 --> 00:53:37,819
We can be the first.

1202
00:53:37,852 --> 00:53:39,921
I mean, do you know
what this means?

1203
00:53:39,954 --> 00:53:42,255
If this shit goes viral, man.

1204
00:53:42,289 --> 00:53:43,725
Damn.

1205
00:53:43,758 --> 00:53:47,929
- Even if I don't get lucky-
- We just got lucky.

1206
00:53:47,962 --> 00:53:50,898
- We?
- Yes, I'm in, bro, 110%.

1207
00:53:52,600 --> 00:53:53,968
I'm gonna help you
make the video.

1208
00:53:54,001 --> 00:53:56,436
We can even livestream it
to my Facebook and YouTube.

1209
00:53:56,470 --> 00:53:58,740
It's set up with tons
of followers, man.

1210
00:53:58,773 --> 00:53:59,774
You have followers?

1211
00:53:59,807 --> 00:54:00,842
Over 1,000.

1212
00:54:01,843 --> 00:54:02,710
Damn.

1213
00:54:03,778 --> 00:54:06,013
Sid, this is huge.

1214
00:54:06,047 --> 00:54:08,549
This can bring us
millions of followers,

1215
00:54:08,583 --> 00:54:11,485
and millions of
new opportunities.

1216
00:54:11,519 --> 00:54:14,555
Okay, what do we have to do?

1217
00:54:14,589 --> 00:54:16,991
Well, first, we shake on it.

1218
00:54:17,892 --> 00:54:21,428
50/50 on all the monies made.

1219
00:54:21,461 --> 00:54:24,966
[scoffs] 50/50?

1220
00:54:24,999 --> 00:54:27,969
I'm the one going in the box.

1221
00:54:28,002 --> 00:54:29,537
- [dramatic music]
- Relax.

1222
00:54:29,570 --> 00:54:31,906
It's my gear, my channel.

1223
00:54:31,939 --> 00:54:35,543
You wanna do it on
your own, unsupervised?

1224
00:54:38,378 --> 00:54:40,648
All right, then
you have to supervise

1225
00:54:40,681 --> 00:54:43,785
the entire thing, all 24 hours.

1226
00:54:43,818 --> 00:54:45,720
You can't leave me
down there alone.

1227
00:54:45,753 --> 00:54:46,621
I won't.

1228
00:54:47,822 --> 00:54:51,358
And I can't go into
that box not knowing

1229
00:54:51,391 --> 00:54:54,394
if I'm gonna be
homeless when I get out.

1230
00:54:54,427 --> 00:54:56,831
If this goes wrong,
and I get evicted,

1231
00:54:56,864 --> 00:54:59,734
I need somewhere to go,
man, for like a month,

1232
00:54:59,767 --> 00:55:01,969
until I can find another place.

1233
00:55:02,003 --> 00:55:03,538
Like your pad.

1234
00:55:03,571 --> 00:55:05,873
You have gotta be kidding me.

1235
00:55:05,907 --> 00:55:08,109
[voice breaking] I can't
do it otherwise, man.

1236
00:55:08,142 --> 00:55:10,611
[panting] I'll die of stress.

1237
00:55:10,645 --> 00:55:13,446
Okay, okay, all right,
don't die of stress.

1238
00:55:13,480 --> 00:55:15,516
I'll talk to my mom.

1239
00:55:15,550 --> 00:55:17,018
Your mom likes me.

1240
00:55:17,051 --> 00:55:19,620
Hey, watch it, okay?

1241
00:55:19,654 --> 00:55:21,022
I'll talk to her.

1242
00:55:21,055 --> 00:55:24,424
This means a lot to me, man.

1243
00:55:24,457 --> 00:55:25,827
It really means a lot to me.

1244
00:55:25,860 --> 00:55:26,828
I got you.

1245
00:55:26,861 --> 00:55:30,765
We gotta dig a hole and
build a box, all right?

1246
00:55:30,798 --> 00:55:34,969
I'll come back tomorrow,
and we'll get started.

1247
00:55:35,002 --> 00:55:36,537
I can't believe
we're doin' it.

1248
00:55:36,571 --> 00:55:39,974
[chuckles] I got you, man.

1249
00:55:40,007 --> 00:55:44,477
- I'll see you tomorrow, okay?
- I'll see you tomorrow.

1250

No, I feel you, man.

1258
00:56:00,061 --> 00:56:00,995
We shouldn't do a coffin.

- That's just-
- It's like, feet are tied up,

gotta get a pipe,

drill a hole, and stick it in
the top, so you can breath.

forgot about that.

You will run out

not have that happen.

really wanna die, man.

I don't want you
to die, either.

So, do you know where
we can get a pipe from?

1269
00:56:21,716 --> 00:56:23,684
I have a couple
pipes in the back.

Where'd you go?

1608
01:13:06,453 --> 01:13:08,455
Did you disappear on me?

Dude, you totally
disappeared on me.

No, man, look, I would
never leave, all right?

1619
01:13:29,877 --> 01:13:32,013

Um, how'd you get my number?

Um, it's on file
here at the store,

1660
01:15:52,653 --> 01:15:54,989
and I got kinda worried
that you lost my card again.

1661
01:15:55,022 --> 01:15:58,225
[Sid] Oh, no, no, I had
your card, I was gonna call.

Mm hm, sure you were.

kind of in the middle of
a challenge right now.

1667
01:16:09,136 --> 01:16:10,137
A challenge?

1668
01:16:10,171 --> 01:16:12,840
Yeah, I'm buried underground,

1669
01:16:12,873 --> 01:16:15,743
doing a supervised
self-burial for good luck.

1670
01:16:15,776 --> 01:16:18,345
Wait a minute, you're
buried underground right now?

1671
01:16:18,379 --> 01:16:20,614

I'm really glad you called.

Ditto.

I knew this
challenge would work,

1680
01:16:35,896 --> 01:16:38,666

called just proves it.

very sweet, Sid.

All right, well, be careful?

Keep getting lucky, and
call me later, yeah?

just proved it.

You're meant to be
supervising me, man.

What do you mean, we're rich?

This isn't real.

Yes, it is, Ma.

Well, uh, I bought it.

Logan, you don't
buy lottery tickets.

Okay, Ma, Sid bought it.

Momma, you know I
wouldn't steal, okay?

1778
01:20:27,961 --> 01:20:29,129
I was bringing it to you

1779
01:20:29,163 --> 01:20:30,130
to ask you what you
think I should do.

1780
01:20:30,164 --> 01:20:31,999
It's $300 million, Ma.

1781
01:20:32,032 --> 01:20:33,233
Think about it, seriously.

1782

There is nothing

This is Sid's ticket, you
need to get it back to him.

Where is he?

1785

Let me out of here!

1786
01:20:39,440 --> 01:20:42,644
Mom, I ran all the way
over here, $300 million.

1787
01:20:42,677 --> 01:20:46,080
I need you to take this
ticket back to Sid, it's his.

1788
