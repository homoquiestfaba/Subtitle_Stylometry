181
00:11:17,342 --> 00:11:19,052
At least, not by blood...

182
00:11:19,136 --> 00:11:21,263
I know you adopted me.

183
00:11:21,305 --> 00:11:24,599
And I know that two brothers
have never been closer,

184
00:11:24,683 --> 00:11:27,018
but now,
you have to know the rest.

185
00:11:27,019 --> 00:11:29,521
But now,
you have to know the rest.

186
00:11:44,077 --> 00:11:45,119
(gasps)

187
00:11:45,204 --> 00:11:46,288
Moses.

188
00:11:46,371 --> 00:11:48,373
This is your father.

189
00:11:50,542 --> 00:11:52,877
I'm Jochebed,
your mother.

190
00:11:52,878 --> 00:11:54,087
I'm Jochebed,
your mother.

191
00:11:56,173 --> 00:11:59,134
This is
your sister Miriam,

192
00:11:59,218 --> 00:12:01,929
And that's Aaron,
your elder brother.

193
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:07,226
When you were born,

194
00:12:07,309 --> 00:12:09,019
It was too dangerous
to keep you.

195
00:12:09,102 --> 00:12:10,144
We had to give you up.

196
00:12:10,229 --> 00:12:12,147
There was nothing else
we could do.

197
00:12:12,231 --> 00:12:15,317
I held you at my breast

198
00:12:15,359 --> 00:12:18,695
Until you were
old enough to walk,

199
00:12:18,779 --> 00:12:20,489
And then I gave you
back to her.

200
00:12:20,572 --> 00:12:22,031
Why?

201
00:12:22,115 --> 00:12:24,784
We didn't just want
to save your life,

202
00:12:24,868 --> 00:12:26,327
we wanted it
to be a good one.

203
00:12:26,370 --> 00:12:29,331
We wanted at least one
of our children to have...

204
00:12:29,414 --> 00:12:31,332
more than this.

205
00:12:31,375 --> 00:12:32,834
But you gave me away.

206
00:12:32,918 --> 00:12:35,712
Oh, it was because
we loved you.

207
00:12:37,256 --> 00:12:40,175
(crying) Oh, my son.

208
00:12:40,259 --> 00:12:42,594
Oh, my child!

209
00:12:42,594 --> 00:12:43,845
Oh, my child!

210
00:13:01,071 --> 00:13:02,489
The princess promised

211
00:13:02,572 --> 00:13:05,199
that we could tell you
where you came from.

212
00:13:05,284 --> 00:13:07,619
That's all we want,
that you should know...

213
00:13:07,619 --> 00:13:09,579
That's all we want,
that you should know...

214
00:13:14,751 --> 00:13:17,086
Then you can
forget about us.

215
00:13:17,087 --> 00:13:20,006
Then you can
forget about us.

216
00:14:01,923 --> 00:14:04,258
Inside lies the man
who led us here--Joseph.

217
00:14:04,259 --> 00:14:06,594
Inside lies the man
who led us here--Joseph.

218
00:14:06,595 --> 00:14:08,555
Inside lies the man
who led us here--Joseph.

219
00:14:08,638 --> 00:14:11,891
His brother
sold him as a slave.

220
00:14:11,975 --> 00:14:15,186
He rose to become
the Pharaoh's chief minister.

221
00:14:15,270 --> 00:14:17,605
He brought us here to Egypt,

222
00:14:17,606 --> 00:14:19,357
He brought us here to Egypt,

223
00:14:19,441 --> 00:14:21,776
But when that Pharaoh died,
they enslaved us

224
00:14:21,777 --> 00:14:24,988
But when that Pharaoh died,
they enslaved us

225
00:14:25,072 --> 00:14:27,032
And kept us here.

226
00:14:27,115 --> 00:14:29,283
(wind whistles)

227
00:14:29,368 --> 00:14:31,286
Do you hear that?

228
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:33,705
That's the wind
from the desert.

229
00:14:33,705 --> 00:14:36,290
That's the wind
from the desert.

230
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:38,585
That's where we came from.

231
00:14:38,668 --> 00:14:41,003
Men talk
of the glories of Egypt--

232
00:14:41,004 --> 00:14:43,297
Men talk
of the glories of Egypt--

233
00:14:43,382 --> 00:14:46,301
The things Egypt has built,

234
00:14:46,385 --> 00:14:49,679
but all of it stands
on the bones of Our People.

235
00:14:49,763 --> 00:14:52,098
It's held together
by Our Blood.

236
00:14:52,099 --> 00:14:54,476
It's held together
by Our Blood.

237
00:14:54,518 --> 00:14:56,853
Is he one of your gods?

238
00:14:56,937 --> 00:14:59,272
We don't worship a corpse,
no matter how illustrious.

239
00:14:59,272 --> 00:15:01,607
We don't worship a corpse,
no matter how illustrious.

240
00:15:01,608 --> 00:15:03,568
We don't worship a corpse,
no matter how illustrious.

241
00:15:03,652 --> 00:15:06,279
Then where are your gods?

242
00:15:06,363 --> 00:15:08,073
Did the Egyptian ones
defeat them?

243
00:15:08,156 --> 00:15:11,159
At one time,
we believed in a God--

244
00:15:11,243 --> 00:15:13,578
A powerful one,
the only one.

245
00:15:13,578 --> 00:15:14,704
A powerful one,
the only one.

246
00:15:14,788 --> 00:15:16,706
But he hasn't spoken
in all these years.

247
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:19,334
- Is he dead?
- Some people say that.

248
00:15:19,418 --> 00:15:21,837
No. No, that's not true.

249
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:24,255
Then where is he?
What has he done for us?

250
00:15:24,256 --> 00:15:26,758
Then where is he?
What has he done for us?

251
00:15:26,842 --> 00:15:29,511
Why does he let this
happen to us?!

252
00:15:37,436 --> 00:15:38,437
Moses!

253
00:15:49,239 --> 00:15:51,366
You won't send me away...

254
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:53,785
- To live like that, to be a slave?
- No.

255
00:15:53,785 --> 00:15:55,578
- To live like that, to be a slave?
- No.

256
00:15:55,662 --> 00:15:58,706
You're a prince of Egypt.

257
00:15:58,790 --> 00:16:01,125
Your life was saved
for a reason, Moses.

258
00:16:01,126 --> 00:16:02,252
Your life was saved
for a reason, Moses.

259
00:16:02,335 --> 00:16:05,046
You have a great future
awaiting you.

260
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:07,590
Forget about today.

261
00:16:07,674 --> 00:16:10,009
It was a mistake or a nightmare.

262
00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:12,220
It was a mistake or a nightmare.

263
00:16:12,304 --> 00:16:14,639
Yes, yes,
it had to be a nightmare.

264
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:17,558
Yes, yes,
it had to be a nightmare.

265
00:16:17,601 --> 00:16:19,936
You'll forget about it by morning.

266
00:16:19,936 --> 00:16:22,104
You'll forget about it by morning.

267
00:16:22,189 --> 00:16:24,816
This is where you belong.

268
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:27,235
This is who you are.

269
00:16:27,235 --> 00:16:28,945
This is who you are.

270
00:16:29,029 --> 00:16:31,364
Do you see a slave child there...

271
00:16:31,364 --> 00:16:32,406
Do you see a slave child there...

272
00:16:32,491 --> 00:16:34,826
A descendent of some
sheepherder from the desert?

273
00:16:34,826 --> 00:16:38,037
A descendent of some
sheepherder from the desert?

274
00:16:38,121 --> 00:16:40,915
Or do you see a prince--

275
00:16:40,999 --> 00:16:43,334
A prince who might one day
become Pharaoh of Egypt?

276
00:16:43,335 --> 00:16:46,046
A prince who might one day
become Pharaoh of Egypt?

277
00:16:47,714 --> 00:16:49,716
(men shouting in distance)

278
00:16:52,594 --> 00:16:54,929
Pull harder! Pull!
Come on!

279
00:16:54,930 --> 00:16:57,265
Pull harder! Pull!
Come on!

280
00:16:57,265 --> 00:16:59,850
Pull harder! Pull!
Come on!

281
00:17:05,524 --> 00:17:07,859
You should marry and build
your own palace, Moses.

282
00:17:07,859 --> 00:17:09,443
You should marry and build
your own palace, Moses.

283
00:17:09,528 --> 00:17:11,863
Join me on the next campaign
and see how a soldier lives.

284
00:17:11,863 --> 00:17:13,114
Join me on the next campaign
and see how a soldier lives.

285
00:17:13,198 --> 00:17:15,533
In time, perhaps.

286
00:17:19,329 --> 00:17:20,997
You have to get out
into the desert

287
00:17:21,081 --> 00:17:22,332
where the gods set rules

288
00:17:22,415 --> 00:17:25,459
before you get too soft
for city living.

289
00:17:25,544 --> 00:17:26,836
What is he a god of?

290
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:29,464
Thirst, hunger and slow death?
No, thank you.

291
00:17:29,548 --> 00:17:31,007
I like the city.

292
00:17:31,091 --> 00:17:33,426
All a civilized man needs
is here.

293
00:17:33,426 --> 00:17:34,510
All a civilized man needs
is here.

294
00:17:34,636 --> 00:17:36,971
I have to get my men
ready for review.

295
00:17:36,972 --> 00:17:38,807
I have to get my men
ready for review.

296
00:17:38,890 --> 00:17:40,975
Forget the desert.

297
00:17:41,059 --> 00:17:43,394
You're much more at home
in a library or a marble bath.

298
00:17:43,395 --> 00:17:45,105
You're much more at home
in a library or a marble bath.

299
00:17:46,856 --> 00:17:49,191
(man) Come here.

300
00:17:49,276 --> 00:17:52,487
What's the matter,
don't you like me? (laughs)

301
00:17:52,571 --> 00:17:54,406
- (woman panting)
- No, no! Please, please, please!

302
00:17:54,489 --> 00:17:56,240
- Get out of my way.
- Have mercy. Please don't hurt her.

303
00:17:56,324 --> 00:17:58,784
- Get out of my way you scum!
- She's my wife. Please have mercy.

304
00:17:58,868 --> 00:18:02,121
You dog. Aah! Aah!

305
00:18:02,205 --> 00:18:04,081
You can watch.

306
00:18:04,165 --> 00:18:06,500
It'll be even sweeter.

307
00:18:06,501 --> 00:18:07,710
It'll be even sweeter.

308
00:18:07,794 --> 00:18:09,420
- (woman) Oh!
- Leave her alone.

309
00:18:09,504 --> 00:18:11,422
My prince.

310
00:18:11,506 --> 00:18:13,424
I said, leave her alone.

311
00:18:13,508 --> 00:18:15,426
But she's only a slave.

312
00:18:15,510 --> 00:18:17,053
Don't.

313
00:18:17,137 --> 00:18:18,513
Oh, what would it matter, Prince?
She'd probably enjoy it.

314
00:18:18,597 --> 00:18:19,848
Aah!

315
00:18:19,931 --> 00:18:21,515
Aah! Aah!

316
00:18:48,209 --> 00:18:49,752
Why did you do that?

317
00:18:51,713 --> 00:18:54,424
Why did you kill a man
for punishing a slave?

318
00:18:54,507 --> 00:18:56,842
I was angry. No one
should be treated like that.

319
00:18:56,843 --> 00:18:58,761
I was angry. No one
should be treated like that.

320
00:18:58,845 --> 00:19:00,555
The body's been found.

321
00:19:00,639 --> 00:19:02,557
Pharaoh's given orders
for your arrest.

322
00:19:02,641 --> 00:19:04,059
You have to leave.

323
00:19:04,142 --> 00:19:07,061
- I won't let them take you.
- You don't have any choice.

324
00:19:07,145 --> 00:19:10,439
He has to leave now, immediately.

325
00:19:10,523 --> 00:19:12,399
Why don't you ask your slaves
to protect you?

326
00:19:12,484 --> 00:19:14,027
I don't want
to bring trouble to them.

327
00:19:14,110 --> 00:19:16,654
No, you'd rather
bring trouble here.

328
00:19:16,738 --> 00:19:18,573
Come now.

329
00:19:18,657 --> 00:19:20,617
Could I stand by
and do nothing? Could I?

330
00:19:20,742 --> 00:19:22,660
She was a slave.

331
00:19:24,663 --> 00:19:26,623
Run. Go to your desert
and die,

332
00:19:26,748 --> 00:19:29,751
And while you're dying, think
of what you've thrown away.

333
00:19:29,834 --> 00:19:32,169
Think of the destiny
that awaited you here.

334
00:19:32,170 --> 00:19:34,255
Think of the destiny
that awaited you here.

335
00:19:36,883 --> 00:19:39,135
I'll come and find you,
bring you food and water.

336
00:19:39,219 --> 00:19:42,305
No, no, I won't let you
risk your life for me.

337
00:19:42,389 --> 00:19:45,058
We're brothers.
Don't forget that.

338
00:20:00,699 --> 00:20:02,701
I'll never see you again.

339
00:20:06,705 --> 00:20:09,040
(crying) You can't survive
out there...

340
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:10,791
(crying) You can't survive
out there...

341
00:20:10,834 --> 00:20:12,919
You of all people.

342
00:20:13,002 --> 00:20:14,920
I don't belong there.

343
00:20:15,004 --> 00:20:17,339
I don't belong anywhere.

344
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:18,841
I don't belong anywhere.

345
00:20:18,925 --> 00:20:21,260
They should have let me die that
night when the soldiers came.

346
00:20:21,261 --> 00:20:23,471
They should have let me die that
night when the soldiers came.

347
00:20:23,555 --> 00:20:25,890
Why did I live
and so many others die?

348
00:20:25,890 --> 00:20:27,224
Why did I live
and so many others die?

349
00:20:34,482 --> 00:20:36,150
Wait!

350
00:20:38,862 --> 00:20:40,947
(whispers)
The nights are cold.

351
00:20:56,755 --> 00:20:59,758
<i>383</i>

352
00:22:30,849 --> 00:22:32,350
(bleating)

353
00:22:32,433 --> 00:22:33,934
(man) Come on!

354
00:22:45,655 --> 00:22:47,073
Get out of here!

355
00:22:47,156 --> 00:22:49,199
The water's ours!

356
00:22:49,284 --> 00:22:50,785
We were here first.

357
00:22:50,869 --> 00:22:52,704
You think I care?

358
00:22:52,787 --> 00:22:54,205
I said,
we were here first.

359
00:22:54,289 --> 00:22:55,790
I told you to go!

360
00:22:55,874 --> 00:22:57,250
(gasps)

361
00:23:00,044 --> 00:23:02,296
Stop!

362
00:23:12,181 --> 00:23:14,183
You there...

363
00:23:15,643 --> 00:23:16,685
Ohh!

364
00:23:16,769 --> 00:23:19,104
(grunting)

365
00:23:19,105 --> 00:23:20,481
(grunting)

366
00:23:23,109 --> 00:23:26,445
Take your flock away.

367
00:23:47,926 --> 00:23:50,261
You could've been killed
in a quarrel that wasn't yours.

368
00:23:50,261 --> 00:23:52,429
You could've been killed
in a quarrel that wasn't yours.

369
00:23:52,513 --> 00:23:54,431
When a man
hasn't mastered his temper,

370
00:23:54,515 --> 00:23:56,934
He'll find
a quarrel anywhere.

371
00:24:02,023 --> 00:24:04,358
My father will wish
to thank you anyway.

372
00:24:04,359 --> 00:24:05,485
My father will wish
to thank you anyway.

373
00:24:05,568 --> 00:24:07,861
Unless you have
someplace...

374
00:24:07,946 --> 00:24:10,281
Someone to journey to.

375
00:24:14,869 --> 00:24:16,036
Egyptian.

376
00:24:17,956 --> 00:24:19,874
I don't know what I am.

377
00:24:19,958 --> 00:24:23,044
But you've lived in Egypt?

378
00:24:23,086 --> 00:24:25,213
Yes.

379
00:24:25,296 --> 00:24:28,048
Never liked cities...

380
00:24:28,091 --> 00:24:30,259
Especially theirs.

381
00:24:30,343 --> 00:24:33,054
Unnatural.

382
00:24:33,096 --> 00:24:36,349
Make you soft.
Make you crazy.

383
00:24:36,432 --> 00:24:38,892
In the cities they say
the desert does that--

384
00:24:38,977 --> 00:24:41,187
Makes men mad--

385
00:24:41,270 --> 00:24:43,855
If you can even find
a way to survive in it.

386
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:45,441
Survive?

387
00:24:45,525 --> 00:24:47,193
It's got all you need.

388
00:24:47,276 --> 00:24:49,611
Not much more than that--
true, but all you need.

389
00:24:49,612 --> 00:24:50,696
Not much more than that--
true, but all you need.

390
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:52,072
Just have to look.

391
00:24:52,156 --> 00:24:54,491
Seven daughters--
I thought it was a curse.

392
00:24:54,492 --> 00:24:56,410
Seven daughters--
I thought it was a curse.

393
00:24:56,494 --> 00:24:58,913
What did I do to deserve it?

394
00:24:58,997 --> 00:25:00,915
But they've learned.

395
00:25:00,999 --> 00:25:02,458
Proud of them.

396
00:25:04,002 --> 00:25:05,712
Especially that one.

397
00:25:05,795 --> 00:25:07,588
To have a man around

398
00:25:07,672 --> 00:25:09,799
When it's needed...

399
00:25:09,882 --> 00:25:11,592
Like today.

400
00:25:11,676 --> 00:25:14,345
I didn't stop to think.

401
00:25:14,429 --> 00:25:16,931
It could've ended badly
for everyone.

402
00:25:17,015 --> 00:25:19,726
But it didn't.

403
00:25:19,809 --> 00:25:22,394
You did what a son
would have done for me...

404
00:25:25,023 --> 00:25:26,733
Or a son-in-law.

405
00:25:29,027 --> 00:25:31,362
Even one who walked out
from the desert

406
00:25:31,362 --> 00:25:32,946
Even one who walked out
from the desert

407
00:25:33,031 --> 00:25:35,366
Like a man
without a past,

408
00:25:35,366 --> 00:25:36,575
Like a man
without a past,

409
00:25:36,659 --> 00:25:38,994
Or who was running
away from one.

410
00:25:38,995 --> 00:25:40,913
Or who was running
away from one.

411
00:26:23,331 --> 00:26:26,334
(imitating goats bleating)

412
00:26:29,087 --> 00:26:32,090
(screeching)

413
00:26:58,741 --> 00:27:01,744
(women trilling zaghareet)

414
00:27:01,828 --> 00:27:05,122
(cheering)

415
00:27:28,271 --> 00:27:31,148
<i>383</i>

416
00:27:58,342 --> 00:28:00,677
(baby crying)

417
00:28:00,678 --> 00:28:02,179
(baby crying)

418
00:28:05,057 --> 00:28:06,183
Oh.

419
00:28:11,772 --> 00:28:14,775
(laughter)

420
00:28:21,824 --> 00:28:25,160
Shh, shh, shh.

421
00:28:25,286 --> 00:28:27,621
Gershom.
I name you Gershom.

422
00:28:27,622 --> 00:28:30,374
Gershom.
I name you Gershom.

423
00:28:30,458 --> 00:28:32,376
It means "stranger."

424
00:28:34,045 --> 00:28:36,380
Like the stranger
you took into your family.

425
00:28:36,380 --> 00:28:37,506
Like the stranger
you took into your family.

426
00:28:37,590 --> 00:28:39,383
Can you take
that sack?

427
00:28:45,223 --> 00:28:47,600
Come on, now!
Hup! Hup!

428
00:28:47,683 --> 00:28:50,227
(baby cries)

429
00:28:57,026 --> 00:28:59,153
There's green grass
over there.

430
00:28:59,237 --> 00:29:00,571
Keep moving.

431
00:29:00,655 --> 00:29:02,573
There must be
a stream there.

432
00:29:02,657 --> 00:29:04,659
Don't even look
up there.

433
00:29:26,264 --> 00:29:28,599
Mount Horeb--
the holy mount.

434
00:29:28,599 --> 00:29:30,475
Mount Horeb--
the holy mount.

435
00:29:30,559 --> 00:29:33,144
It's not safe
to go near it.

436
00:29:33,229 --> 00:29:35,022
There's danger there.

437
00:30:12,977 --> 00:30:15,646
(male voice whispering)
Moses...

438
00:30:18,399 --> 00:30:20,734
(gasps)

439
00:30:20,735 --> 00:30:21,861
(gasps)

440
00:30:21,944 --> 00:30:24,112
This is holy ground.

441
00:30:24,196 --> 00:30:26,531
I am the God
of your Fathers,

442
00:30:26,532 --> 00:30:28,283
I am the God
of your Fathers,

443
00:30:28,409 --> 00:30:31,620
of your people
who are slaves in Egypt.

444
00:30:31,704 --> 00:30:34,039
I know
of their suffering.

445
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:35,207
I know
of their suffering.

446
00:30:35,291 --> 00:30:37,501
I have chosen you
to free them,

447
00:30:37,585 --> 00:30:39,920
to lead them to the land which
I promised their forefathers.

448
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:41,046
To lead them to the land which
I promised their forefathers.

449
00:30:41,130 --> 00:30:43,132
Go--go back to Egypt?

450
00:30:45,176 --> 00:30:46,719
I killed a man there.

451
00:30:46,802 --> 00:30:48,678
You will go back.

452
00:30:48,763 --> 00:30:51,640
But why should they
listen to me?

453
00:30:51,724 --> 00:30:54,143
Why should the Pharaoh
listen to me?

454
00:30:54,226 --> 00:30:56,269
I will be with you.

455
00:30:56,354 --> 00:30:58,689
You say you're their God
and my God.

456
00:30:58,689 --> 00:31:00,190
You say you're their God
and my God.

457
00:31:00,274 --> 00:31:02,192
Well, what is your name?

458
00:31:02,276 --> 00:31:05,320
I Am Who I Am.

459
00:31:05,446 --> 00:31:07,281
They won't listen to me.

460
00:31:07,365 --> 00:31:09,784
They won't believe
that you've spoken to me.

461
00:31:09,867 --> 00:31:11,785
They won't.
They won't. They won't.

462
00:31:11,869 --> 00:31:14,371
Throw your staff
to the ground.

463
00:31:16,499 --> 00:31:18,375
(hissing)

464
00:31:23,381 --> 00:31:26,050
Pick it up.

465
00:31:33,182 --> 00:31:34,474
Oh! (panting)

466
00:31:34,558 --> 00:31:36,476
Don't send me.
Don't send me.

467
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:38,478
I'm not
the person you need.

468
00:31:38,562 --> 00:31:40,397
I can't do this.
I can't do this.

469
00:31:40,481 --> 00:31:42,399
It's you
who I've chosen.

470
00:32:41,125 --> 00:32:43,210
(crying)

471
00:32:43,294 --> 00:32:45,629
If your people need you,
then you must go.

472
00:32:45,629 --> 00:32:47,464
If your people need you,
then you must go.

473
00:32:49,467 --> 00:32:51,385
I've never even
lived with them.

474
00:32:51,469 --> 00:32:53,804
If their God
is telling you to go...

475
00:32:53,804 --> 00:32:55,388
If their God
is telling you to go...

476
00:32:56,765 --> 00:32:59,100
Is he the same god
of the mountains?

477
00:32:59,101 --> 00:33:00,185
Is he the same god
of the mountains?

478
00:33:02,062 --> 00:33:04,773
I don't know.

479
00:33:04,857 --> 00:33:06,775
When I asked Him His name,

480
00:33:06,859 --> 00:33:09,194
He gave me an answer
I didn't really understand.

481
00:33:09,195 --> 00:33:10,779
He gave me an answer
I didn't really understand.

482
00:33:10,863 --> 00:33:13,031
It's as if He wants me
to discover something

483
00:33:13,115 --> 00:33:15,367
about Him for myself.

484
00:33:19,622 --> 00:33:22,082
I never asked for this.

485
00:33:22,166 --> 00:33:24,501
You could always say no.

486
00:33:24,502 --> 00:33:25,920
You could always say no.

487
00:33:26,003 --> 00:33:28,422
The desert's a big place.

488
00:33:28,506 --> 00:33:30,841
Perhaps big enough
for even a God not to find you.

489
00:33:30,841 --> 00:33:33,009
Perhaps big enough
for even a God not to find you.

490
00:33:33,093 --> 00:33:36,096
(crying)

491
00:34:26,564 --> 00:34:29,483
But... why aren't we happy?

492
00:34:29,567 --> 00:34:31,485
We should be happy.

493
00:34:31,569 --> 00:34:33,320
I listened,

494
00:34:33,404 --> 00:34:35,406
and I'm obeying.

495
00:34:37,825 --> 00:34:40,577
He talked to me.
I can't talk to him.

496
00:35:01,890 --> 00:35:03,057
(groans)

497
00:35:03,142 --> 00:35:05,519
You'd think if this
is what he wanted,

498
00:35:05,603 --> 00:35:08,147
He'd make the going
a little easier.

499
00:35:21,702 --> 00:35:24,705
(crowd speaking indistinctly)

500
00:35:26,290 --> 00:35:28,500
(cheers and laughter)

501
00:35:44,642 --> 00:35:46,644
Stop.

502
00:35:58,947 --> 00:35:59,989
Moses?

503
00:36:00,074 --> 00:36:02,951
Moses...

504
00:36:05,079 --> 00:36:08,082
My son!

505
00:36:11,752 --> 00:36:13,587
Did I bring trouble to you?

506
00:36:13,671 --> 00:36:16,006
All that matters
is that you're here again.

507
00:36:16,006 --> 00:36:17,340
All that matters
is that you're here again.

508
00:36:17,424 --> 00:36:19,342
You don't
have to hide anymore.

509
00:36:19,426 --> 00:36:21,344
The old Pharaoh is dead.

510
00:36:21,428 --> 00:36:24,013
Ramses is Pharaoh now.

511
00:36:24,098 --> 00:36:27,226
It'll all be
like it was before.

512
00:36:27,309 --> 00:36:30,061
You'll be a prince again.

513
00:36:30,145 --> 00:36:32,689
This is my wife...

514
00:36:37,820 --> 00:36:39,488
And my son.

515
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:44,618
Where I go, they go.

516
00:36:44,702 --> 00:36:45,786
The palace.

517
00:36:45,828 --> 00:36:48,163
No, not there.

518
00:36:48,163 --> 00:36:49,455
No, not there.

519
00:37:20,738 --> 00:37:23,407
Is this the house
of Amram Jochebed?

520
00:37:23,490 --> 00:37:24,908
It was.

521
00:37:28,370 --> 00:37:30,288
And you are?

522
00:37:30,372 --> 00:37:31,623
Moses.

523
00:37:31,707 --> 00:37:34,167
My name is Moses.

524
00:37:38,255 --> 00:37:40,757
I'm Miriam...

525
00:37:40,841 --> 00:37:42,759
Your sister.

526
00:37:46,764 --> 00:37:49,391
Can it really be you?

527
00:37:59,777 --> 00:38:01,195
Come.

528
00:38:01,278 --> 00:38:03,697
Please, come.

529
00:38:10,579 --> 00:38:12,706
They're both dead now--

530
00:38:12,790 --> 00:38:15,584
Our father first

531
00:38:15,667 --> 00:38:18,127
And then our mother.

532
00:38:18,212 --> 00:38:20,881
But she never forgot you.

533
00:38:20,923 --> 00:38:23,008
I'd see her sitting there,

534
00:38:23,091 --> 00:38:25,718
and I knew she was thinking
about where you were--

535
00:38:25,803 --> 00:38:28,138
What had
become of you.

536
00:38:28,138 --> 00:38:29,222
What had
become of you.

537
00:38:29,306 --> 00:38:31,224
Yes...

538
00:38:31,308 --> 00:38:34,477
You were always
her favorite

539
00:38:34,561 --> 00:38:36,729
Even though
you never lived here,

540
00:38:36,814 --> 00:38:38,774
Never had to live with--

541
00:38:40,526 --> 00:38:42,945
Why are you back?

542
00:38:43,028 --> 00:38:44,654
What do you want...

543
00:38:44,738 --> 00:38:46,030
Egyptian?

544
00:38:48,951 --> 00:38:50,911
No man believes
he speaks to God

545
00:38:50,953 --> 00:38:52,829
unless he's out
of his mind.

546
00:38:52,913 --> 00:38:54,289
He spoke to me.

547
00:38:54,373 --> 00:38:56,249
And I argued with Him.

548
00:38:56,333 --> 00:38:57,334
With God?

549
00:38:57,417 --> 00:38:58,751
He can be demanding.

550
00:38:58,836 --> 00:39:01,338
He gets angry at times.
He's unpredictable.

551
00:39:01,421 --> 00:39:04,132
He has all this power,
and yet, he has to come

552
00:39:04,216 --> 00:39:07,135
To somebody like me
to do things on his behalf.

553
00:39:07,219 --> 00:39:10,138
That makes him a little
short-tempered at times.

554
00:39:10,222 --> 00:39:12,515
You are talking about him
as if he's a person.

555
00:39:12,599 --> 00:39:14,350
He is... To me,

556
00:39:14,434 --> 00:39:16,936
- Although he's still my God. He is our God.
- You are mad.

557
00:39:16,979 --> 00:39:18,939
He's told me how
you're going to help me.

558
00:39:18,981 --> 00:39:21,984
- Me?
- I know what you think about me, Aaron,

559
00:39:22,067 --> 00:39:23,568
But God wants to use you, too.

560
00:39:23,652 --> 00:39:26,196
You're a part of his plan
just as much as I am.

561
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:28,615
So God lets us be kept
in slavery for all these years,

562
00:39:28,615 --> 00:39:30,533
So God lets us be kept
in slavery for all these years,

563
00:39:30,617 --> 00:39:32,535
and then he decides
to free us,

564
00:39:32,619 --> 00:39:34,078
and the person that he chooses
to do that is you?

565
00:39:34,162 --> 00:39:35,580
Helped by you.

566
00:39:35,664 --> 00:39:37,749
But he doesn't send you back
with an army--

567
00:39:37,833 --> 00:39:39,125
Just that barbarian wife.

568
00:39:39,209 --> 00:39:42,337
You're going to lead
a rebellion?

569
00:39:42,421 --> 00:39:45,424
You, who's never spent
more than one night here?

570
00:39:45,507 --> 00:39:48,801
Who everyone here knows
you turned your back on us!

571
00:39:48,886 --> 00:39:50,888
You turned your back
on everyone!

572
00:39:50,971 --> 00:39:53,306
All I know is that
I am who I am has sent me.

573
00:39:53,307 --> 00:39:55,600
All I know is that
I am who I am has sent me.

574
00:40:02,399 --> 00:40:03,441
Who?

575
00:40:03,525 --> 00:40:06,110
I Am Who I Am.

576
00:40:19,041 --> 00:40:21,001
How do you know that name?

577
00:40:21,043 --> 00:40:23,378
God told me his name.

578
00:40:23,378 --> 00:40:24,712
God told me his name.

579
00:40:24,796 --> 00:40:27,840
But he wants me
to think about it.

580
00:40:27,925 --> 00:40:30,844
Find some...
inner meaning in it.

581
00:40:30,928 --> 00:40:33,263
That name is
never to be spoken.

582
00:40:33,263 --> 00:40:35,723
That name is
never to be spoken.

583
00:40:35,807 --> 00:40:37,725
When Joseph
brought us here...

584
00:40:37,809 --> 00:40:39,894
he told us
that one of the ways

585
00:40:40,020 --> 00:40:42,355
that God would reveal himself
was in those words.

586
00:40:42,356 --> 00:40:43,440
That God would reveal himself
was in those words.

587
00:40:44,942 --> 00:40:48,153
" Am Who I Am."

588
00:41:18,183 --> 00:41:19,475
Time isn't right.

589
00:41:19,559 --> 00:41:20,893
Even if we believed you...

590
00:41:20,978 --> 00:41:22,688
The people
aren't ready for this.

591
00:41:22,771 --> 00:41:25,148
You think the Egyptians will
let us go just because we asked?

592
00:41:25,232 --> 00:41:27,776
You are talking
of a rebellion!

593
00:41:27,859 --> 00:41:30,278
It takes years of planning.
It takes an army.

594
00:41:32,072 --> 00:41:34,157
You think
we don't want freedom?

595
00:41:34,241 --> 00:41:35,909
You think we haven't
dreamed of it?

596
00:41:35,993 --> 00:41:38,370
The Egyptians will fight back,

597
00:41:38,453 --> 00:41:40,705
And we know what that means.

598
00:41:40,789 --> 00:41:42,373
And who are you anyway?

599
00:41:42,457 --> 00:41:44,208
He's Moses.

600
00:41:45,711 --> 00:41:47,963
He saved my life

601
00:41:48,088 --> 00:41:50,006
And my wife's honor.

602
00:41:54,094 --> 00:41:56,221
This is a good man.

603
00:41:56,304 --> 00:41:59,223
Whatever he has to say,
you should listen to him.

604
00:41:59,307 --> 00:42:01,183
He may be a good man.

605
00:42:01,268 --> 00:42:03,186
That doesn't mean we should
follow him to disaster.

606
00:42:03,270 --> 00:42:05,188
That we should lose
what little we have...

607
00:42:05,272 --> 00:42:07,607
just because he says
that God spoke to him.

608
00:42:07,607 --> 00:42:09,233
Just because he says
that God spoke to him.

609
00:42:09,317 --> 00:42:10,943
Did he?

610
00:42:13,030 --> 00:42:15,157
In the desert, yes.

611
00:42:18,285 --> 00:42:20,287
I don't know
why God chose me.

612
00:42:23,498 --> 00:42:26,459
I'm a stranger.
I've never shared your burdens.

613
00:42:26,543 --> 00:42:28,461
Some of you probably think

614
00:42:28,545 --> 00:42:30,463
I'm more of an Egyptian
than a slave even now,

615
00:42:30,547 --> 00:42:32,882
But I know what happened to me
out there.

616
00:42:32,883 --> 00:42:33,967
But I know what happened to me
out there.

617
00:42:34,051 --> 00:42:36,386
I know what God wants me to do

618
00:42:36,386 --> 00:42:37,929
I know what God wants me to do

619
00:42:38,013 --> 00:42:40,265
With Aaron's help.

620
00:42:42,976 --> 00:42:45,728
<i>383</i>

621
00:43:00,077 --> 00:43:02,662
Pharaoh,
free your slaves!

622
00:43:08,085 --> 00:43:10,420
They came here as free men.
Let them leave as free men.

623
00:43:10,420 --> 00:43:13,005
They came here as free men.
Let them leave as free men.

624
00:43:13,090 --> 00:43:16,426
We've given you our labor
and our blood for 400 years.

625
00:43:16,510 --> 00:43:18,428
Now you give us
something--

626
00:43:18,512 --> 00:43:20,013
Our freedom.

627
00:43:20,097 --> 00:43:22,015
My people built this.

628
00:43:22,099 --> 00:43:24,434
They created
the wealth of Egypt.

629
00:43:24,434 --> 00:43:25,977
They created
the wealth of Egypt.

630
00:43:26,061 --> 00:43:28,396
Is their freedom too much
to ask in return?

631
00:43:28,396 --> 00:43:30,231
Is their freedom too much
to ask in return?

632
00:43:33,944 --> 00:43:36,112
Guard!

633
00:44:10,438 --> 00:44:12,440
Do you have an army?

634
00:44:12,524 --> 00:44:13,900
No.

635
00:44:13,984 --> 00:44:16,945
Do the other slaves
have an army?

636
00:44:17,028 --> 00:44:19,071
No.

637
00:44:19,156 --> 00:44:21,867
Then why should I
let them go?

638
00:44:21,950 --> 00:44:24,577
Because God demands it.

639
00:44:24,661 --> 00:44:26,996
And where is he,
this God of yours?

640
00:44:26,997 --> 00:44:29,749
And where is he,
this God of yours?

641
00:44:29,833 --> 00:44:32,377
I see my gods...

642
00:44:32,460 --> 00:44:34,837
My priests.

643
00:44:34,921 --> 00:44:36,964
I don't see yours.

644
00:44:37,048 --> 00:44:39,383
But he's more powerful a God
than all of yours.

645
00:44:39,384 --> 00:44:40,760
But he's more powerful a God
than all of yours.

646
00:44:40,844 --> 00:44:43,304
Really?

647
00:44:43,388 --> 00:44:45,723
A slave god more powerful
than the gods of all this?

648
00:44:45,724 --> 00:44:48,143
A slave god more powerful
than the gods of all this?

649
00:44:55,150 --> 00:44:56,609
(hissing)

650
00:44:56,693 --> 00:44:58,194
(all gasping)

651
00:45:08,288 --> 00:45:10,290
(chuckles)

652
00:45:11,833 --> 00:45:14,168
The children of Egypt
perform tricks like this.

653
00:45:14,169 --> 00:45:15,420
The children of Egypt
perform tricks like this.

654
00:45:15,503 --> 00:45:17,922
(laughter)

655
00:45:18,006 --> 00:45:19,882
What are you trying to prove?

656
00:45:49,996 --> 00:45:52,331
You allow your people
to follow their gods.

657
00:45:52,332 --> 00:45:53,499
You allow your people
to follow their gods.

658
00:45:53,583 --> 00:45:55,918
Let us follow ours.

659
00:45:56,002 --> 00:45:58,838
Let us go into the desert
for three days to worship.

660
00:46:05,136 --> 00:46:07,263
And then what?

661
00:46:12,602 --> 00:46:15,646
You will willingly return?

662
00:46:15,730 --> 00:46:18,441
Perhaps in that time
you'll change your mind.

663
00:46:18,525 --> 00:46:21,277
I doubt it.

664
00:46:24,656 --> 00:46:25,990
Enough!

665
00:46:28,535 --> 00:46:30,870
Pharaoh will not
haggle with a slave.

666
00:46:30,870 --> 00:46:34,206
Pharaoh will not
haggle with a slave.

667
00:46:36,293 --> 00:46:38,211
Take them back
to the quarters.

668
00:46:38,295 --> 00:46:40,797
They should be at work
with the others.

669
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:43,215
A slave is still a slave,
even if he thinks

670
00:46:43,216 --> 00:46:44,383
A slave is still a slave,
even if he thinks

671
00:46:44,467 --> 00:46:47,553
his God has told him
to argue with his master.

672
00:46:47,637 --> 00:46:49,513
Menerith?

673
00:46:49,597 --> 00:46:51,682
You make sure
that one knows

674
00:46:51,766 --> 00:46:54,101
how hard slaves
are expected to work.

675
00:46:54,102 --> 00:46:55,186
How hard slaves
are expected to work.

676
00:47:02,402 --> 00:47:05,321
It's you.

677
00:47:09,576 --> 00:47:11,828
This is my brother, too.

678
00:47:11,911 --> 00:47:14,413
I see only
one of our masters.

679
00:47:14,456 --> 00:47:16,082
He's my brother.

680
00:47:19,419 --> 00:47:21,546
Is it true?

681
00:47:21,629 --> 00:47:24,423
You found the God
you were always seeking?

682
00:47:24,507 --> 00:47:26,342
He found me.

683
00:47:30,221 --> 00:47:32,181
And did he send you
back here?

684
00:47:32,265 --> 00:47:34,809
He does what he wants.

685
00:47:34,893 --> 00:47:36,811
I'm learning that.

686
00:47:36,895 --> 00:47:38,938
Sometimes
I argue with him,

687
00:47:39,022 --> 00:47:40,773
but he always wins.

688
00:47:40,857 --> 00:47:43,776
He won't win
with Ramses.

689
00:47:43,860 --> 00:47:46,195
Despite appearances,
he's a weak, insecure man.

690
00:47:46,196 --> 00:47:47,488
Despite appearances,
he's a weak, insecure man.

691
00:47:47,572 --> 00:47:50,616
They're the most dangerous
when you attack them.

692
00:47:50,700 --> 00:47:53,619
You didn't just attack him.
You humiliated him in public.

693
00:47:55,372 --> 00:47:58,208
I don't suppose
you could talk our brother

694
00:47:58,291 --> 00:48:00,293
Into leaving things
as they are?

695
00:48:00,377 --> 00:48:02,212
I'm his brother.
You're his owner.

696
00:48:02,295 --> 00:48:04,213
Aaron's as
hot-tempered as me.

697
00:48:04,297 --> 00:48:05,923
His tongue
is just as sharp.

698
00:48:06,007 --> 00:48:08,843
Maybe that's why God
chose us to work together.

699
00:48:08,927 --> 00:48:11,888
- And die together.
- If it comes to that, yes.

700
00:48:11,971 --> 00:48:15,224
It won't. I told you.
God spoke to me.

701
00:48:15,308 --> 00:48:17,226
He made me a promise.

702
00:48:17,310 --> 00:48:19,312
He may be difficult,
but sometimes I wonder

703
00:48:19,396 --> 00:48:22,315
if he doesn't think he made
a mistake in choosing me.

704
00:48:22,399 --> 00:48:25,402
But he made me a promise.
He will not break it.

705
00:48:27,904 --> 00:48:30,823

706
00:48:30,907 --> 00:48:33,910

No water for him!
Go on!

713
00:49:17,078 --> 00:49:18,579
No water for him!
Go on!

714
00:49:20,373 --> 00:49:22,458
(sobbing)

715
00:49:26,463 --> 00:49:29,632
(loud, indistinct arguing)

716
00:49:29,716 --> 00:49:31,801
(man) It's Moses' fault!

717
00:49:31,885 --> 00:49:33,595
(man)
Look at how we suffer!

718
00:49:33,678 --> 00:49:36,013
Pharaoh died because
this Moses upset the Pharaoh!

719
00:49:36,014 --> 00:49:38,099
Pharaoh died because
this Moses upset the Pharaoh!

720
00:49:38,183 --> 00:49:40,393
- Where did he come from?
- Who is he?

721
00:49:40,477 --> 00:49:43,104
What gives him the right
to speak for us?

722
00:49:43,188 --> 00:49:46,399
What have you done to us?

723
00:49:46,483 --> 00:49:49,319
Now Pharaoh has ordered us
to collect our own straw.

724
00:49:49,402 --> 00:49:50,861
Listen to him!

725
00:49:50,945 --> 00:49:52,404
Do you know how long
that will take each day?

726
00:49:52,489 --> 00:49:54,407
We still have to
do the same work!

727
00:49:54,491 --> 00:49:55,992
Listen! Listen to him!

728
00:49:56,075 --> 00:49:57,910
He died just trying
to keep up with the work!

729
00:49:57,994 --> 00:49:58,995
Listen!

730
00:49:59,078 --> 00:50:00,996
Which one of us
will die tomorrow

731
00:50:01,080 --> 00:50:03,707
- and the day after, thanks to you?
- Listen!

732
00:50:06,044 --> 00:50:08,421
Would you rather stay slaves?
Is that it?

733
00:50:08,505 --> 00:50:11,591
You like your chains?

734
00:50:11,633 --> 00:50:14,594
You want your wives and your
children to live like animals?

735
00:50:14,636 --> 00:50:16,596
Do you want permission
to live and die?

736
00:50:16,638 --> 00:50:18,973
(shouting)

737
00:50:18,973 --> 00:50:20,766
(shouting)

738
00:50:20,850 --> 00:50:22,893
(man) What can we do?

739
00:50:22,977 --> 00:50:24,728
The Egyptians killed him.

740
00:50:24,812 --> 00:50:27,731
They killed him!

741
00:50:27,815 --> 00:50:30,150
Tomorrow they might kill you
or you or you!

742
00:50:30,151 --> 00:50:32,778
Tomorrow they might kill you
or you or you!

743
00:50:32,862 --> 00:50:35,906
Years ago, their soldiers--
they came here in the night,

744
00:50:35,990 --> 00:50:38,325
and they killed
all the newborn males.

745
00:50:38,326 --> 00:50:39,410
And they killed
all the newborn males.

746
00:50:39,494 --> 00:50:41,829
You didn't want
to fight back then.

747
00:50:41,913 --> 00:50:43,456
You don't want
to fight back now!

748
00:50:43,540 --> 00:50:45,458
No, you want to blame those
who want to save you

749
00:50:45,542 --> 00:50:47,460
from such a thing
happening again!

750
00:50:47,544 --> 00:50:49,879
Because a man
is born in slavery,

751
00:50:49,879 --> 00:50:51,255
Because a man
is born in slavery,

752
00:50:51,339 --> 00:50:53,466
that doesn't mean
that he is a slave!

753
00:50:53,550 --> 00:50:55,885
He has to think of himself
as a slave before he is one.

754
00:50:55,885 --> 00:50:57,261
He has to think of himself
as a slave before he is one.

755
00:50:57,345 --> 00:50:59,680
To be a free man, you have
to stop thinking like one.

756
00:50:59,681 --> 00:51:02,016
To be a free man, you have
to stop thinking like one.

757
00:51:02,016 --> 00:51:03,475
To be a free man, you have
to stop thinking like one.

758
00:51:03,560 --> 00:51:05,895
God sent me here
to lead you out of here!

759
00:51:05,895 --> 00:51:08,147
God sent me here
to lead you out of here!

760
00:51:08,231 --> 00:51:11,150
How do we know it was you
he spoke to?

761
00:51:11,234 --> 00:51:12,944
And what he said?

762
00:51:13,027 --> 00:51:16,321
My words--My words
aren't enough for you?

763
00:51:16,406 --> 00:51:18,866
They weren't good enough
for the Pharaoh.

764
00:51:18,950 --> 00:51:21,285
That's the point.

765
00:51:21,286 --> 00:51:22,453
That's the point.

766
00:51:22,537 --> 00:51:25,039
(shouting)

767
00:51:34,966 --> 00:51:38,302
You've thought it over?

768
00:51:38,386 --> 00:51:40,596
Come to plead with me?

769
00:51:43,099 --> 00:51:45,851
Apologize.

770
00:51:45,935 --> 00:51:49,229
To give you
one final warning.

771
00:51:49,314 --> 00:51:51,983
Free your slaves.

772
00:51:55,612 --> 00:51:56,946
Guard!

773
00:52:07,707 --> 00:52:10,543
But why? Why are you
sending me away?

774
00:52:10,627 --> 00:52:13,296
- Don't you love me anymore?
- I love you.

775
00:52:13,379 --> 00:52:15,005
- Don't you love your son?
- Yes.

776
00:52:15,089 --> 00:52:16,590
Then why do I have to leave?

777
00:52:16,716 --> 00:52:19,051
I'm asking everyone to give up
everything they've ever known.

778
00:52:19,052 --> 00:52:20,553
I'm asking everyone to give up
everything they've ever known.

779
00:52:20,637 --> 00:52:22,722
I have to give up
something, too.

780
00:52:22,805 --> 00:52:24,973
Me? Gershom?

781
00:52:25,058 --> 00:52:27,393
If there were any other way,
but I have so much to do.

782
00:52:27,393 --> 00:52:28,977
If there were any other way,
but I have so much to do.

783
00:52:29,062 --> 00:52:31,773
- Terrible things are about to happen--
- Shh.

784
00:52:31,856 --> 00:52:34,567
More terrible than
anyone has ever known.

785
00:52:34,651 --> 00:52:36,944
I don't want the two people
who mean most to me

786
00:52:37,028 --> 00:52:38,821
To be here for them.

787
00:52:45,828 --> 00:52:48,163
I know how powerful
this God is.

788
00:52:48,164 --> 00:52:49,582
I know how powerful
this God is.

789
00:52:49,666 --> 00:52:52,001
He's more powerful
than anyone can ever imagine.

790
00:52:52,001 --> 00:52:53,460
He's more powerful
than anyone can ever imagine.

791
00:53:08,976 --> 00:53:11,436
Side by side
Moses and his brother

792
00:53:11,521 --> 00:53:13,856
took on the might of Egypt.

793
00:53:13,940 --> 00:53:15,524
It's time.

794
00:53:31,541 --> 00:53:33,251
First the Nile--

795
00:53:33,334 --> 00:53:36,086
The lifeline of Egypt
turned to blood.

796
00:53:36,170 --> 00:53:37,588
(gasping)

797
00:53:40,842 --> 00:53:42,301
Aah!

798
00:53:42,385 --> 00:53:44,720
(shouting)

799
00:53:44,721 --> 00:53:46,222
(shouting)

800
00:53:57,150 --> 00:53:58,484
Look!

801
00:54:05,867 --> 00:54:08,202
It is red silt from the river.

802
00:54:08,202 --> 00:54:11,538
It is red silt from the river.

803
00:54:11,622 --> 00:54:14,541
Come and see the trick.

804
00:54:19,630 --> 00:54:21,965
Oh. (laughs)
Look at that.

805
00:54:21,966 --> 00:54:23,300
Oh. (laughs)
Look at that.

806
00:54:35,605 --> 00:54:37,940
(laughing)

807
00:54:37,940 --> 00:54:39,274
(laughing)

808
00:54:41,986 --> 00:54:43,529
Enough.

809
00:54:45,656 --> 00:54:47,741
Take it away!

810
00:54:50,495 --> 00:54:53,539
When the river died,

811
00:54:53,623 --> 00:54:56,709
the animals that survived
invaded the land.

812
00:54:56,793 --> 00:54:59,796
(croaking)

813
00:55:06,594 --> 00:55:09,305
Aah!

814
00:55:17,939 --> 00:55:19,649
Aah!

815
00:55:20,775 --> 00:55:23,027
Aah!

816
00:55:23,110 --> 00:55:25,821
(shouting)

817
00:55:25,905 --> 00:55:27,948
And then the animals died...

818
00:55:28,032 --> 00:55:30,034
and starvation threatened.

819
00:55:30,117 --> 00:55:32,410
Oh.

820
00:55:32,495 --> 00:55:35,789
(crying)

821
00:55:39,836 --> 00:55:42,171
Your quarrel is with me.

822
00:55:42,171 --> 00:55:43,755
Your quarrel is with me.

823
00:55:43,840 --> 00:55:46,175
Your God's quarrel
is with me.

824
00:55:46,175 --> 00:55:47,926
Your God's quarrel
is with me.

825
00:55:49,971 --> 00:55:52,974
Must all my people suffer
because of it?

826
00:55:53,057 --> 00:55:56,310
Unless you do his bidding, yes.

827
00:55:58,938 --> 00:56:01,941
Tell him to do his worst.

828
00:56:01,983 --> 00:56:04,151
I'll not surrender to him...

829
00:56:05,987 --> 00:56:08,322
Or to you.

830
00:56:08,322 --> 00:56:09,406
Or to you.

831
00:56:11,868 --> 00:56:14,579
(locusts chirping)

832
00:56:14,662 --> 00:56:16,288
Then the locusts came

833
00:56:16,372 --> 00:56:18,540
and ate what little food
was left.

834
00:56:24,672 --> 00:56:27,007
Help! Ohh!

835
00:56:27,008 --> 00:56:28,718
Help! Ohh!

836
00:56:39,896 --> 00:56:42,231
My son. My firstborn.

837
00:56:42,231 --> 00:56:43,982
My son. My firstborn.

838
00:56:44,066 --> 00:56:46,401
Imre.

839
00:56:46,402 --> 00:56:47,736
Imre.

840
00:56:49,906 --> 00:56:52,825
I told him
all about you.

841
00:56:52,909 --> 00:56:54,827
- I wanted him to meet you.
- (Moses laughs)

842
00:56:54,911 --> 00:56:58,039
This is Moses, my brother...

843
00:56:58,122 --> 00:57:00,457
A great, great man.

844
00:57:00,458 --> 00:57:01,876
A great, great man.

845
00:57:07,590 --> 00:57:10,009
Wait for me by the gate.

846
00:57:14,305 --> 00:57:17,641
How much longer
will this torment continue?

847
00:57:17,725 --> 00:57:19,852
Until he frees us.

848
00:57:19,936 --> 00:57:21,854
He'd have had you killed by now.

849
00:57:21,938 --> 00:57:24,857
He knows what your God can do.

850
00:57:24,941 --> 00:57:26,901
He's afraid of his power.

851
00:57:27,026 --> 00:57:29,361
Ramses can put an end to it
at any time.

852
00:57:29,362 --> 00:57:31,489
Ramses can put an end to it
at any time.

853
00:57:31,572 --> 00:57:33,907
A weak man is the worst
for adversaries.

854
00:57:33,908 --> 00:57:35,117
A weak man is the worst
for adversaries.

855
00:57:35,201 --> 00:57:37,912
He mistakes stubbornness
for strength.

856
00:57:38,037 --> 00:57:40,205
He'll fight on when a strong man
would leave the battlefield,

857
00:57:40,289 --> 00:57:42,624
Knowing all is lost.

858
00:57:42,625 --> 00:57:43,792
Knowing all is lost.

859
00:57:43,876 --> 00:57:46,044
You're a stubborn man, too.

860
00:57:46,087 --> 00:57:48,422
Because I know I'll win.
God will win.

861
00:57:48,422 --> 00:57:50,549
Because I know I'll win.
God will win.

862
00:57:50,633 --> 00:57:52,885
And then what?

863
00:57:52,969 --> 00:57:54,762
Ramses will free us.

864
00:57:54,845 --> 00:57:57,180
And what can we do
in the meantime?

865
00:57:57,181 --> 00:57:59,558
And what can we do
in the meantime?

866
00:57:59,642 --> 00:58:00,893
Pray to your gods

867
00:58:00,977 --> 00:58:02,979
that Ramses will spare
your people further suffering.

868
00:58:06,440 --> 00:58:09,317
They were your people, too,
once...

869
00:58:10,987 --> 00:58:13,489
Weren't they?

870
00:58:40,725 --> 00:58:42,810
(shouting)

871
00:58:52,778 --> 00:58:55,113
Get out! Get out!
Come on!

872
00:58:55,114 --> 00:58:57,741
Get out! Get out!
Come on!

873
00:59:00,703 --> 00:59:03,038
Come on, come on, priest.
Get out!

874
00:59:03,039 --> 00:59:04,999
Come on, come on, priest.
Get out!

875
00:59:05,124 --> 00:59:06,125
(groaning)

876
00:59:06,167 --> 00:59:08,502
Get out there!
Now do something!

877
00:59:08,502 --> 00:59:09,836
Get out there!
Now do something!

878
00:59:15,051 --> 00:59:16,302
(screams)

879
00:59:21,223 --> 00:59:24,059
Protect him!

880
00:59:28,230 --> 00:59:30,565
No.

881
00:59:30,566 --> 00:59:32,484
No.

882
00:59:32,568 --> 00:59:34,903
No.

883
00:59:34,904 --> 00:59:36,030
No.

884
00:59:36,155 --> 00:59:39,074
Surrender to a slave...

885
00:59:43,746 --> 00:59:46,415
Is that what you want
your Pharaoh to do?

886
00:59:51,003 --> 00:59:52,004
Aah!

887
00:59:52,088 --> 00:59:54,215
(grunting)

888
00:59:58,719 --> 01:00:01,054
Who else counsels this?
Hmm?

889
01:00:01,055 --> 01:00:03,223
Who else counsels this?
Hmm?

890
01:00:05,768 --> 01:00:08,103
(rumbling)

891
01:00:08,104 --> 01:00:10,272
(rumbling)

892
01:00:10,356 --> 01:00:13,359
(wind howling)

893
01:00:15,986 --> 01:00:18,655
The skies rained down
pestilence and fire,

894
01:00:18,739 --> 01:00:21,366
leaving the Pharaoh
and his sorcerers powerless.

895
01:00:21,450 --> 01:00:24,119
Until the very face
of Ra himself

896
01:00:24,203 --> 01:00:26,538
was hidden from view.

897
01:00:26,539 --> 01:00:28,499
Was hidden from view.

898
01:00:35,381 --> 01:00:37,716
Ah, there. You see?

899
01:00:37,716 --> 01:00:39,342
Ah, there. You see?

900
01:00:39,426 --> 01:00:40,760
It is not possible

901
01:00:40,845 --> 01:00:43,472
For the mighty Egypt
could be destroyed

902
01:00:43,556 --> 01:00:46,141
By this man Moses and his God.

903
01:00:46,225 --> 01:00:48,560
But there are those
who begin to fear it.

904
01:00:48,561 --> 01:00:49,979
But there are those
who begin to fear it.

905
01:00:50,062 --> 01:00:52,564
They say freeing a few slaves

906
01:00:52,648 --> 01:00:55,275
is but a small price to pay.

907
01:00:55,359 --> 01:00:56,610
Shh!

908
01:00:58,904 --> 01:01:00,155
Menerith...

909
01:01:02,283 --> 01:01:04,368
How much longer
can I count on my army?

910
01:01:04,451 --> 01:01:06,786
I'm a soldier.
I'll tell you in plain words.

911
01:01:06,787 --> 01:01:09,498
I'm a soldier.
I'll tell you in plain words.

912
01:01:12,751 --> 01:01:15,879
Men have seen their women
and children go hungry...

913
01:01:15,963 --> 01:01:17,881
seen them fall sick,

914
01:01:17,965 --> 01:01:20,425
seen them lose everything
they have including their faith

915
01:01:20,509 --> 01:01:23,094
in the power of the Pharaoh
to protect them.

916
01:01:23,179 --> 01:01:26,515
- This is blasphemy!
- Silence!

917
01:01:26,599 --> 01:01:29,101
They would rather
have the slaves freed

918
01:01:29,185 --> 01:01:31,770
Than lose
what little they have.

919
01:01:44,450 --> 01:01:46,702
I am Pharaoh.

920
01:01:50,206 --> 01:01:53,375
Centuries look down on me.

921
01:01:57,671 --> 01:02:00,215
I am a god.

922
01:02:11,769 --> 01:02:14,855
I am a god.

923
01:02:37,253 --> 01:02:40,172
No.

924
01:02:40,256 --> 01:02:42,591
No.

925
01:02:42,591 --> 01:02:44,759
No.

926
01:02:44,843 --> 01:02:47,178
I stand firm.
I will not be moved.

927
01:02:47,179 --> 01:02:49,514
I stand firm.
I will not be moved.

928
01:02:49,515 --> 01:02:51,892
I stand firm.
I will not be moved.

929
01:02:55,187 --> 01:02:57,522
I will not sacrifice that much
of what I and my son have.

930
01:02:57,523 --> 01:02:59,858
I will not sacrifice that much
of what I and my son have.

931
01:02:59,858 --> 01:03:02,193
I will not sacrifice that much
of what I and my son have.

932
01:03:02,278 --> 01:03:05,155
Pharaoh!
Pharaoh, years ago,

933
01:03:05,239 --> 01:03:07,199
the previous Pharaoh
had a vision

934
01:03:07,283 --> 01:03:09,201
of a prince of Egypt

935
01:03:09,285 --> 01:03:12,121
who would bring
mortal danger to the kingdom.

936
01:03:12,204 --> 01:03:14,539
Moses is no prince of Egypt.
He's a slave.

937
01:03:14,540 --> 01:03:16,041
Moses is no prince of Egypt.
He's a slave.

938
01:03:16,125 --> 01:03:18,418
No, he's not a slave.

939
01:03:18,502 --> 01:03:21,296
He's my son.

940
01:03:24,466 --> 01:03:26,801
I found him in the river...

941
01:03:26,802 --> 01:03:27,844
I found him in the river...

942
01:03:27,928 --> 01:03:30,263
and I brought him up
as my own child...

943
01:03:30,264 --> 01:03:32,599
and I brought him up
as my own child...

944
01:03:32,599 --> 01:03:34,225
and I brought him up
as my own child...

945
01:03:34,310 --> 01:03:36,312
as a prince of Egypt.

946
01:03:38,063 --> 01:03:40,398
I told the Pharaoh
this prince of Egypt

947
01:03:40,399 --> 01:03:41,983
I told the Pharaoh
this prince of Egypt

948
01:03:42,067 --> 01:03:44,402
Aould bring down
both horse and rider!

949
01:03:44,403 --> 01:03:46,863
Aould bring down
both horse and rider!

950
01:03:46,947 --> 01:03:48,156
Get out!

951
01:03:48,240 --> 01:03:50,575
- Get him out!
- (laughing)

952
01:03:50,576 --> 01:03:52,160
- Get him out!
- (laughing)

953
01:03:52,244 --> 01:03:53,453
Go!

954
01:03:53,537 --> 01:03:56,414
Make him go!

955
01:04:10,137 --> 01:04:11,888
Just the men.

956
01:04:11,972 --> 01:04:14,307
No, the women
and the children, too.

957
01:04:14,308 --> 01:04:15,809
No, the women
and the children, too.

958
01:04:15,893 --> 01:04:17,644
The women,
but not the children?

959
01:04:17,728 --> 01:04:20,147
All, everybody--
the old, the young,

960
01:04:20,230 --> 01:04:21,356
every slave you own.

961
01:04:21,440 --> 01:04:22,524
Not the flocks and herds.

962
01:04:22,608 --> 01:04:23,609
- Yes.
- No.

963
01:04:23,692 --> 01:04:25,735
We leave nothing
that is ours.

964
01:04:25,819 --> 01:04:28,571
That is not for you to say.

965
01:04:28,655 --> 01:04:30,990
No, it's for God,
but he speaks through me.

966
01:04:30,991 --> 01:04:33,451
No, it's for God,
but he speaks through me.

967
01:04:38,707 --> 01:04:40,625
I am Pharaoh.

968
01:04:40,709 --> 01:04:43,920
I am Moses.

969
01:04:58,394 --> 01:05:00,312
I'm willing to bargain.

970
01:05:00,396 --> 01:05:03,524
I am not.

971
01:05:07,403 --> 01:05:09,780
- (shape fingers)
- (man) Guards!

972
01:05:16,412 --> 01:05:18,747
I am the Sun,
the Moon, the Nile.

973
01:05:18,747 --> 01:05:21,416
I am the Sun,
the Moon, the Nile.

974
01:05:21,500 --> 01:05:23,752
I rule in this kingdom...

975
01:05:23,836 --> 01:05:26,964
And I rule
in the life after death.

976
01:05:29,216 --> 01:05:31,551
If this man
enters the palace again,

977
01:05:31,552 --> 01:05:32,970
If this man
enters the palace again,

978
01:05:33,053 --> 01:05:35,055
He is to be killed...

979
01:05:35,139 --> 01:05:37,975
Instantly.

980
01:05:56,076 --> 01:05:59,370
And what now?

981
01:06:02,458 --> 01:06:05,335
What now?

982
01:06:16,305 --> 01:06:19,349
(Moses) Freedom is near...

983
01:06:19,433 --> 01:06:21,393
Very near.

984
01:06:21,477 --> 01:06:23,812
Our God has brought us
this far.

985
01:06:23,812 --> 01:06:26,898
Our God has brought us
this far.

986
01:06:26,982 --> 01:06:29,317
There is only
a little way to go.

987
01:06:29,318 --> 01:06:31,403
There is only
a little way to go.

988
01:06:31,487 --> 01:06:34,823
These are our last hours
as slaves. Remember them.

989
01:06:34,907 --> 01:06:37,701
Tell your children
to tell their children

990
01:06:37,784 --> 01:06:39,702
how bitter
our captivity was.

991
01:06:39,786 --> 01:06:42,497
We must never forget.

992
01:06:45,501 --> 01:06:48,587
Are you ready?

993
01:06:48,629 --> 01:06:49,713
Yes.

994
01:06:49,796 --> 01:06:51,964
Yes!

995
01:06:52,049 --> 01:06:54,384
(all shouting)

996
01:06:54,384 --> 01:06:56,010
(all shouting)

997
01:06:56,094 --> 01:06:58,221
Get ready for a journey.

998
01:06:59,848 --> 01:07:02,392
Roast meat...

999
01:07:02,476 --> 01:07:05,228
bake bread,
eat with the bitter herbs

1000
01:07:05,312 --> 01:07:07,689
that have been all we have had
to savor our food with.

1001
01:07:07,773 --> 01:07:10,108
Be ready to leave
at any moment.

1002
01:07:10,108 --> 01:07:11,400
Be ready to leave
at any moment.

1003
01:07:12,611 --> 01:07:15,238
Smear some of the blood
from your meal

1004
01:07:15,322 --> 01:07:17,615
over the door of your house.
Do not forget that.

1005
01:07:17,699 --> 01:07:19,742
Every door must have
that sign on it.

1006
01:07:19,826 --> 01:07:21,536
It will protect you...

1007
01:07:21,620 --> 01:07:23,830
And then wait.

1008
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:28,334
Wait.

1009
01:07:31,505 --> 01:07:34,257
Wait.

1010
01:07:40,389 --> 01:07:42,724
(wind gusts blowing)

1011
01:07:42,724 --> 01:07:44,350
(wind gusts blowing)

1012
01:07:53,360 --> 01:07:56,529
(goat bleats)

1013
01:08:05,581 --> 01:08:08,458
(coughing)

1014
01:08:10,586 --> 01:08:12,462
Aah!

1015
01:08:12,546 --> 01:08:13,838
(shouts)

1016
01:08:13,922 --> 01:08:15,590
Oh! Oh!

1017
01:08:23,557 --> 01:08:25,892
(boy gasping)

1018
01:08:25,892 --> 01:08:27,393
(boy gasping)

1019
01:08:27,477 --> 01:08:29,520
SETI.

1020
01:08:29,605 --> 01:08:31,773
SETI?

1021
01:08:31,857 --> 01:08:33,692
SETI!

1022
01:08:33,775 --> 01:08:36,110
SETI! SETI, wake up!

1023
01:08:36,111 --> 01:08:37,529
SETI! SETI, wake up!

1024
01:08:37,613 --> 01:08:39,698
SETI!

1025
01:08:39,781 --> 01:08:42,116
SETI! SETI!

1026
01:08:42,117 --> 01:08:44,619
SETI! SETI!

1027
01:09:15,776 --> 01:09:18,820
(Menerith) Moses!

1028
01:09:18,904 --> 01:09:21,865
Moses, my brother!

1029
01:09:21,948 --> 01:09:23,658
Menerith.

1030
01:09:38,674 --> 01:09:41,009
My son was taken, too.

1031
01:09:41,009 --> 01:09:42,093
My son was taken, too.

1032
01:09:42,177 --> 01:09:44,512
I grieve with you.

1033
01:09:44,513 --> 01:09:46,181
I grieve with you.

1034
01:09:46,264 --> 01:09:48,599
You... grieve?

1035
01:09:48,600 --> 01:09:51,686
You... grieve?

1036
01:09:53,939 --> 01:09:56,608
Wasn't this your doing?

1037
01:09:56,692 --> 01:09:59,695
It was God's.

1038
01:10:02,447 --> 01:10:03,948
You willed it.

1039
01:10:06,410 --> 01:10:08,745
Ramses will give you
your freedom now.

1040
01:10:08,745 --> 01:10:09,787
Ramses will give you
your freedom now.

1041
01:10:12,249 --> 01:10:15,168
Your God won.

1042
01:10:19,631 --> 01:10:21,966
I think
your god is a cruel one.

1043
01:10:21,967 --> 01:10:23,218
I think
your god is a cruel one.

1044
01:10:23,301 --> 01:10:25,219
Years ago,

1045
01:10:25,303 --> 01:10:27,638
Pharaoh sent his soldiers
to kill our children.

1046
01:10:27,639 --> 01:10:28,931
Pharaoh sent his soldiers
to kill our children.

1047
01:10:31,351 --> 01:10:33,686
I wasn't among them.

1048
01:10:33,687 --> 01:10:36,272
I wasn't among them.

1049
01:10:36,356 --> 01:10:38,691
My son wasn't there.

1050
01:10:38,692 --> 01:10:40,276
My son wasn't there.

1051
01:10:40,360 --> 01:10:42,695
Why should we be punished?

1052
01:10:42,696 --> 01:10:43,822
Why should we be punished?

1053
01:10:43,905 --> 01:10:46,240
I do what God tells me.

1054
01:10:46,241 --> 01:10:47,283
I do what God tells me.

1055
01:10:47,367 --> 01:10:49,702
If he told you to kill me...

1056
01:10:49,703 --> 01:10:51,705
If he told you to kill me...

1057
01:10:53,039 --> 01:10:55,041
would you do it?

1058
01:10:58,754 --> 01:11:01,089
Would you?

1059
01:11:01,089 --> 01:11:02,423
Would you?

1060
01:11:04,301 --> 01:11:06,303
Yes.

1061
01:11:06,386 --> 01:11:08,721
The men and the women
and the children.

1062
01:11:08,722 --> 01:11:11,474
The men and the women
and the children.

1063
01:11:11,558 --> 01:11:13,142
Yes.

1064
01:11:13,226 --> 01:11:15,561
With all
their flocks and herds.

1065
01:11:15,562 --> 01:11:18,565
With all
their flocks and herds.

1066
01:11:18,648 --> 01:11:21,692
Yes.

1067
01:11:21,777 --> 01:11:24,696
Before they leave,
their masters and mistresses

1068
01:11:24,780 --> 01:11:27,407
will give them
gold and silver...

1069
01:11:27,491 --> 01:11:28,492
No.

1070
01:11:28,575 --> 01:11:30,910
As tribute for their labor
of 400 years.

1071
01:11:30,911 --> 01:11:32,787
As tribute for their labor
of 400 years.

1072
01:11:40,754 --> 01:11:43,006
Yes.

1073
01:11:51,807 --> 01:11:54,184
(Bit hi a)
Menerith won't see you.

1074
01:11:54,267 --> 01:11:56,727
He's still grieving
for his son...

1075
01:11:56,812 --> 01:11:58,814
for my grandson.

1076
01:11:58,897 --> 01:12:01,691
I can't pretend
to understand.

1077
01:12:01,775 --> 01:12:04,110
Sometimes I think I don't know
who you are anymore.

1078
01:12:04,110 --> 01:12:05,986
Sometimes I think I don't know
who you are anymore.

1079
01:12:06,071 --> 01:12:08,406
Perhaps I never did.

1080
01:12:08,406 --> 01:12:09,740
Perhaps I never did.

1081
01:12:09,825 --> 01:12:13,036
All I know
is that I love you.

1082
01:12:13,119 --> 01:12:15,454
You're my son, too,

1083
01:12:15,455 --> 01:12:18,749
You're my son, too,

1084
01:12:18,834 --> 01:12:21,169
and I'll never stop
loving you.

1085
01:12:21,169 --> 01:12:23,087
And I'll never stop
loving you.

1086
01:12:24,840 --> 01:12:26,842
Will I ever see you again?

1087
01:12:29,135 --> 01:12:31,470
Will your God
let me see you again?

1088
01:12:31,471 --> 01:12:32,805
Will your God
let me see you again?

1089
01:12:43,859 --> 01:12:46,194
(crying)

1090
01:12:46,194 --> 01:12:47,778
(crying)

1091
01:12:47,863 --> 01:12:50,782
It's time!
We're leaving quickly! Hurry!

1092
01:12:50,866 --> 01:12:53,577
It's time! Now!

1093
01:12:53,660 --> 01:12:56,204
Now! We're leaving!
Now, now, now!

1094
01:12:56,288 --> 01:12:57,747
We're leaving!
Come on, quickly!

1095
01:12:57,831 --> 01:12:59,833
(man) This way!

1096
01:13:19,144 --> 01:13:21,479
You brought us here...

1097
01:13:21,479 --> 01:13:22,813
You brought us here...

1098
01:13:22,898 --> 01:13:25,233
and the Egyptians
betrayed us.

1099
01:13:25,233 --> 01:13:27,360
And the Egyptians
betrayed us.

1100
01:13:27,444 --> 01:13:29,779
Now I'm taking them back
to the only place I can...

1101
01:13:29,779 --> 01:13:31,822
Now I'm taking them back
to the only place I can...

1102
01:13:31,907 --> 01:13:34,868
The desert.

1103
01:13:50,342 --> 01:13:51,801
What are you doing?

1104
01:13:51,885 --> 01:13:53,595
You can't disturb
Joseph's grave.

1105
01:13:53,678 --> 01:13:55,888
- This is sacrilege.
- We're his tribe,

1106
01:13:56,014 --> 01:13:58,016
Not the Egyptians.
He belongs with us.

1107
01:14:05,190 --> 01:14:06,691
(cheering)

1108
01:14:08,193 --> 01:14:10,195
Keep them moving.
We're not safe yet.

1109
01:14:10,278 --> 01:14:12,488
He could still
change his mind. Come on.

1110
01:15:27,647 --> 01:15:30,232
(crowd speaking indistinctly)

1111
01:15:30,316 --> 01:15:33,235
(man) After 400 years!

1112
01:15:34,904 --> 01:15:38,115
(woman) Oh, my God,
we've made it.

1113
01:15:38,199 --> 01:15:40,534
(man) Follow Moses!

1114
01:15:40,535 --> 01:15:42,161
(man) Follow Moses!

1115
01:15:55,341 --> 01:15:58,635
Where do we go, Moses?
Which way?

1116
01:15:58,720 --> 01:16:00,680
The Promised Land--
where is it?

1117
01:16:00,764 --> 01:16:02,974
How do we get to it?

1118
01:16:03,058 --> 01:16:04,976
How long will it take?

1119
01:16:05,060 --> 01:16:07,812
How will we live
till we get there?

1120
01:16:09,606 --> 01:16:12,609
(wind howling)

1121
01:16:15,070 --> 01:16:17,614
There.

1122
01:17:05,036 --> 01:17:07,747
My son.

1123
01:17:10,708 --> 01:17:14,044
My little boy.

1124
01:17:14,129 --> 01:17:16,131
No.

1125
01:17:49,455 --> 01:17:52,624
You lost your son, too.

1126
01:17:59,174 --> 01:18:02,385
Had we known Moses'...

1127
01:18:07,307 --> 01:18:10,143
Brother.

1128
01:18:13,897 --> 01:18:16,274
Who are you?

1129
01:18:29,495 --> 01:18:32,623
Menerith...

1130
01:18:32,707 --> 01:18:35,292
Fight.

1131
01:18:37,962 --> 01:18:40,047
Fight!

1132
01:18:49,098 --> 01:18:52,101
(horses neighing)

1133
01:18:54,854 --> 01:18:57,523
Whoa.

1134
01:19:02,403 --> 01:19:05,322
Go back. Tell Pharaoh.

1135
01:19:59,585 --> 01:20:02,087
(man) Pharaoh!

1136
01:20:07,218 --> 01:20:08,219
(yells command)

1137
01:20:08,303 --> 01:20:09,846
(man responds to command)

1138
01:20:22,483 --> 01:20:24,318
(neighs)

1139
01:20:47,967 --> 01:20:50,260
Onward!

1140
01:20:50,345 --> 01:20:53,639
(men shouting)

1141
01:20:53,723 --> 01:20:56,726
(screaming)

1142
01:21:29,592 --> 01:21:31,927
Come on!

1143
01:21:31,928 --> 01:21:33,220
Come on!

1144
01:21:39,769 --> 01:21:41,270
Here!

1145
01:21:41,354 --> 01:21:43,522
We stop here!

1146
01:21:43,606 --> 01:21:44,607
You fool!

1147
01:21:44,690 --> 01:21:46,233
We're trapped.

1148
01:21:46,317 --> 01:21:48,027
- You've lead us into a trap.
- What kind of leader are you?

1149
01:21:48,111 --> 01:21:50,780
- You'll have us killed, all of us!
- Enough!

1150
01:21:59,872 --> 01:22:02,207
(seagulls squawking)

1151
01:22:02,208 --> 01:22:03,334
(seagulls squawking)

1152
01:22:04,961 --> 01:22:07,630
Moses...

1153
01:22:11,300 --> 01:22:13,635
You know my voice?

1154
01:22:13,636 --> 01:22:14,803
You know my voice?

1155
01:22:14,887 --> 01:22:16,763
Yes.

1156
01:22:16,848 --> 01:22:19,559
You know who I am?

1157
01:22:19,642 --> 01:22:20,726
Yes.

1158
01:22:20,810 --> 01:22:22,520
Do you trust me?

1159
01:22:22,603 --> 01:22:24,938
Yes. Yes.

1160
01:22:24,939 --> 01:22:27,816
Yes. Yes.

1161
01:22:27,900 --> 01:22:29,735
(shouting and screaming)

1162
01:22:29,819 --> 01:22:32,071
(man) Come on!

1163
01:22:49,464 --> 01:22:51,466
(neighs)

1164
01:22:52,925 --> 01:22:55,010
Yah!

1165
01:23:38,513 --> 01:23:40,515
(thunder crashing)

1166
01:24:11,128 --> 01:24:13,463
- Oh!
- (thunder crashing)

1167
01:24:13,464 --> 01:24:14,548
- Oh!
- (thunder crashing)

1168
01:24:20,930 --> 01:24:23,641
This is witchcraft.

1169
01:24:23,683 --> 01:24:25,393
It must be.

1170
01:24:25,476 --> 01:24:27,478
Or God's word.

1171
01:24:27,562 --> 01:24:30,481
I say witchcraft!

1172
01:24:30,565 --> 01:24:32,900
No, it's the only way to escape.

1173
01:24:32,900 --> 01:24:34,568
No, it's the only way to escape.

1174
01:24:39,448 --> 01:24:41,908
(shouting)

1175
01:24:41,993 --> 01:24:44,328
(man) Hurry!

1176
01:24:44,328 --> 01:24:45,370
(man) Hurry!

1177
01:24:47,582 --> 01:24:49,542
Oh!

1178
01:24:57,967 --> 01:24:59,510
(man) Come on, come on!

1179
01:24:59,594 --> 01:25:01,929
Keep going! Keep going!

1180
01:25:01,929 --> 01:25:04,598
Keep going! Keep going!

1181
01:25:10,146 --> 01:25:12,523
(man) Come on!

1182
01:25:12,607 --> 01:25:14,025
Come on!

1183
01:25:38,633 --> 01:25:40,468
(baby cries)

1184
01:25:43,596 --> 01:25:45,931
Keep moving.
Keep moving. Hurry!

1185
01:25:45,931 --> 01:25:48,099
Keep moving.
Keep moving. Hurry!

1186
01:25:49,268 --> 01:25:52,562
I'm coming.

1187
01:25:52,647 --> 01:25:54,982
Aaron, don't be afraid.

1188
01:25:54,982 --> 01:25:57,275
Aaron, don't be afraid.

1189
01:26:16,671 --> 01:26:19,006
Keep going! Go!
Keep going!

1190
01:26:19,006 --> 01:26:20,340
Keep going! Go!
Keep going!

1191
01:26:20,424 --> 01:26:21,925
(woman screams)

1192
01:26:25,930 --> 01:26:28,349
Keep going! Have faith!

1193
01:26:28,432 --> 01:26:30,225
Hurry!

1194
01:26:34,105 --> 01:26:36,607
(horses neighing)

1195
01:26:36,691 --> 01:26:38,693
Moses!

1196
01:26:40,361 --> 01:26:42,696
See to the others.

1197
01:28:34,391 --> 01:28:36,184
(horse neighs)

1198
01:28:52,076 --> 01:28:54,286
They're slaves!

1199
01:28:54,370 --> 01:28:57,414
They're unarmed!

1200
01:28:59,834 --> 01:29:01,669
Go!

1201
01:29:01,752 --> 01:29:03,378
(all yelling)

1202
01:29:03,462 --> 01:29:05,714
Go! Come on!

1203
01:29:10,511 --> 01:29:12,930
Go! Go, quickly!

1204
01:29:18,477 --> 01:29:19,769
(man) Hyah!

1205
01:29:19,854 --> 01:29:22,606
Hyah! Hyah! Hyah!

1206
01:29:29,697 --> 01:29:31,824
(man) Must endure!

1207
01:29:31,949 --> 01:29:34,743
Keep moving!
Don't look back at them!

1208
01:29:34,827 --> 01:29:36,119
Keep going!

1209
01:29:36,203 --> 01:29:38,121
Come on! Don't look back!

1210
01:29:38,205 --> 01:29:40,290
Trust in your God!
Keep moving!

1211
01:29:54,889 --> 01:29:57,433
Don't look back!
Don't look back!

1212
01:29:57,516 --> 01:29:59,351
(neighing)

1213
01:29:59,435 --> 01:30:01,770
Come on! Come on!

1214
01:30:01,770 --> 01:30:02,979
Come on! Come on!

1215
01:30:03,063 --> 01:30:05,440
Come on! Hyah!

1216
01:30:13,532 --> 01:30:14,991
Save yourself, brother.

1217
01:30:29,924 --> 01:30:31,467
(all yelling)

1218
01:32:06,020 --> 01:32:08,147
Have them collect
all the weapons.

1219
01:32:08,230 --> 01:32:11,024
We still may need them.

1220
01:33:07,956 --> 01:33:10,959
(sobbing)

1221
01:33:26,975 --> 01:33:28,851
Moses!

1222
01:33:28,936 --> 01:33:30,187
Moses!

1223
01:33:30,229 --> 01:33:33,398
Everyone is celebrating.

1224
01:33:59,800 --> 01:34:03,053
So what now?

1225
01:34:03,137 --> 01:34:04,763
I don't know.

1226
01:34:04,847 --> 01:34:07,099
Well,
where do we go?

1227
01:34:07,224 --> 01:34:09,559
Well, we need water.
We'll find a spring somewhere.

1228
01:34:09,560 --> 01:34:11,895
Well, we need water.
We'll find a spring somewhere.

1229
01:34:11,895 --> 01:34:12,979
Well, we need water.
We'll find a spring somewhere.

1230
01:34:13,063 --> 01:34:15,398
But after that?

1231
01:34:15,399 --> 01:34:16,900
But after that?

1232
01:34:16,984 --> 01:34:18,235
We'll find another,

1233
01:34:18,318 --> 01:34:20,570
and then a way to feed them
once the bread runs out.

1234
01:34:20,654 --> 01:34:23,698
What happens to us now?
Now we are free.

1235
01:34:23,782 --> 01:34:26,367
We stay together, and then
we wait for God to tell us

1236
01:34:26,451 --> 01:34:28,953
When to go to the land
he's promised us.

1237
01:34:39,381 --> 01:34:41,132
What are you doing?

1238
01:34:41,258 --> 01:34:42,968
(goats bleating)

1239
01:34:43,051 --> 01:34:46,137
I'm going to find grazing,
water and food for my family.

1240
01:34:46,263 --> 01:34:47,597
By yourself?

1241
01:34:47,681 --> 01:34:50,266
- Why not?
- No.

1242
01:34:50,309 --> 01:34:52,102
We stay together.

1243
01:34:52,186 --> 01:34:54,813
Because you say so?

1244
01:34:54,897 --> 01:34:58,191
Because God
has a plan for us.

1245
01:35:12,581 --> 01:35:15,333
There behind you lies Egypt.

1246
01:35:15,417 --> 01:35:17,794
So there's no going back
that way.

1247
01:35:17,878 --> 01:35:20,922
So it has to be the desert.

1248
01:35:21,006 --> 01:35:23,341
We have bread for many days,
but water for only a few.

1249
01:35:23,342 --> 01:35:24,509
We have bread for many days,
but water for only a few.

1250
01:35:24,593 --> 01:35:26,928
We've no tents,
no means of sheltering

1251
01:35:26,929 --> 01:35:28,305
We've no tents,
no means of sheltering

1252
01:35:28,347 --> 01:35:30,307
Against the cold
of the night.

1253
01:35:30,349 --> 01:35:33,143
None of you know
how to live in the desert.

1254
01:35:33,227 --> 01:35:35,145
Most of you are scared of it.

1255
01:35:35,229 --> 01:35:37,147
I was, too,
when I first came here,

1256
01:35:37,231 --> 01:35:39,566
But I learned to live in it,
and so will you.

1257
01:35:39,566 --> 01:35:41,150
But I learned to live in it,
and so will you.

1258
01:35:41,235 --> 01:35:43,570
Abraham was a nomad!
So were Isaac and Jacob!

1259
01:35:43,570 --> 01:35:45,572
Abraham was a nomad!
So were Isaac and Jacob!

1260
01:35:45,656 --> 01:35:48,325
The desert's in our blood.

1261
01:35:48,367 --> 01:35:50,702
We should be at home here
if anyone is.

1262
01:35:50,702 --> 01:35:52,245
We should be at home here
if anyone is.

1263

<i>383</i>

1264
01:36:00,003 --> 01:36:02,797
(man) So these
newly freed slaves set out

1265
01:36:02,881 --> 01:36:05,466
on one of mankind's
epic journeys

1266
01:36:05,550 --> 01:36:07,260
led by a man
who many of them believe

1267
01:36:07,344 --> 01:36:09,721
wasn't even truly
one of them,

1268
01:36:09,805 --> 01:36:12,140
each step taking them further
into the unknown.

1269
01:36:12,140 --> 01:36:13,808
Each step taking them further
into the unknown.

1270
01:36:56,101 --> 01:36:57,393
(spits)

1271
01:37:10,866 --> 01:37:12,325
Put it down.

1272
01:37:12,409 --> 01:37:14,411
You'd make him
give up his life for yours?

1273
01:37:14,494 --> 01:37:16,412
It's you
who's risking his life--

1274
01:37:16,496 --> 01:37:18,080
Risking all our lives.

1275
01:37:18,165 --> 01:37:20,041
What should we do...

1276
01:37:20,125 --> 01:37:22,210
Go back to Egypt...

1277
01:37:22,294 --> 01:37:24,296
Beg to be slaves again?

1278
01:37:24,421 --> 01:37:26,756
By day, we scorch to death.
By night, we freeze.

1279
01:37:26,757 --> 01:37:28,508
By day, we scorch to death.
By night, we freeze.

1280
01:37:28,592 --> 01:37:30,302
How many of us will be left

1281
01:37:30,427 --> 01:37:32,595
by the time you know
where you're leading us?

1282
01:37:32,679 --> 01:37:34,972
Nobody has
to burn or freeze,

1283
01:37:35,057 --> 01:37:36,975
but they have to work.

1284
01:37:37,059 --> 01:37:39,269
Slaves have always
had masters to rely upon.

1285
01:37:39,353 --> 01:37:41,438
They'll bow their backs
as long as their owner

1286
01:37:41,521 --> 01:37:44,232
gives them a few racks
to put on it...

1287
01:37:44,316 --> 01:37:46,651
tosses them scraps of food,
tells them what to do.

1288
01:37:46,651 --> 01:37:47,818
Tosses them scraps of food,
tells them what to do.

1289
01:37:47,903 --> 01:37:49,905
I don't want to be
a slave again.

1290
01:37:49,988 --> 01:37:52,198
Then start acting
like a free man.

1291
01:37:52,282 --> 01:37:54,242
Take care of yourself,

1292
01:37:54,326 --> 01:37:56,661
And don't take
what doesn't belong to you.

1293
01:37:56,661 --> 01:37:58,996
And don't take
what doesn't belong to you.

1294
01:38:08,090 --> 01:38:09,132
(man) No...

1295
01:38:09,216 --> 01:38:11,343
Not yet.

1296
01:38:21,269 --> 01:38:23,229
They're right
to question me.

1297
01:38:23,313 --> 01:38:25,315
I brought them here,

1298
01:38:25,399 --> 01:38:27,401
but I don't know
where to go next.

1299
01:38:27,484 --> 01:38:29,819
Can't you tell me?

1300
01:38:29,820 --> 01:38:31,696
Can't you tell me?

1301
01:38:31,780 --> 01:38:34,073
Have it your way.
Make me work it out for myself.

1302
01:38:34,157 --> 01:38:36,784
Maybe you're having doubts
about having chosen me.

1303
01:38:36,868 --> 01:38:39,704
I'm not clever enough or brave
enough or strong enough.

1304
01:38:39,788 --> 01:38:42,123
If that's it, it's fine by me.
I never asked to lead them.

1305
01:38:42,124 --> 01:38:45,210
If that's it, it's fine by me.
I never asked to lead them.

1306
01:38:45,293 --> 01:38:47,336
"I Am Who I Am."
What does that mean?

1307
01:38:47,421 --> 01:38:49,423
Why give me a riddle to solve?

1308
01:38:49,506 --> 01:38:51,883
What is it that you're trying
to get me to see?

1309
01:38:51,967 --> 01:38:54,678
(bird's wings flapping)

1310
01:38:54,761 --> 01:38:56,262
(gasps)

1311
01:39:02,727 --> 01:39:05,187
Your brother
is a remarkable man.

1312
01:39:05,272 --> 01:39:07,607
As remarkable as you.

1313
01:39:07,607 --> 01:39:09,317
As remarkable as you.

1314
01:39:09,401 --> 01:39:12,320
God speaks to him,

1315
01:39:12,404 --> 01:39:14,322
and he speaks to God.

1316
01:39:14,406 --> 01:39:16,825
I'm talking about
your other brother.

1317
01:39:16,908 --> 01:39:19,410
This man Moses
walks in from the desert

1318
01:39:19,536 --> 01:39:21,871
and says God has chosen him,
and Aaron follows blindly,

1319
01:39:21,872 --> 01:39:23,123
and says God has chosen him,
and Aaron follows blindly,

1320
01:39:23,206 --> 01:39:25,541
without any questions,
just as you do.

1321
01:39:25,584 --> 01:39:27,127
Such love and devotion,

1322
01:39:27,210 --> 01:39:30,421
such putting oneself aside
for somebody else.

1323
01:39:30,547 --> 01:39:33,466
It's rare, even between
brothers and sisters.

1324
01:39:33,550 --> 01:39:35,635
Don't you believe
he talks to God?

1325
01:39:35,719 --> 01:39:37,262
I believe he believes that.

1326
01:39:37,345 --> 01:39:39,972
And that God speaks to him?

1327
01:39:40,056 --> 01:39:42,058
He believes that, too.

1328
01:39:42,142 --> 01:39:44,853
But even you
have to take his word for it.

1329
01:39:44,936 --> 01:39:46,854
It's not just his word.

1330
01:39:46,938 --> 01:39:49,440
We've seen
God working through him.

1331
01:39:49,566 --> 01:39:51,568
Wasn't Aaron at his side?

1332
01:39:51,610 --> 01:39:54,446
Didn't you lead the people
into the sea?

1333
01:39:57,657 --> 01:40:00,368
God spoke to him--

1334
01:40:00,452 --> 01:40:03,371
Not to me, not to Aaron.

1335
01:40:03,455 --> 01:40:05,373
Perhaps
he's trying to do that.

1336
01:40:05,457 --> 01:40:07,375
It's just that
you won't listen

1337
01:40:07,459 --> 01:40:10,795
because Moses has convinced you,
as he's convinced us all...

1338
01:40:10,879 --> 01:40:12,422
that he's the one.

1339
01:40:12,506 --> 01:40:15,842
But he is the one.

1340
01:40:15,926 --> 01:40:17,928
We all know that.

1341
01:40:20,430 --> 01:40:22,265
Don't we?

1342
01:40:30,398 --> 01:40:33,317
We know that
he tells us he is.

1343
01:40:40,992 --> 01:40:43,911
A knife may be quicker,
but poison is more certain,

1344
01:40:43,995 --> 01:40:46,664
and the best poison of all
is jealousy.

We can't drink this.

This is unbearable.
We're going to perish here.

All this way,
and for what?

1353
01:41:42,137 --> 01:41:43,680
It's not fit to drink.

1354

It's poisoned.

1355
01:41:45,140 --> 01:41:46,808
Why have you done this
to us?

1356
01:41:46,891 --> 01:41:48,893
You told us
there was water here.

1357
01:41:48,977 --> 01:41:50,436
We need water and food.

1358
01:41:50,520 --> 01:41:51,812
If we were gonna die
of hunger and thirst,

1359
01:41:51,896 --> 01:41:53,814
We could've done it
back in Egypt.

1360
01:41:53,898 --> 01:41:55,232
You nearly did. Remember?

1361
01:41:55,317 --> 01:41:57,319
And you prayed to God
to save you,

1362
01:41:57,402 --> 01:41:58,528
And he answered your prayers
and brought you here.

1363
01:41:58,612 --> 01:42:00,947
- To die anyway?
- You think that's what he wants?

1364
01:42:00,947 --> 01:42:02,031
- To die anyway?
- You think that's what he wants?

I don't know.

1366
01:42:03,992 --> 01:42:05,576
I just know that

01:42:05,702 --> 01:42:08,037
My children are sicker now
than they were in Egypt.

1368
01:42:08,038 --> 01:42:09,914
My children are sicker now
than they were in Egypt.

1369
01:42:09,998 --> 01:42:12,333
At least there
they had water to drink.

1370
01:42:12,417 --> 01:42:13,751
They have water here.

01:42:13,835 --> 01:42:16,295
It's poisoned!

1372
01:42:17,881 --> 01:42:19,299
Moses knows the desert,

1373
01:42:19,382 --> 01:42:22,468
and he'll take us
to sweet water.

1374
01:42:22,552 --> 01:42:25,721
To the next spring?
And how far away is that?

How can we last
that long?

01:45:44,170 --> 01:45:45,588
(goats bleating)

1425
01:45:45,672 --> 01:45:48,633
Come on, come on,
come on.

1426
01:45:48,716 --> 01:45:51,343
(laughter)

1427
01:46:41,352 --> 01:46:43,687
Don't worry.
God will provide...

1428
01:46:43,688 --> 01:46:46,232
Don't worry.
God will provide...

1429
01:46:54,032 --> 01:46:57,076
Won't you?

1430
01:47:24,771 --> 01:47:27,106
Look! Look!

1431
01:47:27,106 --> 01:47:29,358
Look! Look!

1432
01:47:29,442 --> 01:47:31,026
(woman) What is it?

1433
01:47:31,110 --> 01:47:33,904
(people speaking indistinctly)

1434
01:47:39,327 --> 01:47:41,495
There's food for all!

1435
01:47:41,579 --> 01:47:44,331
Eat!

1436
01:47:44,415 --> 01:47:46,041
Eat!

1437
01:47:48,127 --> 01:47:51,380
God will send you as much
as you need every day...

1438
01:47:51,464 --> 01:47:53,799
No more and no less.

1439
01:47:53,800 --> 01:47:55,176
No more and no less.

1440
01:47:55,259 --> 01:47:57,261
(all cheering)

1441
01:48:06,354 --> 01:48:08,189
Didn't I just tell you
he'll send you

1442
01:48:08,272 --> 01:48:11,191
As much as you need every day?
If you store it,

1443
01:48:11,275 --> 01:48:14,528
that means you have no faith
in him keeping his word.

1444
01:48:17,699 --> 01:48:20,326
(gasps)

1445
01:48:20,410 --> 01:48:22,328
Believe in him.

1446
01:48:22,412 --> 01:48:24,789
That's all you have to do.

1447
01:48:24,872 --> 01:48:27,374
If you do that,
then he will take care of you,

1448
01:48:27,458 --> 01:48:29,751
And we won't
ever go hungry again...

1449
01:48:29,836 --> 01:48:32,839
Or thirsty.

1450
01:48:38,302 --> 01:48:40,679
(cheering)

1451
01:48:40,763 --> 01:48:42,765
Maybe they will
believe in you now.

1452
01:48:42,849 --> 01:48:44,767
I'm not so sure.
In a few days,

1453
01:48:44,851 --> 01:48:47,436
they'll be complaining that
they have to bend to pick it up.

1454
01:48:47,520 --> 01:48:48,896
(laughs)

1455
01:48:48,980 --> 01:48:50,690
(laughs)

1456
01:48:59,115 --> 01:49:01,450
There's something
I have to show you. Come.

1457
01:49:01,451 --> 01:49:03,119
There's something
I have to show you. Come.

1458
01:49:13,755 --> 01:49:15,298
Amalekites.

1459
01:49:15,381 --> 01:49:17,674
This can't go on.

1460
01:49:17,759 --> 01:49:19,969
We must protect our people.

1461
01:49:39,280 --> 01:49:41,615
I didn't train
as a soldier...

1462
01:49:41,616 --> 01:49:43,367
I didn't train
as a soldier...

1463
01:49:43,451 --> 01:49:44,827
nor did Aaron,

1464
01:49:44,911 --> 01:49:47,622
but we have to learn
how to fight--

1465
01:49:47,705 --> 01:49:50,040
All of us.

1466
01:49:50,041 --> 01:49:52,168
All of us.

1467
01:50:19,362 --> 01:50:20,654
(laughter)

1468
01:50:20,738 --> 01:50:22,656
No, no, not like that.
Swing first

1469
01:50:22,740 --> 01:50:25,701
And move your head down below.
That's it. Back to the body.

1470
01:50:50,726 --> 01:50:53,854
Pick up your sword.

1471
01:50:53,938 --> 01:50:55,105
No.

1472
01:50:55,231 --> 01:50:57,066
Pick it up.

1473
01:50:57,150 --> 01:50:59,819
No.

1474
01:51:03,990 --> 01:51:06,993
When God
parted the seas for us,

1475
01:51:07,076 --> 01:51:09,411
He did it
because we believed in him.

1476
01:51:09,412 --> 01:51:10,454
He did it
because we believed in him.

1477
01:51:10,538 --> 01:51:13,290
He sent food
and water to us.

1478
01:51:13,374 --> 01:51:16,251
We were thirsty
and starving.

1479
01:51:16,294 --> 01:51:18,587
If we choose to fight,

1480
01:51:18,671 --> 01:51:21,632
He'll think
we've lost that faith.

1481
01:51:24,927 --> 01:51:26,803
What's your name?

1482
01:51:26,888 --> 01:51:29,807
Joshua.

1483
01:51:29,891 --> 01:51:32,476
God won't fight
all our battles for us, Joshua.

1484
01:51:32,560 --> 01:51:34,186
I wish he would.

1485
01:51:34,270 --> 01:51:36,730
So much easier if he did,

1486
01:51:36,814 --> 01:51:39,399
but this time,
we have to do that ourselves.

1487
01:51:39,483 --> 01:51:41,276
And that means everyone.

1488
01:51:41,319 --> 01:51:43,654
When the time comes,
God will help us.

1489
01:51:43,654 --> 01:51:45,280
When the time comes,
God will help us.

1490
01:51:45,323 --> 01:51:48,534
To stop him doing that
is an insult to him.

1491
01:51:54,999 --> 01:51:57,334
There was a man whose house
was threatened by a flood...

1492
01:51:57,335 --> 01:51:59,086
There was a man whose house
was threatened by a flood...

1493
01:51:59,170 --> 01:52:02,089
When his neighbor left, he said
he should come with him.

1494
01:52:02,173 --> 01:52:04,508
"No," he said.
"I'm waiting for God's help.”

1495
01:52:04,508 --> 01:52:06,301
"No," he said.
"I'm waiting for God's help.”

1496
01:52:06,344 --> 01:52:08,679
The water kept rising.

1497
01:52:08,679 --> 01:52:10,389
The water kept rising.

1498
01:52:10,473 --> 01:52:12,391
A man on a camel
called to him.

1499
01:52:12,475 --> 01:52:14,393
"Jump on," he said.
"Save yourself."

1500
01:52:14,477 --> 01:52:17,771
"No, I'm waiting
for God's help."

1501
01:52:17,855 --> 01:52:20,190
The water rose to his roof.

1502
01:52:20,191 --> 01:52:21,692
The water rose to his roof.

1503
01:52:21,776 --> 01:52:24,403
A man in a boat came by.
He refused to get in it.

1504
01:52:24,487 --> 01:52:27,323
"I'm waiting
for God's help."

1505
01:52:27,406 --> 01:52:29,741
He drowned.

1506
01:52:29,742 --> 01:52:32,327
He drowned.

1507
01:52:32,370 --> 01:52:34,705
He was very angry when
he came face to face with God.

1508
01:52:34,705 --> 01:52:36,373
He was very angry when
he came face to face with God.

1509
01:52:36,457 --> 01:52:38,792
"Why didn't you save me?!"
he asked.

1510
01:52:38,793 --> 01:52:41,212
"Why didn't you save me?!"
he asked.

1511
01:52:41,337 --> 01:52:43,672
God said,
"I sent you the neighbor,

1512
01:52:43,673 --> 01:52:45,091
God said,
"I sent you the neighbor,

1513
01:52:45,174 --> 01:52:47,509
"I sent you the camel,
and I sent you the boat.

1514
01:52:47,510 --> 01:52:48,636
"I sent you the camel,
and I sent you the boat.

1515
01:52:48,719 --> 01:52:51,680
"What more did you want?"

1516
01:52:51,764 --> 01:52:54,099
I'm doing what you told us to--
trusting God.

1517
01:52:54,100 --> 01:52:55,518
I'm doing what you told us to--
trusting God.

1518
01:52:55,601 --> 01:52:57,686
I won't insult him and fight.

1519
01:52:57,770 --> 01:53:00,522
Insult him by protecting
yourself and your people?

1520
01:53:00,606 --> 01:53:02,733
Leave him be.

1521
01:53:02,817 --> 01:53:05,152
He's still thinking
like a slave.

1522
01:53:05,152 --> 01:53:07,404
He's still thinking
like a slave.

1523
01:53:07,488 --> 01:53:10,657
When someone strikes a slave,
they cower and beg,

1524
01:53:10,741 --> 01:53:13,535
"Please don't hit me again.”

1525
01:53:13,619 --> 01:53:16,788
They wring their hands
and keep their back bent,

1526
01:53:16,872 --> 01:53:19,374
even while they're
being beaten to death.

1527
01:53:21,711 --> 01:53:23,462
Broken man...

1528
01:53:23,546 --> 01:53:25,673
A man with pride...

1529
01:53:25,756 --> 01:53:28,091
Pride in himself
and his family and his tribe!

1530
01:53:28,092 --> 01:53:30,427
Pride in himself
and his family and his tribe!

1531
01:53:30,428 --> 01:53:31,887
Pride in himself
and his family and his tribe!

1532
01:53:31,971 --> 01:53:34,306
He says,
"Touch me, and you die."

1533
01:53:34,307 --> 01:53:35,850
He says,
"Touch me, and you die."

1534
01:53:51,073 --> 01:53:53,784
I think maybe
you might have

1535
01:53:53,868 --> 01:53:55,870
the makings
of a warrior after all.

1536
01:54:12,261 --> 01:54:14,179
(yelling)

1537
01:54:14,263 --> 01:54:16,431
Slay them all!

1538
01:54:16,515 --> 01:54:18,767
(grunting)

1539
01:54:23,314 --> 01:54:26,025
Aah!

1540
01:54:32,823 --> 01:54:35,242
They're ready.

1541
01:54:35,326 --> 01:54:37,995
Ready, yes,
first for the Amalekites,

1542
01:54:38,079 --> 01:54:39,955
And then for you.

1543
01:54:40,039 --> 01:54:42,875
We can't afford
to risk you in battle.

1544
01:54:42,958 --> 01:54:45,001
Nor you...

1545
01:54:45,086 --> 01:54:47,922
but I know
who should lead them.

1546
01:55:23,791 --> 01:55:25,709
We can't take the village,

1547
01:55:25,793 --> 01:55:27,961
And we can't attack
their army head on.

1548
01:55:28,045 --> 01:55:30,380
We have to ask ourselves,
how do they see us?

1549
01:55:30,381 --> 01:55:32,508
We have to ask ourselves,
how do they see us?

1550
01:55:32,550 --> 01:55:35,678
Who do they think we are?

1551
01:55:35,761 --> 01:55:38,930
Ex-slaves who can't
or won't fight.

1552
01:55:39,014 --> 01:55:41,349
That's right.
What do they want from us?

1553
01:55:41,350 --> 01:55:43,769
That's right.
What do they want from us?

1554
01:55:43,853 --> 01:55:46,522
They wanna steal our flocks,
kill the men and boys

1555
01:55:46,564 --> 01:55:48,232
And take all our women
as slaves.

1556
01:55:48,315 --> 01:55:51,568
So we use that against them.

1557
01:55:51,652 --> 01:55:53,987
(Moses) There won't be
any miracles today.

1558
01:55:53,988 --> 01:55:55,781
(Moses) There won't be
any miracles today.

1559
01:55:55,865 --> 01:55:58,200
Today, he's testing us.

1560
01:55:58,200 --> 01:55:59,409
Today, he's testing us.

1561
01:55:59,535 --> 01:56:01,870
We want the sea to part.
If we want the rock to split,

1562
01:56:01,871 --> 01:56:04,832
We want the sea to part.
If we want the rock to split,

1563
01:56:04,915 --> 01:56:06,917
we have to do it ourselves...

1564
01:56:07,001 --> 01:56:08,794
with these.

1565
01:56:11,172 --> 01:56:13,924
It seems strange to be
holding these, doesn't it?

1566
01:56:14,008 --> 01:56:16,343
We've been forbidden to carry
weapons for 400 years...

1567
01:56:16,343 --> 01:56:18,053
We've been forbidden to carry
weapons for 400 years...

1568
01:56:18,137 --> 01:56:20,472
Forbidden to strike back
when someone attacked us.

1569
01:56:20,473 --> 01:56:22,224
Forbidden to strike back
when someone attacked us.

1570
01:56:22,308 --> 01:56:24,643
All that changes today.

1571
01:56:24,643 --> 01:56:27,646
All that changes today.

1572
01:56:27,730 --> 01:56:30,399
You're the ones who will work
the miracles now.

1573
01:56:32,902 --> 01:56:35,905
(Moses)
Joshua will lead you in battle.

1574
01:56:35,988 --> 01:56:38,573
Like you, he's never
fought one before,

1575
01:56:38,616 --> 01:56:40,951
But the Amalekites are fighting
for loot and slaves.

1576
01:56:40,951 --> 01:56:42,160
But the Amalekites are fighting
for loot and slaves.

1577
01:56:42,244 --> 01:56:44,579
We are fighting for the right
to exist as free people.

1578
01:56:44,580 --> 01:56:45,789
We are fighting for the right
to exist as free people.

1579
01:56:45,873 --> 01:56:48,208
Our cause
is the greater one...

1580
01:56:48,209 --> 01:56:49,835
Our cause
is the greater one...

1581
01:56:49,919 --> 01:56:52,254
and God is with us.

1582
01:56:52,254 --> 01:56:54,172
And God is with us.

1583
01:56:54,256 --> 01:56:56,174
(cheering)

1584
01:57:02,848 --> 01:57:04,224
- Moses.
- Give us a sword.

1585
01:57:07,019 --> 01:57:08,687
We have enough sworders.

1586
01:57:08,771 --> 01:57:10,606
It's for them.

1587
01:57:10,648 --> 01:57:12,483
One sword won't fight off
the Amalekite army.

1588
01:57:12,608 --> 01:57:14,359
No...

1589
01:57:14,443 --> 01:57:16,820
But it can make sure
they won't take us alive.

1590
01:57:16,904 --> 01:57:19,740
We won't be
their concubines.

1591
01:57:19,823 --> 01:57:22,158
Our children
won't be their slaves.

1592
01:57:22,159 --> 01:57:23,743
Our children
won't be their slaves.

1593
01:57:33,629 --> 01:57:36,089
Wait.

1594
01:57:51,689 --> 01:57:54,149
(goats bleating)

1595
01:57:54,233 --> 01:57:56,985
Hup, hup.
Come along.

1596
01:57:57,069 --> 01:57:59,112
Move, move. Come on.

1597
01:57:59,196 --> 01:58:01,281
Get over there, you.
Keep moving.

1598
01:58:01,365 --> 01:58:02,657
(man) What's back there?

1599
01:58:02,741 --> 01:58:04,868
(horses neigh)

1600
01:58:04,952 --> 01:58:07,287
All right,
they've seen us! Run!

1601
01:58:07,288 --> 01:58:08,414
All right,
they've seen us! Run!

1602
01:58:16,005 --> 01:58:17,798
(man) Here they come.

1603
01:58:19,174 --> 01:58:21,593
(all yelling)

1604
01:58:30,978 --> 01:58:32,270
(grunting)

1605
01:58:44,617 --> 01:58:46,368
(horses neighing)

1606
01:58:48,329 --> 01:58:50,831
Whoa! Oh! Whoa!

1607
01:58:54,293 --> 01:58:56,420
(yelling)

1608
01:58:56,503 --> 01:58:59,589
Look over there!
They went that way!

1609
01:58:59,715 --> 01:59:02,718
(men yelling)

1610
01:59:55,020 --> 01:59:56,688
Aah!

1611
01:59:56,772 --> 01:59:59,357
(grunting)

1612
02:00:24,174 --> 02:00:25,800
(grunting)

1613
02:00:28,679 --> 02:00:30,347
Aah!

1614
02:01:14,600 --> 02:01:17,853
Run!

1615
02:01:28,530 --> 02:01:30,532
- (woman) Look.
- (horse approaching)

1616
02:01:32,576 --> 02:01:34,911
Amalekites!

1617
02:01:34,912 --> 02:01:37,915
Amalekites!

1618
02:01:42,419 --> 02:01:45,171
<i>Uhn.</i>

1619
02:01:51,303 --> 02:01:53,221
Follow me!

1620
02:01:53,305 --> 02:01:55,640
(all yelling)

1621
02:01:55,641 --> 02:01:56,808
(all yelling)

1622
02:02:44,982 --> 02:02:47,609
Uhh! Ooh!

1623
02:02:47,693 --> 02:02:48,735
Oh!

1624
02:02:53,740 --> 02:02:56,451
Aah!

1625
02:02:56,535 --> 02:02:58,578
Uhh!

1626
02:03:06,628 --> 02:03:08,796
(grunting)

1627
02:03:17,681 --> 02:03:20,016
Come here. Don't look.

1628
02:03:20,017 --> 02:03:21,393
Come here. Don't look.

1629
02:03:30,652 --> 02:03:33,696
Have we pleased you?

1630
02:03:35,824 --> 02:03:38,159
Did we pass the test?

1631
02:03:38,160 --> 02:03:39,494
Did we pass the test?

1632
02:03:41,204 --> 02:03:43,539
How many more tests like this
will you send us?

1633
02:03:43,540 --> 02:03:45,583
How many more tests like this
will you send us?

1634
02:03:49,755 --> 02:03:52,507
We fought and won today.

1635
02:03:52,591 --> 02:03:55,802
Will we have
to keep fighting and winning

1636
02:03:55,886 --> 02:03:58,221
to show we're worthy of you?

1637
02:03:58,221 --> 02:03:59,347
To show we're worthy of you?

1638
02:04:01,516 --> 02:04:04,560
How many other battles like this
will we have to fight

1639
02:04:04,645 --> 02:04:07,397
To prove that?

1640
02:04:23,163 --> 02:04:26,207
(sighs)

1641
02:04:56,071 --> 02:04:58,364
(Miriam) We won.

1642
02:04:58,448 --> 02:05:01,617
He led us to victory.

1643
02:05:01,702 --> 02:05:04,037
With Aaron at his side.

1644
02:05:04,037 --> 02:05:05,872
With Aaron at his side.

1645
02:05:05,956 --> 02:05:08,291
Moses said here
is where we stand and fight.

1646
02:05:08,291 --> 02:05:10,626
Moses said here
is where we stand and fight.

1647
02:05:10,627 --> 02:05:11,669
Moses said here
is where we stand and fight.

1648
02:05:11,753 --> 02:05:14,756
True.

1649
02:05:14,840 --> 02:05:16,842
But at what cost?

1650
02:05:18,719 --> 02:05:21,847
How many more victories
like this can we afford?

1651
02:06:50,227 --> 02:06:53,313
I have betrayed
my husband.

1652
02:06:56,191 --> 02:06:59,402
I've betrayed my wife.

1653
02:07:06,409 --> 02:07:08,744
(donkey braying)

1654
02:07:08,745 --> 02:07:10,371
(donkey braying)

1655
02:07:16,044 --> 02:07:18,963
Stop!

1656
02:07:19,047 --> 02:07:21,007
Stop there!

1657
02:07:23,093 --> 02:07:24,761
Stop there!

1658
02:07:24,845 --> 02:07:26,429
Take that silly toy away.

1659
02:07:26,513 --> 02:07:27,931
I said, stop!

1660
02:07:28,014 --> 02:07:30,349
I'm looking
for a man called Moses.

1661
02:07:30,350 --> 02:07:31,559
I'm looking
for a man called Moses.

1662
02:07:48,702 --> 02:07:50,453
Moses!

1663
02:07:51,580 --> 02:07:53,832
Moses!

1664
02:08:14,269 --> 02:08:16,854
Zipporah.

1665
02:08:22,444 --> 02:08:24,446
Zipporah!

1666
02:08:50,555 --> 02:08:53,599
I heard about the Moses
who defeated the Pharaoh

1667
02:08:53,683 --> 02:08:56,227
and his whole army...

1668
02:08:56,311 --> 02:08:59,314
Led his people
into the desert...

1669
02:08:59,397 --> 02:09:02,149
Got into a fight
with the Amalekites.

1670
02:09:02,234 --> 02:09:03,735
(laughs)

1671
02:09:03,818 --> 02:09:06,153
Killed them all,
burned their village...

1672
02:09:06,154 --> 02:09:07,446
Killed them all,
burned their village...

1673
02:09:07,530 --> 02:09:09,532
That was you?

1674
02:09:09,616 --> 02:09:11,659
The Moses
who married Zipporah,

1675
02:09:11,743 --> 02:09:14,829
The daughter of Jethro,
yes, who--

1676
02:09:14,913 --> 02:09:17,206
Who seems to want
to forget me.

1677
02:09:19,334 --> 02:09:20,626
Take any of them slaves?

1678
02:09:20,710 --> 02:09:22,628
No.

1679
02:09:22,712 --> 02:09:25,047
Ah, pity...
All an Amalekite is good for.

1680
02:09:25,048 --> 02:09:26,424
Ah, pity...
All an Amalekite is good for.

1681
02:09:26,508 --> 02:09:28,843
How did you do it...

1682
02:09:28,843 --> 02:09:30,427
How did you do it...

1683
02:09:30,512 --> 02:09:33,598
That God of yours...

1684
02:09:33,682 --> 02:09:35,767
The one who spoke to you?

1685
02:09:35,850 --> 02:09:38,561
We owe it all to him, yes.

1686
02:09:38,645 --> 02:09:41,856
He spoke to you
in the mountains, yes?

1687
02:09:41,940 --> 02:09:43,858
Then he was in Egypt,

1688
02:09:43,942 --> 02:09:45,777
And now he's here
in the desert, too?

1689
02:09:45,860 --> 02:09:49,071
Yes.

1690
02:09:49,155 --> 02:09:52,074
You take him with you?

1691
02:09:55,412 --> 02:09:57,747
I think it's more like
he's with us all the time.

1692
02:09:57,747 --> 02:09:59,832
I think it's more like
he's with us all the time.

1693
02:09:59,916 --> 02:10:02,251
- How?
- (laughs) I don't know.

1694
02:10:02,252 --> 02:10:04,587
- How?
- (laughs) I don't know.

1695
02:10:04,587 --> 02:10:05,879
- How?
- (laughs) I don't know.

1696
02:10:05,964 --> 02:10:08,174
He's a mountain God,
and a--and a God of slaves,

1697
02:10:08,258 --> 02:10:11,219
and a God of free men,
and a God of the desert.

1698
02:10:11,303 --> 02:10:13,596
He seems to be everywhere.

1699
02:10:18,268 --> 02:10:20,395
He still speaks to you?

1700
02:10:20,478 --> 02:10:22,813
Sometimes
I think I hear him...

1701
02:10:22,814 --> 02:10:25,149
Sometimes
I think I hear him...

1702
02:10:25,233 --> 02:10:27,401
but I think he wants me
to work it all out for myself

1703
02:10:27,444 --> 02:10:29,779
If--if I can...
(laughs)

1704
02:10:29,779 --> 02:10:31,822
If--if I can...
(laughs)

1705
02:10:31,906 --> 02:10:34,658
But he's still here...

1706
02:10:34,743 --> 02:10:37,078
Watching, listening,
telling me somehow

1707
02:10:37,078 --> 02:10:39,413
Watching, listening,
telling me somehow

1708
02:10:39,497 --> 02:10:41,832
That when
I really need him again...

1709
02:10:41,833 --> 02:10:42,875
That when
I really need him again...

1710
02:10:42,959 --> 02:10:44,794
He'll be there.

1711
02:10:48,298 --> 02:10:51,551
Who are you going to fight next,
the Philistines?

1712
02:10:51,634 --> 02:10:54,136
Deserve as much
as the Amalekites got.

1713
02:10:54,220 --> 02:10:56,513
I hope not
to have to fight anyone...

1714
02:10:56,598 --> 02:10:58,933
But I doubt
if it can be like that.

1715
02:10:58,933 --> 02:11:00,142
But I doubt
if it can be like that.

1716
02:11:00,226 --> 02:11:02,561
Where are you headed?
Where are you taking them?

1717
02:11:02,562 --> 02:11:05,439
Where are you headed?
Where are you taking them?

1718
02:11:05,482 --> 02:11:08,526
To the land
God promised them.

1719
02:11:08,610 --> 02:11:10,945
First, there's--there's
something he wants from them

1720
02:11:10,945 --> 02:11:12,529
First, there's--there's
something he wants from them

1721
02:11:12,614 --> 02:11:15,742
and from me.

1722
02:11:15,825 --> 02:11:18,160
It has to do with the desert.
Something we have to find here.

1723
02:11:18,161 --> 02:11:20,496
It has to do with the desert.
Something we have to find here.

1724
02:11:20,497 --> 02:11:23,082
It has to do with the desert.
Something we have to find here.

1725
02:11:23,166 --> 02:11:25,960
Can you find it...

1726
02:11:26,044 --> 02:11:28,504
If you don't know
what it is?

1727
02:11:32,842 --> 02:11:35,177
You weren't much of a shepherd
when you came to me first...

1728
02:11:35,178 --> 02:11:36,637
You weren't much of a shepherd
when you came to me first...

1729
02:11:36,721 --> 02:11:39,932
Had to learn it,
but you learned well.

1730
02:11:40,016 --> 02:11:42,268
(sighs)
What a hard drive it is.

1731
02:11:42,352 --> 02:11:45,521
Dangerous at times, lonely.

1732
02:11:45,605 --> 02:11:48,190
Don't always do
what you tell them, do they?

1733
02:11:48,274 --> 02:11:50,609
Sometimes they kick you.

1734
02:11:50,610 --> 02:11:51,694
Sometimes they kick you.

1735
02:11:53,363 --> 02:11:56,074
They have no one else
to rely on.

1736
02:11:56,157 --> 02:11:58,617
You feed them,
care for them,

1737
02:11:58,701 --> 02:12:01,370
stop the wolves
from getting to them.

1738
02:12:01,496 --> 02:12:04,499
But sheep
don't complain all the time--

1739
02:12:04,541 --> 02:12:06,501
Argue with every decision
you make,

1740
02:12:06,543 --> 02:12:09,045
plot against you.

1741
02:12:09,129 --> 02:12:11,214
I have someone
to protect me.

1742
02:12:11,297 --> 02:12:13,424
He's the only one
I can trust

1743
02:12:13,508 --> 02:12:14,675
apart from
my brother and sister.

1744
02:12:14,759 --> 02:12:17,094
No. You can't trust anyone.

1745
02:12:17,095 --> 02:12:19,055
No. You can't trust anyone.

1746
02:12:19,139 --> 02:12:21,516
He'd lay down
his life for me.

1747
02:12:21,558 --> 02:12:23,893
Tonight, perhaps,
but tomorrow...

1748
02:12:23,893 --> 02:12:25,311
Tonight, perhaps,
but tomorrow...

1749
02:12:25,395 --> 02:12:27,605
Things can change.

1750
02:12:27,689 --> 02:12:29,732
Your own family
doesn't change.

1751
02:12:29,816 --> 02:12:31,692
I taught you
to be a shepherd.

1752
02:12:31,776 --> 02:12:34,111
I taught you to survive
out here.

1753
02:12:34,112 --> 02:12:35,279
I taught you to survive
out here.

1754
02:12:35,363 --> 02:12:37,531
Listen to me. When you run
in front of the pack,

1755
02:12:37,615 --> 02:12:39,950
what do they see?
Your back

1756
02:12:39,951 --> 02:12:41,702
what do they see?
Your back

1757
02:12:41,786 --> 02:12:44,121
makes for a broad
and tempting target.

1758
02:12:44,122 --> 02:12:45,456
Makes for a broad
and tempting target.

1759
02:12:45,540 --> 02:12:47,458
You cannot trust anyone.

1760
02:12:47,542 --> 02:12:49,460
You cannot trust
anyone at all.

1761
02:12:49,544 --> 02:12:51,462
You shouldn't
even trust me.

1762
02:12:51,546 --> 02:12:52,922
Not trust you?

1763
02:12:53,006 --> 02:12:55,341
Well, me, perhaps.
(laughs)

1764
02:12:55,341 --> 02:12:57,343
Well, me, perhaps.
(laughs)

1765
02:13:00,388 --> 02:13:01,806
Point made.

1766
02:13:01,890 --> 02:13:04,392
(laughs)

1767
02:13:04,476 --> 02:13:06,186
You're still not there,

1768
02:13:06,269 --> 02:13:08,729
despite all the airs
you give yourself.

1769
02:13:08,813 --> 02:13:10,731
You're still
a long way away.

1770
02:13:10,815 --> 02:13:12,817
(whispers)
You have a lot to learn.

1771
02:13:16,321 --> 02:13:18,656
You think
she wants you to forget her?

1772
02:13:18,656 --> 02:13:21,325
You think
she wants you to forget her?

1773
02:13:21,409 --> 02:13:24,495
I think
she doesn't want that at all.

1774
02:13:39,135 --> 02:13:41,137
(donkeys braying)

1775
02:13:41,221 --> 02:13:43,431
(horse neighs)

1776
02:13:50,522 --> 02:13:53,191
So you are him...

1777
02:13:53,274 --> 02:13:55,192
The Moses
whose name is famous

1778
02:13:55,276 --> 02:13:56,777
all across the desert.

1779
02:13:56,861 --> 02:13:59,196
You... (sniffles)

1780
02:13:59,197 --> 02:14:00,323
You... (sniffles)

1781
02:14:00,406 --> 02:14:02,741
How has this time
been for you?

1782
02:14:02,742 --> 02:14:04,326
How has this time
been for you?

1783
02:14:04,410 --> 02:14:06,745
Since my husband
sent me away?

1784
02:14:14,045 --> 02:14:16,380
Those are your sons.

1785
02:14:16,381 --> 02:14:18,007
Those are your sons.

1786
02:14:18,091 --> 02:14:20,426
They're of an age
to ask who their father is.

1787
02:14:20,426 --> 02:14:22,636
They're of an age
to ask who their father is.

1788
02:14:22,679 --> 02:14:25,306
What do I tell them?

1789
02:14:25,390 --> 02:14:27,642
That they're not just
the sons of a sheepherder,

1790
02:14:27,684 --> 02:14:30,019
but a warrior
and a leader of men?

1791
02:14:30,019 --> 02:14:31,145
But a warrior
and a leader of men?

1792
02:14:33,398 --> 02:14:35,733
That we're going
to be together from now on?

1793
02:14:35,733 --> 02:14:37,192
That we're going
to be together from now on?

1794
02:14:37,277 --> 02:14:39,612
They have been cast adrift
as children, too,

1795
02:14:39,612 --> 02:14:40,738
They have been cast adrift
as children, too,

1796
02:14:40,822 --> 02:14:43,157
just as you were.

1797
02:14:43,157 --> 02:14:45,284
Just as you were.

1798
02:14:45,368 --> 02:14:47,703
Don't you want
to bring them to shore...

1799
02:14:47,704 --> 02:14:49,872
Don't you want
to bring them to shore...

1800
02:14:49,956 --> 02:14:52,291
Tell them how much
you love them?

1801
02:14:52,292 --> 02:14:53,334
Tell them how much
you love them?

1802
02:15:04,929 --> 02:15:07,181
I'm not a king.

1803
02:15:07,265 --> 02:15:09,183
I am a shepherd.

1804
02:15:09,267 --> 02:15:12,311
This is my flock.
I can't abandon it.

1805
02:15:12,395 --> 02:15:15,689
We'll stay with you.

1806
02:15:15,732 --> 02:15:18,568
We'll go on the journey
with you.

1807
02:15:22,697 --> 02:15:25,032
(crying) I can't.
This takes everything I have...

1808
02:15:25,033 --> 02:15:27,744
(crying) I can't.
This takes everything I have...

1809
02:15:27,827 --> 02:15:30,162
every moment
of the day and the night.

1810
02:15:30,163 --> 02:15:32,498
Every moment
of the day and the night.

1811
02:15:32,498 --> 02:15:33,624
Every moment
of the day and the night.

1812
02:15:33,708 --> 02:15:36,043
(crying)

1813
02:15:36,044 --> 02:15:37,628
(crying)

1814
02:15:45,803 --> 02:15:47,721
(boy) What is it?

1815
02:15:47,805 --> 02:15:51,058
It's all right.
Don't worry.

1816
02:15:55,146 --> 02:15:57,731
Don't worry.

1817
02:16:00,026 --> 02:16:02,361
If you make my mother cry,
I'll kill you.

1818
02:16:02,362 --> 02:16:04,530
If you make my mother cry,
I'll kill you.

1819
02:16:11,329 --> 02:16:13,664
This is my son Gershom.

1820
02:16:13,665 --> 02:16:15,375
This is my son Gershom.

1821
02:16:15,458 --> 02:16:17,793
His father is a long way away.
He is on a journey...

1822
02:16:17,794 --> 02:16:20,588
His father is a long way away.
He is on a journey...

1823
02:16:20,672 --> 02:16:23,007
One it doesn't seem
he's coming back from.

1824
02:16:23,007 --> 02:16:24,299
One it doesn't seem
he's coming back from.

1825
02:16:43,778 --> 02:16:46,906
(donkeys braying)

1826
02:16:46,989 --> 02:16:49,449
Where are we going?

1827
02:16:49,534 --> 02:16:51,202
Wish you were
coming with us.

1828
02:16:51,285 --> 02:16:53,620
I'd like those boys
to have a father...

1829
02:16:53,621 --> 02:16:55,372
I'd like those boys
to have a father...

1830
02:16:55,456 --> 02:16:58,292
And her to have
a--to have a husband...

1831
02:16:58,376 --> 02:17:01,087
And me to have...

1832
02:17:01,170 --> 02:17:04,381
To have a...

1833
02:17:04,465 --> 02:17:07,009
Just remember...

1834
02:17:07,093 --> 02:17:08,511
Trust nobody.

1835
02:17:08,594 --> 02:17:11,888
Nobody.

1836
02:17:17,395 --> 02:17:19,438
Why is God punishing you?

1837
02:17:19,522 --> 02:17:22,316
He's taken
your brother Menerith,

1838
02:17:22,400 --> 02:17:24,318
made you turn
your back on Jethro

1839
02:17:24,402 --> 02:17:26,320
who was like a father to you.

1840
02:17:26,404 --> 02:17:29,156
Turn your back on me,
on your sons.

1841
02:17:31,409 --> 02:17:33,744
How much more
will he take from you?

1842
02:17:33,745 --> 02:17:35,413
How much more
will he take from you?

1843
02:17:35,496 --> 02:17:37,831
Is what you're seeking
worth what it's costing you?

1844
02:17:37,832 --> 02:17:39,124
Is what you're seeking
worth what it's costing you?

1845
02:17:59,437 --> 02:18:01,772
You want to take everything
from me, is that it?

1846
02:18:01,773 --> 02:18:04,901
You want to take everything
from me, is that it?

1847
02:18:04,984 --> 02:18:08,320
I'm to have nothing left?

1848
02:18:08,404 --> 02:18:10,322
Other people
can have wives and children

1849
02:18:10,406 --> 02:18:12,408
and fathers and mothers,
but not me

1850
02:18:12,492 --> 02:18:14,827
Because--Because you chose me--
for what?

1851
02:18:14,827 --> 02:18:16,078
Because--Because you chose me--
for what?

1852
02:18:16,162 --> 02:18:18,497
To suffer? To be alone?

1853
02:18:18,498 --> 02:18:21,250
To suffer? To be alone?

1854
02:18:21,334 --> 02:18:23,669
Take it. Take it all.

1855
02:18:23,669 --> 02:18:25,295
Take it. Take it all.

1856
02:18:25,379 --> 02:18:28,548
Do--Do you want me naked?

1857
02:18:28,633 --> 02:18:30,885
Do you want me to have
nothing left at all

1858
02:18:30,968 --> 02:18:33,887
except this--this burden,
this responsibility

1859
02:18:33,971 --> 02:18:36,306
when you won't even tell me
where I'm supposed to lead them

1860
02:18:36,307 --> 02:18:37,683
when you won't even tell me
where I'm supposed to lead them

1861
02:18:37,767 --> 02:18:39,643
and how long it will take?

1862
02:18:42,271 --> 02:18:44,606
There. Get someone else.
I never asked for it.

1863
02:18:44,607 --> 02:18:46,358
There. Get someone else.
I never asked for it.

1864
02:18:46,442 --> 02:18:48,360
I don't want
to be the Chosen One.

1865
02:18:48,444 --> 02:18:50,362
I just want the life
that other men have.

1866
02:18:50,446 --> 02:18:53,782
I.--

1867
02:18:53,908 --> 02:18:56,744
I want my children.

1868
02:18:56,828 --> 02:18:59,163
At least talk to me!
Give me an answer.

1869
02:18:59,163 --> 02:19:02,124
At least talk to me!
Give me an answer.

1870
02:19:02,208 --> 02:19:04,543
Give me a sign
that you're there.

1871
02:19:04,544 --> 02:19:06,420
Give me a sign
that you're there.

1872
02:19:06,504 --> 02:19:09,131
Moses...

1873
02:19:15,179 --> 02:19:16,638
Moses...

1874
02:19:18,724 --> 02:19:21,309
You all right?

1875
02:19:21,394 --> 02:19:24,063
You got lost?

1876
02:19:24,146 --> 02:19:27,107
I was praying...

1877
02:19:27,191 --> 02:19:30,319
Talking to God.

1878
02:19:35,741 --> 02:19:37,284
The well's run dry.

1879
02:19:37,368 --> 02:19:40,371
We need you to tell us
where to go next.

1880
02:19:42,498 --> 02:19:45,083
Very well, then.

1881
02:19:45,167 --> 02:19:47,085
We need tallow for candles,

1882
02:19:47,169 --> 02:19:48,378
but we can't make it
while we're on the move, so...

1883
02:19:48,462 --> 02:19:50,338
And we need more wood
for the fires,

1884
02:19:50,423 --> 02:19:53,467
and wolves got into
the sheepfold last night, and...

1885
02:19:53,551 --> 02:19:56,554
<i>383</i>

1886
02:20:04,854 --> 02:20:07,398
(bleating)

1887
02:20:13,279 --> 02:20:15,406
That's far enough, Enoch.
Come down.

1888
02:20:17,074 --> 02:20:18,825
(camel grunts)

1889
02:20:18,910 --> 02:20:20,369
- (grunts)
- Keep him steady.

1890
02:20:33,716 --> 02:20:36,427
(man) Moses, please, make him
pay me what he owes me.

1891
02:20:36,510 --> 02:20:38,762
I paid you.
They're my witnesses.

1892
02:20:38,846 --> 02:20:41,014
No, no! You bribed them
to say it!

1893
02:20:41,098 --> 02:20:43,016
- He bribed them!
- Yes.

1894
02:20:43,100 --> 02:20:45,018
- He bribed them!
- Moses!

1895
02:20:45,061 --> 02:20:46,645
- (man) I did not!
- I'm telling you, this man's a liar!

1896
02:20:46,729 --> 02:20:48,564
He made my daughter pregnant!

1897
02:20:48,648 --> 02:20:51,150
- Make him marry her!
- That's a lie! I never laid with her!

1898
02:20:51,233 --> 02:20:52,317
Liar! He lied!

1899
02:20:52,401 --> 02:20:55,445
(all yelling)

1900
02:20:55,529 --> 02:20:57,447
He appointed himself
our leader.

1901
02:20:57,531 --> 02:20:59,449
He made himself
our military commander.

1902
02:20:59,533 --> 02:21:01,451
Now he's our judge, too.

1903
02:21:01,535 --> 02:21:03,870
My husband beat me again!
Make it stop!

1904
02:21:03,871 --> 02:21:05,455
My husband beat me again!
Make it stop!

1905
02:21:05,539 --> 02:21:07,874
(all yelling)

1906
02:21:07,875 --> 02:21:09,209
(all yelling)

1907
02:21:22,431 --> 02:21:24,516
(shouts indistinctly)

1908
02:21:32,566 --> 02:21:34,859
- No, please.
- No. Leave her!

1909
02:21:34,944 --> 02:21:37,071
- Please, no!
- She's my wife.

1910
02:21:37,113 --> 02:21:39,657
Stop it, stop it, please.

1911
02:21:39,740 --> 02:21:42,117
- I said, leave her!
- No!

1912
02:21:42,201 --> 02:21:45,245
No! No!

1913
02:21:45,329 --> 02:21:47,205
Please, no.

1914
02:21:47,289 --> 02:21:49,374
Please don't fight, no!

1915
02:21:49,458 --> 02:21:50,625
(sobbing)

1916
02:21:50,710 --> 02:21:52,586
Stop, please!

1917
02:21:52,670 --> 02:21:53,837
Oh.

1918
02:21:53,921 --> 02:21:55,339
(grunting)

1919
02:22:00,594 --> 02:22:02,178
No!

1920
02:22:12,106 --> 02:22:15,442
No!

1921
02:22:15,526 --> 02:22:17,861
(crying)
What have we done?

1922
02:22:17,862 --> 02:22:19,196
(crying)
What have we done?

1923
02:22:19,280 --> 02:22:21,615
(both grunting)

1924
02:22:21,615 --> 02:22:23,617
(both grunting)

1925
02:22:37,548 --> 02:22:39,591
(grunts)

1926
02:22:42,678 --> 02:22:45,013
It's Philistine land
way over there.

1927
02:22:45,014 --> 02:22:46,306
It's Philistine land
way over there.

1928
02:22:46,390 --> 02:22:49,142
We're not strong enough
to fight them yet.

1929
02:22:49,226 --> 02:22:52,187
We'll head
that way instead.

1930
02:22:54,315 --> 02:22:56,692
(Aaron) Did the Philistines
build that?

1931
02:22:56,776 --> 02:22:59,111
No. It's a temple
for an Egyptian outpost.

1932
02:22:59,111 --> 02:23:00,320
No. It's a temple
for an Egyptian outpost.

1933
02:23:00,404 --> 02:23:02,322
How do you know that?

1934
02:23:02,406 --> 02:23:05,158
I was a Prince of Egypt once,
remember?

1935
02:23:05,201 --> 02:23:07,244
(man) The Pharaoh Akhenaten

1936
02:23:07,328 --> 02:23:09,663
said there wasn't
one God for Egypt

1937
02:23:09,663 --> 02:23:11,331
said there wasn't
one God for Egypt

1938
02:23:11,415 --> 02:23:14,209
and other Gods
for other people.

1939
02:23:14,293 --> 02:23:16,628
The Philistines
must have overrun it.

1940
02:23:16,629 --> 02:23:18,047
The Philistines
must have overrun it.

1941
02:23:18,172 --> 02:23:20,507
No. The Egyptians
destroyed it themselves.

1942
02:23:20,508 --> 02:23:22,218
No. The Egyptians
destroyed it themselves.

1943
02:23:22,301 --> 02:23:24,636
If the idea of God
had any meaning,

1944
02:23:24,637 --> 02:23:26,180
If the idea of God
had any meaning,

1945
02:23:26,222 --> 02:23:28,557
there could only be
one all-powerful God...

1946
02:23:28,557 --> 02:23:31,184
there could only be
one all-powerful God...

1947
02:23:31,268 --> 02:23:33,603
But if men
started to question

1948
02:23:33,604 --> 02:23:34,980
But if men
started to question

1949
02:23:35,064 --> 02:23:36,982
what they had been told
to believe

1950
02:23:37,066 --> 02:23:40,194
since the world began,

1951
02:23:40,277 --> 02:23:42,612
what else might they not
begin to question?

1952
02:23:42,613 --> 02:23:43,947
What else might they not
begin to question?

1953
02:23:44,031 --> 02:23:46,366
One God...
A ridiculous idea.

1954
02:23:46,367 --> 02:23:48,702
One God...
A ridiculous idea.

1955
02:23:48,702 --> 02:23:50,203
One God...
A ridiculous idea.

1956
02:23:50,246 --> 02:23:52,581
Far better that there should be
as many gods as there are men

1957
02:23:52,581 --> 02:23:55,834
Far better that there should be
as many gods as there are men

1958
02:23:55,918 --> 02:23:58,253
if only to keep us priests
employed. (laughs)

1959
02:23:58,254 --> 02:24:00,589
If only to keep us priests
employed. (laughs)

1960
02:24:00,589 --> 02:24:02,757
If only to keep us priests
employed. (laughs)

1961
02:24:02,842 --> 02:24:05,177
If--if there was one God...

1962
02:24:05,177 --> 02:24:08,221
If--if there was one God...

1963
02:24:08,264 --> 02:24:10,599
If he made the world and the sun
and the moon and the stars,

1964
02:24:10,599 --> 02:24:12,225
If he made the world and the sun
and the moon and the stars,

1965
02:24:12,268 --> 02:24:14,603
Then--Then he'd be everywhere,
wouldn't he?

1966
02:24:14,603 --> 02:24:16,271
Then--Then he'd be everywhere,
wouldn't he?

1967
02:24:16,355 --> 02:24:18,231
He'd be a God of the desert

1968
02:24:18,274 --> 02:24:20,693
and the cities,
and the mountains, too.

1969
02:24:20,776 --> 02:24:23,320
He'd be
in the wind and flames...

1970
02:24:23,404 --> 02:24:26,115
And in your heart, too.

1971
02:24:26,240 --> 02:24:28,367
You wouldn't have to make
a statue of him to worship

1972
02:24:28,450 --> 02:24:30,493
because--because
he'd be all around you,

1973
02:24:30,578 --> 02:24:32,413
and...

1974
02:24:32,496 --> 02:24:34,414
you could be a nomad
and still be in touch with him,

1975
02:24:34,498 --> 02:24:36,875
and if you asked him
his name...

1976
02:24:36,959 --> 02:24:38,877
that's how he'd answer.

1977
02:24:38,961 --> 02:24:40,754
He's--He's no need for a name.
He just is,

1978
02:24:40,838 --> 02:24:43,757
and he is what he is.
One God.

1979
02:24:43,841 --> 02:24:45,759
Not one among many.

1980
02:24:45,843 --> 02:24:48,178
One. The one!

1981
02:24:48,179 --> 02:24:50,181
One. The one!

1982
02:24:50,264 --> 02:24:52,140
(bleating)

1983
02:25:16,665 --> 02:25:19,000
(people speaking indistinctly)

1984
02:25:19,001 --> 02:25:21,169
(people speaking indistinctly)

1985
02:25:58,791 --> 02:26:01,043
(crying)

1986
02:26:19,103 --> 02:26:21,021
Have we run out of enemies

1987
02:26:21,105 --> 02:26:24,024
So that we need
to turn on our own?

1988
02:26:24,108 --> 02:26:26,026
Is that what it is?

1989
02:26:26,110 --> 02:26:28,153
It's come to that?

1990
02:26:28,237 --> 02:26:31,156
I've brought them this far

1991
02:26:31,240 --> 02:26:33,867
only to have them
kill each other?

1992
02:26:33,951 --> 02:26:36,161
We brought them this far--
Aaron and I, too.

1993
02:26:36,245 --> 02:26:39,414
I'm sorry.
Yes, of course.

1994
02:26:39,498 --> 02:26:41,791
Without you two...

1995
02:26:44,211 --> 02:26:46,546
So... what now?

1996
02:26:46,547 --> 02:26:49,091
So... what now?

1997
02:26:49,174 --> 02:26:51,676
We find the killer
and punish him.

1998
02:26:51,760 --> 02:26:54,095
In front
of all the tribe.

1999
02:26:54,096 --> 02:26:55,263
In front
of all the tribe.

2000
02:26:55,389 --> 02:26:56,973
You agree?

2001
02:26:57,057 --> 02:26:59,809
If this goes unpunished,
what's to stop any man

2002
02:26:59,893 --> 02:27:02,061
from killing anyone
he has a quarrel with?

2003
02:27:02,146 --> 02:27:03,522
(footsteps approach)

2004
02:27:03,605 --> 02:27:05,940
I know who killed him.
I can name the murderer.

2005
02:27:05,941 --> 02:27:07,609
I know who killed him.
I can name the murderer.

2006
02:27:12,239 --> 02:27:15,283
Eleazar found him
trying to steal his new lambs.

2007
02:27:15,409 --> 02:27:18,412
They fought.
Yitzchak's for revenge.

2008
02:27:18,495 --> 02:27:20,705
We fought, yes, and I--

2009
02:27:20,789 --> 02:27:23,750
I did say I'd kill him,
but I didn't do it, I swear!

2010
02:27:23,834 --> 02:27:26,753
Has anyone proof
that he killed him...

2011
02:27:26,837 --> 02:27:28,755
Proof that he hid the body?

2012
02:27:28,839 --> 02:27:31,049
- No, but...
- Then let him go.

2013
02:27:31,133 --> 02:27:32,717
- No. No.
- I said...

2014
02:27:32,801 --> 02:27:35,136
Let him go!

2015
02:27:35,137 --> 02:27:37,472
Let him go!

2016
02:27:37,556 --> 02:27:40,225
I wouldn't punish a man
there's no proof against.

2017
02:27:40,309 --> 02:27:42,644
- Then let us have him.
- We are not an unthinking mob.

2018
02:27:42,644 --> 02:27:44,270
- Then let us have him.
- We are not an unthinking mob.

2019
02:27:44,355 --> 02:27:46,607
We are a tribe,
a people, a nation.

2020
02:27:46,690 --> 02:27:48,274
Haven't you learned that?!

2021
02:27:48,359 --> 02:27:50,694
We don't blindly seek revenge.

2022
02:27:50,694 --> 02:27:51,903
We don't blindly seek revenge.

2023
02:27:51,987 --> 02:27:54,322
- We look for justice.
-What justice is there

2024
02:27:54,448 --> 02:27:56,241
in letting this killer
go free?!

2025
02:27:56,325 --> 02:27:58,952
(man) He's right!
Where's the justice in that?

2026
02:27:59,036 --> 02:28:00,245
(man) No justice.

2027
02:28:00,329 --> 02:28:02,956
I say again...

2028
02:28:03,040 --> 02:28:05,375
Has anyone the proof?

2029
02:28:05,376 --> 02:28:06,502
Has anyone the proof?

2030
02:28:08,962 --> 02:28:11,214
Anyone?

2031
02:28:13,175 --> 02:28:14,259
Free him.

2032
02:28:14,343 --> 02:28:16,845
I saw them together!

2033
02:28:21,392 --> 02:28:24,144
They were arguing...

2034
02:28:24,228 --> 02:28:26,313
on the way to where
the body was found.

2035
02:28:32,945 --> 02:28:34,947
(crowd yelling)

2036
02:28:41,036 --> 02:28:43,788
(man) You know I didn't do it.
You know I didn't do it.

2037
02:28:43,872 --> 02:28:46,207
Please, no, no.
It wasn't me.

2038
02:28:46,208 --> 02:28:49,544
Please, no, no.
It wasn't me.

2039
02:28:49,628 --> 02:28:51,880
- What is it, Moses?
- Are you afraid to say the word?

2040
02:28:51,964 --> 02:28:54,007
What kind of leadership
is that?

2041
02:28:54,091 --> 02:28:56,802
No, no, this is wrong!

2042
02:28:56,885 --> 02:28:59,345
Blood for blood.
What other way can it be?

2043
02:28:59,430 --> 02:29:01,014
Isn't that right?

2044
02:29:01,098 --> 02:29:03,016
Why make murderers
of us, too...

2045
02:29:03,100 --> 02:29:05,018
Make us share the crime?

2046
02:29:05,102 --> 02:29:08,313
You've had your judgment.
Let her have hers.

2047
02:29:11,316 --> 02:29:13,651
(man) No! Please!

2048
02:29:13,652 --> 02:29:16,363
(man) No! Please!

2049
02:29:16,447 --> 02:29:17,990
No!

2050
02:29:22,161 --> 02:29:23,412
- Not yet.
- Moses...

2051
02:29:23,537 --> 02:29:25,705
- Not yet!
- He has to die.

2052
02:29:25,789 --> 02:29:27,957
You have no choice.

2053
02:29:36,425 --> 02:29:39,177
Come with me.

2054
02:29:59,781 --> 02:30:02,784
I killed someone once...

2055
02:30:02,868 --> 02:30:05,203
and then I hid the body...

2056
02:30:05,204 --> 02:30:06,747
and then I hid the body...

2057
02:30:06,830 --> 02:30:09,165
But no body
stays hidden for long.

2058
02:30:09,166 --> 02:30:11,376
But no body
stays hidden for long.

2059
02:30:11,460 --> 02:30:13,378
Even if no one finds it,

2060
02:30:13,462 --> 02:30:15,380
it still comes to you
in the night

2061
02:30:15,464 --> 02:30:17,591
because you took
the life from it.

2062
02:30:20,344 --> 02:30:22,679
I can never
forgive myself for that...

2063
02:30:22,679 --> 02:30:24,305
I can never
forgive myself for that...

2064
02:30:24,389 --> 02:30:26,724
even though I had good reason
for what I did.

2065
02:30:26,725 --> 02:30:27,976
Even though I had good reason
for what I did.

2066
02:30:31,980 --> 02:30:33,898
Sometimes I think that

2067
02:30:33,982 --> 02:30:36,317
is what God is making me
pay back for.

2068
02:30:36,318 --> 02:30:37,736
Is what God is making me
pay back for.

2069
02:30:45,077 --> 02:30:47,412
And you...

2070
02:30:47,412 --> 02:30:48,871
And you...

2071
02:30:48,956 --> 02:30:51,249
Does a ghost come to you
in the night...

2072
02:30:51,333 --> 02:30:52,292
(crying)

2073
02:30:52,376 --> 02:30:54,711
With that question
in its eyes--

2074
02:30:54,711 --> 02:30:55,795
With that question
in its eyes--

2075
02:30:55,879 --> 02:30:58,256
"What gave you the right
to take from me

2076
02:30:58,340 --> 02:31:01,426
"the life that God
breathed into me?"

2077
02:31:01,510 --> 02:31:03,970
(sobbing)

2078
02:31:07,474 --> 02:31:09,434
(sighs)

2079
02:31:11,478 --> 02:31:12,896
There. (kisses)

2080
02:31:12,980 --> 02:31:13,897
Oh.

2081
02:31:13,981 --> 02:31:15,899
My poor, poor child.

2082
02:31:15,983 --> 02:31:18,735
(cries)

2083
02:31:18,819 --> 02:31:20,821
(speaking indistinctly)

2084
02:31:29,913 --> 02:31:32,165
You...

2085
02:31:32,249 --> 02:31:35,168
of all of them.

2086
02:31:38,672 --> 02:31:41,007
I'm so ashamed.

2087
02:31:41,008 --> 02:31:42,676
I'm so ashamed.

2088
02:31:42,718 --> 02:31:45,178
All I wanted
was to serve you.

2089
02:31:45,262 --> 02:31:47,597
You.

2090
02:31:47,598 --> 02:31:48,682
You.

2091
02:31:48,765 --> 02:31:52,059
I was afraid
of your anger...

2092
02:31:52,144 --> 02:31:55,105
of what you would
think of me...

2093
02:31:55,188 --> 02:31:57,899
knowing how weak I was.

2094
02:31:57,983 --> 02:32:00,318
It was for you
I killed that man in Egypt...

2095
02:32:00,319 --> 02:32:02,654
It was for you
I killed that man in Egypt...

2096
02:32:02,654 --> 02:32:04,072
It was for you
I killed that man in Egypt...

2097
02:32:04,156 --> 02:32:06,491
to protect you and your wife.

2098
02:32:06,491 --> 02:32:07,783
To protect you and your wife.

2099
02:32:07,868 --> 02:32:09,911
(crying) I know.

2100
02:32:09,995 --> 02:32:11,913
And another man died

2101
02:32:11,997 --> 02:32:14,332
because you chose
to sleep with his wife!

2102
02:32:14,333 --> 02:32:16,960
Because you chose
to sleep with his wife!

2103
02:32:36,271 --> 02:32:38,606
My enemies are waiting
for just one sign of weakness...

2104
02:32:38,607 --> 02:32:40,984
My enemies are waiting
for just one sign of weakness...

2105
02:32:41,068 --> 02:32:43,403
Waiting for me to favor
those close to me,

2106
02:32:43,403 --> 02:32:44,695
Waiting for me to favor
those close to me,

2107
02:32:44,738 --> 02:32:47,073
and then they will strike...

2108
02:32:47,074 --> 02:32:49,159
and then they will strike...

2109
02:32:49,242 --> 02:32:51,577
and if I fall, then this
has all been for nothing.

2110
02:32:51,578 --> 02:32:54,038
And if I fall, then this
has all been for nothing.

2111
02:33:01,755 --> 02:33:03,798
At least spare her.

2112
02:33:03,882 --> 02:33:06,217
How can I do that and still
keep the people together?

2113
02:33:06,218 --> 02:33:08,136
How can I do that and still
keep the people together?

2114
02:33:08,220 --> 02:33:10,555
They want an example
to be made of both of you.

2115
02:33:10,555 --> 02:33:12,139
They want an example
to be made of both of you.

2116
02:33:12,224 --> 02:33:14,684
(crying)

2117
02:33:14,768 --> 02:33:17,103
Tell me you forgive me.

2118
02:33:17,104 --> 02:33:18,563
Tell me you forgive me.

2119
02:33:18,647 --> 02:33:20,982
It's for God to forgive.

2120
02:33:20,982 --> 02:33:23,776
It's for God to forgive.

2121
02:33:23,819 --> 02:33:26,154
But you understand I did it
out of fear and anger.

2122
02:33:26,154 --> 02:33:28,364
But you understand I did it
out of fear and anger.

2123
02:33:28,448 --> 02:33:29,740
I understand that

2124
02:33:29,783 --> 02:33:32,076
more than anyone else
in the world ever could.

2125
02:33:40,460 --> 02:33:41,085
Take him.

2126
02:33:53,640 --> 02:33:55,975
(shouting)

2127
02:33:55,976 --> 02:33:57,894
(shouting)

2128
02:34:37,100 --> 02:34:39,977
(rock thuds)

2129
02:34:40,061 --> 02:34:41,896
(all shouting)

2130
02:34:44,941 --> 02:34:46,859
(crying) Why?!

2131
02:34:46,943 --> 02:34:49,278
Why did you take him
as well?!

2132
02:34:49,279 --> 02:34:51,614
Why did you take him
as well?!

2133
02:34:51,615 --> 02:34:52,657
Why did you take him
as well?!

2134
02:34:52,741 --> 02:34:55,702
Why?!

2135
02:34:57,454 --> 02:34:59,789
Give me some answers.
Don't you dare ignore me!

2136
02:34:59,790 --> 02:35:02,501
Give me some answers.
Don't you dare ignore me!

2137
02:35:02,584 --> 02:35:05,795
Don't you dare!
I am Moses!

2138
02:35:05,879 --> 02:35:08,214
I am Moses!
(sobbing)

2139
02:35:08,215 --> 02:35:11,134
I am Moses!
(sobbing)

2140
02:35:14,012 --> 02:35:16,347
Tell me the rules
I have to teach them...

2141
02:35:16,348 --> 02:35:17,849
Tell me the rules
I have to teach them...

2142
02:35:17,891 --> 02:35:20,476
the rules we have to live by,

2143
02:35:20,560 --> 02:35:23,145
but let them come from you
and not from me.

2144
02:35:23,230 --> 02:35:26,566
Please, please
say something to me.

2145
02:35:37,911 --> 02:35:39,495
Moses.

2146
02:35:41,581 --> 02:35:43,916
Moses.

2147
02:35:49,172 --> 02:35:51,382
Come to me.

2148
02:35:51,466 --> 02:35:53,801
Come find the answers
you have sought for so long.

2149
02:35:53,802 --> 02:35:56,137
Come find the answers
you have sought for so long.

2150
02:35:56,137 --> 02:35:57,179
Come find the answers
you have sought for so long.

2151
02:36:13,947 --> 02:36:16,574
(thunder crashes)

2152
02:36:21,288 --> 02:36:23,623
When do we set out for the land
you've promised us...

2153
02:36:23,623 --> 02:36:26,417
When do we set out for the land
you've promised us...

2154
02:36:26,501 --> 02:36:29,545
and how do we get there?

2155
02:36:31,590 --> 02:36:33,925
This is where I wanted you
to bring them.

2156
02:36:33,925 --> 02:36:35,343
This is where I wanted you
to bring them.

2157
02:36:35,427 --> 02:36:38,471
Listen to my voice.

2158
02:36:40,473 --> 02:36:42,808
God has spoken to me again.

2159
02:36:42,809 --> 02:36:44,894
God has spoken to me again.

2160
02:36:44,978 --> 02:36:47,939
He will make
a bargain with us.

2161
02:36:47,981 --> 02:36:50,900
Instead of being slaves
and people without a home,

2162
02:36:50,984 --> 02:36:53,987
We will be a nation
of priests and holy men--

2163
02:36:54,029 --> 02:36:56,364
A special nation
if we obey his laws,

2164
02:36:56,364 --> 02:36:58,991
a special nation
if we obey his laws,

2165
02:36:59,034 --> 02:37:01,369
if we have no other God but him.
Shall we say yes?

2166
02:37:01,369 --> 02:37:02,495
If we have no other God but him.
Shall we say yes?

2167
02:37:02,579 --> 02:37:04,163
- (all) yes!
- Shall we?!

2168
02:37:04,247 --> 02:37:06,874
- Yes!
- You asked me for justice,

2169
02:37:07,000 --> 02:37:09,335
and I tried to find it
in here instead of there.

2170
02:37:09,336 --> 02:37:10,462
And I tried to find it
in here instead of there.

2171
02:37:10,545 --> 02:37:13,005
Do you accept God's bargain,

2172
02:37:13,089 --> 02:37:15,299
knowing how terrible
his anger will be

2173
02:37:15,383 --> 02:37:17,551
- if you fail to keep it?
- Yes!

2174
02:37:17,636 --> 02:37:18,553
(Moses) Yes?

2175
02:37:18,637 --> 02:37:19,971
(all) Yes!

2176
02:37:20,013 --> 02:37:21,097
You, my brother,

2177
02:37:21,181 --> 02:37:24,017
you will be the first priest
of this bargain with God

2178
02:37:24,100 --> 02:37:27,353
if you accept.

2179
02:37:27,437 --> 02:37:28,646
- Do you accept? 
- Yes!

2180
02:37:28,730 --> 02:37:31,232
- Yes!
- (all) Yes!

2181
02:37:37,113 --> 02:37:38,656
(thunder crashing)

2182
02:37:51,044 --> 02:37:53,671
(woman screams)

2183
02:38:01,012 --> 02:38:03,806
(people speaking indistinctly)

2184
02:38:10,522 --> 02:38:12,899
(baby cries)

2185
02:38:51,229 --> 02:38:54,106
How long must we wait?

2186
02:39:05,827 --> 02:39:06,828
(thunder crashes)

2187
02:39:11,833 --> 02:39:14,168
<i>383</i>

2188
02:39:14,169 --> 02:39:16,296
<i>383</i>

2189
02:39:52,207 --> 02:39:54,542
It's time.

2190
02:39:54,542 --> 02:39:55,834
It's time.

2191
02:39:58,296 --> 02:40:00,631
Are we Moses' subjects?

2192
02:40:00,632 --> 02:40:02,258
Are we Moses' subjects?

2193
02:40:02,342 --> 02:40:04,677
Is he our Pharaoh now...

2194
02:40:04,677 --> 02:40:06,595
Is he our Pharaoh now...

2195
02:40:06,679 --> 02:40:09,098
unable to move
without his permission?

2196
02:40:09,182 --> 02:40:11,517
This may be Moses' God,

2197
02:40:11,518 --> 02:40:13,228
This may be Moses' God,

2198
02:40:13,311 --> 02:40:15,229
But that doesn't mean
he's ours.

2199
02:40:15,313 --> 02:40:17,940
Has this God spoken
to any of us?

2200
02:40:18,024 --> 02:40:20,192
Have any of us
seen him?

2201
02:40:20,235 --> 02:40:22,570
We made a promise, yes,

2202
02:40:22,570 --> 02:40:24,196
We made a promise, yes,

2203
02:40:24,239 --> 02:40:26,783
but we didn't
do it willingly, did we?

2204
02:40:26,866 --> 02:40:30,077
- He forced us to agree.
- He forced us!

2205
02:40:30,161 --> 02:40:33,205
None of us have seen
this God!

2206
02:40:33,289 --> 02:40:35,165
It's not ours!

2207
02:40:37,335 --> 02:40:40,129
(baby crying)

2208
02:40:40,213 --> 02:40:43,507
They've won a battle--
two battles.

2209
02:40:43,591 --> 02:40:45,509
They destroyed the Egyptians
and then the Amalekites.

2210
02:40:45,593 --> 02:40:47,261
Shouldn't they celebrate?

2211
02:40:47,345 --> 02:40:49,138
Instead of having Moses speak
to them as if being chosen

2212
02:40:49,222 --> 02:40:51,140
As God's people
is a curse and not a reward.

2213
02:40:51,224 --> 02:40:54,227
Why don't we celebrate?

2214
02:40:54,269 --> 02:40:56,604
Don't we deserve to?

2215
02:40:56,688 --> 02:40:58,773
We should wait.

2216
02:41:11,035 --> 02:41:13,871
I love our brother...

2217
02:41:13,955 --> 02:41:16,290
but sometimes
when he looks at you...

2218
02:41:16,291 --> 02:41:17,500
but sometimes
when he looks at you...

2219
02:41:17,584 --> 02:41:19,168
Even you,

2220
02:41:19,252 --> 02:41:21,295
He sees someone
who is still a slave--

2221
02:41:21,379 --> 02:41:23,297
He left me in charge.

2222
02:41:23,381 --> 02:41:25,299
Then show you're in charge.

2223
02:41:25,383 --> 02:41:28,260
I'm the leader
while he's gone.

2224
02:41:28,344 --> 02:41:30,262
Then lead.

2225
02:41:33,933 --> 02:41:36,268
- We need a sign.
- A symbol.

2226
02:41:36,352 --> 02:41:38,687
Something to remind them
that they're God's people.

2227
02:41:38,688 --> 02:41:40,147
Something to remind them
that they're God's people.

2228
02:41:40,273 --> 02:41:43,109
(crowd speaking indistinctly)

2229
02:41:43,193 --> 02:41:45,528
<i>383</i>

2230
02:41:45,528 --> 02:41:48,280
<i>383</i>

2231
02:42:07,217 --> 02:42:08,718
Give praise!

2232
02:42:11,137 --> 02:42:13,305
Come close!

2233
02:42:15,350 --> 02:42:18,019
- Come on!
- Yeah!

2234
02:42:35,787 --> 02:42:38,331
(laughing)

2235
02:42:50,343 --> 02:42:52,011
Yeah! Aah!

2236
02:42:52,095 --> 02:42:53,096
(woman screams)

2237
02:42:56,432 --> 02:42:58,976
Celebrate with us.

2238
02:43:02,730 --> 02:43:04,773
We gave our word!

2239
02:43:06,943 --> 02:43:09,236
Tomorrow...

2240
02:43:09,362 --> 02:43:11,697
Tomorrow we sacrifice
to I am who I am.

2241
02:43:11,698 --> 02:43:14,283
Tomorrow we sacrifice
to I am who I am.

2242
02:43:44,188 --> 02:43:46,190
(chanting)

2243
02:44:03,458 --> 02:44:05,209
Aaron!

2244
02:44:08,296 --> 02:44:10,089
Aaron!

2245
02:44:17,430 --> 02:44:19,765
We had a bargain with God.

2246
02:44:19,766 --> 02:44:20,892
We had a bargain with God.

2247
02:44:20,975 --> 02:44:22,434
We made him a promise!

2248
02:44:22,518 --> 02:44:25,312
We promised to have
no other Gods but him!

2249
02:44:30,318 --> 02:44:33,070
Why, Aaron?!

2250
02:44:33,154 --> 02:44:34,697
Why?!

2251
02:44:34,781 --> 02:44:37,116
Why did you do this?

2252
02:44:37,116 --> 02:44:38,450
Why did you do this?

2253
02:44:38,493 --> 02:44:40,828
The people--
they were scared.

2254
02:44:40,828 --> 02:44:42,454
The people--
they were scared.

2255
02:44:42,538 --> 02:44:44,456
They made the idol.

2256
02:44:44,540 --> 02:44:46,875
And you let them...

2257
02:44:46,876 --> 02:44:47,918
And you let them...

2258
02:44:48,002 --> 02:44:51,338
When he chose them
to be an example to the world?

2259
02:44:53,925 --> 02:44:56,260
When he chose you
to be his priest?

2260
02:44:56,260 --> 02:44:57,928
When he chose you
to be his priest?

2261
02:44:58,012 --> 02:45:01,223
You said!

2262
02:45:03,518 --> 02:45:05,853
(all yelling)

2263
02:45:05,853 --> 02:45:06,937
(all yelling)

2264
02:45:16,781 --> 02:45:19,116
You promised!

2265
02:45:19,200 --> 02:45:21,702
You gave your word!

2266
02:45:21,786 --> 02:45:24,121
You are not our leader.

2267
02:45:24,122 --> 02:45:25,373
You are not our leader.

2268
02:45:25,498 --> 02:45:27,625
Your way is too hard!

2269
02:45:27,708 --> 02:45:30,836
- We can't worship a God we can't see!
- A God who hides from us.

2270
02:45:30,920 --> 02:45:33,005
This God is too fond of rules!

2271
02:45:33,089 --> 02:45:34,548
Just too much!

2272
02:45:34,632 --> 02:45:36,634
Why can't we choose
our own rules?

2273
02:45:36,717 --> 02:45:38,260
Are ten rules
too many to live by?!

2274
02:45:38,344 --> 02:45:40,220
These are not our rules!

2275
02:45:40,304 --> 02:45:42,514
Even if God
did not give them to you,

2276
02:45:42,557 --> 02:45:44,517
Aren't they the rules
we need to live by?

2277
02:45:44,559 --> 02:45:47,228
We don't want your God!
We don't want your rules!

2278
02:45:47,311 --> 02:45:49,396
These are not our rules!

2279
02:45:49,522 --> 02:45:51,857
Who will stand with God?

2280
02:45:51,858 --> 02:45:53,317
Who will stand with God?

2281
02:45:53,401 --> 02:45:55,736
Who will stand with God,

2282
02:45:55,736 --> 02:45:57,279
Who will stand with God,

2283
02:45:57,363 --> 02:45:59,198
and who will stand
with that?

2284
02:45:59,282 --> 02:46:00,533
I am with you!

2285
02:46:00,616 --> 02:46:02,159
I'm here.

2286
02:46:04,829 --> 02:46:06,247
Brother.

2287
02:46:08,332 --> 02:46:09,958
My brother.

2288
02:46:12,753 --> 02:46:14,755
Sister.

2289
02:46:24,056 --> 02:46:26,725
(crowd shouting)

2290
02:46:44,076 --> 02:46:46,411
(all yelling)

2291
02:46:46,412 --> 02:46:47,871
(all yelling)

2292
02:46:52,502 --> 02:46:54,128
Stop it!
Please take us back!

2293
02:46:54,212 --> 02:46:56,005
Uhh!

2294
02:47:00,676 --> 02:47:01,677
Aah!

2295
02:47:12,271 --> 02:47:14,314
(grunts)

2296
02:47:19,695 --> 02:47:21,697
Not my son!

2297
02:47:51,102 --> 02:47:53,646
What do we do
with the prisoners?

2298
02:47:57,567 --> 02:47:59,652
No quota.

2299
02:47:59,735 --> 02:48:02,487
Kill them all.

2300
02:48:02,572 --> 02:48:04,115
It's God's will.

2301
02:48:11,122 --> 02:48:13,624
(crowd screaming)

2302
02:48:15,167 --> 02:48:17,210
Aah!

2303
02:48:53,789 --> 02:48:56,124
(Moses) I, uh,
knew I had to do it

2304
02:48:56,125 --> 02:48:58,669
(Moses) I, uh,
knew I had to do it

2305
02:48:58,711 --> 02:49:01,171
or--or--or God would have
made us all pay the price.

2306
02:49:01,255 --> 02:49:03,173
(Aaron) Will he forgive us?
Will he forgive us?

2307
02:49:03,257 --> 02:49:05,634
If--if--if he doesn't,
then he can kill me, too.

2308
02:49:05,718 --> 02:49:08,804
He can Kill me, too.

2309
02:49:17,730 --> 02:49:18,647
Moses.

2310
02:49:18,731 --> 02:49:19,982
Oh!

2311
02:49:20,066 --> 02:49:22,818
Oh, oh.

2312
02:49:22,902 --> 02:49:25,237
Take your people and go.

2313
02:49:25,237 --> 02:49:27,822
Take your people and go.

2314
02:49:27,907 --> 02:49:30,242
They broke their word.

2315
02:49:30,242 --> 02:49:31,660
They broke their word.

2316
02:49:49,804 --> 02:49:52,223
Will you renew
your promise to God?

2317
02:49:52,306 --> 02:49:53,223
(all) Yes.

2318
02:49:53,307 --> 02:49:55,600
Will you?

2319
02:49:55,685 --> 02:49:57,770
Will you live
according to his laws?

2320
02:49:57,853 --> 02:49:59,271
(all) Yes!

2321
02:49:59,355 --> 02:50:02,149
- Are you sure?
- Yes!

2322
02:50:02,233 --> 02:50:04,151
- Are you sure?
- Yes!

2323
02:50:04,235 --> 02:50:06,153
Do you hear that?

2324
02:50:06,237 --> 02:50:08,572
They say yes!
They say yes again!

2325
02:50:08,572 --> 02:50:09,906
They say yes!
They say yes again!

2326
02:50:09,990 --> 02:50:12,075
I have a place for them--

2327
02:50:12,159 --> 02:50:14,703
A land flowing
with milk and honey,

2328
02:50:14,787 --> 02:50:16,705
But they must go there
without me.

2329
02:50:16,789 --> 02:50:19,792
No. No!

2330
02:50:19,875 --> 02:50:20,792
I say yes.

2331
02:50:20,876 --> 02:50:23,211
And I say no! They need you!
I need you!

2332
02:50:23,212 --> 02:50:25,172
And I say no! They need you!
I need you!

2333
02:50:25,256 --> 02:50:27,883
They need the law
that you gave them!

2334
02:50:31,303 --> 02:50:33,638
Then kill me. Kill me!

2335
02:50:33,639 --> 02:50:36,016
Then kill me. Kill me!

2336
02:50:39,729 --> 02:50:41,272
(Moses) Kill me!

2337
02:50:41,355 --> 02:50:43,690
Come to me, Moses.

2338
02:50:43,691 --> 02:50:44,942
Come to me, Moses.

2339
02:51:33,157 --> 02:51:35,284
(all) Moses! Moses!

2340
02:51:35,367 --> 02:51:38,244
Moses! Moses! Moses!

2341
02:51:38,329 --> 02:51:40,039
Moses!

2342
02:51:51,926 --> 02:51:54,261
God has written the words
of his laws in stone

2343
02:51:54,261 --> 02:51:56,179
God has written the words
of his laws in stone

2344
02:51:56,263 --> 02:51:59,516
so that we will have them
for all time.

2345
02:52:00,935 --> 02:52:03,270
You will have no other God
than the one true God...

2346
02:52:03,270 --> 02:52:05,313
You will have no other God
than the one true God...

2347
02:52:05,397 --> 02:52:08,149
And you will not
make an image of God.

2348
02:52:08,234 --> 02:52:11,111
You will not
take his name in vain.

2349
02:52:11,195 --> 02:52:13,530
You will keep
every seventh day holy for him.

2350
02:52:13,531 --> 02:52:15,824
You will keep
every seventh day holy for him.

2351
02:52:15,908 --> 02:52:18,243
You will take care
of your father and your mother.

2352
02:52:18,244 --> 02:52:19,912
You will take care
of your father and your mother.

2353
02:52:19,954 --> 02:52:21,997
You will not kill.

2354
02:52:22,081 --> 02:52:24,416
You will not commit adultery.

2355
02:52:24,416 --> 02:52:26,000
You will not commit adultery.

2356
02:52:26,085 --> 02:52:28,837
You will not steal.

2357
02:52:28,921 --> 02:52:31,256
You will not
perjure yourself.

2358
02:52:31,340 --> 02:52:32,924
I saw them together.

2359
02:52:32,967 --> 02:52:35,302
You will not be jealous
of what others have.

2360
02:52:35,302 --> 02:52:36,928
You will not be jealous
of what others have.

2361
02:52:38,556 --> 02:52:40,975
Don't agree
to these laws lightly.

2362
02:52:41,058 --> 02:52:43,852
You have seen God's power.

2363
02:52:43,936 --> 02:52:46,271
If you say yes and fail him,
he won't just punish you--

2364
02:52:46,272 --> 02:52:47,439
If you say yes and fail him,
he won't just punish you--

2365
02:52:47,523 --> 02:52:49,858
He'll punish your children

2366
02:52:49,859 --> 02:52:51,068
He'll punish your children

2367
02:52:51,151 --> 02:52:53,945
And your children's children.

2368
02:53:10,963 --> 02:53:12,965
Where are we going?

2369
02:53:13,048 --> 02:53:16,217
To the land God promised us.

2370
02:53:18,804 --> 02:53:20,889
How long will it take?

2371
02:53:20,973 --> 02:53:23,600
Until God thinks we're ready.

2372
02:53:23,684 --> 02:53:26,019
<i>383</i>

2373
02:53:26,020 --> 02:53:28,147
<i>383</i>

2374
02:53:37,531 --> 02:53:39,449
(man) Now began 40 years

2375
02:53:39,533 --> 02:53:41,868
of fighting
danger and hardship

2376
02:53:41,994 --> 02:53:44,037
for this ragged band
of ex-slaves

2377
02:53:44,121 --> 02:53:46,456
on their way
to becoming a people.

2378
02:53:46,457 --> 02:53:47,541
On their way
to becoming a people.

2379
02:54:10,147 --> 02:54:12,065
Although God
did not permit Moses

2380
02:54:12,149 --> 02:54:14,526
To enter the promised land,

2381
02:54:14,610 --> 02:54:16,945
He allowed him to see it
before he died.

2382
02:54:16,946 --> 02:54:18,113
He allowed him to see it
before he died.

2383
02:54:39,134 --> 02:54:41,469
He was buried outside it,
his grave forever unknown.

2384
02:54:41,470 --> 02:54:43,805
He was buried outside it,
his grave forever unknown.

2385
02:54:43,806 --> 02:54:45,265
He was buried outside it,
his grave forever unknown.
