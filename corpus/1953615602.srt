00:11:46,123 --> 00:11:48,448
-That's vampires.
-What?

165
00:11:48,625 --> 00:11:51,626
-Garlic. That's for vampires.
-Are you sure?

166
00:11:52,963 --> 00:11:54,505
Because I really think--

(ROARS)

168
00:11:56,425 --> 00:11:57,587
Pretty sure.

169
00:12:11,857 --> 00:12:13,684
I thought a little light might help.

170
00:12:21,366 --> 00:12:23,774
It's gone for now.

171
00:12:27,331 --> 00:12:28,362
Thank you.

172
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:31,707
I am Marius Brancusi,
owner of this circus.

173
00:12:31,877 --> 00:12:33,205
How can I repay you?

174
00:12:34,213 --> 00:12:38,045
Maybe first you should explain to us
what's going on here.

175
00:12:39,635 --> 00:12:42,719
I inherited this circus
from my uncle last year...

176
00:12:42,888 --> 00:12:45,213
...and I've been working to modernize it.

177
00:12:45,390 --> 00:12:48,226
I've been making it more stylish...

178
00:12:48,393 --> 00:12:54,229
...phasing out the animal acts,
giving it more of a theatrical flair.

179
00:12:56,735 --> 00:12:59,938
Also I cleaned the toilets,
which has been a huge improvement.

180
00:13:00,113 --> 00:13:02,569
All this has led to our latest show:

181
00:13:02,741 --> 00:13:04,568
"Celestia."

182
00:13:04,743 --> 00:13:08,575
This is so fantastic.
Did I mention I love the circus?

183
00:13:08,747 --> 00:13:11,320
Uh, several times, yes.

184
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:14,584
-But what about the werewolf?
-It's terrible.

185
00:13:14,753 --> 00:13:18,620
I thought tonight, while all my employees
are having a night on the town...

186
00:13:18,799 --> 00:13:21,254
...I might find some clues
about the beast.

187
00:13:21,426 --> 00:13:25,424
I'm certain the werewolf must be someone
who's part of the circus.

188
00:13:25,597 --> 00:13:28,267
You mean, in disguise?

189
00:13:28,433 --> 00:13:31,518
Perhaps it is not a disguise.

190
00:13:33,605 --> 00:13:36,891
You understand that I'm saying
it might be a real werewolf, right?

191
00:13:37,067 --> 00:13:40,436
-Yeah.
-It's just that I expected a bigger reaction.

192
00:13:40,612 --> 00:13:44,112
I was being so dramatic
and did I show you my pectoral muscles?

193
00:13:44,283 --> 00:13:45,445
Moving on.

194
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:51,701
All right. For the last few months, the
creature has plagued us wherever we go.

195
00:13:51,874 --> 00:13:54,115
It has scared off many of my artists.

196
00:13:54,293 --> 00:13:57,459
And in every city we visit,
it has stolen jewelry.

197
00:13:57,629 --> 00:13:59,752
-Jewelry?
-Jewelry.

198
00:13:59,923 --> 00:14:03,506
And I thought my accent was thick.
Anyway, it's very strange.

199
00:14:03,677 --> 00:14:05,966
Why would a werewolf want jewels?

200
00:14:06,138 --> 00:14:09,008
Like, maybe he's a lady werewolf.

201
00:14:10,642 --> 00:14:17,309
Because, um, you know,
girls like pretty things to have.

202
00:14:17,482 --> 00:14:18,763
It was just a thought.

203
00:14:18,942 --> 00:14:22,145
I think I remember a case like this
in 18th century Bavaria.

204
00:14:22,321 --> 00:14:26,188
-May I use your computer?
MARIUS: Of course.

205
00:14:26,950 --> 00:14:29,951
VELMA:
Bavaria, werewolf.

206
00:14:31,830 --> 00:14:34,452
Oh, here it is. It was in Ingolstadt.

207
00:14:34,625 --> 00:14:38,207
A werewolf known as "Hans"
collected certain gemstones...

208
00:14:38,378 --> 00:14:41,332
...and used them to increase his power.

209
00:14:41,507 --> 00:14:44,342
Normally, a werewolf
only becomes a wolf at the full moon.

210
00:14:44,510 --> 00:14:46,751
But with the right combination of jewels...

211
00:14:46,929 --> 00:14:50,179
...Hans was able to change from man to wolf
at any time.

212
00:14:50,349 --> 00:14:54,181
He and the werewolves he created
terrorized lngolstadt for decades.

213
00:14:54,353 --> 00:14:56,559
MARIUS: Created?
VELMA: Yes.

214
00:14:56,730 --> 00:15:00,894
Anyone who is bitten by a werewolf
and lives turns into a werewolf.

215
00:15:01,068 --> 00:15:04,234
Apparently, the Ingolstadt werewolves
claimed hundreds of victims...

216
00:15:04,404 --> 00:15:07,275
...before being driven out
by Maximilian lll.

217
00:15:07,449 --> 00:15:10,201
Wow, you guys are lucky
you didn't get bitten.

218
00:15:10,369 --> 00:15:11,863

and you're reaching for the silver bullets.

Silver bullets for werewolves...

224
00:15:33,392 --> 00:15:36,476
...garlic for vampires,
the Heimlich for Shaggy.

226
00:15:38,564 --> 00:15:40,640
How do you know
so much about werewolves?

227
00:15:40,816 --> 00:15:43,141
We solve mysteries.
It's kind of a hobby.

228
00:15:43,318 --> 00:15:48,360
A hobby? Stamp collecting is a hobby.
Solving mysteries is-- Wait.

229
00:15:48,532 --> 00:15:51,486
Maybe you could help me
investigate this werewolf.

230
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:54,198
Yes. And we could pose
as circus performers.

231
00:15:54,371 --> 00:15:55,830
Sure, why not?

232
00:15:56,290 --> 00:15:58,662
Of course, it will be very dangerous.

233
00:15:58,834 --> 00:16:02,914
-And there's the "Why not." See you.
-We have to do it, Shaggy.

234
00:16:03,088 --> 00:16:05,413
-For the good of the circus.
-Forget it.

235
00:16:05,591 --> 00:16:07,001
For the safety of the public.

236
00:16:07,176 --> 00:16:08,670
No way.

237
00:16:08,844 --> 00:16:11,086

238

Hey, and, uh, churros too?

239
00:16:15,434 --> 00:16:19,266
-And churros.
-Like, dude, heh, I'm in.

240
00:16:19,438 --> 00:16:21,845
Yeah, me too.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

241
00:16:22,024 --> 00:16:25,357
MARIUS: Well, if you're going to pass
for circus artists...

242
00:16:25,527 --> 00:16:28,018
...it's going to take a little work.

243
00:16:37,664 --> 00:16:40,238
So do any of you have circus skills?

244
00:16:40,417 --> 00:16:42,623
I took a circus-arts class last summer.

245
00:16:42,794 --> 00:16:46,080
Why am I not surprised?
And what did you learn?

246
00:16:46,256 --> 00:16:51,132
I worked out on the trapeze a bit, but, uh,
I ended up breaking a lot of bones.

247
00:16:51,303 --> 00:16:52,797
You seem to have healed well.

248
00:16:52,971 --> 00:16:55,972
What? Oh, not my bones.

249
00:16:56,141 --> 00:16:59,427
I was supposed to catch this guy
and, uh, I dropped him.

250
00:16:59,603 --> 00:17:02,806
Onto someone.
And they both fell into some other people.

251
00:17:02,981 --> 00:17:05,307
-That's terr--
-Who hit the tent support...

252
00:17:05,484 --> 00:17:09,268
...which tipped the popcorn cart,
which set fire to the audience risers...

253
00:17:09,446 --> 00:17:12,447
...which collapsed with 48 people
sitting on them.

254
00:17:12,616 --> 00:17:16,234
-Well, I'm sure it wasn't your fault.
-No, it was.

255
00:17:17,037 --> 00:17:19,824
But I did learn a valuable lesson
about the trapeze.

256
00:17:19,998 --> 00:17:21,991
-Which was?
-Don't drop people.

257
00:17:22,167 --> 00:17:24,705
Oh, and don't fall.

258
00:17:24,878 --> 00:17:27,749
Yes, those are kind of the basics.

259
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:34,220
How would you like a junior,
second-assistant, backup trapeze position?

260
00:17:34,388 --> 00:17:37,970
-It would be an honor, sir.
-You are a strange fellow.

261
00:17:38,141 --> 00:17:39,600
But I admire your neckwear.

262
00:17:39,768 --> 00:17:42,520
Anyone else have any talents
that might apply?

263
00:17:42,688 --> 00:17:45,392
When I was a kid
I used to do a little motorcycle act.

264
00:17:45,566 --> 00:17:48,685
Really? It takes years of practice to--

265
00:17:48,861 --> 00:17:50,604
It went like this.

266
00:18:05,711 --> 00:18:07,834
Right, that'll do.

267
00:18:08,463 --> 00:18:12,876
I've phased animal acts out of my circus,
but I could make an exception.

268
00:18:13,051 --> 00:18:17,630
-Your friend here seems very well-trained.
-Oh, he is.

269
00:18:17,806 --> 00:18:19,550
Shake.

270
00:18:20,434 --> 00:18:27,315
-Beg.
-Like, please, please, please.

Good boy.

272
00:18:30,777 --> 00:18:35,190
Uh, just for the sake of tradition,
maybe you should do the tricks.

273
00:18:35,365 --> 00:18:37,572
That's probably a good idea...

274
00:18:37,743 --> 00:18:40,281
...because Scooby-Doo
does more circus-y stuff than me.

275
00:18:40,454 --> 00:18:42,162

276
00:18:56,428 --> 00:18:57,673

277
00:18:59,681 --> 00:19:01,425
You taught him all this?

278
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:04,554
He tried, but, like, I just can't get it.

-Do what?

I don't know. Something.

284

-No.
