I was doing fine here.
Thanks for exposing me.

BROTHER CAVIL:
You weren't doing fine,
thank goodness.

10
00:01:21,159 --> 00:01:22,454
If you'd wiped
out this fleet,

11
00:01:22,494 --> 00:01:24,581
you'd have made us
even more irredeemable

12
00:01:24,621 --> 00:01:25,999
in the eyes
of our parents.

13
00:01:26,039 --> 00:01:28,547
No, I'd have proved us
to be superior.

14
00:01:28,625 --> 00:01:32,294
No, no, see,
I've figured out
what went wrong.

15
00:01:32,379 --> 00:01:34,257
Well, that's a very useful
revelation to have

16
00:01:34,297 --> 00:01:37,758
when you're standing
in front of an airlock.

17
00:01:38,927 --> 00:01:41,139
Nonetheless…
Our failure is obvious.

18
00:01:41,179 --> 00:01:45,769
We had our foot on the throat
of humanity and we failed
to step down hard enough.

19
00:01:45,809 --> 00:01:46,895
That was our error.

20
00:01:46,935 --> 00:01:49,773
Have you learned
nothing in all this
time in this fleet?

21
00:01:49,813 --> 00:01:53,707
Because I learned
a great deal among
the rebels on Caprica.

22
00:01:54,192 --> 00:01:57,624
Every killing
of a human being
was a grievous error.

23
00:01:58,613 --> 00:02:00,117
Do you want to know why?

24
00:02:00,157 --> 00:02:01,240
I really don't.

25
00:02:01,324 --> 00:02:03,954
Are you certain?
Because it's fascinating.

26
00:02:03,994 --> 00:02:07,288
Listen, Brother,
if you're right,

27
00:02:07,372 --> 00:02:10,836
that means this whole project
was doomed from the beginning.

28
00:02:10,876 --> 00:02:13,669
Yes.
From the very top.

29
00:02:51,708 --> 00:02:52,708
CAVIL: Dad.

30
00:02:54,377 --> 00:02:55,544

31
00:02:56,922 --> 00:03:01,050

they won't survive
the death of the Colonies.

35

Life among humans
will have humbled them.

36
00:03:14,898 --> 00:03:17,316
When they resurrect,
they'll return

37
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:20,697
with apologies tumbling
from their lips like jewels.

38
00:03:20,737 --> 00:03:23,697
Yes. Be prepared for
some very sticky hugs.

39

a yen to experience a nuclear
holocaust in person.

40

Perhaps with our dear
mother here,

41
00:03:32,916 --> 00:03:37,044
I'll slide in another tub,
and we can download
side-by-side,

hit on Picon.

yourself if you want.

But I'll be on Caprica,
making final arrangements
with our contact.

45

So if you're going to go,
go soon.

to know that the final results
of the CNP project

47
00:04:25,802 --> 00:04:29,597
are working close
to 95% efficiency
throughout the Fleet.

48

49
00:04:32,183 --> 00:04:33,934

50

I doubt you would've
ever completed
the project without me.

51
00:04:37,814 --> 00:04:39,899
Yes. Well,
you helped a bit.

52
00:04:39,983 --> 00:04:42,067
I rewrote
half your algorithms.

53
00:04:42,152 --> 00:04:43,530
All right,
you were extremely helpful,

54
00:04:43,570 --> 00:04:46,157
but let's not forget,
you got something out of it.

All that poking around
inside the defense mainframe.

56
00:04:51,411 --> 00:04:55,792
It should give you
a huge advantage bidding
for the contract next year.

57

You know that's not
really why I did it.

58
00:04:58,251 --> 00:05:00,495
No. You did it
'cause you love me.

59
00:05:00,629 --> 00:05:03,464
I have to go.
I'm meeting someone.

60

I'm insanely jealous.

00:05:10,513 --> 00:05:12,348

you'd get here.

detonate the charges.

I mean, these humans,
there are so few of them.
They're no threat.

501

They are manifestly
a threat.

502
00:43:10,249 --> 00:43:13,921
They're a threat
because of the power they
have to make you do this.

503

Of all Cylons,
you should see that.

they think that? That's crazy.

there are those who think
this current devastation

541

is punishment
for man's sins.

Is that what you believe,
Brother?

I don't believe
it's punishment
from the Gods, no.

544

But perhaps…

545
00:49:06,564 --> 00:49:10,788
Perhaps the Cylons

that the Gods once had.

about the courageous Five

who weren't supposed to be
alive in the first place.

578
00:51:14,441 --> 00:51:20,029
No one was supposed
to be alive! Our people were
supposed to be positioned

not mop up afterwards.

the Defense Minister's

581

and one of the Sixes
was a prostitute.

But the only one
in a position to do
any frakking damage

583
00:51:36,380 --> 00:51:39,416
was a Five on this ship,
and he frakked it up!

still has these

for a moment

587

that I'm gonna be moved
by the sweet, adorable fact
that you married one of them.

into the defense mainframe.

that you're exposed

you really are.

I promised to hear
his confession,

keep our promises.

Okay, go, go.

so far ahead?

Doctor, it's all right.
It's a lie.

676
00:59:00,240 --> 00:59:02,352
The photograph
was a fake.
What?

677
00:59:05,453 --> 00:59:08,455
It was almost seamless,
but your face,

678
00:59:08,540 --> 00:59:10,710

it was all a fake.

679
00:59:10,750 --> 00:59:13,547
I went back, I re-ran
all the security checks.

680
00:59:13,587 --> 00:59:18,132
This time I found
markers which pointed
to photo manipulation.

681
00:59:18,216 --> 00:59:21,978
They weren't apparent
until the photo
was fully resolved.

682
00:59:26,433 --> 00:59:27,558
Thank you.

683
00:59:28,351 --> 00:59:31,314
It was really nothing, Doctor.
Once the photos
were fully resolved,

684
00:59:31,354 --> 00:59:35,050
it was almost too easy,
like she wanted
to be found out.

She's fast.
She's almost beyond human.

688
00:59:51,458 --> 00:59:53,086
How did she get
off of the ship?
Got me.

689
00:59:53,126 --> 00:59:55,005
There's been no ships
coming or going.
I gave you an order.

690
00:59:55,045 --> 00:59:56,256
I had two Marines
tailing her.

691
00:59:56,296 --> 00:59:59,009
They say they went
around a corner
and she was gone.

692
00:59:59,049 --> 01:00:00,552
Every ship in the Fleet
has reported in, sir.

693
01:00:00,592 --> 01:00:01,595
There's no sign
of her.

694
01:00:01,635 --> 01:00:05,199
That's unacceptable.
She was here.
She was right here.

695

She didn't just vanish.

Baltar, he helped us
so much on Caprica…

704

Are you attracted
to this human?
No.

705
01:00:46,513 --> 01:00:47,974
'Cause the other Six
got addicted to him.

706
01:00:48,014 --> 01:00:53,602
I'm not addicted!
Baltar's a brilliant man, yes,
but you should've seen me.

707
01:00:53,687 --> 01:00:55,899
I was brutal with him.
I pushed him.

01:00:55,939 --> 01:00:57,106
You pushed him.

709

you would have sent him
through a wall.

once in the head?

The only way that
I could get this done

843
01:11:34,827 --> 01:11:37,370
was to turn myself
into a Centurion.

844

turning hard.

845
01:11:43,169 --> 01:11:48,317
I could feel the bullets
moving through the channels
under my hard metal skin.

846

my heartbeat.

01:27:14,766 --> 01:27:18,528
Well, no.
Barolay was there and
she was gonna see me run.

1008
01:27:21,898 --> 01:27:26,902
And suddenly I find myself
worrying about my own
frakking reputation.

1009
01:27:28,947 --> 01:27:30,614
So, I didn't run.

1010
01:27:32,200 --> 01:27:35,962
And that's my confession.
I'm a godsdamn coward,
Brother.

1011
01:27:39,249 --> 01:27:40,958
Well,
I suppose you were.

1012
01:27:42,377 --> 01:27:44,169
But what about now?

1013
01:27:46,464 --> 01:27:48,716
I'm not gonna run anymore.

1014
01:27:51,511 --> 01:27:54,745
Maybe I'm stronger
or maybe I'm just
more insane.

1015
01:27:56,474 --> 01:28:00,144
This whole experience
has changed you
for the better.

1016
01:28:00,228 --> 01:28:01,520
You've learned.

1017
01:28:02,606 --> 01:28:03,942
You know,
at the end of a confession,

1018
01:28:03,982 --> 01:28:07,276
sometimes there's
an ending or, you know…

1019
01:28:07,360 --> 01:28:11,322
Yes, fine. You are absolved
in the example of the Gods.

1020
01:28:12,949 --> 01:28:18,412
Now, Sam, listen,
given that this holocaust

1021
01:28:19,915 --> 01:28:21,793
was a journey
of learning for you…

1022
01:28:21,833 --> 01:28:23,753
Journey? I don't know
if it was a journey…

1023
01:28:23,793 --> 01:28:26,837
Well, given that,
it can…

1024
01:28:28,340 --> 01:28:29,965
Can you

1025
01:28:33,011 --> 01:28:35,846
forgive the Cylons?

1026
01:28:36,973 --> 01:28:38,515
Because if you can,

1027
01:28:38,642 --> 01:28:41,646
that's really transcendent.
I know you didn't
just say that.

1028
01:28:41,686 --> 01:28:43,273
I mean,
they must've
had a purpose.

1029
01:28:43,313 --> 01:28:46,440
Something must've
made them…
Made them what?

1030
01:28:46,524 --> 01:28:49,195
End everything?
Destroy billions
of souls?

1031
01:28:49,235 --> 01:28:51,740
No, frak, no.
Humanity had so much sin.

1032
01:28:51,780 --> 01:28:53,034
Are you kidding me?

1033
01:28:53,073 --> 01:28:55,327
They made you put
all these dead…
Wait a second.

1034
01:28:55,367 --> 01:28:58,330
on your shoulders.
Are you defending them?
Listen, Brother,

1035
01:28:58,370 --> 01:28:59,748
I'm gonna pretend
you didn't say that, okay?

01:28:59,788 --> 01:29:02,706
I'm gonna pretend
I didn't hear any of that.

01:42:44,278 --> 01:42:48,156
Cylon and man
will now go
their separate ways.

1174
01:42:48,240 --> 01:42:49,324
No harm done.

1175
01:42:49,408 --> 01:42:50,742
ADAMA: No harm?

1176
01:42:51,076 --> 01:42:52,830
You completely
annihilated our race

1177
01:42:52,870 --> 01:42:55,079
and destroyed
our civilization.

1178
01:42:55,790 --> 01:42:58,335
Now, if you're gonna start
pointing fingers…

1179
01:42:58,375 --> 01:43:00,794
You see, we're not like you.

1180
01:43:00,878 --> 01:43:03,966
We can admit our mistakes,
and we're not afraid
of change.

1181
01:43:04,006 --> 01:43:07,383
New marching orders
by your one true God?

1182
01:43:08,052 --> 01:43:09,677
There is no God.

1183
01:43:10,346 --> 01:43:13,350
Supernatural divinities
are the primitive's answer

1184
01:43:13,390 --> 01:43:15,436
for why the sun
goes down at night.

1185
01:43:15,476 --> 01:43:18,105
At least that's what
we've been telling
the others for years.

1186
01:43:18,145 --> 01:43:20,483
We can't really prove it
one way or the other,
of course.

1187
01:43:20,523 --> 01:43:23,031
TIGH: Enough.
Let's airlock them both.

1188
01:43:27,321 --> 01:43:28,780
ADAMA: Airlock them.

1189
01:43:41,752 --> 01:43:43,005
Hold it at the door.

1190
01:43:43,045 --> 01:43:44,101
GUARD: Yes, sir.

1191
01:43:45,172 --> 01:43:46,756
TIGH: Check the hall.

1192
01:43:47,758 --> 01:43:49,509
Stop. Stop.

1193
01:43:52,471 --> 01:43:56,563
Sweep the halls.
Clear up ahead,
there are too many civilians.

1194
01:44:07,069 --> 01:44:08,903
Not how I imagined it.

1195
01:44:08,988 --> 01:44:10,308
(SIGHS) No, Brother.

1196
01:44:10,322 --> 01:44:11,614
All right.

1197
01:44:48,277 --> 01:44:50,904
Is there a Resurrection ship
in range?

1198
01:44:50,988 --> 01:44:52,447
(ALARM BLARING)

1199
01:44:52,531 --> 01:44:55,536
Yes, Brother.
But first,
we're gonna die in a vacuum.

1200
01:44:55,576 --> 01:44:57,872
There's a 170-foot
launch tube in front of us.

1201
01:44:57,912 --> 01:45:01,674
We might die of our injuries
before we get to the vacuum.

1202
01:45:03,500 --> 01:45:04,918
I don't like you.

1203
01:45:05,002 --> 01:45:06,419
I understand that.

1204
01:45:06,587 --> 01:45:09,884
Do you really believe
it was a mistake
to attack the humans?

1205
01:45:09,924 --> 01:45:11,841
Rather intensely, yes.

1206
01:45:12,593 --> 01:45:14,555
You know that
when we download
among the others,

1207
01:45:14,595 --> 01:45:17,057
your strange ideas
will be shouted down.

1208
01:45:17,097 --> 01:45:20,477
Ideas only seem strange
until you try them on,
Brother.

1209
01:45:20,517 --> 01:45:23,314
We had a temper tantrum
in the form of a cataclysm

1210
01:45:23,354 --> 01:45:27,318
because we wanted them
to treasure us, the Ones,
more than humanity.

1211
01:45:27,358 --> 01:45:29,612
More than their
own history and blood.

1212
01:45:29,652 --> 01:45:33,991
(SCOFFS) We didn't want
to be loved. We wanted
to be treated fairly.

1213
01:45:34,031 --> 01:45:36,616
We wanted to be
held to a bosom,

1214
01:45:36,700 --> 01:45:40,915
to be petted and perfumed
and told we were
the princes of the universe.

1215
01:45:40,955 --> 01:45:43,626
(SCOFFS) Yes, well,
if the humans were gone…

1216
01:45:43,666 --> 01:45:45,792
Our parents
would mourn them.

1217
01:45:45,876 --> 01:45:47,856
They'd love them more,
anyway.

1218
01:45:49,004 --> 01:45:52,674
I am going to see to it
that you get boxed.

1219
01:45:52,758 --> 01:45:57,246
And then I'm going
to prepare to wipe out
humanity once and for all.

1220
01:46:00,099 --> 01:46:03,184
The anticipation
is really unpleasant.

1221
01:46:05,980 --> 01:46:07,063
Yes.

1222
01:46:23,372 --> 01:46:25,081

I don't want to be human!

1224
01:46:30,421 --> 01:46:32,071
I want to see gamma rays.

1225
01:46:32,131 --> 01:46:35,174
I want to hear x-rays,
and I want to…

1226
01:46:35,259 --> 01:46:37,677
I want to smell dark matter.

1227
01:46:37,761 --> 01:46:40,057
I want
to reach out with something
other than these

1228
01:46:40,097 --> 01:46:42,432
prehensile paws

1229
01:46:42,516 --> 01:46:46,310
and feel the solar
wind of a supernova
flowing over me.

1230
01:46:48,439 --> 01:46:50,148
I'm a machine,

1231
01:46:51,191 --> 01:46:53,276
and I could know much more.
