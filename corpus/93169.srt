00:00:00,465 --> 00:00:04,372
<i>Soul
Surrendering your soul</i>

2
00:00:04,414 --> 00:00:07,960
<i>The heart in you not whole</i>

3
00:00:08,044 --> 00:00:11,757
<i>For love</i>

4
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:16,221
<i>For love</i>

5
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:25,191
<i>Walked out</i>

6
00:00:25,274 --> 00:00:30,656
<i>Cast into the dark</i>

7
00:00:32,659 --> 00:00:39,751
<i>Branded with a mark</i>

8
00:00:39,793 --> 00:00:43,589
<i>Of shame</i>

9
00:00:43,673 --> 00:00:49,263
<i>Of Cain</i>

10
00:00:52,851 --> 00:00:55,062
If I could just go back.

11
00:00:56,189 --> 00:00:58,567
If I could rub everything out,

12
00:00:58,650 --> 00:01:00,695
starting with myself.

13
00:01:02,656 --> 00:01:05,284
Starting with borrowing
a jacket.

14
00:01:05,367 --> 00:01:09,122
<i>Oh, such fleeting
paradise</i>

15
00:01:09,164 --> 00:01:12,794
<i>Such innocent delight</i>

16
00:01:12,877 --> 00:01:17,424
<i>To love</i>

17
00:01:17,508 --> 00:01:20,303
<i>Be loved</i>

18
00:01:20,387 --> 00:01:25,226
<i>A lullaby</i>

19
00:01:26,311 --> 00:01:34,613
<i>Then silence</i>

20
00:01:38,076 --> 00:01:41,247
- Frances, that was lovely.
- I'm so glad. Thank you.

21
00:01:41,330 --> 00:01:44,084
Congratulations.

22
00:01:44,167 --> 00:01:46,837
Marvelous.
Most enjoyable.

23
00:01:46,879 --> 00:01:49,382
Herbert Greenleaf.
My wife, Emily.

24
00:01:49,466 --> 00:01:50,884
Thank you.
Tom Ripley.

25
00:01:50,967 --> 00:01:53,304
- How do you do?
- You were at Princeton.

26
00:01:53,387 --> 00:01:56,266
Most likely you'll know our son,
Dick. Dickie Greenleaf.

27
00:01:56,349 --> 00:01:58,268
I couldn't help
Noticing your jacket.

28
00:01:58,352 --> 00:02:00,104
Yes.

29
00:02:00,188 --> 00:02:03,233
Class of'56.

30
00:02:03,317 --> 00:02:06,154
How is Dickie?

31
00:02:06,237 --> 00:02:08,573
We've enjoyed meeting you.

32
00:02:08,657 --> 00:02:11,160
I do hope that you'll
come out and see us.

33
00:02:11,243 --> 00:02:14,247
- Thank you. That's very kind.
- Both of you.

34
00:02:14,331 --> 00:02:17,460
- Herbert?
- Yes, yes. I very much hope so.

35
00:02:17,543 --> 00:02:20,714
Of course, Dickie's idea
of music is jazz.

36
00:02:20,797 --> 00:02:23,134
- Oh, dear.
- He has a saxophone.

37
00:02:23,217 --> 00:02:26,179
To my ear,
jazz is just noise.

38
00:02:26,263 --> 00:02:28,390
Just an insolent noise.

39
00:02:28,432 --> 00:02:31,436
- Very nice to meet you.
- And you.

40
00:02:31,478 --> 00:02:33,397
- Sir.
- We'll see you at the shipyard.

41
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:35,399
- I hope to.
- Good.

42
00:02:37,027 --> 00:02:39,279
I have to run!
I'm very late!

43
00:02:41,115 --> 00:02:44,119
- Ah, you were great!
- You were great.

44
00:02:44,202 --> 00:02:46,914
Darling couple,
aren't they?

45
00:02:46,956 --> 00:02:50,001
Yes, they are.
Exceptional young man.

46
00:02:52,213 --> 00:02:54,466
- Thanks a lot for the jacket.
- Thanks for filling in for me.

47
00:02:54,549 --> 00:02:56,635
Take care of that wrist.
Bye, Fran.

48
00:03:04,228 --> 00:03:07,148
Believe me.
Buy I.B.M. now, before it splits.

49
00:03:07,232 --> 00:03:09,151
You'll make yourself
a fortune.

50
00:03:09,234 --> 00:03:11,154
You think so?

51
00:03:47,450 --> 00:03:49,369
Sorry.
Sorry.

52
00:03:50,496 --> 00:03:52,415
Sorry.

53
00:03:52,498 --> 00:03:55,836
You've probably
Heard Dickie's been living in Italy.

54
00:03:55,919 --> 00:03:58,631
Mongibello.
South of Naples.

55
00:03:58,715 --> 00:04:00,926
No kind of place
at all.

56
00:04:01,009 --> 00:04:02,928
- Good morning, sir.
- Frank.

57
00:04:03,012 --> 00:04:06,349
Marge,
his young lady,

58
00:04:06,391 --> 00:04:08,602
is supposedly writing
some kind of book.

59
00:04:08,686 --> 00:04:10,605
God only knows
what he does.

60
00:04:10,688 --> 00:04:14,693
By all accounts, they spend the whole
time on the beach or in a sailboat.

61
00:04:14,777 --> 00:04:18,240
That's my son's talent...
spending his allowance.

62
00:04:18,323 --> 00:04:21,661
Could you ever conceive
of going to Italy, Tom?

63
00:04:21,744 --> 00:04:25,040
Persuade my son
to come home?

64
00:04:26,584 --> 00:04:28,503
I'd pay you...

65
00:04:28,586 --> 00:04:31,507
a thousand dollars.

66
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:37,347
Well, I have always wanted
to go to Europe, sir, but...

67
00:04:37,431 --> 00:04:41,269
Good. Now you can go
for a reason.

68
00:04:56,706 --> 00:04:59,084
Count Basie.

69
00:04:59,167 --> 00:05:02,421
Duke Ellington?
I don't know.

70
00:05:04,424 --> 00:05:06,802
I don't know.

71
00:05:08,763 --> 00:05:11,057
I don't know.

72
00:05:17,190 --> 00:05:19,485
Dizzy Gillespie.

73
00:05:19,568 --> 00:05:22,989
My funny Valentine

74
00:05:23,073 --> 00:05:24,950
My funny Valentine.

75
00:05:24,992 --> 00:05:29,247
Sweet, funny Valentine

76
00:05:29,331 --> 00:05:32,043
I don't even know
If this is a man or a woman.

77
00:05:50,191 --> 00:05:52,193
Charlie Parker?

78
00:05:52,235 --> 00:05:55,114
Charlie Parker.
I know it. It's Bird.

79
00:05:57,700 --> 00:05:59,953
Yes!

80
00:06:23,358 --> 00:06:26,446
- Here. I'll take it.
- Thanks.

81
00:06:26,529 --> 00:06:28,657
That thousand bucks
should come in handy.

82
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:30,701
- Yes, sir.
- I'll get that.

83
00:06:35,374 --> 00:06:40,005
- Thank you.
- Sir. You're gonna have a great trip.

84
00:06:40,088 --> 00:06:42,967
Mr. Greenleaf is personal
friends with the Cunard people.

85
00:06:48,557 --> 00:06:52,437
I can tell you, the Greenleaf name
opens a lot of doors.

86
00:07:29,485 --> 00:07:33,323
- Do you speak English?
- What you name, please?

87
00:07:33,407 --> 00:07:35,659
- Ripley.
- Follow me. No problem.

88
00:07:35,743 --> 00:07:38,622
- Here, Signor Ripley.
- Okay.

89
00:07:39,831 --> 00:07:41,751
Uh, there.
That one.

90
00:07:41,834 --> 00:07:43,920
- This one.
- Wait, is that all? Count them.

91
00:07:44,003 --> 00:07:47,132
Attenzione.
Just one suitcase, Signor Ripley?

92
00:07:47,174 --> 00:07:50,470
- Si.
- Attenzione.

93
00:08:05,907 --> 00:08:08,326
- What's your secret?
- Excuse me?

94
00:08:08,410 --> 00:08:11,539
No, it's just that...
You are American, aren't you?

95
00:08:11,622 --> 00:08:13,708
No, it's just that...

96
00:08:13,792 --> 00:08:18,339
I have so much luggage,
and you're so, um, streamlined.

97
00:08:18,423 --> 00:08:20,801
It's, you know,
humiliating.

98
00:08:22,928 --> 00:08:24,847
I'm Meredith,
by the way.

99
00:08:24,931 --> 00:08:29,478
- Hello, I'm Dickie.
- Meredith Randall.

100
00:08:29,562 --> 00:08:32,649
- Um, Dickie Greenleaf.
- Hello.

101
00:08:34,652 --> 00:08:37,656
You're not
the shipping Greenleafs.

102
00:08:37,739 --> 00:08:40,075
Oh, trying not to be.

103
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:41,828
Trying to jump ship.

104
00:08:41,911 --> 00:08:45,416
So, uh, did they put
your cases in the wrong pile?

105
00:08:45,499 --> 00:08:49,588
It's just that, uh,
you were in the "R" stand.

106
00:08:49,671 --> 00:08:53,843
I thought
I saw you there.

107
00:08:53,926 --> 00:08:56,889
My father wants me
back in New York.

108
00:08:56,972 --> 00:08:59,767
He builds boats.
I'd rather sail them.

109
00:08:59,809 --> 00:09:02,396
So I travel
under my mother's name.

110
00:09:02,479 --> 00:09:05,858
- Which is...
- Emily.

111
00:09:05,942 --> 00:09:08,111
I'm just kidding.

112
00:09:09,446 --> 00:09:11,616
You know,
the funny thing is,

113
00:09:11,699 --> 00:09:14,202
I'm not Randall either.

114
00:09:15,371 --> 00:09:17,331
I'm Logue.

115
00:09:17,373 --> 00:09:20,419
- As in...
- As in the textile Logues.

116
00:09:20,502 --> 00:09:23,297
Trying to
shrug off the dress.

117
00:09:23,339 --> 00:09:25,467
- I travel under my mother's name too.
- Randall.

118
00:09:25,550 --> 00:09:27,511
Right.

119
00:09:27,553 --> 00:09:30,640
- So, Rome, Rome, Rome.
- Oh.

120
00:09:32,309 --> 00:09:36,064
- We're partners in disguise. Bye.
- Bye.

121
00:10:53,121 --> 00:10:55,416
"The fiancée has
a face. "

122
00:11:19,697 --> 00:11:21,741
Bird.

123
00:11:25,329 --> 00:11:27,957
"This is my face. "

124
00:12:01,292 --> 00:12:04,212
So I guess you didn't
Look at my new chapter.

125
00:12:04,296 --> 00:12:06,340
I will, Marge.
I promise.

126
00:12:06,423 --> 00:12:08,384
It's just been too hot.

127
00:12:18,272 --> 00:12:20,858
If I make dinner at my place tonight,
maybe you could look at it then.

128
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:23,236
Dickie Greenleaf?

129
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:26,699
- Who's that?
- It's Tom. Tom Ripley.

130
00:12:26,741 --> 00:12:28,618
Tom Ripley?

131
00:12:28,702 --> 00:12:32,206
- We were at Princeton together.
- Okay.

132
00:12:32,290 --> 00:12:35,085
Did we know each other?

133
00:12:35,168 --> 00:12:37,839
Hello.
Well, I knew you, so...

134
00:12:37,922 --> 00:12:39,883
I suppose
you must have known me.

135
00:12:41,468 --> 00:12:43,429
Princeton's like a fog.

136
00:12:43,471 --> 00:12:46,934
America's like a fog.

137
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:50,313
This is Marge Sherwood.
Tom... Sorry, what is it?

138
00:12:50,396 --> 00:12:51,857
- Ripley.
- How do you do?

139
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:55,319
How do you do, Marge?

140
00:12:55,403 --> 00:12:57,530
- What are you doing in Mongi?
- Nothing.

141
00:12:57,614 --> 00:12:59,533
Nothing much.

142
00:12:59,616 --> 00:13:01,911
Just passing through.

143
00:13:01,995 --> 00:13:05,249
- Passing through?
- Yeah.

144
00:13:05,332 --> 00:13:07,293
You're so white.

145
00:13:09,629 --> 00:13:12,216
Did you ever see a guy
so white, Marge?

146
00:13:12,299 --> 00:13:14,260
Gray, actually.

147
00:13:14,344 --> 00:13:16,847
It's just an undercoat.

148
00:13:16,930 --> 00:13:20,518
- Say again?
- You know, a primer.

149
00:13:22,938 --> 00:13:24,774
That's funny.

150
00:13:24,857 --> 00:13:27,778
Margie likes that
'cause she's so white too.

151
00:13:27,819 --> 00:13:29,947
Yes, I do,
and you're not funny.

152
00:13:29,989 --> 00:13:31,950
You should come and have lunch
with us before you go.

153
00:13:31,991 --> 00:13:34,787
- Yes, Dickie?
- Sure, anytime.

154
00:13:34,828 --> 00:13:37,290
Well,

155
00:13:37,332 --> 00:13:39,292
coincidence.

156
00:13:43,715 --> 00:13:46,009
I don't remember him.

157
00:13:46,093 --> 00:13:48,179
That's so funny.

158
00:13:54,228 --> 00:13:56,481
Silvana! Hey!

159
00:13:57,983 --> 00:14:00,444
I've been looking all over for you.

160
00:14:00,486 --> 00:14:02,364
Where've you been hiding?

161
00:14:02,447 --> 00:14:05,326
Today you're looking for me.
Where've you been the rest of the week?

162
00:14:05,409 --> 00:14:08,789
You're always working.
Come on. Get on.

163
00:14:08,830 --> 00:14:11,667
With the American girl?

164
00:14:11,709 --> 00:14:13,670
- Hold on to me.
- I hate you.

165
00:14:13,711 --> 00:14:17,383
- Huh?
- I hate you!

166
00:14:19,052 --> 00:14:21,013
Did you suddenly forget where I lived?

167
00:14:21,054 --> 00:14:23,224
I know. I'm late.
I'm a swine.

168
00:14:23,307 --> 00:14:25,226
- It's 4:00.
- I just woke up.

169
00:14:25,310 --> 00:14:27,771
- Ohh.
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

170
00:14:27,855 --> 00:14:30,525
- You just woke up.
- Fausto and I took the boat out.

171
00:14:30,608 --> 00:14:34,238
We were fishing, and then it was dawn,
and we caught absolutely nothing.

172
00:14:34,321 --> 00:14:38,493
Mmm, yes, well,
we ate everything without you.

173
00:14:38,535 --> 00:14:40,663
- We?
- Yes.

174
00:14:40,746 --> 00:14:43,667
- Tom Ripley's here.
- Who?

175
00:14:45,711 --> 00:14:48,965
- Tom. Hello.
- Hi.

176
00:14:49,048 --> 00:14:51,510
- Hello.
- How are you? Thought you'd disappeared.

177
00:14:51,593 --> 00:14:54,556
- We were gonna send out a search party.
- No.

178
00:14:54,597 --> 00:14:58,811
- No, still here.
- Tom was telling me about his journey.

179
00:14:58,894 --> 00:15:02,858
Made me laugh so hard
I almost got a nosebleed.

180
00:15:02,941 --> 00:15:06,529
- Is that good?
- Shut up.

181
00:15:06,613 --> 00:15:09,575
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

182
00:15:09,616 --> 00:15:12,245
I'm despicable.
But I love you.

183
00:15:12,328 --> 00:15:15,249
- Do you love me? Do you love me?
- I'm intruding.

184
00:15:15,332 --> 00:15:17,835
Can you mix
a martini?

185
00:15:20,047 --> 00:15:23,176
- Sure.
- I'll do it.

186
00:15:23,259 --> 00:15:26,179
- Ohh.
- I make a fabulous martini.

187
00:15:30,977 --> 00:15:34,357
Everybody should have
one talent. What's yours?

188
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:36,526
Forging signatures,

189
00:15:36,609 --> 00:15:39,655
telling lies, impersonating
practically anybody.

190
00:15:39,738 --> 00:15:43,827
That's three. Nobody should have
more than one talent.

191
00:15:44,953 --> 00:15:47,165
Okay,
do an impression.

192
00:15:47,248 --> 00:15:49,751
- Now?
- Yeah.

193
00:15:49,835 --> 00:15:52,922
The only talent my son has...

194
00:15:53,005 --> 00:15:55,467
is for cashing
his allowance.

195
00:15:57,636 --> 00:15:59,973
- What?
- Oh, I like to sail.

196
00:16:00,056 --> 00:16:01,975
Believe me,
I love to sail.

197
00:16:02,017 --> 00:16:04,020
- Instead, I make boats.
- Stop!

198
00:16:04,103 --> 00:16:06,481
- Other people sail them.
- It's too much!

199
00:16:06,523 --> 00:16:08,525
You're making all the hairs
on my neck stand up.

200
00:16:08,609 --> 00:16:11,988
Oh, yes. Jazz.
Oh, jazz. Let's face it.

201
00:16:12,072 --> 00:16:15,618
It's just, uh...
It's just insolent noise.

202
00:16:15,701 --> 00:16:17,704
I feel like he's here.

203
00:16:17,787 --> 00:16:21,208
- Horrible, like the old bastard's here.
- Good.

204
00:16:21,292 --> 00:16:23,169
That's brilliant.

205
00:16:23,211 --> 00:16:25,923
Brilliant!
How do you know him?

206
00:16:26,006 --> 00:16:27,800
Oh, I met him in New York.

207
00:16:27,842 --> 00:16:30,095
Marge!
Marge, this is scary.

208
00:16:30,178 --> 00:16:32,473
You've got to hear this.
Meet my father,

209
00:16:32,514 --> 00:16:34,726
Herbert Richard Greenleaf I.

210
00:16:34,809 --> 00:16:38,689
Pleasure to meet you.
Dickie's made a fine catch.

211
00:16:38,772 --> 00:16:41,317
- Uncanny!
- I know Emily thinks so.

212
00:16:41,359 --> 00:16:43,654
- I don't get it.
- It's uncanny.

213
00:16:43,695 --> 00:16:46,824
Could you ever conceive
of going to Italy, Tom,

214
00:16:46,908 --> 00:16:49,870
and, uh, bringing him back?

215
00:16:49,912 --> 00:16:52,123
- What?
- I'd pay you.

216
00:16:52,206 --> 00:16:54,125
If you would go
to Italy,

217
00:16:54,209 --> 00:16:58,172
persuade my son to come home,
I'd pay you a thousand dollars.

218
00:17:00,842 --> 00:17:02,845
I'm never going back.

219
00:17:02,887 --> 00:17:05,599
To actually hire somebody
to come all the way here...

220
00:17:05,682 --> 00:17:07,601
to drag me back home...

221
00:17:07,685 --> 00:17:09,812
Got to be a little
insane, doesn't he?

222
00:17:09,896 --> 00:17:12,399
Ciao, Fausto.

223
00:17:16,404 --> 00:17:18,907
- This is Tom.
- Ciao, Tom.

224
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:23,705
- I'm never going back.
- No, I think...

225
00:17:23,747 --> 00:17:25,749
Your mother, her illness,
I think that's...

226
00:17:25,791 --> 00:17:28,878
It's got nothing to do
with my mother.

227
00:17:28,962 --> 00:17:32,633
She's had leukem...
This is what makes me boil about him.

228
00:17:32,717 --> 00:17:36,305
He wants me back.
He wants me back.

229
00:17:36,388 --> 00:17:38,766
- It's got nothing to do with my mother.
- Look, I don't know...

230
00:17:38,808 --> 00:17:40,769
Go back.
Go back to New York.

231
00:17:40,810 --> 00:17:42,896
Or call him, if you can find
a telephone that works,

232
00:17:42,938 --> 00:17:47,444
and tell him wild horses wouldn't
drag me back to him or his shipyard.

233
00:17:49,905 --> 00:17:52,909
- Hi, Tom.
- Hi.

234
00:17:52,993 --> 00:17:55,287
Marge, Tom's saying good-bye.

235
00:17:55,371 --> 00:17:57,415
Oh, I'll come down.

236
00:17:58,917 --> 00:18:01,337
So, uh, did you
speak to my father?

237
00:18:01,420 --> 00:18:03,631
Oh, you were right...
about the telephones.

238
00:18:03,715 --> 00:18:05,634
- I told you.
- There are no lines.

239
00:18:05,717 --> 00:18:08,471
- There's some problem.
- That's Italy.

240
00:18:10,181 --> 00:18:14,312
Tom. You're off?
What are your plans?

241
00:18:14,395 --> 00:18:16,815
Oh, back, I suppose,
as slow as I can. Oh!

242
00:18:17,608 --> 00:18:20,570
This bag!

243
00:18:21,988 --> 00:18:25,159
Hey.
You like jazz.

244
00:18:25,242 --> 00:18:26,911
I love jazz.

245
00:18:29,456 --> 00:18:31,417
This is the best.

246
00:18:31,459 --> 00:18:34,588
Baker, Rollins.

247
00:18:34,629 --> 00:18:37,842
Marge says she likes jazz,
but she thinks Glenn Miller's jazz.

248
00:18:37,925 --> 00:18:39,886
- I never said that!
- Bird.

249
00:18:39,970 --> 00:18:42,222
That's jazz.

250
00:18:42,306 --> 00:18:44,600
Bird? Ask me
the name of my sailboat.

251
00:18:44,642 --> 00:18:46,645
I don't know. What's the name
Of your sailboat?

252
00:18:46,686 --> 00:18:48,898
Look! Look!
Bird!

253
00:18:48,981 --> 00:18:51,693
Which is ridiculous. Boats are female.

254
00:18:51,776 --> 00:18:55,156
Everyone knows you can't
call a boat after a man.

255
00:18:55,197 --> 00:18:58,368
- He's not a man. He's a god.
- Okay, we're going to Naples.

256
00:18:58,452 --> 00:19:01,038
There's a club...
It's not a club, it's a cellar.

257
00:19:01,122 --> 00:19:04,042
- It's vile.
- Yes, it's vile. You don't have to come.

258
00:19:04,126 --> 00:19:06,754
It's great. It's... It's great.
You're gonna love it.

259
00:19:37,794 --> 00:19:41,090
How are you?

260
00:19:43,259 --> 00:19:45,136
Oh!

261
00:20:23,352 --> 00:20:24,979
That'd be cool.
Bring him up.

262
00:20:29,151 --> 00:20:31,237
Tom Ripley!

263
00:20:33,407 --> 00:20:35,743
Come on!
Get on up here!

264
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:40,583
Yeah!

265
00:20:41,709 --> 00:20:43,753
I'll tell you when
To join the chorus.

266
00:20:43,837 --> 00:20:45,798
Come on.

267
00:20:54,851 --> 00:20:57,187
Okay.
Together!

268
00:21:37,030 --> 00:21:38,574
I bumped into
an old friend from Princeton,

269
00:21:38,657 --> 00:21:41,160
a fellow called Tom Ripley.

270
00:21:41,244 --> 00:21:44,998
He says he's going to haunt me
Until I agree...

271
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:49,421
to go back to New York...

272
00:21:49,504 --> 00:21:51,924
with him.

273
00:21:56,388 --> 00:21:59,016
Afternoon.

274
00:21:59,058 --> 00:22:01,061
What time is it?

275
00:22:01,102 --> 00:22:03,063
- Oh, God.
- "Go back to New York with him. "

276
00:22:04,398 --> 00:22:07,194
- Here...
- You always type your letters?

277
00:22:09,071 --> 00:22:12,534
- That should be two T's.
- I can't write, and I can't spell.

278
00:22:12,617 --> 00:22:15,538
It's the privilege
Of a first-class education.

279
00:22:15,579 --> 00:22:17,665
Your room's
upstairs at the back.

280
00:22:17,749 --> 00:22:20,377
I think Ermalinda
made up the bed. Ermalinda!

281
00:22:23,047 --> 00:22:26,009
- This is so good of you.
- Don't say it again.

282
00:22:29,889 --> 00:22:33,060
Now that you're a double agent
and we're going to string my dad along,

283
00:22:33,102 --> 00:22:35,897
what if we were to buy a car
with your expense money?

284
00:22:35,939 --> 00:22:38,233
- Okay.
- Great.

285
00:22:38,275 --> 00:22:40,403
- Hello, Tom.
- Hello.

286
00:22:40,486 --> 00:22:42,781
Marge, Marge,
what do you think?

287
00:22:42,864 --> 00:22:45,034
Little Ciquencento
with my dad's money?

288
00:22:45,117 --> 00:22:47,954
Oh, please, Dickie.
You can't even drive a car.

289
00:22:48,038 --> 00:22:51,375
- You can't even drive.
- What we need urgently is an icebox.

290
00:22:51,459 --> 00:22:54,170
What do you think? Agree with me,
and I'll be your friend for life.

291
00:22:55,297 --> 00:22:58,885
- I absolutely agree with Marge.
- Hmm.

292
00:22:58,968 --> 00:23:01,388
Icebox. Icebox.

293
00:23:13,654 --> 00:23:15,782
So, what, is he gonna
move in with you?

294
00:23:15,865 --> 00:23:20,538
It'll just be for a little while.
He can be... He makes me laugh.

295
00:23:20,621 --> 00:23:24,126
- Okay, darling.
- Promise you'd say?

296
00:23:24,209 --> 00:23:28,047
- No, I like him.
- Marge, you like everybody.

297
00:23:28,131 --> 00:23:30,843
Don't like you.

298
00:23:30,926 --> 00:23:33,429
Then I'll go to your place
And you can move in with Tom.

299
00:23:42,774 --> 00:23:44,694
I like him.

300
00:23:44,777 --> 00:23:48,448
Marge, you like everybody.

301
00:23:52,704 --> 00:23:55,624
No, I like him.

302
00:23:55,708 --> 00:24:00,547
Marge, you like everybody.

303
00:24:00,631 --> 00:24:04,135
Now you'll find out why Miss
Sherwood always shows up for breakfast.

304
00:24:04,219 --> 00:24:06,847
It's not love.
It's my coffee machine.

305
00:24:06,889 --> 00:24:09,642
Ever since Ermalinda
Showed him how to make his own espresso,

306
00:24:09,726 --> 00:24:11,979
he feels like quite
the grown up.

307
00:24:12,020 --> 00:24:14,816
- I bought the coffee machine.
- Oh, darling, is that for me?

308
00:24:14,899 --> 00:24:17,194
This is for Tom,
because he didn't complain.

309
00:24:17,277 --> 00:24:20,114
That ring is superb.

310
00:24:20,197 --> 00:24:22,659
Oh, Tom, I love you.
See?

311
00:24:22,742 --> 00:24:27,749
Ooh! I had to promise,
capital "P", never to take it off.

312
00:24:27,832 --> 00:24:31,170
- Otherwise, I'd give it to you.
- Isn't it great? I found it in Naples.

313
00:24:31,212 --> 00:24:33,798
I had to bargain for it
for about two weeks.

314
00:24:33,882 --> 00:24:36,301
I hope it wasn't cheap,
Marge.

315
00:24:36,385 --> 00:24:39,305
Oh, it was.

316
00:24:39,389 --> 00:24:42,977
I have to get a birthday present for
Frances, so perhaps you could help me.

317
00:24:43,060 --> 00:24:45,897
- Who's Frances?
- My fiancée.

318
00:24:45,939 --> 00:24:48,776
Engaged?
You're a dark horse, Ripley.

319
00:24:48,859 --> 00:24:50,778
- Who is she?
- Your parents met her.

320
00:24:50,862 --> 00:24:54,742
Oh, God.
Oh, I can just imagine.

321
00:24:54,825 --> 00:24:57,036
"If only Dickie
would settle down.

322
00:24:57,078 --> 00:24:59,164
Doesn't every parent
deserve a grandchild?"

323
00:24:59,248 --> 00:25:02,084
Oh, God.
Never. Never.

324
00:25:02,126 --> 00:25:06,715
I swear on your ring, Marge,
I'm never going back.

325
00:25:06,799 --> 00:25:09,302
- Say when to pull.
- Pull now. Pull.

326
00:25:09,386 --> 00:25:13,224
It's not pulling.
I'm doing it wrong.

327
00:25:15,059 --> 00:25:17,396
- Better now, huh?
- Okay, okay, okay.

328
00:25:17,479 --> 00:25:19,398
We'll make a sailor
Of you yet.

329
00:25:19,482 --> 00:25:21,818
You're doing really well.

330
00:25:21,902 --> 00:25:25,114
- All right. Bar's open.
- Yes, please.

331
00:25:25,197 --> 00:25:28,326
- Hey, can we sail to Venice?
- Sure. I love Venice.

332
00:25:30,454 --> 00:25:33,124
"See Venice and die."
Isn't that right? Or is it Rome?

333
00:25:33,166 --> 00:25:36,253
- Is it Rome?
- I have to see Venice.

334
00:25:36,337 --> 00:25:40,175
You do something and die, don't you?
Okay. Venice is on the list.

335
00:25:40,258 --> 00:25:42,803
And Rome.

336
00:25:42,887 --> 00:25:44,931
Do you ski?

337
00:25:47,184 --> 00:25:49,938
Ah, no, no.
Don't tell me.

338
00:25:50,021 --> 00:25:53,275
You're a lost cause.
That's the next thing to deal with.

339
00:25:53,317 --> 00:25:55,987
Christmas, we're planning
a skiing trip to Cortina.

340
00:25:56,029 --> 00:25:59,450
- Excellent skiing. Excellent. Marge.
- Yes?

341
00:25:59,533 --> 00:26:02,203
Unbelievable.
Tom can't ski either.

342
00:26:02,287 --> 00:26:05,457
- We'll have to teach him that too.
- Thank you.

343
00:26:07,543 --> 00:26:10,756
Such low class, Marge.
Does this guy know anything?

344
00:26:10,839 --> 00:26:13,092
Good thing we're not
getting married soon.

345
00:26:13,176 --> 00:26:15,887
We'd have to invite Tom
on our honeymoon.

346
00:26:19,183 --> 00:26:22,104
Oh, I hated New York.
That whole Park Avenue crowd.

347
00:26:22,187 --> 00:26:24,148
So I fled to Paris
to work on my book.

348
00:26:24,231 --> 00:26:27,319
And I was always going
to this cafe in Montmartre...

349
00:26:27,402 --> 00:26:29,363
with Jean-Jacques.

350
00:26:29,405 --> 00:26:32,993
And Dickie would play
"My Funny Valentine."

351
00:26:33,076 --> 00:26:38,375
It was only later that I found out
he only knows about six songs.

352
00:26:38,458 --> 00:26:40,794
Anyway, I looked forward
to seeing him, I suppose.

353
00:27:07,203 --> 00:27:10,916
Hey, hey, Signor Greenleaf!

354
00:27:10,958 --> 00:27:14,629
You're not at my place by 7:00,
Tom and I are running off together.

355
00:27:14,713 --> 00:27:17,508
- Okay, fine.
- Oh, Dickie!

356
00:27:27,813 --> 00:27:30,358
Oh, hold on.
Hold on.

357
00:27:30,441 --> 00:27:34,697
Silvana, Silvana

358
00:27:34,780 --> 00:27:36,699
<i>You make me smile</i>

359
00:27:36,783 --> 00:27:39,912
I need
to talk to you.

360
00:27:45,961 --> 00:27:49,174
- You're breaking my ribs!
- What?

361
00:27:50,717 --> 00:27:53,554
You're breaking my ribs!

362
00:27:55,348 --> 00:27:58,561
<i>But don't</i>

363
00:27:58,644 --> 00:28:02,274
<i>Change a hair for me</i>

364
00:28:05,069 --> 00:28:07,113
<i>Not if you care</i>

365
00:28:07,197 --> 00:28:09,491
<i>For me</i>

366
00:28:11,661 --> 00:28:16,334
<i>Stay, little Valentine</i>

367
00:28:17,710 --> 00:28:21,173
<i>Stay</i>

368
00:28:25,554 --> 00:28:27,515
<i>Each day</i>

369
00:28:27,598 --> 00:28:34,982
<i>Is Valentine's Day</i>

370
00:28:40,281 --> 00:28:45,246
I could fuck this icebox,
I love it so much.

371
00:28:46,998 --> 00:28:50,544
So, what did you actually
do in New York?

372
00:28:50,628 --> 00:28:53,381
Played piano in a few places.
I told you.

373
00:28:53,465 --> 00:28:56,510
Well, that's one job.
You told me a lot of jobs.

374
00:28:56,594 --> 00:28:59,097
Few places.
That's a few jobs.

375
00:28:59,138 --> 00:29:01,224
The mysterious Mr. Ripley.

376
00:29:01,308 --> 00:29:04,145
Marge and I spend
hours speculating.

377
00:29:04,228 --> 00:29:07,482
Anyway, I don't even want
to think about New York.

378
00:29:07,566 --> 00:29:10,111
Are you ready?

379
00:29:10,153 --> 00:29:14,366
- Cold beer. Thank you, Dad.
- Okay.

380
00:29:14,450 --> 00:29:16,536
Copy out from here.

381
00:29:18,163 --> 00:29:21,500
- You bring this with you to Europe?
- You gonna write something?

382
00:29:21,542 --> 00:29:24,796
I love the fact that you brought
Shakespeare with you but no clothes.

383
00:29:24,838 --> 00:29:28,259
Ermalinda says you wash out the same
shirt every night. Is that true?

384
00:29:28,343 --> 00:29:30,262
No. I have more
than one shirt.

385
00:29:30,345 --> 00:29:32,515
She can do that for you.

386
00:29:32,598 --> 00:29:35,226
Anyway, just wear
some of my stuff.

387
00:29:35,310 --> 00:29:37,730
Wear anything you want.
Most of it's ancient.

388
00:29:39,941 --> 00:29:42,027
Now your signature.

389
00:29:44,864 --> 00:29:47,868
Not Dickie.
Your signature.

390
00:29:58,715 --> 00:30:00,843
Without the glasses,
you're not even ugly.

391
00:30:03,221 --> 00:30:06,224
I don't need them
because I never read.

392
00:30:07,393 --> 00:30:10,104
- How do I look?
- Like Clark Kent.

393
00:30:12,733 --> 00:30:15,945
- Now Superman.
- Superman.

394
00:30:20,576 --> 00:30:23,038
- Okay.
- I know.

395
00:30:23,079 --> 00:30:27,919
It's like a kid's. See this, the "S"
and the "T"? Fine, vulnerable.

396
00:30:28,002 --> 00:30:31,048
That's pain.
That's secret pain.

397
00:30:31,090 --> 00:30:34,010
Well, that must be a very deep secret,
'cause I don't know about it.

398
00:30:34,094 --> 00:30:37,389
Hmm. There's nothing more
naked than your handwriting.

399
00:30:37,431 --> 00:30:40,185
See how nothing's
quite touching the line?

400
00:30:40,268 --> 00:30:43,731
- That's vanity.
- Well, we certainly know that's true.

401
00:30:49,447 --> 00:30:52,409
Do you have any brothers?

402
00:30:52,492 --> 00:30:55,454
No.

403
00:30:55,496 --> 00:30:57,624
No brothers,
no sisters.

404
00:30:59,877 --> 00:31:02,338
Me neither.

405
00:31:02,422 --> 00:31:04,591
Nor does Marge.

406
00:31:06,218 --> 00:31:08,972
All only children.

407
00:31:14,979 --> 00:31:17,107
What does that mean?

408
00:31:19,318 --> 00:31:21,780
Means we've never
shared a bath.

409
00:31:25,743 --> 00:31:28,664
And I'm cold.
Can I get in?

410
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:36,590
No.

411
00:31:39,803 --> 00:31:42,515
I didn't mean
with you in it.

412
00:31:46,353 --> 00:31:49,983
Okay.

413
00:31:50,024 --> 00:31:53,654
Get in. I'm like
a prune anyway.

414
00:32:15,390 --> 00:32:17,476
It is me.
It's an old picture.

415
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:21,565
Every time! "Is it you?
It doesn't look like you."

416
00:32:21,648 --> 00:32:23,526
God!

417
00:32:23,567 --> 00:32:26,404
Letters... Greenleaf and for Ripley.

418
00:32:26,446 --> 00:32:29,408
Ooh. Fran. "I miss you.
When are you coming home?

419
00:32:29,450 --> 00:32:32,036
Stop telling me what
an incredible time you're having.

420
00:32:32,078 --> 00:32:34,206
- How much you love Dickie."
- Whoo!

421
00:32:34,248 --> 00:32:37,377
"And Marge
and Mongibello."

422
00:32:37,460 --> 00:32:39,463
And this one, I think,
is from your father.

423
00:32:43,259 --> 00:32:48,307
- Let me see it. What does he say?
- He's getting impatient.

424
00:32:48,391 --> 00:32:52,813
He wants me to reassure him that you're
going to be home by Thanksgiving.

425
00:32:52,897 --> 00:32:55,733
You've got to get
a new jacket. Really.

426
00:32:55,775 --> 00:32:57,986
You must be sick
Of wearing the same clothes.

427
00:32:58,070 --> 00:33:01,032
I can't. I can't keep spending
your father's money.

428
00:33:01,115 --> 00:33:04,036
I love how
responsible you are.

429
00:33:04,119 --> 00:33:07,248
My dad should make you
Chief accountant or something.

430
00:33:07,290 --> 00:33:10,294
Or when I take over,
which is never, I will.

431
00:33:10,336 --> 00:33:14,049
Okay. When you take over,
which is never, I'll accept.

432
00:33:14,132 --> 00:33:16,260
Let me buy you a jacket. When we
get to Rome, there's a great place...

433
00:33:16,343 --> 00:33:19,973
- Battistoni.
- Battistoni.

434
00:33:23,811 --> 00:33:26,982
Roma, we're taking Tom
to Roma

435
00:33:27,024 --> 00:33:30,445
We're going to a-Roma

436
00:33:38,205 --> 00:33:41,000
Buon giorno.
Nice sweater.

437
00:33:41,083 --> 00:33:43,128
Where do we get
a carrozza for the Forum?

438
00:33:43,211 --> 00:33:45,464
- Can we just hire any of them?
- Relax.

439
00:33:45,506 --> 00:33:48,176
Relax!

440
00:33:48,259 --> 00:33:51,054
It's just there's so much
to do in a single day.

441
00:33:51,138 --> 00:33:55,101
The most important question is where to
eat. I hope Freddie made a reservation.

442
00:33:55,185 --> 00:33:57,104
Freddie?

443
00:33:57,187 --> 00:34:00,483
Freddie.
Freddie Miles.

444
00:34:00,525 --> 00:34:02,861
Freddie's organizing
the Cortina skiing trip.

445
00:34:02,945 --> 00:34:04,697
Oh.

446
00:34:04,739 --> 00:34:07,325
Oh, here he is.

447
00:34:10,746 --> 00:34:12,957
- Frederico!
- Comestai?

448
00:34:18,423 --> 00:34:21,969
Oh, God, don't you want to fuck
every woman you see just once?

449
00:34:22,052 --> 00:34:25,223
- Only once?
- Absolutely. Once. Ciao.

450
00:34:25,307 --> 00:34:27,226
- Tom Ripley, Freddie Miles.
- Tom.

451
00:34:27,309 --> 00:34:32,441
I mean, hey, if I'm late,
think what her husband's saying.

452
00:34:32,524 --> 00:34:35,194
- You look gorgeous.
- As always.

453
00:34:36,321 --> 00:34:38,240
So, mangiare.

454
00:34:38,323 --> 00:34:40,660
Si. I got us a table
outside at Fabrizio's. Tommy.

455
00:34:40,743 --> 00:34:42,704
Outstanding. I tell you,

456
00:34:42,746 --> 00:34:45,583
- I'm so cabin-crazy with Mongi.
- I know. I was there.

457
00:35:01,103 --> 00:35:04,232
Look, Tom, we got to go to a club
And meet some friends of Freddie's.

458
00:35:04,315 --> 00:35:07,694
The best thing is, if you want
to be a tourist, grab a cab now,

459
00:35:07,778 --> 00:35:10,448
and I'll meet you
at the railway station.

460
00:35:10,531 --> 00:35:12,450
What club?

461
00:35:14,119 --> 00:35:17,624
Freddie's arranged it
with some of the skiing crowd.

462
00:35:19,126 --> 00:35:21,379
Come if you want, but I thought
you wanted to go sightseeing.

463
00:35:21,462 --> 00:35:24,424
I do, and then maybe get the jacket
and what have you.

464
00:35:24,508 --> 00:35:26,802
Dick!
You gotta hear this.

465
00:35:28,012 --> 00:35:30,891
Listen, just take
one of mine when we get back.

466
00:35:30,974 --> 00:35:33,603
Don't worry about it.

467
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:37,399
Come on!

468
00:35:47,537 --> 00:35:49,999
Ciao.
Have fun, okay?

469
00:36:02,682 --> 00:36:06,144
You said to make sure you didn't
miss the train. Leaves at 8:00.

470
00:36:08,189 --> 00:36:10,275
Have a good time.

471
00:36:10,358 --> 00:36:12,069
See ya, Tommy.

472
00:36:56,876 --> 00:37:01,507
If I meant
anything to her

473
00:37:01,590 --> 00:37:06,639
I'd be brave, and here's
The song I'd bring to her

474
00:37:06,764 --> 00:37:09,475
I'd sing to her

475
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:13,689
May I be the only one

476
00:37:13,773 --> 00:37:16,234
To say I

477
00:37:16,318 --> 00:37:20,615
Really fell in love
the day I

478
00:37:20,657 --> 00:37:23,994
First set eyes on you

479
00:37:26,414 --> 00:37:29,835
- May I
- What are you doing?

480
00:37:29,877 --> 00:37:32,588
Oh. I was just
amusing myself.

481
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:38,179
- Sorry.
- I wish you'd get out of my clothes.

482
00:37:38,262 --> 00:37:42,852
- Do you have my shoes on too?
- You said I could pick out a jacket...

483
00:37:45,897 --> 00:37:47,858
Did you get undressed
in your own room?

484
00:37:50,737 --> 00:37:53,031
Thought you missed
the train.

485
00:37:53,073 --> 00:37:55,660
Freddie drove me back
in his car.

486
00:37:55,743 --> 00:37:58,747
- Is Freddie here?
- He's downstairs.

487
00:37:58,830 --> 00:38:02,001
I was just fooling around.

488
00:38:02,043 --> 00:38:06,048
Don't say anything.
I was just fooling around.

489
00:38:07,759 --> 00:38:09,719
Sorry.

490
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:14,100
God. A corduroy jacket in Italy.

491
00:38:14,183 --> 00:38:16,103
- Good morning, Tom.
- Morning.

492
00:38:16,186 --> 00:38:18,898
Come join us.

493
00:38:20,817 --> 00:38:24,822
Hey. I want this job
of yours, Tommy.

494
00:38:24,906 --> 00:38:27,826
I was just saying,
you live in Italy,

495
00:38:27,909 --> 00:38:31,456
you stay at Dickie's house,
you eat Dickie's food,

496
00:38:31,539 --> 00:38:36,420
you wear his clothes,
and his father picks up the tab.

497
00:38:36,462 --> 00:38:39,925
If you get bored,

498
00:38:40,008 --> 00:38:43,513
you let me know,
'cause I'll do it.

499
00:38:43,596 --> 00:38:46,433
- I'll do it.
- To the mainland!

500
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:53,734
You really should go in.
It's marvellous.

501
00:38:53,776 --> 00:38:56,905
I'm fine.

502
00:39:06,459 --> 00:39:08,461
Are you okay?

503
00:39:09,546 --> 00:39:11,632
Sure.

504
00:39:15,804 --> 00:39:18,516
The thing with Dickie...

505
00:39:18,599 --> 00:39:23,606
It's like the sun shines
on you, and it's glorious.

506
00:39:25,108 --> 00:39:28,654
And then he forgets you
and it's very, very cold.

507
00:39:28,737 --> 00:39:30,657
So I'm learning.

508
00:39:30,740 --> 00:39:34,244
When you have his attention, you feel
you're the only person in the world.

509
00:39:34,328 --> 00:39:37,040
That's why
everybody loves him.

510
00:39:37,123 --> 00:39:40,836
It's always the same. Whenever
someone new comes into his life...

511
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:43,465
Freddie, Fausto,
Peter Smith-Kingsley.

512
00:39:43,548 --> 00:39:45,884
He's wonderful.
Have you met him?

513
00:39:48,388 --> 00:39:50,849
Especially you.

514
00:39:55,355 --> 00:39:58,150
And that's just the boys.

515
00:40:05,326 --> 00:40:08,580
Come get him!
Come get him!

516
00:40:08,664 --> 00:40:10,583
Tell me, why is it
that when men play,

517
00:40:10,666 --> 00:40:13,211
they always play
at killing each other?

518
00:40:13,295 --> 00:40:16,424
He's drowning me!
He's drowning me!

519
00:40:18,384 --> 00:40:22,264
- I'm sorry about Cortina, by the way.
- What about Cortina?

520
00:40:24,726 --> 00:40:27,605
Didn't...
Didn't... Didn't Dick say?

521
00:40:29,315 --> 00:40:32,235
He spoke to Freddie,
and... and apparently...

522
00:40:32,319 --> 00:40:34,238
it's not going
to work out.

523
00:40:36,032 --> 00:40:38,452
It's because
everyone else can ski,

524
00:40:38,535 --> 00:40:40,788
and it affects
where you stay, and...

525
00:40:48,256 --> 00:40:50,718
Come on, Freddie.

526
00:40:50,801 --> 00:40:53,388
At least stick around for
the Festival of the Madonna.

527
00:40:53,471 --> 00:40:56,058
- The whole town comes out...
- I don't think so.

528
00:40:56,141 --> 00:41:00,814
I have my own, uh, Madonna backin Rome.
Why don't you come back with me?

529
00:41:00,897 --> 00:41:03,400
A lot of ladies.
Ooh.

530
00:41:09,074 --> 00:41:11,244
- Oh, God.
- You want to take over?

531
00:41:11,327 --> 00:41:13,288
Yeah, sure.

532
00:41:13,330 --> 00:41:16,292
Just point her at Capri.
Avoid the rocks.

533
00:41:16,334 --> 00:41:18,795
Where are you going?

534
00:41:18,879 --> 00:41:20,881
Marge maintenance.

535
00:41:20,965 --> 00:41:22,884
Aye-aye.

536
00:41:44,036 --> 00:41:45,997
Don't.

537
00:41:59,597 --> 00:42:01,642
Dickie...

538
00:42:03,728 --> 00:42:07,524
Tommy.
How's the peeping?

539
00:42:08,651 --> 00:42:12,823
Tommy,
how's the peeping?

540
00:42:14,784 --> 00:42:16,953
Tommy, Tommy,
Tommy, Tommy, Tommy.

541
00:44:09,013 --> 00:44:10,974
Is someone getting
an ambulance?

542
00:44:15,814 --> 00:44:19,235
Is someone getting an ambulance?

543
00:44:47,813 --> 00:44:50,692
What's the fight about?
That's her fiancé, isn't it?

544
00:44:50,775 --> 00:44:55,657
- I don't know. Why are you asking me?
- Are they blaming him?

545
00:44:55,698 --> 00:44:59,370
How can it take an hour
to find an ambulance?

546
00:44:59,453 --> 00:45:01,956
She was already dead, darling,
wasn't she? So I suppose...

547
00:45:02,040 --> 00:45:06,546
I don't know why people say
this country is civilized.

548
00:45:06,629 --> 00:45:09,758
- Dickie!
- It isn't. It's fucking primitive.

549
00:45:11,385 --> 00:45:13,805
I'll go see
what's the matter.

550
00:45:13,847 --> 00:45:15,807
I'll go.

551
00:45:32,370 --> 00:45:34,373
I know why you're upset.

552
00:45:37,043 --> 00:45:39,588
I know about
Silvana, Dickie.

553
00:45:42,300 --> 00:45:44,427
I know about
you and Silvana.

554
00:45:44,511 --> 00:45:47,014
What about us?

555
00:45:50,143 --> 00:45:53,689
You don't have
to clean up! Really!

556
00:46:01,408 --> 00:46:04,161
- Like what?
- Forget it.

557
00:46:06,289 --> 00:46:08,750
She was pregnant.
Did you know that?

558
00:46:13,298 --> 00:46:16,385
Silvana was pregnant.

559
00:46:17,678 --> 00:46:20,265
Do you know what that means
in a place like this?

560
00:46:20,348 --> 00:46:23,269
I'm prepared
to take the blame.

561
00:46:23,352 --> 00:46:27,274
- What are you talking about?
- You've been so good to me.

562
00:46:27,316 --> 00:46:32,072
You're the brother I never had.
I'm the brother you never had.

563
00:46:32,114 --> 00:46:34,867
I would do anything
For you, Dickie.

564
00:46:37,162 --> 00:46:39,248
She came to me for help.

565
00:46:39,331 --> 00:46:41,459
She needed money.

566
00:46:44,463 --> 00:46:48,927
I didn't help her.
I didn't help her.

567
00:46:48,969 --> 00:46:53,307
Now she's drowned herself.
And it's my fault.

568
00:47:00,650 --> 00:47:02,569
I'm not going
to say anything...

569
00:47:02,653 --> 00:47:05,782
to Marge, to the police
or anybody.

570
00:47:05,823 --> 00:47:08,869
It's a secret
between us, Dickie.

571
00:47:11,038 --> 00:47:12,999
And I'll keep it.

572
00:47:14,543 --> 00:47:17,088
"Dear Tom.
In view of the fact Dickie shows...

573
00:47:17,171 --> 00:47:21,969
no more signs of coming home than
before you went..." blah, blah, blah...

574
00:47:24,848 --> 00:47:27,476
"I hope that the trip has
afforded you some pleasure...

575
00:47:27,560 --> 00:47:30,772
despite the failure
of its main objective.

576
00:47:30,856 --> 00:47:35,320
You no longer should consider yourself
obligated to us in any way."

577
00:47:35,403 --> 00:47:37,406
Can't blame him.

578
00:47:37,489 --> 00:47:39,575
You could hardly expect this
To go on forever, Tom.

579
00:47:39,659 --> 00:47:42,162
Well, you can write again.

580
00:47:42,203 --> 00:47:45,124
- Especially now we're brothers.
- I can't.

581
00:47:45,207 --> 00:47:47,335
How can I,
in all decency.

582
00:47:47,377 --> 00:47:50,130
You said it yourself.
It's my dad's money you're spending.

583
00:47:50,214 --> 00:47:54,344
We've had a great run
though, haven't we?

584
00:47:54,386 --> 00:47:58,349
Well, we'll still go to Venice.
We could stick to that plan.

585
00:47:58,391 --> 00:48:00,477
I don't think so, Tom.

586
00:48:00,560 --> 00:48:03,147
You can't pay
Your own way, can you?

587
00:48:03,230 --> 00:48:07,611
It's time we all moved on.

588
00:48:07,694 --> 00:48:11,908
I'm sick of Mongi.
Especially now, with everything...

589
00:48:11,992 --> 00:48:13,952
I really want to move
to the north.

590
00:48:14,036 --> 00:48:16,539
I need to check out
San Remo next week.

591
00:48:16,623 --> 00:48:18,667
Find somewhere new
to keep the boat.

592
00:48:18,750 --> 00:48:22,130
It would be great, though,
if you came with me to San Remo.

593
00:48:22,213 --> 00:48:25,718
There's a great jazz festival.
We could say good-bye in style.

594
00:48:25,759 --> 00:48:28,346
What do you think?

595
00:48:28,429 --> 00:48:31,183
Our last trip!

596
00:48:36,773 --> 00:48:38,693
Sure.

597
00:49:33,012 --> 00:49:35,307
Why do you do
that thing with your neck?

598
00:49:35,349 --> 00:49:37,309
What thing?

599
00:49:39,479 --> 00:49:42,858
On trains, you always
do that thing.

600
00:49:46,905 --> 00:49:49,784
Spooky.

601
00:49:49,867 --> 00:49:53,705
Spook... k... k...
k... k... k... k...

602
00:49:57,752 --> 00:49:59,713
Spooky.

603
00:50:20,740 --> 00:50:22,701
Oh!

604
00:50:22,743 --> 00:50:26,539
Didn't I tell you
San Remo was crazy?

605
00:50:26,581 --> 00:50:29,418
This is more like it!
Come on!

606
00:50:39,264 --> 00:50:41,767
Grazie.

607
00:50:41,850 --> 00:50:45,021
To Mongibello
and the happiest days of my life.

608
00:50:45,105 --> 00:50:47,691
To Mongi.
You're cheerful tonight.

609
00:50:47,775 --> 00:50:50,194
I'm suddenly quite happy
to be going back.

610
00:50:50,278 --> 00:50:53,031
Did I know you
at Princeton, Tom?

611
00:50:53,115 --> 00:50:55,785
I don't think I did,
did I?

612
00:50:55,868 --> 00:50:59,039
- Why are you asking all of a sudden?
- No reason.

613
00:50:59,123 --> 00:51:02,669
Because you're leaving, I guess.
I don't think you were there.

614
00:51:03,795 --> 00:51:06,924
- Why?
- I mean it as a compliment.

615
00:51:07,008 --> 00:51:08,969
You've got
such great taste.

616
00:51:09,010 --> 00:51:13,182
Most of the thugs at Princeton
had tasted everything and had no taste.

617
00:51:13,266 --> 00:51:18,272
I used to say,
"the cream of America: rich and thick."

618
00:51:18,356 --> 00:51:20,442
Freddie's
the perfect example.

619
00:51:20,525 --> 00:51:23,112
Then I'll take it
as a compliment.

620
00:51:23,195 --> 00:51:25,156
I knew it!
I knew it.

621
00:51:25,239 --> 00:51:28,118
Marge and I had a bet.

622
00:51:36,462 --> 00:51:38,340
Do you even like jazz,

623
00:51:38,423 --> 00:51:40,676
or was that
for my benefit?

624
00:51:40,801 --> 00:51:43,471
- I've gotten to like it.
- Oh, yes!

625
00:51:45,140 --> 00:51:48,060
I've gotten to like everything
about the way you live.

626
00:51:48,102 --> 00:51:50,355
It's one big love affair.

627
00:51:52,483 --> 00:51:54,610
If you knew my life
back home in New York...

628
00:51:54,694 --> 00:51:56,780
I'm thinkin'
of givin' up the sax.

629
00:51:56,863 --> 00:51:58,991
What do you think
about the drums?

630
00:51:59,074 --> 00:52:02,287
- What?
- So cool.

631
00:52:02,370 --> 00:52:05,291
I'm gonna rent a boat tomorrow,
take a look around.

632
00:52:06,334 --> 00:52:08,920
This is how I found
my place in Mongi.

633
00:52:08,962 --> 00:52:12,008
Took a boat out...

634
00:52:12,091 --> 00:52:14,094
around the bay,

635
00:52:14,135 --> 00:52:16,722
first thing I liked,

636
00:52:16,806 --> 00:52:18,725
I got it.

637
00:52:20,101 --> 00:52:24,357
- Whoa!
- Come on, Dickie. Don't go crazy.

638
00:52:24,440 --> 00:52:26,944
- Dickie. Slow down!
- Hold on.

639
00:52:26,985 --> 00:52:28,988
Wait a minute!
It's gonna tip! Oh, God!

640
00:52:29,071 --> 00:52:32,617
Stop it! Somebody!
Somebody! Stop it!

641
00:52:36,164 --> 00:52:38,291
Oh, I love it here!

642
00:52:38,375 --> 00:52:40,920
I love it here!
I'm gonna move here!

643
00:52:41,003 --> 00:52:43,590
Beautiful.

644
00:52:48,012 --> 00:52:51,100
I want to tell you
my plan.

645
00:52:51,183 --> 00:52:54,062
- So tell me.
- Well, I thought...

646
00:52:54,145 --> 00:52:57,024
I'd come back in the new year
under my own steam.

647
00:52:57,107 --> 00:53:00,278
- Really? To Italy?
- Of course.

648
00:53:00,361 --> 00:53:03,824
And I figured,
just for argument's sake,

649
00:53:03,908 --> 00:53:05,952
say I got a place.

650
00:53:06,035 --> 00:53:08,497
Or say we split
the rent on a house,

651
00:53:08,539 --> 00:53:10,791
I could get a job,
or, better still,

652
00:53:10,875 --> 00:53:12,711
if I got a place in Rome,
and then when we're there,

653
00:53:12,794 --> 00:53:15,589
we could be there, and when we're here,
we could be here.

654
00:53:15,673 --> 00:53:20,220
- I don't think so.
- Particularly with the Marge problem.

655
00:53:20,304 --> 00:53:22,348
You just blame me.

656
00:53:23,600 --> 00:53:28,064
- Marge and I are getting married.
- How?

657
00:53:28,105 --> 00:53:32,069
- How?
- Yesterday, you were ogling girls.

658
00:53:32,152 --> 00:53:34,071
Today you're getting married?
That's absurd.

659
00:53:36,157 --> 00:53:40,121
- I love Marge.
- You love me. You're not marrying me.

660
00:53:40,204 --> 00:53:42,958
- Tom, I don't love you.
- No, I don't mean that as a threat.

661
00:53:43,041 --> 00:53:46,128
To be honest, I'm-I'm a little
relieved you're going.

662
00:53:46,212 --> 00:53:48,965
I think we've seen enough
Of each other for a while.

663
00:53:53,805 --> 00:53:56,725
- What?
- You can be a leech!

664
00:53:56,767 --> 00:53:58,728
You know that!

665
00:54:00,772 --> 00:54:03,901
And... it's boring.

666
00:54:06,530 --> 00:54:09,533
You can be quite boring.

667
00:54:21,507 --> 00:54:23,760
The funny thing is,
I'm not pretending...

668
00:54:23,802 --> 00:54:26,305
to be somebody else,
and you are.

669
00:54:26,347 --> 00:54:29,517
- Boring.
- I've been absolutely honest with you...

670
00:54:29,601 --> 00:54:31,520
about my feelings.

671
00:54:31,603 --> 00:54:34,273
- Boring.
- But you... First of all,

672
00:54:34,315 --> 00:54:36,276
I know there's something.

673
00:54:36,318 --> 00:54:39,322
That evening, when we played chess,
for instance, it was obvious.

674
00:54:39,363 --> 00:54:42,826
- What evening?
- It's too dangerous for you to take on.

675
00:54:42,868 --> 00:54:44,954
Oh, no, no.
We're brothers.

676
00:54:44,996 --> 00:54:49,710
Hey. And then you do this sordid thing
with Marge... fucking her...

677
00:54:49,793 --> 00:54:51,629
on the boat, while we
all have to listen,

678
00:54:51,671 --> 00:54:53,673
which was
excruciating.

679
00:54:53,715 --> 00:54:56,886
And you follow your cock around like a...
And now you're getting married.

680
00:54:56,969 --> 00:54:59,306
No, I'm bewildered.
Forgive me.

681
00:54:59,347 --> 00:55:01,809
You're lying to Marge and then
you're getting married to her.

682
00:55:01,851 --> 00:55:06,189
You're knocking up Sylvana, ruining
everybody... You want to play the sax.

683
00:55:06,273 --> 00:55:08,693
You want to play the drums. Which is it,
Dickie? What are you actually...

684
00:55:10,612 --> 00:55:14,367
Who are you? Huh?
Some third-class mooch? Who are you?

685
00:55:14,450 --> 00:55:16,411
Who are you to say
anything to me?

686
00:55:16,494 --> 00:55:19,039
Who are you
to tell me anything?

687
00:55:19,123 --> 00:55:22,210
Actually, I really, really do
not want to be on this boat with you.

688
00:55:22,293 --> 00:55:24,713
- I can't move without you moving.
- Shut up. Shut up.

689
00:55:24,797 --> 00:55:28,218
It gives me the creeps.
You give me the creeps.

690
00:55:28,301 --> 00:55:30,262
- You shut up.
- I can't move without "Dickie, Dickie,"

691
00:55:30,345 --> 00:55:32,390
Ike a little girl
all the time.

692
00:55:32,473 --> 00:55:34,267
Shut up!

693
00:55:35,852 --> 00:55:38,564
Oh, God, Dickie.

694
00:55:38,648 --> 00:55:41,401
- God's sake.
- Oh... Oh God!

695
00:55:43,571 --> 00:55:46,032
Okay. Okay.

696
00:55:46,116 --> 00:55:48,243
We have to get you... Okay...

697
00:55:50,329 --> 00:55:52,999
I'm gonna kill you!
Kill you!

698
00:55:56,087 --> 00:55:58,423
You're dead!

699
00:56:05,307 --> 00:56:08,102
Stop! Stop!
Please! Please!

700
00:56:08,186 --> 00:56:12,232
Stop it! Stop!

701
00:56:14,277 --> 00:56:16,238
- Dickie, let go!
- I'll kill you!

702
00:56:21,953 --> 00:56:25,625
Stop! Stop!
Stop!

703
00:56:25,708 --> 00:56:28,503
Stop! Stop!
Stop!

704
00:58:31,912 --> 00:58:34,290
Hi. Can I have
my key, please?

705
00:58:34,373 --> 00:58:36,334
Of course.

706
00:58:36,417 --> 00:58:39,880
You must be very cold.
Uh, Signor Greenleaf, yes?

707
00:58:39,964 --> 00:58:41,883
No. I'm...

708
00:59:51,639 --> 00:59:55,143
Hello, Marge.

709
00:59:55,227 --> 00:59:57,855
Tom!

710
00:59:57,897 --> 00:59:59,983
You startled me!

711
01:00:00,066 --> 01:00:03,237
- Sorry. How are you?
- You're back!

712
01:00:03,320 --> 01:00:05,782
- Your book going well?
- Yes.

713
01:00:05,865 --> 01:00:08,869
I'm on a good streak,
Thank you.

714
01:00:08,953 --> 01:00:12,541
I was just...
looking at you. So quiet.

715
01:00:12,624 --> 01:00:15,586
Where's Dickie?

716
01:00:18,882 --> 01:00:21,886
I think he's planning on staying
in Rome for a few days.

717
01:00:21,969 --> 01:00:25,724
Rome? Ahh.
Did he say why?

718
01:00:25,808 --> 01:00:28,811
I don't understand Dickie.
Your guess is as good as mine.

719
01:00:28,895 --> 01:00:30,856
What does that mean?

720
01:00:30,939 --> 01:00:35,445
Oh, one day I'm invited skiing,
the next day I'm not.

721
01:00:37,614 --> 01:00:41,912
One day, we're one family,
then the next day he wants to be alone.

722
01:00:41,953 --> 01:00:43,914
You tell me.

723
01:00:43,956 --> 01:00:46,542
Is that what he said?
He wants to be alone?

724
01:00:46,626 --> 01:00:51,048
He was thinking of you.
He asked me to deliver this.

725
01:00:51,132 --> 01:00:54,469
Thank you.

726
01:00:54,553 --> 01:00:56,597
He knows
I love this.

727
01:00:58,391 --> 01:01:01,437
- But why it couldn't have waited. I...
- Errand number one:

728
01:01:01,120 --> 01:01:03,664
deliver Marge's perfume.

729
01:01:03,747 --> 01:01:06,292
Errand number two:

730
01:01:06,376 --> 01:01:09,545
pack some clothes
and his precious saxophone.

731
01:01:11,214 --> 01:01:13,174
How long is he staying for?

732
01:01:13,258 --> 01:01:16,678
Search me.
I guess we're abandoned.

733
01:01:43,039 --> 01:01:45,416
Goddamn it!

734
01:01:46,793 --> 01:01:48,711
Are you okay?

735
01:01:59,264 --> 01:02:02,600
There was a letter from Dickie
in with my perfume.

736
01:02:04,686 --> 01:02:08,357
You realize it's more
than just a few days.

737
01:02:08,439 --> 01:02:12,443
He's thinking of moving to Rome.

738
01:02:12,485 --> 01:02:14,905
The thing is,

739
01:02:14,988 --> 01:02:17,657
the night before
he left, we...

740
01:02:17,740 --> 01:02:19,827
we talked about
moving together...

741
01:02:21,536 --> 01:02:23,621
somewhere north,
and I suppose I...

742
01:02:26,250 --> 01:02:29,502
put some pressure on him
about getting married.

743
01:02:31,505 --> 01:02:33,673
I just...

744
01:02:35,677 --> 01:02:37,970
I just might have scared him off.

745
01:02:43,642 --> 01:02:46,312
There's a side to him...

746
01:02:46,354 --> 01:02:49,690
when our heads
are on the pillow...

747
01:02:49,773 --> 01:02:53,152
I know no one else sees
that's so tender.

748
01:02:55,196 --> 01:02:58,492
I think I should come with you
to Rome and confront him.

749
01:03:04,831 --> 01:03:07,710
He hates
being confronted.

750
01:03:09,503 --> 01:03:11,713
I think you're right.

751
01:03:20,681 --> 01:03:22,807
Grazie.
Checking in.

752
01:03:31,233 --> 01:03:33,193
Checking in.

753
01:03:33,234 --> 01:03:37,365
- Signor Ripley?
- It's me.

754
01:03:39,534 --> 01:03:42,661
Signor Greenleaf.

755
01:03:42,703 --> 01:03:45,206
Of course.
Welcome back.

756
01:03:45,290 --> 01:03:47,667
Thank you.

757
01:04:05,142 --> 01:04:07,061
Pronto?

758
01:04:07,145 --> 01:04:10,523
Yes, I'd like to telephone
the Hotel Goldoni.

759
01:04:10,565 --> 01:04:15,195
- Si, signor.
- I want to speak to Thomas Ripley.

760
01:04:15,237 --> 01:04:18,199
- Ripley? Subito.
- Yes. Grazie.

761
01:04:26,164 --> 01:04:31,170
Pronto.

762
01:04:31,253 --> 01:04:33,172
Signor Greenleaf,
Signor Ripley's not there.

763
01:04:33,256 --> 01:04:35,382
- He's not there?
- No, signor.

764
01:04:35,424 --> 01:04:38,177
Well, I would like
to leave a message.

765
01:04:38,260 --> 01:04:40,513
- He's not there? I'll leave a message.
- No, signor.

766
01:04:40,596 --> 01:04:42,723
- Got your call.
- Got your call.

767
01:04:42,765 --> 01:04:44,726
- Dinner tonight...
- Dinner tonight...

768
01:04:44,768 --> 01:04:46,727
- sounds fine.
- sounds fine.

769
01:04:46,769 --> 01:04:50,274
- Ripley. Ripley.
- Ripley.

770
01:04:50,357 --> 01:04:53,860
- Dickie Greenleaf.
- Dickie Greenleaf.

771
01:04:53,943 --> 01:04:56,905
- Yes. Greenleaf.
- Greenleaf.

772
01:04:56,989 --> 01:04:59,115
At the Grand.

773
01:04:59,199 --> 01:05:02,619
And I'd like to have
this wallet embossed.

774
01:05:02,702 --> 01:05:04,620
I don't know
the word in Italian.

775
01:05:04,704 --> 01:05:06,706
Embossed. Of course,
Signor Greenleaf.

776
01:05:06,790 --> 01:05:08,791
Thank you.

777
01:05:12,504 --> 01:05:16,217
Dickie!
It's...

778
01:05:19,303 --> 01:05:21,222
- Oh, my gosh.
- Meredith.

779
01:05:21,305 --> 01:05:23,224
- Ciao!
- Ciao. Come in. Come in.

780
01:05:23,307 --> 01:05:25,934
But you're going skiing
with those Yankees, aren't you?

781
01:05:26,018 --> 01:05:30,689
- What?
- At Christmas. To Cortina.

782
01:05:30,773 --> 01:05:32,734
- With Freddie Miles.
- How did you know that?

783
01:05:32,817 --> 01:05:36,820
Oh! Everybody
knows Freddie Miles.

784
01:05:39,532 --> 01:05:41,534
Is Freddie in Rome?

785
01:05:41,617 --> 01:05:43,536
- Now?
- Yeah.

786
01:05:43,620 --> 01:05:45,955
Oh, I don't think so.

787
01:05:46,038 --> 01:05:50,460
But I... But I've met him,
Of course, and we've chatted.

788
01:05:50,501 --> 01:05:54,131
And I know about you...

789
01:05:54,215 --> 01:05:56,799
and Marge in Mongi.

790
01:05:56,883 --> 01:06:00,095
What an unreliable
rat you are.

791
01:06:00,179 --> 01:06:02,430
Well, Freddie said
you were a rat.

792
01:06:02,514 --> 01:06:04,809
And I thought
to myself,

793
01:06:04,850 --> 01:06:07,978
"Ah, now I know why
he travels under 'R.'"

794
01:06:08,061 --> 01:06:10,397
I've left Marge,
Meredith.

795
01:06:10,480 --> 01:06:12,691
And Mongi.

796
01:06:12,774 --> 01:06:16,028
- So the rat's here in Rome.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

797
01:06:16,112 --> 01:06:19,240
Oh, don't be sorry, no.
I've never been happier.

798
01:06:19,323 --> 01:06:22,618
I... I feel like
I've been handed a new life.

799
01:06:22,701 --> 01:06:26,580
The truth is that if you've had money
your entire life,

800
01:06:26,664 --> 01:06:29,959
either you despise it,
which we do... agreed?

801
01:06:30,042 --> 01:06:33,004
You're only truly comfortable
around other people...

802
01:06:33,046 --> 01:06:36,131
who have it
and despise it.

803
01:06:36,215 --> 01:06:38,134
I know.

804
01:06:39,636 --> 01:06:42,263
I've never admitted that
to anyone.

805
01:06:47,811 --> 01:06:51,064
Because my friend
Mr. Greenleaf, Signor Greenleaf and I,

806
01:06:51,148 --> 01:06:53,067
are on a little spending spree.

807
01:06:53,150 --> 01:06:57,112
- I see.
- We're behaving very badly.

808
01:06:57,195 --> 01:07:01,658
Oh, I love Italian money. So dark.
Doesn't make you feel guilty.

809
01:07:01,742 --> 01:07:03,661
- Gr-r-razie.
- Thank you.

810
01:07:14,255 --> 01:07:17,758
I don't want too many large bills.
No one will change them.

811
01:07:17,842 --> 01:07:19,928
Tutto bene,
Signor Greenleaf.

812
01:07:35,777 --> 01:07:39,405
- I really like this too.
- I think I'm having that too.

813
01:07:45,787 --> 01:07:48,248
Tomorrow.

814
01:07:53,086 --> 01:07:55,547
- Arrivederci.
- Arrivederci. Oops!

815
01:07:56,799 --> 01:07:58,717
- Ciao.
- Ciao.

816
01:08:04,223 --> 01:08:08,645
I know you're a jazz fiend,
but do you absolutely hate the opera?

817
01:08:11,855 --> 01:08:14,776
I've...
I've...

818
01:08:14,817 --> 01:08:18,446
been trying to give
my tickets away.

819
01:08:18,529 --> 01:08:22,991
It's tomorrow. But if
you were prepared to be dragged...

820
01:08:24,494 --> 01:08:26,663
You could drag me.

821
01:10:14,940 --> 01:10:18,653
Feodor Chaliapin.
It's the whole Russian baritone.

822
01:10:18,737 --> 01:10:22,115
Thank you so much
for inviting me tonight.

823
01:10:22,199 --> 01:10:26,035
Can you bear it?
We hear you are a friend of Freddie's.

824
01:10:26,118 --> 01:10:29,289
He has "I hate opera"
tattooed on his chest.

825
01:10:29,372 --> 01:10:31,875
There's room for a whole
libretto on Freddie's chest.

826
01:10:33,961 --> 01:10:36,296
I'm sure
we've met before.

827
01:10:36,379 --> 01:10:39,300
I was sure we'd met before.
Weren't you, Ted?

828
01:10:39,383 --> 01:10:41,427
Dick is Herbert
Greenleaf's boy.

829
01:10:41,468 --> 01:10:44,054
- I know.
- Yes, I think we have.

830
01:10:44,137 --> 01:10:48,225
One minute you people are children,
and the next you're getting tattooed.

831
01:10:50,186 --> 01:10:52,771
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

832
01:10:54,857 --> 01:10:56,817
Cheers.

833
01:11:01,114 --> 01:11:03,532
- Excuse me.
- Prego.

834
01:11:03,616 --> 01:11:05,952
Oh!
Excuse me.

835
01:11:06,036 --> 01:11:08,287
- Hello.
- Hello.

836
01:11:09,789 --> 01:11:11,707
- Tom!
- Marge!

837
01:11:11,791 --> 01:11:14,919
How are you?
What are you doing in Rome?

838
01:11:15,002 --> 01:11:18,631
- Is he here? Are you with Dickie?
- No. Um, no.

839
01:11:18,714 --> 01:11:21,802
Um, hello.
Um, I'm Tom Ripley.

840
01:11:21,843 --> 01:11:24,262
Peter Smith-Kingsley. I've heard
all about you from Marge and Dickie.

841
01:11:24,346 --> 01:11:27,308
- Ditto.
- No... No glasses.

842
01:11:27,350 --> 01:11:30,184
So, where are you hiding him?
He's impossible, isn't he?

843
01:11:30,268 --> 01:11:32,396
Is he really not here?

844
01:11:32,479 --> 01:11:36,149
Marge, you know Dickie has
"I hate opera" tattooed on his chest.

845
01:11:36,191 --> 01:11:39,236
- I thought you were going to Venice.
- Yes, what happened with that?

846
01:11:39,319 --> 01:11:41,237
I heard you were
desperate to come.

847
01:11:41,321 --> 01:11:43,324
I was rather looking forward
to rowing you around.

848
01:11:43,365 --> 01:11:47,077
I am. I really am.

849
01:11:47,161 --> 01:11:50,372
I've been traveling, and I just can't
seem to get that far north.

850
01:11:50,455 --> 01:11:52,333
Well, you should hurry,
before we sink.

851
01:11:52,375 --> 01:11:55,503
Look, let me give you
the telephone number.

852
01:11:55,544 --> 01:11:58,423
There. Oh, look.
There's Meredith.

853
01:11:58,506 --> 01:12:01,759
Meredith. What's her name,
Marge? The textile people.

854
01:12:01,842 --> 01:12:05,305
Um, come on. Some of us
spent Christmas at her house.

855
01:12:05,388 --> 01:12:09,142
I don't know her.

856
01:12:09,226 --> 01:12:13,020
He hasn't called.
He's hardly written.

857
01:12:13,062 --> 01:12:15,191
Just these cryptic
notes, you know?

858
01:12:15,274 --> 01:12:17,317
You don't just dump people.

859
01:12:17,401 --> 01:12:21,029
Look, will we see you later,
Or are you with people?

860
01:12:21,071 --> 01:12:24,074
- Uh, I can't later.
- Well, how about tomorrow?

861
01:12:24,157 --> 01:12:26,076
Yes, uh,
maybe in the morning?

862
01:12:26,160 --> 01:12:29,829
Do you know Cafe Dinelli
at the Piazza di Spagna?

863
01:12:29,913 --> 01:12:33,376
- I know the Piazza. What time?
- 10:30?

864
01:12:33,459 --> 01:12:35,712
- We'll be there.
- Okay.

865
01:12:35,754 --> 01:12:37,797
So I'll see you
in the morning, Marge?

866
01:12:37,880 --> 01:12:40,925
10:30?
Very nice to meet you.

867
01:12:41,008 --> 01:12:43,052
And you.

868
01:12:45,929 --> 01:12:47,807
Come on.

869
01:12:47,890 --> 01:12:51,811
Come on.
Let's go back in.

870
01:12:57,734 --> 01:13:00,820
I don't understand why
Tom's still in Rome.

871
01:13:00,904 --> 01:13:05,158
- Let's go.
- I thought you were enjoying yourself.

872
01:13:05,242 --> 01:13:07,535
Let's take a carrozza
and look at the moon.

873
01:13:07,619 --> 01:13:09,538
Are you crazy?
It's freezing out there.

874
01:13:09,621 --> 01:13:12,415
Come on. I need to talk to you.
Just the two of us.

875
01:13:12,498 --> 01:13:14,585
Okay.

876
01:13:18,380 --> 01:13:20,883
Don't worry, please.

877
01:13:20,966 --> 01:13:23,802
Don't worry.

878
01:13:23,886 --> 01:13:27,973
You're such a pal
to understand. I...

879
01:13:28,057 --> 01:13:30,184
It's like Marge is here
right now. I look at you,

880
01:13:30,268 --> 01:13:32,353
and I see her face.

881
01:13:32,436 --> 01:13:35,189
And I can't... No matter
what I'm feeling towards you...

882
01:13:35,272 --> 01:13:40,653
No. I absolutely...
understand. Ofc...

883
01:13:40,695 --> 01:13:44,198
Otherwise, you'd be
fighting me off.

884
01:13:44,281 --> 01:13:46,243
Beating you away.

885
01:14:24,907 --> 01:14:28,160
But will you meet me
tomorrow?

886
01:14:28,202 --> 01:14:31,455
Just to say good-bye properly,
you know, in the daylight,

887
01:14:31,539 --> 01:14:33,666
so it's not just this.

888
01:14:33,750 --> 01:14:36,502
Of course. Meredith, I'm sorry.
Of course I'll meet you.

889
01:14:36,586 --> 01:14:41,841
You should always
save pain for daylight.

890
01:14:41,882 --> 01:14:45,178
Why don't we have coffee
in the morning at Dinelli's?

891
01:14:45,262 --> 01:14:47,430
Uh, by the Spanish Steps.

892
01:14:47,514 --> 01:14:49,348
Exactly. 10:30?

893
01:14:52,060 --> 01:14:54,687
- 10:15.
- Okay.

894
01:14:54,729 --> 01:14:56,899
Okay.

895
01:15:48,117 --> 01:15:50,453
- Grazie.
- Peter?

896
01:15:50,537 --> 01:15:54,041
Hello.
It's Meredith Logue.

897
01:15:54,125 --> 01:15:56,793
Of course it is.
Meredith, hello. Sorry.

898
01:15:56,876 --> 01:15:59,922
- I was half asleep. How are you?
- How are you?

899
01:16:00,005 --> 01:16:02,382
This is Marge Sherwood.
Meredith Logue.

900
01:16:02,424 --> 01:16:05,470
How do you do?

901
01:16:05,553 --> 01:16:08,889
Do join us, won't you?
We're just waiting for a friend.

902
01:16:08,930 --> 01:16:11,684
I... I won't, actually.
I think there's...

903
01:16:11,767 --> 01:16:14,353
- Did we see you at the opera last night?
- Uh...

904
01:16:14,436 --> 01:16:17,147
Are you waiting for Dickie?

905
01:16:17,231 --> 01:16:21,361
Dickie? Do you... Do you...
Do you know Dickie?

906
01:16:21,444 --> 01:16:24,571
You were at the opera.
Oh, that explains... Yes, I was there.

907
01:16:24,655 --> 01:16:28,201
I was there with Dickie.

908
01:16:29,285 --> 01:16:32,038
I knew it.

909
01:16:32,122 --> 01:16:34,332
I told you.

910
01:16:36,417 --> 01:16:40,922
Marge, I don't know you,
so I've got no right to...

911
01:16:41,005 --> 01:16:44,218
Dickie loves you.
He's... Well...

912
01:16:44,301 --> 01:16:47,428
I think you'll find
he's on his way home to you.

913
01:16:47,511 --> 01:16:51,557
Well, how-how-how
would you know that?

914
01:16:52,809 --> 01:16:55,354
He... told me everything.

915
01:16:55,437 --> 01:17:00,359
No, I was supposed to meet him
15 minutes ago, so, uh,

916
01:17:00,443 --> 01:17:02,860
I'm gonna go now,
I think.

917
01:17:05,155 --> 01:17:07,241
God, unless he meant us
to meet.

918
01:17:07,325 --> 01:17:09,494
That'd be a little cruel,
wouldn't it?

919
01:17:09,577 --> 01:17:11,995
No, no, we're
meeting another friend.

920
01:17:12,037 --> 01:17:14,874
- Tom Ripley.
- Do you know Tom Ripley?

921
01:17:14,957 --> 01:17:19,796
No, no. I've heard about him,
of course, but I didn't meet him, no.

922
01:17:19,838 --> 01:17:22,340
Not for me. No, grazie.

923
01:17:27,679 --> 01:17:30,598
Hope I didn't
complicate matters.

924
01:17:30,682 --> 01:17:36,021
God, nothing, nothing...
untoward happened.

925
01:17:36,063 --> 01:17:40,316
No, there is nothing to prevent you
from welcoming him back,

926
01:17:40,358 --> 01:17:42,319
from marrying him.

927
01:17:46,865 --> 01:17:49,576
Good-bye.
I'm happy to put a face to a name.

928
01:17:49,659 --> 01:17:52,163
Good-bye, Peter.
Please, don't get up.

929
01:18:12,683 --> 01:18:15,811
Now I don't know what to think.
Do you think he's coming back?

930
01:18:17,396 --> 01:18:20,816
Sorry. Sorry.
Had to renew my papers.

931
01:18:20,900 --> 01:18:23,235
Never one stamp when they
can make you line up for three.

932
01:18:23,277 --> 01:18:25,405
- Have you been waiting long?
- Not at all.

933
01:18:25,488 --> 01:18:28,199
- Morning, Tom.
- Hi. Sorry.

934
01:18:28,282 --> 01:18:30,243
You okay? You look like
you've seen a ghost.

935
01:18:30,285 --> 01:18:32,996
Dickie was at the opera
last night.

936
01:18:33,079 --> 01:18:36,416
I don't believe that. Uh...
Wild horses couldn't drag Dickie...

937
01:18:36,458 --> 01:18:38,751
Well, he was there
with someone, you know,

938
01:18:38,835 --> 01:18:41,338
so I suppose she must
have dragged him.

939
01:18:41,421 --> 01:18:44,257
It's not fair.

940
01:18:44,299 --> 01:18:48,470
I think I'm going back to Mongi.
I think Dickie's coming home.

941
01:18:48,553 --> 01:18:51,182
Really? I... Well,
that's just swell.

942
01:18:51,265 --> 01:18:53,893
No, you know, you're
way ahead of me. Great.

943
01:18:53,976 --> 01:18:55,936
That was rather moving
when I heard... I'm sorry.

944
01:18:56,019 --> 01:18:58,439
Meredith is the American girl
I saw at the opera last night.

945
01:18:58,481 --> 01:19:02,568
- She's been seeing something of Dickie.
- Oh, my God.

946
01:19:02,652 --> 01:19:06,113
But the point is,
Dickie... and we all know this.

947
01:19:06,196 --> 01:19:09,867
Dickie loves Marge.
And he misses her.

948
01:19:09,951 --> 01:19:12,704
I feel guilty.
Marge doesn't understand this,

949
01:19:12,788 --> 01:19:15,623
but whenever Dickie does
something, I feel guilty.

950
01:19:15,706 --> 01:19:18,001
As if that makes sense.

951
01:20:41,420 --> 01:20:43,380
Dickie.

952
01:20:45,049 --> 01:20:47,426
Dickie, come on. It's me.

953
01:20:49,887 --> 01:20:51,805
It's Freddie.
Let me in.

954
01:20:54,851 --> 01:20:56,769
Dickie.

955
01:21:02,067 --> 01:21:04,860
Hello, Freddie.
It's Tom.

956
01:21:05,946 --> 01:21:08,907
Um, where's Dickie?

957
01:21:08,948 --> 01:21:10,909
How are you?

958
01:21:10,951 --> 01:21:14,036
I'm good. Uh, yes, thank you.
He's gone. He went to dinner.

959
01:21:14,078 --> 01:21:18,458
- He's at Otello's. You know Otello's?
- No, no, no.

960
01:21:18,541 --> 01:21:21,336
I... I don't think
he's at dinner at 6:30 PM.

961
01:21:21,420 --> 01:21:24,715
If you said he was still at lunch,
maybe I'd believe you.

962
01:21:24,756 --> 01:21:28,385
You know?
Incredible.

963
01:21:28,427 --> 01:21:32,389
I mean, the guy just, you know,
disappeared off the face of the earth.

964
01:21:34,558 --> 01:21:36,477
I guess.

965
01:21:37,603 --> 01:21:40,689
The landlady,
as far as I could tell...

966
01:21:40,773 --> 01:21:44,568
The landlady said
he was here right now.

967
01:21:44,610 --> 01:21:46,862
Search the place.

968
01:21:46,945 --> 01:21:50,324
I... I just don't... I don't know why you'd
imagine that Dickie would hide from you.

969
01:21:50,407 --> 01:21:52,326
Because he's been
hiding from me.

970
01:21:54,496 --> 01:21:58,332
- What happened at Christmas?
- What about Christmas?

971
01:21:58,416 --> 01:22:01,545
He was supposed to come skiing.
I didn't get a cable...

972
01:22:01,628 --> 01:22:03,838
or a call or a little note or a...

973
01:22:03,923 --> 01:22:08,426
Frankly, a fart.

974
01:22:08,509 --> 01:22:10,763
Well, he's been very involved
with his music.

975
01:22:10,845 --> 01:22:15,059
Um, I think his theory... is...

976
01:22:15,142 --> 01:22:19,730
that you have to go into a cocoon,
uh, before you can be a butterfly.

977
01:22:19,813 --> 01:22:22,357
Which is horseshit.

978
01:22:22,440 --> 01:22:25,903
You hear him play this thing?
Well, he can't.

979
01:22:28,781 --> 01:22:30,867
How did you find him?

980
01:22:30,950 --> 01:22:33,952
It's such an out-of-the-way apartment.
Can I fix you a drink?

981
01:22:33,994 --> 01:22:36,998
No, thanks.
At the American Express.

982
01:22:40,418 --> 01:22:42,837
Some kid.

983
01:22:48,343 --> 01:22:51,304
Are you living here?

984
01:22:51,345 --> 01:22:54,473
No, no. I'm staying here
for a few days.

985
01:22:57,143 --> 01:22:59,813
But...

986
01:22:59,854 --> 01:23:03,566
It's a new piano.
Probably shouldn't...

987
01:23:08,112 --> 01:23:10,699
Probably shouldn't...

988
01:23:13,661 --> 01:23:17,414
Did this place come furnished?

989
01:23:17,497 --> 01:23:20,668
It doesn't
Look like Dickie's, uh...

990
01:23:20,751 --> 01:23:23,836
It's really horrible,
isn't it?

991
01:23:25,423 --> 01:23:28,925
It's so, uh, bourgeois.

992
01:23:38,435 --> 01:23:40,647
Oh, that's a, uh...
You should... Watch that.

993
01:23:40,730 --> 01:23:43,858
Excuse...
Excuse me.

994
01:23:43,900 --> 01:23:45,861
Excuse me.

995
01:23:48,864 --> 01:23:53,534
In fact, the only thing that looks
like Dickie... is you.

996
01:23:53,576 --> 01:23:55,620
- Hardly.
- Hmm.

997
01:23:57,581 --> 01:24:00,291
Have you done something
to your hair?

998
01:24:00,374 --> 01:24:02,378
Is there something
you'd like to say, Freddie?

999
01:24:02,461 --> 01:24:04,879
- What?
- You have something you'd like to say?

1000
01:24:04,921 --> 01:24:07,299
I think I'm saying it.

1001
01:24:08,759 --> 01:24:11,886
Something's going on.

1002
01:24:11,969 --> 01:24:14,806
Either he's converted
to Christianity,

1003
01:24:16,016 --> 01:24:17,934
or there's something else.

1004
01:24:19,395 --> 01:24:21,521
Well, I would suggest you
ask Dickie that yourself.

1005
01:24:21,605 --> 01:24:24,484
Otello's is on della Croce
just off the Corso.

1006
01:24:24,567 --> 01:24:28,028
Is it on della Croce
just off the Corso?

1007
01:24:30,114 --> 01:24:34,369
Sure. You're a
quick study, aren't you?

1008
01:24:34,453 --> 01:24:36,371
Last time you didn't know
you ass from your elbow.

1009
01:24:36,454 --> 01:24:38,873
Now you're giving me directions.

1010
01:24:38,956 --> 01:24:42,710
That's not fair. You probably
do know your ass from your elbow.

1011
01:24:45,631 --> 01:24:47,549
I'll see you.

1012
01:24:59,685 --> 01:25:02,272
No Dickie Greenleaf. Thomas Ripley.

1013
01:25:02,355 --> 01:25:05,775
Si.

1014
01:25:10,990 --> 01:25:12,950
Ciao, Dickie.

1015
01:25:17,455 --> 01:25:19,916
Dickie doesn't
play the piano.

1016
01:25:21,458 --> 01:25:23,377
Tommy.

1017
01:25:23,461 --> 01:25:25,379
Tommy!

1018
01:25:25,462 --> 01:25:27,381
Tommy!

1019
01:26:05,921 --> 01:26:08,715
Oh!
You're making me laugh.

1020
01:26:08,799 --> 01:26:12,595
No. You're just so drunk.
Oh. You're just...

1021
01:26:12,678 --> 01:26:16,015
What can you do, eh?
You should see my other friends.

1022
01:26:16,057 --> 01:26:18,476
What can you do?

1023
01:26:18,559 --> 01:26:21,771
Yes.
Such a pig.

1024
01:26:25,274 --> 01:26:30,530
Hey, if I'm drunk,
think what her husband's saying.

1025
01:27:17,954 --> 01:27:20,332
- La polizia.
- Dickie Greenleaf?

1026
01:27:20,415 --> 01:27:23,417
- Yes.
- Inspector Roverini.

1027
01:27:23,500 --> 01:27:25,503
- Can we come in?
- Please.

1028
01:27:33,261 --> 01:27:35,555
It's a terrible shock,
huh?

1029
01:27:35,638 --> 01:27:39,350
W... What time did Signor Miles
leave yesterday?

1030
01:27:39,434 --> 01:27:43,439
Oh, um, I can't be
certain exactly. I...

1031
01:27:43,522 --> 01:27:45,440
8:00, 9:00.

1032
01:27:48,319 --> 01:27:52,740
We'd both taken on, uh,
far too many drinks.

1033
01:27:52,782 --> 01:27:57,369
But it was dark. It was certainly dark
when I... when I walked him to his car.

1034
01:27:57,453 --> 01:28:00,414
So he drove away,
and, uh, you did what?

1035
01:28:00,456 --> 01:28:03,543
I went to bed.

1036
01:28:03,626 --> 01:28:08,297
Freddie's a big man, but I'm in trouble
after a couple of drinks.

1037
01:28:08,380 --> 01:28:11,759
I've been suffering all...

1038
01:28:11,800 --> 01:28:13,886
Who found him?

1039
01:28:13,970 --> 01:28:16,556
You understand, I must ask you...

1040
01:28:16,639 --> 01:28:19,183
to stay in Rome,
Signor Greenleaf.

1041
01:28:19,267 --> 01:28:22,604
Yes, if it's gonna help,
certainly.

1042
01:28:22,646 --> 01:28:26,441
So, the doctor, he has to make
the, um...

1043
01:28:29,944 --> 01:28:33,156
- Postmortem.
- Yeah, exactly.

1044
01:28:33,240 --> 01:28:35,910
But, you know,
his first conclusion...

1045
01:28:35,993 --> 01:28:41,039
was that Signor Miles was killed
not later than 7:00 yesterday evening.

1046
01:28:41,123 --> 01:28:44,501
Well, he certainly wasn't dead
when he drove away in his car.

1047
01:28:46,629 --> 01:28:48,547
No.

1048
01:29:13,865 --> 01:29:16,367
It's okay.

1049
01:29:16,451 --> 01:29:18,829
- Okay?
- Si, si.

1050
01:29:29,214 --> 01:29:32,843
- Did he kill Freddie?
- Marge. When did you get here?

1051
01:29:32,884 --> 01:29:35,513
Tell me the truth.
Did he kill Freddie?

1052
01:29:35,596 --> 01:29:39,140
I'd swear he didn't.
Of course he didn't.

1053
01:29:39,224 --> 01:29:43,437
I tried again.
Waiting here, watching for him.

1054
01:29:43,520 --> 01:29:47,107
Instead, it's you.
Whenever I look for Dickie, I find you.

1055
01:29:49,026 --> 01:29:51,987
What happened to your face?

1056
01:29:52,071 --> 01:29:54,031
Dickie...
Dickie did it.

1057
01:29:54,072 --> 01:29:56,325
- Dickie?
- My face. There was an argument.

1058
01:29:56,409 --> 01:29:59,078
I... I said some things
I shouldn't have said and I...

1059
01:29:59,161 --> 01:30:02,791
About you. About the appalling way
he's treating you, all of us.

1060
01:30:02,874 --> 01:30:05,168
And the next thing I know,
he's launched himself at me.

1061
01:30:05,251 --> 01:30:07,379
- Are you getting on?
- What?

1062
01:30:07,421 --> 01:30:09,589
Get on.
I'll take you to him.

1063
01:30:54,093 --> 01:30:56,304
- Where does he live?
- We passed it a few blocks back.

1064
01:30:56,387 --> 01:30:58,806
It's where the police were.
The Palazzo Gioia.

1065
01:31:00,809 --> 01:31:03,811
Look, they don't even know I'm in Rome,
and I'm not gonna incriminate Dickie.

1066
01:31:03,853 --> 01:31:05,897
Well, perhaps
I shouldn't go either.

1067
01:31:05,981 --> 01:31:09,608
No. Well, go if you want to, but just
don't talk to the police about my face.

1068
01:31:09,650 --> 01:31:13,030
If they know he hit me and his temper,
then he could've hit Freddie.

1069
01:31:13,113 --> 01:31:15,073
I'll catch up
with you later.

1070
01:31:33,301 --> 01:31:36,262
Signor Greenleaf!

1071
01:31:36,345 --> 01:31:38,931
It's Signor Greenleaf!
Presto, presto!

1072
01:31:44,395 --> 01:31:46,605
Open the door!

1073
01:31:46,689 --> 01:31:49,067
Open up!

1074
01:31:49,150 --> 01:31:51,402
I live here!

1075
01:31:52,569 --> 01:31:54,531
Mr. Greenleaf!

1076
01:31:55,865 --> 01:31:58,075
Can we go up?
Do you mind?

1077
01:31:58,159 --> 01:32:00,745
Of course.
What happened to your face?

1078
01:32:00,829 --> 01:32:04,499
My scooter. I fell off
getting chased by photographers.

1079
01:32:04,583 --> 01:32:08,627
The telephone, the press,
I've been... I'm feeling hounded.

1080
01:32:08,711 --> 01:32:10,839
Do you think you could
not give out my address?

1081
01:32:10,880 --> 01:32:15,510
Never. We've had many requests,
and we say no, even to your fiancée.

1082
01:32:15,594 --> 01:32:17,555
I really don't want
to see anybody.

1083
01:32:17,596 --> 01:32:20,390
- Even your fiancée?
- Even her.

1084
01:32:23,477 --> 01:32:26,689
- What about Thomas Ripley?
- What about Tom Ripley?

1085
01:32:28,691 --> 01:32:30,692
You and Signor Ripley went to San Remo.
Is that right?

1086
01:32:30,734 --> 01:32:33,862
Yes, we... We went to San Remo.
That was months ago.

1087
01:32:33,946 --> 01:32:36,114
November, I thought.
Was it?

1088
01:32:36,198 --> 01:32:39,744
- Did you speak to Tom?
- November 7 is my information.

1089
01:32:39,827 --> 01:32:42,581
I don't remember
the exact date.

1090
01:32:42,622 --> 01:32:47,084
- When did you last see Signor Ripley?
- A few days ago.

1091
01:32:47,126 --> 01:32:50,713
- Does he stay with you here?
- No.

1092
01:32:50,797 --> 01:32:53,175
No.

1093
01:32:54,550 --> 01:32:57,512
Here is a pattern.
Two days ago,

1094
01:32:57,595 --> 01:33:00,557
Freddie Miles is dead, hmm?

1095
01:33:01,808 --> 01:33:04,269
He leaves your apartment,

1096
01:33:05,354 --> 01:33:08,105
and he's murdered.

1097
01:33:08,189 --> 01:33:13,319
Yesterday, a little boat
is found in San Remo full of rocks.

1098
01:33:13,403 --> 01:33:18,283
And the owner tells the police
it was stolen on November7.

1099
01:33:18,325 --> 01:33:20,828
We look at hotel records...

1100
01:33:20,912 --> 01:33:23,706
and we see...

1101
01:33:23,789 --> 01:33:26,959
Dickie Greenleaf
is staying in San Remo.

1102
01:33:27,042 --> 01:33:30,796
And then our boatman remembers
two Americans taking a boat.

1103
01:33:30,880 --> 01:33:33,674
That is not a pattern.
That's a coincidence.

1104
01:33:33,757 --> 01:33:35,718
There must be 50 hotels
in San Remo.

1105
01:33:35,802 --> 01:33:38,638
There were probably a hundred people
renting a boat that day.

1106
01:33:38,679 --> 01:33:41,183
Thirty-one people.

1107
01:33:41,266 --> 01:33:43,268
Thirty-one people.

1108
01:33:44,393 --> 01:33:46,312
Thirty-one, yeah.

1109
01:33:48,565 --> 01:33:51,151
- Marge Sherwood.
- That is Miss Sherwood now.

1110
01:33:59,910 --> 01:34:01,953
Let her in.

1111
01:34:01,995 --> 01:34:04,665
Let her in.
What's the difference? Let her in.

1112
01:34:07,125 --> 01:34:10,546
No! Actually...
Actually, no.

1113
01:34:10,629 --> 01:34:13,508
I would... I would
really appreciate it...

1114
01:34:13,591 --> 01:34:16,468
if you would ask Miss Sherwood
to come back later.

1115
01:34:21,014 --> 01:34:23,850
Thank you.

1116
01:34:23,935 --> 01:34:27,522
May I ask you...

1117
01:34:27,605 --> 01:34:31,150
Why would you speak to your friend
and not your fiancée?

1118
01:34:31,234 --> 01:34:34,569
Well, I...
I think I just said.

1119
01:34:34,654 --> 01:34:37,990
Um, Mr. Ripley was
handling some business for me.

1120
01:34:38,032 --> 01:34:40,660
Nor does Mr. Ripley
want to marry me...

1121
01:34:40,744 --> 01:34:44,789
and ask me every single day
if I'll marry him and when.

1122
01:34:45,957 --> 01:34:47,959
Do you keep a photograph
Of Signor Ripley?

1123
01:34:48,043 --> 01:34:51,880
I'm not in the habit of carrying
around photographs of my male friends.

1124
01:34:53,548 --> 01:34:55,466
Now I think I've upset you.

1125
01:34:55,550 --> 01:34:58,679
Sorry. My English,
perhaps, is coarse.

1126
01:34:58,720 --> 01:35:01,223
It is a little coarse,
yes.

1127
01:35:04,726 --> 01:35:06,644
I'm sorry.

1128
01:35:06,728 --> 01:35:11,691
But you... No one has seen
Signor Ripley since San Remo.

1129
01:35:11,775 --> 01:35:13,736
- I have.
- You have, yes.

1130
01:35:13,777 --> 01:35:16,530
And so has Miss Sherwood.
Ask her. And, um,

1131
01:35:16,572 --> 01:35:21,702
if I can remember the name
of the hotel he was staying at...

1132
01:35:21,786 --> 01:35:24,830
Um, the Goldoni.
Tom was staying at the Goldoni.

1133
01:35:24,914 --> 01:35:28,293
Goldoni. The Goldoni.
Good, good, but...

1134
01:35:28,376 --> 01:35:30,920
Yes, you are right.

1135
01:35:31,004 --> 01:35:33,256
You are right.
A coincidence.

1136
01:35:35,342 --> 01:35:38,929
I look forward
to our next meeting.

1137
01:35:39,012 --> 01:35:41,014
Hmm? When I will be more
careful with my English.

1138
01:35:41,097 --> 01:35:45,351
Ah. I have a witness
who thinks they saw two men...

1139
01:35:45,435 --> 01:35:47,354
getting into Mr. Miles' car.

1140
01:35:47,437 --> 01:35:51,316
And she wants to identify you
in a confronto.

1141
01:35:51,400 --> 01:35:53,902
Lineup. Tomorrow, then?

1142
01:35:55,404 --> 01:35:57,322
Uh, tomorrow.

1143
01:36:04,955 --> 01:36:06,874
- Buon giorno, Miss Sherwood.
- Buon giorno.

1144
01:36:06,957 --> 01:36:11,086
He's in, but I really don't think
he wants to meet anybody.

1145
01:36:28,480 --> 01:36:30,440
Dick?

1146
01:36:33,902 --> 01:36:36,070
Dickie?

1147
01:36:37,614 --> 01:36:39,533
I know you can hear me.

1148
01:36:48,375 --> 01:36:51,669
I was gonna say that I would count to
three, and if you didn't open the door...

1149
01:36:51,753 --> 01:36:56,007
But I won't count anymore.

1150
01:36:56,091 --> 01:36:58,093
On you.

1151
01:37:00,138 --> 01:37:03,640
I won't count on you
anymore.

1152
01:37:07,103 --> 01:37:12,024
Whatever it is you've done
or haven't done,

1153
01:37:12,066 --> 01:37:14,568
you've broken my heart.

1154
01:37:16,821 --> 01:37:19,240
That's one thing
I know you're guilty of.

1155
01:37:26,832 --> 01:37:29,250
And I don't know why.

1156
01:37:31,754 --> 01:37:35,173
I don't know why.
I just don't know why.

1157
01:37:45,017 --> 01:37:47,227
My dear Tom.

1158
01:37:47,310 --> 01:37:50,855
I'm getting out of this.

1159
01:37:50,897 --> 01:37:54,443
Freddie's death. Silvana.

1160
01:37:54,527 --> 01:37:58,740
I've thought about going to the police,
but I can't do it.

1161
01:37:58,781 --> 01:38:01,158
I can't face it.

1162
01:38:01,242 --> 01:38:03,995
I can't face anything anymore.

1163
01:38:04,079 --> 01:38:06,830
I wish I could give you
the life I took for granted.

1164
01:38:09,918 --> 01:38:12,461
You've always understood
what's at the heart of me, Tom.

1165
01:38:12,545 --> 01:38:15,923
Marge never could.

1166
01:38:15,965 --> 01:38:19,385
I suppose that's why
I'm writing this to you,

1167
01:38:19,427 --> 01:38:22,055
the brother I never had.

1168
01:38:22,139 --> 01:38:24,891
The only true friend
I ever had.

1169
01:38:30,564 --> 01:38:32,482
In all kinds of ways,

1170
01:38:32,566 --> 01:38:36,862
you're much more like the son
my father wanted.

1171
01:38:36,945 --> 01:38:40,157
I realize you can
change the people,

1172
01:38:40,240 --> 01:38:42,743
change the scenery,

1173
01:38:42,785 --> 01:38:44,995
but you can't change
your own rotten self.

1174
01:38:47,789 --> 01:38:50,542
Now I can't think what to do
or where to go.

1175
01:38:52,628 --> 01:38:57,215
I'm haunted by everything
I've done and can't undo.

1176
01:38:58,802 --> 01:39:00,761
I'm sorry.

1177
01:39:02,847 --> 01:39:06,225
I've made a mess of being
Dickie Greenleaf, haven't I?

1178
01:40:10,583 --> 01:40:13,587
Tom!

1179
01:40:15,755 --> 01:40:19,050
I'll see you over there!

1180
01:40:27,434 --> 01:40:29,728
I'm so sorry to put you
through this, Peter.

1181
01:40:29,812 --> 01:40:33,398
I just can't face going to the police
by myself when my Italian's so rotten.

1182
01:40:33,481 --> 01:40:35,484
Don't be so daft.
It's fine.

1183
01:40:35,567 --> 01:40:38,195
I'm delighted you finally
made it to Venice.

1184
01:40:38,278 --> 01:40:40,906
I'm delighted, contrary to rumor,
that you're still in one piece.

1185
01:40:40,990 --> 01:40:42,992
- What rumor?
- Oh, you know.

1186
01:40:43,075 --> 01:40:46,495
That Dickie murdered you
and is traveling under your passport.

1187
01:40:46,578 --> 01:40:48,664
I know. It's ridiculous.

1188
01:41:03,513 --> 01:41:05,431
Welcome to Venice.

1189
01:41:05,514 --> 01:41:08,560
God, this place reeks, doesn't it?
Can you smell it?

1190
01:41:08,602 --> 01:41:12,481
Anyway, I've got to
the bottom of the delay, finally.

1191
01:41:12,564 --> 01:41:15,484
We're waiting
for someone from Rome.

1192
01:41:15,567 --> 01:41:17,903
What do you mean?
They've sent for someone from Rome?

1193
01:41:17,945 --> 01:41:21,072
- Well, yes. That's good, isn't it?
- No, I thought...

1194
01:41:21,155 --> 01:41:24,535
that didn't happen in Italy,
that each region is separate.

1195
01:41:24,618 --> 01:41:27,037
I was sure that...
I've read that...

1196
01:41:27,120 --> 01:41:29,956
You've read the papers.
You know what a big deal it's been.

1197
01:41:30,040 --> 01:41:33,085
- American tourist murdered.
- Actually, can we not do this now?

1198
01:41:33,169 --> 01:41:37,255
The stench really is...

1199
01:41:54,525 --> 01:41:59,154
He's taken over the case, 'cause they're
annoyed that the previous chap...

1200
01:41:59,237 --> 01:42:02,115
let Dickie disappear
when he was, um,

1201
01:42:02,156 --> 01:42:04,158
the only suspect
in Freddie's murder.

1202
01:42:07,204 --> 01:42:10,499
In Rome,
about three weeks ago.

1203
01:42:10,541 --> 01:42:12,501
I knew that one.

1204
01:42:19,717 --> 01:42:24,554
Are you a homosexual?
Interesting non sequitur.

1205
01:42:24,638 --> 01:42:26,641
No.

1206
01:42:26,725 --> 01:42:29,977
- No.
- Oh.

1207
01:42:30,018 --> 01:42:34,940
By the way, um, officially
there are no Italian homosexuals.

1208
01:42:35,024 --> 01:42:37,527
Makes Michelangelo and
Leonardo very inconvenient.

1209
01:42:37,611 --> 01:42:39,320
Eh?

1210
01:42:39,362 --> 01:42:42,574
Tell him...
I have a fiancée.

1211
01:42:42,658 --> 01:42:45,035
And Dickie has a fiancée.

1212
01:42:45,075 --> 01:42:48,705
And that Freddie Miles
probably had a string of them.

1213
01:43:00,384 --> 01:43:04,263
Mamma mia.

1214
01:43:07,850 --> 01:43:10,061
- What did he say?
- He says "so many fiancées."

1215
01:43:15,232 --> 01:43:18,235
He's asking... if you
Killed Freddie Miles...

1216
01:43:18,277 --> 01:43:20,238
and then killed Dickie Greenleaf.

1217
01:43:20,279 --> 01:43:24,241
No! No, I did not kill Freddie Miles
and then kill Dickie Greenleaf.

1218
01:43:24,324 --> 01:43:27,537
Is he accusing me?
Ask him if he's accusing me.

1219
01:43:27,578 --> 01:43:30,373
The way it works here,
it's better to be less volatile.

1220
01:43:30,414 --> 01:43:32,584
But it's absurd!

1221
01:43:48,100 --> 01:43:52,563
They found this
in Dickie's place in Rome.

1222
01:43:52,646 --> 01:43:55,232
- You opened this?
- Of course.

1223
01:44:11,540 --> 01:44:14,376
It's a suicide note.

1224
01:44:18,172 --> 01:44:22,051
You asked me all these questions and you
already read this suicide note?

1225
01:44:40,403 --> 01:44:42,489
I don't believe that letter.
Do you?

1226
01:44:42,572 --> 01:44:46,117
Dickie's letter.
Do you believe it?

1227
01:44:46,159 --> 01:44:48,620
I don't know
what to believe.

1228
01:44:48,661 --> 01:44:53,375
Can you imagine, though, if he did
kill Freddie, what that must be like?

1229
01:44:53,500 --> 01:44:57,338
Just to wake up every morning.
I mean, how can you?

1230
01:44:57,420 --> 01:45:00,882
Just wake up and be a person?
Drink your coffee.

1231
01:45:00,966 --> 01:45:05,387
Well, what ever you do,
however terrible, however hurtful,

1232
01:45:05,429 --> 01:45:08,766
it all makes sense,
doesn't it, in your head.

1233
01:45:08,807 --> 01:45:11,601
You never meet anybody
who thinks they're a bad person.

1234
01:45:11,643 --> 01:45:15,689
No, I know, but you're still tormented.
You must be. You've killed someone.

1235
01:45:15,772 --> 01:45:18,901
Don't you just take the past
and put it in a room in the basement,

1236
01:45:18,985 --> 01:45:20,945
and lock the door
and never go in there?

1237
01:45:21,028 --> 01:45:24,407
- That's what I do.
- God, yes.

1238
01:45:24,449 --> 01:45:29,121
But, of course, in my case,
it's probably a whole building.

1239
01:45:29,163 --> 01:45:32,206
And then you meet someone special,

1240
01:45:32,290 --> 01:45:36,335
and all you want to do
is toss them the key.

1241
01:45:37,670 --> 01:45:40,257
Say "Open up. Step inside."

1242
01:45:42,968 --> 01:45:45,179
But you can't...

1243
01:45:45,263 --> 01:45:48,014
because it's dark...

1244
01:45:48,097 --> 01:45:50,976
and there are demons.

1245
01:45:52,019 --> 01:45:54,479
And if anybody saw
how ugly it is...

1246
01:45:59,192 --> 01:46:01,237
Now that's the music talking.

1247
01:46:03,489 --> 01:46:06,826
It's harder to be bleak if you're
playing "Knees Up, Mother Brown."

1248
01:46:12,540 --> 01:46:15,501
I keep wanting to do that.

1249
01:46:15,584 --> 01:46:19,464
Fling...
the door open.

1250
01:46:21,840 --> 01:46:25,595
Just let the light in,
clean everything out.

1251
01:46:27,890 --> 01:46:31,893
If I could take a giant eraser
and rub out everything,

1252
01:46:31,976 --> 01:46:34,896
starting with myself...

1253
01:46:37,482 --> 01:46:40,694
The thing is, Peter, if...

1254
01:46:43,238 --> 01:46:46,867
- Hmm?
- If...

1255
01:46:48,702 --> 01:46:50,663
If...

1256
01:46:57,711 --> 01:47:00,048
No key, huh?

1257
01:47:44,468 --> 01:47:46,469
- Marge.
- Peter.

1258
01:47:48,931 --> 01:47:50,891
- So good to see you.
- Hello, Marge.

1259
01:47:50,932 --> 01:47:53,143
Tom.

1260
01:47:53,226 --> 01:47:57,273
- I see you found Peter.
- I think we sort of found each other.

1261
01:47:57,356 --> 01:48:01,068
- Where's Dickie's father?
- He's not coming till the morning.

1262
01:48:01,152 --> 01:48:04,697
Evidently his stomach. I don't think
the food here is agreeing with him.

1263
01:48:04,780 --> 01:48:06,700
Oh, I was looking forward
to seeing him.

1264
01:48:06,782 --> 01:48:09,493
Dickie hasn't killed himself.
I'm sure of that.

1265
01:48:09,576 --> 01:48:12,121
There's a private detective
on the case now.

1266
01:48:12,205 --> 01:48:14,707
A Mr. MacCarron
Dickie's father's employed.

1267
01:48:14,790 --> 01:48:18,128
- That's a terrific idea.
- He's American.

1268
01:48:18,210 --> 01:48:21,548
He's already discovered
that Dickie cashed checks for $1,000...

1269
01:48:21,631 --> 01:48:23,800
the day before
he disappeared.

1270
01:48:23,883 --> 01:48:25,802
Signora.

1271
01:48:25,886 --> 01:48:29,306
Is that what you do
before you jump into the Tiber?

1272
01:48:29,389 --> 01:48:31,975
I don't think so.

1273
01:48:35,812 --> 01:48:38,023
- Is this you?
- No, it's Tom's.

1274
01:48:38,107 --> 01:48:40,025
Splendid, eh?

1275
01:48:40,108 --> 01:48:43,445
Golly.
Who's paying for this?

1276
01:48:43,487 --> 01:48:45,489
Peter found it for me.

1277
01:48:45,530 --> 01:48:50,452
I can afford it because
it's damp and... falling down.

1278
01:48:50,494 --> 01:48:53,664
- Tom's transformed it.
- This is spectacular.

1279
01:48:53,748 --> 01:48:56,000
That's why
Tom wanted you to stay.

1280
01:48:56,083 --> 01:48:58,670
It's better than trying
to squeeze into my room.

1281
01:48:58,753 --> 01:49:00,838
And I know
How you hate hotels.

1282
01:49:00,922 --> 01:49:02,923
A hotel would have been fine.

1283
01:49:06,385 --> 01:49:10,932
We'll have to tell Mr. Greenleaf
how far his dollar stretched.

1284
01:49:14,311 --> 01:49:17,314
What's funny?

1285
01:49:17,397 --> 01:49:20,942
I was just thinking about when
Tom first came to Mongibello.

1286
01:49:22,986 --> 01:49:26,449
- And look at you now.
- Look at me what?

1287
01:49:27,699 --> 01:49:29,701
To the manor born.

1288
01:49:43,841 --> 01:49:46,051
Mr. Greenleaf?

1289
01:49:49,930 --> 01:49:51,891
Mr. Greenleaf?

1290
01:49:51,933 --> 01:49:55,645
Tom. How are you?
You look well.

1291
01:49:55,728 --> 01:49:58,564
- Thank you, sir. I am well.
- Far cry from New York.

1292
01:49:58,606 --> 01:50:01,108
- Yes, it is.
- Marge.

1293
01:50:01,191 --> 01:50:04,237
Good morning.
Unusual weather.

1294
01:50:04,320 --> 01:50:07,198
- Very.
- And you, sir. Any better?

1295
01:50:07,240 --> 01:50:10,368
Pretty good.
Sticking with hot water.

1296
01:50:10,451 --> 01:50:12,745
- Where's Mr. MacCarron?
- San Remo.

1297
01:50:12,828 --> 01:50:15,582
The police are amateurs.

1298
01:50:15,624 --> 01:50:20,170
Well, my boy, it's come
to a pretty pass, hasn't it?

1299
01:50:20,254 --> 01:50:23,423
What is the detective
hoping to find in San Remo?

1300
01:50:23,507 --> 01:50:28,344
He's being thorough.
I'm learning about my son, Tom.

1301
01:50:28,428 --> 01:50:31,849
Now he's missing,
I'm learning a great deal about him,

1302
01:50:31,932 --> 01:50:35,019
and I hope that you can
fill in some more blanks for me.

1303
01:50:35,102 --> 01:50:38,146
Marge has been good enough
to do that about Mongibello.

1304
01:50:38,230 --> 01:50:42,025
I'll try my best, sir. Obviously,
I'll do anything to help Dickie.

1305
01:50:42,109 --> 01:50:44,569
Good. This theory,

1306
01:50:44,653 --> 01:50:46,781
the letter
he left for you.

1307
01:50:46,864 --> 01:50:50,117
The police think that's
a clear indication...

1308
01:50:50,201 --> 01:50:53,954
he was planning on doing something,
uh, to himself.

1309
01:50:53,996 --> 01:50:56,791
I just don't believe that.

1310
01:50:56,875 --> 01:50:59,419
You don't want to, dear.

1311
01:51:02,630 --> 01:51:04,633
I'd like
to talk to Tom alone.

1312
01:51:04,715 --> 01:51:07,510
Perhaps this afternoon.
Would you mind?

1313
01:51:09,971 --> 01:51:13,975
Marge, what a man may say
to his sweetheart...

1314
01:51:14,059 --> 01:51:16,227
and what he'll admit
to another fellow...

1315
01:51:19,523 --> 01:51:22,234
Such as?

1316
01:51:25,946 --> 01:51:29,200
What a waste of lives and opportunities.

1317
01:51:29,283 --> 01:51:32,285
I'd pay that fellow a hundred dollars
right now to shut up!

1318
01:51:40,628 --> 01:51:44,006
No, Marge doesn't
know the half of it.

1319
01:51:44,047 --> 01:51:47,343
And his passport photo.

1320
01:51:47,385 --> 01:51:50,264
Did you hear? To scratch out
his own face like that?

1321
01:51:50,388 --> 01:51:52,516
Can you imagine?

1322
01:51:52,599 --> 01:51:55,852
Frame of mind
you'd have to be in?

1323
01:51:55,936 --> 01:51:59,230
"I've thought about going to the police,
but I can't face it.

1324
01:51:59,314 --> 01:52:02,859
I can't face
anything anymore."

1325
01:52:02,901 --> 01:52:06,238
I feel guilty. I feel
like I pushed him away.

1326
01:52:06,321 --> 01:52:08,365
I feel like I spoke
and he heard you.

1327
01:52:08,449 --> 01:52:11,243
Well,

1328
01:52:11,326 --> 01:52:13,912
if we all pushed him away,
what about him pushing us away?

1329
01:52:13,995 --> 01:52:16,582
You've been a great friend
to my son.

1330
01:52:16,665 --> 01:52:19,794
Everything is
someone else's fault.

1331
01:52:19,877 --> 01:52:22,337
We all want to sow
wild oats,

1332
01:52:22,421 --> 01:52:25,716
but somebody's got to...
got to...

1333
01:52:25,799 --> 01:52:28,594
What is the word?

1334
01:52:28,678 --> 01:52:31,888
You know, the moment
someone confronts him,

1335
01:52:33,266 --> 01:52:35,768
he lashes out.

1336
01:52:35,852 --> 01:52:38,396
He always has.

1337
01:52:38,479 --> 01:52:42,358
You know, people always say
that you can't choose your parents,

1338
01:52:47,113 --> 01:52:49,575
but you can't choose
your children.

1339
01:52:50,950 --> 01:52:54,537
Dickie.

1340
01:52:54,621 --> 01:52:58,208
You can be a leech.
You can be quite boring.

1341
01:52:58,291 --> 01:53:00,210
- Stop it!
- It's boring.

1342
01:53:04,297 --> 01:53:06,633
Stop, stop, stop!

1343
01:53:08,134 --> 01:53:10,054
- Stop, stop, stop!
- Tommy, Tommy.

1344
01:53:10,138 --> 01:53:12,056
Like a little girl.

1345
01:53:12,139 --> 01:53:15,225
Like a little girl.

1346
01:53:18,854 --> 01:53:20,815
Coming.

1347
01:53:20,899 --> 01:53:23,276
- Sorry. I was asleep.
- Finally.

1348
01:53:23,317 --> 01:53:25,444
- I must have fallen asleep.
- Did Dickie's dad go?

1349
01:53:25,527 --> 01:53:27,488
You look ghastly, Tom.
Did you have a nightmare?

1350
01:53:27,530 --> 01:53:30,741
- He's having an early night.
- Oh, poor man.

1351
01:53:30,824 --> 01:53:33,285
You know, we were banging
on that door forever.

1352
01:53:36,873 --> 01:53:38,833
Uh-oh.

1353
01:53:38,875 --> 01:53:42,462
- I think I've broken a strap.
- Not guilty.

1354
01:53:42,545 --> 01:53:45,506
I'll fix some drinks.

1355
01:53:45,590 --> 01:53:48,218
Ah!
You walk in Venice.

1356
01:53:49,761 --> 01:53:51,679
Are you okay?

1357
01:53:53,182 --> 01:53:55,017
I'm fine.

1358
01:53:55,100 --> 01:53:59,271
- Did you want me to stick around?
- No, it's okay.

1359
01:54:01,314 --> 01:54:03,483
I could come back.

1360
01:54:18,832 --> 01:54:20,960
Your key.

1361
01:54:24,672 --> 01:54:27,342
Tom?

1362
01:54:27,425 --> 01:54:30,929
Marge, I'm in the bath.
I won't be long.

1363
01:54:31,012 --> 01:54:33,222
Tom, I have to speak to you.
It's urgent.

1364
01:54:36,976 --> 01:54:38,895
Coming.

1365
01:54:50,407 --> 01:54:53,702
- I found Dickie's rings.
- What?

1366
01:54:53,785 --> 01:54:55,787
You have Dickie's rings.

1367
01:55:00,584 --> 01:55:02,503
I can explain.

1368
01:55:02,586 --> 01:55:05,255
Dickie promised me he would
Never take off this ring.

1369
01:55:05,339 --> 01:55:08,384
Let me put some clothes on
and we'll talk about this.

1370
01:55:08,468 --> 01:55:10,887
- I have to tell Mr. Greenleaf.
- Marge, you're being hysterical.

1371
01:55:10,970 --> 01:55:14,432
He promised me, "I swear, I will never
take off this ring until we get..."

1372
01:55:14,515 --> 01:55:16,433
Shut up!

1373
01:55:18,645 --> 01:55:22,106
I'm wet, Marge.
I've lost my towel.

1374
01:55:22,190 --> 01:55:25,193
And I'd really like
to put some clothes on.

1375
01:55:25,276 --> 01:55:27,278
Go and pour us both a drink.

1376
01:55:30,699 --> 01:55:32,617
Pour us a drink.

1377
01:56:05,984 --> 01:56:08,320
Marge?

1378
01:56:08,404 --> 01:56:10,656
Where are you going?

1379
01:56:10,739 --> 01:56:14,202
I wasn't snooping.
I just...

1380
01:56:14,285 --> 01:56:17,205
I was looking for a needle
and thread to mend my bra.

1381
01:56:19,207 --> 01:56:22,793
That scent you're wearing.

1382
01:56:22,877 --> 01:56:26,131
I bought that
For you.

1383
01:56:26,172 --> 01:56:28,758
The thing about Dickie...

1384
01:56:28,842 --> 01:56:30,761
So many things.

1385
01:56:32,679 --> 01:56:36,266
That day when he was late
coming back from Rome,

1386
01:56:36,349 --> 01:56:38,267
I tried to tell you this.

1387
01:56:38,351 --> 01:56:41,814
He was with another girl.
I'm not talking about Meredith, either.

1388
01:56:41,897 --> 01:56:45,150
Another girl
that we met in a bar.

1389
01:56:45,192 --> 01:56:48,278
He couldn't be faithful
For five minutes.

1390
01:56:48,362 --> 01:56:50,364
So when he makes a promise,

1391
01:56:50,448 --> 01:56:52,491
it doesn't mean what it means
when you make a promise...

1392
01:56:52,574 --> 01:56:55,161
or I make a promise.

1393
01:56:55,203 --> 01:56:59,206
He has so many realities, Dickie,
and he believes them all.

1394
01:56:59,289 --> 01:57:02,502
He lies. He lies.

1395
01:57:02,543 --> 01:57:06,965
And that's his-Half the time
he doesn't even realize he's doing it.

1396
01:57:07,048 --> 01:57:10,342
And today,

1397
01:57:10,384 --> 01:57:14,180
I really started wondering whether
he may have killed Freddie.

1398
01:57:14,264 --> 01:57:17,851
He would get so crazy
If anybody would contradict him.

1399
01:57:17,934 --> 01:57:20,645
Well, you know that.
You know that.

1400
01:57:20,728 --> 01:57:23,357
You know that.

1401
01:57:23,399 --> 01:57:25,692
And that's the irony, Marge.

1402
01:57:25,733 --> 01:57:27,695
I loved you.

1403
01:57:27,736 --> 01:57:29,696
You may as well know, Marge.
I loved you.

1404
01:57:29,738 --> 01:57:32,491
I don't know, maybe it's
grotesque of me to say this now,

1405
01:57:32,573 --> 01:57:35,368
so just... write it on apiece
of paper or something...

1406
01:57:35,452 --> 01:57:37,912
and put it in your purse
for a rainy day.

1407
01:57:37,997 --> 01:57:42,208
"Tom loves me. Tom loves me."

1408
01:57:42,292 --> 01:57:44,670
- Why do you have Dickie's rings?
- I told you.

1409
01:57:44,753 --> 01:57:47,840
- He gave them to me.
- Why? When?

1410
01:57:47,923 --> 01:57:50,926
I feel as if you haven't been listening
to anything I've been saying to you.

1411
01:57:51,009 --> 01:57:54,263
I don't believe you.
I don't believe you.

1412
01:57:54,347 --> 01:57:56,682
- It's all true.
- I don't believe...

1413
01:57:56,766 --> 01:58:01,145
a single word you've said.

1414
01:58:01,229 --> 01:58:03,940
You're shivering, Marge.
Look at you.

1415
01:58:04,023 --> 01:58:07,819
Marge, can I hold you?

1416
01:58:07,902 --> 01:58:09,862
Will you let me hold you?

1417
01:58:09,945 --> 01:58:11,990
Marge?

1418
01:58:12,115 --> 01:58:15,159
- Peter! Thank God you're here.
- What's going on?

1419
01:58:15,243 --> 01:58:18,579
Get me out of here.
Get me out of here. Please!

1420
01:58:18,663 --> 01:58:23,501
Tom, are you okay?

1421
01:58:23,543 --> 01:58:26,672
You try.
You try talking to her.

1422
01:58:27,756 --> 01:58:29,841
- Tom?
- I give up.

1423
01:58:29,924 --> 01:58:32,511
Tell me what's going on.
Tom!

1424
01:58:32,594 --> 01:58:35,055
- What did I ever do to her?
- Listen...

1425
01:58:35,138 --> 01:58:38,267
Have her tell you one thing
that I've ever done to her.

1426
01:58:38,351 --> 01:58:41,019
You can't be angry
with her.

1427
01:58:41,102 --> 01:58:44,064
She's confused, and she needs
someone to blame.

1428
01:58:44,106 --> 01:58:46,066
So she blames you.

1429
01:58:46,108 --> 01:58:48,694
I'll go back home
and talk to her.

1430
01:58:48,736 --> 01:58:51,238
As for you,

1431
01:58:51,322 --> 01:58:53,950
either get a safety razor
or grow a beard.

1432
01:59:06,963 --> 01:59:10,133
- Is Mr. Greenleaf here?
- Mr. Ripley?

1433
01:59:10,217 --> 01:59:12,886
- Yes.
- I'm Alvin MacCarron.

1434
01:59:15,597 --> 01:59:18,266
I don't know,
I don't know. I just know it.

1435
01:59:18,349 --> 01:59:21,270
Marge, there's female
intuition and then there are facts.

1436
01:59:23,855 --> 01:59:25,775
- Tom.
- Sir.

1437
01:59:25,858 --> 01:59:28,569
Marge, you should have waited.
I didn't...

1438
01:59:28,652 --> 01:59:31,321
Didn't Peter say I'd
come by and pick you up?

1439
01:59:32,448 --> 01:59:35,075
Marge has been telling us
about the rings.

1440
01:59:35,117 --> 01:59:37,620
Yes, I feel ridiculous
I didn't mention them yesterday.

1441
01:59:37,703 --> 01:59:40,122
I clean forgot.
Ridiculous.

1442
01:59:42,708 --> 01:59:47,005
Perhaps you didn't mention them because
there's only one conclusion to be drawn.

1443
01:59:49,090 --> 01:59:52,343
I'm going to take Marge for a walk.
Tom, Mr. MacCarron needs to talk to you.

1444
01:59:52,427 --> 01:59:54,637
There's no need. We could go
to the bar. There's no need.

1445
01:59:54,720 --> 01:59:56,930
No, no.

1446
01:59:56,972 --> 01:59:59,267
I think you should
stay here.

1447
02:00:21,123 --> 02:00:23,584
I could probably
see my room from here.

1448
02:00:23,666 --> 02:00:25,628
I can see my house.

1449
02:00:27,630 --> 02:00:31,759
When you see where you live from a
distance, it's like a dream, isn't it?

1450
02:00:31,842 --> 02:00:34,094
I don't care for B.S.

1451
02:00:34,178 --> 02:00:36,806
I don't care to hear it.
I don't care to speak it.

1452
02:00:39,016 --> 02:00:41,311
- Okay.
- Did you know that at Princeton...

1453
02:00:41,352 --> 02:00:43,688
Dickie Greenleaf
half-killed a boy?

1454
02:00:44,771 --> 02:00:46,774
At a party over some girl.

1455
02:00:46,858 --> 02:00:50,736
Kicked the kid several times
in the head, put him in the hospital.

1456
02:00:50,820 --> 02:00:54,657
Boy had a wire fixed in his jaw,
lost some hearing.

1457
02:00:54,699 --> 02:00:57,994
Why do you think Dickie's father
sent him to Europe in the first place?

1458
02:01:00,705 --> 02:01:04,917
The Rome police didn't think
to ask Mr. Greenleaf.

1459
02:01:05,001 --> 02:01:07,963
Nor did they think to check
on whether a Thomas Ripley...

1460
02:01:08,046 --> 02:01:11,216
had ever been a student
at Princeton University.

1461
02:01:11,300 --> 02:01:15,929
Oh, I turned up
a Tom Ripley...

1462
02:01:16,013 --> 02:01:20,100
who had been a piano tuner
in the music department.

1463
02:01:21,184 --> 02:01:23,270
You see, in America,

1464
02:01:23,354 --> 02:01:27,857
we are taught to check a fact
before it becomes a fact.

1465
02:01:27,941 --> 02:01:30,361
We're taught to nose around.

1466
02:01:30,402 --> 02:01:33,280
When a girl drowns herself,

1467
02:01:33,363 --> 02:01:35,742
find out if
that girl is pregnant.

1468
02:01:35,825 --> 02:01:38,744
Find out if Dickie
Had an embarrassment there.

1469
02:01:40,163 --> 02:01:43,540
Mr. Greenleaf appreciates your loyalty.
He really does.

1470
02:01:43,582 --> 02:01:46,669
Marge...
She has a hundred theories.

1471
02:01:46,753 --> 02:01:49,672
There are a few things
that she doesn't know.

1472
02:01:49,756 --> 02:01:51,716
We hope she never knows.

1473
02:01:51,800 --> 02:01:54,052
I hope she never knows.

1474
02:01:54,093 --> 02:01:56,597
Three different people...

1475
02:01:56,680 --> 02:02:00,224
saw Dickie
get into Freddie's car.

1476
02:02:00,308 --> 02:02:03,604
One man,
who will not testify...

1477
02:02:03,687 --> 02:02:06,606
because he was jumping somebody
else's wife at the time,

1478
02:02:06,690 --> 02:02:10,694
saw Dickie removing license plates
from a red sports car.

1479
02:02:10,777 --> 02:02:14,740
The police know about this man because
he happens to be a policeman.

1480
02:02:16,783 --> 02:02:20,245
I found these in the basement
of Dickie's apartment.

1481
02:02:20,328 --> 02:02:22,414
They belong to Freddie's car.

1482
02:02:22,498 --> 02:02:26,794
Mr. Greenleaf has asked me...

1483
02:02:26,876 --> 02:02:29,755
to lose these in the canal
this evening.

1484
02:02:34,969 --> 02:02:37,805
Mr. Greenleaf feels that
there was a silent promise...

1485
02:02:37,889 --> 02:02:41,058
in Dickie's letter to you
which he intends to honor.

1486
02:02:41,142 --> 02:02:43,687
He also intends to transfer
A good portion...

1487
02:02:43,770 --> 02:02:48,482
of Dickie's income from his trust
into your name.

1488
02:02:48,566 --> 02:02:50,652
He does not intend...

1489
02:02:50,735 --> 02:02:54,197
to give the Italians any
information about Dickie's past.

1490
02:02:56,158 --> 02:02:59,954
He's rather hoping that...
you will feel the same.

1491
02:03:18,013 --> 02:03:19,931
- Thank you so much, Tom.
- Sir.

1492
02:03:20,015 --> 02:03:21,934
Good-bye.

1493
02:03:26,564 --> 02:03:30,859
Marge, I feel I never should have said
those things to you the other evening.

1494
02:03:30,943 --> 02:03:34,948
I was pretty flustered,
and the rings... And you looked so...

1495
02:03:35,031 --> 02:03:37,326
I don't know.

1496
02:03:37,368 --> 02:03:41,454
But I hope that note goes
in your purse to New York...

1497
02:03:41,538 --> 02:03:43,999
for a rainy day.

1498
02:03:45,542 --> 02:03:49,254
- What are you gonna do now, Tom?
- I don't know.

1499
02:03:49,337 --> 02:03:51,464
Peter has a concert in Athens
next month,

1500
02:03:51,547 --> 02:03:54,134
so he asked me to come along
and help out.

1501
02:03:56,720 --> 02:03:58,638
He says good-bye.

1502
02:03:58,722 --> 02:04:00,682
By the way, he was
in rehearsal so he couldn't...

1503
02:04:00,724 --> 02:04:04,938
Why do I think there's
never been a Ripley rainy day?

1504
02:04:05,020 --> 02:04:07,606
What?

1505
02:04:07,689 --> 02:04:11,402
I know it was you.
I know it was you.

1506
02:04:11,486 --> 02:04:14,321
I know it was you!
I know it was you!

1507
02:04:14,404 --> 02:04:18,034
- Marge, Marge. Please!
- I know you killed Dickie!

1508
02:04:18,117 --> 02:04:20,035
- Marge!
- I know! No!

1509
02:04:20,119 --> 02:04:23,622
I know it was you!

1510
02:04:23,706 --> 02:04:25,708
Marge.
Marge, please.

1511
02:04:25,792 --> 02:04:28,461
It's not Tom.
Really.

1512
02:04:37,053 --> 02:04:40,306
We are called gondoleri

1513
02:04:40,390 --> 02:04:44,352
But that's a vagary
It's quite honorary

1514
02:04:44,561 --> 02:04:49,816
The trade that we ply

1515
02:04:49,942 --> 02:04:52,695
Ask me what I want to change
about this moment.

1516
02:04:52,779 --> 02:04:55,238
I don't know. What do you want
to change about this moment?

1517
02:04:55,280 --> 02:04:56,990
Nothing.

1518
02:05:00,661 --> 02:05:03,456
I'm freezing. Coming down?

1519
02:05:03,539 --> 02:05:06,375
Later. I want
to catch the sunset.

1520
02:05:06,459 --> 02:05:10,713
- You're mad.
- I am.

1521
02:05:20,640 --> 02:05:22,558
Dickie?

1522
02:05:25,770 --> 02:05:27,688
Dickie?

1523
02:05:31,109 --> 02:05:33,028
Dickie!

1524
02:05:44,122 --> 02:05:46,041
Oh, my God.

1525
02:05:48,001 --> 02:05:49,961
Hello, Meredith.

1526
02:05:53,090 --> 02:05:55,425
I was looking at you.

1527
02:05:55,509 --> 02:05:58,930
Your clothes.
I wouldn't have known you.

1528
02:05:59,013 --> 02:06:01,765
Well, you spotted me,
So you get the reward.

1529
02:06:03,435 --> 02:06:06,103
- What?
- Just kidding.

1530
02:06:06,186 --> 02:06:10,149
- Are you alone?
- Oh.

1531
02:06:10,191 --> 02:06:13,236
Hardly.
Couldn't be less alone.

1532
02:06:13,319 --> 02:06:15,988
- Aunt Joan.
- And "co."

1533
02:06:19,117 --> 02:06:21,077
A lot of "co."

1534
02:06:22,203 --> 02:06:25,332
Oh, God.

1535
02:06:25,415 --> 02:06:28,501
You know, seeing you again, I...

1536
02:06:30,587 --> 02:06:33,881
I've thought about you...

1537
02:06:33,923 --> 02:06:35,884
so much.

1538
02:06:35,926 --> 02:06:37,885
And I've thought about you.

1539
02:06:39,931 --> 02:06:43,391
Yeah, well, when I've thought about you,
I was mostly hating you.

1540
02:06:49,981 --> 02:06:51,942
Where have you been hiding?

1541
02:06:52,026 --> 02:06:55,529
I haven't been hiding.

1542
02:06:55,612 --> 02:06:57,949
I've been in police custody.

1543
02:06:59,283 --> 02:07:02,245
They've been trying to
flush out Freddie's killer.

1544
02:07:02,287 --> 02:07:05,497
- You're kidding.
- They're giving me this vacation,

1545
02:07:05,581 --> 02:07:07,875
which is why
the getup.

1546
02:07:07,917 --> 02:07:10,085
Which is why
you haven't heard from me.

1547
02:07:10,169 --> 02:07:12,463
You know, the whole world
thinks you killed Freddie.

1548
02:07:12,547 --> 02:07:15,633
- Oh! It's terrible.
- I know.

1549
02:07:15,717 --> 02:07:18,428
Listen, I can't
talk now. Um, later?

1550
02:07:22,390 --> 02:07:25,768
Later? Later?

1551
02:07:35,988 --> 02:07:37,947
So...

1552
02:07:43,203 --> 02:07:45,873
Are you traveling under "R"?

1553
02:07:45,957 --> 02:07:49,000
You know what? I am.

1554
02:07:52,088 --> 02:07:56,467
Dickie, are you with Peter
Smith-Kingsley? I bet you are.

1555
02:07:56,509 --> 02:07:59,136
My aunt
thought she saw him.

1556
02:07:59,220 --> 02:08:01,347
Peter Smith-Kingsley?
No, I...

1557
02:08:01,431 --> 02:08:05,059
I haven't seen him
in months.

1558
02:08:05,142 --> 02:08:07,061
No, I'm alone.

1559
02:08:26,832 --> 02:08:28,792
Hi.

1560
02:08:31,503 --> 02:08:34,006
- How was it?
- It was good.

1561
02:08:34,090 --> 02:08:36,008
But I'll tell you something.

1562
02:08:36,091 --> 02:08:39,845
I want us to stay in here
for the rest of the trip.

1563
02:08:44,392 --> 02:08:47,144
Was that Meredith?

1564
02:08:48,646 --> 02:08:50,564
Was who Meredith?

1565
02:08:50,648 --> 02:08:54,361
Meredith Logue. You were kissing
someone. It looked like Meredith.

1566
02:09:01,076 --> 02:09:04,579
I came out to find you.

1567
02:09:04,663 --> 02:09:07,081
Oh, hardly kissing.

1568
02:09:08,499 --> 02:09:11,628
- Kissing off.
- It didn't look that way.

1569
02:09:13,129 --> 02:09:15,174
You know?
From a distance?

1570
02:09:20,136 --> 02:09:22,806
I lied... to her.

1571
02:09:24,057 --> 02:09:26,685
She thought she'd seen you.

1572
02:09:26,727 --> 02:09:28,687
Why lie?

1573
02:09:28,729 --> 02:09:33,692
Dickie and Peter
together. That's just too good gossip.

1574
02:09:33,734 --> 02:09:35,694
Or Tom and Peter, even.

1575
02:09:35,736 --> 02:09:38,280
That would be
even better gossip.

1576
02:09:38,364 --> 02:09:40,615
Really? Why?

1577
02:09:45,454 --> 02:09:49,917
I... I, um...
I'm completely lost.

1578
02:09:52,586 --> 02:09:54,505
I know.

1579
02:09:55,799 --> 02:09:58,927
I'm sorry, Peter.

1580
02:09:59,010 --> 02:10:00,970
I'm lost.

1581
02:10:04,099 --> 02:10:07,477
I'm gonna be stuck
in the basement, aren't I?

1582
02:10:07,561 --> 02:10:10,856
Aren't I?

1583
02:10:10,939 --> 02:10:12,857
That's my...

1584
02:10:15,944 --> 02:10:17,904
Terrible...

1585
02:10:19,238 --> 02:10:21,325
and alone...

1586
02:10:21,409 --> 02:10:24,829
and dark.

1587
02:10:24,912 --> 02:10:27,623
And I've lied...

1588
02:10:27,665 --> 02:10:30,751
about who I am...

1589
02:10:30,834 --> 02:10:32,836
and where I am.

1590
02:10:32,919 --> 02:10:35,422
Now no one'll ever find me.

1591
02:10:37,008 --> 02:10:39,343
What do you mean,
lied about who you are?

1592
02:10:39,427 --> 02:10:42,096
I always thought
it'd be better...

1593
02:10:42,138 --> 02:10:45,266
to be a fake somebody...

1594
02:10:45,307 --> 02:10:48,269
than a real nobody.

1595
02:10:48,311 --> 02:10:51,188
What are you talking about?
You're not a nobody.

1596
02:10:51,271 --> 02:10:53,775
That's the last thing
you are.

1597
02:11:01,199 --> 02:11:04,786
Peter.

1598
02:11:04,827 --> 02:11:07,413
Tell me some good things
about Tom Ripley.

1599
02:11:09,291 --> 02:11:11,918
No, don't get up.
Don't get up. Don't get up.

1600
02:11:14,880 --> 02:11:16,798
Just...

1601
02:11:19,593 --> 02:11:23,346
Just tell me some nice things...
about Tom Ripley.

1602
02:11:26,433 --> 02:11:29,521
"Good things
about Tom Ripley".

1603
02:11:31,439 --> 02:11:33,649
That could take me
some time.

1604
02:11:36,194 --> 02:11:40,073
Tom is talented.
Tom is tender.

1605
02:11:41,449 --> 02:11:43,451
Tom is beautiful.

1606
02:11:43,493 --> 02:11:45,953
You're such a liar.

1607
02:11:49,248 --> 02:11:52,628
Tom is...
Tom is a mystery.

1608
02:11:58,216 --> 02:12:00,760
Tom is not a nobody.

1609
02:12:04,389 --> 02:12:08,269
Tom has secrets
he doesn't want to tell me,

1610
02:12:08,310 --> 02:12:10,688
and I wish he would.

1611
02:12:14,859 --> 02:12:17,319
Tom has nightmares.

1612
02:12:21,365 --> 02:12:23,826
That's not a good thing.

1613
02:12:28,415 --> 02:12:31,000
Tom has someone to love him.

1614
02:12:32,585 --> 02:12:35,004
That is a good thing.

1615
02:12:37,840 --> 02:12:42,303
Mmm.
Tom is crushing me.

1616
02:12:42,387 --> 02:12:45,765
Tom is crushing me.

1617
02:12:45,849 --> 02:12:49,687
Tom. Tom, you're crush...

1618
02:12:49,728 --> 02:12:52,647
Oh, God!

1619
02:12:52,689 --> 02:12:54,565
Oh, God!

1620
02:12:54,649 --> 02:12:56,568
Oh, God!

1621
02:13:03,742 --> 02:13:06,203
Oh, God! Peter.
