Well, I'm sleeping with you

188
00:12:51,190 --> 00:12:54,063
Come on, don't you see other women

189
00:12:54,193 --> 00:12:55,164
Are there doing the day

190
00:12:55,294 --> 00:12:57,196
And think about what it
would be have sex with them?

191
00:12:57,366 --> 00:12:58,297
I don't want talk...

192
00:12:58,437 --> 00:13:00,470
You like girl just like pussy

193
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:02,041
What?

194
00:13:02,171 --> 00:13:03,743
What did you doing?

195
00:13:07,207 --> 00:13:08,979
So they must try it

196
00:13:09,079 --> 00:13:10,911
Just for a little while and...

197
00:13:11,181 --> 00:13:12,382
We can stop anytime

198
00:13:12,512 --> 00:13:13,784
Are we stop now?

199
00:13:13,914 --> 00:13:15,115
How are we going to talk about it?

200
00:13:15,285 --> 00:13:16,587
I don't want to

201
00:13:16,687 --> 00:13:18,659
I can't handle that although I know...

202
00:13:18,819 --> 00:13:20,891
I know what you can handle it

203
00:13:21,492 --> 00:13:23,264
Yeah

204
00:13:27,999 --> 00:13:31,773
Ed, come on, Ed

205
00:13:31,903 --> 00:13:34,305
If we can be mature and honest and open

206
00:13:34,476 --> 00:13:35,477
It can work

207
00:13:35,537 --> 00:13:36,638
Are you?

208
00:13:37,409 --> 00:13:39,281
It can work?

209
00:13:39,441 --> 00:13:42,114
These way show of rational to you,Alice

210
00:13:42,284 --> 00:13:44,386
But I don't want you
sleeping with other man

211
00:13:44,486 --> 00:13:46,649
Ed, is just sex, it doesn't
have to mean anything

212
00:13:46,789 --> 00:13:49,051
In fact the hold point
in there meaningless

213
00:13:49,191 --> 00:13:50,793
It's not about love at all

214
00:13:50,923 --> 00:13:52,825
I know that I love you

215
00:13:52,925 --> 00:13:53,756
It just meaning that...

216
00:13:55,558 --> 00:13:57,931
Want to get marry and then, that is

217
00:13:58,131 --> 00:13:59,562
Is forever

218
00:13:59,733 --> 00:14:02,535
You're not jealous when l going
have sex with another women?

219
00:14:02,636 --> 00:14:03,607
You're not?

220
00:14:03,807 --> 00:14:04,307
No

221
00:14:04,468 --> 00:14:05,268
Okay

222
00:14:05,409 --> 00:14:06,610
Cause I know you love
me so I can handle it

223
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:07,571
You can handle it?

224
00:14:07,671 --> 00:14:08,512
What about me?

225
00:14:08,642 --> 00:14:09,343
I can't handle it

226
00:14:09,473 --> 00:14:11,375
With the mental picture when
you have sex with some guy

227
00:14:11,545 --> 00:14:12,376
I can't handle it, Alice

228
00:14:12,546 --> 00:14:13,147
Yes, you can handle it

229
00:14:13,317 --> 00:14:14,418
-I just told you I can't
-Yes, you can

230
00:14:14,578 --> 00:14:15,379
-I can't
-You can

231
00:14:15,549 --> 00:14:17,521
I can't!

232
00:14:19,083 --> 00:14:22,156
We can't stop each other
from experience in life

233
00:14:22,427 --> 00:14:24,589
And the thing is we did

234
00:14:24,759 --> 00:14:26,691
Well, you know what

235
00:14:27,392 --> 00:14:28,263
How you know what?

236
00:14:28,393 --> 00:14:30,195
Because we haven't have
sex in almost 3 week

237
00:14:30,335 --> 00:14:34,600
And we haven't had sex at
daytime in almost 3 year

238
00:14:35,801 --> 00:14:37,242
I see...

239
00:14:37,443 --> 00:14:40,306
But these isn't made any
different from any other else

240
00:14:40,576 --> 00:14:42,278
Well...

241
00:14:46,883 --> 00:14:48,915
Allright, so you always use condom?

242
00:14:49,215 --> 00:14:50,286
And never in the house

243
00:14:50,486 --> 00:14:51,658
You don't bring anyone into this house

244
00:14:51,818 --> 00:14:53,860
What about video can I make video?

245
00:14:54,621 --> 00:14:56,923
And we have to completely
honest with each other

246
00:14:57,123 --> 00:14:58,725
Because we don't want
anyone coming between us

247
00:14:58,895 --> 00:15:01,999
Except the people we are
going to have sex with?

248
00:15:06,373 --> 00:15:08,936
Okay, you may list who after it

249
00:15:09,136 --> 00:15:10,207

These list is a work of someone

258
00:15:26,555 --> 00:15:27,896
They cannot deal

259
00:15:28,026 --> 00:15:30,629

We think that we should had an
anniversarian for acknowledge

621
00:35:07,850 --> 00:35:08,851
An anniversarian?

622
00:35:08,981 --> 00:35:10,913
Why? because there are
having too much fun?

623
00:35:11,013 --> 00:35:11,754
Stop

624
00:35:11,884 --> 00:35:12,985
They think they having fun

625
00:35:13,186 --> 00:35:14,958
They don't really see what happening

626
00:35:15,088 --> 00:35:16,820
And they drifting apart

627
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:19,522
Is acknowledge time for other people

628
00:35:19,693 --> 00:35:21,224

629
00:35:21,464 --> 00:35:23,096

630
00:35:23,296 --> 00:35:25,269

631
00:35:25,469 --> 00:35:30,174
And Alice, she spent all her time
with the contractor from Kelvin job

632
00:35:30,304 --> 00:35:31,775

00:35:39,984 --> 00:35:41,716
Nice laugh

634
00:35:42,917 --> 00:35:45,090
We're not go to standby and watch

636
00:35:49,094 --> 00:35:51,156
Their relationship is mental last

637
00:35:51,326 --> 00:35:54,460

638
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:55,561
That's right

639
00:35:55,701 --> 00:35:57,062
Sweety, I don't mean to be an asshole

640
00:35:57,202 --> 00:35:59,665

643
00:36:02,608 --> 00:36:03,940

644
00:36:04,470 --> 00:36:05,942
I said yes

645
00:36:06,072 --> 00:36:08,545
But you, they haven't
fuck around over there

646
00:36:15,322 --> 00:36:17,484
Can I go now, Carl?

647
00:36:31,869 --> 00:36:32,800

648
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:34,242

Now I think I like to
move you up at something

655
00:36:48,957 --> 00:36:50,259
Which is a little bit more expensive

656
00:36:50,389 --> 00:36:52,121
We keep you much fully dynamic

657
00:36:52,291 --> 00:36:54,023
You know, high and low

658
00:36:54,323 --> 00:36:57,326

659
00:36:57,527 --> 00:36:59,869

00:37:17,648 --> 00:37:18,949
Kitchen... what did you think?

664
00:37:19,049 --> 00:37:20,991
What is that had to do with anything?

665
00:37:21,092 --> 00:37:23,694
You know, I just, l...

666
00:37:24,095 --> 00:37:26,928
I don't think I need
such an expensive stereo

667
00:37:27,058 --> 00:37:28,059
I'm just...

668
00:37:28,159 --> 00:37:29,160
Of course you don't

669
00:37:29,300 --> 00:37:30,331

00:39:01,258 --> 00:39:03,460
What do you have to
hang these picture up

685
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:08,406
Don't you think that kind
of bring a love down a bit?

686
00:39:10,067 --> 00:39:11,839
Yeah

687
00:39:15,143 --> 00:39:18,777

00:40:52,516 --> 00:40:55,349
But I just think she
could be no more adventure

713

Are you sure?

720
00:41:13,569 --> 00:41:14,800

727
00:41:27,914 --> 00:41:28,915

00:42:34,455 --> 00:42:36,026
You had them with a goddamm relationship

754
00:42:36,226 --> 00:42:38,389
Don't you think l wanna

755
00:42:38,629 --> 00:42:40,691

00:42:46,267 --> 00:42:49,170
Because is really impossible to seeing
with other people I living together

760
00:42:49,300 --> 00:42:50,972
You know, it made thing really difficult

761
00:42:51,142 --> 00:42:54,075
Oh, my god, I'm really

Is anything else I can do that
going made you like more comfortable?

00:43:56,672 --> 00:43:58,514
So now Donald call me 50 times a day

779
00:43:58,644 --> 00:43:59,615
And everytime when I went on computer

780
00:43:59,775 --> 00:44:01,347

781
00:44:01,477 --> 00:44:04,120
I thought that you had sex
with several different people

782
00:44:04,280 --> 00:44:05,421

783
00:44:05,521 --> 00:44:07,283

I don't know

785
00:44:08,184 --> 00:44:10,957
I don't think you can have sex
with a lot of people you want, Alice

786
00:44:11,087 --> 00:44:13,430
Maybe you could only
had sex with one person

787
00:44:13,530 --> 00:44:16,693
It was Ed, no Donald

788
00:44:16,833 --> 00:44:18,495
But I had to make it into double digit

789
00:44:18,595 --> 00:44:20,868
This is my last chance to be a slave

790
00:44:22,539 --> 00:44:25,573

00:47:42,882 --> 00:47:45,555
I didn't live in that

845
00:47:45,655 --> 00:47:47,717
3 weeks everybody knows things for crazy

846
00:47:47,918 --> 00:47:48,759
You wanna know why?

847
00:47:48,919 --> 00:47:52,723
Because we are fucking crazy doing this

00:47:55,566 --> 00:47:59,070
Hey Alice, you wanna answer yourself...

849
00:48:00,101 --> 00:48:04,035
Sitting here with a glass of wine...

850
00:48:05,737 --> 00:48:07,909
Listening the gal's music, this guy?

851
00:48:13,245 --> 00:48:14,486

853
00:48:18,150 --> 00:48:20,257
Ed, Alice's fiance

854
00:48:20,292 --> 00:48:24,627
The guy she just got on hot sex with

855
00:48:25,728 --> 00:48:27,700
He doesn't wanna talk to me

856
00:48:27,960 --> 00:48:30,533
Donald it isn't really a good time, ok

857
00:48:30,763 --> 00:48:33,406
See, Ed, this is exactly
why we can't stop rite now

858
00:48:33,566 --> 00:48:34,767
I already slept with Donald...

859
00:48:34,938 --> 00:48:36,239
And I can't only sleep with Donald

860
00:48:36,339 --> 00:48:37,711
So that I can be wild

861
00:48:41,775 --> 00:48:43,347
Ed, come on it's easier for you

862
00:48:43,447 --> 00:48:44,177
I need to get away from Donald

863
00:48:45,018 --> 00:48:45,869
You've lots of meaningless sex

864
00:48:45,904 --> 00:48:46,720
Yes, that's the whole point...

865
00:48:46,850 --> 00:48:51,585
It's meaningless I can't
stand it so meaningless

866
00:48:59,964 --> 00:49:05,800

867
00:50:07,636 --> 00:50:10,109

What's up?

869
00:50:16,876 --> 00:50:18,378
I've found something on the bed

870
00:50:18,648 --> 00:50:20,420

871
00:50:22,252 --> 00:50:24,754
She said she rite the

Once busted Juddie up

874
00:50:40,101 --> 00:50:44,145
I really thought she has
something to do, Ed...

00:50:52,254 --> 00:50:53,715
Come on, man

00:50:53,855 --> 00:50:55,557

Now it's so... someone dumpped you

That wasn't squeezed

888
00:51:30,754 --> 00:51:34,298
I specifically asked for juice
squeezed on the small machine

889

I need a squeeze fresh, that
means rite now on the small machine

890
00:51:40,665 --> 00:51:41,636
Doesn't come from a bottle..

891
00:51:41,736 --> 00:51:42,567
Doesn't come from a can...

892
00:51:42,707 --> 00:51:44,069
Doesn't come from a my container...

893
00:51:44,209 --> 00:51:46,511
Comes from my fucking fruits
the orange things in the kitchen

894
00:51:46,641 --> 00:51:48,513
Lou, it isn't a bid deal
-Ed, it's a big deal!

895
00:51:51,046 --> 00:51:54,019
Infact, can you get it off of

It's ok, we got a lot of
horrible assholes in here

00:52:15,072 --> 00:52:17,204

903
00:52:23,681 --> 00:52:25,252

904
00:52:28,185 --> 00:52:30,958
No, I mean really sad

906
00:52:39,327 --> 00:52:41,970

917
00:53:20,211 --> 00:53:21,142
Hey I like the egg

No more seconds anymore for the rest

923
00:53:46,068 --> 00:53:48,105
Your mum had a tough time

924
00:53:48,140 --> 00:53:51,274
Maybe that's because
you snore every nite

925
00:53:54,948 --> 00:53:57,110
I'm gonna go eat that egg

926
00:54:00,053 --> 00:54:02,916
I can't believe she once
gets rid of these plantings...

927
00:54:03,016 --> 00:54:04,658
I mean they are so beautiful

928
00:54:04,958 --> 00:54:08,062
She wants to devalue the
house for to divorce someone

929
00:54:08,692 --> 00:54:11,295
But then the plants
are caught in the middle

930
00:54:15,299 --> 00:54:17,932
He is so needy, he's suffocating!

931
00:54:21,476 --> 00:54:23,608
Donald! -Alice

932
00:54:26,481 --> 00:54:28,543
I don't know I'll be meeting you

933
00:54:28,714 --> 00:54:30,515
So I guess this is just a coincidence

934
00:54:31,887 --> 00:54:33,348
Donny

935
00:54:34,390 --> 00:54:38,654
I've something for you, and
I know you're gonna like it

936
00:54:42,428 --> 00:54:44,430
I talk to you later

937
00:54:47,463 --> 00:54:51,037
I guess he's a little
needy than you thought

938
00:54:51,368 --> 00:54:53,840
You sleep 3 other women besides me?

939
00:54:54,040 --> 00:54:59,246
Iove women, Alice's going
thru a very difficult time rite

940
00:54:59,346 --> 00:55:02,019
She's a very sexy woman...

941
00:55:02,479 --> 00:55:04,021
I can't believe this

942
00:55:04,281 --> 00:55:06,053
Hey you are engaged

943
00:55:06,153 --> 00:55:07,955
Yes, and you know I'm engaged...

944
00:55:08,125 --> 00:55:10,057
I didn't know that
you're seeing other people

945
00:55:10,188 --> 00:55:12,660
I didn't think you care, you
didn't even stay over my house

946
00:55:12,860 --> 00:55:15,433
You can't get 1 of these
women stay over your house?

947
00:55:15,593 --> 00:55:17,235
Sometimes, but...

948
00:55:17,435 --> 00:55:19,297
I don't like sleep in a loney nite

949
00:55:19,437 --> 00:55:22,140
My god you are so needy

950
00:55:22,270 --> 00:55:23,772
And for some reason
I'm feeling jealous...

951
00:55:23,942 --> 00:55:27,276
I mean this is actually crazy, I don't
even like you but I'm feeling jealous

952
00:55:27,406 --> 00:55:28,347
Really? you jealous?

953
00:55:28,447 --> 00:55:30,174
I'm suppose to be of
having adventures...

954
00:55:30,209 --> 00:55:34,253
But I'm sucked with this guy who bugs
me and he sneaking around behind my back

955
00:55:34,413 --> 00:55:36,686
Look, if you're asking
for a commitment...

956
00:55:36,886 --> 00:55:37,917
I don't know if I'm ready

957
00:55:38,087 --> 00:55:39,719
I'm not asking for commitment, Donald...

958
00:55:39,889 --> 00:55:41,691
I'm breaking up with you, ok?

959
00:55:41,791 --> 00:55:45,125
I'm breaking up wityh
whatever this is that we have

960
00:55:49,599 --> 00:55:52,833
Don't do this to me

961
00:55:56,477 --> 00:55:58,709
Can I ask you something about
you taking it the wrong way

962
00:55:58,879 --> 00:56:00,241
I hope so

963
00:56:00,741 --> 00:56:03,745
Isn't that kind of strange
what you and fiancee are doing?

964
00:56:03,915 --> 00:56:06,588
Come on anything else, I
don't wanna talk about that

965
00:56:07,949 --> 00:56:10,051
But you're getting married

966
00:56:10,191 --> 00:56:11,993
No, I'm afraid...

967
00:56:13,495 --> 00:56:15,197
Is that bothering you?

968
00:56:16,328 --> 00:56:18,060
No

969
00:56:23,506 --> 00:56:26,939
I'm sorry, somebody've to
take you out of your misery

970
00:56:27,069 --> 00:56:28,110
No

971
00:56:28,371 --> 00:56:29,912
You're doing it

972
00:56:30,113 --> 00:56:32,045
Ok, let's go again

973
00:56:35,278 --> 00:56:40,183
Hey, I'm gonna start making this
cake if we gonna have it by dessert...

974
00:56:40,323 --> 00:56:44,628
Some old ladies said it was gonna
really cute when I was buying cake flower

975
00:56:50,394 --> 00:56:52,166
It's from Jake

976
00:56:55,299 --> 00:56:56,441
"Dear Penelope..."

977
00:56:56,571 --> 00:56:59,674
"I'm sorry to say I can't
spend Jake's birthday with you"

978
00:56:59,874 --> 00:57:02,907
"I've met someone else and head
over heels in love with her"

979
00:57:03,108 --> 00:57:04,980
"Sincerely, Carl"

980
00:57:10,886 --> 00:57:13,459
Why weren't you be so sad?

981
00:57:15,621 --> 00:57:20,927
I think it's a bad idea for us
to be seeing each other every nite

982
00:57:23,699 --> 00:57:25,832
But I love you

983
00:57:26,633 --> 00:57:28,605
You do?

984
00:57:31,207 --> 00:57:33,480
I love you too

985
00:57:36,413 --> 00:57:39,046
Jake, can I talk to you?

986
00:57:42,920 --> 00:57:44,752
I saw that note that you wrote

987
00:57:44,952 --> 00:57:47,154
My mum showed it to you?

988
00:57:50,598 --> 00:57:53,461
Your mum is sad because
you don't like me

989
00:57:54,032 --> 00:57:56,364
I understand why you don't like me

990
00:57:56,434 --> 00:57:59,467
I was a little older than you
when my parents got divorced

991
00:57:59,608 --> 00:58:00,669
For good?

992
00:58:00,909 --> 00:58:02,871
For good?

993
00:58:03,342 --> 00:58:05,974
Yeah, I think they divorced for good

994
00:58:06,145 --> 00:58:09,378
Because people sometimes
get back togather?

995
00:58:10,219 --> 00:58:12,351
Not usually

996
00:58:12,722 --> 00:58:15,384
Pretty much never

997
00:58:20,890 --> 00:58:24,634
When my parents split
up I went into my room...

998
00:58:24,965 --> 00:58:28,498
And I tried to learn everything
I could about baseball

999
00:58:28,638 --> 00:58:31,371
I memorise the baseball in encyclopedia

1000
00:58:31,642 --> 00:58:33,073
No way

1001
00:58:33,243 --> 00:58:34,645
Yes way

1002
00:58:34,805 --> 00:58:38,409
How many consecutive
games did junior play?

1003
00:58:38,609 --> 00:58:41,712
3632 -That is

1004
00:58:41,913 --> 00:58:44,716
Who hit the most famous
from the Federal League?

1005
00:58:45,286 --> 00:58:48,219
"Dutch Welling 33"

1006
00:58:48,620 --> 00:58:51,493
You know about the Federal League?

1007
00:58:52,694 --> 00:58:54,566
He knows everything

1008
00:58:54,726 --> 00:58:57,900
Who is the longest "head's
check" over 2 seasons?

1009
00:58:59,972 --> 00:59:08,981
That would be John Cecerius?
Sept 3rd, 1924-April, 28th 1925

1010
00:59:09,442 --> 00:59:11,414
35 games

1011
00:59:11,714 --> 00:59:13,116
Wrong

1012
00:59:14,317 --> 00:59:16,319
What?

1013
00:59:16,489 --> 00:59:17,651
Come on, let me...

1014
00:59:17,791 --> 00:59:20,994
Ok...ok..it was rite

1015
00:59:28,202 --> 00:59:30,204
He's another guy

1016
00:59:32,006 --> 00:59:34,308
You know Ed amd I bearly
talk to last 6 weeks...

1017
00:59:36,110 --> 00:59:37,271
Now I'm scared to call him now

1018
00:59:37,472 --> 00:59:38,573
I'm having an affair

1019
00:59:38,743 --> 00:59:39,774
What?

1020
00:59:39,974 --> 00:59:41,246
What? you don't wanna talk?

1021
00:59:41,416 --> 00:59:43,378
A secret affair?

1022
00:59:43,878 --> 00:59:45,080
The usual kind

1023
00:59:45,250 --> 00:59:46,051
With whom?

1024
00:59:46,181 --> 00:59:46,982
No one you know

1025
00:59:47,122 --> 00:59:49,284
It's fabulous -What fabulous?

1026
00:59:50,285 --> 00:59:52,528
We use tomatoes that
Alice grew in her garden

1027
00:59:53,088 --> 00:59:56,031
They are quite sweet you should try

1028
01:00:04,771 --> 01:00:06,242
My Godm you are rite

1029
01:00:06,372 --> 01:00:08,575
Jesus, it's just a tomatoes

1030
01:00:12,409 --> 01:00:15,782
The water is perfect I recommend to swim

1031
01:00:15,882 --> 01:00:17,314
This is just what I need

1032
01:00:17,414 --> 01:00:19,116
Can I borrow your suit? -Yeah

1033
01:00:23,921 --> 01:00:26,163
No, thank you

1034
01:00:42,210 --> 01:00:43,612
Peter

1035
01:00:47,686 --> 01:00:48,787
I want you so badly

1036
01:00:48,948 --> 01:00:52,421
I can't do this to
Claire, No, Peter! Peter!

1037
01:00:52,551 --> 01:00:54,293
Claire doesn't care

1038
01:00:55,454 --> 01:00:57,557
Alice, be the bad gal...

1039
01:00:57,727 --> 01:00:59,529
Be the bad gal with me

1040
01:00:59,629 --> 01:01:01,161
No, Peter...no...

1041
01:01:10,611 --> 01:01:14,144
Sandy got a friend from college
they wanna have a 3-way with me

1042
01:01:14,345 --> 01:01:15,516
You kidding me

1043
01:01:15,616 --> 01:01:17,618
This is a freak game, she's totally hot

1044
01:01:17,778 --> 01:01:21,282
Till I saw her picture ever, she was
naked running on her garden or something

1045
01:01:21,482 --> 01:01:24,325
Buddy, nice! you just
getting better and better

1046
01:01:27,258 --> 01:01:28,660
Hello?

1047
01:01:28,860 --> 01:01:30,362
Alice...

1048
01:01:30,892 --> 01:01:32,464
What are you doing?

1049
01:01:33,465 --> 01:01:36,138
I'm at loose, are you ok?

1050
01:01:37,139 --> 01:01:39,301
I'm on my way, yeah

1051
01:01:39,441 --> 01:01:40,402
I'm sorry

1052
01:01:40,542 --> 01:01:41,904
I've to go

1053
01:01:47,280 --> 01:01:49,512
I always knew Peter had a thing for you

1054
01:01:49,652 --> 01:01:50,613
I knew it

1055
01:01:50,753 --> 01:01:52,886
I'm so cripes out, I didn't leave

1056
01:01:53,086 --> 01:01:57,390
I know you didn't, you
just think yourself...

1057
01:01:57,691 --> 01:01:59,593
What a cripes!

1058
01:02:00,193 --> 01:02:02,466
You know what, Ed, I
wanna stop this now...

1059
01:02:02,501 --> 01:02:04,568
I want you to come home

1060
01:02:05,669 --> 01:02:07,771
Really? -Ya

1061
01:02:07,901 --> 01:02:12,406
I thought the deal was, we see
other people until we get married

1062
01:02:12,536 --> 01:02:14,078
I know, Ed...

1063
01:02:14,679 --> 01:02:19,844
When I got a week had sex with other
people to maintain our relationship...

1064
01:02:22,417 --> 01:02:25,720
I mean it isn't enough time and day
there isn't enough motional ways...

1065
01:02:25,851 --> 01:02:27,953
This is ridiculous

1066
01:02:29,855 --> 01:02:33,328
I think we should stick to
the original agreement, sweety

1067
01:02:37,002 --> 01:02:40,236
I'm really weary about,
what's happening with us

1068
01:02:40,506 --> 01:02:41,737
What's happening with us? we are fine...

1069
01:02:41,908 --> 01:02:46,743
We sell out the couch
togather, this is nice

1070
01:02:47,914 --> 01:02:49,376
You're seeing someone?

1071
01:02:49,546 --> 01:02:51,348
I'm seeing other people,
that's what you want us to do...

1072
01:02:51,478 --> 01:02:52,849
That was your idea, that
we seeing other people...

1073
01:02:52,979 --> 01:02:53,720
This is what I'm doing

1074
01:02:53,850 --> 01:02:55,522
Rite, now I wanna stop

1075
01:02:55,652 --> 01:02:57,384
I don't think it's fair that you...

1076
01:02:57,624 --> 01:03:01,188
Tell me to stop just because
there's a break up of you with Donald

1077
01:03:01,859 --> 01:03:05,292
So what's her name, Ed -Who?

1078
01:03:05,433 --> 01:03:07,094
Your gal friend

1079
01:03:07,495 --> 01:03:09,367
My gal friend?

1080
01:03:09,597 --> 01:03:11,970
What's her name?

1081
01:03:12,100 --> 01:03:15,173
Sandy, she isn't my gal friend at all

1082
01:03:15,303 --> 01:03:16,675
That's what I like about ours

1083
01:03:16,805 --> 01:03:19,007
Well, I'm telling you that
we need to stop this now!

1084
01:03:19,177 --> 01:03:21,209
I don't think it's fair at all,
you get to stop everything...

1085
01:03:21,380 --> 01:03:23,352
Whatever you want to... do you?

1086
01:03:23,482 --> 01:03:24,383
So leave!

1087
01:03:24,513 --> 01:03:26,355
Leave? -Yes, get out!

1088
01:03:26,515 --> 01:03:28,387
No! I'm not leaving

1089
01:03:28,557 --> 01:03:31,791
Why you sitiing while you
could be having fun with Sandy?

1090
01:03:33,292 --> 01:03:36,526
I don't know why I'm here either...

1091
01:03:36,696 --> 01:03:38,528
Because I rather be with Sandy

1092
01:03:39,098 --> 01:03:41,030
Great!

1093
01:04:28,981 --> 01:04:32,255
Do you wanna go and spy
Ed's new gal friend with me?

1094
01:04:33,526 --> 01:04:35,889
Hell, yeah

1095
01:04:43,066 --> 01:04:45,339
I just want an objective opinion

1096
01:04:50,444 --> 01:04:52,076
Hey come out yet?

1097
01:04:52,777 --> 01:04:54,148
No

1098
01:04:56,180 --> 01:04:58,583
That's 1 ugly shirt

1099
01:05:00,455 --> 01:05:02,317
The kid made it for me

1100
01:05:02,557 --> 01:05:04,920
I washed it but it was so "bleed"

1101
01:05:06,461 --> 01:05:08,694
Hey I got some good news

1102
01:05:09,224 --> 01:05:11,467
Penelope's pregnant, we'll get married

1103
01:05:12,027 --> 01:05:13,399
Oh my God

1104
01:05:14,430 --> 01:05:16,472
Nice! -Thanks

1105
01:05:17,833 --> 01:05:21,007
How pregnant is she? -18 days

1106
01:05:21,377 --> 01:05:22,108
It isn't coming

1107
01:05:22,308 --> 01:05:23,980
18 days is different from pregnant

1108
01:05:24,811 --> 01:05:27,614
Well, it's pregnant for us

1109
01:05:30,587 --> 01:05:33,220
I can't believe you
gonna have a kid before

1110
01:05:34,321 --> 01:05:36,323
I get on a band wagon

1111
01:05:36,753 --> 01:05:39,727
You know, Sandy is
nice, but she's no Alice

1112
01:05:39,927 --> 01:05:42,229
You and Alice was really good

1113
01:05:43,100 --> 01:05:45,563
I think you getting greedy

1114
01:05:49,507 --> 01:05:52,370
Sandy's got a friend from college...

1115
01:05:53,211 --> 01:05:55,674
Tonite I'll have a 3-way

1116
01:05:56,715 --> 01:05:58,877
Really?

1117
01:06:01,680 --> 01:06:03,352
Oh, look at this

1118
01:06:06,255 --> 01:06:09,388
Oh man, you can't compare with that

1119
01:06:09,859 --> 01:06:11,360
He's back in college

1120
01:06:11,530 --> 01:06:14,133
She doesn't want promises,
she doesn't want answers

1121
01:06:14,494 --> 01:06:16,996
She just want sleep and fuck

1122
01:06:18,438 --> 01:06:19,899
You've stoned

1123
01:06:20,069 --> 01:06:22,472
Yeah but stone of clarity

1124
01:06:26,676 --> 01:06:28,548
Let's get out of here

1125
01:06:29,610 --> 01:06:32,683
I'll get the car, you return the clubs

1126
01:06:53,935 --> 01:06:55,477
Alice, what are you doing here?

1127
01:06:56,338 --> 01:06:57,980
I'm talking to Ed

1128
01:06:58,540 --> 01:07:01,043
You just wanna sleep, eat and fuck

1129
01:07:01,243 --> 01:07:02,414
She says "fuck"

1130
01:07:02,785 --> 01:07:03,746
Come on sweety let's go and play

1131
01:07:05,247 --> 01:07:07,550
Alice, you gotta settle down
-Don't..don't..tell me to settle down

1132
01:07:07,820 --> 01:07:10,593
Don't touch me you asshole!

1133
01:07:11,024 --> 01:07:12,896
Looks like somebody couldn't
handle seeing other people

1134
01:07:12,996 --> 01:07:15,028
Don't push me, Ed, ok

1135
01:07:15,198 --> 01:07:16,760
No! Ed,! don't!

1136
01:07:17,831 --> 01:07:19,062
Don't put the show
on, Alice -Stop it, Ed

1137
01:07:19,202 --> 01:07:20,764
What're you doing, hit me?

1138
01:07:20,934 --> 01:07:23,367
Stop it! -Fuck!

1139
01:07:23,707 --> 01:07:25,069
Both of them say "Fuck"

1140
01:07:25,209 --> 01:07:27,171
Come on, let's get
some ice-cream, I'll buy

1141
01:07:27,371 --> 01:07:28,472
Can I have Cuppocino?

1142
01:07:28,672 --> 01:07:30,344
You can have whatever you want

1143
01:07:30,544 --> 01:07:32,446
It was nice seeing you, Alice

1144
01:07:33,548 --> 01:07:36,120
I can't take this anymore

1145
01:07:36,220 --> 01:07:39,784
If you don't stop now, it's over!

1146
01:07:40,084 --> 01:07:45,931
Honestly, Alice, I didn't
even know how I feel anymore

1147
01:07:46,531 --> 01:07:48,463
I don't know

1148
01:07:54,740 --> 01:07:56,742
You don't wanna be with me anymore?

1149
01:08:02,909 --> 01:08:04,150
What?

1150
01:08:04,851 --> 01:08:06,913
You don't wanna be with me anymore?

1151
01:08:07,013 --> 01:08:10,116
I don;t know, I feel...

1152
01:08:14,021 --> 01:08:15,993
Are we...are we breaking up?

1153
01:08:16,293 --> 01:08:18,265
I think we already had

1154
01:08:26,274 --> 01:08:28,376
So chronic!

1155
01:08:29,036 --> 01:08:33,681
You and Ed so happy, you
completely destroyed it...

1156
01:08:33,812 --> 01:08:37,045
You know, Peter and l
bearly seen each and other...

1157
01:08:37,215 --> 01:08:38,947
Things still dragging

1158
01:08:39,988 --> 01:08:42,120
So ironic

1159
01:08:43,352 --> 01:08:45,053
I mean you don't even
got to be a bad gal

1160
01:08:45,154 --> 01:08:47,756
You don't even got to be #5

1161
01:08:48,157 --> 01:08:51,931
Oh, sweety, honey...

1162
01:09:00,069 --> 01:09:03,543
5 years I was with her, 5 years
I was gonna married that gal

1163
01:09:03,743 --> 01:09:05,515
And then she attacks me with
the golf club in the arm...

1164
01:09:05,715 --> 01:09:08,879
Infront of the freaking children or less

1165
01:09:09,079 --> 01:09:12,823
You know, tonite maybe isn't a
good nite for the 3-way with Miranda

1166
01:09:12,923 --> 01:09:14,024
I disagree with it

1167
01:09:14,154 --> 01:09:15,656
It's gonna be ok, I really do

1168
01:09:15,856 --> 01:09:16,287
Are you sure?

1169
01:09:25,266 --> 01:09:27,198
So how do you guys know each and other

1170
01:09:31,573 --> 01:09:33,044
We went to Harvard together

1171
01:09:33,175 --> 01:09:34,246
You went to Harvard?

1172
01:09:35,047 --> 01:09:36,448
Yeah

1173
01:09:37,149 --> 01:09:38,310
You are a writer?

1174
01:09:38,410 --> 01:09:41,153
Sort of TV

1175
01:09:41,313 --> 01:09:42,755
You know David Gallagher?

1176
01:09:49,122 --> 01:09:51,094
I know David

1177
01:10:13,047 --> 01:10:15,690
We go to this castle, none'll see us

1178
01:10:35,040 --> 01:10:37,213
Let's fuck -Yes

1179
01:10:40,847 --> 01:10:42,178
What's that?

1180
01:10:42,378 --> 01:10:44,751
What do you think? -How do I know

1181
01:10:46,853 --> 01:10:50,457
No, while you're fucking
Sandy, I'll be fucking you!

1182
01:10:50,857 --> 01:10:52,959
No...!

1183
01:10:56,393 --> 01:10:58,395
You aren't sticking up
into my ass, no way! no!

1184
01:10:58,565 --> 01:11:00,367
But it's ok if you
stick your dick up my ass

1185
01:11:00,537 --> 01:11:01,163
What are you talking about?

1186
01:11:01,198 --> 01:11:03,541
This is 5 times the size of
any cock that I've ever seen

1187
01:11:03,701 --> 01:11:05,403
I thought you'll open it wide

1188
01:11:06,944 --> 01:11:09,107
Open enough to screw up your fiancee

1189
01:11:09,247 --> 01:11:12,210
But not open enough for
exploration of sexuality

1190
01:11:12,310 --> 01:11:15,553
I don't see how you putting a dildo
on my ass is a true exploration...

1191
01:11:15,754 --> 01:11:16,785
Of my sexuality?

1192
01:11:16,955 --> 01:11:18,917
You are so goddam suburban

1193
01:11:19,057 --> 01:11:21,360
Mess the sex stuff looking
like a porn video...

1194
01:11:21,490 --> 01:11:24,663
And be queer on hyper sense
of missionary position dogma

1195
01:11:24,823 --> 01:11:25,794
What are you talking about?

1196
01:11:25,924 --> 01:11:26,825
What is she talking about?

1197
01:11:26,966 --> 01:11:31,430
I'm trying to redefine "Morban"
psycho-sexual dynamic that exists...

1198
01:11:31,630 --> 01:11:34,103
Only the show up of
coupling gender identity

1199
01:11:34,233 --> 01:11:36,776
If you just wanna fuck
then get someone else

1200
01:11:37,377 --> 01:11:39,108
We're gonna get someone else

1201
01:11:42,042 --> 01:11:44,484
Fucking asshole!

1202
01:11:49,049 --> 01:11:51,952
Yeah, sure that's cool too

1203
01:11:52,092 --> 01:11:55,296
Really? I don't know it

1204
01:12:00,331 --> 01:12:03,034
Do you know why I need gals?

1205
01:12:03,564 --> 01:12:07,208
There's a slad, I don't
know what was in it

1206
01:12:09,170 --> 01:12:11,773
Let's go to mine I
think I'm gonna throw up

1207
01:12:17,249 --> 01:12:18,580
Have you ever smoked crank?

1208
01:12:18,851 --> 01:12:22,054
No...no

1209
01:12:22,324 --> 01:12:24,857
I think it's the nite we
connect with some cranks

1210
01:12:27,160 --> 01:12:29,132
Togather?

1211
01:12:35,298 --> 01:12:36,269
Do you know where you are going?

1212
01:12:36,439 --> 01:12:37,901
Yeah

1213
01:12:38,141 --> 01:12:39,903
How often you smoke crank?

1214
01:12:40,043 --> 01:12:41,605
Not the often

1215
01:12:45,079 --> 01:12:46,250
You know what I changed my mind...

1216
01:12:46,350 --> 01:12:47,551
I don't wanna do this anymore

1217
01:12:47,711 --> 01:12:49,383
Come on, Ed, we already, we'll be fine

1218
01:12:49,513 --> 01:12:51,085
How often you smoke crank?

1219
01:12:51,355 --> 01:12:52,987
You know what, I'm afraid about you

1220
01:12:53,157 --> 01:12:54,288
You're fucking square!

1221
01:12:54,489 --> 01:12:55,720
I'm not fucking square!

1222
01:12:55,860 --> 01:12:57,922
I think you are fucking crank-head

1223
01:12:58,062 --> 01:12:59,023
What is the big deal?

1224
01:12:59,194 --> 01:13:01,496
Druggies live everywhere!

1225
01:13:11,076 --> 01:13:12,438
I understand

1226
01:13:13,008 --> 01:13:14,410
You understand what?

1227
01:13:17,613 --> 01:13:19,345
What did you understand?

1228
01:13:19,415 --> 01:13:22,088
I'm sick on this, I'm
sick on all these bullshit!

1229
01:13:25,421 --> 01:13:28,655
My sister is such a crank!

1230
01:13:29,055 --> 01:13:31,398
Get your bitch under control, dude

1231
01:13:33,430 --> 01:13:35,903
Let's go home, please

1232
01:13:38,265 --> 01:13:40,137
I wanna have some fun

1233
01:13:46,844 --> 01:13:48,876
Do you want to put on a condom?

1234
01:13:49,247 --> 01:13:51,349
I think it would be hot

1235
01:13:51,579 --> 01:13:53,321
If that's what you want

1236
01:14:13,042 --> 01:14:15,405
Forget about it -Peter! I'm opening it!

1237
01:14:16,075 --> 01:14:18,308
Ok -I've got it

1238
01:14:25,515 --> 01:14:27,057
You know what...

1239
01:14:27,357 --> 01:14:30,991
As hard as I try to be a used up
peace mood, it just doesn't work

1240
01:14:31,592 --> 01:14:34,064
I'm a relationship person

1241
01:14:47,278 --> 01:14:49,240
How about the blow job?

1242
01:14:58,350 --> 01:15:00,322
Crap

1243
01:15:09,432 --> 01:15:11,234
She'll divorce me and take all the money

1244
01:15:35,229 --> 01:15:36,731
Here it is

1245
01:15:39,994 --> 01:15:41,266
Where the fuck you've been?

1246
01:15:42,467 --> 01:15:44,039
Who the fuck is this?

1247
01:15:46,271 --> 01:15:47,502
I've been fucking trying
to call you all week

1248
01:15:47,602 --> 01:15:48,503
I've been busy

1249
01:15:48,604 --> 01:15:51,707
So you never heard a thing call a
phone I bug the fucking thing for you

1250
01:15:51,877 --> 01:15:53,248
This crank got your phone?

1251
01:15:53,379 --> 01:15:54,650
I'm not a cranker asshole...

1252
01:15:54,750 --> 01:15:56,452
I'm her fucking boy
friend -Shut up, Ricky

1253
01:15:56,582 --> 01:16:00,716
Do you have any "Rock", yes or no?

1254
01:16:00,887 --> 01:16:03,319
I got a lot, here

1255
01:16:05,822 --> 01:16:07,824
Fucking crazy bitch!

1256
01:16:08,264 --> 01:16:09,726
Hey look, I'll pay for the crank

1257
01:16:10,126 --> 01:16:12,399
I'm gonna beat your ass you do the bitch

1258
01:16:33,121 --> 01:16:34,853
Are you out of your fucking mind?

1259
01:16:36,254 --> 01:16:37,556
This is so much fun!

1260
01:16:37,756 --> 01:16:39,758
I don't want any fucking fun!

1261
01:16:45,434 --> 01:16:47,266
Let's go to bedroom and fuck

1262
01:16:49,168 --> 01:16:51,140
I want you fuck me on
the table rite there

1263
01:17:05,385 --> 01:17:07,357
Jesus fucking Christ!

1264
01:17:08,829 --> 01:17:10,961
What are you doing here?

1265
01:17:11,131 --> 01:17:12,493
I live here

1266
01:17:12,593 --> 01:17:15,566
Rite, but I thought you were
going to see "Sand Barbara"...

1267
01:17:15,766 --> 01:17:17,738
Well I changed my mind ok

1268
01:17:17,898 --> 01:17:21,302
This is who you having
the affair with? Lou?

1269
01:17:21,602 --> 01:17:22,974
Yeah

1270
01:17:23,745 --> 01:17:25,276
Then go to his house

1271
01:17:26,608 --> 01:17:29,080
I don't care, you guys gotta go

1272
01:17:29,711 --> 01:17:31,183
What the hell was that?

1273
01:17:33,785 --> 01:17:35,457
Alice?

1274
01:17:35,717 --> 01:17:38,320
Please leave! just get out of here!

1275
01:17:48,801 --> 01:17:52,135
You throw out my own cloths

1276
01:17:52,936 --> 01:17:56,079
"Sand Barbara", interesting

1277
01:18:01,445 --> 01:18:03,887
They ran away, none's been chasing us

1278
01:18:05,549 --> 01:18:06,850
Pull over, rite now!

1279
01:18:06,991 --> 01:18:10,624
I'm driving, it's my car,
I'm driving! pull over!

1280
01:18:18,733 --> 01:18:20,335
Shit!

1281
01:18:26,511 --> 01:18:27,673
I mean I'm really not shocked...

1282
01:18:27,843 --> 01:18:29,775
It always been obvious
that he has a thing for you

1283
01:18:29,945 --> 01:18:32,948
But what surprises me is that either
of you has the balls to go thru with it

1284
01:18:33,148 --> 01:18:35,981
So bloody I'm sick of you
always talking about balls

1285
01:18:36,182 --> 01:18:39,886
Congratulations Claire, you've
got biggest balls in all of us!

1286
01:18:40,256 --> 01:18:42,228
Nothing happened tonite

1287
01:18:42,388 --> 01:18:44,060
Obviously Alice, I mean you...

1288
01:18:44,260 --> 01:18:46,893
You are Alice, Alice doesn't
fuck her sister's husband

1289
01:18:47,033 --> 01:18:49,596
Look, I'm not trying to make excuses ok

1290
01:18:49,736 --> 01:18:51,198
But you are really insensitive...

1291
01:18:51,338 --> 01:18:54,301
In the car today I
just felt like fuck it!

1292
01:18:54,501 --> 01:18:55,372
Fuck what?

1293
01:18:55,542 --> 01:18:56,804
Fuck you!

1294
01:18:56,974 --> 01:19:00,007
Fuck you! fuck me and fuck everything!

1295
01:19:00,177 --> 01:19:03,751
I just wanted to feel... I
just wanted to feel worthless...

1296
01:19:03,911 --> 01:19:08,716
And degraded, and
repulsive and Peter called

1297
01:19:26,605 --> 01:19:28,677
They gonna harm her

1298
01:19:50,160 --> 01:19:51,932
I thought you were gay

1299
01:19:52,363 --> 01:19:58,369
Trying oral sex once when
I was 15 doesn't make me gay

1300
01:19:58,639 --> 01:20:01,612
I'm British -I knew, so you proud of it

1301
01:20:16,458 --> 01:20:18,590
Donald, what are you doing here?

1302
01:20:19,792 --> 01:20:22,364
You left this magazine at my house

1303
01:20:22,535 --> 01:20:25,368
And you've to bring it
back 5.30 in the morning?

1304
01:20:26,439 --> 01:20:28,441
You know, every time l
see it, it makes me sad

1305
01:20:28,641 --> 01:20:30,974
Well, throw it in the
recycling bin, Donald

1306
01:20:32,776 --> 01:20:35,649
Since I'm here as long
as it's no offensive...

1307
01:20:35,779 --> 01:20:38,351
I can't! No Donald!

1308
01:20:39,553 --> 01:20:42,786
You know, when you knocked on
the door I thought it was Ed

1309
01:20:42,886 --> 01:20:44,988
And I don't even know what would
I've been done if it was Ed...

1310
01:20:45,119 --> 01:20:47,922
Because I screwed everything up so badly

1311
01:20:51,295 --> 01:20:53,968
I don't realise you've all
these people in your house

1312
01:21:10,516 --> 01:21:12,888
I just wanna a little
bit of sex, you know

1313
01:21:13,048 --> 01:21:15,521
Is that...is that so terrible...

1314
01:21:17,053 --> 01:21:18,594
I don't mean to screw everything up

1315
01:21:18,794 --> 01:21:20,526
I don't mean to ruin everything...

1316
01:21:20,797 --> 01:21:24,731
You know when Ed and I were togather,
sometimes on Saturday nite...

1317
01:21:24,861 --> 01:21:29,636
We were just stay in and watch
movies and do our laundry...

1318
01:21:29,766 --> 01:21:35,112
And it sounds boring... but it was fun

1319
01:21:35,342 --> 01:21:37,574
It was nice and it was good!

1320
01:21:37,845 --> 01:21:40,748
That's why you 2 have to really
think about what you're doing...

1321
01:21:40,878 --> 01:21:43,781
Before you just throw
everything away you know?

1322
01:21:44,121 --> 01:21:49,787
Because it's really hard to find
same safe place in this world

1323
01:21:50,028 --> 01:21:55,894
Please stay on this Saturday
nite and do your laundry

1324
01:21:59,898 --> 01:22:02,471
We'll do our laundry

1325
01:22:07,706 --> 01:22:09,078
Rite

1326
01:22:25,465 --> 01:22:27,397
Car you rented to have an affair?

1327
01:22:27,527 --> 01:22:29,700
They didn't have any sedans

1328
01:22:31,602 --> 01:22:34,535
Assholes! you 2!

1329
01:23:27,661 --> 01:23:31,095
I've been carrying
this around for 3 weeks

1330
01:23:32,036 --> 01:23:35,340
