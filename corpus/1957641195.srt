[Ted] Section one reporting

10
00:02:23,133 --> 00:02:24,867
work finished,
Captain Beck, sir.

11
00:02:25,067 --> 00:02:27,700
Well done, Sergeant,
you've made excellent time.

12
00:02:27,833 --> 00:02:30,900
This'll be us falling out
for a smoke, then, sir?

13
00:02:31,067 --> 00:02:32,900
No, this'll be
you now, Sergeant,

14
00:02:33,067 --> 00:02:36,633
assisting sections two and
three to unload the hay.

15
00:02:36,767 --> 00:02:37,600
Fall in.

16
00:02:37,733 --> 00:02:39,100
Yes, Captain.

17
00:02:39,233 --> 00:02:42,767
The strong assist the weak
for the good of the company.

18
00:03:07,067 --> 00:03:07,900
[bell dings]

[engine rumbling]

22
00:03:29,433 --> 00:03:31,067
Good morning, Mr. Beck.

23
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,700
Good morning, ma'am.

24
00:03:32,833 --> 00:03:36,067
Great pleasure to see
you, Lady Frances.

25
00:03:37,067 --> 00:03:39,100
Please, no ceremony, Mr. Beck.

26
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:42,133
[Frank] Carry on, sergeant.

27
00:03:42,267 --> 00:03:43,267
Yes, sir.

28
00:03:44,433 --> 00:03:46,433
I stopped simply to
welcome you home.

29
00:03:47,867 --> 00:03:51,300
You've made fine soldiers
from our estate workers,

30
00:03:51,433 --> 00:03:53,267
but the men's military
training won't suffer

31
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,067
from their being called
back to Sandringham.

32
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:57,067
No, ma'am, test of their fitness

33
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:59,333
their willingness to work,
off the parade ground

34
00:03:59,467 --> 00:04:01,433
in Colchester and
straight into the fields,

35
00:04:01,567 --> 00:04:05,200
best company in training
and ready to serve abroad.

36
00:04:05,333 --> 00:04:07,667
I trust that everything's
in good order on the estate

37
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:10,133
and my brother gave
satisfaction in my job.

38
00:04:10,267 --> 00:04:14,100
Oh, yes, I have no complaints.

39
00:04:14,233 --> 00:04:16,767
My son no doubt will
speak to you tonight.

40
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:18,267
Tonight, ma'am?

41
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:22,400
Yes, you dine with us, Mr.
Beck, you and Mrs. Beck.

42
00:04:22,533 --> 00:04:26,067
She has the invitation,
a token of our gratitude.

43
00:04:26,867 --> 00:04:28,333
I shall be honoured, ma'am.

44
00:04:31,567 --> 00:04:34,333
[horse clopping]

45
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:38,500

[people socialising]

47
00:04:41,933 --> 00:04:43,533
[Soldier] Sir!

48
00:04:43,667 --> 00:04:46,833
Mr. Radley, you just
missed Lady Frances, sir.

49
00:04:46,967 --> 00:04:48,767
No matter, she can
wait another hour

50
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:52,833
to behold her fiance, in
uniform, if she pleases.

51
00:04:52,967 --> 00:04:55,067
[Frank] Congratulations,
you volunteered, sir?

52
00:04:55,133 --> 00:04:56,600
Shouldn't I call you sir?

53
00:04:56,733 --> 00:04:59,367
Surely a captain, even
in the Territorials,

54
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:01,333
outranks a mere subaltern?

55
00:05:01,467 --> 00:05:03,200
Force of habit, Mr. Radley.

56
00:05:03,333 --> 00:05:04,767
You're a guest of
the Royal Household.

57
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:06,667
And it's not as if
you're under orders,

58
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,867
though I'm afraid the men are,

59
00:05:09,067 --> 00:05:10,933
so if you're looking for a
groom, you'll have to wait

60
00:05:11,067 --> 00:05:13,400
until Private
Needham is released.

61
00:05:13,533 --> 00:05:15,133
My apologies.

62
00:05:15,267 --> 00:05:16,400
I'll ride again before dinner.

63
00:05:16,533 --> 00:05:17,533
Yes, sir.

64
00:05:20,067 --> 00:05:21,733
[Herbert] That's
five bob you owe me.

65
00:05:21,867 --> 00:05:23,200
[Will] How's that?

66
00:05:23,333 --> 00:05:25,700
Five bob, Mr. Beck'd see
off the Honourable Asshole.

67
00:05:25,833 --> 00:05:27,067
Oh, Radley's not that bad.

68
00:05:27,133 --> 00:05:27,933
[Herbert] [scoffs] Oh?

69
00:05:28,067 --> 00:05:30,067
Who'll have a cushy war, then?

70
00:05:30,133 --> 00:05:33,767
Herbert, why don't you put
a turd in your mouth, boy?

71
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:35,867
Oi, that'll do -!

72
00:05:36,067 --> 00:05:37,100
Sergeant don't like language

73
00:05:37,233 --> 00:05:38,867
now he's after our
Peggy, eh, Herbert?

74
00:05:39,067 --> 00:05:40,067
[Herbert laughs]

75
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:41,433
What, he after
your sister, Chad?

76
00:05:41,567 --> 00:05:43,067
We been away too long.

77
00:05:43,167 --> 00:05:45,067
She'll be off with
the dairyman, now,

78
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:46,600
him with the flat
feet what can't fight!

79
00:05:46,733 --> 00:05:49,333
[men laughing]

80
00:05:54,333 --> 00:05:59,333
- [dramatic orchestral music]
- [soldiers clomping]

81
00:06:26,933 --> 00:06:28,233
Right mad at you, sir!

82
00:06:28,367 --> 00:06:30,967
[men whooping]

83
00:06:32,733 --> 00:06:34,533
It's the Newcomer.

84
00:06:34,667 --> 00:06:36,067
Back from Mons, maybe?

85
00:06:37,067 --> 00:06:38,400
What's up with him?

86
00:06:38,533 --> 00:06:41,367
That's all we come home with,
we'll be laughing, eh, sir?

87
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:44,067
That's the spirit, Sergeant.

88
00:07:02,067 --> 00:07:03,300
[bird squawking]

89
00:07:03,433 --> 00:07:05,100
[Soldiers] Hooray!

90
00:07:12,767 --> 00:07:15,767
[children cheering]

91
00:07:26,533 --> 00:07:27,867
Company, halt!

92
00:07:32,367 --> 00:07:35,067
[Frank] Carry on, Sergeant.

93
00:07:35,133 --> 00:07:37,800
[Sergeant] Company, dismissed!

94
00:07:44,233 --> 00:07:47,300
[people socialising]

95
00:07:52,867 --> 00:07:54,067
[Arthur] So, Frank,
hope I didn't

96
00:07:54,167 --> 00:07:55,700
let you down with His Majesty.

97
00:07:55,833 --> 00:07:57,233
Grumble, did he?

98
00:07:57,367 --> 00:08:01,133
No, he has his ways, his
little shipshape ways.

99
00:08:01,267 --> 00:08:02,467
Oh, everything looks fine.

100
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:04,600
My boys give a good
account of themselves?

101
00:08:04,733 --> 00:08:06,100
Yes, as ever.

102
00:08:06,233 --> 00:08:08,633
Why Alec has signed up to
go abroad, I'll never know.

103
00:08:08,767 --> 00:08:10,500
You want to keep me
from the fun, Father?

104
00:08:10,633 --> 00:08:12,767
Ah, what business
have you got with fun?

105
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:14,067
Five little ones
and you and Joan

106
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:15,967
just starting out at Rolleston.

107
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:17,833
You did your stint in Africa.

108
00:08:17,967 --> 00:08:18,967
And never fired a shot.

109
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:20,133
[both laughing]

110
00:08:20,267 --> 00:08:21,300
That's young Evelyn,
egging him on.

111
00:08:21,433 --> 00:08:23,567
Alec shouldn't rise to him.

112
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:26,333
Arthur, you ought
to get the King

113
00:08:26,467 --> 00:08:28,833
to make you Court Worrier.

114
00:08:28,967 --> 00:08:31,467
Send in the Territorials
and the volunteers,

115
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:33,900
it will be over before
you can turn 'round.

116
00:08:38,067 --> 00:08:39,933
[weight clacks]

117
00:08:40,067 --> 00:08:43,467
10 stone, eight pounds, Beck.

118
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:44,900
Is that your regular weight?

119
00:08:45,067 --> 00:08:47,300
I'm a little lighter,
sir, after training.

120
00:08:47,433 --> 00:08:49,133
If you've not gained four pounds

121
00:08:49,267 --> 00:08:51,800
by midnight, you
may sue my cook.

122
00:08:51,933 --> 00:08:53,367
[all laughing]

123
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:55,867
Four pounds is the daily rate
for guests at Sandringham.

124
00:08:56,067 --> 00:08:58,733
Fatten them up and send
them home, that's my motto.

125
00:08:58,867 --> 00:09:00,133
Now, we move on.

126
00:09:00,267 --> 00:09:01,267
Yes, sir.

127
00:09:04,433 --> 00:09:06,667
- [people socialising]
- [cookware clattering]

128
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,367
What is it, Ted?

129
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:09,867
I can't stay.

130
00:09:10,067 --> 00:09:11,400
The Queen wants me fixing
her hair before dinner.

131
00:09:11,533 --> 00:09:14,133
Your half-day, Sunday,
meet me in Hunstanton.

132
00:09:14,267 --> 00:09:16,433
The lads are going
for a last jaunt.

133
00:09:16,567 --> 00:09:17,733
Meet you?

134
00:09:17,867 --> 00:09:18,967
I dunno, Ted.

135
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:20,067
[bell rings]

136
00:09:20,167 --> 00:09:21,300
Well, that's me, sorry.

137
00:09:22,967 --> 00:09:24,100
[Ted] Go on, meet me!

138
00:09:24,233 --> 00:09:25,967
Two o'clock bus, I'll be there.

139
00:09:34,533 --> 00:09:37,900
My dear mother simply
adores this house,

140
00:09:38,067 --> 00:09:39,733
which is why I choose to
give her the run of it

141
00:09:39,867 --> 00:09:43,433
while she lives and while
I camp out with the Queen

142
00:09:43,567 --> 00:09:45,433
and our family at York Cottage.

143
00:09:45,567 --> 00:09:47,367
A noble sacrifice, sir.

144
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:50,067
I rather enjoy the simple life.

145
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:52,433
And if my mother wishes
to spend more time there

146
00:09:52,567 --> 00:09:54,833
as she gets older,
then all to the good,

147
00:09:54,967 --> 00:09:58,333
though I confess I've worried
since our zeppelin scare.

148
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:03,600
Still, I know Beck will
guard her unto death.

149
00:10:03,733 --> 00:10:05,000
You're very kind, sir.

150
00:10:06,133 --> 00:10:07,867
Your brother's an
excellent chap, Beck,

151
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,600
but he's not a born land
agent, not nearly as quick

152
00:10:10,733 --> 00:10:13,000
as you to anticipate
one's needs.

153
00:10:13,133 --> 00:10:14,767
It's just a question
of practise, sir.

154
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:17,600
I'd say a question of instinct,

155
00:10:17,733 --> 00:10:21,867
but since you'll be here
anyway, it hardly matters.

156
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,767
I'll be here, surely not, sir?

157
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:25,267
I'm to go on active service.

158
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:28,333
We need efficiency at home
as well as in the field.

159
00:10:28,467 --> 00:10:31,667
And, really, you're
too old to fight, Beck.

160
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:33,133
You'll stay at Sandringham.

161
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:43,800
"I will give horses that
won glory with their speed."

162
00:10:43,933 --> 00:10:48,100
"Call no man poor in
booty or in precious gold,"

163
00:10:48,233 --> 00:10:50,900
"if he be given my
strong-footed horses."

164
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:53,200
[George] What's that,
Lieutenant Radley?

165
00:10:53,333 --> 00:10:55,467
The Iliad, sir.

166
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,667
It's back in fashion
amongst those of us

167
00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:00,400
about to prove ourselves
on the plains of Troy.

168
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:06,367
I'll give you a line,
"If I should die,"

169
00:11:07,567 --> 00:11:10,100
"think only this of me,
that there's some corner"

170
00:11:10,233 --> 00:11:13,900
"of a foreign field that
is forever England."

171
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:16,067
Now, there's a poem.

172
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:17,300
Do you know it?

173
00:11:17,433 --> 00:11:18,633
Of course, sir,
highly effective.

174
00:11:18,767 --> 00:11:20,833
Brings in recruits by the shoal.

175
00:11:20,967 --> 00:11:22,267
Though, personally, I'll stick

176
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:24,067
with the Greeks for inspiration.

177
00:11:24,933 --> 00:11:26,300
You, too, Captain Beck?

178
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:29,767
I'm afraid the
Greeks didn't appear

179
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:32,600
very often in my education, sir.

180
00:11:32,733 --> 00:11:33,600
Nor mine.

181
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:36,267
I'm afraid I let my mind wander

182
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:38,733
from the schoolroom
rather too often.

183
00:11:38,867 --> 00:11:39,933
Though not, I'm told, as often

184
00:11:40,067 --> 00:11:41,767
as my cousin Willi, the Kaiser.

185
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:43,067
[people chuckle]

186
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:45,700
Now, there he is dug
in all over Europe.

187
00:11:45,833 --> 00:11:48,633
And we must go up through Turkey
to keep our Russian friends

188
00:11:48,767 --> 00:11:51,133
supplied with the
means to fend him off.

189
00:11:53,533 --> 00:11:56,500
This will be your
second campaign, Doctor?

190
00:11:56,633 --> 00:11:58,600
Yes, sir, for my sins.

191
00:11:58,733 --> 00:12:01,833
I managed to help
put paid to the Boer.

192
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:06,400
What do we do, would you say,
to put paid to the Turks?

193
00:12:06,533 --> 00:12:10,700
Act quickly, sir, under
precise and detailed orders

194
00:12:10,833 --> 00:12:14,267
from a well-informed and
far-sighted High Command,

195
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:15,933
just as we did in South Africa.

196
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:20,933
I believe those conditions
can be guaranteed.

197
00:12:21,067 --> 00:12:23,633
[woman laughs]

198
00:12:25,133 --> 00:12:28,233
[people socialising]

199
00:12:31,767 --> 00:12:33,133
Why do you do it, Doctor?

200
00:12:34,067 --> 00:12:35,600
Why are you a lady-in-waiting?

201
00:12:37,067 --> 00:12:38,233
It is my occupation.

202
00:12:39,133 --> 00:12:40,300
Ditto, the drink.

203
00:12:43,467 --> 00:12:44,567
Alice has left me.

204
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:48,500
Officially, she's
sitting out the war

205
00:12:48,633 --> 00:12:50,233
with her parents in Sussex.

206
00:12:54,667 --> 00:12:57,667
When do you marry,
Lady Frances, hm?

207
00:12:59,433 --> 00:13:00,433
After the war.

208
00:13:02,633 --> 00:13:03,867
How sensible.

209
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:09,900
It's perfectly charming.

210
00:13:10,833 --> 00:13:13,167
You have such taste, Batterbee.

211
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:14,967
I'd scoop you up and
carry you off to London

212
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:17,333
if it wouldn't upset
my little French girl.

213
00:13:17,467 --> 00:13:18,700
I don't know as
I'd take to London,

214
00:13:18,833 --> 00:13:21,333
ma'am, or anywhere
outside Norfolk.

215
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:24,700
Your brothers will leave soon.

216
00:13:25,967 --> 00:13:27,167
Herbert, isn't it?

217
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:28,567
And Chad?

218
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:30,567
Do they fear going
out into the world?

219
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:33,633
Oh, they're just full of
themselves after training, ma'am.

220
00:13:33,767 --> 00:13:35,367
Go anywhere, do anything.

221
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:38,800
[chuckles] Mr. Beck's
efforts are appreciated?

222
00:13:38,933 --> 00:13:41,433
Greatly, ma'am, even
if he is a stickler.

223
00:13:41,567 --> 00:13:42,467
[Alexandra chuckles]

224
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:43,433
Mother says she'll not worry

225
00:13:43,567 --> 00:13:45,267
so much with Mr. Beck in charge.

226
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:46,833
Don't know why she
worries, anyway.

227
00:13:46,967 --> 00:13:48,967
It's all victory in the papers.

228
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:53,300
Even victory costs
lives, many lives.

229
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:55,200
Yes, ma'am.

230
00:13:56,433 --> 00:13:57,533
I believe you're ready.

231
00:14:03,733 --> 00:14:04,733
[sighs] Yes.

232
00:14:07,267 --> 00:14:08,433
Yes, I believe I am.

233
00:14:12,667 --> 00:14:16,367
You'll be happy to be
spared a parting, Mrs. Beck?

234
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:18,600
Keep Beck with his family, hm?

235
00:14:19,967 --> 00:14:23,200
Yes, ma'am, though I suspect
it grieves my husband

236
00:14:23,333 --> 00:14:25,833
if his age counts against him.

237
00:14:25,967 --> 00:14:29,367
Speaking as one who leaves
for Turkey ahead of the rest,

238
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:32,133
I could wish my age
kept me with my family.

239
00:14:33,533 --> 00:14:35,667
You can't wish it, Mr.
Pierrepoint Edwards,

240
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:38,133
surely not in the
present situation.

241
00:14:38,267 --> 00:14:41,333
I'm as fit and ready to go as
any of my youngest trainees

242
00:14:41,467 --> 00:14:44,200
and yet I can't share
their experience.

243
00:14:44,333 --> 00:14:45,467
I think you mean to humour me.

244
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:49,700
For heaven's sake, Beck,
you've done your bit!

245
00:14:49,833 --> 00:14:52,067
You've turned a rag-bag
of servants, grooms

246
00:14:52,167 --> 00:14:54,733
and gardeners into a
superb fighting force.

247
00:14:54,867 --> 00:14:56,467
We respect you for it.

248
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:57,867
Be satisfied.

249
00:14:58,067 --> 00:14:59,067
Sir.

250
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:03,067
Mother dear, at last.

251
00:15:07,733 --> 00:15:08,733
Dinner.

252
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:12,300
Would you take me in, Mr. Beck?

253
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:15,400
It would be a pleasure, ma'am.

254
00:15:25,733 --> 00:15:28,167
Darling, shall I
speak to the Queen?

255
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:29,767
We could marry before you leave.

256
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:34,600
No, no, I won't risk
making you a widow.

257
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:36,933
Well, why not?

258
00:15:37,067 --> 00:15:39,167
At least I would
have been a wife.

259
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:42,967
Let's wait until we have a
clear future ahead of us.

260
00:15:44,833 --> 00:15:48,500
[dramatic orchestral music]

261
00:15:49,967 --> 00:15:52,667
[Pierrepoint] Most gracious
God who has given us Christ

262
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:57,167
and with him all that is
necessary to life and godliness,

263
00:15:57,300 --> 00:16:00,867
we thankfully take this,
our food, as the gift

264
00:16:01,067 --> 00:16:04,100
of thy bounty procured
by his merits.

265
00:16:04,233 --> 00:16:07,300
Blessed to the
nourishment and strength

266
00:16:07,433 --> 00:16:10,567
of our bodies to fit
us for thy service.

267
00:16:12,533 --> 00:16:14,067
Amen.

268
00:16:14,167 --> 00:16:15,233
[All] Amen.

269
00:16:22,833 --> 00:16:25,600
[clock cranking]

270
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:47,700
I know you're
disappointed, Frank.

271
00:16:49,533 --> 00:16:50,667
The Queen understands, Mary.

272
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:51,867
She'd let me go.

273
00:16:53,467 --> 00:16:56,500
Perhaps, but it's
all been decided.

274
00:16:56,633 --> 00:16:57,800
Why brood about it?

275
00:16:57,933 --> 00:16:59,433
You said yourself the men could

276
00:16:59,567 --> 00:17:01,200
be back home in a few months.

277
00:17:02,367 --> 00:17:05,533
Covered in glory,
and none of it mine.

278
00:17:05,667 --> 00:17:08,367
[children giggling]

279
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:09,633
[Mary] What are you
doing out of bed?

280
00:17:09,767 --> 00:17:12,100
Come on, back upstairs at once.

281
00:17:12,233 --> 00:17:15,333
[children grumbling]

282
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:20,600
[people whooping and laughing]

283
00:17:20,733 --> 00:17:23,500
[waves crashing]

284

[upbeat orchestral music]

[bell dings]

287
00:18:17,667 --> 00:18:21,467
[Leader] By the
centre, quick march!

288
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:22,867
[drum beating]

289
00:18:23,067 --> 00:18:26,367
Left, right, left,
right, left, right, left.

290
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:30,167
Left, right, left,
right, left, right, left.

291
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:40,533
You wish you was
going with them?

292
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:42,733
Better than mucking out.

293
00:18:42,867 --> 00:18:44,200
I'll not be mucking out.

294
00:18:44,333 --> 00:18:46,800
Mr. Beck spoke for me
at the Post Office.

295
00:18:46,933 --> 00:18:49,067
I turn 12, I'll be on telegrams.

296
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,267
You what?

297
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:53,733
Telegrams, get a
bike and a uniform.

298
00:18:53,867 --> 00:18:56,467
[gulls cawing]

299
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:02,400
Listen.

300
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,967
I'd've taken more time over
this if I'd not been leaving.

301
00:19:07,533 --> 00:19:08,533
Look at you, Peg.

302
00:19:09,667 --> 00:19:11,600
You're so fresh
and neat, and me,

303
00:19:11,733 --> 00:19:12,700
just a grubby old gardener.

304
00:19:12,833 --> 00:19:15,700
I like the way you look.

305
00:19:15,833 --> 00:19:16,833
You do?

306
00:19:19,067 --> 00:19:20,867
Well, what's it to be, then?

307
00:19:21,067 --> 00:19:22,067
You know enough about me, born

308
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:23,867
and bred on the
estate, both of us.

309
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:27,467
I think I've loved you
since we were at school.

310
00:19:30,067 --> 00:19:30,767
It's a big step.

311
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:31,967
Shouldn't we go easy?

312
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:33,100
No, we shouldn't.

313
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:36,633
We should have some real
loving before I leave,

314
00:19:37,967 --> 00:19:40,067
but I'd only want that
if we were married.

315
00:19:41,467 --> 00:19:42,500
Oh, bless you, Ted.

316
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:45,700
I do love you.

317
00:19:48,133 --> 00:19:51,267
Well, that's all
right, then, isn't it?

318
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:52,533
That's all right!

319
00:19:52,667 --> 00:19:56,567
[sentimental orchestral music]

320
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,667
[Peggy giggles]

321
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:10,300
Here, you cut that out,
or you'll have me at it.

322
00:20:24,433 --> 00:20:26,633
[dog barking]

323
00:20:26,767 --> 00:20:29,267
[men playing]

324
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:35,733
[water splashing]

325
00:20:44,267 --> 00:20:47,167
Private Croft, Private Croft!

326
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:50,467
Am I to understand that you're
leading this riotous mob?

327
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:52,067
Only fun, Mr. Beck, sir.

328
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:54,100
It looks like
indiscipline to me!

329
00:20:54,233 --> 00:20:56,133
Has your training
taught you nothing?

330
00:20:56,267 --> 00:20:57,433
Now, come on!

331
00:20:57,567 --> 00:20:58,367
Corporal?

332
00:20:59,467 --> 00:21:00,467
Come on, lads.

333
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:03,400
Mr. Beck?

334
00:21:04,933 --> 00:21:06,400
Thought I knew the voice.

335
00:21:14,433 --> 00:21:15,800
I suppose someone else does your

336
00:21:15,933 --> 00:21:19,633
hardware supplies now,
Mr. Beck, on the estate.

337
00:21:19,767 --> 00:21:23,067
I sold my business when Roland
was shipped home from France.

338
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:25,800
He was a Regular, remember?

339
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:28,833
There you are.

340
00:21:28,967 --> 00:21:30,267
There's a good chap.

341
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:31,600
Ah, he is a good chap.

342
00:21:33,067 --> 00:21:36,067
We had a beautiful letter
from a Captain Buckland-Evers,

343
00:21:36,133 --> 00:21:38,767
saying Roland went bravely
forward in the service

344
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:41,700
of his country without
regard for his own safety.

345
00:21:41,833 --> 00:21:42,767
He's a hero.

346
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:44,300
That's what keeps us going.

347
00:21:44,433 --> 00:21:47,233
[Roland grunting]

348
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:49,900
A drop more, old chap.

349
00:21:50,067 --> 00:21:51,067
Come on.

350
00:21:57,667 --> 00:22:01,100
He can hear us, Mr. Adams,
but he can't communicate?

351
00:22:01,233 --> 00:22:04,600
We tried him with paper and
a pencil in the hospital,

352
00:22:04,733 --> 00:22:07,233
but we had to take
them away from him.

353
00:22:07,367 --> 00:22:10,067
What he wrote, it
upset his mother,

354
00:22:10,167 --> 00:22:15,167
upset all of us, terrible
stuff about what went on.

00:34:24,100 --> 00:34:25,100
Look, Peg.

534
00:34:26,333 --> 00:34:28,067
Something's happened.

535
00:34:29,433 --> 00:34:31,167
I reckon I'm nervous.

536
00:34:31,300 --> 00:34:33,067
I'm not sure as I
can do anything.

537
00:34:37,133 --> 00:34:38,567
And it could be our only night.

538
00:34:41,300 --> 00:34:42,333
We'll manage.

539
00:34:48,567 --> 00:34:51,333
[both smooching]

540
00:34:53,667 --> 00:34:57,333
[romantic orchestral music]

541
00:35:17,167 --> 00:35:19,700
Come on into me, now, Ted.

542
00:35:19,833 --> 00:35:21,333
I'm so ready for you.

543
00:35:26,700 --> 00:35:29,900
The vision of
Sandringham is a vision

544
00:35:30,067 --> 00:35:33,100
of beauty and of a
working community

545
00:35:33,233 --> 00:35:37,833
that stirs my heart more
than words can express,

546
00:35:39,267 --> 00:35:42,233
a vision that one man has
spent the last 30 years

547
00:35:42,367 --> 00:35:44,667
of his life turning
into a reality,

548
00:35:46,067 --> 00:35:48,067
which is why I honour him today,

549
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:51,733
in the presence of the
King and Queen Mary.

550
00:35:53,333 --> 00:35:56,367
Captain Beck, we salute you,

551
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:01,067
for your loyalty, for
your long service,

552
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:05,400
and for never
neglecting your duty.

553
00:36:14,767 --> 00:36:15,600
Thank you, ma'am.

554
00:36:15,733 --> 00:36:18,900
[audience applauding]

555
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:31,833
Your Majesties, I
thank you most humbly

556
00:36:31,967 --> 00:36:35,633
for this magnificent gift.

557
00:36:37,900 --> 00:36:39,600
It's true, ma'am,
I had a vision,

558
00:36:40,833 --> 00:36:42,733
and these men helped
me to achieve it.

559
00:36:43,833 --> 00:36:46,233
And now they have
another set before them,

560
00:36:46,367 --> 00:36:49,200
a vision to bring honour to
their country in time of war.

561
00:36:52,767 --> 00:36:55,100
And I've decided that I
must share this vision.

562
00:36:56,267 --> 00:36:57,600
Today, I signed
to serve overseas

563
00:36:57,733 --> 00:37:00,067
with the fifth battalion
of the Norfolk Regiment.

564
00:37:00,167 --> 00:37:01,900
[people cheering and applauding]

565
00:37:02,067 --> 00:37:06,100
[triumphant orchestral music]

566
00:37:06,233 --> 00:37:08,533
Listen to them, Georgie.

567
00:37:08,667 --> 00:37:09,900
Listen to them.

568
00:37:25,567 --> 00:37:29,233
[reverent orchestral music]

569
00:37:51,667 --> 00:37:56,233
I had a son once,
and had he lived,

570
00:37:56,367 --> 00:37:58,200
he would've be
standing here tonight.

571
00:38:01,100 --> 00:38:03,900
Now, I like to think
that I have many sons.

572
00:38:05,067 --> 00:38:07,333
I've certainly held one
or two of you rascals

573
00:38:07,467 --> 00:38:10,067
in my arms in the first
few days of your lives.

574
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:13,233
[men chuckle]

575
00:38:13,367 --> 00:38:15,333
So what shall I
tell your families?

576
00:38:17,967 --> 00:38:20,300
I shall tell them that
whilst we're away,

577
00:38:21,433 --> 00:38:24,300
I will be your father,
and, God willing,

578
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:27,233
I'll bring you all
safely back home.

579
00:38:33,700 --> 00:38:34,933
Carry on, Sergeant Grimes.

580
00:38:35,067 --> 00:38:36,567
Yes, sir.

581
00:38:36,700 --> 00:38:38,167
Company, attention!

582
00:38:40,933 --> 00:38:42,433
Company, fall out!

583
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:46,200
[men clomping]

584
00:38:46,333 --> 00:38:50,067
[dramatic orchestral music]

585
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:02,067
Number one platoon, eyes right!

586
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:13,600
Face right.

587
00:39:21,933 --> 00:39:24,700
Number one platoon,
eyes forward!

588
00:39:53,933 --> 00:39:55,733
[men socialising]

589
00:39:55,867 --> 00:39:58,367
[man retches]

590
00:40:00,533 --> 00:40:01,433
What's going on?

591
00:40:01,567 --> 00:40:03,133
We dropped anchor two hours ago.

592
00:40:03,267 --> 00:40:04,667
Why aren't the holds open?

593
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:05,600
It's not my business.

594
00:40:05,733 --> 00:40:07,067
I answer to the deck officer.

595
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:08,300
Well, where is he?

596
00:40:08,433 --> 00:40:09,633
We can't move without
food and equipment.

597
00:40:09,767 --> 00:40:12,267
You've got water, bully
beef, biscuits and jam.

598
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:13,900
The rest of it's not up to me.

599
00:40:16,133 --> 00:40:17,533
[Frederick] Were you prepared
for this, Private Needham?

600
00:40:17,667 --> 00:40:18,967
I was never a boy scout, sir.

601
00:40:19,100 --> 00:40:20,100
Thank God.

602
00:40:21,167 --> 00:40:23,567
Seems a back-hander
would work wonders.

603
00:40:23,700 --> 00:40:25,867
Get a hold open, four
or five of us go in,

604
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,933
grab what we want and out again.

605
00:40:28,067 --> 00:40:29,300
You fit, sir?

606
00:40:29,433 --> 00:40:30,767
I'm with you, Private Needham.

607
00:40:30,900 --> 00:40:34,233
I'll be back with
the other lads, sir.

608
00:40:35,133 --> 00:40:38,200
[explosions booming]

609
00:40:44,633 --> 00:40:47,167
[men shouting]

610
00:40:56,233 --> 00:40:58,800
[men yelping]

611
00:40:58,933 --> 00:41:01,767
[water splashing]

612
00:41:17,333 --> 00:41:19,167
Captain Beck!

613
00:41:19,300 --> 00:41:20,333
Welcome to Turkey.

614
00:41:20,467 --> 00:41:22,067
[Frank] Mr. Pierrepoint
Edwards, sir!

615
00:41:22,167 --> 00:41:24,533
Good to see you, you've
survived your ordeal?

616
00:41:25,633 --> 00:41:27,600
Overcrowding, vomit and boredom?

617
00:41:27,733 --> 00:41:30,067
No, I have no doubt
discovered that supplies

618
00:41:30,133 --> 00:41:32,400
will not flow to you
like manna from heaven?

619
00:41:34,067 --> 00:41:35,133
I'm puzzled, sir.

620
00:41:35,267 --> 00:41:36,467
We were supposed to
pick up a vehicle

621
00:41:36,600 --> 00:41:38,467
and load it with
necessities from the ships.

622
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:41,167
A vehicle and orders, I'm
here eight days ahead of you

623
00:41:41,300 --> 00:41:44,733
and I can no longer
connect orders to reality.

624
00:41:44,867 --> 00:41:47,400
[Frank] Mr. Edwards, is it true

625
00:41:47,533 --> 00:41:49,467
that some of our
ships have been sunk?

626
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:51,900
True, Captain Beck,
and the survivors

627
00:41:52,067 --> 00:41:54,633
scraped off the
cliffs like flies.

628
00:41:54,767 --> 00:41:56,633
Still, it's a
novelty to be called

629
00:41:56,767 --> 00:41:59,533
to a man dying of his wounds
rather than dysentery.

630
00:41:59,667 --> 00:42:01,433
If you'll forgive me, I'm dug in

631
00:42:01,567 --> 00:42:04,167
half a mile along the
line to the north.

632
00:42:04,300 --> 00:42:05,867
Let's hope we meet again.

633
00:42:06,067 --> 00:42:06,700
- [explosion booms]
- [horse whinnies]

634
00:42:06,833 --> 00:42:07,833
Yes, sir.

635
00:42:09,567 --> 00:42:12,400
[men socialising]

636
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:23,100
[Ted] You all right, George?

637
00:42:24,533 --> 00:42:27,367
Bloody regulation seasick
pills, what they doing?

638
00:42:27,500 --> 00:42:28,367
Testing them on us?

639
00:42:28,500 --> 00:42:29,300
Bastards!

640
00:42:29,433 --> 00:42:30,600
You should've spewed up straight

641
00:42:30,733 --> 00:42:31,833
like the rest of us, George.

642
00:42:31,967 --> 00:42:34,400
Feller along there
landed two days ago.

643
00:42:34,533 --> 00:42:38,300
Says the Aussies copped it
along the coast, copped it bad.

644
00:42:38,433 --> 00:42:40,400
He's after our supplies and all.

645
00:42:40,533 --> 00:42:42,567
Says his lot got
nothing off their ships.

646
00:42:46,067 --> 00:42:47,933
You will each be directed
to a point on the line

647
00:42:48,067 --> 00:42:52,233
between Gaba Tepe in the
southwest and Kiretch Tepe

648
00:42:52,367 --> 00:42:55,967
in the northeast, where
you will pitch camp.

649
00:42:56,100 --> 00:42:58,467
We're not yet sure of the
Turks' exact position,

650
00:42:58,600 --> 00:43:00,833
but you'll receive messages
as the information comes in.

651
00:43:00,967 --> 00:43:02,067
This gunfire, sir, it seems

652
00:43:02,200 --> 00:43:04,367
fairly close, barely
half a mile away.

653
00:43:04,500 --> 00:43:05,833
A few stragglers in
the shore battery,

654
00:43:05,967 --> 00:43:08,600
that's all, left over
from the last engagement.

655
00:43:08,733 --> 00:43:11,733
Well, why don't we take them
first before moving on, sir?

656
00:43:11,867 --> 00:43:13,767
That famous zeal, Captain Beck.

657
00:43:13,900 --> 00:43:17,533
Much admired in training,
hardly appropriate here.

658
00:43:17,667 --> 00:43:19,900
We'll be ready for the Turks
when they show themselves.

659
00:43:20,067 --> 00:43:22,300
And remember, though the
Germans have attempted

660
00:43:22,433 --> 00:43:25,933
to impose some order, they
are essentially barbarians

661
00:43:26,067 --> 00:43:27,700
and no match for a disciplined

662
00:43:27,833 --> 00:43:29,100
force of well-equipped soldiers.

663
00:43:29,233 --> 00:43:31,800
Thank you, gentlemen.

664
00:43:31,933 --> 00:43:32,633
All right, come on.

665
00:43:32,767 --> 00:43:33,467
Let's get going.

666
00:43:33,600 --> 00:43:34,967
- Sir?
- Yeah.

667
00:43:35,100 --> 00:43:36,867
Radley's still on
board with a detail.

668
00:43:37,067 --> 00:43:39,867
He's hoping to bag
some more supplies.

669
00:43:40,067 --> 00:43:41,567
Who gave the orders?

670
00:43:45,833 --> 00:43:46,633
Sergeant, get the men fell in!

671
00:43:46,767 --> 00:43:48,200
Yes, sir.

672
00:43:48,333 --> 00:43:49,567
Men, get full line!

673
00:43:49,700 --> 00:43:52,133
Come on, let's get up
and moving, eh, boys?

674
00:43:52,267 --> 00:43:53,100
Come on!

675
00:43:53,233 --> 00:43:56,167
[gravel crunching]

676
00:44:02,833 --> 00:44:06,500
[ominous orchestral music]

677
00:44:37,133 --> 00:44:42,133
[Ted] Peggy, my
dearest love, well,

678
00:44:43,333 --> 00:44:44,300
this is me overseas
for the first time.

679
00:44:44,433 --> 00:44:45,333
Eyes front!

680
00:44:45,467 --> 00:44:46,600
Nothing pretty about this place,

681
00:44:46,733 --> 00:44:49,700
though, just rocky
ground and a rough road.

682
00:44:51,600 --> 00:44:53,967
I think often of your sweet face

683
00:44:54,100 --> 00:44:56,200
and how I shall kiss
it when we next meet.

684
00:45:04,667 --> 00:45:07,667
[chickens clucking]

685
00:45:19,933 --> 00:45:22,600
[door knocking]

686
00:45:28,867 --> 00:45:31,067
Good afternoon, it's
Mr. Yeoman, isn't it?

687
00:45:33,433 --> 00:45:36,067
I heard, in the Post Office,
used to be your aunt's house.

688
00:45:36,200 --> 00:45:37,233
I knew the lady.

689
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:40,200
I'm Mrs. Grimes,
from the estate.

690
00:45:42,333 --> 00:45:45,100
Her Majesty, that's the Queen,
Queen Alexandra, thought

691
00:45:45,233 --> 00:45:48,200
we should show our appreciation
of your effort in the war.

692
00:45:48,333 --> 00:45:50,800
So, there's a few dainties
here from the kitchen.

693
00:45:54,600 --> 00:45:55,733
We all have loved
ones of our own

694
00:45:55,867 --> 00:45:58,600
in the war, see,
in the Dardanelles.

695
00:45:58,733 --> 00:46:00,633
I expect you were
wounded at Mons.

696
00:46:00,767 --> 00:46:04,067
Thank you, and you may thank

697
00:46:04,167 --> 00:46:06,233
Her Majesty for
her kind gesture.

698
00:46:09,467 --> 00:46:11,567
Your hair.

699
00:46:14,133 --> 00:46:16,733
[Peggy laughs]

700
00:46:19,733 --> 00:46:22,233
I daresay there'll be more
where these come from.

701
00:46:22,367 --> 00:46:25,667
No, there must be no more.

702
00:46:27,300 --> 00:46:28,300
Goodbye.

703
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:48,067
[men socialising]

704
00:46:51,067 --> 00:46:53,333
From you all, boys, we need
to get these tents up quickly.

705
00:46:53,467 --> 00:46:54,667
Stokes and Stubbard, make sure

706
00:46:54,800 --> 00:46:56,233
the guide ropes are
tight, all right?

707
00:46:56,367 --> 00:46:57,867
Captain Beck, sir.

708
00:47:03,900 --> 00:47:06,833
Fancy a bit of
bully beef, do we?

709
00:47:08,067 --> 00:47:11,633
- [Davy retches]
- Urgh, Davy.

710
00:47:20,767 --> 00:47:23,433
[clock ticking]

711
00:47:31,400 --> 00:47:34,667
[Soldier] Sir, a
man approaching sir!

712
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:42,467
[Soldier] That's
Lieutenant Radley, sir!

713
00:47:42,600 --> 00:47:44,167
[Soldier] And
Private Needham, sir!

714
00:47:44,300 --> 00:47:46,900
[men cheering]

715
00:48:00,833 --> 00:48:02,467
Sorry we took so long, sir.

716
00:48:02,600 --> 00:48:03,700
Once Private Needham had bagged

717
00:48:03,833 --> 00:48:05,300
the transport, we
had to pack it.

718
00:48:06,867 --> 00:48:07,967
All of this authorised?

719
00:48:08,100 --> 00:48:09,500
There's no one to
authorise, sir.

720
00:48:09,633 --> 00:48:10,733
It's a free-for-all back there,

721
00:48:10,867 --> 00:48:13,567
sir, well, not exactly free.

722
00:48:14,933 --> 00:48:16,667
Lieutenant Radley shifted
a fortune in bribes.

723
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:19,433
There are rules,
Lieutenant Radley,

724
00:48:19,567 --> 00:48:20,867
procedures governing the issue

725
00:48:21,067 --> 00:48:23,067
of supplies, as with
everything else.

726
00:48:23,133 --> 00:48:24,600
My men are taught
to follow the rules.

727
00:48:24,733 --> 00:48:26,067
This is reckless behaviour.

728
00:48:26,167 --> 00:48:27,433
I'll have no more of it.

729
00:48:30,133 --> 00:48:32,867
Permission to return
the transport, sir?

730
00:48:33,067 --> 00:48:34,067
Permission granted.

731
00:48:43,367 --> 00:48:44,467
What do you say to the first cup

732
00:48:44,600 --> 00:48:46,267
of coffee since
we left home, sir?

733
00:48:51,367 --> 00:48:54,100
I'd say bravo, Alec, bravo.

734
00:48:56,867 --> 00:48:59,367
Reconnaissance, we
should be familiar

735
00:48:59,500 --> 00:49:01,167
with our area of defence.

736
00:49:01,300 --> 00:49:03,467
Now, I've marked
the limits and they

737
00:49:03,600 --> 00:49:05,667
shouldn't be too
difficult to cover.

738
00:49:05,800 --> 00:49:09,967
They are from the stretch
of woods here in the west

739
00:49:10,100 --> 00:49:12,267
to the flat top
hill in the east.

740
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:13,233
You with me?

741
00:49:13,367 --> 00:49:14,867
- Yes, sir.
- Mm-hm.

742
00:49:15,067 --> 00:49:16,567
Lieutenant Radley?

743
00:49:16,700 --> 00:49:19,700
The flat-topped hill is about
two miles to the south, sir.

744
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:21,900
What?

745
00:49:22,067 --> 00:49:23,333
I checked before I
returned the carts.

746
00:49:23,467 --> 00:49:26,500
To the men who arrived before
us, the maps are a joke.

747
00:49:26,633 --> 00:49:29,300
There's been an official
complaint, but the word is

748
00:49:29,433 --> 00:49:32,633
we're to use our initiative
and to make corrections.

749
00:49:32,767 --> 00:49:35,600
[explosion booms]

750
00:49:41,167 --> 00:49:44,067
Have you any further
gossip for us, Mr. Radley?

751
00:49:45,433 --> 00:49:48,300
It's said that the enemy puts
on rather a good show, sir.

752
00:49:48,433 --> 00:49:50,233
He's light on his feet, a genius

753
00:49:50,367 --> 00:49:52,933
at camouflage and
strikes like a snake.

754
00:49:54,100 --> 00:49:56,400
He's also said to be
closer than we think.

755
00:50:00,700 --> 00:50:01,967
[man groans]

756
00:50:02,100 --> 00:50:05,467
Dacre's recovered,
complications of gut rot,

757
00:50:05,600 --> 00:50:09,833
no sign of dysentery yet, but
we're already low on water.

758
00:50:09,967 --> 00:50:10,967
I know.

759
00:50:12,733 --> 00:50:13,933
What's the matter
with Private Croft?

760
00:50:14,067 --> 00:50:15,200
[Davy groans]

761
00:50:15,333 --> 00:50:18,467
Oh, nothing much,
a touch of fever.

762
00:50:18,600 --> 00:50:20,833
Fever, what kind of fever?

763
00:50:20,967 --> 00:50:23,167
Why wasn't it
reported immediately?

764
00:50:23,300 --> 00:50:25,267
Is it the kind that will spread?

765
00:50:25,400 --> 00:50:26,567
Well, not unless the men's

766
00:50:26,700 --> 00:50:29,333
sleeping habits
change drastically.

767
00:50:29,467 --> 00:50:30,800
Men's sleeping habits?

768
00:50:33,067 --> 00:50:35,867
It's a dose of clap,
Captain Beck, gonorrhoea,

769
00:50:37,300 --> 00:50:40,267
caught from a girl in Liverpool
the night before we sailed.

770
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:43,500
I always put Private Croft
down as a clean-living man.

771
00:50:43,633 --> 00:50:45,300
Instead of just
a fool, you mean?

772
00:50:46,500 --> 00:50:48,367
Well, he should have
gone armoured, like me.

773
00:50:50,200 --> 00:50:53,600
I had the same girl
straight afterwards.

774
00:50:53,733 --> 00:50:54,933
Well, the Sandringham
estate doesn't

775
00:50:55,067 --> 00:50:57,167
cater for every
recreational need.

776
00:50:59,833 --> 00:51:04,800
Captain Beck, why don't I
borrow one of those maps, hm?

777
00:51:05,967 --> 00:51:07,633
I'll take a couple of
men on a reconnaissance

778
00:51:07,767 --> 00:51:09,467
and try to make a
few corrections.

779
00:51:11,967 --> 00:51:14,667
At least we'll know
whereabouts in hell we are.

780
00:51:23,067 --> 00:51:24,200
Sir?

781
00:51:24,333 --> 00:51:26,467
It's the stink and the
cold at night, sir.

782
00:51:26,600 --> 00:51:27,733
It's a big shock after the heat.

783
00:51:27,867 --> 00:51:29,533
Any chance of more blankets?

784
00:51:29,667 --> 00:51:31,567
And the water's going down fast.

785
00:51:31,700 --> 00:51:34,400
There's no blankets, the
stink's probably a fixture,

786
00:51:34,533 --> 00:51:36,133
and the water is meant
to last 'til we move on.

787
00:51:36,267 --> 00:51:38,367
That's all right if
we move soon, sir.

788
00:51:40,067 --> 00:51:41,800
Yes, well, I'm
confident we will.

789
00:51:42,900 --> 00:51:43,900
Go on.

790
00:51:45,633 --> 00:51:46,633
Excuse me, sir.

791
00:51:47,867 --> 00:51:49,400
I think you got the time wrong.

792
00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:53,400
That's Sandringham
time, Sergeant,

793
00:51:53,533 --> 00:51:55,733
so I always know
what's going on there.

794
00:51:55,867 --> 00:51:58,500
[clock ticking]

795
00:52:00,467 --> 00:52:03,333
I keep remembering that old
bugger of a swan off the lake.

796
00:52:04,567 --> 00:52:06,600
It'd come to me every
day for his scraps.

797
00:52:08,333 --> 00:52:09,933
I hope Peggy thinks to feed him.

798
00:52:11,967 --> 00:52:14,167
It's the oaks in
the spinney with me,

799
00:52:15,700 --> 00:52:19,400
August, clearing
the first leaves.

800
00:52:23,400 --> 00:52:25,767
Did I know everything
that went on there?

801
00:52:26,933 --> 00:52:28,233
I mean, if there was
trouble on the estate,

802
00:52:28,367 --> 00:52:30,400
for instance, did I
get to hear about it?

803
00:52:31,833 --> 00:52:33,233
By and large you did, sir.

804
00:52:34,733 --> 00:52:35,733
By and large?

805
00:52:37,633 --> 00:52:40,067
That's how I'd put it, sir.

806
00:52:45,067 --> 00:52:46,267
Ah, carry on.

807
00:52:49,733 --> 00:52:52,500
[tools clanking]

808
00:52:52,633 --> 00:52:55,433
[men socialising]

809
00:53:01,367 --> 00:53:02,800
Got a problem, Lieutenant?

810
00:53:02,933 --> 00:53:04,767
Oh, no problem, sir.

811
00:53:06,700 --> 00:53:08,133
Just about there.

812
00:53:09,600 --> 00:53:11,633
It might help if you had the
feed block the right way up.

813
00:53:11,767 --> 00:53:12,800
[men snicker]

814
00:53:12,933 --> 00:53:14,733
[gun fires]

815
00:53:14,867 --> 00:53:15,667
- Corporal!
- [whistle blows]

816
00:53:15,800 --> 00:53:16,933
- Sir?
- Get me two men!

817
00:53:17,067 --> 00:53:20,300
[Herbert] Burge,
Steadman, follow me!

818
00:53:41,600 --> 00:53:45,267
[dramatic orchestral music]

819
00:53:50,667 --> 00:53:53,067
[gun fires]

820
00:53:58,767 --> 00:54:00,800
Corporal, one wounded!

821
00:54:01,967 --> 00:54:02,633
All right.

822
00:54:02,767 --> 00:54:05,767
[George whimpering]

823
00:54:12,833 --> 00:54:14,667
Come on, Captain Beck.

824
00:54:15,800 --> 00:54:16,967
Come on, fall back!

825
00:54:17,100 --> 00:54:17,867
Fall back!

826
00:54:18,067 --> 00:54:20,567
[men shouting]

827
00:54:28,700 --> 00:54:31,433
[George sobbing]

828
00:54:33,667 --> 00:54:35,100
[Claude] Sting?

829
00:54:40,833 --> 00:54:41,933
Clean him up.

830
00:54:51,567 --> 00:54:53,467
It was heroic what you
did for George Dacre.

831
00:54:53,600 --> 00:54:55,133
I'm going to mention
you in my report.

832
00:54:55,267 --> 00:54:56,533
What for, a medal?

833
00:54:56,667 --> 00:54:58,067
You have the medal,
Captain Beck.

834
00:54:58,200 --> 00:55:00,233
You'd scorn a medal?

835
00:55:00,367 --> 00:55:02,333
What else are we here for if
not to prove ourselves as men?

836
00:55:02,467 --> 00:55:05,233
Well, I'm here to get the
clean bullet through the brain

837
00:55:05,367 --> 00:55:08,367
that I don't have the
courage to put there myself.

838
00:55:08,500 --> 00:55:10,167
I'd ask you not to take that
line in front of the men.

839
00:55:10,300 --> 00:55:11,767
It's lowering.

840
00:55:11,900 --> 00:55:13,433
Meanwhile, we wait, snipers,

841
00:55:13,567 --> 00:55:15,900
of course, but no
water, no supplies,

842
00:55:16,067 --> 00:55:18,733
I'll allow some conditions
don't meet expectations.

843
00:55:18,867 --> 00:55:20,233
Expectations?

844
00:55:20,367 --> 00:55:24,767
I left my expectations with
the Boers in South Africa,

845
00:55:24,900 --> 00:55:28,300
in a British concentration camp

846
00:55:28,433 --> 00:55:32,200
where I was supposed to keep
the civilian population alive,

847
00:55:32,333 --> 00:55:37,333
women, children, and where I
failed, for lack of support.

848
00:55:40,367 --> 00:55:44,067
[dramatic orchestral music]

849
00:56:17,933 --> 00:56:22,933
- [thunder rumbling]
- [crickets chirping]

850
00:56:35,567 --> 00:56:38,067
[Ted panting]

851
00:56:47,533 --> 00:56:51,467
[suspenseful orchestral music]

852
00:57:27,600 --> 00:57:29,767
[gun clicks]

853
00:57:29,900 --> 00:57:31,567
[Frederick] For Christ's sake!

854
00:57:31,700 --> 00:57:33,300
Come and have a
look at this, sir.

855
00:57:48,200 --> 00:57:51,867
[dramatic orchestral music]

856
00:58:11,067 --> 00:58:12,467
Didn't you tell me once we'd be

857
00:58:12,600 --> 00:58:14,267
fighting near the
plains of Troy?

858
00:58:22,200 --> 00:58:25,967
"Then could be heard the
voices of men, in their triumph"

859
00:58:26,100 --> 00:58:30,633
"and their glory, the
slayers and the slain,"

860
00:58:30,767 --> 00:58:33,400
"their blood spilling
on the earth."

861
00:58:34,700 --> 00:58:35,700
This earth.

862
00:58:37,600 --> 00:58:39,600
Is that what it's about, sir?

863
00:58:39,733 --> 00:58:40,733
What you're reading?

864
00:58:41,733 --> 00:58:43,267
Killing and that?

865
00:58:43,400 --> 00:58:46,867
It's about rivalry and
comradeship in war.

866
00:58:47,967 --> 00:58:50,433
I keep thinking I
could be dead, no time.

867
00:58:50,567 --> 00:58:52,100
Can't get worked up about it.

868
00:58:53,533 --> 00:58:56,067
I reckon I've done most things
I want to do in my life.

869
00:58:56,167 --> 00:58:57,167
Most things?

870
00:58:59,067 --> 00:59:00,200
Women?

871
00:59:00,333 --> 00:59:03,667
Oh, women, yeah, most things.

872
00:59:07,267 --> 00:59:07,967
How old are you?

873
00:59:08,100 --> 00:59:09,100
[Will] 18.

874
00:59:10,600 --> 00:59:12,600
I'm 28 and I've done nothing.

875
00:59:15,600 --> 00:59:16,933
Women?

876
00:59:17,067 --> 00:59:20,700
Nothing, this is the nearest
I've ever got to living.

877
00:59:22,833 --> 00:59:23,867
We'll just have to get you a bit

878
00:59:24,067 --> 00:59:26,800
nearer then, won't we, sir?

879
00:59:30,067 --> 00:59:32,433

00:59:38,567 --> 00:59:40,800
Sorry I'm late, sir.

[gunfire rattles]

884
00:59:43,400 --> 00:59:45,600
We go in tomorrow at
a quarter past four.

885
00:59:47,067 --> 00:59:50,400
White patches will be sewn to
the backs of officers' tunics,

886
00:59:50,533 --> 00:59:53,133
so that the men will
recognise them in the field.

887
00:59:53,267 --> 00:59:56,100
[Claude laughs]

888
00:59:56,233 --> 00:59:57,633
Evelyn.

889
00:59:57,767 --> 00:59:58,600
Yes, Sergeant.

890
00:59:59,633 --> 01:00:01,033
We're in trouble, sir.

891
01:00:01,167 --> 01:00:02,800
I saw movements on
watch last night.

892
01:00:02,933 --> 01:00:05,533
One of them bastards went
by wearing a pig's head.

893
01:00:05,667 --> 01:00:06,367
A pig's head?

894
01:00:06,500 --> 01:00:07,867
No, they do that, sir.

895
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:09,367
It's the talk of the line.

896
01:00:09,500 --> 01:00:11,100
You ask me, there's
more of them,

897
01:00:11,233 --> 01:00:13,567
three or four maybe,
setting up to the south now.

898
01:00:13,700 --> 01:00:15,800
When we move, they'll
have us from behind.

899
01:00:20,367 --> 01:00:22,133
If there are snipers
out there, we can't

900
01:00:22,267 --> 01:00:24,133
move forward until
we flush them out.

901
01:00:25,733 --> 01:00:29,267
Mr. Radley, you will go
on reconnaissance tonight.

902
01:00:29,400 --> 01:00:30,933
Sergeant Grimes
will be your guide

903
01:00:31,067 --> 01:00:32,400
and take another man with you.

904
01:00:32,533 --> 01:00:33,733
Private Needham, sir.

905
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:36,900
All right, very well.

906
01:00:47,233 --> 01:00:49,700
By the way, we have our
first case of dysentery.

907
01:00:51,667 --> 01:00:56,000
So, if the Turks don't get us,
we could die in our own shit.

908
01:01:05,200 --> 01:01:08,633
[mellow harmonica music]

909
01:01:17,267 --> 01:01:20,367
[Frederick whistles]

910
01:01:37,200 --> 01:01:39,433
[Soldier] Good luck, Ted!

911
01:01:48,400 --> 01:01:53,367
- [glass shattering]
- [people shouting]

912
01:01:59,800 --> 01:02:01,400
What's happening?

913
01:02:02,200 --> 01:02:03,500
What's he done?

914
01:02:03,633 --> 01:02:04,967
He's no hero, that one.

915
01:02:05,100 --> 01:02:05,800
You know what he is?

916
01:02:05,933 --> 01:02:07,333
He's a bloody coward!

917
01:02:07,467 --> 01:02:08,767
He was injured, wasn't he?

918
01:02:08,900 --> 01:02:10,400
He belong with that lot
what's trying to stop the war.

919
01:02:10,533 --> 01:02:11,833
That's in the papers.

920
01:02:11,967 --> 01:02:14,067
Came out of college,
took a job in a hospital.

921
01:02:14,200 --> 01:02:16,533
Bunch of squatties recovering
from their wounds in there

922
01:02:16,667 --> 01:02:18,900
threw him out the window,
and good for them, I say.

923
01:02:19,067 --> 01:02:20,867
No, that's terrible, that is.

924
01:02:21,067 --> 01:02:22,233
Least he was working
in a hospital.

925
01:02:22,367 --> 01:02:23,533
Do you fancy that?

926
01:02:23,667 --> 01:02:24,400
Go on, now, get home!

927
01:02:24,533 --> 01:02:26,067
You've done your worst.

928
01:02:26,133 --> 01:02:27,767
I got a husband and
brothers in the fighting,

929
01:02:27,900 --> 01:02:28,967
but I don't go on like that.

930
01:02:29,100 --> 01:02:31,300
Go on, now, stop it!

931
01:02:31,433 --> 01:02:33,433
Go on, get home!

932
01:02:33,567 --> 01:02:34,567
Go on!

933
01:02:36,433 --> 01:02:37,433
Get home!

934
01:02:38,867 --> 01:02:39,867
Go on.

935
01:02:56,967 --> 01:02:57,967
Thank you.

936
01:02:59,667 --> 01:03:01,567
You were remarkable.

937
01:03:01,700 --> 01:03:02,367
[Peggy] You should've said.

938
01:03:02,500 --> 01:03:03,733
I know.

939
01:03:03,867 --> 01:03:04,867
I'm sorry.

940
01:03:06,600 --> 01:03:08,267
I'd very much like
talk to talk...

941
01:03:08,400 --> 01:03:09,467
Don't say anything more!

942
01:03:09,600 --> 01:03:10,960
I can't be seen
talking to you now.

943
01:03:11,967 --> 01:03:12,967
Come on, Luke.

944
01:03:20,933 --> 01:03:21,900
A pacifist?

945
01:03:22,067 --> 01:03:23,567
How unfortunate.

946
01:03:23,700 --> 01:03:26,300
I don't believe he's
a coward, ma'am.

947
01:03:26,433 --> 01:03:28,833
We are compelled to
believe he is a coward.

948
01:03:29,900 --> 01:03:31,233
Do you understand?

949
01:03:31,367 --> 01:03:32,367
Yes, ma'am.

950
01:03:34,333 --> 01:03:37,900
You seem particularly
low tonight, Grimes.

951
01:03:39,100 --> 01:03:40,700
You feel sorry for this man?

952
01:03:40,833 --> 01:03:42,167
Oh, it's not that, ma'am.

953
01:03:43,867 --> 01:03:46,700
If I'm gloomy, it's
nothing I could tell you.

954
01:03:46,833 --> 01:03:48,167
If I should disapprove, I should

955
01:03:48,300 --> 01:03:50,067
quickly change the subject.

956
01:03:53,700 --> 01:03:55,333
I thought Ted might
leave me with the hope

957
01:03:55,467 --> 01:03:59,067
of a child, ma'am,
but it's not to be.

958
01:04:00,633 --> 01:04:04,367
Ah, well, for
myself, I'm not sorry

959
01:04:06,767 --> 01:04:08,467
because I should
hate to lose you.

960
01:04:19,300 --> 01:04:21,467
A cable from the War
Office, Mother dear.

961
01:04:21,600 --> 01:04:23,433
The attack will be tomorrow.

962
01:04:23,567 --> 01:04:25,133
The men are expected to engage

963
01:04:25,267 --> 01:04:27,100
with the Turks in
the late afternoon.

964
01:04:29,100 --> 01:04:31,667
Lord Kitchener is
confident of victory.

965
01:04:33,333 --> 01:04:36,100
Well, let us hope his
confidence costs us

966
01:04:36,233 --> 01:04:39,633
less in Turkey than it
has in France, Georgie.

967
01:05:39,767 --> 01:05:40,567
[body squelches]

968
01:05:40,700 --> 01:05:41,933
[suspenseful orchestral music]

969
01:05:42,067 --> 01:05:44,567
[Will groans]

970
01:06:11,667 --> 01:06:14,700
[sword clinging]

971
01:06:14,833 --> 01:06:15,633
[men grunting]

972
01:06:15,767 --> 01:06:17,400
Where are they, you bastard?

973
01:06:17,533 --> 01:06:19,967
What have you done with them?

974
01:06:21,900 --> 01:06:23,800
[woman sobs]

975
01:06:23,933 --> 01:06:25,067
Jesus Christ!

976
01:06:26,167 --> 01:06:28,833
[both grunting]

977
01:06:34,100 --> 01:06:35,833
Right, you're
having it, you are.

978
01:06:35,967 --> 01:06:36,833
You're getting it.

979
01:06:36,967 --> 01:06:38,467
[woman whimpering]

980
01:06:38,600 --> 01:06:39,867
I'm having you.

981
01:06:56,633 --> 01:06:59,533
All right, you're my prisoner.

982
01:06:59,667 --> 01:07:00,667
Move!

983
01:07:01,800 --> 01:07:06,567
- [gun fires]
- [Ted gurgles]

984
01:07:08,067 --> 01:07:11,733
[dramatic orchestral music]

985
01:07:13,067 --> 01:07:14,967
[Soldier] That's
Lieutenant Radley!

986
01:07:15,100 --> 01:07:17,667
[men shouting]

987
01:07:27,467 --> 01:07:29,133
[gun fires]

988
01:07:29,267 --> 01:07:31,433
[Frederick wailing]

989
01:07:31,567 --> 01:07:33,233
Lieutenant Radley!

990
01:07:34,900 --> 01:07:36,900
There's no chance.

991
01:07:37,067 --> 01:07:37,867
It's all right.

992
01:07:38,067 --> 01:07:40,167
It's all over, Radley.

993
01:07:40,300 --> 01:07:41,333
[Soldier] Where's Ted?

994
01:07:41,467 --> 01:07:43,633
[Frank] Where's Sergeant Grimes?

995
01:07:43,767 --> 01:07:46,900
[Frederick] He's gone. [groans]

996
01:07:47,067 --> 01:07:48,200
All right.

997
01:07:48,333 --> 01:07:51,400
[explosions booming]

998
01:07:51,533 --> 01:07:54,767
Corporal, get the
men to gather around.

999
01:07:54,900 --> 01:07:55,900
Sir.

1000
01:07:57,167 --> 01:07:58,233
Gather around, men.

1001
01:07:58,367 --> 01:08:00,067
Not a funeral,
for Christ's sake!

1002
01:08:00,167 --> 01:08:01,933
What a bloody waste, huh?

1003
01:08:05,867 --> 01:08:07,700
It's all bloody waste and chaos.

1004
01:08:10,567 --> 01:08:11,833
And I'd not be in
this bloody waste

1005
01:08:11,967 --> 01:08:13,700
and chaos if it wasn't for you.

1006
01:08:13,833 --> 01:08:16,667
[Evelyn] [chuckles] Have
you ever heard of free will?

1007
01:08:19,533 --> 01:08:21,100
I don't mean you egged me on.

1008
01:08:22,300 --> 01:08:25,500
I mean I signed up
to look after you.

1009
01:08:27,533 --> 01:08:29,367
What an idiot, eh, me?

1010
01:08:39,100 --> 01:08:41,600
They can't know, can they?

1011
01:08:41,733 --> 01:08:45,200
Division, they can't mean
us to walk to our deaths?

1012
01:08:47,833 --> 01:08:49,233
You've always
trusted the judgement

1013
01:08:49,367 --> 01:08:52,433
of your betters,
haven't you, Frank?

1014
01:08:54,167 --> 01:08:58,133
That's fine for
Sandringham or paradise.

1015
01:09:14,167 --> 01:09:16,467
You will address the
men, Lieutenant Radley.

1016
01:09:34,300 --> 01:09:38,567
If I should die,
think only this of me,

1017
01:09:40,100 --> 01:09:42,533
that there's some corner
of a foreign field

1018
01:09:43,367 --> 01:09:45,067
that is forever England.

1019
01:09:46,867 --> 01:09:50,400
And there shall be
in that rich earth

1020
01:09:50,533 --> 01:09:55,533
a richer dust concealed,
a dust whom England bore,

1021
01:09:56,967 --> 01:10:00,800
shaped, made aware, gave
once her flowers to love,

1022
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:05,400
her way to roam, a
body of England's,

1023
01:10:05,533 --> 01:10:08,467
breathing English air, washed by

1024
01:10:08,600 --> 01:10:12,067
the rivers, blessed
by suns of home.

1025
01:10:12,200 --> 01:10:13,667
[dramatic orchestral music]

1026
01:10:13,800 --> 01:10:18,800
And think, this heart,
all evil shed away,

1027
01:10:20,800 --> 01:10:24,067
a pulse in the
eternal mind, no less,

1028
01:10:25,500 --> 01:10:29,033
gives somewhere back the
thoughts by England given,

1029
01:10:30,333 --> 01:10:34,767
her sights and sounds,
dreams happy as her day

1030
01:10:36,067 --> 01:10:39,833
and laughter learned of
friends and gentleness

1031
01:10:41,033 --> 01:10:45,733
in hearts at peace,
under an English heaven.

1032
01:11:24,167 --> 01:11:27,833
[dramatic orchestral music]

1033
01:12:01,233 --> 01:12:04,200
[explosions booming]

1034
01:12:05,067 --> 01:12:07,567
[men barking]

1035
01:12:09,267 --> 01:12:10,600
[men shouting]

1036
01:12:10,733 --> 01:12:13,233
[guns firing]

1037
01:12:18,533 --> 01:12:22,200
[dramatic orchestral music]

1038
01:12:34,600 --> 01:12:37,433
[whistle blowing]

1039
01:12:48,267 --> 01:12:51,067
[train chugging]

1040
01:12:57,567 --> 01:13:00,933
[train whistle blowing]

1041
01:13:31,433 --> 01:13:32,900
[Peggy] Excuse me,
have you seen this man?

1042
01:13:33,067 --> 01:13:34,067
Sergeant Ted Grimes?

1043
01:13:34,133 --> 01:13:35,100
- I'm sorry.
- Or my brothers?

1044
01:13:35,233 --> 01:13:36,200
Herbert and Chad Batterbee?

1045
01:13:36,333 --> 01:13:37,400
Posted missing after Gallipoli?

1046
01:13:37,533 --> 01:13:38,867
- All right there.
- Sergeant Ted Grimes?

1047
01:13:39,067 --> 01:13:41,533
Excuse me, have you seen this
man, Sergeant Ted Grimes?

1048
01:13:41,667 --> 01:13:43,567
Excuse me, have you seen this
man, Sergeant Ted Grimes?

1049
01:13:43,700 --> 01:13:44,733
He's my husband.

1050
01:13:44,867 --> 01:13:45,933
- No, I'm sorry, love.
- Or my brothers?

1051
01:13:46,067 --> 01:13:47,500
Herbert and Chad Batterbee?

1052
01:13:47,633 --> 01:13:49,133
Posted missing after Gallipoli?

1053
01:13:49,267 --> 01:13:50,733
- Any news?
- Nothing so far, Mr. Arthur.

1054
01:13:50,867 --> 01:13:51,667
Have you got a photograph?

1055
01:13:51,800 --> 01:13:52,967
[Luke] Sergeant Ted Grimes?

1056
01:13:53,100 --> 01:13:54,567
You got no chance there, son.

1057
01:13:54,700 --> 01:13:56,533
Would there be any
news of Captain

1058
01:13:56,667 --> 01:13:59,533
Frank Beck's
Sandringham Company?

1059
01:13:59,667 --> 01:14:00,700
Captain Beck?

1060
01:14:00,833 --> 01:14:01,867
Sandringham?

1061
01:14:02,067 --> 01:14:03,067
You want the Dereham
lot for that.

1062
01:14:03,200 --> 01:14:04,633
Just down the line
from them, they were.

1063
01:14:04,767 --> 01:14:05,533
- They saw them go.
- Go?

1064
01:14:05,667 --> 01:14:06,533
Where'd they go?

1065
01:14:06,667 --> 01:14:07,800
Into the mist.

1066
01:14:07,933 --> 01:14:10,067
No good asking me, you
want the Dereham lot.

1067
01:14:10,133 --> 01:14:11,300
They'll be drinking by now.

1068
01:14:11,433 --> 01:14:12,333
Try The Wheatsheaf.

1069
01:14:12,467 --> 01:14:13,467
The Wheatsheaf!

1070
01:14:13,600 --> 01:14:14,300
Come on, Luke.

1071
01:14:14,433 --> 01:14:15,267
You with us, Mr. Arthur?

1072
01:14:15,400 --> 01:14:16,200
Oh, I'm due back.

1073
01:14:16,333 --> 01:14:17,433
I've got the accounts to do.

1074
01:14:17,567 --> 01:14:19,567
Mrs. Grimes, Mrs. Grime!

1075
01:14:22,067 --> 01:14:23,467
Have this.

1076
01:14:23,600 --> 01:14:26,100
You might need to buy a drink.

1077
01:14:26,933 --> 01:14:28,267
[train whistle blows]

1078
01:14:28,400 --> 01:14:31,533
"I regret to inform you that
of about two hundred men"

1079
01:14:31,667 --> 01:14:35,533
"missing to date only
seven are classified"

1080
01:14:35,667 --> 01:14:38,967
"by the War Office
as prisoners of war."

1081
01:14:39,100 --> 01:14:42,067
"None of them is from
the Sandringham Company."

1082
01:14:43,067 --> 01:14:44,067
It's not enough, Georgie.

1083
01:14:44,200 --> 01:14:45,800
We are not doing enough.

1084
01:14:45,933 --> 01:14:47,767
[Mary] Pappa,
Grandmamma, the tree.

1085
01:14:47,900 --> 01:14:49,633
Oh, the tree.

1086
01:14:49,767 --> 01:14:51,133
[Nanny] George.

1087
01:14:51,267 --> 01:14:54,133
[George] What a splendid
sight it is, magnificent!

1088
01:14:54,267 --> 01:14:55,600
How can we look at a tree?

1089
01:14:55,733 --> 01:14:56,967
How can we celebrate?

1090
01:14:57,100 --> 01:14:58,167
Of course we may look at a tree.

1091
01:14:58,300 --> 01:14:59,867
We do not fail in our duty.

1092
01:15:00,067 --> 01:15:01,700
Of course, we have
our regulation

1093
01:15:01,833 --> 01:15:03,300
three inches of
water in our baths.

1094
01:15:03,433 --> 01:15:04,867
Do you imagine I don't grieve?

1095
01:15:05,067 --> 01:15:07,967
That my heart doesn't
break at the slaughter?

1096
01:15:08,100 --> 01:15:09,633
And not just for our own men?

1097
01:15:13,200 --> 01:15:15,500
We put our trust
in our generals.

1098
01:15:16,933 --> 01:15:18,400
And we show the people,
especially those who have

1099
01:15:18,533 --> 01:15:22,300
lost their loved ones, that
we do not countenance defeat.

1100
01:15:22,433 --> 01:15:24,600
So what do you want, then?

1101
01:15:24,733 --> 01:15:26,867
The tale of our brave
assault on Hun and Turk?

1102
01:15:27,067 --> 01:15:28,400
You saw the Sandringham men?

1103
01:15:28,533 --> 01:15:30,600
My husband was with
them, and my brothers.

1104
01:15:30,733 --> 01:15:32,700
All we've been told
is missing in action.

1105
01:15:32,833 --> 01:15:34,800
Luck of the draw, missing.

1106
01:15:36,067 --> 01:15:37,267
We reckon there's
a load of missing

1107
01:15:37,400 --> 01:15:40,067
'cause they can't own
up to 25,000 dead.

1108
01:15:40,200 --> 01:15:41,833
British, that is.

1109
01:15:41,967 --> 01:15:43,833
There were thousands of
Aussies and Kiwis, too.

1110
01:15:43,967 --> 01:15:44,833
Dead?

1111
01:15:44,967 --> 01:15:45,767
You know they're dead?

1112
01:15:45,900 --> 01:15:48,733
No, no, I'm not saying that.

1113
01:15:49,900 --> 01:15:51,567
Please, just tell
me what you saw.

1114
01:15:55,067 --> 01:15:57,167
There was a mist that came down,

1115
01:15:57,300 --> 01:15:59,633
the mist and them clouds
with the queer shapes,

1116
01:16:01,100 --> 01:16:04,433
Very thick to the east of the
line, where your men were.

1117
01:16:04,567 --> 01:16:06,667
[Lloyd] You heard of
the Angel of Mons?

1118
01:16:06,800 --> 01:16:08,500
No, no, I haven't.

1119
01:16:08,633 --> 01:16:13,633
Terrible slaughter at
Mons, same as for us.

1120
01:16:15,700 --> 01:16:17,867
This mighty angel
came into the sky

1121
01:16:19,067 --> 01:16:20,533
to gather up the
men as they fell.

1122
01:16:21,733 --> 01:16:22,433
What?

1123
01:16:22,567 --> 01:16:23,567
What are you telling me?

1124
01:16:23,700 --> 01:16:25,400
There was no angel at Gallipoli,

1125
01:16:27,367 --> 01:16:30,333
only the mist and the
clouds that came down.

1126
01:16:32,233 --> 01:16:36,500
That's what took the Sandringham
men and Captain Beck.

1127
01:16:39,167 --> 01:16:41,467
You know Captain
Beck around here, eh?

1128
01:16:41,600 --> 01:16:43,133
[men grumbling]

1129
01:16:43,267 --> 01:16:46,467
He was a fine man
and a good man.

1130
01:16:48,300 --> 01:16:53,300
He led them, oh, straight
back like a ramrod, he had.

1131
01:16:56,333 --> 01:17:00,600
What a company,
best in the line.

1132
01:17:04,367 --> 01:17:06,367
He was making for a
stretch of woodland,

1133
01:17:08,433 --> 01:17:10,533
but before he could
get amongst the trees,

1134
01:17:12,367 --> 01:17:13,533
this mist came down.

1135
01:17:16,067 --> 01:17:21,067
They'd all gone, all of them,

1136
01:17:22,333 --> 01:17:23,333
never seen again.

1137
01:17:41,733 --> 01:17:43,900
It's now the talk of
the village, ma'am.

1138
01:17:44,067 --> 01:17:45,367
We were there this morning.

1139
01:17:45,500 --> 01:17:47,167
[Alexandra] A mist, you say?

1140
01:17:47,300 --> 01:17:48,733
Or a golden cloud?

1141
01:17:48,867 --> 01:17:50,933
We don't know what
to make of it, ma'am.

1142
01:17:51,067 --> 01:17:51,867
I know what to make of it.

1143
01:17:52,067 --> 01:17:53,133
It's drunken soldiers' talk!

1144
01:17:53,267 --> 01:17:54,167
Peggy!

1145
01:17:54,300 --> 01:17:55,767
Please excuse her, ma'am.

1146
01:17:55,900 --> 01:17:57,367
It's not just in the village.

1147
01:17:57,500 --> 01:18:01,067
It's all over, ma'am, in
the pubs, the markets.

1148
01:18:01,133 --> 01:18:02,067
I don't mind saying that my wife

1149
01:18:02,200 --> 01:18:04,267
and I take some comfort from it.

1150
01:18:04,400 --> 01:18:06,367
There's often comfort
in soldiers' tales.

1151
01:18:06,500 --> 01:18:08,300
Oh, it is cruel to
allow such stories

1152
01:18:08,433 --> 01:18:11,267
to circulate, ma'am,
cruel and vulgar.

1153
01:18:11,400 --> 01:18:12,633
What if it were to
get into the papers?

1154
01:18:12,767 --> 01:18:14,467
It's all lies, wicked lies.

1155
01:18:14,600 --> 01:18:17,233
There's no evidence that
the men are dead, ma'am.

1156
01:18:17,367 --> 01:18:20,067
There's not a single report
from a fellow soldier

1157
01:18:20,200 --> 01:18:23,067
nor a single
possession returned.

1158
01:18:24,433 --> 01:18:27,900
Perhaps, this mist that's
spoken of prevented any view

1159
01:18:28,067 --> 01:18:30,667
at all of their
engagement with the enemy.

1160
01:18:30,800 --> 01:18:33,200
I believe that many of
them, most of them could

1161
01:18:33,333 --> 01:18:36,067
be in prison, now,
behind German lines.

1162
01:18:36,167 --> 01:18:38,767
And do you believe in the
hand of God, Mrs. Beck?

1163
01:18:40,200 --> 01:18:44,267
I believe it's necessary to
keep hope alive, Lady Frances.

1164
01:18:44,400 --> 01:18:46,433
The estate could not
function without it.

1165
01:18:48,967 --> 01:18:52,300
Well, we need more than
ever to know the truth,

1166
01:18:52,433 --> 01:18:53,633
which will be a long time coming

1167
01:18:53,767 --> 01:18:56,167
from the War Office,
understandably.

1168
01:18:57,067 --> 01:18:59,100
I shall make other inquiries.

1169
01:19:00,600 --> 01:19:04,700
In the meantime, we must
find comfort where we can.

1170
01:19:04,833 --> 01:19:05,933
But you don't agree
with it, ma'am!

1171
01:19:06,067 --> 01:19:07,100
You can't!

1172
01:19:07,233 --> 01:19:09,167
- You've just joined the show!
- Peggy!

1173
01:19:09,300 --> 01:19:10,067
I know what you really think!

1174
01:19:10,133 --> 01:19:11,200
I've heard you talk!

1175
01:19:11,333 --> 01:19:13,133
You think the war's
a damn disgrace!

1176
01:19:13,267 --> 01:19:15,067
Peggy, what are you doing?

1177
01:19:15,167 --> 01:19:15,900
[Peggy screams]

1178
01:19:16,067 --> 01:19:16,800
Peggy!

1179
01:19:16,933 --> 01:19:19,933
[Peggy whimpering]

1180
01:19:20,067 --> 01:19:21,367
Peggy, where are you going?

1181
01:19:21,500 --> 01:19:22,167
Come back here!

1182
01:19:22,300 --> 01:19:24,200
You should be working!

1183
01:19:26,167 --> 01:19:27,800
I'm most dreadfully
sorry, ma'am.

1184
01:19:27,933 --> 01:19:29,233
One makes allowances.

1185
01:19:31,267 --> 01:19:33,067
May I wish you good
afternoon, ma'am?

1186
01:19:33,167 --> 01:19:34,600
A word first, Mrs. Beck.

1187
01:19:47,800 --> 01:19:52,800
I wish to commend you for
your courage and your dignity.

1188
01:19:53,867 --> 01:19:54,867
Ma'am?

1189
01:19:56,100 --> 01:19:58,933
I'm painfully aware that
you would have your husband

1190
01:19:59,067 --> 01:20:02,400
beside you now had I
not urged him to go.

1191
01:20:10,833 --> 01:20:11,867
The man who stayed behind would

1192
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:13,633
not have been my husband, ma'am.

1193
01:20:15,267 --> 01:20:20,267
He'd have been someone
else, someone destroyed.

1194
01:20:22,200 --> 01:20:23,267
He lived...

1195
01:20:25,300 --> 01:20:26,600
He lives for the estate.

1196
01:20:28,300 --> 01:20:30,733
He lives to serve you, ma'am.

1197
01:20:36,200 --> 01:20:39,033
I shall continue my
efforts with that in mind.

1198
01:20:43,700 --> 01:20:48,667
- [dramatic orchestral music]
- [Peggy sobbing]

1199
01:21:05,533 --> 01:21:08,200
[door knocking]

1200
01:21:16,400 --> 01:21:19,300
I've seen the way
you look at me.

1201
01:21:24,367 --> 01:21:26,767
[door slams]

1202
01:21:31,467 --> 01:21:35,233
[both smooching and panting]

1203
01:21:53,400 --> 01:21:55,367
You want this?

1204
01:21:55,500 --> 01:21:56,733
I don't know.

1205
01:21:56,867 --> 01:21:58,633
I don't care.

1206
01:21:58,767 --> 01:22:01,367
[both moaning]

1207
01:22:11,067 --> 01:22:14,467
[reflective piano music]

1208
01:22:51,267 --> 01:22:54,333
[people socialising]

1209
01:23:07,933 --> 01:23:11,300
[doctor speaks in German]

1210
01:23:11,433 --> 01:23:13,633
You, you are lucky, you know,

1211
01:23:13,767 --> 01:23:15,667
to have been picked
up by the Germans.

1212
01:23:17,067 --> 01:23:18,333
This is good.

1213
01:23:18,467 --> 01:23:19,800
You have more
operations to come,

1214
01:23:19,933 --> 01:23:22,067
but there's a backlog,
you understand?

1215
01:23:22,967 --> 01:23:24,167
The wounded keep coming.

1216
01:23:59,067 --> 01:24:01,833
[metal creaking]

1217
01:24:10,600 --> 01:24:13,700
[Kamal] This place is not
suitable for a burial ground.

1218
01:24:13,833 --> 01:24:14,867
[Pierrepoint] Today, I'm not

1219
01:24:15,067 --> 01:24:16,167
wearing my War Graves
Commission hat,

1220
01:24:16,300 --> 01:24:19,933
Professor Demiriz,
ah, that is to say...

1221
01:24:20,067 --> 01:24:23,367
Yes, yes, Mr.
Pierrepoint Edwards,

1222
01:24:23,500 --> 01:24:26,233
I am familiar with the
notion of wearing a hat.

1223
01:24:26,367 --> 01:24:29,633
Today, you wear the hat of
Queen Alexandra's investigator.

1224
01:24:30,800 --> 01:24:31,733
Do you know about
the cloud that came

1225
01:24:31,867 --> 01:24:33,467
down on the day of the battle?

1226
01:24:33,600 --> 01:24:34,433
The miracle?

1227
01:24:35,567 --> 01:24:38,300
Of course, everyone
knows about it.

1228
01:24:38,433 --> 01:24:40,200
You, of course,
don't believe it?

1229
01:24:40,333 --> 01:24:42,367
I believe an entire company
of soldiers disappeared

1230
01:24:42,500 --> 01:24:44,567
and has never been
heard of since.

1231
01:24:44,700 --> 01:24:47,967
Dead, Mr. Pierrepoint Edwards,

1232
01:24:48,100 --> 01:24:50,533
among the unknown thousands.

1233
01:24:50,667 --> 01:24:51,467
What else?

1234
01:24:51,600 --> 01:24:52,867
You waste your time.

1235
01:24:53,067 --> 01:24:55,933
Is it true that your countrymen
did not take prisoners?

1236
01:24:56,067 --> 01:24:58,700
It's true that taking
prisoners is a luxury,

1237
01:24:59,800 --> 01:25:01,533
enjoyed by economies
who can afford

1238
01:25:01,667 --> 01:25:06,633
to plan, build and maintain
prisons, and to feed prisoners.

1239
01:25:07,800 --> 01:25:09,700
And that's how you
justify a massacre?

1240
01:25:12,967 --> 01:25:14,833
What did you, the
British, expect?

1241
01:25:16,067 --> 01:25:17,700
You were the invaders.

1242
01:25:19,133 --> 01:25:22,867
Before you speak of
massacre, speak of betrayal,

1243
01:25:24,200 --> 01:25:26,933
and see if the blame
doesn't lie closer to home.

1244
01:25:28,567 --> 01:25:32,233
[dramatic orchestral music]

1245
01:25:33,633 --> 01:25:38,233
Lunacy, the whole campaign,
thousands upon thousands

1246
01:25:38,367 --> 01:25:41,400
killed or wounded
and for nothing.

1247
01:25:44,133 --> 01:25:45,200
Strike tents.

1248
01:25:47,567 --> 01:25:50,300
If we leave now, we can be
back at the bay before dark.

1249
01:25:52,833 --> 01:25:55,833
A wise decision, Mr.
Pierrepoint Edwards.

1250
01:25:57,733 --> 01:25:59,100
Leave the miracle intact.

1251
01:26:01,500 --> 01:26:03,400
And what will you
tell Queen Alexandra?

1252
01:26:04,500 --> 01:26:06,067
She has sent others before you.

1253
01:26:07,500 --> 01:26:09,067
Even during the war, the
American Ambassador came.

1254
01:26:09,167 --> 01:26:10,933
[man exclaims]

1255
01:26:11,067 --> 01:26:15,500
[Kamal speaking in
foreign language]

1256
01:26:42,300 --> 01:26:44,967
[clock ticking]

1257
01:26:48,233 --> 01:26:50,133
Sandringham time, Captain Beck?

1258
01:26:51,300 --> 01:26:53,967
Local time, I've
put the past behind.

1259
01:27:01,500 --> 01:27:04,200
All right, we make for
the woods in the west

1260
01:27:04,333 --> 01:27:06,367
and then take the
village if we can.

1261
01:27:06,500 --> 01:27:08,167
All right, carry on.

1262
01:27:10,567 --> 01:27:13,067
Men, have Sandringham
in your hearts.

1263
01:27:13,133 --> 01:27:14,900
We fight today so
we can return there

1264
01:27:15,067 --> 01:27:17,733
and take up our work again
with dignity and respect.

1265
01:27:21,200 --> 01:27:23,433
Before we left home, I
made a promise to you,

1266
01:27:24,633 --> 01:27:26,333
a promise that I
would be like a father

1267
01:27:26,467 --> 01:27:29,400
and protect you from any
dangers that would beset us.

1268
01:27:30,867 --> 01:27:33,733
I realise now that that was a
promise that I couldn't keep.

1269
01:27:37,333 --> 01:27:42,333
I'm not your father
but I am your brother.

1270
01:27:44,867 --> 01:27:48,800
And all that I can promise
in brotherhood is that I will

1271
01:27:48,933 --> 01:27:53,067
stand by your side and
face what you have to face.

1272
01:27:54,367 --> 01:27:56,100
[men muttering]

1273
01:27:56,233 --> 01:27:58,133
- Well done, sir.
- Thank you, sir.

1274
01:27:58,267 --> 01:28:01,333
[George whimpering]

1275
01:28:06,367 --> 01:28:09,233
All right, lad,
I'll be with you.

1276
01:28:17,100 --> 01:28:19,667
My fiancee admires you, Doctor.

1277
01:28:21,167 --> 01:28:22,800
I can't think why.

1278
01:28:22,933 --> 01:28:26,067
If I live, I shall
break our engagement.

1279
01:28:27,933 --> 01:28:30,900
If you live, be kind to her.

1280
01:28:33,133 --> 01:28:34,833
You almost make me want to live.

1281
01:28:39,767 --> 01:28:41,600
I'm sorry about Needham.

1282
01:29:00,567 --> 01:29:02,200
Evelyn, take your
brother's hand.

1283
01:29:03,900 --> 01:29:05,600
He doesn't want it, Uncle Frank.

1284
01:29:06,933 --> 01:29:09,067
You don't want it.

1285
01:29:09,167 --> 01:29:12,400
You don't want that he's the
eldest and in line for my job.

1286
01:29:12,533 --> 01:29:14,667
You don't want the farm
because he gets the estate.

1287
01:29:14,800 --> 01:29:16,900
You're choked up
with not wanting.

1288
01:29:17,800 --> 01:29:19,067
Now, let it go.

1289
01:29:33,967 --> 01:29:35,567
Here's your five bob, Herbert.

1290
01:29:37,700 --> 01:29:38,700
Keep it.

1291
01:29:39,900 --> 01:29:41,700
I'd only do something
stupid with it.

1292
01:29:41,833 --> 01:29:42,933
You'd get a couple
of Scouse tarts

1293
01:29:43,067 --> 01:29:44,633
for that and change over.

1294
01:29:45,833 --> 01:29:47,767
'Course, you'd get
the clap as well.

1295
01:29:50,067 --> 01:29:52,267
[Chad] Say a prayer for us, sir.

1296
01:29:52,400 --> 01:29:54,800
[dramatic orchestral music]

1297
01:29:54,933 --> 01:29:56,800
I'll give you the
soldier's prayer.

1298
01:30:02,933 --> 01:30:06,500
Dear Lord, you know
what I must do this day.

1299
01:30:07,967 --> 01:30:12,133
If I forget thee,
do not forget me.

1300
01:30:13,567 --> 01:30:14,267
Amen.

1301
01:30:14,400 --> 01:30:15,400
[Soldiers] Amen.

1302
01:30:18,700 --> 01:30:21,300
All right, carry on, Sergeant.

1303
01:30:21,433 --> 01:30:24,767
[Sergeant] On your
feet, fix bayonets!

1304
01:30:25,933 --> 01:30:29,100
[bayonets clattering]

1305
01:30:32,533 --> 01:30:35,133
[men whooping]

1306
01:30:39,400 --> 01:30:42,067

[whistle blows]

1308
01:31:06,067 --> 01:31:08,867
[engine rumbling]

1309
01:31:29,333 --> 01:31:30,767
You see in what high regard

1310
01:31:30,900 --> 01:31:33,833
our Sandringham men
were held, Mr. Edwards?

1311
01:31:33,967 --> 01:31:35,367
Indeed, sir.

1312
01:31:35,500 --> 01:31:37,367
And Beck, as their leader?

1313
01:31:38,867 --> 01:31:40,800
I wanted him to stay
at home, of course,

1314
01:31:40,933 --> 01:31:44,600
but there you are,
he's immortalised now.

1315
01:31:45,833 --> 01:31:47,333
A remarkable man.

1316
01:31:47,467 --> 01:31:51,100
And what have you to tell
us, Mr. Pierrepoint Edwards?

1317
01:31:51,233 --> 01:31:53,633
We heard several versions
of the story, ma'am.

1318
01:31:57,067 --> 01:31:58,067
However...

1319
01:31:59,533 --> 01:32:01,233
I hope you do not doubt what

1320
01:32:01,367 --> 01:32:03,367
we were told by the War Office.

1321
01:32:03,500 --> 01:32:06,400
I believe, ma'am,
that, at the time,

1322
01:32:06,533 --> 01:32:09,700
it was advisable for
the War Office to give

1323
01:32:09,833 --> 01:32:13,333
the most acceptable
interpretation of what happened.

1324
01:32:13,467 --> 01:32:14,967
And I'm sure you do not intend

1325
01:32:15,100 --> 01:32:18,767
to distress my mother,
Mr. Pierrepoint Edwards.

1326
01:32:18,900 --> 01:32:20,700
And is it acceptable to claim

1327
01:32:20,833 --> 01:32:23,200
that the men simply disappeared?

1328
01:32:23,333 --> 01:32:24,667
What is the alternative?

1329
01:32:25,633 --> 01:32:28,400
Ma'am, please come and see.

1330
01:32:35,533 --> 01:32:38,067
Oh, his poor face.

1331
01:32:40,667 --> 01:32:43,933
[dramatic orchestral music]

1332
01:32:44,067 --> 01:32:45,300
It's Grimes.

1333
01:32:46,933 --> 01:32:48,700
He's come back to us!

1334
01:32:50,067 --> 01:32:51,067
Could it be?

1335
01:32:53,100 --> 01:32:56,567
Is it possible they will
all come back to us?

We're behind Turkish lines, sir.

1357
01:35:26,233 --> 01:35:27,367
I know we are.

1358
01:35:27,500 --> 01:35:29,100
I'm well aware of
that, Mr. Radley.

1359
01:35:29,233 --> 01:35:30,900
We can't turn back now.

1360
01:35:31,067 --> 01:35:34,400
Head for the building
that's our cover.

Get to the cover!

01:35:38,100 --> 01:35:39,933
You'll be safe, go on!

1365
01:35:42,100 --> 01:35:44,233
The building is our objective!

1366
01:35:44,367 --> 01:35:45,800
Take cover there!

[Kamal] They fought like heroes.

1368
01:35:56,933 --> 01:35:58,500
Is it necessary to go on?

1369

it is necessary.

Get up old chap!

Come on, please!

He's gone!

01:36:18,633 --> 01:36:20,933
What are we gonna tell
Mother, Uncle Frank?

1378
01:36:21,067 --> 01:36:22,467
Oh, my boy.

1379
01:36:22,600 --> 01:36:23,467
What are we gonna say?

1380
01:36:23,600 --> 01:36:25,333
All right, all right, come on.

1381
01:36:25,467 --> 01:36:29,600
Sergeant, help get
these two men to cover!

1382
01:36:29,733 --> 01:36:32,500
Come along, get
undercover, move!

Come on!

Come on, boys.

1389

Come on!

I lay there.

01:40:01,800 --> 01:40:04,200
And then the Jerries found
me and patched me up.

1412
01:40:07,267 --> 01:40:09,900
I can't say I was treated
bad in the hospital, ma'am.

1413
01:40:11,933 --> 01:40:14,867
Do you know of any other
prisoners from Sandringham?

1414
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:20,100
No, no, ma'am, and
there'll be none now.

1415
01:40:20,233 --> 01:40:22,067
I was in the last
batch coming back.

1416
01:40:24,167 --> 01:40:25,233
I do know what happened to them,

1417
01:40:25,367 --> 01:40:27,900
though, to Mr.
Beck and the rest.

1418
01:40:29,700 --> 01:40:31,033
You do?

1419
01:40:31,167 --> 01:40:32,967
You mean you haven't
heard, ma'am?

1420
01:40:34,000 --> 01:40:35,100
It was famous.

1421
01:40:35,233 --> 01:40:36,967
All the prisoners
talked about it.

1422
01:40:37,100 --> 01:40:39,267
[George] Tell us what
you know, Grimes.

1423
01:40:41,267 --> 01:40:45,267
Well, it's a bit of
a miracle, isn't it?

1424
01:40:48,033 --> 01:40:49,767
They went over the
top that morning,

1425
01:40:49,900 --> 01:40:51,333
[dramatic orchestral music]

1426
01:40:51,467 --> 01:40:53,507
Captain Beck leading, and
all of them in good heart.

1427
01:40:54,833 --> 01:40:57,233
It seems there was
low-lying cloud,

1428
01:40:57,367 --> 01:41:01,733
massing since the night before,
and, as they pressed on,

1429
01:41:02,900 --> 01:41:06,500
the cloud, well, it came
down and covered them.

1430
01:41:08,500 --> 01:41:10,367
It drew them in
as if God himself

1431
01:41:10,500 --> 01:41:11,967
was wrapping it 'round them.

1432
01:41:15,667 --> 01:41:17,700
And that was the last
anyone saw of them.

1433
01:41:21,467 --> 01:41:24,200
I tell you, ma'am, I
shall miss them all

1434
01:41:24,333 --> 01:41:26,600
for the rest of my days,
but I can't grieve for them.

1435
01:41:26,733 --> 01:41:30,067
[Lady Frances whimpers]

1436
01:41:36,067 --> 01:41:38,533
If you'll please me,
ma'am, I must find my wife.

1437
01:41:40,733 --> 01:41:43,667
You know she's no
longer at Sandringham?

1438
01:41:43,800 --> 01:41:45,100
Mother says she
did something bad,

1439
01:41:45,233 --> 01:41:46,433
but I'll not believe it.

1440
01:41:47,500 --> 01:41:48,767
She'll have had a reason.

1441
01:41:49,933 --> 01:41:50,967
I have to see her.

1442
01:41:53,967 --> 01:41:56,433
Lady Frances will
send for the trap

1443
01:41:56,567 --> 01:41:57,900
to take you to the village.

1444
01:41:59,100 --> 01:42:01,933
Before that, let
us hear first what

1445
01:42:03,067 --> 01:42:05,400
Mr. Pierrepoint
Edwards has to say.

1446
01:42:06,967 --> 01:42:10,067
He knows more of the
truth than all of us.

1447
01:42:10,167 --> 01:42:12,300
Mother, dear, this
isn't appropriate.

1448
01:42:12,433 --> 01:42:15,067
It is in all our
interests to find out

1449
01:42:15,200 --> 01:42:19,667
as much as we can,
Georgie, even if it means

1450
01:42:19,800 --> 01:42:23,467
Grimes losing
something of his story.

1451
01:42:42,100 --> 01:42:45,367
I'm very much afraid, ma'am,
that I have nothing to add.

1452
01:42:52,467 --> 01:42:55,800
Nothing, Mr.
Pierrepoint Edwards?

1453
01:42:58,200 --> 01:43:02,967
Nothing, ma'am, except this.

1454
01:43:07,833 --> 01:43:09,867
I bought it from
a Turkish officer

1455
01:43:10,067 --> 01:43:12,167
who says he found it
on the battlefield.

1456
01:43:12,300 --> 01:43:14,567
There is a trade
in these things.

1457
01:43:31,667 --> 01:43:35,067
[Alexandra] Tell Mrs. Grimes
she's welcome to return here

1458
01:43:35,167 --> 01:43:37,967
with you, if you
can persuade her.

1459
01:43:38,100 --> 01:43:40,600
Mother, that is hardly proper.

1460
01:43:41,800 --> 01:43:44,667
Please tell her I
would welcome her.

1461
01:43:46,167 --> 01:43:47,167
Ma'am.

1462
01:43:56,233 --> 01:43:57,667
Do you think we may safely build

1463
01:43:57,800 --> 01:44:02,400
our memorials now, Mr.
Pierrepoint Edwards?

1464
01:44:07,800 --> 01:44:09,100
Yes, ma'am, I do.

1465
01:44:11,533 --> 01:44:14,367
[engine rumbling]

1466
01:44:17,533 --> 01:44:21,200
[dramatic orchestral music]

1467
01:44:42,067 --> 01:44:44,700
[clock ticking]

1468
01:45:31,633 --> 01:45:36,633
- [whistle blowing]
- [dramatic orchestral music]

1469
01:45:55,800 --> 01:45:57,300
[Frederick] "The
warrior sank in the dust"

1470
01:45:57,433 --> 01:45:59,733
"and his armour fell around him."

1471
01:45:59,867 --> 01:46:02,100
"Blood-stained, the
gold of his hair."

1472
01:46:03,333 --> 01:46:05,567
"He is as a handsome
tree that stands"

1473
01:46:05,700 --> 01:46:09,367
"against each blast of
wind and blossoms thickly"

1474
01:46:09,500 --> 01:46:14,500
"with white flowers, until
there comes, suddenly,"

1475
01:46:15,867 --> 01:46:19,567
"a wind so fierce that the
tree is torn up from its roots,"

1476
01:46:20,967 --> 01:46:23,867
"and is laid out, its whole
length, upon the earth."

1477
01:46:24,067 --> 01:46:27,667
[dramatic orchestral music]

1478
01:46:59,300 --> 01:47:02,167
[people cheering]

1479
01:47:53,733 --> 01:47:57,467
[dramatic orchestral music]
