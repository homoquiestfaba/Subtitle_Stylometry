You know, there is a strange beauty
the landscape here.

00:00:34,834 --> 00:00:36,699
How long have
stay here?

5
00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:38,230
I do not know.

6
00:00:38,338 --> 00:00:39,828
Ask Einstein there.

7
00:00:41,908 --> 00:00:43,273
Can not find
the problem.

8
00:00:43,510 --> 00:00:44,875
We seek
throughout the code.

00:00:44,944 --> 00:00:46,343
Everything seems to be working
perfectly.

10
00:00:46,413 --> 00:00:48,643
Well, you're wrong
or we would not be here.

11
00:00:48,815 --> 00:00:50,976
Then there is a problem.
We must find Io.

12
00:00:52,285 --> 00:00:53,582
Try the radio system.

13
00:00:53,653 --> 00:00:54,585
I tried to e. ..

PROXIMITY ALERT
My god.

20
00:01:11,271 --> 00:01:13,330

- Is. Very close!

Glad you have achieved.

24

He wants to speak to you alone.

00:03:46,292 --> 00:03:47,919
Should see it, sir.

Hold, please.

29
00:03:56,269 --> 00:03:57,361
You can take this
and give me a minute, please?

30
00:03:57,503 --> 00:03:58,367
Yes, sir.

31
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:21,292
Alpha 4, I need to report every
hours about what is happening there.

32
00:04:21,594 --> 00:04:22,822
Number one priority.

33
00:04:23,229 --> 00:04:25,629
Do not compromise our position
under any pretext.

34
00:04:25,965 --> 00:04:29,526
Delete all the transmission signals
and keep away from the communicator group.

35
00:04:30,036 --> 00:04:31,230
Got it?

36
00:04:31,638 --> 00:04:32,764
Good

37
00:04:36,709 --> 00:04:37,698
Stacey?

38
00:04:42,949 --> 00:04:45,440
- Sir?
- It will take longer than I thought.

39
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:47,378
Replace my lunch for two ...

40
00:04:47,453 --> 00:04:48,784
and pass me
all possible information ...

41
00:04:48,855 --> 00:04:51,255
about the group
put the general on the ground.

42
00:04:51,324 --> 00:04:53,224
And anything else
relevant to the project.

43
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:54,555
- Yes, sir.
- Thanks.

Colonel.

46
00:05:11,344 --> 00:05:12,402
Sit.

47
00:05:12,745 --> 00:05:14,212
Thank you, sir.

48
00:05:16,783 --> 00:05:19,251
One of the pleasures in life úItimos,
son.

49
00:05:19,786 --> 00:05:21,549
A good cigar.

50
00:05:21,954 --> 00:05:25,685
But a nice ass
're the only thing that surpasses it.

51
00:05:25,992 --> 00:05:27,323
We seem to think the same way.

52
00:05:28,494 --> 00:05:29,984
He could not contradict him,
sir.

53
00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:32,595
You. ..

54
00:05:33,266 --> 00:05:36,258
know I would not call back
after what happened.

55
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:40,237
But my orders came directly
Secretary of Defense.

56
00:05:41,007 --> 00:05:45,205
And he said he wanted
the best of my men.

57
00:05:46,646 --> 00:05:49,342
And mine is on the line, son.

58
00:05:49,882 --> 00:05:52,214
And that bastard ...

59
00:05:52,518 --> 00:05:55,681
will eat my liver
if I mess it up.

60
00:05:55,755 --> 00:05:58,451
You have always been good to me, sir.
If you call I know I'll be here.

61
00:05:58,524 --> 00:05:59,957
It has managed to recover?

62
00:06:01,461 --> 00:06:03,395
Never recovering from a war,
sir.

63
00:06:04,731 --> 00:06:08,633
All I can do is learn to live
with the new person who sees in the mirror.

64
00:06:08,701 --> 00:06:10,168
Amen, brother.

65
00:06:14,273 --> 00:06:16,798
I was in middle
a nice pair of breasts.

66
00:06:17,377 --> 00:06:19,174
Stop this nonsense.

67
00:06:20,246 --> 00:06:22,806
- Continues a beating?
- Get out!

68
00:06:22,882 --> 00:06:24,509
Pay attention to who's talking!

69
00:06:24,584 --> 00:06:27,212
Why not look where you walk,
head catfish?

70
00:06:27,954 --> 00:06:29,251
- Hi .. Charming!
- Romeo ...

71
00:06:29,322 --> 00:06:31,313
remember what happened
Iast in turn, is not it?

72
00:06:31,457 --> 00:06:32,515
- Relax, sit ...
- Wow, man.

73
00:06:32,592 --> 00:06:36,494
God is no longer full
of illegitimate children out there?

74
00:06:36,562 --> 00:06:40,896
We have two scientists
and five soldiers missing ...

75
00:06:40,967 --> 00:06:43,868
the training site
that never existed ...

76
00:06:44,871 --> 00:06:46,839
- If they understand me.
- Yes, sir.

77
00:06:46,906 --> 00:06:48,498
We lost contact with them.

78
00:06:48,574 --> 00:06:54,308
Now, intelligence says there is a field
terrorist training around.

79
00:06:55,615 --> 00:06:57,276
In short ...

80
00:06:57,350 --> 00:07:01,150
We want to find
and bring them back.

81
00:07:01,654 --> 00:07:02,848
What were they testing?

82
00:07:02,922 --> 00:07:05,516
Son, I think it would be
in a hole like this ...

83
00:07:05,591 --> 00:07:07,718
if privileged
with this kind of information?

84
00:07:08,261 --> 00:07:10,195
I'm not worried
with what we were testing.

85
00:07:10,263 --> 00:07:11,662
And neither should you be.

86
00:07:11,731 --> 00:07:15,360
Why do they simply
do not send a patrol common?

87
00:07:15,635 --> 00:07:17,466
Well, like I said ...

88
00:07:18,704 --> 00:07:20,399
officially
this place does not exist.

89
00:07:22,408 --> 00:07:23,807
Yes, sir.

90
00:07:23,876 --> 00:07:26,970
Anyway, what you
will do with that money?

91
00:07:27,213 --> 00:07:29,681
If I did it for money,
should have stopped after Syria.

92
00:07:30,817 --> 00:07:32,808
Let me tell you son of a bitch.

93
00:07:33,352 --> 00:07:36,617
Tequila, Mexico, and piranhas.

94
00:07:36,689 --> 00:07:38,714
There's nothing like Tijuana and tequila
face.

95
00:07:38,791 --> 00:07:40,850
Where is the damn kid
luggage?

96
00:07:40,927 --> 00:07:42,895
- Valet Parking!
- Valet Parking!

97
00:07:42,962 --> 00:07:44,623
Valet Parking!

98
00:07:44,831 --> 00:07:45,889
How much pay?

99
00:07:46,032 --> 00:07:48,899
One hundred and fifty thousand
for each of you.

100
00:07:49,268 --> 00:07:52,431
This is ten take the test.

101
00:07:54,006 --> 00:07:57,271
Special operation of the black market ...

102
00:07:57,510 --> 00:07:59,671
the Congress straight, baby.

103
00:08:00,246 --> 00:08:01,838
Do not love it?

104
00:08:02,315 --> 00:08:05,148
Well suited for this operation.

105
00:08:05,284 --> 00:08:07,275
God bless the United States, sir.

106
00:08:08,354 --> 00:08:12,450
There will be instructions
under the pillow of each.

107
00:08:12,859 --> 00:08:16,761
I'll put you and your group
a tent Asa A.

108
00:08:16,829 --> 00:08:20,731
Well, the helicopter leave the six
Ios to take up the place.

109
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:24,727
There will be a helicopter
exactly in the place of extraction ...

110
00:08:25,204 --> 00:08:30,198
exactly 24 hours after
that his feet touch the ground.

111
00:08:30,843 --> 00:08:33,311
If not there,
're better than like the place ...

112
00:08:33,379 --> 00:08:35,370
it will be your home sweet home
forever, son.

113
00:08:35,448 --> 00:08:37,507
We will have some contact
with a support group?

114
00:08:37,583 --> 00:08:39,778
I look like a fairy-of-tooth,
son?

115
00:08:39,852 --> 00:08:41,319
Look under the pillow ...

116
00:08:41,454 --> 00:08:43,217
and find nothing there.

117
00:08:43,456 --> 00:08:46,721
- You are on your own.
- It's ... It is what it seems.

118
00:08:47,927 --> 00:08:49,417
Right.
Discharged soldier.

119
00:08:50,463 --> 00:08:51,760
Thank you, sir.

120
00:08:51,831 --> 00:08:53,196
Good luck.

121
00:08:53,933 --> 00:08:55,298
Tyler?

122
00:08:56,269 --> 00:09:00,501
And if you can not cope
with this new guy who sees in the mirror?

123
00:09:01,674 --> 00:09:05,701
Well, sir. I arrange
a nice ass, a good cigar ...

124
00:09:05,778 --> 00:09:09,145
and feel sorry for myself,
because nobody gives a damn.

125
00:09:11,484 --> 00:09:12,883
4:00 HOURS

126
00:09:15,321 --> 00:09:16,185
Yes

127
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:19,915
The order has been given.

128
00:09:21,193 --> 00:09:24,219
Very well, have someone
to be our eyes on the ground.

129
00:09:24,430 --> 00:09:29,458
We will add local intelligence to
we will report the situation on the ground.

130
00:09:30,236 --> 00:09:31,601
I know, sir.

131
00:09:32,605 --> 00:09:34,664
Yes, you can count on me
to make the best decision.

132
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:38,510
Yes, we send the best, sir.

133
00:09:42,381 --> 00:09:43,905
The dragon's lair is the target.

134
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:46,581
I'm sending information now.

135
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:51,313
We receive more information
in an hour.

136
00:09:51,457 --> 00:09:54,449
Call my wife
and tell her to be a long day.

137
00:09:59,231 --> 00:10:00,960
6:00 HOURS

138
00:10:11,310 --> 00:10:13,710
Hold it there ...

139
00:10:13,946 --> 00:10:16,244
The government did not regulate
this crap as it should.

140
00:10:16,816 --> 00:10:19,250
Must be why his wife
dropped it, right?

141
00:10:19,318 --> 00:10:20,307
Change.

142
00:10:20,386 --> 00:10:21,375
That's it.

143
00:10:21,454 --> 00:10:22,546
Let me tell you ...

144
00:10:22,622 --> 00:10:25,887
I took a Viagra pill Once
and I was like He-Man.

145
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:27,619
- We carry everything?
- Yes, sir.

146
00:10:27,693 --> 00:10:29,661
- Yes, yes, Captain.
- Yes, sir.

147
00:10:29,929 --> 00:10:31,521
Good morning, Lieutenant.

148
00:10:31,664 --> 00:10:33,393
Is it?

149
00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:35,960
Each day the ground is a good day,
sir.

150
00:10:36,702 --> 00:10:38,329
Only if it is for you.

151
00:10:38,904 --> 00:10:41,372
Lord, are orders of Colonel.

152
00:10:41,774 --> 00:10:43,332
I'll need
of all identifications.

153
00:10:43,409 --> 00:10:44,876
- What was that?
- What?

154
00:10:45,745 --> 00:10:48,270
Why should I
surrender my ID?

155
00:10:50,816 --> 00:10:53,341
I want my mother
I get right, get it?

156
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:55,985
I want to be cute
in a black coffin in Knoxville.

157
00:10:56,055 --> 00:10:58,751
You do not think
bury me here in Puerto Rico.

158
00:10:58,824 --> 00:11:02,260
- I'm warning you.
- This is not Puerto Rico. Ê the Caribbean.

159
00:11:02,395 --> 00:11:03,327
Whether that is crap.

160
00:11:03,396 --> 00:11:05,261
There is only one city "chicane"
for me, man.

161
00:11:05,331 --> 00:11:06,320
Do you hear?

162
00:11:10,503 --> 00:11:11,834
Sure, boss.

163
00:11:11,971 --> 00:11:13,836
I do not care
for what happens to me there ...

164
00:11:14,407 --> 00:11:16,932
but I have to go home.
I can not give it up.

165
00:11:17,009 --> 00:11:18,670
I've opened up too much.

166
00:11:20,746 --> 00:11:22,441
Talk to the colonel and to ensure,
right?

167
00:11:22,515 --> 00:11:24,312
You have my word, sir.

168
00:11:26,986 --> 00:11:28,749
Surrender their IDs.
Order of colonel.

169
00:11:29,055 --> 00:11:30,682
Come on, sir!
This is ridiculous.

170
00:11:30,756 --> 00:11:33,224
- This is ridiculous.
- Do what I said. Come on.

171
00:11:43,836 --> 00:11:46,896
Say goodbye
those who never existed.

172
00:11:48,641 --> 00:11:50,768
Try not to get a rash
kissing that ass.

173
00:11:50,843 --> 00:11:52,435
Bureaucrat asshole.

174
00:11:52,645 --> 00:11:55,637
Good morning, Lieutenant.
Cassandra Mason, C. I.A.

175
00:11:56,749 --> 00:11:58,341
Congratulations.

176
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:02,912
Well, wherever I feel?

177
00:12:05,257 --> 00:12:07,748
Sorry,
but no women in that mission.

178
00:12:07,827 --> 00:12:09,351
Why, lieutenant.

179
00:12:09,428 --> 00:12:11,328
Girls can not play
with boys?

180
00:12:12,498 --> 00:12:14,693
Are you serious?

181
00:12:16,268 --> 00:12:17,929
Guys,
need to talk to the colonel.

182
00:12:18,003 --> 00:12:19,231
- Lord ...
- Yes, sir.

183
00:12:19,305 --> 00:12:20,294
With the colonel?

184
00:12:20,372 --> 00:12:22,397
Look, this is above it.

185
00:12:22,541 --> 00:12:24,839
Now, I'll get on that boat.

186
00:12:25,010 --> 00:12:27,911
And if I were you I would not lose
time trying to stop me.

187
00:12:29,615 --> 00:12:31,276
And why do you need?

188
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:33,409
I know you will find this
hard to believe ...

189
00:12:33,486 --> 00:12:35,215
But this is not
My first mission here.

190
00:12:35,387 --> 00:12:37,321
I know the area
better than anyone.

191
00:12:37,456 --> 00:12:40,516
Then again ...

192
00:12:40,726 --> 00:12:43,217
Wherever I sit,
Lieutenant?

193
00:12:44,797 --> 00:12:47,027
If you delay in
I will leave behind.

194
00:12:47,266 --> 00:12:48,233
Ê a promise.

195
00:12:50,836 --> 00:12:53,327
- What?
- That's it, "hermanita".

196
00:12:53,405 --> 00:12:54,667
Climb on the boat.

197
00:12:54,874 --> 00:12:57,240
For me
this is a great nonsense.

198
00:13:06,952 --> 00:13:08,351
My God.

199
00:13:09,255 --> 00:13:11,348
Choose between bad and worse.

200
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:16,189
Well, if these guys
do not resolve this ...

201
00:13:16,328 --> 00:13:17,818
nobody will.

202
00:14:31,437 --> 00:14:32,734
Come on.

203
00:15:08,807 --> 00:15:10,206
Boss!

204
00:15:18,817 --> 00:15:23,222
You bet your pee-pee
they had a painful death.

205
00:15:23,222 --> 00:15:24,348
What do you think?

206
00:15:24,857 --> 00:15:29,191
Lord, the skull appears to have been
drilled with a kind of drill.

207
00:15:30,229 --> 00:15:33,323
The internal contents of the cranial vault ...

208
00:15:33,732 --> 00:15:35,723
was removed.

209
00:15:35,801 --> 00:15:38,201
And the White House
concerned about torture.

210
00:15:39,405 --> 00:15:41,339
Do not even want to think
where did we get ourselves into.

211
00:15:41,507 --> 00:15:42,701
I'll tell you one thing.

212
00:15:42,775 --> 00:15:44,333
This was not done by a Latino.

213
00:15:46,278 --> 00:15:47,939
Where do you think will?

214
00:15:48,013 --> 00:15:49,344
Get your hands off me.

215
00:15:49,481 --> 00:15:50,914
Listen, as you
I also have a job to do.

216
00:15:50,983 --> 00:15:52,951
Really?
And that work is that?

217
00:15:53,018 --> 00:15:54,815
- I'll tell you what my job ...
- No! Let me tell you ...

218
00:15:54,887 --> 00:15:55,876
Little Miss Sunshine ...

219
00:15:55,955 --> 00:15:58,719
you will not get here
and fuck my operation.

220
00:15:58,791 --> 00:16:01,453
I do not care to know why
your government bureaucrat sent her here ...

221
00:16:01,527 --> 00:16:03,791
but now you're here,
is under my command.

222
00:16:03,862 --> 00:16:05,523
You understand?

223
00:16:06,532 --> 00:16:09,797
- I understand ...
- Just agree with the head ...

224
00:16:09,969 --> 00:16:11,561
or leave behind.

225
00:16:13,405 --> 00:16:15,805
Chief, these guys
are real killers.

226
00:16:15,941 --> 00:16:19,274
Definitely do not have the brand
terrorist training.

227
00:16:19,345 --> 00:16:21,779
Ê something much more serious.

228
00:16:21,914 --> 00:16:23,779
Chief,
I think you should see it here.

229
00:16:30,556 --> 00:16:33,252
This here
're a kind of heavy weapons.

230
00:16:33,392 --> 00:16:35,883
No A.K. 47
do that in a man.

231
00:16:35,961 --> 00:16:37,792
The sons of a bitch
are getting help from somewhere.

232
00:16:38,430 --> 00:16:40,762
I'm sure of it.

233
00:16:41,367 --> 00:16:42,857
You bet, man.

234
00:16:43,936 --> 00:16:45,301
Listen.

235
00:16:45,938 --> 00:16:48,270
If you're hiding
some information from me ...

236
00:16:48,941 --> 00:16:51,307
will regret
he was born.

237
00:16:51,443 --> 00:16:52,603
Jack ...

238
00:16:53,312 --> 00:16:55,542
search the boat,
reviste bodies.

239
00:16:55,714 --> 00:16:56,840
- Find something.
- Yes, sir.

240
00:16:56,915 --> 00:16:58,610
Jesse, keep the perimeter.

241
00:16:58,684 --> 00:17:00,515
Check for more
a victim there.

242
00:17:00,586 --> 00:17:03,487
- Yes, sir.
- Jack, when finished, burn the boat.

243
00:17:03,922 --> 00:17:05,446
It will be a pleasure, sir.

244
00:17:31,683 --> 00:17:32,911
Drugs.

245
00:17:33,252 --> 00:17:34,810
I just lost my appetite.

246
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:36,778
This must have been
a fight, though.

247
00:17:41,493 --> 00:17:43,290
Chief,
cartridges are everywhere.

248
00:17:46,031 --> 00:17:49,228
They should
have given a thousand shots.

249
00:17:49,401 --> 00:17:52,564
Lots of cartridges
but I see the bodies of the bad guys.

250
00:17:52,638 --> 00:17:56,699
- What is it?
- Chief, I do not have an answer.

251
00:17:56,775 --> 00:17:59,835
I mean,
I've never seen anything like it before.

252
00:18:01,313 --> 00:18:02,905
I know I'm not a coward ...

253
00:18:03,282 --> 00:18:06,308
but I think we were sent
into a trap, mortal.

254
00:18:06,385 --> 00:18:07,352
Look at this.

255
00:18:09,254 --> 00:18:11,518
Something you only see on TV.

256
00:18:12,224 --> 00:18:13,316
Buttercup.

257
00:18:13,392 --> 00:18:14,620
If you get too scared ...

258
00:18:14,693 --> 00:18:15,853
just grab the daddy.

259
00:18:18,330 --> 00:18:21,857
Twice in Baghdad, one year
As UN peacekeeping in Sudan

260
00:18:21,934 --> 00:18:23,526
This here is pretty easy.

261
00:18:24,203 --> 00:18:25,602
Woman gets heavy ...

262
00:18:25,671 --> 00:18:26,638
that exciting.

263
00:18:28,207 --> 00:18:29,504
I think she likes me
chief.

264
00:18:29,575 --> 00:18:30,735
Enough.

265
00:18:31,210 --> 00:18:32,370
Let's follow the trail.

266
00:18:32,444 --> 00:18:34,275
- We'll find those bastards.
- Yes, sir.

267
00:18:34,346 --> 00:18:35,313
Come on.

268
00:18:36,315 --> 00:18:37,373
Dammit ...

269
00:18:45,224 --> 00:18:46,657
More flies to lay eggs.

270
00:18:52,898 --> 00:18:53,922
Damn!

271
00:20:42,507 --> 00:20:43,735
Hit him.

272
00:21:13,272 --> 00:21:14,466
Right ...

273
00:21:15,507 --> 00:21:17,441
Colby, you get the point.

274
00:21:17,976 --> 00:21:20,536
All Others
in close formation ...

275
00:21:20,612 --> 00:21:21,909
together, right?

276
00:21:23,348 --> 00:21:25,248
- What about me?
- What about you?

277
00:21:25,317 --> 00:21:27,717
- I'm not staying here.
- Yes, you will.

278
00:21:27,986 --> 00:21:29,977
If any of these sons-of-mother
here goes ...

279
00:21:30,055 --> 00:21:32,250
you have to do is shoot them,
right?

280
00:21:34,326 --> 00:21:35,350
Excuse me.

281
00:22:06,391 --> 00:22:08,256
Jackie, Jesse, on the left.

282
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:09,793
- Colby, me.
- Yes, sir.

283
00:22:09,861 --> 00:22:11,852
The rest of the right.
Go! Go! Go!

284
00:22:11,930 --> 00:22:13,192
Go! Go!

285
00:22:45,964 --> 00:22:47,363
Cover my rear!
Move!

286
00:23:18,630 --> 00:23:19,654
Dammit ...

287
00:23:29,341 --> 00:23:31,502
Let's see what they have, guys.

288
00:23:34,846 --> 00:23:35,972
Chief.

289
00:23:36,915 --> 00:23:38,473
Chief, you have to see it.

290
00:23:43,288 --> 00:23:44,653
Son of a Mother.

291
00:23:45,757 --> 00:23:49,454
Is a request for more weapons
Department of Defense.

292
00:23:50,429 --> 00:23:52,454
Lord, this is a training manual
U.S. Army.

293
00:23:52,831 --> 00:23:53,889
What?

294
00:23:56,535 --> 00:23:58,935
These weapons are subject
U.S. Army.

295
00:23:59,704 --> 00:24:01,331
This is nonsense, sir.

296
00:24:01,540 --> 00:24:05,909
- Sir, it is absurd!
- Yes definitely absurd.

297
00:24:06,645 --> 00:24:09,341
We're training these cretins
to fight against us.

298
00:24:10,682 --> 00:24:11,979
My God ...

299
00:24:17,622 --> 00:24:20,284
I think we sent maintain
your ass back there.

300
00:24:20,525 --> 00:24:21,583
I was bored.

301
00:24:22,794 --> 00:24:23,726
Get down.

302
00:24:52,657 --> 00:24:53,681
Clear.

303
00:24:53,758 --> 00:24:55,692
- Clean.
- Clean.

304
00:25:00,532 --> 00:25:03,933
Explain to me why the government
sent us here?

305
00:25:04,202 --> 00:25:06,966
This was a mission of persecution
and destruction, is not it?

306
00:25:07,272 --> 00:25:08,500
Listen, chump.

307
00:25:09,274 --> 00:25:12,266
Your job is to shoot
and not ask questions.

308
00:25:12,344 --> 00:25:14,642
So follow your orders
and keep your mouth shut.

309
00:25:14,713 --> 00:25:17,876
Like you, bastards, they send
my men for a deadly trap?

310
00:25:17,949 --> 00:25:20,213
You know very well
that those scientists were dead.

311
00:25:20,285 --> 00:25:22,947
You sent us here
to clean up their mess.

312
00:25:24,823 --> 00:25:27,417
Won ten note, Lieutenant.

313
00:25:32,731 --> 00:25:34,528
Jack, put fire in place.

314
00:25:35,467 --> 00:25:36,491
Colby.

315
00:25:57,389 --> 00:25:58,321
Tyler?

316
00:25:58,390 --> 00:26:01,257
Now my goal is to ascertain
my men will leave here alive.

317
00:26:01,326 --> 00:26:03,294
But I have several questions
for you, ma'am.

318
00:26:03,862 --> 00:26:05,830
Have you ever thought that sometimes
there are questions whose answers ...

319
00:26:05,897 --> 00:26:09,458
- Will not really want to know.
- Not when it involves my men.

320
00:26:10,468 --> 00:26:12,197
Damn his men!

321
00:26:12,337 --> 00:26:15,272
The interest of the American government
comes first, and sometimes we ...

322
00:26:15,340 --> 00:26:18,309
- To lose to save a thousand.
- Next time ...

323
00:26:18,443 --> 00:26:20,638
if you want someone to clean up their mess,
bring somebody of your own team.

324
00:26:20,712 --> 00:26:23,476
- We are not puppets.
- Is yes.

325
00:26:23,548 --> 00:26:26,540
Whenever the U.S. government
ê say. Just like me.

326
00:26:31,256 --> 00:26:34,225
Get your hands off me.

327
00:26:40,432 --> 00:26:42,457
Gentlemen, fasten the pace.

328
00:26:46,271 --> 00:26:47,568
Colby, stand in front.

329
00:26:48,306 --> 00:26:49,705
Jesse, stay behind.

330
00:26:58,984 --> 00:27:02,613
It is. If the U.S. government
say it is. Just like me.

331
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:22,800
Jesse?

332
00:27:23,708 --> 00:27:25,300
Keep an eye on her.

333
00:27:25,710 --> 00:27:27,473
If she tries to escape ...

334
00:27:28,246 --> 00:27:29,474
shoot her.

335
00:27:30,215 --> 00:27:31,910
Okay, men, let's go.

336
00:27:39,958 --> 00:27:43,519
Do not worry "mamacita"
I'll keep an eye on your backside.

337
00:28:04,416 --> 00:28:06,145
What do you think, soldier?

338
00:28:06,551 --> 00:28:07,882
There's something there.

339
00:28:09,487 --> 00:28:11,216
Where am I looking at?

340
00:28:18,463 --> 00:28:21,455
Not sure, sir.
False alarm, I guess.

341
00:28:24,269 --> 00:28:25,702
Relax, guys.

342
00:28:27,772 --> 00:28:29,239
Let's take a break.

343
00:28:44,989 --> 00:28:46,286
Cigarette?

344
00:28:47,225 --> 00:28:48,556
Disgusting habit.

345
00:28:48,893 --> 00:28:50,417
- And you?
- Sure.

346
00:28:50,995 --> 00:28:52,963
Colby, do not be cool
all the time.

347
00:28:53,031 --> 00:28:54,362
Shut up.

348
00:28:55,366 --> 00:28:57,425
And what do you think
Miss there?

349
00:28:57,902 --> 00:29:01,303
I do not work with a lady
since I was a soldier.

350
00:29:01,439 --> 00:29:02,872
And there's more?

351
00:29:03,975 --> 00:29:05,533
She's just a girl.

352
00:29:05,877 --> 00:29:09,779
- It will weaken our group.
- You can not trust women.

353
00:29:09,848 --> 00:29:11,247
It is always emotional thing.

354
00:29:11,583 --> 00:29:14,211
Ê one month period.
They go nuts.

355
00:29:16,387 --> 00:29:18,651
Bastard, give me a sip of this here.

356
00:29:19,190 --> 00:29:20,487
Give me a cigarette.

357
00:29:28,733 --> 00:29:30,724
The bar I talked about ...

358
00:29:30,969 --> 00:29:31,936
woman is everywhere.

359
00:29:32,003 --> 00:29:33,436
You have to go with me
when we return.

360
00:29:33,638 --> 00:29:35,333
Dude, you think you fool?

361
00:29:35,473 --> 00:29:38,169
You do not know what to do
A good butt landed in his lap.

362
00:29:39,511 --> 00:29:41,843
- What is it ...
- I thought he was gay.

363
00:29:42,247 --> 00:29:43,214
Me too, man.

364
00:29:44,549 --> 00:29:47,279
Do not ask, do not count, right?

365
00:29:48,286 --> 00:29:51,687
- That was a sheep, dude.
- That does not make me gay.

366
00:29:51,756 --> 00:29:54,520
No. Just very strange.

367
00:30:01,366 --> 00:30:03,630
Diverse group that you have there ...

368
00:30:08,673 --> 00:30:10,334
They are real men.

369
00:30:10,809 --> 00:30:13,505
Of course it never came across one.

370
00:30:13,578 --> 00:30:16,638
With all those girls
who works in Washington ...

371
00:30:17,882 --> 00:30:21,579
I guess I never knew that
a real man.

372
00:30:28,993 --> 00:30:30,392
Ê ...

373
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:34,958
- What are you drinking there?
- Do you want day or night?

374
00:30:35,033 --> 00:30:37,467
- Both.
- This is how you do, sergeant.

375
00:30:37,535 --> 00:30:38,467
It has both.

376
00:30:39,037 --> 00:30:40,470
Which one is tequila?

377
00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:42,267
The right one.

378
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:46,240
I'll take a sip of it first ...

379
00:31:50,074 --> 00:31:51,439
What are you doing?

380
00:31:51,709 --> 00:31:52,971
Nothing.

381
00:31:53,878 --> 00:31:54,936
What was that?

382
00:31:56,447 --> 00:31:58,472
As I said, nothing.

383
00:32:11,362 --> 00:32:12,659
I'm sick of their attitudes.

384
00:32:23,541 --> 00:32:25,338
He saved her life.

385
00:32:32,750 --> 00:32:35,275
That's right.
I want a target.

386
00:32:38,323 --> 00:32:39,790
Ê!

387
00:32:45,897 --> 00:32:47,296
Where you going, damn?

388
00:32:48,633 --> 00:32:49,565
Where you going?

389
00:33:12,757 --> 00:33:15,317
What exactly
're looking for?

390
00:33:15,460 --> 00:33:16,688
I have no idea.

391
00:33:16,861 --> 00:33:19,796
Since I receive,
it does not matter. Right?

392
00:33:21,566 --> 00:33:23,932
You still suffers from that
post-traumatic disorder?

393
00:33:25,470 --> 00:33:26,596
Maybe.

394
00:33:26,838 --> 00:33:28,203
Want to talk about it?

395
00:33:28,272 --> 00:33:30,536
- Not really.
- You can talk to me, man.

396
00:33:30,608 --> 00:33:31,734
I'm like Dr. Phil.

397
00:33:31,909 --> 00:33:35,276
The counselor said that I have
good ears. I can hear.

398
00:33:36,314 --> 00:33:38,339
- Taken medication?
- Yes.

399
00:33:38,716 --> 00:33:39,740
Can you give me?

400
00:33:40,618 --> 00:33:42,347
Yes there are base.
I'll give you one.

401
00:33:42,420 --> 00:33:44,445
Anything
to keep it quiet, man.

402
00:33:44,522 --> 00:33:46,581
Lend me the lighter.
Lend me the lighter.

403
00:33:48,359 --> 00:33:49,951
You never stop talking?

404
00:33:51,362 --> 00:33:53,023
You'd better close your eyes.

405
00:33:53,965 --> 00:33:54,897
Get out ...

406
00:34:05,777 --> 00:34:06,971
Is dead.

407
00:34:10,715 --> 00:34:12,307
He did not even shoot.

408
00:34:14,952 --> 00:34:16,510
No. Not really.
See.

409
00:34:17,221 --> 00:34:17,983
See that?

410
00:34:18,823 --> 00:34:20,256
Ê a sniper rifle.

411
00:34:22,894 --> 00:34:24,521
We have company here.

412
00:34:24,796 --> 00:34:26,661
Looks like he's carrying
supplies.

413
00:34:27,598 --> 00:34:30,465
- There are more of them.
- Let's go back to the group. Come on.

414
00:34:30,835 --> 00:34:31,767
Come on!

415
00:35:32,396 --> 00:35:33,693
Cassandra?

416
00:35:39,437 --> 00:35:41,337
My God,
this guy is out of the brain.

417
00:35:41,472 --> 00:35:42,769
Diablo ... Coño ...

418
00:35:43,241 --> 00:35:45,209
Sure
he is not playing statue.

419
00:35:45,710 --> 00:35:47,200
Is dead.

420
00:35:50,014 --> 00:35:50,981
What about you?

421
00:35:54,685 --> 00:35:56,312
Talk to me.
What happened here?

422
00:35:56,687 --> 00:35:57,949
Him ..

423
00:35:58,456 --> 00:36:00,321
- That ...
- Where's Jack? Where'd he go?

424
00:36:00,391 --> 00:36:01,551
Him .. Him ..

425
00:36:05,363 --> 00:36:06,660
Let's get you out.
Come on.

426
00:36:08,933 --> 00:36:10,366
Let's get outta here, folks.

427
00:36:11,435 --> 00:36:12,732
What is that?

428
00:36:12,837 --> 00:36:14,304
This is not normal.

429
00:36:56,514 --> 00:36:59,278
- What is happening?
- I'll tell you one thing.

430
00:36:59,350 --> 00:37:00,578
Surely
do not fight with terrorists.

431
00:37:00,651 --> 00:37:02,585
Chief, I've seen a lot,
but that ...

432
00:37:02,753 --> 00:37:05,221
- That I do not know what it is.
- She knows something!

433
00:37:05,289 --> 00:37:08,224
OK, OK, OK.
Enough now!

434
00:37:11,195 --> 00:37:12,890
Cassandra, let me know.

435
00:37:14,298 --> 00:37:16,198
- I saw it.
- Saw what?

436
00:37:16,267 --> 00:37:17,734
I saw it.

437
00:37:17,935 --> 00:37:20,495
Does not look like anything
I have seen before.

438
00:37:21,339 --> 00:37:23,500
- We should kill her.
- She is mixed up in it.

439
00:37:23,574 --> 00:37:25,735
- She's lying. That's a lie.
- That's a lie.

440
00:37:25,810 --> 00:37:29,371
- Do not trust a woman, sir.
- Listen. Stop! Stop!

441
00:37:32,416 --> 00:37:33,940
Right. Okay.

442
00:37:34,585 --> 00:37:37,520
They told me
I had something here.

443
00:37:37,588 --> 00:37:39,852
- Nothing else ...
- My Jesus!

444
00:37:39,924 --> 00:37:41,892
- What are we doing with it?
- Nothing else ...

445
00:37:41,959 --> 00:37:44,655
No. No. No. Wait, wait.

446
00:37:45,229 --> 00:37:47,298
Go ... Right ...
Go do something.

447
00:37:47,298 --> 00:37:48,959
- Go.
- Lord ...

448
00:37:53,304 --> 00:37:55,329
- Go.
- Go to hell with it.

449
00:37:58,276 --> 00:38:00,710
- There is something here ...
- It's all I know.

450
00:38:01,479 --> 00:38:03,276
That's great.

451
00:38:03,748 --> 00:38:05,181
That's great.

452
00:38:09,887 --> 00:38:13,448
- Where are you going?
- For me it comes. She's crazy.

453
00:38:13,524 --> 00:38:16,618
Well, how about you give me a cigarette
before grabbing the cow paths.

454
00:38:30,308 --> 00:38:32,242
Man, I need
stop with these things.

455
00:38:32,443 --> 00:38:35,241
Before I could walk
two hours without stopping.

456
00:38:35,713 --> 00:38:37,305
Now I can not even twenty minutes.

457
00:38:38,849 --> 00:38:41,283
Must be why your girls
always end up in my house.

458
00:38:41,352 --> 00:38:42,341
- Your home?
- Ê.

459
00:38:42,420 --> 00:38:43,444
Let me tell you something.

460
00:38:43,587 --> 00:38:45,714
I am recognized worldwide
my ability.

461
00:38:45,923 --> 00:38:47,788
I am a machine
making babies Puerto Rican.

462
00:38:47,925 --> 00:38:49,825
I like the U. N. In this thing.

463
00:38:49,994 --> 00:38:51,518
God sent me here
for two reasons.

464
00:38:51,762 --> 00:38:55,493
- Making babies and save the day.
- You need your head examined.

465
00:38:55,566 --> 00:38:57,193
- Do I need my head examined?
- Yes.

466
00:38:57,268 --> 00:39:00,362
In the last time we've been examined,
you've had postpartum depression.

467
00:39:02,239 --> 00:39:05,470
- You have no idea what this is?
- I know what I mean.

468
00:39:05,776 --> 00:39:07,300
I went to a seminar once.

469
00:39:07,845 --> 00:39:11,212
We sat together, talked,
play "renga".

470
00:39:12,450 --> 00:39:14,782
- Did not mean Jenga?
- Yes.

471
00:39:15,953 --> 00:39:17,614
And we hugged.

472
00:39:18,656 --> 00:39:20,214
Want a hug?

473
00:39:21,792 --> 00:39:24,192
Dude, can not stay with this thing
stuck inside of you.

474
00:39:24,328 --> 00:39:27,661
Go get his head confused.
Able to hurt someone.

475
00:39:28,733 --> 00:39:30,530
First
why do you think we here?

476
00:39:51,956 --> 00:39:53,389
Do the honors, soldier.

477
00:40:01,732 --> 00:40:03,962
What you waiting for?
Shoot.

478
00:40:07,738 --> 00:40:08,670
I can not.

479
00:40:10,574 --> 00:40:13,202
That's what we get paid.
Take the damn shot.

480
00:40:24,989 --> 00:40:26,013
I can not.

481
00:40:27,324 --> 00:40:28,313
Dammit ...

482
00:40:52,316 --> 00:40:53,647
Not much money.

483
00:41:17,374 --> 00:41:18,568
Get up!

484
00:41:21,545 --> 00:41:22,569
I said get up!

485
00:41:30,387 --> 00:41:32,378
You want to tell me
you work for?

486
00:41:32,890 --> 00:41:34,687
I do not know, man.
I do not know.

487
00:41:34,959 --> 00:41:37,792
- Do not know?
- I said. I do not know.

488
00:41:37,962 --> 00:41:39,793
- What are you doing here?
- I do not know.

489
00:41:39,864 --> 00:41:44,301
- Who are you working?
- I do not know, man. No!

490
00:41:49,707 --> 00:41:51,436
- You want to tell now?
- No, man.

491
00:41:51,742 --> 00:41:53,232
- You know nothing?
- No.

492
00:41:54,311 --> 00:41:55,437
- You have the answers.
- No, I do not.

493
00:41:55,513 --> 00:41:57,310
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

494
00:41:58,849 --> 00:42:00,578
No. What are you doing?
No!

495
00:42:00,651 --> 00:42:01,845
You have five fingers.

496
00:42:02,219 --> 00:42:04,551
- Will you give me some answers.
- I know nothing. I told you everything.

497
00:42:04,622 --> 00:42:05,554
No?

498
00:42:08,792 --> 00:42:09,986
You have 4 more fingers.

499
00:42:11,362 --> 00:42:12,294
You want to tell me
you work for?

500
00:42:12,363 --> 00:42:14,729
- I said everything.
- Who are you working?

501
00:42:14,798 --> 00:42:16,265
- No?
- No. ..

502
00:42:18,636 --> 00:42:20,536
- Still missing three fingers.
- No. ..

503
00:42:20,604 --> 00:42:22,273
You want to tell me
you work for?

504
00:42:22,273 --> 00:42:23,262
I do not know.

505
00:42:35,286 --> 00:42:36,275
The hunter.

506
00:42:36,453 --> 00:42:37,579
The hunter?

507
00:42:38,055 --> 00:42:40,023
- What are you talking about?
- Hunter.

508
00:43:30,674 --> 00:43:31,868
Jackie?

509
00:43:33,577 --> 00:43:34,509
Allen?

510
00:43:35,346 --> 00:43:36,472
Where are these guys?

511
00:44:36,874 --> 00:44:37,806
Guys!

512
00:44:37,875 --> 00:44:39,001
Brent!

513
00:44:45,683 --> 00:44:47,674
- My God.
- He was right here.

514
00:44:47,751 --> 00:44:49,241
- Where?
- Right here.

515
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:50,487
Where's the body?

516
00:44:50,554 --> 00:44:52,283
Something went down and sucked it,
face, so ...

517
00:44:52,356 --> 00:44:53,380
What?

518
00:44:54,692 --> 00:44:56,284
He was right here.

519
00:44:56,427 --> 00:44:58,554
That makes no sense.
It has a lot of blood.

520
00:44:58,796 --> 00:45:00,593
Why would anyone bring a body?

521
00:45:00,864 --> 00:45:02,422
There is "one" guy.

522
00:45:02,633 --> 00:45:03,964
Ê "something."

523
00:45:05,836 --> 00:45:07,497
What do you mean by "something"?

524
00:45:08,272 --> 00:45:09,569
Something.

525
00:45:13,977 --> 00:45:15,171
Right.

526
00:45:15,479 --> 00:45:17,174
Let's get outta here.
For the helicopter now.

527
00:45:17,247 --> 00:45:18,236
- Come on now, go! Move!
- Let's go!

528
00:45:47,344 --> 00:45:48,572
Guys?

529
00:45:52,750 --> 00:45:54,411
Tyler? Trey?

530
00:46:34,258 --> 00:46:35,748
What do you see?

531
00:46:36,827 --> 00:46:39,955
I thought I saw
something moving.

532
00:46:48,338 --> 00:46:49,999
Good work, redneck.

533
00:47:09,193 --> 00:47:10,660
No!

534
00:47:22,306 --> 00:47:23,398
Give me the A-K.

535
00:47:23,674 --> 00:47:24,698
Now!

536
00:47:41,325 --> 00:47:42,257
Cease fire!

537
00:47:43,460 --> 00:47:44,552
I said, stop firing!

538
00:47:50,300 --> 00:47:53,269
- What are we shooting?
- I do not know, damn.

539
00:47:53,337 --> 00:47:54,634
Colby has been reached.

540
00:47:55,239 --> 00:47:56,467
We have to reach
until that helicopter.

541
00:47:56,540 --> 00:47:58,303
- And Colby?
- He's dead. Okay?

542
00:47:58,375 --> 00:48:00,343
He died.
Now, get moving.

543
00:48:01,311 --> 00:48:02,778
Well, look who's back.

544
00:48:04,214 --> 00:48:07,411
- Where were you?
- I was taking care of business.

545
00:48:07,551 --> 00:48:08,813
Care business? What?

546
00:48:08,886 --> 00:48:11,150
You think you can
go out alone?

547
00:48:11,221 --> 00:48:14,588
- Cres'ça appear and the son of a bitch.
- And so what do you think?

548
00:48:15,225 --> 00:48:17,819
Okay, stop,
let's stop it, OK?

549
00:48:17,961 --> 00:48:20,259
If they want to kill,
do it later.

550
00:48:20,764 --> 00:48:23,232
Jack, if you want to be alone.

551
00:48:23,700 --> 00:48:25,258
Two clicks on the radio, go!

552
00:48:25,335 --> 00:48:26,597
Understood, sir.

553
00:48:27,571 --> 00:48:28,833
Bitch!

554
00:48:30,807 --> 00:48:32,365
What crap.

555
00:49:14,551 --> 00:49:16,348
COMPONENT DAMAGE

556
00:49:54,391 --> 00:49:55,585
Continue.

557
00:50:15,278 --> 00:50:17,007
You know, gentlemen, no ...

558
00:50:17,581 --> 00:50:18,809
There's nothing ...

559
00:50:19,316 --> 00:50:22,012
honored ... absolutely nothing

560
00:50:22,786 --> 00:50:25,254
purest, most selfless ...

561
00:50:25,789 --> 00:50:27,416
who serve their country.

562
00:50:30,460 --> 00:50:34,829
This is a secret program, gentlemen,
and you know what that means.

563
00:50:39,302 --> 00:50:42,829
Things
you have to give up ...

564
00:50:44,274 --> 00:50:47,675
in joining this program
are numerous.

565
00:50:49,513 --> 00:50:52,949
Let's just say
are you going to give up ...

566
00:50:53,617 --> 00:50:55,346
every inch
the life they dreamed of.

567
00:50:58,388 --> 00:51:02,290
Every thought,
each person who loved ...

568
00:51:02,793 --> 00:51:05,660
every moment that can
remember.

569
00:51:13,703 --> 00:51:15,967
From this second onwards ...

570
00:51:17,240 --> 00:51:19,333
is all I have.

571
00:51:20,377 --> 00:51:21,469
No secret ...

572
00:51:21,645 --> 00:51:24,375
on the republic
can leave this building.

573
00:51:36,059 --> 00:51:39,517
For this reason,
I love my country ...

574
00:51:41,431 --> 00:51:43,023
even when ...

575
00:51:45,302 --> 00:51:48,271
love for the austere agenda.

576
00:51:49,506 --> 00:51:51,838
Candidate number one, stand up.

577
00:51:53,743 --> 00:51:57,702
Unfortunately his work
was not satisfactory to the committee.

578
00:51:58,014 --> 00:52:01,177
Not rated
for the E-16.

579
00:52:01,952 --> 00:52:04,682
It's also a pity
a number that is not the case.

580
00:52:10,260 --> 00:52:12,956
Six hours
primary candidates exterminated.

581
00:52:13,029 --> 00:52:14,291
Protocol 6-A.

582
00:52:21,271 --> 00:52:23,466
Candidate number two, stand.

583
00:52:24,608 --> 00:52:27,771
You do not fit the requirements
physicists that this committee recommends ...

584
00:52:27,844 --> 00:52:31,371
the ideal candidate
for the E-16.

585
00:52:31,648 --> 00:52:35,584
It seems however that the virus
herpes in one of our stops.

586
00:52:36,019 --> 00:52:39,853
No. Grandma always told me
to stay away from hoes.

587
00:52:40,290 --> 00:52:41,416
Glad to have heard my grandmother.

588
00:52:48,298 --> 00:52:49,230
Get up.

589
00:52:49,966 --> 00:52:51,456
Turn around facing the wall.

590
00:53:01,645 --> 00:53:02,839
Turn around.

591
00:53:08,618 --> 00:53:10,313
Welcome to the program.

592
00:53:14,558 --> 00:53:17,186
Candidate No. 3
you need to know ...

593
00:53:17,360 --> 00:53:19,328
sometimes ...

594
00:53:19,930 --> 00:53:21,420
kill ...

595
00:53:21,865 --> 00:53:23,890
is also to protect life.

596
00:53:28,238 --> 00:53:32,436
Even as a fierce killer,
will also be a life saver.

597
00:53:33,577 --> 00:53:36,307
You will receive a series of injections.

598
00:53:36,446 --> 00:53:39,244
The first
is a chemical ...

599
00:53:39,382 --> 00:53:42,874
that will change
their somatosensory cortex.

600
00:53:44,020 --> 00:53:46,921
What is the brain's pain center.

601
00:53:48,925 --> 00:53:52,224
It is the latest sensation of pain
you will feel.

602
00:53:52,729 --> 00:53:55,357
This will improve
every moment.

603
00:53:56,333 --> 00:53:57,357
Give him the second dose.

604
00:53:58,902 --> 00:54:03,498
This cocktail is not that
you take the haapy-hour, son.

605
00:54:04,241 --> 00:54:07,677
This causes a deficiency
norepinephrine in brain chemistry ...

606
00:54:07,744 --> 00:54:10,872
you need to periodically
to survive.

607
00:54:11,281 --> 00:54:15,650
This will allow us to control it if
there is a technical flaw in the program ...

608
00:54:15,719 --> 00:54:17,516
and you decide to fund
the joker with us.

609
00:54:18,788 --> 00:54:20,187
We ended up here.

610
00:54:20,890 --> 00:54:23,791
Take him to the 4 Wing
for surgery.

611
00:55:09,272 --> 00:55:12,503
Yes, I understand.
Execute the order-taking group.

612
00:55:12,642 --> 00:55:15,805
Allow extra funds
collateral damage because the area.

613
00:55:20,283 --> 00:55:23,684
Give the execution order
ownership for our area in the region.

614
00:55:23,753 --> 00:55:27,689
Get him out of there as soon as possible.
Send me a satellite image of the area.

615
00:55:27,957 --> 00:55:30,892
Find a way
to fix this mess.

616
00:55:36,766 --> 00:55:38,324
Damn!

617
00:55:41,971 --> 00:55:43,268
Alpha, Bravo ...

618
00:55:43,506 --> 00:55:45,371
Six. In listening to?

619
00:55:50,246 --> 00:55:52,339
Alpha, Bravo, six!

620
00:55:55,051 --> 00:55:56,211
Damn!

621
00:55:56,686 --> 00:55:58,881
This helicopter is good to be there.

622
00:55:59,556 --> 00:56:00,955
The more you know, "chica"?

623
00:56:01,391 --> 00:56:04,155
Know that the guilt of all these
and his men killed?

624
00:56:04,227 --> 00:56:06,286
You're the reason we are all
this godforsaken jungle.

625
00:56:06,429 --> 00:56:07,521
Jesse!

626
00:56:08,565 --> 00:56:10,260
They joked with us
for their own profit.

627
00:56:10,333 --> 00:56:11,698
Now comes, Jesse!

628
00:56:13,203 --> 00:56:14,192
Enough!

629
00:56:14,904 --> 00:56:18,305
Whatever is out there
we all will need to kill her.

630
00:56:18,408 --> 00:56:21,468
If the command does not respond or,
no problem.

631
00:56:21,644 --> 00:56:24,340
We need to kill this thing
or she will kill us.

632
00:56:24,481 --> 00:56:25,641
Against what are we fighting for, boss?

633
00:56:26,750 --> 00:56:28,650
When he was trained for this?

634
00:56:28,718 --> 00:56:30,982
When required to do so?
Because I was not.

635
00:56:31,221 --> 00:56:32,245
Because he knows that, sir.

636
00:56:32,322 --> 00:56:33,721
We do not have much choice now,
have?

637
00:56:34,357 --> 00:56:36,450
- I did not get enough.
- Enough! Chill out, soldier.

638
00:56:36,526 --> 00:56:37,823
Ê an order.

639
00:56:43,767 --> 00:56:45,359
You do not know anything else?

640
00:56:47,003 --> 00:56:49,938
Lord, have to attack
as much to defend here.

641
00:56:50,540 --> 00:56:52,269
Is the only way
we can get out of here.

642
00:56:52,342 --> 00:56:55,834
No. The only way out of here
ê get to the point of withdrawal.

643
00:56:55,912 --> 00:56:57,470
That if a recession.

644
00:56:58,248 --> 00:56:59,340
They'll be here.

645
00:56:59,416 --> 00:57:00,906
How can we believe in it,
Sir?

646
00:57:00,984 --> 00:57:03,179
- We can not.
- Brent is right.

647
00:57:03,386 --> 00:57:05,286
We need to attack
this son of a bitch.

648
00:57:08,591 --> 00:57:09,956
It's getting late.

649
00:57:10,193 --> 00:57:11,626
Let's camp here.

650
00:57:12,395 --> 00:57:14,488
We need to attack this son of a bitch.

651
00:57:58,641 --> 00:57:59,903
And now?

652
00:57:59,976 --> 00:58:02,274
We will do what we do best.
We'll wait.

653
00:58:16,426 --> 00:58:18,394
Come on, son of a bitch.

654
00:58:19,496 --> 00:58:21,361
C'mon, bastard.

655
00:58:27,403 --> 00:58:28,335
Come on.

656
00:58:46,723 --> 00:58:48,816
Lord, it's just a terrorist.

657
00:58:55,798 --> 00:58:59,199
- His legs came here.
- Yes, and head there.

658
00:58:59,769 --> 00:59:01,134
He did not know the direction he went.

659
00:59:01,204 --> 00:59:03,672
This guy was dead
before the explosion.

660
00:59:03,840 --> 00:59:05,432
He used this body
to explode the mine.

661
00:59:05,508 --> 00:59:07,203
He is fooling us.

662
00:59:08,211 --> 00:59:10,179
I'm officially angry!

663
00:59:11,915 --> 00:59:15,407
- Okay, reset the trap.
- Really? Please, let's get outta here.

664
00:59:15,485 --> 00:59:17,180
Looks like I'm kidding?

665
00:59:17,420 --> 00:59:20,184
This thing is hunting us.

666
00:59:29,632 --> 00:59:31,190
Let me guess.

667
00:59:31,334 --> 00:59:32,767
This is bullshit?

668
00:59:32,902 --> 00:59:33,960
Bingo.

669
00:59:57,760 --> 01:00:00,490
If you think
that will bring me out so easy ...

670
01:00:00,797 --> 01:00:02,924
will see only you jerk.

671
01:00:04,467 --> 01:00:08,301
Guide me through the valley
the shadow of death.

672
01:00:36,399 --> 01:00:38,867
Not bad this gadget
have made here.

673
01:00:40,436 --> 01:00:41,733
To a woman.

674
01:00:42,271 --> 01:00:44,501
Not bad this gadget
have made here.

675
01:00:44,807 --> 01:00:46,274
For a boy.

676
01:00:48,277 --> 01:00:49,608
Right. Well .. whatever ...

677
01:00:57,987 --> 01:00:59,386
Yes?

678
01:00:59,722 --> 01:01:01,485
Want to see the contraption?

679
01:01:01,691 --> 01:01:03,318
And God made Adam.

680
01:01:04,927 --> 01:01:06,588
You are omitting ...

681
01:01:30,319 --> 01:01:33,846
Listen, I'm sorry for what I said
on his staff before.

682
01:01:34,390 --> 01:01:35,982
OK, they're nice guys.

683
01:01:38,695 --> 01:01:40,219
They are the best.

684
01:01:41,898 --> 01:01:43,866
The day started out beautiful, is not it?

685
01:01:48,571 --> 01:01:50,698
When I was serving in Iraq ...

686
01:01:51,307 --> 01:01:54,276
The Colonel used to say
all the time ...

687
01:01:54,911 --> 01:01:57,345
it was a beautiful day to die.

688
01:01:57,714 --> 01:02:00,945
Strange how some way
it sounds romantic.

689
01:02:06,022 --> 01:02:08,388
So what's the worst situation
he faced?

690
01:02:11,661 --> 01:02:13,492
I was in a helicopter ...

691
01:02:14,263 --> 01:02:15,924
on Somalia.

692
01:02:16,332 --> 01:02:18,892
We were attacked, abducted ...

693
01:02:21,537 --> 01:02:23,903
and I was the only one who survived.

694
01:02:26,576 --> 01:02:28,203
Shall be blessed.

695
01:02:28,611 --> 01:02:29,669
Ê ...

696
01:02:30,379 --> 01:02:31,403
Ê ...

697
01:02:32,415 --> 01:02:34,349
Maybe it's cursed.

698
01:02:36,719 --> 01:02:39,950
Listen, I did not
scare the group before.

699
01:02:41,524 --> 01:02:44,857
This region was the area
Test E-16.

700
01:02:51,434 --> 01:02:52,924
OK. I'm listening.

701
01:02:53,469 --> 01:02:55,266
What is E-16?

702
01:02:56,405 --> 01:03:00,842
It was a secret project to create
the perfect cyborg soldier.

703
01:03:01,244 --> 01:03:03,371
We're talking half-man,
half computer.

704
01:03:03,679 --> 01:03:06,204
This thing can survive
temperatures and land ...

705
01:03:06,282 --> 01:03:07,681
that no human could.

706
01:03:07,917 --> 01:03:10,886
Equipped with weapons outputs
comic book.

707
01:03:11,220 --> 01:03:13,848
They were injecting into this thing
human brain cells ...

708
01:03:13,923 --> 01:03:16,221
who had just turned
and multiplied ...

709
01:03:16,292 --> 01:03:17,850
at a level of intelligence that we ...

710
01:03:17,927 --> 01:03:19,485
we will never comprehend.

711
01:03:19,796 --> 01:03:21,423
And they lost loves
control over it.

712
01:03:21,497 --> 01:03:22,725
Completely.

713
01:03:24,367 --> 01:03:25,925
That's right.
So tell me one thing ...

714
01:03:27,770 --> 01:03:29,635
why this thing is catching
the human brain?

715
01:03:29,872 --> 01:03:31,669
I have no idea.

716
01:03:33,943 --> 01:03:35,877
Half man, half machine,
is not it?

717
01:03:39,348 --> 01:03:40,246
Well ..

718
01:03:41,250 --> 01:03:43,445
so I think today
're a beautiful day to die.

719
01:04:02,004 --> 01:04:03,266
Come on! Come on!

720
01:04:04,574 --> 01:04:05,563
Damn!

721
01:04:07,376 --> 01:04:08,502
Jesse!

722
01:04:26,863 --> 01:04:29,923
COMPONENT DAMAGE

723
01:04:32,802 --> 01:04:34,201
Jesse! Okay.

724
01:04:34,270 --> 01:04:35,202
Where'd he go?
Where'd he go?

725
01:04:35,271 --> 01:04:36,568
I think the hit.

726
01:04:41,944 --> 01:04:43,775
Let's go to that helicopter.
Come on.

727
01:04:45,281 --> 01:04:46,646
Where are the others?

728
01:04:46,849 --> 01:04:48,339
They're dead.

729
01:04:49,018 --> 01:04:49,985
This is ...

730
01:04:54,924 --> 01:04:56,357
Go! Go!

731
01:04:56,592 --> 01:04:57,820
Get out!

732
01:05:03,466 --> 01:05:04,933
Son of a bitch!

733
01:05:38,601 --> 01:05:40,262
I'm not impressed.

734
01:05:41,370 --> 01:05:43,395
You can not miss me
bastard!

735
01:05:43,773 --> 01:05:45,240
Do not understand yet?

736
01:05:53,582 --> 01:05:54,776
Naughty!

737
01:07:57,373 --> 01:07:58,567
Showtime.

738
01:08:14,824 --> 01:08:16,189
Well ...

739
01:08:16,792 --> 01:08:18,589
Come, you son of a bitch.

740
01:08:21,564 --> 01:08:23,862
Come get me.
Come get me.

741
01:08:31,941 --> 01:08:33,306
Come on.

742
01:08:49,291 --> 01:08:50,758
I got it.

743
01:08:50,993 --> 01:08:52,756
How is it, man?

744
01:09:22,324 --> 01:09:23,416
Ê ...

745
01:09:23,659 --> 01:09:26,219
Are you scared now
is not, pal?

746
01:09:26,295 --> 01:09:27,762
Where are you?

747
01:09:44,513 --> 01:09:46,208
But what ...

748
01:11:45,501 --> 01:11:47,025
It is never easy.

749
01:11:59,281 --> 01:12:00,407
Dude ...

750
01:12:50,366 --> 01:12:51,628
Tyler?

751
01:12:51,867 --> 01:12:53,300
Tyler?

752
01:12:55,871 --> 01:12:57,338
Hold on, soldier.

753
01:13:26,435 --> 01:13:28,198
Destroyed? Right.

754
01:13:28,804 --> 01:13:31,500
Send a search party
and search for survivors.

755
01:13:31,573 --> 01:13:33,200
Destroy all the information ...

756
01:13:33,342 --> 01:13:35,902
and develop a narrative of denial.

757
01:13:37,246 --> 01:13:39,237
You know when I was young ...

758
01:13:40,015 --> 01:13:42,384
I had dreams and fantasies ...

759
01:13:42,384 --> 01:13:46,343
to be there on the day
in which Thomas Jefferson ...

760
01:13:46,555 --> 01:13:50,548
signed the declaration of independence
or when Francis Scott Key ..

761
01:13:50,759 --> 01:13:53,751
wrote the national anthem.

762
01:13:54,763 --> 01:13:57,596
This is the greatest nation ...

763
01:13:59,301 --> 01:14:01,496
in the history of civilization.

764
01:14:01,904 --> 01:14:06,238
No secret this republic
should leave this building.

765
01:14:09,678 --> 01:14:10,770
So ...

766
01:14:11,480 --> 01:14:13,345
I love my country ...

767
01:14:15,250 --> 01:14:16,376
even when ...

768
01:14:19,021 --> 01:14:21,649
love for the austere agenda.

769
01:14:23,325 --> 01:14:26,886
My only comfort is knowing now
this second ...

770
01:14:27,229 --> 01:14:30,926
I did the best for the country
I call mine.

771
01:14:32,034 --> 01:14:36,596
Gentlemen, this second on,
that's all I have.

772
01:15:04,299 --> 01:15:05,732
Great job, soldier.

773
01:15:06,735 --> 01:15:09,203
I will indicate Io
for a medal for that.

774
01:15:12,307 --> 01:15:13,296
Ê ...

775
01:15:19,681 --> 01:15:21,171
Sorry, son.

776
01:15:21,583 --> 01:15:23,210
And so it is.

777
01:15:23,785 --> 01:15:26,515
I mean, this is protocol
this type of operation.

778
01:15:27,256 --> 01:15:28,553
Now ...

779
01:15:29,258 --> 01:15:30,987
you understand that, do not?

780
01:15:31,460 --> 01:15:32,859
And again ...

781
01:15:34,496 --> 01:15:37,260
You did a great job.

782
01:15:45,040 --> 01:15:46,769
You know something, sir?

783
01:15:49,578 --> 01:15:51,443
I never liked cigars.

784
01:15:58,287 --> 01:15:59,777
Jesse was right.

785
01:16:00,355 --> 01:16:01,822
This is stupid.

786
01:16:08,297 --> 01:16:10,231
So what now, lieutenant?

787
01:16:13,302 --> 01:16:14,291
I'll ...

788
01:16:16,572 --> 01:16:19,166
find families
of my men ...

789
01:16:20,842 --> 01:16:22,241
and tell them the truth.

790
01:16:23,879 --> 01:16:26,177
You know, I was wrong about you.

791
01:16:27,583 --> 01:16:30,177
Thank you for going after me.

792
01:16:30,686 --> 01:16:33,177
- You saved my life.
- Anytime.

793
01:16:34,890 --> 01:16:36,221
Take care.

794
01:16:37,693 --> 01:16:38,990
Tyler.

795
01:16:54,943 --> 01:16:56,342
I see there.
