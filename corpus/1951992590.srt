1
00:00:37,951 --> 00:00:41,648
<i>Imagine an end to crime...</i>

2
00:00:42,389 --> 00:00:44,550
<i>...an end to poverty.</i>

3
00:00:44,958 --> 00:00:50,294
<i>Imagine 2 million good jobs
waiting to be filled.</i>

4
00:00:50,697 --> 00:00:53,530
<i>Sounds like a dream, doesn't it?</i>

5
00:00:54,334 --> 00:00:58,737
<i>Well, sometimes dreams come true.</i>

6
00:00:58,972 --> 00:01:00,667
<i>Delta City.</i>

7
00:01:01,041 --> 00:01:02,975
<i>For our children.</i>

8
00:01:09,916 --> 00:01:13,818
<i>This is Media Break. You give us
three minutes, we'll give you the world.</i>

9
00:01:14,421 --> 00:01:17,413
<i>Good evening, I'm Casey Wong.
Our top story tonight:</i>

10
00:01:17,591 --> 00:01:21,584
<i>Motor City goes Japanese as the
Omni Consumer Products Corporation...</i>

11
00:01:21,762 --> 00:01:25,357
<i>...ended months of speculation today
by announcing its takeover...</i>

12
00:01:25,565 --> 00:01:28,830
<i>...by the multinational
Kanemitsu Corporation.</i>

13
00:01:29,002 --> 00:01:33,063
Come on, honey, hurry up with your
calculus. It's almost time for bed.

14
00:01:34,007 --> 00:01:36,066
I'm watching Media Break.

15
00:01:36,376 --> 00:01:39,868
<i>- the first private corporation
to completely own and operate a major city.</i>

16
00:01:40,046 --> 00:01:42,446
<i>Company spokesmen
express special interest...</i>

17
00:01:42,582 --> 00:01:44,675
<i>...in the issues of urban resettlement...</i>

18
00:01:44,851 --> 00:01:49,948
<i>...and a crime wave in Detroit that
many citizens are calling a war zone.</i>

19
00:01:53,527 --> 00:01:55,722
<i>But as usual, OCP has an answer.</i>

20
00:01:56,463 --> 00:02:00,024
<i>Meet the Rehabs, Urban
rehabilitation officers.</i>

21
00:02:00,367 --> 00:02:02,528
<i>From the blazing fields
of the Amazon War...</i>

22
00:02:02,702 --> 00:02:05,933
<i>...comes state-of-the-art
urban pacification.</i>

23
00:02:06,273 --> 00:02:10,972
<i>We're here to help the people, augment the
police force and deal with the gang problem.</i>

24
00:02:11,311 --> 00:02:13,802
<i>What about reports you're
actually evicting people...</i>

25
00:02:14,014 --> 00:02:16,642
<i>...to make way for
construction of Delta City?</i>

26
00:02:17,017 --> 00:02:19,508
Nikko, you heard your mom.
Go on.

27
00:02:20,487 --> 00:02:22,045
Oh, man.

28
00:02:24,825 --> 00:02:26,520
<i>- And the homeless?
- What a gyp.</i>

29
00:02:26,726 --> 00:02:30,355
<i>Some buildings have to come down
before Delta can go up.</i>

30
00:02:30,764 --> 00:02:33,665
<i>I won't deny we're serving
an eviction notice or two...</i>

31
00:02:33,834 --> 00:02:38,669
<i>...but most of these people have already
taken their urine tests and placement exams.</i>

32
00:02:38,839 --> 00:02:41,535
<i>They've got new jobs waiting for them.</i>

33
00:02:41,741 --> 00:02:44,642
<i>We're just helping them
make the transition, that's all.</i>

34
00:02:45,078 --> 00:02:48,946
<i>- We're cops, nothing more.
- Nothing more?</i>

35
00:02:49,349 --> 00:02:51,840
<i>Well, we're not robots,
if that's what you mean.</i>

36
00:03:18,612 --> 00:03:19,909
Hey, Dad?

37
00:03:25,385 --> 00:03:27,080
You're supposed to be asleep.

38
00:03:27,521 --> 00:03:31,457
Is it true what the TV said?

39
00:03:31,992 --> 00:03:33,857
That it's a war zone outside?

40
00:03:34,094 --> 00:03:38,326
Don't listen to what the TV says.
This is your home, you hear me?

41
00:03:38,498 --> 00:03:40,329
And you're safe here.

42
00:03:47,541 --> 00:03:50,635
<i>I'll buy that for a dollar!</i>

43
00:03:51,478 --> 00:03:54,072
Get out, get out, get out!

44
00:04:01,655 --> 00:04:04,954
This neighborhood is the
property of Omni Consumer Products.

45
00:04:31,952 --> 00:04:35,888
- For God's sake, help us!
- That's what we're here for, ma'am.

46
00:04:39,693 --> 00:04:41,752
Just get on the bus.

47
00:04:42,362 --> 00:04:45,559
Where are they taking us, Dad?
What's happening?

48
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:51,801
Don't believe them! They'll throw us
into the streets to die like rats!

49
00:04:51,972 --> 00:04:54,702
Nazi sons of bitches!

50
00:04:59,613 --> 00:05:01,843
Shoot her if you must,
but get her out of here.

51
00:05:02,015 --> 00:05:03,482
Yes, sir.

52
00:05:04,284 --> 00:05:06,684
Let's go. Come on.

53
00:05:06,886 --> 00:05:09,616
I think it's going rather well,
don't you?

54
00:05:09,823 --> 00:05:10,983
Yes, sir.

55
00:05:11,424 --> 00:05:14,052
Come on, I said, move! Move!

56
00:05:14,394 --> 00:05:17,852
- Manandle an old lady, would you?
- Shut up!

57
00:05:20,367 --> 00:05:22,062
- Move, move!
- Get up there!

58
00:05:22,469 --> 00:05:24,369
I said, get up!

59
00:05:25,438 --> 00:05:29,272
What are you doing down there?
Piece of slime!

60
00:05:29,876 --> 00:05:31,468
Can you hear me?

61
00:05:32,746 --> 00:05:35,306
I said, get up, you drunken cow!

62
00:05:38,518 --> 00:05:41,453
Get back! The crane's gonna blow!

63
00:05:52,966 --> 00:05:56,265
Listen to me, people!
These buses are going nowhere!

64
00:05:56,770 --> 00:06:01,469
Stay here! Fight for your homes!
There is no silver lining!

65
00:06:01,641 --> 00:06:06,408
Only corporate scumbags
who want to line their pockets!

66
00:06:13,453 --> 00:06:15,614
Nikko! Nikko!

67
00:06:15,789 --> 00:06:19,691
Mom! Mom! Dad!

68
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:25,498
Nikko! No! That's my baby!
Nikko, Nikko!

69
00:06:27,534 --> 00:06:31,300
Mom! Dad! Dad!

70
00:06:31,538 --> 00:06:33,301
Mom, Dad!

71
00:06:37,811 --> 00:06:39,676
Mom!

72
00:06:51,624 --> 00:06:53,558
Mom!

73
00:06:54,494 --> 00:06:55,893
Dad?!

74
00:06:58,398 --> 00:07:00,298
Mom!

75
00:07:11,945 --> 00:07:14,505
You! Stay where you are!

76
00:07:36,736 --> 00:07:41,366
<i>Repeat: The rehabilitation
officers are here to assist you.</i>

77
00:07:49,315 --> 00:07:52,978
It's okay, it's okay.
You're with us now.

78
00:07:53,887 --> 00:07:54,876
Is he gone?

79
00:07:55,889 --> 00:07:57,618
Are we clear?

80
00:07:57,791 --> 00:07:58,849
Clear!

81
00:07:59,926 --> 00:08:01,917
Okay, let's do it.

82
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:14,729
Okay, Moreno.

83
00:08:14,908 --> 00:08:15,897
<i>Cover your ears.</i>

84
00:08:19,579 --> 00:08:20,978
Rock 'n roll.

85
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:34,527
<i>All clear. Let's go.</i>

86
00:08:48,942 --> 00:08:50,500
Jesus!

87
00:08:52,612 --> 00:08:55,080
- ED 209!
- He wasn't in the recon photo!

88
00:08:58,084 --> 00:09:01,747
Freeze! You are trespassing
on police property.

89
00:09:01,921 --> 00:09:03,513
Please surrender your weapons.

90
00:09:03,723 --> 00:09:05,554
- What the hell?
- Is she crazy?

91
00:09:05,725 --> 00:09:07,590
You have 20 seconds to comply.

92
00:09:07,794 --> 00:09:11,457
- Hey, kid, come back here!
- You're gonna get us all killed!

93
00:09:12,599 --> 00:09:14,590
What the hell is she doing?

94
00:09:14,767 --> 00:09:18,863
You are in direct violation
of penal code 114, section 3.

95
00:09:19,038 --> 00:09:22,337
I am authorized to use physical force.

96
00:09:22,542 --> 00:09:25,511
You now have 10 seconds to comply.

97
00:09:26,579 --> 00:09:29,946
You won't believe this.
He'll be loyal as a puppy.

98
00:09:30,350 --> 00:09:33,444
You have five seconds.
Four seconds.

99
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:38,286
Three seconds.
You have one second to comply.

100
00:09:38,458 --> 00:09:40,858
I am now authorized to...

101
00:09:41,861 --> 00:09:44,386
...be loyal as a puppy.

102
00:09:44,831 --> 00:09:45,957
Damn!

103
00:09:54,641 --> 00:09:55,630
Will it work?

104
00:09:56,910 --> 00:09:58,810
Stole it off a dead cop.

105
00:10:06,319 --> 00:10:08,446
Holy shit! That's the police armory!

106
00:10:11,658 --> 00:10:14,923
- They deleted the access signature.
- Let's get out of here!

107
00:10:15,428 --> 00:10:18,727
They'll be a few minutes. Let's
figure out how to open that door!

108
00:10:18,898 --> 00:10:20,058
Are you kidding me?

109
00:11:02,442 --> 00:11:04,273
One-stop shopping.

110
00:11:10,783 --> 00:11:13,581
- Let's go! Gotta get out of here!
- He's right. Let's ride.

111
00:11:17,390 --> 00:11:20,416
- What are you, picking out drapes?
- Coming!

112
00:11:25,798 --> 00:11:27,390
- Get that.
- Why?

113
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,659
It looks expensive.

114
00:11:36,042 --> 00:11:37,976
Come on! Come on, let's go!

115
00:11:44,017 --> 00:11:45,382
Drop your weapons now!

116
00:11:45,785 --> 00:11:47,480
Do it! Drop them!

117
00:11:53,926 --> 00:11:57,054
Freeze! You're trespassing
on police property.

118
00:11:58,564 --> 00:12:00,327
Eat lead, suckers!

119
00:12:10,810 --> 00:12:12,641
Nikko, get in! Come on!

120
00:12:51,050 --> 00:12:52,347
What can I do for you?

121
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:56,351
Nobody move!

122
00:12:56,522 --> 00:12:58,786
Everything in the register!
Now! Do it!

123
00:13:07,667 --> 00:13:10,500
What's it like
being a rocket scientist?

124
00:13:10,670 --> 00:13:15,300
<i>All units, we have a B and E involving
police property, please respond.</i>

125
00:13:15,475 --> 00:13:17,807
<i>Repeat, all units, we have a...</i>

126
00:13:18,010 --> 00:13:20,877
Hey, Donnelly, it's your turn.

127
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:24,914
- No way. We went last time.
- No, it's Lewis' turn.

128
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:28,844
Lewis, you're up.

129
00:13:30,590 --> 00:13:33,650
Lewis! Lewis! Lewis!

130
00:13:35,361 --> 00:13:38,353
Isn't anybody gonna arrest me,
or what?!

131
00:13:38,731 --> 00:13:41,791
- Where's your friend Murphy?
- He's not big on doughnuts.

132
00:13:41,968 --> 00:13:44,027
- He's not big on doughnuts.
- I knew that.

133
00:13:44,437 --> 00:13:47,929
<i>All units, repeat,
that is a battered yellow van.</i>

134
00:13:48,307 --> 00:13:50,707
<i>No plates.
Tracking shows southbound...</i>

135
00:13:51,577 --> 00:13:54,774
- That's a battered yellow van.
- No shit, Sherlock.

136
00:14:05,892 --> 00:14:07,826
Moreno, company's coming!

137
00:14:11,764 --> 00:14:13,288
Hold on. Here we go.

138
00:14:19,872 --> 00:14:23,672
Unit 477 in pursuit,
eastbound, Esposito.

139
00:14:32,952 --> 00:14:33,976
Watch it!

140
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:35,685
I'm watching it!

141
00:14:58,611 --> 00:14:59,600
Jesus!

142
00:15:14,460 --> 00:15:15,927
They're still on our tail.

143
00:15:16,429 --> 00:15:17,953
Don't sweat it.

144
00:15:18,297 --> 00:15:20,265
Hey, kid. Watch this.

145
00:16:01,607 --> 00:16:03,472
Hold the champagne.

146
00:16:13,886 --> 00:16:15,877
You stopped in the middle
of the street!

147
00:16:16,055 --> 00:16:18,683
- That was my light!
- You idiot!

148
00:16:18,858 --> 00:16:21,884
- Is everybody okay?
- Okay? What are you, a comedian?

149
00:16:22,094 --> 00:16:25,461
I traded in a brand new SUX
for this classic. Now look at it!

150
00:16:25,631 --> 00:16:28,065
It's garbage. It's going to the junkyard.

151
00:16:28,434 --> 00:16:33,462
What is this, fellas? You give a broad
a badge and she gets delusions of gander.

152
00:16:33,639 --> 00:16:36,369
It's "grandeur," dumbshit.

153
00:16:39,945 --> 00:16:42,641
This new guy is making me nervous.

154
00:16:43,549 --> 00:16:45,813
I don't think this is exactly a guy.

155
00:16:45,985 --> 00:16:47,646
You think it's him?

156
00:16:53,559 --> 00:16:55,322
Unit 477 to dispatch.

157
00:16:55,494 --> 00:16:58,725
This is 477 to dispatch.
Come in, dispatch.

158
00:16:58,898 --> 00:17:00,798
We could use some backup out here.

159
00:17:00,966 --> 00:17:04,834
Hello, dispatch. Come in.
This is 477 to dispatch.

160
00:17:05,705 --> 00:17:06,797
Lewis.

161
00:17:12,645 --> 00:17:14,044
Splatterpunks.

162
00:17:16,515 --> 00:17:19,746
Wait a second, what do you need
the shotgun for?

163
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:21,853
Shit, we're all gonna die.

164
00:17:22,054 --> 00:17:24,750
- Sit tight, people. Backup's coming.
- Sit tight?

165
00:17:24,924 --> 00:17:29,452
If it wasn't for you, I wouldn't
even be here, you dumb broad.

166
00:17:29,628 --> 00:17:33,792
I'll make you a deal, tough guy.
You want to eat the tie, keep it up.

167
00:17:33,999 --> 00:17:36,559
Take it easy. My brother's a cop.

168
00:18:19,311 --> 00:18:24,044
<i>477 to dispatch, code 3! We're low
on ammo and need immediate backup!</i>

169
00:18:24,350 --> 00:18:25,339
<i>Right now!</i>

170
00:18:35,094 --> 00:18:36,425
Sergeant Reed.

171
00:18:36,929 --> 00:18:38,863
I got Murphy's cruiser on the grid.

172
00:18:39,064 --> 00:18:41,464
- He just turned around.
- He what?!

173
00:19:04,957 --> 00:19:06,925
Murphy, this is Reed.

174
00:19:07,092 --> 00:19:09,993
I have three other vehicles
en route to Lewis.

175
00:19:10,629 --> 00:19:15,692
Murphy, continue pursuit! That is a
direct order! Do I make myself clear?

176
00:19:15,868 --> 00:19:17,460
<i>Murphy, are you listen...?</i>

177
00:20:26,772 --> 00:20:29,536
Police officer. No loitering.

178
00:20:45,925 --> 00:20:47,324
You called for backup?

179
00:20:52,665 --> 00:20:54,997
Thanks for dropping by, Murphy.

180
00:20:55,834 --> 00:20:57,563
Are they gone?

181
00:20:58,337 --> 00:21:00,396
I'm still scanning three.

182
00:21:08,614 --> 00:21:10,673
Make that two.

183
00:21:16,956 --> 00:21:19,356
Block it! Megazone invasion!

184
00:21:19,525 --> 00:21:22,824
Pop a tranq, hypo-head.
Splatterville's ours.

185
00:21:23,562 --> 00:21:25,427
Shoot him in the mouth.

186
00:21:25,664 --> 00:21:27,495
Cyborg eats bullets, Jock.

187
00:21:28,267 --> 00:21:29,564
Not tonight he don't.

188
00:22:20,986 --> 00:22:22,351
Hit him in the mouth!

189
00:22:22,554 --> 00:22:24,454
- Shut up!
- Do it! Do it!

190
00:22:24,590 --> 00:22:26,581
- Do it! Do it!
- Shut up!

191
00:22:31,497 --> 00:22:33,260
Nice try, creeps.

192
00:22:33,432 --> 00:22:34,421
Give me it!

193
00:22:35,868 --> 00:22:38,302
You have the right to remain silent.

194
00:22:47,646 --> 00:22:49,079
Down there.

195
00:22:55,287 --> 00:22:57,016
Jesus, Murphy, are you okay?

196
00:22:57,356 --> 00:22:59,051
I'm fine, Anne.

197
00:22:59,391 --> 00:23:00,824
Thank you for asking.

198
00:23:02,861 --> 00:23:04,453
Come on, come on!

199
00:23:19,978 --> 00:23:22,947
Let's go! Everything
will be all right.

200
00:23:26,285 --> 00:23:27,775
Get your damn hands off me!

201
00:23:32,991 --> 00:23:34,390
Stupid kid.

202
00:23:44,603 --> 00:23:47,834
- Come here. Come on.
- Would you forget the stupid kid already?!

203
00:24:28,847 --> 00:24:30,747
Kanemitsu-san...

204
00:24:30,916 --> 00:24:33,544
...I realize we've had setbacks...

205
00:24:33,719 --> 00:24:38,679
...but we've done everything possible
to get Delta City back on schedule.

206
00:24:52,437 --> 00:24:53,563
Gentlemen...

207
00:24:55,874 --> 00:24:58,809
...you are now looking at a company...

208
00:24:58,977 --> 00:25:00,467
...in transition.

209
00:25:01,346 --> 00:25:05,749
Needless to say, this has resulted in
the implementation of certain...

210
00:25:05,918 --> 00:25:07,351
...well...

211
00:25:07,519 --> 00:25:08,986
...let's call them...

212
00:25:09,721 --> 00:25:11,450
..."cutbacks."

213
00:25:11,623 --> 00:25:14,683
But who can put a price tag
on a dream?

214
00:25:16,461 --> 00:25:19,589
Our esteemed former chairman
had a dream.

215
00:25:19,765 --> 00:25:21,528
He called it Delta City.

216
00:25:22,601 --> 00:25:24,068
Knock it off, Johnson.

217
00:25:27,706 --> 00:25:32,075
The great city of Detroit represents
an important precedent, gentlemen.

218
00:25:32,644 --> 00:25:35,272
There's only one small problem.

219
00:25:35,714 --> 00:25:37,978
It's turning into a war zone!

220
00:25:38,350 --> 00:25:39,977
It's just a small resistance group.

221
00:25:40,319 --> 00:25:43,311
There's no reason to believe they
pose a significant threat.

222
00:25:43,555 --> 00:25:45,022
I'd consider...

223
00:25:45,357 --> 00:25:49,555
...a deficit of 350 million dollars
a significant threat.

224
00:25:49,761 --> 00:25:51,285
Wouldn't you?

225
00:25:52,965 --> 00:25:54,728
- Fleck!
- Sir.

226
00:25:54,867 --> 00:25:56,994
You're in charge of Security Concepts.

227
00:25:57,302 --> 00:26:00,328
Where's that Robocop
we spent so much money on?

228
00:26:00,505 --> 00:26:04,441
The police had a problem
with the unit. I'm dealing with it personally.

229
00:26:04,610 --> 00:26:06,009
You do that.

230
00:26:06,612 --> 00:26:08,273
Get him to the Rehab Team...

231
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:12,940
...and maybe we won't have to worry
about a "small resistance group."

232
00:26:13,285 --> 00:26:15,515
Get the hell out of here, all of you!

233
00:26:15,687 --> 00:26:16,949
You take your time.

234
00:26:17,289 --> 00:26:19,450
And for God's sake, Fleck...

235
00:26:19,625 --> 00:26:22,526
...try to get the police on our side.

236
00:26:27,633 --> 00:26:30,625
What if I don't want
a robot on my team?

237
00:26:32,070 --> 00:26:34,698
You've got 4 days, McDaggett.

238
00:26:35,274 --> 00:26:38,766
If Cadillac Heights isn't cleared
for demolition Friday midnight...

239
00:26:38,977 --> 00:26:42,970
...our loans will be called in.
OCP will be ruined.

240
00:26:43,348 --> 00:26:45,077
We made a deal, didn't we, chum?

241
00:26:46,084 --> 00:26:48,382
Oh, by the way...

242
00:26:49,388 --> 00:26:54,052
...if you're just figuring out the
line between big business and war...

243
00:26:54,393 --> 00:26:56,554
...is a little blurry...

244
00:26:56,762 --> 00:26:59,526
...then you're further over the hill
than they say.

245
00:27:52,551 --> 00:27:56,351
This is entrapment! My client was
visiting close friends in that motel.

246
00:27:56,521 --> 00:27:59,615
Hey, buddy. Your client's friends...

247
00:27:59,791 --> 00:28:02,851
...were a non-union video crew
and a German shepherd.

248
00:28:03,061 --> 00:28:04,460
That's prejudicial.

249
00:28:04,629 --> 00:28:08,395
Did the arresting officer
ask to see their union cards?

250
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:11,967
Come get this crap.
Will someone answer the damn phone?!

251
00:28:12,337 --> 00:28:16,296
Metro West. No, ma'am,
we're not on strike.

252
00:28:16,475 --> 00:28:19,933
You could have fooled me.
I'll deal with those looters myself.

253
00:28:20,278 --> 00:28:22,974
Get me a baseball bat
with some nails in it.

254
00:28:31,723 --> 00:28:33,350
How are you feeling?

255
00:28:34,893 --> 00:28:36,520
I've been better.

256
00:28:37,496 --> 00:28:41,626
To be honest, it looks like you just
made friends with a Mack truck.

257
00:28:43,602 --> 00:28:45,331
I don't have many...

258
00:28:45,470 --> 00:28:46,528
...friends.

259
00:28:57,716 --> 00:28:58,705
Dr. Lazarus?

260
00:29:00,685 --> 00:29:05,645
- You want to tell me what happened?
- Atlanta beat the Pistons last night.

261
00:29:05,824 --> 00:29:09,817
- That's cute. I meant with glory boy.
- Oh, him.

262
00:29:10,562 --> 00:29:13,463
He got shot to hell and set on fire.

263
00:29:13,632 --> 00:29:17,261
You know what I'm talking about.
He disobeyed a direct order. Why?

264
00:29:17,436 --> 00:29:20,997
- My real opinion?
- No, lie. Make up a story.

265
00:29:22,274 --> 00:29:23,901
Well, Mr. Fleck...

266
00:29:25,510 --> 00:29:26,807
...offhand...

267
00:29:26,978 --> 00:29:30,914
...l'd say the only reason
he'd disobey an order is if...

268
00:29:31,083 --> 00:29:32,914
...he didn't agree with it.

269
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:36,309
Excuse me?

270
00:29:37,622 --> 00:29:39,522
He made a decision.

271
00:29:39,825 --> 00:29:43,761
His friend was in trouble, he made
a judgment call. Cops do that.

272
00:29:43,929 --> 00:29:46,989
Human cops. What do you mean,
"his friend"? It's a machine.

273
00:29:47,299 --> 00:29:51,565
Look, if OCP just wanted a robot, why'd
they put Murphy in there in the first place?

274
00:29:51,703 --> 00:29:54,001
Murphy's dead, sweetheart,
that's on record.

275
00:29:54,339 --> 00:29:56,807
Mr. Fleck, this is Murphy!

276
00:29:56,975 --> 00:29:59,671
What's left of his face,
his cerebrum, his cerebellum.

277
00:29:59,845 --> 00:30:02,075
Human tissue that's still alive.

278
00:30:02,414 --> 00:30:04,473
How can you interface human
and machine...

279
00:30:04,649 --> 00:30:07,345
...then complain
when the human part makes a decision?

280
00:30:10,489 --> 00:30:13,981
So not only did we get Murphy's
years of training...

281
00:30:14,292 --> 00:30:17,819
...and his law-enforcement skills,
we also inerited...

282
00:30:17,996 --> 00:30:21,898
...his memories, his feelings,
his emotional baggage?

283
00:30:22,267 --> 00:30:27,500
Well, I'd call it his humanity,
but I don't think you know that word.

284
00:30:28,507 --> 00:30:29,667
I see.

285
00:30:31,476 --> 00:30:34,570
You talked me into it.
His emotions: Get rid of them.

286
00:30:35,847 --> 00:30:39,977
Find their location and erase them.
If it wipes out his memory, too bad.

287
00:30:42,420 --> 00:30:45,583
We could cut out
the appropriate circuits by...

288
00:30:46,558 --> 00:30:49,891
...implanting a micro-neuro-barrier.

289
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:57,358
Do it.

290
00:30:58,637 --> 00:31:01,606
I got news for you.
I don't give a shit how smart you are.

291
00:31:01,740 --> 00:31:05,767
OCP owns the cops. That means they
own him, and they own your cute little ass.

292
00:31:06,444 --> 00:31:08,309
Nobody owns me.

293
00:31:08,914 --> 00:31:10,279
Fine.

294
00:31:10,515 --> 00:31:14,281
We want him on the Rehab Team.

295
00:31:14,553 --> 00:31:18,455
That means you make him predictable,
or look for a new job, sweet cheeks.

296
00:31:25,363 --> 00:31:26,955
I think I'm in love.

297
00:31:42,447 --> 00:31:44,711
What's going through your head?

298
00:32:02,033 --> 00:32:03,432
That's his family.

299
00:32:04,269 --> 00:32:06,897
Want me to install
the neuro-barrier, doctor?

300
00:32:07,272 --> 00:32:09,069
No, I can do it.

301
00:32:16,381 --> 00:32:19,282
I think I'd like to be alone with him,
if it's all right.

302
00:32:48,079 --> 00:32:51,071
<i>Alex, I thought
you'd never get home.</i>

303
00:32:56,554 --> 00:33:00,786
Don't let the fact that these people
are homeless sway you.

304
00:33:02,427 --> 00:33:05,021
They're terrorists, pure and simple.

305
00:33:06,364 --> 00:33:10,391
On the screens
are suspected rebel locations.

306
00:33:10,602 --> 00:33:14,595
If these locations appear
on your regular beat, check it out.

307
00:33:14,773 --> 00:33:18,834
Make sure you report
any unusual findings...

308
00:33:20,979 --> 00:33:22,606
Hear what they did to Murphy?

309
00:34:08,593 --> 00:34:09,855
Murphy.

310
00:34:32,951 --> 00:34:35,010
Lewis, you want your body armor?

311
00:34:35,387 --> 00:34:38,015
What? No, I'm off duty.

312
00:34:40,992 --> 00:34:42,721
What's up, anyway?

313
00:34:43,528 --> 00:34:44,688
Do you have family?

314
00:34:45,530 --> 00:34:49,762
Yeah, I have a brother in Pittsburgh,
the one who never calls. You know that.

315
00:34:51,536 --> 00:34:53,299
Robo, are you okay?

316
00:34:53,605 --> 00:34:55,038
I'm fine.

317
00:34:56,641 --> 00:34:58,302
And call me Murphy.

318
00:36:03,975 --> 00:36:05,465
Murphy?

319
00:36:10,982 --> 00:36:12,916
<i>Step out of the building.</i>

320
00:36:34,572 --> 00:36:36,665
Stay right there.

321
00:36:37,075 --> 00:36:38,975
We're police officers.

322
00:36:39,310 --> 00:36:40,436
We don't want you.

323
00:36:40,645 --> 00:36:44,376
We believe there are squatters in there.
Now step away from the door.

324
00:36:44,549 --> 00:36:47,643
They're civilians.
They're just trying to stay warm!

325
00:36:47,852 --> 00:36:50,912
Those people belong
in the nearest rehabilitation center.

326
00:36:54,325 --> 00:36:59,058
Some are terrorists. Step away or you
will be cited for obstructing justice.

327
00:37:04,269 --> 00:37:06,499
I'm not going to ask politely next time.

328
00:37:06,671 --> 00:37:08,070
Step away from the door.

329
00:37:11,609 --> 00:37:13,941
This is your final warning.

330
00:37:27,292 --> 00:37:29,692
You are making a mistake.

331
00:37:33,364 --> 00:37:37,391
- Back off, or there'll be trouble.
- Now you're talking, Murphy.

332
00:37:37,602 --> 00:37:41,436
We're not budging. If you wanna get in,
you'll have to shoot through us.

333
00:37:42,941 --> 00:37:45,739
I don't have a huge problem with that.

334
00:38:13,605 --> 00:38:14,697
Cease fire!

335
00:38:29,387 --> 00:38:30,684
Robocop.

336
00:38:36,594 --> 00:38:38,653
Come on, come on, come on!

337
00:38:44,335 --> 00:38:45,461
Come with us!

338
00:38:47,071 --> 00:38:48,368
Cover me.

339
00:39:27,545 --> 00:39:30,946
Some tough cop I am. Huh, partner?

340
00:39:36,421 --> 00:39:38,685
I'm scared.

341
00:39:40,024 --> 00:39:41,582
Don't be.

342
00:39:41,759 --> 00:39:43,750
It won't hurt long.

343
00:39:46,064 --> 00:39:47,929
Get them for me.

344
00:39:48,933 --> 00:39:50,491
Promise me.

345
00:39:50,668 --> 00:39:52,966
I promise.

346
00:39:55,973 --> 00:39:57,565
Murphy.

347
00:40:07,452 --> 00:40:09,283
Officer down.

348
00:40:19,263 --> 00:40:20,457
Move it!

349
00:40:20,598 --> 00:40:23,032
We don't have much time.

350
00:40:23,735 --> 00:40:24,793
Nikko, let's go.

351
00:40:24,969 --> 00:40:27,437
Come on. Come with us.

352
00:40:27,905 --> 00:40:30,271
Is she crazy?
He's a cop! He's one of them!

353
00:40:31,542 --> 00:40:33,373
He's on our side now.

354
00:40:33,544 --> 00:40:35,603
She's right. You saw what he did.

355
00:40:35,780 --> 00:40:38,271
You'll let a stupid kid
make our decisions?

356
00:40:38,449 --> 00:40:41,941
- We're at war. We can use his help.
- Are you kidding me? Look at him!

357
00:40:42,286 --> 00:40:43,776
He is totaled, man!

358
00:40:43,955 --> 00:40:46,515
People, come on.
We don't have time for this shit.

359
00:40:49,794 --> 00:40:50,761
He's right.

360
00:40:52,463 --> 00:40:53,589
We should go.

361
00:41:09,714 --> 00:41:12,512
Five-meter spread.
Search the perimeter.

362
00:41:15,019 --> 00:41:16,077
Damn.

363
00:41:16,420 --> 00:41:20,720
- We're tracking him, sir. He's moving.
- Impossible. The building is surrounded.

364
00:41:21,459 --> 00:41:23,427
He's gone underground.

365
00:41:23,594 --> 00:41:25,027
Find a manole.

366
00:41:49,053 --> 00:41:51,021
We got a little held up.

367
00:42:01,899 --> 00:42:03,526
Rats?

368
00:42:06,337 --> 00:42:07,326
One or two.

369
00:42:13,277 --> 00:42:14,073
Go on through.

370
00:42:24,589 --> 00:42:25,817
Are you okay?

371
00:42:29,861 --> 00:42:31,829
I'm fine.

372
00:42:33,564 --> 00:42:34,690
Hey!

373
00:42:35,766 --> 00:42:37,461
You guys!

374
00:42:41,739 --> 00:42:43,400
Oh, man!

375
00:42:43,641 --> 00:42:45,768
I told you it was a mistake to bring him.

376
00:42:45,977 --> 00:42:47,569
I bet he weighs a ton.

377
00:42:50,581 --> 00:42:52,515
Watch your step.

378
00:42:52,650 --> 00:42:53,708
All right.

379
00:42:54,986 --> 00:42:56,647
Clear the way.

380
00:42:56,821 --> 00:42:59,085
- Get out of the way.
- Hold up your side.

381
00:43:05,730 --> 00:43:06,719
He don't look good.

382
00:43:06,898 --> 00:43:10,857
You wouldn't look so good either
if you took a grenade in your chest.

383
00:43:11,335 --> 00:43:12,802
Tracking.

384
00:43:13,571 --> 00:43:15,004
- Beacon.
- Tracking?

385
00:43:16,874 --> 00:43:18,603
He'll lead them right to us!

386
00:43:18,809 --> 00:43:20,572
Shut up, Coontz!

387
00:43:20,745 --> 00:43:21,973
What's he talking about?

388
00:43:37,461 --> 00:43:40,828
- Did he booby-trap the 8th Street entrance?
- Maybe.

389
00:44:10,094 --> 00:44:12,494
Better get mobilized, folks.

390
00:44:12,997 --> 00:44:16,023
They got a little too close
to home that time.

391
00:44:17,468 --> 00:44:18,992
It's not worth it.

392
00:44:19,337 --> 00:44:21,032
It's not worth this shit!

393
00:44:22,707 --> 00:44:25,471
You better take
a real deep breath right now, Coontz.

394
00:44:25,643 --> 00:44:27,975
Because if you don't think
it's worth it...

395
00:44:28,312 --> 00:44:31,748
...then you're nothing but excess baggage.
Do you hear me?!

396
00:44:33,784 --> 00:44:35,979
You get it together, Coontz.

397
00:44:36,320 --> 00:44:40,017
Cadillac Heights may not be much,
but it's our home.

398
00:44:40,358 --> 00:44:42,019
It's all we got.

399
00:44:42,693 --> 00:44:46,993
If you don't think our homes is worth
it, then tell me what the hell is.

400
00:44:54,005 --> 00:44:56,599
This is Bertha to Base op.
We're coming in.

401
00:44:56,807 --> 00:44:58,775
Set an extra place.

402
00:44:58,976 --> 00:45:01,035
We're bringing in a friend.

403
00:45:08,085 --> 00:45:10,349
<i>Incoming caller.</i>

404
00:45:16,594 --> 00:45:17,561
What do you want?

405
00:45:18,262 --> 00:45:19,854
<i>Nice work, dollface.</i>

406
00:45:20,031 --> 00:45:21,555
What you talking about?

407
00:45:21,732 --> 00:45:24,064
<i>You haven't heard?</i>

408
00:45:24,435 --> 00:45:26,562
<i>You might want to turn on Media Break.</i>

409
00:45:27,805 --> 00:45:30,273
TV on, channel 378.

410
00:45:30,441 --> 00:45:34,400
<i>Witness to the tragic shooting
was Rehab Commander, Paul McDaggett.</i>

411
00:45:36,347 --> 00:45:40,875
<i>All I can say is it's a terrible loss
of a fine public servant.</i>

412
00:45:41,485 --> 00:45:45,387
<i>It's hard to believe that she was
gunned down by her own partner.</i>

413
00:45:46,424 --> 00:45:48,392
<i>An OCP spokesperson has confirmed...</i>

414
00:45:48,526 --> 00:45:51,654
<i>...that Robocop has joined
the terrorist rebel forces.</i>

415
00:45:51,829 --> 00:45:55,822
<i>He is heavily armed and should be
considered extremely dangerous.</i>

416
00:45:56,434 --> 00:45:57,765
TV off.

417
00:45:57,935 --> 00:46:02,065
<i>Congratulations, sweet cheeks.
Now listen up. I want your legendary ass...</i>

418
00:46:02,406 --> 00:46:04,806
<i>...and your corporate I.D. card
in my office...</i>

419
00:46:04,942 --> 00:46:08,969
<i>...by 7:00 a.m. tomorrow. And maybe
you won't be brought up on charges.</i>

420
00:46:09,313 --> 00:46:12,578
<i>Meantime, you might want to decide
whose side you're on.</i>

421
00:46:14,051 --> 00:46:15,848
<i>Sleep tight.</i>

422
00:46:24,862 --> 00:46:28,491
- He what?
- Shot at Rehabs and went underground.

423
00:46:28,666 --> 00:46:32,727
- There goes our P.R. Budget.
- Company line is he's gone renegade.

424
00:46:32,937 --> 00:46:35,405
- How'd the CEO take it?
- How do you think?

425
00:46:35,573 --> 00:46:38,770
Between me and you,
I think the CEO's losing it.

426
00:46:38,943 --> 00:46:41,309
I mean, take a look around, will you?

427
00:46:41,479 --> 00:46:43,504
It's the Fall of Rome around here.

428
00:46:43,681 --> 00:46:46,377
It's Darwin time,
you know what I'm saying?

429
00:46:46,550 --> 00:46:48,677
Survival of the least expendable.

430
00:46:48,853 --> 00:46:52,812
Remember the old man.
Everyone's expendable.

431
00:46:54,391 --> 00:46:57,360
<i>It can't be that bad.</i>

432
00:46:57,561 --> 00:46:59,529
<i>Honey, can you hear me?</i>

433
00:47:00,331 --> 00:47:01,730
<i>Are you there?</i>

434
00:47:03,467 --> 00:47:07,403
<i>Every corporation
goes through this sort of thing.</i>

435
00:47:27,591 --> 00:47:29,889
Oh, my God, what happened?

436
00:47:32,029 --> 00:47:32,996
What's happening?

437
00:47:33,364 --> 00:47:34,956
Arnott just went out the window.

438
00:47:35,299 --> 00:47:38,029
- That's the fourth one this month.
- Chickenshit.

439
00:47:38,402 --> 00:47:40,870
I'd eat a bullet myself.

440
00:47:41,038 --> 00:47:42,596
Less showy.

441
00:47:45,442 --> 00:47:48,309
The writing was on the wall
the minute we hopped...

442
00:47:48,479 --> 00:47:51,710
...in the sack with that shitty
Kanemitsu corporation.

443
00:47:57,288 --> 00:47:58,516
As I was saying...

444
00:48:00,491 --> 00:48:03,460
...we have a warrant out
for Robocop's arrest.

445
00:48:03,627 --> 00:48:08,291
If we can eliminate him, then we'll
find that the squatters are more...

446
00:48:08,465 --> 00:48:11,298
...let's say, easily persuaded.

447
00:48:24,315 --> 00:48:27,284
Fleck. A word with you, son.

448
00:48:27,451 --> 00:48:29,942
I'm sorry for the intrusion, sir.

449
00:48:30,287 --> 00:48:32,380
Anything Security Concepts can do?

450
00:48:32,890 --> 00:48:37,384
Security Concepts can kiss
my freckled butt. You're fired.

451
00:48:38,562 --> 00:48:42,054
You heard me!
You're fired. Get out of here.

452
00:48:50,975 --> 00:48:52,943
Three days until disaster.

453
00:48:53,310 --> 00:48:55,972
What the hell
will I tell my shareholders?

454
00:48:57,014 --> 00:48:58,811
What about more Rehabs, sir?

455
00:48:59,016 --> 00:49:02,543
We could recruit them
out of the Police Department.

456
00:49:03,487 --> 00:49:05,580
It would be cheaper than mercenaries...

457
00:49:05,723 --> 00:49:09,352
...and we could use the Metro West facility
as a staging area.

458
00:49:10,794 --> 00:49:13,388
Give them a nominal raise
for an incentive.

459
00:49:13,564 --> 00:49:15,589
You're a good man, Johnson.

460
00:49:15,766 --> 00:49:18,599
I knew there was a reason
I made you a vice president.

461
00:49:18,769 --> 00:49:19,827
Thank you, sir.

462
00:49:20,004 --> 00:49:21,972
I really...

463
00:50:04,448 --> 00:50:06,416
Heads up!

464
00:50:08,352 --> 00:50:10,582
Come on, let's go. We're gonna be late!

465
00:51:02,506 --> 00:51:03,530
Well?

466
00:51:03,707 --> 00:51:04,935
Can you fix him?

467
00:51:06,877 --> 00:51:09,368
This isn't a valve job on a Chevy.

468
00:51:10,581 --> 00:51:13,379
I never worked
on a damn Robocop before.

469
00:51:13,550 --> 00:51:16,075
- I can do the body work, but...
- Look...

470
00:51:16,420 --> 00:51:19,412
...we gotta hang on to the Heights
for three more days.

471
00:51:20,524 --> 00:51:24,016
- He can hold out till then, can't he?
- Are you listening to me?!

472
00:51:25,863 --> 00:51:28,593
He's messed up.
We don't have the equipment.

473
00:51:28,766 --> 00:51:30,393
Who the hell does?!

474
00:51:31,969 --> 00:51:33,027
Lazarus.

475
00:51:37,608 --> 00:51:40,600
Find doctor...

476
00:51:42,045 --> 00:51:43,273
...Lazarus.

477
00:52:17,591 --> 00:52:19,354
Who are you?

478
00:52:19,526 --> 00:52:21,551
I'm friends with Robocop.

479
00:52:25,265 --> 00:52:27,358
Well, he's not here. I'm sorry.

480
00:52:27,701 --> 00:52:29,134
You don't believe me.

481
00:52:35,642 --> 00:52:38,509
To tell you the truth,
I don't know what to believe anymore.

482
00:52:38,779 --> 00:52:40,713
He had a message for you.

483
00:52:42,115 --> 00:52:46,575
He said to thank you for not
taking his memories away.

484
00:53:07,641 --> 00:53:09,905
Well, well, well.

485
00:53:11,278 --> 00:53:13,439
Afraid you're a little late, pal.

486
00:53:15,682 --> 00:53:18,845
You must be one of Kanemitsu's boys.

487
00:53:19,453 --> 00:53:20,818
I'm impressed.

488
00:53:21,621 --> 00:53:23,145
Trouble is...

489
00:53:26,393 --> 00:53:27,587
...your boss...

490
00:53:29,196 --> 00:53:31,460
...he kind of owns OCP.

491
00:53:31,631 --> 00:53:34,725
And OCP's kind of on our shitlist
with a bullet!

492
00:54:15,809 --> 00:54:18,903
So you want to know
where the rebels are?

493
00:54:19,913 --> 00:54:23,246
You can tell your bosses
to kiss my ass!

494
00:55:03,190 --> 00:55:05,124
A vehicle is approaching.

495
00:56:01,581 --> 00:56:03,208
How you doing, Murphy?

496
00:56:03,717 --> 00:56:05,275
I've been better.

497
00:56:05,652 --> 00:56:08,450
- Give me a status scan.
- Organics intact.

498
00:56:09,189 --> 00:56:12,681
Systems efficiency: 23 percent.

499
00:56:14,194 --> 00:56:16,321
Looks like a direct hit to the heart.

500
00:56:16,696 --> 00:56:19,164
We have to recalibrate
the pneumatic system.

501
00:56:19,332 --> 00:56:20,856
Is he gonna die?

502
00:56:22,903 --> 00:56:24,700
Not if I can help it.

503
00:56:25,639 --> 00:56:28,233
Let's get everything hooked up
to the generator.

504
00:56:28,742 --> 00:56:30,232
We've got work to do.

505
00:56:33,780 --> 00:56:35,270
I'm going to unplug you
for a little while.

506
00:56:36,650 --> 00:56:39,346
Don't worry,
everything's gonna be okay.

507
00:56:45,492 --> 00:56:46,618
Here you go.

508
00:56:48,228 --> 00:56:50,162
I got that heart you wanted.

509
00:56:50,797 --> 00:56:52,856
I said a Nissan. That's a Kanemitsu.

510
00:56:53,433 --> 00:56:56,527
Zack, we need that sealant! Zack!

511
00:56:56,703 --> 00:56:58,694
Marie! Marie! Look!

512
00:56:58,905 --> 00:57:00,532
Oh, shit.

513
00:57:02,742 --> 00:57:04,801
Bring me that chest plate over here.

514
00:57:09,282 --> 00:57:11,443
You wait, man.

515
00:57:11,651 --> 00:57:14,142
You are gonna be so cherry.

516
00:57:14,821 --> 00:57:16,880
Moreno, watch out for the...

517
00:57:17,657 --> 00:57:19,420
What the hell are you doing?

518
00:57:19,593 --> 00:57:22,426
I didn't know that thing was there!

519
00:57:22,596 --> 00:57:25,224
- Don't yell at me!
- Well, don't do it.

520
00:57:41,781 --> 00:57:42,839
Murphy.

521
00:57:43,383 --> 00:57:44,645
It's you.

522
00:57:51,358 --> 00:57:53,883
Alex, I thought you'd never get home.

523
00:58:22,355 --> 00:58:23,913
Welcome home, Murphy.

524
00:58:52,318 --> 00:58:53,342
I couldn't sleep.

525
00:58:53,753 --> 00:58:55,152
How are you feeling?

526
00:58:55,555 --> 00:58:57,921
My efficiency rate is 93 percent.

527
00:58:59,859 --> 00:59:02,259
Anything above 90
is considered normal.

528
00:59:04,264 --> 00:59:06,164
I heard Marie call you Murphy.

529
00:59:07,267 --> 00:59:08,632
Is that your real name?

530
00:59:09,736 --> 00:59:10,828
It was...

531
00:59:11,738 --> 00:59:12,864
...before...

532
00:59:14,474 --> 00:59:15,634
Before what?

533
00:59:28,855 --> 00:59:30,447
So...

534
00:59:33,626 --> 00:59:37,255
Now that you're better, will you stay?

535
00:59:37,430 --> 00:59:38,727
Will you help us?

536
00:59:39,699 --> 00:59:44,159
You know what Bertha says. If we hold
back the Rehabs for two more days...

537
00:59:44,337 --> 00:59:46,168
...they can't make us move.

538
00:59:46,339 --> 00:59:50,901
And they'll have to let my parents go.
We'll all be together like family again.

539
00:59:53,279 --> 00:59:54,610
Your parents?

540
01:00:17,771 --> 01:00:20,137
Murphy? You okay?

541
01:00:20,774 --> 01:00:23,868
Your parents, you miss them?

542
01:00:27,280 --> 01:00:28,406
Yeah.

543
01:00:31,384 --> 01:00:32,373
But...

544
01:00:32,919 --> 01:00:34,318
...you remember them.

545
01:00:36,389 --> 01:00:37,447
Because...

546
01:00:38,591 --> 01:00:40,456
...if you remember them...

547
01:00:41,628 --> 01:00:43,323
...they're never really gone.

548
01:01:04,918 --> 01:01:06,408
Hey, Murphy...

549
01:01:07,787 --> 01:01:10,415
...l'm glad your new heart works.

550
01:01:16,896 --> 01:01:17,885
I heard voices.

551
01:01:24,137 --> 01:01:25,695
She should be in bed.

552
01:01:30,877 --> 01:01:32,435
Could you leave her...

553
01:01:33,513 --> 01:01:34,844
...just a moment?

554
01:01:39,285 --> 01:01:40,274
Of course.

555
01:02:06,846 --> 01:02:08,746
You gotta pay for that.

556
01:02:16,222 --> 01:02:17,780
What are you, deaf?

557
01:02:18,124 --> 01:02:19,216
Son of a...

558
01:02:39,812 --> 01:02:41,541
That's not what we said.

559
01:02:41,714 --> 01:02:44,547
It's not what we said
we were gonna do!

560
01:02:44,717 --> 01:02:47,117
Bertha, you said
to relocate the weapons...

561
01:02:47,287 --> 01:02:49,517
...but where do you want this thing?

562
01:02:51,491 --> 01:02:53,391
Oh, my God.

563
01:02:55,261 --> 01:02:56,785
How did you get this?

564
01:02:57,363 --> 01:02:59,797
We stole it from the police depot. Why?

565
01:03:00,133 --> 01:03:02,897
This looks like the exhaust
system from an F-27.

566
01:03:03,236 --> 01:03:05,602
No. It's the prototype
for Robo's flight pack.

567
01:03:05,772 --> 01:03:09,299
The funding ran out
before we got a chance to test it.

568
01:03:09,442 --> 01:03:12,639
- How do you know so much about it?
- I designed it.

569
01:03:15,281 --> 01:03:19,240
Well, looks like the odds
on the home team just went up.

570
01:03:36,769 --> 01:03:39,397
What I've done
is programmed the command system...

571
01:03:39,572 --> 01:03:42,268
...to take its cues from your hard drive.

572
01:03:42,842 --> 01:03:45,777
I've also rigged it to work as
an auxiliary power unit.

573
01:03:46,112 --> 01:03:49,104
So if you ever have a power drain
like yesterday...

574
01:03:49,282 --> 01:03:53,480
...just interface with the flight pack
and recharge whether you fly or not.

575
01:03:54,253 --> 01:03:56,380
Nikko, see those resistors over there?

576
01:03:56,556 --> 01:03:58,319
Get them for me, will you?

577
01:03:58,491 --> 01:03:59,651
<i>Get them for me, will you?</i>

578
01:04:04,897 --> 01:04:06,694
<i>Get them for me.</i>

579
01:04:07,834 --> 01:04:09,426
<i>Promise me.</i>

580
01:04:11,871 --> 01:04:13,429
<i>Get them for me.</i>

581
01:04:14,907 --> 01:04:16,534
<i>Promise me.</i>

582
01:04:28,254 --> 01:04:29,585
What's going on?

583
01:04:30,189 --> 01:04:31,315
Excuse me.

584
01:04:34,527 --> 01:04:35,755
Hey, where you going?

585
01:04:37,263 --> 01:04:39,356
Unfinished business.

586
01:04:45,505 --> 01:04:47,336
It's okay. He'll be back.

587
01:04:47,507 --> 01:04:49,168
He needs us too.

588
01:04:50,376 --> 01:04:51,468
Where's he going?

589
01:04:53,379 --> 01:04:54,846
To keep a promise.

590
01:04:56,115 --> 01:04:59,175
You got a Robocop.
You got an alien cop?

591
01:04:59,652 --> 01:05:02,212
- Got a ghost cop?
- I don't have time for...

592
01:05:02,388 --> 01:05:03,787
You got a vampire cop?

593
01:05:09,395 --> 01:05:12,387
- Murphy.
- Good evening, Sergeant Reed.

594
01:05:12,732 --> 01:05:15,530
Do you know there's a warrant
out for your arrest?

595
01:05:15,768 --> 01:05:16,792
Yes.

596
01:05:17,103 --> 01:05:19,663
I was just checking.
What can I do for you?

597
01:05:19,839 --> 01:05:22,865
Please direct me
to the Rehab Staging Area.

598
01:05:23,209 --> 01:05:26,110
It's down the hall.
You can't miss it.

599
01:05:26,779 --> 01:05:27,746
Thank you.

600
01:05:32,718 --> 01:05:35,278
You may want to call
the fire department.

601
01:05:46,399 --> 01:05:48,196
- You got a light?
- Sure, man.

602
01:05:48,367 --> 01:05:49,925
Allow me, scum.

603
01:06:21,834 --> 01:06:22,823
Oh, shit.

604
01:06:39,385 --> 01:06:40,750
Where's McDaggett?

605
01:06:56,869 --> 01:06:59,497
<i>That does not look like
a police station.</i>

606
01:06:59,672 --> 01:07:02,197
You're damn right
I'm not at the station.

607
01:07:02,375 --> 01:07:05,572
If my spy hadn't warned me,
I'd be dead now.

608
01:07:06,212 --> 01:07:09,670
I thought your damn ninja was
supposed to take care of Robocop.

609
01:07:09,849 --> 01:07:14,309
That's the deal. I clear the area,
he keeps the robot off my back.

610
01:07:14,887 --> 01:07:18,152
<i>You have the device I sent you?</i>

611
01:07:22,361 --> 01:07:25,387
It hasn't come to that yet.
And it won't. Relax.

612
01:07:25,565 --> 01:07:29,865
<i>It is difficult for me to continue
our business relationship...</i>

613
01:07:30,169 --> 01:07:32,330
<i>...when I don't know your methods.</i>

614
01:07:32,672 --> 01:07:35,163
You don't need to know my methods.

615
01:07:35,341 --> 01:07:38,708
I said I'll clear the area
and I'll clear it.

616
01:07:39,679 --> 01:07:43,308
Just get the robot cop off my back.

617
01:07:55,828 --> 01:08:00,458
I understand you're willing to pay good
money to know where the rebel base is.

618
01:08:00,633 --> 01:08:01,622
Yes, well...

619
01:08:03,736 --> 01:08:05,260
...the money's good...

620
01:08:06,739 --> 01:08:07,865
...if the tip's good.

621
01:08:13,813 --> 01:08:16,907
The last tip saved your ass,
didn't it?

622
01:08:34,533 --> 01:08:36,194
What do we have here?

623
01:08:37,169 --> 01:08:38,659
You don't like men in uniform?

624
01:08:38,838 --> 01:08:41,705
My dad lost his job.
I just need some money.

625
01:08:41,874 --> 01:08:45,241
- We've got lots of money, honey.
- Don't.

626
01:08:45,811 --> 01:08:48,211
- No!
- She said, "No."

627
01:08:50,816 --> 01:08:53,114
Maybe you have a hearing problem?

628
01:08:58,190 --> 01:08:59,487
Go home, young lady.

629
01:09:00,760 --> 01:09:02,728
You are in violation of curfew.

630
01:09:14,273 --> 01:09:15,570
Where's McDaggett?

631
01:09:19,111 --> 01:09:20,408
Room 212.

632
01:09:20,613 --> 01:09:21,671
Thank you.

633
01:09:22,782 --> 01:09:24,613
I hope you are insured.

634
01:09:26,319 --> 01:09:27,809
Elevator door sticks!

635
01:09:48,474 --> 01:09:49,498
Don't.

636
01:10:02,188 --> 01:10:04,748
I have a message from officer Lewis.

637
01:10:20,840 --> 01:10:22,137
Stop!

638
01:10:24,610 --> 01:10:25,736
Drive!

639
01:10:26,479 --> 01:10:28,344
I said, drive, goddamn it, drive!

640
01:10:37,456 --> 01:10:41,415
My time, my money. I told you
and won't tell you again, understand?

641
01:10:41,594 --> 01:10:44,893
I must commandeer your vehicle
for police use.

642
01:10:45,231 --> 01:10:47,358
What is your problem, sucker?

643
01:10:50,202 --> 01:10:51,863
I mean, officer.

644
01:12:02,741 --> 01:12:03,708
Cover me.

645
01:12:56,262 --> 01:12:57,661
Commander!

646
01:13:20,519 --> 01:13:22,612
What's the deal?

647
01:13:34,433 --> 01:13:36,731
Where the hell is Robocop?

648
01:13:38,437 --> 01:13:41,531
We could drive around
and listen for explosions.

649
01:13:49,281 --> 01:13:50,270
Are you doing that?

650
01:13:50,449 --> 01:13:53,646
I got tired of splicing wires,
so I put in a pulse tach decoder.

651
01:13:53,819 --> 01:13:55,650
- Telemetric?
- No.

652
01:13:55,821 --> 01:13:59,120
- Smart ass.
- I know you are, but what am I?

653
01:13:59,792 --> 01:14:01,316
Here, let me try.

654
01:14:12,237 --> 01:14:14,330
Thanks for the heart attack.

655
01:14:14,506 --> 01:14:17,873
I believe I will go
and send out a recon team.

656
01:14:18,410 --> 01:14:20,139
I got a better idea.

657
01:14:20,913 --> 01:14:23,507
Why don't we just all have a seat.

658
01:14:24,316 --> 01:14:25,544
And relax.

659
01:14:26,118 --> 01:14:28,416
It'll all be over in a few minutes.

660
01:14:28,754 --> 01:14:31,120
You son of a bitch.

661
01:14:31,357 --> 01:14:33,757
Watch the language,
there's children present.

662
01:14:37,696 --> 01:14:39,288
Drop it, Coontz.

663
01:14:41,667 --> 01:14:44,534
I'm not going to ask twice.

664
01:14:49,875 --> 01:14:53,140
What do you mean, "it'll all be over
in a few minutes"?

665
01:14:56,215 --> 01:14:58,445
Get the kids out of here! Now!

666
01:15:12,731 --> 01:15:14,323
Bertha!

667
01:15:19,204 --> 01:15:20,171
Go.

668
01:15:23,742 --> 01:15:25,733
- Got to get her.
- Go!

669
01:15:27,479 --> 01:15:29,174
Come on, let's go! Come on!

670
01:15:49,401 --> 01:15:50,629
Come on.

671
01:15:55,441 --> 01:15:57,432
Come on! Get in! Come on!

672
01:15:59,912 --> 01:16:00,879
Come on!

673
01:16:04,516 --> 01:16:05,505
Okay, now go!

674
01:16:06,285 --> 01:16:09,311
- Go on!
- No, it's happening again!

675
01:16:09,488 --> 01:16:11,388
Don't let them take you away.

676
01:16:17,696 --> 01:16:19,357
I said, go! Get out of here!

677
01:16:35,547 --> 01:16:36,673
Where is he?

678
01:16:39,318 --> 01:16:40,307
Go to hell.

679
01:16:40,719 --> 01:16:42,448
Take her to headquarters.

680
01:16:42,654 --> 01:16:45,589
I promise my men won't leave
a mark on you.

681
01:16:51,230 --> 01:16:54,427
Sir. What about our friend Coontz?

682
01:16:55,567 --> 01:16:58,593
If we'd let him live,
we'd have to have paid him.

683
01:17:08,213 --> 01:17:11,512
We're talking about hundreds
of thousands of dollars in damage.

684
01:17:11,683 --> 01:17:14,709
- Murphy can be rough on properties.
- Yeah. Well...

685
01:17:14,887 --> 01:17:18,254
...every cent of it will be coming out
of your salaries.

686
01:17:18,624 --> 01:17:20,683
Hey! You built him!

687
01:17:28,734 --> 01:17:30,395
We're taking Cadillac Heights.

688
01:17:31,103 --> 01:17:35,301
I'll need 50 of your men armed and in full
body armor in one hour. Johnson...

689
01:17:35,507 --> 01:17:40,206
...tell the CEO the demolition crews will
have access at 0600 hours tomorrow.

690
01:17:40,379 --> 01:17:43,815
Hey, we don't do that kind of work.

691
01:17:44,116 --> 01:17:46,277
That was a direct order, sergeant.

692
01:17:46,485 --> 01:17:49,818
Driving people out of their homes
is no work for a cop!

693
01:17:50,155 --> 01:17:51,315
Now, sergeant.

694
01:17:52,691 --> 01:17:56,320
Fifteen years on the force
is quite an investment.

695
01:17:56,528 --> 01:17:58,291
Your job, your pension.

696
01:17:58,597 --> 01:18:03,193
Maybe instead of worrying about these
squatters, think about your own family.

697
01:18:04,336 --> 01:18:05,530
I am.

698
01:18:14,546 --> 01:18:17,413
I'm thinking I have to go home
and face them.

699
01:18:33,732 --> 01:18:35,359
You can't do this.

700
01:18:38,403 --> 01:18:41,201
You are employees of OCP!

701
01:18:41,373 --> 01:18:42,567
Now remember that.

702
01:18:44,476 --> 01:18:47,445
You're jeopardizing
your retirement benefits!

703
01:19:00,459 --> 01:19:01,517
Stop that man.

704
01:19:07,299 --> 01:19:10,268
How would you and your friends
like to make some money?

705
01:19:22,748 --> 01:19:23,680
<i>- It's...
- Johnny...</i>

706
01:19:23,849 --> 01:19:25,214
<i>- Rehab!
- Hurray!</i>

707
01:19:40,232 --> 01:19:44,191
<i>Johnny Rehab action figures, parts
and accessories all sold separately.</i>

708
01:19:45,237 --> 01:19:47,432
<i>Three nuns and five clergy are dead...</i>

709
01:19:47,606 --> 01:19:51,804
<i>...in what is believed to be the latest
atrocity by the killer cyborg, Robocop.</i>

710
01:19:52,244 --> 01:19:54,303
<i>The OCP claim the former police unit...</i>

711
01:19:54,479 --> 01:19:57,346
<i>...is responsible for a spree
of terrorism...</i>

712
01:19:57,516 --> 01:20:01,350
<i>...in the Cadillac Heights section
of Old Detroit.</i>

713
01:20:02,254 --> 01:20:04,279
<i>I'm sorry, I can't even read this.</i>

714
01:20:05,390 --> 01:20:07,790
<i>This is bullshit!
Are you buying this?</i>

715
01:20:08,927 --> 01:20:12,260
Are you kidding me? Robocop?

716
01:21:14,226 --> 01:21:15,523
Marie.

717
01:21:28,740 --> 01:21:30,332
Lousy sons of bitches!

718
01:21:31,243 --> 01:21:34,644
<i>- OCP bastards!
- Nobody is listening to you, sweetheart.</i>

719
01:21:37,783 --> 01:21:39,250
<i>We are in position.</i>

720
01:21:39,418 --> 01:21:43,354
This is Big Stick. You have a green.
Arm and proceed to strike zone.

721
01:21:44,122 --> 01:21:46,317
<i>All teams, we have a green.</i>

722
01:21:46,525 --> 01:21:49,153
<i>All teams, we have a green.</i>

723
01:21:50,195 --> 01:21:51,594
Hey, take it easy.

724
01:22:15,854 --> 01:22:18,846
- So what now?
- What now?

725
01:22:19,257 --> 01:22:22,749
- Game's over, Moreno. Just shut up.
- What about Bertha's plan?

726
01:22:23,395 --> 01:22:25,420
Damn it! Bertha's dead!

727
01:22:28,733 --> 01:22:30,360
I'm sorry.

728
01:22:54,326 --> 01:22:56,624
Folks, in about 45 minutes...

729
01:22:56,761 --> 01:23:00,128
...the Rehabs are coming
to blow you out of your neighborhood.

730
01:23:00,298 --> 01:23:01,697
I want you to take your kids...

731
01:23:01,900 --> 01:23:05,358
...and anybody who shouldn't be fighting
to the basement!

732
01:23:06,104 --> 01:23:10,234
The rest of you are hereby deputized
by the Detroit Police Department.

733
01:23:12,210 --> 01:23:15,111
It's time to show
how real cops kick ass.

734
01:24:31,356 --> 01:24:34,621
Detroit Police! Identify yourself.

735
01:24:39,831 --> 01:24:42,527
You are under arrest
for assaulting an officer.

736
01:24:53,511 --> 01:24:56,207
And destruction of police property.

737
01:25:37,355 --> 01:25:38,413
Quiet!

738
01:25:38,590 --> 01:25:39,784
Quiet!

739
01:25:43,662 --> 01:25:47,894
Hold your fire
until absolutely necessary.

740
01:27:15,320 --> 01:27:16,344
Commander...

741
01:27:16,521 --> 01:27:19,752
...Detroit Police are out there, sir.
They're fighting against us.

742
01:27:19,924 --> 01:27:22,757
So? We have a schedule to keep.

743
01:27:22,927 --> 01:27:26,624
We don't fire on police officers!
You're out of line, McDaggett.

744
01:27:26,798 --> 01:27:29,232
I'm in charge here. I'm pulling the plug.

745
01:27:29,634 --> 01:27:30,760
Sit down.

746
01:27:31,136 --> 01:27:32,535
Have you gone war-wacky?

747
01:27:36,207 --> 01:27:39,370
I said, sit down.

748
01:27:42,113 --> 01:27:43,239
Good idea.

749
01:27:50,288 --> 01:27:51,778
How are we getting out of here anyway?

750
01:27:56,161 --> 01:27:58,220
How'd you get...? Never mind.

751
01:27:58,396 --> 01:28:00,125
Is there a transmission dish outside?

752
01:28:00,298 --> 01:28:03,699
Yeah, and I was just watching
the Media Break guy pick his nose.

753
01:28:03,868 --> 01:28:05,802
Do you have your computer with you?

754
01:28:10,508 --> 01:28:11,839
<i>People of Detroit...</i>

755
01:28:12,243 --> 01:28:15,735
<i>...this is an illegal broadcast.
It may be cut off at any time.</i>

756
01:28:15,914 --> 01:28:17,575
<i>So listen to me.</i>

757
01:28:17,749 --> 01:28:19,683
<i>OCP is lying to you.</i>

758
01:28:19,851 --> 01:28:22,411
<i>They're destroying people's lives
for big business.</i>

759
01:28:26,858 --> 01:28:28,485
<i>Those Rehabs you see on TV...</i>

760
01:28:28,693 --> 01:28:33,221
<i>...they're mercenaries hired by OCP
to throw people out of their homes.</i>

761
01:28:41,873 --> 01:28:43,773
<i>You've got to believe me.</i>

762
01:28:44,509 --> 01:28:47,444
<i>I'm speaking for all the homeless
and jobless citizens of this city...</i>

763
01:28:47,612 --> 01:28:51,776
<i>...and every city like it run by
heartless capitalist scumbags...</i>

764
01:29:00,892 --> 01:29:05,295
<i>OCP doesn't care about people.
OCP cares about...</i>

765
01:29:09,801 --> 01:29:12,827
<i>Your neighborhood is next
unless you fight back now.</i>

766
01:29:13,171 --> 01:29:15,696
<i>Time's running out. OCP's the enemy.</i>

767
01:29:18,443 --> 01:29:23,403
<i>I repeat. Time is running out.
OCP is the enemy.</i>

768
01:29:23,815 --> 01:29:26,249
<i>Help us. Innocent people are dying.</i>

769
01:29:56,114 --> 01:29:58,139
- More ammo!
- More ammo!

770
01:30:19,804 --> 01:30:20,793
Zack's hit!

771
01:30:26,878 --> 01:30:29,403
They're winning, aren't they, sergeant?

772
01:30:40,892 --> 01:30:42,621
What in the name...?

773
01:31:12,190 --> 01:31:13,452
Sir?

774
01:31:27,538 --> 01:31:30,132
Splatter that, you sons of bitches!

775
01:31:49,127 --> 01:31:50,526
<i>Come in, Big Stick.</i>

776
01:31:54,666 --> 01:31:57,157
All right, Mr. Robocop.

777
01:31:57,402 --> 01:31:58,699
Come and get me.

778
01:32:02,874 --> 01:32:04,398
Get away from the door.

779
01:32:18,756 --> 01:32:20,280
Think it over.

780
01:32:22,293 --> 01:32:25,319
Oh, my God, Johnson,
our stock has dropped to nothing.

781
01:32:25,596 --> 01:32:26,688
We're ruined.

782
01:32:45,683 --> 01:32:47,776
How may I help you, officer?

783
01:32:48,286 --> 01:32:49,913
By resisting arrest.

784
01:32:50,254 --> 01:32:52,154
Don't count on it, chum.

785
01:32:52,557 --> 01:32:54,457
Anyway, what's the charge?

786
01:32:54,625 --> 01:32:57,287
The murder of Anne Lewis.

787
01:32:59,230 --> 01:33:01,755
Dead or alive, you're coming with me.

788
01:33:28,926 --> 01:33:33,886
McDaggett, you can have OCP.
It's all yours. Sayonara.

789
01:33:34,232 --> 01:33:35,722
Where're you going?

790
01:33:35,900 --> 01:33:37,834
You're gonna miss all the fun.

791
01:34:25,783 --> 01:34:28,650
No flashy bravery, tin man.

792
01:34:28,820 --> 01:34:30,879
Or the two cuties say, "Bye-bye."

793
01:34:31,422 --> 01:34:33,185
What are you doing?

794
01:34:33,357 --> 01:34:34,756
What are you doing?

795
01:34:42,900 --> 01:34:45,232
Stop them! Stop them!

796
01:34:54,879 --> 01:34:57,109
Stupid fools!

797
01:34:57,281 --> 01:34:59,772
Don't you know what you've done to us?!

798
01:35:00,818 --> 01:35:04,117
Those androids are programmed
with a thermal fail-safe device.

799
01:35:05,756 --> 01:35:07,485
You mean to self-destruct?

800
01:35:07,692 --> 01:35:10,320
In 15 seconds,
everything within 20 yards...

801
01:35:10,494 --> 01:35:12,894
...of where we're standing
will be atomized.

802
01:35:13,231 --> 01:35:15,597
We're dead, you stupid slag.

803
01:35:15,766 --> 01:35:18,234
Don't count on it, chum.

804
01:35:27,478 --> 01:35:29,207
Hang on.

805
01:35:52,870 --> 01:35:56,169
- Come on.
- Let me give you a hand.

806
01:36:23,734 --> 01:36:26,202
Kanemitsu-san...

807
01:36:26,404 --> 01:36:28,372
...I realize that it looks bad...

808
01:36:28,539 --> 01:36:31,406
...but maybe our plans were
over-ambitious.

809
01:36:31,575 --> 01:36:34,135
Let's start a skoshy bit smaller.

810
01:36:34,312 --> 01:36:37,907
Let's gentrify this neighborhood.
Build strip malls.

811
01:36:38,249 --> 01:36:42,242
Fast-food chains. Lots of popular
entertainment. What do you think?

812
01:36:48,225 --> 01:36:49,715
- What did he say?
- You're fired.

813
01:37:19,523 --> 01:37:21,548
I got to hand it to you.

814
01:37:22,727 --> 01:37:24,319
What do they call you?

815
01:37:24,795 --> 01:37:26,763
Murphy, is it?

816
01:37:26,831 --> 01:37:29,129
My friends call me Murphy.

817
01:37:32,403 --> 01:37:33,802
You call me...

818
01:37:34,105 --> 01:37:35,436
...Robocop.
