Yeah.

00:05:56,220 --> 00:05:57,721
What time did
she get home?

5
00:05:57,722 --> 00:06:00,591
Hard to tell.

6
00:06:00,592 --> 00:06:03,761
- You got a cigarette, boy?
- No.

7
00:06:03,762 --> 00:06:06,330
Shut the door.
I gotta get some sleep.

00:07:03,855 --> 00:07:06,007
I took a ride

Ain't nothing changed.

00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:31,749
Messing with

Hell, yeah, man,

Hey, honestly...

37
00:08:19,363 --> 00:08:22,066
This town sucks, Sean.

38
00:08:22,067 --> 00:08:25,002
So why don't

No, come on, Chris,

62
00:09:33,271 --> 00:09:34,805
I can't say.

63
00:09:34,806 --> 00:09:36,473
<i>You can't say 'cause</i>
<i>you didn't get shit.</i>

64
00:09:36,474 --> 00:09:38,809
You wanna smell my Dick?
I still ain't showered.

65
00:09:38,810 --> 00:09:40,978

66
00:09:44,816 --> 00:09:46,750
Taste that.

Yo, you got something

I don't know, man.

78
00:11:04,095 --> 00:11:07,197
I got into it again
last night with Mason.

79
00:11:07,198 --> 00:11:09,233
Fucking redneck Mason?

80
00:11:09,234 --> 00:11:11,601
About what?

81
00:11:13,872 --> 00:11:16,774
I can't even
remember, man.

82
00:11:16,775 --> 00:11:18,809
Yo, don't kill that, man.

83
00:11:18,810 --> 00:11:21,145
Yeah, he don't remember
'cause he got his head beat in.

84
00:11:21,146 --> 00:11:24,381
Fuck that noise, Chris.
I bested that fool.

85
00:11:24,382 --> 00:11:27,350
- You wanna bet?
- Yeah, I wanna bet
if Sean was there,

86
00:11:27,351 --> 00:11:29,719
That shit wouldn't
have happened.

87
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:31,221
You'd have my back,
right, Sean?

88
00:11:31,222 --> 00:11:33,356
Hell's yeah, I would
have had your back.

Always, my nigga,
always.

<i>I saw him</i>

You can
knock him out, Sean.

96
00:11:53,278 --> 00:11:55,846
What, now?

97
00:11:55,847 --> 00:11:58,949
<i>Yeah, let's roll.</i>

Thought you said
he was here, Chris.

106
00:14:06,377 --> 00:14:08,312
Must have bounced.

107
00:14:15,353 --> 00:14:17,654
Let's go talk to PJ.

108

Hey, boy, get that camera
out of my face, man.

Man, not this fool again.

Don't come near me
with that camera, Chris.

00:17:10,027 --> 00:17:11,328
<i>All right, then.</i>

156
00:17:11,329 --> 00:17:14,964
Guess I'll just smoke
this joint.

157

Joint? Wait, my bad.
Come here, Chris.

- So you seen her?
- <i>No.</i>

Well, I'm saying what are
you gonna do for the camera?

166
00:17:43,727 --> 00:17:46,129

Just make out
a little bit for the camera?

170
00:17:53,504 --> 00:17:55,905
God, he is such a perv.

171
00:17:55,906 --> 00:17:58,875
No shit. Try saying that shit

Yeah, fuck Jason.
I hope he dies.

You wanna smoke or what?

174
00:18:04,582 --> 00:18:07,484
All right,

00:18:30,374 --> 00:18:33,976
Let's go now!

179
00:18:33,977 --> 00:18:36,680
Take this, little man.
Take that shit!

180
00:18:44,988 --> 00:18:47,890
( panting )

181
00:19:32,936 --> 00:19:36,806
- I'm calling Ma.
- No!

182
00:19:38,309 --> 00:19:41,711
No! No!

183
00:19:41,712 --> 00:19:43,580
Then tell me.

184
00:19:43,581 --> 00:19:45,382
It's none of your business.

185
00:19:45,383 --> 00:19:48,318
What do you mean it's none
of my business?

186
00:20:01,799 --> 00:20:05,001
Please don't call.

187
00:20:08,972 --> 00:20:11,874
Tell me who hurt you.

188
00:20:20,851 --> 00:20:22,818
Jason.

189
00:20:25,656 --> 00:20:28,458
<i>Jason who?</i>

190
00:20:37,968 --> 00:20:40,036
Jason Patton.

191
00:22:27,077 --> 00:22:28,778
Yo, Mikey!

192
00:22:35,686 --> 00:22:37,853
Yo, Mikey, wake up.

193
00:22:43,093 --> 00:22:45,061
Mikey!

194
00:22:47,531 --> 00:22:50,032
<i>Man, chill the fuck out.</i>

195
00:22:50,033 --> 00:22:53,436
<i>It's early in the morning</i>
<i>and shit, man.</i>

196
00:22:53,437 --> 00:22:55,438
<i>Shit.</i>

197
00:22:55,439 --> 00:22:59,108
Open the door, man.

198
00:22:59,109 --> 00:23:01,110
It's Sabrina, yo.

199
00:23:01,111 --> 00:23:03,613
Where's Sabrina, man?

200
00:23:03,614 --> 00:23:05,615
Where's your brother?

201
00:23:05,616 --> 00:23:10,920
He's asleep, just like I was
before you came knocking
on my door, man.

202
00:23:10,921 --> 00:23:14,790
I can't believe this
motherfucker raped her, man.

203
00:23:14,791 --> 00:23:16,626
Who raped her, my brother?

204
00:23:16,627 --> 00:23:19,895
No, man, Jason Patton.

205
00:23:19,896 --> 00:23:22,498
- Who's Jason Patton?
- Yo, get your brother.

206
00:23:22,499 --> 00:23:24,734
Damn, all right, chill.

207
00:23:24,735 --> 00:23:26,769
Shit.

208
00:23:29,106 --> 00:23:30,673
Damn.

209
00:23:33,244 --> 00:23:36,145
You want something to drink?

210
00:23:38,815 --> 00:23:43,486
She got a black eye, okay?

211
00:23:43,487 --> 00:23:45,355
He raped her!

212
00:23:45,356 --> 00:23:47,357
Beat her up and shit.

213
00:23:47,358 --> 00:23:50,192
<i>What we gonna do?</i>

214
00:23:54,498 --> 00:23:56,666
We're gonna kill him.
What the fuck you think?

215
00:23:56,667 --> 00:23:58,768
Shit.

216
00:24:00,771 --> 00:24:04,140
All right, chill, woot.
We got you.

217
00:24:06,477 --> 00:24:09,979
Hey, yo. Big head.

218
00:24:09,980 --> 00:24:12,682
<i>Get up, man.</i>

219
00:24:12,683 --> 00:24:16,018
<i>Somebody raped</i>
<i>your girl, man.</i>

220
00:24:16,019 --> 00:24:17,720
<i>What?</i>

221
00:24:17,721 --> 00:24:20,623
<i>Yeah, Reggie's out front</i>

222
00:24:20,624 --> 00:24:23,092
<i>Waiting for us, man.</i>

223
00:24:23,093 --> 00:24:26,262
<i>We gotta go kill somebody.</i>

224
00:24:26,263 --> 00:24:29,699
- <i>Now?</i>
- <i>Yeah, now.</i>

225
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:32,602
<i>Give me another</i>
<i>20 minutes.</i>

226
00:24:42,979 --> 00:24:45,448
<i>It's like that now, huh?</i>

227
00:24:45,449 --> 00:24:50,720
You just go hood to hood
just smoking in people's
houses and shit, huh?

228
00:24:50,721 --> 00:24:52,855
My bad, man.

229
00:24:58,529 --> 00:25:00,596
Give me some of that shit.

230
00:25:00,597 --> 00:25:02,732
Need to get a burner, yo.

231
00:25:02,733 --> 00:25:05,267
Take me to see
your uncle, Mikey.

232
00:25:05,268 --> 00:25:07,337
Oh, hell no.

233
00:25:07,338 --> 00:25:08,838
Come on, I'm serious.

234
00:25:08,839 --> 00:25:10,473
<i>Man, you must be</i>
<i>crazy as hell</i>

235
00:25:10,474 --> 00:25:14,176
If you think I'm going
to see that redneck, man.

236
00:25:14,177 --> 00:25:16,946
It's my sister, yo.

237
00:25:20,884 --> 00:25:23,219
<i>Hey, yo,</i>
<i>who's Jason, man?</i>

238
00:25:23,220 --> 00:25:25,388
You know Jason, man.

239
00:25:25,389 --> 00:25:29,191
Fucking white boy used
to be on my varsity squad.

240
00:25:29,192 --> 00:25:33,028
<i>White boy on varsity?</i>

241
00:25:33,029 --> 00:25:35,097
- <i>Smooth dude?</i>
- Yeah.

242
00:25:35,098 --> 00:25:36,899
Yeah, that motherfucker.

243
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:40,803
Nigga was-- you sure he even
knew your sister, man?

244
00:25:40,804 --> 00:25:42,839
Man, that's what she said,
all right?

245
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:44,674
<i>All right.</i>
<i>Damn, man, chill.</i>

246
00:25:44,675 --> 00:25:47,477
<i>What are you coming at me for?</i>
<i>Shit, man.</i>

247
00:25:53,049 --> 00:25:55,385
Get my brother.

248
00:25:55,386 --> 00:25:59,021
Who the fuck he think he is?
I'm a grown-ass man.

249
00:26:09,266 --> 00:26:12,234
Get up, get up!

250
00:26:12,235 --> 00:26:14,637
Somebody raped
my sister.

251
00:26:14,638 --> 00:26:17,740
Your girl.
So get your shit,

252
00:26:17,741 --> 00:26:20,710
then we'll shoot
his fucking face off!

253
00:26:25,649 --> 00:26:29,285
- He up?
- Let's go!

254
00:26:29,286 --> 00:26:31,220
All right.

255
00:26:43,667 --> 00:26:47,437
- Hey, yo, nigga,
don't kill that!
- Oh, yeah, don't kill it, huh?

256
00:26:47,438 --> 00:26:49,806
Gimme that shit, man.

257
00:26:52,042 --> 00:26:54,944
Young wannabe gangster.

258
00:26:54,945 --> 00:26:58,347
- <i>Let's go, dawg!</i>
- Oh, dawg.

259
00:26:58,348 --> 00:27:00,082
Let's ride.

260
00:27:06,990 --> 00:27:09,258
<i>( hip-hop song playing )</i>

261
00:28:18,829 --> 00:28:22,297
Where's your
uncle's house, man?

262
00:28:24,467 --> 00:28:27,369
Mikey.

263
00:28:27,370 --> 00:28:29,438
<i>It's right up here, man.</i>

264
00:28:29,439 --> 00:28:32,008
James:
<i>Why we going to my uncle's?</i>

265
00:28:32,009 --> 00:28:34,443
Mikey:
<i>Because Reggie want a gun.</i>

266
00:28:34,444 --> 00:28:38,347
Man, you know that fool crazy.
You know he's crazy, Reg.

267
00:28:38,348 --> 00:28:42,451
<i>Well, we going anyway,</i>
<i>so shut the fuck up!</i>

268
00:28:42,452 --> 00:28:45,721
Damn, man, why you
gotta yell at me and shit?

269
00:29:09,379 --> 00:29:11,547
No, man, I'm good.

270
00:29:11,548 --> 00:29:15,017
Gotta take a piss test
for this job interview.

271
00:29:15,018 --> 00:29:17,019
Nigga, that's why
you dressed up

272
00:29:17,020 --> 00:29:19,021
like you going
to church, man?

273
00:29:19,022 --> 00:29:21,591
<i>Yeah, nigga, that's why.</i>

274
00:29:21,592 --> 00:29:23,626
What time is
your interview?

275
00:29:23,627 --> 00:29:26,596
Like a half-hour, man.
That's why we gotta kill
this motherfucker quick.

276
00:29:30,533 --> 00:29:33,135
Is there something funny
about this situation,

277
00:29:33,136 --> 00:29:34,870
Mikey, huh?

278
00:29:34,871 --> 00:29:37,406
No, man.

279
00:29:42,579 --> 00:29:45,280
You're right, my bad.

280
00:29:50,253 --> 00:29:52,521
Right here, man.

281
00:30:17,748 --> 00:30:19,849
What up, woot?

282
00:30:19,850 --> 00:30:22,852
Auntie!

283
00:30:25,321 --> 00:30:28,223
<i>What y'all</i>
<i>little fuckers want?</i>

284
00:30:28,224 --> 00:30:31,727
- <i>Mikey, is that you?</i>
- Yeah, it's me.
How are you?

285
00:30:31,728 --> 00:30:33,663
How do I look?

286
00:30:37,901 --> 00:30:40,836
- I'm here to see my uncle.
- He ain't here.

287
00:30:40,837 --> 00:30:43,639
I kicked
his skinny little ass
out last night.

288
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:46,575
I'll be god damned
if that coward lay
one more hand on me.

289
00:30:46,576 --> 00:30:48,911
And if you see him,
tell him to come around
here one more time.

290
00:30:48,912 --> 00:30:52,548
I'm gonna cut
his motherfucking
dick off, you heard me?

291
00:30:54,751 --> 00:30:56,986
- Damn!
- Yes, ma'am.

292
00:30:58,855 --> 00:31:01,691
Something went down
last night.

293
00:31:01,692 --> 00:31:04,493
You think?

294
00:31:04,494 --> 00:31:07,396
Take care of your
mama, Woot.

295
00:31:30,921 --> 00:31:34,223
- Woman: <i>Who there?</i>
- It's Mikey.

296
00:31:38,995 --> 00:31:41,330
Hi, Mikey.

297
00:31:41,331 --> 00:31:43,398
I haven't seen you
in a while.

298
00:31:43,399 --> 00:31:45,467
Y'all wanna come in?

299
00:31:45,468 --> 00:31:48,403
No, I'm looking for my uncle.
Have you seen him?

300
00:31:48,404 --> 00:31:50,806
Yeah, he tried to come
over last night,

301
00:31:50,807 --> 00:31:53,075
but I wasn't having that.

302
00:31:53,076 --> 00:31:55,811
So where he went?

303
00:31:55,812 --> 00:31:57,913
Probably the Wolf Trap
or something.

304
00:31:57,914 --> 00:32:00,149
Wolf Trap Motel?

305
00:32:00,150 --> 00:32:02,384
<i>Everything all right?</i>

306
00:32:02,385 --> 00:32:06,155
Pretty far
fucking from it.

307
00:32:06,156 --> 00:32:09,225
Mikey, what's up?

308
00:32:09,226 --> 00:32:11,193
Why don't you come in?

309
00:32:11,194 --> 00:32:14,263
Some other time.

310
00:32:14,264 --> 00:32:16,598
- Bye.
- <i>Yeah.</i>

311
00:32:57,507 --> 00:32:59,708
That's his van.

312
00:33:04,815 --> 00:33:07,316
Now let me
do the talking,
all right?

313
00:33:07,317 --> 00:33:10,585
Whatever, man.

314
00:33:10,586 --> 00:33:12,521
Come on, James.

315
00:33:12,522 --> 00:33:14,523
I ain't going in.

316
00:33:14,524 --> 00:33:17,726
- Why not?
- I just don't want to.

317
00:34:09,612 --> 00:34:11,680
Go see, go see.

318
00:34:53,623 --> 00:34:56,025
What do you got?

319
00:34:56,026 --> 00:34:58,294
Reggie:
<i>I got $40</i>

320
00:34:58,295 --> 00:35:00,930
And this ring.

321
00:35:46,109 --> 00:35:49,845
It ain't worth shit.

322
00:35:49,846 --> 00:35:52,547
<i>That's my mom's ring.</i>

323
00:36:02,993 --> 00:36:05,027
So you gonna give me
the gun or what?

324
00:36:05,028 --> 00:36:09,131
Why don't you just
sit down?

325
00:36:09,132 --> 00:36:13,235
- <i>I don't wanna sit down.</i>
- You're making Jim nervous.

326
00:36:20,776 --> 00:36:24,980
Sit down, man,
sit down.

327
00:36:24,981 --> 00:36:28,150
<i>Will you please</i>
<i>sit down?</i>

328
00:36:28,151 --> 00:36:30,252
I said I don't wanna
sit down!

329
00:36:30,253 --> 00:36:33,588
I wanna get the fucking burner
so I can get the fuck
up out of here,

330
00:36:33,589 --> 00:36:36,791
so quit playing games
and hand the shit over.

331
00:36:39,929 --> 00:36:43,265
I hate motherfuckers
like you.

332
00:36:45,502 --> 00:36:47,903
Got no respect
for your elders.

333
00:36:47,904 --> 00:36:50,972
<i>You just make choices</i>

334
00:36:50,973 --> 00:36:52,707
<i>without having</i>
<i>to pay the consequences.</i>

335
00:36:52,708 --> 00:36:55,777
Let me tell you
something, boy.

336
00:36:55,778 --> 00:36:58,280
You're going to pay.

337
00:36:58,281 --> 00:37:00,849
<i>You'll pay!</i>

338
00:37:03,653 --> 00:37:05,820
<i>You done?</i>

339
00:37:05,821 --> 00:37:08,424
- Huh?
- What?

340
00:37:08,425 --> 00:37:10,892
What?

341
00:37:10,893 --> 00:37:12,594
The sad thing is

342
00:37:12,595 --> 00:37:14,263
this whole motherfucking
beautiful country

343
00:37:14,264 --> 00:37:16,998
being run by motherfucker
who are just like you.

344
00:37:16,999 --> 00:37:20,302
These little...

345
00:37:20,303 --> 00:37:24,139
quick trigger motherfuckers
just like you.

346
00:37:24,140 --> 00:37:27,276
Just like you.

347
00:37:27,277 --> 00:37:30,979
They think they bulletproof.

348
00:37:30,980 --> 00:37:34,183
- Huh, huh?
- <i>Let him go, man!</i>

349
00:37:34,184 --> 00:37:36,952
Come on, Unc,
let him go, man.

350
00:37:36,953 --> 00:37:39,455
Think you're bulletproof?
You ain't bulletproof.

351
00:37:39,456 --> 00:37:42,324
Ain't none of us
bulletproof.

352
00:37:42,325 --> 00:37:44,326
You wake up
tomorrow morning,

530
00:53:36,211 --> 00:53:38,513
I'm over here getting
my ass kicked,

531
00:53:38,514 --> 00:53:41,916
and you're fucking
videotaping shit
in a shed, huh?

532
00:53:41,917 --> 00:53:44,519
<i>Yo, chill, dawg.</i>
<i>It's all good now, right?</i>

533
00:53:44,520 --> 00:53:47,255
No-- dawg?
It ain't all good.

534
00:53:47,256 --> 00:53:49,257
You straight-up pussy.

535
00:53:49,258 --> 00:53:51,259
How come every time
shit goes down,

536
00:53:51,260 --> 00:53:53,428
you manage to be somewhere
else, Chris, huh?

537
00:53:53,429 --> 00:53:54,962
<i>Yo, come on, man,</i>
<i>it ain't like that.</i>

538
00:53:54,963 --> 00:53:57,631
Yeah, fuck it is
like that, Chris.
Look at me.

539
00:53:57,632 --> 00:53:59,700
I'm tired of you fucking
dick-riding me, man.

540
00:53:59,701 --> 00:54:01,702
Always following
me around and shit.

541
00:54:01,703 --> 00:54:04,439
I already got a fucking shadow.
You know what I'm saying, huh?

542
00:54:04,440 --> 00:54:06,941
<i>Yo, J, why you</i>
<i>saying this, man?</i>
<i>I'm your boy.</i>

543
00:54:06,942 --> 00:54:10,244
Why am I saying this?
'cause I ain't your
fucking boy, Chris!

544
00:54:10,245 --> 00:54:13,281
And get the fucking camera
out of my face.

545
00:54:13,282 --> 00:54:15,383
Yo, chill, man,
what did I do?

546
00:54:15,384 --> 00:54:17,585
What did you do?
Walk on, that's what
you need to do!

547
00:54:17,586 --> 00:54:20,821
- What did I do?
- Candace: Just go, Chris.

548
00:55:16,111 --> 00:55:18,613
Sean's coming
home tomorrow.

549
00:55:18,614 --> 00:55:22,383
So things will be
better tomorrow.

550
00:55:23,818 --> 00:55:28,256
Sean and I have been homeys
since we was real little.

551
00:55:28,257 --> 00:55:30,658
This one time
in kindergarten

552
00:55:30,659 --> 00:55:32,860
I was out
on the playground

553
00:55:32,861 --> 00:55:35,863
and I was kind of being
picked on by this dillweed.

554
00:55:35,864 --> 00:55:38,699
I was kind of
being picked on
out on the playground

555
00:55:38,700 --> 00:55:41,869
and Sean came over
and pushed him down

556
00:55:41,870 --> 00:55:43,871
and kicked him
right in his fat face.

557
00:55:43,872 --> 00:55:48,042
Kicked him right
in his fat fucking face.

558
00:55:49,278 --> 00:55:51,779
He's been my best friend
ever since.

559
00:55:55,250 --> 00:55:57,885
And he's got my back
for reals, you know?

- Can I get a ride?
- No.

Where?

582
00:58:10,919 --> 00:58:12,553
A party.
It's right down the street.

583
00:58:12,554 --> 00:58:15,690
- Then walk.
- I can't walk.

You'll be back?

Hey, man, I'm gonna
run her down the street.

Probably, yeah.

<i>Better not be over there</i>

594
00:58:57,366 --> 00:58:59,032

Hey, Candace.

What's up?

611
01:00:55,650 --> 01:00:57,885
Can I talk to you

You can't be doing this shit

- I just wanted to talk.
- Talk about what?

616
01:01:31,886 --> 01:01:33,654
- About us.
- There is no us.

617
01:01:33,655 --> 01:01:36,357
- But what about what happened?
- What about nothing,
nothing happened.

618

- We had sex.
- Yeah, we fucked.

That was a mistake,
all right?

621
01:01:57,579 --> 01:02:00,514
We made a mistake,
that's all.

622
01:02:01,883 --> 01:02:03,617
- I got a girl.
- You already said that.

623
01:02:03,618 --> 01:02:06,653
Yeah, I know,
but this shit can't happen
between us, all right?

- Mason and your brother.
- Well, break it up
or something.

- Was anyone hurt?
- No, but--

662

Well, then no police.
Nobody call the police.

663

What the hell's
going on back there?

01:05:06,735 --> 01:05:09,403
My brother got into a fight,

- No.

Good, where can
we spark this?

In the back,
in the shed.

671
01:05:16,043 --> 01:05:18,879
Jenny, I gotta go.
I'm gonna smoke with Bonnie.

672
01:05:18,880 --> 01:05:21,915
But come over soon
and bring Mark.

673
01:05:21,916 --> 01:05:24,217
No, he won't get shot.

674
01:05:24,218 --> 01:05:25,952

- What?
- I hate that bitch.

678

you two were tight.
- Were.

Nikki, can we go
outside?

683
01:06:15,403 --> 01:06:18,572
Anything you gotta say to me
you can say in front of her.

684

I'm sorry.

You ain't gotta
apologize.

- Right.

687
01:06:35,523 --> 01:06:38,792
We wouldn't do nothing
to hurt each other, right?

688
01:06:38,793 --> 01:06:41,528
- Right, Sabrina?
- Right.

689
01:06:41,529 --> 01:06:44,998
I mean, I wouldn't fuck
your brother. I just wouldn't
do that now, would I?

690
01:06:44,999 --> 01:06:49,102
Right, Sabrina?
And you guys wouldn't fuck
my brother either, right?

691
01:06:49,103 --> 01:06:51,372
Well, I might
fuck your brother.

692
01:06:51,373 --> 01:06:53,474
He's kinda fine.

693
01:06:53,475 --> 01:06:56,042
You wouldn't fuck Jason,
would you, Sabrina, huh?

694

- Nikki--
- Don't touch me, you slut.

01:07:07,822 --> 01:07:10,457
No, don't go.

699
01:07:10,458 --> 01:07:12,493
Let's just all smoke.

700
01:07:30,445 --> 01:07:33,580
- But--
- Smoke it, bitch.

701
01:07:44,158 --> 01:07:45,992
Yeah.

702
01:07:58,773 --> 01:08:02,375
I just got really
fucking high.

703
01:08:04,679 --> 01:08:06,747
Me too.

704
01:09:06,774 --> 01:09:09,242
We smoked something.

705
01:09:14,616 --> 01:09:17,384
I wanna go home.

706
01:09:17,385 --> 01:09:19,352
Can you call
my brother, please?

707
01:09:53,821 --> 01:09:55,522
Chris.

708
01:10:42,570 --> 01:10:45,038
Jason.

709
01:10:45,039 --> 01:10:48,041
Huh?

710
01:10:48,042 --> 01:10:50,276
Jason, is that you?

711
01:10:52,714 --> 01:10:57,050
- No, it's Chris, Jason's--
- Chris.

712
01:10:59,921 --> 01:11:03,356
Why does he have
to be such an asshole?

713
01:11:03,357 --> 01:11:06,159
Did he hurt you?

714
01:11:09,130 --> 01:11:11,331
Yeah.

715
01:11:14,936 --> 01:11:17,203
What did he do?

716
01:11:21,009 --> 01:11:23,376
He broke my heart.

717
01:11:30,217 --> 01:11:32,686
He does that
to everybody.

718
01:11:44,799 --> 01:11:48,201
I know how we can
get back at him.

719
01:11:52,974 --> 01:11:54,875
How?

720
01:12:00,081 --> 01:12:02,382
If you and I...

721
01:12:13,828 --> 01:12:17,397
- Wait, this is stupid.
- No no, this is good.

722
01:12:19,067 --> 01:12:20,734
No, stop.
This is dumb.

723
01:12:20,735 --> 01:12:24,004
No no, this is perfect.
Don't worry.

724
01:12:24,005 --> 01:12:27,074
- No, stop!
- No, I'm in the fucking zone!

725
01:12:28,676 --> 01:12:31,644
- Stop!
- No no no, come on here.

726
01:12:31,645 --> 01:12:35,381
( whimpering )

727
01:12:35,382 --> 01:12:37,417
For Jason, huh?

728
01:12:40,621 --> 01:12:43,389
- Stop it, stop it!
- Stop!

729
01:12:49,463 --> 01:12:51,765
<i>You like that, Jason?</i>

730
01:13:53,761 --> 01:13:55,762
Why'd you miss
the funeral?

731
01:14:07,441 --> 01:14:09,943
Them bullets were meant
for me, man.

732
01:14:12,280 --> 01:14:14,281
I fucked that
little black girl,

733
01:14:14,282 --> 01:14:16,249
Reggie's little sister.

734
01:14:21,122 --> 01:14:25,458
That's why Jason's dead,
right, Sean?

735
01:14:25,459 --> 01:14:27,994
I don't know.
You tell me.

736
01:14:27,995 --> 01:14:30,530
I been home one day
and I had to bury
my best friend.

737
01:14:30,531 --> 01:14:33,099
- You tell me why.
- He was my best friend too.

738
01:14:36,237 --> 01:14:39,539
<i>They shot him</i>
<i>'cause they thought</i>
<i>he was me.</i>

739
01:14:41,375 --> 01:14:43,310
Why?

740
01:14:46,147 --> 01:14:47,914
Did you rape her?

741
01:14:54,621 --> 01:14:57,557
He punked me out
at that party.

742
01:14:57,558 --> 01:15:00,093
- <i>Who?</i>
- Jason. He punked
me out, Sean.

743
01:15:00,094 --> 01:15:03,730
- <i>So?</i>
- I don't know!

744
01:15:03,731 --> 01:15:06,933
So nothing, I guess.

745
01:15:10,004 --> 01:15:12,339
I wish they
would have shot you.

746
01:15:20,514 --> 01:15:22,448
Hey, Sean!

747
01:15:30,358 --> 01:15:32,592
I just don't give a fuck.

748
01:15:37,064 --> 01:15:39,900
<i>( car door opens</i>
<i>and closes )</i>

749
01:15:39,901 --> 01:15:41,868
<i>( engine starts )</i>

750
01:17:55,236 --> 01:17:57,237
<i>( gunshot )</i>
