ELECTRICK CHILDREN

3
00:02:16,593 --> 00:02:18,417
Alright, Rachel...

4
00:02:18,769 --> 00:02:21,010
Let's begin with the prayer.
I'll offer it.

5
00:02:23,762 --> 00:02:27,026
Heavenly Father, we are so
grateful to have the opportunity

6
00:02:27,154 --> 00:02:29,042
to be gathered together here

7
00:02:29,392 --> 00:02:31,697
to interview
Rachel Angela McKnight on this,

8
00:02:31,857 --> 00:02:33,746
her 15th birthday.

9
00:02:34,673 --> 00:02:36,946
We are grateful
for her obedience

10
00:02:37,105 --> 00:02:39,249
and for her great zest for life.

11
00:02:40,242 --> 00:02:43,667
Please bless that this interview
proceed with honesty

12
00:02:43,825 --> 00:02:46,739
and that we may be guided
with the spirit.

13
00:02:47,762 --> 00:02:49,682
We look forward to the day
when the Savior will come.

14
00:02:49,841 --> 00:02:51,409
In His holy name, Amen.

15
00:02:51,569 --> 00:02:53,010
- Amen.
- Amen.

16
00:03:00,401 --> 00:03:01,906
What is that?

17
00:03:02,706 --> 00:03:04,242
That's a cassette tape.

18
00:03:04,561 --> 00:03:05,874
Regulation requires

19
00:03:06,961 --> 00:03:09,042
the oral documentation
of all ecclesiastical interviews

20
00:03:09,201 --> 00:03:11,825
from the ages of 15 and up.

21
00:03:12,625 --> 00:03:13,713
Is it new?

22
00:03:14,065 --> 00:03:15,090
Mmmhmm.

23
00:03:16,402 --> 00:03:18,610
But its purposes
can be used for evil,

24
00:03:18,770 --> 00:03:21,394
so we'll keep it to those
who can be trusted.

25
00:03:24,497 --> 00:03:27,058
Is he staying here
for the interview?

26
00:03:28,082 --> 00:03:31,411
She can trust you,
can't she Mr. Will?

27
00:03:33,394 --> 00:03:35,058
Well, answer her, son.

28
00:03:36,721 --> 00:03:37,906
You can trust me.

29
00:03:38,898 --> 00:03:39,730
Great.

30
00:03:40,914 --> 00:03:43,218
Alright then, Rachel...

31
00:03:43,953 --> 00:03:45,298
Let's begin.

32
00:03:47,153 --> 00:03:48,594
Do you believe in God,
the eternal Father,

33
00:03:48,753 --> 00:03:52,913
that His son Jesus Christ
will come to Earth to save us?

34
00:03:53,041 --> 00:03:56,049
And do you have a firm testimony
of God's commandments?

35
00:03:56,913 --> 00:03:57,682
Yes.

36
00:04:00,017 --> 00:04:03,601
Do you sustain Paul McKnight
as the prophet, seer, revelator

37
00:04:03,762 --> 00:04:06,386
and do you recognize him
as the only person on this earth

38
00:04:06,545 --> 00:04:09,170
authorized to exercise
all priesthood keys?

39
00:04:09,874 --> 00:04:10,577
Yes.

40
00:04:11,504 --> 00:04:13,265
I mean, so far.

41
00:04:14,674 --> 00:04:16,370
Well, fair enough.

42
00:04:17,873 --> 00:04:18,962
Alright, next.

43
00:04:19,792 --> 00:04:21,713
Do you affiliate
with any group or individual

44
00:04:21,873 --> 00:04:24,946
whose teachings or practices
are contrary to or oppose

45
00:04:25,105 --> 00:04:26,898
those accepted by this church?

46
00:04:28,562 --> 00:04:29,393
No.

47
00:04:30,321 --> 00:04:32,305
Unless you count Mr. Will.

48
00:04:34,578 --> 00:04:35,410
Next.

49
00:04:36,241 --> 00:04:38,611
Do you honor
your mother and father?

50
00:04:39,281 --> 00:04:41,361
You can answer that
better than me.

51
00:04:42,769 --> 00:04:43,954
I think you can say yes

52
00:04:45,042 --> 00:04:46,962
and still be pretty close
to the truth now, can't you?

53
00:04:47,792 --> 00:04:51,346
Alright, let's continue
with all seriousness, shall we?

54
00:04:53,010 --> 00:04:54,802
Do you live
by the law of chastity?

55
00:04:55,569 --> 00:04:56,338
Yes.

56
00:05:07,792 --> 00:05:09,106
- Let me see it.
- No!

57
00:05:09,265 --> 00:05:10,321
Then show me how it works.

58
00:05:10,673 --> 00:05:11,890
I just wanna hear
what I sound like.

59
00:05:12,018 --> 00:05:13,553
You sound like a kid!

60
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,347
How did it go?

61
00:05:15,888 --> 00:05:17,425
I think I passed.

62
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:23,986
Mr. Will!

63
00:05:25,137 --> 00:05:26,034
Wait!

64
00:05:26,897 --> 00:05:28,530
This is to be used
for God's purposes.

65
00:05:30,129 --> 00:05:31,058
Rachel!

66
00:05:31,505 --> 00:05:32,946
Leave your brother alone.

67
00:05:39,697 --> 00:05:40,946
Look under the bed.

68
00:05:42,896 --> 00:05:43,922
I can't find it!

69
00:05:44,272 --> 00:05:44,817
Lights out.

70
00:05:46,449 --> 00:05:47,378
Rachel...

71
00:05:48,369 --> 00:05:49,362
I know!

72
00:06:02,193 --> 00:06:04,561
- It's a little small.
- Really small.

73
00:06:04,689 --> 00:06:05,330
It's mine.

74
00:06:06,130 --> 00:06:06,962
Thanks for letting
Rachel borrow it.

75
00:06:08,785 --> 00:06:10,514
Remember to say your prayers.

76
00:06:12,721 --> 00:06:14,418
Can you tell us a story?

77
00:06:15,185 --> 00:06:16,274
It's getting late.

78
00:06:16,433 --> 00:06:18,865
- Please, Mom.
- Please!

79
00:06:20,082 --> 00:06:21,010
Please.

80
00:06:23,824 --> 00:06:25,457
Turn out the light.

81
00:06:29,744 --> 00:06:31,538
Once upon a time,

82
00:06:31,953 --> 00:06:33,361
there was a princess...

83
00:06:33,522 --> 00:06:34,354
No!

84
00:06:34,513 --> 00:06:35,698
Tell us the story.

85
00:06:36,176 --> 00:06:37,073
I am.

86
00:06:37,202 --> 00:06:39,057
No, the one about the Mustang.

87
00:06:39,217 --> 00:06:39,922
What?

88
00:06:40,593 --> 00:06:42,481
The one about the red Mustang.

89
00:06:43,952 --> 00:06:45,073
Did I tell you that?

90
00:06:48,145 --> 00:06:50,514
Ok, but this is
a top secret story,

91
00:06:50,672 --> 00:06:52,306
never to leave this room.

92
00:06:53,104 --> 00:06:55,474
Everyone hold up their hands
like this.

93
00:06:57,681 --> 00:06:59,634
Now holding these peace signs
up like this

94
00:06:59,793 --> 00:07:01,329
and nodding your head,

95
00:07:01,521 --> 00:07:04,242
you swear
to never let this story

96
00:07:04,401 --> 00:07:05,170
leave your mouth.

97
00:07:09,138 --> 00:07:11,506
Once upon a time in a land

98
00:07:11,665 --> 00:07:14,097
just on the other side
of the red bluffs

99
00:07:14,450 --> 00:07:15,665
of southern Utah,

100
00:07:15,888 --> 00:07:16,913
a princess...

101
00:07:17,074 --> 00:07:18,226
You might know her.

102
00:07:19,378 --> 00:07:21,618
She might be in this room,
she might be even telling you

103
00:07:21,744 --> 00:07:23,473
this very story...

104
00:07:24,656 --> 00:07:26,129
...found

105
00:07:27,952 --> 00:07:28,881
a Mustang.

106
00:07:30,832 --> 00:07:32,689
Do you know what a Mustang is?

107
00:07:32,882 --> 00:07:34,161
It's a horse.

108
00:07:35,314 --> 00:07:36,786
It's a hot day.

109
00:07:38,672 --> 00:07:42,290
And I was actually looking for
someone that I had lost.

110
00:07:43,505 --> 00:07:45,361
Someone whose birthday
it was today.

111
00:07:45,489 --> 00:07:46,322
Rachel!

112
00:07:46,481 --> 00:07:47,569
That's right.

113
00:07:48,369 --> 00:07:50,354
I looked and I looked...

114
00:07:52,242 --> 00:07:53,970
It was very sad.

115
00:07:55,857 --> 00:07:58,801
But then, I felt something.

116
00:07:59,922 --> 00:08:01,170
A special kind of feeling

117
00:08:01,521 --> 00:08:03,601
that leads you
to a specific direction.

118
00:08:07,632 --> 00:08:09,522
And then, I found it!

119
00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:12,690
A red Mustang.

120
00:08:15,504 --> 00:08:18,833
And I tried to pet it
but it wouldn't let me.

121
00:08:18,961 --> 00:08:21,330
But I had a strong feeling that

122
00:08:21,681 --> 00:08:24,146
this horse
would lead me to Rachel.

123
00:08:25,168 --> 00:08:30,738
I felt the spirit from the tips
of my toes go up my leg,

124
00:08:31,472 --> 00:08:34,769
go out of my kneecaps,
up up to my skull,

125
00:08:35,121 --> 00:08:37,201
and back through my hair.

126
00:08:38,353 --> 00:08:41,425
And you all know
where that lead me, right?

127
00:08:51,472 --> 00:08:53,009
<i>I felt something...</i>

128
00:08:53,361 --> 00:08:55,250

What are you doing?

150
00:12:47,312 --> 00:12:48,625
Where is it?

151
00:12:49,617 --> 00:12:51,601
Where is it? Give me it!

152
00:12:53,584 --> 00:12:54,736
Where did you put it?

153
00:12:58,129 --> 00:12:59,474
- Give me it!
- No it's mine.

154
00:12:59,633 --> 00:13:01,585
Stop it!
You're gonna get us in trouble.

155
00:13:01,969 --> 00:13:03,250
- No!
- Stop it!

156
00:13:05,553 --> 00:13:07,665
Stop it! Give me it.

157
00:13:07,952 --> 00:13:09,169
What's going on in here?

158
00:13:16,976 --> 00:13:18,001
Let's go.

159
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:24,144
Did anything happen
that you didn't want to happen?

160
00:13:25,009 --> 00:13:27,121
Did Mr. Will do anything to you?

161
00:13:27,248 --> 00:13:28,496
What? No!

162
00:13:30,064 --> 00:13:31,249
He didn't.

163
00:13:32,017 --> 00:13:33,970
Are you being honest with me?

164
00:13:34,672 --> 00:13:36,624
He didn't do anything.

165
00:13:42,609 --> 00:13:49,361
<i>(Opening cassette player.)</i>

166
00:13:50,001 --> 00:13:51,250
Hello.

167
00:13:52,464 --> 00:13:54,833
Hello, hello, hello.

168
00:13:56,176 --> 00:13:57,169
Hello?

<i>Hello?</i>

172
00:14:10,577 --> 00:14:11,697
It works!

173
00:14:15,089 --> 00:14:17,522
<i>This is Rachel Angela McKnight.</i>

174
00:14:18,256 --> 00:14:21,649
<i>Born May 8th 1996.</i>

175
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:23,890
<i>15 years old.</i>

176
00:14:24,945 --> 00:14:28,561
<i>A few weeks ago,
I experienced a miracle.</i>

177
00:14:30,737 --> 00:14:33,233
<i>An angelic voice came onto me,</i>

178
00:14:33,905 --> 00:14:35,633
<i>and when I heard it,</i>

179
00:14:35,793 --> 00:14:37,330
<i>I was troubled.</i>

180
00:14:45,296 --> 00:14:49,521
And the angel said unto her:
"Fear not, Mary,

181
00:14:49,808 --> 00:14:52,850
"for thou has found favor
in the Lord.

182
00:14:53,648 --> 00:14:57,234
"Behold, thou shall conceive
in thy womb

183
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:59,218
and bring forth a son.

184
00:14:59,568 --> 00:15:01,104
"And His name shall be..."

185
00:15:01,264 --> 00:15:02,224
<i>Jesus.</i>

186
00:15:04,208 --> 00:15:06,960
<i>Then said Mary unto the angel:</i>

187
00:15:07,217 --> 00:15:10,994
<i>"How shall this be,
seeing I know not a man?"</i>

188
00:15:13,936 --> 00:15:15,856
<i>And the angel answered:</i>

189
00:15:16,592 --> 00:15:19,408
<i>"The Holy Ghost
shall come upon thee</i>

190
00:15:19,569 --> 00:15:23,154
<i>"and the power of the highest
shall overshadow thee.</i>

191
00:15:24,304 --> 00:15:28,081
<i>"Therefore, that holy thing
which shall be born of thee</i>

192
00:15:28,241 --> 00:15:31,090
<i>"shall be called
the Son of God."</i>

193
00:15:33,969 --> 00:15:37,522
<i>The only voice I heard
was from a song on a tape.</i>

194
00:15:38,897 --> 00:15:41,362
<i>Could it be that
He did this to me?</i>

195
00:15:42,481 --> 00:15:45,361
<i>This wonderful blessing
of heavenly life.</i>

196
00:15:48,497 --> 00:15:51,922
<i>The voice that sang those words
of wonder and spirit...</i>

197
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:55,728
<i>"Don't leave me hanging
on the telephone"</i>

198
00:15:56,304 --> 00:15:57,296
Hey.

199
00:15:59,024 --> 00:16:02,769
Is He the one who filled me
with this Jesus baby?

200
00:16:04,688 --> 00:16:05,905
Amen.

201
00:16:43,249 --> 00:16:45,361
Tell Rachel to come
meet me here, OK?

202
00:16:45,712 --> 00:16:46,801
Yes, ma'am.

203
00:16:48,848 --> 00:16:53,776
<i>Don't leave me
hanging on the telephone</i>

204
00:16:56,400 --> 00:17:00,625
<i>Don't leave me
hanging on the telephone</i>

205
00:17:02,608 --> 00:17:05,234
Are you storing up
for an apocalypse?

206
00:17:06,385 --> 00:17:07,281
I just...

207
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:09,938
I haven't gotten it for a while.

208
00:17:10,096 --> 00:17:11,824
How much of a while?

209
00:17:13,617 --> 00:17:15,537
- Months.
- It's normal.

210
00:17:15,857 --> 00:17:17,906
It comes and goes at your age.

211
00:17:22,577 --> 00:17:24,721
You know how, sometimes...

212
00:17:25,136 --> 00:17:26,866
When you don't get it
for a while,

213
00:17:27,025 --> 00:17:28,305
it means you're pregnant?

214
00:17:31,217 --> 00:17:32,849
I think that's what it is.

215
00:17:38,192 --> 00:17:41,649
I'm so relieved,
I thought you would be mad.

216
00:17:45,873 --> 00:17:47,600
A few months ago...

217
00:17:48,207 --> 00:17:51,377
When I was in the cellar,
I found that blue tape

218
00:17:51,665 --> 00:17:54,000
and something happened,
I think...

219
00:17:54,385 --> 00:17:57,841
I think God got me pregnant
through that blue tape.

220
00:18:01,169 --> 00:18:02,801
Go get in the truck.

221
00:18:16,144 --> 00:18:17,521
I need the keys.

222
00:18:18,384 --> 00:18:19,920
Is everything alright?

223
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:21,713
Women troubles.

224
00:18:34,704 --> 00:18:37,394
- Mom, I really want to explain.
- No, this is all my fault.

225
00:18:37,552 --> 00:18:38,545
I shouldn't have been filling
your head up

226
00:18:38,673 --> 00:18:40,336
with all those stories.

227
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,176
- No!
- Let's not discuss it anymore.

228
00:18:44,976 --> 00:18:46,801
Until we know for sure.

229
00:19:32,143 --> 00:19:33,840
It's been ten minutes.

230
00:19:34,289 --> 00:19:35,633
Alright.

231
00:19:43,472 --> 00:19:44,498
It's a miracle!

232
00:19:52,464 --> 00:19:55,888
<i>The role of a mother
is a large one to take on.</i>

233
00:19:56,817 --> 00:19:57,905
<i>In my case,</i>

234
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:00,210
<i>it wasn't a choice.</i>

235
00:20:01,233 --> 00:20:02,513
<i>I heard Mom say that</i>

236
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:04,688
<i>she was surprised every time.</i>

237
00:20:06,863 --> 00:20:09,554
<i>But I'm convinced
that the role of a mother</i>

238
00:20:09,712 --> 00:20:13,072
<i>cannot be fulfilled
without a father.</i>

239
00:20:16,081 --> 00:20:19,312
<i>The truth is the man
on the tape recorder did this.</i>

240
00:20:20,048 --> 00:20:21,616
<i>God's vessel,</i>

241
00:20:22,224 --> 00:20:23,761
<i>the tape deck.</i>

242
00:20:29,073 --> 00:20:31,569
Let us start with a prayer,
Rachel.

243
00:20:31,953 --> 00:20:33,233
Will you lead it?

244
00:20:38,673 --> 00:20:40,497
Dear Heavenly Father,

245
00:20:40,911 --> 00:20:43,057
we are thankful
for this opportunity

246
00:20:43,216 --> 00:20:44,176
for a last-minute interview

247
00:20:44,336 --> 00:20:47,633
to understand
Thy mysterious ways.

248
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:50,000
We are thankful for

249
00:20:50,511 --> 00:20:52,401
tape recorders and...

250
00:20:52,561 --> 00:20:54,001
and telephones.

251
00:20:54,737 --> 00:20:57,713
Please,
please give us a good feeling

252
00:20:57,873 --> 00:21:01,457
and a spirit of understanding
in the name of Jesus Christ...

253
00:21:01,648 --> 00:21:02,449
Amen.

254
00:21:02,672 --> 00:21:04,368
- Amen.
- Amen.

255
00:21:10,927 --> 00:21:12,657
Rachel, it has come
to my attention

256
00:21:12,816 --> 00:21:14,769
that you are with child.

257
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:16,944
Is that true?

258
00:21:20,431 --> 00:21:24,082
Well then,
I have contacted Ben Brooksby.

259
00:21:24,719 --> 00:21:25,906
His son, Elijah Brooksby,

260
00:21:26,801 --> 00:21:28,081
has agreed to marry you
tomorrow night.

261
00:21:28,207 --> 00:21:28,912
What?

262
00:21:29,616 --> 00:21:31,248
Rachel, whoever did this to you

263
00:21:31,408 --> 00:21:34,160
is obviously unfit to be
the father of your child.

264
00:21:34,319 --> 00:21:34,960
Untrue.

265
00:21:35,313 --> 00:21:36,593
Rachel, you have committed sin.

266
00:21:36,752 --> 00:21:37,841
I didn't sin.

267
00:21:39,601 --> 00:21:43,281
Maybe, I listened to something
that I wasn't supposed to.

268
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:44,400
And then...

269
00:21:44,879 --> 00:21:46,066
Then I'm pregnant.

270
00:21:49,136 --> 00:21:50,897
A few months ago,

271
00:21:51,343 --> 00:21:56,081
I found a tape in the cellar
with music on it

272
00:21:56,239 --> 00:21:57,872
and I could feel the spirit

273
00:21:58,032 --> 00:21:59,792
from the tip of my toes
up through my head.

274
00:21:59,952 --> 00:22:02,130
Dad, it was just like Mary,
like in your lesson!

275
00:22:03,055 --> 00:22:05,904
I found Rachel and Mr. Will
with the tape

276
00:22:06,032 --> 00:22:07,857
engaged in activities.

277
00:22:13,302 --> 00:22:14,198
Rachel, will you stand up

278
00:22:15,095 --> 00:22:17,175
and Mr. Will,
will you sit down, please?

279
00:22:27,478 --> 00:22:30,103
Mr. Will,
did you get Rachel pregnant?

280
00:22:30,293 --> 00:22:31,190
- No.
- He didn't.

281
00:22:32,085 --> 00:22:33,494
We are not speaking to you now,
Rachel,

282
00:22:33,653 --> 00:22:36,022
we're speaking with Mr. Will.

283
00:22:36,182 --> 00:22:37,847
I did not do it.

284
00:22:40,279 --> 00:22:41,943
You leave me with no choice.

285
00:22:44,086 --> 00:22:46,391
Tomorrow, Mr. Will,
you will leave this family

286
00:22:46,551 --> 00:22:49,239
and Rachel,
you will marry Elijah Brooksby.

287
00:22:49,398 --> 00:22:51,096
Mom, you know
we didn't do anything.

288
00:22:51,254 --> 00:22:51,831
To bed.

289
00:23:09,494 --> 00:23:11,031
<i>Elijah Brooksby?</i>

290
00:23:11,734 --> 00:23:14,262
<i>Marriage to Elijah Brooksby?</i>

291
00:23:16,310 --> 00:23:19,990
<i>I don't even have to ask God
to know that's not right.</i>

292
00:23:24,790 --> 00:23:25,815
<i>It's a horse...</i>

293
00:25:03,253 --> 00:25:07,862
<i>(Baby crying.)</i>

294
00:25:24,247 --> 00:25:25,751
<i>Your big toes,</i>

295
00:25:25,910 --> 00:25:27,958
<i>big as my big nose...</i>

296
00:25:29,302 --> 00:25:31,542
<i>So the story goes...</i>

297
00:25:32,917 --> 00:25:34,742
<i>Settle down...</i>

298
00:25:38,421 --> 00:25:39,606
Halleluyah.

299
00:26:21,846 --> 00:26:22,934
Mom, wake up!

300
00:26:23,862 --> 00:26:24,951
- Mom!
- Stop!

301
00:26:30,486 --> 00:26:31,446
Rachel!

302
00:26:31,574 --> 00:26:33,142
Now, Rachel, stop right there!

303
00:26:33,301 --> 00:26:34,774
Rachel, come back!

304
00:26:35,349 --> 00:26:38,166
Alright, come on now honey,
open the truck.

305
00:26:38,325 --> 00:26:40,918
No, do not...
You are not doing that.

306
00:26:41,078 --> 00:26:43,031
Pull right over right now,
Rachel!

307
00:26:45,142 --> 00:26:47,478
<i>Good evening friends and family,</i>

308
00:26:52,565 --> 00:26:54,614
<i>I accelerate down the road</i>

309
00:26:55,157 --> 00:26:57,109
<i>I have not yet traversed.</i>

310
00:27:02,742 --> 00:27:04,662
<i>I travel beyond the red bluffs</i>

311
00:27:04,790 --> 00:27:08,503
<i>of a home I can not again
call my home...</i>

312
00:27:12,598 --> 00:27:16,183
<i>In search of the father

313
00:27:16,822 --> 00:27:19,351
<i>the man who sings

314
00:27:42,165 --> 00:27:43,350

<i>In Him was life.</i>

<i>but came to bear witness

335
00:29:43,061 --> 00:29:45,238
I'm looking for a guy
who plays the guitar.

336
00:29:45,365 --> 00:29:47,350
Maybe a little bit younger
than yourself.

337
00:29:48,309 --> 00:29:49,302
Alright.

338
00:29:50,420 --> 00:29:53,111
There's a venue down there
where the kids go for music.

339
00:29:53,749 --> 00:29:54,838
Alright?

340
00:30:02,453 --> 00:30:03,478
Hello, sir.

341
00:30:03,605 --> 00:30:05,495
Wow, this is the first time

342
00:30:05,653 --> 00:30:08,405
I've ever met
anyone like you before.

343
00:30:09,141 --> 00:30:11,093
However, can I go inside?

344
00:30:11,414 --> 00:30:12,919
You gotta be 18.

345
00:30:13,781 --> 00:30:16,022
Sir, I've never been
inside of a beauty bar before.

346
00:30:16,213 --> 00:30:17,526
Stay the fuck out!

347
00:30:18,101 --> 00:30:19,799
I deserved that.

348
00:30:23,382 --> 00:30:24,855
That's my girlfriend.

349
00:30:26,453 --> 00:30:28,151
Where the fuck have you been?

350
00:30:28,310 --> 00:30:30,134
Thanks for letting us play, man.

351
00:30:31,286 --> 00:30:33,174
Wait, so we can't stay
for the other band?

352
00:30:34,197 --> 00:30:34,550
What the fuck?

353
00:30:35,606 --> 00:30:36,054
We have every right
to listen to the other bands.

354
00:30:36,790 --> 00:30:38,230
Can you even hear
the other bands?

355
00:30:46,934 --> 00:30:47,959
Alright.

356
00:30:48,790 --> 00:30:49,782
Next time.

357
00:30:51,382 --> 00:30:53,014
Hey, Cheese is here.

358
00:30:55,477 --> 00:30:56,982
Where are you guys heading to?

359
00:30:57,974 --> 00:30:58,838
Do you wanna come?

360
00:30:59,989 --> 00:31:01,878
John,
she wants to have my babies.

361
00:31:02,037 --> 00:31:02,646
She wants to what?

362
00:31:03,478 --> 00:31:04,311
Yeah,
they'll only be a little deaf.

363
00:31:05,429 --> 00:31:07,798
- Just a little bit deaf.
- I think those are good odds.

364
00:31:09,398 --> 00:31:10,806
Are you
some sort of prairie girl?

365
00:31:10,965 --> 00:31:12,855
Oi, let's shag ass already!

366
00:31:13,366 --> 00:31:16,087
Actually,
I just lost some of my hearing,

367
00:31:16,245 --> 00:31:17,494
it's pretty sexy though, right?

368
00:31:18,165 --> 00:31:19,509
Not into it?

369
00:31:24,404 --> 00:31:25,878
Is it OK if I go with you?

370
00:31:27,892 --> 00:31:28,822
Sure.

371
00:31:29,653 --> 00:31:32,597
But is the prairie guy
coming with you?

372
00:31:32,917 --> 00:31:34,935
- Let's go.
- What are you doing here?

373
00:31:35,062 --> 00:31:36,822
We're going home
and you're confessing to Dad.

374
00:31:38,517 --> 00:31:40,758
Just take the truck keys
and leave.

375
00:31:41,110 --> 00:31:42,167
Rachel,
in case you don't remember

376
00:31:42,325 --> 00:31:44,438
I got kicked out
because you sinned.

377
00:31:44,598 --> 00:31:45,302
I have a rifle behind my bed,

378
00:31:46,166 --> 00:31:47,767
you guys can solve
that little quarrel

379
00:31:47,926 --> 00:31:49,047
back at my place.

380
00:31:49,205 --> 00:31:51,125
Just take the truck keys
and leave.

381
00:31:51,285 --> 00:31:53,783
I'm not leaving
without a confession.

382
00:31:55,958 --> 00:31:58,358
- Get the fuck out man.
- Oh, shit!

383
00:31:58,517 --> 00:32:00,342
Are you really gonna stick
with the virgin Mary thing?

384
00:32:00,501 --> 00:32:02,518
I told you I wasn't going
to let you drive.

385
00:32:04,309 --> 00:32:05,269
Are they coming?
What are we doing?

386
00:32:05,430 --> 00:32:06,294
Close the fucking door.

387
00:32:07,382 --> 00:32:10,070
Piece of shit! That was close.

388
00:32:14,742 --> 00:32:16,311
You are... all alright.

389
00:32:30,773 --> 00:32:33,077
I wanted to make sure
you were real.

390
00:32:41,621 --> 00:32:44,533
You fuckers
rigged my wheel again? God!

391
00:32:47,702 --> 00:32:49,590
That's right, fuckers...

392
00:32:50,869 --> 00:32:52,309
Say it!

393
00:32:54,773 --> 00:32:56,278
We don't swear.

394
00:32:58,614 --> 00:32:59,830
Alright.

395
00:33:00,758 --> 00:33:02,742
I'll bet you'll be swearing
sooner or later.

396
00:33:36,597 --> 00:33:38,261
Do you promise you'll confess?

397
00:33:38,390 --> 00:33:40,054
I told you the truth, Mr. Will.

398
00:34:56,372 --> 00:34:57,143
Vain.

399
00:34:59,157 --> 00:35:01,239
Do you think I'm pretty?

400
00:35:02,902 --> 00:35:05,141
Here it is. You like it?

401
00:35:08,501 --> 00:35:09,462
Sit down.

402
00:35:11,957 --> 00:35:13,429
Sit down.

403
00:35:16,629 --> 00:35:18,071
I didn't catch your name.

404
00:35:19,286 --> 00:35:20,439
Mr. Will.

405
00:35:20,981 --> 00:35:22,230
Mr. Will?

406
00:35:23,509 --> 00:35:26,261
Hello Mr. Will, I'm Mr. Clyde.

407
00:35:27,126 --> 00:35:29,270
You just call me Clyde.

408
00:35:31,124 --> 00:35:32,437
Or Master.

409
00:35:32,757 --> 00:35:34,774
You know what,
you call me Master.

410
00:35:35,541 --> 00:35:36,789
I won't shoot, I promise.

411
00:35:37,653 --> 00:35:38,422
Hi!

412
00:35:39,158 --> 00:35:40,278
Clyde, put the gun away!

413
00:35:45,654 --> 00:35:48,183
Hi cutie,
can you watch her for me?

414
00:35:49,909 --> 00:35:51,253
Oh my god!

415
00:35:51,669 --> 00:35:53,109
Are you from the prairie?

416
00:35:53,621 --> 00:35:55,542
No, I'm from Utah.

417
00:35:55,989 --> 00:35:57,335
Where's that?

418
00:35:57,652 --> 00:35:59,925
Alright,
let's get out of this hellhole.

419
00:36:02,390 --> 00:36:03,734
You guys wanna play?

420
00:36:04,436 --> 00:36:05,367
Hey!

421
00:36:06,134 --> 00:36:06,998
Hey.

422
00:36:08,054 --> 00:36:10,007
When do you guys play?
I really like rock 'n roll.

423
00:36:10,614 --> 00:36:12,438
We're kind of hiatusing
right now.

424
00:36:12,821 --> 00:36:14,902
Whatever,
are you guys playing tomorrow?

425
00:36:15,700 --> 00:36:16,534
Oh yeah.

426
00:36:17,589 --> 00:36:19,189
You guys can come if you want.

427
00:36:19,573 --> 00:36:20,501
Later.

428
00:36:21,013 --> 00:36:21,878
Later, man.

429
00:36:26,260 --> 00:36:27,605
Hold up your fingers.

430
00:36:28,309 --> 00:36:30,422
How it works, is it's called
"Never have I ever"...

431
00:36:30,581 --> 00:36:32,310
So you would say for example

432
00:36:32,469 --> 00:36:34,326
"Never have I ever
been to jail."

433
00:36:35,990 --> 00:36:38,615
And he puts one down
because he's been to jail.

434
00:36:39,285 --> 00:36:41,109
What happened?

435
00:36:41,780 --> 00:36:44,693
I shot my mom's dog
and she pressed charges.

436
00:36:45,460 --> 00:36:47,733
They kicked me out,
but it's cool.

437
00:36:48,374 --> 00:36:50,613
- That's terrible.
- Alright...

438
00:36:51,510 --> 00:36:53,334
If you're gonna play
that shit...

439
00:36:53,492 --> 00:36:55,669
"Never have I ever"
had a period.

440
00:36:56,021 --> 00:36:57,815
- Clyde...
- That's so stupid.

441
00:36:57,973 --> 00:36:59,157
So stupid.

442
00:36:59,317 --> 00:37:00,278
Estúpido.

443
00:37:00,501 --> 00:37:02,869
OK, my turn.

444
00:37:04,278 --> 00:37:07,030
"Never have I ever"
had a hamburger.

445
00:37:07,510 --> 00:37:09,813
Oh man, you're gonna kill us
at this game.

446
00:37:10,581 --> 00:37:13,461
I wanna try one,
I'm actually pretty hungry.

447
00:37:13,622 --> 00:37:16,726
"Never have I ever"
been to Mexico.

448
00:37:17,621 --> 00:37:19,669
"Never have I ever"
been pregnant.

449
00:37:20,181 --> 00:37:23,062
Clyde, stop doing
gender-specific ones.

450
00:37:26,836 --> 00:37:28,213
Are you pregnant?

451
00:37:28,598 --> 00:37:29,782
She's pregnant.

452
00:37:32,726 --> 00:37:35,637
Yeah, I'm sort of pregnant...

453
00:37:36,725 --> 00:37:39,509
I'm looking for the dad,
so it's fine.

454
00:37:41,366 --> 00:37:44,149
I didn't actually
do anything wrong.

455
00:37:44,662 --> 00:37:46,550
So you're a pure slut?

456
00:37:47,156 --> 00:37:48,277
Don't be a dick!

457
00:37:48,501 --> 00:37:49,751
Don't listen to him.

458
00:37:50,166 --> 00:37:50,998
OK.

459
00:37:53,109 --> 00:37:56,406
"Never have I ever"
spoken on a cellular phone.

460
00:37:56,948 --> 00:37:58,486
I got one. Where's my phone?

461
00:37:59,701 --> 00:38:01,653
Didn't you say
you were pregnant?

462
00:38:01,813 --> 00:38:05,015
All girls are pregnant.
We're all pregnant.

463
00:38:05,140 --> 00:38:07,093
What does that even mean?
Here.

464
00:38:08,245 --> 00:38:10,453
- Hold it to your ear.
- OK.

465
00:38:11,030 --> 00:38:12,439
Call her.
You call her.

466
00:38:14,166 --> 00:38:15,126
You call her.

467
00:38:19,062 --> 00:38:19,894
Hello?

468
00:38:23,765 --> 00:38:25,909
This is Rachel. Can you hear me?

469
00:38:26,260 --> 00:38:28,181
Check the microphone, testing.

470
00:38:28,309 --> 00:38:29,974
One, two, three. Hello?

471
00:38:30,197 --> 00:38:32,021
Testing, testing,
one, two, three.

472
00:38:32,150 --> 00:38:33,270
Can you hear me?

473
00:38:34,292 --> 00:38:35,957
<i>Don't leave me
hanging on the telephone</i>

474
00:38:36,116 --> 00:38:37,301
Oh, I like that one.

475
00:38:38,388 --> 00:38:39,638
<i>Don't leave me
hanging on the telephone.</i>

476
00:38:41,269 --> 00:38:42,742
It's beeping!

477
00:38:42,901 --> 00:38:44,597
Press the green button. Green.

478
00:38:45,013 --> 00:38:46,422
Press play.

479
00:38:48,340 --> 00:38:49,237
<i>Hey.</i>

480
00:38:50,134 --> 00:38:52,437
- Hey.
- <i>You wanna get loaded later?</i>

481
00:38:53,653 --> 00:38:54,390
Yes.

482
00:38:55,349 --> 00:38:57,493
- Yeah. Loaded.
- <i>Come to my room then.</i>

483
00:38:59,478 --> 00:39:00,758
<i>Alright, lates.</i>

484
00:39:30,966 --> 00:39:32,375
Day One.

485
00:39:32,501 --> 00:39:36,215
Arrived in Electric Paradise:
Las Vegas.

486
00:39:37,589 --> 00:39:39,797
I met a group of people.

487
00:39:40,596 --> 00:39:42,037
Clyde and...

488
00:39:42,453 --> 00:39:44,022
and some other girls

489
00:39:44,180 --> 00:39:45,493
taking me in.

490
00:39:48,246 --> 00:39:49,814
Clyde is...

491
00:39:51,317 --> 00:39:53,174
perhaps the spawn

492
00:39:54,005 --> 00:39:55,414
of Satan.

493
00:39:56,757 --> 00:39:58,294
Then there's Johnny.

494
00:40:16,694 --> 00:40:17,557
Hello.

495
00:40:19,926 --> 00:40:20,757
Hey.

496
00:40:23,445 --> 00:40:25,302
You want something to drink?

497
00:40:25,877 --> 00:40:26,646
No, thanks.

498
00:40:27,605 --> 00:40:29,974
Cool, there's pizza,
if you want some.

499
00:40:30,325 --> 00:40:31,189
Thanks.

500
00:40:31,381 --> 00:40:32,854
I mean, cool.

501
00:40:54,486 --> 00:40:56,342
Would you ever want to marry me?

502
00:41:00,245 --> 00:41:01,045
What was that?

503
00:41:07,125 --> 00:41:09,334
Would you ever wanna...

504
00:41:09,749 --> 00:41:11,701
go out some time...

505
00:41:12,021 --> 00:41:15,734
and show me the city
or something cool.

506
00:41:16,597 --> 00:41:18,262
That's what you guys say, right?

507
00:41:18,421 --> 00:41:19,414
"Cool."

508
00:41:22,101 --> 00:41:24,086
Just... Just...

509
00:41:24,436 --> 00:41:26,133
Let me know when...

510
00:41:27,093 --> 00:41:28,085
I mean...

511
00:41:30,901 --> 00:41:31,734
Sure.

512
00:41:39,158 --> 00:41:40,726
You wanna borrow some clothes?

513
00:41:41,748 --> 00:41:42,997
No, no thanks.

514
00:41:43,317 --> 00:41:44,885
You look crazy.

515
00:41:47,316 --> 00:41:48,470
Thank you.

516
00:41:49,076 --> 00:41:50,166
Put these on at least.

517
00:41:50,324 --> 00:41:53,013
You'll get wrinkles
if you squint that hard.

518
00:41:53,204 --> 00:41:54,709
I accept.

519
00:41:58,388 --> 00:41:59,669
You look ridiculous.

520
00:41:59,829 --> 00:42:01,206
Thank you.

521
00:42:01,877 --> 00:42:04,245
- Are you ready?
- For what?

522
00:42:04,565 --> 00:42:05,557
I'm leaving.

523
00:42:05,716 --> 00:42:07,381
I need your confession.

524
00:42:09,237 --> 00:42:11,926
You guys planting gardens today
or are you coming?

525
00:42:12,117 --> 00:42:14,198
- She's not going.
- Yes, I am.

526
00:42:17,749 --> 00:42:19,413
If I were you, man,

527
00:42:20,052 --> 00:42:22,421
I would watch
this girl's every move.

528
00:42:22,548 --> 00:42:23,957
Girls like this

529
00:42:24,308 --> 00:42:25,558
can't be trusted.

530
00:42:26,293 --> 00:42:28,053
I'll come back, I promise.

531
00:43:33,909 --> 00:43:35,350
How's everyone feeling tonight?

532
00:43:46,325 --> 00:43:48,693
Alright,
this song is called "Zombie."

533
00:44:40,821 --> 00:44:42,902
I have to pee so much.

534
00:44:51,572 --> 00:44:53,653
Perhaps over time...

535
00:44:54,357 --> 00:44:57,941
music, styles of music changed.

536
00:44:59,060 --> 00:45:00,789
I'm not quite sure if

537
00:45:00,948 --> 00:45:03,221
what Johnny plays
is actually music.

538
00:45:05,332 --> 00:45:07,445
Hi, I'm Kevin.

539
00:47:00,212 --> 00:47:02,709
I'm ready to give you
a confession.

540
00:47:03,701 --> 00:47:05,045
I want you to leave.

541
00:47:08,597 --> 00:47:10,070
Isn't that what you want?

542
00:47:12,628 --> 00:47:15,638
I'll make up anything.
Just tell me what you want!

543
00:47:17,556 --> 00:47:21,268
I want the truth, recorded over
the contents of the blue tape.

544
00:47:21,429 --> 00:47:22,485
Tonight.

545
00:47:25,363 --> 00:47:26,742
I don't know, man.

546
00:47:27,028 --> 00:47:28,533
I could try forever.

547
00:47:30,580 --> 00:47:32,149
- Sorry, man.
- Pardon me.

548
00:47:40,371 --> 00:47:41,684
Good show.

549
00:47:42,517 --> 00:47:43,445
Thanks.

550
00:47:45,460 --> 00:47:49,078
Can we talk about your music?
It's urgent.

551
00:47:49,397 --> 00:47:52,788
Well, you know it's not satanic
or anything.

552
00:47:53,013 --> 00:47:54,134
I sing about important stuff,

553
00:47:54,293 --> 00:47:57,014
like political stuff,
comic stuff, etc.

554
00:47:58,420 --> 00:47:59,893
Well, cool.

555
00:48:00,852 --> 00:48:02,548
Can we talk over there?

556
00:48:02,933 --> 00:48:05,014
What do you wanna talk about?

557
00:48:06,356 --> 00:48:08,213
Something music related.

558
00:48:10,836 --> 00:48:11,862
Yeah, sure.

559
00:48:18,709 --> 00:48:20,917
I was really into it because...

560
00:48:21,716 --> 00:48:24,277
my older brother
was into like...

561
00:48:24,436 --> 00:48:26,741
Fugazi and shit like that.

562
00:48:27,733 --> 00:48:29,237
- Oh yeah?
- Yeah.

563
00:48:34,581 --> 00:48:35,510
If you have
your left foot forward,

564
00:48:35,861 --> 00:48:36,244
it's regular.

565
00:48:36,916 --> 00:48:38,325
The other way round is goofy.

566
00:48:38,676 --> 00:48:39,797
Are you regular or goofy?

567
00:48:40,372 --> 00:48:41,237
What's that?

568
00:48:42,549 --> 00:48:44,054
Are you regular or goofy?

569
00:48:44,180 --> 00:48:45,077
Goofy.

570
00:48:45,845 --> 00:48:46,773
You're probably regular.

571
00:48:49,556 --> 00:48:50,805
So you're Rachel's brother?

572
00:48:51,156 --> 00:48:52,372
Not intentionally.

573
00:48:52,565 --> 00:48:54,006
Why are you guys running?

574
00:48:54,164 --> 00:48:56,853
She got pregnant and
my dad has arranged a marriage.

575
00:48:57,268 --> 00:48:58,518
She got down with her boyfriend.

576
00:48:59,028 --> 00:48:59,956
She doesn't have a boyfriend.

577
00:49:02,708 --> 00:49:03,829
You have a crush on her?

578
00:49:04,213 --> 00:49:05,174
What's a crush?

579
00:49:05,300 --> 00:49:07,541
- Did you fuck your sister?
- No!

580
00:49:08,501 --> 00:49:09,717
Well, who did?

581
00:49:10,003 --> 00:49:11,797
Don't know. She won't say.

582
00:49:13,685 --> 00:49:16,406
Sounds like a potiental
"Lifetime for Women" film.

583
00:49:18,581 --> 00:49:19,541
You got a guess?

584
00:49:20,148 --> 00:49:20,885
No.

585
00:49:21,332 --> 00:49:21,876
None.

586
00:49:22,869 --> 00:49:24,182
Did your dad do it?

587
00:49:24,915 --> 00:49:27,574
- Did your dad fuck your sister?
- Shut up!

588
00:49:27,765 --> 00:49:29,078
She wants a husband now

589
00:49:29,236 --> 00:49:31,158
or a boyfriend
to take care of her?

590
00:49:31,988 --> 00:49:32,789
Yeah.

591
00:49:35,444 --> 00:49:36,469
Yeah, and...

592
00:49:37,395 --> 00:49:40,564
I just learned power chords
and that was it.

593
00:49:41,268 --> 00:49:42,644
Oh yeah, yeah.

594
00:49:44,468 --> 00:49:46,836
Did you ever play
a song about the telephone?

595
00:49:49,204 --> 00:49:50,773
Definitely Nintendo

596
00:49:50,931 --> 00:49:52,660
and Wolfenstein.

597
00:49:54,132 --> 00:49:55,924
Maybe telephones.

598
00:49:57,396 --> 00:49:59,860
'Cause I'm looking for
someone that...

599
00:50:00,725 --> 00:50:03,093
sings a song
about the telephone.

600
00:50:03,572 --> 00:50:04,564
And...

601
00:50:40,851 --> 00:50:42,454
Dude, are you alright?

602
00:50:50,773 --> 00:50:53,109
I don't see him.
Is he down there?

603
00:50:53,364 --> 00:50:53,684
That sucks.

604
00:50:54,645 --> 00:50:56,020
What happened?
I thought you were watching him.

605
00:50:56,181 --> 00:50:57,558
I'm not his fucking babysitter.

606
00:50:58,069 --> 00:51:00,117
Let's get the fuck out of here.

607
00:51:00,852 --> 00:51:02,868
One, two, three...

608
00:51:23,348 --> 00:51:24,085
I'm not taking them.

609
00:51:25,172 --> 00:51:26,133
Please Mr. Will, just take them.
Don't be such a martyr.

610
00:51:26,964 --> 00:51:28,597
I'm not like you!
I don't take drugs!

611
00:51:29,236 --> 00:51:30,676
Swallow, swallow.

612
00:51:51,092 --> 00:51:53,173
Gonna try
and reset your arm okay?

613
00:52:05,672 --> 00:52:07,914
Have you guys noticed
the beautiful women out here?

614
00:52:09,993 --> 00:52:13,098
There are no sweet spirits
like there are at home.

615
00:52:15,049 --> 00:52:16,650
That's what we call
the ugly girls.

616
00:52:16,809 --> 00:52:18,123
- Oh yeah?
- Yeah!

617
00:52:18,665 --> 00:52:19,850
Is he OK?

618
00:52:20,105 --> 00:52:21,641
The drugs are working.

619
00:52:22,986 --> 00:52:25,609
Dad would have such a fit
if he saw me like this.

620
00:52:25,769 --> 00:52:27,722
I'd be kicked out
of the colony for sure.

621
00:52:28,201 --> 00:52:29,899
You are out of the colony.

622
00:52:30,057 --> 00:52:31,465
Well, no!

623
00:52:32,074 --> 00:52:33,483
I'm going back tomorrow.

624
00:52:34,154 --> 00:52:35,818
You will tell me
who you've sexed!

625
00:52:36,393 --> 00:52:37,289
Yeah!

626
00:52:43,561 --> 00:52:45,321
Are you guys speaking Japanese?

627
00:52:47,530 --> 00:52:49,482
You guys are speaking Japanese.

628
00:53:06,826 --> 00:53:08,361
You know I don't like you,
right?

629
00:53:10,889 --> 00:53:12,298
Neither does Johnny.

630
00:53:12,553 --> 00:53:13,674
Why would you say that?

631
00:53:14,249 --> 00:53:15,594
You're knocked up.

632
00:53:16,457 --> 00:53:17,482
What?

633
00:53:18,024 --> 00:53:19,178
You're pregnant.

634
00:53:20,073 --> 00:53:21,098
You're...

635
00:53:21,929 --> 00:53:23,337
damaged goods.

636
00:53:25,322 --> 00:53:27,722
She's had
an immaculate conception.

637
00:53:28,873 --> 00:53:31,113
She's carrying the son of God.

638
00:53:31,594 --> 00:53:33,289
That little fucker.

639
00:53:35,561 --> 00:53:37,290
Told you he'd say "fucker."

640
00:53:47,913 --> 00:53:49,353
Can I show you something?

641
00:54:00,554 --> 00:54:03,466
<i>♪ I heard your mother,
now she's going out the door ♪</i>

642
00:54:03,626 --> 00:54:06,409
<i>♪ Did she go to work
or just go to the store? ♪</i>

643
00:54:06,537 --> 00:54:09,418
<i>♪ All those things she said,
I told you to ignore. ♪</i>

644
00:54:09,864 --> 00:54:12,233
<i>♪ Oh, why can't we talk again? ♪</i>

645
00:54:12,745 --> 00:54:15,242
<i>♪ Oh, why can't we talk again? ♪</i>

646
00:54:15,689 --> 00:54:18,122
<i>♪ Oh, why can't we talk again? ♪</i>
- Can you tell?

647
00:54:18,696 --> 00:54:20,394
<i>♪ Don't leave me hanging..." ♪</i>

648
00:54:20,553 --> 00:54:22,442
It's probably an older band.

649
00:54:28,233 --> 00:54:31,017
Johnny didn't sing this.

650
00:54:34,889 --> 00:54:37,001
You think this got you pregnant?

651
00:54:38,921 --> 00:54:40,170
With the son of God?

652
00:54:45,641 --> 00:54:46,378
Yes.

653
00:54:53,962 --> 00:54:56,906
(Sobbing.)

654
00:55:08,714 --> 00:55:09,866
Are you OK?

655
00:55:17,385 --> 00:55:18,602
We'll find the guy.

656
00:55:20,170 --> 00:55:21,834
If that's what you want.

657
00:55:25,033 --> 00:55:26,218
That's what you want, right?

658
00:55:27,242 --> 00:55:28,458
Crazy girl.

659
00:55:30,633 --> 00:55:31,913
You don't believe me.

660
00:55:34,601 --> 00:55:36,234
No, I don't believe you.

661
00:55:42,441 --> 00:55:44,106
Why don't you just...

662
00:55:46,408 --> 00:55:47,689
marry me?

663
00:55:50,920 --> 00:55:52,713
As a backup, you know?

664
00:55:53,609 --> 00:55:54,858
In case we don't find this guy.

665
00:55:57,673 --> 00:55:58,473
But...

666
00:55:59,178 --> 00:56:00,234
you're not the guy on the tape.

667
00:56:01,641 --> 00:56:02,570
Well...

668
00:56:03,401 --> 00:56:04,939
If we find him,

669
00:56:07,113 --> 00:56:08,233
you can leave me.

670
00:56:10,089 --> 00:56:11,274
You would do that?

671
00:56:14,216 --> 00:56:14,954
Yeah.

672
00:56:19,594 --> 00:56:20,362
OK.

673
00:56:21,321 --> 00:56:22,506
- OK?
- Yeah.

674
00:56:26,441 --> 00:56:27,433
We're married!

675
00:56:28,490 --> 00:56:29,226
Yeah?

676
00:56:30,154 --> 00:56:31,018
Just like that?

677
00:56:31,945 --> 00:56:32,554
Yeah.

678
00:56:37,321 --> 00:56:38,857
Do we say "I love you"?

679
00:56:43,593 --> 00:56:44,361
No.

680
00:56:47,465 --> 00:56:48,778
Maybe one day.

681
00:56:49,705 --> 00:56:51,081
Yeah, maybe.

682
00:56:59,466 --> 00:57:01,258
Don't tell Mr. Will...

683
00:57:02,153 --> 00:57:02,826
OK?

684
00:57:04,009 --> 00:57:04,649
OK.

685
00:57:11,721 --> 00:57:12,777
You know, I...

686
00:57:15,284 --> 00:57:16,564
I won't touch you...

687
00:57:17,106 --> 00:57:18,131
like that.

688
00:57:19,858 --> 00:57:21,075
If you don't want it.

689
00:57:31,026 --> 00:57:32,403
Thank you.

690
00:59:03,155 --> 00:59:04,308
She's hungry.

691
00:59:05,235 --> 00:59:06,227
She's gotta feed our baby.
Go feed her baby.

692
00:59:13,586 --> 00:59:15,891
Let's all skip, let's skip!
Come on, skip!

693
00:59:16,050 --> 00:59:17,875
Shut the fuck up.

694
00:59:23,091 --> 00:59:26,068
- We'll get you some food.
- Yeah, go get some food.

695
00:59:26,227 --> 00:59:28,020
- It's so big.
- We'll wait here.

696
00:59:28,372 --> 00:59:29,044
Are they going inside?

697
00:59:29,843 --> 00:59:32,499
- Let's hide!
- Why are we hiding?

698
00:59:32,659 --> 00:59:33,748
'Cause
we're not supposed to be here.

699
00:59:33,876 --> 00:59:35,475
We're not?

700
00:59:52,627 --> 00:59:53,716
Are they home?

701
00:59:54,675 --> 00:59:56,435
They're probably sleeping.

702
00:59:57,490 --> 00:59:59,571
Is it OK coming in like this?

703
01:00:00,339 --> 01:00:02,548
Yeah, as long as
they don't know, it's fine.

704
01:00:24,467 --> 01:00:25,940
Are these yours?

705
01:00:26,291 --> 01:00:27,027
No.

706
01:00:33,970 --> 01:00:36,179
I really don't think I should.

707
01:01:12,243 --> 01:01:13,299
Can we live here?

708
01:01:20,338 --> 01:01:21,107
No.

709
01:01:25,555 --> 01:01:27,124
We'll live by the sea.

710
01:01:30,994 --> 01:01:34,195
- Shall we go over the wall?
- I mean, I guess so.

711
01:01:34,739 --> 01:01:37,076
- It's really high!
- Wow, it is high.

712
01:01:37,202 --> 01:01:38,418
You do it. One... Ahh!

713
01:01:38,547 --> 01:01:39,987
Ahh! Ow!

714
01:01:41,938 --> 01:01:43,443
I can't do it.

715
01:01:47,859 --> 01:01:50,740
- We should go.
- Stay here, I'll be right back.

716
01:01:55,891 --> 01:01:57,267
Oh, wow...

717
01:03:42,130 --> 01:03:42,418
Hello, operator.

718
01:03:43,539 --> 01:03:46,611
I'd like to report an intruder
at 1533 Windhaven Circle.

719
01:03:46,771 --> 01:03:47,283
Yes.

720
01:03:47,762 --> 01:03:49,459
Yes, I will.

721
01:03:49,618 --> 01:03:51,379
I'm sorry.

722
01:03:56,274 --> 01:03:57,683
Young lady! Stop!

723
01:03:57,843 --> 01:03:59,316
Stop! Stop!

724
01:04:00,115 --> 01:04:01,236
- Dad!
- Stop!

725
01:04:02,099 --> 01:04:03,604
It's OK. Rachel, go!

726
01:04:04,083 --> 01:04:05,172
It's OK, they're OK.

727
01:04:05,875 --> 01:04:07,412
Go, go, go!

728
01:04:24,146 --> 01:04:25,075
Jesus.

729
01:04:27,635 --> 01:04:28,532
Watch your hand,
watch your hand.

730
01:04:28,883 --> 01:04:30,740
Turn around here, come on up.

731
01:04:31,026 --> 01:04:32,179
My shoes...

732
01:04:32,914 --> 01:04:34,098
Anything you say
can and will be used against you

733
01:04:34,227 --> 01:04:35,155
in a court of law.

734
01:04:35,635 --> 01:04:36,659
Get in there.

735
01:04:39,090 --> 01:04:41,971
<i>(Phone ringing.)</i>

736
01:04:54,899 --> 01:04:57,075
<i>Once upon a time, in a land,</i>

737
01:04:57,235 --> 01:04:59,092
<i>just on the other side of
the red bluffs...</i>

738
01:04:59,251 --> 01:05:00,082
<i>A red Mustang</i>

739
01:05:00,882 --> 01:05:02,642
<i>♪ Oh, I can't control myself ♪</i>

740
01:05:02,771 --> 01:05:05,491
<i>♪ Oh, I can't control myself ♪</i>

741
01:05:05,747 --> 01:05:10,548
<i>♪ Don't leave me

742
01:05:10,707 --> 01:05:13,971
<i>And you all know
where that lead me, right?</i>

743
01:05:28,723 --> 01:05:30,291
Is that girl pregnant?

744
01:05:31,955 --> 01:05:32,627
Yeah.

745
01:05:33,459 --> 01:05:34,483
You didn't get
that poor girl pregnant,

746
01:05:34,641 --> 01:05:35,251
did you?

747
01:05:38,290 --> 01:05:40,788
She had
an immaculate conception.

748
01:05:41,010 --> 01:05:42,132
I'm just...

749
01:05:42,321 --> 01:05:43,348
trying to help her out.

750
01:05:44,435 --> 01:05:46,548
Clyde, I just saved your ass
from going to jail again.

751
01:05:46,675 --> 01:05:47,795
Please don't give me that.

752
01:05:48,594 --> 01:05:49,938
Where have you been?

753
01:05:51,187 --> 01:05:51,988
Nowhere.

754
01:05:53,779 --> 01:05:55,699
Fine, you have to stay here.

755
01:05:56,275 --> 01:05:56,755
No.

756
01:05:57,714 --> 01:05:59,379
Well, it's either here
or it's juvenile hall.

757
01:06:00,209 --> 01:06:02,259
It's all the same to me, so...

758
01:06:09,394 --> 01:06:10,836
Face to your left.

759
01:06:26,643 --> 01:06:28,532
Do you have any form of ID?

760
01:06:32,099 --> 01:06:33,508
Driver's license?

761
01:06:34,531 --> 01:06:35,973
Social Security number?

762
01:06:37,860 --> 01:06:38,724
No.

763
01:07:10,627 --> 01:07:11,939
Can I help you?

764
01:07:12,386 --> 01:07:14,947
Yes, hi,
I'm Rachel Angela McKnight.

765
01:07:15,075 --> 01:07:16,739
- I'm 15...
- Hi.

766
01:07:18,351 --> 01:07:21,102
I was looking over there
at your vehicle and...

767
01:07:21,327 --> 01:07:23,408
I was just wondering if...

768
01:07:24,047 --> 01:07:25,520
Are you thirsty?

769
01:07:32,173 --> 01:07:33,391
<i>Is she cute?</i>

770
01:07:34,734 --> 01:07:36,848
<i>She's asking about your car,
I think she wants to buy it.</i>

771
01:07:36,973 --> 01:07:37,966
<i>Who is she?</i>

772
01:08:12,046 --> 01:08:13,616
Do you recognize me?

773
01:08:14,703 --> 01:08:16,463
I can't say that I do.

774
01:08:32,174 --> 01:08:33,710
This, I recognize.

775
01:08:35,885 --> 01:08:37,776
Well, I'm pregnant...

776
01:08:38,094 --> 01:08:40,655
So whatever you did, worked.

777
01:08:45,389 --> 01:08:47,887
Did you sing on that tape?

778
01:08:48,399 --> 01:08:49,231
Yeah.

779
01:08:50,415 --> 01:08:52,784
Me and an old girlfriend...

780
01:09:13,934 --> 01:09:15,728
Look, I'm really sorry.

781
01:09:19,949 --> 01:09:21,999
I don't have any way
of helping you out...

782
01:09:22,287 --> 01:09:24,047
- You know, financially...
- What?

783
01:09:29,805 --> 01:09:31,470
You've got your mama's eyes.

784
01:09:33,166 --> 01:09:36,494
The rest sort of looks like me.
Sorry about that.

785
01:09:41,742 --> 01:09:42,862
Oh shit!

786
01:09:43,086 --> 01:09:44,847
I don't even know your name.

787
01:09:46,254 --> 01:09:47,407
<i>Rachel.</i>

788
01:09:48,910 --> 01:09:50,480
<i>That's a beautiful name.</i>

789
01:09:53,615 --> 01:09:54,767
<i>Rachie.</i>

790
01:09:56,366 --> 01:09:57,519
<i>Just Rachel.</i>

791
01:09:57,677 --> 01:09:58,703
<i>OK.</i>

792
01:10:03,054 --> 01:10:06,127
<i>I'm looking for the man
who sings on that tape.</i>

793
01:10:06,286 --> 01:10:07,823
<i>Well, you found him.</i>

794
01:10:08,749 --> 01:10:11,726
<i>Guess it's not exactly
what you're looking for, though?</i>

795
01:10:19,726 --> 01:10:21,712
<i>Did you know my mother well?</i>

796
01:10:25,870 --> 01:10:27,310
I loved her.

797
01:10:36,845 --> 01:10:39,887
<i>I'm in the phone booth,
it's the one across the hall</i>

798
01:10:40,047 --> 01:10:42,832
<i>If I don't answer...
Let's try that again.</i>

799
01:10:44,366 --> 01:10:47,311
<i>I'm in the phone booth,
it's the one across the hall</i>

800
01:10:47,439 --> 01:10:50,318
<i>If you don't answer,
I'll just ring it off the wall</i>

801
01:10:50,477 --> 01:10:53,678
<i>I know he's there,
but I just had to call</i>

802
01:10:53,838 --> 01:10:57,774
<i>Don't leave me
hanging on the telephone</i>

803
01:10:57,935 --> 01:11:01,903
<i>Don't leave me
hanging on the telephone</i>

804
01:11:03,374 --> 01:11:05,872
<i>I gotta interrupt
and stop this conversation</i>

805
01:11:06,223 --> 01:11:08,655
<i>Your voice accross the line
gives me a strange sensation</i>

806
01:11:12,110 --> 01:11:15,728
<i>Instead of finding the father
of the son of God,</i>

807
01:11:17,102 --> 01:11:19,567
<i>I found my actual father.</i>

808
01:11:22,125 --> 01:11:25,006
(Phone ringing.)

809
01:11:34,605 --> 01:11:35,567
Hello?

810
01:11:36,142 --> 01:11:37,039
<i>Rachel?</i>

811
01:11:38,254 --> 01:11:39,246
Mr. Will?

812
01:11:39,566 --> 01:11:40,783
<i>Where's Snow?</i>

813
01:11:41,455 --> 01:11:43,151
I don't know.
Where are you?

814
01:11:43,310 --> 01:11:44,815
<i>Juvenile Hall.</i>

815
01:11:48,206 --> 01:11:48,975
Bye.

816
01:11:50,543 --> 01:11:53,168
- It was nice meeting you.
- You too.

817
01:11:54,286 --> 01:11:56,174
So, where are you going?

818
01:11:57,646 --> 01:12:01,038
My brother is in Juvenile Hall,
so...

819
01:12:01,454 --> 01:12:03,758
I should get there too.

820
01:12:04,335 --> 01:12:05,327
Yeah.

821
01:12:12,141 --> 01:12:13,006
Ok.

822
01:12:14,367 --> 01:12:15,583
- Bye.
- Bye.

823
01:12:36,168 --> 01:12:37,417
I like your cast.

824
01:12:40,521 --> 01:12:41,803
Did you...

825
01:12:42,120 --> 01:12:44,937
Did you pick blue
or did they pick it?

826
01:12:56,265 --> 01:12:57,609
What should I do?

827
01:13:00,554 --> 01:13:01,963
I don't know.

828
01:13:06,888 --> 01:13:07,850
Should I...

829
01:13:07,978 --> 01:13:09,354
Should I go back?

830
01:13:12,778 --> 01:13:13,961
I don't know.

831
01:13:28,650 --> 01:13:29,514
I'll...

832
01:13:30,217 --> 01:13:31,722
I'll confess.

833
01:13:33,290 --> 01:13:35,946
On this tape, for the record.

834
01:13:40,009 --> 01:13:41,833
They won't let me back now.

835
01:13:43,754 --> 01:13:45,545
Do you want to go back?

836
01:13:45,705 --> 01:13:46,570
Yes!

837
01:13:48,489 --> 01:13:49,578
Do you?

838
01:14:00,588 --> 01:14:01,133
Yes.

839
01:14:04,972 --> 01:14:06,285
<i>Dear Clyde,</i>

840
01:14:08,299 --> 01:14:11,276
<i>when I was a child,
I spoke as a child,</i>

841
01:14:11,755 --> 01:14:13,900
<i>I understood as a child,</i>

842
01:14:14,124 --> 01:14:15,980
<i>I thought as a child.</i>

843
01:14:17,772 --> 01:14:21,708
<i>But then I grew up,
and I put away childish things.</i>

844
01:14:22,603 --> 01:14:25,869
<i>For it is better,
if the will of God be so,</i>

845
01:14:25,995 --> 01:14:28,012
<i>that I suffer for well-doing.</i>

846
01:14:31,468 --> 01:14:32,621
<i>Rachel.</i>

847
01:15:16,716 --> 01:15:18,637
It's the best thing.

848
01:15:19,533 --> 01:15:21,453
They agreed to it already.

849
01:15:24,140 --> 01:15:28,237
If I do it, will you let
Mr. Will come back home?

850
01:15:31,723 --> 01:15:32,236
No.

851
01:15:36,779 --> 01:15:37,996
I'm sorry, Rachel.

852
01:15:45,419 --> 01:15:48,908
<i>And behold,
Mary was a spouse to Joseph.</i>

853
01:15:50,060 --> 01:15:53,773
<i>But before they came together,
she was found with child.</i>

854
01:15:55,980 --> 01:15:58,828
<i>Her husband, being a just man,</i>

855
01:15:59,020 --> 01:16:01,996
<i>and not willing
to make her a public example</i>

856
01:16:02,027 --> 01:16:03,916
<i>put her away privately.</i>

857
01:16:05,580 --> 01:16:07,757
<i>While he thought on
these things,</i>

858
01:16:07,916 --> 01:16:11,244
<i>the angel of the Lord
appeared to him in a dream,</i>

859
01:16:11,595 --> 01:16:14,476
<i>saying: "Joseph, fear not,</i>

860
01:16:15,051 --> 01:16:16,876
<i>"for that
which is conceived in her</i>

861
01:16:17,036 --> 01:16:18,061
<i>"is of God."</i>

862
01:16:40,235 --> 01:16:42,733
I'm looking for my nephew.

863
01:16:43,404 --> 01:16:45,740
Kind of dirty blonde hair...

864
01:16:46,541 --> 01:16:47,853
Face like an angel.

865
01:16:52,940 --> 01:16:54,221
Who are you?

866
01:16:54,956 --> 01:16:56,461
A family friend.

867
01:16:57,676 --> 01:16:59,085
Tell me who you are.

868
01:16:59,275 --> 01:17:01,260
Well,
I was looking for your sister.

869
01:17:01,516 --> 01:17:02,284
Why?

870
01:17:03,052 --> 01:17:05,005
I was going to give her
a ride home.

871
01:17:05,964 --> 01:17:07,340
She's already home.

872
01:17:07,724 --> 01:17:08,716
Yeah?

873
01:17:09,771 --> 01:17:11,468
Do you want a ride?

874
01:19:07,883 --> 01:19:09,132
That's her van!

875
01:19:26,092 --> 01:19:27,277
That's her boyfriend.

876
01:19:27,467 --> 01:19:29,356
Shit! She's got a boyfriend?

877
01:19:31,435 --> 01:19:32,556
Hey.

878
01:19:38,444 --> 01:19:39,532
Who are you?

879
01:19:42,923 --> 01:19:43,821
I'm Rachel's dad.

880
01:19:47,468 --> 01:19:49,388
Fucking parents, man.

881
01:19:58,187 --> 01:19:59,980
<i>Oh God, if you're there,</i>

882
01:20:00,556 --> 01:20:02,571
<i>get me the hell out of this.</i>

883
01:20:03,723 --> 01:20:05,644
<i>Make Clyde care.</i>

884
01:20:06,539 --> 01:20:07,787
<i>Just this once.</i>

885
01:20:09,451 --> 01:20:13,517
<i>Yours truly,
Rachel Angela McKnight, 15.</i>

886
01:20:19,115 --> 01:20:23,755
<i>For the beauty of the earth.</i>

887
01:20:23,947 --> 01:20:28,491
<i>For the beauty of the skies.</i>

888
01:20:28,780 --> 01:20:33,421
<i>For the love
which from our birth</i>

889
01:20:33,675 --> 01:20:38,348
<i>Over and around us lies.</i>

890
01:20:38,892 --> 01:20:43,659
<i>Lord of all, to thee we raise.</i>

891
01:20:43,883 --> 01:20:49,036
<i>This our hymn
of grateful praise.</i>

892
01:20:57,740 --> 01:20:59,917
Heavenly Father,
we thank you

893
01:21:00,555 --> 01:21:03,756
for the opportunity
to witness this glorious union

894
01:21:03,884 --> 01:21:05,900
between Rachel Angela

895
01:21:06,283 --> 01:21:10,477
and the righteous and diligent
Elijah Brooksby.

896
01:21:35,755 --> 01:21:36,812
What are we doing?

897
01:21:37,771 --> 01:21:39,564
Yeah, we should've planned this.

898
01:22:10,139 --> 01:22:11,356
Should we go?

899
01:22:12,923 --> 01:22:14,653
I should probably say something.

900
01:22:14,812 --> 01:22:16,990
Yeah, it's only right.

901
01:22:24,604 --> 01:22:25,437
Hello.

902
01:22:25,917 --> 01:22:26,653
Hi.

903
01:22:33,500 --> 01:22:35,229
This is my husband, Clyde.

904
01:22:37,340 --> 01:22:38,076
It's good to meet you.

905
01:22:40,188 --> 01:22:42,012
You guys look so much alike.

906
01:22:54,204 --> 01:22:55,326
Rachel...

907
01:22:57,116 --> 01:22:58,525
Your mother and I...

908
01:22:59,068 --> 01:23:00,893
we're so worried about you.

909
01:23:01,949 --> 01:23:03,006
No one's gonna judge you

910
01:23:03,132 --> 01:23:05,756
if you just step out of
that car...

911
01:23:17,661 --> 01:23:19,134
Was that your mom?

912
01:23:19,549 --> 01:23:20,286
Yeah.

913
01:23:25,372 --> 01:23:27,197
- Stop the car!
- What?

914
01:23:28,668 --> 01:23:29,724
Stop the car.

915
01:23:39,356 --> 01:23:40,316
I'm going back.

916
01:23:41,085 --> 01:23:41,725
Wait.

917
01:23:45,372 --> 01:23:46,236
