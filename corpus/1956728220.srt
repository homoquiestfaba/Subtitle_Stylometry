You know, most guys would
look at your reassignment

102

to the Pentagon
as what it is-- an honor.

103
00:04:48,113 --> 00:04:50,290
I've earned the right
to have my own command.

104

on your last day, skipper.

No, no, it's okay.

109
00:04:58,907 --> 00:05:00,996
I mean, we all have our way
of dealing with change.

110
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:03,607
Indeed we do.

111
00:05:06,958 --> 00:05:09,483
Okay, Doc,
so let's go over this again.

112
00:05:09,526 --> 00:05:11,485
Once you're at missile launch,
you've got three choices.

113
00:05:11,528 --> 00:05:13,835
First, you can just send that nasty thing to your target.

114
00:05:13,878 --> 00:05:16,707
Second, if you want to change your mind about who you want to nuke,

115
00:05:16,751 --> 00:05:18,318
you can pick
a secondary target.

116
00:05:18,361 --> 00:05:19,580
Or if you want
to disarm it,

117
00:05:19,623 --> 00:05:21,930
you just put in the code
and it self-destructs.

118
00:05:21,973 --> 00:05:23,540
It's pretty simple.

119
00:05:23,584 --> 00:05:24,933
Yeah, see how simple it is

120
00:05:24,976 --> 00:05:26,543
to put the hammer
to 20 million people?

121
00:05:26,587 --> 00:05:28,850
Oh, well, if you're having
second thoughts there, Doc,

122
00:05:28,893 --> 00:05:30,373
then maybe you should
just stick to medicine.

123
00:05:30,417 --> 00:05:33,681
Just because you'd rather be
home watching some game

124
00:05:33,724 --> 00:05:35,726
on high-def on DIRECTV...

125
00:05:35,770 --> 00:05:37,989
to me, this is the life.

126
00:05:38,033 --> 00:05:39,382
What more you got?

127
00:05:39,426 --> 00:05:41,689
All right, fine.

128
00:05:41,732 --> 00:05:43,125
Here's the code book.

129
00:05:43,168 --> 00:05:44,692
It has all
the self-destruct codes,

130
00:05:44,735 --> 00:05:46,215
but they change every day,

131
00:05:46,258 --> 00:05:48,522
so you got to stay up-to-date
before you come on duty.

132
00:05:48,565 --> 00:05:50,088
So if you want
to try that one,

133
00:05:50,132 --> 00:05:51,525
just put it in,

134
00:05:51,568 --> 00:05:54,310
and then it would
self-destruct.

00:07:54,561 --> 00:07:55,953
is one second too long.

180
00:07:55,997 --> 00:07:57,955
Get these people
to the conn.

181

Man:
Thank you.

182
00:07:59,174 --> 00:08:01,916
Sir, captain and crew
of the fishing boat.

183
00:08:01,959 --> 00:08:03,961
Captain,
I'd like to welcome you

184
00:08:04,005 --> 00:08:06,573
and your entire crew
aboard the USS Montana.

185
00:08:06,616 --> 00:08:08,444
Thank you, sir.

Man:
Hey, they got weapons.

188
00:08:13,754 --> 00:08:15,059
What the hell
do you think you're --

189
00:08:15,103 --> 00:08:16,191
Not now, Captain.

190
00:08:16,234 --> 00:08:17,366
We're taking the boat.

191
00:08:17,409 --> 00:08:19,586
Garrett,
disperse your men.

192
00:08:19,629 --> 00:08:21,588
Garrett:
Let's go! Move!

193
00:08:25,896 --> 00:08:27,463
- Hands!
- Steady.

194
00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:28,638
- Get up!
- Nobody move!

195
00:08:28,682 --> 00:08:29,857
Everybody,
hands in the air!

196
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:31,032
All right, don't shoot.
Don't shoot.

197
00:08:31,075 --> 00:08:34,078
- Don't fire.
- Take it easy.

198
00:08:34,122 --> 00:08:35,384
Easy.

199
00:08:35,427 --> 00:08:37,952
- Do as they say.
- All right. Take it easy.

200
00:08:39,562 --> 00:08:41,521

Go down!

201
00:08:41,564 --> 00:08:42,565
I got every single
one of you out here.

202
00:08:42,609 --> 00:08:45,394
Down.
Don't look.

203
00:08:45,437 --> 00:08:46,438
Come on.

204
00:08:51,269 --> 00:08:53,620
Get up. Get up.
Get up.

205
00:08:53,663 --> 00:08:56,492
Ugh.

206
00:08:56,536 --> 00:08:57,928
Come on!
Move it!

207
00:08:57,972 --> 00:08:59,234
Let's go.

- Quick.

What the hell are you
gonna do with my men?

212
00:09:09,766 --> 00:09:11,899
They'll be fine.

213
00:09:11,942 --> 00:09:14,684
Hey, Garrett,
put them on a boat.

214
00:09:14,728 --> 00:09:18,558
But don't worry.
They'll have you there to supervise them.

215
00:09:18,601 --> 00:09:20,690
You are out
of your damn mind.

216
00:09:20,734 --> 00:09:23,911
I finally have my command.

217
00:09:23,954 --> 00:09:27,523
Get this man off my sub.

218
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:28,959
Just a second.

219
00:09:32,180 --> 00:09:33,181
I might need this.

220
00:09:35,836 --> 00:09:38,099
I'll see you at your
court-martial.

221
00:09:39,317 --> 00:09:40,275
Man:
Go! Go!

222
00:09:40,318 --> 00:09:42,277
Move!
Everybody out!

223
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:43,844

- Move!

225
00:09:46,716 --> 00:09:50,111
Lieutenant, I believe you have something I want.

226
00:09:52,548 --> 00:09:53,854
That's it.

227
00:09:53,897 --> 00:09:56,465
I'll take the key.

228
00:09:56,508 --> 00:09:57,509
Get off my sub.

229
00:10:00,121 --> 00:10:01,296
When you hear
your name called,

230
00:10:01,339 --> 00:10:02,514

get that safe open and get me those firing keys now.

Garrett, have your men report to mess

once we're under way.

Move along. Move.

- Portside.

All right,
get up there.

245
00:10:36,548 --> 00:10:38,855
- All right.
- Secure it, team.

all these men on board.

- Sir?
- Yeah?

this off the sub.

255
00:10:56,743 --> 00:10:58,788
A radio. Great work.

256
00:10:58,832 --> 00:10:59,920

- Are they usable?
- We're down below, sir.

To any ship, any ship.

260
00:11:06,317 --> 00:11:09,494
This is Captain Daniel Lewis
of the USS Montana.

261
00:11:09,538 --> 00:11:12,497
Commander, we're picking up a distress call

262
00:11:12,541 --> 00:11:14,499
from Captain Lewis
and the crew of the Montana.

263
00:11:14,543 --> 00:11:16,850
They have a radio?

264
00:11:16,893 --> 00:11:18,416
I told you
we should kill them.

265
00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:20,157
You were supposed
to check them.

266
00:11:20,201 --> 00:11:25,293
Sir, that NATO patrol boat
is heading in our direction.

267
00:11:25,336 --> 00:11:28,122
They're responding to Captain Lewis' distress call.

268
00:11:28,165 --> 00:11:29,863

269
00:11:35,564 --> 00:11:38,306
Mr.
Allenson, take us down to periscope depth.

270
00:11:38,349 --> 00:11:41,831

Make our depth 150 feet.

Attention,
this is your captain.

274
00:12:01,851 --> 00:12:05,768
First, I want to congratulate
you all on a job well done.

275
00:12:05,812 --> 00:12:07,291
We are now the proud owners

276
00:12:07,335 --> 00:12:09,859
of the world's most
powerful nuclear submarine.

277
00:12:09,903 --> 00:12:12,296
The only one of its kind,
in fact.

278
00:12:12,340 --> 00:12:16,431
We will proceed to the East Coast of the United States,

279
00:12:16,474 --> 00:12:20,914
where we will hold the city of Washington, D.C.,
for ransom.

280
00:12:20,957 --> 00:12:24,004
Our price is $1 billion.

281
00:12:24,047 --> 00:12:26,180
That is billion with a "B."

282
00:12:26,223 --> 00:12:27,877
Once our demands are met,

283
00:12:27,921 --> 00:12:30,837
we will then proceed
to other sources of income--

284
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:33,665
London, Rome, Zurich.

285
00:12:33,709 --> 00:12:38,061
Once we have amassed enough
wealth to buy our safety,

286
00:12:38,105 --> 00:12:40,281
we will then disperse

287
00:12:40,324 --> 00:12:43,501
and live the lives
others can only dream about.

288
00:12:43,545 --> 00:12:45,503
Each of you has been chosen

289
00:12:45,547 --> 00:12:47,505
for your own
particular strengths,

290
00:12:47,549 --> 00:12:49,899
and I know
I can count on you

291
00:12:49,943 --> 00:12:51,727
to do whatever
needs to be done

292
00:12:51,771 --> 00:12:53,903
to carry out
and complete this mission.

293
00:12:53,947 --> 00:12:55,339
That is all.

294
00:12:57,341 --> 00:12:59,300
Commander,
the NATO vessel

295
00:12:59,343 --> 00:13:00,954
is demanding that
we surface immediately.

296
00:13:00,997 --> 00:13:03,478
I am captain of this sub,
Mr. Gerard,

297
00:13:03,521 --> 00:13:04,827
and you will
address me as such.

298
00:13:04,871 --> 00:13:06,873
Yes, sir, Captain.

299
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:21,278
Hmm. Mr. Allenson,
bring it up on the board.

300
00:13:21,322 --> 00:13:23,628

Open torpedo doors
two and three.

304
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:37,555
Aye, sir.
Open torpedo doors two and three.

305
00:13:37,599 --> 00:13:40,950
Sir, is this
absolutely necessary?

306
00:13:42,909 --> 00:13:45,476
They have made it
necessary, Mr. Allenson.

307
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:46,782
Fire torpedoes.

308
00:13:46,826 --> 00:13:48,871
Fire torpedoes.

309
00:13:48,915 --> 00:13:50,612
Fire torpedo two.

310
00:13:53,006 --> 00:13:54,355
Fire torpedo three.

311
00:14:06,323 --> 00:14:08,282
I'd say we're off
to a good start.

312
00:14:08,325 --> 00:14:09,892
Have you contacted
naval headquarters?

313
00:14:09,936 --> 00:14:11,894
Aye, sir.
Your message has been sent.

314
00:14:11,938 --> 00:14:12,895
Good.

315
00:14:16,072 --> 00:14:17,726
Yes?

316
00:14:17,769 --> 00:14:19,771
Mr. President,
we have a situation.

317
00:14:21,121 --> 00:14:22,383
What is it?

318
00:14:22,426 --> 00:14:24,080
One of our submarines,
the USS Montana,

319
00:14:24,124 --> 00:14:27,867
has been hijacked by terrorists led by the sub's X.O.,

320
00:14:27,910 --> 00:14:29,433
a Commander William Krieg.

321
00:14:29,477 --> 00:14:33,046
Also, a NATO patrol boat has gone missing in that same area.

322
00:14:33,089 --> 00:14:36,049
We fear she might have been
fired upon by the Montana.

323
00:14:36,092 --> 00:14:38,878
Montana?
That's the stealth prototype, isn't it?

324
00:14:38,921 --> 00:14:40,705
I'm afraid so, sir.

325
00:14:40,749 --> 00:14:42,403
Well, have them take us
to orange alert.

326
00:14:42,446 --> 00:14:44,100
Yes, sir.

327
00:14:49,323 --> 00:14:50,890

328
00:14:50,933 --> 00:14:52,282
Enter.

00:14:52,326 --> 00:14:55,982
Sir, this just came in
on the emergency channel.

"Emergency aboard USS Montana.
Possible casualties.

331

and await further orders."

332
00:15:03,293 --> 00:15:04,294
What do you think that means?

333
00:15:06,949 --> 00:15:08,864
I wish I knew.

00:15:14,957 --> 00:15:15,958
What are you guys
doing here?

335

Get off my sub!

this is Whiskey 14.

00:15:38,328 --> 00:15:41,331
- Mr. President.
- Please be seated.

340
00:15:41,375 --> 00:15:42,985
We have it, sir.

341
00:15:43,029 --> 00:15:44,030
Well, then, let's hear it.

342
00:15:45,770 --> 00:15:49,774
Gentlemen, I am William Krieg of the USS Montana.

343
00:15:49,818 --> 00:15:52,473
It is my duty to inform you

344
00:15:52,516 --> 00:15:55,693
as of 23:00 hours
this evening,

345
00:15:55,737 --> 00:15:59,045
I have assumed control
of this vessel.

346
00:15:59,088 --> 00:16:01,699
The Navy never saw fit
to give me my own command,

347
00:16:01,743 --> 00:16:04,485
so I have taken it.

348
00:16:04,528 --> 00:16:07,705
And since I'm in the driver's seat,
so to speak,

349
00:16:07,749 --> 00:16:10,099
I thought I would indulge
myself a little.

350
00:16:10,143 --> 00:16:14,930
I want $1 billion

351
00:16:14,974 --> 00:16:17,933
or I'm going to blow the city
of Washington, D.C.,

352
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:19,152
off the map.

353
00:16:19,195 --> 00:16:20,936
As you probably know,

354
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:24,331
the Montana is a one-of-a-kind submarine,

355
00:16:24,374 --> 00:16:27,595
equipped with 24 trident
ballistic missiles,

356
00:16:27,638 --> 00:16:29,292
and, of course,

357
00:16:29,336 --> 00:16:32,469
there's always the matter
of that stealth technology.

358
00:16:32,513 --> 00:16:34,254
$1 billion sounds like
a lot, I know,

359
00:16:34,297 --> 00:16:37,692
but look at it this way--

360
00:16:37,735 --> 00:16:42,914
$1 billion, and everyone
on Pennsylvania Avenue

361
00:16:42,958 --> 00:16:44,090
gets to wake up
in the morning.

362
00:16:44,133 --> 00:16:45,830
Not a bad deal, right?

363
00:16:45,874 --> 00:16:48,920
It is now 03:00.

364
00:16:48,964 --> 00:16:51,271
You have 18 hours.

365
00:16:51,314 --> 00:16:54,056
Instructions on how I'd like
the funds transferred

366
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:56,058
will be forthcoming.

367
00:16:56,102 --> 00:16:57,320
That is all.

368
00:16:57,364 --> 00:16:59,975
Mr. President,

369
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:02,282
we're being redirected
to a secure location.

370
00:17:02,325 --> 00:17:03,761
The Joint Chiefs are en route

371
00:17:03,805 --> 00:17:06,721
and will be standing by for
briefings upon your arrival.

372
00:17:06,764 --> 00:17:08,505
- Make it happen.
- Yes, sir.

373
00:17:10,551 --> 00:17:12,335
Yes, ma'am.
Right away.

374
00:17:13,293 --> 00:17:14,903
Communications room,
respond.

375
00:17:14,946 --> 00:17:16,426
Man on PA:
Communications secure.

376
00:17:16,470 --> 00:17:20,082
And, engine room, respond.

377
00:17:20,126 --> 00:17:22,867
Sir, I can't raise
Hernandez or Edwards.

378
00:17:22,911 --> 00:17:24,869
Well, send someone down
to check on them.

379
00:17:24,913 --> 00:17:26,697
Set the course.

380
00:17:26,741 --> 00:17:28,743
I'll be in my quarters.

381
00:17:28,786 --> 00:17:29,831
Aye, sir.

382
00:17:31,311 --> 00:17:35,097
Helmsmen, change course
to heading 260.

383
00:17:35,141 --> 00:17:38,100
All ahead three-quarters
to off the coast of Maryland.

384
00:17:38,144 --> 00:17:39,101
Man:
Aye, sir.

385
00:17:39,145 --> 00:17:39,884
Garrett?

386
00:17:39,928 --> 00:17:41,495
I'm here, Mr. Allenson.

387
00:17:41,538 --> 00:17:43,105
Hernandez and Edwards
aren't responding.

388
00:17:43,149 --> 00:17:44,889
Send someone to look for them in the engine room.

389
00:17:44,933 --> 00:17:46,326
- Right.
- Got it.

390
00:17:47,718 --> 00:17:48,937
Stand by.

391
00:17:49,981 --> 00:17:51,505
What happened?
Where's Edwards?

392
00:17:51,548 --> 00:17:52,723
He's dead.

393
00:17:52,767 --> 00:17:54,029
Let's move out.

394
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:55,291
[Knock on door]

395
00:17:59,513 --> 00:18:02,081
Enter.

396
00:18:02,124 --> 00:18:04,909
Sir, we have a problem.

397
00:18:09,305 --> 00:18:11,046
This is your captain.

398
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:13,701
We have one of the original
crew members still on board.

399
00:18:13,744 --> 00:18:15,268
This man is
extremely dangerous.

400
00:18:15,311 --> 00:18:17,922
If you see him, report
his position immediately.

401
00:18:17,966 --> 00:18:19,533
That is all.

402
00:18:34,461 --> 00:18:37,464
[Grunting]

403
00:18:37,507 --> 00:18:38,508
Hey!

404
00:18:40,075 --> 00:18:42,730
You were supposed to do
a headcount, Mr. Allenson.

405
00:18:42,773 --> 00:18:44,471
I was told everyone
was accounted for.

406
00:18:44,514 --> 00:18:46,690
Yes, sir,
and that information came from Mr. Gerard,

407
00:18:46,734 --> 00:18:48,083
chief of the boat.

408
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:50,259
Gerard, you were responsible
for off-loading my crew,

409
00:18:50,303 --> 00:18:52,957
were you not?

410
00:19:00,922 --> 00:19:03,185
Conn, come in.

411
00:19:04,273 --> 00:19:05,231
This is the captain.

412
00:19:05,274 --> 00:19:06,710
Get off my sub.

413
00:19:06,754 --> 00:19:08,147
Who is this?

414
00:19:14,631 --> 00:19:15,589
Mr. Garrett.

415
00:19:15,632 --> 00:19:17,330
We're on it, Captain.

416
00:19:17,373 --> 00:19:19,158
Find him
and bring him to me.

417
00:19:19,201 --> 00:19:20,898
Yes, sir.

418
00:19:33,781 --> 00:19:37,045
[Sirens]

419
00:19:47,751 --> 00:19:50,145
Atten-hut!

420
00:19:52,974 --> 00:19:54,236
Good evening, Mr. President.

421
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:56,107
Area's been secured.

422
00:19:56,151 --> 00:19:57,805
Joint Chiefs are standing by
to brief you, sir.

423
00:19:57,848 --> 00:19:59,981
- Thank you, top.
- Aye, aye, sir.

424
00:20:04,203 --> 00:20:05,508
[Shouts]

425
00:20:07,510 --> 00:20:09,860
Atten-hut!

426
00:20:10,948 --> 00:20:12,907
At ease. Admiral.

427
00:20:12,950 --> 00:20:14,604
Thank you for letting us
into your home, Mr. President.

428
00:20:14,648 --> 00:20:15,692
What do we know?

429
00:20:15,736 --> 00:20:16,867
He's got stealth technology,

430
00:20:16,911 --> 00:20:18,913
and he's threatening
Washington, D.C.

431
00:20:18,956 --> 00:20:21,263
He's already torpedoed
one NATO patrol vessel

432
00:20:21,307 --> 00:20:23,918
and an unidentified
fishing vessel.

433
00:20:23,961 --> 00:20:25,876
What are they actually capable
of doing to Washington?

434
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:27,356
The truth of the matter is

435
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:30,490
the Montana is capable of
outrunning and outgunning

436
00:20:30,533 --> 00:20:32,274
everything else in our Navy.

437
00:20:32,318 --> 00:20:34,058
There's a chance that he could
beat our intercept missile,

438
00:20:34,102 --> 00:20:35,277
and we wouldn't
even see it

439
00:20:35,321 --> 00:20:37,061
because
it's invisible to sonar.

440
00:20:37,105 --> 00:20:39,020
How fast can this Montana
actually go?

441
00:20:39,063 --> 00:20:41,022
10 knots faster
than anything we got.

442
00:20:41,065 --> 00:20:43,285
Don't we have
safeguards to prevent

443
00:20:43,329 --> 00:20:45,287
the launching of nuclear missiles from submarines?

444
00:20:45,331 --> 00:20:47,768
Yes, it takes two keys
to effect a missile launch.

445
00:20:47,811 --> 00:20:50,031
The captain has one and the weapons control officer.

446
00:20:50,074 --> 00:20:51,467
Yeah, all right.

447
00:20:51,511 --> 00:20:53,469
I want all available resources
brought into this area.

448
00:20:53,513 --> 00:20:56,864
I want the entire East Coast
blanketed with as many ships

449
00:20:56,907 --> 00:20:58,561
and aircraft
as we can muster.

450
00:20:58,605 --> 00:21:00,694
Then I want to know
everything there is to know

451
00:21:00,737 --> 00:21:01,869
about this Commander Krieg.

452
00:21:01,912 --> 00:21:03,914
Is he a lunatic acting alone,

453
00:21:03,958 --> 00:21:05,133
or is he part
of something bigger?

454
00:21:05,176 --> 00:21:06,134
Call Katie McCallister

455
00:21:06,177 --> 00:21:07,918
at the Central
Intelligence Agency.

456
00:21:07,962 --> 00:21:09,311
Tell her I need her here
yesterday.

457
00:21:09,355 --> 00:21:10,443
She's already
on her way, sir.

458
00:21:10,486 --> 00:21:11,444
Thank you.

459
00:21:11,487 --> 00:21:13,315
Assuming you're correct,
Admiral,

460
00:21:13,359 --> 00:21:15,883
let's get in touch with Captain Richards onboard the Florida.

461
00:21:15,926 --> 00:21:18,929
Have him track the last known
position of the Montana.

462
00:21:24,457 --> 00:21:26,459
Sir.

463
00:21:26,502 --> 00:21:27,851
Good work.

464
00:21:27,895 --> 00:21:30,332
Take this to Missile Control and stand by.

465
00:21:30,376 --> 00:21:31,899
Yes, sir.

466
00:21:31,942 --> 00:21:34,293
You know, I'm thinking.

467
00:21:34,336 --> 00:21:36,338
Maybe we should give
the President a little show,

468
00:21:36,382 --> 00:21:39,472
something that proves we're serious and have the ability

469
00:21:39,515 --> 00:21:41,691
and the balls
to carry out our threat.

470
00:21:41,735 --> 00:21:44,694
Sir, you've already
sunk a NATO boat

471
00:21:44,738 --> 00:21:47,088
and torpedoed
your Montanacrewmates.

472
00:21:47,131 --> 00:21:48,916
I think you've
made your point.

473
00:21:48,959 --> 00:21:50,091
I want to believe you,
Mr. Allenson.

474
00:21:50,134 --> 00:21:51,092
I do.

475
00:21:51,135 --> 00:21:53,094
But knowing the Joint Chiefs,

476
00:21:53,137 --> 00:21:54,487
they've got everything
under the sun

477
00:21:54,530 --> 00:21:55,618
gunning for us right now.

478
00:21:57,925 --> 00:21:59,448
What's so special
about that spot?

479
00:21:59,492 --> 00:22:01,320
Krieg:
Nothing.

480
00:22:01,363 --> 00:22:02,930
It's in the middle
of nowhere.

481
00:22:02,973 --> 00:22:04,845
Sir, if we launch
a nuclear warhead,

482
00:22:04,888 --> 00:22:06,063
everyone's gonna know
where we are.

483
00:22:07,891 --> 00:22:11,895
There.
Now, prepare to launch.

484
00:22:11,939 --> 00:22:12,940
Yes, sir.

485
00:22:15,812 --> 00:22:16,770
Weapons?

486
00:22:16,813 --> 00:22:17,945
Ready to launch.

[Beeping]

488
00:22:28,912 --> 00:22:30,305
Ready to launch, sir.

489
00:22:34,048 --> 00:22:35,702
Allenson on PA:
Prepare for missile launch.

490
00:22:35,745 --> 00:22:38,139
I repeat, prepare
for missile launch.

491
00:22:39,749 --> 00:22:42,230
Ready. Fire.

492
00:22:47,888 --> 00:22:50,107

Man:
Activating countermeasures.

494
00:22:59,334 --> 00:23:02,946
Sir, you've been ordered to find and follow the Montana.

495
00:23:02,990 --> 00:23:04,774
[Beeping]

496
00:23:04,818 --> 00:23:06,123
Sir?

497
00:23:08,387 --> 00:23:10,693
Man:
Air-tac is clear, sir.

498
00:23:10,737 --> 00:23:11,999
Is that what I think it is?

499
00:23:13,870 --> 00:23:14,871
[Man shouting indistinctly]

500
00:23:14,915 --> 00:23:16,090
Mr. President?

501
00:23:16,133 --> 00:23:18,962
The Montana just
launched a warhead.

502
00:23:19,006 --> 00:23:19,920
Our satellites
just picked it up.

503
00:23:19,963 --> 00:23:21,704
We're getting
a lock on it now.

504
00:23:21,748 --> 00:23:24,359
- Stand by for the rating!
- Tracking the location!

505
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:30,583
Almost there.

506
00:23:40,288 --> 00:23:42,986
Nice!

507
00:23:46,947 --> 00:23:48,339
Okay.

508
00:23:50,733 --> 00:23:52,909
A 5-megaton warhead
was just detonated

509
00:23:52,953 --> 00:23:54,433
in the middle
of the Atlantic Ocean.

510
00:24:15,628 --> 00:24:17,064
Oh!

511
00:24:18,065 --> 00:24:20,241
Aah!

512
00:24:20,284 --> 00:24:21,242
Shut it down.

513
00:24:21,285 --> 00:24:22,243
I can't.
They'll kill me.

514
00:24:22,286 --> 00:24:23,897
I'm gonna ask one more time.

515
00:24:23,940 --> 00:24:25,899
Aah! All right.

516
00:24:25,942 --> 00:24:28,423
- Shut it down!
- Get away from him.

517
00:24:29,903 --> 00:24:32,383
You use that scatter gun,
you'll kill us both.

518
00:24:32,427 --> 00:24:34,168
Is that what you want?

519
00:24:34,211 --> 00:24:35,561
You guys need me.

I'm the only one that can
maintain the reactor.

521

Go on.
Move out of the way.

522
00:24:41,784 --> 00:24:43,960
Keep moving.

where's he gonna go?

stay with him. Cline.

Damn, Doc.
What the hell is going on?

532
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:58,861
Commander Krieg
has lost his mind.

533

He's taken over the sub.

534
00:26:00,950 --> 00:26:02,691
Have you seen
any of our other crew?

535
00:26:02,735 --> 00:26:04,084
Uh, no,
I ain't seen nobody,

536
00:26:04,127 --> 00:26:05,912
but they know I'm here.

537
00:26:05,955 --> 00:26:07,391
Everybody's been
looking for me.

538
00:26:07,435 --> 00:26:10,003
Okay.
Do you know how far down these crawl spaces run?

539
00:26:10,046 --> 00:26:12,788
Uh, yeah.
They run all the way down to the stern almost.

540
00:26:12,832 --> 00:26:14,834
There's two of them.
There's this one and the one below.

541
00:26:14,877 --> 00:26:17,314
That's right. Good.
We're gonna need them to get around.

542
00:26:17,358 --> 00:26:18,533
What are we gonna do?

543
00:26:18,577 --> 00:26:19,839
We're gonna take
our sub back.

544
00:26:19,882 --> 00:26:24,974
- Say what?
- You heard me. Come on.

545
00:26:25,018 --> 00:26:27,977
Gerard, get me the President on the line.

546
00:26:28,021 --> 00:26:30,414
I want to make sure
he saw our show.

547
00:26:30,458 --> 00:26:31,720
Aye, aye, sir.

548
00:26:35,202 --> 00:26:36,682
President:
Commander.

549
00:26:36,725 --> 00:26:38,031
Mr. President.

550
00:26:38,074 --> 00:26:40,903
I hope you now see I am both capable and willing

551
00:26:40,947 --> 00:26:43,514
of using the weapons
at my disposal.

552
00:26:43,558 --> 00:26:45,691
I can just as easily
detonate a warhead

553
00:26:45,734 --> 00:26:46,909
over a populated area.

554
00:26:46,953 --> 00:26:48,868
Krieg, what is it
that you want from us?

555
00:26:48,911 --> 00:26:52,785
Only what I've asked for,
Mr. President.

556
00:26:52,828 --> 00:26:54,047
I will send you
the instructions

557
00:26:54,090 --> 00:26:58,051
for the wire transfer
of $1 billion.

558
00:26:58,094 --> 00:27:00,706
Do not attempt to alter
this plan in any way.

559
00:27:00,749 --> 00:27:02,882
That is all.

560
00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:19,333
Clear.

561
00:27:24,338 --> 00:27:25,644
This way.

562
00:27:30,518 --> 00:27:32,433
Oh!

563
00:27:32,476 --> 00:27:33,869
Ugh!

564
00:27:42,051 --> 00:27:44,837
Ah!

565
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:47,056
- Ah!
- You okay?

566
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:48,841
H-how bad is it?

567
00:27:48,884 --> 00:27:50,756
Let's see.
You're lucky.

568
00:27:50,799 --> 00:27:51,757
It's a through-and-through.

569
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:53,062
Come on. On three.
One, two, three.

570
00:27:53,106 --> 00:27:55,848
- Aah! Ah!
- Over on the desk.

571
00:28:01,462 --> 00:28:03,507
Just take it easy.
Take it easy.

572
00:28:03,551 --> 00:28:04,857
You'll be all right.

573
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:10,950
- You all right?
- Yeah. Oh.

574
00:28:17,913 --> 00:28:20,263
Yeah, you've got a story
for your girl now,

575
00:28:20,307 --> 00:28:21,917
I tell you what.

576
00:28:24,746 --> 00:28:26,269
Here you go.

577
00:28:26,313 --> 00:28:28,489
Ah! Oh! Ah!

578
00:28:28,532 --> 00:28:30,709
- Didn't hurt, did it?
- No more than getting shot.

579
00:28:30,752 --> 00:28:33,015
Listen, I want you to wait here till the bleeding stops.

580
00:28:33,059 --> 00:28:34,713
Where you going?

581
00:28:34,756 --> 00:28:35,931
I'm gonna go out there
and raise some hell,

582
00:28:35,975 --> 00:28:37,063
see if I can
slow them down a little bit

583
00:28:37,106 --> 00:28:38,281
till the Navy finds us.

584
00:28:38,325 --> 00:28:40,066
No, man.
You're gonna get yourself killed.

585
00:28:40,109 --> 00:28:42,416
You know how to use
one of these, right?

586
00:28:42,459 --> 00:28:43,896
Yeah, of course.

587
00:28:43,939 --> 00:28:48,552
Here. I'll call you
if I need you, all right?

588
00:28:48,596 --> 00:28:50,119
Good luck.

589
00:28:56,125 --> 00:28:57,300
Garrett?

590
00:28:57,344 --> 00:28:59,694
I'm here.

591
00:28:59,738 --> 00:29:00,956
Find him?

592
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,262
Garrett:
There's two of them.

593
00:29:02,305 --> 00:29:03,567
One of them went
after the reactor.

594
00:29:03,611 --> 00:29:04,568
Dugan stopped them.

595
00:29:04,612 --> 00:29:06,266
I want an armed guard

596
00:29:06,309 --> 00:29:07,833
in the reactor control room
immediately.

597
00:29:07,876 --> 00:29:09,791
Already taken care of.

598
00:29:09,835 --> 00:29:11,271
Find them before
they screw this up

599
00:29:11,314 --> 00:29:12,315
for all of us,
you hear me?

600
00:29:12,359 --> 00:29:14,013
Let's split up.

601
00:29:14,056 --> 00:29:15,884
Cover more ground.

602
00:29:15,928 --> 00:29:17,712
Go back to the mess.

603
00:29:17,756 --> 00:29:19,366
Call me
if you see anything.

604
00:29:45,522 --> 00:29:46,959
Ugh!

605
00:29:50,527 --> 00:29:51,746
Cline!

606
00:29:58,187 --> 00:29:59,754
Cline!

607
00:30:02,278 --> 00:30:05,368
[Grunting]

608
00:30:28,914 --> 00:30:30,263
- Sir?
- Yeah.

609
00:30:30,306 --> 00:30:32,874
We've just received another
emergency-action message.

610
00:30:32,918 --> 00:30:34,702
More info on the Montana.

611
00:30:34,745 --> 00:30:37,879
We're to continue to plot
an intercept course and pursue.

612
00:30:37,923 --> 00:30:40,055
Washington wants us
to keep them informed

613
00:30:40,099 --> 00:30:42,884
and await further information.

614
00:30:42,928 --> 00:30:44,103
All right.

615
00:30:44,146 --> 00:30:46,932
Well, we started
the stealth exercises here.

616
00:30:46,975 --> 00:30:50,283
The NATO vessel was destroyed right about there.

617
00:30:50,326 --> 00:30:52,502
They launched
their missile from there.

618
00:30:52,546 --> 00:30:56,506
Now, knowing that they average about 10 knots faster than us,

619
00:30:56,550 --> 00:30:58,291
I'd say that we should start looking for them

620
00:30:58,334 --> 00:31:00,946
right about there.

621
00:31:00,989 --> 00:31:04,297
Well, it certainly looks
like they're headed for D.C.

622
00:31:10,303 --> 00:31:12,305
[panting]

623
00:31:13,915 --> 00:31:15,743
[groaning]

624
00:31:19,529 --> 00:31:22,750
[panting]

625
00:31:27,973 --> 00:31:29,322
Okay.

626
00:31:35,067 --> 00:31:36,068
Piersall?

627
00:31:39,898 --> 00:31:40,855
What do you want?

628
00:31:40,899 --> 00:31:43,249
Listen, I need your help.

629
00:31:43,292 --> 00:31:45,033
All right, man,
where are you?

630
00:31:45,077 --> 00:31:46,078
I'm gonna come get you.

631
00:31:46,121 --> 00:31:50,473
No, no, no.
Don't worry about that.

632
00:31:50,517 --> 00:31:52,954
Can you get near the communications room without being seen?

633
00:31:52,998 --> 00:31:54,477
Why?

634
00:31:54,521 --> 00:31:56,958
We're gonna reach out
and touch someone.

635
00:31:57,002 --> 00:31:58,481
No, man.

636
00:31:58,525 --> 00:32:00,483
Look, just stay
where you're at,

637
00:32:00,527 --> 00:32:01,876
and let's let the Navy
handle this.

638
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:03,922
Piersall...

639
00:32:03,965 --> 00:32:04,923
What?

640
00:32:04,966 --> 00:32:07,229
We are the Navy.

641
00:32:07,273 --> 00:32:08,578
Doc!

642
00:32:10,189 --> 00:32:12,104
Doc!

643
00:32:15,542 --> 00:32:16,935
No way.

644
00:32:40,828 --> 00:32:44,092
[Grunts]

645
00:32:46,965 --> 00:32:50,055
[gasping]

646
00:32:54,798 --> 00:32:56,148
[groans]

647
00:33:01,327 --> 00:33:05,331
[panting]

648
00:33:05,374 --> 00:33:07,724
President:
The U.N.'s asking to meet.

649
00:33:07,768 --> 00:33:09,857
I have no idea
what to tell them.

650
00:33:09,900 --> 00:33:11,902
You know, there's
several prime ministers

651
00:33:11,946 --> 00:33:13,034
who would love to have
my head on a platter.

652
00:33:13,078 --> 00:33:14,427
- Sir?
- Uh-huh.

653
00:33:14,470 --> 00:33:15,906
Ms. McCallister
is here.

654
00:33:15,950 --> 00:33:16,907
Katie, have they briefed you on what's going on?

655
00:33:16,951 --> 00:33:18,039
Yes, Mr. President.

656
00:33:18,083 --> 00:33:19,693
I'm afraid I'm going
to make a bad day

657
00:33:19,736 --> 00:33:21,695
even worse for you, sir.

658
00:33:21,738 --> 00:33:23,653
Take a number.
What do you got?

659
00:33:23,697 --> 00:33:26,265
Well, what I have
is quite interesting.

660
00:33:26,308 --> 00:33:28,484
A quick search of Commander Krieg's apartment

661
00:33:28,528 --> 00:33:30,878
gives us plenty
to worry about, sir.

662
00:33:30,921 --> 00:33:34,273
He is your proverbial
loose canon.

663
00:33:34,316 --> 00:33:36,144
Found a journal
written by Krieg.

664
00:33:36,188 --> 00:33:38,364
Apparently
he wanted us to find it.

665
00:33:38,407 --> 00:33:42,150
It's a series of injustices with regard to his naval career.

666
00:33:42,194 --> 00:33:44,892
Also, he is heavily in debt.

667
00:33:44,935 --> 00:33:46,894
He is behind in alimony payments to his first wife.

668
00:33:46,937 --> 00:33:49,070
His second wife
just left him.

669
00:33:49,114 --> 00:33:50,637
We're trying to find her
as we speak.

670
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:54,684
And we found these
in his quarters.

671
00:33:54,728 --> 00:33:55,903
What are these?

672
00:33:55,946 --> 00:33:56,904
Tilafon, sir.

673
00:33:56,947 --> 00:33:59,037
It's a drug used
to shrink tumors.

674
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:01,039
In particular,
brain tumors.

675
00:34:01,082 --> 00:34:03,389
A brain tumor?

676
00:34:03,432 --> 00:34:05,086
Yes, sir.

677
00:34:05,130 --> 00:34:09,221
And one of the side effects of Tilafon is psychotic behavior.

678
00:34:16,141 --> 00:34:17,968
[Panting]

679
00:34:19,100 --> 00:34:20,058
- Hey.
- Hey!

680
00:34:20,101 --> 00:34:21,059
Piersall: Yo!

681
00:34:21,102 --> 00:34:22,712
I'm glad
you could make it.

682
00:34:22,756 --> 00:34:24,018
I couldn't help myself.

683
00:34:24,062 --> 00:34:25,498
- You ready?
- For what?

684
00:34:25,541 --> 00:34:27,978
Follow me. Come on.

685
00:34:32,157 --> 00:34:33,767
[Radio chatter]

686
00:34:37,292 --> 00:34:39,120
Get his radio.

687
00:34:42,732 --> 00:34:43,820
Piersall:
Did you see that, man?

688
00:34:43,864 --> 00:34:44,821
Whoo!

689
00:34:44,865 --> 00:34:46,258
That's straight warfare, man.

690
00:34:46,301 --> 00:34:47,259
These dudes don't know
who they messing with, man!

691
00:34:47,302 --> 00:34:49,261
Hey, you're scaring me.

692
00:34:49,304 --> 00:34:51,001
Oh, I'm cool, man.
I'm cool.

693
00:34:51,045 --> 00:34:53,395
Watch the hatch.

694
00:34:53,439 --> 00:34:54,918
Oh, okay.

695
00:34:58,357 --> 00:35:01,316
[Beeps]

696
00:35:12,936 --> 00:35:14,242
First name?

697
00:35:14,286 --> 00:35:17,289
James. What are you doing?

698
00:35:17,332 --> 00:35:19,073
Where's that gonna go?

699
00:35:19,117 --> 00:35:20,901
Satellite picks it up,

700
00:35:20,944 --> 00:35:22,076
bounces it over
to one of our ships,

701
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:23,860
and they pass it along
to Washington.

702
00:35:23,904 --> 00:35:25,340
The President's
gonna see my name?

703
00:35:25,384 --> 00:35:27,473
If we live through this,
they'll make a movie about us.

704
00:35:27,516 --> 00:35:28,952
Oh! I'm up for that.

705
00:35:28,996 --> 00:35:32,042
Who you think's
gonna play me? Denzel?

706
00:35:32,086 --> 00:35:36,482
I was thinking someone
more like Sammy Jackson.

707
00:35:36,525 --> 00:35:37,961
Piersall:
Oh, that's cool, too, man.

708
00:35:38,005 --> 00:35:39,963
I mean, Sam Jackson, Denzel,
whatever. That's cool.

00:36:09,341 --> 00:36:11,386
[Pinging]

717
00:36:11,430 --> 00:36:14,694
Sir, somebody
just launched a comm buoy

718
00:36:14,737 --> 00:36:16,478
from the communications shack.

719
00:36:16,522 --> 00:36:17,653
[Pinging continues]

720
00:36:22,136 --> 00:36:25,226
Sir, we've picked up the signal
from a communications buoy

721
00:36:25,270 --> 00:36:26,619
on our long-range radar.

722
00:36:26,662 --> 00:36:28,011
The entry code matches
the Montana's.

723
00:36:28,055 --> 00:36:30,927
[Indistinct chattering]

724
00:36:30,971 --> 00:36:32,494
Hold our present course.

725
00:36:32,538 --> 00:36:34,104
Steady as she goes.

726
00:36:34,148 --> 00:36:35,280
Aye, aye, sir.

727
00:36:44,114 --> 00:36:46,073
Communications, conn.

728
00:36:47,988 --> 00:36:50,120
Communications, conn.

729
00:36:55,517 --> 00:36:56,518
Hegan?

730
00:36:57,954 --> 00:37:00,914
Hegan is unavailable
right now.

731
00:37:00,957 --> 00:37:02,524
Who is this?

732
00:37:02,568 --> 00:37:04,874
Get off my sub.

733
00:37:04,918 --> 00:37:06,876
Talk to me.
We can work this out.

734
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:08,313
There's nothing
to talk about.

735
00:37:08,356 --> 00:37:11,054
Whoever you are,
listen to me.

736
00:37:11,098 --> 00:37:13,013
We will find you.

737
00:37:13,056 --> 00:37:16,843
And when we do,
you are a dead man.

738
00:37:16,886 --> 00:37:20,281
Your only chance to survive
is to give yourself up.

739
00:37:20,325 --> 00:37:22,675
No, you got it backwards,
Commander.

740
00:37:22,718 --> 00:37:24,242
I'll give you a chance
to surrender,

741
00:37:24,285 --> 00:37:26,244
and if not,
we're gonna kill every one of you.

742
00:37:28,463 --> 00:37:32,075
Okay.
If that's the way you want to play this.

743
00:37:32,119 --> 00:37:33,076
Garrett,
you listening to this?

744
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:34,121
I'm here.

745
00:37:34,164 --> 00:37:36,210
Communications shack,
get them.

746
00:37:36,254 --> 00:37:39,996
Rosen, Chang,
communications now.

747
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:42,608
[Pinging]

748
00:37:42,651 --> 00:37:46,002
[pinging continues]

749
00:37:53,923 --> 00:37:55,925
Son of a bitch.

750
00:37:59,407 --> 00:38:01,191
Very good.
Excuse me, sir.

751
00:38:01,235 --> 00:38:02,628
Yeah?

752
00:38:02,671 --> 00:38:04,586
We picked up a signal
from a communications buoy.

753
00:38:04,630 --> 00:38:05,718
We're trying to pinpoint

754
00:38:05,761 --> 00:38:06,849
exactly where
it was launched from.

755
00:38:06,893 --> 00:38:07,850
We're waiting
for the feed now.

756
00:38:07,894 --> 00:38:08,938
I'll keep you posted.

757
00:38:08,982 --> 00:38:10,592
- As soon as you know.
- Yes, sir.

758
00:38:14,379 --> 00:38:15,597
Doc: Watch out!
Watch out!

759
00:38:19,993 --> 00:38:21,168
Let's go!
Clear out!

760
00:38:31,918 --> 00:38:34,921
Garrett: I knew there was going to be a problem.

761
00:38:34,964 --> 00:38:36,966
Every time I think I...

762
00:38:37,010 --> 00:38:38,316
- [Garrett sighs]
- [footsteps fade]

763
00:38:38,359 --> 00:38:39,665
I'm out.

764
00:38:39,708 --> 00:38:41,449
I know.

765
00:38:41,493 --> 00:38:44,452
So when are they gonna send
somebody to rescue us?

766
00:38:44,496 --> 00:38:47,847
I wouldn't be thinking in terms of rescue right now, James.

767
00:38:47,890 --> 00:38:49,457
What?

768
00:38:49,501 --> 00:38:51,677
If they find this sub,
they'll sink it.

769
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:53,026
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa.

770
00:38:53,069 --> 00:38:56,072
Let me get this straight.

771
00:38:56,116 --> 00:38:58,292
We've been risking our lives
so the Navy can find us

772
00:38:58,336 --> 00:38:59,685
so they can kill us?

773
00:38:59,728 --> 00:39:00,860
That's about it.

774
00:39:00,903 --> 00:39:02,862
Well, how they gonna write
a movie about me

775
00:39:02,905 --> 00:39:04,298
if I'm not there
to tell them what happened?

776
00:39:04,342 --> 00:39:07,475
Listen, we got one chance
at coming out of this alive,

777
00:39:07,519 --> 00:39:09,042
and that's taking control
of this sub.

778
00:39:09,085 --> 00:39:10,913
How we gonna do that?

779
00:39:10,957 --> 00:39:12,698
We shut it down
one section at a time,

780
00:39:12,741 --> 00:39:14,003
and we pick them off
one by one.

781
00:39:14,047 --> 00:39:16,092
No, I can't do that.
I can't.

782
00:39:16,136 --> 00:39:17,093
Sure you can, James.

783
00:39:17,137 --> 00:39:19,487
All I know is that
when I got hit,

784
00:39:19,531 --> 00:39:20,923
you came out to help me.

785
00:39:22,490 --> 00:39:23,665
You can do this.

786
00:39:24,884 --> 00:39:26,233
[No audible dialogue]

787
00:39:26,276 --> 00:39:28,322
So, come on.

788
00:39:38,811 --> 00:39:40,900
Krieg on headset:
Garrett?

789
00:39:40,943 --> 00:39:41,988
We lost them.

790
00:39:42,031 --> 00:39:46,471
Mr. Garrett, you are
a disappointment.

791
00:39:46,514 --> 00:39:47,994
[Sighs]

792
00:39:53,956 --> 00:39:55,915
- Commander.
- Sir, it checks out.

793
00:39:55,958 --> 00:39:58,483
That communications buoy was released from the Montanaitself.

794
00:39:58,526 --> 00:39:59,962
By whom?

795
00:40:00,006 --> 00:40:02,661
Apparently two of the original crew are still on board.

796
00:40:02,704 --> 00:40:04,619
Commander,
hazard me a guess.

797
00:40:04,663 --> 00:40:05,620
Where is she?

798
00:40:05,664 --> 00:40:09,885
All right.
Well, we left her here.

799
00:40:09,929 --> 00:40:13,019
The communications buoy
was found right about there.

800
00:40:13,062 --> 00:40:16,849
So I would imagine that she's somewhere right around here.

801
00:40:16,892 --> 00:40:18,067
And we're here.

802
00:40:18,111 --> 00:40:20,069
Yes, sir.

803
00:40:22,681 --> 00:40:24,813
Doc: They got the reactor room covered.

804
00:40:26,119 --> 00:40:28,687
If you really want
to mess with these guys,

805
00:40:28,730 --> 00:40:31,907
we should go after
the electrical switchboards.

806
00:40:31,951 --> 00:40:33,518
Let's go.

807
00:40:36,477 --> 00:40:37,913
[Chattering]

808
00:40:37,957 --> 00:40:39,262
Mr. President? Sirs.

809
00:40:39,306 --> 00:40:41,395
I have more information
on Commander Krieg.

810
00:40:41,439 --> 00:40:43,484
Apparently,
he sought private treatment

811
00:40:43,528 --> 00:40:45,573
in order to maintain
his position in the Navy.

812
00:40:45,617 --> 00:40:47,053
He has less
than a year to live.

813
00:40:47,096 --> 00:40:49,838
[Sighs]

814
00:40:49,882 --> 00:40:52,841
Well, what have you got
on the two crew members

815
00:40:52,885 --> 00:40:54,495
still on board the Montana?

816
00:40:54,539 --> 00:40:56,497
John Ellers,
the ship's medical officer,

817
00:40:56,541 --> 00:40:58,673
and James Piersall,
an electrician's mate.

818
00:40:58,717 --> 00:41:02,068
Ellers is 34 years old,
parents unknown.

819
00:41:02,111 --> 00:41:03,896
Raised in a series
of foster homes

820
00:41:03,939 --> 00:41:05,071
until he graduated
from high school.

821
00:41:05,114 --> 00:41:07,290
He was quite a promising
young athlete

822
00:41:07,334 --> 00:41:09,728
and made something of a name for himself as an amateur fighter.

823
00:41:09,771 --> 00:41:10,946
Huh.

824
00:41:10,990 --> 00:41:12,295
McCallister: Enlisted in the Navy at age 25.

825
00:41:12,339 --> 00:41:14,297
He received two years
of advanced training

826
00:41:14,341 --> 00:41:16,691
to qualify as ship's
medical officer.

827
00:41:16,735 --> 00:41:19,302
Performance ratings are
across-the-board excellent.

828
00:41:19,346 --> 00:41:20,913
And Piersall?

829
00:41:20,956 --> 00:41:22,305
James Piersall,
electrician's mate.

830
00:41:22,349 --> 00:41:24,394
Qualified in weapons control.

831
00:41:24,438 --> 00:41:26,701
Enlisted in the Navy
two years ago.

832
00:41:26,745 --> 00:41:29,835
Transferred to submarine service six months ago.

833
00:41:29,878 --> 00:41:32,881
His service record...
also exemplary.

834
00:41:32,925 --> 00:41:34,666
Good.

835
00:41:34,709 --> 00:41:36,276
Well, let's do whatever we can to help these two heroes

836
00:41:36,319 --> 00:41:38,060
by buying them some time.

837
00:41:38,104 --> 00:41:39,540
Let's proceed as planned.

838
00:41:39,584 --> 00:41:41,673
Keep the Florida
tracking the Montana.

839
00:41:41,716 --> 00:41:43,675
We know they're heading towards the East Coast somewhere, right?

840
00:41:43,718 --> 00:41:44,806
Yes, sir.

841
00:41:44,850 --> 00:41:45,851
We still have all vessels
on high alert

842
00:41:45,894 --> 00:41:47,069
up and down the coast.

843
00:41:47,113 --> 00:41:48,506
Good.
Thank you.

844
00:41:48,549 --> 00:41:50,333
Thank you.

845
00:42:01,910 --> 00:42:04,086
Clear.

846
00:42:04,130 --> 00:42:05,131
Nice.

847
00:42:07,525 --> 00:42:08,482
Who are you?

848
00:42:08,526 --> 00:42:10,049
[Grunting]

849
00:42:25,281 --> 00:42:26,239
[panting]

850
00:42:26,282 --> 00:42:27,849
- Doc: Damn it.
- You okay?

851
00:42:27,893 --> 00:42:29,590
Yeah.

852
00:42:30,896 --> 00:42:33,376
Well, here's the arterial
system for the boat.

853
00:42:33,420 --> 00:42:34,377
All right.
What are we gonna do?

854
00:42:34,421 --> 00:42:36,075
Let's cause some chaos.

855
00:42:36,118 --> 00:42:37,598
Uh, where should we start?

856
00:42:37,642 --> 00:42:39,295
With the control room.

857
00:42:39,339 --> 00:42:40,862
You got it.

858
00:42:40,906 --> 00:42:42,951
Okay, here we go.

859
00:42:44,997 --> 00:42:47,434
Oh, they gonna be mad.

860
00:42:50,916 --> 00:42:51,873
Man:
What is it?

861
00:42:51,917 --> 00:42:53,309
Sir, we have total
loss of power.

862
00:42:53,353 --> 00:42:54,397
Krieg:
Go to auxiliary.

863
00:42:54,441 --> 00:42:56,661
Auxiliary is...
nonfunctional.

864
00:42:56,704 --> 00:42:57,792
Switch to
emergency generator.

865
00:42:57,836 --> 00:42:59,881
It should cross over
immediately.

866
00:42:59,925 --> 00:43:02,014
Doc on PA:
Conn, electronics.

867
00:43:02,057 --> 00:43:03,929
How's it going up there,
Captain?

868
00:43:03,972 --> 00:43:05,539
Man:
Don't worry about it.

869
00:43:06,932 --> 00:43:09,499
You can run,
but you can't hide, mister.

870
00:43:09,543 --> 00:43:10,892
We will find you.

871
00:43:10,936 --> 00:43:12,198
You keep finding us,

872
00:43:12,241 --> 00:43:13,678
pretty soon,
you won't have a crew.

873
00:43:13,721 --> 00:43:16,332
It's only a matter of time.
Trust me.

874
00:43:23,339 --> 00:43:24,645
Send someone up
to electrics.

875
00:43:24,689 --> 00:43:26,691
Rosen, Moore,
find Garrett,

876
00:43:26,734 --> 00:43:28,040
get up to the electric room,
and find out

877
00:43:28,083 --> 00:43:29,389
- what the hell's going on.
- Aye, aye, sir.

878
00:43:29,432 --> 00:43:30,738
Captain...

879
00:43:30,782 --> 00:43:32,871
running off the generator
leaves us crippled.

880
00:43:32,914 --> 00:43:34,873
We won't be able
to maintain stealth mode.

881
00:43:34,916 --> 00:43:36,657
We'll be visible on sonar,

882
00:43:36,701 --> 00:43:37,876
and we won't be able
to operate

883
00:43:37,919 --> 00:43:39,051
our weapons systems.

884
00:43:39,094 --> 00:43:41,836
Our speed will drop
to a crawl.

885
00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:43,272
I'm aware of that,
Mr. Gerard,

886
00:43:43,316 --> 00:43:44,665
but nautical sonar,

887
00:43:44,709 --> 00:43:46,667
it only has range
of 35 miles,

888
00:43:46,711 --> 00:43:48,930
and it's a big ocean
out there.

889
00:43:48,974 --> 00:43:52,717
[Pinging]

890
00:43:55,981 --> 00:43:57,852
Captain, we have
a contact bearing 260.

891
00:43:57,896 --> 00:43:59,985
- Range 12,000 yards.
- Sonar? Ident?

892
00:44:00,028 --> 00:44:01,073
Stand by, sir.

893
00:44:01,116 --> 00:44:02,683
Let's hope it's the Montana.

894
00:44:02,727 --> 00:44:03,902
Maybe their
stealth went down.

895
00:44:03,945 --> 00:44:06,165
Contact identified
as a Russian trawler.

896
00:44:06,208 --> 00:44:07,949
Sorry, sir.

897
00:44:14,913 --> 00:44:16,871
[Sighs]
Come on.

898
00:44:16,915 --> 00:44:18,612
Come on, come on.
Where are you?

899
00:44:18,656 --> 00:44:22,529
[Alarm blaring]

900
00:44:28,535 --> 00:44:30,885
[sighs]

901
00:44:30,929 --> 00:44:32,887
Go up there, work your way
around the ship.

902
00:44:32,931 --> 00:44:34,497
Create as much
diversion as you can.

903
00:44:34,541 --> 00:44:36,064
I'm gonna try and make it
back to the control room.

904
00:44:36,108 --> 00:44:38,501
Wait-- So you want me to run around and get shot at?

905
00:44:38,545 --> 00:44:39,938
- Yeah.
- I already done that, man.

906
00:44:39,981 --> 00:44:40,939
Do you see this leg?

907
00:44:40,982 --> 00:44:42,070
Look, we've both been shot,

908
00:44:42,114 --> 00:44:43,898
but that's nothing
like being dead,

909
00:44:43,942 --> 00:44:45,073
which is what
we're both gonna be

910
00:44:45,117 --> 00:44:46,901
if you don't
help me out here.

911
00:44:46,945 --> 00:44:47,859
Now, come on, get up there.

912
00:44:47,902 --> 00:44:50,339
Damn.

913
00:44:55,083 --> 00:44:56,041
I don't like you, man.

914
00:44:56,084 --> 00:44:57,303
Doc: I know.

915
00:45:00,523 --> 00:45:02,700
[Alarm continues]

916
00:45:18,324 --> 00:45:20,108
Oh, man.

917
00:45:23,329 --> 00:45:24,809
Is she alive?

918
00:45:24,852 --> 00:45:27,899
Yes, but she's hurt bad.

919
00:45:30,945 --> 00:45:33,339
Get to work.
See if you can fix this mess.

920
00:45:34,470 --> 00:45:35,863
Where's Moore?

921
00:45:35,907 --> 00:45:37,343
I don't know.
He was right behind me.

922
00:45:38,866 --> 00:45:41,477
Did you hear anything?

923
00:45:41,521 --> 00:45:43,871
No. Son of a bitch!
I didn't hear a damn thing.

924
00:45:43,915 --> 00:45:45,264
Get to work.
Find out what's wrong.

925
00:45:45,307 --> 00:45:47,179
- Where are you going?
- To go find Moore.

926
00:45:47,222 --> 00:45:50,878
Bunch of...
Son of a bitch.

927
00:45:53,925 --> 00:45:55,361
Electric,
this is the captain.

928
00:45:58,756 --> 00:46:00,235
This is Rosen, sir.

929
00:46:00,279 --> 00:46:01,454
What's the situation?

930
00:46:01,497 --> 00:46:02,847
They cut the wiring
into the control board.

931
00:46:02,890 --> 00:46:05,284
It's gonna take me a while
to straighten it out, sir.

932
00:46:05,327 --> 00:46:06,502
- How long?
- I don't know.

933
00:46:06,546 --> 00:46:07,895
A couple hours,
maybe more.

934
00:46:07,939 --> 00:46:09,897
How will this affect
the reactor?

935
00:46:09,941 --> 00:46:11,943
The reactor's self-contained,
sir, so it's not a problem,

936
00:46:11,986 --> 00:46:13,292
but until I can
repair the wire,

937
00:46:13,335 --> 00:46:15,642
we can't use any power
provided by the reactor.

938
00:46:15,685 --> 00:46:17,862
All right, move as fast
as you can, Rosen.

939
00:46:17,905 --> 00:46:19,951
Yes, sir, Captain.

940
00:46:21,300 --> 00:46:23,563
- Mr. Gerard.
- Sir.

941
00:46:23,606 --> 00:46:24,869
Go up to electric.

942
00:46:24,912 --> 00:46:26,914
I believe Mr. Rosen
requires motivation.

943
00:46:26,958 --> 00:46:28,089
Aye, aye, sir.

944
00:46:29,090 --> 00:46:30,918
And find out where
my goddamn money is.

945
00:46:30,962 --> 00:46:32,877
Yes, sir.

946
00:46:45,803 --> 00:46:48,109
Man: Get up there and clear
the forward compartment.

947
00:46:49,589 --> 00:46:51,504
Through there.
Yeah.

948
00:46:51,547 --> 00:46:52,853
Doc on walkie-talkie: Piersall, are you there?

949
00:46:52,897 --> 00:46:54,899
- Is that yours?
- No, what was it?

950
00:46:54,942 --> 00:46:56,857
- It's not mine.
- Piersall!

951
00:46:56,901 --> 00:46:58,163
Where the hell are you?

952
00:46:58,206 --> 00:46:59,991
It's below us.
Come on, come on!

953
00:47:10,915 --> 00:47:12,046
Excuse me, Mr. President.

954
00:47:12,090 --> 00:47:14,005
We just got a message
from Krieg.

955
00:47:14,048 --> 00:47:16,703
He wants to know
where his money is.

956
00:47:16,746 --> 00:47:20,054
I'm supposed to just wire-transfer him $1 billion?

957
00:47:20,098 --> 00:47:22,709
It's unbelievable.

958
00:47:22,752 --> 00:47:24,493
All right,
I need you to buy us some more time.

959
00:47:24,537 --> 00:47:26,974
Just convince him that these things don't happen instantly.

960
00:47:27,018 --> 00:47:28,497
Yes, sir.

961
00:47:28,541 --> 00:47:30,064
Any news from the Florida?

962
00:47:30,108 --> 00:47:32,893
Still in pursuit,
but no word.

963
00:47:32,937 --> 00:47:34,329
Thank you.

964
00:47:58,919 --> 00:48:02,923
[Breathing heavily]

965
00:48:18,939 --> 00:48:20,288
[indistinct chatter]

966
00:48:20,332 --> 00:48:23,857
Sir?
Our long-range scanner's picking something up.

967
00:48:23,901 --> 00:48:24,989
It's weak, but it's big,

968
00:48:25,032 --> 00:48:25,990
and it's moving
southwest.

969
00:48:26,033 --> 00:48:30,864
Could be anything.
Stay on course.

970
00:48:30,908 --> 00:48:32,561
It won't be long now.

971
00:48:42,528 --> 00:48:43,921
What's taking so long?

972
00:48:43,964 --> 00:48:45,357
What's taking so long?
Look at this mess!

973
00:48:45,400 --> 00:48:46,706
I'm not
the electronics expert.

974
00:48:46,749 --> 00:48:47,925
She is.

975
00:48:47,968 --> 00:48:49,752
Chang, get to work.

976
00:48:54,975 --> 00:48:57,064
You have an hour.

977
00:48:57,108 --> 00:48:58,631
[Sighs]

978
00:49:28,313 --> 00:49:30,489
I'm stepping off the conn.

979
00:49:30,532 --> 00:49:32,360
Aye, sir.

980
00:49:34,319 --> 00:49:37,365
[Groans]

981
00:49:40,629 --> 00:49:43,502
Do you have something
to say to me, Mr. Allenson?

982
00:49:43,545 --> 00:49:45,330
No, sir.

983
00:50:06,394 --> 00:50:08,092
Doc on walkie-talkie:
Commander.

984
00:50:15,969 --> 00:50:17,579
You know,
you're beginning to annoy me.

985
00:50:17,623 --> 00:50:22,410
Well, I've decided to let you surface and get off my sub.

986
00:50:22,454 --> 00:50:24,282
I admire your arrogance,
but so far,

987
00:50:24,325 --> 00:50:25,935
you haven't accomplished much,
have you?

988
00:50:25,979 --> 00:50:29,635
No, but we decreased the surplus population on the sub.

989
00:50:29,678 --> 00:50:31,115
You're running out of time,
mister.

990
00:50:31,158 --> 00:50:33,726
So are you.

991
00:50:35,728 --> 00:50:38,731
Sir, we have a fire
in the trash room.

992
00:50:38,774 --> 00:50:40,907
- [Alarm blaring]
- Garrett!

993
00:50:40,950 --> 00:50:43,953
[Alarm continues]

994
00:50:46,913 --> 00:50:48,567
Come on, come on!

995
00:50:48,610 --> 00:50:50,699
Quick, quick!

996
00:50:51,918 --> 00:50:53,876
[Fire extinguisher hissing]

997
00:50:59,317 --> 00:51:00,970
Good job, Piersall.

998
00:51:03,930 --> 00:51:06,889
Rosen, go down to the reactor room and make sure it's secure.

999
00:51:06,933 --> 00:51:09,240
If need be,
put another man there

1000
00:51:09,283 --> 00:51:11,894
and get down
to the missile room.

1001
00:51:11,938 --> 00:51:13,679
Double up on
security there, as well.

1002
00:51:13,722 --> 00:51:15,463
And what are we gonna do
when we run out of men?

1003
00:51:15,507 --> 00:51:17,726
Just do as you're told!

1004
00:51:27,301 --> 00:51:28,955
I see him!
We're going after him!

1005
00:51:28,998 --> 00:51:30,348
Where?
Give me your location.

1006
00:51:30,391 --> 00:51:32,306
Third level,
near the auxiliary machine room!

1007
00:51:33,481 --> 00:51:34,917
Okay, come with me.

1008
00:51:53,806 --> 00:51:55,242
Doc: I need your help bad, Piersall.

1009
00:51:55,286 --> 00:51:56,678
Come in.

1010
00:51:56,722 --> 00:51:57,853
You hear that?

1011
00:51:57,897 --> 00:51:59,072
Piersall?

1012
00:51:59,116 --> 00:52:00,160
I got him.

1013
00:52:01,944 --> 00:52:03,990
Doc:
Piersall, come in.

1014
00:52:06,123 --> 00:52:07,863
Piersall,
I've been shot.

1015
00:52:07,907 --> 00:52:10,866
Come on, he's hurt.

1016
00:52:10,910 --> 00:52:12,259
Let's wrap this up.

1017
00:52:12,303 --> 00:52:15,697
Doc: Where are you?
Where are you?

1018
00:52:15,741 --> 00:52:16,872
Piersall,
where are you?

1019
00:52:16,916 --> 00:52:18,091
Where are you?
Come in!

1020
00:52:18,135 --> 00:52:20,137
Damn it!
Son of a...

1021
00:52:40,287 --> 00:52:42,985
Commander, you have three less mouths to feed.

1022
00:52:43,029 --> 00:52:45,292
Son of a bitch.

1023
00:52:45,336 --> 00:52:46,946
Get off my sub.

1024
00:52:54,954 --> 00:52:56,216
Mr. President?

1025
00:52:56,260 --> 00:52:57,870
Ah, you found me.

1026
00:52:57,913 --> 00:53:01,134
I was just trying
to get some fresh air.

1027
00:53:02,483 --> 00:53:03,702
What's up?

1028
00:53:03,745 --> 00:53:05,094
I've been talking
with the Joint Chiefs,

1029
00:53:05,138 --> 00:53:08,489
and the consensus is
that given the capabilities

1030
00:53:08,533 --> 00:53:12,058
of a nuclear submarine equipped with stealth technology,

1031
00:53:12,101 --> 00:53:15,670
our chances of tracking him down are very slim.

1032
00:53:15,714 --> 00:53:18,673
So you think I should give him what he wants?

1033
00:53:18,717 --> 00:53:19,892
As much as it pains me
to say so,

1034
00:53:19,935 --> 00:53:21,023
yes, sir.

1035
00:53:21,067 --> 00:53:23,069
We can always
track him down later.

1036
00:53:23,112 --> 00:53:24,897
Damn it.

1037
00:53:24,940 --> 00:53:26,246
Sorry, Admiral.

1038
00:53:26,290 --> 00:53:27,682
I'm just-- I'm having a hard time coping with this.

1039
00:53:27,726 --> 00:53:31,599
For the first time,
I'm truly at a loss.

1040
00:53:31,643 --> 00:53:34,036
What do you do when
one of your own turns on you?

1041
00:53:34,080 --> 00:53:37,910
You blow him out
of the water, sir.

1042
00:53:37,953 --> 00:53:40,478
Two days ago,
I would've said that Commander Krieg

1043
00:53:40,521 --> 00:53:41,914
was one of our own
and he couldn't--

1044
00:53:41,957 --> 00:53:43,263
he wouldn't have turned
on his country,

1045
00:53:43,307 --> 00:53:44,917
but he's mad as a hatter,

1046
00:53:44,960 --> 00:53:47,267
and I will not set him loose
on the rest of the world.

1047
00:53:47,311 --> 00:53:48,921
Yes, sir.

1048
00:53:48,964 --> 00:53:51,924
I will go on record as supporting your decision 100 %.

1049
00:53:54,927 --> 00:53:57,669
I appreciate that, Bob.

1050
00:53:57,712 --> 00:53:59,714
- More than you know.
- Yes, sir.

1051
00:54:11,726 --> 00:54:13,859
Captain,
this is the X.O.

1052
00:54:13,902 --> 00:54:15,295
Go ahead, X.O.

1053
00:54:15,339 --> 00:54:17,863
Sir, sonar has a contact
at 27 miles.

1054
00:54:17,906 --> 00:54:19,299
She's going slow.

1055
00:54:19,343 --> 00:54:21,910
We think it might be
theMontana.

1056
00:54:21,954 --> 00:54:22,911
I'll be right there,
Commander.

1057
00:54:22,955 --> 00:54:24,870
Change course to intercept.

1058
00:54:34,358 --> 00:54:36,534
[Panting]

1059
00:55:03,343 --> 00:55:04,431
Hold it.

1060
00:55:05,911 --> 00:55:07,521
Give it to me.

1061
00:55:13,919 --> 00:55:16,878
Got to give it to you,
you're good.

1062
00:55:16,922 --> 00:55:17,836
You're real good.

1063
00:55:17,879 --> 00:55:18,880
You better hurry up
and shoot me

1064
00:55:18,924 --> 00:55:20,447
before I kick
your ass again.

1065
00:55:20,491 --> 00:55:21,448
What?

1066
00:55:21,492 --> 00:55:22,841
Go ahead,
get it over with.

1067
00:55:24,103 --> 00:55:27,672
Uh, what are you doing?

1068
00:55:27,715 --> 00:55:29,195
I'm going to
take him apart.

1069
00:55:29,238 --> 00:55:30,196
Dugan:
Don't be stupid.

1070
00:55:30,239 --> 00:55:31,240
Come on.

1071
00:55:34,983 --> 00:55:36,942
[Grunting]

1072
00:55:40,119 --> 00:55:42,861
Soft in the middle
like I figured.

1073
00:55:42,904 --> 00:55:44,689
Having fun?

1074
00:55:44,732 --> 00:55:46,821
- [Groans]
- Come on, hotshot.

1075
00:55:46,865 --> 00:55:48,170
Get up.

1076
00:55:53,350 --> 00:55:56,396
This is what you guys
were afraid of?

1077
00:55:56,440 --> 00:55:59,051
On your feet, hotshot.
Let's get this over with.

1078
00:55:59,094 --> 00:56:00,835
Say good night, pal.

1079
00:56:11,716 --> 00:56:13,108
Good night, pal.

1080
00:56:19,201 --> 00:56:21,378
Electric,
we're out of time.

1081
00:56:21,421 --> 00:56:23,945
10 minutes, Captain.
10 minutes.

1082
00:56:29,342 --> 00:56:31,692
Captain, sonar has
a positive I.D.

1083
00:56:31,736 --> 00:56:32,998
Contact is the Montana.

1084
00:56:33,041 --> 00:56:35,696
Sound general quarters.
Set battle stations.

1085
00:56:35,740 --> 00:56:38,090
Aye, aye, sir.
Set battle stations.

1086
00:56:38,133 --> 00:56:39,657
Battle stations,
battle stations!

1087
00:56:39,700 --> 00:56:41,876
All hands,
man your battle stations.

1088
00:56:41,920 --> 00:56:43,225
It's about damn time.

1089
00:56:50,494 --> 00:56:52,147
Garrett.
Come in, Garrett.

1090
00:56:52,191 --> 00:56:55,847
Find as many men as you can
and report back to me.

1091
00:56:55,890 --> 00:56:56,891
Yes, sir.

1092
00:57:00,068 --> 00:57:01,722
As you were.

1093
00:57:04,333 --> 00:57:06,510
- We got him.
- Doc!

1094
00:57:06,553 --> 00:57:11,297
- Commander Krieg.
- Captain Krieg.

1095
00:57:11,340 --> 00:57:12,516
That will be all,
Mr. Garrett.

1096
00:57:16,911 --> 00:57:20,045
So... where's your partner?

1097
00:57:20,088 --> 00:57:21,960
I have no idea.

1098
00:57:27,705 --> 00:57:31,665
If I don't get
my systems back,

1099
00:57:31,709 --> 00:57:33,885
I will have failed
in my mission.

1100
00:57:33,928 --> 00:57:36,365
No, you failed as soon
as you betrayed your crew.

1101
00:57:36,409 --> 00:57:37,845
They weren't my crew, Doc.

1102
00:57:37,889 --> 00:57:39,499
They belonged
to somebody else.

1103
00:57:39,543 --> 00:57:42,067
You were one of us.
We trusted you.

1104
00:57:42,110 --> 00:57:44,896
And I trusted the U.S. Navy.

1105
00:57:44,939 --> 00:57:47,072
The world's a different
place now, Doc.

1106
00:57:47,115 --> 00:57:48,682
The terrorists
are calling the shots,

1107
00:57:48,726 --> 00:57:51,511
in case
you hadn't noticed.

1108
00:57:51,555 --> 00:57:54,775
Anyone with enough firepower
can start their own war.

1109
00:57:54,819 --> 00:57:57,517
We're competing on the same field as savages.

1110
00:57:57,561 --> 00:57:59,693
This sub can't
defend itself any longer.

1111
00:57:59,737 --> 00:58:01,042
You're crippled, Commander.

1112
00:58:01,086 --> 00:58:03,262
I will not be defeated.

1113
00:58:03,305 --> 00:58:05,525
This is my time in history.

1114
00:58:05,569 --> 00:58:06,787
I was destined for this.

1115
00:58:06,831 --> 00:58:07,832
Destined for what?

1116
00:58:07,875 --> 00:58:09,268
Extorting money
from the country

1117
00:58:09,311 --> 00:58:10,661
that trained
and supported you?

1118
00:58:10,704 --> 00:58:13,490
Doc, the money
is not important.

1119
00:58:13,533 --> 00:58:15,274
It's a symbol.

1120
00:58:15,317 --> 00:58:18,146
It's a symbol
of my superiority.

1121
00:58:18,190 --> 00:58:22,890
My mission has always been
to eradicate terrorism.

1122
00:58:22,934 --> 00:58:24,892
Every day,
for the past 20 years,

1123
00:58:24,936 --> 00:58:26,067
that's been my mission,

1124
00:58:26,111 --> 00:58:29,027
and now
it's my ultimate goal.

1125
00:58:30,985 --> 00:58:34,598
Let there be light.

1126
00:58:34,641 --> 00:58:35,599
Gerard.

1127
00:58:35,642 --> 00:58:38,297
Captain, she's done it.

1128
00:58:38,340 --> 00:58:39,385
We're back online.

1129
00:58:39,428 --> 00:58:41,561
Good work.
Report back to the conn.

1130
00:58:41,605 --> 00:58:43,737
I'm glad you're here, Doc.

1131
00:58:43,781 --> 00:58:46,827
I want someone who understands the level of accomplishment here.

1132
00:58:46,871 --> 00:58:50,570
You will bear witness
to what I'm about to do.

1133
00:58:50,614 --> 00:58:54,008
Conn, sonar.
We have a contact bearing 180.

1134
00:58:54,052 --> 00:58:55,880
Range 2,200 yards.

1135
00:58:57,316 --> 00:58:59,187
Sonar, conn.
Understood.

1136
00:58:59,231 --> 00:59:00,885
Mr. Allenson,
go to stealth mode.

1137
00:59:00,928 --> 00:59:04,715
Aye, aye, sir.
Going to stealth.

1138
00:59:04,758 --> 00:59:06,586
Stealth in 60 seconds
and counting, sir.

1139
00:59:06,630 --> 00:59:09,110
Sonar, conn.
Can you identify the contact?

1140
00:59:10,459 --> 00:59:11,460
It's the Florida.

1141
00:59:15,552 --> 00:59:16,553
Major.

1142
00:59:17,902 --> 00:59:18,903
At ease.

1143
00:59:18,946 --> 00:59:21,558
So, what have we got,
gentlemen?

1144
00:59:21,601 --> 00:59:23,821
Sir, the Florida has found the Montana and will engage.

1145
00:59:23,864 --> 00:59:27,041
I would never have imagined
ordering an American vessel

1146
00:59:27,085 --> 00:59:28,608
to fire on one of its own.

1147
00:59:28,652 --> 00:59:30,001
We have no other option.

1148
00:59:30,044 --> 00:59:33,265
I appreciate that, Admiral.

1149
00:59:33,308 --> 00:59:34,919
It doesn't make it
any easier.

1150
00:59:40,141 --> 00:59:41,665
Give me a firing solution.

1151
00:59:41,708 --> 00:59:42,666
Flood tubes three and four.

1152
00:59:42,709 --> 00:59:43,884
Aye, aye, sir.

1153
00:59:43,928 --> 00:59:45,233
Flood tubes
three and four.

1154
00:59:46,583 --> 00:59:47,801
Allenson: 20 seconds to stealth, Captain.

1155
00:59:47,845 --> 00:59:49,498
Steady as she goes.

1156
00:59:49,542 --> 00:59:51,892
You're running out
of time, Commander.

1157
00:59:51,936 --> 00:59:55,635
They're gonna shove a Mark 48 torpedo right up your ass.

1158
00:59:55,679 --> 00:59:57,202
We'll see.

1159
00:59:57,245 --> 00:59:59,291
10 seconds to stealth.

1160
00:59:59,334 --> 01:00:02,294
9... 8...7...

1161
01:00:02,337 --> 01:00:03,861
We have a firing solution, sir.

1162
01:00:03,904 --> 01:00:04,862
Very well.

1163
01:00:04,905 --> 01:00:06,298
Man: Ready?
Flood those tubes.

1164
01:00:06,341 --> 01:00:08,039
Fire torpedoes
three and four.

1165
01:00:08,082 --> 01:00:09,823
Aye, aye, sir.

1166
01:00:16,308 --> 01:00:17,875
Sir, we have stealth.

1167
01:00:17,918 --> 01:00:21,879
Very well, Mr. Allenson.

1168
01:00:21,922 --> 01:00:23,489
Captain, sonar contact.

1169
01:00:23,532 --> 01:00:25,839
Torpedoes.
They've launched torpedoes.

1170
01:00:25,883 --> 01:00:28,276
Sonar, conn. Range?

1171
01:00:28,320 --> 01:00:30,104
1,500 yards and closing, sir.

1172
01:00:30,148 --> 01:00:31,845
Set battle stations.

1173
01:00:31,889 --> 01:00:34,282
Right full rudder.
20-degree down bubble.

1174
01:00:34,326 --> 01:00:36,284
- All ahead full.
- Aye, aye, sir.

1175
01:00:36,328 --> 01:00:38,286
Right full rudder.
20-degree down bubble.

1176
01:00:38,330 --> 01:00:39,461
All ahead full.

1177
01:00:44,162 --> 01:00:47,905
Sonar,
estimated time of impact?

1178
01:00:47,948 --> 01:00:49,167
Sir, we've lost
contact again.

1179
01:00:49,210 --> 01:00:50,908
They've gone to stealth, sir.

1180
01:00:50,951 --> 01:00:53,258
Sonar, estimated time of impact based on last target bearing.

1181
01:00:53,301 --> 01:00:56,043
Sir, time of impact
estimated... 20 seconds.

1182
01:00:59,003 --> 01:01:00,918
Sonar, conn.
Torpedo range?

1183
01:01:00,961 --> 01:01:02,615
Range 200 yards and closing.

1184
01:01:02,659 --> 01:01:03,834
Launch starboard
countermeasure.

1185
01:01:03,877 --> 01:01:06,097
Aye, aye, sir.

1186
01:01:10,536 --> 01:01:11,842
Ever have that feeling
where every move

1187
01:01:11,885 --> 01:01:13,278
you make is the right one?

1188
01:01:13,321 --> 01:01:16,847
You mean like General Custer?

1189
01:01:16,890 --> 01:01:18,109
Rig for impact.

1190
01:01:26,857 --> 01:01:29,598
Number two torpedo.
Range 100 yards.

1191
01:01:29,642 --> 01:01:33,951
75 yards. 50 yards.

1192
01:01:41,915 --> 01:01:44,265
I think both torpedoes
missed, sir.

1193
01:01:44,309 --> 01:01:45,702
Evasive action.
Hard left rudder.

1194
01:01:45,745 --> 01:01:49,009
All ahead full.
Sonar, what do you see?

1195
01:01:49,053 --> 01:01:51,620
Negative, sir.
She's gone, Captain.

1196
01:01:53,057 --> 01:01:55,712
Mr. Gerard,
get me a firing solution.

1197
01:01:55,755 --> 01:01:57,278
Open torpedo doors
one and two.

1198
01:01:57,322 --> 01:01:58,497
Aye, aye, sir.

1199
01:01:58,540 --> 01:02:01,239
Captain,
if we counterattack and miss,

1200
01:02:01,282 --> 01:02:05,504
these men are not ready for a shoot-out with a trained crew.

1201
01:02:05,547 --> 01:02:08,507
We should use this time to get ourselves closer to our objectives

1202
01:02:08,550 --> 01:02:11,858
and further away
from the Florida.

1203
01:02:11,902 --> 01:02:14,426
What would you do, Doc?
Stand and fight?

1204
01:02:14,469 --> 01:02:15,470
High noon.

1205
01:02:15,514 --> 01:02:16,602
Meet 'em in the street
head on.

1206
01:02:16,645 --> 01:02:18,691
See who blinks, Commander.

1207
01:02:18,735 --> 01:02:21,738
Change course to 060.
All ahead full.

1208
01:02:21,781 --> 01:02:22,826
Aye, aye, sir.

1209
01:02:22,869 --> 01:02:25,132
Helmsman,
change course to 060.

1210
01:02:25,176 --> 01:02:26,133
All ahead full.

1211
01:02:26,177 --> 01:02:29,093
We'll see who blinks...
next time.

1212
01:02:32,531 --> 01:02:35,447
Sir, we're taking on water
in the aft torpedo room.

1213
01:02:37,318 --> 01:02:38,972
Garrett, get as many
men as you can

1214
01:02:39,016 --> 01:02:40,757
to the aft torpedo room.

1215
01:02:43,107 --> 01:02:44,325
Contact naval headquarters.

1216
01:02:44,369 --> 01:02:47,720
Tell them anyone comes
within five miles of us,

1217
01:02:47,764 --> 01:02:48,721
we will launch.

1218
01:02:48,765 --> 01:02:50,767
Aye, aye, sir.

1219
01:02:53,900 --> 01:02:56,816
Scared, Commander?

1220
01:02:56,860 --> 01:02:59,079
Tremble and shake.

1221
01:03:00,298 --> 01:03:01,865
Lock this man up.

1222
01:03:01,908 --> 01:03:04,737
Get your ass out of here.
Move.

1223
01:03:09,524 --> 01:03:12,789
Romano, Chang,
meet me at the torpedo room.

1224
01:03:12,832 --> 01:03:13,790
Now.

1225
01:03:16,923 --> 01:03:19,056
That's good.
Right here.

1226
01:03:19,099 --> 01:03:20,884
You killed a couple
of friends of mine.

1227
01:03:20,927 --> 01:03:22,711
They didn't leave me
much choice.

1228
01:03:22,755 --> 01:03:25,714
Neither will I.

1229
01:03:25,758 --> 01:03:27,716
You feel a headache
coming on?

1230
01:03:27,760 --> 01:03:28,761
Piersall:
Put it down, fool.

1231
01:03:34,114 --> 01:03:36,029
I don't like you.

1232
01:03:36,073 --> 01:03:39,946
Doc. Come on, man.

1233
01:03:41,295 --> 01:03:45,038
- Move.
- What's the plan, Doc?

1234
01:03:45,082 --> 01:03:47,084
Shoot everybody
that's not me.

1235
01:03:53,525 --> 01:03:56,876
[Indistinct chatter]

1236
01:03:56,920 --> 01:03:59,357
Mr.
President, the Floridafailed in its attempt

1237
01:03:59,400 --> 01:04:00,967
to destroy
the Montana, sir.

1238
01:04:01,011 --> 01:04:02,708
And Krieg has said if anybody else comes near him,

1239
01:04:02,751 --> 01:04:05,493
he'll launch.

1240
01:04:05,537 --> 01:04:07,278
What do you suggest, Admiral?

1241
01:04:07,321 --> 01:04:10,890
I think we should recall all forces except the Florida, sir.

1242
01:04:10,934 --> 01:04:12,892
I believe one vessel might be able to strike at the Montana

1243
01:04:12,936 --> 01:04:14,285
without being detected.

1244
01:04:14,328 --> 01:04:16,417
I agree.

1245
01:04:16,461 --> 01:04:18,767
But let's give ourselves
some breathing room here.

1246
01:04:18,811 --> 01:04:21,248
Contact Commander Krieg.

1247
01:04:21,292 --> 01:04:23,294
Tell him we'll transfer the money within the hour.

1248
01:04:23,337 --> 01:04:25,165
- Mr. President --
- Trust me.

1249
01:04:31,258 --> 01:04:33,695
[Indistinct chatter]

1250
01:04:33,739 --> 01:04:35,349
Sir, message
from Washington.

1251
01:04:40,093 --> 01:04:41,921
We're to continue
our pursuit of the Montana.

1252
01:04:41,965 --> 01:04:44,793
All other forces
are standing down.

1253
01:04:44,837 --> 01:04:46,926
It's just us, then?

1254
01:04:48,754 --> 01:04:49,929
Yeah.

1255
01:04:52,976 --> 01:04:56,414
Let's find them...
and kill them.

1256
01:05:03,073 --> 01:05:04,291
[Knocking on door]

1257
01:05:05,510 --> 01:05:06,903
See who it is.

1258
01:05:06,946 --> 01:05:11,168
It's me.
Dugan.

1259
01:05:11,211 --> 01:05:12,560
- Ugh!
- Look out!

1260
01:05:14,954 --> 01:05:16,913
- Get over--
- [gunshot]

1261
01:05:27,836 --> 01:05:28,968
[gunshots]

1262
01:05:29,012 --> 01:05:30,752
[gasps]

1263
01:05:34,931 --> 01:05:36,019
Piersall, you know
how to work this?

1264
01:05:36,062 --> 01:05:37,020
What?

1265
01:05:37,063 --> 01:05:38,064
How do you work this?

1266
01:05:38,108 --> 01:05:39,065
I need
to shut it down now!

1267
01:05:39,109 --> 01:05:40,893
- Uh...
- Come on.

1268
01:05:40,937 --> 01:05:42,851
- Try the "off" switch.
- Come on, show me.

1269
01:05:42,895 --> 01:05:44,505
It's pretty easy
to turn off,

1270
01:05:44,549 --> 01:05:47,247
but it'll probably take about four hours to reboot.

1271
01:05:47,291 --> 01:05:49,510
- Do it.
- Uh...

1272
01:05:53,297 --> 01:05:55,864
- You got to be kidding me.
- [Alarm blaring]

1273
01:05:55,908 --> 01:05:57,475
Come on.

1274
01:05:57,518 --> 01:06:00,913
[Alarm continues]

1275
01:06:03,916 --> 01:06:06,701
Sir, we've lost the reactor.

1276
01:06:06,745 --> 01:06:08,921
Auxiliary power
is crossing over.

1277
01:06:08,965 --> 01:06:11,358
- Garrett!
- This is Garrett!

1278
01:06:11,402 --> 01:06:14,013
We're taking on a lot
of water here, Captain.

1279
01:06:14,057 --> 01:06:15,275
We lost the reactor.

1280
01:06:15,319 --> 01:06:16,624
Get up there,
find out what's wrong.

1281
01:06:16,668 --> 01:06:18,017
I'm on my way.

1282
01:06:18,061 --> 01:06:21,934
Get this fixed!
I'll be back.

1283
01:06:24,806 --> 01:06:27,853
Captain, I think it's time

1284
01:06:27,896 --> 01:06:31,030
we started to consider
some alternatives.

1285
01:06:31,074 --> 01:06:33,032
Surrender is not an option,
Mr. Allenson.

1286
01:06:33,076 --> 01:06:36,905
Captain, the diesel engines
will keep us moving forward,

1287
01:06:36,949 --> 01:06:38,255
but at a much slower
rate of speed,

1288
01:06:38,298 --> 01:06:39,996
but more importantly,

1289
01:06:40,039 --> 01:06:43,042
we can't go into stealth mode
without the reactor,

1290
01:06:43,086 --> 01:06:45,262
and the Floridais close by.

1291
01:06:45,305 --> 01:06:46,524
We can still
defend ourselves.

1292
01:06:46,567 --> 01:06:48,178
Not without
the torpedo room.

1293
01:06:51,529 --> 01:06:53,705
Contact naval headquarters.

1294
01:06:53,748 --> 01:06:55,011
We're moving
the deadline up.

1295
01:06:55,054 --> 01:06:57,883
Aye, aye, sir.

1296
01:06:57,926 --> 01:06:59,711
It's what we're doing.

1297
01:06:59,754 --> 01:07:01,713
It's what we're doing...

1298
01:07:01,756 --> 01:07:03,976
moving the deadline up.

1299
01:07:12,898 --> 01:07:15,857
Got it?
Give me your hand.

1300
01:07:15,901 --> 01:07:18,077
[Gasps]

1301
01:07:18,121 --> 01:07:21,646
[panting]

1302
01:07:21,689 --> 01:07:22,995
Can you make it,
Piersall?

1303
01:07:23,039 --> 01:07:25,084
- Do I have a choice?
- No.

1304
01:07:25,128 --> 01:07:25,867
[Sighs]

1305
01:07:25,911 --> 01:07:27,956
Get your weapon.
Come on.

1306
01:07:42,319 --> 01:07:44,538
Conn, reactor room.

1307
01:07:47,237 --> 01:07:48,542
This is the captain.

1308
01:07:48,586 --> 01:07:51,676
They've been here
and shut down the reactor.

1309
01:07:51,719 --> 01:07:53,547
And they killed
three of my men.

1310
01:07:53,591 --> 01:07:56,898
Well-- It will take hours
to have it running again.

1311
01:07:56,942 --> 01:07:59,075
Romano:
Conn, torpedo room.

1312
01:07:59,118 --> 01:08:01,555
Stand by.

1313
01:08:01,599 --> 01:08:03,775
Captain, we're still
taking on water down here!

1314
01:08:03,818 --> 01:08:05,298
Can you fix it?

1315
01:08:05,342 --> 01:08:09,085
I don't know, sir!
It doesn't look good!

1316
01:08:09,128 --> 01:08:10,086
How many are there with you?

1317
01:08:10,129 --> 01:08:10,999
I got three down here.

1318
01:08:13,306 --> 01:08:14,916
Okay, pick one,
get back here,

1319
01:08:14,960 --> 01:08:16,483
and seal off
the torpedo room.

1320
01:08:16,527 --> 01:08:18,442
Sir, if I seal
this compartment,

1321
01:08:18,485 --> 01:08:20,270
these people might not
get out of here alive.

1322
01:08:20,313 --> 01:08:23,664
It will serve as incentive.
That is all.

1323
01:08:23,708 --> 01:08:25,840
Aye, aye, sir.

1324
01:08:25,884 --> 01:08:27,973
Chang, come on!

1325
01:08:38,897 --> 01:08:41,856
Captain.

1326
01:08:41,900 --> 01:08:44,859
Washington has agreed
to your demands.

1327
01:08:44,903 --> 01:08:47,993
I'll send instructions
as to how we want this done.

1328
01:08:51,736 --> 01:08:54,695
Mr.
President, there's a communication patch for you from the Montana.

1329
01:08:54,739 --> 01:08:55,740
It's Krieg.

1330
01:08:57,220 --> 01:08:58,830
Put him on.

1331
01:08:58,873 --> 01:09:00,223
This is President Taylor.

1332
01:09:00,266 --> 01:09:02,268
Thank you for taking my call,
Mr. President.

1333
01:09:02,312 --> 01:09:05,184
I can't help
but feel... flattered.

1334
01:09:05,228 --> 01:09:07,230
What can I do for you,
Krieg?

1335
01:09:07,273 --> 01:09:09,841
I am still in charge
of this naval submarine,

1336
01:09:09,884 --> 01:09:11,625
and you will
address me as such.

1337
01:09:11,669 --> 01:09:14,889
And I'm still
President of the United States,

1338
01:09:14,933 --> 01:09:16,674
so let's get to the point,
shall we, Krieg?

1339
01:09:16,717 --> 01:09:19,111
The man was elected
for a reason.

1340
01:09:21,722 --> 01:09:23,681
I understand you're willing
to meet my demands.

1341
01:09:23,724 --> 01:09:26,249
If you mean pay your extortion, then, yes,
we are.

1342
01:09:26,292 --> 01:09:29,861
That's very kind of you,
Mr. President.

1343
01:09:29,904 --> 01:09:30,862
Thank you very much.

1344
01:09:30,905 --> 01:09:33,691
I feel I owe you this.

1345
01:09:33,734 --> 01:09:36,041
I want you to know
why I'm doing this.

1346
01:09:38,304 --> 01:09:41,481
At first,
I was a little angry about being passed over

1347
01:09:41,525 --> 01:09:46,269
time and time and time again
for command of my own sub,

1348
01:09:46,312 --> 01:09:48,749
something I richly deserve.

1349
01:09:50,098 --> 01:09:52,579
Hell, I was gonna be the best captain of the U.S. Navy.

1350
01:09:52,623 --> 01:09:55,452
I wanted the stature,

1351
01:09:55,495 --> 01:09:56,975
the respect.

1352
01:09:57,018 --> 01:09:59,064
But that didn't happen.

1353
01:09:59,107 --> 01:10:03,851
But now, Mr. President,
I am very, very angry.

1354
01:10:03,895 --> 01:10:05,244
Angry about what?

1355
01:10:05,288 --> 01:10:06,550
Your policies.

1356
01:10:06,593 --> 01:10:08,247
Your predecessor's policies.

1357
01:10:08,291 --> 01:10:09,683
They're all the same--

1358
01:10:09,727 --> 01:10:10,989
Negotiating with terrorists

1359
01:10:11,032 --> 01:10:12,860
when you should be
eradicating them.

1360
01:10:12,904 --> 01:10:14,079
Krieg--

1361
01:10:14,122 --> 01:10:15,559
Mr. President,

1362
01:10:15,602 --> 01:10:16,995
people will want to know
what happened here.

1363
01:10:17,038 --> 01:10:18,953
They'll want to know
what went wrong.

1364
01:10:21,739 --> 01:10:23,044
They'll blame me, of course.

1365
01:10:24,959 --> 01:10:27,266
By now, you know
that I'm dying,

1366
01:10:27,310 --> 01:10:28,702
and knowing that,

1367
01:10:28,746 --> 01:10:33,272
you know that for me,
it was never about the money.

1368
01:10:33,316 --> 01:10:35,883
It was always about saving
our great country.

1369
01:10:35,927 --> 01:10:39,278
It was always
about saving America.

1370
01:10:39,322 --> 01:10:40,671
Saving America?

1371
01:10:40,714 --> 01:10:41,976
Somebody's got to.

1372
01:10:42,020 --> 01:10:43,021
You're sure as hell
not doing it.

1373
01:10:43,064 --> 01:10:46,329
That is all.

1374
01:10:46,372 --> 01:10:47,939
[Groans]

1375
01:10:51,508 --> 01:10:55,076
[sighs]

1376
01:10:55,120 --> 01:10:57,296
People will want to know
what happened here.

1377
01:10:57,340 --> 01:10:59,907
It falls to you, Mr. Allenson,
and you, Mr. Gerard,

1378
01:10:59,951 --> 01:11:02,083
to make it clear.

1379
01:11:02,127 --> 01:11:04,085
- Aye, aye, sir.
- Aye, sir.

1380
01:11:06,740 --> 01:11:09,917
Mr. Allenson,
take these keys,

1381
01:11:09,961 --> 01:11:11,092
go to the launch control...

1382
01:11:11,136 --> 01:11:13,269
be ready.

1383
01:11:13,312 --> 01:11:15,836
But, sir,
we got what we wanted.

1384
01:11:15,880 --> 01:11:17,055
They're sending us the money.

1385
01:11:17,098 --> 01:11:19,927
I gave you an order,
Mr. Allenson.

1386
01:11:22,974 --> 01:11:23,975
Yes, sir.

1387
01:11:28,719 --> 01:11:32,331
Mr. Gerard... stand by.

1388
01:11:32,375 --> 01:11:34,768
Prepare to launch.

1389
01:11:34,812 --> 01:11:36,292
Yes, sir.

1390
01:11:41,906 --> 01:11:45,518
[Beeping]

1391
01:11:53,700 --> 01:11:56,877
[alarm blaring]

1392
01:12:04,929 --> 01:12:07,845
Sir, we have sonar contact
bearing 309.

1393
01:12:07,888 --> 01:12:09,325
Range--
just over five miles.

1394
01:12:09,368 --> 01:12:10,369
Can you identify?

1395
01:12:10,413 --> 01:12:12,545
Yes, sir.
It's the Montana.

1396
01:12:12,589 --> 01:12:13,590
He's not running stealth.

1397
01:12:13,633 --> 01:12:14,982
Set battle stations.

1398
01:12:15,026 --> 01:12:16,680
Battle stations,
battle stations.

1399
01:12:16,723 --> 01:12:19,030
All hands,
man your battle stations.

1400
01:12:24,731 --> 01:12:25,950
Krieg on headset:
Mr. Allenson.

1401
01:12:27,212 --> 01:12:28,169
Sir.

1402
01:12:28,213 --> 01:12:32,739
Firing order will be
missiles 6, 9,

1403
01:12:32,783 --> 01:12:38,528
11, 15, 18, and 21.

1404
01:12:38,571 --> 01:12:39,833
Aye, aye, sir.

1405
01:12:39,877 --> 01:12:47,928
Firing order's 6, 9, 11,
15, 18, and 21.

1406
01:12:47,972 --> 01:12:50,931
Target packages
are as follows:

1407
01:12:50,975 --> 01:12:54,674
Washington, D.C...

1408
01:12:54,718 --> 01:12:58,852
Pyongyang, North Korea...

1409
01:12:58,896 --> 01:13:00,419
and Tehran, Iran.

1410
01:13:00,463 --> 01:13:03,857
Sir, I'm entering
target packages.

1411
01:13:03,901 --> 01:13:06,294
Washington, D.C...

1412
01:13:06,338 --> 01:13:08,862
Tehran, Iran...

1413
01:13:08,906 --> 01:13:10,995
Pyongyang, North Korea.

1414
01:13:12,344 --> 01:13:13,954
I hear doubt in your voice,
Mr. Allenson.

1415
01:13:16,304 --> 01:13:17,828
Sir, I'm just
a little confused.

1416
01:13:17,871 --> 01:13:20,091
Our objective was to ransom
the city of Washington, D.C.

1417
01:13:22,485 --> 01:13:24,878
Nothing changed, Allenson.

1418
01:13:24,922 --> 01:13:26,576
If we get what we want,
all is well.

1419
01:13:26,619 --> 01:13:29,274
If, however,
we are deceived,

1420
01:13:29,317 --> 01:13:34,018
I will indulge myself
in a bit of mass destruction.

1421
01:13:34,061 --> 01:13:36,586
My God.

1422
01:13:36,629 --> 01:13:38,675
- Mr. Garrett.
- Here.

1423
01:13:38,718 --> 01:13:40,851
Report to the conn ASAP.

1424
01:13:40,894 --> 01:13:41,852
On my way.

1425
01:13:41,895 --> 01:13:43,462
Sonar, range?

1426
01:13:43,506 --> 01:13:45,464
Sir, target bearing 320.

1427
01:13:45,508 --> 01:13:46,857
Range--
five miles and closing.

1428
01:13:46,900 --> 01:13:49,207
Commander Michaels,
I need a firing solution.

1429
01:13:49,250 --> 01:13:50,208
Aye, aye, sir.

1430
01:13:50,251 --> 01:13:52,471
Man:
Noted, target zig.

1431
01:13:52,515 --> 01:13:53,733
Man 2: Noted.

1432
01:13:55,953 --> 01:14:00,044
Man, when this is over,
I'm gonna kick your ass, man.

1433
01:14:00,087 --> 01:14:01,306
You do that.

1434
01:14:02,525 --> 01:14:03,743
Garrett:
Captain.

1435
01:14:03,787 --> 01:14:06,311
- Conn, sonar.
- Stand by, Mr. Garrett.

1436
01:14:07,965 --> 01:14:08,922
This is the captain.

1437
01:14:08,966 --> 01:14:11,708
Sir, I have
a contact bearing 285.

1438
01:14:11,751 --> 01:14:13,405
Range-- three miles, sir.

1439
01:14:13,449 --> 01:14:15,059
Identify contact.

1440
01:14:15,102 --> 01:14:16,408
Sir, it's a sub.

1441
01:14:16,452 --> 01:14:18,497
Sound patterns
match the Florida.

1442
01:14:21,326 --> 01:14:23,110
- Mr. Allenson.
- Captain?

1443
01:14:23,154 --> 01:14:24,982
Begin launch sequence.

1444
01:14:25,025 --> 01:14:27,288
Captain,
there is still time.

1445
01:14:27,332 --> 01:14:29,377
- I gave you an order.
- Captain--

1446
01:14:29,421 --> 01:14:31,554
They will destroy us
if the sonar shows

1447
01:14:31,597 --> 01:14:32,816
we're not
preparing to launch.

1448
01:14:32,859 --> 01:14:34,078
Do you understand?

1449
01:14:34,121 --> 01:14:35,688
Open those launch tubes now.

1450
01:14:35,732 --> 01:14:39,823
Sir. Beginning
launch sequence.

1451
01:14:39,866 --> 01:14:42,303
[Alarm beeping]

1452
01:14:42,347 --> 01:14:44,262
[alarm blaring]

1453
01:14:44,305 --> 01:14:46,873
Mr.
Gerard, send a message to the Florida.

1454
01:14:46,917 --> 01:14:49,876
Tell them if they do not stand down,
we will launch missiles.

1455
01:14:49,920 --> 01:14:50,921
Aye, aye, sir.

1456
01:14:58,319 --> 01:15:01,497
Oh, my God.

1457
01:15:01,540 --> 01:15:03,107
He's gonna launch.

1458
01:15:06,980 --> 01:15:08,678
Sonar, range?

1459
01:15:08,721 --> 01:15:10,506
Sir, four miles.

1460
01:15:10,549 --> 01:15:11,855
Commander, I want that firing solution!

1461
01:15:11,898 --> 01:15:12,856
I want it now!

1462
01:15:12,899 --> 01:15:14,031
We're working on it, sir.

1463
01:15:14,074 --> 01:15:15,728
Message from
the Montana, sir.

1464
01:15:16,903 --> 01:15:18,992
"Unless you stand down,
we will launch."

1465
01:15:20,907 --> 01:15:22,474
Flood torpedo tubes
one and two.

1466
01:15:22,518 --> 01:15:24,041
Aye, aye, sir.

1467
01:15:24,084 --> 01:15:25,956
Get me a direct line
to the President.

1468
01:15:25,999 --> 01:15:27,479
We're doing
everything we can.

1469
01:15:27,523 --> 01:15:29,046
I've got the Florida
on the line, sir.

1470
01:15:29,089 --> 01:15:30,874
I'll have to call you back.

1471
01:15:30,917 --> 01:15:32,049
Put him on.

1472
01:15:32,092 --> 01:15:33,398
Go ahead, Captain.

1473
01:15:33,441 --> 01:15:35,879
Mr. President,
we've located the Montana.

1474
01:15:35,922 --> 01:15:37,576
We're ready
to fire torpedoes.

1475
01:15:37,620 --> 01:15:39,883
They're threatening to launch
unless we stand down.

1476
01:15:39,926 --> 01:15:44,017
Sir, I need to know
what you want us to do.

1477
01:15:44,061 --> 01:15:46,846
Captain Richards,
Krieg is out of his mind,

1478
01:15:46,890 --> 01:15:48,674
and he's going to launch
no matter what.

1479
01:15:48,718 --> 01:15:49,849
So fire when
you're in range, Captain.

1480
01:15:49,893 --> 01:15:51,938
Yes, sir.

1481
01:16:03,515 --> 01:16:04,864
Launch tubes are open.

1482
01:16:16,528 --> 01:16:17,921
Wait here.

1483
01:16:28,322 --> 01:16:29,323
Clear.

1484
01:16:32,936 --> 01:16:34,677
You post up here.

1485
01:16:34,720 --> 01:16:36,548
Anyone comes through,
you tag 'em.

1486
01:16:36,592 --> 01:16:39,986
Uh, Doc,
when they do the movie,

1487
01:16:40,030 --> 01:16:41,901
are we gonna die at the end?

1488
01:16:41,945 --> 01:16:44,034
Are you crazy?

1489
01:16:44,077 --> 01:16:47,037
No one kills
Denzel Washington.

1490
01:16:47,080 --> 01:16:48,821
Yeah, I guess you're right.

1491
01:16:48,865 --> 01:16:50,823
I mean, it's Denzel, man.

1492
01:16:50,867 --> 01:16:52,869
People aren't gonna
stand for that, right?

1493
01:17:04,750 --> 01:17:05,969
Sonar, range?

1494
01:17:06,012 --> 01:17:07,535
Three miles and closing, sir.

1495
01:17:07,579 --> 01:17:08,667
[Indistinct chatter]

1496
01:17:11,104 --> 01:17:12,976
Allenson,
how soon to launch?

1497
01:17:13,019 --> 01:17:14,978
Allenson:
Sir, if we continue,

1498
01:17:15,021 --> 01:17:16,283
there is no way
that we can--

1499
01:17:16,327 --> 01:17:18,677
Mr. Allenson,
how soon to launch?

1500
01:17:22,333 --> 01:17:24,074
Three minutes, sir.

1501
01:17:24,117 --> 01:17:26,467
Initiate launch.

1502
01:17:26,511 --> 01:17:30,907
Fire missiles 6, 9, 11,
15, 18, and 21.

1503
01:17:30,950 --> 01:17:38,044
Sir, confirm missiles
6, 9, 11, 15, 18, and 21.

1504
01:17:38,088 --> 01:17:40,046
- Mr. Gerard.
- Sir.

1505
01:17:40,090 --> 01:17:42,092
Engage.

1506
01:17:43,746 --> 01:17:45,617
Gerard!

1507
01:17:50,927 --> 01:17:52,798
- [Hammer clicking]
- Out of bullets, Doc?

1508
01:17:54,757 --> 01:17:56,323
I'll see you in hell, Doc.

1509
01:17:58,064 --> 01:18:01,111
[Groans]

1510
01:18:29,922 --> 01:18:30,923
Oh, no.

1511
01:18:44,937 --> 01:18:46,809
Oh, come on.

1512
01:18:50,073 --> 01:18:51,857
Captain, missile launch
from the Montana.

1513
01:18:51,901 --> 01:18:53,206
Fire one.

1514
01:18:53,250 --> 01:18:54,251
Fire one.

1515
01:18:56,079 --> 01:18:57,950
- Fire two.
- Fire two.

1516
01:19:01,127 --> 01:19:02,912
Estimated time to impact?

1517
01:19:02,955 --> 01:19:04,261
One minute and counting, sir.

1518
01:19:17,013 --> 01:19:19,058
I need the code, Piersall.

1519
01:19:19,102 --> 01:19:20,886
I need the code book.

1520
01:19:29,112 --> 01:19:30,026
Come on.

1521
01:19:30,069 --> 01:19:32,071
Got it, got it.

1522
01:19:32,115 --> 01:19:36,859
Four Hotel Foxtrot
seven three Kilo Lima Romeo

1523

1524
01:19:48,784 --> 01:19:50,698
Whoo! My man!

1525
01:19:50,742 --> 01:19:53,832
[Alarm beeping]

1526
01:19:53,876 --> 01:19:55,791
Doc, we got torpedoes
approaching.

1527
01:19:55,834 --> 01:19:56,792
500 yards away.

1528
01:19:56,835 --> 01:19:58,184
Oh, you got
to be kidding me.

1529
01:19:58,228 --> 01:20:00,404
Okay, take the helm.
Crash dive.

1530
01:20:00,447 --> 01:20:02,536
Take her down
as steep as she'll go.

1531
01:20:07,933 --> 01:20:09,630
Launching
all countermeasures.

1532
01:20:16,942 --> 01:20:19,684
This is the USS Montana.
Launch aborted.

1533
01:20:19,727 --> 01:20:22,469
Sub is secured.
Commander Krieg is dead.

1534
01:20:22,513 --> 01:20:25,516
Repeat, sub is secured,
launch aborted.

1535
01:20:39,922 --> 01:20:41,706
Bring her up nice and easy.

10-degree up bubble.

1537
01:20:43,316 --> 01:20:44,665
Steady as she goes.

1538
01:20:50,106 --> 01:20:51,194
Blowing ballast.

1539
01:21:01,944 --> 01:21:03,032
Man on phone:
I can reach you there?

1540
01:21:03,075 --> 01:21:04,685
I'll be here
till this is over, General.

1541
01:21:04,729 --> 01:21:05,686
Good.

1542
01:21:05,730 --> 01:21:07,036
I appreciate your concern.

1543
01:21:07,079 --> 01:21:08,472
Absolutely, Mr. President.

1544
01:21:08,515 --> 01:21:09,865
All right,
we'll talk later.

1545
01:21:09,908 --> 01:21:13,694
The Montana
has been secured, sir.

1546
01:21:13,738 --> 01:21:15,044
Oh, thank God.

1547
01:21:15,087 --> 01:21:16,872
And the two crew members
that were aboard?

1548
01:21:16,915 --> 01:21:18,047
Alive and well.

1549
01:21:18,090 --> 01:21:20,701
Well, when they reach land,
you just--

1550
01:21:20,745 --> 01:21:21,877
You bring them
to me, all right?

1551
01:21:21,920 --> 01:21:22,878
Will do.

1552
01:21:22,921 --> 01:21:24,488
Admiral Butler.

1553
01:21:24,531 --> 01:21:25,663
Yes, sir?

1554
01:21:25,706 --> 01:21:26,664
Good work.

1555
01:21:26,707 --> 01:21:28,709
And you, sir.

1556
01:21:28,753 --> 01:21:31,060
Damn good work,
if I may say so.

1557
01:21:39,938 --> 01:21:41,679
Ready to get off this sub?

[Chuckles]

1559
01:21:42,723 --> 01:21:44,073
Yeah, of course.

1560
01:21:45,726 --> 01:21:47,032
Thank you.

1561
01:21:47,076 --> 01:21:48,251
All right.

1562
01:21:48,294 --> 01:21:51,167
No. I mean it.

1563
01:21:51,210 --> 01:21:52,995
Thank you.

1564
01:21:55,040 --> 01:21:56,041
You're welcome, Doc.
