1
00:00:31,033 --> 00:00:34,133
Whoa!

2
00:00:35,233 --> 00:00:38,900
Yeah, Cleveland.

3
00:00:38,933 --> 00:00:40,900
What's up, Cleveland?
How you all feeling? Everybody good?

4
00:00:40,933 --> 00:00:42,933
Y'all good?
Everybody straight?

5
00:00:42,966 --> 00:00:45,500
Cold as shit out
this bitch, ain't it?

6
00:00:45,533 --> 00:00:48,166
I don't like that-
All this snow.

7
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:50,333
I don't like that shit.
Y'all got that slushy shit,

8
00:00:50,366 --> 00:00:53,000
that slipping snow.

9
00:00:53,033 --> 00:00:55,033
Hey, look-
God damn it.

10
00:00:55,066 --> 00:00:58,200
There's slush. There's slush right there.
Watch the slush.

11
00:00:58,233 --> 00:01:01,100
I don't like that shit. Y'all ain't
supposed to have snow out here.

12
00:01:01,133 --> 00:01:03,266
Good year for y'all though.
Right now got-

13
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:05,266
Before I even get started,
shouts out to-

14
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:07,500
Hey, sugar foot.
How you doing?

15
00:01:07,533 --> 00:01:10,000
How you doing, sweetie?
Get it out now.

16
00:01:10,033 --> 00:01:11,933
Before we get started,
shouts out to my man Shaq

17
00:01:11,966 --> 00:01:15,066
up front showing love.
The Cavs.

18
00:01:17,333 --> 00:01:19,300
My man LeBron in the house.

19
00:01:19,333 --> 00:01:21,033
Shout out to our boy
LeBron in the house.

20
00:01:23,466 --> 00:01:26,600
It's a good year for y'all.
A good year for y'all.

21
00:01:26,633 --> 00:01:30,400
Y'all might do it.
Y'all might do it.

22
00:01:30,466 --> 00:01:32,600
All right, y'all got me
up here for a while, all right?

23
00:01:32,633 --> 00:01:35,300
And this time-
About an hour.

24
00:01:35,333 --> 00:01:37,066
I'm gonna be up here
about an hour.

25
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:38,600
Now in this time y'all gonna
hear a lot of stuff.

26
00:01:38,633 --> 00:01:40,366
I'm not gonna lie to y'all.
Don't judge me.

27
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:43,100
I don't want nobody
judging me.

28
00:01:43,133 --> 00:01:44,833
I love to be honest
when I'm on stage.

29
00:01:44,866 --> 00:01:47,166
I talk about things that
I know- My family, my kids.

30
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,500
I love to talk
about my babies.

31
00:01:48,533 --> 00:01:50,333
Two babies-
Little boy and little girl.

32
00:01:50,366 --> 00:01:52,466
Now I used to talk about
my son being a dumb baby.

33
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:54,100
I used to.
I'm serious, I did.

34
00:01:54,133 --> 00:01:56,133
I thought my baby
was a dumb baby.

35
00:01:56,166 --> 00:01:59,166
But now I've realized he's not
dumb, he just does dumb shit.

36
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:02,200
Like, I don't like the way
my son throws his tantrums.

37
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:04,166
You know, when a baby
throws a tantrum

38
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:06,333
he's supposed to fall out,
cry, roll on the ground.

39
00:02:06,366 --> 00:02:08,566
That's a tantrum. This is
not a joke, this is for real.

40
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:10,533
This is what my son does
when he gets mad.

41
00:02:10,566 --> 00:02:12,933
I'm not lying.
Don't make me laugh. Look.

42
00:02:12,966 --> 00:02:15,300
This is what he do.
He goes...

43
00:02:17,066 --> 00:02:18,933
This is what he do.
He go...

44
00:02:22,533 --> 00:02:25,600
It's the most retarded thing
I've ever seen in my life.

45
00:02:25,633 --> 00:02:27,600
I can't say nothing.
I got to wait till he's finished

46
00:02:27,633 --> 00:02:29,800
then explain to people
what happened.

47
00:02:29,933 --> 00:02:32,966
He got an attitude
'cause he can't get no candy.

48
00:02:34,566 --> 00:02:36,333
My baby is weird, man.

49
00:02:36,366 --> 00:02:38,233
When he gets mad
he gets in the oven.

50
00:02:38,266 --> 00:02:40,566
I swear to God.
He gets in the oven.

51
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:42,833
Then get an attitude with me
when I get him out.

52
00:02:42,866 --> 00:02:45,300
Boy, get your ass
out of the damn oven.

53
00:02:46,966 --> 00:02:50,133
Get your ass out of the oven
before I turn it on.

54
00:02:50,166 --> 00:02:52,900
When I say that he go,
"hot. Hot.

55
00:02:52,933 --> 00:02:56,866
That thing hot, daddy. "

56
00:02:56,900 --> 00:02:58,433
I love him
to death though, man.

57
00:02:58,466 --> 00:03:00,600
Two- A little boy and little girl.
Now my daughter,

58
00:03:00,666 --> 00:03:03,066
is a different ballgame.
My daughter's spoiled, man.

59
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:04,600
About to be five.
Spoiled. I'm not gonna lie.

60
00:03:04,633 --> 00:03:06,233
I spoil her.
That's what I'm supposed to do.

61
00:03:06,266 --> 00:03:09,100
She's at that age now
though where she knows.

62
00:03:09,133 --> 00:03:12,100
She knows how to play me and her mom against
each other. She knows how to make us fight.

63
00:03:12,133 --> 00:03:14,000
Here's how she got me
in trouble the other day.

64
00:03:14,033 --> 00:03:16,300
She came in the room,
she hit me with the soft voice.

65
00:03:16,333 --> 00:03:17,933
She's like, "dad,
can I have a cookie?"

66
00:03:17,966 --> 00:03:19,866
I said, "yeah, baby.
Let's go get a cookie. "

67
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:21,366
I start walking
towards the kitchen.

68
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:23,266
Out of nowhere all I hear is,

69
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:26,166
"don't give her
no goddamn cookie!"

70
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:28,833
Scared the shit out of me.
I stopped.

71
00:03:28,866 --> 00:03:32,200
I didn't know what it was.
I thought it was Jesus at first.

72
00:03:32,266 --> 00:03:34,500
I went, "why can't she
have a cookie, Jesus?

73
00:03:34,533 --> 00:03:36,933
What did she do?"

74
00:03:36,966 --> 00:03:39,833
But here's how smart she is.
She knew how to get a reaction out of me.

75
00:03:39,866 --> 00:03:42,500
She looked at me. She said, "dad,
I thought you was the king of the house. "

76
00:03:42,533 --> 00:03:44,366
When she said that,
it set me off.

77
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,433
It riled me up.
So I snapped.

78
00:03:46,466 --> 00:03:49,433
I said, "what the fuck you mean
she can't have no goddamn cookie?

79
00:03:49,466 --> 00:03:52,266
Why'd you buy the cookies
if can't nobody eat a cookie?

80
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:54,933
That makes you stupid for
buying uneatable cookies.

81
00:03:54,966 --> 00:03:56,233
Ain't nobody
getting a cookie. "

82
00:03:56,266 --> 00:03:57,533
I shut the whole cookie
operation down.

83
00:03:57,566 --> 00:03:59,433
I grabbed the cookies,
got my ladder,

84
00:03:59,466 --> 00:04:02,500
put them on top of the refrigerator.
Then I hid my ladder.

85
00:04:02,566 --> 00:04:05,500
It wasn't a big ladder.

86
00:04:05,533 --> 00:04:07,466
Three steps.
It's a ladder for thugs.

87
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:09,533
Pap pap pap,
real quick.

88
00:04:09,566 --> 00:04:11,966
Little thug ladder.

89
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,833
This parenting thing is hard.
You need patience.

90
00:04:14,866 --> 00:04:16,500
Got to have a lot of patience
to deal with these kids.

91
00:04:16,533 --> 00:04:18,900
I'm not gonna lie,
I don't have a lot of patience.

92
00:04:18,933 --> 00:04:20,433
I'm learning.
I'm trying.

93
00:04:20,466 --> 00:04:22,400
Certain things make me mad.

94
00:04:22,433 --> 00:04:24,533
Like, I don't like it
when I tell my kids to do stuff

95
00:04:24,566 --> 00:04:26,366
and they do
exactly what I say.

96
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,066
I want you to do
what I say,

97
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:30,900
but I want you to do it how
I pictured you doing it.

98
00:04:31,033 --> 00:04:32,600
Don't do it the way
you want to do it.

99
00:04:32,633 --> 00:04:34,966
Do it the way I saw you doing it
when I told you to do it.

100
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,533
It might be confusing,
but this is serious to me.

101
00:04:37,566 --> 00:04:40,166
The other day my son,
he's suped up off candy.

102
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:42,333
He's running all over the house.
I got mad.

103
00:04:42,366 --> 00:04:44,200
"Hey, that's it.
Come here.

104
00:04:44,233 --> 00:04:46,100
Shut it down.
Go to bed. "

105
00:04:46,133 --> 00:04:48,000
Swear to God, this is what he did.
This made me so mad.

106
00:04:48,033 --> 00:04:49,333
Standing up,
this is what he did.

107
00:04:49,366 --> 00:04:51,333
I said, "go to bed. "
He said, "ah"

108
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:56,500
I was so mad.
"Wake your damn ass up.

109
00:04:56,533 --> 00:04:59,500
You don't sleep standing up.

110
00:04:59,533 --> 00:05:02,000
You're not no vampire. "

111
00:05:02,866 --> 00:05:05,566
I was mad 'cause I didn't know
how to explain why I was mad.

112
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:08,533
You don't close your eyes till
your brain tells your body

113
00:05:08,566 --> 00:05:10,966
to shut everything down.

114
00:05:14,266 --> 00:05:17,533
I got a lot of fears, man.
I got a lot of fears as a parent.

115
00:05:17,566 --> 00:05:19,500
Let me tell you guys
one of my biggest fears.

116
00:05:19,533 --> 00:05:22,933
One of my biggest fears is my
son growing up and being gay.

117
00:05:22,966 --> 00:05:25,566
That's a fear.
Keep in mind I'm not homophobic.

118
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:28,500
I have nothing against gay people.
Be happy, do what you wanna do.

119
00:05:28,533 --> 00:05:30,500
But me being
a heterosexual male,

120
00:05:30,566 --> 00:05:33,133
if I can prevent my son
from being gay, I will.

121
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:35,833
Now with that being said,
I don't know

122
00:05:35,866 --> 00:05:40,266
if I handled my son's
first gay moment correctly.

123
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:43,333
Every kid has a gay moment.
Okay? Every kid.

124
00:05:43,366 --> 00:05:45,200
But when it happens,
you've got to nip it in the bud.

125
00:05:45,233 --> 00:05:48,233
You got to stop it right then.
"Hey, stop! That's gay!"

126
00:05:48,266 --> 00:05:51,233
It's quick.
"No!"

127
00:05:51,266 --> 00:05:55,900
I don't know if I handled
my son's situation right.

128
00:05:55,933 --> 00:05:57,833
Okay? He's at
a birthday party, right?

129
00:05:57,866 --> 00:05:59,800
My son's at a birthday party,
he's playing.

130
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,266
You know when kids play,
they just play.

131
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:04,000
You don't know what they're doing
but they're having a good time.

132
00:06:04,033 --> 00:06:06,333
They're just doing
a bunch of stuff, right?

133
00:06:06,366 --> 00:06:08,866
They're moving around.
I said, "okay, he's good. "

134
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:11,566
I finished talking, I turn back around to
check on my son again,

135
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:16,166
a little boy was grinding
on my son's ass.

136
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:17,933
He was like this.
I didn't know what to do.

137
00:06:17,966 --> 00:06:20,366
I panicked.
I knocked them both down.

138
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:23,500
"Hey, what's going on here?
What kind of party is this?

139
00:06:23,533 --> 00:06:26,500
Huh? What kind
of party is this?

140
00:06:26,533 --> 00:06:29,300
What's going on here?"
This lady came out.

141
00:06:29,333 --> 00:06:31,900
She was like, "what are you doing?
They're kids, let them play. "

142
00:06:31,933 --> 00:06:35,833
I said, "you show me another kid
getting fucked in the ass and I'll calm down. "

143
00:06:35,866 --> 00:06:39,266
My son had on corduroys.
That's why I had attitude.

144
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:41,233
I didn't see it,
I heard it.

145
00:06:41,266 --> 00:06:43,300
All I heard was...
Brr brr brr.

146
00:06:43,333 --> 00:06:47,233
"What the? Who the hell
is playing with cards?

147
00:06:47,266 --> 00:06:50,833
What is that?
Is somebody shuffling cards?

148
00:06:50,866 --> 00:06:54,366
They're too young
for spades here. "

149
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:56,933
The thing
that pissed me off-

150
00:06:56,966 --> 00:06:58,933
Here's what
pissed me off, man.

151
00:06:58,966 --> 00:07:01,400
I was eating a buffalo wing
when it happened.

152
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:03,433
I should have dropped
the wing and ran over there,

153
00:07:03,466 --> 00:07:05,500
but I licked
my fingers first.

154
00:07:05,533 --> 00:07:07,533
I didn't mean it.
I said, "hey!

155
00:07:07,566 --> 00:07:10,366
Boy!"

156
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:13,266
The black in me came out.

157
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:15,333
There's a lot of pressure
dealing with kids, man.

158
00:07:15,366 --> 00:07:17,100
But I'm learning.
Here's one thing I've learned.

159
00:07:17,133 --> 00:07:19,033
Here's why my patience
is getting better.

160
00:07:19,066 --> 00:07:21,433
I've realized this:
My kids are gonna make mistakes.

161
00:07:21,466 --> 00:07:24,033
The reason why- When I was a kid
I made mistakes.

162
00:07:24,066 --> 00:07:25,966
I did a lot
of stupid stuff as a child.

163
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,100
My blood's in them.
They're gonna follow suit.

164
00:07:28,133 --> 00:07:30,700
With that being said,
I don't get as mad as I used to.

165
00:07:30,733 --> 00:07:33,566
I'm calming down. My daughter cursed for
the first time the other day.

166
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:35,933
I didn't get mad.
We was watching "SpongeBob. "

167
00:07:35,966 --> 00:07:37,533
Something happened
to Patrick.

168
00:07:37,566 --> 00:07:40,133
Out of nowhere she got mad.
She's like, "shit!"

169
00:07:40,166 --> 00:07:43,133
I said, "wait, what?
What did you say?"

170
00:07:43,166 --> 00:07:46,266
She's like, "shit! They got Patrick, dad.
You not watching?"

171
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:49,933
I said, "whoa.
All right. "

172
00:07:49,966 --> 00:07:52,333
Here's why I didn't
get an attitude.

173
00:07:52,366 --> 00:07:54,533
I'm gonna tell you why
I didn't get an attitude.

174
00:07:54,566 --> 00:07:57,000
I didn't give her attitude because
I remember my first time cussing.

175
00:07:57,033 --> 00:07:59,800
My first time cussing was 'cause my
mom smacked me in front of company.

176
00:08:00,233 --> 00:08:02,300
My friends was over my house.
I'm downstairs.

177
00:08:02,333 --> 00:08:04,033
We're playing,
we're having a good time.

178
00:08:04,066 --> 00:08:05,866
My mom comes downstairs,
she said, "hey.

179
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:07,933
I told you to keep it down.
You don't run this house,

180
00:08:07,966 --> 00:08:10,600
I do, okay?
With that being said, that's it.

181
00:08:10,633 --> 00:08:12,400
You're done.
Go to bed. "

182
00:08:12,433 --> 00:08:14,333
Smacked me.
Sent me up to my room.

183
00:08:14,366 --> 00:08:16,266
Now you know when you get smacked
when you're a kid

184
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:18,333
you get hyped
when you get by yourself.

185
00:08:18,366 --> 00:08:21,500
"You gonna smack me, bitch?

186
00:08:21,533 --> 00:08:23,866
In front of my friends?

187
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:26,500
You gonna smack me?!"

188
00:08:26,533 --> 00:08:31,000
I was emotional.
I was an emotional-ass kid.

189
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:34,033
"I'm running away!
That's it!"

190
00:08:34,066 --> 00:08:36,066
I packed a bag and everything.

191
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:38,533
You know how many times
I packed a bag with a toy?

192
00:08:38,566 --> 00:08:40,833
I packed a bag with one toy.

193
00:08:40,866 --> 00:08:42,500
"I'm out. I'm sick of it.

194
00:08:42,533 --> 00:08:45,566
Me and He-Man are out. "

195
00:08:48,166 --> 00:08:51,900
My mom gave me permission
to cuss one time.

196
00:08:51,933 --> 00:08:53,833
One time she gave me
permission to cuss.

197
00:08:53,866 --> 00:08:55,500
I'm in school,
I'm being bad.

198
00:08:55,533 --> 00:08:57,566
My teacher got mad.
Said, "Kevin, come here. "

199
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,933
Told me to come to the front of the class.
Wrote a note,

200
00:08:59,966 --> 00:09:01,866
stapled the note to my chest.

201
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:03,500
Said, "make sure your mother
reads the note. "

202
00:09:03,533 --> 00:09:05,233
I get home,
my mom reads the note.

203
00:09:05,266 --> 00:09:07,566
The note said, "maybe if
you showed your son

204
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:10,966
some more attention at home,
he wouldn't act like a fool in school. "

205
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,966
My mom read the note.
She said, "let me tell you something.

206
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,966
You tell her
mind her damn business

207
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,811
before I come down there
and I beat her ass. "

208
00:09:20,866 --> 00:09:23,466
I said, "okay. You want me
to say it like that?

209
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:25,233
Or do you want me
to take some stuff out?"

210
00:09:25,266 --> 00:09:29,233
"What I say? Tell her mind
her damn business

211
00:09:29,266 --> 00:09:31,833
before I come down there
and I beat her ass. "

212
00:09:31,866 --> 00:09:34,033
I said, "no, I heard what you said.
I just want to make sure

213
00:09:34,066 --> 00:09:36,200
that you know that you're telling me to say
the same thing. "

214
00:09:36,233 --> 00:09:38,900
"Kevin, if I tell you again I'm gonna smack
the shit out of you. "

215
00:09:38,933 --> 00:09:42,433
"Okay. No, I got it.
Okay, I got it.

216
00:09:42,466 --> 00:09:44,266
Okay, I got it.
No, I got it.

217
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:46,066
All right, okay. "

218
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:48,311
Keep in mind it's a lot
of pressure, all right?

219
00:09:48,366 --> 00:09:51,200
My mom just gave me permission to go
to school and cuss my teacher out.

220
00:09:51,233 --> 00:09:52,966
I didn't feel comfortable
with the situation.

221
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,833
So I wanted to practice.
I wanted to go upstairs,

222
00:09:54,866 --> 00:09:56,366
I wanted to go over my lines.

223
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:59,400
So I'm in the mirror,
I'm going over my lines.

224
00:09:59,433 --> 00:10:02,266
I'm like, "okay, all right.
Okay, all right. Okay.

225
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:05,933
My mom told me
to tell you

226
00:10:05,966 --> 00:10:07,500
to mind your damn-

227
00:10:07,533 --> 00:10:09,933
No, that's too loud.
That's way too loud.

228
00:10:09,966 --> 00:10:12,366
That's not believable.
It's too loud. "

229
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:14,533
Finally I go over it.
I get it down.

230
00:10:14,566 --> 00:10:17,466
I'm like, you know what?
I'm gonna go to bed early, get some rest.

231
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:19,311
'cause I got a big day
ahead of me tomorrow.

232
00:10:19,433 --> 00:10:21,566
I don't want
to mess this up.

233
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:24,333
So I go to bed.
I wake up, get dressed.

234
00:10:24,366 --> 00:10:26,600
Put on my pants and my shirt.
I get on the school bus.

235
00:10:26,633 --> 00:10:28,033
All my friends see me.
They get hyped.

236
00:10:28,066 --> 00:10:30,566
"Ooh, Kevin's on the bus.

237
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:33,366
Everybody look. Kevin's on the bus.
What up, Kev?"

238
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:35,566
I was like,
"yo, not today, y'all.

239
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:37,500
I got a lot of stuff
on my mind.

240
00:10:37,533 --> 00:10:40,066
I can't really have
y'all throwing me off. "

241
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:41,933
My friends was like,
"what are you talking about?"

242
00:10:41,966 --> 00:10:43,833
"I can't really get into it.
All I can tell y'all

243
00:10:43,866 --> 00:10:46,133
is that it's about
to go down. "

244
00:10:46,166 --> 00:10:48,398
He was like, "what?"
I said, "look, man.

245
00:10:48,433 --> 00:10:51,000
It's about to go down. Just be
behind me when I walk in class. "

246
00:10:51,033 --> 00:10:53,300
He said, "all right,
cool. " I walk in class,

247
00:10:53,333 --> 00:10:56,200
miss Green my teacher,
she starts speaking to everybody.

248
00:10:56,233 --> 00:10:59,266
"Hello. Good morning.
Good morning. Hello.

249
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:02,133
Hello. Good morning. "
She sees me, she was like,

250
00:11:02,166 --> 00:11:04,833
"Kevin. "
I said, "miss Green. "

251
00:11:04,866 --> 00:11:06,933
She said, "did you let
your mother read the note?"

252
00:11:06,966 --> 00:11:09,366
I said, "yes I did. "

253
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:11,866
She said, "well, what did
your mother say?"

254
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:13,833
I took a deep breath.
I looked at my friends.

255
00:11:13,866 --> 00:11:16,533
I was like,
"it's about to go down. "

256
00:11:16,566 --> 00:11:19,511
I said, "well...

257
00:11:20,266 --> 00:11:23,266
My mom told me to tell you

258
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:27,433
to mind your damn
motherfucking business, bitch.

259
00:11:27,466 --> 00:11:29,333
Little stupid bitch.

260
00:11:29,366 --> 00:11:31,500
Little dumb teacher bitch.

261
00:11:31,533 --> 00:11:34,933
2+2 not knowing what
the fuck it is bitch.

262
00:11:34,966 --> 00:11:39,033
Cross-eyed, crying down
your back fat foot ass bitch.

263
00:11:39,066 --> 00:11:42,466
Long tittied, no nipple
having ass bitch. "

264
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:45,333
The shit was crazy.

265
00:11:45,366 --> 00:11:47,911
My friends was in the back
and they was like, "oooh!

266
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:54,033
He said she ain't had
no nipples. "

267
00:11:55,466 --> 00:11:58,000
I got suspended.
I got suspended

268
00:11:58,033 --> 00:11:59,900
and an ass whipping.

269
00:11:59,933 --> 00:12:01,966
My mom beat the shit
out of me when I got home.

270
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,166
"I told you to say
two cuss words.

271
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:06,933
You said 76 of them. "

272
00:12:06,966 --> 00:12:09,333
I thought I was
Samuel L. Jackson.

273
00:12:09,366 --> 00:12:11,400
I'm sick and tired of these motherfucking
teachers in this motherfucking school.

274
00:12:11,433 --> 00:12:13,566
I had a trench coat on
and I flapped it.

275
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,600
You know when you flap it,
you got to get that air under it.

276
00:12:17,633 --> 00:12:20,111
Like fuck everybody in this
bitch. I don't give a shit.

277
00:12:20,166 --> 00:12:22,800
I'm a goddamn thug.

278
00:12:25,566 --> 00:12:28,133
You can't be so hard
on your kids, man.

279
00:12:28,166 --> 00:12:30,233
One of my friends
got a teenage daughter.

280
00:12:30,266 --> 00:12:32,866
He too strict.
I told him, "you got to relax.

281
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:35,066
That girl gonna do what she want to do
when you're not around anyway.

282
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:37,466
Relax, man. " He said, "Kev, let me
tell you something.

283
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:39,033
Do what you want to do
with your kids.

284
00:12:39,066 --> 00:12:40,400
Don't tell me how
to raise my kids. "

285
00:12:40,433 --> 00:12:42,166
I said, "you're right.
I apologize. "

286
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:45,066
Now this isn't funny,
but it made me laugh, okay?

287
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:48,533
He goes to his daughter's
phone and he finds a picture

288
00:12:48,566 --> 00:12:50,811
of a little boy's thing
on the phone. Right?

289
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:54,200
Now it's my friend, okay?
Tells me everything.

290
00:12:54,233 --> 00:12:57,233
It's not funny that he found a picture
of a little boy's thing on the phone.

291
00:12:57,266 --> 00:12:58,933
It was funny
the way he told me.

292
00:12:58,966 --> 00:13:00,933
He confides in me.
He tells me everything.

293
00:13:00,966 --> 00:13:03,266
He comes on the tour bus,
he mad as shit.

294
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:05,300
He says, "Kev, you're not gonna believe this.
I go through Tiffany's phone.

295
00:13:05,333 --> 00:13:08,266
I found a picture of a little
boy's, uh, situation

296
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:10,366
on the phone. "

297
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:12,133
I said, "what?
What?"

298
00:13:12,166 --> 00:13:14,133
"I found a picture
of the hot dog

299
00:13:14,166 --> 00:13:16,400
without the bun
on the phone. "

300
00:13:16,433 --> 00:13:19,811
"What are you talking-"
"A tallynackle. She had-

301
00:13:19,966 --> 00:13:23,300
It's a dick on the phone!
She got a dick on the phone!"

302
00:13:23,333 --> 00:13:26,600
I didn't know what to say
so I just kept repeating what he said.

303
00:13:26,633 --> 00:13:28,833
I said, "so you're telling me
he is a dick on the phone?"

304
00:13:28,866 --> 00:13:31,000
He said, "there's a dick
on the phone. "

305
00:13:31,033 --> 00:13:33,266
"So right now if I look in the phone
there's gonna be a dick in it?"

306
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:35,500
I said,
"well, what you gonna do?"

307
00:13:35,533 --> 00:13:37,133
He said, "what you think I'm gonna do?
I'm about to go to the school. "

308
00:13:37,166 --> 00:13:39,200
I said, "why you going
to the school?"

309
00:13:39,233 --> 00:13:41,500
He said, "why you think?
I'm about to find out whose dick it was.

310
00:13:41,533 --> 00:13:43,466
That's why I'm going
to the school. "

311
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:45,200
I said, "yo, I don't think
that's a good look.

312
00:13:45,233 --> 00:13:47,033
I don't think
you should do that.

313
00:13:47,066 --> 00:13:48,711
I don't think you should
go to the school with a picture

314
00:13:48,766 --> 00:13:50,466
of a little boy's dick
in the phone

315
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:52,900
and try to match it up
to other little boys.

316
00:13:52,933 --> 00:13:55,333
That's a little pedophile-ish,
don't you think?

317
00:13:55,366 --> 00:13:58,966
You'll be in jail before 3:00."

318
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,100
He said,
"well, what would you do?"

319
00:14:01,133 --> 00:14:03,266
By far the most difficult
question I've ever been asked in my life.

320
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:05,466
He said, "what would you do?"
I thought about it. I don't know.

321
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:08,166
I don't know what I would
do if I found a picture

322
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:10,100
of a little boy's thing on my daughter's phone.
I don't know what I'd do.

323
00:14:10,133 --> 00:14:12,833
I'd probably punch her in the throat.
I don't know.

324
00:14:12,866 --> 00:14:14,500
'cause I got a son too, okay?

325
00:14:14,533 --> 00:14:16,500
If I found out that my son is
pulling his thing out at school,

326
00:14:16,533 --> 00:14:18,811
when his mother's around
I'm gonna have an attitude.

327
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:20,400
I'm gonna have a lot
of stuff to say.

328
00:14:20,433 --> 00:14:25,033
"Really? Really, dude?
That's what you do at school?

329
00:14:25,066 --> 00:14:28,166
So you don't need pants
'cause your dick is out,

330
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:30,200
that's what
you're telling me?"

331
00:14:30,233 --> 00:14:32,233
As soon as his mom leaves-
"Hey, come here.

332
00:14:32,266 --> 00:14:34,466
What she say
when she saw it?

333
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:36,866
Give me some.
Give me some. Yes!

334
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:39,866
Hell yeah! Sometimes
you got to put it on the table, son.

335
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:42,466
Let 'em see it.
We small but we big

336
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:45,066
at the same time.
Let 'em know. "

337
00:14:46,966 --> 00:14:49,111
I'm a different type
of parent.

338
00:14:49,233 --> 00:14:52,000
I am a different
type of parent.

339
00:14:52,033 --> 00:14:55,300
I'm not gonna lie.
Certain things I do differently.

340
00:14:55,333 --> 00:14:57,200
I don't like babysitting.
I can admit that.

341
00:14:57,233 --> 00:14:58,533
I don't like watching
my kids by myself-

342
00:14:58,566 --> 00:15:00,433
Too much pressure.

343
00:15:00,466 --> 00:15:03,833
No man does. No man in this room
is a good babysitter.

344
00:15:03,866 --> 00:15:06,166
I can tell you how every man in this room
watches kids.

345
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:08,366
We sit on the couch

346
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:11,466
and listen for shit.

347
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:14,166
That's how we watch our kids. Kids do
whatever they want when they're with dad.

348
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:16,233
"Hey! Hey!

349
00:15:23,366 --> 00:15:26,266
I know y'all not in that toilet.

350
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:29,166
Y'all better not
be in that toilet!"

351
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:30,966
We ain't gonna do nothing.

352
00:15:34,533 --> 00:15:39,233
I definitely don't like watching other
people's kids. It's too much pressure.

353
00:15:39,266 --> 00:15:41,600
There's nothing worse than watching
somebody else's baby

354
00:15:41,633 --> 00:15:43,400
and you give them
their baby back in a condition

355
00:15:43,433 --> 00:15:45,500
that they didn't
give you their baby in.

356
00:15:45,733 --> 00:15:48,611
Like you ever have to explain something
before they see their baby?

357
00:15:48,666 --> 00:15:51,166
"Hey, real quick before
you look at your baby.

358
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:54,266
Uh, your baby had two eyes
for sure, right?

359
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:56,433
Okay, so it happened here.

360
00:15:57,566 --> 00:15:59,766
Long story short:
Gas went off in the kitchen,

361
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:01,500
blew the back
of your baby's face out.

362
00:16:01,533 --> 00:16:03,166
It was crazy. My baby knew what to do.
He got in the oven.

363
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:05,200
Your baby just stood there.

364
00:16:05,233 --> 00:16:08,133
Y'all don't run in your house?
Don't nobody run in your house?"

365
00:16:10,166 --> 00:16:12,000
I had one little girl
get hurt over at my house.

366
00:16:12,033 --> 00:16:14,400
Scariest thing ever, man.
One little girl, right?

367
00:16:14,433 --> 00:16:17,366
My daughter got
real big bunk beds.

368
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:19,111
I'm in the living room.
I'm watching TV.

369
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:21,066
Her and her friends,
they in the room playing.

370
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:23,000
Out of nowhere,
I hear a loud bang.

371
00:16:23,033 --> 00:16:25,066
Bang!
Little girl start crying.

372
00:16:29,266 --> 00:16:32,233
I come in the room,
the girls are standing around her.

373
00:16:32,266 --> 00:16:34,266
They all standing around her.
One girl is on her knee

374
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:37,133
looking at her face to face.
This is what almost made me laugh:

375
00:16:37,166 --> 00:16:40,300
When I came in the room,
the girl looked at me like "hm hm hm. "

376
00:16:40,333 --> 00:16:42,966
But I can't laugh
'cause I'm in daddy mode.

377
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,266
I've got to figure out what happened.
I go to my daughter.

378
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:46,866
It's her room.
She's responsible.

379
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:48,911
I said, "heaven, c'mere.
Come here.

380
00:16:48,966 --> 00:16:52,400
It's your room. You're responsible.
What happened?"

381
00:16:52,433 --> 00:16:55,200
It's very hard to take
a kid out of play mode.

382
00:16:55,233 --> 00:16:59,300
When kids are playing, they don't
know that shit just got real.

383
00:16:59,333 --> 00:17:03,300
They don't know. In her mind it's
still a game. I said, "what happened?"

384
00:17:03,333 --> 00:17:07,200
This is what my daughter did.
She said, "ho!

385
00:17:07,233 --> 00:17:09,033
Daddy!

386
00:17:09,066 --> 00:17:11,100
Daddy!"

387
00:17:11,133 --> 00:17:14,300
You ever see kids
do that shake shit?

388
00:17:14,333 --> 00:17:17,100
"What is wrong with-
Stop. Stop shaking your face.

389
00:17:17,133 --> 00:17:19,311
Stop.
What happened?"

390
00:17:19,333 --> 00:17:21,000
This is the story
my baby told me.

391
00:17:21,033 --> 00:17:23,233
She said,
"we got monsters, daddy.

392
00:17:23,266 --> 00:17:25,166
There's a bunch of monsters in here.
The prince came out,

393
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:26,600
told us to get in the castle.

394
00:17:26,633 --> 00:17:28,466
The castle was at the top
of the bunk bed.

395
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:30,933
We got up there, there was too many
people in the castle,

396
00:17:30,966 --> 00:17:32,933
so...

397
00:17:32,966 --> 00:17:36,066
Somebody had to go.

398
00:17:38,233 --> 00:17:40,233
We took a vote and she lost.
I kicked her off. "

399
00:17:40,266 --> 00:17:43,300
"Wait, what?
What?"

400
00:17:43,333 --> 00:17:45,466
"I kicked her off, dad.
It could've been anybody. "

401
00:17:47,466 --> 00:17:50,411
My baby made an executive decision.
I said, "all right.

402
00:17:50,466 --> 00:17:54,366
She had to go.
I get it. I understand. "

403
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:56,441
I'll tell you
another fear of mine.

404
00:17:56,533 --> 00:17:58,366
Here's another fear of mine.

405
00:17:58,709 --> 00:18:01,375
My biggest fear
is getting knocked out

406
00:18:01,409 --> 00:18:05,109
in front of my babies.
That's a fear, man!

407
00:18:05,142 --> 00:18:08,342
As a dad, what do you do? What do you
do when your kids come get you?

408
00:18:08,375 --> 00:18:11,642
"Dad, they messin' with me?"
"Who?" "Them!"

409
00:18:11,675 --> 00:18:15,109
As a dad, you gotta go
whip whoever them's ass is.

410
00:18:15,142 --> 00:18:17,242
That's your job as a dad.
What do you do

411
00:18:17,275 --> 00:18:19,375
when you go down there
and get your ass whipped?

412
00:18:19,409 --> 00:18:22,009
What do you say?
What do you say to your kids?

413
00:18:22,042 --> 00:18:24,942
"Dad, they messin' with me?"
"Who?" "Them!"

414
00:18:24,975 --> 00:18:27,241
"Stay right here.
Hey, motherf-

415
00:18:29,442 --> 00:18:31,742
Come on, come on!
Let's go!

416
00:18:31,775 --> 00:18:34,809
These niggas are real!
Let's go!

417
00:18:34,842 --> 00:18:36,875
Hurry up!
Get in the car!

418
00:18:38,342 --> 00:18:41,109
Was that a kid?
Was that a kid?

419
00:18:41,142 --> 00:18:43,409
When we get home,
I'm whippin' your ass

420
00:18:43,442 --> 00:18:45,642
for putting me
in that situation.

421
00:18:45,675 --> 00:18:47,975
I had nothing
to do with that.

422
00:18:48,009 --> 00:18:50,342
I woke up this morning
as a Christian.

423
00:18:50,375 --> 00:18:52,342
You don't do that to me. "

424
00:18:57,209 --> 00:18:59,209
It's a different ballgame.

425
00:19:01,809 --> 00:19:04,175
See, me? I'm gonna be honest
with you guys, man.

426
00:19:04,209 --> 00:19:07,009
I'm not that guy.
I'm not a fighter, man.

427
00:19:07,042 --> 00:19:09,642
I'm not.
I won't act like I am.

428
00:19:09,675 --> 00:19:12,409
I won't. Seen too many
bad things happen.

429
00:19:12,442 --> 00:19:14,842
I saw my dad
get knocked out one time.

430
00:19:14,875 --> 00:19:17,275
I was 13.
It traumatized me.

431
00:19:17,309 --> 00:19:19,709
This guy hit my dad
twice in the same spot-

432
00:19:19,742 --> 00:19:23,342
Quick as hell. Quickest two punches
I've ever seen in my life.

433
00:19:23,375 --> 00:19:25,541
I've never seen anything like it.
Hit my dad so fast

434
00:19:25,775 --> 00:19:29,042
in the middle of the fight my dad
stopped and asked me what happened.

435
00:19:29,075 --> 00:19:32,042
In the middle of the fight.
He's like, "shit! Hey!

436
00:19:32,075 --> 00:19:35,875
Kevin, hey!
He just hit me twice?"

437
00:19:35,909 --> 00:19:37,875
"Yes.
Yes he did. "

438
00:19:37,909 --> 00:19:40,042
"Are you sure it was him?"

439
00:19:40,075 --> 00:19:41,975
"It's only y'all
two out here, dad.

440
00:19:42,009 --> 00:19:43,309
Ain't nobody else
out here with y'all. "

441
00:19:43,342 --> 00:19:45,042
"So you telling me
he that fast?

442
00:19:45,075 --> 00:19:48,042
They not jumping me?
Ain't nobody jumping me?"

443
00:19:48,075 --> 00:19:50,309
"No, nobody jumping you.
It's just him. "

444
00:19:50,342 --> 00:19:54,209
"Well, he must be an octopus.
I saw a lot of stuff goin' by my face. "

445
00:19:54,242 --> 00:19:56,641
"Really? Really, dad?

446
00:19:56,975 --> 00:19:59,642
An octopus?
That's what you just fought?

447
00:20:00,175 --> 00:20:02,975
A human octopus?
Really?"

448
00:20:03,009 --> 00:20:05,342
When my dad called another
grown-ass man an octopus,

449
00:20:05,375 --> 00:20:08,109
that was the day he stopped
being my dad. I lost all respect.

450
00:20:08,142 --> 00:20:10,142
He didn't understand that.

451
00:20:10,175 --> 00:20:12,209
He was still trying
to discipline me.

452
00:20:12,242 --> 00:20:14,975
"Kevin! Hey! Didn't I tell you
to get the trash out?

453
00:20:15,009 --> 00:20:18,009
Get up, get the trash out
before I crack your damn face. "

454
00:20:18,042 --> 00:20:21,042
"Shut up. Shut up!
You get the trash out

455
00:20:21,075 --> 00:20:23,942
before I get Steve over here,
put his damn hands on you again. "

456
00:20:26,975 --> 00:20:29,242
"Oh, you gonna get Steve, huh?

457
00:20:29,275 --> 00:20:31,775
You are something else,
you know that?

458
00:20:31,809 --> 00:20:34,075
You are something else.
Give me the trash.

459
00:20:34,109 --> 00:20:36,709
I'll take the trash out.
Give me the trash. "

460
00:20:36,742 --> 00:20:38,675
He didn't want to see
Steve again.

461
00:20:38,709 --> 00:20:41,042
Steve beat the shit
out of my dad.

462
00:20:41,075 --> 00:20:44,142
You ever see somebody
lose a fight and talk like they won?

463
00:20:44,175 --> 00:20:46,775
That's my dad.
After he got knocked out,

464
00:20:46,809 --> 00:20:49,909
he's like, "you good?
Are you good now?"

465
00:20:49,942 --> 00:20:51,875
I said, "dad, I don't think
that's your lines.

466
00:20:51,909 --> 00:20:53,875
I think the winners
say that.

467
00:20:53,909 --> 00:20:55,541
I think the guy who won say that.

468
00:20:55,842 --> 00:20:57,675
You just lay down
for a second and let him

469
00:20:57,709 --> 00:20:59,909
finish his speech.
I think you got up too fast anyway.

470
00:20:59,942 --> 00:21:02,075
You gonna be dizzy. "

471
00:21:04,442 --> 00:21:06,809
When I saw my dad
get knocked out

472
00:21:06,842 --> 00:21:08,842
and I saw my brother
get knocked out,

473
00:21:08,875 --> 00:21:10,909
it made me feel like,
as a family,

474
00:21:10,942 --> 00:21:14,742
we're not good at this
particular activity.

475
00:21:14,775 --> 00:21:18,075
We're not fighters. We're readers.
We're good readers in my family.

476
00:21:18,109 --> 00:21:22,075
Here's why I don't fight: You don't know
what people are capable of now.

477
00:21:22,109 --> 00:21:24,109
Too many people know
too many different things.

478
00:21:24,142 --> 00:21:25,541
I'm serious.
Know what I'm scared of?

479
00:21:26,342 --> 00:21:28,809
U.F.C. Fighters.
You know why?

480
00:21:28,842 --> 00:21:31,042
Because they're real.

481
00:21:31,075 --> 00:21:33,142
That is not a game, people.
They are here.

482
00:21:33,175 --> 00:21:36,342
They exist.
They know shit.

483
00:21:36,375 --> 00:21:38,842
Touch a pressure point,
shuts your whole body down.

484
00:21:38,875 --> 00:21:42,309
Pow. "It's a wrap.
Can't move none of that. "

485
00:21:42,342 --> 00:21:44,342
"Fight back!"
"I can't.

486
00:21:44,375 --> 00:21:47,109
Everything is shut down.
I don't know what he did.

487
00:21:47,142 --> 00:21:49,009
Everything.
I can't move anything. "

488
00:21:51,142 --> 00:21:53,709
You know who gonna get
their asses beat by these guys?

489
00:21:53,742 --> 00:21:55,541
Thugs.
I'm gonna tell you why.

490
00:21:55,775 --> 00:21:58,075
Thugs, y'all don't know
how to just fight.

491
00:21:58,109 --> 00:22:00,342
Thugs always got to give you
a speech before they fight.

492
00:22:00,375 --> 00:22:02,275
You ever see how long
it take a thug to fight?

493
00:22:02,309 --> 00:22:04,709
Gotta give you his whole
background before he fight.

494
00:22:04,742 --> 00:22:07,342
It take too long.
"Yeah. Real niggas.

495
00:22:07,375 --> 00:22:09,942
All day. Just me.
By myself.

496
00:22:09,975 --> 00:22:11,775
On the block.
Holding it down.

497
00:22:11,809 --> 00:22:13,975
Gun at my waist.
Straight face.

498
00:22:14,009 --> 00:22:15,742
All day.
Not a game.

499
00:22:15,775 --> 00:22:17,642
In jail.
By myself!

500
00:22:17,675 --> 00:22:19,742
One bed.
No pillowcase.

501
00:22:19,775 --> 00:22:22,142
One pillow.
Didn't nobody write me.

502
00:22:22,175 --> 00:22:24,642
It was early. Woke up.
Went back to sleep.

503
00:22:24,675 --> 00:22:26,941
Took a nap.
You ever go night night, nigga?

504
00:22:27,042 --> 00:22:28,909
You ever
go night night, nigga?!

505
00:22:28,942 --> 00:22:31,142
Everybody goes
night night, nigga!"

506
00:22:31,175 --> 00:22:33,909
"What?

507
00:22:33,942 --> 00:22:35,675
What does this
have to do with the fight?

508
00:22:35,709 --> 00:22:38,175
Are we fighting or not?"
"You didn't write me. "

509
00:22:38,209 --> 00:22:40,775
"I don't know you. "

510
00:22:40,809 --> 00:22:44,975
These guys are gonna be
the ones, man.

511
00:22:45,009 --> 00:22:46,942
Everybody can't be a thug.

512
00:22:46,975 --> 00:22:49,742
Everybody cannot be a thug.

513
00:22:49,775 --> 00:22:51,742
I can't stand TV thugs.

514
00:22:51,775 --> 00:22:53,375
You know what a TV thug is?

515
00:22:53,409 --> 00:22:55,409
Those the guys
who do what they see on TV

516
00:22:55,442 --> 00:22:57,541
all day, every day.
All day, every day.

517
00:22:57,675 --> 00:23:00,342
You ever see those guys.
"Yeah, nig'. What, nig'?"

518
00:23:00,375 --> 00:23:03,009
You never seen the dancing thugs?
Get out the car...

519
00:23:05,109 --> 00:23:07,342
"It ain't a game.
You think it's a game around here?"

520
00:23:07,375 --> 00:23:09,409
I don't like those guys.

521
00:23:09,442 --> 00:23:11,709
I know real thugs.

522
00:23:11,742 --> 00:23:14,809
My uncle is a real thug.

523
00:23:14,842 --> 00:23:17,742
Certified.
Put a stamp on him.

524
00:23:17,775 --> 00:23:19,375
Locked up 15 years.

525
00:23:19,409 --> 00:23:21,642
Got out of jail,
ain't nothing changed.

526
00:23:21,675 --> 00:23:25,209
Very serious. When my uncle talk,
this is how he look.

527
00:23:25,242 --> 00:23:25,541
I don't care what he's talking about.
This is how he looks...

528
00:23:31,775 --> 00:23:34,042
I don't care what he's sayin'.

529
00:23:34,075 --> 00:23:37,375
"Put the goddamn jelly on the
motherfuckin' sandwich. Do it! Spread it!"

530
00:23:37,409 --> 00:23:40,342
He's crazy.
He's crazy.

531
00:23:40,375 --> 00:23:42,342
He's institutionalized, man.

532
00:23:44,142 --> 00:23:46,075
Understand when you've been
in jail 15 years,

533
00:23:46,109 --> 00:23:48,109
all you know is jail.

534
00:23:48,142 --> 00:23:50,142
Your mannerisms,
your language-

535
00:23:50,175 --> 00:23:52,675
You eat, sleep and think jail.

536
00:23:52,709 --> 00:23:55,342
Okay? Your threats
aren't even the same.

537
00:23:55,675 --> 00:23:58,841
When you threaten somebody,
they should know what's about to happen.

538
00:23:58,975 --> 00:24:00,709
It's a transition into a fight.

539
00:24:00,742 --> 00:24:02,375
"I'm sick of your ass.
Get up. "

540
00:24:02,409 --> 00:24:04,942
When they get up, they know
there's gonna be a fight.

541
00:24:04,975 --> 00:24:08,242
Stuff my uncle says
leaves you in suspense.

542
00:24:08,275 --> 00:24:11,075
They're like the worst jail metaphors
I've ever heard in my life.

543
00:24:11,109 --> 00:24:12,809
I don't even know
how to explain 'em.

544
00:24:12,842 --> 00:24:14,642
He gets out of jail,
my brother calls me.

545
00:24:14,675 --> 00:24:16,375
"Kevin, uncle Richard
just got home. "

546
00:24:16,409 --> 00:24:18,642
"I'm on the first flight.
I'll be there in the morning. "

547
00:24:18,675 --> 00:24:20,642
I ain't seen him in 15 years.
I got to see him.

548
00:24:20,675 --> 00:24:22,975
I get there, my uncle's in the middle
of the living room.

549
00:24:23,009 --> 00:24:25,175
I'm hyped to see him.
"Uncle Richard, what up, baby?

550
00:24:25,209 --> 00:24:27,641
15 years. That's a long time.
How you been?"

551
00:24:27,742 --> 00:24:29,342
I swear to God
this is what he said.

552
00:24:29,375 --> 00:24:31,942
"Say it with your chest,
little-ass nigga!"

553
00:24:42,275 --> 00:24:44,775
I didn't know what to say.
My brother grabbed me.

554
00:24:44,809 --> 00:24:46,909
He was like, "chill.
He's been saying this all day.

555
00:24:46,942 --> 00:24:49,209
We don't know what it means.
Wait till we figure it out. "

556
00:24:49,242 --> 00:24:51,842
Here's the thing, right?

557
00:24:51,875 --> 00:24:53,775
I said, "I'm not gonna chill.
I'm gonna talk to him.

558
00:24:53,809 --> 00:24:55,941
Y'all not talkin' to him. "
I pulled him to the side

559
00:24:56,009 --> 00:24:58,942
and said, "look, unc, a lot of stuff
has changed since you've been gone.

560
00:24:58,975 --> 00:25:00,909
I'm doing well.
I'm making good money.

561
00:25:00,942 --> 00:25:02,909
Let me take you out,
put you around some women,

562
00:25:02,942 --> 00:25:04,775
get some drinks.
We'll have a good time. "

563
00:25:04,809 --> 00:25:07,009
He said, "all right, cool. "
I take him to a lounge, right?

564
00:25:07,042 --> 00:25:09,342
I'm at the bar. I'm drinking.
There's women around me.

565
00:25:09,375 --> 00:25:11,709
I'm having a good time
I can't see him,

566
00:25:11,742 --> 00:25:13,809
but I can hear him.

567
00:25:13,842 --> 00:25:15,842
I can't see him,
but I can hear him.

568
00:25:15,875 --> 00:25:18,042
Out of nowhere
all I hear is

569
00:25:18,075 --> 00:25:20,175
"I'm sick of this motherfucker, man.

570
00:25:20,209 --> 00:25:22,975
Kev, pin the tail on his ass!"

571
00:25:25,375 --> 00:25:28,541
"Is it his birthday?
Why would I do that?

572
00:25:28,709 --> 00:25:30,742
W- why would I do that?
What do you mean?"

573
00:25:30,775 --> 00:25:33,375
"Peel this motherfucker's
muffin cap back blue. "

574
00:25:35,675 --> 00:25:38,009
"Is that drink?
That's probably a drink.

575
00:25:38,042 --> 00:25:40,109
Can I get a peel his
muffin cap back blue?"

576
00:25:40,142 --> 00:25:42,342
"Say it with your chest!"

577
00:25:42,375 --> 00:25:44,975
"Can I get a peel
his muffin cap-"

578
00:25:45,009 --> 00:25:48,842
I didn't know what to do.
I was confused.

579
00:25:48,875 --> 00:25:51,742
My family threw him
on me, man.

580
00:25:51,775 --> 00:25:53,742
They threw him on me.

581
00:25:53,775 --> 00:25:56,241
They said, "Kev, look, you're
making money. Give him a job.

582
00:25:56,309 --> 00:25:58,409
Give him a second chance at life. "
I said, "fine.

583
00:25:58,442 --> 00:26:00,409
I'm gonna
let him train me, okay?"

584
00:26:00,442 --> 00:26:02,875
I was about to go to Australia.
I was gonna film a movie.

585
00:26:02,909 --> 00:26:04,975
I wanted to get a little bigger.
Let him train me.

586
00:26:05,009 --> 00:26:07,909
Reason why?
My uncle had that jail body.

587
00:26:07,942 --> 00:26:12,142
Up top, solid.
Not a game. Rock hard.

588
00:26:12,175 --> 00:26:14,975
Didn't work
on his legs that much.

589
00:26:15,009 --> 00:26:17,875
Sometimes you could see him
struggling to keep the top half up-

590
00:26:17,909 --> 00:26:19,875
The stick legs.

591
00:26:23,942 --> 00:26:27,341
Looked like this nigga was
tip drilling all the time.

592
00:26:28,875 --> 00:26:31,675
"What are you doing, unc?
Why you keep shakin' your ass?

593
00:26:31,709 --> 00:26:34,309
What are you doing?
Relax your ass, man. "

594
00:26:34,342 --> 00:26:36,709
"I ain't shakin' it.
It's my legs. "

595
00:26:40,275 --> 00:26:43,975
Now for those of you who do not
understand the job of a personal trainer,

596
00:26:44,009 --> 00:26:45,809
I'll explain it to you.

597
00:26:45,842 --> 00:26:47,809
A personal trainer's job
is to do what?

598
00:26:47,842 --> 00:26:50,042
Motivate you, people,
make you feel

599
00:26:50,075 --> 00:26:52,309
like you could do things
you never thought you could do.

600
00:26:52,342 --> 00:26:55,042
Here's an example of
a personal trainer's conversation.

601
00:26:55,075 --> 00:26:57,241
"Come on, man.
You can do it.

602
00:26:57,775 --> 00:27:00,242
Push it.
You got it.

603
00:27:00,275 --> 00:27:02,409
Breathe.
Three more.

604
00:27:02,442 --> 00:27:05,209
Last two.
Get it up.

605
00:27:05,242 --> 00:27:07,642
Last one.
Good set.

606
00:27:07,675 --> 00:27:10,342
Go wipe off. "
That's a trainer conversation.

607
00:27:10,375 --> 00:27:13,009
Once again,
I didn't like the way

608
00:27:13,042 --> 00:27:15,309
that he talked to me, okay?

609
00:27:15,342 --> 00:27:17,842
We're at the gym. I'm on a weight bench.
I'm not gonna lie.

610
00:27:17,875 --> 00:27:19,409
I'm struggling.
I couldn't get it.

611
00:27:23,042 --> 00:27:24,609
I couldn't get it.
Out of nowhere,

612
00:27:24,642 --> 00:27:26,541
he came up behind me.
"Close your mouth

613
00:27:26,609 --> 00:27:28,775
before somebody come up,
put their dick in it on the yard. "

614
00:27:32,275 --> 00:27:34,409
"What'd he say?
What'd he just say?

615
00:27:34,442 --> 00:27:36,809
Somebody get the weights.
I just wanna ask him something.

616
00:27:36,842 --> 00:27:38,842
Somebody get the weights.
Let me ask him something.

617
00:27:38,875 --> 00:27:41,842
Uh, is that a dick out behind me for real
or is he just joking?

618
00:27:41,875 --> 00:27:44,342
No, if it is, that's gotta change.
Somebody's got to put that up.

619
00:27:44,375 --> 00:27:46,709
I'm not gonna work out
if that's gonna stay out.

620
00:27:46,742 --> 00:27:49,742
I pay my membership like everybody else.
I don't need to see that.

621
00:27:49,775 --> 00:27:52,709
Fix it. "

622
00:27:52,742 --> 00:27:55,009
That's when I stopped
messing with him.

623
00:27:55,042 --> 00:27:57,058
Hey, real quick.
This is not a joke.

624
00:27:57,075 --> 00:27:58,775
I just want to know
what you guys think.

625
00:27:58,809 --> 00:28:00,309
Be honest.
You don't gotta lie, okay?

626
00:28:00,342 --> 00:28:02,275
This is true.
It's me being honest.

627
00:28:02,309 --> 00:28:03,942
I'm opening up to y'all
for a second.

628
00:28:03,975 --> 00:28:07,075
Does this make me gay?
I was at the mall, right?

629
00:28:07,109 --> 00:28:10,809
Some guy saw me.
He was like, "oh, Kev Hart. What up, man?

630
00:28:10,842 --> 00:28:12,842
I'm a big fan.
I love you, dude.

631
00:28:12,875 --> 00:28:15,342
Funny as hell. Keep doing you, man.
Swear to God. Funny. "

632
00:28:15,375 --> 00:28:19,209
And I caught it.
Does that make me gay?

633
00:28:19,242 --> 00:28:21,775
Does that make me gay?

634
00:28:22,809 --> 00:28:25,042
Does it make me gay?

635
00:28:25,075 --> 00:28:28,058
I thought he was waving. Put yourself
in my shoes. I thought he was waving.

636
00:28:28,075 --> 00:28:30,009
By the time I realized
it wasn't a wave, it was too late.

637
00:28:30,042 --> 00:28:32,775
I was like, "hey, man.
No no no. I got it. Too late. Okay.

638
00:28:34,342 --> 00:28:36,809
It was weird. What do I do now?
I held it until he left

639
00:28:36,842 --> 00:28:38,342
and then I set it down.

640
00:28:38,375 --> 00:28:40,242
I didn't use it. I set it down.

641
00:28:40,275 --> 00:28:42,709
I swear to God. I'll tell you the truth.
I didn't use it.

642
00:28:42,742 --> 00:28:45,075
I didn't put it in my pocket.
I just set it down.

643
00:28:48,075 --> 00:28:50,042
I wanted to be like
my uncle for a minute.

644
00:28:50,075 --> 00:28:52,742
I did. This is me being
honest with you guys.

645
00:28:52,775 --> 00:28:55,042
Reason why? My uncle got
so much respect, man.

646
00:28:55,060 --> 00:28:57,243
People feared my uncle.
I was like I want that fear.

647
00:28:57,309 --> 00:29:00,975
Don't nobody fear me.
People think I'm a bitch.

648
00:29:01,009 --> 00:29:05,309
They do. My lady think I'm a bitch.
Call me a bitch all the time.

649
00:29:05,342 --> 00:29:07,642
"You a bitch!"
Right to my face.

650
00:29:08,075 --> 00:29:11,875
This is my answer:
"So? Now what? What happens now?"

651
00:29:11,975 --> 00:29:14,042
It's not that I'm a bitch.
I'm just smart.

652
00:29:14,075 --> 00:29:16,642
I don't put myself in situations
where I'm not gonna win.

653
00:29:16,675 --> 00:29:19,342
That don't make me a bitch.
Here's what really pisses me off:

654
00:29:19,375 --> 00:29:22,975
If I am a bitch,
that's our business.

655
00:29:23,009 --> 00:29:25,275
Don't nobody know me.
You don't know me, man.

656
00:29:25,309 --> 00:29:27,958
If me and you get into an argument,
it don't matter what I say,

657
00:29:28,009 --> 00:29:30,709
you got to believe me 'cause you
don't know what I'm capable of.

658
00:29:30,742 --> 00:29:33,375
Same thing vice-versa.
Only way you could tell if I was a bitch

659
00:29:33,409 --> 00:29:36,709
is if somebody close to me says something
to set an alarm off in your head.

660
00:29:36,742 --> 00:29:39,009
That's the type of shit she do.
We're at dinner.

661
00:29:39,042 --> 00:29:41,075
I'm a little drunk.
I'm not gonna lie.

662
00:29:41,109 --> 00:29:43,875
I get into an argument with this guy,
hit him with some thug shit.

663
00:29:43,909 --> 00:29:45,942
"Say something else to me,
I'm gonna go to my car,

664
00:29:45,975 --> 00:29:48,409
I'ma pop the trunk
on your bitch ass. "

665
00:29:48,842 --> 00:29:50,675
That means I'm gonna
go to my car, get a gun,

666
00:29:50,709 --> 00:29:52,709
come back,
shoot this shit up.

667
00:29:52,742 --> 00:29:55,109
When I said it, she was like, "what you
gonna get, the car seat?"

668
00:29:55,142 --> 00:29:57,158
"Bitch, what-

669
00:29:57,193 --> 00:29:59,175
Oh my God.

670
00:29:59,209 --> 00:30:02,775
Why would you say that
out loud? Way to go.

671
00:30:02,809 --> 00:30:05,209
Congratulations on messing this up
for me.

672
00:30:05,242 --> 00:30:06,875
Congratulations. "

673
00:30:09,309 --> 00:30:11,309
Women, y'all make me
mad with that.

674
00:30:11,342 --> 00:30:13,375
I'm gonna tell you what
pisses me off, ladies.

675
00:30:13,409 --> 00:30:17,109
I hate the fact, women,
that you cannot control your anger.

676
00:30:17,142 --> 00:30:19,009
I hate it.
I really hate it.

677
00:30:19,042 --> 00:30:22,275
Women, you need to learn
to put a cap on your anger.

678
00:30:22,309 --> 00:30:24,975
You know what I mean
when I say "cap," sweetie? A cap.

679
00:30:25,009 --> 00:30:27,258
It means a point
that you will never go above.

680
00:30:27,309 --> 00:30:30,675
That's a cap.
Men, we have a cap.

681
00:30:31,009 --> 00:30:32,909
What's the worst thing
you'll ever say to a woman?

682
00:30:32,942 --> 00:30:34,009
- Shouldn't take that long, fellas.
- Bitch.

683
00:30:34,042 --> 00:30:37,075
"Bitch. " There you go.
Come in different levels.

684
00:30:37,109 --> 00:30:39,342
"Bitch! Hey! Bitch! Bitch!"

685
00:30:39,375 --> 00:30:43,075
Different levels.

686
00:30:43,842 --> 00:30:46,209
Women, y'all don't
have a cap.

687
00:30:46,242 --> 00:30:48,975
Y'all try to cut so deep
when you get mad.

688
00:30:49,009 --> 00:30:51,675
You want to mess with
a man's pride, his goals.

689
00:30:51,709 --> 00:30:53,909
Y'all say stuff that
ain't nobody's business.

690
00:30:53,942 --> 00:30:56,058
It's Christmas.
My mother's here.

691
00:30:56,809 --> 00:30:59,042
You bring up personal stuff
'cause you got an attitude.

692
00:30:59,075 --> 00:31:01,309
"Yeah, whatever.
Yeah, whatever.

693
00:31:01,342 --> 00:31:03,975
Whatever. Fuck you,
pissin'- in-the-bed boy.

694
00:31:05,109 --> 00:31:06,942
Uh-huh! What now?
That's right.

695
00:31:06,975 --> 00:31:09,175
Go upstairs,
flip the mattress.

696
00:31:09,209 --> 00:31:12,342
It's a big-ass piss stain
on the other side

697
00:31:12,375 --> 00:31:14,175
'cause you don't know
how to control your bladder.

698
00:31:14,209 --> 00:31:17,075
Boo-ya!
Right in front of your ma. "

699
00:31:17,109 --> 00:31:19,342
Now you gotta sit there
with the "she lyin'" face.

700
00:31:19,375 --> 00:31:23,009
"What? You're a liar.

701
00:31:23,042 --> 00:31:26,058
No, you're a liar.
You're a liar.

702
00:31:27,042 --> 00:31:29,875
That's Mountain Dew.
I didn't pee on anything. "

703
00:31:32,675 --> 00:31:35,909
That's the difference.
Ladies, y'all go too far.

704
00:31:35,942 --> 00:31:38,209
When you get mad,
y'all see red.

705
00:31:38,242 --> 00:31:40,942
Y'all go to the point
of no return, man.

706
00:31:40,975 --> 00:31:43,375
Why do you grab the steering wheel
while a man is driving?

707
00:31:43,409 --> 00:31:45,375
Why? Why?!

708
00:31:45,409 --> 00:31:48,009
We both in the car.
You're gonna kill us both.

709
00:31:48,042 --> 00:31:50,675
But you don't care
'cause you see red.

710
00:31:50,709 --> 00:31:52,342
"Fuck you!

711
00:31:54,209 --> 00:31:56,258
Kill us!
Kill us both!"

712
00:31:56,342 --> 00:31:58,675
"Hey. Hey!

713
00:31:58,709 --> 00:32:01,209
Kill your side, bitch.
Ain't no 'kill us. '

714
00:32:01,242 --> 00:32:03,975
Us ain't mad.
You got the attitude. "

715
00:32:06,209 --> 00:32:10,075
I know women.
I can break women down.

716
00:32:10,109 --> 00:32:12,342
I'm gonna
tell you guys something

717
00:32:12,375 --> 00:32:14,975
that you're not gonna like,
but you need to hear it.

718
00:32:15,009 --> 00:32:17,775
You need to hear it.
Not one woman in this room

719
00:32:17,809 --> 00:32:20,675
likes for her man to have a good time
when she's not around.

720
00:32:20,709 --> 00:32:22,242
Not one.

721
00:32:22,275 --> 00:32:24,509
It's a true statement.

722
00:32:24,742 --> 00:32:28,058
I see some of y'all lookin'
at me with attitude.

723
00:32:28,109 --> 00:32:30,809
"Not true. I don't care.
Have fun. Shut up. Kill yourself. "

724
00:32:30,842 --> 00:32:32,809
Let me tell you why.
Just listen.

725
00:32:32,842 --> 00:32:34,909
Let me tell you why
I feel like this, okay?

726
00:32:34,942 --> 00:32:36,975
I don't say anything
that I cannot prove.

727
00:32:37,009 --> 00:32:38,809
That's your lady
right there, right?

728
00:32:38,842 --> 00:32:40,842
If I'm wrong, sweetie,
tell me I'm wrong.

729
00:32:40,875 --> 00:32:43,342
You ever been out with your boys?
You're with your boys.

730
00:32:43,375 --> 00:32:45,642
You ain't doing nothing wrong.
Ain't no women around.

731
00:32:45,675 --> 00:32:48,275
You're having a good time
with your boys.

732
00:32:48,309 --> 00:32:50,709
She call you while you out.

733
00:32:50,742 --> 00:32:53,775
When you pick up the phone,
she hears fun

734
00:32:53,809 --> 00:32:56,042
in the background.

735
00:32:56,075 --> 00:32:58,042
That's why they get an attitude.
'cause she hears fun.

736
00:32:58,075 --> 00:33:00,075
You pick up the phone
having a good time.

737
00:33:02,309 --> 00:33:04,175
"Hey, shut up, Steve!

738
00:33:04,209 --> 00:33:06,509
Hey! No, hey, I ain't gonna take
another shot.

739
00:33:06,542 --> 00:33:09,242
No, hey!

740
00:33:11,942 --> 00:33:15,809
Yo, I swear to God that was like
the best night of my life.

741
00:33:15,842 --> 00:33:17,842
I swear to God.

742
00:33:17,875 --> 00:33:20,475
Hey.
Hey, what's up, babe?"

743
00:33:20,541 --> 00:33:22,341
"You know what?
Nothing. Do you.

744
00:33:22,374 --> 00:33:24,107
I haven't got time for this.

745
00:33:24,141 --> 00:33:26,358
<i>Do you, boo boo.
Do you, boo boo.</i>

746
00:33:27,741 --> 00:33:30,141
You know why?
'cause I'ma do me!

747
00:33:30,374 --> 00:33:32,841
Do you, boo boo!
Do you!

748
00:33:34,507 --> 00:33:36,007
Every time I call
you always laughing.

749
00:33:36,041 --> 00:33:38,707
What the fuck is so funny?!

750
00:33:38,741 --> 00:33:40,874
You laughing
at my stretch marks?"

751
00:33:40,907 --> 00:33:44,041
"What? Nobody knows
you have stretch marks. "

752
00:33:44,074 --> 00:33:45,907
"Whatever!"

753
00:33:46,041 --> 00:33:48,007
Y'all crazy, man.

754
00:33:48,041 --> 00:33:50,641
Y'all are crazy.

755
00:33:50,674 --> 00:33:52,641
I'm very serious, man.

756
00:33:52,674 --> 00:33:55,574
I'll- I'll go a step further.

757
00:33:55,607 --> 00:33:58,358
For those people that are not believers
yet, I'll go a step further.

758
00:33:58,874 --> 00:34:01,274
Fellas, you ever have a genuine laugh
around your lady?

759
00:34:01,307 --> 00:34:03,307
I'm talking about
to where your stomach hurt.

760
00:34:03,341 --> 00:34:05,841
You know the good laughs?
One of them.

761
00:34:07,674 --> 00:34:09,874
You ever look at your lady's face?
See how mad she get

762
00:34:09,907 --> 00:34:12,574
'cause she's not
a part of the laugh?

763
00:34:12,607 --> 00:34:14,674
Look at her face.
You think I'm lying?

764
00:34:20,874 --> 00:34:23,774
"What the hell are you laughing at?"
"I don't know.

765
00:34:23,807 --> 00:34:25,858
I thought everything was cool.
I didn't know. "

766
00:34:26,907 --> 00:34:29,207
I know what
I'm talking about.

767
00:34:29,241 --> 00:34:31,574
Ladies, I know what you guys are thinking.
You're like, "whatever.

768
00:34:31,607 --> 00:34:33,874
Men, you do
the same thing too.

769
00:34:33,907 --> 00:34:36,341
Y'all get an attitude
with us when we go out. "

770
00:34:36,374 --> 00:34:38,874
I'll tell you something, ladies.
We don't really give a fuck.

771
00:34:38,907 --> 00:34:41,774
Let me tell you why.
Hey, listen. Listen.

772
00:34:41,807 --> 00:34:44,607
We don't.
It's all an act, okay?

773
00:34:44,641 --> 00:34:48,007
If you guys could see how much fun we have
when you leave the house

774
00:34:48,041 --> 00:34:51,341
and we're alone- There's so much
fun stuff that happens.

775
00:34:51,374 --> 00:34:54,974
You'll never know about this stuff.
It's just a good time.

776
00:34:55,007 --> 00:34:58,058
We got to put on that show
so you feel like we care.

777
00:34:58,107 --> 00:35:00,074
It's all a show.

778
00:35:00,107 --> 00:35:02,274
"Babe, no.
Come on, babe.

779
00:35:02,307 --> 00:35:05,207
Babe, please.
Every night with them.

780
00:35:05,241 --> 00:35:08,041
Come on. Spend time with me,
your man-

781
00:35:08,074 --> 00:35:10,674
And the bitch is gone.
Yeah! Yeah!

782
00:35:10,707 --> 00:35:12,807
<i>Oh oh, I'm by myself</i>

783
00:35:12,841 --> 00:35:14,807
<i>What?
Oh, I'm by myself</i>

784
00:35:14,841 --> 00:35:16,774
<i>What I'm gonna do?
What I'm gonna do?</i>

785
00:35:16,807 --> 00:35:18,774
<i>I'ma beat my dick,
I'm gonna beat my dick</i>

786
00:35:18,807 --> 00:35:20,641
<i>I'ma get it,
I'ma get it</i>

787
00:35:20,674 --> 00:35:22,774
<i>Where the laptop at?
Where the laptop at?</i>

788
00:35:22,807 --> 00:35:24,541
<i>I'ma get it,
I'ma get it.</i>

789
00:35:24,574 --> 00:35:26,458
That's what we do.

790
00:35:26,974 --> 00:35:29,907
Soon as you leave, there's so much filth
that goes down.

791
00:35:37,841 --> 00:35:40,041
If you don't believe me-
If you don't believe me, ladies,

792
00:35:40,074 --> 00:35:42,207
next time you leave the house,
come back in five minutes.

793
00:35:42,241 --> 00:35:45,274
I bet you catch him
doing nasty shit.

794
00:35:45,307 --> 00:35:47,241
Bet money.
Bet money you catch him.

795
00:35:47,274 --> 00:35:48,674
Soon as you leave,
come back in.

796
00:35:48,707 --> 00:35:52,141
"Hey! Get the-
Hey, girl.

797
00:35:52,174 --> 00:35:54,307
I thought you said you was going
to work. God damn it.

798
00:35:56,174 --> 00:35:58,274
You got somebody with you?
Is somebody with you?

799
00:35:58,307 --> 00:36:00,274
Wait a minute.
Let me clean up.

800
00:36:00,307 --> 00:36:02,074
Let me blow
these candles out.

801
00:36:02,107 --> 00:36:04,007
God damn it.

802
00:36:04,041 --> 00:36:06,707
I thought you was
gonna be gone all day.

803
00:36:06,741 --> 00:36:08,741
Set up an evening
for myself,

804
00:36:08,774 --> 00:36:10,574
you gonna come back
all fast.

805
00:36:10,607 --> 00:36:12,741
Why didn't you ring a bell?
You don't ring bells?

806
00:36:12,774 --> 00:36:15,274
You just gonna use a key
'cause you live here.

807
00:36:15,307 --> 00:36:17,607
You are something else.

808
00:36:17,641 --> 00:36:19,674
Something else. "

809
00:36:22,207 --> 00:36:24,556
I know what
I'm talking about.

810
00:36:24,907 --> 00:36:27,974
Ladies, I'm gonna be honest.
I understand you guys.

811
00:36:28,007 --> 00:36:30,641
I really do.
I understand you guys.

812
00:36:30,674 --> 00:36:33,807
Your biggest fear
is not being fun.

813
00:36:33,841 --> 00:36:36,874
You don't ever want your man
to think that you're not fun.

814
00:36:36,907 --> 00:36:38,807
That's why you're always
looking for validation.

815
00:36:38,841 --> 00:36:40,774
Always. You're always
looking for validation.

816
00:36:40,807 --> 00:36:42,741
"Babe, I'm fun, right?

817
00:36:42,774 --> 00:36:45,007
Huh? Babe, look.
Remember?

818
00:36:45,041 --> 00:36:47,741
Right? Remember that time?
Remember? Jump shot.

819
00:36:47,774 --> 00:36:50,341
Remember, I was like,
'ahhh, in your face.

820
00:36:50,374 --> 00:36:53,656
Michael Jordaaan. '
remember? No?"

821
00:36:53,774 --> 00:36:55,974
See? That's why we try
to make you feel fun.

822
00:36:56,007 --> 00:36:57,941
That's why we listen
to your stories.

823
00:36:57,974 --> 00:37:00,274
To be honest, I can't stand when
women tell stories.

824
00:37:00,307 --> 00:37:02,307
I hate it.
It makes my balls itch.

825
00:37:02,341 --> 00:37:04,974
I hate it. I swear.

826
00:37:05,007 --> 00:37:08,607
It's just a bunch of words
with no plot, no middle,

827
00:37:08,641 --> 00:37:11,074
no ending
and it's always angry.

828
00:37:11,107 --> 00:37:13,641
Why are all your stories
so angry?

829
00:37:13,674 --> 00:37:15,841
Everything about work is mean.

830
00:37:15,874 --> 00:37:17,907
How come nothing good
ever happens at work?

831
00:37:17,941 --> 00:37:19,941
It's always bad.

832
00:37:19,974 --> 00:37:22,956
"Babe, let me tell you about this
bitch Sabrina at the office today.

833
00:37:23,007 --> 00:37:26,107
First of all, she comes in the office
with white stockings on

834
00:37:26,141 --> 00:37:29,974
and black shoes. Uh, excuse me, bitch,
Labor Day is over.

835
00:37:30,007 --> 00:37:32,307
Huh? 'scuse me. Boop.
Thank you.

836
00:37:32,341 --> 00:37:35,774
Backspace.
Delete that. Huh-uh. "

837
00:37:35,807 --> 00:37:39,774
They start talking about problems in
the office. We don't fuckin' know.

838
00:37:39,807 --> 00:37:41,941
"Let me tell you what she did, baby.
She come to me

839
00:37:41,974 --> 00:37:44,007
talking about, 'can you go print this
out the fax machine?'

840
00:37:44,041 --> 00:37:47,807
'Uh, no. I am an executive
administrative assistant,

841
00:37:47,841 --> 00:37:50,174
not your assistant. ' We got to act
like we know what's going on.

842
00:37:50,207 --> 00:37:52,656
"Whaaaat?

843
00:37:52,707 --> 00:37:55,774
She told you to print it
out the fax machine?

844
00:37:55,807 --> 00:37:58,107
Huh-uh.
No, she didn't.

845
00:37:58,141 --> 00:38:01,241
That bitch is crazy.
Not my baby. " "Thank you. "

846
00:38:01,274 --> 00:38:03,307
They all turn into the computers.
"Thank you.

847
00:38:03,341 --> 00:38:05,841
I told the bitch, 'boop.
Backspace. No. L-o-I.

848
00:38:05,874 --> 00:38:08,874
R- t-o-f-m-a-o.
Thank you.

849
00:38:08,907 --> 00:38:12,807
Delete that.
M- t-f-o-m-o-f-o-h-s. "

850
00:38:15,041 --> 00:38:17,241
"What did you just say?"
"Get the fuck out of my face.

851
00:38:17,274 --> 00:38:19,274
We can't curse in the office. "
"Okay. "

852
00:38:19,307 --> 00:38:22,007
I don't understand you guys.

853
00:38:22,141 --> 00:38:24,156
I love you, but I don't
understand you.

854
00:38:24,207 --> 00:38:26,307
But as men, we have to.

855
00:38:26,341 --> 00:38:28,274
I'm not gonna lie.
We're not perfect.

856
00:38:28,307 --> 00:38:30,841
We are not perfect.
I know I'm not perfect.

857
00:38:30,874 --> 00:38:34,141
The reason why, ladies?
You've got a little to do with that.

858
00:38:34,174 --> 00:38:36,741
You put men on too high
of a pedestal.

859
00:38:36,774 --> 00:38:39,174
Whatever pedestal
you have us on, take us off.

860
00:38:39,207 --> 00:38:41,874
It's too high. We're never gonna meet
your expectations.

861
00:38:41,907 --> 00:38:44,174
Take us off. I'm serious.

862
00:38:44,207 --> 00:38:48,407
Here's the thing about men:
Once you realize we do dumb shit,

863
00:38:48,507 --> 00:38:50,741
we're dumb sometimes,

864
00:38:50,774 --> 00:38:53,656
we're gonna fuck up-
That's our nature as a man.

865
00:38:53,707 --> 00:38:56,107
Once you guys realize that
we'll get along so much better.

866
00:38:56,141 --> 00:38:58,707
If you don't believe me that men
do dumb shit and don't realize it,

867
00:38:58,741 --> 00:39:00,941
listen to 'em.
Listen to the answers we give you

868
00:39:00,974 --> 00:39:02,907
when we do dumb shit.

869
00:39:02,941 --> 00:39:05,841
You ever hear how dumb
our answers are when we do dumb shit?

870
00:39:05,874 --> 00:39:08,141
"So you just gonna sit down there at
the pool with all them naked bitches?"

871
00:39:08,174 --> 00:39:10,741
"Well, I thought it was cool.

872
00:39:10,774 --> 00:39:14,207
I'm waitin' on you
to come down. "

873
00:39:16,007 --> 00:39:18,274
This right here is the national
dumb nigga stance.

874
00:39:18,307 --> 00:39:21,707
Whenever your man- Whenever he get
bow-legged and touch his face...

875
00:39:21,741 --> 00:39:23,556
"I'm waitin'
on everybody else.

876
00:39:23,607 --> 00:39:26,107
I'm thinkin' everybody
gonna eat the chips. "

877
00:39:26,141 --> 00:39:28,007
"What?

878
00:39:28,041 --> 00:39:30,041
What are you
talking about, man?"

879
00:39:31,307 --> 00:39:33,174
I know I'm not perfect.

880
00:39:33,207 --> 00:39:35,641
I know I do dumb shit.
I do.

881
00:39:35,674 --> 00:39:38,341
I can admit that.
I've never done crazy stuff.

882
00:39:38,374 --> 00:39:40,941
I ain't never put my hands on my lady.
I never went that far.

883
00:39:40,974 --> 00:39:42,907
I plunked her one time.
I did do that.

884
00:39:42,941 --> 00:39:45,574
Right in the forehead.
Mm, it was solid.

885
00:39:45,607 --> 00:39:48,907
It just jumped out my body. I
don't know where it came from.

886
00:39:48,941 --> 00:39:52,256
She was driving, I'm like, "bitch,
you think it's a game?"

887
00:39:52,674 --> 00:39:54,907
You would've thought
I'd hit her in the head with a bat.

888
00:39:54,941 --> 00:39:57,241
She went...

889
00:39:57,274 --> 00:39:59,174
I was scared.
I thought I was going to jail.

890
00:39:59,207 --> 00:40:01,607
"Hey, I'm sorry. Get your plunk back.
Here. Get it.

891
00:40:01,641 --> 00:40:03,307
Plunk me back.
Let's be even.

892
00:40:03,341 --> 00:40:05,341
Come on. Plunk me back.
I just wanna be even.

893
00:40:05,374 --> 00:40:08,774
Please please?
Can you please plunk me back?"

894
00:40:12,707 --> 00:40:16,207
That's just me being honest.
There are certain things I'm not good at.

895
00:40:16,241 --> 00:40:19,807
I'm not a good storm-outter, people.
I can admit that.

896
00:40:19,841 --> 00:40:21,274
For those who do not know
what storming out is,

897
00:40:21,307 --> 00:40:23,056
that's when you
leave the house angry.

898
00:40:23,107 --> 00:40:25,074
"I'm sick of this! I'm gone!"
Slam the door.

899
00:40:25,107 --> 00:40:27,107
Boom!
The purpose of storming out

900
00:40:27,141 --> 00:40:29,007
is to leave the illusion
in your lady's head

901
00:40:29,041 --> 00:40:30,807
that you're never
coming back.

902
00:40:30,841 --> 00:40:32,941
When you slam the door,
she's supposed to break down.

903
00:40:32,974 --> 00:40:34,941
Soon as you slam the door.
"I'm gone!" Boom!

904
00:40:34,974 --> 00:40:37,974
She breaks down. This is my impression
of a woman breaking down.

905
00:40:38,007 --> 00:40:40,174
"No. Oh my God,
please don't.

906
00:40:40,207 --> 00:40:42,941
No. No,
don't do this to me.

907
00:40:42,974 --> 00:40:45,607
No, every time I do this,
you do this.

908
00:40:45,641 --> 00:40:47,974
No. "

909
00:40:50,141 --> 00:40:51,874
I hate when women cry
and try to talk.

910
00:40:51,907 --> 00:40:53,756
I can't stand that shit.

911
00:40:53,841 --> 00:40:55,907
"I ain't wanna do that.
I ain't tryin' to do nothing. "

912
00:41:00,374 --> 00:41:03,241
I look like the first
slave to ever walk.

913
00:41:03,274 --> 00:41:06,607
"I don't want to do nothing.
I was just trying... "

914
00:41:08,207 --> 00:41:10,174
It's too much.

915
00:41:10,207 --> 00:41:12,341
I'm gonna tell you why
I'm not a good storm-outter.

916
00:41:12,374 --> 00:41:15,041
You know why?
I forget stuff.

917
00:41:15,074 --> 00:41:16,907
You can't storm out
and forget shit,

918
00:41:16,941 --> 00:41:19,207
'cause you got to go back,
get the shit you forgot.

919
00:41:19,241 --> 00:41:22,041
You look stupid. Trust me, fellas.
I know from experience.

920
00:41:22,074 --> 00:41:25,056
You leave angry-
"I'm sick of this, man! I'm done!

921
00:41:25,107 --> 00:41:27,074
I don't care!
I'm done! Forget you!

922
00:41:27,107 --> 00:41:29,174
Forget the house.
I'm out!" Boom!

923
00:41:29,207 --> 00:41:31,341
"Don't give a shit, man.
My keys. God damn it.

924
00:41:31,374 --> 00:41:33,707
My keys on the thing.

925
00:41:36,241 --> 00:41:38,007
Babe, let me get my keys
on the top of the thing.

926
00:41:38,041 --> 00:41:40,074
I left my keys up on the top of the thing.
Please. "

927
00:41:40,107 --> 00:41:42,274
I need my keys.

928
00:41:42,307 --> 00:41:44,607
I need my keys 'cause I got to
get in my car.

929
00:41:44,641 --> 00:41:46,641
When I get in my car,
I get my car on,

930
00:41:46,674 --> 00:41:48,307
step on the gas,
make the tires burn out.

931
00:41:48,341 --> 00:41:50,907
Reason why I do that?

932
00:41:50,941 --> 00:41:53,756
Women, you can't handle it.
You break down after a while.

933
00:41:53,807 --> 00:41:55,974
"Oh my God, no.
He's gonna kill himself.

934
00:41:56,007 --> 00:41:57,874
No no. Don't do it.

935
00:41:57,907 --> 00:41:59,774
Do the speed limit,
please. No.

936
00:41:59,807 --> 00:42:01,874
Every time... "

937
00:42:01,907 --> 00:42:04,241
That's my impression
of women.

938
00:42:06,741 --> 00:42:09,641
Had to get out of there.
Tell you another reason why

939
00:42:09,674 --> 00:42:11,674
I can't storm out
of the house correctly.

940
00:42:11,707 --> 00:42:14,207
My son always want to come.

941
00:42:14,241 --> 00:42:16,974
Can't storm out with a kid.
It take too long.

942
00:42:17,007 --> 00:42:18,641
A storm out's gotta be fast.

943
00:42:18,674 --> 00:42:20,274
In and out.
Boom boom, quick.

944
00:42:20,307 --> 00:42:22,141
My son be at the door.
"Mm mm. "

945
00:42:22,156 --> 00:42:25,074
"No! No!
Stay with your mother. "

946
00:42:25,107 --> 00:42:27,674
"Boy, God damn it,
stay with your ma. "

947
00:42:29,674 --> 00:42:31,874
This is when women
try to use kids as ammunition.

948
00:42:31,907 --> 00:42:35,174
"Look at you. You can't even take
your son with you.

949
00:42:35,207 --> 00:42:38,241
He want to go with his dad,
but you can't even take your son with you. "

950
00:42:38,274 --> 00:42:41,141
Now I can't be a piece of shit.
I've got to prove a point.

951
00:42:41,174 --> 00:42:43,274
I got to take him.
I'll tell you something, fellas,

952
00:42:43,307 --> 00:42:45,607
you look stupid when you
try to keep your attitude

953
00:42:45,641 --> 00:42:47,207
and get a baby's
shit together.

954
00:42:47,241 --> 00:42:48,641
You look dumb.

955
00:42:48,674 --> 00:42:50,207
From experience,
you look stupid.

956
00:42:50,241 --> 00:42:52,174
"I don't give a shit.
I'll take him.

957
00:42:52,207 --> 00:42:54,656
Get the diaper bag. Put the sippy cup
and shit in the bag.

958
00:42:54,707 --> 00:42:56,207
Put the change of clothes
and shit in the bag. "

959
00:42:56,241 --> 00:42:57,641
This is when I knew
I looked stupid.

960
00:42:57,674 --> 00:42:59,074
When I did this
with the diaper bag,

961
00:42:59,107 --> 00:43:00,974
"bitch, you think
I give a fuck about you-

962
00:43:01,007 --> 00:43:03,774
Let me tell you something,
you got another thing coming. "

963
00:43:03,807 --> 00:43:06,874
When I swung the diaper bag
over my shoulder-

964
00:43:06,907 --> 00:43:10,274
"You got another
goddamn thing coming

965
00:43:10,307 --> 00:43:12,307
if you think
I give a shit. "

966
00:43:14,141 --> 00:43:17,041
It wasn't good, man.

967
00:43:17,074 --> 00:43:19,641
This is me
speaking the truth.

968
00:43:19,674 --> 00:43:21,641
See, I can talk
about relationships.

969
00:43:21,674 --> 00:43:23,956
I've been in one for years.
I know relationships.

970
00:43:24,041 --> 00:43:26,041
I see a lot of couples
here together.

971
00:43:26,074 --> 00:43:28,174
You guys don't understand
what you're in.

972
00:43:28,207 --> 00:43:30,207
You don't know
how serious it is.

973
00:43:30,241 --> 00:43:33,007
I don't mind seeing couples.
I don't like seeing new couples.

974
00:43:33,041 --> 00:43:35,174
I can't stand new love.
I hate it.

975
00:43:35,207 --> 00:43:37,207
That's me being honest.
It's too much.

976
00:43:37,241 --> 00:43:39,141
I don't like over love.

977
00:43:39,174 --> 00:43:42,907
You ever see those couples
that go too far, that's too much?

978
00:43:42,941 --> 00:43:46,607
You ever see a couple
that's newly in love try to share?

979
00:43:46,641 --> 00:43:48,341
You ever witness that?

980
00:43:48,374 --> 00:43:51,007
"Hey, babe.
Hey. Babe.

981
00:43:51,041 --> 00:43:54,156
Hey, love button.

982
00:43:54,174 --> 00:43:56,607
Hey, I got a little bit
of juice left.

983
00:43:56,641 --> 00:43:58,341
You want some juice?

984
00:43:58,374 --> 00:44:00,841
Yeah? You wanna take a sip,
I'll take a sip, you take a sip?

985
00:44:00,874 --> 00:44:02,741
You want to do it
like that?

986
00:44:02,774 --> 00:44:04,307
You wanna go 'sip sip sip' like that
back and forth?

987
00:44:04,341 --> 00:44:06,074
Yeah? Go ahead.
Take a sip.

988
00:44:06,107 --> 00:44:07,807
Ah. Give it to me.

989
00:44:07,841 --> 00:44:09,774
You do it.

990
00:44:12,907 --> 00:44:14,641
Same time. Do it.
Your nose is in the way.

991
00:44:14,674 --> 00:44:16,774
No, your nose is in the way.

992
00:44:16,807 --> 00:44:18,841
I love you. "

993
00:44:18,874 --> 00:44:21,841
Too much.
I fuckin' hate it.

994
00:44:21,874 --> 00:44:23,656
I like older couples.

995
00:44:23,707 --> 00:44:25,774
I like couples
that's got time in, man.

996
00:44:25,807 --> 00:44:28,341
You know why? I like to see those
couples argue.

997
00:44:28,374 --> 00:44:32,174
Couples with time in, small problems
become big problems.

998
00:44:32,207 --> 00:44:34,241
If you've got time in,

999
00:44:34,274 --> 00:44:37,274
juice can become a problem.

1000
00:44:37,307 --> 00:44:40,807
Let you go buy some juice and she's
with you while you buy the juice.

1001
00:44:40,841 --> 00:44:43,907
You go outside, open up the juice,
she asks for a sip.

1002
00:44:43,941 --> 00:44:47,207
Bet money you lose your mind
over that sip of juice.

1003
00:44:47,241 --> 00:44:50,241
Bet money you snap. Soon as you
get outside, "babe, let me get a sip. "

1004
00:44:50,274 --> 00:44:53,056
"Uh, bitch, didn't you just see me
buy the juice when I was inside?

1005
00:44:53,141 --> 00:44:55,574
So if you wanted some juice,
why didn't you ask for some juice?

1006
00:44:55,607 --> 00:44:57,274
Now you want a sip of my juice,
fuck around,

1007
00:44:57,307 --> 00:44:59,141
take a double sip,
I'm left with a little ass sip

1008
00:44:59,174 --> 00:45:01,274
'cause your over-thirsty ass
want to take a double sip.

1009
00:45:01,307 --> 00:45:04,041
No, get your own juice.
Walk your fat ass inside,

1010
00:45:04,074 --> 00:45:05,874
you sippin'- juice bastard.

1011
00:45:05,907 --> 00:45:08,874
You wasn't even
thinking about juice. "

1012
00:45:08,907 --> 00:45:10,674
That'll be
on your mind all day.

1013
00:45:10,707 --> 00:45:12,741
Seven hours later,
you'll bring it back up.

1014
00:45:12,774 --> 00:45:17,007
"A sip of my goddamn juice.
You are something else, you know that?

1015
00:45:17,041 --> 00:45:19,974
You are something else.
You weren't even thinking about the juice. "

1016
00:45:23,497 --> 00:45:26,130
I got into an argument
over mashed potatoes one time.

1017
00:45:26,163 --> 00:45:28,297
We almost broke up.

1018
00:45:28,330 --> 00:45:30,030
I'm very serious.
You know what I don't play?

1019
00:45:30,263 --> 00:45:32,463
I don't play that picking off
my plate stuff, ladies.

1020
00:45:32,497 --> 00:45:35,097
Don't pick off my plate.
I'm very serious.

1021
00:45:35,130 --> 00:45:38,463
I don't like it. In the
beginning, men, we have to do it.

1022
00:45:38,497 --> 00:45:41,597
The reason why? We're
still trying to impress you.

1023
00:45:41,630 --> 00:45:44,330
So we go overboard.
"Hey, you want a little piece?

1024
00:45:44,363 --> 00:45:46,297
Yeah?
You want me to cut it?

1025
00:45:46,330 --> 00:45:48,330
Yeah, I'll cut it.
I'll give you all this.

1026
00:45:48,363 --> 00:45:50,297
I'll just leave this
little piece for myself.

1027
00:45:50,330 --> 00:45:53,230
Yeah. No no no. I probably
should eat the whole thing

1028
00:45:53,263 --> 00:45:55,530
'cause I'm a diabetic, but no,
I just want you to be happy.

1029
00:45:55,563 --> 00:45:57,563
Yeah. You should
definitely drive home.

1030
00:45:57,597 --> 00:45:59,430
I can't see.
It's a little blurry. "

1031
00:46:01,230 --> 00:46:03,497
We go overboard. I'm gonna
tell you why I got mad.

1032
00:46:03,530 --> 00:46:06,230
We're at a restaurant
getting ready to eat dinner.

1033
00:46:06,263 --> 00:46:08,430
Her food comes out before
mine. "You want me to wait?"

1034
00:46:08,463 --> 00:46:10,363
I said, "no, eat your food.
Mine'll be out.

1035
00:46:10,397 --> 00:46:11,730
Don't worry about it. "
She's eating.

1036
00:46:11,763 --> 00:46:13,230
I don't ask for any of her food.

1037
00:46:13,263 --> 00:46:15,630
"Enjoy your food, babe. "
My food comes out.

1038
00:46:15,663 --> 00:46:17,797
He says, "enjoy your meal. "
I said, "thank you, sir. "

1039
00:46:17,830 --> 00:46:19,797
I take my napkin, fop,
put it on my lap.

1040
00:46:19,830 --> 00:46:23,163
The reason I go fop, it's big
to me 'cause I'm small.

1041
00:46:23,197 --> 00:46:25,130
It takes up a lot of space.

1042
00:46:25,163 --> 00:46:27,130
So I bow my head
to say my grace.

1043
00:46:27,163 --> 00:46:30,130
As I'm saying my grace, I
hear a metal fork on my plate.

1044
00:46:32,163 --> 00:46:34,197
"Uh, bitch, you can't wait
till I'm done talking to Jesus

1045
00:46:34,230 --> 00:46:36,197
before you touch
my goddamn plate?"

1046
00:46:36,230 --> 00:46:40,097
You know how mad that made me?
"Take the goddamn food, bitch!"

1047
00:46:40,130 --> 00:46:42,097
I snapped.
I get mad fast.

1048
00:46:42,130 --> 00:46:45,363
Little shit pisses me off.
Takes a lot of patience, man.

1049
00:46:45,397 --> 00:46:47,663
Whole lot of patience
to be in a relationship.

1050
00:46:47,697 --> 00:46:50,563
I'm understanding that now. I'm
understanding that in a relationship,

1051
00:46:50,663 --> 00:46:53,730
things will change, people.
Nothing stays great forever.

1052
00:46:53,763 --> 00:46:56,297
Sex will change.

1053
00:46:56,330 --> 00:46:58,097
In the beginning,
it's amazing.

1054
00:46:58,130 --> 00:47:00,597
You know why?
Men, we're creative.

1055
00:47:00,630 --> 00:47:03,397
We're spontaneous. We've got a
bunch of stuff we want you to do.

1056
00:47:03,430 --> 00:47:05,263
"Come on, let's do this.
Let's try this. "

1057
00:47:05,297 --> 00:47:06,697
We've got a whole
bunch of stuff.

1058
00:47:06,730 --> 00:47:08,763
But after a while, fellas,
we get repetitive.

1059
00:47:08,797 --> 00:47:11,797
We start to do the same thing
over and over again.

1060
00:47:11,830 --> 00:47:13,697
Your lady will never
tell you this.

1061
00:47:13,730 --> 00:47:15,797
You got to be a real man.
You got to check your ego

1062
00:47:15,830 --> 00:47:18,263
to figure this out. I'm gonna
tell you how you can tell

1063
00:47:18,297 --> 00:47:20,197
if you've been doing
the same stuff for years.

1064
00:47:20,230 --> 00:47:22,628
She ever get into a position
before you put her in it?

1065
00:47:22,730 --> 00:47:25,297
Think about it.

1066
00:47:25,330 --> 00:47:28,130
Just think about it a second.
That's how you can tell.

1067
00:47:28,163 --> 00:47:31,563
That's how they mess with you.
You'll be having sex, she's like...

1068
00:47:37,230 --> 00:47:39,063
"You want me to turn
over, right? I knew it.

1069
00:47:39,097 --> 00:47:41,130
Same thing since '88.
You ain't changed. "

1070
00:47:42,697 --> 00:47:44,730
She start answering questions
before you ask 'em.

1071
00:47:44,763 --> 00:47:46,797
"It's yours. "
"I ain't say shit. " "You're about to.

1072
00:47:46,830 --> 00:47:49,330
You say the same thing every
time my ass get up in the air.

1073
00:47:49,363 --> 00:47:51,563
You're about to come.
Watch, here it come.

1074
00:47:51,597 --> 00:47:53,530
You came?
I told you. High-five.

1075
00:47:53,563 --> 00:47:55,530
What'd I tell you? I know
my man. Give it to me.

1076
00:47:55,563 --> 00:47:58,297
Up top. "
Your dumb ass get up dancing.

1077
00:47:58,330 --> 00:48:00,430
"You're goddamn right.
I tore that thing up. "

1078
00:48:00,463 --> 00:48:02,330
No, you didn't.
No, you didn't.

1079
00:48:02,363 --> 00:48:05,263
It's the same dumbass moves
that you've been doing.

1080
00:48:07,697 --> 00:48:10,297
I know I'm not good at
sex anymore. I know it.

1081
00:48:10,330 --> 00:48:14,230
No need for me to lie.
We've been together too long.

1082
00:48:14,263 --> 00:48:16,730
I'm not gonna lie. I've tried
to rekindle this flame, people.

1083
00:48:16,763 --> 00:48:19,063
I have.
I tried to spice it up.

1084
00:48:19,097 --> 00:48:21,097
Tried having
phone sex and stuff,

1085
00:48:21,130 --> 00:48:23,630
but it's hard for me. I've got
too many people in my house.

1086
00:48:23,663 --> 00:48:25,797
I got kids,
I got a nanny.

1087
00:48:25,830 --> 00:48:27,230
I got to call
at the right time.

1088
00:48:27,263 --> 00:48:28,797
I call one time,
she picked up.

1089
00:48:28,830 --> 00:48:31,430
I was like, "what you doin'?"
"Nothing. Laying down"

1090
00:48:31,463 --> 00:48:34,097
I said, "why don't you lick your
finger and touch your nipple?"

1091
00:48:34,130 --> 00:48:36,730
She said, "what?" I said,
"shut up. Just do it. "

1092
00:48:36,763 --> 00:48:38,630
Out of nowhere,
all I heard was,

1093
00:48:38,663 --> 00:48:40,497
"daddy, you want me
to do mine too?"

1094
00:48:40,530 --> 00:48:44,030
"Hello? Hello?

1095
00:48:44,063 --> 00:48:46,030
Hello?

1096
00:48:46,063 --> 00:48:48,030
Is that the baby
on the phone?

1097
00:48:48,063 --> 00:48:50,796
Well, what the hell is the baby
doing on the goddamn phone?"

1098
00:48:51,563 --> 00:48:53,363
When I came home,
it's like, "daddy!"

1099
00:48:54,397 --> 00:48:56,097
"Hey, no!

1100
00:48:56,130 --> 00:48:58,463
No! Come here.
That's gay!

1101
00:48:58,497 --> 00:49:00,663
Come here.
Let me tell you something!"

1102
00:49:00,697 --> 00:49:02,697
I didn't know what to do.

1103
00:49:02,730 --> 00:49:05,663
I did not know what to do.

1104
00:49:05,697 --> 00:49:08,063
It's a difficult time for me.

1105
00:49:10,530 --> 00:49:12,430
I'm gonna
tell you something.

1106
00:49:12,463 --> 00:49:15,530
I'm gonna tell you where
all of my sex advice comes from.

1107
00:49:15,563 --> 00:49:19,063
My grandpop. My grandpop
gives me the best advice ever.

1108
00:49:19,097 --> 00:49:21,480
I love my grandpop to death. I wish
everybody could meet my grandpop.

1109
00:49:21,497 --> 00:49:24,030
If you're lucky enough to have
your grandparents in your life,

1110
00:49:24,063 --> 00:49:26,530
and you wanna laugh-
Listen to me.

1111
00:49:26,563 --> 00:49:28,563
Shouts out to all y'all
with grandparents.

1112
00:49:28,597 --> 00:49:31,297
If you got a grandparent
in your life

1113
00:49:31,330 --> 00:49:34,163
and want to laugh, ask your
grandpop- Just see what he say-

1114
00:49:34,197 --> 00:49:36,030
Say, "grandpop, when's the
last time you had some ass?"

1115
00:49:36,063 --> 00:49:38,730
Just to see-
Just to see what he says.

1116
00:49:38,763 --> 00:49:43,597
I promise you it'll be the funniest
shit you ever heard in your life.

1117
00:49:43,630 --> 00:49:46,230
My grandpop never answered.
He just said a bunch of stuff.

1118
00:49:46,263 --> 00:49:49,563
This is not a joke. I said, "grandpop,
when's the last time you had some ass?"

1119
00:49:50,697 --> 00:49:51,993
"Hey hey, look at me.

1120
00:49:52,097 --> 00:49:54,263
Okay?
Hey hey.

1121
00:49:54,297 --> 00:49:56,430
Hey. What'd I do?
You know what I did.

1122
00:49:56,463 --> 00:49:59,163
All right? Okay?
Let me tell you something.

1123
00:49:59,197 --> 00:50:02,230
I put that key in that door and
locked that motherfucker, didn't I?

1124
00:50:02,263 --> 00:50:05,197
Hey. Okay? Hey. Gave her
that goddamn 'wha-whan,'

1125
00:50:05,230 --> 00:50:09,063
yes, I did. Yes, I did!
Look at my eyes. Roll 'em. "

1126
00:50:09,097 --> 00:50:12,530
"What? What does
any of that mean?

1127
00:50:12,563 --> 00:50:14,397
What did you just say?

1128
00:50:14,430 --> 00:50:17,363
What did you say,
grandpop?"

1129
00:50:23,063 --> 00:50:25,030
I'm telling you, man,
he's funny.

1130
00:50:25,063 --> 00:50:29,430
My grandpa's one of those
old down-south old men.

1131
00:50:29,463 --> 00:50:33,163
When my grandpa cuss, he pronounce
every letter in the cuss word.

1132
00:50:33,197 --> 00:50:36,163
"Sh-ee-it-tt!"
Like he's serious.

1133
00:50:36,197 --> 00:50:38,197
He's serious old, man.

1134
00:50:38,230 --> 00:50:41,730
Let me tell you. This is
what he does every day.

1135
00:50:41,763 --> 00:50:44,530
All my grandpop do every day...
He just stand at the screen door

1136
00:50:44,563 --> 00:50:46,597
and just complain
and shit.

1137
00:50:46,630 --> 00:50:48,397
He just fuss all day.

1138
00:50:48,430 --> 00:50:50,697
"Look look look look
look look look.

1139
00:50:50,730 --> 00:50:53,263
Look look look at this.
Somebody come look at this.

1140
00:50:53,297 --> 00:50:56,763
Look at this.
Somebody come look at this.

1141
00:50:56,797 --> 00:50:58,797
Look at this.

1142
00:50:58,830 --> 00:51:02,530
Goddamn cat drinking milk
out the bowl.

1143
00:51:02,563 --> 00:51:05,430
Get out the bowl!"
This is what makes me laugh.

1144
00:51:05,463 --> 00:51:08,763
After he yell at somethin',
he stare at it for a long time.

1145
00:51:08,797 --> 00:51:10,997
"Get out the bowl!"

1146
00:51:32,430 --> 00:51:34,530
He was asleep.
He fell asleep.

1147
00:51:36,763 --> 00:51:39,263
I wish y'all could see him.

1148
00:51:39,297 --> 00:51:40,797
Kids be teasin' him.

1149
00:51:40,830 --> 00:51:42,697
Kids are mean, man.

1150
00:51:42,730 --> 00:51:45,363
Why are kids so mean?

1151
00:51:45,397 --> 00:51:48,330
Cause they know he can't
get out the screen door.

1152
00:51:49,463 --> 00:51:51,497
They tease him.
They come up to the door.

1153
00:51:53,063 --> 00:51:55,063
Shit.
He gets so mad.

1154
00:51:57,130 --> 00:52:00,163
Have you ever seen
an old person

1155
00:52:00,197 --> 00:52:02,697
get real pissed off till
they start making them noises?

1156
00:52:04,763 --> 00:52:07,030
"What?
What'd he say?"

1157
00:52:07,063 --> 00:52:09,163
"He's just angry.

1158
00:52:09,197 --> 00:52:11,730
He's an angry old man. "

1159
00:52:13,197 --> 00:52:15,263
I saw my grandpop fall
one time.

1160
00:52:17,097 --> 00:52:18,630
Funniest shit I've ever
seen in my life.

1161
00:52:18,663 --> 00:52:21,597
Took my grandpop
47 seconds to fall.

1162
00:52:23,463 --> 00:52:26,230
It took too long.
It took way too long.

1163
00:52:26,263 --> 00:52:28,597
It's funny,
but it's not funny.

1164
00:52:28,630 --> 00:52:30,463
I'm gonna show you
exactly what I saw.

1165
00:52:30,497 --> 00:52:34,297
This is how my grandpa fell.
This is exactly what I saw.

1166
00:52:48,530 --> 00:52:51,196
I got tired of watching.
I just kicked it. "Stop. Let go.

1167
00:52:51,197 --> 00:52:53,730
Stop it. Stop it.
It could have been over.

1168
00:52:53,763 --> 00:52:55,697
You've not even
got that far. Stop.

1169
00:52:55,730 --> 00:52:58,563
It's too much, grandpop. "

1170
00:53:04,597 --> 00:53:06,697
Watching people fall
is funny.

1171
00:53:07,030 --> 00:53:09,097
When was the last time
you really fell?

1172
00:53:09,130 --> 00:53:11,297
"Oh oh oh!"
One of those.

1173
00:53:11,330 --> 00:53:13,997
"Oh no no!"

1174
00:53:15,330 --> 00:53:17,397
Hey, Shaq, when you fall
during the games,

1175
00:53:17,430 --> 00:53:19,497
it's the funniest shit
I've ever seen in my life.

1176
00:53:21,263 --> 00:53:23,763
Hey, you ever see his legs
after he fall?

1177
00:53:23,797 --> 00:53:25,797
Next time, look.
I'm telling you, y'all.

1178
00:53:25,830 --> 00:53:27,730
Next time you watch a game and
he fall, this exactly what he do.

1179
00:53:27,763 --> 00:53:29,697
Look, it's always
something stupid.

1180
00:53:29,730 --> 00:53:31,997
He go up to get a rebound,
he don't get it. "Oh. No. "

1181
00:53:49,063 --> 00:53:50,697
LeBron. This is LeBron.
Look at him.

1182
00:53:50,730 --> 00:53:54,030
"God damn it, Shaq.
Get your ass- Shit, man.

1183
00:53:54,063 --> 00:53:57,463
Get up. " "I didn't
know. I didn't know. "

1184
00:54:04,363 --> 00:54:06,263
Okay, one more, one more.

1185
00:54:06,297 --> 00:54:08,797
Shaq, this is how
you fall frontwards.

1186
00:54:08,830 --> 00:54:10,763
"Hey, no.
Oh God, please. "

1187
00:54:24,163 --> 00:54:27,763
Holy shit!
Holy shit!

1188
00:54:27,797 --> 00:54:31,197
Oh, y'all got to look
at the coach's face.

1189
00:54:31,230 --> 00:54:33,263
Y'all don't watch
the right shit, man.

1190
00:54:34,630 --> 00:54:37,063
This is Shaq falling
and this is the coach.

1191
00:54:39,197 --> 00:54:41,297
"Somebody help his ass up.

1192
00:54:41,330 --> 00:54:44,063
LeBron, get him up!"

1193
00:54:51,230 --> 00:54:53,163
"No no no.

1194
00:54:53,197 --> 00:54:55,397
I pushed him too hard. "

1195
00:54:58,130 --> 00:55:00,397
I told you I was gonna
fuck with you.

1196
00:55:03,363 --> 00:55:05,930
I'm gonna tell y'all, the
fucked-up part about that joke?

1197
00:55:05,963 --> 00:55:08,630
I fucked my knee up just now.
That shit hurt.

1198
00:55:08,663 --> 00:55:11,797
That shit hurt so goddamn
bad. I tried to run it off.

1199
00:55:11,830 --> 00:55:13,797
That shit locked up
on me, didn't it?

1200
00:55:15,030 --> 00:55:17,563
That age is coming out.
That shit hurt like hell.

1201
00:55:19,263 --> 00:55:21,630
Talking about people falling.

1202
00:55:21,663 --> 00:55:23,597
Tell you who else is funny
to watch fall.

1203
00:55:23,630 --> 00:55:26,763
Women, you don't fall,
you buckle.

1204
00:55:26,797 --> 00:55:29,330
I like watching you guys buckle:
That heel.

1205
00:55:29,363 --> 00:55:31,330
Fop fop.
I like that.

1206
00:55:31,363 --> 00:55:34,697
That heel get hold of y'all.
Fop fop real quick.

1207
00:55:34,730 --> 00:55:37,063
Oh, that's the funniest
shit ever to me.

1208
00:55:37,097 --> 00:55:38,763
Y'all don't know
how to play it off.

1209
00:55:38,797 --> 00:55:40,730
Y'all don't know-

1210
00:55:40,763 --> 00:55:43,130
They don't know what to do
so they try to stay regular.

1211
00:55:43,163 --> 00:55:45,363
It's always on a cute night.
"No, girl. They talkin' 'bout-

1212
00:55:45,397 --> 00:55:47,563
Tonight- No no, bitch.

1213
00:55:47,597 --> 00:55:49,663
Please, get the-
Get the heel.

1214
00:55:49,697 --> 00:55:51,697
No, it's slushy.
Get the heel.

1215
00:55:51,730 --> 00:55:54,330
Get the heel
back there, please. "

1216
00:55:58,163 --> 00:56:00,297
Or y'all do-
Or y'all do that shit-

1217
00:56:00,330 --> 00:56:03,163
Or y'all do that shit
where y'all miss a step.

1218
00:56:03,197 --> 00:56:05,330
You ever see a girl
miss a step?

1219
00:56:05,363 --> 00:56:07,297
She don't fall down the steps.
Y'all ride 'em.

1220
00:56:07,330 --> 00:56:09,230
"N-n-no. "
Y'all do that right there?

1221
00:56:09,263 --> 00:56:11,230
"N-n-no no no.
N- n-no. "

1222
00:56:11,263 --> 00:56:15,030
You ever notice there's always
a pervert guy to catch you?

1223
00:56:15,063 --> 00:56:17,063
"N-n-no. " "I got you.
God damn. I got you.

1224
00:56:17,097 --> 00:56:19,597
Oh, damn it.
God damn.

1225
00:56:19,630 --> 00:56:21,597
You almost fell,
didn't you?

1226
00:56:21,630 --> 00:56:24,430
I got you. No, I got
you by your titties.

1227
00:56:24,463 --> 00:56:26,697
That's what I caught
you by- Your titties.

1228
00:56:26,730 --> 00:56:28,497
Jesus.

1229
00:56:28,530 --> 00:56:31,163
I've never seen
anybody fall like that.

1230
00:56:31,197 --> 00:56:33,430
That was good.
I caught her right there.

1231
00:56:33,463 --> 00:56:35,663
Did you see how I caught her?
Her titty was in my hand. "

1232
00:56:40,797 --> 00:56:43,563
I'm joking around and
making fun of people falling,

1233
00:56:43,597 --> 00:56:45,597
old people and stuff,
but I can do that.

1234
00:56:45,630 --> 00:56:48,497
Know why? I have old people
in my life that I'm close to.

1235
00:56:48,530 --> 00:56:50,597
My road manager and I
are very close.

1236
00:56:50,630 --> 00:56:54,330
He's older. He's old.
We fight a lot though.

1237
00:56:54,363 --> 00:56:56,630
It's kind of like a relationship.
Been around me for years.

1238
00:56:56,663 --> 00:56:58,763
He was with me before money
even came into the picture.

1239
00:56:58,797 --> 00:57:00,397
He's the one scrambling
up for me.

1240
00:57:00,430 --> 00:57:02,263
When you're around
somebody for so long,

1241
00:57:02,297 --> 00:57:03,663
naturally you start
to butt heads.

1242
00:57:03,697 --> 00:57:05,230
Little shit annoy you.

1243
00:57:05,263 --> 00:57:07,230
I don't like
the way he sneezes.

1244
00:57:07,263 --> 00:57:09,163
I don't like it.

1245
00:57:09,197 --> 00:57:12,498
I swear to God, when he
sneeze, it's a close call.

1246
00:57:12,563 --> 00:57:14,363
You think he's about to die.

1247
00:57:14,397 --> 00:57:16,797
This is how he sneeze.
I'm not bullshitting.

1248
00:57:16,830 --> 00:57:18,797
It's the scariest shit
I've ever heard in my life.

1249
00:57:26,130 --> 00:57:29,030
I've never seen nobody catch
their breath from a sneeze.

1250
00:57:30,563 --> 00:57:32,430
He's old though, man.

1251
00:57:32,463 --> 00:57:34,463
He does so much shit
that pisses me off.

1252
00:57:34,497 --> 00:57:38,530
I don't like it when people
are slow. He's very slow.

1253
00:57:38,563 --> 00:57:41,380
When you get in the car, how
long does it take you to pull off?

1254
00:57:41,430 --> 00:57:43,430
A couple seconds, right?

1255
00:57:43,463 --> 00:57:46,130
Okay. It took him 25 minutes
to pull off the other day.

1256
00:57:47,363 --> 00:57:51,363
I'm dead serious.
I can't tell you. I got to show you.

1257
00:57:51,497 --> 00:57:53,830
But don't make me
laugh, okay?

1258
00:57:53,763 --> 00:57:55,597
I'm gonna show you
exactly what he did.

1259
00:57:55,630 --> 00:57:58,297
Okay. I'm in the car.
I'm in the passenger seat.

1260
00:57:58,330 --> 00:58:00,197
I got my seatbelt on.
I'm ready for him.

1261
00:58:00,230 --> 00:58:02,230
All he's got to do
is get in, pull off.

1262
00:58:02,263 --> 00:58:04,830
I'm gonna show you.
Don't make me laugh though.

1263
00:58:07,763 --> 00:58:09,630
"All right.
Let's go.

1264
00:58:11,063 --> 00:58:13,097
Okay.

1265
00:59:25,130 --> 00:59:27,997
Oh. Oh no.

1266
00:59:28,030 --> 00:59:30,030
Okay.
Hey hey.

1267
00:59:30,063 --> 00:59:31,930
Hey, Kevin.

1268
00:59:31,963 --> 00:59:34,530
Hey, Kevin.
Hey, Kevin.

1269
00:59:34,563 --> 00:59:37,163
Hey.
Hey hey, Kevin.

1270
00:59:37,197 --> 00:59:39,597
Look where they at. "

1271
00:59:50,063 --> 00:59:52,897
Now I don't wanna laugh 'cause
I wanna see what he's gonna say

1272
00:59:52,930 --> 00:59:55,097
about taking so long.
This is exactly what he did.

1273
00:59:55,130 --> 00:59:57,530
I'm not bullshitting.
"Oh God. All right.

1274
00:59:57,563 --> 00:59:59,597
All right, let's go.
All right.

1275
00:59:59,630 --> 01:00:02,663
Got it.
All right, got it.

1276
01:00:02,697 --> 01:00:04,797
Got it.

1277
01:00:05,797 --> 01:00:07,563
Got it.

1278
01:00:07,597 --> 01:00:10,030
You ready? You ready
to get on out of here?"

1279
01:00:10,063 --> 01:00:12,763
"What the f-
Yes. I'm waiting on you. Come on. "

1280
01:00:12,797 --> 01:00:15,730
This is the shit that pissed
me off. He's all, "let's go.

1281
01:00:15,763 --> 01:00:18,163
Gotcha gotcha gotcha. "

1282
01:00:18,197 --> 01:00:20,097
What the fuck is this?

1283
01:00:22,063 --> 01:00:24,730
"Why are you shooting at me?"
That shit made me so mad.

1284
01:00:24,763 --> 01:00:27,630
Like "what the fuck? Don't
put your hands in my face.

1285
01:00:27,663 --> 01:00:29,630
You're being an asshole.
Just drive, man.

1286
01:00:29,663 --> 01:00:31,630
Don't say shit to me.
Just drive the car. "

1287
01:00:31,663 --> 01:00:33,663
That is the only time
I've ever cussed at Nate.

1288
01:00:33,697 --> 01:00:35,297
He'd never got mad to the
point where he'd cuss back.

1289
01:00:35,330 --> 01:00:37,097
This is the first time
he ever cussed back at me.

1290
01:00:37,130 --> 01:00:39,830
I could tell how old he was
by the way he cussed at me.

1291
01:00:39,863 --> 01:00:42,230
"Let me tell you
something, sucka.

1292
01:00:42,263 --> 01:00:44,763
Hey! Listen, Jack,

1293
01:00:44,797 --> 01:00:46,863
you ain't nothing but a piece
of cheese without the corners.

1294
01:00:46,897 --> 01:00:49,130
In other words, you ain't
never gonna be a slice, bitch. "

1295
01:00:53,563 --> 01:00:54,730
"What did you just say to me?"

1296
01:00:54,763 --> 01:00:57,063
"You heard what the fuck I said. "

1297
01:00:57,097 --> 01:00:59,830
Here's the thing-
I give Nate a lot of shit.

1298
01:00:59,863 --> 01:01:01,663
I tease Nate a lot, okay?

1299
01:01:01,697 --> 01:01:04,063
But at the end of the day,
he's got my back.

1300
01:01:04,097 --> 01:01:06,230
I know he does. Nate'd take
a bullet for me if he had to.

1301
01:01:06,263 --> 01:01:08,863
How do I know this? It's
been confirmed. All right?

1302
01:01:09,097 --> 01:01:11,597
We was in Dallas, Texas-

1303
01:01:11,630 --> 01:01:14,497
Me, Nate, my boy Harry,

1304
01:01:14,530 --> 01:01:16,530
Wayne, spank-
My lady was with me.

1305
01:01:16,563 --> 01:01:19,030
We having a good time. We do a
show, we're at the after party.

1306
01:01:19,063 --> 01:01:21,297
We gettin' it in.

1307
01:01:24,563 --> 01:01:26,163
We gettin' it in, right?

1308
01:01:26,197 --> 01:01:28,263
I look up,
the owner of the club,

1309
01:01:28,297 --> 01:01:30,563
he got my lady by the arm,
her girlfriend by the other arm,

1310
01:01:30,597 --> 01:01:32,763
he's throwing them out.
I saw it happen,

1311
01:01:32,797 --> 01:01:34,830
but I acted like I didn't 'cause
I didn't want to be a part of it.

1312
01:01:34,863 --> 01:01:36,763
I didn't want
to be involved.

1313
01:01:36,797 --> 01:01:38,697
My boy Wayne was like, "yo,
he got your girl by the arm. "

1314
01:01:38,730 --> 01:01:40,696
"What? Chill. Don't
nobody do shit. I got it. "

1315
01:01:40,697 --> 01:01:42,763
I run up to him. I say, "don't
put your hands on my lady, man. "

1316
01:01:42,797 --> 01:01:44,930
I pushed him.
He didn't go back that far,

1317
01:01:44,963 --> 01:01:47,797
but it was a good push
for me. It was all I had.

1318
01:01:47,830 --> 01:01:49,697
When I did it,
he was like, "security!"

1319
01:01:49,730 --> 01:01:52,063
Security came up, grabbed me,
put me in a full-Nelson.

1320
01:01:52,097 --> 01:01:54,663
Now you know how you think
you making somebody struggle?

1321
01:01:54,697 --> 01:01:55,997
You think you
give 'em a hard way to go?

1322
01:01:56,030 --> 01:01:57,530
I thought I was,
but I wasn't.

1323
01:01:57,563 --> 01:01:59,563
I was just moving my face.
I was like...

1324
01:02:01,630 --> 01:02:04,163
So now in my mind, I'm like,
"where is Wayne at?"

1325
01:02:04,197 --> 01:02:07,197
That's my security guard. That's who
I pay for shit like this not to happen.

1326
01:02:07,230 --> 01:02:10,597
On cue, Wayne and my boy
spank come running up,

1327
01:02:10,630 --> 01:02:12,563
they grab the security guards.
They're like, "get off him.

1328
01:02:12,597 --> 01:02:14,597
Let him go. "
Now I hear 'em.

1329
01:02:14,630 --> 01:02:17,063
I'm still in a full-Nelson,
but I hear my friends

1330
01:02:17,097 --> 01:02:19,230
so I feel better.
I know I'm safe now.

1331
01:02:19,263 --> 01:02:22,230
But before they let me go,
the owner mushes me!

1332
01:02:22,263 --> 01:02:25,530
He puts his hand on my face.
"I said get the fuck outta here. "

1333
01:02:25,563 --> 01:02:28,030
Mushed me. I never had nobody
put their hand on my face.

1334
01:02:28,063 --> 01:02:30,263
I didn't know what to do.
I didn't know how to get it off.

1335
01:02:30,297 --> 01:02:32,963
I panicked.
I panicked.

1336
01:02:32,997 --> 01:02:35,663
I licked his palm.

1337
01:02:35,697 --> 01:02:37,163
I licked the shit
out of his palm.

1338
01:02:37,197 --> 01:02:39,063
"Get your hands...
Off my face. "

1339
01:02:39,097 --> 01:02:41,930
He was like...

1340
01:02:41,963 --> 01:02:44,230
Then they let me go.
Now I'm free,

1341
01:02:44,263 --> 01:02:46,697
but I'm not leaving 'cause I don't
want him to think I'm a bitch.

1342
01:02:46,730 --> 01:02:49,297
So I run back up to him. "Yo, man,
don't put your hands on my face.

1343
01:02:49,330 --> 01:02:51,663
You don't know me like that. "
As I'm talking to him,

1344
01:02:51,697 --> 01:02:53,697
I'm like, "oh shit,
he's in a fighting stance.

1345
01:02:53,730 --> 01:02:55,763
Kev, he about to hit you.
Protect yourself.

1346
01:02:55,797 --> 01:02:57,897
Better yet, hit him first. "

1347
01:02:57,930 --> 01:02:59,997
I throw a punch.
Punched him right in the face.

1348
01:03:00,030 --> 01:03:01,897
Bow! Never hit nobody
in the face before.

1349
01:03:01,930 --> 01:03:03,963
I was excited.
I celebrated.

1350
01:03:03,997 --> 01:03:05,997
I was like, "yeah,
bitch. You don't want it.

1351
01:03:06,030 --> 01:03:07,830
Real niggas.
All day.

1352
01:03:07,863 --> 01:03:09,597
D- block. All day.

1353
01:03:09,630 --> 01:03:11,498
By myself.
Gun on my waist.

1354
01:03:11,597 --> 01:03:13,730
Smile on my face.
In jail.

1355
01:03:13,763 --> 01:03:15,630
One bed.
One blanket.

1356
01:03:15,663 --> 01:03:20,297
You wanna go
night night, nigga?

1357
01:03:20,797 --> 01:03:23,163
So now he tries
to tackle me.

1358
01:03:23,197 --> 01:03:25,063
As I'm in my speech,
he tackles me.

1359
01:03:25,097 --> 01:03:27,130
Why would you tackle me?
I'm small.

1360
01:03:27,163 --> 01:03:28,997
I got a low center of
gravity. I get him off me.

1361
01:03:29,030 --> 01:03:30,997
I start uppercutting him.
Mmm mmm mmm.

1362
01:03:31,030 --> 01:03:33,197
Whipping his ass.
He realizes that he's losing.

1363
01:03:33,230 --> 01:03:35,130
He tries to call
his security guard back.

1364
01:03:35,163 --> 01:03:37,097
"Thomas, Thomas,
come help. "

1365
01:03:37,130 --> 01:03:39,697
I look over.
Wayne, my security guard-

1366
01:03:39,730 --> 01:03:42,563
Wayne got a real big stomach.
Wayne had Thomas on the wall.

1367
01:03:42,630 --> 01:03:45,130
When I looked over,
This is exactly what I saw:

1368
01:03:45,163 --> 01:03:47,930
Wayne was like, "what you
doin'? Where you goin'?

1369
01:03:47,963 --> 01:03:50,630
No, what you doin'? Where
you gonna go? What you doin'?"

1370
01:03:50,663 --> 01:03:54,230
It didn't look good. I didn't
know if he was helping me

1371
01:03:54,263 --> 01:03:56,763
or helping his self.
I never brought it back up.

1372
01:03:56,797 --> 01:04:00,063
I didn't want to know.
So now reality has kicked in.

1373
01:04:00,097 --> 01:04:02,097
"Oh shit,
I'm in Dallas, Texas.

1374
01:04:02,130 --> 01:04:04,097
If I get arrested out here,
I'm not getting out of jail

1375
01:04:04,130 --> 01:04:06,097
till, like, Tuesday. "
I'm like, "yo, let's go.

1376
01:04:06,130 --> 01:04:08,930
Get the car. Nate,
get the car! Let's go!"

1377
01:04:08,963 --> 01:04:10,630
This is how I knew
Nate was O.G.

1378
01:04:10,663 --> 01:04:12,663
Nate got the car,
pulled the car up on the curb,

1379
01:04:12,697 --> 01:04:14,797
blocked the whole
curb off, right?

1380
01:04:14,830 --> 01:04:18,030
I've never seen Nate this hype
in my life. He was hype as shit.

1381
01:04:18,063 --> 01:04:20,563
He's like, "hey!
Get Kev in the car!

1382
01:04:20,597 --> 01:04:22,830
Hurry up, man!
Hurry up before the cops come.

1383
01:04:22,863 --> 01:04:25,563
Somebody grab his head, push his
head down so they don't see him. "

1384
01:04:25,597 --> 01:04:28,697
When he said that, I was like,
"oh shit. Nate used to be a killer.

1385
01:04:28,730 --> 01:04:30,597
How else would
he know what to do

1386
01:04:30,630 --> 01:04:32,630
in a situation like this?

1387
01:04:32,663 --> 01:04:35,130
I don't even know who he is anymore."
Then he snaps on me.

1388
01:04:35,163 --> 01:04:37,530
"I can't believe you, Kevin.
You got a career!

1389
01:04:37,563 --> 01:04:39,063
You doin' television,
you doin' movies.

1390
01:04:39,097 --> 01:04:41,098
You gonna jeopardize that shit
for a street fight?

1391
01:04:41,163 --> 01:04:42,963
That's stupid!
Let's go!

1392
01:04:42,997 --> 01:04:45,197
Hurry up, man!
Hurry up 'fore the cops come.

1393
01:04:45,230 --> 01:04:47,630
We don't have time. Y'all
wanna do what y'all wanna do.

1394
01:04:47,663 --> 01:04:50,630
We got to get the hell
out of here.

1395
01:04:50,663 --> 01:04:53,130
We don't have
this type of time. "

1396
01:04:59,797 --> 01:05:01,963
We never pulled off.
We got locked up on the spot.

1397
01:05:02,097 --> 01:05:04,963
Cleveland, I love y'all.
My name's Kev Hart. Thank you.
