here to live with your aunt.

that a bacala ate a big dog.

What's "bacala?"

It's a dry fish.

that first dance?

Because when you do that, 
then the woman, they feel the poetry,

That my whole life was out there somewhere.

874
01:14:06,108 --> 01:14:10,696
And then I don't know.

875
01:14:10,696 --> 01:14:20,456
One night, in one moment, my entire world

876
01:14:20,706 --> 01:14:24,585
my whole life is here.

877
01:14:24,585 --> 01:14:26,587
With you.

Beyond...thatâs where you are for me

879
01:14:32,342 --> 01:14:37,389

For me, just for me.

880
01:14:38,348 --> 01:14:46,440
[Italian Lyrics]
Beyond the deepest sea, thatâs where you are.

881
01:14:48,484 --> 01:14:52,571
Angelina I have a confession.

882
01:14:52,571 --> 01:14:56,200
I didn't write you that poem.

883
01:14:57,534 --> 01:15:00,204
I don't even speak Italian

884
01:15:00,621 --> 01:15:04,791
[Italian]
You didn't write me that poem?

885
01:15:08,587 --> 01:15:11,840
[Italian]
You didn't write me that poem?

886
01:15:12,716 --> 01:15:19,223
[Italian Lyrics]
Beyond...Beyond.

887
01:15:20,057 --> 01:15:22,476
[Song Ends]

888
01:15:24,019 --> 01:15:26,647
[Italian]
You're a phoney'?

889
01:15:28,565 --> 01:15:32,528
- Paolo! 
- Wh-ho's that?

890
01:15:32,528 --> 01:15:34,238
Angelina who's Paolo?

891
01:15:35,239 --> 01:15:37,032
[Italian]
My fiancÃ©

892
01:15:37,032 --> 01:15:39,868
You want to tell me what that is in English?

893
01:15:39,868 --> 01:15:44,289
[Italian] 
You don't speak Italian? You didn't write me that poem?

894
01:15:44,289 --> 01:15:46,416
I don't speak Italian.

895
01:15:46,416 --> 01:15:49,253
Evero, no parle Italiano.

896
01:15:49,503 --> 01:15:52,047
Angelina,he's your FiancÃ©?

897
01:15:52,047 --> 01:15:55,300
Liar! Phoney!

898
01:15:55,425 --> 01:15:57,886
Whoa! Whoa whoa!

899
01:16:01,890 --> 01:16:03,850
I wish I were in hell with my back broken
with my back.

900
01:16:09,064 --> 01:16:10,399
I'm a liar?

901
01:16:10,399 --> 01:16:11,942
You went out with me and you're engaged?

902
01:16:12,317 --> 01:16:14,444
You are the deceiver!

903
01:16:19,700 --> 01:16:21,159
[Italian]
Come with me!

904
01:16:33,922 --> 01:16:38,093
This isn't there way I thought it would play

905
01:16:52,316 --> 01:16:53,609
Thanks for helping me with the list, buddy.

906
01:16:54,985 --> 01:16:57,446
Hey, catch one I'll let you have it.

907
01:17:01,950 --> 01:17:06,455
Hey, how was your date? I was just about to
ask her to marry me!

908
01:17:06,455 --> 01:17:08,707
And... And her fiancee showed up.

909
01:17:08,707 --> 01:17:09,750
And... We got in a fight.

910
01:17:10,125 --> 01:17:12,961
That's great! Did you consider the lips?

911
01:17:13,253 --> 01:17:15,088
No. Too bad.

912
01:17:15,339 --> 01:17:17,007
Well, you must really feel like an asshole.

913
01:17:19,009 --> 01:17:21,303
It'll probably make you a better writer,though.

914
01:17:21,303 --> 01:17:23,889
You're damn right it will!

915
01:17:23,889 --> 01:17:25,015
I can't believe I let here get under my skin like that.

916
01:17:25,265 --> 01:17:27,559
What a fool I was! I know!

917
01:17:27,559 --> 01:17:29,061
You know what, it's like I had the flu.

918
01:17:29,061 --> 01:17:31,146
I was sick and now I'm better.

919
01:17:31,146 --> 01:17:32,773
I'm immune. Amen!

920
01:17:32,773 --> 01:17:34,983
Everything's cleared up. And just enough time
for me to go on my trip.

921
01:17:35,776 --> 01:17:38,320
And then you can help me finish the rest of 
my list before my wedding.

922
01:17:38,945 --> 01:17:41,490
Ya ya - as soon as I'm done with this last story.

923
01:17:54,878 --> 01:17:56,797
[Italian] 
How would I translate, "I forgive you".

924
01:17:56,797 --> 01:17:58,173
I will forgive you.

925
01:18:00,467 --> 01:18:02,427
I will forgive you.

926
01:18:03,095 --> 01:18:08,642
[Italian]
In part, Because I let you come here alone!

927
01:18:09,768 --> 01:18:11,478
I'm sorry, Paolo.

928
01:18:12,062 --> 01:18:17,234
"I'm sorry. I'm Sorry". What does this mean, "Im sorry!"

929
01:18:17,317 --> 01:18:19,861
I'm sorry means I'm sorry.

930
01:18:19,861 --> 01:18:22,364
[Italian]
Here in America, everyone says, "I'm sorry!"

931
01:18:22,364 --> 01:18:25,992
[Italian] 
OK, enough! We'll talk tomorrow.

932
01:18:27,077 --> 01:18:29,162
[Italian]
Think about it.

933
01:18:29,579 --> 01:18:30,789
OK.

934
01:18:33,083 --> 01:18:34,292
...Angeli.

935
01:18:39,005 --> 01:18:40,590
oh bella.

936
01:18:40,590 --> 01:18:42,801
Ok. Ok.

937
01:18:48,390 --> 01:18:50,434
Brute!

938
01:20:09,012 --> 01:20:12,641
Yeah, yeah, I'm coming, I'm
coming, I'm coming

01:20:12,641 --> 01:20:18,188
Shut up, you're making my
head explode

Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

Oh, my God, it's the wedding!

943
01:20:32,160 --> 01:20:33,703
Yes,Helen, go on. Sure.

944
01:20:33,954 --> 01:20:35,080
We'll be ready in one hour.

945
01:20:35,247 --> 01:20:37,749
Oh, the the place was hardly touched at all.

946
01:20:38,375 --> 01:20:42,462
One hour to go for a very happy wedding in a
very clean place.

947
01:20:42,879 --> 01:20:44,798
Yes dearest. Uh huh. Right.

948
01:20:45,090 --> 01:20:46,424
Oh, my God.

949
01:20:46,424 --> 01:20:49,845
Just put them there. Helen, you know the
rule.

950
01:20:50,345 --> 01:20:54,724
The bride and groom shouldn't really talk on
a cell phone on the day of the wedding.

951
01:20:55,225 --> 01:20:56,851
Yeah, it's just bad luck.

952
01:20:57,644 --> 01:21:01,189
Helen, I promise you, it's a very famous
custom.

953
01:21:01,189 --> 01:21:07,946
Helen. I just want to know that no matter
what happens today, I love you, OK?

954
01:21:08,321 --> 01:21:12,242
OK then, bye. Mike Wake up!

I came to wish you very good luck on your
wedding day.

963
01:21:58,330 --> 01:21:59,914
Is there anything...

964
01:22:02,834 --> 01:22:03,710
Oh, dear.

965
01:22:03,918 --> 01:22:06,880
We still have a bit of tidying to do.

966

Jack darling.

967
01:22:13,303 --> 01:22:17,098
I know that you want your wedding day to be

968
01:22:17,349 --> 01:22:21,102
as beautiful, memorable as it can be, don't you?

969
01:22:21,561 --> 01:22:23,480
I Think we can achieve one of those?

970
01:22:23,480 --> 01:22:30,779
So how would it be if we had your
wedding in my apartment?

971
01:22:31,863 --> 01:22:33,531
You would do that?

972
01:22:33,823 --> 01:22:35,450
That's wonderful!

973
01:22:35,659 --> 01:22:37,327

- In my purse.

Oh, the house will seem so empty without you.

I will miss you so much.

What's this?

982
01:23:43,351 --> 01:23:48,857
Don't touch it, it's not yours.
It's something I'm going to get rid of.

01:24:41,993 --> 01:24:44,329
Sorry I wasn't there to do all that list stuff .

984
01:24:44,579 --> 01:24:47,207
I guess I'm not much of a best man.

985
01:24:48,708 --> 01:24:52,712
Mike. I never got Helen the Valentine I
promised her for the wedding.

986
01:24:53,171 --> 01:24:55,548
Can I use your poem? She'll love it.

987
01:24:55,548 --> 01:24:58,510
I don't know, Jack. My poem?

988
01:24:58,510 --> 01:25:01,763
You could save my life, Best Man.

Save your buddy's life.

It's the last thing on the list.

991
01:25:07,894 --> 01:25:10,480
All right, but this is your wedding present.

992
01:25:10,480 --> 01:25:11,731
Thanks, Mike.

993
01:25:13,274 --> 01:25:17,320
For now, we see through a glass darkly, 
but then face to face.

994
01:25:17,320 --> 01:25:22,158
Now I know in part, but then shall I know
even as also I am known

995

And now abideth faith, hope and love.
These three of the greatest of these is love.

- What are you doing here? 
- The door was open.

Waiting.

1011
01:26:48,494 --> 01:26:50,622
You must take back your poem

1012
01:26:51,623 --> 01:26:54,083
I didn't write it. I didn't give it to you, I don't want it.

1013
01:26:54,083 --> 01:26:56,377
Just take back your poem.

- I don't have time for this. 
- Mike stop. Mike!

1015
01:27:00,548 --> 01:27:03,676
- You're going to take this back right now.
- Why should I? It's not even my poem?

1016
01:27:03,968 --> 01:27:07,555
- You deceived me.
- Why didn't you tell me you were engaged?

1017
01:27:07,931 --> 01:27:09,599
Just take back your poem.

I don't know where he is...I don't know!

- Just Take back your... 
- I don't have time for this!

1020
01:27:19,692 --> 01:27:21,194

With this ring, I thee wed.

With this ring, I thee wed.

1023
01:27:50,223 --> 01:27:56,229
At this point in the ceremony, Jack wishes to
express his personal vow of love to Helen.

1024
01:27:58,356 --> 01:28:01,651
I wanted to buy Helen the greatest Valentine
I could find.

1025
01:28:01,651 --> 01:28:05,196
But there was nothing anywhere that could
express what I wanted to express.

1026
01:28:06,114 --> 01:28:11,327
Then when I had just about given up, I found
the greatest valentine of all...

1027
01:28:11,661 --> 01:28:16,708
A poem that my best friend and best man
wrote just last night.

1028
01:28:20,670 --> 01:28:24,590
From the moment you danced me into your
eyes, I who could not dance

1029
01:28:25,049 --> 01:28:27,260
I've heard a rhythm in my soul.

1030
01:28:27,260 --> 01:28:31,222
From the moment you spoke me into your lips,
I who could not speak

1031
01:28:31,222 --> 01:28:34,267
I have understood a new language.

1032
01:28:34,267 --> 01:28:37,937
The moment you touched my heart,
 I who could not reach.

1033
01:28:37,937 --> 01:28:44,068
I have felt more than ever before, there is a
man inside of me, who holds no deception.

1034
01:28:44,068 --> 01:28:48,156
Imprisoned in the fear of losing you, he
lacked the courage to reach.

1035

[Italian]
Let's go.

1036
01:28:49,824 --> 01:28:52,410

Goodbye, Kitty.

01:29:03,838 --> 01:29:10,595
This man inside of me will, for a kiss, be
yours from this moment 'til eternity.

1039
01:29:11,929 --> 01:29:15,433
In moment of the kiss, in the moment of the kiss.

01:29:37,747 --> 01:29:39,749
Please don't go.

1045
01:29:40,333 --> 01:29:43,503
[Italian]
Angelina. Come here. Now!

1046
01:29:45,296 --> 01:29:48,966
Angelina... I love you.

1047
01:29:49,884 --> 01:29:52,678
Angelina. You made a vow.

1048
01:30:02,855 --> 01:30:04,524
Angelina!

1049
01:30:15,535 --> 01:30:17,954
I am sorry Paolo!

1050
01:30:19,622 --> 01:30:23,209
[Romantic Song]
"Al Di La"

1051
01:30:41,727 --> 01:30:56,784
[Italian Lyrics]
I did not believe I could ever say these words:

1052
01:30:58,077 --> 01:31:02,748
[Italian Lyrics]
Beyond the most precious, thatâs where you are.

1053
01:31:03,749 --> 01:31:06,919
Ah, there is nothing like a wedding.

1054
01:31:09,005 --> 01:31:13,050
It makes it all seem so worthwhile.

1055
01:31:13,342 --> 01:31:16,804
[Italian Lyrics]
Beyond the most ambitious, thatâs where you are.

1056
01:31:17,263 --> 01:31:21,559
Boy meets girl, girl meets boy.

1057
01:31:22,852 --> 01:31:25,479
The eternal story.

1058
01:31:25,855 --> 01:31:32,153
[Italian Lyrics]
Beyond the stars, thatâs where you are.

1059
01:31:33,029 --> 01:31:37,492
[Italian Lyrics]
Beyond, thatâs where you are for me

1060
01:31:37,492 --> 01:31:41,579
[Italian Lyrics]
For me, just for me.

1061
01:31:43,372 --> 01:31:46,792
Perhaps I'll see you again sometime.

1062
01:31:47,126 --> 01:31:53,007
Perhaps I'll send YOU a Valentine

1063
01:31:55,051 --> 01:32:01,974
[Italian Lyrics]
Beyond the limits of the world, thatâs where you are.

1064
01:32:04,977 --> 01:32:10,733
[Italian Lyrics]
Beyond infinite time, beyond life

1065
01:32:11,984 --> 01:32:15,488
