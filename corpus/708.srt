2
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,240
They say Japan was made
by a sword.

3
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:34,770
They say the old gods dipped
a coral blade into the ocean...

4
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:39,750
...and when they pulled it out,
four perfect drops fell back into the sea...

5
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:43,380
...and those drops became
the islands of Japan.

6
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:49,460
I say Japan was made
by a handful of brave men...

7
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:53,560
... warriors willing to give their lives...

8
00:00:53,730 --> 00:00:56,430
...for what seems to have become
a forgotten word:.

9
00:00:57,770 --> 00:00:59,100
Honor.

10
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:57,860
Ladies and gentlemen :
Winchester.

11
00:01:58,030 --> 00:02:02,330
America' s leader in all forms of armament
used by the United States Army...

12
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:07,400
...celebrates our nation's centennial
by bringing you a true American hero.

13
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:12,670
One of the most decorated warriors
this country has ever known.

14
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:15,510
Winner of the Medal of Honor...

15
00:02:15,710 --> 00:02:19,440
...for his gallantry
on the hallowed ground of Gettysburg.

16
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:22,450
He is late of the 7th Cavalry...

17
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:26,750
...and their triumphant campaign against
the most savage of the lndian nations.

18
00:02:26,990 --> 00:02:31,260
Ladies and gentlemen,
I present to you:

19
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:34,560
Captain Nathan Algren!

20
00:02:41,710 --> 00:02:45,970
Captain Nathan Algren!

21
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:47,980
Yes!

22
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:49,140
Yes!

23
00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:53,540
One moment,
ladies and gentlemen.

24
00:02:56,290 --> 00:02:58,590
Goddamn you, Algren,
get out there!

25
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:02,950
This is your last performance!
You're fired! Now get out there!

26
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:07,090
Come on! I'm sick of this!

27
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:08,590
Come on!

28
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:10,890
Yes!

29
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:22,180
My thanks, Mr. McCabe,
you are too kind.

30
00:03:24,020 --> 00:03:26,880
This, ladies and gents...

31
00:03:27,050 --> 00:03:30,110
...is the gun that's winning the West.

32
00:03:30,290 --> 00:03:33,450
Why, many's the time I've found myself...

33
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:38,690
...surrounded by a swarm of...

34
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:42,930
...angry hostiles...

35
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:45,760
...with nothing but this rifle...

36
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:50,600
...between me and a certain
and gruesome death.

37
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:54,040
And let me tell you, folks,
the red man...

38
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:57,280
...is a fearsome enemy.

39
00:03:57,450 --> 00:03:59,210
And if he'd had his way...

40
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:02,720
...why, this scalp of mine
would be long gone...

41
00:04:02,890 --> 00:04:06,480
...and there'd be a balder man
standing before you today.

42
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:14,960
Like those poor bastards out there...

43
00:04:15,670 --> 00:04:17,760
...on the Little Bighorn.

44
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:22,000
Bodies stripped bare...

45
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:25,100
...mutilated.

46
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:28,840
Left to rot in the sun.

47
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:37,420
This, ladies and gentlemen,
the 73 lever-action...

48
00:04:37,790 --> 00:04:39,420
...Trapper.

49
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:44,190
It's got a seven-shot capacity.
Accurate 400 yards, one round per second.

50
00:04:44,830 --> 00:04:47,730
Son, have you ever seen
what this could do to a man?.

51
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:50,770
This would blow a hole
in your daddy six inches wide.

52
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:52,270
That's right, missy.

53
00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:54,340
This beauty.

54
00:04:54,510 --> 00:04:59,000
You could kill yourself five, six, seven
braves without ever having to reload.

55
00:04:59,180 --> 00:05:03,050
Note the patented loading port
and the smooth cocking action.

56
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:23,030
My thanks on behalf
of those who died...

57
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:26,830
...in the name of better
mechanical amusements...

58
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:29,330
...and commercial opportunities.

59
00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:32,970
Mr. McCabe here will take your orders.

60
00:05:33,340 --> 00:05:35,470
God bless you all.

61
00:05:43,190 --> 00:05:46,520
I must say, captain, you have a flair
for the old melodrama.

62
00:05:46,690 --> 00:05:49,990
-You're alive.
-I am, indeed.

63
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:54,260
Your man Custer says to me,
""We're going to the Little Bighorn.""

64
00:05:54,430 --> 00:05:57,830
Says l, ""What's this 'we' stuff?. ""
It's the walking ticket for me.

65
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,800
Nine lives I have.
But I'll tell you what else I have.

66
00:06:00,970 --> 00:06:02,960
I have a good job for the both of us.

67
00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:05,800
God knows it looks
as if you'll need one real soon.

68
00:06:05,980 --> 00:06:08,000
What kind of a job?.

69
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:12,980
The only job you're fit for, boyo.
A man's job.

70
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:18,020
Unless, of course, you got your heart
set on a career in the theater.

71
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,750
Nathan!

72
00:06:23,930 --> 00:06:26,230
Just listen to what
your man has to say.

73
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,390
Been a while.
It's good to see you.

74
00:06:28,970 --> 00:06:31,490
I'd like you to meet
Mr. Omura from Japan...

75
00:06:31,670 --> 00:06:35,660
...and his associate, whose name
I've given up trying to pronounce.

76
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:36,970
Sit down, please.

77
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:44,040
Whiskey.

78
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:49,680
Now, Japan's got it in mind
to become a civilized country.

79
00:06:49,850 --> 00:06:52,720
And Mr. Omura here is willing
to spend what it takes...

80
00:06:52,890 --> 00:06:55,590
...to hire white experts
to train their army.

81
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:57,730
And if we play our cards right...

82
00:06:57,900 --> 00:07:01,520
...the Emperor grants the U.S.
exclusive rights to supply arms.

83
00:07:07,910 --> 00:07:11,400
Well, I have an agreement
with Winchester Company.

84
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:14,880
I'm certain Mr. Omura has some concept
of what an agreement is.

85
00:07:15,110 --> 00:07:20,480
Your performances for the Winchester
Company bring you $25 a week.

86
00:07:20,650 --> 00:07:23,310
We will pay you $400 a month.

87
00:07:28,290 --> 00:07:30,850
Five. For each.

88
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:35,520
And another 500
when we get the job done.

89
00:07:36,370 --> 00:07:40,570
How many other genuine heroes
you got lined up?.

90
00:07:47,980 --> 00:07:48,970
Whiskey.

91
00:07:49,150 --> 00:07:52,010
So who will we be training
your boys to fight?.

92
00:07:52,450 --> 00:07:56,750
His name is Katsumoto Moritsugu.
He was once the Emperor's teacher.

93
00:07:57,620 --> 00:08:00,090
-He's Samurai.
-Samurai?.

94
00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:02,590
The word you might use is ""warrior.""

95
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:06,360
Mr. Omura is familiar with our experiences
dealing with renegades.

96
00:08:06,530 --> 00:08:08,430
Is he?.

97
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:10,260
He's even read your book.

98
00:08:10,430 --> 00:08:12,560
Captain Algren's study of the tribes...

99
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:15,670
...was a crucial factor
in our defeat of the Cheyenne.

100
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:31,580
Please excuse. What is funny?.

101
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:38,350
The corps back together again.
It's just so...

102
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,560
...inspiring!

103
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:48,230
Excuse me.

104
00:08:51,210 --> 00:08:53,770
I need to use the necessities.

105
00:08:57,250 --> 00:09:00,340
This isn't a problem.
I'll just talk to him for a minute.

106
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:02,010
Colonel Bagley.

107
00:09:02,190 --> 00:09:05,780
We contacted you because you are
Captain Algren's superior officer...

108
00:09:05,990 --> 00:09:08,420
...and you assured us
of his participation.

109
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:11,820
He'll do it.
I just need a minute.

110
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:15,760
Nathan.

111
00:09:17,670 --> 00:09:20,540
I did what I was ordered
to do out there.

112
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:22,600
And I have no remorse.

113
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:26,640
So, what do you say we
put the past behind us?.

114
00:09:30,450 --> 00:09:34,710
-You want me to kill Jappos, I'll kill them.
-I'm not asking you to kill anybody.

115
00:09:34,890 --> 00:09:38,620
You want me to kill the enemies of Jappos,
I'll kill their enemies.

116
00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:42,490
Rebs or Sioux or Cheyenne....

117
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:46,150
For 500 bucks a month,
I'll kill whoever you want.

118
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:48,720
But keep one thing in mind...

119
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:53,170
...I'd happily kill you for free.

120
00:10:08,850 --> 00:10:11,550
July 12th, 1876.

121
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:14,320
There is some comfort
in the emptiness of the sea.

122
00:10:15,430 --> 00:10:18,950
No past, no future.

123
00:10:21,030 --> 00:10:25,160
And then at once, I am confronted
by the hard truth of present circumstances.

124
00:10:28,510 --> 00:10:33,500
I have been hired to help suppress
the rebellion of yet another tribal leader.

125
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:37,410
Apparently, this is the only job
for which I am suited.

126
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:43,690
I am beset by the ironies of my life.

127
00:11:53,890 --> 00:11:56,260
-Captain Algren, I presume?.
-Yes.

128
00:11:56,430 --> 00:11:58,860
Jolly good. How do you do?.
Simon Graham.

129
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:02,560
Twenty years ago,
this was a sleepy little town.

130
00:12:02,730 --> 00:12:04,030
Now look at it.

131
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:07,430
You see, the Emperor is mad
for all things Western...

132
00:12:07,610 --> 00:12:10,630
...and the Samurai believe
it's changing too fast.

133
00:12:10,810 --> 00:12:13,870
The ancient and the modern
are at war for the soul of Japan.

134
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:17,040
So your new employer, Mr. Omura,
is bringing in...

135
00:12:17,210 --> 00:12:19,440
...every Western expert he can get.

136
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:23,520
Lawyers from France, engineers from
Germany, architects from Holland...

137
00:12:23,690 --> 00:12:27,120
...and now, of course,
warriors from America.

138
00:12:27,290 --> 00:12:31,850
I came over with the British
trade mission, oh, years ago.

139
00:12:32,030 --> 00:12:33,890
I was soon relieved of my position.

140
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:36,660
I had an unfortunate tendency
to tell the truth...

141
00:12:36,830 --> 00:12:39,630
...in a country where no one ever
says what they mean.

142
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:44,170
So now, I very accurately translate
other people's lies.

143
00:12:49,450 --> 00:12:52,640
For 2000 years, no emperor
was even seen by a commoner.

144
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:57,380
You have to realize what an honor this is.
It's all highly ritualized, of course.

145
00:12:57,560 --> 00:13:00,420
You may look at him,
but do not speak unless spoken to.

146
00:13:00,590 --> 00:13:04,580
If he stands, you must bow.
If he bows, you must bow lower.

147
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:07,820
Do I look presentable?.
I haven't worn this in a decade.

148
00:13:08,830 --> 00:13:11,170
Rather snug around the midriff.

149
00:13:26,420 --> 00:13:28,180
And bow.

150
00:13:29,450 --> 00:13:32,390
The divine Emperor Meiji
bids you welcome.

151
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:35,790
He is grateful for the assistance
your country offers.

152
00:13:36,460 --> 00:13:41,660
We hope to accomplish the same national
harmony you enjoy in your homeland.

153
00:13:49,340 --> 00:13:52,400
The Emperor is most interested
in your American lndians...

154
00:13:52,580 --> 00:13:54,980
...if you have fought
against them in battle.

155
00:13:55,150 --> 00:13:58,270
We have, Your Highness.
The red man is a brutal adversary.

156
00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:08,960
The Emperor wishes
to ask Captain Algren...

157
00:14:09,130 --> 00:14:11,820
...if it is true they wear eagle feathers...

158
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,060
...and paint their faces
before going into battle...

159
00:14:15,230 --> 00:14:17,430
...and that they have no fear.

160
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:22,340
They are very brave.

161
00:14:30,950 --> 00:14:32,440
Bow.

162
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:44,020
Thank you very much.

163
00:14:54,970 --> 00:14:57,770
And step back.

164
00:14:58,980 --> 00:15:03,380
Step back, step back and turn.

165
00:15:06,450 --> 00:15:08,850
Right, you little bastards!

166
00:15:09,020 --> 00:15:12,680
You will stand up straight
or I will personally shit-kick...

167
00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:16,350
...every Far Eastern buttock
that appears before my eyes!

168
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:20,250
Well done, sergeant.

169
00:15:20,430 --> 00:15:23,660
When you understand the language,
everything falls into place.

170
00:15:23,930 --> 00:15:26,630
The first rank will kneel,
rifles at the ready.

171
00:15:28,210 --> 00:15:29,190
The second rank....

172
00:15:29,370 --> 00:15:32,370
July 22nd, 1876.

173
00:15:33,210 --> 00:15:37,810
For six months ' work, I am to receive
three years of captain 's pay...

174
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:40,610
...teaching Orientals to soldier.

175
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:44,810
They are an army of conscripts.

176
00:15:44,990 --> 00:15:47,980
Most of them are peasants
who have never even seen a gun.

177
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:49,790
Fire!

178
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:54,430
They are led by General Hasegawa,
a man of small stature...

179
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:57,400
... who nonetheless commands
enormous respect.

180
00:15:57,570 --> 00:16:01,560
What can the general tell me about
this man, this Samurai, Katsumoto?.

181
00:16:06,710 --> 00:16:10,170
He seems to have great knowledge
of Katsumoto and his rebellion.

182
00:16:10,350 --> 00:16:12,870
I will count on his help
when facing the Samurai.

183
00:16:13,050 --> 00:16:14,880
Who supplies their weapons?.

184
00:16:22,830 --> 00:16:26,520
Katsumoto no longer dishonors himself
by using firearms, you see.

185
00:16:27,230 --> 00:16:28,700
He uses no firearms?.

186
00:16:28,870 --> 00:16:31,770
To those who honor the old ways,
Katsumoto is a hero.

187
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:33,700
How well does he know him?.

188
00:16:33,870 --> 00:16:37,100
The general and Katsumoto
fought together for the Emperor.

189
00:16:37,270 --> 00:16:38,710
He fought with the Samurai?.

190
00:16:41,450 --> 00:16:42,610
He is Samurai.

191
00:16:49,390 --> 00:16:53,760
You must understand. Katsumoto pledged
his sword to defend the Emperor.

192
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:56,620
They say that a Samurai's sword
is his soul.

193
00:16:56,790 --> 00:17:01,630
Samurai are paradoxical. I've tried to write
about them, but they keep to themselves.

194
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:04,320
The bastards are still wearing armor.

195
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:07,700
When the lrish were comporting
themselves in loincloths...

196
00:17:07,870 --> 00:17:11,070
...these chaps were the most
sophisticated warriors on Earth.

197
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:13,370
I need information
on their battle tactics.

198
00:17:13,580 --> 00:17:16,670
I have several more books
just waiting to be translated.

199
00:17:16,850 --> 00:17:21,280
He'll be speaking the lingo in no time.
You should hear him blather on in Blackfoot.

200
00:17:21,450 --> 00:17:22,940
Really?.

201
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:25,920
A fellow linguist?. Oh, capital!

202
00:17:26,090 --> 00:17:29,320
Come on, sir.
A word or two in the savage tongue.

203
00:17:29,490 --> 00:17:33,020
Just ""hello"" or ""goodbye"" or--
No, no, no!

204
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:35,670
""Cut his tongue out
and boil him in oil.""

205
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:40,200
Early day tomorrow, captain.

206
00:17:40,370 --> 00:17:44,240
-It's about bedtime, isn't it?.
-I always had a fascination with scalping.

207
00:17:44,410 --> 00:17:47,240
I never quite understood
its technique.

208
00:17:52,350 --> 00:17:56,790
Imagine someone who hates you
with the utmost intensity...

209
00:17:57,090 --> 00:18:01,960
...grabbing a handful of your hair
while you're lying prostrate and helpless...

210
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:11,330
...and scraping a dull blade
of a rusty knife around your scalp...

211
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:13,800
...with a saw-like motion.

212
00:18:14,610 --> 00:18:19,570
And let your imagination grasp, if you can,
the effect of a strong, quick jerk...

213
00:18:20,910 --> 00:18:24,240
...on the turf of your hair
to release any clinging particles...

214
00:18:24,410 --> 00:18:27,180
...would have on your nervous system.

215
00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:35,090
And you'll have some idea
of how it feels to be scalped...

216
00:18:35,260 --> 00:18:36,420
...Mr. Graham.

217
00:18:43,330 --> 00:18:45,390
How soon can you
translate those books?.

218
00:18:47,810 --> 00:18:49,600
Right away.

219
00:18:51,580 --> 00:18:55,200
I'm just delighted you're taking
such an interest in Samurai.

220
00:18:55,380 --> 00:18:58,780
I don't give a damn about the Samurai.
I want to know my enemy.

221
00:18:58,950 --> 00:19:02,390
I shall not sleep until it is done.

222
00:19:04,890 --> 00:19:06,380
Sake.

223
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:09,160
I bid you good night.

224
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:11,450
Can I get you anything?.

225
00:19:11,630 --> 00:19:13,690
This is a punitive expedition, captain.

226
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:17,030
Col. Bagley, these people had
nothing to do with the raids!

227
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:19,800
-Good night, sir.
-Quietly now, boys.

228
00:20:05,550 --> 00:20:06,780
Fire!

229
00:20:16,330 --> 00:20:19,630
We should be grateful they're all firing
in the same direction.

230
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:22,060
Couldn't have put it better myself, sir.

231
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:28,810
Rifle butt, against the shoulder.

232
00:20:30,540 --> 00:20:33,010
Eye, down the sight.

233
00:20:33,340 --> 00:20:34,870
Now, slowly....

234
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:41,410
Well done.

235
00:20:42,690 --> 00:20:44,280
Nathan!

236
00:20:48,190 --> 00:20:51,420
Katsumoto's attacked a railroad
at the border of his province.

237
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:54,790
We cannot govern a country
in which we cannot travel freely.

238
00:20:54,970 --> 00:20:56,190
He must be stopped now.

239
00:20:56,370 --> 00:20:59,960
My railroad is a priority
for this country.

240
00:21:00,470 --> 00:21:01,460
They're not ready.

241
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:05,440
The rebels don't have any rifles.
They're savages with bows and arrows.

242
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:09,240
Whose sole occupation for the last
thousand years has been war.

243
00:21:09,410 --> 00:21:13,180
You have superior firepower
and a larger force.

244
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:16,890
I am ordering the regiment
to move against Katsumoto.

245
00:21:17,050 --> 00:21:20,390
You will track him down
and engage him.

246
00:21:24,060 --> 00:21:25,220
Load.

247
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:28,760
Mr. Graham!
Tell this man to fire at me!

248
00:21:28,930 --> 00:21:32,420
-I beg your pardon?.
-Tell this man...

249
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:36,160
...if he does not shoot me,
I will kill him!

250
00:21:37,170 --> 00:21:40,440
-Captain, if I might have a word.
-Tell him!

251
00:21:42,010 --> 00:21:43,600
Tell him!

252
00:21:49,690 --> 00:21:51,280
Load!

253
00:21:55,230 --> 00:21:56,990
Load!

254
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:01,220
Faster!

255
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:03,790
Faster!

256
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:10,800
Shoot me, damn it.

257
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:16,970
Fire!

258
00:22:19,050 --> 00:22:20,240
Fire!

259
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:48,110
They're not ready.

260
00:22:51,010 --> 00:22:53,570
The regiment leaves at 6 a.m.!

261
00:23:24,610 --> 00:23:28,520
A thousand miles of rail track laid
in less than two years.

262
00:23:28,690 --> 00:23:30,350
It's astonishing.

263
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:32,610
And Omura owns all of it?.

264
00:23:32,790 --> 00:23:35,780
As soon as he can get rid
of the Samurai, he will, yes.

265
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:38,480
How do you intend
to find Katsumoto?.

266
00:23:38,660 --> 00:23:43,190
Don't worry, Mr. Graham.
I assure you, he'll find us.

267
00:23:54,210 --> 00:23:56,680
Move into position!

268
00:23:56,850 --> 00:23:59,510
1 st Company,
form a battle line on me!

269
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:01,650
Pay attention,
it will save your life!

270
00:24:01,820 --> 00:24:04,450
2nd Company,
form on 1 st Company.

271
00:24:04,620 --> 00:24:06,950
3rd and 4th Company,
form up behind.

272
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:08,650
Fill in on command!

273
00:24:08,830 --> 00:24:12,660
-Where's Hasegawa?.
-He refuses to fight against Katsumoto.

274
00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:18,170
-Cover down!
-Captain Algren.

275
00:24:18,870 --> 00:24:20,270
We are not here as combatants.

276
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:23,070
-Then who's gonna lead them?.
-Their own officers.

277
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:26,040
-Let's move to the rear.
-We'll be there presently.

278
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:27,740
Fix bayonets!

279
00:24:32,020 --> 00:24:36,380
-Mr. Graham, accompany me to the rear.
-Yes, of course.

280
00:24:40,990 --> 00:24:46,090
Sergeant Gant, report to the rear and see
to the disposition of the supply trains.

281
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:49,120
-Did you hear my order?.
-I did indeed, sir!

282
00:24:49,300 --> 00:24:51,630
Then you will obey it. Now!

283
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:55,200
No disrespect intended, sir,
but shove it up your ass.

284
00:25:00,580 --> 00:25:02,440
-Load!
-Load!

285
00:25:31,070 --> 00:25:32,230
Samurai come.

286
00:25:34,310 --> 00:25:35,470
You'll be fine, son.

287
00:25:53,630 --> 00:25:56,100
-Assume firing positions!
-Assume firing positions!

288
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:12,110
Fire on my order only!

289
00:26:33,870 --> 00:26:35,240
Hold your fire!

290
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:37,070
Hold your fire!

291
00:26:44,380 --> 00:26:46,010
Reload!

292
00:26:50,390 --> 00:26:52,050
Hold the line!

293
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:55,550
Fire at will!

294
00:27:11,710 --> 00:27:13,110
Lieutenant, fall back!

295
00:27:56,490 --> 00:27:57,920
Zeb!

296
00:32:25,050 --> 00:32:26,420
What is your name?.

297
00:32:54,380 --> 00:32:56,180
This is my son's village.

298
00:32:56,350 --> 00:33:00,050
We are deep in the mountains
and winter is coming. You cannot escape.

299
00:33:03,190 --> 00:33:04,960
Jolly good.

300
00:35:56,530 --> 00:35:57,760
Sake.

301
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:00,990
Sake?.

302
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:03,430
Sake.

303
00:36:10,810 --> 00:36:12,110
Sake.

304
00:36:14,380 --> 00:36:15,910
Sake.

305
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:17,470
Sake.

306
00:37:20,220 --> 00:37:21,270
Sake!

307
00:37:34,530 --> 00:37:35,960
Please.

308
00:37:36,370 --> 00:37:37,860
Sake.

309
00:37:47,510 --> 00:37:49,980
Sake!

310
00:37:56,450 --> 00:37:59,290
No!

311
00:38:00,460 --> 00:38:02,520
No!

312
00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:09,400
I told you!

313
00:38:16,340 --> 00:38:18,710
No!

314
00:39:02,420 --> 00:39:03,820
Morning.

315
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,700
Go. You, go.

316
00:41:01,100 --> 00:41:02,760
What's your name?.

317
00:41:03,340 --> 00:41:05,240
You got a name, don't you?.

318
00:41:09,250 --> 00:41:11,650
You don't know what I'm saying, do you?.

319
00:41:13,020 --> 00:41:14,510
I know why you don't talk.

320
00:41:15,850 --> 00:41:17,510
You're angry.

321
00:41:17,690 --> 00:41:20,710
You're angry because
they make you wear a dress.

322
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:23,550
Son of a bitch.

323
00:42:02,830 --> 00:42:06,490
This temple was built by my family
a thousand years ago.

324
00:42:08,900 --> 00:42:11,460
My name is Katsumoto.

325
00:42:11,710 --> 00:42:14,510
What is your name?.

326
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:23,320
Are my words not correct?.

327
00:42:27,860 --> 00:42:30,760
I will practice my English with you...

328
00:42:32,230 --> 00:42:34,090
...if you would honor me.

329
00:42:35,900 --> 00:42:38,030
You kept me alive just to speak English?.

330
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:42,030
Then what do you want?.

331
00:42:43,340 --> 00:42:44,640
To know my enemy.

332
00:42:46,180 --> 00:42:48,870
I've seen what you do to your enemies.

333
00:42:49,210 --> 00:42:51,200
Warriors in your country do not kill?.

334
00:42:51,380 --> 00:42:54,650
They don't cut the heads off defeated,
kneeling men.

335
00:42:55,680 --> 00:42:59,380
General Hasegawa asked me
to help him end his life.

336
00:43:00,920 --> 00:43:04,290
A Samurai cannot stand
the shame of defeat.

337
00:43:05,030 --> 00:43:07,220
I was honored to cut off his head.

338
00:43:10,300 --> 00:43:15,130
Many of our customs seem strange to you.
The same is true of yours.

339
00:43:15,300 --> 00:43:16,830
For example...

340
00:43:17,010 --> 00:43:21,970
...not to introduce yourself is considered
extremely rude, even among enemies.

341
00:43:28,780 --> 00:43:30,550
Nathan Algren.

342
00:43:33,120 --> 00:43:35,490
I am honored to meet you.

343
00:43:36,090 --> 00:43:40,030
-I have enjoyed this conversation in English.
-I have questions.

344
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:43,860
I have introduced myself.
You have introduced yourself.

345
00:43:44,030 --> 00:43:46,160
This is a very good conversation.

346
00:43:46,870 --> 00:43:48,730
-I have questions.
-They come later.

347
00:43:48,900 --> 00:43:51,300
Who was the warrior in the red armor?.

348
00:43:52,270 --> 00:43:55,940
-My brother-in-law, Hirotaro.
-And the woman who cares for me?.

349
00:43:56,250 --> 00:43:58,980
My sister, Hirotaro's wife.

350
00:43:59,150 --> 00:44:00,710
Her name is Taka.

351
00:44:01,050 --> 00:44:02,280
I killed her husband?.

352
00:44:04,220 --> 00:44:06,410
It was a good death.

353
00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:20,700
You!

354
00:44:54,540 --> 00:44:55,760
Thank you.

355
00:46:18,390 --> 00:46:20,180
Nicely done.

356
00:46:25,830 --> 00:46:26,950
You try.

357
00:46:27,930 --> 00:46:29,360
Try.

358
00:49:38,620 --> 00:49:42,850
I just realized, I've been remiss.
Forgive me.

359
00:49:43,230 --> 00:49:46,660
I have yet to thank you
for looking out for me yesterday.

360
00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:49,190
That is your job, correct?.

361
00:49:49,670 --> 00:49:51,330
Protecting me?.

362
00:49:52,430 --> 00:49:54,330
Well done, Bob.

363
00:49:54,800 --> 00:49:57,170
You don't mind if I call you "" Bob,"" do you?.

364
00:49:57,770 --> 00:50:01,770
I knew a Bob once.
God, he was ugly as a mule.

365
00:50:02,740 --> 00:50:04,710
You a ladies' man, Bob?.

366
00:50:08,650 --> 00:50:12,480
Ujio is teaching you the way
of the Japanese sword.

367
00:50:14,190 --> 00:50:15,920
Yes, indeed.

368
00:50:17,790 --> 00:50:21,520
You fought against your Red lndians?.

369
00:50:26,230 --> 00:50:27,460
Yes.

370
00:50:27,640 --> 00:50:29,400
Tell me of your part in this war.

371
00:50:29,570 --> 00:50:31,130
-Why?.
-I wish to learn.

372
00:50:31,310 --> 00:50:34,640
-Read a book.
-I would rather have a good conversation.

373
00:50:34,810 --> 00:50:36,870
-Why?.
-Because...

374
00:50:37,050 --> 00:50:38,910
...we are both students of war.

375
00:50:46,420 --> 00:50:47,790
So...

376
00:50:49,060 --> 00:50:51,580
...you were the general of your army?.

377
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:55,460
No.

378
00:50:56,670 --> 00:50:59,100
I was a captain.

379
00:50:59,500 --> 00:51:01,530
This is a low rank?.

380
00:51:03,910 --> 00:51:05,740
A middle rank.

381
00:51:06,980 --> 00:51:08,310
And who was your general?.

382
00:51:13,450 --> 00:51:15,850
Don't you have a rebellion to lead?.

383
00:51:16,020 --> 00:51:19,350
People in your country
do not like conversation?.

384
00:51:19,520 --> 00:51:21,960
He was a lieutenant colonel.

385
00:51:22,620 --> 00:51:24,320
His name was Custer.

386
00:51:24,490 --> 00:51:25,790
I know this name.

387
00:51:26,330 --> 00:51:28,230
He killed many warriors.

388
00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:30,060
Oh, yes. Many warriors.

389
00:51:30,230 --> 00:51:32,390
So he was a good general.

390
00:51:32,570 --> 00:51:36,130
No. No, he wasn't a good general.
He was arrogant and foolhardy.

391
00:51:36,370 --> 00:51:40,670
He got massacred because he took a single
battalion against 2000 angry lndians.

392
00:51:41,180 --> 00:51:43,610
Two thousand lndians?.

393
00:51:44,010 --> 00:51:45,310
How many men for Custer?.

394
00:51:45,710 --> 00:51:47,150
Two hundred and eleven.

395
00:51:48,620 --> 00:51:50,550
I like this General Custer.

396
00:51:51,120 --> 00:51:55,150
He was a murderer who fell in love
with his own legend.

397
00:51:55,320 --> 00:51:57,450
And his troopers died for it.

398
00:51:57,630 --> 00:51:59,690
I think this is a very good death.

399
00:51:59,860 --> 00:52:01,850
Maybe you can have one
like it someday.

400
00:52:02,060 --> 00:52:04,190
If it is in my destiny.

401
00:52:05,130 --> 00:52:08,160
-What do you want from me?.
-What do you want for yourself?.

402
00:52:10,770 --> 00:52:12,210
What are you doing?.

403
00:52:12,370 --> 00:52:14,500
Why are we having these conversations?.

404
00:52:15,240 --> 00:52:17,610
What the hell am I doing here?.

405
00:52:22,780 --> 00:52:24,380
In spring...

406
00:52:24,550 --> 00:52:27,950
...the snows will melt
and the passes will open.

407
00:52:29,830 --> 00:52:32,450
Until that time, you are here.

408
00:52:34,300 --> 00:52:37,060
Good day, captain.

409
00:52:58,090 --> 00:52:59,920
1876.

410
00:53:00,090 --> 00:53:03,290
Day unknown. Month unknown.

411
00:53:04,360 --> 00:53:07,990
I continue to live among
these unusual people.

412
00:53:09,260 --> 00:53:12,460
I am their captive,
in that I cannot escape.

413
00:53:14,440 --> 00:53:17,130
Mostly, I'm treated with
a kind of a mild neglect...

414
00:53:18,070 --> 00:53:22,640
...as if I were a stray dog
or an unwelcome guest.

415
00:53:34,290 --> 00:53:37,450
Everyone is polite.
Everyone smiles and bows.

416
00:53:39,230 --> 00:53:43,820
But beneath their courtesy,
I detect a deep reservoir of feeling.

417
00:54:24,370 --> 00:54:26,140
They are an intriguing people.

418
00:54:26,470 --> 00:54:28,240
From the moment they wake...

419
00:54:28,410 --> 00:54:32,440
...they devote themselves to
the perfection of whatever they pursue.

420
00:54:40,990 --> 00:54:43,960
I have never seen such discipline.

421
00:54:45,030 --> 00:54:49,160
I am surprised to learn that the word
""Samurai"" means ""to serve ""...

422
00:54:49,330 --> 00:54:53,890
...and that Katsumoto believes his rebellion
to be in the service of the Emperor.

423
00:56:55,760 --> 00:56:58,390
Please forgive. T oo many mind.

424
00:56:59,830 --> 00:57:01,630
Too many mind?.

425
00:57:02,160 --> 00:57:06,460
Mind sword, mind people watch,
mind enemy.

426
00:57:07,300 --> 00:57:09,100
Too many mind.

427
00:57:11,110 --> 00:57:12,330
No mind.

428
00:57:14,340 --> 00:57:15,900
No mind.

429
00:57:57,620 --> 00:58:00,020
Not so fast. What are these?.

430
00:58:15,970 --> 00:58:17,370
No, no. Not so fast.

431
00:58:21,580 --> 00:58:22,800
I'm Algren.

432
00:58:30,590 --> 00:58:33,420
-Nobutada.
-Nobutada.

433
00:58:34,120 --> 00:58:36,060
-Magojiro.
-Magojiro.

434
00:58:36,220 --> 00:58:37,490
Higen.

435
00:58:38,130 --> 00:58:39,530
Higen.

436
00:58:43,100 --> 00:58:44,430
Taka.

437
00:59:53,570 --> 00:59:55,630
She's been very kind to me.

438
00:59:56,570 --> 01:00:00,560
She's honored to have
my guest in her house.

439
01:00:25,030 --> 01:00:27,730
Winter, 1877.

440
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:30,630
What does it mean to be Samurai?

441
01:00:30,810 --> 01:00:34,210
To devote yourself utterly
to a set of moral principles...

442
01:00:34,940 --> 01:00:37,840
... to seek a stillness of your mind...

443
01:00:38,480 --> 01:00:41,710
...and to master the way of the sword.

444
01:00:56,230 --> 01:00:57,600
Cold?.

445
01:01:09,410 --> 01:01:10,780
Also. Also cold.

446
01:01:11,850 --> 01:01:13,180
Fire.

447
01:01:21,760 --> 01:01:23,350
T o burn.

448
01:02:22,280 --> 01:02:23,510
I ' m sorry.

449
01:02:33,090 --> 01:02:36,000
For your husband, Hirotaro.

450
01:03:28,320 --> 01:03:31,110
Spring, 1 877.

451
01:03:31,550 --> 01:03:36,510
This marks the longest I have stayed
in one place since I left the farm at 1 7.

452
01:03:40,030 --> 01:03:43,360
There is so much here
that I'll never understand.

453
01:03:47,740 --> 01:03:50,530
I have never been a church-going man...

454
01:03:50,710 --> 01:03:55,110
...and what I've seen on the field of battle
has led me to question God's purpose.

455
01:03:55,280 --> 01:03:57,640
But there is, indeed, something...

456
01:03:57,810 --> 01:04:00,870
...spiritual in this place.

457
01:04:04,190 --> 01:04:07,620
And though it may forever
be obscure to me...

458
01:04:07,790 --> 01:04:11,250
...I cannot but be aware of its power.

459
01:04:19,730 --> 01:04:24,670
I do know it is here that I have known
my first untroubled sleep in many years.

460
01:04:28,040 --> 01:04:30,980
No, you gotta get the ball!
Go and get it.

461
01:04:31,150 --> 01:04:35,280
No, not me!
You gotta get the ball! The ball!

462
01:05:28,640 --> 01:05:30,300
No mind.

463
01:08:25,850 --> 01:08:27,250
Katsumoto!

464
01:11:54,290 --> 01:11:57,590
The perfect blossom is a rare thing.

465
01:11:57,760 --> 01:12:02,790
You could spend your life looking for one,
and it would not be a wasted life.

466
01:12:03,600 --> 01:12:05,590
Who sent those men to kill you?.

467
01:12:05,770 --> 01:12:08,860
I'm writing a poem about a dream I had.

468
01:12:09,370 --> 01:12:12,240
The tiger's eyes are like my own

469
01:12:12,410 --> 01:12:15,600
But he comes from across
A deep and troubled sea

470
01:12:16,540 --> 01:12:18,370
Was it the Emperor?.

471
01:12:20,210 --> 01:12:21,510
Omura?.

472
01:12:21,680 --> 01:12:25,580
If the Emperor wishes my death,
he has but to ask.

473
01:12:26,520 --> 01:12:28,350
So it was Omura.

474
01:12:28,920 --> 01:12:31,080
I'm having trouble finishing the poem.

475
01:12:31,260 --> 01:12:34,920
-Can you suggest a last line?.
-I'm not a writer.

476
01:12:35,200 --> 01:12:40,190
Yet you have written many pages
since you came here.

477
01:12:42,640 --> 01:12:44,800
What else has she told you?.

478
01:12:46,670 --> 01:12:48,730
You have nightmares.

479
01:12:51,580 --> 01:12:53,100
Every soldier has nightmares.

480
01:12:53,280 --> 01:12:56,740
Only one who is ashamed
of what he has done.

481
01:12:57,480 --> 01:13:00,720
You have no idea what I have done.

482
01:13:07,960 --> 01:13:11,120
You have seen many things.

483
01:13:12,200 --> 01:13:13,190
I have.

484
01:13:13,370 --> 01:13:17,600
And you do not fear death,
but sometimes you wish for it.

485
01:13:18,140 --> 01:13:20,160
Is this not so?.

486
01:13:22,740 --> 01:13:25,300
-Yes.
-l, also.

487
01:13:26,210 --> 01:13:30,270
It happens to men who have seen
what we have seen.

488
01:13:30,820 --> 01:13:36,280
And then I come to this place
of my ancestors...

489
01:13:36,590 --> 01:13:38,580
...and I remember.

490
01:13:38,760 --> 01:13:41,060
Like these blossoms...

491
01:13:41,800 --> 01:13:43,820
...we are all dying.

492
01:13:45,700 --> 01:13:49,160
To know life in every breath...

493
01:13:49,900 --> 01:13:52,130
...every cup of tea...

494
01:13:52,310 --> 01:13:55,330
...every life we take.

495
01:13:55,510 --> 01:13:57,880
The way of the warrior.

496
01:13:58,050 --> 01:14:00,240
Life in every breath.

497
01:14:01,350 --> 01:14:03,580
That is Bushido.

498
01:14:07,890 --> 01:14:11,520
The Emperor has granted
a safe passage to Tokyo.

499
01:14:12,190 --> 01:14:14,220
We leave tomorrow.

500
01:14:17,100 --> 01:14:18,530
Good.

501
01:14:19,630 --> 01:14:20,960
Good.

502
01:14:27,540 --> 01:14:30,510
When I took these, you were...

503
01:14:31,380 --> 01:14:32,970
...my enemy.

504
01:16:16,450 --> 01:16:20,110
Algren-san! Algren-san.

505
01:19:14,360 --> 01:19:16,020
Algren?.

506
01:19:16,200 --> 01:19:19,130
Algren, my God, you are alive.

507
01:19:23,200 --> 01:19:25,670
Well, you never cease to astonish.

508
01:19:26,370 --> 01:19:30,140
-Howitzers.
-Yes, indeed.

509
01:19:30,310 --> 01:19:33,070
As soon as the Emperor signs
the trade agreement...

510
01:19:33,250 --> 01:19:35,340
...he gets the whole package.

511
01:19:35,520 --> 01:19:39,040
Including this particular item.
Two hundred rounds a minute.

512
01:19:39,490 --> 01:19:42,680
And the new cartridges
cut down on jamming.

513
01:19:42,860 --> 01:19:44,590
I need a bath.

514
01:19:44,760 --> 01:19:48,350
After living with those savages,
I can only imagine.

515
01:19:49,900 --> 01:19:52,130
Welcome back, captain.

516
01:21:23,020 --> 01:21:25,580
Gentlemen, come in.

517
01:21:26,090 --> 01:21:30,750
Captain Algren, it seems you have
endured your captivity with little ill effect.

518
01:21:31,690 --> 01:21:33,250
I was not ill-treated, sir.

519
01:21:33,430 --> 01:21:37,020
Mr. Omura, I have here
a draft of the arms agreement.

520
01:21:37,200 --> 01:21:41,000
I'm eager to know how many Samurai
have joined Katsumoto.

521
01:21:41,170 --> 01:21:42,600
I'm afraid I don't know.

522
01:21:42,770 --> 01:21:46,140
-You spent the winter at his encampment.
-As his prisoner.

523
01:21:46,310 --> 01:21:50,540
Has he fortified his position?.
Acquired firearms?. Tell us what you saw.

524
01:21:50,710 --> 01:21:56,050
As you said, colonel,
they're savages with bows and arrows.

525
01:21:56,220 --> 01:22:00,180
-Sir, about the--
-I'm sure your documents are in order.

526
01:22:00,360 --> 01:22:04,790
Thank you. Leave them on my desk.
I'll address them at the appropriate time.

527
01:22:04,960 --> 01:22:09,330
With all due respect, sir,
our president's patience is wearing thin.

528
01:22:09,500 --> 01:22:12,020
Perhaps there is someone else
we should speak to.

529
01:22:12,200 --> 01:22:14,570
With all due respect, ambassador...

530
01:22:14,740 --> 01:22:17,470
...perhaps there is someone else
we should speak to.

531
01:22:17,640 --> 01:22:20,400
For instance, the French
or the English.

532
01:22:20,580 --> 01:22:23,700
Or any of the legations
waiting in the next room.

533
01:22:25,450 --> 01:22:28,710
We should be looking forward
to hearing from you.

534
01:22:29,490 --> 01:22:33,110
Good afternoon, gentlemen.
Captain Algren.

535
01:22:33,620 --> 01:22:38,390
Perhaps you and I might have
a word in private. Please, sit down.

536
01:22:41,460 --> 01:22:44,760
-May I offer you whiskey?.
-No, thank you.

537
01:22:51,070 --> 01:22:54,240
Katsumoto is an extraordinary man,
is he not?.

538
01:22:54,410 --> 01:22:58,110
He's a tribal leader.
I've known many of them.

539
01:22:58,280 --> 01:23:03,240
But none who are Samurai.
Their ways have great appeal.

540
01:23:03,420 --> 01:23:07,320
-I don't see how this concerns me.
-But it does.

541
01:23:07,490 --> 01:23:12,720
You see, you were right. Last year,
we were not prepared to go to battle.

542
01:23:12,900 --> 01:23:15,520
You were right,
and Colonel Bagley was wrong.

543
01:23:15,700 --> 01:23:17,630
But now, we are ready.

544
01:23:17,800 --> 01:23:21,240
If Katsumoto is allowed to attract
other Samurai to his cause...

545
01:23:21,400 --> 01:23:26,240
...we will have 1 0 years of rebellion.
This is something I will not allow.

546
01:23:26,410 --> 01:23:31,970
Either I'll stop him at the council today,
or you'll lead my army against him.

547
01:23:32,150 --> 01:23:36,280
And with these new weapons,
you will crush him.

548
01:23:38,090 --> 01:23:41,610
-I appreciate the offer.
-lt is not an offer.

549
01:23:42,390 --> 01:23:46,450
Mr. Omura, my contract with you
was to train your army.

550
01:23:46,630 --> 01:23:49,120
Then we will make a new contract...

551
01:23:49,300 --> 01:23:54,500
...one that will recognize the extraordinary
contribution you've made to the Emperor.

552
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:57,300
Do we understand each other?.

553
01:23:59,880 --> 01:24:03,810
-Yes, we understand each other perfectly.
-Then I am pleased.

554
01:24:21,960 --> 01:24:24,800
Captain Algren!
What in heaven's name is going on?.

555
01:24:24,970 --> 01:24:26,960
The diplomatic community is abuzz.

556
01:24:27,140 --> 01:24:29,870
Omura has passed laws
against the Samurai.

557
01:24:30,040 --> 01:24:31,230
I need a drink.

558
01:24:31,410 --> 01:24:36,470
Is your friend Katsumoto really planning
to go up against the council this afternoon?.

559
01:24:43,020 --> 01:24:44,180
My God, it's started.

560
01:24:55,130 --> 01:24:56,160
Captain Algren!
