1
00:01:57,050 --> 00:02:01,021
It's a great day for america,
everybody!

2
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,462
I'm always
delighted to be in nashville.

3
00:02:08,496 --> 00:02:10,164
I'm always happy
to be in the south.

4
00:02:10,198 --> 00:02:12,700
I feel this great affinity
with people in the south,

5
00:02:12,733 --> 00:02:16,003
Because i share your pain.

6
00:02:16,036 --> 00:02:18,071
I know what it's like

7
00:02:18,105 --> 00:02:19,373
To have everyone in the world

8
00:02:19,407 --> 00:02:23,143
Think they can do your accent
better than you can do.

9
00:02:25,078 --> 00:02:26,914
Right?

10
00:02:26,947 --> 00:02:30,718
And then they want to do
your accent to you

11
00:02:30,751 --> 00:02:33,587
To help you!

12
00:02:33,621 --> 00:02:37,157
"You from the south?
Hickity dickity dickity."

13
00:02:37,191 --> 00:02:38,659
Listen, i'm gonna try
something tonight.

14
00:02:38,692 --> 00:02:40,561
Because we're doing the special
and the cameras are here,

15
00:02:40,594 --> 00:02:41,595
And because i'm in the south

16
00:02:41,629 --> 00:02:43,197
And i feel a little more
comfortable here,

17
00:02:43,231 --> 00:02:45,566
I wanna try something
i don't normally do.

18
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:49,102
Um, i'm gonna try
and tell you a joke.

19
00:02:51,038 --> 00:02:53,774
I know what you're thinkin'.
"Oh, craig, come on.

20
00:02:53,807 --> 00:02:55,309
"Not a joke!

21
00:02:55,343 --> 00:02:56,677
"Not from you, craig!

22
00:02:56,710 --> 00:02:58,111
"There's professional
comedians

23
00:02:58,145 --> 00:03:00,047
"For that kind of thing.

24
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:02,283
"Not a joke from you, craig.

25
00:03:02,316 --> 00:03:06,019
"From you, we want tales
of the old country, craig.

26
00:03:06,053 --> 00:03:09,390
"Tell us about the time you
lived in the swamp with shrek.

27
00:03:09,423 --> 00:03:11,659
"Tell us about that!

28
00:03:11,692 --> 00:03:13,494
What was that like, craig?"

29
00:03:13,527 --> 00:03:18,165
Oh, we found
a blue-Haired donkey, all right!

30
00:03:20,133 --> 00:03:22,169
That's right!

31
00:03:22,202 --> 00:03:23,971
No, i wanna tell you
this joke.

32
00:03:24,004 --> 00:03:25,205
It's important for me,

33
00:03:25,239 --> 00:03:27,508
Because it's a dirty joke.

34
00:03:28,909 --> 00:03:30,344
Steady.

35
00:03:30,378 --> 00:03:31,445
No, it's a dirty joke,

36
00:03:31,479 --> 00:03:32,680
And i can't tell it
on my tv show,

37
00:03:32,713 --> 00:03:33,814
'Cause it's such
a dirty joke.

38
00:03:33,847 --> 00:03:35,483
And there's cuss words
in it too.

39
00:03:35,516 --> 00:03:37,485
Oh, yeah.

40
00:03:37,518 --> 00:03:39,453
I...listen, i will
be cussing tonight.

41
00:03:39,487 --> 00:03:41,322
And just so's you know...
no, i will.

42
00:03:41,355 --> 00:03:44,425
I will.
Don't fuckin' "ohh" me."

43
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:48,362
I'll be cussin'.

44
00:03:48,396 --> 00:03:50,298
Now, don't wave your finger
at me.

45
00:03:50,331 --> 00:03:54,167
You knew when you got here
there'd be cussin'.

46
00:03:54,201 --> 00:03:55,969
If you thought you were
comin' here tonight,

47
00:03:56,003 --> 00:03:58,071
And every time i cussed,
a little flag was goin' up here,

48
00:03:58,105 --> 00:04:00,941
And someone's going,
"tootsy fruitsy," or somethin'.

49
00:04:00,974 --> 00:04:02,943
"Ooh la la."

50
00:04:02,976 --> 00:04:05,446
I swear it's gonna be a long
fuckin' night for you

51
00:04:05,479 --> 00:04:07,281
If you thought
i was gonna do that.

52
00:04:09,283 --> 00:04:12,119
I can't cuss on tv,
and it bothers me.

53
00:04:12,152 --> 00:04:14,187
No, it does.
I...yeah!

54
00:04:14,221 --> 00:04:16,724
It does.
It does bother me.

55
00:04:16,757 --> 00:04:17,958
'Cause when i was
a young man,

56
00:04:17,991 --> 00:04:19,927
I was in punk rock groups
and everything.

57
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:21,128
And i was like,
"fuck you, man!

58
00:04:21,161 --> 00:04:23,297
"Fuck you! You'll never
get me wearing a suit

59
00:04:23,331 --> 00:04:25,499
And sittin' behind a desk!"

60
00:04:28,436 --> 00:04:30,804
And now, every night...

61
00:04:30,838 --> 00:04:32,473
Wearin' a suit,
sittin' behind a desk.

62
00:04:32,506 --> 00:04:35,042
Can't even say "fuck."

63
00:04:35,075 --> 00:04:37,911
"Ah, your movie sounds great,
ya fuckin' asshole."

64
00:04:42,015 --> 00:04:43,651
No, i don't wanna give you
the wrong impression, all right?

65
00:04:43,684 --> 00:04:46,620
I wasn't just in punk rock
bands, by the way.

66
00:04:46,654 --> 00:04:48,255
I was also
in a heavy metal band once.

67
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:49,890
One...one heavy metal band.

68
00:04:49,923 --> 00:04:51,392
- Whoo!
- Oh, yeah.

69
00:04:51,425 --> 00:04:52,860
Ah, you know,
if you'd have heard us,

70
00:04:52,893 --> 00:04:55,295
You wouldn't be
making that noise.

71
00:04:55,329 --> 00:04:56,797
You'd be like, "aah!"
And running out.

72
00:04:56,830 --> 00:04:58,499
We were ter...we were the worst
heavy meal band.

73
00:04:58,532 --> 00:05:00,100
We were terrible.
I was 15 years old

74
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:01,569
When i was in this band.

75
00:05:01,602 --> 00:05:04,572
We were called stag.

76
00:05:04,605 --> 00:05:07,608
We used to wear spandex pants
and no underwear.

77
00:05:08,709 --> 00:05:10,544
Yeah, we looked like
marble smugglers.

78
00:05:10,578 --> 00:05:12,780
Yeah!

79
00:05:12,813 --> 00:05:14,247
We were terrible!

80
00:05:14,281 --> 00:05:15,683
15-Year-Old heavy metal band.

81
00:05:15,716 --> 00:05:17,685
And you know your heavy metal
band's gonna suck

82
00:05:17,718 --> 00:05:21,121
When you've got
a clarinet player.

83
00:05:21,154 --> 00:05:23,023
* get your motor runnin'

84
00:05:26,093 --> 00:05:28,429
But we had to have
the clarinet player,

85
00:05:28,462 --> 00:05:29,597
'Cause his dad had a car,

86
00:05:29,630 --> 00:05:30,998
And he was willing
to drive us around,

87
00:05:31,031 --> 00:05:33,534
So we had to have
the fuckin' clarinet player.

88
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:35,669
But the clarinet player
was an artist,

89
00:05:35,703 --> 00:05:37,571
And he said,
"i'll do the bass drum skin.

90
00:05:37,605 --> 00:05:38,739
It'll be fuckin' awesome."

91
00:05:38,772 --> 00:05:39,940
We were like, "really?"
He went, "yeah.

92
00:05:39,973 --> 00:05:42,443
"It'll be a picture
of a stag.

93
00:05:42,476 --> 00:05:44,945
"But get this, a stag
with its antlers

94
00:05:44,978 --> 00:05:47,147
On fire."

95
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:48,449
We were like,

96
00:05:48,482 --> 00:05:50,918
"Fuck, yeah!"

97
00:05:50,951 --> 00:05:52,886
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

98
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:54,187
But no, see,

99
00:05:54,221 --> 00:05:55,355
It didn't work out
like that,

100
00:05:55,389 --> 00:05:56,990
'Cause he wasn't
that talented, this kid.

101
00:05:57,024 --> 00:05:59,560
So it didn't look like a stag
with his antlers on fire.

102
00:05:59,593 --> 00:06:02,730
It looked a badger
with red hair.

103
00:06:06,767 --> 00:06:09,537
I was the clarinet player.

104
00:06:11,505 --> 00:06:13,807
Yeah, that's right.

105
00:06:15,909 --> 00:06:18,045
But no more!

106
00:06:18,078 --> 00:06:21,949
Now i sit on tv
and i can't say "fuck."

107
00:06:21,982 --> 00:06:23,417
It bothers me, you know?

108
00:06:23,451 --> 00:06:25,686
It bothers me
that i can't cuss on tv.

109
00:06:25,719 --> 00:06:26,954
'Cause i'm a very cussy man.

110
00:06:26,987 --> 00:06:29,557
I am a very cussy man.
Not an angry cusser.

111
00:06:29,590 --> 00:06:31,759
I'm not one of them "fuck you"
cussers, like that.

112
00:06:31,792 --> 00:06:33,527
Like a, "fuck you!
Fuck! Fuck!" Like that.

113
00:06:33,561 --> 00:06:34,728
Like, "fuck!"

114
00:06:34,762 --> 00:06:38,265
I don't have to do that.
I just like doing that.

115
00:06:38,298 --> 00:06:40,300
But i'm not one of them, "fuck!
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!" Guys,

116
00:06:40,333 --> 00:06:41,835
Like that,
like a dog.

117
00:06:41,869 --> 00:06:45,172
That's what dogs are saying,
"fuck."

118
00:06:45,205 --> 00:06:47,107
They are saying it.
Not in, uh,

119
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:48,208
Adorable dog language.

120
00:06:48,241 --> 00:06:49,342
They're saying it in english.

121
00:06:49,376 --> 00:06:50,611
"Fuck! Fuck!

122
00:06:50,644 --> 00:06:53,113
"Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

123
00:06:53,146 --> 00:06:54,848
"Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

124
00:06:54,882 --> 00:06:57,384
"Fuck!

125
00:06:57,417 --> 00:06:58,786
Fuck!"

126
00:07:01,321 --> 00:07:03,491
Fuck. Fuck!

127
00:07:03,524 --> 00:07:05,459
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck,
fuck, fuck!

128
00:07:05,493 --> 00:07:08,261
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck,
fuck, fuck, fuck!

129
00:07:10,798 --> 00:07:12,099
Dogs are saying "fuck."

130
00:07:12,132 --> 00:07:14,301
Cats don't say "fuck,"
but they're thinking it.

131
00:07:16,236 --> 00:07:19,940
They're thinkin', "fuck you."

132
00:07:19,973 --> 00:07:21,675
No, i like to cuss.

133
00:07:21,709 --> 00:07:23,577
I'm not an angry cusser.
I'm not a "fuck you" guy.

134
00:07:23,611 --> 00:07:24,678
I'm not...i'm more
kind of like,

135
00:07:24,712 --> 00:07:25,846
"Shut the fuck up."

136
00:07:25,879 --> 00:07:26,914
Like that.

137
00:07:26,947 --> 00:07:28,015
Like friendly cussin', like,

138
00:07:28,048 --> 00:07:30,818
"No fuckin' way!"
Shit, fuck, no!"

139
00:07:30,851 --> 00:07:34,287
Like, that helps me be
more adorable to people.

140
00:07:34,321 --> 00:07:36,323
I know, i've heard all
the arguments against cussing.

141
00:07:36,356 --> 00:07:37,591
You know,
"oh, craig, come on.

142
00:07:37,625 --> 00:07:39,560
Cussing just shows a lack
of vocabulary."

143
00:07:39,593 --> 00:07:42,796
And i think,
"oh, shut the fuck up!"

144
00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:44,231
No, it does not.

145
00:07:44,264 --> 00:07:47,167
Some of the greatest
minds in history love to cuss.

146
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:49,302
Shakespeare cussed
all the time.

147
00:07:49,336 --> 00:07:51,639
But he did it in that fancy
ren fair language,

148
00:07:51,672 --> 00:07:52,973
So nobody knew
he was cussing.

149
00:07:53,006 --> 00:07:55,943
And like,
"to be or not to be?

150
00:07:55,976 --> 00:07:57,845
Fuck if i know."

151
00:08:01,448 --> 00:08:03,450
I'm paraphrasing,
but that's what he meant.

152
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:05,953
Uh...

153
00:08:05,986 --> 00:08:07,387
What i'm saying is,
i like to cuss.

154
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:08,989
It helps me be
friendly to people.

155
00:08:09,022 --> 00:08:10,423
It emphasizes
my friendliness.

156
00:08:10,457 --> 00:08:13,060
Like if you see...if you see
a friend of yours, right,

157
00:08:13,093 --> 00:08:14,261
And they've got new pants on,
and you go,

158
00:08:14,294 --> 00:08:15,729
"Oh, those are nice,
new pants."

159
00:08:15,763 --> 00:08:17,130
They'll go,
"oh, thanks very much."

160
00:08:17,164 --> 00:08:20,768
But if you go, "whoa!
Great fucking pants!"

161
00:08:20,801 --> 00:08:23,937
They're like, "i know!
Aren't they?

162
00:08:23,971 --> 00:08:26,640
"Man! I saw them
in the store!

163
00:08:26,674 --> 00:08:28,676
I was just like, 'fuck'!"

164
00:08:28,709 --> 00:08:30,811
I understand
you gotta be appropriate.

165
00:08:30,844 --> 00:08:32,145
You can't walk up to the pope
and say,

166
00:08:32,179 --> 00:08:33,246
"Great fuckin' pants,
your holiness."

167
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:37,217
You couldn't do that.

168
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:38,586
Well, that doesn't
work anyway,

169
00:08:38,619 --> 00:08:40,353
'Cause, well, the pope
doesn't wear pants.

170
00:08:40,387 --> 00:08:42,823
He wears that big dress.

171
00:08:42,856 --> 00:08:44,191
He wears these...
he's got a big ol' dress.

172
00:08:44,224 --> 00:08:45,959
And the...and the hat.

173
00:08:45,993 --> 00:08:47,194
Actually, two hats.

174
00:08:47,227 --> 00:08:49,196
He's got the big hat
and then the little hat

175
00:08:49,229 --> 00:08:51,865
For windy days.

176
00:08:53,867 --> 00:08:55,202
"Hey, what's
the weather like today?"

177
00:08:55,235 --> 00:08:56,336
"It's a little bit
windy, pope."

178
00:08:56,369 --> 00:09:00,307
"Okay, i'll wear
the little hat."

179
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:02,109
I'll get to this joke
in a minute,

180
00:09:02,142 --> 00:09:04,344
But you see, the...

181
00:09:04,377 --> 00:09:05,779
Do you know the pope...
this is true.

182
00:09:05,813 --> 00:09:07,080
I will get to the joke.

183
00:09:07,114 --> 00:09:09,516
But you know the pope actually
has special slippers

184
00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:12,119
Designed for him by the italian
fashion designer prada.

185
00:09:12,152 --> 00:09:14,287
This is true...they make 'em
just for the pope.

186
00:09:14,321 --> 00:09:15,656
It's not like you can
go and buy a line of them.

187
00:09:15,689 --> 00:09:16,790
You can't go
to the gap and go,

188
00:09:16,824 --> 00:09:17,825
"Give me some pope slippers."

189
00:09:17,858 --> 00:09:19,059
It's just for the pope.

190
00:09:19,092 --> 00:09:20,894
And they've got, you know,
special designs

191
00:09:20,928 --> 00:09:23,496
And a little crest
and writing on them and stuff

192
00:09:23,530 --> 00:09:28,335
That says p.O. On one
and p.E. On the other.

193
00:09:28,368 --> 00:09:33,674
"Ah, read-A my slippers here.
I'm-A the pope."

194
00:09:36,443 --> 00:09:38,846
"And-A my name is-A pepo."

195
00:09:42,683 --> 00:09:45,018
* i'm-A pepo,
i'm-A the pope *

196
00:09:45,052 --> 00:09:47,487
* i'm pepo, i'm-A the pope

197
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:49,723
All right, you're right,
you're right.

198
00:09:49,757 --> 00:09:50,824
You're right.
That's too much.

199
00:09:50,858 --> 00:09:52,425
Lay off.
You can go too far, craig.

200
00:09:52,459 --> 00:09:54,027
You're right.

201
00:09:54,061 --> 00:09:55,528
Anyway the pope...the pope
doesn't talk like that.

202
00:09:55,562 --> 00:09:57,530
He's not even italian
anymore, the pope.

203
00:09:57,564 --> 00:09:59,532
He's german.

204
00:09:59,566 --> 00:10:01,368
Yeah!

205
00:10:01,401 --> 00:10:03,036
So he doesn't...
he wouldn't talk like that.

206
00:10:03,070 --> 00:10:04,738
He would...he would be
more kind of,

207
00:10:04,772 --> 00:10:06,206
"As you are no doubt aware,

208
00:10:06,239 --> 00:10:07,741
I am the pope."

209
00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:13,546
"Observe my slippers."

210
00:10:18,752 --> 00:10:20,620
"My name is pepo."

211
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:26,393
"I realize this is an unusual
name for a german,

212
00:10:26,426 --> 00:10:27,761
"But...

213
00:10:27,795 --> 00:10:29,162
"My family was in the circus.

214
00:10:29,196 --> 00:10:31,699
So shut up, all right?"

215
00:10:31,732 --> 00:10:33,000
All right.
You're right.

216
00:10:33,033 --> 00:10:34,467
I won't do the pope.
That's ridiculous.

217
00:10:34,501 --> 00:10:36,770
What i'm saying is,
i'm not allowed to cuss.

218
00:10:36,804 --> 00:10:38,538
I can't cuss, you know,
on tv,

219
00:10:38,571 --> 00:10:39,973
And i'm not allowed to cuss
at home, either.

220
00:10:40,007 --> 00:10:41,174
I can't cuss at home.

221
00:10:41,208 --> 00:10:42,676
'Cause i've got
a 91/2-Year-Old son.

222
00:10:42,710 --> 00:10:45,578
And for some reason
not connected to his dna,

223
00:10:45,612 --> 00:10:49,616
He seems to be an attack dog
for the fuckin' fcc!

224
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:52,019
He does! He follows me around
with that little jar of his.

225
00:10:52,052 --> 00:10:53,921
"You said the f-Word, daddy.
Nickel in the jar."

226
00:10:53,954 --> 00:10:55,255
I'm like, "fuck you!"
He's like, "nickel in the jar."

227
00:10:55,288 --> 00:10:57,190
"Fuck you!"
"Nickel in the jar."

228
00:10:57,224 --> 00:10:58,726
Like, "who in the fuck
are you?"

229
00:10:58,759 --> 00:11:01,729
"Nickel in the jar, daddy!"

230
00:11:01,762 --> 00:11:02,930
I just pay him in advance now.

231
00:11:02,963 --> 00:11:04,164
I'm like,
"son, there's 20 bucks.

232
00:11:04,197 --> 00:11:05,933
I gotta call your mother."

233
00:11:15,442 --> 00:11:16,810
Do you know what my son
said to me?

234
00:11:16,844 --> 00:11:19,212
He said, you know, he asked me
what the f-Word means.

235
00:11:19,246 --> 00:11:20,647
I said,
"it's a naughty word, son."

236
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:24,651
He's like, "no shit, dad,
i'm gettin' rich."

237
00:11:24,684 --> 00:11:28,521
There's a nickel.
I can afford it.

238
00:11:28,555 --> 00:11:30,523
No, he said to me,
"what does the f-Word mean?"

239
00:11:30,557 --> 00:11:32,459
I said, "it's a very
naughty word, son.

240
00:11:32,492 --> 00:11:33,660
"It's very, very naughty.

241
00:11:33,693 --> 00:11:36,029
It's a...it's a naughty word
for sex."

242
00:11:36,063 --> 00:11:38,631
He's like,
"you know about sex, dad?"

243
00:11:38,665 --> 00:11:40,433
I was like, "yeah,
i remember it vaguely.

244
00:11:40,467 --> 00:11:41,902
Why do you ask?"

245
00:11:41,935 --> 00:11:43,436
I said, "do you
know about sex?"

246
00:11:43,470 --> 00:11:45,072
He said, "yeah."
I said, "ooh, wait there.

247
00:11:45,105 --> 00:11:46,940
"This will be adorable.
I'll get the video camera.

248
00:11:46,974 --> 00:11:48,641
I'll ask him about sex.
This'll be great."

249
00:11:48,675 --> 00:11:51,111
'Cause he's 91/2.
What's he gonna say about sex?

250
00:11:51,144 --> 00:11:53,847
"Santa, angels, moonbeams."

251
00:11:53,881 --> 00:11:56,183
It'll be adorable.
He'll be like that bill cosby,

252
00:11:56,216 --> 00:11:57,851
Kids are funny little
motherfuckers.

253
00:11:57,885 --> 00:12:00,553
That thing.

254
00:12:00,587 --> 00:12:02,856
They...

255
00:12:02,890 --> 00:12:05,893
I'm paraphrasing,
but that's what he means.

256
00:12:07,895 --> 00:12:09,329
Anyway, so, you know,
i thought,

257
00:12:09,362 --> 00:12:11,598
"I'll film him, you know.
"He'll tell me about sex.

258
00:12:11,631 --> 00:12:13,366
"Then i'll wait till
he's about 14,

259
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:14,902
"And then i'll say,
'hey, remember that money

260
00:12:14,935 --> 00:12:16,303
"'In the swear jar?

261
00:12:16,336 --> 00:12:17,871
"'I'll take it back now,
or this shit goes on youtube,

262
00:12:17,905 --> 00:12:20,740
You little bastard.'"

263
00:12:20,774 --> 00:12:24,044
You're welcome, parents.

264
00:12:24,077 --> 00:12:25,913
So i set him up, and i said,
"do you know about sex, son?"

265
00:12:25,946 --> 00:12:27,815
He said, "i know
all about sex, dad."

266
00:12:27,848 --> 00:12:29,282
I went, "all right,
what do you know about sex?"

267
00:12:29,316 --> 00:12:30,483
He said,
"i know all about sex.

268
00:12:30,517 --> 00:12:32,485
"Penis, vagina, glory hole,
dirty sanchez,

269
00:12:32,519 --> 00:12:33,987
Rusty trombone,
cleveland steamer."

270
00:12:34,021 --> 00:12:35,688
I'm like, "what the fuck?
What the fuck?

271
00:12:35,722 --> 00:12:37,590
What the fuck?"

272
00:12:39,827 --> 00:12:42,762
"What the fuck?

273
00:12:42,796 --> 00:12:43,931
"Cleveland steamer.
What is that?

274
00:12:43,964 --> 00:12:46,499
Well, never mind!
Never mind!"

275
00:12:47,534 --> 00:12:49,202
I never taught
my son about sex.

276
00:12:49,236 --> 00:12:50,237
I never, i didn't!

277
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:52,605
I will never teach
my son about sex!

278
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:55,342
Just like my father
never taught me!

279
00:12:55,375 --> 00:12:58,045
And his father
never taught him, and...

280
00:12:58,078 --> 00:12:59,512
Actually, it's a fuckin' miracle
scottish people

281
00:12:59,546 --> 00:13:03,583
Didn't die out
in the middle ages.

282
00:13:03,616 --> 00:13:04,952
Scottish people don't talk
about sex!

283
00:13:04,985 --> 00:13:06,619
We can't; it's too
embarrassing for us.

284
00:13:06,653 --> 00:13:07,988
We can't talk about it.
If a...

285
00:13:08,021 --> 00:13:09,890
If a scottish person wants
to talk about sex,

286
00:13:09,923 --> 00:13:11,458
We just kind of giggle
and walk backwards

287
00:13:11,491 --> 00:13:14,027
And point at our genitals.

288
00:13:23,236 --> 00:13:24,771
It's true.

289
00:13:24,804 --> 00:13:26,273
If you go to scotland
and you see someone

290
00:13:26,306 --> 00:13:27,975
That looks like
they might be special

291
00:13:28,008 --> 00:13:29,843
And they have to go
to the bathroom,

292
00:13:29,877 --> 00:13:33,280
They don't...
they just find you attractive.

293
00:13:38,751 --> 00:13:42,455
Nobody talks about sex
in scotland.

294
00:13:42,489 --> 00:13:44,024
Scottish gynecologists

295
00:13:44,057 --> 00:13:45,658
Don't even talk about sex.

296
00:13:45,692 --> 00:13:47,127
It's just like,

297
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:49,062
"Uh, get up on the table
there, mrs. Henderson.

298
00:13:49,096 --> 00:13:50,097
Lift up your skirt."

299
00:13:55,335 --> 00:13:58,605
"We'll take a look
at your magic baby door."

300
00:14:02,242 --> 00:14:03,944
Ah, nobody talks...
so i said to my son,

301
00:14:03,977 --> 00:14:05,745
I said, "who...
who taught you about sex, son?

302
00:14:05,778 --> 00:14:06,947
"This is awful.

303
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:09,282
W-Was it the creepy guy
in the school parking lot?"

304
00:14:09,316 --> 00:14:11,184
I said...'cause my son
goes to the same school

305
00:14:11,218 --> 00:14:12,319
As charlie sheen's kids.

306
00:14:12,352 --> 00:14:13,786
So i thought it might
be that, you know.

307
00:14:15,188 --> 00:14:18,058
Whoa! Hey, whoa!

308
00:14:18,091 --> 00:14:20,627
Whoa!

309
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:23,363
Hey, what...
you "ooh" me for charlie sheen,

310
00:14:23,396 --> 00:14:26,633
And you're okay
with the pope thing?

311
00:14:26,666 --> 00:14:30,003
What the hell
happened to you?

312
00:14:30,037 --> 00:14:31,438
"Aw, craig, come on.

313
00:14:31,471 --> 00:14:33,240
"Charlie sheen!

314
00:14:33,273 --> 00:14:34,641
"What did he ever do,

315
00:14:34,674 --> 00:14:36,709
"Apart from hold a knife
to his wife's throat

316
00:14:36,743 --> 00:14:38,345
On christmas eve?"

317
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:46,319
"Put the hooker
in the closet!"

318
00:14:52,993 --> 00:14:54,427
Aw, poor charlie.
You're right.

319
00:14:54,461 --> 00:14:55,662
I shouldn't go
after charlie.

320
00:14:55,695 --> 00:14:58,598
He had to go to jail
on christmas eve.

321
00:14:58,631 --> 00:15:02,269
Yeah, in fuckin' aspen!

322
00:15:02,302 --> 00:15:04,671
The jail in aspen
has been on the cover

323
00:15:04,704 --> 00:15:07,907
Of architectural digest!

324
00:15:10,377 --> 00:15:12,279
So i said to my son,
"who taught you about sex, son?"

325
00:15:12,312 --> 00:15:13,280
He said, "the teachers."

326
00:15:13,313 --> 00:15:14,414
I said, "the teachers
at school?"

327
00:15:14,447 --> 00:15:15,848
He went, "yeah."

328
00:15:15,882 --> 00:15:17,517
I went, "fourth grade?"
He's like, "yeah."

329
00:15:17,550 --> 00:15:19,586
I'm like,
"what the fuck?"

330
00:15:19,619 --> 00:15:23,256
"See, that's a nickel."
I went, "fuck you!"

331
00:15:23,290 --> 00:15:24,757
But i...i don't...
there was no se...

332
00:15:24,791 --> 00:15:27,127
I never got taught about sex
when i was in the fourth grade.

333
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:29,162
I never actually had
the fourth grade.

334
00:15:29,196 --> 00:15:30,563
I was in scotland.

335
00:15:30,597 --> 00:15:32,799
I was working up a chimney.

336
00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:36,769
Because there was
no sex education in scotland.

337
00:15:36,803 --> 00:15:38,538
And...well,
that's not true, actually.

338
00:15:38,571 --> 00:15:41,308
When i was about 15 years old,
in science class one day,

339
00:15:41,341 --> 00:15:42,675
I remember the...

340
00:15:42,709 --> 00:15:45,378
I was sitting around with
the rest of the guys in stag...

341
00:15:45,412 --> 00:15:49,016
Um...

342
00:15:49,049 --> 00:15:50,517
And we were waiting for
the science teacher

343
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:51,484
To come in one morning.

344
00:15:51,518 --> 00:15:53,086
His name was mr. Weir.

345
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:56,056
Nasty, bitter old
vicious alcoholic.

346
00:15:57,757 --> 00:15:59,026
Don't know what the fuck
was going on

347
00:15:59,059 --> 00:16:01,661
With the scottish education
board in the 1970s.

348
00:16:01,694 --> 00:16:02,929
It was like,
"do you like whiskey?

349
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:05,398
Do you hate kids?
The job's yours."

350
00:16:07,567 --> 00:16:08,901
Anyway, we...

351
00:16:08,935 --> 00:16:10,303
We were sitting
in science class,

352
00:16:10,337 --> 00:16:12,472
And we were waiting for
mr. Weir to come in,

353
00:16:12,505 --> 00:16:14,007
And, you know,
and then he came in,

354
00:16:14,041 --> 00:16:15,342
And we knew there was something
wrong when he came in,

355
00:16:15,375 --> 00:16:17,777
'Cause he was like...

356
00:16:21,348 --> 00:16:23,916
And he was...
this is true.

357
00:16:23,950 --> 00:16:25,818
He was carrying
a little aquarium with him.

358
00:16:25,852 --> 00:16:26,953
A little fish tank.

359
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:28,355
But there were
no fish in it.

360
00:16:28,388 --> 00:16:29,956
It was just...no water.
It was just a rock

361
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:31,624
With two toads on it.

362
00:16:31,658 --> 00:16:32,759
And he said,

363
00:16:32,792 --> 00:16:34,727
"Pay attention, everyone."

364
00:16:36,763 --> 00:16:39,199
"This is mr. And mrs. Toad.

365
00:16:39,232 --> 00:16:41,768
"They're married.

366
00:16:41,801 --> 00:16:46,005
"They were married
in a church.

367
00:16:46,039 --> 00:16:49,442
"By a protestant minister.

368
00:16:49,476 --> 00:16:52,379
"And now, they...
eeh eeh.

369
00:16:52,412 --> 00:16:55,448
"Now they want
to have a baby.

370
00:16:55,482 --> 00:16:59,686
See how mr. Toad
is pushing his shame branch..."

371
00:17:06,293 --> 00:17:08,528
"See how he's pushing
his shame branch

372
00:17:08,561 --> 00:17:10,930
"Against mrs. Toad's
magic baby door?

373
00:17:10,963 --> 00:17:13,933
Do you see that?"

374
00:17:13,966 --> 00:17:16,436
That was my sex education
in school, and that was it.

375
00:17:16,469 --> 00:17:18,338
Watchin' two toads
fuckin' in a fish tank!

376
00:17:18,371 --> 00:17:20,173
That's it!

377
00:17:20,207 --> 00:17:21,874
The miracle of new life.

378
00:17:21,908 --> 00:17:23,643
"Ehh."

379
00:17:23,676 --> 00:17:24,877
That was all i ever knew!

380
00:17:24,911 --> 00:17:26,313
For years,
i thought the only way

381
00:17:26,346 --> 00:17:27,580
To get a girl
to go out with you

382
00:17:27,614 --> 00:17:29,382
Was run up behind her,
grab her hair,

383
00:17:29,416 --> 00:17:31,218
Spit in it,
and shout, "ribbit!"

384
00:17:36,022 --> 00:17:38,024
It's stran...if i saw
a woman i was attracted to

385
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:39,592
Across a crowded room,
i'd be like...

386
00:17:39,626 --> 00:17:41,194
Pff!

387
00:17:44,764 --> 00:17:48,668
You know the weirdest thing,
it fuckin' works!

388
00:17:48,701 --> 00:17:51,070
It does!
You gotta go, pff!

389
00:17:51,104 --> 00:17:53,673
They're like, "get lost,
you freak."

390
00:17:53,706 --> 00:17:55,208
"Pff! Pff!"

391
00:18:05,852 --> 00:18:08,621
"I like him."

392
00:18:10,056 --> 00:18:11,991
That was it; that was my sex
education, the two toads.

393
00:18:12,024 --> 00:18:14,527
So consequently, i'm very
old-Fashioned about sex.

394
00:18:14,561 --> 00:18:16,196
I'm not like
the youngsters today

395
00:18:16,229 --> 00:18:18,097
With their new ideas
about sex.

396
00:18:18,131 --> 00:18:19,666
You know, photographing
your genitals

397
00:18:19,699 --> 00:18:22,435
And texting them to each other
and all that shit.

398
00:18:22,469 --> 00:18:25,505
What the hell is wrong
with you people?

399
00:18:25,538 --> 00:18:28,908
"Ah, this'll be sexy.
Ca-Ching!"

400
00:18:30,743 --> 00:18:32,279
No, i'm very old-Fashioned
about sex.

401
00:18:32,312 --> 00:18:34,547
I'm a romantic...i don't need
all that emailing

402
00:18:34,581 --> 00:18:36,283
And phones
and cameras and shit.

403
00:18:36,316 --> 00:18:37,850
I'm a romantic.
I'm an old-Fashioned about sex.

404
00:18:37,884 --> 00:18:39,652
I couple of hookers,
some blow, a midget.

405
00:18:39,686 --> 00:18:41,921
I'm good, i don't...

406
00:18:41,954 --> 00:18:44,857
That's how we used to do it!

407
00:18:44,891 --> 00:18:47,093
That's how
we used to do it.

408
00:18:48,161 --> 00:18:50,263
That's the old-Fashioned way.

409
00:18:50,297 --> 00:18:52,532
When things were simpler.

410
00:18:52,565 --> 00:18:55,101
I don't...i would never send
any of them sexy emails.

411
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:58,070
That's how you get caught.

412
00:18:58,104 --> 00:19:00,072
I've never sent one.

413
00:19:00,106 --> 00:19:02,675
I don't mind getting them
at craig@theinternet/google.Com.

414
00:19:02,709 --> 00:19:06,746
But i...

415
00:19:06,779 --> 00:19:08,147
Seriously.

416
00:19:11,251 --> 00:19:12,785
I'd never send a sexy email.

417
00:19:12,819 --> 00:19:14,086
That's how tiger woods
got caught.

418
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:15,788
He was sending all them
sexy emails from his phone,

419
00:19:15,822 --> 00:19:17,557
And then his wife was
in the kitchen one day,

420
00:19:17,590 --> 00:19:19,025
And she's like, "oh, i can't
find the kitchen phone.

421
00:19:19,058 --> 00:19:20,593
"I'll just use tiger's phone.
Might as well...

422
00:19:20,627 --> 00:19:23,162
" Aaah!

423
00:19:23,196 --> 00:19:24,831
"Tiger! I'm gonna need
the nine-Iron for this.

424
00:19:24,864 --> 00:19:26,533
Come here, you bastard!"

425
00:19:29,068 --> 00:19:30,803
See, even tiger woods got caught
in that big sex scandal.

426
00:19:30,837 --> 00:19:32,739
I was like you ladies.
I was outraged.

427
00:19:32,772 --> 00:19:34,441
Outraged.

428
00:19:36,576 --> 00:19:38,110
It's kind of good
if you're a guy, though.

429
00:19:38,144 --> 00:19:39,912
'Cause it just
makes you look great.

430
00:19:39,946 --> 00:19:42,349
"Ah, i'm sorry i forgot
to take out the garbage, honey.

431
00:19:42,382 --> 00:19:43,683
"I was too busy
not having sex

432
00:19:43,716 --> 00:19:45,252
"With 14 mistresses.

433
00:19:45,285 --> 00:19:48,388
Uh...sorry."

434
00:19:51,858 --> 00:19:53,626
See, when tiger woods
got caught in the sex scandal,

435
00:19:53,660 --> 00:19:55,562
And everybody said,
"oh, tiger woods.

436
00:19:55,595 --> 00:19:57,163
"His career is ruined.

437
00:19:57,196 --> 00:19:59,299
"He's ruined!
He'll never play golf again!

438
00:19:59,332 --> 00:20:00,800
"He will never play golf again!

439
00:20:00,833 --> 00:20:01,801
He'll be hopeless now."

440
00:20:01,834 --> 00:20:03,336
And i'm thinking,
"are you sure?

441
00:20:03,370 --> 00:20:04,971
Are you sure?
Are you thinking this through?"

442
00:20:05,004 --> 00:20:06,639
I think, once this
blows over a bit,

443
00:20:06,673 --> 00:20:09,342
He's gonna be better at golf.
Better!

444
00:20:09,376 --> 00:20:13,413
Because, clearly,
he never practiced before.

445
00:20:13,446 --> 00:20:16,416
He wasn't practicin'!
He's just fuckin' and winnin'!

446
00:20:16,449 --> 00:20:21,954
Fuckin' and winnin'!
Fuckin' and winnin'!

447
00:20:26,058 --> 00:20:28,060
"Hey, tiger, tiger.

448
00:20:28,094 --> 00:20:29,462
You want to go
to the driving range?"

449
00:20:29,496 --> 00:20:30,463
"Sorry, no time.

450
00:20:30,497 --> 00:20:33,300
Just fucking and winning!"

451
00:20:33,333 --> 00:20:35,335
And then when he did
come back to golf,

452
00:20:35,368 --> 00:20:36,469
And everybody's...like,

453
00:20:36,503 --> 00:20:38,405
The whole country
watched his return to golf.

454
00:20:38,438 --> 00:20:39,972
Tiger's return
after the scandal.

455
00:20:40,006 --> 00:20:41,408
Everybody's watching.

456
00:20:41,441 --> 00:20:45,144
And i'm thinking, "what the hell
do you expect to see here?"

457
00:20:45,177 --> 00:20:47,013
It's professional golf.
He's just gonna golf.

458
00:20:47,046 --> 00:20:48,315
What do you think?

459
00:20:48,348 --> 00:20:52,719
He's gonna go nuts
and fuck the hole or something?

460
00:20:52,752 --> 00:20:54,387
Like, "i've got
to make this putt.

461
00:20:54,421 --> 00:20:59,025
I've got to get back in the...
ah, fuck it. Aah!"

462
00:20:59,058 --> 00:21:01,027
The whole country.
We're all watching it.

463
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:05,365
Everyone watching his pants
as he walked up the fairway.

464
00:21:05,398 --> 00:21:08,835
It moved. It moved.
Did you see it? It moved.

465
00:21:13,540 --> 00:21:15,608
Seeing a big celebrity
gets caught in a sex scandal

466
00:21:15,642 --> 00:21:17,610
Like that though, and i hear
about it in the morning,

467
00:21:17,644 --> 00:21:20,413
I'm like, "oh, fuck yeah.
Easy day at work."

468
00:21:22,281 --> 00:21:23,583
It's awesome.

469
00:21:23,616 --> 00:21:25,585
Oh, yes.

470
00:21:25,618 --> 00:21:27,253
It was, like,
the best one ever

471
00:21:27,286 --> 00:21:29,121
Was when dick cheney
shot his lawyer in the face.

472
00:21:29,155 --> 00:21:30,823
I was like, "oh, fuck yeah.

473
00:21:30,857 --> 00:21:34,293
Oh, fantastic.
He shot his lawyer in the face?"

474
00:21:34,327 --> 00:21:37,063
"Yeah."
"Oh, beautiful."

475
00:21:37,096 --> 00:21:40,633
"Did the lawyer die?"
"No, the lawyer lived!"

476
00:21:40,667 --> 00:21:45,171
'Cause if the lawyer dies,
you have to wait a day.

477
00:21:45,204 --> 00:21:49,576
Hey, hey, for a human,
it's three days.

478
00:21:56,248 --> 00:21:59,251
Wait, wait. Wait.

479
00:21:59,285 --> 00:22:00,687
Let's just stop for a second

480
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:04,957
And discuss what kind of fuckin'
reaction that was there.

481
00:22:04,991 --> 00:22:06,959
"Oh, craig,
that's a terrible thing.

482
00:22:06,993 --> 00:22:08,495
"Actually,
now that we think about it,

483
00:22:08,528 --> 00:22:11,898
Now we agree with you.
Yeah."

484
00:22:11,931 --> 00:22:15,368
Even lawyers are like,
"he's right. We're assholes."

485
00:22:20,139 --> 00:22:21,841
I met dick cheney
when i was at the white house.

486
00:22:21,874 --> 00:22:24,043
I was speaking at the white
house correspondence dinner,

487
00:22:24,076 --> 00:22:26,546
And i met dick cheney there.
I was terrified.

488
00:22:26,579 --> 00:22:28,415
He's like
a fuckin' bond villain.

489
00:22:28,448 --> 00:22:30,116
He is!
He's like...

490
00:22:36,889 --> 00:22:37,924
He does this with his hand.

491
00:22:37,957 --> 00:22:40,427
There's nothing there.
He just does it.

492
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:45,398
He's stroking
an imaginary pussy.

493
00:22:45,432 --> 00:22:48,134
If that's a crime,
lock me up.

494
00:22:48,167 --> 00:22:50,102
But...

495
00:22:50,136 --> 00:22:52,004
I was actually terrified
when i met him,

496
00:22:52,038 --> 00:22:54,106
'Cause i said some mean things
about him in the speech,

497
00:22:54,140 --> 00:22:56,042
And then after i was like,
"oh, is that okay?"

498
00:22:56,075 --> 00:22:59,111
He went, "oh, no, i loved it.

499
00:22:59,145 --> 00:23:01,113
"I can take it.
I enjoyed myself.

500
00:23:01,147 --> 00:23:03,049
"I...i enjoyed it very much.

501
00:23:03,082 --> 00:23:06,385
Now you,
you enjoy your audit."

502
00:23:08,354 --> 00:23:09,355
And you know what?

503
00:23:09,388 --> 00:23:12,592
I got fuckin' audited.

504
00:23:12,625 --> 00:23:15,928
I know.

505
00:23:15,962 --> 00:23:17,697
Yeah, anyway,
that's my job now, apparently,

506
00:23:17,730 --> 00:23:20,567
Pick on celebrities that get
caught with their pants down.

507
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:22,301
I never used
to give a shit about it,

508
00:23:22,334 --> 00:23:24,471
But now i have to pay
attention to it, apparently.

509
00:23:24,504 --> 00:23:25,505
The first time it happened...

510
00:23:25,538 --> 00:23:27,206
When i got
the late night show,

511
00:23:27,239 --> 00:23:29,208
The first one
i ever had to deal with

512
00:23:29,241 --> 00:23:30,943
Was the kevin costner
sex scandal.

513
00:23:30,977 --> 00:23:32,078
Remember that?

514
00:23:32,111 --> 00:23:35,381
Yeah, nobody fuckin'
remembers that.

515
00:23:35,414 --> 00:23:36,483
Which tells me two things...

516
00:23:36,516 --> 00:23:38,818
One, kevin costner
has a great publicist,

517
00:23:38,851 --> 00:23:40,219
And two, none of you fuckers

518
00:23:40,252 --> 00:23:43,556
Was watching my show
in the first year.

519
00:23:43,590 --> 00:23:45,792
It's all right.

520
00:23:45,825 --> 00:23:47,426
"That's right.

521
00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:51,163
I don't even fuckin'
watch it now."

522
00:23:57,036 --> 00:23:58,070
Well, very briefly,

523
00:23:58,104 --> 00:23:59,906
The first...the kevin costner
sex scandal,

524
00:23:59,939 --> 00:24:02,041
Actually,
it was golf related, again.

525
00:24:02,074 --> 00:24:04,043
He was in scotland,
of all places.

526
00:24:04,076 --> 00:24:07,514
Kevin costner went to scotland
to play golf at st. Andrews,

527
00:24:07,547 --> 00:24:08,948
The royal and ancient
home of golf.

528
00:24:08,981 --> 00:24:10,783
And apparently,
after his golf game,

529
00:24:10,817 --> 00:24:12,819
Or allegedly,
for legal reasons,

530
00:24:12,852 --> 00:24:14,153
He was getting a massage,

531
00:24:14,186 --> 00:24:18,124
And he asked the masseuse
for a happy ending.

532
00:24:18,157 --> 00:24:20,860
What we would now call
an al gore.

533
00:24:25,865 --> 00:24:28,568
All right, all right.

534
00:24:28,601 --> 00:24:32,171
Okay.

535
00:24:32,204 --> 00:24:33,740
Anyway, by the way,
when he did this,

536
00:24:33,773 --> 00:24:36,676
You know, uh, he wasn't just
on any vacation in scotland.

537
00:24:36,709 --> 00:24:38,410
He was on his honeymoon.

538
00:24:38,444 --> 00:24:40,747
Oh, mm, yes.

539
00:24:40,780 --> 00:24:45,051
Feel a little more comfortable
judging him now, don't you?

540
00:24:45,084 --> 00:24:46,819
"Oh, thanks, craig, yes.

541
00:24:46,853 --> 00:24:50,022
Now we can enjoy it
just a little more."

542
00:24:50,056 --> 00:24:51,758
No, apparently...
i don't know if it's true,

543
00:24:51,791 --> 00:24:52,992
But apparently
that's what he did.

544
00:24:53,025 --> 00:24:54,426
He asked the masseuse
for a happy ending.

545
00:24:54,460 --> 00:24:55,995
And i'm thinking,
"kevin, who the hell

546
00:24:56,028 --> 00:24:59,331
"Goes to the royal and ancient
home of golf and thinks,

547
00:24:59,365 --> 00:25:03,102
'I wonder if i can get my three-
Wood polished while i'm here'?"

548
00:25:03,135 --> 00:25:06,639
And i'm thinking
the masseuse is scottish.

549
00:25:06,673 --> 00:25:09,241
Are you out of your mind?

550
00:25:09,275 --> 00:25:11,944
If i could get a scottish woman
to give me a hand job,

551
00:25:11,978 --> 00:25:16,115
I would never
have fuckin' emigrated.

552
00:25:16,148 --> 00:25:17,584
What the hell?

553
00:25:30,863 --> 00:25:35,201
You're a bad girl,
aren't ya?

554
00:25:35,234 --> 00:25:36,468
Anyway,
so apparently he did this.

555
00:25:36,502 --> 00:25:37,670
I don't know
if he did it or not.

556
00:25:37,704 --> 00:25:38,671
But i heard about it,

557
00:25:38,705 --> 00:25:39,872
And, you know, i thought,

558
00:25:39,906 --> 00:25:42,108
"Well, it's my job now
to make fun of this.

559
00:25:42,141 --> 00:25:43,576
This is my job, i guess."

560
00:25:43,610 --> 00:25:46,045
And so that night
i talked about it on the show.

561
00:25:46,078 --> 00:25:47,413
I, uh, i didn't do much.

562
00:25:47,446 --> 00:25:49,548
I punned on his movie titles
a little bit.

563
00:25:49,582 --> 00:25:51,784
I think i said
lap dances with wolves,

564
00:25:51,818 --> 00:25:53,986
And...

565
00:25:54,020 --> 00:25:56,656
Field of creams,
i think i did.

566
00:26:00,426 --> 00:26:03,229
People will come, ray.
No, i...

567
00:26:03,262 --> 00:26:05,031
I didn't do that.

568
00:26:05,064 --> 00:26:06,265
I didn't do that!

569
00:26:06,298 --> 00:26:08,234
I didn't. I didn't.

570
00:26:08,267 --> 00:26:09,836
I fuckin'
should have done that,

571
00:26:09,869 --> 00:26:11,503
But i didn't do that.

572
00:26:11,537 --> 00:26:13,539
Anyway, that's what i did
that night on the show.

573
00:26:13,572 --> 00:26:15,642
And then the next night
you move on to the next thing.

574
00:26:15,675 --> 00:26:16,809
I'd forgotten all about it.

575
00:26:16,843 --> 00:26:18,510
You move on. You get the robot
or the puppets,

576
00:26:18,544 --> 00:26:20,813
Or whatever the hell
you're doing, and...

577
00:26:20,847 --> 00:26:22,882
Before...you know,
a couple of weeks after that,

578
00:26:22,915 --> 00:26:25,384
I get invited
to a big hollywood party.

579
00:26:25,417 --> 00:26:27,486
Now, i don't normally go
to big hollywood parties,

580
00:26:27,519 --> 00:26:30,757
'Cause i'm not normally invited
to big hollywood parties,

581
00:26:30,790 --> 00:26:32,391
But i got invited,
so i went.

582
00:26:32,424 --> 00:26:34,827
And i got introduced
to kevin costner.

583
00:26:34,861 --> 00:26:36,863
And i'd forgotten
all about this thing,

584
00:26:36,896 --> 00:26:39,866
But he had fuckin' not.

585
00:26:44,403 --> 00:26:45,604
I don't know
if you know this,

586
00:26:45,638 --> 00:26:50,009
But kevin costner has a tv.

587
00:26:50,042 --> 00:26:53,746
And occasionally
he can't sleep.

588
00:26:53,780 --> 00:26:55,247
Oh, fuck, it was awful.

589
00:26:55,281 --> 00:26:56,448
He got right in my face
about it.

590
00:26:56,482 --> 00:26:58,718
He was like...

591
00:26:58,751 --> 00:27:00,953
And i was like...

592
00:27:00,987 --> 00:27:03,355
And he was like...

593
00:27:03,389 --> 00:27:06,425
And i was like...

594
00:27:06,458 --> 00:27:08,828
And he was like...

595
00:27:08,861 --> 00:27:10,262
Anyway, i talked to him
for a while,

596
00:27:10,296 --> 00:27:11,831
And he's not a bad guy,
kevin costner,

597
00:27:11,864 --> 00:27:12,765
As it turned out.

598
00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:14,400
I felt terrible.
I just felt awful.

599
00:27:14,433 --> 00:27:16,002
I thought, "oh, i'm a dick.

600
00:27:16,035 --> 00:27:17,837
"I'm a fuckin' dick.

601
00:27:17,870 --> 00:27:20,740
And now kevin costner hates me.
Bah."

602
00:27:24,576 --> 00:27:27,246
So, no, i...i...really,
i felt awful about it,

603
00:27:27,279 --> 00:27:28,614
And i thought,
you know, from now on,

604
00:27:28,647 --> 00:27:30,717
I'm gonna try
and not offend celebrities

605
00:27:30,750 --> 00:27:32,752
If i can avoid it,
but you can't fuckin' avoid it.

606
00:27:32,785 --> 00:27:33,720
You can't.

607
00:27:33,753 --> 00:27:35,221
I mean,
you can upset them...

608
00:27:35,254 --> 00:27:38,657
Some of them
have very fragile egos.

609
00:27:38,691 --> 00:27:41,027
I know.
It was news to me.

610
00:27:41,060 --> 00:27:43,029
In fact,
that's the noise i made.

611
00:27:47,834 --> 00:27:49,101
No, you can upset people

612
00:27:49,135 --> 00:27:50,669
Without even knowing
you're doing it.

613
00:27:50,703 --> 00:27:53,172
I got into terrible trouble
with the actress kate winslet,

614
00:27:53,205 --> 00:27:56,242
And i didn't even know until we
tried to book her on the show.

615
00:27:56,275 --> 00:27:58,110
And the bookers
called up her agent,

616
00:27:58,144 --> 00:28:00,612
And her agent said, "kate will
never be on that show.

617
00:28:00,646 --> 00:28:02,281
Not after what craig
said about her."

618
00:28:02,314 --> 00:28:03,983
I was like, "i never said
anything about her.

619
00:28:04,016 --> 00:28:06,452
I never said a...
oh, yeah, i did, yeah..."

620
00:28:10,222 --> 00:28:11,924
Well, i wasn't really
talking about her.

621
00:28:11,958 --> 00:28:14,727
I was talking about the movie
titanic, which she was in.

622
00:28:14,761 --> 00:28:15,962
And i love that movie.

623
00:28:15,995 --> 00:28:18,430
I love the movie titanic.
It's a great movie.

624
00:28:18,464 --> 00:28:20,532
I particularly enjoy the work
of leonardo dicaprio.

625
00:28:20,566 --> 00:28:21,600
I think he's a great actor.

626
00:28:21,633 --> 00:28:23,202
Fat, thin, beard, no beard,
happy, sad.

627
00:28:23,235 --> 00:28:26,538
He can do fuckin' everything.
And...

628
00:28:26,572 --> 00:28:28,074
I have only one problem.

629
00:28:28,107 --> 00:28:29,909
At the end of that movie
when they're, you know...

630
00:28:29,942 --> 00:28:32,078
They're in the water,
the ship sunk,

631
00:28:32,111 --> 00:28:33,913
And she's on the door
and he's in the water,

632
00:28:33,946 --> 00:28:37,850
And he's like,
"i'm dying."

633
00:28:37,884 --> 00:28:39,151
He's really good,
isn't he?

634
00:28:39,185 --> 00:28:42,288
I mean,
that's how good he is.

635
00:28:44,190 --> 00:28:45,691
He's like, "i'm...i'm dying.

636
00:28:45,724 --> 00:28:48,027
It's so...so cold.
I'm dying."

637
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:49,428
And she's like,
"yes, you are dying.

638
00:28:49,461 --> 00:28:51,130
It's terribly sad.
Bye."

639
00:28:55,234 --> 00:28:56,602
I'm thinking,
you know what?

640
00:28:56,635 --> 00:28:58,771
There's room on that door
for two people, right there.

641
00:28:58,805 --> 00:29:00,706
I mean,
this isn't some hardwood

642
00:29:00,739 --> 00:29:03,109
Piece of shit
we're talking about.

643
00:29:03,142 --> 00:29:05,177
This is a giant door

644
00:29:05,211 --> 00:29:08,047
Built in the shipyards
of belfast by union members.

645
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:11,117
This is a big...this has been
curled and worked at.

646
00:29:11,150 --> 00:29:12,218
There's brass fittings on...

647
00:29:12,251 --> 00:29:14,086
This motherfucker
is mahogany.

648
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:16,188
This is a big, big door.

649
00:29:16,222 --> 00:29:21,693
Cuban families come to america
on doors like this.

650
00:29:27,233 --> 00:29:29,668
By the way,
a word of advice,

651
00:29:29,701 --> 00:29:32,438
Never say that in miami.

652
00:29:36,742 --> 00:29:39,578
Anyway, i had a problem
with the logic at the end,

653
00:29:39,611 --> 00:29:41,580
'Cause i thought the two of them
would get on the door,

654
00:29:41,613 --> 00:29:43,049
So i...you know,
i was talking about it,

655
00:29:43,082 --> 00:29:44,216
And i'm a passionate person.

656
00:29:44,250 --> 00:29:46,152
I was getting involved
and talking about it,

657
00:29:46,185 --> 00:29:48,654
And in the heat
of the moment i said,

658
00:29:48,687 --> 00:29:50,857
"Oh, come on, kate.
Move over, you fat bitch."

659
00:29:50,890 --> 00:29:52,324
Now i don't mean...

660
00:29:52,358 --> 00:29:56,896
Hey, let me finish.

661
00:29:56,929 --> 00:30:01,400
Let me finish.

662
00:30:01,433 --> 00:30:03,402
I don't mean she's fat.
She's not fat.

663
00:30:03,435 --> 00:30:05,137
She's not fat.
And even if she was fat,

664
00:30:05,171 --> 00:30:06,705
I wouldn't comment
on a woman's weight.

665
00:30:06,738 --> 00:30:08,074
What am i?
I'm fuckin' suicidal?

666
00:30:08,107 --> 00:30:09,241
I'm not an idiot.

667
00:30:09,275 --> 00:30:10,742
I don't comment
on a woman's weight.

668
00:30:10,776 --> 00:30:11,743
I'm post feminism.

669
00:30:11,777 --> 00:30:13,579
I understand.
I'm a reconstructed man.

670
00:30:13,612 --> 00:30:15,214
I'm like,
"keep your fuckin' mouth shut."

671
00:30:15,247 --> 00:30:16,415
I understand it.

672
00:30:16,448 --> 00:30:18,117
I would never comment
on a woman's weight.

673
00:30:18,150 --> 00:30:19,218
I don't do it.

674
00:30:19,251 --> 00:30:20,519
I don't think
it's right to do it.

675
00:30:20,552 --> 00:30:22,254
And i felt ter...
and i struggle with it too.

676
00:30:22,288 --> 00:30:24,723
I...i feel your pain, sisters.

677
00:30:28,694 --> 00:30:30,696
So i...honestly,
i felt terrible,

678
00:30:30,729 --> 00:30:32,131
So i called up
the agent myself.

679
00:30:32,164 --> 00:30:34,000
I went, "you know what?
God, i feel awful about this.

680
00:30:34,033 --> 00:30:35,034
"This is a terrible thing.

681
00:30:35,067 --> 00:30:36,368
"Look, let's get kate
on the show,

682
00:30:36,402 --> 00:30:37,636
"And we'll do a show
about this,

683
00:30:37,669 --> 00:30:38,637
"'Cause this is bullshit.

684
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:39,972
"I don't want to be that guy.

685
00:30:40,006 --> 00:30:41,740
"I don't want to be that guy.
I'm not that guy.

686
00:30:41,773 --> 00:30:43,475
"We'll get her on the show,
we'll talk about it.

687
00:30:43,509 --> 00:30:45,377
"I'll say i'm a sorry.
I'm a dick. I'm a douchebag.

688
00:30:45,411 --> 00:30:46,845
She's gorgeous.
We'll do all that."

689
00:30:46,879 --> 00:30:49,381
And the agent said,
"i'll just have to call someone,

690
00:30:49,415 --> 00:30:50,382
And i'll call you back."

691
00:30:50,416 --> 00:30:51,483
And i went, "oh, right."

692
00:30:51,517 --> 00:30:53,052
And she called me back
five minutes later

693
00:30:53,085 --> 00:30:55,754
And said, "kate will never
be on your show."

694
00:30:55,787 --> 00:30:58,524
And i said, "fine.
Tell her she's a fat bitch."

695
00:30:58,557 --> 00:31:04,763
But...

696
00:31:04,796 --> 00:31:07,066
But she's not.

697
00:31:07,099 --> 00:31:10,036
She's not a fat bitch.

698
00:31:13,105 --> 00:31:14,941
I...
i don't know the woman at all.

699
00:31:14,974 --> 00:31:16,208
I never met her in my life.

700
00:31:16,242 --> 00:31:18,010
I'm sure she's a lovely woman
in every way.

701
00:31:18,044 --> 00:31:19,578
Well, not every way.
She's an actress.

702
00:31:19,611 --> 00:31:21,113
She's probably
a fuckin' sociopath.

703
00:31:21,147 --> 00:31:24,150
But...

704
00:31:24,183 --> 00:31:25,952
But she's not a fat sociopath.

705
00:31:25,985 --> 00:31:26,885
And you know what?

706
00:31:26,919 --> 00:31:28,654
Even if she was fat,
even if she was,

707
00:31:28,687 --> 00:31:30,156
I wouldn't care,
'cause i like that.

708
00:31:30,189 --> 00:31:31,823
Huh.

709
00:31:31,857 --> 00:31:32,992
Yeah, that's right.

710
00:31:33,025 --> 00:31:34,360
I said it. I like it.

711
00:31:34,393 --> 00:31:36,929
I like a woman
with a bit of unh!

712
00:31:36,963 --> 00:31:40,232
I do.
I like a bit of "ooh, yeah."

713
00:31:40,266 --> 00:31:42,134
I like a bit of
"let's get you up the stairs."

714
00:31:42,168 --> 00:31:44,003
I like all of that.

715
00:31:44,036 --> 00:31:44,971
I do. I like...

716
00:31:45,004 --> 00:31:47,173
I like to slap
and then watch the wave.

717
00:31:47,206 --> 00:31:49,775
I like all of that.

718
00:31:53,712 --> 00:31:55,447
There's a name for men like me

719
00:31:55,481 --> 00:31:56,448
That like women like that.

720
00:31:56,482 --> 00:32:01,153
We're called heterosexuals.

721
00:32:01,187 --> 00:32:05,124
That's right.
That's right.

722
00:32:05,157 --> 00:32:08,594
Ladies, if your man likes you
to be too skinny,

723
00:32:08,627 --> 00:32:11,097
Very, very skinny,
he's not your husband.

724
00:32:11,130 --> 00:32:14,800
He's your gay friend.

725
00:32:14,833 --> 00:32:16,435
"Someone's looking
a little bit fat."

726
00:32:16,468 --> 00:32:21,007
"Really? Someone's looking
a little bit gay."

727
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:23,342
You're welcome, girls.
Use it anytime.

728
00:32:23,375 --> 00:32:24,343
Anytime you like.

729
00:32:24,376 --> 00:32:25,944
For free and for fun.

730
00:32:25,978 --> 00:32:28,547
My gift to you.
Anytime you like.

731
00:32:28,580 --> 00:32:32,584
Use it.
Enjoy your fries.

732
00:32:32,618 --> 00:32:33,752
Anyway,
what i'm saying is,

733
00:32:33,785 --> 00:32:35,121
I have to deal
with the celebrities

734
00:32:35,154 --> 00:32:36,622
And then fuckin'
teach them a lesson

735
00:32:36,655 --> 00:32:37,689
When they get into trouble.

736
00:32:37,723 --> 00:32:38,757
And my heart's not in it.

737
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:40,926
The worst one
was when i had to do

738
00:32:40,959 --> 00:32:42,461
The david letterman
sex scandal.

739
00:32:42,494 --> 00:32:45,297
I was like, "oh, fuck.
Really? Thanks."

740
00:32:45,331 --> 00:32:46,765
'Cause i don't know
if you know.

741
00:32:46,798 --> 00:32:49,268
David letterman is my boss,
right?

742
00:32:49,301 --> 00:32:51,570
Now this is my boss, and he's
caught in a sex scandal.

743
00:32:51,603 --> 00:32:52,938
Now the job is, you know,

744
00:32:52,971 --> 00:32:54,773
Make fun of the people who
are caught in the sex scandal,

745
00:32:54,806 --> 00:32:55,941
But in this case,
it's my boss.

746
00:32:55,974 --> 00:32:57,143
Now i have to do the job,

747
00:32:57,176 --> 00:32:59,778
But i'd quite like
to keep the fuckin' job.

748
00:32:59,811 --> 00:33:03,482
It's like trying to do a rubik's
cube in a burning building.

749
00:33:03,515 --> 00:33:05,451
I was like...

750
00:33:06,952 --> 00:33:11,557
Shit. Shit. Shit.

751
00:33:11,590 --> 00:33:13,892
Actually, when i first heard
about dave's sex scandal,

752
00:33:13,925 --> 00:33:15,261
I shat my pants.

753
00:33:15,294 --> 00:33:19,265
It was awful, because...

754
00:33:19,298 --> 00:33:22,601
What, you can't say
"shat your pants" in nashville?

755
00:33:22,634 --> 00:33:27,773
All right. I soiled my britches
when i heard about it.

756
00:33:32,478 --> 00:33:34,180
What i mean is, i got afraid,

757
00:33:34,213 --> 00:33:36,415
Because i was walking around
the house in the morning,

758
00:33:36,448 --> 00:33:38,417
And the tv was on,
and i wasn't paying attention.

759
00:33:38,450 --> 00:33:40,519
I was just doing my thing,
getting ready and stuff.

760
00:33:40,552 --> 00:33:41,520
And the tv news was on,

761
00:33:41,553 --> 00:33:42,821
And i heard the anchorman say,

762
00:33:42,854 --> 00:33:45,023
"Cbs late night host
caught in sex scandal."

763
00:33:45,057 --> 00:33:46,592
I was like,
"fabio, you bitch!"

764
00:33:46,625 --> 00:33:48,394
And then i was like, "oh..."

765
00:33:54,100 --> 00:33:57,069
What can i tell you?
I like big women.

766
00:33:58,804 --> 00:34:00,572
Do you remember?
I'm gonna get to this joke.

767
00:34:00,606 --> 00:34:01,873
Do you remember when...

768
00:34:01,907 --> 00:34:06,178
Do you remember when fabio
got hit in the face by a goose?

769
00:34:06,212 --> 00:34:07,146
Remember that?

770
00:34:07,179 --> 00:34:08,780
Fabio did...

771
00:34:08,814 --> 00:34:11,350
They were opening a new
amusement park somewhere.

772
00:34:11,383 --> 00:34:12,984
I think it was in florida
or the midwest.

773
00:34:13,018 --> 00:34:14,353
Busch gardens,
it was called.

774
00:34:14,386 --> 00:34:17,689
I'd go. That's a great name,
actually, busch gardens.

775
00:34:17,723 --> 00:34:19,825
Busch gardens?
You had me at "busch."

776
00:34:19,858 --> 00:34:22,594
But they...

777
00:34:22,628 --> 00:34:24,996
But they were opening up
this new amusement park.

778
00:34:25,030 --> 00:34:26,165
This is a true story.

779
00:34:26,198 --> 00:34:27,799
And they said, "we need
to get a celebrity,"

780
00:34:27,833 --> 00:34:29,335
You know,
for this new amusement park.

781
00:34:29,368 --> 00:34:31,103
Someone that's gonna
bring in the kids.

782
00:34:31,137 --> 00:34:32,204
They're like, "oh, fabio."

783
00:34:32,238 --> 00:34:33,672
And they go with fabio.

784
00:34:33,705 --> 00:34:35,907
And it was the first ride
of the roller coaster,

785
00:34:35,941 --> 00:34:37,276
And fabio was gonna be,
you know,

786
00:34:37,309 --> 00:34:40,846
The first guy to ride the roller
coaster at busch gardens.

787
00:34:47,553 --> 00:34:49,388
But they have the...
they had this thing.

788
00:34:49,421 --> 00:34:51,823
Fabio was in the front car,
and it started up.

789
00:34:51,857 --> 00:34:54,393
And it was kinda going...

790
00:34:54,426 --> 00:34:56,328
Going up the thing, the hill,
for the first time,

791
00:34:56,362 --> 00:34:57,663
And fabio was sitting there,

792
00:34:57,696 --> 00:34:59,631
And his shirt was open
and his hair's all blowing.

793
00:34:59,665 --> 00:35:00,799
He's like, "aah..."

794
00:35:00,832 --> 00:35:03,769
It wasn't even windy.
He can just do that.

795
00:35:07,072 --> 00:35:08,574
He was like, "aah..."

796
00:35:08,607 --> 00:35:11,677
And just as it got to the top,
just the...

797
00:35:11,710 --> 00:35:12,911
A goose is flying by.

798
00:35:12,944 --> 00:35:14,946
And the goose went,
"fucking hell. Is that fabio?

799
00:35:14,980 --> 00:35:18,049
What the...aah!"

800
00:35:18,083 --> 00:35:19,551
And as the goose is dying,

801
00:35:19,585 --> 00:35:23,589
It's thinking, "what are
the fucking odds of this?

802
00:35:23,622 --> 00:35:28,994
Death by fabio?"

803
00:35:29,027 --> 00:35:31,397
But they had to do an emergency
stop of the roller coaster,

804
00:35:31,430 --> 00:35:32,798
And they
brought it around quick,

805
00:35:32,831 --> 00:35:35,301
And fabio was all fucked up.

806
00:35:35,334 --> 00:35:37,636
He was all...
oh, it was terrible.

807
00:35:37,669 --> 00:35:38,604
No, you shouldn't laugh.

808
00:35:38,637 --> 00:35:40,306
It was awful.
He was all mad.

809
00:35:40,339 --> 00:35:41,273
He was angry.

810
00:35:41,307 --> 00:35:43,041
There was feathers
and beak marks.

811
00:35:43,074 --> 00:35:45,076
Little webbed
footprints and stuff.

812
00:35:45,110 --> 00:35:46,578
And he was all...
"aah."

813
00:35:46,612 --> 00:35:48,980
He looked like he'd been eating
a live chicken or something.

814
00:35:49,014 --> 00:35:52,684
He's like...

815
00:35:52,718 --> 00:35:54,520
And he...but he was okay.

816
00:35:54,553 --> 00:35:56,555
But a couple of days later...
this is true.

817
00:35:56,588 --> 00:35:59,258
He tried to start a kind of
we are the world thing

818
00:35:59,291 --> 00:36:00,926
For people that had been
hit in the face

819
00:36:00,959 --> 00:36:03,695
By geese while riding
on roller coasters.

820
00:36:03,729 --> 00:36:05,931
That's true!

821
00:36:05,964 --> 00:36:08,867
* we were hit by geese

822
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:11,970
* it really hurt

823
00:36:12,003 --> 00:36:14,840
* the little beak
went in my cheek *

824
00:36:14,873 --> 00:36:18,410
* and now i'm fucked...

825
00:36:18,444 --> 00:36:20,111
But, actually,
it didn't work out,

826
00:36:20,145 --> 00:36:21,747
Because, you know,
they looked it up,

827
00:36:21,780 --> 00:36:23,148
And they're like,

828
00:36:23,181 --> 00:36:25,617
"Actually, in the history of the
human race and roller coasters,

829
00:36:25,651 --> 00:36:27,319
This has never
fuckin' happened before."

830
00:36:27,353 --> 00:36:30,789
The odds are astronomical!

831
00:36:30,822 --> 00:36:33,158
This could never happen,
but it did.

832
00:36:33,191 --> 00:36:34,293
And you know what?

833
00:36:34,326 --> 00:36:36,127
See, when something
that unlikely happens,

834
00:36:36,161 --> 00:36:38,464
Something that weirdly
out of the ordinary,

835
00:36:38,497 --> 00:36:40,832
That, to me,
proves the existence of god.

836
00:36:40,866 --> 00:36:42,067
Proves it.

837
00:36:42,100 --> 00:36:44,570
You know god exists
and god has a sense of humor.

838
00:36:44,603 --> 00:36:46,372
'Cause god's watching fabio,
and he's like,

839
00:36:46,405 --> 00:36:48,674
"Is that fabio?"

840
00:36:53,111 --> 00:36:55,146
"How does he do that thing
with the shirt and the hair?

841
00:36:55,180 --> 00:36:57,483
It's not even windy
over here."

842
00:37:03,054 --> 00:37:04,323
"Hey, come here
and look at this.

843
00:37:04,356 --> 00:37:06,458
"Come here, come here.

844
00:37:06,492 --> 00:37:07,526
"Just come here.

845
00:37:07,559 --> 00:37:10,161
It's...it'll be fun.
Come here."

846
00:37:12,664 --> 00:37:15,467
"Yeah, i'm gonna.
I'm gonna.

847
00:37:15,501 --> 00:37:17,669
"Yes, i am.

848
00:37:17,703 --> 00:37:20,171
Boom. Yeah!"

849
00:37:31,417 --> 00:37:35,687
How do you feel now,
atheists?

850
00:37:35,721 --> 00:37:38,256
Think about that when you're
driving home in your prius,

851
00:37:38,290 --> 00:37:41,693
You fuckin' hippie.

852
00:37:41,727 --> 00:37:43,962
That's right.
I said it.

853
00:37:43,995 --> 00:37:46,164
I said it.

854
00:37:46,197 --> 00:37:49,267
Get an engine,
you communist.

855
00:37:49,301 --> 00:37:52,471
I don't like you, and i don't
like your fuckin' little car.

856
00:37:52,504 --> 00:37:55,106
I don't like them priuses.
They're too quiet.

857
00:37:55,140 --> 00:37:56,942
I feel like i'm gonna
wake up one night

858
00:37:56,975 --> 00:37:59,110
And there'll be one
at the end of my bed.

859
00:38:04,483 --> 00:38:07,519
"I recycle."
"Do you?"

860
00:38:14,726 --> 00:38:17,429
That's how i've proved to myself
the existence of god.

861
00:38:17,463 --> 00:38:19,230
I now no longer have
a struggle with faith.

862
00:38:19,264 --> 00:38:20,932
I've proved to myself
the existence of god.

863
00:38:20,966 --> 00:38:23,535
I will prove to you right now
tonight the existence of god

864
00:38:23,569 --> 00:38:25,270
Using my unlikeliness theory.

865
00:38:25,303 --> 00:38:27,506
Right? Here it is,
the unlikeliness theory.

866
00:38:27,539 --> 00:38:29,708
I will prove to you now
the existence of god.

867
00:38:29,741 --> 00:38:33,879
Siegfried and roy.

868
00:38:33,912 --> 00:38:35,847
Bear with me.

869
00:38:35,881 --> 00:38:38,717
For this we have
to go back in time.

870
00:38:38,750 --> 00:38:41,787
We're going back in time
to vienna, austria.

871
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:44,390
It's 1974.

872
00:38:44,423 --> 00:38:45,824
There's a little fog
in the street.

873
00:38:45,857 --> 00:38:46,792
Just that little fog,

874
00:38:46,825 --> 00:38:50,228
Like a smashing pumpkins
video.

875
00:38:52,698 --> 00:38:54,933
A young man
is walking the streets.

876
00:38:54,966 --> 00:38:57,436
He is forlorn and dejected.

877
00:38:57,469 --> 00:39:00,138
His name is siegfried.

878
00:39:00,171 --> 00:39:04,376
"I am forlorn
and dejected.

879
00:39:04,410 --> 00:39:07,446
"I am doomed
to a life of loneliness,

880
00:39:07,479 --> 00:39:10,616
"For no one will ever
share my interests.

881
00:39:10,649 --> 00:39:15,320
My only two interests
are lion taming and cock."

882
00:39:20,992 --> 00:39:23,629
"Who in all of austria

883
00:39:23,662 --> 00:39:28,634
Would also be interested
in lion taming and cock?"

884
00:39:28,667 --> 00:39:30,101
"Hi, siegfried.
I'm roy.

885
00:39:30,135 --> 00:39:33,672
I'm also interested
in lion taming and cock."

886
00:39:33,705 --> 00:39:37,342
Two gay austrian
lion tamers?

887
00:39:37,375 --> 00:39:40,011
What are the fuckin'
odds of that?

888
00:39:40,045 --> 00:39:41,847
What are the odds of that?

889
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:43,782
"I also like white tigers."

890
00:39:43,815 --> 00:39:46,452
"I love white tigers!"

891
00:39:49,655 --> 00:39:53,391
How do you feel now,
atheists?

892
00:39:53,425 --> 00:39:55,461
Let me ask you a question,
atheists,

893
00:39:55,494 --> 00:39:58,497
When you're driving home
in them little priuses.

894
00:39:58,530 --> 00:40:00,398
Who do you call on
when the brakes fail

895
00:40:00,432 --> 00:40:02,901
In that little shit box?

896
00:40:10,041 --> 00:40:11,409
"Oh, no. Help me,

897
00:40:11,443 --> 00:40:13,945
Spontaneous
chemical reaction."

898
00:40:16,582 --> 00:40:17,549
What am i talking about?

899
00:40:17,583 --> 00:40:18,817
Oh, yeah, dave sex scandal.

900
00:40:18,850 --> 00:40:20,919
The dave sex scandal
was terrible, terrible for me.

901
00:40:20,952 --> 00:40:22,921
The only thing
that i was grateful for,

902
00:40:22,954 --> 00:40:24,856
There was no sex tape.

903
00:40:24,890 --> 00:40:26,191
'Cause, you know,
i love dave,

904
00:40:26,224 --> 00:40:29,360
But i don't want
to see that.

905
00:40:32,330 --> 00:40:33,832
Actually, i don't watch
the sex tapes.

906
00:40:33,865 --> 00:40:36,234
I try not to watch
the celebrity sex videotapes,

907
00:40:36,267 --> 00:40:38,737
'Cause a lot of these people
are gonna be on the show,

908
00:40:38,770 --> 00:40:40,071
And i don't want that
in my head

909
00:40:40,105 --> 00:40:41,607
When i meet someone
for the first time.

910
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:43,875
Like, "oh, yeah, i remember
his cock from the internet.

911
00:40:43,909 --> 00:40:45,410
How you doing?"

912
00:40:45,443 --> 00:40:47,646
That's why tommy lee
has never been on the show,

913
00:40:47,679 --> 00:40:49,447
'Cause i've seen that one.

914
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:03,695
Actually,
before i saw that video,

915
00:41:03,729 --> 00:41:07,132
I didn't know
tommy lee was scottish.

916
00:41:12,504 --> 00:41:14,806
And the other one that
i wish i'd seen but i never saw

917
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:17,008
Were the carrie prejean
sex tapes.

918
00:41:17,042 --> 00:41:18,276
Do you remember
carrie prejean?

919
00:41:18,309 --> 00:41:20,111
She was a miss california
beauty queen.

920
00:41:20,145 --> 00:41:23,314
No, you don't, but thanks.
Uh...

921
00:41:23,348 --> 00:41:26,017
"I haven't
made a noise for a while.

922
00:41:26,051 --> 00:41:28,386
Aah!"

923
00:41:28,419 --> 00:41:30,622
Carrie prejean

924
00:41:30,656 --> 00:41:32,691
Was a miss california
beauty queen

925
00:41:32,724 --> 00:41:35,160
Who became miss usa, and she got
into terrible trouble,

926
00:41:35,193 --> 00:41:36,995
Because during
the question-And-Answer part

927
00:41:37,028 --> 00:41:39,297
Of the beauty pageant, you know,
when they grill the girls

928
00:41:39,330 --> 00:41:41,399
To find out if they're smart
enough to be beauty queens,

929
00:41:41,432 --> 00:41:42,701
They...

930
00:41:45,003 --> 00:41:48,239
If you don't get this right,
you're ugly.

931
00:41:50,175 --> 00:41:55,046
And by the way, beauty
is decided by donald trump?

932
00:41:56,682 --> 00:41:59,084
That's like a midget deciding
who's the tallest.

933
00:41:59,117 --> 00:42:01,553
What the fuck?

934
00:42:03,589 --> 00:42:06,391
Did you "ooh" me
for donald trump?

935
00:42:06,424 --> 00:42:09,360
Fucking seriously?

936
00:42:09,394 --> 00:42:11,429
Anyway, carrie prejean
was this...

937
00:42:11,462 --> 00:42:12,698
She got into terrible trouble,

938
00:42:12,731 --> 00:42:15,166
'Cause during
the question-And-Answer thing,

939
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:16,835
It came out that she was
against gay marriage.

940
00:42:16,868 --> 00:42:18,436
So all the people
that are for gay marriage

941
00:42:18,469 --> 00:42:19,671
Were like, "what?"

942
00:42:19,705 --> 00:42:21,239
And all the people
that were against gay marriage

943
00:42:21,272 --> 00:42:22,540
Were like, "hooray!"

944
00:42:22,574 --> 00:42:25,677
But then her time in the media
was fucked up,

945
00:42:25,711 --> 00:42:28,914
Because sex tapes came out
where, apparently,

946
00:42:28,947 --> 00:42:31,549
She had been sending sex tapes
to her boyfriend on her phone...

947
00:42:31,583 --> 00:42:33,418
Just of her,
just her on her own,

948
00:42:33,451 --> 00:42:34,519
No one else in the tape,

949
00:42:34,552 --> 00:42:36,955
Which i think is a level
of confidence

950
00:42:36,988 --> 00:42:39,791
I could only aspire to.

951
00:42:39,825 --> 00:42:41,226
That's amazing.

952
00:42:41,259 --> 00:42:43,094
"I'm making a sex tape."
"Really? Who's in it?"

953
00:42:43,128 --> 00:42:44,295
"Just me."

954
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:52,237
"Who else do you need?"

955
00:42:52,270 --> 00:42:53,905
Actually,
when a woman does that,

956
00:42:53,939 --> 00:42:56,942
That's...that's
actually awesome.

957
00:42:56,975 --> 00:42:58,043
Now, women...that'd be great.

958
00:42:58,076 --> 00:42:59,711
A man should never
do that, though.

959
00:42:59,745 --> 00:43:02,280
Never send...no woman wants
to see that on her phone.

960
00:43:02,313 --> 00:43:03,849
That would be bad.

961
00:43:03,882 --> 00:43:04,950
Ugh.

962
00:43:04,983 --> 00:43:06,417
Here's me thinking
about you, honey.

963
00:43:06,451 --> 00:43:08,153
Whaa-Ha!

964
00:43:10,188 --> 00:43:13,625
Can't wait to see you tonight.

965
00:43:15,426 --> 00:43:19,564
A woman would get that on her
phone...she'd be like, "aah!

966
00:43:19,597 --> 00:43:24,269
Ah, take out my eyes!
I can never use them again!"

967
00:43:24,302 --> 00:43:26,872
She got into terrible trouble,
this carrie prejean woman,

968
00:43:26,905 --> 00:43:30,275
And she had to go on larry king
to defend herself.

969
00:43:30,308 --> 00:43:32,243
By the way, i love larry king.
I do.

970
00:43:32,277 --> 00:43:35,580
I really love larry king,
and i hate that he's retiring

971
00:43:35,613 --> 00:43:39,350
And being replaced
by some british fuck.

972
00:43:39,384 --> 00:43:41,486
We don't need foreigners
on american television.

973
00:43:41,519 --> 00:43:43,822
What the fuck is going on?

974
00:43:43,855 --> 00:43:45,824
That's right!

975
00:43:49,160 --> 00:43:51,529
She had to go...

976
00:43:51,562 --> 00:43:53,932
I do. I love larry king.
I do.

977
00:43:53,965 --> 00:43:56,334
Larry king is...like, that's
the way you should grow old,

978
00:43:56,367 --> 00:43:57,302
Like larry king.

979
00:43:57,335 --> 00:43:59,104
Larry king typifies,
for me,

980
00:43:59,137 --> 00:44:01,039
The spirit
of the punk-Rock movement.

981
00:44:01,072 --> 00:44:02,874
Absolutely, 'cause he's like...

982
00:44:02,908 --> 00:44:04,509
You know, like you young people,
you're like,

983
00:44:04,542 --> 00:44:06,011
"I don't give a fuck
what you think, man."

984
00:44:06,044 --> 00:44:07,078
You give a fuck.

985
00:44:07,112 --> 00:44:08,479
You comb your hair.
You wear deodorant.

986
00:44:08,513 --> 00:44:13,151
Larry doesn't fucking give
a shit about any of that.

987
00:44:13,184 --> 00:44:16,154
Larry doesn't give a fuck
what you think.

988
00:44:16,187 --> 00:44:17,622
It's true.
I've been on his show.

989
00:44:17,655 --> 00:44:19,457
Larry will look you
directly in the eyes,

990
00:44:19,490 --> 00:44:23,995
Fart really loudly,
and not break eye contact.

991
00:44:24,029 --> 00:44:28,199
It's like...

992
00:44:40,879 --> 00:44:42,247
What's wrong?

993
00:44:42,280 --> 00:44:44,215
Don't you like brisket?

994
00:44:47,719 --> 00:44:49,821
I fucking love
larry king...i love him.

995
00:44:49,855 --> 00:44:51,723
That's the way i want
to grow old, like larry king,

996
00:44:51,757 --> 00:44:54,592
Not giving a fuck.

997
00:44:54,625 --> 00:44:56,027
That's how you get old.

998
00:44:56,061 --> 00:44:58,063
Like, see, when i was a young
comedian in the comedy clubs...

999
00:44:58,096 --> 00:44:59,497
I was, like, 23, 24...

1000
00:44:59,530 --> 00:45:01,833
I was like, "all the older
comedians are hacks, man.

1001
00:45:01,867 --> 00:45:03,969
They're all assholes.
They're all fucking hacks."

1002
00:45:04,002 --> 00:45:05,070
But now, you see, i'm 48,

1003
00:45:05,103 --> 00:45:06,704
And i hear
the young comedians talking,

1004
00:45:06,738 --> 00:45:10,008
And i'm like,
"shut the fuck up, you douche."

1005
00:45:10,041 --> 00:45:12,677
And stop touching your groin
when you're telling jokes.

1006
00:45:12,710 --> 00:45:15,947
It doesn't make you edgy.
It just looks dirty.

1007
00:45:15,981 --> 00:45:20,385
They're like, "hi, everybody.
I'm edgy. Whoa, oh, oh."

1008
00:45:20,418 --> 00:45:25,256
"Here's a new style of comedy...
me touching my cock."

1009
00:45:26,958 --> 00:45:30,095
I don't have to keep doing this.
I just like doing this.

1010
00:45:31,729 --> 00:45:34,933
"Hey, everybody. I'm edgy.
I'm edgy. Mm-Hmm.

1011
00:45:34,966 --> 00:45:36,802
"Have you ever noticed
how some things

1012
00:45:36,835 --> 00:45:40,105
Are like other things?"

1013
00:45:40,138 --> 00:45:43,641
Now, i'm 48 years old.
I've been married three times.

1014
00:45:43,674 --> 00:45:44,876
I've been through rehab.

1015
00:45:44,910 --> 00:45:48,613
My balls touch my ankles
when i stand up, but, no...

1016
00:45:48,646 --> 00:45:50,949
I never noticed how some things
are like other things.

1017
00:45:50,982 --> 00:45:54,052
Shut up!

1018
00:45:54,085 --> 00:45:57,122
It's true.
My balls are leaving me...

1019
00:45:59,190 --> 00:46:01,059
Slowly.

1020
00:46:01,092 --> 00:46:04,896
Sometimes i feel i'm being
followed by twin hamsters.

1021
00:46:20,311 --> 00:46:23,314
Are they still there?

1022
00:46:23,348 --> 00:46:26,584
I'm getting away, though.

1023
00:46:26,617 --> 00:46:28,186
Anyway...oh, yeah,
i was gonna tell you this joke.

1024
00:46:28,219 --> 00:46:30,288
So here's the joke.

1025
00:46:30,321 --> 00:46:32,623
It's an old joke,
which means i stole it.

1026
00:46:32,657 --> 00:46:35,126
I didn't really steal it, but
if you do what i do for a living

1027
00:46:35,160 --> 00:46:36,794
And go on the internet
accidentally

1028
00:46:36,828 --> 00:46:38,997
And google yourself
accidentally...

1029
00:46:39,030 --> 00:46:41,799
Fuck you.

1030
00:46:41,833 --> 00:46:44,802
People will say that you steal
things all the time.

1031
00:46:44,836 --> 00:46:47,138
I noticed that.
This is not kidding, right?

1032
00:46:47,172 --> 00:46:49,674
I googled myself.
I don't do it anymore.

1033
00:46:51,542 --> 00:46:52,978
I googled myself by accident.

1034
00:46:53,011 --> 00:46:54,779
I came into the room,
and i tripped and fell

1035
00:46:54,812 --> 00:46:56,481
And typed my name in google
on the computer.

1036
00:46:56,514 --> 00:46:59,017
Like, oh!

1037
00:47:01,552 --> 00:47:04,189
I googled...and somebody said in
this chat room on the internet...

1038
00:47:04,222 --> 00:47:05,390
I'm not kidding.
This is true.

1039
00:47:05,423 --> 00:47:06,791
Somebody said...

1040
00:47:06,824 --> 00:47:08,659
Said,
"that craig ferguson, yeah,

1041
00:47:08,693 --> 00:47:12,030
He stole the whole scottish
thing from mike myers."

1042
00:47:15,566 --> 00:47:17,802
Now, listen, i know mike myers.
I like him.

1043
00:47:17,835 --> 00:47:22,040
He's a very nice man,
but he's canadian.

1044
00:47:26,177 --> 00:47:28,513
And in this same chat room...
i'm not kidding.

1045
00:47:28,546 --> 00:47:30,748
In the same chat room,
somebody else...this is true.

1046
00:47:30,781 --> 00:47:32,383
Somebody said, "no, no,
he didn't steal his act

1047
00:47:32,417 --> 00:47:33,384
"From mike myers.

1048
00:47:33,418 --> 00:47:36,154
He stole his act
from ellen degeneres."

1049
00:47:37,889 --> 00:47:39,991
Now, listen, i know
and like ellen degeneres.

1050
00:47:40,025 --> 00:47:42,994
She's a very nice woman,
but come on!

1051
00:47:43,028 --> 00:47:45,931
I'm not butch enough
to do ellen material.

1052
00:48:02,680 --> 00:48:05,850
I do kind of look
like an old lesbian, don't i?

1053
00:48:05,883 --> 00:48:07,418
I kind of do.
I've noticed it.

1054
00:48:07,452 --> 00:48:08,886
I know. I know.
It's all right.

1055
00:48:08,920 --> 00:48:10,721
We can just...
you know, we can talk about it.

1056
00:48:10,755 --> 00:48:12,790
Sometimes i just look
in the mirror, i'm like,

1057
00:48:12,823 --> 00:48:15,160
"Fuck, k.D. Lang."

1058
00:48:18,896 --> 00:48:21,199
There's this idea that people
are meaner than they used to be.

1059
00:48:21,232 --> 00:48:23,268
Because of the internet,
you know, people are meaner.

1060
00:48:23,301 --> 00:48:25,236
They're not meaner. People are
not meaner than they used to be.

1061
00:48:25,270 --> 00:48:27,272
People have always been
assholes, except you guys.

1062
00:48:27,305 --> 00:48:28,873
But they...

1063
00:48:28,906 --> 00:48:30,608
But they are,
and people are not meaner.

1064
00:48:30,641 --> 00:48:32,944
What happens is the technology
is just faster.

1065
00:48:32,978 --> 00:48:34,212
It's just faster.

1066
00:48:34,245 --> 00:48:36,081
What happens is,
you have this crazy idea,

1067
00:48:36,114 --> 00:48:37,815
And there's a crazy,
angry thought, and you're like,

1068
00:48:37,848 --> 00:48:39,084
"I've got a crazy,
angry thought."

1069
00:48:39,117 --> 00:48:41,452
Tickety-Tick, tick, tick, boom!
And it's out.

1070
00:48:41,486 --> 00:48:42,954
And you don't have time.

1071
00:48:42,988 --> 00:48:45,890
You don't have time to slow down
and self-Edit and ask yourself

1072
00:48:45,923 --> 00:48:47,959
The three things
you must always ask yourself

1073
00:48:47,993 --> 00:48:51,429
Before you say anything, which
is, "does this need to be said?

1074
00:48:51,462 --> 00:48:53,731
"Does this
need to be said by me?

1075
00:48:53,764 --> 00:48:56,767
Does this need to be said
by me now?"

1076
00:48:56,801 --> 00:49:00,671
Three fucking marriages
it took me to learn that.

1077
00:49:00,705 --> 00:49:02,140
Three.

1078
00:49:09,847 --> 00:49:12,350
It's like...it's the technology.
It's too fast.

1079
00:49:12,383 --> 00:49:13,751
Like, in the old days...

1080
00:49:13,784 --> 00:49:15,453
In the middle ages,
if you had a crazy thought,

1081
00:49:15,486 --> 00:49:17,022
You were like,
"i got to write this down.

1082
00:49:17,055 --> 00:49:18,756
"I'm so angry. I'm so crazy.
I'm gonna write this down.

1083
00:49:18,789 --> 00:49:20,358
"Well, i better learn
to read and write,

1084
00:49:20,391 --> 00:49:21,592
"Because it's the middle ages,

1085
00:49:21,626 --> 00:49:23,094
And only monks and priests
can read and write."

1086
00:49:23,128 --> 00:49:24,562
Right, well, okay,
a couple of years of that...

1087
00:49:24,595 --> 00:49:26,431
"I'm still angry.
I'm gonna write this down.

1088
00:49:26,464 --> 00:49:28,433
"I'm gonna need...oh, fuck it.
I'm gonna need parchment.

1089
00:49:28,466 --> 00:49:30,935
"All right, parchment
and weave the parchment.

1090
00:49:30,968 --> 00:49:32,937
"Weave the parchment.
Right, got some parchment.

1091
00:49:32,970 --> 00:49:34,839
Oh, fuck, a pen.
Give me a chicken."

1092
00:49:36,841 --> 00:49:38,276
"Right, chicken.
Oh, fuck, ink.

1093
00:49:38,309 --> 00:49:40,811
"Crush the berries.
Crush the berries.

1094
00:49:40,845 --> 00:49:43,581
"Right, parchment, berries,
pen...let's go.

1095
00:49:43,614 --> 00:49:45,116
"Right, capital letter
to start off...

1096
00:49:45,150 --> 00:49:47,618
"Big medieval capital letter
with things going around it,

1097
00:49:47,652 --> 00:49:49,454
"Little trees
and squirrelly bits.

1098
00:49:49,487 --> 00:49:51,956
"God's hand coming down...
a little castle, a tree,

1099
00:49:51,989 --> 00:49:54,025
"A brook, a dwarf,
all kind of things,

1100
00:49:54,059 --> 00:49:55,993
"Little tigers and designs.

1101
00:49:56,027 --> 00:49:58,096
You know what?
I'm just gonna let it go."

1102
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:07,004
Three weeks for the letter "f,"
30 seconds for "uck it."

1103
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:11,476
Also, of course,
with the internet,

1104
00:50:11,509 --> 00:50:13,478
You've got
that kind of hidden feeling.

1105
00:50:13,511 --> 00:50:15,313
You're kind of protected.
You're kind of...

1106
00:50:15,346 --> 00:50:16,981
You know,
you're kind of anonymous.

1107
00:50:17,014 --> 00:50:18,516
It's kind of like
in your car.

1108
00:50:18,549 --> 00:50:20,851
You're a bit more of a dick when
you drive than when you walk,

1109
00:50:20,885 --> 00:50:22,853
'Cause you're kind of protected.
It's like the same thing.

1110
00:50:22,887 --> 00:50:24,689
Like, you would never walk
like you drive.

1111
00:50:24,722 --> 00:50:26,557
You never walk up
behind somebody and go,

1112
00:50:26,591 --> 00:50:29,727
"Oh, come on, get a move on.

1113
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:31,329
"Oh!

1114
00:50:31,362 --> 00:50:32,863
"Oh, what? Come on!

1115
00:50:32,897 --> 00:50:37,402
"Oh, invisible friend,
look at this.

1116
00:50:37,435 --> 00:50:39,704
"Oh. Oh!

1117
00:50:39,737 --> 00:50:43,641
I know you're on my side, god.
Come on!"

1118
00:50:43,674 --> 00:50:45,710
Like, getting round in front
of them and slowing down...

1119
00:50:45,743 --> 00:50:48,246
"How do you
fucking like it, huh?"

1120
00:50:53,451 --> 00:50:56,454
"Learn to walk, you bastard."

1121
00:50:57,855 --> 00:51:01,359
You wouldn't do that,
'cause somebody would kill you.

1122
00:51:01,392 --> 00:51:03,161
Men are particularly bad
at this.

1123
00:51:03,194 --> 00:51:04,762
I'm as bad as any other man.

1124
00:51:04,795 --> 00:51:06,564
You know, we think
if we have a big machine,

1125
00:51:06,597 --> 00:51:09,200
A big badass machine,
like a big truck or a big car,

1126
00:51:09,234 --> 00:51:10,868
It makes us
a big badass person.

1127
00:51:10,901 --> 00:51:12,570
It doesn't.
It doesn't.

1128
00:51:12,603 --> 00:51:14,439
It makes you the owner
of a big badass machine.

1129
00:51:14,472 --> 00:51:15,706
That's all.

1130
00:51:15,740 --> 00:51:18,609
I saw a very good example
of this

1131
00:51:18,643 --> 00:51:19,877
When i used to live in london.

1132
00:51:19,910 --> 00:51:22,046
I lived in london, and i saw
a traffic accident one day

1133
00:51:22,079 --> 00:51:24,215
Between a guy
on a big italian motorcycle...

1134
00:51:24,249 --> 00:51:25,550
Beautiful, big thing,

1135
00:51:25,583 --> 00:51:27,485
A big "what's-A-Coming-A-Go,
"what's-A-Coming-A-Go"...

1136
00:51:27,518 --> 00:51:28,886
And...

1137
00:51:28,919 --> 00:51:30,955
And a little mini cooper,
you know, a little kind of...

1138
00:51:30,988 --> 00:51:32,557
Beep, beep.

1139
00:51:32,590 --> 00:51:34,492
And they had this accident.
It wasn't too bad.

1140
00:51:34,525 --> 00:51:35,593
But the bike went over,

1141
00:51:35,626 --> 00:51:37,428
And the mini cooper went
into the curb,

1142
00:51:37,462 --> 00:51:39,464
And the guy on the bike
was fucking crazy.

1143
00:51:39,497 --> 00:51:40,731
He was incensed.

1144
00:51:40,765 --> 00:51:42,233
He got up,
and he gets a bike chain.

1145
00:51:42,267 --> 00:51:43,368
He goes over to the mini,

1146
00:51:43,401 --> 00:51:45,002
And the doors are still closed
in the mini.

1147
00:51:45,035 --> 00:51:46,604
He goes over,
and he's fucking mad.

1148
00:51:46,637 --> 00:51:48,573
He gets the bike chain, and he's
like, "you crazy motherfucker!

1149
00:51:48,606 --> 00:51:50,241
You got to...

1150
00:51:50,275 --> 00:51:51,942
Well, it wasn't like that.
It was london. He was like...

1151
00:51:51,976 --> 00:51:55,246
"I'm terribly
cross with you right now."

1152
00:51:59,083 --> 00:52:01,652
"Ooh, you've made me grumpy."

1153
00:52:04,589 --> 00:52:05,890
And i know what he's thinking.

1154
00:52:05,923 --> 00:52:07,592
He's thinking, well,
the mini cooper is a small car,

1155
00:52:07,625 --> 00:52:09,126
So the person in it
is gonna be small,

1156
00:52:09,160 --> 00:52:11,296
And he's gonna be able
to bully and intimidate them.

1157
00:52:11,329 --> 00:52:12,430
And, of course, the door opens,

1158
00:52:12,463 --> 00:52:14,865
And this fucking head
starts to come out...

1159
00:52:14,899 --> 00:52:18,769
This huge, giant cockney head,
big thing,

1160
00:52:18,803 --> 00:52:23,174
No hair on the top, just bits
of bacon and fur and stuff.

1161
00:52:25,176 --> 00:52:27,111
And this guy...
like, one eye in the middle,

1162
00:52:27,144 --> 00:52:29,780
And he's like...

1163
00:52:29,814 --> 00:52:31,949
He gets up, and he...

1164
00:52:31,982 --> 00:52:34,385
And he's wearing one of them
pinkie rings that guys wear

1165
00:52:34,419 --> 00:52:36,120
When their hobby is murdering.

1166
00:52:41,192 --> 00:52:42,993
And he gets...he gets
up to his full height,

1167
00:52:43,027 --> 00:52:44,495
And he looks down at the guy,
and he's like,

1168
00:52:44,529 --> 00:52:47,832
"What the fuck
do you think you're doing?"

1169
00:52:47,865 --> 00:52:49,033
And the guy
with the chain said,

1170
00:52:49,066 --> 00:52:53,404
"I saw a bug
on the roof of your car,

1171
00:52:53,438 --> 00:52:55,673
"And...

1172
00:52:55,706 --> 00:52:58,909
"It looked like it might be
a sting-Y one.

1173
00:52:58,943 --> 00:53:00,978
I was chasing it away."

1174
00:53:01,011 --> 00:53:02,813
But what happened is,

1175
00:53:02,847 --> 00:53:05,983
He was made to be responsible
for his actions.

1176
00:53:06,016 --> 00:53:07,552
But that won't happen to you
on the internet.

1177
00:53:07,585 --> 00:53:08,819
Nobody on the internet...

1178
00:53:08,853 --> 00:53:10,588
No big cockney's gonna come
round to your house

1179
00:53:10,621 --> 00:53:11,889
If you've been on the internet

1180
00:53:11,922 --> 00:53:14,992
And stuff a bike chain
down your pants and slap you...

1181
00:53:15,025 --> 00:53:19,430
Unless you go to the right
website maybe, and then...

1182
00:53:19,464 --> 00:53:22,433
Chaindownyourpants.Com,

1183
00:53:22,467 --> 00:53:23,901
If that exists.

1184
00:53:23,934 --> 00:53:25,903
It will by midnight.

1185
00:53:28,939 --> 00:53:31,842
I'll see you there.

1186
00:53:31,876 --> 00:53:33,344
Now, i noticed when people

1187
00:53:33,378 --> 00:53:35,045
Were getting fucking mean
on the internet...

1188
00:53:35,079 --> 00:53:37,181
What happened is i accidentally
googled myself...

1189
00:53:37,214 --> 00:53:40,017
Fell over, typed my name in...
after i got married.

1190
00:53:40,050 --> 00:53:42,520
I got married again,
and i went on the internet

1191
00:53:42,553 --> 00:53:44,655
To see how happy
everyone was for me.

1192
00:53:44,689 --> 00:53:47,758
Fucking hell.

1193
00:53:47,792 --> 00:53:49,059
It was awful.

1194
00:53:49,093 --> 00:53:50,528
One woman...
i think it was a woman.

1195
00:53:50,561 --> 00:53:53,030
Her name was susan123
or something,

1196
00:53:53,063 --> 00:53:55,199
And she said,
"married again, eh?

1197
00:53:55,232 --> 00:53:58,235
Hmm. She's a user,
and he's a pervert."

1198
00:53:58,269 --> 00:54:01,171
And i'm like,
"how do they know us?"

1199
00:54:04,475 --> 00:54:06,210
I did. I got married...
i got married again.

1200
00:54:06,243 --> 00:54:08,279
I got married
to a yankee woman.

1201
00:54:09,980 --> 00:54:11,882
What?

1202
00:54:11,916 --> 00:54:15,085
You wouldn't make that noise
if you were a real yankee.

1203
00:54:15,119 --> 00:54:18,789
You'd just sit there
quietly smug in your cardigan.

1204
00:54:24,094 --> 00:54:25,763
No, i did.
I married a yankee woman

1205
00:54:25,796 --> 00:54:28,399
From up
in the new hampshire area.

1206
00:54:28,433 --> 00:54:31,101
And they're very...
very posh kind of yankees,

1207
00:54:31,135 --> 00:54:33,237
Very kind of upper-Class
yankees, which is freaky for me,

1208
00:54:33,270 --> 00:54:35,606
Because they
don't even sound american.

1209
00:54:35,640 --> 00:54:37,775
You know, they sound...
they are american,

1210
00:54:37,808 --> 00:54:39,477
But they sound
like english people.

1211
00:54:39,510 --> 00:54:41,011
They're like,
"oh, yes,

1212
00:54:41,045 --> 00:54:42,480
"We're terribly american, yes.

1213
00:54:42,513 --> 00:54:43,581
"We're terribly american.

1214
00:54:43,614 --> 00:54:47,818
We enjoy gum,
and we detest al-Qaeda."

1215
00:54:49,654 --> 00:54:50,788
They do.

1216
00:54:50,821 --> 00:54:53,324
They sound like
upper-Class english people.

1217
00:54:53,358 --> 00:54:56,327
They're so posh, they don't say
the word "yes."

1218
00:54:56,361 --> 00:54:57,795
They say, "ears."

1219
00:54:57,828 --> 00:54:59,730
They're like...you say,
"would you like a drink?"

1220
00:54:59,764 --> 00:55:00,831
They go...

1221
00:55:00,865 --> 00:55:03,167
"Ears, that would be lovely."

1222
00:55:07,171 --> 00:55:08,305
I remember that.

1223
00:55:08,339 --> 00:55:09,840
I remember that
from when i lived in london.

1224
00:55:09,874 --> 00:55:11,442
Occasionally,
when i lived in london,

1225
00:55:11,476 --> 00:55:14,379
I would have sex with a girl
from an aristocratic family.

1226
00:55:14,412 --> 00:55:16,180
And i...

1227
00:55:18,716 --> 00:55:19,950
I always enjoy doing to them

1228
00:55:19,984 --> 00:55:22,186
What their ancestors
did to my country.

1229
00:55:24,889 --> 00:55:27,024
Oh...

1230
00:55:33,664 --> 00:55:36,033
Although with me, there was
always cuddling afterwards.

1231
00:55:37,868 --> 00:55:39,303
But it's very confusing
having sex

1232
00:55:39,336 --> 00:55:40,671
With an upper-Class
english girl,

1233
00:55:40,705 --> 00:55:44,875
Because they'd be saying,
"oh, ears, ears, ears.

1234
00:55:44,909 --> 00:55:46,511
Ears! Ears!"

1235
00:55:46,544 --> 00:55:48,746
I'd be like,
"oh, all right, then."

1236
00:56:05,295 --> 00:56:07,231
And the midget would be like,
"what the hell are you doing?"

1237
00:56:07,264 --> 00:56:09,366
I'd be like, "never mind."

1238
00:56:09,400 --> 00:56:12,269
And then when they start saying,
"oh, i'm arriving.

1239
00:56:12,302 --> 00:56:15,940
I'm arriving!"

1240
00:56:18,208 --> 00:56:19,777
I'm kidding.
I never heard that.

1241
00:56:19,810 --> 00:56:22,346
But...

1242
00:56:22,379 --> 00:56:24,014
They're very strange,
though, the yankees.

1243
00:56:24,048 --> 00:56:25,382
They're very,
very strange to me.

1244
00:56:25,416 --> 00:56:27,384
They're weird.
They're so tight-Ass.

1245
00:56:27,418 --> 00:56:29,219
They're like...
"ears."

1246
00:56:29,253 --> 00:56:32,389
It's like, even when they
get drunk, they're tight-Ass.

1247
00:56:32,423 --> 00:56:35,059
Like, when my people get drunk,
we go crazy.

1248
00:56:35,092 --> 00:56:38,295
We're just like...

1249
00:56:38,328 --> 00:56:41,532
"Oh, danny boy!

1250
00:56:41,566 --> 00:56:45,369
You don't fucking know me!
You...i fucking love you!"

1251
00:56:49,474 --> 00:56:51,141
"I'm all right!
I'm all right!"

1252
00:56:53,844 --> 00:56:55,546
"I know! I'm good!"

1253
00:56:55,580 --> 00:56:58,182
Oh!

1254
00:56:58,215 --> 00:57:00,985
And the men are worse,
but when yankees get drunk...

1255
00:57:10,795 --> 00:57:12,897
When yankees get drunk,
they're just more tight-Ass.

1256
00:57:12,930 --> 00:57:17,001
You go, "are you drunk?"
They go, "ears."

1257
00:57:17,034 --> 00:57:18,268
They're like the addams family.

1258
00:57:18,302 --> 00:57:20,270
When i first met them,
they were...i go to the house,

1259
00:57:20,304 --> 00:57:21,939
There was a plate
of cookies going round,

1260
00:57:21,972 --> 00:57:23,474
And i went to take one,
and somebody said,

1261
00:57:23,508 --> 00:57:25,976
"Not that one.
That's for mother."

1262
00:57:26,010 --> 00:57:29,947
Very strange.
Not like my family at all.

1263
00:57:29,980 --> 00:57:32,082
My family aren't upper-Class
or posh or anything.

1264
00:57:32,116 --> 00:57:33,150
We're more kind of...

1265
00:57:33,183 --> 00:57:34,519
How do you describe my family?

1266
00:57:34,552 --> 00:57:35,953
Carnies, i guess.
Carnies.

1267
00:57:35,986 --> 00:57:37,287
We're kind of carnies.

1268
00:57:37,321 --> 00:57:39,456
We are, you know,
working-Class people

1269
00:57:39,490 --> 00:57:40,958
With psychic abilities.

1270
00:57:40,991 --> 00:57:42,326
That's what we are.

1271
00:57:42,359 --> 00:57:44,495
My father had a very unusual
psychic ability.

1272
00:57:44,529 --> 00:57:46,597
He could, um,
detect water.

1273
00:57:46,631 --> 00:57:47,598
It's called divining.

1274
00:57:47,632 --> 00:57:49,433
He would use a "y"- Shaped
"u" branch

1275
00:57:49,466 --> 00:57:51,401
And he could find water
with that.

1276
00:57:51,435 --> 00:57:52,737
Which is
a very impressive skill

1277
00:57:52,770 --> 00:57:55,773
In a country where it rains
365 days of the year.

1278
00:58:01,345 --> 00:58:02,980
"I think there's water
over here, son."

1279
00:58:03,013 --> 00:58:06,216
"It's a swamp, dad."

1280
00:58:06,250 --> 00:58:09,620
Not only could my father
find water with a stick.

1281
00:58:09,654 --> 00:58:12,823
He could find a bar
with his shoes.

1282
00:58:16,827 --> 00:58:18,262
Hang on, son.
Hang on.

1283
00:58:18,295 --> 00:58:19,697
Hang on.

1284
00:58:19,730 --> 00:58:20,865
Whoa, oh, what's this?

1285
00:58:20,898 --> 00:58:23,100
What's this?

1286
00:58:23,133 --> 00:58:25,269
Come on.

1287
00:58:25,302 --> 00:58:27,504
Right again!

1288
00:58:29,607 --> 00:58:31,008
I don't want to give you
the wrong impression

1289
00:58:31,041 --> 00:58:31,976
About my dad.

1290
00:58:32,009 --> 00:58:33,343
He wasn't a drunk
or an alcoholic.

1291
00:58:33,377 --> 00:58:34,444
He was just scottish.

1292
00:58:34,478 --> 00:58:37,648
I became a terrible drunk
or alcoholic...

1293
00:58:37,682 --> 00:58:38,749
Or a good one,

1294
00:58:38,783 --> 00:58:40,818
Depending on your point
of view, i guess.

1295
00:58:40,851 --> 00:58:44,589
I certainly threw myself
at it with gusto.

1296
00:58:44,622 --> 00:58:46,023
There was no half-Measures
with me.

1297
00:58:46,056 --> 00:58:48,025
People never said,
"i wonder if he's a..."

1298
00:58:48,058 --> 00:58:49,459
"No, no. He is."

1299
00:58:49,493 --> 00:58:51,829
So i mean, i've been sober
for a very long time

1300
00:58:51,862 --> 00:58:53,163
And people still say to me,
they say,

1301
00:58:53,197 --> 00:58:55,365
"Oh, craig, how much did you
drink back then?"

1302
00:58:55,399 --> 00:58:56,466
I'm like,
"i don't know."

1303
00:58:56,500 --> 00:59:00,037
It's not fucking
weight watchers.

1304
00:59:00,070 --> 00:59:02,072
It's not like you wake up
in the dumpster

1305
00:59:02,106 --> 00:59:03,440
And go, "oomp, 14 units.

1306
00:59:03,473 --> 00:59:06,243
I need a meeting."

1307
00:59:06,276 --> 00:59:08,445
That's one of the few upsides

1308
00:59:08,478 --> 00:59:09,747
Of active alcoholism.

1309
00:59:09,780 --> 00:59:12,817
Very little
in the way of paperwork.

1310
00:59:12,850 --> 00:59:16,086
It's one of those weird things,
being an alcoholic.

1311
00:59:16,120 --> 00:59:17,254
Everybody thinks
they know about it

1312
00:59:17,287 --> 00:59:18,388
More than you do.

1313
00:59:18,422 --> 00:59:19,924
It's kind of like having
a southern accent,

1314
00:59:19,957 --> 00:59:20,925
You know what i mean?

1315
00:59:20,958 --> 00:59:22,159
It's like people
do it back to you.

1316
00:59:22,192 --> 00:59:23,994
Like, "yickety-Dickety."

1317
00:59:24,028 --> 00:59:25,763
It's true. People think
they know about it.

1318
00:59:25,796 --> 00:59:26,831
They're like,
"oh, you know,

1319
00:59:26,864 --> 00:59:27,865
This is what you have to do."

1320
00:59:27,898 --> 00:59:29,066
I was like,
"oh, shut the fuck up."

1321
00:59:29,099 --> 00:59:30,234
You don't know
about this.

1322
00:59:30,267 --> 00:59:31,368
It's like...
people like me,

1323
00:59:31,401 --> 00:59:33,037
When we listen to people
who are not alcoholics,

1324
00:59:33,070 --> 00:59:34,238
And they're having drinks
and they say,

1325
00:59:34,271 --> 00:59:36,240
"Mm, oh, i'm gonna
have to stop now.

1326
00:59:36,273 --> 00:59:37,675
I'm starting to feel it."

1327
00:59:37,708 --> 00:59:41,245
And i'm like,
"that's the fucking point."

1328
00:59:43,213 --> 00:59:47,317
That's the point!

1329
00:59:47,351 --> 00:59:50,454
"Oh, i'm...i'm starting to get
a little drunk."

1330
00:59:50,487 --> 00:59:52,823
Yes!

1331
00:59:52,857 --> 00:59:56,627
Starting to feel it is not
the end of drinking.

1332
00:59:56,661 --> 00:59:59,329
It's the beginning
of drinking.

1333
01:00:04,234 --> 01:00:06,070
Anyway, look,
i'm gonna tell you this joke.

1334
01:00:06,103 --> 01:00:07,404
It's very important
that i tell you,

1335
01:00:07,437 --> 01:00:08,773
'Cause this
is what i want to do.

1336
01:00:08,806 --> 01:00:10,307
I want to tell you this joke,
and we're done.

1337
01:00:10,340 --> 01:00:11,575
I love this joke.

1338
01:00:11,608 --> 01:00:13,577
This is the best joke
i ever heard.

1339
01:00:13,610 --> 01:00:16,647
It's the most beautiful joke
in the world.

1340
01:00:16,681 --> 01:00:18,615
No pressure.

1341
01:00:18,649 --> 01:00:20,651
It's just a great joke.
I love this joke.

1342
01:00:20,685 --> 01:00:23,620
It's a joke which i think says
everything about men and women

1343
01:00:23,654 --> 01:00:25,122
And about life
and the universe

1344
01:00:25,155 --> 01:00:26,590
And how we must
all come together

1345
01:00:26,623 --> 01:00:28,625
And try and love each other
a little bit.

1346
01:00:28,659 --> 01:00:32,129
It was a joke made famous
in britain in the 1970s

1347
01:00:32,162 --> 01:00:34,498
By a british comedian
called bernard manning,

1348
01:00:34,531 --> 01:00:35,599
Who was a lovely man.

1349
01:00:35,632 --> 01:00:37,501
Well, he was
a fat, profane alcoholic,

1350
01:00:37,534 --> 01:00:39,937
But i liked him.

1351
01:00:39,970 --> 01:00:41,772
And he used to tell this joke,
and here it is.

1352
01:00:41,806 --> 01:00:42,940
He used to say...

1353
01:00:42,973 --> 01:00:44,574
"Ladies and gentlemen...

1354
01:00:44,608 --> 01:00:46,744
"I've got my wife
her christmas present.

1355
01:00:46,777 --> 01:00:50,247
"For christmas, i got her a pair
of shoes and a vibrator.

1356
01:00:50,280 --> 01:00:53,483
If she doesn't like the shoes,
she can go fuck herself."

1357
01:01:01,759 --> 01:01:04,194
Sorry, i love that joke.

1358
01:01:06,030 --> 01:01:08,298
And that's it. That's the joke
i came to tell you.

1359
01:01:08,332 --> 01:01:10,067
And we're done now.
That's it. It's over.

1360
01:01:10,100 --> 01:01:11,869
The joke has been told.

1361
01:01:14,571 --> 01:01:17,307
Thank you.

1362
01:01:17,341 --> 01:01:19,509
No, i'm done.

1363
01:01:19,543 --> 01:01:21,545
The only thing
that remains for me to do

1364
01:01:21,578 --> 01:01:24,148
Is to thank you
for your southern hospitality,

1365
01:01:24,181 --> 01:01:27,217
Your weirdly creepy
friendliness, and your, uh...

1366
01:01:29,619 --> 01:01:32,757
And your adorable accents.

1367
01:01:32,790 --> 01:01:36,193
Yuguda-Diggada-Doo-Doo.

1368
01:01:36,226 --> 01:01:38,428
I'd like to thank you
the only way i really know how...

1369
01:01:38,462 --> 01:01:40,831
In the form of a song.

1370
01:01:44,301 --> 01:01:48,739
It's a song that goes
a little something like this.

1371
01:01:53,410 --> 01:02:00,818
*

1372
01:02:00,851 --> 01:02:04,054

* oh, baby

1378
01:02:18,903 --> 01:02:22,339
* it might seem like a crush

1379
01:02:22,372 --> 01:02:25,009
* but it doesn't mean

1380
01:02:25,042 --> 01:02:28,745
* that i'm serious

1381
01:02:28,779 --> 01:02:33,217
* 'cause to lose
all my senses *

1382
01:02:33,250 --> 01:02:37,187
* that is just
so typically me *

1383
01:02:37,221 --> 01:02:38,923
* oh, baby, baby

1384
01:02:38,956 --> 01:02:42,292
* oops!
I did it again *

1385
01:02:42,326 --> 01:02:45,529
* i played with your heart

1386
01:02:45,562 --> 01:02:47,531
* got lost in the game

1387
01:02:47,564 --> 01:02:49,033
* oh, baby, baby

1388
01:02:49,066 --> 01:02:52,536
* oops!
You think i'm in love *

1389
01:02:52,569 --> 01:02:56,173
* that i'm sent from above

1390
01:02:56,206 --> 01:02:59,509
* i'm not that innocent

1391
01:02:59,543 --> 01:03:02,612
* you see my problem is this

1392
01:03:02,646 --> 01:03:05,382
* i'm dreaming away

1393
01:03:05,415 --> 01:03:09,586
* wishing that heroes,
they truly exist *

1394
01:03:09,619 --> 01:03:12,957
* i cry watching the days

1395
01:03:12,990 --> 01:03:15,459
* can't you see i'm a fool

1396
01:03:15,492 --> 01:03:18,762
* in so many ways?

1397
01:03:18,795 --> 01:03:23,934
* but to lose all my senses

1398
01:03:23,968 --> 01:03:27,637
* that is just
so typically me *

1399
01:03:27,671 --> 01:03:29,606
* baby, oh

1400
01:03:29,639 --> 01:03:32,977
