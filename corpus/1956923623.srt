1
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,289
This is the last time I do that vulgar
contradict allegations.

2
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:59,800
I have no sexual relations
had with that young man, Mr. Lapinsky.

3
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:03,910
He was an intern
with whom I have had brief contact.

4
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:16,806
That was it. Did you come?

5
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:23,964
But this time almost.
Next time.

6
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:27,840
After an average of 1 minute 35
we are always ready.

7
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:32,207
You must always run away immediately
after we...

8
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:37,406
You know that Kellyx likes you, right?
-How about love?

9
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:40,490
I get the L word
hard on my lips.

10
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:43,570
Kellyx wish you ...
- Other was.

11
00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:49.643
Maybe you should next time
wear a uniform.

12
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:54,926
Then you look like a new man.
I love uniforms.

13
00:01:55,120 --> 00:02:01,924
Assistants, concierges,
the cleaner who cleans your pipes.

14
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:04,566
Kellyx loves strong men
in uniform.

15
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:07,570
The idea of ​​the knots
making is so ...

16
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:15,249
Twice.

17
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:22,447
I don't know what to do. With that
They come to Viagra for women so quickly.

18
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:27,282
I really sympathize with you. It's me
also sat to be a sex object.

19
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,604
What is that?

20
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:36,885
It depends on the uniform. I remember
not even her name anymore.

21
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:38,849
We have talked about this.

22
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:44,968
If you want me to be someone else,
Then why are you with me?

23
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:46,969
You're right.

24
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,925
In what then?
-You can't change.

25
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:54.903
I'm leaving you.

26
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:09,850
You meet your dream girl ...

27
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:14,602
on the day you find out you're a scary
got illness from another.

28
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:17,690
You have one hour left to live.
What are you saying to her?

29
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:21,487
Against who?
-To the girl of your dreams.

30
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:25,844
Is this such a hypothetical question
or a real question?

31
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:30,728
The perfect girl lives in another
country. They shoot at you at the border.

32
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:36,370
The relationship issue. Get rid of it. Do you know
What does a relationship do with your overtime?

33
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:39,609
It's about sex, not relationships.

34
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:51,691
If I ... No, if I ...

35
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:56,767
raise the nylon by 2.5 percent ...

36
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:58,883
then the net weight would be ...

37
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:05,247
decrease by 2.5 ... by 0.4 percent.

38
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:22,408
I'm getting promotion today.

39
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:31,570
Nylon car engines.

40
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:39,451
They drive really, but the best of them
is that they are not real.

41
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:43,420
What about the trend against plastics?

42
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:45,846
Do you have the new silver
seen devices?

43
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:51,285
I bought a silver telephone.
It is a bit heavy, but very beautiful.

44
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:58.63
Let us have the graphs
let's see, Joe.

45
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:03,880
Guy.
-The charts.

46
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:11,370
Our research shows that there is a slight one
decrease in the sale of plastic is ...

47
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:17,440
but i think that
in the future ...

48
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:22,724
Well it will ... it will get better.

49
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:27,430
We improve sales
with a global campaign.

50
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:29,846
Plastic can continue to exist.

51
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:35,410
I don't like such a plastic motor.

52
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:41,369
People can go through their computer
to travel. I want something with more 'oemf'.

53
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:50,447
I would recommend a new product
able to design.

54
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:56,646
At work, people.

55
00:05:56,840 --> 00:06:02,244
I want what women want. They are
our primary consumer group.

56
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:08,100
A woman must
lead this campaign.

57
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:14,162
You're ready for promotion, don't you, Kellyx?
I would really like that.

58
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:17,842
I want Guy on my team
as my assistant.

59
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:23,570
Okay then. But I give
him no promotion.

60
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:27,810
I already have this year
given a man promotion.

61
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:32,164
Those stimulating condoms were
in the mail.

62
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:43,370
He is a perfect masseur, he shrugs
her was up. He is a slave.

63
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:46,962
He's a rat.
-He is an art person.

64
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:51,886
I never guessed. I know
the guy who does his parts.

65
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:56,768
They make women look so good
look? Not that I need one.

66
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:05,929
Hello, Rocky.
-Hiroki.

67
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:08,900
Also fine.

68
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:12,364
Greta is not like Kellyx. She is too old
to get flesh and blood.

69
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:15,291
Do you know whoever?
has an art person? Perez.

70
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:18,689
What are you doing here?
- Please love me.

71
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:22,885
You know you can't go downstairs
come. Do you want them to fire me?

72
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:27,529
Stop it.
- Please love me.

73
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:31,327
It is unfair that men
they may not have.

74
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:35,844
Would be with a male president
we will be satisfied.

75
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:39,522
If the boss sees this,
he can shake it.

76
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:41,370
Hopefully she doesn't see it.

77
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:45,531
Are you defective? What is your serial number?

78
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:11,560
Refers to non-programmed
emotions fuse through?

79
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:15,765
Please don't leave me
have to work for a steel company.

80
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:19,646
That's not fair.
You also have a toy.

81
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:24,562
Life is not always
honest for a man, Joe.

82
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:31,325
Do you and your robot want to get lost now?

83
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:47,407
Do you know what to do, Guy?
Purchase such a plastic woman.

84
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,523
An art person?

85
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:53,923
They make them nowadays
very real.

86
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:58,569
They never tell you to shave,
and otherwise turn them off.

87
00:08:58.60 --> 00:09:00.808
And then end up as Perez.

88
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,288
The loser. Such a toy
can you still hide?

89
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:08,405
Why don't you take one?
-My credit cards work against it.

90
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:10,170
Plastic.

91
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:18,489
Here's a ticket. Call this woman.
Her name is Boyla and she is a robot expert.

92
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:21,524
I'm really not starting it.

93
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:24,321
Can I have a wife here?

94
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:28,650
Yes of course. We have a
public holiday special with redheads.

95
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:34,244
The eyes are not included. Would you
give me that hand?

96
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:41,368
I've never done this before.
- Many virgins come here.

97
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,686
May I?

98
00:09:58.80 --> 00:10:00.166
How expensive?

99
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:06,561
Some take out a mortgage,
but this yields more than a house.

100
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:08,410
A house?

101
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:16,489
I absolutely cannot afford that.
-I also have a lesser model.

102
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:18,489
Does it only have one arm or something?

103
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:24,130
There are a few small ones
downsides. Little.

104
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:29,121
Thanks for your time, but I think
that I'm going to find a normal girl ...

105
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:31,490
in a normal way.

106
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:45,363
You noticed me. I want you
like to get to know better.

107
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:55,600
You and I, we are going ...

108
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:58,727
Hey. My father raised me ...
-Boats.

109
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:04,600
Hey. I want a romantic,
monogamous relationship.

110
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:11,688
Excuse me.
Do you know what time it is?

111
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:18,965
That would...

112
00:11:20.720 --> 00:11:25.965
All right. Not here. I want you
like to get to know first.

113
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:30,690
That is not...

114
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:34,602
Put them in the water.

115
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:57,100
Fork.

116
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:04,329
Eating more oyster bars, and not
so many vitamins for your brain.

117
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:06,807
You think too much anyway.

118
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:10,286
All right. I will think less.

119
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:14,604
Should women leave you,
like you-know-who?

120
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:17,849
Mom didn't leave me, but you.

121
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:20,930
I meant that shikse
who you loved in Paris.

122
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:26,331
He did not leave, but died.
-Does not matter. You are different.

123
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:33,290
All my friends have
at least one grandchild.

124
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:07,801
What should I call you then?

125
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:12,900
I don't have a name. We have
no names needed here.

126
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:17,525
Then I will have a name
have to invent for you.

127
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:21,725
A name. Jesus Christ.

128
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:26,965
I've been all my life
addressed with millions of names.

129
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:31,641
I'm better off
with a grunt or moan as a name.

130
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:40,244
I believe I love you.

131
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:44,844
I had already been once. Do you have
still that model that nobody wanted?

132
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:50,444
That cheaper one. Like a chestnut
brown costs less than a ...

133
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:54,330
Really?

134
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:59,128
Yeah that would be great. I am coming...
Hey?

135
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:06,610
Finally someone to talk to.
-With those tubes?

136
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:10,850
Someone to cuddle at night.
- And she's nice and flexible.

137
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:18,242
If she nags that she wants some space,
you can turn it off and put it away.

138
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:22,126
Stop it
staring at that photo.

139
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:24,721
She was really unique.

140
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:29,481
You are a smart guy. You can
do not bring the dead to life.

141
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:34,930
Bet?

142
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:50,207
She must love basketball.
She must love my favorite beer.

143
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:53,131
She needs my armbands
to hold.

144
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:59.602
And sex. Lots of sex.
Twice a day. With an orgasm.

145
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:03,122
The sex express. No stops.

146
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:09,889
Even more preferences? Color of it
pubic hair, length of the tongue ...

147
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:13,482
Smell of the skin? We have berries.

148
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:18,527
I do not want that. Surprise me.

149
00:16:18.720 --> 00:16:21.410
Unspecified skin odor.

150
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:24,850
That.

151
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:31,924
And that.

152
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:39,363
She has a touch pad on her hips
if you want to reprogram her.

153
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:45,249
A couple more questions.
Intellect or no sense?

154
00:16:45.440 --> 00:16:47.169
Please understand.

155
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:52,651
What type? Hellenic? Semitic?
Eastern provincial?

156
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:56,162
Romanian?
-Einstein meets Groucho Marx.

157
00:16:56.360 --> 00:16:57.885
Look at that.

158
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:01,489
Smaller.

159
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:05,964
We will take care of it
that everything is absolutely right.

160
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:11,485
You can keep her for seven days.
We will recycle her next week.

161
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:14,100
Can I not keep her?

162
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:19,411
We needed a low cost plan
think up because you had some problems.

163
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:24,811
This is also a test model. She's half
from cloned DNA and half from plastic.

164
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,686
Hooves. If only she is
50% artificial?

165
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:34,808
It is also 50% human, and that is
half more women than you have now.

166
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:42,730
How do you like it?
-Beautiful.

167
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:47,608
I want to impress her.
-She's a robot.

168
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:52,806
Your mantra:Don't be too eager ...
-Do not be an instrument ...

169
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,162
And give her what you have.

170
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:59,649
What do you think about it?
-Do you have a shoehorn?

171
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:18,249
I will next time
get some more candy for you.

172
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:24,769
You are apparently a sweet tooth.

173
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:31,921
Maybe you try your inner chill
to compensate.

174
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:46.522
I am ... You already know who I am.

175
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:52,889
What is your zodiac sign?
You don't have one.

176
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:08,689
Package for you.

177
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:59,891
Exactly as stated in the brochure.

178
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,968
I'm Guy.

179
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:21,210
This is your new house.

180
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:24,364
Do you like it?

181
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:28,169
Did I order you?

182
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:45,121
I froze.
-Really?

183
00:20:45.320 --> 00:20:50.804
I wanted to impress you.
- That's what all the guys want.

184
00:20:54.880 --> 00:20:56.609
All men?

185
00:20:58.280 --> 00:21:01.568
Wait a second. Are you not new?

186
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:04,525
Your money was not enough
for a new model.

187
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:07,121
I have a cybrarian
out of 83 seated ...

188
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:12,167
and with a young sumo wrestler
with a very large ... Do you mind?

189
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:14,124
Not at all.

190
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:20,166
You didn't want a jealous partner.
That is in your file.

191
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:24,524
I get it.

192
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:29,900
You don't want a jealous partner,
but you can be jealous.

193
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:37,403
Just kidding. You have a sarcastic feeling
ordered for humor, remember?

194
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:40,605
I am new.

195
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:45,522
So I have no memory for you
comparable with previous customers.

196
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:48,410
This is also the first time for me.

197
00:21:57,680 --> 00:22:00,206
Has anyone ever
sucked on your toe?

198
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:05,900
Shall we take it easy?

199
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:11,401
If we have sex tonight,
you will never respect me.

200
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:18,245
Besides, I don't even know your name.
- But I don't have a name.

201
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:25,860
Do you want one?
-Do you want me to want one?

202
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:29,489
Teach me how to feel like a real one
woman must behave ...

203
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:32,411
so that the company police don't catch us.

204
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:35,683
I want to be just like the rest.

205
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:40,602
Nobody wants to be just like the rest.

206
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:43,690
Why is it so bad?
to be mediocre?

207
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:54,528
You really have a species
human complex.

208
00:22:54.720 --> 00:22:56.210
Indeed.

209
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:00,240
I ordered smaller ones.

210
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:13,365
Okay, this is my camera.
He records and plays.

211
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:16,848
But don't connect me to the television.

212
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:20,327
Do I have to feed you, boss?

213
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:25,560
'Boss? I have never been
previously called boss.

214
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:28,206
I'm going for a pastrami omelet
make it for you.

215
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:34,407
A real? My favorite dish.
- mine too.

216
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:40,568
Plump down nicely
and watch the game later.

217
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:46.67
It starts in 7.2 minutes.
The bet against our team is 10 to 5.

218
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:52,840
Do we have...

219
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:14,641
It was my birthday yesterday.
-Days are just numbers.

220
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:17,684
Make a wish.

221
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:49,207
This biodegradable
diapers are actually ...

222
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:52,763
recyclable.

223
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:59,810
Has Kellyx approved it?
And what do you have?

224
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:06,405
Bravo, exactly where my consumers
are looking for.

225
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:13.927
You better invent something
what people actually buy ...

226
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:17,488
otherwise you need steel
go learn, Joe.

227
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:23,510
Guy. My name is G ... Why are you staying?
call me Joe?

228
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:26,164
All men look like Joe.
That's easier.

229
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:32,490
That way I remember everyone's name.
Joe, right?

230
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:41,762
Your cheeks are redder
when you talk about yourself.

231
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:47,329
Why do you like it so much
to talk? Most are not like that.

232
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:55,700
Because I was because of my father
brought up, who is an ICQ therapist.

233
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:58,522
He earns money with the
online treatment of people.

234
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:02,483
I have more therapy as a child
then got Woody Allen.

235
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:04,125
Who is that?

236
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:08,530
A guy who is with his daughter
went to bed.

237
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:12,400
He has also made a number of films.

238
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:23,965
Hello, son.

239
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:36,728
Dad, this is sick.

240
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:42,170
Were you taking a bath? Shall I call later?
Call me back, yes.

241
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:46,763
I'm not gone long. I still have to
make contact with a baby shower.

242
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:50,442
Melissus' son has
have a son ...

243
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:55,965
although it is slightly smaller
then Towy's grandchild.

244
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:59,500
Not that you care.

245
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:08,890
Are you taking a bath with someone?

246
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:12,890
Something like that.

247
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:20,525
Why didn't you say that? Together in the bath
is good for you know. Is it Kellyx?

248
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:27,721
It is someone who can wait.

249
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:36,120
He wants a family as soon as possible
founding, although he doesn't know that yet.

250
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:38,926
Dad, stop it.

251
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:41,851
I really want to see you.
Is it Friday night?

252
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:43,849
I have to hang up.

253
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:47,842
I keep my mouth shut.

254
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:56,245
But you need the horizontal tango
play when I've hung up.

255
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:58,329
Yet?

256
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:13,647
My father wouldn't be really happy like him
I heard something about a robot.

257
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:17,208
He wants me to have children,
no blenders.

258
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:33,288
Terrible, those politicians who say that
they are going to do something about the ozone layer.

259
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:37,690
It rains a lot in Paris.
Do I have a big ass in these pants?

260
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:39,564
Compared to what?

261
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:45,931
I know your personality
consists of data.

262
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:51,365
But you have to tell me about yourself.
- Are you really interested in me?

263
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:53,642
You should see it here.

264
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:06,122
I work here. Now you have to go home.

265
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:11,445
I have to hold that promotion
to drag. Although it makes no sense.

266
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:15,725
Because nobody believes in me.
-I do.

267
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:32,768
Hello, Guy. Imagine me
not ahead of your girl?

268
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:34,769
I'm not a girl.

269
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:39,886
Are you real?
How do you get such a good one?

270
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:44,290
She likes me for my brain.
You should try it too.

271
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:50,283
Rooster. I was like that too, so I left him
take off. I have a nicer ass.

272
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:52,164
Are you sure?

273
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:58,725
Down?

274
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:06,367
Maybe I will get a promotion
if I'm going to wear a uniform.

275
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:10,770
Do not. The imperfections
make you who you are.

276
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:15,522
Let your guts guide you.

277
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:28,847
She is perfect.

278
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:36,324
I could also create something like that.

279
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:44,611
At least part of her.

280
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:08,289
Where do women desire
the most nasty?

281
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:11,802
Think about sex, think of cars.

282
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:17,882
I think the product for which we
advertising should be practical.

283
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:24,531
Just give us the results of the
opinion poll among women, Joe.

284
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:28,520
I am also a consumer.
-I'm listening.

285
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:32,366
Plastic human body parts.

286
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:41,485
Synthetic body parts, with
extensive movement options.

287
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:45,765
A rock climber would further his legs
extend beyond normal.

288
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:50,247
It has two joints,
what makes you stronger.

289
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:54,650
Everyone can be a virtuoso pianist.

290
00:31:54.40 --> 00:32:00.370
We can now even more of us
body and perform better.

291
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:06,169
Consider all the options.
-You can scratch your own back.

292
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:09,322
New sex positions.

293
00:32:09.520 --> 00:32:14.820
You can turn your head 180 degrees
and look behind you.

294
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:17,762
A man can meet his own ...
sucking toe.

295
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:27,406
Not bad, Guy.
-Indeed. He's mine.

296
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:48,326
I'd like to talk first.

297
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:52,850
Talk.

298
00:33:12.720 --> 00:33:15.883
You are so cute
if you worry.

299
00:33:18.720 --> 00:33:21.291
I can't believe you're mine.

300
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:25,764
Put me to the test.

301
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:30,801
I do everything you say.

302
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:14,889
That was heavenly.

303
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:19,445
You're the biggest I've had.

304
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:25,888
I thought I was the only one.

305
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:30,565
You are the only and the largest.

306
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:39,121
Do you want another orgasm?

307
00:34:40,160 --> 00:34:41,730
Is that allowed?

308
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:17,120
Did your art person do that?
Yummy.

309
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:23,121
It was crazy, man. She did
everything exactly as I wanted it.

310
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:27,847
It's kind of weird. It is
like I was doing it to myself.

311
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:30,566
And the lips?
-I haven't kissed her yet.

312
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:32,683
I didn't mean that, but okay.

313
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:38,284
You did it with a machine.
Fantastic.

314
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:44,764
Don't call her a robot.

315
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:48,608
That's just what she is.

316
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:52,930
I don't want her upset.
She has a Pinocchio complex.

317
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:56,329
Wood, metal, plastic, what does it matter.
She doesn't feel anything.

318
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:58.88
Maybe ever.

319
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:01,691
Is that a possibility or a wish?

320
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:05,248
No idea. I have never
what about a robot.

321
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:08,370
Accept the pain.

322
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:14,767
Who am I kidding?

323
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:19,610
I am not perfect.

324
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:29,601
Fortunately there is still chocolate.

325
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:45,687
Do you want me to be perfect?

326
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:57,450
I wish I were that. For you.

327
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:11,604
What a beautiful specimen.
Hello Mary, I am ...

328
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:17,170
I know who you are. We have enough
memory space for 200 friends.

329
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:18,850
Yes.

330
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:24,206
You drink iced coffee with aspirin,
amphetamines and antihistamines.

331
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:31,889
Tell her not to do that again.
-She's mine.

332
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:35,880
I have seen the receipt.
You don't have to be so selfish.

333
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:41,564
I recently borrowed you my stereo.
Can't what's my name?

334
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:45,480
That is not healthy.
- I'll take a shower.

335
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:47,925
Friends of mine can me
better not share ...

336
00:37:48.120 --> 00:37:51.920
because their companionship is essential
for optimum performance.

337
00:37:52,120 --> 00:37:56,967
I would like this glorious friendship
not want to destroy.

338
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:14,291
What about that promotion?

339
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:19,520
I don't want to disappoint you, but ...
How should I state this.

340
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:25,363
You have too much testosterone
to be creative.

341
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:29,884
It is an anti-Freudian theory.

342
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:37,890
If you don't have a penis,
you also have no fear of castration.

343
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:42,460
We can take greater risks.

344
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:47,610
I thought I had now proven that
as creative as a woman can be.

345
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:54,331
Oh, honey. It's not you guys
have no good things.

346
00:38:54,520 --> 00:39:01,290
I have for example
purchased this implant ...

347
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:05,246
so that I can pee standing.

348
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:08,681
Very practical.

349
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,287
Sorry.

350
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:18,444
Good aim is not easy.

351
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:29,811
You see? You shouldn't be right
if women are, but better.

352
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:37,328
Do you also have a tango program?
-I do not know.

353
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:39,807
Sorry.

354
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:45,609
I meant tonight
want to dance with you.

355
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:51,110
Out in the computer?
-No, really. And upright.

356
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:24,128
I love you, Mary.

357
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:33,928
The correct answer is:me from you too.

358
00:41:36,520 --> 00:41:38,363
Sorry.

359
00:41:40,520 --> 00:41:42,602
I do not know how.

360
00:41:45.720 --> 00:41:47.927
But maybe I can learn.

361
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:10,767
Of course she can't.
-I was just curious.

362
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:13,848
She can't love you.

363
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:22,848
What toaster do you have?
Do you have such a beautiful one that fits in everything?

364
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:24,849
Does your toaster love you?

365
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:29,246
Never?
Nobody ever asked for it.

366
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:33,810
That's what it was all about.
No tears, no crap.

367
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:36,204
I thought it would be ideal for you ...

368
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:38,846
but you are clearly different.

369
00:42:39,880 --> 00:42:42,531
Isn't she 50 percent human?

370
00:42:46.240 --> 00:42:48.830
I teach her.

371
00:42:48,280 --> 00:42:53,571
Do what you want, but ask her
do not expose to the sun for too long.

372
00:42:54.60 --> 00:42:58.62
Food leads to a chemical
reaction in the body ...

373
00:42:58.60 --> 00:43:01.910
very similar to emotions.

374
00:43:04,760 --> 00:43:10,847
People combine meat with lettuce
to be balanced.

375
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:13,646
Just hit one
through my fuses?

376
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:20,129
Look at this.

377
00:43:21,400 --> 00:43:22,610
Chocolate.

378
00:43:25,320 --> 00:43:27,800
Chocolate kills you.

379
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:34,565
Chocolate is just like love.

380
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:38,800
You have to puke ...

381
00:43:39,800 --> 00:43:43,529
and at the same time ... you want more.

382
00:43:45,680 --> 00:43:49,765
That was a bad example.
It is like holding each other's hands.

383
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,924
Bend your fingers.

384
00:43:53,880 --> 00:43:58,568
Why?
-Because it's fun.

385
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:06,286
I will take you to the park and
show what people in love do?

386
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:10,929
Really? What should I wear?
-Whatever you want.

387
00:44:11,120 --> 00:44:15,444
I only know what you like.
Then wear what I want.

388
00:44:15,640 --> 00:44:18,410
Preference not specified.

389
00:44:19,600 --> 00:44:22,604
Can we...
-Yeah, we're going to buy candy.

390
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:45,844
I felt something. A warm wave.

391
00:44:47,240 --> 00:44:50,289
But I don't think you are
that can call love.

392
00:44:58,280 --> 00:45:00,890
I'm hungry.

393
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:02,964
Me too.

394
00:45:10.920 --> 00:45:12.809
I want a pizza.

395
00:45:14,600 --> 00:45:16,409
Me too.

396
00:45:20,360 --> 00:45:22,328
Are you really hungry?

397
00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:25,488
I'm hungry if you have that.

398
00:45:38,360 --> 00:45:44,830
I know exactly what you are going to do.

399
00:45:47,120 --> 00:45:52,524
I can also be unpredictable
if you program what you want.

400
00:45:53,680 --> 00:45:57,480
What I want is starting to bore me.

401
00:46:01,560 --> 00:46:03,449
Pastrami omelette?

402
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:09,522
It is your favorite dish.
-I do not want that.

403
00:46:12,200 --> 00:46:15,440
People grow, people change.

404
00:46:16,280 --> 00:46:18,806
They even outgrow
their favorite omelette.

405
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:21,970
Tell me what you want,
then you get that.

406
00:46:30,200 --> 00:46:33,443
Would it help if I had more
if that woman was in Paris?

407
00:46:35,360 --> 00:46:37,761
That would be me if you wanted it.

408
00:46:42,600 --> 00:46:44,807
I want you...

409
00:46:46,840 --> 00:46:48,729
but different.

410
00:46:52,320 --> 00:46:55,510
This is what you ordered.

411
00:46:55,240 --> 00:47:02,100
If someone says, "I want you different
', you should get angry.

412
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:09,562
What if I reprogram you?
If I reprint you ...

413
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:12,809
You wanted someone you wouldn't
try to change.

414
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:15,446
Why are you trying me
then change?

415
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:11,608
I've seen Guy's new girlfriend.
Just like a model. A perfect body.

416
00:48:11,800 --> 00:48:16,522
Perfect body?
Not that yours isn't beautiful.

417
00:48:18,320 --> 00:48:21,290
Have you ever wondered ...

418
00:48:21,480 --> 00:48:25,963
If we women are so beautiful
and be successful and powerful ...

419
00:48:26,200 --> 00:48:28,601
why are we alone?

420
00:48:39,520 --> 00:48:42,460
Let's now
realize that network campaign.

421
00:48:42,240 --> 00:48:46.245
Tonight is not so ... Is that a ...
Look at the time.

422
00:48:46.440 --> 00:48:51.571
Do you want to keep your job? Miss wants
probably not a benefit recipient.

423
00:48:51,760 --> 00:48:55,162
Can she ... I mean, come in?

424
00:48:57,800 --> 00:48:59,162
You keep surprising me.

425
00:49:16,600 --> 00:49:22,801
Don't offer your Kellyx something to drink
or does she have to go get it herself?

426
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:26,641
I'll make it.
I already have it.

427
00:49:31,720 --> 00:49:34,291
Your favorite drink.

428
00:49:34,480 --> 00:49:37,510
What kind of diet do you follow?
-None.

429
00:49:37,240 --> 00:49:40,500
Fortunate metabolism?
-Something, yes.

430
00:49:45,680 --> 00:49:52,643
I'm Kellyx, Guys ex.
-I'm Mary, Guys current.

431
00:49:53,680 --> 00:49:55,648
So you're from ...

432
00:49:57,800 --> 00:50:02,564
Because you have a slight accent.
-Guy likes accents.

433
00:50:02,760 --> 00:50:09,410
She also imitates people. She can
Warren Beatty very well.

434
00:50:09.240 --> 00:50:12.722
The actor?
-No, the president.

435
00:50:14.720 --> 00:50:20.124
I didn't know he liked accents.
What else does Guy like?

436
00:50:20,320 --> 00:50:24,600
It is very easy.
He wants you to listen to him ...

437
00:50:24,200 --> 00:50:29,764
and toes suck, and kinky sex,
and orgasm twice a day.

438
00:50:29,960 --> 00:50:35,649
Have you been a geisha?
-No, but I know geisha tricks.

439
00:50:42,880 --> 00:50:45,247
She..-
You...

440
00:50:45.440 --> 00:50:51.766
You are really glowing with it. What kind
guy buys a robot at all?

441
00:50:51,960 --> 00:50:56,900
A guy who's too tall with robotic
women like you.

442
00:50:56,280 --> 00:50:59,568
R2D2 agree with you here.

443
00:50:59,760 --> 00:51:03,287
It took me 7200 seconds
to make him forget you.

444
00:51:04,320 --> 00:51:08,410
That you have taken refuge
to buy a girl.

445
00:51:09,240 --> 00:51:11,971
What does that say about me?

446
00:51:13,400 --> 00:51:17,450
I thought I could make you happy.

447
00:51:17,240 --> 00:51:21,802
I don't have the feeling with her
that I have to be someone else.

448
00:51:28,560 --> 00:51:32,167
Slapjanus.

449
00:52:21,760 --> 00:52:24,570
Stop it, Guy.
-I want to explain.

450
00:52:24,760 --> 00:52:31,600
Do you want to go for a steel company?
to work? Plastic flows through your veins.

451
00:52:31,200 --> 00:52:37,128
People are fired every day.
- And I like to fire Joe's.

452
00:52:48,560 --> 00:52:53,885
Alright then, but then
you don't know my plan yet.

453
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:57,241
A plan?
-A man?

454
00:52:58.720 --> 00:53:03.890
Use the art people
to show the plastic body parts ...

455
00:53:03,280 --> 00:53:05,601
in our advertisement.

456
00:53:05,800 --> 00:53:10,886
You show what the limbs can do
without having to operate on people.

457
00:53:11,800 --> 00:53:16,410
This is how you save on insurance
and on money.

458
00:53:17,400 --> 00:53:21,602
Research shows that there is a secret
desire for art people exists.

459
00:53:21,800 --> 00:53:25,964
Who doesn't want a perfect one
android to bed?

460
00:53:29,880 --> 00:53:34,522
We are going to show people
that with plastic body parts ...

461
00:53:34,720 --> 00:53:39,282
they can do anything
what an art person can do.

462
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:46,489
But I am in charge of ...
-Sorry, you'll have to assist Guy.

463
00:53:46.680 --> 00:53:52.403
You know, a man at the head
is not as bad as it seems.

464
00:53:53,200 --> 00:53:59.651
TANG SOO Enterprises' new
strategy:A MAN AT THE HEAD

465
00:54:04,360 --> 00:54:06,931
Would you like me without a uniform?

466
00:54:10.880 --> 00:54:15.488
Who knows. Why would you do it
pull it out at all?

467
00:54:24,520 --> 00:54:27,205
I've been thinking about it for a long time.

468
00:54:27,400 --> 00:54:32,281
They say your life partner
but better be your best friend.

469
00:54:33,240 --> 00:54:34,890
Marry me.

470
00:54:38,800 --> 00:54:43,410
I could really learn to love you.
I'm not jealous of your machine.

471
00:54:43,240 --> 00:54:46,449
We can even
maintain a triangular relationship.

472
00:54:51,120 --> 00:54:52,884
I understand.

473
00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:04,123
No thanks?
I'm talking about nepotism.

474
00:55:04,320 --> 00:55:08,600
You make a career, it is going well
with Mary, I want to go further.

475
00:55:08,200 --> 00:55:12,285
Help me further.
-It's not possible.

476
00:55:15,440 --> 00:55:17,966
What a lazy answer.

477
00:55:18,160 --> 00:55:24,880
You know how much effort I had to make
for these advances? Look at this tie.

478
00:55:24,280 --> 00:55:26,931
Ever been in love
on a toaster?

479
00:55:27,120 --> 00:55:29,122
A toaster?
-Yes.

480
00:55:29,320 --> 00:55:32,961
I love you because I can
evenly brown?

481
00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:37,483
It doesn't matter what I feel.

482
00:55:38,600 --> 00:55:43,322
She's just like the tin man.
I have no heart.

483
00:57:10,360 --> 00:57:12,567
She will never love you.

484
00:57:17,720 --> 00:57:19,848
She will never love you.

485
00:57:29,240 --> 00:57:30,890
Why?

486
00:57:50,320 --> 00:57:54,928
Guy, take your doll
to the photo shoot. Can she dance?

487
00:58:09,360 --> 00:58:14,241
He has no trouble with it at all
to love me.

488
00:58:14,440 --> 00:58:18,650
He even likes it
a little too much from me.

489
00:58:20,360 --> 00:58:22,328
It is on my nerves.

490
00:58:23,640 --> 00:58:28,168
It looks like you have one
of those new models.

491
00:58:29,480 --> 00:58:34,566
I love you. Do you love me?

492
00:58:35,440 --> 00:58:37,900
You do not love me.

493
00:58:38,240 --> 00:58:40,242
But I love you.

494
00:59:01,760 --> 00:59:03,330
Do not worry.

495
00:59:04,760 --> 00:59:09,607
He always has a stop
if I don't say I love him too.

496
00:59:12,400 --> 00:59:16,602
He has no stubble.
Just baby buttocks. It is lucky.

497
00:59:16,800 --> 00:59:18,643
That's a novelty.

498
00:59:18.840 --> 00:59:23.846
Who wants such a rough chin
when your guy down there is busy.

499
00:59:24,400 --> 00:59:29,968
He also has no touchpad.
- Everything is built-in internally.

500
00:59:30,160 --> 00:59:32,891
That is for safety.

501
00:59:33,800 --> 00:59:39,167
Don't you think that's dangerous?
Someone can modify yours.

502
00:59:40,600 --> 00:59:43,524
You will have a cheap one
have a version.

503
00:59:45,160 --> 00:59:47,322
I have made a good deal.

504
01:00:04,800 --> 01:00:07,485
Art people die of love.

505
1:00:09,360 --> 1:00:12,762
What if I finally love him
and he dies?

506
1:00:16,800 --> 1:00:18,526
And what if he doesn't love me?

507
1:00:35,400 --> 1:00:37,687
Back, please.

508
1:00:38,960 --> 1:00:42,328
I have plans for this space.
I have to free up space.

509
01:00:42.520 --> 01:00:44.648
For nylons and acrylic fibers.

510
1:00:44,840 --> 1:00:52,800
So that's how they end up? They change
in telephones and cigarette holders?

511
1:00:52,200 --> 1:00:54,521
In other art people.

512
01:00:54.720 --> 01:00:59.169
Mary can be a dwarf or a bearded one
Become a Slavic soldier.

513
01:00:59,360 --> 01:01:05,163
Great that you have a boring face and a
sarcastic impact can say hello.

514
01:01:06,240 --> 01:01:11,870
I want her to get gray hair and wrinkles.

515
01:01:11,280 --> 01:01:14,443
If it is not recycled tomorrow,
she crashes.

516
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:55,128
I was thinking...

517
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:03,483
Maybe we should
remove your touchpad ...

518
01:02:03,680 --> 01:02:06,206
and give you your freedom.

519
01:02:06,400 --> 01:02:09,961
I don't know if being free
mechanically possible.

520
01:02:11,640 --> 01:02:13,449
What is that?

521
01:02:18.960 --> 01:02:21.645
What are you doing with me?

522
01:02:44,480 --> 01:02:47,860
If this is the last day
of your life was ...

523
01:02:48,560 --> 01:02:50,722
what would you like to do?

524
01:02:53,800 --> 01:02:55,484
I do not know.

525
01:02:56.320 --> 01:03:00.803
Let's go to Paris.
-The real Paris, where it rains?

526
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:06,723
No, the real Paris is full of thieves
and drunks and French.

527
01:03:22,280 --> 01:03:25,450
I have a much better idea.

528
01:04:15,520 --> 01:04:17,409
How did you get in?

529
01:04:19,800 --> 01:04:20.764
With Guys cardkey.

530
01:04:21,840 --> 01:04:28,883
He gave it to me.
He wants to make love to me tonight. Here.

531
01:04:29,960 --> 01:04:31,883
Men are so fickle.

532
01:04:32,800 --> 01:04:36,608
One day they want a violent one
nun, the next virgin whore.

533
01:04:37,880 --> 01:04:40,531
I can only handle one order at a time.

534
01:04:40,720 --> 01:04:46,807
Listen, honey, a relationship is nothing
then the meat exchange.

535
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:50,641
You choose whether you want a hamburger
or want to be a filet mignon.

536
01:04:54,600 --> 01:04:57,171
I strive to be a filet mignon.

537
01:04:59,800 --> 01:05:01,686
But I think I'm just a steak.

538
01:05:02,600 --> 01:05:07,640
But that's still not bad if you
consider what kind of meat there is.

539
01:05:15,520 --> 01:05:19,969
Am I a filet mignon?
-Absolutely.

540
01:05:20,160 --> 01:05:23,323
I just want love.
I don't have to be perfect.

541
01:05:24,800 --> 01:05:29,601
We can arrange that.
I mean I can do that.

542
01:05:29,800 --> 01:05:31,211
Really?

543
01:05:37,480 --> 01:05:40,848
Testosterone levels up ...

544
01:05:41,360 --> 01:05:45,331
Why the hurry?
- I have to go to Mary. I'm already late.

545
01:05:45,520 --> 01:05:49,969
From. You know you have to give her up
now the campaign is over.

546
01:05:50,160 --> 01:05:53,130
I know.
Shaver.

547
01:05:53,920 --> 01:05:55,490
To.

548
01:05:58,160 --> 01:06:03,410
So. He will be away from you, honey.
-Really?

549
01:06:06,880 --> 01:06:08,450
I have to leave.

550
01:06:15,640 --> 01:06:17,881
And I loved that laptop so much.

551
01:06:23,680 --> 01:06:25,523
What are you doing?

552
01:06:27,800 --> 01:06:30,531
Her energy fluids. She is dead.

553
01:06:30,720 --> 01:06:36,807
Why is she in your trunk?
-I wanted to recycle her. That how it's supposed to be.

554
01:06:45,360 --> 01:06:47,601
Do you have jumper cables?

555
01:06:48,560 --> 01:06:51,166
Do you have jumper cables?

556
01:06:54,200 --> 01:06:56,680
Then electrocute your hair.

557
01:06:59,360 --> 01:07:03,809
Turn on your engine.
I'm not going to kill her.

558
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:06,446
I thought you said she was already dead.

559
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:09,764
Turn on the engine.

560
1:7:27,600 --> 1:7:29,921
Damn.

561
01:07:32,880 --> 01:07:37,329
What the hell were you trying to do?
-I tried...

562
01:07:37,520 --> 01:07:41,411
Who taught you in the middle of a sentence
to say "damn it"?

563
01:07:41,600 --> 01:07:47,881
Are you crazy? do you want to kill me?
-Unfortunately.

564
1:7:48,800 --> 1:7:54.50
Rotwijf. You deserve each other.
You are insane.

565
01:08:01,760 --> 01:08:03,444
You..-

566
01:08:06,320 --> 01:08:09,961
Mary, come back. You may
best say "damn it."

567
01:08:10,400 --> 01:08:15,611
I don't know what's wrong with Mary.
She keeps saying "damn it."

568
01:08:15,800 --> 01:08:17,325
Mommy.

569
01:08:20,160 --> 01:08:25,769
Don't worry, I adjusted Mary.
She must be normal again.

570
01:08:25,960 --> 01:08:27,564
Normal, right.

571
01:08:29,200 --> 01:08:34,570
You don't want her to love you.
If she does, she will collapse.

572
01:08:37,320 --> 01:08:40,130
I'm late
for my recycling appointment.

573
01:08:50,560 --> 01:08:54,700
I really wish I could be
as you would like.

574
01:09:09,440 --> 01:09:12,330
Is this such a last kiss?

575
01:09:23,560 --> 01:09:26,882
Because I don't see you anymore,
can i sleep then?

576
01:09:27,800 --> 01:09:29,606
But I thought that

577
01:09:34,440 --> 01:09:36,841
They are going to recycle me anyway.

578
01:09:42.680 --> 01:09:45.524
I know you want me to stay asleep.

579
01:09:48,760 --> 01:09:51,286
Tell me what you want.

580
01:09:57,600 --> 01:10:00,126
I would like to sleep with you.

581
1:10:24,000 --> 1:10:26,820
I will miss you.

582
1:10:34,000 --> 1:10:36,480
Do you really care about my death?

583
1:10:44,480 --> 1:10:47,245
It's just a simple one
chemical connection.

584
1:10:48,600 --> 1:10:51,126
Even the oldest models can
to cry.

585
1:11:04,400 --> 1:11:10,820
I would still love you if you did
was a bearded Slavic soldier.

586
1:11:10,280 --> 1:11:11,645
Really?

587
01:11:12.720 --> 01:11:14.643
I love you too.

588
1:11:23,480 --> 1:11:27,700
I learned to love you
because of your love for me.

589
1:11:45,160 --> 1:11:46,889
Come on, Mary.

590
1:11:54,640 --> 1:11:58,804
I already told you that cheaper
models fall apart.

591
01:12:10,120 --> 01:12:12,771
How does that work...

592
01:12:14,160 --> 01:12:18,848
Did I kill her?
- It happens to everyone.

593
01:12:33,320 --> 01:12:38,420
And on behalf of Tang Soo Enterprises ...

594
01:12:38,240 --> 01:12:44,168
we want for a change
thank a man.

595
01:12:58.720 --> 01:13:01.530
I'm not going to talk about plastic.

596
01:13:07,920 --> 01:13:11,242
Do you all want women?
just like men are?

597
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:17,369
You can continue to wear a skirt
while you rule the world.

598
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:26,531
There is no superior or inferior.
We all have our problems.

599
01:13:27,840 --> 01:13:29,842
We need eachother.

600
01:13:41,720 --> 01:13:43,688
Do you like sushi?

601
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:51,367
Your shaver.

602
01:13:54,800 --> 01:13:57.406
That thing didn't work.

603
01:13:59,480 --> 01:14:02,643
In a few days
I would have stubble.

604
01:14:02,840 --> 01:14:05,207
And what about eating and sleeping?

605
01:14:07,640 --> 01:14:12,601
How can I sleep when I think how
it merges with all kinds of devices?

606
01:14:16,640 --> 01:14:19,450
If it is to comfort you:I envy you.

607
1:14:20,400 --> 1:14:24,170
Why?
-Your vulnerability.

608
01:14:25,440 --> 01:14:28,808
That is a quality and not a weakness.

609
01:14:30,440 --> 01:14:33,110
It didn't help me much further.

610
01:14:33,600 --> 01:14:38,686
I just don't know yet.
I would like to feel that way someday.

611
01:14:43,800 --> 01:14:47,563
She makes you happy. What makes it
then whether she is a machine.

612
1:15:11,360 --> 1:15:12.725
What is that?

613
1:15:26,800 --> 1:15:28,928
Has anyone seen Mary?

614
01:16:01,960 --> 01:16:05,521
Put your shirt up. Do you...

615
1:16:06.520 --> 1:16:11.242
I hated that thing.
-What is that? I know you.

616
1:16:11,440 --> 1:16:16,731
I know you. You are the girl from Paris.
Is that you?

617
1:16:4,920 --> 1:16:21,500
My death was meant for you
to give an obsession with my image.

618
1:16:24,720 --> 1:16:27,963
What are you talking about?

619
01:16:28,160 --> 01:16:32,882
I make genetic art people.
I work for Boyla.

620
1:16:33,800 --> 1:16:36,880
We test men's responses
on art people.

621
1:16:41,440 --> 1:16:43,100
I get it.

622
1:16:44.560 --> 1:16:47.848
You were not a robot at all.

623
1:16:49.240 --> 1:16:52.767
You are some kind of necrophilic
cynical bitch.

624
1:16:52,960 --> 1:16:55,725
I am precise
like when you met me.

625
1:16:55,920 --> 1:16:59,300
But I'm sorry
that I am not perfect.

626
01:17:00,240 --> 01:17:03,130
And I thought I was perfect
had to be for you.

627
1:17:04,880 --> 1:17:10,808
I studied you.
I know everything about you.

628
1:17:11,800 --> 1:17:13,564
Every detail.

629
1:17:17.920 --> 1:17:23.600
What you dream about
and what makes you sad.

630
1:17:25,160 --> 1:17:28,209
I liked you before I met you.

631
1:17:29,360 --> 1:17:35,811
They said you were such an old-fashioned man
who still wanted to feel.

632
1:17:36,000 --> 1:17:39,482
I wish you taught me
how i had to feel.

633
1:17:39.680 --> 1:17:45.130
I thought I killed you.
-I had to know if it did you something.

634
01:17:47,120 --> 01:17:49,122
Whether it did something to me?

635
1:17:49,920 --> 1:17:53,641
It wasn't about that.
It was about whether it did something to you.

636
1:17:54,960 --> 1:17:56.962
Wait.

637
1:17:59,800 --> 1:18:02,721
Why? Why did you choose me?
Don't ask me that.

638
1:18:02,920 --> 1:18:06,830
Why don't I have to ask you that?
Why me?

639
01:18:06,280 --> 01:18:10,569
You do not want to know.
Believe me, you don't want to know.

640
1:18:54,320 --> 1:18:58.211
So she's not an art person. So what?
Take the meat.

641
1:18:58.400 --> 01:19:00.721
I can not do that. She's holding something back.

642
01:19:00,920 --> 01:19:03,764
You are hopeless. We will
have a word about me now?

643
1:19:03,960 --> 1:19:09,490
I'm going out with an Australian babe.
She met me without a uniform.

644
01:21:23,520 --> 01:21:25,170
Where is she?

645
1:21:26,880 --> 1:21:29,870
Where is she?

646
1:21:33,200 --> 1:21:35,487
Let me see Paris.

647
01:21:43.120 --> 01:21:46.42
Paris, reference, films.

648
01:21:49,480 --> 01:21:53,644
I've been all my life
addressed with millions of names.

649
01:21:53,840 --> 01:21:59,244
I don't want a name, I'm better off
with a grunt or moan as a name.

650
01:22:02,640 --> 01:22:04,210
Dad.

651
1:22:11,800 --> 1:22:15,850
I was just eating a herring ball.
-Why do I love Paris?

652
1:22:16,400 --> 1:22:21,460
Because you are a woman under one
have met the bridge. She looked sad.

653
01:22:21,240 --> 01:22:26,167
You fucked like rabbits
and used butter with it.

654
1:22:26,360 --> 1:22:28,931
That was a movie.

655
01:22:30,640 --> 01:22:32,529
<i> Last Tango in Paris. </i>

656
1:22:32,720 --> 1:22:35,485
I have to think of a name for you.

657
01:22:36,680 --> 01:22:38,887
It's a sick movie, Dad.

658
1:22:39,800 --> 1:22:45,725
I have been millions all my life
names addressed. I'm better off ...

659
1:22:45,920 --> 1:22:50,642
Nonsense. It rained.
-It was raining like that.

660
01:22:59,880 --> 01:23:05,967
I couldn't do it, so they gave me you.
-Who are 'them', Dad?

661
01:23:06,960 --> 01:23:10,806
I'm sorry if I ...

662
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:15,767
I just wanted to
that you were normal.

663
01:23:15.960 --> 01:23:19.726
That you were normal.

664
01:23:37,720 --> 01:23:40,410
I do not want to lose you.

665
01:24:05,600 --> 01:24:07,921
There is no knife in it.

666
01:24:18.840 --> 01:24:20.604
Where's that hair?

667
01:24:22,560 --> 01:24:24,324
I want a hair.

668
01:26:08,560 --> 01:26:12,690
Blood replacement
at least tenable until 03-03

669
01:26:22,760 --> 01:26:24,603
It was time you called.

670
01:27:05,880 --> 01:27:08,486
I didn't want to wake you up, but ...

671
01:27:09,720 --> 01:27:11,768
If you can hear me ...

672
1:27:13,320 --> 1:27:20,681
I just wanted to say that I know
that somewhere deep inside ...

673
01:27:20,880 --> 01:27:22,609
you love Me.

674
01:27:24,480 --> 01:27:27,723
As long as we stay together,
we'll manage.

675
1:27:30,640 --> 1:27:32,290
Sleep tight.

676
1:27:43,600 --> 1:27:47,161
Ironic, huh. The most human ...

677
1:27:48,200 --> 1:27:52,410
man I know is a robot.

678
01:27:54,320 --> 01:27:56,607
My heart is too big.

679
1:27:58.60 --> 01:28:01.450
I'm working on that.

680
01:28:01,240 --> 01:28:04,608
Art people have
sweet in an old-fashioned way.

681
01:28:04,800 --> 01:28:09,886
People don't do that. People
don't even want to be people anymore.

682
1:28:10,800 --> 1:28:14,529
But do not worry.
I'm not killing you.

683
01:28:16,920 --> 01:28:21,881
I'm just recycling you.

684
01:28:24,840 --> 01:28:28,287
People don't want to
engage in love.

685
01:28:28,480 --> 01:28:31,689
They want to feel in love ...

686
01:28:31,880 --> 01:28:34,565
without the consequences.

687
1:28:36,400 --> 1:28:38,611
The colder the less you have.

688
01:28:38,800 --> 01:28:44,728
The less it makes you collapse,
the more I sell.

689
01:28:52.240 --> 01:28:59.440
She didn't program you for me
to keep. That came from yourself.

690
01:28:59,240 --> 01:29:04,485
Have we never been to Paris?
-I'm a bad memory writer, yes.

691
01:29:04,680 --> 01:29:08,366
But I am proud of the images
that I stole for your past.

692
01:29:08,560 --> 01:29:14,647
Crazy, huh. You thought you had me
created, but I created you.

693
1:29:14.840 --> 1:29:17.655
I'm actually your mother.
-Wait a second.

694
1:29:17,800 --> 1:29:22,442
I ... We are not compatible.

695
01:29:22,640 --> 01:29:27,123
So what? Then we have
a different life.

696
01:29:27,320 --> 01:29:32,326
You wear me when I'm old, and I make
you if you are defective. Come with me.

697
1:29:50,320 --> 1:29:53,642
Where are we going?
- What about Paris?

698
01:29:53,840 --> 01:29:56,446
I've never been that far away.

699
01:29:56,640 --> 01:29:59,883
Paris is less scary
then fall in love.

700
1:30:02,840 --> 1:30:05,320
I want to know your real name.

701
1:30:25,760 --> 1:30:30,402
At first I thought she was a robot.
-I wasn't that.

702
1:30:30,600 --> 1:30:33,490
That was me.
- He was.

703
01:30:33.680 --> 01:30:36.570
And we have been married for 42 years.

704
1:30:36,760 --> 1:30:43,120
Nine months and 38 days. And this
girl still looks exactly the same.

705
01:30:43,320 --> 01:30:45,243
The same.

706
1:31:48,600 --> 1:31:51,331
