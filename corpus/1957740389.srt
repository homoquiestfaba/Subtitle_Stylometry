[chimes, buzzes]

3
00:00:14,515 --> 00:00:15,558
[phone chimes, buzzes]

4
00:00:15,641 --> 00:00:16,809
Hmm?

5
00:00:23,566 --> 00:00:24,859
Holy shit.

6
00:00:24,942 --> 00:00:28,237
[vocalist sings upbeat song]

00:00:43,169 --> 00:00:45,004
[upbeat song continues]

00:00:57,892 --> 00:00:59,727
[upbeat song continues]

[brakes squeal]

12
00:02:30,693 --> 00:02:31,902
[sighs]

13
00:02:33,445 --> 00:02:34,446
Great.

14
00:02:43,247 --> 00:02:45,165
Hey, Alexa, I finished
updating your computer.

15
00:02:45,249 --> 00:02:47,001
- Should be all set.
- Thanks, Trey.

16
00:02:47,084 --> 00:02:48,836
- Good morning.
- Where is he?

17
00:02:48,919 --> 00:02:50,504
- Where's who?
- That man-child

18
00:02:50,588 --> 00:02:52,440
you helped get a sales job
here a few months ago.

19
00:02:52,464 --> 00:02:54,484
- Ah, him. Haven't seen him.
- Well, if you do see him...

20
00:02:54,508 --> 00:02:55,885
Don't worry. I'll let him know.

21
00:02:55,968 --> 00:02:57,303
Thank you!

22
00:02:58,888 --> 00:03:00,890
- Beep beep!
- Uh-huh.

23
00:03:05,102 --> 00:03:07,146
Hey, you wanted to see me?

24
00:03:07,229 --> 00:03:09,023
Great. You're both here.

25
00:03:09,106 --> 00:03:10,482
Both?

26
00:03:10,566 --> 00:03:11,567
How's it going, Parker?

27
00:03:12,526 --> 00:03:14,111
Well, it was going great,

28
00:03:14,194 --> 00:03:16,322
till I tried to pull into
my assigned parking spot,

29
00:03:16,405 --> 00:03:18,258
only to discover you couldn't
tell the difference

30
00:03:18,282 --> 00:03:20,159
between yours and mine... again.

31
00:03:20,242 --> 00:03:23,078
So you had to walk a couple spaces.
It's not that big of a deal.

32
00:03:23,162 --> 00:03:25,205
It's a big deal
because I earned that spot.

33
00:03:25,289 --> 00:03:27,124
And yet the short time
that I've been here,

34
00:03:27,207 --> 00:03:28,935
I've somehow managed
to close more deals than you.

35
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:30,119
Check your figures, Crawford.

36
00:03:30,169 --> 00:03:32,087
I closed on San tone Ford last week.

37
00:03:32,171 --> 00:03:34,091
Eight car dealerships
up and down the West Coast.

38
00:03:34,131 --> 00:03:35,299
Congratulations, Parker.

39
00:03:35,382 --> 00:03:36,800
King's Coffee Roasters, 22 shops.

40
00:03:36,884 --> 00:03:39,053
Bennington Books.
Contract goes out next week.

41
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:42,056
Part timer enters.com.
Contract came in last night.

42
00:03:42,139 --> 00:03:43,974
I've been at this company 9 1/2 years.

43
00:03:44,058 --> 00:03:45,368
You've been here, what, a minute?

44
00:03:45,392 --> 00:03:47,186
Imagine what I could do with 90 seconds.

45
00:03:47,269 --> 00:03:50,814
The two of you bicker
just like my parents,

46
00:03:50,898 --> 00:03:52,399
but I love it.

47
00:03:52,483 --> 00:03:55,486
You know why?
Because your competitive nature

48
00:03:55,569 --> 00:03:57,404
brings out the best in both of you.

49
00:03:57,488 --> 00:03:59,949
Plus I know that you'll go out
and close another deal,

50
00:04:00,032 --> 00:04:01,700
just to get the other one back.

51
00:04:01,784 --> 00:04:03,035
Oh, before I forget...

52
00:04:04,036 --> 00:04:05,955
- Happy Birthday.
- Oh, thank you.

53
00:04:06,038 --> 00:04:07,247
- It's your birthday?
- Yeah.

54
00:04:07,331 --> 00:04:09,131
Congratulations on turning
another year older.

55
00:04:09,208 --> 00:04:11,043
You did it! And it shows.

56
00:04:11,126 --> 00:04:13,337
How about a birthday hug?

57
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:15,297
Huh? No?

58
00:04:15,381 --> 00:04:17,216
So, you wanted to see me.

59
00:04:17,299 --> 00:04:20,469
- Yes, I did.
- Oh, you wanted to see her too?

60
00:04:20,552 --> 00:04:22,304
Yeah, both of you. Have a seat, please.

61
00:04:25,099 --> 00:04:27,434
Uh, wait, shouldn't Jacqueline be here?

62
00:04:27,518 --> 00:04:29,979
Well, Jacqueline, it turns out,

63
00:04:30,062 --> 00:04:33,065
accepted a position
over at Bernstein and Barlow,

64
00:04:33,148 --> 00:04:34,608
effective immediately.

65
00:04:34,692 --> 00:04:37,987
So, that means I need
a new director of sales.

66
00:04:39,989 --> 00:04:42,950
And I'm looking at my two best prospects.

67
00:04:43,033 --> 00:04:44,493
How do I get the job?

68
00:04:44,576 --> 00:04:46,787
What she means
is how do I get the job?

69
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:48,414
There's a potential client,

70
00:04:48,497 --> 00:04:52,292
which could be worth
a lot of money for this firm.

71
00:04:52,376 --> 00:04:54,296
I'm sure you're both familiar
with Goodwin Wines.

72
00:04:54,336 --> 00:04:55,838
- Mm.
- No.

73
00:04:55,921 --> 00:04:58,382
Oh, you wouldn't.
They make grown-up drinks.

74
00:04:58,465 --> 00:05:01,552
Well, turns out Craig Goodwin,
the owner of the company,

75
00:05:01,635 --> 00:05:03,887
is in the market for a new ad firm,

76
00:05:03,971 --> 00:05:10,019
so I've decided whichever one of you
gets him to sign gets the promotion.

77
00:05:10,102 --> 00:05:12,062
Wait. Whichever one of you?

78
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:15,107
Ah.

79
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:18,527
Speak of the devil and
he shall appear at your door.

80
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:23,240
Craig Goodwin,
please meet Alexa and Jason.

81
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:27,161
These are the two fabulous sales reps
that I was telling you about.

82
00:05:27,244 --> 00:05:31,415
Mm-hmm. Well, two of the things
I love in this world are...

83
00:05:31,498 --> 00:05:34,376
keeping folks on their toes,

84
00:05:34,460 --> 00:05:37,713
especially those I'm considering
going into business with,

85
00:05:37,796 --> 00:05:42,051
and the other is
good old-fashioned competition.

86
00:05:42,134 --> 00:05:43,969
To the victor go the spoils.

87
00:05:44,053 --> 00:05:46,680
Who's Victor? I thought
it was between me and Parker.

88
00:05:47,765 --> 00:05:49,058
Isn't it?

89
00:05:51,602 --> 00:05:52,686
Ah?

90
00:05:52,770 --> 00:05:54,730
[laughing]

91
00:05:54,813 --> 00:05:58,150
Ah, I'm kidding, right?

92
00:05:58,233 --> 00:06:00,694
You didn't say your guy was funny too.

93
00:06:00,778 --> 00:06:02,279
I can be funny.

94
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:04,740
Well, young lady, I am looking forward

95
00:06:04,823 --> 00:06:08,786
to hearing your ideas about
how to boost my company.

96
00:06:08,869 --> 00:06:10,996
- Debra?
- Hmm?

97
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:12,206
The presentation.

98
00:06:12,289 --> 00:06:15,793
Can I expect it on or by the 10th?

99
00:06:15,876 --> 00:06:18,087
- They'll be ready.
- Say, um...

100
00:06:18,170 --> 00:06:20,130
you wouldn't happen
to play golf, would you?

101
00:06:20,214 --> 00:06:22,925
Only... every weekend.

102
00:06:23,008 --> 00:06:26,428
I've got a hookup over at the Larson
Country Club, if you're interested.

103
00:06:26,512 --> 00:06:29,556
Larson? Man, I've been dying
to play that course.

104
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:32,184
Anytime you want to hit
the links, you just let me know.

105
00:06:33,185 --> 00:06:34,645
Good start, Jason.

106
00:06:36,396 --> 00:06:38,357
Okay, Craig and I
have much to discuss,

107
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:40,109
and if I were the two of you,

108
00:06:40,192 --> 00:06:42,420
I would do everything you could
to win over our new friend.

109
00:06:42,444 --> 00:06:43,821
[Jason]
Mm-hmm.

110
00:06:45,114 --> 00:06:46,406
Okay.

111
00:06:47,407 --> 00:06:49,243
Parker, wait up.

112
00:06:49,326 --> 00:06:51,870
Say, you wouldn't happen
to play golf, would you?

113
00:06:51,954 --> 00:06:53,539
You got to learn to read the room.

114
00:06:53,622 --> 00:06:55,207
He had a tag on his computer bag.

115
00:06:55,290 --> 00:06:56,917
- You know what?
- Let me guess.

116
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,120
You've given it some thought,
and you want to concede.

117
00:06:59,169 --> 00:07:00,838
No judgment. Really.

118
00:07:00,921 --> 00:07:02,422
Come on, we'll tell them together.

119
00:07:02,506 --> 00:07:04,341
Keep talking, Crawford. Pretty soon,

120
00:07:04,424 --> 00:07:07,094
it'll be about the time you
almost got that director's job.

121
00:07:07,177 --> 00:07:09,030
Don't you want to save yourself
the embarrassment...

122
00:07:09,054 --> 00:07:11,682
Of defeating you?
Why would I want to do that?

123
00:07:11,765 --> 00:07:14,309
I better not find your car
in my space tomorrow.

124
00:07:19,064 --> 00:07:23,235
Guess who's gonna be the Driscoll Group's
new director of sales?

125
00:07:23,318 --> 00:07:24,903
Debra offered you the promotion?

126
00:07:24,987 --> 00:07:28,198
Well, no, not exactly, but there's
only two of us in the running.

127
00:07:28,282 --> 00:07:29,283
Who's the other one?

128
00:07:29,366 --> 00:07:31,034
Alexa Parker?

129
00:07:31,118 --> 00:07:32,558
Yeah, but I wouldn't worry about it.

130
00:07:32,619 --> 00:07:34,538
She's been here, what, six years?

131
00:07:34,621 --> 00:07:35,914
Nine.

132
00:07:35,998 --> 00:07:38,709
Exactly. It's time for some new blood.

133
00:07:39,793 --> 00:07:43,755
Besides, that new assisted-living place
to move my mom into?

134
00:07:43,839 --> 00:07:45,299
I can really use the raise.

135
00:07:45,382 --> 00:07:47,217
Like you said,
with the new house and all...

136
00:07:47,301 --> 00:07:49,136
You're not the least bit intimidated?

137
00:07:49,219 --> 00:07:52,139
I have worked here since I was in school.
I've earned this.

138
00:07:52,222 --> 00:07:54,600
He has brought in some pretty big clients.

139
00:07:54,683 --> 00:07:57,269
Wait, you think she has a chance?

140
00:07:57,352 --> 00:08:00,063
I don't know. I mean,
if you weren't so busy

141
00:08:00,147 --> 00:08:03,442
fighting with her all the time,
think she might surprise you.

142
00:08:03,525 --> 00:08:06,153
Ah, please. She's nothing special.

143
00:08:06,236 --> 00:08:10,073
Come on, you can't tell me
he's not a little charming.

144
00:08:10,157 --> 00:08:12,743
He is a salesman, Hannah.
That's what they do.

145
00:08:12,826 --> 00:08:16,288
So, there's not a little incy-wincy part
of you that finds him attractive?

146
00:08:16,371 --> 00:08:18,790
I guess one would admit

147
00:08:18,874 --> 00:08:21,793
that she is technically
an attractive woman.

148
00:08:21,877 --> 00:08:25,505
Mm. You wonder if she's still
got that same boyfriend.

149
00:08:26,089 --> 00:08:29,468
Pleased to let you know I know
nothing about her personal life.

150
00:08:29,551 --> 00:08:33,430
Besides, I'm very happily involved.

151
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:35,891
Does Perry have anything special
planned for your birthday?

152
00:08:35,974 --> 00:08:38,268
He's taking me to lunch
at The Belvedere.

153
00:08:38,352 --> 00:08:40,395
Ooh, fancy!

154
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:42,119
You should have seen him
when he asked me.

155
00:08:42,189 --> 00:08:44,358
Hannah, he was so nervous.

156
00:08:44,441 --> 00:08:46,652
Wait, you don't think he's going to...

157
00:08:46,735 --> 00:08:48,445
I don't wanna jinx it, but...

158
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:49,905
[giggling]

159
00:08:49,988 --> 00:08:52,950
How are things with, uh,
what's-her-name anyway?

160
00:08:53,033 --> 00:08:54,159
Julia?

161
00:08:54,243 --> 00:08:55,953
Yeah. I get 'em all mixed up.

162
00:08:56,036 --> 00:08:57,579
It's been six months.

163
00:08:57,663 --> 00:09:01,541
Ooh! That's practically
an eternity in Jason time.

164
00:09:01,625 --> 00:09:03,794
Dang! This could be the one.

165
00:09:03,877 --> 00:09:06,213
- She knows I'm not that guy.
- Ah.

166
00:09:06,296 --> 00:09:07,881
And what guy is that?

167
00:09:07,965 --> 00:09:12,177
Oh, the overly needy boyfriend,

168
00:09:12,261 --> 00:09:14,930
one that's always talking about
the future, making promises,

169
00:09:15,013 --> 00:09:17,099
planning out the next 15 years, you know.

170
00:09:17,182 --> 00:09:21,186
And you're sure you're not talking
about what you don't want?

171
00:09:21,270 --> 00:09:23,105
She gets me.

172
00:09:23,188 --> 00:09:24,666
You know, we communicate without words.

173
00:09:24,690 --> 00:09:28,151
Uh-huh. Just a couple of mimes
in love, huh?

174
00:09:28,235 --> 00:09:30,612
Yeah.
[imitates heartbeat]

175
00:09:30,696 --> 00:09:32,447
Oh, I gotta go. I'm gonna be late.

176
00:09:32,531 --> 00:09:35,867
Okay, good luck. I know, I know.
I won't jinx it. Bye.

177
00:09:49,965 --> 00:09:52,759
I know, I get it.
Yes. Hundred percent.

178
00:09:52,843 --> 00:09:54,845
I know. Yeah, you're right.
No, you're right.

179
00:09:54,928 --> 00:09:56,722
You're right. I gotta go.

180
00:09:59,308 --> 00:10:00,767
Sorry I'm late, baby.

181
00:10:03,103 --> 00:10:04,980
Uh, such a crazy morning.

182
00:10:05,063 --> 00:10:06,541
I can't wait to tell you all about it.

183
00:10:06,565 --> 00:10:07,816
Who were you talking to?

184
00:10:07,899 --> 00:10:09,568
My, uh, my life coach.

185
00:10:10,152 --> 00:10:11,653
So, you decided to do it.

186
00:10:11,737 --> 00:10:13,172
It was such great advice.
I can't thank you enough.

187
00:10:13,196 --> 00:10:16,533
You remember last year when I was
stressing over that one account?

188
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:18,827
It did wonders for me.

189
00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:20,787
[chuckles]

190
00:10:23,248 --> 00:10:24,291
Is something wrong?

191
00:10:24,374 --> 00:10:26,084
Nothing.

192
00:10:26,168 --> 00:10:27,836
Nothing.

193
00:10:29,796 --> 00:10:33,717
Actually, there is something
I need to talk about.

194
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:35,469
- Um...
- Oh?

195
00:10:35,552 --> 00:10:38,180
Alex, I've been doing a lot of thinking

196
00:10:38,263 --> 00:10:41,641
about things, about us,
about these last 10 months.

197
00:10:41,725 --> 00:10:42,726
Uh-huh.

198
00:10:42,809 --> 00:10:47,522
And I think, well, that it's...

199
00:10:47,606 --> 00:10:49,524
It's time for us to, uh...

200
00:10:49,608 --> 00:10:50,609
Yes?

201
00:10:50,692 --> 00:10:52,027
To break up.

202
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:55,364
- Wait, what?
- I know.

203
00:10:55,447 --> 00:10:57,592
I hate that I'm doing this,
but my life coach thinks that...

204
00:10:57,616 --> 00:11:00,410
Wait, the life coach I recommended?

205
00:11:00,494 --> 00:11:03,372
She thinks that in order
to achieve my potential,

206
00:11:03,455 --> 00:11:05,332
I need to be unattached.

207
00:11:05,415 --> 00:11:07,793
You are attached. To me.

208
00:11:08,377 --> 00:11:09,378
I know.

209
00:11:09,461 --> 00:11:10,879
But we have plans for the future.

210
00:11:10,962 --> 00:11:12,297
No. You have plans.

211
00:11:12,381 --> 00:11:14,233
Honestly, I don't even know
what I want anymore.

212
00:11:14,257 --> 00:11:17,386
Is this a joke?
Am I being recorded?

213
00:11:17,469 --> 00:11:18,929
I know the timing isn't great.

214
00:11:20,931 --> 00:11:23,600
I'm being dumped... on my birthday.

215
00:11:23,683 --> 00:11:26,561
Oh, yeah, right, I forgot.

216
00:11:26,645 --> 00:11:27,687
Happy Birthday.

217
00:11:28,271 --> 00:11:29,606
This isn't happening.

218
00:11:29,689 --> 00:11:31,983
I... Actually, I gotta go.

219
00:11:32,067 --> 00:11:34,486
I have, like, a Zoom session
with her in-in 30 minutes.

220
00:11:34,569 --> 00:11:35,946
She'd wanna know how this went.

221
00:11:36,029 --> 00:11:38,990
But, uh, I really am sorry.

222
00:11:39,074 --> 00:11:40,700
You're a great woman, Alex.

223
00:11:40,784 --> 00:11:41,785
- What?
- Bye.

224
00:11:47,165 --> 00:11:48,542
Okay.

225
00:11:55,424 --> 00:11:57,426
Oh, my God. Are you okay?

226
00:11:57,509 --> 00:12:00,429
Great! I hate technology.

227
00:12:00,512 --> 00:12:02,973
This is an awful place you work.

228
00:12:03,056 --> 00:12:04,307
Just awful!

229
00:12:12,107 --> 00:12:14,025
I'm such a fool.

230
00:12:14,109 --> 00:12:15,902
I'm sure I.T. can get you another one.

231
00:12:15,986 --> 00:12:17,612
I'm not talking about the phone.

232
00:12:17,696 --> 00:12:20,240
I mean, I actually thought
he was gonna propose.

233
00:12:20,323 --> 00:12:22,363
It's such a cliché, right?
My whole life's a cliché.

234
00:12:22,409 --> 00:12:24,077
Not your whole life.

235
00:12:24,161 --> 00:12:27,831
One of these things is getting
the client to understand.

236
00:12:27,914 --> 00:12:29,791
Oh, there she is.

237
00:12:31,168 --> 00:12:33,378
- Hi, Brad.
- Hey, Hannah.

238
00:12:33,462 --> 00:12:36,756
So, what are you two
scheming about over here?

239
00:12:37,591 --> 00:12:41,303
Well, if you must know,
we were just, uh, strategizing

240
00:12:41,386 --> 00:12:43,555
about how I'm gonna get that account.

241
00:12:44,139 --> 00:12:46,141
- Oh, yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

242
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:49,144
Come on, Brad. Let me show you
what I'm working on.

243
00:12:49,227 --> 00:12:50,437
[scoffs]

244
00:12:53,190 --> 00:12:54,316
- Brad.
- Hmm?

245
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:57,152
- Let me show you.
- Oh, yeah.

246
00:12:59,112 --> 00:13:00,530
Uh, what was that?

247
00:13:00,614 --> 00:13:02,491
What was... That was...
That was nothing.

248
00:13:02,574 --> 00:13:04,201
What were we talking about again?

249
00:13:04,284 --> 00:13:06,036
- My broken heart.
- Right.

250
00:13:06,119 --> 00:13:08,455
Well, there's no one better
at talking the heartbroken

251
00:13:08,538 --> 00:13:10,749
off the ledge of despair
than Alexa Parker.

252
00:13:10,832 --> 00:13:14,085
You're like... the breakup whisperer.

253
00:13:14,169 --> 00:13:15,962
Well, who's gonna whisper at my breakup?

254
00:13:16,046 --> 00:13:17,339
Well, you can always call me.

255
00:13:17,923 --> 00:13:19,174
Uh, eventually.

256
00:13:19,257 --> 00:13:20,509
[Alexa sighs]

257
00:13:20,592 --> 00:13:21,927
Is it working?

258
00:13:22,928 --> 00:13:24,596
It's as dead as my love.

259
00:13:24,679 --> 00:13:27,599
Well, at least you backed it up
to the cloud, right?

260
00:13:28,683 --> 00:13:31,520
Ugh! I hate technology!

261
00:13:32,979 --> 00:13:35,607
Oh, here you go.

262
00:13:35,690 --> 00:13:37,692
- A brand-new work phone.
- Thank you.

263
00:13:37,776 --> 00:13:40,237
Yeah, okay, I've got some cases
you might be interested in.

264
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:43,657
That's okay. I don't really plan on
dropping it into another bucket of water.

265
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:45,242
Here's the one I use.

266
00:13:45,325 --> 00:13:47,285
Plastic screen protector, rubber casing.

267
00:13:47,369 --> 00:13:49,496
It'll keep her safe
if it falls out of your pocket

268
00:13:49,579 --> 00:13:52,040
- or slips off your desk.
- Yeah, but I'm good. I just... I...

269
00:13:52,123 --> 00:13:54,000
They call this one the lifeboat.

270
00:13:54,084 --> 00:13:55,877
It'll withstand about a foot of water,

271
00:13:55,961 --> 00:13:58,773
so in case you feel like playing
Angry Birds in the bathtub or something.

272
00:13:58,797 --> 00:13:59,798
Yeah, not really.

273
00:13:59,881 --> 00:14:01,508
Okay.

274
00:14:01,591 --> 00:14:05,679
This one right here, this is the tank.

275
00:14:06,805 --> 00:14:09,558
That's aircraft-grade
aluminum right there.

276
00:14:09,641 --> 00:14:11,327
You can get a running start
and punt kick this

277
00:14:11,351 --> 00:14:14,771
off the Transamerica building,
and it won't even crack the screen.

278
00:14:15,855 --> 00:14:17,440
Here.

279
00:14:17,524 --> 00:14:18,567
Oh!

280
00:14:18,650 --> 00:14:20,110
You feel that? Strong, huh?

281
00:14:20,193 --> 00:14:22,404
- Yeah, it's heavy.
- You can keep it.

282
00:14:22,487 --> 00:14:24,739
No, no, you...
I think I'm good with this.

283
00:14:24,823 --> 00:14:27,242
Thank you, though. I appreciate it.

284
00:14:27,325 --> 00:14:29,325
Hey, do me a favor
and backup your phone this time.

285
00:14:29,369 --> 00:14:30,370
[Alexa]
Yep!

286
00:14:40,213 --> 00:14:42,382
Hey, Julia, I'm home.

287
00:14:44,968 --> 00:14:49,222
You know, I was thinking,
why don't we get some takeout tonight?

288
00:14:49,306 --> 00:14:52,892
What was the name of that
Italian place you wanted to go to?

289
00:14:52,976 --> 00:14:54,394
Um...

290
00:15:01,985 --> 00:15:04,779
[Julia] "Dear Jason,
I can't do this anymore.

291
00:15:04,863 --> 00:15:07,616
I need to be with someone
whose idea of romance

292
00:15:07,699 --> 00:15:11,953
doesn't end with a jokey
Valentine's Day card."

293
00:15:12,037 --> 00:15:13,788
I gave that to you with love.

294
00:15:13,872 --> 00:15:17,709
I know you think you're here with me,
but you're really not.

295
00:15:17,792 --> 00:15:20,211
Goodbye. Julia.

296
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:30,347
[heavy sigh]

297
00:15:33,475 --> 00:15:35,352
[scoffs]

298
00:15:35,435 --> 00:15:36,561
Life coach.

299
00:15:55,497 --> 00:15:58,458
- Hey!
- Hey, there he is.

300
00:15:58,541 --> 00:16:01,294
What, uh... What number
are you calling me from?

301
00:16:02,629 --> 00:16:05,423
Oh, sorry. Work cell.

302
00:16:05,507 --> 00:16:08,593
Ah. So, uh, what up?

303
00:16:08,677 --> 00:16:10,136
What are you doing right now?

304
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:13,264
I have to work on this
presentation thing. Why?

305
00:16:13,348 --> 00:16:16,184
Wanna come over?
Play some Madden? Order pizza?

306
00:16:16,267 --> 00:16:19,729
On a school night! Bad boy!

307
00:16:19,813 --> 00:16:22,732
What's, uh... What's really going on?

308
00:16:23,817 --> 00:16:25,527
Julia left me.

309
00:16:25,610 --> 00:16:29,406
Wait, what? I thought you guys
were a couple of mimes in love.

310
00:16:29,489 --> 00:16:31,825
Yeah. Guess it's true.

311
00:16:31,908 --> 00:16:34,703
Everyone hates mimes.

312
00:16:34,786 --> 00:16:38,331
Well, I mean, if it means anything,
I'm sorry.

313
00:16:38,415 --> 00:16:42,001
If you're really sorry, you'd come over
and watch me beat you in Madden.

314
00:16:42,085 --> 00:16:45,171
I thought you weren't
the overly needy boyfriend.

315
00:16:45,255 --> 00:16:47,465
- I'm not.
- All right.

316
00:16:47,549 --> 00:16:50,844
Then it's all good.
Don't sweat it. You got this.

317
00:16:52,345 --> 00:16:54,180
Yeah.

318
00:16:54,264 --> 00:16:55,432
You're right.

319
00:16:55,515 --> 00:16:56,766
See you tomorrow?

320
00:16:58,351 --> 00:17:00,061
Yeah.

321
00:17:00,145 --> 00:17:02,856
All right. Bye, dude.

322
00:17:02,939 --> 00:17:04,149
Bye.

323
00:17:12,741 --> 00:17:15,368
Who actually remembers
phone numbers these days?

324
00:17:21,875 --> 00:17:24,461
555-01...

325
00:17:26,713 --> 00:17:28,256
2-8?

326
00:17:28,339 --> 00:17:30,049
8-2?

327
00:17:31,551 --> 00:17:33,136
0-1-8-2.

328
00:17:38,099 --> 00:17:39,642
[Alexa] Hey, it's me.

329
00:17:39,726 --> 00:17:41,644
I'm sorry in advance
for the extended text,

330
00:17:41,728 --> 00:17:44,939
but I just don't feel like
talking right now.

331
00:17:45,023 --> 00:17:47,984
And, to be honest, I don't feel
like doing much of anything right now

332
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:50,612
besides drinking Merlot
and crying my heart out.

333
00:17:55,867 --> 00:17:58,286
But hey, I heard red wine's
good for the heart,

334
00:17:58,369 --> 00:18:01,456
so maybe the night will end up a wash.

335
00:18:01,539 --> 00:18:03,082
[sighs]

336
00:18:03,166 --> 00:18:04,166
[buzzes]

337
00:18:05,335 --> 00:18:07,629
[crowd cheering on TV]

338
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:13,300
Wrong number.

339
00:18:16,763 --> 00:18:17,889
[sighs]

340
00:18:17,972 --> 00:18:19,307
[buzzes]

341
00:18:21,643 --> 00:18:23,829
[Alexa] My heart feels like
it's been torn out of my chest,

342
00:18:23,853 --> 00:18:25,730
thrown on the floor and stomped on,

343
00:18:25,814 --> 00:18:27,732
like someone was turning
a bucket of grapes

344
00:18:27,816 --> 00:18:29,776
into my next glass of vino.

345
00:18:32,570 --> 00:18:34,489
Wrong number, whoever you are.

346
00:18:38,076 --> 00:18:40,119
Next glass of vino.

347
00:18:40,203 --> 00:18:43,540
Could use that for the Goodwin pitch.

348
00:18:43,623 --> 00:18:46,209
[man on TV]
Let's play, let's play, let's play!

349
00:18:46,292 --> 00:18:48,294
And you are
preaching to the choir.

350
00:18:54,384 --> 00:18:55,635
[Alexa] Are you there?

351
00:18:58,596 --> 00:18:59,596
[phone chimes]

352
00:19:00,098 --> 00:19:03,560
[Jason] I am, but I don't think
I'm the you you're looking for.

353
00:19:06,187 --> 00:19:08,147
I think you texted the wrong number.

354
00:19:10,525 --> 00:19:12,569
Uh, sorry. New phone.

355
00:19:17,949 --> 00:19:19,784
No worries.

356
00:19:19,868 --> 00:19:23,705
I can't remember anybody's
number by heart either.

357
00:19:23,788 --> 00:19:25,999
You probably think
I'm some depressed lunatic.

358
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:30,169
It happens.

359
00:19:30,253 --> 00:19:32,964
To be honest, it's happening
to me right now too.

360
00:19:36,342 --> 00:19:37,886
Did you get dumped too?

361
00:19:38,887 --> 00:19:40,513
About an hour ago.

362
00:19:43,141 --> 00:19:46,352
Must be something in the air.
I'm so sorry.

363
00:19:46,436 --> 00:19:49,981
Really? When did yours go down?

364
00:19:51,149 --> 00:19:52,275
Over lunch.

365
00:19:52,358 --> 00:19:54,402
At least tell me it was delicious.

366
00:19:55,486 --> 00:19:57,280
I didn't even get to order,

367
00:19:57,363 --> 00:19:59,991
but I did manage to drop my
phone in a bucket of melted ice,

368
00:20:00,074 --> 00:20:01,534
so there's that.

369
00:20:03,411 --> 00:20:04,871
Which is how we got here.

370
00:20:04,954 --> 00:20:07,332
Which is how we got here.

371
00:20:07,415 --> 00:20:09,417
It reminds me of a quote:

372
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:13,504
"The more I know of the world,
the more I am convinced

373
00:20:13,588 --> 00:20:16,633
I shall never see a man
whom I can really love."

374
00:20:18,301 --> 00:20:20,595
Whoa. You've read
Sense and Sensibility?

375
00:20:21,304 --> 00:20:22,388
It's a classic.

376
00:20:22,972 --> 00:20:25,683
Perry, my ex, thought it was corny.

377
00:20:26,684 --> 00:20:27,977
Julie would say the same thing.

378
00:20:29,062 --> 00:20:31,123
She would say, "Why are you
wasting your time with that?"

379
00:20:31,147 --> 00:20:32,148
[chuckles]

380
00:20:33,149 --> 00:20:34,317
What do they know, right?

381
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:35,652
You know, it's a great movie.

382
00:20:37,862 --> 00:20:39,340
Would you believe I've never seen it?

383
00:20:39,364 --> 00:20:40,531
You're kidding.

384
00:20:41,366 --> 00:20:44,994
I don't know. I never like
when they make books into movies.

385
00:20:46,537 --> 00:20:48,498
You should see what they did
with Anne Steele.

386
00:20:48,581 --> 00:20:49,999
Hey, no spoilers.

387
00:20:51,751 --> 00:20:53,044
I'm sorry.

388
00:20:53,127 --> 00:20:55,755
But seriously, you gotta watch it.

389
00:20:57,048 --> 00:20:59,884
I'll put it on the list. Happy?

390
00:21:01,219 --> 00:21:02,470
Very.

391
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:06,516
[sighs]

392
00:21:11,854 --> 00:21:14,399
I should probably go wallow
in my misery for a while.

393
00:21:17,443 --> 00:21:20,238
Yeah, I should do the same thing.

394
00:21:22,532 --> 00:21:25,159
Thanks for the chat, though.
I think it helped.

395
00:21:26,577 --> 00:21:27,578
Me too.

396
00:21:28,746 --> 00:21:29,747
Good night.

397
00:21:31,541 --> 00:21:32,625
Good night.

398
00:21:51,853 --> 00:21:56,357
[alarm beeping]

399
00:22:34,062 --> 00:22:35,646
[sighs]

400
00:22:36,898 --> 00:22:38,066
Hmm.

401
00:22:50,620 --> 00:22:51,621
Hey, Cheryl.

402
00:22:51,704 --> 00:22:53,539
Hey, Parker.

403
00:22:53,623 --> 00:22:55,476
Crawford. You can try
and distract me all you want.

404
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:57,168
It's not gonna work.

405
00:22:57,251 --> 00:23:00,379
The fact that you're even saying the word
"distract" implies that it's working.

406
00:23:00,463 --> 00:23:01,881
Let's make a deal.

407
00:23:01,964 --> 00:23:05,093
I'll stay out of your face this week,
and you stay out of mine.

408
00:23:05,176 --> 00:23:06,928
Eh. Deal.

409
00:23:07,011 --> 00:23:08,304
Deal.

410
00:23:10,765 --> 00:23:12,350
I'm getting that promotion.

411
00:23:12,433 --> 00:23:14,352
Finally, we have something in common.

412
00:23:17,730 --> 00:23:22,068
Growing up here
in this beautiful vineyard,

413
00:23:22,151 --> 00:23:24,070
I'm reminded that Goodwin Wines

414
00:23:24,153 --> 00:23:26,572
is more than just a family business.

415
00:23:26,656 --> 00:23:28,574
It's a way of life.

416
00:23:28,658 --> 00:23:31,244
It is our great privilege
to continue to bring

417
00:23:31,327 --> 00:23:34,956
the best chardonnay
and cabernet grapes to the world.

418
00:23:43,714 --> 00:23:44,841
Knock knock.

419
00:23:44,924 --> 00:23:46,342
Hey.

420
00:23:46,425 --> 00:23:48,052
Uh, what's your phone number?

421
00:23:48,136 --> 00:23:49,720
I know Perry just dumped you,

422
00:23:49,804 --> 00:23:52,306
but you should know
I am nobody's rebound.

423
00:23:52,390 --> 00:23:54,225
Very funny. What is it?

424
00:23:54,308 --> 00:23:57,645
555-0128.

425
00:23:57,728 --> 00:24:00,148
2-8. I had 8-2.

426
00:24:00,231 --> 00:24:02,525
[sighs]
I'm lost.

427
00:24:02,608 --> 00:24:04,848
Okay, you know I had to get
a new phone yesterday, right?

428
00:24:04,902 --> 00:24:07,047
I still think you should have
gone for the waterproof case.

429
00:24:07,071 --> 00:24:09,866
Well, I was still feeling pretty
bad when I got home and...

430
00:24:09,949 --> 00:24:11,367
You should text me, silly.

431
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:14,287
Well, I did, or at least I thought I did.

432
00:24:14,370 --> 00:24:18,040
Wait. You didn't know my number?

433
00:24:19,125 --> 00:24:21,544
I'm your best friend!
How do you not know my number?

434
00:24:21,627 --> 00:24:23,629
Oh, come on. Who knows
anyone's number anymore?

435
00:24:23,713 --> 00:24:26,215
- I know yours.
- Yeah, well...

436
00:24:26,299 --> 00:24:29,927
Wait, are you telling me that
you sent a broken heart text

437
00:24:30,011 --> 00:24:31,679
to the wrong person?

438
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:34,223
Oh, no.

439
00:24:34,307 --> 00:24:37,143
Yeah, and I really poured
my heart out on that thing too.

440
00:24:37,226 --> 00:24:39,103
So, what happened?

441
00:24:39,187 --> 00:24:40,646
What do you mean, what happened?

442
00:24:40,730 --> 00:24:42,648
Were they mean?
Did they make fun of you? What?

443
00:24:42,732 --> 00:24:44,233
Quite the opposite, actually.

444
00:24:44,317 --> 00:24:45,902
The same thing just happened to him.

445
00:24:45,985 --> 00:24:47,278
It was a him.

446
00:24:47,862 --> 00:24:50,406
So, like, how long did you guys
message each other?

447
00:24:50,489 --> 00:24:52,283
I mean, not that long, you know.

448
00:24:52,366 --> 00:24:56,370
But it's nice knowing not every guy out
there is a complete asshole.

449
00:25:01,751 --> 00:25:05,087
And you're telling me you have
no idea who this woman is.

450
00:25:05,171 --> 00:25:06,172
None.

451
00:25:06,255 --> 00:25:09,091
No names, no pictures?

452
00:25:09,926 --> 00:25:11,177
It was freeing that way.

453
00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:13,429
I wasn't concerned about being judged.

454
00:25:13,512 --> 00:25:16,474
Wait a minute. You opened up
to this stranger...

455
00:25:16,557 --> 00:25:17,975
[whispering]
about your feelings?

456
00:25:18,059 --> 00:25:20,102
Brad, don't get crazy, all right?

457
00:25:26,525 --> 00:25:27,944
Maybe it's Julia.

458
00:25:29,195 --> 00:25:30,238
It's not Julia.

459
00:25:31,322 --> 00:25:34,408
You're sure she's not
playing some mind games,

460
00:25:34,492 --> 00:25:37,036
checking in on how her boy is doing?

461
00:25:37,119 --> 00:25:39,622
I think I would know
if I was being catfished.

462
00:25:39,705 --> 00:25:43,751
Ah, right, because you're
Mr. Sensitive now.

463
00:25:43,834 --> 00:25:47,505
And speaking of which, what is this?

464
00:25:47,588 --> 00:25:49,173
What? It's a good book.

465
00:25:49,257 --> 00:25:51,133
This is chick lit, man.

466
00:25:51,217 --> 00:25:54,095
Don't tell me you've actually
been reading this, have you?

467
00:25:55,513 --> 00:25:57,098
Heck no. It's Julia's.

468
00:25:57,181 --> 00:25:58,599
I found it after she left.

469
00:25:58,683 --> 00:26:00,309
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah.

470
00:26:00,393 --> 00:26:01,394
Okay.

471
00:26:01,477 --> 00:26:02,770
[buzzing]

472
00:26:07,066 --> 00:26:09,402
Hmm...

473
00:26:09,485 --> 00:26:11,570
Maybe it's her.

474
00:26:11,654 --> 00:26:13,239
Get after it.

475
00:26:14,657 --> 00:26:16,200
Play a, play a.

476
00:26:19,203 --> 00:26:20,246
It's my mom.

477
00:26:20,329 --> 00:26:21,831
[snickers]

478
00:26:21,914 --> 00:26:23,374
Is it really that funny, huh?

479
00:26:23,457 --> 00:26:25,960
What, your virtual
rebound girl? Mm-mm.

480
00:26:26,043 --> 00:26:27,920
Hey, she is a real person, all right?

481
00:26:28,004 --> 00:26:31,007
Hey, and you're a real mime, all right?

482
00:26:31,090 --> 00:26:32,425
Remember that.

483
00:26:33,259 --> 00:26:36,178
[imitates heartbeat]

484
00:26:39,890 --> 00:26:42,351
I had grilled cheese for lunch, Mom.

485
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:22,475
[doorbell rings]

486
00:27:26,562 --> 00:27:29,982
Who wants to have a ladies' happy hour
and watch The Bachelor?

487
00:27:30,066 --> 00:27:31,776
Come on.

488
00:27:31,859 --> 00:27:35,112
[Alexa] At least I can call this
research for my pitch, right?

489
00:27:35,780 --> 00:27:37,865
That's the spirit, no pun intended.

490
00:27:39,658 --> 00:27:40,659
Oh.

491
00:27:44,997 --> 00:27:47,249
Do you think it's bad to drink
after a breakup?

492
00:27:47,333 --> 00:27:50,044
That's what you told me
the last time I got dumped.

493
00:27:50,127 --> 00:27:54,090
Why is it so much easier
to dole out advice than it is to take it?

494
00:27:55,466 --> 00:27:56,634
Ooh, ah.

495
00:27:56,717 --> 00:27:58,969
Every time I burn my hand.

496
00:28:08,270 --> 00:28:09,939
Virtual rebound girl.

497
00:28:19,657 --> 00:28:20,783
Well?

498
00:28:21,867 --> 00:28:23,369
[sighs]
Nothing.

499
00:28:24,453 --> 00:28:27,665
You could always text him... again.

500
00:28:30,626 --> 00:28:32,545
I think I need more wine.

501
00:28:32,628 --> 00:28:34,046
Cheers to that.

502
00:28:43,597 --> 00:28:45,224
It's a onetime thing.

503
00:28:45,307 --> 00:28:48,894
She realized she's made a mistake.
She's moved on.

504
00:28:55,943 --> 00:28:56,944
[chimes]

505
00:28:59,613 --> 00:29:01,031
I mean, that could be anyone.

506
00:29:02,616 --> 00:29:04,869
There's only one way to find out.

507
00:29:08,539 --> 00:29:10,875
- It's him.
- I knew it.

508
00:29:10,958 --> 00:29:13,085
I'm not interrupting anything, am I?

509
00:29:16,505 --> 00:29:17,631
I'm not here.

510
00:29:20,301 --> 00:29:21,635
Hi. Nope.

511
00:29:21,719 --> 00:29:25,681
Just sitting here alone, doing research.

512
00:29:30,394 --> 00:29:31,479
Me too.

513
00:29:32,646 --> 00:29:34,315
Oh, tell him what happened.

514
00:29:35,441 --> 00:29:39,195
You're gonna laugh, but I figured out
what happened last night.

515
00:29:39,278 --> 00:29:42,865
So, I got the last two digits of my
best friend's phone number backwards.

516
00:29:42,948 --> 00:29:44,492
Funny, huh?

517
00:29:44,575 --> 00:29:46,660
Who remembers
anybody's number anymore?

518
00:29:46,744 --> 00:29:48,996
You... That's it.

519
00:29:49,079 --> 00:29:51,165
You both are made for each other.

520
00:29:52,249 --> 00:29:53,584
Oh, ask for a picture.

521
00:29:53,667 --> 00:29:55,669
Oh, no, I'm not gonna do that.

522
00:29:55,753 --> 00:29:58,088
He could be homely.

523
00:29:58,923 --> 00:30:00,299
He could be hot.

524
00:30:01,217 --> 00:30:03,135
Look, I don't want to ruin what we have.

525
00:30:03,219 --> 00:30:05,095
And I'm serious. It's not like that.

526
00:30:05,930 --> 00:30:09,558
Well, text me later
and tell me how it goes.

527
00:30:09,642 --> 00:30:11,101
All right, I will.

528
00:30:12,978 --> 00:30:17,525
You could get a name and make sure
there's not a podcast about this guy.

529
00:30:18,108 --> 00:30:20,069
Very funny. Love you, girl.

530
00:30:20,152 --> 00:30:21,445
Love ya.

531
00:30:25,699 --> 00:30:26,699
[door closes]

532
00:30:27,910 --> 00:30:30,955
So, should we exchange names?

533
00:30:32,206 --> 00:30:34,166
I like it better this way.

534
00:30:34,250 --> 00:30:37,878
No names, no work talk, no reason to lie.

535
00:30:38,629 --> 00:30:41,131
But we need to
call each other something.

536
00:30:41,215 --> 00:30:45,261
Jack and Jill, Bonnie and Clyde,
Sonny and Cher?

537
00:30:48,973 --> 00:30:50,140
How about...

538
00:30:51,225 --> 00:30:52,726
Him and Her?

539
00:30:56,230 --> 00:30:57,231
Perfect.

540
00:30:58,649 --> 00:31:00,150
So, what are you doing?

541
00:31:02,069 --> 00:31:04,113
Watching reality television,
drinking wine,

542
00:31:04,196 --> 00:31:05,948
and wondering
where my life went wrong.

543
00:31:06,031 --> 00:31:07,366
How about you?

544
00:31:08,450 --> 00:31:10,119
Just finishing off dinner.

545
00:31:10,953 --> 00:31:12,121
Oh, you cook?

546
00:31:13,455 --> 00:31:15,374
Yep. Made it myself.

547
00:31:19,169 --> 00:31:21,213
So, what are we watching?

548
00:31:23,299 --> 00:31:24,717
Oh, no, no, no.

549
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:27,177
I am not watching The Bachelor with you.

550
00:31:28,012 --> 00:31:30,931
You won't watch Sense and Sensibility,
but you'll watch The Bachelor?

551
00:31:32,474 --> 00:31:35,603
To be honest,
I'd rather just talk to you.

552
00:31:38,355 --> 00:31:39,356
Me too.

553
00:31:42,443 --> 00:31:43,444
Really?

554
00:31:43,527 --> 00:31:48,282
Yeah. I thought it was cool how you
put your feelings out there like that...

555
00:31:49,366 --> 00:31:51,368
even if you did think I was your friend.

556
00:31:53,704 --> 00:31:57,333
I needed to vent to someone.
I'm not mad it was you.

557
00:31:57,416 --> 00:32:01,045
Besides, I'd say we're friends
now, wouldn't you?

558
00:32:02,504 --> 00:32:03,964
I guess so.

559
00:32:04,548 --> 00:32:06,675
I take it you're not
the touchy-feely type.

560
00:32:06,759 --> 00:32:08,469
[chuckles]

561
00:32:09,928 --> 00:32:12,640
I think my ex would probably say no.

562
00:32:17,144 --> 00:32:19,146
Can I be honest with you
about something?

563
00:32:19,229 --> 00:32:20,773
Of course.

564
00:32:23,442 --> 00:32:25,986
I've never actually
told a woman that I love her.

565
00:32:28,197 --> 00:32:29,907
Really?

566
00:32:29,990 --> 00:32:33,369
Well, did your parents say it
to each other a lot growing up?

567
00:32:33,452 --> 00:32:35,871
As much as any other parents, I suppose.

568
00:32:37,456 --> 00:32:38,707
Are you close?

569
00:32:39,291 --> 00:32:40,376
To my mom.

570
00:32:42,044 --> 00:32:44,004
My dad passed away
a couple years ago.

571
00:32:44,713 --> 00:32:45,923
I'm sorry to hear that.

572
00:32:47,007 --> 00:32:49,009
Both my parents are gone.

573
00:32:52,930 --> 00:32:54,139
I'm sorry.

574
00:32:55,432 --> 00:32:57,142
I was always close with my mom.

575
00:32:58,977 --> 00:33:02,147
Sometimes I have these dreams
about my dad, and when I wake up...

576
00:33:03,857 --> 00:33:06,318
it's like I've lost him all over again.

577
00:33:10,906 --> 00:33:13,200
You do realize you just
opened up to a woman, right?

578
00:33:15,285 --> 00:33:16,578
Oh, bite your tongue.

579
00:33:21,875 --> 00:33:23,794
But I know exactly what you mean.

580
00:33:23,877 --> 00:33:25,504
I have those dreams too.

581
00:33:27,798 --> 00:33:30,634
I've always imagined my dad
walking me down the aisle,

582
00:33:30,718 --> 00:33:34,972
or that my mother would be there
playing with her grandkids.

583
00:33:36,765 --> 00:33:38,267
Why do people have to get old?

584
00:33:40,978 --> 00:33:42,646
Right?

585
00:33:44,732 --> 00:33:48,110
You know, I don't think I've talked
to anyone about this before.

586
00:33:50,654 --> 00:33:53,574
Me neither, not for a long time anyway.

587
00:33:55,659 --> 00:33:56,739
Guess I should thank you...

588
00:33:57,661 --> 00:33:59,413
for getting me out of my comfort zone.

589
00:34:00,914 --> 00:34:02,416
I needed it.

590
00:34:02,499 --> 00:34:03,959
No worries.

591
00:34:05,669 --> 00:34:07,129
I needed it too.

592
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:11,383
I better get going.

593
00:34:11,467 --> 00:34:13,027
I have an early meeting in the morning.

594
00:34:14,803 --> 00:34:16,472
Me too.

595
00:34:16,555 --> 00:34:18,056
Good night, Her.

596
00:34:22,603 --> 00:34:24,646
Good night, Him.

597
00:34:53,383 --> 00:34:54,718
So...

598
00:34:54,802 --> 00:34:59,640
this is our top cab from 2007,

599
00:34:59,723 --> 00:35:03,101
and one of my absolute favorites.

600
00:35:03,185 --> 00:35:05,562
Did I read that cabernet sauvignon

601
00:35:05,646 --> 00:35:08,440
is the most planted wine grape
in the whole world?

602
00:35:08,524 --> 00:35:10,651
And with very good reason.

603
00:35:10,734 --> 00:35:11,944
You're quite right.

604
00:35:12,027 --> 00:35:14,655
[chuckles]
Thank you.

605
00:35:14,738 --> 00:35:16,073
Well...

606
00:35:17,074 --> 00:35:18,784
- Salut.
- It's good.

607
00:35:22,371 --> 00:35:23,372
Mmm.

608
00:35:23,455 --> 00:35:24,581
Mm-hmm.

609
00:35:25,707 --> 00:35:28,710
Alexa, your considered opinion, please.

610
00:35:29,294 --> 00:35:30,504
It's fruity.

611
00:35:30,587 --> 00:35:32,923
I'm detecting notes of
black currant and black cherry

612
00:35:33,006 --> 00:35:35,467
with festive notes of green pepper,

613
00:35:35,551 --> 00:35:38,637
spice notes of vanilla and clove
from the oak barrels.

614
00:35:39,721 --> 00:35:40,722
Very good.

615
00:35:43,100 --> 00:35:44,268
And you, sir.

616
00:35:45,978 --> 00:35:49,523
I'm feeling some rich, complex flavors.

617
00:35:50,524 --> 00:35:52,985
Strawberries,

618
00:35:53,068 --> 00:35:55,112
sporty spice...

619
00:35:55,195 --> 00:35:56,238
[chuckles]

620
00:35:56,321 --> 00:35:58,657
...and some hints of cedar and caramel.

621
00:35:58,740 --> 00:36:00,492
Mm-hmm.

622
00:36:01,076 --> 00:36:04,454
Jason, you strike me as
a beer and wings kind of guy,

623
00:36:04,538 --> 00:36:05,706
but don't worry.

624
00:36:05,789 --> 00:36:09,042
I love hops just as much as the grape.

625
00:36:09,126 --> 00:36:12,671
Ah, a beer-drinking man.
I knew it, I knew it.

626
00:36:13,505 --> 00:36:15,632
However, wouldn't you agree
that one should have

627
00:36:15,716 --> 00:36:17,676
some knowledge of the product?

628
00:36:17,759 --> 00:36:19,720
Yeah, well, you don't need
to drive a Maserati

629
00:36:19,803 --> 00:36:22,097
to know how to sell one, am I right?

630
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:23,432
Right on.

631
00:36:23,515 --> 00:36:24,600
Mm-hmm.

632
00:36:28,437 --> 00:36:30,456
You know, I think I'm gonna take
a look around the property.

633
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:32,357
- See what comes to me.
- Good idea.

634
00:36:33,191 --> 00:36:35,152
I think I'll do the same thing.

635
00:36:35,235 --> 00:36:36,862
- Fine.
- Fine.

636
00:36:41,408 --> 00:36:42,409
Told you.

637
00:36:43,702 --> 00:36:45,329
Interesting duo.

638
00:36:54,922 --> 00:36:56,590
- [ding]
- Can you chat?

639
00:36:56,673 --> 00:36:58,592
I could really use a friend.

640
00:36:58,675 --> 00:36:59,927
[phone buzzing]

641
00:37:04,264 --> 00:37:05,682
Got a few minutes for you.

642
00:37:07,017 --> 00:37:08,310
Are you at work right now?

643
00:37:08,894 --> 00:37:10,187
Kind of on a field trip.

644
00:37:10,270 --> 00:37:11,647
I kind of am too.

645
00:37:11,730 --> 00:37:13,357
Certainly is a beautiful day for it.

646
00:37:14,441 --> 00:37:16,902
[scoffs]
I guess.

647
00:37:17,486 --> 00:37:19,988
Uh-oh. Sounds like
someone's having a bad day.

648
00:37:20,572 --> 00:37:23,492
I'm sorry. I don't mean
to dump all my drama on you.

649
00:37:24,326 --> 00:37:26,828
No, no, it's what I'm here for, right?

650
00:37:29,289 --> 00:37:30,791
You know what I mean.

651
00:37:31,833 --> 00:37:33,251
Right, right, of course.

652
00:37:34,544 --> 00:37:36,380
[Debra]
Alexa, we're leaving soon!

653
00:37:37,422 --> 00:37:39,257
Gotta go. Boss is calling.

654
00:37:39,341 --> 00:37:41,093
Talk to you later?

655
00:37:41,176 --> 00:37:42,928
I look forward to it.

656
00:37:45,097 --> 00:37:46,098
Me too.

657
00:37:59,987 --> 00:38:01,029
[door closes]

658
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:20,048
Are you there?

659
00:38:20,132 --> 00:38:21,132
[phone buzzing]

660
00:38:26,221 --> 00:38:28,390
I'm just finishing up
a real important conference call.

661
00:38:30,392 --> 00:38:31,935
Thank you for today.

662
00:38:32,019 --> 00:38:33,437
I was having a moment.

663
00:38:34,646 --> 00:38:35,814
I know the feeling.

664
00:38:43,196 --> 00:38:46,116
Do you ever feel like the world
is conspiring against you?

665
00:38:48,535 --> 00:38:51,204
Wow. Still bothered by the breakup?

666
00:38:52,289 --> 00:38:53,999
Among other things.

667
00:38:54,082 --> 00:38:56,376
I still can't believe he
broke up with me on my birthday.

668
00:38:58,295 --> 00:38:59,546
Sounds like a real prize.

669
00:39:01,256 --> 00:39:02,424
I thought he was.

670
00:39:02,507 --> 00:39:04,426
And now for the first time my life,

671
00:39:04,509 --> 00:39:06,428
I feel like I'm not in control.

672
00:39:07,554 --> 00:39:08,972
Control of what?

673
00:39:10,098 --> 00:39:11,475
My emotions.

674
00:39:11,558 --> 00:39:13,769
I tend to go overboard
in the worry department.

675
00:39:13,852 --> 00:39:16,438
I'm sure it doesn't help
that I'm having drama at work.

676
00:39:17,439 --> 00:39:18,565
Oh, yeah.

677
00:39:18,648 --> 00:39:20,108
Must be going around.

678
00:39:20,192 --> 00:39:22,819
You know, if you ask me,

679
00:39:22,903 --> 00:39:26,114
thinking you can be
in complete control of anything,

680
00:39:26,198 --> 00:39:28,075
it's just a pipe dream.

681
00:39:28,158 --> 00:39:31,203
As John Lennon would say,
"Life is what happens to you

682
00:39:31,286 --> 00:39:33,830
while you're busy making other plans."

683
00:39:35,624 --> 00:39:37,125
That was Allen Saunders.

684
00:39:39,127 --> 00:39:40,670
No, that was definitely John Lennon.

685
00:39:41,755 --> 00:39:43,757
Who took it from Allen Saunders.

686
00:39:46,510 --> 00:39:47,594
For real?

687
00:39:49,179 --> 00:39:50,263
For real.

688
00:39:51,973 --> 00:39:55,018
So, if you were me, what would you do?

689
00:39:55,102 --> 00:39:57,938
Do what I always do: go along with it.

690
00:39:58,688 --> 00:40:00,649
Try to make the most of it.

691
00:40:00,732 --> 00:40:05,445
And most importantly, don't concern
yourself with the wrong things.

692
00:40:11,118 --> 00:40:13,036
Is that how you're getting over your ex?

693
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:14,746
[chuckles]

694
00:40:14,830 --> 00:40:17,582
Trying to, thanks to you.

695
00:40:22,295 --> 00:40:24,089
Talk to you tomorrow, Him?

696
00:40:24,673 --> 00:40:26,174
Talk to you tomorrow, Her.

697
00:40:52,409 --> 00:40:53,702
[phone buzzing]

698
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:05,964
What do you think?

699
00:41:11,928 --> 00:41:12,971
I'm torn.

700
00:41:15,557 --> 00:41:16,683
Because of your ex?

701
00:41:19,436 --> 00:41:21,688
What if we met, and we ruin this?

702
00:41:23,064 --> 00:41:25,692
What if it's perfect the way it is?

703
00:41:27,944 --> 00:41:29,946
I really like what we have.

704
00:41:30,947 --> 00:41:33,200
I'm afraid if we met, we'd lose it.

705
00:41:34,910 --> 00:41:36,661
You're probably right.

706
00:41:36,745 --> 00:41:38,705
I'm really glad I met you.

707
00:41:42,250 --> 00:41:43,877
Me too.

708
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:45,253
Good night.

709
00:41:47,130 --> 00:41:48,131
Good night.

710
00:42:12,614 --> 00:42:14,532
You busted out the John Lennon?

711
00:42:15,367 --> 00:42:17,118
Allen Saunders, apparently.

712
00:42:18,203 --> 00:42:20,372
I don't know, man,
I think I'm with her on this one.

713
00:42:23,083 --> 00:42:25,502
Oh, come on!

714
00:42:25,585 --> 00:42:27,212
I think you're making a mistake.

715
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:33,718
Remember that woman I met
online, before Julia?

716
00:42:33,802 --> 00:42:34,803
The nurse?

717
00:42:34,886 --> 00:42:36,888
No, no, the paralegal.

718
00:42:36,972 --> 00:42:40,850
My point is that everything
was going great, right?

719
00:42:40,934 --> 00:42:42,435
We were talking all the time,

720
00:42:42,519 --> 00:42:44,396
we were texting back and forth
every night,

721
00:42:44,479 --> 00:42:46,106
then when we finally met in person...

722
00:42:47,691 --> 00:42:48,817
it all fell apart.

723
00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:50,443
Because she had a mustache.

724
00:42:50,527 --> 00:42:53,405
No. It's because
we didn't click, all right?

725
00:42:53,488 --> 00:42:54,489
So?

726
00:43:01,663 --> 00:43:03,641
I mean, wouldn't you just, like,
rather rip the Band-Aid off

727
00:43:03,665 --> 00:43:05,083
and get it over with anyway?

728
00:43:05,166 --> 00:43:07,210
It's a big enough distraction as it is.

729
00:43:07,294 --> 00:43:09,045
Maybe that's a good thing.

730
00:43:09,129 --> 00:43:12,632
I mean, with all my mom's bills,

731
00:43:12,716 --> 00:43:15,802
now I have to cover the entire
rent without... you know.

732
00:43:15,885 --> 00:43:17,137
Julia.

733
00:43:17,220 --> 00:43:18,305
I need that promotion.

734
00:43:18,388 --> 00:43:20,557
That's what I have to focus on.

735
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:22,309
Not Her.

736
00:43:23,768 --> 00:43:25,937
And you're right.
Alexa's tougher than I thought.

737
00:43:26,021 --> 00:43:28,898
Not to mention,
wine isn't exactly my forte.

738
00:43:31,276 --> 00:43:34,696
Look, you're the best salesman I know.

739
00:43:35,530 --> 00:43:40,076
I'd bet you could sell a hamburger
to a vegan if you really wanted to do it.

740
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:42,746
Well, at least I can describe a hamburger.

741
00:43:42,829 --> 00:43:45,623
Oh, great. Then you can buy me one.

742
00:43:45,707 --> 00:43:47,542
Funny.

743
00:43:47,625 --> 00:43:49,044
Seriously, though...

744
00:43:50,128 --> 00:43:51,963
I think you got something good going.

745
00:43:53,048 --> 00:43:55,842
And if you play your cards right,

746
00:43:55,925 --> 00:43:59,012
I think you could get the job
and the girl.

747
00:44:00,513 --> 00:44:02,349
- My cards, huh?
- Yeah.

748
00:44:02,432 --> 00:44:04,476
Yeah? Step aside.

749
00:44:04,559 --> 00:44:06,603
Let me show you bowling, all right?

750
00:44:06,686 --> 00:44:08,229
All right.

751
00:44:13,068 --> 00:44:15,779
[vocalist sings upbeat song]

752
00:44:19,032 --> 00:44:21,701
[upbeat song continues]

753
00:44:34,506 --> 00:44:37,425
[upbeat song continues]

754
00:44:50,980 --> 00:44:53,775
[upbeat song continues]

755

[upbeat song continues]

[upbeat song continues]

757
00:45:33,815 --> 00:45:36,067
[Jason]
I'm fine, Mom, I promise.

758
00:45:37,569 --> 00:45:39,988
Of course I miss Julia. It just...

759
00:45:40,071 --> 00:45:42,282
It wasn't right, that's all.

760
00:45:43,116 --> 00:45:45,368
I know, I know. I'm working on it.

761
00:45:47,370 --> 00:45:48,764
How many times do I have to tell you?

762
00:45:48,788 --> 00:45:50,349
I don't want you worrying
about that stuff.

763
00:45:50,373 --> 00:45:51,749
Just send me the bill.

764
00:45:53,793 --> 00:45:55,962
Yes, I'm keeping track of every penny.

765
00:45:58,673 --> 00:46:00,383
You're welcome.

766
00:46:00,467 --> 00:46:01,968
I love you too.

767
00:46:05,054 --> 00:46:06,514
I'll call you later.

768
00:46:08,683 --> 00:46:10,059
- Hey, what's up?
- Hey.

769
00:46:10,143 --> 00:46:12,854
Just wondering if you heard from Debra
about the date of the pitch.

770
00:46:12,937 --> 00:46:14,272
No, I haven't. Soon, though.

771
00:46:14,355 --> 00:46:15,482
Hmm.

772
00:46:18,359 --> 00:46:20,195
Is everything okay?

773
00:46:20,278 --> 00:46:22,155
Yeah, yeah.

774
00:46:22,238 --> 00:46:24,491
Yeah, I mean, I'm just sitting here,

775
00:46:24,574 --> 00:46:26,868
wondering what I'm gonna do
with the extra income

776
00:46:26,951 --> 00:46:28,369
when I bring in Craig's winery.

777
00:46:28,453 --> 00:46:31,206
There goes that common ground again.

778
00:46:31,289 --> 00:46:32,624
Yep.

779
00:46:42,467 --> 00:46:44,093
So, you think that's Him?

780
00:46:45,887 --> 00:46:47,514
Hannah.

781
00:46:47,597 --> 00:46:49,682
How about Johnny Smiles over there?

782
00:46:49,766 --> 00:46:52,477
Okay, stop.
It could literally be anyone.

783
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:53,770
Think about it.

784
00:46:54,562 --> 00:46:58,107
The girl of your dreams
could be sitting at that table,

785
00:46:58,191 --> 00:47:00,401
and you would never even know about it.

786
00:47:00,485 --> 00:47:03,196
Where is your sense of mystery
and romance, huh?

787
00:47:03,279 --> 00:47:05,257
[Hannah] And the two of you
are really not gonna meet?

788
00:47:05,281 --> 00:47:07,825
- That is so sad.
- We've decided not to ruin it.

789
00:47:07,909 --> 00:47:09,786
What if I've been prioritizing

790
00:47:09,869 --> 00:47:12,038
all the wrong things these years, huh?

791
00:47:12,121 --> 00:47:15,583
What if I'm finally realizing
it's about what's on the inside?

792
00:47:15,667 --> 00:47:18,503
And what if on the outside,
it's some 18-year-old kid

793
00:47:18,586 --> 00:47:21,839
messing with you from
his grandma's basement, huh?

794
00:47:21,923 --> 00:47:24,509
I'm being serious, all right?

795
00:47:24,592 --> 00:47:27,679
Why risk losing a connection
that we already have?

796
00:47:27,762 --> 00:47:29,514
By not being in the same room.

797
00:47:29,597 --> 00:47:30,932
Okay, enough about me.

798
00:47:31,015 --> 00:47:34,102
Are any of these guys doing it for you?

799
00:47:34,185 --> 00:47:36,563
These guys? Nah.

800
00:47:36,646 --> 00:47:38,523
I am happily single.

801
00:47:38,606 --> 00:47:40,525
Because you don't talk
to the girl you like.

802
00:47:40,608 --> 00:47:42,485
Oh, wow.

803
00:47:42,569 --> 00:47:47,240
So, what happened to the sense
of mystery and romance now?

804
00:47:47,323 --> 00:47:49,742
Wait, so there is someone.

805
00:47:50,827 --> 00:47:52,287
Maybe.

806
00:47:52,370 --> 00:47:54,956
Wait, do I know him?
Not Dave from accounting.

807
00:47:55,039 --> 00:47:56,791
It's not like you don't see her every day.

808
00:47:56,874 --> 00:48:00,503
Well, if you must know,
we talked this morning.

809
00:48:00,587 --> 00:48:02,964
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

810
00:48:04,090 --> 00:48:06,342
She said good morning to me.

811
00:48:06,426 --> 00:48:08,595
Oh, yeah? And?

812
00:48:09,929 --> 00:48:12,265
And I said good morning back to her.

813
00:48:15,560 --> 00:48:19,772
What? I feel like there was some
unspoken communication going on there.

814
00:48:19,856 --> 00:48:21,941
What are you waiting for, man?

815
00:48:22,025 --> 00:48:23,825
Why don't you just go up to her
and, you know,

816
00:48:23,901 --> 00:48:26,863
ask her if she wants to get
some coffee or something?

817
00:48:26,946 --> 00:48:29,324
She probably doesn't even know
that I exist.

818
00:48:29,407 --> 00:48:30,700
What do you think of Brad?

819
00:48:30,783 --> 00:48:32,827
- [laughs]
- What?

820
00:48:32,910 --> 00:48:34,329
You don't think he's cute?

821
00:48:34,412 --> 00:48:35,830
No, it's not that.

822
00:48:35,913 --> 00:48:37,582
So, what's the problem, then?

823
00:48:37,665 --> 00:48:40,752
No, it's just, you know,
he's friends with... him.

824
00:48:40,835 --> 00:48:42,629
He'd probably say
the same thing about us.

825
00:48:42,712 --> 00:48:44,505
True.
[laughs]

826
00:48:44,589 --> 00:48:46,341
Does it not bother you

827
00:48:46,424 --> 00:48:50,386
that she's, like, best friends
with your archenemy?

828
00:48:50,470 --> 00:48:52,013
Archenemy?

829
00:48:52,096 --> 00:48:54,098
That's a little harsh, don't you think?

830
00:48:54,182 --> 00:48:58,269
You know, I think Jason's not such
a bad guy once you get to know him.

831
00:48:58,353 --> 00:49:00,688
Well, that would require me
getting to know him.

832
00:49:00,772 --> 00:49:03,608
Wouldn't it be better if you two
could figure out a way

833
00:49:03,691 --> 00:49:06,778
to, you know, actually work together?

834
00:49:07,362 --> 00:49:09,381
Do you think would be better
if you actually tell Hannah

835
00:49:09,405 --> 00:49:10,823
how you feel about her?

836
00:49:10,907 --> 00:49:14,202
So... about Brad...

837
00:49:14,285 --> 00:49:16,287
Why not? If it makes you happy.

838
00:49:16,371 --> 00:49:18,623
Glass houses, my friend.

839
00:49:18,706 --> 00:49:22,251
Yeah, glass houses.

840
00:49:22,335 --> 00:49:26,172
Now we have to find someone who
makes you happy... in person.

841
00:49:35,556 --> 00:49:36,766
[phone chimes]

842
00:49:49,946 --> 00:49:51,364
This is good, right?

843
00:49:53,700 --> 00:49:55,118
See you soon.

844
00:49:56,619 --> 00:49:58,037
[whispers] Don't blow it.

845
00:50:07,672 --> 00:50:10,717
- Oh, no, no, no, I'm good.
- Yes, yes, yes.

846
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:13,720
This is one of the first bottles
my father ever produced.

847
00:50:13,803 --> 00:50:15,972
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

848
00:50:16,055 --> 00:50:18,266
This is quite a remarkable story.

849
00:50:18,349 --> 00:50:22,103
He started all of this with a few vines
in his humble backyard.

850
00:50:22,186 --> 00:50:23,187
Wow.

851
00:50:24,272 --> 00:50:28,568
I like to think there's a bit of his
spirit in every bottle of Goodwin wine.

852
00:50:28,651 --> 00:50:29,819
To your father.

853
00:50:30,820 --> 00:50:32,196
B.J. Goodwin.

854
00:50:34,031 --> 00:50:35,032
Mmm.

855
00:50:36,576 --> 00:50:38,578
He liked to quote President Lincoln.

856
00:50:38,661 --> 00:50:40,371
"If given the truth,

857
00:50:40,455 --> 00:50:44,667
the people can be depended upon
to meet any national crisis.

858
00:50:44,751 --> 00:50:48,629
The great point is to bring them
the real facts

859
00:50:48,713 --> 00:50:50,631
and... wine."

860
00:50:50,715 --> 00:50:53,134
[laughs]

861
00:50:53,217 --> 00:50:56,179
Is that what this is?
Some kind of test?

862
00:50:57,305 --> 00:50:59,515
My dad also told me,

863
00:50:59,599 --> 00:51:03,186
"A good boss should get to know
the folks he's working with."

864
00:51:03,269 --> 00:51:06,773
Or in this case,
may very well work with.

865
00:51:06,856 --> 00:51:09,137
So, how do I convince you
I'm the right woman for the job?

866
00:51:09,192 --> 00:51:11,027
I didn't bring you here to pitch me.

867
00:51:11,110 --> 00:51:14,071
- No?
- Tell me about yourself.

868
00:51:14,155 --> 00:51:18,159
Well, I believe a good campaign
should be about

869
00:51:18,242 --> 00:51:20,220
connecting with the consumer
on an emotional level.

870
00:51:20,244 --> 00:51:21,954
Not your business strategy.

871
00:51:22,038 --> 00:51:24,624
You, the Alexa Parker story.

872
00:51:24,707 --> 00:51:29,003
Oh, okay, well, I was born in San Pedro.

873
00:51:29,086 --> 00:51:30,755
I went to college in San Francisco.

874
00:51:30,838 --> 00:51:32,590
- Mm-hmm.
- And before he passed,

875
00:51:32,673 --> 00:51:34,842
my father spent his whole life
in advertising,

876
00:51:34,926 --> 00:51:37,345
and all I've ever wanted to do
was follow in his footsteps.

877
00:51:38,179 --> 00:51:39,180
Or be an astronaut.

878
00:51:39,263 --> 00:51:41,599
But I was lousy in science, so...

879
00:51:41,682 --> 00:51:43,518
[laughs]
Me too.

880
00:51:43,601 --> 00:51:45,978
You see? We're getting
to know each other.

881
00:51:46,062 --> 00:51:49,565
If I get this promotion,
it'll feel like I finally made it.

882
00:51:49,649 --> 00:51:51,526
You know, proven to him
that I can do it.

883
00:51:51,609 --> 00:51:54,695
I'm sure he already knows.

884
00:51:54,779 --> 00:51:57,281
And you'll most certainly get your chance.

885
00:51:57,365 --> 00:51:59,075
Both of you.

886
00:51:59,158 --> 00:52:00,743
Hmm?

887
00:52:00,827 --> 00:52:02,286
Didn't realize it was a party.

888
00:52:02,370 --> 00:52:03,746
Wait, what are you doing here?

889
00:52:04,705 --> 00:52:06,040
I invited him.

890
00:52:06,123 --> 00:52:08,292
- Wait, what?
- You're getting your turn,

891
00:52:08,376 --> 00:52:10,336
and I'm sure you'd certainly
want him to get his.

892
00:52:10,419 --> 00:52:12,922
After all, there's no reason
why this shouldn't be

893
00:52:13,005 --> 00:52:15,049
a fair contest, right?

894
00:52:15,132 --> 00:52:16,133
Right.

895
00:52:17,343 --> 00:52:19,220
Wait, you don't have to go.
He's early.

896
00:52:19,303 --> 00:52:21,722
Oh, no, no, no. I have a lot of work
to do in the morning,

897
00:52:21,806 --> 00:52:23,850
so I'll just leave you two to it.

898
00:52:23,933 --> 00:52:25,226
Thank you for the wine.

899
00:52:26,227 --> 00:52:28,145
I look forward to your pitch.

900
00:52:29,689 --> 00:52:30,731
Excuse me a minute?

901
00:52:30,815 --> 00:52:32,692
- Yeah.
- Okay.

902
00:52:34,569 --> 00:52:35,945
Hey.

903
00:52:36,028 --> 00:52:38,239
Don't you two have
some guy talk to get to?

904
00:52:38,322 --> 00:52:40,867
I didn't know he had us stacked
like this tonight, okay?

905
00:52:40,950 --> 00:52:42,368
This is awkward for me too.

906
00:52:42,451 --> 00:52:44,370
Okay, so what is this, like a truce?

907
00:52:44,453 --> 00:52:47,248
We're under enough pressure
as it is, don't you think?

908
00:52:47,331 --> 00:52:49,667
I overheard you talking
to your mom today.

909
00:52:50,501 --> 00:52:52,336
Oh, yeah, don't worry about it.

910
00:52:52,420 --> 00:52:54,213
Well, it sounds like she really needs you.

911
00:52:54,297 --> 00:52:56,382
You bought a house, right?

912
00:52:56,465 --> 00:53:00,428
Between the mortgage and taxes,
it's gonna cost a fortune.

913
00:53:00,511 --> 00:53:02,388
- Am I right?
- Yeah.

914
00:53:02,471 --> 00:53:04,390
Yeah, that's what
I'm talking about, Parker.

915
00:53:04,473 --> 00:53:07,435
There's no reason to make this
any worse than it has to be.

916
00:53:09,270 --> 00:53:10,563
What has gotten into you?

917
00:53:13,107 --> 00:53:14,567
I don't know. Just...

918
00:53:15,651 --> 00:53:17,737
I guess I'm feeling more human lately.

919
00:53:17,820 --> 00:53:20,573
Yeah, well, better late
than never, I guess.

920
00:53:24,410 --> 00:53:25,536
[phone chimes]

921
00:53:26,621 --> 00:53:29,415
My ride's almost here.

922
00:53:29,498 --> 00:53:32,543
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Get home safe.

923
00:53:33,878 --> 00:53:35,171
Thanks, Crawford.

924
00:53:48,392 --> 00:53:50,811
[phone ringing]

925
00:53:50,895 --> 00:53:52,396
What?

926
00:53:52,480 --> 00:53:53,773
[ringing continues]

927
00:53:56,901 --> 00:53:59,820
Hey, I wasn't sure you'd still be up.

928
00:53:59,904 --> 00:54:02,073
Actually, I just got out of a meeting.

929
00:54:02,156 --> 00:54:04,825
Now? It's kinda late, isn't it?

930
00:54:04,909 --> 00:54:07,995
I don't know. Why don't you ask
your life coach what she thinks?

931
00:54:08,079 --> 00:54:10,373
Yeah, about that...

932
00:54:11,457 --> 00:54:13,209
I miss you, Alex.

933
00:54:13,292 --> 00:54:15,086
I'm sorry?

934
00:54:15,169 --> 00:54:18,839
I was hoping that we could
maybe have lunch tomorrow?

935
00:54:18,923 --> 00:54:19,924
My treat.

936
00:54:20,007 --> 00:54:21,968
What, haven't you broken my heart
enough already?

937
00:54:22,051 --> 00:54:24,136
Baby, just give me a chance to explain.

938
00:54:24,220 --> 00:54:26,180
One lunch. That's all I ask.

939
00:54:27,264 --> 00:54:28,849
I'll text you in the morning.

940
00:54:28,933 --> 00:54:30,184
Is that a yes?

941
00:54:30,267 --> 00:54:31,936
It's an "I'll text you in the morning."

942
00:54:32,019 --> 00:54:33,938
Okay, I'll talk to you when you...

943
00:54:35,398 --> 00:54:36,816
[sighs]

944
00:54:36,899 --> 00:54:38,150
[horn honks]

945
00:54:45,908 --> 00:54:47,994
- What do you think?
- Hmm.

946
00:54:48,077 --> 00:54:51,664
A lot of the wineries up here
branching out into microbreweries now.

947
00:54:51,747 --> 00:54:53,499
Yeah? Yeah, I think it could work.

948
00:54:53,582 --> 00:54:55,751
Would expand your male clientele too.

949
00:54:55,835 --> 00:54:56,752
Mm-hmm.

950
00:54:56,836 --> 00:54:57,962
My father?

951
00:54:58,045 --> 00:54:59,755
Dead set against the idea.

952
00:54:59,839 --> 00:55:02,383
Yeah, my dad was conservative too.

953
00:55:03,968 --> 00:55:07,513
I'm actually kind of surprised
he trusted me to run the place.

954
00:55:09,432 --> 00:55:14,020
My dad always told me I'd be a salesman
or a talk show host.

955
00:55:14,103 --> 00:55:15,312
[laughs]

956
00:55:15,396 --> 00:55:17,398
He may have been on to something.

957
00:55:17,481 --> 00:55:21,110
Oh, man, they sure do have
a way about 'em, don't they?

958
00:55:21,193 --> 00:55:24,405
That's right.
You know, for what it's worth,

959
00:55:24,488 --> 00:55:27,825
I think you've really done
a great job with this place.

960
00:55:27,908 --> 00:55:31,787
It's a shame that he's not here
to watch you

961
00:55:31,871 --> 00:55:34,957
take what he's created
and really push it into the future.

962
00:55:35,791 --> 00:55:37,043
Yeah.

963
00:55:37,126 --> 00:55:39,545
Hey, to our dads.

964
00:55:39,628 --> 00:55:41,047
To our dads.

965
00:55:45,718 --> 00:55:48,220
So, you and Alexa...

966
00:55:49,305 --> 00:55:50,598
Alexa and you.

967
00:55:51,849 --> 00:55:54,351
No, no.

968
00:55:54,435 --> 00:55:58,272
Really? I thought I saw you guys
have quite a moment over there.

969
00:55:58,355 --> 00:56:01,067
Her and I? No. Oil and water.

970
00:56:01,150 --> 00:56:02,443
Don't forget.

971
00:56:02,526 --> 00:56:06,363
That combination...
can start quite a fire.

972
00:56:06,489 --> 00:56:08,365
[phone buzzing]

973
00:56:08,449 --> 00:56:09,533
Excuse me.

974
00:56:11,077 --> 00:56:12,369
[Alexa] Are you there?

975
00:56:12,453 --> 00:56:14,789
I really need to talk.

976
00:56:18,167 --> 00:56:19,543
Everything all right?

977
00:56:19,627 --> 00:56:20,628
Um...

978
00:56:21,629 --> 00:56:24,298
I'm not keeping you
from anything important, am I?

979
00:56:25,925 --> 00:56:27,343
I don't know.

980
00:56:27,426 --> 00:56:29,887
I think a friend of mine
might be in trouble.

981
00:56:29,970 --> 00:56:32,848
Oh, well...

982
00:56:34,350 --> 00:56:37,686
there are worse things to be in
this world than a good friend.

983
00:56:37,770 --> 00:56:39,688
You better get out of here.

984
00:56:39,772 --> 00:56:42,191
- You sure?
- Yeah, go on. Scram.

985
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:44,568
Okay.

986
00:56:44,652 --> 00:56:46,737
- Thanks for understanding.
- Yeah.

987
00:56:57,581 --> 00:56:58,582
[phone chimes]

988
00:56:59,834 --> 00:57:01,710
[Jason] It's me. Are you okay?

989
00:57:03,504 --> 00:57:05,422
I was leaving this work-drinks thing,

990
00:57:05,506 --> 00:57:07,508
and Perry FaceTimed me.

991
00:57:10,386 --> 00:57:12,763
You're kidding. You okay?

992
00:57:15,266 --> 00:57:17,059
I was pretty rocked at first,

993
00:57:17,143 --> 00:57:19,854
but then I remembered
I can't control everything.

994
00:57:19,937 --> 00:57:22,481
Am I worrying about
the wrong things again?

995
00:57:25,776 --> 00:57:26,986
Do not be in a hurry.

996
00:57:28,070 --> 00:57:29,864
The right man will come at last.

997
00:57:29,947 --> 00:57:32,616
[laughs]
Okay, Jane Austen.

998
00:57:32,700 --> 00:57:34,952
But how can you be so sure?

999
00:57:35,035 --> 00:57:38,414
You only know me from this,
whatever this is.

1000
00:57:39,248 --> 00:57:40,416
Because I can tell.

1001
00:57:41,709 --> 00:57:44,962
I'd be shocked if someone
didn't see that soon enough

1002
00:57:45,045 --> 00:57:47,047
and treat you the way you deserve.

1003
00:57:49,884 --> 00:57:52,386
Please tell me I didn't drag you
away from anything important.

1004
00:57:52,469 --> 00:57:54,889
I was actually at a work-drinks thing too.

1005
00:57:56,807 --> 00:57:58,642
Don't worry about it.

1006
00:57:58,726 --> 00:58:00,269
This was more important.

1007
00:58:03,105 --> 00:58:05,941
You're sweet,
and you're a really good friend.

1008
00:58:07,359 --> 00:58:09,820
Sweet dreams, Her.

1009
00:58:10,571 --> 00:58:12,990
Sweet dreams, Him.

1010
00:58:22,541 --> 00:58:25,044
- Let me give you my number.
- All right.

1011
00:58:25,127 --> 00:58:26,295
Okay.

1012
00:58:28,505 --> 00:58:30,132
Ohh...

1013
00:58:30,216 --> 00:58:31,967
I'd better go see what's going on.

1014
00:58:32,051 --> 00:58:33,677
Okay, no worries. See ya.

1015
00:58:33,761 --> 00:58:35,054
- Bye.
- See ya.

1016
00:58:48,359 --> 00:58:49,610
What did you do?

1017
00:58:49,693 --> 00:58:51,445
I told him I'd get back to him.

1018
00:58:51,528 --> 00:58:53,572
- And then?
- I hung up.

1019
00:58:53,656 --> 00:58:54,823
You should've called me.

1020
00:58:54,907 --> 00:58:56,575
I know. I thought about it, but...

1021
00:58:56,659 --> 00:58:57,826
[gasps]

1022
00:58:57,910 --> 00:58:59,411
You texted Him.

1023
00:58:59,495 --> 00:59:02,498
I couldn't help it.
It was like a reflex.

1024
00:59:02,581 --> 00:59:05,376
And you used to hate technology.

1025
00:59:05,459 --> 00:59:08,921
I don't know. He's just...
He's just a good person.

1026
00:59:09,004 --> 00:59:11,715
You know, and he makes me laugh,
and he's such a good listener.

1027
00:59:11,799 --> 00:59:13,133
I mean, not that you aren't.

1028
00:59:15,344 --> 00:59:17,179
He's my breakup whisperer.

1029
00:59:18,013 --> 00:59:19,640
So, meet Him already.

1030
00:59:19,723 --> 00:59:22,226
Hannah, seriously,
I've never been friends with a guy

1031
00:59:22,309 --> 00:59:23,978
where there's just no pressure.

1032
00:59:24,061 --> 00:59:26,397
It's just natural with Him.

1033
00:59:26,480 --> 00:59:28,357
Honest. Fun.

1034
00:59:28,941 --> 00:59:30,442
If you say so.

1035
00:59:30,526 --> 00:59:33,237
But speaking of pressure...

1036
00:59:33,320 --> 00:59:35,698
[groans]
Perry. I know.

1037
00:59:35,781 --> 00:59:37,074
[sighs]

1038
00:59:37,157 --> 00:59:40,202
I mean, he did sound pretty sincere.

1039
00:59:40,286 --> 00:59:42,162
And it's just lunch, right?

1040
00:59:42,246 --> 00:59:43,664
You tell me.

1041
00:59:59,805 --> 01:00:00,973
You made it.

1042
01:00:01,056 --> 01:00:02,224
I made it.

1043
01:00:05,436 --> 01:00:07,479
Never thought I'd come back here.

1044
01:00:08,564 --> 01:00:10,065
Um, I took the liberty.

1045
01:00:10,149 --> 01:00:11,859
I know you prefer red.

1046
01:00:11,942 --> 01:00:13,402
[chuckles]

1047
01:00:13,485 --> 01:00:15,154
Sporty spice.

1048
01:00:15,237 --> 01:00:16,405
What's that?

1049
01:00:17,239 --> 01:00:18,240
Uh, nothing.

1050
01:00:20,743 --> 01:00:21,744
How's work?

1051
01:00:21,827 --> 01:00:23,370
It's good.

1052
01:00:23,454 --> 01:00:24,955
Still working on that promotion?

1053
01:00:26,040 --> 01:00:28,000
Look, you didn't ask me here
to talk about my job.

1054
01:00:28,083 --> 01:00:29,460
Look, what's going on?

1055
01:00:30,919 --> 01:00:33,339
I owe you a big apology, Alex.

1056
01:00:33,422 --> 01:00:34,923
I was stupid.

1057
01:00:35,007 --> 01:00:38,052
I was impulsive. I was wrong.

1058
01:00:38,135 --> 01:00:40,846
Is this some kind of self-help exercise?

1059
01:00:40,929 --> 01:00:42,848
Your life coach put you up to this too?

1060
01:00:42,931 --> 01:00:44,183
I was scared, Alex.

1061
01:00:44,266 --> 01:00:47,394
We had been together for 10 months.
We were practically living together.

1062
01:00:47,478 --> 01:00:49,480
I knew what the next step
was supposed to be.

1063
01:00:50,689 --> 01:00:53,192
But instead of making
that commitment, I ran.

1064
01:00:53,275 --> 01:00:54,902
Yeah.

1065
01:00:54,985 --> 01:00:57,196
The truth is you're smart...

1066
01:00:58,280 --> 01:00:59,698
you are beautiful...

1067
01:01:00,783 --> 01:01:04,828
and yeah, sometimes
I get intimidated by you,

1068
01:01:04,912 --> 01:01:06,580
but that's okay.

1069
01:01:06,663 --> 01:01:08,457
I just...

1070
01:01:08,540 --> 01:01:11,752
I don't want a future
that doesn't have you in it.

1071
01:01:17,174 --> 01:01:20,052
[beeping]

1072
01:01:24,056 --> 01:01:25,056
[phone buzzing]

1073
01:01:26,016 --> 01:01:27,017
[Alexa] Guess what.

1074
01:01:28,560 --> 01:01:29,603
Hey.

1075
01:01:33,107 --> 01:01:34,358
[phone buzzing]

1076
01:01:34,441 --> 01:01:36,693
Perry asked me to take him back.

1077
01:01:38,404 --> 01:01:42,199
He said he was sorry,
that he really sees a future with me.

1078
01:01:45,869 --> 01:01:47,329
[Jason] Wow.

1079
01:01:47,413 --> 01:01:49,832
That's really something.

1080
01:01:55,671 --> 01:01:57,673
He asked me to go out with him tonight.

1081
01:02:04,221 --> 01:02:06,849
Good for you. Really happy for you.

1082
01:02:09,017 --> 01:02:10,644
Are you sure?

1083
01:02:10,727 --> 01:02:12,938
You don't think it's a mistake, do you?

1084
01:02:17,067 --> 01:02:19,445
No, really, it's great.

1085
01:02:20,446 --> 01:02:21,613
You deserve this.

1086
01:02:22,698 --> 01:02:24,324
Thanks for the update.

1087
01:02:27,911 --> 01:02:30,289
Wait, are you mad?

1088
01:02:36,086 --> 01:02:37,087
No, not at all.

1089
01:02:38,714 --> 01:02:40,799
But I should get back to work now.

1090
01:02:53,061 --> 01:02:54,188
- [phone hits floor]
- Ooh.

1091
01:02:57,107 --> 01:02:58,901
Here. Good as new.

1092
01:03:00,486 --> 01:03:02,338
Can't believe I accidentally
dropped it like that.

1093
01:03:02,362 --> 01:03:06,783
Well, as my two-minute yoga app says,
"Everything happens for a reason."

1094
01:03:07,868 --> 01:03:09,453
If you say so, Trey.

1095
01:03:09,536 --> 01:03:12,122
Um, hey, be glad it wasn't broken, though,

1096
01:03:12,206 --> 01:03:14,583
because I gave my last new phone
to Alexa last week.

1097
01:03:16,418 --> 01:03:17,753
- Oh.
- Yeah.

1098
01:03:17,836 --> 01:03:19,630
- Alexa got a new phone?
- Oh, yeah.

1099
01:03:19,713 --> 01:03:23,300
Said she dropped her other one
in a bucket of water or something.

1100
01:03:24,384 --> 01:03:28,222
Anyway, if you think you're gonna
drop it again, I have got some cases.

1101
01:03:28,805 --> 01:03:31,058
Oh, I'm good. Thanks though.

1102
01:03:37,314 --> 01:03:42,194
Curious. How are the numbers
assigned on these?

1103
01:03:42,277 --> 01:03:44,321
Company's got
a whole block of numbers.

1104
01:03:44,404 --> 01:03:46,406
They're all sequential. Why?

1105
01:03:54,206 --> 01:03:55,207
You talk to Hannah?

1106
01:03:55,290 --> 01:03:58,585
Mm-hmm. Guess who's going
hiking with her this weekend?

1107
01:03:58,669 --> 01:04:00,879
- Hoo-hoo!
- Can I have her phone number?

1108
01:04:00,963 --> 01:04:03,298
No. Slow down. I asked her first.

1109
01:04:03,382 --> 01:04:05,842
Please. I need the number.

1110
01:04:07,970 --> 01:04:09,388
All right.

1111
01:04:09,471 --> 01:04:10,764
It's, uh...

1112
01:04:10,847 --> 01:04:15,227
555-0128.

1113
01:04:18,230 --> 01:04:20,524
5-0-1-8-2.

1114
01:04:20,607 --> 01:04:22,067
Yeah, so?

1115
01:04:24,152 --> 01:04:26,071
Two digits backwards.

1116
01:04:26,154 --> 01:04:27,739
[Alexa] I got the last two digits

1117
01:04:27,823 --> 01:04:29,950
of my best friend's
phone number backwards.

1118
01:04:32,160 --> 01:04:33,787
Are you good, man?

1119
01:04:36,623 --> 01:04:37,708
Oh, boy.

1120
01:04:38,792 --> 01:04:39,793
[Brad] Jason?

1121
01:04:42,504 --> 01:04:44,732
I still can't believe he broke
up with me on my birthday.

1122
01:04:44,756 --> 01:04:46,174
Oh, it's your birthday?

1123
01:04:50,846 --> 01:04:54,850
I was leaving this work-drinks thing,
and Perry FaceTimed me.

1124
01:04:54,933 --> 01:04:57,436
I was actually at a work-drinks thing too.

1125
01:04:58,854 --> 01:05:00,105
Alexa.

1126
01:05:02,566 --> 01:05:03,567
It's her.

1127
01:05:22,836 --> 01:05:25,088
- Hey, hot shot!
- Yeah.

1128
01:05:25,172 --> 01:05:27,174
Can you come here
for a second, please?

1129
01:05:29,426 --> 01:05:31,786
I just wanted to make sure that
you were ready for tomorrow.

1130
01:05:32,262 --> 01:05:33,263
What?

1131
01:05:33,347 --> 01:05:36,433
[chuckles]
Really? For the pitch.

1132
01:05:36,516 --> 01:05:38,226
The winery, the promotion.

1133
01:05:38,310 --> 01:05:40,729
Oh, yeah, yeah, I'm ready.
Got it right here.

1134
01:05:40,812 --> 01:05:42,564
Are you sure?
'Cause you seem a little...

1135
01:05:42,648 --> 01:05:44,459
Yeah, no, I'm fine, I'm fine.
Everything's here.

1136
01:05:44,483 --> 01:05:46,360
I'm ready, prepared, ready to go.

1137
01:05:46,443 --> 01:05:49,196
I couldn't help but notice that
it's a little quiet around here.

1138
01:05:49,279 --> 01:05:51,531
I thought there might have been
a little bit of fireworks

1139
01:05:51,615 --> 01:05:53,575
between you and Alexa
before the big event.

1140
01:05:53,659 --> 01:05:57,079
Yeah, I guess you could say
that we've just been, um...

1141
01:05:57,162 --> 01:05:59,140
dealing with each other
a little differently lately.

1142
01:05:59,164 --> 01:06:01,833
Well, as long as one of you
gets that contract.

1143
01:06:01,917 --> 01:06:03,168
Yeah.

1144
01:06:03,251 --> 01:06:05,921
Then you guys can deal with each other
however you want.

1145
01:06:07,673 --> 01:06:09,091
Yeah.

1146
01:06:09,174 --> 01:06:12,219
All right, good.
Well, I will see you tomorrow.

1147
01:06:12,302 --> 01:06:14,846
Yeah. Have a good night.

1148
01:06:14,930 --> 01:06:16,390
Get some rest.

1149
01:06:16,473 --> 01:06:17,516
I will.

1150
01:06:21,061 --> 01:06:23,647
This place is really nice.
I didn't even know it was here.

1151
01:06:23,730 --> 01:06:25,232
It's actually a family business.

1152
01:06:25,315 --> 01:06:26,751
Would you believe the father
started in the backyard

1153
01:06:26,775 --> 01:06:28,068
with just a few vines?

1154
01:06:28,151 --> 01:06:29,611
- Wow.
- Yeah.

1155
01:06:29,695 --> 01:06:31,697
You know a lot about this place.
Are they clients?

1156
01:06:31,780 --> 01:06:32,906
Hopefully.

1157
01:06:32,989 --> 01:06:34,658
Just can't stay away, huh?

1158
01:06:34,741 --> 01:06:36,910
You're here!

1159
01:06:36,993 --> 01:06:38,787
Perry, I want you to meet
Craig, the owner.

1160
01:06:38,870 --> 01:06:40,515
His father is the one
who started the place.

1161
01:06:40,539 --> 01:06:42,249
- Good to meet you.
- Likewise.

1162
01:06:42,332 --> 01:06:44,435
I was just telling Alexa what
an amazing place you have here.

1163
01:06:44,459 --> 01:06:46,753
Well, thank you. It's home.

1164
01:06:46,837 --> 01:06:51,466
If you ever need help managing
your financial portfolio...

1165
01:06:51,550 --> 01:06:55,303
Well, that's good to know.

1166
01:06:55,387 --> 01:06:57,639
- Please.
- Yeah.

1167
01:06:57,723 --> 01:07:00,642
Alexa, how are you feeling
about tomorrow?

1168
01:07:00,726 --> 01:07:03,145
I feel good. I feel like
I've got some real solid ideas

1169
01:07:03,228 --> 01:07:05,147
on how we can extend
your father's legacy.

1170
01:07:05,230 --> 01:07:07,065
Excellent.

1171
01:07:07,149 --> 01:07:10,944
I must say, you and your colleague Jason
are an intriguing pair.

1172
01:07:11,027 --> 01:07:12,821
You seem to really spark
off of each other.

1173
01:07:12,904 --> 01:07:15,490
Nobody works harder than this
lady, I can promise you that.

1174
01:07:15,574 --> 01:07:18,952
No doubt. Now, listen,
don't let me interrupt your evening.

1175
01:07:19,035 --> 01:07:21,413
But remember,
mi casa es su casa.

1176
01:07:21,496 --> 01:07:22,956
Aw, thank you.

1177
01:07:23,832 --> 01:07:25,041
It was nice meeting you.

1178
01:07:34,468 --> 01:07:36,178
Thanks for tonight.

1179
01:07:36,261 --> 01:07:38,972
Normally I'd be pacing my
living room before a big pitch,

1180
01:07:39,055 --> 01:07:41,015
especially with the stakes
dangling over this one.

1181
01:07:41,057 --> 01:07:42,535
I feel like I should be thanking you.

1182
01:07:42,559 --> 01:07:44,478
- For what?
- For giving me a second chance.

1183
01:07:44,561 --> 01:07:46,438
Look...

1184
01:07:46,521 --> 01:07:47,939
- I've been thinking.
- Perry...

1185
01:07:48,023 --> 01:07:49,583
I think we should get a place together.

1186
01:07:50,150 --> 01:07:51,193
What?

1187
01:07:51,276 --> 01:07:54,321
I'm at your place all the time as it is,
or at least I was.

1188
01:07:54,404 --> 01:07:56,072
Yeah, but I just bought the house.

1189
01:07:56,156 --> 01:07:58,033
- I've just gotten settled.
- Great.

1190
01:07:58,116 --> 01:08:00,368
So, we can live there.
I'll even help with the mortgage.

1191
01:08:00,452 --> 01:08:02,370
What happened to
not talking about the future?

1192
01:08:02,454 --> 01:08:04,331
I'm done running away
from commitment.

1193
01:08:04,414 --> 01:08:06,416
[scoffs]
Life is what happens

1194
01:08:06,500 --> 01:08:08,335
when you're busy making other plans.

1195
01:08:08,418 --> 01:08:09,628
What's that?

1196
01:08:11,087 --> 01:08:15,008
Nothing. Just something
a friend of mine said.

1197
01:08:15,091 --> 01:08:18,303
Alexa Parker, are you learning
to live in the moment?

1198
01:08:18,386 --> 01:08:20,305
Maybe I'm just trying
to make the best of it.

1199
01:08:20,388 --> 01:08:23,225
You don't have to decide tonight, but...

1200
01:08:23,308 --> 01:08:24,851
I don't want to lose you again.

1201
01:08:33,693 --> 01:08:36,947
[vocalist sings romantic song]

1202
01:08:55,131 --> 01:08:57,926
[romantic song continues]

1203
01:09:18,446 --> 01:09:19,531
[ding]

1204
01:09:20,949 --> 01:09:21,950
Hey.

1205
01:09:22,033 --> 01:09:23,451
[phone buzzing]

1206
01:09:27,956 --> 01:09:29,457
So, how did your date go?

1207
01:09:31,501 --> 01:09:34,296
He wants us to move in together.

1208
01:09:37,048 --> 01:09:39,759
Wow. That was fast.

1209
01:09:42,470 --> 01:09:44,389
Funny thing is, two weeks ago,

1210
01:09:44,472 --> 01:09:46,308
I would've killed
for this kind of commitment.

1211
01:09:46,391 --> 01:09:47,809
But not now?

1212
01:09:50,770 --> 01:09:52,772
I mean, I should be happy, right?

1213
01:09:55,817 --> 01:09:56,860
Yeah.

1214
01:10:00,488 --> 01:10:01,615
Something wrong?

1215
01:10:03,700 --> 01:10:05,619
Just a little surprised, that's all.

1216
01:10:07,704 --> 01:10:08,830
Why?

1217
01:10:08,914 --> 01:10:10,790
Because of the way he treated you.

1218
01:10:12,542 --> 01:10:14,127
What do you mean?

1219
01:10:14,210 --> 01:10:18,298
My heart feels like
it's been torn out of my chest,

1220
01:10:18,381 --> 01:10:21,343
thrown on the floor and stomped on.

1221
01:10:21,426 --> 01:10:23,053
[Jason] Ring any bells?

1222
01:10:24,346 --> 01:10:26,264
You're the one who said
someone would come along

1223
01:10:26,348 --> 01:10:27,432
and treat me right.

1224
01:10:28,016 --> 01:10:30,226
I know, but this guy?

1225
01:10:31,895 --> 01:10:33,813
Wait, don't you want me to be happy?

1226
01:10:36,650 --> 01:10:37,859
Very much.

1227
01:10:40,987 --> 01:10:44,491
I think there's something real here,

1228
01:10:44,574 --> 01:10:46,076
between you and me.

1229
01:10:53,458 --> 01:10:55,043
What if it's too late?

1230
01:11:00,840 --> 01:11:02,717
I think we should meet.

1231
01:11:09,891 --> 01:11:11,893
I need to think about this.

1232
01:11:18,191 --> 01:11:19,192
Good night.

1233
01:11:21,444 --> 01:11:22,696
Good night, Parker.

[folk song continues]

1239
01:12:09,784 --> 01:12:13,121
Goodwin Wines isn't just about wine.

1240
01:12:13,204 --> 01:12:17,667
Goodwin Wines is about
more than just wine.

1241
01:12:17,751 --> 01:12:20,879
Okay, I want to talk about family.

1242
01:12:20,962 --> 01:12:22,505
No, no. Um...

1243
01:12:22,589 --> 01:12:24,591
Let's talk about family.

1244
01:12:26,801 --> 01:12:30,430
Classic wine doesn't mean
you can't have new customers.

1245
01:12:31,514 --> 01:12:35,143
Classic wine doesn't mean
you can't have new customers.

1246
01:12:36,728 --> 01:12:38,021
Classic wine...

1247
01:12:40,065 --> 01:12:41,775
doesn't mean you can't have new customers.

1248

[folk song continues]

1249
01:13:00,001 --> 01:13:01,419
Hey.

1250
01:13:01,503 --> 01:13:03,421
How'd it go last night?

1251
01:13:03,505 --> 01:13:05,173
Uh, with Perry.

1252
01:13:05,256 --> 01:13:07,884
Oh, right. Uh, Perry.
Uh, it's fine.

1253
01:13:07,967 --> 01:13:10,095
I knew he would come around eventually.

1254
01:13:10,178 --> 01:13:12,138
You're just too good to pass up.

1255
01:13:12,222 --> 01:13:13,223
Right.

1256
01:13:14,474 --> 01:13:16,017
What's wrong?

1257
01:13:17,852 --> 01:13:19,479
- It's Him.
- Oh.

1258
01:13:19,562 --> 01:13:21,082
You know, the guy I've been texting with.

1259
01:13:21,106 --> 01:13:22,899
I told Him I went out
with Perry last night,

1260
01:13:22,982 --> 01:13:25,985
and I don't know,
he got all weird about it.

1261
01:13:26,069 --> 01:13:27,529
I feel bad.

1262
01:13:27,612 --> 01:13:29,280
Because you wish it was Him.

1263
01:13:30,281 --> 01:13:31,699
You need to decide what you want.

1264
01:13:31,783 --> 01:13:33,703
A longtime boyfriend
who wants to take next step,

1265
01:13:33,785 --> 01:13:35,537
or some guy you messaged by mistake,

1266
01:13:35,620 --> 01:13:37,163
who you may never actually meet.

1267
01:13:37,247 --> 01:13:40,750
I mean, you two are definitely
made for each other.

1268
01:13:42,293 --> 01:13:45,421
[indistinct chatter and laughter]

1269
01:14:01,729 --> 01:14:02,730
Hey.

1270
01:14:05,608 --> 01:14:06,818
Hey.

1271
01:14:06,901 --> 01:14:08,736
There's something I wanted to say.

1272
01:14:10,071 --> 01:14:11,072
Yeah.

1273
01:14:12,740 --> 01:14:13,741
Good luck.

1274
01:14:16,077 --> 01:14:19,372
Oh. Oh, yeah, yeah.
Good luck to you too.

1275
01:14:22,709 --> 01:14:25,295
Okay, okay, what is going on?

1276
01:14:27,589 --> 01:14:30,216
With... what exactly?

1277
01:14:30,300 --> 01:14:32,343
Well, you just haven't been
acting like yourself.

1278
01:14:33,678 --> 01:14:35,698
Isn't that a good thing,
considering how you feel about me?

1279
01:14:35,722 --> 01:14:37,515
Okay, first you call truce,

1280
01:14:37,599 --> 01:14:39,827
then you don't park in my spot
for the first time in weeks,

1281
01:14:39,851 --> 01:14:42,746
but then I see you getting all buddy-buddy
with Craig right before our pitches.

1282
01:14:42,770 --> 01:14:43,890
It's not what it looks like.

1283
01:14:43,938 --> 01:14:46,065
- Yeah, go ahead, deny it.
- Look...

1284
01:14:46,149 --> 01:14:47,901
there's something that you need to know.

1285
01:14:47,984 --> 01:14:49,736
You don't think I know
what you're doing?

1286
01:14:49,819 --> 01:14:51,505
You're trying to get my head,
and it's not gonna work.

1287
01:14:51,529 --> 01:14:53,072
- If you'd just let me finish.
- No!

1288
01:14:53,156 --> 01:14:55,575
I'm not gonna let you trip me up.

1289
01:14:55,658 --> 01:14:57,160
You know what, Crawford?

1290
01:14:57,243 --> 01:14:59,162
No matter how this pitch goes today,

1291
01:14:59,245 --> 01:15:01,956
when this is all done,
I never wanna talk to you again.

1292
01:15:23,645 --> 01:15:25,772
[Debra] So, if you look here...

1293
01:15:25,855 --> 01:15:27,565
[Craig] Mm-hmm, yeah.

1294
01:15:27,649 --> 01:15:30,109
- I wanna show you...
- Yes.

1295
01:15:30,193 --> 01:15:33,238
Okay, who wants to go first?

1296
01:15:33,321 --> 01:15:35,198
I think Alexa should go first.

1297
01:15:36,532 --> 01:15:38,034
Alexa?

1298
01:15:38,117 --> 01:15:39,118
- Yeah.
- Great.

1299
01:15:44,290 --> 01:15:47,043
And finally, I want to talk about family.

1300
01:15:47,126 --> 01:15:49,045
Your father would be so proud

1301
01:15:49,128 --> 01:15:51,130
with how you've grown this business.

1302
01:15:51,214 --> 01:15:53,633
As someone once said,
there's a little bit of his spirit

1303
01:15:53,716 --> 01:15:55,218
in every bottle of Goodwin wine.

1304
01:15:55,301 --> 01:15:59,681
And I want the consumer
to connect with that spirit.

1305
01:15:59,764 --> 01:16:02,976
When you're invited to someone's house
for dinner, what do you bring?

1306
01:16:03,059 --> 01:16:05,019
A nice bottle of wine.

1307
01:16:05,103 --> 01:16:08,898
When you go to your best friend's house
for a nice quiet evening,

1308
01:16:08,982 --> 01:16:10,692
what do you bring?

1309
01:16:10,775 --> 01:16:12,944
A nice bottle of wine

1310
01:16:13,027 --> 01:16:17,240
because you need that special
touch only wine can provide,

1311
01:16:17,323 --> 01:16:19,033
because Goodwin wine...

1312
01:16:23,663 --> 01:16:25,623
is good for the heart.

1313
01:16:27,458 --> 01:16:29,460
Thank you for that, Alexa.

1314
01:16:32,964 --> 01:16:35,508
That's a tough act to follow.

1315
01:16:35,591 --> 01:16:36,926
Yeah.

1316
01:16:38,553 --> 01:16:39,679
[Craig] Good.

1317
01:16:46,894 --> 01:16:49,814
I was gonna come up here
and do my thing.

1318
01:16:49,897 --> 01:16:52,817
You know, talk fast,

1319
01:16:52,900 --> 01:16:55,570
throw around a bunch of
empty words like "value,"

1320
01:16:55,653 --> 01:16:58,865
"advantage," "demographics."

1321
01:16:58,948 --> 01:17:03,286
But although it looks like
I'm in complete control...

1322
01:17:05,038 --> 01:17:06,497
I'm not.

1323
01:17:08,916 --> 01:17:10,168
[whispers]
What are you doing?

1324
01:17:10,251 --> 01:17:11,627
I've always said that

1325
01:17:11,711 --> 01:17:15,131
thinking you can be in control of anything
is nothing but a pipe dream.

1326
01:17:17,258 --> 01:17:20,178
After all, Allen Saunders famously said,

1327
01:17:20,261 --> 01:17:24,474
"Life is what happens
while you're busy making other plans."

1328
01:17:28,311 --> 01:17:30,313
What if Allen Saunders was wrong?

1329
01:17:32,190 --> 01:17:35,777
Maybe it's not just about
living in the moment.

1330
01:17:38,488 --> 01:17:39,781
Maybe you need to be invested.

1331
01:17:42,200 --> 01:17:43,659
Like her.

1332
01:17:45,411 --> 01:17:46,579
She's smart,

1333
01:17:47,163 --> 01:17:48,373
driven...

1334
01:17:49,957 --> 01:17:51,501
organized,

1335
01:17:51,584 --> 01:17:53,086
meticulous.

1336
01:17:55,671 --> 01:17:58,132
You'd be fortunate
to have her on your team.

1337
01:18:01,219 --> 01:18:02,387
I'm confused.

1338
01:18:04,889 --> 01:18:08,142
When you saw me talking
to Craig this morning...

1339
01:18:09,227 --> 01:18:11,604
I was telling him he'd be a fool
not to go with you.

1340
01:18:15,316 --> 01:18:16,442
That's true.

1341
01:18:19,612 --> 01:18:20,613
So...

1342
01:18:22,448 --> 01:18:23,699
congratulations.

1343
01:18:36,421 --> 01:18:38,673
I really like that young man.

1344
01:18:50,768 --> 01:18:54,647
I have no idea
what just happened in there,

1345
01:18:54,730 --> 01:18:58,401
but what you did was really special.

1346
01:18:59,777 --> 01:19:02,405
Yeah, well, she's better than me.

1347
01:19:02,488 --> 01:19:04,031
She deserves it.

1348
01:19:04,115 --> 01:19:06,993
Do you remember what I told you
in that first meeting?

1349
01:19:07,076 --> 01:19:08,661
[chuckles]

1350
01:19:08,744 --> 01:19:10,663
Yeah, that we bicker like your parents.

1351
01:19:10,746 --> 01:19:13,624
[laughs]
And that your competitive nature

1352
01:19:13,708 --> 01:19:16,210
brings out the best in both of you.

1353
01:19:16,294 --> 01:19:19,422
I couldn't have chosen
one of you over the other.

1354
01:19:20,506 --> 01:19:23,092
But together,
I knew you'd make magic.

1355
01:19:24,177 --> 01:19:25,970
And what I just saw in there proves it.

1356
01:19:26,053 --> 01:19:28,306
You guys are gonna make a great team.

1357
01:19:29,682 --> 01:19:31,392
I'm not sure Alexa would agree with that.

1358
01:19:31,476 --> 01:19:33,853
Maybe, maybe not.

1359
01:19:35,563 --> 01:19:38,149
Congratulations, co-director.

1360
01:19:39,275 --> 01:19:40,860
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

1364
01:20:47,218 --> 01:20:49,136
Can we talk about this?

1365
01:20:58,688 --> 01:21:00,106
I'm sorry.

1366
01:21:01,649 --> 01:21:05,570
But I'm not sorry it turned out to be you
on the other end of this.

1367
01:21:08,739 --> 01:21:10,241
I miss you.

I can't believe you're Him.

1372
01:22:22,104 --> 01:22:23,731
Yeah.

1373
01:22:23,814 --> 01:22:25,232
I didn't see that coming either.

1374
01:22:25,316 --> 01:22:28,694
A few weeks ago, a few days ago,

1375
01:22:28,778 --> 01:22:31,489
I'm pretty sure I hated you.

1376
01:22:33,532 --> 01:22:35,743
Yeah. We just didn't know each other.

1377
01:22:36,327 --> 01:22:38,162
But now we do?

1378
01:22:40,539 --> 01:22:41,999
Look, I have questions.

1379
01:22:43,417 --> 01:22:44,460
Okay.

1380
01:22:44,543 --> 01:22:47,797
Like... how long have you known?

1381
01:22:50,132 --> 01:22:53,636
Uh, I figured it out a couple days ago.

1382
01:22:53,719 --> 01:22:55,721
Trey told me the numbers were sequential.

1383
01:22:56,722 --> 01:22:57,949
I asked Brad for Hannah's number

1384
01:22:57,973 --> 01:23:01,143
and saw that it was
the exact same as mine...

1385
01:23:01,227 --> 01:23:02,621
- ...except for the last two numbers.
- The last two numbers.

1386
01:23:02,645 --> 01:23:03,938
Well, aren't you clever.

1387
01:23:04,980 --> 01:23:07,149
No. If I was clever...

1388
01:23:09,235 --> 01:23:10,778
I would have seen it a long time ago.

1389
01:23:10,861 --> 01:23:12,279
Would have seen what?

1390
01:23:14,782 --> 01:23:16,200
That I love you.

1391
01:23:17,952 --> 01:23:18,953
You what?

1392
01:23:20,121 --> 01:23:21,372
You heard me.

1393
01:23:22,790 --> 01:23:28,295
I mean, what happened to no names,
no work talk, no reason to lie?

1394
01:23:32,216 --> 01:23:33,718
I made other plans.

1395
01:23:37,430 --> 01:23:38,931
Well, then say it again.

1396
01:23:40,725 --> 01:23:42,643
[sighs]
I love you.

1397
01:23:43,436 --> 01:23:45,229
Do you love me...

1398
01:23:56,490 --> 01:23:59,785
We should probably
get to work now, co-director.

1399
01:23:59,869 --> 01:24:03,330
Oh, look at this.
It's gone to her head already.

1400
01:24:03,414 --> 01:24:05,559
I'm just glad I was around so
you could ride on my coattails.

1401
01:24:05,583 --> 01:24:08,127
And another thing: We need to talk
about the parking situation.

1402
01:24:08,210 --> 01:24:10,129
Just because you're upwardly mobile now
