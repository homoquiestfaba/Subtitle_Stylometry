106 point 9 F.M. K.O.C.K. The Rooster.
Home of the Kock Block.

2
00:00:34,067 --> 00:00:36,001
You don't want to get Kock Blocked - or do you?

3
00:00:36,036 --> 00:00:39,437
We've got Van Halen and Judas Priest
Kock Blocks happening all day long.

4
00:00:39,506 --> 00:00:42,675
We've got two guys coming in here
and these fellas collect frozen entrees.

5
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:44,609
Whoa! You meanTV Dinners?

6
00:00:44,644 --> 00:00:47,442
Yes! They collect frozen dinners
of some sort. I don't know.

7
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:49,878
These guys are absolutely nuts!
They're gonna be in here.

8
00:00:49,949 --> 00:00:52,884
It's gonna be great!
All morning long - I 06 point 9...

9
00:00:52,919 --> 00:00:56,650
Stan and Dan in the morning on
The Rooster K.O.C.K. The Kock!

10
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:05,020
<i>(Intro song: "Pink Dress" by The Piersons)</i>

11
00:01:55,081 --> 00:01:59,853
<i>That was a Kock Block
on a Classic Kock Block Friday.</i>

12
00:01:59,888 --> 00:02:01,653
<i>Coming in right now - two crazy fellas...</i>

13
00:02:01,688 --> 00:02:05,525
Now these guys are nutty.
They collect frozen food entrees.

14
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:06,558
I gotta hear this.

15
00:02:06,593 --> 00:02:09,662
Shawn andVince -Welcome to the show
gentlemen but before we do any talking...

16
00:02:09,697 --> 00:02:10,856
...go ahead and put on your Kock Heads.

17
00:02:10,930 --> 00:02:12,964
<i>Nothing better onthe radio than funny hats.</i>

18
00:02:12,999 --> 00:02:17,103
<i>That's right my friend. Funny hats in
the morning! Stan and Dan l06 point 9...</i>

19
00:02:17,138 --> 00:02:21,441
<i>Put on the gobbler! Yeah! You got balls on your chin!</i>

20
00:02:21,476 --> 00:02:23,927
Whoa! Here comes another
meeting with the boss!

21
00:02:23,962 --> 00:02:26,344
Hey! They looked good on Styx
and those guys blow!

22
00:02:26,379 --> 00:02:29,682
So you guys collect frozen food entrees.
That's very interesting.

23
00:02:29,717 --> 00:02:32,879
WHY!? WHY!? FIRST QUESTION -WHY!?

24
00:02:32,952 --> 00:02:35,338
<i>Well we're frozen enthusiasts...</i>

25
00:02:35,373 --> 00:02:37,689
...and we collect frozen entrees.

26
00:02:37,724 --> 00:02:41,528
<i>How do you know when you're done!? HA HA HA!</i>

27
00:02:41,563 --> 00:02:42,460
That's funny.

28
00:02:42,495 --> 00:02:45,865
Yeah, it's pretty good.
Listen, when you guys collect...

29
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:49,002
...Is there any particular
one that you collect?

30
00:02:49,037 --> 00:02:51,436
What's the most expensive one?

31
00:02:51,471 --> 00:02:54,874
Yeah, what's the Babe Ruth
of frozen entrees?

32
00:02:54,909 --> 00:02:56,910
Yeah, what's the most expensive?

33
00:02:56,945 --> 00:02:58,444
What's your Sammy Sosa!?

34
00:02:58,479 --> 00:02:59,811
Well, it's the...

35
00:02:59,846 --> 00:03:01,880
<i>I understand you guys have a club.</i>

36
00:03:01,915 --> 00:03:04,884
- It's the... - Yeah, the Mesa Frozen Entree
Enthusiast Club. We have...

37
00:03:04,919 --> 00:03:07,287
What's the matter, the pussy
catchers club was all filled up!?

38
00:03:07,322 --> 00:03:09,621
Here we go! More memos!

39
00:03:09,656 --> 00:03:12,659
Hey ladies, get the runoff over at
the frozen food enthusiasts club.

40
00:03:12,694 --> 00:03:14,494
Too long of a name for a club!

41
00:03:14,529 --> 00:03:15,193
<i>We have...</i>

42
00:03:15,228 --> 00:03:17,864
I understand you guys
are having a convention.

43
00:03:17,899 --> 00:03:20,064
We have a convention coming...

44
00:03:20,099 --> 00:03:24,170
<i>FELLAS! We're running out of time! We can check
you out on the web at frozenfood.com I imagine.</i>

45
00:03:24,205 --> 00:03:25,672
<i>It's w.w.w. Dot...</i>

46
00:03:25,707 --> 00:03:27,372
Fantastic!

47
00:03:27,407 --> 00:03:29,674
Really enjoyed meeting you guys!

48
00:03:29,709 --> 00:03:31,309
K.O.C.K. Stan and Dan in the morning.

49
00:03:31,344 --> 00:03:35,110
Come back, we're going to make
a prank phone call to Jessica Hahn.

50
00:03:36,516 --> 00:03:39,551
<i>Collecting in general is like a tatoo...</i>

51
00:03:39,586 --> 00:03:44,324
...or potato chips.
People become very gluttonous for things.

52
00:03:44,359 --> 00:03:47,091
It's coveting. You covet something.

53
00:03:47,126 --> 00:03:50,797
<i>You get the first one, then you go on to
the second one and then the third one.</i>

54
00:03:50,832 --> 00:03:55,168
<i>So, who knows? Maybe this could
become a highly collectable thing.</i>

55
00:03:55,203 --> 00:03:57,659
I mean, stranger things have happened.

56
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:04,071
<i>Collecting is no different than managing
people, building a strong corporate team...</i>

57
00:04:04,106 --> 00:04:08,703
<i>You have to have vision, you have to have
discipline and you have to have resources.</i>

58
00:04:09,482 --> 00:04:13,384
I've got several original Scutters...
a lot of money.

59
00:04:16,356 --> 00:04:18,323
I have tons of Successories.

60
00:04:18,358 --> 00:04:22,128
<i>I read one or two a day.
They really get me motivated.</i>

61
00:04:22,163 --> 00:04:26,462
<i>I have literally every single one ever made.</i>

62
00:04:26,599 --> 00:04:28,866
Being a firefighter and a collector is quite symbiotic.

63
00:04:28,901 --> 00:04:33,271
After a big fire, when we do what
we call Salvage & Overhaul...

64
00:04:33,306 --> 00:04:37,777
I'm able to root through quite a bit of
rubble and find some treasures occasionally.

65
00:04:37,812 --> 00:04:40,813
<i>(filmmaker) Isn't it illegal to remove
something from the scene of a fire?</i>

66
00:04:40,848 --> 00:04:44,150
Oh no! Well actually maybe.
But we all do it.

67
00:04:44,185 --> 00:04:46,084
Yeah, I've done it before.

68
00:04:46,119 --> 00:04:51,791
People are just so thankful for what we
do, they expect us to take a few things I guess.

69
00:04:51,826 --> 00:04:54,359
It's all insured anyway.

70
00:04:54,394 --> 00:04:57,662
<i>I have quite a collection of plates.</i>

71
00:04:57,697 --> 00:05:01,165
I have more plates than I do entrees at this point.

72
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:05,588
I'm very proud of them and I do display
them prominently in my home.

73
00:05:05,623 --> 00:05:09,976
This anniversary plate here, I got
down in the willow district area.

74
00:05:10,011 --> 00:05:13,845
A little house fire down there.
I'm very proud of it.

75
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:18,351
This next wood one here is aJungfrau.
It's from the Matterhorn region.

76
00:05:18,386 --> 00:05:21,286
It is an authentic Jungfrau.
It's not a reproduction.

77
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:25,258
A lot of people look at my collection
and think it is but it's not.

78
00:05:25,293 --> 00:05:29,195
I'm very proud of it. I got it down
at an antique store downtown.

79
00:05:29,230 --> 00:05:33,633
With the fire damage, it's still very valuable.

80
00:05:33,668 --> 00:05:35,700
The next one is my pride and joy.

81
00:05:35,735 --> 00:05:40,705
It's very valuablee to me, butalso on the open market.

82
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:44,093
This one I got down on eighth street.
It was a bungalow fire.

83
00:05:44,128 --> 00:05:47,447
It was actually quite savage and the fire was a-
blowin'.

84
00:05:47,482 --> 00:05:50,948
I was very fortunate to make it out alive.

85
00:05:50,983 --> 00:05:54,387
(filmmaker) What about the family? Didn't they
have any interest in getting those plates back?

86
00:05:54,422 --> 00:05:57,788
Oh, no. They burned to a crisp.

87
00:05:58,458 --> 00:06:03,225
But I was able to save the full
set so it wasn't a total loss.

88
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:07,158
Isn't it gorgeous?

89
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:13,840
You see, when you collect "entrees"
you don't collect pot pies.

90
00:06:13,875 --> 00:06:16,374
Turns out, that's not cool.

91
00:06:16,409 --> 00:06:18,995
So I'm always fucking with my buddy A here.

92
00:06:19,030 --> 00:06:21,581
Like, "Hey A, how's the pot pies, buddy!?"

93
00:06:21,616 --> 00:06:24,382
HOW'STHE POT PIES!? HA! HA! HA!

94
00:06:24,417 --> 00:06:27,320
I love it! It's hilarious! He gets super-ticked.

95
00:06:27,355 --> 00:06:28,685
He's such a pussy!

96
00:06:29,222 --> 00:06:31,189
HA! HA! I love it.

97
00:06:31,224 --> 00:06:34,892
In my collection now, I've got
over nine hundred pieces...

98
00:06:34,927 --> 00:06:39,966
<i>So just to hold them all, I've got to run fourteen
full-sized freezers in a one bedroom apartment.</i>

99
00:06:40,001 --> 00:06:43,468
This is a classic Frigidaire model
- the first freezer I ever owned.

100
00:06:43,503 --> 00:06:47,106
Got it for my twelfth birthday, had it
ever since. Never let me down once.

101
00:06:47,141 --> 00:06:49,542
All brass fittings underneath. Great unit.

102
00:06:49,577 --> 00:06:52,310
But these are my boys!

103
00:06:52,345 --> 00:06:56,247
Goose and Mav. Amazing units!

104
00:06:56,282 --> 00:07:01,154
Now this is a vintage... a classic '68
Sears Coldspot Space-Master l7.

105
00:07:01,189 --> 00:07:04,555
<i>Just an amazing unit.
Actually, this one has been hot-rodded.</i>

106
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:07,892
Twice the Freon capacity that it
was issued with back in sixty-eight.

107
00:07:07,927 --> 00:07:11,864
Gonna keep everything cold as fuck
and that one is heavy as shit, believe me.

108
00:07:11,899 --> 00:07:13,559
<i>But this one here...</i>

109
00:07:15,168 --> 00:07:20,128
Two-thousand two Kelvinator.
Cryogenic fuckin' cold.

110
00:07:20,273 --> 00:07:22,974
It runs at a hundred and twenty-five
watts per side at eight ohms.

111
00:07:23,009 --> 00:07:27,647
Tricked-out after market...
I can run this bitch at 500 watts all day long.

112
00:07:27,682 --> 00:07:30,181
450 PSI on the compressor.

113
00:07:30,216 --> 00:07:34,120
Air-tight, water-tight, submersible
up to three hundred and fifty feet.

114
00:07:34,155 --> 00:07:37,688
It's my best, flagship, top-of-the-line unit.

115
00:07:37,723 --> 00:07:40,758
<i>This is where I keep all my deluxe, gourmet entrees.</i>

116
00:07:40,793 --> 00:07:44,559
<i>This is where you're going to
find my grade-A premium shit!</i>

117
00:07:52,004 --> 00:07:55,274
<i>Shawn's brother's been staying with him
for a couple of weeks. He's in town.</i>

118
00:07:55,309 --> 00:07:57,175
<i>I'm really looking forward to meeting him.</i>

119
00:07:57,210 --> 00:08:03,479
He's deaf and I worked at a Christian camp
for deafs for like four summers in a row...

120
00:08:03,549 --> 00:08:05,574
...and they're all really nice.

121
00:08:05,651 --> 00:08:10,611
I think Shawn is just a really good
person for having a deaf brother.

122
00:08:10,890 --> 00:08:15,228
<i>(deaf accent) I want theJumbo Wings Nuclear...</i>

123
00:08:15,263 --> 00:08:19,630
...and Nachos supreme.

124
00:08:19,665 --> 00:08:22,634
Okay, we'll get that right out for you.

125
00:08:23,102 --> 00:08:26,906
Excuse me sir, Excuse me. Are you deaf?

126
00:08:26,941 --> 00:08:27,705
Uh, huh.

127
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:33,779
Good. My son is a Cub Scout and we're trying to
work on earning his Sign Language Badge.

128
00:08:33,814 --> 00:08:38,784
He could learn it from a book,
but I thought it would be more fulfilling...

129
00:08:38,819 --> 00:08:42,183
...if he could learn it from a real live deaf guy.

130
00:08:42,218 --> 00:08:45,547
If you wouldn't mind. Anything you can think of easy.

131
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:51,197
This means FuckYou.

132
00:08:51,232 --> 00:08:53,097
(milf gasps)

133
00:08:59,105 --> 00:09:02,973
<i>(pretty funny shit, eh deaf people?)</i>

134
00:09:03,109 --> 00:09:08,069
This here is my Stadium Pal.
Just lock that in place there...

135
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:11,751
Obviously, it's an external polyurethane bladder.

136
00:09:11,786 --> 00:09:12,984
I attach it to my leg.

137
00:09:13,019 --> 00:09:19,322
I use this to capture and store my urine until I'm
ready to deal with it on my own terms.

138
00:09:19,725 --> 00:09:22,026
<i>(filmmaker) Is that for medical reasons?</i>

139
00:09:22,061 --> 00:09:29,702
Oh, no. No, it's one of the many tools I use to
actually take control back in my life.

140
00:09:29,737 --> 00:09:33,440
If I'm driving, I'm driving.
If I'm doing chores, I'm doing chores.

141
00:09:33,475 --> 00:09:37,143
If I'm working - especially when I'm working.
I want to be working.

142
00:09:37,178 --> 00:09:40,912
I don't want to be going potty all the time.

143
00:09:40,947 --> 00:09:45,952
I'm there to teach people, as a safety and
efficiency consultant, how to be more efficient.

144
00:09:45,987 --> 00:09:50,556
<i>Okay? I'm there to focus.
To get in the zone, stay in the zone...</i>

145
00:09:50,591 --> 00:09:53,525
<i>...and focus on the task and job at hand.</i>

146
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:57,296
And that's how come I only sleep two hours
and forty minutes every night.

147
00:09:57,331 --> 00:10:01,000
Well, Heidi and I have been married for
about four and a half months now...

148
00:10:01,035 --> 00:10:02,733
...and we are newlyweds.

149
00:10:02,768 --> 00:10:07,205
People sometimes are surprised
to learn that we are a couple.

150
00:10:08,007 --> 00:10:14,380
And, yes, there was a period of my life
where I did experiment with homosexuality.

151
00:10:14,415 --> 00:10:18,566
It was from the age of thirteen 'til about...
six months ago.

152
00:10:18,601 --> 00:10:22,717
But that's when I met the good
folks at Ex-Gay Ministries.

153
00:10:22,788 --> 00:10:26,257
They opened up my eyes to the
fact that I am a sinner...

154
00:10:26,292 --> 00:10:31,764
...but I could be saved through a
strict regimen of prayer...

155
00:10:31,799 --> 00:10:34,494
...and self-loathing.

156
00:10:35,334 --> 00:10:39,293
Just about half full.
I'm gonna splash it with some olive oil.

157
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:46,045
<i>I'd only been on the wagon for about eighteen
days when Rafael introduced me to Heidi.</i>

158
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:49,113
<i>Rafael is my Ex-Gay sponsor.</i>

159
00:10:49,148 --> 00:10:54,153
She had just put a transmission in his new Mustang.
It's purple.

160
00:10:54,188 --> 00:10:56,387
He thought we'd have a lot in common and we do.

161
00:10:56,422 --> 00:11:00,459
We both like to go to the movies.
We both like to go out to dinner...

162
00:11:00,494 --> 00:11:06,864
...and we share a real desire to
avoid eternal damnation.

163
00:11:10,569 --> 00:11:14,674
Okay, we've got a shitload of shit to cover
tonight folks so let's get started, alright?

164
00:11:14,709 --> 00:11:18,711
Now, as everybody knows, the new
Swansons are coming out this Friday.

165
00:11:18,746 --> 00:11:22,113
<i>Yeah! (applause) Finally! I know!</i>

166
00:11:22,148 --> 00:11:25,883
<i>So, they're due to be released l2:0 I Friday morning.</i>

167
00:11:25,918 --> 00:11:30,923
I think I might be able to get my hands
on a few of them ahead of schedule...

168
00:11:30,958 --> 00:11:32,992
<i>...and have some in time for Thursday night's meeting.</i>

169
00:11:33,027 --> 00:11:35,393
<i>I've got a hook-up on the inside at Safeway.</i>

170
00:11:35,428 --> 00:11:38,330
I'm going to do my best but
that's all I can say about that.

171
00:11:38,365 --> 00:11:40,631
What about the rumors
about the Russian Dumplings?

172
00:11:40,666 --> 00:11:45,671
Yeah, I've heard those rumors myself and,
to be honest, I think it's fuckin' bullshit.

173
00:11:45,706 --> 00:11:47,538
I don't think we're gonna see those this year.

174
00:11:47,573 --> 00:11:50,940
It would be great for the collectors
but I really doubt it.

175
00:11:51,010 --> 00:11:53,679
<i>Scott buddy, I know what you're looking for.</i>

176
00:11:53,714 --> 00:11:54,612
The Kiwi Cobbler?

177
00:11:54,647 --> 00:11:57,882
<i>I don't know. Fifty, fifty. That's the best I can tell you.
Keep your fingers crossed.</i>

178
00:11:57,917 --> 00:12:03,089
Just thinkgoodthoughts. Maybe we'll get them, if not
this season, probably next season for sure.

179
00:12:03,124 --> 00:12:06,590
But the big news - last minute
change in the packaging.

180
00:12:06,625 --> 00:12:09,995
They were a little concerned about a conflict
with the Healthy Choice entrees.

181
00:12:10,030 --> 00:12:13,966
<i>They're going with red this year.
(excited chatter)</i>

182
00:12:14,001 --> 00:12:15,232
Red?

183
00:12:15,267 --> 00:12:17,035
<i>They're gonna be real sexy.</i>

184
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:18,804
<i>Shawn, are you sure red?</i>

185
00:12:18,839 --> 00:12:20,171
Yeah, I'm sure.

186
00:12:20,206 --> 00:12:22,108
<i>My people said they were gonna be blue.</i>

187
00:12:22,143 --> 00:12:25,976
<i>Well, your people are wrong.</i>

188
00:12:26,045 --> 00:12:27,878
NBT is the key to the whole thing.

189
00:12:27,913 --> 00:12:31,508
That's what makes frozen entree collecting
so fun and so exciting for me.

190
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:38,691
TV Dinners have been around since the fifties,
whereas entree collecting is a relatively new thing.

191
00:12:38,726 --> 00:12:42,762
So, you need to be very creative
when locating new pieces.

192
00:12:42,797 --> 00:12:46,764
<i>This one... I was in the freezer
aisle at Safeway one day.</i>

193
00:12:46,799 --> 00:12:51,437
Met another guy there that was a collector. You
know, one of these guys - big shit-talker.

194
00:12:51,472 --> 00:12:55,074
Thinks he knows everything. Well, I think
we found out how much he knew.

195
00:12:55,109 --> 00:12:58,642
Sold me this piece for nineteen bucks.
Just broke it off in his ass.

196
00:12:58,677 --> 00:13:03,512
This fucker, today, is worth over four hundred
dollars and I just got it like three years ago.

197
00:13:03,582 --> 00:13:07,620
This is a beauty. The oldest piece
in my collection. L959 Stouffer's.

198
00:13:07,655 --> 00:13:10,154
This is like the Mickey Mantle rookie card.

199
00:13:10,189 --> 00:13:16,260
And you might remember the
Kiss Solo Meals that they issued.

200
00:13:16,295 --> 00:13:21,416
These things are really hard to find today.
And look at this - Gene Simmons.

201
00:13:21,451 --> 00:13:26,538
This is just a beauty. It's in premium shape.
I mean this thing is mint.

202
00:13:26,906 --> 00:13:28,839
<i>Okay, we've got a lot of out of town collectors...</i>

203
00:13:28,874 --> 00:13:32,077
...that are real interested in the convention.
We gotta keep tabs on these fuckers.

204
00:13:32,112 --> 00:13:36,448
So, with that in mind, let's hear
from Shelly, our I.T. Officer.

205
00:13:36,483 --> 00:13:38,983
<i>(weak applause)</i>

206
00:13:39,018 --> 00:13:44,115
<i>Everyone was kind of down because nobody wanted to
step up to the plate and make the web site.</i>

207
00:13:44,356 --> 00:13:46,390
<i>So, I got pretty into it.</i>

208
00:13:46,425 --> 00:13:48,125
I was like, "I could learn this."

209
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:52,932
So I went and I took a whole three week
course at M.C.C. And it was great.

210
00:13:52,967 --> 00:13:55,766
<i>So we have like, stuff about news.
We have a photo gallery.</i>

211
00:13:55,801 --> 00:13:59,872
<i>You can buy and sell entrees on the site here -
we've got a section for that.</i>

212
00:13:59,907 --> 00:14:03,641
One day, I overheard Shawn talking
to one of the other members...

213
00:14:03,676 --> 00:14:08,914
...and he was kind of bragging about it.
So, I think people really like it.

214
00:14:08,949 --> 00:14:13,374
It feels really good. Especially that
Shawn likes it, of course.

215
00:14:13,452 --> 00:14:18,856
<i>I used to spend my Saturday nights just
kind of... I wasted a lot of time reading.</i>

216
00:14:19,592 --> 00:14:25,588
<i>Now, of course, I'm on the internet a lot. I guess
you could say it's expanded my personal life.</i>

217
00:14:25,898 --> 00:14:29,735
'Cause I've met people. You know, people
have approached me on-line...

218
00:14:29,770 --> 00:14:32,269
<i>...and you kind of start chatting with them.</i>

219
00:14:32,304 --> 00:14:38,043
I think if Shawn had met someone on-line
instead of in a bar, he might be happier.

220
00:14:38,078 --> 00:14:41,313
...He might have found someone who
appreciates him more.

221
00:14:41,348 --> 00:14:43,981
<i>He's just really complicated.</i>

222
00:14:44,016 --> 00:14:47,386
<i>Okay, on the topic of the new membership
drive - one more thing.</i>

223
00:14:47,421 --> 00:14:50,054
I really don't want to bring it up again, but I have to.

224
00:14:50,089 --> 00:14:54,692
<i>Hazing. The hazing of the new members
has got to stop. (laughing & snickering)</i>

225
00:14:54,727 --> 00:14:59,926
<i>Look, I think it's funny too! I do! Most of
that shit was my idea, don't forget.</i>

226
00:15:00,065 --> 00:15:03,819
But if we want to be taken seriously
as a legitimate organization...

227
00:15:03,854 --> 00:15:07,538
...we've got to cut out these shenanigans
and get some black guys.

228
00:15:07,573 --> 00:15:11,475
<i>Can we seriously start talking about
the keynote speaker for the convention?</i>

229
00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:17,049
Well, we don't really have a lot of time left and
we still gotta get to games and refreshments.

230
00:15:17,084 --> 00:15:19,617
I think we should talk about it a little bit.

231
00:15:19,652 --> 00:15:24,056
Okay! Vince want's to talk about the keynote and
Vince always gets what he wants - doesn't he.

232
00:15:24,091 --> 00:15:26,290
So let's get into that. Okay...

233
00:15:26,325 --> 00:15:29,595
What if I can get DuChamp? (excited chatter)

234
00:15:29,630 --> 00:15:32,315
Okay, you can't. Anyway...

235
00:15:32,350 --> 00:15:34,965
<i>What if I can get him?</i>

236
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,836
Listen Vince, don't you think
he wasn't my first choice?

237
00:15:37,871 --> 00:15:40,673
They guy's my fuckin' hero.
I mean, he's the brass shit.

238
00:15:42,141 --> 00:15:47,646
What I hold in my hand right here is the
holy grail of frozen entree collecting...

239
00:15:47,681 --> 00:15:53,118
...and it's known, simply, as the
DuChamp Hungry Man.

240
00:15:53,153 --> 00:15:54,818
Back in the late sixties, early seventies.

241
00:15:54,853 --> 00:15:58,222
A package designer was working for Swanson
by the name ofTeddy DuChamp.

242
00:15:58,257 --> 00:16:02,394
Only here's the thing, he's not really a
package designer at all. He's an artist.

243
00:16:02,429 --> 00:16:05,195
The guy fuckin' hangs out withWarhol.
They're like friends.

244
00:16:05,230 --> 00:16:11,470
So he goes to unveil his new design for the
l972 Hungry Man line - and here's what it is...

245
00:16:11,505 --> 00:16:15,272
Awhite box with a picture of a
fuckin' spark plug on it.

246
00:16:15,307 --> 00:16:21,412
No text, no fuckin' UPC code. Nothing.
No bullshit. Just art! Okay?

247
00:16:21,447 --> 00:16:24,650
But these guys they don't fuckin' get it, right?
'Cause they're... You know...

248
00:16:24,685 --> 00:16:25,716
They're not into that shit.

249
00:16:25,751 --> 00:16:29,688
So they send him back to his drawing
board and say give us the usual bullshit...

250
00:16:29,723 --> 00:16:32,558
...that you crank out year after year.
And he's like, fuck that!

251
00:16:32,593 --> 00:16:36,560
So, here's what he comes back with.
How awesome is this?

252
00:16:36,595 --> 00:16:43,068
Okay, "Salisbury Steak, Mashed Potatoes and
Roll of Quarters." Right there!

253
00:16:43,103 --> 00:16:47,723
And then he sends us a message over here,
"Help, I hate my job."

254
00:16:47,758 --> 00:16:52,309
Cost him his job.
Made him a fuckin' legend in the industry.

255
00:16:52,344 --> 00:16:58,280
So, I know what you're thinking -
if this thing's worth so much, and it is...

256
00:16:58,315 --> 00:17:04,216
...then what the fuck are you doing just
keeping it in your regular freezer?

257
00:17:04,923 --> 00:17:07,224
Well, here's the thing.

258
00:17:07,259 --> 00:17:11,295
You break into my house, looking for
the DuChamp. Where you gonna look?

259
00:17:11,330 --> 00:17:15,299
You're gonna look in the Kelvinator 2000,you're
gonna look in all these kick-ass freezers...

260
00:17:15,334 --> 00:17:21,398
...but you're gonna be thinking,"what kind of a
fuckin' retard would keep it in his regular freezer?"

261
00:17:23,108 --> 00:17:27,279
<i>Next week's meeting, don't forget - not going to be here.
We're going to have it over at the No Choice.</i>

262
00:17:27,314 --> 00:17:32,284
Anybody who can stick around afterwards, that
would be great because my band is playing.

263
00:17:32,319 --> 00:17:34,251
Yup, me and Al.

264
00:17:34,286 --> 00:17:37,489
<i>It's kind of a big night for us because
we've got a record label scout...</i>

265
00:17:37,524 --> 00:17:39,691
<i>...from Holy-Trinity Records whose
gonna be at the show.</i>

266
00:17:39,726 --> 00:17:42,428
<i>(excited chatter)
I know! We're really fired up.</i>

267
00:17:42,463 --> 00:17:44,995
<i>So, anybody who can stay...</i>

268
00:17:45,030 --> 00:17:48,033
...just leave after the meeting and come
back in and pay the cover charge...

269
00:17:48,068 --> 00:17:49,833
...'cause we get that money.

270
00:17:49,868 --> 00:17:52,169
Aright, good meeting everybody! Nice!

271
00:17:52,204 --> 00:17:58,143
Anybody who want's to challenge my high score on
the dance game, Dr. Howard has the sign-up sheet!

272
00:17:58,444 --> 00:18:19,527
(music thumping)

273
00:18:19,598 --> 00:18:23,233
Threatened? Yeah, you have this nice
collection...

274
00:18:23,268 --> 00:18:26,738
...you've built in a short amount of
time and he takes this really seriously.

275
00:18:26,773 --> 00:18:28,605
That's crazy. My collection isn't shit.

276
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:32,576
His is way better than mine.
He has the DuChamp and it's NBT.

277
00:18:32,611 --> 00:18:40,085
Yeah, I just think it's the fact that he's a
dental hygienist and you drive a Porsche.

278
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:42,883
You know? Your car is super cool.

279
00:18:44,490 --> 00:18:47,091
You wanna go sit in it?

280
00:18:47,126 --> 00:18:53,395
Macaroni & cheese? You can't go wrong with
macaroni & cheese, my friend. That goes with every dinner!

281
00:18:54,299 --> 00:18:58,937
Whatcha got there? Lynda McCartney? She's dead.
That's worth something. Aright! Here we go!

282
00:18:58,972 --> 00:19:01,206
Hey Scottie, checking out the Ergo-Knob, huh?

283
00:19:01,241 --> 00:19:02,773
Yeah, why's it pointed down?

284
00:19:02,808 --> 00:19:04,274
Oh. Let me explain. It's very simple.

285
00:19:04,309 --> 00:19:07,711
When you normally grab a doorknob, you
don't even think about what you're doing.

286
00:19:07,746 --> 00:19:11,850
But what it's doing is actually causing a lot of
undue stress and strain on your ligaments...

287
00:19:11,885 --> 00:19:13,652
...because your fingers aren't pointed at the right
angle.

288
00:19:13,687 --> 00:19:16,286
Now, with the Ergo-Knob, watch this - Boom!

289
00:19:16,321 --> 00:19:19,992
Your fingers are in the perfect position and
it's not going to put that stress and strain.

290
00:19:20,027 --> 00:19:23,008
No carpel tunnel, no bursitis; you're set.

291
00:19:23,043 --> 00:19:25,989
So, you still living up
by Camelback?

292
00:19:26,231 --> 00:19:30,100
No, I'm actually living
with my folks now.

293
00:19:30,135 --> 00:19:33,739
Oh, well that's got to be nice.
I'm sure they enjoy seeing you...

294
00:19:33,774 --> 00:19:37,543
And you've got to be saving some money...

295
00:19:37,578 --> 00:19:39,409
How long you been there?

296
00:19:39,444 --> 00:19:42,247
Uh, my folks... um. A couple... a couple years now.

297
00:19:42,282 --> 00:19:43,942
Ooohh.

298
00:19:44,049 --> 00:19:46,049
Think about it; doors everywhere...

299
00:19:46,084 --> 00:19:48,554
You don't like strain and stress
on your elbows, do you?

300
00:19:48,589 --> 00:19:49,453
No.

301
00:19:49,488 --> 00:19:50,789
I'll tell the guys at work.

302
00:19:50,824 --> 00:19:52,055
<i>At the fire station?</i>

303
00:19:52,090 --> 00:19:55,861
No. I bartend two nights a week at
the Man Hole over onThird...

304
00:19:55,896 --> 00:19:59,558
They've got a bunch of doors.
Nine, ten, maybe a dozen.

305
00:19:59,865 --> 00:20:01,856
Yeah.

306
00:20:02,301 --> 00:20:04,002
<i>Now, are they out at Saddlebag Gardens?</i>

307
00:20:04,037 --> 00:20:04,832
Yes.

308
00:20:04,903 --> 00:20:09,975
Now, help me out - it that a real town or is
that more of a private retirement community?

309
00:20:10,010 --> 00:20:12,176
<i>It's a retirement community.</i>

310
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:15,326
Now, does that mean they allow cars?

311
00:20:15,361 --> 00:20:18,442
Uh... No, no. It's just the golf carts.

312
00:20:19,818 --> 00:20:21,217
Oh.

313
00:20:29,194 --> 00:20:32,563
<i>Al is the newest member of the
Scottsdale Klown Kutz family.</i>

314
00:20:32,598 --> 00:20:37,797
<i>He's growing into his role as a stylist and,
more importantly, as what we call a Smilist</i>

315
00:20:38,136 --> 00:20:41,506
<i>Al and I have only clashed on one thing
since he's been here. It's been make-up.</i>

316
00:20:41,541 --> 00:20:44,407
<i>It's important to us. We're a chain.
We've got standards.</i>

317
00:20:45,177 --> 00:20:48,580
So, we just got the new Q4 insert for
our corporate guidelines for face painting.

318
00:20:48,615 --> 00:20:51,984
There's some really good stuff in here that
helps maintain the value of our brand...

319
00:20:52,019 --> 00:20:54,885
as well as the consistency of our
approach for the customer.

320
00:20:55,520 --> 00:21:00,525
<i>Here are a couple that you'll see here at our
Klown Kutz in Scottsdale. Some of my favorites.</i>

321
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:03,779
This is the one thatAI uses almost
every day. Looks good on him.

322
00:21:03,814 --> 00:21:06,999
Not one of my favorites. Very low
maintenance. Not a lot of heart.

323
00:21:07,034 --> 00:21:09,126
But, it looks good on him.

324
00:21:09,468 --> 00:21:12,804
Okay everybody, noses on. Come on,
you know. You play like you practice.

325
00:21:12,839 --> 00:21:17,764
Nose on, Al. Let's go.
And thank you, Beth, for having yours on.

326
00:21:18,510 --> 00:21:20,979
A couple of things to talk about
this morning from corporate.

327
00:21:21,014 --> 00:21:24,176
Real simple, we're not selling enough hairouts.

328
00:21:24,249 --> 00:21:27,517
We've got more Klownz than we've got Kutz.
So we have upside here.

329
00:21:27,552 --> 00:21:32,022
So, what's the answer? First, we've got
to get our Kutz to Klownz ratio up.

330
00:21:32,057 --> 00:21:37,345
First thing to do is to ask every parent that
brings a tyke in here, "Do you want a haircut?"

331
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:41,942
It's very simple. Let's get mom. Scissors, mom, head.
She's already here, let's cut her hair.

332
00:21:41,977 --> 00:21:46,505
Remember, there's no shame in getting your
haircut by a Klown. And help them understand...

333
00:21:46,540 --> 00:21:51,141
...that the hairout's free, it's the Klown
you're paying for. Understand? Great.

334
00:21:51,176 --> 00:21:58,266
Secondly, right here today. We've got a new
promotion. Anybody that can juggle for a customer.

335
00:21:58,301 --> 00:22:05,357
The first one, wins a brand new Sony AM, FM,
Weather,40 preset Walkman. Can anybody juggle?

336
00:22:05,392 --> 00:22:06,223
<i>I can juggle.</i>

337
00:22:06,258 --> 00:22:10,092
Beth can juggle. Let's see.
One, two, three. Here we go.

338
00:22:11,363 --> 00:22:12,929
Hey, there we go, we have a winner everybody.

339
00:22:12,964 --> 00:22:17,836
Beth, enjoy this in good health.
Watch out for the radio waves - gives you cancer.

340
00:22:17,871 --> 00:22:21,638
You two guys, I have two more of those in my office.

341
00:22:21,673 --> 00:22:24,972
Go home, practice with your
balls, you can each have one.

342
00:22:25,077 --> 00:22:30,082
<i>You know, to tell you the truth, I just started
getting into the frozen entree collecting.</i>

343
00:22:30,117 --> 00:22:33,151
<i>Shawn, of course, has been doing it his whole life.</i>

344
00:22:33,186 --> 00:22:35,938
<i>It wasn't until Shelly, that I got into it.</i>

345
00:22:35,973 --> 00:22:38,655
She's a super gal. She is just totally awesome.

346
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:44,029
You see, when we made the switch, from
punk band to Christian band...

347
00:22:44,064 --> 00:22:46,396
Shelly would come to all of our shows.

348
00:22:46,431 --> 00:22:51,536
She would go up to Shawn and they
would be talking about the frozen entrees.

349
00:22:51,571 --> 00:22:54,404
And, man, she just - out of the gate, boom.

350
00:22:54,439 --> 00:23:00,879
<i>All that excitement got me going
and I got a collection for myself.</i>

351
00:23:00,914 --> 00:23:03,580
She helped me out along the way.

352
00:23:03,615 --> 00:23:07,346
She told me what entrees I should be keeping,
what entrees I should be selling.

353
00:23:07,419 --> 00:23:10,855
Man, she's just such a super gal.

354
00:23:12,190 --> 00:23:18,063
<i>I started working here, at the Clinton Center,
I guess it was about a year and a halfago.</i>

355
00:23:18,098 --> 00:23:20,699
- Hey Sarah.
- Good morning Shelly. How was your weekend?

356
00:23:20,734 --> 00:23:22,466
Super good. How was yours?

357
00:23:22,501 --> 00:23:24,196
- Great. Thank you.
- Oh, okay good.

358
00:23:25,437 --> 00:23:28,240
- Hey Shelly, nice sweater.
- Hey Candy, thank you.

359
00:23:28,275 --> 00:23:30,435
I loved it in '82.

360
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:34,846
Wait a minute... Sorry. I'm sorry.

361
00:23:35,113 --> 00:23:39,316
<i>Now I'm on the hotline, which is
pretty nice - really challenging.</i>

362
00:23:39,351 --> 00:23:45,889
<i>Answer calls all day, eat my lunch,
answer more calls. It's pretty busy.</i>

363
00:23:45,924 --> 00:23:51,997
Hello Sarah? Hi this is Shelly.
I'm one of the the abstinence counselors here.

364
00:23:52,032 --> 00:23:54,727
I'm sorry you had to wait. Thanks for waiting...

365
00:23:55,000 --> 00:24:00,233
Right it says, uh... Lets see,
I've been told that you're virgin... Oh.

366
00:24:00,405 --> 00:24:04,509
<i>They call into our triage center, at first
The triage counselor will talk to them.</i>

367
00:24:04,544 --> 00:24:11,515
They figure out what level it is - of acuity.
So, if it's someone who's...

368
00:24:11,550 --> 00:24:18,479
Maybe they've taken some clothes off. Maybe
they're doing something they shouldn't be doing.

369
00:24:18,924 --> 00:24:25,227
Maybe they're even naked. Maybe they're even...
Anyway, those are obviously the highest priority.

370
00:24:25,297 --> 00:24:28,233
<i>They go right away to whoever's available.</i>

371
00:24:28,268 --> 00:24:32,101
Okay, go ahead... I'm sorry?

372
00:24:33,538 --> 00:24:35,768
You're having a 'rusty trombone? '

373
00:24:37,242 --> 00:24:39,709
Oh, you're giving a 'rusty trombone.' Sorry.

374
00:24:39,744 --> 00:24:44,113
Um, could you hold for just a minute please?
Thank you.

375
00:24:44,516 --> 00:24:47,314
Does anyone know what a "RustyTrombone" is!?

376
00:24:48,453 --> 00:24:51,786
It's a hand job and a rim job at the same time.
It's all on the sheet.

377
00:24:52,591 --> 00:24:53,751
Thanks.

378
00:24:54,893 --> 00:24:57,953
Oh, gee. Oh, my gosh. Okay.

379
00:24:59,097 --> 00:25:02,334
Hi, you still there? You still with me? Okay, good.

380
00:25:02,369 --> 00:25:05,462
Um, is this in progress right now?

381
00:25:06,204 --> 00:25:07,137
Oh, boy. Oh, boy.

382
00:25:07,172 --> 00:25:11,074
<i>Okay... Alright... um...just stay calm.</i>

383
00:25:11,409 --> 00:25:13,206
Right. Do you have some cold water?

384
00:25:13,545 --> 00:25:17,315
People ask me, you know, "How do you do it?
How do you maintain your celibacy?"

385
00:25:17,350 --> 00:25:21,418
And, one of the tips that I've found works for me...

386
00:25:21,453 --> 00:25:28,159
<i>...is just collecting a lot of images ofJesus and
putting them in different places kind of strategically.</i>

387
00:25:28,194 --> 00:25:33,722
<i>Places where your celibacy might be compromised.
And it's a reminder all the time...</i>

388
00:25:33,798 --> 00:25:38,758
...that you'd better stay on track.
Because, Jesus can see you.

389
00:25:38,904 --> 00:25:42,670
And, I mean, he can see you even in the dark.

390
00:25:42,841 --> 00:25:50,282
Aware of possible future litigations brought by
the victim and any surviving family members...

391
00:25:50,317 --> 00:25:54,985
<i>I resisted my human instinct to assist in his recovery.</i>

392
00:25:55,020 --> 00:26:00,792
<i>I spoke in a calm, steady voice as I advised
him of the content of several waivers...</i>

393
00:26:00,827 --> 00:26:04,761
...he would be required to sign before
treatment could resume.

394
00:26:04,796 --> 00:26:08,667
Okay, cut Charles. That's good. I just need
you to be a little more enthusiastic.

395
00:26:08,702 --> 00:26:12,555
A little more vulnerable perhaps.
It's a journey. Take me on that journey.

396
00:26:12,590 --> 00:26:16,373
I want to go along. My bags are packed.
I'm ready to go. I'm at the station.

397
00:26:16,408 --> 00:26:21,413
So, just bring me along. Just be a little more childlike.
A little more enthusiasm perhaps.

398
00:26:21,448 --> 00:26:26,373
Just work with it. You got it.
Amp it up a little bit. And... action.

399
00:26:29,754 --> 00:26:35,760
<i>In addition to my duties as a firefighter, I actually
produce and direct training videos for the squad.</i>

400
00:26:35,795 --> 00:26:42,100
Last year, I'm quite proud of the fact that I...
One of my productions won a Golden Hose Award.

401
00:26:42,135 --> 00:26:46,871
It's very prestigious. It's an award for
excellence in video production.

402
00:26:46,906 --> 00:26:51,831
Whew! What blaze. Thanks fellas. Job well done.

403
00:26:52,777 --> 00:26:57,480
Gosh, just a year ago I was just
a regular guy dragging a hose.

404
00:26:57,515 --> 00:27:03,421
But since the tragic events of nine eleven, I've
become a hero to a confused and frightened nation.

405
00:27:03,456 --> 00:27:07,759
Every man wants to be me.
Every woman wants my seed.

406
00:27:07,794 --> 00:27:10,023
That's an awful lot of pressure.

407
00:27:11,429 --> 00:27:17,736
Hi, I'm Scott Baxter, firefighter with
the Sunnyslope Municipality Fire Department.

408
00:27:17,771 --> 00:27:22,696
And today, we're going to learn,"HowTo Be A Hero."

409
00:27:24,075 --> 00:27:27,277
<i>My guys here at Station 7 are truly amazing.</i>

410
00:27:27,312 --> 00:27:30,880
They're fabulous.
They do find me a little mysterious...

411
00:27:30,915 --> 00:27:35,870
...and I get some ribbings and raspberries
occasionally, but it's all in love and I take it that way.

412
00:27:35,905 --> 00:27:40,825
I don't take it personally. I think deep down,
they're a little curious to the fact that I'm a...

413
00:27:40,860 --> 00:27:45,041
...frozen entree collector. It's a little out
there. It's a little weird. I'll admit it.

414
00:27:45,076 --> 00:27:49,223
But that's just who I am. An artist. I have
that kind of soul. It needs to be expressed.

415
00:27:49,467 --> 00:27:53,238
<i>I'll tell you, it's great having him around the
station. That guy makes a real good quiche.</i>

416
00:27:53,273 --> 00:27:57,226
And you know one other thing,
that guy gives a hell of a rubdown.

417
00:27:57,261 --> 00:28:01,179
Apparently, when Scott got here,
he was'queer'. Sorry -'homo'.

418
00:28:01,214 --> 00:28:03,780
But I guess he's got that cleared up.

419
00:28:03,815 --> 00:28:08,186
You know, being a firefighter;
it's kind of like being part of a brotherhood.

420
00:28:08,221 --> 00:28:14,826
We've all got baggage. I don't
care if you're an alcoholic, queer...

421
00:28:14,861 --> 00:28:18,785
...Mexican; we've all got stuff
we're trying to work out.

422
00:28:19,264 --> 00:28:22,028
I used to have a hell of a gambling problem.

423
00:28:24,335 --> 00:28:28,640
<i>You know, with my scheduling at work, I can pretty
much take every Thursday afternoon off...</i>

424
00:28:28,675 --> 00:28:32,661
<i>...to come out here and practice my
fundamentals and really work on my game.</i>

425
00:28:32,696 --> 00:28:36,613
Folks have been playing theAphabet
Game along the highways and byways...

426
00:28:36,648 --> 00:28:41,986
...of this great nation of ours for years.
And now we have a sanctioned league.

427
00:28:42,021 --> 00:28:46,590
The league has kept the rules basically
the same as I've known them since a boy.

428
00:28:46,625 --> 00:28:51,159
They've made a few minor changes.
Just made it more conducive for league play.

429
00:28:51,996 --> 00:28:54,964
<i>The player that wins the coin
toss elects to drive or passenge.</i>

430
00:28:54,999 --> 00:28:58,937
<i>The players look for a word that begins
with the letter "A" on a billboard or sign.</i>

431
00:28:58,972 --> 00:29:02,532
The first player to call out
that word, receives a point.

432
00:29:02,907 --> 00:29:05,744
Karen! Could you keep your yunguns
away from the gasoline!

433
00:29:05,779 --> 00:29:07,336
We're gonna be rolling out in a minute here.

434
00:29:12,717 --> 00:29:14,250
<i>"Beaver!" "Creek!"</i>

435
00:29:14,285 --> 00:29:19,290
Passenger. Phrase combination.
Two-banger. Bravo, Charlie.

436
00:29:19,325 --> 00:29:22,123
(cheering and booing)

437
00:29:22,627 --> 00:29:25,195
"Diesel!" "Exit!" "Farm!"

438
00:29:25,230 --> 00:29:28,859
Driver. Triple combination. Delta, Echo, Foxtrot.

439
00:29:32,971 --> 00:29:35,701
Al non-human roadkill is considered wild.

440
00:29:36,441 --> 00:29:41,572
The player simply points to the roadkill and declares
the letter he or she wishes to choose.

441
00:29:43,348 --> 00:29:44,814
<i>Roadkill X!</i>

442
00:29:44,849 --> 00:29:48,818
Driver's point. Roadkill rule. X-ray.

443
00:29:48,853 --> 00:29:53,389
The roadkill rule was enacted to
alleviate a reoccurring situation...

444
00:29:53,424 --> 00:29:58,930
...in which several games carried on for
hundreds of miles and hours and hours...

445
00:29:58,965 --> 00:30:01,125
...searching for an X or a Dairy Queen.

446
00:30:08,139 --> 00:30:10,437
Valley! Yeah!

447
00:30:10,508 --> 00:30:11,943
<i>(cheering and booing)
(whistle blows)</i>

448
00:30:11,978 --> 00:30:14,173
<i>Diver's point - Victor.</i>

449
00:30:14,245 --> 00:30:16,815
Match goes to driver.
That is the game gentleman.

450
00:30:16,850 --> 00:30:19,579
That's a good game. Good game.

451
00:30:19,651 --> 00:30:24,120
Now I know, I play the Aphabet Game
and collect frozen food entrees...

452
00:30:24,155 --> 00:30:28,792
...and it's not the coolest thing to do but I've
never been one to stay on the beaten path.

453
00:30:28,827 --> 00:30:34,732
And as a safety and efficiency consultant, I think the
most ironic thing is that I play such a danger sport.

454
00:30:37,702 --> 00:30:42,707
<i>Right now the entree club has a few people-
oriented challenges. Shawn, in particular.</i>

455
00:30:42,742 --> 00:30:45,275
He definitely needs to workshop those people skills.

456
00:30:45,310 --> 00:30:51,282
You see, it takes teamwork to make the dream work.
And that's what we're all about here at Ex-Team.

457
00:30:51,317 --> 00:30:54,951
<i>Based on research conducted at Yale,
on the immensely strong bond...</i>

458
00:30:54,986 --> 00:31:00,892
<i>...that exists between combat soldiers, we've created
the Ex-TeamViet Cong Prison Camp Experience.</i>

459
00:31:00,927 --> 00:31:03,893
In order to create a bond
like that on the corporate level...

460
00:31:03,928 --> 00:31:07,430
...we put our participants through
a living, breathing hell on earth...

461
00:31:07,465 --> 00:31:13,597
...designed to breakdown the individual spirit, while
building up the ultimate, unbeatable corporate team.

462
00:31:13,972 --> 00:31:16,606
<i>(jungle sounds)</i>

463
00:31:16,641 --> 00:31:19,711
<i>Okay, Jerry, I'm going to put you
back with the folks in accounting now.</i>

464
00:31:19,746 --> 00:31:22,812
What I need from you is for
you to be a team leader today...

465
00:31:22,847 --> 00:31:27,151
...and for you to create a win-win synergy for
the team. You think you can do that for us?

466
00:31:27,186 --> 00:31:29,312
- Yes sir.
- Perfect. Cut him down.

467
00:31:31,923 --> 00:31:34,157
<i>Hey, I knew it was going to take a brave company.</i>

468
00:31:34,192 --> 00:31:36,960
One with a pioneer spirit
to be the first one on board.

469
00:31:36,995 --> 00:31:42,567
After months of doors slamming in our faces, we
finally get our first client. And who is it?

470
00:31:42,602 --> 00:31:47,537
Disney. Huge.
They sent us over 200 of their imagineers.

471
00:31:47,572 --> 00:31:51,641
The program proved very successful
in weeding out their deadwood.

472
00:31:51,676 --> 00:31:57,512
Over half the participants chose to quit their jobs,
rather than complete the nine-week program.

473
00:31:57,715 --> 00:32:01,818
You know what?
A lot of pussys over there at Disney.

474
00:32:01,853 --> 00:32:06,491
But I'll tell you this much; the one's that
did decide to suck it up and finish the program...

475
00:32:06,526 --> 00:32:08,157
...changed their lives forever.

476
00:32:08,192 --> 00:32:13,498
You know, before my prison camp experience,
I was working downstairs in the mail room.

477
00:32:13,533 --> 00:32:17,133
Strictly part time basis. Look at me now, I'm upstairs.

478
00:32:17,168 --> 00:32:20,805
I'm in charge of Goofy merchandising
for most of the west coast.

479
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:24,407
My numbers are high, management
pleased, it's all good.

480
00:32:24,442 --> 00:32:29,106
And to this day, I still find myself
referring to my sales competition as Charlie.

481
00:32:29,614 --> 00:32:33,016
<i>Now days you go to a seminar
and they get you all fired up.</i>

482
00:32:33,051 --> 00:32:37,956
But I'll guarantee you this - a week to two weeks
later, you've forgotten everything that you've learned.

483
00:32:37,991 --> 00:32:41,893
Now the participants of the
VC experience never forget.

484
00:32:41,928 --> 00:32:44,487
They're still having flashbacks years later.

485
00:32:46,831 --> 00:32:52,136
<i>The thing about being a hygienist is that you've got to
have a hook. It's just like being a musician.</i>

486
00:32:52,171 --> 00:32:56,358
<i>You have to have something to bring the people in
and make them ask for you by name.</i>

487
00:32:56,393 --> 00:33:00,545
So my hook as hygienist is... I just tell
people, "I don't give a shit if you floss."

488
00:33:00,580 --> 00:33:04,914
You know? And, I'm telling you, I
got people lining up out the door to book me.

489
00:33:07,385 --> 00:33:12,021
Are you going to open?
Well, because it's a little bit after.

490
00:33:12,056 --> 00:33:17,016
It's like a little after the time. I thought
you opened at... Didn't you...

491
00:33:17,595 --> 00:33:22,089
Hey, Veronica. We'll be open in a couple of
minutes if you want to go grab your booth.

492
00:33:22,433 --> 00:33:25,493
It's Shelly. But okay, thanks.

493
00:33:27,839 --> 00:33:33,444
<i>The No Choice Cafe is an anti-abortion themed Christian
cafe and it's really an experiment for us.</i>

494
00:33:33,479 --> 00:33:40,118
We're trying to set up these locations
next to or adjacent to abortion clinics...

495
00:33:40,153 --> 00:33:42,085
<i>...all across the United States.</i>

496
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:47,080
And if our third quarter projections are right,
we've really hit a home run here.

497
00:33:47,725 --> 00:33:52,130
<i>We're looking at having five stores in the
Metro Phoenix area within the next year...</i>

498
00:33:52,165 --> 00:33:56,332
<i>...and then also opening up
seven stores inAlabama,...</i>

499
00:33:56,367 --> 00:34:00,738
<i>...which should be really big for us
to have that foothold in the south.</i>

500
00:34:00,773 --> 00:34:03,906
<i>When I looked at this place I thought,
"Wow, this is perfect"</i>

501
00:34:03,941 --> 00:34:08,312
<i>It's across from a natural market
and I kept seeing these people.</i>

502
00:34:08,347 --> 00:34:10,480
<i>And I thought, what are they doing out there?</i>

503
00:34:10,515 --> 00:34:14,886
<i>They're protesting, they're yelling
things, there's different slogans.</i>

504
00:34:14,921 --> 00:34:16,686
<i>I thought, these people have to be hungry.</i>

505
00:34:16,721 --> 00:34:24,462
<i>As the rents kind of plummeted, I moved in and all
of a sudden I was taking advantage of...</i>

506
00:34:24,497 --> 00:34:29,432
...or I was actually catering to the protestors.

507
00:34:29,467 --> 00:34:34,670
<i>Protesting is not easy. It can be a real
bitch. I mean, it's hot out here in Phoenix.</i>

508
00:34:34,705 --> 00:34:41,112
You're standing on your feet all day, you've got to
make signs, it can be a real drag on your day.

509
00:34:41,147 --> 00:34:42,645
That's what's great about the No Choice.

510
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:49,387
<i>You can come in, take a load off on the Protest
Patio and really keep vigil over the unborn.</i>

511
00:34:49,422 --> 00:34:51,154
BABY KILLER!!!

512
00:34:51,189 --> 00:34:54,249
<i>...while enjoying a latte or a sandwich or a scone.</i>

513
00:34:54,425 --> 00:34:59,385
The first time I saw Shawn and A's band,
I was like their super huge biggest fan.

514
00:34:59,730 --> 00:35:02,298
I saw them at this Christian rock festival.

515
00:35:02,333 --> 00:35:06,602
Shawn told me that they used
to be really hard-core...

516
00:35:06,637 --> 00:35:12,510
...and they were called like the
Reach Ups or the Reach Outs?

517
00:35:12,545 --> 00:35:15,445
<i>I don't know, but anyway.</i>

518
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:20,785
<i>It's hard for me to picture them being like
that because now they're really Christian.</i>

519
00:35:20,820 --> 00:35:22,585
- Hey Shelly.
- Oh, hey Doug.

520
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:24,454
- Been reading the word?
- Oh, of course.

521
00:35:24,489 --> 00:35:27,358
Praise him, praise him. I just want
to let you know I have prayer cirole.

522
00:35:27,393 --> 00:35:29,594
But then I'll be right back and I'll
take your order for you, okay?

523
00:35:29,629 --> 00:35:32,894
Come on, people! Let's move alright?
A little hustle here.

524
00:35:32,929 --> 00:35:36,159
We're opening in five minutes.
Come on. Let's go, let's go.

525
00:35:37,935 --> 00:35:43,374
<i>Milo's the one who brought them into
that and put them on a spiritual path toJesus.</i>

526
00:35:43,409 --> 00:35:45,575
<i>He's just filled with the light of the lord.</i>

527
00:35:45,610 --> 00:35:49,341
Look, people! Please! Pipe down.
We've got a lot of work to do today, alright?

528
00:35:49,747 --> 00:35:51,612
Let's get this thing over with.

529
00:35:58,956 --> 00:36:02,325
Our Father, who art in Heaven.
Hear our humble prayer.

530
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:10,290
Oh Lord, feel free to bequeath upon us an ample
lunch crowd and fruitful walk-by traffic.

531
00:36:10,368 --> 00:36:19,277
I've been a promoter on the local and regional
Christian rock scene for the last ten years now.

532
00:36:19,312 --> 00:36:23,373
And Shawn and his band are
definitely my main gig right now.

533
00:36:24,215 --> 00:36:29,136
<i>(lyrics) Hey you are the Lord,
I hear you knock upon my door.</i>

534
00:36:29,171 --> 00:36:34,100
<i>Hey you are the Lord,
you heal the sick and wash the poor.</i>

535
00:36:34,135 --> 00:36:38,995
<i>Hey you are the Lord,
I hear you knock upon my door.</i>

536
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:43,467
<i>Hey you are the Lord,
You heal the sick and you wash the poor.</i>

537
00:36:43,502 --> 00:36:48,427
<i>Wash the poor, the dirty, dirty poor!</i>

538
00:36:49,106 --> 00:36:51,340
I promote them, I manage them...

539
00:36:51,375 --> 00:36:56,039
...and I baby-sit them,
when they need it. Which is often.

540
00:36:56,380 --> 00:37:01,385
Don't get me wrong guys. I like it.
I like that little backbeat. It's cute.

541
00:37:01,420 --> 00:37:06,622
But, I mean, the lyrical formula is quite simple.

542
00:37:06,657 --> 00:37:13,331
Right? It's - man has problem, man finds Jesus,
Jesus fixes problem - repeat.

543
00:37:13,366 --> 00:37:14,931
Twelve, don't look at me like that.

544
00:37:14,966 --> 00:37:20,087
If you think that Bob fromTrinity Records is gonna
come down here and not expect yourA-game...

545
00:37:20,122 --> 00:37:25,209
...you're sadly mistaken. This is the Christian music
business but it's still the music business.

546
00:37:25,244 --> 00:37:29,612
If you guys don't perform,
he will fuck your ass.

547
00:37:31,549 --> 00:37:33,141
Fuck!

548
00:37:34,252 --> 00:37:37,119
Shit! God damn it!

549
00:37:39,357 --> 00:37:44,929
I don't know. I miss the old band.
That's when it was me and Shawn all the way.

550
00:37:44,964 --> 00:37:48,331
<i>- I mean, that was our band.
- Fuck! Come here little ball.</i>

551
00:37:48,366 --> 00:37:52,937
Now it's all Shawn and Milo and this whole
Christian thing. And I don't agree with any of it.

552
00:37:52,972 --> 00:37:54,038
You know? It's like...

553
00:37:54,073 --> 00:37:55,137
<i>Fuck me!</i>

554
00:37:55,172 --> 00:38:00,542
But I don't necessarily have a plan of my own so
I guess I'll go with what they're saying.

555
00:38:00,778 --> 00:38:05,545
God damn it! Fuck this! Shit!

556
00:38:07,118 --> 00:38:11,472
My outfit puts on the Christapaloosa
show every year over at the Gardens.

557
00:38:11,507 --> 00:38:15,826
Last year I received a call from
Shawn and he was pulling no punches.

558
00:38:15,861 --> 00:38:18,694
He said that he and his band
were more secular in nature...

559
00:38:18,729 --> 00:38:21,932
but that they were looking to
break into the Christian rock scene.

560
00:38:21,967 --> 00:38:24,402
We talked a little bit about
the buzz and the excitement...

561
00:38:24,437 --> 00:38:26,569
...and the merohandising surrounding the event.

562
00:38:26,604 --> 00:38:32,710
And Shawn thought this was really the impetus that
it would take for him to make that leap of faith...

563
00:38:32,745 --> 00:38:36,168
...and come onto the side
of the Lord in His glory.

564
00:38:37,882 --> 00:38:38,871
Caitlin?

565
00:38:39,884 --> 00:38:44,755
Hey sweetie. How you doing? Is that operculum still
obscuring your numberthree molar?

566
00:38:44,790 --> 00:38:45,588
I don't know.

567
00:38:45,623 --> 00:38:48,183
Well, let's dig in and find out.

568
00:38:49,593 --> 00:38:54,553
(drill whistle)

569
00:38:56,067 --> 00:38:57,364
Okay, good.

570
00:38:57,635 --> 00:38:59,125
I knew that Milo...

571
00:39:00,304 --> 00:39:06,344
I knew that I couldn't send Milo a tape of the band
as it was if we wanted him to work with us...

572
00:39:06,379 --> 00:39:10,279
because the lyrics were
pretty dirty and everything.

573
00:39:10,314 --> 00:39:13,751
<i>So, we just set to rewriting
the lyrics right there in the studio.</i>

574
00:39:13,786 --> 00:39:16,218
<i>Me and Al sat down and
worked on the lyrics.</i>

575
00:39:16,253 --> 00:39:20,222
<i>We just stayed up late nights.
Not only did we rewrite the lyrics...</i>

576
00:39:20,257 --> 00:39:24,495
<i>...we re-recorded all the vocals so
that we had anA version and a B version</i>

577
00:39:24,530 --> 00:39:25,761
...of each one of our songs.

578
00:39:25,796 --> 00:39:28,798
<i>(singing) Fuck! I love to fuck! I fuckin' love to fuck!</i>

579
00:39:28,833 --> 00:39:33,704
<i>I love to fuck fat girls! I love to fuck
skinny girls! I love to fuck pretty girls!</i>

580
00:39:33,739 --> 00:39:36,832
<i>I love to fuck any girl who wants to get fucked!</i>

581
00:39:37,408 --> 00:39:40,641
Hey, that was pretty good.
Let's roll it back from the top though...

582
00:39:40,676 --> 00:39:43,875
...and this time let's do the new
Christian lyric version. Stand by.

583
00:39:44,315 --> 00:39:47,850
<i>Hey! I've got to pray! Pray every single day!</i>

584
00:39:47,885 --> 00:39:51,654
Wow. What a disc.
They brought it in. I listened to it.

585
00:39:51,689 --> 00:39:55,921
It was that rough, raw, hard sound that I was
looking for. I knew that it was going to sell.

586
00:39:56,827 --> 00:40:00,531
Milo was pretty happy with it. Of course
there was still the issue of the name.

587
00:40:00,566 --> 00:40:04,533
<i>Man, we argued...
We went round and round about that.</i>

588
00:40:04,568 --> 00:40:09,733
<i>I think we probably went through a
hundred names before we finally arrived on one.</i>

589
00:40:12,109 --> 00:40:14,771
But from there it's ah...

590
00:40:18,115 --> 00:40:23,320
It's all gone really, really well. And now we
have this huge showcase coming up and...

591
00:40:23,355 --> 00:40:27,323
<i>Shawn, you're brother's on
line two with the TTY operator.</i>

592
00:40:27,358 --> 00:40:30,661
I'm with a patient. Just tell him I'll
call him back would you?

593
00:40:30,696 --> 00:40:33,747
<i>Well, I guess it's an emergency.</i>

594
00:40:33,782 --> 00:40:36,799
Aright. Just put him through.

595
00:40:38,002 --> 00:40:44,006
Yes hello. I have aTTY call from
Chris Anderson. Go ahead.

596
00:40:44,041 --> 00:40:47,778
Chris, I'm with a patient right now.
What's the big emergency? Go ahead.

597
00:40:47,813 --> 00:40:49,336
What'sTTY?

598
00:40:50,414 --> 00:40:55,219
You see, my brother's deaf.
So, he can't make a regular phone call...

599
00:40:55,254 --> 00:40:57,319
...so what he has to do is...

600
00:40:57,354 --> 00:41:01,123
<i>We're out of beer. Get some on your
way home. Go ahead.</i>

601
00:41:01,158 --> 00:41:05,930
Chris, that is not an emergency. These calls
are getting me in trouble with Dr. Shapiro.

602
00:41:05,965 --> 00:41:09,133
So look, I will call you back
when I get a break, okay?

603
00:41:09,168 --> 00:41:11,795
And don't use my shampoo. Go ahead.

604
00:41:16,207 --> 00:41:19,341
<i>Yes it is an emergency, fuck-stick.</i>

605
00:41:19,376 --> 00:41:22,678
<i>I've been out of beer since
eleven o'clock this morning.</i>

606
00:41:22,713 --> 00:41:29,016
<i>If your boss is such a prick, you should
tell him to go fuck himself. Go ahead.</i>

607
00:41:29,787 --> 00:41:34,747
Haaaaaahhhhh!

608
00:41:44,768 --> 00:41:47,870
<i>Well, I toldAI I'd get him a
job in the mail room at Merrill.</i>

609
00:41:47,905 --> 00:41:54,140
<i>I know he'd make a lot more money there than
he does working at Klown Kutz as a 'smilist'</i>

610
00:41:55,913 --> 00:41:59,582
Hey Al. How's it going?
Is that a new suit? Is that silk?

611
00:41:59,617 --> 00:42:02,586
<i>Hey Al! Aren't you going to spend
some quality time with your big brother?</i>

612
00:42:02,621 --> 00:42:04,247
No. I don't think so.

613
00:42:11,128 --> 00:42:14,630
It's go time forAI. He's thirty two years old.

614
00:42:14,665 --> 00:42:19,635
He needs to get himself a
defined, proactive career path.

615
00:42:19,670 --> 00:42:22,137
He needs to move out of my folks house.
And he needs to get himself a girlfriend.

616
00:42:22,172 --> 00:42:29,346
He's in a band for God's sake and every musician I've
ever known has been hip-deep in pussy all the time.

617
00:42:29,381 --> 00:42:32,248
But Chucky, it's a Christian band that he's...

618
00:42:32,283 --> 00:42:35,417
Mum. Let me tell you something
about these Christian girls.

619
00:42:35,452 --> 00:42:40,412
When you're banging 'em, they feel
all guilty and dirty about it. It's awesome.

620
00:42:40,958 --> 00:42:46,830
Now, I know he's got this thing for
Shelly but I've told him over and over...

621
00:42:46,865 --> 00:42:52,291
...they don't want a friend. They want a man.

622
00:42:53,337 --> 00:42:56,829
<i>She's not my girlfriend, but this one's for Shelly.</i>

623
00:43:47,024 --> 00:43:52,155
Al and I are really good friends. We do a lot of
stuff together. We have so much in common.

624
00:43:52,863 --> 00:43:57,501
A lot of our friends are like, "When are you guys
going to get together? You're like a perfect couple."

625
00:43:57,536 --> 00:44:00,636
I don't know. I would never do that.

626
00:44:00,671 --> 00:44:03,641
Because I would never do
anything to jeopardize our friendship.

627
00:44:03,676 --> 00:44:05,836
It's just so perfect the way it is.

628
00:44:32,169 --> 00:44:34,703
I don't know. Shawn is just so amazing.

629
00:44:34,738 --> 00:44:36,840
I just feel like there's nothing he can't do.

630
00:44:36,875 --> 00:44:39,608
Shhyeah... Well, I can think of a few.

631
00:44:39,643 --> 00:44:43,579
"YouAreThe Lord."
I think that's going to be on the radio.

632
00:44:43,614 --> 00:44:46,750
- Yes, I agree.
- And I just can't believe he
wrote that it's just beautiful.

633
00:44:46,785 --> 00:44:48,552
Actually, I wrote that one.

634
00:44:48,587 --> 00:44:49,418
Oh, you did?

635
00:44:49,453 --> 00:44:56,743
Yeah, I wrote that one. I wrote "Righteous
Jew," I wrote "Salute Jesus." That was all me.

636
00:44:56,778 --> 00:45:03,999
Well, isn't it great that you have someone like
Shawn to really bring those lyrics to life?

637
00:45:04,034 --> 00:45:10,908
Because lyrics on a page by themselves can seem
really boring if you don't have a really good singer.

638
00:45:10,943 --> 00:45:15,145
Well, listen. I mean, not to take away
from Shawn. Shawn is a great...

639
00:45:15,180 --> 00:45:18,080
Do you think... Just honestly...

640
00:45:18,115 --> 00:45:22,677
Do you think we'd make a good couple?
Like if he just...

641
00:45:23,487 --> 00:45:26,786
Shelly, we don't have to go over
this every time do we?

642
00:45:27,825 --> 00:45:30,861
<i>- We don't go over it every time.
- You know the kind of girls that Shawn likes.</i>

643
00:45:30,896 --> 00:45:35,195
Shawn has a particular taste and...

644
00:45:37,034 --> 00:45:38,902
<i>- AI.
- Shelly, you're a sweet gal.</i>

645
00:45:38,937 --> 00:45:40,035
Okay, Shawn is...

646
00:45:40,070 --> 00:45:43,872
A, what are you doing?
You don't have to fold my clothes.

647
00:45:43,907 --> 00:45:47,276
Don't worry about it.
Now, Shelly, you've got to listen to me.

648
00:45:47,311 --> 00:45:52,649
I've been friends with a lot of Shawn's ex's,
you know. I've consoled a lot of broken hearts.

649
00:45:52,684 --> 00:45:58,645
Ever since the eighth grade. So, listen
Shelly, you're just a sweet gal. Don't...

650
00:46:00,991 --> 00:46:02,083
Don't listen to me.

651
00:46:11,235 --> 00:46:15,569
He's not calling you is he!? Shelly?

652
00:46:21,378 --> 00:46:22,845
<i>(filmmaker) So, are you stealing them?</i>

653
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:29,486
No, no. See, I'll just give him the cash
and then he'll hang onto it until midnight.

654
00:46:29,521 --> 00:46:32,387
<i>They're just Nazis about their release dates.</i>

655
00:46:32,422 --> 00:46:35,793
<i>If the new dinners aren't supposed
to be out until Friday...</i>

656
00:46:35,828 --> 00:46:40,093
<i>...you can not buy them until l2:0 I AM on Friday.</i>

657
00:46:45,936 --> 00:46:51,897
They're finally here. This is it. It's like Christmas
morning, you know? Well, here we go.

658
00:46:59,082 --> 00:47:01,846
Holy shit. They're blue.

659
00:47:08,492 --> 00:47:14,263
(club members cheer)

660
00:47:14,298 --> 00:47:17,995
<i>That's great! Amazing!
Now, that website is awesome.</i>

661
00:47:22,606 --> 00:47:27,211
Hey! I just got to get with Milo on a couple
of things and I'll be right there but I got 'em.

662
00:47:27,246 --> 00:47:28,544
Keep an eye on those things.

663
00:47:28,579 --> 00:47:30,914
Wait. Is that Chris? Is that Shawn's brother?

664
00:47:30,949 --> 00:47:32,514
Yeah. That's him.

665
00:47:32,549 --> 00:47:34,813
Okay. Let's see if I can remember this.

666
00:47:36,887 --> 00:47:42,450
I... Learned... Sign... Language.

667
00:47:51,034 --> 00:47:52,467
<i>- Milo!
- Hey, how are you?</i>

668
00:47:52,502 --> 00:47:54,872
- Good, man. How you doing?
- You guys ready to rock?

669
00:47:54,907 --> 00:47:55,771
- Fuckin'A.
- Aright man.

670
00:47:55,806 --> 00:47:59,292
Hey listen, I've got my entree
club meeting for about an hour...

671
00:47:59,327 --> 00:48:02,779
...and then I'll hook up with you
on all the gig stuff for tonight.

672
00:48:02,814 --> 00:48:04,440
By the way, this is my brother Chris.

673
00:48:04,748 --> 00:48:06,978
Chris! Shake the fucking hand.

674
00:48:07,284 --> 00:48:09,081
How's it hanging!?

675
00:48:09,686 --> 00:48:12,054
- Retarded?
- No, no. He's deaf.

676
00:48:12,089 --> 00:48:14,441
Dude, I'm sorry. I didn't
mean to offend you or...

677
00:48:14,476 --> 00:48:16,793
Do not even think twice about it.
He can't hear shit.

678
00:48:16,828 --> 00:48:18,124
Oh, good.

679
00:48:20,330 --> 00:48:25,302
<i>Hey! Huh!? Did I tell you or did I tell you!?</i>

680
00:48:25,337 --> 00:48:28,071
Aright, who wants to see them first?

681
00:48:28,106 --> 00:48:30,339
(excited chatter)

682
00:48:30,374 --> 00:48:34,470
Alright, here we go.
First of all, SwansonAngus Beef.

683
00:48:36,213 --> 00:48:38,215
<i>Oh they're blue. I didn't know
they were going to be blue.</i>

684
00:48:38,250 --> 00:48:40,617
Yeah, they're blue. They look fantastic.

685
00:48:40,652 --> 00:48:43,279
Okay, Classic Fried Chicken.

686
00:48:45,489 --> 00:48:46,820
And that's a Hungry Man!

687
00:48:48,659 --> 00:48:52,661
<i>You know they cut out the Salisbury
Steak Hungry Man last season, so...</i>

688
00:48:52,696 --> 00:48:55,832
When you pass this around, I'd appreciate
it if you'd just hold it by the corners...

689
00:48:55,867 --> 00:48:57,366
...because this one's a keeper.

690
00:48:57,401 --> 00:49:03,829
Um, Shawn? I don't know if you know but
Vince... Well he made a new web site.

691
00:49:04,274 --> 00:49:08,578
Shawn, all I did was have my guys
down at the office just work on it a little bit.

692
00:49:08,613 --> 00:49:10,447
They just tweaked a few things on it.

693
00:49:10,482 --> 00:49:12,247
I just don't really get why we're...

694
00:49:12,282 --> 00:49:16,420
Are we working on the web site now?
That's where our focus is?

695
00:49:16,455 --> 00:49:17,819
<i>Yeah, I know. That's what I was saying.</i>

696
00:49:17,854 --> 00:49:22,025
I don't know why we're dealing with the
web page now. We've got the convention...

697
00:49:22,060 --> 00:49:24,693
<i>Shawn, just look at it. That's all I'm asking.</i>

698
00:49:24,728 --> 00:49:28,598
I'm just saying I don't really see
why we're wasting our time...

699
00:49:28,633 --> 00:49:30,832
Oh, that is so fuckin' cool!

700
00:49:30,867 --> 00:49:35,103
<i>Dude! Oh my God! That is amazing!</i>

701
00:49:35,138 --> 00:49:40,876
<i>You know, this is the kind
of thing that we needed all along.</i>

702
00:49:40,911 --> 00:49:44,039
No, I'm looking for Bob. Well, the show's about
to start here in about fifteen minutes...

703
00:49:45,015 --> 00:49:49,179
<i>Well, I talked to him yesterday and he gave me
every indication that he was going to be here today...</i>

704
00:49:49,720 --> 00:49:51,449
<i>No, we just haven't heard anything...</i>

705
00:49:52,322 --> 00:49:57,954
But, could you at least page him for me? Yeah.
Okay. That would be great. Thanks.

706
00:49:58,829 --> 00:50:02,966
That motherfucker.
Do you think he's really going to blow us off?

707
00:50:03,001 --> 00:50:06,925
If he does, I'm taking it out on your ass today.

708
00:50:10,774 --> 00:50:13,910
<i>Hey! We are The Christers!</i>

709
00:50:13,945 --> 00:50:14,543
<i>(cheering)</i>

710
00:50:14,578 --> 00:50:17,646
<i>(singing) Hey! I got pray! Pray every single day!</i>

711
00:50:17,681 --> 00:50:21,083
<i>I pray for the fat girls that they become skinny girls.</i>

712
00:50:21,118 --> 00:50:25,522
<i>I pray for the pretty girls that they
become my girls and I say- I got pray!</i>

713
00:50:25,557 --> 00:50:28,056
<i>I got to pray! Pray every single day!</i>

714
00:50:28,091 --> 00:50:34,496
<i>I pray for the poor girls that they become rich girls. I
once prayed a homeless girl would get a new house.</i>

715
00:50:35,699 --> 00:50:38,734
<i>Hey! I got to pray! Pray every single day!</i>

716
00:50:38,769 --> 00:50:45,675
<i>Time keeps ticking and these
prayers that I'm kicking are all takin'...</i>

717
00:50:45,710 --> 00:50:52,808
<i>...everybody in this room a little closer to salvation.</i>

718
00:50:54,017 --> 00:50:58,545
<i>Convertin' motherfuckers
all across this holy nation.</i>

719
00:50:59,556 --> 00:51:03,126
<i>Yeah! Hey! I got pray! Pray every single day!</i>

720
00:51:03,161 --> 00:51:06,661
<i>I pray for a new car. I pray to the Superstar.</i>

721
00:51:06,696 --> 00:51:10,767
<i>I pray at the salad bar that they'll have chives.</i>

722
00:51:10,802 --> 00:51:13,869
Hey! I got pray! Pray every single day!

723
00:51:13,904 --> 00:51:18,475
<i>Hey! I got pray!
Pray every single day! Hey! I got pray!</i>

724
00:51:18,510 --> 00:51:23,046
<i>Pray every single day! Hey!
I got to pray! I got to pray!</i>

725
00:51:23,081 --> 00:51:25,682
<i>I got to, got to pray! I got to pray!</i>

726
00:51:25,717 --> 00:51:29,985
<i>(cheering and applause)</i>

727
00:51:30,020 --> 00:51:36,323
Thank you! This next song is about... Jesus.

728
00:51:38,361 --> 00:51:43,278
<i>(singing) Jesus Christ.
You brought your light unto to me.</i>

729
00:51:43,313 --> 00:51:48,196
<i>And your glory dropped me to my knees.
Now I can see.</i>

730
00:51:49,306 --> 00:51:54,608
<i>Jesus Christ. Standing at my window.</i>

731
00:51:55,145 --> 00:51:59,605
<i>You righteousJew - fill the room. I praise you.</i>

732
00:52:01,685 --> 00:52:07,122
<i>You say that you're gay.
But you weren't born that way.</i>

733
00:52:07,157 --> 00:52:12,662
<i>You could swing the other way if you
just took the time to pray.</i>

734
00:52:12,697 --> 00:52:18,567
<i>You know, you should be married
when you pop her cherry.</i>

735
00:52:18,602 --> 00:52:23,972
<i>If you love her you will wait.
Bang her now, you'll seal your fate.</i>

736
00:52:35,585 --> 00:52:42,548
<i>All that you can do is believe. Jesus Christ</i>

737
00:52:46,196 --> 00:52:47,162
Hey!

738
00:52:47,197 --> 00:52:52,157
<i>(cheers and applause)</i>

739
00:52:53,103 --> 00:52:56,869
Let me tell you a little something
about my man, Jesus Christ!

740
00:53:00,343 --> 00:53:03,709
He's still the man of love. He's still the shepherd...

741
00:53:03,744 --> 00:53:07,075
...but he is through fuckin' around with you people.

742
00:53:09,319 --> 00:53:11,753
He's through with your bullshit.

743
00:53:13,156 --> 00:53:18,458
He has had it up to here with your abortions...

744
00:53:18,795 --> 00:53:22,356
...and your homosexuality.

745
00:53:25,835 --> 00:53:33,207
He loves you. He will forgive you but if you
fuck with him, you are going straight to Hell!

746
00:53:33,710 --> 00:53:38,670
Got it!? Yeah! So let's get righteous!

747
00:53:48,992 --> 00:53:53,763
<i>(singing) All that you can do is believe.</i>

748
00:53:53,798 --> 00:53:58,826
<i>Jesus Christ! Jesus Christ!</i>

749
00:53:59,603 --> 00:54:04,040
<i>Ah, ha, ah, haJesus Christ</i>

750
00:54:04,975 --> 00:54:09,844
<i>Jesus Christ! Jesus Christ!</i>

751
00:54:10,814 --> 00:54:15,251
<i>Ah, ha, ah, haJesus Christ</i>

752
00:54:21,424 --> 00:54:25,929
<i>(crowd chants) Christers! Christers! Christers!...</i>

753
00:54:25,964 --> 00:54:27,328
<i>Thank you!</i>

754
00:54:32,936 --> 00:54:35,370
Hey, great gig. Good job.

755
00:54:36,406 --> 00:54:39,509
Good job. That went awesome.
Hey, listen though. "Crown ofThorns."

756
00:54:39,544 --> 00:54:42,446
After the second verse, you're still
not hitting that fill. Okay?

757
00:54:42,481 --> 00:54:45,348
- I didn't...
- Hey, just don't respond. Just work on it okay?

758
00:54:45,383 --> 00:54:46,212
Good job, man.

759
00:54:46,616 --> 00:54:50,118
Al. We pulled it off. I think we did.

760
00:54:50,153 --> 00:54:54,924
I'll tell you something else. I think we've got a big,
fat fucking Christian record deal in our future.

761
00:54:54,959 --> 00:54:57,859
That guy was loving our shit tonight.

762
00:54:57,894 --> 00:55:01,398
Did you see Vince? Making a
big production of how he's got to leave early.

763
00:55:01,433 --> 00:55:03,765
How he can't stay and see the show. Whatever.

764
00:55:03,800 --> 00:55:10,137
I will say this for the guy though. That web
site that he cooked up for us; that thing rocked.

765
00:55:11,508 --> 00:55:15,410
What is with you? It was our big deal.

766
00:55:15,445 --> 00:55:18,081
We had an awesome show.
What!? What's your problem?

767
00:55:18,116 --> 00:55:20,717
Dude, it's not the show.
We had a great show, okay?

768
00:55:20,752 --> 00:55:23,185
Didn't you see her face?

769
00:55:24,187 --> 00:55:25,387
Who's face?

770
00:55:25,422 --> 00:55:27,807
Shelly's face. About the web site?

771
00:55:27,842 --> 00:55:30,158
The web site thing? Seriously?

772
00:55:30,193 --> 00:55:32,193
- Yeah!
- Oh my God. She'll get over it, A.

773
00:55:32,228 --> 00:55:36,766
Relax. God damn.
Hey, you didn't even look at his site.

774
00:55:36,801 --> 00:55:38,902
- I didn't have to.
- It's not even close.

775
00:55:38,937 --> 00:55:40,435
<i>I mean, it was so much cooler.</i>

776
00:55:40,470 --> 00:55:43,171
That's just out of line. Shame on those people.

777
00:55:43,206 --> 00:55:46,843
They didn't even give a chance for Shelly's web site.
I mean... man!

778
00:55:46,878 --> 00:55:51,181
Ooooh! Oooohhh!

779
00:55:51,216 --> 00:55:52,480
What?

780
00:55:52,515 --> 00:55:53,516
You want to fuck her.

781
00:55:53,551 --> 00:55:55,817
Oh, man. Stop.

782
00:55:55,852 --> 00:55:57,652
- You do!
- No, I don't.

783
00:55:57,687 --> 00:56:04,127
Oh my God! This is just like Lauren
Cavanaugh in the eleventh grade.

784
00:56:04,162 --> 00:56:09,431
Oh my God! You totally want
to fuck her! That's hilarious.

785
00:56:09,466 --> 00:56:14,671
A, she's nasty. But, whatever. If that's
what you're into, that's cool.

786
00:56:14,706 --> 00:56:18,108
Me and Shelly are good friends, okay?
I care a lot about her.

787
00:56:18,143 --> 00:56:21,476
I'm just... She got her feelings hurt tonight.

788
00:56:21,511 --> 00:56:25,365
A, just say it. Just say it.
Just say, "I wanna fuck her."

789
00:56:25,400 --> 00:56:29,184
- Just stop, man.
- I wanna give her my slippery chicken!

790
00:56:29,219 --> 00:56:34,824
I wanna get in behind and do the RearAdmiral!
Yeah! Wooo! Yeah! Say it!

791
00:56:34,859 --> 00:56:36,827
- Dude, just listen, okay?
- Listen, okay?

792
00:56:36,862 --> 00:56:38,760
<i>- Just stop.
(Shawn repeats) - Just stop.</i>

793
00:56:38,795 --> 00:56:40,194
<i>Just listen to me for once.
(Shawn repeats Al.)</i>

794
00:56:41,097 --> 00:56:42,597
<i>All I'm saying.
(Shawn repeats Al.)</i>

795
00:56:42,632 --> 00:56:43,898
<i>Al I'm trying to say is...
(Shawn repeats Al.)</i>

796
00:56:43,933 --> 00:56:45,100
<i>You were a little inconsiderate...
(Shawn repeats Al.)</i>

797
00:56:45,135 --> 00:56:47,036
<i>...and you could have been a little nicer.
(Shawn repeats Al.)</i>

798
00:56:47,071 --> 00:56:49,406
<i>Dude, are we in the tenth grade?
(Shawn repeats Al.)</i>

799
00:56:49,441 --> 00:56:52,170
Fuckin' Shawn! God damn it!

800
00:56:53,843 --> 00:56:58,678
A! Al, come on! Seriously!

801
00:57:06,856 --> 00:57:08,958
<i>(filmmaker) Think you were a little hard on him?</i>

802
00:57:08,993 --> 00:57:10,193
Think you were a little hard on him?

803
00:57:10,228 --> 00:57:11,126
<i>- Dude.
- Dude.</i>

804
00:57:11,161 --> 00:57:13,261
<i>- Don't even start that shit.
- Don't even start that shit.</i>

805
00:57:13,296 --> 00:57:15,432
<i>- I'll turn this fucking camera around.
I'll turn this fucking camera around.</i>

806
00:57:19,469 --> 00:57:21,232
Hey, baby.

807
00:57:24,741 --> 00:57:28,676
Hello? Shawn?

808
00:57:28,711 --> 00:57:30,076
<i>I'm in the bathroom.</i>

809
00:57:37,520 --> 00:57:39,215
What the fuck are you doing?

810
00:57:39,889 --> 00:57:41,991
<i>I'm pissing in my shampoo.
What does it look like?</i>

811
00:57:42,026 --> 00:57:43,583
What the fuck Shawn!?

812
00:57:44,661 --> 00:57:47,459
It's for Chris! He's driving me fucking nuts!

813
00:57:48,198 --> 00:57:50,865
He's eating all my food.
He's making a fucking mess.

814
00:57:50,900 --> 00:57:54,370
<i>He runs the air conditioner all
day long and leaves the door open.</i>

815
00:57:54,405 --> 00:57:57,106
<i>And now he's calling those 900 number sex lines...</i>

816
00:57:57,141 --> 00:57:58,706
...and he's fucking deaf!

817
00:57:58,741 --> 00:58:01,961
And now he's using my shampoo
and this shit is expensive.

818
00:58:01,996 --> 00:58:05,181
The next time he does, he's in for a fucking surprise.

819
00:58:05,216 --> 00:58:07,046
What, are you in high school now!?

820
00:58:07,750 --> 00:58:11,221
Anyway... Look, we need to talk.

821
00:58:11,256 --> 00:58:12,790
<i>(pee sounds)</i>

822
00:58:12,825 --> 00:58:14,289
<i>So talk then.</i>

823
00:58:14,324 --> 00:58:16,558
<i>- Oh, my God!
- What!?</i>

824
00:58:16,593 --> 00:58:18,928
I just saw the gobbler.
You know I don't like that.

825
00:58:18,963 --> 00:58:21,963
<i>- Jesus Christ. Anyway!
- Anyway!</i>

826
00:58:21,998 --> 00:58:24,796
I got pulled over on my way
home from work last night.

827
00:58:25,101 --> 00:58:26,301
<i>Okay, and?</i>

828
00:58:26,336 --> 00:58:30,773
And, the officer that pulled me over was searching
my car for drugs and alcohol and stuff...

829
00:58:30,808 --> 00:58:34,470
...and we got to talking and it
turns out his name is Dwayne.

830
00:58:35,712 --> 00:58:38,147
His name is Dwayne?

831
00:58:38,182 --> 00:58:39,647
Well, yeah.

832
00:58:39,682 --> 00:58:42,318
And did Dwayne
give you a ticket?

833
00:58:42,353 --> 00:58:44,986
No, but we did start talking.

834
00:58:45,021 --> 00:58:49,082
It turns out he went to sunny slope high and
played football with my brother and stuff.

835
00:58:49,926 --> 00:58:53,795
He's just really good looking
and works out and has a great job.

836
00:58:53,830 --> 00:58:58,392
He really has his life together. He just seems
like so much more of an adult than you.

837
00:58:58,801 --> 00:59:01,135
I have a job. I work part time.

838
00:59:01,170 --> 00:59:05,406
Yeah, whatever. I'm just sick of all this craziness.

839
00:59:05,441 --> 00:59:09,279
I'm sick of the freezers and the stupid
Christian rock. I'm just... I'm done with it.

840
00:59:09,314 --> 00:59:13,306
I don't want you to call me. I don't want
to be friends. I'm just leaving!

841
00:59:16,286 --> 00:59:18,720
Well, did he give you a warning at least?

842
00:59:19,122 --> 00:59:21,113
You want a wiener?

843
00:59:24,360 --> 00:59:28,464
I had to get rid of the frozen entrees.
I just couldn't justify the expense.

844
00:59:28,499 --> 00:59:31,099
Eight thousand dollars for a refrigerated showcase.

845
00:59:31,134 --> 00:59:34,501
I just couldn't justify it.
I couldn't sell enough frozen entrees.

846
00:59:35,438 --> 00:59:38,374
<i>Look, I just think this is a really bad idea.
That's what I'm saying.</i>

847
00:59:38,409 --> 00:59:40,375
Shawn, what is your concern?

848
00:59:40,410 --> 00:59:44,479
<i>My concern is that we're all equal
members of this club, Vince...</i>

849
00:59:44,514 --> 00:59:48,216
...and we should all contribute an equal
amount of cash to the convention.

850
00:59:48,251 --> 00:59:53,712
<i>Okay, let's say we go by that. Then we have
to go by the poorest member of the club.</i>

851
00:59:54,057 --> 00:59:56,691
Which, in this club, would be... you.

852
00:59:56,726 --> 01:00:00,321
So, we have a fund raiser.
What's the big fucking deal?

853
01:00:00,964 --> 01:00:02,865
Yeah, we could have a car wash.

854
01:00:02,900 --> 01:00:03,965
A car wash!?

855
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:06,803
Do you know how many fucking cars you gotta
wash to come up with that kind of money?

856
01:00:06,838 --> 01:00:09,571
Vince. It's a good idea. Okay? Just relax.

857
01:00:09,606 --> 01:00:12,675
Okay, everyone needs to settle down.
This is a club for fun.

858
01:00:12,710 --> 01:00:15,243
Let's support each other. It's a good family, here.

859
01:00:15,278 --> 01:00:19,982
Look, all I'm saying is that I have the money.
I can afford it and I want to help the club.

860
01:00:20,017 --> 01:00:24,687
LookVince, we've been over this and over this
and it's not going to fucking go down that way.

861
01:00:24,722 --> 01:00:28,542
So just end of fucking story, okay!?

862
01:00:28,577 --> 01:00:32,327
What!? End of story!? Come on man! No!

863
01:00:32,362 --> 01:00:36,599
You don't speak for the whole group during a
meeting! I want to hear what he has to says.

864
01:00:36,634 --> 01:00:40,837
Don't you see what he's trying to do? He's trying
to buy the fucking club out from under us.

865
01:00:40,872 --> 01:00:43,740
Jesus Christ Shawn!
I'm not trying to buy the fucking club!

866
01:00:43,775 --> 01:00:44,839
<i>Oh, bullshit!</i>

867
01:00:44,874 --> 01:00:47,176
Al I'm saying is we have one chance
to get this thing done right!

868
01:00:47,211 --> 01:00:49,544
I have the money to put up
to make sure it gets done right!

869
01:00:49,579 --> 01:00:53,049
If it doesn't, it could be the beginning of
the end of frozen entree collecting!

870
01:00:53,084 --> 01:00:55,752
Shawn, I've got a lot of money
invested in my collection...

871
01:00:55,787 --> 01:00:58,188
<i>...and I want to take this thing to the next level!</i>

872
01:00:58,223 --> 01:01:00,555
It's all about the fucking money with this guy.

873
01:01:00,590 --> 01:01:03,493
<i>Just watch! You let him put up
the money for the fucking convention...</i>

874
01:01:03,528 --> 01:01:06,928
...and then it's going to be
Vince's fucking Frozen Entree Club!

875
01:01:06,963 --> 01:01:10,900
<i>He's gonna be giving us orders and we're
all gonna be jumping through his fucking hoops!</i>

876
01:01:10,935 --> 01:01:12,869
<i>He's gonna be running the fucking show!</i>

877
01:01:12,904 --> 01:01:14,102
<i>Well, you know what? Fuck you!</i>

878
01:01:14,137 --> 01:01:18,708
<i>You've been nothing but a pain in my ass since you
showed up with your poser, pussy fucking collection!</i>

879
01:01:18,743 --> 01:01:21,978
<i>Well, I'm fucking out of here, man!
Fuck you! And fuck you too!</i>

880
01:01:22,013 --> 01:01:24,310
And fuck the rest of you fucking dicks!

881
01:01:26,215 --> 01:01:29,082
And your door is a piece of fucking shit, man!

882
01:01:39,996 --> 01:01:44,956
<i>(trickling sound)</i>

883
01:01:55,812 --> 01:02:01,648
Um... One of you guys...
I'm going to need a ride home.

884
01:02:03,686 --> 01:02:06,421
<i>It's all about the people...</i>

885
01:02:06,456 --> 01:02:09,859
I've been saying all along -
It's all about just getting the people together.

886
01:02:09,894 --> 01:02:12,927
Casino! Diesel!

887
01:02:12,962 --> 01:02:16,398
You see, the frozen entrees are our common
ground. They're our common interest...

888
01:02:16,933 --> 01:02:24,738
...but they mean nothing to us unless they unify.
Unless they bring us together.

889
01:02:26,109 --> 01:02:31,646
Oooh, Enter! Fireworks!
Fireworks? Ahhh.

890
01:02:31,681 --> 01:02:34,878
See, once you give that frozen
entree the power to divide...

891
01:02:36,652 --> 01:02:41,612
...you're in big, big trouble my friend. Huge.

892
01:02:48,464 --> 01:02:50,064
<i>I'm actually worried about Shawn.</i>

893
01:02:50,099 --> 01:02:54,469
He has some prior drug use and
I don't want him to relapse.

894
01:02:54,504 --> 01:02:59,008
I think he's hurting inside. Right here.
I just don't want him to relapse.

895
01:02:59,043 --> 01:03:00,508
<i>(filmmaker) Are the members taking sides?</i>

896
01:03:00,543 --> 01:03:04,647
Yeah. Some of us have.
We're quite fractioned actually.

897
01:03:04,682 --> 01:03:06,981
I'm doing what I can. I'm making some calls.

898
01:03:07,016 --> 01:03:11,009
I'm trying to keep the group together
but it's just really not easy.

899
01:03:16,459 --> 01:03:21,464
A, I don't even know why you tell me this shit.
You know exactly what I'm going to say.

900
01:03:21,499 --> 01:03:23,728
I know. I know, but...

901
01:03:25,134 --> 01:03:28,738
- Listen, if this girl means that much to you...
- She does. She means a lot.

902
01:03:28,773 --> 01:03:32,006
<i>You gotta go get her.
You gotta tell her right now.</i>

903
01:03:32,041 --> 01:03:36,712
You have a chance. I've seen this girl.
She's in your league.

904
01:03:36,747 --> 01:03:38,543
She's nothing to write home about.

905
01:03:40,650 --> 01:03:44,852
I've got it under control Chuck.
I appreciate it but, you know...

906
01:03:44,887 --> 01:03:49,324
Listen! You don't have it under control.
Here, this is easy to figure out...

907
01:03:50,059 --> 01:03:53,294
<i>Shawn got dumped. She's got a crush on Shawn.</i>

908
01:03:53,329 --> 01:03:57,700
Is she still going to be your little princess
after he's banged the shit out of her?

909
01:03:57,735 --> 01:04:01,335
Chuck, don't say that. Shelly's not that way.

910
01:04:01,370 --> 01:04:05,608
She works at an abstinence center.
She's really religious. She's just not that way.

911
01:04:05,643 --> 01:04:09,510
Al, they're all that way.
Dad, would you tell him, please?

912
01:04:11,113 --> 01:04:12,444
They're all whores Al.

913
01:04:13,616 --> 01:04:14,776
<i>Fuckin'A, AI.</i>

914
01:04:15,351 --> 01:04:21,224
Put down the fucking Ding Dong, get off your ass
and go tell this girl how you feel about her.

915
01:04:21,259 --> 01:04:23,556
For once in your life, be a man.

916
01:04:26,495 --> 01:04:29,259
Dad, can I borrow the car?

917
01:04:30,199 --> 01:04:33,225

01:05:06,302 --> 01:05:08,237
Did you walk all the way from the bus stop?

924
01:05:08,272 --> 01:05:12,071
Um, no. No, I didn't. You look great.

925
01:05:12,508 --> 01:05:13,841
Thank you.

926
01:05:13,876 --> 01:05:15,478
You're like all smiley.

927
01:05:15,513 --> 01:05:17,309
I'm smiley.

928
01:05:19,248 --> 01:05:23,252
So, I want to tell you
something that uh...

929
01:05:23,287 --> 01:05:24,879
I wanted to talk
to you about.

930
01:05:25,388 --> 01:05:27,523
I wanted to tell you
something too.

931
01:05:27,558 --> 01:05:29,548
I'm glad you
showed up.

932
01:05:33,162 --> 01:05:34,686
<i>That's Shawn's necklace.</i>

933
01:05:35,831 --> 01:05:37,321
Why are you wearing Shawn's necklace?

934
01:05:39,435 --> 01:05:40,595
We did it.

935
01:05:41,737 --> 01:05:44,638
You did it? Did what?

936
01:05:44,774 --> 01:05:47,209
<i>- It!
- It? What happened?</i>

937
01:05:47,244 --> 01:05:48,506
The big it!

938
01:05:50,579 --> 01:05:53,673
You? With Shawn!?

939
01:05:56,986 --> 01:06:02,992
No, don't look like that, because it was great.
It was really natural. It was fine.

940
01:06:03,027 --> 01:06:06,758
<i>He was really upset He needed
a ride so I gave him a ride home.</i>

941
01:06:08,130 --> 01:06:10,765
<i>- It happened so fast.
- This happened the other night?</i>

942
01:06:10,800 --> 01:06:15,604
Yeah. And I was so nervous but he was so
sweet and he just kept talking to me.

943
01:06:15,639 --> 01:06:19,909
He wasn't just being friendly, it
was more. And I didn't know like...

944
01:06:19,944 --> 01:06:23,212
I knew his skin looked
good but it's really soft.

945
01:06:23,247 --> 01:06:25,665
- It's smooth. Like the back... - Shelly!

946
01:06:25,700 --> 01:06:28,049
No! You've been talking
about marriage.

947
01:06:28,084 --> 01:06:30,152
"I'm not going to do this
until I get married."

948
01:06:30,187 --> 01:06:32,279
I know. I know we're not married yet.

949
01:06:33,990 --> 01:06:37,326
<i>You work at an intercourse
prevention hot-line service, okay?</i>

950
01:06:37,361 --> 01:06:39,627
How contradictory is that?

951
01:06:39,662 --> 01:06:44,966
Oh... Yeah...
I thought about that this morning.

952
01:06:45,001 --> 01:06:49,705
And the thing is, I think the Lord... I know
the Lord would forgive it because it's love.

953
01:06:49,740 --> 01:06:53,843
<i>- If it's love it's okay.
- It's not love, Shelly! It's not love!</i>

954
01:06:53,878 --> 01:06:56,944
I mean, you guys aren't seeing each other.

955
01:06:56,979 --> 01:07:00,883
Don't think anything is going to come of this
because nothing isn't going to come of this.

956
01:07:00,918 --> 01:07:04,187
<i>- How do you know, A?
- I know. I know Shawn. I'm sorry Shelly.</i>

957
01:07:04,222 --> 01:07:07,456
You don't know him the way I do.
I spent a whole night with him.

958
01:07:07,491 --> 01:07:09,287
Al, you don't know.

959
01:07:10,659 --> 01:07:15,097
Yes I do. You were laid.
You got screwed the other night. Okay?

960
01:07:15,132 --> 01:07:17,666
It wasn't love.
You're not going to get mamied!

961
01:07:17,701 --> 01:07:19,033
You don't know what you're talking about.

962
01:07:19,068 --> 01:07:21,628
My fucking brother was right!
I can't believe this!

963
01:07:21,904 --> 01:07:25,135
I don't even want to know what
that means. I'm leaving. Goodbye.

964
01:07:25,207 --> 01:07:27,141
Shelly. Sit back down. Shelly.

965
01:07:33,149 --> 01:07:36,684
Listen up everybody!
This is my beautiful girl, Toni!

966
01:07:36,719 --> 01:07:41,679
Help me out here guys. Baby, I love you
with all my heart. Will you marry me?

967
01:07:43,325 --> 01:07:44,593
Yes! Yes! She said yes!

968
01:07:44,628 --> 01:07:47,696
<i>(crowd applauds)</i>

969
01:07:47,731 --> 01:07:50,764
<i>(crowd applauds)</i>

970
01:07:51,300 --> 01:07:56,260
<i>(music: "Hang" by The Mojo Monkeys)</i>

971
01:08:31,240 --> 01:08:33,731
Hey Baby, want a piece of this?

972
01:08:34,243 --> 01:08:38,612
Hey baby, what's up!? Ten bucks! Date
with you tonight! You and me!

973
01:08:39,915 --> 01:08:43,646
What the fuck are you looking at?
Beat it.

974
01:08:51,260 --> 01:08:54,596
<i>(Here's another secret message for our deaf pals...)</i>

975
01:08:54,631 --> 01:08:57,898
<i>(I wish you could hear this song. It's really great!)</i>

976
01:08:57,933 --> 01:09:02,304
<i>(The vibrations of this song probablly don't feel that
much different than a lot of really shitty songs...)</i>

977
01:09:02,339 --> 01:09:07,309
<i>(But, if you could hear this song, you'd be all
like,"Holy shit dude, this song kicks ass!")</i>

978
01:09:07,344 --> 01:09:12,279
<i>(Anyway, it's a really good song. It's kind
of sad. It makes me feel bad for Al...)</i>

979
01:09:12,314 --> 01:09:17,274
<i>(He seems like such a nice guy. Oh, well...
We'd better get back to the movie now, eh?)</i>

980
01:09:45,147 --> 01:09:46,013
Here's the story.

981
01:09:46,048 --> 01:09:50,419
For the past couple of days we've been telling
you about this frozen food entree fiasco.

982
01:09:50,454 --> 01:09:53,921
Now, I saw, two weeks ago,
in the "AboutTown" rag -

983
01:09:53,956 --> 01:09:56,525
I was looking to find out when Bang
Tango would be coming to town...

984
01:09:56,560 --> 01:09:58,127
...because I haven't been
bored in a while.

985
01:09:58,162 --> 01:10:00,162
Whoa! You are a wild man!

986
01:10:00,197 --> 01:10:01,061
You can't stop me!

987
01:10:01,096 --> 01:10:04,716
I saw that there was an ad
for a frozen food convention.

988
01:10:04,751 --> 01:10:08,337
<i>Then, the following week,
I see that there's two ads.</i>

989
01:10:08,372 --> 01:10:10,271
<i>There's a big ad and then there's a little ad.</i>

990
01:10:10,306 --> 01:10:14,343
So, what I'm figuring out is - these two guys,
Shawn andVince, they've split up.

991
01:10:14,378 --> 01:10:15,342
They've gone their separate ways.

992
01:10:15,377 --> 01:10:17,613
One guy's having a big convention, the
other guy's having a small convention.

993
01:10:17,648 --> 01:10:20,282
I don't think anyone's going.
Who's going to go? No one's going to go.

994
01:10:20,317 --> 01:10:23,217
That's too many conventions
of frozen food for one town.

995
01:10:23,252 --> 01:10:27,223
We're going to have those guys in here
and we're going to solve that problem.

996
01:10:27,258 --> 01:10:30,059
Because I don't like it. That's too
many conventions of frozen food...

997
01:10:30,094 --> 01:10:33,229
The thrilling frozen food war.
I can hardly wait.

998
01:10:33,264 --> 01:10:35,390
We'll be right back after this.

999
01:10:36,265 --> 01:10:40,769
<i>I don't know what's gotten into Al. I don't
think he's really happy about what happened.</i>

1000
01:10:40,804 --> 01:10:42,862
Even though I'm really happy, of course.

1001
01:10:43,739 --> 01:10:49,177
I don't know - maybe it's because we always talked
about who was going to lose their virginity first.

1002
01:10:49,945 --> 01:10:54,245
I don't think he thought it was going to be me.
I didn't think it was going to be me.

1003
01:10:54,683 --> 01:10:58,813
But I didn't know I was going to fall in
love either so... You just never know.

1004
01:11:00,289 --> 01:11:05,761
Anyway, I hope he comes around. Now that
I have a boyfriend, things are a lot different.

1005
01:11:05,796 --> 01:11:08,964
<i>There's not going to be as much time for...
(beep!)</i>

1006
01:11:08,999 --> 01:11:13,128
Yes? Yes, hello. My name is Shelly...

1007
01:11:16,505 --> 01:11:20,532
Oh, really? You are?

1008
01:11:22,444 --> 01:11:24,745
Ooohhh... are there candles?

1009
01:11:24,780 --> 01:11:28,282
I 06.9 Stan and Dan
in the morning!

1010
01:11:28,317 --> 01:11:30,219
Well everybody, they're
finally here. That's right.

1011
01:11:30,254 --> 01:11:32,687
The frozen food
enthusiasts are both here.

1012
01:11:32,788 --> 01:11:36,692
<i>These guys have a feud going on. They've got
two conventions going on in town this weekend.</i>

1013
01:11:36,727 --> 01:11:38,192
<i>- This is big! - Big news!</i>

1014
01:11:38,227 --> 01:11:39,860
We're going to help figure
this out for these guys...

1015
01:11:39,895 --> 01:11:41,764
...because there can't be two
conventions fellas, I'm sorry.

1016
01:11:41,799 --> 01:11:43,299
Before we go any further...

1017
01:11:43,334 --> 01:11:44,465
That's crazy!

1018
01:11:44,500 --> 01:11:45,933
Shawn - why are you
wearing the Kock-head?

1019
01:11:45,968 --> 01:11:48,203
<i>- I thought I was supposed to.
- That's for fist time guests only.</i>

1020
01:11:48,238 --> 01:11:49,192
<i>You look like a jackass.</i>

1021
01:11:49,972 --> 01:11:53,042
What would it take to get you guys back together?
I need to see a healing take place.

1022
01:11:53,077 --> 01:11:57,244
<i>What if I said that l06.9The Rooster...
(rooster sound)</i>

1023
01:11:57,279 --> 01:12:01,016
...was going to sponsor you and give you
the convention hall this weekend?

1024
01:12:01,051 --> 01:12:03,484
Then, what if I also said that
the good folks at Frigidaire...

1025
01:12:03,519 --> 01:12:08,155
...were willing to bring down some
freezers to help you with your frozen treats.

1026
01:12:08,190 --> 01:12:11,960
<i>The good folks at Frigidaire - you know what
their slogan is, "don't let the kids play in there!"</i>

1027
01:12:11,995 --> 01:12:13,587
That's a good rule of thumb - eh Dan?

1028
01:12:14,163 --> 01:12:17,031
You know it! Big thumbs up from Dan!

1029
01:12:17,066 --> 01:12:21,170
Aso, the folks at Dickman Meatpie - the meatpie
to have when you're having more than one.

1030
01:12:21,205 --> 01:12:22,336
<i>(singing) Make mine a Dickmans.</i>

1031
01:12:22,371 --> 01:12:26,442
All of us get together and let you guys have
one convention at the convention center.

1032
01:12:26,477 --> 01:12:27,807
How's that sound? Would you do it?

1033
01:12:28,243 --> 01:12:30,045
<i>- Yeah, that'd be great.
- Wouldn't that be great!?</i>

1034
01:12:30,080 --> 01:12:31,145
Yeah, I'd do that.

1035
01:12:31,180 --> 01:12:33,661
<i>Let there be a healing everybody!
L06.9 KOCK, The Rooster!</i>

1036
01:12:33,696 --> 01:12:36,143
<i>Let there be a healing everybody!
L06.9 KOCK, The Rooster!</i>

1037
01:12:36,518 --> 01:12:42,441
Okay, I've got the plans for the convention.
This is what we've got here.

1038
01:12:42,476 --> 01:12:48,329
Okay, the lobby - this is where the
buses are going to drop everyone off.

1039
01:12:48,364 --> 01:12:52,266
We've got a pathway going through this section
here that leads to thevegetable Medley Pavilion.

1040
01:12:52,434 --> 01:12:57,005
<i>Right along either side, we've got some really
sweet display coolers coming in from Canada.</i>

1041
01:12:57,040 --> 01:12:59,940
Great place to display some of my stuff.

1042
01:12:59,975 --> 01:13:03,746
<i>(different group members:)
Shelly! Wow! Hey, Nice!</i>

1043
01:13:03,781 --> 01:13:06,747
Thank you. Hi Shawn.

1044
01:13:06,782 --> 01:13:10,946
Oh... Hey, how are you doing. Anyway, um...

1045
01:13:11,754 --> 01:13:16,919
As far as the elevator access, I think we're good
there. We've got plenty of room into the...

1046
01:13:17,826 --> 01:13:20,928
Hey! Hey! How you doing there, sport?

1047
01:13:20,963 --> 01:13:26,492
Hey, you've got my necklace! You found it!
Awesome! I was totally looking for that.

1048
01:13:27,636 --> 01:13:30,628
- Do you want it now?
- Well, I think I need it.

1049
01:13:35,978 --> 01:13:40,244
Okay, on the topic of terrorism,
which I think we have to address.

1050
01:13:41,283 --> 01:13:43,618
Let's face it, there's some
people back in the holy land...

1051
01:13:43,653 --> 01:13:45,954
that would like to see this
convention not happen. Okay?

1052
01:13:45,989 --> 01:13:49,390
I think we'd be crazy if we didn't address that.

1053
01:13:49,825 --> 01:13:53,328
I think we could talk to the local police
department, the local fire department.

1054
01:13:53,363 --> 01:13:55,023
Maybe they could roll some extra squads.

1055
01:13:55,397 --> 01:13:58,594
Just send them our way periodically
throughout the convention...

1056
01:14:00,402 --> 01:14:04,271
Everybody involved - be on a
level orange all the time.

1057
01:14:04,306 --> 01:14:07,075
<i>Here's an issue we're going to
have to deal with at some point...</i>

1058
01:14:07,110 --> 01:14:09,845
<i>As near as I can tell this is not
actually wheelchair accessible.</i>

1059
01:14:09,880 --> 01:14:11,278
<i>I don't know if
that's a big deal.</i>

1060
01:14:11,313 --> 01:14:13,615
<i>I don't know if we're going to
have a lot of cripples at this thing.</i>

1061
01:14:13,650 --> 01:14:15,879
<i>Yeah, it's fine - fuck 'em.</i>

1062
01:14:20,656 --> 01:14:22,456
Hey, listen Shelly...

1063
01:14:22,491 --> 01:14:24,288
Look A, okay. You were right.

1064
01:14:25,093 --> 01:14:28,654
I don't want to hear about it.
I really just want to be left alone.

1065
01:14:31,066 --> 01:14:34,281
Listen. This isn't
about I told you so...

1066
01:14:34,316 --> 01:14:37,496
...even though I did.
It's not about that.

1067
01:14:38,307 --> 01:14:43,335
Listen, the other night I said
some things that I regret.

1068
01:14:44,146 --> 01:14:46,808
But I said it in haste okay.

1069
01:14:48,617 --> 01:14:50,385
You mean so much to me...

1070
01:14:50,420 --> 01:14:51,943
What's up guys?

1071
01:14:52,287 --> 01:14:53,185
Hey Chris.

1072
01:14:53,922 --> 01:14:55,355
Want a smoke?

1073
01:14:56,225 --> 01:14:57,214
Yeah.

1074
01:14:58,093 --> 01:14:59,617
Smoke?

1075
01:15:11,173 --> 01:15:13,403
What's her fucking problem?

1076
01:15:14,510 --> 01:15:15,772
Dude!

1077
01:15:16,245 --> 01:15:18,545
Chris! Do you...

1078
01:15:18,580 --> 01:15:20,582
What the hell is
wrong with you!?

1079
01:15:20,617 --> 01:15:22,072
Fuck youAI.

1080
01:15:25,387 --> 01:15:28,957
<i>(radio announcer:)
Why did Stan and Dan cross the road?</i>

1081
01:15:28,992 --> 01:15:30,491
<i>To get to the KOCK!</i>

1082
01:15:30,526 --> 01:15:32,159
<i>(Stan:)
Today's the big day if you like freaks!...</i>

1083
01:15:32,194 --> 01:15:35,030
<i>...Get on down to the
frozen entree enthusiasts convention...</i>

1084
01:15:35,065 --> 01:15:37,731
<i>...One o'clock, downtown convention center...</i>

1085
01:15:37,766 --> 01:15:41,634
<i>...Brought to you by your friends at KOCK,
Frigidaire and Dickman Meatpie.</i>

1086
01:15:42,604 --> 01:15:46,540
Whoa, whoa! Okay, you need this?
It's empty? I'm going to take this okay?

1087
01:15:46,575 --> 01:15:51,035
Listen, that goes with the projection system over
at the Smoked Meats of the World Pavilion.

1088
01:15:51,413 --> 01:15:57,249
So, just take it over to bay l7. There's a security
guy over there. Get a purple pass from him.

1089
01:15:57,319 --> 01:16:00,222
Alright? You don't have a purple pass,
you're not going to get that shit anywhere.

1090
01:16:00,257 --> 01:16:01,883
Okay, get lost - we've got a lot to do today.

1091
01:16:04,526 --> 01:16:07,017
I got you that box you wanted
for that shit you brought.

1092
01:16:09,565 --> 01:16:12,864
I got you the box. It's a sweet box.

1093
01:16:13,936 --> 01:16:15,494
Dude, what the fuck's your problem?

1094
01:16:16,772 --> 01:16:22,768
It's going awesome. The radio ads,
the people are coming, what!?

1095
01:16:23,245 --> 01:16:24,545
Dude, this is all a joke.

1096
01:16:24,580 --> 01:16:27,105
Oh, man, you are just never fucking happy.

1097
01:16:27,649 --> 01:16:32,387
Dude, the only reason why people are coming
out to this freak show is to laugh at us.

1098
01:16:32,422 --> 01:16:36,325
Okay, A: Bullshit.
B: Even if that were true, the fuck do you care?

1099
01:16:36,360 --> 01:16:40,228
As long as they show up, buy
fucking a t-shirt, pay at the door.

1100
01:16:40,263 --> 01:16:41,889
Who cares why they're coming.

1101
01:16:42,998 --> 01:16:47,568
Dude, I'm tired of being laughed at.
Okay? I'm tired of it.

1102
01:16:47,603 --> 01:16:53,166
You're tired of being laughed at?
You're a clown A. I mean, come on. Really.

1103
01:16:53,642 --> 01:16:54,836
Not anymore.

1104
01:16:55,110 --> 01:16:58,981
A, why do you care so much about
what people think of you all the time?

1105
01:16:59,016 --> 01:17:01,481
You've got to get over that shit.
Seriously, it's not healthy.

1106
01:17:01,516 --> 01:17:04,720
Shawn, if I gave a shit about any of this,
I wouldn't care what people think.

1107
01:17:04,755 --> 01:17:06,388
I'd suck it up because I believed in it.

1108
01:17:06,423 --> 01:17:07,421
Oh, so you don't care?

1109
01:17:07,456 --> 01:17:08,855
No, I don't care about this.

1110
01:17:09,658 --> 01:17:11,660
Well, is there anything you
do fucking care about, AI?

1111
01:17:11,695 --> 01:17:14,029
Yeah, I cared about the band.
Remember the band?

1112
01:17:14,064 --> 01:17:16,430
The old band? Not
the Christers crap.

1113
01:17:16,465 --> 01:17:18,967
Jesus! What the hell were you
thinking about!? Christian punk!?

1114
01:17:19,002 --> 01:17:21,637
That was a good idea.
And it's working.

1115
01:17:21,672 --> 01:17:24,237
No it wasn't. We didn't
have to do that!

1116
01:17:24,272 --> 01:17:26,941
We were on the right track.
You just get so impatient.

1117
01:17:26,976 --> 01:17:29,611
If it's not going good for
you, you just up and run.

1118
01:17:29,646 --> 01:17:31,411
Dude! We're not
even that religious!

1119
01:17:31,446 --> 01:17:35,183
Fuck you,A. You may not have
any spiritual fucking compass...

1120
01:17:35,218 --> 01:17:37,019
but I've got faith up the
ass if you'll check it.

1121
01:17:37,054 --> 01:17:38,185
- Bullshit!
- You can check it!

1122
01:17:38,220 --> 01:17:40,822
<i>You are so full of shit! You'll say
anything if it gets you what you want!</i>

1123
01:17:40,857 --> 01:17:43,313
Yeah, so you never get what you
want. So who's better off?

1124
01:17:43,825 --> 01:17:45,425
You never get what you want.

1125
01:17:45,460 --> 01:17:49,196
Okay, you may be right on that,
dude, but you know what?

1126
01:17:49,231 --> 01:17:54,236
I can't sell out. I can't wake up in the
morning and look at myself in the mirror.

1127
01:17:54,271 --> 01:17:56,636
<i>(repeating) I can't wake up and
look at myselfin the mirror.</i>

1128
01:17:56,972 --> 01:17:58,573
- You know where I'm going with this.
- You know where I'm going with this.

1129
01:17:58,608 --> 01:18:01,208
<i>Shut up! Just shut up!
(Shawn repeats)</i>

1130
01:18:01,243 --> 01:18:03,577
<i>Man, do you know how old you are!?
(Shawn repeats)</i>

1131
01:18:03,612 --> 01:18:06,479
God damn it! I'm so fucking
fed up with this shit, Shawn!

1132
01:18:06,848 --> 01:18:09,249
Fuck you! Fuck yourTV dinners!

1133
01:18:09,284 --> 01:18:11,651
And you know what - Fuck Jesus!

1134
01:18:13,188 --> 01:18:15,952
Hey! Whoa, whoa, whoa!

1135
01:18:16,324 --> 01:18:18,019
Fuck me!?

1136
01:18:29,204 --> 01:18:31,905
<i>The convention was a great success.</i>

1137
01:18:31,940 --> 01:18:38,311
<i>As a matter of fact thevegetable Medley Pavilion
alone took in more than 40K in ticket sales.</i>

1138
01:18:38,580 --> 01:18:40,047
<i>(filmmaker) So then who got all the money?</i>

1139
01:18:40,082 --> 01:18:46,054
That's actually kind of funny. Right before
the convention, Shawn comes up to me...

1140
01:18:46,089 --> 01:18:48,722
"Yeah, I need money for rent and child support."

1141
01:18:48,757 --> 01:18:53,762
So, I bought his share of the convention.
Four hundred and thirty six bucks.

1142
01:18:53,797 --> 01:18:55,354
<i>(filmmaker) So, how much did you make then?</i>

1143
01:18:56,431 --> 01:19:00,026
I realized a net profit of over a quarter of a mil.

1144
01:19:00,669 --> 01:19:02,871
Are we going - like ever!?

1145
01:19:02,906 --> 01:19:04,805
Keep your thong on.

1146
01:19:05,107 --> 01:19:07,407
<i>I don't really collect the entrees anymore.</i>

1147
01:19:07,442 --> 01:19:11,813
Since our convention, my life
has flipped upside down.

1148
01:19:11,848 --> 01:19:15,048
My wife actually left me. Said she had enough.

1149
01:19:15,083 --> 01:19:18,518
But it all worked out for the best really because...

1150
01:19:18,553 --> 01:19:24,826
...the most wonderful, intelligent, special,
kind human being is now in my life.

1151
01:19:24,861 --> 01:19:26,593
Thank you.

1152
01:19:26,628 --> 01:19:31,433
I had a little party to help celebrate
my receiving of my One Year Chip...

1153
01:19:31,468 --> 01:19:34,891
...from Ex-Gay Ministries.
Straight for a year.

1154
01:19:35,871 --> 01:19:39,534
I was at that party and
Scott and I were talking.

1155
01:19:40,475 --> 01:19:42,844
Both drinking. We
were feeling a little tipsy...

1156
01:19:42,879 --> 01:19:45,472
Yes we were.
I fell off the wagon.

1157
01:19:46,481 --> 01:19:48,278
I guess you pushed
me off the wagon.

1158
01:19:49,251 --> 01:19:51,845
And I guess you could
say I'm guilty as charged.

1159
01:19:54,089 --> 01:19:56,455
It's wonderful.
But who was I kidding?

1160
01:19:56,825 --> 01:19:58,417
Not me.

1161
01:19:59,961 --> 01:20:01,519
I'm kind of ashamed of myself.

1162
01:20:02,230 --> 01:20:07,429
After all these years of being
overlooked and feeling basically invisible...

1163
01:20:07,936 --> 01:20:11,497
To think that I was doing that to
somebody else really makes me feel bad.

1164
01:20:13,041 --> 01:20:17,813
It's pretty incredible to find out that the person
who's right in front of you this whole time...

1165
01:20:17,848 --> 01:20:20,077
...is the perfect person for you.

1166
01:20:20,415 --> 01:20:23,942
I guess that's the good news.
We're just so happy.

1167
01:20:25,887 --> 01:20:30,620
<i>I hear Shawn's doing good.
I hear the band is doing good. But,...</i>

1168
01:20:31,026 --> 01:20:35,562
...that's neither here nor there.
I'm happy where I'm at.

1169
01:20:35,597 --> 01:20:39,556
I've just gotten myself in a band with
this great group of young folks.

1170
01:20:39,968 --> 01:20:45,772
Yeah, the sound of this band is just
more aggressive, more in-your-face.

1171
01:20:45,807 --> 01:20:50,005
You know, it's just a far cry from the
Christian stuff that I was doing before.

1172
01:20:50,812 --> 01:20:55,249
Even in some spots it's a little
Satanic, which is really neat.

1173
01:20:56,384 --> 01:21:01,344
<i>(creepy goth music)</i>

1174
01:21:05,460 --> 01:21:12,866
<i>They said I could sit in until they found somebody
else. But, I've been doing a killer job for them.</i>

1175
01:21:13,134 --> 01:21:15,135
<i>I think they're really pleased with my performance.</i>

1176
01:21:15,170 --> 01:21:23,202
I am! Knock on wood. I hope,
you know... I hope I get it. I'm sure I will.

1177
01:21:24,312 --> 01:21:29,272
<i>(heavy, shitty music)</i>

1178
01:21:36,424 --> 01:21:38,756
<i>Beverly is just a great gal.</i>

1179
01:21:39,160 --> 01:21:44,165
I think the world of her.
We just are hitting it off so well.

1180
01:21:44,200 --> 01:21:46,326
<i>We have this great friendship.</i>

1181
01:21:47,569 --> 01:21:51,528
<i>I mean, she's kind of reserved and she's
a little quiet and soft-spoken I guess.</i>

1182
01:21:52,307 --> 01:21:54,798
We call each other all the time. Well, I call her.

1183
01:21:55,110 --> 01:21:56,042
But...

1184
01:21:57,512 --> 01:22:00,481
...she's going out with our drummer, right? And...

1185
01:22:01,549 --> 01:22:03,176
Queef is a good guy.

1186
01:22:04,185 --> 01:22:07,255
<i>But, man, he just does not know how to
treat a lady and that really upsets me...</i>

1187
01:22:07,290 --> 01:22:10,325
<i>...and I want to let her know that,
"Hey, you could be doing so much better."</i>

1188
01:22:10,360 --> 01:22:13,021
But, you know how it is.

1189
01:22:14,329 --> 01:22:19,289
All the assholes... It's the biggest assholes
who always get the really great girls.

1190
01:22:20,669 --> 01:22:21,931
What are you gonna do?

1191
01:22:22,704 --> 01:22:26,196
<i>(groupies screaming)</i>

1192
01:22:33,248 --> 01:22:35,849
Aright everybody, calm down!

1193
01:22:35,884 --> 01:22:38,876
We're going to have a little bible study
on the bus before the show, okay?

1194
01:22:39,321 --> 01:22:42,051
I've got some backstage passes here!
I want to invite you to come on up!

1195
01:22:42,123 --> 01:22:46,287
There you go. Looking good. And you too.
You and your friend. Oh, yeah! Not you!

1196
01:22:47,295 --> 01:22:49,229
<i>We are now with Deuteronomy Records.</i>

1197
01:22:49,264 --> 01:22:52,667
<i>We've got a four record deal- possibly even
a movie. Things have been going so well.</i>

1198
01:22:52,702 --> 01:22:56,204
I mean we are living the Christian
rock and roll lifestyle here, man.

1199
01:22:56,239 --> 01:22:58,672
Absolutely. We're on our first world tour.

1200
01:22:58,707 --> 01:23:02,370
We just did Europe for like two
months and now we're doing what?

1201
01:23:02,444 --> 01:23:07,082
<i>Fifty four cities in the US. Where are we now?
Does anybody know where we are now?</i>

1202
01:23:07,117 --> 01:23:08,348
Does it matter?

1203
01:23:08,383 --> 01:23:11,011
I think we're inTexas somewhere
but I don't give a fuck.

1204
01:23:11,753 --> 01:23:16,713
But, when this tour started, we were
opening up for Holy Ghost Revival.

1205
01:23:16,958 --> 01:23:20,826
Our song just started burning up
the contemporary Christian charts

1206
01:23:21,629 --> 01:23:24,866
and now those motherfuckers are sucking our
dicks and we're the ones doing the headlining!

1207
01:23:24,901 --> 01:23:26,166
<i>That's right baby!</i>

1208
01:23:26,201 --> 01:23:31,673
It's the rock and roll life. We're seeing
the world, we're just making insane bank...

1209
01:23:31,708 --> 01:23:34,554
...we're boning all these hot Christian chicks...

1210
01:23:34,589 --> 01:23:37,401
...we're getting fucked up on the bus, I got a tat...

1211
01:23:38,513 --> 01:23:41,716
It's the life! Al my dreams have come true!

1212
01:23:41,751 --> 01:23:43,479
<i>God loves us!</i>

1213
01:23:44,085 --> 01:23:45,754
<i>God's going to let
us live forever.</i>

1214
01:23:45,789 --> 01:23:48,052
<i>Ha! Ha! Word!</i>

1215
01:23:48,857 --> 01:23:51,223
<i>Christian rock baby.</i>

1216
01:24:41,843 --> 01:24:43,543
Aaaahhh! You bad fuck fuck!

1217
01:24:43,578 --> 01:24:45,447
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
That's okay! That's okay!

1218
01:24:45,482 --> 01:24:46,513
Sorry! Sorry!

1219
01:24:46,548 --> 01:24:49,779
No, no, no - we've had nothing but problems
with this fucking maggot from day one.

1220
01:24:50,018 --> 01:24:51,986
We're gonna need an attorney out here stat!

1221
01:24:53,555 --> 01:24:57,192
This is Ringo. Say hi Ringo. Look at
the camera. It's your big day.

1222
01:24:57,227 --> 01:24:59,820
He doesn't judge and actually I appreciate that.

1223
01:25:00,528 --> 01:25:03,229
He is a fighter. Agood listener.

1224
01:25:03,264 --> 01:25:05,630
But he is a Sagittarius so what do you expect?

1225
01:25:07,469 --> 01:25:11,030
<i>When I'm in a situation where
my chastity is threatened...</i>

1226
01:25:12,173 --> 01:25:17,270
Well, I haven't actually been in a
situation like that with a real person.

1227
01:25:17,612 --> 01:25:21,448
But in my fantas... In my head...

1228
01:25:21,483 --> 01:25:24,484
I've been over this over and over again.

1229
01:25:24,519 --> 01:25:29,684
And chastity wins out and
purity almost every time.

1230
01:25:30,258 --> 01:25:31,993
<i>We're not getting any younger. Okay?</i>

1231
01:25:32,028 --> 01:25:33,561
We're all in our mid thirties.

1232
01:25:33,596 --> 01:25:34,327
That's doesn't matter!

1233
01:25:34,362 --> 01:25:36,557
A! It does matter to the labels.

1234
01:25:38,133 --> 01:25:41,468

1238
01:27:38,021 --> 01:27:41,621
<i>(The password is:"I can't hear shit!")</i>

1239
01:27:41,656 --> 01:27:45,456
<i>(Seriously, thanks for watching our movie!
You're the best and we love you! Later!)</i>
