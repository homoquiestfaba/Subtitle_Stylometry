00:00:03,936 --> 00:00:07,133
Hey, everybody.
It's me, Mickey Mouse.

2
00:00:07,206 --> 00:00:10,107
Say, you wanna come
inside my clubhouse?

3
00:00:12,277 --> 00:00:15,508
Well, all right! Let's go.

00:00:17,683 --> 00:00:18,877
Oops! [chuckles]

5
00:00:18,951 --> 00:00:21,545
Gee, I forget this every time.

6
00:00:21,620 --> 00:00:23,611
Now, to make the clubhouse appear,

7
00:00:23,689 --> 00:00:27,819
we need to say
the magic words exactly right.

8
00:00:27,893 --> 00:00:30,953
'Cause if we don't, well,
something funny might happen.

9
00:00:31,030 --> 00:00:32,691
The magic words are...

10
00:00:32,765 --> 00:00:36,496
Meeska, mooska, Mickey Mouse.

11
00:00:36,568 --> 00:00:38,126
Say it with me.

12
00:00:38,203 --> 00:00:42,469

00:06:27,085 --> 00:06:30,452
and carry Mickey's cake
to the clubhouse for you?

not up to something sneaky?

- Yeah, sure.
- OK, then.

To open up the clubhouse,
what are the right magic words?

And remember what happens
if you use the wrong words.

00:09:47,586 --> 00:09:48,917
Oopsie.

177
00:09:48,987 --> 00:09:51,922
I said the wrong magic words, didn't I?

178
00:09:51,990 --> 00:09:54,925
Drat. I'm in big trouble now.

179
00:09:54,993 --> 00:09:57,962
[Humming]

180
00:09:58,029 --> 00:10:00,190
Oh, ding dong it, it's Mickey.

181
00:10:00,265 --> 00:10:02,597
I'd better get out of here
before he sees me.

182
00:10:04,603 --> 00:10:07,401
Strange that Clarabelle
wasn't at the bakery.

183
00:10:09,441 --> 00:10:11,636
[Barking]

184
00:10:11,710 --> 00:10:14,702
Huh?! What happened
to the clubhouse?

185
00:10:17,282 --> 00:10:21,446
The clubhouse floated away?
Who made that happen?

186
00:10:24,456 --> 00:10:28,483
Pete did it? He said the wrong
magic words? Uh-oh!

187
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:32,860
We've gotta get the clubhouse back and
rescue Minnie, Goofy, Daisy and Donald,

188
00:10:32,931 --> 00:10:35,695
or we won't be able
to have our Easter party.

189
00:10:36,401 --> 00:10:40,735
Will you help us find all the pieces of
the clubhouse and get our friends back?

190
00:10:42,774 --> 00:10:44,071
Hot dog!

191
00:10:44,142 --> 00:10:46,838
[Sniffing]

192
00:10:46,911 --> 00:10:49,778
Hey, look. Pluto's already on the trail.

193
00:10:49,848 --> 00:10:51,110
Attaboy, Pluto.

194
00:10:51,182 --> 00:10:54,640
Come on, let's follow Pluto
and look for the clubhouse.

195
00:11:03,595 --> 00:11:08,658
Aw, Pluto, how will we ever find
all the pieces of the clubhouse?

196
00:11:08,733 --> 00:11:12,066
Whoa! Whoo-hoo!

197
00:11:12,137 --> 00:11:14,367
Ta-da!

198
00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:19,034
Oh, boy! It's Professor Von Drake.

199
00:11:22,947 --> 00:11:28,078
- [Chuckles] Hello there, Mickey.
- Professor, we need your help.

200
00:11:28,153 --> 00:11:30,053
The clubhouse floated away.

201
00:11:30,121 --> 00:11:35,491
You're telling me. I almost rocketed
right into the clubhouse pants.

202
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:38,961
Fortunately, the professor
went under the pants.

203
00:11:39,030 --> 00:11:42,898
I said ''underpants.''
Did you hear that?

204
00:11:42,967 --> 00:11:44,832
You saw the clubhouse pants?

205
00:11:44,903 --> 00:11:48,361
That's right.
They landed right over there.

206
00:11:49,174 --> 00:11:50,835
Oh, Minnie.

207
00:11:53,244 --> 00:11:57,704
- Oh, you found me.
- We rescued Minnie.

208
00:11:59,884 --> 00:12:01,476
[Sniffing]

209
00:12:01,553 --> 00:12:04,317
[Growls and barks]

210
00:12:04,389 --> 00:12:06,914
Hey, wait a minute. That's Pete.

211
00:12:06,991 --> 00:12:08,515
No, it's not.

212
00:12:09,394 --> 00:12:11,589
Oh, that Pete is running away.

213
00:12:11,663 --> 00:12:15,929
Aw, Pete must think I'm upset with him
for making the clubhouse float away.

214
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,060
But I'm not.
Gee, we could really use his help.

215
00:12:19,137 --> 00:12:21,605
Don't worry about that, Mickey.

216
00:12:21,673 --> 00:12:26,201
Now that we've found the pants,
we've got the Mousekedoer to help us.

217
00:12:26,277 --> 00:12:28,939
Say, that's right, Professor.

218
00:12:29,013 --> 00:12:32,210
Oh, that means we can
use our Mouseketools.

219
00:12:32,283 --> 00:12:35,013
Hot dog!
Come on, everybody.

220
00:12:35,086 --> 00:12:38,146
Let's go get our Mouseketools
from the Mousekedoer.

221
00:12:39,023 --> 00:12:41,685
[Hydraulic hissing]

222
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:44,558
# Mouseker-hey, Mouseker-hi
Mouseker-ho

223
00:12:44,629 --> 00:12:47,359
# Mouseker-ready, Mouseker-set
Here we go

224
00:12:47,432 --> 00:12:50,367
# You're a thinkin' and a solvin'
Work it through-er

225
00:12:50,435 --> 00:12:52,665
# Mouseker-me, Mouseker-you
Mousekedoer

226
00:12:52,737 --> 00:12:56,104
# Mouseker-me, Mouseker-you
Mousekedoer

227
00:12:56,174 --> 00:13:01,111
# Meeska, mooska, Mousekedoer

228
00:13:03,581 --> 00:13:07,881
# Mouseketools Mouseketools

229
00:13:07,952 --> 00:13:10,318
# Here are your Mouseketools #

230
00:13:10,388 --> 00:13:11,912
[Mickey] A pacifier?

231
00:13:13,992 --> 00:13:15,926
My toolbox.

232
00:13:17,662 --> 00:13:20,187
A crane. Wow!

233
00:13:21,599 --> 00:13:25,194
Ooh, and the mystery Mouseketool.

234
00:13:26,971 --> 00:13:30,099
That's a surprise tool
that can help us later.

235
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:39,616
Look, it's Toodles.
Hiya, Toodles.

236
00:13:41,619 --> 00:13:44,952
- Hi there, Mr. Toodles.
- Hi, Toodles.

237
00:13:45,023 --> 00:13:48,823
[Mickey] Toodles is gonna bring us our
Mouseketools when we need them.

238
00:13:50,929 --> 00:13:53,557
Oh, boy!
We got our Mouseketools.

239
00:13:53,631 --> 00:13:56,429
Now let's go find the
other pieces of the clubhouse.

240
00:13:56,501 --> 00:13:59,299
And rescue Donald, Daisy and Goofy.

241
00:13:59,370 --> 00:14:01,031
[Barking]

242
00:14:01,105 --> 00:14:06,042
Hold on, Mickey. We've got to get this
pants piece back where it belongs.

243
00:14:06,110 --> 00:14:08,237
Oops. You're right.

244
00:14:08,313 --> 00:14:11,476
Hmm. How are we going
to do that, Professor?

245
00:14:11,549 --> 00:14:14,382
Every time you
find a piece of the clubhouse,

246
00:14:14,452 --> 00:14:17,250
you have to touch it. Like so...

247
00:14:17,322 --> 00:14:20,314
Then, you're gonna say
the right magic words.

248
00:14:20,391 --> 00:14:22,325
Well, we know those.

249
00:14:22,393 --> 00:14:25,829
Meeska, mooska, Mickey Mouse.

250
00:14:25,897 --> 00:14:29,663
That's right. And after you're
saying the magic words,

251
00:14:29,734 --> 00:14:32,828
the piece will fly back home with you.

252
00:14:32,904 --> 00:14:35,998
Alright. Let's send the pants back home.

253
00:14:36,074 --> 00:14:38,941
Everybody say the right magic words.

254
00:14:39,010 --> 00:14:42,878
[All] Meeska, mooska, Mickey Mouse!

255
00:14:47,452 --> 00:14:50,615
[Von Drake] Whoop-de-do. Here we go.

256
00:14:58,363 --> 00:15:00,024
Oh, boy. We did it!

257
00:15:00,098 --> 00:15:01,360
We did it!

258
00:15:01,432 --> 00:15:05,630
Well, ain't that something?
The pants are back.

259
00:15:05,703 --> 00:15:08,194
They sure are. Thanks, everybody.

260
00:15:08,273 --> 00:15:11,174
But, Mickey, before we can
have our Easter party,

261
00:15:11,242 --> 00:15:13,710
we need to find four more pieces.

262
00:15:13,778 --> 00:15:16,645
Four more. You betcha!

263
00:15:16,714 --> 00:15:19,547
Professor, what's the
next piece we need to find?

264
00:15:19,617 --> 00:15:23,212
Well, why don't we
check with Toodles, let's?

265
00:15:23,288 --> 00:15:27,850
Good idea.
Everybody say, ''Oh, Toodles!''

266
00:15:27,926 --> 00:15:30,360
[All] Oh, Toodles!

267
00:15:33,598 --> 00:15:38,058
Alright. Toodles, do your doodles.

268
00:15:39,938 --> 00:15:42,873
[Von Drake] Oh, look at that.
It's like a puzzle.

269
00:15:42,941 --> 00:15:47,207
Now, already we've found
the first piece, the pants.

270
00:15:47,278 --> 00:15:50,145
Where does the first piece go?

271
00:15:53,885 --> 00:15:56,285
In number one.

272
00:15:57,488 --> 00:16:00,286
[Mickey] So what's the next
number we need to find?

273
00:16:02,894 --> 00:16:06,887
[Von Drake] Number two.
Right, the shoe.

274
00:16:09,367 --> 00:16:12,165
Just remember...

275
00:16:12,236 --> 00:16:15,228
# The pieces of the clubhouse
look a lot like Mickey Mouse

276
00:16:15,306 --> 00:16:16,830
- # Number one
- # The pants

277
00:16:16,908 --> 00:16:18,500
- # Number two
- # The shoe

278
00:16:18,576 --> 00:16:20,100
- # Number three
- # The head

279
00:16:20,178 --> 00:16:21,577
- # Number four
- # The ears

280
00:16:21,646 --> 00:16:23,511
- # And number five
- # The hand

281
00:16:23,581 --> 00:16:26,573
# Let's do that again
Oh, boy!

282
00:16:26,651 --> 00:16:29,643
# The pieces of the clubhouse
look a lot like Mickey Mouse

283
00:16:29,721 --> 00:16:31,188
- # Number one
- # The pants

284
00:16:31,255 --> 00:16:32,847
- # Number two
- # The shoe

285
00:16:32,924 --> 00:16:34,448
- # Number three
- # The head

286
00:16:34,525 --> 00:16:35,992
- # Number four
- # The ears

287
00:16:36,060 --> 00:16:38,051
- # And number five
- # The hand

288
00:16:38,796 --> 00:16:41,390
- # The hand?
- # The hand #

289
00:16:43,301 --> 00:16:46,464
OK, we gotta find number two.

290
00:16:46,537 --> 00:16:50,234
- The shoe.
- That's the shoe garage, is what.

291
00:16:50,308 --> 00:16:53,402
Come on.
Let's go find the shoe garage.

292
00:16:56,481 --> 00:16:59,473
- [Clicking]
- [Cow mooing]

293
00:17:05,757 --> 00:17:10,626
[Engine sputtering, coughing]

294
00:17:11,562 --> 00:17:15,089
- Goodbye, Mickey. Happy landings.
- Good luck, Mickey.

295
00:17:24,776 --> 00:17:27,574
[Chuckles] Bunny ears.

296
00:17:28,446 --> 00:17:30,778
Are you ready to be my copilot?

297
00:17:32,583 --> 00:17:34,778
Swell! Pilot to copilot,

298
00:17:34,852 --> 00:17:38,447
if you see the shoe garage, say ''shoe.''

299
00:17:49,133 --> 00:17:52,591
Yeah, there it is. And there's Goofy.

300
00:17:52,670 --> 00:17:54,297
Hey there, Mickey.

301
00:18:03,881 --> 00:18:07,442
Goofy, you're heading for a waterfall.

302
00:18:07,518 --> 00:18:10,681
Wow! Heading for a waterfall?!

303
00:18:10,755 --> 00:18:12,985
Why would I want to do that?!

304
00:18:15,359 --> 00:18:16,917
Whoa!

305
00:18:18,896 --> 00:18:21,956
Gee, we gotta rescue Goofy.
Quick!

306
00:18:26,504 --> 00:18:28,131
[Tires screeching]

307
00:18:28,206 --> 00:18:31,437
- [Gasps]
- [Goofy] Oh, Mickey.

308
00:18:37,849 --> 00:18:41,080
Hold on, Goof.
We're coming to the rescue.

309
00:18:41,152 --> 00:18:44,451
Hey, Mickey,
you gotta unstick the shoe.

310
00:18:44,522 --> 00:18:49,118
I mean, get the shoe unstuck.
And get me out of here!

311
00:18:49,794 --> 00:18:52,854
Let's check our Mouseketools
for something to help us.

312
00:18:52,930 --> 00:18:56,593
Everybody say, ''Oh, Toodles!''

313
00:18:56,667 --> 00:18:59,568
Oh, Toodles!

314
00:19:04,876 --> 00:19:07,868
[Mickey] We've got a pacifier,
my toolbox,

315
00:19:07,945 --> 00:19:11,472
a crane, and the mystery Mouseketool.

316
00:19:11,549 --> 00:19:15,212
Which Mouseketool will help us
lift the shoe out of the river?

317
00:19:17,355 --> 00:19:19,949
The crane. Right!

318
00:19:21,225 --> 00:19:24,490
We got ears, say ''cheers!''

319
00:19:30,234 --> 00:19:33,226
OK, now we're controlling the crane.

320
00:19:33,304 --> 00:19:36,535
Which way should we move
the handy helper to grab the shoe?

321
00:19:36,607 --> 00:19:39,007
Should we move it up or down?

322
00:19:40,945 --> 00:19:43,573
[Chuckles] Down. Right!

323
00:19:46,117 --> 00:19:48,642
[Chuckles] You got it!

324
00:19:49,253 --> 00:19:51,448
Which way should we move
the handy helper

325
00:19:51,522 --> 00:19:53,649
to pull the shoe out of the river?

326
00:19:55,526 --> 00:19:57,323
Up. Right!

327
00:20:00,131 --> 00:20:04,591
- [Hydraulic hissing]
- [Beeping]

328
00:20:04,669 --> 00:20:08,264
Good job.
We got the shoe garage out of the river.

329
00:20:08,339 --> 00:20:10,534
Yippee!

330
00:20:12,476 --> 00:20:14,876
Thanks for saving Goofy Bunny.

331
00:20:16,914 --> 00:20:20,008
Now let's bring the shoe back home.

332
00:20:20,084 --> 00:20:23,076
Everybody say the right magic words.

333
00:20:23,154 --> 00:20:27,147
[Both] Meeska, mooska, Mickey Mouse.

334
00:20:34,365 --> 00:20:37,425
[Goofy shrieks]

335
00:20:37,501 --> 00:20:40,334
- [Von Drake] How do you like that?
- [Minnie] It's back.

336
00:20:40,404 --> 00:20:43,498
Whoo-hoo! You found the shoe!

337
00:20:43,574 --> 00:20:46,099
And Goofy Bunny is back too.

338
00:20:46,177 --> 00:20:50,637
Alright. Now let's see what piece
we gotta find next.

339
00:20:53,317 --> 00:20:56,309
# The pieces of the clubhouse
look a lot like Mickey Mouse

340
00:20:56,387 --> 00:20:57,854
- # Number one
- # The pants

341
00:20:57,922 --> 00:20:59,514
- # Number two

342
00:20:59,590 --> 00:21:01,114

- # And number five

345
00:21:05,396 --> 00:21:08,058
- # The hand?
- # The hand #

346
00:21:08,132 --> 00:21:11,932
[Von Drake] We found the second piece,
the shoe garage.

347
00:21:12,003 --> 00:21:13,903
Where does it go?

348
00:21:15,339 --> 00:21:19,742
- Right, in number two.
- [Mickey] What number's next?

349
00:21:21,412 --> 00:21:22,709
Number three.

350
00:21:22,780 --> 00:21:25,476
[Von Drake] That's the clubhouse head,
is what that is.

351
00:21:27,285 --> 00:21:30,277
Come on. Let's go find
the clubhouse head.

352
00:21:32,556 --> 00:21:35,889
[Engine rewing]

353
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:37,689
Happy head-hunting.

354
00:21:37,762 --> 00:21:39,696
- [Chuckling]
- [Barking]

355
00:21:47,972 --> 00:21:50,304
Let's look for the clubhouse head.

356
00:21:51,709 --> 00:21:52,698
Yikes!

357
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:05,980
That was close.
Let's keep looking.

358
00:22:10,928 --> 00:22:13,260
Well, lookie there.

359
00:22:13,331 --> 00:22:16,596
- [Daisy] Whoa.
- [Mickey] Is that the clubhouse head?

360
00:22:17,668 --> 00:22:20,535
It sure is. Come on.

361
00:22:23,741 --> 00:22:25,003
Mickey!

362
00:22:25,743 --> 00:22:27,301
Please get me down.

363
00:22:28,879 --> 00:22:31,006
- I'm getting dizzy.
- Gee.

364
00:22:31,082 --> 00:22:33,744
We gotta get the head down
and rescue Daisy.

365
00:22:35,152 --> 00:22:37,916
What's holding the head way up there?

366
00:22:41,959 --> 00:22:43,824
The water. Right!

367
00:22:43,894 --> 00:22:47,625
We're gonna have to turn the water off
to bring the head back down.

368
00:22:47,698 --> 00:22:49,893
Yes. Just turn...

369
00:22:51,035 --> 00:22:52,559
...the valve.

370
00:22:53,137 --> 00:22:56,368
Hmm. Turn the valve.

371
00:22:57,308 --> 00:22:59,469
[Straining]

372
00:22:59,543 --> 00:23:01,807
[Panting]

373
00:23:01,879 --> 00:23:04,439
[Straining] Wow!

374
00:23:04,515 --> 00:23:06,107
- [Crash]
- [Cat screeching]

375
00:23:06,183 --> 00:23:07,650
Well, that didn't work.

376
00:23:07,718 --> 00:23:11,176
[Chuckles] Gee, this is
really hard to turn.

377
00:23:11,255 --> 00:23:14,782
Say, do you see anyone
who could help us turn the valve?

378
00:23:17,128 --> 00:23:19,323
Yeah, there's Pete.

379
00:23:19,397 --> 00:23:22,662
He's strong. Hiya, Pete.

380
00:23:22,733 --> 00:23:24,928
Oopsie! Gotta go.

381
00:23:27,271 --> 00:23:28,932
- Pete, wait!
- [Chicken clucks]

382
00:23:29,006 --> 00:23:31,839
Aw gee, we could've
really used his help.

383
00:23:31,909 --> 00:23:33,376
[Daisy] Hurry, Mickey.

384
00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:39,410
Hey, I'll betcha a Mouseketool
can help us turn the valve.

385
00:23:39,483 --> 00:23:42,111
Everybody say, ''Oh, Toodles!''

386
00:23:42,186 --> 00:23:45,644
Oh, Toodles!

387
00:23:51,028 --> 00:23:54,964
[Mickey] Which Mouseketool has
something to help us tighten the valve?

388
00:23:56,634 --> 00:23:59,102
My toolbox. Right!

389
00:24:00,971 --> 00:24:03,963
We got ears, say ''cheers!''

390
00:24:06,811 --> 00:24:08,073
Oh, boy!

391
00:24:10,848 --> 00:24:14,011
Which wrench matches
the shape on the valve?

392
00:24:21,058 --> 00:24:23,993
This one, the flower shape.

393
00:24:24,061 --> 00:24:27,724
Right. Now we can tighten
the valve and stop the water.

394
00:24:27,798 --> 00:24:29,789
Will you help me tighten the valve?

395
00:24:31,135 --> 00:24:33,660
Great! Turn the wrench with me.

396
00:24:33,737 --> 00:24:36,535
Turn, turn, turn.

397
00:24:36,607 --> 00:24:38,939
Turn, turn, turn.

398
00:24:39,009 --> 00:24:42,536
Now, one more great big turn.

399
00:24:43,481 --> 00:24:45,608
[Straining] Turn!

400
00:24:45,683 --> 00:24:48,709
Wow! You're really strong.

401
00:24:51,822 --> 00:24:54,689
Whew! Thanks for
getting me down, Mickey.

402
00:24:54,758 --> 00:24:57,022
And thank you too.

403
00:24:57,094 --> 00:24:59,153
Aw, anytime.

404
00:24:59,230 --> 00:25:02,961
Come on. Let's get the
clubhouse head back home.

405
00:25:03,033 --> 00:25:06,025
Everybody say the right magic words.

406
00:25:06,103 --> 00:25:10,096
Meeska, mooska, Mickey Mouse.

407
00:25:16,647 --> 00:25:19,047
[Daisy] Whee!

408
00:25:22,620 --> 00:25:26,613
- [Goofy] You're back! Yipee!
- [Von Drake] There they are.

409
00:25:27,525 --> 00:25:29,857
- Oh, terrific.
- You did it.

410
00:25:29,927 --> 00:25:34,523
With the head back in place,
we're really getting ahead.

411
00:25:35,466 --> 00:25:39,903
- And Daisy's back home.
- We did it!

412
00:25:39,970 --> 00:25:44,669
Alright, let's see what piece
we need to find next.

413
00:25:49,079 --> 00:25:52,071
# The pieces of the clubhouse
look a lot like Mickey Mouse

414
00:25:52,149 --> 00:25:53,616
- # Number one
- # The pants

415
00:25:53,684 --> 00:25:55,276
- # Number two
- # The shoe

416
00:25:55,352 --> 00:25:56,876
- # Number three
- # The head

417
00:25:56,954 --> 00:25:58,421
- # Number four
- # The ears

418
00:25:58,489 --> 00:26:00,480
- # And number five
- # The hand

419
00:26:01,158 --> 00:26:03,820
- # The hand?
- # The hand #

420
00:26:04,762 --> 00:26:08,698
[Von Drake] We found the third piece.
That's the head, you know.

421
00:26:08,766 --> 00:26:12,293
Now then, where does
the third piece go?

422
00:26:15,105 --> 00:26:17,835
Right! In number three.

423
00:26:17,908 --> 00:26:21,105
[Mickey] So what number piece
should we look for next?

424
00:26:24,715 --> 00:26:27,183
Number four, the ears.

425
00:26:27,251 --> 00:26:30,846
[Von Drake] Two round ears,
just like Mickey's ears.

426
00:26:33,224 --> 00:26:36,216
You know, I have
a suspicion where they went.

427
00:26:36,327 --> 00:26:39,194
Good thing I have a giant telescope.

428
00:26:39,263 --> 00:26:42,528
- [Cow mooing]
- [Hydraulic hissing]

429
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:44,932
- Gosh.
- Oh, my!

430
00:26:45,002 --> 00:26:47,402
That is a big telescope.

431
00:26:48,606 --> 00:26:49,937
[Barking]

432
00:26:50,608 --> 00:26:52,337
How about a peek there, Mickey.

433
00:26:52,409 --> 00:26:54,274
Gee, sure thing, Professor.

434
00:26:54,345 --> 00:26:58,475
Come on, look with me.
Let's find the clubhouse ears.

435
00:27:00,618 --> 00:27:03,815
Now, if you see the ears, say ''ears!''

436
00:27:04,221 --> 00:27:06,746
Ooh. [snickers]

437
00:27:06,824 --> 00:27:09,816
- Hello.
- Hi, there.

438
00:27:09,893 --> 00:27:11,053
[Both laughing]

439
00:27:11,128 --> 00:27:13,688
[Mickey] Aw, that's Chip 'n Dale.

440
00:27:14,632 --> 00:27:17,226
What? You saw the ears?

441
00:27:18,235 --> 00:27:20,897
Yeah, there they are.

442
00:27:20,971 --> 00:27:23,496
Gosh, but how are we
gonna get to them?

443
00:27:23,574 --> 00:27:27,169
Well, to get them,
we can take the clubhouse rocket.

444
00:27:27,244 --> 00:27:28,711
Great idea, Minnie.

445
00:27:28,779 --> 00:27:31,441
[Chuckles] Come on, copilots.

446
00:27:34,718 --> 00:27:36,913
[Minnie] Blasting off in ten seconds.

447
00:27:36,987 --> 00:27:39,353
Count down from ten to one with us.

448
00:27:39,423 --> 00:27:42,449
Ten, nine, eight,

449
00:27:42,526 --> 00:27:45,359
seven, six, five,

450
00:27:45,429 --> 00:27:49,365
four, three, two, one...

451
00:27:49,433 --> 00:27:51,025
Blastoff!

452
00:27:56,340 --> 00:27:59,138
[All cheering]

453
00:28:03,947 --> 00:28:05,471
Oh, boy!

454
00:28:05,549 --> 00:28:08,882
Let's look at the screen
and figure out how to get to the ears.

455
00:28:10,954 --> 00:28:12,819
Do you see the ears?

456
00:28:16,026 --> 00:28:19,291
Yep. There they are, on that planet.

457
00:28:19,363 --> 00:28:22,628
Hmm. Now which path
should we take to get there?

458
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:25,032
The path of pink space rocks?

459
00:28:27,371 --> 00:28:29,771
The path of yellow stars?

460
00:28:32,176 --> 00:28:35,168
Or the path of purple satellites?

461
00:28:42,052 --> 00:28:45,112
The path of stars! Right.

462
00:28:45,189 --> 00:28:49,148
Oh, and look, Mickey.
The stars are making a pattern.

463
00:28:49,226 --> 00:28:52,718
Big star, little star, little star.

464
00:28:52,796 --> 00:28:56,664
# Big star, little star, little star

465
00:28:56,734 --> 00:28:59,430
Sing the pattern with us.

466
00:28:59,503 --> 00:29:02,563
# Big star, little star, little star

467
00:29:02,639 --> 00:29:05,631
# Big star, little star, little star

468
00:29:05,709 --> 00:29:08,769
# Big star, little star, little star

469
00:29:08,846 --> 00:29:12,111
# Big star, little star, little star

470
00:29:12,182 --> 00:29:16,380
# Big star, little star, little star #

471
00:29:16,754 --> 00:29:20,451
[Minnie giggles] Hooray! We made it.

472
00:29:20,524 --> 00:29:23,254
Let's go get those ears.

473
00:29:23,327 --> 00:29:25,887
Good luck, Mickey.
See you at the clubhouse.

474
00:29:27,231 --> 00:29:29,165
Help me rocket to the ears.

475
00:29:29,233 --> 00:29:32,168
Put your hands up in the air
and fly with me.

476
00:29:32,236 --> 00:29:35,569
Here we go!

477
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:45,071
Donald!

478
00:29:50,254 --> 00:29:52,245
Are you in there?

479
00:29:52,322 --> 00:29:56,520
Oh, boy, oh, boy!
You found me.

480
00:29:57,127 --> 00:30:00,221
[Marching music plays]

481
00:30:00,297 --> 00:30:01,559
[Chuckles]

482
00:30:03,801 --> 00:30:08,204
OK, Donald.
Let's send these ears back home.

483
00:30:08,272 --> 00:30:10,797
Everybody say the right magic words.

484
00:30:10,874 --> 00:30:14,401
Meeska, mooska, Mickey Mouse.

485
00:30:17,581 --> 00:30:19,845
[Mickey chuckles] Wahoo!

486
00:30:19,917 --> 00:30:22,044
[Chip 'n Dale chuckling]

487
00:30:26,490 --> 00:30:28,958
- [All cheering]
- The ears are back!

488
00:30:32,162 --> 00:30:36,223
- You found the ears.
- And Donald's back.

489
00:30:37,167 --> 00:30:39,761
I was in outer space.

490
00:30:39,837 --> 00:30:43,295
Oh, boy! We got all our friends back.

491
00:30:43,373 --> 00:30:46,831
But we still have
one last piece to find.

492
00:30:49,313 --> 00:30:52,305
# The pieces of the clubhouse
look a lot like Mickey Mouse

493
00:30:52,382 --> 00:30:53,849
- # Number one
- # The pants

494
00:30:53,917 --> 00:30:55,509
- # Number two
- # The shoe

495
00:30:55,586 --> 00:30:57,110
- # Number three
- # The head

496
00:30:57,187 --> 00:30:58,654
- # Number four
- # The ears

497
00:30:58,722 --> 00:31:00,713
- # And number five
- # The hand

498
00:31:01,391 --> 00:31:04,053
- # The hand?
- # The hand #

499
00:31:04,928 --> 00:31:06,259
[Von Drake] Let's see.

500
00:31:06,330 --> 00:31:09,527
We found the fourth piece, the ears.

501
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:11,397
Where do they go?

502
00:31:13,737 --> 00:31:16,205
Right, in number four.

503
00:31:17,608 --> 00:31:20,338
[Mickey] So what number
do we still need to find?

504
00:31:22,613 --> 00:31:24,478
Number five, the hand.

505
00:31:24,548 --> 00:31:27,142
[Von Drake] That's the glove balloon,
you know.

506
00:31:27,217 --> 00:31:28,775
[Chuckles] Ooh.

507
00:31:29,419 --> 00:31:31,751
We don't need the glove balloon, Mickey.

508
00:31:31,822 --> 00:31:34,689
I'm ready for the Easter party
right now.

509
00:31:34,758 --> 00:31:38,558
Yeah, me too.
Oh, boy, oh, boy, oh, boy.

510
00:31:38,629 --> 00:31:39,789
Uh-oh.

511
00:31:39,863 --> 00:31:42,195
Mickey, what's the matter?

512
00:31:42,266 --> 00:31:45,963
I, uh... We don't have any Easter eggs.

513
00:31:46,036 --> 00:31:49,437
What?! No Easter eggs?

514
00:31:49,506 --> 00:31:54,136
I put all our eggs in one basket.
The glove balloon basket.

515
00:31:54,211 --> 00:31:57,703
Oh, boy. This is one bad pickle.

516
00:31:57,781 --> 00:32:00,045
Where could the glove balloon
have gone?

517
00:32:00,117 --> 00:32:03,518
Yeah, we've looked
almost everywhere.

518
00:32:03,587 --> 00:32:07,819
- Even in outer space.
- Oh, this is terrible.

519
00:32:07,891 --> 00:32:10,325
Exasperating.

520
00:32:24,908 --> 00:32:26,842
[Whimpering]

521
00:32:26,910 --> 00:32:28,537
Aw, Pluto. [sniffles]

522
00:32:28,612 --> 00:32:32,742
Well, the clubhouse just won't
be the same without the glove balloon.

523
00:32:32,816 --> 00:32:35,284
And I ruined the party.

524
00:32:35,352 --> 00:32:39,516
Gosh, I wish somebody saw
where the glove balloon went.

525
00:32:39,590 --> 00:32:43,549
Hmm. Oh, I know. Pete did.

526
00:32:43,627 --> 00:32:46,425
He saw all the pieces
of the clubhouse float away.

527
00:32:46,496 --> 00:32:50,364
That's right. Maybe Pete knows
where the glove balloon went.

528
00:32:50,434 --> 00:32:54,803
You at home out there,
do you see Pete anywhere?

529
00:32:56,707 --> 00:32:58,231
Huh?

530
00:32:58,308 --> 00:33:00,572
Uh-uh, uh-uh... Shh.

531
00:33:02,112 --> 00:33:05,445
- You see Pete?
- Yes, there he is.

532
00:33:06,249 --> 00:33:08,240
No, there he ain't.

533
00:33:09,853 --> 00:33:13,949
Help us call for Pete.
Say, ''Oh, Pete.''

534
00:33:14,024 --> 00:33:16,788
[All] Oh, Pete.

535
00:33:19,129 --> 00:33:21,495
Gosh, maybe Pete didn't hear us.

536
00:33:21,565 --> 00:33:23,795
Let's call him again, louder.

537
00:33:23,867 --> 00:33:26,392
[Iouder] Oh, Pete!

538
00:33:28,472 --> 00:33:32,966
[Chuckles] One more time everybody.
The loudest of all.

539
00:33:33,043 --> 00:33:36,137
[Yelling] Oh, Pete!

540
00:33:38,815 --> 00:33:39,873
Oh.

541
00:33:39,950 --> 00:33:41,542
Hello, everybody.

542
00:33:41,618 --> 00:33:43,950
You know, I...
I wasn't hiding or anything.

543
00:33:44,021 --> 00:33:46,421
- I just...
- Pete! Oh, boy!

544
00:33:46,490 --> 00:33:49,015
- I sure am glad to see ya.
- You are?

545
00:33:49,092 --> 00:33:52,220
It's OK, Pete. We know
you said the wrong magic words

546
00:33:52,295 --> 00:33:54,263
and made the clubhouse go to pieces.

547
00:33:54,331 --> 00:33:57,823
But I didn't mean to.
I was just playing, you see. And...

548
00:33:57,901 --> 00:34:00,927
- Don't worry. You can make up for it.
- I can?

549
00:34:01,004 --> 00:34:03,564
I need you to think really hard.

550
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:06,632
Now, did you happen to see
where the glove balloon went?

551
00:34:06,710 --> 00:34:09,178
The glove balloon, you say?

552
00:34:09,246 --> 00:34:11,180
Let me think now.

553
00:34:12,849 --> 00:34:15,317
Glove? Kinda like this one, bigger?

554
00:34:15,385 --> 00:34:17,649
- Uh-huh.
- Yeah, yeah.

555
00:34:17,721 --> 00:34:20,713
The glove balloon. Right.

556
00:34:20,791 --> 00:34:24,784
I remember. I saw it
float all the way up there.

557
00:34:24,861 --> 00:34:27,659
[Mickey] Wow! All the way
up into the clouds.

558
00:34:27,731 --> 00:34:31,258
Gosh, that's where the giant lives.

559
00:34:31,334 --> 00:34:33,325
- Giant?
- Oh, boy.

560
00:34:33,403 --> 00:34:35,394
You don't want to be disturbing him.

561
00:34:35,472 --> 00:34:37,804
But we need to get
the glove balloon back.

562
00:34:37,874 --> 00:34:40,172
Why, it's the last piece
of the clubhouse.

563
00:34:40,243 --> 00:34:42,837
Don't forget about the Easter eggs.

564
00:34:42,913 --> 00:34:45,677
We can't have an
Easter egg hunt without eggs.

565
00:34:45,749 --> 00:34:47,740
Hmm. We're gonna need something

566
00:34:47,818 --> 00:34:50,343
to help us float quietly
up into the clouds.

567
00:34:50,420 --> 00:34:53,014
Well, maybe one of those
Mousekedoodles...

568
00:34:53,090 --> 00:34:55,854
I mean, Mouseketools can help us.

569
00:34:55,926 --> 00:34:58,360
Good idea, Goofy Bunny.

570
00:34:58,428 --> 00:35:01,522
Everybody say, ''Oh, Toodles.''

571
00:35:01,598 --> 00:35:04,658
[All] Oh, Toodles!

572
00:35:11,508 --> 00:35:13,772
[Mickey] We've got two
Mouseketools left.

573
00:35:14,644 --> 00:35:18,307
The pacifier and
the mystery Mouseketool.

574
00:35:18,381 --> 00:35:21,839
Can we use the pacifier
to float up into the clouds?

575
00:35:23,587 --> 00:35:26,385
[Giggles] Nah, that's silly.

576
00:35:26,456 --> 00:35:31,450
[Von Drake] Yipee! That means it's time
for the mystery Mouseketool.

577
00:35:31,928 --> 00:35:36,661
[Mickey] Everybody say,
''Mystery Mouseketool.''

578
00:35:38,935 --> 00:35:41,597
What's today's mystery Mouseketool?

579
00:35:42,272 --> 00:35:45,867
- [Goofy] A bunch of balloons.
- [Mickey] You betcha.

580
00:35:45,942 --> 00:35:49,935
Hmm. Will the balloons help us
float quietly up into the clouds?

581
00:35:51,615 --> 00:35:53,082
They sure will.

582
00:35:53,150 --> 00:35:56,415
We got ears, say ''cheers!''

583
00:35:59,956 --> 00:36:02,288
Oh... I'm floating away.

584
00:36:02,359 --> 00:36:05,260
Don't worry, Pete.
I'm coming with ya.

585
00:36:05,328 --> 00:36:07,592
- Whoa!
- Whoa!

586
00:36:07,664 --> 00:36:09,928
- Be careful!
- Happy landings!

587
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:13,197
Whoa. It's cloudy in these clouds.

588
00:36:25,315 --> 00:36:27,306
Do you see the glove balloon?

589
00:36:28,585 --> 00:36:30,382
You do? Where?

590
00:36:33,190 --> 00:36:35,124
How about that? There it is.

591
00:36:35,192 --> 00:36:38,491
Imagine that.
Inside the giant's barn.

592
00:36:38,562 --> 00:36:39,551
[Gulps]

593
00:36:39,629 --> 00:36:42,826
Come on.
Let's go get that glove balloon.

594
00:36:43,533 --> 00:36:45,865
I'm not scared at all.
I'm not scared at...

595
00:36:45,936 --> 00:36:47,699
Well, maybe just a little.

596
00:36:51,975 --> 00:36:54,739
- [Door creaking]
- [Snoring]

597
00:37:01,384 --> 00:37:03,375
- The giant.
- Shh.

598
00:37:03,453 --> 00:37:06,547
- We don't want to wake him up.
- Oh, we sure don't.

599
00:37:06,623 --> 00:37:08,682
You know what, I got a good idea.

600
00:37:08,758 --> 00:37:12,091
I'll wait outside safe and sound,
I mean, uh, standing guard,

601
00:37:12,162 --> 00:37:14,790
things like that,
while you do everything and...

602
00:37:14,865 --> 00:37:17,356
Pete, you said you weren't scared.

603
00:37:17,434 --> 00:37:19,561
Are we brave?

604
00:37:21,104 --> 00:37:23,572
- We sure are.
- We are?

605
00:37:24,574 --> 00:37:27,042
Oh, yeah. We are brave.

606
00:37:28,044 --> 00:37:31,104
Come on. Let's tiptoe
up to the glove balloon.

607
00:37:31,181 --> 00:37:32,842
You f... first.

608
00:37:32,916 --> 00:37:35,248
Help us tiptoe up to the balloon.

609
00:37:35,318 --> 00:37:38,310
You need to stand up first.
Up on your feet.

610
00:37:39,689 --> 00:37:42,021
Now, tiptoe with us.

611
00:37:47,264 --> 00:37:50,461
[Snoring]

612
00:37:55,372 --> 00:37:58,808
The giant's snoring is keeping
the balloon really high.

613
00:37:58,875 --> 00:38:01,867
We're gonna need something
to stop the giant from snoring.

614
00:38:01,945 --> 00:38:05,881
How can we make a giant stop snoring?
It can't be done, I tell ya.

615
00:38:05,949 --> 00:38:08,281
That's why we got our Mouseketools.

616
00:38:08,351 --> 00:38:11,752
Everybody whisper, ''Oh, Toodles.''

617
00:38:11,821 --> 00:38:13,584
[Whispering] Oh, Toodles.

618
00:38:16,893 --> 00:38:20,556
[Mickey] Will the pacifier stop
the giant from snoring?

619
00:38:22,032 --> 00:38:23,693
It sure will.

620
00:38:24,701 --> 00:38:27,636
We picked all our Mouseketools.

621
00:38:27,704 --> 00:38:30,764
Everybody whisper, ''Super cheers!''

622
00:38:32,575 --> 00:38:35,908
[Sucking]

623
00:38:40,483 --> 00:38:43,919
We did it. Now let's take
the glove balloon home.

624
00:38:43,987 --> 00:38:45,784
Good idea. I'll go first.

625
00:38:45,855 --> 00:38:47,652
[Grunting]

626
00:38:47,724 --> 00:38:50,056
Chicken feathers.

627
00:38:52,595 --> 00:38:54,392
[Pete] Oh... Whoa.

628
00:38:54,965 --> 00:38:56,956
[Grunts] Oopsie.

629
00:38:57,033 --> 00:38:59,433
- Oh, excuse me.
- Pete, look out.

630
00:38:59,502 --> 00:39:02,062
Oh... [grunts]

631
00:39:03,773 --> 00:39:05,434
Hmm?

632
00:39:09,479 --> 00:39:10,810
[Sniffing]

633
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:15,078
Fee-fi-fo-fum.

634
00:39:15,151 --> 00:39:18,609
I smell something yummy, yum, yum.

635
00:39:18,688 --> 00:39:21,213
Yikes! We better get out of here.

636
00:39:22,359 --> 00:39:26,557
Ooh! A little birdie with round ears.

637
00:39:26,629 --> 00:39:28,654
Mickey!

638
00:39:29,699 --> 00:39:33,897
D'uh... I always wanted
a birdie for a pet.

639
00:39:33,970 --> 00:39:36,564
Oh, tweet-tweet.

640
00:39:36,639 --> 00:39:39,301
I'll keep you in my birdie cage.

641
00:39:40,577 --> 00:39:44,570
Ooh, I'm gonna go
get you some birdie food.

642
00:39:44,647 --> 00:39:48,640
I'll be right back.
D'uh, bye-bye birdie.

643
00:39:53,323 --> 00:39:55,848
Uh-oh. What should I do?

644
00:39:57,727 --> 00:40:00,525
Oh, it's mean Pete.

645
00:40:00,597 --> 00:40:04,124
[Chuckles] This is your
big chance, Pete, buddy.

646
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:06,395
Now that you've got the glove balloon,

647
00:40:06,469 --> 00:40:09,336
you can have the
clubhouse all to yourself.

648
00:40:09,406 --> 00:40:14,002
- Just like you were thinking.
- Yeah. Pete's clubhouse.

649
00:40:14,611 --> 00:40:18,877
- Uh-oh. It's nice Pete.
- Now, now, Petey.

650
00:40:18,948 --> 00:40:23,408
You know it's not nice to leave
poor Mickey in the giant's birdcage.

651
00:40:23,486 --> 00:40:26,819
- He's your friend.
- Mickey's not your friend.

652
00:40:26,890 --> 00:40:30,553
He didn't even give you an invitation
to the Easter party, remember?

653
00:40:30,627 --> 00:40:34,688
- He's got you there, nice Pete.
- Oh. But Mickey did invite you.

654
00:40:34,764 --> 00:40:38,757
The invitation's right there,
inside your back pocket.

655
00:40:38,835 --> 00:40:42,703
- It's been there all this time.
- It is?

656
00:40:44,107 --> 00:40:45,972
Do you see the invitation?

657
00:40:48,778 --> 00:40:51,144
Well, paint me
a polka-dotted bunny rabbit

658
00:40:51,214 --> 00:40:53,648
and sit me in the plastic green grass.

659
00:40:53,716 --> 00:40:56,048
I got an invitation to the Easter party.

660
00:40:56,119 --> 00:40:59,384
Oh... Mickey didn't forget me.

661
00:41:00,457 --> 00:41:03,119
Maybe I shouldn't have been so sneaky.

662
00:41:03,993 --> 00:41:05,927
Oh, weasels.

663
00:41:06,863 --> 00:41:10,663
Well, what are we waiting for?
We gotta save our friend, Mickey.

664
00:41:10,733 --> 00:41:12,894
Hold on there, pal.

665
00:41:12,969 --> 00:41:14,163
Pete!

666
00:41:14,237 --> 00:41:16,330
[Grunting]

667
00:41:16,406 --> 00:41:19,204
Say, will you kids help me
fly the glove balloon

668
00:41:19,275 --> 00:41:23,075
all the way up to the birdcage
and save Mickey?

669
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:25,406
Great!

670
00:41:25,482 --> 00:41:29,350
Now, reach your hand in the air
and grab the rope.

671
00:41:29,419 --> 00:41:31,410
Now pull.

672
00:41:31,488 --> 00:41:33,581
It's working. OK, keep pulling there.

673
00:41:33,656 --> 00:41:38,116
Great! Now, one more big pull!

674
00:41:39,028 --> 00:41:42,020
Way to go! We made it.

675
00:41:42,098 --> 00:41:43,087
Hurry up, Pete.

676
00:41:43,199 --> 00:41:46,134
We gotta open the birdcage
before the giant comes back.

677
00:41:46,202 --> 00:41:48,830
Will you help me and Pete
lift the latch?

678
00:41:50,173 --> 00:41:51,299
Great!

679
00:41:51,374 --> 00:41:55,970
Now put your hands out in front of you,
grab the latch and lift.

680
00:41:56,045 --> 00:41:58,843
- Lift, lift, lift.
- Lift, lift, lift.

681
00:41:58,915 --> 00:42:01,383
[Both straining]

682
00:42:01,451 --> 00:42:03,043
We almost got it.

683
00:42:03,119 --> 00:42:06,919
[Giant] # Fee-fi-fo-fum
Fee-fi-fo-fum

684
00:42:07,824 --> 00:42:11,590
Oh, pomegranates,
the giant's coming back.

685
00:42:11,661 --> 00:42:14,858
Now, one more great big lift.

686
00:42:14,931 --> 00:42:17,456
[Both straining]

687
00:42:18,268 --> 00:42:20,600
Hooray! Good work.

688
00:42:21,137 --> 00:42:23,605
Now let's get out of here.

689
00:42:24,941 --> 00:42:27,535
Huh? [grunting]

690
00:42:27,610 --> 00:42:29,339
Come back, birdie.

691
00:42:29,412 --> 00:42:33,007
Hurry there, Mickey.
The giant's coming.

692
00:42:33,082 --> 00:42:35,607
We have to say
the magic words super fast.

693
00:42:35,685 --> 00:42:37,550
What are the right magic words?

694
00:42:37,620 --> 00:42:40,088
Meeska, mooska, Mickey Mouse.

695
00:42:40,156 --> 00:42:42,556
Say them again, only faster.

696
00:42:42,625 --> 00:42:45,321
Meeska, mooska, Mickey Mouse.

697
00:42:52,702 --> 00:42:56,297
Bye-bye.
I taught him how to fly.

698
00:42:56,773 --> 00:42:58,707
- [Pete laughing]
- [Mickey] Hooray!

699
00:42:58,775 --> 00:43:01,539
- Oh, boy.
- [Pete] That was a close one.

700
00:43:01,611 --> 00:43:05,843
Whew! Gee, thanks for helping us
get away from the giant.

701
00:43:05,915 --> 00:43:08,042
[Chuckling] Ooh!

702
00:43:08,117 --> 00:43:10,244
Lookie here.

703
00:43:10,920 --> 00:43:13,480
Easter eggs and jelly beans.

704
00:43:13,556 --> 00:43:15,990
Aw, those are for the Easter party.

705
00:43:16,059 --> 00:43:18,357
You got your invitation,
didn't you, Pete?

706
00:43:19,596 --> 00:43:21,587
I sure did, Mickey.

707
00:43:21,664 --> 00:43:24,792
I thought you forgot about me,
but you didn't.

708
00:43:24,867 --> 00:43:27,199
'Cause you're my pal.

709
00:43:27,270 --> 00:43:30,398
[Chuckles] You betcha, pal.

710
00:43:30,473 --> 00:43:33,931
You know, I'm glad you're leader
of the clubhouse, Mickey.

711
00:43:34,477 --> 00:43:37,810
[Sighs] It's too much work for me.

712
00:43:37,880 --> 00:43:41,338
[Chuckles] Oh, look. We're almost home.

713
00:43:42,318 --> 00:43:44,343
[All cheering]

714
00:43:44,420 --> 00:43:46,354
They're home.

715
00:43:47,590 --> 00:43:50,923
- That's fantastic!
- This is great!

716
00:43:50,994 --> 00:43:55,158
Yahoo! You found
all five pieces, you did.

717
00:43:57,033 --> 00:44:00,025
# The pieces of the clubhouse
look a lot like Mickey Mouse

718
00:44:00,103 --> 00:44:01,570
- # Number one

719
00:44:01,638 --> 00:44:03,230

00:44:03,306 --> 00:44:04,830

723
00:44:09,112 --> 00:44:11,706
- # The hand?
- # The hand #

724
00:44:11,781 --> 00:44:14,113
[Von Drake] Now that we
got the fifth piece,

725
00:44:14,183 --> 00:44:17,983
the handy glove balloon,
where does it go?

726
00:44:19,789 --> 00:44:23,520
In number five. Right you are.

727
00:44:23,593 --> 00:44:26,460
[Mickey] We put the
clubhouse back together.

728
00:44:29,999 --> 00:44:34,095
[All cheering]

729
00:44:34,170 --> 00:44:35,762
- [Mickey] Oh, boy!
- Yipee!

730
00:44:35,838 --> 00:44:39,069
It sure is the best clubhouse.

731
00:44:39,142 --> 00:44:41,133
Now we can have our Easter party.

732
00:44:41,210 --> 00:44:43,872
- Yeah!
- [All cheering]

733
00:44:43,946 --> 00:44:46,938
Oh, Pete, you brought the cake.

734
00:44:47,016 --> 00:44:49,280
My hero.

735
00:44:51,020 --> 00:44:53,955
Oh, look what I found everybody.
Look.

736
00:44:54,023 --> 00:44:57,550
- I found one too.
- Me three.

737
00:44:57,627 --> 00:45:00,619
They don't call me
Goofy Bunny for nothing.

738
00:45:02,231 --> 00:45:07,760
[Chuckling]

739
00:45:09,038 --> 00:45:12,906
# This really, really is
the best Easter party ever

740
00:45:12,975 --> 00:45:15,967
# The best part is we're all together

741
00:45:16,045 --> 00:45:18,070
# And we'll be friends forever

742
00:45:18,147 --> 00:45:21,082
# It's springtime
A shing-a-ling-a-ling time

743
00:45:21,150 --> 00:45:23,641
# Springtime

# La la la la

745
00:45:28,858 --> 00:45:31,486
# Hanging the streamers
I'm the tallest one

746
00:45:31,561 --> 00:45:34,155
# Finding eggs is so much fun

747
00:45:34,230 --> 00:45:36,664
# I made a banner
with glitter and glue

748
00:45:36,733 --> 00:45:39,497
# Decorated eggs of yellow and blue

749
00:45:39,569 --> 00:45:42,060
# I'm making the music
I can't wait

750
00:45:42,138 --> 00:45:44,834
# Oh, boy, oh, boy, oh, boy
This is gonna be great!

751
00:45:44,907 --> 00:45:47,671
# So much to do
No time to stop

752
00:45:47,744 --> 00:45:50,076
# I wanna do the bunny hop

753
00:45:50,146 --> 00:45:51,875

# Autumn has pumpkins

00:46:16,873 --> 00:46:19,364
[Minnie] # In winter
Santa Claus comes to call

763
00:46:19,442 --> 00:46:22,639
# But I love spring best of all

764
00:46:22,712 --> 00:46:23,838

772
00:46:45,234 --> 00:46:48,533
[Chuckling] Aw.

773
00:46:48,604 --> 00:46:50,936
Come on, everybody.
Up on your feet.

774
00:46:51,007 --> 00:46:53,703
Let's do the hot dog dance.

775
00:46:53,776 --> 00:46:56,939
[# They Might Be Giants: Hot Dog!]

776
00:47:00,216 --> 00:47:02,480
# Hot dog!

777
00:47:02,552 --> 00:47:05,487
[Barking in tune]

778
00:47:05,555 --> 00:47:07,216
# Hot dog!

779
00:47:10,626 --> 00:47:13,424
# Hot dog, hot dog
Hot diggity dog

780
00:47:13,496 --> 00:47:16,021
# Now we got ears
It's time for cheers

781
00:47:16,098 --> 00:47:20,432
# Hot dog, hot dog
The problem's solved

782
00:47:20,503 --> 00:47:23,495
# Hot dog, hot dog
Hot diggity dog

783
00:47:24,373 --> 00:47:28,241
Wow! We had quite a day
hunting for the parts of the clubhouse.

784
00:47:29,011 --> 00:47:31,206
We found the clubhouse pants first.

785
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:33,271
[Minnie] That's where I was.

786
00:47:33,349 --> 00:47:36,512
[Mickey] Then we used the crane
to get the shoe garage.

787
00:47:36,586 --> 00:47:38,781
[Goofy] I nearly fell
down the waterfall.

788
00:47:38,855 --> 00:47:41,790
[Mickey] Next we used the toolbox
to get Daisy down.

789
00:47:41,858 --> 00:47:44,190
[Daisy] I was dizzy Daisy.

790
00:47:44,260 --> 00:47:46,660
[Mickey] We found Donald in space.

791
00:47:46,729 --> 00:47:48,128
[Donald] Outer space.

792
00:47:48,197 --> 00:47:51,894
[Mickey] And, finally, we used the
balloons to fly up to the clouds,

793
00:47:51,968 --> 00:47:55,961
and the pacifier to get the glove
balloon away from the giant.

794
00:47:56,038 --> 00:47:58,029
What a hot dog day!

795
00:47:58,107 --> 00:48:00,667
# Hot dog, hot dog
Hot diggity dog

796
00:48:00,743 --> 00:48:03,268
# It's a brand new day
What you waiting for?

797
00:48:03,346 --> 00:48:07,806
# Get up, stretch out
Stomp on the floor

798
00:48:07,884 --> 00:48:10,478
# Hot dog, hot dog
Hot diggity dog

799
00:48:10,553 --> 00:48:13,021
# Hot dog, hot dog
Hot diggity dog

800
00:48:13,089 --> 00:48:15,683
# We're splitting the scene
We're full of beans

801
00:48:15,758 --> 00:48:19,285
# So long for now
From Mickey Mouse

802
00:48:19,362 --> 00:48:20,693
That's me.

803
00:48:20,763 --> 00:48:23,231
# And the Mickey Mouse

804
00:48:23,299 --> 00:48:28,965
# Clubhouse #

00:48:29,572 --> 00:48:31,836
