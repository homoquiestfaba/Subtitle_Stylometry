1
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:07,000
On December 31st, 2014 a taxi cab
traveled through San Fransisco.

2
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:11,000
From Chinatown to Merrill.

3
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:16,100
The car carried a
single passenger...

4
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:18,100
a woman.

5
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:22,100
Her birth name,
Adaline Bowman.

6
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:28,100
Current alias,
Jennifer Larson.

7
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:33,100
This is the first and last
chapter of her story.

8
00:01:46,410 --> 00:01:50,100
Sorry just gotta be 5 minutes.
My dad's asleep, works nights.

9
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:52,100
Come on in.

10
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:04,100
I, ah, finished the color saps
in digital printing, last night.

11
00:02:04,190 --> 00:02:07,100
I pulled some line art
from the Internet...

12
00:02:07,790 --> 00:02:10,100
and printed the imperfections.

13
00:02:10,190 --> 00:02:13,100
See thats kinda my secret...
the dust marks and discoloration,

14
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:17,100
no one else will have an impression
to detail in a million years.

15
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:22,100
So why 29?
I mean, if I were you, shear a coupla years off...

16
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,200
you could definitely
get away with it.

17
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,200
You are very kind, Tommy.

18
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:31,200
Nice work.

19
00:02:32,290 --> 00:02:34,000
Was a pleasure doing
business with you.

20
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:36,000
And if any of your friends would need anything.
Why are you doing this?

21
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:37,100
Come again?

22
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,100
You are a smart kid,
forgery is a felony...

23
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:42,100
$250,000 fine,
six years in jail.

24
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,100
Shit, you...you're a cop?

25
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:49,100
No, I'm about as far from law
enforcement as you can get.

26
00:02:49,690 --> 00:02:52,500
I just hate to see
wasted potential, Jeff.

27
00:02:52,690 --> 00:02:56,100
Tony, it's Tony.
The autographed baseball's in your bedroom,

28
00:02:56,200 --> 00:03:02,100
made out to Jeff. Don't get sloppy. 
It's the little things that'll trip you.

29
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:28,100
Honey, I'm home.

30
00:03:36,196 --> 00:03:37,100
Reese?

31
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:42,100
Hi!

32
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:59,100
Come here, boy!

33
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:07,100
You are gonna love the new farmhouse.
Clean air, acres and acres of woods and mountain stream.

34
00:04:08,190 --> 00:04:09,220
You'll feel like a puppy again!

35
00:04:10,410 --> 00:04:15,100
Did you know, that your great great grandmother 
was born just a few towns over?

36
00:04:15,230 --> 00:04:18,100
So was mine!
Not at the same time of course.

37
00:04:18,419 --> 00:04:22,100
Oh...I gotta go to work.

38
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:27,100
Civic archives please.

39
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:30,100
Will take a while, mark is jammed.
Ok, then please take California to Hyde.

40
00:04:30,290 --> 00:04:33,100
Theres construction on Hyde.
Why don't you stay on this,

41
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:36,500
take this to golf, golf to Bush,
bush to polk, polk to Grove...

42
00:04:36,590 --> 00:04:39,000
and then just leave me
on the corner of market.

43
00:04:39,210 --> 00:04:40,500
You want my job?

44
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,500
You never know.

45
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:02,100
Good morning, Jenny.

46
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:03,800
Morning.
Morning.

47
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:07,100
Hi Kenneth.
We thought you might not be coming in today,

48
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:09,000
being New Year's Eve and all.

49
00:05:09,150 --> 00:05:13,000
Uh, its still a Wednesday.
The fun doesn't start till tonight, anyway.

50
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:16,100
Well, are you up for a little
excitement right now?

51
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:17,200
Sure, what is it?

52
00:05:17,290 --> 00:05:20,200
Your favorite, the news reel archives.
Finally being digitalized.

53
00:05:20,290 --> 00:05:23,200
We need a little help,
getting it ready to be shipped.

54
00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:25,220
I love to.

55
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:52,096
Adaline Marie Bowman, was born at
12.01 AM, Jan 1st, 1908...

56
00:06:52,196 --> 00:06:55,096
at Children's Hospital,
San Fransisco.

57
00:06:58,386 --> 00:07:02,278
The only child Of
Faye and Milton Bowman

58
00:07:06,978 --> 00:07:13,078
On June 16th, 1929, just as
Adaline Bowman and her mother, 

59
00:07:13,188 --> 00:07:18,088
stopped to admire the expanse, where three
years hence construction would be finished,

60
00:07:18,178 --> 00:07:19,099
on the Golden Gate bridge.

61
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:24,419
A young engineer,
displayed uncommon gallantry

62
00:07:34,079 --> 00:07:39,019
87 days later, Adaline married
Clarence James Prescott...

63
00:07:39,239 --> 00:07:43,659
at old St.Marys Cathedral
in San Fransisco.

64
00:07:46,139 --> 00:07:50,100
Three years later, Adaline
gave birth to a baby girl.

65
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:56,189
They named her Flemming,
after Adaline's paternal grandmother.

66
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:05,100
On Feb 17th, 1937, eight workers and two engineers
lost their lives when a section of scaffolding,

67
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:08,500
fell through a safety net during
construction of the Golden Gate bridge.

68
00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:13,100
Among the deceased was
Adaline's husband. 

69
00:08:21,220 --> 00:08:23,100
Ten months after her
husband's death...

70
00:08:25,290 --> 00:08:28,125
Adaline was driving north
to her parents beach cottage,

71
00:08:29,890 --> 00:08:32,100
where 5 year old Flemming
was waiting up for her...

72
00:08:34,390 --> 00:08:37,100
when something highly
unusual occurred.

73
00:08:37,970 --> 00:08:40,390
Something almost magical.

74
00:08:46,109 --> 00:08:49,210
Snow fell in
Senoma County, California!

75
00:09:25,210 --> 00:09:32,200
The immersion in the frigid water,
caused Adaline's body go into an innoxic reflex,

76
00:09:33,290 --> 00:09:38,200
instantly stopping her breathing,
then slowly her heartbeat.

77
00:09:39,470 --> 00:09:47,900
Within 2 minutes, Adaline Bowman's core
temperature had dropped to 87 degrees.

78
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:53,200
Her heart stopped beating.

79
00:09:58,180 --> 00:10:03,100
At 8:55, a bolt of lightning
struck the vehicle,

80
00:10:05,190 --> 00:10:08,100
discharging half a billion
volts of electricity.

81
00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:10,520
and producing 60,000
amperes of current.

82
00:10:10,780 --> 00:10:14,510
Its effect was threefold...

83
00:10:14,890 --> 00:10:19,400
First, the charge defibrillated
Adaline Bowman's heart.

84
00:10:21,895 --> 00:10:26,100
Second, she was jolted
out of her annoxic state,

85
00:10:26,885 --> 00:10:30,220
causing her to draw her
first breath in 2 minutes.

86
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:52,109
Third, based on Von Mymen's principle of
electron compression in deoxyribonucleic acid,

87
00:10:52,215 --> 00:10:56,115
which will be discovered
in the year 2035.

88
00:10:56,215 --> 00:11:02,095
Adaline Bowman will henceforth be
immune to the ravages of time.

89
00:11:02,195 --> 00:11:04,895
She will never age, another day.

90
00:11:32,895 --> 00:11:39,105
As the years passed, Adaline Bowman credited her
unchanging appearance to a combination of healthy diet...

91
00:11:39,195 --> 00:11:42,195
exercise, heredity and good look.

92
00:11:42,295 --> 00:11:43,295
Adaline?

93
00:11:44,235 --> 00:11:46,105
Mariam, hello?

94
00:11:46,205 --> 00:11:49,105
My God! You haven't changed a bit!

95
00:11:49,195 --> 00:11:52,105
Oh! That's very kind of you to say.
Flemming? You're all grown up!

96
00:11:52,195 --> 00:11:55,105
That's what I keep telling my mom.
She doesn't believe me.

97
00:11:55,195 --> 00:11:57,105
Aw! I'm sorry, but we
really must leave...

98
00:11:57,199 --> 00:12:01,105
You...you look like sisters!
You better stop or it'll go straight to my head.

99
00:12:01,195 --> 00:12:04,105
How is that possible?
A new face cream from Paris.

100
00:12:04,215 --> 00:12:07,000
Made from the royal jelly for the queen bee.
Ok, darling'. 

101
00:12:07,105 --> 00:12:09,125
Bye bye now!
Great seeing you!

102
00:12:16,195 --> 00:12:21,105
Action was required.
Just weeks later, when living a quite sub-urban existence...

103
00:12:21,195 --> 00:12:25,105
Adaline was pulled over for
a minor traffic infraction,

104
00:12:25,825 --> 00:12:30,105
Ma'am, it says you were born
on January 1st, 1908...

105
00:12:31,315 --> 00:12:36,105
That's right.
That will make you, 45 years old?

106
00:12:37,495 --> 00:12:40,105
Yes.
Ma'am, I'm gonna hold on to this.

107
00:12:40,245 --> 00:12:43,105
And you can come by to the
station to pick it up?

108
00:12:43,195 --> 00:12:45,005
Please bring your
birth certificate.

109
00:12:45,095 --> 00:12:48,805
I'll be happy to officer.
Is tomorrow morning alright?

110
00:12:48,905 --> 00:12:50,105
Sure.

111
00:12:53,115 --> 00:12:57,105
Soon after, Adeline moved
back to San Fransisco,

112
00:12:57,115 --> 00:12:59,405
and look a clerical job at
the School of Medicine.

113
00:13:05,149 --> 00:13:11,105
There, she availed herself to every
opportunity to research her condition.

114
00:13:17,115 --> 00:13:23,105
After a year of intense study, Adeline Bowman
was forced to confront the fact...

115
00:13:23,115 --> 00:13:28,105
that was absolutely no scientific
explanation for her condition.

116
00:13:28,195 --> 00:13:30,705
Are you a member of
the Communist party?

117
00:13:30,805 --> 00:13:34,505
Or have you ever been a member
of the Communist party?

118
00:13:44,225 --> 00:13:45,805
Adaline?

119
00:13:47,455 --> 00:13:49,805
Oh! I'm sorry, you have
the wrong person.

120
00:13:49,925 --> 00:13:53,805
From the Federal Bureau of Investigation,
Miss Bowman.

121
00:13:55,385 --> 00:13:58,000
Like to ask you a few questions,
if you don't mind.

122
00:13:58,095 --> 00:13:59,995
Why? I...I haven't done nothing wrong!

123
00:14:01,085 --> 00:14:02,225
I'm a good American!
How dare you bother me...

124
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:03,965
at the place of my employment?

125
00:14:04,065 --> 00:14:05,865
Couldn't be helped, ma'am.

126
00:14:05,965 --> 00:14:08,965
We have no record of your residence.
This way please.

127
00:14:14,015 --> 00:14:17,105
Nothing to worry
about, Miss.Bowman.

128
00:14:17,415 --> 00:14:19,995
Just gonna run a
few tests on you.

129
00:15:26,405 --> 00:15:28,875
If anyone contacts you,
tell tell them that I...

130
00:15:28,975 --> 00:15:33,785
went to Europe on vacation,
that I never came back.

131
00:15:34,105 --> 00:15:38,605
The next time we see each other,
I will have a new identity.

132
00:15:38,696 --> 00:15:42,905
I'll always be your mother.
You'll just have to introduce me as your friend.

133
00:15:42,995 --> 00:15:44,605
Mama, no.

134
00:15:44,995 --> 00:15:49,905
It has to be this way.
Here...

135
00:15:59,285 --> 00:16:02,125
To ensure the freedom and safety
of self and her daughter...

136
00:16:02,735 --> 00:16:06,105
Adaline vowed to keep moving,

137
00:16:07,525 --> 00:16:13,105
changing her name, residence
and appearance every decade.

138
00:16:14,525 --> 00:16:21,105
And never to speak a word,
of her fate to another living soul.

139
00:16:30,405 --> 00:16:34,105
In 7 weeks when Jenifer Larson,
disappears forever...

140
00:16:34,215 --> 00:16:40,105
and Susan Flietcher takes up residence in
a remote farmhouse in Ashton, Oregon...

141
00:16:42,205 --> 00:16:50,105
Adaline Bowman, beside from one moment of weakness
will have kept her vow for the past 60 years.

142
00:17:03,115 --> 00:17:06,105
Hello, Ray again?
Amanda, you're not gonna stand me up are you?

143
00:17:06,195 --> 00:17:09,105
Yes, we did that last year.
Why you don't trust me?

144
00:17:09,195 --> 00:17:14,105
I just can't believe you haven't got a better offer.
Impossible! I'll pick you up at 8:00?

145
00:17:14,215 --> 00:17:20,105
Actually, that's the other reason I called.
The Grand Hotel of Knob hill is sending a car for me.

146
00:17:20,195 --> 00:17:23,105
Look at you!
Have you ever been there for New Year's?

147
00:17:23,195 --> 00:17:27,105
Only once, ages ago.
I guess it's pretty lavish.

148
00:17:27,195 --> 00:17:31,105
Well I better get to it, then.
I'll see you soon, goodbye Ray.

149
00:17:52,299 --> 00:17:53,205
You hungry?

150
00:17:56,109 --> 00:17:57,199
No?

151
00:17:57,319 --> 00:18:01,101
Oh! You just wanna come out
with me tonight, don't you?

152
00:18:01,201 --> 00:18:03,121
Sorry buddy, it's a girl's night.

153
00:18:36,359 --> 00:18:40,129
Avery if you don't remove your camera...
Both my hands are on the table!

154
00:18:40,229 --> 00:18:41,239
Addison?

155
00:19:21,129 --> 00:19:22,149
Thank you.

156
00:19:23,249 --> 00:19:28,119
Happy New Year!
Oh! Hey Amanda, that was you clapping, wasn't it?

157
00:19:28,219 --> 00:19:30,119
How did you guess?

158
00:19:30,219 --> 00:19:32,119
You have good manners.
We are the last two!

159
00:19:33,219 --> 00:19:35,219
Hey grab a glass!

160
00:19:35,319 --> 00:19:38,110
Tell me, what did I miss?
Not much, just some happy chatter.

161
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:43,009
It's funny, no matter how old you get,
New Year's eve feels like the one night,

162
00:19:43,108 --> 00:19:45,109
that anything's possible.
What's your resolution?

163
00:19:45,219 --> 00:19:49,109
Same as always: True love.
How about you?

164
00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:52,109
To live this year as
though it were my last.

165
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:56,100
You never know, it could be.
At our age, so hell ya. 

166
00:19:56,190 --> 00:19:58,225
Let's live...

167
00:20:01,105 --> 00:20:04,105
Beware of Bachelor, 3 'o clock.
Getting us stormed up!

168
00:20:04,195 --> 00:20:07,705
Hmm, what's he like?
Brown hair, icy blues, smittens...

169
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:10,100
How come I'm with you,
I always get hit 'em with babies ?

170
00:20:10,190 --> 00:20:12,100
Shh! He's here.
Good evening ladies.

171
00:20:12,190 --> 00:20:15,190
Welcome to the Utahan! I know!
We don't look at the average 28.

172
00:20:15,299 --> 00:20:20,080
You are too kind! What's your name?
Dale Davenport.

173
00:20:20,170 --> 00:20:21,195
Dale's a painter.
Really?

174
00:20:21,275 --> 00:20:24,195
A starving honest artist though, because he
doesn't accept his affluent family's help.

175
00:20:24,295 --> 00:20:26,170
I...I'm sorry.
Have we met?

176
00:20:26,270 --> 00:20:29,000
No, no, no.
Just your Cartier wristwatch...

177
00:20:28,895 --> 00:20:31,010
one of the very first.

178
00:20:31,101 --> 00:20:33,182
I'm assuming it was given to you
from a well to do grandfather.

179
00:20:34,370 --> 00:20:36,770
Gr..Great grandfather.
But how do you that I paint?

180
00:20:36,870 --> 00:20:40,100
Your hands are covered in paint.
That one was easy.

181
00:20:41,190 --> 00:20:43,100
Well Picassa! 
Have a seat!

182
00:20:43,190 --> 00:20:46,110
We're gonna buy you a drink.
Ah...sure.

183
00:20:46,180 --> 00:20:48,910
Happy New Year.
Happy New Year.

184
00:20:49,090 --> 00:20:50,100
Thank you.

185
00:21:26,610 --> 00:21:34,110
6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1...
Happy New Year!

186
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:40,120
Hello?
Thank you sweetheart.

187
00:21:44,190 --> 00:21:47,000
Oh! No, no, you don't
have to sing it...

188
00:21:47,088 --> 00:21:49,590
No, please, please don't sing it.
I already had enough birthdays.

189
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:52,160
Aww! Where are you?

190
00:21:53,172 --> 00:21:55,160
You didn't go out at all? 

191
00:21:56,060 --> 00:21:58,160
Hmm, I don't blame you.

192
00:21:58,290 --> 00:22:00,070
Are we still on for tomorrow?

193
00:22:00,285 --> 00:22:04,120
Great, alright get some sleep.
I love you.

194
00:22:05,220 --> 00:22:06,090
Good night.

195
00:22:17,190 --> 00:22:19,190
Whoever he is, he has got
one hell of an excuse.

196
00:22:20,290 --> 00:22:21,890
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to scare you.

197
00:22:21,990 --> 00:22:26,720
It's just...isn't there some sort of tradition
if you are alone on New Years Eve...

198
00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:28,120
that you're supposed
to kiss a stranger?

199
00:22:30,220 --> 00:22:34,120
Damn! You heard that before.
Just once from a young king-cross bee...

200
00:22:34,220 --> 00:22:36,120
...type.

201
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:39,020
Happy New Year.

202
00:22:46,260 --> 00:22:49,020
I'm too old for this.
Oh no! Don't disappear.

203
00:22:49,230 --> 00:22:52,040
I'll call you tomorrow.
Tell me everything I missed, I love you.

204
00:22:52,250 --> 00:22:54,040
Bye dear!

205
00:23:06,110 --> 00:23:09,220
Oh well! That'll teach me not to
my hand where it doesn't belong.

206
00:23:09,330 --> 00:23:17,010
Something tells me it won't.
You know, that was a risky move.

207
00:23:17,510 --> 00:23:20,010
What was? 
Not introducing yourself before you leave.

208
00:23:20,239 --> 00:23:23,070
I'm a dare devil.

209
00:23:24,020 --> 00:23:27,010
I'm Ellis, pleasure to meet you.

210
00:23:27,099 --> 00:23:29,099
Like the island?
No man is.

211
00:23:29,220 --> 00:23:32,150
I'm Jenny.
Like the poem?

212
00:23:35,810 --> 00:23:39,010
No, not like the Sam...
* Say I’m weary, say I’m sad...*

213
00:23:39,110 --> 00:23:43,080
* Say I’m growing old, but add, *
* Jenny kiss’d me. *

214
00:23:48,180 --> 00:23:51,020
Who wrote that?
Poem one of the romantics I think...

215
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:55,020
Now you are not sure!
Actually I am, but I...

216
00:23:55,105 --> 00:23:57,138
I dun wanna come across,
like a know it all!

217
00:23:57,238 --> 00:24:00,138
Too bad, I adore
know-it-alls.

218
00:24:04,238 --> 00:24:07,038
So...where you off to?

219
00:24:07,158 --> 00:24:10,538
Some place with better food,
my apartment.

220
00:24:11,738 --> 00:24:12,938
Yourself?

221
00:24:13,138 --> 00:24:14,938
Back to the party.

222
00:24:15,038 --> 00:24:17,938
I, ah, just wanted to spend
27 floors with you.

223
00:24:19,068 --> 00:24:21,568
That was a risky move.
What?

224
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:24,668
Leaving your date upstairs. 
I hope it that was worth it.

225
00:24:24,798 --> 00:24:26,768
What are you talking about?

226
00:24:26,888 --> 00:24:31,768
Oh cmon! Beautiful woman in blue.
Does her name happen to end in 'kova'?

227
00:24:33,368 --> 00:24:36,018
No! Her name is Agnus Bogs.

228
00:24:36,118 --> 00:24:38,768
Her uncle is the chef.
I'll let him know, you liked his food.

229
00:24:40,268 --> 00:24:41,888
And she's not my date.

230
00:24:48,588 --> 00:24:50,128
Taxi, ma'am?
Yes please, thank you. 

231
00:24:55,588 --> 00:24:57,110
Good night.

232
00:24:57,210 --> 00:25:02,110
Oh! I'll just wait with you.
So you can find out where I live?

233
00:25:04,210 --> 00:25:06,119
It does make it a lot
easier to send flowers.

234
00:25:07,419 --> 00:25:08,219
Okay.

235
00:25:08,328 --> 00:25:10,219
Thank you but
I'll manage.

236
00:25:12,223 --> 00:25:15,219
Goodbye, its been an
adventure meeting you. 

237
00:25:19,119 --> 00:25:20,219
Thank you.

238
00:25:21,619 --> 00:25:23,259
Wait.
Oh!

239
00:25:24,169 --> 00:25:28,219
There you go again!
Putting your hand in places it doesn't belong. 

240
00:25:30,019 --> 00:25:31,219
How do we get in touch?

241
00:25:32,019 --> 00:25:35,219
Happy New Year, Ellis.
Thank you so much.

242
00:25:59,829 --> 00:26:00,619
Am I late?

243
00:26:00,719 --> 00:26:02,439
No more than usual.

244
00:26:02,550 --> 00:26:04,439
Happy Birthday, mama!

245
00:26:05,139 --> 00:26:06,239
Thank you, darling'

246
00:26:09,145 --> 00:26:11,239
I'm so happy to see you.

247
00:26:15,339 --> 00:26:17,639
You know, you don't have
to still give me cards.

248
00:26:18,959 --> 00:26:22,239
I love you.
I love you too.

249
00:26:23,539 --> 00:26:25,639
So when are you
moving back up?

250
00:26:25,739 --> 00:26:28,109
3rd week in February.
Right on schedule.

251
00:26:28,199 --> 00:26:29,219
Of course!

252
00:26:35,319 --> 00:26:38,219
I see, you already forgot about
our little talk on sodium?

253
00:26:38,519 --> 00:26:41,219
No, I'm simply choosing to ignore.

254
00:26:44,219 --> 00:26:47,119
Actually, um...

255
00:26:48,019 --> 00:26:50,119
I'm thinking of moving myself.

256
00:26:52,219 --> 00:26:57,219
But, you love where you live.
I do, but you know, theres just too many scares.

257
00:26:57,809 --> 00:27:03,079
Last week, Kayle Fonso,
fell and she broke her hip.

258
00:27:03,379 --> 00:27:06,079
The doctor said, she might
never leave the hospital.

259
00:27:07,279 --> 00:27:11,079
And then, the very next day,
Molly Andrews called me...

260
00:27:11,285 --> 00:27:17,079
and she told me about this wonderful
retirement community in Arizona.

261
00:27:17,179 --> 00:27:21,079
She moved in last spring, she says,
she's never been happier in her whole life.

262
00:27:25,169 --> 00:27:26,279
What's the matter?

263
00:27:27,879 --> 00:27:31,279
I live abouts in Oregon's,
so that I can be close to you.

264
00:27:31,479 --> 00:27:33,379
See you can come up
for long visits.

265
00:27:33,897 --> 00:27:36,279
Move in, with me eventually.

266
00:27:38,379 --> 00:27:41,279
We haven't lived together,
since I was in high school.

267
00:27:42,079 --> 00:27:44,279
But...you're not
getting any younger.

268
00:27:45,279 --> 00:27:47,279
What if you moved to Arizona
and something happened to you?

269
00:27:47,379 --> 00:27:49,179
What if you got sick?

270
00:27:49,879 --> 00:27:53,179
Then, I would hope, that you'd
come and take care of me.

271
00:27:56,199 --> 00:28:01,079
What if I'm too late?
No, no! We cannot do this.

272
00:28:01,359 --> 00:28:03,279
Not on your birthday.

273
00:28:03,499 --> 00:28:05,279
It's a holiday!

274
00:28:11,079 --> 00:28:16,050
Finally I fell off my feet!
What are you two cloaking about?

275
00:28:16,150 --> 00:28:21,125
Major news, Mr.Jones is donating $50,000 worth
of 1st edition classics to this library!

276
00:28:21,245 --> 00:28:23,125
What books do you know?

277
00:28:23,225 --> 00:28:28,175
We're going to find out very soon because his office
called to say that he'll be here deliver them himself.  

278
00:28:30,225 --> 00:28:31,125
Hi.
Oh no!

279
00:28:31,225 --> 00:28:32,625
I'm Ellis.
Oh, good!

280
00:28:32,725 --> 00:28:33,525
Welcome, Mr.Jones!

281
00:28:33,625 --> 00:28:34,625
Thank you.

282
00:28:34,725 --> 00:28:40,625
On behalf of the San Fransisco Heritage Society,
I would like to express our sincere gratitude, 

283
00:28:40,725 --> 00:28:45,025
for your most generous gift.
I left my shipment in receiving but I'm sure they will be back.

284
00:28:45,125 --> 00:28:48,425
If you don't mind, we would like a
photograph of you donating...the books.

285
00:28:48,525 --> 00:28:50,125
Yeah. Yeah,
sure sure.

286
00:28:51,225 --> 00:28:52,125
Can you give me one
second, though?

287
00:28:55,325 --> 00:28:58,025
Hey?
It's me.

288
00:28:59,115 --> 00:29:01,125
The know-it-all.
What are you doing here?

289
00:29:02,220 --> 00:29:04,089
I got something for you too.

290
00:29:04,379 --> 00:29:06,109
Some flowers.

291
00:29:08,009 --> 00:29:13,109
Daisy Miller by Henry James,
Dandelion Wine by Ray Bradbury,

292
00:29:13,199 --> 00:29:16,109
White Oleander, Janet Fitch

293
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:19,850
Very clever.

294
00:29:22,550 --> 00:29:24,600
How did you know I work here?

295
00:29:24,710 --> 00:29:28,050
I just tried the board.
I saw you coming out of our meeting.

296
00:29:29,170 --> 00:29:31,220
Oh! You could have mentioned
that in the elevator.

297
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:36,720
If we had met in a
taller building...

298
00:29:37,450 --> 00:29:39,170
I would have had
time to cover that.

299
00:29:43,140 --> 00:29:46,810
I do not know about you but
I'm ready for some donating.

300
00:29:47,750 --> 00:29:49,620
Perfect.
I'll be here.

301
00:29:49,660 --> 00:29:53,210
No way, I would like you to accept
the books on behalf of the library.

302
00:29:53,330 --> 00:29:55,790
Oh! No, no, no. I can't do that.
Yeah of course you can.

303
00:29:55,860 --> 00:29:58,180
No, no, I don't want
my photo taken.

304
00:29:58,290 --> 00:29:59,860
Don't worry.
You look stunning.

305
00:29:59,980 --> 00:30:03,180
It's not about vanity.
I just don't like people taking my photograph.

306
00:30:05,710 --> 00:30:09,200
Suit yourself, if you won't accept 'em,
I won't donate 'em.

307
00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:13,170
You wouldn't do that.
I'll...I'll even have a book burning.

308
00:30:15,590 --> 00:30:19,260
It's just...I don't like
my photos taken, Ellis.

309
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:23,870
Ok, fine. Fine.
Here's an alternative.

310
00:30:25,330 --> 00:30:26,610
Let me take you out tomorrow.

311
00:30:29,210 --> 00:30:32,130
Ok, that's impossible.

312
00:30:38,370 --> 00:30:40,860
Alright. That's fine,
I'll just pack up the books then.

313
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:45,440
Where?

314
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:51,180
Some place you've never been.

315
00:30:52,420 --> 00:30:55,190
Well if it's in this city,
then it's unlikely.

316
00:30:56,470 --> 00:30:57,480
Try me.

317
00:31:00,090 --> 00:31:02,170
You can leave the boots in
the front when you are done.

318
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:04,770
I'll be right outside.
We will, thank you Tom.

319
00:31:04,890 --> 00:31:05,890
Alright.

320
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:12,180
Alright.
I give up.

321
00:31:14,350 --> 00:31:16,790
In the first year of
the gold rush...

322
00:31:16,810 --> 00:31:19,930
about 60,000 people came to
San Francisco by ship.

323
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:22,260
And a lot of them high trailers,
trailed to the hills...

324
00:31:22,410 --> 00:31:23,920
leaving their boats behind.

325
00:31:24,540 --> 00:31:27,570
Hundreds of boats
were left on shore.

326
00:31:28,260 --> 00:31:31,960
Downtown San Francisco was
built right on top of them.

327
00:31:32,070 --> 00:31:33,070
I didn't know that.

328
00:31:34,350 --> 00:31:35,350
Now city services...

329
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:38,940
found this when they were
digging for utility line.

330
00:31:41,290 --> 00:31:42,290
My God.

331
00:31:42,570 --> 00:31:43,580
Isn't it something?

332
00:31:45,670 --> 00:31:47,900
Is that...?
Yeah, that's a boat.

333
00:31:48,670 --> 00:31:50,320
oh wow...

334
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:53,170
This is incredible!

335
00:31:53,290 --> 00:31:56,410
So we had the digging stopped
immediately of course...

336
00:31:56,490 --> 00:31:58,760
because we want this made
evident to the public.

337
00:31:58,830 --> 00:31:59,850
We?

338
00:31:59,910 --> 00:32:02,650
San Francisco Historical
Preservation Society.

339
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:04,590
Let me guess.
You are on the board.

340
00:32:04,670 --> 00:32:07,850
Well yeah, they'll let anyone
on the board, these days.

341
00:32:16,350 --> 00:32:19,410
How did you come by your fortune anyway?
By inheritance?

342
00:32:20,170 --> 00:32:21,170
Luck.

343
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:24,350
I was a math major in college...

344
00:32:24,430 --> 00:32:28,280
and in my spare time I developed
an algorithm for analyzing climate data.

345
00:32:29,260 --> 00:32:33,690
But my room-mate figured out it could
also be used for economic forecast.

346
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:36,310
So we started a company
in the dorm room.

347
00:32:36,390 --> 00:32:40,810
Sold it few years later and
with his half he retired to Fiji.

348
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:44,130
And with my half,
I...I'm doing this.

349
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:46,330
Your job is giving away money.

350
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:49,860
Yeah that right, but if you wanna make
a real difference in this world...

351
00:32:49,970 --> 00:32:52,810
that's a lot harder than it seems.

352
00:32:55,420 --> 00:32:56,820
What about you, Jenny?

353
00:33:03,340 --> 00:33:05,350
I own a dog.

354
00:33:07,230 --> 00:33:08,230
Okay.

355
00:33:08,850 --> 00:33:10,280
I should be getting back.

356
00:33:10,870 --> 00:33:12,180
But we're having lunch.

357
00:33:13,430 --> 00:33:16,980
It's too late, Ellis.
I only got an hour.

358
00:33:20,190 --> 00:33:21,090
Okay, um...

359
00:33:21,190 --> 00:33:23,060
Let me at least
walk you back.

360
00:33:27,830 --> 00:33:32,160
Thank you for all of this.
But you should know I'm moving.

361
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:38,340
Uh! Okay.

362
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:39,440
I have an idea.

363
00:33:40,660 --> 00:33:43,010
I'll tell you a joke.
If you laugh...

364
00:33:43,820 --> 00:33:46,440
You have to go out with me one
more time before you move away.

365
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:50,910
If you don't laugh, I will know we're
incompatible and gladly give up.

366
00:33:51,020 --> 00:33:54,480
That must be one hell of a joke.
It's the funniest in human history.

367
00:33:54,550 --> 00:33:58,550
But it's subtle, sophisticated...
so you probably won't get it.

368
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:00,350
Yeah, probably.

369
00:34:01,300 --> 00:34:02,300
Do you like cap baseball?

370
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:05,150
Yeah, I love it.
Good.

371
00:34:06,330 --> 00:34:08,320
One day at Fenway Park...

372
00:34:08,420 --> 00:34:11,630
Ted Williams...
do you know who he was?

373
00:34:11,710 --> 00:34:15,840
Hmm, the thumper.
Batting average 344, right?

374
00:34:15,950 --> 00:34:18,470
What? Yeah.
That Ted Williams.

375
00:34:18,580 --> 00:34:20,880
Anyway, he's hanging
around Fenway...

376
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,900
and this horse walks up and says:
"I wanna play for the Sox".

377
00:34:23,901 --> 00:34:25,940
An actual horse!?
An actual horse.

378
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:28,380
So he says like, so what can you do?

379
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:31,070
And the horse says,
"I hit just like you, just a whole lot better".

380
00:34:31,180 --> 00:34:35,310
He takes up a bat with his teeth
and Ted's like, "Okay".

381
00:34:35,380 --> 00:34:37,340
He throws him a few
and sure enough...

382
00:34:40,330 --> 00:34:41,380
into the bleachers.

383
00:34:42,220 --> 00:34:46,220
So Ted is like Woo!

384
00:34:46,290 --> 00:34:48,130
What else can you do?
And the horse says: "Well I can play short stalk"

385
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:51,493
So Ted hits him a few ground balls...

386
00:34:51,384 --> 00:34:52,647
And sure enough.

387
00:34:52,747 --> 00:34:54,547
He's a vacuum cleaner

388
00:34:54,657 --> 00:34:58,150
Yeah! So Ted's like:
"Oh so you pitch?"

389
00:34:58,230 --> 00:35:00,420
And the horse just looks at him and says:

390
00:35:01,130 --> 00:35:03,450
"Pitch? Who ever heard a horse ever pitching"

391
00:35:09,660 --> 00:35:10,660
Yeah!

392
00:35:11,016 --> 00:35:12,016
Yes!

393
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:17,070
Ladies and gentlemen,
the lady has been conquered.

394
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:21,290
That's the worst joke I've
ever heard in my life.

395
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:23,350
Thank you.
It wasn't a compliment.

396
00:35:23,740 --> 00:35:27,020
Dinner. Tuesday my place.
303-18 Street.

397
00:35:28,470 --> 00:35:29,470
8 'o clock.

398
00:35:31,390 --> 00:35:32,390
Fine.

399
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:45,880
Good morning, Miss Larson.
Good to see you again.

400
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:48,500
Good morning.
So what can we do for you today?

401
00:35:48,620 --> 00:35:50,690
I want to add another
signee to my account.

402
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:54,220
May I ask the reason?
I will be traveling for a while.

403
00:35:54,910 --> 00:35:56,070
Traveling?

404
00:35:56,800 --> 00:36:00,090
Ok, I'll get the paperwork.
I'll be right back.

405
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:16,940
All these companies rate
very highly with us.

406
00:36:17,050 --> 00:36:19,120
What this?
The Haloid Photographic Company?

407
00:36:19,190 --> 00:36:22,040
They have been about 50 years.
They make photo paper and equipment.

408
00:36:22,170 --> 00:36:25,270
They are developing something
called electro photography.

409
00:36:25,330 --> 00:36:28,750
Could revolutionize the business.
But you won't see any immediate returns.

410
00:36:28,830 --> 00:36:31,030
It could be a few years away.
That's alright.

411
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:33,590
I'd hate to see tied
your time and money.

412
00:36:34,310 --> 00:36:35,610
I am patient.

413
00:36:36,550 --> 00:36:38,140
What do you know?
They changed their names.

414
00:36:38,590 --> 00:36:39,600
Now they called...

415
00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:44,370
What the heck?
Start with "X"...

416
00:36:45,030 --> 00:36:47,300
It is Greek.
It's pronounced: "Xerox".

417
00:36:48,250 --> 00:36:49,250
Xerox?

418
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:54,310
So, we can start with
the signature card.

419
00:36:55,830 --> 00:36:58,490
What is the name of the co-signer?
Susan Fleisher.

420
00:36:58,610 --> 00:37:00,630
Susan F-l-e...

421
00:37:00,740 --> 00:37:03,760
i-s-h-e-r.

422
00:37:06,690 --> 00:37:08,010
Now, I made you some salmon.

423
00:37:08,730 --> 00:37:12,970
This no eating nonsense just won't
do if you are a proper farm dog.

424
00:37:13,910 --> 00:37:17,050
I want you to eat every bite.
Do you understand me?

425
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:20,820
Alright.

426
00:37:20,930 --> 00:37:22,230
Here we go.

427
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,000
Hello?

428
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:51,560
Ellis?

429
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:58,680
Am I interrupting?
Hey!

430
00:38:00,230 --> 00:38:03,980
I was afraid you got cold feet.
No, just trouble getting a cab.

431
00:38:04,750 --> 00:38:05,750
Hey.
Hi.

432
00:38:09,830 --> 00:38:10,830
Can I take your coat?

433
00:38:11,490 --> 00:38:12,640
Okay.

434
00:38:16,630 --> 00:38:17,880
Hmmm.
Your place it's, ah...

435
00:38:18,750 --> 00:38:20,870
Unfinished?
Yes!

436
00:38:20,950 --> 00:38:24,580
Ah, I noticed that part.
Is that an artistic choice?

437
00:38:25,536 --> 00:38:26,536
No.

438
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:30,560
I have to paint, plaster and
do all the wiring stuff...

439
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:34,440
but I'm doing it all by myself.
So, it's gonna take a little while.

440
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:36,820
I think, your food is burning.

441
00:38:42,100 --> 00:38:43,500
Just, eh, make yourself comfortable.

442
00:38:44,090 --> 00:38:45,300
Sit down, relax.

443
00:38:46,680 --> 00:38:47,680
Okay.

444
00:38:51,620 --> 00:38:54,720
What is it...that you are cooking?

445
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:59,670
Well it's a delicacy that
is not for everyone.

446
00:39:02,230 --> 00:39:03,230
Hope you like it.

447
00:39:04,980 --> 00:39:07,020
Are you ready?
Would you like a drum roll?

448
00:39:09,370 --> 00:39:10,370
Viola.

449
00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:14,310
It was between this
and stuffed quail.

450
00:39:14,750 --> 00:39:16,230
Please do not tell me
you're disappointed.

451
00:39:16,340 --> 00:39:19,770
I...I'm truly overjoyed!
Yes!

452
00:39:20,820 --> 00:39:22,230
Dig in.
Okay.

453
00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:31,000
Well?
It's perfect, just the music is painful.

454
00:39:31,830 --> 00:39:35,240
You don't like jazz?
No, I love Jazz. This is something else.

455
00:39:39,010 --> 00:39:42,610
My mom grew up in Maine.
She's is a real New Englander.

456
00:39:42,620 --> 00:39:45,470
Sweet but tough noucer.

457
00:39:46,730 --> 00:39:48,550
My dad, on the other hand...

458
00:39:49,550 --> 00:39:52,780
has his head in the stars.
Literally.

459
00:39:52,980 --> 00:39:54,339
He's an astronomer.

460
00:39:54,340 --> 00:39:56,370
Just retired from Stanford.

461
00:39:57,340 --> 00:40:00,880
His claim to fame was that he
discovered an unusual comet.

462
00:40:01,180 --> 00:40:03,019
Unusual, in what way?

463
00:40:03,020 --> 00:40:05,849
Well it has a mathematically proven perigee.

464
00:40:05,850 --> 00:40:10,380
So based on his calculation, it will
pass Earth in the winter of 1981.

465
00:40:11,430 --> 00:40:13,300
Did it?
No.

466
00:40:13,860 --> 00:40:15,850
No, it did not.

467
00:40:17,110 --> 00:40:20,229
But that did not stop him from
looking for it every year.

468
00:40:20,230 --> 00:40:23,250
It was a kind of ritual we had,
that was what was goin' on.

469
00:40:24,660 --> 00:40:26,390
My dad is still looking.

470
00:40:29,900 --> 00:40:33,130
Well one more glass of
wine and I'm hazy head.

471
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:37,170
Oh! No, no thank you.
Please.

472
00:40:37,470 --> 00:40:40,199
Oh! Come on.
There was a saying in Italy...

473
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:44,140
Anni, Amori e bicchieri di vino,
run contano is mai.

474
00:40:44,970 --> 00:40:49,100
"Years, lovers, wine cups..."

475
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:52,519
"years, lovers and glasses or wine...

476
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:55,190
these are things that are never kind"

477
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:58,970
You have no idea.

478
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:05,890
I like your view.

479
00:41:08,510 --> 00:41:09,510
Thank you.

480
00:41:11,620 --> 00:41:13,330
I like the way you read.

481
00:41:15,390 --> 00:41:16,390
What?

482
00:41:16,870 --> 00:41:20,510
The first time I saw you, coming out
of a board meeting, you were reading.

483
00:41:22,740 --> 00:41:26,650
Your hair was pulled back and
you were wearing a blue dress.

484
00:41:27,130 --> 00:41:30,519
It was a book in Braille.
I slowed down to watch.

485
00:41:30,520 --> 00:41:32,330
How long did you watch for?

486
00:41:32,530 --> 00:41:34,950
Long enough to realize
you weren't blind.

487
00:41:35,910 --> 00:41:37,470
And I had to meet you.

488
00:41:37,970 --> 00:41:39,890
And I did not know
when or how, but...

489
00:41:40,690 --> 00:41:41,940
I knew I would.

490
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:53,680
I think I, ah...

491
00:41:55,170 --> 00:41:56,750
I think I remember that day.

492
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:02,010
Yes, it was a book in Norwegian.

493
00:42:02,020 --> 00:42:03,939
And because of all
the umlaut, the vocals...

494
00:42:03,940 --> 00:42:06,210
it was really impossible
to comprehend.

495
00:42:07,450 --> 00:42:09,500
You're kidding.
Yes.

496
00:42:10,460 --> 00:42:12,230
Are you kidding?
Yes, yes of course.

497
00:42:13,450 --> 00:42:14,940
It was braille for beginners.

498
00:42:15,860 --> 00:42:17,550
Nursery rhymes or something.

499
00:42:24,642 --> 00:42:26,852
You could tell me anything
you want and I'll believe it.

500
00:42:27,781 --> 00:42:29,399
I know almost nothing about you.

501
00:42:31,992 --> 00:42:33,425
It's better this way.

502
00:42:37,500 --> 00:42:39,977
No, it's not.

503
00:43:01,296 --> 00:43:04,529
Tell me something I can hold
on to and never let go?

504
00:43:10,841 --> 00:43:12,244
Let go.

505
00:44:00,946 --> 00:44:01,946
Hi.

506
00:44:04,523 --> 00:44:05,565
Good morning.

507
00:44:11,141 --> 00:44:13,843
Ok, move your arms.
Some of us have to work for a living.

508
00:44:15,468 --> 00:44:18,490
Oh! Okay, I get it.
You are holding me hostage.

509
00:44:23,386 --> 00:44:24,857
Will you ever come back?

510
00:44:33,534 --> 00:44:37,017
You sure there's no one who speaks English,
or someone who speaks Spanish?

511
00:44:37,302 --> 00:44:39,093
No, no.
(Speaking in Spanish)

512
00:44:42,168 --> 00:44:43,830
I have to go.
Hold on, hold on.

513
00:44:43,942 --> 00:44:48,623
Give me a second, okay?
Give me a second, I'm trying to deal this in Portuguese.

514
00:44:48,753 --> 00:44:49,753
I can't.

515
00:44:52,460 --> 00:44:53,550
What are you trying to say?

516
00:44:53,665 --> 00:44:57,227
The rain forest trust fund
is to buy 5,000 acres.

517
00:44:57,991 --> 00:45:00,117
Hmm, well you are not even close.
Here.

518
00:45:00,191 --> 00:45:01,191
Thank you.

519
00:45:01,240 --> 00:45:12,182
(Speaking in Portuguese)

520
00:45:12,282 --> 00:45:13,603
I'm late for work.

521
00:45:13,631 --> 00:45:16,262
Wait. That's it?
Let go.

522
00:45:51,997 --> 00:45:53,776
It's a $1.50, Ma'am.

523
00:46:04,020 --> 00:46:05,020
Ma'am?

524
00:46:05,044 --> 00:46:07,421
I just changed my mind.
Please keep driving.

525
00:46:08,110 --> 00:46:09,110
You got it.

526
00:47:03,977 --> 00:47:04,977
Reese.

527
00:47:05,610 --> 00:47:06,943
Reese?

528
00:47:15,399 --> 00:47:17,853
Baby, are you okay?

529
00:47:20,189 --> 00:47:21,413
Are you okay, baby?

530
00:47:23,663 --> 00:47:26,475
His urine creatinine
is way too high.

531
00:47:27,011 --> 00:47:28,731
Which means his
kidneys are failing.

532
00:47:28,943 --> 00:47:31,898
In toxins in his body
can't handle it.

533
00:47:32,695 --> 00:47:33,988
Is he in pain?

534
00:47:35,946 --> 00:47:37,204
It's difficult to say.

535
00:47:38,439 --> 00:47:40,672
If you were me,
what would you do?

536
00:47:45,725 --> 00:47:46,725
I will be thinking about...

537
00:47:49,766 --> 00:47:51,444
what a wonderful life he's had.

538
00:47:53,617 --> 00:47:55,813
How lucky you are,
to have found each other.

539
00:48:06,260 --> 00:48:08,886
May I have a moment
alone with him, please?

540
00:48:09,503 --> 00:48:10,503
Of course.

541
00:48:48,008 --> 00:48:51,643
Hey Jenny! This is Ellis.
I tried you coupla times.

542
00:48:52,156 --> 00:48:55,051
Hope you got my messages.
Call me back.

543
00:50:53,260 --> 00:50:54,260
Jenny!

544
00:50:56,470 --> 00:50:57,570
What are you doing here?

545
00:50:58,970 --> 00:51:01,610
I tried to call you, but...
How did you get my address?

546
00:51:04,260 --> 00:51:05,260
Ahh, he library.

547
00:51:07,640 --> 00:51:10,530
Come on, don't be upset.
I didn't know what else to do.

548
00:51:15,308 --> 00:51:17,041
My dog, I had to...

549
00:51:18,091 --> 00:51:22,094
I had to put him down.
Oh! I'm so sorry to hear that.

550
00:51:22,165 --> 00:51:23,940
You should have waited
for me to contact you.

551
00:51:24,010 --> 00:51:26,968
Umm, Jenny, I...
There's a reason I don't give out my address.

552
00:51:27,555 --> 00:51:31,295
I'm sorry, honestly.
This isn't going to work, I'm moving.

553
00:51:31,947 --> 00:51:33,113
Are you serious?

554
00:51:37,269 --> 00:51:39,011
Hi, for you.

555
00:51:58,399 --> 00:52:01,669
Barbara Ireland before
she moved to Florida...

556
00:52:02,896 --> 00:52:04,537
she got rid of
all her books.

557
00:52:05,834 --> 00:52:08,419
I couldn't get rid sooner
of this book if...

558
00:52:14,073 --> 00:52:17,421
Well, seems I'm not the
only one getting nostalgic.

559
00:52:18,651 --> 00:52:20,600
You've had such a wonderful life.

560
00:52:21,219 --> 00:52:23,051
I would have liked to think so.

561
00:52:25,046 --> 00:52:26,219
I just wished you had...

562
00:52:27,488 --> 00:52:29,766
you know, she could have
been there for more of it.

563
00:52:30,550 --> 00:52:31,630
So do I.

564
00:52:35,371 --> 00:52:36,371
Remember that?

565
00:52:36,803 --> 00:52:39,998
1954 was junior
year of college.

566
00:52:40,645 --> 00:52:42,447
It's the last photo I have of you.

567
00:52:43,094 --> 00:52:45,141
Well you seen one,
you seen 'em all.

568
00:52:46,045 --> 00:52:47,045
It's true.

569
00:52:54,303 --> 00:52:55,303
What is it?

570
00:52:56,621 --> 00:52:57,905
What's wrong?

571
00:52:58,528 --> 00:53:00,581
I'm just tired of running...

572
00:53:02,600 --> 00:53:04,720
of lying to good people.

573
00:53:06,199 --> 00:53:07,371
Then stop.

574
00:53:08,165 --> 00:53:10,724
Nobody is chasing
you anymore.

575
00:53:11,401 --> 00:53:14,420
Anyone who has ever been
suspicious is long dead.

576
00:53:15,215 --> 00:53:17,938
You don't have to
be alone forever.

577
00:53:18,602 --> 00:53:21,265
Don't you miss having
someone to love?

578
00:53:21,877 --> 00:53:23,898
It's been such a long time.

579
00:53:23,973 --> 00:53:26,201
It's not the same when
there's no future.

580
00:53:26,318 --> 00:53:28,471
What are you talking about?
You got nothing but future!

581
00:53:28,586 --> 00:53:32,292
I mean a future together,
growing old together.

582
00:53:33,699 --> 00:53:35,100
Without that, love is...

583
00:53:37,104 --> 00:53:38,340
it's just heartbreak.

584
00:53:38,458 --> 00:53:40,550
It's the same for everybody.

585
00:53:41,927 --> 00:53:44,422
How many times have
my heart been broken?

586
00:53:44,549 --> 00:53:45,549
Too many.

587
00:53:46,111 --> 00:53:49,496
If I had your looks and your energy,
I'd fallen tomorrow.

588
00:53:49,607 --> 00:53:50,871
Really would.

589
00:53:52,250 --> 00:53:54,150
I did meet someone.

590
00:53:54,398 --> 00:53:55,398
What?

591
00:53:55,422 --> 00:53:58,736
No, on New Year's Eve.
He jumped in my elevator.

592
00:53:58,808 --> 00:54:01,648
Why didn't you tell me?
Because I knew you would look at me like that.

593
00:54:03,317 --> 00:54:08,064
Don't get too excited.
I, ah...I told him to leave me alone.

594
00:54:08,977 --> 00:54:11,993
I was horrible.
Cruel.

595
00:54:12,064 --> 00:54:15,187
Tell him you're sorry.
Tell him you made a mistake.

596
00:54:15,708 --> 00:54:17,184
I can't.
I'm leaving.

597
00:54:17,861 --> 00:54:21,138
You're moving to Oregon,
not Timbuktu.

598
00:54:23,196 --> 00:54:24,246
Come on.

599
00:54:25,007 --> 00:54:27,753
If you won't do it for yourself,
do it for me.

600
00:54:28,959 --> 00:54:29,959
Please?

601
00:54:41,719 --> 00:54:43,314
Hello?
Can I help you?

602
00:54:44,905 --> 00:54:47,999
I'm here to see Ellis Jones.
He's not expecting me.

603
00:54:48,099 --> 00:54:50,727
Well let's see what
we can do about that.

604
00:54:52,069 --> 00:54:53,069
And you are?

605
00:54:54,635 --> 00:54:55,967
Incredibly sorry.

606
00:54:57,454 --> 00:54:59,693
Mr.Jones, you got
a guest down here.

607
00:55:00,351 --> 00:55:03,124
I bet you got a name.
Jennifer Larson.

608
00:55:04,419 --> 00:55:08,444
Please, tell him understand
if he doesn't want to see me.

609
00:55:08,515 --> 00:55:10,433
I'm here just to say I'm sorry...

610
00:55:10,976 --> 00:55:14,931
and that my life has
been unbelievable...

611
00:55:15,082 --> 00:55:17,956
since longer than he can imagine.

612
00:55:18,065 --> 00:55:20,481
And I was emotional,
the other day....

613
00:55:20,556 --> 00:55:21,671
And...

614
00:55:23,008 --> 00:55:25,813
Now realize how incredible
kind to me, he's been...

615
00:55:25,904 --> 00:55:29,596
and I was too stupid
to accept it.

616
00:55:29,713 --> 00:55:31,719
But I know better now...

617
00:55:32,488 --> 00:55:35,016
and...that why I wanted to tell
him how sincerely sorry I am.

618
00:55:37,557 --> 00:55:40,811
Okay.
And...ask him if he can come downstairs maybe?

619
00:55:41,780 --> 00:55:44,875
Let me make it up to him
by taking him out tonight.

620
00:55:46,725 --> 00:55:47,725
Please.

621
00:55:49,967 --> 00:55:53,760
Ah, Jennifer Larson.
She says she understands that you don't...

622
00:55:54,515 --> 00:55:57,683
Oh, you heard that?
Ok, good.

623
00:55:58,231 --> 00:56:00,069
He wants to know,
where are you taking him?

624
00:56:01,588 --> 00:56:04,032
Some place he's never been before.

625
00:56:30,570 --> 00:56:32,459
Hello.
Hey Jenny.

626
00:56:32,460 --> 00:56:33,460
Come.

627
00:56:41,640 --> 00:56:44,680
Oh! You don't really think,
this is my first chop shop do you?

628
00:56:45,020 --> 00:56:48,730
Oh! Be quiet.
There's more here that meets the eye.

629
00:56:49,530 --> 00:56:52,720
This used to be one of the popular
picture houses in the city.

630
00:56:54,720 --> 00:56:56,880
Movie theater?
Yes.

631
00:56:58,010 --> 00:57:01,039
In the 1930s, a woman named
Mary Elizabeth Woods...

632
00:57:01,040 --> 00:57:04,650
read about a chemical magnate who
created a drive-in theater...

633
00:57:05,050 --> 00:57:06,470
in Camden, New Jersey.

634
00:57:06,870 --> 00:57:10,410
And, so naturally she wanted
one of her own in San Francisco.

635
00:57:10,710 --> 00:57:14,180
Everyone thought she was crazy,
a loony, she was!

636
00:57:14,410 --> 00:57:15,929
He used to sleep with anyone
who was her husband.

637
00:57:15,930 --> 00:57:18,789
And she would put up heirs that
she was better than anyone else.

638
00:57:18,790 --> 00:57:19,890
In fact...

639
00:57:21,862 --> 00:57:22,862
anyway.

640
00:57:23,986 --> 00:57:26,885
Because of local ordinances she
couldn't have an open air theater.

641
00:57:27,472 --> 00:57:29,129
So she brought all
the car in here.

642
00:57:29,680 --> 00:57:30,680
That's the screen,
right there!

643
00:57:32,331 --> 00:57:35,865
It was spectacular...
I imagine.

644
00:57:39,150 --> 00:57:41,824
Are you ready for the best part?
Sure.

645
00:57:42,302 --> 00:57:43,675
Okay.
Look up.

646
00:57:54,268 --> 00:57:57,436
She had illumine scent and
filaments installed.

647
00:58:00,001 --> 00:58:02,915
They took the time to
create the constellations.

648
00:58:05,728 --> 00:58:06,949
Isn't it beautiful?

649
00:58:11,826 --> 00:58:12,826
Yeah.

650
00:58:22,850 --> 00:58:23,850
What are you doing?

651
00:58:24,503 --> 00:58:25,503
Come on.

652
00:58:38,155 --> 00:58:39,155
Cheers.

653
00:58:40,329 --> 00:58:43,397
The great paradox of
all this is that...

654
00:58:43,505 --> 00:58:45,425
the better our instruments get...

655
00:58:45,458 --> 00:58:47,005
that farther we can see...

656
00:58:48,111 --> 00:58:51,300
but not into the future,
into the past.

657
00:58:52,001 --> 00:58:54,703
The events that light
hasn't even reached us yet.

658
00:58:54,814 --> 00:58:58,300
I don't think I'll ever understand
why few people care about history?

659
00:58:58,924 --> 00:59:00,917
The future has its charm too.

660
00:59:03,515 --> 00:59:05,062
We could talk about our ours.

661
00:59:07,474 --> 00:59:10,531
Ellis...
Not the distant future.

662
00:59:11,332 --> 00:59:15,296
Talking about this weekend.
What did you have in mind?

663
00:59:16,198 --> 00:59:20,295
My parents are having a party to celebrate
their 40th wedding anniversary.

664
00:59:20,988 --> 00:59:22,845
It's just a couple
of hours from here.

665
00:59:25,634 --> 00:59:26,634
Come with me.

666
00:59:42,120 --> 00:59:43,450
okay.

667
00:59:45,130 --> 00:59:46,130
Can I drive?

668
00:59:55,300 --> 01:00:00,030
Oh My God! You know you rarely
see a Saab in the Daytona 500.

669
01:00:00,430 --> 01:00:01,860
There's a reason for that.

670
01:00:02,060 --> 01:00:04,289
Equivocally, you might wanna
consider occasional...

671
01:00:04,290 --> 01:00:06,659
tapping that square
metal by your foot.

672
01:00:06,660 --> 01:00:08,290
I do not know what
you're talking about.

673
01:00:10,610 --> 01:00:12,000
Oh my God!

674
01:00:13,260 --> 01:00:14,340
Sorry!

675
01:00:15,710 --> 01:00:16,890
What's wrong with you?

676
01:00:24,310 --> 01:00:26,460
Do me a favor.
Stop to pick her up.

677
01:00:26,660 --> 01:00:29,070
Uh! I rather not get stabbed!

678
01:00:29,970 --> 01:00:30,970
That's my sister.

679
01:00:35,030 --> 01:00:36,030
Sorry.

680
01:00:41,750 --> 01:00:43,850
What's up pussycat?
Need a ride?

681
01:00:44,320 --> 01:00:45,320
What does it look like?

682
01:00:49,080 --> 01:00:51,380
How are you?
Well, hello.

683
01:00:52,530 --> 01:00:55,580
Get out!
Still driving a Saab, huh?

684
01:00:55,880 --> 01:00:57,120
Yeah good seeing you too!
Hey!

685
01:00:57,570 --> 01:00:58,610
Kikki, this is Jenny.

686
01:00:59,760 --> 01:01:01,439
Jenny, this is my sister.

687
01:01:01,440 --> 01:01:03,310
Nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you.

688
01:01:03,710 --> 01:01:05,550
You should have told us
you are taking the bus.

689
01:01:05,940 --> 01:01:07,220
We picked you up at the station.

690
01:01:07,420 --> 01:01:09,370
I stopped using telephones
two months ago.

691
01:01:10,710 --> 01:01:12,440
Any particular reason?

692
01:01:12,980 --> 01:01:15,460
To protest the involvement of
telecomm firms in the development...

693
01:01:15,560 --> 01:01:17,300
of hi-tech weapon systems.

694
01:01:19,140 --> 01:01:20,810
Kikki graduated from Berkeley.

695
01:01:22,450 --> 01:01:24,160
So this is the new one, huh?

696
01:01:26,870 --> 01:01:28,170
Have you done him yet?

697
01:01:29,880 --> 01:01:32,030
Yes, ten minutes ago,
right where you are sitting.

698
01:01:35,700 --> 01:01:39,280
So what's the story with this girl?
She works there?

699
01:01:39,480 --> 01:01:41,230
I told everything Ellis told me.

700
01:01:44,740 --> 01:01:45,740
Thank you.

701
01:01:46,380 --> 01:01:47,630
Beautiful girl...

702
01:01:49,850 --> 01:01:51,500
works in a public library.

703
01:01:52,320 --> 01:01:54,810
Maybe she likes books and silence.

704
01:01:55,120 --> 01:01:56,620
Or maybe she Google'd him...

705
01:01:56,720 --> 01:01:59,870
and he found out about his generous
contributions that then...

706
01:02:00,310 --> 01:02:03,209
worked her way in there and
she can get her hooks into him.

707
01:02:03,210 --> 01:02:04,660
I bet that's it.

708
01:02:05,040 --> 01:02:07,860
Shouldn't they be here by now?
You clear the table.

709
01:02:18,960 --> 01:02:20,000
They are here!

710
01:02:20,480 --> 01:02:21,480
Yeah, yeah.

711
01:02:22,200 --> 01:02:23,200
How do I look?

712
01:02:25,370 --> 01:02:26,370
Very pretty.

713
01:02:32,310 --> 01:02:33,779
Oh! There you are...

714
01:02:33,780 --> 01:02:35,020
Hey, Mom.

715
01:02:35,700 --> 01:02:40,229
Aw Honey! You look great.
Look who we picked up on the way.

716
01:02:40,230 --> 01:02:41,690
Hi.
Hey, baby.

717
01:02:42,980 --> 01:02:45,419
So, this is Jenny.
Hello.

718
01:02:45,420 --> 01:02:47,499
So nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you.

719
01:02:47,500 --> 01:02:49,459
You must be exhausted after your trip.

720
01:02:49,460 --> 01:02:52,770
No, it was nothing.
We did it in like 18 minutes.

721
01:02:52,970 --> 01:02:57,189
No I'm not amused.
You know I hate it when you speed.

722
01:02:57,190 --> 01:03:00,749
It wasn't, it was Jenny.
I swear, she thinks she has nine lives.

723
01:03:00,750 --> 01:03:02,980
Let me take your coat.
Okay.

724
01:03:03,180 --> 01:03:05,720
Where you been?
Forget where we live?

725
01:03:05,815 --> 01:03:07,220
No.

726
01:03:07,320 --> 01:03:09,160
Am, this is my dad, William.

727
01:03:09,360 --> 01:03:11,229
Dad, this is...

728
01:03:11,230 --> 01:03:12,370
Adaline.

729
01:03:19,370 --> 01:03:20,610
Jenny, actually.

730
01:03:25,300 --> 01:03:27,130
Dad, you okay?

731
01:03:29,850 --> 01:03:31,050
I'm sorry, it's just...

732
01:03:32,230 --> 01:03:35,140
you're exactly like this old
friend of mine that I...

733
01:03:36,230 --> 01:03:37,430
Adaline Bowman.

734
01:03:40,250 --> 01:03:41,250
That's my mother.

735
01:03:43,720 --> 01:03:45,179
You joking?
Really?

736
01:03:45,180 --> 01:03:46,850
Yes.
Oh my gosh!

737
01:03:47,150 --> 01:03:48,250
Did you know her?

738
01:03:52,260 --> 01:03:54,230
Yeah!
Yeah!

739
01:03:55,810 --> 01:03:57,670
We were very close.

740
01:03:58,340 --> 01:03:59,760
I, I knew her in London.

741
01:04:00,620 --> 01:04:03,349
Yes, yes she lived
there in the 60s.

742
01:04:03,350 --> 01:04:04,979
Right before she, ah...

743
01:04:04,980 --> 01:04:07,820
moved to Paris and
met my father.

744
01:04:08,120 --> 01:04:10,139
It is incredible.
What are the odds!

745
01:04:10,140 --> 01:04:12,140
Wow, wow.

746
01:04:12,340 --> 01:04:16,720
The resemblance is absolutely amazing.
Must hear it all the time.

747
01:04:17,450 --> 01:04:19,190
For as long as I can remember.

748
01:04:19,390 --> 01:04:21,260
Wow! We were very close.

749
01:04:21,460 --> 01:04:25,250
You've said that already, honey.
I don't believe you've ever mentioned her.

750
01:04:25,450 --> 01:04:27,859
Oh, yeah, I have.
No, no.

751
01:04:27,860 --> 01:04:32,040
I remember your close close friends.
How she doin'?

752
01:04:34,860 --> 01:04:36,030
He passed away.

753
01:04:37,310 --> 01:04:38,690
Six years ago.

754
01:04:39,260 --> 01:04:40,260
No. Really?

755
01:04:42,120 --> 01:04:44,650
Oh! I'm so sorry.

756
01:04:50,310 --> 01:04:52,000
An extraordinary woman.

757
01:04:52,250 --> 01:04:55,030
Yeah, it runs in the family.

758
01:05:01,160 --> 01:05:02,849
Come on, in. Want something to eat?
Yeah.

759
01:05:02,850 --> 01:05:04,870
Yeah, I made cheesecake.

760
01:05:07,010 --> 01:05:08,930
We're kinda tired actually.

761
01:05:09,690 --> 01:05:11,650
I think we'll head up,
if that's ok with you?

762
01:05:12,040 --> 01:05:13,300
Me too.
Really?

763
01:05:13,500 --> 01:05:15,149
Alright.
I'll have you in the back bedroom.

764
01:05:15,150 --> 01:05:16,740
Hi, you're in the back.

765
01:05:18,270 --> 01:05:19,270
Hey.
Hey.

766
01:05:19,310 --> 01:05:21,150
So nice to meet you.

767
01:05:21,900 --> 01:05:23,560
Dad...
Oh, hey.

768
01:05:24,510 --> 01:05:25,510
Hey, baby.

769
01:06:26,610 --> 01:06:27,610
Miss.

770
01:06:29,050 --> 01:06:30,050
Miss.

771
01:06:31,820 --> 01:06:33,489
You keep doing that,
you gonna fudge your engine.

772
01:06:33,490 --> 01:06:35,770
Thank you, thank you
for the useful tip.

773
01:06:36,470 --> 01:06:38,120
Well you gonna get one
hell of a tan at least.

774
01:06:41,910 --> 01:06:45,800
I'm sorry, I've done everything I
could to get this thing started.

775
01:06:45,810 --> 01:06:47,610
Just...it won't.

776
01:06:49,290 --> 01:06:51,020
Alright, all it needs is a push start.

777
01:06:52,170 --> 01:06:54,040
Just loose the brake,
I'll give you a push.

778
01:06:54,450 --> 01:06:56,300
Pop your clutch and
you can take off.

779
01:06:58,100 --> 01:06:59,100
Okay.

780
01:07:01,300 --> 01:07:02,300
Thank you.

781
01:07:04,710 --> 01:07:06,109
Ready?
Ready, you ready?

782
01:07:06,110 --> 01:07:07,110
Okay.
Okay.

783
01:07:09,650 --> 01:07:10,810
Pin and pop your clutch.

784
01:07:13,940 --> 01:07:14,980
Thank you!

785
01:07:18,390 --> 01:07:19,390
You are welcome.

786
01:07:37,610 --> 01:07:39,880
They would spend the next
five weeks together.

787
01:07:40,370 --> 01:07:44,410
And Adaline did something that she
promised herself she would never do.

788
01:07:44,610 --> 01:07:47,680
You know, you still haven't
told me your name?

789
01:07:49,830 --> 01:07:51,040
Adaline Bowman.

790
01:07:52,400 --> 01:07:55,080
But my friends tell me "Della".
That's beautiful.

791
01:07:56,290 --> 01:07:57,290
Thank you.

792
01:07:58,340 --> 01:08:00,740
Three weeks later his
semester completed...

793
01:08:01,320 --> 01:08:03,410
William flew home to,
The United States.

794
01:08:05,670 --> 01:08:07,250
Adaline, came with him.

795
01:08:51,980 --> 01:08:52,980
Hey.

796
01:08:54,470 --> 01:08:55,570
How'd you sleep?

797
01:08:56,330 --> 01:08:57,880
Fine.
Good.

798
01:09:05,310 --> 01:09:08,620
Sorry about last night, I'll never
embarrass you, its just...

799
01:09:11,620 --> 01:09:12,960
Must be losing it.

800
01:09:14,280 --> 01:09:15,280
It's ok.

801
01:09:20,860 --> 01:09:22,290
Hey!
When did you come up?

802
01:09:23,250 --> 01:09:25,270
Not too late, I read for a while.
Hmm...

803
01:09:28,060 --> 01:09:29,060
Hi, baby.

804
01:09:30,470 --> 01:09:32,830
Where's Jenny?
She'll be down in a sec.

805
01:09:33,230 --> 01:09:35,060
She was up all night,
tossing and turning.

806
01:09:36,450 --> 01:09:38,500
You have never told
us how you guys met.

807
01:09:39,260 --> 01:09:42,180
We met in an elevator
on New Year's Eve.

808
01:09:43,280 --> 01:09:45,660
You want some coffee?
No, thank you.

809
01:09:46,150 --> 01:09:48,550
But I had seen her
once before that.

810
01:09:49,066 --> 01:09:50,066
Hey.

811
01:09:50,090 --> 01:09:53,130
Was at the library, she was reading
a book on Braille and I just...

812
01:09:53,830 --> 01:09:55,290
I knew she wasn't original.

813
01:09:55,690 --> 01:09:57,550
Here you go baby.
So was her mom.

814
01:09:58,630 --> 01:10:00,140
How did you meet her mother?

815
01:10:01,400 --> 01:10:02,770
It was outside London.

816
01:10:03,230 --> 01:10:06,480
Her car broke down and
I helped her fix it.

817
01:10:06,880 --> 01:10:10,850
So she was English?
Oh! No,no she was just there to study French.

818
01:10:11,560 --> 01:10:14,450
Spoke like what, four languages?
I think so.

819
01:10:14,460 --> 01:10:15,460
Wow.
Yeah...

820
01:10:15,840 --> 01:10:18,210
Jenny is brilliant with languages too.
Really?

821
01:10:18,860 --> 01:10:21,519
So old were you
when you met her?

822
01:10:21,520 --> 01:10:23,370
Oh! I was about, Um...

823
01:10:23,470 --> 01:10:26,020
say, I was in second year of 
Med School, I was like...

824
01:10:26,710 --> 01:10:27,710
...26.

825
01:10:29,800 --> 01:10:33,320
I was thinkin' of quitting medicine,
I was bored.

826
01:10:34,230 --> 01:10:35,230
But I was...

827
01:10:36,620 --> 01:10:39,250
I was afraid, I was too
old to start again.

828
01:10:40,900 --> 01:10:41,900
I told...

829
01:10:43,460 --> 01:10:46,480
I told Adaline about it
and she laughed at my face.

830
01:10:46,870 --> 01:10:50,540
She said, "Go for it",
don't be silly.

831
01:10:50,970 --> 01:10:52,380
Life is too short.

832
01:10:53,050 --> 01:10:57,390
If not for her, I probably wouldn't
have found astronomy, physics.

833
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:01,149
She was only couple of years older,
but she was so wise.

834
01:11:01,150 --> 01:11:02,750
And so...

835
01:11:03,030 --> 01:11:04,090
so sophisticated.

836
01:11:12,880 --> 01:11:13,880
She...

837
01:11:28,030 --> 01:11:30,380
What? Honey!
That's enough, Williams!

838
01:11:31,290 --> 01:11:33,750
What, what's wrong?

839
01:11:33,890 --> 01:11:35,600
Oh! You think this is funny?

840
01:11:36,230 --> 01:11:38,320
What do you mean? What did...
What did I do?

841
01:11:38,420 --> 01:11:43,130
You were very close, very close.
You've said that twice.

842
01:11:43,950 --> 01:11:46,679
You should see your face
when you talk about her.

843
01:11:46,680 --> 01:11:49,570
Are you going to wax nostalgics
the whole goddamn weekend?

844
01:11:49,580 --> 01:11:51,760
Look, it's just...

845
01:11:51,840 --> 01:11:55,059
she looks so much like her mother and
then I'm remembering things that I...

846
01:11:55,060 --> 01:11:57,259
not even I remembered.

847
01:11:57,260 --> 01:11:59,789
Well I hate like feeling
of a second choice.

848
01:11:59,790 --> 01:12:01,590
What do you mean?
Especially this weekend.

849
01:12:01,620 --> 01:12:03,109
Second choice?
Yes.

850
01:12:03,110 --> 01:12:05,570
Forty years, baby.
Come on...

851
01:12:06,070 --> 01:12:07,680
Second choice?
No, no.

852
01:12:08,400 --> 01:12:10,990
Honey, you're blowing this
all out of proportion.

853
01:12:11,100 --> 01:12:12,100
Am I?

854
01:12:12,700 --> 01:12:14,060
You are jealous?

855
01:12:16,690 --> 01:12:18,310
Yeah, as a matter of fact.

856
01:12:19,550 --> 01:12:20,850
Look, look...

857
01:12:21,640 --> 01:12:23,270
It was fleeting,

858
01:12:24,270 --> 01:12:25,880
inconsequential.

859
01:12:28,340 --> 01:12:30,470
Sounded like it was
more than that.

860
01:12:33,100 --> 01:12:34,210
I love you.

861
01:12:35,100 --> 01:12:37,640
I love you too.
Come here.

862
01:12:57,080 --> 01:12:58,080
I'm coming!

863
01:13:00,360 --> 01:13:02,800
It's not the most romantic weekend.

864
01:13:03,100 --> 01:13:04,770
Thanks for being
such a good sport.

865
01:13:05,180 --> 01:13:07,650
Of course!
I promise I'll make it up to ya.

866
01:13:21,500 --> 01:13:24,020
Sorry about my dad.
It's really embarrassing.

867
01:13:25,550 --> 01:13:26,550
He's lovely.

868
01:13:29,200 --> 01:13:31,690
Yeah, your mom must have
really meant something.

869
01:13:33,800 --> 01:13:35,080
Yes she was.

870
01:13:42,440 --> 01:13:43,440
Kikki!

871
01:13:45,390 --> 01:13:46,670
So, guys...
I don't know...

872
01:13:46,970 --> 01:13:49,890
Dad is running a
47 game winning streak.

873
01:13:50,590 --> 01:13:52,549
All the money I spent
on your education...

874
01:13:52,550 --> 01:13:54,580
I was hoping for
stronger competition.

875
01:13:54,680 --> 01:13:56,800
Have you played this before?
No never.

876
01:13:56,810 --> 01:13:59,150
Kikki, come on!
Do I have to?

877
01:13:59,260 --> 01:14:00,650
Yeah!
Yes!

878
01:14:01,420 --> 01:14:05,089
The idea is to get enough
of these little wedges...

879
01:14:05,090 --> 01:14:06,910
Pie!
They're cheese.

880
01:14:07,390 --> 01:14:11,100
They're wedges!
You gotta have enough of those in the circle to win.

881
01:14:11,400 --> 01:14:12,100
Ok?

882
01:14:12,101 --> 01:14:14,720
Most of the questions
are stupendous stuff!

883
01:14:15,100 --> 01:14:16,589
Hence the word "Trivial".

884
01:14:16,590 --> 01:14:18,120
Yeah! Like here's an example for you..
Umm...

885
01:14:18,860 --> 01:14:22,209
"On June 22, 1938,
this American boxer...

886
01:14:22,210 --> 01:14:24,499
retained his heavyweight championship...

887
01:14:24,500 --> 01:14:27,410
when he beat Max Schmeling,
in the first round".

888
01:14:27,980 --> 01:14:31,180
Well that is a tough one.
I know, what do you think?

889
01:14:34,890 --> 01:14:35,890
Sony Liston?

890
01:14:36,400 --> 01:14:38,510
Joe Louis.
Good guess though, really.

891
01:14:39,680 --> 01:14:42,439
Yeah, women and boxing.
It's cute.

892
01:14:42,440 --> 01:14:43,910
Excuse me?
Do you know, what that is?

893
01:14:45,530 --> 01:14:47,150
You know what, fine ladies.
We are on this.

894
01:14:47,160 --> 01:14:48,640
Here, roll the die.
Well here we go.

895
01:14:49,360 --> 01:14:50,360
Alright, here we go.

896
01:14:50,960 --> 01:14:51,960
Women are pink.

897
01:14:52,930 --> 01:14:53,930
Women are pink?

898
01:14:58,040 --> 01:15:01,719
"Who is the first United States
President to be born in a hospital."

899
01:15:01,720 --> 01:15:02,720
Jimmy Carter.

900
01:15:07,210 --> 01:15:08,210
Jimmy Carter.

901
01:15:10,076 --> 01:15:11,076
It's fast.

902
01:15:11,100 --> 01:15:13,880
Beginners luck.
I do not think so! Try again.

903
01:15:17,480 --> 01:15:20,550
At what event did the 'hula hula hoop'
make its debut?

904
01:15:22,160 --> 01:15:27,490
In 1956, at the World's Fair in
Schenectady, New York.

905
01:15:30,930 --> 01:15:33,729
1956 World's Fair,
Schnecdady, New York.

906
01:15:33,730 --> 01:15:35,520
Oh My God.

907
01:15:36,860 --> 01:15:38,220
Nice one!
Wow.

908
01:15:39,410 --> 01:15:41,290
Cheese.
Pie.

909
01:15:42,450 --> 01:15:43,470
Wedge.

910
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:48,859
Alright, come on.
Let's do this.

911
01:15:48,860 --> 01:15:50,839
What, too much pressure?
Do you smell something?

912
01:15:50,840 --> 01:15:52,880
That your winning streak
going up in smoke?

913
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:55,510
We used to have this family joke.

914
01:15:55,710 --> 01:15:58,990
What would happen first?
Dad loses intrevial pursuit...

915
01:15:59,500 --> 01:16:01,580
or Della finally appears?

916
01:16:03,570 --> 01:16:04,570
"Della"?

917
01:16:04,740 --> 01:16:07,980
Yeah? You remember the comet I told you about,
that my dad discovered ?

918
01:16:08,180 --> 01:16:11,060
He named it "Della C 1981".

919
01:16:11,900 --> 01:16:14,350
After my great Aunt Adele.

920
01:16:14,950 --> 01:16:16,210
Okay, let's go!
Yeah?

921
01:16:16,410 --> 01:16:18,240
Come on dad.
Here we go.

922
01:16:19,050 --> 01:16:20,050
Jenny.

923
01:16:21,630 --> 01:16:22,910
For the win.,,

924
01:16:24,650 --> 01:16:27,119
"Of what country was
Albert Einstein offered...

925
01:16:27,120 --> 01:16:30,310
the presidency in 1952?"

926
01:16:36,200 --> 01:16:37,200
Israel.

927
01:16:40,030 --> 01:16:41,030
Israel.

928
01:16:47,770 --> 01:16:49,869
It's okay.
We still love you.

929
01:16:49,870 --> 01:16:53,280
How does it feel dad?
Are you sad?

930
01:16:54,060 --> 01:16:55,060
I'm alright.

931
01:16:57,440 --> 01:16:59,849
Let's look page two, alright?

932
01:16:59,850 --> 01:17:01,860
Section three, paragraph H.

933
01:17:03,100 --> 01:17:05,579
I'm sorry.
It's okay, it's time for my walk.

934
01:17:05,580 --> 01:17:06,580
OK.

935
01:17:13,830 --> 01:17:15,850
Yes, lets look at 10.

936
01:17:36,290 --> 01:17:38,790
How many stars you think
there are in our galaxy?

937
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:43,890
I do not know.
Five hundred million.

938
01:17:45,850 --> 01:17:47,820
Coupla 100 billion.

939
01:17:53,920 --> 01:17:55,000
Plato believed that...

940
01:17:56,500 --> 01:18:00,510
every soul has a companion star
that returns to after death.

941
01:18:01,111 --> 01:18:03,041
If he lived a moral life.

942
01:18:03,939 --> 01:18:04,939
You believe that?

943
01:18:06,049 --> 01:18:07,476
No, no.
I'm a...

944
01:18:08,596 --> 01:18:11,515
I am a scientist,
Plato was a philosopher.

945
01:18:12,873 --> 01:18:13,873
Poet.

946
01:18:20,367 --> 01:18:22,345
Why he you name the
Comet after my mother?

947
01:18:27,351 --> 01:18:31,257
If my calculations were correct,
that turned out to be wrong...

948
01:18:31,458 --> 01:18:34,584
it would have been the closest
approach to the earth.

949
01:18:34,585 --> 01:18:35,881
Any comet, in...

950
01:18:36,382 --> 01:18:37,572
200 years.

951
01:18:39,250 --> 01:18:40,250
In other words...

952
01:18:41,764 --> 01:18:42,927
like your mother...

953
01:18:44,360 --> 01:18:45,439
a near miss.

954
01:18:48,104 --> 01:18:49,594
What does that mean?

955
01:18:54,492 --> 01:18:56,549
I was gonna propose her.

956
01:19:00,578 --> 01:19:01,616
I had...

957
01:19:02,631 --> 01:19:05,409
I had an engagement
ring in my pocket.

958
01:19:08,423 --> 01:19:09,919
She stood me up.

959
01:19:15,438 --> 01:19:16,553
Near miss.

960
01:19:17,939 --> 01:19:18,939
Good night.

961
01:19:26,400 --> 01:19:27,402
William.

962
01:19:31,791 --> 01:19:33,221
She loved you too.

963
01:19:55,236 --> 01:19:56,236
Wow.

964
01:19:57,691 --> 01:20:01,024
Have we just met?
Right?

965
01:20:01,124 --> 01:20:01,924
I know that.

966
01:20:04,014 --> 01:20:06,102
Yeah, I should probably
shut up right now.

967
01:20:10,689 --> 01:20:11,828
I'll just shut up.

968
01:20:12,717 --> 01:20:14,278
Come on, what?

969
01:20:19,516 --> 01:20:20,516
What is it?

970
01:20:20,517 --> 01:20:23,348
I, I just can't tell you the truth.

971
01:20:25,023 --> 01:20:27,192
I cannot imagine my life without you.

972
01:20:28,399 --> 01:20:31,112
I know this is probably the last
that you wanna hear right now.

973
01:20:34,139 --> 01:20:35,973
But I am falling in
love with you, Jenny.

974
01:20:37,109 --> 01:20:38,285
I can not help it.

975
01:20:43,636 --> 01:20:45,423
I do not know what to say.

976
01:20:49,621 --> 01:20:50,868
I did not expect...

977
01:20:51,391 --> 01:20:55,073
Please, don't say anything, alright?
I just wanted you to know how I feel.

978
01:21:13,641 --> 01:21:14,641
Oh! Hello.

979
01:21:14,930 --> 01:21:15,930
Jenny.

980
01:21:17,123 --> 01:21:18,619
Do you know where
everyone went?

981
01:21:19,120 --> 01:21:23,585
Yeah, Kathy, Kikki went to the
market and Ellis went for a run.

982
01:21:23,586 --> 01:21:27,023
Okay.
Hold on! You have a bug in your hair.

983
01:21:27,424 --> 01:21:28,632
It's ok.
What it is?

984
01:21:28,633 --> 01:21:30,118
It's a ladybug.

985
01:21:31,673 --> 01:21:33,168
They say they're good luck.

986
01:21:35,199 --> 01:21:36,199
Did you get it?

987
01:21:37,712 --> 01:21:39,961
I got it.
Thank you.

988
01:21:44,762 --> 01:21:46,993
Please tell Ellis,
I went for a walk.

989
01:22:34,227 --> 01:22:36,127
Della you ok?
Oh my God!

990
01:22:53,367 --> 01:22:55,503
This will sting.
Ok.

991
01:23:06,717 --> 01:23:08,683
Don't worry, I'll fix you.
Okay.

992
01:23:13,677 --> 01:23:15,408
Oh! Oh!

993
01:23:41,729 --> 01:23:42,984
Excuse me.
Hi.

994
01:23:44,281 --> 01:23:45,441
Do you mind taking our photo?

995
01:23:45,442 --> 01:23:47,117
Yeah.

996
01:23:47,218 --> 01:23:48,218
It's ok, I don't.

997
01:23:48,610 --> 01:23:51,258
It's going to be great, come on.
I do not like photos.

998
01:23:51,259 --> 01:23:54,252
You will love it.
We're wasting film.

999
01:23:54,253 --> 01:23:56,542
Of course not.
I'm just very shy.

1000
01:23:56,543 --> 01:23:59,307
Three, two, one...

1001
01:24:49,933 --> 01:24:50,933
I know.

1002
01:24:53,500 --> 01:24:55,694
I know who you are, Adaline.

1003
01:24:58,767 --> 01:24:59,767
What?

1004
01:25:02,190 --> 01:25:05,239
The scar.
It's the same scar.

1005
01:25:05,352 --> 01:25:07,123
I stitched it myself.

1006
01:25:09,331 --> 01:25:10,331
Please.

1007
01:25:13,399 --> 01:25:14,399
The truth.

1008
01:25:24,309 --> 01:25:25,309
William.

1009
01:25:33,043 --> 01:25:35,193
I thought I was losing my mind.

1010
01:25:37,749 --> 01:25:41,669
How? How is this possible?

1011
01:25:47,009 --> 01:25:48,447
I don't know.

1012
01:25:50,972 --> 01:25:53,315
I...I, I was normal.

1013
01:25:56,161 --> 01:25:58,787
And then one day...
I just stopped.

1014
01:26:01,140 --> 01:26:03,519
I wanted to tell you so badly.

1015
01:26:04,824 --> 01:26:05,916
But I couldn't.

1016
01:26:07,287 --> 01:26:09,014
You know what they do to me.
I...

1017
01:26:09,921 --> 01:26:12,245
I would have been a...
Curiosity?

1018
01:26:14,879 --> 01:26:16,081
A specimen.
Yes.

1019
01:26:21,489 --> 01:26:23,040
That's why you left me?

1020
01:26:24,411 --> 01:26:27,756
That's why you...disappeared?

1021
01:26:34,583 --> 01:26:36,402
You can't imagine how much it hurt.

1022
01:26:39,217 --> 01:26:40,720
I think, I...

1023
01:26:41,440 --> 01:26:42,702
I think I can.

1024
01:26:47,857 --> 01:26:49,479
You never told anyone?

1025
01:26:51,083 --> 01:26:52,083
No.

1026
01:26:53,219 --> 01:26:56,201
If I had, would have been Ellis.

1027
01:27:01,777 --> 01:27:04,086
Don't, don't run away.

1028
01:27:05,238 --> 01:27:07,968
Don't disappear again, please.
For Ellis.

1029
01:27:09,240 --> 01:27:10,885
Adaline...
Please.

1030
01:27:14,134 --> 01:27:18,333
All these years, you have
lived but never had a life.

1031
01:27:19,831 --> 01:27:22,255
Please, for yourself, for Ellis.

1032
01:27:23,531 --> 01:27:24,967
Stay, Adaline.

1033
01:27:26,211 --> 01:27:27,300
I don't know how.

1034
01:27:27,917 --> 01:27:30,409
Do not run away, Adaline.
Adaline!

1035
01:27:31,132 --> 01:27:32,132
Adaline!

1036
01:28:49,503 --> 01:28:52,275
Adaline don't, don't.
No. Adaline, please.

1037
01:28:53,396 --> 01:28:54,546
Please don't do this.

1038
01:28:54,687 --> 01:28:58,288
Adaline, don't.
Think about Ellis, please!

1039
01:28:59,034 --> 01:29:01,252
Adaline, please!
Adaline!

1040
01:29:27,066 --> 01:29:30,093
Ellis, I'm so sorry. I can't do this.
I can't explain. Jenny.

1041
01:29:38,996 --> 01:29:41,571
Dad! Dad!

1042
01:29:42,737 --> 01:29:44,039
Dad, where're your keys?

1043
01:29:48,349 --> 01:29:49,759
She's gone.

1044
01:29:55,834 --> 01:29:58,008
She's not coming back, son.

1045
01:29:59,127 --> 01:30:01,902
What just happened?
What, what is this?

1046
01:30:03,419 --> 01:30:06,334
Dad, what the hell did you say to her?
Nothing.

1047
01:30:08,998 --> 01:30:10,421
She can't explain.

1048
01:30:11,172 --> 01:30:13,398
Please tell me what she said.

1049
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:17,834
She is not capable.

1050
01:30:18,602 --> 01:30:19,602
Of what?

1051
01:30:24,903 --> 01:30:26,349
Of change.

1052
01:30:53,625 --> 01:30:54,680
Do you love her?

1053
01:30:56,090 --> 01:30:57,090
Son?

1054
01:30:58,231 --> 01:31:00,460
Listen to me.
Do you love her?

1055
01:31:01,337 --> 01:31:02,337
Yes.

1056
01:31:05,524 --> 01:31:06,524
How do you know?

1057
01:31:07,183 --> 01:31:10,202
Dad, I don't...
It's a simple question.

1058
01:31:11,431 --> 01:31:12,431
How do you know?

1059
01:31:15,441 --> 01:31:17,342
Because nothing makes
sense about her.

1060
01:32:22,593 --> 01:32:23,888
Hello?

1061
01:32:25,114 --> 01:32:26,937
Honey, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to wake you.

1062
01:32:27,055 --> 01:32:29,593
Everything ok?
No, no...I just wanted to tell you...

1063
01:32:30,073 --> 01:32:31,073
What is it?

1064
01:32:32,450 --> 01:32:34,321
You're right.
No more running.

1065
01:32:34,432 --> 01:32:37,813
Mom?
I'll call you tomorrow, okay ?

1066
01:32:37,965 --> 01:32:40,484
I am so happy to hear that.
I love you.

1067
01:32:40,631 --> 01:32:42,336
I love you too.
Bye.

1068
01:32:42,443 --> 01:32:43,443
Bye, Mama.

1069
01:33:57,071 --> 01:34:00,106
The moon is responsible for
much of what takes place...

1070
01:34:00,178 --> 01:34:01,583
on the surface of the Earth.

1071
01:34:02,310 --> 01:34:06,487
A stray meteorite hit
the Moon in 1178.

1072
01:34:07,282 --> 01:34:09,474
The resulting concussion
would cause extreme tides...

1073
01:34:09,623 --> 01:34:13,178
on every lunar phase in
Tierra del Fuego, Argentina.

1074
01:34:13,898 --> 01:34:17,417
A 23% rise in the mean
tide of of this night...

1075
01:34:17,920 --> 01:34:21,485
produced a storm 2000 miles
off the Pacific Coast...

1076
01:34:23,143 --> 01:34:27,351
causing an increase in amount of
molecular ionization in the atmosphere.

1077
01:34:28,832 --> 01:34:31,320
And for the first time in 78 years...

1078
01:34:32,515 --> 01:34:36,125
snow fell in this part
of Sonoma County.

1079
01:34:40,250 --> 01:34:42,759
In the early stages
of hypothermia...

1080
01:34:42,875 --> 01:34:46,717
the body will try to generate
heat through shivering.

1081
01:34:48,123 --> 01:34:51,470
When this fails, it would
decrease the flow of blood...

1082
01:34:51,612 --> 01:34:52,612
in the extremities.

1083
01:34:53,995 --> 01:34:56,900
Metabolism slows
down to a crawl.

1084
01:34:58,415 --> 01:35:01,112
You are dying, but you don't know it.

1085
01:35:03,172 --> 01:35:04,467
In the final stages...

1086
01:35:05,117 --> 01:35:08,069
the victim only breathes
once or twice a minute.

1087
01:35:09,478 --> 01:35:11,756
A state of suspended animation .

1088
01:35:39,048 --> 01:35:40,048
Jenny!

1089
01:35:40,950 --> 01:35:42,676
At 10:07 PM...

1090
01:35:42,818 --> 01:35:47,753
Bowman Adaline's core temperature
had dropped to 87 degrees.

1091
01:35:49,205 --> 01:35:51,859
Her heart stopped beating.

1092
01:36:14,311 --> 01:36:15,401
At last...

1093
01:36:16,052 --> 01:36:18,284
to the age of 107 years...

1094
01:36:19,120 --> 01:36:23,646
Adaline Bowman was,
by any definition, dead.

1095
01:36:33,064 --> 01:36:35,549
Exactly precisely 10:09 PM...

1096
01:36:35,661 --> 01:36:39,937
paramedics placed put two defibrillator
paddles on Adaline Bowman's chest.

1097
01:36:41,483 --> 01:36:44,149
They counted the prescribed
five seconds...

1098
01:36:44,264 --> 01:36:47,752
before administering 
750 volts of electricity.

1099
01:38:03,980 --> 01:38:04,980
How is she?

1100
01:38:05,004 --> 01:38:06,737
We've just run a series of tests...

1101
01:38:06,889 --> 01:38:09,086
and don't see any
long term damage.

1102
01:38:09,994 --> 01:38:11,234
It's quite remarkable, in fact.

1103
01:38:11,809 --> 01:38:13,472
Is she awake?
Can I go see her?

1104
01:38:13,621 --> 01:38:16,488
She is exhausted but you
might get in for few words.

1105
01:38:18,103 --> 01:38:19,123
Okay, thank you.

1106
01:38:35,997 --> 01:38:36,997
Hi.

1107
01:38:42,161 --> 01:38:43,161
Jenny?

1108
01:38:44,929 --> 01:38:45,929
Hi.

1109
01:38:45,985 --> 01:38:46,985
Hey!

1110
01:39:02,520 --> 01:39:03,748
I know why you ran away.

1111
01:39:06,608 --> 01:39:07,608
You do?

1112
01:39:08,786 --> 01:39:11,376
That's because of what I said
to you last night, wasn't it?

1113
01:39:12,331 --> 01:39:14,357
I told you, I loved you.

1114
01:39:15,597 --> 01:39:19,073
And you got scared...
Come here, I love you.

1115
01:39:28,582 --> 01:39:30,278
I love you too.

1116
01:39:50,413 --> 01:39:51,421
There's something else.

1117
01:39:59,736 --> 01:40:02,463
What?
What is it?

1118
01:40:11,235 --> 01:40:12,235
Well, first...

1119
01:40:14,079 --> 01:40:15,765
My name isn't Jenny.

1120
01:40:28,000 --> 01:40:29,812
My God.
What happened?

1121
01:40:29,974 --> 01:40:32,206
Nothing, nothing.
An accident, I'm fine okay.

1122
01:40:33,907 --> 01:40:34,915
I'm better than fine.
Okay?

1123
01:40:38,060 --> 01:40:40,378
This is Ellis.
Hello.

1124
01:40:40,486 --> 01:40:43,540
Hello.
He's the man, I've been telling you about.

1125
01:40:48,232 --> 01:40:49,451
Nice to meet you.

1126
01:40:51,503 --> 01:40:53,987
I'm Jenny's grandmother.

1127
01:41:03,066 --> 01:41:05,129
What?
What is it?

1128
01:41:06,984 --> 01:41:08,175
He knows.

1129
01:41:13,855 --> 01:41:14,855
He knows!

1130
01:41:36,990 --> 01:41:38,439
Hey, everybody!
I don't wanna ruin the fun...

1131
01:41:38,440 --> 01:41:40,830
but I want to say something.
First of all thanks...

1132
01:41:41,130 --> 01:41:45,179
Kathy and I are really grateful
that they you are all here.

1133
01:41:45,180 --> 01:41:46,460
It means a lot to us...

1134
01:41:47,550 --> 01:41:50,209
that you would be with
us and help celebrate...

1135
01:41:50,210 --> 01:41:51,370
our first...

1136
01:41:51,670 --> 01:41:54,190
first 40 years of her marriage.

1137
01:41:55,600 --> 01:41:58,450
When I first met this lovely lady...

1138
01:42:00,180 --> 01:42:01,600
back in the olden days...

1139
01:42:04,420 --> 01:42:08,579
I had a pretty good idea,
what I wanted to do in my job...

1140
01:42:08,580 --> 01:42:12,610
but I didn't really...

1141
01:42:13,720 --> 01:42:15,010
know what I wanted to...

1142
01:42:16,890 --> 01:42:20,880
be as a man when I grew up,
If they ever grew up.

1143
01:42:24,140 --> 01:42:26,620
But the commitment that she made...

1144
01:42:27,320 --> 01:42:31,150
to our marriage and
to our family, to me...

1145
01:42:31,910 --> 01:42:35,770
The...quality of her love...

1146
01:42:37,570 --> 01:42:39,079
led me to understand...

1147
01:42:39,080 --> 01:42:43,749
that I have no greatest
ambition in life, than...

1148
01:42:43,750 --> 01:42:45,480
to be the best...

1149
01:42:46,950 --> 01:42:50,030
possible husband
I could be for her.

1150
01:42:50,530 --> 01:42:52,380
And I'm still working on it.

1151
01:42:55,520 --> 01:42:59,430
So here's to Kathy,
love of my life...

1152
01:43:01,420 --> 01:43:05,600
mate of my soul, mother
of my lovely children.

1153
01:43:07,640 --> 01:43:08,660
To Kathy.

1154
01:43:18,430 --> 01:43:20,680
One Year later

1155
01:43:23,000 --> 01:43:25,589
We are live, back in Times Square...

1156
01:43:25,590 --> 01:43:28,779
a few minutes from now
what have been waiting for.

1157
01:43:28,780 --> 01:43:30,729
The drop ball to 2014.

1158
01:43:30,730 --> 01:43:33,550
Here you go, honey.
Good girl.

1159
01:43:38,480 --> 01:43:42,519
Hey, you guys. You better hurry up,
you're gonna be late for the event.

1160
01:43:42,520 --> 01:43:45,789
I been ready for 10 minutes.
Oh! So handsome.

1161
01:43:45,790 --> 01:43:46,790
Thank you.

1162
01:43:46,990 --> 01:43:47,990
I ready too.

1163
01:43:48,840 --> 01:43:49,840
Wow.

1164
01:43:49,980 --> 01:43:51,060
I just need the zip.

1165
01:43:51,730 --> 01:43:53,179
Are you sure you don't
wanna come with us?

1166
01:43:53,180 --> 01:43:54,700
Hmm! I'm positive.

1167
01:43:55,950 --> 01:43:59,120
I got my date, right here.
Come here baby.

1168
01:44:01,390 --> 01:44:03,229
I love you.
Love you.

1169
01:44:03,230 --> 01:44:06,559
I'll to grab my clutch....
and my camera.

1170
01:44:06,660 --> 01:44:09,780
His whiskers are so big.
Yeah.

1171
01:44:43,360 --> 01:44:45,090
Adaline, you okay?

1172
01:44:49,590 --> 01:44:50,590
Yes.

1173
01:44:54,750 --> 01:44:55,750
Perfect.

1174
01:44:58,710 --> 01:45:00,759
The instant Adaline's
heart was struck...

1175
01:45:00,760 --> 01:45:02,860
by the defibrillator paddles.

1176
01:45:03,800 --> 01:45:07,440
The telemir structure in her
genes regained their pliability

1177
01:45:08,170 --> 01:45:11,500
Causing her to resume,
the natural course of aging.

1178
01:45:12,800 --> 01:45:14,690
William was right after all.

1179
01:45:15,370 --> 01:45:18,660
The comet "Della C 1981"
did finally return.

1180
01:45:19,540 --> 01:45:20,820
A half century late.

1181
01:45:21,520 --> 01:45:25,000
But as bright and magnificent
as he had predicted.
