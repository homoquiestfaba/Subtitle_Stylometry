00:00:20,088 --> 00:00:22,456

00:00:29,163 --> 00:00:32,032
I live in a dump,
becausethe rent's real low.

00:00:32,133 --> 00:00:35,002
Got a little pet
Blobbie who loves me so.

hideously deformed.

14
00:00:58,092 --> 00:01:02,463
Hey, I'm sitting on

It's a horrible way to go.

00:01:35,863 --> 00:01:37,765
I love this town!

29
00:01:37,865 --> 00:01:40,301
Do you know why
I love this town?

30
00:01:40,401 --> 00:01:41,802
Because you own it?

31
00:01:41,902 --> 00:01:45,573
Because it's the most
polluted city in the world.

32
00:01:45,673 --> 00:01:49,577
And I, Dr. Killemoff,
made it that way.

Look.

34
00:01:50,611 --> 00:01:52,413
I know you're an
evil genius, doc.

What I don't know
is where you want

36
00:01:54,114 --> 00:01:56,284
me to dump this grossoleum 90.

37
00:01:56,384 --> 00:01:59,887
Ah, yes, grossoleum,

00:02:02,223 --> 00:02:04,725
Dump it in the last

in New Jersey-- Tromaville.

41
00:02:07,628 --> 00:02:10,298
I don't know if that's
such a good idea, doc.

42
00:02:10,398 --> 00:02:12,333
What if some complete
and hopeless nerd

43
00:02:12,433 --> 00:02:14,468
falls into the
grossoleum and transforms

44
00:02:14,568 --> 00:02:17,471
into a hideously deformed
creature of superhuman size

45
00:02:17,571 --> 00:02:18,872

Oh, I wish I wasn't a
complete and hopeless nerd.

00:02:26,547 --> 00:02:29,783
Maybe then I'd have a girlfriend
who loves me for who I am.

50
00:02:29,883 --> 00:02:33,053
Or at least confuses
me with someone else.

Oh, yeah.

73
00:03:13,627 --> 00:03:16,497
In fact, I think it's time
I dumped scuzzy old Bonehead

74
00:03:16,597 --> 00:03:19,733
and started dating a
really cute guy like you.

know each other better?

do me one big favor?

No.

outfit on our date tonight.

190
00:07:28,281 --> 00:07:28,982
Whoa.

191
00:07:29,082 --> 00:07:30,283
Look, fellas.

192
00:07:30,383 --> 00:07:32,486
It's Melvin the mop boy.

193
00:07:32,586 --> 00:07:35,322
Your days of picking on
nerds and accordion players

194
00:07:35,422 --> 00:07:36,790
are over, Bonehead.

195
00:07:36,890 --> 00:07:39,927
Let's get him.

196
00:07:40,027 --> 00:07:40,928
[grunt]

197
00:07:42,429 --> 00:07:44,865
This'll teach you to mess with
a hideously deformed creature

198
00:07:44,965 --> 00:07:47,601
of superhuman size and strength.

199
00:07:47,701 --> 00:07:50,003
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

200
00:07:50,103 --> 00:07:50,971
[scream]

201
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:55,576
Hey, man!

202
00:07:55,676 --> 00:07:57,144
What's happening to me?

203
00:07:57,244 --> 00:08:00,581
I better get out of here!

204
00:08:00,681 --> 00:08:02,082
Feel lucky, punk?

205
00:08:02,182 --> 00:08:05,252
Not really, no.

206
00:08:05,352 --> 00:08:06,053
Whoa!

207
00:08:10,123 --> 00:08:11,191
Are you OK?

208
00:08:11,291 --> 00:08:12,425
Fine, thanks to you.

209
00:08:12,526 --> 00:08:14,762
I did lose my contact lenses
so I can't see too good.

210
00:08:14,862 --> 00:08:15,563
Gosh.

211
00:08:15,663 --> 00:08:17,497
You're very handsome.

212
00:08:17,598 --> 00:08:20,734
Boy, this really
is my lucky day.

213
00:08:25,372 --> 00:08:26,073
Yvonne.

214
00:08:26,173 --> 00:08:26,874
Gee.

215
00:08:26,974 --> 00:08:27,941
That's a pretty name.

216
00:08:28,041 --> 00:08:29,042
Thanks.

217
00:08:29,142 --> 00:08:30,944
It means pretty girl
who walks in sunlight.

218
00:08:31,044 --> 00:08:32,212
Or big, rusty pooper scooper.

219
00:08:32,312 --> 00:08:33,080
I forget which.

220
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:33,981
So what should I call you?

221
00:08:34,081 --> 00:08:35,683
Well, I used tobe called Melvin,

222
00:08:35,783 --> 00:08:38,719
but now that I've had a small
accident with toxic chemicals,

223
00:08:38,819 --> 00:08:39,887
I think I need a new name.

224
00:08:39,987 --> 00:08:40,854
[gasp]

225
00:08:40,954 --> 00:08:42,455
How about if I
call you Chemicals?

226
00:08:42,556 --> 00:08:43,791
Or [inaudible]?

227
00:08:43,891 --> 00:08:45,225
Or how about---Toxie.

228
00:08:45,325 --> 00:08:46,126
That's it.

229
00:08:46,226 --> 00:08:48,528
You can call me Toxie.

230
00:08:48,629 --> 00:08:49,830
Uh oh.

231
00:08:49,930 --> 00:08:51,832
I'm getting that
weird feeling again.

232
00:08:51,932 --> 00:08:53,433
Something evil is happening.

233
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:55,168
And it's happening real close.

234
00:08:55,268 --> 00:08:56,570
BOY: Help!

235
00:08:56,670 --> 00:08:59,539
Bad guys are going to destroy
our orphanage so they can build

236
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:01,575
a poisonous chemical plant!

237
00:09:01,675 --> 00:09:02,409
Hm.

238
00:09:02,509 --> 00:09:04,211
Where could that evil be?

239
00:09:04,311 --> 00:09:05,412
Huh?

240
00:09:05,512 --> 00:09:08,649
Hey, bad guys are trying
to destroy that orphanage.

241
00:09:08,749 --> 00:09:10,283
That's not right.

242
00:09:10,383 --> 00:09:11,518
[squeaking]

243
00:09:11,619 --> 00:09:12,986
And my mop is alive.

244
00:09:13,086 --> 00:09:15,455
I bet that happened when it
fell into the toxic chemicals

245
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:16,256
with me.

246
00:09:16,356 --> 00:09:17,257
OK, Mop.

247
00:09:17,357 --> 00:09:19,526
Let's you and me
clean up this mess.

248
00:09:28,201 --> 00:09:29,169
Have no fear.

249
00:09:29,269 --> 00:09:30,403
Toxie's here.

250
00:09:30,503 --> 00:09:31,972
Let go of her, you creep!

251
00:09:35,342 --> 00:09:37,577
Oh, thank you, Toxie.

252
00:09:37,678 --> 00:09:39,079
You're welcome, sweetheart.

253
00:09:39,179 --> 00:09:40,447
Now please step aside.

254
00:09:40,547 --> 00:09:44,184
A battle against evil is
no place for a little girl.

255
00:09:44,284 --> 00:09:45,085
Whoa!

256
00:09:45,185 --> 00:09:46,453
Are you all right?

257
00:09:46,553 --> 00:09:47,520
I'm having a ball!

258
00:09:51,091 --> 00:09:52,459
[screams]

259
00:09:57,030 --> 00:09:57,898
Ha!

260
00:09:57,998 --> 00:09:58,699
Ha ha!

261
00:10:01,234 --> 00:10:01,935
Hey.

262
00:10:02,035 --> 00:10:03,671
You shot my tutu.

263
00:10:03,771 --> 00:10:11,078
Now I'm really mad
Excuse me, but I need

264
00:10:11,178 --> 00:10:12,813
this vehicle to fight evil.

265
00:10:12,913 --> 00:10:13,781
[groan]

266
00:10:17,050 --> 00:10:17,751
Whee!

267
00:10:29,730 --> 00:10:31,131
[cheers]

268
00:10:34,868 --> 00:10:35,568
Toxie!

269
00:10:35,669 --> 00:10:36,569
Toxie!

270
00:10:36,670 --> 00:10:37,537
Toxie!

271
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:40,040
Toxie!

272
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:42,910
Can you tell our home viewers
what just happened here?

273
00:10:43,010 --> 00:10:45,578
I'm not sure, but I think my
new boyfriend talks to his mop.

274
00:10:45,679 --> 00:10:46,379
Oh, yeah.

275
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:47,781
I'll tell you what happened.

276
00:10:47,881 --> 00:10:51,618
My son, Melvin Junko, who is now
a hideously deformed creature

277
00:10:51,719 --> 00:10:53,553
with superhuman
size and strength,

278
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:57,725
saved those poor orphans from
being thrown out of their home.

279
00:10:57,825 --> 00:10:59,793
We understand your
name is Melvin Junko.

280
00:10:59,893 --> 00:11:00,627
Not anymore.

281
00:11:00,728 --> 00:11:02,796
From now on, my name is Toxie.

282
00:11:02,896 --> 00:11:04,698
And I'm a crusader
against pollution,

283
00:11:04,798 --> 00:11:06,299
crime, and other stuff.

284
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:10,537
So I guess we could call
you the Toxie Crusader.

285
00:11:10,637 --> 00:11:11,638
Hey, yeah.

286
00:11:11,739 --> 00:11:12,773
I like that.

287
00:11:12,873 --> 00:11:14,241
The Toxic Crusader.

288
00:11:14,341 --> 00:11:16,043
Neat.

289
00:11:16,143 --> 00:11:17,377
No!

290
00:11:17,477 --> 00:11:19,212
How could this be happening?

291
00:11:19,312 --> 00:11:20,814
I told you so.

292
00:11:20,914 --> 00:11:22,115
What did you say?

293
00:11:22,215 --> 00:11:23,316
Nothing.

294
00:11:23,416 --> 00:11:25,118
He must be stopped.

295
00:11:25,218 --> 00:11:28,521
This-- this Toxic
Crusader must be

296
00:11:28,621 --> 00:11:32,625
eradicated or all my
plans to pollute the world

297
00:11:32,726 --> 00:11:33,861
will be destroyed.

298
00:11:33,961 --> 00:11:36,897
Let me take care of
this Toxic Crusader.

299
00:11:36,997 --> 00:11:39,833
Why should I give you the
pleasure of killing him?

300
00:11:39,933 --> 00:11:42,502
Because he did this to me!

301
00:11:42,602 --> 00:11:43,871
All right then.

302
00:11:43,971 --> 00:11:47,440
Do away with him, and you
will be well rewarded.

303
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:48,776
No sweat.

304
00:11:48,876 --> 00:11:52,579
You can say goodbye
to the Toxic Crusader.

305
00:11:52,679 --> 00:11:53,380
Goodbye.

306
00:12:01,521 --> 00:12:02,389
[music playing]

307
00:12:02,489 --> 00:12:04,524
(SINGING) I'm a hero.

308
00:12:04,624 --> 00:12:06,593
I'm feeling warm and snuggly.

309
00:12:06,693 --> 00:12:09,562
Got a girlfriend,
although I'm awful ugly.

310
00:12:09,662 --> 00:12:10,597
I'm a hero.

311
00:12:10,697 --> 00:12:12,265
I'm feeling warm and snuggly.

312
00:12:12,365 --> 00:12:13,300
I'm feel--

313
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:16,136
Hey, what happened
to the happy music?

314
00:12:16,236 --> 00:12:16,937
Oh, well.

315
00:12:19,739 --> 00:12:24,711
OK, Toxic Crusader, get ready
to become the crushed crusader.

316
00:12:30,984 --> 00:12:31,885
Uh oh.

317
00:12:31,985 --> 00:12:34,687
I got that old feeling.

318
00:12:34,788 --> 00:12:35,488
Oh, no.

319
00:12:35,588 --> 00:12:38,058
Look out, little girl.

320
00:12:38,158 --> 00:12:41,328
Look out!

321
00:12:41,428 --> 00:12:43,063
Are you OK, Toxie?

322
00:12:43,163 --> 00:12:45,232
Actually, I'm feeling
a little rundown.

323
00:12:45,332 --> 00:12:46,900
He's moving in for the kill.

324
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,503
This is the end of
the Toxic Crusader.

325
00:12:50,603 --> 00:12:52,405
I don't know, Dr. Killemoff.

326
00:12:52,505 --> 00:12:54,307
What if old Toxie
jumps out of the way

327
00:12:54,407 --> 00:12:56,743
and defeats Bonehead with
his super powered mop?

328
00:12:56,844 --> 00:12:58,979
Don't be ridiculous!

329
00:12:59,079 --> 00:12:59,913
Are you ready, Mop?

330
00:13:08,021 --> 00:13:08,721
Whoa!

331
00:13:12,759 --> 00:13:13,626
[scream]

332
00:13:14,727 --> 00:13:16,129
Oh, no!

333
00:13:16,229 --> 00:13:18,398
Bonehead has been
defeated by the Toxic

334
00:13:18,498 --> 00:13:20,868
Crusader's cursed mop.

335
00:13:20,968 --> 00:13:22,502
I told you so.

336
00:13:22,602 --> 00:13:23,871
What did you say?

337
00:13:23,971 --> 00:13:25,205
Nothing.

338
00:13:25,305 --> 00:13:29,376
I will have to put an end to
this Toxic Crusader myself.

339
00:13:29,476 --> 00:13:32,412
Psycho, prepare my
Radiation Rangers for battle

340
00:13:32,512 --> 00:13:37,150
while I prepare a special
weapon just in case.

341
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:38,418
He still might beat
us if he's helped

342
00:13:38,518 --> 00:13:40,187
by other hideously
deformed creatures

343
00:13:40,287 --> 00:13:42,055
with superhuman
size and strength.

344
00:13:42,155 --> 00:13:43,090
Psycho!

345
00:13:43,190 --> 00:13:46,393
I grow weary of your
ridiculous ideas.

346
00:13:46,493 --> 00:13:47,194
Sorry.

347
00:13:47,294 --> 00:13:48,161
Bad guys are so stupid.

348
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:55,668
Yvonne, it's me, Toxie.

349
00:13:55,768 --> 00:13:58,171
Oh, Toxie, I missed you so!

350
00:13:58,271 --> 00:13:59,772
Whoa!
[grunt]

351
00:13:59,873 --> 00:14:00,740
Honey, where are you?

352
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:02,409
I'm right here, Yvonne.

353
00:14:02,509 --> 00:14:03,376
Oh, goody.

354
00:14:03,476 --> 00:14:04,711
I have a surprise for you.

355
00:14:04,811 --> 00:14:07,347
I got new glasses so I can
finally see your gorgeous face.

356
00:14:07,447 --> 00:14:08,148
[gasp]

357
00:14:08,248 --> 00:14:10,583
Yvonne, no!

358
00:14:10,683 --> 00:14:12,019
[scream]

359
00:14:13,186 --> 00:14:14,922
Aw, I should have
known this would happen.

360
00:14:15,022 --> 00:14:18,191
How could a beautiful,
intelligent girl like Yvonne

361
00:14:18,291 --> 00:14:20,027
ever fall for a
hideously deformed

362
00:14:20,127 --> 00:14:21,761
creature such as myself?

363
00:14:21,861 --> 00:14:22,996
But I did fall for you, Toxie.

364
00:14:23,096 --> 00:14:24,197
Huh?

365
00:14:24,297 --> 00:14:26,967
But the minute you saw how
ugly I am, you screamed.

366
00:14:27,067 --> 00:14:27,767
You're not ugly.

367
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:29,402
You're very handsome.

368
00:14:29,502 --> 00:14:31,238
It's your tie that
made me scream.

369
00:14:31,338 --> 00:14:32,705
Now that's ugly.

370
00:14:32,805 --> 00:14:33,673
I mean, more than ugly.

371
00:14:33,773 --> 00:14:34,474
It's gross.

372
00:14:34,574 --> 00:14:35,275
OK.

373
00:14:35,375 --> 00:14:36,743
So she's just beautiful.

374
00:14:36,843 --> 00:14:38,245
[helicopter approaching]

375
00:14:51,358 --> 00:14:53,426
Uh, Toxie, honey, I don't
think I can go out tonight.

376
00:14:53,526 --> 00:14:54,461
I really have to wash my hair.

377
00:14:57,297 --> 00:14:58,398
Can I help you?

378
00:14:58,498 --> 00:15:01,434
Say your prayers,
Toxic Crusader.

379
00:15:01,534 --> 00:15:02,235
Why?

380
00:15:02,335 --> 00:15:03,503
Am I going to bed now?

381
00:15:03,603 --> 00:15:04,771
No.

382
00:15:04,871 --> 00:15:08,141
You are going to die for
standing in the way of my plans

383
00:15:08,241 --> 00:15:09,709
to pollute Tromaville.

384
00:15:09,809 --> 00:15:11,945
But why do you want
to pollute Tromaville?

385
00:15:12,045 --> 00:15:14,847
What good does it do anybody
to poison the environment?

386
00:15:14,948 --> 00:15:17,117
I've always
wondered that myself.

387
00:15:17,217 --> 00:15:20,553
It may be poison to humans
but not to the people

388
00:15:20,653 --> 00:15:22,322
of my planet-- Smogula.

389
00:15:25,392 --> 00:15:26,426
Oh, man.

390
00:15:26,526 --> 00:15:28,861
I'm working for a cockroach?

391
00:15:28,962 --> 00:15:31,731
For the Smogulans to
take over this planet,

392
00:15:31,831 --> 00:15:35,935
the air and water must be
first poisoned to our liking.

393
00:15:36,036 --> 00:15:38,538
But if you poison our
planet-- as if we can't do it

394
00:15:38,638 --> 00:15:42,042
ourselves-- then all human
and animal life will die.

395
00:15:42,142 --> 00:15:43,510
What's your point?

396
00:15:43,610 --> 00:15:44,777
Whoa.

397
00:15:44,877 --> 00:15:48,315
I am definitely in the
presence of some big time evil.

398
00:15:48,415 --> 00:15:50,650
My point is this, bughead!

399
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:52,819
This is my planet.

400
00:15:52,919 --> 00:15:54,221
Even though I don't
look like I'm from it.

401
00:15:54,321 --> 00:15:56,423
And this is my town,
which means it's

402
00:15:56,523 --> 00:15:58,758
my job to keep it
safe, beautiful,

403
00:15:58,858 --> 00:16:01,094
and free from pollution.

404
00:16:01,194 --> 00:16:05,465
Then prepare todie, Toxic Crusader.

405
00:16:05,565 --> 00:16:07,300
Apocalypse now!

406
00:16:11,371 --> 00:16:12,572
I sure could use some help.

407
00:16:18,611 --> 00:16:21,181
Excuse me, but me and my friend
are looking for a hideously

408
00:16:21,281 --> 00:16:23,216
deformed creature named Toxie.

409
00:16:23,316 --> 00:16:24,017
Have you seen him?

410
00:16:24,117 --> 00:16:25,885
He's up there.

411
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:26,686
Oh, yeah.

412
00:16:26,786 --> 00:16:28,255
That's him.

413
00:16:28,355 --> 00:16:30,623
Achoo!

414
00:16:30,723 --> 00:16:31,424
Gesundheit.

415
00:16:31,524 --> 00:16:32,792
Thank you.

416
00:16:32,892 --> 00:16:34,161
[grunt]
[groan]

417
00:16:34,261 --> 00:16:35,062
[crash]

418
00:16:35,162 --> 00:16:36,896
You fools, get him!

419
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:39,299
I hate this part.

420
00:16:39,399 --> 00:16:41,434
It's cleanup time!

421
00:16:41,534 --> 00:16:43,203
Oh, sorry.

422
00:16:43,303 --> 00:16:44,504
[grunts]

423
00:16:44,604 --> 00:16:45,338
Excuse me.

424
00:16:45,438 --> 00:16:46,406
My name's No-Zone.

425
00:16:46,506 --> 00:16:48,475
This is my friend,
Major Disaster.

426
00:16:48,575 --> 00:16:52,179
We're both hideously deformed
creatures with superhuman size

427
00:16:52,279 --> 00:16:53,346
and strength.

428
00:16:53,446 --> 00:16:54,147
Really?

429
00:16:54,247 --> 00:16:54,981
Me, too.

430
00:16:55,082 --> 00:16:56,083
Yeah, we know.

431
00:16:56,183 --> 00:16:58,818
We saw you on TV and
wanted to come join you.

432
00:16:58,918 --> 00:17:00,687
Well, I have to warn you.

433
00:17:00,787 --> 00:17:02,089
It's a tough job.

434
00:17:02,189 --> 00:17:03,790
There's no dental plan.

435
00:17:03,890 --> 00:17:05,625
And we don't get any piece
of the merchandising.

436
00:17:05,725 --> 00:17:07,026
Ah, that's OK.

437
00:17:07,127 --> 00:17:08,795
We just want to fight bad guys.

438
00:17:08,895 --> 00:17:09,596
Great.

439
00:17:09,696 --> 00:17:11,198
You're hired.

440
00:17:11,298 --> 00:17:12,899
What's Major Disaster doing?

441
00:17:12,999 --> 00:17:15,102
Oh, he has a power
to control plants.

442
00:17:15,202 --> 00:17:17,504
It takes him a few seconds
to get going, though.

443
00:17:21,441 --> 00:17:22,609
Hey!
What's going on?

444
00:17:22,709 --> 00:17:23,543
-Let go.
-Psycho!

445
00:17:23,643 --> 00:17:24,344
Let go!

446
00:17:24,444 --> 00:17:25,878
Hey!

447
00:17:25,978 --> 00:17:29,382
Hey, that's a cool superpower.

448
00:17:29,482 --> 00:17:30,383
Release Polluto.

449
00:17:36,423 --> 00:17:39,058
Destroy the Toxic
Crusader and his friends.

450
00:17:43,062 --> 00:17:43,963
Uh, look.

451
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:46,099
It's some kind of
living oil slick.

452
00:17:46,199 --> 00:17:49,769
Mop, come back!

453
00:17:49,869 --> 00:17:51,304
Mop hates a mess.

454
00:17:51,404 --> 00:17:52,139
Oh, no!

455
00:17:52,239 --> 00:17:54,241
That thing ate my mop.

456
00:17:54,341 --> 00:17:56,276
Well, what do we do now?

457
00:17:56,376 --> 00:17:57,277
I've got an idea.

458
00:17:57,377 --> 00:17:58,077
Follow me.

459
00:18:01,214 --> 00:18:02,115
Kitty litter?

460
00:18:02,215 --> 00:18:04,251
What are we doing
with kitty litter?

461
00:18:04,351 --> 00:18:06,786
Toxie, we're not
fighting Heathcliff.

462
00:18:06,886 --> 00:18:07,887
Trust me.

463
00:18:07,987 --> 00:18:09,989
Just empty the kitty
litter onto the ground.

464
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:12,659
Now No-Zone, aim your
schnozzle at that thing

465
00:18:12,759 --> 00:18:14,494
and use your sneeze power.

466
00:18:14,594 --> 00:18:16,129
You got it, buddy.

467
00:18:16,229 --> 00:18:20,533
Ah-- ah-- ah-- ahchoo!

468
00:18:25,004 --> 00:18:27,307
The kitty litter is
drying up the oil slick.

469
00:18:33,246 --> 00:18:34,447
Oh, Mop!

470
00:18:34,547 --> 00:18:35,348
Are you OK?

471
00:18:35,448 --> 00:18:36,416
[squeak]

472
00:18:36,516 --> 00:18:38,785
DR. KILLEMOFF: This
can't be happening!

473
00:18:38,885 --> 00:18:40,553
If it weren't for
those other two

474
00:18:40,653 --> 00:18:43,723
hideously deformed creatures
helping the Toxic Crusader,

475
00:18:43,823 --> 00:18:46,326
I would have defeated him!

476
00:18:46,426 --> 00:18:48,461
I told you so.

477
00:18:48,561 --> 00:18:49,862
[scream]

478
00:18:52,299 --> 00:18:53,600
[crash]

479
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:54,534
Oh, Toxie!

480
00:18:54,634 --> 00:18:55,735
I'm so proud of you!

481
00:18:55,835 --> 00:18:57,136
You saved Tromaville.

482
00:18:57,237 --> 00:18:58,871
Of course he saved Tromaville.

483
00:18:58,971 --> 00:18:59,672
He's my son.

484
00:18:59,772 --> 00:19:01,441
He's a hero.

485
00:19:01,541 --> 00:19:02,742
I'm no hero, Mom.

486
00:19:02,842 --> 00:19:05,678
I'm just doing my part to
keep Tromaville beautiful,

487
00:19:05,778 --> 00:19:07,580
safe, and free from pollution.

488
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:10,016
Gee, what an
amazing coincidence.

489
00:19:10,116 --> 00:19:12,151
All three of us were
turned into hideously

490
00:19:12,252 --> 00:19:14,787
deformed creatures with
superhuman size and strength

491
00:19:14,887 --> 00:19:15,922
by accident.

492
00:19:16,022 --> 00:19:16,856
That's right.

493
00:19:16,956 --> 00:19:18,758
I was a soldierin the Army when I

494
00:19:18,858 --> 00:19:20,527
fell into a radioactive swamp.

495
00:19:20,627 --> 00:19:23,530
NO-ZONE: And I was a pilot
when I flew through a hole

496
00:19:23,630 --> 00:19:25,532
in the ozone and crashed
my plane into a silo

497
00:19:25,632 --> 00:19:27,467
of radioactive pepper.

498
00:19:27,567 --> 00:19:28,268
[sneeze]

499
00:19:28,368 --> 00:19:29,135
TOXIE: Gesundheit.

500
00:19:29,236 --> 00:19:31,003
NO-ZONE: Thank you.

501
00:19:31,103 --> 00:19:32,705
I've got it.

502
00:19:32,805 --> 00:19:33,840
The answer to our problems.

503
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:36,276
I found jobs for all of us.

504
00:19:36,376 --> 00:19:37,510
Jobs?

505
00:19:37,610 --> 00:19:39,279
Why do we need jobs, anyway?

506
00:19:39,379 --> 00:19:41,548
We're the Toxic Crusaders!

507
00:19:41,648 --> 00:19:44,751
Yes, but superheroing isn't
a very high paying profession.

508
00:19:44,851 --> 00:19:46,419
And the landlord wants his rent.

509
00:19:46,519 --> 00:19:48,821
And the medical benefits stink.

510
00:19:48,921 --> 00:19:50,857
Uh, anything for a hideously
deformed creature with

511
00:19:50,957 --> 00:19:52,659
superhuman size and strength?

512
00:19:52,759 --> 00:19:53,793
Sort of.

513
00:19:53,893 --> 00:19:56,496
This ad calls for someone
who loves children

514
00:19:56,596 --> 00:19:58,465
and doesn't mind getting messy.

515
00:19:58,565 --> 00:19:59,732
Close enough.

516
00:19:59,832 --> 00:20:03,069
Yvonne, this job calls for
a person with a warm heart

517
00:20:03,169 --> 00:20:05,638
and superior musical skills.

518
00:20:05,738 --> 00:20:06,506
[laughter]

519
00:20:06,606 --> 00:20:07,707
Perfect.

520
00:20:07,807 --> 00:20:11,778
"Looking for someone who
really wants to clean up."

521
00:20:11,878 --> 00:20:13,045
Forget it, Mop.

522
00:20:13,145 --> 00:20:16,316
This one is mine.

523
00:20:16,416 --> 00:20:18,518
Oh, here's one for me.

524
00:20:18,618 --> 00:20:19,486
"Earn big pay.

525
00:20:19,586 --> 00:20:21,521
No heavy lifting."

526
00:20:21,621 --> 00:20:24,123
What about me?

527
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:26,293
Well, how about this?
"Looking for someone who is

528
00:20:26,393 --> 00:20:28,395
outgoing and has a large nose."

529
00:20:28,495 --> 00:20:30,930
It's a stretch,
but I'll try it.

530
00:20:39,972 --> 00:20:41,341
[inaudible].

531
00:20:41,441 --> 00:20:43,743
I don't like this, Killemoff.

532
00:20:43,843 --> 00:20:46,946
That's Dr. Killemoff to you.

533
00:20:47,046 --> 00:20:49,181
Uh, yeah, sure.

534
00:20:49,282 --> 00:20:51,851
I'm sorry, uh, Dr. Killemoff.

535
00:20:51,951 --> 00:20:53,720
It won't happen again.

536
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:57,790
Anyway, like I was saying,
I don't like it, Killem--

537
00:20:57,890 --> 00:21:00,059
I-- I mean, Dr. Killemoff.

538
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:02,061
You're talking about
messing with the food

539
00:21:02,161 --> 00:21:04,431
that little kids love to eat.

540
00:21:04,531 --> 00:21:06,366
I'll give you half
of the profits.

541
00:21:06,466 --> 00:21:07,166
Deal.

542
00:21:07,266 --> 00:21:09,235
I hate kids, anyway.

543
00:21:09,336 --> 00:21:10,970
This is perfect!

544
00:21:11,070 --> 00:21:14,541
Everyone in Tromaville
eats at Burpo Burger.

545
00:21:14,641 --> 00:21:16,943
Yeah, they got great fries.

546
00:21:17,043 --> 00:21:18,110
Exactly.

547
00:21:18,210 --> 00:21:21,581
And once I adjust those
fries to my evil purpose,

548
00:21:21,681 --> 00:21:24,317
I'll control the
people of Tromaville.

549
00:21:24,417 --> 00:21:27,954
Then no one can stop me from
polluting this disgustingly

550
00:21:28,054 --> 00:21:29,722
clean little town.

551
00:21:29,822 --> 00:21:34,694
And once I pollute Tromaville,
the rest of the world is mine!

552
00:21:34,794 --> 00:21:36,763
What happens if one
of the Toxic Crusaders

553
00:21:36,863 --> 00:21:40,266
gets a job at Burpo Burger
and foils your plan?

554
00:21:40,367 --> 00:21:42,101
Impossible!

555
00:21:42,201 --> 00:21:46,305
Imagine a Toxic Crusader
working at Burpo Burger.

556
00:21:46,406 --> 00:21:47,840
Ridiculous.

557
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:50,377
My plan is flawless!

558
00:21:50,477 --> 00:21:51,611
[laughter]

559
00:21:51,711 --> 00:21:52,812
Yeah.

560
00:21:52,912 --> 00:21:56,115
Even now, evil Dr. Bender
is working on the most

561
00:21:56,215 --> 00:21:58,117
dastardly part of my plan.

562
00:21:58,217 --> 00:21:59,552
[laughter]

563
00:22:05,392 --> 00:22:06,993
Here, my friend.

564
00:22:07,093 --> 00:22:08,761
One taste of this,
and you'll turn

565
00:22:08,861 --> 00:22:13,165
into a forgetful,
nearsighted old rat.

566
00:22:13,265 --> 00:22:14,967
(SINGING) Oh, oh.

567
00:22:15,067 --> 00:22:18,137
Oh, yeah.

568
00:22:18,237 --> 00:22:19,005
No!

569
00:22:19,105 --> 00:22:20,206
No!

570
00:22:20,306 --> 00:22:23,376
This is the 81st batch,
and it still isn't right.

571
00:22:23,476 --> 00:22:25,144
I need to test this right away.

572
00:22:25,244 --> 00:22:27,046
I need a human guinea pig.

573
00:22:27,146 --> 00:22:27,847
I need--

574
00:22:27,947 --> 00:22:28,748
[knocking]

575
00:22:28,848 --> 00:22:29,849
Aha.

576
00:22:29,949 --> 00:22:31,150
Hey, Stretch.

577
00:22:31,250 --> 00:22:33,553
This where the evil
genius Dr. Bender hangs?

578
00:22:33,653 --> 00:22:34,353
Yes.

579
00:22:34,454 --> 00:22:35,221
Yes.

580
00:22:35,321 --> 00:22:37,123
I'm the evil genius Dr. Bender.

581
00:22:37,223 --> 00:22:38,124
Cool.

582
00:22:38,224 --> 00:22:40,593
I got a telegram
from a Dr. Killemoff.

583
00:22:40,693 --> 00:22:41,394
How touching.

584
00:22:41,494 --> 00:22:42,695
He remembered my birthday.

585
00:22:42,795 --> 00:22:45,131
And that's more than I can
say for my evil genius mother.

586
00:22:45,231 --> 00:22:47,199
Here's a little
message just for you.

587
00:22:47,299 --> 00:22:48,100
Don't dilly-dally.

588
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:49,335
I need the goo.

589
00:22:49,436 --> 00:22:51,170
If you fail, you'll die today.

590
00:22:51,270 --> 00:22:53,973
Sincerely yours, Dr. K.

591
00:22:54,073 --> 00:22:56,042
What kind of a birthday
greeting is that?

592
00:22:56,142 --> 00:22:57,444
Hey, I don't write em.

593
00:22:57,544 --> 00:22:58,711
I just sing em.

594
00:22:58,811 --> 00:22:59,779
Ah, no matter.

595
00:22:59,879 --> 00:23:01,080
Have some soup.

596
00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:02,348
No, thanks, Doc.

597
00:23:02,449 --> 00:23:03,683
I'm a vegetarian.

598
00:23:03,783 --> 00:23:07,386
Why don't you just give me a
tip, and we'll call it even?

599
00:23:07,487 --> 00:23:08,187
[scream]

600
00:23:08,287 --> 00:23:09,188
Look out!

601
00:23:09,288 --> 00:23:11,157
Oh, I hate this job, man.

602
00:23:11,257 --> 00:23:12,158
DR. BENDER: Look out!

603
00:23:12,258 --> 00:23:14,126
The atom smasher.

604
00:23:14,226 --> 00:23:15,127
[crash]

605
00:23:15,227 --> 00:23:18,097
Ooh, [inaudible].

606
00:23:18,197 --> 00:23:20,600
And turn off that
infernal radio!

607
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:22,569
FENDER: Hey, it's your telegram.

608
00:23:26,673 --> 00:23:28,140
[scream]

609
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:29,041
[scream]

610
00:23:31,143 --> 00:23:32,479
Where are we going, Doc?

611
00:23:32,579 --> 00:23:33,580
Egads.

612
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:35,715
The atom smasher made
us into one person.

613
00:23:35,815 --> 00:23:37,917
So unsmash, man.

614
00:23:38,017 --> 00:23:38,785
I don't know how.

615
00:23:38,885 --> 00:23:39,986
Bummer.

616
00:23:40,086 --> 00:23:42,021
It's going to be a little
tough picking up chicks.

617
00:23:42,121 --> 00:23:45,792
Say, do you like sushi, Doc?

618
00:23:45,892 --> 00:23:46,859
I can't wait.

619
00:23:46,959 --> 00:23:49,195
I'm really going to
clean up in this job.

620
00:23:49,295 --> 00:23:50,630
You sure are.

621
00:23:50,730 --> 00:23:53,165
And you can start by
dusting the window display.

622
00:23:56,235 --> 00:23:59,972
So, lady, should I start here?

623
00:24:00,072 --> 00:24:01,407
Oh, man.

624
00:24:01,508 --> 00:24:02,842
Oh, man.

625
00:24:02,942 --> 00:24:03,643
Oh, yeah.

626
00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:08,581
It worked.

627
00:24:08,681 --> 00:24:11,217
It's become a forgetful,
nearsighted old rat.

628
00:24:11,317 --> 00:24:15,588
Like I always say, the
82nd time's the charm.

629
00:24:15,688 --> 00:24:17,356
Oh, what is that goo?

630
00:24:17,456 --> 00:24:18,758
This isn't just any goo.

631
00:24:18,858 --> 00:24:19,826
This is-- ahh!

632
00:24:19,926 --> 00:24:20,760
My arm!

633
00:24:20,860 --> 00:24:22,128
What's wrong with my arm?

634
00:24:22,228 --> 00:24:22,929
It doesn't work.

635
00:24:23,029 --> 00:24:23,963
Sure, it does.

636
00:24:24,063 --> 00:24:24,797
Hi, Doc.

637
00:24:24,897 --> 00:24:25,898
Hi!

638
00:24:25,998 --> 00:24:28,635
Now as I was saying,
this isn't just any goo.

639
00:24:28,735 --> 00:24:30,837
Anyone who eats it will
turn into a forgetful,

640
00:24:30,937 --> 00:24:32,505
nearsighted old person.

641
00:24:32,605 --> 00:24:33,906
Pull off that paper.

642
00:24:34,006 --> 00:24:36,008
I call it Magoop 82.

643
00:24:36,108 --> 00:24:36,809
Gross.

644
00:24:36,909 --> 00:24:38,044
Why'd you make it?

645
00:24:38,144 --> 00:24:41,147
Because it's exactly what
Dr. Killemoff ordered.

646
00:24:41,247 --> 00:24:42,815
[laughter]

647
00:24:43,983 --> 00:24:48,054
YVONNE: (SINGING)
Oh, give to the poor.

648
00:24:48,154 --> 00:24:50,322
Give cause it's right.

649
00:24:50,422 --> 00:24:51,090
Oh.

650
00:24:52,191 --> 00:24:53,025
Come on, guys.

651
00:24:53,125 --> 00:24:53,826
Pick it up.

652
00:24:53,926 --> 00:24:55,294
Tempo, tempo, tempo.

653
00:24:55,394 --> 00:24:56,629
[growl]
-All right.

654
00:24:56,729 --> 00:24:57,429
All right.

655
00:24:57,530 --> 00:24:59,766
Jeez.

656
00:24:59,866 --> 00:25:01,400
Thank you, kind sir.

657
00:25:05,204 --> 00:25:06,038
Thanks, Toxie.

658
00:25:06,138 --> 00:25:07,439
I always hated this shirt.

659
00:25:07,540 --> 00:25:09,709
Now I won't have
to wear it anymore.

660
00:25:09,809 --> 00:25:11,678
Glad I could help.

661
00:25:11,778 --> 00:25:13,680
Toxie, your tromatons
are acting up.

662
00:25:13,780 --> 00:25:14,981
Oh, they sure are.

663
00:25:15,081 --> 00:25:17,116
I better find out why fast.

664
00:25:20,152 --> 00:25:21,520
Whoa!

665
00:25:21,621 --> 00:25:25,024
DR. KILLEMOFF: It's
working perfectly.

666
00:25:25,124 --> 00:25:27,660
In just a few moments,
my Radiation Rangers

667
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:32,298
will have spread the Magoop 82
over the whole potato patch,

668
00:25:32,398 --> 00:25:35,167
setting my plan into full swing.

669
00:25:35,267 --> 00:25:36,468
I don't know.

670
00:25:36,569 --> 00:25:39,205
What if the Toxic Crusader's
tromatons start acting up

671
00:25:39,305 --> 00:25:41,841
and he shows up and beats
all our guys to a pulp?

672
00:25:41,941 --> 00:25:43,776
Don't be a fool!

673
00:25:43,876 --> 00:25:45,177
Bonehead is in charge.

674
00:25:45,277 --> 00:25:48,581
And I know I'm going
to be proud of him.

675
00:25:48,681 --> 00:25:50,549
Dr. Killemoff's going
to be proud of me.

676
00:25:50,650 --> 00:25:51,751
And maybe I'll get a promotion.

677
00:25:51,851 --> 00:25:53,586
Maybe I'll get a raise.

678
00:25:53,686 --> 00:25:55,655
Maybe he'll stop
slapping me around.

679
00:25:55,755 --> 00:25:58,190
TOXIE: It's Killemoff's
Radiation Rangers.

680
00:25:58,290 --> 00:26:01,861
They're polluting the potato
patch with toxic chemicals.

681
00:26:01,961 --> 00:26:02,895
That's un-American.

682
00:26:02,995 --> 00:26:05,364
YVONNE: You've got
to stop him, Toxie.

683
00:26:05,464 --> 00:26:06,165
Right.

684
00:26:06,265 --> 00:26:08,034
You know what you need?

685
00:26:08,134 --> 00:26:08,901
A good luck kiss.

686
00:26:09,001 --> 00:26:09,702
Uh-uh.

687
00:26:09,802 --> 00:26:10,970
A battle cry.

688
00:26:11,070 --> 00:26:11,771
I do?

689
00:26:11,871 --> 00:26:13,005
Uh-huh.

690
00:26:13,105 --> 00:26:14,440
Something to yell before
you do battle that'll strike

691
00:26:14,540 --> 00:26:15,808
fear in the hearts
of your enemies.

692
00:26:15,908 --> 00:26:19,812
Something like it's clobbering
time or hi-ho silver!

693
00:26:19,912 --> 00:26:21,313
Hm.

694
00:26:21,413 --> 00:26:22,114
Wait.

695
00:26:22,214 --> 00:26:24,917
I got it.

696
00:26:25,017 --> 00:26:27,186
(LOUDLY) I hope
I don't get hurt!

697
00:26:29,789 --> 00:26:31,557
We'll work on it.

698
00:26:31,658 --> 00:26:32,524
Look out!

699
00:26:32,625 --> 00:26:34,560
It's the Toxic Crusader!

700
00:26:34,661 --> 00:26:37,363
Stop him!

701
00:26:37,463 --> 00:26:38,297
[scream]

702
00:26:38,998 --> 00:26:39,932
Yeah!

703
00:26:40,032 --> 00:26:41,768
Now finish off the
toxic troublemaker.

704
00:26:45,672 --> 00:26:46,438
Oh, man.

705
00:26:46,538 --> 00:26:47,239
Now what?

706
00:26:50,476 --> 00:26:51,343
[groan]

707
00:26:51,443 --> 00:26:52,745
Mashed potatoes.

708
00:26:52,845 --> 00:26:56,215
You gotta do better
than that to beat me.

709
00:26:56,315 --> 00:26:57,016
What the?

710
00:26:59,551 --> 00:27:00,252
Hey!

711
00:27:00,352 --> 00:27:01,487
What happened?

712
00:27:01,587 --> 00:27:02,822
Yeah, what happened?

713
00:27:02,922 --> 00:27:05,524
The mashed potatoes-- they
must have clogged up the intake

714
00:27:05,624 --> 00:27:07,259
vent on his life support system.

715
00:27:07,359 --> 00:27:08,728
He's overheating.

716
00:27:08,828 --> 00:27:10,196
Oh, yeah!

717
00:27:14,701 --> 00:27:15,802
Shoot, you cowards!

718
00:27:18,705 --> 00:27:20,472
[inaudible].

719
00:27:20,572 --> 00:27:21,507
Back in the truck.

720
00:27:21,607 --> 00:27:22,308
Quick!

721
00:27:22,408 --> 00:27:23,142
Hey!

722
00:27:23,242 --> 00:27:24,376
You think you won, don't you?

723
00:27:24,476 --> 00:27:27,379
Well, go have some
Burpo fries on me!

724
00:27:27,479 --> 00:27:28,848
[laughter]

725
00:27:30,416 --> 00:27:32,418
Toxie, you beat em!

726
00:27:32,518 --> 00:27:33,720
No, I mashed em.

727
00:27:33,820 --> 00:27:34,553
Whatever.

728
00:27:34,653 --> 00:27:36,388
I wonder what they were up to.

729
00:27:41,327 --> 00:27:43,295
Why do they call them
Burpo Burgers, Dad?

730
00:27:43,395 --> 00:27:44,697
Eh, don't ask.

731
00:27:44,797 --> 00:27:45,998
Hi, kids.

732
00:27:46,098 --> 00:27:47,633
It's me, Burpo Magician.

733
00:27:47,734 --> 00:27:50,937
And we're going to have fun.

734
00:27:51,037 --> 00:27:52,604
(SINGING) Burpo is my name.

735
00:27:52,705 --> 00:27:54,040
And [inaudible] are my game.

736
00:27:54,140 --> 00:27:58,077
And if you think I really stink,
I'll say you stink the same.

737
00:27:58,177 --> 00:27:58,878
Ta-da!

738
00:28:01,547 --> 00:28:02,248
Oh, boy.

739
00:28:02,348 --> 00:28:04,717
Tough crowd.

740
00:28:04,817 --> 00:28:05,684
Hi, kids!

741
00:28:05,785 --> 00:28:08,888
How about some balloon animals?

742
00:28:08,988 --> 00:28:09,789
Ta-da!

743
00:28:09,889 --> 00:28:11,958
It looks like a foot.

744
00:28:12,058 --> 00:28:14,060
Well, uh, it is a foot.

745
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:16,562
You know how hard it is
to sculpt body parts?

746
00:28:16,662 --> 00:28:18,164
I wonder when I
get a coffee break.

747
00:28:23,702 --> 00:28:24,937
OK.

748
00:28:25,037 --> 00:28:27,506
This is the first batch of
Burpo fries made from potatoes

749
00:28:27,606 --> 00:28:28,808
treated with Magoop 82.

750
00:28:28,908 --> 00:28:29,608
Cool.

751
00:28:29,708 --> 00:28:31,010
Burpo fries are the best.

752
00:28:31,110 --> 00:28:31,811
No.

753
00:28:31,911 --> 00:28:33,212
Don't eat those, fool.

754
00:28:33,312 --> 00:28:35,882
Or we'll turn into forgetful,
nearsighted old men.

755
00:28:35,982 --> 00:28:36,816
Yuck!

756
00:28:36,916 --> 00:28:39,285
I thought they
just made you fat.

757
00:28:39,385 --> 00:28:40,519
Enough talk!

758
00:28:40,619 --> 00:28:41,788
I want results.

759
00:28:41,888 --> 00:28:44,423
Show me that it works.

760
00:28:44,523 --> 00:28:45,825
Chill, Chief.

761
00:28:45,925 --> 00:28:48,394
We told the staff here not to
eat any of the new Burpo fries

762
00:28:48,494 --> 00:28:50,329
because they're extra special.

763
00:28:50,429 --> 00:28:51,663
So what?

764
00:28:51,764 --> 00:28:54,133
So of course they
ate them right away.

765
00:28:54,233 --> 00:28:55,567
Say, watch where you're going.

766
00:28:55,667 --> 00:28:57,469
Hey, what's going on here?

767
00:28:57,569 --> 00:28:58,437
[chatter]

768
00:29:00,439 --> 00:29:02,241
Excellent.

769
00:29:02,341 --> 00:29:04,110
Uh, excuse me, chubby.

770
00:29:04,210 --> 00:29:06,545
You know where the restroom is?

771
00:29:06,645 --> 00:29:07,746
[groan]

772
00:29:07,847 --> 00:29:10,416
Find it yourself, old man.

773
00:29:10,516 --> 00:29:12,184
Uh, find what?

774
00:29:12,284 --> 00:29:15,822
Uh, the rest of the Burpo frie
swill be ready this afternoon.

775
00:29:15,922 --> 00:29:17,256
Perfect.

776
00:29:17,356 --> 00:29:20,659
Soon all of Tromaville
will be full of forgetful,

777
00:29:20,759 --> 00:29:22,361
nearsighted old people.

778
00:29:22,461 --> 00:29:26,265
And nothing will stop me from
making this town my pollution

779
00:29:26,365 --> 00:29:29,468
headquarters-- suburban branch.

780
00:29:29,568 --> 00:29:32,671
Like I said before, what if
one of the Toxic Crusaders

781
00:29:32,771 --> 00:29:34,941
gets a job here and
discovers your plan?

782
00:29:35,041 --> 00:29:35,942
Ridiculous!

783
00:29:36,042 --> 00:29:37,709
What are the odds
of that happening?

784
00:29:37,810 --> 00:29:38,811
NO-ZONE: They love me.

785
00:29:38,911 --> 00:29:40,179
I'm a hit!

786
00:29:40,279 --> 00:29:41,247
Uh oh.

787
00:29:41,347 --> 00:29:43,215
It looks like the
odds are pretty good.

788
00:29:43,315 --> 00:29:46,853
I don't suppose you guys would
like some balloon animals.

789
00:29:46,953 --> 00:29:48,054
[crash]

790
00:29:48,154 --> 00:29:49,555
TOXIE: Ice cream.

791
00:29:49,655 --> 00:29:50,456
Ice cream.

792
00:29:50,556 --> 00:29:53,993
Get it before it gets away.

793
00:29:54,093 --> 00:29:55,161
How's business, Toxie?

794
00:29:55,261 --> 00:29:56,395
Oh, terrible.

795
00:29:56,495 --> 00:29:58,197
No one likes warm ice cream.

796
00:29:58,297 --> 00:29:59,698
How is your job, Major Disaster?

797
00:29:59,798 --> 00:30:03,335
I got fired just because
I broke a couple of bowls.

798
00:30:03,435 --> 00:30:04,670
I lost my job, too.

799
00:30:04,770 --> 00:30:07,073
They didn't
appreciate good music.

800
00:30:07,173 --> 00:30:08,640
MRS. JUNKO: Yah!

801
00:30:08,740 --> 00:30:10,042
This is great!

802
00:30:10,142 --> 00:30:12,711
I've been going door to door,
and I sold five of these babies

803
00:30:12,811 --> 00:30:13,712
already.

804
00:30:13,812 --> 00:30:16,682
You might say I'm
sweeping the town.

805
00:30:16,782 --> 00:30:18,350
That's great, Mom.

806
00:30:18,450 --> 00:30:19,418
What's your secret?

807
00:30:19,518 --> 00:30:21,153
I just get in the
house, and I tell them

808
00:30:21,253 --> 00:30:24,356
it's so heavy that I might
have a heart attack if they

809
00:30:24,456 --> 00:30:25,958
make me take it out again.

810
00:30:26,058 --> 00:30:27,793
It's the old sympathy game.

811
00:30:27,894 --> 00:30:29,828
I thought the job
said no heavy lifting.

812
00:30:29,929 --> 00:30:31,463
This is nothing.

813
00:30:31,563 --> 00:30:33,799
You should see the deluxe model.

814
00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:34,600
Gotta run.

815
00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:36,302
Lots more to sell.

816
00:30:36,402 --> 00:30:40,739
Let's go see how No-Zone
is doing at Burpo Burger.

817
00:30:40,839 --> 00:30:42,108
[chatter]

818
00:30:42,208 --> 00:30:43,042
What happened?

819
00:30:43,142 --> 00:30:44,911
I don't know where I am.

820
00:30:45,011 --> 00:30:45,878
[chatter]

821
00:30:47,279 --> 00:30:50,282
I always wondered why this
place had such bad service.

822
00:30:50,382 --> 00:30:51,217
Excuse me.

823
00:30:51,317 --> 00:30:53,052
Have you seen our
friend, No-Zone?

824
00:30:53,152 --> 00:30:56,355
Uh, you mean the funny
looking guy with the big nose

825
00:30:56,455 --> 00:30:58,224
who sneezes all the time?

826
00:30:58,324 --> 00:30:59,025
Yeah.

827
00:30:59,125 --> 00:31:00,126
Uh, never saw him.

828
00:31:03,029 --> 00:31:04,330
So where is he?

829
00:31:04,430 --> 00:31:08,167
I could be wrong, but I think
he was taken to the laboratory

830
00:31:08,267 --> 00:31:10,236
of an evil genius scientist.

831
00:31:10,336 --> 00:31:11,503
How do you know that?

832
00:31:11,603 --> 00:31:12,871
Because it says so right here.

833
00:31:12,972 --> 00:31:14,806
"We took your friend
to the laboratory

834
00:31:14,907 --> 00:31:16,642
of the evil genius Dr. Bender.

835
00:31:16,742 --> 00:31:17,676
Come and get him."

836
00:31:17,776 --> 00:31:24,984
It's signed, "Your
Pal, Dr. Killemoff."

837
00:31:25,084 --> 00:31:26,052
Eat it, magician.

838
00:31:26,152 --> 00:31:26,986
It's good for you.

839
00:31:27,086 --> 00:31:28,020
Hey!

840
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:31,390
If it's that good,
I'll eat it myself.

841
00:31:31,490 --> 00:31:33,492
Are you always this stupid?

842
00:31:33,592 --> 00:31:34,860
I don't know.

843
00:31:34,961 --> 00:31:36,162
Let me think.

844
00:31:36,262 --> 00:31:37,296
Never mind.

845
00:31:37,396 --> 00:31:38,097
Come on.

846
00:31:42,701 --> 00:31:43,869
What are you doing?

847
00:31:43,970 --> 00:31:44,937
Don't worry.

848
00:31:45,037 --> 00:31:46,572
We're just getting
ready for your friends.

849
00:31:46,672 --> 00:31:48,474
They should be here any minute.

850
00:31:48,574 --> 00:31:49,275
Cool.

851
00:31:49,375 --> 00:31:50,309
A party.

852
00:31:50,409 --> 00:31:52,044
I'll make the dip.

853
00:31:52,144 --> 00:31:53,312
You are the dip.

854
00:31:56,983 --> 00:31:57,783
Yay!

855
00:31:57,883 --> 00:31:58,750
The good guys.

856
00:32:01,820 --> 00:32:02,521
Whoa!

857
00:32:05,524 --> 00:32:07,326
Do something!

858
00:32:07,426 --> 00:32:08,194
I'm trying!

859
00:32:08,294 --> 00:32:08,995
I'm trying!

860
00:32:11,263 --> 00:32:11,964
Wow!

861
00:32:12,064 --> 00:32:13,165
What a ride.

862
00:32:13,265 --> 00:32:16,435
You're not a very nice
guy-- or couple of guys--

863
00:32:16,535 --> 00:32:17,669
or whatever you are.

864
00:32:17,769 --> 00:32:20,006
Say, how about some wrinkle
cream, Toxic Crusader?

865
00:32:20,106 --> 00:32:20,906
Throw it!

866
00:32:21,007 --> 00:32:21,707
No!

867
00:32:21,807 --> 00:32:23,642
He's a cool superhero.

868
00:32:23,742 --> 00:32:25,077
Throw it!

869
00:32:25,177 --> 00:32:26,345
Ow!

870
00:32:26,445 --> 00:32:27,146
All right already.

871
00:32:27,246 --> 00:32:31,250
I wish you'd stop doing that.

872
00:32:31,350 --> 00:32:32,518
Holy cow!

873
00:32:37,289 --> 00:32:38,757
Stop, you idiot!

874
00:32:38,857 --> 00:32:39,558
[groan]

875
00:32:40,459 --> 00:32:42,761
I give up.

876
00:32:42,861 --> 00:32:43,662
[buzz]

877
00:32:43,762 --> 00:32:45,297
You did it!

878
00:32:45,397 --> 00:32:46,098
I did?

879
00:32:46,198 --> 00:32:47,166
I'm saved!

880
00:32:47,266 --> 00:32:47,966
[growl]

881
00:32:49,168 --> 00:32:51,170
I'm dead.

882
00:32:51,270 --> 00:32:53,205
Yoo-hoo, Toxic Crusader!

883
00:32:53,305 --> 00:32:54,740
I'm in here!

884
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:57,509
I hope I don't get hurt!

885
00:32:57,609 --> 00:32:58,310
Yvonne's right.

886
00:32:58,410 --> 00:33:00,246
It needs work.

887
00:33:00,346 --> 00:33:01,247
Sneaky, Doc.

888
00:33:01,347 --> 00:33:04,483
Very sneaky.

889
00:33:04,583 --> 00:33:05,784
[laughter]

890
00:33:06,685 --> 00:33:09,388
I'm too young to be old.

891
00:33:09,488 --> 00:33:10,189
Hang on, buddy!

892
00:33:16,928 --> 00:33:19,798
Hurry!

893
00:33:19,898 --> 00:33:21,767
It doesn't look good, Doc.

894
00:33:26,805 --> 00:33:28,807
It's good to be Toxie.

895
00:33:28,907 --> 00:33:30,842
Hey, now that's catchy.

896
00:33:30,942 --> 00:33:32,678
Let's get out of here!

897
00:33:32,778 --> 00:33:33,579
NO-ZONE: Help!

898
00:33:36,448 --> 00:33:37,583
Hold on, No-Zone.

899
00:33:37,683 --> 00:33:38,917
We're coming.

900
00:33:39,017 --> 00:33:39,885
Thanks, Toxie.

901
00:33:39,985 --> 00:33:42,188
It was getting
awful hot in there.

902
00:33:42,288 --> 00:33:43,689
My hero.

903
00:33:43,789 --> 00:33:46,125
What in blazes is
going on here, No-Zone?

904
00:33:46,225 --> 00:33:47,393
It's this goo.

905
00:33:47,493 --> 00:33:50,496
It turns people into forgetful,
nearsighted old folks.

906
00:33:50,596 --> 00:33:52,498
BONEHEAD: Special
on Burpo fries!

907
00:33:52,598 --> 00:33:54,300
Two for one!

908
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:56,635
Get your Burpo fries!

909
00:33:56,735 --> 00:33:57,436
Good.

910
00:33:57,536 --> 00:33:58,637
It's not too late.

911
00:33:58,737 --> 00:34:02,174
NO-ZONE: Yeah, no one's
eating any bad fries yet.

912
00:34:02,274 --> 00:34:03,442
The Toxic Crusaders!

913
00:34:03,542 --> 00:34:04,776
You guys, mind the store.

914
00:34:04,876 --> 00:34:06,978
I've got an evil
plan to carry out.

915
00:34:07,079 --> 00:34:08,447
Attention, everyone.

916
00:34:08,547 --> 00:34:10,582
The evil genius
Dr. Bender has put

917
00:34:10,682 --> 00:34:12,551
a chemical on the Burpo fries.

918
00:34:12,651 --> 00:34:15,020
If you eat them, you'll
turn into forgetful,

919
00:34:15,121 --> 00:34:16,488
nearsighted old folks.

920
00:34:16,588 --> 00:34:17,289
Baloney!

921
00:34:22,294 --> 00:34:23,629
[chatter]

922
00:34:23,729 --> 00:34:24,763
It works.

923
00:34:24,863 --> 00:34:25,564
I'm amazing.

924
00:34:25,664 --> 00:34:27,266
I'm an evil genius.

925
00:34:27,366 --> 00:34:29,067
Evil genius, huh?

926
00:34:29,168 --> 00:34:29,868
Hey.

927
00:34:29,968 --> 00:34:30,836
Hi-ya, Toxie.

928
00:34:30,936 --> 00:34:32,438
Say, what's going
on here, anyway?

929
00:34:32,538 --> 00:34:34,506
Is it senior citizens'
day or something?

930
00:34:34,606 --> 00:34:35,974
Not now, Yvonne.

931
00:34:36,074 --> 00:34:39,010
I'm trying to beatup on a bad guy.

932
00:34:39,111 --> 00:34:42,348
OK, Mr. Evil Genius--
and the other guy.

933
00:34:42,448 --> 00:34:44,550
Prepare to be seriously hurt.

934
00:34:44,650 --> 00:34:45,951
Uh, yeah, yeah.

935
00:34:46,051 --> 00:34:46,852
In a minute.

936
00:34:46,952 --> 00:34:48,654
Who's the rad babe?

937
00:34:48,754 --> 00:34:49,455
Who?

938
00:34:49,555 --> 00:34:50,722
Yvonne?

939
00:34:50,822 --> 00:34:53,625
She's my beautiful, thoughsome
what light girlfriend.

940
00:34:53,725 --> 00:34:55,994
You've got a girlfriend?

941
00:34:56,094 --> 00:34:58,264
I may be a hideously
deformed creature

942
00:34:58,364 --> 00:35:01,667
of superhuman size and
strength, but I am a good guy.

943
00:35:01,767 --> 00:35:03,802
I knew we should
have been a good guy.

944
00:35:03,902 --> 00:35:06,004
The bad guys never
get the chicks.

945
00:35:06,104 --> 00:35:06,805
Say.

946
00:35:06,905 --> 00:35:07,873
Ready for that beating now?

947
00:35:07,973 --> 00:35:08,674
Eh.

948
00:35:08,774 --> 00:35:09,475
Forget that.

949
00:35:09,575 --> 00:35:10,809
We want to be good guys now.

950
00:35:10,909 --> 00:35:11,977
Yeah.

951
00:35:12,077 --> 00:35:14,613
We want to be toxic
crustaceans like you guys.

952
00:35:14,713 --> 00:35:17,716
As long as we get to hang out
with cool babes like Yvonne.

953
00:35:17,816 --> 00:35:21,086
Well, I can't promise anything,
but she does have a sister.

954
00:35:21,187 --> 00:35:21,953
Good enough.

955
00:35:22,053 --> 00:35:23,455
We're good guys now.

956
00:35:23,555 --> 00:35:25,224
Not so fast.

957
00:35:25,324 --> 00:35:27,993
I mean, you're certainly
hideously deformed enough,

958
00:35:28,093 --> 00:35:30,128
but I think you should at
least come up with an antidote

959
00:35:30,229 --> 00:35:32,664
to help all these
poor people before we

960
00:35:32,764 --> 00:35:34,833
let you be a toxic crustacean.

961
00:35:34,933 --> 00:35:35,634
Crusader.

962
00:35:35,734 --> 00:35:36,435
Whatever.

963
00:35:36,535 --> 00:35:37,736
But there is no antidote.

964
00:35:37,836 --> 00:35:39,338
I just love Burpo fries.

965
00:35:39,438 --> 00:35:40,772
Anybody want some?

966
00:35:40,872 --> 00:35:43,575
Yvonne, no!

967
00:35:43,675 --> 00:35:47,045
Hey, there's something
wrong with these fries.

968
00:35:47,145 --> 00:35:48,113
Whoa.

969
00:35:48,214 --> 00:35:51,550
They taste like-- like--

970
00:35:51,650 --> 00:35:53,118
Bubblegum?

971
00:35:53,219 --> 00:35:54,353
I don't get it.

972
00:35:54,453 --> 00:35:56,388
She ate the same fries
as everyone else.

973
00:35:56,488 --> 00:35:57,155
Yeah.

974
00:35:57,256 --> 00:35:58,924
How come she's not old?

975
00:35:59,024 --> 00:36:00,892
I'll tell you a secret.

976
00:36:00,992 --> 00:36:01,793
I don't eat em plain.

977
00:36:01,893 --> 00:36:03,695
I like to put pepper on em.

978
00:36:03,795 --> 00:36:04,630
That's it.

979
00:36:04,730 --> 00:36:05,431
Pepper.

980
00:36:05,531 --> 00:36:06,465
Pepper is the antidote.

981
00:36:06,565 --> 00:36:09,968
It turns the Magoop
82 into bubblegum.

982
00:36:10,068 --> 00:36:11,670
And pretty tasty, at that.

983
00:36:11,770 --> 00:36:12,471
OK.

984
00:36:12,571 --> 00:36:13,705
I found the antidote.

985
00:36:13,805 --> 00:36:16,041
So are we Toxic
Crusaders or what?

986
00:36:16,141 --> 00:36:19,044
Well, actually, Yvonne
found the antidote.

987
00:36:19,144 --> 00:36:20,846
But what the hey?

988
00:36:20,946 --> 00:36:22,914
Rad.

989
00:36:23,014 --> 00:36:24,283
Attention, everyone.

990
00:36:24,383 --> 00:36:27,786
Put pepper on your fries, and
you'll turn back to normal.

991
00:36:27,886 --> 00:36:29,187
[snoring]

992
00:36:30,689 --> 00:36:31,890
We'll help them later.

993
00:36:31,990 --> 00:36:34,360
We've gotta stop Dr.
Killemoff from spraying all

994
00:36:34,460 --> 00:36:36,895
the vegetables with Magoop 82.

995
00:36:36,995 --> 00:36:38,163
Even the broccoli?

996
00:36:38,264 --> 00:36:38,964
Yep.

997
00:36:39,064 --> 00:36:40,766
Even the broccoli.

998
00:36:40,866 --> 00:36:43,068
Ooh, now I am mad.

999
00:36:46,238 --> 00:36:47,639
In a few minutes,
every vegetable

1000
00:36:47,739 --> 00:36:50,576
will be covered with Magoop 82.

1001
00:36:50,676 --> 00:36:53,011
And Tromaville will be mine.

1002
00:36:53,111 --> 00:36:55,981
Unless the Toxic Crusaders
come up with an antidote.

1003
00:36:56,081 --> 00:37:00,218
You know, I'm
really sick of you.

1004
00:37:00,319 --> 00:37:01,019
[gasp]

1005
00:37:01,119 --> 00:37:01,953
We're too late.

1006
00:37:02,053 --> 00:37:03,389
We'll never stop em.

1007
00:37:03,489 --> 00:37:04,756
We're not done yet.

1008
00:37:04,856 --> 00:37:05,857
What's that?

1009
00:37:05,957 --> 00:37:06,692
Pepper.

1010
00:37:06,792 --> 00:37:07,626
Oh, no.

1011
00:37:07,726 --> 00:37:10,161
I hate pep-- pep-- pepper.

1012
00:37:10,262 --> 00:37:11,263
Ready?

1013
00:37:11,363 --> 00:37:12,063
Drop!

1014
00:37:14,533 --> 00:37:16,034
Tromaville is mine!

1015
00:37:16,134 --> 00:37:18,270
Next stop-- the world!

1016
00:37:18,370 --> 00:37:19,671
[laughter]

1017
00:37:19,771 --> 00:37:23,309
TOXIE: Give it all
you've got, buddy.

1018
00:37:23,409 --> 00:37:24,943
Ah-- ah--

1019
00:37:25,043 --> 00:37:25,944
[sneezing]

1020
00:37:30,416 --> 00:37:31,149
Gesundheit.

1021
00:37:31,249 --> 00:37:31,950
What's that?

1022
00:37:32,050 --> 00:37:32,784
What's that?

1023
00:37:32,884 --> 00:37:33,719
It looks like bees.

1024
00:37:33,819 --> 00:37:34,953
PSYCHO: Looks like
antidote to me.

1025
00:37:35,053 --> 00:37:35,887
DR. KILLEMOFF: No!

1026
00:37:35,987 --> 00:37:36,855
No!

1027
00:37:36,955 --> 00:37:37,823
PSYCHO: Yes!

1028
00:37:37,923 --> 00:37:38,624
Yes!

1029
00:37:44,162 --> 00:37:45,997
Phew.

1030
00:37:46,097 --> 00:37:47,299
You did it, No-Zone!

1031
00:37:47,399 --> 00:37:49,368
You saved the vegetables.

1032
00:37:49,468 --> 00:37:50,336
Even the broccoli.

1033
00:37:53,004 --> 00:37:54,340
We did it!

1034
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:55,774
[cheers]

1035
00:37:57,843 --> 00:38:00,746
I hope everyone likes
their vegetables well done.

1036
00:38:04,716 --> 00:38:07,886
I hate those Toxic Crusaders.

1037
00:38:07,986 --> 00:38:10,889
MAJOR DISASTER: Now that
you're a, uh, Toxic Crusader,

1038
00:38:10,989 --> 00:38:11,857
what do we call you?

1039
00:38:11,957 --> 00:38:13,725
Well, I'm Fender.

1040
00:38:13,825 --> 00:38:14,860
I'm Bender.

1041
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:16,895
Gee, that's kind of confusing.

1042
00:38:16,995 --> 00:38:19,631
We need just one
name for both of you.

1043
00:38:19,731 --> 00:38:20,599
-Ow.
-Huh.

1044
00:38:20,699 --> 00:38:21,400
That's it.

1045
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:23,802
We'll call you Headbanger.

1046
00:38:23,902 --> 00:38:24,670
Why?

1047
00:38:24,770 --> 00:38:27,406
At last, the moment is at hand.

1048
00:38:27,506 --> 00:38:30,409
Soon hordes of
pollution-breathing aliens

1049
00:38:30,509 --> 00:38:33,479
from the planet Smogula
will be arriving

1050
00:38:33,579 --> 00:38:35,647
to take over Tromaville.

1051
00:38:35,747 --> 00:38:37,716
I must arrange a
suitable landing

1052
00:38:37,816 --> 00:38:39,150
site for my fellow Smogulans.

1053
00:38:41,853 --> 00:38:44,456
Any suggestions, Mayor Grody?

1054
00:38:44,556 --> 00:38:48,594
Uh, what about the
Tromaville old folks' home.

1055
00:38:48,694 --> 00:38:51,730
It's spacious,
convenient, and you

1056
00:38:51,830 --> 00:38:54,165
can walk to the supermarket.

1057
00:38:54,265 --> 00:38:56,001
Smogulans don't have feet!

1058
00:38:56,101 --> 00:38:58,069
They have little wheels.

1059
00:38:58,169 --> 00:39:00,305
That's even better.

1060
00:39:00,406 --> 00:39:04,676
All the curbs at the home
have wheelchair ramps.

1061
00:39:04,776 --> 00:39:05,811
Yeah, boss.

1062
00:39:05,911 --> 00:39:08,447
And the old geezers will
be a cinch to throw out.

1063
00:39:08,547 --> 00:39:11,417
Uh, Bonehead is right.

1064
00:39:11,517 --> 00:39:16,321
I remember how easy it was to
throw my own dear mother out

1065
00:39:16,422 --> 00:39:17,656
of the house.

1066
00:39:17,756 --> 00:39:21,292
She weighed practically nothing.

1067
00:39:21,393 --> 00:39:22,528
I like it!

1068
00:39:22,628 --> 00:39:25,697
Psycho, fill the spray tanks
with pollution solution.

1069
00:39:25,797 --> 00:39:26,698
Bonehead!

1070
00:39:26,798 --> 00:39:28,366
Take a platoon of
Radiation Rangers

1071
00:39:28,467 --> 00:39:31,770
and toss those old
duffers off the property.

1072
00:39:31,870 --> 00:39:33,071
[laughter]

1073
00:39:33,171 --> 00:39:36,207
And you said there was no
fringe benefits to this job.

1074
00:39:36,307 --> 00:39:37,709
I'm worried, boss.

1075
00:39:37,809 --> 00:39:39,411
Like, what if the
Toxic Crusader's mom

1076
00:39:39,511 --> 00:39:41,847
happens to be friends with
one of those old biddies?

1077
00:39:41,947 --> 00:39:44,550
And she calls on the
Toxic Crusaders to help?

1078
00:39:44,650 --> 00:39:46,718
And he and his fellow
mutant creatures

1079
00:39:46,818 --> 00:39:49,187
kick butt on our
Radiation Rangers?

1080
00:39:49,287 --> 00:39:51,189
What a preposterous idea!

1081
00:39:51,289 --> 00:39:53,158
No wonder they call you Psycho.

1082
00:39:58,063 --> 00:39:59,765
MAYOR GRODY: That's it!

1083
00:39:59,865 --> 00:40:01,533
Keep the line moving.

1084
00:40:01,633 --> 00:40:05,103
We got a dozen more
vans to fill before--

1085
00:40:05,203 --> 00:40:06,605
[burp]

1086
00:40:06,705 --> 00:40:08,339
Lunch break.

1087
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:09,441
Oh, Mayor Grody!

1088
00:40:09,541 --> 00:40:11,309
You can't do this!

1089
00:40:11,409 --> 00:40:14,379
I can do anything I want.

1090
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:16,047
I'm His Honor, the mayor.

1091
00:40:19,885 --> 00:40:22,488
But some of my best
friends are moldy oldies!

1092
00:40:22,588 --> 00:40:23,589
Look, lady.

1093
00:40:23,689 --> 00:40:27,058
This is official city business.

1094
00:40:27,158 --> 00:40:29,094
So butt out.

1095
00:40:29,194 --> 00:40:34,600
Oh, unless, of course, you
are a registered party voter.

1096
00:40:34,700 --> 00:40:35,867
[burp]

1097
00:40:35,967 --> 00:40:40,639
In which case, have a
little leftover jelly donut?

1098
00:40:40,739 --> 00:40:43,775
I'll never be that hungry!

1099
00:40:43,875 --> 00:40:45,577
You'll pay for this.

1100
00:40:45,677 --> 00:40:47,378
Even if I didn't.

1101
00:40:47,479 --> 00:40:51,950
I'm telling my son,
the superhero, on you.

1102
00:40:52,050 --> 00:40:53,552
Radiation Rangers?
Here?

1103
00:40:53,652 --> 00:40:54,720
In Tromaville?

1104
00:40:54,820 --> 00:40:56,588
Carting away all the
old folks in moving vans?

1105
00:40:56,688 --> 00:40:57,956
Yeah.

1106
00:40:58,056 --> 00:41:00,492
And they're not even using the
kind with those heavy pads.

1107
00:41:00,592 --> 00:41:04,295
Fellas, it's time for us to
dish out a little justice.

1108
00:41:04,395 --> 00:41:05,797
Toxic Crusader style.

1109
00:41:05,897 --> 00:41:06,998
All right.

1110
00:41:07,098 --> 00:41:09,868
Excellent notion, Tox-man.

1111
00:41:09,968 --> 00:41:12,938
(SINGING) We're
the Toxic Crusaders.

1112
00:41:13,038 --> 00:41:16,074
We're the Toxic Crusaders.

1113
00:41:16,174 --> 00:41:19,144
We're the Toxic Crusaders.

1114
00:41:19,244 --> 00:41:22,047
[inaudible]

1115
00:41:22,147 --> 00:41:24,983
We're the Toxic Crusaders.

1116
00:41:25,083 --> 00:41:27,753
We're the Toxic Crusaders.

1117
00:41:27,853 --> 00:41:28,954
Boys.

1118
00:41:29,054 --> 00:41:31,757
They're always fighting
and kicking and punching.

1119
00:41:31,857 --> 00:41:33,825
Why couldn't I have
had a little girl?

1120
00:41:33,925 --> 00:41:35,093
PSYCHO: Come on.

1121
00:41:35,193 --> 00:41:35,894
Move it, people.

1122
00:41:35,994 --> 00:41:36,862
Move it.

1123
00:41:36,962 --> 00:41:38,163
BONEHEAD: Yeah.

1124
00:41:38,263 --> 00:41:40,331
Pretend like you're going
to visit your grandchildren.

1125
00:41:40,431 --> 00:41:42,568
TOXIE: That'll be just
about enough of that.

1126
00:41:42,668 --> 00:41:43,368
Huh?

1127
00:41:43,468 --> 00:41:45,436
Who said that?

1128
00:41:45,537 --> 00:41:46,972
We did!

1129
00:41:47,072 --> 00:41:49,541
The Toxic Crusaders?

1130
00:41:49,641 --> 00:41:52,711
In the hideously deformed
and mutilated flesh.

1131
00:41:52,811 --> 00:41:54,112
Come on, bozos.

1132
00:41:54,212 --> 00:41:55,446
Let's rumble!

1133
00:41:55,547 --> 00:41:57,015
That means fight!

1134
00:41:57,115 --> 00:41:58,183
I know that.

1135
00:41:58,283 --> 00:42:00,686
I may be Psycho,
but I'm not stupid.

1136
00:42:00,786 --> 00:42:04,455
Radiation Rangers,
front and center.

1137
00:42:04,556 --> 00:42:05,891
[screams]

1138
00:42:06,958 --> 00:42:07,826
[crash]

1139
00:42:11,162 --> 00:42:11,963
It's OK, guys.

1140
00:42:12,063 --> 00:42:13,398
This is all me.

1141
00:42:18,236 --> 00:42:19,270
Hey.

1142
00:42:19,370 --> 00:42:21,773
Let's see you mutilated
morons try that on me!

1143
00:42:21,873 --> 00:42:22,574
I'll handle this.

1144
00:42:32,784 --> 00:42:34,653
Whoa!

1145
00:42:34,753 --> 00:42:35,654
[crash]

1146
00:42:37,222 --> 00:42:38,957
What-- what are you guys doing?

1147
00:42:39,057 --> 00:42:41,727
You're going on a
little space ride, man.

1148
00:42:41,827 --> 00:42:42,560
Ready to peel?

1149
00:42:42,661 --> 00:42:44,529
Three, two-- blastoff!

1150
00:42:48,099 --> 00:42:50,936
Whoa!

1151
00:42:51,036 --> 00:42:52,337
TOXIE: Don't worry.

1152
00:42:52,437 --> 00:42:55,506
Those awful people won't
be bothering you anymore.

1153
00:42:55,607 --> 00:42:56,875
Is that a promise?

1154
00:42:56,975 --> 00:42:59,444
Cross my hideous
lydeformed heart.

1155
00:42:59,544 --> 00:43:01,813
Whoops!

1156
00:43:01,913 --> 00:43:05,183
Toxic Crusaders, to thank you
for rescuing us and protecting

1157
00:43:05,283 --> 00:43:06,685
the environment,
we have prepared

1158
00:43:06,785 --> 00:43:09,187
a special celebration dinner.

1159
00:43:09,287 --> 00:43:10,055
Cool, daddio.

1160
00:43:10,155 --> 00:43:12,223
Uh, I mean, mammio.

1161
00:43:12,323 --> 00:43:14,926
We're serving powdered
eggs with mashed potatoes.

1162
00:43:15,026 --> 00:43:18,229
And for dessert, some graham
crackers dunked in hot cocoa.

1163
00:43:18,329 --> 00:43:21,332
If you need em, I'll even
donate my extra set of teeth

1164
00:43:21,432 --> 00:43:22,400
to chew it with.

1165
00:43:22,500 --> 00:43:23,368
Whoa!

1166
00:43:23,468 --> 00:43:25,603
My stomach just
did a full gator.

1167
00:43:25,704 --> 00:43:28,506
Sometimes you
really embarrass me.

1168
00:43:28,606 --> 00:43:31,009
It sounds mighty
tempting, but we hideously

1169
00:43:31,109 --> 00:43:33,444
deformed creatures of
superhuman size and strength

1170
00:43:33,544 --> 00:43:35,480
have to avoid richfoods in order

1171
00:43:35,580 --> 00:43:37,048
to maintain our fighting edge.

1172
00:43:37,148 --> 00:43:38,549
I would like the teeth, though.

1173
00:43:38,650 --> 00:43:41,252
They come in handy for pulling
pins out of hand grenades.

1174
00:43:44,289 --> 00:43:46,992
Once again, those
Toxic Crusaders have

1175
00:43:47,092 --> 00:43:49,227
destroyed my best laid plans!

1176
00:43:49,327 --> 00:43:50,962
I told you so.

1177
00:43:51,062 --> 00:43:52,197
You did what?

1178
00:43:52,297 --> 00:43:54,132
Uh, I mean, wow.

1179
00:43:54,232 --> 00:43:57,068
What an unexpected
turn of events!

1180
00:43:57,168 --> 00:44:00,906
Now how can I get rid
of those meddling mutants

1181
00:44:01,006 --> 00:44:02,407
while I carry out my plan?

1182
00:44:02,507 --> 00:44:06,077
What about an all expense paid
vacation on a tropical island?

1183
00:44:06,177 --> 00:44:07,212
I have it!

1184
00:44:07,312 --> 00:44:09,781
We'll offer the
man all expense paid

1185
00:44:09,881 --> 00:44:13,618
vacation on a tropical island.

1186
00:44:13,719 --> 00:44:15,586
What tropical island?

1187
00:44:15,687 --> 00:44:18,189
Why, this tropical
island, of course.

1188
00:44:26,531 --> 00:44:28,199
TOXIE: It's nice
of the post office

1189
00:44:28,299 --> 00:44:29,735
to send this stuff airmail.

1190
00:44:29,835 --> 00:44:31,036
They have to.

1191
00:44:31,136 --> 00:44:33,004
What mailman in his right
mind would enter this dump?

1192
00:44:33,104 --> 00:44:34,139
You're right.

1193
00:44:34,239 --> 00:44:36,374
Rain and snow and gloom
of night is one thing.

1194
00:44:36,474 --> 00:44:38,877
But toxic [inaudible] forget it.

1195
00:44:38,977 --> 00:44:40,746
Congratulations.

1196
00:44:40,846 --> 00:44:43,915
You're the lucky winner
of an all expense

1197
00:44:44,015 --> 00:44:47,418
paid vacation at Club Fred.

1198
00:44:47,518 --> 00:44:48,686
Oh, wow.

1199
00:44:48,787 --> 00:44:50,488
Totally triumphant, man.

1200
00:44:50,588 --> 00:44:52,123
A freebie vacation.

1201
00:44:52,223 --> 00:44:54,025
Bender, you're a scientist.

1202
00:44:54,125 --> 00:44:56,895
What are the odds of four
hideously deformed creatures

1203
00:44:56,995 --> 00:45:01,132
of superhuman size and strength
all winning the same contest?

1204
00:45:01,232 --> 00:45:04,469
It's got to be at
least 11 to one.

1205
00:45:04,569 --> 00:45:08,106
We better start packing
our meager belongings.

1206
00:45:08,206 --> 00:45:10,175
They've taken the bait.

1207
00:45:10,275 --> 00:45:12,577
The Toxic Crusaders
don't know it,

1208
00:45:12,677 --> 00:45:18,416
but for them, Club Fred will
soon turn out to be Club Dead.

1209
00:45:18,516 --> 00:45:19,517
[laughter]

1210
00:45:34,833 --> 00:45:37,735
Six miserable palm trees?

1211
00:45:37,836 --> 00:45:40,238
It's that all the
foliage you could find?

1212
00:45:40,338 --> 00:45:42,507
Hey, don't blame us, boss.

1213
00:45:42,607 --> 00:45:44,342
Palm trees don't grow
on trees, you know.

1214
00:45:44,442 --> 00:45:47,745
The Toxic Crusaders will
be arriving this afternoon.

1215
00:45:47,846 --> 00:45:51,850
We must disguise this island
to look like a Club Fred.

1216
00:45:51,950 --> 00:45:53,251
Trust me, boss.

1217
00:45:53,351 --> 00:45:56,754
Those bozos are so stupid, they
won't even know the difference.

1218
00:45:56,855 --> 00:45:58,089
I don't know, Chief.

1219
00:45:58,189 --> 00:45:59,690
What if every trick
we pull on them

1220
00:45:59,791 --> 00:46:01,492
backfires because
their sweet natured

1221
00:46:01,592 --> 00:46:02,861
innocence protects them?

1222
00:46:02,961 --> 00:46:05,730
And we end up getting
clobbered instead?

1223
00:46:05,831 --> 00:46:07,632
Are you starting it again?

1224
00:46:07,732 --> 00:46:08,633
Just a thought.

1225
00:46:08,733 --> 00:46:10,068
Forget I said anything.

1226
00:46:10,168 --> 00:46:11,469
[cheers]

1227
00:46:14,305 --> 00:46:15,706
They like us.

1228
00:46:15,807 --> 00:46:18,576
They really like us.

1229
00:46:18,676 --> 00:46:21,046
It's something we superheroes
must learn to live with.

1230
00:46:21,146 --> 00:46:21,980
Oh, Toxie.

1231
00:46:22,080 --> 00:46:23,014
I'll miss you so.

1232
00:46:23,114 --> 00:46:24,816
Give me a hug, you big lug.

1233
00:46:24,916 --> 00:46:25,616
A hug?

1234
00:46:25,716 --> 00:46:26,985
You bet.

1235
00:46:27,085 --> 00:46:27,819
Oh!

1236
00:46:27,919 --> 00:46:29,620
I simply melt when you hold me.

1237
00:46:29,720 --> 00:46:32,023
Sort of like those plastic
flowers you brought me?

1238
00:46:32,123 --> 00:46:32,924
YVONNE: Exactly.

1239
00:46:33,024 --> 00:46:34,325
Way cool.

1240
00:46:34,425 --> 00:46:38,163
They sent us our own
personal hovercraft.

1241
00:46:38,263 --> 00:46:39,164
[screams]

1242
00:46:43,201 --> 00:46:44,102
Bye, Yvonne!

1243
00:46:44,202 --> 00:46:46,071
Bye, Mom!

1244
00:46:46,171 --> 00:46:48,039
Always wear clean underwear!

1245
00:46:48,139 --> 00:46:52,944
You never know when you'll
get run over by a golf cart!

1246
00:46:53,044 --> 00:46:57,883
(SINGING) Welcome to Club Fred.

1247
00:46:57,983 --> 00:47:01,686
Our own tropical island.

1248
00:47:01,786 --> 00:47:05,290
We serve breakfast in bed.

1249
00:47:05,390 --> 00:47:09,627
We know you'll go home smiling.

1250
00:47:09,727 --> 00:47:10,828
Hm.

1251
00:47:10,929 --> 00:47:13,564
There's something familiar
about those two guys.

1252
00:47:13,664 --> 00:47:14,399
[sniffing]

1253
00:47:14,499 --> 00:47:16,801
I got a nose for those things.

1254
00:47:16,902 --> 00:47:18,069
Hold on.

1255
00:47:18,169 --> 00:47:20,138
This is no tropical resort.

1256
00:47:20,238 --> 00:47:21,339
It's Island City.

1257
00:47:21,439 --> 00:47:24,475
What vile scheme is Dr.
Killemoff up to this time?

1258
00:47:24,575 --> 00:47:25,276
[laughter]

1259
00:47:25,376 --> 00:47:26,544
Scheme?

1260
00:47:26,644 --> 00:47:27,778
No scheme.

1261
00:47:27,879 --> 00:47:28,980
Honest.

1262
00:47:29,080 --> 00:47:31,282
He decided to go timeshare
condo with the place.

1263
00:47:31,382 --> 00:47:32,984
Yeah, some kind of tax shelter.

1264
00:47:33,084 --> 00:47:34,886
And speaking of
shelters, wait til you

1265
00:47:34,986 --> 00:47:38,523
guys see your luxurious suite.

1266
00:47:38,623 --> 00:47:40,791
BONEHEAD: Well, what
do you think, huh?

1267
00:47:40,892 --> 00:47:42,027
This is a luxury suite?

1268
00:47:42,127 --> 00:47:44,495
A radioactive chemical
container in the middle

1269
00:47:44,595 --> 00:47:47,432
of an oozing swamp, bubbling
with poisonous gases?

1270
00:47:47,532 --> 00:47:49,067
We wanted you to feel at home.

1271
00:47:49,167 --> 00:47:50,435
And look at the way it glows.

1272
00:47:50,535 --> 00:47:53,004
You won't have to leave a
light on when you go out.

1273
00:47:53,104 --> 00:47:57,775
And believe me, we
intend to go out a lot.

1274
00:47:57,875 --> 00:47:59,110
DR. KILLEMOFF: Splendid!

1275
00:47:59,210 --> 00:48:01,746
With those dimwits
here on the island,

1276
00:48:01,846 --> 00:48:05,283
my Radiation Rangers will be
able to take over Tromaville

1277
00:48:05,383 --> 00:48:07,018
without interference.

1278
00:48:07,118 --> 00:48:10,855
Attention, attack helicopters,
activate the full scale

1279
00:48:10,956 --> 00:48:12,457
invasion of Tromaville!

1280
00:48:15,393 --> 00:48:17,895
TOXIE (VOICEOVER): While we
were off enjoying our Club Fred

1281
00:48:17,996 --> 00:48:21,466
vacation, a stranger appeared
in Tromaville whose arrival

1282
00:48:21,566 --> 00:48:24,202
would change our lives forever.

1283
00:48:24,302 --> 00:48:25,470
Hello there.

1284
00:48:25,570 --> 00:48:27,505
You must be the
Toxic Crusader's mom.

1285
00:48:27,605 --> 00:48:30,241
I-- I can see the resemblance.

1286
00:48:30,341 --> 00:48:31,943
Well, you have your nerve.

1287
00:48:32,043 --> 00:48:36,081
I, uh-- I only meant
it in the nicest sense.

1288
00:48:36,181 --> 00:48:36,914
Oh.

1289
00:48:37,015 --> 00:48:38,916
Well, in that case, thank you.

1290
00:48:39,017 --> 00:48:39,717
Yeah.

1291
00:48:39,817 --> 00:48:41,719
I'm looking for your son.

1292
00:48:41,819 --> 00:48:43,854
He's away at a
Club Fred resort,

1293
00:48:43,955 --> 00:48:46,324
enjoying a well
deserved vacation.

1294
00:48:46,424 --> 00:48:47,125
Aw.

1295
00:48:47,225 --> 00:48:49,227
I'll try again another time.

1296
00:48:49,327 --> 00:48:51,896
Uh, you-- you've been real kind.

1297
00:48:51,997 --> 00:48:53,498
Oh, and one more thing.

1298
00:48:53,598 --> 00:48:54,832
Yeah, yeah, yeah?

1299
00:48:54,932 --> 00:48:55,800
Stay off my lawn!

1300
00:48:55,900 --> 00:48:56,601
Bad dog!

1301
00:48:56,701 --> 00:48:58,269
Bad dog!

1302
00:48:58,369 --> 00:48:59,737
[howling]

1303
00:48:59,837 --> 00:49:00,705
[crash]

1304
00:49:01,506 --> 00:49:02,207
OK.

1305
00:49:02,307 --> 00:49:03,541
All set.

1306
00:49:03,641 --> 00:49:05,643
This is really going to blow
those Toxic Crusaders away.

1307
00:49:05,743 --> 00:49:06,877
You're just in time.

1308
00:49:06,978 --> 00:49:08,113
Here they come now.

1309
00:49:08,213 --> 00:49:08,913
Yo!

1310
00:49:09,014 --> 00:49:09,880
Honored guests!

1311
00:49:09,981 --> 00:49:13,018
Come on over here.

1312
00:49:13,118 --> 00:49:14,119
What's up?

1313
00:49:14,219 --> 00:49:16,354
Oh, we want to take
a picture of you guys.

1314
00:49:16,454 --> 00:49:17,655
Epic notion.

1315
00:49:17,755 --> 00:49:20,992
Maybe later we could
have it blown up.

1316
00:49:21,092 --> 00:49:22,160
You don't even have to wait.

1317
00:49:22,260 --> 00:49:23,694
You can be blown up right now.

1318
00:49:23,794 --> 00:49:25,296
What a strange looking camera.

1319
00:49:25,396 --> 00:49:26,097
Hm.

1320
00:49:26,197 --> 00:49:27,832
An Instablastic.

1321
00:49:27,932 --> 00:49:29,334
I think I've heard of them.

1322
00:49:29,434 --> 00:49:31,236
It's one of those
35 millimeter jobs.

1323
00:49:31,336 --> 00:49:32,037
Right.

1324
00:49:32,137 --> 00:49:34,072
A 35 millimeter cannon.

1325
00:49:34,172 --> 00:49:36,907
TOXIE: But first, let's take
a snapshot of you fellas.

1326
00:49:37,008 --> 00:49:37,842
No, don't!

1327
00:49:37,942 --> 00:49:38,909
Stop!

1328
00:49:39,010 --> 00:49:39,710
That's it.

1329
00:49:39,810 --> 00:49:40,645
Wave!
-No, wait!

1330
00:49:40,745 --> 00:49:41,846
Stop!
Stop!

1331
00:49:41,946 --> 00:49:42,513
-No pictures!
-Stop!

1332
00:49:47,485 --> 00:49:50,155
Boy, these new cameras sure
don't like it if you move.

1333
00:49:50,255 --> 00:49:51,522
[chatter]

1334
00:49:53,424 --> 00:49:58,129
Uh, sorry to disturb you folks,
but how do I get to Club Fred?

1335
00:49:58,229 --> 00:49:59,597
[screams]

1336
00:50:00,531 --> 00:50:01,666
Don't be afraid!

1337
00:50:01,766 --> 00:50:02,967
I don't bite!

1338
00:50:03,068 --> 00:50:04,235
See?

1339
00:50:04,335 --> 00:50:07,172
My tail is wagging.

1340
00:50:07,272 --> 00:50:08,073
[whimpering]

1341
00:50:09,040 --> 00:50:10,641
Maybe these people know.

1342
00:50:10,741 --> 00:50:11,776
Uh, hey, fellas.

1343
00:50:11,876 --> 00:50:14,145
I'm looking for a
club named Fred.

1344
00:50:14,245 --> 00:50:15,746
Is it this way?

1345
00:50:15,846 --> 00:50:17,448
Or is it that way?

1346
00:50:17,548 --> 00:50:18,849
Oh!

1347
00:50:18,949 --> 00:50:22,653
When can a bad guy get
a break around here?

1348
00:50:22,753 --> 00:50:24,655
You guys will
really enjoy this.

1349
00:50:24,755 --> 00:50:26,291
It's called windsurfing.

1350
00:50:26,391 --> 00:50:29,627
Bye bye!

1351
00:50:29,727 --> 00:50:32,197
Whoa!

1352
00:50:32,297 --> 00:50:33,298
What a joke.

1353
00:50:33,398 --> 00:50:35,500
Those dum dums don't
know it, but they're

1354
00:50:35,600 --> 00:50:39,270
headed straight for 10
tons of nuclear explosives!

1355
00:50:39,370 --> 00:50:41,172
Pretty neat, huh?

1356
00:50:41,272 --> 00:50:42,673
Hang 10, Bender!

1357
00:50:42,773 --> 00:50:43,608
OK.

1358
00:50:43,708 --> 00:50:46,977
I'll hang five,
and you hang five.

1359
00:50:47,078 --> 00:50:47,978
All right!

1360
00:50:48,079 --> 00:50:50,581
We got em this time.

1361
00:50:50,681 --> 00:50:52,049
[music playing]

1362
00:50:55,586 --> 00:50:56,454
[panting]

1363
00:50:57,622 --> 00:51:01,159
Uh, I'm looking for
the Toxic Crusader.

1364
00:51:01,259 --> 00:51:01,959
Hey!

1365
00:51:02,059 --> 00:51:02,927
Watch it!

1366
00:51:03,027 --> 00:51:04,129
[inaudible].

1367
00:51:04,229 --> 00:51:04,929
[scream]

1368
00:51:06,131 --> 00:51:06,831
Whoa!

1369
00:51:06,931 --> 00:51:07,765
What's happening?

1370
00:51:07,865 --> 00:51:09,200
I don't know.

1371
00:51:09,300 --> 00:51:10,601
Something's pulling us away.

1372
00:51:13,037 --> 00:51:13,738
Uh oh.

1373
00:51:13,838 --> 00:51:14,872
Let's move.

1374
00:51:14,972 --> 00:51:18,176
W-- what d-- does it
l--look like I'm d-- doing?

1375
00:51:18,276 --> 00:51:19,110
[crash]

1376
00:51:19,210 --> 00:51:20,545
[screams]

1377
00:51:22,580 --> 00:51:24,482
It's Bonehead and Psycho.

1378
00:51:24,582 --> 00:51:26,584
NO-ZONE: I told you
there was something

1379
00:51:26,684 --> 00:51:28,786
familiar about those guys.

1380
00:51:28,886 --> 00:51:32,457
We'd better go tell
Killemoff about this.

1381
00:51:32,557 --> 00:51:35,326
No need to, you dipsticks!

1382
00:51:35,426 --> 00:51:38,863
Dr. Killemoff already knows.

1383
00:51:38,963 --> 00:51:41,599
I don't know who
you are, but thanks.

1384
00:51:41,699 --> 00:51:43,067
The name's Junkyard.

1385
00:51:43,168 --> 00:51:45,970
Us hideously deformed critter
shave to help one another

1386
00:51:46,070 --> 00:51:47,872
in this crazy world of ours.

1387
00:51:47,972 --> 00:51:48,906
So tell us.

1388
00:51:49,006 --> 00:51:50,908
How did you become
hideously deformed?

1389
00:51:51,008 --> 00:51:52,677
Do we have timefor a flashback?

1390
00:51:52,777 --> 00:51:54,011
Oh, sure.

1391
00:51:54,111 --> 00:51:55,980
It'll take Killemoff a while
to come up with a new scheme

1392
00:51:56,080 --> 00:51:57,715
to destroy us.

1393
00:51:57,815 --> 00:52:00,851
It-- it happened some time ago.

1394
00:52:00,951 --> 00:52:02,920
It was a dark and stormy night.

1395
00:52:03,020 --> 00:52:05,156
FENDER (VOICEOVER): Man,
how come all dogs start

1396
00:52:05,256 --> 00:52:06,691
their stories the same way?

1397
00:52:06,791 --> 00:52:08,426
BENDER (VOICEOVER):
Let him finish, Fender.

1398
00:52:08,526 --> 00:52:09,360
Speak, Junkyard.

1399
00:52:09,460 --> 00:52:10,695
[barking]

1400
00:52:10,795 --> 00:52:11,629
No, no, no.

1401
00:52:11,729 --> 00:52:12,630
I mean, speak.

1402
00:52:12,730 --> 00:52:13,564
JUNKYARD (VOICEOVER): Oh.

1403
00:52:13,664 --> 00:52:14,899
[panting]

1404
00:52:14,999 --> 00:52:18,035
Well, like I was saying, it
was a dark and stormy night.

1405
00:52:18,135 --> 00:52:20,271
I was working the night
shift at the junkyard--

1406
00:52:20,371 --> 00:52:23,941
uh, that's me on the right--
when this hobo crawled in

1407
00:52:24,041 --> 00:52:25,776
to keep dry.

1408
00:52:25,876 --> 00:52:27,245
[thunder]

1409
00:52:31,816 --> 00:52:34,852
The toxic ooze had
fused us together.

1410
00:52:34,952 --> 00:52:38,423
I was now half
bow-wow and half bum.

1411
00:52:38,523 --> 00:52:40,225
Now that I could
read, I discovered

1412
00:52:40,325 --> 00:52:42,327
newspapers were good
for more than just house

1413
00:52:42,427 --> 00:52:43,494
training puppies.

1414
00:52:43,594 --> 00:52:45,730
I read about
Tromaville-- the town

1415
00:52:45,830 --> 00:52:49,434
where all hideously deformed
creatures of superhuman size

1416
00:52:49,534 --> 00:52:52,337
and strength seemed to end up.

1417
00:52:52,437 --> 00:52:53,404
Whoa.

1418
00:52:53,504 --> 00:52:55,005
You finished that
flashback just in time.

1419
00:52:55,105 --> 00:52:56,241
Look what's coming.

1420
00:52:56,341 --> 00:52:58,008
Apocalypse attack helicopters.

1421
00:52:58,108 --> 00:52:59,277
And look over there.

1422
00:52:59,377 --> 00:53:00,611
Radiation Rangers.

1423
00:53:00,711 --> 00:53:03,781
As a former military man,
I'd say we're surrounded.

1424
00:53:03,881 --> 00:53:07,785
Toxic Crusaders, let's
fight for decency and honor.

1425
00:53:07,885 --> 00:53:10,321
We could really use some
heroic music about now.

1426
00:53:10,421 --> 00:53:11,289
[music playing]

1427
00:53:12,189 --> 00:53:14,592
That's more like it.

1428
00:53:14,692 --> 00:53:16,594
What has four wheels and flies?

1429
00:53:16,694 --> 00:53:18,563
An Apocalypse garbage truck.

1430
00:53:22,667 --> 00:53:23,401
A tree!

1431
00:53:23,501 --> 00:53:24,602
I need a tree!

1432
00:53:24,702 --> 00:53:25,436
Nah.

1433
00:53:25,536 --> 00:53:26,404
It's not what you're thinking.

1434
00:53:37,615 --> 00:53:39,116
[crash]

1435
00:53:39,216 --> 00:53:40,217
Repeat after me.

1436
00:53:40,318 --> 00:53:43,421
I, Junkyard, promise
to obey all the rules

1437
00:53:43,521 --> 00:53:45,189
of the Toxic Crusaders.

1438
00:53:45,290 --> 00:53:48,259
I, Junkyard, promise
to obey all the rules

1439
00:53:48,359 --> 00:53:50,194
of the Toxic Crusaders.

1440
00:53:50,295 --> 00:53:51,862
And to stay off the furniture.

1441
00:53:51,962 --> 00:53:54,765
And to stay off the furn-- hey!

1442
00:53:54,865 --> 00:53:55,733
Just fooling.

1443
00:53:55,833 --> 00:53:57,502
Hooray for Junkyard!

1444
00:53:57,602 --> 00:53:59,704
Hooray for Junkyard!

1445
00:53:59,804 --> 00:54:02,907
And this will be your
own special house.

1446
00:54:03,007 --> 00:54:03,674
Gosh.

1447
00:54:03,774 --> 00:54:04,542
[sniffing]

1448
00:54:04,642 --> 00:54:05,510
[bark]

1449
00:54:05,610 --> 00:54:07,912
I got so much to
learn from you guys.

1450
00:54:08,012 --> 00:54:10,581
TOXIE (VOICEOVER): Meanwhile,
across the bay in Island City,

1451
00:54:10,681 --> 00:54:13,984
our old enemy, Killemoff,
was welcoming some visitors

1452
00:54:14,084 --> 00:54:16,220
from his hometown
planet, Smogula.

1453
00:54:16,321 --> 00:54:17,822
Up left aileron.

1454
00:54:17,922 --> 00:54:18,856
No, no.

1455
00:54:18,956 --> 00:54:19,957
Lift aileron.

1456
00:54:20,057 --> 00:54:21,926
You're coming in too low.

1457
00:54:22,026 --> 00:54:23,060
Watch your altitude.

1458
00:54:23,160 --> 00:54:24,995
Watch your trim tab.

1459
00:54:25,095 --> 00:54:25,963
Watch out!

1460
00:54:29,467 --> 00:54:30,568
Really, Gerba.

1461
00:54:30,668 --> 00:54:32,437
I wish you'd pay more
attention to the signals.

1462
00:54:32,537 --> 00:54:33,270
Hey.

1463
00:54:33,371 --> 00:54:35,406
Rules are for common riffraff.

1464
00:54:35,506 --> 00:54:37,408
I'm a daughter of
a czar, remember?

1465
00:54:37,508 --> 00:54:38,208
Oh.

1466
00:54:38,309 --> 00:54:40,244
How could I forget?

1467
00:54:40,345 --> 00:54:41,379
[groan]

1468
00:54:41,479 --> 00:54:44,649
Now someone get me out
of this stupid thing!

1469
00:54:44,749 --> 00:54:48,519
Allow me, Princess Gerba.

1470
00:54:48,619 --> 00:54:49,320
[crash]

1471
00:54:49,420 --> 00:54:50,120
[groan]

1472
00:54:50,220 --> 00:54:51,522
Who are you?

1473
00:54:51,622 --> 00:54:52,357
[groan]

1474
00:54:52,457 --> 00:54:54,692
I'm Dr. Killemoff.

1475
00:54:54,792 --> 00:54:55,926
Your Heaviness.

1476
00:54:56,026 --> 00:54:57,495
Uh, uh, Highness.

1477
00:54:57,595 --> 00:54:58,529
Welcome to--

1478
00:54:58,629 --> 00:54:59,330
[groan]

1479
00:54:59,430 --> 00:55:00,565
Planet Earth.

1480
00:55:00,665 --> 00:55:03,634
Killemoff, I expect you to
look after my little girl

1481
00:55:03,734 --> 00:55:05,135
during her visit here.

1482
00:55:05,235 --> 00:55:06,270
Understood?

1483
00:55:06,371 --> 00:55:08,506
Uh, you mean, you're not
staying, Your Czarship?

1484
00:55:08,606 --> 00:55:09,640
Believe me.

1485
00:55:09,740 --> 00:55:11,876
This planet isn't big
enough for both of us.

1486
00:55:11,976 --> 00:55:13,177
I believe you.

1487
00:55:13,277 --> 00:55:14,912
Well, I'll be
holographing off now.

1488
00:55:15,012 --> 00:55:15,780
Ta ta.

1489
00:55:18,649 --> 00:55:21,486
TOXIE (VOICEOVER): Then,
fate took a strange twist.

1490
00:55:21,586 --> 00:55:23,654
It all started in
the Tromaville Mall

1491
00:55:23,754 --> 00:55:25,356
where Princess
Gerba was fighting

1492
00:55:25,456 --> 00:55:27,858
the recession single-handedly.

1493
00:55:27,958 --> 00:55:31,061
Ain't you finished shopping
yet, Princess Gerba?

1494
00:55:31,161 --> 00:55:33,197
These boxes are heavy.

1495
00:55:33,297 --> 00:55:35,700
What a couple of wimps!

1496
00:55:35,800 --> 00:55:38,436
Quit complaining and join a gym.

1497
00:55:38,536 --> 00:55:42,507
This royal princess
is a royal pain.

1498
00:55:42,607 --> 00:55:43,841
Stop!

1499
00:55:43,941 --> 00:55:45,342
Lingerie alert.

1500
00:55:45,443 --> 00:55:48,513
Oh, that would
look darling on me.

1501
00:55:48,613 --> 00:55:50,715
I wonder if it comes in blue.

1502
00:55:50,815 --> 00:55:52,583
I wonder if it comes in blimp.

1503
00:55:52,683 --> 00:55:53,684
Let's see.

1504
00:55:53,784 --> 00:55:58,055
I want that one and
that one and that one.

1505
00:55:58,155 --> 00:56:01,225
And especially that one!

1506
00:56:01,325 --> 00:56:03,894
Who is that
magnificent creature?

1507
00:56:03,994 --> 00:56:06,831
You mean that hideously
deformed creature of superhuman

1508
00:56:06,931 --> 00:56:08,132
size and strength?

1509
00:56:08,232 --> 00:56:09,400
That's the one.

1510
00:56:09,500 --> 00:56:10,835
What a hunk!

1511
00:56:10,935 --> 00:56:11,702
Yeah, well, forget it.

1512
00:56:11,802 --> 00:56:12,803
That's Toxie.

1513
00:56:12,903 --> 00:56:14,304
And he's already
got a girlfriend.

1514
00:56:14,405 --> 00:56:16,373
Not anymore, he doesn't.

1515
00:56:16,474 --> 00:56:19,977
What Gerba wants, Gerba gets.

1516
00:56:20,077 --> 00:56:21,412
TOXIE (VOICEOVER):
This next scene

1517
00:56:21,512 --> 00:56:25,049
is kind of embarrassing, because
it's all about how cute I am.

1518
00:56:25,149 --> 00:56:27,518
So if you don't mind, I'm
not going to watch it.

1519
00:56:27,618 --> 00:56:30,387
Killemoff, I just met
the man of my dreams.

1520
00:56:30,488 --> 00:56:33,658
He's lean, he's mean,
and he's kind of green.

1521
00:56:33,758 --> 00:56:36,661
He sounds, uh, most attractive.

1522
00:56:36,761 --> 00:56:38,463
She's talking
about Toxie, Boss.

1523
00:56:38,563 --> 00:56:39,263
Look.

1524
00:56:39,363 --> 00:56:40,264
I want to marry him.

1525
00:56:40,364 --> 00:56:42,232
And I want you to
arrange it for me.

1526
00:56:42,332 --> 00:56:43,934
I'm sorry, Princess Gerba.

1527
00:56:44,034 --> 00:56:47,204
I'm a ruthless villain,
not a marriage broker.

1528
00:56:47,304 --> 00:56:49,106
You're absolutely right, boss.

1529
00:56:49,206 --> 00:56:51,842
Besides, what if something
happened at the last minute

1530
00:56:51,942 --> 00:56:54,244
to screw up the wedding
and Czar Zosta ended

1531
00:56:54,344 --> 00:56:56,547
up madder at you than ever?

1532
00:56:56,647 --> 00:56:58,348
Psycho, you babbling idiot!

1533
00:56:58,449 --> 00:57:01,952
Why must you always
give away the plot?

1534
00:57:02,052 --> 00:57:02,853
Sorry, Doc.

1535
00:57:02,953 --> 00:57:04,855
I guess it's like
biting my nails.

1536
00:57:04,955 --> 00:57:07,091
I can't stop.

1537
00:57:07,191 --> 00:57:08,926
TOXIE (VOICEOVER):
Meanwhile, back at the dump,

1538
00:57:09,026 --> 00:57:11,529
our shack sweetshack was visited

1539
00:57:11,629 --> 00:57:13,964
by a mysterious guy in a cape.

1540
00:57:14,064 --> 00:57:18,569
Whoever he was, he
was a heavy smoker.

1541
00:57:18,669 --> 00:57:19,537
[doorbell]

1542
00:57:19,637 --> 00:57:20,538
Hello?

1543
00:57:20,638 --> 00:57:21,639
Hello yourself.

1544
00:57:21,739 --> 00:57:23,708
I'd like to show you
what's in this suitcase.

1545
00:57:28,378 --> 00:57:29,279
[squeak]

1546
00:57:30,347 --> 00:57:31,749
[coughing]

1547
00:57:31,849 --> 00:57:32,850
What in blazes?

1548
00:57:32,950 --> 00:57:33,884
Sorry.

1549
00:57:33,984 --> 00:57:35,419
He thought you were
a Fuller Brush man

1550
00:57:35,520 --> 00:57:37,121
trying to sell me a new mop.

1551
00:57:37,221 --> 00:57:39,524
Couldn't the idiot see
that it's me, Dr. Killemoff?

1552
00:57:42,159 --> 00:57:43,694
Are we alone?

1553
00:57:43,794 --> 00:57:46,664
It's just you and me and
about seven million viewers.

1554
00:57:46,764 --> 00:57:47,865
Good.

1555
00:57:47,965 --> 00:57:50,568
Because I have some slides
I'd like to show you.

1556
00:57:50,668 --> 00:57:52,436
I hope they're
not baby pictures.

1557
00:57:52,537 --> 00:57:53,971
I get all gushy inside.

1558
00:57:54,071 --> 00:57:58,042
After you see these, you'll
be all gushy outside, too.

1559
00:58:01,345 --> 00:58:06,784
This is a Smogulan muck missle--
range 2,000 light-years.

1560
00:58:06,884 --> 00:58:08,619
This is Tromaville before.

1561
00:58:13,190 --> 00:58:17,027
This is Tromaville after.

1562
00:58:17,127 --> 00:58:18,763
How disgusting.

1563
00:58:18,863 --> 00:58:21,131
What can I do to keep
this from happening?

1564
00:58:21,231 --> 00:58:22,967
There's only one way.

1565
00:58:23,067 --> 00:58:26,470
Czar Zosta has a
daughter named Gerba.

1566
00:58:26,571 --> 00:58:28,706
Gerba thinks you're
a total hunk.

1567
00:58:28,806 --> 00:58:30,941
Gerba wants to marry you.

1568
00:58:31,041 --> 00:58:31,742
Gerp.

1569
00:58:31,842 --> 00:58:32,743
Now make your choice.

1570
00:58:32,843 --> 00:58:35,846
Either you marry
Gerba, or Tromaville is

1571
00:58:35,946 --> 00:58:38,549
completely buried in garbage.

1572
00:58:38,649 --> 00:58:40,985
Which will it be?

1573
00:58:41,085 --> 00:58:44,154
I guess I'll have to make
the supreme sacrifice.

1574
00:58:44,254 --> 00:58:47,424
After all, I'm an
environmental superhero.

1575
00:58:47,524 --> 00:58:51,896
What can I say, but oh,
I'll marry Princess Gerba.

1576
00:58:56,200 --> 00:58:58,535
(VOICEOVER) Now that I
agreed to marry Gerba,

1577
00:58:58,636 --> 00:59:01,706
I figured it was time I
broke the news to her.

1578
00:59:01,806 --> 00:59:04,074
Princess Gerba,
would you marry me?

1579
00:59:04,174 --> 00:59:05,876
Oh, why, this is so sudden!

1580
00:59:05,976 --> 00:59:08,545
I had no idea you
were going to propose.

1581
00:59:08,646 --> 00:59:09,614
Have we met?

1582
00:59:09,714 --> 00:59:12,016
I'm Toxie, a hideous
lydeformed creature

1583
00:59:12,116 --> 00:59:15,686
of superhuman size and strength
and all around nice guy.

1584
00:59:15,786 --> 00:59:17,021
Please say you'll be mine.

1585
00:59:17,121 --> 00:59:20,157
What girl could resist
such a romantic proposal?

1586
00:59:20,257 --> 00:59:22,492
The answer is-- ouch!

1587
00:59:22,593 --> 00:59:24,528
Watch it with those
pins, you klutz!

1588
00:59:24,629 --> 00:59:26,463
Or I'll peel you like a grape.

1589
00:59:26,563 --> 00:59:28,565
Now what were we discussing?

1590
00:59:28,666 --> 00:59:31,301
Oh, yeah, my marrying you.

1591
00:59:31,401 --> 00:59:36,073
The answer is yes,
yes, yes, yes, yes!

1592
00:59:36,173 --> 00:59:37,608
TOXIE (VOICEOVER):
When Mayor Grody

1593
00:59:37,708 --> 00:59:40,077
found out I was going
to marry Princess Gerba,

1594
00:59:40,177 --> 00:59:41,779
he got real upset.

1595
00:59:41,879 --> 00:59:43,413
Why should I be the only one?

1596
00:59:43,513 --> 00:59:44,581
[laughter]

1597
00:59:45,582 --> 00:59:48,619
Imagine Toxie and
some overweight

1598
00:59:48,719 --> 00:59:50,554
cockroach getting married.

1599
00:59:50,655 --> 00:59:51,889
Ew!

1600
00:59:51,989 --> 00:59:53,523
How totally gross!

1601
00:59:53,624 --> 00:59:55,660
It just gives me the shivers.

1602
00:59:55,760 --> 00:59:56,794
Yeah.

1603
00:59:56,894 --> 01:00:00,097
You'd think a cockroach
would have better taste.

1604
01:00:00,197 --> 01:00:02,199
She should have
picked you instead.

1605
01:00:02,299 --> 01:00:04,434
Then you could become
the ruler of Smogula

1606
01:00:04,534 --> 01:00:07,237
once her father, the Czar,
kicked the bucket, which would

1607
01:00:07,337 --> 01:00:10,140
probably be the same day he
found out his daughter was

1608
01:00:10,240 --> 01:00:11,341
marrying a crooked mayor.

1609
01:00:11,441 --> 01:00:12,142
[gasp]

1610
01:00:12,242 --> 01:00:14,411
What a great idea!

1611
01:00:14,511 --> 01:00:16,814
I'm surprised you thought of it.

1612
01:00:16,914 --> 01:00:19,717
Yeah, me, too.

1613
01:00:19,817 --> 01:00:21,952
TOXIE (VOICEOVER): Meanwhile,
on the planet Smogula,

1614
01:00:22,052 --> 01:00:26,190
Czar Zosta decided to reach
out and touch Dr. Killemoff.

1615
01:00:26,290 --> 01:00:28,993
He waited till six o'clock
when the rates were lower,

1616
01:00:29,093 --> 01:00:31,261
then he called him
up holographically.

1617
01:00:31,361 --> 01:00:32,496
Hologram for Dr. Killemoff.

1618
01:00:32,596 --> 01:00:36,300
Hologram for Dr. Killemoff.

1619
01:00:36,400 --> 01:00:39,436
You wished to see me, Your
Royal High and Mightiness?

1620
01:00:39,536 --> 01:00:40,370
Yes.

1621
01:00:40,470 --> 01:00:42,272
How is Gerba's
visit progressing?

1622
01:00:42,372 --> 01:00:44,141
Splendidly, Czar Zosta.

1623
01:00:44,241 --> 01:00:46,243
I was just about to call you.

1624
01:00:46,343 --> 01:00:49,814
But I was waiting until after
six when the rates are lower.

1625
01:00:49,914 --> 01:00:52,783
The Toxic Crusader has asked
for your daughter's hands

1626
01:00:52,883 --> 01:00:54,985
in marriage-- all four of them.

1627
01:00:55,085 --> 01:00:55,986
And she's accepted.

1628
01:00:56,086 --> 01:00:56,787
What?

1629
01:00:56,887 --> 01:00:58,088
My little Gerba?

1630
01:00:58,188 --> 01:01:00,457
Married to the Toxic Crusader?

1631
01:01:00,557 --> 01:01:02,526
Now, now, Your Czarship.

1632
01:01:02,626 --> 01:01:04,795
You're not losing a daughter.

1633
01:01:04,895 --> 01:01:07,865
You're gaining a mop-wielding,
toxically disfigured,

1634
01:01:07,965 --> 01:01:09,700
tutu-wearing mutant.

1635
01:01:09,800 --> 01:01:10,534
Hm.

1636
01:01:10,634 --> 01:01:12,369
I never thought of it that way.

1637
01:01:12,469 --> 01:01:15,039
Besides, with
Toxie on our side,

1638
01:01:15,139 --> 01:01:16,974
we'll be able to
invade Tromaville

1639
01:01:17,074 --> 01:01:18,909
without any resistance.

1640
01:01:19,009 --> 01:01:20,110
Excellent.

1641
01:01:20,210 --> 01:01:22,579
I'll make the wedding
arrangements immediately.

1642
01:01:22,679 --> 01:01:24,915
TOXIE (VOICEOVER): The
next part was really tough.

1643
01:01:25,015 --> 01:01:27,952
I had to break off my hot and
heavy romance with Yvonne.

1644
01:01:28,052 --> 01:01:29,053
[music playing]

1645
01:01:29,954 --> 01:01:31,055
[doorbell]

1646
01:01:31,155 --> 01:01:33,390
Why, hello, Toxie.

1647
01:01:33,490 --> 01:01:37,494
My woman's intuition tells me
that our hot and heavy romance

1648
01:01:37,594 --> 01:01:38,963
is-- over.

1649
01:01:39,063 --> 01:01:39,997
Boy.

1650
01:01:40,097 --> 01:01:41,866
I could never fool
you about anything.

1651
01:01:41,966 --> 01:01:43,700
Oh, Toxie!

1652
01:01:43,801 --> 01:01:47,371
And I thought we had
something special!

1653
01:01:47,471 --> 01:01:48,405
We did.

1654
01:01:48,505 --> 01:01:50,908
But something bigger
came between us.

1655
01:01:51,008 --> 01:01:52,109
Gerba.

1656
01:01:52,209 --> 01:01:54,611
It's either marry her or
see our beloved Tromaville

1657
01:01:54,711 --> 01:01:56,713
completely buried in garbage.

1658
01:01:56,814 --> 01:01:59,817
You great, big,
unselfish lug, you!

1659
01:01:59,917 --> 01:02:01,952
I could kiss you for that!

1660
01:02:02,052 --> 01:02:02,887
Please, Yvonne.

1661
01:02:02,987 --> 01:02:04,755
You're not making
this any easier.

1662
01:02:08,225 --> 01:02:09,059
Hey!

1663
01:02:09,159 --> 01:02:11,061
Forget that bleached
blond bimbo.

1664
01:02:11,161 --> 01:02:13,197
You belong to me now!

1665
01:02:13,297 --> 01:02:14,098
[gasp]

1666
01:02:19,103 --> 01:02:19,837
[coughing]

1667
01:02:21,071 --> 01:02:24,308
Like the song says, when
a lovely flame succumbs,

1668
01:02:24,408 --> 01:02:26,210
smoke gets in your lungs.

1669
01:02:26,310 --> 01:02:28,645
TOXIE (VOICEOVER):
Meanwhile, Dr. Killemoff

1670
01:02:28,745 --> 01:02:32,149
was cooking up another of
his evil double crosses.

1671
01:02:32,249 --> 01:02:34,952
This wedding ceremony
will be the perfect chance

1672
01:02:35,052 --> 01:02:37,121
for a political coup.

1673
01:02:37,221 --> 01:02:38,422
Uh, what's a coup?

1674
01:02:38,522 --> 01:02:41,325
A coo is half a
coo-coo, you coo-coo.

1675
01:02:41,425 --> 01:02:44,328
A coup means an overthrow!

1676
01:02:44,428 --> 01:02:48,165
Once Czar Zosta is here on
Earth, you two will grab him.

1677
01:02:48,265 --> 01:02:48,966
And throw him over?

1678
01:02:49,066 --> 01:02:49,834
[laughter]

1679
01:02:49,934 --> 01:02:51,936
Oh, I like doing
stuff like that.

1680
01:02:52,036 --> 01:02:56,306
And then I will become
the new ruler of Smogula.

1681
01:02:56,406 --> 01:02:58,843
But what if Czar Zosta's
brand new son-in-law,

1682
01:02:58,943 --> 01:03:02,446
Toxie, defends his brand new
family and cleans our clock?

1683
01:03:02,546 --> 01:03:05,115
I haven't got time
for your psychobabble.

1684
01:03:05,215 --> 01:03:08,085
I have a coup to pursue.

1685
01:03:08,185 --> 01:03:13,357
(SINGING) When Toxie was
stolen by Gerba, my heart

1686
01:03:13,457 --> 01:03:16,693
made a sound like a burp-a.

1687
01:03:16,793 --> 01:03:21,298
A gut-wrenching blow!

1688
01:03:21,398 --> 01:03:23,567
Oh, poor Yvonne.

1689
01:03:23,667 --> 01:03:25,035
Her heart is breaking.

1690
01:03:25,135 --> 01:03:26,503
[yvonne singing]

1691
01:03:28,072 --> 01:03:31,876
YVONNE (SINGING): Oh, I miss
him-- (HIGH-PITCHED) so!

1692
01:03:33,944 --> 01:03:35,279
Not to mention our mirrors.

1693
01:03:35,379 --> 01:03:39,049
That brings us to-- [inaudible]
56 years of bad luck.

1694
01:03:39,149 --> 01:03:40,784
Troops, we've got
to do something

1695
01:03:40,885 --> 01:03:42,619
to cheer up the little lady.

1696
01:03:42,719 --> 01:03:44,955
It's as plain as the
nose on No-Zone's face.

1697
01:03:45,055 --> 01:03:47,925
What Yvonne needs is
a new main squeeze.

1698
01:03:48,025 --> 01:03:48,893
Great.

1699
01:03:48,993 --> 01:03:50,961
Who are we going
to get to date her?

1700
01:03:51,061 --> 01:03:51,795
How about me?
Me!

1701
01:03:51,896 --> 01:03:52,596
Uh-uh.

1702
01:03:52,696 --> 01:03:53,763
Not you, Blobbie.

1703
01:03:53,864 --> 01:03:55,232
Someone of her own species.

1704
01:03:55,332 --> 01:03:56,033
Aw.

1705
01:03:58,802 --> 01:04:00,004
I know.

1706
01:04:00,104 --> 01:04:01,405
We'll all take her out.

1707
01:04:01,505 --> 01:04:03,007
Won't that get kind of crowded?

1708
01:04:03,107 --> 01:04:05,742
I didn't mean
all of us at once.

1709
01:04:05,842 --> 01:04:08,445
We'll take her
out one at a time.

1710
01:04:08,545 --> 01:04:11,215
TOXIE (VOICEOVER): It
wasn't easy watching my best

1711
01:04:11,315 --> 01:04:13,617
buddies romancing my best girl.

1712
01:04:13,717 --> 01:04:16,320
The first luckystiff was Junkyard.

1713
01:04:16,420 --> 01:04:19,756
Junkyard, this picnic was
a simply marvelous idea.

1714
01:04:19,856 --> 01:04:23,693
And all this time, I thought you
were nothing but a hound dog.

1715
01:04:23,793 --> 01:04:26,263
I'm a mutt of
many moods, Yvonne.

1716
01:04:26,363 --> 01:04:28,698
Permit me to dispose
of your chicken bones.

1717
01:04:33,870 --> 01:04:37,241
Can I get you anything else?

1718
01:04:37,341 --> 01:04:38,875
Maybe a shovel.

1719
01:04:38,976 --> 01:04:40,710
TOXIE (VOICEOVER): Yvonne
had just enough time

1720
01:04:40,810 --> 01:04:43,680
to wash her hair and take a
flea bath before her movie

1721
01:04:43,780 --> 01:04:46,150
matinee date with Headbanger.

1722
01:04:46,250 --> 01:04:48,118
"Attack of the Zombie Surfers."

1723
01:04:48,218 --> 01:04:49,386
Nonsense.

1724
01:04:49,486 --> 01:04:51,521
Yvonne is much too intellectual
for garbage like that.

1725
01:04:51,621 --> 01:04:53,857
We'll see paramecium on parade."

1726
01:04:53,958 --> 01:04:54,691
Zombie Surfers.

1727
01:04:54,791 --> 01:04:55,926
No. paramecium on Parade.

1728
01:04:56,026 --> 01:04:56,760
Zombie Surfers.

1729
01:04:56,860 --> 01:04:57,827
[inaudible].

1730
01:04:57,928 --> 01:04:59,429
[scream]

1731
01:04:59,529 --> 01:05:00,264
[fighting]

1732
01:05:00,364 --> 01:05:01,565
No, take this, too.

1733
01:05:01,665 --> 01:05:04,034
TOXIE (VOICEOVER): While all
this dating was going on,

1734
01:05:04,134 --> 01:05:07,104
Dr. Killemoff was going
over his latest dirty scheme

1735
01:05:07,204 --> 01:05:08,838
to Bonehead and Psycho.

1736
01:05:08,939 --> 01:05:10,140
Now here's the plan.

1737
01:05:10,240 --> 01:05:13,743
Bonehead, Psycho, grab the
end of this scroll and run.

1738
01:05:16,947 --> 01:05:19,349
What's this thing, boss?

1739
01:05:19,449 --> 01:05:22,119
A giant roll of super
sticky fly paper.

1740
01:05:22,219 --> 01:05:27,124
I plan to trap Czar Zosta in it
and make him bend to my will.

1741
01:05:27,224 --> 01:05:27,924
Yeah!

1742
01:05:28,025 --> 01:05:29,893
That should really bug him!

1743
01:05:29,994 --> 01:05:30,894
[laughter]

1744
01:05:32,829 --> 01:05:34,098
[laughter]

1745
01:05:34,999 --> 01:05:36,333
[scream]

1746
01:05:36,433 --> 01:05:37,134
No!

1747
01:05:37,234 --> 01:05:37,934
No!

1748
01:05:38,035 --> 01:05:38,969
Look out!

1749
01:05:39,069 --> 01:05:40,137
[groan]

1750
01:05:40,237 --> 01:05:41,271
[crash]

1751
01:05:41,371 --> 01:05:43,273
TOXIE (VOICEOVER): Major
Disaster-- nature lover

1752
01:05:43,373 --> 01:05:46,310
that he is-- took Yvonne
for a romantic stroll

1753
01:05:46,410 --> 01:05:47,411
under the trees.

1754
01:05:47,511 --> 01:05:48,745
[clearing throat]

1755
01:05:48,845 --> 01:05:51,148
Yvonne, your eyes are the
color of, uh, Kentucky bluegrass

1756
01:05:51,248 --> 01:05:52,916
just after it's been fertilized.

1757
01:05:53,017 --> 01:05:56,520
Why, Mayor Disaster,
you sweet talker, you.

1758
01:05:56,620 --> 01:05:58,788
Oh, look at those
gorgeous bananas.

1759
01:05:58,888 --> 01:05:59,689
Would you like one?

1760
01:05:59,789 --> 01:06:00,824
That's easy.

1761
01:06:00,924 --> 01:06:02,959
Yo, banana tree, we'll
have a ripe one to go.

1762
01:06:07,064 --> 01:06:09,433
This looks like a good one.

1763
01:06:09,533 --> 01:06:10,434
[grunt]

1764
01:06:13,037 --> 01:06:13,937
[scream]

1765
01:06:20,510 --> 01:06:21,378
[coughing]

1766
01:06:23,013 --> 01:06:25,782
One good thing about
this date-- at least

1767
01:06:25,882 --> 01:06:27,351
I won't have totake another bath.

1768
01:06:33,423 --> 01:06:35,225
Killemoff, how many time
shave I told you never

1769
01:06:35,325 --> 01:06:37,994
to hologram when I'm eating?

1770
01:06:38,095 --> 01:06:39,596
Forgive me, Your Beedleness.

1771
01:06:39,696 --> 01:06:41,731
It's about the wedding.

1772
01:06:41,831 --> 01:06:43,067
Sorry, Killemoff.

1773
01:06:43,167 --> 01:06:46,303
Only family and close
friends are invited.

1774
01:06:46,403 --> 01:06:48,738
I came to tell you
that I'd be honored

1775
01:06:48,838 --> 01:06:51,308
to pay for the entire thing.

1776
01:06:51,408 --> 01:06:54,844
Well, in that case, maybe
I could sneak you in.

1777
01:06:54,944 --> 01:06:56,980
Oh, you won't regret it, sir.

1778
01:06:57,081 --> 01:06:59,649
It will be a lovely ceremony.

1779
01:06:59,749 --> 01:07:01,485
It had better be!

1780
01:07:01,585 --> 01:07:03,453
Now bug off, Killemoff.

1781
01:07:03,553 --> 01:07:05,655
BONEHEAD: Hey,
welcome back, Doc.

1782
01:07:05,755 --> 01:07:07,124
How was the trip?

1783
01:07:07,224 --> 01:07:08,192
Excellent.

1784
01:07:08,292 --> 01:07:11,795
That bloated bug walked
right into my trap.

1785
01:07:11,895 --> 01:07:13,997
Soon you lunkheads
will be looking

1786
01:07:14,098 --> 01:07:16,966
at the new Czar of Smogula!

1787
01:07:17,067 --> 01:07:18,435
[laughter]

1788
01:07:28,645 --> 01:07:30,147
TOXIE (VOICEOVER):
There was only one

1789
01:07:30,247 --> 01:07:32,416
man in all of Tromaville
who was jealous

1790
01:07:32,516 --> 01:07:34,284
of my upcoming nuptials.

1791
01:07:34,384 --> 01:07:35,152
You guessed it.

1792
01:07:35,252 --> 01:07:36,286
Mayor Grody.

1793
01:07:36,386 --> 01:07:39,055
He still had hopes of
marrying Gerba himself

1794
01:07:39,156 --> 01:07:41,725
and becoming Czar
Zosta's son-in-law.

1795
01:07:41,825 --> 01:07:45,129
Finally, he saw his big moment.

1796
01:07:45,229 --> 01:07:46,730
What is it, Gerba?

1797
01:07:46,830 --> 01:07:47,531
Look!

1798
01:07:47,631 --> 01:07:48,465
Frozen yogurt!

1799
01:07:48,565 --> 01:07:51,000
I'm really into health foods.

1800
01:07:51,101 --> 01:07:52,536
Which flavor do you want?

1801
01:07:52,636 --> 01:07:53,337
All of em!

1802
01:07:53,437 --> 01:07:54,971
Oh, hey, what's this?

1803
01:07:55,071 --> 01:07:56,773
A surprise bridal shower?

1804
01:07:56,873 --> 01:07:57,707
[laughter]

1805
01:07:59,075 --> 01:08:00,477
I hope it's one of those
where everyone brings a dish.

1806
01:08:00,577 --> 01:08:03,713
All they had left was broccoli.

1807
01:08:03,813 --> 01:08:05,081
She's gone!

1808
01:08:05,182 --> 01:08:07,417
There's something
suspicious about this.

1809
01:08:07,517 --> 01:08:10,053
It's not like Gerba to run off
when there's food on the way.

1810
01:08:10,154 --> 01:08:11,355
Uh oh!

1811
01:08:11,455 --> 01:08:13,089
My tromatons are kicking in!

1812
01:08:13,190 --> 01:08:14,958
It's those tire tracks!

1813
01:08:15,058 --> 01:08:17,093
There's something
evil about them.

1814
01:08:17,194 --> 01:08:19,696
I'll just bet there's some
connection between them

1815
01:08:19,796 --> 01:08:21,030
and my missing bride-to-be.

1816
01:08:26,603 --> 01:08:29,573
GERBA: Are we at the
bridal shower already?

1817
01:08:29,673 --> 01:08:31,841
Oh, is that barbecue I smell?

1818
01:08:31,941 --> 01:08:33,377
Just bring me half a cow.

1819
01:08:33,477 --> 01:08:34,778
I want to leave
room for dessert.

1820
01:08:37,547 --> 01:08:38,582
Ta-da!

1821
01:08:38,682 --> 01:08:40,984
Oh, you must be
the male stripper.

1822
01:08:41,084 --> 01:08:42,085
No!

1823
01:08:42,186 --> 01:08:45,021
I'm the true love of your life.

1824
01:08:45,121 --> 01:08:46,156
Can't you see?

1825
01:08:46,256 --> 01:08:48,158
We're two of a kind.

1826
01:08:48,258 --> 01:08:49,759
Forget Toxie.
Meh.

1827
01:08:49,859 --> 01:08:50,594
Marry me.

1828
01:08:50,694 --> 01:08:52,329
I'm bugs about you.

1829
01:08:52,429 --> 01:08:55,499
Yeah, well, you've won me
over, mysterious stranger.

1830
01:08:55,599 --> 01:08:59,135
What girl could resist such a
romantically dashing approach?

1831
01:08:59,236 --> 01:08:59,969
Take me!

1832
01:09:00,069 --> 01:09:01,171
I'm yours!

1833
01:09:01,271 --> 01:09:02,038
[groan]

1834
01:09:03,307 --> 01:09:04,408
This will be just a
little fling, you realize.

1835
01:09:04,508 --> 01:09:05,209
Nothing heavy.

1836
01:09:05,309 --> 01:09:06,510
TOXIE: Gerba?

1837
01:09:06,610 --> 01:09:08,011
What's going on here?

1838
01:09:08,111 --> 01:09:08,978
Uh.

1839
01:09:09,078 --> 01:09:09,779
Toxie?

1840
01:09:09,879 --> 01:09:10,947
Thank goodness you're here!

1841
01:09:11,047 --> 01:09:12,048
[gasp]

1842
01:09:12,148 --> 01:09:14,318
This horrible thing
tried to take advantage

1843
01:09:14,418 --> 01:09:16,220
of my girlish innocence.

1844
01:09:16,320 --> 01:09:19,923
And worse than that, he
stole Mayor Grody's limousine.

1845
01:09:20,023 --> 01:09:21,891
Take that, you beast!

1846
01:09:21,991 --> 01:09:24,694
It's some kind of
weird martian creature.

1847
01:09:24,794 --> 01:09:25,662
I'll take care of him.

1848
01:09:25,762 --> 01:09:26,463
Shoo.

1849
01:09:26,563 --> 01:09:27,264
Scat.

1850
01:09:27,364 --> 01:09:28,164
Go back to your own planet.

1851
01:09:28,265 --> 01:09:29,866
Oh, my brave, hunky hero!

1852
01:09:29,966 --> 01:09:33,002
I am the luckiest girl
in the entire universe.

1853
01:09:33,102 --> 01:09:34,871
Mwah!

1854
01:09:34,971 --> 01:09:35,805
[squeak]

1855
01:09:36,940 --> 01:09:37,974
TOXIE (VOICEOVER):Finally,
the big day

1856
01:09:38,074 --> 01:09:41,144
arrived-- along with the
Smogulan wedding party.

1857
01:09:41,245 --> 01:09:44,013
Actually, I was
pretty impressed.

1858
01:09:44,113 --> 01:09:46,683
Are you with the groom's
family or the bride's?

1859
01:09:46,783 --> 01:09:47,517
Oh, I'm sorry.

1860
01:09:47,617 --> 01:09:49,219
I didn't notice your mandible.

1861
01:09:49,319 --> 01:09:51,988
TOXIE (VOICEOVER): Meanwhile,
in his Island City penthouse,

1862
01:09:52,088 --> 01:09:55,725
Dr. Killemoff was about to put
his vicious scheme into action.

1863
01:09:55,825 --> 01:09:57,026
All right, men.

1864
01:09:57,126 --> 01:10:00,129
I'm about to put my
vicious scheme into action.

1865
01:10:00,230 --> 01:10:01,431
Is there an echo in here?

1866
01:10:01,531 --> 01:10:02,198
Nah.

1867
01:10:02,299 --> 01:10:04,268
You're just hearing things.

1868
01:10:04,368 --> 01:10:05,635
Hearing things.

1869
01:10:05,735 --> 01:10:07,003
Hearing things.

1870
01:10:07,103 --> 01:10:10,907
Round up the Radiation
Rangers and wait for my signal.

1871
01:10:11,007 --> 01:10:12,041
Right, boss!

1872
01:10:12,141 --> 01:10:15,645
I can't wait to return
to the planet Smogula

1873
01:10:15,745 --> 01:10:18,348
as their new leader.

1874
01:10:18,448 --> 01:10:23,553
Best of all, the TV reception
is so much better there.

1875
01:10:23,653 --> 01:10:28,024
Dearly beloved, let the
wedding ceremony begin.

1876
01:10:28,124 --> 01:10:28,825
Hit it!

1877
01:10:28,925 --> 01:10:30,026
[music playing]

1878
01:10:30,126 --> 01:10:32,662
(SINGING) Here comes the
bride and groom so happy,

1879
01:10:32,762 --> 01:10:34,564
but I feel so doomed.

1880
01:10:34,664 --> 01:10:37,434
Cause while they're
off on their honeymoon,

1881
01:10:37,534 --> 01:10:41,137
I'll sit all alone in
my cramped little room.

1882
01:10:41,237 --> 01:10:45,208
I guess I'm doomed
to a life of gloom

1883
01:10:45,309 --> 01:10:48,177
until they put me in my tomb.

1884
01:10:48,278 --> 01:10:50,146
(HIGH-PITCHED SINGING)

1885
01:10:50,246 --> 01:10:51,615
[howling]

1886
01:10:55,685 --> 01:10:57,053
[crying]

1887
01:10:58,388 --> 01:11:01,825
Do you, Princess Gerba,
take this hideously deformed

1888
01:11:01,925 --> 01:11:04,461
creature of superhuman
size and strength

1889
01:11:04,561 --> 01:11:06,596
to be your awfully
wedded husband?

1890
01:11:06,696 --> 01:11:08,865
You bet your antenna I do.

1891
01:11:08,965 --> 01:11:11,835
And do you, Toxie,
take this incredibly

1892
01:11:11,935 --> 01:11:17,273
gorgeous specimen of womanhood
for your woof-- I mean, wife?

1893
01:11:17,374 --> 01:11:19,042
What are my choices again?

1894
01:11:19,142 --> 01:11:20,076
He does already.

1895
01:11:20,176 --> 01:11:21,210
Now get on with it!

1896
01:11:21,311 --> 01:11:22,946
I'm starved!

1897
01:11:23,046 --> 01:11:25,682
If there's anyone present
who sees any reason why

1898
01:11:25,782 --> 01:11:29,486
these two should not be join
edin marriage, let him speak now

1899
01:11:29,586 --> 01:11:31,788
or forever keep a lid on it.

1900
01:11:31,888 --> 01:11:34,624
I hate to interrupt
this touching scene,

1901
01:11:34,724 --> 01:11:37,494
but I'm about toover
throw Czar Zosta.

1902
01:11:37,594 --> 01:11:39,396
It'll just take a second.

1903
01:11:39,496 --> 01:11:42,231
Hit the deck, insects!

1904
01:11:42,332 --> 01:11:43,700
[screams]

1905
01:11:45,268 --> 01:11:46,135
[chatter]

1906
01:11:47,070 --> 01:11:48,405
Killemoff, you'll pay for this!

1907
01:11:48,505 --> 01:11:49,839
Just send me the bill!

1908
01:11:49,939 --> 01:11:50,640
[laughter]

1909
01:11:52,509 --> 01:11:55,379
Toxic Crusaders,
it's clean up time!

1910
01:11:55,479 --> 01:11:57,313
That's all I needed to hear.

1911
01:11:57,414 --> 01:11:58,348
Ah-- choo!

1912
01:12:01,985 --> 01:12:02,686
Hey, fellas!

1913
01:12:02,786 --> 01:12:03,987
Have some punch.

1914
01:12:04,087 --> 01:12:05,321
It's a knockout!

1915
01:12:05,422 --> 01:12:06,523
Watch this, Toxie's mom.

1916
01:12:06,623 --> 01:12:08,024
It's called lawn bowling.

1917
01:12:11,695 --> 01:12:12,462
Ooh, boy.

1918
01:12:12,562 --> 01:12:14,330
You got a perfect strike.

1919
01:12:14,431 --> 01:12:16,600
Someone get me out of here!

1920
01:12:16,700 --> 01:12:18,768
That's a royal command!

1921
01:12:18,868 --> 01:12:20,136
Don't worry, future
father-in-law.

1922
01:12:20,236 --> 01:12:22,038
I'll handle this.

1923
01:12:22,138 --> 01:12:23,440
[scream]

1924
01:12:25,074 --> 01:12:26,376
Here.

1925
01:12:26,476 --> 01:12:29,646
Let me help you to your feet--
or whatever those things are.

1926
01:12:29,746 --> 01:12:32,215
Son, in exchange
for freeing us,

1927
01:12:32,315 --> 01:12:35,852
I'm postponing the muck missile
attack on Tromaville til

1928
01:12:35,952 --> 01:12:36,686
next Tuesday.

1929
01:12:36,786 --> 01:12:37,621
Gosh.

1930
01:12:37,721 --> 01:12:39,556
And I thought you
were a bad guy.

1931
01:12:39,656 --> 01:12:40,657
I am.

1932
01:12:40,757 --> 01:12:44,027
You just happened to
catch me on an off day.

1933
01:12:44,127 --> 01:12:47,363
DR. KILLEMOFF: Why do these
things always happen to me?

1934
01:12:47,464 --> 01:12:49,165
I'll get you for
this, Killemoff!

1935
01:12:49,265 --> 01:12:54,137
You can run, but
you cannot hide!

1936
01:12:54,237 --> 01:12:55,705
Sorry about the
interruption, Gerba.

1937
01:12:55,805 --> 01:12:57,674
We can get on with
the wedding now.

1938
01:12:57,774 --> 01:12:59,843
Ah, forget it, zits for brains.

1939
01:12:59,943 --> 01:13:02,512
I decided to marry someone else.

1940
01:13:02,612 --> 01:13:05,715
This is the famous
Chef Wolfgang Yuck.

1941
01:13:05,815 --> 01:13:08,518
We have so much in common.

1942
01:13:08,618 --> 01:13:09,519
Come on, Woflie.

1943
01:13:09,619 --> 01:13:11,254
Let's go back to
Smogula and get to know

1944
01:13:11,354 --> 01:13:14,190
each other over four or five
dozen of your famous pizzas.

1945
01:13:17,961 --> 01:13:19,663
Hot diggity dogs.

1946
01:13:19,763 --> 01:13:23,099
Now you won't have to
marry that bow-wow Gerba.

1947
01:13:23,199 --> 01:13:24,000
[cheers]

1948
01:13:25,569 --> 01:13:27,303
Yvonne, did you
hear the good news?

1949
01:13:27,403 --> 01:13:28,538
Gerba dumped me.

1950
01:13:28,638 --> 01:13:30,073
I'm all yours.

1951
01:13:30,173 --> 01:13:34,343
That's the best news I've heard
since my last dental checkup.

1952
01:13:34,444 --> 01:13:37,413
Doesn't that wedding
cake give you some ideas?

1953
01:13:37,514 --> 01:13:39,483
It sure does.

1954
01:13:39,583 --> 01:13:42,151
Wouldn't it be a shame
to let it go to waste?

1955
01:13:42,251 --> 01:13:43,953
It sure would.

1956
01:13:44,053 --> 01:13:44,754
Come on, guys.

1957
01:13:44,854 --> 01:13:45,622
Chow time!

1958
01:13:45,722 --> 01:13:46,422
All right!

1959
01:13:46,523 --> 01:13:47,356
Save me some icing.

1960
01:13:47,457 --> 01:13:48,792
[chatter]

1961
01:13:51,761 --> 01:13:52,829
Come with me, darling.

1962
01:13:52,929 --> 01:13:55,465
I'll make you a nice
bowl of matzah ball soup.
