Yes, you were fluffier and
your skin was interesting.

539
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:49,910
But you are still the
same person on the inside.

540
00:26:49,943 --> 00:26:54,180
People love to say
that but it's not true.

541
00:26:54,214 --> 00:26:56,049
You know, when you live in a
world where your outside is more

542
00:26:56,082 --> 00:27:01,488
important than the inside,
it changes your inside.

543
00:27:01,521 --> 00:27:03,723
Not for the good.

544
00:27:03,757 --> 00:27:05,959
How much do you even
know about this guy?

545
00:27:05,992 --> 00:27:07,794
Have you run him through
your scrub me program?

546
00:27:07,827 --> 00:27:09,863
No, not yet.

547
00:27:09,896 --> 00:27:11,097
But I'm going to get his last
name at dinner tonight and then

548
00:27:11,131 --> 00:27:16,169
going deep, Instagram, Snapchat,
Facebook, background check.

549
00:27:16,202 --> 00:27:18,004
If this guy has so much as an
unpaid parking ticket I'm going

550
00:27:18,038 --> 00:27:19,606
to find it.

551
00:27:19,639 --> 00:27:21,041
Or, hear me out.

552
00:27:21,074 --> 00:27:24,177
You could just trust
that he's a good guy.

553
00:27:24,210 --> 00:27:28,148
[ Laughing ]

554
00:27:28,181 --> 00:27:30,583
Yeah because insane, psycho,
stalkers usually put that right

555
00:27:30,617 --> 00:27:32,819
in their profile.

556
00:27:32,852 --> 00:27:35,755
That reminds me, I need
to see via MySpace page.

557
00:27:35,789 --> 00:27:38,792
What, you have nothing
in your digital profile?

558
00:27:38,825 --> 00:27:41,561
Of course I do, which
is exactly why I hit it.

559
00:27:41,594 --> 00:27:43,196
Try to keep up.

560
00:27:43,229 --> 00:27:45,699
I'm all for the background
check but the other stuff,

561
00:27:45,732 --> 00:27:50,537
if you like him, you like him.

562
00:27:51,571 --> 00:27:53,006
Wait.

563
00:27:53,039 --> 00:27:53,907
What time is it?

564
00:27:53,940 --> 00:27:56,576
I have to go shave
my legs for tonight.

565
00:27:56,609 --> 00:27:58,945
We are having our
first real dinner date.

566
00:27:58,979 --> 00:28:01,181
No guy wants to find out
the girl he's talking to is

567
00:28:01,214 --> 00:28:02,248
half yeti.

568
00:28:02,282 --> 00:28:03,917
Donna, will you stay on?

569
00:28:03,950 --> 00:28:06,052
I want us to watch
housewives together.

570
00:28:06,086 --> 00:28:08,788
I have to go do
something first.

571
00:28:08,822 --> 00:28:09,357
What?

572
00:28:09,390 --> 00:28:10,190
Just take me with you.

573
00:28:10,223 --> 00:28:12,058
No.

574
00:28:12,092 --> 00:28:13,994
Wait?

575
00:28:14,027 --> 00:28:15,695
Are you pooping?

576
00:28:15,729 --> 00:28:16,963
Girls don't poop.

577
00:28:16,997 --> 00:28:18,665
Yes you do.

578
00:28:18,698 --> 00:28:21,101
No, actually we don't, ever.

579
00:28:21,134 --> 00:28:24,704
Siri, do girls poop?

580
00:28:24,738 --> 00:28:26,606
Girls do poop,
here are some videos.

581
00:28:26,639 --> 00:28:29,709
No, God no.

582
00:28:43,023 --> 00:28:45,025
Now, listen, this is a
very important night for me,

583
00:28:45,058 --> 00:28:46,126
don't you mess it up.

584
00:28:46,159 --> 00:28:48,094
Okay?

585
00:28:48,128 --> 00:28:51,865
High five.

586
00:29:04,210 --> 00:29:06,046
Fine, here.

587
00:29:06,646 --> 00:29:08,681
I'm a little bit nervous, okay.

588
00:29:10,683 --> 00:29:11,851
Okay.

589
00:29:13,787 --> 00:29:15,922
I told you no teeth.

590
00:29:15,955 --> 00:29:17,891
Hello.

591
00:29:17,924 --> 00:29:21,294
Wow, you look ravishing.

592
00:29:21,328 --> 00:29:23,963
This old thing.

593
00:29:23,997 --> 00:29:25,598
I've had it forever.

594
00:29:25,632 --> 00:29:27,801
You look quite
handsome yourself.

595
00:29:27,834 --> 00:29:29,370
Well, thank you.

596
00:29:29,403 --> 00:29:33,840
Actually, since it is our first
date, I decided to wear pants.

597
00:29:33,873 --> 00:29:35,608
Wow.

598
00:29:35,642 --> 00:29:37,210
And shoes.

599
00:29:37,243 --> 00:29:38,611
I remember those.

600
00:29:38,645 --> 00:29:41,781
Yes, it was a very
emotional reunion.

601
00:29:44,918 --> 00:29:48,254
So, Brandon, what
is your last name?

602
00:29:48,288 --> 00:29:49,756
It is Donaldson.

603
00:29:49,789 --> 00:29:51,291
What is yours?

604
00:29:51,325 --> 00:29:53,026
McConnell.

605
00:29:53,059 --> 00:29:54,861
I have been talking to you
for like eight hours today and I

606
00:29:54,894 --> 00:29:57,197
never asked you what
you do for a living.

607
00:29:57,230 --> 00:30:00,633
Well, first of all,
it was 10 and secondly,

608
00:30:00,667 --> 00:30:02,735
I work for a company that
suppresses negative Internet

609
00:30:02,769 --> 00:30:04,871
results on Google.

610
00:30:04,904 --> 00:30:06,873
Basically, we write original
content to push the stuff that

611
00:30:06,906 --> 00:30:10,344
people don't want you to
see to the third page.

612
00:30:10,377 --> 00:30:11,978
You know, you could just
click past the first two pages

613
00:30:12,011 --> 00:30:13,646
of a Google search and go
straight to the third page,

614
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:14,647
right?

615
00:30:14,681 --> 00:30:16,950
What?

616
00:30:16,983 --> 00:30:18,718
Hold on, I have to
write this down.

617
00:30:18,751 --> 00:30:20,053
I'm calling my boss.

618
00:30:20,086 --> 00:30:23,123
You have just blown this
whole operation wide open.

619
00:30:23,156 --> 00:30:27,727
I'm sorry had
to come from me.

620
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:29,762
To lock down.

621
00:30:29,796 --> 00:30:31,764
To lock down.

622
00:30:37,471 --> 00:30:39,873
Wow.

623
00:30:39,906 --> 00:30:41,308
What?

624
00:30:41,342 --> 00:30:45,078
It's just, I keep having
these moments where I realize

625
00:30:45,111 --> 00:30:48,315
certain things are
just not forever.

626
00:30:48,349 --> 00:30:52,785
Like, posting.

627
00:30:52,819 --> 00:30:56,222
Jesus, you are right.

628
00:30:56,256 --> 00:30:58,191
I mean we used to touch our
glasses together and then drink

629
00:30:58,224 --> 00:30:59,726
from them.

630
00:30:59,759 --> 00:31:02,028
We used to blow candles
out on birthday cakes,

631
00:31:02,061 --> 00:31:06,833
sliced them up and then
distribute them to children.

632
00:31:11,438 --> 00:31:14,841
So, I go into the boys bathroom
and I line up a ton of toilet

633
00:31:14,874 --> 00:31:17,143
paper and I shove
into both nostrils.

634
00:31:17,177 --> 00:31:18,845
Oh, no.

635
00:31:18,878 --> 00:31:22,715
And I'm praying, please let
me get past the next few hours

636
00:31:22,749 --> 00:31:27,421
of second-grade and no one will
know that I have a bloody nose.

637
00:31:27,454 --> 00:31:29,923
Oh, yes, full proof plan.

638
00:31:29,956 --> 00:31:31,425
Thank you.

639
00:31:31,458 --> 00:31:34,260
All right, so, it's the end
of school and I dart across the

640
00:31:34,294 --> 00:31:36,430
playground.

641
00:31:36,463 --> 00:31:39,032
I'm thinking that
I'm getting there.

642
00:31:39,065 --> 00:31:42,735
Then, there is a line of
pre-k kids walking so slowly,

643
00:31:42,769 --> 00:31:44,270
with the rope and everything.

644
00:31:44,305 --> 00:31:47,807
I feel the surge coming
but I get past them.

645
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:52,745
For some reason, I turn and then
blood just splurging out of both

646
00:31:52,779 --> 00:31:53,846
nostrils.

647
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:55,982
No.

648
00:31:56,015 --> 00:31:58,117
It's like at the end of the
Texas chainsaw massacre in the

649
00:31:58,151 --> 00:32:04,224
elevator scene in the shining
had a baby - and from that point

650
00:32:04,257 --> 00:32:10,497
until the end of the 12th grade
I was known as bloody Mary.

00:32:10,531 --> 00:32:14,133
[ Laughing ]

652
00:32:14,167 --> 00:32:16,303
Wow.

653
00:32:16,337 --> 00:32:18,305
That beats mine for sure.

654
00:32:18,339 --> 00:32:20,907
I told you that
mine was worse.

655
00:32:22,842 --> 00:32:24,445
What time is it?

656
00:32:24,478 --> 00:32:30,551
It's like 3 AM, I think.
I've got to go to bed.

657
00:32:30,584 --> 00:32:31,452
Okay.

658
00:32:31,485 --> 00:32:33,987
Good night, V.

659
00:32:34,020 --> 00:32:36,189
Is it okay that I called you, V?

660
00:32:36,222 --> 00:32:41,227
Yeah, sure.

661
00:32:41,261 --> 00:32:45,198
My best friends call me that.

662
00:32:45,231 --> 00:32:47,166
Good night.

663
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:50,236
Bloody Mary.

664
00:32:50,270 --> 00:32:52,272
I will come for you.

665
00:32:55,442 --> 00:32:57,311
Look at my new mask.

666
00:32:57,344 --> 00:32:58,445
It's cute.

667
00:32:58,479 --> 00:32:59,979
Are those little dogs?

668
00:33:00,013 --> 00:33:03,049
No, they are dicks.

669
00:33:03,082 --> 00:33:05,586
That way if anybody is like why
are there dicks on your mask?

670
00:33:05,619 --> 00:33:08,021
I can tell them, if you can
tell that they are dicks you are

671
00:33:08,054 --> 00:33:09,390
standing too close.

672
00:33:09,423 --> 00:33:11,991
Six feet apart mother fucker.

673
00:33:12,025 --> 00:33:13,293
Brilliant.

674
00:33:13,327 --> 00:33:15,128
Dick mask, yes.

675
00:33:15,161 --> 00:33:17,498
Let me take two of them.

676
00:33:17,531 --> 00:33:19,466
I made out of the T-shirt
fabric I just sold 45,

677
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:22,235
no I'm sorry 49
people ordered them.

678
00:33:22,268 --> 00:33:23,570
Do you know what this means?

679
00:33:23,604 --> 00:33:25,406
I am at the forefront.

680
00:33:25,439 --> 00:33:27,940
I'm going to be a
titan of industry.

681
00:33:27,974 --> 00:33:29,876
So, did you
get his last name?

682
00:33:29,909 --> 00:33:32,979
Yes, I did.

683
00:33:33,012 --> 00:33:33,846
Well?

684
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:36,550
Don't keep us waiting,
how bad is it?

685
00:33:36,583 --> 00:33:38,851
I haven't looked them up yet.

686
00:33:38,885 --> 00:33:41,287
I was going to and then
I thought, you know,

687
00:33:41,322 --> 00:33:46,092
I have over analyzed every
relationship that I've ever had.

688
00:33:46,125 --> 00:33:48,529
What if I just trust it?

689
00:33:48,562 --> 00:33:50,364
Maybe Miles was right?

690
00:33:50,397 --> 00:33:52,433
I'm sorry, I was looking at
my phone and then I heard maybe

691
00:33:52,466 --> 00:33:54,233
Miles is right, so I'm back.

692
00:33:54,267 --> 00:33:57,103
Okay, Brandon is going to
be joining us in a minute and I

693
00:33:57,136 --> 00:34:00,574
want to go over some ground
rules, no being psycho,

694
00:34:00,607 --> 00:34:03,444
no embarrassing stories
from when we were kids.

695
00:34:03,477 --> 00:34:04,545
What about CVS?

696
00:34:04,578 --> 00:34:06,145
Especially CVS.

697
00:34:06,179 --> 00:34:08,582
I promise nothing.

698
00:34:08,615 --> 00:34:11,250
You guys, I think I
really like this guy,

699
00:34:11,284 --> 00:34:14,921
don't screw it up for me, okay?

700
00:34:21,695 --> 00:34:23,930
Vanessa got caught
shoplifting tampons from CVS and

701
00:34:23,963 --> 00:34:25,998
peed her pants.

702
00:34:27,434 --> 00:34:30,637
I mean, hi, I'm Donna.

703
00:34:30,671 --> 00:34:33,474
Did I do that wrong?

704
00:34:33,507 --> 00:34:36,510
Going to murder you.

705
00:34:36,543 --> 00:34:39,513
Hi, everyone.

706
00:34:39,546 --> 00:34:42,583
It's nice to meet you guys.

707
00:34:42,616 --> 00:34:46,085
Hi, I would like to offer my
condolences on the loss of your

708
00:34:46,119 --> 00:34:48,655
hair.

709
00:34:48,689 --> 00:34:49,989
Brandon I am so sorry.

710
00:34:50,022 --> 00:34:51,525
No, that's okay.

711
00:34:51,558 --> 00:34:53,226
Now, when your hair
was still with us,

712
00:34:53,259 --> 00:34:56,597
what kind of
product did you use?

713
00:34:56,630 --> 00:34:57,398
Well, this was fun, guys.

714
00:34:57,431 --> 00:34:58,998
Goodbye.

715
00:34:59,031 --> 00:35:00,534
No, it's fine.

716
00:35:00,567 --> 00:35:02,503
Don't worry,
