I should stab you with
that fucking rolling pin.

00:04:43,834 --> 00:04:47,834
Oh, don't be cunty. I was just hoping we
could have a cozy little drink together.

66
00:04:48,301 --> 00:04:52,834
So, I've got a meeting on Saturday
at your favorite newspaper.

67
00:04:53,934 --> 00:04:58,368
As the best private investigator
in this smoky little town...

68
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:00,633
good evening,
ladies and gentlemen...

69
00:05:00,767 --> 00:05:04,934
they are ready to put 150 grand in
my pocket to give them some filth.

70
00:05:05,067 --> 00:05:07,368
Good for me, that,
but in this case...

71
00:05:09,101 --> 00:05:10,301
it's bad for you.

72
00:05:11,834 --> 00:05:15,434
So Big Dave,
editor extraordinaire,

73
00:05:15,567 --> 00:05:19,368
has developed a terrible
antipathy for your boss

74
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:22,201
and his liquorish assortment
of tasty mates.

75
00:05:22,334 --> 00:05:27,401
He's out to destroy him and all those
that cozy up to him. Front cover. Bosh!

76
00:05:27,533 --> 00:05:30,034
There will be blood and fucking
feathers everywhere, my darling.

77
00:05:30,633 --> 00:05:33,134
Get to it, Fletcher.
I'm starting to itch.

78
00:05:33,267 --> 00:05:36,201
Now, we both know that your boss has
very, very deep pockets,

79
00:05:36,334 --> 00:05:39,368
and I would like to invite him just
to have a teeny rummage in them.

80
00:05:40,967 --> 00:05:42,700
What the fuck
are you talking about?

81
00:05:42,834 --> 00:05:44,500
If you would be so kind

82
00:05:44,633 --> 00:05:46,134
as to furnish me with
20 million British pounds,

83
00:05:46,267 --> 00:05:47,900
I will give you everything...

84
00:05:48,034 --> 00:05:51,134
memory cards, contact sheets,
recordings, the lot,

85
00:05:51,267 --> 00:05:54,700
and a modest little screenplay
I wrote all by myself.

86
00:05:54,834 --> 00:05:55,867
Hold on.

87
00:05:56,600 --> 00:06:00,034
We just went from £150,000
to 20 million.

88
00:06:00,167 --> 00:06:02,334
That's a steep rise
in 30 seconds.

89
00:06:02,468 --> 00:06:05,301
Yeah, but I would argue that you're
lucky, because that is nothing

90
00:06:05,434 --> 00:06:09,134
compared to what I could,
and perhaps should, be asking.

91
00:06:09,267 --> 00:06:12,201
Oh, well, thank God
you're not greedy, Fletcher,

92
00:06:12,334 --> 00:06:14,700
you deluded,
shit-eating cunt.

93
00:06:14,834 --> 00:06:16,533
[chuckles]

94
00:06:16,667 --> 00:06:18,667
I quite like it
when you talk dirty to me.

95
00:06:19,867 --> 00:06:22,067
I can feel myself engorging.

96
00:06:22,834 --> 00:06:25,234
Come on, have a drink with me.
It's really yummy.

97
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:29,001
I looked it up. App-ed it.
1500 quid?

98
00:06:29,134 --> 00:06:31,734
I didn't know you could spend
that much on a bottle of scotch.

99
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:37,301
I'm gonna tell you a story to
demonstrate why my quote is my quote.

100
00:06:38,567 --> 00:06:40,267
Will you play a game
with me, Ray?

101
00:06:41,468 --> 00:06:42,967
I don't wanna play a game.

102
00:06:43,734 --> 00:06:46,468
- Please?
- No.

103
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:48,967
I said play a fucking game
with me, Ray.

105
00:07:27,792 --> 00:07:28,859
Right.

106
00:07:29,326 --> 00:07:30,426
Lovely.

107
00:07:30,925 --> 00:07:34,426
Now, I want you
to imagine a character,

108
00:07:34,559 --> 00:07:37,825
a dramatic character,
like in a book or a play or a film.

109
00:07:37,959 --> 00:07:40,559
But not digital,
not on a memory stick.

110
00:07:40,692 --> 00:07:44,126
Analog. Chemical process.
"Keep the grain in the picture," I say.

111
00:07:44,259 --> 00:07:45,758

00:07:50,725 --> 00:07:52,459
Now, I'm seeing this
through a lens, I am,

114
00:07:52,593 --> 00:07:54,359
and I'm not talking about
the small screen.

115
00:07:54,493 --> 00:07:56,092
It's not TV, Raymond.

116
00:07:56,226 --> 00:07:59,092
As I said,
old-school cinema format.

117
00:07:59,226 --> 00:08:03,025
It's what we in the business called
anamorphic, or ratio 2.35 to 1.

118
00:08:03,159 --> 00:08:05,925
And I want you to join me
on this cinematic journey,

119
00:08:06,059 --> 00:08:07,825
'cause it is cinema, Ray.

120
00:08:07,959 --> 00:08:10,925
It's beautiful,
beautiful cinema.

121
00:08:11,859 --> 00:08:14,392
Now, roll camera.

But he never finished his education,
never went home, because...

133
00:08:48,459 --> 00:08:50,625
<i>he found his vocation.</i>

134
00:08:50,758 --> 00:08:52,059
<i>A naughty vocation.</i>

135
00:08:52,892 --> 00:08:54,426
<i>He's a bad boy.</i>

<i>He starts dealing

<i>to his rich, British,

<i>He's clear and objective
about ambition</i>

140

<i>and he can surf the echelons

141
00:09:10,892 --> 00:09:14,326
<i>He knew how to take advantage
of his advantage.</i>

142
00:09:16,326 --> 00:09:17,992
<i>He was a hungry animal,
you see.</i>

143
00:09:18,126 --> 00:09:21,126
<i>He was powerful and ruthless,
cunning and quick,</i>

144
00:09:21,259 --> 00:09:23,625
<i>charismatic and smart, but...</i>

145
00:09:23,758 --> 00:09:26,493
<i>he had to do some naughty
things to get where he got,</i>

146
00:09:26,625 --> 00:09:28,259
<i>to establish his position,</i>

147

148
00:09:31,959 --> 00:09:33,959
Well, he wasn't

[Fletcher moans]

00:09:36,859 --> 00:09:38,392
<i>He had an engine

So, he's not exactly clean,

00:09:45,959 --> 00:09:47,725
He has come up the hard way.

154
00:09:47,859 --> 00:09:50,459
He's earned his position,
shall we say.

155
00:09:50,593 --> 00:09:52,292
<i>Well, that was the early days,</i>

156
00:09:52,426 --> 00:09:55,459
<i>and he cracked on with
his New World pioneer spirit.</i>

157

What's he worth today?
100, 200, 500 million?

But now the plot
begins to thicken.

He has reached

The middle class and the middle
age, they've got to him.

161
00:10:07,758 --> 00:10:11,292
They've corrupted his appetite
for the horrors. He's gone soft.

162
00:10:11,426 --> 00:10:14,292
He wanted to cash in his chips
and get out of the game,

163

the perfect customer.

00:10:35,758 --> 00:10:39,126
Yes, Raymond, I do know about
the Jewish billionaire cowboy,

171
00:10:39,259 --> 00:10:42,326
another slice of Americana
creating drama in <i>Angleterre.</i>

172
00:10:42,459 --> 00:10:46,459
And finally to Matthew Berger
blindsiding us with his donation

173
00:10:46,593 --> 00:10:49,758
to build the entire cognitive
behavioral therapy unit.

174
00:10:50,259 --> 00:10:52,593
[Fletcher] <i>So these two have met before.
Fuck knows where.</i>

175
00:10:52,725 --> 00:10:56,658
<i>Presumably at the annual international
drug dealers convention in Las Vegas.</i>

176
00:10:56,792 --> 00:10:58,859
<i>And they've done
some small deals together,</i>

177
00:10:58,992 --> 00:11:01,326
<i>but now they're ready
for the big one.</i>

178
00:11:01,459 --> 00:11:04,226
Well, that was unexpected,
Matthew.

179
00:11:04,925 --> 00:11:07,159
Now I understand why you're
seated at the head of the table.

180
00:11:07,292 --> 00:11:09,925
Snuck that one right by me, didn't
you, you naughty little girl?

181
00:11:10,292 --> 00:11:12,326
Making a splash
with the gentry.

182
00:11:12,459 --> 00:11:15,025
Oh, I like to make a splash
whenever possible.

183
00:11:15,493 --> 00:11:19,292
Well, you also seem to understand
the significance of a proper attire.

184
00:11:19,426 --> 00:11:20,825
Indeed I do.

185
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:22,259
I believe
a sense of ownership

186
00:11:22,392 --> 00:11:24,092
is vital
in every aspect of life,

187
00:11:24,226 --> 00:11:26,593
perhaps never more so than
when it comes to wardrobe.

188
00:11:26,725 --> 00:11:30,426
For every look there is a season,
and for every season a strategy.

189
00:11:30,559 --> 00:11:32,959
[Fletcher]
<i>Now starts the alpha dance.</i>

190
00:11:33,092 --> 00:11:34,725
<i>They're not really talking
about clothes, Raymond.</i>

191
00:11:34,859 --> 00:11:36,459
<i>Oh, fucking no.</i>

192
00:11:36,593 --> 00:11:38,259
<i>They're like
a pair of old doggies</i>

193
00:11:38,392 --> 00:11:40,825
<i>sniffing round one another's
intellectual assholes.</i>

194
00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:43,625
<i>It's a good old-fashioned
cock-off, Raymond.</i>

195
00:11:43,758 --> 00:11:46,459
Michael, I'm looking forward
to doing business together.

196
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:49,426
- May we excuse ourselves?
- Yes, please.

197
00:11:50,359 --> 00:11:52,159
We should say good night
to our host.

198
00:11:57,059 --> 00:11:58,392
So what do you think?

199
00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:00,493
I'm not sure.

200
00:12:00,625 --> 00:12:01,625
[Matthew] Your Grace.

201
00:12:01,758 --> 00:12:03,159
[woman] He's a fox,

202
00:12:03,292 --> 00:12:04,959
and foxes
have a predictable nature.

203
00:12:05,092 --> 00:12:06,859
Trust this Jew
about that Jew.

204
00:12:06,992 --> 00:12:08,459
If you let him
in the henhouse,

205
00:12:08,593 --> 00:12:10,459
you can expect blood
and feathers everywhere.

206
00:12:11,593 --> 00:12:14,092
Fresh from
a farmyard pheasant shoot,

207
00:12:14,226 --> 00:12:16,959
these two are starting
to like each other.

208
00:12:17,092 --> 00:12:19,625
It's looking good, Ray.
It's looking fucking good.

209
00:12:19,758 --> 00:12:22,359
- [gunshot]
- I'm impressed with what you've done with your enterprise.

210
00:12:22,493 --> 00:12:24,625
You see, try as I might,
I can't work out how you do it,

211
00:12:24,758 --> 00:12:26,526
and bush is my game.

212
00:12:26,658 --> 00:12:29,159
How does anyone grow
50 tons of super skunk

213
00:12:29,292 --> 00:12:31,192
without letting anyone else
know how they do it?

214
00:12:31,326 --> 00:12:33,725
I'm flattered to hear that
from you, Matthew.

215
00:12:33,859 --> 00:12:36,259
I imagine that big brain of yours
is sweating a stream of tears

216
00:12:36,392 --> 00:12:37,959
just trying
to figure it out.

217
00:12:38,092 --> 00:12:39,559
Brilliance
should be acknowledged.

218
00:12:39,692 --> 00:12:40,758
Mm.

219
00:12:40,892 --> 00:12:42,625
Run the numbers
by me again.

220
00:12:42,758 --> 00:12:46,326
200 million gross p.a.,
100 million net.

221
00:12:46,459 --> 00:12:47,892
But your people
know this already.

222
00:12:48,025 --> 00:12:50,092
They've swept the numbers
for months now.

223
00:12:50,226 --> 00:12:54,126
The bottom line is I'll sell
it to you for 400 million.

224
00:13:00,725 --> 00:13:03,025
But you knew that already.
Hop in.

225
00:13:03,159 --> 00:13:05,792
[Fletcher] <i>Now, I can't be specific
about the heroes and zeros,</i>

226
00:13:05,925 --> 00:13:08,359
but there was a lot of money
hanging in the balance.

227
00:13:08,493 --> 00:13:11,992
Question: What would it be
worth to have the power

228
00:13:12,126 --> 00:13:14,692
to be able to pull the plug
on an operation like that?

229
00:13:14,825 --> 00:13:18,925
Answer: A greedy man would
want half the sale price,

230
00:13:19,059 --> 00:13:22,092
but a smart man would know
that 20 million pounds

231
00:13:22,226 --> 00:13:25,625
was just about uncomfortable enough
to make everyone feel comfortable.

232
00:13:26,326 --> 00:13:29,359
You're a cunning and creative
toad, aren't you, Fletcher,

233
00:13:29,493 --> 00:13:31,326
coming up
with a plan like this?

234
00:13:31,459 --> 00:13:33,359
Yeah, but I didn't really
come up with it, did I?

235
00:13:33,493 --> 00:13:34,959
It was Big Dave.

236
00:13:35,092 --> 00:13:36,725
He commissioned me
to do a job on Mickey,

237
00:13:36,859 --> 00:13:38,392
you know, sniff about,
keep an eye on him,

238
00:13:38,526 --> 00:13:40,459
go through his bins,
reveal his sins.

239
00:13:41,092 --> 00:13:45,292
Mickey Pearson, the odious Yankee gangster.
We're gonna bury him.

240
00:13:45,426 --> 00:13:49,226
Because it seems he's got himself
a new friend. Lord Pressfield.

241
00:13:49,359 --> 00:13:52,292
Question:
Is that the Lord Pressfield?

242
00:13:52,625 --> 00:13:53,992
<i>His Grace, the duke?</i>

243
00:13:54,126 --> 00:13:56,758
Yeah. Once fourth in line
to the throne.

244
00:13:56,892 --> 00:13:58,459
Apparently Mickey Pearson
has squeaked his way

245
00:13:58,593 --> 00:14:00,892
into the crack
of his fat, posh ass.

246
00:14:02,059 --> 00:14:05,493
This is yours, Fletcher. I need a man
with your creativity, with your nose.

247
00:14:05,625 --> 00:14:07,326
Now, you know
you're my favorite bloodhound.

248
00:14:07,459 --> 00:14:09,259
I just think it's really
important to remember

249
00:14:09,392 --> 00:14:10,825
who you're talking to, Dave.

250
00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:13,159
Of course I remember,
Fletcher.

251
00:14:13,292 --> 00:14:16,192
So just make absolutely sure the
check doesn't disappoint this time.

252
00:14:17,092 --> 00:14:18,992
The number is 150,000.

253
00:14:19,326 --> 00:14:22,025
He wants to ruin him,

254
00:14:22,159 --> 00:14:25,092
but I am here
to do you a favor.

255
00:14:26,326 --> 00:14:28,992
And it's not like you're not
getting something for your money.

256
00:14:29,126 --> 00:14:32,259
You could even turn that script
into a feature film, Raymond.

257
00:14:32,825 --> 00:14:36,025
We could make it together.
We could be partners.

258
00:14:36,758 --> 00:14:38,493
I have learned off you lot.

259
00:14:38,792 --> 00:14:42,226
You gotta look after number
one, and now it's my turn.

260
00:14:43,392 --> 00:14:47,126
The sun is not going up
for me, Ray. It's going down.

261
00:14:48,526 --> 00:14:51,559
So why has Big Dave
got it in for my boss?

262
00:14:51,692 --> 00:14:53,725
Two months ago,
your man Mickey

263
00:14:53,859 --> 00:14:56,459
<i>made my man Dave feel
like a right fucking idiot.</i>

264
00:14:56,593 --> 00:14:58,459
Henry. Mickey.

265
00:14:58,593 --> 00:14:59,725
How did he do that?

266
00:14:59,859 --> 00:15:01,226
Didn't accept his hand.

267
00:15:01,359 --> 00:15:03,326
- Dave. <i>Daily Print.</i>
- Yes.

268
00:15:04,192 --> 00:15:06,259
No. Editor
of the <i>Daily Print.</i>

269
00:15:06,392 --> 00:15:09,159
[Fletcher] <i>Turns out Dave had
gone after one of Mickey's lords,</i>

270
00:15:09,292 --> 00:15:11,192
<i>did a proper tabloid job
on him.</i>

271
00:15:11,326 --> 00:15:13,493
<i>It would appear that His
Lordship had had a quick spin</i>

272
00:15:13,625 --> 00:15:15,859
<i>on one of
his attractive young footmen.</i>

273
00:15:15,992 --> 00:15:18,593
<i>After the splash, shares
crashed, job went, wife followed,</i>

274
00:15:18,725 --> 00:15:20,792
<i>and even his kids
disowned him.</i>

275
00:15:20,925 --> 00:15:23,226
<i>Well, that Dave
can't half be a cunt.</i>

276
00:15:23,992 --> 00:15:25,758
But no one
will pull him on it.

277
00:15:25,892 --> 00:15:28,192
Too fucking scared that Dave
will do a feature on them.

278
00:15:28,326 --> 00:15:31,126
<i>But your Mickey, he's got
a fabulous set of balls.</i>

279
00:15:31,259 --> 00:15:34,426
So he snubbed him in front of a crowd
that Dave could only wish he belonged to.

280
00:15:34,559 --> 00:15:37,792
You know, lords and ladies, the sort that
Mickey feels very comfortable in front of.

281
00:15:38,392 --> 00:15:40,559
Men, excuse us.

282
00:15:40,725 --> 00:15:42,725
[Fletcher] <i>Well, he might just as
well have pulled Dave's cock off.</i>

283
00:15:42,859 --> 00:15:44,593
I do believe that was a bit
of a fuck off, Dave. [laughs]

284
00:15:44,725 --> 00:15:46,692
[Fletcher] <i>'Cause he just
fizzled like a party balloon.</i>

285
00:15:47,559 --> 00:15:49,426
That's no reason
to go after a fella.

286
00:15:49,559 --> 00:15:52,226
Well, I don't know what to tell you.
He wants Mickey's blood.

287
00:15:52,359 --> 00:15:55,825
And he would be getting it
too, if it wasn't for...

288
00:15:56,859 --> 00:16:00,292
You're a filthy fantasist,
and now it's time to leave.

289
00:16:00,426 --> 00:16:03,725
Oh, don't be silly.
I'm only just lubing you up.

290
00:16:03,859 --> 00:16:08,725
Now, there is a reason why Matthew,
or anyone else for that matter,

291
00:16:08,859 --> 00:16:11,825
cannot work out
how Mickey does what he does.

292
00:16:11,959 --> 00:16:15,758
How does he grow 50 tons of white
widow super cheese every year?

293
00:16:15,892 --> 00:16:17,792
Everyone knows
that needs a lot of space.

294
00:16:17,925 --> 00:16:21,326
So where is the space and how
come he's kept it under wraps?

295
00:16:21,459 --> 00:16:24,625
<i>You can't just dig a hole in the ground
and drop 200 shipping containers in there.</i>

296
00:16:24,758 --> 00:16:26,326
<i>Oh, no, my love.
That will not work.</i>

297
00:16:26,459 --> 00:16:30,259
No. You have to be creative.
You need an angle.

298
00:16:30,392 --> 00:16:33,192
The problem with land in this
country is there's not much of it...

299
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:37,493
and there's public access even
when it's supposed to be private.

300
00:16:38,059 --> 00:16:40,959
And the public have rights:
dog walkers...

301
00:16:41,092 --> 00:16:42,758
- [horn honks]
- Yes, jog on.

302
00:16:42,892 --> 00:16:45,326
<i>...footpaths, right to roam,</i>

303
00:16:45,459 --> 00:16:46,925
<i>bimblers, ramblers,</i>

304
00:16:47,059 --> 00:16:48,493
- <i>badger lovers...</i>
- [squeaks]

305
00:16:49,226 --> 00:16:51,159
<i>...and any other busy cunt
with enough time on his hands</i>

306
00:16:51,292 --> 00:16:52,625
to sniff
the green tweed of England.

307
00:16:52,758 --> 00:16:54,259
- [man] Good morning!
- [dog barking]

308
00:16:54,392 --> 00:16:55,892
And they have groups,

309
00:16:56,025 --> 00:16:59,559
<i>forums, meetings,
social media,</i>

310
00:16:59,692 --> 00:17:01,559
<i>and they love
a good chat and a hiss</i>

311
00:17:01,692 --> 00:17:04,392
about anyone who's decided to
mow his lawn without a license.

312
00:17:05,526 --> 00:17:08,792
And then there's the helicopters,
drones, Google Earth,

313
00:17:08,925 --> 00:17:10,992
<i>heritage sites,
parish councils,</i>

314
00:17:11,126 --> 00:17:12,493
and the beat goes on.

315
00:17:13,292 --> 00:17:15,758
And that's before you even think
about getting power in here.

316
00:17:18,126 --> 00:17:21,159
[Fletcher] So what is
Mickey's unique method?

317
00:17:21,292 --> 00:17:25,792
I tip my cap at the cheek,
at the elegance, at the class.

318
00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:28,526
And what would
that method be exactly?

319
00:17:28,658 --> 00:17:30,992
You have to understand
a culture to understand a man.

320
00:17:31,658 --> 00:17:33,493
<i>Toffs, aristocrats,</i>

321
00:17:33,625 --> 00:17:36,593
<i>dukes, duchesses,
lords and ladies,</i>

322
00:17:36,725 --> 00:17:38,593
lots of land
and fuck all dough.

323
00:17:38,725 --> 00:17:42,493
<i>Houses to keep, damp to
keep out, silver to polish.</i>

324
00:17:42,625 --> 00:17:45,625
You must remember
that cash is very persuasive

325
00:17:45,758 --> 00:17:49,159
<i>to the class that got spanked by
angry lefties and death duties.</i>

326
00:17:50,426 --> 00:17:53,992
<i>And every time you inherit a
fortune, you lose half to the state.</i>

327
00:17:54,126 --> 00:17:56,126
- [slurps]
- <i>So this is my moment to swoop in</i>

328
00:17:56,259 --> 00:17:58,292
<i>like a guardian fucking angel</i>

329
00:17:58,426 --> 00:18:01,825
<i>and offer my services so they
can keep their houses in order.</i>

330
00:18:01,959 --> 00:18:04,092
And they're not too bothered
about what I do,

331
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:07,658
<i>as long as that cash
keeps rolling in each year.</i>

332
00:18:07,792 --> 00:18:10,559
It's good to get a lord, yes,
but it's not easy.

333
00:18:10,692 --> 00:18:14,493
It takes work,
wine, women and disco.

334
00:18:15,059 --> 00:18:17,825
<i>Twelve sites. Twelve farms.</i>

335
00:18:17,959 --> 00:18:20,859
<i>One thousand of these estates
in the great UK.</i>

336
00:18:20,992 --> 00:18:22,992
<i>Bonne chance</i>
trying to find them all.

337
00:18:24,159 --> 00:18:27,192
That's it. My infrastructure.

338
00:18:28,159 --> 00:18:32,758
And that, sir, is, with my
blessing, what you are paying for.

339
00:18:33,625 --> 00:18:36,192
If it's as discreet and as
lucrative as you claim it is,

340
00:18:36,326 --> 00:18:38,025
I'll buy the whole business.

341
00:18:38,326 --> 00:18:39,992
But enough foreplay, Michael.

342
00:18:40,593 --> 00:18:41,992
I wanna see your plant.

343
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:44,159
[engine stops]

344
00:18:44,292 --> 00:18:46,392
I've gone to great lengths
to make my operation

345
00:18:46,526 --> 00:18:49,059
as invisible as possible,
Matthew.

346
00:18:49,192 --> 00:18:51,625
If you were standing on my
bush, you wouldn't know it.

347
00:18:53,758 --> 00:18:57,226
As a matter of fact,
you are standing on my bush.

348
00:19:00,192 --> 00:19:02,226
It's a spectacular business,
Michael.

349
00:19:03,259 --> 00:19:05,092
Such a shame it will go
bankrupt in ten years

350
00:19:05,226 --> 00:19:07,326
when things go legal
in the great UK.

351
00:19:07,959 --> 00:19:10,292
And you want me
to pay top dollar for it?

352
00:19:10,593 --> 00:19:12,625
A nugget under half a yard?

353
00:19:13,892 --> 00:19:15,092
That is the price.

354
00:19:16,092 --> 00:19:18,859
Now step inside and I'll show
you what half a yard gets you.

355
00:19:23,825 --> 00:19:28,359
Ooh. A delightful tool shed
for 400 million dollars.

356
00:19:28,992 --> 00:19:30,792
Is the ball-peen hammer
included?

357
00:19:30,925 --> 00:19:33,825
Course it is.
Now let me show you the nails.

358
00:19:41,825 --> 00:19:42,925
Watch your head.

359
00:19:43,658 --> 00:19:44,992
Carry on, chaps.

360
00:19:56,226 --> 00:19:58,493
England's
green and pleasant land.

361
00:20:00,593 --> 00:20:02,092
Those are some nails.

362
00:20:03,459 --> 00:20:06,493
Location, staff, technology.

363
00:20:07,359 --> 00:20:11,259
See, you're buying the substructure
for the superstructure to come,

364
00:20:11,892 --> 00:20:15,559
and with purchase you will
inherit the best sites available,

365
00:20:15,692 --> 00:20:18,792
the finest botanists and herb
sommeliers in the world,

366
00:20:18,925 --> 00:20:22,493
as well as the most innovative
marijuana technology on the planet.

367
00:20:23,658 --> 00:20:26,192
And when this little piggy
goes to legal market

368
00:20:26,326 --> 00:20:29,359
and the demand
way outpaces the supply...

369
00:20:30,326 --> 00:20:33,758
these locations,
these green-fingered botanical boys,

370
00:20:33,892 --> 00:20:36,192
as well as
my superior technology,

371
00:20:36,326 --> 00:20:37,625
will be at a premium.

372
00:20:39,059 --> 00:20:40,459
And you would own them all.

373
00:20:43,292 --> 00:20:47,326
Did you know it took 15 years after
alcohol prohibition ended back home

374
00:20:47,459 --> 00:20:49,593
for the legal market
to scratch that itch?

375
00:20:50,392 --> 00:20:52,159
Fifteen years.

376
00:20:52,758 --> 00:20:54,859
And that's if
you do nothing with it.

377
00:20:55,559 --> 00:20:58,292
Yes, it's a win-win,
no matter how you look at it.

378
00:20:59,859 --> 00:21:02,126
And I'm not greedy.
You and I both know

379
00:21:02,259 --> 00:21:05,459
that 400 million is a
fair-to-generous asking price,

380
00:21:06,359 --> 00:21:08,725
especially considering
that once this game's kosher,

381
00:21:08,859 --> 00:21:11,658
it's going to be worth
somewhere between 200 billion

382
00:21:11,792 --> 00:21:15,092
and, well,
half a trillion pounds.

383
00:21:15,459 --> 00:21:16,625
Annually.

384
00:21:17,292 --> 00:21:18,658
Weed.

385
00:21:18,792 --> 00:21:19,992
Bush.

386
00:21:20,593 --> 00:21:22,092
Skunk-amola.

387
00:21:22,792 --> 00:21:24,992
White widow super cheese.

388
00:21:25,126 --> 00:21:26,459
[chuckles]

389
00:21:26,593 --> 00:21:27,959
It's the new gold rush.

390
00:21:29,126 --> 00:21:32,092
This is the thin end
of a very fat wedge, sir.

391
00:21:32,825 --> 00:21:35,758
If it's such a fat wedge,
why don't you keep it?

392
00:21:36,825 --> 00:21:41,092
You see, I've developed a reputation
as a man who came up the hard way.

393
00:21:41,825 --> 00:21:45,059
You could say that there's blood
on these pretty white hands.

394
00:21:46,059 --> 00:21:49,992
But in the new business,
once legal and under the jurisdiction

395
00:21:50,126 --> 00:21:54,126
of the respectable umbrella
of ministerial legitimacy,

396
00:21:54,259 --> 00:21:57,925
an enterprise like this will
need a face with a clean past,

397
00:21:58,059 --> 00:22:01,259
which sadly I do not possess.

398
00:22:01,392 --> 00:22:03,493
Retirement
doesn't sound so bad.

399
00:22:03,625 --> 00:22:07,059
Long walks in the countryside,
pruning roses with my better half,

400
00:22:07,192 --> 00:22:08,625
raising some cubs.

401
00:22:08,758 --> 00:22:11,326
[inhales] I've earned it.

402
00:22:12,059 --> 00:22:15,992
Look, we both know growing
is only 50% of the business.

403
00:22:16,792 --> 00:22:18,758
I need
your European connections.

404
00:22:18,892 --> 00:22:21,092
I've seen
how the sausage is made.

405
00:22:21,226 --> 00:22:22,725
Now tell me
about the butcher shops.

406
00:22:23,658 --> 00:22:25,359
Well, that comes later,
Matthew,

407
00:22:25,925 --> 00:22:27,758
when the money's in escrow.

408
00:22:27,892 --> 00:22:31,192
Now that we've established
the dilemma of our protagonist,

409
00:22:31,326 --> 00:22:34,859
let us turn to our antagonist.

410
00:22:34,992 --> 00:22:37,859
Many miles away,
across the open plains,

411
00:22:37,992 --> 00:22:43,359
another beautiful feral beast
lopes his way to a watering hole.

412
00:22:43,493 --> 00:22:44,758
Who are you talking about
now?

413
00:22:44,892 --> 00:22:48,692
I talk, Raymondo, of Dry Eye.

414
00:22:48,825 --> 00:22:50,326
Oh, Dry Eye.

415
00:22:50,459 --> 00:22:53,192
What is he?
Chinese? Japanese? Pekingese?

416
00:22:53,326 --> 00:22:54,692
Get on your fucking knees?

00:26:48,758 --> 00:26:50,459
Looks like
the deal's gone through.

500
00:26:51,326 --> 00:26:53,493
- Second thoughts?
- No second thoughts.

501
00:26:53,625 --> 00:26:55,292
I like middle age.

502
00:26:55,426 --> 00:26:58,792
I like gentrification,
private schools, fine wines

503
00:26:58,925 --> 00:27:02,658
and a spoonful of caviar
to help my medicine go down.

504
00:27:03,493 --> 00:27:06,892
But most importantly, I'm looking
forward to spending more time with you.

505
00:27:07,025 --> 00:27:08,092
Course you are.

506
00:27:08,892 --> 00:27:10,493
Look, I don't want you
knocking around here

507
00:27:10,625 --> 00:27:12,925
feeling all unemployed
and lost with yourself.

508
00:27:13,426 --> 00:27:14,825
Well, fuck me.

509
00:27:15,593 --> 00:27:17,126
Most wives would beg
their other halves

510
00:27:17,259 --> 00:27:19,059
to get out
of this game, but not you.

511
00:27:19,192 --> 00:27:20,658
That's because
I know you, darling.

512
00:27:21,758 --> 00:27:24,892
Look, you'll have to
do this elegantly, love.

513
00:27:25,559 --> 00:27:28,992
If word spreads that you're getting
out, that could read as weakness.

514
00:27:29,126 --> 00:27:31,292
And if you smell smoke,
it's 'cause there's a fire,

515
00:27:31,426 --> 00:27:33,593
and that could
get expensive.

516
00:27:33,725 --> 00:27:36,625
So you're gonna have to stamp that
out without any gentrification.

517
00:27:37,593 --> 00:27:38,658
But not you, love.

518
00:27:40,493 --> 00:27:42,192
Don't you do anything messy.

519
00:27:42,992 --> 00:27:45,259
That's why you've
got people, remember?

520
00:27:45,392 --> 00:27:47,426
[groans]
I fucking love you, babe.

521
00:27:47,559 --> 00:27:48,925
Course you do.

522
00:27:49,892 --> 00:27:51,025
Any chance?

523
00:27:52,658 --> 00:27:54,426
No, you can wait.

524
00:27:54,859 --> 00:27:57,092
I've got a red-hot Russki
with her finger on the trigger.

525
00:27:57,226 --> 00:27:59,859
- Gotta deal with it.
- I don't mind the two of yous.

526
00:27:59,992 --> 00:28:01,692
Go on, fuck off.

527
00:28:03,625 --> 00:28:04,825
Fletcher...

528
00:28:06,259 --> 00:28:07,892
why are you
wasting our time?

529
00:28:08,392 --> 00:28:10,892
I know what happens in my
world and what doesn't.

530
00:28:11,025 --> 00:28:14,126
What I fail to recognize is
why Michael should be motivated

531
00:28:14,259 --> 00:28:15,992
to write you
a check for 20 million.

532
00:28:16,126 --> 00:28:19,792
I find you very impatient, Raymond.
I am a storyteller.

533
00:28:19,925 --> 00:28:22,392
As they say in the film game,
I'm laying pipe.

534
00:28:22,758 --> 00:28:24,593
Well, you'd better put
something through it soon.

535
00:28:24,725 --> 00:28:27,126
So what is that?
Is that a barbecue as well?

536
00:28:28,925 --> 00:28:31,792
- Yes, it is, Fletcher.
- I love a barbie.

537
00:28:32,192 --> 00:28:33,959
That is a useful bit of plant,
then, isn't it?

538
00:28:34,092 --> 00:28:36,859
So that heats up your knees
and cooks at the same time?

539
00:28:36,992 --> 00:28:39,692
[chuckles] You gotta show me
how to get one of them.

540
00:28:39,825 --> 00:28:42,126
Well, you can take it with
you if you fuck off now.

541
00:28:43,292 --> 00:28:44,593
Ray.

542
00:28:45,758 --> 00:28:47,126
Is there any chance
of a steak?

543
00:28:53,059 --> 00:28:56,825
Yeah, all right. Got a bit of
Wagyu in the freezer as it happens.

544
00:28:56,959 --> 00:29:00,426
- I've never had Wagyu.
- Yeah, well, it'll be wasted on you, but it's all I've got.

545
00:29:00,559 --> 00:29:02,493
- I'll get it, mate.
- Oh, no, you're all right.

546
00:29:02,625 --> 00:29:04,526
- Just stay right there.
- Oh.

547
00:29:06,992 --> 00:29:08,159
Ow, fuck me!

548
00:29:09,625 --> 00:29:10,725
It's hot.

549
00:29:16,792 --> 00:29:18,159
[exhales]

550
00:29:18,925 --> 00:29:21,959
He's a sly fox,
that Fletcher.

551
00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:30,092
Night-night, Aslan.

552
00:29:30,792 --> 00:29:32,625
32 LS engines?

553
00:29:33,092 --> 00:29:35,292
You got all these parts
on a 40-foot container?

554
00:29:36,259 --> 00:29:37,259
Yeah.

555
00:29:38,092 --> 00:29:39,292
How'd you get
your hands on that?

556
00:29:40,892 --> 00:29:42,992
Ask no questions,
hear no lies.

557
00:29:43,459 --> 00:29:44,493
Hence the price.

558
00:29:45,459 --> 00:29:47,493
- So how much?
- Oh, no charge.

559
00:29:47,625 --> 00:29:49,925
Okay, so what's the price?

560
00:29:50,059 --> 00:29:51,259
A meeting with your husband.

561
00:29:51,392 --> 00:29:53,025
[chuckles] Oh, fuck off.

562
00:29:53,159 --> 00:29:54,392
That's not gonna happen.

563
00:29:54,959 --> 00:29:56,326
It's in his interest.

564
00:29:58,559 --> 00:30:02,792
Tell you what, keep the parts.
Consider it a gesture of goodwill.

565
00:30:04,925 --> 00:30:06,593
You know
how to get hold of me.

566
00:30:08,259 --> 00:30:10,192
Well, I can't
promise anything.

567
00:30:10,326 --> 00:30:12,758
Dry Eye, he got his little
sit-down with Michael, didn't he?

568
00:30:13,625 --> 00:30:16,792
Bold move, that,
coming in heavy,

569
00:30:16,925 --> 00:30:20,226
sanctioned or unsanctioned...

570
00:30:21,226 --> 00:30:24,259
<i>by the dragon head himself,
Lord George.</i>

571
00:30:24,925 --> 00:30:27,159
<i>Well, he's a naughty boy,
that George.</i>

572
00:30:27,559 --> 00:30:30,326
<i>But Dry Eye,
oh, he's next generation,</i>

573
00:30:30,459 --> 00:30:33,625
<i>and them Chinamen, they upgrade
quicker than i-fucking-Phones.</i>

574
00:30:33,758 --> 00:30:35,059
Is he making moves?

575
00:30:35,192 --> 00:30:36,825
[chattering]

576
00:30:36,959 --> 00:30:38,792
[Fletcher]
<i>Is he breaking out on his own?</i>

577
00:30:38,925 --> 00:30:41,426
<i>Big man plans
behind Lord George's back?</i>

578
00:30:44,392 --> 00:30:48,192
To be fair, it was very nicely played
with 100 grand's worth of free car parts,

579
00:30:48,326 --> 00:30:52,792
because everyone knows that the way
to a man's heart is through his wife.

580
00:30:55,326 --> 00:30:57,192
You'd make a lovely wife,
Raymond.

581
00:31:07,725 --> 00:31:10,192
Thank you for taking the time
to see me, Michael.

582
00:31:11,059 --> 00:31:12,526
Lord George sends his best.

583
00:31:12,959 --> 00:31:15,692
I only took this meeting
because Ros asked me to.

584
00:31:15,825 --> 00:31:17,725
Make sure to never approach
her like that again.

585
00:31:18,359 --> 00:31:19,992
I meant no disrespect.

586
00:31:30,292 --> 00:31:31,392
How can I help?

587
00:31:32,559 --> 00:31:33,925
I understand
you're getting out.

588
00:31:35,092 --> 00:31:37,892
Getting out.
Getting out of what?

589
00:31:38,025 --> 00:31:40,126
Bed? My head?
The closet?

590
00:31:40,625 --> 00:31:42,758
Don't flirt with me, Dry Eye.
I'm a busy man.

591
00:31:43,359 --> 00:31:45,092
I hear you're
getting out of the game.

592
00:31:46,459 --> 00:31:49,526
And I would like you
to consider an offer.

593
00:31:49,658 --> 00:31:51,658
Look, I'm gonna stop you
right there

594
00:31:51,792 --> 00:31:53,758
so you don't waste any more of
your precious breath, young man.

595
00:31:53,892 --> 00:31:56,092
This is not a discussion
for the two of us.

596
00:31:56,226 --> 00:31:58,259
Unlike the salt and pepper,
it's not on the table.

597
00:32:02,758 --> 00:32:05,192
This is a big number.

598
00:32:06,593 --> 00:32:09,692
[typing on phone]

599
00:32:27,226 --> 00:32:28,292
Cash.

600
00:32:28,859 --> 00:32:32,326
I am not for sale.

601
00:32:34,559 --> 00:32:37,126
And even if I was,
you're several zeros short.

602
00:32:37,259 --> 00:32:39,459
Now, you may be able to buy
your man's sausage for that,

603
00:32:39,593 --> 00:32:41,666
but to me it just looks
rude at breakfast.

604
00:32:41,934 --> 00:32:43,000
You're out of touch.

605
00:32:46,133 --> 00:32:49,334
You're forgetting the laws of the
jungle, looking down on me.

606
00:32:54,501 --> 00:32:57,501
Now, when the silverback's
got more silver than back...

607
00:32:58,601 --> 00:32:59,868
he best move on...

608
00:33:02,033 --> 00:33:03,501
before he gets moved on.

609
00:33:04,667 --> 00:33:06,200
It's not dignified.

610
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:10,834
It's beneath you, Michael.
Trying to do you a favor.

611
00:33:10,968 --> 00:33:12,167
[sighs]

612
00:33:12,868 --> 00:33:15,100
This is a big fucking number.

613
00:33:21,167 --> 00:33:22,601
And this?

614
00:33:23,434 --> 00:33:25,167
This is a big fucking gun.

615
00:33:29,067 --> 00:33:30,801
[groans]

616
00:33:32,267 --> 00:33:33,334
[squealing]

617
00:33:33,467 --> 00:33:35,100
Eyes not so dry now, are they?

618
00:33:35,234 --> 00:33:36,868
[screaming]

619
00:33:37,667 --> 00:33:38,801
Hurts, does it?

620
00:33:40,300 --> 00:33:42,501
You looking for your balls
or a hole in the wall?

621
00:33:42,634 --> 00:33:45,300
- Fuck!
- Where the fuck do you think you're going?

622
00:33:45,701 --> 00:33:49,033
Because you're not going out the way you
came in, you deluded duck-eating cunt.

623
00:33:49,167 --> 00:33:51,834
- [screams]
- Talking to me about the laws of the jungle.

624
00:33:51,968 --> 00:33:54,667
What was it? Something
about being beneath me?

625
00:33:54,801 --> 00:33:56,234
Silver on back?

626
00:33:57,434 --> 00:33:59,868
There's only one rule
in this fucking jungle.

627
00:34:00,300 --> 00:34:03,334
When the lion's hungry,
he eats.

628
00:34:05,133 --> 00:34:06,200
[Raymond]
<i>You're wrong, Fletcher.</i>

629
00:34:06,334 --> 00:34:08,000
That's not how Michael works.

630
00:34:08,133 --> 00:34:11,167
Yeah, I know. I know. I was
just having a bit of fun.

631
00:34:11,534 --> 00:34:13,400
Every movie needs
a bit of action, doesn't it?

632
00:34:13,534 --> 00:34:15,467
And it's not like Michael
doesn't have a reputation.

633
00:34:15,601 --> 00:34:17,334
Had a reputation.

634
00:34:17,968 --> 00:34:19,667
He's been gentrified.

635
00:34:20,467 --> 00:34:22,634
[audio rewinding]

636
00:34:24,667 --> 00:34:26,501
[Dry Eye]
<i>...big fucking number.</i>

637
00:34:27,067 --> 00:34:31,367
I know how you lot love fables,
so let me share a little fable with you.

638
00:34:32,934 --> 00:34:35,133
There once was
a young and foolish dragon

639
00:34:35,267 --> 00:34:37,501
who came to ask
a wise and cunning lion

640
00:34:37,634 --> 00:34:39,934
about acquiring
his territory.

641
00:34:40,067 --> 00:34:43,000
Now, the lion, he wasn't interested,
so he told the little dragon to fuck off.

642
00:34:44,467 --> 00:34:46,868
But the dragon couldn't
understand what "fuck off" meant,

643
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,834
so he persisted and
continued to ask the lion

644
00:34:49,968 --> 00:34:51,868
about acquiring
his territory.

645
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,801
So the lion took
the little dragon for a walk

646
00:34:54,934 --> 00:34:57,634
and put five bullets
in his little dragon head.

647
00:34:59,334 --> 00:35:00,801
End of story.

648
00:35:03,434 --> 00:35:06,167
Now, allegedly
there's a message in there.

649
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:09,467
I don't know what it is,
but you're a clever boy, Dry Eye.

650
00:35:09,601 --> 00:35:11,367
Maybe you can
explain it to me.

651
00:35:13,367 --> 00:35:15,167
I think your time's up,
chaps.

652
00:35:16,334 --> 00:35:18,501
Michael, you should recons...

653
00:35:18,634 --> 00:35:19,667
[tuts]

654
00:35:21,167 --> 00:35:22,367
Just marinade on it.

655
00:35:23,834 --> 00:35:25,467
In the meantime, fuck off.

656
00:35:29,801 --> 00:35:33,133
Oh, I bet Mickey was pleased he
took that meeting, wasn't he?

657
00:35:33,267 --> 00:35:35,534
Yes, it went very well.

658
00:35:35,667 --> 00:35:37,701
- Yeah.
- Do you want the top or the bottom?

659
00:35:38,167 --> 00:35:39,801
The bottom, please, darling.

660
00:35:40,634 --> 00:35:43,267
Now, things started to unravel
after that meeting.

661
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:46,300
Didn't Mickey get a rat
infestation at one of his farms?

662
00:35:52,534 --> 00:35:53,734
[man 1 whispering] Come on.

663
00:35:55,133 --> 00:35:56,200
Stealth, stealth.

664
00:35:57,667 --> 00:35:58,701
Go.

665
00:36:00,968 --> 00:36:02,300
Ballys down.

666
00:36:05,267 --> 00:36:07,200
Let's move. Go, go, go, go.

667
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,000
[man 2] Shit.

668

00:42:38,434 --> 00:42:41,334
<i>Especially to film it all
and then post it all online?</i>

833
00:42:41,467 --> 00:42:45,033
Because that is really rubbing
your face in it, isn't it?

834
00:42:45,834 --> 00:42:47,000
[Matthew]
<i>I'm here to help, Michael.</i>

835
00:42:47,133 --> 00:42:49,601
I'm your friend, your ally,

836
00:42:49,734 --> 00:42:51,667
your Santa Claus
for all seasons,

837
00:42:51,801 --> 00:42:55,601
and I'd like you to know my team
of elves can be very persuasive.

838
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:59,701
Persuasive? And why
would I need persuasive?

839
00:42:59,834 --> 00:43:03,200
Well, I hear you might have
had a little trouble.

840
00:43:04,067 --> 00:43:06,133
Now, you helped me before
when my source ran dry,

841
00:43:06,267 --> 00:43:08,701
so I'm just returning
the favor and reminding you

842
00:43:08,834 --> 00:43:10,400
I have effectual friends.

843
00:43:10,534 --> 00:43:11,801
Elves?

844
00:43:12,367 --> 00:43:13,634
Elves?

845
00:43:13,767 --> 00:43:16,534
- Yes. You said elves.
- Did I?

846
00:43:16,667 --> 00:43:17,701
Mm.

847
00:43:18,467 --> 00:43:21,968
No trouble over here, Matthew.
No trouble at all.

848
00:43:24,701 --> 00:43:26,100
So we brought you
a token.

849
00:43:26,234 --> 00:43:27,367
[Mickey] You did?

850
00:43:29,133 --> 00:43:32,834
And what might this be?

851
00:43:32,968 --> 00:43:36,367
It's a paperweight to keep down all
the paper I'm about to give you.

852
00:43:36,501 --> 00:43:39,434
- Well, it looks like a gun.
- And it's a paperweight.

853
00:43:39,567 --> 00:43:43,868
Seeing how in this country,
unlike in our homeland, they're illegal.

854
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,601
So is riding your bicycle
at night without lights.

855
00:43:46,734 --> 00:43:48,334
Laws are there
as a guideline.

856
00:43:48,467 --> 00:43:51,100
In France, it's illegal
to call a pig Napoleon,

857
00:43:51,234 --> 00:43:52,601
but just try and stop me.

858
00:43:54,567 --> 00:43:56,767
I quite like it.
You're very kind.

859
00:43:56,901 --> 00:43:59,434
- Thank you.
- Hands across the sea.

860
00:43:59,567 --> 00:44:01,601
[Fletcher]
<i>Mickey calmed down the Jew</i>

861
00:44:01,734 --> 00:44:03,334
<i>and it seems the deal
is still going ahead.</i>

862
00:44:03,801 --> 00:44:07,367
<i>But bad timing, jeopardizing
deals, shutting down farms.</i>

863
00:44:07,501 --> 00:44:11,534
<i>It could be an expensive disaster if
Mickey doesn't get this cleaned up.</i>

864
00:44:11,968 --> 00:44:13,734
[man] Should I be scared?

865
00:44:15,033 --> 00:44:18,567
[Mickey] I don't think so,
but I like to err on the side of caution.

866
00:44:18,701 --> 00:44:20,200
What does that mean?

867
00:44:20,334 --> 00:44:22,200
It means I'm going to
have to close shop,

868
00:44:22,334 --> 00:44:25,400
shut this farm down
and make it disappear.

869
00:44:25,834 --> 00:44:27,300
You might see
a couple of trucks around here

870
00:44:27,434 --> 00:44:29,167
over the next few days,
but that's it.

871
00:44:29,300 --> 00:44:31,400
Well, I'm not gonna pretend
that missing out

872
00:44:31,534 --> 00:44:34,567
on a million pounds commission a
year isn't going to hurt somewhat.

873
00:44:34,701 --> 00:44:36,300
The pain is being shared.

874
00:44:36,434 --> 00:44:39,834
Stolen product,
loss of earnings meantime,

875
00:44:39,968 --> 00:44:43,033
the cost of shutting down,
the expense of setting up elsewhere.

876
00:44:43,767 --> 00:44:45,634
It's funny, really, but
it couldn't be worse timing.

877
00:44:45,968 --> 00:44:47,267
How so?

878
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:48,634
I've...

879
00:44:49,801 --> 00:44:52,100
I've just learned we need
a whole new roof apparently.

880
00:44:52,234 --> 00:44:55,534
As I say, I'm as upset
about this as you are.

881
00:45:00,133 --> 00:45:02,200
- Henry.
- Mickey.

882
00:45:02,934 --> 00:45:06,767
[Fletcher] <i>The toffs look after Mickey.
Now Mickey looks after the toffs.</i>

883
00:45:07,434 --> 00:45:09,968
<i>But there's a lot of toffs
to look after.</i>

884
00:45:10,801 --> 00:45:12,801
- Henry.
- [Fletcher] <i>And when it rains...</i>

885
00:45:12,934 --> 00:45:14,334
Let me take care of the roof.

886
00:45:14,467 --> 00:45:16,701
[Fletcher]
<i>...it fucking pours.</i>

887
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:20,234
<i>Now, there's only one thing that
needs more looking after than a toff,</i>

888
00:45:20,367 --> 00:45:22,834
<i>and that is
a toff's offspring.</i>

889
00:45:22,968 --> 00:45:26,234
<i>Which brings me neatly back
to Big Dave's story,</i>

890
00:45:26,367 --> 00:45:28,868
<i>the very reason I'm sitting
here sipping whiskey with you</i>

891
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:30,734
<i>in the first fucking place.</i>

892
00:45:30,868 --> 00:45:34,400
<i>This is how Big Dave
is gonna bring Mickey down,</i>

893
00:45:34,534 --> 00:45:38,701
<i>by using and abusing Lord
Pressfield's much-beloved child.</i>

894
00:45:38,834 --> 00:45:43,634
Lord Pressfield's daughter, the famous and
talented Laura, all self-hate and harm,

895
00:45:43,767 --> 00:45:47,033
has fallen for this Power
Noel's smacked-out dark charm,

896
00:45:47,167 --> 00:45:48,834
and I want the lot of them,

897
00:45:49,400 --> 00:45:52,200
especially that
slimy little jam rag Pearson,

898
00:45:52,334 --> 00:45:54,868
in bed with a skint,
discredited toff,

899
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:58,701
and supplying gear to young
and reckless rock-star royals,

900
00:45:58,834 --> 00:46:01,100
royals unbridled
by distracted parents

901
00:46:01,234 --> 00:46:03,300
too busy skiing
on the Swiss Alps to notice

902
00:46:03,434 --> 00:46:05,167
and too fucking stupid
to care.

903
00:46:05,300 --> 00:46:08,000
[chuckles] I like it.
You're good at this, boss.

904
00:46:08,133 --> 00:46:10,133
Yeah, I know what I'm good at,
Hammy. Fuck off.

905
00:46:11,133 --> 00:46:15,701
<i>Aristocratic, junkie, bulimic,
auto-tuned singing daughter</i>

906
00:46:15,834 --> 00:46:18,367
<i>shacked up with some smacked-out,
once-upon-a-time pop star,</i>

907
00:46:18,501 --> 00:46:20,167
<i>and all looked after
by Mickey Pearson.</i>

908
00:46:20,300 --> 00:46:23,300
I like it.
You know, I like it a lot.

909
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:25,667
We wrapped her
in cotton wool.

910
00:46:25,801 --> 00:46:27,701
But she was
our little Lor-la.

911
00:46:29,234 --> 00:46:32,100
Charlie called her that because
she couldn't say Laura at first.

912
00:46:32,801 --> 00:46:34,501
We miss her terribly, Mickey.

913
00:46:35,601 --> 00:46:37,200
I've failed as a parent.

914
00:46:37,334 --> 00:46:39,400
You mustn't keep
beating yourself up, dear.

915
00:46:39,534 --> 00:46:42,400
Anne's right, Charles.
You mustn't blame yourselves.

916
00:46:42,534 --> 00:46:44,434
It sounds as though Laura
fell in with the wrong crowd

917
00:46:44,567 --> 00:46:47,033
at a time when she was
particularly vulnerable.

918
00:46:47,167 --> 00:46:48,767
What more
could we do?

919
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:51,701
It's happened
to so many of our friends.

920
00:46:51,834 --> 00:46:53,300
It's a curse.

921
00:46:54,634 --> 00:46:57,167
- Do you mind if I look into it?
- So you'll help us?

922
00:46:58,801 --> 00:47:00,334
Let me see what I can do.

923
00:47:04,734 --> 00:47:06,701
You should get yourself
one of these, boss.

924
00:47:06,834 --> 00:47:08,467
Well, that's the plan.

925
00:47:08,601 --> 00:47:10,100
Everything all right?

926
00:47:10,601 --> 00:47:11,934
You remember
their daughter?

927
00:47:12,067 --> 00:47:14,000
Yeah, Laura.
Nice girl. Good voice.

928
00:47:14,133 --> 00:47:17,667
Teeny sort of spunk-funk fuck pop.
Shame about the habit.

929
00:47:17,801 --> 00:47:21,067
She's gone missing. They've asked
us to find her, bring her home.

930
00:47:21,601 --> 00:47:22,567
Mm-hmm.

931
00:47:23,300 --> 00:47:24,801
Is that a problem?

932
00:47:24,934 --> 00:47:26,534
Well, I had a feeling
you might ask me this, boss,

933
00:47:26,667 --> 00:47:28,234
so I did some due diligence.

934
00:47:28,367 --> 00:47:30,067
I know where she is
and I don't like it.

935
00:47:30,200 --> 00:47:32,501
- I'd rather we didn't get involved.
- Why not?

936
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:35,000
[Raymond] <i>She's on
a South London council estate.</i>

937
00:47:35,133 --> 00:47:37,400
- [Mickey] <i>So?</i>
- It's out of our jurisdiction.

938
00:47:37,801 --> 00:47:39,834
There's too many moving parts,
parts that we can't control.

939
00:47:39,968 --> 00:47:41,801
What if she doesn't wanna come?
It's gonna get messy.

940
00:47:41,934 --> 00:47:44,634
Well, that may be true,
but you're still doing it.

941
00:47:45,667 --> 00:47:47,000
I accept that.

942
00:47:48,167 --> 00:47:49,534
But can't you
send Frazier instead?

943
00:47:49,667 --> 00:47:51,367
No, I can't
send Frazier instead.

944
00:47:51,501 --> 00:47:52,834
You're my best man.
I want you.

945
00:47:52,968 --> 00:47:54,367
[sighs]

946
00:47:59,400 --> 00:48:01,000
It's just that
I don't like smackies.

947
00:48:01,133 --> 00:48:03,167
It's the filth and the grime
and the grub in the tub.

948
00:48:03,300 --> 00:48:06,200
I'm not asking your OCD to spend
the weekend with them, Ray.

949
00:48:07,801 --> 00:48:09,367
Think of it
as philanthropy.

950
00:48:10,834 --> 00:48:12,200
Come on,
you're driving.

951
00:48:13,567 --> 00:48:15,534
No good deed
goes unpunished.

952
00:48:15,667 --> 00:48:19,734
[chuckles] And this is where you
have your moment, isn't it, Raymondo?

953
00:48:19,868 --> 00:48:21,534
This is where
you step on stage

954
00:48:21,667 --> 00:48:24,000
and set the dominoes flying
every-fucking-where.

955
00:48:25,133 --> 00:48:26,400
Meaning what?

956
00:48:26,534 --> 00:48:30,067
Meaning no good deed
goes unpunished.

957
00:48:30,501 --> 00:48:31,868
Knock, knock-knock,
knock, knock.

958
00:48:41,033 --> 00:48:42,334
<i>Buenos dias.</i>

959
00:48:43,167 --> 00:48:44,234
[man] Wrong door.

960
00:48:44,367 --> 00:48:45,534
[Raymond] Ah, ah, ah.

961
00:48:46,701 --> 00:48:50,100
My name is Raymond Smith.

962
00:48:51,100 --> 00:48:53,133
Can I step inside
for a moment, please?

963
00:48:59,567 --> 00:49:01,100
How can I help you,
Officer?

964
00:49:02,167 --> 00:49:05,367
I'm not the police. No, I just
need a moment of your time.

965
00:49:05,501 --> 00:49:07,501
It's about Laura Pressfield.

966
00:49:08,901 --> 00:49:10,434
I don't know anyone
of that name.

967
00:49:11,234 --> 00:49:13,534
It would be much easier
for all parties concerned

968
00:49:13,667 --> 00:49:15,801
if I could just step inside
for a moment.

969
00:49:16,567 --> 00:49:17,801
No, fuck off.

970
00:49:17,934 --> 00:49:19,767
[boy 1] Jeez.

971
00:49:20,334 --> 00:49:21,801
[boy 2]
That's a nice whip, bruv.

972
00:49:22,267 --> 00:49:24,467
Killer motor. It's a shame
about them rims, though.

973
00:49:24,601 --> 00:49:25,901
[boy 2]
Yeah, lend us the keys.

974
00:49:26,033 --> 00:49:27,868
Put some chrome twenty-twos
on that.

975
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,367
Hey, my man's got the Dessies
and the bootcuts, you know.

976
00:49:30,501 --> 00:49:32,200
Deffo linking a jessie.

[muffled chattering]

979
00:49:46,968 --> 00:49:48,300
[man 1] What the fuck?

980
00:49:48,434 --> 00:49:50,400
[speakers: rock music playing]

[chattering]

982
00:49:53,801 --> 00:49:56,334
- [man 1] What are you doing here?
- [man 2] Now, now, now.

983
00:49:57,067 --> 00:49:59,634
- [man 1] Get the fuck out.
- Now, now, now.

[speakers:
music continues playing]

985
00:50:05,067 --> 00:50:07,133
As you was, boys and girls.

986
00:50:18,234 --> 00:50:19,501
Sit down.

987
00:50:24,467 --> 00:50:25,667
Thank you.

988
00:50:30,367 --> 00:50:32,467
Shall we have
a little bit of fresh air?

989
00:50:33,634 --> 00:50:34,667
[music stops]

990
00:50:37,667 --> 00:50:39,801
Who the fuck
are your mates, Brown?

991
00:50:39,934 --> 00:50:43,634
No need to get excited, young man.
We will be gone in a few moments.

992
00:50:43,767 --> 00:50:46,334
No, no, no, you'll be gone before then.
Get the fuck out now.

993
00:50:49,501 --> 00:50:51,701
I can be dangerous if I want to be.
Get the fuck out now.

994
00:50:51,834 --> 00:50:55,601
Sit down, Power,
before you get yourself into more trouble.

995
00:50:55,734 --> 00:50:58,133
How d'you know my name? How
the fuck does he know my name?

996
00:50:58,267 --> 00:50:59,868
I know all your names.

997
00:51:00,567 --> 00:51:03,801
Apart from
that little anomaly.

998
00:51:04,667 --> 00:51:06,634
I know where
you went to school.

999
00:51:07,634 --> 00:51:09,601
I know who your parents are.

1000
00:51:09,734 --> 00:51:14,267
And I know you'll suck a
cock for a five-pound bag.

1001
00:51:18,334 --> 00:51:19,767
Now sit.

1002
00:51:28,667 --> 00:51:31,667
Just so we're clear,
I work for a man,

1003
00:51:32,334 --> 00:51:33,968
a powerful man.

1004
00:51:34,334 --> 00:51:35,300
Michael Pearson.

1005
00:51:35,434 --> 00:51:37,000
Ten points to you, Laura.

1006
00:51:37,133 --> 00:51:38,467
Who's Michael Pearson?

1007
00:51:38,834 --> 00:51:42,000
Friend of her father's.
Runs London's puff game.

1008
00:51:42,133 --> 00:51:43,467
A big dick swinger.

1009
00:51:43,934 --> 00:51:45,300
What is your name,
young man?

1010
00:51:46,267 --> 00:51:48,501
- Aslan.
- And where are you from, Aslan?

1011
00:51:48,634 --> 00:51:50,567
You don't sound like
one of the natives.

1012
00:51:51,167 --> 00:51:52,367
Disneyland.

1013
00:51:52,501 --> 00:51:54,067
Sounds about right.

1014
00:51:54,601 --> 00:51:56,334
Well, you are correct.
He is a big dick swinger.

1015
00:51:56,467 --> 00:51:58,801
But I wouldn't want him
to hear you say that.

1016
00:51:58,934 --> 00:52:02,667
It's best you forget what he apparently
does for a living after we depart.

1017
00:52:03,501 --> 00:52:06,868
Now, Laura, your father's
asked us to bring you home.

1018
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:08,300
She's not going anywhere.

1019
00:52:17,667 --> 00:52:18,934
Do you mind if I sit?

1020
00:52:19,067 --> 00:52:20,300
Yes.

1021
00:52:30,267 --> 00:52:35,501
[sighs] I don't build a joint like
the Americans and the new school...

1022
00:52:36,200 --> 00:52:39,968

coke-wrapping, and all that bollocks.

1023
00:52:40,501 --> 00:52:43,467
I like a good old-fashioned
50-50 mix, me.

1024
00:52:43,934 --> 00:52:45,400
That's how we used to play.

1025
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:47,801
If there's one thing
I will never understand,

1026
00:52:47,934 --> 00:52:50,033
it's why you lot
get addicted to heroin.

1027
00:52:50,634 --> 00:52:54,467
If there's one drug you should not
chase, it is the dirty dragon.

1028
00:52:55,367 --> 00:52:56,901
Did you ever
give it a spin, Bunny?

1029
00:52:57,033 --> 00:52:59,868
No, not me, Ray.
I don't even puff anymore.

1030
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:04,033
Of course not. Bunny likes the gym.
You can probably see that.

1031
00:53:04,934 --> 00:53:07,868
- What are you benching these days?
- Three wheels a side.

1032
00:53:08,767 --> 00:53:09,968
What about you, Brown?

1033
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:13,601
What about me?
[stammers] What could I lift?

1034
00:53:14,267 --> 00:53:16,968
You couldn't lift
a wheel of cheese, you cunt.

1035
00:53:20,434 --> 00:53:21,667
Now...

1036
00:53:23,567 --> 00:53:25,467
if you wanna be naughty,

1037
00:53:25,601 --> 00:53:28,634
what happened to a little smoke
and a poke and a glass of wine,

1038
00:53:28,767 --> 00:53:31,000
some Barry White,
candles around the bath

1039
00:53:31,133 --> 00:53:32,667
and put your finger
in the missus?

1040
00:53:33,467 --> 00:53:34,901
Who's Barry White?

1041
00:53:35,534 --> 00:53:36,968
[Bunny] Big black geezer.

1042
00:53:37,100 --> 00:53:38,367
Sexy voice.

1043
00:53:38,501 --> 00:53:40,300
I'm... I'm lost.

1044
00:53:40,434 --> 00:53:44,133
Am I in the bath with Barry
White's finger in my missus?

1045
00:53:44,534 --> 00:53:48,634
Be quiet, Brown. You were lost
long before Barry White walked in.

1046
00:54:00,534 --> 00:54:02,467
If you lot are unhappy,

1047
00:54:02,601 --> 00:54:05,133
you should share your thoughts
with your friends.

1048
00:54:05,767 --> 00:54:09,000
Nice friends. Talk it out,
find a positive solution.

1049
00:54:09,601 --> 00:54:13,667
But, no,
all you lot choose squalor.

1050
00:54:14,634 --> 00:54:17,167
Drowning in
your liberal white guilt.

1051
00:54:18,234 --> 00:54:19,934
Sorry,
what am I guilty of?

1052
00:54:20,067 --> 00:54:22,133
Being a cunt, Brown.

1053
00:54:23,467 --> 00:54:25,000
Being a cunt.

1054
00:54:26,467 --> 00:54:28,467
Anyway, I'm not your shrink.

1055
00:54:28,601 --> 00:54:30,801
I'm just trying to radiate
some positive vibes man to man.

1056
00:54:30,934 --> 00:54:33,467
I mean, that's what this puff
game used to be all about.

1057
00:54:36,934 --> 00:54:38,300
Anyway...

1058

Are you ready
to turn the corner?

1062

Open the curtains
and let the light in?

1063
00:54:56,467 --> 00:54:59,367
Do your mum and dad a favor
and try the impossible,

1064
00:54:59,968 --> 00:55:01,801

1065
00:55:08,100 --> 00:55:09,133
All right.

1066

That was easy.

1067
00:55:13,167 --> 00:55:14,767
All right, fantastic.

1068
00:55:14,901 --> 00:55:16,501
Well, in that case, Bunny,

1069
00:55:16,634 --> 00:55:18,767
will you help Laura
with her things, please?

1070
00:55:18,901 --> 00:55:20,634
Incoming.

1071
00:55:20,767 --> 00:55:22,667
It's all right, Bunny.
I don't really have anything.

1072
00:55:29,133 --> 00:55:30,834
It's a shithole anyway.

1073

It's all right, Bunny.
Keep going.

manhandled by a junkie cunt.

Oh, but that's not a gun,

No. It was the gravity

to invest in some parachutes.

1330
01:08:45,767 --> 01:08:47,468
There's a pattern
emerging here.

1331
01:08:47,600 --> 01:08:48,967
I'm sorry, boss.

1332
01:08:49,101 --> 01:08:51,201
And who's this
jumping Phuc boy, anyway?

1333
01:08:51,334 --> 01:08:53,834
- It's Dry Eye's man.
- You mean Lord George's man.

1334
01:08:54,368 --> 01:08:57,900
It could just be Dry Eye's doing.
He's been getting bold lately.

1335
01:08:58,034 --> 01:09:01,368
Yeah. Well,
they still all work for Lord George.

1336
01:09:02,567 --> 01:09:04,267
I'm gonna take care
of this one myself.

1337
01:09:04,401 --> 01:09:06,334
- [sizzling]
- [dishes clanking]

1338
01:09:06,468 --> 01:09:08,500
[people chattering in Chinese]

1339
01:09:18,434 --> 01:09:20,967
[announcer speaking Chinese]

1340
01:09:23,101 --> 01:09:24,934
[announcer
continues in Chinese]

1341
01:09:25,067 --> 01:09:26,767
- [door opens]
- [chimes jingle]

1342
01:09:32,301 --> 01:09:33,401
Lord George.

1343
01:09:34,001 --> 01:09:35,368
Mr. Pearson.

1344
01:09:36,834 --> 01:09:38,334
And to what do I owe?

1345
01:09:47,201 --> 01:09:48,401
[sighs]

1346
01:09:50,167 --> 01:09:51,234
What you watching?

1347
01:09:52,533 --> 01:09:54,034
I'm watching the telly.

1348
01:09:54,600 --> 01:09:56,334
What you watching
on the telly?

1349
01:09:56,468 --> 01:09:58,967
I'm watching
the horse racing.

1350
01:09:59,434 --> 01:10:02,867
Live satellite
from Hong Kong.

1351
01:10:03,834 --> 01:10:05,434
My only vice.

1352
01:10:05,567 --> 01:10:07,934
Well, that's not
strictly true, is it?

1353
01:10:08,434 --> 01:10:10,101
Meaning?

1354
01:10:10,234 --> 01:10:13,700
Meaning I've always taken vice
to be the definition

1355
01:10:13,834 --> 01:10:16,800
of any criminal activity
or wicked behavior

1356
01:10:16,934 --> 01:10:19,700
involving prostitution,
pornography or drugs,

1357
01:10:19,834 --> 01:10:22,101
so, no...

1358
01:10:23,167 --> 01:10:26,468
racing is definitely not
your only vice, your lordship.

1359
01:10:26,600 --> 01:10:29,533
I'd say you're eyebrows deep
in every vice known to man.

1360
01:10:29,667 --> 01:10:31,767
- There is a difference.
- Being?

1361
01:10:32,401 --> 01:10:38,734
I facilitate. I don't participate
in any of the aforementioned vices.

1362
01:10:41,301 --> 01:10:42,401
What about tea?

1363
01:10:51,867 --> 01:10:53,034
[sighs]

1364
01:10:53,167 --> 01:10:54,533
What about tea?

1365
01:10:54,667 --> 01:10:57,800
Well, that too is a vice.

1366
01:10:58,800 --> 01:11:00,667
Caffeine is a drug,
don't you know?

1367
01:11:00,800 --> 01:11:04,633
So is that what you're here
to talk to me about? Tea?

1368
01:11:04,767 --> 01:11:08,567
Sweet Mary Jane is my vice
of choice, as you well know.

1369
01:11:09,001 --> 01:11:12,267
Of course, I'm addicted to
selling it, not consuming it.

1370
01:11:12,633 --> 01:11:15,867
I specifically chose
to deal in marijuana.

1371
01:11:16,301 --> 01:11:18,201
Sure, I could see
there was more to be made

1372
01:11:18,334 --> 01:11:21,934
in shifting the white or the brown
powder, as you so chose,

1373
01:11:22,067 --> 01:11:26,600
but, you see, my jam,
it doesn't kill anyone,

1374
01:11:27,001 --> 01:11:28,700
and I like that.

1375
01:11:31,101 --> 01:11:32,767
<i>While your poison...</i>

1376
01:11:33,934 --> 01:11:38,567
is and always has been
a destroyer of worlds.

1377
01:11:46,767 --> 01:11:51,834
So, yes, your facilitation is
most definitely participation.

1378
01:12:02,001 --> 01:12:05,034
But I'm not here to give you a
sermon on situational ethics.

1379
01:12:05,633 --> 01:12:08,434
So why the fuck
are you here?

1380
01:12:08,567 --> 01:12:09,867
[stomach gurgling]

1381
01:12:12,401 --> 01:12:13,700
[gags]

1382
01:12:15,301 --> 01:12:16,334
[groans]

1383
01:12:25,633 --> 01:12:27,667
You're starting a war
with me, George,

1384
01:12:27,800 --> 01:12:29,500
and I'm trying to moonwalk
with elegance here,

1385
01:12:29,633 --> 01:12:31,533
but I'm finding it
very fucking difficult.

1386
01:12:31,667 --> 01:12:33,201
[Lord Pressfield] Laura!

1387
01:12:33,334 --> 01:12:35,001
[Lord George]
<i>I don't fuck around with puff.</i>

1388
01:12:35,134 --> 01:12:37,167
You send your man Dry Eye
around my place

1389
01:12:37,301 --> 01:12:39,134
to see if he can buy
my business for a few beans.

1390
01:12:39,267 --> 01:12:40,334
Laura!

1391
01:12:42,533 --> 01:12:44,401
[Mickey] <i>You didn't
think I'd find out?</i>

1392
01:12:44,533 --> 01:12:46,401
Having me followed
for months?

1393
01:12:47,667 --> 01:12:49,967
- [Lord George choking]
- Yeah. You crossed the line,

1394
01:12:50,101 --> 01:12:51,667
<i>and that comes
with a price.</i>

1395
01:12:52,267 --> 01:12:54,201
You raided
one of my locations.

1396
01:12:54,934 --> 01:12:56,700
You know the rules,
George.

1397
01:12:57,500 --> 01:12:59,001
What the fuck
were you thinking?

1398
01:12:59,134 --> 01:13:00,967
You raided one of
my locations.

1399
01:13:01,101 --> 01:13:02,967
<i>What the fuck
were you thinking?</i>

1400
01:13:03,334 --> 01:13:05,368
What the fuck
were you thinking, George?

1401
01:13:16,500 --> 01:13:17,533
[exhales]

1402
01:13:19,101 --> 01:13:21,468
[sobbing]

1403
01:13:30,633 --> 01:13:32,134
[breathing heavily]

1404
01:13:32,267 --> 01:13:33,667
[exhales]

1405
01:13:34,600 --> 01:13:37,301
[Lord George chokes, gasps]

1406
01:13:41,600 --> 01:13:44,700
Should you
try and undermine me,

1407
01:13:45,434 --> 01:13:48,167
or should you attempt
to threaten my position again,

1408
01:13:48,301 --> 01:13:50,900
I will be forced to accept
your call to arms.

1409
01:13:51,034 --> 01:13:52,234
Do you understand?

1410
01:13:52,368 --> 01:13:53,900
[breathing heavily]

1411
01:13:54,700 --> 01:13:55,800
Good.

1412
01:13:57,167 --> 01:14:00,834
Now, I can see you're feeling
somewhat under the weather.

1413
01:14:01,334 --> 01:14:03,034
<i>That's because
I spiked your tea</i>

1414
01:14:03,167 --> 01:14:05,967
<i>with a nasty little parasitic
genus called shigella.</i>

1415
01:14:06,800 --> 01:14:10,301
Left unattended, you will shit yourself
to death before the sun doth set.

1416
01:14:12,067 --> 01:14:14,034
I suggest taking
two of these fizzy biscuits.

1417
01:14:16,500 --> 01:14:18,201
You'll be fine
in an hour or two,

1418
01:14:18,800 --> 01:14:21,101
long enough to consider
your past indiscretions.

1419
01:14:27,001 --> 01:14:30,700
And, George, if I can get to
you in your own kitchen...

1420
01:14:32,334 --> 01:14:33,434
I can get to you anywhere.

1421
01:14:41,633 --> 01:14:44,301
- Did you do it?
- Do what?

1422
01:14:44,434 --> 01:14:46,900
Did you raid
Mickey Pearson's farm?

1423
01:14:47,034 --> 01:14:51,134
- No.
- So you're telling me that Phuc did this behind your back.

1424
01:14:52,001 --> 01:14:54,767
Well, let's just say this.
He didn't do it in front of it.

1425
01:14:55,533 --> 01:14:56,633
He did it
without my blessing.

1426
01:14:56,767 --> 01:14:58,334
But you did go behind my back

1427
01:14:58,468 --> 01:15:00,234
and offer to buy his business.

1428
01:15:02,267 --> 01:15:04,900
Yeah. Yeah, I did.

1429
01:15:07,334 --> 01:15:09,567
Now, let me warn you
the way you warn me.

1430
01:15:10,500 --> 01:15:14,368
There comes a point where
the young succeed the old.

1431
01:15:15,468 --> 01:15:16,633
Don't push me.

1432
01:15:21,134 --> 01:15:22,767
There are some things
I don't know about.

1433
01:15:22,900 --> 01:15:26,001
Something between Dry Eye
and Lord George.

1434
01:15:26,134 --> 01:15:31,434
Now, whatever it was,
someone killed Lord George.

1435
01:15:31,900 --> 01:15:36,334
Anyone else might think
that was you or Mickey.

1436
01:15:38,800 --> 01:15:40,934
Shall we continue
with our little story?

1437
01:15:42,600 --> 01:15:44,667
Does that arouse
your interest, Raymond?

1438
01:15:45,301 --> 01:15:46,800
[Raymond]
So Matthew knows Dry Eye.

1439
01:15:48,134 --> 01:15:50,167
- So what?
- Well, yes, I agree.

1440
01:15:50,301 --> 01:15:51,667
Perhaps they were
just meeting up

1441
01:15:51,800 --> 01:15:53,401
to talk about holidaying
in the Maldives

1442
01:15:53,533 --> 01:15:57,368
or the long-term implications
of leaving the EU.

1443
01:15:57,500 --> 01:16:02,368
But I filmed it, had it lip-read,
translated and transcribed.

1444
01:16:02,500 --> 01:16:05,468
Rather like the classic
1974 film <i>The Conversation,</i>

1445
01:16:05,600 --> 01:16:07,967
starring Gene Hackman
and John Cazale.

1446
01:16:08,101 --> 01:16:11,401
You know, Coppola slipped that
one out between the <i>Godfathers.</i>

1447
01:16:11,967 --> 01:16:14,301
It wasn't really for me.
It's a bit boring, to be honest.

1448
01:16:14,434 --> 01:16:19,434
Now, can I just say, that Matthew,
he's quite something, isn't he?

1449
01:16:19,567 --> 01:16:21,533
He's not
your average American.

1450
01:16:21,667 --> 01:16:24,967
He's a Mr. International.
Even speaks a bit of Cantonese.

1451
01:16:25,101 --> 01:16:30,468
Come here. You play Dry Eye
and I shall be Matthew.

1452
01:16:32,067 --> 01:16:33,267
Come on.

1453
01:16:37,934 --> 01:16:40,700
All right. [sighs]

1454
01:16:41,934 --> 01:16:43,600
Try and get it in time
with his lips, all right?

1455
01:16:43,734 --> 01:16:45,334
- Yeah, yeah.
- Ready?

1456
01:16:46,434 --> 01:16:47,633
Roll camera. Action.

1457
01:16:47,767 --> 01:16:49,633
[crowd cheering]

1458
01:16:56,134 --> 01:16:58,301
[camera beeps, clicks]

1459
01:16:58,434 --> 01:17:00,834
[muffled chattering]

1460
01:17:00,967 --> 01:17:03,334
[Raymond] <i>There was an incident.
Lord George...</i>

1461
01:17:03,468 --> 01:17:04,567
[Fletcher]
<i>Fuck's sake, Raymond.</i>

1462
01:17:04,700 --> 01:17:06,234
It's a bit fucking wooden.

1463
01:17:06,368 --> 01:17:08,234
Put something into it,
you know, a bit of welly.

1464
01:17:08,767 --> 01:17:10,201
And action.

1465
01:17:10,334 --> 01:17:11,700
There was an incident.

1466
01:17:11,834 --> 01:17:13,500
Lord George
didn't come through it.

1467
01:17:13,633 --> 01:17:15,201
Didn't come through it?

1468
01:17:15,334 --> 01:17:17,700
The last thing you need to do
is attract any octopus.

1469
01:17:17,834 --> 01:17:19,134
Octopus?

1470
01:17:20,401 --> 01:17:23,167
What does that mean?
It's not a very good translation.

1471
01:17:23,301 --> 01:17:24,867
No, there's nothing wrong
with the translation.

1472
01:17:25,001 --> 01:17:26,667
Matthew's not that fluent.
And it's Cantonese.

1473
01:17:26,800 --> 01:17:28,334
Just go with it
and fill in the blanks.

1474
01:17:28,468 --> 01:17:29,800
And action.

1475
01:17:30,434 --> 01:17:32,500
[Raymond] <i>It's all on Michael.
He's to blame.</i>

1476
01:17:33,267 --> 01:17:34,667
[Fletcher]
<i>That is not a smart move.</i>

1477
01:17:34,800 --> 01:17:36,767
Don't tell me
what a smart move is.

1478
01:17:36,900 --> 01:17:38,034
[Fletcher]
<i>I beg for your pardon.</i>

1479
01:17:38,167 --> 01:17:39,867
You heard me
perfectly well.

1480
01:17:40,001 --> 01:17:42,533
<i>There will be repercussions
for Michael's actions.</i>

1481
01:17:42,667 --> 01:17:44,301
You think you're
running things, do you?

1482
01:17:44,800 --> 01:17:46,700
<i>Don't stroke my mouse hair.</i>

1483
01:17:47,967 --> 01:17:51,067
- What does "mouse hair" mean?
- Yeah, I think what he means is don't jeopardize my deal,

1484
01:17:51,201 --> 01:17:53,034
but I admit that one's
a bit of a googly.

1485
01:17:53,167 --> 01:17:54,834
Then Matthew loses it a bit

1486
01:17:54,967 --> 01:17:57,301
and his translation goes
completely out of the window.

1487
01:17:57,434 --> 01:18:00,234
Something about springtime
and sweaters.

1488
01:18:00,368 --> 01:18:01,867
I think what he means
is he's upset.

1489
01:18:02,001 --> 01:18:03,368
<i>And then Dry Eye
says something,</i>

1490
01:18:03,500 --> 01:18:05,001
<i>but some cunt
moved in front of me,</i>

1491
01:18:05,134 --> 01:18:06,468
<i>so I didn't get that
either.</i>

1492
01:18:06,600 --> 01:18:08,667
Your Cantonese
is dog shit,

1493
01:18:08,800 --> 01:18:09,867
so I'm gonna say this
in English

1494
01:18:10,001 --> 01:18:11,034
and I'm gonna say it once,

1495
01:18:11,167 --> 01:18:12,867
so listen to me,
Rubenstein.

1496
01:18:15,434 --> 01:18:17,167
This is how
it's gonna play out.

1497
01:18:18,533 --> 01:18:20,201
You're gonna
back the fuck off...

1498
01:18:21,167 --> 01:18:22,867
and I'm gonna
take it all.

1499
01:18:24,167 --> 01:18:26,900
And you will pay me
my respect.

1500
01:18:28,001 --> 01:18:30,234
[Fletcher] And there you have it.
That's all I've got.

1501
01:18:30,368 --> 01:18:33,201
Sorry. Show's over.

1502
01:18:33,334 --> 01:18:36,001
But I think
it's quite clear

1503
01:18:36,134 --> 01:18:38,567
that they're not just
mah-jongg partners, are they?

1504
01:18:39,134 --> 01:18:40,201
Mm?

1505
01:18:47,767 --> 01:18:50,201
Not all of that
was clear, Fletcher.

1506
01:18:50,334 --> 01:18:51,967
I mean,
according to you,

1507
01:18:52,101 --> 01:18:54,434
we already know Matthew
wants to buy Michael out.

1508
01:18:55,468 --> 01:18:58,934
- So why is that news?
- Oh, don't you worry, my darling.

1509
01:18:59,067 --> 01:19:00,867
We are gonna
come to the news.

1510
01:19:01,567 --> 01:19:04,267
<i>I'm approaching my climax.</i>

1511
01:19:05,234 --> 01:19:07,600
[chattering]

1512
01:19:10,967 --> 01:19:12,267
Dry Eye.

1513
01:19:12,800 --> 01:19:16,101
I trust you will make
Michael Pearson pay for this.

1514
01:19:16,967 --> 01:19:18,934
You are
the dragon head now.

1515
01:19:19,067 --> 01:19:20,834
Solidify your position.

1516
01:19:22,301 --> 01:19:23,633
It will be done, Uncle.

1517
01:19:24,734 --> 01:19:27,600
[Fletcher] <i>So Dry Eye got the upgrade
he was after, didn't he, Raymond?</i>

1518
01:19:27,734 --> 01:19:30,167
<i>The question is,
what was he gonna do with it</i>

1519
01:19:30,301 --> 01:19:32,301
<i>now that he's
Billy Big Bollocks?</i>

1520
01:19:32,434 --> 01:19:34,034
Give me ten minutes,
Ray.

1521
01:19:35,167 --> 01:19:36,201
Boss.

["Cumberland Gap"

1523
01:19:50,101 --> 01:19:51,434
Hello, Ros.

1524
01:19:51,567 --> 01:19:53,567
It's date night tonight,

1525
01:19:53,700 --> 01:19:56,468
9:00 p.m., you and I,
River Cafe.

1526
01:19:56,600 --> 01:19:58,867
Nine o'clock? I'll be there.

01:19:59,401 --> 01:20:00,567
[door opens]

1528
01:20:02,667 --> 01:20:04,234
We're closed.

1529
01:20:04,368 --> 01:20:05,500
[man] Hang up.

1530
01:20:07,334 --> 01:20:08,368
No.

1531
01:20:08,934 --> 01:20:10,034
[man]
<i>Hang the fucking phone up.</i>

1532
01:20:10,167 --> 01:20:11,201
Who's there?

1533
01:20:13,167 --> 01:20:14,700
Ros, who's there?

1534
01:20:15,034 --> 01:20:16,201
<i>What you doing here,
Dry Eye?</i>

[chuckles]

1538
01:20:20,201 --> 01:20:22,034
It's warming up now,
isn't it?

1539
01:20:22,167 --> 01:20:25,867
At this point, I'm guessing
that you didn't even know

1540
01:20:26,001 --> 01:20:28,034
that Lord George
was dead yet,

1541
01:20:28,167 --> 01:20:30,533
let alone
what Dry Eye was up to.

1542
01:20:30,667 --> 01:20:33,134
Hello, Dry Eye.
What do you want?

1543
01:20:33,934 --> 01:20:34,967
[phone beeps]

1544
01:20:36,567 --> 01:20:37,967

1545
01:20:45,533 --> 01:20:46,633
Fancy a boiled sweet?

1546
01:20:47,301 --> 01:20:49,834
- No.
- Suit yourself.

1547
01:20:58,134 --> 01:20:59,468
Who the fuck was he?

[Fletcher] <i>I'm not exactly

to give me the slip.</i>

01:21:04,468 --> 01:21:06,500
They got Rosalind.
Call Roger.

1551
01:21:08,167 --> 01:21:10,368
Oh, goody. Another bottle.
[chuckles]

1552
01:21:10,500 --> 01:21:12,633
Hold on. You were there?

1553
01:21:12,767 --> 01:21:14,867
[camera shutter clicking]

1554
01:21:15,334 --> 01:21:17,368
Yeah.
Of course I was there.

1555
01:21:18,101 --> 01:21:21,468
He's not picking up. Maybe you
should put your seat belt on.

1556
01:21:22,633 --> 01:21:24,633
Yeah, let me call Rosalind.
Let me do it.

1557
01:21:24,934 --> 01:21:26,001
[car horn honks]

1558
01:21:26,134 --> 01:21:28,301
I got it.
Just watch the road.

1559
01:21:29,134 --> 01:21:30,967
- [phone ringing]
- Now, Rosalind, don't be alarmed,

1560
01:21:31,101 --> 01:21:32,800
but you're gonna
come with me

1561
01:21:32,934 --> 01:21:35,167
until I can resolve all these
issues with your husband.

1562
01:21:35,934 --> 01:21:37,334
I'm not going anywhere.

1563
01:21:38,134 --> 01:21:40,001
She's not picking up.
It's just ringing.

1564
01:21:40,134 --> 01:21:42,934
- Fuck.
- We could just slow down a little bit.

1565
01:21:44,767 --> 01:21:46,134
Fuck!

1566
01:21:54,134 --> 01:21:55,167
[gasps]

1567
01:22:00,834 --> 01:22:02,468
[Dry Eye]
<i>You know how it works.</i>

1568
01:22:03,167 --> 01:22:06,667
You either come with me or Tony
here is gonna make you come with me.

1569
01:22:06,800 --> 01:22:09,500
You're in my office
under my roof.

1570
01:22:09,633 --> 01:22:11,401
It's not your position
for Tony to do anything

1571
01:22:11,533 --> 01:22:13,867
other than to fuck off back
from whence he came.

1572
01:22:14,001 --> 01:22:15,633
- [Tony chuckles]
- Tony.

1573
01:22:17,800 --> 01:22:20,201
What's that?
Is that a paperweight?

1574
01:22:20,334 --> 01:22:23,834
Funny you should say that. Turns out
anything with weight can be a paperweight.

1575
01:22:23,967 --> 01:22:26,134
- What are you gonna do with it?
- Well, that's up to you, isn't it?

1576
01:22:26,267 --> 01:22:28,633
Either you do as I tell
you to and use the door,

1577
01:22:28,767 --> 01:22:31,167
or I'm gonna shoot fat Tony
right between the eyes.

1578
01:22:31,301 --> 01:22:33,301
You see, this gun's
only got two bullets,

1579
01:22:33,434 --> 01:22:35,867
so I'm not gonna fuck about
illustrating its significance.

1580
01:22:36,001 --> 01:22:37,734
You're gonna have to
trust me on that.

1581
01:22:37,867 --> 01:22:39,667
The alternative
is a little bit absolute.

1582
01:22:40,934 --> 01:22:42,834
I'm gonna have
to check your grammar on that.

1583
01:22:43,301 --> 01:22:45,468
It can't be
just a little bit absolute.

1584
01:22:45,600 --> 01:22:48,067
It either is or it isn't.

1585
01:22:48,201 --> 01:22:51,301
Whatever it is,
I've lost my patience.

1586
01:22:51,434 --> 01:22:55,301
I'm telling you, I will squeeze this
trigger and Tony will be no more.

1587
01:22:55,434 --> 01:22:57,301
- Tony.
- [Tony exhales]

1588
01:22:58,667 --> 01:23:01,201
Listen to me, cunt.
You take one step forward,

1589
01:23:01,334 --> 01:23:03,167
it'll be the last fucking
step you ever take.

1590
01:23:03,301 --> 01:23:04,667
Tony, get on it.

1591
01:23:05,567 --> 01:23:06,600
[gasps]

1592
01:23:23,434 --> 01:23:24,767

[panting]

1594
01:23:39,967 --> 01:23:41,368
I fucking dare you.

1595
01:23:44,067 --> 01:23:45,167
Just calm down.

1596
01:23:46,267 --> 01:23:47,301
I'm leaving.

1597
01:23:54,967 --> 01:23:56,434
I guess that's
your two bullets, eh?

1598
01:23:57,401 --> 01:23:58,700
Rosalind!

1599
01:23:59,001 --> 01:24:00,001

01:24:12,633 --> 01:24:14,001
Rosalind!

[Dry Eye grunts]

1603
01:24:20,500 --> 01:24:22,201
Stay fucking still!

1604
01:24:29,468 --> 01:24:30,401
Hello, babe.

01:24:47,267 --> 01:24:48,334
Hello, love.

1610
01:24:49,001 --> 01:24:51,234
[Raymond] <i>So you're
basing your whole crescendo</i>

1611
01:24:51,767 --> 01:24:53,401
on a figment
of your imagination.

1612
01:24:53,533 --> 01:24:57,301
I'm basing my whole crescendo
on the sum of its parts.

1613
01:24:57,434 --> 01:24:59,667
A few minor details aside,
I wouldn't have any trouble at all

1614
01:24:59,800 --> 01:25:03,767
selling this juicy peach
of a drama to Big Dave.

1615
01:25:03,900 --> 01:25:05,800
He'd cream
his fucking panties.

1616
01:25:05,934 --> 01:25:08,600
You're too smart to be
blackmailing us, Fletcher.

1617
01:25:08,734 --> 01:25:11,434
Yes, yes, and obviously I've
taken precautionary measures.

1618
01:25:11,734 --> 01:25:15,134
[chuckles] You can do all kinds of
horrible things to me if you want.

1619
01:25:15,633 --> 01:25:17,434
I might even enjoy them.

1620
01:25:17,567 --> 01:25:20,167
But you'd have to leave the
country and never come back.

1621
01:25:20,301 --> 01:25:22,267
So is that the story over
now, Fletcher?

1622
01:25:22,401 --> 01:25:26,101
All this, this whole buildup,
was leading to this next part.

1623
01:25:26,234 --> 01:25:29,468
This is the news that
you were asking about before.

1624
01:25:29,600 --> 01:25:31,034
Ready?

1625
01:25:31,633 --> 01:25:32,667
Matthew.

1626
01:25:33,500 --> 01:25:35,301
<i>He's gonna need some people
to run his business here</i>

1627
01:25:35,434 --> 01:25:37,334
<i>when he buys it
from Michael, right?</i>

1628
01:25:37,468 --> 01:25:40,267
He's gonna need a reliable pair of
hands, someone like you.

1629
01:25:40,401 --> 01:25:42,368
Hmm. So why didn't he
ask you, Raymond?

1630
01:25:42,500 --> 01:25:44,867
I don't know.
It's none of my business.

1631
01:25:45,001 --> 01:25:46,533
Because, I'll tell you,

1632
01:25:47,167 --> 01:25:49,667
he already had someone
earmarked for the role.

1633
01:25:50,468 --> 01:25:53,600
<i>Dry Eye.
He promised Dry Eye the job,</i>

1634
01:25:53,734 --> 01:25:57,500
but only if Dry Eye helped drive
down the price of Mickey's business.

1635
01:25:57,633 --> 01:26:02,001
You see, it was Matthew who told Dry
Eye the location of Mickey's farm,

1636
01:26:02,134 --> 01:26:04,500
<i>so he could steal
his white widow super cheese</i>

1637
01:26:04,633 --> 01:26:06,900
to cause ripples
and reduce the market value.

1638
01:26:07,034 --> 01:26:09,700
And that is why Phuc,
in turn,

1639
01:26:09,834 --> 01:26:14,067
<i>got those juice-swilling,
acne-backed muscle Marys to do the job.</i>

1640
01:26:14,201 --> 01:26:16,067
<i>It was Matthew</i>

1641
01:26:16,201 --> 01:26:18,967
who set this whole
train of events off.

1642
01:26:19,767 --> 01:26:22,034
<i>But what he did not
plan on, you see...</i>

1643
01:26:22,167 --> 01:26:23,867
Fuck you,
you old cunt!

1644
01:26:24,001 --> 01:26:25,301
I'll piss on your grave.

1645
01:26:27,967 --> 01:26:29,567
<i>...was Dry Eye...</i>

1646
01:26:31,468 --> 01:26:32,700
killing Lord George.

1647
01:26:34,167 --> 01:26:37,800
<i>Now, Dry Eye does not want to be
subservient to Matthew anymore.</i>

1648
01:26:37,934 --> 01:26:39,334
Doesn't wanna be
subservient to anyone.

1649
01:26:39,468 --> 01:26:41,234
This is how
it's gonna play out.

1650
01:26:41,368 --> 01:26:42,633
[crowd cheering,
applauding]

1651
01:26:42,767 --> 01:26:44,567
You're gonna
back the fuck off

1652
01:26:45,101 --> 01:26:47,067
and I'm gonna
take it all.

1653
01:26:47,201 --> 01:26:50,900
Dry Eye likes the smell of
power and does not like Matthew.

1654
01:26:51,034 --> 01:26:55,401
<i>So, the little dragon needed a gentle
reminder of who was really running things.</i>

1655
01:26:55,533 --> 01:26:57,567
You've been in this paddling
pool for two minutes.

1656
01:26:57,700 --> 01:27:00,533
I've been swimming in the ocean
with the sharks for 20 years.

1657
01:27:00,667 --> 01:27:03,234
I'll tell you
how this plays out.

1658
01:27:03,967 --> 01:27:05,468
You will drown...

1659
01:27:06,600 --> 01:27:09,334
and then my Mossad crabs
will eat you.

1660
01:27:09,468 --> 01:27:14,334
And this, my love, is why I want
my hard-earned 20 million pounds.

1661
01:27:14,468 --> 01:27:20,500
Because not only do I know exactly
how Mickey's business operates,

1662
01:27:20,633 --> 01:27:24,934
but I also know that the very
man he's trying to sell it to

1663
01:27:25,067 --> 01:27:27,700
is trying to force him
into selling it on the cheap

1664
01:27:27,834 --> 01:27:30,767
and has indirectly
started a war.

1665
01:27:31,468 --> 01:27:34,800
So, you see, I think you should be
calling me your trusted consigliere,

1666
01:27:35,767 --> 01:27:37,301
or your spy
behind the lines,

1667
01:27:37,434 --> 01:27:41,434
your intellectual
reconnaissance, if you prefer.

1668
01:27:42,934 --> 01:27:44,334
I'm impressed.

1669
01:27:45,567 --> 01:27:47,767
You certainly know
more than I do.

1670
01:27:47,900 --> 01:27:50,633
I'm impressed not only
by your information,

1671
01:27:50,767 --> 01:27:52,867
but by your imagination.

1672
01:27:53,633 --> 01:27:54,867
Thank you very much.

1673
01:27:57,468 --> 01:27:59,267
So you've got 72 hours.

1674
01:28:00,301 --> 01:28:03,500
And I would just reiterate
that if anything happens to me,

1675
01:28:03,633 --> 01:28:05,967
I do have my insurance policy
in place.

1676
01:28:06,434 --> 01:28:09,201
Everything will go to Big Dave,
and from him to the public,

1677
01:28:09,334 --> 01:28:11,301
and you, my love,
will go to Mars.

1678
01:28:11,434 --> 01:28:14,500
So, strong recommendation,
just pay up

1679
01:28:14,633 --> 01:28:20,167
and watch me recede into the
sunset blowing kisses, yes?

1680
01:28:23,201 --> 01:28:27,368
Well, then, time to use the
door, you black bastard.

1681
01:28:27,500 --> 01:28:29,834
Well, that's just silly, isn't
it, 'cause I'm not black.

1682
01:28:29,967 --> 01:28:32,834
No, but your fucking soul is,
you dark cunt.

1683
01:28:35,034 --> 01:28:38,134
Now, out of my house,
'cause I'm going to bed.

1684
01:28:40,633 --> 01:28:42,134
Can I come with you?

1685
01:28:43,500 --> 01:28:47,533
No, but you can go smoke the exhaust
pipe in the back of your hearse.

1686
01:28:49,201 --> 01:28:50,633
I might come anyway.

1687
01:28:52,201 --> 01:28:54,834
You'll just hear me
scratching about in the dark,

1688

1689
01:29:02,500 --> 01:29:05,034
All right, so, 20 million.

Now, you keep this
between you and me, Hammy,

1702
01:29:47,468 --> 01:29:50,034
but Fletcher's been in touch.
He says he's got what we need.

1703
01:29:50,167 --> 01:29:52,633
Careful, boss. Fletcher's ass
belongs to the highest bidder.

1704
01:29:52,767 --> 01:29:54,633
Yeah.
He says he wants 150 grand.

1705
01:29:54,767 --> 01:29:57,134
But if it's proper, it's worth
a whole week's exclusive.

Well, what does he
have exactly?

tickling me nuts,

he wants to meet Saturday.

Now, it seems for
this brief moment in time

1749
01:32:04,800 --> 01:32:07,001
I've found my way
into the film business,

1750
01:32:07,134 --> 01:32:11,834
and last night I made a film with
an impressively sized farmyard pig.

1751
01:32:15,834 --> 01:32:18,301
Morning, sir.
Two cups of tea.

1752

One with sugar, one without.

1753
01:32:21,101 --> 01:32:23,067
All right, lads,
go on, give us a minute.

[snorting]

1755
01:32:25,934 --> 01:32:27,867
[Coach] There are some wet
wipes there over your shoulder.

Your clothes are neatly folded
there on the bench.

1757

Now, in due course, you're gonna
press the space bar on this computer

and you're gonna witness your
participation in said film.

1759
01:32:37,934 --> 01:32:41,334
Now, that little drug we
gave you last night really...

1760
01:32:43,001 --> 01:32:44,734

your inhibitions, man.

from becoming

1763
01:32:51,700 --> 01:32:54,533

in the future of Mickey Pearson.

to clean yourself up.

Michael.

- The market's changed.
- How so?

1810
01:35:12,700 --> 01:35:16,301
The exit value of your business
needs to be recalculated.

1811
01:35:17,034 --> 01:35:18,967
Please, be specific.

1812
01:35:19,101 --> 01:35:21,001
Oh, I will be.

1813
01:35:21,134 --> 01:35:24,468
You're asking 400 for 12 locations
and a distribution network,

1814
01:35:24,600 --> 01:35:27,067
which was a fair valuation
at the time.

1815
01:35:27,201 --> 01:35:30,001
But when one of those
locations was compromised,

1816
01:35:30,134 --> 01:35:32,468
the value of all those
locations were compromised

1817
01:35:32,600 --> 01:35:34,301
and this obviously
affects the price.

1818
01:35:35,134 --> 01:35:38,767
Your skunk farm was a fucking viral
sensation on YouTube, Michael.

1819
01:35:38,900 --> 01:35:41,368
And when Johnny Law starts
sniffing, which he will,

1820
01:35:41,500 --> 01:35:43,600
all of those locations
will have to cease production

1821
01:35:43,734 --> 01:35:47,500
for, I'd say, at least 12 months
at a cost of 100 million net p.a.,

1822

staff, relocation and site rentals.

- Yes, I'm following.

1824
01:35:52,401 --> 01:35:54,533
It will take
at least three years

1825
01:35:54,667 --> 01:35:58,134
to get your supply, distribution
and demand back to full capacity.

1826
01:35:58,267 --> 01:36:02,001
Your staffing costs are 25% of
your 100 million operational cost,

1827
01:36:02,134 --> 01:36:05,700
so that's 25 million per annum
for three annums.

1828
01:36:05,834 --> 01:36:08,167
And location rental
at 15 million a year,

1829
01:36:08,301 --> 01:36:12,334
that's a 120 GBP bite
right there.

1830
01:36:12,468 --> 01:36:15,034
Your unit economics
have taken a hit,

1831
01:36:15,167 --> 01:36:19,700
and forecasting out your top-line growth
margin in the current inimical climate,

1832
01:36:19,834 --> 01:36:23,101
I calculate what was worth
400 million a month ago

1833
01:36:23,234 --> 01:36:27,700
must now be valued
at an anemic, mm... 130.

1834
01:36:28,934 --> 01:36:32,667
You see, it's not about the
first domino that fell, Michael.

1835
01:36:33,500 --> 01:36:34,667
It's about the last.

1836
01:36:37,001 --> 01:36:38,067
Please.

1837
01:36:41,600 --> 01:36:44,334
I like you, Michael.
You're a good chap.

1838
01:36:45,134 --> 01:36:48,834
And if you want me to help you out of
this hole you've found yourself in,

1839
01:36:49,468 --> 01:36:52,500
I can pay you
100 million dollars today.

1840
01:36:53,500 --> 01:36:55,967
It's a good offer
and it's real,

1841
01:36:56,101 --> 01:36:58,234
and I'll do this
because I'm your friend.

1842
01:36:58,368 --> 01:37:01,468
My accountant can transfer
the fee within the hour.

1843
01:37:02,368 --> 01:37:04,401
I like your domino analogy.

1844
01:37:06,134 --> 01:37:10,167
The question I ask is,
who tumbled the first domino?

1845
01:37:10,800 --> 01:37:13,900
I'm afraid that's not my
concern or my business, Michael.

1846
01:37:14,034 --> 01:37:15,867
At the risk
of contradicting you,

1847
01:37:16,001 --> 01:37:19,967
it is very much your business,
and certainly your concern.

1848
01:37:21,434 --> 01:37:22,900
Only you made one mistake.

1849
01:37:24,267 --> 01:37:25,401
That being?

1850
01:37:26,001 --> 01:37:28,967
You seem to have mistaken me
for some kind of a cunt.

1851
01:37:30,800 --> 01:37:33,201
Let me introduce you
to the first domino.

1852
01:37:37,267 --> 01:37:41,934
It's a tad dramatic, isn't it,
corpses in freezers? Who is this man?

1853
01:37:42,067 --> 01:37:44,101
What's he got to do with
anything that I'm talking about?

1854
01:37:44,234 --> 01:37:46,834
I take it with that statement
you are in denial

1855
01:37:46,967 --> 01:37:49,533
of so-said relationship
with this frozen Chinaman?

1856
01:37:49,667 --> 01:37:51,834
Well, of course
I'm in denial of it.

1857
01:37:51,967 --> 01:37:55,633
I don't have relationships
with dead, frozen Chinamen.

1858
01:37:55,767 --> 01:37:59,334
Best not to be glib at this time
in the proceedings, Matthew.

1859
01:38:03,067 --> 01:38:05,301
Don't bother looking
for your Mossad crabs.

1860
01:38:05,434 --> 01:38:07,867
This is a fish market.
They have found a home.

1861
01:38:08,401 --> 01:38:10,934
To be clear,
I do not know that man.

1862
01:38:13,234 --> 01:38:15,034
<i>I'll tell you
how this plays out.</i>

1863
01:38:15,633 --> 01:38:20,201
<i>You will drown and then
my Mossad crabs will eat you.</i>

1864
01:38:20,334 --> 01:38:23,633
So while you were discussing
who would take over my business

1865
01:38:23,767 --> 01:38:25,267
after you fucked it,

1866
01:38:26,234 --> 01:38:29,301
you somehow mistook so-said
Chinaman for someone else?

1867
01:38:30,967 --> 01:38:35,001
Business is business, Michael.
It's nothing personal.

1868
01:38:35,134 --> 01:38:37,468
While I am not emotional
about the money,

1869
01:38:37,600 --> 01:38:41,368
there is a price indebted to me for
the blood I've gotten on my hands

1870
01:38:41,500 --> 01:38:44,900
restoring order to the
untidiness that you created,

1871
01:38:45,034 --> 01:38:46,667
and that price,
according to you...

1872
01:38:46,800 --> 01:38:50,834
400 minus 130...
is 270 million dollars.

1873
01:38:50,967 --> 01:38:54,034
And I'm keeping
the business,

1874
01:38:55,334 --> 01:38:58,468
while you are
getting in the freezer.

1875
01:38:59,134 --> 01:39:02,234
And you will make that transaction if
you want to get out of the freezer.

1876
01:39:02,368 --> 01:39:06,834
It is 25 below zero in there,
so I assume you'll last about an hour.

1877
01:39:06,967 --> 01:39:08,734
That said,
I wouldn't fuck about,

1878
01:39:08,867 --> 01:39:11,034
because frostbite is very
expensive on the fingers and toes,

1879
01:39:11,167 --> 01:39:13,310
so I would type as quickly as possible
while you have the use of them.

1880
01:39:13,325 --> 01:39:15,425
- Uh...
- After you've attended to that indiscretion,

1881
01:39:15,559 --> 01:39:19,425
you can then deal with the next
consequence of your shortsightedness.

1882
01:39:19,993 --> 01:39:23,959
As stated,
I am not emotional about the money.

1883
01:39:26,659 --> 01:39:30,325
But I am emotional about the fact that
someone laid their hands on my wife.

1884
01:39:31,225 --> 01:39:33,525
[panting]

1885
01:39:33,659 --> 01:39:34,926
My wife!

1886
01:39:37,525 --> 01:39:40,959
No amount of money on God's green earth
can pay for that transgression, Matthew.

1887
01:39:41,093 --> 01:39:42,659
No, for that...

1888
01:39:46,525 --> 01:39:47,759
I want a pound of flesh.

1889
01:39:48,926 --> 01:39:49,993
A pound of flesh?

1890
01:39:50,125 --> 01:39:51,659
It matters not to me

1891
01:39:51,792 --> 01:39:53,792
where on your anatomy
it is withdrawn from.

1892
01:39:54,726 --> 01:39:57,926
If you don't have the stomach
to take it for yourself,

1893
01:39:58,059 --> 01:40:00,158
big Bunny here
is very adept with a knife,

1894
01:40:00,292 --> 01:40:02,125
and, as you can see,
he's dressed for the weather.

1895
01:40:02,258 --> 01:40:06,559
But a penny short
or a gram shy...

1896
01:40:07,959 --> 01:40:10,392
and that freezer door
does not open.

1897
01:40:10,525 --> 01:40:11,559
Am I clear?

1898
01:40:12,692 --> 01:40:13,726
Good.

1899
01:40:14,792 --> 01:40:16,459
- Bunny.
- [Bunny] Incoming.

1900
01:40:26,726 --> 01:40:29,093
- [sizzles]
- [Fletcher chuckles]

1901
01:40:29,225 --> 01:40:31,626
What, is it Wagyu again
for breakfast, Raymond?

1902
01:40:33,959 --> 01:40:37,626
Aren't you gonna introduce me to your
mysterious and slightly menacing friend?

1903
01:40:42,993 --> 01:40:45,093
What's that for?
Is that for my money?

1904
01:40:45,592 --> 01:40:47,093
[chuckles]

1905
01:40:47,559 --> 01:40:48,692
Where's my money, Raymond?

1906
01:40:48,826 --> 01:40:50,292
There's your payment.

1907
01:40:54,093 --> 01:40:55,592
Go on, take a look.

1908
01:40:55,726 --> 01:40:57,592
Thank you,
mysterious stranger.

1909
01:41:07,726 --> 01:41:10,258
Well, that's disappointing, 'cause that
doesn't look like 20 million pounds.

1910
01:41:10,392 --> 01:41:13,425
It's more interesting than that,
your insurance policy,

1911
01:41:13,559 --> 01:41:16,959
all the photos, all the bodies,
all the skeletons, all the filth.

1912
01:41:17,093 --> 01:41:21,325
It's not the only one,
darling. I'm not a mong.

1913
01:41:21,459 --> 01:41:23,759
What do you think's in that,
you fucking eejit?

1914
01:41:24,626 --> 01:41:26,759
[Raymond] Of course we were
aware of what Matthew was up to.

1915
01:41:26,892 --> 01:41:28,626
We're not complete
fucking idiots.

1916
01:41:28,759 --> 01:41:30,692
[sizzles]

1917
01:41:30,826 --> 01:41:33,592
I've been onto you
for a long time, Fletcher.

1918
01:41:34,559 --> 01:41:36,626
- I knew you'd been following Michael.
- [camera shutter clicks]

1919
01:41:36,759 --> 01:41:38,392
<i>They're very similar,
our jobs.</i>

1920
01:41:38,959 --> 01:41:41,192
<i>Only I'm better at it
than you are.</i>

1921
01:41:42,892 --> 01:41:46,459
I knew when you came over that night that
you'd only be there for half an hour...

1922
01:41:47,325 --> 01:41:49,258
<i>Buenas tardes, Raymondo.</i>

1923
01:41:49,392 --> 01:41:52,459
...to tell me how clever you
are and try to blackmail us.

1924
01:41:53,192 --> 01:41:55,459
I've got some very important
information to impart to you, Raymond.

1925
01:41:55,592 --> 01:41:59,093
I also knew you couldn't
resist a £1500 single malt,

1926
01:41:59,225 --> 01:42:02,626
an £80 Wagyu steak and a
state-of-the-art smokeless barbie

1927
01:42:03,192 --> 01:42:05,826
- that even keeps your feet warm.
- I love a barbie.

1928
01:42:05,959 --> 01:42:08,826
I promise you, you will regret
this if you don't hear it.

1929
01:42:08,959 --> 01:42:11,592
And when the Scotch
got into your cold veins,

1930
01:42:11,726 --> 01:42:14,425
you lost the benefit
of your sharp instincts.

1931
01:42:14,892 --> 01:42:17,125
Oh, goody. Another bottle.
[chuckles]

1932
01:42:17,258 --> 01:42:19,792
Can you tell the mysterious
gentleman to relax?

1933
01:42:19,926 --> 01:42:22,959
Because I promise you, you will regret it
if you don't hear this. Sit down, my love.

1934
01:42:23,093 --> 01:42:26,492
See, I kept you there 'cause I needed
to know about Matthew and Dry Eye.

1935
01:42:27,692 --> 01:42:30,726
<i>Took us a while to find
your insurance policies.</i>

1936
01:42:32,392 --> 01:42:34,425
<i>'Cause you're
a naughty squirrel, Fletcher.</i>

1937
01:42:35,359 --> 01:42:37,492
Fletcher, shoes off inside.

1938
01:42:37,626 --> 01:42:38,926
Yes, Mommy.

1939
01:42:39,959 --> 01:42:43,292
<i>But it was made a lot easier after
I planted a tracker in your shoe.</i>

1940
01:42:47,759 --> 01:42:49,959
<i>You're never gonna be
a predator with us, Fletcher.</i>

1941
01:42:51,826 --> 01:42:53,659
You're always
gonna be prey.

1942
01:42:54,892 --> 01:42:58,258
So that's it. Three strikes.
We're good, right?

1943
01:43:00,959 --> 01:43:04,093
- I'll see you around.
- With the greatest respect, I hope not.

1944
01:43:10,425 --> 01:43:14,826
[sighs] Now, Fletcher,
what were you saying?

1945
01:43:15,559 --> 01:43:18,125
[Fletcher, muffled] It wasn't
Lord George that was after Mickey,

1946
01:43:18,258 --> 01:43:20,692
or Dry Eye, or Matthew.

1947
01:43:21,826 --> 01:43:23,158
Do you wanna know who it was?

1948
01:43:27,792 --> 01:43:28,993
I've got photos.

1949
01:43:31,726 --> 01:43:33,592
Right.
You've got 30 seconds.

1950
01:43:33,726 --> 01:43:34,759
Thank you, darling.

1951
01:43:36,792 --> 01:43:38,626
- [phone vibrating]
- Fuck.

1952
01:43:40,392 --> 01:43:41,826
Primetime,
what is it, son?

1953
01:43:41,959 --> 01:43:44,759
Coach, we're gonna take
care of this for you.

1954
01:43:44,892 --> 01:43:46,258
Ernie's got a plan.

1955
01:43:46,525 --> 01:43:48,225
What the fuck
are you talking about?

1956
01:43:48,359 --> 01:43:51,592
The Michael situation.
We're gonna sort it.

1957
01:43:51,726 --> 01:43:53,093
[cocks gun]

1958
01:43:53,359 --> 01:43:54,959
- Primetime, listen... Prime...
- [phone beeps]

1959
01:43:56,425 --> 01:43:57,392
Jesus.

1960
01:43:57,525 --> 01:43:59,125
[gate clinks]

1961
01:44:08,525 --> 01:44:10,292
[Fletcher] <i>Now, you
remember Aslan, don't you?</i>

1962
01:44:10,926 --> 01:44:13,425
The young gentleman
you kept in the freezer?

1963
01:44:15,892 --> 01:44:20,425
Well, this is Aslan Senior,
Russian oligarch.

1964
01:44:21,926 --> 01:44:24,125
<i>Ex-KGB. Made all
his money in gas pipes.</i>

1965
01:44:24,258 --> 01:44:27,459
And he's extremely sad that his
one-and-only son fell out of a window.

1966
01:44:27,926 --> 01:44:29,425
[boy] Oh, shit.

1967
01:44:29,726 --> 01:44:31,626
And I fear that where
they failed before, Raymond,

1968
01:44:31,759 --> 01:44:33,959
they're not gonna fail again.

1969
01:44:34,093 --> 01:44:36,093
And how do you know
all this?

1970
01:44:36,225 --> 01:44:39,425
Because someone told them everything
they want to know about Michael,

1971
01:44:39,559 --> 01:44:42,225
and that someone is me.

1972
01:44:43,425 --> 01:44:44,626
Go on.

1973
01:44:45,592 --> 01:44:48,325
[Fletcher] <i>So I said I'd tell them
where Michael was for a price.</i>

1974
01:44:49,225 --> 01:44:53,026
But that money was pending till
after, you know, the deed was done.

1975
01:44:53,158 --> 01:44:54,192
[gunshot]

1976
01:44:54,993 --> 01:44:56,792
<i>And then when they
messed up the first time,</i>

1977
01:44:56,926 --> 01:45:00,258
I had a little rethink and came
up with my version 2.0 plan,

1978
01:45:00,392 --> 01:45:02,292
which is
when I came to see you.

1979
01:45:02,425 --> 01:45:05,125
You see, get my 20 mils
off Michael first

1980
01:45:05,258 --> 01:45:09,659
and then, after the event,
get paid again, double bubble.

1981
01:45:09,792 --> 01:45:13,192
But you and your mysterious friend
put paid to that, so well done, you.

1982
01:45:13,993 --> 01:45:15,492
Why did you just
look at your watch?

1983
01:45:16,959 --> 01:45:20,492
Well, it's like I say.
The Russians are gonna clean house.

1984
01:45:20,626 --> 01:45:23,692
And you are part of
that house, Raymond.

1985
01:45:23,826 --> 01:45:26,792
They're gonna get Michael when he comes
out of his meeting at the fish market.

1986
