1
00:00:03,961 --> 00:00:05,963
Just checking in
on an old serial number.

2
00:00:06,589 --> 00:00:07,882
Pre-Blackout.

3
00:00:08,049 --> 00:00:09,467
That's gonna be tough.

4
00:00:58,474 --> 00:01:00,309
What? You want some?

5
00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:24,166
<i>--are extremely dangerous
and subject to retirement.</i>

6
00:01:24,333 --> 00:01:25,793
<i>Harbouring a fugitive from...</i>

7
00:01:36,637 --> 00:01:38,472
-Ella.
-Hi.

8
00:01:38,639 --> 00:01:40,224
-How are you?
-I'm good.

9
00:01:40,391 --> 00:01:41,475
Where's your mom?

10
00:01:41,642 --> 00:01:43,936
She's over there.

11
00:01:46,147 --> 00:01:48,482
So, what did you bring me this time?

12
00:01:48,649 --> 00:01:50,318
I have...

13
00:01:50,693 --> 00:01:53,321
-<i>"The Power and the Glory."</i>
-Yes.

14
00:01:53,487 --> 00:01:55,239
Very exciting.

15
00:01:55,406 --> 00:01:57,241
Shouldn't take you long.

16
00:01:57,408 --> 00:01:59,535
It's about an outlaw priest...

17
00:01:59,702 --> 00:02:02,914
...who's trying to understand
the meaning of being human.

18
00:02:03,289 --> 00:02:06,125
It's not sad, is it?

19
00:02:10,546 --> 00:02:12,506
It's one of my favourites. You'll love it.

20
00:02:14,008 --> 00:02:15,885
-I'll see you next time.
-See you.

21
00:02:33,986 --> 00:02:34,987
Good work, Sapper.

22
00:02:37,073 --> 00:02:38,407
Seriously.

23
00:02:38,574 --> 00:02:40,576
-Three thousand.
-Three thousand?

24
00:02:40,743 --> 00:02:42,495
That barely covers my nematodes.

25
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:45,164
-At 3000, I'm already pushing it.
-Come on.

26
00:02:45,623 --> 00:02:48,542
Salt, you've bought
my blocks before.

27
00:02:48,709 --> 00:02:50,628
Nutrient rich, low impurities.
They're the best.

28
00:02:50,795 --> 00:02:53,673
You're not gonna get any better.
Come on.

29
00:02:53,839 --> 00:02:54,840
Four thousand.

30
00:02:55,007 --> 00:02:58,344
Don't like my offer,
you're welcome to try somewhere else.

31
00:03:02,014 --> 00:03:03,307
Good.

32
00:03:05,726 --> 00:03:07,770
Always pleasure dealing with you.

33
00:03:19,490 --> 00:03:21,409
Get off of her!

34
00:03:21,575 --> 00:03:23,411
Please, just leave us alone.

35
00:03:23,577 --> 00:03:24,870
-Keep back.
-Hey, I got a...

36
00:03:25,037 --> 00:03:26,622
-Help!
-Looks like somebody got scared.

37
00:03:26,789 --> 00:03:27,999
-Hey, hey, hey!
-No!

38
00:03:28,165 --> 00:03:31,085
Where you going, girl?
We got a plan for you and your mama.

39
00:03:31,961 --> 00:03:33,045
Get off of her!

40
00:03:33,963 --> 00:03:35,256
-Get off!
-Stay there!

41
00:03:35,423 --> 00:03:36,632
-No!
-Stay there!

42
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:55,878
Yeah, Aberan 2-2-B.

43
00:04:57,296 --> 00:05:01,759
I think I found the rogue skin job
you might be looking for.

44
00:05:02,843 --> 00:05:04,178
I got the address.

45
00:05:06,430 --> 00:05:08,766
I'll see you later.
