 Please no.

15
00:01:54,907 --> 00:01:57,358
 I was supposed to get married.

- [Leslie] Okay.

26
00:03:14,194 --> 00:03:15,505
- You're going to be all right?

27
00:03:15,505 --> 00:03:16,334
- Yeah.

28
00:03:21,753 --> 00:03:22,995
 You know he asked
 me to marry him

29
00:03:22,995 --> 00:03:24,480
 right before they
 found his body.

30
00:03:25,653 --> 00:03:26,482
 - I know.

31
00:03:35,525 --> 00:03:36,768
 I got us some weed.

32
00:03:38,287 --> 00:03:39,805
 - Patty's going to have a fit.

33
00:03:40,944 --> 00:03:42,222
 - Who said I was
 gonna offer her any?

34
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:44,258
 And besides, I don't
 remember the Bible

35
00:03:44,258 --> 00:03:45,708
 saying anything
 about getting high,

36
00:03:45,708 --> 00:03:47,986
 so little miss ecclesiastic
 can just deal with it.

37
00:03:51,161 --> 00:03:52,749
 I will hide these.

 [subtle music]

40
00:04:17,567 --> 00:04:18,396

41
00:04:18,396 --> 00:04:19,328
- Yeah.

42
00:04:19,328 --> 00:04:20,501
 - Is she okay?

43
00:04:20,501 --> 00:04:21,295
 - Seems to be.

44
00:04:24,194 --> 00:04:25,023
- Yuck.

45
00:04:32,824 --> 00:04:36,655
Guys, can you at least wait
until we get back to the house?

46
00:04:36,655 --> 00:04:37,484
- Sorry.

47
00:04:38,692 --> 00:04:40,210
 - You're being an
 ass, church girl.

48
00:04:40,210 --> 00:04:41,798
- What?

49
00:04:41,798 --> 00:04:43,421
- Listen Patty, you
don't have to be bitchy

50
00:04:43,421 --> 00:04:44,939
 because Thad never
 gives it to you.

51
00:04:44,939 --> 00:04:47,425
It's not my fault you guys
don't believe in premarital sex.

52
00:04:47,425 --> 00:04:48,529
 - Someone say my name?

53
00:04:50,151 --> 00:04:52,533
 - That was totally
 uncalled for, Regina.

54
00:04:54,432 --> 00:04:55,295
 Move over.

55
00:04:58,574 --> 00:05:00,369
 - You should apologize, babe.

56
00:05:00,369 --> 00:05:01,439
 - What just happened, hon?

57
00:05:01,439 --> 00:05:02,371
 - Nothing.

58
00:05:02,371 --> 00:05:03,613
 - [Regina] I'm sick of her.

59
00:05:03,613 --> 00:05:05,166
She thinks she's so much
better than everybody.

60
00:05:05,166 --> 00:05:06,961
 - I know but, we're spending
 this whole weekend together.

61
00:05:06,961 --> 00:05:08,480
 Just try to be a
 little cordial, huh?

62
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:10,379
 We're doing this for
 Leslie, remember?

63
00:05:12,553 --> 00:05:13,554
 - All right.

64
00:05:19,871 --> 00:05:21,044
 Patty?

65
00:05:21,044 --> 00:05:22,563
- What?

66
00:05:22,563 --> 00:05:24,910
 - That was disrespectful,
 I'm sorry for saying that.

67
00:05:26,118 --> 00:05:29,225
 - It was, but thank
 you for apologizing.

68
00:05:30,364 --> 00:05:31,296
- Thad?

69
00:05:31,296 --> 00:05:32,470
- Yeah?

70
00:05:32,470 --> 00:05:33,919
 - I'm sorry for
 saying that to you.

71
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:36,577
- Oh, it's okay.

72
00:05:36,577 --> 00:05:38,648
I don't even know
what's going on anyway.

73
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:42,203
 - Are we good?

74
00:05:42,203 --> 00:05:43,688
 - We're good.

75
00:05:43,688 --> 00:05:44,689
 - We're ready to go?

76
00:05:47,139 --> 00:05:49,521
 - I want to sit in the front.

77
00:06:01,671 --> 00:06:02,672
 - Off we go.

85
00:07:03,837 --> 00:07:06,184
I'm so glad you're home.

86
00:07:06,184 --> 00:07:07,910
 I made you meatloaf.

87
00:07:09,152 --> 00:07:10,360
 - Thanks mama.

88
00:07:22,234 --> 00:07:24,374
 - You still like
 your mama's meatloaf?

89
00:07:26,687 --> 00:07:28,137
 - Looks delicious.

90
00:07:30,035 --> 00:07:31,381
 - You forgetting something?

91
00:07:36,145 --> 00:07:39,389
 - Bless us oh Lord
 with these thy gifts

92
00:07:39,389 --> 00:07:42,496
which we are about to
receive from thy bounty,

93
00:07:42,496 --> 00:07:44,567
 through Christ our Lord, amen.

94
00:07:44,567 --> 00:07:45,430
- That's better.

95
00:07:47,190 --> 00:07:52,023
 My poor boy, must've been
 awful for you in that prison.

96
00:07:52,023 --> 00:07:54,508
 I worried, I worried
 about you every day.

97
00:07:54,508 --> 00:07:55,923
 - Wasn't that bad.

98
00:07:55,923 --> 00:08:00,687
 - Well, your mama
 really missed you.

99
00:08:00,687 --> 00:08:01,860
- I missed you too, mom.

100
00:08:03,034 --> 00:08:06,382
- [Mom] I'm gonna go lay
down for a little bit.

101
00:08:06,382 --> 00:08:09,074
 My legs just ain't
 what they used to be.

102
00:08:09,074 --> 00:08:12,112
 There's potatoes for
 you on the stove.

103
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:15,495

 [suspenseful music]

108
00:09:18,247 --> 00:09:19,248
- Take care, ma.

109
00:09:19,248 --> 00:09:20,663
 - Where you going, honey?

110
00:09:20,663 --> 00:09:22,492
- I'm going to go hang out
with Buzz for a couple of days.

111
00:09:22,492 --> 00:09:23,563
 - [Mom] Well, don't
 you want to stay home

112
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:25,323
 your first night out?

113
00:09:25,323 --> 00:09:27,981
 - No ma, I just want to go
 hang out with my friends.

114
00:09:27,981 --> 00:09:30,155
 - Oh, Buzz ain't your friend,
 he ain't even Christian.

115
00:09:30,155 --> 00:09:32,364
 You remember what your
 daddy used to say?

116
00:09:32,364 --> 00:09:33,607
- Yeah.

117
00:09:33,607 --> 00:09:34,470
- What?

118
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:38,888
 - Jesus is my
 salvation and choice.

119
00:09:39,751 --> 00:09:42,478
 - And what's a choice?

120
00:09:46,724 --> 00:09:49,589
 - If Jesus did
 all that they say,

121
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:53,385
 then you must choose to turn
 away from all that is earthly

122
00:09:54,455 --> 00:09:56,078
 and follow him into heaven.

123
00:09:56,078 --> 00:09:56,906
 - Or?

124
00:09:57,873 --> 00:09:59,219
 - Or turn your back on heaven

125
00:09:59,219 --> 00:10:02,187
 and bask in that
 which is earthly.

126
00:10:02,187 --> 00:10:03,016
 - And?

127
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:06,709
- Burn in hell for all eternity.

128
00:10:08,746 --> 00:10:10,161
 - And did you choose, honey?

129
00:10:16,754 --> 00:10:17,996
 - Yeah ma.

130
00:10:21,966 --> 00:10:22,794
I chose.

131
00:10:30,043 --> 00:10:30,940
 - My brother!

132
00:10:31,803 --> 00:10:34,150
 - Buzz Saw, my man.

133
00:10:34,150 --> 00:10:36,359
 - God dammit bro,
 how long has it been?

134
00:10:36,359 --> 00:10:38,223
- 10 years, man.

135
00:10:38,223 --> 00:10:40,156
 10 long mother fucking years.

136
00:10:40,156 --> 00:10:41,364

140
00:10:48,475 --> 00:10:51,202
 I want to get some ice and
 I wanna go see some people.

141
00:10:52,134 --> 00:10:53,100
- What you have in mind?

142
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:54,550
- You know what I have in mind.

143
00:10:54,550 --> 00:10:56,241
 - I hear you.

144
00:10:56,241 --> 00:10:57,933

149
00:11:23,752 --> 00:11:25,063
 - How much?

150
00:11:25,063 --> 00:11:25,892
 - Two hundred.

151
00:11:27,134 --> 00:11:27,963
- You got cash?

152
00:11:29,171 --> 00:11:31,035
 Whoa, what the fuck
 you doing, man?

153
00:11:31,035 --> 00:11:32,105
 Put that shit away.

154
00:11:32,105 --> 00:11:33,554
- What?

155
00:11:33,554 --> 00:11:36,523
- That 5.0 been on me like
white on rice last couple weeks.

156
00:11:36,523 --> 00:11:37,800
 Not here.

157
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:39,284
 - Okay, where?

158
00:11:39,284 --> 00:11:41,735

162
00:12:12,801 --> 00:12:14,906

163
00:12:14,906 --> 00:12:16,045
 We do drive through.

00:12:49,699 --> 00:12:51,632
 - Nah man, it ain't like that.

171
00:12:51,632 --> 00:12:52,875
 She's my girl.

172
00:12:54,049 --> 00:12:56,430
 - Then why is she
 dressed like a whore?

173
00:12:56,430 --> 00:12:58,087
 - The fuck you

174
00:12:59,502 --> 00:13:01,125
 - I asked you why your girl

175
00:13:01,125 --> 00:13:03,990
 is dressed like a two
 dollar Tijuana hooker.

176
00:13:03,990 --> 00:13:06,924
 - You mother fucker,
 I'm gonna, fuck that.

177
00:13:08,788 --> 00:13:09,892
 Say it again, bitch.

 Let's just bounce.

 We don't want no trouble.

Say you're sorry, Cliff.

182
00:13:25,011 --> 00:13:26,115
 - I'm sorry.

183
00:13:26,115 --> 00:13:29,084
What he said, I'm sorry.

184
00:13:29,084 --> 00:13:30,188
 - You better be sorry.

185

00:18:30,212 --> 00:18:31,420
Would you like some pot?

281
00:18:32,801 --> 00:18:33,836
 - You're all gonna die, child.

282
00:18:35,286 --> 00:18:36,701
 Get out while you can.

283
00:18:36,701 --> 00:18:39,187
 There's an evil coming here.

284
00:18:39,187 --> 00:18:41,016

00:18:41,016 --> 00:18:41,844
Come on.

286
00:18:43,708 --> 00:18:45,400

 Who the fuck was that?

289
00:18:50,784 --> 00:18:52,234
- That's Helen.

290
00:18:52,234 --> 00:18:54,478
 I've known her since I
 was a kid, she's homeless.

291
00:18:54,478 --> 00:18:55,686
 It's okay.

292
00:18:55,686 --> 00:18:56,928
 - She scared you
 babe, are you okay?

293
00:18:56,928 --> 00:18:58,344
 - Yeah, I'm fine.

294
00:19:05,454 --> 00:19:06,973
 - God.

295
00:19:06,973 --> 00:19:07,905
- What?

296
00:19:07,905 --> 00:19:09,182
 - Look at those two weirdos.

297
00:19:11,771 --> 00:19:12,703
- Just leave them alone.

298
00:19:12,703 --> 00:19:14,083
 - They look like criminals.

299
00:19:14,083 --> 00:19:17,984
 - Well hello there, miss.

300
00:19:17,984 --> 00:19:19,537
 What are you up

301
00:19:19,537 --> 00:19:21,090

What's your name, baby.

00:19:23,541 --> 00:19:24,715

309
00:19:33,448 --> 00:19:36,658
 - Well that's not so
 nice, is it, muffin?

310
00:19:36,658 --> 00:19:38,418
- Get off me, you loser!

311
00:19:38,418 --> 00:19:39,833
 - Hey, get your
 hands off my girl!

312
00:19:41,007 --> 00:19:42,284
- You better watch it boy scout

313
00:19:42,284 --> 00:19:44,459
or I'm gonna cut you right here.

314
00:19:44,459 --> 00:19:45,701
 - Don't hurt him.

315
00:19:45,701 --> 00:19:47,945
 - We don't want
 any trouble, sir.

316
00:19:47,945 --> 00:19:50,223
 - Looks like trouble
 just found you, bitch.

317
00:19:50,223 --> 00:19:51,190
 - Leave him alone.

318
00:19:59,128 --> 00:20:01,200
 - You believe in this shit?

319
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,684
 Huh?

320
00:20:02,684 --> 00:20:05,756
 You know it's all just bull
 shit, you know that right?

321
00:20:05,756 --> 00:20:06,584
 - Let go.

322
00:20:10,623 --> 00:20:12,728
- What are you going to
do about it, sweetheart?

323
00:20:13,764 --> 00:20:16,042
 [grunting]

324
00:20:17,181 --> 00:20:19,114
 - [Buzz] 5.0 man,
 we've gotta split now.

325
00:20:20,874 --> 00:20:22,531
- It's your lucky day princess.

326
00:20:22,531 --> 00:20:23,946
- What do you want, pig?

327
00:20:23,946 --> 00:20:25,224
 - You spit on me.

328
00:20:32,990 --> 00:20:34,163
 - Oh my God.

329
00:20:34,163 --> 00:20:35,993
- Are you okay?

330
00:20:35,993 --> 00:20:37,684
 - I think so, are you?

331
00:20:37,684 --> 00:20:39,099
 Do you need to go
 to the hospital?

332
00:20:39,099 --> 00:20:40,308
 - No, I'm fine, I'm fine.

333
00:20:43,552 --> 00:20:44,346
Sheriff?

334
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:46,797
 - Yes sir.

335
00:20:46,797 --> 00:20:48,488
 - [Thad] Please help us,
 two guys just attacked us.

336
00:20:48,488 --> 00:20:49,834
- Well, where are they?

337
00:20:49,834 --> 00:20:51,905
 - They just left,
 two guys just now.

338
00:20:51,905 --> 00:20:53,769
 - Okay, what happened?

339
00:20:53,769 --> 00:20:55,978
- One of them put his
hands on my girlfriend.

340
00:20:55,978 --> 00:20:58,222
 The other one put a knife out,
 said he was going to cut me.

341
00:20:58,222 --> 00:20:59,672
 - Listen, are either
 of you injured?

342
00:20:59,672 --> 00:21:00,914
 Do you need an ambulance?

343
00:21:00,914 --> 00:21:02,019
 - No, we're all right,
 but they just left,

344
00:21:02,019 --> 00:21:03,676
 they went that way.

345
00:21:03,676 --> 00:21:04,953
 - [Sheriff] You guys sit here.

346
00:21:04,953 --> 00:21:06,368
 I'm going to go see if
 I can grab them, okay?

347
00:21:14,238 --> 00:21:15,274
 Leslie Van Hooten?

348
00:21:16,205 --> 00:21:17,793
 - Sheriff Gooden.

349
00:21:17,793 --> 00:21:20,555
 - I see your friends had a
 bit of a scare here today.

350
00:21:20,555 --> 00:21:22,315
 What brings you up to
 these parts this weekend?

351
00:21:22,315 --> 00:21:24,524
 - These are all my
 friends from grad school.

352
00:21:24,524 --> 00:21:27,458
 You know it's the one year
 anniversary of John's death.

353
00:21:27,458 --> 00:21:29,011
 - I know, I know.

354
00:21:29,011 --> 00:21:31,393
 - They've come up here this
 weekend to keep me company.

355
00:21:31,393 --> 00:21:32,567
 - They seem like
 good friends to me.

356
00:21:32,567 --> 00:21:33,395
- Yeah.

357
00:21:34,534 --> 00:21:36,225
- [Sheriff] I was unable
to find those guys.

358
00:21:36,225 --> 00:21:38,676
 Usually things like
 this are just losers

359
00:21:38,676 --> 00:21:40,126
 passing through town.

360
00:21:40,126 --> 00:21:42,887
 Most likely they're,
 they're long gone by now.

361
00:21:42,887 --> 00:21:44,303
Did you guys want to
come down to the station

362
00:21:44,303 --> 00:21:45,373
 and fill out a report?

363
00:21:47,892 --> 00:21:48,859
 - What do you think?

364
00:21:50,067 --> 00:21:52,345
 - I kind of just want
 to get to the house.

365
00:21:53,346 --> 00:21:54,174
- Yeah.

366
00:21:56,073 --> 00:21:58,109
Yeah, I think uh, we'll

549
00:34:05,215 --> 00:34:07,424
 - [Tom] Yes, pretty please.

550
00:34:07,424 --> 00:34:08,908
- [Regina] Les?

551
00:34:08,908 --> 00:34:10,531
 - [Leslie] Oh, no thank
 you, it gives me a headache.

552
00:34:13,603 --> 00:34:18,573
 - I'd like to make a toast
 to my best friend, Leslie.

553
00:34:19,747 --> 00:34:22,060
 We love you and
 we all love John.

554
00:34:23,475 --> 00:34:27,755
John, may he be in a better
place and your soul be at peace.

555
00:34:27,755 --> 00:34:28,583
- Amen.

556
00:34:30,413 --> 00:34:32,104

00:34:32,104 --> 00:34:32,967
- Amen.

558
00:34:36,074 --> 00:34:38,835
 - Thank you guys so much for
 coming up here this weekend,

559
00:34:38,835 --> 00:34:40,147
 it means a lot to me.

560
00:34:40,147 --> 00:34:41,424
 - We're happy to be here.

561
00:34:43,391 --> 00:34:45,773
 - Let's eat before
 the food gets cold.

563
00:34:48,534 --> 00:34:52,159
 - Leslie, what is
 that painting of?

564
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:55,921
 - That's Marinette, she was
 a Haitian freedom fighter.

565
00:34:55,921 --> 00:34:58,096
 My dad got it when he was
 volunteering as a doctor

566
00:34:58,096 --> 00:35:00,098
 down there with the Red Cross.

567
00:35:00,098 --> 00:35:01,168

 a place to hit it.

I wanna get stoned, kid.

571
00:35:15,113 --> 00:35:18,046
 - We got to find a house first
 and one with no neighbors.

572
00:35:18,046 --> 00:35:21,291
 With rich people, you always
 gotta find the right house.

573
00:35:21,291 --> 00:35:22,120
 - We will.

574
00:35:29,368 --> 00:35:30,404
 Stop, stop, stop.

575
00:35:30,404 --> 00:35:32,060
 - [Buzz] What?

576
00:35:32,060 --> 00:35:33,372
- Remember them?

577
00:35:35,063 --> 00:35:36,927
 [laughter]

578
00:35:36,927 --> 00:35:38,412
You've gotta be fucking
kidding me, right?

579
00:35:38,412 --> 00:35:41,587
- [Buzz] This is our
lucky fucking day, bro!

580
00:35:41,587 --> 00:35:43,900
 [laughter]

581
00:35:43,900 --> 00:35:45,867
This is going to be fun.

582
00:35:45,867 --> 00:35:47,386
 - Park, park off the road.

583
00:35:47,386 --> 00:35:49,457
 Let's smoke some
 shit before we go in.

584
00:35:49,457 --> 00:35:51,079
- This is gonna be fun.

585
00:35:51,079 --> 00:35:52,322
 - Yeah, I'm gonna
 fuck the brains

586
00:35:52,322 --> 00:35:54,221
 right out of that
 little blonde bitch.

587
00:35:57,155 --> 00:35:59,502
 - Stop, you are
 so not doing this.

588
00:35:59,502 --> 00:36:00,296
- You sure guys?

589
00:36:00,296 --> 00:36:01,159
- Yes, not another word.

590
00:36:01,159 --> 00:36:02,815
 - Here, what can I do?

591
00:36:02,815 --> 00:36:04,817
- Uh, take these, honey.

592
00:36:04,817 --> 00:36:05,991
Put them in the kitchen.

593
00:36:05,991 --> 00:36:07,165
Thanks.

594
00:36:07,165 --> 00:36:08,580
 - I think I'm going
 to go lay down.

595
00:36:08,580 --> 00:36:11,272
 It's been a long day,
 I'm just exhausted.

596
00:36:11,272 --> 00:36:12,618
 - Yeah, go get some sleep.

597
00:36:12,618 --> 00:36:14,724
- Knock on my door if
you guys need anything.

598
00:36:14,724 --> 00:36:16,139
 I'll see you in the morning.

599
00:36:17,347 --> 00:36:18,383
 - Good night, Leslie.

600
00:36:25,183 --> 00:36:28,841
 - You think she's
 going to be okay?

601
00:36:28,841 --> 00:36:29,808
- I don't know.

602
00:36:29,808 --> 00:36:31,430
I really get worried sometimes.

603
00:36:31,430 --> 00:36:32,880
 - Me too.

604
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:34,813
- Well, you guys got this right?

605
00:36:34,813 --> 00:36:35,676
- Thad.

606
00:36:35,676 --> 00:36:37,471
 - Yeah, we got it.

607
00:36:37,471 --> 00:36:38,817
 - He said you got it.

608
00:36:38,817 --> 00:36:39,749
 - That's rude.

609
00:36:39,749 --> 00:36:41,647
 - I got it, it's fine.

610
00:36:56,110 --> 00:36:58,354
 [laughter]

611
00:37:01,391 --> 00:37:02,599

612
00:37:11,298 --> 00:37:12,954
- Hey, not here.

613
00:37:20,824 --> 00:37:23,551
 Well, we shouldn't
 go down there.

614
00:37:27,866 --> 00:37:29,626
 Leslie, are you okay?

615
00:37:30,938 --> 00:37:32,215
 We're sorry.

616
00:37:32,215 --> 00:37:33,975
 - You cannot go down there.

617
00:37:33,975 --> 00:37:35,529
 You could get hurt.

618
00:37:35,529 --> 00:37:37,772
 - We were just being stupid,
 it won't happen again.

619
00:37:37,772 --> 00:37:38,946
 - We're sorry.

620
00:37:38,946 --> 00:37:40,188
 - That's my father's
 private space,

621
00:37:40,188 --> 00:37:41,776
 no one is allowed
 down there ever.

622
00:37:42,639 --> 00:37:43,847
- I know, it's my fault.

623
00:37:44,710 --> 00:37:45,815
 It won't happen again.

624
00:37:47,057 --> 00:37:47,886
 - Goodnight.

625
00:37:56,066 --> 00:37:56,895
 - What's that?

626
00:37:58,310 --> 00:38:00,830
 - I've never seen
 her like that before.

627
00:38:00,830 --> 00:38:03,142
 - I know, she actually
 kinda scared me.

628
00:38:04,696 --> 00:38:06,249
 I think I lost my hard on.

629
00:38:07,423 --> 00:38:08,769
 - You're such an ass.

 get married, please.

Leslie, can you come down here?

640
00:39:37,789 --> 00:39:39,411
 I think someone's at the door.

 found you again, bitch.

 wake up for a while.

It's the plumber, come
out, it's an emergency.

730
00:45:00,490 --> 00:45:02,147
 The septic tank's overflowed.

731
00:45:07,705 --> 00:45:08,982
 Hello?

732
00:45:08,982 --> 00:45:10,362
 Is there anybody in here?

733
00:45:11,398 --> 00:45:12,606
 Is there anybody in here?

734
00:45:12,606 --> 00:45:14,642
Come out now and I won't
hurt you, I promise.

00:45:16,058 --> 00:45:17,576
 Come on, come on, come on out.

736
00:45:23,168 --> 00:45:26,413
 If I was hiding in this room,

737
00:45:26,413 --> 00:45:28,898
 I would hide in the closet.

738
00:45:31,729 --> 00:45:34,524
Ah well, if there is anybody
in here, you can fuck yourself.

739
00:45:34,524 --> 00:45:36,009
 We'll get you sooner or later.

741
00:45:43,706 --> 00:45:45,846
 Well, I couldn't find nobody.

742
00:45:45,846 --> 00:45:47,606
 I think Blondie's
 telling the truth.

743
00:45:47,606 --> 00:45:50,057
 - I told you we're
 the only ones here!

744
00:45:50,057 --> 00:45:51,196

 Get it going, bubba.

753
00:46:25,196 --> 00:46:26,749

 you break off this?

 - What's going on?

760
00:46:50,808 --> 00:46:52,706

 those guys came back

761
00:46:52,706 --> 00:46:55,467
 and we have to get out of
 here because they tied us up.

762
00:47:00,024 --> 00:47:01,266

 Yeah, hit it bro.

 Fuck!

781
00:47:55,217 --> 00:47:56,839
 and not be able to
 do a fucking thing

782
00:47:56,839 --> 00:47:59,186
while another man's
fucking her in the ass.

 What are we going to do, man?

801
00:49:02,663 --> 00:49:04,251
 - We gotta break this,

802
00:49:04,251 --> 00:49:05,252
 and we gotta go to the
 kitchen to get a knife

803
00:49:05,252 --> 00:49:07,772
 and cut these off.

915
00:56:17,684 --> 00:56:22,033
 - Okay, now I gotta go find
 that bitch you let get away!

916
00:56:24,795 --> 00:56:26,383
- You wanted some help?

917
00:56:26,383 --> 00:56:28,488
- Yeah, I want some
fucking help, dumb ass.

918
00:56:28,488 --> 00:56:29,972
 You're the one that lost her.

919
00:56:38,912 --> 00:56:41,190
 - You wait right here baby.

920
00:56:41,190 --> 00:56:43,503

 friends, scumbag!

923
00:56:51,546 --> 00:56:52,719
 Oh my God, Patty.

924
00:56:53,927 --> 00:56:55,066
What did they do to you?

925
00:56:55,066 --> 00:56:57,724
- Les, where's Thad, is he okay?

926
00:57:00,486 --> 00:57:02,695
 Come on, we gotta

927

 Who the fuck did this?

932

 - I don't know, I don't know.

933
00:57:35,935 --> 00:57:38,385
 - Is there somebody in there?

934
00:57:40,008 --> 00:57:42,355
 'Cause you're fucking
 dead if there is.

935
00:57:45,392 --> 00:57:46,221
 Fuck!

 - [Cliff] No, I'm not okay.

943
00:58:15,837 --> 00:58:17,701
 That bitch hit me in the nuts.

944
00:58:17,701 --> 00:58:18,943
 - Jesus dude.

945
00:58:20,255 --> 00:58:21,428
 Where the fuck did she go?

946
00:58:21,428 --> 00:58:22,637
 - [Cliff] She went down there.

947
00:58:22,637 --> 00:58:24,949
 See if you can get
 that door open.

948
00:58:24,949 --> 00:58:27,227

 Whoever's there, come out

00:59:23,629 --> 00:59:24,595
 - It's me, Sheriff.

957
00:59:25,907 --> 00:59:27,322
 - Leslie?

958
00:59:27,322 --> 00:59:28,703
 You scared the shit out of me.

 Are you okay?

 broke in the house.

00:59:33,673 --> 00:59:34,536
 - No.

963
00:59:34,536 --> 00:59:35,779
 - Where are they?

964
00:59:35,779 --> 00:59:36,711
 - I don't know, they
 have knives, I just,

965
00:59:36,711 --> 00:59:37,919
 I don't know where they are.

966
00:59:37,919 --> 00:59:39,161
 Last time I saw them,

967
00:59:39,161 --> 00:59:40,680
 they were in the guest
 bedroom in the back.

968
00:59:40,680 --> 00:59:43,752
- Okay listen, Leslie, lock
yourself back into the basement,

969
00:59:43,752 --> 00:59:45,754
 close the door, don't
 open it for anybody.

970
00:59:45,754 --> 00:59:46,755
 I'll come get you.

971
00:59:46,755 --> 00:59:47,756
 You're gonna be okay.

972
00:59:47,756 --> 00:59:49,033

 up where I can see them,

975
01:00:06,326 --> 01:00:08,432

 - Yes sir, you
 got me, I give up.

979
01:00:41,983 --> 01:00:43,778
- You're a sick son of a bitch.

980
01:00:43,778 --> 01:00:45,883
 I should kill you
 where you stand.

981
01:00:45,883 --> 01:00:48,645
 - That wouldn't be police
 procedure, Sheriff, would it?

982
01:00:49,715 --> 01:00:50,888
- I don't care!

983
01:00:50,888 --> 01:00:52,510
I'll tell them you attacked me,

984
01:00:52,510 --> 01:00:54,754
 it makes no difference to me.

985
01:00:54,754 --> 01:00:56,480
 - If you're gonna
 do me, then do me.

986
01:00:58,516 --> 01:01:00,277
 - That's too easy.

987
01:01:00,277 --> 01:01:01,968
 It's too easy, I'd
 rather have you locked up

988
01:01:01,968 --> 01:01:04,281
 in a fucking cage for
 the rest of your life

989
01:01:04,281 --> 01:01:06,663
 and I'll make sure you have
 a nice fucking roommate

990
01:01:06,663 --> 01:01:07,871

01:01:07,871 --> 01:01:09,113
 with a big dick that's
 gonna ass fuck you

992
01:01:09,113 --> 01:01:10,701
 for the rest of
 your fucking days.

993
01:01:10,701 --> 01:01:13,014
 - I already been raped
 in prison, Sheriff,

994
01:01:13,014 --> 01:01:14,118
 I already done that.

995
01:01:14,118 --> 01:01:16,362
- Shut up, where's your friend?

996
01:01:16,362 --> 01:01:17,225
 - He ran.

997
01:01:17,225 --> 01:01:18,709
 - Smart man.

998
01:01:18,709 --> 01:01:21,194
 I want you to turn around, put
 your hands behind your back

999
01:01:21,194 --> 01:01:23,093
 and so help me God,
 you move a muscle,

1000
01:01:23,093 --> 01:01:24,646
 I'll kill you where you stand.

1001
01:01:24,646 --> 01:01:25,923
 - Yes sir.

1002
01:01:25,923 --> 01:01:28,236
Wouldn't want no trouble
with law enforcement.

I'll fucking curb stomp

1009
01:01:51,328 --> 01:01:53,088
 - [Buzz] That pig shot me.

1010
01:01:53,986 --> 01:01:55,366
 - Aw, quit your belly aching.

1011
01:01:55,366 --> 01:01:58,473
- Fuck you, I gotta tie
something around this!

1012
01:01:58,473 --> 01:01:59,716
Maybe next time,

1013
01:01:59,716 --> 01:02:02,891
we don't snort the ice
until after we're done.

1014
01:02:02,891 --> 01:02:04,962
 This sucks!

I never got to fuck her.

 - All right, enough screwing
 around, we got shit to do.

1026
01:03:14,031 --> 01:03:15,584
We gotta rob this fucking house

1027

 and we gotta kill that bitch
 in the basement, all right?

1028
01:03:17,828 --> 01:03:19,381
 Now I want you to stay

1029
01:03:19,381 --> 01:03:20,624
 make sure she don't come up.

1030
01:03:20,624 --> 01:03:22,419
 If she does, kill the bitch.

 Should we just bounce?

 Fuck her.

 That's gonna be a
 pain in the ass, man.

 This is a big house.

 such a fucking wimp?

 Who are you people?

 is a big misunderstanding.

 join us in the basement,

 into the cult of
 Marinette Bras Cheche.

 we had a guest who liberated
 himself temporarily,

 but the ritual didn't
 take, so to speak,

1164
01:12:28,378 --> 01:12:32,520
 so this year, we made
 a very meticulous plan

01:12:32,520 --> 01:12:34,729
 to follow the old rights,

1166
01:12:34,729 --> 01:12:38,284
 which requires four
 human sacrifices,

01:22:11,996 --> 01:22:13,376
 It's all set with
 the authorities.

1271
01:22:13,376 --> 01:22:14,274
 - Okay dad.

1272
01:22:15,482 --> 01:22:17,104
 - Okay, off you go.

1273
01:22:23,214 --> 01:22:25,457
 [laughter]

1274
01:22:32,533 --> 01:22:35,295
- You know, I think it's
time I meet a nice guy.

1275
01:22:35,295 --> 01:22:37,504
 [laughter]

1276
01:22:37,504 --> 01:22:39,506
- Well I think you're
going to meet Mr. Right

1277
01:22:39,506 --> 01:22:43,199
 one of these days, but
 this is a tough family

1278
01:22:43,199 --> 01:22:44,821
for a boy to deal with.

1279
01:22:44,821 --> 01:22:47,203
 - Yeah, just ask John.

1280
01:22:47,203 --> 01:22:51,000
 - [Irene] Peter, Peter,
 you just, don't be fresh.

1281
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:53,761
- All right, all right,
I just didn't like him.

1282
01:22:53,761 --> 01:22:54,797
 - Stop it.

1283
01:22:54,797 --> 01:22:56,626
 Stop it you, you did like him.

1284
01:22:56,626 --> 01:22:58,076
 - All right, okay.

1285
01:22:59,181 --> 01:22:59,975
- Okay.

1286
01:23:03,840 --> 01:23:05,083
- Say goodbye to Regina.

1287
01:23:05,083 --> 01:23:06,602
 - Dad.

1288
01:23:06,602 --> 01:23:08,086
 [laughter]

1289
01:23:08,086 --> 01:23:09,777
 - Peter, oh Peter
 get outta here.

1290
01:23:11,193 --> 01:23:12,849
 What, this is an emotional
 moment, let me have it.

1291
01:23:12,849 --> 01:23:14,127
- Okay.

1292
01:23:14,127 --> 01:23:14,990
 - Oh darling.

1293
01:23:16,163 --> 01:23:19,304
 Oh sweetheart, you
 just, you stay safe

1294
01:23:19,304 --> 01:23:21,134
and you drive carefully.

1295
01:23:21,134 --> 01:23:23,722
 I miss you so much
 when you're not here.

1296
01:23:25,862 --> 01:23:29,004
 - Okay, okay I'll be safe.

1297
01:23:29,004 --> 01:23:31,696
 - Yes, safe, safe and
 listen you call me,

1298
01:23:31,696 --> 01:23:33,008
 you call me the
 minute you get there.

1299
01:23:33,008 --> 01:23:35,320
 - All right, all right, okay.

1300
01:23:35,320 --> 01:23:36,149
 Okay.

1301
01:23:37,115 --> 01:23:37,978
 - Oh.

1302
01:23:43,018 --> 01:23:45,365
Oh Peter, I feel so bad for her.

1303
01:23:45,365 --> 01:23:47,229
 - It's gonna be
 okay, she's strong.

1304
01:23:47,229 --> 01:23:48,437
She'll make it.

1305
01:23:48,437 --> 01:23:49,748
 - You're right,
 you're always right.

1306
01:23:49,748 --> 01:23:51,716
 Why are you always right?

1307
01:23:51,716 --> 01:23:52,924
 - That's why you married me.

1308
01:23:52,924 --> 01:23:55,168
 - I married you
 because I love you.

1309
01:23:55,168 --> 01:23:56,341
 - Not for my money?

1310
01:23:56,341 --> 01:23:57,239
 - Oh God no.

1311
01:23:57,239 --> 01:23:59,517
 [laughter]

1312
01:24:18,191 --> 01:24:21,021
 I think I'd like some
 alone time with my husband.

1313
01:24:23,748 --> 01:24:25,750
 - Oh, well what about
 the hot chocolate?

1314
01:24:25,750 --> 01:24:27,510
 - Oh, you'll have
 to work for that.

1315
01:24:27,510 --> 01:24:29,340
 But you are gonna
 have to work for it.

1316
01:24:29,340 --> 01:24:32,929
I hope you haven't expended all
your energy in the basement.

1317
01:24:32,929 --> 01:24:35,380
 - No, I just have one
 more grip down there.

1318
01:24:35,380 --> 01:24:37,210
- And she's not going anywhere.

1319
01:24:41,317 --> 01:24:44,734

1320
01:24:44,734 --> 01:24:47,634
