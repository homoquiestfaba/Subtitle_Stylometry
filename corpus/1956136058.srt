We were hoping to have
this opportunity

50
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,793
before he's transferred
to the new facility.

00:02:44,795 --> 00:02:46,795
Glass Hill
is far less accommodating.

52

53

to be studied.

my life's obsession.

58
00:02:59,444 --> 00:03:02,445
I've examined every single
case file written on him.

59
00:03:02,447 --> 00:03:05,715
I was a student of Dr. Loomis
before he passed away.

60
00:03:05,717 --> 00:03:07,917
And then I lobbied
the University of Illinois

61
00:03:07,919 --> 00:03:10,453
to be assigned
to Michael myself.

62
00:03:10,455 --> 00:03:11,921
Any progress?

63
00:03:11,923 --> 00:03:15,458
Well, he's been seen by
over 50 clinical psychiatrists,

64
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:17,862
and with each,
many different opinions.

65
00:03:17,864 --> 00:03:20,931
Dr. Loomis was the only one
to see him in the wild.

66
00:03:20,933 --> 00:03:23,868
And he concluded he was
nothing more than pure evil.

67
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:26,937
Our patients get fresh air,
sunshine,

68
00:03:26,939 --> 00:03:31,475
a view, proper exercise,
healthy diet.

69
00:03:31,477 --> 00:03:33,611
It pains me
to see him transferred

70
00:03:33,613 --> 00:03:37,481
to that less-than-desirable
facility.

71
00:03:37,483 --> 00:03:39,619
And there he is.

72
00:03:40,553 --> 00:03:42,019
He can speak.

73
00:03:42,021 --> 00:03:43,754
He just chooses not to.

74
00:03:43,756 --> 00:03:46,891
I'd love to stand
closer to him, if I may.

75
00:03:46,893 --> 00:03:49,895
Get a sense of his awareness,
or lack of awareness.

76
00:03:49,897 --> 00:03:53,031
Oh, make no mistake,
he's aware.

77
00:03:53,033 --> 00:03:55,133
He was watching you
as you arrived.

78
00:03:55,135 --> 00:03:59,037
Perhaps you'd like to tie
your left shoelace?

79
00:03:59,039 --> 00:04:02,807
Mr. Tovoli here, the gentleman
with the umbrella,

80
00:04:02,809 --> 00:04:05,076
has a fixation for such things.

81

82
00:04:06,947 --> 00:04:08,015
Of course.

83
00:04:09,917 --> 00:04:13,121
And now step up
to the yellow line.

84
00:04:14,521 --> 00:04:16,655
And no further.

under any circumstances.

173
00:11:15,956 --> 00:11:18,423
Aaron and I have made several

174
00:11:18,425 --> 00:11:21,594
award-winning

175
00:11:21,596 --> 00:11:23,161
Our last project shed new light

176
00:11:23,163 --> 00:11:24,930
on a murder case
from 20 years ago.

177
00:11:24,932 --> 00:11:30,236
We like to reexamine incidents
with an unbiased lens.

178
00:11:30,238 --> 00:11:32,071
I believe there's
a lot to learn

179
00:11:32,073 --> 00:11:33,541
from the horrors
you experienced.

180
00:11:34,676 --> 00:11:36,642
There's nothing to learn.

181
00:11:36,644 --> 00:11:39,645

182

or discoveries.

183
00:11:43,385 --> 00:11:44,984

You don't believe
in the Boogeyman?

188
00:11:51,494 --> 00:11:58,164
I believe in Michael Myers,
deranged serial killer, but...

189
00:11:58,166 --> 00:12:00,403
the Boogeyman, no.

190
00:12:02,238 --> 00:12:04,573
Well, you should.

191
00:12:05,741 --> 00:12:07,608
Okay.

192
00:12:07,610 --> 00:12:09,643
Michael Myers is a human being

193
00:12:09,645 --> 00:12:12,746
who killed his sister
when he was six years old.

194
00:12:12,748 --> 00:12:14,450
Then he came after you.

195
00:12:15,384 --> 00:12:17,551
We just want to know why.

196
00:12:17,553 --> 00:12:19,453
We want a glimpse
inside his mind.

is so important.

when the state came

to take your daughter away.

211
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:04,333
She was 12 years old.

212
00:13:04,335 --> 00:13:06,635
They said you were
an unfit mother.

213
00:13:06,637 --> 00:13:09,474
How long until
you regained custody?

214
00:13:13,044 --> 00:13:14,710
I didn't.

215
00:13:14,712 --> 00:13:17,648
But you already knew that.

216
00:13:19,283 --> 00:13:21,283
Laurie, we saw him.

217
00:13:21,285 --> 00:13:23,687
We met with Michael.

218
00:13:23,689 --> 00:13:26,121
I showed him the mask.

219
00:13:26,123 --> 00:13:28,090
There was nothing.

220
00:13:28,092 --> 00:13:30,827
No response. Nothing.

221
00:13:30,829 --> 00:13:32,796
He won't talk to anyone.

222
00:13:32,798 --> 00:13:35,298
Never has, but...

223
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:38,368
I think he might speak
with you.

224
00:13:38,370 --> 00:13:41,104
So, why don't you sit down
with him

225
00:13:41,106 --> 00:13:46,643
