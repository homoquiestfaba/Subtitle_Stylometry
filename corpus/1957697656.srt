1
00:00:01,048 --> 00:00:03,310
- As you relax in shavasana

2
00:00:04,512 --> 00:00:06,720
feel the heaviness of your bones

3
00:00:08,201 --> 00:00:12,346
notice your muscles releasing their tension

4
00:00:12,666 --> 00:00:15,352
let your body sink into the floor.

5
00:00:16,484 --> 00:00:19,051
Today quote is from Albert Einstein:

6
00:00:19,888 --> 00:00:23,184
"The world we have created is
the product of our thinking,

7
00:00:24,011 --> 00:00:27,310
it cannot be changed without changing our thinking"

8
00:00:36,012 --> 00:00:40,692
- So, it's between a fix over daddy and a Tom's last jock.

9
00:00:40,692 --> 00:00:44,694
Daddy is the first top,
jock is the first bum.

10
00:00:45,251 --> 00:00:46,931
What do you think?
- Gross.

11
00:00:48,319 --> 00:00:51,672
- You're so picky. 
You'll never get laid with that attitude.

12
00:00:51,672 --> 00:00:54,019
- I'm not trying to get laid with that trash up.

13
00:00:54,192 --> 00:00:56,766
- Where're you going anyway?
- Yoga.

14
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:00,148
- Thanks for the invite.
- If you wanna go...?

15
00:01:00,779 --> 00:01:03,910
- No, I'm... too horny now.

16
00:01:04,237 --> 00:01:06,081
- Okay, good luck man.

17
00:01:24,223 --> 00:01:25,659
- Welcome everyone.

18
00:01:25,685 --> 00:01:28,127
Thank you for join me tonight.
My name is Troy.

19
00:01:28,923 --> 00:01:30,449
Let's begin child's pose

20
00:01:34,805 --> 00:01:36,650
Be in touch into your breath

21
00:01:37,768 --> 00:01:42,285
to your rib cage expanding and contracting

22
00:01:42,368 --> 00:01:46,046
and now let's move from our warrior one
into our warrior two

23
00:01:46,046 --> 00:01:48,648
with you arms at the opposite side of the room.

24
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:51,847
Really reach, keep it in level

25
00:01:52,884 --> 00:01:54,191
spine straight,

26
00:01:54,893 --> 00:01:56,467
rise your face,

27
00:01:57,333 --> 00:01:58,635
maybe smile,

28
00:01:59,293 --> 00:02:01,708
yoga don't have to be so dead serious.

29
00:02:04,275 --> 00:02:07,585
Alright, now your exist is moving to our flow.

30
00:02:09,871 --> 00:02:12,152
- Thank you very much
- Of course, thank you

31
00:02:14,070 --> 00:02:16,793
- Thank you
 - Thanks so much, see you next week

32
00:02:21,624 --> 00:02:23,299
- Thank you so much
- Of course

33
00:02:23,426 --> 00:02:25,947
- I've a little bit of pain in my shoulders
- Oh

34
00:02:26,350 --> 00:02:29,738
- I'm doing my part against it
- Yeah, okay

35
00:02:29,929 --> 00:02:35,013
Well next time I'll show you a modification
that you can do anyhow...thank you...

36
00:02:35,013 --> 00:02:37,975
that you won't have to twist...

37
00:02:37,999 --> 00:02:40,133
but if you feel that don't push it.

38
00:02:40,157 --> 00:02:42,633
Everyone avoid jeopardy in a practice and

39
00:02:42,657 --> 00:02:45,219
we do wont you to have to quit, so

40
00:02:45,243 --> 00:02:47,577
take it easy, okay?- Thank you.

41
00:02:48,834 --> 00:02:50,014
- Hi
- Hi

42
00:02:50,038 --> 00:02:52,038
- Really good today
- Thanks.

43
00:02:52,544 --> 00:02:54,102
Troy, right?
- Hu

44
00:02:54,371 --> 00:02:56,736
- I'm Nick
- Nice to meet you Nick

45
00:02:57,239 --> 00:03:00,922
Hope to see you again soon
- Oh, yeah...you too.

46
00:03:02,503 --> 00:03:05,770
We'll see Giddens instructions on
how to operate in the world.

47
00:03:05,904 --> 00:03:09,125
Remember, wide spread instruction 
out there is actually culture

48
00:03:09,221 --> 00:03:12,395
and the problem with culture is that is a fiction

49
00:03:12,395 --> 00:03:15,792
is the product of imagination of often disturbed minds.

50
00:03:16,321 --> 00:03:18,540
It has nothing to do with science.

51
00:03:41,191 --> 00:03:44,527
- Hey Nick, right?
- Yes

52
00:03:44,815 --> 00:03:46,215
Hi
- Hi

53
00:03:46,519 --> 00:03:49,648
Are you coming for a class?
I've just finished my last one for the day

54
00:03:49,648 --> 00:03:51,932
- No, I was just passing. I study here, nearby

55
00:03:52,587 --> 00:03:54,029
- Hm, NYU?
- Hu, hu

56
00:03:55,116 --> 00:03:57,736
- Lots of NYU kids go to my classes
- Yeah?

57
00:03:57,745 --> 00:03:59,301
- Yoga is a thing now

58
00:04:00,937 --> 00:04:04,494
- It's kind of being a thing 
for thousands of years already

59
00:04:04,519 --> 00:04:07,848
- Right. I just mean on the Western Side 
is super trendy now

60
00:04:07,958 --> 00:04:10,149
even my grandmother practices.

61
00:04:11,588 --> 00:04:13,838
- You wanna go and get a drink, Nick?

62
00:04:14,010 --> 00:04:15,704
If you're not to busy studying?

63
00:04:15,704 --> 00:04:18,455
- No, not at all. I'm done for the day.

64
00:04:21,366 --> 00:04:23,046
- I'm just so inflexible

65
00:04:23,136 --> 00:04:25,487
It will take me years
to do asana properly

66
00:04:25,835 --> 00:04:27,928
- Yoga is not about flexibility

67
00:04:28,652 --> 00:04:30,046
- What is about?

68
00:04:30,186 --> 00:04:32,406
- It's about balancing your mind and body

69
00:04:32,686 --> 00:04:35,045
Keep them in peace with one another

70
00:04:36,966 --> 00:04:39,433
Find equilibrium in your breath

71
00:04:41,262 --> 00:04:45,620
Sound like the simplest thing in the world
but it's so difficult to achieve

72
00:04:49,590 --> 00:04:52,605
You had some foam on your lips.
- Thanks

73
00:04:53,288 --> 00:04:56,402
And your...your lips...have some stains from the wine

74
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:59,265
- Wine is a natural lipstick

75
00:05:02,809 --> 00:05:04,822
- Oh, it was really nice talking to you, Nick

76
00:05:04,855 --> 00:05:06,707
- See you at the studio soon?
- Yeah

77
00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:09,903
- Give me a hug, you boy.

78
00:05:12,762 --> 00:05:14,047
Take care, right?

79
00:05:48,270 --> 00:05:49,757
- You wanna make out?

80
00:05:50,903 --> 00:05:52,425
- We're friends

81
00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:56,982
- We can be friends with willy's tits...
- No, thanks

82
00:05:57,723 --> 00:06:00,969
- Can we jerk off at least?
- Ricky, don't be a perv!

83
00:06:01,517 --> 00:06:03,876
- You cute boys are too complicated

84
00:06:03,876 --> 00:06:05,986
You're even beautiful but dumb,

85
00:06:05,986 --> 00:06:10,063
but in your case beatiful but asexual.

86
00:06:10,759 --> 00:06:13,824
One miss a love...
- Fuck off.

87
00:06:15,863 --> 00:06:21,013
- ...through analysis, research and investigation
to arrive at our conclusions.

88
00:06:21,349 --> 00:06:25,974
To keep your mind clear of bias, it's important
to have some distance from your subject,

89
00:06:25,974 --> 00:06:28,745
now by that I mean that...

90
00:06:36,299 --> 00:06:39,396
...social norms of the 20 century
have nothing to do...

91
00:06:42,548 --> 00:06:45,730
...social norms and institutions should be at least two pages long

92
00:06:45,770 --> 00:06:48,234
and I will see you next week, students.

93
00:06:57,338 --> 00:07:02,198
- Makes you really, really reach on the side and I know... that...

94
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:09,392
keep squaring your hips...good, good, good...great

95
00:07:15,845 --> 00:07:18,797
All right everyone, We're gonna go on our three pose

96
00:07:18,797 --> 00:07:22,870
So, bring your foot above your knee 
oblique on your thigh,

97
00:07:22,870 --> 00:07:24,810
you need to adjust with your hand for quick find

98
00:07:24,810 --> 00:07:27,784
and then raise your arms up

99
00:07:28,510 --> 00:07:30,190
like that...strong tree.

100
00:07:31,486 --> 00:07:32,618
Good

101
00:07:33,102 --> 00:07:34,143
Good

102
00:07:39,734 --> 00:07:43,702
- It feel like my left side is tighten
at my right. Did you notice that?

103
00:07:44,059 --> 00:07:48,855
- Thanks so much. I did. But...I...
Thank you so much.

104
00:07:49,198 --> 00:07:53,360
- But you're doing really good work.
Don't, don't worry about that.

105
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:55,481
- Thank you
- Next time just try and breathe

106
00:07:55,481 --> 00:07:58,240
your energy enter into that space
 where awareness...nonetheless...

107
00:08:02,018 --> 00:08:04,003
- What is with him?

108
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:28,942
- Okay, what's up with painting nails?

109
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:31,122
- Is that a real question?

110
00:08:33,011 --> 00:08:34,306
Seriously?

111
00:08:34,646 --> 00:08:37,652
It's fun, it's creative, it's queer.

112
00:08:38,065 --> 00:08:40,031
Just a way to express myself

113
00:08:40,287 --> 00:08:41,950
You should try sometime.

114
00:08:43,685 --> 00:08:45,163
- How about now?

115
00:08:47,369 --> 00:08:51,774
- Okay. I've a pick or black?
- Black

116
00:08:51,774 --> 00:08:54,785
- You're so uptight but...
it's a start.

117
00:09:09,785 --> 00:09:11,217
- You are so...

118
00:09:14,779 --> 00:09:16,517
not yourself tonight.

119
00:09:17,031 --> 00:09:18,655
Is everything all right?

120
00:10:27,538 --> 00:10:30,887
- Sorry. Ehy Nick! Hi!

121
00:10:32,056 --> 00:10:35,092
- Hey guys!
- He...hi cutie

122
00:10:35,921 --> 00:10:37,793
- Kristin, this is Nick

123
00:10:38,020 --> 00:10:40,346
He studies psychology at NYU

124
00:10:41,593 --> 00:10:43,381
- Actually, it's sociology

125
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:46,241
- Sociology...right.

126
00:10:47,371 --> 00:10:50,637
Nick, this is Kristin. She is 
a trainee in one of our studios

127
00:10:50,737 --> 00:10:54,247
She's gonna be teacher
in just 200 hours of practice

128
00:10:55,022 --> 00:10:56,432
- It's nice to meet you,hmm..

129
00:10:56,855 --> 00:10:59,077
I saw you in class yesterday, you'very...

130
00:10:59,886 --> 00:11:02,731
flexible
- Thanks...but...

131
00:11:03,509 --> 00:11:06,017
yoga is not abou flexibility

132
00:11:06,369 --> 00:11:07,386
- Of course.

133
00:11:10,102 --> 00:11:11,885
Ehm...excuse me I...I...ah..

134
00:11:12,336 --> 00:11:14,105
I have other studying to do today

135
00:11:14,353 --> 00:11:15,451
- Sure

136
00:11:15,743 --> 00:11:17,023
NYU after all...

137
00:11:18,113 --> 00:11:19,492
See you at the studio, Nick.

138
00:11:20,062 --> 00:11:21,057
- See you

139
00:11:22,122 --> 00:11:23,065
- Hey Nick

140
00:11:24,672 --> 00:11:29,311
- Love the nails. Very edgy.
- Thanks

141
00:11:29,959 --> 00:11:31,298
- Life is a paradoxe,

142
00:11:31,406 --> 00:11:33,499
often it doesn't see to make any sense but

143
00:11:33,499 --> 00:11:35,179
our job is to find some.

144
00:11:35,415 --> 00:11:39,263
Through researches and analysis
we explain social phenomenons

145
00:11:39,271 --> 00:11:42,170
and find answers to most confusing questions.

146
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:44,807
Take conservative America for example,

147
00:11:45,005 --> 00:11:46,535
For liberal New York,

148
00:11:46,709 --> 00:11:49,174
this part of the country is often a mistery

149
00:11:49,703 --> 00:11:54,537
In her book Arlie Hochschild talks about the field
of liberal views that goes like this...

150
00:12:57,050 --> 00:12:58,049
- Hello

151
00:12:58,260 --> 00:12:59,273
Hey

152
00:13:05,180 --> 00:13:06,416
Ouch...

153
00:13:06,873 --> 00:13:08,929
--------
- Me

154
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:11,943
- Why?
- You

155
00:13:21,670 --> 00:13:23,190
- This is...heem...

156
00:13:24,468 --> 00:13:26,148
ah...quite amusing...

157
00:14:59,024 --> 00:15:01,680
- A girl? Seriously?

158
00:15:02,787 --> 00:15:04,467
- Gender is just a cat strap

159
00:15:18,057 --> 00:15:20,442
- Try working out your calves and...

160
00:15:20,904 --> 00:15:22,402
Nick

161
00:15:23,948 --> 00:15:25,192
Welcome

162
00:15:26,084 --> 00:15:30,134
...just try stretching them up like...
but don't, don't push it to the bottom

163
00:15:38,851 --> 00:15:41,037
- Hey Nick
- Oh, hi Kristin

164
00:15:41,037 --> 00:15:43,610
- All right everyone, let's begin in child's pose

165
00:15:54,035 --> 00:15:55,737
Lift your hips up

166
00:15:56,121 --> 00:15:59,776
Fit your palms pressing into the ground

167
00:15:59,803 --> 00:16:03,432
come upwards into a warrior one

168
00:16:14,963 --> 00:16:17,166
As you relax in shavasana

169
00:16:17,166 --> 00:16:19,765
feel the heaviness of your bones

170
00:16:20,371 --> 00:16:24,618
Notice your muscles releasing their tension

171
00:16:25,122 --> 00:16:27,634
Let your body sink into the floor

172
00:16:28,977 --> 00:16:31,304
Today quote is from Albert Einstein:

173
00:16:32,324 --> 00:16:35,534
"The world we've created is
the product of our thinking

174
00:16:36,539 --> 00:16:39,809
it cannot be changed without changing our thinking"

175
00:16:40,445 --> 00:16:43,420
This quote reminds me that all is mind.

176
00:16:44,392 --> 00:16:48,175
Often we forget it and we treat
our thoughts and imagination as some

177
00:16:48,594 --> 00:16:51,662
