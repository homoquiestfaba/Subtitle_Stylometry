1
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:16,945
(instrumental
theme music plays)

2
00:02:16,903 --> 00:02:19,098
(inmates yelling, jeering)

3
00:02:28,882 --> 00:02:31,715
(jeering continues)

4
00:02:38,124 --> 00:02:41,457
Inmate's voice: Looking back on
it now, I should've seen it coming.

5
00:02:44,364 --> 00:02:47,492
I thought we had it
all figured out...

6
00:02:47,567 --> 00:02:49,262
we had the money...

7
00:02:49,335 --> 00:02:51,963
we had the connections.

8
00:02:52,038 --> 00:02:53,972
This deal, we were
going to be players.

9
00:03:34,847 --> 00:03:37,315
What are you
tripping on, Paulie?

10
00:03:39,352 --> 00:03:41,786
I ain't tripping.

11
00:03:41,854 --> 00:03:43,685
What the fuck
you mean, "tripping"?

12
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:49,860
You're looking tense.
Don't worry about it.

13
00:03:49,929 --> 00:03:52,625
Everything's going
to be cool.

14
00:03:52,699 --> 00:03:55,259
I know, man.
I'm fucking cool.

15
00:03:58,371 --> 00:04:00,134
Tell me about these guys.

16
00:04:00,206 --> 00:04:02,071
Don't worry about that.

17
00:04:02,141 --> 00:04:03,904
These guys are major league.

18
00:04:03,977 --> 00:04:05,911
Just make sure
your people are cool,

19
00:04:05,979 --> 00:04:08,504
because these dudes
do not fuck around.

20
00:04:08,581 --> 00:04:10,606
(metal rattles)

21
00:04:12,652 --> 00:04:15,018
Fucking rat.

22
00:04:16,990 --> 00:04:19,083
Are you sure you're okay?

23
00:04:19,158 --> 00:04:21,854
I'm fucking cool. Why?

24
00:04:23,162 --> 00:04:25,528
You got the money, right?

25
00:04:28,501 --> 00:04:30,935
Yeah. Yeah.

26
00:04:33,172 --> 00:04:35,106
Rooster's got it...

27
00:04:35,174 --> 00:04:36,937
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Who? What?

28
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:40,104
- Rooster? That psycho fuck?
- Calm down, Slim.

29
00:04:40,179 --> 00:04:43,774
You know I don't like dealing
with that psycho fuck.

30
00:04:43,850 --> 00:04:47,946
- Don't worry.
- Bullshit, "Don't worry."

31
00:04:48,955 --> 00:04:51,150
He's going to be here
any second.

32
00:04:51,224 --> 00:04:53,954
- All right?
- Where the fuck is he?!

33
00:04:54,027 --> 00:04:55,961
Any second.

34
00:04:56,029 --> 00:04:59,556
Well, he better be,
because it's down time.

35
00:04:59,632 --> 00:05:01,691
(knocking)

36
00:05:10,143 --> 00:05:11,735
- Hey, Tay.
- What's up, Slim?

37
00:05:11,811 --> 00:05:14,405
What up with your boy?
I don't like meeting new niggas.

38
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:16,744
Maybe I don't want
to fucking meet this toad.

39
00:05:16,816 --> 00:05:19,910
I'm the fucking money
in this, man.

40
00:05:19,986 --> 00:05:21,920
What the fuck do you think
you're pointing at?

41
00:05:21,988 --> 00:05:23,922
I'm the fucking man
that makes it happen.

42
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:25,924
Tay: We don't get down
like that, man.

43
00:05:25,992 --> 00:05:28,256
You'll have
to excuse my partner.

44
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:30,888
He has a nasty habit
of talking out of his asshole.

45
00:05:30,963 --> 00:05:32,726
What the fuck, Slim?

46
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:35,359
You ever get my product?

47
00:06:07,967 --> 00:06:09,559
- Tay: Mm-hmm.
- Slim: Mm-hmm.

48
00:06:09,635 --> 00:06:12,069
- You know how we do it.
- Slim: This is the shit.

49
00:06:12,138 --> 00:06:14,504
Nothing but A-1.

50
00:06:15,641 --> 00:06:17,905
So, check it out.
Where's the money at?

51
00:06:17,977 --> 00:06:20,502
Well...

52
00:06:21,814 --> 00:06:23,907
What's up, playboy?
Where's the money at?

53
00:06:23,983 --> 00:06:25,917
It's gonna be here
in a second, man.

54
00:06:25,985 --> 00:06:29,011
- The guy's gonna...
- Aw, shit.

55
00:06:29,989 --> 00:06:32,423
Listen, I thought the money
was going to be here too,

56
00:06:32,492 --> 00:06:34,585
but there's been
a little bit of a glitch.

57
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:37,857
But don't worry.
It's gonna be here any second.

58
00:06:38,498 --> 00:06:40,432
The fucking guy...

59
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:42,434
I've known the guy
all my life.

60
00:06:42,502 --> 00:06:44,436
- He's gonna be here.
- Just be cool.

61
00:06:44,504 --> 00:06:46,438
I'll stake my life
on it, man.

62
00:06:46,506 --> 00:06:49,339
- The guy's...
- You just did.

63
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:52,207
Slim: Come on, why don't
we just settle down, guys?

64
00:06:52,278 --> 00:06:54,610
- (knocking)
- Get the door, Paulie.

65
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:57,547
Get the fucking door!

66
00:07:07,126 --> 00:07:10,994
It's Rooster. All right?
You got it, right?

67
00:07:22,475 --> 00:07:25,501
What did I say?
My boy Rooster comes through.

68
00:08:02,448 --> 00:08:06,646
Freeze! Hey!
Freeze, don't move!

69
00:08:14,126 --> 00:08:16,060
Slim's voice:
This was big.

70
00:08:16,128 --> 00:08:18,392
Bigger than all of us.

71
00:08:18,464 --> 00:08:21,331
And I was going down.

72
00:08:28,841 --> 00:08:31,469
(inmates yelling)

73
00:08:39,485 --> 00:08:41,419
What do we got here, Jack?

74
00:08:41,487 --> 00:08:43,421
Jack: We got
a regular cowboy here.

75
00:08:43,489 --> 00:08:46,083
This one's a serious operator.

76
00:08:46,158 --> 00:08:48,251
A real fucking Einstein, huh?

77
00:08:48,327 --> 00:08:50,887
Yeah, I've wanted to take
this punk down for a while.

78
00:08:50,963 --> 00:08:53,830
I'll get with the D.A. And see
how he wants to handle this.

79
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:55,925
All right.
I'll catch up with you later.

80
00:08:56,002 --> 00:08:59,597
One more like him, Jack,
and you'll be bucking for captain.

81
00:08:59,672 --> 00:09:02,038
I'm just doing my job.
You know how it is.

82
00:09:02,108 --> 00:09:05,805
It looks like "Einstein"
is in for a real ride.

83
00:09:08,447 --> 00:09:11,314
All right, cowboy,
get the fuck up.

84
00:09:11,951 --> 00:09:15,216
Then they stick me in this room
with this DEA creepy fuck,

85
00:09:15,288 --> 00:09:18,553
trying to grill me.

86
00:09:18,624 --> 00:09:21,718
Like I was going
to break weak with this fool.

87
00:09:21,794 --> 00:09:24,058
He was clueless.

88
00:09:24,130 --> 00:09:26,394
They had no idea
what really went down.

89
00:09:26,465 --> 00:09:28,956
Agent: Come on, Williams,
make it easy for yourself.

90
00:09:29,035 --> 00:09:31,833
Slim: They kept trying to get me
to confess to something.

91
00:09:31,904 --> 00:09:34,873
I got nothing to say
to you guys.

92
00:09:40,813 --> 00:09:43,247
You aren't looking
so good, Williams.

93
00:09:43,316 --> 00:09:47,514
What's wrong?
Feeling sick, huh?

94
00:09:48,821 --> 00:09:51,016
I bet you're starting to feel

95
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:53,490
like you want a little dope
right about now, huh?

96
00:09:53,559 --> 00:09:56,084
We can take care of that.

97
00:09:57,229 --> 00:09:59,060
Fuck you.

98
00:09:59,131 --> 00:10:01,326
You think you're real tough,
don't you?

99
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:07,498
You ain't gonna be so tough when
some nigger is going up your ass.

100
00:10:10,676 --> 00:10:13,941
Get out of here.
You make me sick.

101
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:28,984
(screams, sobbing)

102
00:11:09,368 --> 00:11:12,860
(inmates yelling)

103
00:11:25,184 --> 00:11:27,448
Guards! Guards!

104
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:31,286
You better get this sick
motherfucker out of my cell!

105
00:11:31,357 --> 00:11:33,825
Aw, motherfucker!

106
00:11:36,028 --> 00:11:37,359
Get the fuck up!

107
00:11:39,865 --> 00:11:43,562
You better get this asshole
out of here before I kill him!

108
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:50,907
Slim: I was so sick
I could barely walk.

109
00:11:51,877 --> 00:11:55,074
It seemed like forever
before I reached my cell.

110
00:11:58,050 --> 00:12:01,486
It was only when I stood
in front of that cell door

111
00:12:01,554 --> 00:12:05,115
that I realized my situation.

112
00:12:08,327 --> 00:12:12,286
In that moment,
the sickness left me...

113
00:12:13,666 --> 00:12:16,931
and the void was filled
with fear.

114
00:12:17,002 --> 00:12:20,062
It is truly amazing
how sobering fear can be.

115
00:12:30,049 --> 00:12:33,610
I was sick for weeks.
But I kept it to myself.

116
00:12:33,686 --> 00:12:36,655
I didn't want anybody
thinking I was weak.

117
00:12:37,690 --> 00:12:39,783
The whole time
I was jonesing,

118
00:12:39,859 --> 00:12:42,692
just thinking about how
this nightmare came down.

119
00:12:42,762 --> 00:12:46,926
Me, Gina and Paulie
were going to be players.

120
00:12:46,999 --> 00:12:51,026
But Paulie had fucked up
the biggest deal of our lives.

121
00:12:52,304 --> 00:12:54,499
The more I thought about it,

122
00:12:54,573 --> 00:12:57,906
the more I realized Paulie
was always a rat.

123
00:12:57,977 --> 00:13:00,810
It was just the first time
I got bit.

124
00:13:04,283 --> 00:13:07,309
I've been playing
this game so long,

125
00:13:07,386 --> 00:13:09,854
I was playing it
when you were in diapers,

126
00:13:09,922 --> 00:13:11,753
sucking on
your mama's titties.

127
00:13:11,824 --> 00:13:14,190
Come on. Show me
what you got, bro'.

128
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:16,194
Show me what you got.

129
00:13:16,262 --> 00:13:18,753
Yeah. Come with it.

130
00:13:18,831 --> 00:13:21,664
I've been playing
this game so damn long,

131
00:13:21,734 --> 00:13:24,328
I got the instructions
from Moses.

132
00:13:24,403 --> 00:13:26,166
Damn!

133
00:13:26,238 --> 00:13:28,001
Fuckers were playing
with wood.

134
00:13:28,073 --> 00:13:30,837
Let me show you
how to work it.

135
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:33,242
Show me what you got.

136
00:13:34,313 --> 00:13:35,974
Damn!

137
00:13:36,048 --> 00:13:39,108
(vocalizing rhythm)

138
00:13:40,853 --> 00:13:42,582
Damn!

139
00:13:45,691 --> 00:13:48,159
Uh-huh. Yeah.

140
00:13:48,227 --> 00:13:50,127
Get to that.

141
00:13:50,196 --> 00:13:51,686
(banging)

142
00:13:51,764 --> 00:13:54,324
What are you doing
back there in that corner?

143
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:56,732
- Go on, say it loud.
- (banging continues)

144
00:13:56,802 --> 00:14:00,203
Been in there far too long.
Far too long.

145
00:14:00,272 --> 00:14:02,297
You know what they say...

146
00:14:02,374 --> 00:14:05,036
"More than three shakes,
you're playing with yourself."

147
00:14:05,110 --> 00:14:07,510
(laughter)

148
00:14:09,582 --> 00:14:11,174
What's up?

149
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:12,911
Billy:
You done broke the law again.

150
00:14:12,985 --> 00:14:15,749
Sounds like one of you boys
would like to be shaking it for me.

151
00:14:15,821 --> 00:14:17,846
Excuse me, sir,
you dropped your dick.

152
00:14:17,923 --> 00:14:19,788
(laughter)

153
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:22,623
On account of your mama ain't here,
I thought you might help out.

154
00:14:22,695 --> 00:14:24,287
You got a mama?

155
00:14:24,363 --> 00:14:26,422
Big man: He got a mama.
I just got up off her.

156
00:14:26,498 --> 00:14:29,934
Hey, that's how motherfuckers
get their ass stuffed.

157
00:14:30,002 --> 00:14:33,199
I watch violence
day in and day out.

158
00:14:34,506 --> 00:14:37,100
People don't realize
that everyday civility

159
00:14:37,176 --> 00:14:40,612
we all take for granted...
it's a joke.

160
00:14:40,679 --> 00:14:44,080
I mean, you put men
in a cage...

161
00:14:44,149 --> 00:14:46,709
all that civility goes
out the window.

162
00:14:48,854 --> 00:14:53,223
What you got left
is a bunch of fucking animals.

163
00:14:53,926 --> 00:14:56,394
Break the bread, brother.

164
00:14:56,462 --> 00:14:58,589
Hey, man!

165
00:15:07,006 --> 00:15:08,769
Jump his ass!
Stomp him!

166
00:15:19,184 --> 00:15:20,913
White bread.

167
00:15:20,986 --> 00:15:23,420
I mean, it gets to you.

168
00:15:23,489 --> 00:15:27,755
It's bad enough when some
little punk gets fucked off,

169
00:15:27,826 --> 00:15:34,425
but when a big corn-fed motherfucker
starts squealing like a pig,

170
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:37,025
it does something to you, man.

171
00:15:40,839 --> 00:15:42,773
It fucks with your head.

172
00:15:42,841 --> 00:15:45,275
'Cause you know
if they can do him like that,

173
00:15:45,344 --> 00:15:48,973
what are they going to do
to your little dope-sick ass?

174
00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:55,111
It's just a matter
of time, right?

175
00:16:07,032 --> 00:16:09,728
(gates banging)

176
00:16:10,803 --> 00:16:12,737
One night,
the gates racked.

177
00:16:12,805 --> 00:16:16,070
A new guy was brought down
the tier.

178
00:16:16,141 --> 00:16:19,907
I knew this big fuck
was gonna be trouble.

179
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:21,571
He was a predator.

180
00:16:21,647 --> 00:16:24,844
I could tell he was sizing up
the situation.

181
00:16:26,151 --> 00:16:29,848
He was just trying to decide
who he was gonna take down.

182
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:40,093
This is how it always works.

183
00:16:40,165 --> 00:16:43,259
They just yell, "Man down."

184
00:16:43,335 --> 00:16:45,599
The guards come in
and cart them away.

185
00:16:45,671 --> 00:16:47,605
No questions asked.

186
00:16:47,673 --> 00:16:50,198
Man:
Look who they let out.

187
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:54,275
They bring in
a crazy motherfucker like that,

188
00:16:54,346 --> 00:16:57,213
it brings up the pressure
in the tank.

189
00:16:57,850 --> 00:17:00,284
This guy
was straight "5150."

190
00:17:00,352 --> 00:17:03,150
He was freaking
everybody out.

191
00:17:10,462 --> 00:17:12,726
I could tell he was just
trying to size me up

192
00:17:12,798 --> 00:17:15,926
to see if I was weak.

193
00:17:16,001 --> 00:17:19,732
By that time I'd been there
quite a while.

194
00:17:19,805 --> 00:17:22,535
I had what they called
the "Cadillac bunk."

195
00:17:23,809 --> 00:17:26,073
I think he was trying
to figure out

196
00:17:26,145 --> 00:17:29,080
if anybody was gonna
back my play.

197
00:17:29,148 --> 00:17:31,241
After dinner,
he made his move.

198
00:17:31,316 --> 00:17:33,841
(talking)

199
00:17:40,325 --> 00:17:42,850
Guard: Doors!

200
00:17:47,633 --> 00:17:49,396
What up, 'wood?

201
00:17:49,468 --> 00:17:52,335
- I ain't your 'wood.
- You're gonna be my bitch

202
00:17:52,404 --> 00:17:56,101
is what you're gonna be.
And I'm gonna take your shit.

203
00:17:56,175 --> 00:17:58,439
What the fuck
are you gonna do, huh?

204
00:17:58,510 --> 00:18:01,877
Do whatever you're going
to do, I guess.

205
00:18:20,299 --> 00:18:23,132
(inmates cheering)

206
00:18:26,105 --> 00:18:28,835
Inmate:
Fuck him up, Slim!

207
00:18:30,642 --> 00:18:32,576
When it happens,

208
00:18:32,644 --> 00:18:35,169
when you take him down...

209
00:18:36,148 --> 00:18:38,742
oh man.

210
00:18:38,817 --> 00:18:41,411
Something inside you...

211
00:18:41,487 --> 00:18:44,251
it's like you get this...
it's fucking amazing,

212
00:18:44,323 --> 00:18:48,225
you get this feeling
of exhilaration.

213
00:18:48,293 --> 00:18:50,022
You feel dominant.

214
00:18:50,095 --> 00:18:52,427
You feel powerful.

215
00:18:52,498 --> 00:18:55,092
It's almost erotic.

216
00:18:56,835 --> 00:18:59,531
After that,
things went pretty smooth.

217
00:19:00,839 --> 00:19:03,034
I got some respect.

218
00:19:04,109 --> 00:19:07,374
Oh, that sweet,
sweet scent.

219
00:19:07,446 --> 00:19:10,210
I can smell...
the doctor.

220
00:19:10,282 --> 00:19:12,216
You got something
there for me?

221
00:19:12,284 --> 00:19:13,649
Fredrickson?

222
00:19:13,719 --> 00:19:16,381
I know you got something
in there for me.

223
00:19:16,455 --> 00:19:17,820
Murphy!

224
00:19:17,890 --> 00:19:20,381
A little something
for my... throbbing.

225
00:19:20,459 --> 00:19:22,188
Furlough!

226
00:19:22,261 --> 00:19:24,889
Something in there
for me...

227
00:19:24,963 --> 00:19:28,729
Guard: Get back. Get your meds,
get the hell away from the bar.

228
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:31,234
Sorry, ma'am,
they're freaking animals.

229
00:19:31,303 --> 00:19:35,399
It's okay. I don't pay them
any attention.

230
00:19:35,474 --> 00:19:38,341
I'll give you my big bone.

231
00:19:41,313 --> 00:19:43,042
Damn.

232
00:19:46,151 --> 00:19:51,248
I knew he was going to have a
hard time the first time I saw him.

233
00:19:51,323 --> 00:19:54,292
He's what they call
"chicken"...

234
00:19:54,359 --> 00:19:56,623
fresh meat.

235
00:19:56,695 --> 00:20:00,358
And I could tell they were
particularly excited about him.

236
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:04,663
Pough:
Hey, baby. Hey, baby!

237
00:20:04,736 --> 00:20:07,671
Come on with that shit.
Hey, baby.

238
00:20:07,739 --> 00:20:10,435
Hey, baby!

239
00:20:10,509 --> 00:20:13,000
Mary had a little lamb...

240
00:20:18,684 --> 00:20:20,879
Find out what he did.

241
00:20:23,021 --> 00:20:27,287
So, whitey,
what are you in for?

242
00:20:27,359 --> 00:20:30,692
Stealing somebody's
lunch money, or what?

243
00:20:32,231 --> 00:20:33,960
I don't really...
(mumbling)

244
00:20:35,033 --> 00:20:37,866
Huh?
What did you say?

245
00:20:39,538 --> 00:20:42,405
Murder...
I'm in for murder.

246
00:20:42,474 --> 00:20:44,135
Murder!

247
00:20:44,209 --> 00:20:45,801
All:
Oh, no!

248
00:20:45,877 --> 00:20:48,141
We have us a regular
serial killer.

249
00:20:48,213 --> 00:20:50,579
(laughter)

250
00:20:51,383 --> 00:20:53,817
You can see
he's scared shitless.

251
00:20:53,885 --> 00:20:56,786
Billy, what's up? You want him
for your bitch or what?

252
00:20:56,855 --> 00:20:59,221
- You've been down too long.
- I've been down?

253
00:20:59,291 --> 00:21:02,055
I'm gonna have him down here
in a little while.

254
00:21:02,127 --> 00:21:05,096
That's what I'm gonna
have down for a long time.

255
00:21:05,163 --> 00:21:06,994
- Long time!
- Yeah! Come on!

256
00:21:07,065 --> 00:21:10,262
Come on out, baby.
We ain't gonna hurt you.

257
00:21:10,335 --> 00:21:13,236
We'll be nice to you.
Come on.

258
00:21:15,374 --> 00:21:18,275
Pough:
Tear that ass up!

259
00:21:18,343 --> 00:21:20,436
Billy ain't gonna babysit
your ass too long.

260
00:21:20,512 --> 00:21:22,275
You can run,
but you can't hide.

261
00:21:22,347 --> 00:21:24,713
- Word, Billy.
- That's right!

262
00:21:24,783 --> 00:21:26,648
Uh-huh.
I know.

263
00:21:32,190 --> 00:21:33,953
So what's up?

264
00:21:34,026 --> 00:21:36,392
Want to play?

265
00:21:37,596 --> 00:21:39,564
What?

266
00:21:39,631 --> 00:21:42,122
You talking to me?

267
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:44,725
Who do you think
I'm talking to?

268
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:51,305
Yeah, I'll play.
What are you guys playing?

269
00:21:51,376 --> 00:21:53,640
Hearts.

270
00:21:53,712 --> 00:21:55,145
I know how to play that.

271
00:21:55,213 --> 00:21:56,646
(laughter)

272
00:21:56,715 --> 00:21:58,148
I don't think you do.

273
00:21:58,216 --> 00:22:00,810
Sit down and we'll show you
how the game is played.

274
00:22:00,886 --> 00:22:03,354
Cool.

275
00:22:07,159 --> 00:22:10,424
- So what's your name?
- Johnny.

276
00:22:10,495 --> 00:22:13,225
So, "Johnny Boy"...

277
00:22:13,298 --> 00:22:17,598
who the fuck did you kill,
your babysitter?

278
00:22:17,669 --> 00:22:18,761
(laughter)

279
00:22:18,837 --> 00:22:21,465
Man, that's cold.

280
00:22:24,343 --> 00:22:30,043
Johnny, murder's a pretty
heavy rap. What happened?

281
00:22:32,017 --> 00:22:34,451
I was at the drive-in
with a buddy of mine,

282
00:22:34,519 --> 00:22:36,783
we were in his truck,

283
00:22:36,855 --> 00:22:39,289
and he had the stereo
cranked up real loud.

284
00:22:39,358 --> 00:22:41,451
We were all fucked up,
you know?

285
00:22:41,526 --> 00:22:45,292
And this big guy
just came out,

286
00:22:45,364 --> 00:22:48,356
told my friend to turn it down,
and he wouldn't.

287
00:22:48,433 --> 00:22:51,891
Then suddenly it was like
this guy snapped, you know?

288
00:22:51,970 --> 00:22:54,302
And he just started beating
my friend right in the face.

289
00:22:54,373 --> 00:22:59,811
Just whaling on him
over and over and over.

290
00:22:59,878 --> 00:23:02,369
And I had my blade,
you know,

291
00:23:02,447 --> 00:23:04,574
and I just wanted
to scare him.

292
00:23:04,649 --> 00:23:07,174
I didn't mean to...

293
00:23:09,154 --> 00:23:11,748
(stammering)
L-I didn't mean to do it.

294
00:23:12,724 --> 00:23:15,352
Shut up!

295
00:23:16,328 --> 00:23:18,592
Motherfucker's dead.

296
00:23:18,663 --> 00:23:22,929
That's it, and that's all.

297
00:23:23,001 --> 00:23:24,935
Save that crying shit
for the judge,

298
00:23:25,003 --> 00:23:27,267
- or I'll kick your...
- Knock it off, man.

299
00:23:27,339 --> 00:23:30,604
Pough: Don't be hurting
my baby down there.

300
00:23:31,676 --> 00:23:34,941
Johnny, listen up.

301
00:23:35,013 --> 00:23:36,605
You're in here now.

302
00:23:36,681 --> 00:23:39,673
You're gonna have to start
dealing with this shit.

303
00:23:39,751 --> 00:23:41,616
Now, pay attention.

304
00:23:41,686 --> 00:23:44,883
You don't have to do
nothing with Daddy.

305
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:50,453
Dude, you need
to put the "ugly" on.

306
00:23:50,529 --> 00:23:54,295
- What's that?
- The motherfucking ugly.

307
00:23:54,366 --> 00:23:58,962
You need to get an attitude or
your ass is going to get tore up.

308
00:23:59,037 --> 00:24:00,629
That's right.

309
00:24:00,705 --> 00:24:02,400
Guns, motherfucker!

310
00:24:02,474 --> 00:24:04,567
Big guns!

311
00:24:04,643 --> 00:24:07,237
I'm not into working out.

312
00:24:07,312 --> 00:24:10,145
- (laughter)
- Well, that may be,

313
00:24:10,215 --> 00:24:12,445
but it's better
than some sick bastard

314
00:24:12,517 --> 00:24:14,576
rooting around
up in your guts,

315
00:24:14,653 --> 00:24:16,985
if you know what I'm
talking about?

316
00:24:17,055 --> 00:24:20,513
All right.
Let's play.

317
00:24:31,670 --> 00:24:34,036
When they did
the evening count...

318
00:24:35,006 --> 00:24:39,375
he begged the guard to move him
to another cell block.

319
00:24:39,444 --> 00:24:41,139
I smell my little
white tender.

320
00:24:41,213 --> 00:24:42,976
(laughter)

321
00:24:43,048 --> 00:24:44,982
(inmates yelling)

322
00:24:45,050 --> 00:24:47,018
- How you doing?
- Johnny Boy!

323
00:24:47,085 --> 00:24:49,246
I told you, you're gonna
get it up in your ass!

324
00:24:49,321 --> 00:24:51,915
Let's do it!
Right here!

325
00:25:00,866 --> 00:25:03,164
The inevitable happened.

326
00:25:04,302 --> 00:25:07,328
Inside, all things
take their course.

327
00:25:08,139 --> 00:25:10,664
(Johnny howling)

328
00:25:21,486 --> 00:25:25,582
I can't describe the feelings that
went through me at that moment...

329
00:25:27,325 --> 00:25:31,386
but I do remember thinking,
"Better him than me."

330
00:25:34,332 --> 00:25:36,857
(sobbing)

331
00:26:04,996 --> 00:26:07,226
When Johnny-boy
took himself out like that,

332
00:26:07,332 --> 00:26:12,065
I started thinking about
the precious things in life.

333
00:26:12,137 --> 00:26:14,037
I started thinking
about Gina.

334
00:26:14,105 --> 00:26:16,630
(rock music plays)

335
00:27:14,132 --> 00:27:16,726
- Bitch.
- Williams, you have a visitor.

336
00:27:16,801 --> 00:27:19,497
Yeah, you idiot,
I'm talking to you.

337
00:27:20,639 --> 00:27:22,231
What the fuck
is his problem?

338
00:27:22,307 --> 00:27:24,571
It can't be a girlfriend.
It must be your mom.

339
00:27:24,643 --> 00:27:27,009
(laughter)

340
00:27:32,117 --> 00:27:34,813
This sucks

341
00:27:34,886 --> 00:27:37,286
This sucks

342
00:27:37,355 --> 00:27:38,913
This sucks!

343
00:27:49,067 --> 00:27:51,092
This sucks

344
00:27:51,169 --> 00:27:54,400
This sucks, this sucks
this sucks

345
00:27:54,472 --> 00:27:56,531
This sucks

346
00:27:56,608 --> 00:27:59,236
This sucks, this sucks

347
00:27:59,310 --> 00:28:01,244
This sucks.

348
00:28:06,384 --> 00:28:08,852
This sucks

349
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:11,616
This sucks

350
00:28:11,690 --> 00:28:14,090
This sucks

351
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:15,717
This sucks.

352
00:28:16,027 --> 00:28:19,485
They first came at me
with this deal for 20 years.

353
00:28:20,965 --> 00:28:24,332
I'm thinking to myself,
"What kind of deal is that?"

354
00:28:26,304 --> 00:28:28,238
I mean, they were trying
to break me.

355
00:28:28,306 --> 00:28:29,568
I knew it.

356
00:28:29,641 --> 00:28:33,577
They knew that I knew
that they knew it.

357
00:28:33,645 --> 00:28:36,341
You know.

358
00:28:37,315 --> 00:28:40,250
So the only option
was to wait them out.

359
00:28:40,318 --> 00:28:42,912
I told them that they
were gonna have to come at me

360
00:28:42,987 --> 00:28:45,080
with something better
than that,

361
00:28:45,156 --> 00:28:47,522
or I'm gonna go to trial.

362
00:28:48,827 --> 00:28:51,193
It's all part of the game.

363
00:28:53,498 --> 00:28:55,398
Pough:
What are you tripping on?

364
00:28:55,467 --> 00:28:58,436
Man, I'm thinking
about my family.

365
00:28:58,503 --> 00:29:01,597
- Mose: Oh, damn.
- I'm thinking about my wife...

366
00:29:03,108 --> 00:29:05,542
Don't go there, Billy.
Don't go there, bro'.

367
00:29:05,610 --> 00:29:07,544
I'm thinking
about my boy.

368
00:29:07,612 --> 00:29:11,708
- You got a boy, Billy?
- Oh, yeah, I got a boy.

369
00:29:11,783 --> 00:29:16,220
And I was thinking about the smile
that he gets on his face...

370
00:29:16,287 --> 00:29:19,723
Come on, man.
Let's go to sleep. Shit.

371
00:29:19,791 --> 00:29:23,887
- Billy: Beautiful smile.
- How you gonna go there?

372
00:29:23,962 --> 00:29:26,692
- You got to think...
- You can't do that, Billy.

373
00:29:26,765 --> 00:29:29,563
I'm thinking about
these motherfuckers...

374
00:29:29,634 --> 00:29:33,730
- Watching my back. Every damn day.
- Every day.

375
00:29:33,805 --> 00:29:37,366
While you're in here...
you got to think about them.

376
00:29:37,442 --> 00:29:39,239
You can't forget them.

377
00:29:39,310 --> 00:29:42,746
Mose: No, you can't do that.
I can't do that, man.

378
00:29:42,814 --> 00:29:45,009
Tell me about your family.

379
00:29:47,652 --> 00:29:49,586
Billy, you tripping.

380
00:29:49,654 --> 00:29:52,589
I got three kids,
beautiful fucking wife.

381
00:29:52,657 --> 00:29:56,593
Blessed, man!
Woman will follow me to the fire.

382
00:29:56,661 --> 00:29:59,425
But I got to live
in this motherfucker.

383
00:29:59,497 --> 00:30:01,590
I can't go there.

384
00:30:01,666 --> 00:30:04,260
I can't go there and survive
in this motherfucker.

385
00:30:04,335 --> 00:30:06,929
I'll tell you where
I'm gonna go, though.

386
00:30:07,005 --> 00:30:09,599
I'm gonna take
my motherfucking ass to sleep.

387
00:30:09,674 --> 00:30:12,370
Mose:
Fuck that shit, dude.

388
00:30:17,015 --> 00:30:20,451
I'm telling you, man, I'll never
forget this as long as I live.

389
00:30:20,518 --> 00:30:23,453
Me and my buddy, right,
we're in Washington D.C.

390
00:30:23,521 --> 00:30:25,614
We are tripping
our brains out,

391
00:30:25,690 --> 00:30:29,023
and we're being walked in the
central cell block... two white boys.

392
00:30:29,093 --> 00:30:33,359
They walk us into this cell...
it's me, my buddy

393
00:30:33,431 --> 00:30:36,958
and about 30 black guys on
the other side of the cell, right?

394
00:30:37,035 --> 00:30:39,629
When we walk in there,
the biggest,

395
00:30:39,704 --> 00:30:42,935
ugliest motherfucker of them
all looks across at us and says,

396
00:30:43,007 --> 00:30:46,773
"Oh, fresh, white meat."

397
00:30:46,845 --> 00:30:50,110
I about shit my pants
right then.

398
00:30:50,181 --> 00:30:52,046
But my buddy,
he don't miss a beat.

399
00:30:52,116 --> 00:30:54,016
He looks right at him
and says,

400
00:30:54,085 --> 00:30:56,053
"Fuck y'all niggers!

401
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:59,817
I don't pack shit... ain't none
of y'all niggers packing mine!"

402
00:30:59,891 --> 00:31:02,587
Man, I thought
we were dead meat right there.

403
00:31:02,660 --> 00:31:03,592
(laughter)

404
00:31:03,661 --> 00:31:06,186
Is today Tuesday?
It's Wednesday, huh?

405
00:31:07,665 --> 00:31:09,963
What the fuck does it
matter what day it is?

406
00:31:10,034 --> 00:31:13,435
If it's Wednesday,
it's "shit on a shingle" day.

407
00:31:13,504 --> 00:31:15,597
I can't believe
you guys eat that shit.

408
00:31:15,673 --> 00:31:19,040
Oh, man, "shit on a shingle"
is the fucking best.

409
00:31:35,193 --> 00:31:37,457
All right!
It is Wednesday!

410
00:31:37,528 --> 00:31:40,053
"Shit on a shingle."
Check it out.

411
00:31:41,532 --> 00:31:43,295
Slim: Shit.

412
00:31:43,368 --> 00:31:45,461
What's the matter,
you don't want yours?

413
00:31:45,536 --> 00:31:47,902
Slide it right on down.

414
00:31:51,209 --> 00:31:53,643
I still can't believe
you eat that shit.

415
00:31:53,711 --> 00:31:55,736
What are you
talking about, man?

416
00:31:55,813 --> 00:31:58,407
"Shit on a shingle"
is damn good.

417
00:32:00,218 --> 00:32:03,187
You don't want it?
Kick it on over here.

418
00:32:04,322 --> 00:32:06,847
Knock yourself out.

419
00:32:07,492 --> 00:32:09,926
Don't you know
"shit on a shingle" is brain food?

420
00:32:09,994 --> 00:32:12,758
Yeah, it gives you
shit for brains.

421
00:32:12,830 --> 00:32:15,697
Man, you're fucking crazy.
"Shit on a shingle..."

422
00:32:17,001 --> 00:32:19,026
that's the shit.

423
00:32:22,340 --> 00:32:25,207
They finally came at me
with a deal.

424
00:32:26,511 --> 00:32:28,877
Eight years.

425
00:32:29,514 --> 00:32:32,278
I knew it wasn't going
to get any better than that,

426
00:32:32,350 --> 00:32:34,716
so I took it.

427
00:32:35,687 --> 00:32:40,556
I was just happy to get out
of the madness of county jail.

428
00:32:42,026 --> 00:32:45,894
Go to prison,
get on with doing my time.

429
00:32:47,699 --> 00:32:49,792
Man: Whores.

430
00:32:49,867 --> 00:32:52,961
Those fucking whores.

431
00:32:53,037 --> 00:32:55,665
They all laughed at me.

432
00:32:58,376 --> 00:33:02,073
Those wicked little sinners.

433
00:33:02,146 --> 00:33:05,411
Thought they were
too good for me.

434
00:33:05,483 --> 00:33:07,747
I showed them...

435
00:33:07,819 --> 00:33:10,185
didn't I?

436
00:33:11,489 --> 00:33:13,582
I took it...

437
00:33:13,658 --> 00:33:16,525
and I made them like it.

438
00:33:19,664 --> 00:33:22,929
You're not laughing now,
are you?

439
00:33:23,001 --> 00:33:25,936
I killed you dead.

440
00:33:26,004 --> 00:33:29,440
I cut that nasty little cunt
up into pieces...

441
00:33:29,507 --> 00:33:33,068
Into little
bite-sized pieces.

442
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:37,875
Hey.

443
00:33:40,018 --> 00:33:42,885
They think they can stop me.

444
00:33:44,022 --> 00:33:46,547
But they're fools.

445
00:33:48,693 --> 00:33:50,786
These walls...

446
00:33:50,862 --> 00:33:52,989
these walls can't...

447
00:33:53,064 --> 00:33:56,124
stop me.

448
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:58,725
You want to know why?

449
00:34:09,313 --> 00:34:11,838
God loves me.

450
00:34:13,985 --> 00:34:16,852
God came and spoke to me.

451
00:34:19,490 --> 00:34:21,856
I do God's work.

452
00:34:24,495 --> 00:34:27,521
He made me who I am.

453
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:38,274
Son, do you know God?

454
00:34:38,342 --> 00:34:41,778
Fuck you! Get the fuck
out of my face!

455
00:34:41,846 --> 00:34:45,282
Take God into your heart
and He will set you free.

456
00:34:45,349 --> 00:34:49,285
Get the fuck out of my face.
He set you free, didn't he?

457
00:34:49,353 --> 00:34:52,789
So you can go out
and kill those women.

458
00:34:52,857 --> 00:34:54,950
Now get the fuck
away from me.

459
00:34:55,026 --> 00:34:57,551
Freak!

460
00:35:10,174 --> 00:35:11,971
It was bad enough
having to deal

461
00:35:12,043 --> 00:35:14,409
with the heat and smell
of my own stink,

462
00:35:14,479 --> 00:35:17,915
but those motherfuckers put me
in a holding cell with a maniac.

463
00:35:17,982 --> 00:35:21,349
This freak was a straight
serial killer.

464
00:35:48,012 --> 00:35:50,537
Hey, you know those women?

465
00:35:51,349 --> 00:35:54,045
The ones we've been
talking about?

466
00:35:55,019 --> 00:35:57,214
Those whores?

467
00:36:00,191 --> 00:36:05,219
God sent me down here
to deliver them from their sins.

468
00:36:05,296 --> 00:36:08,663
To rain righteousness
upon them.

469
00:36:11,135 --> 00:36:14,662
I'm sick of hearing you
muttering that shit.

470
00:36:15,806 --> 00:36:18,070
You're a real big man,
aren't you?

471
00:36:18,142 --> 00:36:20,838
Think you're a big man
'cause you killed them women?

472
00:36:20,912 --> 00:36:23,676
I ought to stomp
your ass right now.

473
00:36:24,482 --> 00:36:26,279
The Lord calleth me
to do His work.

474
00:36:26,350 --> 00:36:28,318
The Lord calleth me
to do His work.

475
00:36:28,386 --> 00:36:33,346
You shut the fuck up.
You close your mouth.

476
00:36:37,995 --> 00:36:40,361
Hey, buddy,
you play cards?

477
00:36:44,335 --> 00:36:46,803
The big day
had finally arrived.

478
00:36:46,871 --> 00:36:49,431
I was being transferred
to prison.

479
00:36:49,507 --> 00:36:52,772
I'd been in that cell
so long...

480
00:36:52,843 --> 00:36:56,472
I figured anything had to be
better than staying there.

481
00:36:59,517 --> 00:37:01,451
What are you in for?

482
00:37:01,519 --> 00:37:03,817
Drugs.

483
00:37:07,291 --> 00:37:09,657
What happened?

484
00:37:11,295 --> 00:37:13,855
I don't know.

485
00:37:13,931 --> 00:37:17,367
One moment I was
flying high as a kite,

486
00:37:17,435 --> 00:37:20,404
next moment, I was in here.

487
00:37:25,309 --> 00:37:28,210
I don't know what
I'm going to do now.

488
00:37:30,147 --> 00:37:32,843
I guess a lot of time.

489
00:37:44,495 --> 00:37:46,861
So, what's your name?

490
00:37:54,005 --> 00:37:56,269
Joe.

491
00:37:56,340 --> 00:37:58,331
My name is John.

492
00:38:03,781 --> 00:38:05,544
Let's go.

493
00:38:05,616 --> 00:38:08,141
Corner pocket.

494
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:05,307
Okay, you two gentlemen
over in the corner.

495
00:39:10,781 --> 00:39:13,147
Okay, let's go.

496
00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:17,314
Go ahead down to the van.

497
00:39:19,123 --> 00:39:21,489
Guard:
Let's go, you guys.

498
00:39:40,378 --> 00:39:43,836
Hey, homes, what's up with you
talking to that "toad," man?

499
00:39:43,914 --> 00:39:47,406
I don't know.
He's cool.

500
00:39:47,485 --> 00:39:50,079
- You ever been to the pen before?
- No.

501
00:39:50,154 --> 00:39:53,351
- How much time you bring?
- Eight years.

502
00:39:53,424 --> 00:39:57,588
Man, if you want to be a "reg"
or a "lop," it's on you.

503
00:39:57,661 --> 00:40:00,186
Those stand-up peckerwoods
are going to smoke,

504
00:40:00,264 --> 00:40:03,233
eat, drink, talk
after the "toad."

505
00:40:05,169 --> 00:40:07,603
- I see.
- That nigger's...

506
00:40:07,671 --> 00:40:09,764
Man, fuck you,
motherfucker!

507
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:12,206
I got your "nigger" over here,
motherfucker!

508
00:40:12,276 --> 00:40:14,244
I'll see you on the mainline.

509
00:40:14,311 --> 00:40:15,972
We'll see.

510
00:40:26,357 --> 00:40:28,621
(inmates jeering)

511
00:40:44,842 --> 00:40:46,571
Come on!

512
00:40:51,715 --> 00:40:54,309
"Sammytown" basically
gave me his blessing.

513
00:40:54,385 --> 00:40:56,979
He knew I was a stand-up
white dude.

514
00:40:57,054 --> 00:41:00,319
That made things a hell of a lot
easier right off the bat.

515
00:41:12,336 --> 00:41:15,601
Once I got to prison,
it was all about doing time...

516
00:41:15,673 --> 00:41:17,265
how to work the clock.

517
00:41:26,851 --> 00:41:30,446
I always wonder why they got
a plant in a smut magazine.

518
00:41:30,521 --> 00:41:33,547
It don't even match the upholstery,
you know what I'm saying?

519
00:41:33,624 --> 00:41:36,457
Slim: That is a nice plant, though.
I got to give her that.

520
00:41:36,527 --> 00:41:39,690
She's looking at him, she don't
even seem like she's enjoying him.

521
00:41:39,763 --> 00:41:42,960
- Where do you get those magazines?
- Same place your mother does.

522
00:41:43,033 --> 00:41:44,830
Don't talk about my mother.

523
00:41:44,902 --> 00:41:47,336
This guy looks a little bit
like John Wayne

524
00:41:47,404 --> 00:41:50,896
if you look at him
a certain way.

525
00:41:50,975 --> 00:41:53,375
That kind of reminds me...
the Duke is on Tv tonight.

526
00:41:53,444 --> 00:41:56,345
How many times
have you watched that show?

527
00:41:56,413 --> 00:41:58,779
I don't know.
20, at least.

528
00:41:58,849 --> 00:42:01,317
It seems to come on Tv
about five times a year.

529
00:42:01,385 --> 00:42:03,012
I'm down about a nickel now.

530
00:42:03,087 --> 00:42:07,080
Man, I thought I'd been
down a long time. Shit.

531
00:42:07,157 --> 00:42:09,148
You know, the Duke
is the best, man.

532
00:42:09,226 --> 00:42:13,128
He's got style.
He's all-American, is what he is.

533
00:42:13,197 --> 00:42:15,290
- Slim: Oh, yeah.
- Don't you think so?

534
00:42:15,366 --> 00:42:17,891
"All-American" what?

535
00:42:22,239 --> 00:42:24,503
So you was into smack
on the street?

536
00:42:24,575 --> 00:42:26,975
Oh, yeah.

537
00:42:27,044 --> 00:42:28,909
Big time.

538
00:42:28,979 --> 00:42:32,346
What kind of dope
they be doing in California?

539
00:42:32,416 --> 00:42:35,852
Are they into that
"Mexican Tar" stuff?

540
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:40,118
No, I bet they're into
that Chinese shit, huh?

541
00:42:40,190 --> 00:42:42,784
You know, the kind
that light a match

542
00:42:42,860 --> 00:42:44,691
and knock you on your ass.
Is that it?

543
00:42:44,762 --> 00:42:46,457
Yeah.

544
00:42:46,530 --> 00:42:49,021
Yeah, I'd like to try
that stuff sometime.

545
00:42:49,099 --> 00:42:52,262
I was into it all...
mostly Persian, though.

546
00:42:52,336 --> 00:42:55,737
- "Persian"? What the fuck is that?
- Dope from l-ran.

547
00:42:55,806 --> 00:42:58,639
If it comes from Iran,
why do they call it "Persian"?

548
00:42:58,709 --> 00:43:02,110
'Cause Iran
used to be "Persia."

549
00:43:02,179 --> 00:43:04,545
So? It ain't now,
is it?

550
00:43:04,615 --> 00:43:08,813
I don't know.
I guess it just sounds cooler.

551
00:43:08,886 --> 00:43:11,480
Oh, yeah.

552
00:43:12,156 --> 00:43:14,954
Oh, yeah, I heard
of that shit.

553
00:43:15,025 --> 00:43:17,255
Yeah, the "A-rabs"
be having that shit.

554
00:43:17,328 --> 00:43:19,922
And I think I knew
a couple of cats

555
00:43:19,997 --> 00:43:24,093
down in New Orleans
who was into that shit.

556
00:43:24,168 --> 00:43:25,965
They don't have that shit
over there.

557
00:43:26,036 --> 00:43:29,665
Yeah, they had that shit.
You don't think I'm connected?

558
00:43:29,740 --> 00:43:32,174
What the fuck...?

559
00:43:32,242 --> 00:43:36,702
I was the man.
Everybody had to come to me.

560
00:43:36,780 --> 00:43:40,113
- You don't believe me, do you?
- I believe you.

561
00:43:40,184 --> 00:43:41,981
You don't believe me
now, do you?

562
00:43:42,052 --> 00:43:46,182
- I believe you.
- I'm gonna show you.

563
00:43:46,256 --> 00:43:48,315
I believe you.

564
00:43:48,392 --> 00:43:49,950
- Yeah?
- Yeah, I believe you.

565
00:43:50,027 --> 00:43:53,463
I'm gonna come up with that shit.
What do you think about that?

566
00:43:53,530 --> 00:43:54,827
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

567
00:43:54,898 --> 00:43:56,763
You don't think
I can do it, do you?

568
00:43:56,834 --> 00:43:59,826
I can pull a few strings
and arrange a few things

569
00:43:59,903 --> 00:44:01,495
and have a few things
coming in here.

570
00:44:01,572 --> 00:44:02,834
- We'll see.
- You'll find out.

571
00:44:02,906 --> 00:44:06,398
Like a Mississippi gambler...
I got my hand in everything.

572
00:44:06,477 --> 00:44:08,445
- You'll find out.
- We'll see about that.

573
00:44:08,512 --> 00:44:10,377
I got the mud
under my fingernails

574
00:44:10,447 --> 00:44:12,278
I've been so close
to the Mississippi...

575
00:44:12,349 --> 00:44:15,341
Okay, all right.
Fuck it.

576
00:44:16,487 --> 00:44:19,581
We'll see. Proof is
in the pudding. Show me.

577
00:44:19,657 --> 00:44:22,023
What the fuck you talking
about "pudding" for?

578
00:44:22,092 --> 00:44:25,823
(muttering)
Shit... tapioca motherfucker.

579
00:44:27,231 --> 00:44:30,098
Slim: I was starting
to get used to the joint.

580
00:44:30,167 --> 00:44:32,965
I tell you, though,
it took a while

581
00:44:33,037 --> 00:44:35,835
to get over the shock
of being locked up.

582
00:44:37,074 --> 00:44:39,838
I remember walking
the tier one day

583
00:44:39,910 --> 00:44:43,710
thinking to myself,
"How the fuck did I get here?"

584
00:44:45,182 --> 00:44:47,082
But you get used to it,

585
00:44:47,151 --> 00:44:49,415
once you learn
how to play the game.

586
00:44:49,486 --> 00:44:52,478
And the game...
is cards.

587
00:44:52,556 --> 00:44:53,955
All right,
y'all in or not?

588
00:44:54,024 --> 00:44:56,925
I'm in this. Don't get
your drawers in a bunch.

589
00:44:56,994 --> 00:45:00,054
He don't wear no drawers.
You know how hillbillies are.

590
00:45:00,130 --> 00:45:03,497
Fuck you, who you calling hillbilly,
coon-ass motherfucker?

591
00:45:03,567 --> 00:45:05,262
- You, stupid.
- I may be stupid,

592
00:45:05,335 --> 00:45:07,326
but at least I'm happy.

593
00:45:07,404 --> 00:45:09,395
Yeah? Maybe you
should write a book...

594
00:45:09,473 --> 00:45:11,304
"How to be happy
but stupid."

595
00:45:11,375 --> 00:45:13,036
(all laugh)

596
00:45:13,110 --> 00:45:14,941
Is it true what they say
about you guys,

597
00:45:15,012 --> 00:45:17,071
like y'all are inbred
and fucking your sisters?

598
00:45:17,147 --> 00:45:20,674
Of course it is. Have you ever
seen a more inbred Mongoloid...

599
00:45:20,751 --> 00:45:22,651
Fuck you, Eddie!

600
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:26,451
I thought you were from Kentucky.
Isn't "Mongoloid" in China?

601
00:45:26,523 --> 00:45:28,957
It means he's retarded, Mario.

602
00:45:29,026 --> 00:45:32,154
That explains that
stupid-ass grin on his face.

603
00:45:32,229 --> 00:45:34,459
He's fucking retarded.

604
00:45:34,531 --> 00:45:37,125
I don't know who the fuck
you talking about, Eddie.

605
00:45:37,201 --> 00:45:39,260
Your coon-ass is
as inbred as mine is.

606
00:45:39,336 --> 00:45:42,271
You probably be mixing it up with
them 'gators down in them swamps.

607
00:45:42,339 --> 00:45:45,172
I've seen you in the visiting room
with that girl.

608
00:45:45,242 --> 00:45:47,233
I heard she's your sister.

609
00:45:47,311 --> 00:45:50,246
Come on, you can tell
"Uncle Mario" the truth.

610
00:45:50,314 --> 00:45:54,444
Damn, she's your sister?
Man, that's fucked up.

611
00:45:54,518 --> 00:45:58,181
- You were all up on her, too.
- She ain't my sister.

612
00:45:58,255 --> 00:46:00,086
That kid she has is yours.

613
00:46:00,157 --> 00:46:02,250
How could you go up
in your sister like that?

614
00:46:02,326 --> 00:46:06,126
- That bitch ain't my sister.
- That's not what I heard.

615
00:46:06,196 --> 00:46:11,156
I heard she's on the family visiting
list and your ass ain't married.

616
00:46:11,235 --> 00:46:13,795
Everybody be knowing
the only people

617
00:46:13,871 --> 00:46:15,395
that get on that
visiting list

618
00:46:15,472 --> 00:46:17,497
have to be a relative
or kinfolk.

619
00:46:17,574 --> 00:46:20,737
Come on, man...
she ain't my sister, okay?

620
00:46:20,811 --> 00:46:23,678
If she ain't your sister, who
is she? Your homie here just said...

621
00:46:23,747 --> 00:46:26,079
Coon-ass son of a bitch
ain't no homie of mine.

622
00:46:26,150 --> 00:46:27,742
Can we play
the fucking game?

623
00:46:27,818 --> 00:46:30,844
Hell, no... you ain't getting off
the hook that easy. Who is she?

624
00:46:30,921 --> 00:46:34,322
We ain't gonna play the fucking game
till you tell us who she is.

625
00:46:37,394 --> 00:46:42,422
All right, y'all really want
to know? She's my cousin. Okay?

626
00:46:42,499 --> 00:46:44,899
She's your cousin?

627
00:46:44,968 --> 00:46:48,597
She's my fucking cousin!
Can we play the fucking game?

628
00:46:48,672 --> 00:46:50,731
Oh, yeah, we can play
the fucking game, now.

629
00:46:50,808 --> 00:46:52,400
Assholes.

630
00:46:52,476 --> 00:46:54,944
- (all laughing)
- Fuck you guys.

631
00:46:57,114 --> 00:47:00,845
- Yo, Mario.
- Slim, what's up?

632
00:47:02,586 --> 00:47:04,554
- I can take care of that.
- Slim: Cool.

633
00:47:04,621 --> 00:47:07,283
- Make it a deuce.
- No problem.

634
00:47:07,357 --> 00:47:08,790
Catch you guys later.

635
00:47:08,859 --> 00:47:10,656
Are you going
to play cards with us?

636
00:47:10,727 --> 00:47:13,161
You don't want
to play cards with me.

637
00:47:13,230 --> 00:47:14,891
I'll just take
all your money.

638
00:47:14,965 --> 00:47:16,899
Listen to him.
Just sit down here.

639
00:47:16,967 --> 00:47:19,333
We'll show you
who's going to take who.

640
00:47:19,403 --> 00:47:23,305
I'd love to help you,
but I'm on a mission.

641
00:47:23,373 --> 00:47:25,000
- All right.
- See you guys later.

642
00:47:25,075 --> 00:47:27,703
Get your money
and come back, all right?

643
00:47:27,778 --> 00:47:30,246
Mario: So, Hillbilly, what's up
with you and them banks?

644
00:47:30,314 --> 00:47:31,975
How many did you say
you robbed?

645
00:47:32,049 --> 00:47:34,415
24.

646
00:47:34,484 --> 00:47:36,850
What do you mean,
"What's up with me and them banks?"

647
00:47:36,920 --> 00:47:39,889
You ain't exactly
no John Dillinger.

648
00:47:39,957 --> 00:47:43,290
How did you convince anybody
to give up the money?

649
00:47:43,360 --> 00:47:46,921
Anybody will give up the money
if you stick a gun in their face.

650
00:47:46,997 --> 00:47:51,331
No, man, you don't need
a fucking gun. It's in the attitude.

651
00:47:51,401 --> 00:47:52,925
With your skinny ass,
you're lucky

652
00:47:53,003 --> 00:47:55,335
the bitch didn't laugh you out
of the bank.

653
00:47:55,405 --> 00:47:57,566
No man, I just give her
the old "skunk eye."

654
00:47:57,641 --> 00:47:58,801
The what?

655
00:47:58,876 --> 00:48:02,277
The skunk eye. Ain't you never
heard of the skunk eye?

656
00:48:02,346 --> 00:48:04,473
No, why don't you hip us
to the "skunk eye"?

657
00:48:04,548 --> 00:48:06,641
What I'd do,

658
00:48:06,717 --> 00:48:09,777
I'd stroll into the bank
real cool-like,

659
00:48:09,853 --> 00:48:13,118
slide up to the teller,
hand the bitch a note.

660
00:48:13,190 --> 00:48:14,851
What did the note say?

661
00:48:14,925 --> 00:48:17,052
I'd write the same thing
on it every time.

662
00:48:17,127 --> 00:48:19,618
And what's that?

663
00:48:19,696 --> 00:48:21,425
"This is a bank robbery.
Don't make it a murder."

664
00:48:21,498 --> 00:48:24,126
That'll work.

665
00:48:24,201 --> 00:48:27,398
Then I'd go up and give her
the old skunk eye.

666
00:48:27,471 --> 00:48:30,099
(all laughing)

667
00:48:31,241 --> 00:48:33,641
Mario: That's pretty good.
Let me try that.

668
00:48:33,710 --> 00:48:37,271
"Hey, this is a bank robbery.
Don't make it a murder."

669
00:48:37,347 --> 00:48:39,611
(laughing)

670
00:48:39,683 --> 00:48:41,310
That's pretty good, man.

671
00:48:41,385 --> 00:48:44,582
And the beauty of it is,
it works every fucking time.

672
00:48:44,655 --> 00:48:47,055
Mario: You a crazy-ass
peckerwood, Hillbilly.

673
00:48:47,124 --> 00:48:49,922
"The old skunk eye"!

674
00:48:53,797 --> 00:48:55,492
So what are you doing here?

675
00:48:55,565 --> 00:48:57,760
Can't a guy visit
his old partner?

676
00:48:57,834 --> 00:49:01,326
- Ex-partner.
- Come on, man.

677
00:49:01,405 --> 00:49:05,671
I saw Gina
and she says, "Hey."

678
00:49:07,377 --> 00:49:10,744
That's real nice, you're
taking care of my girlfriend.

679
00:49:11,815 --> 00:49:14,807
Ex-girlfriend.

680
00:49:14,885 --> 00:49:16,978
Hey...

681
00:49:17,054 --> 00:49:19,648
you know I'll hook you up
when you get out, bro'.

682
00:49:19,723 --> 00:49:21,520
You know I'm good for it.

683
00:49:21,591 --> 00:49:25,584
Well, I don't need any help.
I can find my own women.

684
00:49:25,662 --> 00:49:28,392
Not for a while, though.

685
00:49:30,500 --> 00:49:32,491
I'm just kidding.

686
00:49:32,569 --> 00:49:36,164
Don't go get
all bitter, Slim.

687
00:49:36,239 --> 00:49:38,901
What the fuck
is this visit all about?

688
00:49:38,976 --> 00:49:40,944
I don't want any visitors.

689
00:49:41,011 --> 00:49:43,241
You know what it's about.

690
00:49:43,313 --> 00:49:45,907
You had the money.

691
00:49:47,451 --> 00:49:50,386
And all I want is my share,

692
00:49:50,454 --> 00:49:53,423
and I'll set up the deals.

693
00:49:53,490 --> 00:49:57,290
I'll give you your share
when you get out.

694
00:49:57,361 --> 00:50:00,159
You like to hold on to my stuff,
don't you, Paulie?

695
00:50:00,230 --> 00:50:02,790
You know you have it, Slim.

696
00:50:02,866 --> 00:50:05,300
I don't know what the fuck
you're talking about.

697
00:50:05,369 --> 00:50:08,031
The cops got it
when I got busted.

698
00:50:09,172 --> 00:50:11,333
They didn't mention anything

699
00:50:11,408 --> 00:50:14,241
about no 300 Gs in the trial.

700
00:50:14,311 --> 00:50:17,246
Maybe they didn't want
to report it to the IRS.

701
00:50:17,314 --> 00:50:19,077
You know these cops
are all corrupt.

702
00:50:19,149 --> 00:50:21,811
Yeah, I know about that.

703
00:50:22,686 --> 00:50:24,950
I know how you are, bro'.

704
00:50:25,022 --> 00:50:27,149
You're like me.

705
00:50:27,224 --> 00:50:30,091
I'm a con, you know?

706
00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:35,063
You wouldn't do that
to your old partner, would you?

707
00:50:35,132 --> 00:50:38,898
Like you wouldn't testify
against me, would you?

708
00:50:40,404 --> 00:50:43,805
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

709
00:50:43,874 --> 00:50:47,105
Listen, man,
I gotta go.

710
00:50:47,177 --> 00:50:50,613
Yeah, good fucking idea.
Get the fuck out of here!

711
00:50:52,315 --> 00:50:54,909
It was good to see Paulie

712
00:50:54,985 --> 00:50:57,783
'cause I was worried
about the money.

713
00:50:57,854 --> 00:51:00,948
But he made it clear
he didn't know jack.

714
00:51:07,697 --> 00:51:09,562
Thank you, shorty.

715
00:51:09,633 --> 00:51:12,363
Chingas tu madre, cabrón.

716
00:51:37,761 --> 00:51:41,288
(train rumbles)

717
00:52:32,315 --> 00:52:34,306
(train rumbles)

718
00:52:38,388 --> 00:52:40,083
(whistle whines)

719
00:53:26,770 --> 00:53:30,262
It's insidious how that shit
creeps back into your life.

720
00:53:30,340 --> 00:53:34,606
All the old excuses
come back.

721
00:53:35,879 --> 00:53:39,975
How quick you forget all the misery
it puts you through.

722
00:53:46,456 --> 00:53:49,016
You know what's
fucked up, Mario?

723
00:53:49,092 --> 00:53:52,084
No, Slim,
what's fucked up?

724
00:53:52,162 --> 00:53:55,097
I'm tripping on this shit.

725
00:53:55,165 --> 00:53:58,965
These days,
a fucking drug dealer

726
00:53:59,035 --> 00:54:00,969
gets more time
than a murderer.

727
00:54:01,037 --> 00:54:03,096
I mean, what kind
of shit is that?

728
00:54:03,173 --> 00:54:04,936
Tell me about it.

729
00:54:05,008 --> 00:54:07,533
My uncle killed his wife...
he served two years.

730
00:54:07,611 --> 00:54:09,511
You're kidding.
For murder?

731
00:54:09,579 --> 00:54:11,570
Yeah.

732
00:54:11,648 --> 00:54:15,709
Two years...
'cause after that

733
00:54:15,785 --> 00:54:17,719
they fried his ass
in the electric chair.

734
00:54:17,787 --> 00:54:20,847
(all laugh)

735
00:54:20,924 --> 00:54:23,449
Yo, man,
you got any smokes?

736
00:54:23,526 --> 00:54:26,256
Fuck, Mario, you've got
a whole pack there.

737
00:54:26,329 --> 00:54:27,921
What the hell are you
begging me for?

738
00:54:27,998 --> 00:54:30,660
That's my money.
I don't fuck with my money.

739
00:54:30,734 --> 00:54:33,066
I see how it is. I'm sitting
on these generic-ass smokes

740
00:54:33,136 --> 00:54:35,104
while you be sitting
fat on them humps.

741
00:54:35,171 --> 00:54:37,071
You can just suck my dick.

742
00:54:37,140 --> 00:54:39,108
Your ass don't be
smoking, no way.

743
00:54:39,175 --> 00:54:41,040
You just be chewing
on that nasty-ass shit.

744
00:54:41,111 --> 00:54:44,046
What's it matter to you
what I smoke or don't smoke?

745
00:54:44,114 --> 00:54:46,878
- I ain't the one begging.
- I ain't begging, fool,

746
00:54:46,950 --> 00:54:49,612
I just thought we were cool.
Here... I'll see you.

747
00:54:49,686 --> 00:54:53,144
I must be out of my fucking mind
to ask your tightwad ass for shit.

748
00:54:53,223 --> 00:54:54,383
Fuck you, Mario.

749
00:54:54,457 --> 00:54:56,652
Would you two
shut the fuck up?

750
00:54:56,726 --> 00:54:59,456
Here, man, let's play.

751
00:54:59,529 --> 00:55:00,757
Thank you.

752
00:55:03,600 --> 00:55:05,465
Hey, Eddie?

753
00:55:05,535 --> 00:55:09,733
I hear you got some more of them
books you've been getting in.

754
00:55:09,806 --> 00:55:12,741
No, I have the same old
tired books.

755
00:55:12,809 --> 00:55:15,471
- You've been holding out on me?
- You sly devil.

756
00:55:15,545 --> 00:55:17,012
He's holding out on us, Mario!

757
00:55:17,080 --> 00:55:19,139
The son of a bitch
is holding out.

758
00:55:19,215 --> 00:55:22,013
You act like you've never
seen no fuck book before,

759
00:55:22,085 --> 00:55:24,849
let alone some real pussy.

760
00:55:24,921 --> 00:55:28,379
Oh, yeah?
What about his sister?

761
00:55:28,458 --> 00:55:30,926
Fuck it, man. I told you guys
she's not my sister.

762
00:55:30,994 --> 00:55:33,087
If it wasn't for your sister
giving you some,

763
00:55:33,163 --> 00:55:34,755
you'd be getting
no pussy at all.

764
00:55:34,831 --> 00:55:37,265
Didn't they teach you
how to come up with the ladies?

765
00:55:37,334 --> 00:55:39,768
No. See, Hillbilly's
from the boondocks.

766
00:55:39,836 --> 00:55:42,202
In them hollers they ain't got
no real women.

767
00:55:42,272 --> 00:55:44,399
All they got
is their relatives.

768
00:55:44,474 --> 00:55:47,773
These dudes come up fucking
farm animals and shit.

769
00:55:47,844 --> 00:55:52,281
The first pussy ol' Kenny ever got
was a goddamn Holstein.

770
00:55:52,349 --> 00:55:54,613
Me? What about you?

771
00:55:54,684 --> 00:55:56,948
Why don't you tell these guys
what you told me

772
00:55:57,020 --> 00:55:59,454
about them chickens
up at your uncle's place?

773
00:55:59,522 --> 00:56:01,752
You two are serious
about this shit?

774
00:56:01,825 --> 00:56:04,487
You're a couple of sick
motherfuckers, you know that?

775
00:56:04,561 --> 00:56:07,496
Y'all never been
on a "heifer hunt."

776
00:56:08,098 --> 00:56:09,656
Nah, man.
What's that?

777
00:56:09,733 --> 00:56:12,566
I believe that is where
the whole crew goes out

778
00:56:12,635 --> 00:56:14,899
and they get real drunk
and then they go out

779
00:56:14,971 --> 00:56:18,065
and bag the ugliest bitch
in the bar, isn't that it?

780
00:56:18,141 --> 00:56:21,076
No.
A real heifer hunt.

781
00:56:21,144 --> 00:56:23,237
Y'all never been on one?

782
00:56:23,313 --> 00:56:26,077
No, man, what the fuck
is a "heifer hunt"?

783
00:56:26,149 --> 00:56:28,481
Well, it's when you
and your buddies...

784
00:56:28,551 --> 00:56:30,917
Hold up. This ain't about me.
This is about you.

785
00:56:30,987 --> 00:56:34,753
We don't be doing this shit in
Chicago like you backward-ass fucks.

786
00:56:34,824 --> 00:56:36,917
- Eddie: Let him finish.
- That's all right.

787
00:56:36,993 --> 00:56:38,927
We may be all backward
and all down there,

788
00:56:38,995 --> 00:56:41,190
but at least I ain't in here
for murdering some old lady.

789
00:56:41,264 --> 00:56:44,427
Shut the fuck up before
I go up in your skinny ass.

790
00:56:44,501 --> 00:56:46,765
That was an accident,
you motherfucker.

791
00:56:46,836 --> 00:56:49,669
Just finish the story,
Hillbilly.

792
00:56:50,840 --> 00:56:52,774
Okay.

793
00:56:52,842 --> 00:56:56,278
What we do, is we all gather
up in my pop's Dodge

794
00:56:56,346 --> 00:56:58,280
and head down
to the old McNilly place.

795
00:56:58,348 --> 00:57:02,250
You got to make sure to bring along
one of them baby sledgehammers...

796
00:57:02,318 --> 00:57:05,219
- What's the hammer for?
- Eddie: Shh.

797
00:57:05,288 --> 00:57:07,882
Now you got to do this shit
around midnight.

798
00:57:07,957 --> 00:57:11,723
'Cause that ol' bastard McNilly,
he be having a gauge.

799
00:57:11,795 --> 00:57:15,731
Y'all ever been hit with a buckshot?
Check this out, man.

800
00:57:15,799 --> 00:57:17,733
Come on.
Just tell the story.

801
00:57:17,801 --> 00:57:20,099
All right, man,
it ain't no big thing.

802
00:57:20,170 --> 00:57:22,866
You guys all act like
you never done this before.

803
00:57:22,939 --> 00:57:27,876
So what you got to do,
is you got to go up to them pens

804
00:57:27,944 --> 00:57:31,243
where they be keeping
them little calves penned up.

805
00:57:31,314 --> 00:57:33,043
You know them calves...

806
00:57:33,116 --> 00:57:36,574
they don't be having
no teeth.

807
00:57:36,653 --> 00:57:40,783
All you got to do
is whip it out...

808
00:57:40,857 --> 00:57:45,191
and goddamn, if them things
don't give the best head

809
00:57:45,261 --> 00:57:47,889
in the state of Kentucky!

810
00:57:47,964 --> 00:57:49,625
(laughter)

811
00:57:49,699 --> 00:57:53,465
- What's the hammer for?
- God damn it, is you stupid?

812
00:57:53,536 --> 00:57:57,768
That little thing thinks you're
the tit on its mama's udder.

813
00:57:57,841 --> 00:58:00,309
Shit man, It be trying
to suck your thing right off.

814
00:58:00,376 --> 00:58:03,812
You got to hit him pretty good
if you want to get him off.

815
00:58:05,114 --> 00:58:07,844
Sometimes he just be sucking
and sucking.

816
00:58:07,917 --> 00:58:09,976
You keep on hitting
and hitting it...

817
00:58:10,053 --> 00:58:11,884
I can't believe
this shit.

818
00:58:11,955 --> 00:58:14,219
...it doesn't
want to let go.

819
00:58:14,290 --> 00:58:16,554
I heard of some sick shit
in my life,

820
00:58:16,626 --> 00:58:18,560
but that takes
the fucking cake.

821
00:58:18,628 --> 00:58:20,562
Don't knock it
till you try it.

822
00:58:20,630 --> 00:58:22,393
I haven't tried
suicide either, but...

823
00:58:22,465 --> 00:58:24,990
I'll help you out
with that.

824
00:58:32,475 --> 00:58:35,000
(Spanish music playing)

825
00:58:48,658 --> 00:58:50,592
- What's up, man?
- What's up?

826
00:58:50,660 --> 00:58:52,753
We got some shit coming in.

827
00:58:52,829 --> 00:58:54,421
You guys in?

828
00:58:54,497 --> 00:58:57,625
- Is it pure?
- Yeah, just like last time.

829
00:58:59,168 --> 00:59:01,534
- When is it coming?
- It'll be here soon.

830
00:59:01,604 --> 00:59:04,437
As soon as it gets here,
I'll send it down.

831
00:59:04,507 --> 00:59:07,067
- All right.
- All right.

832
00:59:10,446 --> 00:59:13,040
Hey... you going to ask me
about my visit?

833
00:59:13,116 --> 00:59:16,711
- Fuck your visit. Got the shit?
- Yeah, man.

834
00:59:16,786 --> 00:59:20,381
You know how it is. My old lady
come through like gangbusters.

835
00:59:20,456 --> 00:59:23,789
- The shit, bro.'
- Okay, man. Hold your horses.

836
00:59:23,860 --> 00:59:26,454
I have to get it out first.

837
00:59:37,974 --> 00:59:41,375
Ooh, that feels good.

838
00:59:41,444 --> 00:59:43,912
You're a sick fuck, man.

839
01:01:19,008 --> 01:01:22,444
K.C. Pulled a major
dope fiend move...

840
01:01:22,512 --> 01:01:26,209
put the hit
on the Brotherhood shit.

841
01:01:27,850 --> 01:01:31,377
I never seen a fool
make a bigger mistake.

842
01:01:41,364 --> 01:01:43,628
Eddie: Dang, man,
did you eat some of that

843
01:01:43,700 --> 01:01:45,634
nasty "chuck and cluck"
for dinner?

844
01:01:45,702 --> 01:01:47,465
(choking)

845
01:01:47,537 --> 01:01:49,300
Frank: You are one
lying motherfucker.

846
01:01:49,372 --> 01:01:51,465
Kenny: That is one of them
"stealth" motherfuckers...

847
01:01:51,541 --> 01:01:53,975
silent but deadly.
It just creeps up on you.

848
01:01:54,043 --> 01:01:57,342
Eddie:
Goddamn it, Frankie. Damn.

849
01:01:57,413 --> 01:02:00,314
Fuck the both of you.
What the fuck is this?

850
01:02:00,383 --> 01:02:02,647
Are you guys playing
or what?

851
01:02:02,719 --> 01:02:04,277
I ain't calling you
a liar, Frank,

852
01:02:04,353 --> 01:02:06,344
but that was
a garlic-smelling one.

853
01:02:06,422 --> 01:02:10,256
You're the only garlic-eating
motherfucker around here.

854
01:02:10,326 --> 01:02:12,886
Kiss my garlic ass,
Hillbilly.

855
01:02:12,962 --> 01:02:15,328
You are one stanky
motherfucker.

856
01:02:15,398 --> 01:02:18,925
"Stanky-Frankie."

857
01:02:19,001 --> 01:02:21,435
What the fuck is this?
Are you guys in or out?

858
01:02:21,504 --> 01:02:25,133
OI' wop-ass Frank
must have a good hand.

859
01:02:25,208 --> 01:02:27,267
Who the fuck is this guy?

860
01:02:27,343 --> 01:02:30,107
Who the fuck you calling
a goddamn wop, you little shit?

861
01:02:30,179 --> 01:02:32,579
Come on, "dago-boy,"
you're the only

862
01:02:32,648 --> 01:02:35,082
Mussolini-looking
motherfucker around here.

863
01:02:35,151 --> 01:02:37,176
(laughter)

864
01:02:37,253 --> 01:02:39,949
Mussolini
was bald, man.

865
01:02:40,022 --> 01:02:43,617
No, no, I think Mussolini
was a breakfast cereal.

866
01:02:43,693 --> 01:02:45,786
No, man, Mussolini
was a wop.

867
01:02:45,862 --> 01:02:47,796
Wasn't he
a big fat, greasy...

868
01:02:47,864 --> 01:02:49,798
Motherfucker,
give a little respect...!

869
01:02:49,866 --> 01:02:51,333
- You understand?
- Frank!

870
01:02:51,400 --> 01:02:56,269
He's just a stupid, goddamn
hillbilly. It ain't worth it.

871
01:02:56,339 --> 01:02:59,172
(coughing)

872
01:03:01,043 --> 01:03:04,911
Goddamn it, Hillbilly,
you're one dumbass motherfucker.

873
01:03:04,981 --> 01:03:07,245
What are you trying
to do, kill me?

874
01:03:07,316 --> 01:03:09,580
If I was trying to kill
your ass, you'd be dead.

875
01:03:09,652 --> 01:03:11,745
Are you guys finished?

876
01:03:11,821 --> 01:03:16,087
- Yeah, we're finished.
- All right. Let's play.

877
01:03:21,898 --> 01:03:24,628
(rapid clicking)

878
01:03:27,270 --> 01:03:30,239
- Fuck, Hillbilly!
- Damn it, man, stop crying.

879
01:03:30,306 --> 01:03:32,866
- You sound like my bitch.
- Who you calling "bitch"?

880
01:03:32,942 --> 01:03:36,309
Just hold still.
Hold still.

881
01:03:40,016 --> 01:03:41,950
So, K.C.,

882
01:03:42,018 --> 01:03:44,316
you're coming in
on a violation, huh?

883
01:03:44,387 --> 01:03:46,947
I'm always back in
on a violation.

884
01:03:48,024 --> 01:03:52,051
I'm starting to look at
my release dates like furloughs.

885
01:03:53,196 --> 01:03:55,130
Ever since I was 14 years old,

886
01:03:55,198 --> 01:04:00,659
the longest I've ever been out
is 18... 18 months.

887
01:04:00,736 --> 01:04:02,670
So what did you do
on your last "furlough"?

888
01:04:02,738 --> 01:04:06,469
I broke the record, man.
16 hours.

889
01:04:08,177 --> 01:04:10,168
Damn, what happened?

890
01:04:10,246 --> 01:04:13,909
I went over to my old lady's house
to see my kid...

891
01:04:13,983 --> 01:04:18,579
she's been hanging out with this
fucking "new age" wuss motherfucker.

892
01:04:18,654 --> 01:04:21,953
I pull up and he comes out
on the porch

893
01:04:22,024 --> 01:04:24,492
and he says I can't
come into my house...

894
01:04:24,560 --> 01:04:27,393
like he's gonna stand
in the way of my kid.

895
01:04:27,463 --> 01:04:30,261
Yeah?
What did you do, homes?

896
01:04:30,333 --> 01:04:32,096
What the fuck you think
I did, man?

897
01:04:32,168 --> 01:04:34,102
I broke his jaw
in three places.

898
01:04:34,170 --> 01:04:36,161
(laughter)

899
01:04:36,239 --> 01:04:38,571
So did you get a chance
to see your kid?

900
01:04:38,641 --> 01:04:42,600
No, man. The bitch
called "the man" on me.

901
01:04:42,678 --> 01:04:45,943
They were down on me
like white on rice.

902
01:04:46,015 --> 01:04:48,609
I was back in the joint
since that night.

903
01:04:48,684 --> 01:04:50,311
Goddamn it, man.

904
01:04:50,386 --> 01:04:53,787
You mean to tell me you didn't get
any pussy while you were out there?

905
01:04:53,856 --> 01:04:55,949
Shit...

906
01:04:56,025 --> 01:04:59,290
it wasn't
in the cards, man.

907
01:04:59,362 --> 01:05:03,389
Besides, who needs pussy
when I got punks like you in here?

908
01:05:03,466 --> 01:05:06,560
I got your "punk" right here.

909
01:05:06,636 --> 01:05:09,730
You didn't even get any dope
while you were out there.

910
01:05:09,805 --> 01:05:12,069
That's the sad part
about it.

911
01:05:12,141 --> 01:05:14,268
Me, I'd be
out the gate at 8:00,

912
01:05:14,343 --> 01:05:16,402
and in the spoon by noon.

913
01:05:16,479 --> 01:05:18,913
Yeah, "Shakespeare," you'd also
be in the pen by 10:00.

914
01:05:18,981 --> 01:05:20,915
- (needle stops)
- Fuck, man!

915
01:05:20,983 --> 01:05:24,942
Sorry, man.
It's getting jammed up on me.

916
01:05:26,088 --> 01:05:28,056
Slim: Well, it looks like
you're "in the car" now.

917
01:05:28,124 --> 01:05:30,183
What are you
talking about, dude?

918
01:05:30,259 --> 01:05:32,853
Word has it
that you're holding.

919
01:05:32,929 --> 01:05:35,864
Who tells you this shit?

920
01:05:35,932 --> 01:05:38,833
Anybody that would tell you
shit like that is a liar, man.

921
01:05:38,901 --> 01:05:41,495
Ain't got shit.

922
01:05:42,672 --> 01:05:44,765
- (needle stops)
- Ow! Damn it, Hillbilly!

923
01:05:44,840 --> 01:05:47,604
Damn, I'm sorry, man.
We're gonna have to stop.

924
01:05:47,677 --> 01:05:49,611
This thing is getting
jammed up on me.

925
01:05:49,679 --> 01:05:51,203
All right,
let's put it away.

926
01:05:52,281 --> 01:05:55,580
- How's your lady doing?
- She's doing cool.

927
01:05:55,651 --> 01:05:57,118
Get your pictures
of your daughter?

928
01:05:57,186 --> 01:05:59,245
- Yep. Sent them.
- Oh, yeah?

929
01:05:59,322 --> 01:06:01,222
Them at the new pad
and shit.

930
01:06:01,290 --> 01:06:03,986
That's cool, man. I'm expecting
some pictures, too.

931
01:06:04,060 --> 01:06:07,052
Oh, yeah?

932
01:06:07,129 --> 01:06:09,393
Got something for you.

933
01:06:09,465 --> 01:06:12,093
- Thanks, man.
- All right.

934
01:06:14,303 --> 01:06:17,739
(speaking Spanish)

935
01:06:17,807 --> 01:06:20,640
- Shoot this out to everybody, man.
- V ato: Hell, yeah.

936
01:06:20,710 --> 01:06:23,907
- Gonna handle some business.
- That's right, make some money.

937
01:06:23,980 --> 01:06:25,572
It better be good.

938
01:06:25,648 --> 01:06:27,479
I'll check it out right now.

939
01:06:29,986 --> 01:06:32,250
Okay, Jamerson, get up.

940
01:06:32,321 --> 01:06:34,755
What's up, Dudley?
Why you want to shake me down?

941
01:06:34,824 --> 01:06:36,917
We got the word on you.

942
01:06:36,993 --> 01:06:39,587
Just get up and shut up.

943
01:06:47,336 --> 01:06:49,702
(muttering)
I can't believe this.

944
01:06:53,009 --> 01:06:56,775
Well... look
what we have here.

945
01:06:58,347 --> 01:07:00,542
You know the routine.

946
01:07:04,720 --> 01:07:07,746
That's my partner.
How many points we got?

947
01:07:07,823 --> 01:07:11,224
Let's just put it this way...
we are kicking ass.

948
01:07:11,293 --> 01:07:16,060
Frank: That's a temporary setback.
Just play your cards.

949
01:07:16,132 --> 01:07:18,157
Goddamn it, Frankie,
what's up?

950
01:07:18,234 --> 01:07:20,600
You're supposed to be
the big fucking master and all.

951
01:07:20,669 --> 01:07:22,728
I'm already in the hole
for two cartons.

952
01:07:22,805 --> 01:07:25,069
Jesus Christ
on a motherfucking ladder.

953
01:07:25,141 --> 01:07:27,575
All you can do is play
the hand you're dealt.

954
01:07:27,643 --> 01:07:29,838
That's right.

955
01:07:34,984 --> 01:07:37,248
Where is he?
Where is Eddie?

956
01:07:37,319 --> 01:07:41,085
Is he scared to come by
since we beat him last time?

957
01:07:41,157 --> 01:07:44,786
No, he's on the phone sweating
that dope, trying to get a visit.

958
01:07:44,860 --> 01:07:46,122
(laughter)

959
01:07:46,195 --> 01:07:48,095
No one's gonna visit
that punk.

960
01:07:48,164 --> 01:07:50,257
Shit, you know
when he left the street

961
01:07:50,332 --> 01:07:52,766
them bitches
were having a party.

962
01:07:53,836 --> 01:07:56,270
He's says he's the man.

963
01:07:56,338 --> 01:08:01,401
"The King of New Orleans."
"The Great Cajun Pimp."

964
01:08:04,947 --> 01:08:07,882
Frank: Word's out that somebody
did snitch on Todd

965
01:08:07,950 --> 01:08:09,884
in that "unfortunate incident."

966
01:08:09,952 --> 01:08:13,046
Everybody knew
the motherfucker was holding.

967
01:08:13,122 --> 01:08:14,885
All these petty-ass
punks up in here,

968
01:08:14,957 --> 01:08:16,891
I'm surprised
it didn't happen sooner.

969
01:08:16,959 --> 01:08:19,723
I understand the dope
belonged to the Brotherhood.

970
01:08:19,795 --> 01:08:23,026
That means somebody's
gonna get fucked up.

971
01:08:24,700 --> 01:08:27,225
Yo te mato, yo te mato

972
01:08:27,303 --> 01:08:30,295
Yo te mato traficando

973
01:08:30,372 --> 01:08:32,966
Yo te mato, yo te mato

974
01:08:33,042 --> 01:08:35,840
Yo te mato traficando

975
01:08:35,911 --> 01:08:38,471
Yo te mato, yo te mato

976
01:08:38,547 --> 01:08:41,209
Yo te mato traficando

977
01:08:41,283 --> 01:08:44,184
Yo te mato, yo te mato

978
01:08:44,253 --> 01:08:46,744
Yo te mato traficando...

979
01:08:47,823 --> 01:08:49,586
- What's up, man?
- What's up?

980
01:08:49,658 --> 01:08:51,421
You think
I'm some kind of clown?

981
01:08:51,494 --> 01:08:52,927
What are you talking about?

982
01:08:52,995 --> 01:08:54,929
That dope was bad, homes.

983
01:08:54,997 --> 01:08:58,763
If it was bad, I'll take care of it.
Don't come off crazy.

984
01:08:58,834 --> 01:09:00,699
I come as crazy
as I want, homeboy.

985
01:09:00,769 --> 01:09:04,205
You want me to take care of it
or you wanna have a problem?

986
01:09:04,273 --> 01:09:05,865
- Take care of it.
- All right.

987
01:09:05,941 --> 01:09:08,705
You know my word is good.
I'm not going to fuck you over.

988
01:09:08,777 --> 01:09:11,371
If it's bunk, we'll handle it.

989
01:09:11,447 --> 01:09:13,847
If the dude who bought it is bunk,
I'll handle him too.

990
01:09:13,916 --> 01:09:16,851
- Don't worry about it.
- You better handle him.

991
01:09:19,822 --> 01:09:22,188
(inmates' voices yelling)

992
01:09:48,651 --> 01:09:51,415
It's like you guys thought...
it ain't no good.

993
01:09:51,487 --> 01:09:53,921
- It's bunk.
- Let's go handle it.

994
01:09:55,391 --> 01:09:59,760
Hey, man, we got to do something if
these fools don't put in that work.

995
01:09:59,828 --> 01:10:01,591
I know he said
he was going to do it,

996
01:10:01,664 --> 01:10:04,929
but he better do something,
'cause this shit ain't right.

997
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:06,160
- That shit was bunk.
- I know.

998
01:10:06,235 --> 01:10:08,260
Can't let them disrespect us.

999
01:10:08,337 --> 01:10:11,773
But like he said, he said
he was going to check that fool.

1000
01:10:11,840 --> 01:10:14,934
If he don't, we're going
to find out who it was.

1001
01:10:15,010 --> 01:10:18,605
- V ato #1: Check that fool.
- Handle business, bro'.

1002
01:10:18,681 --> 01:10:21,275
Carnales are disappointed
about what's happening.

1003
01:10:21,350 --> 01:10:23,113
I know, man,
but check it out.

1004
01:10:23,185 --> 01:10:26,120
Got a little bit longer.
I'm short-timing anyway.

1005
01:10:26,188 --> 01:10:28,122
Sammytown ain't going
to be about nada.

1006
01:10:28,190 --> 01:10:30,283
Tú sabes, I get out
in a few months,

1007
01:10:30,359 --> 01:10:33,192
my tio's out of Federal,
be back in Michoacan.

1008
01:10:33,262 --> 01:10:35,423
That's all I got to say...
Michoacan.

1009
01:10:35,497 --> 01:10:38,159
- You know it's pure.
- Open up the whole clientele.

1010
01:10:38,234 --> 01:10:40,099
Hell, yeah.

1011
01:10:40,169 --> 01:10:42,262
Let's do this clown.

1012
01:10:46,208 --> 01:10:48,108
(rock music playing)

1013
01:11:45,868 --> 01:11:48,302
Check it out, Slim.
Word's out on K.C.

1014
01:11:48,370 --> 01:11:51,737
He's going down.
Stay away from that guy.

1015
01:11:51,807 --> 01:11:55,538
That guy's no fucking good.
Don't even go sit next to him.

1016
01:11:55,611 --> 01:11:57,636
It'll be nice and short.
You watch your back.

1017
01:11:57,713 --> 01:12:00,238
- All right?
- I appreciate it.

1018
01:12:04,486 --> 01:12:06,647
What's up with that
piece of shit, K.C.?

1019
01:12:06,722 --> 01:12:09,384
Fuck if I know.

1020
01:12:09,458 --> 01:12:11,426
Ain't you and him
road dogs?

1021
01:12:11,493 --> 01:12:13,859
He ain't my road dog.

1022
01:12:13,929 --> 01:12:15,487
That punk is going down.

1023
01:12:15,564 --> 01:12:20,467
If we find out you're "in the car,"
you're going down with him.

1024
01:12:27,176 --> 01:12:30,111
What did that dude want?

1025
01:12:30,179 --> 01:12:33,444
I don't know, but he was
tripping on some shit.

1026
01:12:33,515 --> 01:12:35,107
Oh, yeah, yeah.

1027
01:12:35,184 --> 01:12:38,278
I heard some weird shit went down
with that dope that Todd had.

1028
01:12:38,354 --> 01:12:40,788
- Like what?
- I don't know.

1029
01:12:40,856 --> 01:12:43,381
But something ain't right.

1030
01:12:44,960 --> 01:12:47,451
You in the car yet?

1031
01:12:47,529 --> 01:12:50,225
I'm in for my visit, yeah.

1032
01:12:50,299 --> 01:12:54,258
I thought you were supposed
to get a visit last week.

1033
01:12:54,336 --> 01:12:55,894
Or was it the week
before that?

1034
01:12:55,971 --> 01:12:58,303
You're laughing at me now,

1035
01:12:58,374 --> 01:13:01,207
but when I get mine, you're all
gonna be coming to me.

1036
01:13:01,276 --> 01:13:02,903
Huh?

1037
01:13:02,978 --> 01:13:05,412
I'm going to be
sitting fat just like K.C.

1038
01:13:05,481 --> 01:13:07,244
You think he's got the shit?

1039
01:13:07,316 --> 01:13:11,047
I know it. He thinks nobody knows,
but he ain't fooling me.

1040
01:13:11,120 --> 01:13:14,021
I know he's got that shit.

1041
01:13:16,158 --> 01:13:18,922
Yeah, but that dope belongs
to the Brotherhood.

1042
01:13:18,994 --> 01:13:20,928
You don't think
he'd be crazy enough

1043
01:13:20,996 --> 01:13:22,759
to fuck with their shit,
do you?

1044
01:13:22,831 --> 01:13:24,765
I don't know.

1045
01:13:24,833 --> 01:13:26,767
But he's got somebody's dope.

1046
01:13:26,835 --> 01:13:29,201
And he ain't
kicking down to nobody.

1047
01:13:30,672 --> 01:13:32,936
That's all right,

1048
01:13:33,008 --> 01:13:36,000
'cause I'm going to be
hooked up in a minute.

1049
01:13:37,413 --> 01:13:40,280
Yeah, I ain't holding
my breath.

1050
01:13:41,350 --> 01:13:43,875
Well, you keep on
breathing, then.

1051
01:13:51,026 --> 01:13:53,551
What are we going
to do about K.C.?

1052
01:13:54,696 --> 01:13:57,028
I don't know. If we let K.C.
Get away with it,

1053
01:13:57,099 --> 01:13:59,624
every "lop" will want
to get over.

1054
01:13:59,701 --> 01:14:02,727
We got those youngsters
that rolled in from State.

1055
01:14:02,805 --> 01:14:04,534
Let them earn their bones.

1056
01:14:04,606 --> 01:14:06,733
Sounds good to me, dawg.

1057
01:14:06,809 --> 01:14:08,902
(voices talking loudly)

1058
01:14:19,688 --> 01:14:22,088
(inmates cheering)

1059
01:14:25,327 --> 01:14:28,091
Slim: Everybody could feel
the tension in the place.

1060
01:14:28,163 --> 01:14:31,257
It was going down
and nobody was gonna stop it.

1061
01:14:50,018 --> 01:14:52,782
Hating breeds your disease

1062
01:14:52,855 --> 01:14:55,449
Gave me a number

1063
01:14:55,524 --> 01:14:59,620
And took away my name

1064
01:14:59,695 --> 01:15:03,722
Dying, dying

1065
01:15:03,799 --> 01:15:06,359
In the city of pain

1066
01:15:06,435 --> 01:15:09,871
The emptiness...
tortured nights

1067
01:15:09,938 --> 01:15:12,907
Sands of stone...
got no rights

1068
01:15:12,975 --> 01:15:14,533
Sharpened knives

1069
01:15:14,610 --> 01:15:16,805
Pools of blood

1070
01:15:16,879 --> 01:15:20,679
No way out,
forgotten son

1071
01:15:20,749 --> 01:15:24,082
Gave me a number

1072
01:15:24,152 --> 01:15:27,178
And took away my name

1073
01:15:27,256 --> 01:15:30,248
Dying, dying...

1074
01:15:31,326 --> 01:15:33,419
(yells)

1075
01:15:33,495 --> 01:15:35,929
(moaning)

1076
01:15:43,105 --> 01:15:45,039
(scraping)

1077
01:15:48,844 --> 01:15:51,108
Slim: Sammytown went off.

1078
01:15:51,179 --> 01:15:53,443
Once the killing started,

1079
01:15:53,515 --> 01:15:55,779
he wasn't stopping at K.C.

1080
01:15:55,851 --> 01:15:58,376
He was going for old scores.

1081
01:16:51,173 --> 01:16:54,700
We were all locked down
for about a week after that.

1082
01:16:56,178 --> 01:16:59,375
It gave me time to think
about what had happened.

1083
01:17:01,350 --> 01:17:04,911
It all came crashing down
on me like a ton of bricks...

1084
01:17:05,988 --> 01:17:10,652
the realization that I'd been
chasing the bag my entire life.

1085
01:17:13,128 --> 01:17:18,293
And all it ever brought me
and everyone around me was pain.

1086
01:17:21,303 --> 01:17:25,000
That's when I started
thinking I was done.

1087
01:17:28,644 --> 01:17:30,578
Frank: The cards
are beautiful tonight.

1088
01:17:30,646 --> 01:17:34,104
Yeah, yeah. You're having
your streak, I'll give you that.

1089
01:17:34,182 --> 01:17:36,582
But the cards are bound
to come my way.

1090
01:17:36,652 --> 01:17:38,745
Looky here.

1091
01:17:39,821 --> 01:17:42,585
Man, that's fucked up,
what happened to K.C.

1092
01:17:42,658 --> 01:17:45,092
That motherfucker shouldn't
have gotten greedy.

1093
01:17:45,160 --> 01:17:46,923
What do you mean?

1094
01:17:46,995 --> 01:17:49,589
I don't know what went down
between him and Todd,

1095
01:17:49,665 --> 01:17:51,929
but word is that Todd
is coming out of the hole

1096
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:53,934
on the account of that dope
came up negative.

1097
01:17:54,002 --> 01:17:57,096
The brothers around here
are saying K.C. Was living large.

1098
01:17:57,172 --> 01:18:00,767
He might have put the hit
before Todd got out of the hole.

1099
01:18:00,842 --> 01:18:03,072
Slim:
Shit, for all we know

1100
01:18:03,145 --> 01:18:06,046
K.C. Was probably the one who
snitched him off in the first place.

1101
01:18:06,114 --> 01:18:07,081
Might have been.

1102
01:18:07,149 --> 01:18:10,880
I knew that guy was stupid.
I didn't believe he was that stupid.

1103
01:18:10,952 --> 01:18:13,887
I don't give a fuck about that
Nazi-ass bastard. He's dead now.

1104
01:18:13,955 --> 01:18:18,392
All I give a shit about is that
he owed me two cartons for a tattoo.

1105
01:18:18,460 --> 01:18:20,394
Frank:
Get paid up front next time.

1106
01:18:20,462 --> 01:18:23,056
You got that right.

1107
01:18:23,131 --> 01:18:26,225
Well, if it ain't
the big Cajun pimp.

1108
01:18:26,301 --> 01:18:28,394
How's your "quest
to slumberland" going?

1109
01:18:28,470 --> 01:18:30,404
I'm gonna get
a visit tomorrow.

1110
01:18:30,472 --> 01:18:31,905
(loud laughter)

1111
01:18:31,973 --> 01:18:33,907
Eddie, when are you
going to give it up?

1112
01:18:33,975 --> 01:18:36,068
Nobody gives a shit
about your coon-ass.

1113
01:18:36,144 --> 01:18:38,374
You'll see.

1114
01:18:38,447 --> 01:18:40,244
(mocking laughter)

1115
01:18:45,153 --> 01:18:47,087
I have to go now, huh?

1116
01:18:47,155 --> 01:18:49,419
I'm telling you,
when I make my big score,

1117
01:18:49,491 --> 01:18:51,584
you'll all be trying
to get in the car.

1118
01:18:51,660 --> 01:18:54,754
- You'll see.
- All right, Eddie.

1119
01:18:54,830 --> 01:18:58,027
- Good luck, Eddie.
- Eddie, we believe.

1120
01:19:00,902 --> 01:19:03,063
Fucking Eddie.

1121
01:19:06,742 --> 01:19:09,336
- Eddie: What's up?
- Not much, man.

1122
01:19:09,411 --> 01:19:11,538
Just working the clock.

1123
01:19:11,613 --> 01:19:13,274
Check it out, Slim.

1124
01:19:17,452 --> 01:19:19,545
It's the Rolls Royce.

1125
01:19:19,621 --> 01:19:21,384
It's the Cadillac.

1126
01:19:21,456 --> 01:19:23,981
It's the fucking motherlode.

1127
01:19:24,059 --> 01:19:26,960
Damn, Eddie.

1128
01:19:28,029 --> 01:19:29,792
You finally came through,
didn't you?

1129
01:19:29,865 --> 01:19:32,231
That's right.
You thought I wouldn't?

1130
01:19:32,300 --> 01:19:35,235
I'm going to be
living large now.

1131
01:19:35,303 --> 01:19:38,397
Fuck.
That is the shit.

1132
01:19:38,473 --> 01:19:42,068
Come on, man, let's do some.
Let's do some.

1133
01:19:42,144 --> 01:19:45,011
(sighs)

1134
01:19:47,149 --> 01:19:48,912
That's all right.

1135
01:19:48,984 --> 01:19:51,919
What are you fucking
talking about?

1136
01:19:51,987 --> 01:19:53,614
I mean, I don't want
to do any.

1137
01:19:53,688 --> 01:19:56,418
I've been trying to come up
with that for three months.

1138
01:19:56,491 --> 01:19:58,755
Now you're telling me
you don't want none?

1139
01:19:58,827 --> 01:20:01,022
Are you fucking crazy?

1140
01:20:02,164 --> 01:20:04,098
I'm done with that shit, man.

1141
01:20:04,166 --> 01:20:07,465
Are you getting
a little soft in the head?

1142
01:20:07,536 --> 01:20:10,266
I see how it is.

1143
01:20:10,338 --> 01:20:12,863
I see how it is, yeah.

1144
01:20:14,176 --> 01:20:16,303
Fuck it, then.

1145
01:20:17,846 --> 01:20:20,906
Hey, Hillbilly, wait up.
I got something for you.

1146
01:20:24,753 --> 01:20:28,120
That poor ol' Eddie.
He must have had buzzard's luck.

1147
01:20:28,190 --> 01:20:32,593
'Cause after he and Hillbilly
fired up the smack...

1148
01:20:32,661 --> 01:20:35,357
the next morning,
they call him down

1149
01:20:35,430 --> 01:20:38,797
to the lieutenant's office
for a random piss test.

1150
01:20:38,867 --> 01:20:42,496
He stayed in the hole
for the rest of my time.

1151
01:20:45,373 --> 01:20:47,307
You getting short,
huh, Slim?

1152
01:20:47,375 --> 01:20:48,967
Oh, yeah.

1153
01:20:49,044 --> 01:20:52,980
Listen, Slim... you hit the street
and keep on running,

1154
01:20:53,048 --> 01:20:57,144
and don't look back because
this place ain't no good for you.

1155
01:20:57,219 --> 01:21:00,655
Yeah, Pops, I know.

1156
01:21:00,722 --> 01:21:04,180
I'm done with this
tired fucking place.

1157
01:21:05,660 --> 01:21:07,753
There's got to be
more happening in life

1158
01:21:07,829 --> 01:21:10,320
than coming back
to this shithole.

1159
01:21:16,338 --> 01:21:19,171
Okay, Williams,
roll it up.

1160
01:21:19,241 --> 01:21:22,267
- Huh?
- You're going home.

1161
01:21:31,853 --> 01:21:34,219
Yes!

1162
01:22:55,303 --> 01:22:57,635
Once I hit the outside world,

1163
01:22:57,706 --> 01:23:01,642
all I wanted to do is get as far
from my old haunts as possible.

1164
01:23:01,710 --> 01:23:03,405
(knocking)

1165
01:23:03,478 --> 01:23:06,345
But old ghosts
are hard to shake.

1166
01:23:15,323 --> 01:23:18,087
- Hey.
- What do you want?

1167
01:23:19,160 --> 01:23:21,993
I just came by to see you.

1168
01:23:22,063 --> 01:23:24,759
So what?

1169
01:23:24,833 --> 01:23:26,767
I missed you, Slim.

1170
01:23:26,835 --> 01:23:29,702
I've been thinking
about you.

1171
01:23:31,006 --> 01:23:33,531
Can I come in?

1172
01:23:40,015 --> 01:23:42,643
So, what have you been up to?

1173
01:23:45,854 --> 01:23:48,288
Just denting the couch.

1174
01:23:51,026 --> 01:23:53,392
Can I have a cigarette?

1175
01:23:59,868 --> 01:24:01,836
Thanks.

1176
01:24:17,485 --> 01:24:19,510
(chuckling)

1177
01:24:21,156 --> 01:24:24,125
For a minute there,
I thought you were sincere.

1178
01:24:25,493 --> 01:24:28,087
- Slim, it's...
- You just came to see me, right?

1179
01:24:28,163 --> 01:24:30,757
Come on in, Paulie.

1180
01:24:30,832 --> 01:24:32,993
Long time no see.

1181
01:24:33,068 --> 01:24:35,559
Yeah, it has been a while.

1182
01:24:37,005 --> 01:24:39,200
Mm-hmm.
Yeah, it has.

1183
01:24:41,176 --> 01:24:44,111
(chuckling)

1184
01:24:44,179 --> 01:24:48,115
I guess this is
where you take me out.

1185
01:24:48,183 --> 01:24:50,310
It doesn't have
to be like that, man.

1186
01:24:50,385 --> 01:24:54,116
Just give me the money.

1187
01:24:54,189 --> 01:24:56,714
Fuck you!

1188
01:24:57,859 --> 01:25:00,794
- Just give him...
- And fuck you, too!

1189
01:25:05,133 --> 01:25:10,196
Slim, just give me
the money, all right?

1190
01:25:10,271 --> 01:25:12,569
Paulie, you got no balls.

1191
01:25:12,640 --> 01:25:16,838
Put your toy away before
you hurt yourself, all right?

1192
01:25:20,982 --> 01:25:23,075
You think I'm fucking stupid?

1193
01:25:23,151 --> 01:25:26,177
Me, stupid, you smart, huh?

1194
01:25:26,254 --> 01:25:28,154
- Just give him the money.
- You're gonna let this go on?

1195
01:25:28,223 --> 01:25:30,282
- Just give him the money.
- Give me the money.

1196
01:25:30,358 --> 01:25:31,882
Fuck both of you!

1197
01:25:31,960 --> 01:25:34,428
You think I'm not
going to shoot you?

1198
01:25:34,496 --> 01:25:37,090
- All right?
- Just give him the money.

1199
01:25:37,165 --> 01:25:39,429
I'm not going
to shoot you, right?

1200
01:25:40,502 --> 01:25:42,595
What the fuck
are you doing, Paulie?

1201
01:25:42,670 --> 01:25:44,865
(laughing)
Who's fucking smart now?

1202
01:25:44,939 --> 01:25:47,032
Huh? Look at that!

1203
01:25:47,108 --> 01:25:49,008
Look at that!

1204
01:25:49,077 --> 01:25:52,308
- Who's fucking smart now?
- Paulie!

1205
01:25:52,380 --> 01:25:55,406
Who's fucking smart now?

1206
01:25:55,483 --> 01:25:58,941
Paulie, stop it!
You stop this right now!

1207
01:25:59,020 --> 01:26:02,421
Bit by fucking bit,
I'll take you out...

1208
01:26:02,490 --> 01:26:04,822
Just like that...!

1209
01:26:09,797 --> 01:26:12,027
(gun clicks)

1210
01:26:16,638 --> 01:26:18,970
Here's your fucking end.

1211
01:26:25,980 --> 01:26:29,416
Everything wasn't
exactly going to plan.

1212
01:26:29,484 --> 01:26:31,748
I had two bodies
in my living room,

1213
01:26:31,819 --> 01:26:34,617
a bullet in my shoulder,
and I was on the run.

1214
01:26:34,689 --> 01:26:37,681
(train horn blasts)

1215
01:26:40,828 --> 01:26:43,319
It was looking like
my luck was running out.

1216
01:26:43,398 --> 01:26:46,299
It was nine hours
to the border.

1217
01:26:46,367 --> 01:26:49,564
All I knew was,
I'm not going down again.

1218
01:26:49,637 --> 01:26:51,798
I'd rather bleed to death.

1219
01:26:51,873 --> 01:26:54,808
(crossing bells ringing)

1220
01:27:03,284 --> 01:27:06,253
(loud horn blasts)

1221
01:27:13,127 --> 01:27:15,561
I was driving all night...

1222
01:27:15,630 --> 01:27:19,066
bleeding bad.

1223
01:27:19,133 --> 01:27:22,967
I finally crossed the border,
looking for the nearest hotel.

1224
01:27:25,139 --> 01:27:27,198
I probably wouldn't
have noticed this place

1225
01:27:27,275 --> 01:27:29,072
if you hadn't caught my eye.

1226
01:27:29,143 --> 01:27:31,373
All that I've been through...

1227
01:27:31,446 --> 01:27:33,880
it's nice just to talk
to someone...

1228
01:27:33,948 --> 01:27:35,916
(bills rustling)

1229
01:27:37,652 --> 01:27:40,917
Even though I have to pay you
just to sit here,

1230
01:27:40,989 --> 01:27:44,390
and you probably don't understand
a word I'm saying.

1231
01:27:53,001 --> 01:27:55,128
(door closes)

1232
01:28:06,614 --> 01:28:09,208
Someday I'll be on
the radio

1233
01:28:09,284 --> 01:28:11,912
A Latin music star

1234
01:28:11,986 --> 01:28:15,319
Maybe I'll be like

1235
01:28:15,390 --> 01:28:18,484
Jose Feliciano

1236
01:28:18,559 --> 01:28:21,426
Everyone
will sing my song

1237
01:28:21,496 --> 01:28:24,659
Everyone
won't stop dancing

1238
01:28:24,732 --> 01:28:27,462
Maybe I'll change
my name...

1239
01:28:27,535 --> 01:28:30,527
Quizá cambiaré
mi nombre

1240
01:28:30,605 --> 01:28:35,736
El pasado
es el pasado

1241
01:28:35,810 --> 01:28:38,574
Eso no es
importante...

1242
01:28:38,646 --> 01:28:41,638
But the future
looks very good

1243
01:28:41,716 --> 01:28:44,344
Llama a mi jefe

1244
01:28:44,419 --> 01:28:47,411
I won't be in today

1245
01:28:47,488 --> 01:28:50,355
Got too much to do

1246
01:28:50,425 --> 01:28:52,825
I've got too much to do

1247
01:28:52,894 --> 01:28:56,022
Someday I'll be on Tv

1248
01:28:56,097 --> 01:28:58,565
En Telemundo

1249
01:28:58,633 --> 01:29:01,500
I'll have a show like

1250
01:29:01,569 --> 01:29:04,538
Don Francisco

1251
01:29:04,605 --> 01:29:07,574
Everyone
will like me

1252
01:29:07,642 --> 01:29:10,611
Niños will
look up to me

1253
01:29:10,678 --> 01:29:13,704
Maybe I'll change
my name

1254
01:29:13,781 --> 01:29:16,773
Quizá cambiaré
mi nombre

1255
01:29:16,851 --> 01:29:21,982
El pasado
es el pasado

1256
01:29:22,056 --> 01:29:24,820
Eso no es
importante...

1257
01:29:24,892 --> 01:29:29,056
But the future
looks very good

1258
01:29:29,130 --> 01:29:31,963
Llama a mi jefe

1259
01:29:32,033 --> 01:29:34,160
I won't be in today

1260
01:29:34,235 --> 01:29:36,567
I've got too much to do

1261
01:29:36,637 --> 01:29:40,095
I've got too much to do.

1262
01:29:40,174 --> 01:29:42,699
(music break)

1263
01:29:50,118 --> 01:29:52,484
(music continues)
