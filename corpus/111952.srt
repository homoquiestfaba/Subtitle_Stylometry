00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:00,589
Yes, sir.

Motion.

Stable.

10
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:26,918
Status check, please.

11
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:32,516

<i>Excellent.</i>

Carry on, gentlemen.

14
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:54,918
-Come on. Come on!
-What're you doing, man?

15
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:02,596
All right. All right, we're here.

16
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:05,520
What restaurant is this?
Where the front door at?

17
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:08,075
We go in the back.
lt's like VlP, you know?

18
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:10,874
Only cool people go in the back,
like Madonna. . .

19
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,997
. . .and Dennis Rodman
and Gary Coleman.

20
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:16,351
lt's real controversial stars
coming in this place.

21
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:17,675
All right.

22
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:19,669
l'm not doing it.

23
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:21,472
All we gotta do is knock this off.

24
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:25,070
We'll get a couple of grand.
l been casing this joint for months.

25
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:26,110
Look.

26
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:28,271
You been casing it
and got one picture?

27
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:30,471
Film is expensive. Look at that.

28
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:34,958
Shrimp? You on parole and you here
trying to go back for stealing shrimp?

29
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:37,839
Not shrimps, baby. Prawns.

30
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:39,473
What the fuck is a prawn?

31
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:43,639
A prawn is bigger than shrimp. You
ever order a jumbo shrimp cocktail?

32
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:46,308
And they real big
like they been working out?

33
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:48,272
Like they on steroids?
That's prawns.

34
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:51,199
Eating one prawn,
that's like five or six shrimp.

35
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:53,595
Yeah, right.
l'm going back to the truck.

36
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:56,519
Fredo did the same thing to Michael
in <i>The Godfather.</i>

37
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,631
''Fredo, don't ever go
against the family.

38
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:01,559
Don't disrespect me and my father.
Get the fuck out here! ''

39
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:16,432
You're deviating.

40
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:19,595
Give me a second.

41
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:24,191
We don't have a second.

42
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,473
Go back to the truck.

43
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:28,671
l'll finish up here.

44
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,115
Glove.

45
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:36,633
Ninety seconds. Perfect.

46
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:41,431
Send down the lift.

47
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:46,875
Yeah.

48
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:49,709
l don't think so.

49
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:53,271
What? What are you talking about?

50
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:57,913
The first conversation that
we ever had. No fucking guns!

51
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:00,390
You listen to me, Jaster.

52
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:03,315
You send down that fucking lift!

53
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:06,273
-Fuck you, you freak show!
-What are you doing?

54
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:09,029
No!

55
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:10,469
Wait.

56
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:12,398
Wait!

57
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:46,913
Crazy motherfucker!

58
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:52,750
No!

59
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:54,950
Stop!

60
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:02,115
<i>--frigid weather conditions</i>
<i>continue to pound the New York area.</i>

61
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,513
You fucking nuts?

62
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:07,235
No.

63
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:23,239
l'm fine.

64
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:26,996
Thanks for your concern.

65
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:31,159
-What the hell is wrong with him?
-Hold on.

66
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:33,476
He's really disrespecting
my speed right now.

67
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:36,592
He's about to bite me in the ass.
Disrespecting your speed?

68
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,438
Where the hell they get a Doberman?

69
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:40,835
Where's a nice, slow rottweiler
when you need him?

70
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:43,838
You cased it for months
and didn't see a 200-pound dog?

71
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:47,271
They was puppies when l saw them.
All right.

72
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:49,431
On three, you go right, l'll go left.

73
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:53,076
Fuck that. l go wrong all the time.
l'm going right.

74
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:54,599
Okay, brother, whatever.

75
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:56,552
One, two, three, break out.

76
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:59,674
Gotta hurry.
Yeah, what you want now, huh?

77
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:02,713
One-on-one.
lt's me and you, baby. Me and you.

78
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:07,833
Well, it can just be you.
lt can just be you.

79
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:12,557
How long does it take to
get these out of development?

80
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:17,237
Because, you know, l been working
on my little portfolio.

81
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:21,914
You're lucky l pulled my hamstring.

82
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:24,196
Y'all would still be chasing me.

83
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:27,312
You're saying that your partner
was a midget on a skateboard?

84
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:31,559
Midgets is taking over. They took
over this playground where l live.

85
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:34,115
They got this whole little
midget underworld.

86
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:37,229
lt's crazy.

87
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:40,830
They squeezing us out because
they selling everything half-price.

88
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:42,268
l'm innocent, yo.

89
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:44,118
Oh, innocent, huh?

90
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:47,478
Man, if you didn't have a gun,
l'd whup your ass.

91
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:50,434
Where'd you get this then, huh?
A cocktail party?

92
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,916
-What do you got?
-We got nothing.

93
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:22,790
Both shot in the back of the head,
execution-style.

94
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:27,188
Could be a 9 mil or a .38.
l couldn't find any empty shells.

95
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:31,795
They died about three hours ago,
l would say.

96
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,392
All right, listen up.

97
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:51,310
My name is Edgar Clenteen.

98
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:55,389
l'm the chief investigator, Special
Projects Unit, U.S. Treasury Dept.

99
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:57,517
This is my crime scene.

100
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:59,870
And you all are contaminating it.

101
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:01,998
We got two young men here. . .

102
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:04,879
. . .executed inside one of
the most secure rooms on earth.

103
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:08,874
So whatever you find, l don't care
what it is, you bring it to me.

104
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:12,157
l will not have anyone
fucking up this investigation.

105
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:15,678
Now get out of here.

106
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,195
Let Forensics do their work.

107
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:22,111
Go on. Get out.

108
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:40,673

109
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:43,030
We ran an AFlS match
on the fingerprint.

110
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:47,876
John Delano Jaster, a heavy-equipment
operator with two prior felonies.

111
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:50,998
-Where the hell do l find him?
-He's at Rikers.

112
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:54,311
-Who's this?
<i>-Well, who is this?</i>

113
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:58,433
John Jaster, asshole. You're in
my house. Put my wife on the phone.

114
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:01,712
<i>Oh, hey, Mr. Jaster.</i>
<i>Your wife stepped out.</i>

115
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:03,911
She told me to get the phone. . .

116
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:06,310
. . .in case this was you
and, you know, it was.

117
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:07,475
<i>Who are you?</i>

118
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:11,992
l'm just here fixing the heat. ls
there a number she can reach you at. . .

119
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:15,715
<i>...or a message or something?</i>
<i>She has been worried sick about you.</i>

120
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:18,480
-You fix the heat, huh?
<i>-Yeah, that's right.</i>

121
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:20,113
Let me tell you something.

122
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:24,393
Lady said you'd never go for it, but
you'd save yourself a lot of grief. . .

123
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:26,238
. . .you put in a new thermostat.

124
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:30,353
<i>Don 't worry about my thermostat.</i>
<i>Tell my wife that I'm in Rikers.</i>

125
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:31,913
Oh, you don't say?

126
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:35,914
Just tell her to get her ass
down here and get me out.

127
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:39,391
Don't worry about it, pal.
l'll be sure to tell her.

128
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:41,595
Jerk-off.

129
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:48,956
Oh, that was your husband.

130
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:53,228
He wants you to get him out of jail.

131
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:56,274
But you've had a difficult day.

132
00:14:58,360 --> 00:14:59,998
Why don't l do it?

133
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:18,434
Good morning, sir.

134
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:20,915
l'd better not be wasting my time.

135
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:23,873
Wooly, what do you got?

136
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:26,680
Jaster's in a holding cell
with an Alvin Sanders.

137
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:30,429
Some guy they picked up on a petty
theft heist for stealing shrimp.

138
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:32,631
-Shrimp?
-Shrimp.

139
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:39,516
That's pure nerve gas. You can use
that shit for weapons and shit.

140
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:41,638
You burned the hairs out my nose.

141
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:45,674
l see why they arrested you.
They gotta protect the public.

142
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:50,192
l'm sorry. l suppose
you smell like daffodils.

143
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:55,431
You should be mad at your ass.
You and your ass should get a divorce.

144
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:58,718
-l don't feel good.
-Well, that makes two of us.

145
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:02,595
Did you eat some shit on a half shell?
Yeah, grunt. Get it out.

146
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:05,439
See, that's--
Yo, what's up? What's up, man?

147
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:07,114
lt's my heart.

148
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:09,914
Yo, guard!
We need a doctor in here right now!

149
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:14,115
-What's up?
-The pills. Get the pills.

150
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:17,790
Hold on. l'm coming, l'm coming.

151
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,798
All right. All right, just relax.
You all right?

152
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,116
l'm gonna get somebody
for you, all right?

153
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:24,839
-Alvin.
-Yeah.

154
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:28,833
-ls that your name?
-Yeah.

155
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:32,589
You probably know me. The shrimp
heist, but it was actually prawns.

156
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:38,349
-lf l don't make it--
-Oh, come on with that.

157
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:41,677
Can you just listen?
This is important.

158
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:44,953
l need you to get
a message to my wife.

159
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:47,708
Tell her. . .

160
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:50,309
. . .that she should go
to the Bronx Zoo.

161
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:55,235
-Yeah. The Bronx Zoo. All right.
-Please.

162
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:58,910
Tell her, ''There's no place
like home. ''

163
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:01,517
What about Toto. . .

164
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:03,717
. . .and, you know,
the yellow brick road?

165
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:05,638
What kind of pills you taking?

166
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:06,989
Are you through?

167
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:10,677
You get that message to her.

168
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:20,473
l'll make it worth your while.

169
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:25,150
Cool, cool.
Now, what if you do make it?

170
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:28,631
You still break a brother off?
l need some change in my pocket.

171
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:37,916
Damn, he already shit all over--

172
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:40,116
Hands over your head and don't move.

173
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:43,830
Drag this piece of crap upstairs.

174
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:51,269
Dude was already sick. He was about
to die. What's wrong with you?

175
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:53,838
Don't treat him like that.

176
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:56,110
Don't treat him
like an animal like that.

177
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:59,956
Y'all push him around. lf it was me,
l wouldn't take that bullshit.

178
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:04,309
Are you a doctor?

179
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:07,758
We're ready here, sir.

180
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:10,117
You been working out, huh?

181
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:11,309
Sir?

182
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:15,392
Yeah, you better talk to him, boy.

183
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:19,229
You lucky these bars here.
You don't know who you fooling--

184
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:20,509
Okay, you coming back.

185
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:22,756
l'll be right up here
getting my sleep.

186
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:24,188
l'll whup your ass.

187
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:27,790
You don't know who you just
grabbed up on. l'm a gangster.

188
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,115
l see you coming.

189
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:31,470
Come here where there's no light,
l'll whup you.

190
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:33,750
You got your boys
with your billy sticks.

191
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:37,919
l'm Alvin, baby, king of the seafood.
They know me around these corridors.

192
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:47,595
Explain it to me, John.

193
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:52,032
How do you steal 40 million in gold
and not have the cash to make bail?

194
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:54,475
l don't know
what you're talking about.

195
00:18:58,160 --> 00:18:59,673
l'm out of aspirin.

196
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:01,673
Could you get me some?

197
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:04,635
Chewable.

198
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:10,713
How'd it happen?

199
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:14,511
How do you pull
the heist of the decade. . .

200
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:17,439
. . .and get busted for a DWl?

201
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:25,998
What kind of man. . .

202
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:27,997
. . .goes out celebrating. . .

203
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:31,113
. . .after he pops two boys
in the back of the head?

204
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:32,878
Look, l didn't. . . .

205
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:37,397
You're not hanging that on me.

206
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:40,392
They were on the floor. . .

207
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:42,959
. . .facedown.

208
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,629
lt was an execution, pure and simple.

209
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:50,195
No guns, man.

210
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:54,799
Look, l'm a contractor.
l'm no fucking shooter!

211
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:56,234
Then who?

212
00:19:58,240 --> 00:19:59,878
Just give me the names.

213
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:01,678
A name. lt was just. . . .

214
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:04,430
There was just one other guy.
lt was me and him.

215
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:09,112
-Bullshit. Bullshit!
-One guy. One guy!

216
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:10,594
l swear it.

217
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:13,589
Computer is what this guy's got.

218
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:17,235
He's got the whole government wired.

219
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:24,549
Who?

220
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:27,356
Come on, Jaster, tell me who.

221
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:31,232
Give me the goddamn name, Jaster.
Just give me a name.

222
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:35,595
Please, listen to me.

223
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:37,678
Get me a doctor.

224
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:43,274
Get me a doctor. Please.

225
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:46,154
-l'll give you a name.
-You're giving me a brain tumor.

226
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:50,797
You give me a pass,
l'll give you the fucking gold!

227
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:54,951
Nobody knows where it is
but me, you know.

228
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:02,954
Did you burn your partner?

229
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:04,758
l need a doctor.

230
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:08,192
You took the gold
and left him there, didn't you?

231
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:13,308
No wonder you drank. You figured
jail was the best place to lay low.

232
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:14,919
Just keep pulling my chain. . .

233
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:18,391
. . .keep on with
with this happy horseshit. . .

234
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:21,234
. . .l'll make sure
you do need a doctor.

235
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:33,235
-Ed?
-What, goddamn it?!

236
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:35,431
l don't think he's faking.

237
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:42,956
Damn, l was just trying
to have a good meal.

238
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:45,599
Damn!

239
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:48,190
And l just thought you had gas.

240
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:49,753
Oh, shit.

241
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:52,516
-What the hell?
-Get in there.

242
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:54,349
Move it.

243
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:00,478
You lucky. Oh, you lucky.

244
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,353
Sit down, Alvin.

245
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:07,829
Not there.

246
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:10,799
Oh, yeah. Got reserved seats.

247
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:15,318
Watching the game?

248
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:17,753
Big screen.

249
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:21,033
Hey, look, l apologize. . .

250
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:23,714
. . .about that irreverent shit
l displayed in the cell.

251
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:25,672
l was out of line.

252
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:27,871
l had been lifting weights. . .

253
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:31,590
. . .and l just got through doing curls,
so l was real tense.

254
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:32,869
Hey, Alvin?

255
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:36,753
l got some good news.

256
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:40,351
And bad news.
Want to hear the good news?

257
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:42,790
Yeah, l mean, good news is great.

258
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:46,758
You're fucked.
Want to hear the bad news?

259
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:49,315
l think you just told me the bad news.

260
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:51,397
Unless you want to tell me
worser news.

261
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:53,431
You're alone in a room with me.

262
00:23:57,920 --> 00:23:59,273
Yeah, right.

263
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:02,673
So, what you want?

264
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:05,432
You and. . . .

265
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:10,391
You and Jaster were alone
in that cell for eight hours.

266
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:12,155
All alone.

267
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:14,396
You must have talked about something.

268
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:16,553
His bowels.

269
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:20,197
He was shitting and coughing
and it didn't smell good.

270
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:22,868
How do you talk to somebody like that?

271
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:25,632
-lt's terrible.
-Alvin.

272
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:29,671
l do this for a living.

273
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:33,873
You think l can't see that
you're hiding something?

274
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:40,636
Okay, everybody out.

275
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:48,512
Alvin, think about Jaster. . .

276
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:52,469
. . .and tell me
where you want the bruises.

277
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:55,754
You trying to try
some sneaky shit, huh?

278
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:59,032
Gonna fool me with the quiet voice
while you beat on my body.

279
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:01,834
You can do that,
but you can't beat on my soul.

280
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:04,952
Do the words ''Stokley Carmichael''
mean anything to y'all?

281
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:07,919
Reverend Malcolm X?
Reverend Al Sharpton?

282
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:10,116
l see you taking off your Timex.

283
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:13,278
l ain't telling you shit nor
the brothers behind the aquarium.

284
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:15,311
You can kiss my ass
with your tongue. . .

285
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:17,795
. . .and l will take
this information to my grave.

286
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:21,310
The man said something
about the Bronx Zoo, okay?

287
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:47,950
Well?

288
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:50,430
We completed our search
of The World of Darkness.

289
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:54,713
That would be your bats,
your leopard cats, your mole rats.

290
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:56,558
We came up empty, sir.

291
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:00,156
''There's no place like home. ''

292
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:04,400
-lt's gotta be a building.
-We checked them all.

293
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:07,637
We checked the monkey house,
the reptile house, the giraffe house.

294
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:09,273
Even the outhouse.

295
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:12,040
We scanned the entire grounds
to a depth of 20 feet.

296
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:14,037
This guy was
a heavy-equipment operator.

297
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:17,192
Five minutes with a machine,
he could've buried the gold anywhere.

298
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:19,231
So where does that leave us, sir?

299
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:21,232
Square-fucking-one.

300
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:25,870
Come on, let's go
check the outhouse again.

301
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:27,155
Let's go.

302
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:38,190
<i>We have a national security crisis.</i>

303
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:42,632
Citadel 4 is the same system we use
to safeguard our nuclear facilities.

304
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:45,991
This guy took it apart like
he was hot-wiring a Toyota.

305
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:48,551
l'll give you the short version.

306
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:51,750
We're talking world-class loner.

307
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:56,033
A guy who spent literally tens
of thousands of hours at a computer. . .

308
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:58,953
. . .feeling around in the dark.
Nothing but math.

309
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,679
Nothing but numbers.

310
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:06,435
His sense of well-being, his very
sanity is predicated on completion.

311
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:09,394
Only this time,
the equation is incomplete.

312
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:13,673
He didn't get the 42 million in gold
he'd worked so very hard for.

313
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:15,798
That's our edge.

314
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:21,599
Now this. . . .

315
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:27,469
This is what l need your money for.

316
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:32,037
lt's a BC-1 9.

317
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:34,676
lt's an experimental tracking device.

318
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:37,189
Dr. Harris here can fill you in.

319
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:40,392
Well, it's quite simple, really.

320
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,434
The BC-1 9 has a proprietary signal. . .

321
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:46,029
. . .broadcast and location.

322
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:49,755
lt's got a 1 0-mile radius and
full satellite coordinate tracking.

323
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:52,235
Now, the optimum placement site. . .

324
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:55,671
. . .is the temporal mandibular joint.

325
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:57,791
lt's just below the jaw.

326
00:27:58,200 --> 00:27:59,394
All right, look. . .

327
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:03,275
. . .we implant this in
the appropriate subject, put him. . .

328
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:06,872
. . .on the street, make it known
he knows where the gold is. . .

329
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:10,317
. . .and l guarantee that our elusive
computer whiz will show up.

330
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:14,513
Who would be willing to have
that thing implanted in their jaw?

331
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:16,155
Senator. . .

332
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:18,796
. . .we already have a volunteer.

333
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:24,869
This is Howard Cosell.

334
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:26,599
Down goes Frazier!

335
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:38,595
Come on.

336
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:42,238
Tenderize that bitch, Alvin.

337
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:44,749
-What you got?
-l got all kinds of shit.

338
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:46,393
Chest, chest, chest, nuts!

339
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:48,950
What do you know about boxing?

340
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:50,997
l ain't gotta box.
l get my skills from TV.

341
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:53,629
l got Mike Tyson skills.
You biting me!

342
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,230
My ears, my ears!

343
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:00,951
l'll go Muhammad Ali on them.

344
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:03,033
-That's cold.
-That ain't right.

345
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:04,508
That ain't right.

346
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:08,076
Once l get out of here, l'll get
my big score. l'll be set for life.

347
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:09,872
l'll get me a 1 -year-old Arabian.

348
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:11,997
A 1 -year-old?
What sick shit is that?

349
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:15,869
l'm talking horses. Thoroughbreds.
They got royalty in their blood.

350
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:18,668
-What you know about horses?
-l know everything.

351
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:21,189
My father took me to the horse track.

352
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:22,799
Taught me everything
about thoroughbreds.

353
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:26,151
l'm teaching you awareness here.
See, l'm always aware.

354
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:30,148
Stay aware of everything.
Are you watching? Watch my skills.

355
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:33,432
l'm always aware. See my eyes?
l'm on a swivel.

356
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:36,718
Can't nobody sneak up on you
and just get with you. That's--

357
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:08,872
Mr. Clenteen, exactly how many laws
are we breaking here?

358
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:12,039
You don't want to know.

359

Ladies and gentlemen.

360
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:26,480
You've all distinguished yourselves.

361
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:29,400
You're all the best at what you do.

362
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:32,593

And as of this moment. . .

366
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:43,515
. . .nothing else in your lives exists.

367
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:46,718
You no longer exist.

368
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:51,199
Welcome aboard.

369
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:53,432
Don't disappoint me.

Sir, l'm in.

380
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:30,556
Ed, you actually think this guy is
surfing Treasury Department files?

381
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:33,832
What if he can't decode this?
We can make a less secure encryption.

382
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:37,430
Maybe we should indicate we think
Sanders knows where the gold is.

383
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:42,553
Listen to me. l had a grandfather
who was a trapper by profession.

384
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:47,758
Now he had two prices
on his card: wolf. . .

385
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:49,916
. . .and everything else.

386
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:52,432
<i>Now a wolf...</i>

387
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:55,430
<i>... will starve itself to death...</i>

388
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:57,631
<i>...rather than make a mistake.</i>

389
00:31:58,440 --> 00:32:03,195
You have to lay down a scent
that smells real from far away.

390
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:05,319
<i>And the bait...</i>

391
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:09,638
<i>...has to be fresh</i>
<i>and untouched by human hands.</i>

392
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:12,668
<i>And make no mistake about it...</i>

393
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:16,193
<i>... we are hunting wolf.</i>

-NSA, please.

A secret, huh?

411
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:33,677
l love a secret.

412
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:38,915
Alvin. . .

413
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:41,914
. . .do you feel like a lucky man?

414
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:46,437
No. Yes.
Well, it depends on what you. . . .

00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:50,157
Of all the many crimes
that men commit. . .

-You're right, you're right.
-You understand me?

419
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:00,875
No, sir.

420
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:02,315
Mr. Sanders. . .

421
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:04,915
. . .you were arrested and booked. . .

422
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:07,475
. . .by a police officer
named Wayne Miller for. . .

. . .theft of shrimp.

424
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:11,880
Well, you know,
actually they were prawns.

425
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:15,795
You know the big jumbo shrimp
that's, like, at least a dollar--

426
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,560
Six weeks ago,
in an internal investigation. . .

427
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:21,797

of falsifying evidence.

Thank God for people
that come forward.

431
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:33,268
Needless to say, we've been petitioned
to repudiate the convictions.

432
00:34:33,680 --> 00:34:35,033
Repudiation is what--

433
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:37,879
What everybody needs more of
is a little repudiation.

434
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:40,680
Now, repudiation is. . . .
Use it in a sentence.

435
00:34:42,160 --> 00:34:44,720
l have a short sentence
for you, Alvin.

436
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:46,956

Okay, let's take it for a spin.

00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:05,998
You damn right l am.

516
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:12,471
Oh, my God. Alvin?

517
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:15,678
What up?
You going on a date behind my back?

518
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:17,154
Fuck you, Alvin.

519
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:20,591
That's music to my ears.
Where do you want it? The couch?

520
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:24,509
You disappear for two years, then have
the nerve to ask about my life?

521
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:25,869
Fuck you, Alvin.

522
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:29,351
You mean, like really ''fuck you''
fuck you? Like ''motherfuck you''?

523
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:32,669
Bad move, Alvin.
Can't be too jealous.

524
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:35,030
<i>-Turn around and walk out.</i>
<i>-I got you flowers.</i>

525
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:37,191
Oh, thank you. Now you can leave.

526
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:40,631
You need to pump your brakes
and recognize that your man is home.

527
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:43,149
So, what happened, Alvin?
You escaped?

528
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:46,079
Yeah, we had to tunnel out.
lt was terrible.

529
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:49,431
They released the dogs. They caught
up with me and my whole crew.

530
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:52,992
<i>Harriet Tubman, Kunta Kinte.</i>
<i>Harriet don 't move like she used to.</i>

531
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:55,037
The dogs was chewing all on her ass.

532
00:39:55,240 --> 00:39:59,597
You know what, l don't have time
for this random gibberish.

533
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:02,310
There was a dirty cop
so they let me go.

534
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:04,677
Congratulations. Now leave.

535
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:06,199
You don't mean that.

536
00:40:06,680 --> 00:40:09,752
How come you didn't come see me?
You didn't write me or nothing.

537
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:13,669
l was going to come see you.
l was gonna write you and tell--

538
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:15,435
You wouldn't understand.

539
00:40:15,640 --> 00:40:19,235
l wouldn't understand? l don't
understand why we ain't celebrating.

540
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:20,919
l'm out. l'm back home.

541
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:23,469
Home? No, see, this is my house.

542
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:26,752
l pay the bills, l pay the rent.
You pay. . .?

543
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:28,959
Exactly. Excuse me.

544
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:32,391
You're upset. Stevie was the one
behind the whole thing.

545
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:34,272
l was on my way to church.

546
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:36,630
The next thing l know, l'm stealing.

547
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:40,799
Stevie? l don't remember hearing
anything about Stevie going to jail.

548
00:40:41,720 --> 00:40:44,837
Lisa, look at me. Do l look
like l've been in day camp?

549
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:47,629
l been around hard-core criminals.

550
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:49,990
l'd like something soft
up against my body.

551
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:53,158
l'd like to have a home-cooked meal,
a hug from my woman.

552
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:54,713
What about a table dance?

553
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:57,591
-Prison has changed me.
-Oh, really?

554
00:40:57,800 --> 00:41:01,634
Yes, it has. And l'm ready
for responsibility. What is that?

555
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:04,438
What do you think it is?

556
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:06,234
A puppy, l hope.

557
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:08,319
lt's not a puppy.

558
00:41:09,360 --> 00:41:11,237
What you been doing since l been gone?

559
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:16,599
What's going on?

560
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:17,869
Sweetie.

561
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:24,517
This is your son, Alvin.

562
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:26,518
That ain't my son.

563
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:27,914
You think l made it up?

564
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:29,275
l don't know.

565
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:32,429
l mean, how?

566
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:36,679
How? That night,
after Stevie's birthday party.

567
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:41,356
Yeah, we did and. . .

568
00:41:41,560 --> 00:41:42,709
. . .wow.

569
00:41:45,560 --> 00:41:49,633
He don't really look like me.
He kind of chubby, ain't got no teeth.

570
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:51,719
Kind of cute.

571
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:55,512
Can l hold him?

572
00:41:57,240 --> 00:41:59,674
Don't be like that.
Can l hold my son?

573
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:02,716
He calling for his daddy anyway.

574
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:04,759
Please?

575
00:42:15,720 --> 00:42:18,712
l cannot believe this. Look at this!

576
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:20,678
Doesn't it trip you out?

577
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:23,708
Me and you, and the next thing
you know, we got this.

578
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:26,878
lt's like half and half,
l guess, you know.

579
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:29,999
-He'll be a little player.
-He won't be a player.

580
00:42:31,240 --> 00:42:34,915
He's strong. Look at that grip.
Big old fella.

581
00:42:36,680 --> 00:42:39,672
l think he sprung a leak.
He kind of smells.

582
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:42,311
Never mind, Alvin.

583
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:46,514
l'm going to work. The babysitter
will be here in five minutes.

584
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:54,999
Come on, Lisa.

585
00:42:55,240 --> 00:42:58,915
Just give me another chance.
l'll get out there, l'll get a job.

586
00:42:59,160 --> 00:43:01,993
Take care of myself.
l'll take care of you.

587
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:06,552
We got a whole little family.
Don't squeeze me out of that.

588
00:43:07,640 --> 00:43:09,676
You know, Alvin,
it's been really hard.

589
00:43:09,880 --> 00:43:12,553
l know. lt's hard for everybody.

590
00:43:19,320 --> 00:43:22,630
Okay, but you gotta prove yourself.

591
00:43:22,840 --> 00:43:24,239
-You gotta get a job.
-l'll get that.

592
00:43:24,440 --> 00:43:27,159
-Stay out of jail.
-l don't remember how to get to jail.

593
00:43:27,560 --> 00:43:29,312
And stop dressing like a thug.

594
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:31,192
l'll get a new Versace, Gucci.

595
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:32,628
Maybe l'll consider--

596
00:43:32,840 --> 00:43:35,434
-Making love to your man?
-Having dinner with you.

597
00:43:35,640 --> 00:43:39,872
You'll like the way l cook.
While l was in there, taught me how.

598
00:43:40,120 --> 00:43:41,633
l can cook you anything.

599
00:43:41,840 --> 00:43:45,799
French. <i>Bon giorno.</i>
l can cook ltalian. <i>Ciao, bella.</i>

600
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:47,752
Or l can cook, like, soul food.

601
00:43:47,960 --> 00:43:50,599
''Daisy, check your greens.
They done spoiled now. ''

602
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:52,631
-Goodbye, Alvin.
-Can l get a kiss?

603
00:43:54,160 --> 00:43:57,277
-Goodbye, Alvin.
-All right. Take it easy.

604
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:01,679
-Lisa?
-Yes?

605
00:44:02,120 --> 00:44:03,997
What's my son's name?

606
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:07,518
-His name is Gregory.
-Gregory.

607
00:44:08,280 --> 00:44:09,633
Gregory.

608
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:13,271
G-Dog! That's all right.

609
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:17,913
That's your daddy.

610
00:44:21,320 --> 00:44:24,278
l think old Alvin just
might make it this time.

611
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:29,156
Alvin Sanders is bait.

612
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:32,038
That's all he is.

613
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:35,558
When he's served his purpose. . .

614
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:38,433
. . .when he draws our man
out of the shadows. . . .

615
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:42,950
Well, you know what happens to bait.

616
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:50,790
Well, well, well.

617
00:45:03,600 --> 00:45:05,716
<i>Sequence complete.</i>

618
00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:13,834
Look at this shit.

619
00:45:14,200 --> 00:45:15,155
Clown.

620
00:45:15,360 --> 00:45:17,032
Sushi chef.

621
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:19,558
Male exotic dancer.

622
00:45:20,120 --> 00:45:21,951
That might be all right.

623
00:45:25,240 --> 00:45:26,514
What's cracking?

624
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:29,793
<i>Yes, I'm looking</i>
<i>for a Mr. Alvin Sanders.</i>

625
00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:33,518
l do not know if
a Mr. Sanders is around.

626
00:45:33,720 --> 00:45:34,914
Who is calling?

627
00:45:35,160 --> 00:45:38,789
<i>My name is Rhonda Glimsher.</i>
<i>I'm a student at Columbia University.</i>

628

-Trace it.

629
00:45:41,480 --> 00:45:44,631
<i>-Excuse me? You said ''Master P''?</i>
<i>-Master's degree.</i>

630

631
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:47,992
No, wait. Dublin.

632
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:49,912
No, l got it. Madrid!

633
00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:51,912
This is Mobile 1 . We're on it.

634
00:45:53,400 --> 00:45:54,355
Orlando?

635
00:45:54,560 --> 00:45:55,913
<i>I was given Mr. Sanders ' name...</i>

636
00:45:56,160 --> 00:45:58,230
. . .from the Department
of Corrections.

637
00:45:58,440 --> 00:46:01,113
Sons of bitches. Anyway, go on.

638
00:46:01,320 --> 00:46:02,958
Going through a call diverter!

639
00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:06,038
-Nothing.
-Give me 63 again.

640
00:46:06,280 --> 00:46:07,474
Got the location.

641
00:46:08,560 --> 00:46:11,028
<i>Air unit, Mobile 1</i>
<i>requesting visual support.</i>

642
00:46:11,960 --> 00:46:15,270

as part of my thesis. . .

643
00:46:15,480 --> 00:46:18,756
. . .and l'm paying 200 dollars
per interview.

644
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:20,439
What? 200 dollars?

645
00:46:21,680 --> 00:46:22,874
lt's a skipped signal.

646
00:46:23,120 --> 00:46:24,269
Not isolating frequency.

647
00:46:24,560 --> 00:46:27,313
-Try a back-end patch.
-What do you think l'm doing?

648
00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:29,238
Are you Mr. Sanders?

649
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:32,557
l am not him, but l am Mr. Sanders' . . .

Tel Aviv. Where is he?!

653
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:41,353
l must be sure you're not lying.
Mr. Sanders doesn't like that.

654
00:46:41,560 --> 00:46:43,630
<i>Mr. Sanders could get upset...</i>

655
00:46:43,840 --> 00:46:46,513
. . .and pop cap in ass.
You ever been capped and popped?

656
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:48,870
-Going to original patch.
-Showing 1 3 countries!

We got nothing here!

664
00:47:10,920 --> 00:47:11,875
He's gone.

665
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:23,797
l've never seen anything like this.

666
00:47:25,560 --> 00:47:26,788
lt was him.

667
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:29,799
He crawled out from the dark. . .

668
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:31,877
. . .and he fucking bit.

669
00:47:50,440 --> 00:47:51,793
Boss, boss, boss.

670
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:53,558

671
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:56,149
-May l help you?
-Yeah, l'm looking for a job.

673
00:47:58,640 --> 00:48:01,598
. . .but if not, l'll work my way up
from the washroom.

674
00:48:01,800 --> 00:48:03,313
Wait tables or whatever.

675
00:48:03,520 --> 00:48:05,351
l had a couple problems, okay?

676
00:48:05,560 --> 00:48:07,790
But everything is cool now.

677
00:48:10,680 --> 00:48:12,955
Didn't you rob me a few years ago?

678
00:48:14,680 --> 00:48:16,238
You walked in with a skinny guy. . .

679
00:48:16,440 --> 00:48:19,591
. . .picked up my cash register
and ran out the door with it.

680

No, that wasn't me.
l don't hang out with thin dudes.

681
00:48:25,640 --> 00:48:28,313
Your friend got away.
l picked you out of the lineup.

00:48:28,840 --> 00:48:30,796
Number four. You were number four!

683
00:48:31,160 --> 00:48:33,674
l was number four in high school

697
00:49:04,440 --> 00:49:06,954
Damn! Getting a job
is getting dangerous.

698

<i>-I just wanted a job.</i>
-Oh, fuck.

Maybe you picked the wrong guy.

701
00:49:17,520 --> 00:49:18,635
Or not.

702
00:49:37,360 --> 00:49:40,477
<i>Give me another chance.</i>
<i>I'll get out there. I'll get a job.</i>

703

<i>Take care of myself,</i>

<i>It is not stolen.</i>
<i>Man, it is cold outside.</i>

You know me. l'll go through

00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:39,031
Why you got to be my brother?

We're fine. Look, baby--

724

00:50:43,360 --> 00:50:45,794
l'm gonna rock this box
in your ear.

726
00:50:46,040 --> 00:50:47,837
l don't feel like listening--

727
00:50:48,120 --> 00:50:49,348
Who that?

728
00:51:20,760 --> 00:51:23,752
We're on the <i>5</i>9th Street Bridge,
headed into the city.

729
00:51:27,800 --> 00:51:29,199
This ain't the way home.

730
00:51:29,400 --> 00:51:31,755
We got some business to take care of.

731
00:51:32,880 --> 00:51:34,632
Steven, l told you, man--

732
00:51:34,840 --> 00:51:36,273
Just sit back and relax.

733
00:51:36,480 --> 00:51:39,916
You riding with something like a pimp.
l'm something like a pimp.

734
00:51:41,040 --> 00:51:43,395
l'm supposed to be a pimp

l'm something like a pimp.

He just made a left off 2nd.
Moving east on Canal.

00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:03,913
He's going to the docks.

738
00:52:04,120 --> 00:52:07,954
According to this file on Steve,
that's where he makes his pickups.

739
00:52:22,200 --> 00:52:23,838
This way, gentlemen.

740
00:52:32,360 --> 00:52:34,794
l pulled a bust sheet from NYPD
and guess what?

741
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:38,231
They got an undercover special
going down tonight at Pier 27.

742
00:52:38,440 --> 00:52:41,671
Christ! That stupid son of a bitch
is about to get pinched.

743
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:43,638
Mobile 3, move in.

Pull the car over.

Alvin, you're ex-con.
You just got out of the penitentiary.

748
00:52:54,400 --> 00:52:57,551
You got 26 dollars in your pocket,
2<i>5</i> of it is mine.

749
00:52:57,760 --> 00:52:59,159
-Pull over.
-l'm not pulling--

750
00:52:59,360 --> 00:53:03,273
-Get your finger out my face.
-Get your finger out my face.

-Hello?
-Give me this phone.

758
00:53:17,960 --> 00:53:20,235
-Yo, Stevie.
<i>-Yeah, Julio? Ramundo?</i>

759
00:53:20,440 --> 00:53:23,238
He can't come to the phone.
He banging your girlfriend.

760
00:53:23,440 --> 00:53:25,556
-Give me the phone.
-''Ah, it's so good! ''

761
00:53:25,840 --> 00:53:28,354
<i>''It's not fair</i>

762
00:53:28,560 --> 00:53:29,470
<i>Give me the phone.</i>

763
00:53:31,920 --> 00:53:33,399
lt was that fuck, Alvin.

764
00:53:33,600 --> 00:53:35,955
Alvin?
That kid ain't nothing but trouble.

765
00:53:36,200 --> 00:53:37,758
Stop playing, man!

766
00:53:38,160 --> 00:53:39,957
l make 1 0 G's off them a week.

767
00:53:40,720 --> 00:53:42,233
-Ten G's?
-Yeah.

768
00:53:42,440 --> 00:53:45,079
Plus they sell food stamps.
l bought 1 60 for. . .

769
00:53:45,280 --> 00:53:47,236
. . .it was $80, something like that.

770
00:53:47,920 --> 00:53:49,399
-Ten G's?
-That's right.

771
00:53:54,920 --> 00:53:56,717
Turn left on East Broadway. . .

772
00:53:56,920 --> 00:53:58,478
. . .half a mile before they turn.

773
00:54:04,960 --> 00:54:07,679
Mobile 3. Do not
let him enter the docks.

774
00:54:07,880 --> 00:54:10,713
<i>-Do not let him make that turn.</i>
-Copy that.

775
00:54:24,320 --> 00:54:26,390
What the hell?!
What's going on?

776
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:33,753
<i>-What the hell's your problem, man?</i>
<i>-Oh, shit!</i>

777
00:54:36,200 --> 00:54:38,191
Did you jump out a cab and not pay?

778
00:54:41,920 --> 00:54:43,273
Quit talking and drive.

779
00:54:45,120 --> 00:54:46,678
This ain't no Cadillac!

780
00:54:46,880 --> 00:54:50,555
<i>You can 't run into me! This</i>
<i>ain 't no Buick! Do I know you?</i>

781
00:54:53,120 --> 00:54:56,157
-This dude's losing his mind.
-Pull over now! Right now!

782
00:54:56,360 --> 00:54:57,998
-He got a gun.
-To shoot you.

783
00:54:58,200 --> 00:55:00,475
-Don't you have a gun?
-Not with me.

784
00:55:00,680 --> 00:55:02,511
Pull the fucking car over!

785
00:55:02,720 --> 00:55:04,711
Use your finger. Get away!

786
00:55:07,840 --> 00:55:09,114
-Ain't working.
-l know.

787
00:55:11,760 --> 00:55:13,034
Trip around him!

788
00:55:13,280 --> 00:55:14,918
Handle your business, boy!

789
00:55:19,280 --> 00:55:20,190
Watch out!

790
00:55:29,600 --> 00:55:31,113
Take a right here.

791
00:55:48,360 --> 00:55:49,588
Damn! Shit.

792
00:55:56,520 --> 00:55:58,476
Damn, Stevie.
What the hell was that?

793
00:56:00,360 --> 00:56:02,316
Shit, man. We late.

794
00:56:03,040 --> 00:56:05,873
Come on, man. We can walk
to the docks from here.

795
00:56:06,160 --> 00:56:07,718
Come on. You with me?

796
00:56:09,240 --> 00:56:10,514
<i>Come on.</i>

797
00:56:16,200 --> 00:56:17,553
You with me?

798
00:56:22,040 --> 00:56:22,995
Come on.

799
00:56:23,240 --> 00:56:25,037
Can't be a fuck-up all your life.

800
00:56:25,240 --> 00:56:27,356
-He's moving.
-Direction?

801
00:56:29,600 --> 00:56:32,319
North on Jackson Street.

802
00:56:33,600 --> 00:56:35,511
Away from the docks.

803
00:56:46,120 --> 00:56:47,838
Fucking lowlife.

804
00:56:48,040 --> 00:56:50,156
You undercover piece of shit.

805
00:56:50,360 --> 00:56:52,590
Does your mother know
what you do for a living?

806
00:56:52,800 --> 00:56:54,552
That's real funny.

807
00:56:55,480 --> 00:56:56,595
Watch your head.

808
00:57:01,720 --> 00:57:04,314
l think l know why Stevie didn't show.

809
00:57:04,600 --> 00:57:06,318
l think he set us up.

810
00:57:07,280 --> 00:57:09,794
The minute we make bail, he's dead.

811
00:57:10,800 --> 00:57:12,995
Him and his brother, Alvin.

812
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:35,834
All right, l want every agent
working around the clock. . .

813
00:57:36,040 --> 00:57:39,191
. . .to keep this joker
out of the morgue and out of jail.

814
00:57:40,360 --> 00:57:43,397
He doesn't get so much
as a parking ticket or a hangnail.

815
00:57:48,120 --> 00:57:51,351
From now on, Alvin Sanders
leads a charmed life.

816
00:58:08,240 --> 00:58:09,992
Come on, come on.

817
00:58:10,520 --> 00:58:11,919
Alvin.

818
00:58:14,560 --> 00:58:15,879
Alvin, it's late.

819
00:58:16,120 --> 00:58:19,590
l know, but l really need
to talk to you right now.

820
00:58:20,560 --> 00:58:23,028
l got this for Gregory.

821
00:58:24,240 --> 00:58:27,550
-An egg?
-lt's supposed to be magic.

822
00:58:27,760 --> 00:58:29,876
Anyway, he can't swallow it.

823
00:58:30,520 --> 00:58:31,919
Can l come in?

824
00:58:33,200 --> 00:58:34,633
Just for a minute?

825
00:58:36,200 --> 00:58:37,792
All right, but keep it down.

826
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:40,036
-The baby's sleeping.
-All right.

827
00:58:48,280 --> 00:58:50,999
<i>Did I ever tell you</i>
<i>that I had a very happy childhood?</i>

828
00:58:51,200 --> 00:58:54,476
<i>-That's not what Stevie says.</i>
<i>-Stevie.</i>

829
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:59,278
Dad used to pick me up every day
to take the cargo train to Manhattan.

830
00:58:59,480 --> 00:59:01,914
Go to the horse track.
l knew it really well.

831
00:59:02,160 --> 00:59:04,116
l know. Your dad trained horses.

832
00:59:04,960 --> 00:59:05,915
Not really.

833
00:59:08,280 --> 00:59:10,794
No. No, he was a. . . .

834
00:59:11,320 --> 00:59:14,232
He was a groom. l lied about that.

835
00:59:17,480 --> 00:59:20,995
But he was a great groom.
With the thoroughbreds, he was magic.

836
00:59:21,840 --> 00:59:25,992
l say he was the best.
But, you know, job didn't pay shit.

837
00:59:27,560 --> 00:59:32,156
So, therefore, our Christmases,
we didn't get jack shit.

838
00:59:34,200 --> 00:59:35,838
Which really pissed him off.

839
00:59:36,040 --> 00:59:39,874
One day he just went to this toy store
and just stole all these toys.

840
00:59:40,120 --> 00:59:41,155
Robbed them.

841
00:59:41,360 --> 00:59:43,237
Brought the toys over to the crib.

842
00:59:43,440 --> 00:59:47,149
l was like, ''Damn, Santa Claus
got the wrong address or what?''
