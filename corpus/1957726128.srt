♪♪♪

2
00:03:03,922 --> 00:03:04,967
Good morning.

3
00:03:20,330 --> 00:03:26,641
- All rise. Department 116 of

The Honorable Judge Katherine A.
Woodbury presiding. Please be
seated. Come to order.

5
00:03:33,038 --> 00:03:34,257
- Good morning your honor.

6
00:03:34,431 --> 00:03:37,565
- Morning Millie. Docket
please.

7
00:03:37,739 --> 00:03:43,440
- Number one on the calendar.
Case 327 dash 03 dash 019.

8
00:03:43,614 --> 00:03:46,617
Alberta Johnson versus Henry
Guzman.

9
00:03:46,791 --> 00:03:51,405
Amendment to the child support
order and settlement of back
payments.

10
00:03:51,579 --> 00:03:59,282
Mr. Guzman's gross income is

rent free in company housing.

00:03:59,456 --> 00:04:08,291
Child support set last year at
$175.50 per week. No payments
made since May 15th.

12
00:04:08,465 --> 00:04:10,250
- You speak English, Mr.
Guzman?

13
00:04:10,424 --> 00:04:12,426
- Yes, ma'am.

14
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:16,343
- Then you understand the
agreement you made with this
court last year?

15
00:04:16,517 --> 00:04:18,823
- Yes ma'am.

16
00:04:18,997 --> 00:04:20,521
- Then honor it. Provide for
your son or go to jail. Those
are your options.

17
00:04:20,695 --> 00:04:23,524
Pay the bailiff and you may go.
Next.

18
00:04:23,698 --> 00:04:29,834
- Next, 06 dash 419. Ralph
Withers versus Mona Harley
Withers.

19
00:04:30,008 --> 00:04:32,533
- Uh, yes, we're working on a
settlement here, your honor.

20
00:04:32,707 --> 00:04:35,536
- Counselor, you're either
ready to try this case or I'll
rule for the plaintiff.

21
00:04:35,710 --> 00:04:36,537
Your choice.

22
00:04:36,711 --> 00:04:41,716
- Yes, your honor.

23
00:04:41,890 --> 00:04:50,681
- 517 dash 23 dash 774. Jenson
family petitioning the state for
termination of foster care.

24
00:04:50,855 --> 00:04:54,685
- The Jensons want to return
her to the state's custody.

25
00:04:54,859 --> 00:05:00,430
They feel she requires a
situation more fitting for a
young adult.

26
00:05:00,604 --> 00:05:01,649
- Mr. Jenson?

27
00:05:01,823 --> 00:05:06,480
- Ma'am.

28
00:05:06,654 --> 00:05:08,482
Ma'am, my wife and I
don't want anyone to think

29
00:05:08,656 --> 00:05:10,440
we aren't good citizens or
that we don't care.

30
00:05:10,614 --> 00:05:12,834
- No one's suggesting
anything of the kind.

31
00:05:13,008 --> 00:05:15,402
- We've tried our very best
with Sally.

32
00:05:15,576 --> 00:05:17,491
It's the lying, it's the
stealing.

33
00:05:17,665 --> 00:05:21,843
- She took our car. Her and her
boyfriend. Uh, twice.

34
00:05:22,017 --> 00:05:25,499
- Is the girl here?

35
00:05:25,673 --> 00:05:28,589
Sally, is that true, did you
steal the Jenson's car.

36
00:05:28,763 --> 00:05:30,808
- It's not stealing if you
bring it back.

37
00:05:30,982 --> 00:05:34,421
- She took some money, also,
your honor. From my wife's
purse. 50 bucks.

38
00:05:34,595 --> 00:05:37,032
- I didn't take your stupid
money.

39
00:05:37,206 --> 00:05:39,556
- I can't deal with it anymore.

40
00:05:39,730 --> 00:05:44,387
But we've tried our best with
Sally, but she just, doesn't
make an effort.

41
00:05:44,561 --> 00:05:47,695
She doesn't fit in, you know
what I mean?

42
00:05:47,869 --> 00:05:51,612
- Very well, the State Of
California assumes custody of
Miss Sally Ann Powell until such

43
00:05:51,786 --> 00:05:54,571
time as an appropriate foster
family can be secured.

44
00:05:54,745 --> 00:05:57,531
- County homes are at capacity
your honor.

45
00:05:57,705 --> 00:05:58,880
- Well, then we'll send her
some place else.

46
00:05:59,054 --> 00:06:00,882
Who's here from Child Welfare?

47
00:06:01,056 --> 00:06:04,015
- Not a soul. Pretty much
everyone's left.

48
00:06:04,189 --> 00:06:06,801
- Well, this is absurd. The
child has to go somewhere.

49
00:06:15,897 --> 00:06:20,684
The court remands Sally Powell
the Juvenile Correctional
Facility.

50
00:06:20,858 --> 00:06:24,079
We're going to revisit the case
in three weeks, right after
recess.

51
00:06:24,253 --> 00:06:25,559
- That's it, ma'am.

52
00:06:25,733 --> 00:06:27,604
- Thank you everyone.

53
00:06:27,778 --> 00:06:30,564
- All rise. The court is now in
recess.

54
00:06:32,217 --> 00:06:36,918
- I don't know. Putting a
minor in jail because foster
care is full.

55
00:06:37,092 --> 00:06:39,573
How ridiculous is
that?

56
00:06:39,747 --> 00:06:42,358
- It seems like she's got a
little petty larceny going on
there, too.

57
00:06:42,532 --> 00:06:43,881
- Ah.

58
00:06:44,055 --> 00:06:46,144
- Well, either way, it's only
temporary.

59
00:06:46,318 --> 00:06:51,585
- It doesn't matter.
Three weeks in there for a
16 year old. Uh uh.

60
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:55,066
Oh, Millie, please file this
before you leave.
- Sure.

61
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:58,113
- And you better get moving,
you have some packing to do. And
remember...

62
00:06:58,287 --> 00:07:00,594
- I know, sun block.

63
00:07:00,768 --> 00:07:03,727
- Yeah, and no more
refrigerator magnets.

64
00:07:03,901 --> 00:07:07,470
Send me a post card
instead. Enjoy your vacation.

65
00:07:07,644 --> 00:07:10,517
- Hello beautiful.

66
00:07:10,691 --> 00:07:12,606
Hey. Hello.

67
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:14,346
- Davis.

68
00:07:14,521 --> 00:07:18,525
- Am I interrupting?
- Yes. But come on in anyway.

69
00:07:18,699 --> 00:07:20,962
What are you doing in my
courthouse?

70
00:07:21,136 --> 00:07:25,619
- Well, just filed a suit
against Med Phase, they screwed
up a routine surgery

71
00:07:25,793 --> 00:07:29,623
on a 19 year old woman. Top
athlete. It is going to cost
them.

72
00:07:29,797 --> 00:07:31,973
- Let me guess, more than
enough to send you and your

73
00:07:32,147 --> 00:07:34,715
latest to Tuscany for the
entire summer.

74
00:07:34,889 --> 00:07:37,587
- Hey, I'm surprised. Tuscany
is unbearable in the summer.

75
00:07:37,761 --> 00:07:41,591
I'm thinking about Tahiti or
Bora Bora.

76
00:07:41,765 --> 00:07:43,593
- How come you and I never made
it to Tahiti?

77
00:07:43,767 --> 00:07:45,552
- Because you were always too
busy with your work.

78
00:07:45,726 --> 00:07:47,597
The law is
a jealous mistress.

79
00:07:47,771 --> 00:07:51,645
- So was your secretary, as I
recall. [LAUGH]

80
00:07:51,819 --> 00:07:54,517
- Are you free Saturday night?
I'm throwing a little party over
at the grill.

81
00:07:54,691 --> 00:07:58,652
- Saturday? Yeah, yeah, I could
probably stop by.

82
00:07:58,826 --> 00:08:00,654
- Good, there's somebody I
want you to meet.

83
00:08:00,828 --> 00:08:02,438
- Heh, [LAUGH]
you're not setting me up are
you?

84
00:08:02,612 --> 00:08:09,489
- No, God, no. I'm getting
married.

85
00:08:09,663 --> 00:08:13,057
- Ah.
- Her name is Monica Tejada.
She is a civil attorney.

86
00:08:13,231 --> 00:08:15,843
She worked her way through
Stanford, two years in justice

87
00:08:16,017 --> 00:08:20,412
and she just got a spot at
Johnston Sloan. I think you'll
like her.

88
00:08:20,587 --> 00:08:23,154
- She sounds young.

89
00:08:23,328 --> 00:08:24,547
- 28.

90
00:08:24,721 --> 00:08:27,550
- Very young.

91
00:08:27,724 --> 00:08:29,987
- All right, I'm sorry, have I
gone about this in the wrong
way?

92
00:08:30,161 --> 00:08:35,645
- No, [STAMMERS] not at all.
Uh, congratulations. I'd love to
come to your party.

93
00:08:35,819 --> 00:08:37,299
- Really?
- Yes.
- [OVERLAPPING] Good.

94
00:08:37,734 --> 00:08:39,519
- Well, great, who knows, you
may even enjoy yourself, huh?

95
00:08:39,693 --> 00:08:44,045
- I, yeah, yeah. Who knows. I,
I don't mean to be rude, Davis,

96
00:08:44,219 --> 00:08:46,787
but I've got a lot of work to
do.

97
00:08:46,961 --> 00:08:48,658
- Can I give you a little piece
of advice?

98
00:08:48,832 --> 00:08:50,486
- Why not?

99
00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:52,836
- Don't send that girl to jail.

100
00:08:53,010 --> 00:08:56,057
I'm sorry, hey, sue me, I
was eavesdropping.

101
00:08:56,231 --> 00:08:58,625
Kids that age are vulnerable.
They're so easily swayed.

102
00:08:58,799 --> 00:09:00,670
- I know the dangers as well as
you do.

103
00:09:00,844 --> 00:09:02,193
But there was no place
else to put her.

104
00:09:02,367 --> 00:09:03,455
It's the system.

105
00:09:03,630 --> 00:09:09,766
- Kay. You are the system.

106
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:13,901
- Davis, I know you mean well,
but, I've got a lot of work
to do.

107
00:09:14,075 --> 00:09:17,078
- Which is exactly why we
never made it to Tahiti.

108
00:09:17,252 --> 00:09:18,514
See you Saturday.

109
00:09:41,058 --> 00:09:45,628
- I see her right over there.
Thank you. I know, I know
[LAUGH] I'm sorry I'm late.

110
00:09:45,802 --> 00:09:50,633
- You look tired. I understand.
The week before recess she had a
million cases.

111
00:09:50,807 --> 00:09:52,243
Do they work you
too hard?

112
00:09:52,417 --> 00:09:54,115
- I'll survive.

113
00:09:54,289 --> 00:09:56,291
- Thank you.

114
00:09:56,465 --> 00:10:00,164
Speaking of recess, what's
your project this year?

115
00:10:00,338 --> 00:10:02,166
- What do you mean?

116
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:04,647
- You always have a project.

117
00:10:04,821 --> 00:10:06,649
- No I don't [LAUGH] .

118
00:10:06,823 --> 00:10:11,828
- Yes you do. Last year you
refinished those old chairs

119
00:10:12,002 --> 00:10:13,613
and the year before that you

120
00:10:13,787 --> 00:10:15,745
stripped your dining room floors
and the year before

121
00:10:15,919 --> 00:10:18,530
that, you had bookshelves made
for the study.

122
00:10:18,705 --> 00:10:20,620
- What is your point mother?

123
00:10:20,794 --> 00:10:24,972
- How about seeing some actual
people?

124
00:10:25,146 --> 00:10:29,324
- You, uh, shouldn't be
referring to you and dad by any
chance would you?

125
00:10:29,498 --> 00:10:33,197
- Kay, this feud you have is
silly.

126
00:10:33,371 --> 00:10:34,851
- It's not a feud mom.

127
00:10:35,025 --> 00:10:36,810
- I don't care what you call
it, it's stupid.

128
00:10:36,984 --> 00:10:38,942
- Are we going to eat or argue?

129
00:10:39,116 --> 00:10:41,815
- Honey, what your father did
was wrong. [STAMMERS]

130
00:10:41,989 --> 00:10:45,340
- Katy, now don't get upset
with your mother, she didn't
know I was coming.

131
00:10:45,514 --> 00:10:48,343
I, I looked at her date book.

132
00:10:48,517 --> 00:10:52,652
- I'm sorry, I didn't know.

133
00:10:52,826 --> 00:10:57,657
- Katy. At least help me
understand.

134
00:10:57,831 --> 00:11:00,747
- [OVERLAPPING] Okay. You don't
understand?

135
00:11:00,921 --> 00:11:04,838
- I asked you for a delay in a
case. Judges do that all the
time.

136
00:11:05,012 --> 00:11:07,667
- Not for their fathers. And
not for some

137
00:11:07,841 --> 00:11:10,974
irrelevant legal matter that
could have gotten us both
disbarred.

138
00:11:11,148 --> 00:11:14,674
- But you haven't heard my
side of the story. At least, let
me explain.

139
00:11:14,848 --> 00:11:16,110
- [OVERLAPPING] I don't want
to [UNINTELLIGIBLE] look, I'll
call you, okay?

140
00:11:16,284 --> 00:11:17,677
- Oh, Kay.

141
00:11:27,077 --> 00:11:31,778
- In regard to Anderson versus
Craig, both parties have agreed
to new terms of custody

142
00:11:31,952 --> 00:11:37,131
and waive hearing on the 14th.
Oh, and Millie, remind me to
follow up with the D. A.

143
00:11:37,305 --> 00:11:42,745
on the Nunez case. We also have
the Peterson matter which...

144
00:11:42,919 --> 00:11:48,751
- [OVERLAPPING] [MAKES NOISE]
I'm sorry your honor, I didn't
mean to startle you.

145
00:11:48,925 --> 00:11:52,363
My name's Miranda, I'm a case
worker with the Child Welfare
office.

146
00:11:52,537 --> 00:11:54,104
- It's late. What do you want?

147
00:11:54,278 --> 00:11:56,716
- I would like to talk to you
about Sally Powell.

148
00:11:56,890 --> 00:11:59,980
- Oh, I see. Now, you want to
talk. Where were you three hours
ago?

149
00:12:00,154 --> 00:12:02,156
- I apologize for that.

150
00:12:02,330 --> 00:12:07,944
- Apologize to Sally. Not me.
She's in jail. Because of you.

151
00:12:08,118 --> 00:12:11,295
- [STAMMERS] It's not entirely
my fault. My department is on
overload right now.

152
00:12:11,469 --> 00:12:14,168
We're understaffed.

153
00:12:14,342 --> 00:12:17,824
- Oh I see, well. Tell me this.
What kind of foster family

154
00:12:17,998 --> 00:12:19,913
rejects a girl just for being
different?

155
00:12:20,087 --> 00:12:22,959
I don't understand that? Where
do you get these families?

156
00:12:23,133 --> 00:12:26,920
- Sally has been through so
much already. She is a bright
kid, full of promise.

157
00:12:27,094 --> 00:12:31,881
- Wow, I, I'm sure she is. But
finding her a home is your
responsibility, not mine.

158
00:12:32,055 --> 00:12:36,756
- If you could just help.

159
00:12:36,930 --> 00:12:40,063
- I'll be happy to take a look
at her file

160
00:12:40,237 --> 00:12:44,372
and assist you in any way I can.
In three weeks.

161
00:13:04,435 --> 00:13:05,785
[doorbell chimes]

162
00:13:15,185 --> 00:13:19,407
- Hi. I, I know it's early but
I wanted to make sure you'd be
home.

163
00:13:19,581 --> 00:13:20,930
- What are you doing here?

164
00:13:21,104 --> 00:13:23,411
- Making one last plea for
Sally.

165
00:13:23,585 --> 00:13:25,979
- Well, I, I've already
explained to you...

166
00:13:26,153 --> 00:13:29,025
- [OVERLAPPING] Your honor, in
all good conscience, how can
either of us complain

167
00:13:29,199 --> 00:13:33,769
about the system if we don't do
everything in our power to
change it.

168
00:13:33,943 --> 00:13:35,771
Just take a look,

169
00:13:36,119 --> 00:13:39,470
get to know Sally a little. If
you see what I see, you'll
realize,

170
00:13:39,644 --> 00:13:42,909
she deserves every break we can
give her.

171
00:13:43,083 --> 00:13:44,824
- Fine.

172
00:13:44,998 --> 00:13:46,956
- Thank you judge. [STAMMERS]
There's just a few pages,

173
00:13:47,130 --> 00:13:50,830
I didn't want to overload you
with the whole case history.

174
00:13:51,004 --> 00:13:53,876
- I, I can't promise you
anything.

175
00:13:54,050 --> 00:13:59,926
- Don't worry [LAUGH] , I have
faith enough for both of us.

176
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:01,231
- Okay.

177
00:14:01,405 --> 00:14:02,232
- Thank you.

178
00:14:02,406 --> 00:14:04,452
-Bye

179
00:15:29,972 --> 00:15:31,800
- Good morning.

180
00:15:31,974 --> 00:15:34,934
- Morning. Well, visiting hours
don't start for another hour.

181
00:15:35,108 --> 00:15:36,587
You can wait over there if you
like.

182
00:15:36,761 --> 00:15:40,113
- I'm Judge Katherine Woodbury.

183
00:15:40,287 --> 00:15:41,897
- Sorry, judge. What can I do
for you?

184
00:15:42,071 --> 00:15:44,421
- I sent a juvenile over
yesterday, temporary custody.

185
00:15:44,595 --> 00:15:45,553
- Name?

186
00:15:45,727 --> 00:15:50,558
- Powell, Sally Ann.

187
00:15:50,732 --> 00:15:54,344
- 43 unit 221 but she's
probably out in the yard now.

188
00:15:54,518 --> 00:15:55,998
- Can you take me?

189
00:15:56,172 --> 00:15:57,869
- You want to go back there?

190
00:15:58,044 --> 00:15:59,393
- Yes, I do.

191
00:15:59,567 --> 00:16:01,656
- I don't think that's such
a good idea.

192
00:16:01,830 --> 00:16:04,485
- I, I would like to see
the prison yard, sergeant. Is
that a problem?

193
00:16:04,659 --> 00:16:07,749
- No ma'am. Your honor, no
problem at all.

194
00:16:22,633 --> 00:16:26,202
- I would think a stroll in
this place would be an effective
deterrent.

195
00:16:26,376 --> 00:16:28,291
- Worked for my
son. He was acting up so

196
00:16:28,465 --> 00:16:30,250
I brought him down here
for the night shift.

197
00:16:30,424 --> 00:16:34,602
And now it's straight As, every
semester.

198
00:16:34,776 --> 00:16:36,343
The yard's just out
here.

199
00:16:36,517 --> 00:16:39,433
Holly will take you out. Looking
for Powell, Sally Ann.

200
00:16:39,607 --> 00:16:41,130
- Thank you.

201
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:44,960
-[background chatter] I haven't 
seen her, maybe she's inside.

202
00:16:45,134 --> 00:16:47,615
I didn't ask you. [ALL TALKING AT ONCE]

203
00:16:57,668 --> 00:16:59,279
- She's over there.

204
00:16:59,453 --> 00:17:02,151
- I won. [ALL TALKING AT ONCE]

205
00:17:05,372 --> 00:17:07,852
- Thank you. [ALL TALKING AT
ONCE]

206
00:17:23,694 --> 00:17:26,610
- I give up, what are you
looking at?

207
00:17:26,784 --> 00:17:31,311
- Good question. What's the
book?

208
00:17:31,485 --> 00:17:34,140
- It's how to escape from
prison manual.

209
00:17:34,314 --> 00:17:39,710
- Good sense of humor. [LAUGH]
It's important, it'll see you
through a lot in life.

210
00:17:39,884 --> 00:17:42,583
- Sure done wonders for me so
far.

211
00:17:48,850 --> 00:17:52,071
- Nice talking to you.

212
00:17:52,245 --> 00:17:54,725
- Come on come on. [ALL TALKING AT ONCE]

213
00:18:25,495 --> 00:18:28,194
- [remembers Davis] Don't send
the girl to jail.

214
00:18:32,241 --> 00:18:33,373
- [remembers Miranda] Sally has
been through so much already.

215
00:18:33,547 --> 00:18:36,071
She is a bright kid, full of
promise.

216
00:18:48,823 --> 00:18:50,259
- Forget something, judge?

217
00:18:50,433 --> 00:18:52,696
- Hey, you got a form 209A back
there somewhere?

218
00:18:52,870 --> 00:18:55,221
- Yes, ma'am I think so.

219
00:18:55,395 --> 00:18:57,962
- Get your California codes.

220
00:19:04,447 --> 00:19:06,057
- Ma'am.

221
00:19:06,232 --> 00:19:11,193
- Please read, welfare and
institution, section 385.

222
00:19:11,367 --> 00:19:14,240
- Any order by the court may at
any time be modified or set

223
00:19:14,414 --> 00:19:16,720
aside as the presiding judge
deems proper.

224
00:19:16,894 --> 00:19:20,463
- Now read section 319.

225
00:19:20,637 --> 00:19:22,291
- The court may order
the child to be placed in

226
00:19:22,465 --> 00:19:24,163
the approved home of
a non relative for a

227
00:19:24,337 --> 00:19:28,863
period not to exceed
30 juridical days.

228
00:19:29,037 --> 00:19:32,780
- Sign at the bottom and would
you please witness.

229
00:19:38,655 --> 00:19:43,269
- Court's releasing Sally Ann
Powell to the custody of
Katherine A. Woodbury?

230
00:19:43,443 --> 00:19:44,966
- Yes.

231
00:20:01,025 --> 00:20:03,332
- It's a big house. You'll
have your own room and bath.

232
00:20:03,506 --> 00:20:06,379
And I expect you to keep them
both clean.

233
00:20:06,553 --> 00:20:09,338
You can come and go as you
please, but there is a curfew.

234
00:20:09,512 --> 00:20:13,255
10:00 on weekdays and 11:00 on
weekends.

235
00:20:13,429 --> 00:20:15,301
I think that's reasonable.

236
00:20:32,492 --> 00:20:38,628
- Come in.

237
00:20:38,802 --> 00:20:41,152
- Do you own this?

238
00:20:41,327 --> 00:20:43,285
- Yes.

239
00:20:43,459 --> 00:20:45,635
- And you live here all by
yourself?

240
00:20:45,809 --> 00:20:48,769
- Uh huh.

241
00:20:48,943 --> 00:20:54,165
- You're right, it's big.

242
00:20:54,340 --> 00:20:55,689
Don't you get scared?

243
00:20:55,863 --> 00:20:57,778
- Sometimes.

244
00:20:57,952 --> 00:21:00,084
- But you have a security
system, right?

245
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:05,176
- Uh, absolutely and there's
no reason for either of us
to be nervous.

246
00:21:05,351 --> 00:21:07,266
- I'm not nervous.

247
00:21:11,095 --> 00:21:12,445
- Here, let me help you.

248
00:21:12,619 --> 00:21:14,185
- I'll do that.

249
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:18,494
- Fine.

250
00:21:18,668 --> 00:21:23,325
Uh, the closet's here.
And you have plenty of room in
the chest of drawers.

251
00:21:23,499 --> 00:21:24,544
Your own TV.

252
00:21:24,718 --> 00:21:26,807
- How many channels you got?

253
00:21:26,981 --> 00:21:28,852
- 150 at last count.

254
00:21:29,026 --> 00:21:31,942
Go ahead and unpack and
I'll go rustle up some lunch.

255
00:21:32,116 --> 00:21:33,944
Come to the kitchen when
you're ready.

256
00:21:39,385 --> 00:21:41,952
- You're in, what, ninth grade?

257
00:21:42,126 --> 00:21:43,911
- Tenth.

258
00:21:51,788 --> 00:21:56,402
- Well I guess there's no
point in going to school. It's
after 1:00.

259
00:21:56,576 --> 00:21:58,665
- I'm always up for a day off.

260
00:21:58,839 --> 00:22:00,754
- Yeah.

261
00:22:04,627 --> 00:22:09,502
- So, what's this court
recess?

262
00:22:09,676 --> 00:22:16,770
- Well, we close down for three
weeks every year to catch up on
appeals and petitions.

263
00:22:16,944 --> 00:22:21,427
- I get it. You baby-sit me for
a while and then drop me off

264
00:22:21,601 --> 00:22:25,387
somewhere on your way back to
work. Right?

265
00:22:25,561 --> 00:22:29,522
- Here's the deal. There was
no place to put you but jail or
my house.

266
00:22:29,696 --> 00:22:35,005
So, you'll stay with me
until we can find you
another foster family.

267
00:22:35,179 --> 00:22:39,532
- I know what's going
to happen. I'm a four
time loser already.

268
00:22:39,706 --> 00:22:41,969
- I'm not saying it's going
to be easy.

269
00:22:42,143 --> 00:22:43,492
- Then why bother?

270
00:22:43,666 --> 00:22:45,494
- Because it beats the
alternative.

271
00:22:45,668 --> 00:22:47,670
- In your opinion.

272
00:22:47,844 --> 00:22:53,546
- Boy you are sure not
out to win any popularity
contests are you?

273
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:56,375
- I think I'll go keep my room
clean.

274
00:23:08,517 --> 00:23:11,607
- I have a few errands to run.
You want to come along?

275
00:23:11,781 --> 00:23:14,349
- I don't think so.

276
00:23:14,523 --> 00:23:17,091
- Can I trust you here alone?

277
00:23:17,265 --> 00:23:21,400
- I don't know. Can you?

278
00:23:21,574 --> 00:23:24,664
- If that's the way it's going
to be, fine.

279
00:23:24,838 --> 00:23:30,452
But for someone who stole a car
last week, you might want to
briefly consider the entire

280
00:23:30,626 --> 00:23:33,760
range of consequences that a
judge can bring down on your
underage head.

281
00:23:33,934 --> 00:23:41,507
- Fine, I won't run off.
Besides, where would I go?

282
00:23:41,681 --> 00:23:43,900
- Fine, I'll see you later this
evening.

283
00:23:50,690 --> 00:23:53,432
Miranda. I was just coming to
see you.

284
00:23:53,606 --> 00:23:55,521
- Yeah, I just found out what
you did for Sally.

285
00:23:55,695 --> 00:23:58,611
Thank you so much. I really
appreciate it.

286
00:23:58,785 --> 00:24:01,701
- Well, I'm going to need more
than appreciation to get
thorough this one.

287
00:24:01,875 --> 00:24:04,747
- Yeah. [LAUGH] Parenting isn't
easy.

288
00:24:04,921 --> 00:24:08,751
- Well, I'm hardly her parent,
but, uh, if I'm going to battle,

289
00:24:08,925 --> 00:24:11,493
I better be armed so, get me
everything you've got on her.

290
00:24:11,667 --> 00:24:14,409
- Okay, I'm, I'm on a break so
why don't we grab a cup of
coffee.

291
00:24:52,273 --> 00:24:56,016
- Look mom . How beautiful.

292
00:25:26,612 --> 00:25:32,574
Hey, it's Sally. Is Pete around?
No, no message.

293
00:25:32,748 --> 00:25:36,186
I'll call him back, thanks.
Wait.

294
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:40,539
Yeah, hi, just, um, when you
tell him I called,

295
00:25:40,713 --> 00:25:43,759
will you let him know I'm out.
He'll understand.

296
00:25:43,933 --> 00:25:45,152
Thanks.

297
00:25:51,854 --> 00:25:55,597
- Four families in five years.
That can't be normal.

298
00:25:55,771 --> 00:25:58,818
- It's not. A lot of foster
children stick with one family.

299
00:25:58,992 --> 00:26:01,560
They connect with a parent or a
sibling but

300
00:26:01,734 --> 00:26:03,953
Sally never has. Thank you.

301
00:26:04,127 --> 00:26:07,957
- Well, what about when she was
younger? Didn't anyone want to
adopt her?

302
00:26:08,131 --> 00:26:11,570
- Yeah, she came close when she
was three, but the couple
stopped the proceedings when the

303
00:26:11,744 --> 00:26:14,573
wife got pregnant. A few years
later another couple was

304
00:26:14,747 --> 00:26:16,487
interested, but then
they split up.

305
00:26:16,662 --> 00:26:18,228
- Oh, what rotten luck.

306
00:26:18,402 --> 00:26:20,709
- Exactly. The second time
Sally was old enough to

307
00:26:20,883 --> 00:26:23,712
understand what was happening.
And she took it pretty hard.

308
00:26:23,886 --> 00:26:25,671
That's when she started to
shut down.

309
00:26:25,845 --> 00:26:31,590
- No wonder she's so tough.

310
00:26:31,764 --> 00:26:35,594
Don't you have anything
that isn't a, a report
or an evaluation?

311
00:26:35,768 --> 00:26:38,771
What about a paper
she wrote for school?

312
00:26:38,945 --> 00:26:42,252
- No, that's it except for
sealed records and I don't
have access to them.

313
00:26:42,426 --> 00:26:44,603
- I do.

314
00:26:44,777 --> 00:26:46,605
- Nobody's done this much for
Sally.

315
00:26:46,779 --> 00:26:49,129
- Well, right now, I'm her
legal guardian.

316
00:27:04,666 --> 00:27:06,233
- Still here.

317
00:27:06,407 --> 00:27:09,976
- So I see. You're a reader.

318
00:27:10,150 --> 00:27:12,500
- It's an escape.

319
00:27:12,674 --> 00:27:18,332
- Yeah, I know what you
mean. When I was your age I was
never without a book.

320
00:27:18,506 --> 00:27:24,164
What is it, uh,
David Copperfield. One of
my favorites.

321
00:27:24,338 --> 00:27:26,645
- Yeah, me too.

322
00:27:30,953 --> 00:27:33,042
Well, I have
school tomorrow, I
should go to bed.

323
00:27:33,216 --> 00:27:34,043
- Good idea.

324
00:27:34,217 --> 00:27:35,175
- Good night, judge.

325
00:27:35,349 --> 00:27:39,005
- Please call me Kay.

326
00:27:39,179 --> 00:27:40,702
- All right. Kay.

327
00:27:40,876 --> 00:27:48,188
- Sleep well. Sally. I'm glad
you're here.

328
00:28:04,334 --> 00:28:10,340
-[Sally] I know, I know, I
know.

329
00:28:10,514 --> 00:28:12,299
I didn't want any help.

330
00:28:12,473 --> 00:28:18,348
I can do it myself. I'm doing
fine. So get out and beat it.

331
00:28:18,522 --> 00:28:21,874
- Sally.
- [OVERLAPPING] Please don't
go, come back. Please. No.

332
00:28:22,048 --> 00:28:23,136
- [OVERLAPPING] Sally.
- Mom. [MAKES NOISE] Mom.

333
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:24,398
- What is it, what is it,
what's wrong.

334
00:28:24,572 --> 00:28:26,879
- [MAKES NOISE] Mom, pleases.

335
00:28:27,053 --> 00:28:30,012
- Wake up, it's a nightmare.
Sally, it's okay, it's okay.

336
00:28:30,186 --> 00:28:33,799
[MAKES NOISE] It's just a
nightmare. Sally, wake up.

337
00:28:44,113 --> 00:28:48,291
- This isn't really my field.
I don't see many kids in my
practice

338
00:28:48,465 --> 00:28:52,252
and, uh, without a clinical
evaluation, it's tough to say.

339
00:28:52,426 --> 00:28:54,907
- Well it must be something
there.

340
00:28:55,081 --> 00:28:57,910
- No evidence of serious
illness, I can tell you that.

341
00:28:58,084 --> 00:29:00,303
- What about the nightmares?

342
00:29:00,477 --> 00:29:03,132
- Well, she's got to have
someone to talk to. Kids have
vivid imaginations.

343
00:29:03,306 --> 00:29:08,964
And this one's hurt because she
was abandoned. The clothes, the
attitude,

344
00:29:09,138 --> 00:29:12,881
the nightmares, she's acting
out because she's all alone
in the world.

345
00:29:13,055 --> 00:29:15,188
- She's smart, Michael.

346
00:29:15,362 --> 00:29:19,105
- The test scores certainly
indicate that. And so does the
behavior.

347
00:29:19,279 --> 00:29:21,716
Bright kids tend to over reach
when they're up against a wall.

348
00:29:21,890 --> 00:29:24,023
- Why?

349
00:29:24,197 --> 00:29:28,854
- Because I think they know
that they're missing
something important.

350
00:29:29,028 --> 00:29:32,683
If you like, I could set up an
evaluation, that might be
better.

351
00:29:32,858 --> 00:29:34,729
- Thanks. I'll think about it.

352
00:29:34,903 --> 00:29:36,687
- Morning.

353
00:29:36,862 --> 00:29:40,343
- Good morning. Sally, this is
Dr. Katsu. He lives next door.

354
00:29:40,517 --> 00:29:42,476
- Hi Sally.

355
00:29:42,650 --> 00:29:45,827
- I was just telling him
that you'd be staying here
for a while.

356
00:29:46,001 --> 00:29:47,960
The Katsu's have a son, Danny,
about your age.

357
00:29:48,134 --> 00:29:49,962
- We'll have to get you two
together.

358
00:29:50,136 --> 00:29:51,920
- What kid of doctor are you?

359
00:29:52,094 --> 00:29:53,226
- I'm a psychiatrist.

360
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:56,316
- So anything do we ever
committed?

361
00:29:56,490 --> 00:30:01,756
- [LAUGH] Very funny. We need
to get you some breakfast.
Thanks for the advice.

362
00:30:01,930 --> 00:30:03,802
- Not a problem.

363
00:30:08,110 --> 00:30:11,897
- In your office there's some
pictures of you with some old
people.

364
00:30:12,071 --> 00:30:13,246
Are they your parents? [LAUGH]

365
00:30:13,637 --> 00:30:17,424
- Old people? Whoa. My mother
would love that.

366
00:30:17,598 --> 00:30:19,861
- So your mom's alive?

367
00:30:20,035 --> 00:30:23,734
- Alive and kicking. My father,
too.

368
00:30:23,909 --> 00:30:25,345
- Do they live nearby?

369
00:30:25,519 --> 00:30:27,913
- About 45 minutes away.

370
00:30:28,087 --> 00:30:35,094
- What's that like? Having
parents?

371
00:30:35,268 --> 00:30:41,535
- Uh, well, it's, it's
wonderful and it's difficult

372
00:30:41,709 --> 00:30:43,885
and it's very, very complicated.

373
00:30:44,059 --> 00:30:46,192
- What do you mean?

374
00:30:46,366 --> 00:30:48,847
- It means I love my mother and
father very much,

375
00:30:49,021 --> 00:30:52,415
but sometimes it's hard to be
around them.

376
00:30:52,589 --> 00:30:53,982
- Do they love you?

377
00:30:54,156 --> 00:30:56,028
- Too much, I think.

378
00:30:56,202 --> 00:30:58,421
- How can someone love you too
much?

379
00:30:58,595 --> 00:31:01,424
- Trust me, it happens.

380
00:31:01,598 --> 00:31:06,865
- No one's ever loved me.

381
00:31:07,039 --> 00:31:09,824
- I bet you're wrong, I bet
plenty of people love you.

382
00:31:09,998 --> 00:31:11,957
- Well no one's ever said it to
me.

383
00:31:12,131 --> 00:31:14,394
- Well, maybe they're afraid to
say it.

384
00:31:14,568 --> 00:31:17,005
- Whatever. Doesn't really
matter. I don't care.

385
00:31:25,144 --> 00:31:30,279
- [School yard chatter]

386
00:31:30,453 --> 00:31:36,851
- Sally. Do you remember
[STAMMERS] anything about last
night?

387
00:31:37,025 --> 00:31:39,810
It was very late and I heard
voices coming from your room.

388
00:31:39,985 --> 00:31:41,943
So, I went to check on you.

389
00:31:42,117 --> 00:31:43,031
- I'm going to be late for
English period.

390
00:31:43,205 --> 00:31:44,903
- You were talking to someone.

391
00:31:45,077 --> 00:31:48,167
- Big deal, I was sleeping, it
was a nightmare.

392
00:31:48,341 --> 00:31:54,347
- No, it wasn't like that. It
was, it was more like you were
in a trance of some kind.

393
00:31:54,521 --> 00:32:01,006
- I was in a trance. And I was
talking to someone. Who was I
talking to?

394
00:32:01,180 --> 00:32:03,138
- Your mother.

395
00:32:03,312 --> 00:32:06,098
- I don't have a mother.

396
00:32:06,272 --> 00:32:09,101
- You were pleading with her,
she wanted you to do something.

397
00:32:09,275 --> 00:32:11,059
- And why would I want to do
something for my mother?

398
00:32:11,233 --> 00:32:13,366
Huh, why would I even want to
talk to my mother, Kay?

399
00:32:13,540 --> 00:32:16,891
- Sally, please.
- No, she abandoned me. She
dumped me like I was garbage.

400
00:32:17,065 --> 00:32:19,633
- Sally, just, okay, let me
just talk to you a minute.

401
00:32:26,292 --> 00:32:33,212
- Wake up people. Who can tell
me what's really going on
here? Nobody eat breakfast?

402
00:32:33,386 --> 00:32:37,390
Come on you guys. If all George
and Martha ever wanted was to
have a child, how could

403
00:32:37,564 --> 00:32:42,221
George just kill their son off?
What is the playwright trying to
say here?

404
00:32:42,395 --> 00:32:45,311
Did anyone read the play?

405
00:32:45,485 --> 00:32:49,054
- Did, uh, George and Martha
need marriage counseling?
[LAUGH]

406
00:32:49,228 --> 00:32:52,971
- Sally. Help me out here.

407
00:32:53,145 --> 00:32:56,017
- Couldn't have children.
- Sorry.

408
00:32:56,191 --> 00:32:58,628
- They couldn't have a family.
So they made one up.

409
00:32:58,802 --> 00:33:02,328
- Good, that's right. Don't
forget everybody,

410
00:33:02,502 --> 00:33:04,591
there's an essay due on
Thursday which you have to

411
00:33:04,765 --> 00:33:09,944
read the play in order to write
it. Enjoy your lunch.

412
00:33:21,695 --> 00:33:23,914
- So you want to cut class?

413
00:33:24,089 --> 00:33:26,961
- Nah.

414
00:33:27,135 --> 00:33:29,137
- Then again the mind's a
terrible thing to waste.

415
00:33:29,311 --> 00:33:31,270
- That's what I hear. What are
you doing here?

416
00:33:31,444 --> 00:33:34,099
- Looking for you. Where'd they
dump you this time?

417
00:33:34,273 --> 00:33:36,144
- You wouldn't believe me if
I told you.

418
00:33:36,318 --> 00:33:40,192
- Who cares. You're out of
jail.

419
00:33:40,366 --> 00:33:42,716
- And I have some good news. I
got us some money.

420
00:33:42,890 --> 00:33:45,458
- What do you mean?

421
00:33:45,632 --> 00:33:48,026
- Getting out of here, going to
San Francisco like we talked
about. Now we can afford it.

422
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:49,070
- How much you get?

423
00:33:49,244 --> 00:33:50,637
- You'll see.

424
00:33:50,811 --> 00:33:52,465
- Come on, [SOUNDS LIKE] Sal,
how much?

425
00:33:52,639 --> 00:33:55,946
- I'll tell you after School.
It's going to be great.

426
00:33:56,121 --> 00:33:58,166
- Right.

427
00:33:58,340 --> 00:34:03,998
♪♪♪

428
00:35:50,844 --> 00:35:52,759
Can I help you?

429
00:35:52,933 --> 00:35:55,936
- Yes you can. I have something
to sell.

430
00:36:01,898 --> 00:36:03,726
These wouldn't
be stolen would they?

431
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:07,077
- My grandmother gave them to
me.

432
00:36:07,252 --> 00:36:08,644
- All right, if you say so.

433
00:36:12,822 --> 00:36:18,132
- James Powell and his wife had
a little girl. And they moved
into a house in Solvang.

434
00:36:18,306 --> 00:36:21,701
He was studying architecture and
she wanted to be a school
teacher.

435
00:36:21,875 --> 00:36:26,358
When Sally was nine months old
they were walking along Pacific
Coast Highway.

436
00:36:26,532 --> 00:36:32,494
A drunk driver jumped the curb.
James's back was broken in three
places.

437
00:36:32,668 --> 00:36:36,716
His wife was killed. She was no
older than you.

438
00:36:36,890 --> 00:36:38,108
- You're 18?

439
00:36:38,283 --> 00:36:40,763
I am.

440
00:36:40,937 --> 00:36:43,723
I'll say, uh, 200 bucks.

441
00:36:43,897 --> 00:36:49,207
-[Kay] James tried to raise
Sally for over a year by himself
with a broken back.

442
00:36:49,381 --> 00:36:54,299
But this letter in the file, to
whom it may concern.

443
00:36:54,473 --> 00:36:58,738
I cannot give Sally what she
deserves and I want her to have
the best life possible.

444
00:36:58,912 --> 00:37:02,220
Maybe we'll meet again when she
is mature enough to forgive an
old man

445
00:37:02,394 --> 00:37:07,268
for not measuring up when he was
young. Until then, make sure
she knows

446
00:37:07,442 --> 00:37:14,144
how much her dad loves
her. Sincerely, James T.
Powell, Junior.

447
00:37:14,319 --> 00:37:16,843
- Poor man.

448
00:37:17,017 --> 00:37:21,500
- Do you have any idea how
important it would be for Sally
to know that her dad cares?

449
00:37:21,674 --> 00:37:24,894
- Every child needs to know
that.

450
00:37:25,068 --> 00:37:28,420
- 200 bucks.

451
00:37:28,594 --> 00:37:30,770
- I couldn't come up
with anything, on
her mother, her,

452
00:37:30,944 --> 00:37:36,950
her name appears on the birth
certificate but I, I can't
read it.

453
00:37:37,124 --> 00:37:40,475
- Is it Margaret or Marjorie.

454
00:37:40,649 --> 00:37:45,785
- No telling and it's the only
place her name appears. It's
not on any of the other forms.

455
00:37:45,959 --> 00:37:49,789
- Well, that's because she was
already dead when the foster
home proceedings began.

456
00:37:49,963 --> 00:37:56,883
Here's a cemetery plot. Uh, Mr.
and Mrs. James T. Powell,
Junior, Rose Hills Cemetery.

457
00:37:57,057 --> 00:37:59,799
It's right here in San Diego.
Bet you'd find the mother there.

458
00:37:59,973 --> 00:38:02,802
- Oh, it's the dad
who I'm interested in.

459
00:38:02,976 --> 00:38:05,413
- You think he's still around?

460
00:38:05,587 --> 00:38:08,808
- I've already checked the
phone book and gone online but
there's no local listing.

461
00:38:08,982 --> 00:38:11,550
Next stops the county clerk.
I'm going to look for a
business license.

462
00:38:11,724 --> 00:38:13,987
Maybe he opened shop as an
architect.

463
00:38:14,161 --> 00:38:17,860
- Maybe James Powell doesn't
want to be reunited with
his daughter.

464
00:38:18,034 --> 00:38:19,558
You ever think about that?

465
00:38:19,732 --> 00:38:23,388
- They're family. They belong
together.

466
00:38:26,391 --> 00:38:27,870
- 200 bucks is not nearly
enough.

467
00:38:28,044 --> 00:38:31,004
- No it's not.

468
00:38:39,447 --> 00:38:43,756
Just take a little more, she's
rich, she won't even miss it.

469
00:38:43,930 --> 00:38:47,586
This is our chance to get out.
No more foster homes, no more
people taking us in so

470
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:50,502
they can get another government
check.

471
00:38:50,676 --> 00:38:52,852
Come on, Sal, it's the only way
we'll get out of here.

472
00:39:13,089 --> 00:39:20,270
- Powell, Powell, Powell. Here
we go. What'd you say his first
name was?

473
00:39:20,445 --> 00:39:21,446
- James.

474
00:39:21,620 --> 00:39:23,839
- James T. Junior?

475
00:39:24,013 --> 00:39:25,493
- Yes.

476
00:39:37,810 --> 00:39:41,379
- So what's the story on this,
just wait till later?

477
00:39:41,553 --> 00:39:43,119
- Don't push me, okay?

478
00:39:43,293 --> 00:39:45,818
- Sure, whenever you're ready.
But sooner's better.

479
00:40:05,968 --> 00:40:08,971
- You Sally?

480
00:40:09,145 --> 00:40:09,842
- Yeah, who are you?

481
00:40:10,016 --> 00:40:12,018
- Danny Katsu.

482
00:40:12,192 --> 00:40:13,541
- The shrink's kid?

483
00:40:13,715 --> 00:40:15,587
- Yeah. [LAUGH] My dad told me
about you.

484
00:40:15,761 --> 00:40:18,503
- Yeah, I'll bet. You go to Sun
Briar?

485
00:40:18,677 --> 00:40:19,939
- Uh huh.

486
00:40:20,113 --> 00:40:21,723
- How come I've never seen you
there?

487
00:40:21,897 --> 00:40:25,945
- Something tells me we run in
different crowds. [LAUGH]

488
00:40:26,119 --> 00:40:29,427
- So, what do you do for fun?

489
00:40:29,601 --> 00:40:32,125
- I got a chess set in the
backyard.

490
00:40:32,299 --> 00:40:35,128
- Do the cops know? [LAUGH]

491
00:41:13,732 --> 00:41:16,691
- [overheard] Those'll grow good 
in your backyard. I think so, 
yeah.

492
00:41:16,865 --> 00:41:22,175
Uh huh, yeah, so, um, I don't 
know I thought just different 
colors. Yellow instead of...

493
00:41:22,349 --> 00:41:25,787
Yeah. 
You do such a good job.

494
00:41:25,961 --> 00:41:32,185
- That's a black Australian
tree fern. Pulled it off the
truck this morning.

495
00:41:32,359 --> 00:41:37,103
- Oh, I don't need anything
really. I was just looking.

496
00:41:37,277 --> 00:41:40,019
- Well, if you have any
questions, just let me know,
bye.

497
00:41:40,193 --> 00:41:44,806
- Actually, I do have a
questions. I need some work done
at my house, some landscaping.

498
00:41:44,980 --> 00:41:47,113
Could you help me with that?
- Absolutely.

499
00:41:47,287 --> 00:41:49,376
Why don't you step into
my office and tell me about
your property.

500
00:41:54,076 --> 00:41:56,078
Excuse the mess.

501
00:41:56,252 --> 00:41:57,123
- That's okay.
- I've only been meaning to
clean it up for

502
00:41:57,297 --> 00:41:59,778
about ten years now. [LAUGH]

503
00:41:59,952 --> 00:42:01,693
I'm Jim, I'm sorry, what's
your name?

504
00:42:01,867 --> 00:42:03,782
- Woodbury, Katherine Woodbury.

505
00:42:03,956 --> 00:42:05,087
- Why does that sound familiar?

506
00:42:05,261 --> 00:42:06,785
- I'm a judge.

507
00:42:06,959 --> 00:42:08,134
- That's right, you're
tough.

508
00:42:08,308 --> 00:42:09,744
- Only on the bad guys.

509
00:42:09,918 --> 00:42:12,573
- Well, I'll make sure I watch
my step.

510
00:42:12,747 --> 00:42:16,011
Okay so, um, what kind of place
you have judge?

511
00:42:16,185 --> 00:42:21,060
- Kay, please. I have a Spanish
style home in Coronado.

512
00:42:21,234 --> 00:42:24,585
- Well, it's beautiful there.
I, I do a lot of work in that
area.

513
00:42:24,759 --> 00:42:29,503
- I thought maybe I could add
some boxwoods along my property
line.

514
00:42:29,677 --> 00:42:32,071
- Boxwoods are great. They grow
kind of thick.

515
00:42:32,245 --> 00:42:34,769
You'd be walling yourself off
from the rest of the world if
that's what you want.

516
00:42:34,943 --> 00:42:37,076
- Maybe not.

517
00:42:37,250 --> 00:42:38,381
- Well, let's see if I got some
to show you.

518
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:47,869
- Checkmate.

519
00:42:48,043 --> 00:42:52,570
- Hey, you're pretty good.
Don't take this the wrong way,

520
00:42:52,744 --> 00:42:53,788
but most girls don't really get
chess. [LAUGH]

521
00:42:53,962 --> 00:42:56,138
- What's that supposed to mean?

522
00:42:56,312 --> 00:42:58,271
- It's not the most feminine
game. I mean,

523
00:42:58,445 --> 00:43:02,101
seems to be more compelling for
guys who like to smoke pipes.

524
00:43:02,275 --> 00:43:05,626
- One of my foster parents
taught me. And for your
information,

525
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:07,889
I prefer generic cigarettes to a
pipe. [LAUGH]

526
00:43:08,063 --> 00:43:14,853
- How was that, living in a
foster home?

527
00:43:15,027 --> 00:43:22,643
- It's actually okay. Once you
get used to it.

528
00:43:22,817 --> 00:43:27,866
Though you never do get
comfortable. Never know when
it's going to be time to leave.

529
00:43:28,040 --> 00:43:32,784
- It must be hard.

530
00:43:32,958 --> 00:43:37,789
- Yeah, I guess, but you get
by, you know.

531
00:43:37,963 --> 00:43:41,749
Sit here and dwell on how
difficult my life is.

532
00:43:41,923 --> 00:43:46,624
But it won't really make any
difference so, you know, you
just go with it.

533
00:43:50,279 --> 00:43:54,283
So, are you up for another game
or are you tired of losing to a
girl? [LAUGH]

534
00:43:54,457 --> 00:44:00,594
- Bring it on. You are
going down. [LAUGH]

535
00:44:06,948 --> 00:44:10,909
- I'll call you in a day or
two. I just need a little time
to picture all the changes.

536
00:44:11,083 --> 00:44:12,998
- No problem, you take your
time.

537
00:44:13,172 --> 00:44:15,870
- Thank you for your help. I
like your ideas very much.

538
00:44:16,044 --> 00:44:18,220
- Okay, see you later.

539
00:44:18,394 --> 00:44:20,266
- You bet ya.

540
00:44:36,935 --> 00:44:39,502
- There's something you need
to see.

541
00:44:43,942 --> 00:44:46,335
They played four games.
She's won three.

542
00:44:46,509 --> 00:44:48,381
- Ah.

543
00:44:48,555 --> 00:44:52,124
- Danny's the president of the
chess club and she beat him.

544
00:45:13,841 --> 00:45:15,800
- Morning.

545
00:45:15,974 --> 00:45:19,194
- Good morning. You stayed
awfully late at the Katsu's last
night.

546
00:45:19,368 --> 00:45:22,284
- Danny said I couldn't leave
until he beat me two games
in a row.

547
00:45:22,458 --> 00:45:25,984
I finally had to let him win.

548
00:45:26,158 --> 00:45:28,987
- How would you like to be my
date to a party tonight?

549
00:45:29,161 --> 00:45:30,423
- What kind of party?

550
00:45:30,597 --> 00:45:32,904
- It's a nice one. You'll
need a new dress.

551
00:45:33,078 --> 00:45:34,862
- I don't have any dresses.

552
00:45:35,036 --> 00:45:37,691
- That's okay, we'll go
shopping.
- Well.

553
00:45:37,865 --> 00:45:39,824
- Is this what you're looking
for?

554
00:45:39,998 --> 00:45:42,565
- You went through my stuff?

555
00:45:42,740 --> 00:45:48,093
- It was sticking out, staring
at me. I don't know under what
circumstances that came off

556
00:45:48,267 --> 00:45:50,791
but you can probably imagine how
I might feel about that sort
of thing.

557
00:45:50,965 --> 00:45:53,272
- And I bet you're going to
tell me, aren't you?

558
00:45:53,446 --> 00:45:55,317
- It's your body, Sally, you're
a big girl and I'm not your
mother.

559
00:45:55,491 --> 00:45:56,884
[doorbell chimes]

560
00:45:57,058 --> 00:45:58,843
All actions have consequences.
You know?

561
00:45:59,017 --> 00:46:01,193
- Yeah, I get it, okay?

562
00:46:07,939 --> 00:46:09,375
- Oh my...

563
00:46:09,549 --> 00:46:12,160
- What?
- It's nothing, it's nobody.

564
00:46:12,334 --> 00:46:18,863
- Nobody rang the bell. You're
so nervous. Wouldn't be a guy
by any chance would it?

565
00:46:19,037 --> 00:46:21,779
- Yeah, as a matter of fact.

566
00:46:24,912 --> 00:46:26,435
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

567
00:46:26,609 --> 00:46:29,047
- Uh, I know it's early but I
thought I'd come by

568
00:46:29,221 --> 00:46:32,920
and take a look at your
backyard and try and come
up with some ideas.

569
00:46:33,094 --> 00:46:36,924
- Sure, no problem, come on in.

570
00:46:37,098 --> 00:46:39,797
- Thank you.

571
00:46:42,538 --> 00:46:46,412
- Sally, this is Jim. He's
going to be doing some
landscaping work for me.

572
00:46:46,586 --> 00:46:49,023
- Sally. I've always loved that
name.

573
00:46:49,197 --> 00:46:50,372
- Hi.

574
00:46:50,546 --> 00:46:51,765
- Nice to meet you.

575
00:46:51,939 --> 00:46:54,420
- Nice to meet you, too. I
guess.

576
00:46:54,594 --> 00:46:55,900
- So how many children do you
have?

577
00:46:56,161 --> 00:46:59,512
- Sally's not my daughter.
She's a friend.

578
00:46:59,686 --> 00:47:02,080
- Kay doesn't have any
children. She's single.

579
00:47:02,254 --> 00:47:05,300
- Divorced, actually.

580
00:47:05,474 --> 00:47:08,260
- Um, I'm just going to be out
back taking some measurements if
that's okay.

581
00:47:08,434 --> 00:47:13,047
- Oh, sure, take as long as
you'd like. Uh, Sally and I were
just [LAUGH] going shopping.

582
00:47:13,221 --> 00:47:15,920
- You guys have a good time.

583
00:47:20,402 --> 00:47:22,752
- Kay has a boyfriend.

584
00:47:22,927 --> 00:47:24,624
- Shut up, I do not.

585
00:47:39,552 --> 00:47:42,772
Ah, what do you think?

586
00:47:42,947 --> 00:47:44,383
What do you think?

587
00:47:44,557 --> 00:47:47,168
- Ew.
- What?

588
00:47:47,342 --> 00:47:52,391
- Come on Kay, I'm only 16.
I'm not ready to look like you
yet.

589
00:47:52,565 --> 00:47:55,394
Let's go over there.

590
00:47:55,568 --> 00:47:58,005
So, what do you think?

591
00:47:58,179 --> 00:48:00,573
- Uh, it's a party, Sally, not
a rock concert.

592
00:48:13,455 --> 00:48:15,893
- Go ahead, try it on.

593
00:48:16,067 --> 00:48:17,938
- Oh, no thank you, I don't
think it's me.

594
00:48:18,199 --> 00:48:22,856
- It's an original Meldoney.
My boyfriend gave me one
for Christmas.

595
00:48:23,030 --> 00:48:29,994
- Okay.

596
00:48:30,168 --> 00:48:31,299
- Can't keep them in stock.

597
00:48:31,473 --> 00:48:35,390
- Huh. I like it.

598
00:48:42,136 --> 00:48:44,922
Perfect.

599
00:48:48,142 --> 00:48:52,016
- They're going to love that
down at the courthouse. No,
don't, it looks good..

600
00:48:52,190 --> 00:48:53,060
- Really?

601
00:48:53,234 --> 00:48:54,322
- Yeah, you should get it.

602
00:48:54,496 --> 00:48:57,021
- No.

603
00:48:57,195 --> 00:48:59,545
- Come on, Kay, when was the
last time you bought yourself
something fun?

604
00:49:04,071 --> 00:49:06,334
You know, you actually look kind
of cool in that jacket.

605
00:49:06,508 --> 00:49:09,294
- Thanks, I think.

606
00:49:09,468 --> 00:49:11,252
- What?

607
00:49:11,426 --> 00:49:15,039
- Well, are you saying that I
wasn't cool before the jacket?

608
00:49:15,213 --> 00:49:16,344
- Well.

609
00:49:16,518 --> 00:49:18,651
- Well what?

610
00:49:18,825 --> 00:49:21,523
- No, you just, you look more
relaxed. It's a good thing.

611
00:49:21,697 --> 00:49:24,135
- Thank you then.

612
00:49:24,309 --> 00:49:30,141
[PHONE RINGS]
Excuse me. Hello. Hi, mom.

613
00:49:30,315 --> 00:49:38,062
No, no, I'm shopping. It's
okay. You guys are working this
from every angle aren't you?

614
00:49:38,236 --> 00:49:44,590
Please, please, don't start with
me. Okay, I'll, I'll tell Davis
that dad isn't feeling

615
00:49:44,764 --> 00:49:47,941
well. Bye. Can't believe it.
- What?

616
00:49:48,115 --> 00:49:51,901
- My ex husband invited my
parents to his party tonight.

617
00:49:52,076 --> 00:49:53,686
- So?

618
00:49:53,860 --> 00:49:56,167
- [LAUGH] He knows that my dad
and I aren't speaking.

619
00:49:56,341 --> 00:49:57,907
- Why aren't you speaking to
your dad?

620
00:49:58,082 --> 00:49:59,083
- Long story.

621
00:49:59,257 --> 00:50:01,694
- Come on.

622
00:50:01,868 --> 00:50:05,654
- Six months ago his firm filed
a wrongful death suit against
the power company.

623
00:50:05,828 --> 00:50:10,094
Some problems developed and they
needed time to redirect the
case.

624
00:50:10,268 --> 00:50:12,270
So he approached me, exparte,

625
00:50:12,444 --> 00:50:15,925
that means outside the courtroom
and asked me for a favor, a
delay.

626
00:50:16,100 --> 00:50:17,623
- And did you give it to him?

627
00:50:17,797 --> 00:50:19,625
- I told him if he ever
approached me again,

628
00:50:19,799 --> 00:50:22,193
I'd report him to the
California Bar Association.

629
00:50:22,367 --> 00:50:24,586
What he asked about was
inappropriate, unethical and
illegal.

630
00:50:24,760 --> 00:50:27,198
- One little favor.

631
00:50:27,372 --> 00:50:30,549
- This wasn't just a, a
mistake, it was a crime.

632
00:50:30,723 --> 00:50:31,419
- Did he apologize?

633
00:50:31,593 --> 00:50:32,681
- He tried to.

634
00:50:32,855 --> 00:50:33,943
- Did anyone get hurt?

635
00:50:34,118 --> 00:50:35,597
- No.

636
00:50:35,771 --> 00:50:37,556
- Well, then, forget it, he's
your dad.

637
00:50:37,730 --> 00:50:39,645
- It's not that simple.

638
00:50:39,819 --> 00:50:43,127
- Sure it is. You'd rather be
right than be with your parents.

639
00:50:43,301 --> 00:50:44,954
You've got your priorities all
screwed up.

640
00:50:45,129 --> 00:50:48,741
- My priorities are fine.

641
00:50:48,915 --> 00:50:52,223
- Come on, being right all the
time gets lonely. Admit it.

642
00:50:52,397 --> 00:50:56,053
- I do not have to be right all
the time.

643
00:50:56,227 --> 00:51:01,493
- You mean like now? Cut people
some slack, you take this judge
thing way too seriously.

644
00:51:06,541 --> 00:51:08,369
- Sally?
- Yeah?

645
00:51:08,543 --> 00:51:11,633
- Do you know much about your
birth parents?

646
00:51:11,807 --> 00:51:16,029
- No. And I don't want to.

647
00:51:16,203 --> 00:51:18,031
- Well, aren't you just a
little bit curious?

648
00:51:18,379 --> 00:51:20,729
- I don't want to talk about
this, okay, I told you that
before.

649
00:51:20,903 --> 00:51:24,124
- Well, there may be more to
the story than you know.

650
00:51:24,298 --> 00:51:27,606
Maybe your mom and dad hated to
give you up. Maybe they didn't
have any other choice.

651
00:51:27,780 --> 00:51:30,652
- I mean it.

652
00:51:30,826 --> 00:51:35,614
- All right, look, I won't
bring it up again, I promise.
I'm sorry.

653
00:51:35,788 --> 00:51:37,398
- I want to do my own hair.

654
00:51:37,572 --> 00:51:44,188
- And we should get ready. What
do you think?

655
00:51:44,362 --> 00:51:45,667
- You're going to wear that?

656
00:51:45,841 --> 00:51:48,496
- Basic black, it's classic.

657
00:51:48,670 --> 00:51:53,153
- Yeah, but you wear black,
like, every day to work. Don't
you have anything jazzier?

658
00:51:53,327 --> 00:51:55,416
- [LAUGH] Jazzy is not my
style.

659
00:51:55,590 --> 00:51:59,420
- Come on, Kay, this is your ex
husband's party. You have to
look hot.

660
00:51:59,594 --> 00:52:06,514
- Wait a minute, I haven't
accessorized yet.

661
00:52:06,688 --> 00:52:13,217
That's odd. Could have sworn
I put my grandmother's
brooch in here.

662
00:52:13,391 --> 00:52:16,698
- Yeah, well, you know, you
don't want to wear anything your
grandmother gave you.

663
00:52:16,872 --> 00:52:22,226
You know, you need something
flashy. Trust me, that dress
needs it.

664
00:52:22,400 --> 00:52:24,402
- Yeah.

665
00:52:24,576 --> 00:52:26,752
- Well, I'm going to get ready
myself.

666
00:52:33,802 --> 00:52:36,805
- You look gorgeous.
- No.

667
00:52:36,979 --> 00:52:40,679
- No, I mean it, Sally. You're
a beautiful young woman.

668
00:52:53,561 --> 00:52:55,781
- What are you doing here?

669
00:52:55,955 --> 00:52:58,262
- Just checking in, I hadn't
heard from you yet.

670
00:52:58,436 --> 00:52:59,611
[MAKES NOISE] Man, that dress,
it's...

671
00:52:59,785 --> 00:53:01,700
- You have to go.

672
00:53:01,874 --> 00:53:03,441
- Why, where are you off to?

673
00:53:03,615 --> 00:53:05,225
- I'll tell you later, please
just go.

674
00:53:05,399 --> 00:53:07,184
- Did you get us more stuff?

675
00:53:07,358 --> 00:53:09,534
- Just get out of here, please.

676
00:53:09,708 --> 00:53:14,408
- What's your problem? What
happens next week or next month

677
00:53:14,582 --> 00:53:16,889
or she gets tired of you, you
end up in another foster home.

678
00:53:17,063 --> 00:53:19,108
- I can't believe you.

679
00:53:19,283 --> 00:53:20,719
- I'm the one who's been with
you through all these years.
- Not.

680
00:53:20,893 --> 00:53:24,636
- What are you doing? Stop it.
Are you all right?

681
00:53:24,810 --> 00:53:26,290
- Yeah, absolutely.

682
00:53:26,464 --> 00:53:28,117
- Who is that creep?

683
00:53:28,292 --> 00:53:30,207
- Just a friend.

684
00:53:56,624 --> 00:54:04,153
- Oh, nice to see you.

685
00:54:04,328 --> 00:54:06,895
- Good evening.

686
00:54:14,512 --> 00:54:16,862
- Excuse me, be right back.

687
00:54:17,036 --> 00:54:21,170
- A really big house.

688
00:54:21,345 --> 00:54:24,261
- Oh. Davis. Good to see you.

689
00:54:24,435 --> 00:54:26,567
- Thank you.
- Happy to be here.

690
00:54:26,741 --> 00:54:28,395
- Oh, it's good to see you. And
who is this?

691
00:54:28,569 --> 00:54:31,355
- This is Sally Powell. Sally,
this is...

692
00:54:31,529 --> 00:54:34,401
- Davis Woodbury. Your
honor's favorite ex husband.

693
00:54:34,575 --> 00:54:36,316
- It's nice to meet you.

694
00:54:36,490 --> 00:54:39,537
- Yeah, very nice to meet you.
Sally are you hungry?

695
00:54:39,711 --> 00:54:43,497
I've got a ton of food out here
and attack it. There's so
much.

696
00:54:43,671 --> 00:54:46,457
You know, my source at
the courthouse told me that

697
00:54:46,631 --> 00:54:49,329
you'd taken custody of her, I
don't believe it.

698
00:54:49,503 --> 00:54:53,333
- Oh, don't give me any grief,
Davis, not after your little
reunion plot with my parents.

699
00:54:53,507 --> 00:54:55,596
- Kay, look, I know what I said
in your chambers.

700
00:54:55,770 --> 00:54:59,208
Uh, Sally is on your docket.
You're her judge.

701
00:54:59,383 --> 00:55:01,559
Have you thought through this?

702
00:55:01,733 --> 00:55:04,475
- I'm a judge half the time.
The other time I'm a private
citizen.

703
00:55:04,649 --> 00:55:06,346
I can adopt a child any time I
want.

704
00:55:06,520 --> 00:55:08,217
- Well, adopt.

705
00:55:08,392 --> 00:55:10,568
- Oh, you know what I mean.

706
00:55:10,742 --> 00:55:12,439
- Whoa, whoa, [STAMMERS] wait,
wait, wait. This coming from a
woman who

707
00:55:12,613 --> 00:55:14,572
I married who never wanted to
have a child.

708
00:55:14,746 --> 00:55:18,663
Suddenly is thinking about
adopting a teenage girl?

709
00:55:18,837 --> 00:55:21,318
- Davis, did you invite me here
for a lecture or a party?

710
00:55:21,492 --> 00:55:22,971
- I'm sorry.

711
00:55:39,118 --> 00:55:40,337
- Champagne?

712
00:55:48,040 --> 00:55:50,347
- I'm, I'm concerned.

713
00:55:50,521 --> 00:55:54,655
- Well, I appreciate that but,
uh, I know what I'm doing.

714
00:55:54,829 --> 00:56:00,487
- If you say so. Would you like
something to drink?

715
00:56:00,661 --> 00:56:02,359
- Love it.
- All right.

716
00:56:04,404 --> 00:56:06,841
- Hope I'm not interrupting.

717
00:56:07,015 --> 00:56:09,540
- Oh, no, no, not at all. Kay,
I'd like you to meet the future
Mrs. Davis Woodbury.

718
00:56:09,714 --> 00:56:12,456
- Monica Tejada. It's a real
pleasure to meet you, Judge
Woodbury.

719
00:56:12,630 --> 00:56:15,633
- Uh, call me Kay please.

720
00:56:15,807 --> 00:56:20,594
- I want to thank you so much
for coming tonight. I know it
means an awful lot to Davis.

721
00:56:20,768 --> 00:56:24,511
- In the meantime,
if you need any tips on how

722
00:56:24,685 --> 00:56:27,688
to handle Davis, I kept
extensive notes.

723
00:56:27,862 --> 00:56:31,649
- Well, I've kept quite a diary
going myself.

724
00:56:31,823 --> 00:56:35,653
- [LAUGH] He's a handful,
that's for sure.

725
00:56:35,827 --> 00:56:38,220
But, hang in
there, he's worth it.

726
00:56:45,706 --> 00:56:48,405
- Oh, my. I'm sorry.

727
00:56:50,842 --> 00:56:53,366
- Don't worry about it, it's
all right.

728
00:57:00,895 --> 00:57:03,811
- Are you okay?

729
00:57:03,985 --> 00:57:09,556
- Yeah, I'm fine.

730
00:57:09,730 --> 00:57:12,124
- You're not fine at all,
Sally.

731
00:57:12,298 --> 00:57:16,389
- How do you know my name?

732
00:57:16,563 --> 00:57:19,958
- I know quite a bit about you.

733
00:57:20,132 --> 00:57:24,745
- Are you a friend of Kay's?

734
00:57:24,919 --> 00:57:29,663
- I like Kay very much. She's a
good person.

735
00:57:29,837 --> 00:57:31,709
You're a good
person, too, Sally.

736
00:57:31,883 --> 00:57:37,497
- No I'm not.

737
00:57:37,671 --> 00:57:42,633
I took something that wasn't
mine. It belonged to Kay.

738
00:57:42,807 --> 00:57:51,163
- Sally, look at me.

739
00:57:51,337 --> 00:57:56,734
You are a kind and
wonderful person.

740
00:57:56,908 --> 00:58:01,565
You're just afraid and there's
no reason to be afraid.

741
00:58:01,739 --> 00:58:04,785
- I know who you are.

742
00:58:04,959 --> 00:58:08,572
- I'm someone who cares about
you very much.

743
00:58:08,746 --> 00:58:16,623
- I don't believe it. You're
here.

744
00:58:16,797 --> 00:58:21,585
- I've always been with you.
You know that.

745
00:58:21,759 --> 00:58:24,283
- But now I can see you.

746
00:58:35,033 --> 00:58:44,608
- Everything's going to be
better now, isn't it?
Everything's going to change.

747
00:58:44,782 --> 00:58:53,051
- You're right. Everything will
change. And everything will get
better if you let it.

748
00:58:53,225 --> 00:58:59,927
But you have to open your heart,
Sally. You have to learn to
forgive.

749
00:59:00,101 --> 00:59:07,718
'Cause if you trust and forgive,
you will be happy.

750
00:59:07,892 --> 00:59:15,726
- I can do that. If you stay
here with me.

751
00:59:15,900 --> 00:59:24,169
- I will never leave you. I
promise. I promise.

752
00:59:24,343 --> 00:59:29,696
- Sally? Who were you talking
to?

753
00:59:29,870 --> 00:59:32,830
- She was just right here.

754
00:59:33,004 --> 00:59:38,662
- Are you all right?

755
00:59:38,836 --> 00:59:41,099
- I'm a little dizzy.

756
00:59:41,273 --> 00:59:47,235
- Yeah, I can smell how dizzy
you are. Let's go. Let me help
you.

757
01:00:01,815 --> 01:00:04,862
- [PHONE RINGS] Hello.

758
01:00:05,036 --> 01:00:08,300
- Kay

759
01:00:08,474 --> 01:00:11,782
- Mom? What, what is it? What's
wrong?

760
01:00:11,956 --> 01:00:16,961
- I'm at the hospital with your 
father. He's had a heart attac.

761
01:00:17,135 --> 01:00:18,745
- I'm on my way.

762
01:00:31,279 --> 01:00:32,324
Sit here.

763
01:00:32,498 --> 01:00:34,152
- Oh, Katherine, good.

764
01:00:34,326 --> 01:00:36,067
- How is he?

765
01:00:36,241 --> 01:00:38,547
- We don't know yet. And
we're waiting for the test
results.

766
01:00:38,722 --> 01:00:39,636
Honey, who's that?

767
01:00:39,810 --> 01:00:41,638
- Sally.
- Who?

768
01:00:41,812 --> 01:00:43,204
- She's a foster child.

769
01:00:43,378 --> 01:00:45,729
- Who's foster child?

770
01:00:45,903 --> 01:00:49,602
- Mine. When do we get the test
results?

771
01:00:49,776 --> 01:00:53,084
- The, the doctor says we might
have to wait a couple of hours.

772
01:01:57,322 --> 01:01:59,803
- Hi.

773
01:01:59,977 --> 01:02:05,896
- Oh boy. I really must be sick
if you're here.

774
01:02:06,070 --> 01:02:11,945
- You stop that. You're going
to be perfectly fine.

775
01:02:12,119 --> 01:02:16,820
- [LAUGH] Is that your
diagnosis? Or the doctor?

776
01:02:16,994 --> 01:02:23,957
- Just rest. Just, please,
that's all you have to do. Just
rest.

777
01:02:24,131 --> 01:02:33,271
- Thanks for coming, Katy girl.
Are, are you still angry with
me?

778
01:02:33,445 --> 01:02:36,274
- Come on, dad.

779
01:02:36,448 --> 01:02:46,806
- Kate, I made a mistake. But I
never meant to hurt you. I just
didn't think.

780
01:02:46,980 --> 01:02:55,772
I'll make it up to you. I love
you, Katy.

781
01:02:55,946 --> 01:03:05,738
- Just rest, okay. And we'll
talk about all of this
later, I promise.

782
01:03:05,912 --> 01:03:10,961
Tell you what, we'll go to
dinner, just the two of us,

783
01:03:11,135 --> 01:03:13,485
we'll go to that, uh, the
Italian restaurant

784
01:03:13,659 --> 01:03:14,965
that you love, uh...

785
01:03:15,139 --> 01:03:17,228
- Manzanetti.

786
01:03:17,402 --> 01:03:23,060
- That's it. You and I will
have dinner at Manzanetti's, my
treat.

787
01:03:23,234 --> 01:03:25,279
- And we'll talk.

788
01:03:30,502 --> 01:03:33,810
- We've given him all the usual
tests and everything's fine.

789
01:03:33,984 --> 01:03:36,160
But just in case we'd like to
keep him here for observation.

790
01:03:36,334 --> 01:03:38,815
- Observation.

791
01:03:38,989 --> 01:03:42,340
- We just want to be on the
safe side. Really you have
nothing to worry about.

792
01:03:42,514 --> 01:03:45,430
Your father's as strong as an
ox. He isn't going anywhere.

793
01:03:45,604 --> 01:03:48,433
- Is there anything we need to
be doing?

794
01:03:48,607 --> 01:03:51,523
- Yes. You should go home and
get some rest.

795
01:03:51,697 --> 01:03:53,917
- Thank you doctor.

796
01:03:54,091 --> 01:03:57,224
- Don't let him do too much
too fast. You know how he gets.

797
01:03:57,398 --> 01:04:01,794
- Don't worry, I'll take care
of him. Uh, what are you going
to do about this one?

798
01:04:01,968 --> 01:04:07,104
- Uh, I'm not sure. I think she
stole gram's brooch.

799
01:04:07,278 --> 01:04:09,367
- What?

800
01:04:09,541 --> 01:04:11,369
- It's not where I put it and
there's some other things
missing, too.

801
01:04:11,543 --> 01:04:12,936
- Have you confronted her?

802
01:04:13,110 --> 01:04:15,155
- No. Not yet.

803
01:04:15,329 --> 01:04:19,246
- Honey, are you sure you
really want to do this?

804
01:04:19,420 --> 01:04:24,034
- I don't know. I, I don't know
what I want to do at this point.

805
01:04:24,208 --> 01:04:29,953
Mom, I'm, I'm sorry I stayed
angry for so long.

806
01:04:30,127 --> 01:04:32,129
- Don't apologize.

807
01:04:32,303 --> 01:04:35,393
- No, I shouldn't have been
so pig headed about it.

808
01:04:35,567 --> 01:04:38,439
- You're here now. That's all
that matters.

809
01:04:38,613 --> 01:04:40,137
- You're right. [LAUGH]

810
01:04:40,311 --> 01:04:41,965
- I'm always right.

811
01:04:48,536 --> 01:04:51,148
- Do you have any aspirin?

812
01:04:51,322 --> 01:04:59,330
- The cabinet by the stove. I
didn't expect to see you up
right so soon.

813
01:04:59,504 --> 01:05:03,464
- I promised Danny Katsu I'd go
roller skating with him.

814
01:05:03,638 --> 01:05:05,162
- How do you feel?

815
01:05:05,336 --> 01:05:07,555
- Sick to my stomach with a
killer headache.

816
01:05:07,729 --> 01:05:10,515
- Good.

817
01:05:10,689 --> 01:05:13,997
- I screwed up, didn't I?

818
01:05:14,171 --> 01:05:16,042
- Yep, you did.

819
01:05:16,216 --> 01:05:20,003
- I'm sorry. I guess I was just
nervous.

820
01:05:20,177 --> 01:05:22,396
- Well, at least you learned a
lesson.

821
01:05:22,570 --> 01:05:24,007
[knocking]

822
01:05:24,181 --> 01:05:27,271
- Morning, ready to roll?

823
01:05:27,445 --> 01:05:29,099
- In a sec.

824
01:05:29,273 --> 01:05:32,537
- Are you sure you're up to
this?

825
01:05:32,711 --> 01:05:35,148
- I could use some fresh air.

826
01:05:35,322 --> 01:05:37,455
- Call me if you're going to
be late.

827
01:05:37,629 --> 01:05:39,022
- Thanks, bye.

828
01:05:39,196 --> 01:05:41,024
- See you later.

829
01:06:16,189 --> 01:06:18,975
[doorbell chimes]

830
01:06:25,198 --> 01:06:26,330
- Jim.
- Hi.

831
01:06:26,504 --> 01:06:29,159
- Hi.

832
01:06:29,333 --> 01:06:33,293
- I'm guessing you didn't get
my message. I just said I'd stop
by with some drawings today.

833
01:06:33,467 --> 01:06:38,342
- I'm sorry, things
have been kind of hectic and I
haven't even checked my machine.

834
01:06:38,516 --> 01:06:40,213
- Oh, well, [LAUGH] we can do
this another time.

835
01:06:40,387 --> 01:06:47,307
- No, no, no, no. Come on in.
It's fine.

836
01:06:47,481 --> 01:06:50,484
Would you, uh, like some coffee
or something?

837
01:06:50,658 --> 01:06:55,228
- Oh, no, no, thank you. I'm
okay. I mean, if this isn't a
good time, I can come back.

838
01:06:55,402 --> 01:06:59,276
- No, I'm just tired. I was at
the hospital all night. My
father's ill.

839
01:06:59,450 --> 01:07:01,669
- Well, I hope he's okay.

840
01:07:01,843 --> 01:07:06,631
- Yeah, he's, he's holding his
own. You know what? I'm glad
you're here.

841
01:07:10,374 --> 01:07:12,637
[LAUGH] How did you get into
landscaping?

842
01:07:12,985 --> 01:07:16,641
- Actually I wanted to be an
architect. But I had an accident
and I had to leave school.

843
01:07:16,815 --> 01:07:19,252
Well, I had this buddy that was
starting a landscaping project

844
01:07:19,426 --> 01:07:21,167
and I just fell in love with it.
You know, its like life,

845
01:07:21,341 --> 01:07:23,952
you nurture some
things, you ignore the others.

846
01:07:24,127 --> 01:07:26,259
It's all about choices, right?

847
01:07:26,433 --> 01:07:29,306
- Yeah, [LAUGH] it's funny you
say that about choices.

848
01:07:29,480 --> 01:07:34,267
Because I made a big one
recently. And it's really turned
out great.

849
01:07:34,441 --> 01:07:36,791
You know Sally?
- Yeah, the girl that's living
with you, right?

850
01:07:36,965 --> 01:07:42,536
- Well, actually, she's a
foster child and she's really
smart and terrific.

851
01:07:42,710 --> 01:07:46,410
Which isn't to say that she
doesn't have problems because
we all do.

852
01:07:46,584 --> 01:07:49,587
[LAUGH] You know, I'm, [LAUGH]
I'm rambling. I'm sorry.

853
01:07:49,761 --> 01:07:55,245
But, the poor kid's really been
through a lot, kind of kicked
from pillar to post.

854
01:07:55,419 --> 01:07:58,117
She's never known what it's like
to have a real family.

855
01:07:58,291 --> 01:08:00,380
- That's a shame.

856
01:08:00,554 --> 01:08:04,776
- Yeah, yeah it is because
there's something really
special about her.

857
01:08:04,950 --> 01:08:09,302
Before I met her, I, I thought I
had the answer to everything.

858
01:08:09,476 --> 01:08:12,349
But she's made me question
myself and I think that's good.

859
01:08:12,523 --> 01:08:17,223
- Definitely. Okay, here we go.

860
01:08:17,397 --> 01:08:20,313
- I, I give up. I'm tired and
confused and

861
01:08:20,487 --> 01:08:22,098
I don't know any other way to
do this but just tell you.

862
01:08:22,272 --> 01:08:24,274
- Tell me what, Kay?

863
01:08:24,448 --> 01:08:28,060
- Sally's not just a foster
child. She's your daughter.

864
01:08:28,234 --> 01:08:30,106
- What?

865
01:08:30,280 --> 01:08:32,586
- It's true. She's your little
girl.

866
01:08:32,760 --> 01:08:37,200
She had no place to go so I took
her in and then I found out that
you were her father.

867
01:08:37,374 --> 01:08:40,464
I'm sorry, I know this must be a
shock.

868
01:08:40,638 --> 01:08:42,248
- Does she know? [STAMMERS]
Does she know who I am?

869
01:08:42,422 --> 01:08:44,076
- No, she has no idea.

870
01:08:44,250 --> 01:08:47,384
- Oh, I, I, I have to go. Okay.

871
01:08:47,558 --> 01:08:49,081
- I'm serious, you did really
well for a beginner. [LAUGH]

872
01:08:49,255 --> 01:08:51,518
- Thanks, it was fun.

873
01:08:51,692 --> 01:09:00,223
- Yeah. It was. So, um, you
want to play chess a little
later?

874
01:09:00,397 --> 01:09:02,616
- Sure.

875
01:09:06,881 --> 01:09:11,234
Kay, I'm back in one
piece.

876
01:09:13,410 --> 01:09:15,847
- You must have been curious.
You must have thought about her.

877
01:09:16,021 --> 01:09:17,370
- Of course I thought about
her.

878
01:09:17,544 --> 01:09:19,024
- Well, then, why didn't you
try to find her?

879
01:09:19,242 --> 01:09:20,808
- Because it doesn't matter,
she already hates me.

880
01:09:20,982 --> 01:09:22,549
- How could she hate you, she
doesn't even know you.

881
01:09:22,723 --> 01:09:24,595
- Kay, what do you want me to
do, march in there with

882
01:09:24,769 --> 01:09:26,249
16 years worth of birthday
presents and beg for
forgiveness?

883
01:09:26,423 --> 01:09:29,165
- Of course not.

884
01:09:29,339 --> 01:09:31,863
- Look, I failed her. Okay, I
gave up my own flesh and blood
because I was scared and weak.

885
01:09:32,037 --> 01:09:34,431
- No one's judging you.

886
01:09:34,605 --> 01:09:36,694
- Look, I don't care what
anybody else thinks about me, I
know what I did was wrong.

887
01:09:36,868 --> 01:09:39,871
- Give her a chance. Sally's a
terrific kid. You'll be proud of
her. I know.

888
01:09:40,045 --> 01:09:41,742
- You just don't get it, do
you?

889
01:09:41,916 --> 01:09:44,789
- Yes, I do. I know you made a
mistake but you're lucky.

890
01:09:44,963 --> 01:09:48,401
Because you have a chance to
correct it. Jim,

891
01:09:48,575 --> 01:09:50,316
you have a remarkable daughter
who needs a father.

892
01:09:50,490 --> 01:09:54,668
She deserves a second chance and
so do you.

893
01:09:58,019 --> 01:10:00,979
- Kay, where are you?

894
01:10:20,607 --> 01:10:23,306
- What must she think of me?

895
01:10:34,447 --> 01:10:36,101
- Oh my God.

896
01:10:45,893 --> 01:10:48,069
You liar.

897
01:10:48,244 --> 01:10:50,333
- I can't, I, I can't do it.
Kay, I can't fix what's wrong
with her.

898
01:10:50,507 --> 01:10:52,465
I mean, I wouldn't know where
to start.

899
01:10:52,639 --> 01:10:54,424
- What's wrong with her is she
doesn't have a dad around to
talk to.

900
01:10:54,598 --> 01:10:57,557
- It's too late, okay? Come on,
just happens.

901
01:10:57,731 --> 01:11:00,473
- She's your
daughter, she's your
responsibility.

902
01:11:00,647 --> 01:11:01,866
- You had no right.

903
01:11:46,954 --> 01:11:48,304
- Sally.

904
01:13:52,732 --> 01:13:57,650
- What's going on? Why'd you
want to meet me here?

905
01:13:57,824 --> 01:14:02,438
[LAUGH]
San Francisco, open your golden
gates.

906
01:14:02,612 --> 01:14:04,875
- Let's just get out of here,
now.

907
01:14:22,936 --> 01:14:25,983
- Na uh, you stay here.
You're a minor, remember.

908
01:14:45,263 --> 01:14:46,960
[making call]

909
01:14:50,703 --> 01:14:54,707
- Come on, come on. Pick up.

910
01:14:54,881 --> 01:14:57,449
- [phone ringing] Put it all in
the bag.

911
01:14:57,623 --> 01:14:58,755
Now.

912
01:14:58,929 --> 01:15:00,670
Don't even think about it.

913
01:15:00,844 --> 01:15:04,848
All right, all right. All right,
all right, hey.

914
01:15:05,022 --> 01:15:06,763
[STAMMERS] That's all I got,
that's it, that's it.

915
01:15:06,937 --> 01:15:11,071
All I got, that's all I got.
That's all I got, all right?

916
01:15:11,245 --> 01:15:12,508
- All right.

917
01:15:18,339 --> 01:15:19,732
- Oh my God, what did you do?

918
01:15:19,906 --> 01:15:20,646
- We needed some money, and I
got us some.

919
01:15:20,820 --> 01:15:23,693
- Did you hurt anyone?

920
01:15:23,867 --> 01:15:25,608
- GO He's got a gun

921
01:15:29,916 --> 01:15:31,657
- Sally.

922
01:15:37,271 --> 01:15:39,491
Did you get a license
number?
- Yeah, I got it.

923
01:15:39,665 --> 01:15:40,971
- Well, then call the police.

924
01:15:44,801 --> 01:15:46,803
- You're an idiot. What were
thinking?

925
01:15:46,977 --> 01:15:49,762
- Ow. Stop it, I
can't see.

926
01:15:49,936 --> 01:15:52,156
- You're crazy. Are you out
of your mind? You got to get me
out of here please.

927
01:15:52,330 --> 01:15:53,723
You're driving like a maniac.

928
01:15:53,897 --> 01:15:55,333
- [OVERLAPPING] God, would you
calm down?

929
01:16:00,773 --> 01:16:02,079
- Get me out of this car, let
me out right now.

930
01:16:02,253 --> 01:16:03,210
- [OVERLAPPING] Sally, calm
down.

931
01:16:03,384 --> 01:16:04,647
- I want out of this car now.

932
01:16:04,821 --> 01:16:06,562
- Okay.

933
01:16:09,216 --> 01:16:14,657
- Get me out of this car right
now.

934
01:16:14,831 --> 01:16:15,440
- What is wrong with you?
- I never want to see you again.

935
01:16:15,745 --> 01:16:17,660
- I just did this for us.

936
01:16:17,834 --> 01:16:20,576
Here, here, have a nice life.
Look, I'm out of here.

937
01:16:34,894 --> 01:16:37,070
- We'll let you know as soon
as we hear anything.

938
01:16:37,244 --> 01:16:40,639
If you give me your cell phone
number then, uh, I'll call you
right away.

939
01:16:40,813 --> 01:16:45,122
- Kay.

940
01:16:45,296 --> 01:16:50,867
- Excuse me. Oh, thank God.

941
01:16:51,041 --> 01:16:52,912
Are you all right? He
didn't hurt you.

942
01:16:53,086 --> 01:16:56,568
- No. But he took all the money
from your jewelry.

943
01:16:56,742 --> 01:16:59,266
- Oh, forget the jewelry,
it's okay.

944
01:16:59,440 --> 01:17:00,964
- I'm so sorry.

945
01:17:01,138 --> 01:17:02,705
- It's okay.

946
01:17:02,879 --> 01:17:05,708
- No, it's not, I stole your
stuff.

947
01:17:05,882 --> 01:17:10,103
- You stole it because you were
angry with me and you had every
right to be.

948
01:17:10,277 --> 01:17:15,152
What I did was wrong. I should
have told you about your father.

949
01:17:15,326 --> 01:17:18,546
I'm so sorry, Sally.

950
01:17:18,721 --> 01:17:21,158
- He left, didn't he?

951
01:17:21,332 --> 01:17:27,773
- He's scared. People run when
they're scared.

952
01:17:27,947 --> 01:17:30,297
- Do you think he's going to be
back?

953
01:17:30,471 --> 01:17:32,648
- I don't know.

954
01:17:32,822 --> 01:17:35,563
- Pardon me, judge. Is
everything okay here?

955
01:17:35,738 --> 01:17:37,174
- Yeah.

956
01:17:37,348 --> 01:17:39,829
- She's fine officer. Thank
you.

957
01:17:40,003 --> 01:17:44,660
- I'll need to talk to you when
you're done.

958
01:17:44,834 --> 01:17:46,662
- Am I going back to jail?

959
01:17:46,836 --> 01:17:49,186
- Oh, don't worry about it.
We'll take care of it.

960
01:17:49,360 --> 01:17:54,582
- Thank you.

961
01:17:54,757 --> 01:17:56,628
What's wrong with me, Kay?

962
01:17:56,802 --> 01:17:59,675
- There's nothing wrong with
you.

963
01:17:59,849 --> 01:18:00,850
- Yes, there is.

964
01:18:01,024 --> 01:18:02,852
- No, there's not.

965
01:18:03,026 --> 01:18:05,637
- No matter where I go or what
I do, I always end up alone.

966
01:18:05,811 --> 01:18:07,683
I don't fit in anywhere.

967
01:18:07,857 --> 01:18:11,643
- Oh, that's not
true. You fit just perfectly
right here.

01:19:10,528 --> 01:19:11,921
- You're coming aren't you?

969
01:19:12,095 --> 01:19:13,749
- Are you sure?

970
01:19:13,923 --> 01:19:16,229
- Absolutely. She'll want to
see you, too.

971
01:19:42,865 --> 01:19:45,911
- Kay. Over here.

972
01:20:00,883 --> 01:20:06,802
Hey, mom, it's me.

973
01:20:06,976 --> 01:20:09,282
Oh, sorry I didn't come to
see you sooner,

974
01:20:09,456 --> 01:20:15,549
but, uh, now that I know where
you are, I'll come a lot more
often.

975
01:20:15,723 --> 01:20:24,950
I promise. I'm doing a lot
better, just like you said I
would.

976
01:20:25,124 --> 01:20:27,823
And Kay's taking really good
care of me.

977
01:20:34,917 --> 01:20:38,268
I think about you
all the time, mom.

978
01:20:56,982 --> 01:20:59,289
- It's okay.

979
01:21:38,415 --> 01:21:39,416
- Kay.
