353
00:25:22,034 --> 00:25:23,819
Oh, and good morning
to you, too.

354
00:25:23,862 --> 00:25:25,690
<i>Shove it up your ass, Carter.</i>

355
00:25:25,734 --> 00:25:28,215
<i>He's been asleep
for 5,000 years.</i>

356
00:25:28,259 --> 00:25:31,741
<i>He'll be disoriented at first.
The longer he has to adapt,</i>

357
00:25:31,784 --> 00:25:33,656
<i>the harder it will be
to take him down.</i>

358
00:25:35,135 --> 00:25:36,572
Wheels up in 30.

359
00:25:36,615 --> 00:25:38,356
<i>Who's on the team?</i>

360
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:40,010
[bicycle rattling]

361
00:25:47,887 --> 00:25:49,498
- [beeping]
- [female voice] <i>Welcome.</i>

362
00:25:49,541 --> 00:25:51,369
<i>Please state your name
for identification.</i>

363
00:25:51,413 --> 00:25:55,068
Uh, hi. I'm Maxine Hunkel.
I'm here to see Mr. Hall.

364
00:25:55,112 --> 00:25:56,722
<i>Confirmed. Welcome, Maxine.</i>

365
00:25:56,766 --> 00:25:58,245
Thanks!

366
00:25:58,289 --> 00:26:00,335
[Carter] <i>Maxine Hunkel,</i>
<i>aka Cyclone.</i>

367
00:26:00,378 --> 00:26:04,164
<i>Wind manipulation powers,
computer skills, smart as hell.</i>

368
00:26:04,208 --> 00:26:08,213
<i>Basically a tornado
with a 167 IQ.</i>

369
00:26:08,256 --> 00:26:09,867
[Waller] <i>Sounds delightful.</i>

370
00:26:09,910 --> 00:26:11,956
<i>But please tell me
you found someone</i>

371
00:26:11,999 --> 00:26:13,523
<i>who can pack a punch.</i>

372
00:26:13,566 --> 00:26:15,786
That's where Atom Smasher
comes in.

373
00:26:15,829 --> 00:26:18,702
Al Rothstein, nephew
to the original Atom Smasher.

374
00:26:18,745 --> 00:26:20,356
- He inherited his uncle's powers.
- [phone vibrating]

375
00:26:22,183 --> 00:26:24,403
<i>- How's my suit? Does it fit?</i>
- No, yeah. It's perfect.

376
00:26:24,447 --> 00:26:26,144
Thank you again
for letting me borrow it.

377
00:26:26,187 --> 00:26:28,146
You know, I used to watch you
all the time as a kid?

378
00:26:28,189 --> 00:26:30,584
This is literally the only thing
that I'd ever wanted in my...

379
00:26:30,628 --> 00:26:32,847
<i>Yeah, yeah, yeah. Don't
let anything happen to it.</i>

380
00:26:32,891 --> 00:26:34,414
<i>It's vintage.</i>

381
00:26:34,458 --> 00:26:36,155
<i>And don't let anything
happen to you, either.</i>

382
00:26:36,198 --> 00:26:37,635
<i>Don't do anything crazy.
You listen to Carter.</i>

383
00:26:37,678 --> 00:26:39,550
I'm gonna make you proud,
Uncle Al. I promise.

384
00:26:42,465 --> 00:26:43,771
<i>They seem green.</i>

385
00:26:43,815 --> 00:26:44,990
That's why I called in Kent.

386
00:26:47,949 --> 00:26:49,777
[Carter] <i>Kent's been out
of action for a little while,</i>

387
00:26:49,821 --> 00:26:51,910
<i>but I can't do this without him.</i>

388
00:26:51,953 --> 00:26:54,216
<i>Takes magic to fight magic
and the man's got</i>

389
00:26:54,260 --> 00:26:55,740
<i>nearly God-level powers.</i>

390
00:27:01,572 --> 00:27:03,966
<i>It might take
a lot more than that.</i>

391
00:27:04,010 --> 00:27:05,968
<i>Are you sure they can take him?</i>

392
00:27:06,012 --> 00:27:09,232
Waller, you find us a cell
that can hold him...

393
00:27:09,276 --> 00:27:10,930
we'll take care of the rest.

394
00:27:10,973 --> 00:27:12,017
<i>Good luck.</i>

395
00:27:17,719 --> 00:27:19,068
This is gonna be fun.

396
00:27:29,470 --> 00:27:31,080
[grunting]

397
00:27:31,124 --> 00:27:32,430
- [sharp scream]
- [gasps]

398
00:27:33,475 --> 00:27:35,477
[exhales]

399
00:27:35,521 --> 00:27:38,393
- [chauffeur] We're here, sir.
- [groans] Hmm? Oh, right.

400
00:27:42,876 --> 00:27:44,443
Was I staring again?

401
00:27:44,486 --> 00:27:47,271
- Only half an hour or so, sir.
- Hmm.

402
00:27:47,315 --> 00:27:48,838
Maybe next time, honk the horn?

403
00:27:48,882 --> 00:27:49,926
Of course, sir.

404
00:28:05,855 --> 00:28:07,727
[Cyclone]
So what's the op?

405
00:28:07,770 --> 00:28:09,120
[Hawkman] We're headed to
Kahndaq to apprehend and contain

406
00:28:09,163 --> 00:28:11,034
a Class-A rogue metahuman.

407
00:28:11,078 --> 00:28:12,602
[Atom Smasher]
I didn't bring a passport.

408
00:28:12,646 --> 00:28:16,649
We don't need passports.
We're the Justice Society.

409
00:28:24,222 --> 00:28:26,703
[Cyclone] Is this entirely made
out of Nth metal?

410
00:28:26,747 --> 00:28:29,141
[Hawkman]
Everything down to the screws.

411
00:28:29,185 --> 00:28:31,621
Completely indestructible.

412
00:28:31,665 --> 00:28:33,362
I'll be in the cockpit
if you need me.

413
00:28:35,931 --> 00:28:37,497
It's pretty cool.
You got any snacks?

414
00:28:40,544 --> 00:28:42,285
It takes a lot of energy
to smash atoms.

415
00:28:47,246 --> 00:28:50,119
[jet powering up]

416
00:28:56,038 --> 00:28:57,083
Here.

417
00:28:57,953 --> 00:28:59,042
Oh! Thanks.

418
00:29:00,999 --> 00:29:02,567
I'm Al, by the way.

419
00:29:02,611 --> 00:29:03,741
Maxine.

420
00:29:04,829 --> 00:29:07,703
[electronics humming]

421
00:29:09,792 --> 00:29:10,967
What do you do?

422
00:29:11,010 --> 00:29:12,838
Wind. You?

423
00:29:12,882 --> 00:29:13,969
I grow.

424
00:29:14,710 --> 00:29:15,624
Cool.

425
00:29:30,943 --> 00:29:33,076
[woman wailing]

426
00:29:33,119 --> 00:29:34,904
[sobbing]

427
00:29:44,001 --> 00:29:45,349
[young man] Whoa!

428
00:30:00,670 --> 00:30:02,541
Don't worry about that.
I can get another one.

429
00:30:06,371 --> 00:30:08,155
Uh, my mom's
not much of a doctor,

430
00:30:08,199 --> 00:30:09,766
but you should probably
leave th...

431
00:30:11,769 --> 00:30:13,030
[laughing] Or do that.

432
00:30:17,513 --> 00:30:19,037
I know you have a lot
to catch up on.

433
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:21,430
But I was thinking
we could help each other.

434
00:30:21,474 --> 00:30:23,694
- Move.
- I'm Amon, by the way.

435
00:30:23,737 --> 00:30:25,043
I didn't ask for your name.

436
00:30:25,086 --> 00:30:26,435
You're Teth Adam, right?

437
00:30:26,479 --> 00:30:28,176
Everyone in Kahndaq
knows your story.

438
00:30:28,220 --> 00:30:29,917
- I said move.
- My mom said you took out

439
00:30:29,961 --> 00:30:31,702
a bunch of Intergang soldiers
in the desert.

440
00:30:31,745 --> 00:30:33,269
Because they wouldn't move
out of my way.

441
00:30:33,312 --> 00:30:34,836
So you can really fly
and stop bullets,

442
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:36,621
'cause that's really crucial
to my plan.

443
00:30:36,664 --> 00:30:38,274
And is it really you stopping
the bullets, or is it the suit?

444
00:30:38,318 --> 00:30:40,059
Wait, what's your top speed?

445
00:30:40,102 --> 00:30:41,451
I'm sure you're fast, but
how fast? Like Flash fast?

446
00:30:48,633 --> 00:30:50,635
Wait, did you really not
have mirrors back then?

447
00:30:52,506 --> 00:30:54,639
Wow, I guess a lot does
change in 5,000 years.

448
00:30:57,554 --> 00:30:59,079
Five thousand years?

449
00:30:59,122 --> 00:31:00,646
Yeah, that's how long
you were in the tomb.

450
00:31:00,689 --> 00:31:02,648
Until my mom woke you up.

451
00:31:02,691 --> 00:31:05,127
So you've got stopping bullets,
check. Flying, check.

452
00:31:05,171 --> 00:31:06,868
And lightning thing,
that's a big check.

453
00:31:10,655 --> 00:31:13,093
[traffic humming faintly]

454
00:31:13,136 --> 00:31:14,442
I don't know this place.

455
00:31:14,485 --> 00:31:15,834
This is your home.

456
00:31:19,576 --> 00:31:20,883
Then my home is gone.

457
00:31:36,943 --> 00:31:38,205
What happened to the crown?

458
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:40,687
- Too much?
- [sighs]

459
00:31:44,342 --> 00:31:46,736
[Adrianna] You know it's
cursed with demons, right?

460
00:31:46,780 --> 00:31:50,174
[music from "The Good, The Bad
And The Ugly" playing on TV]

00:31:56,746 --> 00:32:00,881
"Life is the...
only path to death."

462
00:32:02,447 --> 00:32:03,667
No shit.

463
00:32:07,410 --> 00:32:10,805
"Teth Adam was a Bronze Age
Kahndaqi demi-God.

464
00:32:10,848 --> 00:32:14,852
He defeated King Ahk-Ton
in approximately 2,600 BC."

465
00:32:14,896 --> 00:32:16,593
There. That's you. See?

466
00:32:16,636 --> 00:32:17,899
That's the statue
they built of you.

467
00:32:17,942 --> 00:32:19,727
And now you're back.

468
00:32:19,770 --> 00:32:21,076
Our country's been oppressed
by one invader after another

469
00:32:21,119 --> 00:32:23,382
ever since you left.

470
00:32:23,426 --> 00:32:26,211
My point is,
Kahndaq still isn't free.

471
00:32:26,255 --> 00:32:28,344
We could really use a superhero
right about now.

472
00:32:29,389 --> 00:32:31,261
I'm no hero.

473
00:32:31,304 --> 00:32:33,828
[Amon] What?
Superman, Batman, Aquaman...

474
00:32:33,871 --> 00:32:35,743
You're way more stacked
than any of them.

475
00:32:35,786 --> 00:32:38,094
And they're not coming
to Kahndaq to save us.

476
00:32:38,137 --> 00:32:40,313
But you could stop Intergang
all by yourself,

477
00:32:40,357 --> 00:32:41,706
just like you did King Ahk-Ton.

478
00:32:41,750 --> 00:32:42,924
You're our only hope.

479
00:32:45,666 --> 00:32:47,364

00:33:07,820 --> 00:33:09,822
- Wizards.
- [chuckles]

483
00:33:09,866 --> 00:33:11,345
I can fix it. Don't worry.

484
00:33:13,521 --> 00:33:15,480
I'm not a wizard.
[tense breathing]

485
00:33:16,916 --> 00:33:19,875
[laughing] Hey, Mom.
He's awake.

486
00:33:19,919 --> 00:33:21,528
I told you
not to go in your room.

487
00:33:22,574 --> 00:33:23,793
It was you who spoke.

488
00:33:26,056 --> 00:33:27,971
You woke me.

489
00:33:28,014 --> 00:33:30,321
I didn't have a choice. I'd
be dead if it hadn't worked.

490
00:33:30,365 --> 00:33:32,150
The men in my tomb,
they were your enemies?

491
00:33:32,193 --> 00:33:34,412
- Yes.
- Then your enemies are vanquished,

492
00:33:34,455 --> 00:33:36,414
condemned to the eternal
sleep of the damned.

493
00:33:36,457 --> 00:33:39,025
Actually, we still have a lot of
enemies that need vanquishing.

494
00:33:39,070 --> 00:33:40,854
Then destroy them.

495
00:33:40,898 --> 00:33:43,030
Intergang have guns and
flybikes and Eternium rockets.

496
00:33:43,074 --> 00:33:44,161
We have my mom.

497
00:33:45,771 --> 00:33:47,208
Prove your strength.

498
00:33:47,252 --> 00:33:48,862
Destroy your enemy
and all he cares about.

499
00:33:48,906 --> 00:33:50,255
Make him beg for mercy,

500
00:33:50,298 --> 00:33:52,561
but deny it
until his final breath.

501
00:33:52,605 --> 00:33:54,085
Interesting, okay?

502
00:33:54,128 --> 00:33:55,738
I appreciate
what you did for me,

503
00:33:55,782 --> 00:33:58,872
but I do not want you
teaching my son violence.

504
00:34:00,179 --> 00:34:02,571
I understand.
You want his father

505
00:34:02,615 --> 00:34:04,095
- to teach him violence.
- [coughs]

506
00:34:04,138 --> 00:34:05,879
- Gross, that's my brother.
- That's my sister.

507
00:34:05,923 --> 00:34:07,794
- His father's dead.
- I'm sorry.

508
00:34:09,622 --> 00:34:11,363
Who do you want
to teach him violence then?

509
00:34:11,406 --> 00:34:13,975
Yeah, Mom. Who do you want
to teach me violence?

510
00:34:14,019 --> 00:34:15,672
No one.

511
00:34:15,716 --> 00:34:19,589
I want a champion to help
free Kahndaq from Intergang.

512
00:34:20,895 --> 00:34:22,244
Please, help us.

513
00:34:29,208 --> 00:34:31,515
[panting]

514
00:34:40,698 --> 00:34:41,830
[Amon] Wait! Wait.

515
00:34:43,396 --> 00:34:46,226
- Where are you going?
- I shouldn't be here.

516
00:34:46,269 --> 00:34:48,444
You don't feel any loyalty
to us at all?

517
00:34:48,488 --> 00:34:49,925
Not really, no.

518
00:34:49,969 --> 00:34:51,492
You're not seeing
the full possibilities here.

519
00:34:51,535 --> 00:34:53,494
I don't know what it was like
in ancient times,

520
00:34:53,537 --> 00:34:55,626
but having superpowers is
kind of a big deal in our world.

521
00:34:55,669 --> 00:34:57,193
Maybe clean up your outfit
a little bit,

522
00:34:57,237 --> 00:34:58,542
get a cape, change your name.

523
00:34:58,586 --> 00:35:00,327
Teth Adam is a very strong name.

524
00:35:00,370 --> 00:35:01,763
It's a little outdated.

525
00:35:01,806 --> 00:35:03,243
And you definitely
need a catchphrase.

526
00:35:03,286 --> 00:35:04,854
Something blackout
bad-ass to say

527
00:35:04,897 --> 00:35:07,160
right before you absolutely
cook some dude.

528
00:35:07,203 --> 00:35:08,683
I don't waste words on the dead.

529
00:35:08,726 --> 00:35:10,511
Well, yeah, kind of like that,
but more catchy.

530
00:35:10,554 --> 00:35:11,948
I was thinking, like,

531
00:35:11,992 --> 00:35:14,037
"Tell them the Man in Black
sent you."

532
00:35:14,081 --> 00:35:15,647
- Them?
- You know, gods, demons...

533
00:35:15,691 --> 00:35:17,780
Whoever's waiting for us
in the afterlife.

534
00:35:17,823 --> 00:35:19,564
And you wear a lot of black, so
we should really lean into that.

535
00:35:19,608 --> 00:35:22,263
My point is,
you could be famous.

536
00:35:22,306 --> 00:35:24,308
Magazines, lunch boxes,
video games.

537
00:35:24,352 --> 00:35:27,311
And the superhero industrial
complex is worth a lot of money.

538
00:35:27,355 --> 00:35:29,357
I don't need a box for my lunch.

539
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:31,098
Anyone you've ever known
is dead.

540
00:35:34,102 --> 00:35:35,450
What else are you gonna do?

541
00:35:36,973 --> 00:35:39,280
[people exclaiming]

542
00:35:40,629 --> 00:35:42,370
Wait! Where are you going?

543
00:35:43,719 --> 00:35:45,982
[people chattering excitedly]

544
00:35:58,169 --> 00:36:00,911
Waller's file needs a bit
to be desired.

545
00:36:00,955 --> 00:36:02,739
Most of this was
considered a myth

546
00:36:02,782 --> 00:36:04,610
until yesterday afternoon.

547
00:36:04,654 --> 00:36:07,962
He's a bad man, Kent.
What else do you need to know?

548
00:36:08,005 --> 00:36:10,051
When you've seen as many
different futures as I have,

549
00:36:10,094 --> 00:36:12,401
you cease to believe
in absolutes.

550
00:36:12,445 --> 00:36:14,230
[wry chuckle]

551
00:36:14,273 --> 00:36:16,101
What are you laughing at?

552
00:36:16,145 --> 00:36:18,973
I'm not laughing.
That was a smirk.

553
00:36:19,016 --> 00:36:21,324
I know.
That's how you laugh.

554
00:36:21,367 --> 00:36:22,759
I've missed having you around

555
00:36:22,802 --> 00:36:25,763
to spout old cryptic shit
like that.

556
00:36:25,806 --> 00:36:27,808
Almost as much as I've missed
having you around

557
00:36:27,852 --> 00:36:30,115
to ignore all my advice.
Carter...

558
00:36:31,899 --> 00:36:33,424
This is not a very good plan.

559
00:36:37,688 --> 00:36:39,733
Yeah, well...

560
00:36:39,777 --> 00:36:41,909
A bad plan is better than
no plan at all.

561
00:36:44,304 --> 00:36:45,871
If only there were
a third option.

562
00:36:49,657 --> 00:36:51,659
[Cyclone] I wouldn't touch that
if I was you.

563
00:36:52,486 --> 00:36:53,965
Why not?

564
00:36:54,009 --> 00:36:55,533
'Cause that helmet
is from another planet.

565
00:36:55,576 --> 00:36:56,925
It's millions of years old.

566
00:36:56,969 --> 00:36:58,623
It chooses who it lets touch it.

567
00:36:59,928 --> 00:37:01,626
- Like Kent?
- Yeah.

568
00:37:01,669 --> 00:37:05,238
Like, Kent is literally
possessed when he puts it on.

569
00:37:05,282 --> 00:37:06,806
What happens
if I touch it anyway?

570
00:37:06,848 --> 00:37:10,070
Soul crushing terror?
Or... something.

571
00:37:10,114 --> 00:37:12,985
So we should probably
put a towel on it, right?

572
00:37:13,029 --> 00:37:14,421
[Hawkman] Coming up on it.

573
00:37:14,465 --> 00:37:16,641
Ready stations in five.

574
00:37:16,684 --> 00:37:19,123
Hey, why is this Adam dude
so pissed off?

575
00:37:19,166 --> 00:37:20,472
[Carter]
He's not some dude.

576
00:37:20,515 --> 00:37:23,604
He's a weapon
of mass destruction.

577
00:37:23,648 --> 00:37:25,694
You don't have to
raise your hand.

578
00:37:25,738 --> 00:37:28,262
Question, if he's so powerful,
how are we supposed to stop him?

579
00:37:28,306 --> 00:37:31,222
If we can get him
to say the word, "Shazam,"

580
00:37:31,265 --> 00:37:33,441
Teth Adam will lose his power.

581
00:37:33,485 --> 00:37:34,921
And we're hoping since he's had

582
00:37:34,964 --> 00:37:37,315
a few thousand years
to sleep it off,

583
00:37:37,358 --> 00:37:40,753
we can peacefully negotiate
the terms of his existence.

584
00:37:40,796 --> 00:37:42,755
From the footage you showed us,
he doesn't really seem like

585
00:37:42,798 --> 00:37:44,801
a "peacefully negotiate"
kind of guy.

586
00:37:44,845 --> 00:37:46,150
Correct.

587
00:37:46,193 --> 00:37:47,282
Look alive.

588
00:37:49,979 --> 00:37:50,851
We're here.

589
00:37:54,289 --> 00:37:55,638
[sighing]

590
00:37:57,858 --> 00:38:00,774
- [entry bell chimes]
- [townspeople chattering]

591
00:38:27,193 --> 00:38:28,455
[sobbing]

592
00:38:29,195 --> 00:38:30,761
[wailing]

593
00:38:32,894 --> 00:38:34,287
[speaking in Kahndaqi]

594
00:38:41,816 --> 00:38:43,818
[indistinct chatter]

595
00:38:48,475 --> 00:38:49,912
[Amon] This is a message

596
00:38:49,955 --> 00:38:51,435
- for all Intergang soldiers.
- Hey! Stop!

597
00:38:51,479 --> 00:38:52,609
Kahndaq has its own
official superhero now.

598
00:38:59,835 --> 00:39:00,836
[grunting loudly]

599
00:39:17,245 --> 00:39:18,245
Teth Adam!

600
00:39:20,595 --> 00:39:22,511
[quietly] Please.

601
00:39:22,554 --> 00:39:25,643
- There he is! Move!
- [people exclaiming]

602
00:39:25,687 --> 00:39:28,299
- Teth Adam!
- [checkpoint leader] Move!

603
00:39:28,343 --> 00:39:30,475
- Teth Adam...! [grunting]
- [grunts]

604
00:39:30,519 --> 00:39:33,174
Get up! Who's gonna
save you now, mate?

605
00:39:36,742 --> 00:39:37,917
The statue?

606
00:39:39,702 --> 00:39:41,269
[Adrianna] That's my son.

607
00:39:41,312 --> 00:39:43,576
He's just a boy. He doesn't
know what he's doing.

608
00:39:44,663 --> 00:39:46,535
What are you doing?

609
00:39:46,578 --> 00:39:49,451
Hang on. I recognize you.

610
00:39:49,494 --> 00:39:50,888
Where is the crown?

611
00:39:52,237 --> 00:39:53,542
- [grunting]
- Let's go!

612
00:39:54,718 --> 00:39:55,849
[Adrianna grunts]

613
00:40:00,245 --> 00:40:01,768
[crowd murmuring]

614
00:40:05,729 --> 00:40:08,297
[screaming faintly]

615
00:40:08,340 --> 00:40:09,647
You could've showed up
a bit sooner.

616
00:40:09,690 --> 00:40:10,777
But that was dope.

617
00:40:16,436 --> 00:40:17,523
We need backup down here.

618
00:40:18,569 --> 00:40:19,743
[gun clicking]

619
00:40:32,016 --> 00:40:37,240
[music from "The Good,
The Bad And The Ugly" playing]

620
00:40:48,599 --> 00:40:49,992
[grunting]

621
00:40:52,081 --> 00:40:53,648
[screaming]

622
00:40:53,692 --> 00:40:54,910
[screams, grunts]

623
00:40:54,954 --> 00:40:56,259
[Amon laughs]

624
00:40:58,523 --> 00:41:00,089
Tell them
the Man in Black sent you.

625
00:41:00,133 --> 00:41:02,788
Well, yes, but not to me.
Say it to the bad guys.

626
00:41:04,268 --> 00:41:05,530
But before you zap them.

627
00:41:05,573 --> 00:41:07,271
- Catchphrase, then kill.
- Yes.

628
00:41:07,314 --> 00:41:08,533
[machine guns firing]

629
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:13,451
[tower soldiers screaming]

630
00:41:27,814 --> 00:41:28,989
[grunts]

631
00:41:30,077 --> 00:41:31,251
He's here.

632
00:41:31,296 --> 00:41:32,384
You sense his presence?

633
00:41:32,427 --> 00:41:34,690
No.

634
00:41:34,734 --> 00:41:37,650
I assume he's the only person
in Kahndaq that can do that.

635
00:41:39,782 --> 00:41:40,870
[Cyclone gasps]

636
00:41:43,961 --> 00:41:46,485
[soldiers gasping, whimpering]

637
00:41:48,749 --> 00:41:51,664
Fate and I'll take the lead.
Listen...

638
00:41:51,707 --> 00:41:53,709
Now, you two hang back
'til we call you.

639
00:41:53,753 --> 00:41:55,320
We're the anvil,
you're the hammer.

640
00:41:55,363 --> 00:41:57,060
You're ready.

641
00:41:57,104 --> 00:41:58,759
- [soldiers screaming]
- Uh, he just dropped the, um...

642
00:41:58,801 --> 00:42:00,456
- [soldiers screaming faintly]
- Shit!

643
00:42:01,805 --> 00:42:04,372
[wind whistling]

644
00:42:06,680 --> 00:42:07,811
Be prepared.

645
00:42:10,205 --> 00:42:12,599
[electronic alert beeping]

646
00:42:15,471 --> 00:42:16,734
Um...

647
00:42:20,564 --> 00:42:23,131
[screaming]

648
00:42:26,483 --> 00:42:27,919
[both yelling]

649
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:29,965
Behind you!

650
00:42:31,836 --> 00:42:33,447
[soldiers yelling]

651
00:42:39,757 --> 00:42:41,280

652
00:42:41,324 --> 00:42:43,631
[crowd jeering]

653
00:42:43,674 --> 00:42:44,850
Let us be!

654
00:42:46,461 --> 00:42:48,723
I don't know their crimes,
but whatever they are,

655
00:42:48,766 --> 00:42:50,681
these men should face
due process.

656
00:42:53,337 --> 00:42:54,991
[crowd cheering]

657
00:42:55,034 --> 00:42:56,688
Then let the gods
make their judgment.

658
00:42:56,732 --> 00:42:58,341
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

659
00:42:58,385 --> 00:43:00,431
You don't look like
an Intergang.

660
00:43:00,475 --> 00:43:02,955
We're the Justice Society.

661
00:43:02,999 --> 00:43:06,306
Our mission is to protect
global stability.

662
00:43:06,350 --> 00:43:09,745
We're here to restore
peace to Kahndaq.

663
00:43:09,788 --> 00:43:12,618
And we will use force
if necessary.

664
00:43:14,967 --> 00:43:16,752
Force is always necessary.

665
00:43:16,795 --> 00:43:18,406
[Dr. Fate] Teth Adam.

666
00:43:18,449 --> 00:43:22,061
We know who you are
and what you are capable of.

667
00:43:22,105 --> 00:43:24,587
There's no place for you
in the world of man.

668
00:43:25,935 --> 00:43:27,198
You have two choices.

669
00:43:28,024 --> 00:43:29,634
Kneel or die.

670
00:43:31,071 --> 00:43:32,638
I was a slave until I died.

671
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:36,033
Then I was reborn a God.

672
00:43:38,296 --> 00:43:39,776
I kneel before no one.

673
00:43:43,562 --> 00:43:44,998
[grunts]

674
00:43:47,480 --> 00:43:49,177
Fate, give me a distraction.

675
00:44:31,917 --> 00:44:33,484
[people screaming]

676
00:44:42,144 --> 00:44:44,712
Just say, "Shazam."
We all go home.

677
00:44:45,234 --> 00:44:46,366
[grunts]

678
00:44:47,454 --> 00:44:48,543
I don't have a home.

Whoo!

686
00:45:22,882 --> 00:45:24,274
Look at that suit.
It's cool.

687
00:45:24,318 --> 00:45:26,146
- Thanks. You, too.
- Thank you.

688
00:45:26,189 --> 00:45:27,756
It was a hand-me-down.
It was from my uncle.

689
00:45:29,584 --> 00:45:31,586
[Teth Adam and Hawkman grunting]

690
00:45:34,634 --> 00:45:36,592
[Atom Smasher] Hawkman just
does not give up, does he?

691
00:45:36,636 --> 00:45:37,637
[Cyclone] Nope.

692
00:45:44,513 --> 00:45:45,645

Amon, where are you going?
Wait!

[Amon] To help him!

[Dr. Fate] Cyclone, Smasher,
now is your time.

699
00:46:17,591 --> 00:46:19,245
- [beeps]
- Let's roll!

700
00:46:19,289 --> 00:46:20,638
What are you doing?
Hey! Hey, hey, hey!

701
00:46:34,216 --> 00:46:36,306
[metal creaking]

702
00:46:41,093 --> 00:46:42,878
[grunts]

703
00:46:42,921 --> 00:46:44,140
[Adrianna cries out]

704
00:46:57,109 --> 00:46:58,458
[sharp yell]

705
00:46:58,502 --> 00:46:59,678
[groaning]

706
00:47:02,725 --> 00:47:03,595
No!

707
00:47:07,338 --> 00:47:08,426
[both grunting]

708
00:47:09,427 --> 00:47:10,471
I'll be right there!

709
00:47:13,649 --> 00:47:14,954
[gasps]

710
00:47:14,998 --> 00:47:17,653
[guttural roaring]

711
00:47:17,696 --> 00:47:20,047
[thunder crashing]

712
00:47:20,091 --> 00:47:21,658
You have the Crown of Sabbac.

713
00:47:24,355 --> 00:47:25,662
[loud impact]

714
00:47:38,152 --> 00:47:39,371
[Dr. Fate grunts]

715
00:47:40,546 --> 00:47:42,766
[roaring]

716
00:47:42,809 --> 00:47:44,811
[grunting]

717
00:47:50,512 --> 00:47:52,558
[all grunting]

718
00:48:05,224 --> 00:48:06,615
[Dr. Fate] I can't hold him
much longer.

719
00:48:10,315 --> 00:48:11,883
[yelling]

720
00:48:12,622 --> 00:48:13,711
Move!

721
00:48:15,103 --> 00:48:16,365
[sharp grunt]

722
00:48:32,599 --> 00:48:34,776
[crackling energy builds]

723
00:48:34,820 --> 00:48:36,822
I'm coming! I'm zeroing
in on your location!

724
00:48:36,865 --> 00:48:38,867
[booming explosion]

725
00:48:38,911 --> 00:48:40,477
[car alarms wailing]

726
00:48:40,521 --> 00:48:41,783
[frustrated growl]

727
00:48:42,828 --> 00:48:44,438
[grunting]

728
00:49:04,327 --> 00:49:06,025
- [reverberating rumble]
- [gasps]

729
00:49:07,244 --> 00:49:09,203
[crying out]

730
00:49:09,246 --> 00:49:12,293
I got him! Guys, I got him.

731
00:49:12,336 --> 00:49:15,557
It's, uh... it's me, Al. In
case you didn't recognize me.

732
00:49:15,600 --> 00:49:17,037
There's something different
about you.

733
00:49:17,080 --> 00:49:18,821
Can't quite put my finger on it.

734
00:49:18,865 --> 00:49:20,562
You know, it's probably because
I'm six stories tall now.

735
00:49:20,605 --> 00:49:22,130
But you... You're like a tornado.

736
00:49:22,173 --> 00:49:24,784
I thought the two of you
did great work.

737
00:49:24,827 --> 00:49:26,829
First time out...
[clicks teeth] Bravo.

738
00:49:26,873 --> 00:49:29,224
Thanks. I mean, I got a little
turned around back there,

739
00:49:29,267 --> 00:49:30,703
but, uh,
it all worked out, right?

740
00:49:30,747 --> 00:49:32,357
You're damn right it did.

741
00:49:32,401 --> 00:49:34,229
Let's hope Waller has
that cell ready for him.

742
00:49:34,272 --> 00:49:36,622
[powerful rumbling]

743
00:49:36,666 --> 00:49:38,059
[televisions crackling]

744
00:49:39,974 --> 00:49:42,846
[grunting] You want me
to keep my hand here, right?

745
00:49:42,890 --> 00:49:44,195
You'd better not let him up.

746
00:49:44,239 --> 00:49:45,806
[rumbling increases]

747
00:49:45,849 --> 00:49:48,634
Uh... What do I...
What do I do? Guys?

748
00:49:50,941 --> 00:49:51,986
[loud grunt]

749
00:49:52,682 --> 00:49:53,639
Whoo-hoo!

750
00:50:05,478 --> 00:50:07,872
[crowd chanting]
Long live the Champion!

751
00:50:07,916 --> 00:50:10,395
Long live the Champion!

752
00:50:10,439 --> 00:50:12,616
Long live the Champion!

753
00:50:12,659 --> 00:50:14,661
Long live the Champion!

754
00:50:14,705 --> 00:50:17,403
[chanting continues]

755
00:50:20,058 --> 00:50:22,278
[breath rumbling]

756
00:50:22,321 --> 00:50:25,542
Yeah, he's definitely
still breathing.

757
00:50:25,585 --> 00:50:30,156
Long live the Champion!
Long live the Champion!

758
00:50:30,200 --> 00:50:32,245
[chanting continues]

759
00:50:36,553 --> 00:50:38,556
[chanting subsides]

760
00:50:48,348 --> 00:50:50,307
Where are you going?
We need to go after him.

761
00:50:50,350 --> 00:50:52,004
We're not strong enough.

762
00:50:52,048 --> 00:50:54,573
Oh, well, maybe next time
use your powers of prediction

763
00:50:54,615 --> 00:50:56,966
to figure that out before
we get our asses kicked.

764
00:50:57,009 --> 00:50:58,663
I'm working on it.

765
00:50:58,706 --> 00:51:00,144
Miss?

766
00:51:00,186 --> 00:51:01,797
Excuse me, you mind
if I look in your bag?

767
00:51:01,841 --> 00:51:03,147
Yes, I do mind.

768
00:51:03,190 --> 00:51:04,670
Where are you going
with this, Kent?

769
00:51:04,713 --> 00:51:06,105
She's got the Crown of Sabbac.

770
00:51:06,149 --> 00:51:07,933
[Hawkman]
One catastrophe at a time.

771
00:51:07,977 --> 00:51:09,587
We can't give him
a chance to regroup.

772
00:51:09,630 --> 00:51:11,371
He's been spotted
entering the palace.

773
00:51:11,415 --> 00:51:13,418
It's safe to say he's not
going there to surrender.

774
00:51:13,461 --> 00:51:15,115
Why do you want
Teth Adam to surrender?

775
00:51:15,159 --> 00:51:17,335
He's the Champion of Kahndaq.
Who are you?

776
00:51:17,378 --> 00:51:19,337
The Justice Society?

777
00:51:19,380 --> 00:51:21,687
We have been living
under military occupation

778
00:51:21,730 --> 00:51:24,385
for 27 years,
and never seen you before.

779
00:51:24,429 --> 00:51:27,084
You didn't come when
Intergang invaded our country,

780
00:51:27,127 --> 00:51:29,782
when they stole our resources
and killed my husband.

781
00:51:29,825 --> 00:51:32,306
But now, we finally
have our own hero

782
00:51:32,350 --> 00:51:35,483
and you decide to fly
down here and save us?

783
00:51:35,527 --> 00:51:38,183
Thank you, but...
we're covered.

784
00:51:38,226 --> 00:51:41,969
Go and protect international
stability someplace else.

785
00:51:42,013 --> 00:51:44,406
Oh, and second,
I don't have the crown.

786
00:51:44,450 --> 00:51:46,452
Let me spell it out for you.

787
00:51:46,495 --> 00:51:48,454
Teth Adam can't be
Kahndaq's champion,

788
00:51:48,497 --> 00:51:50,151
because he is not a hero.

789
00:51:50,195 --> 00:51:52,240
Tell that...

790
00:51:52,284 --> 00:51:55,026
to all the people
he just liberated.

791
00:51:56,505 --> 00:51:58,769
I know what this looks like.
I... I do.

792
00:51:58,813 --> 00:52:00,074
But I can assure you that my t...

793
00:52:00,118 --> 00:52:01,902
- [loud crashing]
- [gasps]

794
00:52:01,946 --> 00:52:03,556
[all exclaiming]

795
00:52:03,599 --> 00:52:05,776
I am so sorry.
Was that expensive?

796
00:52:07,735 --> 00:52:10,042
Me and you. When we
get back to the ship...

797
00:52:10,085 --> 00:52:11,652
- Yes, sir.
- Me and you.

798
00:52:12,391 --> 00:52:14,437
I...

799
00:52:14,481 --> 00:52:16,178
Can we please
just see the crown?

800
00:52:16,874 --> 00:52:17,963
I don't have it.

801
00:52:24,708 --> 00:52:26,624
[indistinct chatter]

802
00:52:26,668 --> 00:52:28,103
[horns honking]

803
00:52:36,677 --> 00:52:38,157
We don't have time for this.

804
00:52:38,200 --> 00:52:40,159
Teth Adam first, then the crown.

805
00:52:40,202 --> 00:52:42,640
You don't have
any authority here.

806
00:52:42,684 --> 00:52:43,946
Teth Adam has done nothing...

807
00:52:43,990 --> 00:52:46,731
Teth Adam is not
who you think he is.

808
00:52:46,775 --> 00:52:48,255
And how would you know?

809
00:52:48,298 --> 00:52:49,865
We have access to ancient texts

810
00:52:49,908 --> 00:52:51,954
that have been kept secret
for centuries.

811
00:52:51,998 --> 00:52:54,610
And what exactly do these
supposed ancient texts say?

812
00:52:54,653 --> 00:52:57,525
They say that his rage
nearly destroyed Kahndaq.

813
00:52:58,874 --> 00:53:00,267
And we flew
all the way over here

814
00:53:00,310 --> 00:53:02,269
to stop it from happening again.

815
00:53:05,751 --> 00:53:07,144
[Hawkman] You want to
go in there alone?

816
00:53:07,188 --> 00:53:09,059
Are you sure?

817
00:53:09,103 --> 00:53:11,669
You want to go in and fight
Teth Adam again, be my guest.

818
00:53:11,713 --> 00:53:14,151
But if you actually want
to resolve things peacefully,

819
00:53:14,195 --> 00:53:16,327
without destroying
the rest of my city,

820
00:53:16,371 --> 00:53:17,502
I'm your only shot.

821
00:53:40,526 --> 00:53:42,354
[Teth Adam] You brought
the invaders with you.

822
00:53:42,398 --> 00:53:44,616
They only want to talk.

823
00:53:44,660 --> 00:53:47,794
They can talk.
I won't listen.

824
00:53:49,883 --> 00:53:52,364
When I was a little girl, my
grandmother told me the story

825
00:53:52,408 --> 00:53:55,412
of how the Champion came
to this exact spot

826
00:53:55,455 --> 00:53:57,196
to free the enslaved people
of Kahndaq

827
00:53:57,240 --> 00:53:59,372
by defeating King Ahk-Ton
in battle.

828
00:53:59,415 --> 00:54:01,417
But according
to the Justice Society,

829
00:54:01,460 --> 00:54:03,288
that's not really what happened.

830
00:54:03,332 --> 00:54:06,031
They say that you didn't
come here to seek justice.

831
00:54:08,685 --> 00:54:09,774
[King Ahk-Ton
speaking in Kahndaqi]

832
00:54:12,820 --> 00:54:14,996
[crowd exclaiming]

833
00:54:15,040 --> 00:54:17,216
[Adrianna] <i>That you came</i>
<i>to exact revenge.</i>

834
00:54:33,014 --> 00:54:34,494
<i>And in your anger...</i>

835
00:54:34,538 --> 00:54:36,106
[energy crackling]

836
00:54:36,149 --> 00:54:38,281
[speaking in Kahndaqi]

837
00:54:43,287 --> 00:54:46,638
[Adrianna] <i>...your power grew,</i>
<i>until it became uncontrollable.</i>

838
00:54:46,681 --> 00:54:48,205
[people screaming]

839
00:54:54,036 --> 00:54:56,952
And the Council of Wizards
was forced to deem you unworthy

840
00:54:56,996 --> 00:54:58,433
of the gifts that
you were granted.

841
00:54:59,390 --> 00:55:01,305
[speaking in Kahndaqi]

842
00:55:18,236 --> 00:55:19,802
[energy building]

843
00:55:20,499 --> 00:55:22,153
[screaming]

844
00:55:26,853 --> 00:55:29,203
It wasn't your tomb
that I opened, was it?

845
00:55:32,554 --> 00:55:33,947
It was your prison.

846
00:55:35,514 --> 00:55:38,213
And, now, there's
a statue of you.

847
00:55:38,257 --> 00:55:41,999
Out of the hope that someday
Kahndaq's champion would return.

848
00:55:42,043 --> 00:55:43,697
But it's built on a lie,
isn't it?

849
00:55:43,740 --> 00:55:45,786
[Teth Adam] I never
said I was a hero.

850
00:55:45,829 --> 00:55:48,049
I never claimed to be anything.

851
00:55:48,092 --> 00:55:50,617
You may not have been a hero.

852
00:55:50,660 --> 00:55:53,185
But that doesn't mean
that you can't be one now.

853
00:56:00,670 --> 00:56:02,237
I will hear them out.

854
00:56:02,281 --> 00:56:04,414
But if they choose to fight,
they choose to die.

855
00:56:07,373 --> 00:56:09,331
[door unlocks, opens]

856
00:56:10,377 --> 00:56:12,205
Uncle Karim!

857
00:56:12,248 --> 00:56:13,467
I can't believe you're
sitting around watching TV

858
00:56:13,510 --> 00:56:14,903
when the most epic day ever is...

859
00:56:14,946 --> 00:56:17,210
- [Ishmael] In here, little man.
- [gasps]

860
00:56:19,168 --> 00:56:21,301
Ishmael! My mom said
you got buried in the tomb.

861
00:56:21,344 --> 00:56:22,867
Funny story, he didn't.

862
00:56:22,911 --> 00:56:24,956
- [laughs]
- Where's Adrianna?

863
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:26,262
She's back at the square...

864
00:56:26,306 --> 00:56:27,481
We should go bail her out
right now.

865
00:56:27,524 --> 00:56:28,656
But she's the one
who sent me home

866
00:56:28,700 --> 00:56:29,918
to make sure the crown's safe.

867
00:56:29,961 --> 00:56:31,615
It is safe, okay?
Somewhere else.

868
00:56:31,659 --> 00:56:34,140
- Definitely not here. Let...
- Okay...

869
00:56:34,184 --> 00:56:35,576
- Put the bag down.
- What are you doing?

870
00:56:35,619 --> 00:56:38,144
Back away.
Put the bag down, now.

871
00:56:41,713 --> 00:56:42,888
Give him the bag.
Give him the bag.

872
00:56:43,888 --> 00:56:44,977
[crown clanking]

873
00:56:45,021 --> 00:56:46,152
Very good. Back away.

874
00:56:47,415 --> 00:56:49,112
- Back away.
- Okay, I'm...

875
00:56:52,246 --> 00:56:53,769
[bag unzips]

876
00:56:59,078 --> 00:57:01,298
[Ishmael] It's all going
to be okay, little man.

877
00:57:01,342 --> 00:57:03,562
Let me teach you some
history that you've never learned

878
00:57:03,606 --> 00:57:04,954
in one of your mother's classes.

879
00:57:04,997 --> 00:57:06,695
When we had a powerful king,

880
00:57:06,738 --> 00:57:10,307
Kahndaq used to be something
much better than free.

881
00:57:10,351 --> 00:57:11,700
It used to be great.

882
00:57:11,743 --> 00:57:13,311
Run, Amon, run!

883
00:57:13,355 --> 00:57:15,573
[both men grunting]

884
00:57:17,140 --> 00:57:19,098
- [gunshot]
- [Karim grunts loudly]

885
00:57:19,752 --> 00:57:21,841
[panting]

886
00:57:26,759 --> 00:57:28,370
[loud grunt]

887
00:57:32,069 --> 00:57:33,289
Crash the building.

888
00:57:33,332 --> 00:57:34,637
I lost the kid.
He has the crown.

889
00:57:51,089 --> 00:57:53,091
[Hawkman] We're here
to negotiate the terms

890
00:57:53,134 --> 00:57:55,528
of your peaceful surrender.

891
00:57:55,572 --> 00:57:59,097
I'm not peaceful.
Nor do I surrender.

892
00:57:59,140 --> 00:58:01,318
[Dr. Fate] What have your
powers ever given to you?

893
00:58:01,361 --> 00:58:03,362
Nothing but heartache.

894
00:58:03,406 --> 00:58:04,886
You have no idea.

895
00:58:04,930 --> 00:58:06,584
Then why are you
making this hard on us?

896
00:58:06,627 --> 00:58:08,933
We both know you're
not supposed to be here.

897
00:58:08,976 --> 00:58:11,457
It is you who is not
supposed to be here.

898
00:58:11,501 --> 00:58:14,113
I want you all to leave
Kahndaq and never return.

899
00:58:14,156 --> 00:58:18,030
Gladly,
with you as our prisoner.

900
00:58:18,072 --> 00:58:20,641
How 'bout I rip your
little wings off instead?

901
00:58:20,685 --> 00:58:22,295
I'd like to see you try.

902
00:58:22,339 --> 00:58:23,992
Okay, more fighting
won't solve this.

903
00:58:24,036 --> 00:58:25,385
- I disagree.
- Me, too.

904
00:58:25,429 --> 00:58:27,039
Looks like we found
common ground.

905
00:58:27,082 --> 00:58:28,780
This can only end one way.

906
00:58:28,823 --> 00:58:30,390
[cell phone buzzing]

907
00:58:30,434 --> 00:58:31,913
- [Amon] <i>Mom?</i>
- Amon.

908
00:58:31,957 --> 00:58:33,785
I got home and Ishmael
was in the kitchen.

909
00:58:33,828 --> 00:58:35,308
Ishmael's dead.

910
00:58:35,352 --> 00:58:37,136
No, he shot Uncle Karim,
and he's after the crown.

911
00:58:37,179 --> 00:58:38,572
[terse chatter]

912
00:58:38,616 --> 00:58:40,269
[female soldier]
Ground forces...

913
00:58:40,313 --> 00:58:42,228
I'm hiding in our building,
and Intergang's here.

914
00:58:42,271 --> 00:58:44,099
They're coming!

915
00:58:44,143 --> 00:58:46,319
Intergang are after my son.

916
00:58:46,364 --> 00:58:49,410
They don't want him, they
want the Crown of Sabbac.

917
00:58:49,454 --> 00:58:50,716
I know you're not a hero.

918
00:58:50,759 --> 00:58:52,021
But you're not a monster,
either.

919
00:58:52,065 --> 00:58:53,545
I don't care what anyone says.

920
00:58:53,588 --> 00:58:55,634
You saved me in that cave.

921
00:58:55,677 --> 00:58:58,594
You didn't know me and your
first instinct was to save me.

922
00:58:58,638 --> 00:59:01,335
I'm begging you.
Please, save my son.

923
00:59:05,819 --> 00:59:07,254
[soldier] Check
the whole place clean.

924
00:59:07,298 --> 00:59:09,344
[soldier 2]
Cover all access points!

925
00:59:09,388 --> 00:59:11,780
- Keep looking!
- [indistinct radio chatter]

926
00:59:19,309 --> 00:59:20,616

927
00:59:21,574 --> 00:59:23,227
There! Take him!

928
00:59:23,271 --> 00:59:24,446

Right there, right there!

929

930
00:59:27,536 --> 00:59:28,885
Move, move!

931
00:59:28,929 --> 00:59:30,409
Don't shoot him, I need him!

932
00:59:31,759 --> 00:59:34,064

936
00:59:39,983 --> 00:59:41,768
[soldier 5] He's going down,
he's going down!

937
00:59:42,552 --> 00:59:43,901
[Amon grunts]

938

940

[flybike pilot]
End of the road, kid!

941
00:59:53,911 --> 00:59:55,086
[soldiers shouting]

942
00:59:58,525 --> 00:59:59,830
Release the child.

943
00:59:59,874 --> 01:00:01,354
- Whatever you say.
- [Amon yelling]

944
01:00:01,398 --> 01:00:03,356
- [yelling]
- [Teth Adam grunts]

945
01:00:04,444 --> 01:00:06,315
Yes! Thank you!

946
01:00:06,358 --> 01:00:08,666
But maybe be more careful
with your word choice next time.

947
01:00:10,885 --> 01:00:12,278
[men screaming]

948
01:00:12,322 --> 01:00:14,367
Oh! And remember
your catchphrase!

- [gunfire]
- [men screaming]

950
01:00:19,329 --> 01:00:20,548
Time to go, Amon.

951
01:00:22,288 --> 01:00:24,377
[gunfire continues]

952
01:00:28,425 --> 01:00:30,122
- Where's the crown?
- What crown?

953
01:00:30,166 --> 01:00:32,691
- You want to be brave, eh?
- I want you to go to hell.

954
01:00:32,735 --> 01:00:34,170
That's the plan, little man.

955
01:00:34,213 --> 01:00:35,998
We're gonna go for a ride.
Come on.

956

Put me down! Put me down!

959
01:00:52,885 --> 01:00:54,974
You should really be more careful
with your word choice next time.

960
01:00:55,018 --> 01:00:56,628
[screaming] - And tell
them that the Man in Black...

[horn blaring]

He's right behind me.
Where the hell is everybody?

964
01:01:15,865 --> 01:01:17,171
Mom?

965
01:01:17,215 --> 01:01:20,044
Amon, where are you?
No, no, no. What?

966
01:01:20,087 --> 01:01:21,785
I'm in one of their bikes.

967
01:01:21,828 --> 01:01:22,959
What bikes?

Can you hear me?

973
01:01:44,243 --> 01:01:45,417
<i>Mom, I'm okay.</i>

974
01:01:52,467 --> 01:01:53,469
Shit!

975
01:01:59,650 --> 01:02:00,912
Activate infrared.

Searching for the child.

979
01:02:09,529 --> 01:02:10,878
No, you're murdering people.

980
01:02:10,922 --> 01:02:12,620
How else do I find the child?

981
01:02:12,664 --> 01:02:14,839
I can help you, but no more
extrajudicial killings.

982
01:02:14,882 --> 01:02:16,667

- Come on, let's go!
- Uh, okay.

987
01:02:24,109 --> 01:02:26,242
Okay. I got this. I got this.
On the count of three.

One, two...

than last time.

How bad is it, Doc?
Am I dying?

1013

I'm not that kind of doctor.

But don't worry,
I can see the future.

This isn't how you're
going to die.

How do I die, then?

1017
01:04:23,799 --> 01:04:25,626
Just stay away from electricity.

1018
01:04:25,670 --> 01:04:28,629
Wait, what?
I'm an electrician.

1019

01:06:38,807 --> 01:06:40,940
The nanobots did
most of the work.

1053
01:06:40,983 --> 01:06:43,246
No, no, no. I'm not gonna
let you downplay this.

1054
01:06:43,290 --> 01:06:45,248
I literally just witnessed
a miracle.

1055
01:06:45,292 --> 01:06:46,728
Mm-mm. [chuckles]

1056
01:06:46,771 --> 01:06:48,469
What? I say something stupid?

1057
01:06:48,512 --> 01:06:51,516
No, it's just you can transform
your molecular structure,

1058
01:06:51,560 --> 01:06:53,301
grow a hundred times
your own size.

1059
01:06:53,344 --> 01:06:55,519
You're an impossibility
and the world still amazes you.

1060
01:06:55,563 --> 01:06:57,044
- [chuckles]
- I don't know, it's...

1061
01:06:58,001 --> 01:06:59,089
It's cool.

1062
01:07:00,351 --> 01:07:02,223
Thank you.

1063
01:07:02,266 --> 01:07:03,746
But it's not as cool
as nanobots.

1064
01:07:06,009 --> 01:07:08,230
That's how you do
your wind thing.

1065
01:07:08,273 --> 01:07:10,840
Well, the "wind thing"
is called aerokinesis.

1066
01:07:10,884 --> 01:07:12,886
And the nanobots were injected
into my bloodstream

1067
01:07:12,929 --> 01:07:14,322
by this really
messed-up scientist

1068
01:07:14,365 --> 01:07:15,889
who kidnapped me when I was 15.

1069
01:07:20,110 --> 01:07:21,546
I'm... so sorry.

1070
01:07:22,679 --> 01:07:24,115
No, you're good.

1071
01:07:24,159 --> 01:07:26,161
It seems like you
really turned it around.

1072
01:07:26,204 --> 01:07:27,379
Found your calling.

1073
01:07:28,684 --> 01:07:29,860
Hoping this is mine.

1074
01:07:31,688 --> 01:07:33,429
[crying softly]

1075
01:07:36,214 --> 01:07:38,260
[Dr. Fate] There's no point
in dwelling in the past.

1076
01:07:41,002 --> 01:07:42,699
It's already moved on from you.

1077
01:07:46,965 --> 01:07:48,445
Why did you say that?

1078
01:07:48,488 --> 01:07:51,012
You were blaming yourself
for trusting Ishmael.

1079
01:07:51,055 --> 01:07:54,233
Your thoughts are better spent
on the things you can change,

1080
01:07:54,277 --> 01:07:55,495
not those you can't.

1081
01:07:56,800 --> 01:07:58,628
[whispering] You see the future?

1082
01:07:58,671 --> 01:08:00,544
Tell me how I get my son back.

1083
01:08:01,893 --> 01:08:03,242
By trusting us.

1084
01:08:03,286 --> 01:08:05,766
Karim will live.
We will save Amon.

1085
01:08:06,550 --> 01:08:07,638
It's what we do.

1086
01:08:12,949 --> 01:08:15,733
I suppose they didn't
have doors in your day.

1087
01:08:15,776 --> 01:08:18,605
Well, of course we did.
That's how we entered rooms.

1088
01:08:18,649 --> 01:08:20,999
What I did there
is called sarcasm.

1089
01:08:21,043 --> 01:08:23,088
Where is Amon?
Did you find him?

1090
01:08:23,132 --> 01:08:24,394
Not yet, but I will.

1091
01:08:24,437 --> 01:08:25,526
The men who took him
will suffer.

1092
01:08:25,570 --> 01:08:27,354
[soldiers grunting]

1093
01:08:27,398 --> 01:08:28,660
Maybe these guys can help.

1094
01:08:30,705 --> 01:08:33,099
There's an upside
to keeping prisoners.

1095
01:08:33,143 --> 01:08:35,014
They can answer our questions.

1096
01:08:35,058 --> 01:08:36,581
What did you do with my son?

1097
01:08:36,624 --> 01:08:38,626
[soldier grunting in pain]

1098
01:08:40,889 --> 01:08:45,068
- [blows landing]
- [men grunting]

1099
01:08:45,111 --> 01:08:47,767
- Adrianna. Adrianna.
- [panting]

1100
01:08:47,810 --> 01:08:49,464
I've learned that
in this modern world,

1101
01:08:49,508 --> 01:08:50,987
we shouldn't hurt our prisoners.

1102
01:08:51,031 --> 01:08:52,510
We should treat them
with dignity, respect.

1103
01:08:53,990 --> 01:08:56,035
[Adrianna] No.

1104
01:08:56,079 --> 01:08:58,386
Let's start with just
one simple question.

1105
01:08:58,430 --> 01:09:00,867
- Can either of you fly?
- [both gasp]

1106
01:09:00,910 --> 01:09:02,129
- [screaming]
- Shit.

1107
01:09:04,349 --> 01:09:05,611
I think I'll sit this one out.

1108
01:09:06,786 --> 01:09:09,267
[soldiers screaming]

1109
01:09:09,310 --> 01:09:11,182
[thunder crashing]

1110
01:09:12,922 --> 01:09:14,098
Tell me what you did with Amon.

1111
01:09:16,100 --> 01:09:17,971
You'd better not drop
those prisoners.

1112
01:09:18,015 --> 01:09:19,538
I'm not going to drop them.

1113
01:09:21,453 --> 01:09:23,064
I'm going to drop one of them.

1114
01:09:23,108 --> 01:09:25,500
Whoever answers first lives.
Where is he?

1115
01:09:25,544 --> 01:09:26,546
I don't know.

1116
01:09:26,589 --> 01:09:28,417
[screaming]

1117
01:09:33,509 --> 01:09:35,207
He's at our mine in the desert.

1118
01:09:35,250 --> 01:09:36,686
I can show... [screaming]

1119
01:09:38,340 --> 01:09:40,516
- [Hawkman grunts]
- [gasping in fear]

1120
01:09:40,560 --> 01:09:42,301
[second soldier screaming
in distance]

1121
01:09:42,344 --> 01:09:43,911
Oh, you gotta be kidding me.

1122
01:09:46,305 --> 01:09:48,133
You said you wouldn't
hurt the prisoners.

1123
01:09:48,176 --> 01:09:50,048
That was sarcasm.

1124
01:09:50,091 --> 01:09:52,181
No, technically,
it was just a lie.

1125
01:09:52,225 --> 01:09:53,616
Intergang have a mine
in the desert.

1126
01:09:53,660 --> 01:09:55,053
- Amon is there.
- I know it.

1127
01:09:55,096 --> 01:09:57,142
It's near
the Al Hadidiyah Mountains.

1128
01:09:57,185 --> 01:09:58,231
Let's go.

1129
01:09:58,274 --> 01:09:59,841
[soldiers screaming, grunting]

1130
01:09:59,884 --> 01:10:02,147
I told you, stop killing people!

1131
01:10:02,190 --> 01:10:03,453
They look alive to me.

1132
01:10:03,497 --> 01:10:05,107
Because I saved them.

1133
01:10:05,151 --> 01:10:06,804
Well, that's why I waited
until you were there.

1134
01:10:06,848 --> 01:10:08,937
I got the information I needed,
no one died.

1135
01:10:09,938 --> 01:10:10,982
I did it your way.

1136
01:10:11,026 --> 01:10:12,332
He does have a point.

1137
01:10:13,855 --> 01:10:15,770
I know it got lost
in all the confusion,

1138
01:10:15,813 --> 01:10:18,165
but we still have some issues
to settle here.

1139
01:10:18,208 --> 01:10:20,167
We know where Amon is.
We have to go.

1140
01:10:20,210 --> 01:10:21,907
There is no "we" here.

1141
01:10:21,951 --> 01:10:24,996
There are only heroes
and there are villains.

1142
01:10:26,128 --> 01:10:27,783
You think yourself a hero,

1143
01:10:27,826 --> 01:10:29,567
but you would let these
criminals go free,

1144
01:10:29,611 --> 01:10:31,526
knowing that many more
will suffer at their hands

1145
01:10:31,569 --> 01:10:33,005
unless we end them now.

1146
01:10:33,049 --> 01:10:35,095
Heroes don't kill people.

1147
01:10:39,186 --> 01:10:40,187
Well, I do.

1148
01:10:42,189 --> 01:10:43,146
Here we go.

1149
01:10:43,190 --> 01:10:45,540
[both grunting]

1150
01:10:57,248 --> 01:10:58,380
[sharp grunt]

1151
01:11:00,295 --> 01:11:01,599
[yells]

1152
01:11:04,647 --> 01:11:06,649
[yelling]

1153
01:11:17,921 --> 01:11:20,576
[Hawkman yells, grunts]

1154
01:11:28,672 --> 01:11:30,282
[yelling]

1155
01:11:32,415 --> 01:11:34,112
[Teth Adam grunts in pain]

1156
01:11:44,209 --> 01:11:45,645
Is that what I think it is?

1157
01:11:47,517 --> 01:11:49,214
[Hawkman] Twenty-three
pounds of pure Eternium,

1158
01:11:49,258 --> 01:11:52,086
much denser than typical
artifacts of the period.

1159
01:11:52,130 --> 01:11:53,610
King must have had
a really strong neck.

1160
01:11:53,653 --> 01:11:55,481
No, it snapped
when I killed him.

1161
01:11:57,615 --> 01:11:59,093
What's that?

1162
01:11:59,137 --> 01:12:00,834
There's writing on the inside
of the rim.

1163
01:12:00,878 --> 01:12:02,881
"Life is the only path
to death."

1164
01:12:03,925 --> 01:12:05,188
That's what it says.

1165
01:12:05,231 --> 01:12:08,321
Life is the only path to death.

1166
01:12:08,365 --> 01:12:11,585
Well, that's
surprisingly obvious.

1167
01:12:11,629 --> 01:12:13,283
Could it have another meaning?

1168
01:12:13,326 --> 01:12:15,372
What if it means, like, um...

1169
01:12:15,415 --> 01:12:17,591
"Life is short.

1170
01:12:17,635 --> 01:12:19,027
You gotta hold on
to what you love."

1171
01:12:21,160 --> 01:12:22,509
Stop.

1172
01:12:22,553 --> 01:12:23,729
Deep.

1173
01:12:23,772 --> 01:12:25,383
It doesn't matter what it means.

1174
01:12:25,426 --> 01:12:27,428
It should be buried
under the ocean for eternity.

1175
01:12:27,472 --> 01:12:30,474
That's not far from what we had
in mind for you when this is over.

1176
01:12:30,517 --> 01:12:31,823
Or I could bury you with it.

1177
01:12:33,825 --> 01:12:35,479
We can't get rid of it now.

1178
01:12:35,522 --> 01:12:37,699
It's the one thing
that Intergang wants.

1179
01:12:37,743 --> 01:12:39,875
Believe me,
I know more than anyone

1180
01:12:39,919 --> 01:12:41,399
what this crown is capable of.

1181
01:12:41,442 --> 01:12:44,706
But we have to keep it
until my son is safe.

1182
01:12:44,750 --> 01:12:46,012
Adrianna...

1183
01:12:46,055 --> 01:12:48,058
Trust me,
we will get your son back.

1184
01:12:48,102 --> 01:12:50,582
They don't care about him.
They just want to defeat me.

1185
01:12:50,625 --> 01:12:51,714
Hand it over.

1186
01:12:53,716 --> 01:12:57,024
We can't risk letting the crown
fall into the wrong hands.

1187
01:12:58,547 --> 01:13:00,288
We'll find another way.

1188
01:13:01,593 --> 01:13:03,421
No.

1189
01:13:03,464 --> 01:13:06,163
You like to split the world
into good and bad,

1190
01:13:06,207 --> 01:13:09,471
but that's easy to do when
you're the one drawing the line.

1191
01:13:09,515 --> 01:13:11,604
All I care about is Amon.

1192
01:13:11,647 --> 01:13:15,825
And until he is safe,
we're all on the same side.

1193
01:13:15,869 --> 01:13:19,176
And you...
you will work together.

1194
01:13:26,359 --> 01:13:29,099
Set a course
for the Al Hadidiyah Mountains.

1195
01:13:29,143 --> 01:13:30,580
We'll go in at dawn.

1196
01:13:32,147 --> 01:13:34,280
I hope you can be a team player.

1197
01:13:34,323 --> 01:13:36,194
I love teams.

1198
01:13:36,238 --> 01:13:37,674
That was sarcasm again, yes?

1199
01:13:37,718 --> 01:13:39,197
Very much so.

1200
01:13:39,241 --> 01:13:41,156
Good. Just checking.

1201
01:13:51,862 --> 01:13:54,082
A wise man
once told me a bad plan

1202
01:13:54,125 --> 01:13:55,562
is better than no plan at all.

1203
01:13:55,605 --> 01:13:58,392
That was before we had
a very bad plan.

1204
01:13:59,130 --> 01:14:01,045
Let it go.

1205
01:14:01,089 --> 01:14:03,571
I'd rather be fighting with him
than against him.

1206
01:14:03,614 --> 01:14:05,399
He's a murderer, Kent.

1207
01:14:05,442 --> 01:14:08,924
If he turns on us,
that kid is as good as dead.

1208
01:14:08,967 --> 01:14:11,621
You don't get to decide
who lives or dies.

1209
01:14:13,189 --> 01:14:15,322
That's... up to Fate.

1210
01:14:15,365 --> 01:14:16,845
What's the helmet telling you?

1211
01:14:17,933 --> 01:14:20,502
Somebody's gonna die.

1212
01:14:20,545 --> 01:14:23,286
Who is it? Atom Smasher?
It's Atom Smasher.

1213
01:14:23,330 --> 01:14:24,548
Surprisingly, no.

1214
01:14:25,768 --> 01:14:26,768
Is it me?

1215
01:14:29,772 --> 01:14:30,816
[intense scream]

1216
01:14:33,079 --> 01:14:36,474
When it's time for you and I
to say goodbye, you'll know.

1217
01:14:39,302 --> 01:14:40,739
All I can tell you is...

1218
01:14:43,001 --> 01:14:45,309
there's still time
to change the future.

1219
01:14:46,484 --> 01:14:47,790
Let's use it.

1220
01:14:48,486 --> 01:14:49,531
Hmm.

1221
01:14:53,273 --> 01:14:55,885
Well, I guess we're sticking
with the very bad plan.

1222
01:15:08,464 --> 01:15:09,856
[Hawkman]
<i>The Al Hadidiyah Mine</i>

1223
01:15:09,900 --> 01:15:12,076
<i>is Intergang's
most valued asset.</i>

01:29:12,377 --> 01:29:14,031
[pained exhale]

1398
01:29:15,989 --> 01:29:17,252
[Dr. Fate moans]

1399
01:29:19,471 --> 01:29:20,430
Kent.

1400
01:29:22,170 --> 01:29:23,476
- Kent!
- [gasps]

1401
01:29:26,610 --> 01:29:28,001
Mission accomplished?

1402
01:29:28,045 --> 01:29:30,178
My vision hasn't changed.

1403
01:29:30,222 --> 01:29:32,398
But Teth Adam's
out of the equation.

1404
01:29:32,442 --> 01:29:35,315
Kent, if this isn't over, I
need to know what's coming.

1405
01:29:35,358 --> 01:29:36,881
What is the helmet telling you?

1406
01:29:38,448 --> 01:29:41,799
My vision has always
shown me a great calamity.

1407
01:29:41,842 --> 01:29:43,932
The world in flames.

1408
01:29:43,976 --> 01:29:45,193
We can stop it...

1409
01:29:47,108 --> 01:29:48,327
but you die.

1410
01:29:50,590 --> 01:29:51,897
You should've told me sooner.

1411
01:29:55,248 --> 01:29:57,163
I have no fear of death.

1412
01:29:57,206 --> 01:29:59,382
That's precisely
why I didn't tell you.

1413
01:29:59,425 --> 01:30:01,602
The world needs
the Justice Society.

1414
01:30:01,646 --> 01:30:03,561
The world needs you.

1415
01:30:03,604 --> 01:30:05,693
But you can't choose
who lives and dies.

1416
01:30:06,565 --> 01:30:07,608
That's Fate, right?

1417
01:30:08,696 --> 01:30:10,916
[rueful chuckle]

1418
01:30:10,959 --> 01:30:12,439
That sounds familiar.

1419
01:30:15,313 --> 01:30:17,227
I remember seeing
my first airplane.

1420
01:30:19,099 --> 01:30:23,972
It was an RAF deployment,
headed to the Western Front.

1421
01:30:24,017 --> 01:30:26,280
Everyone on my street
came out to see them off.

1422
01:30:26,846 --> 01:30:28,587
Mm.

1423
01:30:28,630 --> 01:30:29,892
But I didn't cheer.

1424
01:30:31,764 --> 01:30:34,419
Even though I was only a boy.

1425
01:30:34,462 --> 01:30:39,075
I knew where they were headed,
and what awaited them.

1426
01:30:39,119 --> 01:30:40,642
Thanks to this,
I've lived longer

1427
01:30:40,686 --> 01:30:42,862
than I could've
ever have hoped for.

1428
01:30:42,905 --> 01:30:44,559
I've seen the world change

1429
01:30:44,603 --> 01:30:46,474
in more ways
than I could've imagined.

1430
01:30:49,912 --> 01:30:51,479
I'm still a sentimental fool.

1431
01:30:53,263 --> 01:30:54,917
And I don't want
my friend to die.

1432
01:30:57,704 --> 01:30:59,053
[sighs]

1433
01:31:03,187 --> 01:31:08,018
Ishmael said, "Death
is the only path to life."

1434
01:31:08,062 --> 01:31:10,412
But that's not
what the inscription says.

1435
01:31:10,456 --> 01:31:12,762
Right. "Life is the only
path to death."

1436
01:31:13,850 --> 01:31:15,330
Maybe he got it backwards,

1437
01:31:15,374 --> 01:31:17,637
like he read it in a mirror
or something.

1438
01:31:17,680 --> 01:31:19,247
That's it.

1439
01:31:19,290 --> 01:31:21,555
In Kahndaqi mythology,
the souls of the damned

1440
01:31:21,598 --> 01:31:23,687
are sent
to the Rock of Finality.

1441
01:31:23,731 --> 01:31:25,820
The underworld
is a mirror to our own.

1442
01:31:25,863 --> 01:31:27,648
Here, turn the crown around.

1443
01:31:29,040 --> 01:31:30,738
Now mirror the letters.

1444
01:31:30,781 --> 01:31:33,871
See? That's what I missed.

1445
01:31:33,915 --> 01:31:37,397
"Death is the only
path to life."

1446
01:31:40,138 --> 01:31:41,705
[gasping]

1447
01:31:41,749 --> 01:31:44,230
[Adrianna] <i>He kidnapped Amon</i>
<i>on purpose,</i>

1448
01:31:44,274 --> 01:31:46,710
<i>because he knew
that Teth Adam would kill him.</i>

1449
01:31:46,754 --> 01:31:48,799
<i>And he believed
the Champion's magic</i>

1450
01:31:48,843 --> 01:31:50,714
<i>would send him
to the Rock of Finality.</i>

1451
01:31:50,758 --> 01:31:54,589
As life is the path to death.

1452
01:31:54,632 --> 01:31:58,288
[demon 1] Now your death
is a path to life.

1453
01:31:58,331 --> 01:32:00,377
[demon 2] The wizards
have their champion,

1454
01:32:00,421 --> 01:32:02,597
now we have ours.

1455
01:32:02,640 --> 01:32:05,469
[demon 3] You will take
the throne of Kahndaq

1456
01:32:05,513 --> 01:32:09,517
and unleash hell on Earth!

1457
01:32:09,560 --> 01:32:11,432
[demons] Speak our name.

1458
01:32:12,303 --> 01:32:13,434
"Sabbac."

1459
01:32:14,783 --> 01:32:18,047
[screaming]

1460
01:32:34,847 --> 01:32:36,719
[Dr. Fate] What
the bloody hell is that?

1461
01:32:36,762 --> 01:32:38,677
[Hawkman] Readout says
it's the demon, Sabbac.

1462
01:32:38,721 --> 01:32:40,723
Get me closer.
Now, right now!

1463
01:32:40,766 --> 01:32:42,376
We're 100 miles out,
give me 20 seconds!

1464
01:32:50,429 --> 01:32:52,475
[speaking in Kahndaqi]

1465
01:32:58,132 --> 01:32:59,482
Brace yourselves!

1466
01:33:02,353 --> 01:33:03,964
[roaring]

1467
01:33:04,008 --> 01:33:05,313
[all yelling]

1468
01:33:05,357 --> 01:33:06,793
Hold on!

01:33:06,837 --> 01:33:08,360

[scattered shouts, yelling]

1476
01:33:43,439 --> 01:33:45,354
[Sabbac in English]
Now prepare to die.

1477
01:33:45,398 --> 01:33:46,487

1478
01:33:48,532 --> 01:33:50,882
[both grunt]

1479
01:33:50,925 --> 01:33:52,274
Wait, wait, where's Uncle Karim?

[Atom Smasher coughing]

1481
01:33:58,499 --> 01:34:00,545

[grunts]

1484
01:34:09,249 --> 01:34:12,208
[Hawkman] No matter what
happens, he does not sit on that throne.

1485
01:34:15,560 --> 01:34:17,213
- [Atom Smasher] Copy that.
- [Cyclone] We're on it!

1486
01:34:17,257 --> 01:34:18,301
Heads up!

Sabbac, show yourself!

- [people yelling]
- Adrianna! Amon!

1498

[Sabbac yells]

1499
01:35:19,408 --> 01:35:20,975
That's for my cruiser.

01:35:59,450 --> 01:36:00,669
[Dr. Fate] This is it.

1508
01:36:01,930 --> 01:36:03,627
We can't win, Carter.

1509
01:36:03,671 --> 01:36:06,675
Yeah, but the world burns
if we don't. Right?

1510
01:36:09,199 --> 01:36:11,331
Bad plan is better than
no plan at all.

No, no, no.
What are you doing?

1515
01:36:40,405 --> 01:36:42,102
Giving us a third option.

1516
01:36:42,146 --> 01:36:43,625
It's supposed to be me.

1517
01:36:43,669 --> 01:36:45,803
I didn't tell you
my whole vision, old friend.

1518
01:36:46,803 --> 01:36:48,326
I did see your death.

1519
01:36:48,369 --> 01:36:50,807
But I also found a way
to prevent it.

1520
01:36:50,851 --> 01:36:52,897
It has been
an extraordinary life,

1521
01:36:52,940 --> 01:36:55,550
but always with one foot
in the future.

1522
01:36:55,594 --> 01:36:58,729
Carter, for the first time
in 100 years,

1523
01:36:58,771 --> 01:36:59,947
when I look ahead...

1524
01:37:02,514 --> 01:37:03,864
I see nothing.

1525
01:37:03,908 --> 01:37:04,822
No, Kent.

1526
01:37:04,865 --> 01:37:05,779
And...

1527
01:37:06,867 --> 01:37:07,912
it's...

1528
01:37:08,826 --> 01:37:09,913
beautiful.

1529
01:37:09,956 --> 01:37:11,045
Wait, Kent!

1530
01:37:11,089 --> 01:37:12,133
Goodbye...

1531
01:37:12,177 --> 01:37:13,831
Kent! [grunting loudly]

1532
01:37:13,874 --> 01:37:15,006

Kent! [grunts]

[growling]

1539
01:37:48,083 --> 01:37:53,132
I am Dr. Fate, sorcerer,
agent of the Lords of Order,

1540
01:37:53,175 --> 01:37:56,309
defender against darkness
and chaos,

1541
01:37:56,352 --> 01:37:59,008
but even my powers
cannot defeat you.

Teth Adam.

1547
01:38:22,684 --> 01:38:24,164
I know you can hear me.

[Dr. Fate] <i>You have the power</i>

[Dr. Fate] <i>You believe you
