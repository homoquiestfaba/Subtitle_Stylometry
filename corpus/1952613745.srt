Woof, woof !

00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:47,132
            Do I smell          
            some dinner ?!

11
00:02:49,736 --> 00:02:51,503
                I knew that.    

12
00:02:51,571 --> 00:02:53,972
You've been up                  
all night again, huh ?          

13
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:56,108
                Sorry,          
                it's just that  

14
00:02:56,176 --> 00:02:58,744
            I've been working   
            on this Melody      

15
00:02:58,811 --> 00:03:02,814
    And it's somewhere in there.
    I just can't find it.       

16
00:03:05,818 --> 00:03:07,452
            What's this ?       

17
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:08,954
Breakfast burrito.              

18
00:03:09,022 --> 00:03:10,556
                Cool, thanks.   

19
00:03:10,623 --> 00:03:13,192
                Let me see      
                your face.      

20
00:03:13,259 --> 00:03:15,994
                Excellent, b+.  

21
00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:20,632
            So, what's in       
            this burrito ?      

22
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:23,335
Eggs, refried beans,            
onions, jalapeños,              

23
00:03:23,403 --> 00:03:26,538
Peanut butter,                  
mozzarella cheese,              
pineapple chunks.               

24
00:03:26,606 --> 00:03:27,806
Oh, yeah,                       
and lettuce.                    

25
00:03:27,874 --> 00:03:29,875
So it's nutritionally           
balanced.                       

26
00:03:29,943 --> 00:03:32,477
Oh, shoot !

33
00:04:00,607 --> 00:04:02,541

another one.                    

34
00:04:15,188 --> 00:04:16,255
                Woof !

39
00:04:29,002 --> 00:04:31,103
I'm not in the mood for         
the principal calling me        

40
00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:32,904
    Telling me

    What is that ?              

43
00:04:42,048 --> 00:04:43,081
    Lovely.

56
00:05:54,787 --> 00:05:57,456
Pfft...                         

57
00:05:57,523 --> 00:05:59,825
                I'm so sorry.   

58
00:06:01,594 --> 00:06:02,394
                Let me help.    

59
00:06:02,462 --> 00:06:04,863
No, that's okay.                

60
00:06:04,931 --> 00:06:06,765
        Oh, jeez.               

61
00:06:06,833 --> 00:06:09,201
Here, let me help.              

62
00:06:09,268 --> 00:06:11,269
        Just how do you         
        propose to do that ?    

63
00:06:11,337 --> 00:06:14,306
I'll put your flowers           
back in the ground here.        

64
00:06:14,374 --> 00:06:17,509
    Wait, wait, no.             

65
00:06:17,577 --> 00:06:20,579
Actually, I have a very         
particular way of doing this.   

66
00:06:20,646 --> 00:06:23,582
I like to put the roots         
in the ground.                  

67
00:06:23,649 --> 00:06:26,351
                     <i>Oh...</i>

00:06:26,419 --> 00:06:28,320
                    Very...     

69
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:30,021
You new in                      
the neighborhood ?              

70
00:06:30,089 --> 00:06:31,256
                    Yeah.       

71
00:06:32,725 --> 00:06:35,127
        Just renting            
        for the week ?          

72
00:06:35,194 --> 00:06:37,896
Actually we'll be here          
'till the end of July.          

73
00:06:40,833 --> 00:06:42,267
            Great !             

74
00:06:42,335 --> 00:06:44,503
I'm Terry Barnett.

77
00:06:50,943 --> 00:06:53,044
                    Right.      

78
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:56,415
I'd love to stay and chat       
in my present state             

79
00:06:56,482 --> 00:06:58,683
But I'm late                    
for work.                       

80
00:06:58,751 --> 00:06:59,951
            That's okay,        

81
00:07:00,019 --> 00:07:01,453
            I'll just replant   
            your flowers.       

82
00:07:01,521 --> 00:07:03,455
Oh, no, that's alright.         

83
00:07:03,523 --> 00:07:05,624
            Is there anything   
            I can do ?          

84
00:07:05,691 --> 00:07:07,125
                    Uh, no.     

85
00:07:07,193 --> 00:07:09,060
                How 'bout       
                your laundry ?  

86
00:07:09,128 --> 00:07:10,695
                I'm a great     
                ironer.         

87
00:07:10,763 --> 00:07:14,199
If you can just                 
restrain that...                

88
00:07:14,267 --> 00:07:15,934
                    Zeus.

    Thank you.

94
00:07:33,286 --> 00:07:34,553
                Nora.

00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:37,622
            ( groaning )        

96
00:09:04,911 --> 00:09:06,778
You're late.                    

97
00:09:06,846 --> 00:09:08,680
        I've been frantic,      
        don't ask.              

98
00:09:08,748 --> 00:09:10,649
What if Roxanne’s               
not there ?                     

99
00:09:10,716 --> 00:09:12,284
We've never been                
late before.                    

100
00:09:12,351 --> 00:09:13,752
            What if she gets    
            eaten by a shark    

101
00:09:13,819 --> 00:09:15,086
            Sitting there       
            waiting for us ?    

102
00:09:15,154 --> 00:09:19,090
    What if I'm sorry, Becky,   
    I had a rough morning ?     

103
00:09:19,158 --> 00:09:21,259
    Oh, yeah ?                  

104
00:09:21,327 --> 00:09:23,762
            Well, it's about    
            to get rougher.     

105
00:09:23,829 --> 00:09:26,231
        We've been rejected     
        by the Pason Foundation,

108
00:09:31,437 --> 00:09:33,605
Great !

113
00:09:45,117 --> 00:09:47,319
            I wasn't joking.    

114
00:09:47,386 --> 00:09:51,056
    Perhaps we should strive    
    for that grant <i>together.</i>

I don't think so.               

117
00:09:55,328 --> 00:09:58,463
Somehow I think our

are <i>slightly</i> different.         

118

    Let me know                 
    if you change your mind.    

120
00:10:11,644 --> 00:10:14,079
         <i>He</i> should be           
         working with <i>sharks.</i>   

121
00:10:14,146 --> 00:10:15,814
                He'd feel       
                more at home.   

122
00:10:15,881 --> 00:10:18,316
     If I don't get             
     <i>major</i> funding soon         

123
00:10:18,384 --> 00:10:20,018
        Roxanne's gonna         
        be in a <i>pool</i>            

124
00:10:20,086 --> 00:10:22,821
Doing sound recognition tests   
for the <i>rest</i> of her life,       

125
00:10:22,888 --> 00:10:24,889
        Probably for <i>him.</i>       

126
00:10:31,364 --> 00:10:32,631
        Good morning, guys.     

127
00:10:32,698 --> 00:10:34,299
    Hey, Phil.                  

128
00:10:39,372 --> 00:10:42,107
Let's play the sounds of        
the other dolphins for Roxanne  

129
00:10:42,174 --> 00:10:44,109
And see if                      
she runs away.                  

130
00:10:44,176 --> 00:10:48,279
Okay, Roxanne,                  
I'm comin', sweetheart.         

131
00:10:48,347 --> 00:10:50,849
    ( dolphin chirps )          

132
00:11:07,233 --> 00:11:10,502
        We'll do a body check,  
        check for rake marks.   

133
00:11:10,569 --> 00:11:13,104
We'll see if she's been         
playing with other dolphins.    

134
00:11:13,172 --> 00:11:15,373
These are from our              
last session, right ?           

135
00:11:15,441 --> 00:11:16,474
                        Right.  

136
00:11:23,783 --> 00:11:25,684
        ( sniffing )            

137
00:11:25,751 --> 00:11:27,185
        Burritos ?              

138
00:11:27,253 --> 00:11:29,554
                Do you smell    
                burritos ?      

139
00:11:29,622 --> 00:11:31,523
    Yeah.                       

140
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:33,091
        ( loud burp )           

141
00:11:36,962 --> 00:11:38,596
                     <i>You.</i>       

142
00:11:38,664 --> 00:11:39,964
You're so cute !                

143
00:11:40,032 --> 00:11:42,133
                No, this dog    
                is not cute.    

144
00:11:42,201 --> 00:11:44,669
        This dog is             
        the hound from hell.    

145
00:11:44,737 --> 00:11:48,540
C'mon, you Zeus,                
whatever your name is.          

146
00:11:48,607 --> 00:11:50,208
        Get up here,            
        sit down, sit !         

147
00:11:50,276 --> 00:11:53,378

                Zeus !          

153
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:22,834
I think                         
I got Roxanne.                  

154
00:13:22,902 --> 00:13:24,269
        Great !                 

155
00:14:01,307 --> 00:14:03,174
                I'm cursed.     

156
00:14:03,242 --> 00:14:05,109
He's <i>so</i> cute.                   

157
00:14:05,177 --> 00:14:06,578
                He's <i>not</i> cute.  

158
00:14:06,645 --> 00:14:08,112
                You stay        
                right <i>there</i>     

159
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:10,014
    Or you're gonna get         
    a free swimming lesson !    

160
00:14:10,082 --> 00:14:12,951
            He's giving me      
            a face like that.   

161
00:14:23,229 --> 00:14:25,129
            Zeus !              

162
00:14:38,544 --> 00:14:41,279
We've got her.                  

163
00:14:45,651 --> 00:14:47,685
        Roxanne,                
        sorry I'm late.         

164
00:14:51,090 --> 00:14:53,091
    C'mon,                      
    that's a girl.              

165
00:14:53,158 --> 00:14:56,027
Good morning                    
to you too, Roxanne.            

166
00:14:56,095 --> 00:14:57,228
    How are you ?               

167
00:15:08,941 --> 00:15:10,241
C'mon.                          

168
00:15:10,309 --> 00:15:12,243
Very good.                      

169
00:15:27,226 --> 00:15:28,893
Woof, woof !                    

170
00:15:32,064 --> 00:15:34,666
        Thanks a lot, Zeus !    

171
00:17:09,595 --> 00:17:11,396
( Zeus barking )                

172
00:17:35,421 --> 00:17:38,056
    Maybe if we give him        
    some food he'll calm down.  

173
00:17:38,123 --> 00:17:40,925
Maybe if he <i>becomes</i> food        
he'll calm down.                

174
00:17:40,993 --> 00:17:42,160
            She did not         
            mean that.          

175
00:17:42,227 --> 00:17:43,795
Yes, I did.                     

176

where are you ?                 

178

183

    gonna think                 

185
00:19:37,342 --> 00:19:40,144
    I've shanghaied his dog     
    and fed him to the sharks.  

186
00:19:40,212 --> 00:19:41,746
    Zeus ?!

            C'mere !            

190

Get the camera.                 

191
00:20:16,281 --> 00:20:18,783
I got it.                       

192

        We have a canine Zeus,  
        we have Roxanne.        

196
00:20:40,739 --> 00:20:43,374
Woof, woof, woof !              

197
00:20:46,678 --> 00:20:48,346
            What are            
            they <i>doing</i> ?        

198
00:20:48,413 --> 00:20:50,448
Talking to                      
each other.                     

199
00:20:50,515 --> 00:20:52,483
                They're         
                communicating.  

200
00:20:52,551 --> 00:20:54,218

201
00:21:12,404 --> 00:21:13,904
                I think...      

202
00:21:15,407 --> 00:21:17,541
            We're witnessing

                Inter-species   
                communication.

You're gonna get

                Yes !           

208
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:42,833
            I love this dog.    

209
00:21:42,901 --> 00:21:44,001
                I've always     
                loved this dog  

210
00:21:44,069 --> 00:21:46,404
                From the <i>minute </i>
                <i>I saw that dog.</i> 

211
00:21:54,579 --> 00:21:56,547
        Linda, what have        
        you got ?               

212
00:21:56,615 --> 00:21:58,716
Mother and calf.                

213
00:21:58,784 --> 00:22:02,753
    Mother and calf.            
    Yes.                        

214
00:22:02,821 --> 00:22:06,090
Let's separate these two        
for the next 24 hours.          

215
00:22:06,158 --> 00:22:08,459
Begin the sonar                 
recognition test series         

216
00:22:08,527 --> 00:22:11,962
And increase the volume         
of the masking sounds           

217
00:22:12,030 --> 00:22:15,866
Until mother and calf           
can no longer communicate.      

218
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:22,807
            The baby            
            needs to <i>feed.</i>      

219
00:22:22,874 --> 00:22:24,475
"the baby                       
needs to feed."                 

220
00:22:24,543 --> 00:22:27,645
The sacrifice is for            
the <i>good</i> for all mankind.       

221
00:22:27,713 --> 00:22:29,347
For <i>science.</i>                    

222
00:22:32,284 --> 00:22:36,053
Yeah, for                       
Dr. Claude carver.              

223
00:22:37,656 --> 00:22:39,156
            Swing it around.    

224
00:22:40,926 --> 00:22:42,326
    You got it ?                

225
00:22:42,394 --> 00:22:45,096
            Hold it steady.     

226
00:23:07,152 --> 00:23:09,253
( Mary Beth )                   
great submersible.              

227
00:23:09,321 --> 00:23:11,455
Look at that.                   

228
00:23:11,523 --> 00:23:13,924
    I could really use          
    something like <i>that.</i>        

229
00:23:13,992 --> 00:23:15,926
    How'd <i>you</i> get it ?          

230
00:23:15,994 --> 00:23:19,029
                Oh, I pulled    
                a few strings.  

231
00:23:19,097 --> 00:23:21,799
    Perhaps you'd like to       
    take her down sometime.     

232
00:23:21,867 --> 00:23:23,367
Oh, yeah, sure !                

233
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:26,637
    Solo.                       

234
00:23:28,774 --> 00:23:30,674
            I keep telling you  

235
00:23:30,742 --> 00:23:33,010
    Two keen scientific minds   
    are better than one.        

236
00:23:33,078 --> 00:23:35,479
    Yes, but neither            
    are any good                

237
00:23:35,547 --> 00:23:38,315
Without the                     
essential ingredient.           

238
00:23:38,383 --> 00:23:40,217
                    What might  
                    that be ?   

239
00:23:40,285 --> 00:23:42,086
    Heart.                      

240
00:23:42,154 --> 00:23:44,121
                    Sure.       

241
00:23:46,558 --> 00:23:47,758
            Hey, hey !          

242
00:23:47,826 --> 00:23:50,995
I'll <i>drop kick</i> you              
from here to Miami !            

243
00:23:51,062 --> 00:23:52,430
( Mary Beth )                   
no, you will <i>not.</i>               

244
00:23:52,497 --> 00:23:54,999
        C'mon, Zeus,            
        let's get outta here.   

245
00:23:57,002 --> 00:23:59,904
            Phil, get my bag,   
            will you ?          

246
00:24:16,288 --> 00:24:18,456
            There you go.       

247
00:24:18,523 --> 00:24:20,658
            You deserve it.     

248
00:24:23,428 --> 00:24:25,162
( boy )                         
let's go !                      

249
00:24:50,021 --> 00:24:51,222
        Great.                  

250
00:24:56,628 --> 00:24:59,597
Okay, so let me                 
get this straight.              

251
00:24:59,664 --> 00:25:02,466
You don't want us to have       
any fun over the Summer.        

252
00:25:02,534 --> 00:25:05,102
    I don't want you            
    hanging out with            
    borderlines.                

253
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:07,805
Craig isn't                     
borderline, mom.                

254
00:25:07,873 --> 00:25:11,976
     <i>And</i> ditching your          
     enrichment classes.        

255
00:25:12,043 --> 00:25:13,544
            Well, we're just--  

256
00:25:13,612 --> 00:25:15,679
We were just--                  

257
00:25:15,747 --> 00:25:16,981
Rescheduling.                   

258
00:25:17,048 --> 00:25:18,883
                Yes, right.     

259
00:25:18,950 --> 00:25:21,352
        Grounded.               

260
00:25:21,419 --> 00:25:22,853
        This block,             
        one week.               

261
00:25:22,921 --> 00:25:24,822
            Oh, no, mom.        

262
00:25:24,890 --> 00:25:26,657
            Zeus !              

263
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:31,295
            Zeus.               

264
00:25:31,363 --> 00:25:33,297
    Where'd you guys            
    find him ?                  

265
00:25:33,365 --> 00:25:35,866
Actually he found <i>me,</i>           
<i>and you are ?</i>                   

266
00:25:35,934 --> 00:25:38,135
    I'm Jordan Barnett.         
    I'm with him.               

267
00:25:40,272 --> 00:25:43,073
        I see you and Zeus      
        have become friends.    

268
00:25:43,141 --> 00:25:46,443
Well, miracles                  
sometimes happen.               

269
00:25:46,511 --> 00:25:48,345
What's that ?                   

270
00:25:48,413 --> 00:25:51,148
        Some photos             
        I took this morning.    

271
00:25:52,017 --> 00:25:53,717
What ?                          

272
00:25:53,785 --> 00:25:55,786
            I can't             
            believe--           

273
00:25:55,854 --> 00:25:57,721

charming.                       

275
00:25:59,424 --> 00:26:02,359
        Looking good, mom !     

276
00:26:02,427 --> 00:26:04,562
Working on                      
two weeks.                      

277
00:26:04,629 --> 00:26:05,963
        Here.                   

278
00:26:06,031 --> 00:26:08,465
            Your house has      
            a satellite dish,   
            doesn't it ?        

279
00:26:08,533 --> 00:26:09,633
                Yeah.           

280
00:26:09,701 --> 00:26:11,168
            Mom ?               

281
00:26:11,236 --> 00:26:14,038
Okay, but not                   
all the channels.               

282
00:26:14,105 --> 00:26:15,639
            C'mon, Zeus !       

283
00:26:18,643 --> 00:26:21,478
Your dog was on the boat        
with me all day.                

284
00:26:21,546 --> 00:26:22,680
                    Really ?    

285
00:26:22,747 --> 00:26:24,615
        I'm sorry, I won't      
        let that happen again.  

286
00:26:24,683 --> 00:26:26,717
No, actually it sort of         
seemed to suit him.             

287
00:26:26,785 --> 00:26:29,053
            Really.             

288
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:30,421
Really.                         

289
00:26:30,488 --> 00:26:32,990
I'd like to                     
take him out <i>again</i> if --        

290
00:26:33,058 --> 00:26:35,426
    Sure, you can take him      
    on a cruise to Antarctica,  

291
00:26:35,493 --> 00:26:38,963
        But he's Jordan's dog.  

292
00:26:40,632 --> 00:26:42,600
    Would you mind              

293
00:26:42,667 --> 00:26:44,668
    If I just ask               
    him something ?             

294
00:26:44,736 --> 00:26:47,004
Go right ahead.                 

295
00:26:47,606 --> 00:26:49,640
                Gimme that !    

296
00:26:49,708 --> 00:26:51,709
Can I just watch this           
for a <i>minute</i> ?                  

297
00:26:53,178 --> 00:26:55,079
    Girls, girls,               
    time out.                   

298
00:26:55,146 --> 00:26:57,247
            Where's Jordan ?    

299
00:26:57,315 --> 00:26:59,116
In there.                       

300
00:26:59,184 --> 00:27:01,485
        What are you            
        watching ?              

301
00:27:03,121 --> 00:27:05,856
                ( Mary Beth )   
                hello.          

302
00:27:05,924 --> 00:27:06,957
Oh, hi.                         

303
00:27:07,025 --> 00:27:08,125
            Hi, can I come in ? 

304
00:27:08,193 --> 00:27:10,094
Yeah, sure.                     

305
00:27:10,161 --> 00:27:12,329
                "braveheart".   

306
00:27:12,397 --> 00:27:14,331
                Wow !           

307
00:27:14,399 --> 00:27:16,233
                Did you do      
                all these ?     

308
00:27:16,301 --> 00:27:18,135
        Yeah.                   

309
00:27:18,203 --> 00:27:20,838
That one's gonna be the cover   
for my dad's opera score.       

310
00:27:20,905 --> 00:27:23,907
                Your dad        
                writes opera ?  

311
00:27:23,975 --> 00:27:26,210
It's a rock opera.              

312
00:27:26,277 --> 00:27:27,811
    Most of the time            
    he does music               

313
00:27:27,879 --> 00:27:30,247
    For commercials             
    and really tall elevators.  

314
00:27:30,315 --> 00:27:32,049
        It's only               
        to pay the bills.       

315
00:27:32,117 --> 00:27:37,488
( woman on TV )               
we have now brought the         
psychic friends network...      

316
00:27:37,555 --> 00:27:41,425
Love that                       
satellite dish, huh ?           

317
00:27:41,493 --> 00:27:43,794
        This is gonna           
        sound really lame,      

318
00:27:43,862 --> 00:27:46,163
    But we don't even           
    have <i>one</i> TV in our house.   

319
00:27:46,231 --> 00:27:49,400
             We're like a media 
             <i>impaired</i> family.   

320
00:27:49,467 --> 00:27:51,135
            Oh.                 

321
00:27:57,909 --> 00:28:00,144
            Hey, is this        
            your mom ?          

322
00:28:00,211 --> 00:28:02,079
Yeah... She died.               

323
00:28:03,615 --> 00:28:06,483
        Sorry to hear that.     
        You must miss her a lot.

324
00:28:13,158 --> 00:28:15,926
            Can I talk to you   
            for a minute ?      

325
00:28:15,994 --> 00:28:17,961
        Yeah.                   

326
00:28:22,467 --> 00:28:25,169
I think Zeus is                 
a very special dog.             

327
00:28:25,236 --> 00:28:28,539
        What do                 
        you mean ?              

328
00:28:28,606 --> 00:28:31,075
Well...                         

329
00:28:31,142 --> 00:28:36,380
I <i>think</i> that Zeus               
is capable of--                 

330
00:28:36,448 --> 00:28:39,683
Inter-species                   
communication.                  

331
00:28:39,751 --> 00:28:42,820
    What's the big deal ?       
    I talk to Zeus all the time.

332
00:28:42,887 --> 00:28:45,255
        Ah,                     

333
00:28:45,323 --> 00:28:47,691
But <i>Zeus</i> is talking             
with my <i>dolphin.</i>                

334
00:28:47,759 --> 00:28:50,461
            You own             
            a <i>dolphin</i> ?         

335
00:28:50,528 --> 00:28:52,996
I don't <i>own</i> her,                
Roxanne lives in the bay,       

336
00:28:53,064 --> 00:28:54,732
But I kinda                     
take care of her.               

337
00:28:54,799 --> 00:28:56,467
She used to                     
live in a tank.                 

338
00:28:56,534 --> 00:28:59,369
We're reintroducing her         
into the ocean.                 

339
00:28:59,437 --> 00:29:02,406
Now the problem is,             

340
00:29:02,474 --> 00:29:05,476
That she doesn't really         
take to other dolphins.         

341
00:29:05,543 --> 00:29:08,912
But she seems                   
to like your Zeus.              

342
00:29:08,980 --> 00:29:11,281
So I was thinking,              

343
00:29:11,349 --> 00:29:13,350
        It might be             
        really interesting      

344
00:29:13,418 --> 00:29:15,652
        To get the two together,
        Zeus and Roxanne,       

345
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:17,855
        And just see how things 
        go from <i>there.</i>          

346
00:29:17,922 --> 00:29:20,491
                What do         
                you think ?     

347
00:29:20,558 --> 00:29:24,528
Well, this has to be            
Zeus' decision.                 

348
00:29:24,596 --> 00:29:26,864
                        Alright.

349
00:29:28,066 --> 00:29:31,769
        So, Zeus, would you like
        to go out with Roxanne ?

350
00:29:31,836 --> 00:29:33,670
            Woof, woof !        

351
00:29:33,738 --> 00:29:35,672
            Is that             
            a "yes" ?           

352
00:29:35,740 --> 00:29:37,207
                    Woof !      

353
00:29:37,275 --> 00:29:38,876
Yeah.                           

354
00:29:38,943 --> 00:29:40,177
                    Great.      

355
00:29:44,415 --> 00:29:46,016
                    You like    
                    our mom ?   

356
00:29:46,084 --> 00:29:47,785
    Yeah, sure I do.            

357
00:29:47,852 --> 00:29:51,054
    Enough to                   
    go out with her ?           

358
00:29:51,122 --> 00:29:53,924
                    How 'bout   
                    Saturday ?  

359
00:30:19,651 --> 00:30:22,119
Alright.                        

360
00:30:22,187 --> 00:30:23,754
It's okay.                      

361
00:30:23,822 --> 00:30:26,857
Okay,                           
new behavior.                   

362
00:30:29,727 --> 00:30:32,296
That's it.                      

363
00:31:03,394 --> 00:31:07,331
What is she <i>doing</i> out there     
with that dog ?                 

364
00:31:07,398 --> 00:31:09,900
                Havin' fun.     

365
00:31:09,968 --> 00:31:12,135
            No.                 

366
00:31:12,203 --> 00:31:15,038
    I'll tell you               
    what she's doing.           

367
00:31:15,106 --> 00:31:18,175
    She's trying to             
    steal my grant.             

368
00:31:18,243 --> 00:31:21,345
    That's just not             
    gonna happen.               

369
00:31:21,412 --> 00:31:23,614
        No, sir !               

370
00:31:46,738 --> 00:31:49,273
Hey, watch where                
you're going !                  

371
00:31:49,340 --> 00:31:51,675
        I <i>was</i> and I <i>am.</i>         

372
00:31:51,743 --> 00:31:53,443
You're driving too fast.        
There are kids around.          

373
00:31:53,511 --> 00:31:54,645
Oh, I'm sorry.                  

374
00:31:54,712 --> 00:31:57,214
I was in a hurry                
to visit with Miss Dunhill.     

375
00:31:57,282 --> 00:31:58,615
        Apparently              
        so were you,            

376
00:31:58,683 --> 00:32:00,684
And failed to look both ways    
before crossing the street.     

377
00:32:00,752 --> 00:32:02,686
        Thank God               
        for anti-lock brakes.   

378
00:32:02,754 --> 00:32:04,855
What are you                    
doing here ?                    

379
00:32:04,923 --> 00:32:07,124
        These are the manuals   
        for the submersible.    

380
00:32:07,191 --> 00:32:08,759
        It's yours whenever     
        you want it.            

381
00:32:08,826 --> 00:32:10,761
Really ?                        

382
00:32:10,828 --> 00:32:13,063
( man )                         
invite me in,                   
I'll go over them with you.     

383
00:32:13,131 --> 00:32:15,065
Alright.                        

384
00:32:15,133 --> 00:32:18,835
Terry, did you                  
need something ?                

385
00:32:18,903 --> 00:32:21,004
            Oh, no,             
            it's not important. 

386
00:32:21,072 --> 00:32:23,106
Alright.                        

387
00:32:23,174 --> 00:32:25,142
            Never is.           

388
00:32:34,953 --> 00:32:37,721
        So, this is             
        a surprise.             

389
00:32:37,789 --> 00:32:39,056
    It is ?                     

390
00:32:39,123 --> 00:32:40,791
                    Bye, mom.   

391
00:32:40,858 --> 00:32:42,292
    We're goin'                 
    for a test ride.            

392
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:43,794
            I thought you two   
            were grounded.      

393
00:32:43,861 --> 00:32:45,295
Just around                     
the block.                      

394
00:32:45,363 --> 00:32:47,597
                With Zeus       
                and Jordan.     

395
00:32:47,665 --> 00:32:48,598
Please, mom ?                   

396
00:32:48,666 --> 00:32:49,933
Come on mom !                   

397
00:32:50,001 --> 00:32:51,101
            One block.          

398
00:32:51,169 --> 00:32:53,270
I love you !                    

399
00:32:56,541 --> 00:32:58,642
        Thank you,              
        mommy.                  

400
00:32:58,710 --> 00:33:01,111
Bye, mom !                      

401
00:33:01,179 --> 00:33:04,448
You should think about          
boarding school for those two.  

402
00:33:04,515 --> 00:33:07,117
Now, where were we ?            

403
00:33:07,185 --> 00:33:09,720
                The catch.      

404
00:33:09,787 --> 00:33:12,089
No catch.                       

405
00:33:15,393 --> 00:33:18,161
        Boy.                    
        This is it ?            

406
00:33:18,229 --> 00:33:19,730
This is it.                     

407
00:33:31,309 --> 00:33:34,011
    I don't know                
    about this.                 

408
00:33:34,078 --> 00:33:35,979
    Woof, woof !                

409
00:33:41,886 --> 00:33:44,588
                Hey, get out    
                of there !      

410
00:34:10,081 --> 00:34:12,149
        ( sirens )              

411
00:34:26,931 --> 00:34:29,800
        This is <i>definitely </i>     
        <i>getting out of hand.</i>    

412
00:34:50,455 --> 00:34:52,656
    Okay, hold it               
    right there.                

413
00:34:55,827 --> 00:34:57,627
Judith ?                        

414
00:35:08,106 --> 00:35:09,539
What's going on ?               

415
00:35:09,607 --> 00:35:11,541
            Judith and Nora     
            are getting busted. 

416
00:35:11,609 --> 00:35:13,944
            This is probably    
            their first offense.

417
00:35:14,011 --> 00:35:16,947
    I can probably get them off 
    with a stern warning.       

418
00:35:17,014 --> 00:35:18,715
Mm-hmm.                         

419
00:35:18,783 --> 00:35:20,550
C'mon.                          

420
00:35:23,588 --> 00:35:26,189
    So, am I                    
    to believe                  

421
00:35:26,257 --> 00:35:28,058
That cute little dog            
and your dolphin                

422
00:35:28,126 --> 00:35:29,860
Are actually talking ?          

423
00:35:29,927 --> 00:35:31,294
            Incessantly.        

424
00:35:31,362 --> 00:35:32,496
Wow.                            

425
00:35:32,563 --> 00:35:35,365
I have all this communication   
skills data on file.            

426
00:35:35,433 --> 00:35:37,234
Perhaps you might               
wanna reconsider                

427
00:35:37,301 --> 00:35:38,802
About pooling                   
our research                    

428
00:35:38,870 --> 00:35:41,471
And applying for that           
Rockland Mammal Grant together ?

429
00:35:41,539 --> 00:35:42,939
The catch !                     

430
00:35:43,007 --> 00:35:45,108
            What, what catch ?  

431
00:35:45,176 --> 00:35:46,543
I'm sorry,                      
I'm sorry.                      

432
00:35:46,611 --> 00:35:48,445
I already applied               
for my grant.                   

433
00:35:48,513 --> 00:35:50,580
    But thanks                  
    for the mini sub.           

434
00:35:50,648 --> 00:35:53,650
    It was very                 
    unselfish of you.           

435
00:35:56,020 --> 00:35:59,322
            Hey, thanks for     
            talking deputy dog  

436
00:35:59,390 --> 00:36:02,425
                Out of serious  
                jail time.      

437
00:36:02,493 --> 00:36:03,860
        You're welcome,         
        youngster.              

438
00:36:03,928 --> 00:36:05,162
                What's          
                the catch ?     

439
00:36:05,229 --> 00:36:07,230
            Probably a lecture, 
            right, Jordan ?     

440
00:36:07,298 --> 00:36:09,599
No, he's not                    
too good at those.              

441
00:36:09,667 --> 00:36:11,101
        But, I'm gonna <i>try.</i>     

442
00:36:11,169 --> 00:36:14,504
( motorcycle approaching )      

443
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:19,743
( Terry )                       
that's it, all off              
who are gettin' off !           

444
00:36:23,681 --> 00:36:25,615
    Just around                 
    the block ?                 

445
00:36:25,683 --> 00:36:28,251
Do you two girls even <i>know</i>      
<i>what time it is ?</i>               

446
00:36:28,319 --> 00:36:29,252
        Yeah.                   

447
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:32,489
    It's time for the           
    marlins-reds game.          

448
00:36:32,557 --> 00:36:33,823
                Huh ?           

449
00:36:33,891 --> 00:36:35,959
            On your             
            satellite dish.     

450
00:36:36,027 --> 00:36:38,128
                It's been real !

451
00:36:38,196 --> 00:36:40,297
        ( Jordan )              
        did I miss something ?  

452
00:36:40,364 --> 00:36:42,432
Tell me they weren't            
robbing a bank ?                

453
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:44,734
            They weren't        
            robbing a bank.     

454
00:36:44,802 --> 00:36:47,003
Thank you.                      

455
00:36:50,875 --> 00:36:53,610
                They're <i>still</i>   
                <i>talking ?</i>       

456
00:36:53,678 --> 00:36:55,378
        Probably                
        busting us.             

457
00:36:55,446 --> 00:36:56,947
                Not Terry.      

458
00:36:57,014 --> 00:36:59,549
                Give me those ! 
                I can read lips.

            "ride to live."     

461
00:37:04,689 --> 00:37:06,356
            A way of life.      

462
00:37:06,424 --> 00:37:08,058
"a way of life" ?               

463
00:37:08,125 --> 00:37:11,728
    That's just a logo          
    they use to sell the bike.  

464
00:37:11,796 --> 00:37:16,233
Who cares about reading lips ?  
I'm reading <i>body</i> language.      

465
00:37:16,300 --> 00:37:18,034
    And they are talking        
    a <i>mile</i> a minute.            

466
00:37:18,102 --> 00:37:19,402
                    Oh, yeah.   

467
00:37:19,470 --> 00:37:20,770
        What are                
        they saying ?           

468
00:37:20,838 --> 00:37:23,173

                him out.

00:37:23,241 --> 00:37:24,841
        ( Judith )              
        no way.                 

470
00:37:24,909 --> 00:37:26,776
                        Way.    

471
00:37:26,844 --> 00:37:27,844
Woof, woof !                    

472
00:37:27,912 --> 00:37:29,679
        Whoa.                   

473
00:37:29,747 --> 00:37:31,248
                Okay.           

474
00:37:31,916 --> 00:37:35,085
                You can--       

475
00:37:35,152 --> 00:37:36,586
                    Right.

See, mom ?                      
You can look good when you try. 

483
00:38:01,612 --> 00:38:03,113

If you'd like,                  
you can hang onto the back      

492
00:38:33,377 --> 00:38:37,147
Or you can put your hands       
around my waist.                

493
00:38:37,214 --> 00:38:38,915
                Okay.

( Judith )                      
we think you spend too much     
time alone, Jordan.             

504
00:39:19,590 --> 00:39:22,926
            We've <i>gotta</i> do      
            something about it. 

505
00:39:29,934 --> 00:39:32,435

506
00:39:55,993 --> 00:39:58,194
Oh, he put it--                 

507
00:40:04,301 --> 00:40:05,835
I don't know                    
how to play poker.              

508
00:40:05,903 --> 00:40:08,772
        That's okay, Jordan,    
        we'll teach you.        

509
00:40:08,839 --> 00:40:10,173
The main thing                  
you need to know                

510
00:40:10,241 --> 00:40:11,875
Is you <i>have</i> to                  
bet something.                  

511
00:40:11,942 --> 00:40:13,843
     But I don't                
     <i>have</i> any money.            

512
00:40:13,911 --> 00:40:15,345
            That's okay, too.   

513
00:40:15,413 --> 00:40:17,480
            I'm sure we can     
            think of <i>something.</i> 

514
00:40:17,548 --> 00:40:20,116
Maybe we can                    
bet <i>chores</i> ?                    

515
00:40:20,184 --> 00:40:21,418

516
00:40:21,485 --> 00:40:23,153
What <i>kind</i> of chores ?           

517
00:40:23,220 --> 00:40:25,588
Stuff your parents make         
you do around the house         

518
00:40:25,656 --> 00:40:27,223
So they feel                    
you're useful.                  

519
00:40:27,291 --> 00:40:28,358
You know,                       
chores.                         

520
00:40:28,426 --> 00:40:31,294

around here.                    

521
00:40:31,362 --> 00:40:34,564
You won't have to.              
If you win, that is.            

522
00:40:34,632 --> 00:40:35,965
        Deal.                   

523
00:40:38,102 --> 00:40:40,270
This Claude guy--               

524

                    Every day.  

526
00:40:46,544 --> 00:40:48,611
Oh, really ?                    

527
00:40:48,679 --> 00:40:51,681
                Really and      
                unfortunately.  

528
00:40:53,117 --> 00:40:55,518
        He's the head honcho    
        at the institute.       

529
00:40:55,586 --> 00:40:57,320

            his assistant,      

530
00:40:57,388 --> 00:41:00,190
        But we had              
        a parting of the ways.  

531
00:41:00,257 --> 00:41:03,626
Oh. Would it be tactless        
to ask over what ?              

532
00:41:03,694 --> 00:41:06,296
                Third party.    

533
00:41:06,363 --> 00:41:09,833
Oh, I apologize,                
never mind--                    

534
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:12,335
                    A dolphin.  

535
00:41:12,403 --> 00:41:15,004
"a dolphin."                    

536
00:41:15,072 --> 00:41:17,774
            I happened to think 
            that the dolphin    

537
00:41:17,842 --> 00:41:20,643
            Was more important  
            than <i>his</i> career.    

538
00:41:20,711 --> 00:41:21,644
I agree.                        

539
00:41:21,712 --> 00:41:23,179

541
00:41:33,190 --> 00:41:36,292
You have three of a kind.       
That's excellent.               

542
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:39,629
            Yeah, but I have    
            the two of clubs.   

543
00:41:39,697 --> 00:41:41,965
Two of clubs

544

Sorry, man.                     

545
00:41:44,568 --> 00:41:47,570
    Gonna have to               
    clean my room for a month.  

546
00:41:47,638 --> 00:41:49,639
( Judith )                      
sorry.                          

547
00:42:01,519 --> 00:42:03,520
                    Whoa !      

548
00:42:22,339 --> 00:42:25,775
    Let's see, Jordan,          
    you've got tens and jacks.  

549
00:42:25,843 --> 00:42:28,044
            That's two pair.    
            That's real good--  

550
00:42:28,112 --> 00:42:31,247
    But, I have a three,        
    a five,                     

551
00:42:31,315 --> 00:42:34,317
A seven, a Jack                 
and a Queen.                    

552
00:42:34,385 --> 00:42:37,921
Cutthroat straight.             
That beats <i>you,</i> sorry.          

553
00:42:37,988 --> 00:42:40,957
    You're gonna have to        
    water our plants for...     

554
00:42:41,025 --> 00:42:43,293
            Two weeks.          

555
00:42:59,610 --> 00:43:01,210
                We better       
                get going.      

556
00:43:01,278 --> 00:43:03,379
                    We will...  

557
00:43:03,447 --> 00:43:04,948
                    Eventually. 

558
00:43:08,819 --> 00:43:11,821
You said that dolphins          
are telepathic.                 

559
00:43:14,291 --> 00:43:16,225
            How about people ?  

560
00:43:18,462 --> 00:43:20,797
Some people.                    

561
00:43:23,100 --> 00:43:24,801
                    Your bet.   

562
00:43:24,868 --> 00:43:26,703
Double                          
or nothing.                     

563
00:43:26,770 --> 00:43:29,005
I'm your slave                  
for the rest of the Summer      

564
00:43:29,073 --> 00:43:31,307
Or we're back                   
to even.                        

565
00:43:31,375 --> 00:43:33,176
                    You sure ?  

566
00:43:33,243 --> 00:43:35,178
I like to live                  
on the edge.                    

567
00:43:35,245 --> 00:43:38,214
        Well, you just          
        crashed and burned.     

568
00:43:38,282 --> 00:43:40,149
        I have                  
        a straight <i>flush.</i>       

569
00:43:40,217 --> 00:43:43,119
Oh, yeah,                       
oh, yeah.                       

570
00:43:43,187 --> 00:43:45,388
And you know what ?             

571
00:43:45,456 --> 00:43:48,958
This is

573
00:43:53,097 --> 00:43:55,064
                    How'd you   
                    do that ?

575

            I had               
            a great time.       

576
00:44:24,962 --> 00:44:26,729
You sound                       
surprised.                      

577
00:44:26,797 --> 00:44:28,297

578
00:44:28,365 --> 00:44:29,966

                no, no, no,     

579
00:44:30,034 --> 00:44:31,567

580
00:44:31,635 --> 00:44:33,703
        That I'm surprised      
        that I had a good time. 

581
00:44:33,771 --> 00:44:36,372
                        I'm...

                into it.

    ( Jordan )                  
    give him a break,           
    he's a little Rusty.

you doing ?

Okay,                           

603
00:47:29,346 --> 00:47:31,914
You're a weird dog.             

604
00:47:46,363 --> 00:47:49,265
It's the creature               
from the black lagoon.          

605
00:47:49,333 --> 00:47:51,934

607
00:48:01,678 --> 00:48:03,546
Creature, sir !                 

608
00:48:05,716 --> 00:48:08,784
        ( guitar riff )         

609
00:48:11,488 --> 00:48:13,689
        I think                 
        they hear you.          

610
00:48:13,757 --> 00:48:17,159
That's where                    
Roxanne should be.              

611

With <i>them.</i>

613
00:48:27,437 --> 00:48:29,372
I think you've                  
got yourself a band.            

614
00:48:29,439 --> 00:48:30,940
            Good job, mates !

616
00:48:33,176 --> 00:48:34,710
            Everybody sober !   

617
00:48:34,778 --> 00:48:36,979
            You know            
            dolphins.           

618
00:48:37,047 --> 00:48:38,614
Yeah.                           

619
00:48:41,985 --> 00:48:44,687
I don't wanna                   
lose you, Terry.                

620
00:48:44,755 --> 00:48:46,756
            I don't wanna       
            lose me either.     

621
00:48:53,563 --> 00:48:55,765
When are                        
you leaving ?                   

622
00:48:57,567 --> 00:48:59,969
        I gotta go              
        to Boca Raton...        

623
00:49:00,037 --> 00:49:02,872
            For a week,         
            mix my tracks,      

624
00:49:02,940 --> 00:49:04,941
            Then it's off       
            to Boston           

625
00:49:05,008 --> 00:49:09,612
            And a regular job,  
            Jordan's in school. 

626
00:49:11,381 --> 00:49:13,516
            How 'bout you ?     

627
00:49:13,583 --> 00:49:16,585
I'm here through the Summer

628
00:49:16,653 --> 00:49:19,088
            And if you don't    
            get the grant ?     

629
00:49:19,156 --> 00:49:23,793

                Ugh !           

631
00:49:27,564 --> 00:49:29,999
Mary Beth won't share,          
will she ?                      

632
00:49:30,067 --> 00:49:31,567
Neither will I !

<i>inter-species communication !</i>   

635
00:49:39,810 --> 00:49:41,744
Let's start with her.           

636
00:49:41,812 --> 00:49:44,080
She looks sickeningly           
cute enough.                    

637
00:49:51,288 --> 00:49:54,056
( whimpering & yelping )        

638
00:50:14,244 --> 00:50:16,645
                ( snoring )     

639
00:51:01,558 --> 00:51:03,626
                    See ya.     
See ya.                         

640
00:51:05,996 --> 00:51:07,763
I'd like to                     
thank you.                      

641
00:51:07,831 --> 00:51:09,732
            Really, for what ?  

642
00:51:09,800 --> 00:51:11,233
            'cause we're going  
            down in the sub ?   

643
00:51:11,301 --> 00:51:13,436
            I should be         
            thanking <i>you.</i>       

644
00:51:13,503 --> 00:51:16,038
No, I mean thanks               
for helping Terry.              

645
00:51:16,106 --> 00:51:19,308
He hasn't been able

uh-oh, drift nets.              

649
00:51:50,674 --> 00:51:53,776
They kill thousands             
of dolphins every year.         

650
00:51:53,844 --> 00:51:55,945
Where do they                   
come from ?                     

651
00:51:56,012 --> 00:51:57,980

    leave next week.            

654
00:52:37,787 --> 00:52:40,422
    There's a new               
    family moving in.           

655
00:52:40,490 --> 00:52:42,158
You could stay                  
at <i>our</i> house.

what brings <i>you</i> here ?          

660
00:53:22,566 --> 00:53:25,301
        You've burned           
        the school down.        

661
00:53:30,907 --> 00:53:33,676
        Then, why are           
        you here ?              

662
00:53:42,686 --> 00:53:44,286
Thank you.

        eating salads ?         

667
00:53:57,534 --> 00:54:00,069
You always                      
eat salad, mom.                 

668
00:54:00,136 --> 00:54:02,137
        Why can can't <i>we</i>        
        <i>eat salad ?</i>             

669
00:54:06,476 --> 00:54:09,044
            I'm sorry,          
            no satellite dish.  

670
00:54:09,112 --> 00:54:11,547
        They're too expensive,  
        we can't afford it--    

671
00:54:11,615 --> 00:54:14,717
No, mom,                        
it's not a satellite dish.      

672
00:54:14,784 --> 00:54:18,053
It's really that                
Terry and Jordan                

673
00:54:18,121 --> 00:54:20,589
Need a place                    
to live for a while.            

674
00:54:20,657 --> 00:54:23,859
We want them at our house.      
We have two extra rooms.        

675
00:54:23,927 --> 00:54:25,194
Yeah,                           
c'mon, mom.                     

676
00:54:25,262 --> 00:54:26,762
            Whoa, whoa.         

677
00:54:26,830 --> 00:54:29,832
    Why do you think            
    they're even <i>interested</i>     
    <i>in staying at our house ?</i>   

678
00:54:29,899 --> 00:54:30,966
Well, Jordan does.              

679
00:54:31,034 --> 00:54:33,402
And so                          
does Terry.                     

680
00:54:33,470 --> 00:54:35,304

681
00:54:35,372 --> 00:54:37,873
Jordan told us.                 

682
00:54:42,178 --> 00:54:45,814
He told us                      
lots of stuff.                  

683
00:54:45,882 --> 00:54:47,916
Curious                         
to know, mom ?                  

684
00:54:56,559 --> 00:55:00,062
                What <i>exactly </i>   
                <i>did they say ?</i>  

685
00:55:00,130 --> 00:55:02,197
Okay, well--                    

686
00:55:02,265 --> 00:55:03,399
    It started out...           

687
00:55:03,466 --> 00:55:05,567
The rest of                     
the Summer ?                    

688
00:55:05,635 --> 00:55:07,469
You sure this was               
Mary Beth’s idea ?              

689
00:55:07,537 --> 00:55:09,738
And where are                   
my Twinkies ?!                  

690
00:55:09,806 --> 00:55:11,940
                I made you      
                a fruit salad.  

691
00:55:12,008 --> 00:55:14,443
            It's in             
            the refrigerator.   

692
00:55:14,511 --> 00:55:16,345
    And of course,              
    it <i>was</i> her idea.            

693
00:55:16,413 --> 00:55:17,880
            You're <i>sure.</i>        

694
00:55:17,947 --> 00:55:20,182
Absolutely.                     

695
00:55:20,250 --> 00:55:22,951
And dad,                        
use a spoon ?                   

696
00:55:23,019 --> 00:55:25,054
                Mm-hmm.         

697
00:55:25,855 --> 00:55:27,289
            Right here,         
            I knew that.        

698
00:55:28,058 --> 00:55:30,292
        Now, before             
        we do this,             

699
00:55:30,360 --> 00:55:32,661
    There's a few things        
    you gotta know about me.    

700
00:55:32,729 --> 00:55:34,029
                    Uh-oh.      

701
00:55:34,097 --> 00:55:36,699
    You one of these guys that  
    howls at the full Moon ?    

702
00:55:36,766 --> 00:55:37,933
    I'm afraid so.              

703
00:55:38,001 --> 00:55:39,535
                    Oh, dear.   

704
00:55:39,602 --> 00:55:41,537
            It's a little late  
            to be reticent now. 

705
00:55:41,604 --> 00:55:43,605
            After all,          
            this was <i>your</i> idea. 

706
00:55:43,673 --> 00:55:45,474
         <i>My</i> idea ?              

707
00:55:45,542 --> 00:55:46,642
                    Mm-hmm.     

708
00:55:46,710 --> 00:55:49,078
        Jordan said             
        it was--                

709
00:55:49,145 --> 00:55:51,780
    Jordan said                 
    it was <i>your</i> idea for--      

710
00:55:53,516 --> 00:55:56,585
        No, the girls told <i>me </i>  
        <i>that you said--</i>         

711
00:55:56,653 --> 00:55:58,921
        No, I--                 

712
00:55:58,988 --> 00:56:01,190
        We've been set <i>up.</i>      

713
00:56:01,257 --> 00:56:04,426
By world-class                  
professionals.                  

714
00:56:22,645 --> 00:56:24,179
    Well ?                      

715
00:56:24,247 --> 00:56:27,383
What are we gonna do,           
professor ?                     

716
00:56:29,552 --> 00:56:30,886
Well...                         

717
00:56:33,690 --> 00:56:35,424
I <i>suppose...</i>                    

718
00:56:37,026 --> 00:56:40,396
If you stayed that I could      
continue my work with Zeus.     

719
00:56:40,463 --> 00:56:42,297
                Mm-hmm, and...  

720
00:56:42,365 --> 00:56:45,334
                I could finish  
                my second act.  

721
00:56:47,570 --> 00:56:49,671
So, I guess we'll               
just have to                    

722
00:56:49,739 --> 00:56:51,907
Make the best of it.            

723
00:56:54,210 --> 00:56:55,911
     <i>Man,</i> we're good.           

724
00:56:55,979 --> 00:56:57,312
Woof, woof !                    

725
00:57:48,164 --> 00:57:50,666
Should I take this stuff        
next door now ?                 

726
00:57:50,733 --> 00:57:52,634
        Just put it             
        outside first.          

727
00:57:52,702 --> 00:57:54,303
Why ?                           

728
00:57:54,370 --> 00:57:57,039
        'cause I said so.       

729
00:57:57,106 --> 00:57:59,007
     <i>Jeesh !</i>                    

730
00:58:05,014 --> 00:58:06,982
Lemonade ?                      

731
00:58:07,050 --> 00:58:08,851
            No, thank you.      

732
00:58:14,858 --> 00:58:16,992
What happened ?                 

733
00:58:18,795 --> 00:58:20,362
                Nothing.        

734
00:58:25,535 --> 00:58:28,337
What <i>didn't</i> happen ?            

735
00:58:37,113 --> 00:58:38,714
        Jordan ?                

736
00:58:38,781 --> 00:58:41,049
It's gone south.                

737
00:58:57,300 --> 00:59:00,903
    What are we <i>doing</i> this for ?
    Are we doing this for <i>us</i> ?  

738
00:59:00,970 --> 00:59:03,405
    Are we doing this for       
    the Rockland foundation ?   

739
00:59:03,473 --> 00:59:06,508
            Are we doing it     
            for the <i>kids</i> ?      

740
00:59:06,576 --> 00:59:07,910
                What ?          

741
00:59:09,712 --> 00:59:11,713
All of the above.               

742
00:59:25,562 --> 00:59:27,796
                I don't know.   

743
00:59:31,200 --> 00:59:33,201
                I don't know.   

744
00:59:37,240 --> 00:59:39,241
It's okay, just--               

745
00:59:41,511 --> 00:59:44,413
Take as much time               
as you need.                    

746
00:59:51,788 --> 00:59:54,289
                ( Jordan )      
                it's time       
                to go, Zeus.    

747
00:59:57,594 --> 00:59:59,595
            I don't             
            understand.         

748
00:59:59,662 --> 01:00:02,965
        If a dog and a dolphin  
        can get along           

749
01:00:03,032 --> 01:00:05,734
        Why can't our mom       
        and his dad ?           

750
01:00:22,952 --> 01:00:25,087
( Zeus whining )                

751
01:00:26,222 --> 01:00:28,624
    Woof, woof !                

752
01:00:30,460 --> 01:00:32,527
        Zeus, <i>please.</i>           

753
01:00:34,464 --> 01:00:37,165
                I feel          
                badly enough.   

754
01:00:37,233 --> 01:00:39,868
    Then why don't you          
    turn around ?               

755
01:00:41,971 --> 01:00:43,405
        I wish I could.         

756
01:00:43,473 --> 01:00:45,340
    I don't see                 
    anyone <i>else</i> driving.        

757
01:00:45,408 --> 01:00:47,409
            Jordan !            

758
01:01:38,895 --> 01:01:41,129
Hey,                            
good morning, boss.             

759
01:01:48,771 --> 01:01:50,772
Hey, you alright ?              

760
01:01:54,677 --> 01:01:56,678
                What's wrong ?  

761
01:01:59,415 --> 01:02:01,516
They're gone.                   

762
01:02:03,519 --> 01:02:05,821
So is Zeus.                     

763
01:02:09,492 --> 01:02:11,526
They're just gone.              

764
01:02:15,798 --> 01:02:17,833
            Men and dogs, huh ? 

765
01:02:17,900 --> 01:02:19,234
                C'mere.         

766
01:02:21,904 --> 01:02:23,405
        It's okay.              

767
01:02:25,942 --> 01:02:27,843
         <i>Oh.</i>                    

768
01:02:27,910 --> 01:02:29,811
    I could almost cry.         

769
01:02:31,514 --> 01:02:33,315
    Tears of Joy.               

770
01:02:34,217 --> 01:02:36,384
    That dolphin                
    is fair game now,           

771
01:02:36,452 --> 01:02:38,053
Track her.                      

772
01:03:32,108 --> 01:03:33,708
    C'mon, Zeus.                

773
01:03:36,245 --> 01:03:38,547
    Zeus, c'mon.                

774
01:03:45,888 --> 01:03:47,155
                 <i>Zeus.</i>          

775
01:03:49,025 --> 01:03:50,525
                 <i>C'mon.</i>         

776
01:05:42,038 --> 01:05:43,939
What is she doing ?             

777
01:05:44,006 --> 01:05:45,740
                I don't know.   

778
01:05:56,085 --> 01:05:58,086
    She's running away.         

779
01:06:04,894 --> 01:06:07,829
        She won't let us        
        near her anymore.       

780
01:06:13,069 --> 01:06:16,671
So much for inter-species       
communication.                  

781
01:06:16,739 --> 01:06:18,673
        That's what happens     

782
01:06:18,741 --> 01:06:20,842
        When you work with these
        animals in the wild.    

783
01:06:20,910 --> 01:06:23,445
        They can walk out on you
        whenever they want to.  

784
01:06:23,512 --> 01:06:26,247
        If we can bring Roxanne 
        back into the lab--     

785
01:06:26,315 --> 01:06:27,782
    Dr. Carver,                 

786
01:06:27,850 --> 01:06:29,985
It's illegal to catch           
a dolphin in the open sea.      

787
01:06:30,052 --> 01:06:31,720
                Excuse <i>me,</i> Phil.

788
01:06:31,787 --> 01:06:34,055
You know                        
he's right.                     

789
01:06:34,123 --> 01:06:37,058
I'll replace Roxanne            
with one of the simpletons,     

790
01:06:37,126 --> 01:06:39,594
    Perhaps even <i>two.</i>           

791
01:06:39,662 --> 01:06:42,097
As scientists                   
we have to circumvent           

792
01:06:42,164 --> 01:06:45,200
These ridiculous                
bureaucratic regulations.       

793
01:06:49,672 --> 01:06:52,974
            ( man whistling )   

794
01:07:11,827 --> 01:07:14,396
    Girls, dinner !             

795
01:07:15,965 --> 01:07:20,068
Feeding time at                 
the enrichment program.         

796
01:07:20,136 --> 01:07:22,504
                I resent that.  

797
01:07:22,571 --> 01:07:25,473
Why do you treat us             
like your little Einsteins ?    

798
01:07:26,809 --> 01:07:29,144
                    What do     
                    you mean ?  

799
01:07:29,211 --> 01:07:31,546
Did <i>your</i> parents                
ever send <i>you</i>                   

800
01:07:31,614 --> 01:07:33,882
To an enrichment                
program ?                       

801
01:07:35,551 --> 01:07:36,751
                    No.         

802
01:07:36,819 --> 01:07:39,320
C'mon, mom,                     
it's the <i>Summer.</i>                

803
01:07:39,388 --> 01:07:41,589
    Enjoy it !                  

804
01:07:48,130 --> 01:07:50,098
                You're right.   

805
01:07:50,166 --> 01:07:52,400
                You're right.   

806
01:07:52,468 --> 01:07:55,370
    I guess I'm just trying     
    to <i>rush</i> everything too much.

807
01:07:55,438 --> 01:07:58,606
    I'm trying to rush <i>you</i>      
    <i>into being little adults,</i>   

808
01:07:58,674 --> 01:08:01,609
    I'm rushing Roxanne         
    back to the wild.           

809
01:08:03,646 --> 01:08:06,981
Probably rushing <i>Terry</i> into     
I don't <i>know</i> what.              

810
01:08:07,049 --> 01:08:09,250
            Oh, no, mom,        

811
01:08:09,318 --> 01:08:11,886
            We'll take          

812
01:08:11,954 --> 01:08:13,855
        Some of the blame       
        for Terry.              

813
01:08:13,923 --> 01:08:16,057
        Actually, mom...        

814
01:08:18,194 --> 01:08:20,829
            We'll take          
            most of the blame.  

815
01:08:20,896 --> 01:08:23,231
( Judith )                      
alright,                        
all of the blame.               

816
01:08:24,233 --> 01:08:26,634
I was so close.                 

817
01:08:26,702 --> 01:08:28,470
I was so close                  

818
01:08:28,537 --> 01:08:31,706
To reintroducing                
Roxanne into a pod.             

819
01:08:32,842 --> 01:08:34,843
And then--                      

820
01:08:34,910 --> 01:08:37,112
                What happened   
                to Roxanne ?    

821
01:08:39,782 --> 01:08:41,416
She's gone.                     

822
01:08:41,484 --> 01:08:43,585
        She'll be back,         
        don't worry.            

823
01:08:43,652 --> 01:08:45,687
No, she won't.                  

824
01:08:45,754 --> 01:08:48,189
She misses Zeus                 
too much.                       

825
01:08:49,358 --> 01:08:51,059
Mom.                            

826
01:08:54,063 --> 01:08:55,396
            Zeus !              

827
01:08:56,966 --> 01:08:58,533
            Zeus !              

828
01:09:25,027 --> 01:09:26,828
    ( phone rings )             

829
01:09:27,363 --> 01:09:28,496
            Hello ?             

830
01:09:28,564 --> 01:09:29,864
            It's me.            

831
01:09:29,932 --> 01:09:31,799
                Yes ?           

832
01:09:31,867 --> 01:09:33,535
                I see.          

833
01:09:33,602 --> 01:09:35,637
                    ( Jordan )  
                    anything ?  

834
01:09:35,704 --> 01:09:38,039
        Nope, <i>nothing.</i>          

835
01:09:38,107 --> 01:09:40,108
        I just <i>know</i> he's        
        trying to go back.      

836
01:09:40,176 --> 01:09:42,377
            That is             
            unbelievable.       

837
01:09:42,444 --> 01:09:44,179
        That's like <i>scary.</i>      

838
01:09:44,246 --> 01:09:46,948
    I think it's time to take   
    Jurassic measures.          

839
01:09:47,016 --> 01:09:49,884
    I agree.                    
    What do we have to lose ?   

840
01:09:49,952 --> 01:09:53,154
Alright,                        
who is that ?                   

841
01:09:53,222 --> 01:09:54,822
                Hi.             

842
01:09:54,890 --> 01:09:57,992
            Can you please      
            hold on a second ?  

843
01:09:59,295 --> 01:10:00,895
                    Dad.        

844
01:10:00,963 --> 01:10:02,197
            It's for you, mom.  

845
01:10:02,264 --> 01:10:03,531
Who is it ?                     

846
01:10:03,599 --> 01:10:05,500
        It's Jane freeman       

847
01:10:05,568 --> 01:10:06,935
        From the                
        record company.         

848
01:10:07,002 --> 01:10:10,071
        It's somebody selling   
        cemetery plots.         

849
01:10:11,507 --> 01:10:13,374
            Mom, get the phone. 
        Hello ?                 

850
01:10:13,442 --> 01:10:15,777
            Hello, gorgeous.    

851
01:10:15,844 --> 01:10:17,779
        I had a dream about <i>you</i> 
        <i>last night.</i>             

852
01:10:17,846 --> 01:10:19,013
                    You did ?   

853
01:10:19,081 --> 01:10:20,748
                    Oh, yeah.   

854
01:10:20,816 --> 01:10:22,750
        We went all the way,    
        positively platinum.    

855
01:10:22,818 --> 01:10:24,619
                    Oh.         

856
01:10:24,687 --> 01:10:27,188
        I had a dream about     
        you too last night      

857
01:10:27,256 --> 01:10:29,591
        And we went             
        resoundingly tin.       

858
01:10:31,193 --> 01:10:33,294
            Hello, Terry.       

859
01:10:35,531 --> 01:10:38,066
        They don't give up      
        too easily, do they ?   

860
01:10:38,133 --> 01:10:39,701
        No, they <i>do</i> not.        

861
01:10:42,705 --> 01:10:44,505
        I heard about Zeus.     

862
01:10:44,573 --> 01:10:47,275
            I heard             
            about Roxanne.      

863
01:10:49,745 --> 01:10:51,946
            She's pretty hurt.  

864
01:10:59,088 --> 01:11:00,922
                So is he.       

865
01:11:00,990 --> 01:11:03,591
        I mean, I think         
        she'll get over it.     

866
01:11:03,659 --> 01:11:05,293
                Maybe...        

867
01:11:06,562 --> 01:11:09,464
        We can give it          
        a little more time.     

868
01:11:10,432 --> 01:11:12,300
                We'll talk.     

869
01:11:12,368 --> 01:11:13,768
                Yeah.           

870
01:11:14,436 --> 01:11:15,870
                Tomorrow ?      

871
01:11:15,938 --> 01:11:17,605
                Yeah.           

872
01:11:17,673 --> 01:11:20,174
            Yeah, tomorrow      
            would be great.     

873
01:11:20,776 --> 01:11:22,076
                Alright.        

874
01:11:22,144 --> 01:11:23,177
                        Okay.   

875
01:11:23,245 --> 01:11:24,846
                Bye.            

876
01:11:24,913 --> 01:11:26,014
                    Bye.        

877
01:11:26,715 --> 01:11:27,815
                Hello ?         

878
01:11:27,883 --> 01:11:30,285
        Hello ?                 

879
01:11:30,352 --> 01:11:31,352
        Goodbye.                

880
01:11:31,420 --> 01:11:33,521
            Okay, bye.          

881
01:11:35,424 --> 01:11:36,691
        Hello.                  

882
01:11:38,227 --> 01:11:40,395
            Alright,            
            you hang up first.  

883
01:11:40,462 --> 01:11:41,729
                Mm-mm.          

884
01:11:41,797 --> 01:11:44,299
            How 'bout we        
            hang up together ?  

885
01:11:44,366 --> 01:11:46,067
            I'll say bye        

886
01:11:46,135 --> 01:11:47,802
        And on one, two, three, 
        we hang up.             

887
01:11:47,870 --> 01:11:49,771
                Okay, bye.      

888

                One, two,       

889
01:11:51,073 --> 01:11:52,473
                    Three.      

890
01:11:55,177 --> 01:11:57,178

892
01:11:58,547 --> 01:12:00,815
            She hung up on me.  

893
01:12:05,154 --> 01:12:06,654
            Breakfast.          

894
01:12:44,860 --> 01:12:46,494
            Jordy !             

895
01:12:46,562 --> 01:12:49,430
I woke up and                   
I wanna smell the coffee !      

896
01:12:50,232 --> 01:12:51,733
    Jordy ?                     

897
01:13:03,078 --> 01:13:04,879
    ( Jordan )                  
    hi, dad, it's me.           

898
01:13:04,947 --> 01:13:07,615
    I've gone to                
    look for Zeus.              

899
01:13:11,286 --> 01:13:12,854
    Hi, dad, it's me.           

900
01:13:12,921 --> 01:13:14,522
    I've gone to                
    look for Zeus.

    of passengers...            

903
01:13:19,128 --> 01:13:20,628
        Oh, <i>shoot.</i>

905
01:13:27,903 --> 01:13:29,003
    Hello.                      

906
01:13:29,071 --> 01:13:30,571
        Mary Beth,              
        it's Becky.             

907
01:13:30,639 --> 01:13:33,441
I know it's Sunday but I thought
you should know about this.     

908
01:13:33,509 --> 01:13:34,776
    Know what ?                 

909
01:13:34,843 --> 01:13:38,012
I came to the office to         
check up on a few things and--  

910
01:13:38,080 --> 01:13:40,114
    And <i>what,</i> Becky ?           

911

                Claude carver   
                was just in.    

912
01:13:42,818 --> 01:13:45,319
    He said they found a dolphin
    caught in drift nets...     

913
01:13:45,387 --> 01:13:47,989
                        Dead.   

914
01:13:48,056 --> 01:13:50,425
            It's not Roxanne.   

915
01:13:50,492 --> 01:13:53,261
I've gotta                      
find her, Becky.                

916
01:14:28,464 --> 01:14:29,530
            Right.              

917
01:14:29,598 --> 01:14:31,732
            No more             
            Mr. Nice guy.       

918
01:14:35,504 --> 01:14:37,705
            Look who's back.    

919
01:14:37,773 --> 01:14:40,341
        Now Roxanne             
        is ours.                

920
01:14:40,409 --> 01:14:41,943
No, Dr. Carver.                 

921
01:14:42,010 --> 01:14:43,177
Yours.                          

922
01:14:43,245 --> 01:14:44,779
                    We quit.    

923
01:14:45,714 --> 01:14:47,748
        No, you don't.          

924
01:14:47,816 --> 01:14:50,084
        You're <i>fired</i> !          

925
01:14:50,152 --> 01:14:52,286
    We got a date               
    with a dolphin.             

926
01:15:05,334 --> 01:15:07,602
Excuse me, sir !                

927
01:15:07,669 --> 01:15:10,538
How would you like to be part   
of scientific history ?!        

928
01:15:14,142 --> 01:15:17,144
Can I interest you              
in a case of rum ?              

929
01:15:23,852 --> 01:15:25,720
Enjoy your flight.              

930
01:15:26,922 --> 01:15:28,890
Next in line.                   

931
01:15:28,957 --> 01:15:32,326
            ( Jordan )          
            do you have         
            standby ?           

932
01:15:36,231 --> 01:15:37,265
What ?                          

933
01:15:37,332 --> 01:15:39,534
            Do you have         
            standby ?           

934
01:15:39,601 --> 01:15:43,538
And do you have a good reason   
for being here ?                

935
01:15:43,605 --> 01:15:45,573
        Uh-oh.                  

936
01:16:08,430 --> 01:16:11,265
            Take us to 0-3-5    
            full throttle !     

937
01:16:11,333 --> 01:16:14,702
        This mongrel            
        is the perfect bait !   

938
01:16:14,770 --> 01:16:17,038
            Roxanne will        
            come to <i>us</i> !        

939
01:16:29,985 --> 01:16:31,252
        ( beeping )             

940
01:16:32,888 --> 01:16:33,955
            Yes !               

941
01:16:34,022 --> 01:16:36,190
        We got her !            

942
01:16:36,892 --> 01:16:39,126
        Ah, my foot !           

943
01:16:47,469 --> 01:16:49,136
You know, Jordy,                

944
01:16:49,204 --> 01:16:51,839
We're gonna do everything       
we can to find Zeus             

945
01:16:51,907 --> 01:16:54,208
But it's extremely unlikely     
he made it down here.           

946
01:16:54,276 --> 01:16:55,443
                Dad,            

947
01:16:55,510 --> 01:16:58,846
        Zeus is an              
        extremely extreme dog.  

948
01:16:58,914 --> 01:17:00,481
                That he is.     

949
01:17:00,549 --> 01:17:02,617
    ( Jordan )                  
    he's also in love.          

950
01:17:02,684 --> 01:17:05,119
        ( Terry )               
        an extreme emotion.     

951
01:17:06,788 --> 01:17:09,156
        Why don't you           
        try it sometime, dad ?  

952
01:17:22,504 --> 01:17:24,138
It's okay.                      

953
01:17:31,313 --> 01:17:33,080
    ( Judith )                  
    Jordan !                    

954
01:17:33,148 --> 01:17:34,882
    Jordan !                    

955
01:17:34,950 --> 01:17:36,183
        C'mon !                 

956
01:17:36,251 --> 01:17:38,319
Cab's waiting.                  
Let's go.                       

957
01:17:38,387 --> 01:17:40,488
            Mind if I           
            tag along ?         

958
01:17:40,555 --> 01:17:41,555
    C'mon !                     

959
01:18:07,783 --> 01:18:09,016
                Becky.          

960
01:18:09,084 --> 01:18:11,952
        There's something       
        you should know.        

961
01:18:12,020 --> 01:18:14,021
                It's about      
                Dr. Carver.     

962
01:19:06,141 --> 01:19:07,608
            Hey, girls,         
            Terry,              

963
01:19:07,676 --> 01:19:09,543
            What are you        
            guys doing here ?   

964
01:19:09,611 --> 01:19:11,645
Where's my mom ?                
Her boat's gone.                

965
01:19:11,713 --> 01:19:14,315
        She's out               
        looking for Roxanne.    

966
01:19:29,364 --> 01:19:31,766
    C'mon, Roxanne.             

967
01:19:54,156 --> 01:19:55,956
Ready the net.                  

968
01:20:11,540 --> 01:20:13,641
            ( Zeus barking )    

969
01:20:24,586 --> 01:20:26,253
                Ready...        

970
01:20:26,321 --> 01:20:27,488
                Now !           

971
01:20:29,291 --> 01:20:31,091
                You missed,     
                you idiot !     

972
01:20:31,159 --> 01:20:32,493
            Get it back up !    

973
01:20:32,561 --> 01:20:34,328
        Get it up, fool !       

974
01:20:34,396 --> 01:20:36,230
        C'mon, move, move !     

975
01:21:07,329 --> 01:21:09,563
Get me out !                    

976
01:21:11,766 --> 01:21:14,034
You stupid dog.                 

977
01:23:27,102 --> 01:23:28,369
Mom ?                           

978
01:23:28,436 --> 01:23:29,570
                Mom !           

979
01:23:30,739 --> 01:23:32,539
            ( Nora )            
            mom !               

980
01:23:32,607 --> 01:23:33,774
    Mom !                       

981
01:23:35,910 --> 01:23:38,245
        ( Jordan )              
        flags up,               
        she's down in the sub.  

982
01:23:38,313 --> 01:23:40,114
            How long can she    
            stay down there ?   

983
01:23:40,181 --> 01:23:42,483
        45 minutes              
        I think.                

984
01:24:03,805 --> 01:24:05,039
        Roxanne.                

985
01:24:05,106 --> 01:24:06,373
        Roxanne.                

986
01:24:07,609 --> 01:24:10,077
    ( Mary Beth )               
    yes, Roxanne.               

987
01:24:47,882 --> 01:24:50,451
I think she wants you           
to follow her.                  

988
01:26:04,025 --> 01:26:05,726
Get me a knife !                

989
01:27:42,657 --> 01:27:44,291
            You okay ?          

990
01:27:44,359 --> 01:27:45,659
            Roxanne.            

991
01:27:49,230 --> 01:27:51,198
    ( Jordan )                  
    c'mon !                     

992
01:27:51,266 --> 01:27:53,533
( Claude )                      
good dog,                       
yes, yes,                       

993
01:27:53,601 --> 01:27:56,270
That's a good dog.              

994
01:27:57,905 --> 01:27:59,273
    No !                        

995
01:28:00,208 --> 01:28:03,010
( Claude )                      
you mongrel !                   

996
01:28:05,313 --> 01:28:07,447
Stay, stay.                     

997
01:28:07,515 --> 01:28:10,083
What are you doing ?            
No, no, no !                    

998
01:28:22,697 --> 01:28:25,332
            Officer,            
            arrest this dog !   

999
01:28:25,400 --> 01:28:28,835
        Oh, we will.            

1000
01:28:28,903 --> 01:28:31,672
    Free Dr. Carver,            
    and then arrest him.        

1001
01:28:31,739 --> 01:28:34,875
I confess,                      
it was all him !                

1002
01:28:34,942 --> 01:28:37,344
    What are you talking about, 
    you idiot ?!                

1003
01:28:37,412 --> 01:28:39,880
            I'll kill you !     

1004
01:28:46,954 --> 01:28:48,955
    Atta boy, Zeus.             

1005
01:28:57,131 --> 01:28:59,099
( man across street )           
I'm waiting !                   

1006
01:28:59,167 --> 01:29:00,967
    How do you like             
    your new neighbors ?        

1007
01:29:01,035 --> 01:29:03,070
            I liked the         
            old ones better.    

1008
01:29:04,005 --> 01:29:06,406
            I'm gonna           
            take a shower.      

1009
01:29:06,474 --> 01:29:08,975
I'm gonna                       
make some coffee.               

1010
01:29:12,280 --> 01:29:15,082
Don't do that                   
again, okay ?                   

1011
01:29:40,675 --> 01:29:43,744
    We believe that with        
    all that's happened         

1012
01:29:43,811 --> 01:29:45,746
        It's clearly            
        established that        

1013
01:29:45,813 --> 01:29:48,014
        You <i>do </i>                 
        <i>like our mom.</i>           

1014
01:29:48,082 --> 01:29:50,650
Of course I do.                 

1015
01:29:50,718 --> 01:29:53,520
        Enough to <i>marry</i> her ?   

1016
01:29:56,290 --> 01:29:58,859
                How 'bout       
                next Sunday ?   

1017
01:30:10,004 --> 01:30:12,072
Where do you                    
keep the coffee ?               

1018
01:30:26,354 --> 01:30:28,422
    At this point,              
    if there's anyone here      

1019
01:30:28,489 --> 01:30:31,024
    That has any reason         
    that this marriage          

1020
01:30:31,092 --> 01:30:33,527
Between Mary Beth Dunhill       
and Terrence Paul Barnett       

1021
01:30:33,594 --> 01:30:35,562
Shall not                       
take place,                     

1022
01:30:35,630 --> 01:30:39,766
Speak now or forever            
hold your peace.                

1023
01:30:39,834 --> 01:30:41,868
                        ( man ) 
                        wait !  

1024
01:30:41,936 --> 01:30:43,870
                Wait !          

1025
01:30:43,938 --> 01:30:47,107
    Sorry, they told me to bring
    this down here right away.  

1026
01:30:47,175 --> 01:30:49,042
Better offer ?                  

1027
01:30:51,279 --> 01:30:53,480
        It's the grant !        

1028
01:30:53,548 --> 01:30:54,981
        ( Jordan )              
        good going, Mary Beth--

What's going on ?
