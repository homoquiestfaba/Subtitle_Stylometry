1
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:00,080
Musa!

2
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:03,560
I've told you before,

3
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:05,280
you can honor your mother

4
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:07,400
by doing your chores,

5
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,680
not sitting by her grave.

6
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:14,720
Musa!

7
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:17,520
Come and help me with your father.

8
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,160
Yes, Grandmother

9
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:52,760
Khalazome, you are so funny.

10
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:55,320
Musa! Come now!

11
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:57,880
At least I have you girl.

12
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:22,600
Is the Sangoma here to heal father?

13
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:24,960
If she can.

14
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:29,080
Musa go and see if your father is thirsty,

15
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:31,760
maybe he will eat.

16
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:51,200
The witchcraft plaguing
Ayize is getting worse.

17
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:54,520
I have told you, the family is cursed.

18
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:57,120
Majola's wife,

19
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,760
then Bheki and his wife,

20
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:02,440
Ayize's wife and their baby, all have died.

21
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:05,680
Now Ayize suffers.

22
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:08,680
But Ayize respected his ancestors

23
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:10,800
and followed tradition.

24
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:15,480
He took his brother's wife
when Bheki passed on.

25
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:19,360
It is a curse.

26
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,440
I beg you, give me strong muthi for Ayize

27
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:27,480
and bring an end to this evil.

28
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:30,680
Praise to the ancestors.

29
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:13,040
Under the blanket.

30
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:33,480
I made it for you, my son.

31
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:42,520
I saved it for when we are happy,
for a time when we celebrate our ancestors,

32
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:49,120
but I want you to have it now.

33
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:02,600
Guide us ancestors.

34
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:05,760
Praise to the spirits.

35
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:09,160
Ayize has neglected an ancestor,

36
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:12,640
a female ancestor, his grandmother.

37
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:15,680
She demands a sacrifice.

38
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:19,640
Quickly, while there is still time.

39
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:30,080
Musa my son, you are now a man.

40
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:41,200
What can I do, father?

41
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:49,720
You must be strong now...
in the way of a man, Musa.

42
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:53,840
I will do that, Father.

43
00:08:55,680 --> 00:09:07,040
Majola... if only he were here,
he would help you.

44
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:30,920
Musa, go find your cousin,

45
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:33,760
she's late coming home from school.

46
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:37,960
Yes, grandmother.

47
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:30,800
Get away, your family is bewitched!

48
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,160
No, that's not true!

49
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:34,680
You're cursed. Everyone knows it!

50
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:36,240
No, that's not true.

51
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:37,280
The elders must drive you out!

52
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:38,360
You're bringing a bad plague!

53
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:40,680
Go away!

54
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:58,600
Get away!

55
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:17,880
What do you want?

56
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:22,200
I came to look for my cousin, Thandi.

57
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:24,720
At the school you will speak English.

58
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:29,240
I came to look for my cousin, Thandi.

59
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:31,560
She had to stay after school.

60
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:36,720
Musa, why were you not in school today?

61
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:43,120
My grandmother needs help with my father,
he is very sick.

62
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:49,400
Why so many people
in the village getting sick?

63
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:51,520
Is it really a curse?

64
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:55,600
A disease, a curse, who knows?

65
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:58,480
It is the same in other villages.

66
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:01,920
We should not talk about it,

67
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:03,480
it only makes it worst.

68
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:11,240
Thandi, you did much better today,

69
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:13,720
your grade will improve.

70
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:58,680
Thandi, what happened?
Why did you have to stay after school?

71
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:02,200
Is something wrong?

72
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:04,040
I want my father.

73
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:07,840
You know is working.

74
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:11,000
I don't care! I want my father.

75
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:13,960
He'll come home one day.

76
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:20,720
Come on, grandmother is waiting.

77
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:34,800
The boy will be back soon.

78
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:38,360
If the sacrifice is necessary,
we must do it now.

79
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:40,720
There is no choice.

80
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:44,160
It may already be too late
to appease Ayize's ancestors.

81
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:51,760
Then do it now.

82
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:32,960
Why are you killing
your children with illness?

83
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:37,600
When they are all dead,
who will look after you?

84
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:49,560
Here... Take what we are giving,

85
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,760
and in return give us luck... and life!

86
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:23,240
Khalazome!

87
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:57,680
I see you, boy. What is it now?

88
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:05,520
Grandmother,
father said that I am to act as a man now,

89
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:08,760
And so you should.

90
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:15,400
I've been thinking of going to the city
to find work.

91
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,560
To earn money so we can buy another cow.

92
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:26,600
The city is very far,
too far for a boy to go.

93
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:31,560
I could find Uncle Majola.

94
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:35,400
Father said he would help us.

95
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:38,520
Do you know where it is?

96
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:43,320
He went to Johannesburg.
He went in the big truck.

97
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:48,280
I'll go to Jo'burg then.
I will find Uncle Majola.

98
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:57,320
Grandmother may I have
your permission and blessings?

99
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:02,160
Yes you have my blessings.

100
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:06,440
Find your uncle.

101
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:08,560
Get us money for a cow.

102
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:26,840
If you keep this
on until it falls off by itself,

103
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:29,280
something good will happen.

104
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:41,360
Musa, please find my father.

105
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:48,240
I will Thandi. I promise.

106
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:59,720
With this may my journey bring success.

107
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:17,760
Hello baby!

108
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:27,200
Ah look at this, what have we got here?

109
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:30,240
Little kid

110
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:35,160
Boohoo little kid.
Hey baby where do you come from?

111
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:42,160
No man, they scored three goals
in the last five minutes.

112
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:45,560
Another beer?

113
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:49,360
No man, I'm going to drive.
I'm hitting the road, I cannot drink.

114
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:52,680
You must be safe these days heeein!

115
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:06,320
Mister, could you please
take me to Johannesburg?

116
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:10,840
I won't be any trouble.

117
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:11,520
What are you up to?

118
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:13,040
Don't bother my customers!

119
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:18,960
Did you hear me?
I said get out of here! Ham ba!

120
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:21,400
Hey watch it!

121
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:32,760
Why not?

122
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:44,480
Darling, you're just going to love it...

123
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:36,560
Thank you baby!

124
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:17,640
You!

125
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:20,080
What do you think you're doing in my truck?

126
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:22,000
You could get killed there man.

127
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:27,760
Come on get off my truck.
Mfan ngithe phumala. Manje. Come on

128
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:51,400
Wait! Wait! Wait!

129
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:56,800
Wait!

130
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:15,400
Hey! What now!

131
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:17,680
My drum, I left it in your truck.

132
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:24,480
Here!

133
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:36,360
Get in.

134
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:19,920
Have you ever been
outside your village boy?

135
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:24,280
I bet you've never been
inside a truck before.

136
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:35,040
What's your name? What's your name?

137
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:37,920
Musa.

138
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:43,440
Me namo Nobe, Nobe Lebese.

139
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:49,160
Why in the world do you want
to be in Johannesburg?

140
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:55,120
Hey I'm talking to you!

141
00:28:57,720 --> 00:28:59,080
To find my uncle,

142
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:03,440
and to earn some money
to buy gogo a new cow.

143
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:10,160
To buy your grandmother a cow, hahahaha...

144
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:15,560
Where is your uncle?

145
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:19,960
Gogo said he works in the city.

146
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:23,280
What's his name?

147
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:28,320
Uncle Majola. Majola Mkhize

148
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:33,520
from our umuzy, in KwaZulu-Natal.

149
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:43,040
Musa, I want you to listen to me,

150
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:47,840
you're going to see many things
in the city

151
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:51,480
things that could catch your attention,

152
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:57,440
things that could get you killed,

153
00:29:57,720 --> 00:29:59,560
things that could bewitch you.

154
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:02,880
Things that you should stay away from.

155
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:06,000
You hear me?

156
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:16,800
Yeah well, I just wanted you to be careful.

157
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:58,160
Go Ahead!

158
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:41,600
Jo'burg?

159
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:43,680
Yeah.

160
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:47,600
Big, hey?

161
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:20,720
Mr. Botha?

162
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:22,440
I need to speak with you about Suzanne.

163
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:23,760
- Yeah?
- In accounting,

164
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:24,800
Yeah?

165
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,880
Her car was hijacked
in the back parking lot, last night.

166
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:28,680
Don't tell me! Not again!

167
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:30,680
And one of our guards, the Major,

168
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,680
he was shot, he's critical.

169
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:35,920
These street gangs are out of control man.

170
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:38,400
I'd like to send them all straight to hell.

171
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:44,720
Botha!

172
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:47,720
Matlin look I'm trying to run
a transport business here man!

173
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:50,360
I need these trailers back on the road
by Monday, hein!

174
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:51,640
Okay great.

175
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:54,400
Sorry I'm late.

176
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:55,680
Here are your contracts.

177
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:58,320
Stefan I need you here man.

178
00:33:58,520 --> 00:33:59,560
Dad, we've been over this so many times.

179
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:02,240
I know, I know, but it is important
to have you here in the business,

180
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:04,200
we had another hijacking yesterday.

181
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:06,240
Yeah one of the security guard was shot,

182
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:08,360
these street kids are out of control man.

183
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:10,480
There is nowhere safe anymore

184
00:34:10,680 --> 00:34:11,960
It's not the street kids.

185
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:14,200
They may do the petty crimes
but don't hijack cars.

186
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:16,080
Look! I didn't pay for your legal studies

187
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:18,920
so you can waste your time
on all these sob stories man.

188
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:22,680
I got a whole load of work
for you to do here, you know,

189
00:34:23,240 --> 00:34:25,840
I mean, I got all these claim forms
that I need you to handle.

190
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:26,560
I can't dad,

191
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:28,920
I've got a filling deadline
on a zoning case.

192
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:34,160
I can't understand why you get yourself so
involved with this charity case non-sense.

193
00:34:34,680 --> 00:34:36,320
This is your business too, you know.

194
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:39,320
Look at you man!

195
00:34:41,160 --> 00:34:42,520
You look tired.

196
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:48,320
Looks like we have another
slow puncture over here?

197
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:49,480
Hey?

198
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:53,520
I don't think he is going to be
with us much longer!

199
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:57,440
Dad, I have to go.

200
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:06,960
Nobe!

201
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:08,560
Yes, sir.

202
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:10,640
I see you brought your son with you today.

203
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:14,120
No. He is not actually my son sir;

204
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:17,160
he is a boy from the village sir,
looking for work.

205
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:18,840
Get him out of here now!

206
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:23,680
- Maybe you could...
- Now! Run man, run...

207
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,320
Street kids, they are all criminals,

208
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:29,000
I don't want any around here.

209
00:35:57,040 --> 00:35:59,360
Hi baby, how are you?

210
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:32,800
Do you know Majola Mkhize?

211
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:36,560
Have you seen Majola Mkhize?

212
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:41,680
Do you know Majola Mkhize?

213
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:48,600
- Do you know Majola Mkhize?
- Narrr,

214
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,320
mfana you need big magic boy,

215
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:57,400
I have, have the best herbs and potions,
cure anything.

216
00:36:57,960 --> 00:37:00,720
You cure nothing; you just kill cows!

217
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:34,920
Papa, papa, papa.

218
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:41,000
Girls, yeyeya, How do you do?
Ahaha my little one.

219
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:44,760
So Emily, have you been helping
your mother to look after your sisters.

220
00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:47,360
Of course I have,
but they don't want to listen to me.

221
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:52,200
Heyeyey girls, you must listen to your
big sister and your mother right!

222
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:54,640
- Yes father.
- Right.

223
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:57,040
I thought you were not due 'til tomorrow.

224
00:37:57,480 --> 00:38:01,200
Are you not happy to see me? Come on...

225
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:09,480
Hey, what do we have here?

226
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:15,960
Yaya lana, this is our spot.

227
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:17,880
Get going if you know
what's good for you.

228
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:19,000
Where you from?

229
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:21,160
You aren't from Jozi.

230
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:24,520
I said where you from?

231
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:27,560
Ukhalamba Valley, KwaZulu.

232
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:31,560
A real life Zulu,
so you think you're tough.

233
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:33,880
You're going to fight all of us hein?

234
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:39,000
He doesn't have anything.

235
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:43,240
You can sleep here;

236
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,360
will find you when we need you.

237
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:49,960
But... you owe us! Uyaskolota mpinshi!

238
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:43,000
I'm the local Sangoma,

239
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:44,400
what are you telling these women?

240
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:46,040
The truth about the sickness.

241
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:49,040
Our people are suffering because
they don't follow our traditional ways.

242
00:39:49,240 --> 00:39:52,400
Mmmmm, some of them say
that if a man with AIDS

243
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:54,000
has sex with a virgin

244
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:55,440
he will be cured.

245
00:39:55,720 --> 00:39:56,840
That's not true.

246
00:39:58,040 --> 00:40:00,480
That's why so many
young girls are being raped.

247
00:40:01,080 --> 00:40:03,080
We have to stop the lies and the rumors.

248
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:04,800
Tell the people the truth.

249
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:08,760
Many Sangomas are helping us
educate the people.

250
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:10,840
I'm a sorry lady, I have to go.

251
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:14,960
Better keep a close
watch on your daughters.

252
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,240
What was all that about?

253
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:20,720
A health worker,

254
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:22,440
more talk about the sickness.

255
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:25,480
These people,

256
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:31,440
I'm tired of hearing about it man.

257
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:35,280
Tell me about your new route.

258
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:36,760
Why do you care?

259
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:39,480
I care, tell me.

260
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:43,760
Well, I picked up
a little Zulu boy yesterday.

261
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:45,720
A Zulu boy?

262
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:48,800
Yeah. He hid in the back of my truck,

263
00:40:49,640 --> 00:40:55,280
said he was coming to Johannesburg
to look for work, and to buy a cow.

264
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:56,440
A cow?

265
00:40:57,720 --> 00:40:59,840
You know there are a thousand like him
on the streets.

266
00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:03,440
It would be nice to have a son,
you know.

267
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:05,880
Nobe, I think we have tried enough.

268
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:08,680
Our children are our treasures.

269
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:11,480
Yes they are,
and it takes one to feed them,

270
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:13,280
you know that better than anyone!

271
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:19,800
What?

272
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:23,920
Nobe, you're on the road a lot.

273
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:26,640
Please don't bring this disease
into our family.

274
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:28,600
Well I'm not using any of those.

275
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:30,480
And I'm not explaining myself to you

276
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:32,240
or to any government worker.

277
00:41:33,120 --> 00:41:37,520
All this talk about condoms,
it is not natural,

278
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:41,840
maybe these condoms are the ones
that brings the sickness.

279
00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:43,560
You know that's not true.

280
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:45,600
You see, once I take my trousers off,

281
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,920
why do I have to put them on again?

282
00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:50,600
Besides, you can tell when one is it.

283
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:52,080
No you can't.

284
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:54,440
Your sister looked fine a few months ago.

285
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:56,040
Now look at her.

286
00:41:56,600 --> 00:41:59,760
Nobe promise me you aren't messing around,
promise me!

287
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:02,920
That's enough;
I'm not talking about it anymore.

288
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:04,040
Nobe. Please don't bring this dis...

289
00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:05,480
That's enough!

290
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:10,800
Why do you care after all these years?

291
00:42:27,080 --> 00:42:30,640
Hey stop pushing, stop pushing...
Careful, careful now!

292
00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:38,480
Hey that little one here.

293
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:48,840
Would you like some bred?

294
00:42:49,240 --> 00:42:50,040
Thank you.

295
00:42:51,160 --> 00:42:52,480
I haven't seen you before.

296
00:42:53,640 --> 00:42:55,080
I'm Francis, what's your name?

297
00:42:55,560 --> 00:42:56,400
Musa.

298
00:42:56,720 --> 00:42:59,520
I'm looking for my uncle, Majola Mkhize.

299
00:42:59,800 --> 00:43:00,680
Do you know him?

300
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:02,960
Sorry I don't.

301
00:43:49,600 --> 00:43:51,680
Yhea what's your name?

302
00:43:56,160 --> 00:43:58,000
Are you scared of me, what's your name?

303
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:00,720
Musa. What's your name?

304
00:44:00,920 --> 00:44:04,000
Me I'm Letti. But my friends call me "T".

305
00:44:05,240 --> 00:44:07,000
And then this popo what's up with that?

306
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:12,040
My father gave it to me, before he left us.

307
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:14,160
Oh so why did you come to Jozi then?

308
00:44:14,680 --> 00:44:17,360
To find ajob, and to find my uncle.

309
00:44:22,280 --> 00:44:24,360
You know what, watch this I'm going to
show you something, quick!

310
00:44:25,720 --> 00:44:27,120
This is the muthi market.

311
00:44:27,480 --> 00:44:31,560
The place where herbs and other ingredients
are sold for traditional medicine,

312
00:44:32,680 --> 00:44:34,320
for magic and for potions...

313
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:43,720
Musa? Do you want to learn
how to make some money?

314
00:44:44,280 --> 00:44:45,120
Enough for a cow?

315
00:44:45,320 --> 00:44:47,440
No! But enough to eat. Watch this out!

316
00:44:47,640 --> 00:44:48,600
It's okay to take pictures,

317
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:50,760
but please stay close to the vehicle.

318
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:52,280
Don't try to wonder off on your...

319
00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:55,000
- She's got my purse; she's got my purse.
- Hey come back here.

320
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:56,240
You stupid girl!

321
00:44:58,080 --> 00:45:00,360
I'll bite you for AIDS! I'll bite you!

322
00:45:00,560 --> 00:45:02,000
Augh! Get away!

323
00:45:07,360 --> 00:45:08,040
You've got to be fast,

324
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:09,840
before they have time to check you out.

325
00:45:10,200 --> 00:45:11,120
Here take this.

326
00:45:11,320 --> 00:45:11,960
No, you stole it!

327
00:45:12,160 --> 00:45:13,160
Ah Musa don't be stupid man,

328
00:45:13,360 --> 00:45:14,280
you have to steal to survive,

329
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:15,880
the sooner you learn that the better.

330
00:45:16,080 --> 00:45:17,600
One Rand rinse and wipe!

331
00:45:27,320 --> 00:45:29,600
Thank you my brother.

332
00:46:15,360 --> 00:46:16,720
Thanks, thanks...

333
00:46:19,320 --> 00:46:22,480
Hey! Move man this is my spot.

334
00:47:13,600 --> 00:47:14,560
Yes!

335
00:47:31,720 --> 00:47:33,040
Thanks, good job!

336
00:47:37,760 --> 00:47:39,280
See, you don't have to steal.

337
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:41,840
You're not going to get much
to eat with that.

338
00:47:42,440 --> 00:47:43,400
I will eat.

339
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:46,120
And I'm looking for my uncle,
through every window.

340
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:48,040
Musa do you really think

341
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:52,280
you're going to find your uncle in this
humengus city and even if you do?

342
00:47:52,640 --> 00:47:53,800
Are you going to know him?

343
00:47:54,120 --> 00:47:58,640
Hey of course, he is my uncle.

344
00:48:13,720 --> 00:48:16,400
Ahhhh, leave me alone man.

345
00:48:23,640 --> 00:48:27,400
Well it's official,
approval from the council.

346
00:48:30,960 --> 00:48:32,680
At last, thank god,

347
00:48:34,760 --> 00:48:35,840
thank you Stefan.

348
00:48:36,120 --> 00:48:37,320
Hey, I just got the permit;

349
00:48:37,960 --> 00:48:40,040
you've got the tough job,
helping these kids.

350
00:48:40,840 --> 00:48:43,120
I'd just wish you
would reconsider and stay.

351
00:48:44,200 --> 00:48:45,920
You can use this office
for as long as you like.

352
00:48:46,360 --> 00:48:49,920
Thanks, but you're going to have kids
coming out of your ears,

353
00:48:50,560 --> 00:48:52,120
you're going to need
all the space you can get.

354
00:48:52,720 --> 00:48:54,280
We're going to miss you being underfoot.

355
00:48:56,680 --> 00:48:57,800
Is that what you call it?

356
00:48:58,520 --> 00:48:59,480
If you like.

357
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:04,000
Without you,

358
00:49:04,200 --> 00:49:07,000
I wouldn't have known what to do
or have the strength to do it.

359
00:49:08,120 --> 00:49:09,200
Yes, you would.

360
00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:14,720
I just whish my father would understand.

361
00:49:15,720 --> 00:49:17,280
He used to be first to lend a hand.

362
00:49:18,040 --> 00:49:19,000
What happened?

363
00:49:19,600 --> 00:49:20,720
I don't know exactly.

364
00:49:21,520 --> 00:49:23,200
All he cares about now is its business.

365
00:49:24,040 --> 00:49:25,120
It's his whole life.

366
00:49:25,760 --> 00:49:27,520
He is a lonely bitter old man.

367
00:49:31,040 --> 00:49:32,200
You have a fever, are you okay?

368
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:33,960
It's just a bit stuffy in here.

369
00:49:36,240 --> 00:49:37,840
I'm sorry to interrupt Francis,

370
00:49:38,200 --> 00:49:40,400
but there is a lot of people
waiting to see Stefan.

371
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:42,960
Go ahead,
I've got things to do in the kitchen.

372
00:49:46,280 --> 00:49:46,800
A wash sir?

373
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:47,960
No!

374
00:49:53,520 --> 00:49:55,760
Okay... A wash for a Rand, a wash sir?

375
00:49:59,240 --> 00:50:00,320
A wash for a Rand. I'm your man.

376
00:50:00,520 --> 00:50:03,880
A wash for a Rand. A wash for a Rand sir?

377
00:50:05,560 --> 00:50:06,800
A wash for a Rand Mam?

378
00:50:44,200 --> 00:50:46,160
I give up, I give up...

379
00:50:49,960 --> 00:50:50,920
Thank you sir.

380
00:50:58,160 --> 00:50:59,880
Uncle Majola? Is that you?

381
00:52:46,720 --> 00:52:48,840
Come here, you know you want it.

382
00:52:49,360 --> 00:52:50,360
Stop it Tyro!

383
00:52:55,720 --> 00:52:59,000
Stop it Tyro! Leave me alone!
Stop it Tyro man leave me alone!

384
00:52:59,440 --> 00:53:00,400
Stop!

385
00:53:00,720 --> 00:53:01,680
Leave her alone!

386
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:02,720
Musa?

387
00:53:02,920 --> 00:53:04,240
I'm getting tired of you little Zulu.

388
00:53:04,960 --> 00:53:06,840
Get the glue, get the glue. He is shocking.

389
00:53:21,120 --> 00:53:22,480
Take a sit anywhere.

390
00:53:25,880 --> 00:53:28,040
We're safe here, for now.

391
00:53:30,920 --> 00:53:32,360
I hate living under a bridge.

392
00:53:33,360 --> 00:53:34,800
It's better than being dead.

393
00:53:42,360 --> 00:53:44,040
How long have you lived here anyway?

394
00:53:44,880 --> 00:53:46,240
Since my mother died.

395
00:53:49,520 --> 00:53:51,600
My parents and my baby brother all died.

396
00:54:00,080 --> 00:54:02,120
Why did you tell that man you had AIDS?

397
00:54:02,920 --> 00:54:04,040
I just did that's all.

398
00:54:06,680 --> 00:54:07,840
What does it mean?

399
00:54:08,560 --> 00:54:10,200
Musa, don't be stupid,

400
00:54:10,400 --> 00:54:12,120
it's a disease that killing our people.

401
00:54:12,840 --> 00:54:15,080
The doctor told me about it
when my mom was sick.

402
00:54:18,400 --> 00:54:19,400
Do you have it?

403
00:54:19,600 --> 00:54:24,520
No, I just say it
so that men will leave me alone.

404
00:54:25,520 --> 00:54:27,720
I get scared when they look at me
in the streets.

405
00:54:30,200 --> 00:54:31,440
Let me show you something.

406
00:54:32,280 --> 00:54:35,880
See this bracelet?
It's my most special thing.

407
00:54:36,840 --> 00:54:38,760
The white stands for purity

408
00:54:39,440 --> 00:54:40,960
and the red stands for love.

409
00:54:42,320 --> 00:54:46,960
My mother made it for me when,
when she was sick.

410
00:54:48,760 --> 00:54:50,320
She made me promise that

411
00:54:50,560 --> 00:54:53,960
I would stay a virgin,
until I get married.

412
00:54:59,600 --> 00:55:02,560
I'd rather die than let any
of those sick man touch me.

413
00:55:04,640 --> 00:55:05,800
I'll protect you.

414
00:55:08,560 --> 00:55:10,240
I won't let anything happen to you.

415
00:55:16,760 --> 00:55:18,240
Before my mother got sick,

416
00:55:19,080 --> 00:55:20,680
she taught me how to pray.

417
00:55:23,120 --> 00:55:25,320
I'll pray for a new home
for the both of us.

418
00:55:26,760 --> 00:55:30,480
It will have as much food as we can eat,
and it will be safe,

419
00:55:31,280 --> 00:55:32,880
so we won't have to hide.

420
00:55:33,720 --> 00:55:35,720
Hum, that will be good.

421
00:55:36,600 --> 00:55:38,200
And it will have a place to play,

422
00:55:39,160 --> 00:55:41,720
like in the park, with swing.

423
00:55:42,160 --> 00:55:45,360
Yeah Musa,
it will have all these wonderful things.

424
00:55:48,400 --> 00:55:49,840
It'll be a new day.

425
00:55:51,880 --> 00:55:53,360
It will be a brand new day...

426
00:56:09,360 --> 00:56:13,800
Stefan? Stefan? Stefan? Stefan!

427
00:56:24,720 --> 00:56:26,280
Excuse-me, where is the men's ward?

428
00:56:26,480 --> 00:56:27,320
Down there.

429
00:56:41,640 --> 00:56:42,600
Mr. Botha?

430
00:56:43,760 --> 00:56:45,120
I'm Francis Siswana.

431
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:48,040
Stefan is been helping me at the orphanage.

432
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:53,120
What's wrong? It must be exhaustion.

433
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,120
Ek's hier Stefan, ek's hier,

434
00:57:05,480 --> 00:57:06,920
What is it? What's wrong?

435
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:12,600
When I finished U.C.T.,

436
00:57:14,600 --> 00:57:16,680
I found out I was HIV positive.

437
00:57:25,200 --> 00:57:26,800
But, but how?

438
00:57:28,200 --> 00:57:29,280
Does it matter?

439
00:57:42,160 --> 00:57:43,920
Nobody needs to know about this.

440
00:57:45,440 --> 00:57:46,440
You're better than all this,

441
00:57:46,640 --> 00:57:48,760
we, we're better than all this.

442
00:57:49,840 --> 00:57:50,800
I'm tired...

443
00:57:53,720 --> 00:57:57,960
Hello Stefan, I'm doctor Trube,
are you Stefan's father?

444
00:57:58,360 --> 00:57:59,080
Yeah.

445
00:57:59,400 --> 00:58:00,400
Can I have a word?

446
00:58:07,960 --> 00:58:10,280
Has anyone told you
what's wrong with your son?

447
00:58:12,720 --> 00:58:14,440
He says he's HIV positive.

448
00:58:14,640 --> 00:58:16,400
It's progressed further than that.

449
00:58:16,680 --> 00:58:18,000
He has AIDS.

450
00:58:19,120 --> 00:58:21,520
At the moment he's suffering
from a bacterial infection,

451
00:58:21,680 --> 00:58:24,120
and the next 24 hours
are going to be critical.

452
00:58:31,960 --> 00:58:32,880
Letti?

453
00:58:38,960 --> 00:58:40,360
Have you seen Letti?

454
00:58:49,960 --> 00:58:50,880
Have you seen T?

455
00:58:51,080 --> 00:58:51,920
No.

456
00:58:52,560 --> 00:58:53,520
Have you seen T?

457
00:58:54,440 --> 00:58:55,200
No.

458
00:59:05,680 --> 00:59:06,440
Letti!

459
00:59:44,400 --> 00:59:45,960
Tyro, stop! What are you doing?

460
00:59:47,240 --> 00:59:49,080
Letti is missing, I found her bracelet.

461
00:59:49,320 --> 00:59:50,800
Keep it! She's not going to need it again.

462
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:52,040
What have you done to her?

463
00:59:58,480 --> 00:59:59,600
I told you, he owes us.

464
01:00:35,720 --> 01:00:37,920
Hey Musa! Is that you?

465
01:00:38,920 --> 01:00:39,680
Nobe!

466
01:00:40,520 --> 01:00:43,000
Would you like to take
a ride up the road with me.

467
01:00:44,840 --> 01:00:46,080
I could use your help.

468
01:00:48,080 --> 01:00:50,880
Come on son, we'll get something to eat.

469
01:00:59,240 --> 01:01:00,320
Did you find your uncle?

470
01:01:03,120 --> 01:01:03,760
No.

471
01:01:06,120 --> 01:01:09,640
Are you hurt? What happened?

472
01:01:13,360 --> 01:01:15,400
I see, you still have your drum.

473
01:01:19,760 --> 01:01:21,360
Are you getting enough to eat?

474
01:01:27,120 --> 01:01:28,360
What's bothering you boy?

475
01:01:31,120 --> 01:01:36,320
My friend, Letti, she is missing.

476
01:01:38,760 --> 01:01:40,400
You never can tell about woman.

477
01:01:49,840 --> 01:01:51,600
How about the money for your cow?

478
01:01:53,400 --> 01:01:54,920
I've been washing car windows.

479
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:05,640
I had more, but it was stolen.

480
01:02:31,600 --> 01:02:33,920
Hi baby, hi...

481
01:02:50,480 --> 01:02:51,920
Tell me about your family.

482
01:02:54,360 --> 01:02:59,000
They all died except my grandmother
and some of my cousins.

483
01:03:00,920 --> 01:03:01,840
Sorry.

484
01:03:12,080 --> 01:03:13,960
People say our family is cursed,

485
01:03:15,480 --> 01:03:17,080
but I think it was the AIDS.

486
01:03:20,040 --> 01:03:21,360
Have you ever heard of it?

487
01:03:25,600 --> 01:03:27,360
It's all I hear these days.

488
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:43,560
Okay hold still.

489
01:03:52,480 --> 01:03:53,640
Bull!

490
01:03:57,200 --> 01:03:58,280
Snake!

491
01:04:00,560 --> 01:04:03,360
Lion! No, no, no, no, no, Elephant!

492
01:04:03,800 --> 01:04:04,400
Yeah.

493
01:04:05,200 --> 01:04:07,840
Hey who's there?

494
01:04:18,520 --> 01:04:23,160
They can steal you blind,
you've got to watch every second.

495
01:04:27,120 --> 01:04:30,600
Nobe, thanks for warning me,

496
01:04:31,440 --> 01:04:32,800
and for letting me come with you.

497
01:04:38,040 --> 01:04:40,560
Nobe! I thought I heard your voice.

498
01:04:40,880 --> 01:04:41,960
Hello, Joe.

499
01:04:42,320 --> 01:04:43,480
How have you been?

500
01:04:44,280 --> 01:04:46,960
Okay, so where you headed?

501
01:04:48,080 --> 01:04:49,360
Back to Jo'burg,

502
01:04:49,680 --> 01:04:51,240
if I don't get sidetracked.

503
01:04:51,840 --> 01:04:54,080
Oh! This is Musa

504
01:04:57,680 --> 01:05:02,280
Fresh. Hey,
one of those women wants to barter,

505
01:05:02,600 --> 01:05:04,840
you know, carry a load of crafts to Jozi,

506
01:05:05,080 --> 01:05:06,600
and then she'll give me a good time.

507
01:05:06,800 --> 01:05:07,960
That sounds like a good deal?

508
01:05:09,400 --> 01:05:10,360
I don't know Joe.

509
01:05:10,560 --> 01:05:11,280
Huun?

510
01:05:11,520 --> 01:05:12,720
They say it could kill you.

511
01:05:13,040 --> 01:05:15,080
Arrg, we're all going to die,

512
01:05:15,280 --> 01:05:16,520
what difference does it make?

513
01:05:17,040 --> 01:05:20,000
Besides,
if some bitch gives me that disease,

514
01:05:20,280 --> 01:05:22,120
I'll give it to every woman that I know,

515
01:05:22,400 --> 01:05:23,600
they'll die with me.

516
01:05:25,440 --> 01:05:26,640
That's a fact.

517
01:05:31,200 --> 01:05:33,800
Guys, I've got some business;
see you later.

518
01:05:53,160 --> 01:05:54,280
Musa...

519
01:05:54,520 --> 01:05:55,800
Yeah, Nobe.

520
01:05:58,720 --> 01:06:00,280
Thanks for coming with me.

521
01:06:06,040 --> 01:06:10,360
Mr. Botha, come and look

522
01:06:19,120 --> 01:06:20,720
They're here for Stefan.

523
01:06:22,760 --> 01:06:24,840
He's helped so many, your son.

524
01:06:27,120 --> 01:06:29,560
He told me that's
what you taught him to do.

525
01:06:47,320 --> 01:06:48,400
Wake-up sleepy!

526
01:06:51,120 --> 01:06:53,320
I cut, you choose!

527
01:07:00,400 --> 01:07:02,200
You took the smaller piece.

528
01:07:03,360 --> 01:07:04,840
I'm the smaller man.

529
01:08:03,920 --> 01:08:06,360
Ahh! Good boy!

530
01:08:08,400 --> 01:08:09,760
Good work, it's empty hein!

531
01:08:10,480 --> 01:08:11,840
Let's see,

532
01:08:16,240 --> 01:08:17,600
we've got one more stop.

533
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:19,720
One more?

534
01:08:20,280 --> 01:08:21,040
Let's go.

535
01:08:34,480 --> 01:08:37,000
Mr. Botha, I'm sorry

536
01:08:37,200 --> 01:08:40,720
but Stefan is not responding in the way
that we'd hoped.

537
01:08:57,040 --> 01:08:57,960
Hey, stop!

538
01:08:58,840 --> 01:08:59,680
What?

539
01:09:00,080 --> 01:09:01,160
I know where we are.

540
01:09:04,920 --> 01:09:06,240
Are you taking me home?

541
01:09:07,600 --> 01:09:08,680
I can't go home,

542
01:09:10,840 --> 01:09:12,440
I haven't found my uncle,

543
01:09:13,480 --> 01:09:14,920
and I don't have a cow.

544
01:09:15,560 --> 01:09:17,280
You can go for a visit,

545
01:09:17,480 --> 01:09:18,440
you don't have to stay.

546
01:09:21,920 --> 01:09:24,560
Okay, I visit.

547
01:10:18,600 --> 01:10:21,160
This is isivane, to show respect.

548
01:10:26,720 --> 01:10:27,440
Okay.

549
01:10:31,040 --> 01:10:31,880
Let's go

550
01:11:31,320 --> 01:11:36,320
Musa I didn't know what happened to you.

551
01:11:37,040 --> 01:11:47,480
Grandmother, this man, a good friend
of mine, has the name Nobe Lebese.

552
01:11:49,240 --> 01:11:52,040
You are welcome in this house.

553
01:11:54,080 --> 01:11:56,800
We will prepare food and drink.

554
01:11:58,640 --> 01:11:59,640
Please sit down.

555
01:12:02,800 --> 01:12:07,440
Ngiyabonga mama, you don't have to go
to the trouble for me.

556
01:12:08,920 --> 01:12:10,480
Water will be fine.

557
01:12:11,680 --> 01:12:14,960
BaNobe gave me a ride to the city
with his truck.

558
01:12:16,680 --> 01:12:18,680
Siyabonga for watching out for him.

559
01:12:21,360 --> 01:12:24,360
Where is your uncle? Did you find Majola?

560
01:12:25,840 --> 01:12:27,280
Not yet Gogo.

561
01:12:35,160 --> 01:12:38,520
But I've been working
and earned money

562
01:12:39,720 --> 01:12:47,560
This is for you, towards a new cow,
like Khalazome

563
01:12:51,840 --> 01:12:53,240
You've done a great thing.

564
01:12:54,240 --> 01:12:56,640
Mama, you've dropped some.

565
01:13:06,680 --> 01:13:09,080
You should get a good cow.

566
01:13:11,080 --> 01:13:13,160
Your grandson has done well.

567
01:13:22,320 --> 01:13:23,560
How is school Thandi.

568
01:13:24,280 --> 01:13:26,440
The teacher had to go to the hospital.

569
01:13:27,240 --> 01:13:28,680
They say he's going to die.

570
01:13:33,800 --> 01:13:35,240
The curse is killing us all.

571
01:13:41,240 --> 01:13:47,960
Grandmother, may I go see the chief Elder?

572
01:13:48,840 --> 01:13:51,960
The chief Elder,
you know you can't see him.

573
01:13:52,640 --> 01:13:55,560
But I want to try, may I go.

574
01:13:56,000 --> 01:14:00,400
Does a man ask permission for such things?
Go!

575
01:14:06,800 --> 01:14:08,600
Do you have sons?

576
01:14:10,080 --> 01:14:11,440
Four daughters.

577
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:16,920
I thought I would be taken care
of my old age,

578
01:14:17,440 --> 01:14:19,280
but my children are gone.

579
01:14:19,920 --> 01:14:24,440
The burden has fallen on me
to take care of the little ones.

580
01:14:26,680 --> 01:14:29,520
I understand, I'm sorry.

581
01:14:30,640 --> 01:14:33,080
There is no work, no cattle,

582
01:14:33,280 --> 01:14:35,880
no hope for a little boy like Musa.

583
01:14:39,440 --> 01:14:44,720
Your grandson is a good boy.

584
01:14:46,040 --> 01:14:48,560
I think he'll make his way in the world.

585
01:15:01,720 --> 01:15:02,920
I see you.

586
01:15:03,320 --> 01:15:04,720
Yes, I see you, Father.

587
01:15:05,640 --> 01:15:08,520
Who is this who wishes to speak to me?

588
01:15:09,160 --> 01:15:12,800
It is me, Musa, son of Ayize,
whom you see.

589
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:14,880
May I enter and speak, Father?

590
01:15:54,480 --> 01:15:58,720
Go away boy, you shouldn't be here.

591
01:16:04,600 --> 01:16:08,520
Son of Ayize, why are you such a nuisance?

592
01:16:13,080 --> 01:16:20,520
My Lord, my teacher wouldn't speak
of the thing that is hurting our people.

593
01:16:21,440 --> 01:16:23,840
Now I come to you.

594
01:16:25,240 --> 01:16:28,040
What is it you speak about?

595
01:16:29,640 --> 01:16:31,360
I've been to the city.

596
01:16:32,360 --> 01:16:35,840
I've learned what is making
our people sick.

597
01:16:45,720 --> 01:16:50,000
You are brave to travel to the city.

598
01:16:50,720 --> 01:16:53,440
Braver still to come back.

599
01:16:55,040 --> 01:16:57,640
What is this witchcraft of which you speak?

600
01:17:00,080 --> 01:17:01,280
It's called AIDS.

601
01:17:02,880 --> 01:17:05,400
There are ways to prevent it.

602
01:17:07,280 --> 01:17:09,000
We must tell the people.

603
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:17,280
The people have heard about this,

604
01:17:18,320 --> 01:17:20,720
but they won't speak of it.

605
01:17:21,040 --> 01:17:22,920
They fear it

606
01:17:23,360 --> 01:17:27,120
It's a disease, my Lord, not magic.

607
01:17:29,040 --> 01:17:34,480
We have followed our tradition
and sacrificed for the ancestors.

608
01:17:34,920 --> 01:17:35,840
What more can we do?

609
01:17:38,920 --> 01:17:41,000
Tell our people the truth, my lord.

610
01:17:42,720 --> 01:17:50,600
Leave me my boy. Leave me.

611
01:19:12,800 --> 01:19:14,600
The boy would make a fine son.

612
01:19:15,120 --> 01:19:17,320
But he is your grandson, mama.

613
01:19:18,080 --> 01:19:20,600
His grandmother past away
before he was born.

614
01:19:22,520 --> 01:19:26,240
Just as it is custom
that you call me mama,

615
01:19:26,640 --> 01:19:28,720
the boy calls me grandmother.

616
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:33,240
But all these children?

617
01:19:34,640 --> 01:19:36,400
Some his cousins,

618
01:19:36,640 --> 01:19:38,600
some grandchildren of my own.

619
01:19:39,160 --> 01:19:42,480
I can no longer bear the burden
of raising one more child.

620
01:19:43,280 --> 01:19:45,240
Please, take him.

621
01:19:58,920 --> 01:20:02,400
Grandmother, it is time for us to go now.

622
01:20:03,880 --> 01:20:06,360
Nobe and I have to go back
to work in the city.

623
01:20:10,640 --> 01:20:12,600
A man must do his work.

624
01:20:18,520 --> 01:20:22,800
Musa, when we will see you again?

625
01:20:24,520 --> 01:20:25,760
Some day soon,

626
01:20:28,720 --> 01:20:29,960
when I find your father.

627
01:21:04,080 --> 01:21:05,160
Stefan...

628
01:21:10,320 --> 01:21:15,800
hey man, help me!
Stefan, Stefan?

629
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:17,640
Doctor, doctor!

630
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:09,880
Just for tonight Okay. Let' go.

631
01:22:18,960 --> 01:22:19,720
What's wrong?

632
01:22:20,760 --> 01:22:21,840
I'm sorry, baby,

633
01:22:22,840 --> 01:22:24,280
your sister died in Sebokeng,

634
01:22:24,480 --> 01:22:27,000
and her two little ones showed up here
early this morning.

635
01:22:28,240 --> 01:22:31,800
What? What are you going to do?

636
01:22:34,080 --> 01:22:40,520
Is this the boy?
Why did you bring him?

637
01:22:44,400 --> 01:22:48,240
Look, I didn't ask
for those children to be brought here,

638
01:22:48,720 --> 01:22:50,760
I didn't ask for any of this!

639
01:22:51,480 --> 01:22:52,880
Just do as you please.

640
01:23:42,360 --> 01:23:43,560
Get out of my way!

641
01:23:45,840 --> 01:23:50,400
Nobe? Nobe Lebese? Is that you?

642
01:23:51,320 --> 01:23:54,200
Pastor Gophe! I'm sorry sir,

643
01:23:54,800 --> 01:23:56,840
I didn't see you, very sorry.

644
01:24:01,560 --> 01:24:03,560
Come, come, help me to church.

645
01:24:04,240 --> 01:24:05,640
Sure pastor, sure.

646
01:24:22,480 --> 01:24:26,280
Nobe? Why were you in such a panic?

647
01:24:28,040 --> 01:24:29,640
It's nothing pastor.

648
01:24:33,440 --> 01:24:37,800
No Nobe, it's not nothing, I know you.

649
01:24:39,600 --> 01:24:44,040
It's this disease, there is no escape.

650
01:24:46,640 --> 01:24:48,720
I'd just heard that
my sister has died from it.

651
01:24:49,880 --> 01:24:52,840
I see. I'm sorry.

652
01:24:55,920 --> 01:24:59,240
What can we do? We must stop this.

653
01:25:00,240 --> 01:25:02,360
The People don't want to talk about it.

654
01:25:03,400 --> 01:25:06,760
If they admit they have it they're shunned.

655
01:25:08,120 --> 01:25:09,480
They feel shame.

656
01:25:11,280 --> 01:25:14,000
I haven't even preached
an AIDS funeral yet.

657
01:25:15,480 --> 01:25:16,800
How could that be?

658
01:25:18,160 --> 01:25:22,680
The death certificate lists
only the disease that killed them,

659
01:25:23,920 --> 01:25:26,720
it never tells if AIDS was involved.

660
01:25:28,560 --> 01:25:30,600
Maybe it's easier
for the families that way.

661
01:25:31,920 --> 01:25:36,040
We've spent too long fooling ourselves

662
01:25:36,720 --> 01:25:39,080
because it's easier that way.

663
01:25:40,640 --> 01:25:43,960
People must face this killer

664
01:25:44,880 --> 01:25:46,400
and you've got to tell them.

665
01:25:48,480 --> 01:25:50,400
The people don't want to hear it.

666
01:25:52,520 --> 01:25:54,320
Only God knows what to do.

667
01:26:12,680 --> 01:26:13,800
There is a meeting,

668
01:26:19,640 --> 01:26:21,320
there is a killer in the township.

669
01:26:25,760 --> 01:26:30,560
Hey, come to church,
hurry to church, there is a meeting.

670
01:26:33,080 --> 01:26:34,920
There is a killer in the township

671
01:26:46,720 --> 01:26:47,680
Can I come in?

672
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:50,240
Of course.
All are welcome into this house.

673
01:26:56,240 --> 01:26:59,120
What's this about a killer?
What's going on?

674
01:27:08,040 --> 01:27:10,880
Please, please settle down.

675
01:27:14,320 --> 01:27:15,200
Nobe!

676
01:27:24,560 --> 01:27:26,120
There is a killer among us.

677
01:27:28,400 --> 01:27:37,000
It is killing our wives,
our neighbors and our children.

678
01:27:39,320 --> 01:27:42,480
It is HIV/AIDS.

679
01:27:44,080 --> 01:27:45,160
Not this again,

680
01:27:46,480 --> 01:27:48,520
we are sick of hearing about this.

681
01:27:49,760 --> 01:27:52,280
What can we do about it? It's hopeless.

682
01:27:55,560 --> 01:27:56,400
You're killing yourselves

683
01:27:56,600 --> 01:27:59,840
and your loved ones out of fear and shame.

684
01:28:01,360 --> 01:28:03,440
I did not see it for what it was.

685
01:28:04,320 --> 01:28:06,080
Now, I do.

686
01:28:06,960 --> 01:28:09,240
Ignoring this disease is a sin.

687
01:28:11,720 --> 01:28:13,600
We are the children of light,

688
01:28:14,120 --> 01:28:17,160
and only the light of truth can save us.

689
01:28:19,240 --> 01:28:22,960
It must starts here and now.

690
01:28:28,160 --> 01:28:31,160
Yes there is wisdom in what he says.

691
01:28:32,240 --> 01:28:33,960
God grant us that wisdom.

692
01:28:35,320 --> 01:28:36,440
They say my daughter has it,

693
01:28:36,640 --> 01:28:38,040
but she looks very healthy.

694
01:28:38,480 --> 01:28:39,520
How could it be?

695
01:28:39,920 --> 01:28:41,480
My sister and her husband have it,

696
01:28:41,880 --> 01:28:43,280
they don't want to talk about it,

697
01:28:43,480 --> 01:28:44,720
we're all scared.

698
01:28:45,000 --> 01:28:46,680
Show them compassion.

699
01:28:47,520 --> 01:28:48,880
Do not shun them.

700
01:28:49,280 --> 01:28:51,080
Help them in any way you can.

701
01:28:52,240 --> 01:28:53,440
Do not judged.

702
01:28:53,640 --> 01:28:56,360
How can we fight it? We have no medicine.

703
01:28:56,720 --> 01:28:58,920
We will fight it with the truth.

704
01:28:59,720 --> 01:29:04,200
Truth? What's my daughter
suppose to do with truth?

705
01:29:04,400 --> 01:29:06,240
The truth can unite us,

706
01:29:06,520 --> 01:29:08,520
and let us draw courage from each other.

707
01:29:09,960 --> 01:29:13,840
Together we can
have the strength to go on.

708
01:30:33,840 --> 01:30:35,760
It was a good thing you did last night.

709
01:30:37,240 --> 01:30:38,800
It was good to speak the truth.

710
01:30:41,760 --> 01:30:45,480
Musa, there are shelters,
places for street kids.

711
01:30:45,960 --> 01:30:46,760
It's not much,

712
01:30:46,960 --> 01:30:49,120
but it's better than the streets.

713
01:30:51,840 --> 01:30:55,480
No, I haven't found uncle Majola.

714
01:30:56,720 --> 01:30:58,760
Musa, you have to get off the streets.

715
01:30:59,280 --> 01:31:01,160
I'm going to take you to the shelter.

716
01:31:06,480 --> 01:31:08,200
Musa! Musa! Musa!

717
01:31:11,920 --> 01:31:14,880
Hey! Hey Musa

718
01:31:24,640 --> 01:31:27,520
Nobe, you're in very early.

719
01:31:28,080 --> 01:31:29,120
Yebo, Laurain.

720
01:31:29,400 --> 01:31:30,400
Did you hear?

721
01:31:31,760 --> 01:31:33,320
Majola Mkhize died.

722
01:31:34,200 --> 01:31:34,920
Who?

723
01:31:35,320 --> 01:31:40,840
The Major, Majola Mkhinze, the guard
that was shot when Sue was hijacked.

724
01:31:41,600 --> 01:31:42,520
Remember?

725
01:31:44,080 --> 01:31:45,000
Good guy.

726
01:33:13,560 --> 01:33:17,120
Hey have you seen Musa
the boy who caries a drum.

727
01:33:44,720 --> 01:33:47,800
Is there anything I can do for you?

728
01:33:51,920 --> 01:33:53,040
No, thanks.

729
01:34:07,440 --> 01:34:10,160
I'm sorry if I'm disturbing you.

730
01:34:12,440 --> 01:34:14,720
No, please come in.

731
01:34:15,760 --> 01:34:18,280
I brought some of Stefan's things
from the house.

732
01:34:19,080 --> 01:34:20,880
Personal items, I thought you'd want.

733
01:34:24,240 --> 01:34:25,320
Thanks

734
01:34:25,520 --> 01:34:28,640
It's not much, some old pictures,
his diploma.

735
01:34:31,160 --> 01:34:33,040
It's very kind of you.

736
01:34:37,240 --> 01:34:38,280
Mr. Botha,

737
01:34:47,400 --> 01:34:49,560
even though
Stefan knew he was dying,

738
01:34:50,520 --> 01:34:53,760
he fought to make something of his life.

739
01:34:56,120 --> 01:34:57,240
I know.

740
01:35:08,760 --> 01:35:11,840
Actually Tumisho, I do need your help.

741
01:35:12,240 --> 01:35:14,120
Of course, what is it?

742
01:35:17,840 --> 01:35:19,160
Thanks you everybody.

743
01:35:20,320 --> 01:35:25,000
I'm very happy that you manage
to get here so quickly. Thank you.

744
01:35:25,960 --> 01:35:31,120
Some of you just heard that
my son Stefan

745
01:35:33,200 --> 01:35:34,920
died unexpectedly.

746
01:35:37,720 --> 01:35:42,160
What you don't know
is that he had AIDS.

747
01:35:45,120 --> 01:35:46,760
That is why, from today,

748
01:35:47,120 --> 01:35:49,920
we are offering free
testing and counseling

749
01:35:51,080 --> 01:35:52,680
for all of you and your families.

750
01:35:54,640 --> 01:35:56,800
We have a nurse here
to take blood samples,

751
01:35:57,000 --> 01:35:58,600
but I want to stress,

752
01:35:59,720 --> 01:36:03,240
it's all voluntary. It's up to you!

753
01:36:04,560 --> 01:36:06,920
And if any of you do tests positive,

754
01:36:09,560 --> 01:36:11,320
you're not going to loose yourjobs,

755
01:36:12,440 --> 01:36:14,320
and will do our very best to help you.

756
01:36:18,960 --> 01:36:20,040
Thank you.

757
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:31,880
I'll be the first one to be tested.

758
01:36:33,600 --> 01:36:35,040
Anyone will join me?

759
01:37:42,240 --> 01:37:43,880
- Nobe!
- Sir,

760
01:37:45,160 --> 01:37:46,080
Yes sir?

761
01:37:46,760 --> 01:37:48,280
Thanks for what you did there.

762
01:37:49,200 --> 01:37:50,440
No problem sir...

763
01:37:55,080 --> 01:37:55,920
Sir...

764
01:37:56,400 --> 01:37:57,280
Yeah?

765
01:37:59,120 --> 01:38:02,360
It's about the Major, and a little boy.

766
01:38:04,120 --> 01:38:05,240
Check over there man.

767
01:38:12,720 --> 01:38:13,680
Thank you sir.

768
01:38:14,800 --> 01:38:15,800
Hey Musa,

769
01:38:21,680 --> 01:38:22,440
Musa,

770
01:38:23,960 --> 01:38:25,160
we want to talk to you.

771
01:38:29,480 --> 01:38:31,040
This is Mr. Botha.

772
01:38:32,280 --> 01:38:33,320
Hello Musa.

773
01:38:35,160 --> 01:38:38,920
Sorry son, we have news about your uncle.

774
01:38:39,760 --> 01:38:40,640
You found him?

775
01:38:42,160 --> 01:38:45,840
Musa it's bad news.

776
01:38:46,920 --> 01:38:52,360
Your uncle Majola has been shot and killed.

777
01:38:55,440 --> 01:38:57,280
He was a guard at the depot.

778
01:38:58,800 --> 01:39:01,320
He was a brave man Musa, like you.

779
01:39:06,800 --> 01:39:08,400
What am I going to do?

780
01:39:13,880 --> 01:39:15,240
That's why we here.

781
01:39:21,000 --> 01:39:22,880
My uncle did what need to be done.

782
01:39:25,320 --> 01:39:26,680
I will do so too.

783
01:39:27,760 --> 01:39:29,120
You have Musa.

784
01:39:31,520 --> 01:39:32,680
What do you mean?

785
01:39:33,080 --> 01:39:37,960
You've worked hard.
You've worked honestly like a man should.

786
01:39:39,880 --> 01:39:46,080
Yeah I did. I earned money
so grandmother could replace Khalazome.

787
01:39:48,160 --> 01:39:49,400
What does that mean?

788
01:39:49,680 --> 01:39:51,040
She was my old cow.

789
01:39:52,240 --> 01:39:55,520
Her name means
"cry, then her tears will dry up",

790
01:39:56,720 --> 01:39:59,440
like mine, tears are over.

791
01:40:04,440 --> 01:40:06,640
Musa how would you like
to go to a new home?

792
01:40:08,200 --> 01:40:11,400
Safe place to sleep nice place to play.

793
01:40:13,120 --> 01:40:15,120
Go to school? A good school.

794
01:40:16,240 --> 01:40:17,600
Can Thandi come too?

795
01:40:18,320 --> 01:40:19,960
We'll ask grandmother.

796
01:40:24,200 --> 01:40:25,800
The God sent you mister.

797
01:40:26,960 --> 01:40:28,000
No,

798
01:40:30,840 --> 01:40:32,760
I think it's the other way around.

799
01:40:47,760 --> 01:40:49,160
Good afternoon!

800
01:40:49,360 --> 01:40:50,360
Good afternoon.

801
01:40:52,280 --> 01:40:53,400
I remember you.

802
01:40:54,560 --> 01:40:56,040
You the one who brought us bread.

803
01:41:06,960 --> 01:41:08,680
Welcome to our home, Musa.

804
01:41:21,080 --> 01:41:22,280
If I had a son,

805
01:41:23,200 --> 01:41:25,120
I'd want him to be just like you.

806
01:41:29,520 --> 01:41:30,640
Thanks Nobe,

807
01:41:33,680 --> 01:41:35,160
thanks for everything.

808
01:41:58,200 --> 01:41:59,920
T. It's you.

809
01:42:03,520 --> 01:42:04,840
I knew you would find me.

810
01:42:10,560 --> 01:42:14,400
Poor little thing.
She was beaten, left for dead.

811
01:42:17,520 --> 01:42:18,680
She's safe now.

812
01:42:53,520 --> 01:42:54,600
I saved it for you.

813
01:42:55,080 --> 01:42:56,800
Musa, you found my bracelet.

814
01:42:57,960 --> 01:43:01,160
I, I really missed you Musa.

815
01:43:02,600 --> 01:43:03,800
I missed you too.

816
01:43:08,640 --> 01:43:10,920
T. Iook, there is even a swing

817
01:43:11,400 --> 01:43:12,680
just like I prayed.

818
01:43:16,000 --> 01:43:18,440
Yes, Musa, even a swing,
just like you prayed.

819
01:43:24,120 --> 01:43:25,360
Don't cry T.

820
01:43:34,960 --> 01:43:36,240
It's a brand new day...

821
01:43:38,320 --> 01:43:39,080
Come...

822
01:44:07,280 --> 01:44:09,320
AIDS has already orphaned more than

823
01:44:09,600 --> 01:44:12,120
12 million African children.

824
01:44:12,440 --> 01:44:15,600
30 million people

825
01:44:15,920 --> 01:44:17,840
in sub-Saharan Africa

826
01:44:18,160 --> 01:44:21,400
carry the HIV/AIDS virus.
