00:00:15,503 --> 00:00:18,202
<i>What can you tell me about
this supposed haunted house?</i>

3
00:00:18,204 --> 00:00:19,237
<i>The one on Cedar Road.</i>

4
00:00:20,407 --> 00:00:22,106
To stay away from it.

5
00:00:22,108 --> 00:00:23,408
Why?

6
00:00:23,410 --> 00:00:25,777
Because it's haunted.

7
00:00:25,779 --> 00:00:28,514
It's a stupid old urban
legend made up by kids.

8
00:00:28,516 --> 00:00:29,347
So it's not real?

9
00:00:29,349 --> 00:00:30,314
No.

10
00:00:30,316 --> 00:00:31,517
If you live there...

11
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:33,352
...the other ghost or demon...

12
00:00:33,354 --> 00:00:36,121
...starts to slowly start
to get inside your head.

13
00:00:36,123 --> 00:00:38,057
I guess the paranormal
activity in the house

14
00:00:38,059 --> 00:00:39,691
is so terrifying that...

15
00:00:39,693 --> 00:00:42,227
...every family that's
tried to live there...

16
00:00:42,229 --> 00:00:44,829
...has left less than, what,
21 days after moving in.

17
00:00:44,831 --> 00:00:46,631
And... when they leave,

18
00:00:46,633 --> 00:00:48,834
which is usually in
the middle of the night,

19
00:00:48,836 --> 00:00:52,170
they leave all their belongings, but...

20
00:00:52,172 --> 00:00:54,539
...take the time to...

21
00:00:54,541 --> 00:00:57,578
Take the time to cover up all the mirrors.

22
00:00:58,611 --> 00:01:00,612
It owns you. It's...

23
00:01:00,614 --> 00:01:02,848
It's claimed your soul.

24
00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:07,386
Well they say that the ghost or demon

25
00:01:07,388 --> 00:01:10,455
follows them to the next
place where they live,

26
00:01:10,457 --> 00:01:13,694
threatening to kill them
if they talk about it.

27
00:01:15,028 --> 00:01:17,863
<i>The house was built in 1890.</i>

28
00:01:17,865 --> 00:01:19,832
It was the site of a
major, major land dispute

29
00:01:19,834 --> 00:01:22,000
between the local Indians and the family

30
00:01:22,002 --> 00:01:24,470
who had moved there after buying
the land from the government.

31
00:01:24,472 --> 00:01:25,273
The Samuels.

32
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:27,940
<i>The Indians had
claimed for a long time</i>

33
00:01:27,942 --> 00:01:29,307
<i>that the land was rightfully theirs.</i>

34
00:01:29,309 --> 00:01:32,443
<i>That it was the site of
this ancient burial ground.</i>

35
00:01:32,445 --> 00:01:33,711
<i>And legend has it</i>

36
00:01:33,713 --> 00:01:37,181
<i>that the family only lived
in that house for 21 days...</i>

37
00:01:37,183 --> 00:01:38,951
<i>...and then they were gone.</i>

38
00:01:38,953 --> 00:01:40,184
Everything was there.

39
00:01:40,186 --> 00:01:42,220
Their possessions,
their horses. Everything.

40
00:01:42,222 --> 00:01:43,955
Like, they had planned to come back

41
00:01:43,957 --> 00:01:45,457
and just stepped away for a little bit.

42
00:01:45,459 --> 00:01:46,824
But they never did.

43
00:01:46,826 --> 00:01:48,827
No, I don't think the house is haunted...

44
00:01:48,829 --> 00:01:49,631
...or cursed.

45
00:01:50,998 --> 00:01:54,032
Most likely, I think the Indians
probably massacred the family

46
00:01:54,034 --> 00:01:56,568
and buried their bodies
there on the property.

47
00:01:56,570 --> 00:01:57,970
Or maybe up in the local mountains

48
00:01:57,972 --> 00:01:59,338
so they'd never be found.

49
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:01,940
Well that really doesn't explain

50
00:02:01,942 --> 00:02:03,708
all of the strange circumstances

51
00:02:03,710 --> 00:02:06,244
for any of the families
that have lived there since.

52
00:02:06,246 --> 00:02:08,046
Oh, you mean the-the Warner family.

53
00:02:08,048 --> 00:02:10,949
Yes. They moved in there in 1977.

54
00:02:10,951 --> 00:02:15,187
<i>The Warners. They were
such a nice family.</i>

55
00:02:15,189 --> 00:02:17,922
<i>The little girl, Tricia,
I went to school with her.</i>

56
00:02:17,924 --> 00:02:21,593
<i>She was just the
happiest kid, but then...</i>

57
00:02:21,595 --> 00:02:23,395
<i>...her personality
started to change.</i>

58
00:02:23,397 --> 00:02:27,231
She became more remote.
She didn't talk much.

59
00:02:27,233 --> 00:02:30,502
And then, on what would have been their...

60
00:02:30,504 --> 00:02:32,538
...19th day living in the house,

61
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:34,873
the family left abruptly
in the middle of the night,

62
00:02:34,875 --> 00:02:37,342
<i>and they didn't take
anything with them.</i>

63
00:02:37,344 --> 00:02:38,576
<i>They never went back.</i>

64
00:02:38,578 --> 00:02:41,379
<i>They let the house be foreclosed on.</i>

65
00:02:41,381 --> 00:02:44,482
They would never talk to
anybody about what happened.

66
00:02:44,484 --> 00:02:46,552
The little girl went mute.

67
00:02:46,554 --> 00:02:48,253
People say she was institutionalized.

68
00:02:48,255 --> 00:02:50,488
I guess she still is and...

69
00:02:50,490 --> 00:02:51,890
...the boy, Cory Warner,

70
00:02:51,892 --> 00:02:55,059
was tragically killed in a car accident.

71
00:02:55,061 --> 00:02:57,796
<i>I'm told on his way
to talk to a reporter</i>

72
00:02:57,798 --> 00:02:59,598
<i>about the house.</i>

73
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:02,968
And what about the tenants
who lived there most recently?

74
00:03:02,970 --> 00:03:05,003
Within the last two months
they moved out, I think?

75
00:03:05,005 --> 00:03:06,538
Right, right. Lisa Thompson...

76
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:09,408
...and her nine-year-old
son, Jonathan.

77
00:03:09,410 --> 00:03:11,343
<i>Just shortly after they moved in,</i>

78
00:03:11,345 --> 00:03:13,344
<i>her little boy went mute.</i>

79
00:03:13,346 --> 00:03:14,913
<i>This little boy went mute...</i>

80
00:03:14,915 --> 00:03:16,380
<i>...just like the family
that was living there</i>

81
00:03:16,382 --> 00:03:18,183
<i>back in 1977?</i>

82
00:03:18,185 --> 00:03:19,154
Yes.

83
00:03:20,254 --> 00:03:23,956
<i>Uh, they moved in, uh,
but only stayed for...</i>

84
00:03:23,958 --> 00:03:26,658
<i>...20 days before...</i>

85
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:28,593
<i>...they moved out.</i>

86
00:03:28,595 --> 00:03:31,063
Is she still in town?

87
00:03:31,065 --> 00:03:32,964
Oh, yes, she is. But she won't talk to you.

88
00:03:32,966 --> 00:03:35,335
She won't talk to anybody about the house.

89
00:03:39,806 --> 00:03:40,905
There she is.

90
00:03:40,907 --> 00:03:42,876
There she is, there she is, there she is.

91
00:03:43,977 --> 00:03:44,811
Come on.

92
00:03:47,748 --> 00:03:48,946
Lisa?

93
00:03:54,255 --> 00:03:55,954
Lisa Thompson?

94
00:03:57,191 --> 00:03:58,626
Lisa Thompson?

95
00:03:59,292 --> 00:04:00,558
Who are you?

96
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:02,893
My name's Jacob Anderson. We're filmmakers.

97
00:04:02,895 --> 00:04:05,796
Get the fuck out of my property!

98
00:04:05,798 --> 00:04:07,933
Why did you leave the house
so soon after moving in?

99
00:04:07,935 --> 00:04:09,468
Only 20 days.

100
00:04:09,470 --> 00:04:11,335
Why was that? You left abruptly.

101
00:04:11,337 --> 00:04:12,671
What happened to you and your son

102
00:04:12,673 --> 00:04:14,209
while living there?

103
00:04:14,774 --> 00:04:15,974
Lisa?

104
00:04:15,976 --> 00:04:20,279
Lisa, why did you leave all
of your belongings behind?

105
00:04:20,281 --> 00:04:24,349
Get the fuck out of my property now!

106
00:04:24,351 --> 00:04:25,887
Lisa, please!

107
00:04:29,223 --> 00:04:30,658
Let's go back to the car.

108
00:04:31,959 --> 00:04:33,627
What the hell was that?

109
00:04:41,168 --> 00:04:43,435
Hey. You see that?

110
00:04:43,437 --> 00:04:45,137
Isn't that that mother's kid...

111
00:04:45,139 --> 00:04:46,270
...in the window?

112
00:04:46,272 --> 00:04:49,010
Oh, yeah. What's he doing?

113
00:04:50,476 --> 00:04:54,246
Guys, I don't have a
good feeling about this.

114
00:04:54,248 --> 00:04:55,447
We should leave.

115
00:04:55,449 --> 00:04:57,114
She's obviously not gonna talk to us.

116
00:04:57,116 --> 00:04:58,349
But why not?

117
00:04:58,351 --> 00:05:01,152
Why won't she talk about the house?

118
00:05:01,154 --> 00:05:04,522
I don't know, man. Dude,
she-she seemed scared.

119
00:05:04,524 --> 00:05:05,724
No shit.

120
00:05:05,726 --> 00:05:07,125
Scared by what?

121
00:05:07,127 --> 00:05:08,029
Who?

122
00:05:08,796 --> 00:05:10,094
Wait, didn't that last woman

123
00:05:10,096 --> 00:05:12,197
say that the demons or ghosts follow them?

124
00:05:12,199 --> 00:05:13,597
Shit!

125
00:05:13,599 --> 00:05:14,733
Turn off that camera!

126
00:05:14,735 --> 00:05:16,301
What the hell?

127
00:05:18,705 --> 00:05:19,971
Oh, my God!

128
00:05:19,973 --> 00:05:20,906
Crazy!

129
00:05:20,908 --> 00:05:22,173
Crazy bitch!

130
00:05:22,175 --> 00:05:24,476
- The fuck?!
- What the fuck was that?

131
00:05:24,478 --> 00:05:26,111
That was insane!

132
00:05:26,113 --> 00:05:27,512
What if she hit on of us?!

133
00:05:27,514 --> 00:05:29,584
We're not going back there again.

134
00:05:32,118 --> 00:05:34,251
Who we gonna go interview next?

135
00:05:34,253 --> 00:05:35,152
Shit.

136
00:05:35,154 --> 00:05:36,654
Next time you do the interview, Kurt.

137
00:05:36,656 --> 00:05:37,623
All right man.

138
00:05:37,625 --> 00:05:39,224
Well, dude the rock was right by my head!

139
00:05:39,226 --> 00:05:40,592
You saw that.

140
00:05:40,594 --> 00:05:41,960
Probably aiming for your head.

141
00:05:41,962 --> 00:05:43,695
- Shit.
- Big ol' head.

142
00:05:43,697 --> 00:05:44,632
I had the window open.

143
00:05:46,332 --> 00:05:50,801
If she would've hit you... Oh, my
God, I don't know what I would've done.

144
00:05:50,803 --> 00:05:52,039
Dude, that was terrifying.

145
00:05:58,010 --> 00:05:59,144
You got this, Shauna.

146
00:05:59,146 --> 00:06:00,245
<i>Hello?</i>

147
00:06:00,247 --> 00:06:03,515
Hello. Mrs. Warner? Mrs. Carolyn Warner?

148
00:06:03,517 --> 00:06:05,250
<i>Who is this?</i>

149
00:06:05,252 --> 00:06:07,051
Um, my name's Shauna Roberts.

150
00:06:07,053 --> 00:06:09,087
I'm a filmmaker working on a documentary.

151
00:06:09,089 --> 00:06:10,789
Mrs. Warner, what exactly happened

152
00:06:10,791 --> 00:06:12,457
to your family when you were living there?

153
00:06:12,459 --> 00:06:15,426
You left after living
there for only 19 days.

154
00:06:15,428 --> 00:06:17,928
What happened to your daughter, Tricia?

155
00:06:17,930 --> 00:06:19,231
We understand she went mute

156
00:06:19,233 --> 00:06:20,965
just like the last little boy. The other...

157
00:06:20,967 --> 00:06:22,801
<i>Leave my daughter out of this!</i>

158
00:06:22,803 --> 00:06:25,337
Fuck!

159
00:06:25,339 --> 00:06:27,240
Great job, Shauna.

160
00:06:28,108 --> 00:06:29,407
Oh, shit.

161
00:06:29,409 --> 00:06:32,844
<i>So from 1977 'til now,
no one's lived there?</i>

162
00:06:32,846 --> 00:06:35,947
No, no. People were scared off.

163
00:06:35,949 --> 00:06:38,849
<i>You see, every time someone even
talked about buying the property,</i>

164
00:06:38,851 --> 00:06:41,685
<i>the local Indians
would pay them a visit.</i>

165
00:06:41,687 --> 00:06:42,721
<i>Tell them all kinds of stories</i>

166
00:06:42,723 --> 00:06:44,356
<i>about how the land was evil.</i>

167
00:06:44,358 --> 00:06:45,791
<i>That anybody who lived there</i>

168
00:06:45,793 --> 00:06:48,262
<i>would have some tragedy befall them.</i>

169
00:06:50,363 --> 00:06:52,200
What's with the 21 days?

170
00:07:01,207 --> 00:07:03,474
It takes 21 days for the demon

171
00:07:03,476 --> 00:07:05,544
to fully enter the soul of the human.

172
00:07:10,784 --> 00:07:12,616
The others left in time...

173
00:07:12,618 --> 00:07:14,621
...with their souls intact.

174
00:07:15,522 --> 00:07:17,722
But their lives were never the same.

175
00:07:18,625 --> 00:07:21,258
Before abandoning the house...

176
00:07:21,260 --> 00:07:23,727
...the two previous homeowners...

177
00:07:23,729 --> 00:07:25,697
...covered all the mirrors.

178
00:07:25,699 --> 00:07:26,968
Why was that?

179
00:07:27,935 --> 00:07:30,234
To keep the demon from entering the soul.

180
00:07:30,236 --> 00:07:31,602
See, when the mirrors are covered,

181
00:07:31,604 --> 00:07:32,904
the demon sleeps.

182
00:07:32,906 --> 00:07:36,373
He cannot capture your soul.

183
00:07:36,375 --> 00:07:38,510
The belief by many in town...

184
00:07:38,512 --> 00:07:42,914
...is that your people scared
off the previous homeowners

185
00:07:42,916 --> 00:07:45,317
because you believe the
land is rightfully yours.

186
00:07:45,319 --> 00:07:46,551
And...

187
00:07:46,553 --> 00:07:50,055
...because you believe it sits
on an ancient burial ground.

188
00:07:57,897 --> 00:08:01,366
We do believe the land is ours.

189
00:08:01,368 --> 00:08:03,635
It sits upon a vortex.

190
00:08:03,637 --> 00:08:06,805
A portal to the underworld:
the Devil's playground.

191
00:08:08,408 --> 00:08:11,075
There are some places so dark, so evil,

192
00:08:11,077 --> 00:08:14,414
...no human, no living being,
should ever dwell there.

193
00:08:18,317 --> 00:08:19,620
Good to know.

194
00:08:21,822 --> 00:08:23,854
It's not the dead in
this town that's scary...

195
00:08:23,856 --> 00:08:24,856
It's the living.

196
00:08:24,858 --> 00:08:27,491
Yeah, no shit.

197
00:08:27,493 --> 00:08:29,961
Why I am glad that I brought this.

198
00:08:29,963 --> 00:08:31,295
- Dude, what the fuck?
- A little protection.

199
00:08:31,297 --> 00:08:33,265
Jacob! I can't believe you brought a gun!

200
00:08:33,267 --> 00:08:34,466
Yeah, are you that kind of jerk

201
00:08:34,468 --> 00:08:36,034
that just brings a gun around everywhere?

202
00:08:36,036 --> 00:08:38,002
Jesus Christ, are you kidding me?

203
00:08:38,004 --> 00:08:39,337
After some of the people we've met?

204
00:08:39,339 --> 00:08:41,142
It's like fucking <i>Deliverance.</i>

205
00:08:42,175 --> 00:08:44,245
You'll be glad I brought it. Trust me.

206
00:08:51,884 --> 00:08:53,086
This is it.

207
00:08:59,593 --> 00:09:04,496
It's in through on of these trees.

208
00:09:04,498 --> 00:09:05,900
Yeah, here we go.

209
00:09:08,234 --> 00:09:09,369
Yeah.

210
00:09:15,408 --> 00:09:17,741
This doesn't scare you Jacob?

211
00:09:17,743 --> 00:09:19,376
- What? Trees?
- Yeah.

212
00:09:19,378 --> 00:09:22,347
No. No, it doesn't. Nothin' scares me.

213
00:09:22,349 --> 00:09:23,448
Yeah.

214
00:09:23,450 --> 00:09:26,150
Gotta let your imagination run wild, man.

215
00:09:26,152 --> 00:09:28,886
You know, you always are
filled with the craziest ideas.

216
00:09:28,888 --> 00:09:31,423
You're not gonna film me
putting cinnamon in my mouth.

217
00:09:31,425 --> 00:09:33,294
Come on, man, have a little fun.

218
00:09:39,065 --> 00:09:40,731
That's pretty nice, actually.

219
00:09:40,733 --> 00:09:42,467
This must be the, uh, guy from the bank.

220
00:09:42,469 --> 00:09:43,938
He's gonna let us in.

221
00:09:45,705 --> 00:09:47,204
Look how proper he looks.

222
00:09:47,206 --> 00:09:48,505
Hey, there.

223
00:09:48,507 --> 00:09:49,707
Is that thing on?

224
00:09:49,709 --> 00:09:52,544
That thing is on. He's our main cameraman.

225
00:09:52,546 --> 00:09:53,477
Wow, wow.

226
00:09:53,479 --> 00:09:54,312
He's gonna make you look good, though.

227
00:09:54,314 --> 00:09:55,480
You gonna get us in there?

228
00:09:55,482 --> 00:09:57,048
Uh, let's get you in there right now.

229
00:09:57,050 --> 00:09:59,016
Okay, show us the way.

230
00:09:59,018 --> 00:10:00,986
Follow me this way.

231
00:10:00,988 --> 00:10:02,623
Duck your heads, everyone.

232
00:10:05,892 --> 00:10:06,924
Well, I gotta say

233
00:10:06,926 --> 00:10:08,326
it doesn't seem too creepy from here

234
00:10:08,328 --> 00:10:09,760
except for spider webs.

235
00:10:09,762 --> 00:10:14,031
- Creepy?
- It seems really beautiful, actually.

236
00:10:14,033 --> 00:10:15,232
Thank you so much.

237
00:10:15,234 --> 00:10:16,934
After you, sir.

238
00:10:16,936 --> 00:10:18,068
Everything's pretty much

239
00:10:18,070 --> 00:10:20,270
the way the last owner left it.

240
00:10:20,272 --> 00:10:22,406
Oh, my gosh.

241
00:10:24,978 --> 00:10:26,211
Guess the, uh, banks

242
00:10:26,213 --> 00:10:27,946
aren't really responsible
for cleaning the place up.

243
00:10:27,948 --> 00:10:29,680
No.

244
00:10:29,682 --> 00:10:32,384
It's gonna be on you Shauna.

245
00:10:32,386 --> 00:10:34,318
- Dining room.
- Are these their packing boxes?

246
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,553
They didn't even finish
unpacking before they left?

247
00:10:36,555 --> 00:10:38,155
I guess so.

248
00:10:38,157 --> 00:10:39,659
- Hm.
- Huh.

249
00:10:44,631 --> 00:10:46,731
Hey! Who knows? Maybe...

250
00:10:46,733 --> 00:10:48,098
...we'll end up taking this place.

251
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:49,266
It could be our dream house.

252
00:10:49,268 --> 00:10:50,836
- This is a good house.
- Shut up.

253
00:10:53,906 --> 00:10:56,741
And so, who technically owns...

254
00:10:56,743 --> 00:10:59,276
...all the belongings in here? The bank?

255
00:10:59,278 --> 00:11:00,614
Right now, the bank.

256
00:11:01,547 --> 00:11:05,283
Wow. There's some pretty nice things.

257
00:11:05,285 --> 00:11:06,717
- Wanna check the bedrooms?
- Yeah.

258
00:11:06,719 --> 00:11:07,754
I'd love to.

259
00:11:09,321 --> 00:11:11,291
One of the smaller rooms right there.

260
00:11:15,328 --> 00:11:16,394
Wow.

261
00:11:16,396 --> 00:11:17,795
Whoa.

262
00:11:17,797 --> 00:11:19,630
It looks like somebody was just in here.

263
00:11:19,632 --> 00:11:20,901
- Goodness.
- I know.

264
00:11:22,636 --> 00:11:24,169
This was his room.

265
00:11:24,171 --> 00:11:25,772
Oh, my God.

266
00:11:26,672 --> 00:11:29,376
Oh. This picture.

267
00:11:58,371 --> 00:12:00,675
He's not gonna let us get one
night's sleep. It's gonna be...

268
00:12:04,344 --> 00:12:05,943
Done checkin' out the bathroom?

269
00:12:05,945 --> 00:12:07,281
Really.

270
00:12:09,950 --> 00:12:11,318
This thing's huge.

271
00:12:17,224 --> 00:12:19,926
- Huh.
- I really like this fireplace.

272
00:12:30,336 --> 00:12:32,370
This is the master bedroom.

273
00:12:32,372 --> 00:12:33,907
Oh! I want this room.

274
00:12:35,142 --> 00:12:36,540
- It's so pretty.
- The kid's room, and that room

275
00:12:36,542 --> 00:12:38,275
and then this room.

276
00:12:38,277 --> 00:12:39,778
It's... one too many.

277
00:12:39,780 --> 00:12:40,944
Hey guys. Did you notice

278
00:12:40,946 --> 00:12:43,180
that all the mirrors are covered

279
00:12:43,182 --> 00:12:45,884
exactly like they told us they would be?

280
00:12:45,886 --> 00:12:47,188
That's what they said. Yeah.

281
00:12:48,688 --> 00:12:51,789
Lisa Thompson, she really
just... Her and her son...

282
00:12:51,791 --> 00:12:53,091
...left all of her stuff behind

283
00:12:53,093 --> 00:12:54,759
and didn't come back for anything?

284
00:12:54,761 --> 00:12:56,130
Um, nope.

285
00:13:02,401 --> 00:13:04,635
That mirror's covered, too.

286
00:13:04,637 --> 00:13:05,839
Fuck.

287
00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:08,005
Holy shit.

288
00:13:08,007 --> 00:13:09,808
Hey, come here. Look at this.

289
00:13:09,810 --> 00:13:12,943
She even left most of
her and her son's clothes.

290
00:13:12,945 --> 00:13:14,379
- Whoa.
- Whoa.

291
00:13:14,381 --> 00:13:15,279
Weird, huh?

292
00:13:15,281 --> 00:13:16,680
Did she ever say...

293
00:13:16,682 --> 00:13:19,016
...what happened to her in this house?

294
00:13:19,018 --> 00:13:19,887
What scared her?

295
00:13:20,887 --> 00:13:23,855
Nothing specific. Only
that the place was...

296
00:13:23,857 --> 00:13:26,156
...haunted and that no
one should live here.

297
00:13:26,158 --> 00:13:28,259
She immediately forfeited
the rights to the place.

298
00:13:28,261 --> 00:13:29,660
Sending it into foreclosure.

299
00:13:29,662 --> 00:13:31,029
We're gonna find out, man.

300
00:13:31,031 --> 00:13:33,530
We're gonna find out what
happened in this house,

301
00:13:33,532 --> 00:13:35,335
and we're gonna get it all on camera.

302
00:13:37,103 --> 00:13:39,603
This basically just says
that if anything happens to us

303
00:13:39,605 --> 00:13:41,105
or we die in the house,

304
00:13:41,107 --> 00:13:46,077
the bank or town... won't
take any responsibility.

305
00:13:49,715 --> 00:13:51,850
I'm leaving a few windows open just an inch

306
00:13:51,852 --> 00:13:53,650
for fresh air to come in.

307
00:13:53,652 --> 00:13:56,520
This is the best way... um...

308
00:13:56,522 --> 00:13:59,524
In the event of an
emergency, like a fire...

309
00:13:59,526 --> 00:14:01,058
...you're gonna have to break
through the windows to get out

310
00:14:01,060 --> 00:14:04,361
because everything will
be completely barricaded.

311
00:14:04,363 --> 00:14:06,731
This us, uh... at your request.

312
00:14:06,733 --> 00:14:08,533
You know those reality shows?

313
00:14:08,535 --> 00:14:11,568
They stay in a haunted house for a night?

314
00:14:11,570 --> 00:14:14,905
We're gonna stay in this house for 21 days.

315
00:14:14,907 --> 00:14:16,307
And when we do that...

316
00:14:16,309 --> 00:14:18,208
...we're gonna be the
longest lasting residents

317
00:14:18,210 --> 00:14:20,044
to have stayed here more than 20 days.

318
00:14:20,046 --> 00:14:21,612
So, I mean, honestly...

319
00:14:21,614 --> 00:14:23,847
...we just want to disprove
or debunk, or whatever,

320
00:14:23,849 --> 00:14:27,150
the urban legend that surrounds this house.

321
00:14:27,152 --> 00:14:28,785
I know it's not haunted.

322
00:14:28,787 --> 00:14:30,087
Hey. That reminds me, actually.

323
00:14:30,089 --> 00:14:32,823
Before we get hermetically
sealed up in this place...

324
00:14:32,825 --> 00:14:34,726
..Kurt, why don't you take Shauna and, uh,

325
00:14:34,728 --> 00:14:36,193
go see if you can find that...

326
00:14:36,195 --> 00:14:37,361
...Indian burial ground?

327
00:14:37,363 --> 00:14:38,862
I'm gonna go check out the barn.

328
00:14:38,864 --> 00:14:40,164
- Sure thing, dude.
- Thanks.

329
00:14:40,166 --> 00:14:41,698
Thanks, man. Thanks a lot.

330
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:43,167
Thanks, guys.

331
00:14:43,169 --> 00:14:44,438
Looks good.

332
00:15:17,002 --> 00:15:18,605
Holy shit.

333
00:15:35,655 --> 00:15:37,091
Jesus.

334
00:15:42,094 --> 00:15:43,897
I don't see any headstones.

335
00:15:44,897 --> 00:15:47,231
Kurt, it's an ancient burial ground.

336
00:15:47,233 --> 00:15:49,733
Not gonna see any headstones.

337
00:15:49,735 --> 00:15:51,034
What's it gonna look like

338
00:15:51,036 --> 00:15:52,736
so we know what the hell to look for?

339
00:15:52,738 --> 00:15:56,009
I don't know. Mounds or rocks or something.

340
00:16:05,819 --> 00:16:07,721
What the fuck?

341
00:16:11,557 --> 00:16:13,293
They're everywhere.

342
00:16:14,493 --> 00:16:16,727
Hey, didn't that guy yesterday...

343
00:16:16,729 --> 00:16:18,196
Didn't he tell us the dream catchers

344
00:16:18,198 --> 00:16:20,063
are used for catching evil?

345
00:16:20,065 --> 00:16:22,733
Why are they placed in
the ground like that?

346
00:16:22,735 --> 00:16:24,871
Dream catchers are supposed to be hung.

347
00:16:34,714 --> 00:16:36,481
Not scared yet, are you?

348
00:16:36,483 --> 00:16:38,716
We-we really can't get out?

349
00:16:38,718 --> 00:16:39,887
Nope.

350
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:43,154
Hey, thanks guys!

351
00:16:43,156 --> 00:16:45,289
We're officially locked in this house.

352
00:16:45,291 --> 00:16:47,991
21 days and 21 nights.

353
00:16:50,629 --> 00:16:53,097
All right, so basically,
the whole house is covered.

354
00:16:53,099 --> 00:16:54,731
All of the cameras...

355
00:16:54,733 --> 00:16:57,000
All of the cameras...
with nighttime vision.

356
00:16:57,002 --> 00:16:58,602
Now this is going to allow us...

357
00:16:58,604 --> 00:16:59,836
...to see in low light

358
00:16:59,838 --> 00:17:01,639
or even no light environments.

359
00:17:01,641 --> 00:17:04,708
Now, I've also placed what
is called an EMF meter,

360
00:17:04,710 --> 00:17:06,576
better known as a ghost detector,

361
00:17:06,578 --> 00:17:07,911
in each room.

362
00:17:07,913 --> 00:17:09,246
Now this turns it on.

363
00:17:09,248 --> 00:17:11,282
And this will basically light up and beep

364
00:17:11,284 --> 00:17:14,217
if someone or something passes by

365
00:17:14,219 --> 00:17:16,387
disturbing that electromagnetic field.

366
00:17:16,389 --> 00:17:17,955
I also placed

367
00:17:17,957 --> 00:17:21,159
a digital still camera in the barn.

368
00:17:21,161 --> 00:17:22,895
You can see it right there.

369
00:17:23,962 --> 00:17:25,129
And what I'm gonna be doing

370
00:17:25,131 --> 00:17:27,732
is I'm gonna be taking a still digital shot

371
00:17:27,734 --> 00:17:29,300
about once every hour.

372
00:17:29,302 --> 00:17:30,901
It should be noted that...

373
00:17:30,903 --> 00:17:32,303
...the barn has also been barricaded

374
00:17:32,305 --> 00:17:34,971
to keep anybody from getting in.

375
00:17:34,973 --> 00:17:36,506
Now, this is going to allow us

376
00:17:36,508 --> 00:17:38,942
to see if anything moves or changes,

377
00:17:38,944 --> 00:17:41,481
or just if anything
peculiar happens at all.

378
00:17:44,116 --> 00:17:47,618
I found all these crazy
things... in the barn

379
00:17:47,620 --> 00:17:50,455
that belonged to the people
who used to live here.

380
00:17:50,457 --> 00:17:54,225
Paranormal researchers usually
call these trigger objects,

381
00:17:54,227 --> 00:17:56,627
meaning they might trigger something

382
00:17:56,629 --> 00:17:58,528
in the spirits of the
people who lived here.

383
00:17:58,530 --> 00:17:59,663
Awesome.

384
00:17:59,665 --> 00:18:01,364
Or... the objects themselves

385
00:18:01,366 --> 00:18:05,203
may have some kind of residual
memories of what happened

386
00:18:05,205 --> 00:18:06,736
and just being back in the house

387
00:18:06,738 --> 00:18:09,142
might trigger some sort of...

388
00:18:10,008 --> 00:18:11,942
...paranormal reaction.

389
00:18:11,944 --> 00:18:14,180
- Somebody's been doin' their research.
- Yeah.

390
00:18:16,082 --> 00:18:18,448
- You found all of these in there?
- Yeah.

391
00:18:18,450 --> 00:18:21,188
- Sweet.
- Like... full train set.

392
00:18:46,645 --> 00:18:48,114
Hey, guys.

393
00:18:49,149 --> 00:18:50,480
Guys?

394
00:18:50,482 --> 00:18:53,284
- Grr!
- Shit! The fuck, dude?

395
00:18:53,286 --> 00:18:55,055
Oh, my God.

396
00:18:55,654 --> 00:18:57,023
Don't do that, man!

397
00:18:58,525 --> 00:19:01,892
So remind me why you're
putting this in my room again.

398
00:19:01,894 --> 00:19:04,430
So the spirits will come
out and play with this.

399
00:19:06,833 --> 00:19:08,399
Okay, that was... that was pretty cool.

400
00:19:08,401 --> 00:19:09,937
I think he looks a lot like you.

401
00:19:12,838 --> 00:19:14,240
All right.

402
00:19:18,545 --> 00:19:20,578
Oh, gosh.

403
00:19:20,580 --> 00:19:22,213
You know, since none of the past owners

404
00:19:22,215 --> 00:19:24,348
will just tell us what happened here,

405
00:19:24,350 --> 00:19:26,650
maybe their belongings will.

406
00:19:26,652 --> 00:19:29,954
Right, Raggedy Ann?
What happened here, huh?

407
00:19:29,956 --> 00:19:31,688
Guys, this is creepy, though.

408
00:19:31,690 --> 00:19:32,957
What?

409
00:19:32,959 --> 00:19:35,092
They covered all the mirrors.

410
00:19:35,094 --> 00:19:37,361
Well, not for long.

411
00:19:37,363 --> 00:19:39,130
You ready?

412
00:19:39,132 --> 00:19:41,364
Didn't the Native Americans to us not to...

413
00:19:41,366 --> 00:19:43,467
...you know, uncover these mirrors?

414
00:19:43,469 --> 00:19:44,834
Dude, they warned us not to.

415
00:19:44,836 --> 00:19:46,070
Oh, you know what? You're right.

416
00:19:46,072 --> 00:19:48,438
Let's just scrap the whole thing.

417
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:51,007
Let's just call the bank
rep and have him let us out.

418
00:19:51,009 --> 00:19:52,877
Is that what you want? That what you want?

419
00:19:52,879 --> 00:19:54,178
No. All right, all right.

420
00:19:54,180 --> 00:19:55,780
Cry me a river.

421
00:19:55,782 --> 00:19:57,217
Seriously.

422
00:19:58,651 --> 00:20:00,951
- Oh, my God! My hand!
- Shit.

423
00:20:00,953 --> 00:20:01,851
Jacob!

424
00:20:01,853 --> 00:20:03,220
Those Native Americans...

425
00:20:03,222 --> 00:20:04,957
Wait, get Raggedy Ann.

426
00:20:07,227 --> 00:20:09,860
All right, Kurt. That
can be your room here.

427
00:20:09,862 --> 00:20:11,728
You know what my room reminds me of?

428
00:20:11,730 --> 00:20:14,165
My grandma's house.

429
00:20:14,167 --> 00:20:16,833
All right, well... if
this is Grandma's house

430
00:20:16,835 --> 00:20:19,903
you've got one demonic, demented grandma.

431
00:20:19,905 --> 00:20:21,205
My room, too?

432
00:20:21,207 --> 00:20:22,776
That's the deal.

433
00:20:26,379 --> 00:20:28,545
God, that's weird that they
just left all that stuff

434
00:20:28,547 --> 00:20:30,284
laying around like that.

435
00:20:44,264 --> 00:20:46,767
It's a lot of mirrors they covered.

436
00:20:54,106 --> 00:20:55,706
You don't scare anybody...

437
00:20:55,708 --> 00:20:57,307
...little bitch devil.

438
00:20:57,309 --> 00:20:59,276
I don't see any demon in here.

439
00:20:59,278 --> 00:21:00,710
Are you in here, demon?

440
00:21:00,712 --> 00:21:02,780
Do you wanna suck my soul?

441
00:21:02,782 --> 00:21:04,151
You can suck my soul.

442
00:21:06,018 --> 00:21:07,720
Guys, I took 'em all off.

443
00:21:10,456 --> 00:21:11,658
Hey, Shauna!

444
00:21:12,758 --> 00:21:14,859
Hey, they got a tub in here.

445
00:21:14,861 --> 00:21:16,496
You should totally use it.

446
00:21:27,739 --> 00:21:31,111
All this talk of demons has got me horny.

447
00:22:57,296 --> 00:23:00,230
So I created a timeline

448
00:23:00,232 --> 00:23:03,434
of the three families
who tried to live here.

449
00:23:03,436 --> 00:23:04,401
Um...

450
00:23:04,403 --> 00:23:06,903
Some of these are really creepy.

451
00:23:06,905 --> 00:23:08,805
Especially of the last two.

452
00:23:08,807 --> 00:23:11,141
- Built in 1890.
- Awesome.

453
00:23:11,143 --> 00:23:13,209
You get these pictures from the historian?

454
00:23:13,211 --> 00:23:15,111
Mm-hmm. Yeah.

455
00:23:15,113 --> 00:23:16,413
That's cool.

456
00:23:16,415 --> 00:23:18,417
They all covered the mirrors.

457
00:23:19,951 --> 00:23:22,122
I wish something would happen.

458
00:23:23,456 --> 00:23:24,755
Why are you whispering?

459
00:23:27,860 --> 00:23:31,695
I really wanna start
to see some, you know...

460
00:23:31,697 --> 00:23:32,699
...activity.

461
00:23:33,799 --> 00:23:35,401
You're crazy. Careful what you wish for.

462
00:25:58,544 --> 00:26:00,811
Come here, come here!
Check this out! Come on!

463
00:26:00,813 --> 00:26:01,946
Ooh.

464
00:26:01,948 --> 00:26:03,280
What's goin' on?

465
00:26:03,282 --> 00:26:04,715
I was-I was, uh...

466
00:26:04,717 --> 00:26:06,249
I was checking the still images

467
00:26:06,251 --> 00:26:08,351
from last night in the barn.

468
00:26:08,353 --> 00:26:09,586
Yeah?

469
00:26:09,588 --> 00:26:12,523
All right, so this is, like, 12 o'clock.

470
00:26:12,525 --> 00:26:13,959
One o'clock.

471
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:16,395
Two o'clock.

472
00:26:17,162 --> 00:26:18,795
Three o'clock.

473
00:26:18,797 --> 00:26:20,296
Oh, my God.

474
00:26:20,298 --> 00:26:21,564
That is pretty cool.

475
00:26:21,566 --> 00:26:23,367
And you're sure you checked
the surveillance camera

476
00:26:23,369 --> 00:26:25,569
and nobody got in there?

477
00:26:25,571 --> 00:26:26,540
No.

478
00:26:27,373 --> 00:26:29,073
The place is totally locked down.

479
00:26:29,075 --> 00:26:32,309
There's no windows, so there's no wind

480
00:26:32,311 --> 00:26:35,478
that could've came in or
blown it across or anything.

481
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:37,648
It just moves. It... Watch.

482
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:42,820
That's insane!

483
00:26:42,822 --> 00:26:44,621
You checked the EVP recorder, right?

484
00:26:44,623 --> 00:26:45,659
Yeah, yeah...

485
00:26:46,892 --> 00:26:50,159
Dude, if there's a sound,
man, the baseline will spike.

486
00:26:50,161 --> 00:26:52,065
It's-it's flatlined.

487
00:27:46,919 --> 00:27:48,188
Jacob?

488
00:27:49,188 --> 00:27:50,590
Jacob?

489
00:28:18,551 --> 00:28:19,816
Kurt?

490
00:28:27,159 --> 00:28:28,328
Hm.

491
00:29:15,507 --> 00:29:16,776
Wh...

492
00:29:27,987 --> 00:29:30,320
It's on the inside, dude.

493
00:29:30,322 --> 00:29:32,054
The hand print. Look.

494
00:29:32,056 --> 00:29:34,760
- Fuck.
- It came from inside the house.

495
00:29:43,067 --> 00:29:44,336
It's crazy.

496
00:29:46,471 --> 00:29:47,706
Dude, where's Shauna?

497
00:31:45,990 --> 00:31:48,327
What the fuck?

498
00:32:02,708 --> 00:32:05,342
Was this the only thing
that was in the box?

499
00:32:05,344 --> 00:32:06,877
Yeah.

500
00:32:06,879 --> 00:32:08,548
There's nothing else in there?

501
00:32:09,614 --> 00:32:11,250
I just saw the pictures.

502
00:32:12,951 --> 00:32:14,450
It looks like they did it in blood.

503
00:32:14,452 --> 00:32:17,321
Come on, it's not blood.

504
00:32:17,323 --> 00:32:19,689
It's probably, like, magic marker
or something. You're ridiculous.

505
00:32:19,691 --> 00:32:21,490
You fucking kidding me? That's blood.

506
00:32:21,492 --> 00:32:24,226
Zoom in on the photo.
It's blood. Look at it.

507
00:32:24,228 --> 00:32:26,466
Okay, okay, cameraman.

508
00:32:27,565 --> 00:32:30,434
Well... whatever it is,
who would even do this?

509
00:32:30,436 --> 00:32:31,905
Where did we find these?

510
00:32:33,138 --> 00:32:34,971
Kurt, doesn't it look
like the symbol we saw

511
00:32:34,973 --> 00:32:37,207
on the dream catchers we saw outside?

512
00:32:37,209 --> 00:32:39,775
Kinda looks like a... pentagram.

513
00:32:39,777 --> 00:32:41,413
But not quite.

514
00:32:42,081 --> 00:32:43,280
I dunno, man.

515
00:32:43,282 --> 00:32:45,181
There's a reasonable explanation for it.

516
00:32:45,183 --> 00:32:46,416
There always is.

517
00:32:46,418 --> 00:32:47,851
What's the explanation? Tell me.

518
00:32:47,853 --> 00:32:48,884
How am I supposed to know?

519
00:32:48,886 --> 00:32:50,120
Why don't we go look at the fact

520
00:32:50,122 --> 00:32:51,621
that we have the entire house recorded

521
00:32:51,623 --> 00:32:53,890
and see that there's nobody who did this,

522
00:32:53,892 --> 00:32:55,492
so they were probably
stashed there by somebody

523
00:32:55,494 --> 00:32:59,129
to scare off every other
person who's been in the house.

524
00:32:59,131 --> 00:33:00,730
Look.

525
00:33:00,732 --> 00:33:03,533
The symbol is almost exactly identical

526
00:33:03,535 --> 00:33:06,669
to the symbol we saw on
the... on the pictures here.

527
00:33:06,671 --> 00:33:08,304
Look.

528
00:33:08,306 --> 00:33:11,140
Those two Native American
dudes we met the other day,

529
00:33:11,142 --> 00:33:13,278
they probably marked up these pictures.

530
00:33:14,513 --> 00:33:15,946
No, Jacob.

531
00:33:15,948 --> 00:33:17,848
Sure they did. To scare us off.

532
00:33:17,850 --> 00:33:19,015
Well, why in the hell did they put them

533
00:33:19,017 --> 00:33:20,449
all the way in the back of the closet

534
00:33:20,451 --> 00:33:21,985
if they wanted us to see them?

535
00:33:21,987 --> 00:33:24,254
Yeah, and, I mean, how do
you explain the hand print?

536
00:33:24,256 --> 00:33:26,656
That came from inside the house.

537
00:33:26,658 --> 00:33:28,057
Who the hell turned on the water?

538
00:33:28,059 --> 00:33:30,326
It's an old house with faulty pipes, Kurt.

539
00:33:30,328 --> 00:33:32,963
But that doesn't explain the hand print.

540
00:33:32,965 --> 00:33:35,732
Look. I think all this
weird shit we're seeing,

541
00:33:35,734 --> 00:33:38,334
it's just a result of these
guys wanting to scare us off.

542
00:33:38,336 --> 00:33:40,303
Just like they did with the other families.

543
00:33:40,305 --> 00:33:42,139
I mean, if it was those guys doing this,

544
00:33:42,141 --> 00:33:44,373
we would see it. But we don't.

545
00:33:44,375 --> 00:33:46,309
The hand print, it-it just appears.

546
00:33:46,311 --> 00:33:48,945
Well, first of all...

547
00:33:48,947 --> 00:33:50,613
...we can't even see the handprint

548
00:33:50,615 --> 00:33:52,515
from the angle of the
surveillance camera, okay?

549
00:33:52,517 --> 00:33:54,517
It's Shauna's handheld where we pick it up.

550
00:33:54,519 --> 00:33:55,851
Come on, dude.

551
00:33:55,853 --> 00:33:58,088
Look. I don't know how they did it,

552
00:33:58,090 --> 00:34:00,756
but I'm convinced they did it.

553
00:34:00,758 --> 00:34:02,525
There's nothing evil here.

554
00:34:02,527 --> 00:34:04,263
There's no demon.

555
00:34:07,466 --> 00:34:10,766
I know. I just can't wait
to get out of this house.

556
00:34:10,768 --> 00:34:11,902
I know.

557
00:34:11,904 --> 00:34:14,172
Yeah, we can go get fro-yo, or something.

558
00:34:40,064 --> 00:34:42,699
Hey, Jacob, Shauna, come here!

559
00:34:42,701 --> 00:34:44,170
You gotta hear this!

560
00:34:50,209 --> 00:34:51,241
What's goin' on?

561
00:34:51,243 --> 00:34:54,310
So... I was looking at the EVPs last night.

562
00:34:54,312 --> 00:34:55,444
Well, you got to look at your other camera

563
00:34:55,446 --> 00:34:56,480
if you got something.

564
00:34:56,482 --> 00:34:57,917
Listen to what happens in the barn.

565
00:35:06,991 --> 00:35:08,991
Sounds like something, but...

566
00:35:08,993 --> 00:35:11,094
...I can't-I can't
hear what. What is that?

567
00:35:11,096 --> 00:35:12,962
Exactly. All right. Now, check it out.

568
00:35:12,964 --> 00:35:14,698
This happened last night

569
00:35:14,700 --> 00:35:17,400
right before Shauna
discovered the hand print.

570
00:35:17,402 --> 00:35:22,906
Shauna!
- Come play with us.

571
00:35:22,908 --> 00:35:24,241
Oh, my God.

572
00:35:24,243 --> 00:35:27,544
Shauna? Come play with us?!

573
00:35:27,546 --> 00:35:28,781
Holy shit.

574
00:35:29,714 --> 00:35:31,114
Kurt...

575
00:35:31,116 --> 00:35:34,817
...bring up the, uh,
still image from the barn.

576
00:35:34,819 --> 00:35:35,752
Get that?

577
00:35:35,754 --> 00:35:37,754
Yeah. It's right here.

578
00:35:37,756 --> 00:35:39,156
What's with all those orbs?

579
00:35:39,158 --> 00:35:40,924
Okay. Now, uh...

580
00:35:40,926 --> 00:35:42,391
...compare it to the one from last night.

581
00:35:42,393 --> 00:35:44,096
I just wanna see something.

582
00:35:45,864 --> 00:35:47,763
Holy shit, the scythe in
the corner of the barn.

583
00:35:47,765 --> 00:35:49,031
It's gone.

584
00:35:49,033 --> 00:35:50,100
What happened to it?

585
00:35:50,102 --> 00:35:51,268
I don't know, man.

586
00:35:51,270 --> 00:35:54,004
It probably just fell out
of camera range, you know?

587
00:35:54,006 --> 00:35:56,373
Check-check the outside camera.

588
00:35:56,375 --> 00:35:57,774
Kurt, make sure nobody broke in,

589
00:35:57,776 --> 00:35:59,241
took it or... You know?

590
00:35:59,243 --> 00:36:01,413
Something reasonable. See what happened.

591
00:36:02,781 --> 00:36:05,181
Dude, it's... it's totally locked down.

592
00:36:05,183 --> 00:36:06,016
I don't know.

593
00:36:06,018 --> 00:36:07,616
No one got in.

594
00:36:07,618 --> 00:36:09,387
It's-it's fucking gone, dude.

595
00:36:12,957 --> 00:36:14,359
Holy shit.

596
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:17,194
Let me take the camera.

597
00:36:17,196 --> 00:36:19,161
Where are you goin'?

598
00:36:19,163 --> 00:36:20,864
I wanna go check out the window

599
00:36:20,866 --> 00:36:22,634
where we saw the hand print.

600
00:36:45,089 --> 00:36:46,358
Hm.

601
00:37:17,723 --> 00:37:19,725
- What is it?
- What's going on?

602
00:37:21,727 --> 00:37:22,627
Did you...

603
00:37:23,495 --> 00:37:24,960
- What the fuck?
- Holy shit.

604
00:37:24,962 --> 00:37:28,498
Did you... Did you guys do that?

605
00:37:28,500 --> 00:37:29,632
What?

606
00:37:29,634 --> 00:37:31,000
What are you talkin' about?

607
00:37:31,002 --> 00:37:33,136
Did you guys put that there?

608
00:37:33,138 --> 00:37:35,138
Shauna, what the fuck?

609
00:37:35,140 --> 00:37:37,040
Get a grip. We're locked in here.

610
00:37:37,042 --> 00:37:39,074
This is from the barn.

611
00:37:39,076 --> 00:37:40,377
Oh, my God.

612
00:37:40,379 --> 00:37:42,712
Then how the hell did it get in here?

613
00:37:42,714 --> 00:37:44,681
I don't know.

614
00:37:44,683 --> 00:37:48,083
Baby. Baby, here, look. Hand me the camera.

615
00:37:48,085 --> 00:37:50,353
OH, my God. You're shaking.

616
00:37:50,355 --> 00:37:52,522
Relax. Get some rest, okay?

617
00:37:52,524 --> 00:37:53,993
We'll check this out.

618
00:37:55,227 --> 00:37:56,362
It's okay.

619
00:37:56,928 --> 00:37:58,397
I'll be right here.

620
00:38:05,370 --> 00:38:07,607
How the fuck did this get in here, dude?

621
00:38:12,777 --> 00:38:15,145
Shauna must've been so terrified, man.

622
00:38:15,147 --> 00:38:17,212
Hm. She's a big girl.

623
00:38:17,214 --> 00:38:18,651
Did you just see that open?

624
00:38:19,685 --> 00:38:21,353
No.

625
00:38:29,393 --> 00:38:32,261
Did you see that? Did you see it open?

626
00:38:32,263 --> 00:38:34,633
Hm, I dunno. Kind of.

627
00:38:37,002 --> 00:38:38,734
Oh, man. Dude, you got to admit

628
00:38:38,736 --> 00:38:42,237
this makes for some pretty
fuckin' good footage, though.

629
00:38:42,239 --> 00:38:44,440
And I can smell the money now.

630
00:38:44,442 --> 00:38:46,676
This is exactly what we needed, dude.

631
00:38:46,678 --> 00:38:49,045
This is exactly what we wanted.

632
00:38:49,047 --> 00:38:51,480
That is going to have
the network pick it up.

633
00:38:51,482 --> 00:38:53,251
That alone.

634
00:38:54,685 --> 00:38:55,919
I mean, if they even believe

635
00:38:55,921 --> 00:38:58,455
that we didn't fake it ourselves.

636
00:38:58,457 --> 00:38:59,922
It's not what I wanted, man.

637
00:38:59,924 --> 00:39:02,359
Well, what is it exactly that you do want?

638
00:39:02,361 --> 00:39:03,659
Nothing? Nothing to happen?

639
00:39:03,661 --> 00:39:05,127
We just stay in a house for 21 days

640
00:39:05,129 --> 00:39:06,730
for no fucking reason

641
00:39:06,732 --> 00:39:08,565
and just come out of
here broke with nothing?

642
00:39:08,567 --> 00:39:10,500
You say some stupid ass shit sometimes.

643
00:39:10,502 --> 00:39:11,868
It's nothing to be worried about.

644
00:39:11,870 --> 00:39:13,370
Look at your face. Pussy face.

645
00:39:13,372 --> 00:39:15,638
Look at your face. Look how stupid that is.

646
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:16,505
It's a man's face.

647
00:39:16,507 --> 00:39:18,040
That is not a man's face.

648
00:39:18,042 --> 00:39:20,275
- Look at that face.
- That's a shit face. That's a face...

649
00:39:20,277 --> 00:39:22,379
Look at the money in my mouth.

650
00:39:22,381 --> 00:39:24,279
Laughing all the way to the bank.

651
00:39:24,281 --> 00:39:26,583
Look at you... meditating.

652
00:39:26,585 --> 00:39:29,486
Look at me. Let me look in your eyes.

653
00:39:29,488 --> 00:39:31,154
Are you the devil?

654
00:39:31,156 --> 00:39:33,355
You know, I'm tired of
fuckin' hearing you talk.

655
00:39:33,357 --> 00:39:34,491
Seriously.

656
00:39:34,493 --> 00:39:36,027
Damn it. Chill out.

657
00:39:50,308 --> 00:39:51,344
Hey, babe.

658
00:39:53,377 --> 00:39:54,446
How ya feelin'?

659
00:39:57,281 --> 00:39:58,484
Sweetie.

660
00:39:59,718 --> 00:40:00,886
It's gonna be fine.

661
00:40:01,919 --> 00:40:04,353
Everything's gonna be fine. I promise you.

662
00:40:04,355 --> 00:40:06,054
I'm gonna figure out
what the hell is going on.

663
00:40:06,056 --> 00:40:08,824
No. Just leave it alone, Jacob.

664
00:40:08,826 --> 00:40:10,592
Leave what alone? I
just wanna figure out...

665
00:40:10,594 --> 00:40:12,263
Seriously, like...

666
00:40:13,732 --> 00:40:15,397
That symbol...

667
00:40:15,399 --> 00:40:17,400
That circular symbol.

668
00:40:17,402 --> 00:40:19,736
I looked it up on the internet.

669
00:40:19,738 --> 00:40:22,538
And it was fucking appearing on rocks,

670
00:40:22,540 --> 00:40:25,375
drawings on rocks thousands of years ago.

671
00:40:25,377 --> 00:40:27,409
And depicting some...

672
00:40:27,411 --> 00:40:28,678
...like, the underworld.

673
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:30,413
Some demonic place.

674
00:40:30,415 --> 00:40:32,582
Baby, okay. Okay.

675
00:40:32,584 --> 00:40:33,919
Just...

676
00:40:36,254 --> 00:40:38,190
Whatever is in this house...

677
00:40:39,089 --> 00:40:41,727
...just fucking... just leave it alone.

678
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:45,797
Okay, baby. We'll leave it alone.

679
00:40:47,799 --> 00:40:49,132
I promise.

680
00:40:49,134 --> 00:40:50,536
I'll leave it alone.

681
00:42:40,511 --> 00:42:41,946
So, um...

682
00:42:42,814 --> 00:42:44,346
See anything last night?

683
00:42:44,348 --> 00:42:45,415
Hear anything?

684
00:42:45,417 --> 00:42:46,619
No.

685
00:42:47,152 --> 00:42:48,717
I don't know, man.

686
00:42:48,719 --> 00:42:50,189
Everything's pretty quiet.

687
00:42:52,424 --> 00:42:53,957
You know what I mean?
Last-last night I was, like,

688
00:42:53,959 --> 00:42:55,357
laying in bed, you know...

689
00:42:55,359 --> 00:42:56,491
...and then, you know,
when you, like, lay in bed

690
00:42:56,493 --> 00:42:58,761
and you kind of get
that feeling that like...

691
00:42:58,763 --> 00:43:00,996
...something weird going on. So you get up.

692
00:43:00,998 --> 00:43:02,332
I checked it and there was nothing.

693
00:43:02,334 --> 00:43:03,632
All right. So you didn't hear anything.

694
00:43:03,634 --> 00:43:05,301
That's good. I'm just...

695
00:43:05,303 --> 00:43:06,805
...worried about her.

696
00:43:08,138 --> 00:43:09,407
How she doin'?

697
00:43:10,007 --> 00:43:11,406
She's all right.

698
00:43:11,408 --> 00:43:12,574
Wants to leave.

699
00:43:12,576 --> 00:43:14,877
- Yeah.
- But... not an option.

700
00:43:14,879 --> 00:43:16,245
I mean, I can't blame her.

701
00:43:16,247 --> 00:43:17,245
Yeah.

702
00:43:17,247 --> 00:43:18,450
What? Do you wanna go too?

703
00:43:21,185 --> 00:43:23,319
You know, I'll... I'll stick it out.

704
00:43:23,321 --> 00:43:24,523
Gotta stick it out, man.

705
00:43:36,533 --> 00:43:38,067
Hear that up there?

706
00:43:38,069 --> 00:43:39,435
Hey.

707
00:43:39,437 --> 00:43:41,571
Why-why are you stompin' around out there?

708
00:43:41,573 --> 00:43:42,473
It's not me.

709
00:43:43,507 --> 00:43:46,375
- Do you hear that?
- Yeah, yeah, I do hear it.

710
00:43:47,478 --> 00:43:49,047
- What the fuck is that?
- Shh.

711
00:43:50,448 --> 00:43:51,817
Sounds like it's comin' from...

712
00:43:52,951 --> 00:43:54,484
It's coming from one of the bedrooms.

713
00:43:55,786 --> 00:43:56,821
Holy shit.

714
00:44:00,759 --> 00:44:02,525
Guys, I don't know where
that was coming from.

715
00:44:02,527 --> 00:44:04,027
Whose room.

716
00:44:04,029 --> 00:44:05,828
It's upstairs somewhere,
I know that for sure.

717
00:44:05,830 --> 00:44:07,663
Kurt, bring it up on the
surveillance cameras quick.

718
00:44:07,665 --> 00:44:09,598
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'll check it out.

719
00:44:09,600 --> 00:44:11,533
- They up?
- Dude...

720
00:44:11,535 --> 00:44:13,636
The EMF meter, look, it's going off.

721
00:44:13,638 --> 00:44:15,270
Oh!

722
00:44:15,272 --> 00:44:16,341
Holy shit.

723
00:44:19,511 --> 00:44:20,976
Everything's fine there.

724
00:44:22,346 --> 00:44:24,147
- That one?
- It's goin' off in your bedroom.

725
00:44:24,149 --> 00:44:25,948
All right. All right. You guys stay here.

726
00:44:25,950 --> 00:44:27,216
I'm gonna go check what's going on.

727
00:44:27,218 --> 00:44:28,583
Careful.

728
00:44:50,107 --> 00:44:51,542
He's goin' in.

729
00:45:01,719 --> 00:45:02,654
Shit.

730
00:45:21,506 --> 00:45:22,473
What the fuck?

731
00:45:23,274 --> 00:45:24,942
What the fuck was that?

732
00:45:27,111 --> 00:45:29,881
I swear to God I just
heard something in here.

733
00:45:48,466 --> 00:45:51,333
Holy shit.

734
00:46:22,399 --> 00:46:24,602
Hey Jacob! What's going on?!

735
00:46:37,881 --> 00:46:40,750
What the frack?

736
00:46:40,752 --> 00:46:43,252
Jesus.

737
00:46:43,254 --> 00:46:44,886
Hey, guys, it's nothing.

738
00:46:44,888 --> 00:46:46,688
The breeze must've blown
open the medicine cabinet

739
00:46:46,690 --> 00:46:48,259
or something.

740
00:46:59,536 --> 00:47:00,839
What's going on?

741
00:47:01,739 --> 00:47:03,175
Holy shit.

742
00:47:04,676 --> 00:47:05,844
What?

743
00:47:07,212 --> 00:47:09,578
Is this some kind of
sick fucking joke, Kurt?

744
00:47:09,580 --> 00:47:11,379
Dude, what are you fucking talking about?

745
00:47:11,381 --> 00:47:13,683
What the fuck is the matter with you?

746
00:47:13,685 --> 00:47:15,851
Don't you see he's fucking
freaking out right now?

747
00:47:15,853 --> 00:47:17,453
Why the fuck would you do this shit?

748
00:47:17,455 --> 00:47:19,688
I'm totally not prepared
to create that, dude!

749
00:47:19,690 --> 00:47:21,056
At all!

750
00:47:21,058 --> 00:47:23,960
These pictures weren't here
five fucking minutes ago.

751
00:47:23,962 --> 00:47:25,697
So tell me what happened.

752
00:47:26,663 --> 00:47:27,899
I don't know, man.

753
00:47:32,136 --> 00:47:33,605
Oh, my...

754
00:47:34,538 --> 00:47:35,873
The picture...

755
00:47:36,540 --> 00:47:38,341
They took it off my phone.

756
00:47:39,810 --> 00:47:42,545
Shauna. Shauna, stop it.

757
00:47:42,547 --> 00:47:44,980
Calm down, okay? Kurt did this.

758
00:47:46,584 --> 00:47:47,583
He's fucking around.

759
00:47:47,585 --> 00:47:48,817
You brought some kind
of fucked up printer...

760
00:47:48,819 --> 00:47:50,419
- Dude!
- ...that allows you to do this shit!

761
00:47:50,421 --> 00:47:52,321
What the fuck are you
talking about, asshole?!

762
00:47:52,323 --> 00:47:55,290
I told you! I did not do this, okay?

763
00:47:55,292 --> 00:47:56,525
It's just like the others.

764
00:47:56,527 --> 00:47:57,726
We're gonna die here.

765
00:47:57,728 --> 00:48:00,096
Shauna, we're not gonna die here.

766
00:48:00,098 --> 00:48:02,598
- We only have five days left.
- God damn it!

767
00:48:02,600 --> 00:48:06,067
What happened to those other
people is happening to us!

768
00:48:06,069 --> 00:48:08,004
We gotta get the fuck out of here!

769
00:48:08,006 --> 00:48:10,138
Now! We have to go!

770
00:48:10,140 --> 00:48:12,007
- What are you doing?
- Where the fuck is she going?!

771
00:48:12,009 --> 00:48:13,875
Jesus Christ!

772
00:48:13,877 --> 00:48:15,546
Calm down!

773
00:48:16,314 --> 00:48:18,246
Calm the fuck down!

774
00:48:18,248 --> 00:48:20,051
You're hurting me!

775
00:48:21,118 --> 00:48:22,652
Shauna!

776
00:48:22,654 --> 00:48:24,523
What am I supposed to do?

777
00:48:26,424 --> 00:48:29,725
Let her just smash the fucking window open?

778
00:48:29,727 --> 00:48:31,594
Destroy everything we're here to create?

779
00:48:31,596 --> 00:48:33,995
If they see that we maybe got out of here,

780
00:48:33,997 --> 00:48:35,766
no deal!

781
00:48:36,935 --> 00:48:38,266
We get nothing!

782
00:48:38,268 --> 00:48:39,601
Is that what you want?

783
00:48:39,603 --> 00:48:40,803
It's this house, dude.

784
00:48:40,805 --> 00:48:42,571
It-it-it's fucking
making me go insane...

785
00:48:42,573 --> 00:48:45,107
It's not the house. It's fucking you.

786
00:48:45,109 --> 00:48:46,509
I cannot deal with this shit.

787
00:48:46,511 --> 00:48:48,710
I need to fucking check on my girlfriend

788
00:48:48,712 --> 00:48:50,078
who hates me now

789
00:48:50,080 --> 00:48:51,980
'cause I'm trying to
keep this shit together.

790
00:48:51,982 --> 00:48:54,917
Because you guys cannot fucking
figure out what you're doing.

791
00:48:54,919 --> 00:48:58,054
What the fuck is wrong with you?!

792
00:48:58,056 --> 00:48:59,754
The fuck is wrong with me?!

793
00:48:59,756 --> 00:49:02,357
Fuck you! Son of a bitch!

794
00:49:02,359 --> 00:49:03,895
Get the fuck off of me!

795
00:49:04,562 --> 00:49:05,730
Ow!

796
00:49:06,730 --> 00:49:07,929
Son of a bitch!

797
00:49:07,931 --> 00:49:09,864
Get your fucking hands off of me!

798
00:49:09,866 --> 00:49:12,201
Fucking get the fuck off of me!

799
00:49:12,203 --> 00:49:14,870
Don't you fucking start
that shit with me, man.

800
00:49:14,872 --> 00:49:17,505
- Fucking...
- Don't you fucking do that.

801
00:49:17,507 --> 00:49:18,676
Don't.

802
00:49:21,111 --> 00:49:22,513
Leave me alone.

803
00:50:35,919 --> 00:50:37,021
Come on, guys.

804
00:50:38,022 --> 00:50:41,524
You have said... anything
to me in two days.

805
00:50:41,526 --> 00:50:43,625
You gotta admit, things
have been pretty calm.

806
00:50:43,627 --> 00:50:44,926
Nothing's happened.

807
00:50:44,928 --> 00:50:47,431
Last few days, it's been all good.

808
00:50:48,899 --> 00:50:51,168
You know, we only have three days left.

809
00:50:59,310 --> 00:51:01,480
- You know?
- I know your sorry but...

810
00:51:02,712 --> 00:51:05,283
I just can't, like, pick up and...

811
00:51:06,384 --> 00:51:10,419
Just have everything be
like it never happened.

812
00:51:10,421 --> 00:51:11,723
I know I fucked up.

813
00:51:17,661 --> 00:51:19,464
Once we finish this...

814
00:51:20,698 --> 00:51:23,399
...it's gonna be huge for us, Shauna.

815
00:51:23,401 --> 00:51:25,634
It'll be a new start.

816
00:51:25,636 --> 00:51:27,038
I promise.

817
00:51:27,672 --> 00:51:28,974
I know.

818
00:51:32,343 --> 00:51:34,143
Sleepin' in Kurt's room?

819
00:51:34,145 --> 00:51:35,611
Yeah.

820
00:51:35,613 --> 00:51:38,517
I swore to never mind that I noticed that.

821
00:52:56,993 --> 00:52:58,194
- Fuck.
- Fuck.

822
00:52:58,196 --> 00:52:59,127
Shit's happening in there, dude.

823
00:52:59,129 --> 00:53:01,465
Yeah, I know. I know. Don't wake her.

824
00:53:04,234 --> 00:53:07,101
Fuck. It's fucking dark as shit out.

825
00:53:16,346 --> 00:53:17,415
All right.

826
00:53:26,556 --> 00:53:28,325
Something's not right.

827
00:53:40,605 --> 00:53:42,904
What the fuck was that, dude?! Fuck!

828
00:53:42,906 --> 00:53:44,339
Jesus Christ!

829
00:53:59,656 --> 00:54:01,859
- Jesus...
- Are you all right?

830
00:54:04,227 --> 00:54:05,829
What the fuck.

831
00:54:07,497 --> 00:54:09,233
What the fuck?!

832
00:54:12,270 --> 00:54:14,069
Shauna ripped these fucking pictures up!

833
00:54:14,071 --> 00:54:15,103
No, dude!

834
00:54:15,105 --> 00:54:17,573
These photos were fucking
taken over a year ago!

835
00:54:21,444 --> 00:54:22,944
Dude, don't touch it.

836
00:54:22,946 --> 00:54:24,746
Dude, fuck! It's blood, dude!

837
00:54:24,748 --> 00:54:27,882
It's fucking... It's fucking blood, dude!

838
00:54:30,687 --> 00:54:31,689
Fuck!

839
00:54:34,424 --> 00:54:35,960
What the hell?

840
00:54:37,127 --> 00:54:39,194
- Oh, my God.
- What the hell is that, man?

841
00:54:39,196 --> 00:54:40,728
Holy crap.

842
00:54:43,834 --> 00:54:45,634
Dude, Kurt, what is that?

843
00:54:45,636 --> 00:54:47,572
I don't know, I don't know.

844
00:54:49,674 --> 00:54:50,675
Shit!

845
00:54:53,710 --> 00:54:54,913
Oh, God.

846
00:54:55,312 --> 00:54:56,513
The hell?

847
00:54:59,482 --> 00:55:00,882
What the fuck is going on?

848
00:55:00,884 --> 00:55:02,286
I don't know.

849
00:55:03,187 --> 00:55:06,054
Put it down. Put it down, put it down.

850
00:55:06,056 --> 00:55:07,656
We gotta get the fuck
outta this house, man.

851
00:55:07,658 --> 00:55:08,790
We need to get the fuck out!

852
00:55:08,792 --> 00:55:10,561
No, no.

853
00:55:13,897 --> 00:55:15,399
What are you doing?

854
00:55:18,402 --> 00:55:20,868
Shauna can't know about these.

855
00:55:20,870 --> 00:55:23,004
She'd freak out. It would kill her.

856
00:55:23,006 --> 00:55:24,406
Are you-are you fucking kidding me, dude?

857
00:55:24,408 --> 00:55:25,808
We have to tell her!

858
00:55:25,810 --> 00:55:27,076
No.

859
00:55:27,078 --> 00:55:28,676
It will be too much for her.

860
00:55:28,678 --> 00:55:29,812
She wouldn't be able to handle it.

861
00:55:29,814 --> 00:55:31,683
We only have two days left.

862
00:55:36,020 --> 00:55:38,219
It's the best thing?

863
00:55:38,221 --> 00:55:39,554
Fine.

864
00:55:51,301 --> 00:55:52,770
Is everything cool?

865
00:55:53,671 --> 00:55:55,040
Fuck!

866
00:55:55,872 --> 00:55:59,476
Yeah... yeah. Everything's fine.

867
00:56:03,681 --> 00:56:05,350
I'm gonna head to bed.

868
00:56:06,484 --> 00:56:07,716
Okay.

869
00:56:07,718 --> 00:56:09,817
I'm just gonna stay up
for a little while longer.

870
00:56:09,819 --> 00:56:11,286
See...

871
00:56:11,288 --> 00:56:13,058
...if anything's going on.

872
00:56:14,325 --> 00:56:16,190
Anything happens...

873
00:56:16,192 --> 00:56:17,692
...come get me.

874
00:56:17,694 --> 00:56:19,263
You got it.

875
00:58:26,223 --> 00:58:27,723
Jacob, Shauna! Get in here now!

876
00:58:27,725 --> 00:58:29,294
You have to see this!

877
00:58:30,426 --> 00:58:31,796
What's goin' on?

878
00:58:35,064 --> 00:58:36,765
Shauna, you... you don't need to see this.

879
00:58:36,767 --> 00:58:38,833
No, no, no. She has to see this.

880
00:58:38,835 --> 00:58:40,138
You have to.

881
00:58:44,542 --> 00:58:45,973
What the hell is that?

882
00:58:48,846 --> 00:58:51,049
Dude, what happened?
Where the hell did he go?

883
00:58:52,482 --> 00:58:53,882
The EMF meter, I mean...

884
00:58:53,884 --> 00:58:56,484
...it's right at this point
where the kid crosses frame.

885
00:58:56,486 --> 00:58:57,719
What?

886
00:58:57,721 --> 00:59:01,723
I-I still don't understand,
dude. What happened to him?

887
00:59:01,725 --> 00:59:03,862
He went inside of the house.

888
00:59:04,562 --> 00:59:05,594
What?

889
00:59:05,596 --> 00:59:06,962
What do you mean he
went inside of the house?

890
00:59:06,964 --> 00:59:10,232
It's still barricaded
shut. That's impossible.

891
00:59:10,234 --> 00:59:11,569
I know it is.

892
00:59:12,569 --> 00:59:14,736
But I mean, the-the
door, you know, it's...

893
00:59:14,738 --> 00:59:17,105
it's right beyond the
frame. So, you know...

894
00:59:17,107 --> 00:59:20,007
...he-he basically just goes in
as if it were fucking open, dude.

895
00:59:20,009 --> 00:59:22,743
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Let's roll back the footage.

896
00:59:22,745 --> 00:59:24,648
I wanna see the kid's face.

897
00:59:26,683 --> 00:59:28,151
Wait. Freeze the frame.

898
00:59:29,453 --> 00:59:30,953
Oh, my God.

899
00:59:30,955 --> 00:59:32,321
You know who that is?

900
00:59:32,323 --> 00:59:33,357
No. Who?

901
00:59:34,158 --> 00:59:36,024
That's Lisa Thompson's son.

902
00:59:36,026 --> 00:59:38,659
Her nine-year-old
mute son.

903
00:59:38,661 --> 00:59:40,862
Dude, there is no fucking
way that is the same kid.

904
00:59:40,864 --> 00:59:42,230
What the fuck is she talking about?

905
00:59:42,232 --> 00:59:43,334
Why are you having...

906
00:59:46,703 --> 00:59:47,872
Look.

907
00:59:50,975 --> 00:59:52,343
Holy shit.

908
00:59:54,344 --> 00:59:55,576
What the fuck is this kid

909
00:59:55,578 --> 00:59:57,649
coming here in the middle of the night for?

910
00:59:59,183 --> 01:00:00,515
Who're you calling?

911
01:00:01,417 --> 01:00:03,687
That lady that... The historian.

912
01:00:08,225 --> 01:00:10,891
- <i>Hello?</i>
- Hello? Clarice?

913
01:00:10,893 --> 01:00:12,527
Clarice Johnson?

914
01:00:12,529 --> 01:00:13,795
<i>Yes?</i>

915
01:00:13,797 --> 01:00:15,897
Hi, um. This is Shauna Roberts.

916
01:00:15,899 --> 01:00:17,299
I'm one of the filmmakers.

917
01:00:17,301 --> 01:00:20,835
We interviewed you a few weeks
ago about the house on Cedar Road.

918
01:00:20,837 --> 01:00:22,536
<i>Yes, it's Clarice</i>

919
01:00:22,538 --> 01:00:24,373
Great, uh, you...

920
01:00:24,375 --> 01:00:26,475
...don't by any chance
have Lisa Thompson's number,

921
01:00:26,477 --> 01:00:27,743
do you?

922
01:00:27,745 --> 01:00:29,243
Something really weird happened.

923
01:00:29,245 --> 01:00:31,580
Her son... it looked
like he was on our porch

924
01:00:31,582 --> 01:00:33,882
at, like, 2:30 in the morning last night.

925
01:00:33,884 --> 01:00:36,551
<i>That... that can't be.</i>

926
01:00:36,553 --> 01:00:37,955
What do you-what do you mean?

927
01:00:38,922 --> 01:00:40,621
<i>Lisa and her son were
killed last night</i>

928
01:00:40,623 --> 01:00:41,790
<i>in a car accident.</i>

929
01:00:41,792 --> 01:00:44,426
<i>It happened on the 99
Freeway outside of Fresno,</i>

930
01:00:44,428 --> 01:00:47,596
<i>about three hours away from here.</i>

931
01:00:47,598 --> 01:00:50,000
<i>Story's in the local paper today.</i>

932
01:00:54,103 --> 01:00:55,473
Oh, my God.

933
01:00:58,642 --> 01:00:59,674
<i>Uh, hello?</i>

934
01:00:59,676 --> 01:01:01,475
Hi, hi. Th-thank you.

935
01:01:01,477 --> 01:01:02,710
Thank you.

936
01:01:02,712 --> 01:01:04,545
Okay, bye.

937
01:01:04,547 --> 01:01:05,681
What the fuck?

938
01:01:05,683 --> 01:01:07,982
That cannot be possible.

939
01:01:07,984 --> 01:01:09,583
- They died?
- I need to see the article.

940
01:01:09,585 --> 01:01:11,719
No. Bullshit. I...

941
01:01:11,721 --> 01:01:12,955
Pull it up online.

942
01:01:12,957 --> 01:01:14,922
It would-it would be online if
something like that happened.

943
01:01:14,924 --> 01:01:16,123
We should look it up.

944
01:01:16,125 --> 01:01:17,394
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

945
01:01:20,797 --> 01:01:23,364
Here it is. Here it is. Okay.

946
01:01:23,366 --> 01:01:26,134
"Lisa Thompson, 35, of
Fillmore, California,

947

son, Jonathan,

948
01:01:27,937 --> 01:01:29,670

951
01:01:33,143 --> 01:01:34,442

01:01:38,881 --> 01:01:41,415
Authorities claim neither
weather nor alcohol

were factors in the accident.

Mother and son were pronounced

Jesus Christ.

963
01:02:08,344 --> 01:02:09,881
Do you guys remember...

964
01:02:10,980 --> 01:02:13,781
...the teenager who lived
in the house in the '70s?

965
01:02:13,783 --> 01:02:16,384

Francisco, California,

967
01:02:19,056 --> 01:02:20,755

plunging over a cliff.

970

Witnesses and police said weather
was not a factor in the accident

and that it appeared Warner intentionally

of unexplained paranormal phenomena."

977
01:02:43,513 --> 01:02:44,679
No one can convince me

978
01:02:44,681 --> 01:02:46,982
that those two accidents are coincidence.

979
01:02:46,984 --> 01:02:49,984
What... is going to happen to us...

980
01:02:49,986 --> 01:02:51,685
...if we stay in this place?

981
01:02:51,687 --> 01:02:53,554
What's going to happen to us

when we decide to leave?

983
01:02:54,991 --> 01:02:56,891
I mean, we already got
fucking demonic pictures

984
01:02:56,893 --> 01:02:59,226
and shit, like, all over
the fucking walls and shit!

985
01:02:59,228 --> 01:03:00,295
What the hell's up with that?

986
01:03:00,297 --> 01:03:03,063
What are you guys talking
about? What happened?

987
01:03:03,065 --> 01:03:05,232
Nothing. He's overreacting.

988
01:03:05,234 --> 01:03:07,935
I've had enough. 20 days. I'm done.

989
01:03:07,937 --> 01:03:12,339
Yeah, well the deal with
the network is 21 days,

990
01:03:12,341 --> 01:03:14,643
and we're staying here 21 days.

991
01:03:14,645 --> 01:03:16,611
- I don't care!
- Jesus Christ.

992
01:03:16,613 --> 01:03:19,681
I want to get out of this
fucking evil-ass house!

993
01:03:19,683 --> 01:03:22,750
- You're overreacting.
- I mean, fuck, man!

994
01:03:22,752 --> 01:03:26,353
The-the-the kid. He-he was in
a fucking car and he-he died,

995
01:03:26,355 --> 01:03:27,755
and now apparently

996
01:03:27,757 --> 01:03:30,158
he's showing up at our fucking door step,

997
01:03:30,160 --> 01:03:31,560
pronounced dead!

998
01:03:31,562 --> 01:03:33,627
It's not the same kid.

999
01:03:33,629 --> 01:03:35,964
Some other fucking kid
who lives around here

1000
01:03:35,966 --> 01:03:37,199
who looks like him.

1001
01:03:37,201 --> 01:03:40,000
Look at the fucking pictures! It's him!

1002
01:03:40,002 --> 01:03:42,370
He fucking died and now his
soul, or whatever the fuck

1003
01:03:42,372 --> 01:03:44,406
is going on in this god damn house,

1004
01:03:44,408 --> 01:03:45,739
is living in here!

1005
01:03:45,741 --> 01:03:49,310
His soul, or his ghost, or whatever, Kurt,

1006
01:03:49,312 --> 01:03:51,612
is not in this house.

1007
01:03:51,614 --> 01:03:53,547
It's not him!

1008
01:03:53,549 --> 01:03:55,285
It can't be him!

1009
01:03:56,053 --> 01:03:58,189
- Drop it!
- Fuck!

1010
01:03:59,189 --> 01:04:00,591
Nothing happened.

1011
01:04:01,123 --> 01:04:02,125
Yeah...

1012
01:04:02,725 --> 01:04:04,458
- He's so freaked out!
- He's freaking out!

1013
01:04:04,460 --> 01:04:06,228
He's always freaking out.

1014
01:04:06,230 --> 01:04:08,529
All through college he freaked out.

1015
01:04:08,531 --> 01:04:10,799
I am not freaking out!

1016
01:04:10,801 --> 01:04:12,500
Just calm down, dude.

1017
01:04:12,502 --> 01:04:13,935
I just don't want to
stay in this house, dude.

1018
01:04:13,937 --> 01:04:17,739
Just chill out. We have one more day.

1019
01:04:17,741 --> 01:04:20,507
One day, dude. Please.

1020
01:04:20,509 --> 01:04:22,412
Get a grip!

1021
01:05:24,440 --> 01:05:26,308
You're calling me on your cell?

1022
01:05:26,310 --> 01:05:27,942
Check the monitor.

1023
01:05:27,944 --> 01:05:29,176
What's happening in your bedroom?

1024
01:05:29,178 --> 01:05:30,547
Bedroom One.

1025
01:05:33,450 --> 01:05:36,917
Something or someone
just went in that room.

1026
01:05:38,555 --> 01:05:40,591
Fine, fine, fine. Hold on.

1027
01:05:44,527 --> 01:05:46,226
You know you could've just
probably come down here yourself

1028
01:05:46,228 --> 01:05:48,131
if you wanted to.

1029
01:05:53,602 --> 01:05:55,005
In my room?

1030
01:05:57,741 --> 01:05:59,341
I'm looking at the monitor now, Shauna,

1031
01:05:59,343 --> 01:06:01,279
there's nothing in there.

1032
01:06:03,480 --> 01:06:04,812
Do you want to talk to Kurt

1033
01:06:04,814 --> 01:06:06,517
'cause you don't believe me?

1034
01:06:07,651 --> 01:06:10,051
Oh, my god. I'm gonna
show you the playback.

1035
01:06:10,053 --> 01:06:12,623
You seriously are gonna have
to buy me lunch after this.

1036
01:06:14,623 --> 01:06:16,424
- Here.
- What?

1037
01:06:16,426 --> 01:06:18,228
Shauna has a question for you.

1038
01:06:24,267 --> 01:06:25,502
Hello?

1039
01:06:28,038 --> 01:06:30,071
What are you talkin' about?

1040
01:06:34,111 --> 01:06:35,944
Everything's cool, Shauna, there's...

1041
01:06:35,946 --> 01:06:37,978
...there's no one in the room.

1042
01:06:37,980 --> 01:06:39,249
Yeah.

1043
01:06:40,082 --> 01:06:41,618
Okay. I'm here.

1044
01:07:18,020 --> 01:07:20,357
Oh, my God.

1045
01:07:24,393 --> 01:07:26,263
How?

1046
01:07:29,131 --> 01:07:30,832
How did this happen?

1047
01:07:37,506 --> 01:07:38,808
That's me.

1048
01:07:43,647 --> 01:07:45,049
Oh, my God!

1049
01:07:48,819 --> 01:07:49,984
Jesus Christ.

1050
01:07:49,986 --> 01:07:52,453
Let me out of here!

1051
01:07:52,455 --> 01:07:54,758
Let me out!

1052
01:07:59,062 --> 01:08:00,864
- Shauna!
- Let me out!

1053
01:08:05,167 --> 01:08:06,569
What's going on?

1054
01:08:11,774 --> 01:08:12,942
What the fuck?

1055
01:08:15,578 --> 01:08:17,480
Holy mother of Christ.

1056
01:08:19,448 --> 01:08:22,549
Those fucking photos, dude.
They're of me as a fucking kid.

1057
01:08:30,292 --> 01:08:32,694
How-how the fuck did these get here?

1058
01:08:32,696 --> 01:08:33,928
Oh, my God.

1059
01:08:33,930 --> 01:08:35,230
How did these fucking get here, dude?

1060
01:08:35,232 --> 01:08:38,301
It's fucking impossible! How
is this happening in here?

1061
01:08:40,269 --> 01:08:41,569
What the fuck?!

1062
01:08:41,571 --> 01:08:44,271
What the fuck is
happening with this place?!

1063
01:08:44,273 --> 01:08:46,509
What the fuck, man?!

1064
01:08:47,544 --> 01:08:51,348
It-it-it...
it's wet.

1065
01:08:52,215 --> 01:08:53,751
The other night...

1066
01:08:55,318 --> 01:08:59,323
...we found the photos... of us downstairs.

1067
01:09:01,690 --> 01:09:03,894
They had the same bloody circles on 'em

1068
01:09:06,129 --> 01:09:07,665
I didn't wanna frighten you.

1069
01:09:08,764 --> 01:09:10,063
I burned them.

1070
01:09:10,065 --> 01:09:12,499
I hate you! Why would you
not tell me about that?!

1071
01:09:12,501 --> 01:09:14,535
I didn't wanna scare you!

1072
01:09:14,537 --> 01:09:15,973
Shauna!

1073
01:09:16,505 --> 01:09:18,039
Shauna, wait!

1074
01:09:18,041 --> 01:09:19,574
Wait! I can explain it to you!

1075
01:09:19,576 --> 01:09:21,843
I just didn't want to scare you!

1076
01:09:25,482 --> 01:09:27,347
Jesus Christ, Shauna!

1077
01:09:27,349 --> 01:09:28,516
Stop it!

1078
01:09:28,518 --> 01:09:30,054
What the hell is wrong with you?!

1079
01:09:31,153 --> 01:09:33,620
Bullshit! We are so fucking outta here!

1080
01:09:33,622 --> 01:09:36,026
Jacob!

1081
01:09:37,426 --> 01:09:39,729
What the fuck, Jacob?!

1082
01:09:40,563 --> 01:09:43,097
Are you out of your mind?!

1083
01:09:43,099 --> 01:09:44,268
Look...

1084
01:09:44,768 --> 01:09:46,500
I know...

1085
01:09:46,502 --> 01:09:49,704
...a lot of really crazy
shit has been happening.

1086
01:09:49,706 --> 01:09:50,938
Really?

1087
01:09:50,940 --> 01:09:52,507
You fucking think so?

1088
01:09:52,509 --> 01:09:54,145
But we're okay.

1089
01:09:54,978 --> 01:09:57,311
Nobody's hurt, nobody's dead.

1090
01:09:57,313 --> 01:10:00,380
Jacob, we're not dead yet!

1091
01:10:00,382 --> 01:10:02,683
What the fuck are you gonna do, huh?

1092
01:10:02,685 --> 01:10:05,018
What the fuck are you gonna do?

1093
01:10:05,020 --> 01:10:07,588
You're gonna shoot us? Huh?!

1094
01:10:07,590 --> 01:10:08,957
You're gonna fucking try and kill us

1095
01:10:08,959 --> 01:10:10,325
if we try to leave?

1096
01:10:10,327 --> 01:10:12,392
Is that what you're gonna do?

1097
01:10:12,394 --> 01:10:13,460
Shoot you.

1098
01:10:13,462 --> 01:10:14,931
Don't be fucking stupid, Kurt.

1099
01:10:19,769 --> 01:10:21,369
Oh, fuck!

1100
01:10:21,371 --> 01:10:24,871
Goddamn it, Jacob! You
took our cell phones too?

1101
01:10:24,873 --> 01:10:26,410
As I said...

1102
01:10:27,376 --> 01:10:29,345
...we only have 12 more hours...

1103
01:10:30,613 --> 01:10:36,683
...and I'm not have gone
through all this time and shit...

1104
01:10:36,685 --> 01:10:38,389
...for nothing!

1105
01:10:51,134 --> 01:10:52,569
Don't!

1106
01:10:53,903 --> 01:10:55,139
Don't touch.

1107
01:11:02,011 --> 01:11:03,581
Just 12 more hours...

1108
01:11:05,547 --> 01:11:06,951
...and it's all over.

1109
01:11:20,229 --> 01:11:21,130
It's okay.

1110
01:11:22,131 --> 01:11:23,466
He's not gonna hurt us.

1111
01:11:25,301 --> 01:11:28,072
It's gonna be okay. All right? Okay?

1112
01:12:23,859 --> 01:12:26,093
You're filming this right now?

1113
01:12:26,095 --> 01:12:26,763
Seriously?

1114
01:12:27,863 --> 01:12:29,696
It's the only thing that's keeping me sane

1115
01:12:29,698 --> 01:12:30,701
at this point.

1116
01:12:31,801 --> 01:12:34,569
Also, wanted to make sure
that we record everything.

1117
01:12:34,571 --> 01:12:36,607
In case our evil friend comes back.

1118
01:12:37,773 --> 01:12:40,343
I'm not talking about any of the ghosts...

1119
01:12:41,810 --> 01:12:44,344
...but rather, your fucking boyfriend.

1120
01:12:44,346 --> 01:12:45,916
Ex-boyfriend.

1121
01:12:48,251 --> 01:12:50,752
Where is that demonic prick anyway?

1122
01:12:50,754 --> 01:12:51,921
In his room.

1123
01:12:52,654 --> 01:12:54,524
Fucking asshole locked the door.

1124
01:13:06,135 --> 01:13:07,504
Look.

1125
01:13:08,537 --> 01:13:09,772
It's 12 o'clock.

1126
01:13:11,273 --> 01:13:13,743
- So?
- You don't know what that means?

1127
01:13:14,943 --> 01:13:16,412
21 days.

1128
01:13:17,913 --> 01:13:19,246
We made it.

1129
01:13:19,248 --> 01:13:21,719
Everything's gonna be okay. All right?

1130
01:13:23,787 --> 01:13:26,686
The bank rep is gonna be here in six hours

1131
01:13:26,688 --> 01:13:28,823
to let us out of this fucking place.

1132
01:13:28,825 --> 01:13:32,759
But six hours feels like
an eternity in this house.

1133
01:13:35,898 --> 01:13:37,999
Listen. We're gonna be fine.

1134
01:13:39,669 --> 01:13:41,936
Where is it coming from?

1135
01:13:41,938 --> 01:13:43,971
What room is that coming from?

1136
01:13:43,973 --> 01:13:45,173
It's coming from the living room.

1137
01:13:45,175 --> 01:13:47,010
Here, hold this. Hold this, okay?

1138
01:13:48,877 --> 01:13:51,579
Oh, Kurt, please just leave it alone.

1139
01:13:51,581 --> 01:13:53,580
It's okay. Look. I'm gonna be back for you.

1140
01:13:53,582 --> 01:13:55,549
I promise. Just stay here, okay?

1141
01:13:55,551 --> 01:13:58,255
Everything's gonna be okay. I promise.

1142
01:14:03,626 --> 01:14:05,028
Where is it coming from?

1143
01:14:14,737 --> 01:14:15,869
The fuck?

1144
01:14:22,211 --> 01:14:23,578
- Your phone.
- Where is it?

1145
01:14:23,580 --> 01:14:24,915
Get your phone.

1146
01:14:33,456 --> 01:14:34,621
What the fuck is that?

1147
01:14:34,623 --> 01:14:37,225
Kurt, please just don't go any closer.

1148
01:14:37,227 --> 01:14:39,694
Please don't go any closer.

1149
01:14:39,696 --> 01:14:41,832
Please don't. No.

1150
01:14:55,377 --> 01:14:56,576
Where the hell did she go?

1151
01:14:56,578 --> 01:14:59,179
- I don't know.
- Where the fuck did she go?

1152
01:14:59,181 --> 01:15:02,019
I swear she fucking came
in here. I swear to God.

1153
01:15:07,556 --> 01:15:08,755
Oh, my God,

1154
01:15:08,757 --> 01:15:10,394
Where is she?

1155
01:15:14,264 --> 01:15:16,467
What the fuck? Do you see that?

1156
01:15:17,500 --> 01:15:18,902
What?

1157
01:15:22,304 --> 01:15:24,841
That... can't...

1158
01:15:28,443 --> 01:15:29,610
Oh, my God.

1159
01:15:29,612 --> 01:15:31,177
What?

1160
01:15:31,179 --> 01:15:34,214
That's-that-that's the girl we
just saw on the rocking chair.

1161
01:15:34,216 --> 01:15:36,150
She lived here 35 years ago.

1162
01:15:36,152 --> 01:15:38,922
That's... that's fucking Tricia Warner.

1163
01:15:40,355 --> 01:15:42,690
But that's impossible.

1164
01:15:42,692 --> 01:15:44,060
Fuck!

1165
01:16:00,510 --> 01:16:02,243
What the hell is happening?

1166
01:16:08,216 --> 01:16:11,518
Call 911! Call 911!

1167
01:16:13,389 --> 01:16:14,892
Call 911 now!

1168
01:16:15,558 --> 01:16:17,124
Try-try-try
calling again!

1169
01:16:17,126 --> 01:16:18,959
Call anyone! I don't fucking care!

1170
01:16:18,961 --> 01:16:20,695
- I can't see!
- Check your phone book!

1171
01:16:20,697 --> 01:16:21,829
You gotta see something in there!

1172
01:16:21,831 --> 01:16:22,963
Check!

1173
01:16:22,965 --> 01:16:24,731
I-I-I'm trying!
I'm trying!

1174
01:16:24,733 --> 01:16:27,168
It's ringing. It's ringing. It's ringing.

1175
01:16:36,679 --> 01:16:37,848
Come on.

1176
01:16:38,915 --> 01:16:42,083
- <i>Hello?</i>
- Hello? Who is this?

1177
01:16:42,085 --> 01:16:43,687
Please! We need help!

1178
01:16:44,854 --> 01:16:49,390
<i>This-this is Carolyn
Warner. Who is this?</i>

1179
01:16:49,392 --> 01:16:51,025
Oh, my God.

1180
01:16:51,027 --> 01:16:52,325
<i>Hello?</i>

1181
01:16:52,327 --> 01:16:56,163
Uh, Carolyn Warner who used to live here?

1182
01:16:56,165 --> 01:16:57,964
<i>Who-who is this?</i>

1183
01:16:57,966 --> 01:17:01,435
We're-we're at your
old house on Cedar Road!

1184
01:17:01,437 --> 01:17:03,904
<i>I have nothing to say to you.</i>

1185
01:17:03,906 --> 01:17:07,441
No, no, no! Please!
Don't hang up the phone!

1186
01:17:07,443 --> 01:17:09,377
We need your help! Please, please.

1187
01:17:09,379 --> 01:17:11,779
Listen very, very carefully.

1188
01:17:11,781 --> 01:17:15,348
Your daughter is in this house with us.

1189
01:17:15,350 --> 01:17:16,651
Do you understand me?

1190
01:17:16,653 --> 01:17:18,518
Your daughter when
she's eleven-years-old

1191
01:17:18,520 --> 01:17:22,255
is in this house with us right now!

1192
01:17:22,257 --> 01:17:25,261
<i>My daughter is dead!</i>

1193
01:17:26,129 --> 01:17:27,527
What?

1194
01:17:27,529 --> 01:17:30,463
<i>She-she died an hour ago</i>

1195
01:17:30,465 --> 01:17:34,334
<i>in St. Mary's Psychiatric Hospital.</i>

1196
01:17:34,336 --> 01:17:36,404
Then why is she here?!

1197
01:17:36,406 --> 01:17:37,838
What is she doing...

1198
01:17:37,840 --> 01:17:40,210
What happened to this house?!

1199
01:17:41,778 --> 01:17:46,246
<i>She's dead. You... you
uncovered the mirrors!</i>

1200
01:17:46,248 --> 01:17:48,716
What? What do you mean?

1201
01:17:48,718 --> 01:17:50,319
<i>The mirrors!</i>

1202
01:17:51,787 --> 01:17:56,624
<i>They unleash the evil that
resides in that house.</i>

1203
01:17:56,626 --> 01:17:58,526
<i>Whoever uncovers them,</i>

1204
01:17:58,528 --> 01:18:02,463
<i>which my daughter
did 35 years ago...</i>

1205
01:18:02,465 --> 01:18:06,200
<i>...gets possessed by
the evil, the demon,</i>

1206
01:18:06,202 --> 01:18:10,271
<i>and he beckoned them back to
reclaim all of their souls!</i>

1207
01:18:10,273 --> 01:18:12,940
Well, what am I supposed to do?

1208
01:18:12,942 --> 01:18:14,544
<i>Cover the mirrors!</i>

1209
01:18:15,377 --> 01:18:18,745
<i>And don't talk to the entities!</i>

1210
01:18:18,747 --> 01:18:21,082
<i>What-what do you mean?!</i>

1211
01:18:21,084 --> 01:18:24,451
<i>Oh, why didn't you
leave when you could?</i>

1212
01:18:24,453 --> 01:18:26,553
Please just call the police!

1213
01:18:26,555 --> 01:18:29,992
Call 911! Help us get out of here!

1214
01:18:30,859 --> 01:18:32,793
It's too late.

1215
01:18:32,795 --> 01:18:36,864
No! No, it's-it's not too
late! It's not too late!

1216
01:18:36,866 --> 01:18:39,866
<i>21 days.</i>

1217
01:18:39,868 --> 01:18:41,435
No, please!

1218
01:18:41,437 --> 01:18:44,472
Help us! Help us! We need your help!

1219
01:18:44,474 --> 01:18:47,277
<i>May God have mercy on your soul!</i>

1220
01:18:49,345 --> 01:18:50,578
Hello?!

1221
01:18:53,715 --> 01:18:55,384
No!

1222
01:18:55,852 --> 01:18:57,685
No! She hung up!

1223
01:18:57,687 --> 01:18:58,918
Fucking out of here. Hold this. Hold this.

1224
01:18:58,920 --> 01:19:00,687
Okay? All right?

1225
01:19:00,689 --> 01:19:03,124
Kurt, where are you
going? What are you doing?!

1226
01:19:06,496 --> 01:19:08,361
Kurt, where are you?!

1227
01:19:12,300 --> 01:19:15,136
Help!

1228
01:19:15,138 --> 01:19:16,907
Help us!

1229
01:19:17,639 --> 01:19:20,374
Why won't the windows break?!

1230
01:19:20,376 --> 01:19:22,579
Why won't they break?!

1231
01:19:27,349 --> 01:19:29,016
Someone will come get us.

1232
01:19:31,086 --> 01:19:33,389
Someone will come get us out.

1233
01:19:39,194 --> 01:19:40,796
Kurt...

1234
01:19:42,564 --> 01:19:44,233
Where are you?

1235
01:19:48,737 --> 01:19:51,207
Kurt...

1236
01:19:53,576 --> 01:19:54,578
Kurt?

1237
01:20:01,783 --> 01:20:03,519
Oh, my God!

1238
01:20:05,621 --> 01:20:07,424
What the fuck was that?

1239
01:20:23,471 --> 01:20:24,804
Hey.

1240
01:20:24,806 --> 01:20:26,673
Oh, my God!

1241
01:20:26,675 --> 01:20:28,642
Shauna, let me see the camera.

1242
01:20:28,644 --> 01:20:30,009
You scared the shit out of me!

1243
01:20:30,011 --> 01:20:32,512
- Hold the flashlight.
- Okay.

1244
01:20:32,514 --> 01:20:33,883
You take the light.

1245
01:20:35,718 --> 01:20:38,052
Oh, my God, Kurt I'm so scared!

1246
01:20:38,054 --> 01:20:40,157
So scared right now!

1247
01:20:41,556 --> 01:20:43,160
Wait, shh.

1248
01:20:44,760 --> 01:20:46,329
Do you hear that?

1249
01:20:46,895 --> 01:20:48,364
Jacob?!

1250
01:20:48,930 --> 01:20:51,268
Jacob, is that you?!

1251
01:20:52,535 --> 01:20:54,304
We have to cover up the mirrors.

1252
01:20:55,237 --> 01:20:57,471
Right now, Kurt, we just gotta get these...

1253
01:20:57,473 --> 01:20:59,138
Jacob!

1254
01:21:00,376 --> 01:21:03,076
Go! Let's go! Come on!

1255
01:21:06,381 --> 01:21:08,518
Oh, my God.

1256
01:21:09,818 --> 01:21:11,051
Fuck!

1257
01:21:11,053 --> 01:21:12,785
Holy shit!

1258
01:21:12,787 --> 01:21:14,454
- Shauna...
- I need your help!

1259
01:21:14,456 --> 01:21:15,688
Fuck! Fuck!

1260
01:21:15,690 --> 01:21:16,660
Ow!

1261
01:21:20,696 --> 01:21:22,265
Come on! Come on!

1262
01:21:26,969 --> 01:21:28,401
Come fucking here!

1263
01:21:28,403 --> 01:21:30,706
It's no good, it's no good.

1264
01:21:32,642 --> 01:21:34,708
Okay, they're covered. Come with me!

1265
01:21:38,046 --> 01:21:38,978
Fuck!

1266
01:21:38,980 --> 01:21:40,446
Jacob!

1267
01:21:40,448 --> 01:21:42,115
Jacob!

1268
01:21:42,117 --> 01:21:43,417
Are you in there?!

1269
01:21:43,419 --> 01:21:44,955
Jacob!

1270
01:21:46,054 --> 01:21:47,788
Hey! Look-loo-look!
Okay. I can-I can...

1271
01:21:47,790 --> 01:21:49,556
I can bring it up on the, uh,

1272
01:21:49,558 --> 01:21:51,158
fucking surveillance camera, okay?

1273
01:21:51,160 --> 01:21:52,325
All right?

1274
01:21:57,065 --> 01:21:59,566
Oh, no!

1275
01:21:59,568 --> 01:22:02,335
Jacob!

1276
01:22:02,337 --> 01:22:03,771
What are they doing with him?!
What are they doing with him?!

1277
01:22:03,773 --> 01:22:05,204
They're in there with you!

1278
01:22:05,206 --> 01:22:06,874
Jacob, they're in there with you!

1279
01:22:06,876 --> 01:22:11,011
You have to get out! You have to get out!

1280
01:22:11,013 --> 01:22:12,616
Oh, my God!

1281
01:22:13,715 --> 01:22:15,649
Jacob, seriously!

1282
01:22:15,651 --> 01:22:17,183
Please just leave the room!

1283
01:22:17,185 --> 01:22:19,052
Do not talk to them, okay?

1284
01:22:19,054 --> 01:22:20,820
Do not talk to them! Just...

1285
01:22:20,822 --> 01:22:23,624
Just fucking stop doing this!

1286
01:22:23,626 --> 01:22:25,292
They're fucking coming towards the door!

1287
01:22:25,294 --> 01:22:27,293
Shauna! They're fucking coming!

1288
01:22:27,295 --> 01:22:28,995
Come on! Get out!

1289
01:22:28,997 --> 01:22:30,767
Shauna! Get away from the door!

1290
01:22:32,001 --> 01:22:33,100
All right, we gotta block the door!

1291
01:22:33,102 --> 01:22:34,101
We gotta block it! Pick this up!

1292
01:22:34,103 --> 01:22:35,835
Got it! Come on!

1293
01:22:35,837 --> 01:22:37,170
Right there!

1294
01:22:37,172 --> 01:22:38,304
Fuck!

1295
01:22:41,344 --> 01:22:42,575
Go!

1296
01:22:43,813 --> 01:22:45,614
Oh, my God!

1297
01:22:46,482 --> 01:22:48,682
Oh, fuck! Shit!

1298
01:22:50,486 --> 01:22:51,819
Fucking go!

1299
01:23:05,033 --> 01:23:07,500
What is happening?!

1300
01:23:07,502 --> 01:23:08,638
Oh!

1301
01:23:09,671 --> 01:23:11,507
Oh, my God.

1302
01:23:15,377 --> 01:23:17,380
Kurt, don't go any closer!

1303
01:23:20,648 --> 01:23:22,117
Please, no!

1304
01:23:23,685 --> 01:23:27,087
Jacob, what's wrong with you?!

1305
01:23:27,089 --> 01:23:30,593
What's happening?! Why are you doing this?!

1306
01:23:35,130 --> 01:23:37,166
Oh, my God!

1307
01:23:39,602 --> 01:23:42,069
Oh! Oh, my God!

1308
01:23:42,071 --> 01:23:43,637
Oh, my God!

1309
01:23:43,639 --> 01:23:45,571
I wanna get out!

1310
01:23:45,573 --> 01:23:47,743
Let me out of here!

1311
01:23:56,684 --> 01:23:58,254
Please work...

1312
01:24:11,901 --> 01:24:14,034
Our father, who art in Heaven,

1313
01:24:14,036 --> 01:24:15,436
hallowed be thy name.

1314
01:24:15,438 --> 01:24:17,170
Thy kingdom come, thy will be done

1315
01:24:17,172 --> 01:24:18,672
on Earth as it is in Heaven.

1316
01:24:18,674 --> 01:24:20,240
Give us this day our daily bread,

1317
01:24:20,242 --> 01:24:21,909
and forgive us our trespasses

1318
01:24:21,911 --> 01:24:24,381
as we forgive those
who trespass against us.

1319
01:24:25,514 --> 01:24:28,214
And lead us not into temptation...

1320
01:24:28,216 --> 01:24:31,017
...but deliver us from evil.

1321
01:24:31,019 --> 01:24:32,121
Amen.

1322
01:25:33,482 --> 01:25:34,617
Hello?

1323
01:25:35,084 --> 01:25:36,650
Hello!

1324
01:25:36,652 --> 01:25:38,451
We're here to let you out!

1325
01:25:50,099 --> 01:25:51,468
Guys?!

1326
01:25:52,201 --> 01:25:53,603
Hello!

1327
01:26:13,822 --> 01:26:14,920
Where are they?

1328
01:26:14,922 --> 01:26:16,358
Maybe they're still sleeping.

1329
01:26:17,893 --> 01:26:19,361
Let's check upstairs.

1330
01:26:26,669 --> 01:26:27,836
Hello?

1331
01:26:36,211 --> 01:26:37,744
Look at this.

1332
01:26:37,746 --> 01:26:40,112
The bag. They packed.

1333
01:26:40,114 --> 01:26:41,315
Maybe they forgot it?

1334
01:26:41,317 --> 01:26:43,350
Carl, there's no sign of them leaving.

1335
01:26:43,352 --> 01:26:45,084
The house was barricaded shut

1336
01:26:45,086 --> 01:26:46,723
and their car is still here.

1337
01:26:49,224 --> 01:26:50,225
They're gone.

1338
01:26:51,559 --> 01:26:53,526
Well, what the hell
happened to them then, Joe?

1339
01:26:53,528 --> 01:26:54,994
I don't know.

1340
01:26:54,996 --> 01:26:57,399
God damn it, Carl! Stop filming!

1341
01:26:59,167 --> 01:27:01,368
Carl, come on! We need to go!

1342
01:27:01,370 --> 01:27:02,971
Yeah, yeah. I'm coming!

1343
01:27:26,327 --> 01:27:27,830
Holy shit.

1344
01:27:30,965 --> 01:27:32,199
The fuck?

1345
01:27:53,721 --> 01:27:55,422
Carl, I'm not gonna say it again!

1346
01:27:55,424 --> 01:27:56,923
We're leaving now!

1347
01:27:56,925 --> 01:27:58,758
Coming! I'm coming!

1348
01:28:18,351 --> 01:28:23,351
