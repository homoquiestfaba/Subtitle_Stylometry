1
00:00:35,746 --> 00:00:37,475
Woman's voice:
Hello, my name is Goody,

2
00:00:37,514 --> 00:00:41,177
and in 1841, I was bitten
by a stem vampire.

3
00:00:41,218 --> 00:00:43,686
A stem is able to awaken
the victims

4
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:45,347
they choose not to drain.

5
00:00:45,389 --> 00:00:47,050
Normally, this would be
one of those tales

6
00:00:47,090 --> 00:00:49,354
of gore and homicidal urges,

7
00:00:49,393 --> 00:00:51,293
but I've always looked
on the bright side.

8
00:00:51,328 --> 00:00:53,125
So I learned to live
on animal blood.

9
00:00:53,163 --> 00:00:54,528
And having eternal life

10
00:00:54,565 --> 00:00:57,398
gave me extra years
with my loved ones.

11
00:00:57,434 --> 00:00:59,732
Nighttime used to be
dull and dark,

12
00:00:59,770 --> 00:01:02,068
but things got a lot better
in the '80s.

13
00:01:02,105 --> 00:01:04,471
Oh, the 1880s, that is.

14
00:01:04,508 --> 00:01:07,033
The Industrial Revolution
gave us electricity

15
00:01:07,077 --> 00:01:08,567
and light bulbs.

16
00:01:08,612 --> 00:01:11,172
And suddenly, nights were
as bright as daytime.

17
00:01:11,214 --> 00:01:12,772
Telephones replaced letters,

18
00:01:12,816 --> 00:01:15,114
and the new subways let
you travel the whole city

19
00:01:15,152 --> 00:01:17,677
and still be in your coffin
by sunrise.

20
00:01:17,721 --> 00:01:20,849
In the 1920s,
things really turned modern.

21
00:01:20,891 --> 00:01:22,688
Skirts got shorter,

22
00:01:22,726 --> 00:01:25,889
jazz babies and flappers
owned the night.

23
00:01:25,929 --> 00:01:27,419
The world belonged
to the young,

24
00:01:27,464 --> 00:01:29,591
and I was an expert
at being young.

25
00:01:29,633 --> 00:01:31,464
And then came
my favorite invention...

26
00:01:31,501 --> 00:01:32,798
flickers.

27
00:01:32,836 --> 00:01:35,464
Chaplin, Keaton,
Cagney...

28
00:01:35,505 --> 00:01:38,065
and in movies,
they never got any older.

29
00:01:38,108 --> 00:01:39,473
I could relate.

30
00:01:39,509 --> 00:01:42,410
In the 1960s, I messed up.

31
00:01:42,446 --> 00:01:43,811
I let my guard down

32
00:01:43,847 --> 00:01:46,543
and I stupidly let myself
fall in love.

33
00:01:46,583 --> 00:01:48,949
After that, things started
to go downhill.

34
00:01:48,986 --> 00:01:52,080
In the '70s, I kinda lost
interest in dating.

35
00:01:52,122 --> 00:01:54,852
But in the '90s,
my stem turned Stacy.

36
00:01:54,891 --> 00:01:58,258
She was kind of lost
and I took care of her.

37
00:01:58,295 --> 00:02:00,786
I taught her to get hometown
soil for her coffin,

38
00:02:00,831 --> 00:02:02,992
how to use
hypnotic powers,

39
00:02:03,033 --> 00:02:05,297
and how to find the jugular
on a rodent.

40
00:02:05,335 --> 00:02:08,202
And she taught
me about e-mail,

41
00:02:08,238 --> 00:02:10,798
Napster,
and this great group,

42
00:02:10,841 --> 00:02:12,240
Green Day.

43
00:02:12,275 --> 00:02:13,640
So we have lots of fun.

44
00:02:13,677 --> 00:02:16,077
We party with normal kids,
we go to college.

45
00:02:16,113 --> 00:02:18,343
I've got over 10,000 credits.

46
00:02:18,382 --> 00:02:20,612
I could graduate if
it wasn't during the day.

47
00:02:21,918 --> 00:02:24,113
I love having a friend,

48
00:02:24,154 --> 00:02:26,418
or "bestie," as she calls it.

49
00:02:26,456 --> 00:02:28,447
And, aw,
look how cute she is.

50
00:02:30,093 --> 00:02:32,152
- Hey, Goody.
(phone beeps)

51
00:02:32,195 --> 00:02:34,493
- Goody, wake up. It's sunset.
(phone rings)

52
00:02:34,531 --> 00:02:35,930
Goody's voice:
The only bad thing about Stacy

53
00:02:35,966 --> 00:02:37,456
are her practical jokes,

54
00:02:37,501 --> 00:02:40,800
which she thinks are way funnier
than they actually are.

55
00:02:40,837 --> 00:02:42,270
Goody:
What?

56
00:02:42,305 --> 00:02:43,829
No, you didn't.

57
00:02:43,874 --> 00:02:45,865
Come on, let me out.

58
00:02:49,579 --> 00:02:52,104
- You got me
- Again.

59
00:02:52,149 --> 00:02:53,741
(Stacy laughs)

60
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:59,554
Hurry, I've got an 8:00 class.

61
00:03:01,425 --> 00:03:03,359
Hey, Stacy.
Your friend from Boston

62
00:03:03,393 --> 00:03:04,792
sent your hometown soil.

63
00:03:04,828 --> 00:03:06,352
Oh, thank God.

64
00:03:06,396 --> 00:03:09,160
I hardly have any left.
My back has been killing me.

65
00:03:12,369 --> 00:03:14,599
"We're sorry but
your package has

66
00:03:14,638 --> 00:03:16,606
accidentally been
harmed in delivery."

67
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:19,473
I think the Post Office
x-rays everything now,

68
00:03:19,509 --> 00:03:21,477
and this looked suspicious
so they opened it.

69
00:03:21,511 --> 00:03:23,001
But this is just dirt.

70
00:03:23,046 --> 00:03:25,344
Yeah, but you know
Homeland Security.

71
00:03:25,382 --> 00:03:28,249
Man, the terrorists ruined
things for everybody.

72
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:33,282
"Visit us at www..."

73
00:03:33,323 --> 00:03:34,756
why do they call it visiting?

74
00:03:34,791 --> 00:03:37,885
Isn't it more like "type us
a letter on the computer"?

75
00:03:37,928 --> 00:03:40,726
Visiting is when
you go somewhere.

76
00:03:40,764 --> 00:03:42,425
Yeah, you're at one place
on the Internet,

77
00:03:42,466 --> 00:03:43,933
and then
you go someplace else.

78
00:03:43,967 --> 00:03:45,958
- That doesn't make any sense.
- Yes, it does.

79
00:03:46,002 --> 00:03:48,027
So if you're reading a book
and you turn the page,

80
00:03:48,071 --> 00:03:49,800
are you visiting
another page?

81
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:53,367
Hold on.
You still can't find your mouth

82
00:03:53,410 --> 00:03:54,934
- without a mirror?
- Thank you.

83
00:04:00,317 --> 00:04:02,148
Sunrise is at 6:40.

84
00:04:02,185 --> 00:04:03,743
You know, I put that app
in your phone.

85
00:04:03,787 --> 00:04:05,118
You don't need the almanac.

86
00:04:05,155 --> 00:04:07,282
I like my almanac.

87
00:04:08,291 --> 00:04:09,758
What's with the mom jeans?

88
00:04:09,793 --> 00:04:11,954
- Jeans are jeans.
- Are you kidding?

89
00:04:11,995 --> 00:04:14,589
Jeans mark your age
more than a birth certificate.

90
00:04:14,631 --> 00:04:15,689
(scoffs)

91
00:04:15,732 --> 00:04:17,427
Trade shoes.
At least my gladiators

92
00:04:17,467 --> 00:04:18,957
will get you in
the right millennium.

93
00:04:19,002 --> 00:04:21,266
- Those are cute.
- Race you.

94
00:04:21,304 --> 00:04:23,169
Oh!

95
00:04:23,206 --> 00:04:25,197
(Goody groaning)

96
00:04:26,443 --> 00:04:29,276
(grunts)

97
00:04:29,312 --> 00:04:31,280
- Took you long enough.
- Well, that didn't count.

98
00:04:31,314 --> 00:04:33,612
- These aren't my shoes.
- Excuses, excuses.

99
00:04:33,650 --> 00:04:34,947
Oh, for goodness' sake.

100
00:04:34,985 --> 00:04:36,850
- What time does your class end?
- 9:30.

101
00:04:36,887 --> 00:04:38,354
Okay, then I'll meet
you at work.

102
00:04:38,388 --> 00:04:39,753
(rat squeaking)

103
00:04:39,790 --> 00:04:41,655
Goody: Oh, God.
Where are you going?

104
00:04:43,093 --> 00:04:44,822
(groans)
Come back here.

105
00:04:44,861 --> 00:04:47,853
(rat squeals)
- Goody!

106
00:04:47,898 --> 00:04:50,696
Cradle of Filth, Ozzy Osbourne,
The Cure...

107
00:04:50,734 --> 00:04:52,463
Ooh, where?

108
00:04:52,502 --> 00:04:55,630
Oh, no. It's one of those
daytime festival things.

109
00:04:55,672 --> 00:04:57,162
(groans)
Whose idiot idea was it

110
00:04:57,207 --> 00:04:59,038
to have rock concerts
during the day?

111
00:04:59,075 --> 00:05:00,940
(groans, hisses)

112
00:05:05,215 --> 00:05:08,844
Mmm.
Let's check the traps.

113
00:05:08,885 --> 00:05:11,046
Ugh, rats will eat anything.

114
00:05:11,087 --> 00:05:12,884
(squeaking)

115
00:05:16,193 --> 00:05:18,024
Oh, dead one.

116
00:05:18,061 --> 00:05:20,188
Oh, trap got him?

117
00:05:20,230 --> 00:05:22,960
I think the artificial
sweeteners gave him cancer.

118
00:05:22,999 --> 00:05:25,661
Woman's voice:
53rd Street.

119
00:05:25,702 --> 00:05:26,964
53rd Street.

120
00:05:27,003 --> 00:05:29,130
Woman's voice:
And 6th Avenue.

121
00:05:31,208 --> 00:05:32,971
53rd Street and 6th Avenue.

122
00:05:33,009 --> 00:05:34,772
- Penthouse suite.
(groans)

123
00:05:34,811 --> 00:05:36,278
- We're being summoned.
(woman's voice echoing)

124
00:05:36,313 --> 00:05:38,577
Stacy: Ask me questions.
Who's the stupidest person on TV?

125
00:05:38,615 --> 00:05:41,209
- Uh, Snooki!
- Oh, yes. You're right.

126
00:05:41,251 --> 00:05:43,048
53rd Street.

127
00:05:43,086 --> 00:05:45,213
(groans)
Who's the smartest?

128
00:05:45,255 --> 00:05:48,884
- Um, House or Frylock?
- Who?

129
00:05:48,925 --> 00:05:51,951
The limping doctor
or the flying French fry.

130
00:05:51,995 --> 00:05:53,360
Woman's voice:
53rd Street.

131
00:05:53,396 --> 00:05:56,263
- Okay, 53rd Street.
(groans)

132
00:05:57,500 --> 00:06:00,128
Don't you love
Times Square?

133
00:06:00,170 --> 00:06:02,001
It feels like the center
of the world.

134
00:06:02,038 --> 00:06:04,131
I feel like a bunch of TVs
threw up.

135
00:06:04,174 --> 00:06:06,233
Woman's voice: Take a cab.
What are you, walking?

136
00:06:06,276 --> 00:06:08,011
Goody: Okay, okay.
We're coming.

137
00:06:08,812 --> 00:06:10,746
What kind of mood
is she in?

138
00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:12,509
- I've seen worse.
- Has she finished feeding?

139
00:06:12,549 --> 00:06:14,073
Because we don't want
to be around any of that.

140
00:06:15,085 --> 00:06:17,417
Where are my offshoots?

141
00:06:17,454 --> 00:06:18,944
There they are.

142
00:06:19,956 --> 00:06:21,423
Look at the new fall line.

143
00:06:21,458 --> 00:06:24,427
Gaultier, Prada.

144
00:06:24,461 --> 00:06:27,055
Dries.

145
00:06:27,097 --> 00:06:29,122
And I can never see how
I look in them.

146
00:06:30,333 --> 00:06:32,460
What is the point
of looking like this

147
00:06:32,502 --> 00:06:34,970
if I can never enjoy it?

148
00:06:35,005 --> 00:06:36,302
Hmm?

149
00:06:36,339 --> 00:06:38,603
- Oh, sucks hard.
- Not so nice.

150
00:06:38,642 --> 00:06:41,543
So put them on and then
I will just imagine

151
00:06:41,578 --> 00:06:44,775
how much better
they will look on me.

152
00:06:46,683 --> 00:06:48,947
Ivan, call Mr. Pizza Guy.

153
00:06:48,985 --> 00:06:50,577
I thought
we were going out.

154
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:52,019
I feel like a pizza guy.

155
00:06:52,055 --> 00:06:54,922
Oh, come on.
Those clothes are wearing you.

156
00:06:54,958 --> 00:06:56,823
Give it some juice.

157
00:06:56,860 --> 00:06:59,522
- I don't know about this one.
- Why not?

158
00:06:59,562 --> 00:07:01,826
It's just not for young people.

159
00:07:02,832 --> 00:07:04,231
Excuse me?

160
00:07:04,267 --> 00:07:07,566
Are you telling me
about being young?

161
00:07:07,604 --> 00:07:09,435
Do you have any idea

162
00:07:09,472 --> 00:07:12,168
how long I have been young?

163
00:07:12,208 --> 00:07:14,073
She just means that,
with the recession and all,

164
00:07:14,110 --> 00:07:16,044
girls of a certain age couldn't
afford something like this.

165
00:07:16,079 --> 00:07:18,980
Plus, it's fur.
It's like wearing a dead animal.

166
00:07:19,015 --> 00:07:20,983
Okay, here's the flaw
in that argument.

167
00:07:21,017 --> 00:07:22,644
Why should the life of a mink

168
00:07:22,686 --> 00:07:25,211
be more valuable than
the life of a pigeon?

169
00:07:25,255 --> 00:07:27,155
You two drink pigeons
every day.

170
00:07:27,190 --> 00:07:29,055
We set them free.

171
00:07:29,092 --> 00:07:31,856
- Stacy got attached.
- To pigeons?

172
00:07:31,895 --> 00:07:33,328
You know what?
We never should've named them.

173
00:07:33,363 --> 00:07:34,796
I know, you're so right.

174
00:07:34,831 --> 00:07:36,594
I mean, how can you hurt
something named Snuggles?

175
00:07:36,633 --> 00:07:38,157
- Or Mr. Doodles?
- Do you remember...

176
00:07:38,201 --> 00:07:40,192
You're pathetic.

177
00:07:40,236 --> 00:07:41,897
(knock on door)

178
00:07:41,938 --> 00:07:43,428
Pizza guy.

179
00:07:45,575 --> 00:07:46,769
Pizza guy.

180
00:07:49,379 --> 00:07:51,813
Who ordered the double cheese
and sausage?

181
00:07:51,848 --> 00:07:53,611
You're late.

182
00:07:53,650 --> 00:07:55,675
They said
20 minutes or less.

183
00:07:55,719 --> 00:07:58,779
You kept me waiting,
you bad boy.

184
00:07:58,822 --> 00:08:00,221
Sorry.

185
00:08:00,256 --> 00:08:03,157
You know what happens
to bad boys.

186
00:08:07,564 --> 00:08:09,429
I hate when she's in town.

187
00:08:09,466 --> 00:08:11,525
- It's disgusting.
- I know.

188
00:08:11,568 --> 00:08:12,967
But let's just have
a good time.

189
00:08:13,003 --> 00:08:14,994
- Come on, we deserve it.
Man: - Taxi!

190
00:08:15,038 --> 00:08:16,528
Besides, it's goth night.

191
00:08:16,573 --> 00:08:19,041
And all the day players
always dress up so cute.

192
00:08:19,075 --> 00:08:23,774
<i>♪ Crash,
the thunderous moan ♪</i>

193
00:08:25,782 --> 00:08:30,583
<i>♪ Thrash and rattle the bones ♪</i>

194
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:32,520
<i>♪ Alone... ♪</i>

195
00:08:32,555 --> 00:08:33,954
We're the oldest ones here.

196
00:08:33,990 --> 00:08:35,685
Except for this schmo hawk.

197
00:08:35,725 --> 00:08:38,216
- Can I buy you ladies a drink?
- We never drink...

198
00:08:38,261 --> 00:08:39,956
(both)
mojitos.

199
00:08:39,996 --> 00:08:41,861
Maybe you should court
someone your own age.

200
00:08:41,898 --> 00:08:44,332
- Oh, did you see that cute one?
- Mm-hmm.

201
00:08:45,335 --> 00:08:46,768
- Hey.
- Hey, Renfield.

202
00:08:46,803 --> 00:08:49,237
Adam Ant called.
He wants his makeup back.

203
00:08:49,272 --> 00:08:52,002
Oh, come on. Awaken me.
I wanna live forever.

204
00:08:52,042 --> 00:08:54,010
Then you should try
eating more broccoli.

205
00:08:54,044 --> 00:08:56,410
No, I don't want to eat more
broccoli. I want to be undead.

206
00:08:56,446 --> 00:08:58,641
You are undead.
You're alive.

207
00:08:58,681 --> 00:09:01,275
Yeah, stop imagining
crazy ideas.

208
00:09:02,485 --> 00:09:04,919
(groans)
No.

209
00:09:04,954 --> 00:09:07,855
What?
- Stuck-up McVainypants is here.

210
00:09:07,891 --> 00:09:11,327
So what?
Just ignore him.

211
00:09:11,361 --> 00:09:12,919
Show him how much fun
you're having.

212
00:09:12,962 --> 00:09:14,361
(phone beeps)

213
00:09:14,397 --> 00:09:15,762
What? No!
No pictures.

214
00:09:15,799 --> 00:09:17,494
Wh... then take me.

215
00:09:17,534 --> 00:09:19,092
Come on.
Let's just go dance.

216
00:09:23,907 --> 00:09:26,307
Isn't this place
a little Mickey Mouse for you?

217
00:09:29,946 --> 00:09:32,847
There is Donor Club
in Chinatown.

218
00:09:32,882 --> 00:09:34,577
I don't know what
you're talking about.

219
00:09:35,885 --> 00:09:38,080
I think I can sense
a real vampire.

220
00:09:38,121 --> 00:09:41,113
Vampire?
That word is so cornball.

221
00:09:41,157 --> 00:09:43,625
And anyone
who says "cornball"

222
00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:45,560
is at least 80 years old.

223
00:09:47,363 --> 00:09:49,228
Okay.
I just don't appreciate

224
00:09:49,265 --> 00:09:50,755
being called the V-word.

225
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:52,131
You prefer ELF?

226
00:09:52,168 --> 00:09:54,830
Extended Life Form, yes.

227
00:09:54,871 --> 00:09:57,237
(chuckles)
So gay.

228
00:09:57,273 --> 00:09:58,968
- Hey.
- Hi, Ivan.

229
00:09:59,008 --> 00:10:01,533
I see you met Vadim.
You know he's my stem.

230
00:10:01,578 --> 00:10:03,637
Oh, you're the Soviet stem.

231
00:10:04,747 --> 00:10:06,237
Ukrainian.

232
00:10:08,184 --> 00:10:09,913
Let's go to that club.
Blood Bank.

233
00:10:09,953 --> 00:10:12,319
We don't feed
off of people.

234
00:10:12,355 --> 00:10:14,118
Oh, great.

235
00:10:14,157 --> 00:10:16,182
As long as Cisserus
takes care of herself.

236
00:10:17,393 --> 00:10:19,884
- Why?
- Anything happens to her,

237
00:10:19,929 --> 00:10:22,523
your years will accrue.

238
00:10:22,565 --> 00:10:24,123
(inhales deeply)
You wouldn't want

239
00:10:24,167 --> 00:10:26,465
to look your age.

240
00:10:26,503 --> 00:10:28,130
Excuse me.

241
00:10:32,675 --> 00:10:34,336
(hisses)

242
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:39,209
I am Vadim.
This is Ivan.

243
00:10:39,249 --> 00:10:41,615
I'll get my coat.

244
00:10:42,852 --> 00:10:45,685
- Oh, Juicy.
- She is asking for it.

245
00:10:45,722 --> 00:10:47,314
Yeah, I'd say.

246
00:10:50,593 --> 00:10:51,992
Listen to me.

247
00:10:52,028 --> 00:10:55,088
Vadim and Ivan
are bad guys.

248
00:10:55,131 --> 00:10:56,598
I like bad guys.

249
00:10:59,836 --> 00:11:02,805
No, you like nice guys.

250
00:11:02,839 --> 00:11:05,831
Don't look at them
and don't talk to them.

251
00:11:05,875 --> 00:11:07,365
Don't talk to them.

252
00:11:07,410 --> 00:11:09,970
And remember,
nice guys.

253
00:11:10,013 --> 00:11:11,913
Nice guys.

254
00:11:17,687 --> 00:11:20,713
Guys that listen
when you say stuff.

255
00:11:20,757 --> 00:11:23,191
Guys that compliment you.

256
00:11:23,226 --> 00:11:25,217
Hey, Juicy.
Where are you going?

257
00:11:25,261 --> 00:11:27,661

- Hey. We're gonna go.
- BRB.

269
00:12:07,804 --> 00:12:10,204
Um, that only works
if you're leaving.

270
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:11,730
"Be right back."

271
00:12:11,774 --> 00:12:15,073
- Oh. SL.
- What?

272
00:12:15,111 --> 00:12:18,239
- "So long"?
- Close enough.

273
00:12:21,484 --> 00:12:23,179
(sniffing)

274
00:12:23,219 --> 00:12:25,483
So I tell my parents I'm coming
to the city for my music.

275
00:12:25,521 --> 00:12:27,648
And they say okay,
as long as I go to NYU.

276
00:12:27,690 --> 00:12:29,317
(sniffs)
You want?

277
00:12:29,359 --> 00:12:31,850
No thanks.
I'm already in the mood.

278
00:12:34,631 --> 00:12:36,292
So now they're all,
"What about law school?"

279
00:12:36,332 --> 00:12:38,197
And I go, "I told you I was
coming here for my music."

280
00:12:38,234 --> 00:12:40,668
So they're, "Then why did we
spend $100,000, Derek?"

281
00:12:40,703 --> 00:12:42,227
I'm like, "You got me.
You could've just gotten me

282
00:12:42,272 --> 00:12:44,001
Pro Tools and I'd be happy.
Law school is your dream,

283
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:45,337
not mine."

284
00:12:45,375 --> 00:12:47,002
And they think it's all
about record deals,

285
00:12:47,043 --> 00:12:48,533
but it's so different now.
They're so old-fashioned.

286
00:12:48,578 --> 00:12:49,943
They just don't get it,
you know?

287
00:12:49,979 --> 00:12:52,106
Hey, my parents
believed in witches.

288
00:12:52,148 --> 00:12:54,412
Hold on, I gotta play
you something.

289
00:12:55,818 --> 00:12:57,547
(music playing)

290
00:12:57,587 --> 00:12:58,918
Mm.

291
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:06,191
(moans)

292
00:13:07,764 --> 00:13:09,789
You've got...
you've got something.

293
00:13:09,832 --> 00:13:12,824
Hmm?
You want a rail?

294
00:13:12,869 --> 00:13:14,564
(whimpers)

295
00:13:20,877 --> 00:13:23,072
A little bit won't hurt.

296
00:13:34,590 --> 00:13:36,785
(sighs)

297
00:13:43,166 --> 00:13:45,760
(groans)
I gotta get out of here.

298
00:13:52,875 --> 00:13:54,775
Hey, people can see you.

299
00:13:54,811 --> 00:13:56,244
What?
Nobody cares.

300
00:13:56,279 --> 00:13:58,770
Besides, the streets are wet
and my shoes are suede.

301
00:13:58,815 --> 00:14:01,477
Stacy, I kinda did
something bad.

302
00:14:01,517 --> 00:14:03,917
- What?
- Well, this drummer guy

303
00:14:03,953 --> 00:14:06,387
was all coked up and his nose
started bleeding.

304
00:14:06,422 --> 00:14:08,890
- Oh, no.
- I just licked a drop.

305
00:14:08,925 --> 00:14:10,790
And what now? Are you jonesing?
Do you have the hunger?

306
00:14:10,827 --> 00:14:12,021
No.

307
00:14:12,061 --> 00:14:14,256
I just had what came out.
It wasn't even flowing.

308
00:14:14,297 --> 00:14:18,165
But I know it would be so much
more satisfying than this whole

309
00:14:18,201 --> 00:14:20,328
get-dressed-go-out-
and-have-sex routine.

310
00:14:20,370 --> 00:14:22,930
I mean, guys used
to want to sing

311
00:14:22,972 --> 00:14:24,667
or paint or write.

312
00:14:24,707 --> 00:14:27,574
Now, it's like iPod hits
and webisodes.

313
00:14:27,610 --> 00:14:29,703
Half the time, I don't even know
what they're talking about.

314
00:14:29,746 --> 00:14:31,805
Well, we're going to group tomorrow.
That always helps.

315
00:14:31,848 --> 00:14:34,112
(men laughing)
- Hey.

316
00:14:34,150 --> 00:14:36,175
Didn't that used to be
a yogurt place?

317
00:14:36,219 --> 00:14:37,777
Things keep changing
around here.

318
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:40,516
Well, in the '70s,
it was a methadone clinic

319
00:14:40,556 --> 00:14:42,854
and all the hippies
would be sitting on the stairs

320
00:14:42,892 --> 00:14:44,757
waiting for their medicine.

321
00:14:44,794 --> 00:14:47,160
And in the '50s,
it was a dance studio,

322
00:14:47,196 --> 00:14:51,394
and everyone came to the Village
to be beatniks.

323
00:14:51,434 --> 00:14:54,164
And before that,
it was a German newspaper.

324
00:14:55,204 --> 00:14:56,694
How do you
know this stuff?

325
00:14:57,707 --> 00:15:00,870
- The History Channel.
- Oh.

326
00:15:00,910 --> 00:15:02,935
(birds chirping)
- Uh-oh, birds.

327
00:15:02,979 --> 00:15:04,378
- Hurry. Go, go!
- Whoops!

328
00:15:04,414 --> 00:15:06,006
- Get back.
- Watch out, Kenny!

329
00:15:06,048 --> 00:15:08,250
Oh!

330
00:15:08,251 --> 00:15:09,548
(siren blaring)

331
00:15:16,325 --> 00:15:18,350
Officer: That's Van Helsing.
Let him through.

332
00:15:20,363 --> 00:15:21,853
Oh, no, no, no.
This doesn't have

333
00:15:21,898 --> 00:15:23,456
anything to do
with Homeland Security

334
00:15:23,499 --> 00:15:25,160
so get away from
my crime scene, huh?

335
00:15:25,201 --> 00:15:26,691
Did you recover the neck?

336
00:15:26,736 --> 00:15:29,569
Look, it's your garden variety
John Doe.

337
00:15:29,605 --> 00:15:31,300
Killed, bled out
someplace else,

338
00:15:31,340 --> 00:15:33,171
they hacked it up
and dumped it here.

339
00:15:33,209 --> 00:15:35,939
You call this bled out?
It's bone dry.

340
00:15:35,978 --> 00:15:37,809
- Detective.
(laughs)

341
00:15:37,847 --> 00:15:40,577
Officer 2: Excuse me, ma'am.
I need you to back up, please.

342
00:15:41,584 --> 00:15:43,176
What is that,
a pizza carrier?

343
00:15:45,021 --> 00:15:47,080
There.
You happy now?

344
00:15:47,123 --> 00:15:49,887
Hey, if we find a subway map
and explosives, we'll call you.

345
00:15:52,829 --> 00:15:54,319
- Whoa.
(woman gasps)

346
00:15:56,599 --> 00:15:58,328
Good evening.
My name is Harry,

347
00:15:58,367 --> 00:16:00,335
and welcome to
Sanguines Anonymous.

348
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:06,406
Tepish, you're a stem,
aren't you?

349
00:16:06,442 --> 00:16:09,138
Someone told me
that if a stem dies,

350
00:16:09,178 --> 00:16:11,043
all the offshoots die.

351
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:13,139
It's an old wives' tale, right?

352
00:16:13,182 --> 00:16:15,173
I thought as long as you stayed
out of the sun, you're okay.

353
00:16:15,218 --> 00:16:17,448
And if your stem died,
you start aging.

354
00:16:17,487 --> 00:16:21,446
No, you start aging,
but not like the day players.

355
00:16:21,491 --> 00:16:24,722
You become
your chronological age.

356
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:26,318
When were you awakened?

357
00:16:26,362 --> 00:16:28,057
1841.

358
00:16:28,097 --> 00:16:30,531
Ah, pfft.
Baby.

359
00:16:30,566 --> 00:16:33,626
Besides,
200 is the new 80.

360
00:16:33,669 --> 00:16:36,035
Stacy turned in 1992.

361
00:16:36,072 --> 00:16:38,540
Does she know
how old you are?

362
00:16:38,574 --> 00:16:39,939
No.

363
00:16:39,976 --> 00:16:43,070
It seemed to comfort her
thinking we were the same age.

364
00:16:43,112 --> 00:16:44,340
Ah, I see.

365
00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:47,611
- You're from Cisserus, huh?
- You know her?

366
00:16:49,085 --> 00:16:50,575
We had a fling.

367
00:16:50,620 --> 00:16:52,053
Mm.

368
00:16:52,088 --> 00:16:54,522
That took about
a century off my life.

369
00:16:54,557 --> 00:16:56,320
Hey.

370
00:16:57,727 --> 00:17:01,128
Tepish, would you like
to start off tonight?

371
00:17:01,163 --> 00:17:02,892
Okay.

372
00:17:05,368 --> 00:17:07,632
Thank you, Harry.

373
00:17:07,670 --> 00:17:09,160
Hi, everyone.

374
00:17:09,205 --> 00:17:11,173
I am Vlad Tepish.

375
00:17:11,207 --> 00:17:12,435
You know,
Vlad the Impaler.

376
00:17:12,475 --> 00:17:13,999
All:
Hi, Vlad Tepish.

377
00:17:14,043 --> 00:17:17,979
I have abstained
from the fluids of homo sapiens

378
00:17:18,014 --> 00:17:21,916
for 362 years.

379
00:17:21,951 --> 00:17:23,851
(cheering, clapping)

380
00:17:25,555 --> 00:17:27,352
I'm sure that you've heard
about what I did

381
00:17:27,390 --> 00:17:28,880
to the Turkish army, huh?

382
00:17:28,925 --> 00:17:30,290
Woman:
He impaled them.

383
00:17:30,326 --> 00:17:33,295
You youngsters have to learn
how to substitute

384
00:17:33,329 --> 00:17:37,390
what you can't do with things
that are less harmful.

385
00:17:37,433 --> 00:17:40,698
Personally,
I like knitting.

386
00:17:40,736 --> 00:17:42,328
Especially...

387
00:17:44,140 --> 00:17:46,665
- this part.
(crowd laughing)

388
00:17:46,709 --> 00:17:48,438
Thank you, thank you.
Thank you.

389
00:17:52,848 --> 00:17:56,648
- Hi, I'm Stacy.
- Hi, Stacy.

390
00:17:56,686 --> 00:17:59,484
I've been in my 20s
for two decades,

391
00:17:59,522 --> 00:18:03,117
and when I was a day player,
I was doing a lot of E.

392
00:18:03,159 --> 00:18:05,150
Man: E?
I don't know what that is.

393
00:18:05,194 --> 00:18:07,355
That's ecstasy.

394
00:18:07,396 --> 00:18:10,832
And then one night,
I must've been pretty stoned,

395
00:18:10,866 --> 00:18:12,197
'cause I don't even remember,

396
00:18:12,234 --> 00:18:15,169
but I know Cisserus
was feeding on me,

397
00:18:15,204 --> 00:18:17,331
and Goody was arguing
that I would be a good

398
00:18:17,373 --> 00:18:19,102
clothing model for her.

399
00:18:19,141 --> 00:18:21,905
So if it wasn't for Goody,
I would be dead.

400
00:18:21,944 --> 00:18:24,037
Like, dead-dead.

401
00:18:25,414 --> 00:18:28,713
But she says that I saved her
because she'd been so lonely,

402
00:18:28,751 --> 00:18:31,447
and having a friend made
her want to keep existing.

403
00:18:31,487 --> 00:18:34,479
Even though I've never
had human blood,

404
00:18:34,523 --> 00:18:36,423
I still feel tempted.

405
00:18:36,459 --> 00:18:38,893
But it's like drugs.

406
00:18:38,928 --> 00:18:41,419
We don't need
the high-highs.

407
00:18:41,464 --> 00:18:44,024
It's more satisfying
to not hurt anybody

408
00:18:44,066 --> 00:18:45,658
and just have fun
with your friends.

409
00:18:45,701 --> 00:18:47,362
(clapping)

410
00:18:48,838 --> 00:18:51,033
- Thanks.
Harry: - Good meeting, people.

411
00:18:51,073 --> 00:18:53,234
Shall we?

412
00:18:53,275 --> 00:18:56,301
All: When it comes to
drinking human blood,

413
00:18:56,345 --> 00:18:59,212
a single drop is too much,

414
00:18:59,248 --> 00:19:02,183
and a whole family
is never enough.

415
00:19:02,218 --> 00:19:04,413
Support your fellow ELFs.

416
00:19:04,453 --> 00:19:08,082
Undead is not unfeeling.

417
00:19:08,124 --> 00:19:09,853
Great.

418
00:19:28,044 --> 00:19:29,739
What are you doing?

419
00:19:29,779 --> 00:19:31,371
Don't you hate it when
you sprout fangs,

420
00:19:31,414 --> 00:19:33,541
part's white and then
the other part's dingy?

421
00:19:33,582 --> 00:19:35,447
I never thought about it.

422
00:19:35,484 --> 00:19:37,952
(phone rings)
- It's Renfield.

423
00:19:37,987 --> 00:19:40,353
Both: - Hey, Renfield!
- Where are you guys?

424
00:19:40,389 --> 00:19:41,686
Let's go to SoHo House.

425
00:19:41,724 --> 00:19:43,555
I'm sick of these clip joints.

426
00:19:43,592 --> 00:19:46,789
How about this?
You go, and if it's great, text us.

427
00:19:46,829 --> 00:19:48,023
All right. G2G

428
00:19:48,064 --> 00:19:49,895
Both:
G2G.

429
00:19:49,932 --> 00:19:51,422
"Got to go."

430
00:19:51,467 --> 00:19:54,698
(sighs)
Why can't kids say entire words?

431
00:19:54,737 --> 00:19:56,637
It takes just as long
to say letters.

432
00:19:56,672 --> 00:19:59,004
Remember, we said
that we'd keep up with the times

433
00:19:59,041 --> 00:20:00,770
even though it's not as good
as the '80s.

434
00:20:00,810 --> 00:20:02,402
You don't hear me
complaining every time

435
00:20:02,445 --> 00:20:04,345
a new song comes on
that Devo is much better.

436
00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:06,245
That's true.

437
00:20:06,282 --> 00:20:07,943
You have a glob.

438
00:20:07,983 --> 00:20:10,451
- Here?
- Other side.

439
00:20:10,486 --> 00:20:13,455
- Here?
- A little higher.

440
00:20:13,489 --> 00:20:16,083
(groans)
Doesn't it drive you crazy

441
00:20:16,125 --> 00:20:17,558
not knowing
what you look like?

442
00:20:17,593 --> 00:20:19,151
You look the same
as you always did.

443
00:20:19,195 --> 00:20:21,561
- You have pictures from before.
- No.

444
00:20:21,597 --> 00:20:23,224
You don't have any pictures
from your early years?

445
00:20:23,265 --> 00:20:25,130
No.

446
00:20:25,167 --> 00:20:26,964
A guy in the park drew this.

447
00:20:27,002 --> 00:20:28,697
Do I look anything like this?

448
00:20:28,738 --> 00:20:30,638
(laughs)
Oh, yeah.

449
00:20:30,673 --> 00:20:32,436
- He really captured you.
- Oh.

450
00:20:32,475 --> 00:20:34,375
Hold on.

451
00:20:38,981 --> 00:20:42,542
Okay, she sort of has
your structure.

452
00:20:42,585 --> 00:20:44,576
You have rounder eyes,

453
00:20:44,620 --> 00:20:46,417
shorter chin,

454
00:20:46,455 --> 00:20:49,117
change the hair,

455
00:20:49,158 --> 00:20:50,489
green eyes,

456
00:20:50,526 --> 00:20:52,289
and...

457
00:20:52,328 --> 00:20:54,421
fix the nose.

458
00:20:54,463 --> 00:20:56,260
- And print.
(printer whirrs)

459
00:21:00,503 --> 00:21:02,266
Oh, my God.

460
00:21:04,106 --> 00:21:06,700
- That's me.
- Yeah.

461
00:21:06,742 --> 00:21:08,801
It's been so long.

462
00:21:08,844 --> 00:21:13,042
I take back everything bad
I ever said about computers.

463
00:21:13,082 --> 00:21:14,549
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

464
00:21:14,583 --> 00:21:15,811
(birds chirping)
- Ooh.

465
00:21:22,424 --> 00:21:25,293
- Good morning.
- Morning.

466
00:21:25,294 --> 00:21:28,229
(phones beeping)
(music playing)

467
00:21:35,538 --> 00:21:37,870
(gasps)
Ew.

468
00:21:37,907 --> 00:21:40,068
Well, LASIK has come
a long way.

469
00:21:43,379 --> 00:21:46,075
- Hi, I'm Joey.
- Hi, I'm Stacy.

470
00:22:20,115 --> 00:22:22,106
Hey, would you like to have
lunch with me sometime?

471
00:22:22,151 --> 00:22:23,618
- No.
- Okay.

472
00:22:24,787 --> 00:22:27,347
Um, no, what I meant was
I work during the day

473
00:22:27,389 --> 00:22:31,223
but I could have coffee
or drinks.

474
00:22:31,260 --> 00:22:33,228
Okay, great.

475
00:22:37,433 --> 00:22:40,095
All right,
any questions?

476
00:22:40,135 --> 00:22:41,625
Yes, Professor Quincy.

477
00:22:41,670 --> 00:22:43,934
How many surrealists does
it take to change a light bulb?

478
00:22:43,973 --> 00:22:46,464
- How many?
- A bicycle.

479
00:22:46,508 --> 00:22:47,907
(students groan)

480
00:22:47,943 --> 00:22:50,207
Well, thank you for that wonderful
insight, Mr. Van Helsing.

481
00:22:52,514 --> 00:22:55,483
Quincy: All right, I know
that was no "Talladega Nights."

482
00:22:55,517 --> 00:22:57,747
Now what was Dalí
trying to do in this?

483
00:22:59,722 --> 00:23:03,089
Stacy, don't take a nap.

484
00:23:03,125 --> 00:23:04,615
You'll be up all day.

485
00:23:04,660 --> 00:23:07,720
I'm so tired.
I was IM'ing all day.

486
00:23:10,366 --> 00:23:12,357
I barely slept.

487
00:23:12,401 --> 00:23:14,028
I met someone
at school.

488
00:23:14,069 --> 00:23:16,401
- What's his story?
- He's silly.

489
00:23:16,438 --> 00:23:18,338
Goofy but cute.

490
00:23:18,374 --> 00:23:20,808
- What's his name?
- His name?

491
00:23:20,843 --> 00:23:22,777
Um, his name is Joey...

492
00:23:22,811 --> 00:23:24,210
Van Helsing.

493
00:23:24,246 --> 00:23:25,611
What?

494
00:23:25,648 --> 00:23:28,811
I'm sure it's a coincidence.
It's a common name.

495
00:23:28,851 --> 00:23:31,786
And you didn't hit it off
with Timmy Hitler?

496
00:23:31,820 --> 00:23:33,287
Very funny.

497
00:23:33,322 --> 00:23:34,755
I don't like it.

498
00:23:35,758 --> 00:23:37,953
I can take care
of myself.

499
00:23:41,563 --> 00:23:43,394
Guess what Joey
wants to do this weekend?

500
00:23:43,432 --> 00:23:46,265
- Behead you?
- Ha-ha.

501
00:23:48,170 --> 00:23:49,694
Man: I need to see
my wife's chart.

502
00:23:49,738 --> 00:23:52,298
You know, I've asked about
four times in the past hour.

503
00:23:52,341 --> 00:23:55,208
So get me
the goddamn chart.

504
00:23:55,244 --> 00:23:58,771
And don't start
with the shifts.

505
00:23:58,814 --> 00:24:01,510
And you won't be sued
for malpractice

506
00:24:01,550 --> 00:24:02,915
if you do it now.

507
00:24:02,952 --> 00:24:05,079
Hell no, we won't go.

508
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:07,145
Hell no,
we won't go.

509
00:24:07,189 --> 00:24:08,679
Hell no...

510
00:24:08,724 --> 00:24:11,192
Man: Enough already.
I've had enough.

511
00:24:28,177 --> 00:24:30,611
Man: Hi, honey.
Hi, honey.

512
00:24:30,646 --> 00:24:31,806
Love you.

513
00:24:31,847 --> 00:24:34,839
I told them not to bring
you any... look at this.

514
00:24:34,883 --> 00:24:37,317
I don't want you to eat this.
Look at this.

515
00:24:37,353 --> 00:24:39,719
They use this for breast
implants in the other wing.

516
00:24:39,755 --> 00:24:41,484
Guess where I went?
Cappuccino.

517
00:24:41,523 --> 00:24:44,321
- Oh...
- Look at this.

518
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:46,920
How much?
How much do we love cannoli?

519
00:24:50,466 --> 00:24:52,297
All right, maybe later.

520
00:24:54,303 --> 00:24:55,998
How you doing in there?

521
00:24:56,038 --> 00:24:58,700
(lid creaks open)
- Ugh.

522
00:24:58,741 --> 00:25:02,370
- I'm tired.
- Oh, shit.

523
00:25:03,846 --> 00:25:06,076
- You got jury duty.
- What?

524
00:25:06,115 --> 00:25:09,414
- 8:00 a.m.
- No.

525
00:25:09,451 --> 00:25:11,112
How could this happen?

526
00:25:11,153 --> 00:25:13,280
We're paid in cash.
We don't do taxes.

527
00:25:13,322 --> 00:25:14,721
I don't even have
a driver's license.

528
00:25:14,757 --> 00:25:16,281
Our credit cards
are through a third party.

529
00:25:16,325 --> 00:25:18,520
(gasps)
Oh. I voted once.

530
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:20,892
- You what?
- I voted for Dukakis.

531
00:25:20,929 --> 00:25:24,023
- Dukakis?
- It was before I turned.

532
00:25:24,066 --> 00:25:25,863
And I was just thinking
about the good of the country.

533
00:25:25,901 --> 00:25:28,267
Goody: Country?
It's just business.

534
00:25:28,303 --> 00:25:30,498
From the Dutch West
India Company

535
00:25:30,539 --> 00:25:32,006
to the slave trade.

536
00:25:32,041 --> 00:25:33,531
How do you know
all this stuff?

537
00:25:34,710 --> 00:25:36,974
Um, The History Channel.

538
00:25:37,012 --> 00:25:38,707
(phone chimes)

539
00:25:38,747 --> 00:25:40,840
Yay!

540
00:25:40,883 --> 00:25:43,716
If you're here and he's there,
why don't you talk?

541
00:25:43,752 --> 00:25:45,310
Nobody talks.

542
00:25:45,354 --> 00:25:46,878
Do you want him
to think I'm 40?

543
00:25:50,692 --> 00:25:52,785
So, if the city has
too much garbage,

544
00:25:52,828 --> 00:25:54,261
and rats eat garbage,

545
00:25:54,296 --> 00:25:56,230
why don't we just get rats
to eat the garbage

546
00:25:56,265 --> 00:25:58,130
instead of spraying
toxic crap everywhere?

547
00:25:58,167 --> 00:25:59,828
- Rats breed too quickly.
- So?

548
00:25:59,868 --> 00:26:01,062
What if we give them
birth control?

549
00:26:01,103 --> 00:26:02,832
You mean get rats
to put on condoms?

550
00:26:02,871 --> 00:26:05,237
Yeah.
Teensy-weensy little condoms.

551
00:26:05,274 --> 00:26:07,799
Who's that old hippie
talking to Fred?

552
00:26:07,843 --> 00:26:09,743
You must mean the girls from
the graveyard shift.

553
00:26:09,778 --> 00:26:11,769
Shit.
I used to go out with him

554
00:26:11,814 --> 00:26:13,042
before you and I
knew each other.

555
00:26:13,082 --> 00:26:15,243
Oh, my God. He's gonna
expect you to be like 40.

556
00:26:15,284 --> 00:26:17,775
- I know.
- Hi.

557
00:26:17,820 --> 00:26:20,050
Wow.

558
00:26:20,089 --> 00:26:21,681
How is it possible?

559
00:26:21,723 --> 00:26:23,520
How is what possible?

560
00:26:25,761 --> 00:26:27,922
Goody, you have not
aged a day.

561
00:26:27,963 --> 00:26:29,760
Mister, my name is Susan.

562
00:26:29,798 --> 00:26:32,631
But my mother's name was Goody.
Did you know her?

563
00:26:32,668 --> 00:26:35,967
Goody Rutherford?
Is that your mother?

564
00:26:36,004 --> 00:26:38,234
Yes, but she passed away.

565
00:26:38,273 --> 00:26:41,367
Oh.
I-l-I'm sorry.

566
00:26:41,410 --> 00:26:44,345
My name is Danny Horowitz.

567
00:26:44,379 --> 00:26:46,973
Did she ever, uh, you know,
like, mention me?

568
00:26:48,684 --> 00:26:50,743
I think.

569
00:26:50,786 --> 00:26:52,276
- But we have to get to work.
- Hey.

570
00:26:52,321 --> 00:26:55,779
Hi, I under... listen.
I have to talk to you.

571
00:26:55,824 --> 00:26:58,019
Please call me tomorrow.

572
00:26:58,060 --> 00:26:59,618
Okay.
Tomorrow night.

573
00:26:59,661 --> 00:27:02,289
(chuckles)
Night, of course.

574
00:27:02,331 --> 00:27:04,196
Just like your mother.

575
00:27:04,233 --> 00:27:06,428
Okay.

576
00:27:12,774 --> 00:27:15,641
- So, is this your place?
- It's my parents' place.

577
00:27:15,677 --> 00:27:18,168
When my ex and I broke up,
I was traveling

578
00:27:18,213 --> 00:27:21,114
and I haven't found
a new place yet.

579
00:27:21,150 --> 00:27:23,675
Computer: - Iris recognition.
- So, what does your dad do?

580
00:27:23,719 --> 00:27:25,550
Well, he works for
Homeland Security now,

581
00:27:25,587 --> 00:27:28,681
but he was with MI-6 in London
for quite a long time.

582
00:27:28,724 --> 00:27:31,454
So is he, um,
some kind of spy?

583
00:27:31,493 --> 00:27:34,758
Yeah, like James Bond
but shorter.

584
00:27:35,797 --> 00:27:37,856
Listen, Stacy.
There's something I have to tell you.

585
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:41,097
- What?
- I'm older than you think.

586
00:27:41,136 --> 00:27:43,969
I've been helping my dad with
this project for a few years,

587
00:27:44,006 --> 00:27:47,464
and since I'm still in school,
you probably think I'm, like, 20.

588
00:27:47,509 --> 00:27:49,534
But I'm almost 25.

589
00:27:49,578 --> 00:27:53,173
- And since you're like 17...
(laughs)

590
00:27:53,215 --> 00:27:56,150
Um, actually
I'm a little bit older

591
00:27:56,185 --> 00:27:57,948
than the other kids, too.

592
00:27:57,986 --> 00:27:59,783
You are?

593
00:28:00,856 --> 00:28:02,380
Well, great.
Well, how old are you?

594
00:28:02,424 --> 00:28:04,722
You don't ask
a lady her age.

595
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:07,251
- Well, why not?
- Because it's very impolite.

596
00:28:07,296 --> 00:28:09,025
- How am I gonna find out?
- I don't know.

597
00:28:09,064 --> 00:28:11,089
I'm gonna nick
your passport.

598
00:28:11,133 --> 00:28:13,693
Woman: I'm never going again.
The performance was ghastly.

599
00:28:13,735 --> 00:28:16,602
No, the clown was so...

600
00:28:16,638 --> 00:28:18,799
- Joey.
- Oh.

601
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:20,307
I didn't know
you had company.

602
00:28:20,342 --> 00:28:22,139
We just got back.
This is Stacy.

603
00:28:22,177 --> 00:28:24,008
Stacy, my mother and father.

604
00:28:24,046 --> 00:28:25,445
- Hi, Stacy.
- Oh, pleasure.

605
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:26,811
- Nice to meet you.
- Uh, yeah.

606
00:28:26,848 --> 00:28:28,782
- How do you do?
- Hi.

607
00:28:28,817 --> 00:28:30,307
Well, I actually
have to get to my job.

608
00:28:30,352 --> 00:28:33,617
- You work at night?
- Yeah, it's so depressing.

609
00:28:33,655 --> 00:28:37,022
But, you know,
just until school gets out.

610
00:28:37,059 --> 00:28:38,856
- I have to go.
- I'll see you out.

611
00:28:41,063 --> 00:28:42,496
- Ta!
- Yeah.

612
00:28:42,531 --> 00:28:43,930
(door closes)

613
00:28:43,966 --> 00:28:46,764
- Did you feel her hands?
- Freezing.

614
00:28:46,802 --> 00:28:49,896
(people chanting)

615
00:28:49,938 --> 00:28:51,530
I'm glad you're interested.
Are you a registered voter?

616
00:28:51,573 --> 00:28:53,268
No matter what's going
on in the world,

617
00:28:53,308 --> 00:28:55,833
there's always someone
protesting or petitioning,

618
00:28:55,877 --> 00:28:58,175
and they always wind up
in Union Square.

619
00:29:00,015 --> 00:29:03,542
Even in the 1840s, people were
pamphleteering for abolition.

620
00:29:03,585 --> 00:29:05,576
...southern flesh peddlers!

621
00:29:05,621 --> 00:29:07,885
Slavery will tear
our country apart!

622
00:29:07,923 --> 00:29:09,948
Sir, may I proffer
you a pamphlet?

623
00:29:09,992 --> 00:29:12,085
Abolition now!

624
00:29:12,127 --> 00:29:14,994
Sir... sir, may I proffer
you a pamphlet?

625
00:29:17,199 --> 00:29:18,757
And in the 1950s,

626
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:21,530
thousands of people
protested to stop

627
00:29:21,570 --> 00:29:23,470
the execution
of the Rosenbergs.

628
00:29:25,274 --> 00:29:28,368
Of course, in the '60s, there was
always a Vietnam demonstration.

629
00:29:28,410 --> 00:29:29,707
Hell no, we won't go!

630
00:29:29,745 --> 00:29:32,111
Hell no, we won't go!

631
00:29:32,147 --> 00:29:35,207
Hell no, we won't go!
Hell no...

632
00:29:35,250 --> 00:29:38,686
Must've been pretty crazy to see
your old boyfriend like that, huh?

633
00:29:39,688 --> 00:29:41,246
How long were
you guys together?

634
00:29:41,290 --> 00:29:43,258
Over a year.
We never lived together,

635
00:29:43,292 --> 00:29:45,522
but we saw each other
every night.

636
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:49,428
I forgot how nice it felt seeing
someone you love all the time.

637
00:29:50,766 --> 00:29:53,257
I wonder what Joey's parents
think about me.

638
00:29:53,302 --> 00:29:54,860
So what did you think
of Stacy?

639
00:29:54,903 --> 00:29:56,700
(clears throat)
She's rather pale.

640
00:29:56,738 --> 00:29:58,035
How do you mean?

641
00:29:58,073 --> 00:30:00,098
What your mother means
is she's...

642
00:30:01,109 --> 00:30:03,669
exceedingly white.

643
00:30:03,712 --> 00:30:05,373
So you don't like her because
of the color of her skin?

644
00:30:05,414 --> 00:30:06,745
Is that what
you're telling me?

645
00:30:06,782 --> 00:30:08,272
Oh, don't be so dramatic.

646
00:30:08,317 --> 00:30:10,217
No, it's simply that
she's not like us.

647
00:30:10,252 --> 00:30:12,083
You mean wealthy,
over-educated,

648
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:14,315
Upper-West-Side,
paranoid, ghoul-chasing...

649
00:30:14,356 --> 00:30:16,586
Oh, for fuck's sake.
She's undead!

650
00:30:16,625 --> 00:30:19,594
(sighs)
- And I forbid you to see her!

651
00:30:19,628 --> 00:30:21,118
You think everyone
is a vampire.

652
00:30:21,163 --> 00:30:22,687
Just because somebody stays up late,
doesn't go to bed before 3:00...

653
00:30:22,731 --> 00:30:24,096
Well excuse me for being
overly vigilant.

654
00:30:24,132 --> 00:30:25,599
...doesn't mean
they can just grow fangs,

655
00:30:25,634 --> 00:30:27,465
- put on a black cape...
- But I think beings

656
00:30:27,502 --> 00:30:29,663
- devoid of warm blood...
- ...and fly around town like a bat!

657
00:30:29,705 --> 00:30:31,104
Just because
they're a little peaky,

658
00:30:31,139 --> 00:30:32,504
it doesn't mean
they drink blood.

659
00:30:32,541 --> 00:30:34,668
...roam the street at night
looking for innocent victims.

660
00:30:34,710 --> 00:30:36,177
You are so intolerant.

661
00:30:36,211 --> 00:30:39,647
Enough!
Stop it, both of you.

662
00:30:39,681 --> 00:30:42,309
Let's just invite
your little friend to supper.

663
00:30:42,351 --> 00:30:44,512
If she's one of them,
we'll know.

664
00:30:44,553 --> 00:30:46,180
Fine.

665
00:30:48,056 --> 00:30:51,321
Tonight, we're meeting
under sad circumstances.

666
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:53,885
I'm sure by now you've
all heard about David's

667
00:30:53,929 --> 00:30:56,124
tragic Daylight Savings accident.

668
00:30:56,164 --> 00:30:57,631
(group murmurs)

669
00:30:57,666 --> 00:30:59,600
Harry:
Boy, one century you're here

670
00:30:59,634 --> 00:31:01,226
and the next you're gone.

671
00:31:02,571 --> 00:31:04,232
Do you sense
something gross?

672
00:31:06,408 --> 00:31:08,035
Yes.

673
00:31:08,076 --> 00:31:09,441
Harry:
I see we have a newcomer.

674
00:31:09,478 --> 00:31:11,503
Uh, yeah, hi.
I'm Rita.

675
00:31:11,546 --> 00:31:12,979
All:
Hi, Rita.

676
00:31:13,014 --> 00:31:15,073
I am a psy-vampire.

677
00:31:15,117 --> 00:31:17,415
(faint laughing)

678
00:31:17,452 --> 00:31:20,250
- What exactly is that?
- Psychic vampire.

679
00:31:20,288 --> 00:31:23,746
I'm able to feed off
other people's auras.

680
00:31:23,792 --> 00:31:25,987
You know,
I absorb their energy.

681
00:31:26,027 --> 00:31:28,325
How do you know you're
not just annoying them?

682
00:31:28,363 --> 00:31:29,523
(laughing)

683
00:31:29,564 --> 00:31:32,829
Psy-vampires are
a true vampiric subset, okay?

684
00:31:32,868 --> 00:31:35,098
And we don't need blood
to draw...

685
00:31:35,137 --> 00:31:36,729
(growls)

686
00:31:36,772 --> 00:31:38,433
(screaming)

687
00:31:38,473 --> 00:31:40,441
What the fuck is that?

688
00:31:40,475 --> 00:31:42,500
(laughing)

689
00:31:42,544 --> 00:31:44,739
All right, all right.
Settle down.

690
00:31:44,780 --> 00:31:46,509
Harry: We really
gotta be more careful

691
00:31:46,548 --> 00:31:48,345
about how we announce
our meetings.

692
00:31:48,383 --> 00:31:50,681
Anybody else
have something to share?

693
00:31:50,719 --> 00:31:52,778
Stacy got called in
for jury duty,

694
00:31:52,821 --> 00:31:54,812
but she hasn't voted
since the '80s.

695
00:31:54,856 --> 00:31:56,084
That happened to me.

696
00:31:56,124 --> 00:31:58,024
And they're bringing me in
for an audit.

697
00:31:58,059 --> 00:31:59,686
Everybody call
on your stems

698
00:31:59,728 --> 00:32:01,593
and any human-feeders
you know.

699
00:32:01,630 --> 00:32:03,154
But how are we
gonna find Cisserus?

700
00:32:03,198 --> 00:32:04,529
You don't know
her resting place?

701
00:32:04,566 --> 00:32:06,557
When she wants us,
she summons us.

702
00:32:06,601 --> 00:32:08,330
We never call on her.

703
00:32:08,370 --> 00:32:09,701
Okay.

704
00:32:09,738 --> 00:32:11,330
We all gotta work together, folks.

705
00:32:11,373 --> 00:32:13,967
The community
is being persecuted.

706
00:32:14,009 --> 00:32:16,136
I've seen it all before.

707
00:32:16,178 --> 00:32:19,944
Now instead of tortures,
they're using computers.

708
00:32:22,350 --> 00:32:24,545
Does Mr. Davidoff
know you are coming?

709
00:32:24,586 --> 00:32:27,111
Mr. Davidoff is aware

710
00:32:27,155 --> 00:32:29,646
we'll be here between
7:00 a.m. and 12:00 p.m.

711
00:32:30,659 --> 00:32:33,059
But don't you need
a search warrant?

712
00:32:33,094 --> 00:32:36,928
Madam, you've insultingly
confused us with the police.

713
00:32:36,965 --> 00:32:38,432
I'm from Time Warner,

714
00:32:38,467 --> 00:32:40,731
and if you ever want to see
Jon Stewart again,

715
00:32:40,769 --> 00:32:42,293
you'll open this door.

716
00:32:44,739 --> 00:32:46,400
Let's get some light in here.

717
00:32:51,613 --> 00:32:53,012
Van Helsing:
Morning, Sunshine.

718
00:32:53,048 --> 00:32:55,141
(growling)

719
00:32:55,183 --> 00:32:57,310
(grunts)
(screams)

720
00:32:57,352 --> 00:32:59,684
(growling)

721
00:33:11,566 --> 00:33:14,364
(singing in Spanish)

722
00:33:17,739 --> 00:33:19,764
Buenas noches, chicas.

723
00:33:19,808 --> 00:33:21,298
Have you seen Ivan?

724
00:33:21,343 --> 00:33:23,311
He hasn't answered
any of my summonses.

725
00:33:23,345 --> 00:33:25,336
Uh, I think we saw him
last week.

726
00:33:25,380 --> 00:33:26,847
Something must have happened.

727
00:33:26,882 --> 00:33:28,474
He's not strong enough
to ignore you.

728
00:33:28,517 --> 00:33:31,714
Well, you chicas
will just have to fill in.

729
00:33:31,753 --> 00:33:34,586
But we're only good at modeling
and light clerical work.

730
00:33:34,623 --> 00:33:38,081
So, you fold these carefully,

731
00:33:38,126 --> 00:33:40,356
and you pack this soil.

732
00:33:40,395 --> 00:33:43,728
Don't you just love
these "As-seen-on-TV" bags?

733
00:33:45,033 --> 00:33:47,297
(air hissing)

734
00:33:49,804 --> 00:33:51,328
Look how much soil
it can fit.

735
00:33:52,340 --> 00:33:54,001
Oh, it's a good thing we're here
because there's gonna be

736
00:33:54,042 --> 00:33:56,772
a big meeting with all
the local stems and ELFs.

737
00:33:56,811 --> 00:33:59,041
Stacy: There's been a lot of
persecution of the community.

738
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:01,310
- What do I care?
- Well, if you keep acting

739
00:34:01,349 --> 00:34:03,044
so recklessly,
they're gonna find you.

740
00:34:03,084 --> 00:34:06,315
No one will ever
find my lair.

741
00:34:06,354 --> 00:34:09,983
And I'm in the one place
no New Yorker ever goes.

742
00:34:10,025 --> 00:34:12,152
But your behavior makes
it harder for everyone else.

743
00:34:12,193 --> 00:34:13,717
For who?

744
00:34:13,762 --> 00:34:16,128
For Vlad Tepish
and his doofus peasants?

745
00:34:16,164 --> 00:34:17,825
"Vlad the Impaler"?

746
00:34:17,866 --> 00:34:20,357
I'll tell you what that whole
impaling routine was.

747
00:34:20,402 --> 00:34:22,233
Compensation.

748
00:34:22,270 --> 00:34:23,999
You know what I'm saying?

749
00:34:24,039 --> 00:34:27,304
Besides, I am leaving town.

750
00:34:29,177 --> 00:34:31,543
And look at this pimpin'
travel coffin he made me.

751
00:34:33,214 --> 00:34:35,114
Here's the itinerary.

752
00:34:35,150 --> 00:34:37,482
Just get me on cargo
before dawn.

753
00:34:37,519 --> 00:34:38,918
It's a private jet.

754
00:34:38,954 --> 00:34:40,854
Spain?
What's in Spain?

755
00:34:40,889 --> 00:34:42,914
It is not just the rain
in Spain.

756
00:34:42,958 --> 00:34:44,789
Look at him.

757
00:34:44,826 --> 00:34:46,691
Diego Bardem.

758
00:34:46,728 --> 00:34:49,526
Only the handsomest,
most talented man in the world.

759
00:34:49,564 --> 00:34:52,533
- Do you know him?
- No, I don't know him.

760
00:34:52,567 --> 00:34:54,467
But I got mad love for him.

761
00:34:54,502 --> 00:34:55,935
And I'll tell you a secret.

762
00:34:57,772 --> 00:35:01,367
I am not gonna use
any hypnotism.

763
00:35:02,844 --> 00:35:04,869
I want this to be real.

764
00:35:06,915 --> 00:35:10,612
I haven't felt this way about
anyone since Al Jolson.

765
00:35:10,652 --> 00:35:12,176
The Mammy guy?

766
00:35:13,188 --> 00:35:14,985
Yes, the Mammy guy.

767
00:35:15,023 --> 00:35:17,821
I mean, he was an amazingly
dynamic performer.

768
00:35:17,859 --> 00:35:20,953
You have no idea because
you never saw him live.

769
00:35:23,264 --> 00:35:24,788
No, no, no.

770
00:35:24,833 --> 00:35:26,164
(trilling)

771
00:35:26,201 --> 00:35:27,828
Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay.

772
00:35:33,308 --> 00:35:33,375
(phone rings)
- Hey.

773
00:35:33,376 --> 00:35:35,639
(phone rings)
- Hey.

774
00:35:36,645 --> 00:35:38,613
What did your parents
say about me?

775
00:35:38,647 --> 00:35:41,013
- Are you near your computer?
- Yeah.

776
00:35:41,049 --> 00:35:42,346
Come on iChat.
I wanna see you.

777
00:35:43,351 --> 00:35:44,716
(screams)
- Oh!

778
00:35:44,753 --> 00:35:47,688
I don't... I don't have iChat.

779
00:35:47,722 --> 00:35:49,451
Yeah, you do.
It's built in.

780
00:35:49,491 --> 00:35:51,891
Yeah, but my roommate
was spray painting

781
00:35:51,926 --> 00:35:53,791
and she got paint
on the lens.

782
00:35:53,828 --> 00:35:55,295
- So...
- Pfft.

783
00:35:55,330 --> 00:35:56,820
What did
your parents say?

784
00:35:56,865 --> 00:35:59,561
They thought
you were a bit pale.

785
00:36:01,236 --> 00:36:02,965
What do you mean pale?

786
00:36:03,004 --> 00:36:04,801
Well, you know, pale,
fair skin.

787
00:36:04,839 --> 00:36:07,000
Like maybe you were sick
or something.

788
00:36:07,042 --> 00:36:09,636
Well, it's just those
environmental light bulbs.

789
00:36:09,678 --> 00:36:11,168
I mean, they make everybody
look horrible.

790
00:36:11,212 --> 00:36:13,009
Look, they want you to come
for dinner on Friday.

791
00:36:13,048 --> 00:36:14,538
Can you make it?

792
00:36:14,582 --> 00:36:16,243
Oh, I'll be there.

793
00:36:21,423 --> 00:36:25,723

- It's good, right?
- I think it's totally working.

809
00:37:24,319 --> 00:37:25,809
I'm gonna be so tan.

810
00:37:25,854 --> 00:37:27,287
(doorbell chimes)

811
00:37:29,557 --> 00:37:31,047
Hi.

812
00:37:32,060 --> 00:37:33,550
Wow.
You look...

813
00:37:33,595 --> 00:37:35,062
Robust?

814
00:37:35,096 --> 00:37:37,564
Sure.

815
00:37:37,599 --> 00:37:39,692
Come in.
Dinner will be a few minutes.

816
00:37:39,734 --> 00:37:41,634
Let me give you
the tour.

817
00:37:46,775 --> 00:37:48,265
What is all this stuff?

818
00:37:48,309 --> 00:37:50,174
Well, it's mostly stuff
from my grandfather

819
00:37:50,211 --> 00:37:51,678
or my great grandfather.

820
00:37:51,713 --> 00:37:55,080
My father is an expert
on vampirism.

821
00:37:55,116 --> 00:37:56,913
Told you my family's nuts.

822
00:37:56,951 --> 00:37:59,613
- What's this thing?
- Ah, well...

823
00:37:59,654 --> 00:38:02,350
if someone you suspect of being
a vampire dies,

824
00:38:02,390 --> 00:38:04,551
you place this over their neck
before they're buried

825
00:38:04,592 --> 00:38:07,686
and if they wake up and try
to climb out of their coffin,

826
00:38:07,729 --> 00:38:10,459
they get beheaded.

827
00:38:10,498 --> 00:38:12,432
Mrs. Van Helsing:
Dinner's ready!

828
00:38:22,143 --> 00:38:24,509
Hey, I know him.

829
00:38:24,546 --> 00:38:26,138
Van Helsing:
You know him?

830
00:38:26,181 --> 00:38:28,012
I mean,
I know who he is.

831
00:38:28,049 --> 00:38:29,880
It's Vlad Tepish.

832
00:38:29,918 --> 00:38:32,011
It's pronounced "Tee-pees."

833
00:38:32,053 --> 00:38:36,490
He was one of the most sadistic
figures in history.

834
00:38:36,524 --> 00:38:40,255
Well, I guess that sort of
depends on your point of view.

835
00:38:40,295 --> 00:38:41,922
Really?

836
00:38:41,963 --> 00:38:44,090
How many points of view
can there be on the subject

837
00:38:44,132 --> 00:38:46,896
of impaling people
and drinking their blood?

838
00:38:46,935 --> 00:38:49,130
If a weird stunt like that stops

839
00:38:49,170 --> 00:38:51,968
the entire Ottoman Empire
from taking over Europe.

840
00:38:52,006 --> 00:38:54,236
His armor is in
the museum in Bucharest.

841
00:38:54,275 --> 00:38:56,573
I mean, they consider
him a hero.

842
00:38:56,611 --> 00:38:59,774
Yeah, if it wasn't for him,
we'd all be speaking "Ottomanese."

843
00:38:59,814 --> 00:39:02,112
Didn't you like your fish?

844
00:39:02,150 --> 00:39:03,708
Shall we make
something else for you?

845
00:39:03,751 --> 00:39:06,811
Oh, no, thank you,
Mrs. Van Helsing.

846
00:39:06,855 --> 00:39:09,187
I'm enjoying my dinner
a great deal.

847
00:39:09,224 --> 00:39:13,217
Now, you must try our soup.

848
00:39:13,261 --> 00:39:15,661
It's an old Van Helsing recipe.

849
00:39:20,635 --> 00:39:22,330
Ahh!

850
00:39:22,370 --> 00:39:24,736
Not a fan of garlic?

851
00:39:24,772 --> 00:39:27,536
Stacy: Oh, no, it's not the garlic.
It's the salt.

852
00:39:27,575 --> 00:39:29,634
Even the tiniest bit
and I blow up

853
00:39:29,677 --> 00:39:32,111
like a Thanksgiving Day
balloon.

854
00:39:32,146 --> 00:39:33,943
My father thinks that
if he gives us garlic breath,

855
00:39:33,982 --> 00:39:35,574
we won't make out.

856
00:39:35,617 --> 00:39:37,608
Not going to work, Pops.

857
00:39:37,652 --> 00:39:40,086
Ma, we'll take dessert later.
The movie starts at 9:30.

858
00:39:40,121 --> 00:39:41,611
I'll just get our things.

859
00:39:44,959 --> 00:39:46,483
(breathes deeply)

860
00:39:55,937 --> 00:39:57,700
(laughs)

861
00:40:00,775 --> 00:40:02,504
Hmm.

862
00:40:02,543 --> 00:40:05,444
You have a very strong will,
Dr. Van Helsing.

863
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:07,744
What are your intentions
with my son?

864
00:40:07,782 --> 00:40:09,113
What do you mean?

865
00:40:09,150 --> 00:40:12,119
Do you plan to suck
the life out of him?

866
00:40:12,153 --> 00:40:15,020
No more than
any other girlfriend.

867
00:40:16,124 --> 00:40:17,751
Hey, you ready?

868
00:40:19,494 --> 00:40:21,189
Thank you for dinner.

869
00:40:21,229 --> 00:40:23,459
- See you later.
(doorbell rings)

870
00:40:24,999 --> 00:40:27,297
Oh, I know.
But did you see the girl

871
00:40:27,335 --> 00:40:29,530
who left with Joey?
Is she one of them?

872
00:40:29,570 --> 00:40:32,698
I wasn't really paying attention.
That girl, she seemed pretty dark.

873
00:40:32,740 --> 00:40:35,538
But it's all gonna be on my phone.
So hold on.

874
00:40:35,576 --> 00:40:38,511
Wait, I don't remember
seeing empty chairs.

875
00:40:38,546 --> 00:40:40,309
What did I do wrong?

876
00:40:40,348 --> 00:40:42,976
You didn't do
anything wrong.

877
00:40:43,017 --> 00:40:45,247
(singing)

878
00:40:45,286 --> 00:40:47,516
(beeps)

879
00:40:51,559 --> 00:40:53,254
Why do people
bother going out

880
00:40:53,294 --> 00:40:54,886
if the only thing
they want to bond with

881
00:40:54,929 --> 00:40:56,294
is their little
glowing boxes?

882
00:40:56,331 --> 00:40:58,162
Don't go grandma on me.

883
00:40:58,199 --> 00:40:59,928
- Oh, there's Renfield.
- Hey.

884
00:40:59,968 --> 00:41:02,334
Uh, you guys, um...

885
00:41:02,370 --> 00:41:05,203
kinda can't sit here unless
we order a $400 bottle.

886
00:41:05,239 --> 00:41:07,469
- Don't worry about it.
Waitress: - Bottle service.

887
00:41:09,610 --> 00:41:12,545
She left him 10 minutes ago.
The sex must be great.

888
00:41:12,580 --> 00:41:14,707
Oh, we haven't done it yet.

889
00:41:14,749 --> 00:41:17,115
Oh, so it's a purely
textual relationship?

890
00:41:18,786 --> 00:41:21,584
I've been looking for you,
you lifeless bitch.

891
00:41:21,622 --> 00:41:23,180
What is your problem?

892
00:41:23,224 --> 00:41:25,021
What did you do to Ivan?

893
00:41:25,059 --> 00:41:26,526
What are you talking about?

894
00:41:26,561 --> 00:41:28,586
(hissing)

895
00:41:28,629 --> 00:41:31,655
(lisping) First you kill
my game with Juicy girl.

896
00:41:31,699 --> 00:41:33,599
Now Ivan is missing.

897
00:41:33,634 --> 00:41:35,363
Suckerin' succotash.

898
00:41:35,403 --> 00:41:37,234
(growling)

899
00:41:37,271 --> 00:41:39,239
- Guys, guys, guys!
(screaming)

900
00:41:39,273 --> 00:41:41,104
Not in front of the day players.

901
00:41:42,176 --> 00:41:44,007
The past few minutes,
you remember nothing.

902
00:41:44,045 --> 00:41:45,342
Complete Sergeant Schultz.

903
00:41:45,380 --> 00:41:47,075
(German accent)
I know nothing!

904
00:41:47,115 --> 00:41:49,845
- I saw nothing!
- Now cut it out.

905
00:41:49,884 --> 00:41:52,352
Besides, why would
we hurt Ivan?

906
00:41:52,387 --> 00:41:54,753
We'd just wind up doing
more work for Cisserus.

907
00:41:54,789 --> 00:41:56,381
Actually, it's a good thing
we ran into you.

908
00:41:56,424 --> 00:41:58,619
We need you to come to
a Sanguines Anonymous meeting.

909
00:41:58,659 --> 00:42:00,752
- No way.
- You don't have to join,

910
00:42:00,795 --> 00:42:02,956
but a lot of weird stuff
has been going down.

911
00:42:02,997 --> 00:42:04,760
They're trying to force us
out into the sun.

912
00:42:04,799 --> 00:42:07,563
You think this has something
to do with Ivan's disappearance?

913
00:42:07,602 --> 00:42:09,092
It might.

914
00:42:09,137 --> 00:42:11,765
Did anyone in his building
see anything?

915
00:42:11,806 --> 00:42:13,865
The neighbor said the cable
company was there.

916
00:42:13,908 --> 00:42:16,741
Can Time Warner just burst into
a person's home and kill them?

917
00:42:16,778 --> 00:42:18,405
Yeah, they're terrible.

918
00:42:18,446 --> 00:42:20,243
(sighs)

919
00:42:20,281 --> 00:42:22,340
Come to a meeting.
We've got to figure this out.

920
00:42:22,383 --> 00:42:24,010
Everybody's getting audited.

921
00:42:24,052 --> 00:42:25,713
Well, you don't have to go.

922
00:42:25,753 --> 00:42:27,152
What?

923
00:42:27,188 --> 00:42:29,088
An audit is just
the IRS saying,

924
00:42:29,123 --> 00:42:30,613
"We think you should
pay more taxes."

925
00:42:30,658 --> 00:42:32,649
And if you agree with them,
then you say, "Okay, how much?"

926
00:42:32,693 --> 00:42:35,491
But you only have to go in
if you wanna challenge them.

927
00:42:35,530 --> 00:42:37,157
How do you know this?

928
00:42:37,198 --> 00:42:38,665
I'm a CPA.

929
00:42:38,699 --> 00:42:40,189
- You are?
- Yeah.

930
00:42:40,234 --> 00:42:41,724
You just got
some new clients.

931
00:42:43,237 --> 00:42:44,805
Not me.
I have a guy.

932
00:42:44,806 --> 00:42:46,899
(music playing)

933
00:42:57,118 --> 00:42:58,608
Stacy:
What are you wearing?

934
00:42:58,653 --> 00:43:00,416
It's like the history
of fashion.

935
00:43:00,455 --> 00:43:04,050
I'm going to see Danny.
I wanna look nice.

936
00:43:04,092 --> 00:43:06,253
Gibson Girl shirts
were the prettiest.

937
00:43:06,294 --> 00:43:09,127
1960s skirts are great
on short women.

938
00:43:09,163 --> 00:43:12,496
1970s shoes make you tall
but are comfortable.

939
00:43:12,533 --> 00:43:14,364
Okay, but what's
with the hat?

940
00:43:14,402 --> 00:43:15,801
It's a boater.

941
00:43:15,837 --> 00:43:17,634
People always said
it looked spiffy on me.

942
00:43:17,672 --> 00:43:19,731
People from
your barbershop quartet

943
00:43:19,774 --> 00:43:22,004
or people from
the Republican convention?

944
00:43:22,043 --> 00:43:24,068
Oh, God.

945
00:43:25,913 --> 00:43:27,107
Here we are.

946
00:43:27,148 --> 00:43:29,639
"Architectural Digest" time.
Enjoy yourself.

947
00:43:29,684 --> 00:43:31,049
Sure you don't
want anything to drink?

948
00:43:31,085 --> 00:43:32,814
- I'm sure.
- Well, I'm not.

949
00:43:32,854 --> 00:43:34,879
I need some coffee, man.
For energy.

950
00:43:37,191 --> 00:43:38,658
I just made this last week.

951
00:43:38,693 --> 00:43:40,684
- Oh.
- You work for the government?

952
00:43:40,728 --> 00:43:42,719
Do I look like I work
for the government?

953
00:43:42,763 --> 00:43:44,390
I'm with the ACLU.

954
00:43:44,432 --> 00:43:46,992
Right now I'm in the middle
of this deportation case

955
00:43:47,034 --> 00:43:50,834
with abuses of wiretapping.
It's unbearable.

956
00:43:50,872 --> 00:43:52,737
Well, I thought
if the government

957
00:43:52,773 --> 00:43:55,503
doesn't hear terrorist-related stuff,
they have to hang up.

958
00:43:55,543 --> 00:43:57,340
No.

959
00:43:58,346 --> 00:43:59,677
Ah, look at this.

960
00:43:59,714 --> 00:44:01,545
I was going through these
looking for your mother.

961
00:44:04,619 --> 00:44:06,086
Look at these.

962
00:44:06,120 --> 00:44:08,145
She had this habit of just

963
00:44:08,189 --> 00:44:11,750
ducking out right before
they took a picture.

964
00:44:11,792 --> 00:44:13,783
Well, she was superstitious.

965
00:44:13,828 --> 00:44:15,591
Still, I mean,
it's a little nutty, isn't it?

966
00:44:15,630 --> 00:44:17,029
My God.

967
00:44:17,064 --> 00:44:19,191
- I have this one.
- You do? Really?

968
00:44:19,233 --> 00:44:21,030
She saved it?

969
00:44:21,068 --> 00:44:22,831
You better put yours
in plastic.

970
00:44:22,870 --> 00:44:24,929
She liked this, huh?
Well, why not?

971
00:44:24,972 --> 00:44:27,270
I was not bad-looking
back then, huh?

972
00:44:28,676 --> 00:44:30,541
What an amazing
time this was.

973
00:44:30,578 --> 00:44:33,479
Being young and in love.

974
00:44:33,514 --> 00:44:36,039
Feeling like you're a part of
something that really mattered.

975
00:44:37,885 --> 00:44:40,285
Your mother never mentioned
why she just disappeared?

976
00:44:40,321 --> 00:44:42,949
- Not really.
- Oh, man.

977
00:44:42,990 --> 00:44:44,582
Hey, you know what?

978
00:44:44,625 --> 00:44:48,391
I have to get movies for my wife
before the store closes.

979
00:44:48,429 --> 00:44:50,863
- Right on.
- Huh?

980
00:44:50,898 --> 00:44:52,798
My way.

981
00:44:52,833 --> 00:44:55,097
- I'll go with.
- Oh.

982
00:44:55,136 --> 00:44:56,626
All right, cool.

983
00:44:56,671 --> 00:44:58,764
You know,
Angela is really in and out.

984
00:44:58,806 --> 00:45:01,536
And that's why I gotta get her
movies that she really loves.

985
00:45:01,576 --> 00:45:03,168
So, you know,
when she dozes off,

986
00:45:03,211 --> 00:45:05,042
you know, she won't miss
anything, really.

987
00:45:05,079 --> 00:45:07,138
- Can I help?
- Uh, no.

988
00:45:07,181 --> 00:45:08,842
When I see 'em,
I'll know it.

989
00:45:08,883 --> 00:45:11,443
- Then I'm gonna look around.
- Okay, cool.

990
00:45:14,088 --> 00:45:15,885
(groans)
Excuse me.

991
00:45:15,923 --> 00:45:17,720
Do you have any
James Cagney posters?

992
00:45:17,758 --> 00:45:19,123
Oh, James Cameron?

993
00:45:21,262 --> 00:45:23,025
No, uh, James Cagney.

994
00:45:23,064 --> 00:45:25,555
You know, "Made it, Ma!
Top of the world!"

995
00:45:25,600 --> 00:45:27,227
(chuckles)
No.

996
00:45:27,268 --> 00:45:28,929
What about...

997
00:45:28,970 --> 00:45:30,801
- Fred Astaire?
- No.

998
00:45:30,838 --> 00:45:32,499
- Jack Lemmon?
- No.

999
00:45:32,540 --> 00:45:35,771
- Paul Newman.
- Oh, the salad dressing guy?

1000
00:45:37,678 --> 00:45:40,511
- Yeah.
- No.

1001
00:45:46,053 --> 00:45:47,577
Phones on the ground.

1002
00:45:47,622 --> 00:45:50,750
Phones on the ground now.
Drop 'em!

1003
00:45:50,791 --> 00:45:52,691
Hands in the air. Hands in the air.
Give me the money.

1004
00:45:52,727 --> 00:45:54,285
Woman: Don't you point that.
He's got a heart condition.

1005
00:45:54,328 --> 00:45:56,296
- Shut up!
- Oh, my God!

1006
00:45:56,330 --> 00:45:58,059
Fuck.
Come on!

1007
00:45:58,099 --> 00:45:59,896
- He's having a heart attack.
- No, no, no, lady.

1008
00:45:59,934 --> 00:46:01,401
Get up and give me
the money now.

1009
00:46:01,435 --> 00:46:03,733
- Shit, come on!
- Oh!

1010
00:46:06,007 --> 00:46:07,736
Stop it.

1011
00:46:07,775 --> 00:46:09,037
Calm down.

1012
00:46:10,711 --> 00:46:12,645
(hisses)

1013
00:46:15,383 --> 00:46:16,941
(sighs)

1014
00:46:20,655 --> 00:46:22,418
Mm.
Feel better?

1015
00:46:22,456 --> 00:46:24,390
Yeah.
(chuckles)

1016
00:46:25,459 --> 00:46:27,188
You are gonna take this couple
to the hospital.

1017
00:46:27,228 --> 00:46:28,991
And no more stealing

1018
00:46:29,030 --> 00:46:30,463
The bite was from your cat.

1019
00:46:30,498 --> 00:46:32,898
You guys,
take CPR courses.

1020
00:46:32,933 --> 00:46:35,493
You hate junk food.

1021
00:46:35,536 --> 00:46:37,367
And get "Public Enemy."

1022
00:46:37,405 --> 00:46:39,532
The Cagney one.

1023
00:46:41,208 --> 00:46:42,835
You all right?

1024
00:46:43,911 --> 00:46:46,379
I could hypnotize you,

1025
00:46:46,414 --> 00:46:48,974
but I've been wanting to tell you.

1026
00:46:49,984 --> 00:46:51,781
So what are you saying?
You broke up with me 'cause

1027
00:46:51,819 --> 00:46:54,049
you wouldn't drink my blood?
Is that what you're telling me?

1028
00:46:54,088 --> 00:46:56,750
I don't drink human blood.

1029
00:46:56,791 --> 00:46:59,726
You don't?
That guy, what was that?

1030
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:03,161
No. Have you ever seen
a vampire bat?

1031
00:47:04,665 --> 00:47:07,964
A little rodent can get
the blood out of an entire cow

1032
00:47:08,002 --> 00:47:10,903
in a few minutes because
of this enzyme in their saliva.

1033
00:47:10,938 --> 00:47:13,202
It's a completely safe
blood thinner.

1034
00:47:13,240 --> 00:47:14,867
And I also have it.

1035
00:47:14,909 --> 00:47:17,377
I didn't drink
that man's blood.

1036
00:47:17,411 --> 00:47:20,209
I spit into him
to stop the stroke.

1037
00:47:20,247 --> 00:47:23,045
Oh.
You just spit into him.

1038
00:47:23,084 --> 00:47:25,018
Oh, that's a whole
other ball game.

1039
00:47:25,052 --> 00:47:27,919
Well, if I didn't, he would have
had a lot of brain damage.

1040
00:47:27,955 --> 00:47:29,388
How old are you?

1041
00:47:31,625 --> 00:47:33,115
A little older than you.

1042
00:47:33,160 --> 00:47:35,720
So people can only be
around you for, like, what...

1043
00:47:35,763 --> 00:47:36,957
a year or something?

1044
00:47:36,997 --> 00:47:38,862
No, I could go around
seven years

1045
00:47:38,899 --> 00:47:40,890
without them expecting
me to look older.

1046
00:47:40,935 --> 00:47:44,427
And I would've stayed with
you for as long as possible.

1047
00:47:44,472 --> 00:47:46,406
But when you became
one of the student leaders,

1048
00:47:46,440 --> 00:47:49,170
people on the street
recognized you.

1049
00:47:49,210 --> 00:47:52,373
I thought,
"This is his time."

1050
00:47:52,413 --> 00:47:56,110
You could have your choice
of any woman out there.

1051
00:47:56,150 --> 00:47:58,084
It didn't seem right
to rob you of the chance

1052
00:47:58,119 --> 00:48:00,053
to meet someone amazing.

1053
00:48:01,789 --> 00:48:04,451
And you did, didn't you?

1054
00:48:04,492 --> 00:48:06,960
I did.
I really did.

1055
00:48:06,994 --> 00:48:08,723
And you know what?
I really should check

1056
00:48:08,763 --> 00:48:10,731
and see how she's doing.

1057
00:48:10,765 --> 00:48:12,096
And I gotta tell
you something else.

1058
00:48:12,133 --> 00:48:15,034
I feel like I'm really, like,
tripping right now.

1059
00:48:15,069 --> 00:48:17,264
Am I gonna see you again?

1060
00:48:17,304 --> 00:48:19,704
Uh...

1061
00:48:19,740 --> 00:48:22,208
of course, yeah.

1062
00:48:23,210 --> 00:48:25,770

Stacy: Okay, this is Germany
before World War II.

1072
00:49:21,535 --> 00:49:23,469
The sleepwalker
keeps murdering people,

1073
00:49:23,504 --> 00:49:25,836
but only because the evil guy
has him under a spell.

1074
00:49:25,873 --> 00:49:28,103
What does that remind you of?

1075
00:49:29,109 --> 00:49:30,838
I'm flummoxed.

1076
00:49:30,878 --> 00:49:33,403
Germany?
Evil spell?

1077
00:49:33,447 --> 00:49:35,005
Adolf?

1078
00:49:35,049 --> 00:49:36,812
Your eyes remind me
of somebody.

1079
00:49:36,851 --> 00:49:38,716
Adolf Hitler.

1080
00:49:38,752 --> 00:49:40,481
No, that wasn't
who I was thinking of.

1081
00:49:40,521 --> 00:49:43,684
Audrey Hepburn.
Same initials, though.

1082
00:49:43,724 --> 00:49:46,352
Can you please just focus
on symbolism?

1083
00:49:46,393 --> 00:49:48,384
Sorry.

1084
00:49:49,497 --> 00:49:51,431
Joey:
Can I be under your spell?

1085
00:49:51,465 --> 00:49:53,330
Or better still,
you could be under my spell.

1086
00:49:53,367 --> 00:49:55,130
What are you
gonna make me do?

1087
00:49:55,169 --> 00:49:57,262
Laugh hysterically.

1088

Not since the '80s.

(birds chirping)
(gasps)

1102
00:50:36,043 --> 00:50:37,533
Hey, where are you going?

1103
00:50:37,578 --> 00:50:38,943
Um, I've got an early class.

1104
00:50:38,979 --> 00:50:40,708
Well, ditch it
and come back to bed.

1105
00:50:40,748 --> 00:50:43,842
I can't.
But I'll call you later.

1106
00:50:43,884 --> 00:50:45,511
Come on, my parents won't
be home until tomorrow.

1107
00:50:45,553 --> 00:50:48,579
Look, it's a little early in the
relationship to get into this,

1108
00:50:48,622 --> 00:50:50,055
but I've really gotta go.

1109
00:51:03,003 --> 00:51:04,732
What the...

1110
00:51:04,772 --> 00:51:07,070
(stammering)

1111
00:51:11,211 --> 00:51:13,179
- Something bothering you?
- What?

1112
00:51:14,281 --> 00:51:15,612
No.

1113
00:51:15,649 --> 00:51:17,514
(phone rings)
(gasps)

1114
00:51:17,551 --> 00:51:20,042
If there's anything
you wanna talk about...

1115
00:51:20,087 --> 00:51:22,851
maybe trouble
with Stacy, or...

1116
00:51:26,694 --> 00:51:28,457
Yeah, 'cause you'd love that.

1117
00:51:28,495 --> 00:51:31,521
He's not answering my texts,
my tweets, my e-mails,

1118
00:51:31,565 --> 00:51:32,930
my voicemail,
my Facebook messages...

1119
00:51:32,967 --> 00:51:34,434
Do you think
he'll tell his father?

1120
00:51:34,468 --> 00:51:36,459
No, he wouldn't do that.
What about Danny?

1121
00:51:36,503 --> 00:51:37,936
Do you think he'll
tell the authorities?

1122
00:51:37,972 --> 00:51:40,099
- He'd never.
- How do you know?

1123
00:51:40,140 --> 00:51:41,630
Danny hates authority.

1124
00:51:41,675 --> 00:51:43,472
I'm gonna go to his class
so he has to confront me.

1125
00:51:46,146 --> 00:51:47,738
- Are you mad at me?
(screams)

1126
00:51:49,083 --> 00:51:50,607
- Don't go away.
- Huh? What?

1127
00:51:54,755 --> 00:51:56,586
- Really?
- Yeah.

1128
00:51:57,591 --> 00:51:59,786
How do you like
them apples?

1129
00:51:59,827 --> 00:52:01,886
Garlic?

1130
00:52:01,929 --> 00:52:03,055
You were afraid of it
the other night.

1131
00:52:03,097 --> 00:52:05,497
Yeah, because
I've always hated garlic.

1132
00:52:07,301 --> 00:52:08,859
Can we please just
talk about this?

1133
00:52:08,902 --> 00:52:11,632
- My father tried to warn me.
- Against what?

1134
00:52:11,672 --> 00:52:14,106
I have never harmed a human
being or a domestic animal

1135
00:52:14,141 --> 00:52:15,802
my entire life.

1136
00:52:15,843 --> 00:52:18,175
Oh, so you didn't go after me
'cause I'm a Van Helsing?

1137
00:52:18,212 --> 00:52:20,840
No. If anything,
I would've stayed away.

1138
00:52:20,881 --> 00:52:22,371
Besides, if I wanted
to drink your blood,

1139
00:52:22,416 --> 00:52:24,976
would I have written you
this 10-page report

1140
00:52:25,019 --> 00:52:28,284
on Freud and his influence
on surrealist imagery?

1141
00:52:32,526 --> 00:52:35,017
How do I know
you wrote this for me?

1142
00:52:35,062 --> 00:52:37,826
Because I also wrote one
on World War I

1143
00:52:37,865 --> 00:52:39,992
and how it gave birth
to Surrealism.

1144
00:52:40,034 --> 00:52:41,524
Actually, I like
that one better.

1145
00:52:41,568 --> 00:52:43,365
Oh, you do?

1146
00:52:43,404 --> 00:52:45,634
So now you trust me, huh?

1147
00:52:45,673 --> 00:52:47,106
I trust you to give yourself
the better grade.

1148
00:52:47,141 --> 00:52:48,574
I don't blame you.

1149
00:52:57,418 --> 00:52:59,579
You know
I would never hurt you, right?

1150
00:52:59,620 --> 00:53:01,679
Yeah.

1151
00:53:01,722 --> 00:53:03,587
Well, then what is it?
Is it the day thing?

1152
00:53:03,624 --> 00:53:05,421
Do you want to have a girlfriend

1153
00:53:05,459 --> 00:53:07,120
you can go hiking with
and go to the beach?

1154
00:53:07,161 --> 00:53:10,494
No, I'm... I'm more of
a night person.

1155
00:53:10,531 --> 00:53:12,021
Is it the blood, then?

1156
00:53:12,066 --> 00:53:15,558
- You wanna try new restaurants?
- No, I'm not much of a foodie.

1157
00:53:15,602 --> 00:53:17,263
So what is it?

1158
00:53:17,304 --> 00:53:19,204

1159
00:53:19,239 --> 00:53:21,707

the entire population would've
eaten itself off the planet

1192

Iong before Christ
was even born.

1193
00:55:13,187 --> 00:55:15,849

1195
00:55:17,424 --> 00:55:19,221

- Ukrainian.

All: - Hi, Ashwan.

1204
00:55:39,046 --> 00:55:41,674

Excuse me.

1210
00:55:52,125 --> 00:55:55,754
Why do not
we just eat the lawyers?

1211
00:55:55,796 --> 00:55:59,391
You crazy.
We can't eat all the lawyers.

1212
00:55:59,433 --> 00:56:00,730
Why not?

1213
00:56:00,767 --> 00:56:02,826
Let's just say eating lawyers
is out of the question.

1214
00:56:02,870 --> 00:56:04,337
(groaning)
- I know you can sense

1215
00:56:04,371 --> 00:56:06,396
that we have
day players among us.

1216
00:56:06,440 --> 00:56:08,840
This is my granddaughter,
Sarah.

1217
00:56:08,876 --> 00:56:11,071
All: - Hi, Sarah.
- And this is our friend Renfield.

1218
00:56:11,111 --> 00:56:13,341
He's a CPA so he can help
with the IRS stuff.

1219
00:56:13,380 --> 00:56:16,611
And I understand
we have a lawyer here.

1220
00:56:16,650 --> 00:56:18,208
You absolutely do.

1221
00:56:18,252 --> 00:56:20,652
How you doin?
My name is Danny.

1222
00:56:20,687 --> 00:56:23,281
All: - Hi, Danny.
- And I'm from the ACLU.

1223
00:56:23,323 --> 00:56:25,553
From what I understand,
you can't be forced out

1224
00:56:25,592 --> 00:56:28,425
during the day and you don't
want anyone to molest

1225
00:56:28,462 --> 00:56:30,430
your resting places.

1226
00:56:30,464 --> 00:56:33,194
But the government can enter
your home any time they want

1227
00:56:33,233 --> 00:56:34,632
because of the Patriot Act.

1228
00:56:34,668 --> 00:56:36,693
See what's going down now

1229
00:56:36,737 --> 00:56:39,900
is that all your cell phones
and your iPhones

1230
00:56:39,940 --> 00:56:42,534
and all the computers
are helping them find you.

1231
00:56:42,576 --> 00:56:46,672
So I urge you not to use
any of your electronic devices.

1232
00:56:46,713 --> 00:56:49,273
How will we do anything?

1233
00:56:49,316 --> 00:56:51,113
How do we even stay in touch
with each other?

1234
00:56:51,151 --> 00:56:53,244
I used to write things down.

1235
00:56:53,287 --> 00:56:56,484
- Oh, yeah. Like in a datebook.
- Right.

1236
00:56:56,523 --> 00:56:59,151
But I need my computer
to tell me sunrise and sunset.

1237
00:56:59,192 --> 00:57:01,387
Oh, I can tell everyone that
on my almanac.

1238
00:57:04,998 --> 00:57:07,899
Under "Sky Watch,"
it's got phases of the moon,

1239
00:57:07,935 --> 00:57:11,803
high tide, sunrise and sunset,
and... good Lord!

1240
00:57:11,838 --> 00:57:13,328
What?
What is it?

1241
00:57:13,373 --> 00:57:16,171
Total eclipse of the sun
in two weeks.

1242
00:57:16,209 --> 00:57:17,437
(gasps)
Goody: - Hold on, hold on.

1243
00:57:17,477 --> 00:57:19,570
2:10 to 3:40.

1244
00:57:19,613 --> 00:57:21,513
Too bad that wasn't
the exact time of our summons.

1245
00:57:21,548 --> 00:57:23,482
If we had face time,
we could use hypnotism.

1246
00:57:24,484 --> 00:57:26,611
No, why? That wouldn't
make any difference.

1247
00:57:26,653 --> 00:57:28,746
Couldn't we just change
the times of the appointments?

1248
00:57:28,789 --> 00:57:31,417
Yeah. We could get you
completely eliminated

1249
00:57:31,458 --> 00:57:33,221
from their system.
We could delete and change

1250
00:57:33,260 --> 00:57:34,591
everything
in their computers.

1251
00:57:34,628 --> 00:57:36,994
You know,
I can see why

1252
00:57:37,030 --> 00:57:38,691
you have sworn off
human blood.

1253
00:57:38,732 --> 00:57:40,597
Awesome.
Do you want to join?

1254
00:57:40,634 --> 00:57:42,693
How would you ladies
like to be my wives?

1255
00:57:42,736 --> 00:57:44,328
(scoffs)
Eat me.

1256
00:57:44,371 --> 00:57:47,272
- All right.
- Not literally.

1257
00:57:48,642 --> 00:57:51,304
(music playing)

1258
00:57:52,846 --> 00:57:55,144
(rats squeaking)

1259
00:57:58,218 --> 00:58:00,778
Oh, are you okay?

1260
00:58:00,821 --> 00:58:03,187
You were sick yesterday, too.

1261
00:58:03,223 --> 00:58:04,690
(vomits)

1262
00:58:04,725 --> 00:58:06,886
Look what I got you.

1263
00:58:06,927 --> 00:58:08,861
(gasps)
- Pure pharmaceutical grade.

1264
00:58:08,895 --> 00:58:11,159
Oh, but they're so cute.

1265
00:58:11,198 --> 00:58:14,190
They're not like vermin.
They could be somebody's pets. Hi!

1266
00:58:14,234 --> 00:58:15,667
I figured they wouldn't
make you sick.

1267
00:58:15,702 --> 00:58:17,499
It's nothing.
I'm fine.

1268
00:58:17,537 --> 00:58:19,971
It's just when I get up.

1269
00:58:20,007 --> 00:58:22,601
Quit futzing.
We have to go.

1270
00:58:24,845 --> 00:58:26,335
Oh, don't start with me.

1271
00:58:26,380 --> 00:58:29,178
- Drop waists are coming back.
- Yeah, says who?

1272
00:58:29,216 --> 00:58:31,343
I saw a picture
of Keira Knightley in one.

1273
00:58:31,385 --> 00:58:32,818
Yeah, right.

1274
00:58:32,853 --> 00:58:35,185
That's because
Keira Knightley's in a movie.

1275
00:58:35,222 --> 00:58:38,191
- Ha, look at you!
- I know.

1276
00:58:38,225 --> 00:58:40,318
This was
my college interview outfit.

1277
00:58:40,360 --> 00:58:42,225
Were you trying
for a football scholarship?

1278
00:58:42,262 --> 00:58:45,026
Ha-ha. It's the only thing
I have that looks respectful.

1279
00:58:45,065 --> 00:58:46,259
(laughs)

1280
00:58:46,299 --> 00:58:48,733
Child: - Whoa, check it out.
Man: - I know, it's crazy.

1281
00:58:48,769 --> 00:58:52,705
Child 2: Mom, look!
I've never seen it before.

1282
00:58:52,739 --> 00:58:56,698
Mother: Don't look
directly at it, honey.

1283
00:58:56,743 --> 00:58:59,541
Wow, I totally forgot
what it was like.

1284
00:58:59,579 --> 00:59:01,843
It's an entirely
different world.

1285
00:59:01,882 --> 00:59:04,316
Oh, so many women.

1286
00:59:04,351 --> 00:59:05,477
Have a nice day.

1287
00:59:05,519 --> 00:59:08,147
Come on, everybody. Let's go.
We only have two hours.

1288
00:59:08,188 --> 00:59:10,383
Hey, so do you know
where we're going?

1289
00:59:10,424 --> 00:59:11,721
You will do what
my accountant says.

1290
00:59:11,758 --> 00:59:12,918
It's CPA.

1291
00:59:18,698 --> 00:59:20,928
Okay, this is Ghuri.

1292
00:59:20,967 --> 00:59:23,265
This is file number 318.

1293
00:59:23,303 --> 00:59:24,930
This Vlad Tepish.

1294
00:59:24,971 --> 00:59:27,439
He was granted asylum in, um...

1295
00:59:27,474 --> 00:59:29,635
1583.

1296
00:59:29,676 --> 00:59:33,168
Currently married
to a US citizen.

1297
00:59:33,213 --> 00:59:35,272
Well, four.

1298
00:59:35,315 --> 00:59:36,339
Yeah, that's okay.

1299
00:59:36,383 --> 00:59:38,408
Child of
an American fiancée.

1300
00:59:38,452 --> 00:59:40,113
For an adjustment
of status.

1301
00:59:40,153 --> 00:59:42,986
A student visa so
he can matriculate at UCLA.

1302
00:59:43,023 --> 00:59:44,513
Go Bruins.

1303
00:59:44,558 --> 00:59:45,957
Yeah.

1304
00:59:50,997 --> 00:59:54,364
Stacy Daimer is unable to perform
jury duty obligations.

1305
00:59:54,401 --> 00:59:56,961
Unable to perform
jury duty obligations.

1306
00:59:57,003 --> 00:59:59,369
- In fact, I'll just delete them.
- Just delete them.

1307
00:59:59,406 --> 01:00:00,998
Put the deleted names
in the trash.

1308
01:00:01,041 --> 01:00:02,440
Deleted names in trash.

1309
01:00:02,476 --> 01:00:03,807
- Empty the trash.
- Empty the trash.

1310
01:00:03,844 --> 01:00:07,143
Ask the IT guy
to remove the hard drive.

1311
01:00:07,180 --> 01:00:09,842
- Go, go, go!
- Excuse us, coming through!

1312
01:00:09,883 --> 01:00:11,942
(squealing)

1313
01:00:16,022 --> 01:00:18,081
(music playing)

1314
01:00:33,173 --> 01:00:35,232
Man: Joey!

1315
01:00:52,592 --> 01:00:54,856
Man 2: Yeah!

1316
01:00:54,895 --> 01:00:57,363
(squeaking)

1317
01:00:59,232 --> 01:01:01,029
Let me see. Open.

1318
01:01:01,067 --> 01:01:03,331
(makes kissing noises)

1319
01:01:03,370 --> 01:01:05,065
Hold it up.
Hold it up.

1320
01:01:05,105 --> 01:01:06,970
Aw, beautiful color.

1321
01:01:07,007 --> 01:01:10,534
They're having the book launch
party for The Situation

1322
01:01:10,577 --> 01:01:12,442
right now on 10th.
What do you say?

1323
01:01:12,479 --> 01:01:13,912
- Ugh.
- Not worth the candle.

1324
01:01:13,947 --> 01:01:15,380
We're happy here.

1325
01:01:15,415 --> 01:01:17,576
Every A-lister in New York
will be there.

1326
01:01:17,617 --> 01:01:19,448
You can have
whoever you want.

1327
01:01:19,486 --> 01:01:21,545
Mm.
You get tired of that.

1328
01:01:23,156 --> 01:01:24,919
(gasps)
Oh, I like this song.

1329
01:01:24,958 --> 01:01:26,482
- You wanna dance.
- Yeah, do you?

1330
01:01:26,526 --> 01:01:28,391
- Yeah.
- Okay.

1331
01:01:28,428 --> 01:01:30,555
(phone beeps)

1332
01:01:34,434 --> 01:01:35,924
Aren't you gonna dance?

1333
01:01:35,969 --> 01:01:37,300
Me?
I don't think so.

1334
01:01:37,337 --> 01:01:40,204
- I'm not very good, no.
- Yes, you are.

1335
01:01:40,240 --> 01:01:42,401
- I remember.
- Yeah, but I don't remember.

1336
01:01:42,442 --> 01:01:45,605

1337
01:01:45,645 --> 01:01:49,308

Joey had to go.
His dad is bugging out.

1348
01:02:24,951 --> 01:02:26,816
- Problems at work, no doubt.
(phone chimes)

1349
01:02:28,588 --> 01:02:30,317
Hmm.
Wonder who that could be.

1350
01:02:30,357 --> 01:02:32,587
Oh, isn't it insane?

1351
01:02:32,626 --> 01:02:34,423
I was dating for 25 years

1352
01:02:34,461 --> 01:02:37,487
and I've never imagined to feel
this way about somebody.

1353
01:02:37,530 --> 01:02:39,327
What about
you and Danny?

1354
01:02:39,366 --> 01:02:41,527
Mm, I never stopped
loving him.

1355
01:02:41,568 --> 01:02:44,560
But his wife's sick so there's
no even thinking about it.

1356
01:02:44,604 --> 01:02:46,401
I'm just happy around him.

1357
01:02:46,439 --> 01:02:47,963
Reminds me
of being hopeful.

1358
01:02:48,008 --> 01:02:50,602
But how great would it be
if we both had relationships?

1359
01:02:50,644 --> 01:02:52,271
I mean,
wouldn't it be so cool...

1360
01:02:52,312 --> 01:02:53,836
Cisserus's voice:
Mott Street.

1361
01:02:53,880 --> 01:02:55,871
Mott Street.
Oh!

1362
01:02:55,915 --> 01:02:57,644
What is she doing
back so soon?

1363
01:02:57,684 --> 01:02:59,174
I guess things didn't
work out with Diego.

1364
01:02:59,219 --> 01:03:00,652
- Ugh.
- She's in Chinatown.

1365
01:03:00,687 --> 01:03:03,223
God, just when things
were going so well.

1366
01:03:03,224 --> 01:03:04,781
(growls)

1367
01:03:04,824 --> 01:03:07,224
Mm.

1368
01:03:07,260 --> 01:03:09,455
Oh... oh, God.

1369
01:03:09,496 --> 01:03:10,861
(burps)

1370
01:03:10,897 --> 01:03:13,297
I've never seen
real dead people.

1371
01:03:13,333 --> 01:03:14,766
What did you do?

1372
01:03:14,801 --> 01:03:16,530
(Yiddish accent)
You know how it is

1373
01:03:16,569 --> 01:03:18,935
when you eat Chinese.

1374
01:03:18,972 --> 01:03:21,497
Half an hour later
you're hungry again.

1375
01:03:21,541 --> 01:03:23,202
How could you?

1376
01:03:23,243 --> 01:03:24,938
(groans)

1377
01:03:24,978 --> 01:03:27,276
Oh, I just can't
stop eating.

1378
01:03:27,314 --> 01:03:28,872
I'm so depressed.

1379
01:03:28,915 --> 01:03:31,145
Why didn't he like me?

1380
01:03:31,184 --> 01:03:34,244
I am so much more bomb-ass
than his girlfriend.

1381
01:03:34,287 --> 01:03:36,812
Maybe she wasn't
a homicidal maniac.

1382
01:03:36,856 --> 01:03:38,084
Maybe.

1383
01:03:38,124 --> 01:03:40,319
This is disgusting!

1384
01:03:40,360 --> 01:03:41,691
I know.

1385
01:03:41,728 --> 01:03:44,196
I could so easily
hate myself.

1386
01:03:44,230 --> 01:03:47,324
But just because
you overdid it one day,

1387
01:03:47,367 --> 01:03:50,165
doesn't mean
you have to be bad all weekend.

1388
01:03:50,203 --> 01:03:51,864
- What's wrong with him?
(waiter moaning)

1389
01:03:51,905 --> 01:03:53,395
(laughing)

1390
01:03:53,440 --> 01:03:55,635
Finish him off,
will ya?

1391
01:03:58,411 --> 01:04:01,005
I said kill him.

1392
01:04:02,282 --> 01:04:03,772
(sighs)

1393
01:04:12,225 --> 01:04:15,388
(sighs)
You really can't kill.

1394
01:04:15,428 --> 01:04:18,625
You guys are so useless.

1395
01:04:18,665 --> 01:04:20,326
Forget it.

1396
01:04:21,868 --> 01:04:25,235
Hey, can I have
a fortune cookie, at least?

1397
01:04:29,376 --> 01:04:31,207
(birds chirping)

1398
01:04:37,617 --> 01:04:40,085
(phone rings)
Goody: - That was way too close.

1399
01:04:40,120 --> 01:04:41,610
Stacy:
And I didn't put in rollers.

1400
01:04:41,654 --> 01:04:43,178
I'm gonna have
coffin hair tomorrow.

1401
01:04:43,223 --> 01:04:44,850
Goody:
I know.

1402
01:04:44,891 --> 01:04:48,383
Stacy: Goody, I don't think I can
do anything like that again.

1403
01:04:48,428 --> 01:04:50,157
Goody:
Me either.

1404
01:04:57,170 --> 01:04:59,968
The world changes,
we have to adapt.

1405
01:05:00,006 --> 01:05:01,871
These violent old ways

1406
01:05:01,908 --> 01:05:03,671
don't make
any sense anymore.

1407
01:05:03,710 --> 01:05:05,974
But she won't listen.

1408
01:05:06,012 --> 01:05:09,448
- She's insane.
- Oh, tell me about it.

1409
01:05:11,684 --> 01:05:14,050
Tepish, is there
anything like a...

1410
01:05:14,087 --> 01:05:15,918
Sanguine's doctor?

1411
01:05:15,955 --> 01:05:17,513
Stacy is sick.

1412
01:05:17,557 --> 01:05:19,286
That's impossible.
We don't get sick.

1413
01:05:19,325 --> 01:05:22,817
That's what I thought, but every night
when we get up, she vomits.

1414
01:05:22,862 --> 01:05:25,797
Just how old was she
when she was awakened?

1415
01:05:25,832 --> 01:05:27,322
20.

1416
01:05:27,367 --> 01:05:29,096
And I assume
there is a boyfriend.

1417
01:05:29,135 --> 01:05:30,796
- Why?
(chuckles)

1418
01:05:30,837 --> 01:05:32,862
She's not sick.
She's pregnant.

1419
01:05:32,906 --> 01:05:35,033
So she can have a baby?

1420
01:05:35,074 --> 01:05:38,009
No, the pregnancy
will end by itself.

1421
01:05:38,044 --> 01:05:40,035
Unless she turns back.

1422
01:05:40,079 --> 01:05:42,343
Like, if Cisserus dies?

1423
01:05:42,382 --> 01:05:44,942
(groans)
Cisserus.

1424
01:05:44,984 --> 01:05:47,646
Don't you worry, hmm?

1425
01:05:47,687 --> 01:05:50,781
Stacy will be just fine
in about a week.

1426
01:05:52,025 --> 01:05:54,323
They notified us
about a patient having seizures

1427
01:05:54,360 --> 01:05:56,590
who had a double puncture wound.
When I asked who checked him in,

1428
01:05:56,629 --> 01:05:58,790
I went back to
their surveillance cameras.

1429
01:05:58,832 --> 01:06:00,663
- Where's the body?
- Mount Sinai.

1430
01:06:00,700 --> 01:06:03,225
- Tell them we're coming.
- Mm-hmm.

1431
01:06:03,269 --> 01:06:07,296
All right,
sit down, listen to me.

1432
01:06:08,541 --> 01:06:10,202
Now, I know
you think I'm crazy,

1433
01:06:10,243 --> 01:06:13,076
but you have to do
something for me.

1434
01:06:13,112 --> 01:06:14,238
Sure.

1435
01:06:14,280 --> 01:06:16,271
Carry this with you
at all times.

1436
01:06:16,316 --> 01:06:19,285
- What?
- This is how you load it.

1437
01:06:19,319 --> 01:06:21,310
Only use the silver bullets.

1438
01:06:21,354 --> 01:06:23,219
Only use them on what?
Stacy?

1439
01:06:23,256 --> 01:06:25,053
Just keep it with you.

1440
01:06:25,091 --> 01:06:27,355
Don't give me any shit.

1441
01:06:27,393 --> 01:06:31,625
When a problem comes along,
like hunger, you must whip it.

1442
01:06:31,664 --> 01:06:34,497
It says this guy's a comic?
He's not even funny.

1443
01:06:34,534 --> 01:06:36,126
I've never seen him
in anything.

1444
01:06:36,169 --> 01:06:37,796
What's on?

1445
01:06:37,837 --> 01:06:40,135
"Assholes Insult People
More Talented Than Them."

1446
01:06:40,173 --> 01:06:43,472
"The Excessively '80s
Countdown."

1447
01:06:43,510 --> 01:06:44,943
Oh, show Goody.

1448
01:06:44,978 --> 01:06:46,377
Oh.

1449
01:06:46,412 --> 01:06:50,178
So my father decided
to give me this.

1450
01:06:50,216 --> 01:06:51,774
Hmm.
That's weird.

1451
01:06:51,818 --> 01:06:53,149
Oh, careful.
It's got silver bullets in it.

1452
01:06:53,186 --> 01:06:54,881
(gasps)

1453
01:06:54,921 --> 01:06:57,151
Stacy:
What's he thinking?

1454
01:06:57,190 --> 01:06:59,090
He's got more paranoid

1455
01:06:59,125 --> 01:07:00,683
since he saw the footage
from the hospital.

1456
01:07:00,727 --> 01:07:02,592
What footage?

1457
01:07:02,629 --> 01:07:05,655
This guy just seemed to fly
from a cab to the front door.

1458
01:07:05,698 --> 01:07:07,188
I'm such an idiot.

1459
01:07:07,233 --> 01:07:09,599
Why didn't I look
for surveillance cameras?

1460
01:07:09,636 --> 01:07:11,604
- Wait a minute, you...
- No, no. We didn't do anything.

1461
01:07:11,638 --> 01:07:14,368
It was...
it was our stem, Cisserus.

1462
01:07:14,407 --> 01:07:16,637
She's a monster.

1463
01:07:16,676 --> 01:07:18,735
She's gonna louse it up
for all of us.

1464
01:07:18,778 --> 01:07:21,246
Don't trip.
We'll talk to Tepish.

1465
01:07:21,281 --> 01:07:23,715
Oh, I saw him after work

1466
01:07:23,750 --> 01:07:25,615
and he said
you'll be feeling better soon.

1467
01:07:25,652 --> 01:07:27,142
You're just pregnant.

1468
01:07:27,186 --> 01:07:29,916
(laughing)
- What?

1469
01:07:29,956 --> 01:07:32,015
- I'm pregnant?
- We're gonna have a baby.

1470
01:07:32,058 --> 01:07:33,753
I'm pregnant!

1471
01:07:33,793 --> 01:07:35,522
Stacy:
Oh, my God!

1472
01:07:35,562 --> 01:07:37,291
Oh, I can't believe this.
I'm pregnant?

1473
01:07:37,330 --> 01:07:39,025
You want a baby?

1474
01:07:39,065 --> 01:07:40,896
Well...

1475
01:07:40,934 --> 01:07:43,232
yeah.

1476
01:07:43,269 --> 01:07:45,737
I'm over 40. How many more
chances am I gonna get?

1477
01:07:45,772 --> 01:07:47,262
And besides,
I'll make a kick-ass father.

1478
01:07:47,307 --> 01:07:48,831
(door opens, closes)
Renfield: - All right.

1479
01:07:48,875 --> 01:07:51,173
Forget cell phones,
forget iPhones,

1480
01:07:51,210 --> 01:07:53,974
forget PowerBooks,
forget iPads.

1481
01:07:54,013 --> 01:07:55,480
Goody:
Yay.

1482
01:07:55,515 --> 01:07:58,313
Now I can do
everything I want

1483
01:07:58,351 --> 01:08:00,216
with my iPad Mini.

1484
01:08:00,253 --> 01:08:01,845
That looks just like your phone.

1485
01:08:01,888 --> 01:08:03,651
But it doesn't make calls.

1486
01:08:03,690 --> 01:08:05,590
I got my tweets,
I got my e-mails,

1487
01:08:05,625 --> 01:08:07,217
I got my friends,
I got my alerts, I got...

1488
01:08:07,260 --> 01:08:09,160
So as the day progresses,
you can read

1489
01:08:09,195 --> 01:08:11,561
thousands
of unsolicited messages,

1490
01:08:11,598 --> 01:08:15,500
advertisements, and the mindless
brain vomit of acquaintances?

1491
01:08:15,535 --> 01:08:17,400
Someone sounds hormonal.

1492
01:08:17,437 --> 01:08:18,961
Maybe you're pregnant, too!

1493
01:08:19,005 --> 01:08:20,939
(groans)
So annoying.

1494
01:08:20,974 --> 01:08:23,636
You have to keep
learning to use new crap

1495
01:08:23,676 --> 01:08:25,303
that doesn't actually
do anything better

1496
01:08:25,345 --> 01:08:27,813
than the old crap, which is
incompatible with the new crap,

1497
01:08:27,847 --> 01:08:30,680
all so you can have blogs
and watch fake teenagers

1498
01:08:30,717 --> 01:08:32,378
and real housewives?

1499
01:08:32,418 --> 01:08:35,285
And it's all happening
too fast

1500
01:08:35,321 --> 01:08:37,152
and I'm tired.

1501
01:08:37,190 --> 01:08:41,149
I'm just sick
and tired of it all.

1502
01:08:41,194 --> 01:08:43,822
Stacy:
It's okay.

1503
01:08:43,863 --> 01:08:45,854
We don't have to get
the iPad Minis.

1504
01:08:49,769 --> 01:08:51,168
No, I'm sorry...

1505
01:08:51,204 --> 01:08:53,934
Look. Only a couple stations,
but they had Groucho Marx.

1506
01:08:53,973 --> 01:08:55,964
No, that's not Groucho.

1507
01:08:56,009 --> 01:08:57,499
Groucho was
the mustache guy.

1508
01:08:57,543 --> 01:08:59,101
Joey:
Yeah, he had glasses and a cigar.

1509
01:08:59,145 --> 01:09:01,045
Renfield:
Yeah, a cigar and glasses.

1510
01:09:01,080 --> 01:09:02,877
You'll split $25 between you.
Are you ready?

1511
01:09:02,915 --> 01:09:04,678
- Yes.
- Who is buried in Grant's Tomb?

1512
01:09:04,717 --> 01:09:06,344
Were people
really that stupid?

1513
01:09:06,386 --> 01:09:08,650
No, that's what he'd ask
when he felt bad

1514
01:09:08,688 --> 01:09:10,280
and wanted to give 'em
a few bucks.

1515
01:09:10,323 --> 01:09:11,984
Is Grant's Tomb
in New York?

1516
01:09:12,025 --> 01:09:14,084
- No. No.
- Yeah. Yeah.

1517
01:09:14,127 --> 01:09:15,651
Have any of you
ever been there?

1518
01:09:15,695 --> 01:09:17,629
- No.
- No.

1519
01:09:17,664 --> 01:09:20,497
- That's it.
Stacy: - What?

1520
01:09:20,533 --> 01:09:24,299
God, the place
no New Yorker ever goes.

1521
01:09:24,337 --> 01:09:26,601
Of course, Cisserus would
want a monument.

1522
01:09:26,639 --> 01:09:28,197
And it's gota tomb

1523
01:09:28,241 --> 01:09:30,038
Oh, my God.
You're probably right.

1524
01:09:30,076 --> 01:09:31,543
Come on.

1525
01:09:34,414 --> 01:09:36,006
- Show me again.
- Yeah, here.

1526
01:09:36,049 --> 01:09:38,415
I guess I totally can tell,
but it's...

1527
01:09:38,451 --> 01:09:40,078
it's like, I don't know.
I always thought you'd be

1528
01:09:40,119 --> 01:09:41,848
the first one to have a baby.
Is that weird?

1529
01:09:41,888 --> 01:09:43,378
- But now that it's happening...
- Listen.

1530
01:09:43,423 --> 01:09:46,551
You have to decide something
independent of me or Joey.

1531
01:09:46,592 --> 01:09:49,857
This baby won't survive
in your condition.

1532
01:09:49,896 --> 01:09:52,262
If you want it,
you have to turn back.

1533
01:09:52,298 --> 01:09:53,822
How does that even...

1534
01:09:53,866 --> 01:09:55,527
Cisserus would have
to be killed.

1535
01:09:55,568 --> 01:09:57,092
That's right.

1536
01:09:57,136 --> 01:10:00,264
I'd be in my '40s.

1537
01:10:00,306 --> 01:10:01,796
But I'd be a mom.

1538
01:10:03,543 --> 01:10:06,944
- You'd be older, too.
- I know.

1539
01:10:06,979 --> 01:10:08,503
I can't decide
for the both of us.

1540
01:10:08,548 --> 01:10:12,211
How do you feel about
not being young anymore?

1541
01:10:12,251 --> 01:10:13,741
Which part...

1542
01:10:13,786 --> 01:10:16,584
running around to clubs
and dating idiots?

1543
01:10:16,622 --> 01:10:19,557
Would be nice not to
have to fake all the references.

1544
01:10:19,592 --> 01:10:21,184
- Ugh.
- Like acting nostalgic over

1545
01:10:21,227 --> 01:10:23,559
"Hey, Arnold" instead of
"Happy Days."

1546
01:10:23,596 --> 01:10:25,962
Not to mention
the slang, "BTW."

1547
01:10:25,998 --> 01:10:27,659
And the clothes
and the music.

1548
01:10:27,700 --> 01:10:30,498
Staying young is getting old.

1549
01:10:30,536 --> 01:10:33,699
Plus, we'll have a baby.

1550
01:10:35,842 --> 01:10:38,606
What are we even talking about?
We can't kill Cisserus.

1551
01:10:38,644 --> 01:10:40,441
She's lasted hundreds of years.

1552
01:10:40,480 --> 01:10:42,744
But that's because
nobody knew where she was.

1553
01:10:42,782 --> 01:10:44,010
But she's very sturdy.

1554
01:10:44,050 --> 01:10:46,348
And let's face it,
we're wimps.

1555
01:10:46,385 --> 01:10:49,786
Yeah, but she's sloppy.
And conceited.

1556
01:10:49,822 --> 01:10:51,289
And we'll call in
the heavy-hitters.

1557
01:10:51,324 --> 01:10:52,689
Who?

1558
01:10:52,725 --> 01:10:54,852
Your future father-in-law.

1559
01:10:54,894 --> 01:10:57,158
(laughs)

1560
01:10:57,196 --> 01:11:00,098
I just have to do
one thing first.

1561
01:11:00,099 --> 01:11:02,363
You said for a little more time,
you'd do anything.

1562
01:11:02,401 --> 01:11:04,926
- Did you mean it?
- Of course, but what can I do?

1563
01:11:04,971 --> 01:11:06,939
Would you change your schedule
and stay up later

1564
01:11:06,973 --> 01:11:09,237
and promise to let her
only have animals?

1565
01:11:09,275 --> 01:11:12,005
Now, wait a minute.
Can you keep her alive?

1566
01:11:12,044 --> 01:11:15,343
- Not exactly alive.
- But not dead?

1567
01:11:15,381 --> 01:11:17,906
I can't but he can.

1568
01:11:17,950 --> 01:11:20,111
- It's up to you.
- Yeah.

1569
01:11:20,153 --> 01:11:22,451
Yeah, I can't lose her.

1570
01:11:26,292 --> 01:11:29,125
I need privacy to do this.

1571
01:11:32,265 --> 01:11:34,699

That's enough.
It doesn't take that long.

1589
01:12:49,075 --> 01:12:51,168
(growls)

1590
01:12:59,585 --> 01:13:01,416
Your wife is very sweet.

1591
01:13:03,456 --> 01:13:06,118
- Yeah.
- So, uh...

1592
01:13:06,158 --> 01:13:08,217
I am just wondering,

1593
01:13:08,261 --> 01:13:10,923
are you guys
getting along, or, uh...

1594
01:13:10,963 --> 01:13:13,557
any chance of breaking up
in the future?

1595
01:13:16,969 --> 01:13:18,459
Danny.

1596
01:13:25,945 --> 01:13:27,606
Thank you.

1597
01:13:27,647 --> 01:13:29,877
You're welcome.

1598
01:13:38,157 --> 01:13:41,126
(knock on door)
Goody: - Come on, open up.

1599
01:13:41,160 --> 01:13:43,185
- Who's there?
- I'm a friend of your son.

1600
01:13:43,229 --> 01:13:46,221
- I wanna help you.
- You want to help me?

1601
01:13:46,265 --> 01:13:49,029
I've got some news
for you, Grandpa.

1602
01:13:54,073 --> 01:13:55,768
Did you say Grandpa?

1603
01:13:57,276 --> 01:13:59,801
(music playing)

1604
01:14:01,013 --> 01:14:04,505
I thought all victims
turned into vampires or died.

1605
01:14:04,550 --> 01:14:07,041
I've never heard of anyone
turning back.

1606
01:14:07,086 --> 01:14:08,883
Well, I've never known
anyone firsthand.

1607
01:14:08,921 --> 01:14:11,617
But apparently,
if you're young enough...

1608
01:14:11,657 --> 01:14:13,420
those are useless on a stem.

1609
01:14:16,529 --> 01:14:20,829
Are you really sure this isn't just
Joey's rebelliousness?

1610
01:14:20,866 --> 01:14:23,630
I mean,
do they seem serious?

1611
01:14:23,669 --> 01:14:26,263
Well, I've never seen Stacy
like this before.

1612
01:14:26,305 --> 01:14:28,364
And he's so excited
to be a dad.

1613
01:14:28,407 --> 01:14:31,137
I believe
they really are in love.

1614
01:14:31,177 --> 01:14:33,077
When did you awaken?

1615
01:14:33,112 --> 01:14:34,739
1841.

1616
01:14:34,780 --> 01:14:37,078
I survived a feeding
and begged her to turn me.

1617
01:14:37,116 --> 01:14:39,209
You wanted
to become a vampire?

1618
01:14:39,251 --> 01:14:41,981
It was the lesser
of two infections.

1619
01:14:42,021 --> 01:14:44,455
In 1840, there was
an epidemic of cholera

1620
01:14:44,490 --> 01:14:45,980
in lower Manhattan.

1621
01:14:46,025 --> 01:14:49,051
It was a painful
and degrading death.

1622
01:14:49,095 --> 01:14:51,757
My husband and sisters
had all passed.

1623
01:14:51,797 --> 01:14:55,062
But, miraculously,
my children were fine.

1624
01:14:55,101 --> 01:14:58,969
Not to be indelicate,
but I had digestive rumblings

1625
01:14:59,005 --> 01:15:00,768
that I knew were
the early symptoms,

1626
01:15:00,806 --> 01:15:03,673
and orphans did not fare well
in those days.

1627
01:15:03,709 --> 01:15:05,734
So did your kids survive?

1628
01:15:05,778 --> 01:15:09,771
My son lived
to the ripe old age of 63.

1629
01:15:09,815 --> 01:15:12,409
And my daughter
married Peter Meester,

1630
01:15:12,451 --> 01:15:14,612
and lived to be 99.

1631
01:15:14,653 --> 01:15:16,644
Unprecedented at the time.

1632
01:15:16,689 --> 01:15:19,283
Well, not many elderly people
had strong young mothers

1633
01:15:19,325 --> 01:15:20,815
to look out for them.

1634
01:15:22,428 --> 01:15:24,726
After the grandchildren,
it would've been hard

1635
01:15:24,764 --> 01:15:26,789
to stay in their lives
and not scare them.

1636
01:15:28,334 --> 01:15:29,528
(intercom clicks)

1637
01:15:29,568 --> 01:15:31,832
- Did you get that?
Rita: - Got it.

1638
01:15:31,871 --> 01:15:35,637
You know, the only surefire
way is to behead her.

1639
01:15:35,674 --> 01:15:39,405
Everything else might
just piss her off.

1640
01:15:39,445 --> 01:15:41,379
And when Cisserus is dead,

1641
01:15:41,414 --> 01:15:44,247
Stacy will be a normal girl.

1642
01:15:44,283 --> 01:15:47,218
Normal for Stacy.

1643
01:15:47,253 --> 01:15:50,586
But, what happens
to you, then?

1644
01:15:52,024 --> 01:15:54,288
I saved my kids.

1645
01:15:54,326 --> 01:15:55,850
Let's go save yours.

1646
01:15:57,430 --> 01:15:59,523
Here you go.
Here's your family tree.

1647
01:16:02,034 --> 01:16:03,831
Your living descendants.

1648
01:16:03,869 --> 01:16:07,168
A great-great-great-great grandson.

1649
01:16:07,206 --> 01:16:10,539
A drug addict.
Incarcerated.

1650
01:16:10,576 --> 01:16:15,309
Four doctors.
One in Doctors Without Borders.

1651
01:16:15,347 --> 01:16:17,781
Two professors,
four teachers,

1652
01:16:17,817 --> 01:16:19,808
and in the House
of Representatives,

1653
01:16:19,852 --> 01:16:22,787
Jane Rutherford,
who chairs several committees.

1654
01:16:22,822 --> 01:16:24,449
She looks like you.

1655
01:16:26,158 --> 01:16:27,648
Thank you.

1656
01:16:28,661 --> 01:16:31,289
All right,
leave the guns.

1657
01:16:31,330 --> 01:16:34,265
Bring the axes,
hatchets, blades.

1658
01:16:34,300 --> 01:16:38,134
All right, let's go get
this dried up bitch.

1659
01:16:40,272 --> 01:16:42,365
Well, I don't go
to those places much, either.

1660
01:16:42,408 --> 01:16:45,468
But it just shows you can meet
someone really nice.

1661
01:16:45,511 --> 01:16:48,002
Well, I never go
to those places, so...

1662
01:16:48,047 --> 01:16:49,947
I can't believe
I met you, though.

1663
01:16:49,982 --> 01:16:52,883
- You are beautiful.
- You're so sweet.

1664
01:16:52,918 --> 01:16:54,408
(laughs)

1665
01:16:54,453 --> 01:16:57,320
- Would you like to sit?
- Oh, would I?

1666
01:16:59,191 --> 01:17:02,183
- Nice here.
- Isn't it?

1667
01:17:02,228 --> 01:17:04,526
Oh.

1668
01:17:04,563 --> 01:17:06,724
Isn't your wife
worried about

1669
01:17:06,765 --> 01:17:08,665
where you are so late?

1670
01:17:08,701 --> 01:17:11,898
She's on a trip and what she
don't know won't hurt her.

1671
01:17:14,306 --> 01:17:16,501
Aren't you a bad boy?

1672
01:17:16,542 --> 01:17:18,976
I can be very bad.

1673
01:17:19,011 --> 01:17:22,469
So what does a dirty boy
like you do for a living?

1674
01:17:22,515 --> 01:17:24,312
I'm a dentist.

1675
01:17:24,350 --> 01:17:27,012
You're a dentist?

1676
01:17:27,052 --> 01:17:29,020
What a lucky break.

1677
01:17:29,054 --> 01:17:31,284
Because I have something
I'm really concerned about.

1678
01:17:31,323 --> 01:17:33,086
Can I show you?

1679
01:17:36,929 --> 01:17:40,695
I've never seen anything
like that in my...

1680
01:17:40,733 --> 01:17:43,702
(growling)
- Oh, no! No!

1681
01:17:43,736 --> 01:17:45,636
(screaming)

1682
01:17:47,573 --> 01:17:49,734
Run!
Get out of here!

1683
01:17:53,012 --> 01:17:54,741
You asshole.

1684
01:17:54,780 --> 01:17:56,509
Let's go.

1685
01:18:04,256 --> 01:18:05,553
(grunts)

1686
01:18:05,591 --> 01:18:07,388
You bad girls.

1687
01:18:07,426 --> 01:18:09,986
I am very
disappointed in you.

1688
01:18:10,029 --> 01:18:12,589
After all
I've done for you,

1689
01:18:12,631 --> 01:18:15,623
this is how you pay me back?

1690
01:18:15,668 --> 01:18:16,828
(screams)

1691
01:18:16,869 --> 01:18:19,030
(girls scream)
Goody: - Are you okay?

1692
01:18:19,071 --> 01:18:21,130
Who treats
their stem like this?

1693
01:18:24,376 --> 01:18:26,776
(clicks)
(Van Helsing laughs)

1694
01:18:26,812 --> 01:18:28,780
Those needed gunpowder!

1695
01:18:32,218 --> 01:18:34,243
(growling)

1696
01:18:34,286 --> 01:18:35,583
(groaning)

1697
01:18:38,324 --> 01:18:40,258
Joey: Duck!

1698
01:18:40,292 --> 01:18:42,624
(screaming)

1699
01:18:45,598 --> 01:18:47,065
Oh, my God.
We did it.

1700
01:18:47,099 --> 01:18:50,068
No. You guys, we have
to get her into the tomb.

1701
01:18:50,102 --> 01:18:51,501
- Help me.
- Okay, okay.

1702
01:18:51,537 --> 01:18:54,267
Argh.

1703
01:18:54,306 --> 01:18:56,467
When did my ass
get so flat?

1704
01:19:00,379 --> 01:19:02,574
Can I just say... ow!

1705
01:19:06,719 --> 01:19:08,209
Wait... what are we gonna do
about the body?

1706
01:19:08,254 --> 01:19:09,585
Oh, it'll die in a minute.

1707
01:19:09,622 --> 01:19:11,021
Where were you?

1708
01:19:11,056 --> 01:19:12,853
What? You asked me
to get a chainsaw.

1709
01:19:12,891 --> 01:19:14,882
I get halfway here
and realize it needs gasoline.

1710
01:19:14,927 --> 01:19:17,327
Do you know where to get gasoline
at 4:00 in the morning?

1711
01:19:17,363 --> 01:19:18,921
Why didn't you get it
where you got the saw?

1712
01:19:18,964 --> 01:19:20,659
Because I thought
you plugged them in.

1713
01:19:20,699 --> 01:19:21,927
What am I, a lumberjack?

1714
01:19:21,967 --> 01:19:24,231
In the forest,
you're plugging things in?

1715
01:19:24,270 --> 01:19:26,670
- Yes, like a hairdryer or a...

- Okay, let's go.

1725
01:20:04,843 --> 01:20:06,435
You feel anything?

1726
01:20:06,478 --> 01:20:07,809
No.

1727

You've aged 20 years?

1731
01:20:29,735 --> 01:20:32,670
Well, I didn't drink, smoke,
do drugs, or sunbathe.

1732

(laughs)

1733
01:20:39,578 --> 01:20:43,241
Oh, well, maybe your genes
just aren't as good.

1734
01:20:43,282 --> 01:20:45,716
But with Botox
and laser resurfacing...

1735
01:20:49,154 --> 01:20:51,281
Don't tell me you lied
about your age.

1736
01:20:51,323 --> 01:20:52,756
Oh, come on.

1737

It's okay.

1740
01:21:02,034 --> 01:21:04,059
I've been around
long enough.

1741
01:21:04,103 --> 01:21:05,730
I'm tired.

1742
01:21:06,939 --> 01:21:08,770
I should've known.

1743
01:21:08,807 --> 01:21:10,741
Every time I turned on
the History Channel,

1744
01:21:10,776 --> 01:21:12,767
all I saw was stuff
about Hitler.

1745
01:21:14,179 --> 01:21:17,148
Don't be sad. I was gonna go
into the sun before I met you.

1746
01:21:17,182 --> 01:21:19,275
You showed me
how to have fun.

1747
01:21:27,559 --> 01:21:29,288
Is there anything you want?

1748
01:21:29,328 --> 01:21:30,727
Yes.

1749
01:21:30,763 --> 01:21:32,628
I don't wanna be here.

1750

1753
01:22:02,194 --> 01:22:05,595
You all right?
How do you feel?

1754
01:22:05,631 --> 01:22:07,394
Hungry.

1755
01:22:07,433 --> 01:22:10,334
How about one of those
pretzel things?

1756
01:22:10,369 --> 01:22:12,098
Joey, can you go get
one of those pretzel things?

1757
01:22:12,137 --> 01:22:13,968
