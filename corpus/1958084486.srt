1
00:00:13,103 --> 00:00:17,413
No, no, I'm
telling you, something is off.

2
00:00:17,482 --> 00:00:21,275
Yeah, I-I've been over these
numbers a thousand times.

3
00:00:21,310 --> 00:00:23,586
I didn't authorize
these transactions.

4
00:00:29,137 --> 00:00:31,448
Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.

5
00:00:32,965 --> 00:00:35,448
Listen...

6
00:00:35,482 --> 00:00:39,068
Call a meeting in the morning.
I want everyone there.

7
00:00:39,137 --> 00:00:40,827
I think I know
who's behind this.

8
00:01:21,862 --> 00:01:27,034
I, Richard Washington,
being of sound mind and body...

9
00:01:27,137 --> 00:01:30,862
not acting under duress
or any influence,

10
00:01:30,965 --> 00:01:34,000
hereby make, publish and declare

11
00:01:34,034 --> 00:01:37,724
this document, my last will
and testament.

12
00:01:37,758 --> 00:01:41,344
And hereby revoke any and all
wills heretofore

13
00:01:41,379 --> 00:01:43,103
made by me.

14
00:01:43,206 --> 00:01:46,137
I hereby bequeath the
entirety of all my property,

15
00:01:46,206 --> 00:01:47,413
both real and personal,

16
00:01:47,517 --> 00:01:48,957
including all shares
and interests of

17
00:01:49,034 --> 00:01:51,827
Washington Incorporated
to my last living relative,

18
00:01:51,862 --> 00:01:54,241
my brother's daughter,
Anna Washington.

19
00:01:54,344 --> 00:01:55,965
- I should have known.
- What the hell!

20
00:01:56,034 --> 00:01:58,551
- Who is Anna?
- So, what does this mean?

21
00:01:58,655 --> 00:02:00,551
You know exactly
what this means.

22
00:02:00,655 --> 00:02:02,724
- Means we have a new boss.
- Like hell we do.

23
00:02:02,793 --> 00:02:04,275
I've poured my soul
into this company

24
00:02:04,379 --> 00:02:07,068
and I'll be damned if I let some
greenhorn come and take it over.

25
00:02:07,103 --> 00:02:08,586
James, let's talk about this...

26
00:02:08,620 --> 00:02:10,448
Janet, there's nothing
left to talk about.

27
00:02:10,551 --> 00:02:12,241
Brian, you get this
overruled immediately.

28
00:02:12,275 --> 00:02:14,000
I don't care what
you have to do.

29
00:02:14,103 --> 00:02:16,413
I can't. He listed me
as the executor of the estate.

30
00:02:16,448 --> 00:02:17,896
It's a conflict of interest.

31
00:02:17,931 --> 00:02:19,103
Then find someone else.

32
00:02:19,206 --> 00:02:22,137
Who the hell is Anna?

33
00:02:33,275 --> 00:02:36,827
And this is our final piece,

34
00:02:36,931 --> 00:02:39,275
titled Facing Future,
from the Heartstring collection

35
00:02:39,379 --> 00:02:40,931
by Pamela Celestine,

36
00:02:40,965 --> 00:02:42,379
my former art teacher.

37
00:02:42,448 --> 00:02:44,275
She inspired me
to become an artist.

38
00:02:44,379 --> 00:02:46,931
This piece along with all of the
other work you've seen today,

39
00:02:46,965 --> 00:02:49,137
including some of
my original work,

40
00:02:49,241 --> 00:02:51,586
is available for purchase
by digital download.

41
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:54,620
Just scan the QR code
under any piece in the gallery.

42
00:02:54,724 --> 00:02:57,793
And that concludes
our digital exhibition.

43
00:03:00,413 --> 00:03:02,862
Oh, and before you go,

44
00:03:02,896 --> 00:03:05,000
just please remember,
all contributions help

45
00:03:05,103 --> 00:03:06,931
keep this gallery in operation!

46
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,586
Thanks for coming.

47
00:03:28,137 --> 00:03:30,310
Hey, girl. Sorry I'm late.

48
00:03:31,758 --> 00:03:33,103
Where's everybody at?

49
00:03:33,172 --> 00:03:35,965
They're gone.
The exhibition just ended.

50
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,034
- They buy anything?
- Not this time.

51
00:03:38,137 --> 00:03:39,517
Damn!

52
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:41,689
Why did I spend all this money
on refreshments?

53
00:03:41,793 --> 00:03:43,206
I know.

54
00:03:43,241 --> 00:03:44,976
Thank you for grabbing those.
I promise I'll pay you back.

55
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,517
Don't worry about it,
tax write off.

56
00:03:49,758 --> 00:03:52,517
- Another notice?
- Thirty days.

57
00:03:52,551 --> 00:03:54,113
Kendra, I'm gonna have
to sell this gallery,

58
00:03:54,137 --> 00:03:55,689
I can't afford to keep it open.

59
00:03:55,724 --> 00:03:59,172
Anna, I told you stop doing
this donations at the door crap

60
00:03:59,206 --> 00:04:00,724
and start charging an admission.

61
00:04:00,758 --> 00:04:03,241
This ain't community theater!

62
00:04:03,275 --> 00:04:04,448
What you need to do

63
00:04:04,551 --> 00:04:06,517
is set up some strobe lights,
a pole,

64
00:04:06,586 --> 00:04:08,586
then let ya girl show off
these dance moves,

65
00:04:08,689 --> 00:04:10,586
that, or we need to
set up an OnlyFans

66
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:11,872
for you and them
pretty ass feet!

67
00:04:11,896 --> 00:04:13,517
- No.
- That's your money maker.

68
00:04:13,551 --> 00:04:14,931
Hell, no!

69
00:04:18,241 --> 00:04:19,689
Hey.

70
00:04:19,758 --> 00:04:22,413
I had a few meetings
with some high rollers

71
00:04:22,448 --> 00:04:23,793
who want to sponsor the gallery.

72
00:04:23,896 --> 00:04:25,896
All we have to do
are two Instagram posts...

73
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,655
No, no.

74
00:04:27,724 --> 00:04:29,206
I told you, I'm not interested...

75
00:04:29,241 --> 00:04:30,758
Anna, these corporations

76
00:04:30,793 --> 00:04:32,473
are all about looking good
on social media,

77
00:04:32,517 --> 00:04:33,931
and what better way

78
00:04:33,965 --> 00:04:36,551
than to sponsor a
thriving black-owned business?

79
00:04:36,586 --> 00:04:39,103
You better take
these white guilt checks!

80
00:04:39,206 --> 00:04:42,034
Kendra, look around.

81
00:04:42,068 --> 00:04:44,172
What is thriving here?

82
00:04:44,241 --> 00:04:46,551
I don't want to get in bed
with big business.

83
00:04:46,586 --> 00:04:47,906
Yes, I want to be
taken seriously,

84
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,241
as an artist and
an entrepreneur, but

85
00:04:50,344 --> 00:04:51,862
I want to do it my way.

86
00:04:53,068 --> 00:04:54,413
You better act fast.

87
00:04:54,448 --> 00:04:56,068
Money doesn't just come
calling like...

88
00:04:59,413 --> 00:05:01,310
- Damn. Again?
- Who is it?

89
00:05:01,413 --> 00:05:04,275
I don't know, but it's the third
time today they've called me.

90
00:05:04,310 --> 00:05:05,310
That could be money.

91
00:05:05,344 --> 00:05:06,517
Or it could be a stalker.

92
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:08,620
- You ain't got no stalk...
- Hey.

93
00:05:08,655 --> 00:05:10,620
I've been called for worse.

94
00:05:10,655 --> 00:05:12,000
You gonna answer that?

95
00:05:12,103 --> 00:05:13,931
You're the one
that's been calling?

96
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,517
- You are Anna Washington?
- She is.

97
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:18,079
I have some sensitive
information I need

98
00:05:18,103 --> 00:05:19,827
to discuss with you.

99
00:05:19,931 --> 00:05:21,206
Alone.

100
00:05:24,034 --> 00:05:26,517
I don't know what
Richard was thinking.

101
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:28,172
He was thinking
about his legacy.

102
00:05:28,275 --> 00:05:30,172
And I think we should
give her a chance.

103
00:05:30,275 --> 00:05:32,482
You and I both know
we should be the ones

104
00:05:32,586 --> 00:05:34,448
deciding the future
of this company.

105
00:05:34,482 --> 00:05:35,965
Oh, so now it's we?

106
00:05:39,482 --> 00:05:41,758
- Yes, we.
- Oh!

107
00:05:41,827 --> 00:05:43,758
And why are you okay with him
giving this company

108
00:05:43,827 --> 00:05:45,965
to a family member
no one knew existed?

109
00:05:46,827 --> 00:05:49,068
I knew she existed,

110
00:05:49,137 --> 00:05:52,965
and maybe that's why he wanted
Anna to take his place.

111
00:05:53,068 --> 00:05:54,562
Since both he and
his brother are gone,

112
00:05:54,586 --> 00:05:56,344
it just feels right that...

113
00:05:56,448 --> 00:05:58,137
No, save it, Janet.

114
00:05:58,241 --> 00:06:00,310
Richard's brother was
tanking this company.

115
00:06:00,344 --> 00:06:02,551
And if Richard hadn't
let him go when he did,

116
00:06:02,655 --> 00:06:04,724
Washington Inc. would be
bankrupt right now.

117
00:06:04,827 --> 00:06:06,286
And if Anna is anything
like her father,

118
00:06:06,310 --> 00:06:08,413
you and I might find
ourselves in early retirement.

119
00:06:08,517 --> 00:06:12,551
James, she lost both of her
parents at a young age,

120
00:06:12,655 --> 00:06:14,379
and was left with nothing.

121
00:06:14,482 --> 00:06:18,448
And now she's lost her
last living relative.

122
00:06:23,310 --> 00:06:27,000
Bitch, you have a whole ass rich
uncle you never told me about?

123
00:06:28,827 --> 00:06:31,000
My uncle and I haven't
spoken in years.

124
00:06:31,068 --> 00:06:33,551
He and my father had a falling
out, and after my father died,

125
00:06:33,655 --> 00:06:35,862
we never reconnected. So,

126
00:06:35,896 --> 00:06:38,379
I pretty much didn't have
any family at all.

127
00:06:38,482 --> 00:06:39,689
Except you, friend.

128
00:06:39,724 --> 00:06:41,620
Aww. Girl.

129
00:06:43,172 --> 00:06:46,482
Me and you, step apart.

130
00:06:46,551 --> 00:06:48,424
Okay, girl, this is cute
and all, but let's talk about

131
00:06:48,448 --> 00:06:49,724
this payday!

132
00:06:49,827 --> 00:06:52,034
This is next level!

133
00:06:52,068 --> 00:06:53,896
I thought this only
happened in movies!

134
00:06:53,931 --> 00:06:56,793
See, this is why your ass needs
to be answering your phone!

135
00:06:56,862 --> 00:06:58,344
I told you it was money calling!

136
00:06:58,379 --> 00:07:01,034
Maybe I can speak me up
a damn sugar daddy...

137
00:07:01,068 --> 00:07:04,689
- Of course, I do wish you could.
- Listen, I am alive.

138
00:07:04,758 --> 00:07:06,206
Thank you.

139
00:07:12,379 --> 00:07:13,896
Mhm-hm.

140
00:07:16,448 --> 00:07:17,931
I got you... this time.

141
00:07:17,965 --> 00:07:20,137
But you can pay me back
when you get paid.

142
00:07:20,172 --> 00:07:23,482
Speaking of, you are going
to accept everything, right?

143
00:07:23,586 --> 00:07:25,103
I'm still thinking about it.

144
00:07:25,137 --> 00:07:26,793
What's there to think about,
Anna?

145
00:07:26,827 --> 00:07:28,931
It's not just the money
and the house,

146
00:07:29,034 --> 00:07:30,562
he's leaving me the
controlling interest of

147
00:07:30,586 --> 00:07:32,251
one of the biggest tech
companies in the country.

148
00:07:32,275 --> 00:07:34,182
I don't know if I'm ready
for something like that.

149
00:07:34,206 --> 00:07:36,965
So just take the money, girl!
It ain't that deep.

150
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,241
When are you supposed to see
the attorney again?

151
00:07:39,275 --> 00:07:41,551
I'm supposed to meet Brian
at the mansion tomorrow.

152
00:07:41,586 --> 00:07:43,068
Perfect.

153
00:07:44,965 --> 00:07:47,620
Anna, I'm sure your uncle
still cared about you.

154
00:07:47,724 --> 00:07:50,758
Why else would he leave you
everything?

155
00:07:50,862 --> 00:07:52,448
I don't know.

156
00:07:52,551 --> 00:07:55,241
And why didn't he leave anything
for his business partners?

157
00:07:56,551 --> 00:07:58,068
I say let's find out.

158
00:08:00,275 --> 00:08:02,000
You coming with me?

159
00:08:14,137 --> 00:08:15,413
Ooh!

160
00:08:15,482 --> 00:08:17,275
Girl. We made it!

161
00:08:18,655 --> 00:08:20,344
- Wait.
- For what?

162
00:08:20,448 --> 00:08:22,310
A marching band? Come on.

163
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,827
Damn, hurry up.

164
00:08:37,862 --> 00:08:39,172
Well, hold on.

165
00:08:39,206 --> 00:08:40,931
We're here a bit early.
Let me call Brian

166
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,586
and make sure
he knows were here.

167
00:08:42,655 --> 00:08:44,931
Oh! Oooh, it's open.

168
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,379
- Come on.
- Kendra, wait.

169
00:08:46,482 --> 00:08:47,596
Kendra, stop. What are you...

170
00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:48,793
Brian?

171
00:08:48,827 --> 00:08:50,034
Maybe he's not here.

172
00:08:50,137 --> 00:08:52,275
- He knows we're coming, right?
- Yeah.

173
00:08:53,758 --> 00:08:56,827
Damn, this place is huge.

174
00:08:56,862 --> 00:08:58,689
Don't touch anything.

175
00:08:58,793 --> 00:09:01,068
Girl, shut up.

176
00:09:01,103 --> 00:09:03,310
Look. Come here.
Look at this.

177
00:09:05,241 --> 00:09:07,793
That's a 14th century porcelain.

178
00:09:07,896 --> 00:09:10,896
- It's... priceless.
- Priceless.

179
00:09:13,068 --> 00:09:15,413
- Careful.
- You need to cut that out.

180
00:09:15,448 --> 00:09:17,379
You're gonna mess around
and somebody's gonna

181
00:09:17,413 --> 00:09:18,482
shoot yo ass one day!

182
00:09:18,551 --> 00:09:20,758
My apologies, ladies.

183
00:09:20,862 --> 00:09:22,517
Let's talk inside the office.

184
00:09:22,551 --> 00:09:24,241
Let's.

185
00:09:24,275 --> 00:09:25,689
Girl...

186
00:09:25,758 --> 00:09:30,586
So, just sign here, and here
for the house and all assets.

187
00:09:30,689 --> 00:09:35,000
And sign here for your shares
of Washington Inc.

188
00:09:37,206 --> 00:09:38,976
If it's too much,
you can always sell your shares

189
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,586
to the remaining partners.

190
00:09:40,689 --> 00:09:43,172
Or designate an acting CEO
until you've made your decision.

191
00:09:43,241 --> 00:09:45,217
But she still keeps the house
and the money, right?

192
00:09:45,241 --> 00:09:46,424
Of course.
Once signed, we'll begin

193
00:09:46,448 --> 00:09:49,103
the transfer process
later this week.

194
00:09:49,137 --> 00:09:51,724
You better sign that paper
before I sign it for you.

195
00:10:00,758 --> 00:10:02,793
Ooh, bitch, we rich!

196
00:10:02,896 --> 00:10:06,482
Would you like to discuss the
transfer of shares now or later?

197
00:10:09,034 --> 00:10:12,862
Truthfully, I don't think
I'm fit to be a CEO, but...

198
00:10:12,931 --> 00:10:15,689
this is my family's legacy
and I don't want to just...

199
00:10:15,758 --> 00:10:18,275
give it away without giving it
some real consideration.

200
00:10:18,344 --> 00:10:19,758
Take all the time you need.

201
00:10:19,793 --> 00:10:21,827
Until then, you can expect
the funds to be wired

202
00:10:21,896 --> 00:10:23,344
within the next 72 hours.

203
00:10:23,413 --> 00:10:27,000
Congratulations, Ms. Washington.
You just secured a bag.

204
00:10:27,068 --> 00:10:29,137
Now, boy, who taught you that?

205
00:10:31,103 --> 00:10:35,000
By the way, Brian,
how did my uncle die?

206
00:10:35,068 --> 00:10:37,586
Let's see...

207
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:40,413
Ah, the county medical examiner
ruled it a heart attack.

208
00:10:40,448 --> 00:10:42,379
Possibly induced by an overdose.

209
00:10:42,448 --> 00:10:45,241
Actually, he died
in this very room.

210
00:10:47,310 --> 00:10:48,931
Damn!

211
00:10:49,034 --> 00:10:51,034
Oh. Good. You're still here.

212
00:10:51,103 --> 00:10:53,758
I hope you don't mind
I let myself in.

213
00:10:53,862 --> 00:10:57,172
Hi, Anna.
It has been a long time.

214
00:10:57,241 --> 00:10:59,275
I'm sorry. We've met?

215
00:10:59,379 --> 00:11:02,448
Well, we haven't seen each other
since you were a little girl,

216
00:11:02,517 --> 00:11:04,586
before your father passed away.

217
00:11:04,655 --> 00:11:07,896
I'm Janet, chief content officer
of Washington Inc.

218
00:11:07,965 --> 00:11:09,827
As I'm so sorry for your loss.

219
00:11:09,862 --> 00:11:12,413
If there's anything we can do
to make you more comfortable,

220
00:11:12,482 --> 00:11:14,344
don't hesitate to reach out.

221
00:11:14,413 --> 00:11:16,758
- Thank you, Janet.
- Yeah.

222
00:11:16,827 --> 00:11:20,172
I wanted to personally welcome
you to your new home

223
00:11:20,241 --> 00:11:22,275
and to your new position with

224
00:11:22,344 --> 00:11:25,068
at the company your uncle
and I worked hard to build.

225
00:11:25,137 --> 00:11:27,793
- And my father.
- Of course.

226
00:11:27,862 --> 00:11:30,862
And I haven't decided if
I'm taking the position or not.

227
00:11:30,931 --> 00:11:34,517
Well, in any case,
I think it'd be a good to

228
00:11:34,586 --> 00:11:36,148
acquaint you with the company
and its lenders

229
00:11:36,172 --> 00:11:39,000
so you can make
an informed decision.

230
00:11:39,103 --> 00:11:40,655
Actually, most of them will be

231
00:11:40,689 --> 00:11:42,482
at the Empowerment Event
this weekend,

232
00:11:42,517 --> 00:11:43,965
which you should
definitely attend.

233
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,310
What is that?

234
00:11:45,344 --> 00:11:47,103
It's an event your uncle
hosted every year.

235
00:11:47,172 --> 00:11:50,172
We do business updates,
scholarship giveaways.

236
00:11:50,275 --> 00:11:52,241
It's always a wonderful time.

237
00:11:52,310 --> 00:11:54,137
And this year,

238
00:11:54,172 --> 00:11:57,000
we will be honoring
Richard's memory.

239
00:11:57,068 --> 00:11:59,758
- Sounds beautiful.
- And fancy.

240
00:11:59,827 --> 00:12:01,206
It always is.

241
00:12:02,137 --> 00:12:03,689
You know what, actually,

242
00:12:03,758 --> 00:12:07,275
it would be lovely if
you spoke on Richard's behalf.

243
00:12:08,482 --> 00:12:11,103
Uh, I'll think about it.

244
00:12:12,689 --> 00:12:16,068
In the meantime, there's someone
here I'd like you to meet.

245
00:12:16,172 --> 00:12:17,827
Anna, this is Darren.

246
00:12:20,137 --> 00:12:22,413
Nice to meet you,
Ms. Washington.

247
00:12:22,517 --> 00:12:24,310
Please, call me Anna.

248
00:12:24,379 --> 00:12:28,551
Darren was Richard's assistant
and house manager.

249
00:12:28,655 --> 00:12:30,172
Now... he's yours.

250
00:12:31,862 --> 00:12:33,862
Hey. I'm Kendra. Hi.

251
00:12:33,896 --> 00:12:36,517
Ooh, you work out, don't you?

252
00:12:36,586 --> 00:12:40,344
Okay, so, Darren,
you wouldn't mind

253
00:12:40,413 --> 00:12:42,586
showing these ladies
around and make sure

254
00:12:42,689 --> 00:12:44,379
Anna has everything she needs
to be ready

255
00:12:44,413 --> 00:12:46,482
to board meeting next week.

256
00:12:47,862 --> 00:12:50,000
Anna, it was a pleasure
seeing you again.

257
00:12:50,068 --> 00:12:51,689
- Welcome.
- Thank you.

258
00:12:56,689 --> 00:12:58,379
Hi. I'm still here.

259
00:12:58,413 --> 00:12:59,689
Now that everyone has met,

260
00:12:59,758 --> 00:13:01,965
I'll leave you ladies in
Darren's hands.

261
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,862
I'd love to take you on a tour
of the house, if you'd like?

262
00:13:04,931 --> 00:13:07,862
Why, yes, we'd absolutely
love that.

263
00:13:09,379 --> 00:13:11,655
Absolutely.

264
00:13:11,758 --> 00:13:13,724
- Thank you so much.
- Thank you.

265
00:13:13,793 --> 00:13:15,586
All right,
I'm gonna head out and

266
00:13:15,655 --> 00:13:17,896
file the paperwork
and get the transfers ready.

267
00:13:19,310 --> 00:13:21,241
And I think
that's about everything.

268
00:13:22,586 --> 00:13:26,275
Well... almost everything.

269
00:13:37,517 --> 00:13:39,448
Who the hell is this?

270
00:13:39,482 --> 00:13:42,275
Victoria Washington,
meet Anna Washington.

271
00:13:42,310 --> 00:13:43,344
Your niece.

272
00:13:43,413 --> 00:13:45,206
Niece?

273
00:13:45,275 --> 00:13:46,551
Hey, auntie.

274
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:48,689
I didn't know my uncle
was married.

275
00:13:48,758 --> 00:13:50,103
I bet you didn't.

276
00:13:50,137 --> 00:13:51,482
Typical distant relative

277
00:13:51,586 --> 00:13:53,413
trying to rush in to
collect a quick check.

278
00:13:53,482 --> 00:13:55,310
When was the last time
you talked to Richard?

279
00:13:55,413 --> 00:13:56,551
Victoria.

280
00:13:56,620 --> 00:13:58,103
You didn't even come
his funeral.

281
00:13:58,137 --> 00:13:59,448
I didn't know...

282
00:13:59,482 --> 00:14:01,517
You don't deserve
any of this money.

283
00:14:01,551 --> 00:14:04,275
Victoria! Let go. Now.

284
00:14:04,344 --> 00:14:05,793
Sorry.

285
00:14:05,862 --> 00:14:07,172
You okay?

286
00:14:07,793 --> 00:14:09,275
Yeah.

287
00:14:09,344 --> 00:14:11,137
Let's just go.

288
00:14:17,517 --> 00:14:19,965
Okay, that's all of it.

289
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,275
Wow.

290
00:14:22,344 --> 00:14:25,862
Everything is so... extravagant.

291
00:14:25,931 --> 00:14:27,724
You'll get used to it.

292
00:14:27,793 --> 00:14:29,724
I'm going to tell the chef
to start dinner.

293
00:14:29,793 --> 00:14:32,689
If you need anything, give me
a holler. I'll be close by.

294
00:14:32,758 --> 00:14:34,172
Thanks.

295
00:14:37,379 --> 00:14:38,862
How you feeling?

296
00:14:38,965 --> 00:14:41,896
Honestly? Disconnected.

297
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,827
There's not one touch
of personality in here.

298
00:14:43,896 --> 00:14:47,275
And you know what else I've
noticed? Not one family photo.

299
00:14:47,344 --> 00:14:49,034
I don't know, this place
just kind of...

300
00:14:49,068 --> 00:14:52,379
reminds me what my relationship
with my uncle became.

301
00:14:52,482 --> 00:14:54,275
Distant and unfamiliar.

302
00:14:57,034 --> 00:14:58,310
Don't overthink things, Anna.

303
00:14:58,379 --> 00:14:59,862
I'm sure you meant
something to him,

304
00:14:59,965 --> 00:15:02,000
even if it doesn't feel like it.

305
00:15:02,068 --> 00:15:05,517
Look at everything he left you.

306
00:15:05,586 --> 00:15:07,758
Hey, I'm gonna give you
a minute.

307
00:15:07,793 --> 00:15:10,551
I'm sure there's a hot tub
around here somewhere.

308
00:15:10,586 --> 00:15:12,551
- Let's go.
- Girl.

309
00:16:07,758 --> 00:16:10,724
I'm so sorry.
I didn't mean to scare you.

310
00:16:10,793 --> 00:16:12,413
I'm Emily, the housekeeper.

311
00:16:12,448 --> 00:16:15,448
- Oh. Hi. I'm...
- Anna, Anna. I know.

312
00:16:15,517 --> 00:16:18,275
I was the one who buzzed you
and your friend in.

313
00:16:18,344 --> 00:16:20,965
I just wanted to make sure
everything was tidy for you.

314
00:16:21,068 --> 00:16:22,241
I figured you'd use this room,

315
00:16:22,310 --> 00:16:24,448
so I put Richard's things away.

316
00:16:24,517 --> 00:16:27,448
They're boxed up downstairs
if you want go through anything.

317
00:16:27,517 --> 00:16:30,275
And, for what it's worth,
I'm sorry for your loss.

318
00:16:30,344 --> 00:16:32,896
Richard was a wonderful man.

319
00:16:32,965 --> 00:16:34,551
Thank you, Emily.

320
00:16:37,103 --> 00:16:38,655
You painted that, didn't you?

321
00:16:40,482 --> 00:16:41,931
When I was five.

322
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,241
I'm amazed he kept it
all these years.

323
00:16:44,310 --> 00:16:45,448
Yeah.

324
00:16:45,517 --> 00:16:47,448
Well, I'll leave you to it then.

325
00:16:47,551 --> 00:16:48,758
Hey, uh...

326
00:16:48,793 --> 00:16:51,620
There's no way he died
from an overdose, right?

327
00:16:51,724 --> 00:16:53,793
What did you just say?

328
00:16:53,896 --> 00:16:55,482
Brian said my uncle died

329
00:16:55,586 --> 00:16:58,310
from a heart attack, but that
it was caused by a drug use.

330
00:16:58,413 --> 00:17:02,241
Anna, I've worked for your uncle
for over ten years.

331
00:17:02,310 --> 00:17:06,724
He enjoyed his whiskey,
but he didn't use drugs.

332
00:17:06,827 --> 00:17:10,103
So, there's a chance he didn't
die from an overdose?

333
00:17:38,862 --> 00:17:40,068
Dr. Jones speaking.

334
00:17:40,137 --> 00:17:41,206
Sorry for calling so late.

335
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:42,551
My name is Anna Washington.

336
00:17:42,655 --> 00:17:44,175
I have some questions
about an autopsy.

337
00:17:44,241 --> 00:17:45,601
How can I help you,
Ms. Washington?

338
00:17:45,655 --> 00:17:47,551
Yes, I received
the autopsy report

339
00:17:47,655 --> 00:17:49,206
for my uncle,
Richard Washington.

340
00:17:49,310 --> 00:17:51,724
Oh! Yes, I heard about
his passing.

341
00:17:51,793 --> 00:17:54,137
- So tragic.
- Yes.

342
00:17:54,172 --> 00:17:55,692
I have some questions
about the report.

343
00:17:55,724 --> 00:17:57,413
I was wondering if you
might be available.

344
00:17:57,482 --> 00:17:59,896
Do you want a
second autopsy performed?

345
00:17:59,965 --> 00:18:01,827
Uh, not exactly.

346
00:18:01,896 --> 00:18:03,724
Tell you what,
I'll run a couple of more test,

347
00:18:03,793 --> 00:18:05,034
then be in touch.

348
00:18:05,103 --> 00:18:07,068
That would be great.
Thank you so much.

349
00:18:10,448 --> 00:18:12,862
Didn't want to interrupt
your call, I'm sorry.

350
00:18:12,896 --> 00:18:13,896
Dinner is ready.

351
00:18:13,965 --> 00:18:15,517
Okay. Thanks.

352
00:18:17,965 --> 00:18:20,551
Bitch, you know you
rich when you can't pronounce

353
00:18:20,620 --> 00:18:22,820
what's on the plate, but you
know food about to be bomb.

354
00:18:26,103 --> 00:18:28,034
What's wrong?

355
00:18:28,068 --> 00:18:31,586
- It's... nothing.
- Hi, ladies.

356
00:18:31,655 --> 00:18:33,689
I was about to head home,
but wanted to check in.

357
00:18:33,758 --> 00:18:35,551
Is there anything else you need?

358
00:18:35,586 --> 00:18:38,724
You're leaving? Why don't you
stay and have dinner with us?

359
00:18:38,793 --> 00:18:42,310
- I'm sorry?
- Dinner. Food. Have some.

360
00:18:42,379 --> 00:18:44,931
Yeah, we ain't eatin' all
this by ourselves.

361
00:18:45,034 --> 00:18:46,586
- You too!
- Mhm-hm.

362
00:18:50,103 --> 00:18:52,931
Well, if you insist.

363
00:18:53,034 --> 00:18:54,448
A brother is hungry.

364
00:18:59,862 --> 00:19:01,310
No.

365
00:19:02,862 --> 00:19:04,448
Okay, wait, wait.

366
00:19:04,482 --> 00:19:08,344
Five years working for my uncle.
How was that?

367
00:19:08,448 --> 00:19:10,137
Some of the best years
of my life.

368
00:19:10,206 --> 00:19:11,793
Richard was very good to me.

369
00:19:11,862 --> 00:19:13,344
Were you two close?

370
00:19:13,448 --> 00:19:17,689
I mean, we weren't best friends
or anything, but...

371
00:19:20,206 --> 00:19:21,586
I'm really gonna miss him.

372
00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:23,000
So, now what?

373
00:19:23,068 --> 00:19:26,103
You spent five years dedicating
your life to someone else.

374
00:19:26,172 --> 00:19:28,344
Where do you go from here?

375
00:19:28,448 --> 00:19:30,103
I want a chance
to prove my worth.

376
00:19:30,172 --> 00:19:31,724
Maybe become a partner.

377
00:19:31,793 --> 00:19:35,103
I just want to be taken
more seriously.

378
00:19:35,172 --> 00:19:37,827
Me too! But, as an artist.

379
00:19:38,965 --> 00:19:41,137
I was about to be nominated for

380
00:19:41,172 --> 00:19:45,655
a content creator position,
but that plan is gone now

381
00:19:45,758 --> 00:19:47,862
along with Richard.

382
00:19:47,931 --> 00:19:49,241
Why is that?

383
00:19:50,655 --> 00:19:53,034
My uncle. James.

384
00:19:53,103 --> 00:19:56,862
The CFO of Washington Inc...

385
00:19:56,931 --> 00:19:58,137
and your number two.

386
00:19:58,206 --> 00:19:59,206
Oh!

387
00:19:59,275 --> 00:20:01,482
Your uncle's the CFO?

388
00:20:01,551 --> 00:20:05,103
Yeah, I don't know why, but
he never supported me.

389
00:20:05,137 --> 00:20:07,862
If anything,
he only held me back.

390
00:20:07,931 --> 00:20:09,275
It'd be your own people.

391
00:20:09,344 --> 00:20:12,137
Okay, wait, so,
there is something

392
00:20:12,206 --> 00:20:13,631
I want to ask
that's been bugging me.

393
00:20:13,655 --> 00:20:15,793
- What's that?
- Why didn't my uncle

394
00:20:15,827 --> 00:20:18,655
leave anything to James or Janet
or anyone else?

395
00:20:20,034 --> 00:20:23,758
Probably because he knows
what they're capable of.

396
00:20:23,793 --> 00:20:25,344
And what exactly is that?

397
00:20:25,448 --> 00:20:28,310
What the hell
are you still doing here?

398
00:20:28,379 --> 00:20:30,758
Enjoying my food, niece?

399
00:20:32,103 --> 00:20:33,343
You know you're not supposed to

400
00:20:33,379 --> 00:20:34,758
eat out here.
None of the staff is.

401
00:20:34,793 --> 00:20:36,137
I asked him to join us.

402
00:20:36,206 --> 00:20:38,482
And he knew better
than to accept.

403
00:20:40,620 --> 00:20:43,655
You know, it's funny, Darren.

404
00:20:43,724 --> 00:20:46,724
She's taking my money
and my house

405
00:20:46,793 --> 00:20:49,862
and she's taking your
opportunity for a promotion.

406
00:20:51,482 --> 00:20:54,586
And all she had to do
was show up.

407
00:21:01,172 --> 00:21:02,862
- I'm sorry, Darren.
- She's right.

408
00:21:02,931 --> 00:21:05,655
I should go.
But thank you for dinner.

409
00:21:11,862 --> 00:21:13,827
Will you ladies
be staying overnight?

410
00:21:13,896 --> 00:21:16,000
No. We should
probably get going.

411
00:21:16,068 --> 00:21:17,551
Thank you so much for dinner.

412
00:21:17,620 --> 00:21:19,420
And please help yourselves
to whatever's left.

413
00:21:19,448 --> 00:21:21,448
Wait! What?
Why are we leaving?

414
00:21:21,517 --> 00:21:23,000
Because of your fake auntie?

415
00:21:23,068 --> 00:21:24,689
No, I'm just ready to go home.

416
00:21:24,724 --> 00:21:27,586
- This is your home now.
- No. It's not.

417
00:21:27,655 --> 00:21:29,827
Let's go, Ken.

418
00:21:29,862 --> 00:21:31,310
Dang!

419
00:21:49,413 --> 00:21:52,724
Hey, girl. I got your text.
What's going on?

420
00:21:52,793 --> 00:21:54,758
The money transferred to
my account this morning!

421
00:21:54,862 --> 00:21:57,206
I now officially own
this gallery. Paid in full!

422
00:21:58,551 --> 00:22:02,103
Oh, and one more thing...

423
00:22:02,172 --> 00:22:03,586
Little something for you.

424
00:22:07,551 --> 00:22:08,551
Are you for real?

425
00:22:08,620 --> 00:22:10,620
It's the least I could do.

426
00:22:10,689 --> 00:22:12,275
Thank you for always
being there for me.

427
00:22:12,344 --> 00:22:14,068
Being your friend
finally paid up!

428
00:22:14,103 --> 00:22:16,724
Girl, shut up!

429
00:22:16,758 --> 00:22:18,931
- Thank you, girl.
- Of course.

430
00:22:21,103 --> 00:22:22,586
What's wrong?

431
00:22:23,896 --> 00:22:27,103
I don't know, Ken,
I have mixed feelings.

432
00:22:27,172 --> 00:22:28,448
A part of me just

433
00:22:28,517 --> 00:22:29,907
feels like I would
give all of this back

434
00:22:29,931 --> 00:22:31,424
if I could have just
fixed the relationship

435
00:22:31,448 --> 00:22:32,793
with my uncle instead.

436
00:22:32,862 --> 00:22:35,620
Anna, this is what
your uncle wanted!

437
00:22:35,689 --> 00:22:38,551
We should be celebrating him,
celebrating life!

438
00:22:38,620 --> 00:22:39,896
Come on.

439
00:22:41,413 --> 00:22:42,655
You're right. You're right.

440
00:22:42,724 --> 00:22:44,931
- We should celebrate.
- Mhm-hm.

441
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,655
And I know just the thing.

442
00:22:46,724 --> 00:22:49,655
Oh, we gonna have some fun.

443
00:22:52,172 --> 00:22:53,793
Hey!

444
00:22:56,724 --> 00:22:57,965
Perfect.

445
00:23:00,172 --> 00:23:02,586
Nice.

446
00:23:02,655 --> 00:23:04,310
Very nice, little more shading.

447
00:23:04,344 --> 00:23:06,068
Right there. Yeah.

448
00:23:09,137 --> 00:23:11,896
Beautiful!

449
00:23:11,965 --> 00:23:14,413
Nice.

450
00:23:14,482 --> 00:23:18,275
Ooh, girl, I'm ready to party.

451
00:23:18,310 --> 00:23:19,482
Hey.

452
00:23:19,551 --> 00:23:21,172
- Hey, girl.
- Hey.

453
00:23:21,206 --> 00:23:24,862
So... When you said we should
celebrate, I was picturing

454
00:23:24,965 --> 00:23:28,482
a pool party, something,
ratchet, but this?

455
00:23:30,068 --> 00:23:31,620
This is...

456
00:23:34,241 --> 00:23:35,551
This is perfect.

457
00:23:35,620 --> 00:23:37,724
Yeah, I'm gonna go change.

458
00:23:37,793 --> 00:23:39,310
Okay.

459
00:23:39,344 --> 00:23:41,862
- Hey.
- Hey.

460
00:23:41,965 --> 00:23:44,517
Looks like
you're settling in nicely.

461
00:23:44,586 --> 00:23:47,827
Yeah! I figured why
not do something fun?

462
00:23:47,862 --> 00:23:50,896
- Hey, about the other night...
- Don't worry about it.

463
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,103
You have to have thick skin in
this business.

464
00:23:53,172 --> 00:23:57,758
Plus, I get inspiration from
seeing other's success, too.

465
00:23:57,827 --> 00:24:00,482
Okay, well, today, let's just
put that all behind us.

466
00:24:00,517 --> 00:24:01,793
Please, grab a canvas!

467
00:24:01,862 --> 00:24:03,413
Teaching is kind of my jam.

468
00:24:03,482 --> 00:24:07,206
Actually, I think we could
use a different subject, Anna.

469
00:24:07,241 --> 00:24:08,379
We could?

470
00:24:08,448 --> 00:24:10,724
Yeah! I mean, still life is fun,

471
00:24:10,758 --> 00:24:13,689
but I think we could use
a live model.

472
00:24:16,517 --> 00:24:18,379
- Oh, yes.
- Yes.

473
00:24:18,448 --> 00:24:20,068
Uh, Darren...

474
00:24:20,137 --> 00:24:23,241
would you mind modeling for us?

475
00:24:23,310 --> 00:24:25,034
Uh, okay.

476
00:24:25,103 --> 00:24:26,379
Sure.

477
00:24:26,413 --> 00:24:29,241
Yeah, go on and lose
the shirt, player.

478
00:24:29,344 --> 00:24:31,862
Yeah.

479
00:24:31,896 --> 00:24:33,517
Here we go.

480
00:24:38,758 --> 00:24:41,862
Damn, girl.
That thing is thangin'!

481
00:24:41,896 --> 00:24:43,379
Oooh!

482
00:24:43,448 --> 00:24:45,724
- Ooh! Listen...
- You are so bad.

483
00:24:51,448 --> 00:24:53,724
Phew! Nice job.

484
00:24:53,758 --> 00:24:56,620
Thanks.
And thanks for modeling earlier.

485
00:24:56,724 --> 00:24:58,079
Sorry to put you on the
spot like that.

486
00:24:58,103 --> 00:25:00,448
But you'd actually make
a pretty good model.

487
00:25:00,551 --> 00:25:03,482
You think I'm good enough
to be on GQ?

488
00:25:03,551 --> 00:25:05,172
Okay, I ain't say all that.

489
00:25:06,931 --> 00:25:08,965
What in the hell...

490
00:25:10,689 --> 00:25:12,620
Here we go again.

491
00:25:12,689 --> 00:25:14,827
What do you think
that you're doing?

492
00:25:14,931 --> 00:25:15,862
Excuse me?

493
00:25:15,931 --> 00:25:17,482
You heard me!

494
00:25:17,551 --> 00:25:19,620
- What do think we doing?
- I'm not talking to you!

495
00:25:19,655 --> 00:25:21,379
You need to pack all this stuff

496
00:25:21,448 --> 00:25:22,931
and get these people
out of my house.

497
00:25:22,965 --> 00:25:24,275
- Your house?
- Your house?

498
00:25:24,344 --> 00:25:25,896
That's right.

499
00:25:25,965 --> 00:25:27,596
Last I checked, my uncle left
this house to me.

500
00:25:27,620 --> 00:25:29,206
Well, check again, honey.

501
00:25:29,275 --> 00:25:30,965
I'm taking your ass to court,

502
00:25:31,034 --> 00:25:32,448
and when I do,

503
00:25:32,482 --> 00:25:35,689
you'll be crawling back to
the slums where you belong.

504
00:25:35,793 --> 00:25:38,310
You need to lower that finger
if you wanna keep it.

505
00:25:38,379 --> 00:25:39,724
Are you threatening me?

506
00:25:39,793 --> 00:25:41,103
Victoria, please don't do this.

507
00:25:41,172 --> 00:25:44,931
Shut up. You and your worthless
boy toy here

508
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,689
need to get all
these people out of

509
00:25:46,758 --> 00:25:48,172
my house before I come back or...

510
00:25:48,275 --> 00:25:49,931
Or what?

511
00:25:49,965 --> 00:25:50,965
How about this?

512
00:25:51,034 --> 00:25:52,206
You don't come back

513
00:25:52,275 --> 00:25:54,113
and you pack all your shit
and get out of my house.

514
00:25:54,137 --> 00:25:57,068
And I'll have your papers
served in the morning.

515
00:25:59,517 --> 00:26:01,068
- Okay.
- Yeah, okay.

516
00:26:01,172 --> 00:26:02,172
Mhm-hm.

517
00:26:02,206 --> 00:26:03,896
That's my girl!

518
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,862
Okay? Hmm.

519
00:26:05,931 --> 00:26:08,103
- Bye.
- Wow! That...

520
00:26:08,172 --> 00:26:10,413
I am so sorry
about that, everyone.

521
00:26:10,517 --> 00:26:12,517
Please let's get back to it.

522
00:26:15,068 --> 00:26:16,517
Mhm.

523
00:26:18,655 --> 00:26:20,862
Yo, that's the first time

524
00:26:20,931 --> 00:26:23,068
I've ever seen Victoria
rendered speechless.

525
00:26:23,137 --> 00:26:26,344
I have to be honest, I kind of
surprised myself with that one.

526
00:26:26,379 --> 00:26:29,655
That's the attitude
you need to be a CEO.

527
00:26:30,827 --> 00:26:32,827
If that's what I decide to be.

528
00:26:34,344 --> 00:26:36,551
What's stopping you?

529
00:26:36,620 --> 00:26:39,172
I don't want to be
a corporate shark,

530
00:26:39,206 --> 00:26:42,034
and I'm the least qualified
person to be CEO, so...

531
00:26:43,448 --> 00:26:45,034
But then I see women like

532
00:26:45,103 --> 00:26:47,448
Rosalind Brewer
and Thasunda Duckett,

533
00:26:47,517 --> 00:26:50,724
CEOs of Fortune 500 companies,
so...

534
00:26:50,827 --> 00:26:52,241
I guess why not me?

535
00:26:54,034 --> 00:26:55,241
Hey.

536
00:26:56,655 --> 00:26:58,724
Maybe this time next year,

537
00:26:58,793 --> 00:27:00,758
your name would be
right there with them.

538
00:27:02,413 --> 00:27:03,896
You think so?

539
00:27:15,310 --> 00:27:17,931
- Expecting an important call?
- Kind of.

540
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,310
I'm waiting for Dr. Jones
to call me back.

541
00:27:20,413 --> 00:27:22,241
The overdose thing?

542
00:27:22,310 --> 00:27:24,827
I overheard your call
the other day.

543
00:27:24,931 --> 00:27:26,896
I'm glad you're looking into it.
It was...

544
00:27:26,931 --> 00:27:28,931
hard for me to believe, too.

545
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,206
Yeah.

546
00:27:37,758 --> 00:27:40,413
I cannot believe that bastard
didn't leave me anything!

547
00:27:40,482 --> 00:27:42,517
How am I supposed
to support myself?

548
00:27:42,586 --> 00:27:44,344
This is ridiculous, Brian.

549
00:27:44,448 --> 00:27:48,586
- You have got to calm down.
- Do not tell me to calm down.

550
00:27:52,827 --> 00:27:54,000
Listen.

551
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,896
I'll fix this.

552
00:27:56,965 --> 00:27:58,517
How?

553
00:27:58,586 --> 00:28:01,275
I have an idea,
but these things take time.

554
00:28:01,344 --> 00:28:03,241
I got you.

555
00:28:09,034 --> 00:28:10,551
You promise?

556
00:28:10,620 --> 00:28:12,034
I promise.

557
00:28:25,931 --> 00:28:28,068
Exactly what drugs were
in his system when he died?

558
00:28:28,172 --> 00:28:29,931
I couldn't get
a definitive answer,

559
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:33,241
which is why the state listed
his death as an overdose.

560
00:28:33,310 --> 00:28:35,586
Well, did you see anything

561
00:28:35,689 --> 00:28:37,655
that could have caused
a heart attack?

562
00:28:37,724 --> 00:28:40,413
Maybe. While there were
small amounts of drugs found,

563
00:28:40,482 --> 00:28:43,068
it wasn't clear if the heart
attack was induced by drug use

564
00:28:43,172 --> 00:28:44,827
or if it was natural.

565
00:28:47,655 --> 00:28:50,068
Is there any way to check again?

566
00:28:50,172 --> 00:28:51,965
I ran the report twice.

567
00:28:55,034 --> 00:28:57,517
Look, Dr. Jones.

568
00:28:57,586 --> 00:29:00,172
He was my last blood relative

569
00:29:00,241 --> 00:29:02,965
and I just really want to get
closure on what happened to him.

570
00:29:04,965 --> 00:29:06,769
I'll check with the lab
to see if there are any samples

571
00:29:06,793 --> 00:29:08,310
left from the autopsy.

572
00:29:08,413 --> 00:29:11,068
If so, I'll run another test
and email you the results.

573
00:29:12,413 --> 00:29:14,448
I really appreciate it.

574
00:29:14,482 --> 00:29:15,793
- Going down?
- No.

575
00:29:15,896 --> 00:29:17,482
I need to lock up the office.

576
00:29:17,586 --> 00:29:20,034
- Thank you again.
- No problem.

577
00:30:02,965 --> 00:30:05,586
Somebody! Help!

578
00:30:27,482 --> 00:30:29,862
Okay. What do you think?

579
00:30:31,448 --> 00:30:34,965
Eh. I've never been
to anything like this before,

580
00:30:35,034 --> 00:30:38,068
I don't know
what we should wear, Ken.

581
00:30:38,137 --> 00:30:41,586
Have you decided what you're
gonna do about the CEO gig yet?

582
00:30:41,620 --> 00:30:43,620
I think...

583
00:30:43,655 --> 00:30:44,965
the position
should go to someone

584
00:30:45,034 --> 00:30:47,068
a bit more capable than I am.

585
00:30:47,137 --> 00:30:48,137
Hm.

586
00:30:51,551 --> 00:30:53,689
Whoa.
That's an interesting choice.

587
00:30:53,758 --> 00:30:55,206
Why, thank you, darling.

588
00:30:55,275 --> 00:30:56,862
It's Avant Garde.

589
00:30:56,931 --> 00:30:58,724
More like Savage X Fenty!

590
00:31:00,206 --> 00:31:03,034
What's all this?

591
00:31:03,137 --> 00:31:04,620
Come take a look.

592
00:31:06,379 --> 00:31:09,827
These are beautiful!
Where did they come from?

593
00:31:09,862 --> 00:31:11,655
From me.

594
00:31:13,793 --> 00:31:15,689
Listen, I know how hard
it can be

595
00:31:15,758 --> 00:31:18,034
trying to find the right dress.

596
00:31:18,137 --> 00:31:20,517
Thank you, Janet.
This is so generous.

597
00:31:20,586 --> 00:31:21,965
Do not thank me.

598
00:31:22,034 --> 00:31:24,793
I'll see you in a few hours.
Don't be late.

599
00:31:24,862 --> 00:31:27,275
- Okay?
- Yes.

600
00:31:29,517 --> 00:31:31,596
- Okay, girl, me first.
- Okay, all right, all right.

601
00:31:31,620 --> 00:31:33,517
- Wow!
- Hey, girl, thank you.

602
00:31:33,620 --> 00:31:35,068
Yes, thank you.

603
00:31:38,586 --> 00:31:40,000
Hey.

604
00:31:47,034 --> 00:31:48,344
I'm...

605
00:31:48,413 --> 00:31:49,655
I'm sorry.

606
00:31:49,689 --> 00:31:51,758
No, it's okay.

607
00:31:54,862 --> 00:31:56,689
What do you think?

608
00:31:59,172 --> 00:32:01,137
I think you're amazing.

609
00:32:09,379 --> 00:32:11,724
I guess we should get going.

610
00:32:11,758 --> 00:32:14,344
Definitely. Okay.

611
00:32:14,413 --> 00:32:16,344
Thanks.

So, most of the people here
are board members

623
00:33:11,517 --> 00:33:13,655
or top executives
from either Washington Inc.

624
00:33:13,724 --> 00:33:15,172
Or one of our company partners.

625
00:33:15,275 --> 00:33:17,931
- Got it.
- Darren, good evening.

626
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,482
You must be Anna.
You look lovely.

627
00:33:20,551 --> 00:33:22,965
Thank you. And you are?

628
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,517
James Buchanan, CFO.

629
00:33:25,586 --> 00:33:27,758
- Number two, right?
- Right.

630
00:33:27,827 --> 00:33:29,275
Anna, I hear
you'll be delivering

631
00:33:29,344 --> 00:33:31,344
a rousing speech
for us this evening.

632
00:33:31,413 --> 00:33:34,000
- I might say a few words...
- Terrific. I can't wait.

633
00:33:34,103 --> 00:33:36,068
Darren, why don't you make
yourself useful

634
00:33:36,137 --> 00:33:37,655
and introduce Anna
to our partners.

635
00:33:37,724 --> 00:33:38,896
That's what I was doing.

636
00:33:38,965 --> 00:33:40,551
Just don't screw it up
this time.

637
00:33:40,620 --> 00:33:42,137
- Hm.
- Anna.

638
00:33:45,482 --> 00:33:46,931
So...

639
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:50,551
my nemesis is Victoria,
and yours is your uncle.

640
00:33:52,448 --> 00:33:54,896
What a tangled web.

641
00:33:54,965 --> 00:33:57,068
Come on, let me show you around.

642
00:33:57,137 --> 00:33:58,206
Ah!

643
00:33:59,793 --> 00:34:02,000
- Nice to meet you.
- My pleasure.

644
00:34:02,068 --> 00:34:04,172
- Hi, I'm Anna.
- Nice to meet you.

645
00:34:04,241 --> 00:34:06,034
Thank you.
Thank you so much.

646
00:34:06,068 --> 00:34:09,000
Hi. Nice to meet you.

647
00:34:14,551 --> 00:34:16,206
You good?

648
00:34:16,275 --> 00:34:18,241
Yeah.

649
00:34:18,344 --> 00:34:20,827
So many people...

650
00:34:20,896 --> 00:34:22,551
They're about to
start dinner soon.

651
00:34:22,655 --> 00:34:24,103
Great, I'm starving.

652
00:34:25,413 --> 00:34:27,000
Oh, look. There's Janet.

653
00:34:28,482 --> 00:34:30,551
Darren! Anna!

654
00:34:30,620 --> 00:34:32,137
Wow!

655
00:34:32,206 --> 00:34:34,172
You look absolutely stunning.

656
00:34:34,241 --> 00:34:35,965
Thank you. And thank you so much

657
00:34:36,034 --> 00:34:37,482
for this dress.
It fits perfectly.

658
00:34:37,551 --> 00:34:40,793
Yes, it does.
May I see the whole...

659
00:34:40,862 --> 00:34:41,965
Yes, it does, honey.

660
00:34:42,034 --> 00:34:43,206
It's perfect.

661
00:34:43,241 --> 00:34:45,206
- Thank you.
- Yes. You're welcome.

662
00:34:45,241 --> 00:34:47,413
Okay, let's talk more.

663
00:34:47,517 --> 00:34:48,896
What you working with?

664
00:34:48,965 --> 00:34:50,206
What you working with?

665
00:34:50,241 --> 00:34:53,551
I see your friend
is enjoying herself.

666
00:34:54,724 --> 00:34:56,413
Yeah, that's my girl over there.

667
00:34:56,482 --> 00:34:58,758
We livin' large
and takin' charge, baby.

668
00:34:58,862 --> 00:35:00,793
We finna take over
this thang, okay?

669
00:35:00,896 --> 00:35:03,448
Started from the bottom,
now we here!

670
00:35:03,482 --> 00:35:05,275
Tell me, is that, um,

671
00:35:05,310 --> 00:35:08,586
is that dress from
the collection that I sent over?

672
00:35:10,137 --> 00:35:12,206
Well...

673
00:35:12,275 --> 00:35:14,103
Mhm-hm.

674
00:35:14,137 --> 00:35:16,482
So what do you intend
to do about her?

675
00:35:16,551 --> 00:35:18,793
I'm not sure, yet.

676
00:35:18,827 --> 00:35:19,941
You think shell
announce her decision

677
00:35:19,965 --> 00:35:21,724
about her being
CEO next tonight?

678
00:35:21,793 --> 00:35:23,034
If she's smart, she will.

679
00:35:25,965 --> 00:35:28,413
She actually had the nerve
to show up.

680
00:35:30,103 --> 00:35:31,551
Richard always made poor choices

681
00:35:31,620 --> 00:35:33,827
when it came to the women
he kept around.

682
00:35:33,931 --> 00:35:38,206
That's funny. Looks like your
nephew has the same problem.

683
00:35:38,275 --> 00:35:41,482
My nephew is none
of your concern.

684
00:35:41,551 --> 00:35:43,068
What you should
be worried about is,

685
00:35:43,137 --> 00:35:46,034
how insignificant your life is

686
00:35:46,103 --> 00:35:48,000
now that Richard's gone.

687
00:35:53,275 --> 00:35:55,206
Could I have everyone's
attention, please?

688
00:35:55,275 --> 00:35:57,862
Tonight, we are here
to celebrate

689
00:35:57,931 --> 00:36:00,827
the memory of
Richard Washington...

690
00:36:00,862 --> 00:36:02,379
and continue the legacy

691
00:36:02,448 --> 00:36:05,586
of what he started here
at Washington Inc.

692
00:36:05,655 --> 00:36:07,275
Leo Tolstoy once said that,

693
00:36:07,344 --> 00:36:11,000
everyone believes in changing
the world, but no one...

694
00:36:11,034 --> 00:36:13,172
believes in changing themselves.

695
00:36:14,448 --> 00:36:17,137
Richard always believed
in change.

696
00:36:17,206 --> 00:36:19,724
In fact, he challenged
every one of us

697
00:36:19,793 --> 00:36:23,620
around him to keep growing,
and keep changing.

698
00:36:23,689 --> 00:36:26,103
And here at Washington Inc.,
we will...

699
00:36:26,172 --> 00:36:28,758
keep growing, we will keep
changing too.

700
00:36:30,379 --> 00:36:32,275
Yes, we will.
Thank you, James.

701
00:36:32,344 --> 00:36:34,482
Um, I really wanna thank...

702
00:36:34,551 --> 00:36:37,034
all of you
for joining us tonight.

703
00:36:37,103 --> 00:36:39,655
Um, it is especially hard

704
00:36:39,724 --> 00:36:42,827
with the loss of
our dear friend and leader.

705
00:36:42,862 --> 00:36:44,310
Richard was a forward...

706
00:36:44,379 --> 00:36:45,793
Who's that?

707
00:36:45,862 --> 00:36:47,527
Oh, that's one of
the dudes I'm shortlisting

708
00:36:47,551 --> 00:36:48,689
on my sugar daddy hunt.

709
00:36:48,793 --> 00:36:51,241
A little quiet, but he cool.

710
00:36:51,310 --> 00:36:52,965
Mhm-hm.

711
00:36:53,034 --> 00:36:55,137
Anna?

712
00:36:55,206 --> 00:36:57,448
Would you join us, please?

713
00:37:03,586 --> 00:37:05,068
Thank you.

714
00:37:09,689 --> 00:37:11,655
- You got this.
- Okay.

715
00:37:13,862 --> 00:37:15,586
Good evening, everyone.

716
00:37:16,827 --> 00:37:19,620
My name is Anna Washington, and,

717
00:37:19,724 --> 00:37:22,931
as most of you know,
I'm Richard's niece...

718
00:37:23,034 --> 00:37:26,379
and the daughter
of William Washington,

719
00:37:26,448 --> 00:37:29,758
who co-founded this
company with my uncle.

720
00:37:29,793 --> 00:37:34,586
My father often spoke about
the importance of legacy.

721
00:37:34,655 --> 00:37:36,620
He told me...

722
00:37:36,689 --> 00:37:38,517
the most important thing
you leave behind

723
00:37:38,586 --> 00:37:42,413
are the memories left with those
whose lives you've touched.

724
00:37:42,448 --> 00:37:45,103
Washington Inc.
Has been improving

725
00:37:45,206 --> 00:37:47,275
and touching millions
of lives all over the world

726
00:37:47,344 --> 00:37:49,275
for more than 20 years now,

727
00:37:49,344 --> 00:37:51,724
with a history of leading
the advancement of technology

728
00:37:51,758 --> 00:37:53,517
through continued innovation.

729
00:37:55,103 --> 00:37:57,103
As James said,

730
00:37:57,206 --> 00:38:00,206
my uncle wanted
this company to grow.

731
00:38:00,275 --> 00:38:03,862
And nothing represents growth
more than a new CEO.

732
00:38:03,965 --> 00:38:07,241
I want to ensure that the
next leader of Washington Inc.

733
00:38:07,310 --> 00:38:08,862
Will continue my uncle's legacy

734
00:38:08,931 --> 00:38:11,275
of helping others
reach their full potential.

735
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,862
And so with that,

736
00:38:15,931 --> 00:38:20,379
I'm announcing that the new CEO
of Washington Inc. will be...

737
00:38:26,655 --> 00:38:28,000
me.

738
00:38:45,344 --> 00:38:47,827
Yo, that was dope.
Did you plan that?

739
00:38:47,931 --> 00:38:50,344
No. In fact, I need some air.

740
00:38:50,413 --> 00:38:52,724
Okay, bathroom's
right over there.

741
00:38:52,793 --> 00:38:54,241
Okay.

742
00:38:57,103 --> 00:38:58,551
Wow!

743
00:39:03,965 --> 00:39:05,137
Ah!

744
00:39:16,344 --> 00:39:18,758
What?

745
00:39:18,862 --> 00:39:22,862
If this is just a sneaky
link thing, that's fine.

746
00:39:22,931 --> 00:39:25,137
Just let me know, so were
both on the same page.

747
00:39:26,551 --> 00:39:28,655
Oh, it's good sex,

748
00:39:28,724 --> 00:39:29,827
but...

749
00:39:29,896 --> 00:39:31,310
let's not complicate things.

750
00:39:31,344 --> 00:39:33,655
It was hard enough
keeping it from Richard.

751
00:39:33,689 --> 00:39:35,310
What makes you think
he didn't know?

752
00:39:40,068 --> 00:39:41,241
Who are you?

753
00:39:41,344 --> 00:39:42,896
Just hold on a second,
hold on a sec...

754
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,827
- Hey, hey, hey...
- Stop! Get off me!

755
00:39:44,896 --> 00:39:47,344
- Listen to me.
- Help! Help!

756
00:39:47,379 --> 00:39:49,241
Shh! Look.
This is important, okay?

757
00:39:49,344 --> 00:39:51,024
These people aren't
who you think they are.

758
00:39:51,068 --> 00:39:52,517
What-what do you mean?

759
00:39:52,586 --> 00:39:54,493
You cannot trust them.
All right? Don't trust them.

760
00:39:54,517 --> 00:39:56,517
Hey! What the hell
is going on here?

761
00:39:56,551 --> 00:39:58,148
I'm telling you the truth,
don't trust them.

762
00:39:58,172 --> 00:39:59,482
You can't trust these people.

763
00:39:59,517 --> 00:40:01,113
- Don't trust them...
- Get him out of here.

764
00:40:01,137 --> 00:40:02,320
Don't trust them.
I'm telling you.

765
00:40:02,344 --> 00:40:04,034
Watch your back!
They can't be trusted!

766
00:40:04,137 --> 00:40:05,862
Who is that man?

767
00:40:05,896 --> 00:40:08,862
That man is Carl Lee. Your uncle
fired him before he died.

768
00:40:08,896 --> 00:40:10,896
He's probably trying to
shake you for a check.

769
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,620
You're gonna come across
a lot of crazies like him.

770
00:40:13,655 --> 00:40:15,862
Just be careful.

771
00:40:15,965 --> 00:40:17,689
You're swimming with
the sharks, now.

772
00:40:20,482 --> 00:40:22,000
Come on.

773
00:40:34,862 --> 00:40:36,379
May I help you?

774
00:40:40,344 --> 00:40:44,000
Anna, there's a
detective here to see you.

775
00:40:44,034 --> 00:40:46,344
Ms. Washington,
sorry for the intrusion.

776
00:40:46,379 --> 00:40:49,000
My name is Detective Briggs.
Homicide.

777
00:40:49,034 --> 00:40:50,655
Homicide?

778
00:40:50,689 --> 00:40:52,586
Okay. How can I help you?

779
00:40:52,689 --> 00:40:54,529
A few days ago,
you went to see Dr. Lori Jones,

780
00:40:54,620 --> 00:40:56,448
is that correct?

781
00:40:56,482 --> 00:40:57,310
That's correct.

782
00:40:57,344 --> 00:40:59,586
And what did you see her about?

783
00:40:59,689 --> 00:41:03,448
I had some questions about
my uncle's autopsy report.

784
00:41:03,551 --> 00:41:04,896
Why, did something happen?

785
00:41:04,931 --> 00:41:06,896
Ms. Jones was murdered.

786
00:41:06,965 --> 00:41:08,758
What?

787
00:41:08,827 --> 00:41:13,068
And you were the last person
to see her alive, that is..

788
00:41:13,103 --> 00:41:14,965
In addition,
all of the information

789
00:41:15,068 --> 00:41:16,413
regarding your uncle's death

790
00:41:16,448 --> 00:41:18,586
was stolen or erased
from her computers.

791
00:41:20,068 --> 00:41:21,724
Ms. Washington,

792
00:41:21,758 --> 00:41:23,965
did you happen to notice anyone
suspicious that evening?

793
00:41:24,068 --> 00:41:25,379
Anything out of place?

794
00:41:25,413 --> 00:41:29,241
No. Nothing that stood out.

795
00:41:29,275 --> 00:41:31,724
Well, if you think of something,

796
00:41:31,793 --> 00:41:34,965
give me a call, please.

797
00:41:43,413 --> 00:41:44,724
Ugh!

798
00:41:50,482 --> 00:41:52,896
- Girl, what are you reading?
- Sinful Confessions.

799
00:41:52,931 --> 00:41:54,896
Girl, Bernie just walked into
the courtroom

800
00:41:54,931 --> 00:41:57,044
but Victor said that he didn't
know if she gon' tell the truth,

801
00:41:57,068 --> 00:41:58,217
so, Brookes might deny her
bail...

802
00:41:58,241 --> 00:41:59,896
Kendra, Kendra.

803
00:41:59,931 --> 00:42:02,448
Remember I told you about
that doctor I went to see?

804
00:42:02,482 --> 00:42:03,620
Mm-hmm.

805
00:42:03,655 --> 00:42:05,310
Well, apparently she was killed.

806
00:42:05,379 --> 00:42:07,655
Killed? Damn!

807
00:42:07,689 --> 00:42:10,034
Yeah. That was a detective
at the door.

808
00:42:10,137 --> 00:42:12,034
Was he cute?

809
00:42:12,137 --> 00:42:13,620
Just checking.

810
00:42:14,448 --> 00:42:16,827
What's that face saying?

811
00:42:16,896 --> 00:42:18,655
You don't think
it's odd that she got killed

812
00:42:18,689 --> 00:42:21,448
right after I asked her to check
my uncle's results again?

813
00:42:21,517 --> 00:42:22,620
Maybe...

814
00:42:22,689 --> 00:42:24,379
Well, I do.

815
00:42:24,482 --> 00:42:26,724
It screams cover up.
It's almost like...

816
00:42:26,827 --> 00:42:29,310
there's something someone
doesn't want me to see.

817
00:42:29,379 --> 00:42:32,172
Okay, what does this have to do
with the CEO gig?

818
00:42:32,275 --> 00:42:33,655
I don't know.

819
00:42:33,689 --> 00:42:35,489
But I think it might
be a good way to find out

820
00:42:35,517 --> 00:42:36,827
what they're trying to hide.

821
00:42:36,896 --> 00:42:39,172
Okay, so now you're a CEO
and Nancy Drew?

822
00:42:39,275 --> 00:42:40,827
It's not too late
to turn around.

823
00:42:40,931 --> 00:42:42,206
What do you mean?

824
00:42:42,310 --> 00:42:43,630
Call the suit
and split the shares

825
00:42:43,655 --> 00:42:45,103
with your girl
and Darren's uncle.

826
00:42:45,137 --> 00:42:46,941
If someone is really out here
murkin' for your seat,

827
00:42:46,965 --> 00:42:48,137
just sell the bag.

828
00:42:48,206 --> 00:42:50,586
You can always buy a new one.

829
00:42:50,620 --> 00:42:52,448
No.

830
00:42:52,482 --> 00:42:56,448
My uncle didn't give up on me,
so I won't give up on him.

831
00:42:56,482 --> 00:42:59,206
I know. That's right.
Get 'em, girl, I'm with you.

832
00:42:59,310 --> 00:43:01,517
I support you. You got this.

833
00:43:07,206 --> 00:43:09,241
It's pretty simple.
Um...

834
00:43:09,344 --> 00:43:11,172
Did you... One second.

835
00:43:11,206 --> 00:43:13,413
I'll be right back.

836
00:43:13,517 --> 00:43:15,931
- Hi, good morning.
- Good morning!

837
00:43:16,034 --> 00:43:18,000
Morning.

838
00:43:18,034 --> 00:43:20,103
Here is...

839
00:43:20,206 --> 00:43:21,379
your badge.

840
00:43:21,413 --> 00:43:23,103
And your key card.

841
00:43:23,206 --> 00:43:24,551
Try not to lose that.

842
00:43:24,586 --> 00:43:27,000
They take forever to issue.

843
00:43:27,034 --> 00:43:28,172
Got it.

844
00:43:28,206 --> 00:43:30,551
Welcome to Washington Inc!

845
00:43:30,620 --> 00:43:32,275
Come on, let me take you
on a tour.

846
00:43:32,379 --> 00:43:33,931
That won't be necessary.

847
00:43:34,034 --> 00:43:36,862
I'll take it from here.
Thank you, Darren.

848
00:43:36,896 --> 00:43:41,206
Oh. Um, all right.
Call me if you need anything.

849
00:43:41,275 --> 00:43:43,655
Okay, come, Anna.
Let me show you around.

850
00:43:47,103 --> 00:43:49,379
So, these are
the executive offices.

851
00:43:49,448 --> 00:43:52,034
James's office is over there.

852
00:43:52,103 --> 00:43:54,034
My office is right there.

853
00:43:54,103 --> 00:43:56,241
And this...

854
00:43:59,068 --> 00:44:01,586
is your office.

855
00:44:01,620 --> 00:44:04,241
This was Richard's
home away from home.

856
00:44:04,275 --> 00:44:07,620
He literally spent more time
here than his actual house.

857
00:44:09,482 --> 00:44:11,379
We'll have another one
made for you.

858
00:44:12,448 --> 00:44:14,310
So, how are you feeling? Hm?

859
00:44:14,413 --> 00:44:18,172
Well, last week, I was on the
verge of filing for bankruptcy,

860
00:44:18,275 --> 00:44:22,620
and all of sudden, I'm a CEO
of a major company.

861
00:44:22,655 --> 00:44:23,931
I don't know, I enjoy a come up

862
00:44:23,965 --> 00:44:26,275
as much as the next girl,
but this is...

863
00:44:26,344 --> 00:44:29,103
- A lot.
- A lot.

864
00:44:29,137 --> 00:44:30,724
Darren was telling me that

865
00:44:30,758 --> 00:44:32,413
James owned his own company

866
00:44:32,448 --> 00:44:34,068
before merging with
Washington Inc.

867
00:44:34,103 --> 00:44:35,275
Mhm-hm.

868
00:44:35,344 --> 00:44:36,793
What is he doing here?

869
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:39,793
Between us?

870
00:44:39,896 --> 00:44:41,172
He didn't have a choice.

871
00:44:41,275 --> 00:44:44,448
His company was sinking
and he had to save face, so...

872
00:44:44,482 --> 00:44:47,241
Richard approached him
with an offer

873
00:44:47,275 --> 00:44:48,931
that made sense at the time.

874
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,620
Listen, I know James's
is an odd fit,

875
00:44:51,655 --> 00:44:54,793
but he really is
a good business man.

876
00:44:54,896 --> 00:44:57,586
And Richard was doing him
a favor.

877
00:44:57,655 --> 00:44:59,724
Your uncle was a good man.

878
00:45:01,517 --> 00:45:03,482
I'm sorry to interrupt,

879
00:45:03,517 --> 00:45:05,206
Anna, you have a meeting
in five minutes.

880
00:45:05,310 --> 00:45:07,034
Well, then I better get going,

881
00:45:07,068 --> 00:45:10,000
we don't want to make the CEO
late on her first day, do we?

882
00:45:10,034 --> 00:45:12,448
Listen. You'll be fine.
See you in there.

883
00:45:12,482 --> 00:45:14,068
Thanks, Darren.

884
00:45:14,172 --> 00:45:16,413
All right. The board is already
in the conference room.

885
00:45:16,517 --> 00:45:17,896
You don't have much time.

886
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,068
James is ready to start.

887
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:25,034
This should be a quick
and easy meeting.

888
00:45:25,137 --> 00:45:26,862
James is going
to discuss projections

889
00:45:26,931 --> 00:45:28,458
and financials for
the upcoming quarter.

890
00:45:28,482 --> 00:45:30,379
That's it.

891
00:45:30,482 --> 00:45:32,379
Okay.

892
00:45:32,482 --> 00:45:34,482
Don't worry.

893
00:45:34,551 --> 00:45:36,034
You got this.

894
00:45:41,655 --> 00:45:43,724
- Good morning.
- Yeah.

895
00:46:18,551 --> 00:46:22,482
So, what will we
be discussing today?

896
00:46:22,586 --> 00:46:25,310
Uh, yes. Uh, well, I know

897
00:46:25,413 --> 00:46:27,689
were talking...

898
00:46:27,724 --> 00:46:29,724
for the upcoming semester...

899
00:46:29,758 --> 00:46:31,137
Quarter.

900
00:46:31,241 --> 00:46:33,965
That's right!
Quarter.

901
00:46:34,068 --> 00:46:35,862
And, uh...

902
00:46:35,896 --> 00:46:37,551
it looks like, were doing well!

903
00:46:37,586 --> 00:46:40,206
And we are gonna
keep doing well!

904
00:46:40,241 --> 00:46:41,827
And so...

905
00:46:41,931 --> 00:46:44,551
I don't see any reason
why anyone should worry.

906
00:46:44,620 --> 00:46:47,068
- Amen!
- Not amen.

907
00:46:47,103 --> 00:46:49,827
James, why don't you lead
for this meeting

908
00:46:49,931 --> 00:46:53,931
just to give Anna enough time
to get used to our formats.

909
00:46:54,034 --> 00:46:55,551
Gladly.

910
00:46:55,586 --> 00:46:58,551
If everyone could open up
their prospectus...

911
00:46:58,586 --> 00:47:01,965
to the second quarter,
page two please.

912
00:47:03,827 --> 00:47:05,793
Anna, a word before you go.

913
00:47:05,827 --> 00:47:08,827
Your uncle had huge plans
for this company.

914
00:47:08,896 --> 00:47:11,689
And as we all know, this type of
work isn't meant for everyone.

915
00:47:11,793 --> 00:47:13,793
So, if it's too much,

916
00:47:13,827 --> 00:47:15,689
I can get Brian
to transfer your shares

917
00:47:15,793 --> 00:47:17,827
over to Janet and I right now.

918
00:47:17,931 --> 00:47:19,310
You really should walk away

919
00:47:19,344 --> 00:47:21,344
before you embarrass
yourself any further.

920
00:47:33,448 --> 00:47:35,034
Anna.

921
00:47:35,137 --> 00:47:36,862
I know.
I'm not cut out for this.

922
00:47:36,965 --> 00:47:39,655
That's not what I was
going to say at all.

923
00:47:46,344 --> 00:47:47,793
Let me take you under my wing

924
00:47:47,827 --> 00:47:49,620
and show you the ropes.

925
00:47:50,965 --> 00:47:53,241
I wanna help you reach
your full potential.

926
00:47:56,448 --> 00:47:57,965
Thank you, Janet.

927
00:47:58,034 --> 00:47:59,310

Darren! What are you doing here?

946
00:49:15,413 --> 00:49:17,068
I've been trying to reach you.

947
00:49:17,103 --> 00:49:18,734
Kendra said you didn't
come home after work

948
00:49:18,758 --> 00:49:20,448
and suggested
I come check on you.

949
00:49:20,551 --> 00:49:22,586
I was worried.

950
00:49:22,620 --> 00:49:25,758
I've been very
distracted lately.

951
00:49:26,793 --> 00:49:29,517
Everything is happening so fast.

952
00:49:29,620 --> 00:49:32,793
I can tell your uncle hates
seeing me sitting in that chair.

953
00:49:32,862 --> 00:49:35,620
Maybe he deserves to be
there more than me.

954
00:49:35,655 --> 00:49:37,275
I didn't mean to worry you.

955
00:49:37,310 --> 00:49:38,758
It's okay.

956
00:49:38,793 --> 00:49:40,620
I'm just glad you're all right.

957
00:49:42,551 --> 00:49:45,275
So... what's all this?

958
00:49:46,620 --> 00:49:48,310
Oh, um...

959
00:49:48,413 --> 00:49:52,482
Just a project I'm working on,
but I was about to head out.

960
00:49:52,586 --> 00:49:54,413
You heading back to the mansion?

961
00:49:54,482 --> 00:49:55,931
I'm not sure.

962
00:49:55,965 --> 00:49:58,931
As big as that house is,
I still feel suffocated.

963
00:49:59,896 --> 00:50:01,275
I could use a drink.

964
00:50:02,448 --> 00:50:04,448
You wanna join me?

965
00:50:04,551 --> 00:50:06,068
Sure.

966
00:50:06,103 --> 00:50:07,655

973

You mentioned that James
doesn't trust you.

974
00:50:51,931 --> 00:50:53,620
Why do you think that is?

975
00:50:56,103 --> 00:50:59,275
It's always been that way.

976
00:51:01,034 --> 00:51:03,206
Feels like he hates me
sometimes.

977
00:51:07,344 --> 00:51:09,000
So...

978
00:51:09,068 --> 00:51:10,700
You gonna tell me
why you have pictures of

979
00:51:10,724 --> 00:51:12,413
board members
all along your wall?

980
00:51:12,517 --> 00:51:15,172
Don't tell me you're
drawing caricatures.

981
00:51:18,413 --> 00:51:20,000
This is gonna sound ridiculous.

982
00:51:21,620 --> 00:51:23,000
Try me.

983
00:51:23,034 --> 00:51:25,206
Remember that call
you heard me on

984
00:51:25,310 --> 00:51:26,827
with the doctor?

985
00:51:26,896 --> 00:51:30,172
Well, we met the next day...

986
00:51:30,241 --> 00:51:31,344
and...

987
00:51:31,379 --> 00:51:35,482
she was found murdered
shortly after.

988
00:51:35,517 --> 00:51:36,827
Now maybe I'm overthinking it,

989
00:51:36,896 --> 00:51:38,344
but it just feels like

990
00:51:38,413 --> 00:51:41,103
there's something
someone is trying to cover up.

991
00:51:43,241 --> 00:51:45,827
What do you think
there is to cover up?

992
00:51:47,206 --> 00:51:49,310
That's what I'm hoping to
find out.

993
00:51:49,344 --> 00:51:50,724
Hm.

994
00:51:52,241 --> 00:51:54,620
My uncle's put a
lot of trust in me.

995
00:51:54,655 --> 00:51:57,000
And I...

996
00:51:57,068 --> 00:51:59,000
I really don't wanna
mess this up.

997
00:52:04,862 --> 00:52:06,862
I think you're gonna do great.

I didn't mean to scare you.

1024
00:53:52,310 --> 00:53:54,206
But there's something
you need to know.

1025
00:53:54,310 --> 00:53:57,172
I was hired by your uncle
to do an internal investigation.

1026
00:53:57,275 --> 00:53:59,172
I found out that Brian,
the attorney,

1027
00:53:59,275 --> 00:54:01,034
was involved in
illegal transactions

1028
00:54:01,068 --> 00:54:02,586
using your uncle's name.

1029
00:54:02,689 --> 00:54:04,182
I tried to give
this information to Richard

1030
00:54:04,206 --> 00:54:06,344
but he died before I could.

1031
00:54:06,379 --> 00:54:08,896
I was told you were fired
by my uncle.

1032
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:12,103
Richard didn't fire me.
James did.

1033
00:54:12,206 --> 00:54:14,000
Here, let me show you something.

1034
00:54:17,793 --> 00:54:20,827
"I think Richard is on to us.
We need to do something. Fast."

1035
00:54:20,862 --> 00:54:22,517
What the hell is this?

1036
00:54:22,551 --> 00:54:24,838
It's an email exchange between
Brian and an unknown account.

1037
00:54:24,862 --> 00:54:26,320
Where's the rest of it?
You expect me to

1038
00:54:26,344 --> 00:54:27,862
just believe this
out of nowhere?

1039
00:54:27,896 --> 00:54:30,034
No. That's why
I'm giving you this.

1040
00:54:30,103 --> 00:54:32,034
On that flash drive is proof

1041
00:54:32,103 --> 00:54:33,355
that Brian is
working with someone

1042
00:54:33,379 --> 00:54:34,689
that has access to everything,

1043
00:54:34,758 --> 00:54:36,206
including what you just read.

1044
00:54:36,241 --> 00:54:39,068
I was caught downloading
this information and fired

1045
00:54:39,172 --> 00:54:42,172
before I could get all the files
and email exchanges.

1046
00:54:42,206 --> 00:54:43,551
There's a server manager

1047
00:54:43,620 --> 00:54:45,551
that I programmed
to automatically download

1048
00:54:45,655 --> 00:54:47,206
the remaining information.

1049
00:54:47,275 --> 00:54:49,068
All you have to do is plug that

1050
00:54:49,172 --> 00:54:51,827
into any computer directly
connected to the network.

1051
00:54:51,862 --> 00:54:53,689
How do I know I can trust you?

1052
00:54:53,758 --> 00:54:56,172
You can't.
Trust the evidence.

1053
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:03,068
Anna?

1054
00:55:03,103 --> 00:55:04,586
Everything okay?

1055
00:55:06,241 --> 00:55:08,275
Yeah. Everything is fine.

1056
00:55:21,448 --> 00:55:25,068
Damn! Homie has receipts
on everybody.

1057
00:55:25,103 --> 00:55:26,620
Look at this.
More emails.

1058
00:55:26,724 --> 00:55:28,448
And a list of transactions

1059
00:55:28,482 --> 00:55:30,965
in Richard's name
a few weeks before he died.

1060
00:55:31,068 --> 00:55:32,413
A lot of the transactions

1061
00:55:32,448 --> 00:55:34,275
were processed
to an offshore account.

1062
00:55:34,310 --> 00:55:36,630
But there's no name attached to
the accounts. Just numbers.

1063
00:55:36,655 --> 00:55:38,862
Hm. Check this out.

1064
00:55:38,965 --> 00:55:41,931
Looks like he also has a history
of taking down companies.

1065
00:55:41,965 --> 00:55:43,344
This is from ten years ago,

1066
00:55:43,448 --> 00:55:45,448
when your uncle's company
took over your boys.

1067
00:55:45,551 --> 00:55:46,965
James?

1068
00:55:47,068 --> 00:55:48,896
No, he didn't take it over,
it was a merger.

1069
00:55:48,931 --> 00:55:50,517
Not according to this.

1070
00:55:50,620 --> 00:55:52,482
Evidence supports
that Washington Inc.

1071
00:55:52,586 --> 00:55:55,068
Absorbed all controlling
interests of TechNinth,

1072
00:55:55,103 --> 00:55:57,275
thereby forcing the CEO,
James Buchanan,

1073
00:55:57,344 --> 00:55:59,896
to merge all remaining shares
with Washington Inc.

1074
00:55:59,931 --> 00:56:01,551
Since then,
Buchanan now serves on

1075
00:56:01,655 --> 00:56:03,517
the board of directors
for Washington Inc.

1076
00:56:03,551 --> 00:56:06,137
And there's a photo of him
and the homeboy.

1077
00:56:06,172 --> 00:56:08,724
Wait.
That doesn't make any sense.

1078
00:56:11,068 --> 00:56:13,137
Why wouldn't Janet tell me
about that?

1079
00:56:16,551 --> 00:56:20,724
I just didn't want to paint
your uncle in a negative light.

1080
00:56:20,827 --> 00:56:25,482
Richard absorbed as many
small businesses as he could.

1081
00:56:25,517 --> 00:56:29,206
James, unfortunately,
became one of the casualties.

1082
00:56:29,310 --> 00:56:30,862
But what I didn't know was that

1083
00:56:30,931 --> 00:56:34,793
Richard and James made a surety
agreement behind my back,

1084
00:56:34,827 --> 00:56:36,517
which ultimately meant

1085
00:56:36,586 --> 00:56:39,034
that James would take
a position higher than mine.

1086
00:56:39,137 --> 00:56:42,448
Um, Richard
intended to fix this,

1087
00:56:42,482 --> 00:56:45,068
but...

1088
00:56:45,172 --> 00:56:46,689
Uh, here we are.

1089
00:56:48,068 --> 00:56:49,413
Let me assure though,

1090
00:56:49,517 --> 00:56:51,586
I'm still doing everything
in my power

1091
00:56:51,689 --> 00:56:53,517
to make sure
this company stays afloat.

1092
00:56:54,517 --> 00:56:56,689
What made you look into this?

1093
00:56:56,724 --> 00:56:58,862
Well, I wasn't looking into
James's company.

1094
00:56:58,896 --> 00:57:01,586
I was investigating
some other information

1095
00:57:01,620 --> 00:57:04,551
I came across that he just
so happened to be connected to.

1096
00:57:06,896 --> 00:57:08,620
Brian.

1097
00:57:08,724 --> 00:57:11,586
He was making illegal
transactions in my uncle's name.

1098
00:57:11,620 --> 00:57:13,527
And I think he's been embezzling
from the company.

1099
00:57:13,551 --> 00:57:14,965
What?

1100
00:57:15,068 --> 00:57:18,103
And there's a chance James might
be working with Brian, but...

1101
00:57:18,206 --> 00:57:21,413
Okay. These are
major accusation, Anna,

1102
00:57:21,482 --> 00:57:23,413
that have to be addressed.

1103
00:57:23,482 --> 00:57:28,103
Do you have any other evidence
to prove this theory?

1104
00:57:28,172 --> 00:57:32,896
No. But I do know there's enough
information to make a case.

1105
00:57:32,965 --> 00:57:34,724
So, what do we do next?

1106
00:57:36,275 --> 00:57:38,724
Ah, not we, Anna.

1107
00:57:38,793 --> 00:57:40,413
You.

1108
00:57:40,448 --> 00:57:43,103
Being a leader means having to
make difficult decisions.

1109
00:57:43,206 --> 00:57:45,068
By the way...

1110
00:57:45,103 --> 00:57:46,931
Where did you
get this information

1111
00:57:47,034 --> 00:57:48,586
and can you trust them?

1112
00:57:49,931 --> 00:57:51,586
Well, I got it from Carl Lee.

1113
00:57:53,137 --> 00:57:56,103
That guy that chased me
down at the party.

1114
00:57:56,206 --> 00:57:58,206
And you are sure
you can trust him?

1115
00:57:59,758 --> 00:58:00,931
No.

1116
00:58:02,793 --> 00:58:04,793
But I have to trust
my instincts.

1117
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:07,413
Okay.

1118
00:58:08,793 --> 00:58:09,931
I can't believe you told her.

1119
00:58:09,965 --> 00:58:11,655
Relax.

1120
00:58:11,689 --> 00:58:13,320
I'm calling a meeting tomorrow
and everything will be fine.

1121
00:58:13,344 --> 00:58:14,965
I told you not to trust anyone.

1122
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:16,724
I trusted you. I trust Janet.

1123
00:58:16,827 --> 00:58:19,310
Before Richard hired me,
he knew something was happening

1124
00:58:19,379 --> 00:58:20,724
and days after I handed him

1125
00:58:20,827 --> 00:58:24,000
the information,
I was fired and he...

1126
00:58:24,103 --> 00:58:25,344
he died.

1127
00:58:26,551 --> 00:58:27,931
It'd be really convenient

1128
00:58:27,965 --> 00:58:29,862
if he just died on his own,
wouldn't it?

1129
00:58:32,517 --> 00:58:35,034
- What are you gonna do?
- Smoke him out.

1130
00:58:35,137 --> 00:58:36,655
Once Brian realizes
I'm on to him,

1131
00:58:36,689 --> 00:58:38,655
he's gonna run to his contact,
and when he does,

1132
00:58:38,724 --> 00:58:40,517
I'm putting an end
to all of this.

1133
00:58:55,689 --> 00:58:57,586
Hi, everyone.

1134
00:58:57,655 --> 00:58:59,034
What's going on?

1135
00:58:59,137 --> 00:59:01,896
Don't bother sitting.
This won't take long.

1136
00:59:04,344 --> 00:59:05,586
What's this?

1137
00:59:05,689 --> 00:59:07,413
Look familiar?

1138
00:59:07,448 --> 00:59:10,586
These are various transactions
under some of my accounts...

1139
00:59:10,689 --> 00:59:12,379
that I didn't authorize.

1140
00:59:12,448 --> 00:59:13,758
What's going on here?

1141
00:59:13,862 --> 00:59:15,724
Money laundering
is a federal offense.

1142
00:59:15,793 --> 00:59:19,241
You put this entire company
in jeopardy with your actions.

1143
00:59:19,275 --> 00:59:21,527
Brian, I'm terminating your
position with Washington Inc.,

1144
00:59:21,551 --> 00:59:23,689
effective immediately.

1145
00:59:23,758 --> 00:59:25,827
Money laundering?
That's crazy.

1146
00:59:25,896 --> 00:59:28,344
James? Janet?

1147
00:59:32,896 --> 00:59:34,965
You're making a huge mistake.

1148
00:59:35,034 --> 00:59:38,310
No, you made the mistake
thinking we wouldn't find out.

1149
00:59:48,275 --> 00:59:51,758
You can't fire him without
an HR investigation.

1150
00:59:51,793 --> 00:59:53,896
I'm more worried
about the feds than a lawsuit.

1151
00:59:53,931 --> 00:59:57,275
And last I checked,
HR works for me.

1152
00:59:57,379 --> 00:59:58,827
Where did you get
this information?

1153
00:59:58,896 --> 01:00:00,551
It doesn't matter, James.

1154
01:00:00,620 --> 01:00:03,620
Aren't you the CFO?
You should have caught this.

1155
01:00:03,724 --> 01:00:06,931
You should be grateful I stopped
this company from going under

1156
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:08,793
due to your negligence.

1157
01:00:08,862 --> 01:00:11,517
Your father was impulsive
like this, too.

1158
01:00:11,586 --> 01:00:13,172
And look where that got him.

1159
01:00:22,103 --> 01:00:24,068
Do you think I made
the right decision?

1160
01:00:25,827 --> 01:00:28,310
It's not about right or wrong.

1161
01:00:29,689 --> 01:00:32,034
You trusted your intuition,

1162
01:00:32,103 --> 01:00:35,896
did what's best for the company,
and that's all that matters.

1163
01:00:38,344 --> 01:00:40,206
Your uncle would be proud.

1164
01:00:48,965 --> 01:00:50,725
Who does that bitch
think she is, firing you?

1165
01:00:50,758 --> 01:00:52,103
And for what?

1166
01:00:52,206 --> 01:00:54,172
Doesn't matter,
because it's not true.

1167
01:00:54,241 --> 01:00:57,275
Well, whatever you've
got up your sleeve,

1168
01:00:57,379 --> 01:01:00,103
now's the time to use it.

1169
01:01:00,172 --> 01:01:03,379
I definitely won't be letting
them get away with this.

1170
01:01:03,448 --> 01:01:04,931
Them?

1171
01:01:06,137 --> 01:01:07,448
Her!

1172
01:01:07,517 --> 01:01:11,758
Everything fell apart since
that bum ass came to town.

1173
01:01:11,827 --> 01:01:13,827
We need to finish her.

1174
01:01:17,655 --> 01:01:20,241
All right, I'm sorry, okay?

1175
01:01:20,310 --> 01:01:23,172
Is there anything I can do
to make it better?

1176
01:01:25,172 --> 01:01:28,103
As much as I would love to take
this office for one last ride,

1177
01:01:28,172 --> 01:01:30,482
I really need to pack up
and be out of here.

1178
01:01:32,655 --> 01:01:34,413
Okay.

1179
01:01:34,482 --> 01:01:35,827
Well, um...

1180
01:01:35,896 --> 01:01:38,758
how about I stop by
your place and...

1181
01:01:38,827 --> 01:01:40,310
throw on something sexy?

1182
01:01:41,413 --> 01:01:43,310
That sounds great.

1183
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:47,586
Hmm.

1184
01:01:47,655 --> 01:01:49,137
All right.

1185
01:02:08,241 --> 01:02:09,724
Hello?

1186
01:02:12,241 --> 01:02:13,620
Mhm-hm.

1187
01:02:13,689 --> 01:02:15,344
I'm getting my ass out of here.

1188
01:02:23,689 --> 01:02:25,620
What are you doing here?

1189
01:02:25,689 --> 01:02:27,275
Came to rub it in, huh?

1190
01:02:28,482 --> 01:02:29,896
What the hell!

1191
01:02:29,965 --> 01:02:31,379
No, please...

1192
01:03:21,793 --> 01:03:23,586
Afternoon.

1193
01:03:23,655 --> 01:03:25,551
I'm gonna need to ask
you all some questions.

1194
01:03:25,620 --> 01:03:28,586
I'll assume your company has
a representative I can speak to?

1195
01:03:28,620 --> 01:03:30,206
An attorney maybe?

1196
01:03:35,413 --> 01:03:37,241
Oh, okay.

1197
01:03:37,310 --> 01:03:38,793
Um, well,

1198
01:03:38,896 --> 01:03:40,724
can any of you tell me
if there was

1199
01:03:40,793 --> 01:03:43,758
any suspicious activity
here in the last 24 hours?

1200
01:03:43,827 --> 01:03:47,379
Well, his last day of employment
here was yesterday.

1201
01:03:47,448 --> 01:03:49,103
He was here cleaning out
his office,

1202
01:03:49,137 --> 01:03:51,586
so there wasn't
anyone else here.

1203
01:03:51,620 --> 01:03:53,586
That we know of, anyway.

1204
01:03:53,655 --> 01:03:57,068
Okay. Well, when
you've designated a replacement,

1205
01:03:57,137 --> 01:03:58,758
have them reach out to me.

1206
01:03:58,793 --> 01:04:01,103
I'll be in touch.

1207
01:04:01,172 --> 01:04:02,251
- You!
- Victoria, not now...

1208
01:04:02,275 --> 01:04:03,862
No! This is your fault!

1209
01:04:05,137 --> 01:04:06,689
That was for Brian.

1210
01:04:06,758 --> 01:04:08,482
- Hey.
- Get off me!

1211
01:04:08,517 --> 01:04:10,689
Come on. No. No.

1212
01:04:13,172 --> 01:04:14,620
You wanna press charges?

1213
01:04:14,689 --> 01:04:16,344
No. I just want to go home.

1214
01:04:16,413 --> 01:04:17,413
I'm sure you do.

1215
01:04:17,482 --> 01:04:19,931
Hell of a first month
on the job, huh?

1216
01:04:22,034 --> 01:04:24,068
Let's get outta here.

1217
01:04:32,620 --> 01:04:34,820
So, looking at the numbers here
and you have to see if...

1218
01:04:34,862 --> 01:04:37,103
Hey, Anna.
James wants to see you.

1219
01:04:38,379 --> 01:04:40,448
- I'll be right back.
- Yeah.

1220
01:04:46,206 --> 01:04:49,206
Hi, everyone. What's going on?

1221
01:04:49,275 --> 01:04:51,862
Anna, I'm going to ask
you this one time.

1222
01:04:51,965 --> 01:04:54,344
Who was the source
of your information?

1223
01:04:59,551 --> 01:05:01,931
Something tells me you already
know the answer to that.

1224
01:05:01,965 --> 01:05:04,517
Anna, I tried to
give you a shot. I really did.

1225
01:05:04,586 --> 01:05:06,079
But you've proven to be
even more reckless

1226
01:05:06,103 --> 01:05:07,586
than your father and your uncle.

1227
01:05:07,655 --> 01:05:09,103
Excuse me.

1228
01:05:09,206 --> 01:05:10,620
Also because of your actions

1229
01:05:10,689 --> 01:05:13,068
this corporation is
under criminal investigation

1230
01:05:13,103 --> 01:05:16,034
and now, because of you,
a man is dead.

1231
01:05:16,103 --> 01:05:17,586
James, the evidence...

1232
01:05:17,620 --> 01:05:19,862
Came from a man that tried
to blackmail this company

1233
01:05:19,931 --> 01:05:22,131
with information that we
previously determined was false

1234
01:05:22,206 --> 01:05:24,206
after an internal investigation.

1235
01:05:24,275 --> 01:05:26,620
That's who you were getting
your evidence from.

1236
01:05:26,689 --> 01:05:28,596
This doesn't make any sense.
He said he was working...

1237
01:05:28,620 --> 01:05:31,241
He wasn't working
for your uncle, Anna.

1238
01:05:31,275 --> 01:05:32,931
He was working with him.

1239
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:34,172
Anna, before Richard died,

1240
01:05:34,241 --> 01:05:35,793
he was under investigation.

1241
01:05:35,862 --> 01:05:39,034
We suspected he had been moving
shares to overseas accounts,

1242
01:05:39,103 --> 01:05:41,034
but we couldn't prove
anything yet.

1243
01:05:41,103 --> 01:05:42,931
Yes, we had our own suspicions

1244
01:05:43,034 --> 01:05:44,551
we were going to remove him
as CEO

1245
01:05:44,620 --> 01:05:46,251
until we could conclude
our investigation.

1246
01:05:46,275 --> 01:05:48,275
- You're lying.
- I wish I were.

1247
01:05:48,379 --> 01:05:51,275
When Richard died,
we decided to keep it quiet.

1248
01:05:51,379 --> 01:05:54,068
I never wanted you to
find out like this.

1249
01:05:54,103 --> 01:05:56,758
Anna, your actions have
put us all in danger

1250
01:05:56,793 --> 01:05:58,655
and there's no telling
what other consequences

1251
01:05:58,724 --> 01:06:00,034
will come from this, so,

1252
01:06:00,103 --> 01:06:02,793
Anna, we, the board,
have voted and decided

1253
01:06:02,862 --> 01:06:05,482
that due to the impact
of your actions...

1254
01:06:05,517 --> 01:06:07,655
you are hereby
ordered to step down

1255
01:06:07,689 --> 01:06:11,103
as CEO of Washington Inc.
Effective immediately.

1256
01:06:11,172 --> 01:06:12,724
- Wait, what?
- You can't do that.

1257
01:06:12,793 --> 01:06:14,172
We can. And we have.

1258
01:06:14,275 --> 01:06:17,482
Anna, I'm-I'm so sorry.
I had to say something.

1259
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:26,344
It's no wonder my uncle
didn't leave you anything.

1260
01:06:26,413 --> 01:06:28,137
You really can't be trusted.

1261
01:06:28,172 --> 01:06:30,034
Neither of you.

1262
01:06:56,931 --> 01:06:58,172
- Hello?
- Girl.

1263
01:06:58,241 --> 01:06:59,793
Turn on the news.

1264
01:07:02,034 --> 01:07:04,068
In other news, authorities

1265
01:07:04,172 --> 01:07:07,551
have arrested 32-year-old
Victoria Washington,

1266
01:07:07,586 --> 01:07:09,517
widow of recently deceased

1267
01:07:09,586 --> 01:07:12,551
Washington Inc. CEO,
Richard Washington,

1268
01:07:12,586 --> 01:07:15,655
as a suspect in the killing
of Brian Lancaster,

1269
01:07:15,724 --> 01:07:18,827
whose body was discovered
inside the corporate offices

1270
01:07:18,896 --> 01:07:20,586
of Washington Inc.

1271
01:07:20,655 --> 01:07:23,551
After the murder weapon was
discovered in her vehicle...

1272
01:07:23,586 --> 01:07:25,068
See! I knew
that bitch was crazy.

1273
01:07:25,137 --> 01:07:26,931
Just hours before his murder,

1274
01:07:27,034 --> 01:07:29,793
Lancaster had been fired
by Washington Inc.'s

1275
01:07:29,862 --> 01:07:32,206
newcomer CEO, Anna Washington...

1276
01:07:32,275 --> 01:07:34,689
Hm, they could have
used a better picture of you.

1277
01:07:34,758 --> 01:07:37,103
- Kendra, I gotta go.
- Wait, girl...

1278
01:07:55,689 --> 01:07:57,655
No, ah!

1279
01:07:59,896 --> 01:08:02,275
Every time this game.

1280
01:08:11,310 --> 01:08:13,103
Come on, come on, come on.

1281
01:08:56,931 --> 01:08:59,103
Forget it. I'm going over there.

1282
01:09:50,275 --> 01:09:51,655
Carl?

1283
01:09:52,448 --> 01:09:54,172
Carl!

1284
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:09,689
What do we got?

1285
01:10:15,034 --> 01:10:18,379
Ms. Washington, you and I
are overdue for a talk.

1286
01:10:18,448 --> 01:10:19,862
Once again, I have a dead body

1287
01:10:19,896 --> 01:10:22,310
and you're the last
person seen with them.

1288
01:10:22,379 --> 01:10:23,620
What are you saying?

1289
01:10:23,689 --> 01:10:25,103
I'm saying,
unless you can provide

1290
01:10:25,172 --> 01:10:26,724
some solid answers and alibis,

1291
01:10:26,827 --> 01:10:28,527
I'm gonna have to take
you down to the station

1292
01:10:28,551 --> 01:10:29,827
for additional questioning.

1293
01:10:29,862 --> 01:10:32,172
Why would I need alibis?

1294
01:10:32,206 --> 01:10:33,827
Am I a suspect?

1295
01:10:33,896 --> 01:10:36,206
Not yet, but you're
a person of interest.

1296
01:10:36,275 --> 01:10:37,827
Like I mentioned
in my statement,

1297
01:10:37,862 --> 01:10:39,620
I found Carl like this.

1298
01:10:39,689 --> 01:10:41,609
So what other questions
would you have to ask me?

1299
01:10:41,655 --> 01:10:43,275
For starters, why do people

1300
01:10:43,344 --> 01:10:45,034
at your company
keep ending up dead?

1301
01:10:45,103 --> 01:10:47,827
And why you seem to be
at the center of it.

1302
01:10:49,172 --> 01:10:50,689
Anna, I need to know.

1303
01:10:50,724 --> 01:10:54,034
Is there anyone else you think
could be in danger?

1304
01:10:55,862 --> 01:10:58,482
Hey, Anna. It's me.

1305
01:10:58,551 --> 01:11:02,862
Um, I feel really horrible
about what happened earlier.

1306
01:11:02,931 --> 01:11:05,275
I just, I want you to know
I understand

1307
01:11:05,379 --> 01:11:07,000
how you feel and, um...

1308
01:11:08,448 --> 01:11:10,448
hope this doesn't change
things between us.

1309
01:11:10,551 --> 01:11:11,827
I mean, I'd actually still like

1310
01:11:11,896 --> 01:11:14,620
to be there for you
if you'll let me.

1311
01:11:14,689 --> 01:11:17,517
So, just, um, give me
a call when you can.

1312
01:11:31,931 --> 01:11:34,172
And then he told me
to not leave town!

1313
01:11:34,241 --> 01:11:36,310
What? Girl, bye!

1314
01:11:38,034 --> 01:11:40,620
Carl was on to something and...

1315
01:11:40,689 --> 01:11:42,389
I'm still convinced
Brian wasn't working alone.

1316
01:11:42,413 --> 01:11:43,965
But whoever he was working with

1317
01:11:44,034 --> 01:11:47,000
killed him and possibly killed
my uncle to cover this up

1318
01:11:47,068 --> 01:11:49,103
and I could be next.

1319
01:11:49,206 --> 01:11:51,586
But we can get all the proof
we need with this.

1320
01:11:53,241 --> 01:11:55,103
"We?"

1321
01:11:55,172 --> 01:11:56,655
Are you sure about this?

1322
01:11:57,862 --> 01:11:59,724
Well, no, but...

1323
01:11:59,758 --> 01:12:01,344
I'm sure my uncle was set up.

1324
01:12:01,413 --> 01:12:03,931
And this is the only way
to find out.

1325
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:05,620
Girl, why I always gotta be
caught up

1326
01:12:05,655 --> 01:12:07,896
in your Shelby Woo mess?

1327
01:12:10,310 --> 01:12:12,000
Fine.

1328
01:12:12,103 --> 01:12:13,620
Where we going?

1329
01:12:16,275 --> 01:12:17,655
Ohh!

1330
01:12:18,586 --> 01:12:19,758
I know you lyin'!

1331
01:12:19,827 --> 01:12:21,310
I'll be in and out! I promise!

1332
01:12:21,344 --> 01:12:22,827
We both know that's a damn lie.

1333
01:12:22,896 --> 01:12:25,172
How do you plan on getting in?

1334
01:12:25,241 --> 01:12:28,000
They are not gonna deactivate
until tomorrow morning.

1335
01:12:29,413 --> 01:12:30,862
Shh, it's Darren!

1336
01:12:30,931 --> 01:12:32,655
Don't answer it,
don't answer it. No!

1337
01:12:32,689 --> 01:12:34,344
- Hey, you.
- Hey!

1338
01:12:34,448 --> 01:12:36,758
I just saw the news
and wanted to check on you.

1339
01:12:36,827 --> 01:12:38,620
Aw, you're sweet.
I'm fine, really.

1340
01:12:38,655 --> 01:12:40,344
You sure?

1341
01:12:40,448 --> 01:12:42,344
I can come over later,
if you want.

1342
01:12:42,413 --> 01:12:44,827
Um, sure. That would be great.

1343
01:12:44,931 --> 01:12:46,344
Okay.

1344
01:12:46,413 --> 01:12:47,758
Are you home right now?

1345
01:12:47,827 --> 01:12:50,793
I-I have to go.
Kendra's calling me.

1346
01:12:50,862 --> 01:12:53,103
Okay, we don't have a
lot of time. It's now or never.

1347
01:12:53,172 --> 01:12:55,620
Anna, this is crazy.
You don't work here no more.

1348
01:12:55,689 --> 01:12:58,241
This is breaking the law
and you're trespassing.

1349
01:12:58,310 --> 01:12:59,689
When you got to jail, I can

1350
01:12:59,758 --> 01:13:01,827
still live in the mansion,
right?

1351
01:13:01,896 --> 01:13:04,379
Just checking. I had to ask.
Okay.

1352
01:13:04,482 --> 01:13:05,965
Okay, bye.

1353
01:13:06,034 --> 01:13:07,482
Hurry up!

1354
01:14:51,310 --> 01:14:53,896
Bitch, run!
Come on!

1355
01:14:53,965 --> 01:14:55,137
Come here, come!

1356
01:14:55,241 --> 01:14:56,758
Go, go, go, go!

1357
01:14:56,827 --> 01:14:58,307
- Here we go! I'm going.
- Go, go, go!

1358
01:15:04,862 --> 01:15:06,896
Okay. Now, let's find out
who's name

1359
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:09,275
is linked to all those
transactions we saw before.

1360
01:15:11,310 --> 01:15:14,206
This too much! How do you narrow
it down to the one person?

1361
01:15:14,241 --> 01:15:17,758
There has to be a database that
matches a name to one of these.

1362
01:15:17,827 --> 01:15:19,689
Can you search by name?

1363
01:15:22,793 --> 01:15:25,206
Look, transaction
records from Brian,

1364
01:15:25,310 --> 01:15:27,182
but they don't match
the IP address of his computer.

1365
01:15:27,206 --> 01:15:29,493
Which means these emails didn't
originate from his account.

1366
01:15:29,517 --> 01:15:32,000
That means the attorney was...

1367
01:15:32,034 --> 01:15:33,103
Innocent.

1368
01:15:34,793 --> 01:15:37,172
So, Brian was set up?
By who?

1369
01:15:43,034 --> 01:15:44,310
Nothing.

1370
01:15:44,379 --> 01:15:45,620
I-I-I don't understand...

1371
01:15:45,689 --> 01:15:47,620
Run that back!
Ain't nobody that clean!

1372
01:15:50,758 --> 01:15:52,517
No. James is clear.

1373
01:15:52,551 --> 01:15:54,206
What about your girl?

1374
01:15:54,275 --> 01:15:55,344
Janet?

1375
01:15:55,379 --> 01:15:57,000
There's no way.

1376
01:16:04,689 --> 01:16:06,482
Damn. Guess not.

1377
01:16:06,551 --> 01:16:07,724
So, who's left?

1378
01:16:07,758 --> 01:16:09,896
Maybe someone else on the board?

1379
01:16:09,965 --> 01:16:12,172
You never know when you're
dealin' with the opps.

1380
01:16:12,241 --> 01:16:14,344
It could be anyone.

1381
01:16:14,413 --> 01:16:17,000
I'll give these files to
Detective Briggs in the morning

1382
01:16:17,068 --> 01:16:18,482
and let him figure it out.

1383
01:16:18,551 --> 01:16:20,206
That's a good idea.

1384
01:16:20,275 --> 01:16:22,413
Well, this has been fun.

1385
01:16:22,448 --> 01:16:24,758
I'm going to bed.

1386
01:16:24,793 --> 01:16:28,034
Yeah, I guess I should
go to bed, too.

1387
01:16:47,241 --> 01:16:48,689
No.

1388
01:16:50,896 --> 01:16:52,931
- Hey!
- Hey.

1389
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:54,137
You.

1390
01:16:56,275 --> 01:16:58,344
Everything good?

1391
01:16:58,413 --> 01:17:00,103
Yeah. Why?

1392
01:17:01,827 --> 01:17:03,655
Just checking.

1393
01:17:03,758 --> 01:17:05,655
I called you, but...

1394
01:17:05,758 --> 01:17:07,137
it went to voicemail.

1395
01:17:08,413 --> 01:17:10,724
Yeah, my-my phone died.

1396
01:17:12,793 --> 01:17:14,413
Let's go to bed.

1397
01:17:19,724 --> 01:17:21,137
Come on.

1398
01:17:22,655 --> 01:17:23,655
Let's go.

1399
01:17:55,655 --> 01:17:57,034
Goodnight.

1400
01:17:58,275 --> 01:18:00,103
Goodnight, Darren.

1401
01:19:15,586 --> 01:19:16,689
Shh!

1402
01:19:16,758 --> 01:19:18,103
Anna?
What's going on?

1403
01:19:18,137 --> 01:19:19,631
I don't have time to explain.
I need you

1404
01:19:19,655 --> 01:19:21,389
to call the police and
meet us out front. Hurry.

1405
01:19:21,413 --> 01:19:22,724
Okay.

1406
01:19:51,379 --> 01:19:52,793
Kendra!

1407
01:19:54,206 --> 01:19:55,344
Kendra.

1408
01:19:56,517 --> 01:19:58,172
Kendra, wake up!

1409
01:20:02,896 --> 01:20:04,965
- The hell! What's wrong, girl?
- Shh!

1410
01:20:05,034 --> 01:20:07,241
- We have to get outta here!
- And go where?

1411
01:20:07,310 --> 01:20:09,217
Girl, ain't nothin' open
but legs and liquor stores!

1412
01:20:09,241 --> 01:20:11,241
- It's Darren!
- What about him?

1413
01:20:11,310 --> 01:20:14,310
- He's the one!
- You sure?

1414
01:20:14,379 --> 01:20:16,517
Yes! Get dressed
and I'll explain.

1415
01:20:16,586 --> 01:20:18,137
Come along.

1416
01:20:18,206 --> 01:20:19,448
Dammit!

1417
01:20:22,586 --> 01:20:24,758
- What about Emily?
- She's meeting us outside.

1418
01:20:24,793 --> 01:20:27,344
Um. You sure about that?

1419
01:20:27,413 --> 01:20:28,413
No.

1420
01:20:28,448 --> 01:20:30,517
- Anna, wait...
- Let go of me.

1421
01:20:32,724 --> 01:20:34,379
Aww, damn!

1422
01:20:34,448 --> 01:20:36,275
Oh! Oh!

1423
01:20:58,620 --> 01:20:59,965
Ah!

1424
01:21:04,517 --> 01:21:06,344
You dropped something...

1425
01:21:06,413 --> 01:21:08,862
at the office.

1426
01:21:08,965 --> 01:21:10,965
James? Where's Kendra?

1427
01:21:11,034 --> 01:21:14,655
You just couldn't be... happy,

1428
01:21:14,689 --> 01:21:15,862
could you?

1429
01:21:15,931 --> 01:21:17,655
A big house,

1430
01:21:17,724 --> 01:21:21,344
millions of dollars, and you
didn't have to lift a finger.

1431
01:21:22,862 --> 01:21:25,310
But you just had to have more.

1432
01:21:25,379 --> 01:21:27,551
I tried to keep you safe.

1433
01:21:27,620 --> 01:21:30,827
I didn't want you to end up
like your uncle.

1434
01:21:30,862 --> 01:21:32,586
How could you do this...

1435
01:21:33,586 --> 01:21:34,620
to me?

1436
01:21:34,689 --> 01:21:37,517
You did this to yourself.

1437
01:21:40,034 --> 01:21:42,034
I was just following orders.

1438
01:21:42,103 --> 01:21:44,482
Following orders? From who?

1439
01:21:46,655 --> 01:21:47,862
From me.

1440
01:21:55,620 --> 01:21:57,517
- Janet?
- Yeah.

1441
01:21:59,379 --> 01:22:02,931
And your uncle made a lot of
promises he didn't keep.

1442
01:22:03,034 --> 01:22:05,413
Especially the ones
he made to me.

1443
01:22:05,448 --> 01:22:08,793
So I got rid of him, by putting
Oleander in his whiskey.

1444
01:22:08,896 --> 01:22:12,758
And that's why it didn't show up
in the autopsy report

1445
01:22:12,827 --> 01:22:14,793
you were looking for.

1446
01:22:14,862 --> 01:22:18,241
And-and framing him,
that was even easier,

1447
01:22:18,275 --> 01:22:21,172
using Brian's cloned IP address

1448
01:22:21,241 --> 01:22:24,103
to generate
the overseas transactions.

1449
01:22:24,172 --> 01:22:26,620
Ah, it was perfect.

1450
01:22:26,724 --> 01:22:29,931
But once Darren told me
you were still investigating

1451
01:22:30,034 --> 01:22:32,586
I realized that
I had to move fast,

1452
01:22:32,689 --> 01:22:34,586
even if that meant a few...

1453
01:22:34,655 --> 01:22:36,758
casualties in the process.

1454
01:22:36,793 --> 01:22:39,655
But you did help a sister out
once you fired Brian,

1455
01:22:39,724 --> 01:22:42,655
made him just a easy target!

1456
01:22:42,724 --> 01:22:44,068
Right?

1457
01:22:46,034 --> 01:22:47,586
And here we are.

1458
01:22:49,551 --> 01:22:51,896
However, you did good...

1459
01:22:51,931 --> 01:22:53,448
by bringing us
all of the evidence,

1460
01:22:53,551 --> 01:22:56,275
so the police will never
be able to trace it back to us,

1461
01:22:56,379 --> 01:22:59,379
And for that, we thank you.

1462
01:23:01,758 --> 01:23:04,310
Hm, and when it's all said
and done...

1463
01:23:05,931 --> 01:23:09,896
you'll be the obvious...
scapegoat.

1464
01:23:09,965 --> 01:23:11,724
I mean, you...

1465
01:23:11,793 --> 01:23:13,827
killed your business partner

1466
01:23:13,862 --> 01:23:17,344
and his last blood relative
in a fit of rage

1467
01:23:17,413 --> 01:23:19,241
so you could run the company.

1468
01:23:19,310 --> 01:23:22,000
You know, the headlines
will eat that up, right?

1469
01:23:24,241 --> 01:23:25,827
Hmm.

1470
01:23:25,931 --> 01:23:26,965
And as for you...

1471
01:23:27,068 --> 01:23:28,448
Once you are out of the way,

1472
01:23:28,482 --> 01:23:31,586
then I'll take over
Washington Inc. as CEO...

1473
01:23:31,620 --> 01:23:34,931
and your uncle's legacy
will be ruined forever.

1474
01:23:36,275 --> 01:23:40,275
It's a shame, really.
'Cause I like you, Anna.

1475
01:23:40,379 --> 01:23:41,827
I do.

1476
01:23:43,827 --> 01:23:44,896
I like both of you.

1477
01:23:48,793 --> 01:23:51,517
Thanks for everything, D.

1478
01:23:51,620 --> 01:23:53,655
But I'm gonna, I'm gonna
take it from here.

1479
01:23:53,758 --> 01:23:55,482
Janet, no!

1480
01:23:55,586 --> 01:23:56,655
Shut up!

1481
01:24:19,206 --> 01:24:21,724
Just pull it, Anna.

1482
01:24:21,827 --> 01:24:23,344
This is your moment.

1483
01:24:25,344 --> 01:24:27,137
Do it for your uncle.

1484
01:24:31,551 --> 01:24:33,482
Freeze! Freeze!

1485
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:40,482
Let me go!

1486
01:24:53,344 --> 01:24:55,793
Thank you so much.

1487
01:25:03,586 --> 01:25:06,137
- What's this?
- Evidence.

1488
01:25:06,241 --> 01:25:07,793
They were draining the company.

1489
01:25:07,896 --> 01:25:11,206
Moving money overseas and trying
to frame my uncle and Brian.

1490
01:25:12,241 --> 01:25:13,724
Money laundering, too?

1491
01:25:14,758 --> 01:25:15,862
Where'd you get this?

1492
01:25:15,896 --> 01:25:17,793
Carl Lee gave it to me.

1493
01:25:17,896 --> 01:25:20,448
Before he... you know.

1494
01:25:20,551 --> 01:25:23,275
You just made my job
a lot easier.

1495
01:25:23,379 --> 01:25:25,448
Thank you, I'll be in touch.

1496
01:25:30,068 --> 01:25:31,758
What'd you have on me
on that thing?

1497
01:25:31,862 --> 01:25:34,862
Ha! Surprisingly, nothing.

1498
01:25:36,862 --> 01:25:38,206
Huh...

1499
01:25:39,793 --> 01:25:41,241
Losing my company

1500
01:25:41,310 --> 01:25:44,103
was one of the hardest things
that I've ever done.

1501
01:25:44,206 --> 01:25:46,206
Hundreds lost their jobs...

1502
01:25:47,931 --> 01:25:51,206
but your uncle made sure
all of us were taken care of.

1503
01:25:53,965 --> 01:25:55,379
We didn't always see eye to eye.

1504
01:25:55,413 --> 01:25:58,172
But I respected him
tremendously.

1505
01:25:59,896 --> 01:26:01,793
And I hope he knew that.

1506
01:26:04,137 --> 01:26:06,344
Thank you for clearing his name.

1507
01:26:10,482 --> 01:26:13,655
I'll speak with the board
first thing to make sure...

1508
01:26:13,758 --> 01:26:15,310
that you are reinstated.

1509
01:26:16,310 --> 01:26:17,862
Thank you.

1510
01:26:28,137 --> 01:26:30,206
I was so scared
you were dead, Ken.

1511
01:26:30,310 --> 01:26:31,896
Bitch, me too!

1512
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:35,034
But I came back like the
Undertaker on y'all's ass!

1513
01:26:35,137 --> 01:26:37,217
While y'all were talkin',
I was able to call the cops

1514
01:26:37,310 --> 01:26:38,655
and get them here.

1515
01:26:40,103 --> 01:26:42,517
I guess that means ya girl
Victoria is off the hook.

1516
01:26:42,620 --> 01:26:45,241
Wish I could see her face
when they let her out.

1517
01:26:46,724 --> 01:26:50,310
The next time yo ass gets rich,
I'm staying home.

1518
01:26:50,379 --> 01:26:52,137
No, you know you lying.

1519
01:26:52,172 --> 01:26:56,103
Besides, I don't have any more
family you have to worry about.

1520
01:26:56,137 --> 01:26:57,620
Good. Keep it that way.

1521
01:26:59,137 --> 01:27:01,344
Hm, girl, look at his fine ass.

1522
01:27:01,413 --> 01:27:03,827
I-I-I gotta go.

1523
01:27:03,862 --> 01:27:05,586
