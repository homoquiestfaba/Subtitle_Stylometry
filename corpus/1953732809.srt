1
00:00:04,839 --> 00:00:07,406
It's the comedy central roast of denis leary

2
00:00:07,841 --> 00:00:10,877
Hosted by jeff garlin.

3
00:00:10,912 --> 00:00:13,479
With...

4
00:01:12,906 --> 00:01:15,508
And music by...

5
00:01:19,846 --> 00:01:21,581
Please welcome a man who spent
The last five hours

6
00:01:21,616 --> 00:01:23,749
Getting into
A prosthetic fat suit.

7
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:25,918
Your host for this evening,
Jeff garlin.

8
00:01:38,064 --> 00:01:40,232
Hello, and good evening,
Everybody.

9
00:01:40,667 --> 00:01:44,570
welcome to the comedy central
Roast of denis leary.

10
00:01:48,475 --> 00:01:51,042
Uh, a few announcements.

11
00:01:51,077 --> 00:01:54,547
First off,
Nipsey russell has cancelled.

12
00:01:54,582 --> 00:01:56,715
My apologies.

13
00:01:56,716 --> 00:02:00,619
Unfortunately,
Colin quinn didn't.

14
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:02,320
You know what?

15
00:02:02,355 --> 00:02:05,391
With none of that in mind,
Please take a look at this.

16
00:02:05,426 --> 00:02:08,861
Please welcome denis leary.

17
00:02:11,464 --> 00:02:13,199
I'm not happy,
I'm not happy.

18
00:02:13,234 --> 00:02:14,066
Nobody's happy, okay?

19
00:02:14,067 --> 00:02:15,368
Happiness comes in
Small doses, folks.

20
00:02:15,802 --> 00:02:17,537
It's a cigarette or
A chocolate chip cookie

21
00:02:17,572 --> 00:02:18,838
Or a five-second orgasm.

22
00:02:18,873 --> 00:02:20,139
That's it, okay?

23
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:21,441
You come, you eat the cookie,
You smoke the butt,

24
00:02:21,875 --> 00:02:22,742
You go to sleep,
You get up in the morning

25
00:02:22,777 --> 00:02:24,043
And go to fucking work,
Okay?

26
00:02:24,477 --> 00:02:26,645
One word: drugs.

27
00:02:26,646 --> 00:02:27,947
Cocaine, there's a good idea.

28
00:02:28,381 --> 00:02:29,682
I wanna do a drug that
Makes my penis small,

29
00:02:29,717 --> 00:02:30,983
Makes my heart explode,
Makes my nose bleed,

30
00:02:30,984 --> 00:02:32,719
And sucks all my money
Out of the bank.

31
00:02:32,754 --> 00:02:33,551
Can i do that?

32
00:02:33,586 --> 00:02:35,754
I wanna make
This face all night.

33
00:02:35,755 --> 00:02:37,056
I don't do illegal drugs
Anymore.

34
00:02:37,091 --> 00:02:38,357
Now, i just do
The legal drugs.

35
00:02:38,358 --> 00:02:40,093
tonight, i'm on nyquil
And sudafed.

36
00:02:40,527 --> 00:02:42,227
Forget about
Cocaine and heroin.

37
00:02:42,262 --> 00:02:43,997
all you need is nyquil
And sudafed,

38
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:45,731
I'm telling you right now-

39
00:02:45,732 --> 00:02:46,998
You must
Have some cold.

40
00:02:47,033 --> 00:02:49,635
Uh, actually,
It's for my kids.

41
00:02:49,636 --> 00:02:51,371
What kind of massage
Do you want today, dave?

42
00:02:51,406 --> 00:02:54,407
Uh, i was hoping for
Something special.

43
00:02:54,442 --> 00:02:55,673
Upper body?

44
00:02:55,708 --> 00:02:57,009
Yeah, upper body.

45
00:02:57,010 --> 00:02:58,745
And you know, if you feel like
Throwing in some lower body.

46
00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:00,046
I love tits.

47
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,215
I'd like to be the mayor of
Tit town, if i could, okay?

48
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:03,950
I'd like to drive
A big truck full of tits

49
00:03:03,985 --> 00:03:04,817
Down the tit turnpike,

50
00:03:05,251 --> 00:03:06,951
Right into the middle
Of tit town!

51
00:03:06,986 --> 00:03:08,721
Oh, come on, i'm not
A bad-looking guy.

52
00:03:09,589 --> 00:03:10,855
What, what?

53
00:03:10,890 --> 00:03:12,191
You wouldn't do me
If you were gay?

54
00:03:12,192 --> 00:03:14,143
Deep down inside...
Everybody's gay.

55
00:03:14,178 --> 00:03:16,060
This is how it starts,
Probably.

56
00:03:16,095 --> 00:03:17,396
It starts with us
Talking about your gigantic ass

57
00:03:17,397 --> 00:03:18,698
Here in the car and then
In about a month

58
00:03:19,132 --> 00:03:20,398
We're sitting
On a couch somewhere

59
00:03:20,433 --> 00:03:21,734
Holding hands and watching
"The wizard of oz"

60
00:03:21,769 --> 00:03:23,035
On d-v-d wide screen!

61
00:03:23,036 --> 00:03:25,204
I represent angry, gun-toting
Meat-eating people, pal!

62
00:03:26,506 --> 00:03:29,542
I just beat up
Santa claus.

63
00:03:29,577 --> 00:03:31,945
You blind?

64
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:34,313
It's me.

65
00:03:37,784 --> 00:03:39,050
Thank you!

66
00:03:39,085 --> 00:03:42,988
thank you, thank you,
Thank you, and fuck you!

67
00:03:42,989 --> 00:03:44,255
Life sucks.

68
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:46,458
Get a fuckin' helmet,
All right?

69
00:04:09,015 --> 00:04:11,183
Ladies and gentlemen, tonight,
We're not gonna be mean.

70
00:04:11,618 --> 00:04:13,136
Mean is easy.

71
00:04:13,171 --> 00:04:14,654
Mean is cheap.

72
00:04:15,088 --> 00:04:16,606
Anybody can be mean.

73
00:04:16,641 --> 00:04:18,250
You know
Who's mean?

74
00:04:18,285 --> 00:04:19,824
Denis leary is mean.

75
00:04:19,859 --> 00:04:22,860
That's easy,
We're not going there.

76
00:04:22,895 --> 00:04:24,630
Uh, we're going out to
Over 46 countries,

77
00:04:24,631 --> 00:04:27,016
But oddly enough,
Not in america.

78
00:04:27,051 --> 00:04:29,401
They don't get
Denis leary here.

79
00:04:29,402 --> 00:04:31,570
But in sweden, for example,
See, i toured with him there.

80
00:04:32,005 --> 00:04:33,271
He's huge!

81
00:04:33,306 --> 00:04:34,572
He's the king of comedy.

82
00:04:34,607 --> 00:04:35,908
You know what they call
Denis in sweden?

83
00:04:36,342 --> 00:04:39,378
Denis leary.

84
00:04:39,379 --> 00:04:41,512
Denis, you do it all.

85
00:04:41,547 --> 00:04:44,149
Denis not only served
As the producer of "the job",

86
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:46,752
But he also produced
The movie "blow".

87
00:04:46,753 --> 00:04:48,488
The job, blow.

88
00:04:48,921 --> 00:04:50,222
All i can tell you
On basic cable

89
00:04:50,657 --> 00:04:51,923
With kids watching

90
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:55,861
Is that denis loves
To get his cock sucked.

91
00:04:55,862 --> 00:04:59,332
Ladies and gentlemen,
Nick dipaolo.

92
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:11,044
Why are we roasting you?

93
00:05:11,079 --> 00:05:12,310
You're irish.

94
00:05:12,345 --> 00:05:16,248
Shouldn't we
Be boiling you?

95
00:05:18,418 --> 00:05:22,321
Put a couple of potatoes
And a carrot behind you.

96
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:25,358
I'm like, "what are
We supposed to wear?"

97
00:05:25,393 --> 00:05:27,093
They said, "think irish wake. "

98
00:05:27,128 --> 00:05:27,960
I'm like,
"Irish wake?"

99
00:05:28,394 --> 00:05:29,261
Well, that's right.

100
00:05:29,262 --> 00:05:30,997
We're celebrating
Denis' career.

101
00:05:31,032 --> 00:05:32,697
That's about right.

102
00:05:32,732 --> 00:05:34,467
Colin quinn's here tonight.

103
00:05:34,502 --> 00:05:37,069
Colin-
Yeah!

104
00:05:37,503 --> 00:05:39,671
a few years ago,
People magazine

105
00:05:39,672 --> 00:05:42,274
Listed the 50 most interesting
People in showbiz,

106
00:05:42,275 --> 00:05:44,443
And they put colin in there.

107
00:05:44,444 --> 00:05:46,179
He came right after
The hairdresser

108
00:05:46,612 --> 00:05:47,913
For "earth, wind and fire"

109
00:05:47,914 --> 00:05:53,119
And right before the guy
Who invented the lobster bib.

110
00:05:55,288 --> 00:05:56,589
lenny clarke,
What, did the bowflex e

111
00:05:57,023 --> 00:05:58,324
Get lost in the mail?

112
00:05:58,359 --> 00:06:01,360
Holy shit.

113
00:06:01,361 --> 00:06:03,529
how can you have a coke problem
And a weight problem?

114
00:06:03,564 --> 00:06:06,149
This is unbelievable.

115
00:06:06,184 --> 00:06:08,734
What are
You snorting?

116
00:06:08,735 --> 00:06:10,036
Confectionery sugar?

117
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:14,373
Jesus christ.

118
00:06:14,374 --> 00:06:16,109
How about a hand
For adam ferrara?

119
00:06:16,144 --> 00:06:19,145
Come on, folks.

120
00:06:21,314 --> 00:06:26,085
He's like tony danza
Without the jokes.

121
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:29,121
We've got
Dr. Dre over there.

122
00:06:29,122 --> 00:06:31,724
Yeah.

123
00:06:32,158 --> 00:06:34,326
I'm just happy to meet
A black guy

124
00:06:34,327 --> 00:06:36,027
Who's got the title
"Doctor" in his name,

125
00:06:36,062 --> 00:06:41,267
Who's not wearing a grass skirt
And a bone through his nose.

126
00:06:46,038 --> 00:06:47,773
Ed lover, i know
Nothing about you, man.

127
00:06:48,207 --> 00:06:51,677
i put you in the fucking-
The yahoo search thing, and...

128
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:55,546
I did!

129
00:06:55,581 --> 00:06:57,749
I put "ed lover"
In the search thing.

130
00:06:58,184 --> 00:07:00,352
I ended up looking at j-pegs
Of teenage, you know,

131
00:07:00,353 --> 00:07:02,304
Cheerleaders
Being pissed on

132
00:07:02,339 --> 00:07:04,256
By a pit bull named
Chuckles.

133
00:07:06,859 --> 00:07:08,594
Kiefer sutherland's here.

134
00:07:13,366 --> 00:07:16,402
i read an article in esquire
Kiefer sutherland did.

135
00:07:16,836 --> 00:07:19,872
He said how he had to sleep
In a car for two years in I.A.

136
00:07:19,907 --> 00:07:21,173
It must have been tough,

137
00:07:21,174 --> 00:07:23,307
tossing and turning
In a mercedes 450 s-I...

138
00:07:23,342 --> 00:07:26,812
When it's parked in front of
Your fucking father's mansion

139
00:07:26,813 --> 00:07:28,981
In hollywood,
That must have been...

140
00:07:35,054 --> 00:07:38,090
He said his dad didn't help him
With his career.

141
00:07:38,125 --> 00:07:41,560
Yeah, and
Tori spelling's an orphan.

142
00:07:45,898 --> 00:07:48,500
And the man of the hour,
Give it up for denis, please.

143
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:55,441
Let's focus
On denis' film career

144
00:07:55,875 --> 00:07:58,911
Since his agent didn't.

145
00:08:01,514 --> 00:08:03,249
People make fun of the one
You did with sandra bullock,

146
00:08:03,284 --> 00:08:04,984
"Two if by sea",
But did anybody see

147
00:08:05,418 --> 00:08:07,586
The other piece of shit
He made, "neon bible"?

148
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:10,622
Yeah, exactly.

149
00:08:10,623 --> 00:08:14,526
This made "two if by sea"
Look like "casablanca", okay?

150
00:08:14,527 --> 00:08:15,793
Me and my wife
Wanted to walk out

151
00:08:15,828 --> 00:08:18,213
Halfway through the film,
We couldn't.

152
00:08:18,248 --> 00:08:20,599
The lines were
Too long at the exit.

153
00:08:23,202 --> 00:08:24,902
"Operation dumbo drop",
Let me ask you,

154
00:08:24,937 --> 00:08:27,756
At what point when
You were reading the script

155
00:08:27,791 --> 00:08:30,575
Did you say, "i have to do this
Fuckin' film?"

156
00:08:32,311 --> 00:08:34,046
Was it when you
Were fighting with ray liotta,

157
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:35,781
Or was it when you were
Strapping a parachute

158
00:08:35,816 --> 00:08:37,082
To an elephant's
Asshole?

159
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:40,084
Is that when it hit?

160
00:08:40,119 --> 00:08:42,287
I understand why
You did the movie.

161
00:08:42,288 --> 00:08:44,023
I mean, it's not every day
You get to work

162
00:08:44,457 --> 00:08:46,625
With the guy
Who wrote "police academy 4".

163
00:08:47,059 --> 00:08:50,529
You've made more bombs in
The last five years than hamas!

164
00:08:52,265 --> 00:08:53,132
Folks, i love denis leary,

165
00:08:53,566 --> 00:08:54,867
He's done
A lot for my career.

166
00:08:54,902 --> 00:08:56,168
Thank you very much, denis!

167
00:09:02,675 --> 00:09:03,941
Hi, there.

168
00:09:03,976 --> 00:09:05,676
I'm television's
Conan o'brien.

169
00:09:05,711 --> 00:09:07,879
I know we're here to roast
Denis leary this evening,

170
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:10,048
But i'm not gonna do that.

171
00:09:10,049 --> 00:09:12,217
I have too much respect
For denis.

172
00:09:12,218 --> 00:09:14,820
You see, unlike most comedians,
Denis has convictions,

173
00:09:14,855 --> 00:09:16,121
Integrity.

174
00:09:16,122 --> 00:09:17,423
In a dishonorable
Business,

175
00:09:17,857 --> 00:09:20,459
He's a man of honor
Who stands for something.

176
00:09:20,494 --> 00:09:22,627
Now, i have more to say
About denis

177
00:09:22,628 --> 00:09:25,230
After this quick message.

178
00:09:25,231 --> 00:09:26,749
You want your car
To last forever, right?

179
00:09:26,784 --> 00:09:28,232
How do you feel about
Friction, tightwad?

180
00:09:28,267 --> 00:09:30,435
This is quaker state higher mileage engine.

181
00:09:30,436 --> 00:09:32,171
Proven to reduce friction,
And condition seals.

182
00:09:32,206 --> 00:09:34,339
We're back.

183
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:36,508
Denis, of course,
Is famous for his anger.

184
00:09:36,943 --> 00:09:38,209
A righteous anger

185
00:09:38,244 --> 00:09:40,412
That he reserves for only
The most deserving of targets.

186
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:43,449
More on denis,
Right after this.

187
00:09:43,883 --> 00:09:45,184
Over time, seals combust.

188
00:09:45,219 --> 00:09:46,884
Hey, hey!

189
00:09:46,919 --> 00:09:49,521
Rings can blow.

190
00:09:50,823 --> 00:09:53,425
Don't forget
Metal-to-metal contact!

191
00:09:53,426 --> 00:09:55,594
And we're back.

192
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:57,763
And denis isn't just a hero
Here in america,

193
00:09:57,798 --> 00:09:59,064
His reach is global,

194
00:09:59,065 --> 00:10:02,535
And his message is
One for all mankind.

195
00:10:08,174 --> 00:10:10,776
So denis,
Here's to you.

196
00:10:10,811 --> 00:10:13,378
Thanks for keeping it real.

197
00:10:23,823 --> 00:10:25,558
Right now, i want
To introduce a fellow

198
00:10:25,593 --> 00:10:27,726
Who's playing roger healy

199
00:10:27,727 --> 00:10:30,329
In the off-broadway production
Of "i dream of jeannie".

200
00:10:30,364 --> 00:10:32,064
Please welcome adam ferrara!

201
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:45,910
Thank you, jeff.

202
00:10:45,945 --> 00:10:47,211
Good to see you
Again.

203
00:10:47,246 --> 00:10:48,946
And congratulations
On all your success.

204
00:10:48,981 --> 00:10:51,149
hbo is doing a spin-off series
Starring jeff.

205
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:53,752
It's called
"Curb your appetite".

206
00:10:58,090 --> 00:10:59,391
Hiya, pal!

207
00:10:59,825 --> 00:11:00,692
Is this great?

208
00:11:00,693 --> 00:11:01,959
Look at this.

209
00:11:01,994 --> 00:11:03,295
The red carpet,
This set,

210
00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:04,596
A kick-ass band.

211
00:11:04,597 --> 00:11:06,765
You are not only
A fine actor and a stand-up,

212
00:11:06,766 --> 00:11:08,032
You're a magician.

213
00:11:08,067 --> 00:11:09,368
Anybody who can get
This kind of money

214
00:11:09,403 --> 00:11:13,271
out of
Fucking comedy central.

215
00:11:13,272 --> 00:11:15,440
Vincent,
Good to see you.

216
00:11:15,875 --> 00:11:18,911
All "the sopranos"
Boys are here.

217
00:11:24,116 --> 00:11:25,417
"The sopranos" boys are here,

218
00:11:25,418 --> 00:11:30,189
And if anybody asks,
They've been here since 4:30.

219
00:11:33,659 --> 00:11:35,827
Robert deniro is not here
This evening

220
00:11:36,262 --> 00:11:41,467
Because he's
Robert fuckin' deniro.

221
00:11:41,901 --> 00:11:43,636
You went from being
In a movie with

222
00:11:43,671 --> 00:11:45,336
Deniro and dustin hoffman,

223
00:11:45,371 --> 00:11:49,708
To doing a t. V. Show
With lenny clarke and me.

224
00:11:49,709 --> 00:11:52,745
next stop, quaker state.

225
00:11:57,083 --> 00:11:59,216
It was
A great show.

226
00:11:59,251 --> 00:12:01,202
I'm talking about, of course,
"The job"

227
00:12:01,237 --> 00:12:03,154
And i gotta thank you
For that gig, chief.

228
00:12:03,589 --> 00:12:06,191
I really do.

229
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:10,962
It was the best
Two weeks of my life.

230
00:12:11,397 --> 00:12:13,348
Really,
Seriously.

231
00:12:13,383 --> 00:12:15,300
Ladies and gentlemen,

232
00:12:15,301 --> 00:12:17,903
I learned so much about my craft
By being on that show,

233
00:12:17,938 --> 00:12:20,505
And watching one
Of the true masters.

234
00:12:20,506 --> 00:12:21,807
I love you too, pal.

235
00:12:22,241 --> 00:12:25,676
Lenny clarke.

236
00:12:25,711 --> 00:12:29,181
How are you, musty?

237
00:12:29,615 --> 00:12:30,482
All right,
Sit down.

238
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:33,518
You're rocking the stage.

239
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:34,820
You were an altar boy,
Right?

240
00:12:35,254 --> 00:12:37,422
No wonder you're so angry.

241
00:12:37,423 --> 00:12:40,459
Show me on kiefer sutherland
Where the priest touched you.

242
00:12:46,098 --> 00:12:49,134
You know why i like
Working with this man?

243
00:12:49,135 --> 00:12:50,835
He's a true leader.

244
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:52,570
I admire
Your self-confidence.

245
00:12:52,605 --> 00:12:54,773
Some perceive it
As severe narcissism,

246
00:12:55,207 --> 00:12:56,508
But not me.

247
00:12:56,509 --> 00:13:02,581
I'm sure a lot of guys jerk off
In front of a mirror...

248
00:13:02,616 --> 00:13:07,352
Backlit...

249
00:13:07,353 --> 00:13:11,690
While an orchestra plays
The "asshole" song.

250
00:13:13,859 --> 00:13:15,594
I've been to denis' farm
Up in connecticut,

251
00:13:16,028 --> 00:13:19,931
Or, as it's commonly known,
The never-glad ranch.

252
00:13:19,932 --> 00:13:22,100
If you ever get a chance
To go to leary world,

253
00:13:22,101 --> 00:13:24,668
Get the three-day pass.

254
00:13:24,703 --> 00:13:27,305
It includes the whiskey
And water slide,

255
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:30,776
20,000 leagues
Under the influence,

256
00:13:30,811 --> 00:13:32,944
Mr. Leary's angry ride,

257
00:13:32,945 --> 00:13:39,451
And my personal favorite,
"It's a small penis after all. "

258
00:13:40,753 --> 00:13:45,055
You really are irish.

259
00:13:45,090 --> 00:13:48,126
But the most impressive thing
About the place is,

260
00:13:48,127 --> 00:13:51,597
he paid for it all
With marlboro miles.

261
00:13:57,236 --> 00:13:59,404
While i was there,
I met his entire family

262
00:13:59,405 --> 00:14:00,706
And there's thousands of them.

263
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:02,840
Packs of nieces
And nephews.

264
00:14:02,875 --> 00:14:08,513
Seven-year-old learys, just
Looking up at you, smoking.

265
00:14:08,514 --> 00:14:09,815
"You like
Spongebob squarepants?

266
00:14:09,850 --> 00:14:11,983
"Yeah?

267
00:14:11,984 --> 00:14:14,586
I think he's a pussy. "

268
00:14:18,057 --> 00:14:19,792
Well, chief, i want you
To know something.

269
00:14:20,226 --> 00:14:25,431
the work you do with
The cam neely foundation.

270
00:14:25,466 --> 00:14:27,599
every year,
The cam neely foundation,

271
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:28,866
"Comics come home".

272
00:14:28,901 --> 00:14:31,069
And your tireless efforts with
The leary firefighters fund,

273
00:14:31,503 --> 00:14:34,973
You, yes.

274
00:14:38,010 --> 00:14:40,612
You're a noble,
Generous man of character...

275
00:14:40,613 --> 00:14:43,180
to them.

276
00:14:43,215 --> 00:14:46,251
To me,
You're a miserable prick.

277
00:14:46,252 --> 00:14:49,288
I love you, now go
Fuck yourself.

278
00:14:58,397 --> 00:15:00,097
Here's the thing.

279
00:15:00,132 --> 00:15:01,867
I directed you in the film
"Lakeboat",

280
00:15:02,301 --> 00:15:04,001
Let me tell you.

281
00:15:04,036 --> 00:15:07,506
I've seen better acting
In a cambodian whorehouse.

282
00:15:07,541 --> 00:15:08,807
Now, listen to what
I'm telling you,

283
00:15:09,241 --> 00:15:11,192
You bloated, alcoholic
Leprechaun,

284
00:15:11,227 --> 00:15:13,144
You get paid
To tell jokes onstage,

285
00:15:13,145 --> 00:15:14,446
But you know what
The biggest joke is?

286
00:15:14,481 --> 00:15:16,181
Your career.

287
00:15:16,615 --> 00:15:18,783
You go from starring
In features,

288
00:15:18,784 --> 00:15:21,386
To starring in
Your own failed sit-com

289
00:15:21,387 --> 00:15:24,423
To being roasted
On basic cable?

290
00:15:24,458 --> 00:15:25,689
That's hilarious.

291
00:15:25,724 --> 00:15:28,760
no, it's fucking
Hilarious.

292
00:15:29,194 --> 00:15:32,664
And you have the balls to call
Yourself a comedian?

293
00:15:32,665 --> 00:15:36,568
Your material's more dated
Than shannen doherty's twat

294
00:15:36,603 --> 00:15:38,736
So why don't you go out
And make another movie

295
00:15:38,737 --> 00:15:40,437
That nobody'll see,

296
00:15:40,472 --> 00:15:42,207
And then down another
Bottle of cheap whiskey?

297
00:15:42,242 --> 00:15:45,677
That's what i'm saying!

298
00:15:59,825 --> 00:16:01,560
please welcome the star
Of comedy central's

299
00:16:01,994 --> 00:16:03,694
"Tough crowd with colin quinn"

300
00:16:03,729 --> 00:16:05,464
And let me just say,
He could be funny tonight.

301
00:16:05,499 --> 00:16:07,632
Seriously.

302
00:16:07,633 --> 00:16:09,801
No, no, no, really,
You never know.

303
00:16:09,802 --> 00:16:13,272
i don't think he's funny,
But he might be tonight.

304
00:16:13,307 --> 00:16:14,538
Who knows?

305
00:16:14,573 --> 00:16:16,091
There's only
One way to find out.

306
00:16:16,126 --> 00:16:17,609
Ladies and gentlemen,
Colin quinn.

307
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:27,152
Thank you very much.

308
00:16:27,586 --> 00:16:28,887
I'm the fourth-biggest
Star here.

309
00:16:28,922 --> 00:16:30,188
Does that bother you?

310
00:16:30,189 --> 00:16:31,455
It should.

311
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:35,827
Now, look-
Oh, this is pathetic.

312
00:16:35,828 --> 00:16:39,731
We got kiefer, liz hurley,
And who is that?

313
00:16:39,732 --> 00:16:42,733
Robert evans' kid?

314
00:16:42,768 --> 00:16:44,468
Throw him up
There, den.

315
00:16:44,503 --> 00:16:46,238
Sit with them, denis,
That's a good idea.

316
00:16:46,672 --> 00:16:47,973
Don't sit with
Your comedian friends.

317
00:16:48,008 --> 00:16:49,673
Sit over here.

318
00:16:49,708 --> 00:16:51,876
But i, um,
I know he's a good friend.

319
00:16:51,877 --> 00:16:54,045
Denis is good friends with
A lot of stars,

320
00:16:54,046 --> 00:16:56,214
Like he's good friends
With sean penn,

321
00:16:56,215 --> 00:16:57,516
Which always bothered me.

322
00:16:57,950 --> 00:16:59,216
I'm sure
It bothers everybody.

323
00:16:59,251 --> 00:17:01,853
I'm sure it bothers nobody
More than it bothers sean penn,

324
00:17:01,854 --> 00:17:04,022
Actually, but-

325
00:17:04,023 --> 00:17:05,289
Now, kiefer sutherland
Is here.

326
00:17:05,324 --> 00:17:07,058
I don't think they ever
Worked together, either.

327
00:17:07,093 --> 00:17:08,793
It's like, i think
Denis called sean and said,

328
00:17:08,794 --> 00:17:10,060
"Hey, man,
I got a roast. "

329
00:17:10,095 --> 00:17:13,565
And he said, "i'll get you
Kiefer, i'm not coming. "

330
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:16,601
You're lucky kiefer
Said yes,

331
00:17:16,602 --> 00:17:18,337
Or i'd be here
Making "mighty ducks" jokes

332
00:17:18,372 --> 00:17:20,072
At emilio estevez.

333
00:17:20,107 --> 00:17:23,542
All right.

334
00:17:25,277 --> 00:17:26,578
See, that's what denis
Has to realize...

335
00:17:26,613 --> 00:17:29,180
That he's a star
To us in comedy,

336
00:17:29,181 --> 00:17:30,916
But to his star friends,
He's not a star.

337
00:17:30,951 --> 00:17:33,084
I saw him
One afternoon coming back

338
00:17:33,085 --> 00:17:35,253
From clint eastwood's house.

339
00:17:35,254 --> 00:17:38,290
And who goes to lunch with a
Pair of pliers in their pocket?

340
00:17:38,325 --> 00:17:39,990
He was fixing stuff
For clint.

341
00:17:40,025 --> 00:17:42,627
I saw him leave
Kevin spacey's house,

342
00:17:42,628 --> 00:17:43,894
He had grease under his nails.

343
00:17:43,929 --> 00:17:45,230
Now, that was
A social call, true-

344
00:17:45,664 --> 00:17:49,099
Oh, boy.

345
00:17:49,134 --> 00:17:51,302
Ooh, inside news.

346
00:17:51,303 --> 00:17:52,569
Denis- the smoking thing,

347
00:17:52,604 --> 00:17:53,905
I think somebody
Was talking about.

348
00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:55,606
And it is kind of
A serious thing.

349
00:17:55,641 --> 00:17:57,809
We all want him
To quit smoking, obviously.

350
00:17:58,243 --> 00:17:59,943
Right?

351
00:17:59,978 --> 00:18:02,580
But they actually took
A chest x-ray.

352
00:18:02,581 --> 00:18:04,749
They took a chest x-ray
Of denis

353
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:06,918
And up on the chart,

354
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:09,521
It was a picture of god
Giving him the finger.

355
00:18:09,955 --> 00:18:12,557
but let's talk about
The company, apostle.

356
00:18:12,592 --> 00:18:14,743
he has a company meeting
At apostle.

357
00:18:14,778 --> 00:18:16,860
Leary, serpico,
And siletti in a bar.

358
00:18:16,895 --> 00:18:18,630
The meeting starts, siletti
Talks about the budget.

359
00:18:19,064 --> 00:18:20,365
After 10 seconds,
Leary interrupts,

360
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,100
Says he wants a cigarette,

361
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:24,234
And he can't believe
He can't smoke in a bar.

362
00:18:24,269 --> 00:18:26,437
Then they look at a script
That was written by leary,

363
00:18:26,438 --> 00:18:30,775
Peter tolan,
Two firemen on bar napkins.

364
00:18:30,776 --> 00:18:32,944
They get bored, so they drive
Over to the gym

365
00:18:32,945 --> 00:18:35,113
Where lenny has
Just worn down the brakes

366
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:38,549
Off another elliptical machine.

367
00:18:38,584 --> 00:18:40,319
When lenny presses
The heart rate monitor,

368
00:18:40,752 --> 00:18:46,390
A picture of john candy waving
To him comes up.

369
00:18:46,391 --> 00:18:49,861
No!

370
00:18:50,295 --> 00:18:52,463
In 1987, this is true.

371
00:18:52,464 --> 00:18:54,632
Lenny used to do a little,
Well, you know-

372
00:18:54,633 --> 00:18:56,333
We don't say that-
But the drugs.

373
00:18:56,368 --> 00:18:58,970
Lenny got a handwritten
Thank-you note

374
00:18:58,971 --> 00:19:01,972
From pablo escobar, all right?

375
00:19:02,007 --> 00:19:08,513
Then, they pick up adam ferrara,
Who's in the steam room

376
00:19:08,514 --> 00:19:10,682
Doing one of his bits for
A 70-year-old russian immigrant

377
00:19:10,717 --> 00:19:12,850
That doesn't speak english.

378
00:19:12,851 --> 00:19:14,152
Adam's one of those guys
That does his bits

379
00:19:14,586 --> 00:19:15,887
While he talks to you.

380
00:19:15,888 --> 00:19:18,056
It's like robin williams, only
You don't have to be polite,

381
00:19:18,091 --> 00:19:21,526
Because he can't hurt you
In the business, you know?

382
00:19:21,527 --> 00:19:23,227
And you've got nick dipaolo.

383
00:19:23,262 --> 00:19:25,829
He burns bridges
While he's crossing them.

384
00:19:25,864 --> 00:19:28,466
He's the only comedian that
Heckles the crowd, you know?

385
00:19:28,467 --> 00:19:31,503
You've got ed, dr. Dre
And ed lover over there.

386
00:19:31,538 --> 00:19:32,370
They were the original

387
00:19:32,804 --> 00:19:34,539
"Yo! M-t-v raps" guys,
You know?

388
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:37,541
They brought black culture
Into white suburbs.

389
00:19:37,576 --> 00:19:38,877
They're the guys to blame
When your daughter comes home,

390
00:19:38,912 --> 00:19:42,780
And says, "daddy, this is
Antonio mcdyess. "

391
00:19:42,781 --> 00:19:47,552
Um, when you come
Home early from work,

392
00:19:47,553 --> 00:19:48,854
And your daughter's
Standing there

393
00:19:49,288 --> 00:19:50,554
In just a trailblazers jersey,

394
00:19:50,589 --> 00:19:53,625
eating a bowl of fruity pebbles
With rasheed wallace,

395
00:19:53,660 --> 00:19:55,793
These are
The son of a bitches you can blame.

396
00:19:58,397 --> 00:20:00,097
Um, well, that's about it,
Denis.

397
00:20:00,132 --> 00:20:02,300
I love you,
I've known you a long time.

398
00:20:02,301 --> 00:20:03,602
You're a great guy,
And thank you.

399
00:20:04,036 --> 00:20:07,072
That's it,
Thanks, folks.

400
00:20:16,181 --> 00:20:17,482
Good evening.

401
00:20:17,916 --> 00:20:19,217
I don't wish to add
To the verbal assaults

402
00:20:19,218 --> 00:20:21,386
Already fired upon my friend,
Denis leary,

403
00:20:21,421 --> 00:20:24,422
But i will give you
My take on denis.

404
00:20:24,856 --> 00:20:27,024
See, most people
Are scared of denis.

405
00:20:27,025 --> 00:20:29,193
They find him intimidating
And ill-tempered.

406
00:20:29,194 --> 00:20:30,460
Not so.

407
00:20:30,495 --> 00:20:32,230
The denis i know
Is a sweetie pie.

408
00:20:32,231 --> 00:20:33,931
Look into his eyes
As i have,

409
00:20:33,966 --> 00:20:36,568
And tell me you don't see
A tortured saint.

410
00:20:36,603 --> 00:20:39,170
And that hair,
The color of ripening wheat.

411
00:20:39,171 --> 00:20:41,339
Have you ever looked at denis'
Hands?

412
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:43,508
How can a man's hands
Be so lovely?

413
00:20:43,543 --> 00:20:45,676
I'll tell you how.

414
00:20:45,677 --> 00:20:47,377
He puts makeup on them.

415
00:20:47,412 --> 00:20:49,580
They don't need makeup,
But that's denis.

416
00:20:49,581 --> 00:20:53,484
So if you think denis is mean,
Ask yourself...

417
00:20:53,485 --> 00:20:56,920
Would a mean man
Use hand makeup?

418
00:20:56,955 --> 00:20:59,557
And so, denis, i am honored
To be here to honor you.

419
00:20:59,992 --> 00:21:05,197
Don't let them be too mean,
You delicious mush puff.

420
00:21:05,232 --> 00:21:07,799
I'll give you a big hug.

421
00:21:18,944 --> 00:21:21,546
You know, the building,
This building is, of course,

422
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:23,281
Named after
Oscar hammerstein,

423
00:21:23,282 --> 00:21:25,016
Who wrote
"The sound of music",

424
00:21:25,051 --> 00:21:26,751
"Carousel", and
"The king and i".

425
00:21:26,752 --> 00:21:28,920
Wait, i'd better stop with
The broadway musicals

426
00:21:29,354 --> 00:21:30,655
Before mario cantone

427
00:21:30,656 --> 00:21:34,126
Completely lets loose
With the jizz.

428
00:21:35,427 --> 00:21:37,162
You know who's really been
A great sport tonight,

429
00:21:37,596 --> 00:21:38,862
Do you have any idea?

430
00:21:38,897 --> 00:21:41,499
He's been so wonderful,
So forgiving.

431
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:44,536
The language has been,
You know, uproarious,

432
00:21:44,571 --> 00:21:46,704
If you can describe
Language that way.

433
00:21:46,705 --> 00:21:48,405
But you have been wonderful.

434
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:53,211
Please welcome denis' priest,
Father don gavin.

435
00:22:01,019 --> 00:22:02,754
Well,
Thank you, thank you.

436
00:22:03,188 --> 00:22:04,454
This is tough company,

437
00:22:04,489 --> 00:22:06,657
Watching all
These professional comedians

438
00:22:07,092 --> 00:22:09,260
Attempting to be funny.

439
00:22:09,695 --> 00:22:12,297
And uh,
God does forgive.

440
00:22:12,731 --> 00:22:15,767
He doesn't forget,
But he does forgive.

441
00:22:16,201 --> 00:22:17,936
He's all seeing,
All knowing.

442
00:22:18,370 --> 00:22:21,406
He knows when you're sleeping,
And he knows when you're awake.

443
00:22:21,441 --> 00:22:24,442
He knows when
You've been bad or good.

444
00:22:24,876 --> 00:22:27,912
I could quote the scriptures
Forever.

445
00:22:27,947 --> 00:22:30,948
But i have been
A priest for 30 years.

446
00:22:30,949 --> 00:22:32,684
I'm not a particularly
Religious man, but-

447
00:22:32,719 --> 00:22:37,021
No, i'm serious.

448
00:22:37,022 --> 00:22:43,528
I became a priest 'cause
I'm lazy is what it is.

449
00:22:43,563 --> 00:22:45,696
I got tired
Of chasing the chicks,

450
00:22:46,131 --> 00:22:47,866
And not getting them.

451
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:51,336
So that's why
I'm doing what i do now

452
00:22:51,371 --> 00:22:53,504
And i have my problems,
I drink.

453
00:22:53,505 --> 00:22:56,107
I drink when the-
When i'm awake.

454
00:22:56,108 --> 00:23:00,410
And i'm gambling
Because of this man.

455
00:23:00,445 --> 00:23:03,915
I went to see him at foxwoods,
The indian resort.

456
00:23:03,950 --> 00:23:05,216
I went down there.

457
00:23:05,217 --> 00:23:06,518
It was the first time
I ever gambled.

458
00:23:06,553 --> 00:23:08,686
I've been
Back quite a bit.

459
00:23:09,121 --> 00:23:11,723
I have my own teepee.

460
00:23:12,157 --> 00:23:14,759
And i have
Money problems.

461
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:16,061
Boys and girls out there,

462
00:23:16,495 --> 00:23:18,230
Don't get into priesthood
For the money.

463
00:23:18,265 --> 00:23:20,850
It's just not worth it.

464
00:23:20,885 --> 00:23:23,400
I got a loan
From my bank.

465
00:23:23,435 --> 00:23:24,701
They sent me
This threatening letter.

466
00:23:24,736 --> 00:23:27,121
"We have not received
Your final payment. "

467
00:23:27,156 --> 00:23:29,507
I wrote them back and said,
"Yes, you have. "

468
00:23:29,508 --> 00:23:32,110
And, uh...

469
00:23:32,544 --> 00:23:34,279
Yeah.

470
00:23:36,882 --> 00:23:38,183
They were not aware of it.

471
00:23:38,617 --> 00:23:39,918
But i have had
Some money problems.

472
00:23:40,352 --> 00:23:43,388
I mention that, because, well,
The collection plate,

473
00:23:43,423 --> 00:23:45,990
Not as much money
In there as there used to be,

474
00:23:45,991 --> 00:23:47,257
I can assure you.

475
00:23:47,292 --> 00:23:50,978
Because of some of my-
Some of my colleagues',

476
00:23:51,013 --> 00:23:54,665
Can i say, shenanigans
Would be a good word.

477
00:23:54,666 --> 00:23:56,834
Which actually reminds me
Of a joke.

478
00:23:56,835 --> 00:24:03,341
A priest, a rapist and
A pedophile walked into a bar,

479
00:24:03,376 --> 00:24:05,943
And that's just
The first guy.

480
00:24:05,944 --> 00:24:07,679
All right, good, now...

481
00:24:15,487 --> 00:24:16,788
But i do thank you.

482
00:24:17,222 --> 00:24:18,523
Denis and i, we do
Go back a long time

483
00:24:18,558 --> 00:24:19,824
And i tell you what,

484
00:24:19,825 --> 00:24:21,343
It's great to be around
A guy that does not

485
00:24:21,378 --> 00:24:22,861
Forget his friends,
And i mean that sincerely.

486
00:24:22,896 --> 00:24:23,728
Thank you.

487
00:24:24,162 --> 00:24:25,862
Thank you.

488
00:24:25,897 --> 00:24:28,065
Last time
I hug a priest.

489
00:24:33,705 --> 00:24:35,873
Denis leary
Loves animals.

490
00:24:35,874 --> 00:24:38,476
He absolutely adores
His irish wolfhound

491
00:24:38,477 --> 00:24:42,814
Who wanted to be here tonight,
But he double booked.

492
00:24:42,849 --> 00:24:45,416
And when, you know,
A dog double books,

493
00:24:45,417 --> 00:24:48,453
That's like 14 human
Double bookings.

494
00:24:48,887 --> 00:24:54,092
Please welcome denis'
Irish wolfhound, clancy!

495
00:24:55,393 --> 00:24:57,995
Hi, i'm one of denis' wolfhounds.

496
00:24:57,996 --> 00:25:00,598
I'm on my way to
The veterinarian's office.

497
00:25:00,599 --> 00:25:03,201
You see, i had a chance to watch
Denis perform,

498
00:25:03,236 --> 00:25:05,369
But i thought
I'd have a lot more fun

499
00:25:05,370 --> 00:25:07,972
Having my balls cut off.

500
00:25:09,708 --> 00:25:12,310
You know, i've been denis' dog
For 12 years.

501
00:25:12,345 --> 00:25:14,045
He loves me
'Cause i'm irish.

502
00:25:14,479 --> 00:25:18,382
And i love denis 'cause
He smells like dog ass!

503
00:25:20,552 --> 00:25:22,720
You know, denis used to
Paper train me

504
00:25:22,721 --> 00:25:24,889
By using his movie scripts.

505
00:25:24,890 --> 00:25:27,492
That way,
I had a chance to shit on them

506
00:25:27,926 --> 00:25:30,528
Before the critics did.

507
00:25:30,962 --> 00:25:33,564
You know,
When i look up at denis,

508
00:25:33,565 --> 00:25:36,601
I see willem dafoe
Without the talent.

509
00:25:36,636 --> 00:25:38,336
I see an ugly bryan adams.

510
00:25:38,770 --> 00:25:42,205
I see sting
With a. I.D.S.

511
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:45,710
You know, if you want to enjoy
A denis leary comedy album,

512
00:25:45,745 --> 00:25:48,312
Do what i do
Every morning.

513
00:25:48,313 --> 00:25:52,650
Get out your copy
And take a gigantic dump on it.

514
00:25:53,084 --> 00:25:55,686
As denis' pet,

515
00:25:55,687 --> 00:25:59,590
I get to see a side of him
That most of you never do.

516
00:25:59,591 --> 00:26:01,759
Denis,
The devoted father.

517
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:03,928
Denis, the family man.

518
00:26:03,929 --> 00:26:08,700
And of course,
Denis, the jew hater.

519
00:26:09,134 --> 00:26:12,604
Well, denis, i'm going off
To have my balls cut off.

520
00:26:13,038 --> 00:26:17,375

Now, via fake satellite,
Miss rene russo.

565
00:28:48,026 --> 00:28:50,628
When i was asked
To participate in this event,

566
00:28:50,663 --> 00:28:52,328
I was not told

567
00:28:52,363 --> 00:28:54,098
That i was gonna have to be
Subjected to this crap.

568
00:28:54,532 --> 00:28:56,267
I don't even know
Nina gershon.

569
00:28:56,302 --> 00:28:57,967
What the hell
Was she singing?

570
00:28:58,002 --> 00:29:00,170
You know, that's exactly
How rumors get started.

571
00:29:00,171 --> 00:29:01,472
That's all i need,

572
00:29:01,473 --> 00:29:03,208
Are paparazzis camped outside
My fucking house

573
00:29:03,641 --> 00:29:04,942
Trying to get a crotch shot.

574
00:29:04,943 --> 00:29:07,545
Or moms in the carpool lane
Staring at me.

575
00:29:07,580 --> 00:29:11,882
Anyway...

576
00:29:14,919 --> 00:29:17,087
You know
The truth, denis.

577
00:29:17,088 --> 00:29:19,256
You were in my trailer.

578
00:29:27,065 --> 00:29:28,800
Uh, our next performer,

579
00:29:29,234 --> 00:29:31,402
There are two words to describe
Our next performer.

580
00:29:31,836 --> 00:29:35,306
Really,
Really funny.

581
00:29:35,341 --> 00:29:37,474
Mario cantone.

582
00:29:45,717 --> 00:29:49,152
Okay, gena gershon
Coming out.

583
00:29:49,187 --> 00:29:50,488
You know, i went to college
With gena and denis.

584
00:29:50,922 --> 00:29:52,188
I went to college.

585
00:29:52,223 --> 00:29:53,524
I went to emerson college
With denis and gena.

586
00:29:53,525 --> 00:29:54,791
No applause.

587
00:29:54,826 --> 00:29:59,996
At the time, the school was
A 60% gay school.

588
00:30:00,031 --> 00:30:06,971
Denis ended up staying there
For two years and teaching.

589
00:30:07,006 --> 00:30:09,139
You're so gay.

590
00:30:09,574 --> 00:30:12,176
I can't even,
I can't even look at you.

591
00:30:12,610 --> 00:30:14,778
We were lovers, we were
Fucking completely.

592
00:30:14,779 --> 00:30:16,479
He won't even-
Kiss- i want you to-

593
00:30:16,514 --> 00:30:18,249
I want you to kiss me
On the mouth right here,

594
00:30:18,683 --> 00:30:21,285
And show everybody in this
World what we were.

595
00:30:21,286 --> 00:30:22,552
I feel like
Barbara stanwyck.

596
00:30:22,587 --> 00:30:25,623
Kiss me on the mouth,
Like a lover!

597
00:30:25,658 --> 00:30:27,375
No, it's all right.

598
00:30:27,410 --> 00:30:29,058
You couldn't
Anyways,

599
00:30:29,093 --> 00:30:32,996
'Cause you don't have that kind
Of a range as an actress.

600
00:30:36,901 --> 00:30:38,202
I've seen him naked,

601
00:30:38,636 --> 00:30:42,071
I have seen him naked
And it hooks to the left.

602
00:30:42,106 --> 00:30:44,708
And it's not, for an irish guy,
It's not that small.

603
00:30:44,709 --> 00:30:45,576
It's really not-
It's all right.

604
00:30:46,010 --> 00:30:47,311
It's not bad,
But it hooks!

605
00:30:47,312 --> 00:30:49,879
He's got a pirate dick!

606
00:30:49,914 --> 00:30:52,516
He wears
A patch over one ball.

607
00:30:57,288 --> 00:30:58,589
Elizabeth hurley.

608
00:30:58,590 --> 00:31:01,591
She is so gorgeous,
I would fuck her.

609
00:31:01,626 --> 00:31:03,794
I have never seen anybody more
Beautiful in my life.

610
00:31:03,795 --> 00:31:06,397
Except i'd have
To use nick's dick

611
00:31:06,432 --> 00:31:08,132
But i could do it.

612
00:31:08,167 --> 00:31:09,867
All right.

613
00:31:09,868 --> 00:31:12,435
Thanks for
The gift bag, too.

614
00:31:12,470 --> 00:31:14,205
They gave us this lovely
Gift bag, you know,

615
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:15,471
For doing this.

616
00:31:15,506 --> 00:31:16,807
Which i thought was really,
Really nice.

617
00:31:16,808 --> 00:31:19,410
Thank you
For your c-ds.

618
00:31:19,844 --> 00:31:22,012

And "the job" d-v-d,
"The job" d-v-d.

And second season.

621
00:31:28,953 --> 00:31:30,688
Let me put a little reality
On the plate here.

622
00:31:30,723 --> 00:31:35,025
There was no
Fucking second season!

623
00:31:35,460 --> 00:31:36,726
Where was
The second season?

624
00:31:36,761 --> 00:31:40,664
There was no- oh, the lost
Episodes of "the job".

Would reject the repeats!

628
00:31:56,714 --> 00:31:58,015
You're a little weathered.

629
00:31:58,016 --> 00:31:59,317
You're a little
Weathered lately.

630
00:31:59,751 --> 00:32:00,583
Bronzer?

631
00:32:00,618 --> 00:32:01,919
Tan-
No, it's fucking makeup.

632
00:32:02,353 --> 00:32:04,088
His shit is so thick
You can't even-

633
00:32:04,123 --> 00:32:05,788
And then he
Made fun of me!

634
00:32:05,823 --> 00:32:07,124
We were at this thing, we were
At the tribeca film festival

635
00:32:07,558 --> 00:32:09,293
And they were like, "would you
Like a little powder?"

636
00:32:09,294 --> 00:32:10,560
I was like, "yeah. "

637
00:32:10,595 --> 00:32:14,065
He was like, "you're gonna-
You're gonna put makeup on?

638
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:15,800
You're gonna put makeup on?"

639
00:32:15,835 --> 00:32:17,101
I was like, "yeah. "

640
00:32:17,535 --> 00:32:20,137
you- you came to carnegie hall
In makeup for rehearsal!

641
00:32:20,138 --> 00:32:24,041
you go to non-television
Events in mac makeup.

642
00:32:24,042 --> 00:32:28,813
It looks like you
Just fucked rupaul!

643
00:32:30,114 --> 00:32:31,415
Ugh!

644
00:32:31,416 --> 00:32:34,851
He is in "full beat"!

645
00:32:34,886 --> 00:32:37,488
it looks like mary kay's
Pink cadillac

646
00:32:37,523 --> 00:32:40,958
Ran you the fuck over!

647
00:32:43,561 --> 00:32:45,729
And i love you,
Denis.

648
00:32:45,764 --> 00:32:47,898
Thank you very much.

649
00:33:04,182 --> 00:33:05,483
Hi, i'm michael j fox.

650
00:33:05,917 --> 00:33:07,218
And this is eunice.

651
00:33:07,652 --> 00:33:09,820
Eunice is 85 years old
And a parkinson's patient.

652
00:33:09,821 --> 00:33:11,989
Eunice has but one wish.

653
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:14,592
That denis leary stop
Volunteering his time

654
00:33:15,026 --> 00:33:15,858
For parkinson's research.

655
00:33:15,893 --> 00:33:18,495
You see, denis, showing up
Late and drunk

656
00:33:18,496 --> 00:33:20,231
To fundraising events,
Mouthing off to doctors

657
00:33:20,665 --> 00:33:22,400
And potential donors,
It's just not helping.

658
00:33:22,435 --> 00:33:24,152
So please,
Denis.

659
00:33:24,187 --> 00:33:25,835
Think of eunice,

660
00:33:25,870 --> 00:33:27,821
And the thousands of
Other parkinson's sufferers.

661
00:33:27,856 --> 00:33:29,773
Do something else with your
Ample frickin' time.

662
00:33:29,774 --> 00:33:31,942
Thank you,
I'm michael j fox.

663
00:33:35,413 --> 00:33:37,148
Some of you might recognize
These guys

664
00:33:37,183 --> 00:33:41,485
As the hosts of
"Yo! M-t-v raps"

665
00:33:41,486 --> 00:33:46,257
But most of you will have
No idea who they are.

666
00:33:46,691 --> 00:33:50,594
Put on your thinking caps.

667
00:33:50,595 --> 00:33:54,065
Please welcome dr. Dre
And ed lover.

668
00:34:01,439 --> 00:34:03,607
Denis has had a very
Impressive film career,

669
00:34:03,608 --> 00:34:06,210
And we thought we'd give
You guys a quick overview,

670
00:34:06,644 --> 00:34:07,945
To refresh your memory.

671
00:34:08,379 --> 00:34:10,079
But because
There are so many,

672
00:34:10,114 --> 00:34:12,282
We kept all the reviews
Down to two words.

673
00:34:12,283 --> 00:34:14,018
So let's begin.

674
00:34:15,319 --> 00:34:16,620
"Professor"?

675
00:34:16,621 --> 00:34:17,488
Yes, sir.

676
00:34:17,922 --> 00:34:18,789
"Ice age"?

677
00:34:18,790 --> 00:34:20,525
Not "shrek".

678
00:34:20,958 --> 00:34:23,343
"Double whammy"?

679
00:34:23,378 --> 00:34:25,729
Triple crappy.

680
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:27,031
"Company man".

681
00:34:27,465 --> 00:34:29,416
You're fired.

682
00:34:29,451 --> 00:34:31,368
"Jesus' son".

683
00:34:31,369 --> 00:34:34,839
Holy shit.

684
00:34:35,273 --> 00:34:37,008
"The thomas crown affair".

685
00:34:37,043 --> 00:34:39,410
Watch original.

686
00:34:39,445 --> 00:34:41,778
"True crime".

687
00:34:41,779 --> 00:34:44,381
Against cinema.

688
00:34:44,382 --> 00:34:46,767
"A bug's life".

689
00:34:46,802 --> 00:34:49,153
Call exterminator.

690
00:34:49,188 --> 00:34:50,454
"Wide awake".

691
00:34:50,455 --> 00:34:53,022
Not us.

692
00:34:53,057 --> 00:34:54,323
"Monument avenue".

693
00:34:54,358 --> 00:34:56,960
Bad title, brother,
Bad title.

694
00:34:56,961 --> 00:34:58,262
"Wag the dog".

695
00:34:58,297 --> 00:35:00,430
Dog crap.

696
00:35:00,431 --> 00:35:02,382
"The matchmaker".

697
00:35:02,417 --> 00:35:04,334
The crap taker.

698
00:35:04,335 --> 00:35:05,636
"Operation dumbo drop".

699
00:35:06,070 --> 00:35:10,407
Operation fucking
Boredom over here.

700
00:35:10,408 --> 00:35:13,010
A classic,
"The ref".

701
00:35:13,045 --> 00:35:15,178
Personal foul.

702
00:35:15,613 --> 00:35:16,914
"Judgment night".

703
00:35:16,949 --> 00:35:19,082
It sucked.

704
00:35:19,083 --> 00:35:20,818
"Demolition man".

705
00:35:20,853 --> 00:35:22,986
Why, denis?

706
00:35:23,421 --> 00:35:24,253
"Who's the man"?

707
00:35:24,288 --> 00:35:25,589
Now, that's
Classic material.

708
00:35:25,590 --> 00:35:26,457
That was a great film.

709
00:35:26,891 --> 00:35:28,192
Beautiful film.

710
00:35:29,927 --> 00:35:30,794
There you go.

711
00:35:31,229 --> 00:35:32,964
That's a nice
Piece of work.

712
00:35:32,999 --> 00:35:34,933
"The sandlot".

713
00:35:34,968 --> 00:35:36,867
The litter box.

714
00:35:36,868 --> 00:35:38,169
"The loaded weapon".

715
00:35:38,204 --> 00:35:40,337
Loaded diaper.

716
00:35:40,338 --> 00:35:41,604
And ladies and gentlemen,

717
00:35:41,639 --> 00:35:43,807
That oscar-winning performance,
"Two if by sea".

718
00:35:43,808 --> 00:35:46,410
Fuck you.

719
00:35:52,049 --> 00:35:53,350
Thank you.

720
00:35:53,351 --> 00:35:55,051
Thank you, folks.

721
00:35:55,086 --> 00:35:57,254
It's been
Our distinct pleasure

722
00:35:57,688 --> 00:35:59,856
Reviewing these movies.

723
00:36:00,291 --> 00:36:01,158
Good luck
Tonight, denis.

724
00:36:01,592 --> 00:36:03,292
Mr. Sutherland,
It's a pleasure.

725
00:36:03,327 --> 00:36:08,098
Miss hurley, and your
Ambiguously gay fellow friend,

726
00:36:08,099 --> 00:36:11,534
Wonderful to see you both.

727
00:36:11,569 --> 00:36:13,737
Now we know
Who's fucking mario cantone

728
00:36:14,172 --> 00:36:16,123
Later on tonight.

729
00:36:16,158 --> 00:36:18,075
We love you, buddy!

730
00:36:18,509 --> 00:36:20,677
God bless.

731
00:36:34,458 --> 00:36:37,928
So, tonight,
Everybody's been slammed

732
00:36:38,362 --> 00:36:40,062
To one degree or another.

733
00:36:40,097 --> 00:36:46,169
But this next performer is
So gifted and so talented.

734
00:36:46,170 --> 00:36:47,870
He's a vivacious talent,

735
00:36:47,905 --> 00:36:51,808
Who really- i'm moved
To tears when i see him perform.

736
00:36:51,809 --> 00:36:54,845
I laugh,
I'm overwhelmed.

737
00:36:55,279 --> 00:36:57,014
I'm talking, of course,
About dane cook.

738
00:36:57,049 --> 00:36:59,182
Dane cook is- dane,

739
00:36:59,183 --> 00:37:01,351
You're too talented
To fuck with.

740
00:37:01,352 --> 00:37:03,052
Really,
You're that talented.

741
00:37:03,087 --> 00:37:07,207
You are so talented, my balls
Right now are clapping.

742
00:37:07,242 --> 00:37:11,328
My balls are clapping at how
Talented you are, dane cook.

743
00:37:11,762 --> 00:37:13,497
Please come out here
And show the young people.

744
00:37:13,532 --> 00:37:15,232
Dane cook, everybody.

745
00:37:26,077 --> 00:37:27,343
Wow, jeff,
Jeff garlin.

746
00:37:27,378 --> 00:37:31,281
What about jeff all night,
Jeff, right?

747
00:37:31,282 --> 00:37:33,017
Kiefer sutherland,
How you doing?

748
00:37:33,451 --> 00:37:34,717
How you doing,
Good to see you.

749
00:37:34,752 --> 00:37:37,788
I've got a great plot idea for
Your show this coming season.

750
00:37:37,823 --> 00:37:42,125
You've got 24 hours
To resurrect your film career

751
00:37:42,126 --> 00:37:46,897
Or you're gonna start
Hocking motor oil,

752
00:37:46,932 --> 00:37:50,367
Like johnny handsome
Over here.

753
00:37:50,368 --> 00:37:55,139
Good to see you,
Loved you in "lost boys".

754
00:37:55,174 --> 00:37:57,325
It's a great movie!

755
00:37:57,360 --> 00:37:59,476
It's a classic!

756
00:37:59,477 --> 00:38:02,912
Colin quinn, ladies and
Gentlemen, colin quinn.

757
00:38:02,947 --> 00:38:06,417
Colin, you started off
Your career on the game show,

758
00:38:06,452 --> 00:38:08,117
"Remote control".

759
00:38:08,152 --> 00:38:10,320
And isn't it-
Yeah, yeah!

760
00:38:10,321 --> 00:38:13,357
Isn't it ironic that
That's what most of america

761
00:38:13,791 --> 00:38:18,128
Reaches for now when
Your new show comes on?

762
00:38:18,129 --> 00:38:20,297
Nick dipaolo.

763
00:38:20,298 --> 00:38:22,033
Nick, right?
Nick right over here.

764
00:38:22,068 --> 00:38:25,069
Nick, anti-semitic?

765
00:38:25,104 --> 00:38:27,237
Yes.

766
00:38:27,238 --> 00:38:29,189
Homophobic?

767
00:38:29,224 --> 00:38:31,141
Of course.

768
00:38:31,575 --> 00:38:32,442
Racist?

769
00:38:32,443 --> 00:38:33,709
Totally.

770
00:38:33,744 --> 00:38:34,611
Misogynistic?

771
00:38:35,046 --> 00:38:36,312
Without a doubt.

772
00:38:36,347 --> 00:38:38,515
But what you guys
Don't know about nick,

773
00:38:38,516 --> 00:38:41,552
Is he still sleeps in
A racecar bed.

774
00:38:41,986 --> 00:38:43,721
And say what you want
About this other shit,

775
00:38:43,756 --> 00:38:46,323
That's just adorable.

776
00:38:49,794 --> 00:38:52,361
Mario,
Mario cantone.

777
00:38:52,396 --> 00:38:54,998
Mario, some people say
You're not very friendly.

778
00:38:54,999 --> 00:38:56,300
Some people say
You're unapproachable.

779
00:38:56,734 --> 00:38:58,902
But i'll tell you something
About this guy,

780
00:38:59,337 --> 00:39:01,939
He's got a real soft spot
For young comedians.

781
00:39:01,974 --> 00:39:04,541
It's called his asshole.

782
00:39:04,975 --> 00:39:06,710
See how i wrinkled
That a little?

783
00:39:07,144 --> 00:39:08,445
All right.

784
00:39:08,446 --> 00:39:10,181
Let me tell you
How gay mario is.

785
00:39:10,216 --> 00:39:11,013
Truly,
Seriously.

786
00:39:11,048 --> 00:39:12,349
Because i know you've heard it
All night.

787
00:39:12,350 --> 00:39:13,651
Let me just,
You know, close it up for you.

788
00:39:14,085 --> 00:39:14,952
He is so gay

789
00:39:15,386 --> 00:39:17,988
That when gay people
See him on the street,

790
00:39:18,023 --> 00:39:21,024
They're like, "fag!"

791
00:39:23,194 --> 00:39:26,664
I'm still waiting for you
To come out, bitch.

792
00:39:26,699 --> 00:39:28,364
All right.

793
00:39:28,399 --> 00:39:31,435
All right, i'll be there
In 10 minutes, honey.

794
00:39:31,869 --> 00:39:34,471
Dr. Dre and ed lover,
They're here tonight.

795
00:39:34,472 --> 00:39:36,640
And be sure to tip them
When they bring your car around

796
00:39:36,675 --> 00:39:39,676
After the show.

797
00:39:42,279 --> 00:39:43,979
Denis, denis.

798
00:39:44,014 --> 00:39:45,749
A lot of boston guys here
Tonight.

799
00:39:45,750 --> 00:39:49,436
Denis, we've got lenny clarke,
We've got nick, mario.

800
00:39:49,471 --> 00:39:53,123
Who knew the red sox curse
Affected comedians' careers?

801
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:57,860
During the '80s, denis,

802
00:39:57,895 --> 00:40:00,497
Few comedians
Took a stand.

803
00:40:00,498 --> 00:40:01,799
And had the courage
To speak out

804
00:40:02,233 --> 00:40:04,800
And support their beliefs

805
00:40:04,835 --> 00:40:09,606
And that all changed when
Denis did "no cure for cancer".

806
00:40:09,607 --> 00:40:11,775
You came out, denis,
Yeah.

807
00:40:11,776 --> 00:40:13,944
You came out
Against vegetarians.

808
00:40:13,979 --> 00:40:16,997
And you stood up against
Non-smokers.

809
00:40:17,032 --> 00:40:20,016
And because
Of your valiant efforts,

810
00:40:20,017 --> 00:40:24,788
Today, meat-
Still available.

811
00:40:24,789 --> 00:40:26,524
Tobacco- still going strong.

812
00:40:26,559 --> 00:40:29,994
Cancer-
Winning.

813
00:40:30,029 --> 00:40:31,694
Woo!

814
00:40:31,729 --> 00:40:33,030
In closing, denis,
You know i'm kidding,

815
00:40:33,464 --> 00:40:35,632
And you know
You're a great guy.

816
00:40:35,667 --> 00:40:37,801
And it makes me feel
So special

817
00:40:37,802 --> 00:40:39,970
To know that if i ever need
Anything at all from you,

818
00:40:40,005 --> 00:40:43,006
Jim serpico
Is just a phone call away.

819
00:40:43,007 --> 00:40:45,609
I love you, buddy,
Thank you.

820
00:40:55,586 --> 00:40:58,188
If you want to toast denis,
I'm your man.

821
00:40:58,189 --> 00:41:00,791
If you wanna roast him,
I'm sorry, i love the guy.

822
00:41:01,225 --> 00:41:02,960
You know, i think he just
Gets a bad rap

823
00:41:03,394 --> 00:41:04,660
Because of
The whole gruff thing.

824
00:41:04,695 --> 00:41:07,297
Hey, this is denis, what do you want?

825
00:41:07,298 --> 00:41:09,033
He used to scare
The heart out of my wife.

826
00:41:09,068 --> 00:41:09,900
You know, but not anymore.

827
00:41:10,334 --> 00:41:11,201
Because when
I'm on the road,

828
00:41:11,635 --> 00:41:13,370
When i'm away from home,
He's the first one to call.

829
00:41:13,405 --> 00:41:15,122
He says, "can i help you
With the yard work?"

830
00:41:15,157 --> 00:41:16,840
Which is funny because
I think the only things

831
00:41:17,274 --> 00:41:18,575
I've ever seen in his hands

832
00:41:19,009 --> 00:41:20,527
Is a cigarette
Or a hockey stick.

833
00:41:20,562 --> 00:41:22,045
But he keeps
An eye on the kids,

834
00:41:22,046 --> 00:41:23,564
He keeps an eye on my wife.

835
00:41:23,599 --> 00:41:25,082
And he's looking
Out for me.

836
00:41:25,117 --> 00:41:26,348
And i don't forget that.

837
00:41:26,383 --> 00:41:28,985
The thing is,
I hope he gets a job soon,

838
00:41:28,986 --> 00:41:30,721
Because my kids are calling
Him "dad".

839
00:41:30,756 --> 00:41:32,456
I mean, right now
They're all together.

840
00:41:32,491 --> 00:41:35,492
My wife, denis, the kids.

841
00:41:35,493 --> 00:41:37,227
They're back at my house,
Back east,

842
00:41:37,262 --> 00:41:38,962
And they're having
A great time.

843
00:41:39,396 --> 00:41:40,263
I just got off the phone
With my little girl

844
00:41:40,698 --> 00:41:41,964
And i said, "where's mommy?"

845
00:41:41,999 --> 00:41:43,300
She said, "oh, mommy's
Down with denis

846
00:41:43,335 --> 00:41:46,336
Playing hockey in the pond. "

847
00:41:46,337 --> 00:41:50,674
you know, which is funny,
Because my wife hates hockey.

848
00:41:50,709 --> 00:41:54,577
And, uh...

849
00:41:54,578 --> 00:41:57,180
And it's 80 fuckin' degrees
Back there.

850
00:41:57,181 --> 00:41:59,783
There is no fuckin' ice.

851
00:42:12,730 --> 00:42:14,465
Ladies and gentlemen,
Mr. Lenny clarke.

852
00:42:25,743 --> 00:42:27,911
Denis and i have
A lot in common.

853
00:42:27,912 --> 00:42:31,382
We both smoke and hang out
With supermodels.

854
00:42:31,815 --> 00:42:34,417
Some of them are
Chubby chasers.

855
00:42:34,418 --> 00:42:37,419
They are.

856
00:42:37,454 --> 00:42:38,755
But i gotta tell you,

857
00:42:39,189 --> 00:42:40,924
People ask me, "well,
How do you know denis?"

858
00:42:40,925 --> 00:42:43,527
I say, "well, i've known
Denis for about 25 years now. "

859
00:42:43,562 --> 00:42:46,129
I remember when
We were doing lines

860
00:42:46,130 --> 00:42:49,131
And now we're reading lines.

861
00:42:49,166 --> 00:42:50,901
People say, "did he do
A lot of drugs?"

862
00:42:50,936 --> 00:42:51,768
I say, "no. "

863
00:42:52,202 --> 00:42:53,069
Denis didn't,
Look at him.

864
00:42:53,504 --> 00:42:55,239
What's he, 6'3, 6'4,
110 pounds?

865
00:42:55,274 --> 00:42:58,709
Nah.

866
00:43:01,312 --> 00:43:03,480
Make a lot of jokes
About me being fat

867
00:43:03,515 --> 00:43:05,648
But how about him
Being skinny?

868
00:43:05,649 --> 00:43:10,854
this guy could use a kotex tube
For a sleeping bag.

869
00:43:13,891 --> 00:43:16,493
You know,
Denis leary's been my friend

870
00:43:16,528 --> 00:43:18,193
For a lot of years.

871
00:43:18,228 --> 00:43:19,529
He's given me
A lot of work,

872
00:43:19,530 --> 00:43:21,230
Helped jumpstart my career.

873
00:43:21,265 --> 00:43:23,650
I didn't do any
Of his big hits,

874
00:43:23,685 --> 00:43:25,728
But you know,
There was "the job".

875
00:43:25,763 --> 00:43:27,771
And i was out of work
And divorced

876
00:43:27,806 --> 00:43:29,471
And drinking and drugging

877
00:43:29,506 --> 00:43:32,108
And collecting money
From people.

878
00:43:32,109 --> 00:43:36,446
You guys know
What i'm talking about.

879
00:43:39,483 --> 00:43:41,651
He said to me, "you know,
I wrote this part for you

880
00:43:41,652 --> 00:43:43,352
In 'the job'."
I said, "really?"

881
00:43:43,387 --> 00:43:45,989
he says, "yeah, but a-b-c wants
To go with another guy. "

882
00:43:45,990 --> 00:43:47,256
I go, "what?

883
00:43:47,291 --> 00:43:49,459
You go in there, and you tell
Them that that's my part!"

884
00:43:49,460 --> 00:43:51,195
He says, "you want me
To go in and tell them

885
00:43:51,629 --> 00:43:53,364
To give you the part just
Because you're my friend?"

886
00:43:53,399 --> 00:43:54,630
I went, "yeah!"

887
00:43:54,665 --> 00:43:56,365
He goes,
"I can't do that. "

888
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:58,135
I said "well, maybe you're not
My friend. "

889
00:43:58,569 --> 00:43:59,870
And he made me dance
Like a monkey on a hot plate

890
00:43:59,905 --> 00:44:03,340
To get that part
And i got that part.

891
00:44:03,774 --> 00:44:06,376
And he said, "aren't you happy
That you got it on your own?"

892
00:44:06,377 --> 00:44:09,413
I said,
"Not one fucking bit. "

893
00:44:12,883 --> 00:44:15,485
Mario, i didn't even know
You were gay.

894
00:44:15,919 --> 00:44:18,521
I didn't,
I didn't!

895
00:44:18,522 --> 00:44:20,690
I like you.

896
00:44:20,691 --> 00:44:22,391
Some men like men,
And well,

897
00:44:22,426 --> 00:44:23,727
Women are probably
The number one reason

898
00:44:23,762 --> 00:44:27,162
Why i'm not
A homosexual today.

899
00:44:27,197 --> 00:44:32,402
All right, i blew one guy,
But i needed a ride real bad.

900
00:44:32,403 --> 00:44:34,571
I'm teasing,
I'm kidding.

901
00:44:34,606 --> 00:44:36,739
I didn't need the ride.

902
00:44:36,740 --> 00:44:40,175
But,
I gotta tell you,

903
00:44:40,210 --> 00:44:41,910
This guy does a lot of things
For people

904
00:44:41,945 --> 00:44:44,113
That he doesn't want
Anyone to even know about.

905
00:44:44,114 --> 00:44:45,849
But you are one of
My dearest friends.

906
00:44:45,884 --> 00:44:46,716
I love you like a brother.

907
00:44:46,717 --> 00:44:48,668
And i'd take
A bullet for you.

908
00:44:48,703 --> 00:44:50,620
I just hope it's not tonight.

909
00:44:50,621 --> 00:44:53,223
And i just want
To thank you, man.

910
00:44:53,258 --> 00:44:54,090
I love you.

911
00:44:54,091 --> 00:44:55,826
All right.

912
00:45:02,766 --> 00:45:04,067
Hey, everybody.

913
00:45:04,068 --> 00:45:06,670
I'm so sorry that
I couldn't be there tonight,

914
00:45:06,705 --> 00:45:10,105
But i had this really-

915
00:45:10,140 --> 00:45:11,441
Ah, i can't fool
You guys.

916
00:45:11,875 --> 00:45:14,477
I could have
Been there tonight.

917
00:45:14,478 --> 00:45:16,646
Actually, i've got
Nothing to do.

918
00:45:16,647 --> 00:45:17,948
As a matter of fact,
Right now,

919
00:45:18,382 --> 00:45:20,550
As you guys are roasting denis
In the hammerstein ballroom,

920
00:45:20,551 --> 00:45:22,719
My guess is
I'm sitting at home,

921
00:45:23,153 --> 00:45:25,538
Alone,
Staring at my wall.

922
00:45:25,573 --> 00:45:27,924
And you may say, "well,

923
00:45:27,925 --> 00:45:29,226
Then why didn't you come over
And do it?"

924
00:45:29,660 --> 00:45:30,926
And i'll tell you why.

925
00:45:30,961 --> 00:45:32,696
I've been hearing the things
You're saying about denis.

926
00:45:32,731 --> 00:45:34,396
His lack of ability,

927
00:45:34,431 --> 00:45:38,334
His difficulty in controlling
His more primal urges,

928
00:45:38,335 --> 00:45:40,503
And i won't be
A part of it.

929
00:45:40,504 --> 00:45:44,407
I will not kick this man
When he is so clearly

930
00:45:44,408 --> 00:45:46,576
This far down.

931
00:45:46,577 --> 00:45:47,843
Normally,
I would.

932
00:45:47,878 --> 00:45:49,144
I've known denis
For a long time

933
00:45:49,179 --> 00:45:52,649
And everything that you're
Saying, by god, it's true.

934
00:45:52,684 --> 00:45:55,251
And if you only knew,
Much worse.

935
00:45:55,252 --> 00:45:59,589
I'm not saying that
He has sex with animals.

936
00:45:59,590 --> 00:46:01,290
What i'm saying is this:

937
00:46:01,325 --> 00:46:03,927
I can't be with him
24 hours a day.

938
00:46:03,962 --> 00:46:06,095
So maybe, maybe not.

939
00:46:06,096 --> 00:46:07,831
It's really not something that
We should talk about.

940
00:46:08,265 --> 00:46:09,566
But the important thing
Is this:

941
00:46:09,601 --> 00:46:12,602
He needs this gig.

942
00:46:12,603 --> 00:46:13,904
So if you can stretch it
To an hour and a half

943
00:46:13,939 --> 00:46:16,506
And maybe throw him
A little after money,

944
00:46:16,507 --> 00:46:20,844
I'd love to see the guy
Get some health insurance.

945
00:46:20,879 --> 00:46:22,579
Well, listen, you guys
Have a great night.

946
00:46:23,013 --> 00:46:26,483
And just know that even though
I can't be there, or can,

947
00:46:26,917 --> 00:46:29,085
I'm still
Thinking about you

948
00:46:29,086 --> 00:46:32,989
For however long
This videotape message lasts.

949
00:46:32,990 --> 00:46:34,725
And then, of course,
Right after that-

950
00:46:34,760 --> 00:46:37,761
Whoop- gone!

951
00:46:47,337 --> 00:46:49,072
Um, it's been great
To be here tonight

952
00:46:49,107 --> 00:46:50,807
To host this for you.

953
00:46:50,808 --> 00:46:52,941
And i enjoy
Being your friend.

954
00:46:52,976 --> 00:46:55,578
You're a great guy to be
A friend with, you know?

955
00:46:56,013 --> 00:46:56,880
That's all.

956
00:46:57,314 --> 00:46:59,916
Ladies and gentlemen,
Denis leary.

957
00:47:15,098 --> 00:47:17,266
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

958
00:47:19,870 --> 00:47:21,605
Thanks,
Thank you.

959
00:47:23,774 --> 00:47:25,942
As my dad used to say,

960
00:47:25,943 --> 00:47:28,111
Too little,
Too fuckin' late, folks.

961
00:47:28,545 --> 00:47:29,846
Sorry.

962
00:47:29,847 --> 00:47:32,414
Fuck you, you filthy whores.

963
00:47:32,449 --> 00:47:34,617
Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you,
Double fuck you,

964
00:47:34,618 --> 00:47:37,220
Fuck you, fuck you.

965
00:47:39,389 --> 00:47:41,557
I wanna say a couple- well,
I gotta say a lot of things.

966
00:47:41,558 --> 00:47:43,258
So strap yourselves in.

967
00:47:43,293 --> 00:47:45,461
Let's start off
By giving a round of applause

968
00:47:45,462 --> 00:47:48,064
To rene russo for wearing
A giant rubber cock.

969
00:47:48,065 --> 00:47:51,101
Come on!

970
00:47:53,704 --> 00:47:55,872
Uh, i want to mention
A couple of guys

971
00:47:55,873 --> 00:47:57,608
Who couldn't be here tonight.

972
00:47:58,041 --> 00:48:00,209
Chris was supposed to be here
In person, chris walken,

973
00:48:00,210 --> 00:48:01,476
But unfortunately,

974
00:48:01,511 --> 00:48:02,812
The guest list was limited
To people

975
00:48:02,813 --> 00:48:04,513
From the fucking
Planet earth.

976
00:48:04,548 --> 00:48:07,150
So i don't know where he did
The remote fucking feed from

977
00:48:07,584 --> 00:48:10,620
But yeah.

978
00:48:10,621 --> 00:48:13,657
Can we throw that picture
Of peter gallagher up, please?

979
00:48:15,826 --> 00:48:17,994
Peter's got a lot of balls
Making fun of me.

980
00:48:17,995 --> 00:48:20,163
You know, when i check into
A hotel and i want privacy,

981
00:48:20,597 --> 00:48:22,765
I check in under the name
Peter gallagher, okay?

982
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:25,802
Just so you fucking know.

983
00:48:27,104 --> 00:48:28,405
By the way,

984
00:48:28,839 --> 00:48:30,140
The auditions for the role
Of harvey weinstein

985
00:48:30,574 --> 00:48:37,514
In the harvey weinstein story
Are officially fuckin' over.

986
00:48:40,984 --> 00:48:42,935
And by the way,
While you're looking at jeff

987
00:48:42,970 --> 00:48:44,887
And his picture,
Take a good look at his nose,

988
00:48:44,888 --> 00:48:47,924
Before it goes right back
Up larry david's ass, okay?

989
00:48:47,925 --> 00:48:51,828
It'll be up there for about
Another five fuckin' years.

990
00:48:51,863 --> 00:48:53,996
A waitress at "dangerfield's"

991
00:48:53,997 --> 00:48:55,298
Once equated going down
On jeff garlin

992
00:48:55,299 --> 00:48:59,636
With trying to find
The air nozzle on a life raft.

993
00:49:00,070 --> 00:49:02,672
So that'll give you
Some idea.

994
00:49:03,106 --> 00:49:04,841
Colin quinn.

995
00:49:08,745 --> 00:49:11,781
People know a lot of things
About colin,

996
00:49:11,782 --> 00:49:13,733
But they don't know this:

997
00:49:13,768 --> 00:49:15,685
Colin's
An inventor.

998
00:49:15,686 --> 00:49:19,372
Colin invented
The "dick on" rule.

999
00:49:19,407 --> 00:49:23,059
This was back in,
I think the mid '80s

1000
00:49:23,060 --> 00:49:24,760
And here was the idea.

1001
00:49:24,795 --> 00:49:28,265
Every time colin saw somebody
On t. V. Who he didn't like

1002
00:49:28,300 --> 00:49:30,433
Or he didn't
Think was funny,

1003
00:49:30,434 --> 00:49:32,169
He would pull his
Pants down.

1004
00:49:32,204 --> 00:49:33,435
Wherever you were,

1005
00:49:33,470 --> 00:49:34,736
A bar, his house,
Your house.

1006
00:49:34,771 --> 00:49:36,939
Pull his pants down,
And take his dick,

1007
00:49:37,374 --> 00:49:41,711
And he would put it in
The guy's face on the t. V.

1008
00:49:41,712 --> 00:49:43,447
We were so used to it,
Guys would just go,

1009
00:49:43,880 --> 00:49:45,615
"Hey, hey,
Move out of the way,

1010
00:49:45,650 --> 00:49:47,350
We can't see the
Fuckin' game. "

1011
00:49:47,351 --> 00:49:49,051
I don't know if
You remember this.

1012
00:49:49,086 --> 00:49:50,821
We were watching- the knicks
Were out of the playoffs,

1013
00:49:50,856 --> 00:49:51,688
So he's rooting
For the celtics,

1014
00:49:52,122 --> 00:49:53,857
In the heyday of
The byrd-mchale celtics,

1015
00:49:53,892 --> 00:49:55,123
And they're playing
The pistons,

1016
00:49:55,158 --> 00:49:56,893
And bill laimbeer from
The pistons got into a fight,

1017
00:49:56,928 --> 00:49:59,929
A little scuffle
With larry byrd.

1018
00:49:59,930 --> 00:50:02,749
He pulls his pants down,
Walks up to the t. V.,

1019
00:50:02,784 --> 00:50:05,568
And for literally, like
A good 30 or 40 seconds,

1020
00:50:05,569 --> 00:50:07,737
He's going, "go ahead, laimbeer,
Suck my dick!

1021
00:50:07,738 --> 00:50:08,570
"Suck my dick!

1022
00:50:08,605 --> 00:50:09,906
"Come on,
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

1023
00:50:09,941 --> 00:50:12,508
Come on!"

1024
00:50:12,943 --> 00:50:16,846
And then,
My wife came home.

1025
00:50:20,317 --> 00:50:22,485
Now, it's very difficult to
Explain to a woman,

1026
00:50:22,486 --> 00:50:24,654
Any woman,
Who has just seen

1027
00:50:25,088 --> 00:50:26,389
One of your best friends
Trying to shove his dick

1028
00:50:26,823 --> 00:50:30,726
Into a televised man's mouth

1029
00:50:30,727 --> 00:50:34,197
That it's just typical
Heterosexual behavior,

1030
00:50:34,232 --> 00:50:35,932
Even if he invented it.

1031
00:50:35,967 --> 00:50:38,100
You know.

1032
00:50:38,101 --> 00:50:40,269
But it's absolutely impossible
To explain that behavior

1033
00:50:40,270 --> 00:50:42,872
Once you've seen this:

1034
00:50:55,886 --> 00:50:58,488
And then, of course,
There's this:

1035
00:51:05,862 --> 00:51:07,597
What can i say
About mario cantone

1036
00:51:08,031 --> 00:51:12,368
That hasn't been said
In "little women"?

1037
00:51:12,369 --> 00:51:14,537
You know, some kids are born
With speech impediments.

1038
00:51:14,538 --> 00:51:16,671
Some kids are born
With learning disabilities.

1039
00:51:16,706 --> 00:51:19,742
mario came out with a gucci
Purse and his nails done.

1040
00:51:19,743 --> 00:51:21,911
The only reason pete townshend
Got busted

1041
00:51:21,912 --> 00:51:24,948
Was because
He borrowed mario's laptop.

1042
00:51:27,117 --> 00:51:28,852
That's a good line, i like
That fuckin' line.

1043
00:51:29,286 --> 00:51:30,587
Fuck you,
That's a good line.

1044
00:51:30,622 --> 00:51:32,322
And i like pete townshend

1045
00:51:32,756 --> 00:51:34,924
And i still did
That fuckin' line!

1046
00:51:35,358 --> 00:51:39,695
Now, mario, we went
To college together.

1047
00:51:39,696 --> 00:51:41,864
And mario, it was a very
Difficult time for mario.

1048
00:51:41,865 --> 00:51:45,768
Mario was living in this gay
World, a fantasy world,

1049
00:51:45,769 --> 00:51:47,504
At emerson college
Where i think it was like,

1050
00:51:47,938 --> 00:51:49,239
Three out of every four guys
Were gay, right?

1051
00:51:49,274 --> 00:51:50,939
60% gay,
I already said it.

1052
00:51:50,974 --> 00:51:52,709
I think it was more than that,
You're underestimating.

1053
00:51:53,143 --> 00:51:54,878
It was like 80%, it was great
For straight guys like me.

1054
00:51:54,913 --> 00:51:56,613
We got laid all the time.

1055
00:51:57,047 --> 00:51:58,782
But meanwhile,
His parents and his brothers

1056
00:51:58,817 --> 00:52:00,048
And his sisters

1057
00:52:00,083 --> 00:52:02,034
All worked at his dad's
Restaurant downtown,

1058
00:52:02,069 --> 00:52:03,986
called cantone's,
In the business district.

1059
00:52:04,421 --> 00:52:06,589
And they all thought
Mario was creative.

1060
00:52:06,590 --> 00:52:07,856
You know what i mean?

1061
00:52:07,891 --> 00:52:10,059
And he was kinda like floating,
He was letting them pretend.

1062
00:52:10,060 --> 00:52:12,228
He was like,
Here's my girlfriend, gena-

1063
00:52:12,229 --> 00:52:13,964
You know what i mean, like
He's passing the girls off?

1064
00:52:14,397 --> 00:52:16,565
And so all of his brothers,
You know,

1065
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:20,036
And his family
Believed that he was straight.

1066
00:52:20,470 --> 00:52:22,638
But the truth was,
On any given night,

1067
00:52:22,639 --> 00:52:24,807
After like half a vodka tonic
And two bong hits,

1068
00:52:24,808 --> 00:52:27,844
This would happen:

1069
00:52:30,013 --> 00:52:32,615
Yeah.

1070
00:52:37,387 --> 00:52:39,989
So, later that year,
His mother finds it,

1071
00:52:39,990 --> 00:52:40,822
She frames it,

1072
00:52:40,857 --> 00:52:42,158
And she hangs it
Behind the bar

1073
00:52:42,159 --> 00:52:43,859
At the fucking restaurant,
Right?

1074
00:52:43,894 --> 00:52:45,629
So i'm sitting there one night
With mario's brother, dominick,

1075
00:52:45,664 --> 00:52:47,797
Who's like one of these fuckin'
Guys, "eh-eh," you know?

1076
00:52:47,832 --> 00:52:50,833
Like completely
Fuckin' clueless.

1077
00:52:50,834 --> 00:52:52,534
And he's looking
At the picture,

1078
00:52:52,569 --> 00:52:53,870
And he goes, "yeah,
That fucking mario, man.

1079
00:52:53,905 --> 00:52:58,207
He's so fucking
Creative, huh?"

1080
00:52:58,208 --> 00:52:59,908
And i'm like,
"Yeah, dominick,

1081
00:52:59,943 --> 00:53:02,545
I'm creative, too, but
I don't have cum in my hair. "

1082
00:53:02,546 --> 00:53:06,016
You know
What i mean?

1083
00:53:06,051 --> 00:53:07,716
You know?

1084
00:53:07,751 --> 00:53:09,052
I love kiefer, man,
He flew in tonight.

1085
00:53:09,486 --> 00:53:10,787
You should give him
A round of applause.

1086
00:53:10,822 --> 00:53:12,522
The fucking guy flew in.

1087
00:53:12,956 --> 00:53:14,257
Yeah.

1088
00:53:14,691 --> 00:53:16,859
Yeah.

1089
00:53:19,029 --> 00:53:20,764
I know jon stewart did
A roll-in tonight

1090
00:53:20,799 --> 00:53:22,030
Which was really
Nice of him.

1091
00:53:22,065 --> 00:53:23,765
And he was actually
Supposed to be here,

1092
00:53:23,800 --> 00:53:25,535
But someone put his car keys
On top of his t. V.

1093
00:53:25,969 --> 00:53:27,235
And he's still
Trying to reach them.

1094
00:53:27,270 --> 00:53:32,908
So he might make it
If somebody drops by his house.

1095
00:53:32,909 --> 00:53:36,379
Adam ferrara.

1096
00:53:36,813 --> 00:53:39,415
You filthy
Guinea motherfucker.

1097
00:53:39,416 --> 00:53:41,116
You lucky little whore,

1098
00:53:41,151 --> 00:53:45,054
That i fucking hired you and
Bought your fucking house.

1099
00:53:45,488 --> 00:53:48,958
And this photo confirms

1100
00:53:48,959 --> 00:53:51,092
What we've all been
Suspecting for years.

1101
00:53:51,127 --> 00:53:53,729
This is adam napping after
A post-goat barbecue

1102
00:53:53,730 --> 00:53:54,996
During
The annual splinter cell

1103
00:53:55,031 --> 00:54:01,103
And terrorist picnic
And hidden-explosives expo.

1104
00:54:01,538 --> 00:54:03,706
Last but not least,
Lenny clarke.

1105
00:54:03,707 --> 00:54:06,708
My old friend.

1106
00:54:06,743 --> 00:54:08,044
You know, we actually
Had a tough time

1107
00:54:08,079 --> 00:54:09,345
With this category,

1108
00:54:09,346 --> 00:54:11,297
Because there were
So many fucking stories.

1109
00:54:11,332 --> 00:54:13,249
And they're all true and
They're all hilarious.

1110
00:54:13,250 --> 00:54:15,852
But we had to wean
Them down for time.

1111
00:54:15,887 --> 00:54:18,454
I wanna tell you
This one story.

1112
00:54:18,888 --> 00:54:21,056
Back in the late '70s,
I think it was the '70s.

1113
00:54:21,057 --> 00:54:22,792
Was it the '70s when you
Ran for city council

1114
00:54:22,827 --> 00:54:24,093
Or was that '80s?

1115
00:54:24,527 --> 00:54:25,394
'70s.

1116
00:54:25,829 --> 00:54:27,564
Late '70s,
In cambridge, massachusetts,

1117
00:54:27,998 --> 00:54:29,299
Where lenny was born
And brought up,

1118
00:54:29,334 --> 00:54:30,565
The rule about
Running for office is

1119
00:54:30,600 --> 00:54:32,551
If you declare that you're
Gonna run for office,

1120
00:54:32,586 --> 00:54:34,503
You, you, whoever,
You immediately get some money

1121
00:54:34,504 --> 00:54:37,106
To print up buttons
And bumper stickers.

1122
00:54:37,107 --> 00:54:38,807
Lenny is a janitor
At that point,

1123
00:54:38,842 --> 00:54:40,577
And he goes, "guys, i'm fucking
Running for mayor. "

1124
00:54:40,612 --> 00:54:42,312
We were like,
"Mayor of what?"

1125
00:54:42,347 --> 00:54:43,578
He was like, "cambridge!"

1126
00:54:43,613 --> 00:54:45,348
We were like,
"You can't run for mayor. "

1127
00:54:45,383 --> 00:54:46,215
He was like,
"Anybody can run!

1128
00:54:46,216 --> 00:54:47,916
I'm fucking doing it!"

1129
00:54:47,951 --> 00:54:48,818
I said, "what's
Your platform?"

1130
00:54:49,252 --> 00:54:53,589
"Fuck the kennedys!
That's my platform. "

1131
00:54:53,590 --> 00:54:55,758
So he goes down, he fills out
All these things,

1132
00:54:55,759 --> 00:54:59,229
And he gets "fuck the kennedys"
Bumper stickers printed up.

1133
00:54:59,264 --> 00:55:01,397
"Fuck the kennedys,
Vote for lenny," right?

1134
00:55:01,398 --> 00:55:06,603
So, about four weeks
Into the campaign,

1135
00:55:07,037 --> 00:55:08,338
Nobody fucking knows
What's going on.

1136
00:55:08,772 --> 00:55:11,374
There's crazy "fuck
The kennedys" bumper stickers everywhere.

1137
00:55:11,409 --> 00:55:12,675
Who's lenny?

1138
00:55:12,676 --> 00:55:14,376
All this shit.

1139
00:55:14,411 --> 00:55:15,243
Lenny goes,
"I need something

1140
00:55:15,278 --> 00:55:16,579
"To fucking spark interest
In my campaign.

1141
00:55:16,614 --> 00:55:18,314
"I'm gonna steal a city bus

1142
00:55:18,315 --> 00:55:19,581
"And i'm gonna
Drive it around.

1143
00:55:19,616 --> 00:55:21,784
And then people will know
Who i am. "

1144
00:55:21,785 --> 00:55:22,617
He was drunk.

1145
00:55:22,652 --> 00:55:23,918
We were like,
"Yeah, yeah, yeah. "

1146
00:55:23,953 --> 00:55:26,989
The next day, he goes out
And he steals a fucking bus.

1147
00:55:26,990 --> 00:55:28,941
Drives it down mass ave,
Through boston,

1148
00:55:28,976 --> 00:55:30,893
Across the bridge
Into cambridge, right?

1149
00:55:31,328 --> 00:55:32,160
And halfway through,

1150
00:55:32,195 --> 00:55:34,797
He's realizing,
"It's just me driving a bus.

1151
00:55:35,231 --> 00:55:37,399
This is no good. "

1152
00:55:37,400 --> 00:55:40,436
So he starts
To pick people up.

1153
00:55:40,437 --> 00:55:42,570
He's fucking picking
People up.

1154
00:55:42,605 --> 00:55:44,773
People aren't even at bus stops,
He's going, "get in!"

1155
00:55:45,208 --> 00:55:47,376
And he tells them,
"I'm gonna drop you off,

1156
00:55:47,377 --> 00:55:49,545
"Right in front of
Your fucking house.

1157
00:55:49,979 --> 00:55:51,280
"And you tell the cops,
When they ask,

1158
00:55:51,281 --> 00:55:56,052
Lenny fucking clarke dropped
You off in front of your house. "

1159
00:55:56,087 --> 00:56:01,257
I swear to god.

1160
00:56:02,992 --> 00:56:04,727
You guys have been great.

1161
00:56:04,728 --> 00:56:06,896
I fucking love him,
I hate the rest of you.

1162
00:56:06,931 --> 00:56:09,932
Thank you very much.

1163
00:56:16,005 --> 00:56:17,740
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

1164
00:56:17,741 --> 00:56:20,777
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

1165
00:56:25,982 --> 00:56:28,584
Denis!

1166
00:56:28,585 --> 00:56:30,970
You can't leave
Your own roast

1167
00:56:31,005 --> 00:56:33,321
Without doing
The song, bro!

1168
00:56:33,356 --> 00:56:37,259
It's gonna be
In our hearts forever!

1169
00:56:37,260 --> 00:56:41,163
I know in my heart, when you
Were gonna do that song,

1170
00:56:41,164 --> 00:56:42,864
Part of you was like,

1171
00:56:42,899 --> 00:56:45,935
"We're gonna fuckin'
Tear it up, okay?

1172
00:56:45,970 --> 00:56:47,236
"We're gonna go out here,

1173
00:56:47,670 --> 00:56:50,272
And 'asshole',
And belt this shit out, okay?"

1174
00:56:50,273 --> 00:56:53,526
I knew that
Was in you, bro.

1175
00:56:53,561 --> 00:56:56,779
I just- i still love it.

1176
00:56:56,780 --> 00:56:58,515
And i'll love it
Forever.

1177
00:56:58,948 --> 00:57:02,418
