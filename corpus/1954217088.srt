1
00:01:51,311 --> 00:01:56,044
Regrets in life

2
00:01:56,316 --> 00:02:04,052
must be endured.

3
00:02:59,846 --> 00:03:03,805
So this is truly the so-called "naive".

4
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:10,084
You must have a lot of time.

5
00:03:13,126 --> 00:03:15,890
Distant mountain ranges.

6
00:03:18,164 --> 00:03:20,632
Flowing clouds and mist.

7
00:03:27,073 --> 00:03:30,440
A huge area of white here.

8
00:03:45,692 --> 00:03:48,627
You must be happy in the mountains.

9
00:03:51,864 --> 00:03:55,197
But many people are looking for you.

10
00:03:58,404 --> 00:04:00,929
Why am I writing this?

11
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:13,084
You open the inbox, but no e-mail.

12
00:04:13,319 --> 00:04:15,583
That means I didn't send it to you.

13
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:19,820
Which means I haven't finished it.

14
00:04:20,193 --> 00:04:22,684
If I haven't finished it,

15
00:04:25,198 --> 00:04:27,428
Rush, rush.

16
00:04:27,567 --> 00:04:31,025
What's the use of rushing?

17
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:34,271
Stop calling, please!

18
00:05:39,605 --> 00:05:45,066
Time passes by,

19
00:05:46,379 --> 00:05:53,615
to staying here awhile...

20
00:06:38,364 --> 00:06:39,854
Hello.

21
00:06:43,603 --> 00:06:45,400
I'm heading off to work.

22
00:06:49,609 --> 00:06:51,804
I do care...

23
00:06:52,812 --> 00:06:53,972
I don't want it rebuilt.

24
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,674
Or tear down the house, either.

25
00:06:56,783 --> 00:06:59,251
I've already said this many times.

26
00:07:00,953 --> 00:07:03,080
Dad hasn't decided yet.

27
00:07:03,156 --> 00:07:05,522
No matter what I say is useless.

28
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:12,029
So...

29
00:07:12,165 --> 00:07:13,826
Mom!

30
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,628
I can only make a suggestion.

31
00:07:16,702 --> 00:07:18,795
I can't make any decisions.

32
00:07:19,639 --> 00:07:20,605
OK.

33
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:22,369
I have to go to work.

34
00:07:22,542 --> 00:07:23,065
I'm going to be late.

35
00:07:23,176 --> 00:07:24,609
I'll call later.

36
00:07:25,044 --> 00:07:25,976
OK.

37
00:07:26,212 --> 00:07:26,735
OK.

38
00:07:26,979 --> 00:07:28,674
Bye-bye.

39
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:53,666
How could this be?

40
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:05,813
A slide is missing...

41
00:08:37,483 --> 00:08:39,041
Hey!

42
00:08:39,719 --> 00:08:41,550
Hey!

43
00:09:00,373 --> 00:09:02,238
You're lucky this time.

44
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:08,275
Sit down!

45
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:09,606
Hurry!

46
00:09:09,849 --> 00:09:11,680
Morning!

47
00:09:12,418 --> 00:09:14,409
Sit down...

48
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:38,741
Last time,

49
00:09:38,978 --> 00:09:42,709
talking about World War II,

50
00:09:42,882 --> 00:09:46,374
how we transported valuable objects

51
00:09:46,652 --> 00:09:48,813
away from the front line.

52
00:09:49,655 --> 00:09:52,624
It sure was a chaotic time.

53
00:09:52,858 --> 00:09:54,052
Enemy planes

54
00:09:54,293 --> 00:09:55,385
would appear anytime and drop bombs.

55
00:09:55,628 --> 00:09:58,028
So no one wanted to move the art.

56
00:09:58,497 --> 00:10:01,898
I was quite young

57
00:10:03,703 --> 00:10:05,193
at that time.

58
00:10:05,438 --> 00:10:07,167
And I was bold.

59
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:10,365
I said,

60
00:10:10,843 --> 00:10:11,707
"OK,

61
00:10:11,944 --> 00:10:15,710
I'll do it."

62
00:10:17,516 --> 00:10:20,620
The night was best for transporting.

63
00:10:20,655 --> 00:10:23,020
There's no bombing at night.

64
00:10:24,123 --> 00:10:28,025
It was safer.

65
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:29,625
But,

66
00:10:29,862 --> 00:10:33,457
there was something else to fear -

67
00:10:33,532 --> 00:10:36,365
bandits,

68
00:10:36,435 --> 00:10:39,734
bandits who took advantage to

69
00:10:39,805 --> 00:10:43,468
rob in the chaos of war.

70
00:11:03,596 --> 00:11:05,564
Hey!

71
00:11:05,765 --> 00:11:07,756
You braked too fast!

72
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,399
Sorry...

73
00:11:09,635 --> 00:11:11,830
The brake linings were just replaced.

74
00:11:16,676 --> 00:11:18,166
The topic I want to discuss today

75
00:11:18,411 --> 00:11:21,312
is "time" in Chinese painting,

76
00:11:21,614 --> 00:11:25,414
especially when looking at painting,

77
00:11:26,185 --> 00:11:29,086
since the act itself is fluid.

78
00:11:29,321 --> 00:11:31,721
The sense of time in a painting

79
00:11:31,957 --> 00:11:34,755
is the passage through a piece.

80
00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:40,858
This topic is perhaps a bit difficult.

81
00:11:41,434 --> 00:11:45,234
Let's look at some slides.

82
00:11:54,213 --> 00:11:55,475
This painting is Hsia Kuei's

83
00:11:55,715 --> 00:11:58,115
Remote View of Streams and Hills.

84
00:11:58,350 --> 00:12:02,548
This scroll is 889.1cm long.

85
00:12:02,922 --> 00:12:05,356
The piece utilizes spontaneous dots

86
00:12:05,591 --> 00:12:07,388
and lines with exaggerated washes,

87
00:12:07,626 --> 00:12:10,356
forming the texture of the mountains.

88
00:12:11,931 --> 00:12:13,728
As you look at this piece,

89
00:12:13,966 --> 00:12:17,561
we go from right to left.

90
00:12:17,770 --> 00:12:19,169
You will feel a strong

91
00:12:19,271 --> 00:12:21,205
sense of time.

92
00:12:21,273 --> 00:12:24,731
This sense of time is very tight.

93
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:31,439
Next is Chao Meng-fu's Autumn Colors
on the Ch'iao and Hua Mountains.

94
00:12:32,218 --> 00:12:39,215
The details are memories of antiquity.

95
00:12:39,458 --> 00:12:40,015
I feel...

96
00:12:40,092 --> 00:12:45,655
it gives the sense of a dreamland.

97
00:12:56,509 --> 00:13:01,879
This was supposed to be Autumn Colors
on the Ch'iao and Hua Mountains.

98
00:13:02,948 --> 00:13:04,415
I guess I must have dropped
the slide this morning

99
00:13:04,483 --> 00:13:05,950
when I was cleaning up.

100
00:13:06,018 --> 00:13:08,111
Sorry about that.

101
00:13:08,354 --> 00:13:11,346
But I'll make sure I find it.

102
00:13:13,793 --> 00:13:17,786
Of course, I should still explain it...

103
00:13:25,604 --> 00:13:27,572
Please.

104
00:13:31,277 --> 00:13:33,609
Please!

105
00:13:33,846 --> 00:13:35,905
Please!

106
00:13:36,148 --> 00:13:38,309
Please...

107
00:13:39,018 --> 00:13:41,578
What in the world are you thinking?

108
00:13:42,454 --> 00:13:43,386
It's just a cave, right?

109
00:13:43,455 --> 00:13:45,218
What's so beautiful about it?

110
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:50,353
Please...

111
00:13:52,064 --> 00:13:54,464
Everyone has dreams.

112
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:56,759
Please.

113
00:14:04,343 --> 00:14:07,369
Please!

114
00:14:09,949 --> 00:14:13,282
Everyone needs dreams!

115
00:14:13,586 --> 00:14:16,419
Please.

116
00:14:17,656 --> 00:14:19,556
Please!

117
00:14:19,725 --> 00:14:22,717
Everyone needs dreams!

118
00:14:22,962 --> 00:14:25,692
Please!

119
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:30,968
It's no use.

120
00:14:33,606 --> 00:14:35,335
Old people...

121
00:14:35,441 --> 00:14:37,272
they're all like this.

122
00:14:37,509 --> 00:14:38,567
You...

123
00:14:38,611 --> 00:14:41,045
You know how to get your way.

124
00:14:41,146 --> 00:14:43,910
No wonder my father forgets who I am.

125
00:14:44,116 --> 00:14:47,017
But he always remembers you.

126
00:14:53,459 --> 00:15:00,524
How is the old man's health?

127
00:15:10,643 --> 00:15:11,974
Remember...

128
00:15:12,211 --> 00:15:14,145
The space between solid and void

129
00:15:14,246 --> 00:15:17,010
must be continuous.

130
00:15:35,801 --> 00:15:37,735
Get that!

131
00:15:48,681 --> 00:15:49,841
Message

132
00:15:49,982 --> 00:15:52,007
Hand in your paper, big author!

133
00:16:25,718 --> 00:16:27,185
That's all for today.

134
00:16:27,419 --> 00:16:29,250
You can go.

135
00:16:44,036 --> 00:16:44,730
Good morning.

136
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:46,904
There's a letter for you, Ching.

137
00:16:47,039 --> 00:16:48,028
Oh.

138
00:16:48,273 --> 00:16:49,672
Thank you.

139
00:17:23,275 --> 00:17:27,735
Another? Why waste money?
Just write an e-mail.

140
00:17:30,749 --> 00:17:33,411
I like letters! Please...

141
00:17:42,428 --> 00:17:44,396
Whatever. Whatever makes you happy.

142
00:17:44,431 --> 00:17:46,660
Thanks. How is he?

143
00:17:56,909 --> 00:18:01,312
I don't know. He's hiding again. I'm busy.
I don't want to deal with you two.

144
00:18:01,613 --> 00:18:05,208
Are you mad or jealous?

145
00:18:13,492 --> 00:18:15,084
I was going to ask you that.

146
00:18:15,227 --> 00:18:18,059
Would your husband be angry

147
00:18:18,094 --> 00:18:20,891
if you wrote to old lovers?

148
00:18:32,377 --> 00:18:37,610
"Flying Birds and Fish"...is offline.

149
00:18:42,654 --> 00:18:43,712
Hey!

150
00:18:43,956 --> 00:18:45,548
Your turn to take a picture.

151
00:18:45,724 --> 00:18:47,385
OK?

152
00:18:48,594 --> 00:18:49,253
Ching.

153
00:18:49,495 --> 00:18:50,985
Come take your picture together.

154
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:52,720
Coming.

155
00:18:57,002 --> 00:18:57,900
Hey...

156
00:18:58,137 --> 00:18:58,728
Didn't photograph your face.

157
00:18:58,837 --> 00:19:00,065
One more time.

158
00:19:00,305 --> 00:19:03,069
One... Two... Three...

159
00:19:03,709 --> 00:19:04,266
OK.

160
00:19:04,543 --> 00:19:05,475
Thank you.

161
00:19:33,572 --> 00:19:43,277
Why'd you come to this island?

162
00:19:45,217 --> 00:19:56,890
Just because of the war? Or...

163
00:20:00,465 --> 00:20:04,094
Stop thinking too much.

164
00:20:04,336 --> 00:20:05,894
I'll take care of it.

165
00:20:06,138 --> 00:20:07,605
OK, that's all.

166
00:20:25,324 --> 00:20:25,915
Excuse me...

167
00:20:25,958 --> 00:20:26,424
Sorry.

168
00:20:26,491 --> 00:20:28,152
Do you know...

169
00:20:28,694 --> 00:20:31,857
Do you know how to find this address?

170
00:20:32,297 --> 00:20:34,231
I think it's a karaoke club.

171
00:20:34,399 --> 00:20:35,024
This one?

172
00:20:35,234 --> 00:20:37,964
Turn left and you'll see it.

173
00:20:38,303 --> 00:20:38,826
It's very close.

174
00:20:38,904 --> 00:20:40,701
Just turn left at the traffic light, right?

175
00:20:40,872 --> 00:20:41,566
That's it.

176
00:20:41,673 --> 00:20:42,765
Thank you.

177
00:20:43,008 --> 00:20:43,531
No problem.

178
00:20:43,609 --> 00:20:45,372
Thanks.

179
00:20:52,017 --> 00:20:52,684
Here's your order.

180
00:20:52,719 --> 00:20:54,049
OK.

181
00:20:57,256 --> 00:20:58,723
Please.

182
00:20:59,458 --> 00:21:00,891
Enjoy.

183
00:21:04,096 --> 00:21:04,653
May I ask...

184
00:21:04,997 --> 00:21:07,761
Are you Japanese?

185
00:21:08,533 --> 00:21:09,522
Excuse me?
You can tell?

186
00:21:09,768 --> 00:21:11,531
I knew right away.

187
00:21:11,703 --> 00:21:13,295
Oh...

188
00:21:15,941 --> 00:21:17,772
Are you a tourist here?

189
00:21:18,010 --> 00:21:21,002
No, I'm here for work.

190
00:21:21,246 --> 00:21:22,338
When did you get here?

191
00:21:22,614 --> 00:21:23,808
Today.

192
00:21:24,049 --> 00:21:24,538
Oh, I see.

193
00:21:24,850 --> 00:21:26,215
Well, enjoy!

194
00:21:34,326 --> 00:21:36,760
Welcome!

195
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:44,498
Oh, yeah...

196
00:21:44,736 --> 00:21:50,902
You know a work
called Cold Food Observance?

197
00:21:51,143 --> 00:21:52,371
The Cold Food Observance?

198
00:21:52,477 --> 00:21:54,445
Yes.

199
00:21:54,713 --> 00:21:57,011
Never heard of it.

200
00:21:57,983 --> 00:21:59,450
In Chinese it's called...

201
00:21:59,651 --> 00:22:02,415
Han-shih t'ieh.

202
00:22:02,721 --> 00:22:04,484
Really...

203
00:22:06,391 --> 00:22:08,621
Sorry, I don't know it.

204
00:22:08,894 --> 00:22:10,088
I see.

205
00:22:10,429 --> 00:22:11,794
That's OK.

206
00:22:11,829 --> 00:22:13,160
Never mind.

207
00:22:27,913 --> 00:22:28,641
Long time no see.

208
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:31,039
Long time no see.

209
00:22:31,249 --> 00:22:31,943
Mr. "Late".

210
00:22:32,017 --> 00:22:33,712
What took you so long?

211
00:22:33,952 --> 00:22:35,681
Who can find this place?

212
00:22:35,854 --> 00:22:37,583
I walked for over an hour.

213
00:22:37,656 --> 00:22:39,590
I looked for a long time!

214
00:22:39,825 --> 00:22:40,689
You always get lost.

215
00:22:40,926 --> 00:22:41,585
Come on.

216
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:42,388
You're like this every time.

217
00:22:43,829 --> 00:22:45,558
Look who's here.

218
00:22:45,897 --> 00:22:48,127
Dong-heng.

219
00:22:50,869 --> 00:22:52,302
Dou-dou.

220
00:22:52,371 --> 00:22:54,566
Look at this crazy woman.

221
00:22:55,073 --> 00:22:55,630
Long time no see.

222
00:22:55,874 --> 00:22:56,636
Long time no see.

223
00:22:56,908 --> 00:22:58,637
What have you been up to?

224
00:22:58,910 --> 00:22:59,706
Have a seat.

225
00:22:59,978 --> 00:23:01,878
Come on.

226
00:23:09,488 --> 00:23:10,785
Have a drink.

227
00:23:11,056 --> 00:23:12,580
Let me eat something.

228
00:23:12,824 --> 00:23:15,657
You're going to kill me.

229
00:23:17,229 --> 00:23:19,857
Drink up. Drink up.

230
00:23:24,269 --> 00:23:25,566
Still some left. Hurry up.

231
00:23:26,905 --> 00:23:29,840
Still a little bit left. Hurry, hurry.

232
00:23:32,377 --> 00:23:33,309
That's good.

233
00:23:33,445 --> 00:23:35,612
Dong-heng's map

234
00:23:35,647 --> 00:23:37,171
only has two landmarks in it.

235
00:23:37,382 --> 00:23:38,679
The first is his house.

236
00:23:38,950 --> 00:23:41,885
The other is that of Wu Yi-ssu.

237
00:23:42,654 --> 00:23:44,554
No.

238
00:23:44,656 --> 00:23:45,179
This landmark

239
00:23:45,424 --> 00:23:48,160
has run off to America.

240
00:23:48,195 --> 00:23:48,854
What's with you?

241
00:23:48,894 --> 00:23:51,362
You're lost all day long.

242
00:23:52,364 --> 00:23:53,262
So?

243
00:23:53,465 --> 00:23:56,366
You've a new goal? A new landmark?

244
00:23:56,468 --> 00:23:57,093
Oh.

245
00:23:57,169 --> 00:23:58,761
Do you have a new landmark?

246
00:23:59,037 --> 00:23:59,594
No...

247
00:23:59,738 --> 00:24:01,000
What've you been writing about?

248
00:24:01,373 --> 00:24:02,974
Just stuff.
What kind of stuff?

249
00:24:03,009 --> 00:24:03,540
Cut it out.

250
00:24:03,575 --> 00:24:04,872
You always say you're writing.

251
00:24:05,243 --> 00:24:08,178
He's probably writing a Taipei guide.

252
00:24:09,247 --> 00:24:09,804
Come on.

253
00:24:09,915 --> 00:24:10,381
Let me take a look.

254
00:24:10,415 --> 00:24:10,938
What's that?

255
00:24:11,016 --> 00:24:11,482
Let me take a look.

256
00:24:11,516 --> 00:24:12,744
Let me see.

257
00:24:12,918 --> 00:24:14,442
I'm writing this...

258
00:24:14,586 --> 00:24:16,850
The National Palace Museum
wants me to write a story.

259
00:24:16,955 --> 00:24:18,718
What is this?

260
00:24:18,924 --> 00:24:19,891
Let me see.

261
00:24:20,158 --> 00:24:22,626
My friend just cast it this afternoon.

262
00:24:23,094 --> 00:24:24,220
Careful.

263
00:24:24,362 --> 00:24:25,920
Please!

264
00:24:26,698 --> 00:24:27,665
Don't be so rough.

265
00:24:27,933 --> 00:24:29,298
I need to give it back to him.

266
00:24:29,601 --> 00:24:31,000
Be careful!

267
00:24:35,540 --> 00:24:37,474
Don't look at it.

268
00:24:37,509 --> 00:24:38,032
Look,

269
00:24:38,109 --> 00:24:38,905
in five hundred years,

270
00:24:38,977 --> 00:24:42,037
this cup will just be like that.

271
00:24:42,781 --> 00:24:44,214
Who wants to hear this stuff?

272
00:24:44,349 --> 00:24:44,940
I'll have one.

273
00:24:45,050 --> 00:24:46,108
I'll have one.

274
00:24:46,451 --> 00:24:47,383
My turn.

275
00:24:47,419 --> 00:24:49,182
My turn.

276
00:24:50,121 --> 00:24:52,351
Don't bump!

277
00:26:03,161 --> 00:26:04,194
To Mr. Li Dong-heng

278
00:26:04,229 --> 00:26:05,753
c/o Chen Yu-ching

279
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:15,859
Hello?

280
00:27:16,101 --> 00:27:18,296
Mom.

281
00:27:25,610 --> 00:27:26,542
Mom?

282
00:27:26,711 --> 00:27:27,678
I've told you a hundred times.

283
00:27:27,746 --> 00:27:29,941
I'm against it.

284
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:36,987
That's where I grew up.

285
00:27:37,055 --> 00:27:38,920
I don't want it torn down.

286
00:27:49,601 --> 00:27:51,796
Mom.

287
00:27:52,604 --> 00:27:54,299
I know.

288
00:27:56,941 --> 00:28:01,139
Just think of me as a dreamer, OK?

289
00:28:01,713 --> 00:28:03,681
But...

290
00:28:08,586 --> 00:28:11,111
Mom, I have friends over.

291
00:28:12,991 --> 00:28:15,221
I'll call you later.

292
00:28:16,361 --> 00:28:17,191
OK.

293
00:28:17,328 --> 00:28:18,522
Bye-bye.

294
00:28:18,697 --> 00:28:20,164
Bye.

295
00:30:13,278 --> 00:30:13,835
Look.

296
00:30:13,912 --> 00:30:15,573
Actually, from this work by Mi Fu,

297
00:30:15,914 --> 00:30:19,406
you can see his rich brushwork.

298
00:30:20,985 --> 00:30:23,215
No wonder he is representative of

299
00:30:23,454 --> 00:30:25,945
the Four Sung Masters.

300
00:30:34,532 --> 00:30:36,090
For me.

301
00:30:41,906 --> 00:30:44,306
Hello? This is Chen Yu-ching.

302
00:30:48,246 --> 00:30:50,339
Yes! Yes!

303
00:31:00,358 --> 00:31:03,691
You say you can take me inside?

304
00:31:06,431 --> 00:31:08,729
Really?

305
00:31:11,369 --> 00:31:13,599
I can go in the cave.

306
00:31:18,977 --> 00:31:20,171
OK.

307
00:31:20,411 --> 00:31:22,402
Thank you.

308
00:31:22,647 --> 00:31:23,113
OK.

309
00:31:23,348 --> 00:31:24,315
I know.

310
00:31:24,616 --> 00:31:25,878
Bye-bye.

311
00:31:48,806 --> 00:31:50,865
After I came to Taiwan...

312
00:31:51,042 --> 00:31:52,031
Uh...

313
00:31:52,277 --> 00:31:53,835
I searched everywhere,

314
00:31:54,078 --> 00:31:57,514
searching for a long time.

315
00:31:57,749 --> 00:32:00,547
To find a suitable place.

316
00:32:00,785 --> 00:32:03,618
This place is near the mountains.

317
00:32:04,389 --> 00:32:07,449
Everyone said it was good.

318
00:32:08,092 --> 00:32:09,320
OK.

319
00:32:09,594 --> 00:32:13,690
We took these works that survived

320
00:32:13,932 --> 00:32:15,957
the war and dug a cave

321
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:18,691
to hide them in.

322
00:32:19,304 --> 00:32:20,862
But how deep

323
00:32:20,972 --> 00:32:24,464
was deep enough?

324
00:33:05,883 --> 00:33:07,714
Thank you.

325
00:33:27,105 --> 00:33:29,972
Who's that guy?

326
00:33:30,808 --> 00:33:31,968
That Japanese guy?

327
00:33:32,310 --> 00:33:34,175
He asked if Cold Food Observance
was on display.

328
00:33:34,379 --> 00:33:35,209
When I told him it wasn't,

329
00:33:35,413 --> 00:33:37,176
he looked dumbfounded.

330
00:33:37,782 --> 00:33:39,477
That's weird.

331
00:33:41,085 --> 00:33:44,418
I thought it was a guy you dumped,

332
00:33:44,655 --> 00:33:46,145
asking for another chance.

333
00:33:46,391 --> 00:33:47,153
I was afraid to come over.

334
00:33:47,392 --> 00:33:49,087
You think too much.

335
00:33:52,263 --> 00:33:53,628
Hey...

336
00:33:53,898 --> 00:33:55,729
Guess what?

337
00:33:56,801 --> 00:33:59,463
I can go into the cave.

338
00:33:59,537 --> 00:34:00,697
Really?

339
00:34:00,805 --> 00:34:03,433
Guess your stubbornness paid off.

340
00:34:10,848 --> 00:34:13,578
Ladies and gentlemen,

341
00:34:14,585 --> 00:34:17,247
now on to the bronze exhibit.

342
00:34:17,488 --> 00:34:19,820
Please follow me.

343
00:34:38,676 --> 00:34:45,582
This is a classic early
Northern Sung landscape.

344
00:34:46,884 --> 00:34:49,876
Fan K'uan lived in the mountains,

345
00:34:50,121 --> 00:34:51,748
staring at the views every day.

346
00:34:51,989 --> 00:34:59,259
His bold brush made great scenery,

347
00:34:59,564 --> 00:35:05,230
showing the eternity of the north.

348
00:35:05,303 --> 00:35:09,535
The near distance in the painting

349
00:35:09,874 --> 00:35:13,037
is split into two portions

350
00:35:13,311 --> 00:35:16,838
by a road left blank on the silk.

351
00:35:16,914 --> 00:35:22,546
Mules enter from the right,

352
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:26,954
highlighting the subject of travel...

353
00:35:30,027 --> 00:35:31,892
Excuse me.

354
00:35:32,864 --> 00:35:35,424
Sure.

355
00:35:35,833 --> 00:35:40,202
That... stamp.

356
00:35:41,806 --> 00:35:43,019
This?

357
00:35:43,054 --> 00:35:44,232
Yes.

358
00:35:45,276 --> 00:35:50,612
In the gift shop in the lobby,

359
00:35:50,848 --> 00:35:51,872
OK.

360
00:35:52,116 --> 00:35:59,079
You can buy stamps and albums there.

361
00:35:59,323 --> 00:36:00,585
Really?

362
00:36:00,825 --> 00:36:03,089
Thank you.

363
00:36:04,729 --> 00:36:06,356
I bought some last time,

364
00:36:06,597 --> 00:36:07,063
but

365
00:36:07,298 --> 00:36:08,890
it was different.

366
00:36:09,133 --> 00:36:10,998
You speak Chinese!

367
00:36:11,235 --> 00:36:13,226
A little.

368
00:36:14,105 --> 00:36:15,333
You work here?

369
00:36:15,573 --> 00:36:17,541
Yeah.

370
00:36:19,310 --> 00:36:24,441
Have you seen
the real Cold Food Observance?

371
00:36:24,615 --> 00:36:25,673
I work here.

372
00:36:25,917 --> 00:36:27,578
Everything I see is an original.

373
00:36:27,818 --> 00:36:29,649
Oh.

374
00:36:31,956 --> 00:36:34,686
What's it feel like?

375
00:36:39,597 --> 00:36:42,361
It feels... real.

376
00:36:48,439 --> 00:36:50,566
May I ask...

377
00:36:50,741 --> 00:36:55,576
Can you take me to storage?

378
00:36:57,882 --> 00:37:00,407
Why?

379
00:37:01,118 --> 00:37:02,779
I'd like to...

380
00:37:03,020 --> 00:37:05,147
I'd like to see it.

381
00:37:08,893 --> 00:37:10,690
That's not allowed.

382
00:37:10,928 --> 00:37:13,522
I can't take you down.

383
00:37:19,837 --> 00:37:22,101
Oh, I see.

384
00:37:26,110 --> 00:37:28,544
Looks like

385
00:37:29,113 --> 00:37:32,549
you really want to see that piece.

386
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:18,184
Big author.

387
00:39:20,358 --> 00:39:22,826
You've finally shown up.

388
00:39:23,661 --> 00:39:25,561
If you stay lost any longer,

389
00:39:25,796 --> 00:39:28,196
our boss might jump in the river!

390
00:39:59,630 --> 00:40:00,858
Hey.

391
00:40:01,065 --> 00:40:02,794
That Japanese guy

392
00:40:02,967 --> 00:40:05,367
over there

393
00:40:05,603 --> 00:40:07,901
says he wants to see
Cold Food Observance.

394
00:40:08,506 --> 00:40:10,838
But it's not on display right now.

395
00:40:11,809 --> 00:40:14,869
He looked so disappointed.

396
00:40:22,353 --> 00:40:24,184
You know,

397
00:40:31,662 --> 00:40:33,721
he asked me

398
00:40:34,598 --> 00:40:37,499
to take him down to storage.

399
00:40:47,578 --> 00:40:50,547
Don't you feel sorry for him?

400
00:40:53,050 --> 00:40:55,109
Why?

401
00:40:57,321 --> 00:40:59,050
OK,

402
00:40:59,290 --> 00:41:01,315
forget it.

403
00:41:01,592 --> 00:41:02,957
Forget it.

404
00:41:13,137 --> 00:41:15,037
Is she doing OK in America?

405
00:41:18,209 --> 00:41:20,609
Did she say when she's coming back?

406
00:41:26,217 --> 00:41:28,014
You know,

407
00:41:29,687 --> 00:41:32,315
I was very upset when she left, too.

408
00:41:37,795 --> 00:41:39,592
You OK?

409
00:41:49,006 --> 00:41:52,305
I can go into the cave.

410
00:41:53,310 --> 00:41:54,709
Two years.

411
00:41:55,012 --> 00:41:57,105
I begged for two whole years before

412
00:41:57,181 --> 00:42:00,582
anyone would take me into cave storage.

413
00:42:04,388 --> 00:42:06,720
A time tunnel of a thousand years,

414
00:42:06,957 --> 00:42:09,425
my dream's finally come true.

415
00:42:12,363 --> 00:42:13,921
Hey...

416
00:42:14,164 --> 00:42:16,689
Let's go get some tea

417
00:42:17,034 --> 00:42:19,559
to celebrate.

418
00:42:20,871 --> 00:42:22,771
Let's go.

419
00:42:24,308 --> 00:42:26,572
I have things to write tonight.

420
00:42:41,225 --> 00:42:43,284
Oh.

421
00:42:44,895 --> 00:42:46,658
Forget it.

422
00:42:47,865 --> 00:42:50,129
I'm busy anyways.

423
00:42:50,801 --> 00:42:53,167
Next time.

424
00:43:11,088 --> 00:43:13,079
I'm getting off.

425
00:43:15,826 --> 00:43:17,555
I've already given you the letter.

426
00:43:17,761 --> 00:43:19,695
Enjoy it.

427
00:43:22,900 --> 00:43:23,924
Hey.

428
00:43:27,605 --> 00:43:29,402
You dropped this.

429
00:43:31,475 --> 00:43:33,340
Hurry up and turn your paper in.

430
00:43:36,113 --> 00:43:36,943
That's weird.

431
00:43:37,047 --> 00:43:38,878
Why are you getting off here?

432
00:43:39,149 --> 00:43:41,310
I'm not allowed to have a date?

433
00:49:18,155 --> 00:49:20,089
Hello?

434
00:49:20,624 --> 00:49:22,023
You still busy?

435
00:49:22,259 --> 00:49:22,725
Yeah.

436
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:24,518
Still writing.

437
00:49:24,761 --> 00:49:26,319
Oh.

438
00:49:27,431 --> 00:49:30,298
I saw that Japanese guy again today.

439
00:49:30,834 --> 00:49:31,892
Oh.

440
00:49:32,135 --> 00:49:34,603
Same one.

441
00:49:34,838 --> 00:49:38,638
The one wanting to see
Cold Food Observance.

442
00:49:39,209 --> 00:49:41,541
He looked very serious.

443
00:49:46,450 --> 00:49:47,007
Oh.

444
00:49:47,084 --> 00:49:48,551
You know what?

445
00:49:48,719 --> 00:49:50,949
When he was at the Museum today,

446
00:49:51,188 --> 00:49:53,452
he had a letter in his hand.

447
00:49:53,690 --> 00:49:57,683
The stamp on it was a quarter of
Cold Food Observance.

448
00:50:00,731 --> 00:50:02,323
I remember...

449
00:50:02,566 --> 00:50:05,535
I remember the letter our friend sent

450
00:50:05,969 --> 00:50:10,372
also had a stamp with a quarter of
Cold Food Observance.

451
00:50:15,912 --> 00:50:16,844
Don't you feel

452
00:50:17,080 --> 00:50:20,777
we should help him a little?

453
00:50:22,452 --> 00:50:24,477
Like how?

454
00:50:25,055 --> 00:50:31,324
Like let him see

455
00:50:32,362 --> 00:50:37,299
an original-size copy of
Cold Food Observance.

456
00:50:40,437 --> 00:50:42,268
I think

457
00:50:42,539 --> 00:50:45,804
he's got an interesting story.

458
00:50:49,246 --> 00:50:49,940
Hey...

459
00:50:50,180 --> 00:50:52,774
Isn't this what you're writing about?

460
00:50:53,016 --> 00:50:54,711
Hey...

461
00:50:54,951 --> 00:50:58,284
How many Japanese
come to the Museum every year?

462
00:50:58,522 --> 00:51:01,286
I have to help every one of them?

463
00:51:03,827 --> 00:51:05,556
Hello?

464
00:51:12,369 --> 00:51:14,633
Did I say something wrong?

465
00:51:15,238 --> 00:51:17,570
No.

466
00:51:18,275 --> 00:51:21,176
You didn't say anything wrong.

467
00:51:22,813 --> 00:51:25,577
It's just you're so cold.

468
00:51:26,883 --> 00:51:29,044
It scared me.

469
00:51:30,954 --> 00:51:31,921
I'm fine.

470
00:51:32,155 --> 00:51:34,419
That's just who I am.

471
00:51:34,658 --> 00:51:35,716
How can you talk like that?

472
00:51:35,859 --> 00:51:37,986
You're so messed up.

473
00:51:41,331 --> 00:51:42,389
If there's nothing else,

474
00:51:42,632 --> 00:51:44,623
I'd like to write.

475
00:51:49,506 --> 00:51:51,440
OK.

476
00:51:51,942 --> 00:51:54,467
Go write your stuff.

477
00:51:55,378 --> 00:51:56,402
Anyways, you don't have a heart,

478
00:51:56,646 --> 00:51:58,910
writing more isn't going to help.

479
00:53:32,042 --> 00:53:41,280
The story of culture destroyed by man.

480
00:53:41,451 --> 00:53:50,655
How many times has this happened?

481
00:55:18,148 --> 00:55:19,672
It took three months

482
00:55:19,916 --> 00:55:22,316
to dig out this cave.

483
00:55:22,719 --> 00:55:26,211
They could have dug to the sea.

484
00:56:05,395 --> 00:56:07,260
Ancient artists

485
00:56:07,564 --> 00:56:10,829
and great craftsmen

486
00:56:11,067 --> 00:56:14,833
all live in this cave.

487
00:56:15,071 --> 00:56:17,801
So when you enter the cave,

488
00:56:18,041 --> 00:56:21,533
you feel its very long,

489
00:56:21,778 --> 00:56:26,681
like you could walk forever.

490
00:56:26,916 --> 00:56:29,544
Those who walk in it

491
00:56:29,719 --> 00:56:33,917
become less and less significant.

492
00:56:35,024 --> 00:56:35,820
In the end,

493
00:56:36,059 --> 00:56:39,995
they just disappear,

494
00:56:40,230 --> 00:56:48,296
while the art lives forever.

495
00:57:57,006 --> 00:57:58,974
Uncle Chao!

496
00:58:10,553 --> 00:58:12,953
Is a museum

497
00:58:13,122 --> 00:58:22,292
also a journey of ancient relics?

498
00:58:23,933 --> 00:58:25,833
That year

499
00:58:26,069 --> 00:58:30,506
was a tense year.

500
00:58:30,573 --> 00:58:32,336
Everyone knew

501
00:58:32,575 --> 00:58:36,341
the war would start any time.

502
00:58:36,513 --> 00:58:43,976
I was an important relic escort.

503
00:58:44,220 --> 00:58:44,879
Uncle Chao,

504
00:58:44,954 --> 00:58:46,216
can you hold on a second?

505
00:58:46,356 --> 00:58:48,483
Let's put this microphone on, OK?

506
00:58:48,591 --> 00:58:50,582
This way I can record you.

507
00:58:55,198 --> 00:58:57,223
Dong-heng.

508
00:58:57,467 --> 00:58:59,935
We've known each other for so long.

509
00:59:00,169 --> 00:59:02,501
Every time I answer your questions.

510
00:59:02,705 --> 00:59:06,038
But you never tell me about you.

511
00:59:06,676 --> 00:59:10,840
Let's talk about you today.

512
00:59:15,218 --> 00:59:18,119
I have no interesting stories.

513
00:59:20,089 --> 00:59:22,523
Why don't you tell me some?

514
00:59:59,829 --> 01:00:01,319
You've come again.

515
01:00:01,564 --> 01:00:02,895
Yes.

516
01:00:08,371 --> 01:00:11,204
Which period of bronzes do you like?

517
01:00:14,577 --> 01:00:16,545
I'm not sure.

518
01:00:19,849 --> 01:00:21,908
Do you want to look at this?

519
01:00:28,691 --> 01:00:30,716
The characters on San P'an Basin

520
01:00:30,960 --> 01:00:32,860
are in seal script.

521
01:00:33,096 --> 01:00:35,360
Do you know these?

522
01:00:38,501 --> 01:00:41,800
Many Chinese artists from long ago

523
01:00:42,805 --> 01:00:46,832
used unique features of seal script.

524
01:00:48,544 --> 01:00:50,671
These unique traits...

525
01:00:51,748 --> 01:00:53,215
I'm sorry.

526
01:00:53,282 --> 01:00:54,806
I don't know too much

527
01:00:54,917 --> 01:00:57,010
about this stuff.

528
01:01:02,325 --> 01:01:06,056
So why are you so interested in
Cold Food Observance?

529
01:01:07,063 --> 01:01:08,928
I'm sorry,

530
01:01:08,998 --> 01:01:12,627
but I don't know how to explain it.

531
01:01:14,103 --> 01:01:16,264
Oh.

532
01:01:34,157 --> 01:01:37,149
That's your Japanese friend, right?

533
01:01:43,299 --> 01:01:44,960
I can explain to you in more detail

534
01:01:45,201 --> 01:01:47,726
by showing you my slides.

535
01:01:48,104 --> 01:01:51,369
If you're still in Taiwan on Saturday...

536
01:01:51,641 --> 01:01:53,131
I will be.

537
01:01:53,376 --> 01:01:55,003
My flight is on Sunday.

538
01:01:55,244 --> 01:01:57,144
So it should be OK.

539
01:01:57,380 --> 01:01:59,644
He speaks Chinese.

540
01:02:04,587 --> 01:02:08,683
This is my info on Cold Food Observance,

541
01:02:11,327 --> 01:02:14,160
if it helps.

542
01:02:15,331 --> 01:02:16,298
Thank you.

543
01:02:16,599 --> 01:02:17,861
No problem.

544
01:02:18,868 --> 01:02:23,771
I can give a more complete introduction to
Cold Food Observance,

545
01:02:23,973 --> 01:02:26,635
background information and such.

546
01:02:26,876 --> 01:02:28,844
Thank you.

547
01:02:31,114 --> 01:02:34,015
Will your friend come with you?

548
01:02:34,250 --> 01:02:35,182
No,

549
01:02:35,418 --> 01:02:37,579
because I have to write tonight.

550
01:02:37,754 --> 01:02:39,881
I have things to write.

551
01:02:40,123 --> 01:02:42,353
So I can't make it.

552
01:02:45,862 --> 01:02:48,763
It's up to you.

553
01:02:49,665 --> 01:02:53,601
Anyways, you could suddenly turn this cold
again anytime.

554
01:02:54,637 --> 01:02:57,470
Nobody can stop you.

555
01:03:32,008 --> 01:03:33,737
Look! Look!

556
01:03:35,244 --> 01:03:38,338
The water is flowing so fast!

557
01:03:40,516 --> 01:03:41,278
Yeah!

558
01:03:41,384 --> 01:03:43,477
There's such a loud echo!

559
01:04:16,819 --> 01:04:17,376
Boss!

560
01:04:17,620 --> 01:04:18,279
Two more cans of beer.

561
01:04:18,554 --> 01:04:20,112
Help yourself.

562
01:04:20,489 --> 01:04:21,046
And...

563
01:04:21,390 --> 01:04:22,049
vegetable-egg.

564
01:04:22,258 --> 01:04:23,122
Vegetable-egg.

565
01:04:23,226 --> 01:04:24,250
One vegetable-egg.

566
01:04:24,327 --> 01:04:25,658
Yes.

567
01:04:26,162 --> 01:04:28,153
And a tofu dish.

568
01:04:28,431 --> 01:04:29,295
OK, then A-cai Tofu.

569
01:04:29,398 --> 01:04:30,626
OK.

570
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:31,523
Is that it?

571
01:04:31,734 --> 01:04:32,257
That's enough.

572
01:04:32,435 --> 01:04:33,060
Thank you.

573
01:04:33,402 --> 01:04:34,426
Thank you.

574
01:04:34,670 --> 01:04:35,898
You're welcome.

575
01:04:40,476 --> 01:04:41,204
Cheers.

576
01:04:41,544 --> 01:04:42,738
Cheers.

577
01:04:43,112 --> 01:04:45,637
Cheers!

578
01:04:53,256 --> 01:04:54,154
That's good.

579
01:04:54,457 --> 01:04:56,482
That is good.

580
01:05:45,074 --> 01:05:47,372
Cheers!

581
01:06:01,424 --> 01:06:05,690
I spent a year in Beijing before.

582
01:06:05,962 --> 01:06:09,090
That's where I learned Chinese.

583
01:06:09,432 --> 01:06:10,057
A year.

584
01:06:10,199 --> 01:06:11,097
That's impressive!

585
01:06:11,300 --> 01:06:12,927
You speak really well!

586
01:06:14,170 --> 01:06:17,537
This is my third time to Taiwan.

587
01:06:18,107 --> 01:06:23,943
Before I checked cars for my work.

588
01:06:25,481 --> 01:06:31,386
But now, I've truly gained something,

589
01:06:32,788 --> 01:06:34,813
due to the National Palace Museum.

590
01:06:35,057 --> 01:06:36,456
Yeah.

591
01:06:38,194 --> 01:06:43,655
Though I've yet to see
Cold Food Observance,

592
01:06:44,633 --> 01:06:48,626
I've seen see many other works of art.

593
01:06:49,672 --> 01:06:54,837
All have a common... personality.

594
01:06:56,445 --> 01:06:59,107
It's like my mood right now.

595
01:07:01,250 --> 01:07:03,548
How do you feel?

596
01:07:04,387 --> 01:07:06,855
Well...

597
01:07:08,991 --> 01:07:15,226
I feel..."quiet."

598
01:07:17,566 --> 01:07:21,764
Like your name, "Ching."

599
01:07:26,575 --> 01:07:30,739
Are you looking for "quiet" now?

600
01:07:34,650 --> 01:07:36,618
Yeah.

601
01:07:41,957 --> 01:07:47,554
Before I came, I didn't know what I wanted.

602
01:07:48,831 --> 01:07:55,600
Before in Taiwan, it was making money
and drinking beer.

603
01:07:57,640 --> 01:07:59,972
Busy during the day checking cars,

604
01:08:00,209 --> 01:08:04,305
busy at night singing and drinking.

605
01:08:04,847 --> 01:08:07,680
But this time,

606
01:08:08,317 --> 01:08:12,754
because of internal politics

607
01:08:12,988 --> 01:08:16,651
in my company in Japan,

608
01:08:18,394 --> 01:08:20,521
I was demoted.

609
01:08:23,432 --> 01:08:25,923
So for a lot of reasons,

610
01:08:26,168 --> 01:08:31,265
I wanted to find peace and quiet.

611
01:08:32,975 --> 01:08:36,843
Only then can I find myself.

612
01:08:46,789 --> 01:08:51,749
So now you feel like

613
01:08:51,927 --> 01:08:58,162
Su Shih when he was exiled, right?

614
01:08:59,001 --> 01:09:02,061
That's why you came to see
Cold Food Observance.

615
01:09:05,441 --> 01:09:07,739
You're half right.

616
01:09:09,345 --> 01:09:16,148
The other reason is very personal.

617
01:11:15,104 --> 01:11:16,469
This.

618
01:11:17,373 --> 01:11:19,534
No.

619
01:11:19,808 --> 01:11:21,867
Juice.

620
01:11:22,478 --> 01:11:23,035
This.

621
01:11:23,178 --> 01:11:26,375
Don't drink anymore.

622
01:11:26,782 --> 01:11:28,750
Juice.

623
01:11:35,791 --> 01:11:37,281
Just a sip.

624
01:11:37,593 --> 01:11:39,356
No.

625
01:11:39,662 --> 01:11:41,152
This.

626
01:11:45,734 --> 01:11:49,101
Your heart's broken.

627
01:11:55,611 --> 01:11:56,703
OK.

628
01:11:57,012 --> 01:11:58,240
Let's go.

629
01:11:58,647 --> 01:12:01,775
I'll get a taxi for you.

630
01:12:24,173 --> 01:12:26,607
If you knew kung-fu,

631
01:12:27,609 --> 01:12:28,598
I'd take you

632
01:12:31,580 --> 01:12:34,242
to the Museum

633
01:12:35,784 --> 01:12:38,275
to see Cold Food Observance.

634
01:12:42,057 --> 01:12:43,684
Thank you.

635
01:14:19,121 --> 01:14:21,021
The big author.

636
01:14:23,559 --> 01:14:26,221
Every day sitting at home.

637
01:14:41,510 --> 01:14:43,978
Another letter.

638
01:14:45,314 --> 01:14:54,780
I'm the mail lady with Big Author's letters.

639
01:15:00,796 --> 01:15:04,425
Have a good time drinking
with your handsome Japanese friend?

640
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:08,026
I had a really good time!

641
01:15:08,303 --> 01:15:09,065
Really.

642
01:15:09,171 --> 01:15:11,537
A really good time.

643
01:15:14,743 --> 01:15:17,541
I think he likes Su Shih better.

644
01:15:17,779 --> 01:15:20,543
Or why would you be here?

645
01:15:39,334 --> 01:15:41,165
Hey!

646
01:15:41,870 --> 01:15:44,361
Are you going to sleep here tonight?

647
01:15:48,944 --> 01:15:50,639
Hey!

648
01:15:59,988 --> 01:16:01,250
Up to you.

649
01:16:02,057 --> 01:16:05,185
Anyway, you pretty much pay the rent.

650
01:16:10,165 --> 01:16:11,564
Go to hell.

651
01:16:13,735 --> 01:16:15,965
What did you say?

652
01:16:19,274 --> 01:16:21,139
What did you say?

653
01:16:23,145 --> 01:16:25,238
What did you say?

654
01:16:34,723 --> 01:16:37,283
You never do anything.

655
01:16:42,064 --> 01:16:44,726
You're not old, but your heart is.

656
01:16:53,609 --> 01:16:56,544
The art history you studied was wrong.

657
01:17:00,916 --> 01:17:03,009
So narrow-minded.

658
01:17:07,222 --> 01:17:09,952
You're getting farther away from art!

659
01:17:18,700 --> 01:17:21,999
You're like those workers
tearing down the house.

660
01:17:23,672 --> 01:17:26,106
Just tearing down.

661
01:17:27,609 --> 01:17:31,045
Tear it down... Tear it down!

662
01:17:38,854 --> 01:17:41,379
You just sit at your computer!

663
01:17:43,091 --> 01:17:45,525
That's all you know!

664
01:17:46,828 --> 01:17:49,490
No wonder she can't stand you!

665
01:17:51,266 --> 01:17:53,791
All you know is computers!

666
01:17:56,304 --> 01:17:58,704
Who could stand that?

667
01:22:56,504 --> 01:22:58,768
Having some things imperfect

668
01:22:59,007 --> 01:23:01,703
is a necessary process.

669
01:23:02,110 --> 01:23:04,340
Just let it be this way.

670
01:23:05,747 --> 01:23:07,806
Please return these letters to her.

671
01:23:08,049 --> 01:23:09,744
Thank you.

672
01:23:13,121 --> 01:23:14,816
He told me,

673
01:23:15,056 --> 01:23:16,387
regrets in life

674
01:23:16,624 --> 01:23:17,613
are nothing more than

675
01:23:17,859 --> 01:23:20,157
memories at your leisure.

676
01:23:21,162 --> 01:23:24,097
If you have time, go see him.

677
01:23:35,310 --> 01:23:37,574
Look.

678
01:23:38,713 --> 01:23:41,841
It got knocked over that night.

679
01:23:42,517 --> 01:23:44,678
It broke.

680
01:24:06,441 --> 01:24:09,808
In 1945

681
01:24:10,045 --> 01:24:14,141
I had 2 pieces of worn-out clothes
in my bags,

682
01:24:14,382 --> 01:24:19,149
and a small jade horse my mother gave me.

683
01:24:21,389 --> 01:24:24,187
These two heirlooms

684
01:24:25,126 --> 01:24:30,792
accompanied me throughout the war.

685
01:24:33,134 --> 01:24:38,071
That is, until one night in 1975,

686
01:24:38,406 --> 01:24:42,240
during a typhoon in Taiwan.

687
01:25:04,833 --> 01:25:09,099
Though just an average piece of jade,

688
01:25:09,571 --> 01:25:11,903
to me

689
01:25:12,674 --> 01:25:17,270
it felt the same as if

690
01:25:17,479 --> 01:25:20,380
a relic at the museum had broken.

691
01:25:54,616 --> 01:25:57,949
In 1082, Su Shi

692
01:25:58,186 --> 01:26:01,644
offended the Emperor with his writing,

693
01:26:01,789 --> 01:26:04,815
and was banished to distant Huangzhou.

694
01:26:05,560 --> 01:26:10,429
He wrote this piece then
in that frame of mind.

695
01:26:16,137 --> 01:26:18,605
Here

696
01:26:18,907 --> 01:26:25,278
his poetry is filled with anguish.

697
01:26:30,718 --> 01:26:32,879
But look.

698
01:26:34,889 --> 01:26:37,551
His calligraphy

699
01:26:39,027 --> 01:26:45,227
conveys innocence and simplicity.

700
01:26:48,102 --> 01:26:50,002
I think

701
01:26:50,238 --> 01:26:53,730
This is a banished poet

702
01:26:54,209 --> 01:26:57,337
without any more cares.

703
01:26:59,714 --> 01:27:02,842
The fate of this work actually

704
01:27:04,085 --> 01:27:08,317
is the same as that of Su Shih.

705
01:27:08,756 --> 01:27:11,782
Destitute. Homeless.

706
01:27:18,533 --> 01:27:22,230
When English and French armies
attacked the Ch'ing court,

707
01:27:22,604 --> 01:27:25,164
the piece survived the flames.

708
01:27:25,406 --> 01:27:27,636
Then it went to Japan,

709
01:27:27,875 --> 01:27:31,072
and survived the Kanto earthquake.

710
01:27:31,312 --> 01:27:36,375
Most of Tokyo went up in flames.

711
01:27:38,720 --> 01:27:46,320
But Cold Food Observance was saved
when buried in rubble.

712
01:28:22,063 --> 01:28:30,937
My grandfather restored it in Japan.

713
01:28:40,315 --> 01:28:46,185
When I was very young,

714
01:28:46,254 --> 01:28:51,556
my grandfather told me the story of
Su Shih and Cold Food Observance.

715
01:28:55,129 --> 01:28:59,156
I think my grandfather,

716
01:28:59,567 --> 01:29:04,800
at heart, took this work as his own.

717
01:29:07,575 --> 01:29:10,310
He said he spent an entire year

718
01:29:10,345 --> 01:29:13,906
conversing with Cold Food Observance

719
01:29:14,349 --> 01:29:20,686
before he could see Su's feelings.

720
01:29:23,725 --> 01:29:28,458
I think as a restorer, he felt

721
01:29:28,596 --> 01:29:34,933
this was his greatest achievement.

722
01:29:36,371 --> 01:29:40,000
In the hospital,

723
01:29:41,242 --> 01:29:44,575
he took my hand and told me,

724
01:29:47,115 --> 01:29:50,209
that he wished he could go to Taiwan

725
01:29:50,251 --> 01:29:53,084
and see Cold Food Observance

726
01:29:54,756 --> 01:30:00,592
with his own eyes one more time.

727
01:30:03,398 --> 01:30:07,494
He could never forget it...

728
01:30:29,791 --> 01:30:31,782
I'm sorry.

729
01:30:34,996 --> 01:30:40,696
I'm entrusted with my grandfather's wish.

730
01:30:44,205 --> 01:30:51,134
I wanted to see the most

731
01:30:52,447 --> 01:30:58,477
beautiful work in my grandfather's heart.

732
01:31:05,626 --> 01:31:07,560
Thank you

733
01:31:10,598 --> 01:31:15,763
for letting me better understand him.

734
01:31:27,582 --> 01:31:29,413
Thank you.

735
01:32:38,886 --> 01:32:40,945
Thank you.

736
01:32:53,467 --> 01:32:55,867
I wrote a song

737
01:32:56,137 --> 01:32:58,469
for you.

738
01:33:20,428 --> 01:33:31,168
When you touch my shoulder

739
01:33:31,405 --> 01:33:38,368
I feel that

740
01:33:38,446 --> 01:33:47,548
I will see this sky again someday.

741
01:33:47,788 --> 01:33:56,127
Although you just brushed past,

742
01:33:56,297 --> 01:34:03,703
I believe this sky

743
01:34:04,038 --> 01:34:10,637
has already become a part of my heart.

744
01:34:10,745 --> 01:34:19,551
No matter how many seasons pass,

745
01:34:19,587 --> 01:34:28,825
it will never fade.

746
01:34:39,140 --> 01:34:40,937
Shima

747
01:34:43,511 --> 01:34:45,570
This character is for "person."

748
01:34:45,813 --> 01:34:48,646
It's my favorite ancient character.

749
01:34:53,354 --> 01:34:55,447
On tortoise shell inscriptions,

750
01:34:55,690 --> 01:35:01,026
the character represents a person
stretching out hands,

751
01:35:01,262 --> 01:35:04,254
wanting to interact with another person.

752
01:35:07,301 --> 01:35:12,364
This character displays friendship.

753
01:35:13,374 --> 01:35:15,501
Ching.

754
01:36:18,439 --> 01:36:23,741
Dad, come back and eat.

755
01:36:24,812 --> 01:36:27,542
I suddenly miss my father.

756
01:36:30,084 --> 01:36:32,951
He used to patrol the mountains.

757
01:36:33,587 --> 01:36:37,182
I loved going into the mountains
with him as a child.

758
01:36:44,098 --> 01:36:46,259
One day he left the house,

759
01:36:46,500 --> 01:36:48,968
heading off into the mountains.

760
01:36:51,438 --> 01:36:54,066
And he never came back.

761
01:37:07,021 --> 01:37:13,119
Afterwards,

762
01:37:13,360 --> 01:37:14,349
my family

763
01:37:14,595 --> 01:37:17,758
would go to the mountains every year,
shouting his name.

764
01:37:19,967 --> 01:37:23,027
As if he was lost,

765
01:37:23,671 --> 01:37:26,401
or did something wrong

766
01:37:26,640 --> 01:37:28,505
and was hiding like a child.

767
01:37:34,481 --> 01:37:41,250
Dad! Come back home for dinner!

768
01:37:59,039 --> 01:38:00,404
Remember!

769
01:38:00,641 --> 01:38:03,007
The space between solid and void

770
01:38:03,244 --> 01:38:06,338
must be continuous.

771
01:42:13,293 --> 01:42:21,564
A museum is here in the mountains.

772
01:42:22,236 --> 01:42:36,879
She just wanted passage by the island.

773
01:42:37,417 --> 01:42:39,385
But

774
01:42:39,553 --> 01:42:50,122
fate has made her stay.
