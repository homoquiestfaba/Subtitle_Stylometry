00:00:06,711 --> 00:00:08,545
<i>Good morning, New York!</i>

2
00:00:08,547 --> 00:00:10,647
<i>Chuck Barber here
with your sports update.</i>

3
00:00:10,649 --> 00:00:12,382
<i>Recapping last
night's action...</i>

4
00:00:12,384 --> 00:00:14,551
<i>The Yanks lost.
The Mets lost.</i>

5
00:00:14,553 --> 00:00:17,254
<i>The Knicks lost.
The Nets lost.</i>

6
00:00:17,256 --> 00:00:19,557
<i>In exhibition football...</i>

7
00:00:56,563 --> 00:00:58,898
<i>Oh, man.</i>

8
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:00,468
Only a sublet.

9
00:01:02,093 --> 00:01:03,670
Only a sublet.

10
00:01:08,410 --> 00:01:10,310
Fuck.

11
00:01:35,737 --> 00:01:37,738
"Rare village charmer.

12
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:40,441
"Wood-burning 'firpoke'...

13
00:01:40,443 --> 00:01:42,577
fireplace. "

14
00:01:42,579 --> 00:01:44,912
It's probably a dump.

15
00:01:44,914 --> 00:01:47,615
If it's not a dump,
it's probably gone.

16
00:01:47,617 --> 00:01:50,585
If it's not gone,
there's a catch.

17
00:01:50,587 --> 00:01:52,421
Yhere's always a catch.

18
00:01:52,423 --> 00:01:56,558
<i># Oh, I used to ask
my mother #</i>

19
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:00,429
<i># Would i ever find
true love? #</i>

20
00:02:00,431 --> 00:02:02,264
<i># She would tell me</i>

21
00:02:02,266 --> 00:02:04,600
<i># True love

22
00:02:04,602 --> 00:02:07,903

23
00:02:07,905 --> 00:02:10,272
<i># Mm-hmm</i>

24
00:02:10,274 --> 00:02:13,442
<i># So I've traveled on</i>

25
00:02:13,444 --> 00:02:16,446
<i># Everyone I came upon</i>

26
00:02:16,448 --> 00:02:19,449

<i># That's what they would say</i>

30
00:02:27,792 --> 00:02:30,593
<i># So years have passed</i>

31
00:02:30,595 --> 00:02:34,397
<i># And I'm all alone,
no longer do I #</i>

32
00:02:34,399 --> 00:02:36,366
You mind watching this for me?

33
00:02:36,368 --> 00:02:38,402
<i># I just place my faith</i>

34
00:02:38,404 --> 00:02:40,571
<i># In five little words</i>

35
00:02:40,573 --> 00:02:43,574
<i># From way back in my past</i>

36
00:02:43,576 --> 00:02:45,424
<i># My mama said</i>

37
00:02:45,792 --> 00:02:50,810

38
00:02:51,584 --> 00:02:53,567

00:03:19,446 --> 00:03:24,917
<i># "Seek and you shall find"</i>

46
00:03:24,919 --> 00:03:27,586

<i># "Seek and you shall find"</i>

48
00:03:30,525 --> 00:03:32,925
Hello?

49
00:03:32,927 --> 00:03:36,462
<i># If it's love that

50
00:03:36,464 --> 00:03:38,431
<i># "Seek and you

51
00:03:38,433 --> 00:03:41,600
I'll take it.

52
00:03:41,602 --> 00:03:44,770
<i># It might be right
around the corner #</i>

53
00:03:44,772 --> 00:03:47,774

00:03:47,776 --> 00:03:50,777
<i>You must be
Mr. Lester.</i>

55
00:03:50,779 --> 00:03:53,480
It's perfect.
Sam.

56
00:03:53,482 --> 00:03:54,614
Hi, Sam.

57
00:03:54,616 --> 00:03:56,750
Um, you know, Sam...

58
00:03:56,752 --> 00:03:59,453
As I mentioned to you
on the phone,

59
00:03:59,455 --> 00:04:01,888
it's a very unusual situation.

60
00:04:01,890 --> 00:04:03,924
<i>Well, it's...</i>

61
00:04:03,926 --> 00:04:06,426
<i>It's just what
I'm looking for.</i>

62
00:04:08,896 --> 00:04:11,466
<i>Mr. McVeigh is
getting married,</i>

63
00:04:11,468 --> 00:04:14,469
but he'd like to keep this
place and the furniture.

64
00:04:18,474 --> 00:04:20,475
Tell me...
is the current tenant...

65
00:04:20,477 --> 00:04:22,610
<i>Oh, it's Brian McVeigh.</i>

66
00:04:22,612 --> 00:04:25,580
Is Brian color-blind?

67
00:04:41,564 --> 00:04:43,098
Excuse me, madam.
No, it's okay.

68
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:45,934
It's my sister over here.

69
00:04:45,936 --> 00:04:47,102
Hi, sweetheart.

70
00:04:47,104 --> 00:04:48,470
Hello.

71
00:04:48,472 --> 00:04:49,938
Your hair's lighter.

72
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:52,474
Oh, shut up.

73
00:04:54,944 --> 00:04:56,780
You look great.
Nice outfit.

74
00:04:56,782 --> 00:04:58,948
Oh, this?
Matinee day.

75
00:04:58,950 --> 00:05:00,483
Oh, my God.

76
00:05:00,485 --> 00:05:02,452
You saw a play.
I am shocked. No.

77
00:05:02,454 --> 00:05:03,787
No, I went shopping.
Oh.

78
00:05:03,789 --> 00:05:05,455
Bendel's is empty
on matinee day.

79
00:05:05,457 --> 00:05:06,556
Of course.

80
00:05:06,558 --> 00:05:08,191
How was work?

81
00:05:08,193 --> 00:05:09,459
What could be new?

82
00:05:09,461 --> 00:05:12,061
I came, I flossed, I polished.

83
00:05:13,130 --> 00:05:14,964
Okay.

84
00:05:14,966 --> 00:05:18,501
So, what's the big news?

85
00:05:18,503 --> 00:05:19,737
You're not pregnant.

86
00:05:21,606 --> 00:05:23,874
Lucy, I'm a married woman.

87
00:05:23,876 --> 00:05:25,443
You're not having an affair.

88
00:05:25,445 --> 00:05:26,944
Get real.

89
00:05:26,946 --> 00:05:28,946
Okay, you give up?
You give up.

90
00:05:28,948 --> 00:05:30,481
All right.

91
00:05:38,623 --> 00:05:40,458
"Rare village charmer"...

92
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:41,960
It's only two days a week,

93
00:05:41,962 --> 00:05:44,496
but it could be like my own
what-do-you-call-it in the city.

94
00:05:44,498 --> 00:05:45,797
<i>Pied-à -terre.
Yeah, whatever.</i>

95
00:05:45,799 --> 00:05:47,899
But... on tuesdays,
I... I... I could go to museums.

96
00:05:47,901 --> 00:05:50,502
And... and on thursdays...
for shopping.

97
00:05:50,504 --> 00:05:52,537
I could paint.
But...

98
00:05:52,539 --> 00:05:55,474
I could take an art class,
you know?

99
00:06:03,550 --> 00:06:07,787
<i>Mr. McVeigh would like
to offer you this place</i>

100
00:06:07,789 --> 00:06:09,255
<i>two days a week</i>

101
00:06:09,257 --> 00:06:12,492
<i>for $92 a month.</i>

102
00:06:12,494 --> 00:06:14,093
Sold.

103
00:06:14,095 --> 00:06:16,796
You mean you don't care that
it's just two days a week?

104
00:06:16,798 --> 00:06:19,632
Well, no. actually, it's all
I can afford right now.

105
00:06:19,634 --> 00:06:21,267
Oh.

106
00:06:21,269 --> 00:06:24,270
No, no, no. What I mean is...
I mean right now.

107
00:06:24,272 --> 00:06:27,273
I'm already renting a place...
with roommates...

108
00:06:27,275 --> 00:06:29,276
lots and lots of roommates.

109
00:06:29,278 --> 00:06:32,513
Oh, well, then I'm sure
you'll enjoy some privacy

110
00:06:32,515 --> 00:06:33,280
two nights a week.

111
00:06:33,282 --> 00:06:34,281
Right.

112
00:06:34,283 --> 00:06:35,816
Okay, now...

113
00:06:35,818 --> 00:06:38,252
<i>Brian keeps wednesdays
and fridays.</i>

114
00:06:38,254 --> 00:06:40,521
Tuesday nights and
thursday nights

115
00:06:40,523 --> 00:06:42,155
have already been claimed.

116
00:06:42,157 --> 00:06:43,290
So that leaves...

117
00:06:43,292 --> 00:06:45,626
Well, so I'll take monday

118
00:06:45,628 --> 00:06:47,594
and, um...

119
00:06:48,263 --> 00:06:51,799
Saturday, in case I, uh,
want to go on a...

120
00:06:51,801 --> 00:06:54,269
Well, not exactly a date,
but in case I...

121
00:06:54,271 --> 00:06:56,771
In case you get lucky?

122
00:07:04,847 --> 00:07:07,248
<i>Brian, it's rented.</i>

123
00:07:11,153 --> 00:07:13,321
Mrs. Winkler...

124
00:07:13,323 --> 00:07:16,158
I could kiss you.

125
00:07:18,696 --> 00:07:20,296
<i>I love this woman.</i>

126
00:07:23,667 --> 00:07:25,968
Okay, everybody,
I got an announcement.

127
00:07:25,970 --> 00:07:28,304
I know there's been a lot
of rumors going around

128
00:07:28,306 --> 00:07:31,907
that, uh, because of, uh...
because I'm...

129
00:07:31,909 --> 00:07:33,909
Because she owns you.

130
00:07:33,911 --> 00:07:37,146
Because of my betrothal,
I was going to give up...

131
00:07:37,148 --> 00:07:39,983
pleasure.
The lion's den.

132
00:07:39,985 --> 00:07:41,318
<i>No. No. No.</i>

133
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:46,923
<i>Where there's a rent-controlled
lease, there's always a way.</i>

134
00:07:46,925 --> 00:07:49,659
So... what's the deal?

135
00:07:49,661 --> 00:07:51,995
Well, two days a week...

136
00:07:51,997 --> 00:07:55,298
T.G.I.F. and
wednesday-night poker.

137
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:57,233
Aah! Gimme, gimme,
gimme, gimme, yeah!

138
00:07:57,235 --> 00:07:59,669
Ah!
Who commerced?

139
00:07:59,671 --> 00:08:01,005
A - a stewardess?

140
00:08:01,007 --> 00:08:02,306
I don't even know them.

141
00:08:02,308 --> 00:08:04,675
I had, uh, my secretary

142
00:08:04,677 --> 00:08:08,312
<i>set up an unequal three-way
time-sharing progression.</i>

143
00:08:08,314 --> 00:08:09,647
<i>Wiggy.
Wiggy-wiggy.</i>

144
00:08:09,649 --> 00:08:11,282
<i>Yeah, right.</i>

145
00:08:11,284 --> 00:08:13,651
<i>One's gonna paint...</i>

146
00:08:13,653 --> 00:08:15,820
<i>and Mrs. Winkler
says the other one</i>

147
00:08:15,822 --> 00:08:17,989
<i>is getting over
a - a broken heart.</i>

148
00:08:25,832 --> 00:08:27,666
Two years of my life.

149
00:08:27,668 --> 00:08:29,668
What a waste.

150
00:08:29,670 --> 00:08:32,304
I wonder how she's doing.

151
00:08:52,092 --> 00:08:54,827
Oh, a mirror...
That's a little self-absorbed.

152
00:08:54,829 --> 00:08:57,897
It's a reflection on our
narcissistic culture.

153
00:08:57,899 --> 00:08:59,265
<i>Yeah.</i>

154
00:08:59,267 --> 00:09:01,300
<i>Sam, maybe you shouldn't
have come tonight.</i>

155
00:09:01,302 --> 00:09:02,669
<i>I'm fine.</i>

156
00:09:08,375 --> 00:09:11,011
Adeeka, adeeka,
adeeka, adeeka.

157
00:09:11,013 --> 00:09:13,347
La-di-da, la-di-da,
la-di-da, da-di-da.

158
00:09:13,349 --> 00:09:16,350
My mother, my sister,
my mother, my sister.

159
00:09:16,352 --> 00:09:18,252
<i>What is she doing?</i>

160
00:09:18,254 --> 00:09:20,187
Aaah!

161
00:09:20,189 --> 00:09:21,722
Oh! No!

162
00:09:21,724 --> 00:09:23,190
<i>Oh!</i>

163
00:09:23,192 --> 00:09:25,859
Jesus Christ.
What is she doing?

164
00:09:25,861 --> 00:09:27,861
It's... it's an expression
of her frustration

165
00:09:27,863 --> 00:09:29,329
with the weight
of European history.

166
00:09:29,331 --> 00:09:31,198
Ah.
Shh!

167
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,802
<i>Ahh. Ahh.</i>

168
00:09:33,804 --> 00:09:35,170
Oh...

169
00:09:35,172 --> 00:09:37,839
Who's the little lobster?
Would you like some lobster?

170
00:09:44,848 --> 00:09:46,481
Uncle Sam.

171
00:09:46,483 --> 00:09:48,917
Would you dance with me, please?
Sam.

172
00:09:48,919 --> 00:09:52,153
What's that supposed to mean?
It's a symbol, Sam.

173
00:09:53,490 --> 00:09:55,023
Boys...

174
00:09:55,025 --> 00:09:56,225
Aaah!

175
00:09:59,363 --> 00:10:01,363
I thought it went over very well.

176
00:10:01,365 --> 00:10:06,035
Bertrand missed his,
uh, lightning cues, the fool.

177
00:10:06,037 --> 00:10:07,870
R - really?
I thought so.

178
00:10:07,872 --> 00:10:09,505
But I don't think anybody
there noticed.

179
00:10:09,507 --> 00:10:13,476
What does you know about art?

180
00:10:13,478 --> 00:10:16,345
You know, pastel, I worry about
you walking home alone...

181
00:10:16,347 --> 00:10:18,013
Sam!
In the neighborhood.

182
00:10:18,015 --> 00:10:20,484
I don't use a lecture now.

183
00:10:21,854 --> 00:10:23,220
All right.

184
00:10:25,491 --> 00:10:28,191
Oh, Sammy.

185
00:10:46,211 --> 00:10:48,212
<i>The old apartment.</i>

186
00:10:48,214 --> 00:10:50,882
Put the bag there.

187
00:10:53,887 --> 00:10:55,353
Ahh.

188
00:10:55,355 --> 00:10:56,854
Hmm.

189
00:10:59,491 --> 00:11:02,193
You put some new posters
of yourself up.

190
00:11:02,195 --> 00:11:05,430
<i>I didn't want, uh,
memories of us, uh,</i>

191
00:11:05,432 --> 00:11:08,867
<i>haunting me now that the place
is mine now, hmm?</i>

192
00:11:15,509 --> 00:11:16,975
Hmm?

193
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:20,879
Hey, um...

194
00:11:20,881 --> 00:11:23,048
You want me to...
run downstairs

195
00:11:23,050 --> 00:11:26,051
and pick up some food and...

196
00:11:26,053 --> 00:11:27,853
whip something up?

197
00:11:32,226 --> 00:11:33,893
No.

198
00:11:37,031 --> 00:11:39,365
When you cook for me,

199
00:11:39,367 --> 00:11:41,401
I fall in love again.

200
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:48,942
I cannot do this now, hmm?

201
00:11:50,044 --> 00:11:52,046
Mm.

202
00:11:52,048 --> 00:11:56,517
I have an appointment early
in the morning for the PBS TV.

203
00:11:56,519 --> 00:11:59,620
I show them tonight's tape.
Omelette?

204
00:11:59,622 --> 00:12:02,056
Sam, mnh-mnh.

205
00:12:02,058 --> 00:12:04,358
Someday when you're
a big restaurateur

206
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:06,894
and I am a star,
maybe for us it will work.

207
00:12:06,896 --> 00:12:08,529
But now...

208
00:12:08,531 --> 00:12:10,297
you must go.

209
00:12:15,372 --> 00:12:18,373
Don't make it any harder for us.

210
00:12:33,522 --> 00:12:35,323
Well...

211
00:12:36,893 --> 00:12:38,527
Guess I'll be going.

212
00:12:40,231 --> 00:12:42,398
Could you put out my cigarette?

213
00:12:43,534 --> 00:12:45,201
Sure.

214
00:12:46,403 --> 00:12:48,404
<i>Ciao, Sammy.</i>

215
00:13:07,058 --> 00:13:11,295
<i># Rockaby, baby,
on the treetop #</i>

216
00:13:11,297 --> 00:13:15,365
<i>Aah! # When the wind blows,
the cradle will rock #</i>

217
00:13:15,367 --> 00:13:19,236
<i>Come on, baby. # When the bough breaks,
the cradle will fall #</i>

218
00:13:19,238 --> 00:13:23,073
<i>Ooh! # And down will come baby,
cradle and all #</i>

219
00:13:23,075 --> 00:13:24,542
Yeah! Ooh!

220
00:13:24,544 --> 00:13:26,277
Yeah!

221
00:13:26,279 --> 00:13:30,114
<i>Ooh! ooh! ooh!
Ooooh! Oh!</i>

222
00:13:30,116 --> 00:13:33,418
Ooh, yeah.

223
00:13:59,412 --> 00:14:02,114
It's wake-up time, Brian.

224
00:14:09,255 --> 00:14:10,490
<i>Brian?</i>

225
00:14:17,431 --> 00:14:19,399
<i>This is 96.3...</i>

226
00:14:19,401 --> 00:14:20,500
Good morning.

227
00:14:20,502 --> 00:14:23,103
<i>Nozart in the morning.</i>

228
00:14:33,247 --> 00:14:36,017
I was having the best
dream about us.

229
00:14:37,252 --> 00:14:39,387
So was I.

230
00:14:39,389 --> 00:14:43,090
Oh, I dreamt that we
were old, Brian...

231
00:14:43,092 --> 00:14:46,260
and that we'd been
married for 50 years.

232
00:14:46,262 --> 00:14:49,263
And all our grandchildren
and our great-grandchildren

233
00:14:49,265 --> 00:14:51,732
were all gathered at Mommy's
in Nantucket

234
00:14:51,734 --> 00:14:54,068
for our anniversary.

235
00:14:56,105 --> 00:14:58,440
What was your dream about?

236
00:14:58,442 --> 00:14:59,641
Mine?

237
00:15:01,677 --> 00:15:04,446
Uh... like that.

238
00:15:04,448 --> 00:15:06,248
Same kind.

239
00:15:06,250 --> 00:15:09,251
Mr. Jonathan is coming over
wednesday after work,

240
00:15:09,253 --> 00:15:11,086
and he's gonna show us
some fabrics.

241
00:15:11,088 --> 00:15:12,387
We don't have to
decide right away.

242
00:15:12,389 --> 00:15:14,089
That's what we pay him for.

243
00:15:14,091 --> 00:15:16,258
Wednesday?

244
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:17,726
I thought I was
gonna see the guys.

245
00:15:17,728 --> 00:15:20,396
Well, you'll have to
change it, darling.

246
00:15:22,266 --> 00:15:24,434
No problem.

247
00:15:24,436 --> 00:15:28,104
Oh, besides, we have the ballet
wednesday nights.

248
00:15:28,106 --> 00:15:31,407
Oh, yeah, ballet.

249
00:15:31,409 --> 00:15:33,676
I keep forgetting that.

250
00:15:36,580 --> 00:15:39,282
Thank you. Good morning,
Mrs. Beehan.

251
00:15:39,284 --> 00:15:40,283
Mr. Beehan.

252
00:15:40,285 --> 00:15:41,417
What?
No.

253
00:15:41,419 --> 00:15:43,287
No, I'm Beehan, he's McVeigh,

254
00:15:43,289 --> 00:15:45,522
but just for a few more months.

255
00:15:50,095 --> 00:15:52,296
Ah, fuck.

256
00:15:55,733 --> 00:15:57,568
Excuse me.

257
00:16:00,271 --> 00:16:02,739
Rinse, Mr. Potesky.

258
00:16:06,413 --> 00:16:08,580
I said, "Rinse," not gargle,
Mr. Potesky.

259
00:16:08,582 --> 00:16:10,315
Rinse.

260
00:16:12,118 --> 00:16:13,284
Hmm.

261
00:16:13,286 --> 00:16:14,219
Yeah.

262
00:16:15,217 --> 00:16:16,330
Yeah.

263
00:16:19,292 --> 00:16:20,859
You may spit.

264
00:16:24,763 --> 00:16:27,432
Would you adjust
my headrest again

265
00:16:27,434 --> 00:16:29,735
on the left side here, 'cause...

266
00:16:29,737 --> 00:16:31,570
Do you like my shirt?
It's very nice.

267
00:16:31,572 --> 00:16:35,441
I just got it in London.
Would you... have...

268
00:16:35,443 --> 00:16:37,743
Would you like to go
to London sometime?

269
00:16:37,745 --> 00:16:40,746
I'm a married woman, Mr. Potesky.

270
00:16:40,748 --> 00:16:42,414
Happily?

271
00:16:42,416 --> 00:16:44,450
Dr. John.

272
00:16:44,452 --> 00:16:46,752
Dr. John...

273
00:16:46,754 --> 00:16:48,921
she won't go to London
with me, Doc.

274
00:16:48,923 --> 00:16:50,589
Have a lolly.
He's all yours.

275
00:16:50,591 --> 00:16:51,924
Thanks.

276
00:16:53,294 --> 00:16:54,928
Can I ask you something?

277
00:16:54,930 --> 00:16:57,297
When she works on me
with those rubber gloves,

278
00:16:57,299 --> 00:17:01,601
that's just a standard practice
now, isn't it?

279
00:17:01,603 --> 00:17:02,936
It's not...

280
00:17:02,938 --> 00:17:04,271
Open.

281
00:17:28,363 --> 00:17:29,931
<i>Ahh.</i>

282
00:17:29,933 --> 00:17:32,600
I know, I know... I'm late.
It's okay.

283
00:17:32,602 --> 00:17:35,469
There was a tie-up on the belt
parkway you wouldn't believe.

284
00:17:35,471 --> 00:17:37,438
Oh, Aaron, it's not like the
tuna's gonna get cold.

285
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:39,441
All right, the truth...

286
00:17:39,443 --> 00:17:41,610
<i>I was at Marty's
watching the islanders,</i>

287
00:17:41,612 --> 00:17:43,245
<i>overtime.</i>

288
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:45,614
Look, I was with...
Pass the ketchup.

289
00:17:45,616 --> 00:17:47,316
Oh, thanks.
Yeah.

290
00:17:47,318 --> 00:17:48,951
Anyway, uh...

291
00:17:48,953 --> 00:17:50,953
I was with Lucy, and she wanted...
That's good-looking tuna.

292
00:17:50,955 --> 00:17:53,455
I lied.

293
00:17:53,457 --> 00:17:56,725
There was no overtime.

294
00:17:56,727 --> 00:17:59,461
No one's making a federal
case out of it.

295
00:17:59,463 --> 00:18:01,965
I've got a surprise.

296
00:18:01,967 --> 00:18:03,800
We're moving.

297
00:18:03,802 --> 00:18:06,936
<i>What?
To where?</i>

298
00:18:06,938 --> 00:18:11,708
To our new ranch-style
modern colonial

299
00:18:11,710 --> 00:18:16,312
<i>with wrap deck
and hallway atrium.</i>

300
00:18:16,314 --> 00:18:17,647
What?

301
00:18:17,649 --> 00:18:18,781
<i>You're joking.</i>

302
00:18:18,783 --> 00:18:20,950
No. I just went out and did it.

303
00:18:20,952 --> 00:18:22,652
Marty talked me into it.

304
00:18:22,654 --> 00:18:25,322
<i>Exit 52 on the L.I.E.</i>

305
00:18:25,324 --> 00:18:28,559
<i>Sparrow's nest
development.</i>

306
00:18:38,470 --> 00:18:39,703
Oh.

307
00:18:44,610 --> 00:18:46,377
I got it.

308
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:03,962
Secret garret...

309
00:19:03,964 --> 00:19:06,331
rediscovers a horizon

310
00:19:06,333 --> 00:19:09,501
of color...

311
00:19:09,503 --> 00:19:10,903
and form.

312
00:19:18,445 --> 00:19:21,380
<i>And I'll take half a
pound of French Chevret.</i>

313
00:19:21,382 --> 00:19:22,515
Want to try domestic?

314
00:19:22,517 --> 00:19:23,783
What's the difference?

315
00:19:23,785 --> 00:19:25,851
About $4 a pound.

316
00:19:28,622 --> 00:19:31,457
Otherwise, the French
is a little more status.

317
00:19:31,459 --> 00:19:34,594
The domestic is... it's fresher.
It's milkier.

318
00:19:34,596 --> 00:19:37,030
We have some very good...
I'll take the French.

319
00:19:37,032 --> 00:19:38,465
French.

320
00:19:42,337 --> 00:19:43,570
Thank you.

321
00:19:43,572 --> 00:19:45,505
Heathens.

322
00:19:45,507 --> 00:19:48,809
<i>Sam, pick up line 2.
Line 2, Sam. Excuse me.</i>

323
00:19:48,811 --> 00:19:50,477
Excuse me.

324
00:19:50,479 --> 00:19:52,218
Got to buy French cheese.

325
00:19:52,691 --> 00:19:54,397
Got to buy French cheese.

326
00:19:54,817 --> 00:19:56,483
Hello?
Good morning.

327
00:19:56,485 --> 00:19:59,854
<i>This is Mrs. Winkler
calling for Brian McVeigh...</i>

328
00:19:59,856 --> 00:20:02,957
Uh, who's had an unavoidable
change of scheduling

329
00:20:02,959 --> 00:20:04,959
and was wondering
if you wouldn't mind

330
00:20:04,961 --> 00:20:08,463
switching your monday night
for his wednesday.

331
00:20:08,465 --> 00:20:10,631
<i>Just wednesday?
Mm-hmm.</i>

332
00:20:10,633 --> 00:20:12,633
Uh, sure.
Wednesday is fine.

333
00:20:12,635 --> 00:20:14,435
<i>Oh, good.
Then it's settled.</i>

334
00:20:14,437 --> 00:20:18,406
Now, it'll be Brian on monday
and Sam wednesday.

335
00:20:18,408 --> 00:20:20,976
<i>Oh, should I send you
another chart?</i>

336
00:20:20,978 --> 00:20:22,711
No. don't be silly, Mrs. Winkler.

337
00:20:22,713 --> 00:20:24,513
<i>Bye.</i>

338
00:20:24,515 --> 00:20:25,714
Oh, yes!
Yes!

339
00:20:25,716 --> 00:20:28,650
<i>Excuse me.
Uh, excuse me.</i>

340
00:20:28,652 --> 00:20:32,588
half a pound of
St. André triple crème, please.

341
00:20:35,825 --> 00:20:37,180
Triple crème.

342
00:20:38,302 --> 00:20:39,704
Triple crème.

343
00:20:40,464 --> 00:20:42,097
That is heart-attack cheese.

344
00:20:43,702 --> 00:20:46,469
just take a knife to your
heart and stab it.

345
00:20:46,471 --> 00:20:49,506
It's, uh... a little over.

346
00:20:49,508 --> 00:20:50,974
Stupid French.
Sam.

347
00:20:50,976 --> 00:20:52,642
Smoke cigarettes.
Come on, Sam.

348
00:20:52,644 --> 00:20:54,144
Eat fat cheese.

349
00:20:54,146 --> 00:20:57,580
It doesn't hurt them.
Nothing hurts them.

350
00:20:58,449 --> 00:21:01,050
But no charge.

351
00:21:01,052 --> 00:21:03,653
Sam, this isn't about cheese.

352
00:21:06,993 --> 00:21:10,161
It's not about cheese,
It's too bad?

353
00:21:10,163 --> 00:21:12,663
<i>Faux pas.
Pity, sadness.</i>

354
00:21:12,665 --> 00:21:14,498
What are you...
Camus?

355
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:17,168
Is Pastel seeing someone, Sam?

356
00:21:17,170 --> 00:21:18,669
No.

357
00:21:18,671 --> 00:21:20,538
Yes.

358
00:21:20,540 --> 00:21:21,505
Maybe.

359
00:21:21,507 --> 00:21:22,807
I don't know.

360
00:21:22,809 --> 00:21:24,809
I'm sorry.

361
00:21:24,811 --> 00:21:27,478
Big deal.
What's the difference?

362
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:29,146
Why? What makes
you think that she is?

363
00:21:29,148 --> 00:21:31,516
Well, an artist needs...

364
00:21:31,518 --> 00:21:34,486
Needs to experience things.
What does that mean?

365
00:21:34,488 --> 00:21:36,822
I suppose that I'm
sexually paranoid?

366
00:21:36,824 --> 00:21:38,990
No, it's too late.
You're way past that.

367
00:21:38,992 --> 00:21:41,827
You're on the verge
of the psychotic.

368
00:21:41,829 --> 00:21:43,562
What's her problem, then?

369
00:21:43,564 --> 00:21:46,531
No matter what I want from her,
she can't give it to me.

370
00:21:46,533 --> 00:21:50,168
What is her problem that no matter what
I want from her, she can't give it to me.

371
00:21:50,170 --> 00:21:52,538
<i>What is her problem that no matter what
I want from her... Sam, instead of asking</i>

372
00:21:52,540 --> 00:21:57,677
<i>maybe it would be better to ask,
"What is my problem...</i>

373
00:21:57,679 --> 00:22:02,248
that I am trying to get something from
someone who can't give it to me?"

374
00:22:04,818 --> 00:22:06,519
What's your point?

375
00:22:06,521 --> 00:22:07,854
My point is...

376
00:22:09,490 --> 00:22:12,825
I've got a girl I want you
to meet, to date.

377
00:22:12,827 --> 00:22:15,529
Oh, no.
No, I can't.

378
00:22:15,531 --> 00:22:16,663
I couldn't.

379
00:22:16,665 --> 00:22:19,600
You can, Sam.
You should.

380
00:22:38,855 --> 00:22:40,922
<i>It's Catha.
Come in.</i>

381
00:22:42,558 --> 00:22:44,559
I know.

382
00:22:44,561 --> 00:22:48,162
I know I have been in
this building before.

383
00:22:48,164 --> 00:22:51,165
It is the weirdest thing,
but I know.

384
00:22:51,167 --> 00:22:53,835
I know. yes.

385
00:22:53,837 --> 00:22:56,304
Yes. Yes.

386
00:22:56,306 --> 00:22:58,172
Well, maybe you were.

387
00:22:58,174 --> 00:22:59,574
I'm Sam.

388
00:22:59,576 --> 00:23:02,545
But I wasn't, don't you see?
I wasn't...

389
00:23:02,547 --> 00:23:04,313
Not in this life.

390
00:23:04,315 --> 00:23:07,683
But there's an aura I...

391
00:23:09,287 --> 00:23:11,020
I know.
I know, kooky, right?

392
00:23:11,022 --> 00:23:12,555
No, no.
N - not at all.

393
00:23:12,557 --> 00:23:14,990
<i>My chiropractor, Tom...
he's wonderful.</i>

394
00:23:14,992 --> 00:23:16,191
<i>He's just amazing.</i>

395
00:23:16,193 --> 00:23:20,195
And he says that maybe
it's my alignment.

396
00:23:20,197 --> 00:23:21,697
<i>Is that veal?</i>

397
00:23:21,699 --> 00:23:23,198
Not just any veal.

398
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:24,801
<i>I don't eat veal.</i>

399
00:23:24,803 --> 00:23:27,203
I... I don't eat meat, but
I especially do not eat veal.

400
00:23:27,205 --> 00:23:29,239
Do you know how they treat
veal when it's young?

401
00:23:29,241 --> 00:23:31,841
Well, actually,
veal isn't an animal.

402
00:23:31,843 --> 00:23:34,644
They pen it up. Lillian says that it's...
Who's Lillian?

403
00:23:34,646 --> 00:23:39,396
Lillian, my nutritionalist, she says
that it's antibiotics and steroids...

404
00:23:39,790 --> 00:23:41,801
All right, well,
we don't have to eat it.

405
00:23:42,187 --> 00:23:43,587
All right.

406
00:24:03,709 --> 00:24:06,210
I could make an omelette.

407
00:24:06,212 --> 00:24:10,348
Eggs, uh, don't combine at all.

408
00:24:10,350 --> 00:24:13,318
No, they don't, do they?

409
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:15,320
I combine now.

410
00:24:15,322 --> 00:24:18,190
Besides, I'm...
I'm lacto-ovo.

411
00:24:18,192 --> 00:24:22,361
Well, so was my sister,
except for Chinese food.

412
00:24:24,030 --> 00:24:26,164
Right.
Okay.

413
00:24:26,166 --> 00:24:27,866
Uh...

414
00:24:27,868 --> 00:24:31,336
Kenneth tells me that you two
went to art school together.

415
00:24:31,338 --> 00:24:35,041
Oh, yes.
Um, a lifetime ago.

416
00:24:38,345 --> 00:24:40,046
Wine?

417
00:24:40,048 --> 00:24:43,383
No.
Alcohol...

418
00:24:43,385 --> 00:24:45,385
Doesn't combine, does it?

419
00:24:45,387 --> 00:24:48,021
It... it breeds yeast.

Nah. Official.
What?

Wiggy, wiggy, wiggy.

on the field

487
00:31:08,753 --> 00:31:12,221

well, let's just take a look down there

488

<i>and see what's going on.</i>

489
00:31:14,125 --> 00:31:17,193

have decided</i>

00:31:17,195 --> 00:31:19,762

Where's it raining?</i>

494
00:31:28,773 --> 00:31:32,142
<i>You know, driving over here...
Huh? Tell me!</i>

495
00:31:32,144 --> 00:31:34,144

00:31:48,626 --> 00:31:51,295
Would you put it out?

502
00:31:55,134 --> 00:31:57,702
There's a cappuccino place...

503
00:31:59,305 --> 00:32:02,307
He is such a jerk.

504
00:32:02,309 --> 00:32:05,443
Look at this.
I sewed these by hand.

505
00:32:05,445 --> 00:32:08,313
Then you deserve what you get.

506
00:32:08,315 --> 00:32:10,315
Oh, God.
These are good.

507
00:32:10,317 --> 00:32:12,784
So what if he used your
curtains to drain them?

508
00:32:12,786 --> 00:32:14,486
No. That's the...

509
00:32:14,488 --> 00:32:17,623
This is the other guy.
This is t-the bad man.

510
00:32:17,625 --> 00:32:19,625
Those are from the good man.

511
00:32:19,627 --> 00:32:20,893
Mmm.

512
00:32:20,895 --> 00:32:23,162
You really should meet him
one of these days.

513
00:32:23,164 --> 00:32:26,632
Oh, that's it.
God damn it.

514
00:32:31,738 --> 00:32:33,339
Has he no shame?

515
00:32:35,308 --> 00:32:36,442
No.

516
00:32:36,444 --> 00:32:38,310
Come on, just try.

517
00:32:38,312 --> 00:32:42,149
I don't have to do anything
or be anything. Come on.

518
00:32:42,151 --> 00:32:44,384
I don't have to do anything
or be anything.

519
00:32:44,386 --> 00:32:45,785
Okay?
Good.

520
00:32:45,787 --> 00:32:47,320
And...

521
00:32:47,322 --> 00:32:51,791

529
00:33:06,476 --> 00:33:10,178

530
00:33:10,180 --> 00:33:12,647

You're Ellen from the apartment?

531

what I did to the plant?

533
00:33:16,386 --> 00:33:17,885
I thought that you'd be happy.

534
00:33:17,887 --> 00:33:19,787
Happy?
You thought I'd be happy?

535
00:33:19,789 --> 00:33:22,557
This is unbelievable. You thought
I'd be happy? You know what?

536
00:33:22,559 --> 00:33:24,959
<i>You're out of your
fucking macho mind!</i>

537
00:33:35,338 --> 00:33:36,972
Mnh-mnh-mnh.
Tsk, tsk, tsk.

538
00:33:36,974 --> 00:33:39,441
Next.

539
00:33:52,923 --> 00:33:54,591
Mrs. Winkler...

540
00:33:54,593 --> 00:33:57,327
could you send some flowers to
my tuesday and thursday woman

541
00:33:57,329 --> 00:33:58,494
<i>at the lion's den?</i>

542
00:33:58,496 --> 00:34:00,630
<i>She, uh, sent me
a nice note.</i>

543
00:34:01,799 --> 00:34:04,968
<i>"Mi casa es su casa.</i>

544
00:34:04,970 --> 00:34:08,771
Fondly, Brian. "

545
00:34:15,514 --> 00:34:17,648
Ellen, hi.
I bought you a little gift.

546
00:34:17,650 --> 00:34:19,650
Mr. Potesky, I thought
you just had x-rays.

547
00:34:19,652 --> 00:34:22,353
Huh? Oh, no,
but I moved last time.

548
00:34:22,355 --> 00:34:25,489
Maybe you should hold me down.
Hold you down?

549
00:34:25,491 --> 00:34:28,492
<i>Ellen, it's Aaron. He's getting
out of work early tonight.</i>

550
00:34:28,494 --> 00:34:32,997
Hi. I can't... I can't talk.
I have Mr. Potesky in the chair.

551
00:34:32,999 --> 00:34:34,565
Tonight?

552
00:34:40,640 --> 00:34:41,973
Oh, Christ.

553
00:34:44,478 --> 00:34:47,612
I don't even know
what she's doing.

554
00:34:47,614 --> 00:34:50,482
Isn't she supposed to be dead?

555
00:34:56,822 --> 00:34:58,691
Game's starting.

556
00:35:01,828 --> 00:35:04,530
Aaron, it's just two
more minutes.

557
00:35:04,532 --> 00:35:06,999
<i>Chuck Barber back with you
in the NCK Studios.</i>

558
00:35:07,001 --> 00:35:09,035
<i>If you're an islander fan,
you'll want to...</i>

559
00:35:09,037 --> 00:35:11,003
<i>Ellen, we're gonna miss
the 10:40.</i>

560
00:35:11,005 --> 00:35:13,372
<i>Who cares? Relax.
A foreign movie.</i>

561
00:35:13,374 --> 00:35:15,374
I don't read enough during the
day. I have to read subtitles?

562
00:35:15,376 --> 00:35:17,543
I have a surprise for you.
Just hold on one second. What is it?

563
00:35:17,545 --> 00:35:19,512
Okay, wait. Shh.
Close your eyes.

564
00:35:19,514 --> 00:35:22,649
Why?
Because I have a surprise for you.

565
00:35:22,651 --> 00:35:26,520
Oh, oh, come on, this is so stupid.
Come on. No, it's not.

566
00:35:26,522 --> 00:35:28,488
Come on.
Give me your hand.

567
00:35:28,490 --> 00:35:29,856
Subtitles.

568
00:35:32,827 --> 00:35:35,362
Ellen, what are you doing?

569
00:35:35,364 --> 00:35:38,665
I'm adding romance to our life.

570
00:35:38,667 --> 00:35:40,667
We're married.

571
00:35:40,669 --> 00:35:43,503
We're gonna have a nice,
little romantic evening in this place.

572
00:35:43,505 --> 00:35:45,606
Stay right there.
Okay.

573
00:35:47,509 --> 00:35:48,910
Music.

574
00:35:51,848 --> 00:35:53,548
Oh.

575
00:35:54,684 --> 00:35:56,684
Back.

576
00:36:14,538 --> 00:36:16,505
What is this?

577
00:36:16,507 --> 00:36:18,006
This is, um,

578
00:36:18,008 --> 00:36:20,542
you know Karen,
the receptionist at work...

579
00:36:20,544 --> 00:36:22,544
she gave it to us
for the evening.

580
00:36:22,546 --> 00:36:25,013
<i>It's like our own little
romantic pied-ã -terre</i>

581
00:36:25,015 --> 00:36:26,682
in the city.

582
00:36:28,018 --> 00:36:29,518
Ellen?
Yeah?

583
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:31,855
Ellen. Ellen.
Ellen. Ellen.

584
00:36:31,857 --> 00:36:34,023
This is a slum.

585
00:36:34,025 --> 00:36:36,393
I... I... it reminds me
of my grandmother's.

586
00:36:36,395 --> 00:36:38,528
There's no carpet.

587
00:36:38,530 --> 00:36:41,564
It's old.
I...

588
00:36:41,566 --> 00:36:42,999
Oh, look at these.

589
00:36:43,001 --> 00:36:45,835
Look at these paintings.

590
00:36:48,006 --> 00:36:50,507
I imagine what she paid for this place.
So it's a rental, right?

591
00:36:50,509 --> 00:36:53,543
She could probably own something
in flushing for less.

592
00:37:08,460 --> 00:37:10,528
<i>#... To dry my tears</i>

593
00:37:10,530 --> 00:37:13,864
<i># So what do I do with
the thought of you? #</i>

594
00:37:13,866 --> 00:37:17,035
<i># To forget you
is my greatest fear #</i>

595
00:37:17,037 --> 00:37:18,570
<i># I'd lose my...</i>

596
00:37:30,551 --> 00:37:33,552
<i>Oh, shit.
It's the fun cops.</i>

597
00:37:33,554 --> 00:37:35,520
Come on,
I got to go to work.

598
00:37:41,696 --> 00:37:45,465
I'm sorry, dude.
You know how it is.

599
00:37:48,870 --> 00:37:50,198
Oh, shit.

600
00:37:50,948 --> 00:37:52,267
Oh, shit.

601
00:37:52,707 --> 00:37:55,541
P - Pastel, what are you
doing here? Oh, Sam.

602
00:37:55,543 --> 00:37:58,711
What is it you're doing here?

603
00:37:58,713 --> 00:38:01,113
Oh.

604
00:38:06,020 --> 00:38:08,555
<i>Bark, bark, woof!</i>

605
00:38:17,699 --> 00:38:19,566
How can you eat that stuff?

606
00:38:19,568 --> 00:38:21,235
<i>Sam, don't start.
Fine.</i>

607
00:38:21,237 --> 00:38:23,537
<i>Hey, Pastel, bonjour.</i>

608
00:38:25,207 --> 00:38:26,608
You believe this?

609
00:38:26,610 --> 00:38:30,211
No, I didn't know Shep
was crashed with Sam.

610
00:38:30,213 --> 00:38:32,714
Who... who's Shep?
Hey, dude.

611
00:38:32,716 --> 00:38:36,217
I'm a friend of Leslie's.
I got here last night. Morning.

612
00:38:36,219 --> 00:38:39,554
Last night? You met him last night,
and already you're sleeping with him?

613
00:38:39,556 --> 00:38:41,723
So what?

614
00:38:42,892 --> 00:38:44,559
Get on my back already.

615
00:38:44,561 --> 00:38:47,061
I'm not your little girl
waiting to be rescued.

616
00:38:47,063 --> 00:38:49,030
Where did you guys meet?

617
00:38:49,032 --> 00:38:52,034
Mm, well, a meat market.

618
00:38:57,574 --> 00:38:59,308
Oh, Sam.

619
00:39:00,544 --> 00:39:03,546
I am sorry you cannot deal
with rejection.

620
00:39:03,548 --> 00:39:05,548
Oh, I'm being rejected.
I'm being rejected.

621
00:39:05,550 --> 00:39:06,715
That's a good one.
Mm-hmm.

622
00:39:06,717 --> 00:39:08,551
I'm not being rejected.

623
00:39:08,553 --> 00:39:10,586
I'm...

624
00:39:10,588 --> 00:39:13,156
I'm disappointed in you.

625
00:39:13,158 --> 00:39:15,592
Who's being rejected?
Sam. Good morning, Leslie.

626
00:39:15,594 --> 00:39:17,227
Hey, Shep.

627
00:39:17,229 --> 00:39:18,595
Hi, Les.

628
00:39:18,597 --> 00:39:21,565
Go ahead. Play water
sports with Tex here.

629
00:39:21,567 --> 00:39:23,567
That ought to liberate you
artistically.

630
00:39:23,569 --> 00:39:25,702
You're very hard on her.
Oh, you see?

631
00:39:25,704 --> 00:39:28,905
Oh, you see.
Oh, everyone sees.

632
00:39:28,907 --> 00:39:31,207
<i>You want me to be
something you want,</i>

633
00:39:31,209 --> 00:39:32,742
<i>not what I want!</i>

634
00:39:32,744 --> 00:39:36,047
<i>What you say you want to do,
not what you do do!</i>

635
00:39:36,049 --> 00:39:38,215
<i>No, I do do what I say I do!</i>

636
00:39:38,217 --> 00:39:40,585
<i>What I don't do
is what you say I do!</i>

637
00:39:40,587 --> 00:39:42,720
<i>I want to do.</i>

638
00:39:44,056 --> 00:39:46,612
I don't understand that.
Um, uh, uh, more coffee?

639
00:39:47,894 --> 00:39:50,361
I... no, I can't deal with this now.

640
00:39:50,363 --> 00:39:52,229
I can't deal with this now.

641
00:39:52,231 --> 00:39:55,232
Uh, I have a rehearsal at PBS
for my video.

642
00:39:55,234 --> 00:39:57,602
Not that you care even still.

643
00:39:57,604 --> 00:39:59,071
Why should I care about that?

644
00:39:59,073 --> 00:40:00,906
Oh, that's nice.
Typical male ego.

645
00:40:00,908 --> 00:40:02,240
No, you leave Sam alone!

646
00:40:02,242 --> 00:40:04,643
Oh, ho ho.

647
00:40:05,745 --> 00:40:08,246
Well, Sam...

648
00:40:08,248 --> 00:40:11,750
Will you tape it for me tonight
on your VCR?

649
00:40:12,719 --> 00:40:15,387
Huh?
Please?

650
00:40:15,389 --> 00:40:17,356
<i>Sammy.</i>

651
00:40:17,358 --> 00:40:18,991
<i>Hmm?</i>

652
00:40:18,993 --> 00:40:20,726
Excuse me.

653
00:40:20,728 --> 00:40:24,163
Do you have any really poor-quality,
low-grade videotape?

654
00:40:27,368 --> 00:40:30,236
That's it.
Now I know it's over.

655
00:40:30,238 --> 00:40:32,405
That was a tough morning, Sam.

656
00:40:32,407 --> 00:40:34,374
No, no, the music.

657
00:40:34,376 --> 00:40:37,910
You know you're really breaking
up when every last song you hear,

658
00:40:37,912 --> 00:40:41,280
no matter how stupid, suddenly
sounds incredibly poignant.

659
00:40:41,282 --> 00:40:43,416
<i>#... And I'm with you</i>

660
00:40:43,418 --> 00:40:45,319
This is the saddest song.

661
00:40:45,321 --> 00:40:51,258
<i># And all that I so want to
give you, babe #</i>

662
00:40:53,896 --> 00:40:55,229
Thank you very much.
Yep.

663
00:40:55,231 --> 00:40:57,064
Have a nice day.

664
00:40:57,066 --> 00:40:59,400
She had no way of knowing
you were living there, too.

665
00:40:59,402 --> 00:41:03,404
That's the thing.
It's almost like...

666
00:41:03,406 --> 00:41:06,407
like I was meant to see her,
so it would finally sink in.

667
00:41:06,409 --> 00:41:08,743
$4.50. no bag.
Save a tree.

668
00:41:08,745 --> 00:41:11,079
I mean, it can't be an accident

669
00:41:11,081 --> 00:41:13,915
that the guy she picked up
just got into New York

670
00:41:13,917 --> 00:41:16,384
and happens to be
crashing at the place

671
00:41:16,386 --> 00:41:18,920
that I happen to be subletting.

672
00:41:18,922 --> 00:41:20,088
You know?
Hello?

673
00:41:20,090 --> 00:41:21,923
Don't you think?

674
00:41:21,925 --> 00:41:25,760
I mean, there's got to be
a reason for it, right?

675
00:41:25,762 --> 00:41:28,396
Sam, there is no reason
for anything.

676
00:41:28,398 --> 00:41:30,265
Thank you.
Thank you.

677
00:41:30,267 --> 00:41:32,435
Remind me never to
invite you to a funeral.

678
00:41:32,437 --> 00:41:35,971
<i>Whatever happens, happens, Sam.
That's all I'm saying.</i>

679
00:41:37,074 --> 00:41:39,075
Pez?
Sure.

680
00:41:39,077 --> 00:41:41,377
Uh, nah.
Yeah.

681
00:41:41,379 --> 00:41:43,913
Ah. I can't make up my mind.

682
00:41:43,915 --> 00:41:46,882
But you need to have
a little fun in your life.

683
00:41:48,085 --> 00:41:49,752
Whatever happened to Catha?

684
00:41:49,754 --> 00:41:51,954
We didn't combine well.

685
00:41:53,256 --> 00:41:56,093
Well, why don't you ask Leslie out?

686
00:41:56,095 --> 00:41:57,928
Oh, come on.

687
00:41:57,930 --> 00:42:00,097
No, I... I'm not ready for
a relationship right now.

688
00:42:00,099 --> 00:42:01,765
I can't handle it.

689
00:42:01,767 --> 00:42:03,433
Well...
Can't even handle a plant.

690
00:42:03,435 --> 00:42:05,268
On the bright side,
no sex is safe sex.

691
00:42:05,270 --> 00:42:06,737
Yeah.

692
00:42:06,739 --> 00:42:10,440
You know what I'd like? You want
to know what I'd like right now?

693
00:42:10,442 --> 00:42:12,943
I'd like to meet a girl
from Norway...

694
00:42:12,945 --> 00:42:16,379
who speaks no English at all and is
only in this country for two weeks

695
00:42:16,381 --> 00:42:20,251
'cause she's gonna be flying
to Malaysia or Burma

696
00:42:20,253 --> 00:42:23,421
and gonna stay there
for about five years.

697
00:42:23,423 --> 00:42:25,089
That I can handle.

698
00:42:25,091 --> 00:42:26,390
Pardon me.

699
00:42:26,392 --> 00:42:29,827
Do you know if I am
Greenwich Village?

700
00:42:36,268 --> 00:42:38,002
There it is.
Over there.

701
00:42:43,910 --> 00:42:46,278
<i>Oh, I'm sorry.
It's over there.</i>

702
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:48,347
<i>It's over there.</i>

703
00:42:51,785 --> 00:42:53,418
Right here...

704
00:42:53,420 --> 00:42:56,188
Will be a two-story atrium.

705
00:42:57,423 --> 00:43:00,392
So when you walk in past
the landscaped lawn area,

706
00:43:00,394 --> 00:43:04,564
you'll get a feeling of vastness...

707
00:43:04,566 --> 00:43:07,300
Of openness, if you will.

708
00:43:07,302 --> 00:43:09,435
A chandelier above...

709
00:43:09,437 --> 00:43:12,071
<i>will light the way</i>

710
00:43:12,073 --> 00:43:13,406
toward...

711
00:43:18,979 --> 00:43:22,482
the colonial-style living room...

712
00:43:24,585 --> 00:43:29,323
with mock fieldstone fireplace.

713
00:43:29,325 --> 00:43:31,458
<i>Now, the bedrooms...</i>

714
00:43:31,460 --> 00:43:33,294
<i>Uh, you ordered, uh...</i>

715
00:43:33,296 --> 00:43:34,328
Four.

716
00:43:34,330 --> 00:43:37,031
<i>Two boys and a girl.</i>

717
00:43:45,574 --> 00:43:47,274
Aaron means well, you know,

718
00:43:47,276 --> 00:43:48,576
but it's just like the whole day

719
00:43:48,578 --> 00:43:50,579
I felt like I was in
another time zone.

720
00:43:50,581 --> 00:43:52,414
<i>Yeah, like 20 years.</i>

721
00:43:53,584 --> 00:43:55,450
Do you want to stay
here for a while?

722
00:43:55,452 --> 00:43:57,219
You're welcome to.

723
00:43:59,956 --> 00:44:03,425
I keep trying to tell him, but it's
like he just doesn't want to listen.

724
00:44:03,427 --> 00:44:05,460
Well, you've got
to do something.

725
00:44:05,462 --> 00:44:07,429
You can't move out there.

726
00:44:09,465 --> 00:44:12,234
I'm thinking of having an affair.

727
00:44:12,236 --> 00:44:14,003
You're kidding.

728
00:44:15,907 --> 00:44:17,406
You mean you're not upset?

729
00:44:17,408 --> 00:44:19,475
Just let me know if
you want me to lie

730
00:44:19,477 --> 00:44:22,011
or to cover or to stall... anything.

731
00:44:22,013 --> 00:44:25,114
It's gonna be weird, though...
sleeping with another man.

732
00:44:25,116 --> 00:44:27,116
God.
Can you imagine?

733
00:44:27,118 --> 00:44:30,119
Promise to tell me what it's like.
It's been so long.

734
00:44:30,121 --> 00:44:31,954
Yeah, like 29 years.

735
00:44:31,956 --> 00:44:34,156
Well, ellen, you're 29.
Yeah.

736
00:44:34,158 --> 00:44:36,226
So it can't have been 29 years.

737
00:44:36,228 --> 00:44:37,594
It can't?
Not unless...

738
00:44:37,596 --> 00:44:39,429
No.

739
00:44:39,431 --> 00:44:40,631
Don't tell me.

740
00:44:40,633 --> 00:44:42,633
What?
Oh, my God.

741
00:44:44,403 --> 00:44:47,037
What?!

742
00:44:47,039 --> 00:44:50,340
I'm sorry. It's just...
How can that be?

743
00:44:50,342 --> 00:44:53,043
I don't know.

744
00:44:59,485 --> 00:45:00,451
Talk to me.

745
00:45:00,453 --> 00:45:02,153
Do you sell caviar?

746
00:45:02,155 --> 00:45:04,289
I'm cheese.
Caviar's down there.

747
00:45:04,291 --> 00:45:05,423
They told me that you...

748
00:45:05,425 --> 00:45:06,958
you would know.

749
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:09,294
I'm kind of an institution
around here.

750
00:45:09,296 --> 00:45:12,130
Um, all right,
what's the occasion?

751
00:45:12,132 --> 00:45:16,467
Uh, well, one... it's a special
night with a special person.

752
00:45:16,469 --> 00:45:18,436
<i>And two...
I have champagne.</i>

753
00:45:18,438 --> 00:45:21,239
<i>And, uh, three...
what goes with it?</i>

754
00:45:21,241 --> 00:45:24,276
Four... anything but tuna.
Oh.

755
00:45:24,278 --> 00:45:26,478
<i>Excuse me.</i>

756
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:28,614
<i>All right,
so much for jokes.</i>

757
00:45:28,616 --> 00:45:31,483
No, it was funny.
It was just...

758
00:45:31,485 --> 00:45:35,454
Uh, how well does this special
person know his caviar?

759
00:45:35,456 --> 00:45:38,490
<i>Um, I'm not sure.</i>

760
00:45:38,492 --> 00:45:41,160
Well, how well do you know
this special person?

761
00:45:41,162 --> 00:45:44,596
Well, we... we, uh,
live together.

762
00:45:44,598 --> 00:45:47,100
Excuse me.
I'm double-parked.

763
00:45:47,102 --> 00:45:50,070
I have some, uh,
overpriced beluga.

764
00:45:50,072 --> 00:45:52,605
Oh, it's marvelous.
I had it last weekend.

765
00:45:52,607 --> 00:45:56,476
And I have some California.
It's trendy, but so-so.

766
00:45:56,478 --> 00:45:59,612
Or we just got a new shipment in
from China.

767
00:45:59,614 --> 00:46:02,449
I've tasted it, and it's fine,
really fine.

768
00:46:02,451 --> 00:46:05,986
Only thing is, nobody believes
that they make caviar in China,

769
00:46:05,988 --> 00:46:07,721
so it's about half the price.

770
00:46:09,491 --> 00:46:11,325
Mm.

771
00:46:11,327 --> 00:46:13,361
It's a really special evening.

772
00:46:13,363 --> 00:46:14,996
I know.

773
00:46:14,998 --> 00:46:17,498
You'll take the overpriced beluga.

774
00:46:17,500 --> 00:46:19,400
<i>No.</i>

775
00:46:19,402 --> 00:46:24,171
Um... just give me enough
for two people,

776
00:46:24,173 --> 00:46:26,040
and I think he eats a lot.

777
00:46:36,319 --> 00:46:38,487
She trusts me.
She trusts me.

778
00:46:43,459 --> 00:46:47,062
I'll take the overpriced beluga.

779
00:46:48,264 --> 00:46:50,532
<i>T.G.I.F.!</i>

780
00:46:50,534 --> 00:46:52,601
Wiggy.

781
00:46:55,172 --> 00:46:57,573
Okay.

782
00:46:57,575 --> 00:47:01,277
Let the game begin.

783
00:47:02,479 --> 00:47:04,580
<i>What? Buddha's not coming?
He watched the game already.</i>

784
00:47:04,582 --> 00:47:07,350
<i>Great. We all agree not to watch it,
and he watches the game.</i>

785
00:47:07,352 --> 00:47:10,453
<i>Ow! Why do you think these people
invented the VCR?</i>

786
00:47:10,455 --> 00:47:13,289
Hey.
What the fuck?

787
00:47:13,291 --> 00:47:16,159
What... I don't believe this shit.

788
00:47:16,161 --> 00:47:18,328
Well, you must have set
it wrong... the timer.

789
00:47:18,330 --> 00:47:20,764
Right.
Me... set a VCR timer wrong?

790
00:47:20,766 --> 00:47:24,468
Well, Brian, does she look
like a linebacker to you?

791
00:47:24,470 --> 00:47:26,336
Oh, shit.

792
00:47:26,338 --> 00:47:28,505
The chick must have taped it.

793
00:47:30,408 --> 00:47:32,342
Oh, Christ. this is some
sort of PBS thing.

794
00:47:32,344 --> 00:47:34,178
PBS? We're fucked.
Yeah.

795
00:47:34,180 --> 00:47:35,646
Oh, shit.
I'm sorry, guys.

796
00:47:35,648 --> 00:47:37,548
Fast-forward it.

797
00:47:41,487 --> 00:47:42,654
...channel 21...

798
00:47:42,656 --> 00:47:44,489
Chris Spunkhouser from
the Boston area.

799
00:47:44,491 --> 00:47:46,357
Oh. Now, Chris is in a real...

800
00:47:46,359 --> 00:47:48,626
Now they're gonna auction off
Leonard Bernstein's barcalounger!

801
00:47:48,628 --> 00:47:50,195
I'm sorry, guys.

802
00:47:50,197 --> 00:47:53,331
This is a nightmare.
you're losing control.

803
00:47:53,333 --> 00:47:54,732
I'm really sorry.

804
00:48:00,339 --> 00:48:02,173
Another?

805
00:48:02,175 --> 00:48:03,641
Mm...

806
00:48:05,345 --> 00:48:08,514
No.
I really shouldn't.

807
00:48:08,516 --> 00:48:11,650
I'm about to have my first affair.

808
00:48:11,652 --> 00:48:13,519
Oh.

809
00:48:13,521 --> 00:48:15,488
Well, then you really should.

810
00:48:15,490 --> 00:48:17,189
On the house.

811
00:48:18,659 --> 00:48:20,493
Hey, everybody,
this lady's just about...

812
00:48:20,495 --> 00:48:22,528
No. Shh.

813
00:48:22,530 --> 00:48:24,663
Don't tell anybody.

814
00:48:24,665 --> 00:48:26,198
I'm married.

815
00:48:26,200 --> 00:48:28,735
Ah.
Are you nervous?

816
00:48:28,737 --> 00:48:30,770
No.

817
00:48:32,540 --> 00:48:34,274
Why?

818
00:48:36,811 --> 00:48:39,446
I don't know.
Maybe a little, yeah.

819
00:48:39,448 --> 00:48:41,515
Ah, don't be.
You look great.

820
00:48:41,517 --> 00:48:43,717
You're gonna be fine.

821
00:48:46,488 --> 00:48:49,523
My husband doesn't
understand me.

822
00:48:50,425 --> 00:48:52,160
He never will.

823
00:48:54,463 --> 00:48:57,165
You deserve better.

824
00:49:00,502 --> 00:49:02,803
Do I?
Mm-hmm.

825
00:49:02,805 --> 00:49:06,307
To the man who really
understands you.

826
00:49:07,543 --> 00:49:09,510
Yeah.

827
00:49:09,512 --> 00:49:10,745
To Brian.

828
00:49:17,787 --> 00:49:22,491
<i># Sit right down
and let me tell you #</i>

829
00:49:26,663 --> 00:49:30,966
<i># What my love is to me</i>

830
00:49:34,672 --> 00:49:36,539
I do.

831
00:49:38,676 --> 00:49:44,447
<i># It's gonna be just dandy</i>

832
00:49:47,384 --> 00:49:51,487
<i># The day I take my candy</i>

833
00:49:55,233 --> 00:50:00,076
<i># And make her mine,
all mine #</i>

834
00:50:05,837 --> 00:50:10,474
<i># The day I take my candy</i>

835
00:50:11,034 --> 00:50:16,547
<i># And make her mine,
all mine #</i>

836
00:50:20,518 --> 00:50:22,019
<i>It's open.</i>

837
00:50:28,594 --> 00:50:30,528
<i>Hi.</i>

838
00:50:33,033 --> 00:50:35,533
<i>I'm Ellen.</i>

839
00:50:35,535 --> 00:50:37,002
Ellen?

840
00:50:39,406 --> 00:50:42,674
Oh, yeah, the painter chick.

841
00:50:42,676 --> 00:50:44,342
Well, come on in.

842
00:50:45,846 --> 00:50:48,914
Uh, I'm sorry. you're expecting
someone, aren't you?

843
00:50:48,916 --> 00:50:52,485
Oh, this?
Nah.

844
00:50:52,487 --> 00:50:56,489
<i>I had some company earlier,
but, uh...</i>

845
00:50:56,491 --> 00:50:57,857
They pussied out.

846
00:51:02,863 --> 00:51:06,399
I was just, um...

847
00:51:06,401 --> 00:51:08,467
in the neighborhood,
you know, and, um...

848
00:51:08,469 --> 00:51:10,404
I forgot my umbrella.

849
00:51:10,406 --> 00:51:11,538
Oh, yeah?
Yeah.

850
00:51:11,540 --> 00:51:13,573
Is it raining?
No.

851
00:51:13,575 --> 00:51:16,543
But it's so hot and sticky out,
I wish it would.

852
00:51:16,545 --> 00:51:19,046
It's funny, isn't it?

853
00:51:19,048 --> 00:51:23,684
All this time living
together, and, uh...

854
00:51:23,686 --> 00:51:25,519
We never actually meet.

855
00:51:25,521 --> 00:51:26,687
<i>Yeah.</i>

856
00:51:26,689 --> 00:51:28,555
But I liked your roses.

857
00:51:30,025 --> 00:51:32,026
Oh.

858
00:51:32,028 --> 00:51:33,494
Hey, um...

859
00:51:33,496 --> 00:51:35,396
Could you?

860
00:51:35,398 --> 00:51:37,832
Oh, yeah.

861
00:51:39,034 --> 00:51:40,568
You know, uh...

862
00:51:43,405 --> 00:51:46,541
You're exactly the way
I pictured you.

863
00:51:46,543 --> 00:51:48,710
I am?
Mm.

864
00:52:00,557 --> 00:52:03,492
So, Marty, you want to know
where I'm going tonight?

865
00:52:09,866 --> 00:52:11,567
Did you tell him we were closing?

866
00:52:11,569 --> 00:52:12,534
Yes.

867
00:52:14,405 --> 00:52:15,671
Sorry, Ramon.

868
00:52:15,673 --> 00:52:19,642
He's a kidder, Eddie.
Good night. Good night.

869
00:52:22,046 --> 00:52:24,581
So, Marty, aren't you gonna
ask me what I'm doing tonight?

870
00:52:24,583 --> 00:52:28,585
What's to ask? You go home,
you eat some tuna, you piddle. Unh-unh.

871
00:52:28,587 --> 00:52:31,588
I got tickets to see Neil
Diamond at The Coliseum.

872
00:52:31,590 --> 00:52:32,555
You're shitting me.

873
00:52:32,557 --> 00:52:35,058
Look at that.
Scalper.

874
00:52:35,060 --> 00:52:36,726
Ellen doesn't know about it.

875
00:52:36,728 --> 00:52:39,562
I'm gonna go up to Lucy's
and get her... surprise her.

876
00:52:39,564 --> 00:52:41,432
Wow.

877
00:52:44,536 --> 00:52:46,704
Pow.

878
00:52:46,706 --> 00:52:49,407
Something wrong with
the electricity in here?

879
00:52:49,409 --> 00:52:51,575
No, no, no.
It's fine.

880
00:52:51,577 --> 00:52:54,545
There's, uh, plenty between us.

881
00:52:56,883 --> 00:52:59,884
Yeah, right.

882
00:52:59,886 --> 00:53:02,553
Oh, that was sarcastic, right?
I shouldn't do that.

883
00:53:02,555 --> 00:53:03,921
I...

884
00:53:07,428 --> 00:53:09,728
God. I wish you had
your uniform on.

885
00:53:09,730 --> 00:53:11,730
I love those little white skirts.

886
00:53:17,905 --> 00:53:19,571
Um, you hungry?

887
00:53:19,573 --> 00:53:22,674
I have some, you know,
caviar, champagne.

888
00:53:31,052 --> 00:53:33,586
I'm, uh, just a little drunk.

889
00:53:34,889 --> 00:53:37,890
That's okay.
I like that in a woman.

890
00:53:37,892 --> 00:53:39,792
Oh.

891
00:53:42,062 --> 00:53:44,130
Good.

892
00:53:48,569 --> 00:53:49,936
Nah.

893
00:53:51,739 --> 00:53:54,241
Come on.

894
00:53:54,243 --> 00:53:56,510
What?

895
00:53:58,613 --> 00:54:01,215
We both know why you're here.

896
00:54:05,587 --> 00:54:07,621
Oh, shit.

897
00:54:11,059 --> 00:54:14,229
Lucy!
Hi, it's me... Aaron!

898
00:54:14,231 --> 00:54:16,731
Get my wife!
I got a surprise for her!

899
00:54:16,733 --> 00:54:19,067
Oh, shit.
What?!

900
00:54:19,069 --> 00:54:21,236
How sweet!

901
00:54:21,238 --> 00:54:24,906
Uh, it's too bad.
She's, um, not here!

902
00:54:24,908 --> 00:54:27,075
Where is she?

903
00:54:27,077 --> 00:54:30,245
Where is she?!
Oh, she...

904
00:54:30,247 --> 00:54:33,615
She had to go back to the city
all of a sudden!

905
00:54:33,617 --> 00:54:36,919
A dental-hygiene emergency!

906
00:54:36,921 --> 00:54:39,922
Oh, for crying out loud.

907
00:54:39,924 --> 00:54:41,090
When was this?

908
00:54:41,092 --> 00:54:42,591
Oh, God.
I don't know.

909
00:54:42,593 --> 00:54:44,760
You know me!
I'm just... ecch!

910
00:54:46,097 --> 00:54:48,597
Oh.

911
00:54:48,599 --> 00:54:51,567
Uh...
I guess I better wait.

912
00:54:51,569 --> 00:54:54,236
She's not gonna
want to miss this...

913
00:54:54,238 --> 00:54:55,905
Neil Diamond.

914
00:54:55,907 --> 00:54:57,573
Oh, you're kidding.

915
00:54:57,575 --> 00:55:00,744
Um, w... um,
she left a number.

916
00:55:00,746 --> 00:55:02,612
Maybe I can reach her.

917
00:55:02,614 --> 00:55:03,680
Great.

918
00:55:11,822 --> 00:55:14,624
Oh, look, how do I get this off?
Uh, it's really...

919
00:55:14,626 --> 00:55:17,694
I mean, what is this...
Beat the clock?

920
00:55:31,210 --> 00:55:35,246
All right, come on, baby.
Just let me lie down.

921
00:55:35,248 --> 00:55:37,315
Just relax.
Shh.

922
00:55:39,918 --> 00:55:42,587
Ay-yi-yi.

923
00:56:00,107 --> 00:56:02,274
Man...

924
00:56:02,276 --> 00:56:05,277
You came to play.

925
00:56:05,279 --> 00:56:08,947
Good windup, good delivery...

926
00:56:08,949 --> 00:56:11,150
good follow-through.

927
00:56:14,922 --> 00:56:16,656
What?

928
00:56:19,093 --> 00:56:22,261
Uh, just a little, uh,
play-by-play.

929
00:56:29,771 --> 00:56:32,673
Can you, like, hold me
or something?

930
00:56:34,776 --> 00:56:37,111
I thought we were done.

931
00:56:37,113 --> 00:56:38,779
Okay.

932
00:56:52,794 --> 00:56:55,397
You know, uh...

933
00:56:55,399 --> 00:56:57,966
You're really a great fuck.

934
00:57:00,102 --> 00:57:02,103
I can't believe you just said that.

935
00:57:02,105 --> 00:57:03,972
Oh, but it's true.

936
00:57:03,974 --> 00:57:06,441
Mm.

937
00:57:06,443 --> 00:57:09,110
No, I just...

938
00:57:09,112 --> 00:57:12,113
I don't know. I guess maybe
I thought you were...

939
00:57:12,115 --> 00:57:14,115
a little bit more romantic.

940
00:57:14,117 --> 00:57:16,418
I guess I don't really
know you, and...

941
00:57:16,420 --> 00:57:20,956
Brian McVeigh.
Dartmouth, class of '84.

942
00:57:20,958 --> 00:57:23,092
No, I mean, I...

943
00:57:24,394 --> 00:57:27,463
I guess I just had a different
image of you...

944
00:57:27,465 --> 00:57:30,299
with your music and...

945
00:57:30,301 --> 00:57:33,703
cooking and... furniture.

946
00:57:33,705 --> 00:57:36,739
Yeah, it's nice stuff, huh?

947
00:57:38,408 --> 00:57:40,443
<i>Oh, "Beyond the Fjord. "</i>

948
00:57:40,445 --> 00:57:43,780
Wasn't this a good movie.
I really liked this.

949
00:57:43,782 --> 00:57:46,283
I was so glad you
cut that ad out,

950
00:57:46,285 --> 00:57:48,118
and I found it.

951
00:57:48,120 --> 00:57:50,454
Right.
Me see a foreign movie?

952
00:57:50,456 --> 00:57:54,458
It's bad enough I got to go see
the, uh, ballet

953
00:57:54,460 --> 00:57:56,793
with my, uh, fiancé.

954
00:57:56,795 --> 00:57:58,462
Fiancé? Fian...

955
00:57:58,464 --> 00:58:00,030
Fiancé?!

956
00:58:01,466 --> 00:58:03,967
How could you?
It wasn't my idea.

957
00:58:03,969 --> 00:58:05,970
Her folks got us
season tickets...

958
00:58:05,972 --> 00:58:07,972
Every wednesday.

959
00:58:07,974 --> 00:58:09,440
Aren't you here wednesdays?

960
00:58:09,442 --> 00:58:13,277
No. That's why I had to switch
my nights with, uh...

961
00:58:14,446 --> 00:58:15,813
Uh...

962
00:58:15,815 --> 00:58:17,381
Sam?

963
00:58:18,924 --> 00:58:20,104
Oh...

964
00:58:21,248 --> 00:58:22,360
Oh...

965
00:58:23,456 --> 00:58:25,256
Oh, my God.
What?

966
00:58:25,931 --> 00:58:27,715
Oh, my God.
What?

967
00:58:27,928 --> 00:58:29,928
I slept with the wrong guy.

968
00:58:31,966 --> 00:58:33,398
Oh, my God.

969
00:58:33,400 --> 00:58:36,135
The one time in my life I cheat,
and I screw it up,

970
00:58:36,137 --> 00:58:37,436
and I sleep with the wrong guy.

971
00:58:37,438 --> 00:58:39,371
And you...
How could you?!

972
00:58:39,373 --> 00:58:42,374
It's... you know,
one last fling.

973
00:58:42,376 --> 00:58:45,811
A condemned man is entitled
to one last hearty breakfast.

974
00:58:45,813 --> 00:58:47,813
<i>Oh, shut up!</i>

975
00:58:47,815 --> 00:58:49,481
<i>What?
What did I say?</i>

976
00:58:49,483 --> 00:58:51,551
<i>I mean, how could you sleep
with me?!</i>

977
00:58:51,553 --> 00:58:55,455
Yeah, but that's because I
thought you were someone else.

978
00:58:55,457 --> 00:58:57,323
Boy...

979
00:58:57,325 --> 00:58:59,392
Way to make a guy feel wanted.

980
00:59:00,427 --> 00:59:02,962
I mean, you don't
even know me.

981
00:59:02,964 --> 00:59:04,798
<i>Well, at least I know
who you were.</i>

982
00:59:04,800 --> 00:59:07,300
<i>You're the babe who cooks
all that great food.</i>

983
00:59:07,302 --> 00:59:09,803
No, that is Sam, you idiot!

984
00:59:09,805 --> 00:59:12,005
You're the one with
the ugly furniture!

985
00:59:12,007 --> 00:59:13,807
No, baby,
You got it all wrong.

986
00:59:13,809 --> 00:59:17,311
This is my furniture.
His is the ugly stuff.

987
00:59:18,447 --> 00:59:21,482
Oh, my God.

988
00:59:21,484 --> 00:59:23,417
What? What?
What?

989
00:59:27,389 --> 00:59:28,989
Aaron.

990
00:59:34,997 --> 00:59:36,463
Chicks.

991
00:59:54,984 --> 00:59:56,985
Yeah?

992
00:59:56,987 --> 00:59:59,487
Can... can you take
me to Elmhurst?

993
00:59:59,489 --> 01:00:00,623
No, no, I don't know where it is.

994
01:00:00,625 --> 01:00:01,991
It's in queens.

995
01:00:01,993 --> 01:00:04,193
No, no, madam, that's very far.
Please.

996
01:00:04,195 --> 01:00:06,329
<i>Come on, no... please.
I need to go to Queens.</i>

997
01:00:06,331 --> 01:00:08,497
<i>Uh, but...</i>

998
01:00:08,499 --> 01:00:10,566
<i>Come on, lady.
Ple... Hello? Hello?</i>

999
01:00:10,568 --> 01:00:13,169
Please don't cry. I... I said
I'll take you to Queens.

1000
01:00:13,171 --> 01:00:15,004
I need to go to Queens.
We'll go to Queens.

1001
01:00:15,006 --> 01:00:18,007
Here. Here.
See? We go to Queens.

1002
01:00:21,179 --> 01:00:23,347
I slept with the wrong guy.

1003
01:00:23,349 --> 01:00:25,482
Don't be so hard on him, lady.

1004
01:00:25,484 --> 01:00:27,150
Give him a chance.

1005
01:00:27,152 --> 01:00:30,487
How could I be so stupid to
sleep with the wrong guy?!

1006
01:00:30,489 --> 01:00:32,623
Oh, don't worry.
You'll find the right guy.

1007
01:00:32,625 --> 01:00:34,291
You'll find a better guy.

1008
01:00:34,293 --> 01:00:35,993
<i>I have a better guy!</i>

1009
01:00:35,995 --> 01:00:37,461
<i>Then what's the problem?</i>

1010
01:00:37,463 --> 01:00:40,364
<i>Well, what am I gonna tell
my husband?</i>

1011
01:00:40,366 --> 01:00:42,633
Oh.
Don't tell him.

1012
01:00:42,635 --> 01:00:44,468
Don't tell him anything.

1013
01:00:44,470 --> 01:00:47,171
If he doesn't know,
he'll take you back.

1014
01:00:47,173 --> 01:00:49,974
But I don't want him to take me back.
But then what do you want?

1015
01:00:49,976 --> 01:00:51,643
I want Sam!

1016
01:00:51,645 --> 01:00:54,512
Now, who is Sam?
I don't know!

1017
01:00:55,982 --> 01:00:58,249
Oh!

1018
01:00:59,585 --> 01:01:02,020
Oh, there's something...
and what do you...

1019
01:01:02,022 --> 01:01:04,522
Madam, this is a taxi, madam,
not a bedroom.

1020
01:01:04,524 --> 01:01:06,491
I got to get...

1021
01:01:06,493 --> 01:01:08,192
Oh.

1022
01:01:08,194 --> 01:01:10,129
<i>Calm down.
Calm...</i>

1023
01:01:10,131 --> 01:01:12,631
<i>Here. Here, blow your...
I didn't mean to do it.</i>

1024
01:01:12,633 --> 01:01:16,435
<i>Calm.
Everything will be fine.</i>

1025
01:01:41,529 --> 01:01:43,563
Oh, shit.

1026
01:01:57,379 --> 01:01:59,013
The game was great.

1027
01:02:02,484 --> 01:02:05,353
Watched it twice...

1028
01:02:05,355 --> 01:02:07,121
with the guys.

1029
01:02:10,192 --> 01:02:11,492
Yeah...

1030
01:02:15,197 --> 01:02:16,564
Good night.

1031
01:02:48,665 --> 01:02:50,533
Brian?

1032
01:03:00,210 --> 01:03:02,478
Oh, Brian.

1033
01:03:09,521 --> 01:03:12,623
Brian, Brian, Brian, Brian, Brian.

1034
01:03:45,524 --> 01:03:48,226
<i>What have you been doing?</i>

1035
01:03:48,228 --> 01:03:49,561
I was out with Lucy.

1036
01:03:49,563 --> 01:03:52,531
Uh, you know, I was, uh...

1037
01:03:52,533 --> 01:03:55,501
No, I wasn't.
I was out.

1038
01:03:55,503 --> 01:03:57,369
Yeah, I know.

1039
01:04:00,540 --> 01:04:02,475
I'm sorry.

1040
01:04:02,477 --> 01:04:04,510
What are you sorry about?

1041
01:04:04,512 --> 01:04:07,446
Nothing happened to be sorry
about, right?

1042
01:04:08,682 --> 01:04:11,650
No, something happened.

1043
01:04:13,520 --> 01:04:15,589
Just like that.

1044
01:04:17,859 --> 01:04:20,193
Just like that.

1045
01:04:20,195 --> 01:04:23,263
You're buying houses...

1046
01:04:24,699 --> 01:04:26,399
without telling me, Aaron.

1047
01:04:26,401 --> 01:04:28,468
You know, you're naming children.
And...

1048
01:04:28,470 --> 01:04:30,137
It's not my fault.

1049
01:04:30,139 --> 01:04:32,139
I'm not screwing around.

1050
01:04:33,574 --> 01:04:35,842
Don't blame me 'cause
you're having an affair.

1051
01:04:35,844 --> 01:04:39,180
<i>I don't know why I did it.
I... I, uh...</i>

1052
01:04:39,182 --> 01:04:42,850
It didn't even mean
anything, anyway.

1053
01:04:47,556 --> 01:04:49,557
Maybe I did it 'cause
I'm trying to tell you,

1054
01:04:49,559 --> 01:04:53,227
and I'm t-trying to tell myself

1055
01:04:53,229 --> 01:04:54,862
<i>that I'm not happy.</i>

1056
01:04:54,864 --> 01:04:56,731
Ellen...

1057
01:04:58,400 --> 01:05:01,336
If I want to get your attention...

1058
01:05:02,572 --> 01:05:05,207
I don't throw a rock at your head.

1059
01:05:05,209 --> 01:05:07,543
<i>All you had to do
was say something.</i>

1060
01:05:07,545 --> 01:05:10,879
How could you buy a house
without telling me?

1061
01:05:12,582 --> 01:05:14,449
I love you.

1062
01:05:16,553 --> 01:05:18,520
That's what you do.

1063
01:05:18,522 --> 01:05:20,556
You marry, you...

1064
01:05:20,558 --> 01:05:22,391
you buy a house,
you have children.

1065
01:05:22,393 --> 01:05:23,860
That's what you do.

1066
01:05:29,400 --> 01:05:31,868
You should have told me.

1067
01:05:41,712 --> 01:05:45,415
I'm gonna pretend this
didn't happen, okay?

1068
01:05:45,417 --> 01:05:47,751
Uh, neither of us
will mention it.

1069
01:05:53,592 --> 01:05:55,559
I'm sorry...

1070
01:05:55,561 --> 01:05:57,728
Aaron.

1071
01:05:57,730 --> 01:05:59,230
<i>Oh, what for?</i>

1072
01:05:59,232 --> 01:06:01,398
Nothing happened.

1073
01:06:01,400 --> 01:06:03,500
Nothing's changed.

Less.

1083
01:06:39,340 --> 01:06:40,640

Sam, are you all right?

1096
01:07:04,066 --> 01:07:06,566
Guess who's coming to dinner.

Good.

1108
01:07:45,576 --> 01:07:48,010
It's pasta with duck.

Dog? Dog?

1110
01:07:51,582 --> 01:07:54,083
Dog? No. Oh, no, no, no,
no, duck. Duck.

1111
01:07:54,085 --> 01:07:57,586
Um, um, not dog.
Not dog.

1112
01:07:57,588 --> 01:07:59,621
Uh...

1113
01:07:59,623 --> 01:08:01,757
Duck.
Quack, quack, quack.

1114
01:08:01,759 --> 01:08:04,560
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Duck. Little duck.

1115
01:08:15,706 --> 01:08:19,509
More.
We need more wine.

1116
01:08:20,878 --> 01:08:24,514
I'll go get some,
and I will be right back.

1117

I go.
I go?

1118

<i>No, no.

Hello.

01:08:56,416 --> 01:08:57,716
Aaah!

1127
01:09:02,622 --> 01:09:06,425
How much are these potatoes?

1128
01:09:06,427 --> 01:09:08,627
How...

1129
01:09:18,573 --> 01:09:19,739
<i>Hello?</i>

1130
01:09:22,644 --> 01:09:25,545
You're welcome.
My name is Inga.

1131
01:09:26,780 --> 01:09:28,714
Hello?

1132
01:09:36,056 --> 01:09:37,858
Hello?

1133
01:09:52,807 --> 01:09:54,908
<i>Hi.</i>

1134
01:09:54,910 --> 01:09:56,810
Hi.

1135
01:10:01,917 --> 01:10:03,618
Oh, Inga.

1136
01:10:05,221 --> 01:10:08,089
Inga, you waited.

1137
01:10:42,259 --> 01:10:44,226
You are welcome to me.

1138
01:10:45,830 --> 01:10:49,266
Thank you, God.

1139
01:11:38,585 --> 01:11:40,085
Hi.

1140
01:11:40,087 --> 01:11:41,753
Do you know who
lives next door?

1141
01:11:41,755 --> 01:11:44,256
No.
No.

1142
01:11:46,093 --> 01:11:47,259
<i>Ooh!</i>

1143
01:11:47,261 --> 01:11:49,761
You wouldn't believe
what goes on in there.

1144
01:11:49,763 --> 01:11:51,096
<i>Oooh!</i>

1145
01:11:51,098 --> 01:11:53,265
This one's a painter.
That one's a cook.

1146
01:11:53,267 --> 01:11:55,300
What about the roses
from Brian?

1147
01:11:55,302 --> 01:11:57,937
Have you, um...

1148
01:11:57,939 --> 01:12:00,239
Have you seen him
in there before?

1149
01:12:00,241 --> 01:12:02,108
Maybe.
I don't know for sure.

1150
01:12:02,110 --> 01:12:05,211
You don't know?
He forgets.

1151
01:12:06,281 --> 01:12:07,614
Twice a week he comes.

1152
01:12:07,616 --> 01:12:09,248
Uh, like clockwork.

1153
01:12:09,250 --> 01:12:12,251
But like I said, it's his own
business what he does.

1154
01:12:12,253 --> 01:12:14,387
And, um... and the girl?

1155
01:12:14,389 --> 01:12:15,989
Oh, don't know this one.

1156
01:12:15,991 --> 01:12:19,392
There's another.
Oh, oh, painter. Ooh-ooh.

1157
01:12:19,394 --> 01:12:21,228
Twice a week.
Like clockwork.

1158
01:12:21,230 --> 01:12:22,763
Thank you.

1159
01:12:22,765 --> 01:12:24,098
I just...
I got to go now.

1160
01:12:24,100 --> 01:12:25,766
But like I said,
that's his business.

1161
01:12:25,768 --> 01:12:27,034
<i>We don't see a thing.</i>

1162
01:12:27,036 --> 01:12:30,104
Fjord. Oslo.

1163
01:12:33,275 --> 01:12:37,177
<i>Ahhh.</i>

1164
01:12:39,981 --> 01:12:42,282
Mm. Mm.

1165
01:12:43,176 --> 01:12:48,423
Son of a bitch? Son of a bitch?
Oh, you no-good son of a bitch!

1166
01:12:48,425 --> 01:12:50,792
<i>What? What?</i>

1167
01:12:50,794 --> 01:12:54,429
<i>Okay, where's Brian?</i>

1168
01:12:54,431 --> 01:12:55,730
Huh?

1169
01:12:55,732 --> 01:12:56,931
Uh...
Who is Brian?

1170
01:12:56,933 --> 01:12:59,234
I... I... I think that you have
the wrong night.

1171
01:12:59,236 --> 01:13:02,103
<i>No, no, no, stay. Calm down.
Oh, bullshit!</i>

1172
01:13:02,105 --> 01:13:03,905
<i>Calm down. Stay.
Where is he?</i>

1173
01:13:03,907 --> 01:13:06,942
L - lady, please, I beg you.

1174
01:13:06,944 --> 01:13:09,178
<i>Come out,
you son of a bitch!</i>

1175
01:13:09,180 --> 01:13:10,846
No. no, no, no, no.
Stay.

1176
01:13:10,848 --> 01:13:12,415
No, no, no.
I... I can explain.

1177
01:13:12,417 --> 01:13:14,417
See, I don't actually,
uh, live here alone.

1178
01:13:14,419 --> 01:13:16,118
<i>I mean, I do,
when I have the place,</i>

1179
01:13:16,120 --> 01:13:19,088
<i>but I... I only have the place
t - two nights a week.</i>

1180
01:13:19,090 --> 01:13:21,123
It's kind of a - a
timeshare thing.

1181
01:13:21,125 --> 01:13:23,426
<i>Um, you know, this new
york space is tight. No!</i>

1182
01:13:23,428 --> 01:13:25,428
Lady, stop!
Stop!

1183
01:13:25,430 --> 01:13:26,796
<i>Stop. Stop.</i>

1184
01:13:26,798 --> 01:13:28,264
Anyway, this woman
seems to be looking

1185
01:13:28,266 --> 01:13:30,000
for one of the co-tenants.

1186
01:13:30,002 --> 01:13:34,137
And, uh, uh, evidently they've
been having some discord.

1187
01:13:34,139 --> 01:13:35,882
Get out!
Get out! Get out!

1188
01:13:36,316 --> 01:13:37,941
Get out!
Get out! Get out!

1189
01:13:37,943 --> 01:13:39,943
Take it ea...
No, Inga.

1190
01:13:39,945 --> 01:13:44,114
You're welcome to me.
You're welcome to me. Out!

1191
01:13:44,116 --> 01:13:45,449
Inga.

1192
01:13:48,953 --> 01:13:50,954
Inga!

1193
01:14:01,266 --> 01:14:03,801
I don't know who you are...

1194
01:14:03,803 --> 01:14:06,304
or what you're doing here...

1195
01:14:06,306 --> 01:14:08,139
but I want you to know

1196
01:14:08,141 --> 01:14:10,975
you have just committed
the single cruelest act

1197
01:14:10,977 --> 01:14:12,977
since they shot Babar's mom.

1198
01:14:12,979 --> 01:14:14,178
I'm sorry.

1199
01:14:14,180 --> 01:14:15,981
You're sorry?

1200
01:14:15,983 --> 01:14:18,984
You come barging
into a stranger's house

1201
01:14:18,986 --> 01:14:20,953
at the worst possible moment,

1202
01:14:20,955 --> 01:14:23,255
and you have no idea
how much I needed

1203
01:14:23,257 --> 01:14:27,126
or how long I've been waiting
for that worst possible moment.

1204
01:14:27,128 --> 01:14:30,796
You destroyed my one chance
of happiness in this world,

1205
01:14:30,798 --> 01:14:33,132
and you're sorry?

1206
01:14:33,134 --> 01:14:35,300
I was looking for Brian.

1207
01:14:35,302 --> 01:14:38,304
Oh, well, he's not here.

1208
01:14:38,306 --> 01:14:39,973
I'm Sam.

1209
01:14:39,975 --> 01:14:42,142
This is my night!

1210
01:14:42,144 --> 01:14:44,144
What does that have to do
with anything?!

1211
01:14:44,146 --> 01:14:45,445
Have you ever heard
of knocking

1212
01:14:45,447 --> 01:14:48,448
before coming into
a stranger's home?!

1213
01:14:48,450 --> 01:14:51,451
Well, I thought that he
was having an affair!

1214
01:14:51,453 --> 01:14:53,153
Brian?

1215
01:14:53,155 --> 01:14:55,321
The developmentally stunted,

1216
01:14:55,323 --> 01:14:57,991
consumer-obsessed, color-blind,

1217
01:14:57,993 --> 01:15:01,327
white-bread-eating man-child
trapped in a pudgy body

1218
01:15:01,329 --> 01:15:02,429
having an affair?!

1219
01:15:02,431 --> 01:15:05,266
I don't think so!

1220
01:15:05,268 --> 01:15:08,402
You are talking about
my husband-to-be.

1221
01:15:09,971 --> 01:15:12,439
I have never actually met him.

1222
01:15:12,441 --> 01:15:16,811
I'm just piecing it together
from clues.

1223
01:15:16,813 --> 01:15:19,847
Well, he's having an affair.

1224
01:15:21,817 --> 01:15:23,284
You're gonna marry him.

1225
01:15:23,286 --> 01:15:25,387
You have to sleep with him.

1226
01:15:29,292 --> 01:15:30,458
From what I can tell,

1227
01:15:30,460 --> 01:15:33,829
he uses this place
as a clubhouse.

1228
01:15:33,831 --> 01:15:35,463
It's some kind of tree house

1229
01:15:35,465 --> 01:15:37,299
for him and his fraternity friends.

1230
01:15:37,301 --> 01:15:38,466
They're brokers.

1231
01:15:38,468 --> 01:15:40,168
Sue me.

1232
01:15:40,170 --> 01:15:43,004
I thought that he was
having an affair.

1233
01:15:43,006 --> 01:15:44,906
Lady, is it possible

1234
01:15:44,908 --> 01:15:47,275
that you're being
sexually paranoid?

1235
01:15:47,277 --> 01:15:49,912
Who would sleep
with this palooka?

1236
01:15:51,982 --> 01:15:53,916
A painter.

1237
01:15:55,986 --> 01:15:57,386
Ellen?

1238
01:15:58,455 --> 01:16:00,990
Twice a week for months.

1239
01:16:00,992 --> 01:16:02,491
How do you know?

1240
01:16:03,994 --> 01:16:05,928
The neighbors.

1241
01:16:07,164 --> 01:16:09,332
I don't even have to
know the woman,

1242
01:16:09,334 --> 01:16:11,168
and she betrays me.

1243
01:16:11,170 --> 01:16:15,005
You're in love with her, too.
This is disgusting.

1244
01:16:15,007 --> 01:16:17,341
Calm down, lady.

1245
01:16:17,343 --> 01:16:19,009
I don't even know her.

1246
01:16:19,011 --> 01:16:21,178
We wrote each other
a few notes.

1247
01:16:21,180 --> 01:16:23,647
I built a window box
for a basil plant.

1248
01:16:23,649 --> 01:16:25,649
She went nuts on me.

1249
01:16:26,985 --> 01:16:30,287
Well, I'm gonna kill him.
And the wedding's off.

1250
01:16:30,289 --> 01:16:33,624
Shut up.

1251
01:16:33,626 --> 01:16:36,327
You're upset.

1252
01:16:36,329 --> 01:16:38,296
Your feelings are hurt.

1253
01:16:38,298 --> 01:16:41,633
Try to keep some perspective.
You love this guy.

1254
01:16:41,635 --> 01:16:43,635
Have you eaten?

1255
01:16:43,637 --> 01:16:45,236
I thought I did.

1256
01:16:47,006 --> 01:16:48,306
You love him...

1257
01:16:48,308 --> 01:16:52,377
So if you want him back,
you'll get him back...

1258
01:16:53,646 --> 01:16:56,481
Just as long as you
don't freak out.

1259
01:16:56,483 --> 01:16:59,351
Sex is a little bit like politics.

1260
01:16:59,353 --> 01:17:02,354
The incumbent always
has the advantage.

1261
01:17:03,490 --> 01:17:05,658
How romantic.

1262
01:17:05,660 --> 01:17:07,426
<i>When something
like this happens,</i>

1263
01:17:07,428 --> 01:17:10,930
the best thing you can do
is just accept it.

1264
01:17:12,332 --> 01:17:16,635
If you try to make him do something
that he doesn't want to do, he'll resent it.

1265
01:17:16,637 --> 01:17:20,373
And it'll come up later somehow.

1266
01:17:22,643 --> 01:17:24,244
Did you cook this?

1267
01:17:24,246 --> 01:17:28,014
Look, all that i'm saying is...

1268
01:17:28,016 --> 01:17:30,617
you can't change somebody...

1269
01:17:30,619 --> 01:17:32,652
not overnight.

1270
01:17:32,654 --> 01:17:35,322
If you take away his freedom,

1271
01:17:35,324 --> 01:17:39,192
he'll feel it... choked.

1272
01:17:39,194 --> 01:17:42,395
That's probably why he kept this
apartment in the first place.

1273
01:17:44,032 --> 01:17:47,501
If you let him choose,
he'll choose you.

1274
01:17:50,005 --> 01:17:53,007
Boy, Sam, I'll bet you're really
good at relationships.

1275
01:17:53,009 --> 01:17:55,009
Me?

1276
01:17:55,011 --> 01:17:57,011
A genius.

1277
01:17:57,013 --> 01:17:58,279
Mmm.

1278
01:17:58,281 --> 01:18:01,182
<i>This is really good.</i>

1279
01:18:01,184 --> 01:18:03,351
<i>Thank you.</i>

1280
01:18:03,353 --> 01:18:05,353
<i>Do you have wine?</i>

1281
01:18:05,355 --> 01:18:07,222
<i>Yeah, sure.</i>

1282
01:18:23,506 --> 01:18:26,041
Brian, you're awake.

1283
01:18:26,043 --> 01:18:27,743
We need to talk.

1284
01:18:31,315 --> 01:18:35,284
It's okay.
We don't have to talk.

1285
01:18:36,487 --> 01:18:40,189
<i>We're both a little jumpy
these days,</i>

1286
01:18:40,191 --> 01:18:41,357
<i>and, uh...</i>

1287
01:18:41,359 --> 01:18:43,726
I think it's only natural.

1288
01:18:47,164 --> 01:18:49,032
Shh. Uh-oh.
Here he comes.

1289
01:18:52,037 --> 01:18:54,338
<i>So, uh, if you could tell
Mr. Jameson</i>

1290
01:18:54,340 --> 01:18:56,673
we can, uh, do a lunch

1291
01:18:56,675 --> 01:18:59,676
at, uh, 2:00 at Raul's.

1292
01:18:59,678 --> 01:19:01,678
Cut it off! Cut it off!
Cut it off!

1293
01:19:01,680 --> 01:19:03,380
Huh!
Whoo-whoo-whoo!

1294
01:19:03,382 --> 01:19:05,215
Wiggy, wiggy, wiggy!
Wiggy, wiggy, wiggy!

1295
01:19:06,385 --> 01:19:08,218
Well...

1296
01:19:08,220 --> 01:19:10,687
guys, you've, uh...

1297
01:19:10,689 --> 01:19:12,823
really outdone yourselves
this time.

1298
01:19:12,825 --> 01:19:15,827
This is really, uh...

1299
01:19:15,829 --> 01:19:17,662
thoughtless.

1300
01:19:17,664 --> 01:19:20,832
Mrs. Winkler,
could you dispose of this?

1301
01:19:20,834 --> 01:19:24,502
A - and also,
I... I think it's time we got...

1302
01:19:24,504 --> 01:19:26,838
rid of the lion's den.

1303
01:19:26,840 --> 01:19:29,841
So notify the tenants.

1304
01:19:29,843 --> 01:19:31,209
<i>Ellen?</i>

1305
01:19:31,211 --> 01:19:32,844
Sorry.
Thanks.

1306
01:19:32,846 --> 01:19:35,080
Thanks for the rush.

1307
01:19:35,082 --> 01:19:36,681
I got a really big night
on the town tonight.

1308
01:19:36,683 --> 01:19:38,216
Oh, yeah, you want
to take my wife?

1309
01:19:38,218 --> 01:19:40,219
She likes big nights
out on the town.

1310
01:19:40,221 --> 01:19:41,520
Right, Marty?

1311
01:19:41,522 --> 01:19:43,355
Uh...

1312
01:19:43,357 --> 01:19:45,691
All right, thanks.

1313
01:19:47,695 --> 01:19:49,228
<i>Hi.
Hi.</i>

1314
01:19:49,230 --> 01:19:52,364
I spilled some wine.
I'm afraid it's ruined.

1315
01:19:52,366 --> 01:19:53,399
Hi, Aaron.

1316
01:19:53,401 --> 01:19:54,667
Hi, Suzanne.
How are you?

1317
01:19:54,669 --> 01:19:56,302
<i>Good.</i>

1318
01:19:56,304 --> 01:19:59,338
You are so lucky to have him.

1319
01:20:01,843 --> 01:20:03,276
<i>Anyway, it's, uh...</i>

1320
01:20:03,278 --> 01:20:05,445
I think it'll come out.
No one will notice.

1321
01:20:05,447 --> 01:20:08,682
You see how she thinks, Marty?
Ellen, this is silk.

1322
01:20:08,684 --> 01:20:13,353
Don't listen to her promises.
We can touch it up. It won't go away.

1323
01:20:13,355 --> 01:20:15,489
He's so honest.

1324
01:20:17,391 --> 01:20:18,525
Thank you.

1325
01:20:18,527 --> 01:20:20,527
See you.
Bye.

1326
01:20:20,529 --> 01:20:23,363
Ellen, if it's ruined,
tell them it's ruined.

1327
01:20:23,365 --> 01:20:25,299
My wife...

1328
01:20:25,301 --> 01:20:26,701
thinks she can fix everything.

1329
01:20:26,703 --> 01:20:29,403
Everything can be fixed.

1330
01:20:31,907 --> 01:20:34,876
Oh! I knew we should have
taken Northern Boulevard.

1331
01:20:34,878 --> 01:20:36,577
<i>Aaron, it happens.</i>

1332
01:20:36,579 --> 01:20:39,213
We took a wrong turn,
and we're stuck in traffic.

1333
01:20:39,215 --> 01:20:40,381
<i>Right. Right.</i>

1334
01:20:40,383 --> 01:20:41,749
Fast.

1335
01:20:41,751 --> 01:20:43,451
Right?
Right, fast.

1336
01:20:43,453 --> 01:20:45,219
It's moving now.

1337
01:20:45,221 --> 01:20:46,387
<i>All right.
Move.</i>

1338
01:20:46,389 --> 01:20:47,388
<i>All right!
Right Le...</i>

1339
01:20:48,692 --> 01:20:50,459
No, you missed it.

1340
01:20:50,461 --> 01:20:52,594
<i>You missed it.</i>

1341
01:20:52,596 --> 01:20:55,364
Oh, this is great.

1342
01:20:55,366 --> 01:20:57,366
I told you the right lane.
you don't listen.

1343
01:20:57,368 --> 01:20:58,700
You're so stupid.

1344
01:20:58,702 --> 01:21:00,769
<i>Why don't you
let me drive?</i>

1345
01:21:02,705 --> 01:21:03,872
<i>Now what?</i>

1346
01:21:03,874 --> 01:21:05,374
<i>You want to drive?</i>

1347
01:21:06,710 --> 01:21:08,777
Drive.

1348
01:21:58,398 --> 01:22:01,233
Fellas, fellas, fellas,
it's a private party.

1349
01:22:01,235 --> 01:22:02,434
Get bent, man.

1350
01:22:02,436 --> 01:22:04,236
I think you're a cowboy...

1351
01:22:04,238 --> 01:22:07,539
Samuel, one codependents
anonymous meeting, just one.

1352
01:22:07,541 --> 01:22:10,375
Look what it's done for me.

1353
01:22:10,377 --> 01:22:11,543
Shit!
Uh-oh!

1354
01:22:11,545 --> 01:22:13,378
Club-soda stain.

1355
01:22:13,380 --> 01:22:14,879
Better get a little red wine.

1356
01:22:14,881 --> 01:22:17,816
It'll lift that club soda
right out of there.

1357
01:22:20,386 --> 01:22:22,388
Pastel.

1358
01:22:22,390 --> 01:22:24,390
Oh, Sammy!
Sammy!

1359
01:22:24,392 --> 01:22:26,259
How the hell are you?

1360
01:22:26,261 --> 01:22:28,728
Oh, do you have my VCR tape?

1361
01:22:28,730 --> 01:22:30,896
Oh, jeez, I... I didn't know

1362
01:22:30,898 --> 01:22:33,399
that you were gonna be at the
gallery, so I didn't bring it.

1363
01:22:33,401 --> 01:22:34,767
But I have it,

1364
01:22:34,769 --> 01:22:37,903
and I'm sure that I can get it
to you some other time.

1365
01:22:40,408 --> 01:22:41,907
Aah!

1366
01:22:43,343 --> 01:22:44,378
I'm over her.

1367
01:22:44,380 --> 01:22:46,413
You're better off.

1368
01:22:46,415 --> 01:22:48,415
What?
You're better off.

1369
01:22:48,417 --> 01:22:50,050
Yeah.

1370
01:22:50,052 --> 01:22:53,387
Uh, come, Sammy.

1371
01:22:53,389 --> 01:22:55,389
Let's dance.

1372
01:22:55,391 --> 01:22:58,959
Oh. I don't know if...
Aah! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!

1373
01:22:58,961 --> 01:23:01,428
<i>Excuse me.
Ow!</i>

1374
01:23:01,430 --> 01:23:04,431
Come. come, come, come, come.
Come on.

1375
01:23:04,433 --> 01:23:05,399
Come, come.

1376
01:23:05,401 --> 01:23:07,635
I'm kind of drunk, Pastel.

1377
01:23:07,637 --> 01:23:11,439
I don't think this is a good idea.
Yes, it is.

1378
01:23:14,443 --> 01:23:15,743
Bark, bark.

1379
01:23:15,745 --> 01:23:18,713
Come on.

1380
01:23:18,715 --> 01:23:21,549
Whoo!

1381
01:23:21,551 --> 01:23:24,319
<i>Pastel, you can't do this.
Why not?</i>

1382
01:23:24,321 --> 01:23:25,887
Come on, stop.

1383
01:23:25,889 --> 01:23:27,555
Uh...

1384
01:23:27,557 --> 01:23:29,424
No, no, no.
Get up. You can't...

1385
01:23:29,426 --> 01:23:30,659
Get up.
Ooh-whee!

1386
01:23:30,661 --> 01:23:32,428
You can't keep
picking people up

1387
01:23:32,430 --> 01:23:33,862
and using them whenever
you want to.

1388
01:23:33,864 --> 01:23:36,865
Oh!
Since when?

1389
01:23:38,468 --> 01:23:41,470
<i>Sammy, why are you
so serious?</i>

1390
01:23:41,472 --> 01:23:43,372
Pastel.
Just cut the shit, Pastel!

1391
01:23:43,374 --> 01:23:44,940
It's enough!
Aah!

1392
01:23:44,942 --> 01:23:46,508
Aah!

1393
01:24:04,428 --> 01:24:06,896
Aah! Oh!

1394
01:24:10,067 --> 01:24:11,768
<i>Goodbye, Pastel.</i>

1395
01:24:15,406 --> 01:24:19,076
Bye... everybody.

1396
01:24:19,078 --> 01:24:21,912
It's been a great party.

1397
01:24:21,914 --> 01:24:24,582
See you, kids.

1398
01:24:24,584 --> 01:24:25,950
Bye.

1399
01:24:29,589 --> 01:24:32,056
<i>Oh, merci.</i>

1400
01:24:43,102 --> 01:24:44,770
It's okay.

1401
01:24:44,772 --> 01:24:47,439
So I'm alone now.

1402
01:24:47,441 --> 01:24:50,575
Lots of people are alone,
and they love it.

1403
01:24:50,577 --> 01:24:53,445
Hermits are alone.

1404
01:24:53,447 --> 01:24:55,914
Mass murderers.

1405
01:24:55,916 --> 01:24:57,582
Postal clerks.

1406
01:24:57,584 --> 01:24:59,451
It's not so bad.

1407
01:25:07,094 --> 01:25:09,429
At least I've got the place.

1408
01:25:12,466 --> 01:25:14,100
The hearth.

1409
01:25:15,602 --> 01:25:18,104
The sanctuary.

1410
01:25:23,477 --> 01:25:24,777
Hmm.

Excuse me.

Who are you?
What are you doing here?

1434
01:28:45,322 --> 01:28:47,656
I'm sorry.

1435
01:28:47,658 --> 01:28:50,825
My grandmother made this.

1436
01:28:50,827 --> 01:28:53,329
It's nice.
I...

1437
01:28:53,331 --> 01:28:56,999
I use it when I'm here.

1438
01:28:57,001 --> 01:28:58,401
Oh, great.

1439
01:28:58,403 --> 01:29:00,803
Do you also read my mail?

1440
01:29:01,972 --> 01:29:04,373
Look, I'm sorry.
I... I... I... I was...

1441
01:29:06,044 --> 01:29:08,744
I was stuck in the city,
and I... I tried to call my sister,

1442
01:29:08,746 --> 01:29:10,980
<i>and she wasn't home, and then I didn't
have anyplace else to go, so I...</i>

Oh...

1446
01:29:18,290 --> 01:29:20,791
You're Ellen...

1447
01:29:20,793 --> 01:29:23,160
the crazy painter lady
who yelled at me

1448
01:29:23,162 --> 01:29:25,996
because I put your basil plant
in a window box

1449
01:29:25,998 --> 01:29:28,131
that I built all by myself.

1450
01:29:28,133 --> 01:29:30,934
No, no, you see, I thought
Brian made the boxes and...

1451
01:29:30,936 --> 01:29:34,471
Brian's the guy who treated
your plants like dirt,

1452
01:29:34,473 --> 01:29:36,339
so you slept with him.

1453
01:29:36,341 --> 01:29:38,942
I'm the guy who left the notes
and leftovers

1454
01:29:38,944 --> 01:29:40,411
and did stuff around the house,

1455
01:29:40,413 --> 01:29:42,280
<i>so you treated me like dirt.</i>

1456
01:29:42,282 --> 01:29:44,215
That's not fair.
Are you crazy?

1457
01:29:44,217 --> 01:29:47,251
I know it's not fair.
It's what you did.

1458
01:29:47,253 --> 01:29:49,987
Yeah, well, you're not...
get mad at me about it.

1459
01:29:49,989 --> 01:29:51,856
<i>Listening to me.</i>

1460
01:29:51,858 --> 01:29:53,458
Why don't men ever listen?

1461
01:29:53,460 --> 01:29:55,827
Go away.

1462
01:29:55,829 --> 01:29:57,462
Come in.

1463
01:29:57,464 --> 01:29:59,163
<i>Who is it?</i>

1464
01:30:02,301 --> 01:30:04,103
Who is this clown?

1465
01:30:04,105 --> 01:30:07,473
Dartmouth, class of '84.
Dartmouth, class of '84.

1466
01:30:07,475 --> 01:30:09,475
Brian, meet Sam...
the woman-hater.

1467
01:30:09,477 --> 01:30:12,211
Oh, hey.
Nice to meet you.

1468
01:30:12,213 --> 01:30:14,313
Sorry to burst in on you
two lovebirds, but, uh...

1469
01:30:16,016 --> 01:30:17,850
Forgot my tux.

1470
01:30:17,852 --> 01:30:19,418
Ahh.

1471
01:30:19,420 --> 01:30:21,987
I don't want to keep my little
girl waiting at the altar,

1472
01:30:21,989 --> 01:30:23,155
you know what I mean?

1473
01:30:23,157 --> 01:30:25,357
Hey, can you tie this?

1474
01:30:26,460 --> 01:30:28,895
Yeah, sure. why not?
Oh, thanks.

1475
01:30:31,832 --> 01:30:34,434
Anything he says...
see what I mean?

1476
01:30:36,170 --> 01:30:37,403
What's his problem?

1477
01:30:37,405 --> 01:30:39,005
What's my problem?

1478
01:30:39,007 --> 01:30:41,341
You're throwing me out on
the street with no notice.

1479
01:30:41,343 --> 01:30:43,309
I don't know what
her problem is.

1480
01:30:43,311 --> 01:30:46,312
Well, I'm sorry, compadres,
but, uh...

1481
01:30:46,314 --> 01:30:48,548
You got to do what
you got to do.

1482
01:30:50,185 --> 01:30:51,485
Know what I mean?

1483
01:30:51,487 --> 01:30:54,021
Thanks, babe.

1484
01:30:54,023 --> 01:30:55,356
Mmm.

1485
01:30:58,360 --> 01:30:59,860
<i>Adios, amigos.</i>

1486
01:30:59,862 --> 01:31:01,862
Take care, man.

1487
01:31:03,031 --> 01:31:06,000
Well, listen, I'm sorry that
I yelled at you before.

1488
01:31:06,002 --> 01:31:07,935
<i>But I'm...</i>

1489
01:31:07,937 --> 01:31:09,470
I...

1490
01:31:10,338 --> 01:31:12,507
How can you sleep
with a guy like that?

1491
01:31:12,509 --> 01:31:14,309
You idiot!

1492
01:31:14,311 --> 01:31:16,044
I didn't mean to
sleep with him!

1493
01:31:16,046 --> 01:31:17,579
I meant to sleep with you!

1494
01:31:22,084 --> 01:31:23,485
Oh, well...

1495
01:31:23,487 --> 01:31:25,854
Well, that's okay.
You don't have to say that.

1496
01:31:25,856 --> 01:31:27,189
No. well, I did.

1497
01:31:27,191 --> 01:31:29,024
I bought clothes.

1498
01:31:29,026 --> 01:31:32,127
And I bought good food,
'cause I know you like food.

1499
01:31:32,129 --> 01:31:34,496
And I even bought caviar.

1500
01:31:41,038 --> 01:31:44,207
Chinese caviar?
Yes.

1501
01:31:44,209 --> 01:31:47,176
I just...

1502
01:31:47,178 --> 01:31:50,379
had the days confused, and...

1503
01:31:53,418 --> 01:31:55,484
Oops.
I'm sorry.

1504
01:31:55,486 --> 01:31:58,589
Listen, guys, you know,
I just realized something.

1505
01:32:00,191 --> 01:32:03,527
Just 'cause I'm giving up
the place doesn't mean, uh...

1506
01:32:04,495 --> 01:32:07,497
I'll tell Mrs. Winkler to sublet
it to the two of you...

1507
01:32:07,499 --> 01:32:09,032
for a while.

1508
01:32:09,034 --> 01:32:10,868
Uh, Brian?

1509
01:32:10,870 --> 01:32:13,871
Hey, pal, let me give you a tip.

1510
01:32:13,873 --> 01:32:16,340
One drink, and she's yours.

1511
01:32:20,379 --> 01:32:21,346
<i>Arrivederci!</i>

1512
01:32:21,348 --> 01:32:22,981

<i>Wiggy, wiggy, wiggy, wiggy!</i>

He's not such a bad guy.

1515
01:32:47,040 --> 01:32:49,375
Maybe I found a better guy.

1516
01:32:55,048 --> 01:32:56,215
I'm Sam.

<i># Head over heels,
something's wrong #</i>

1581
01:37:54,595 --> 01:37:57,596

it's much too strong #</i>

trying hard for so long #</i>

be bygones #</i>

that I can't bear #</i>

there for you to come back #</i>
