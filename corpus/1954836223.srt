00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,356
(turns on tap)

2
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:37,470
He's in a meeting, Michael.

3
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:42,992
Do you know that the third quarter
of schedule 47 is gone?

4
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:46,829
lt's 60 million in currency purchases
outlined, and it's gone.

5
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:49,838
- lt was a pleasure.
- l'll see you again.

6
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:52,838
Hey, what's goin' on?

7
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:56,270
Schedule 47 is off the computer.

8
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:01,155
- Did you check the backup file?
- Gone. Both gone.

9
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:02,679
Jeez.

10
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:05,234
l'm sorry. l wish l could help you, Michael.

11
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:09,148
- No, l'm sorry. l can't believe...
- lf you didn't get it done in time,

12
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:13,558
l suppose l can get Howard to pull me off
what l'm doing to give you a hand.

13
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:18,708
lf you really want me to, that is,
but it doesn't look too good.

14
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:27,028
The only people that have access to
that file are me and Leslie, Britt and you.

15
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:35,598
lf you're trying to say something,
why don't you just come out and say it?

16
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:54,748
- Michael, did you find it?
- No calls.

17
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:57,838
Oh, Michael, your... Michael?

18
00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:00,997
(mutters under his breath)

19
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,872
l just can't believe it.

20
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,197
- Forget it was Thursday?
- Jesus, you scared me.

21
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:09,232
Sorry. Are you ready for lunch?
l have to get back.

22
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:11,715
Oh, lunch. Jesus, l...

23
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:15,389
- You're not gonna cancel?
- No. l just haven't felt...

24
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:20,071
- Should l cancel dinner with my parents?
- No, of course not. l wanna do that.

25
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:23,875
They're a drag, but they have been sweet
about the wedding plans.

26
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,595
Which reminds me,
l'm having second thoughts.

27
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:29,870
- You are?
- God, that sounded terrible.

28
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:35,028
l just meant that October might not
be good for me. How's November for you?

29
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:38,118
Fine. November's fine.

30
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:42,233
Oh, l'm sorry, sweetie.
l didn't mean to scare you.

31
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:45,318
No, don't be silly. You didn't scare me.

32
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:49,558
l absolutely, positively
wanna get married...

33
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:52,518
this year.

34
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:56,553
And l absolutely, positively
wanna have a baby...

35
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:59,710
- next year.
- Ooh.

36
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:03,469
- What is it, Michael?
- Ooh. lt's my stomach.

37
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:08,435
l just feel like l can't breathe sometimes.
lt's just a stupid thing.

38
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:12,392
Do you want me to call
my father at the hospital?

39
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:14,476
- No, l'm all right.
- Better?

40
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:16,113
Yeah. Yeah.

41
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:20,836
l know you better than you know yourself.
These attacks are work related.

42
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:23,394
Not even 30, and you're
gonna be senior analyst.

43
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:26,796
- Someone is gonna be senior analyst.
- You know it will be you.

44
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:31,391
You're successful, for God's sake.
Try to relax and enjoy it.

45
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:34,080
All right. Yeah, you're right.

46
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:40,231
- lf you're feeling better, l have to get back.
- No, no, l'm fine. You should go.

47
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:42,112
OK.

48
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:50,958
Michael?

49
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:53,310
- Call me tonight?
- Sure.

50
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:55,351
Yeah. That'd be good.

51
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:04,196
Oh, Christ!

52
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:11,593
( ''Spiritual Healing'' by Toots)

53
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:22,190
(barmaid) Hi. What can l get ya?

54
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:24,550
(woman) Bourbon and water.

55
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:34,196
- $2.75.
- l can't find my damn wallet.

56
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:37,551
lf you could wait just a minute, please.

57
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:47,037
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

58
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:49,958
Looks like you're having
the same kind of day l am.

59
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:54,039
For your sake,
l hope your day was nothing like mine.

60
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:56,799
Supposed to be at the office?

61
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:58,672
Yeah.

62
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:05,200
Should've gone to Disneyland.

63
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:13,069
As a kid l wanted to get right off the boat
in the middle of Pirates of the Caribbean.

64
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:15,350
Just live there.

65
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:19,035
Son of a... bitch!

66
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:28,557
- You can't walk away from this, Karen.
- Not here, OK?

67
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:35,751
- What's he lookin' at?
- Take it easy, Will. He's just some drip.

68
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:39,316
- Thank you.
- He just bought me a drink, OK?

69
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:43,354
Why don't you take a hike, pal?

70
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:49,112
This is a public bar.
l can have a drink here, can't l?

71
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:54,477
- Jesus, Willie. Not again.
- You should've taken a hike.

72
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:58,229
- Jesus, all right. l just helped the girl...
- Now it's too late.

73
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:06,235
- Let him go.
- Yeah? What are you gonna do?

74
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,715
Let's find out.

75
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:20,554
Come on. Get the hell outta here.

76
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:22,432
(splutters)

77
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:39,276
(door unlocking)

78
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:45,716
(door shutting)

79
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:57,112
(fiancée) Hi, sweetheart. l wanted
to see if you were better. Call me later.

80
00:09:57,240 --> 00:10:00,152
- (beep)
- Hello? lt's Pismo.

81
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:02,714
l have to ask you something.
l'm coming over.

82
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:04,671
- (beep)
- Michael, it's Howard.

83
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:10,716
Patterson thinks there's some problem
with your schedule 47. Not true, is it?

84
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:13,957
By the way,
where were you this afternoon?

85
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:23,118
- When did you get this?
- (Michael) Two weeks ago.

86
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:27,677
- Why did you get this?
- l don't know. lt was on sale.

87
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:31,270
- Do you need it?
- That's not the point.

88
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:34,198
Better give it away to somebody.
Cut your losses.

89
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:37,995
- You're not making sense.
- Your life makes too much sense already.

90
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:40,873
You'll have an espresso machine
by next year.

91
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,436
- Pismo, what do you want? l gotta go.
- Why the rush all the time?

92
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,312
l left my wallet at the beach.

93
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:50,831
Better find your credit card so you
can charge some more video cameras.

94
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:53,793
You needed to ask me something.
Do you need money again?

95
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:57,230
- Why do you assume l need money?
- Do you?

96
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:02,517
- Yes.
- Fine. l'll write you a cheque.

97
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:06,831
You know what really drives me nuts?

98
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:10,555
You don't respect me.
l'm your older brother, your only brother!

99
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:13,513
- Don't do this.
- lt's true.

100
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:18,430
l just think you could do better than sitting
around smoking pot all day, that's all.

101
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:22,553
Does that mean l have to
just because l could?

102
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:25,478
Who says l could anyway?

103
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:28,910
l couldn't get a decent job
to save my life, and you know why.

104
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:32,271
Eight years ago. Six months
for possession. Nobody cares.

105
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:34,789
lt was dealing. Those people never forget.

106
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:37,992
- Hey, l'm out there trying.
- God.

107
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:42,079
Look, do we have go through this
every single time l loan you money?

108
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:45,510
lt's no big deal, all right?

109
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:47,596
Come on.

110
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:56,112
l'll call you if your wallet turns up,
but don't hold your breath, OK?

111
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:59,357
- And that's my office.
- OK.

112
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:00,833
Thank you.

113
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:36,839
(woman) l know you didn't want me to,
but l brought you something.

114
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:41,238
lt's just such a nightmare. This is
taking a lot longer than l had planned.

115
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:43,396
You really don't have to.

116
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:45,875
l want to. Please.

117
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:50,590
(man) You're so sweet.

118
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:04,112
Hey!

119
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:08,034
You're the guy from the bar, right?

120
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:10,515
The guy with the bottle, right?
Remember?

121
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:16,033
- l'm Michael. Why did you leave so fast?
- l didn't wanna stay for thank-yous.

122
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:19,197
Well, thank you anyway. l'm...

123
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:21,595
Do you live around here or...?

124
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:23,870
- No.
- Oh.

125
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:30,716
Thank you... anyway.

126
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:37,429
- Why didn't you back down?
- What?

127
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:40,313
The guy told you to take a hike.
Why didn't you?

128
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:42,749
l don't know.

129
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,956
l don't know.

130
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:51,074
You know that voice
that tells you what to do sometimes?

131
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:53,350
l guess l listened to it today.

132
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:56,040
lt sounds stupid, l suppose.

133
00:13:57,160 --> 00:13:59,116
l'm like that.

134
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:03,274
And l always listen to it.

135
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:07,990
l'm Alex. You wanna get a beer?

136
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:16,119
He's a conniving son of a bitch
and he gets ahead. That pisses me off.

137
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:20,677
Well, that's the way it works,
and he knows it.

138
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:24,315
He pulled that stunt to show you
he could and that you'd let him.

139
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:27,034
- l didn't let him...
- You did nothing about it.

140
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:29,958
lt won't be a computer file next time.

141
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:36,269
lt'll be your biggest account, or your girl.
You won't do anything about that either.

142
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:39,870
Same principle, just a bigger scale.
He understands that.

143
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,956
l like the guy.

144
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:47,516
- What's his name?
- Patterson.

145
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:51,311
- To Patterson.
- You've gotta be kidding me. No.

146
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:54,398
Come on. To Patterson.

147
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:57,516
Patterson.

148
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:02,959
What kind of man are you
that you'd drink to your enemies?

149
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:08,915
- This isn't funny.
- There.

150
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:13,315
Show Patterson that face.

151
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:17,156
Beat him at his own game.

152
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:23,672
(man) Dominant athletic woman.

153
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:28,874
- l think you're really gonna like this band.
- l can't stay long. l gotta be up early.

154
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,470
Come on. l get the feeling
you don't get out so much.

155
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:35,637
- Dominant athletic woman.
- Yeah, that's it.

156
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:36,715
Hi.

157
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:42,240
- Who is this band?
- Nymphs!

158
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,556
Nymphs!

159
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:55,992
What's inside an evil man's eyes?
l just had to know

160
00:15:56,120 --> 00:16:02,116
What's inside a stranger's eyes
l just had to know

161
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:12,351
Gentlemen, what can l do for you?

162
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:14,550
- Ready?
- Oh, uh, beer.

163
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:16,636
Tequila shot.

164
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:30,916
Oh, yeah.

165
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:46,950
- Are you going?
- No, but you are.

166
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:49,036
Go on. Get outta here.

167
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:52,356
- What?
- Go on.

168
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:57,356
Thank you, my friend.

169
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:12,278
What's inside an evil man's eyes
l just had to know

170
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:18,999
What's inside a stranger's eyes
l just had to know

171
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:25,275
What's inside a killer's eyes
l just had to know

172
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:32,990
What's inside a stranger's eyes
l just had to know

173
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:52,077
Hey, listen, can l get two
of whatever she's drinking?

174
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:12,838
Shit, my wallet! Hold on a second.

175
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:15,633
l don't believe it.

176
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:18,069
Yo, Reggie! Jessie!

177
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:29,878
What's inside a killer's eyes
l just had to know

178
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:31,955
Whoa.

179
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:36,312
- Excuse me. Are you all right?
- Where are you going?

180
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:53,555
- We're pleased you made this decision.
- We worked with him two years ago...

181
00:18:55,400 --> 00:19:00,349
Donna, can l have balance sheets
for the Tilburg account?

182
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:04,877
- Let's look at the 60-day figures.
- Of course.

183
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,958
- l understand you're a Lakers fan.
- l love basketball.

184
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:14,110
l have season tickets. l can't use them
next week. l'll send a couple over.

185
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:21,309
l have a great story. l took my girlfriend
a month ago. l was sure she'd hate it.

186
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:23,874
Ends up she turns out to be a great fan.

187
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,754
She loved it. She thought it was great.
She was screaming.

188
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:34,719
Gentlemen, will you excuse me
for one moment, please?

189
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:36,956
Certainly.

190
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:39,355
- Be right back.
- While we have time...

191
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:46,676
What have you done?

192
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:50,353
- What do you mean?
- You know damn well what l mean.

193
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:53,472
There are batting averages
in my section report.

194
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:58,720
Batting averages? Are you sure
they're not batting champions?

195
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:03,755
l'm in a meeting, you swine, with Howard
and two pension-fund administrators.

196
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:07,714
- Where's my section report?
- Where's my schedule 47?

197
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:14,799
- Patterson, is everything all right?
- Yes, Howard. Fine. One minute.

198
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:17,957
Michael, what's this l hear
about the schedule 47?

199
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:20,833
l don't know. lt's all set, ready to roll.

200
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:23,520
Good. So are we, so let's go.

201
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:25,392
Yeah.

202
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:34,915
l'm not admitting l did anything, of course.

203
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:36,678
Of course not.

204
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:42,079
But if you give me mine back,
l'll see if l can get you yours back.

205
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:45,318
What do you want?

206
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:48,637
- l want you to go down to your office...
- l'm in a meeting.

207
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:54,517
Go down to your office and
get my report back on line in 60 seconds.

208
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:11,597
Ruth? l'm gonna be here
for another two and a half hours.

209
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:15,998
Yeah, no, no, no, l'm fine.
l'm just tired. l wanna go to bed.

210
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:17,473
Yuh.

211
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:21,434
All right, well, say l'm sorry
to your parents, OK?

212
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:23,516
l'll call you in the morning.

213
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:25,596
l love you, too. Yup.

214
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:40,998
( ''Out of the Rain'' by Etta James)

215
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:00,710
- Get you something?
- l owe you that from last night.

216
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:02,796
lf you say so.

217
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:08,154
Uh, you want a drink or somethin'?

218
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:12,114
No, l'm just, uh...
l was looking for somebody.

219
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:13,992
Michael!

220
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:16,076
l was just looking for you.

221
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:19,431
- Tony, you know this guy?
- Yeah, he's cool.

222
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:22,028
He looks like a cop to me.

223
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:25,277
- Tony?
- Old joke. Let's get outta here.

224
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:26,799
- All right.
- Later.

225
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:28,478
Yeah. l won't wait up.

226
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:31,353
- You're staying here?
- Upstairs, for a while.

227
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:34,233
Hey, you got your car? Can l drive?

228
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:38,513
- So it worked?
- Yeah. l wish you could've seen his face.

229
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:40,870
- You watched?
- The whole time.

230
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:45,551
That's great. Always gotta stick around
and watch the fun. Watch 'em squirm.

231
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:48,030
Hey, how about some champagne?

232
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:54,358
(woman) Togomoshi would like to buy
item one and item 27 and item 28.

233
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:57,836
Right? Yes, this one and this one. Yes.

234
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:00,712
Jesus.

235
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:04,919
Field of opportunity.

236
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:06,598
Oh.

237
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:09,154
Excuse me.

238
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:18,397
Oh, really? Darling, l'd like to
introduce you to my husband, Dr Segal.

239
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:22,991
- And this is Maxwell...
- Cunningham. Nice to meet you, Doctor.

240
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:25,634
- My friends call me Don.
- Don. Good to see you.

241
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:29,230
- Didn't you know? She's dead.
- Dead? Chantal?

242
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:31,715
Mm-hm. Hans killed her.

243
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:34,877
Actually, Chantal asked him to do it.

244
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,036
She would have done it herself anyway.

245
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:42,154
After looking at these pictures all night,
l can't even think about anything like that.

246
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:44,953
(with foreign accent) Dominic!

247
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:46,832
Dominic!

248
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:52,588
l'm Franco. Look who's here - Claire.
l think you met last night.

249
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:54,995
- You remember?
- Of course.

250
00:23:55,120 --> 00:24:00,353
- l'm very sorry.
- Well, thank you... Don't worry about it.

251
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:04,439
- So, what do you think of the art?
- So derivative and without hope.

252
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:07,199
Without hope. Definitely without hope.

253
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:10,592
lt's great you've managed
to keep your spirits up.

254
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:13,757
lt must be very difficult for you. l'm sorry.

255
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:16,269
Yes, it, uh... it has been.

256
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:19,870
Well, l think we've seen
all there is to see here.

257
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,230
l know l have.

258
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:26,672
Hang on. l'm going to...
free myself from an entanglement.

259
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:30,076
- l'll be right back.
- What's going on here?

260
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:32,953
- She thinks your wife just died.
- What?

261
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:35,958
You're gonna fuck a fantasy,
may as well be a good one.

262
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:37,638
- Let's go.
- Yes, let's go.

263
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:39,512
Bueno.

264
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:47,431
l hardly even knew the man,
but André said he was fine, so l stayed.

265
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:51,633
The place was beautiful. You would've
loved it. lt overlooked the ocean.

266
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:54,797
- lt's so nice, Dominic.
- Yes, it is.

267
00:24:56,240 --> 00:25:00,074
- Does anybody want an espresso?
- No. His wife was insane.

268
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:02,919
- He had a wife?
- Yeah. Do you have any liquor?

269
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:06,077
- Yeah, whatever you'd like.
- Rum.

270
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:11,149
They were separated. He had changed
the locks, but she owned the place.

271
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:14,431
- Very nice.
- She tried to kill me.

272
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:17,154
She showed up with a big knife, so l split.

273
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:19,840
- Do you play?
- No, never.

274
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:25,953
- So, show me around, Dominic.
- All right.

275
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:28,230
Yeah, let's go upstairs first.

276
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:31,875
- Do you want me to get you anything?
- No, no, no. l'll get a beer.

277
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:36,073
- So, how long ago was this?
- Five years.

278
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:39,476
- l stayed on the island two more seasons.
- (knock at door)

279
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:43,354
- Where do you live now?
- ls that a sun deck?

280
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:49,672
- Who are you?
- A friend of Michael's.

281
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:53,429
- Who are you?
- l'm fine. ls Michael here?

282
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:55,710
He's busy.

283
00:25:55,840 --> 00:26:00,595
Tell him it's his brother.
Tell him l have the fear.

284
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:06,316
(whispers) l said he's busy.

285
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:08,396
Oh. OK.

286
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:13,390
Who are you? What are you doing here?

287
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:15,954
Helping Michael.

288
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:40,959
- Can l ask you something?
- l don't have it.

289
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:44,277
- Have what?
- Your accent.

290
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:47,392
You must be looking for it by now.

291
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:49,476
He told you?

292
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:53,637
l knew.

293
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:56,718
But he didn't wanna say anything.

294
00:27:56,840 --> 00:27:59,479
Some people just can't lie.

295
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:03,229
He's still very upset about Jasmin's death.

296
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:11,070
Listen.

297
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:13,509
- What?
- lt's Dominic.

298
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:23,918
Yeah.

299
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:27,400
l think l'd be good for him.

300
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:32,232
Sure.

301
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:44,512
(moaning on TV)

302
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:46,596
(Claire) Oh, God.

303
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:54,789
You make a very funny face
when you come.

304
00:28:56,680 --> 00:29:00,878
- Jesus Christ!
- No, no, no, you were just getting good.

305
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:04,436
- Relax. l thought you looked really good.
- (honking)

306
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:07,597
l thought you looked beautiful,
especially on top.

307
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:09,676
- Thanks.
- (honking)

308
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:12,155
My cab. Bye.

309
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:18,994
Just wait right here.

310
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:30,114
- Claire! Let me give you a ride.
- That's OK.

311
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:32,196
Just wait a second.

312
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:36,749
- Let me at least give you cab fare.
- l have money.

313
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:39,872
- Well, can l get your phone number?
- Why?

314
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,752
Why?

315
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:44,758
Well, l just... l mean, we...

316
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:49,396
Dominic. We just felt like it, so we did it.

317
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:51,272
Relax.

318
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:56,074
l just thought l might call you. That's all.

319
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:58,156
You're so sweet.

320
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:02,156
Get home safely.

321
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:08,719
- l can't believe you did that.
- l gave her to you.

322
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:11,400
- Gave her!
- Least you could do is say thank you.

323
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:15,149
l reminded her of your grief
towards Jasmin.

324
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:24,077
Michael, l don't mind you
giving away my Franco thing.

325
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:32,153
lt's smart to keep the dead wife though.
Confess to one lie, but continue another.

326
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:35,113
Nothing like it to confuse people.

327
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:40,637
l think she would have
gone for you without me.

328
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:42,716
She said we seem like brothers.

329
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:44,910
- She did?
- Yeah.

330
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:48,271
l knew you did something
cos that never happens to me.

331
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:50,152
lt does now.

332
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:01,756
Tell me what you want, Mick.

333
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:03,952
''Mick''?

334
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:09,230
Tell me what you want.
Tell me what you're afraid of.

335
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:12,472
l, uh...

336
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:17,192
Just for fun. Come on, tell me.
What are you afraid of?

337
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:24,436
l'm afraid of getting married, l guess.

338
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:26,516
That's easy. Don't.

339
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:30,196
Well, l'm engaged.

340
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:33,670
Why?

341
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:36,712
l didn't wanna lose her.

342
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:39,193
l...

343
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:49,389
l'm terrified of gettin' married.

344
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:51,992
Done.

345
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:57,358
Now tell me what you want.

346
00:31:57,480 --> 00:32:01,917
More than anything else in the world,
what do you want?

347
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:09,948
This guy Patterson and l are both
up for the same job - senior analyst.

348
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:16,873
l want that job. l want that so bad.

349
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,956
Then drink to it.

350
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:22,276
Make it happen.

351
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:33,556
Make it happen.

352
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:49,917
- Give me that quote on the whole 79.
- (man) l've already told you l could.

353
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:52,873
- You wanna dump the dollars?
- You wanna go to lunch?

354
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,434
l can't. l gotta meet somebody.

355
00:32:55,560 --> 00:33:00,509
Great job on the bimonthly.
When have you had time to sleep?

356
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:04,428
- Pete, l'll call you back.
- Gotta beat the morning trade figure.

357
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:07,916
l know. l know. l know. l'll call you back.

358
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:18,072
Hi, Alex. Sorry l'm late.
Listen, just leave them under the seats.

359
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:21,033
Sure you can't go? Beautiful day.

360
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:23,958
Track? l really can't
play the ponies right now.

361
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:26,799
- You're uptight.
- lt's work.

362
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:29,829
Wanna tell me about it?

363
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:34,750
lt's a matter of timing. The trade figure
comes out at 5.30 tomorrow morning.

364
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:37,030
lt's going to be significantly up.

365
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:40,596
- How do you know?
- l just know. l feel it. lt's my job to know.

366
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:43,154
l should dump dollars
before New York closes,

367
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:47,319
but company policy dictates that l can't
until after the trade figure is out.

368
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:49,192
What if you do it before?

369
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:53,199
lf l'm right, l'm ahead of everybody,
the client cleans up.

370
00:33:53,320 --> 00:33:57,233
So you can make 'em money.
lt's not illegal. What's the problem?

371
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:59,999
lt's a question of judicious business.

372
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:02,839
lt's not a question of judicious business.

373
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:05,952
- lt's a question of balls.
- (winces)

374
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:09,231
Do you have the cojones or don't you?

375
00:34:11,240 --> 00:34:16,439
- Spent all night doing the report. l'm tired.
- Good morning, Michael.

376
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:50,439
- (Leslie over intercom) You in already?
- Yeah.

377
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:53,870
- A Mr Cojones for you on line three.
- Hello.

378
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,195
- (Alex) Morning.
- You up already?

379
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:59,232
l haven't gone to bed yet.
Well, how'd you do?

380
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:03,478
- l was right. Up by almost a 30% pop.
- Great! Let's celebrate.

381
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:08,993
l can't. l gotta go to Ruth's parents' house
for dinner - anniversary party. Very formal.

382
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:13,318
- Sounds like a riot.
- l can't not go. Dr Fielding'd be crushed.

383
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:17,877
- Suit yourself. Hey, nice work, Mick.
- Thank you.

384
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:22,198
Michael, don't forget about the DMV
to get your new driver's licence at nine.

385
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:26,233
And also you've got
just a stack of messages from yesterday.

386
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:29,875
l'm just gonna get a cup of coffee.
l'll just be at my desk.

387
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,149
- Leslie?
- Yes, sir.

388
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:33,555
Call me Mick.

389
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:35,671
Mick.

390
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:41,158
Patterson here. You're kidding.
When did those figures come in?

391
00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:46,912
Howard?

392
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:49,517
Hold on for a second.

393
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:51,073
Good news.

394

396
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:20,675
- Thanks, Daddy.
- Terrific.

397
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:29,554

398
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:31,238
Yeah.

399
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:34,238
lt's a little greasy, but nice.

400
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:36,635
- l'm late. Sorry.
- Everything OK at work?

401
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:39,115
- Couldn't be better.
- Your friend is here.

402
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:41,196
My friend?

403
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:47,076
- Michael! There you are, dear.
- Happy anniversary. This is for you.

404
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:50,158

- François?

405
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:54,354
Bonsoir, Michel.

406
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:56,038
François, you made it.

407
00:36:56,160 --> 00:37:00,233
Oui. l could not let you
celebrate without me.

408
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:02,078
- Of course not. No.
- Michael.

409
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:05,112
- Dr Fielding, congratulations.

- Guess l'll come to these things for you.
- l guess.

411
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:12,153
- You work with someone from Paris?
- Yes, yes. We've been, uh...

412
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:15,033
- l 'ave been 'ere for several weeks.
- Yeah.

413
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:20,359
We were about to look at the promotional
campaign you and François put together.

414
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:25,838
Pardon, but Mick and l have seen
this promotion a thousand times. Mick?

415
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:29,555
- He's charming.
- Yes, he is, isn't he? François?

416
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:35,836

- l'm not mad...
- You might be in a minute.

418
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:42,598
- l just want you to know l did this for you.
- Did what for me?

419
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:44,676
Did what for me?

420
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:51,670

- No, she's not even my wife.

443
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:53,990
You should be angry.

444
00:39:54,120 --> 00:39:56,588
Angry is boring.

445
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:58,676
l don't feel like it.

446
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:00,756

00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:36,956
One thing's for sure,
never get what you're asking

502
00:45:37,080 --> 00:45:40,516
They come with johnsons,
they come with knives

503
00:45:40,640 --> 00:45:45,839
They're robbing your boots
when they're giving you a shine

504
00:45:45,960 --> 00:45:49,396
l wanna take you down

505
00:45:49,520 --> 00:45:53,832
l wanna take you right down

506
00:45:53,960 --> 00:45:56,713
l

507
00:45:56,840 --> 00:45:59,877
l wanna take you down

508
00:46:00,120 --> 00:46:03,157
l wanna take you down

509
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:10,197
l wanna take you right downtown

510
00:46:11,080 --> 00:46:13,389
Hey! Don't fade on me now.

511
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:17,035
- l'm all right. l just wanna sleep a second.
- Come on.

512
00:46:33,840 --> 00:46:36,070
Levering.

513
00:46:36,200 --> 00:46:39,795
This is Patterson's neighbourhood.
That's his street.

514
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:42,354
- Really?
- Let's turn around.

515
00:46:47,240 --> 00:46:49,151
Pull a U-ie right here.

516
00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:01,030
l have to go to work.

517
00:48:03,600 --> 00:48:06,114
You don't mind if l sleep here, do you?

518
00:48:13,280 --> 00:48:15,236
Just lock up when you go.

519
00:48:16,840 --> 00:48:19,912
You were somethin' last night, Mick.

520
00:48:21,040 --> 00:48:22,996
A changed man.

521
00:48:26,720 --> 00:48:27,869
(door opens)

522
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,833
- Give my regards to Patterson.
- (door shuts)

523
00:48:39,280 --> 00:48:41,475
- Mr Boll!
- Rito.

524
00:48:41,600 --> 00:48:43,352
- Aced it.
- What?

525
00:48:43,480 --> 00:48:48,031
My accounting test.
Third highest in my class.

526
00:48:48,440 --> 00:48:50,874
- Thanks for your help.
- Sure.

527
00:48:53,440 --> 00:48:56,079
- Hey, Michael... Mick.
- Morning.

528
00:48:56,200 --> 00:49:00,557
- That is so awful.
- The city is getting just ridiculous.

529
00:49:00,680 --> 00:49:03,399
- Where's the sugar?
- lt's right here.

530
00:49:03,520 --> 00:49:07,798
- Hear what happened to Patterson?
- He got mugged last night. Assaulted.

531
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:11,356
- Can you believe it?
- Gross. What happened to your hand?

532
00:49:11,480 --> 00:49:14,836
- Nothing. No, well, l hurt it.
- Are you OK?

533
00:49:15,960 --> 00:49:18,474
l'm fi... Yeah, l'm fine.

534
00:49:18,600 --> 00:49:21,239
Where did it happen?

535
00:49:21,360 --> 00:49:22,918
l'm not sure.

536
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:27,434
Do they know who did it?

537
00:49:27,560 --> 00:49:30,552
l don't know.
He didn't seem to wanna go into it.

538
00:49:30,680 --> 00:49:35,390
- He's OK though?
- l think so. He was beaten up pretty badly.

539
00:49:37,040 --> 00:49:43,070
lmagine that. That is the very thing that
makes me wanna... move back to Seattle.

540
00:49:43,920 --> 00:49:46,559
- (door opens)
- (Michael) Alex?

541
00:49:50,480 --> 00:49:53,313
What happened last night?

542
00:49:53,440 --> 00:49:55,396
What do you mean?

543
00:49:57,320 --> 00:50:00,198
Last l remember
we were in Patterson's neighbourhood,

544
00:50:00,320 --> 00:50:04,871
and l go into the office today
and find out he got beat up.

545
00:50:05,800 --> 00:50:11,238
And l'm standing there in the middle of
everybody with dried blood over my hand.

546
00:50:11,360 --> 00:50:13,954
Did we go to Patterson's last night?

547
00:50:14,080 --> 00:50:16,992
Yes. We went to Patterson's.

548
00:50:19,680 --> 00:50:22,319
l mean, l didn't hit him, did l?

549
00:50:22,440 --> 00:50:25,000
You didn't just hit him.

550
00:50:25,120 --> 00:50:27,350
You beat the shit out of him.

551
00:50:34,080 --> 00:50:36,036
What the hell were you doing?

552
00:50:36,160 --> 00:50:38,116
Holding him down.

553
00:50:44,480 --> 00:50:47,233
Don't worry. l'm not gonna tell anybody.

554
00:50:47,360 --> 00:50:49,316
Tell anybody?!

555
00:50:50,920 --> 00:50:55,152
- Jesus, this guy is a colleague of mine!
- Don't worry about him.

556
00:50:55,280 --> 00:50:57,430
He won't say anything.

557
00:50:57,560 --> 00:51:02,680
- He knows you'd kill him if he did.
- Wait a min... Wait a sec.

558
00:51:02,800 --> 00:51:04,791
- Kill him?
- Yes.

559
00:51:05,640 --> 00:51:08,996
And if you didn't kill him, l would.

560
00:51:11,080 --> 00:51:14,038
l told him that this morning...

561
00:51:14,160 --> 00:51:16,435
when l went to get the doughnuts.

562
00:51:23,400 --> 00:51:25,356
Get out.

563
00:51:29,360 --> 00:51:31,316
Get out!

564
00:51:33,560 --> 00:51:35,437
OK.

565
00:51:43,280 --> 00:51:45,236
You got what you wanted.

566
00:51:53,280 --> 00:51:56,716
Mick, Howard wants to see you
in his office right away.

567
00:51:56,840 --> 00:52:00,230
- Did he say what it was about?
- No. He just said right away.

568
00:52:04,160 --> 00:52:06,196
- l heard you.
- Sorry.

569
00:52:11,160 --> 00:52:13,515
Sit down, sit down, sit down.

570
00:52:18,160 --> 00:52:20,958
l just got off the phone with Patterson.

571
00:52:22,120 --> 00:52:23,872
Oh?

572
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:27,959
He's withdrawing himself
from consideration for senior analyst.

573
00:52:28,080 --> 00:52:29,832
Yes?

574
00:52:29,960 --> 00:52:32,474
He says he doesn't want the pressure.

575
00:52:32,600 --> 00:52:37,196
Personally, l think he's overreacting
to what happened to him last night.

576
00:52:37,320 --> 00:52:39,709
Yeah. l heard about that.

577
00:52:40,760 --> 00:52:44,719
lf Patterson's out, that makes you
far and away the leading contender.

578
00:52:44,840 --> 00:52:47,195
l just wanted to let you know.

579
00:52:50,920 --> 00:52:54,595
Thank you. That's good to hear.

580
00:52:54,720 --> 00:53:00,272
- You don't seem very pleased about this.
- No, no, l'm... l'm very pleased about it.

581
00:53:00,400 --> 00:53:03,870
l'm sorry that it happened this way.

582
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:09,950
Don't let it obscure the fact you've worked
very hard for this and certainly deserve it.

583
00:53:14,080 --> 00:53:15,354
(elevator bell)

584
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:19,472
Hi, Mike.
Love to see it when you're finished.

585
00:53:19,600 --> 00:53:24,435
- Finished?
- When you're finished with redecorating.

586
00:54:07,840 --> 00:54:09,592
- ls Alex upstairs?
- Who?

587
00:54:09,720 --> 00:54:13,554
- Tony, whoever. The guy staying upstairs.
- Oh, re-upped.

588
00:54:13,680 --> 00:54:15,671
- What?
- Re-enlisted in the navy.

589
00:54:15,800 --> 00:54:18,553
He and my brother were shipmates.

590
00:54:21,280 --> 00:54:24,829
- That son of a bitch.
- Hey, watch your fuckin' mouth, man.

591
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:27,394
Tony, he's a hell of a guy.

592
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:33,878
Do you know why l took your stuff?

593
00:54:34,800 --> 00:54:38,270
To show you l could.
Put things back in perspective for you.

594
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:41,710
What kind of game are you playing
with my life? This is my life!

595
00:54:41,840 --> 00:54:46,516
- l'm going to the police.
- What are you gonna tell 'em?

596
00:54:46,640 --> 00:54:51,873
That some guy you knocked over
a hamburger joint with stole all your stuff?

597
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:53,956
l just want it back.

598
00:54:56,560 --> 00:54:58,118
lt's mine.

599
00:54:59,200 --> 00:55:01,760
Like your promotion is.

600
00:55:01,880 --> 00:55:03,836
Like Claire is.

601
00:55:04,840 --> 00:55:09,868
Do you think you would've gotten
any of it if it weren't for me?

602
00:55:16,480 --> 00:55:18,835
Keep it.

603
00:55:18,960 --> 00:55:20,916
Keep the stuff.

604
00:55:22,240 --> 00:55:27,360
- So the stuff makes us even.
- Yeah, the stuff makes us even.

605
00:55:30,080 --> 00:55:31,832
Huh.

606
00:55:41,200 --> 00:55:42,952
- Oh, hi.
- Hi.

607
00:55:45,080 --> 00:55:47,913
- Why do you wanna stay?
- Would you rather l not, cos...

608
00:55:48,040 --> 00:55:51,999
No, that's fine. l was just wondering
what was wrong with your place.

609
00:55:52,120 --> 00:55:54,634
- Nothing.
- Oh.

610
00:55:54,760 --> 00:55:56,716
Come on.

611
00:56:04,240 --> 00:56:08,552
- Morning. Any messages for me?
- Here you go, Mr Patterson.

612
00:56:08,680 --> 00:56:10,636
Thanks, Kelly.

613
00:56:15,840 --> 00:56:19,150
Mick, there's a call for you on line one.
She says it's urgent.

614
00:56:19,280 --> 00:56:22,317
- Who said it's urgent?
- l don't know. She wouldn't say.

615
00:56:22,440 --> 00:56:24,192
All right. Thank you.

616
00:56:24,320 --> 00:56:26,470
Take a look at this, Carol.

617
00:56:31,720 --> 00:56:34,712
- Hello.
- (Alex, in a female voice) Hi, sweetheart.

618
00:56:34,840 --> 00:56:38,150
- Don't pretend you don't remember me.
- What do you want?

619
00:56:38,280 --> 00:56:41,511
- (own voice) l'm doing you a favour.
- l don't want a favour.

620
00:56:41,640 --> 00:56:44,473
l did what you said.
Your stuff's gone. l sold it.

621
00:56:44,600 --> 00:56:49,515
But there's a lot of shit that's no good
to anybody - discs, pictures, passport.

622
00:56:49,640 --> 00:56:52,154
- Do you want it?
- Yes, that would be a good idea.

623
00:56:52,280 --> 00:56:53,633
Great.

624
00:56:53,760 --> 00:56:59,869
You know the oil fields off La Cienega?
Your stuff's in a box by well number 43.

625
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:01,831
That's not convenient.

626
00:57:01,960 --> 00:57:04,633
Take it or leave it.
lt's on my way outta town.

627
00:57:04,760 --> 00:57:06,796
You won't see me any more.

628
00:57:06,920 --> 00:57:09,639
- Oh, your wallet's there, too.
- My wallet?

629
00:57:09,760 --> 00:57:12,911
Yeah. You left it on the bar
at the beach. Remember?

630
00:57:13,040 --> 00:57:16,874
l think your Diners Club card's
over the limit, though.

631
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:19,070
Adios, Mick.

632
00:57:23,840 --> 00:57:26,559
l've gotta go someplace. l'm sorry.

633
00:57:26,680 --> 00:57:28,875
Can we pick this up in the morning?

634
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:31,355
- Sure.
- Great.

635
00:57:31,480 --> 00:57:33,869
- Everything OK?
- Yeah. Leslie, help Carol.

636
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:37,117
- Where shall l say you went?
- Don't.

637
00:57:37,240 --> 00:57:39,196
Sorry l asked.

638
00:59:39,200 --> 00:59:41,156
Hi, pal.

639
00:59:42,160 --> 00:59:45,277
l want you to remember one thing.

640
00:59:45,400 --> 00:59:47,595
You asked for this.

641
00:59:47,720 --> 00:59:49,676
(knock at door)

642
00:59:54,840 --> 00:59:57,195
Don't touch that dial.

643
01:00:06,960 --> 01:00:09,599
- Well, hello. ls he here?
- Yeah.

644
01:00:10,600 --> 01:00:13,194
Where's all his stuff?. ls he moving?

645
01:00:14,240 --> 01:00:16,390
(Alex) Uh, well...

646
01:00:17,720 --> 01:00:19,711
- Yeah, sort of.
- Where is he?

647
01:00:19,840 --> 01:00:22,752
- He's in the bedroom.
- Good. l wanna talk to him.

648
01:00:22,880 --> 01:00:25,838
Great. Come on down!

649
01:00:33,240 --> 01:00:35,356
So where is he?

650
01:00:35,480 --> 01:00:37,436
Quit fooling around.

651
01:00:40,680 --> 01:00:44,434
- (Alex) Mind if l play through?
- Where is he? What are you doin'?

652
01:00:44,560 --> 01:00:46,516
- (Alex) Fore!
- Argh!

653
01:02:07,480 --> 01:02:11,996
(recites ''Hail Mary'')

654
01:02:20,360 --> 01:02:22,112
(whistling)

655
01:02:33,120 --> 01:02:35,680
You thought we were even before.

656
01:02:35,800 --> 01:02:38,268
Now we're even.

657
01:02:38,400 --> 01:02:42,678
Before you do anything stupid like
go to the police, l'd think it through,

658
01:02:42,800 --> 01:02:45,360
cos l've covered all the bases.

659
01:03:06,160 --> 01:03:09,038
Elvis has left the building!

660
01:03:23,560 --> 01:03:25,516
(knock at door)

661
01:03:25,640 --> 01:03:27,790
(Pismo) Michael, it's me.

662
01:03:28,760 --> 01:03:30,716
(knocks again)

663
01:03:32,760 --> 01:03:34,716
Open the door.

664
01:03:37,840 --> 01:03:39,637
Michael!

665
01:03:39,760 --> 01:03:42,752
What's going on?
l thought you didn't wanna come here.

666
01:03:42,880 --> 01:03:45,155
- Go away.
- Michael!

667
01:03:45,880 --> 01:03:48,917
Michael! Come on!

668
01:03:49,040 --> 01:03:50,996
- Michael.
- Shit!

669
01:03:58,040 --> 01:04:00,270
Could you please stop that?

670
01:04:01,680 --> 01:04:06,196
lt's just a matter of time. Get in bed with
the devil, sooner or later you have to fuck.

671
01:04:06,320 --> 01:04:10,518
He did it in my apartment
with my golf club.

672
01:04:10,640 --> 01:04:15,873
l run out of my office after getting
some call from some... woman.

673
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:18,116
He's got my jacket. My jacket.

674
01:04:18,920 --> 01:04:22,469
- lf l call the police, my jacket shows up...
- l can't be in this.

675
01:04:22,600 --> 01:04:26,354
Blood all over it in my car,
or in some Dumpster, or in my office.

676
01:04:26,480 --> 01:04:32,237
Cops won't believe this guy even exists.
Don't go to them. Promise me you won't.

677
01:04:32,360 --> 01:04:33,952
l need to smoke.

678
01:04:34,080 --> 01:04:36,230
l need your help.

679
01:05:09,800 --> 01:05:13,031
We have to take your car.
Mine's too small.

680
01:05:13,160 --> 01:05:16,072
lf anything happens, if the cops find out...

681
01:05:17,080 --> 01:05:20,117
l can't promise what l'll do.

682
01:05:20,240 --> 01:05:22,470
l don't wanna let you down.

683
01:05:30,640 --> 01:05:32,596
(elevator bell)

684
01:06:01,920 --> 01:06:04,275
What if somebody gets on?

685
01:06:21,720 --> 01:06:23,995
Let's put it down here.

686
01:06:24,120 --> 01:06:27,590
OK. Go get the car and bring it around.

687
01:06:27,720 --> 01:06:30,280
The keys! l left 'em upstairs.

688
01:06:30,400 --> 01:06:33,073
- l was distracted, OK?
- Just hurry.

689
01:06:33,200 --> 01:06:35,156
- Uh-huh.
- Hurry!

690
01:06:40,200 --> 01:06:42,156
(angry voices)

691
01:06:47,320 --> 01:06:50,596
(man) l told you, l did not fuck her!

692
01:06:50,720 --> 01:06:53,553
(woman) You took her out.
To me, that's fucking.

693
01:06:53,680 --> 01:06:57,593
OK. l fucked her once.

694
01:06:57,720 --> 01:07:00,871
- Did you like it?
- Goddammit! Shut up.

695
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:03,116
- l'm sick of it! Every week!
- How was it?

696
01:07:03,240 --> 01:07:05,993
- What?
- Was she good?

697
01:07:06,120 --> 01:07:08,588
- (man) l don't wanna hear it.
- Wait a minute.

698
01:07:08,720 --> 01:07:11,473
- (man) Just forget it, OK?
- Wait!

699
01:07:12,360 --> 01:07:15,397
- Where do you think you're going?
- That's the end of it.

700
01:07:15,520 --> 01:07:18,353
- (woman) Come back.
- Not until you start trusting me.

701
01:07:18,480 --> 01:07:21,040
Trust you!
You just admitted you fucked her.

702
01:07:21,160 --> 01:07:25,358
Yeah, but you wouldn't even know that
if l hadn't told you.

703
01:07:35,680 --> 01:07:38,831
Get lost! You and your stupid dog.

704
01:07:48,760 --> 01:07:50,512
Pismo.

705
01:07:50,640 --> 01:07:52,198
Over here.

706
01:08:57,120 --> 01:08:58,269
(knock at door)

707
01:08:58,400 --> 01:08:59,753
Yeah?

708
01:09:02,280 --> 01:09:04,999
- What's this?
- lt's my transfer.

709
01:09:05,120 --> 01:09:10,114
- Your what?
- Transfer! l'm going to Financial Services.

710
01:09:10,240 --> 01:09:12,515
- Why?
- Why don't you tell me, Mick?

711
01:09:12,640 --> 01:09:16,394
Something is obviously wrong.
Something has been wrong.

712
01:09:16,520 --> 01:09:22,072
You haven't even spoken to me in days.
And l can't handle it. l'm sorry.

713
01:09:22,200 --> 01:09:25,749
- Leslie, wait. Let's talk about this.
- What?

714
01:09:26,760 --> 01:09:28,876
What?

715
01:09:30,240 --> 01:09:32,231
What?!

716
01:09:32,360 --> 01:09:33,918
What?

717
01:09:34,040 --> 01:09:35,792
lt's noth... it's nothing.

718
01:09:35,920 --> 01:09:38,673
All right. See ya later, Mick.

719
01:09:52,840 --> 01:09:56,469
lt means he followed us.
He knows where we put the body.

720
01:09:56,600 --> 01:09:59,114
- He followed us the whole time?
- Right.

721
01:09:59,240 --> 01:10:02,038
- So he's seen me. He knows where l live!
- (siren)

722
01:10:02,160 --> 01:10:04,435
l can't be in this.

723
01:10:04,560 --> 01:10:06,710
What are we gonna do?

724
01:10:14,800 --> 01:10:17,792
- Michael?
- l've gotta call you right back.

725
01:11:20,240 --> 01:11:22,754
This is what he does - watch me squirm.

726
01:11:22,880 --> 01:11:27,192
And if l'm not squirming enough,
he gives me another jab.

727
01:11:27,320 --> 01:11:31,472
l cannot go back to jail.
l'll die there, l swear to God.

728
01:11:31,600 --> 01:11:33,556
l'm gonna fucking hang!

729
01:11:35,720 --> 01:11:39,679
And there's not a goddamn thing
l can do about it.

730
01:11:45,600 --> 01:11:47,909
Unless l kill the son of a bitch.

731
01:11:49,160 --> 01:11:52,994
Of course, l can't kill the son of a bitch
unless l know where he is.

732
01:11:53,120 --> 01:11:55,554
Now you're thinking like him.

733
01:12:00,400 --> 01:12:03,278
Do you have a copy of The Reader?

734
01:12:03,400 --> 01:12:07,154
- Do you? Where?
- Yeah. Here.

735
01:12:07,680 --> 01:12:10,831
- l know how to find the son of a bitch.
- No, Michael!

736
01:12:10,960 --> 01:12:14,350
The police have a file on me.
They've gotta have a file on this guy.

737
01:12:14,480 --> 01:12:16,675
We just have to get his fingerprints.

738
01:12:28,640 --> 01:12:31,234
- You'll have to wait here. You know that?
- Yes.

739
01:12:31,360 --> 01:12:34,955
- lf he sees you, everything is fucked.
- Yeah, l know.

740
01:12:35,080 --> 01:12:38,834
So you'll wait here
while l try to get his prints?

741
01:12:38,960 --> 01:12:40,712
Yeah.

742
01:13:23,160 --> 01:13:27,278
- ''Fun-loving couple seeks petite...''
- You got it.

743
01:13:32,840 --> 01:13:35,798
( ''Look Who's Sorry Now''
by Skinny Puppy)

744
01:16:43,840 --> 01:16:45,990
Buenas noches, Victor.

745
01:16:54,360 --> 01:16:56,112
l feel funny about this, Mr Boll.

746
01:16:56,240 --> 01:16:59,994
l'll get it back to you Monday morning,
as soon as l make the deposit.

747
01:17:00,120 --> 01:17:01,872
l don't know.

748
01:17:02,640 --> 01:17:06,758
l'm sitting on $40,000 cash
for the weekend.

749
01:17:06,880 --> 01:17:08,677
l just don't feel safe.

750
01:17:08,800 --> 01:17:13,999
l would never ask, except l'm stuck.
l don't have anybody else l can go to.

751
01:17:14,120 --> 01:17:17,192
lf it was anybody else but you...

752
01:17:17,320 --> 01:17:19,276
Thank you.

753
01:17:22,960 --> 01:17:24,951
- Be careful, OK?
- Absolutely.

754
01:18:21,120 --> 01:18:22,599
Michael?

755
01:19:29,240 --> 01:19:31,231
Agh! Agh!

756
01:19:35,960 --> 01:19:37,598
Help!

757
01:19:37,840 --> 01:19:38,829
Help!

758
01:19:38,960 --> 01:19:41,235
Michael! Help!

759
01:19:41,360 --> 01:19:42,998
Help!

760
01:19:43,120 --> 01:19:44,394
Michael!

761
01:19:44,640 --> 01:19:46,790
Michael!

762
01:19:46,920 --> 01:19:48,478
Help!

763
01:19:48,600 --> 01:19:50,955
- Hold on.
- Help!

764
01:20:07,560 --> 01:20:09,437
Pismo, what happened?

765
01:20:09,560 --> 01:20:12,711
- He's here. He tried to kill me.
- Wait.

766
01:20:37,320 --> 01:20:38,878
Pismo?

767
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:41,833
l can't find him any more.
What happened?

768
01:20:41,960 --> 01:20:45,669
OK, l got the address of his friend.

769
01:20:45,800 --> 01:20:48,394
Manhattan Beach.

770
01:20:48,520 --> 01:20:51,671
That's where l met him.
That's where he's staying.

771
01:20:51,800 --> 01:20:53,756
Hey, wait.

772
01:20:57,600 --> 01:21:01,957
Michael! Would you wait up a minute?

773
01:21:02,080 --> 01:21:04,036
- Michael!
- l do not want you with me.

774
01:21:04,160 --> 01:21:07,869
- What is this? Where did you get that?
- Go upstairs and go to bed!

775
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:09,752
What are you gonna do?

776
01:21:09,880 --> 01:21:11,836
Michael, wait!

777
01:21:13,680 --> 01:21:16,478
- Would you stop for a second?
- Go back inside.

778
01:21:16,600 --> 01:21:18,238
Give me the gun.

779
01:21:18,360 --> 01:21:21,557
Don't fuck with me.
You don't know me any more.

780
01:21:21,680 --> 01:21:24,194
Yes, l do. Give it to me
before you hurt somebody.

781
01:21:24,320 --> 01:21:26,276
Fine. Take it.

782
01:21:31,280 --> 01:21:35,159
Stop! Do not step on the brake!

783
01:22:17,960 --> 01:22:19,916
Go touch the pedal.

784
01:22:32,240 --> 01:22:34,435
- Let me help you.
- You can't help.

785
01:22:34,560 --> 01:22:38,394
Michael, please.
lf you do this, he really has won.

786
01:22:43,920 --> 01:22:45,876
(wind chimes)

787
01:23:44,120 --> 01:23:45,678
Oh!

788
01:24:54,280 --> 01:24:56,396
Me. l'm next.

789
01:24:57,120 --> 01:25:00,351
- l'm gonna get us something to drink.
- OK.

790
01:25:00,480 --> 01:25:02,436
Be right back.

791
01:25:21,080 --> 01:25:23,036
(wind chimes)

792
01:26:16,680 --> 01:26:20,753
You make a very funny face when
you come. Anyone ever tell you that?

793
01:26:20,880 --> 01:26:24,156
- Are you going someplace?
- (groans)

794
01:26:24,280 --> 01:26:26,236
What's that?

795
01:26:27,800 --> 01:26:30,189
Oh. My jacket.

796
01:26:30,320 --> 01:26:33,710
Where were you gonna plant it?
ln the Dumpster at my office?

797
01:26:33,840 --> 01:26:35,910
- Your apartment.
- Oh.

798
01:26:36,040 --> 01:26:39,077
Under the Dumpster, actually.

799
01:26:39,200 --> 01:26:41,475
Drop it.

800
01:26:42,960 --> 01:26:44,837
You and l need to talk.

801
01:26:44,960 --> 01:26:46,632
No. No.

802
01:26:46,760 --> 01:26:48,239
No talking.

803
01:26:48,360 --> 01:26:50,794
You're gonna die with your mouth shut.

804
01:26:52,440 --> 01:26:54,237
Then do it.

805
01:26:56,560 --> 01:26:59,711
You can't, cos l never showed you how.

806
01:27:05,360 --> 01:27:07,396
Now l'm gonna show you.

807
01:27:45,160 --> 01:27:47,116
Oh, shit!

808
01:27:52,520 --> 01:27:54,715
Guess l got you now, Mick.

809
01:27:54,840 --> 01:27:56,592
Hah!

810
01:27:59,760 --> 01:28:02,228
Fuck you.

811
01:28:02,360 --> 01:28:04,157
Get back.

812
01:28:04,280 --> 01:28:05,952
l said get back!

813
01:28:15,280 --> 01:28:17,510
Drop the knife in the water.

814
01:28:18,600 --> 01:28:20,556
What is this?

815
01:28:21,960 --> 01:28:24,952
lf you were gonna kill me,
you would have at the house.

816
01:28:25,080 --> 01:28:27,389
l said drop the knife in the water.

817
01:28:28,400 --> 01:28:30,868
You're not gonna use that.

818
01:28:41,400 --> 01:28:42,753
l'm sorry.

819
01:28:44,160 --> 01:28:46,230
What?

820
01:28:46,800 --> 01:28:48,552
l'm sorry.

821
01:28:49,040 --> 01:28:51,759
Sorry? You fuck, you.
You're sorry about what?

822
01:28:51,880 --> 01:28:54,872
Killing Claire? Trying to kill my brother?

823
01:28:55,000 --> 01:28:59,152
Or maybe for holding a guy down
while l beat him. Fuck you, you're sorry!

824
01:28:59,280 --> 01:29:02,238
You didn't beat anyone.

825
01:29:02,360 --> 01:29:07,832
l beat Patterson! You were
passed out in the car the whole time!

826
01:29:07,960 --> 01:29:10,997
Knocked your hand on the pavement
to fuck with you.

827
01:29:13,040 --> 01:29:15,235
Fuck with me?

828
01:29:15,360 --> 01:29:19,990
l didn't make you do anything
that wasn't in you already.

829
01:29:26,120 --> 01:29:28,839
People are such hypocrites.

830
01:29:28,960 --> 01:29:35,433
They walk through their whole lives
playing innocent, but they're not innocent.

831
01:29:35,560 --> 01:29:39,030
l showed you that.
That's why l killed Claire, Mick.

832
01:29:42,280 --> 01:29:45,078
My name is Michael.

833
01:29:49,800 --> 01:29:52,394
Did you get that?

834
01:29:52,520 --> 01:29:54,875
Every word.

835
01:29:59,400 --> 01:30:01,038
Oh! Watch out!

836
01:31:03,440 --> 01:31:06,989
l called them.
They'll be here any minute.

837
01:31:13,720 --> 01:31:15,676
Anything?

838
01:31:25,560 --> 01:31:27,676
(sirens)

839
01:31:29,160 --> 01:31:31,515
That was fast.

840
01:31:41,760 --> 01:31:44,194
You can stay here.

841
01:31:49,320 --> 01:31:51,595
What are you going to tell them?

842
01:31:52,840 --> 01:31:55,798
