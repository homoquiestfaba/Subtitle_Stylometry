Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh, here we go!

No, that's the queen, Craig. Just let it go.

00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:27,650
What? Let it go?

00:00:27,730 --> 00:00:30,470
Yes. Let... it... go.

I know you're the queen, but let's try
not to be a drama queen, okay?

30
00:01:57,540 --> 00:02:00,160
What exactly are the northern lights?

31
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:02,447
- Hey, my nose!
- (CHUCKLES)

32
00:02:02,527 --> 00:02:06,430
Everyone knows the northern lights are
the Valkyries moving across the night,

33
00:02:06,510 --> 00:02:09,636
while others say
they're nature's night-light.

34
00:02:10,180 --> 00:02:13,651
SVEN: Wrong again, Kristoff. The northern
lights are the result of collisions

35
00:02:13,731 --> 00:02:16,396
between numerously electrically
charged particles from the sun

36
00:02:16,476 --> 00:02:19,510
entering the Earth's atmosphere.
Everybody get that?

37
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:24,046
Okay. I'm taking away your library card.

38
00:02:28,130 --> 00:02:30,220
So, we need a plan of action.

39
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:35,180
If the northern lights won't come to us,
then we'll go to the northern lights.

40
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:37,140
Let's pack it up and get going.

41
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:39,060
- Go, go, go!
- Where?

42
00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:44,190
To wherever the northern lights come from.
You're "Mr. Mountain Man," you must know.

(SCOFFS)
Mr. Mountain Man was my father, please.

44
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:51,390
Just Mountain Man will do. And I have
no idea where they are. I'm not magic.

45
00:02:51,470 --> 00:02:55,296
Sometimes, you gotta make your own magic.

00:02:58,350 --> 00:03:01,140
I know one person who knows all about magic.

A sister-sister adventure!

Filled with sing-a-longs
and near-death experiences. Hooray!

58
00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:42,280
Okay. Sounds like it'll take
a true mountain man and...

59
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:45,480
since I'm the only one here with a degree
from Mountain Man University,

60
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:47,480
I'll lead the way.

61
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:51,220
(CHANGES VOICE) Nothing's safer than being
alone in the woods with a mountain man.

62
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:55,160
Have he and Sven always had... conversations?

63
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:58,790
Yeah. Started quite a while ago.

64
00:03:58,870 --> 00:04:01,330
Sven, should I have
another piece of carrot cake?

65
00:04:01,410 --> 00:04:03,916
(CHANGES VOICE) Carrot cake is healthy.

66
00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:09,296

everything you need.

- What are these, Anna?
- Uh...

71

Don't worry,
there's always a few extra pieces.

72
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:31,070
So, how many miles does this thing do?

73
00:04:31,150 --> 00:04:33,980
Is it hard to look at the back
of a reindeer all day?

74
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:36,265
This is a hybrid, right?

75
00:04:36,345 --> 00:04:39,527
So, how much reindeer power
does this thing have?

76
00:04:39,607 --> 00:04:41,504
- (SLURPING)
- One.

77
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:45,550
Okay, I've got some ideas for our adventure.

- Actually, I have close to 100 ideas...

Oh, no!

(MUSIC STOPS)

173
00:11:07,850 --> 00:11:11,364
I don't feel like singing right now.
Just not feeling it.

174
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:18,910
Good news!
I think I've solved all our problems.

175
00:11:18,990 --> 00:11:21,550
(FRENCH ACCENT)
Welcome to <i>Château du Kristoff</i>.

176
00:11:21,630 --> 00:11:26,250
(NORMAL VOICE) Complete with a 24-hour
salad buffet and complementary ratatouille.

177
00:11:26,330 --> 00:11:28,720
We can stay here
until the fjord freezes over.

178
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:31,360
Sitting in an ice palace does us no good.

179
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:34,850
- We need to get over there.
- Yeah, but... (SIGHS)

180
00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:37,880
Fine. The birds can use this one.

181

(BIRDS SQUAWKING)

182
00:11:40,770 --> 00:11:43,120
No problem, I'll scout ahead.

183
00:11:43,550 --> 00:11:46,934
Didn't... think... that... through!

184
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:51,950
- Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
- Probably. Not.

185
00:11:52,030 --> 00:11:56,644
- But I'm sure it'll be inventive.
- Oh, it is. You're gonna love it!

186
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,290
Wow! Impressive redesign.

187
00:12:04,370 --> 00:12:09,024
But, uh... how do you expect
to go anywhere without a motor?

188
00:12:19,850 --> 00:12:23,504
I've never felt so close to nature before.

189
00:12:25,771 --> 00:12:27,820
(LAUGHS)

190
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:32,650
It's nice to have this adventure with you,
Elsa. Just like when we were little.

191
00:12:32,730 --> 00:12:36,384
And now we're big.
We can have bigger adventures.

192
00:12:37,970 --> 00:12:40,160
I think we're close.

193
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:42,293
(GRUNTS)

194
00:12:42,523 --> 00:12:45,124
Yup, we're pretty close. (LAUGHING)

195
00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:52,970
- Wow! Look!
- (GASPS) The northern lights?

196
00:12:53,450 --> 00:12:57,030
No. Another incredibly difficult obstacle.
(LAUGHING)

197
00:12:57,290 --> 00:13:00,670
Looks like we're gonna have
to do some climbing. Okay.

198
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:05,190
So, we can make our way up this crevasse,
then transition farther up the glacier.

199
00:13:05,270 --> 00:13:08,360
We don't even have climbing gear,
feisty boots.

200
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:12,830
And if you think there's a store within
50 miles of here, you're going cuckoo.

201
00:13:12,910 --> 00:13:16,400
Yoo-hoo! Did I hear somebody
needs some climbing gear?

202
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:17,850
Seriously?

203
00:13:17,930 --> 00:13:22,451
So, you're the first customers here
in my new store. (CHUCKLES LIGHTLY)

204
00:13:22,531 --> 00:13:26,820
- Sauna?
- I feel like letting off a little steam.

205
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:29,140
(GASPS) Olaf, don't. Bad idea!

206
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:33,004
But it's so... warm.

(SHOUTING)

208

Big sale on frozen goods.

209
00:13:37,050 --> 00:13:40,740
Tasty snow cone or fish sticks. Or ice cubes.

210
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:43,810
In this cold?
Who in their right mind would want...

211
00:13:43,890 --> 00:13:47,550
Oh, snow cones!
Look at the pretty little colors.

212
00:13:47,630 --> 00:13:51,150
Blue, green... ooh, yellow.

213
00:13:51,230 --> 00:13:53,720
Yellow... wait, yellow snow!

214
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:56,644
Oh, no! No!

215
00:13:58,390 --> 00:14:01,830
Going to see the lights, yeah.
I got the climbing gear you need.

216
00:14:01,910 --> 00:14:07,050
Big winter blowout. Still, a bit pricey.
You know, supply and demand.

217
00:14:07,230 --> 00:14:12,090
Pricey, eh? Look, pal,
you can't just jack up your prices...

- A bit too cool, actually.

00:14:41,060 --> 00:14:45,650
Whew! That... was quite the climb.

227
00:14:45,730 --> 00:14:49,158
You know something,
it really didn't feel that bad.

(GASPS)

229
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:53,730
The northern lights! Aren't they beautiful?

230
00:14:53,810 --> 00:14:56,054
Wow!

231
00:14:56,380 --> 00:14:58,930
They look tiny.

232
00:14:59,310 --> 00:15:02,000
Maybe I need to get my eyes checked, huh?

233
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:04,894
Ooh. No, now they're tinier.

234
00:15:06,390 --> 00:15:09,063
Oh, pretty!

235
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:12,844
But why are they here
and not over our kingdom?

236
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:16,444

00:15:21,770 --> 00:15:23,867

Kristoff, hold on! Elsa, can you do anything?

240
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:39,740
You, again. We have to find a name for you.

241
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:41,804
Ouch!

242
00:15:42,060 --> 00:15:44,704
Not helping.

243
00:15:44,990 --> 00:15:47,774
- Ooh, frozen carrots.
- Mm!

Okay, really not helping.

00:15:54,970 --> 00:15:57,660
I know. I'm trying!

247
00:15:57,740 --> 00:16:01,954
But I'm just worried about the northern
lights and the kingdom, the past.

248
00:16:05,125 --> 00:16:07,064
So cold.

249
00:16:07,250 --> 00:16:10,000
Elsa, the past is in the past.

250
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:14,010
My powers are all out of whack.
It makes me so distraught.

251
00:16:14,090 --> 00:16:19,004
- Oh, what can I do? What can I do?
- You can just let it go.

253
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:24,650
Slipping, still slipping.

254
00:16:24,730 --> 00:16:26,920
You guys, still slipp... ah!

255
00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:30,260
That's the sound
of a mountain man in distress.

256
00:16:30,340 --> 00:16:33,900
- But you promised me pancakes!
- Ah, we promise a lot.

257
00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:37,000
- And syrup!
- Yeah. Let's ride!

258
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:44,640
Hang on there, Sven, you're doing great!

259
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:47,140
I second that, hang on!

260
00:16:47,420 --> 00:16:49,710
I wish I had a tongue like that.

261
00:16:49,790 --> 00:16:51,380
I wish I had a tongue.

- Anna!
- Kristoff!

Uh, you guys do realize you're only,
like, three feet apart, right?

Well, yeah, okay.
But how are we gonna save them?

267
00:17:09,580 --> 00:17:13,724
Stretching, stretching. Really stretching!

We have this question
about the northern lights.

273
00:17:32,730 --> 00:17:34,820
- Not now.
- Huh?

274
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:37,790
Now, we must... (STRAINING) pull.

275
00:17:37,870 --> 00:17:39,924
- Oh, right.

276

Whew!

278
00:17:52,190 --> 00:17:54,710
Wow, I guess I didn't know my own strength.

279
00:17:54,790 --> 00:17:57,550
And they call me twig arms.

280
00:17:57,630 --> 00:17:59,350
Technically that is true.

281
00:17:59,430 --> 00:18:03,644
Grand Pabbie, we finally found you!

282
00:18:04,470 --> 00:18:09,430
- What are you doing up here?
- Something very important.

283
00:18:09,740 --> 00:18:12,390
Please tell me you brought your crystals?

284
00:18:12,470 --> 00:18:17,841
Right, crystals. Uh, I am definitely
pretty mostly sure I brought those.

285
00:18:17,921 --> 00:18:20,470
I think I stuck them in...
Yes! Oh, yes, we have them.

286
00:18:20,550 --> 00:18:22,587
Oh, those things.

287
00:18:22,667 --> 00:18:23,843
GRAND PABBIE: Good.

288
00:18:23,923 --> 00:18:28,810
Every 500 years I must come here
to where the earth touches the sky.

289
00:18:29,157 --> 00:18:33,180
Then, yadda-yadda-yadda,
mystical stuff happens and voila,

290
00:18:33,260 --> 00:18:36,144
northern lights.

291
00:18:37,670 --> 00:18:39,550
Enjoy!

292
00:18:39,830 --> 00:18:44,690
The four crystals will refract
the light to each corner of Arendelle.

293
00:18:44,770 --> 00:18:47,154
Don't worry.

294
00:18:48,566 --> 00:18:50,870
- (LAUGHS) Oh, we weren't worried.
- Hm.

295
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:53,162
Okay, we were a little worried.

296
00:18:53,242 --> 00:18:56,763
I'm just so, so happy
to see the northern lights again.

297
00:18:56,843 --> 00:19:00,510
It feels like... the first time in forever.

298
00:19:01,688 --> 00:19:04,210
- (GIGGLES) That sounds familiar.
- (LAUGHTER)

299
00:19:04,290 --> 00:19:06,680
GRAND PABBIE: My job is done.

300
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:10,774
500 years and they almost
didn't bring their crystals.

301
00:19:13,330 --> 00:19:14,720
(MUSIC)

302
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:18,090
All right, all right, everyone.
Party is over.

303
00:19:18,170 --> 00:19:21,264
Oh! Already? Come on!

304
00:19:22,979 --> 00:19:25,480
No! It's early.

00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:40,750
Well, well, well.
Thought we'd never catch ya, huh?

308
00:19:40,830 --> 00:19:41,750
(GASPS)

309
00:19:41,830 --> 00:19:43,855
Wow. Gorgeous. Incredible.

310
00:19:43,935 --> 00:19:47,690
Uh, sir? The... he's, um...

311
00:19:48,470 --> 00:19:51,560
Darn it, Craig, you had one job to do.

312
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:54,030
- One job. One job.
- He was right there.

313
00:19:54,110 --> 00:19:57,454
- I had my arm around him.
- Oh, Craig.

314
00:20:00,950 --> 00:20:03,300
(SIGHS) We had quite the adventure.

315
00:20:03,380 --> 00:20:07,270
I know. I don't think I've ever seen
the northern lights brighter.

316
00:20:07,350 --> 00:20:11,580
I don't think I've ever seen
the northern lights. Wait a second.

317
00:20:11,660 --> 00:20:14,935
Yes, I have! The sky is awake.

318
00:20:15,015 --> 00:20:19,490
The sky is awake. Remember Anna?
That's how we used to call them.

319
00:20:20,670 --> 00:20:24,160
(GASPS) Happy thoughts,
happy thoughts. Puppies, kittens.

320
00:20:24,527 --> 00:20:26,102
(LAUGHS)

321
00:20:26,182 --> 00:20:28,672
Your magic is back.

322
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:34,030
(CHUCKLES) Wow!

323
00:20:34,110 --> 00:20:37,894
We need a place to sit and watch the show.

324
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:43,210
Oh, impressive.

325
00:20:43,290 --> 00:20:46,450
But, ooh, you know,
it's a bit chilly on my buns.

326
00:20:46,530 --> 00:20:49,720
Maybe a cushion made of eagle feathers,
bear claws, and tree fungus.

327
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:53,614
Something with some smelly mountain man musk.

328
00:20:55,670 --> 00:20:56,990
This looks great though.

329
00:20:57,070 --> 00:20:59,360
And tonight, as an added bonus,

330
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:03,300
I get my first frozen hot chocolate.

331
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:06,524
- There you go.
- Mm!

332
00:21:08,001 --> 00:21:09,220
(SIGHS)

333
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:12,684
Like a cup of fresh mountain air.

334
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:16,910
(GRUNTS) And I got to share
all of this with my little sister.

335
00:21:16,990 --> 00:21:19,780
And I got to share it with my big sister.

336
00:21:19,860 --> 00:21:22,874
- Go on, Elsa. Sing it.
