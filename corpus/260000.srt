1
00:00:39,389 --> 00:00:43,826
From the start it was good.
In the beginning, it was really good.

2
00:00:43,993 --> 00:00:46,359
When it first started, we...

3
00:00:46,563 --> 00:00:50,226
First started seeing each other,
going out together...

4
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:52,800
...just the two of us, doing things.

5
00:00:52,969 --> 00:00:56,598
Well, it always is.

6
00:00:56,806 --> 00:01:00,469
- Isn't it always that way?
- Isn't it?

7
00:01:00,677 --> 00:01:05,011
- Christ. The energy we had.
- The fun we had.

8
00:01:05,215 --> 00:01:06,807
The times we spent.

9
00:01:06,983 --> 00:01:09,884
- Doing nothing sometimes.
- Doing everything.

10
00:01:10,053 --> 00:01:12,578
- It didn't matter what we did.
- Anything.

11
00:01:12,789 --> 00:01:15,986
- It was just so good.
- It was like a drug.

12
00:01:16,192 --> 00:01:20,891
Every day, whatever I was doing,
the whole world was beautiful.

13
00:01:21,097 --> 00:01:25,625
Everything that didn't make sense
before, all of a sudden...

14
00:01:25,802 --> 00:01:27,565
It was being alive again.

15
00:01:27,737 --> 00:01:31,798
It was like I'd been dead,
and now I was alive again.

16
00:01:31,975 --> 00:01:35,911
Hope, I guess. That's what it was.

17
00:01:36,112 --> 00:01:38,046
Belief.

18
00:01:38,882 --> 00:01:42,318
Believing in everything
again, you know?

19
00:01:42,519 --> 00:01:46,250
I liked the way I looked.
I stopped checking the scale.

20
00:01:46,422 --> 00:01:51,985
- I stopped smoking. I stopped smoking.
- I stopped punishing myself.

21
00:01:52,195 --> 00:01:57,690
- I felt good about myself.
- I felt like I could do anything.

22
00:01:57,901 --> 00:02:00,631
I used to get so excited
I would shake.

23
00:02:00,837 --> 00:02:04,136
Every time I knew
I was going to see him...

24
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:07,969
...there was, like, this electricity
coming out of me.

25
00:02:08,178 --> 00:02:10,271
You know, people would say:

26
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:14,439
"What's going on? You look great.
What've you been doing?"

27
00:02:14,651 --> 00:02:16,778
- I was on a roll.
- I was strong.

28
00:02:16,986 --> 00:02:20,183
I was relaxed.
I was like a pig in shit.

29
00:02:20,356 --> 00:02:23,985
- Everything came together suddenly.
- All the loose ends.

30
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:28,153
- All the fear. All the anxiety.
- Sometimes...

31
00:02:28,364 --> 00:02:32,061
...you don't even know
you're in pain until it goes away.

32
00:02:32,235 --> 00:02:35,033
- And then the relief.
- The joy.

33
00:02:36,172 --> 00:02:38,663
- When I saw him...
- I laid eyes on her...

34
00:02:38,842 --> 00:02:40,173
- I knew.
- Right away.

35
00:02:40,343 --> 00:02:43,244
- This was it.
- Really it.

36
00:03:17,947 --> 00:03:22,884
When it starts that good,
there's no place to go except bad.

37
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:27,647
- Why be so difficult?
- Because I want to know.

38
00:03:27,824 --> 00:03:29,655
- Bullshit!
- What are we doing?

39
00:03:29,826 --> 00:03:33,819
What we're doing? What you're doing
is leaving, going. Go!

40
00:03:33,997 --> 00:03:36,124
- I'm not going.
- Go.

41
00:03:36,299 --> 00:03:40,030
- We're supposed to be talking.
- We are talking.

42
00:03:40,203 --> 00:03:44,867
- No, we're not talking!
- Okay, then. We'll talk.

43
00:03:45,041 --> 00:03:47,202
We'll talk.

44
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:53,648
Talk. Talk.

45
00:03:54,517 --> 00:03:56,212
Talk!

46
00:03:58,154 --> 00:03:59,678
Go on.

47
00:04:00,623 --> 00:04:05,185
- You really make me sick.
- Thank you very much.

48
00:04:05,395 --> 00:04:09,764
If I eat, I want to throw up.
If I don't eat, I get a headache.

49
00:04:09,933 --> 00:04:14,393
If I sleep, I have nightmares.
If I don't sleep, I get depressed.

50
00:04:14,604 --> 00:04:16,265
I can't move.

51
00:04:16,439 --> 00:04:19,897
I'm stuck on a chair just going over
every word...

52
00:04:20,076 --> 00:04:22,067
...and it makes me even sicker.

53
00:04:22,245 --> 00:04:25,078
- This is a conversation?
- I'm trying!

54
00:04:25,248 --> 00:04:29,116
I have 57 vegetables waiting to have
their picture taken.

55
00:04:29,285 --> 00:04:31,776
- I work.
- Right. <i>Parlez-vous français?</i>

56
00:04:31,955 --> 00:04:34,446
- Teaching, it's very hard work.
- Sure.

57
00:04:35,058 --> 00:04:37,788
- I'm taking that class tomorrow.
- Aerobics?

58
00:04:37,961 --> 00:04:42,022
No, Flaubert and the
Domestic Enslavement of Women.

59
00:04:42,198 --> 00:04:45,929
Or, Does a Person with a Penis
Have to Be a Dickhead?

60
00:04:46,102 --> 00:04:48,593
That's perfect. You should pass.

61
00:04:49,005 --> 00:04:51,303
That's right.

62
00:05:05,021 --> 00:05:06,420
Shut up!

63
00:05:12,795 --> 00:05:15,389
Can you drop me
where you found me?

64
00:05:16,032 --> 00:05:20,059
As soon as this damn traffic
starts moving.

65
00:05:54,170 --> 00:05:57,697
- I'm sorry. I am.
- Me too.

66
00:06:01,144 --> 00:06:05,205
- I didn't mean it.
- No, me either.

67
00:06:06,816 --> 00:06:08,283
- It's just...
- I know.

68
00:06:08,451 --> 00:06:10,578
- Sometimes...
- I know.

69
00:07:02,004 --> 00:07:05,440
I think we should stop
seeing each other.

70
00:07:09,779 --> 00:07:12,407
I mean, what is it, two years?

71
00:07:13,483 --> 00:07:16,111
Two and a half years.

72
00:07:16,919 --> 00:07:19,251
What's the point?

73
00:07:21,124 --> 00:07:25,390
Two and a half years.
What have we been doing?

74
00:07:26,229 --> 00:07:28,789
I don't know anymore.

75
00:07:28,965 --> 00:07:31,866
I don't know what to do, okay?

76
00:07:33,336 --> 00:07:34,894
Try.

77
00:07:35,071 --> 00:07:37,301
We're supposed to try.

78
00:07:37,507 --> 00:07:40,772
We are supposed to make
some kind of an effort.

79
00:07:40,943 --> 00:07:43,935
Something goes wrong, you walk.
What is that?

80
00:07:44,113 --> 00:07:47,844
I don't want to see you
anymore either, but I see you.

81
00:08:02,331 --> 00:08:05,596
Who says we want
what we think we want?

82
00:08:06,002 --> 00:08:10,939
We want what we think we're supposed
to want, things books tell us to want.

83
00:08:11,407 --> 00:08:12,806
That's what I wanted.

84
00:08:13,009 --> 00:08:13,998
Happy.

85
00:08:14,210 --> 00:08:17,873
Happy, happy, happy.
Shit like that, okay?

86
00:08:18,347 --> 00:08:19,905
We didn't get that.

87
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:24,516
That's the end of that.
It's not the end of us.

88
00:08:25,421 --> 00:08:27,048
It's the end of a dream.

89
00:08:27,223 --> 00:08:32,786
You wake up in the morning,
and the dream is over. So what?

90
00:08:33,896 --> 00:08:37,332
I'm still here. You're still here.
We're still here.

91
00:08:37,533 --> 00:08:39,091
Okay?

92
00:08:40,536 --> 00:08:42,163
Yeah.

93
00:08:43,272 --> 00:08:45,934
So maybe we should...

94
00:08:51,447 --> 00:08:56,407
- Maybe we should not see each other.
- That's what I said.

95
00:09:40,630 --> 00:09:45,363
She doesn't want you to call.
If she wanted to talk, she'd call you.

96
00:09:45,568 --> 00:09:49,527
What am I going to say? Hello?
Hello is good.

97
00:09:50,906 --> 00:09:53,067
Hi, it's me.

98
00:09:53,876 --> 00:09:55,867
Hello, it's me.

99
00:09:57,046 --> 00:10:00,504
Hi, Monica, it's me, Steve. Jesus.

100
00:10:00,683 --> 00:10:02,048
Hey.

101
00:10:02,985 --> 00:10:05,453
Hi, remember me?

102
00:10:05,655 --> 00:10:08,055
Christ, just...

103
00:10:08,224 --> 00:10:11,421
Just do it. All right?

104
00:10:21,470 --> 00:10:25,804
I thought I'd drop in and say hi,
but I thought I should call.

105
00:10:26,008 --> 00:10:30,411
Check if you're in, if it's okay,
that you haven't got anybody...

106
00:10:30,613 --> 00:10:34,140
...with you or anything,
that you're by yourself.

107
00:10:35,484 --> 00:10:36,974
I don't know.

108
00:10:37,186 --> 00:10:39,347
I've been going out a lot lately.

109
00:10:39,555 --> 00:10:41,989
No, actually I've been... No.

110
00:10:42,158 --> 00:10:44,786
I've been going out. I'm working.

111
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:47,622
Going out. Working.

112
00:10:51,233 --> 00:10:55,795
I've been going out and working.
I've been seeing lots of women.

113
00:10:58,140 --> 00:10:59,903
Monica. Okay.

114
00:11:00,076 --> 00:11:02,943
Yeah, it's that time of year again.

115
00:11:04,747 --> 00:11:07,841
I'm photographing lima beans.

116
00:11:09,051 --> 00:11:11,542
Yeah, they're beautiful.

117
00:11:15,991 --> 00:11:19,552
Why don't you call me,
for fuck's sake?

118
00:11:29,805 --> 00:11:31,864
Hey, you want to go out?

119
00:11:32,074 --> 00:11:36,010
I don't know, we could
go to a restaurant...

120
00:11:36,212 --> 00:11:38,407
...go to a movie, eat something.

121
00:11:38,614 --> 00:11:41,811
Go out. Out, out, you know, out. Okay?

122
00:11:42,017 --> 00:11:44,247
I'd like to see you.

123
00:11:44,987 --> 00:11:49,185
Yeah, it'd be nice to see you.
Don't you think?

124
00:11:49,658 --> 00:11:51,558
Wouldn't it?

125
00:11:52,928 --> 00:11:54,327
Yeah?

126
00:11:54,797 --> 00:11:57,425
Yeah, yeah.

127
00:11:57,633 --> 00:12:02,832
I don't know. I don't know, I just...
Just to see you, you know? Come on.

128
00:12:03,005 --> 00:12:07,032
No, no, I just... No.

129
00:12:07,309 --> 00:12:10,403
I mean, just see you, okay?

130
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:12,404
No, I just...

131
00:12:12,615 --> 00:12:14,173
Yeah.

132
00:12:15,684 --> 00:12:21,179
Look, I know we're not supposed to see
each other. I know what we said.

133
00:12:21,390 --> 00:12:22,721
Yeah.

134
00:12:25,728 --> 00:12:29,027
I'm not forcing you. Okay?
I'm not forcing you.

135
00:12:29,231 --> 00:12:30,994
How could I force you?

136
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:33,361
I'm just saying...

137
00:12:33,636 --> 00:12:35,501
I'm saying...

138
00:12:36,405 --> 00:12:40,239
Look, I'm saying... I've said it. I...

139
00:12:40,443 --> 00:12:41,808
Yeah.

140
00:12:43,078 --> 00:12:44,375
Yeah.

141
00:12:44,547 --> 00:12:46,777
All right. All right.

142
00:12:46,982 --> 00:12:52,750
Jesus. All right, now, look, I'm sorry
I called, okay? Don't worry about it.

143
00:12:52,922 --> 00:12:55,152
No, no.

144
00:12:55,991 --> 00:12:57,822
No, no.

145
00:12:58,027 --> 00:12:59,790
No, it's not important.

146
00:12:59,995 --> 00:13:01,428
Okay?

147
00:13:02,031 --> 00:13:04,090
I told you.

148
00:13:06,469 --> 00:13:10,599
I told you why I called, okay?
I'm not gonna tell you again.

149
00:13:10,806 --> 00:13:13,673
All right? It's not important. Okay?

150
00:13:13,876 --> 00:13:17,073
Go back to whatever
you're doing. It's fine.

151
00:13:17,646 --> 00:13:19,546
Okay, yeah.

152
00:13:19,748 --> 00:13:21,181
Bye.

153
00:13:21,350 --> 00:13:22,817
Yeah.

154
00:13:24,453 --> 00:13:26,216
Bye.

155
00:13:32,127 --> 00:13:35,528
I called you because
I wanted to see you!

156
00:14:22,845 --> 00:14:24,608
Don't move.

157
00:14:26,115 --> 00:14:27,878
Don't move.

158
00:14:28,083 --> 00:14:31,052
Come on, please,
please. Don't move.

159
00:14:31,253 --> 00:14:34,416
Stay, stay, stay.

160
00:14:35,090 --> 00:14:36,751
- Your leg.
- What?

161
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:39,223
- Your leg.
- What leg?

162
00:14:39,428 --> 00:14:43,125
- This one.
- I can't feel it. Where is it?

163
00:14:43,299 --> 00:14:44,732
Here.

164
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:47,625
Is that my leg?

165
00:14:47,803 --> 00:14:50,499
Yes, that's your leg.

166
00:14:50,706 --> 00:14:56,042
Jesus, my whole body.
What do you do to me?

167
00:14:57,179 --> 00:14:59,010
Drugs.

168
00:15:01,317 --> 00:15:06,254
- We didn't do any drugs, did we?
- No.

169
00:15:07,122 --> 00:15:11,855
- Did we have a lot to drink?
- We didn't have anything to drink.

170
00:15:12,061 --> 00:15:13,961
At dinner?

171
00:15:14,663 --> 00:15:19,362
- We didn't go to dinner.
- I thought we were going to dinner.

172
00:15:19,568 --> 00:15:21,900
We didn't make it.

173
00:15:24,206 --> 00:15:26,401
Then all this...?

174
00:15:26,609 --> 00:15:32,377
You mean, all this
is just from the sex?

175
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:55,730
- We must've been really horny.
- Yeah, I guess so.

176
00:15:55,938 --> 00:15:58,429
It's amazing, isn't it?

177
00:15:58,974 --> 00:16:04,002
Everything else is falling apart.
I mean, with us.

178
00:16:05,047 --> 00:16:08,175
And the sex is getting better.

179
00:16:08,384 --> 00:16:11,410
I don't want to talk
about it, all right?

180
00:16:13,822 --> 00:16:18,782
In the beginning,
it was really terrible.

181
00:16:19,428 --> 00:16:20,952
I mean, the sex.

182
00:16:21,163 --> 00:16:25,190
- Do you remember how bad it was?
- No.

183
00:16:25,367 --> 00:16:29,098
Fucking amateurs.
I thought we'd never get it right.

184
00:16:29,705 --> 00:16:35,268
I was just making an observation.
As the relationship has deteriorated...

185
00:16:35,778 --> 00:16:38,110
- I got it.
...we fuck like monkeys.

186
00:16:47,356 --> 00:16:49,824
Where do you want to eat?

187
00:16:50,826 --> 00:16:51,918
What?

188
00:16:54,530 --> 00:16:57,624
I thought we were going to dinner.

189
00:16:59,835 --> 00:17:04,431
- Now?
- Yeah, now. It's not that late.

190
00:17:04,606 --> 00:17:07,439
It's not... It's not that it's late. I...

191
00:17:08,010 --> 00:17:14,006
- I'm starving, honey. Aren't you hungry?
- Yeah, I could eat.

192
00:17:14,183 --> 00:17:17,050
- I don't know.
- Well?

193
00:17:17,219 --> 00:17:21,713
What's the problem? I thought
you said you wanted to go to dinner.

194
00:17:21,890 --> 00:17:23,824
But that was before.

195
00:17:23,992 --> 00:17:27,519
- Before what?
- Before this.

196
00:17:30,065 --> 00:17:31,692
Yeah.

197
00:17:32,201 --> 00:17:37,537
But we would have
ended up in a bed anyway.

198
00:17:37,973 --> 00:17:41,306
Now that it's out of the way,
it's better.

199
00:17:41,477 --> 00:17:45,106
Takes the pressure off
the rest of the evening.

200
00:17:56,892 --> 00:17:59,292
Why do you say things like that?

201
00:17:59,661 --> 00:18:01,856
- Like what?
- "Takes the pressure off."

202
00:18:02,030 --> 00:18:04,396
What does that mean?

203
00:18:04,566 --> 00:18:06,727
I don't know.

204
00:18:07,870 --> 00:18:10,600
I thought you were...

205
00:18:11,473 --> 00:18:15,273
...ecstatically happy to see me.
- And I was. I am.

206
00:18:15,477 --> 00:18:17,035
So?

207
00:18:17,246 --> 00:18:20,079
- So, what?
- So maybe that means something.

208
00:18:20,282 --> 00:18:23,149
Would you pass me that bowl?
Thank you.

209
00:18:23,352 --> 00:18:26,651
Like maybe we should
be seeing each other again.

210
00:18:34,496 --> 00:18:38,091
- I thought we were breaking up.
- Well...

211
00:18:40,402 --> 00:18:42,302
What do you think?

212
00:18:42,504 --> 00:18:46,133
We shouldn't talk like it
was a trip to the dentist.

213
00:18:46,308 --> 00:18:49,402
- It was good.
- Something to get out of the way.

214
00:18:49,578 --> 00:18:51,569
I didn't mean it like that.

215
00:18:51,780 --> 00:18:55,079
- Why did you say it like that?
- Because.

216
00:18:56,151 --> 00:18:57,618
What?

217
00:19:00,656 --> 00:19:03,921
When we were going out
to dinner or something...

218
00:19:04,126 --> 00:19:08,790
...it was always better if we,
you know, had sex before we went out.

219
00:19:08,964 --> 00:19:11,364
For me, it was better.

220
00:19:12,768 --> 00:19:14,235
Why?

221
00:19:14,436 --> 00:19:17,837
I don't know. I just always
had a better time.

222
00:19:19,942 --> 00:19:22,968
- In bed?
- No.

223
00:19:23,178 --> 00:19:26,375
At dinner or wherever we went after.

224
00:19:26,548 --> 00:19:28,743
I don't get it.

225
00:19:28,917 --> 00:19:31,477
It's not important.

226
00:19:44,199 --> 00:19:47,100
You really gotta let me buy the wine.

227
00:19:47,269 --> 00:19:50,534
Didn't I leave a half a dozen
bottles of Napa here?

228
00:19:50,706 --> 00:19:54,301
The cab sauv? What happened to them?

229
00:19:57,713 --> 00:20:01,274
Okay, bad question.
I hope he enjoyed them.

230
00:20:05,721 --> 00:20:07,450
To you, <i>mi querida.</i>

231
00:20:09,224 --> 00:20:15,493
So whatever we were doing, you were
thinking about whether we'd go to bed?

232
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:21,392
It wasn't the only thing
on my mind, okay?

233
00:20:21,603 --> 00:20:24,800
Hey, I'm not a nymphomaniac.

234
00:20:25,007 --> 00:20:27,498
It had nothing to do with the sex.

235
00:20:27,709 --> 00:20:33,545
I wasn't worried about whether I'd get
laid or not. I was worried about...

236
00:20:34,182 --> 00:20:35,672
What?

237
00:20:36,451 --> 00:20:38,282
I don't know.

238
00:20:38,453 --> 00:20:41,388
You. Us, I guess.

239
00:20:41,590 --> 00:20:46,027
How you felt maybe.
It made me nervous.

240
00:20:46,194 --> 00:20:51,461
And then if we made love,
everything was okay.

241
00:20:51,667 --> 00:20:55,364
I thought that it meant
that you loved me. That's all.

242
00:20:55,537 --> 00:21:00,031
And then I could just relax.
I could just be myself.

243
00:21:00,676 --> 00:21:04,737
We were having a good time
because we were good together...

244
00:21:04,947 --> 00:21:08,439
...not because we were
desperate or horny.

245
00:21:09,084 --> 00:21:14,784
I guess I thought it meant there
was a reason for us to be together.

246
00:21:19,194 --> 00:21:22,220
I didn't know you felt like that.

247
00:21:22,431 --> 00:21:25,457
No, I guess you didn't.

248
00:21:30,005 --> 00:21:32,769
You put the carrots in the pasta?

249
00:21:44,486 --> 00:21:45,817
Monica.

250
00:21:46,855 --> 00:21:50,757
- Jesus, what are you doing?
- So you want to go to dinner?

251
00:21:51,593 --> 00:21:54,391
<i>It is not my fault if you cannot cook.</i>

252
00:21:54,563 --> 00:21:57,498
- <i>You are an insensitive bastard.</i>
- <i>Insensitive?</i>

253
00:21:57,666 --> 00:22:02,160
- <i>Want to know what I don't get?</i>
- <i>Get the hell out of here. Me?</i>

254
00:22:02,337 --> 00:22:06,797
- <i>You invited me back.</i>
- <i>Stop calling and sending messages.</i>

255
00:22:07,009 --> 00:22:09,409
- <i>I have not.</i>
- <i>I know it's you.</i>

256
00:22:09,578 --> 00:22:13,912
- <i>Must be your other boyfriends.</i>
- <i>Only you would do that.</i>

257
00:22:14,082 --> 00:22:19,418
- <i>Stay away from me. You are an abuser.</i>
- <i>I'm a what?</i>

258
00:22:19,588 --> 00:22:21,249
- <i>You abuse me.</i>
- <i>Oh, my God!</i>

259
00:22:21,423 --> 00:22:25,484
- <i>Stay the hell away from me.</i>
- <i>You're the one that abuses.</i>

260
00:22:25,660 --> 00:22:29,118
- <i>Stay out of my life.</i>
- <i>I'm going. I'm gone.</i>

261
00:22:29,297 --> 00:22:32,596
- <i>Get it through your head. It's over.</i>
- <i>I'm going.</i>

262
00:22:32,768 --> 00:22:36,295
- <i>Leave me alone. Get out of my life.</i>
- <i>Fine!</i>

263
00:23:14,643 --> 00:23:18,477
Hi. Are you surprised? Really?

264
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:22,582
So am I. I'm surprised at myself.

265
00:23:29,491 --> 00:23:31,118
Steve...

266
00:23:32,060 --> 00:23:34,688
...I miss you. I do.

267
00:23:34,863 --> 00:23:39,129
Well, six weeks is a long time.

268
00:23:39,334 --> 00:23:42,701
No sex, I mean, six.

269
00:23:44,439 --> 00:23:46,430
My phone, Darren.

270
00:23:46,641 --> 00:23:52,045
Say what again? I miss you? Okay.

271
00:23:52,247 --> 00:23:57,275
I miss you. Okay?
Are you happy now? Okay.

272
00:23:58,687 --> 00:24:00,587
You don't have to do that.

273
00:24:00,789 --> 00:24:06,750
You don't have to say it because
I said it. I didn't say it so... You do?

274
00:24:07,562 --> 00:24:09,757
That's nice.

275
00:24:10,565 --> 00:24:11,930
Because.

276
00:24:13,301 --> 00:24:16,031
<i>I hate not seeing you.</i>

277
00:24:17,072 --> 00:24:20,200
And I feel more
comfortable on the phone.

278
00:24:20,408 --> 00:24:24,435
We do better on the phone.
Have you noticed that? We do.

279
00:24:24,613 --> 00:24:27,047
We're nicer to each other.

280
00:24:27,215 --> 00:24:32,676
And if we were on the phone and one of
us was out of town, it was even better.

281
00:24:32,854 --> 00:24:38,986
Look, if you were in Australia
right now, I'd ask you to marry me.

282
00:24:40,028 --> 00:24:43,589
Stop that. Don't be dirty.

283
00:24:43,798 --> 00:24:45,789
Stop it.

284
00:24:46,935 --> 00:24:48,766
Steve...

285
00:24:49,604 --> 00:24:51,765
...l've been thinking.

286
00:24:52,507 --> 00:24:58,002
There used to be reasons for people
to be together, to stay together...

287
00:24:58,180 --> 00:25:02,344
<i>... like stability and security</i>
<i>and even kids.</i>

288
00:25:02,551 --> 00:25:06,920
But you see, I don't need you
for these reasons nowadays.

289
00:25:07,122 --> 00:25:10,751
I mean, I can get all this
on my own if I wanted to.

290
00:25:10,959 --> 00:25:16,761
So if there are no real reasons
for two people to be together...

291
00:25:16,965 --> 00:25:21,425
...then you're into unreal reasons,
fantastic things.

292
00:25:21,636 --> 00:25:25,970
Like happiness and...

293
00:25:26,575 --> 00:25:29,442
...good company and comfort...

294
00:25:29,644 --> 00:25:34,343
...and understanding
and emotional support.

295
00:25:35,217 --> 00:25:38,152
<i>God, you wouldn't ask</i>
<i>that much from a saint.</i>

296
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:44,020
You look at this person that you have
this relationship with, and you think:

297
00:25:44,192 --> 00:25:47,184
"What the heck
is he good for anyway?"

298
00:25:53,235 --> 00:25:56,693
I hate being without you.

299
00:25:57,305 --> 00:25:59,535
I hate it.

300
00:26:01,176 --> 00:26:03,906
It's not right.

301
00:26:06,481 --> 00:26:09,575
Can't we do something about it?

302
00:26:11,419 --> 00:26:13,944
I can't take it.

303
00:26:15,323 --> 00:26:17,655
I can't.

304
00:26:18,326 --> 00:26:20,055
Please.

305
00:27:27,729 --> 00:27:30,698
Steve, what are you doing?

306
00:27:31,032 --> 00:27:33,830
- Nothing.
- What?

307
00:27:34,969 --> 00:27:37,961
- Go back to sleep.
- Are you all right?

308
00:27:38,139 --> 00:27:39,629
Yeah.

309
00:27:40,241 --> 00:27:41,367
Yeah.

310
00:27:41,576 --> 00:27:43,669
Yes, I am.

311
00:27:44,679 --> 00:27:47,807
- Go to sleep.
- Why don't you turn on the light?

312
00:27:48,016 --> 00:27:49,813
I don't need a light.

313
00:27:50,018 --> 00:27:53,715
- You're going to break your neck.
- I can see.

314
00:27:57,359 --> 00:28:00,328
- What are you doing?
- I'm looking for my shoes.

315
00:28:00,495 --> 00:28:02,793
- You're dressed.
- I can't find them.

316
00:28:02,964 --> 00:28:04,659
You're all dressed.

317
00:28:04,866 --> 00:28:08,029
I must have taken them off
in the other room.

318
00:28:21,383 --> 00:28:23,647
- Where are you going?
- I gotta go.

319
00:28:23,818 --> 00:28:25,547
- Where?
- I gotta get home.

320
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:27,051
Why?

321
00:28:28,723 --> 00:28:29,712
It's late.

322
00:28:32,627 --> 00:28:36,996
- Come on, let's go back to bed.
- Look, I woke you. I'm sorry.

323
00:28:37,198 --> 00:28:40,599
- You woke me?
- Yeah.

324
00:28:40,902 --> 00:28:43,996
What were you going to do? Just leave?

325
00:28:44,439 --> 00:28:45,906
Yeah.

326
00:28:56,818 --> 00:28:59,412
What is going on?

327
00:28:59,587 --> 00:29:01,578
- Nothing.
- Nothing?

328
00:29:01,756 --> 00:29:04,816
- Nothing.
- What happened?

329
00:29:05,093 --> 00:29:06,390
Nothing.

330
00:29:06,561 --> 00:29:10,327
- Well, why are you leaving?
- I gotta get up.

331
00:29:10,532 --> 00:29:14,866
- Besides that.
- No besides. I gotta get up.

332
00:29:15,069 --> 00:29:18,505
Everybody's gotta get up, Steve.
I gotta get up.

333
00:29:18,706 --> 00:29:21,937
The whole world's gotta get up.

334
00:29:22,110 --> 00:29:25,341
We can talk about that one
some other time.

335
00:29:29,884 --> 00:29:34,844
- I'm going crazy.
- See, that's different.

336
00:29:38,193 --> 00:29:44,325
I thought it was your everyday,
garden-variety, existential crisis.

337
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:48,135
But crazy is different.

338
00:29:52,874 --> 00:29:55,138
I'll call you tomorrow.

339
00:29:58,546 --> 00:30:00,673
- What is it this time?
- What?

340
00:30:00,882 --> 00:30:03,942
- Did I do something?
- Why do you think that?

341
00:30:04,152 --> 00:30:07,883
Because I always do something.

342
00:30:08,623 --> 00:30:12,184
No, nothing.
You didn't do anything, okay?

343
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:15,852
Look, I don't mind. Really.

344
00:30:16,064 --> 00:30:20,057
I mean, we're not even
seeing each other anymore...

345
00:30:20,235 --> 00:30:21,827
...so it doesn't matter.

346
00:30:22,036 --> 00:30:25,403
But just as a favor, since it
makes no difference...

347
00:30:25,573 --> 00:30:28,906
...could you not disappear
in the night like a thief...

348
00:30:29,077 --> 00:30:33,480
...like you realized that you're at
the wrong place, like you made...

349
00:30:33,648 --> 00:30:37,675
...this horrible mistake?
So I don't have to worry...

350
00:30:37,852 --> 00:30:42,789
...that I upset you or disappointed
you or hurt you or drooled on you.

351
00:30:42,991 --> 00:30:47,894
Just this once, I'd like to get laid
and get a good night's sleep, okay?

352
00:30:48,530 --> 00:30:52,489
What do you say? For old times' sake.

353
00:30:54,736 --> 00:30:58,695
Come on, we'll go to sleep.
We'll wake up in the morning.

354
00:30:59,274 --> 00:31:04,177
I'll make you some coffee.
We'll read the paper.

355
00:31:08,883 --> 00:31:11,443
You never disappointed me.

356
00:31:12,053 --> 00:31:14,180
I didn't?

357
00:31:16,624 --> 00:31:18,182
No.

358
00:31:20,461 --> 00:31:22,861
That's what I thought.

359
00:31:25,466 --> 00:31:28,401
No, no, no, no, no.

360
00:31:31,472 --> 00:31:33,406
I was afraid.

361
00:31:34,475 --> 00:31:36,773
I used to wake up...

362
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:43,110
I'd fall asleep and then be wide awake,
and I had to get out.

363
00:31:43,318 --> 00:31:46,412
- Why?
- Not because it was bad, okay?

364
00:31:46,621 --> 00:31:51,115
But because being here with you...

365
00:31:51,326 --> 00:31:55,422
...everything else
was far away, just gone.

366
00:31:55,630 --> 00:32:00,067
Me and my life, and every day
what I do and who I am.

367
00:32:00,268 --> 00:32:04,329
I was losing that here.
I'd wake up and think, "It's gone.

368
00:32:04,505 --> 00:32:06,132
I'm gone."

369
00:32:07,609 --> 00:32:10,806
I've gotta get back to see
if it's still there.

370
00:32:11,079 --> 00:32:13,309
See if I'm still there.

371
00:32:13,514 --> 00:32:15,345
Because here...

372
00:32:22,457 --> 00:32:24,982
I don't know who I am here.

373
00:32:25,159 --> 00:32:27,491
I get lost here.

374
00:32:27,695 --> 00:32:31,859
- Is that such a bad thing?
- It's not that it's bad. All right?

375
00:32:32,066 --> 00:32:35,058
It's not good or bad.
It just takes over.

376
00:32:35,269 --> 00:32:40,104
- It changes everything.
- It's supposed to change everything.

377
00:32:40,308 --> 00:32:41,741
Yeah.

378
00:32:42,443 --> 00:32:45,241
- Love, right?
- Right.

379
00:32:47,281 --> 00:32:50,375
But suppose it doesn't last.

380
00:32:50,585 --> 00:32:56,114
I gotta hang on to what I have besides
this, to who I am away from this.

381
00:32:56,891 --> 00:32:58,449
Because...

382
00:32:59,060 --> 00:33:03,759
If this isn't gonna last, and this
is all I have, and it doesn't last...

383
00:33:03,931 --> 00:33:05,455
...who am I?

384
00:33:06,467 --> 00:33:09,061
What are you so afraid of now?

385
00:33:09,270 --> 00:33:12,205
I'm afraid that I won't...

386
00:33:13,675 --> 00:33:17,304
...ever love anybody
as much as I love you.

387
00:33:20,882 --> 00:33:22,315
I can't.

388
00:33:22,483 --> 00:33:25,145
I just can't, okay?

389
00:33:28,189 --> 00:33:29,417
I gotta go.

390
00:33:30,591 --> 00:33:32,491
It'll be okay, you know?

391
00:33:32,694 --> 00:33:35,925
I was looking for my shirt.
Can you get it to me?

392
00:33:36,097 --> 00:33:38,861
Or I'll come and get it or something.

393
00:33:40,134 --> 00:33:42,295
Shit.

394
00:35:53,034 --> 00:35:57,664
- So how have you been?
- <i>I've been great, yeah. No, terrific.</i>

395
00:35:57,839 --> 00:36:00,205
<i>It was funny seeing you like that.</i>

396
00:36:00,374 --> 00:36:02,171
And in that restaurant.

397
00:36:02,777 --> 00:36:05,837
- We were looking for a place to eat...
- <i>Us too.</i>

398
00:36:06,013 --> 00:36:09,107
Then, I don't know, there we were.

399
00:36:09,584 --> 00:36:12,485
Yeah, turned around,
and there you were.

400
00:36:12,653 --> 00:36:14,553
- She was cute.
- <i>What?</i>

401
00:36:14,722 --> 00:36:18,055
- What's her name? Muffy.
- Right, she's a friend.

402
00:36:18,226 --> 00:36:20,126
- <i>She seemed really nice.</i>
- Yeah.

403
00:36:20,294 --> 00:36:24,754
- So is it serious?
- Well, kind of, you know...

404
00:36:24,932 --> 00:36:30,302
- None of my business, I'm just curious.
- Off and on, on and off, you know?

405
00:36:30,471 --> 00:36:34,134
And other women, like, you know, yeah.

406
00:36:34,308 --> 00:36:39,905
- I've been enjoying myself, you know?
- Anyway, it was nice seeing you.

407
00:36:40,081 --> 00:36:42,379
Who, me? Him?

408
00:36:42,550 --> 00:36:46,111
No. No, not serious.

409
00:36:46,287 --> 00:36:48,084
Well, actually...

410
00:36:48,256 --> 00:36:50,315
...I don't know.
- What?

411
00:36:50,491 --> 00:36:53,824
He goes to the gym a lot.
It shows, doesn't it?

412
00:36:54,295 --> 00:36:57,992
Three times a week,
and aerobics every day in between.

413
00:36:58,599 --> 00:36:59,896
<i>Vitamins.</i>

414
00:37:00,835 --> 00:37:05,772
Are you joking? This guy
has a separate suitcase for them.

415
00:37:05,940 --> 00:37:09,398
Minerals, amino acids,
antioxidants, you name it.

416
00:37:09,577 --> 00:37:13,069
When we started going out,
I thought he was on drugs.

417
00:37:13,247 --> 00:37:16,648
He kept popping these things
into his mouth.

418
00:37:16,817 --> 00:37:21,220
Turns out it was bran.
Yeah, you heard right, bran.

419
00:37:21,389 --> 00:37:26,918
There's no part of him that somebody
doesn't do something to once a day.

420
00:37:27,094 --> 00:37:30,723
He has this schedule.
So even if he wanted to work...

421
00:37:30,898 --> 00:37:32,889
- <i>... he doesn't have time.</i>
- Really?

422
00:37:33,067 --> 00:37:35,661
He's got money.
He goes to Switzerland...

423
00:37:35,836 --> 00:37:39,169
...to check on buildings
and get his blood changed.

424
00:37:39,340 --> 00:37:43,276
Then he goes to this doctor
who shoots him up with vitamin C.

425
00:37:43,444 --> 00:37:48,609
<i>Oh, my God, Steve, I went</i>
<i>with him once. He plugs in an IV...</i>

426
00:37:48,783 --> 00:37:51,445
<i>... then starts playing</i>
<i>the piano and talking...</i>

427
00:37:51,619 --> 00:37:55,248
<i>... about Kant and Doekovsky...</i>

428
00:37:55,423 --> 00:38:00,053
- <i>... and Van Bankin. Hello!</i>
- Yeah, really?

429
00:38:00,227 --> 00:38:03,560
<i>It's funny, he has everything</i>
<i>done to him. Facials...</i>

430
00:38:03,731 --> 00:38:08,930
<i>... manicures, pedicures,</i>
<i>high colonics. You know what that is?</i>

431
00:38:09,103 --> 00:38:11,298
<i>You don't want to know.</i>

432
00:38:11,472 --> 00:38:15,499
<i>You're on fire. You're so hot.</i>

433
00:38:16,610 --> 00:38:19,977
<i>I shouldn't be saying all this.</i>
<i>It's not fair.</i>

434
00:38:20,147 --> 00:38:23,844
Because I like him. I do.

435
00:38:24,018 --> 00:38:29,046
<i>I see what he's doing. He's fighting.</i>
<i>He's fighting hard.</i>

436
00:38:29,223 --> 00:38:32,283
<i>Growing old, he's fighting it.</i>

437
00:38:32,460 --> 00:38:35,429
When we're together,
just the two of us...

438
00:38:36,764 --> 00:38:40,530
<i>I don't know, he holds on.</i>
<i>He likes life.</i>

439
00:38:40,701 --> 00:38:43,169
He wants it. He fights for it.

440
00:38:44,138 --> 00:38:47,767
He's selfish. Dishonest.
I think he lies to me.

441
00:38:48,142 --> 00:38:52,169
He's not very bright.
He's sort of funny-looking.

442
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:54,914
<i>But he loves life.</i>

443
00:38:57,551 --> 00:39:00,486
<i>It's amazing in this day and age.</i>

444
00:39:00,654 --> 00:39:06,490
<i>It's contagious to be with somebody</i>
<i>like that, who loves living so much.</i>

445
00:39:09,663 --> 00:39:11,995
<i>Isn't it amazing?</i>

446
00:39:12,166 --> 00:39:13,360
<i>It's amazing!</i>

447
00:39:14,468 --> 00:39:16,368
<i>It's amazing! He loves life.</i>

448
00:39:17,271 --> 00:39:18,499
<i>Isn't it?</i>

449
00:39:22,610 --> 00:39:24,009
<i>Isn't it?</i>

450
00:39:24,211 --> 00:39:25,371
Steve?

451
00:39:25,546 --> 00:39:27,138
<i>More!</i>

452
00:39:28,315 --> 00:39:29,680
Steve?

453
00:39:32,686 --> 00:39:34,119
Steve?

454
00:40:21,335 --> 00:40:23,633
I want to get married.

455
00:40:23,804 --> 00:40:27,296
- What?
- I want to get married.

456
00:40:30,211 --> 00:40:34,147
- Well...
- Yeah, I do.

457
00:40:34,682 --> 00:40:36,309
Okay.

458
00:40:36,851 --> 00:40:38,876
- I do.
- Well, if you do, you do.

459
00:40:39,053 --> 00:40:40,816
I do.

460
00:40:41,689 --> 00:40:43,714
- When?
- Right away.

461
00:40:43,891 --> 00:40:49,124
Yeah, before I change my mind,
you know? I think it's the right thing.

462
00:40:49,296 --> 00:40:52,527
I thought about it,
and that's what I think.

463
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:54,634
What do you think?

464
00:40:55,236 --> 00:40:57,067
- What does she think?
- Who?

465
00:40:57,238 --> 00:41:00,173
I don't know. I haven't told her.

466
00:41:00,841 --> 00:41:04,140
- I'm telling you.
- Thanks.

467
00:41:06,647 --> 00:41:08,342
You.

468
00:41:09,717 --> 00:41:11,582
I mean you.

469
00:41:13,821 --> 00:41:18,087
- You want to get married to me?
- Yes.

470
00:41:18,559 --> 00:41:22,495
- You want us to get married?
- Yes.

471
00:41:22,997 --> 00:41:25,465
- You and me?
- Yeah.

472
00:41:25,633 --> 00:41:28,659
It's not gonna work with her.
I can see that.

473
00:41:28,836 --> 00:41:34,172
I mean, it's working. It's working,
but it's not gonna work, you know?

474
00:41:36,443 --> 00:41:39,310
- Jesus.
- Maybe I should start this again.

475
00:41:40,548 --> 00:41:43,540
- You want to get married to me?
- Yes.

476
00:41:43,717 --> 00:41:46,049
No, look.

477
00:41:46,220 --> 00:41:48,552
I'm working at it. Okay?

478
00:41:48,722 --> 00:41:50,747
I'm trying. Honest to God.

479
00:41:50,925 --> 00:41:53,951
I'm doing okay,
better than I've ever done.

480
00:41:54,128 --> 00:41:58,064
Better than with you. I'm patient,
I'm not pushy, not crazy.

481
00:41:58,666 --> 00:42:03,365
I see things the way they are.
She is what she is.

482
00:42:03,904 --> 00:42:07,670
She's not who I think she is,
not who I want her to be.

483
00:42:07,975 --> 00:42:10,500
We don't fight. We don't argue.

484
00:42:10,678 --> 00:42:16,082
We tell the truth. I think we tell
the truth. It sounds like the truth.

485
00:42:16,250 --> 00:42:18,445
We share. We share all of it.

486
00:42:18,619 --> 00:42:21,679
It's very understanding,
very easy like that.

487
00:42:22,489 --> 00:42:24,480
So fucking dull.

488
00:42:30,497 --> 00:42:32,089
I need some air.

489
00:42:32,266 --> 00:42:34,666
It's not like I'm complaining.

490
00:42:34,835 --> 00:42:37,668
If that's what it has to be,
I understand.

491
00:42:37,838 --> 00:42:41,968
We could never make anything
work anyway, so why not try dull?

492
00:42:42,142 --> 00:42:43,837
Maybe dull will last.

493
00:42:44,011 --> 00:42:47,071
But as dull as it is,
it's the same thing.

494
00:42:47,248 --> 00:42:50,183
A couple words, looks,
wrong moves and bang...

495
00:42:50,351 --> 00:42:52,649
...it's over. Then you break up...

496
00:42:52,820 --> 00:42:55,288
...find somebody else
and start all over.

497
00:42:55,456 --> 00:42:57,390
I can't do that.

498
00:42:57,558 --> 00:42:59,355
I did it with you. I...

499
00:42:59,526 --> 00:43:02,086
I can't do it with somebody else.

500
00:43:02,329 --> 00:43:06,959
All that time to get someplace
with her that I'm already at with you?

501
00:43:07,134 --> 00:43:08,761
That hit me. It hit me.

502
00:43:08,936 --> 00:43:11,166
We can't quit. We have something.

503
00:43:11,338 --> 00:43:13,238
We can't just throw it away.

504
00:43:13,407 --> 00:43:16,865
Okay, I admit,
it's a failure, but it's ours.

505
00:43:17,044 --> 00:43:24,177
It's not the end. That's too easy.
It's the place to start from.

506
00:43:24,351 --> 00:43:28,219
It's two and a half years
of our lives. It's an investment.

507
00:43:28,389 --> 00:43:30,323
All that pain to get to zero?

508
00:43:30,491 --> 00:43:34,325
Okay, well, now we're here.
You know, we've got nothing.

509
00:43:34,495 --> 00:43:38,898
Nothing works.
We're finished. Total. Complete.

510
00:43:39,066 --> 00:43:45,232
Everything we had is gone. We haven't
got a hope, a prayer or a chance.

511
00:43:45,406 --> 00:43:49,274
That's it. I really think
we should get married.

512
00:43:49,443 --> 00:43:52,537
I'm free Thursday.
You want to get married then?

513
00:43:52,713 --> 00:43:54,112
- Don't do that.
- What?

514
00:43:54,281 --> 00:43:56,749
- Don't make jokes.
- Well...

515
00:43:56,917 --> 00:43:58,384
Monica.

516
00:44:00,654 --> 00:44:02,519
This isn't easy.

517
00:44:03,657 --> 00:44:07,787
Do you think this is easy for me?
This is important, all right?

518
00:44:07,961 --> 00:44:10,691
People are living real lives
with problems.

519
00:44:10,864 --> 00:44:13,389
We're running around like teenagers.

520
00:44:13,567 --> 00:44:18,300
She loves me. She loves me not. I love
her. Who gives a fuck, all right?

521
00:44:18,472 --> 00:44:24,035
I want this over with. I want it out
of the way. Final. Total. Complete.

522
00:44:24,211 --> 00:44:26,679
Married. The two of us.

523
00:44:26,847 --> 00:44:31,250
So we can stop wasting time
and do something with our lives.

524
00:44:31,418 --> 00:44:33,784
- One way to look at it.
- The only way.

525
00:44:33,954 --> 00:44:38,015
- What about divorce? People...
- No. No divorce.

526
00:44:38,192 --> 00:44:41,252
No question of divorce.
Divorce is out.

527
00:44:41,428 --> 00:44:45,694
- Then we should get married in Iran.
- Yes. Fine. Good.

528
00:44:45,866 --> 00:44:51,429
- But I'd have to wear a veil for life.
- They take them off in the house.

529
00:44:51,605 --> 00:44:54,438
- Oh, well...
- Iran is good. Iran is the answer.

530
00:44:54,608 --> 00:44:57,509
At least there,
these things mean something.

531
00:44:57,678 --> 00:45:02,047
- I think men still fool around in Iran.
- No. No fooling around.

532
00:45:02,216 --> 00:45:04,081
- Penalty of death.
- Really?

533
00:45:04,251 --> 00:45:07,311
Yeah, you fool around,
they chop off your dick.

534
00:45:08,122 --> 00:45:09,885
Don't laugh.

535
00:45:10,257 --> 00:45:13,055
You make me crazy when you laugh.

536
00:45:15,763 --> 00:45:18,129
God, you're so beautiful.

537
00:45:19,066 --> 00:45:24,094
I miss you. We tried this breaking up
shit, and it just doesn't work.

538
00:45:25,706 --> 00:45:27,469
Marry me.

539
00:45:28,342 --> 00:45:30,037
Please.

540
00:45:59,573 --> 00:46:02,406
- You know something?
- What?

541
00:46:02,576 --> 00:46:04,510
Honestly...

542
00:46:04,945 --> 00:46:08,244
...it doesn't sound so bad.
- No, it's not.

543
00:46:08,415 --> 00:46:12,078
It's the right thing.
It's the way it should be.

544
00:46:12,252 --> 00:46:15,813
- Except...
- No, don't "except." I know I'm right.

545
00:46:15,989 --> 00:46:20,551
- All right, suppose we do this.
- Good.

546
00:46:20,727 --> 00:46:22,820
- We make this commitment.
- Right.

547
00:46:22,996 --> 00:46:25,760
- Till death do us part.
- Absolutely.

548
00:46:25,933 --> 00:46:27,662
- What happens if...?
- It won't.

549
00:46:27,835 --> 00:46:30,497
- Just... What happens if...?
- It won't happen.

550
00:46:30,671 --> 00:46:33,765
- You're not listening to me.
- Why should I listen?

551
00:46:33,941 --> 00:46:39,709
I know I'm right, and when I'm right,
I'm really, really right. Okay?

552
00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:41,643
So...

553
00:46:45,519 --> 00:46:47,146
...just...

554
00:46:49,122 --> 00:46:51,147
...stop talking...

555
00:46:53,994 --> 00:46:56,155
...and say, yes.

556
00:47:15,315 --> 00:47:16,976
Yes.

557
00:47:35,102 --> 00:47:39,596
Hi, my name is Monica,
and this is my boyfriend, Steve.

558
00:47:39,773 --> 00:47:44,437
We're getting married soon, and we're
just going around asking people...

559
00:47:44,611 --> 00:47:47,603
...what is it that we can do
to make it last?

560
00:47:47,781 --> 00:47:50,545
- What keeps you together?
- Honesty.

561
00:47:50,717 --> 00:47:51,843
- Friendship.
- Love.

562
00:47:52,019 --> 00:47:53,680
- Trust.
- Good sex.

563
00:47:53,854 --> 00:47:56,322
- You have a body...
- Good sex.

564
00:47:56,490 --> 00:48:01,325
- What do you really need in a marriage?
- You need to love your partner.

565
00:48:01,495 --> 00:48:02,860
And good sex.

566
00:48:03,030 --> 00:48:05,521
You can't make a recipe.
It doesn't work.

567
00:48:05,699 --> 00:48:10,159
A very treacherous institution.
The word "love" itself is a myth.

568
00:48:10,337 --> 00:48:13,534
That's why we're asking.
It's too confusing.

569
00:48:13,707 --> 00:48:17,199
The secret is patience
and understanding.

570
00:48:17,377 --> 00:48:20,073
Now, if you want to go the other way...

571
00:48:20,247 --> 00:48:23,808
What would immediately
break up a relationship?

572
00:48:23,984 --> 00:48:25,178
Not communicating.

573
00:48:25,352 --> 00:48:27,013
- Jealousy.
- Lying.

574
00:48:27,187 --> 00:48:29,212
- You married?
- No, not yet.

575
00:48:29,389 --> 00:48:31,550
- You shave yet?
- No.

576
00:48:31,725 --> 00:48:36,856
One person can't possibly give you
everything that you need and want.

577
00:48:37,030 --> 00:48:39,726
- How long have you been engaged?
- Two years.

578
00:48:39,900 --> 00:48:41,891
I'm not waiting that long.

579
00:48:42,069 --> 00:48:43,229
Two spirits meet...

580
00:48:43,403 --> 00:48:47,533
Starts off heavy in love.
I don't say that you grow...

581
00:48:47,708 --> 00:48:50,370
And grow and grow and grow.

582
00:48:50,911 --> 00:48:52,173
That's what I say.

583
00:48:52,846 --> 00:48:58,341
My wife left me for one of my
best friends, who she used to hate.

584
00:48:58,852 --> 00:49:03,516
He used to repulse her.
And one day, he's the love of her life.

585
00:49:03,857 --> 00:49:09,693
We want to get married and have babies.
You think that's a good idea?

586
00:49:10,397 --> 00:49:12,092
Why?

587
00:49:12,633 --> 00:49:15,261
Do you think I should dump him?

588
00:49:15,435 --> 00:49:20,839
- Dump him in the garbage.
- Dump me in the garbage?!

589
00:50:14,327 --> 00:50:16,124
Einstein.

590
00:50:17,397 --> 00:50:20,195
Theory of relativity.

591
00:50:22,636 --> 00:50:24,968
Do you understand it?

592
00:50:25,138 --> 00:50:27,834
Nobody does.
Nobody did. Especially then...

593
00:50:28,008 --> 00:50:30,841
...beginning of the century.
It was scary.

594
00:50:31,011 --> 00:50:35,175
All people could think was, no more
straight lines or right angles.

595
00:50:35,348 --> 00:50:38,784
No more absolute time.
Motion was curved.

596
00:50:38,952 --> 00:50:40,317
What does that mean?

597
00:50:40,487 --> 00:50:42,887
- I don't know.
- Right.

598
00:50:43,056 --> 00:50:47,288
Something happened to the world,
and nobody understood it.

599
00:50:47,461 --> 00:50:52,023
It was confusing, and people started
jumping to conclusions.

600
00:50:52,199 --> 00:50:54,759
There are no more absolutes.

601
00:50:54,935 --> 00:50:57,733
Time. Space. Good. Evil.
Things we know...

602
00:50:57,904 --> 00:51:00,304
...things we believe in,
things we see.

603
00:51:00,474 --> 00:51:05,104
We thought we understood these things,
but maybe we don't.

604
00:51:05,278 --> 00:51:09,271
Maybe they're all relative.
Do you follow that?

605
00:51:10,016 --> 00:51:14,043
- You got the Real Estate section?
- Einstein was going crazy.

606
00:51:14,221 --> 00:51:20,490
This is not what he meant, but that's
the way most people understood it.

607
00:51:23,530 --> 00:51:25,430
Moving day.

608
00:51:25,799 --> 00:51:27,767
You think you have freewill.

609
00:51:27,934 --> 00:51:30,960
You make decisions,
you make things happen.

610
00:51:31,138 --> 00:51:36,235
According to Marx, these are
just behavior, superficial behavior.

611
00:51:36,409 --> 00:51:42,075
Underneath this behavior, there are
patterns determining our destiny.

612
00:51:42,249 --> 00:51:45,343
And here's the killer:

613
00:51:49,489 --> 00:51:53,425
We have no control over them.
It doesn't matter what we do...

614
00:51:53,593 --> 00:51:56,653
...it makes no difference
to the path of history.

615
00:51:56,830 --> 00:51:58,855
Want a beach house this summer?

616
00:51:59,032 --> 00:52:01,592
- Can we afford it?
- No.

617
00:52:01,768 --> 00:52:05,169
But after the wedding,
if we don't take a honeymoon.

618
00:52:05,806 --> 00:52:07,273
No honeymoon?

619
00:52:08,508 --> 00:52:11,705
Okay. Are you planning on doing
anything today?

620
00:52:11,878 --> 00:52:14,540
At the same time
that everybody's reeling...

621
00:52:14,714 --> 00:52:17,342
...who comes along? Sigmund Freud.

622
00:52:17,517 --> 00:52:21,544
Things weren't bad enough, right?
Suddenly, we were repressed.

623
00:52:21,721 --> 00:52:25,122
On top of everything else, guilty.

624
00:52:25,292 --> 00:52:29,422
Whenever we did anything,
it was for the wrong reasons.

625
00:52:29,596 --> 00:52:34,260
And what we're really doing,
we're not responsible for.

626
00:52:35,101 --> 00:52:40,266
- Aren't you oversimplifying?
- Of course I'm oversimplifying.

627
00:52:40,440 --> 00:52:44,035
Because I don't understand it.
You can't understand it.

628
00:52:44,211 --> 00:52:47,578
They didn't give us anything
to understand. Except...

629
00:52:47,747 --> 00:52:51,683
Now, before those guys,
we used to understand the world.

630
00:52:51,852 --> 00:52:55,549
And now we don't,
because they proved to us...

631
00:52:55,722 --> 00:52:59,453
...that we don't understand the world.

632
00:53:00,227 --> 00:53:03,890
- Want to give me a hand with this?
- I'm doing the fridge.

633
00:53:05,732 --> 00:53:07,893
Twentieth-century man.

634
00:53:08,068 --> 00:53:09,626
Doubt.

635
00:53:10,971 --> 00:53:14,702
- What are you talking about now?
- You, me, everybody.

636
00:53:14,875 --> 00:53:18,242
It's right there
in the Arts and Leisure section.

637
00:53:19,079 --> 00:53:21,912
This is why
we aren't sure of anything.

638
00:53:22,082 --> 00:53:25,245
This is why we feel cut off. Drifting.

639
00:53:25,418 --> 00:53:28,410
This is why we can't
make a commitment.

640
00:53:28,588 --> 00:53:34,356
This is why people lie, cheat and
steal, and they never think it's wrong.

641
00:53:34,527 --> 00:53:38,224
Nothing means anything to us!
You see what I mean?

642
00:53:38,899 --> 00:53:41,697
Are you saying you don't want
to get married?

643
00:53:45,739 --> 00:53:51,041
- No, I'm saying what I'm saying.
- That's what I thought.

644
00:53:52,979 --> 00:53:56,540
Okay, ready? Let's go.

645
00:53:57,183 --> 00:53:59,208
You're driving.

646
00:54:12,032 --> 00:54:15,229
- Do you think we should have children?
- What?

647
00:54:15,402 --> 00:54:19,304
Do you think we should have children
if we get married?

648
00:54:19,472 --> 00:54:21,804
What do you mean "if"?

649
00:55:43,623 --> 00:55:46,183
- Do you take this man?
- Do you take this woman?

650
00:55:46,359 --> 00:55:49,590
- For better or for worse.
- In sickness or in health.

651
00:55:49,763 --> 00:55:54,257
With the full knowledge that we really
don't know what we are doing.

652
00:56:05,145 --> 00:56:09,582
And that we might exchange
this permanent internal unhappiness...

653
00:56:09,749 --> 00:56:11,910
...for a remolding of reality.

654
00:56:12,085 --> 00:56:16,681
To live free of guilt
and free of personal responsibility.

655
00:56:16,856 --> 00:56:18,915
And all that that doesn't entail.

656
00:56:19,092 --> 00:56:20,992
- To love.
- Honor.

657
00:56:21,161 --> 00:56:23,755
- And obey.
- Obey?

658
00:56:26,966 --> 00:56:29,992
Powerless to alter
or change in any way.

659
00:56:32,305 --> 00:56:35,502
So that it really doesn't matter
what we do.

660
00:56:35,675 --> 00:56:41,636
With a final and conclusive knowledge
that the world is not what it seems.

661
00:56:46,386 --> 00:56:48,946
That you cannot measure
time or space.

662
00:56:49,122 --> 00:56:52,182
- Or right or wrong.
- Or good or evil.

663
00:56:52,358 --> 00:56:56,920
Or the value of anything except
the dollar, the yen, the deutsche mark.

664
00:56:57,097 --> 00:57:02,694
Until death, divorce
or desertion do us part.

665
00:57:02,869 --> 00:57:04,564
I do.

666
00:57:07,707 --> 00:57:09,106
Hello?

667
00:57:09,275 --> 00:57:11,004
I do.

668
00:57:14,714 --> 00:57:16,306
I do.

669
00:57:18,418 --> 00:57:20,443
I do!

670
00:57:21,254 --> 00:57:24,121
I do, I do, I do, I do...

671
00:57:26,025 --> 00:57:29,722
- I do what?
- Take this woman, et cetera, et cetera.

672
00:57:30,029 --> 00:57:31,894
I do.

673
00:57:45,211 --> 00:57:46,610
I do.

674
00:57:46,779 --> 00:57:48,474
Monica.

675
00:57:48,648 --> 00:57:50,673
Yes, Steve?

676
00:57:51,117 --> 00:57:56,419
- This is not a dream.
- No, Steve, this is not a dream.

677
00:57:56,823 --> 00:58:00,259
Now say, "I do," so we can get
the hell out of here.

678
00:58:00,426 --> 00:58:01,757
Okay.

679
00:58:03,596 --> 00:58:05,223
I...

680
00:58:07,033 --> 00:58:08,557
I...

681
00:58:22,682 --> 00:58:24,616
I'll miss you.

682
00:58:29,322 --> 00:58:31,847
I'm sorry you're going.

683
00:58:39,632 --> 00:58:42,260
- I love you.
- Did I give you the keys?

684
00:58:42,435 --> 00:58:43,993
Yes.

685
00:58:45,038 --> 00:58:48,940
I left the number where I'll be
until I get an apartment.

686
00:58:49,209 --> 00:58:50,642
What else?

687
00:58:51,644 --> 00:58:52,770
I don't know.

688
00:58:52,946 --> 00:58:55,710
My mother's sending back
the wedding gifts.

689
00:58:55,882 --> 00:59:00,410
I told her whatever it cost,
we'll split it. The catering, the food.

690
00:59:00,587 --> 00:59:02,987
Okay, sure. I'll call her.

691
00:59:03,990 --> 00:59:07,687
- I wouldn't call her if I were you.
- Why not?

692
00:59:07,860 --> 00:59:12,490
Okay, call her. Just don't be
surprised if she isn't very nice.

693
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:16,730
She thinks it's your fault.

694
00:59:18,104 --> 00:59:21,904
- Why would she think that?
- Because that's what I told her.

695
00:59:23,176 --> 00:59:24,404
Right.

696
00:59:25,311 --> 00:59:28,246
- I couldn't tell her the truth.
- Why not?

697
00:59:30,483 --> 00:59:33,509
Because I don't know
what the truth is.

698
00:59:38,524 --> 00:59:41,152
- She's disappointed?
- Putting it mildly.

699
00:59:41,327 --> 00:59:44,262
She was already
counting grandchildren.

700
00:59:44,430 --> 00:59:46,159
I'm sorry.

701
00:59:47,233 --> 00:59:50,134
- Don't keep saying that, please.
- But I am.

702
00:59:50,303 --> 00:59:54,103
Yeah, so am I.
I'm sorry I ever laid eyes on you.

703
00:59:54,274 --> 00:59:57,607
I'm sorry you exist.
I have a long list of sorries.

704
00:59:57,777 --> 01:00:02,407
But I won't get into them now,
because none of them really matter...

705
01:00:02,582 --> 01:00:07,349
...except for one major, stupid,
unbelievable mistake...

706
01:00:07,520 --> 01:00:10,751
...and that is
that I gave up my apartment...

707
01:00:10,923 --> 01:00:17,089
...to come and live with you.
For that, I am truly, truly sorry.

708
01:00:18,965 --> 01:00:21,832
- Look, you could just stay here.
- Sure.

709
01:00:22,168 --> 01:00:23,294
You could.

710
01:00:23,469 --> 01:00:25,437
Sure, I could.

711
01:00:25,805 --> 01:00:30,640
- But where would you stay?
- Here. Come on, we're both adults.

712
01:00:30,810 --> 01:00:36,180
No, we're not. Are you crazy?
You call this behavior adult?

713
01:00:36,482 --> 01:00:39,940
Besides, I can't stand the sight
of you right now.

714
01:00:40,119 --> 01:00:42,553
Do you understand that?

715
01:00:43,156 --> 01:00:45,624
Look, I told you.

716
01:00:45,925 --> 01:00:48,155
I was confused.

717
01:00:48,328 --> 01:00:50,023
Scared.

718
01:00:50,363 --> 01:00:55,767
I kept looking around, thinking, "Why
are they here? What's so important?"

719
01:00:56,035 --> 01:00:58,936
Before, I thought it would
be a big party.

720
01:00:59,105 --> 01:01:02,802
Everybody will dance
and have a good time.

721
01:01:02,975 --> 01:01:07,435
And then we'd go home, take aspirin,
go to bed, and that's that.

722
01:01:08,881 --> 01:01:12,339
- Till death do us part.
- Right.

723
01:01:18,157 --> 01:01:23,390
- It was your idea, Steve.
- I know, but something happened.

724
01:01:23,563 --> 01:01:25,656
I think it was the rice.

725
01:01:26,232 --> 01:01:30,965
We never even got to the rice.
We never got to "Here Comes the Bride."

726
01:01:31,137 --> 01:01:33,128
But I saw them passing it out.

727
01:01:33,306 --> 01:01:37,037
Bags that people would throw
at us for getting married.

728
01:01:37,210 --> 01:01:40,668
A church is bad luck.
What were we doing in a church?

729
01:01:40,847 --> 01:01:43,839
When was the last time
you were in a Cadillac?

730
01:01:44,016 --> 01:01:45,745
I don't even drive.

731
01:01:45,918 --> 01:01:50,582
I wish you wouldn't try to explain
this. You'll only make it worse.

732
01:01:50,757 --> 01:01:53,783
It just wasn't right.
Any of it. Okay?

733
01:01:53,960 --> 01:01:56,520
It was like being on another planet.

734
01:01:56,696 --> 01:02:00,462
Tuxedos and rice
and Cadillacs and churches.

735
01:02:00,633 --> 01:02:06,071
- What does that have to do with us?
- It's a ceremony. It's just a symbol.

736
01:02:06,239 --> 01:02:09,868
You're not supposed to analyze it.
You just do it.

737
01:02:10,042 --> 01:02:12,772
In the '60s,
they had an alternative.

738
01:02:12,945 --> 01:02:18,144
It was like, "Well, let's get married
in the meadow, just us and God...

739
01:02:18,317 --> 01:02:22,447
...some spaced-out witnesses."
They had that. What have we got?

740
01:02:22,622 --> 01:02:26,149
All right.
Maybe you're right.

741
01:02:26,325 --> 01:02:30,853
We should have done it in a bank
with a word processor and lawyers.

742
01:02:31,030 --> 01:02:33,999
Maybe in Central Park
on Rollerblades.

743
01:02:34,167 --> 01:02:38,433
We should have done a lot of things.
But the point is, we didn't.

744
01:02:38,604 --> 01:02:41,198
We didn't do it.

745
01:02:41,374 --> 01:02:44,639
We didn't do it, did we?

746
01:02:51,484 --> 01:02:52,781
No.

747
01:02:54,821 --> 01:02:55,845
No.

748
01:02:57,690 --> 01:02:59,487
Right.

749
01:03:02,595 --> 01:03:05,792
Okay. That's it.

750
01:03:07,099 --> 01:03:10,398
Enough.
I'm finished.

751
01:03:12,638 --> 01:03:15,471
I'll get the rest of it on Saturday.

752
01:03:15,641 --> 01:03:17,541
Don't go.

753
01:03:17,710 --> 01:03:20,702
I'll call early.
Will you be here Saturday?

754
01:03:21,247 --> 01:03:24,648
- Come on. Don't...
- Will you be here or not?

755
01:03:24,817 --> 01:03:27,115
- Don't go like this.
- Like what?

756
01:03:27,286 --> 01:03:29,447
Like this. Like this.

757
01:03:30,256 --> 01:03:32,554
Don't start, please.

758
01:03:36,162 --> 01:03:38,494
Don't touch me, okay?

759
01:03:38,664 --> 01:03:41,394
- Come on.
- Don't touch my boo-boo.

760
01:03:42,368 --> 01:03:47,135
- Look, just sit down so we can talk.
- I don't wanna talk.

761
01:03:47,306 --> 01:03:50,673
- Don't talk. Just sit down.
- I don't wanna sit down.

762
01:03:50,843 --> 01:03:54,279
Okay, don't sit down.
Just stand there.

763
01:03:54,447 --> 01:03:56,711
Just stand there for a minute.

764
01:03:56,883 --> 01:04:00,250
I don't have a minute. I have to go.

765
01:04:04,156 --> 01:04:07,284
- Why do you have to be so difficult?
- Me?

766
01:04:08,427 --> 01:04:10,987
- Give me a minute.
- What's gonna happen?

767
01:04:12,331 --> 01:04:14,595
Just give me a minute.

768
01:04:14,767 --> 01:04:18,430
It's been going on for years.
You think it will change?

769
01:04:18,604 --> 01:04:22,768
- I'm only asking for a minute!
- You think a miracle will happen?

770
01:04:22,942 --> 01:04:27,242
You see what I'm talking about?
You never give anything a chance!

771
01:04:33,286 --> 01:04:38,553
- I never give anything a chance?
- One way. You see everything one way.

772
01:04:38,724 --> 01:04:43,855
I bought the fucking dress. I sent out
the invitations. I worked on the menu.

773
01:04:44,030 --> 01:04:47,363
- One and one is two.
- I don't give things a chance.

774
01:04:47,533 --> 01:04:51,970
So things don't work out that way,
that's all. What's the big deal?

775
01:04:54,006 --> 01:04:58,705
I believed in you.
I believed you.

776
01:04:59,879 --> 01:05:02,370
That's the big deal.

777
01:05:12,391 --> 01:05:13,688
Are there rules?

778
01:05:13,859 --> 01:05:16,919
I'm crazy to think you know
what you're saying.

779
01:05:17,096 --> 01:05:20,065
Everything happens a certain way?
Bullshit!

780
01:05:20,232 --> 01:05:23,395
- You're stupid and blind.
- You don't know anything.

781
01:05:23,669 --> 01:05:26,604
- I'm not stupid.
- Would you listen to me?

782
01:05:26,772 --> 01:05:29,866
- You listen!
- Why does it always have to be you?

783
01:05:30,042 --> 01:05:34,206
- I stand around like an idiot.
- And it's always my fault.

784
01:05:34,380 --> 01:05:35,847
I'm sick of you. Okay?

785
01:05:36,015 --> 01:05:40,577
You get the hell away from me.
You son of a bitch! Get out of my life!

786
01:05:40,753 --> 01:05:43,517
- I'm sick of you.
- Get out and stay out!

787
01:05:43,689 --> 01:05:45,884
You want the truth?

788
01:05:46,058 --> 01:05:47,047
Nothing.

789
01:05:47,226 --> 01:05:50,889
- You won't even know I'm not there.
- Nothing. Nothing!

790
01:05:51,063 --> 01:05:54,726
- That's all I am to you. Nothing?
- You're nothing to me.

791
01:05:54,900 --> 01:05:56,993
- Nothing?
- Right.

792
01:05:57,169 --> 01:05:58,761
Right.

793
01:06:01,407 --> 01:06:03,375
Okay.

794
01:06:04,310 --> 01:06:06,175
One minute.

795
01:08:22,381 --> 01:08:27,216
I have this number for Monica.
Is she there?

796
01:08:34,293 --> 01:08:35,624
What?

797
01:08:47,473 --> 01:08:51,102
- <i>Hello?</i>
- Hi, it's me.

798
01:08:56,916 --> 01:08:57,974
Hello?

799
01:08:58,751 --> 01:08:59,911
<i>Monica?</i>

800
01:09:01,053 --> 01:09:02,418
<i>Hello?</i>

801
01:09:03,556 --> 01:09:05,046
<i>Hello?</i>

802
01:09:11,630 --> 01:09:14,428
<i>Hi. I'm not in.</i>
<i>You know what to do.</i>

803
01:09:14,600 --> 01:09:17,660
<i>Monica? I know you're</i>...
<i>Fuck.</i>

804
01:09:45,264 --> 01:09:46,856
<i>Hello.</i>

805
01:09:48,567 --> 01:09:50,797
<i>Hello?</i>

806
01:09:51,070 --> 01:09:53,664
<i>Hello!</i>

807
01:10:01,614 --> 01:10:07,951
I did, and now I do.
I always have. I smoke, okay?

808
01:10:11,390 --> 01:10:15,224
Account 1-3-3. I want two...

809
01:10:15,394 --> 01:10:18,158
...parmigiana sandwiches.

810
01:10:18,330 --> 01:10:19,991
I want...

811
01:10:20,766 --> 01:10:23,360
...a large pepperoni.

812
01:10:23,836 --> 01:10:25,667
I want four cheesecakes.

813
01:10:26,305 --> 01:10:32,676
Monica, it's Steve.
I think I'm pregnant, and it's yours.

814
01:10:32,845 --> 01:10:34,779
You should call me.

815
01:10:35,814 --> 01:10:37,406
Please.

816
01:11:46,018 --> 01:11:48,316
<i>Just talk to me.</i>

817
01:11:50,856 --> 01:11:53,381
<i>I miss you so much.</i>

818
01:11:55,794 --> 01:12:00,060
<i>Come on. Please.</i>
<i>Please talk to me.</i>

819
01:12:14,480 --> 01:12:17,244
<i>I know you're thinking about me...</i>

820
01:12:17,416 --> 01:12:20,408
<i>... because I'm thinking</i>
<i>about you all the time.</i>

821
01:12:20,586 --> 01:12:24,215
<i>Every day, every minute.</i>
<i>I'm sorry for hurting you.</i>

822
01:12:24,390 --> 01:12:27,917
<i>I didn't mean to hurt you.</i>
<i>I just gotta see you.</i>

823
01:12:28,093 --> 01:12:30,584
<i>Please. I gotta see you.</i>

824
01:12:31,397 --> 01:12:33,490
<i>I gotta touch you.</i>

825
01:12:59,992 --> 01:13:01,482
It was hard.

826
01:13:02,327 --> 01:13:04,022
It wasn't easy.

827
01:13:04,596 --> 01:13:07,656
- I ran into people.
- They'd tell me things.

828
01:13:07,833 --> 01:13:10,666
- What she was doing.
- What he was up to.

829
01:13:11,703 --> 01:13:15,730
I didn't want to know.
I wanted to know, but I didn't want to.

830
01:13:15,908 --> 01:13:19,400
I didn't want to hear it,
especially if it was good.

831
01:13:19,578 --> 01:13:22,479
Sometimes it was
hard not to ask about her.

832
01:13:22,648 --> 01:13:26,243
- Even if I didn't want to hear anything.
- That changed.

833
01:13:26,685 --> 01:13:30,416
After a while, that stopped.
I think she moved.

834
01:13:31,256 --> 01:13:33,554
She must have finally
found a place.

835
01:13:33,725 --> 01:13:36,387
I think he would have stopped calling.

836
01:13:36,562 --> 01:13:40,191
I mean, even if he knew where I was.

837
01:13:42,801 --> 01:13:46,202
I would have stopped calling.
I mean, eventually.

838
01:13:49,308 --> 01:13:52,368
Somebody had to do something
definite about it.

839
01:13:52,878 --> 01:13:55,438
I think we had to make a clean break.

840
01:13:56,415 --> 01:13:59,441
- People stopped talking.
- I stopped asking.

841
01:14:00,219 --> 01:14:03,245
But I kept thinking about him.

842
01:14:03,822 --> 01:14:05,790
She was still on my mind...

843
01:14:05,958 --> 01:14:08,927
...at least once a day.

844
01:14:09,294 --> 01:14:12,263
- You do something.
- You go someplace.

845
01:14:12,431 --> 01:14:15,525
- You see somebody.
- Or hear something.

846
01:14:15,701 --> 01:14:20,695
I thought, "If I could go one day
without his name going through my head."

847
01:14:20,873 --> 01:14:22,568
This was months later.

848
01:14:22,741 --> 01:14:25,039
That was after a year.

849
01:14:25,477 --> 01:14:28,708
Then you start to think,
"I should just call him."

850
01:14:28,881 --> 01:14:30,246
I thought of calling.

851
01:14:30,449 --> 01:14:33,543
- To see how he is.
- Find out how she was doing.

852
01:14:33,719 --> 01:14:35,687
Say, hello.

853
01:14:36,455 --> 01:14:39,151
- But I didn't.
- I never did it.

854
01:14:40,125 --> 01:14:43,253
I never figured out what was
wrong with us.

855
01:14:43,428 --> 01:14:46,295
There was never a real problem.

856
01:14:46,465 --> 01:14:48,899
Nothing you could put your finger on.

857
01:14:49,067 --> 01:14:53,094
You know, to this day,
I don't know why we broke up.

858
01:14:53,272 --> 01:14:55,604
I don't know why it didn't work.

859
01:14:55,774 --> 01:14:57,708
We were really stupid.

860
01:14:58,043 --> 01:15:00,409
And I think we were in love.

861
01:15:00,646 --> 01:15:03,274
We were really in love.

862
01:15:04,149 --> 01:15:06,310
Yep. Well, that didn't help.

863
01:15:06,485 --> 01:15:07,918
That made it tougher.

864
01:15:09,321 --> 01:15:11,516
It was harder to let go.

865
01:15:11,690 --> 01:15:17,390
You have this experience of feeling
something so strong, so good.

866
01:15:17,563 --> 01:15:21,897
And as bad as it gets,
you can't forget that.

867
01:15:22,100 --> 01:15:26,264
You always think that tomorrow
it will be the way it was before.

868
01:15:26,672 --> 01:15:30,369
And the memory gets
stronger and stronger...

869
01:15:30,576 --> 01:15:35,240
...and it just makes every day
worse and worse.

870
01:15:35,647 --> 01:15:41,483
I think that whole love thing really
did us in. It screwed everything up.

871
01:15:43,088 --> 01:15:48,219
I woke up one day, and I realized that
I hadn't thought about him for weeks.

872
01:15:48,393 --> 01:15:51,590
I don't know what I did.
I wasn't doing anything.

873
01:15:51,763 --> 01:15:56,462
But whatever I was doing,
I wasn't thinking about him at all.

874
01:16:03,909 --> 01:16:05,672
Hi. George.

875
01:16:05,844 --> 01:16:10,110
I don't know when it was,
but it was just one day.

876
01:16:10,315 --> 01:16:13,910
- It just sort of occurred to me.
- It just dawned on me.

877
01:16:14,086 --> 01:16:17,180
- I sort of realized it.
- I knew it was over.

878
01:16:19,358 --> 01:16:21,121
I sort of realized that...

879
01:16:22,427 --> 01:16:24,088
...it was finished.

880
01:16:24,263 --> 01:16:25,958
It was.

881
01:17:11,910 --> 01:17:13,639
I didn't think it was you.

882
01:17:13,812 --> 01:17:15,006
- No?
- No, I didn't.

883
01:17:15,180 --> 01:17:19,276
- Who did you think it was?
- Not anybody. Just not you.

884
01:17:19,451 --> 01:17:23,114
- Well, you look terrific.
- Thanks.

885
01:17:27,426 --> 01:17:29,621
Oh, my God.

886
01:17:34,099 --> 01:17:36,590
- You don't have to make a fuss.
- I'm not.

887
01:17:38,236 --> 01:17:40,329
Okay, but they are adorable.

888
01:17:40,906 --> 01:17:46,071
My babies, they're adorable.
Steve, look at this. Look at this.

889
01:17:46,244 --> 01:17:48,940
This one is Monica.
I call her Moniquita.

890
01:17:49,114 --> 01:17:52,174
And this is Elizabeth.
There's two of them.

891
01:17:52,351 --> 01:17:54,376
Elizabeth's older.

892
01:17:58,357 --> 01:18:02,817
Anyway, I wanted you to see them.

893
01:18:03,762 --> 01:18:06,060
What does he do, your husband?

894
01:18:06,798 --> 01:18:08,857
Electronics.

895
01:18:09,835 --> 01:18:14,863
- No Renoir? No Gauguin?
- No, electronics. Well, sort of.

896
01:18:15,040 --> 01:18:19,136
He does temperature testing
for computer parts.

897
01:18:19,478 --> 01:18:20,672
He invented it.

898
01:18:22,614 --> 01:18:28,849
It's a way of testing computer parts to
see how much heat they can withstand.

899
01:18:29,454 --> 01:18:31,012
Good.

900
01:18:34,626 --> 01:18:37,220
I know. But he does well.

901
01:18:38,330 --> 01:18:41,822
What about you?
How you doing?

902
01:18:42,667 --> 01:18:45,761
- Me? I'm good.
- You still working?

903
01:18:45,937 --> 01:18:49,634
Yes. I stopped for a year.
For the kids.

904
01:18:50,442 --> 01:18:52,842
And I went back to school.

905
01:18:53,011 --> 01:18:57,243
I got my master's degree.
French literature.

906
01:18:57,449 --> 01:19:01,749
Twentieth century.
The good stuff. That's right.

907
01:19:01,920 --> 01:19:04,013
That's terrific, you know?

908
01:19:04,523 --> 01:19:08,892
- How about you?
- I'm good. I'm great.

909
01:19:09,060 --> 01:19:11,221
- How's the studio?
- Finally moved.

910
01:19:11,396 --> 01:19:14,559
Michael got to me.
We're downtown with the boys.

911
01:19:14,733 --> 01:19:17,531
- Well, that's excellent.
- Thank you.

912
01:19:28,346 --> 01:19:31,543
- Why are you in Santa Barbara?
- A film, <i>Artichoke.</i>

913
01:19:31,716 --> 01:19:34,742
We're very near Castroville here.

914
01:19:35,253 --> 01:19:38,882
- I don't do much still stuff anymore.
- That's terrific.

915
01:19:39,057 --> 01:19:41,048
We do, like...

916
01:19:41,226 --> 01:19:43,751
...educational, documentary stuff.

917
01:19:44,162 --> 01:19:47,563
But I actually did take
some stills recently.

918
01:19:47,732 --> 01:19:50,701
They're very nice.
Would you like to see them?

919
01:19:50,869 --> 01:19:52,734
Yeah, I'd love to see them.

920
01:19:52,904 --> 01:19:53,928
Organically grown.

921
01:19:55,106 --> 01:19:56,198
Your Honor.

922
01:19:58,076 --> 01:20:00,943
- Oh, my God.
- Yep. That's what I said.

923
01:20:01,646 --> 01:20:03,375
Look at him.

924
01:20:04,716 --> 01:20:07,446
- Is it a him?
- No, it's a girl.

925
01:20:11,289 --> 01:20:15,089
- She's just a baby.
- Six months.

926
01:20:15,260 --> 01:20:17,922
- You didn't tell me.
- No, I...

927
01:20:18,096 --> 01:20:21,156
- You didn't tell me either.
- She's beautiful.

928
01:20:21,333 --> 01:20:24,825
- Yeah, you think so?
- I can't believe you did this.

929
01:20:25,003 --> 01:20:28,200
Not hard. I had years of practice.
Some with you.

930
01:20:28,373 --> 01:20:29,738
No, it is hard.

931
01:20:29,908 --> 01:20:34,641
But it's funny.
Because after you do it, you wonder:

932
01:20:34,813 --> 01:20:36,576
"Why did you wait so long?"

933
01:20:38,183 --> 01:20:39,912
That's enough.

934
01:20:40,252 --> 01:20:42,186
It's disgusting anyway.

935
01:20:44,456 --> 01:20:48,859
I don't show them to anybody anymore.
They smile, but they hate it.

936
01:20:51,229 --> 01:20:53,254
Is she good to you?

937
01:20:53,665 --> 01:20:56,225
- The baby?
- The wife.

938
01:20:57,269 --> 01:21:00,204
- Oh, yeah.
- Dumb question.

939
01:21:00,372 --> 01:21:03,603
Not at all.
I know what you mean. But she is, yes.

940
01:21:03,775 --> 01:21:05,072
I used to do that.

941
01:21:05,243 --> 01:21:09,577
I used to ask people
if they were happy or stuff like that.

942
01:21:09,748 --> 01:21:13,980
I don't do it anymore. It's stupid,
and it's none of my business.

943
01:21:15,253 --> 01:21:17,278
Are you happy?

944
01:21:17,722 --> 01:21:20,555
Yeah, I am. I am happy.

945
01:21:21,159 --> 01:21:23,024
That's great.

946
01:21:23,194 --> 01:21:27,187
I worry a lot. I think maybe
I should have been smarter.

947
01:21:27,365 --> 01:21:30,334
I think I did it all wrong.
I should have...

948
01:21:31,670 --> 01:21:36,369
I don't know if I can give them
what they need. You know?

949
01:21:36,641 --> 01:21:38,302
Sometimes I think...

950
01:21:38,476 --> 01:21:43,607
...I don't even know if I know what
they need. That's okay, really...

951
01:21:43,782 --> 01:21:45,716
...because I enjoy trying.

952
01:21:46,251 --> 01:21:49,379
Sometimes I think it's working.
Sometimes not.

953
01:21:49,554 --> 01:21:54,457
- Sometimes it's best not to think.
- Right. Just do it.

954
01:21:55,126 --> 01:21:59,460
Funny, isn't it? You know?
I feel more alone now.

955
01:22:04,402 --> 01:22:06,529
That surprised me.

956
01:22:07,005 --> 01:22:11,066
That really did.
There's so much more going on.

957
01:22:11,242 --> 01:22:14,803
People and work and the baby,
and it's all good.

958
01:22:15,347 --> 01:22:17,815
But I still feel more alone.

959
01:22:18,717 --> 01:22:22,175
Well, it doesn't get any easier.

960
01:22:56,221 --> 01:22:58,155
Listen...

961
01:22:59,591 --> 01:23:01,616
...it's getting late.

962
01:23:01,793 --> 01:23:04,057
Yeah, I better get moving.

963
01:23:07,499 --> 01:23:09,933
Yeah, I got an early flight.

964
01:23:12,337 --> 01:23:15,602
- You're leaving tomorrow?
- Yeah.

965
01:23:21,913 --> 01:23:24,177
Well, it was good to see you.

966
01:23:28,186 --> 01:23:30,654
It was good to see you too.

967
01:23:32,424 --> 01:23:35,325
I'm gonna have the worst hangover.

968
01:23:39,497 --> 01:23:41,226
I better go, huh?

969
01:23:50,475 --> 01:23:51,999
Yeah.

970
01:24:53,505 --> 01:24:58,238
<i>So do you have any good or bad</i>
<i>breakup stories you can tell?</i>

971
01:24:58,409 --> 01:25:00,240
<i>The lowest...</i>

972
01:25:00,512 --> 01:25:03,538
<i>... would have been the guy</i>
<i>right before him...</i>

973
01:25:03,715 --> 01:25:07,981
<i>... who asked me to marry him</i>
<i>and then went away...</i>

974
01:25:08,153 --> 01:25:10,144
<i>... and wanted me to visit him.</i>

975
01:25:10,321 --> 01:25:14,781
<i>I called him to firm up the details,</i>
<i>and a woman answered the phone.</i>

976
01:25:14,959 --> 01:25:18,520
<i>And this was at midnight,</i>
<i>and she tried to wake him up.</i>

977
01:25:18,696 --> 01:25:22,564
<i>He was in a drunken stupor</i>
<i>and could not be awakened.</i>

978
01:25:22,734 --> 01:25:26,101
<i>He called the next day and said,</i>
<i>"Honey, I'm sorry. "</i>

979
01:25:26,271 --> 01:25:29,297
<i>I said, "You asked me to marry you.</i>

980
01:25:29,474 --> 01:25:33,240
<i>What were you doing with a woman</i>
<i>after proposing to me?"</i>

981
01:25:33,411 --> 01:25:36,903
<i>And he said,</i>
<i>"Darling, we're not married yet. "</i>

982
01:25:37,081 --> 01:25:40,050
<i>The worst breakup I ever had</i>
<i>took two years.</i>

983
01:25:40,218 --> 01:25:43,813
<i>I moved across the country,</i>
<i>3000 miles away.</i>

984
01:25:43,988 --> 01:25:49,324
<i>He followed me, and when he left,</i>
<i>we were back together.</i>

985
01:25:49,494 --> 01:25:54,591
<i>But by the time he made it to New York,</i>
<i>we had somehow broken up again.</i>

986
01:25:54,766 --> 01:25:56,461
<i>He got a girl pregnant.</i>

987
01:25:56,634 --> 01:25:59,364
<i>I'm always...</i>
<i>Spread my wings and fly.</i>

988
01:25:59,537 --> 01:26:04,839
<i>Does it every time. And even then,</i>

989
