01:26:14,984 --> 01:26:17,620
BONE: It's me, it's me, it's me.

1218
01:26:17,653 --> 01:26:19,488
Come on,
we got to get out of here.

1219
01:26:19,521 --> 01:26:21,389
We got to get out of here.
Come on.

Taking you to see
my little homegirl.

She works at USC Medical Center,
patch you up.

1222
01:26:41,376 --> 01:26:42,912
No questions asked.

1223
01:26:51,020 --> 01:26:53,823
Pull over.
I got to talk to someone.

WIZARD: Congratulations.
You did it.

1228
01:27:38,400 --> 01:27:41,804
There were two,
and now there is one.

1229
01:27:41,838 --> 01:27:43,606
How do you know?

1230
01:27:43,639 --> 01:27:46,441
I got the devil on my shoulder
here whispering in my ear.

1231
01:27:48,510 --> 01:27:51,647
It came for you and you beat it.

1232
01:27:51,681 --> 01:27:53,515
Just like I did in my day.

1233
01:27:55,818 --> 01:28:00,089
You saved me, <i>mijo.</i>
You saved me.

1234
01:28:05,761 --> 01:28:08,130
Now you can stand
under your own sky.

1235
01:28:11,033 --> 01:28:13,501
This pain you feel will go away.

1236
01:28:15,805 --> 01:28:18,540
But the power...

1237
01:28:18,573 --> 01:28:20,610
the power is forever.

1238
01:28:20,643 --> 01:28:24,013

1240
01:28:31,687 --> 01:28:36,692
<i>Mijo,</i> I love you.

1241
01:28:36,726 --> 01:28:38,127
Why are you saying that?

1242
01:28:40,196 --> 01:28:42,765
Why now?

1243
01:28:42,798 --> 01:28:45,768
You never said you loved me.

1244
01:28:45,801 --> 01:28:48,671
WIZARD: 'Cause I didn't know
who you are.

1245
01:28:48,704 --> 01:28:50,740
Now I know.

1246
01:28:54,542 --> 01:28:58,748
You and me, we're the same.

1247
01:29:01,117 --> 01:29:04,954
You're a king.

1248
01:29:04,987 --> 01:29:06,889
I don't want it.

1249
01:29:09,158 --> 01:29:17,066
I don't want it, Dad.

1250
01:29:17,099 --> 01:29:18,834
It wants you.

1251
01:29:22,805 --> 01:29:25,641
No.

1252
01:29:25,675 --> 01:29:28,543
No, I don't want that.

1253
01:30:04,313 --> 01:30:06,514
Forgive me.
