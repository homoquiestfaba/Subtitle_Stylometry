<i>Welcome back</i>

<i>I'm Jack black.</i>

17

<i>Before the break, we were talking
to Maggie from magnolia.</i>

18
00:02:32,971 --> 00:02:35,204
<i>So, let me</i>
<i>get this straight, Maggie.</i>

19
00:02:35,206 --> 00:02:36,672
<i>From an evolutionary</i>
<i>point of view,</i>

20
00:02:36,674 --> 00:02:41,009
<i>men have basically outserved their
function as hunter/providers,</i>

21
00:02:41,011 --> 00:02:41,776
<i>and according to you,</i>

22
00:02:41,778 --> 00:02:44,578
<i>testosterone is going</i>
<i>to destroy the world?</i>

23
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:45,912
<i>Look, all I'm saying is</i>

24
00:02:45,914 --> 00:02:50,182
<i>after 5 marriages, I think I know
something about men, you know.</i>

25

Ditz.

26
00:02:50,751 --> 00:02:53,952
<i>I mean, there is a difference
between men and women.</i>

27
00:02:53,954 --> 00:02:54,652
Duh!

28
00:02:54,654 --> 00:02:55,586
<i>So you're saying...</i>

29
00:02:55,588 --> 00:02:57,721
<i>What I'm saying is that</i>
<i>even when we're kids</i>

30
00:02:57,723 --> 00:03:00,957
<i>girls are nurturers, boys
are aggressors, that's all.</i>

31
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:04,860
<i>Girls want to play with dolls,</i>
<i>and boys want to play with...</i>

32
00:03:04,862 --> 00:03:05,760
Themselves? <i>Guns.</i>

33
00:03:05,762 --> 00:03:07,628
<i>Men are what's wrong</i>

<i>Well, ma'am,</i>
<i>speaking as Jack black,</i>

35
00:03:10,165 --> 00:03:11,264
<i>your radio therapist,</i>

36
00:03:11,266 --> 00:03:13,599
<i>I have just 2 words of advice:</i>

37
00:03:13,601 --> 00:03:15,534
Stop whining! <i>Stop whining!</i>

38
00:03:15,536 --> 00:03:16,801
Next caller.

39
00:03:16,803 --> 00:03:17,368
<i>Next caller.</i>

40
00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:19,770
<i>I don't know how you can</i>
<i>call yourself a therapist</i>

41
00:03:19,772 --> 00:03:21,571
<i>when you don't believe</i>
<i>people should talk</i>

42
00:03:21,573 --> 00:03:23,372
<i>about their problems.</i>
<i>Isn't modern therapy...</i>

43
00:03:23,374 --> 00:03:25,374
hey, modern therapy
is the problem.

44
00:03:25,376 --> 00:03:29,044
People wallowing in their own
pathetic guilt at $100 an hour

45
00:03:29,046 --> 00:03:30,111
instead of just
getting on with it.

46
00:03:30,113 --> 00:03:33,214
If more people listened to me,
fewer people would listen to me.

47
00:03:33,216 --> 00:03:35,950
<i>But the work I've done</i>
<i>on my inner child</i>

48
00:03:35,952 --> 00:03:36,784
<i>has really helped...</i>

49
00:03:36,786 --> 00:03:40,554

for your inner child:

50
00:03:40,556 --> 00:03:42,155
Grow up!

52
00:03:44,058 --> 00:03:46,024
<i>Yeah, hi.</i>

00:03:46,026 --> 00:03:46,958
<i>Go ahead, caller.</i>

54
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:50,361
<i>I need you to help me.</i>
<i>To explain someone to me.</i>

55
00:03:51,130 --> 00:03:54,464
Ashley, do you know
what time it is?

56
00:03:56,167 --> 00:03:57,132
<i>Go ahead, bubba.</i>

57
00:03:57,134 --> 00:03:59,968
<i>Yeah, I just wanted</i>
<i>to call and say</i>

58
00:03:59,970 --> 00:04:01,402
<i>that your show</i>
<i>really offends me.</i>

59

<i>Where're you calling from?</i>

60
00:04:03,305 --> 00:04:04,937
<i>I'm at home.</i>

61
00:04:04,939 --> 00:04:07,172
<i>Someone got a gun to your head?</i>

62
00:04:07,174 --> 00:04:07,672
<i>No.</i>

63
00:04:07,674 --> 00:04:10,241
<i>Then change the station! Next!</i>

64
00:04:10,243 --> 00:04:11,675
<i>Yeah, dude.</i>

65
00:04:11,677 --> 00:04:12,475
<i>Go ahead.</i>

66
00:04:12,477 --> 00:04:14,477

<i>Hello, Rochelle from...</i>

73
00:04:23,551 --> 00:04:24,416
Ashley, honey.

74
00:04:24,418 --> 00:04:26,451
You wanna give me a hand
with the groceries?

75
00:04:26,453 --> 00:04:28,820
And please don't
listen to that garbage.

76
00:04:28,822 --> 00:04:31,255
But it's daddy's show.

77
00:04:31,257 --> 00:04:32,689
I know.

78
00:04:35,226 --> 00:04:37,659
Joshua, when I said
grab a bag out of the car,

79
00:04:37,661 --> 00:04:40,828
I meant something a bit bigger.

80
00:04:44,333 --> 00:04:47,867
Ok, guys, let's go. Your father's
gonna be here any minute.

81
00:04:47,869 --> 00:04:50,302
<i>I just have 2 words</i>
<i>of advice for you:</i>

82
00:04:50,304 --> 00:04:53,071
Stop whining!

<i>Next caller.</i>

84
00:05:04,817 --> 00:05:08,618
Hey, don't worry.
He'll be here.

85
00:05:20,464 --> 00:05:22,464
Dad!

86
00:05:24,634 --> 00:05:25,799
Hi, Joshua. Dad.

87
00:05:25,801 --> 00:05:29,235
You guys ready to cruise? Hmm?

88
00:05:38,346 --> 00:05:41,380
What's with
this research stuff?

89
00:05:41,382 --> 00:05:42,814
They've been
looking forward to this.

90
00:05:42,816 --> 00:05:46,384
They haven't spent quality time
with you since last summer.

91
00:05:46,386 --> 00:05:47,718
It won't be a problem.

92
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:49,086
Right.

93
00:05:49,354 --> 00:05:51,554
Come here. I love you guys.

94
00:05:51,556 --> 00:05:55,357
You have a good time, ok?
Come here.

95
00:05:59,096 --> 00:06:01,496
"Interstate 5."

96
00:06:02,866 --> 00:06:05,266
"Exit 176."

97
00:06:07,336 --> 00:06:09,502
"Exit 177."

98
00:06:09,504 --> 00:06:12,838
"U.S.-Canada customs. 5 Miles."

99
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:14,673
How long is this ride, dad?

100
00:06:14,675 --> 00:06:15,940
Just a second, Josh.

101
00:06:15,942 --> 00:06:17,641
Yeah, Albert.
You have my numbers, right?

102
00:06:17,643 --> 00:06:22,912
You can reach me on my cell, or if
that's busy, fax me in the car.

103
00:06:37,194 --> 00:06:39,661
"Exit 301."

104
00:06:39,663 --> 00:06:42,363
"Watch for falling rock."

105
00:06:43,432 --> 00:06:47,400
"Welcome to glenorky,
home of orky."

106
00:06:47,902 --> 00:06:49,935
It's about time.

107
00:06:51,505 --> 00:06:52,237
Dad, who's orky?

108
00:06:52,239 --> 00:06:56,674
I know it is only 4 weeks, Albert, but
I'll get it done. You have my word.

109
00:06:57,843 --> 00:06:58,374
Dad?

110
00:06:58,376 --> 00:07:02,745
Honey, can you get that, please?
It's somewhere in the back.

111
00:07:03,547 --> 00:07:06,281
They can give you
brain cancer, you know.

112
00:07:07,751 --> 00:07:11,819
Well, you can call me then.
He has my numbers, right?

113
00:07:11,821 --> 00:07:13,554
Whoa! Major road kill.

114
00:07:13,556 --> 00:07:15,822
Dad, I got a close-up
using the image...

115
00:07:15,824 --> 00:07:19,692
2 words of advice, Al: Relax.

116
00:07:20,928 --> 00:07:22,260
Did you say something, honey?

117
00:07:22,262 --> 00:07:24,428
I just wanted to know
who orky was.

118
00:07:24,430 --> 00:07:25,862
He's a stupid
tourist attraction.

119
00:07:25,864 --> 00:07:27,897
Like the loch ness monster,
o vacant one.

120
00:07:27,899 --> 00:07:30,032
Am I the only one
who hears that?

121
00:07:30,034 --> 00:07:32,868
All I want to know
is if he's real or not?

122
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:33,835
What, honey?

123
00:07:33,837 --> 00:07:34,936
That thing. Orky.

124
00:07:34,938 --> 00:07:37,605
Probably some
ancient Indian myth.

125
00:07:37,607 --> 00:07:40,608
You know,
some aboriginal deity.

126
00:07:42,979 --> 00:07:45,713
Space, the final frontier.

127
00:07:46,048 --> 00:07:48,548
Josh, get a life.

128
00:07:50,652 --> 00:07:54,553
Dad, I bet
I could drive this thing.

129
00:08:05,630 --> 00:08:08,597
Dad. One second.

130
00:08:15,939 --> 00:08:18,139
Where are we?

131
00:08:18,141 --> 00:08:21,475
I don't know.
We passed a bridge.

132
00:08:22,144 --> 00:08:24,244
Left at the dairy queen?

133
00:08:25,714 --> 00:08:28,114
I don't know. It's your map!

134
00:08:46,098 --> 00:08:50,233
Ok, let's get started.
Hi, everyone.

135
00:08:50,235 --> 00:08:51,534
Hi, Dr. Bell.

136
00:08:51,536 --> 00:08:56,272
Today we have a new recruit.
Frank has come to us for help.

137
00:08:56,274 --> 00:09:00,242
Frank, do you want to tell
the others what you told me?

138
00:09:01,245 --> 00:09:02,677
Uh.

139
00:09:03,312 --> 00:09:04,577
Hi.

140
00:09:04,579 --> 00:09:06,779
Um, I'm, uh...

141
00:09:08,048 --> 00:09:08,579
Bob.

142
00:09:08,581 --> 00:09:10,614
Hi, Bob.

143
00:09:10,616 --> 00:09:11,381
Hi, Bob.

144
00:09:11,383 --> 00:09:15,351
Frank, it's ok
to use your real name here.

145
00:09:19,157 --> 00:09:20,990
Oh, all right.

146
00:09:21,525 --> 00:09:22,323
I'm Frank.

147
00:09:22,325 --> 00:09:23,957
Hi, Frank.

148
00:09:23,959 --> 00:09:26,392
- Hi, Frank.
- Hi.

149
00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:29,727
And, uh, my body was

150
00:09:31,030 --> 00:09:33,263
inhabited by.

151
00:09:38,536 --> 00:09:39,468
Orky.

152
00:09:39,470 --> 00:09:41,603
Oh, God.
See, now we're into it.

153
00:09:41,605 --> 00:09:42,403
Ok, here we go.

154
00:09:42,405 --> 00:09:44,938
I told you about orky, huh?

155
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:46,739
Uh, he was in my body.

156
00:09:46,741 --> 00:09:48,774
Did you get
to go into his cave?

157
00:09:48,776 --> 00:09:50,041
He was you
and you were him, right?

158
00:09:50,043 --> 00:09:52,510
This isn't happening.
I'm not hearing this.

159
00:09:52,512 --> 00:09:56,580
I don't believe in monsters
'cause monsters don't exist.

160
00:09:56,582 --> 00:09:57,380
In his cave...

161
00:09:57,382 --> 00:10:00,883
gentlemen. Gentlemen.
Gentlemen!

162
00:10:01,385 --> 00:10:02,951
Right.

163
00:10:05,655 --> 00:10:06,920
Go ahead, Frank.

164
00:10:06,922 --> 00:10:11,824
Well, at first,
I... I was scared.

165
00:10:13,661 --> 00:10:15,594
And then

166
00:10:16,964 --> 00:10:18,630
it was amazing.

167
00:10:21,368 --> 00:10:24,268
I could actually breathe
underwater.

168
00:10:24,270 --> 00:10:26,536
And when you came to, you
were building a sandcastle?

169
00:10:26,538 --> 00:10:29,105
I don't believe in monsters,
'cause monsters don't exist.

170
00:10:29,107 --> 00:10:32,408
It didn't inhabit my body,
I didn't become a fish.

171
00:10:32,410 --> 00:10:35,978
Gentlemen. Gentlemen.
Gent-gentlemen!

172
00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:38,146
Dad, is this it?

173
00:10:38,148 --> 00:10:42,016
Looks like some demented tepee
or something.

174
00:10:42,018 --> 00:10:45,386
We have a dock. Our own dock.

175
00:10:47,857 --> 00:10:50,123
This is great!

176
00:11:03,905 --> 00:11:05,804
Dad, come look!

177
00:11:12,579 --> 00:11:14,445
Water.

178
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:16,779
Uncarbonated.

179
00:11:16,914 --> 00:11:19,447
It's beautiful, isn't it?

180
00:11:20,249 --> 00:11:22,582
You're just like your mother.

181
00:11:22,584 --> 00:11:26,719
No, that's... that's good.
That's good.

182
00:11:27,154 --> 00:11:29,921
Want to race to the beach?

183
00:11:31,390 --> 00:11:32,822
On your marks, get...

184
00:11:32,824 --> 00:11:34,356
wait, wait.

185
00:11:37,894 --> 00:11:38,592
Hello.

186
00:11:44,566 --> 00:11:46,032
Hello.

187
00:12:04,885 --> 00:12:07,752
¶

188
00:12:18,898 --> 00:12:20,397
Hi.

189
00:12:23,335 --> 00:12:25,902
¶

190
00:12:35,813 --> 00:12:39,281
"Dad's easter. June 20th."

191
00:12:43,687 --> 00:12:47,855
I hate to tell you this, but I don't
think there's a cassette player.

192
00:12:47,857 --> 00:12:51,124
That's ok,
I can hear them in my head.

193
00:12:55,997 --> 00:12:58,097
I just locked that.

194
00:12:58,466 --> 00:13:00,098
Yeah.

195
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:01,532
Leave it locked!

196
00:13:01,534 --> 00:13:02,432
Chicken. Chicken.

197
00:13:02,434 --> 00:13:05,735
I'm not chicken,
just close the damn window!

198
00:13:05,737 --> 00:13:07,470
What are you chicken of?

199
00:13:07,472 --> 00:13:08,904
Josh!

200
00:13:10,574 --> 00:13:12,574
What is going on?

201
00:13:14,411 --> 00:13:15,209
Hormones.

202
00:13:15,211 --> 00:13:18,979
I asked him to close the window,
and he called me a chicken.

203
00:13:18,981 --> 00:13:22,749
You're 2 rational human
beings, I've got work to do.

204
00:13:22,751 --> 00:13:25,451
3 words: Deal with it.

205
00:14:18,367 --> 00:14:19,799
Huh!

206
00:16:23,556 --> 00:16:26,623
Daddy! Hey, dad!

207
00:16:28,259 --> 00:16:30,058
Daddy!

208
00:16:31,161 --> 00:16:32,493
Dad!

209
00:16:33,329 --> 00:16:34,795
Dad!

210
00:16:35,164 --> 00:16:38,932
The monster! He's real!
He ate my cookies.

211
00:16:38,934 --> 00:16:40,767
You mean,
you lost your cookies.

212
00:16:42,036 --> 00:16:43,402
Dad!

213
00:16:46,540 --> 00:16:52,210
Greetings! I'm Joe pickled
trout, your property manager.

214
00:16:52,212 --> 00:16:55,046
Dad! Orky, he ate my cookies!

215
00:16:55,048 --> 00:16:58,549
Don't worry about it, honey.
Get you some more.

216
00:16:59,218 --> 00:17:01,051
Morning.

217
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:04,854
It's really
my Uncle kipper's property.

218
00:17:05,223 --> 00:17:08,023
He lives in the main house,
but he's past the day.

219
00:17:08,025 --> 00:17:10,091
About 3 fries short
of a happy meal.

220
00:17:10,093 --> 00:17:12,526
We keep him sedated.

221
00:17:12,528 --> 00:17:14,427
I bet I could drive this.

222
00:17:14,429 --> 00:17:16,629
How about this?

223
00:17:17,798 --> 00:17:20,565
Only $500 extra for the month.

224
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:23,934
I could definitely drive that!

225
00:17:26,371 --> 00:17:28,037
Aw, c'mon, dad!

226
00:17:28,039 --> 00:17:29,938
Anyone for a tour?

227
00:17:30,206 --> 00:17:32,239
It's on the house.

228
00:17:35,978 --> 00:17:38,745
There hasn't been
a sighting since '89,

229
00:17:38,747 --> 00:17:39,512
so business is kinda slow.

230
00:17:39,514 --> 00:17:43,048
How long has this orky thing
been a tourist attraction?

231
00:17:43,050 --> 00:17:44,115
Only since I took over.

232
00:17:44,117 --> 00:17:47,318
My Uncle kipper's considered
himself a bit of a purist.

233
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:48,319
Hey, Joe!

234
00:17:48,321 --> 00:17:49,687
Hey, Bobby. Hey, Mary Elle.

235
00:17:49,689 --> 00:17:53,323
Now, he thinks
I've somehow gone commercial.

236
00:17:53,658 --> 00:17:56,892
Here we are: Orky central.

237
00:18:03,865 --> 00:18:05,731
Big bucks
scientific expedition.

238
00:18:05,733 --> 00:18:09,468
The Japanese have developed
this new, super hi-tech radar

239
00:18:09,470 --> 00:18:10,302
that can sweep the entire lake.

240
00:18:10,304 --> 00:18:15,740
They just might find old orky, unless
he pulls one of his special tricks.

241
00:18:16,175 --> 00:18:16,806
Tricks?

242
00:18:16,808 --> 00:18:22,077
Native legend has it that he can
change himself into another animal.

243
00:18:22,379 --> 00:18:23,978
Even a human being.

244
00:18:23,980 --> 00:18:27,081
That's why
he's never been caught.

245
00:18:30,219 --> 00:18:32,452
Bet I could drive that.

246
00:18:32,620 --> 00:18:35,120
What would they do
if they found him?

247
00:18:35,122 --> 00:18:37,989
Probably turn him
into a movie star.

248
00:18:37,991 --> 00:18:41,392
More like giant Sushi.
Slice 'n' dice, baby.

249
00:18:41,394 --> 00:18:44,528
Nah, he's considered
a sacred creature in Japan.

250
00:18:44,530 --> 00:18:49,533
They wouldn't harm him. They just
want to get a closer look at him.

251
00:18:49,535 --> 00:18:51,735
Who are those one-armed dudes?

252
00:18:51,837 --> 00:18:53,503
They're the Hardy brothers.

253
00:18:53,505 --> 00:18:55,705
They were working on the
docks at the mill one night,

254
00:18:55,707 --> 00:19:00,076
when orky leapt right out of the lake
and took an arm off each of them.

255
00:19:00,078 --> 00:19:02,845
Every time a new expedition
comes to town,

256
00:19:02,847 --> 00:19:04,379
they follow right behind them,

257
00:19:04,381 --> 00:19:08,449
waiting for the right moment
to get revenge.

258
00:19:09,185 --> 00:19:11,718
They're out for blood.

259
00:19:14,489 --> 00:19:17,356
Dad, could I ask you something?

260
00:19:17,358 --> 00:19:19,524
Hold on, honey.

261
00:19:22,628 --> 00:19:24,861
Mmm-mmm. Too sweet.

262
00:19:26,464 --> 00:19:28,730
Why don't you go out and play?

263
00:19:28,732 --> 00:19:31,633
There's nothing to do here.

264
00:19:31,635 --> 00:19:33,701
Use your imagination.

265
00:19:34,403 --> 00:19:39,038
Can I take the boat out and
go look for Ashley's monster?

266
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:41,173
Could be worth millions.

267
00:19:41,175 --> 00:19:43,875
You know, for college.

268
00:19:45,478 --> 00:19:47,077
Later.

269
00:19:47,379 --> 00:19:50,780
Come on, guys,
I got work to do.

270
00:19:52,250 --> 00:19:55,417
Go on. Get out of here,
will you?

271
00:20:05,562 --> 00:20:08,296
Josh, can we go back now?

272
00:20:10,133 --> 00:20:12,133
In a sec, ash.

273
00:20:15,538 --> 00:20:18,372
I'm doin' a man thing here.

274
00:20:19,508 --> 00:20:22,242
Staring death in the face.

275
00:20:22,377 --> 00:20:24,176
Stuff like that.

276
00:21:06,919 --> 00:21:10,020
God, Ashley, get a grip!

277
00:21:29,872 --> 00:21:31,371
Phew!

278
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:33,606
Stinks!

279
00:21:46,721 --> 00:21:49,421
I knew it! I knew it!

280
00:21:52,959 --> 00:21:56,727
I just called
to say we arrived safely.

281
00:21:56,729 --> 00:22:00,397
Why do we always
have to get into this?

282
00:22:02,234 --> 00:22:05,902
Of course, I wanna
spend time with her.

283
00:22:07,071 --> 00:22:08,870
Oh, yeah, sure!
That's right, Beth.

284
00:22:08,872 --> 00:22:14,375
Just because I... hey, I took 'em
on this stupid vacation, didn't I?

285
00:22:15,411 --> 00:22:17,611
What more do you want?

286
00:22:57,517 --> 00:23:00,150
<i>That color becomes you.</i>

287
00:23:00,152 --> 00:23:01,784
<i>You park here often?</i>

288
00:23:05,256 --> 00:23:07,155
Sorry, it's a new toy.

289
00:23:07,157 --> 00:23:10,424
One of these
talking security systems.

290
00:23:11,226 --> 00:23:13,593
Hi. Jack black.

291
00:23:13,828 --> 00:23:15,494
Wanda bell.

292
00:23:15,496 --> 00:23:17,696
So do you park here often?

293
00:23:18,498 --> 00:23:22,066
Uh, I have a patient here.
Sedatives.

294
00:23:22,068 --> 00:23:23,434
Ah, you're a doctor.

295
00:23:23,436 --> 00:23:27,438
Well, actually,
I'm a psychiatrist.

296
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:29,539
Really?

297
00:23:29,541 --> 00:23:32,341
That makes us colleagues.

298
00:23:33,344 --> 00:23:34,710
You're a psychiatrist?

299
00:23:34,712 --> 00:23:36,178
Mmm-hmm.

300
00:23:38,182 --> 00:23:41,550
How could anyone
be neurotic up here?

301
00:23:44,087 --> 00:23:46,187
Can I help you with that?

302
00:23:58,800 --> 00:23:59,899
You actually get business?

303
00:23:59,901 --> 00:24:03,636
I escaped the city figuring that I'd
be practicing general medicine,

304
00:24:03,638 --> 00:24:06,105
but when I got here,
I discovered a group of men

305
00:24:06,107 --> 00:24:07,873
who all have
an identical psychosis.

306
00:24:07,875 --> 00:24:11,142
What? Like a cult? End of
the world sort of thing?

307
00:24:11,144 --> 00:24:16,013
No, they all believe they've been
inhabited by a lake monster.

308
00:24:20,119 --> 00:24:21,618
Sorry.

309
00:24:22,721 --> 00:24:28,024
There's nothing I want more than
to help them get well again.

310
00:25:28,182 --> 00:25:30,115
Who's there?

311
00:25:38,924 --> 00:25:42,959
I know that smell.
It's you, isn't it?

312
00:25:59,275 --> 00:26:01,708
And catrina, who's my very
best friend at school,

313
00:26:01,710 --> 00:26:03,643
well, her mom's
always forgetting her keys.

314
00:26:03,645 --> 00:26:07,213
And this one time, we were at a softball
game, and she didn't have them,

315
00:26:07,215 --> 00:26:10,983
so we had to use my brother's
bat to break the window.

316
00:26:14,855 --> 00:26:16,120
No.

317
00:26:16,122 --> 00:26:19,456
I don't remember
what she was wearing.

318
00:26:19,458 --> 00:26:22,525
God! Can't you just find her?

319
00:26:25,496 --> 00:26:27,729
Uh, missing child?

320
00:26:28,765 --> 00:26:30,464
Mmm-mmm.

321
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:33,133
That's not mine.

322
00:26:33,702 --> 00:26:36,002
Oh, no, no. He's mine.

323
00:26:36,004 --> 00:26:39,905
Uh, I need a piece
of your daughter's clothing.

324
00:26:43,176 --> 00:26:45,109
For my dog.

325
00:27:22,681 --> 00:27:27,650
And the reason I could tell it was you
was because you have really bad breath.

326
00:27:27,652 --> 00:27:29,018
No offense.

327
00:27:29,020 --> 00:27:33,122
Mom says you get bad breath
when you're sick.

328
00:27:33,357 --> 00:27:35,156
Are you sick?

329
00:27:39,328 --> 00:27:42,495
Well, I'm only gonna
give you one more of these,

330
00:27:42,497 --> 00:27:45,965
'cause if you are, I don't
want you getting any sicker.

331
00:27:45,967 --> 00:27:48,600
None of us could breathe.

332
00:28:05,083 --> 00:28:07,450
Guess I better find a place
to sleep.

333
00:28:07,452 --> 00:28:11,887
Safe from wild animals
and highway perverts.

334
00:28:12,956 --> 00:28:14,822
Ashley!

335
00:28:17,993 --> 00:28:19,892
Ashley!

336
00:28:51,689 --> 00:28:54,956
It's ok. I know what I'm doing.

337
00:28:56,693 --> 00:28:58,626
Ashley!

338
00:29:01,063 --> 00:29:02,595
Ashley!

339
00:29:15,239 --> 00:29:16,838
Please. Hold on.

340
00:29:38,792 --> 00:29:41,292
Ashley!

341
00:29:51,937 --> 00:29:53,670
Ashley?

342
00:29:55,407 --> 00:29:56,906
Oh, my God!

343
00:30:01,412 --> 00:30:03,044
Help!

344
00:30:07,150 --> 00:30:10,417
Help! Please.

345
00:30:40,746 --> 00:30:43,847
I wasn't chasing monsters.

346
00:30:47,953 --> 00:30:49,919
He'll be ok, ash.

347
00:30:53,291 --> 00:30:55,724
There you are. Why don't you
come to the kitchen?

348
00:30:55,726 --> 00:31:00,295
I'll make you some grapefruit
and free-range eggs.

349
00:31:01,965 --> 00:31:03,864
Is he gonna die?

350
00:31:04,132 --> 00:31:05,564
Oh, no, honey.

351
00:31:05,566 --> 00:31:10,435
No. He's just had a mild
craniocerebral trauma.

352
00:31:10,437 --> 00:31:11,769
A concussion.

353
00:31:11,771 --> 00:31:13,604
When will he get better?

354
00:31:15,975 --> 00:31:18,208
Dad! Ashley?

355
00:31:18,743 --> 00:31:19,208
Ashley?

356
00:31:19,210 --> 00:31:21,710
She's right here,
she's all right.

357
00:31:21,712 --> 00:31:23,011
Ashley?

358
00:31:23,013 --> 00:31:24,345
Dad!

359
00:31:30,887 --> 00:31:31,785
Ashley, you're all right.

360
00:31:31,787 --> 00:31:35,021
She's fine. Everybody's fine.

361
00:31:38,126 --> 00:31:39,558
I thought...

362
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:40,825
Are... are you ok, dad?

363
00:31:40,827 --> 00:31:43,828
Yeah, yeah. You're not hurt.

364
00:31:45,531 --> 00:31:46,930
Dad, you saved me.

365
00:31:46,932 --> 00:31:49,465
If you hadn't...
if you hadn't catched me...

366
00:31:49,467 --> 00:31:54,203
Kids. Kids, let's give him
a chance to rest. Ok?

367
00:31:54,205 --> 00:31:56,572
He'll be home very soon.

368
00:31:56,874 --> 00:31:58,506
Jack, open your eye for me.

369
00:31:58,508 --> 00:32:01,375
Whoa. Whoa. Keep it open.

370
00:32:02,611 --> 00:32:05,378
I had the weirdest dream.

371
00:32:07,081 --> 00:32:08,647
Ooh!

372
00:32:14,053 --> 00:32:16,420
You're gonna die of melanoma.

373
00:32:16,422 --> 00:32:19,189
I'm gonna die of boredom.

374
00:32:33,705 --> 00:32:35,337
Hey!

375
00:32:35,472 --> 00:32:38,439
You guys wanna have some fun?

376
00:32:39,274 --> 00:32:43,276
Don't you guys want a turn?
Be a lot faster.

377
00:32:43,878 --> 00:32:46,178
Wouldn't it be faster
just to take a plane?

378
00:32:46,180 --> 00:32:49,648
Nah! This is the only way
to get to China.

379
00:32:49,650 --> 00:32:54,953
I used to try this all the time
by myself when I was a kid,

380
00:32:55,021 --> 00:32:59,123
but I could never get there
because I always had to do it

381
00:32:59,125 --> 00:33:00,724
myself.

382
00:33:01,126 --> 00:33:02,058
Yeah, I bet.

383
00:33:02,060 --> 00:33:04,593
My dad never helped.

384
00:33:04,595 --> 00:33:06,695
He was too...

385
00:33:21,777 --> 00:33:24,611
Dad, I thought you said you
didn't remember your childhood.

386
00:33:24,613 --> 00:33:28,181
That it was locked in the
deepest recesses of your mind.

387
00:33:52,072 --> 00:33:55,840
It's ok, dad.
I'll help you dig to China.

388
00:34:03,047 --> 00:34:03,445
Dad!

389
00:34:03,447 --> 00:34:08,149
Isn't it time we did that father-son
bonding thing or something?

390
00:34:09,252 --> 00:34:09,717
Huh?

391
00:34:09,719 --> 00:34:11,385
Can't we do something normal?

392
00:34:11,387 --> 00:34:13,720
Like take this puppy
out for a spin?

393
00:34:13,722 --> 00:34:16,923
I'm supposed to wanna do
that kind of thing at my age.

394
00:34:16,925 --> 00:34:19,191
It's a teen thing.

395
00:34:19,426 --> 00:34:20,491
Too noisy.

396
00:34:20,493 --> 00:34:24,027
Besides, we must be
gettin' close.

397
00:34:24,029 --> 00:34:26,529
Yup! Shouldn't be long now.

398
00:34:26,531 --> 00:34:29,565
Come on, dad. You promised.

399
00:34:30,935 --> 00:34:32,067
Huh?

400
00:34:32,069 --> 00:34:34,235
This is bullshit!

401
00:34:35,538 --> 00:34:37,838
This place sucks!

402
00:34:41,543 --> 00:34:43,910
Did I say somethin'?

403
00:34:44,779 --> 00:34:48,814
What are we gonna do
with all this sand?

404
00:34:50,751 --> 00:34:53,418
There was nothing
little Jackie wanted more

405
00:34:53,420 --> 00:34:56,854
than to be a knight
at king Arthur's round table.

406
00:34:56,856 --> 00:34:58,422
But everyone just said,

407
00:34:58,991 --> 00:35:02,392
"It'll never happen, pal.
You're too puny."

408
00:35:02,394 --> 00:35:05,862
Anyway, Jackie knew that
king Arthur's knights

409
00:35:05,864 --> 00:35:06,963
were scheduled to fight
the mud people

410
00:35:06,965 --> 00:35:09,832
the very next day on the top
of mud Mountain at noon.

411
00:35:09,834 --> 00:35:13,068
So he got up early,
and he climbed the Mountain,

412
00:35:13,070 --> 00:35:15,670
and he waited
by a small metal cross

413
00:35:15,672 --> 00:35:17,371
embedded
in the top of the hill.

414
00:35:17,373 --> 00:35:21,308
Pretty soon, he heard
the sound of marching.

415
00:35:21,310 --> 00:35:24,444
But to his horror,
it was the mud people.

416
00:35:24,446 --> 00:35:30,183
They had arrived an hour early
because they're mud people.

417
00:35:30,685 --> 00:35:32,584
Anyway, mud people all around.

418
00:35:32,586 --> 00:35:35,453
Jackie figured he'd better
do something.

419
00:35:35,455 --> 00:35:38,322
So he pulled the metal cross
out of the ground.

420
00:35:38,324 --> 00:35:39,389
But to his surprise,

421
00:35:39,391 --> 00:35:43,793
the metal cross turned out
to be a huge sword.

422
00:35:43,795 --> 00:35:46,962
Well, the mud people, they just
gurgled and laughed and...

423
00:35:46,964 --> 00:35:51,266
Then something incredible
started to happen.

424
00:35:51,801 --> 00:35:55,102
Mud Mountain began to tremble

425
00:35:56,071 --> 00:35:59,272
and shake and grow.

426
00:35:59,274 --> 00:36:04,410
And the shaking threw the mud
people off their slimy feet.

427
00:36:06,347 --> 00:36:10,382
And Jackie just
stood there speechless

428
00:36:10,384 --> 00:36:14,185
as the head
of this giant dragon

429
00:36:14,187 --> 00:36:17,154
appeared and said:

430
00:36:18,090 --> 00:36:19,789
"Gee, thanks, bubba.

431
00:36:19,791 --> 00:36:24,393
That sword's been a pain
in my neck for a long time."

432
00:36:24,762 --> 00:36:26,962
Because mud Mountain

433
00:36:26,964 --> 00:36:29,798
was actually the back
of a giant dragon

434
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:32,534
that had been asleep
for centuries.

435
00:36:32,536 --> 00:36:34,669
Jackie woke him up.

436
00:36:34,671 --> 00:36:36,470
Yes, he did.

437
00:36:37,239 --> 00:36:40,106
And all of king Arthur's
court cheered

438
00:36:40,108 --> 00:36:42,975
as Jackie returned
riding his dragon.

439
00:36:42,977 --> 00:36:47,546
Who he called Curtis,
because that was his name.

440
00:36:50,083 --> 00:36:52,950
So what happened
to Jackie and Curtis?

441
00:36:52,952 --> 00:36:55,686
Did they live
happily ever after?

442
00:36:57,289 --> 00:36:58,788
No.

443
00:36:59,690 --> 00:37:02,657
They just sort of lost touch.

444
00:37:03,359 --> 00:37:06,360
It's not a very good ending.

445
00:37:06,962 --> 00:37:09,329
No, it isn't, is it?

446
00:37:11,766 --> 00:37:14,500
In fact, dad, it sucks.

447
00:37:16,670 --> 00:37:18,336
<i>It's not fair!</i>

448
00:37:18,338 --> 00:37:21,372
Why'd we even
rent the damn boat?

449
00:37:22,208 --> 00:37:23,874
You're right, Josh.

450
00:37:23,876 --> 00:37:27,043
We'll return the keys tomorrow.
They're on the table.

451
00:37:27,045 --> 00:37:28,778
No, that's not what I mean.

452
00:37:28,780 --> 00:37:31,347
This is seriously
affecting my development.

453
00:37:31,349 --> 00:37:35,150
Joshua, look! He's havin' fun.

454
00:37:37,987 --> 00:37:40,320
Dad, he's a moron.

455
00:37:48,229 --> 00:37:51,430
¶

456
00:37:52,566 --> 00:37:55,500
Hiro! Hiro!

457
00:38:04,343 --> 00:38:06,876
Don't break this now.

458
00:38:07,979 --> 00:38:13,115
You guys wanna hang out here
while I drop by Dr. Bell's?

459
00:38:14,318 --> 00:38:15,984
I'll come with you.

460
00:38:15,986 --> 00:38:18,486
No, no, thanks, honey.

461
00:38:20,156 --> 00:38:22,289
It doesn't do anything.

462
00:38:22,291 --> 00:38:23,256
Go on.

463
00:38:23,258 --> 00:38:24,423
A hundred?

464
00:38:24,425 --> 00:38:28,293
Enjoy yourselves.
I won't be long.

465
00:38:28,495 --> 00:38:30,661
Dad, this is...

466
00:38:34,933 --> 00:38:35,998
Frank.

467
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:39,801
Last time we met, you were describing
the euphoria you experienced

468
00:38:39,803 --> 00:38:44,038
during your hallucination
with the monster.

469
00:38:44,373 --> 00:38:44,871
Jack!

470
00:38:44,873 --> 00:38:49,141
Everyone, th-this is, uh, Dr. Jack
black, a colleague of mine.

471
00:38:49,143 --> 00:38:51,042
Hi, Jack.

472
00:38:51,044 --> 00:38:52,476
Hi, Jack.

473
00:38:59,918 --> 00:39:04,854
Uh, Jack, did you want
to join us?

474
00:39:11,829 --> 00:39:15,130
Frank, do you have anything
you want to say?

475
00:39:15,132 --> 00:39:16,598
Mmm-mmm.

476
00:39:42,923 --> 00:39:45,623
Uh, uh, now, Frank,

477
00:39:45,625 --> 00:39:49,326
why did this experience
make you happy?

478
00:39:51,096 --> 00:39:53,696
Because he suddenly felt free.

479
00:39:54,498 --> 00:39:56,197
Like a kid again.

480
00:39:56,199 --> 00:39:57,431
Yeah,

481
00:39:57,433 --> 00:40:00,400
yeah. Like a kid again.

482
00:40:01,836 --> 00:40:04,336
Frank, do you have
anything to say?

483
00:40:04,338 --> 00:40:05,337
No!

484
00:40:05,339 --> 00:40:07,505
Frank, don't worry.

485
00:40:07,707 --> 00:40:09,306
It'll pass.

486
00:40:09,641 --> 00:40:12,775
Actually, it sort of
comes and goes.

487
00:40:13,911 --> 00:40:15,543
What does?

488
00:40:16,045 --> 00:40:17,044
Feeling scared.

489
00:40:17,046 --> 00:40:20,914
Simon, why don't we let Frank
describe his own feelings.

490
00:40:20,916 --> 00:40:23,116
How are you feeling, Frank?

491
00:40:23,118 --> 00:40:24,650
Scared.

492
00:40:24,985 --> 00:40:28,419
Now, Frank,
that's what Simon said.

493
00:40:29,522 --> 00:40:31,922
I-I-it's very important
that you find your own words

494
00:40:31,924 --> 00:40:36,726
to describe your own feelings
and your own experiences.

495
00:40:39,063 --> 00:40:42,297
So are you saying
you're no longer as happy

496
00:40:42,299 --> 00:40:44,766
as you once were
about your experience?

497
00:40:44,768 --> 00:40:46,501
No.

498
00:40:46,503 --> 00:40:48,803
It's just that sometimes,

499
00:40:48,805 --> 00:40:51,772
it feels as though someone...

500
00:40:57,045 --> 00:40:57,710
Yes, Frank?

501
00:40:57,712 --> 00:40:59,278
Tell 'em!

502
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:01,780
Someone's tryin' to...

503
00:41:05,886 --> 00:41:09,387
Someone wants to...

504
00:41:11,724 --> 00:41:12,889
Kill you!

505
00:41:12,891 --> 00:41:13,422
Yes!

506
00:41:13,424 --> 00:41:14,856
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

507
00:41:14,858 --> 00:41:16,757
Like there's something
really bad out there.

508
00:41:16,759 --> 00:41:19,793
Like evil forces
all... all around you.

509
00:41:19,795 --> 00:41:20,927
It's in the air you breathe.

510
00:41:20,929 --> 00:41:21,894
Everywhere.

511
00:41:21,896 --> 00:41:23,595
Oh.
And it's only getting worse.

512
00:41:23,597 --> 00:41:26,030
Yeah! Yeah!

513
00:41:26,298 --> 00:41:29,299
And voices,
like giant mosquito noises.

514
00:41:29,301 --> 00:41:30,466
Yeah, mosquito noises.

515
00:41:30,468 --> 00:41:33,402
E-except they're
all distorted like...

516
00:41:34,671 --> 00:41:36,704
Like that! Yeah! Yeah!

517
00:41:36,706 --> 00:41:38,839
I don't hear buzzing.
I don't scratch my gut!

518
00:41:38,841 --> 00:41:40,707
I don't believe in orky.
I'm not a nut.

519
00:41:40,709 --> 00:41:44,811
All right. Gentlemen.
Gentlemen! Everybody!

520
00:41:44,813 --> 00:41:46,445
Hey, guys!

521
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:49,380
Guys! Guys?

522
00:41:50,549 --> 00:41:52,015
¶

523
00:42:11,101 --> 00:42:13,568
Oh, my!

524
00:43:37,150 --> 00:43:38,582
Keep an eye on them.

525
00:43:38,584 --> 00:43:40,116
If they get any closer
to the site,

526
00:43:40,118 --> 00:43:42,718
we'll have to move to plan b.

527
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:45,287
Damn monster huggers.

528
00:43:59,268 --> 00:44:02,235
Dump her in the usual spot,
boys,

529
00:44:02,237 --> 00:44:03,769
and keep a low profile.

530
00:44:03,771 --> 00:44:05,170
Ok, boss.

531
00:46:21,829 --> 00:46:24,029
¶

532
00:46:57,293 --> 00:46:58,692
China?

533
00:46:58,694 --> 00:47:00,560
Oh!

534
00:47:03,598 --> 00:47:05,965
Hey! Hey, wait!

535
00:47:17,578 --> 00:47:19,077
Hey!

536
00:47:19,345 --> 00:47:20,811
Hey.

537
00:47:24,316 --> 00:47:26,582
Find anything yet?

538
00:47:27,585 --> 00:47:28,951
I don't understand it.

539
00:47:28,953 --> 00:47:31,954
There must be a tunnel
down here or somethin'.

540
00:47:31,956 --> 00:47:33,555
Ya think?

541
00:47:33,723 --> 00:47:35,389
Mmm-hmm.

542
00:47:40,529 --> 00:47:44,731
I always figured
diggin's kinda like swingin'.

543
00:47:45,934 --> 00:47:50,503
If you swing high enough,
you get some place magical.

544
00:47:50,505 --> 00:47:53,105
Like breaking
the sound barrier.

545
00:47:53,107 --> 00:47:55,107
Only harder.

546
00:47:59,947 --> 00:48:03,782
Sure would like
to break through, though.

547
00:48:22,166 --> 00:48:26,101
Dad, we should go inside.

548
00:48:27,604 --> 00:48:29,437
It's gonna rain.

549
00:48:30,706 --> 00:48:33,740
Wait, we gotta try somethin'.

550
00:48:35,477 --> 00:48:37,643
It'll be great.

551
00:48:41,982 --> 00:48:44,582
Ah! That one over there.

552
00:48:44,584 --> 00:48:47,518
That is Columbus discoverus
formation.

553
00:48:47,520 --> 00:48:50,554
"Columbus discoverus"?
There's no such thing.

554
00:48:50,556 --> 00:48:53,823
Oh, yeah? Look carefully.

555
00:48:54,559 --> 00:48:55,958
See it?

556
00:49:04,800 --> 00:49:08,902
You have to look really,
really close to see it.

557
00:49:09,070 --> 00:49:13,305
Forget everything you think
you know and really look.

558
00:49:17,544 --> 00:49:18,409
Right there.

559
00:49:18,411 --> 00:49:21,245
I think I see the <i> Santa Maria.</i>

560
00:49:21,247 --> 00:49:23,280
Yeah, and I see the pinto.

561
00:49:23,282 --> 00:49:26,549
<i>Pinta!</i> Come on. Help me.

562
00:49:55,178 --> 00:49:56,977
What the hell?

563
00:49:56,979 --> 00:49:58,979
This is weird!

564
00:49:59,715 --> 00:50:03,183
Over there! Right there. Guess.

565
00:50:06,154 --> 00:50:08,487
Oh, my God!

566
00:50:09,323 --> 00:50:10,889
I see a bunny.

567
00:50:12,158 --> 00:50:13,757
The energizer.

568
00:50:15,427 --> 00:50:18,161
Or is it a bird? A bald eagle.

569
00:50:18,163 --> 00:50:21,731
Whoa! I see smoke signals.

570
00:50:23,668 --> 00:50:25,300
This is incredible, dad.

571
00:50:25,302 --> 00:50:30,238
Me and my grandpa used to do this
all the time when I was a kid.

572
00:50:31,207 --> 00:50:31,772
He told me

573
00:50:31,774 --> 00:50:36,143
that the sky is the one thing
that witnesses all of history

574
00:50:36,145 --> 00:50:36,676
and records it.

575
00:50:36,678 --> 00:50:39,512
It's full of
really incredible things.

576
00:50:39,514 --> 00:50:42,448
You just gotta look for 'em.

577
00:50:45,219 --> 00:50:47,385
Do it again, dad.

578
00:50:47,387 --> 00:50:49,387
Yeah, do more.

579
00:50:49,389 --> 00:50:50,955
Yeah?

580
00:50:51,691 --> 00:50:53,390
Ok.

581
00:50:55,326 --> 00:50:56,892
Ready?

582
00:51:07,604 --> 00:51:08,603
Behold.

583
00:51:10,607 --> 00:51:12,206
The 4th of July!

584
00:51:45,173 --> 00:51:47,339
Hey, Uncle kipper.

585
00:51:56,080 --> 00:51:59,514
Sorry I'm late. Here's the
new supply of sedatives.

586
00:52:03,919 --> 00:52:06,253
Dad, that was awesome.

587
00:52:06,255 --> 00:52:07,354
It was.

588
00:52:09,424 --> 00:52:11,056
Noogie, noogie, noogie!

589
00:52:12,059 --> 00:52:13,558
Timber!

590
00:52:25,170 --> 00:52:27,003
Oh, hi.

591
00:52:28,673 --> 00:52:29,772
Wanda,

592
00:52:29,774 --> 00:52:30,706
I'm sorry about yesterday.

593
00:52:30,708 --> 00:52:33,542
Last night I read
your latest work:

594
00:52:33,544 --> 00:52:36,177
"Male drum beating without
the touchy-feely stuff."

595
00:52:36,179 --> 00:52:39,413
Really sensitive. Do you always
make fun of your patients?

596
00:52:39,415 --> 00:52:41,748
Stop whining!

597
00:52:47,755 --> 00:52:49,187
Wanda,

598
00:52:49,956 --> 00:52:51,789
I really like you.

599
00:52:52,858 --> 00:52:54,791
I mean like a lot.

600
00:52:55,126 --> 00:52:59,661
First time I met you, I couldn't
believe how beautiful you were.

601
00:52:59,663 --> 00:53:01,062
Ahem.

602
00:53:01,364 --> 00:53:02,563
And funny.

603
00:53:02,565 --> 00:53:03,597
Dad.

604
00:53:03,599 --> 00:53:06,199
No, she's really funny.

605
00:53:12,941 --> 00:53:17,176
Oh, great, Jack,
you're bleeding.

606
00:53:20,314 --> 00:53:22,747
You better come in
and get that redressed.

607
00:53:22,749 --> 00:53:24,548
And I'd like to do some tests.

608
00:53:24,550 --> 00:53:27,017
Tests?

609
00:53:31,322 --> 00:53:34,323
Now, tell me what you see.

610
00:53:40,497 --> 00:53:44,232
Jack, could you
please try to concentrate?

611
00:53:48,504 --> 00:53:49,836
Ahem.

612
00:53:55,109 --> 00:53:56,475
Children.

613
00:53:59,847 --> 00:54:01,413
Playing.

614
00:54:01,915 --> 00:54:04,215
Thousands of 'em.

615
00:54:05,585 --> 00:54:07,818
But one's missing.

616
00:54:08,654 --> 00:54:10,420
That's what you see?

617
00:54:10,422 --> 00:54:12,655
Did you draw this?

618
00:54:18,929 --> 00:54:21,663
Because it's really good.

619
00:54:22,799 --> 00:54:27,001
Jack, have you noticed anything
unusual since your accident?

620
00:54:27,003 --> 00:54:30,104
Like difficulty concentrating?

621
00:54:34,343 --> 00:54:38,878
Have you been experiencing intense
feelings of joy and fear?

622
00:54:40,514 --> 00:54:43,515
Jack, let me see your stomach.

623
00:54:46,853 --> 00:54:49,420
The rash!

624
00:54:50,356 --> 00:54:54,024
Jack, h-have you
seen the monster?

625
00:54:54,192 --> 00:54:56,859
What? Monster? No.

626
00:54:56,861 --> 00:54:59,561
No. That was a dream.

627
00:54:59,563 --> 00:55:01,863
Um, from my accident.

628
00:55:01,865 --> 00:55:03,497
This is incredible!
I don't believe it!

629
00:55:03,499 --> 00:55:08,535
Somehow you have taken on the
psychoses of my other patients.

630
00:55:09,304 --> 00:55:11,404
That was just a dream.

631
00:55:13,374 --> 00:55:15,273
Wasn't it?

632
00:55:17,377 --> 00:55:21,345
I'm gonna have to keep
you here for observation.

633
00:56:22,238 --> 00:56:25,872
Do want me to shut
the window tonight?

634
00:56:35,549 --> 00:56:40,451
It's ok. It's ok. It's ok.

635
00:57:10,746 --> 00:57:12,979
I can't reach mom.

636
00:57:18,586 --> 00:57:20,786
What are those for?

637
00:57:21,088 --> 00:57:22,954
They're for him.

638
00:57:22,956 --> 00:57:26,223
I think he might
be able to help.

639
00:57:26,925 --> 00:57:30,126
Ashley, would you knock
it off with that stuff?

640
00:57:30,128 --> 00:57:30,960
It's not funny. But...

641
00:57:30,962 --> 00:57:34,229
don't talk to dad about it, you'll
get him locked up for good!

642
00:57:34,231 --> 00:57:35,496
They'll throw him
in some loony bin,

643
00:57:35,498 --> 00:57:37,364
and we're never
gonna see him again.

644
00:57:37,366 --> 00:57:40,133
But Josh, there is a monster.
He ate my cookies.

645
00:57:40,135 --> 00:57:44,070
Damn it, Ashley.
Just get off it. Will you?

646
00:57:44,172 --> 00:57:46,939
This is not a game anymore.

647
00:57:46,941 --> 00:57:48,340
Grow up.

648
00:58:45,796 --> 00:58:47,028
Hey, Josh.

649
00:59:08,751 --> 00:59:12,786
Ok, but I wanna see you
swallow those pills.

650
00:59:15,824 --> 00:59:19,358
Why'd he write
dad's name on his house?

651
00:59:19,860 --> 00:59:21,793
I don't know.

652
00:59:22,896 --> 00:59:25,329
Can you help our dad?

653
00:59:29,335 --> 00:59:31,735
This guy's gone wacko.

654
00:59:32,471 --> 00:59:33,403
"Omni sweet"?

655
00:59:33,405 --> 00:59:35,872
Probably on some
artificial sugar high.

656
00:59:35,874 --> 00:59:38,307
I think he wants some more.

657
00:59:38,309 --> 00:59:41,009
He saw some in our cabin.

658
00:59:55,025 --> 00:59:57,658
Why don't you kids
go and play now?

659
01:00:05,866 --> 01:00:09,000
Hello? Oh, yes, doctor.

660
01:00:11,170 --> 01:00:13,436
Yes, everything's fine.

661
01:00:13,704 --> 01:00:15,236
Ok. Bye-bye.

662
01:00:21,777 --> 01:00:25,278
Come on, now. Down the hatch
like a good boy.

663
01:00:48,768 --> 01:00:53,036
I will explain everything
when we get there.

664
01:00:53,038 --> 01:00:55,772
Come, we must hurry!

665
01:00:57,208 --> 01:00:59,841
What does this have
to do with our dad?

666
01:00:59,843 --> 01:01:01,542
Everything.

667
01:01:09,451 --> 01:01:11,884
It's here somewhere.

668
01:01:11,886 --> 01:01:14,019
I know it's here.

669
01:01:20,660 --> 01:01:24,762
Faster. We must go faster.

670
01:01:24,764 --> 01:01:26,296
We?

671
01:01:32,404 --> 01:01:34,470
Where are we?

672
01:01:52,854 --> 01:01:54,753
Give me a hand.

673
01:02:04,897 --> 01:02:09,165
It's here. I know it's here.

674
01:02:10,835 --> 01:02:12,768
Oh, oh.

675
01:02:23,147 --> 01:02:25,981
Ah. Here it is.

676
01:02:32,155 --> 01:02:36,090
Not so long ago,
man could become animal

677
01:02:36,092 --> 01:02:38,525
and animal could become man.

678
01:02:38,527 --> 01:02:43,129
Back and forth,
whenever they wanted.

679
01:02:43,231 --> 01:02:46,065
Animals could shed their skins.

680
01:02:46,067 --> 01:02:50,302
And humans could
become anything.

681
01:02:50,304 --> 01:02:54,139
A wolf, a fish, a bird.

682
01:02:54,141 --> 01:02:57,442
Did you ever have dreams
about flying?

683
01:02:57,444 --> 01:02:59,277
Yeah.

684
01:02:59,279 --> 01:03:01,245
We all have those.

685
01:03:01,247 --> 01:03:04,248
It's part of our secret
memory of those times.

686
01:03:04,250 --> 01:03:07,317
What does this have to do
with our dad?

687
01:03:08,119 --> 01:03:09,818
There's more.

688
01:03:21,198 --> 01:03:22,564
Orky!

689
01:03:22,566 --> 01:03:24,732
They're killin' him

690
01:03:24,734 --> 01:03:26,867
by putting toxins in the lake.

691
01:03:26,869 --> 01:03:29,569
That's what he's been
tryin' to tell us.

692
01:03:29,571 --> 01:03:32,338
Your father and the others.

693
01:03:32,340 --> 01:03:35,375
It's the only way he knows how.

694
01:03:35,377 --> 01:03:38,945
His breath. His breath was bad.

695
01:03:38,947 --> 01:03:39,979
I knew he was sick!

696
01:03:39,981 --> 01:03:41,914
Wait. Are you tryin' to tell me

697
01:03:41,916 --> 01:03:44,683
that my dad's some sort
of messenger or something?

698
01:03:44,685 --> 01:03:48,319
Uh-huh. He's sick
'cause orky's sick.

699
01:03:50,389 --> 01:03:52,856
I'm glad you believed him.

700
01:03:52,858 --> 01:03:55,592
That's why he came to you.

701
01:03:58,330 --> 01:03:59,896
As you grow,

702
01:03:59,898 --> 01:04:04,166
trust your heart
as much as your mind.

703
01:04:04,968 --> 01:04:07,702
It's the best part of you.

704
01:04:10,540 --> 01:04:13,173
Now go tell your dad.

705
01:04:14,476 --> 01:04:16,776
He has to know.

706
01:04:17,445 --> 01:04:19,578
I'll be fine.

707
01:04:48,438 --> 01:04:49,670
Well?

708
01:04:49,672 --> 01:04:52,005
We got trouble, boss.

709
01:04:52,440 --> 01:04:56,375
Japs came within 50 yards
of the dump site.

710
01:04:56,610 --> 01:04:59,911
I think it's time
to move to plan b.

711
01:05:01,381 --> 01:05:03,381
Dad! Dad, you're not crazy.

712
01:05:03,383 --> 01:05:04,648
You're a messenger for orky.

713
01:05:04,650 --> 01:05:07,250
You're just trying
to tell us that he's sick.

714
01:05:07,252 --> 01:05:10,653
Dad, is that what
you're tryin' to tell us?

715
01:05:16,861 --> 01:05:19,328
There is no monster.

716
01:05:20,230 --> 01:05:23,531
There is no monster.

717
01:05:23,533 --> 01:05:25,933
It was only a dream.

718
01:05:29,672 --> 01:05:32,305
Those pills.

719
01:05:36,878 --> 01:05:38,844
Shh. Quiet.

720
01:06:37,265 --> 01:06:40,065
There he is again. Hey!

721
01:06:47,939 --> 01:06:51,840
He's that little dude
from China. I told you.

722
01:06:56,545 --> 01:06:59,546
I think he's tryin'
to tell us something.

723
01:07:06,688 --> 01:07:08,254
Hey!

724
01:07:21,435 --> 01:07:23,067
That's him!

725
01:07:23,069 --> 01:07:25,869
I told you. Come on.

726
01:07:31,376 --> 01:07:32,441
This way.

727
01:07:32,443 --> 01:07:34,876
Don't lose him.
Come on, let's go!

728
01:07:34,878 --> 01:07:37,345
Through here.

729
01:07:42,852 --> 01:07:48,055
This will be worth millions.
I finally get my own wheels.

730
01:08:05,039 --> 01:08:07,739
What's he doing?

731
01:08:10,710 --> 01:08:12,776
Hurry up. Come on!

732
01:08:25,389 --> 01:08:27,322
What do you think, boss?

733
01:08:27,324 --> 01:08:29,824
It's got a few leaks,
but it'll do.

734
01:08:29,826 --> 01:08:31,559
It's a fake.

735
01:08:31,561 --> 01:08:34,028
The whole thing is a fake.

736
01:08:36,399 --> 01:08:38,899
This is going to be so good.

737
01:08:42,804 --> 01:08:45,271
But he ate my cookies.

738
01:08:45,506 --> 01:08:49,140
Fill 'er up
and you're off, boys.

739
01:08:50,843 --> 01:08:53,844
It's a perfect night.

740
01:09:01,320 --> 01:09:03,486
Come on, guys.

741
01:09:04,222 --> 01:09:06,488
There's somethin'
goin' on here.

742
01:09:06,490 --> 01:09:09,657
We're gonna find out
what it is.

743
01:09:16,966 --> 01:09:21,768
Oof. Must cost big bucks to
dispose of this stuff, huh?

744
01:09:22,737 --> 01:09:27,372
I mean, not many places take
hazardous waste these days.

745
01:09:27,540 --> 01:09:29,740
Phew.

746
01:09:30,709 --> 01:09:33,743
I know that smell. Shh.

747
01:09:40,318 --> 01:09:41,917
Phew.

748
01:09:42,219 --> 01:09:45,086
Just land her on shore, right
in the middle of town.

749
01:09:45,088 --> 01:09:46,120
Yeah. And confess.

750
01:09:46,122 --> 01:09:48,655
Tell the world it's been
a hoax all these years.

751
01:09:48,657 --> 01:09:51,424
An attempt to create
a tourist industry.

752
01:09:51,426 --> 01:09:53,926
No more ridiculous
foreigners bothering us

753
01:09:53,928 --> 01:09:56,962
with their effeminate
little submarines.

754
01:09:56,964 --> 01:09:58,596
No more whining natives
claiming

755
01:09:58,598 --> 01:10:01,599
that we're endangering
an endangered species.

756
01:10:01,601 --> 01:10:05,102
We're left alone
to go about our business.

757
01:10:05,104 --> 01:10:06,937
Everybody's happy.

758
01:10:06,939 --> 01:10:08,505
Especially me.

759
01:10:08,707 --> 01:10:10,807
An inspired, creative,

760
01:10:10,809 --> 01:10:13,643
cerebral plan, don't you think?

761
01:10:13,645 --> 01:10:14,710
I hate violence.

762
01:10:14,712 --> 01:10:18,280
Josh, we can't let him do this.

763
01:10:19,449 --> 01:10:22,416
You stay here
and keep a lookout.

764
01:10:22,551 --> 01:10:26,119
I'm gonna see if I can
sabotage that thing.

765
01:10:33,094 --> 01:10:35,794
Uh, uh, one more question.

766
01:10:36,029 --> 01:10:38,562
Where's the men's room?

767
01:10:40,632 --> 01:10:42,264
Thank you.

768
01:10:43,400 --> 01:10:44,866
Come on.

769
01:11:01,982 --> 01:11:06,517
Josh, they heard us.
We gotta get outta here.

770
01:11:07,086 --> 01:11:08,618
Josh!

771
01:11:14,123 --> 01:11:16,389
I can drive this.

772
01:11:16,491 --> 01:11:19,258
We can use it as evidence.

773
01:11:20,127 --> 01:11:22,160
Bon voyage.

774
01:11:22,162 --> 01:11:25,630
And remember,
you never heard of me.

775
01:11:26,532 --> 01:11:30,934
Go on, get back there.
Come on, come on. Go, go, go.

776
01:11:32,504 --> 01:11:34,270
¶ Bring down the lights ¶

777
01:11:34,272 --> 01:11:36,438

Josh, what are we gonna do?

783
01:11:48,549 --> 01:11:52,817
Wait 'til he gets out,
we'll go to the police. Shh.

784
01:11:53,286 --> 01:11:55,853
Inspiration. Inspiration.

785
01:11:55,921 --> 01:11:59,589
<i>¶</i>

786
01:12:09,233 --> 01:12:11,233
God, I'm good.

787
01:12:21,912 --> 01:12:24,979
Ok. And

788
01:12:25,414 --> 01:12:27,080
bingo.

789
01:12:27,515 --> 01:12:29,615
I'm outta here.

790
01:12:41,092 --> 01:12:43,926
Where'd he go?

791
01:12:44,228 --> 01:12:46,661
Whoa.

792
01:12:47,363 --> 01:12:50,897
What's happening?
I dunno. Something's wrong

793
01:12:50,899 --> 01:12:52,965
big trouble. Ok.

794
01:12:52,967 --> 01:12:55,468
Big trouble.

795
01:12:58,673 --> 01:13:01,340
What's he doing? What the...

796
01:13:03,744 --> 01:13:05,810
Josh!

797
01:13:06,445 --> 01:13:08,478
Stop. Stop. Stop.

798
01:13:08,480 --> 01:13:09,779
Stop. Turn! I'm tryin'!

799
01:13:09,781 --> 01:13:13,682
No, no, Josh!
No, turn. No! Turn!

800
01:13:13,684 --> 01:13:16,317
Find the brake! Ah, found it!

801
01:13:21,590 --> 01:13:23,289
We hit it!

802
01:13:23,357 --> 01:13:25,657
That colossal idiot!

803
01:13:29,062 --> 01:13:30,861
Josh.

804
01:13:34,533 --> 01:13:39,035
We gotta get outta here.
Let's go! Come on, let's go!

805
01:13:40,905 --> 01:13:43,238
Josh, open it.

806
01:13:44,908 --> 01:13:46,540
It's stuck.

807
01:13:48,477 --> 01:13:50,910
That's the dump site.

808
01:13:51,145 --> 01:13:53,612
No. Not there!

809
01:13:54,247 --> 01:13:55,512
Anywhere but there!

810
01:13:55,514 --> 01:13:58,248
There's gotta be a pump switch
in here somewhere.

811
01:13:59,884 --> 01:14:03,785
I found it! Found it.
Josh, it's sinking fast.

812
01:14:07,323 --> 01:14:08,822
Help!

813
01:14:11,726 --> 01:14:14,393
Help, please help!

814
01:14:46,058 --> 01:14:50,326
They're probably
looking for us right now.

815
01:14:50,461 --> 01:14:51,693
It's been a long time.

816
01:14:51,695 --> 01:14:55,930
They probably don't even know
we're missing.

817
01:14:55,932 --> 01:14:57,798
Besides,

818
01:14:57,900 --> 01:15:00,634
good luck finding us.

819
01:15:07,708 --> 01:15:11,676
Wait. Did you guys hear that?

820
01:15:13,279 --> 01:15:14,511
That was me.

821
01:15:14,513 --> 01:15:15,512
What are you doing?

822
01:15:15,514 --> 01:15:20,149
I'm calling orky.
He'll hear us that way.

823
01:15:20,151 --> 01:15:23,685
Ash, this is orky.

824
01:15:24,454 --> 01:15:26,487
It's a fake.

825
01:15:26,922 --> 01:15:28,521
Get a grip.

826
01:15:44,505 --> 01:15:46,004
Jack?

827
01:15:48,274 --> 01:15:49,673
Jack?

828
01:15:51,343 --> 01:15:53,543
Oh, Jack, what are you doing?

829
01:15:53,545 --> 01:15:56,145
Trying to find my kids.

830
01:16:00,117 --> 01:16:02,584
Where are they today, Jack?

831
01:16:09,358 --> 01:16:12,359
Jack, are you ok?

832
01:16:15,464 --> 01:16:19,399
Jack, it's gonna be all right.
Come on up.

833
01:16:22,537 --> 01:16:24,403
One step at a time.

834
01:16:28,107 --> 01:16:31,842
Uh-oh. Whoa! Whoa!

835
01:16:34,413 --> 01:16:35,678
Oh!

836
01:16:35,680 --> 01:16:41,383
And I saw a...
Big, big, huge...

837
01:16:44,488 --> 01:16:47,455
That little idiot. Look at him.

838
01:16:47,457 --> 01:16:49,056
He's confessing.

839
01:16:49,058 --> 01:16:51,324
Well, isn't that what
he was supposed to do?

840
01:16:51,326 --> 01:16:54,293
It wasn't supposed to sink,
you moron.

841
01:16:54,295 --> 01:16:57,329
Now they're gonna
go looking for it.

842
01:16:57,331 --> 01:17:01,466
Take the explosives
and rig the dump site.

843
01:17:13,179 --> 01:17:16,246
I hope dad'll be all right.

844
01:17:18,016 --> 01:17:21,617
Yeah. Me too.

845
01:17:26,156 --> 01:17:27,088
What was that?

846
01:17:27,090 --> 01:17:29,290
Orky?

847
01:17:31,761 --> 01:17:33,393
Hey! We're rescued!

848
01:17:33,395 --> 01:17:38,598
I can't believe it. They
actually found us. Yes! Yes.

849
01:17:42,904 --> 01:17:44,103
Josh.

850
01:17:44,105 --> 01:17:47,306
What? What is it?

851
01:17:47,808 --> 01:17:49,607
Oh, shit.

852
01:17:50,409 --> 01:17:53,243
It's those one-armed dudes.

853
01:17:58,750 --> 01:18:00,282
Damn it!

854
01:18:21,137 --> 01:18:22,469
Whoa.

855
01:18:38,819 --> 01:18:41,186
Wow.

856
01:18:45,425 --> 01:18:47,324
Wow.

857
01:18:50,194 --> 01:18:52,394
We're moving.

858
01:19:20,321 --> 01:19:21,687
Well, well, well.

859
01:19:21,689 --> 01:19:24,589
What have you boys been up to?

860
01:19:25,058 --> 01:19:27,458
Hey! There's
something down there!

861
01:19:27,460 --> 01:19:29,460
Yeah, there's somethin'
down there!

862
01:19:29,462 --> 01:19:32,830
Yeah! Something big!

863
01:19:43,574 --> 01:19:45,607
We was just followin' orders.

864
01:19:45,609 --> 01:19:47,642
Hey! Miller's gonna kill you.

865
01:19:47,644 --> 01:19:49,710
Uh, mack Miller?

866
01:19:53,448 --> 01:19:57,082
What do you say
we take a little ride, boys?

867
01:20:08,628 --> 01:20:11,562
Come on, orky. Hurry!

868
01:20:12,197 --> 01:20:15,565
He'd better, or we're history.

869
01:20:38,856 --> 01:20:40,322
Where are we?

870
01:21:03,646 --> 01:21:05,112
Dad?

871
01:21:05,114 --> 01:21:06,513
Daddy!

872
01:21:07,415 --> 01:21:09,281
Hey, guys.

873
01:21:10,617 --> 01:21:13,784
Come on. Are you all right?

874
01:21:13,786 --> 01:21:17,187
How did you get here?

875
01:21:17,822 --> 01:21:19,454
Gravity?

876
01:21:19,456 --> 01:21:20,855
What is this place?

877
01:21:20,857 --> 01:21:23,858
I love you guys so much.

878
01:21:25,294 --> 01:21:27,227
Ah, whoo.

879
01:21:27,862 --> 01:21:28,594
Who are you?

880
01:21:28,596 --> 01:21:30,395
That's Hiro. He's from China.

881
01:21:30,397 --> 01:21:32,096
Hey, how you doin', Hiro?

882
01:21:35,300 --> 01:21:40,136
I have been here before.
This place was in my dream.

883
01:21:41,072 --> 01:21:43,272
This place is real!

884
01:21:44,675 --> 01:21:46,374
This is it.

885
01:21:46,376 --> 01:21:49,844
Dad! This is where he lives.

886
01:22:07,293 --> 01:22:08,558
Orky.

887
01:22:21,704 --> 01:22:23,370
Wow.

888
01:22:33,981 --> 01:22:36,414
Hi. It's me.

889
01:22:44,224 --> 01:22:46,190
It's all right.

890
01:22:50,929 --> 01:22:53,429
You like your nose tickled?

891
01:22:55,132 --> 01:22:56,865
I guess so.

892
01:23:01,237 --> 01:23:03,270
Hey, boy.

893
01:23:07,442 --> 01:23:09,508
You saved our lives.

894
01:23:09,643 --> 01:23:11,876
How you doin'?

895
01:23:13,279 --> 01:23:15,412
I love you, orky.

896
01:23:27,924 --> 01:23:29,957
Dad, he's bleeding.

897
01:23:36,565 --> 01:23:39,499
Dad, look at his back.

898
01:23:41,803 --> 01:23:43,569
Oh, God.

899
01:23:43,571 --> 01:23:46,872
It could be the toxins, dad.

900
01:23:52,679 --> 01:23:54,412
What's happening, daddy?

901
01:23:54,414 --> 01:23:56,547
I think he'd dying, honey.

902
01:23:56,549 --> 01:23:58,382
No!

903
01:24:02,353 --> 01:24:05,887
Hey! Hey! Come on!

904
01:24:05,889 --> 01:24:07,655
Come on. No.

905
01:24:09,625 --> 01:24:11,925
Please. No!

906
01:24:11,927 --> 01:24:12,525
Come on.

907
01:24:12,527 --> 01:24:16,395
Daddy, no. Daddy.

908
01:24:16,397 --> 01:24:18,330
Orky. Come on.

909
01:24:18,332 --> 01:24:21,733
Orky, no. No.

910
01:24:22,902 --> 01:24:26,470
Give him space, honey.
No, daddy. Please.

911
01:24:29,842 --> 01:24:31,141
Please. No, no.

912
01:24:31,143 --> 01:24:36,846
Orky, I won't let you die.
Please don't die.

913
01:24:36,848 --> 01:24:41,183
No. No. Please, no.

914
01:24:41,185 --> 01:24:43,985
I'm sorry, honey.

915
01:24:54,028 --> 01:24:56,328
It's all right.

916
01:24:56,330 --> 01:24:58,363
Come here.

917
01:25:05,538 --> 01:25:08,305
He's been sick for a long time.

918
01:25:08,307 --> 01:25:10,573
He's out of pain.

919
01:25:18,015 --> 01:25:21,649
Wow, look at that.
Is that a sand castle?

920
01:25:21,784 --> 01:25:23,550
Bit more, bit more.
All right, comin' down.

921
01:25:23,552 --> 01:25:26,653
All right, that's good.
That's good. Keep going.

922
01:25:26,655 --> 01:25:28,321
Buddy, move it!
Get away from the hole.

923
01:25:28,323 --> 01:25:31,390
We gotta keep this hole clear.

924
01:25:42,903 --> 01:25:46,137
Don't let them find him, ok?

925
01:26:07,923 --> 01:26:09,722
Are you ok, honey?

926
01:26:11,058 --> 01:26:13,258
Are you all right?

927
01:26:15,395 --> 01:26:16,894
Jack?

928
01:26:17,496 --> 01:26:20,497
Mr. Black? Did you see
anything down there?

929
01:26:20,499 --> 01:26:22,465
No. I didn't see anything.

930
01:26:22,467 --> 01:26:24,200
Can you tell us
what it was like?

931
01:26:24,202 --> 01:26:26,402
There's nothin' down there.

932
01:26:26,670 --> 01:26:28,469
Rope up and get a shot anyway.

933
01:26:28,471 --> 01:26:30,137
We need it for the story.

934
01:26:30,139 --> 01:26:31,404
Dad, no.

935
01:26:31,406 --> 01:26:34,173
Hey, did you hear what I said?

936
01:26:34,341 --> 01:26:40,144
Hey, are you listening to me?
There is nothing down there.

937
01:26:40,146 --> 01:26:41,345
I mean it.

938
01:26:43,582 --> 01:26:45,682
Sheriff? It's not safe.

939
01:26:45,684 --> 01:26:47,650
Don't be silly. He'll be fine.

940
01:26:47,652 --> 01:26:49,685
It's not safe!

941
01:26:51,321 --> 01:26:53,587
Please. Don't...

942
01:26:55,257 --> 01:26:57,023
Dad?

943
01:26:57,392 --> 01:26:59,258
No.

944
01:27:02,263 --> 01:27:04,529
¶ Ay-yah-ho ¶

945
01:27:04,531 --> 01:27:06,330

We're gonna need some...

¶ Ay-yah ay-yah-ho ¶

951
01:27:55,910 --> 01:27:59,645

<i>¶ ay-yah, ay-yah ¶</i>

956
01:29:18,118 --> 01:29:19,584
I told you everything
I know, Wanda.

957
01:29:19,586 --> 01:29:22,787
Just as it happened. No one
else knows except the group.

958
01:29:22,789 --> 01:29:24,622
Jack, it's not that
I don't believe you.

959
01:29:24,624 --> 01:29:27,257
It's just that
it makes no rational sense.

960
01:29:27,259 --> 01:29:28,891
Wait.

961
01:29:33,030 --> 01:29:35,530
For what it's worth,

962
01:29:35,798 --> 01:29:38,532
I am finding the irrational

963
01:29:38,534 --> 01:29:41,601
pretty damn exciting
these days.

964
01:29:49,010 --> 01:29:49,408
God.

965
01:29:49,410 --> 01:29:54,713
There's nothing I'd like more than
to see things the way you do.

966
01:30:14,201 --> 01:30:17,168
Want to come in for a swim?

967
01:30:33,653 --> 01:30:37,287
I know you miss him, ash.
I do too.

968
01:30:40,992 --> 01:30:44,360
I wonder what he's doin'
right now.

969
01:30:46,497 --> 01:30:48,864
Nothing. He's gone.

970
01:30:50,834 --> 01:30:53,768
He's only gone
if you let him be.

971
01:30:59,075 --> 01:31:04,011
Remember that story I told
you about Curtis and Jackie?

972
01:31:04,813 --> 01:31:05,278
Yup.

973
01:31:05,280 --> 01:31:08,481
Well, I remember
the ending now.

974
01:31:09,116 --> 01:31:11,015
Jackie grew up.

975
01:31:12,184 --> 01:31:15,318
And he had a child of his own.

976
01:31:15,320 --> 01:31:17,653
A beautiful little girl.

977
01:31:20,090 --> 01:31:23,624
And that little girl
was so full of wonder

978
01:31:23,626 --> 01:31:27,094
and appreciation and knowledge

979
01:31:27,529 --> 01:31:31,731
and all the things that
her father had left behind.

980
01:31:33,468 --> 01:31:36,335
Is this one
of those metaphors, dad?

981
01:31:39,306 --> 01:31:42,040
When did you get so smart?

982
01:31:45,678 --> 01:31:49,413
So what happened
with the little girl?

983
01:31:49,415 --> 01:31:51,415
How's it end?

984
01:31:53,786 --> 01:31:56,720
I guess that's up
to the little girl.

985
01:34:36,474 --> 01:34:39,107
Ah.

986
01:34:40,243 --> 01:34:40,743
