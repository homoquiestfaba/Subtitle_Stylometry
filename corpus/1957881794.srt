[music playing]

2
00:02:46,958 --> 00:02:48,001
-How's the soup?

3
00:02:48,001 --> 00:02:50,921
-The soup is excellent.

4
00:02:50,921 --> 00:02:53,048
-You're a good man, Frank.

5
00:02:53,048 --> 00:02:55,092
One day I'm going
to pay you back

6
00:02:55,092 --> 00:02:56,343
for everything with interest.

7
00:02:58,970 --> 00:03:03,016
-I'm going to mention this
place to all my friends.

8
00:03:03,016 --> 00:03:04,601
-Do me a favor.

9
00:03:04,601 --> 00:03:06,103
Let's just keep it between us.

10
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:22,369
[music playing]

11
00:03:41,721 --> 00:03:43,682
-Mambo Cafe.

12
00:03:43,682 --> 00:03:48,061
Look, I told you already,
the check is in the mail.

13
00:03:48,061 --> 00:03:49,646
How am I supposed
to pay you if you

14
00:03:49,646 --> 00:03:52,524
keep calling me all the time?

15
00:03:52,524 --> 00:03:55,152
I don't have time for this.

16
00:03:55,152 --> 00:03:56,570
This is a very busy place.

17
00:03:56,570 --> 00:03:59,823
I have a lot of hungry
customers hollering at me.

18
00:03:59,823 --> 00:04:03,034
They're hungry, they
need me to feed them.

19
00:04:03,034 --> 00:04:05,454
-Hey, am I going to get
any service over here?

20
00:04:05,454 --> 00:04:06,413
I want that special.

21
00:04:06,413 --> 00:04:08,665
And a side of rice and beans.

22
00:04:08,665 --> 00:04:10,834
-And give me an
order of that steak

23
00:04:10,834 --> 00:04:12,669
fillet with extra vegetables.

24
00:04:12,669 --> 00:04:14,171
Another double order--

25
00:04:14,171 --> 00:04:16,673
-Look, call me
later, in three days,

26
00:04:16,673 --> 00:04:18,175
if you haven't
gotten it yet, OK?

27
00:04:18,175 --> 00:04:19,509
Bye.

28
00:04:19,509 --> 00:04:22,596
-I think we should talk again
about what I said yesterday.

29
00:04:22,596 --> 00:04:25,307
-Look, I told you I don't
want to have no more talking

30
00:04:25,307 --> 00:04:28,768
about going back to Puerto Rico.

31
00:04:28,768 --> 00:04:30,687
Why is it that every
time a Puerto Rican has

32
00:04:30,687 --> 00:04:32,314
a little problem
over here, they take

33
00:04:32,314 --> 00:04:34,691
a $99 flight back
to Puerto Rico?

34
00:04:34,691 --> 00:04:35,901
They have a problem over there?

35
00:04:35,901 --> 00:04:38,570
They take another $99
flight back to the States.

36
00:04:38,570 --> 00:04:41,281
Did you ever see the
Greeks or the Jews

37
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:43,909
or the Italians
running back and forth

38
00:04:43,909 --> 00:04:45,660
every time things
got a little tough?

39
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:46,786
No.

40
00:04:46,786 --> 00:04:48,914
It was too and it
was too expensive.

41
00:04:48,914 --> 00:04:50,707
So they planted their
feet in America,

42
00:04:50,707 --> 00:04:53,877
and that's why they made it.

43
00:04:53,877 --> 00:04:55,337
Sometimes I think the
biggest problem we

44
00:04:55,337 --> 00:04:58,757
Puerto Rican have is
those damn $99 fares.

45
00:04:58,757 --> 00:05:01,134
-You want to know what I think
is the biggest problem we have?

46
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:02,552
-Not really.

47
00:05:02,552 --> 00:05:06,890
-It's hard-headed men like you
who are too stubborn to realize

48
00:05:06,890 --> 00:05:10,894
that it's better to struggle
on a beautiful tropical island

49
00:05:10,894 --> 00:05:13,814
than in some ghetto
in the United States.

50
00:05:13,814 --> 00:05:15,857
-I told you a hundred
times already.

51
00:05:15,857 --> 00:05:19,319
The only way I'm going back
to Puerto Rico is as a success

52
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:20,278
or in a pine box.

53
00:05:20,278 --> 00:05:21,905
-Well you better
make it pretty quick

54
00:05:21,905 --> 00:05:23,073
because in another
week all we're

55
00:05:23,073 --> 00:05:25,700
going to be able to
afford is cardboard.

56
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:27,244
-Oh, hi, Ma.

57
00:05:27,244 --> 00:05:28,119
How you doin', Pop?

58
00:05:28,119 --> 00:05:29,788
-Hey.

59
00:05:29,788 --> 00:05:31,748
Pull up those pants.

60
00:05:31,748 --> 00:05:33,166
What have you got there?

61
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:35,377
-What?

62
00:05:35,377 --> 00:05:36,169
What, nothing.

63
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:37,671
A radio.

64
00:05:37,671 --> 00:05:38,964
-You little thief!

65
00:05:38,964 --> 00:05:41,633
We didn't spend 15 years
feeding and clothings you

66
00:05:41,633 --> 00:05:43,802
so you could go and
steal car radios.

67
00:05:43,802 --> 00:05:45,220
-I didn't steal
it, Ma, all right?

68
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:48,640
I bought it off for 10 bucks and
tomorrow I'll sell it for 25.

69
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:49,599
-Now you see?

70
00:05:49,599 --> 00:05:51,101
Is that what you
want to stay here,

71
00:05:51,101 --> 00:05:54,104
so we can raise the future star
of "America's Most Wanted"?

72
00:05:54,104 --> 00:05:55,522
FRANK: What are you
getting so upset about?

73
00:05:55,522 --> 00:05:57,274
He just told you you
he didn't steal it.

74
00:05:57,274 --> 00:05:59,568
You know, that's the way
things are done here.

75
00:05:59,568 --> 00:06:01,111
You know, you buy low
and you tell high.

76
00:06:01,111 --> 00:06:03,363
-Oh to hell with your
high and your low.

77
00:06:03,363 --> 00:06:08,577
Frank, I want that piece
of junk out of here.

78
00:06:08,577 --> 00:06:12,914
-Hey, Ricky, I'll give
you $12.50 for it.

79
00:06:12,914 --> 00:06:14,416
-Come on, Pop, what
do you want it for?

80
00:06:14,416 --> 00:06:15,709
You don't even
have a car anymore.

81
00:06:15,709 --> 00:06:17,794
-Hey it's not like I'm
going to be without a car

82
00:06:17,794 --> 00:06:19,170
the rest of my life.

83
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:21,256
Soon as this place turns around,
the first thing I'm going to do

84
00:06:21,256 --> 00:06:24,384
is I'm going to buy
my old Chevy back.

85
00:06:24,384 --> 00:06:26,970
Look, you see?

86
00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:29,347
You see the kind of clientele
this place can attract?

87
00:06:29,347 --> 00:06:31,850
Huh?

88
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:33,226
Welcome to our restaurant.

89
00:06:33,226 --> 00:06:34,769
Would you prefer a window table?

90
00:06:38,607 --> 00:06:39,983
-Hi, Dad.

91
00:06:39,983 --> 00:06:40,817
It's me.

92
00:06:40,817 --> 00:06:41,568
-Nydia!

93
00:06:44,654 --> 00:06:45,405
-Hi, Ricky.

94
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:51,828
Hi, Mom.

95
00:06:57,751 --> 00:06:59,169
-What did you do to your hair?

96
00:06:59,169 --> 00:07:01,087
-I dyed it, do you like it?

97
00:07:01,087 --> 00:07:02,797
We brought you back
from Puerto Rico

98
00:07:02,797 --> 00:07:05,216
so you could get an
American education,

99
00:07:05,216 --> 00:07:07,510
not so you could turn into
Marilyn Monroe, Nydia.

100
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:08,428
-Oh, Ma.

101
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:10,472
Stop being so dramatic.

102
00:07:10,472 --> 00:07:11,806
Everybody's doing this.

103
00:07:11,806 --> 00:07:14,059
-Who cares what
color her hair is?

104
00:07:14,059 --> 00:07:16,811
The important thing is
she's back home with us.

105
00:07:16,811 --> 00:07:19,022
Now we can go to
the movies and go

106
00:07:19,022 --> 00:07:21,024
ice skating at
Rockefeller Center.

107
00:07:21,024 --> 00:07:23,693
-Oh no, I'm sorry, Daddy,
I'm only here for a few days.

108
00:07:23,693 --> 00:07:24,527
Listen.

109
00:07:24,527 --> 00:07:27,822
I met this guy.

110
00:07:27,822 --> 00:07:30,408
He's a medical student
at Harvard University,

111
00:07:30,408 --> 00:07:33,620
and he wants me to meet
his parents on the Cape.

112
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:34,871
-The Cape.

113
00:07:34,871 --> 00:07:36,539
-It's just this place where
they have a vacation--

114
00:07:36,539 --> 00:07:37,916
-We know where the
Cape is, all right?

115
00:07:37,916 --> 00:07:39,876
You always talk to us like
we're a bunch of bumpkins.

116
00:07:39,876 --> 00:07:43,421
-Well in your case, that
would be about eight steps up.

117
00:07:43,421 --> 00:07:44,673
-Yeah well you're
the one that sounds

118
00:07:44,673 --> 00:07:46,508
like you just got
off some banana boat.

119
00:07:46,508 --> 00:07:47,884
Look I gotta get
out of here, I think

120
00:07:47,884 --> 00:07:49,260
my stomach is going to be fixed.

121
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:51,513
-You take that radio and
you get the $10 back,

122
00:07:51,513 --> 00:07:52,555
you hear me, Ricky?

123
00:07:52,555 --> 00:07:54,557
-Listen, I promised
Chris I'd call him.

124
00:07:54,557 --> 00:07:58,061
We'll talk some more later, OK?

125
00:07:58,061 --> 00:08:01,690
You look beautiful.

126
00:08:01,690 --> 00:08:03,942
Oh, Daddy, everything has
gotten so expensive up there.

127
00:08:03,942 --> 00:08:09,322
I'm going to need another
$2,000 when I leave, OK?

128
00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:10,115
-$2,000?

129
00:08:10,115 --> 00:08:11,074
Did she that?

130
00:08:11,074 --> 00:08:12,534
Where am I going to get $2,000?

131
00:08:12,534 --> 00:08:13,868
-You're asking me?

132
00:08:13,868 --> 00:08:15,829
You're the one who created
little Ms. Frankenstein

133
00:08:15,829 --> 00:08:17,872
by never telling
her what is really

134
00:08:17,872 --> 00:08:19,499
going on around here, Frank.

135
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:21,167
-What's so wrong with that, huh?

136
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:23,169
I want her to grow up
without worrying about money

137
00:08:23,169 --> 00:08:25,630
and I want her to grow
up with confidence.

138
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:28,341
You know, in one
more year she's going

139
00:08:28,341 --> 00:08:30,552
to be the only member of
either of our families

140
00:08:30,552 --> 00:08:32,429
to have graduated from college.

141
00:08:32,429 --> 00:08:34,472
-That's great, she'll be
the first college graduate,

142
00:08:34,472 --> 00:08:36,141
and I'll be the first
one in my family

143
00:08:36,141 --> 00:08:38,435
that ever has to go
on welfare, right?

144
00:08:38,435 --> 00:08:41,521
-Nobody's going on welfare
in this family, OK?

145
00:08:44,858 --> 00:08:46,443
MANNY: I could get you
22 of these, all right?

146
00:08:46,443 --> 00:08:49,070
Blue, green, or maroon?

147
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:50,113
-What about gray?

148
00:08:50,113 --> 00:08:52,323
You know, my wife,
she likes gray.

149
00:08:52,323 --> 00:08:53,575
-You don't want gray.

150
00:08:53,575 --> 00:08:55,201
Take a look around, huh?

151
00:08:55,201 --> 00:08:56,745
See any gray around here?

152
00:08:56,745 --> 00:08:58,747
These are tropical people.

153
00:08:58,747 --> 00:09:01,082
We're talking maroon, we're
talking green like vegetation.

154
00:09:01,082 --> 00:09:05,086
Blue, like the sky or the ocean.

155
00:09:05,086 --> 00:09:06,588
When I got you all
those suitcases

156
00:09:06,588 --> 00:09:08,089
and you couldn't
move them all, huh?

157
00:09:08,089 --> 00:09:10,717
Didn't I take the
rest of them back?

158
00:09:10,717 --> 00:09:12,802
You're going to have
to trust me on this.

159
00:09:12,802 --> 00:09:14,304
You're going to
take 22 of these.

160
00:09:14,304 --> 00:09:15,472
I guarantee you're
moving them out

161
00:09:15,472 --> 00:09:17,390
of here in four weeks, tops.

162
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:19,476
I'll even throw in a gray
suit, free of charge all right,

163
00:09:19,476 --> 00:09:22,771
so you can wear it around the
house and make your wife happy.

164
00:09:22,771 --> 00:09:24,314
-Double breasted.

165
00:09:24,314 --> 00:09:26,816
My wife, she likes
double breasted.

166
00:09:26,816 --> 00:09:29,027
-I'll see what I can do, OK?

167
00:09:29,027 --> 00:09:30,779
You think the two of
these on consignment,

168
00:09:30,779 --> 00:09:34,949
we'll settle up when I bring
the rest in a couple days.

169
00:09:34,949 --> 00:09:39,287
[speaking spanish]

170
00:09:39,287 --> 00:09:41,456
-Got the radios here,
radios right here, c'mon.

171
00:09:41,456 --> 00:09:44,000
Let's go, ladies and gentlemen,
we got radios here. $40,

172
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,084
all sales are final.

173
00:09:45,084 --> 00:09:46,211
Radios, radios, radios.

174
00:09:46,211 --> 00:09:48,505
Radios are right here,
radios are right here.

175
00:09:48,505 --> 00:09:50,590
Let's go.

176
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:52,842
Ladies and gentlemen.

177
00:09:52,842 --> 00:09:53,927
Radios, radios.

178
00:09:53,927 --> 00:09:55,303
-What are you guys doing?

179
00:09:55,303 --> 00:09:56,805
-Man, we're trying to get paid.

180
00:09:56,805 --> 00:09:57,764
-You best show some respect.

181
00:09:57,764 --> 00:09:58,640
Relax.

182
00:09:58,640 --> 00:09:59,808
Hey, do you want a radio?

183
00:09:59,808 --> 00:10:00,809
-No, forget about it.

184
00:10:00,809 --> 00:10:01,851
You know Manny only goes legit.

185
00:10:01,851 --> 00:10:02,644
-Right, right.

186
00:10:02,644 --> 00:10:03,853
-Yeah, you know what?

187
00:10:03,853 --> 00:10:05,480
I bet you pay all sorts of
taxes for that stuff you

188
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:06,564
get over in the
Garment District.

189
00:10:06,564 --> 00:10:08,149
-Yeah, I pay taxes all
right, and you guys

190
00:10:08,149 --> 00:10:09,526
are going to get
yourselves busted.

191
00:10:09,526 --> 00:10:10,902
-No one's going to get busted.

192
00:10:10,902 --> 00:10:14,364
Man, just yesterday, I sold a
cop a blown one for $50, man.

193
00:10:14,364 --> 00:10:15,532
Come on.

194
00:10:15,532 --> 00:10:16,241
-Let me see that.

195
00:10:19,536 --> 00:10:20,703
All right, I'll
give you $20 for it.

196
00:10:20,703 --> 00:10:21,996
-Nah, just forget
about it, all right?

197
00:10:21,996 --> 00:10:23,998
Why don't you just go
to Macy's and pay $200,

198
00:10:23,998 --> 00:10:25,875
that way you can get yourself
a warranty and everything?

199
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:26,668
-All right.

200
00:10:26,668 --> 00:10:27,377
Here's your $40.

201
00:10:30,755 --> 00:10:31,506
-This is--

202
00:10:35,718 --> 00:10:37,387
-You better explain to
these coconut-eaten punks

203
00:10:37,387 --> 00:10:38,721
who runs this neighborhood.

204
00:10:43,226 --> 00:10:44,561
-Now listen.

205
00:10:44,561 --> 00:10:46,396
You little punks are going to
have to learn early that you

206
00:10:46,396 --> 00:10:47,647
don't do nothing in
this neighborhood

207
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:48,982
without giving me my cut, eh?

208
00:10:48,982 --> 00:10:49,732
Capisce?

209
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:57,574
I'll blind you, I'll blind you,
you do that again you little--

210
00:10:57,574 --> 00:11:00,243
-C'mon, you know better.

211
00:11:00,243 --> 00:11:01,828
-Y'all can't be doing that shit.

212
00:11:01,828 --> 00:11:05,081
How come you don't
have to pay him?

213
00:11:05,081 --> 00:11:06,875
-Put it down.

214
00:11:06,875 --> 00:11:08,001
Put it down, Loco.

215
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:13,006
-Everybody pays him.

216
00:11:13,006 --> 00:11:13,923
Come here.

217
00:11:13,923 --> 00:11:15,884
I got to talk to you.

218
00:11:15,884 --> 00:11:17,260
-Damn.

219
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:18,928
MANNY: Look, Ricky, I want you
to forget about that guy, OK?

220
00:11:18,928 --> 00:11:20,179
His days are numbered anyway.

221
00:11:20,179 --> 00:11:21,431
-What do you mean?

222
00:11:21,431 --> 00:11:22,765
-Hey, he's been skimming
off some fence, they think.

223
00:11:22,765 --> 00:11:23,933
Word on the street
is that they're

224
00:11:23,933 --> 00:11:25,602
going to put the hit
on him any day now.

225
00:11:25,602 --> 00:11:27,103
Maybe you should introduce
me to these guys,

226
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:29,606
because I hit that
fat pig myself.

227
00:11:29,606 --> 00:11:31,107
Ricky.

228
00:11:31,107 --> 00:11:33,860
I wrote your sister a couple
times, she hasn't answered me.

229
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:35,737
You heard anything from her?

230
00:11:35,737 --> 00:11:36,779
-Hey look, Manny.

231
00:11:36,779 --> 00:11:38,114
You're all right, you're
always looking out

232
00:11:38,114 --> 00:11:40,742
for me and everything, so
I'm going to do you a solid.

233
00:11:40,742 --> 00:11:42,744
You don't want any
of that anymore.

234
00:11:42,744 --> 00:11:43,703
-Why?

235
00:11:43,703 --> 00:11:45,455
-Because she's
buggin', that's why.

236
00:11:45,455 --> 00:11:46,414
You should see her, man.

237
00:11:46,414 --> 00:11:47,457
I think they
short-circuited her up

238
00:11:47,457 --> 00:11:48,666
in that college or something.

239
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:49,959
-When did you see her?

240
00:11:49,959 --> 00:11:51,169
You went to Boston?

241
00:11:51,169 --> 00:11:52,545
-Nah, man, she's home.

242
00:11:52,545 --> 00:11:54,464
Look, I got to get back before
they think I split on them.

243
00:11:54,464 --> 00:11:55,298
I'll catch you later.

244
00:11:55,298 --> 00:11:56,716
-Yeah, OK.

245
00:11:56,716 --> 00:11:58,509
All right.

246
00:11:58,509 --> 00:11:59,719
-Listen.

247
00:11:59,719 --> 00:12:02,388
I talked to Chris and he
said his family is really

248
00:12:02,388 --> 00:12:04,515
looking forward to meeting me.

249
00:12:04,515 --> 00:12:05,808
-Yeah, how about us?

250
00:12:05,808 --> 00:12:07,518
When do we get to me him?

251
00:12:07,518 --> 00:12:10,355
-Um, uh, sure, I'll see if
I can work something out.

252
00:12:13,608 --> 00:12:15,360
I can't believe you guys
are still buying this stuff.

253
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:17,153
Don't you have any arugula?

254
00:12:17,153 --> 00:12:18,655
-Arugula what?

255
00:12:18,655 --> 00:12:20,573
-Or romaine, even?

256
00:12:20,573 --> 00:12:21,449
Look at this.

257
00:12:21,449 --> 00:12:23,409
I can't make the
salad from this.

258
00:12:23,409 --> 00:12:24,786
I'm going to have to go out.

259
00:12:24,786 --> 00:12:25,828
See you later.

260
00:12:28,539 --> 00:12:32,001
-How long did she say
she's going to be here?

261
00:12:32,001 --> 00:12:34,253
-No, maybe she's right.

262
00:12:34,253 --> 00:12:37,048
Maybe that's what's wrong.

263
00:12:37,048 --> 00:12:38,883
Maybe it's time we
started to learn

264
00:12:38,883 --> 00:12:40,843
something from our children.

265
00:12:40,843 --> 00:12:41,970
-Oh, yeah.

266
00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:44,347
I'm sure we could learn
something from them.

267
00:12:44,347 --> 00:12:46,975
From this one, we
could learn how

268
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:49,268
to hotwire a car in
two seconds flat.

269
00:12:49,268 --> 00:12:51,020
-What, I was just
hoping el Loco's mother

270
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:52,730
put a gate on her kitchen
window, all right?

271
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:53,815
-Look.

272
00:12:53,815 --> 00:12:56,067
Wash up, go down to
Gilberto's, pick up

273
00:12:56,067 --> 00:12:58,569
some eggs, a couple
of frozen chickens.

274
00:12:58,569 --> 00:13:00,989
See if he can give you a couple
of those six-packs of pork

275
00:13:00,989 --> 00:13:02,573
chops and tell him we'll
pay him next week, huh?

276
00:13:02,573 --> 00:13:04,367
-Come on Pop, I don't want
to go back over there,

277
00:13:04,367 --> 00:13:06,202
he says you already owe
him a bunch of money.

278
00:13:06,202 --> 00:13:08,371
-Never mind, I'll go over
there later and do it myself.

279
00:13:08,371 --> 00:13:10,039
-I'll go, OK?

280
00:13:10,039 --> 00:13:11,874
-Oh no, don't do me any favors.

281
00:13:11,874 --> 00:13:15,545
You would think I'm the only
one around here who remembers

282
00:13:15,545 --> 00:13:17,630
that a family is supposed
to help each other!

283
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:18,965
-I said I'd go.

restaurant is now having no

292
00:13:40,570 --> 00:13:43,281
Sir, I understand that you and
your wife are here in New York

293
00:13:43,281 --> 00:13:45,199
celebrating your 50th
wedding anniversary,

294
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:49,912
and have been waiting for a
table for close to two hours.

295
00:13:49,912 --> 00:13:51,497
Why did you choose this
particular restaurant?

296
00:13:51,497 --> 00:13:52,915
MAN (ON TV):What,
are you kidding?

297
00:13:52,915 --> 00:13:53,791
We're from Omaha.

MAN (ON TV): Well, if you
want to know something,

302
00:14:01,674 --> 00:14:04,260
I must have driven past this
place over a thousand times

303
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:06,262
just this week
alone, and never once

304
00:14:06,262 --> 00:14:08,264
did I think about going inside.

305
00:14:08,264 --> 00:14:10,099
But these guys--
and I think we all

306
00:14:10,099 --> 00:14:12,268
know who we're talking about--
if they come in here to eat,

307
00:14:12,268 --> 00:14:17,398
you'd better believe this place
has got one hell of a kitchen.

308
00:14:17,398 --> 00:14:18,441
-Look at that.

309
00:14:18,441 --> 00:14:19,776
Everything time one
of these Mobsters

310
00:14:19,776 --> 00:14:21,861
gets hit in a restaurant,
it's like the restaurant

311
00:14:21,861 --> 00:14:24,197
hit the lottery.

312
00:14:24,197 --> 00:14:25,531
-I know someone that's
about to get hit.

313
00:14:25,531 --> 00:14:26,324
-What?

314
00:14:26,324 --> 00:14:27,116
-What?

315
00:14:27,116 --> 00:14:28,117
-What are you talking about?

316
00:14:28,117 --> 00:14:29,243
-Yeah.

317
00:14:29,243 --> 00:14:30,912
-I know this fat Mafia
guy that's about to get

318
00:14:30,912 --> 00:14:32,121
wiped any day now.

319
00:14:32,121 --> 00:14:32,955
-You see?

320
00:14:32,955 --> 00:14:34,624
I hope you're listening to this.

321
00:14:34,624 --> 00:14:36,626
Go ahead and listen to
your 15 year-old son

322
00:14:36,626 --> 00:14:39,295
talking about somebody
getting wiped.

323
00:14:39,295 --> 00:14:40,922
-Look, the guy's a goner anyway.

324
00:14:40,922 --> 00:14:43,841
Look all I'm saying is that
if he got hit wiped in here,

325
00:14:43,841 --> 00:14:46,135
we'd be doing business
just like that place on TV.

326
00:14:46,135 --> 00:14:47,678
And why you giving
me a hard time?

327
00:14:47,678 --> 00:14:49,305
It was Pop that said it.

328
00:14:49,305 --> 00:14:50,139
-Hey, hey, hey.

329
00:14:50,139 --> 00:14:51,808
That was just talk, all right?

330
00:14:51,808 --> 00:14:54,560
Nobody expected you to
have a plan all worked out.

331
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,604
And how do you know about
these things, anyways?

332
00:14:56,604 --> 00:14:57,396
Huh?

333
00:14:57,396 --> 00:14:58,189
-Everybody knows.

334
00:14:58,189 --> 00:14:59,607
It's all over the street.

335
00:14:59,607 --> 00:15:02,276
-Well maybe you should spend
more time at home and less time

336
00:15:02,276 --> 00:15:03,111
in the street.

337
00:15:03,111 --> 00:15:04,320
You're grounded for two days.

338
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:05,154
-What?

339
00:15:05,154 --> 00:15:05,822
-Yeah!

340
00:15:08,825 --> 00:15:09,534
-Nydia!

341
00:15:13,079 --> 00:15:14,789
Nydia.

342
00:15:14,789 --> 00:15:16,666
-Manny, god.

343
00:15:16,666 --> 00:15:19,043
You scared the hell
out of me, you know?

344
00:15:19,043 --> 00:15:20,336
-I went by the restaurant.

345
00:15:20,336 --> 00:15:21,796
Your mother said you want
out to get something to eat

346
00:15:21,796 --> 00:15:23,673
and I thought you
might come by here.

347
00:15:23,673 --> 00:15:25,716
Remember when we used to
eat here all the time?

348
00:15:25,716 --> 00:15:26,551
-Yeah.

349
00:15:26,551 --> 00:15:28,678
That was a long time ago, Manny.

350
00:15:28,678 --> 00:15:30,513
-So how long are you here for?

351
00:15:30,513 --> 00:15:31,806
-Just for a couple of days.

352
00:15:31,806 --> 00:15:35,518
I have to get back and
prepare some stuff for school.

353
00:15:35,518 --> 00:15:37,228
-I-- I wrote you
a couple of times.

354
00:15:37,228 --> 00:15:38,062
Um.

355
00:15:38,062 --> 00:15:41,107
How come you didn't answer me?

356
00:15:41,107 --> 00:15:43,359
-Manny.

357
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:44,569
I was going to call
you today and--

358
00:15:44,569 --> 00:15:46,028
-So, you go back when?

359
00:15:46,028 --> 00:15:47,196
Tomorrow?

360
00:15:47,196 --> 00:15:48,948
-No, no, no, no, the
following day, but listen.

361
00:15:48,948 --> 00:15:50,324
This is important.

362
00:15:50,324 --> 00:15:51,784
-I have to go downtown
to pick up some stuff

363
00:15:51,784 --> 00:15:53,494
but maybe, um, maybe we
can get together later.

364
00:15:53,494 --> 00:15:55,204
Do some dinner, catch
a movie or something.

365
00:15:55,204 --> 00:15:56,080
-For tonight?

366
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:57,039
I can't.

367
00:15:57,039 --> 00:15:59,375
I'm spending time
with my family.

368
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:00,835
Can we just talk on the phone?

369
00:16:00,835 --> 00:16:02,295
-Um.

370
00:16:02,295 --> 00:16:03,713
Yeah, yeah, sure.

371
00:16:03,713 --> 00:16:06,090
-Look, I have to go.

372
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:06,966
I'll call you.

373
00:16:12,221 --> 00:16:14,432
-I like your hair like that.

374
00:16:14,432 --> 00:16:15,391
-Oh, my--

375
00:16:15,391 --> 00:16:16,934
[chuckles]

376
00:16:16,934 --> 00:16:17,685
Thank you.

377
00:16:23,566 --> 00:16:25,985
[pounding noise]

378
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:27,278
-The hell is that?

379
00:16:27,278 --> 00:16:28,070
-I don't know.

380
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:31,073
Go see.

381
00:16:31,073 --> 00:16:34,035
[pounding]

382
00:16:39,916 --> 00:16:41,417
-Stay here.

383
00:16:41,417 --> 00:16:44,253
[pounding]

384
00:17:12,114 --> 00:17:13,824
-Hey, what a nice surprise.

385
00:17:13,824 --> 00:17:14,825
-Open up, Frank.

386
00:17:14,825 --> 00:17:17,578
It's deadbeat clean up day.

387
00:17:17,578 --> 00:17:19,038
-What are you talking about?

388
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:21,791
I thought you said I
had three more weeks!

389
00:17:21,791 --> 00:17:24,460
-Correction-- you said
you had three more weeks.

390
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:25,962
Open them up.

391
00:17:25,962 --> 00:17:26,796
-All right!

392
00:17:26,796 --> 00:17:27,630
Wait, wait, wait a minute!

393
00:17:27,630 --> 00:17:30,466
Wait!

394
00:17:30,466 --> 00:17:32,051
All right, yeah, yeah.

395
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:34,470
Yeah, come on in and sit down.

396
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:36,430
Listen, I-- I'll brew
us a cup of coffee.

397
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:38,975
I'm sure we can
work something out!

398
00:17:38,975 --> 00:17:41,894
-Thanks, we all
ready had our coffee.

399
00:17:41,894 --> 00:17:42,812
This ain't nothing personal.

400
00:17:42,812 --> 00:17:44,021
You people are
just going to have

401
00:17:44,021 --> 00:17:45,314
to learn how to carry
your own weight.

402
00:17:45,314 --> 00:17:46,440
-Hey, we carry our weight.

403
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:47,858
And you people better
get the hell out of here

404
00:17:47,858 --> 00:17:49,193
before I beat the crap out you!

405
00:17:49,193 --> 00:17:50,152
-Hey!

406
00:17:50,152 --> 00:17:51,070
How many times I
got to tell you I

407
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:51,988
don't want you
talking like that.

408
00:17:51,988 --> 00:17:53,322
Now go upstairs, Ricky!

409
00:17:53,322 --> 00:17:55,116
-Don't forget the corner tables.

410
00:17:55,116 --> 00:17:57,451
-What's going on here?

411
00:17:57,451 --> 00:17:59,328
-We're behind on the payments.

412
00:17:59,328 --> 00:18:00,913
-Still, you can't
just come in here

413
00:18:00,913 --> 00:18:02,748
and clean out the restaurant.

414
00:18:02,748 --> 00:18:03,874
-These are my tables, lady.

415
00:18:03,874 --> 00:18:06,168
I'll do whatever
the hell I want.

416
00:18:06,168 --> 00:18:07,336
-Do you have papers?

417
00:18:07,336 --> 00:18:08,421
-Yeah.

418
00:18:08,421 --> 00:18:10,548
I have papers-- about
six bounced checks.

419
00:18:10,548 --> 00:18:14,635
-You've obviously never heard
of a writ of habeas corpus.

420
00:18:14,635 --> 00:18:15,511
-A writ of what?

421
00:18:15,511 --> 00:18:16,345
What is that?

422
00:18:16,345 --> 00:18:18,222
Puerto Rican for dead beats?

423
00:18:18,222 --> 00:18:19,515
-It's a legal term.

424
00:18:19,515 --> 00:18:22,935
And what it means is that
once credit has been granted

425
00:18:22,935 --> 00:18:25,938
in any amount of down
payment, or monthly payments

426
00:18:25,938 --> 00:18:28,482
has been made towards the
purchase of the merchandise,

427
00:18:28,482 --> 00:18:30,526
that the person
making those payments

428
00:18:30,526 --> 00:18:33,654
is a legal partial owner
of the merchandise.

429
00:18:33,654 --> 00:18:36,157
And that the creditor must
first petition the court

430
00:18:36,157 --> 00:18:37,533
before repossession is allowed.

431
00:18:37,533 --> 00:18:39,035
-Oh, really?

432
00:18:39,035 --> 00:18:40,411
-That's right.

433
00:18:40,411 --> 00:18:43,164
Do you have even one receipt
of payments for these tables?

434
00:18:43,164 --> 00:18:44,707
-I have a bunch of them.

435
00:18:47,626 --> 00:18:48,377
Here.

436
00:18:54,216 --> 00:18:57,678
-What you're doing here,
whatever your name is,

437
00:18:57,678 --> 00:18:59,055
is illegal.

438
00:18:59,055 --> 00:19:00,806
I can get on that
phone right now

439
00:19:00,806 --> 00:19:03,851
and have you charged with
forcible entry and harassment.

440
00:19:03,851 --> 00:19:06,729
And by the time you're finished
paying your court costs,

441
00:19:06,729 --> 00:19:09,565
you're going to wish you gave
him those tables for free.

442
00:19:09,565 --> 00:19:10,900
-Yeah.

443
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:13,903
She's, uh, studying business
at Boston University, huh?

444
00:19:13,903 --> 00:19:15,404
Pretty good, huh?

445
00:19:15,404 --> 00:19:17,406
-By the way, the
prosecutor's office

446
00:19:17,406 --> 00:19:19,283
love it when these kind
of charges are made.

447
00:19:19,283 --> 00:19:22,161
Because whether the
complaints stick or not,

448
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:24,121
it's an excuse to look
through your books.

449
00:19:24,121 --> 00:19:26,749
So I just hope you have
everything in order.

450
00:19:29,668 --> 00:19:31,921
-You got three
weeks and that's it.

451
00:19:31,921 --> 00:19:33,464
RICKY: Hey, it's
nothing personal.

452
00:19:33,464 --> 00:19:35,424
You people are just going to
have to get your shit together

453
00:19:35,424 --> 00:19:37,259
before you come half
stepping into this place.

454
00:19:37,259 --> 00:19:40,888
-How many times I got to tell
you stop talking like that?

455
00:19:40,888 --> 00:19:43,516
-So what do you think of an
American education now, huh?

456
00:19:43,516 --> 00:19:45,851
-No, this whole thing
is embarrassing, Daddy.

457
00:19:45,851 --> 00:19:47,853
The only good thing is that
everyone in this neighborhood

458
00:19:47,853 --> 00:19:49,480
is still asleep.

459
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:52,316
I don't understand how you
let things get like this.

460
00:19:52,316 --> 00:19:53,651
-It's easy.

461
00:19:53,651 --> 00:19:55,111
You just write a check and
there's no money in the bank.

462
00:19:55,111 --> 00:19:56,612
What's so hard to
understand about that?

463
00:19:56,612 --> 00:20:00,032
-You should at least be
making partial payments, Mom.

464
00:20:00,032 --> 00:20:03,285
I'll take a look
at the books later.

465
00:20:03,285 --> 00:20:04,787
-What's the matter with her?

466
00:20:04,787 --> 00:20:07,206
I thought going to college it
was supposed to make you smart.

467
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:09,708
Didn't she hear me say
there's no money in the bank?

468
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:13,462
-Next the stove and refrigerator
guys are going to show up.

469
00:20:13,462 --> 00:20:15,589
And they're not going
to want to hear anything

470
00:20:15,589 --> 00:20:18,968
about no Corpus Christi stuff.

471
00:20:18,968 --> 00:20:19,677
That'll be it.

472
00:20:50,374 --> 00:20:51,584
Come on down here.

473
00:20:51,584 --> 00:20:52,334
We're going to have
a family meeting.

474
00:20:52,334 --> 00:20:53,085
-What are you doing?

475
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:58,424
-Now we've had this
place for, what?

476
00:20:58,424 --> 00:20:59,216
Five?

477
00:20:59,216 --> 00:21:00,009
-Six.

478
00:21:00,009 --> 00:21:01,510
-Six years.

479
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:04,597
Most of the time it's
been pretty good.

480
00:21:04,597 --> 00:21:06,474
Now things have changed.

481
00:21:06,474 --> 00:21:08,684
Now hardly nobody
from around here

482
00:21:08,684 --> 00:21:10,519
can afford too go
out to a restaurant.

483
00:21:10,519 --> 00:21:13,355
So we've got think of
something to attract

484
00:21:13,355 --> 00:21:16,358
people outside
this neighborhood.

485
00:21:16,358 --> 00:21:18,319
People who can still
afford to go out.

486
00:21:18,319 --> 00:21:21,739
-First of all, the kind of
people you're talking about

487
00:21:21,739 --> 00:21:25,201
are not going to come over
here to eat beef and pig ears.

488
00:21:25,201 --> 00:21:28,704
People are more
health conscious now.

489
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:31,248
-I really appreciate what
you did with the table guy.

490
00:21:31,248 --> 00:21:33,417
But this is a Puerto
Rican restaurant

491
00:21:33,417 --> 00:21:36,212
and neither your mother
nor me know anything

492
00:21:36,212 --> 00:21:39,215
about arugula or
Romaine lettuces, OK?

493
00:21:39,215 --> 00:21:40,883
And another thing.

494
00:21:40,883 --> 00:21:43,802
Up to now, your
mother and I, we've

495
00:21:43,802 --> 00:21:45,721
been doing pretty
good around here.

496
00:21:45,721 --> 00:21:47,181
And just because
you went to college

497
00:21:47,181 --> 00:21:48,891
doesn't give you no
right to treat us

498
00:21:48,891 --> 00:21:50,476
like some campesinos
from the mountains.

499
00:21:50,476 --> 00:21:51,477
-That's not what I meant--

500
00:21:51,477 --> 00:21:53,896
-Look, I have an idea.

501
00:21:53,896 --> 00:21:57,399
Or should I say
Ricky has an idea.

502
00:21:57,399 --> 00:22:01,278
-I-- I want you all to know
that this isn't something that I

503
00:22:01,278 --> 00:22:04,949
would be thinking if there
was any other choice.

504
00:22:04,949 --> 00:22:09,119
I think that we should do what
Ricky suggested yesterday.

505
00:22:09,119 --> 00:22:10,788
-Oh my god, Frank!

506
00:22:10,788 --> 00:22:12,081
What are you thinking?

507
00:22:12,081 --> 00:22:14,792
Have you completely
lost your mind?

508
00:22:14,792 --> 00:22:16,544
-Way to go, Dad.

509
00:22:16,544 --> 00:22:17,336
-What?

510
00:22:17,336 --> 00:22:18,587
What's he talking about?

511
00:22:18,587 --> 00:22:21,298
-He wants something fat
Mafia guy Ricky knows

512
00:22:21,298 --> 00:22:23,092
to come over here so
they can kill him.

513
00:22:23,092 --> 00:22:26,387
So we can have more business
like this guy in the newspaper.

514
00:22:26,387 --> 00:22:28,931
-I'm not talking
about killing a guy.

515
00:22:28,931 --> 00:22:31,600
There's already a
contract out on him.

516
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,185
We don't have to lift a finger.

517
00:22:33,185 --> 00:22:34,478
Only thing we've
got to do is make

518
00:22:34,478 --> 00:22:37,106
sure that the guys in the
restaurant when he gets it.

519
00:22:37,106 --> 00:22:38,649
Then our troubles will be over.

520
00:22:38,649 --> 00:22:41,402
-This is not the way
people do business, Dad.

521
00:22:41,402 --> 00:22:43,362
You go out, you get
a loan application,

522
00:22:43,362 --> 00:22:45,114
and you take it to a bank.

523
00:22:45,114 --> 00:22:46,115
-Oh.

524
00:22:46,115 --> 00:22:47,700
You want to see a
loan application?

525
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:49,118
Is that what you want to see?

526
00:22:49,118 --> 00:22:50,077
OK.

527
00:22:50,077 --> 00:22:51,745
You want to see
loan applications.

528
00:22:51,745 --> 00:22:52,788
I have them here.

529
00:22:52,788 --> 00:22:54,123
Look.

530
00:22:54,123 --> 00:22:57,835
I have one here, I have another
one, I got two more of them

531
00:22:57,835 --> 00:22:58,627
right here.

532
00:22:58,627 --> 00:23:00,129
You see this bank right here?

533
00:23:00,129 --> 00:23:02,339
This bank has thrown me
out of it so many times

534
00:23:02,339 --> 00:23:04,341
that every time I go down
there, and they see me coming,

535
00:23:04,341 --> 00:23:06,427
they send a flunky to
tell me that the guy's not

536
00:23:06,427 --> 00:23:07,344
in his office.

537
00:23:07,344 --> 00:23:10,514
-What about a personal loan?

538
00:23:10,514 --> 00:23:11,890
-Well if you know
somebody, tell me.

539
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:13,976
Because all the people I know,
they're asking me for money.

540
00:23:13,976 --> 00:23:15,394
-What about those bonds
you bought that time?

541
00:23:18,606 --> 00:23:20,316
-They're gone a long time ago.

542
00:23:20,316 --> 00:23:21,942
NYDIA: This is crazy business.

543
00:23:21,942 --> 00:23:24,361
I absolutely refuse
to get involved

544
00:23:24,361 --> 00:23:25,279
with something like this.

545
00:23:25,279 --> 00:23:26,322
-OK.

546
00:23:26,322 --> 00:23:28,449
But before we put
this matter to rest,

547
00:23:28,449 --> 00:23:32,494
I think it's only fair
that I should tell you

548
00:23:32,494 --> 00:23:39,126
that if this restaurant doesn't
start making money soon, then

549
00:23:39,126 --> 00:23:40,502
I don't think you can
go back to school.

550
00:23:43,714 --> 00:23:46,383
-What do you mean?

551
00:23:46,383 --> 00:23:51,221
Are you trying to
say there's no money?

552
00:23:51,221 --> 00:23:54,016
I thought you always put
my tuition money aside.

553
00:23:54,016 --> 00:23:56,685
-We did.

554
00:23:56,685 --> 00:23:58,520
But we had to put
it back inside.

555
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:01,940
How do you think we've been
paying rent around here?

556
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:03,734
I'm sorry.

557
00:24:03,734 --> 00:24:05,819
That's the way it is.

558
00:24:05,819 --> 00:24:09,823
If we can't make this restaurant
work then everything ends.

559
00:24:12,493 --> 00:24:14,870
Including your school.

560
00:24:14,870 --> 00:24:16,538
I guess that's it, huh?

561
00:24:21,210 --> 00:24:26,924
-Wait a minute, let
me get this straight.

562
00:24:26,924 --> 00:24:36,475
So this is a really, really bad
man who maims and kills people?

563
00:24:36,475 --> 00:24:38,477
And did you say
there was all ready

564
00:24:38,477 --> 00:24:39,687
a contract out on this guy?

565
00:24:39,687 --> 00:24:40,479
CARMEN: Oh my god!

566
00:24:40,479 --> 00:24:41,939
What are you doing?

567
00:24:41,939 --> 00:24:43,607
What does school
matter if we all end up

568
00:24:43,607 --> 00:24:45,234
with prison numbers on our back?

569
00:24:45,234 --> 00:24:47,695
-Ma, stop being so dramatic.

570
00:24:47,695 --> 00:24:50,531
It's not like we're
killing the guy.

571
00:24:50,531 --> 00:24:52,783
So have you figured
out how you're

572
00:24:52,783 --> 00:24:54,159
going to get him in here?

573
00:24:58,997 --> 00:25:00,499
-So you want me to
help you do what?

574
00:25:00,499 --> 00:25:02,000
RICKY: Look, you know
how these guys are.

575
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,335
You know I can't just
walk up and invite

576
00:25:03,335 --> 00:25:04,920
them to the
restaurant by myself.

577
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:06,088
Just take me over there.

578
00:25:06,088 --> 00:25:06,922
-No.

579
00:25:06,922 --> 00:25:07,339
Forget it.

580
00:25:07,339 --> 00:25:08,048
Right?

581
00:25:08,048 --> 00:25:08,966
Those guys are wacko.

582
00:25:08,966 --> 00:25:10,092
And the best thing
you could do is

583
00:25:10,092 --> 00:25:11,427
to stay as far away as possible.

584
00:25:11,427 --> 00:25:13,220
-Look, I don't know what
you're so worried about, OK?

585
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:14,513
The guy's a goner.

586
00:25:14,513 --> 00:25:15,681
I mean what's he going to
do, kill you from the grave?

587
00:25:15,681 --> 00:25:17,224
-It's not just him
I'm worried about, OK?

588
00:25:17,224 --> 00:25:19,810
These guys don't like outsiders
messing around in the business.

589
00:25:19,810 --> 00:25:21,687
I'm sorry I ever
told you anything.

590
00:25:21,687 --> 00:25:23,147
-You know what,
let's just forget it.

591
00:25:23,147 --> 00:25:24,314
I'll find somebody
else to help me.

592
00:25:24,314 --> 00:25:25,357
-That's I'm saying.

593
00:25:25,357 --> 00:25:26,859
Look, you can't just
go around telling

594
00:25:26,859 --> 00:25:28,610
people your gonna do this!

595
00:25:28,610 --> 00:25:29,903
You're gonna end
up gettin' wasted.

596
00:25:29,903 --> 00:25:30,612
Ricky!

597
00:25:36,118 --> 00:25:37,661
-Let me do the talking, OK?

598
00:25:37,661 --> 00:25:38,620
-You better keep that
friggin' thing in your pants

599
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:39,830
and get back to
work, or we're gonna

600
00:25:39,830 --> 00:25:41,582
be collecting you from
the bottom of a dumpster.

601
00:25:41,582 --> 00:25:42,374
You get my drift.

602
00:25:42,374 --> 00:25:43,375
-Hey, Tony.

603
00:25:43,375 --> 00:25:44,376
-Get outta here.

604
00:25:44,376 --> 00:25:45,586
-How you guys doin'?

605
00:25:45,586 --> 00:25:46,962
-Hey, you remember Ricky
from the other day, right?

606
00:25:46,962 --> 00:25:48,005
-Yeah, how you doin'?

607
00:25:48,005 --> 00:25:49,173
-Oh, yeah, yeah, the
little scumbag who

608
00:25:49,173 --> 00:25:51,008
goes around ripping
off car radi--

609
00:25:51,008 --> 00:25:52,634
-Ooh!

610
00:25:52,634 --> 00:25:53,677
-You see this car?

611
00:25:53,677 --> 00:25:55,929
If I see as much as
a hubcap missing,

612
00:25:55,929 --> 00:25:57,556
I'm gonna save this
city money by sweeping

613
00:25:57,556 --> 00:25:59,349
the streets with the
back of your head.

614
00:25:59,349 --> 00:26:00,559
-Come on, Tony, look he's a kid.

615
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:01,935
All right, he wants
to apologize for being

616
00:26:01,935 --> 00:26:02,978
such a wise ass the other day.

617
00:26:02,978 --> 00:26:03,771
-Yeah, that's right.

618
00:26:03,771 --> 00:26:05,105
I just want to apologize.

619
00:26:05,105 --> 00:26:05,981
I didn't know who you were.

620
00:26:05,981 --> 00:26:06,940
-Well, now you do.

621
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:08,317
Get lost.

622
00:26:08,317 --> 00:26:09,693
-Listen, Tony, his family is
still worried your mad at 'em.

623
00:26:09,693 --> 00:26:10,652
You know.

624
00:26:10,652 --> 00:26:11,820
And they want to
make it up to you

625
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:13,197
by inviting you to dinner
at their restaurant.

626
00:26:13,197 --> 00:26:14,281
-Yeah, that's right.

627
00:26:14,281 --> 00:26:16,033
We want to invite
you to a nice dinner.

628
00:26:16,033 --> 00:26:17,451
-What are they kidding?

629
00:26:17,451 --> 00:26:20,412
Why would I want to go out and
eat of bowl of that Spic food?

630
00:26:20,412 --> 00:26:22,080
I'd be fartin' all day.

631
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:23,832
-Hey, ah, Tony, you
ever see my family?

632
00:26:23,832 --> 00:26:25,417
-Yous all look alike anyway.

633
00:26:28,378 --> 00:26:29,671
-That's my mother.

634
00:26:29,671 --> 00:26:34,510
My father, me, and that
right there is my sister.

635
00:26:34,510 --> 00:26:36,512
I just thought maybe you seen
them around or something.

636
00:26:36,512 --> 00:26:40,265
-No, no, no, I can honestly say
that I haven't, because believe

637
00:26:40,265 --> 00:26:43,018
me, garbanzos like that,
I would'a remembered.

638
00:26:43,018 --> 00:26:44,520
He he.

639
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:46,396
So where is this shit house?

640
00:26:46,396 --> 00:26:47,314
-Right on Second Avenue.

641
00:26:47,314 --> 00:26:48,106
You can't miss it.

642
00:26:48,106 --> 00:26:50,150
-We'll be there at 6:00.

643
00:26:50,150 --> 00:26:51,443
-We were thinking
about tomorrow!

644
00:26:55,364 --> 00:26:56,657
-Ricky, do you
remember if your mother

645
00:26:56,657 --> 00:26:57,533
put wine on the pork chops?

646
00:26:57,533 --> 00:26:58,367
-Yeah.

647
00:26:58,367 --> 00:26:59,243
I think so.

648
00:27:06,708 --> 00:27:09,127
-Dad, what are you doing?

649
00:27:09,127 --> 00:27:12,089
-You could have at least tried
to make this for tomorrow.

650
00:27:12,089 --> 00:27:14,550
-Hey, it's not like he
gave me a lot of choices.

651
00:27:14,550 --> 00:27:17,427
-Well, there's no way this
is going to be ready in time.

652
00:27:17,427 --> 00:27:19,930
Hey, are you gonna
give me a hand or not?

653
00:27:19,930 --> 00:27:21,807
-I told you I'm
staying out of this.

654
00:27:21,807 --> 00:27:24,643
Maybe the judge will
have mercy on me.

655
00:27:24,643 --> 00:27:26,562
-Pass me the sauce.

656
00:27:26,562 --> 00:27:29,398
-Oh!

657
00:27:29,398 --> 00:27:31,316
Damn!

658
00:27:31,316 --> 00:27:35,028
-I think that's gonna
need a bit more water.

659
00:27:35,028 --> 00:27:36,113
-OK!

660
00:27:36,113 --> 00:27:37,531
Both of you get out
of here before there's

661
00:27:37,531 --> 00:27:40,033
nothing left of this
restaurant to save.

662
00:27:40,033 --> 00:27:42,953
Nydia, get down here and
give me a hand with this.

663
00:27:42,953 --> 00:27:43,829
-Yeah.

664
00:27:43,829 --> 00:27:46,999
I know, Chris.

665
00:27:46,999 --> 00:27:49,543
I'm really very sorry.

666
00:27:49,543 --> 00:27:51,253
This has been
happening to Mother

667
00:27:51,253 --> 00:27:54,548
ever since Father died
in that boating accident.

668
00:27:54,548 --> 00:27:57,509
She'll be doing fine,
then without the least bit

669
00:27:57,509 --> 00:27:59,469
of warning, she'll
suffer another relapse.

670
00:28:02,389 --> 00:28:04,266
I know.

671
00:28:04,266 --> 00:28:07,644
If you could just extend my
apologies to your parents.

672
00:28:07,644 --> 00:28:10,772
This relapse is usually
last a couple of days.

673
00:28:10,772 --> 00:28:13,734
And I'll leave Argentina as soon
as I feel she is doing better.

674
00:28:13,734 --> 00:28:15,110
-Nydia!

675
00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:16,528
Nydia!

676
00:28:16,528 --> 00:28:18,363
Nydia!

677
00:28:18,363 --> 00:28:21,283
-I'll call you in
a couple of days.

678
00:28:21,283 --> 00:28:22,784
Love.

679
00:28:22,784 --> 00:28:25,746
I miss you too.

680
00:28:25,746 --> 00:28:28,332
Kisses.

681
00:28:28,332 --> 00:28:30,292
What!

682
00:28:30,292 --> 00:28:31,668
I'm coming!

683
00:28:31,668 --> 00:28:35,255
Jesus Christ, can anybody even
make a phone call around here?

684
00:28:35,255 --> 00:28:37,174
-Nydia, do you know if these
people like a lot of cilantro

685
00:28:37,174 --> 00:28:39,134
or a little cilantro
in their food?

686
00:28:39,134 --> 00:28:41,094
-How am I supposed to know, Mom?

687
00:28:41,094 --> 00:28:43,180
Why don't you ask the
street expert over here?

688
00:28:43,180 --> 00:28:46,141
Speaking of street
experts, does anybody

689
00:28:46,141 --> 00:28:47,726
know how it's
supposed to happen?

690
00:28:47,726 --> 00:28:49,978
-How, what's supposed to happen?

691
00:28:49,978 --> 00:28:52,314
-You know, the thing.

692
00:28:52,314 --> 00:28:53,148
The hit.

693
00:28:53,148 --> 00:28:54,399
Whatever you want to call it.

694
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:56,360
I mean, are they just going
to throw a bomb in here,

695
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:58,362
and blow us all to smithereens?

696
00:28:58,362 --> 00:29:00,280
That would really defeat the
purpose of this whole thing,

697
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:01,990
wouldn't it?

698
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:03,116
-I don't know.

699
00:29:03,116 --> 00:29:05,369
They'll probably do it
like in "The Godfather."

700
00:29:05,369 --> 00:29:08,455
Pacino just walked up to
that crooked captain and pow!

701
00:29:08,455 --> 00:29:10,791
A .45 slug right
through the head.

702
00:29:10,791 --> 00:29:11,667
-What's that other movie?

703
00:29:11,667 --> 00:29:12,626
Uh uh, Nice Fellows?

704
00:29:12,626 --> 00:29:13,585
-You mean "Goodfellas."

705
00:29:13,585 --> 00:29:14,670
-Yeah.

706
00:29:14,670 --> 00:29:15,754
Yeah, remember they
get a piece of wire.

707
00:29:15,754 --> 00:29:16,922
They wrap it around
the guy's neck,

708
00:29:16,922 --> 00:29:18,340
and they strangle him to death.

709
00:29:18,340 --> 00:29:21,677
-[spanish] "Goodfellas."

710
00:29:21,677 --> 00:29:23,845
I just can't believe you two
waited till the last minute

711
00:29:23,845 --> 00:29:24,888
to talk about this stuff.

712
00:29:24,888 --> 00:29:26,932
-Hey, we talking about
it now, all right?

713
00:29:26,932 --> 00:29:28,517
Because it might even
be a drive by like they

714
00:29:28,517 --> 00:29:30,102
did that guy on TV.

715
00:29:30,102 --> 00:29:31,645
Oh, we have to
make sure we don't

716
00:29:31,645 --> 00:29:32,604
get hit by any stray bullets.

717
00:29:32,604 --> 00:29:33,605
-Oh my God!

718
00:29:33,605 --> 00:29:35,190
That's it, Frank.

719
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:37,693
I can't do this.

720
00:29:37,693 --> 00:29:41,697
-I think it's a little
late for that, Ma.

721
00:29:41,697 --> 00:29:43,156
-Oh, whoa, open up over here.

722
00:29:43,156 --> 00:29:45,993
Are they here or what?

723
00:29:45,993 --> 00:29:48,870
-Oh my God.

724
00:29:48,870 --> 00:29:51,540
They're disgusting.

725
00:29:51,540 --> 00:29:55,669
--[spanish] And
there's three of 'em.

726
00:29:55,669 --> 00:29:58,005
[speaking spanish]

727
00:29:58,005 --> 00:30:00,590
-We don't have enough
food to feed them, Frank.

728
00:30:00,590 --> 00:30:03,885
-Well, we'll just put a
lot of bread on the table.

729
00:30:03,885 --> 00:30:07,472
And we gotta make sure that
they get clear shot at him.

730
00:30:07,472 --> 00:30:10,308
And if Ricky's right,
and it's a drive-by,

731
00:30:10,308 --> 00:30:12,519
whenever you see a
slow-moving vehicle in front

732
00:30:12,519 --> 00:30:14,730
of the restaurant, just get as
far away from it as possible.

733
00:30:14,730 --> 00:30:16,898
OK?

734
00:30:16,898 --> 00:30:17,607
Don't be nervous.

735
00:30:21,445 --> 00:30:23,864
-Hey, I'm glad we
made a reservation.

736
00:30:23,864 --> 00:30:25,032
-Good.

737
00:30:25,032 --> 00:30:27,784
And uh, hello, I'm Frank,
uh, Ricky's father.

738
00:30:27,784 --> 00:30:28,952
Welcome to the restaurant.

739
00:30:28,952 --> 00:30:30,829
Uh, it's truly an
honor to have you here.

740
00:30:30,829 --> 00:30:32,247
-Yeah, well you
should be honored.

741
00:30:32,247 --> 00:30:34,249
Cause it's the first time I ever
ate any of this mira-mira food.

742
00:30:34,249 --> 00:30:35,042
-Mira-mira food.

743
00:30:35,042 --> 00:30:36,877
Ha, ha, ha.

744
00:30:36,877 --> 00:30:37,836
Mira-mira food.

745
00:30:37,836 --> 00:30:39,296
That's very funny.

746
00:30:39,296 --> 00:30:40,589
-What the hell does
this here mean?

747
00:30:40,589 --> 00:30:41,923
What, Nydia's cutlets?

748
00:30:41,923 --> 00:30:42,758
-Oh, no, no.

749
00:30:42,758 --> 00:30:44,426
That, that's the
house specialty.

750
00:30:44,426 --> 00:30:46,094
That's Nydia's chuletas.

751
00:30:46,094 --> 00:30:47,971
That means Nydia's pork chops.

752
00:30:47,971 --> 00:30:50,891
I named that special
after my daughter, Nydia.

753
00:30:50,891 --> 00:30:54,102
-Oh, well, I can see why.

754
00:30:54,102 --> 00:30:58,148
So, uh, allow me
introduce myself.

755
00:30:58,148 --> 00:31:01,068
I'm Antonio Andolucci,
and I gotta say,

756
00:31:01,068 --> 00:31:04,404
it's an absolute pleasure
to make your acquaintance.

757
00:31:04,404 --> 00:31:06,448
-Uh, nice to meet you.

758
00:31:06,448 --> 00:31:09,117
-Eh, so, Lydia--

759
00:31:09,117 --> 00:31:10,327
-Nydia.

760
00:31:10,327 --> 00:31:11,411
-Whatever.

761
00:31:11,411 --> 00:31:13,330
When am I gonna be
able to taste them

762
00:31:13,330 --> 00:31:15,957
fabulous pork chops of yours?

763
00:31:15,957 --> 00:31:17,501
-I don't care who
the hell you are

764
00:31:17,501 --> 00:31:20,754
mister, but [speaking spanish]

765
00:31:20,754 --> 00:31:22,005
-You have to excuse my children.

766
00:31:22,005 --> 00:31:23,548
You know how kids are today.

767
00:31:23,548 --> 00:31:26,551
That's why I want to
apologize to you personally.

768
00:31:26,551 --> 00:31:28,178
-Oh, it's all right, Pancho.

769
00:31:28,178 --> 00:31:29,971
I like frisky women.

770
00:31:29,971 --> 00:31:30,806
-Come on this way.

771
00:31:30,806 --> 00:31:31,640
I have a table.

772
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:32,557
This way.

773
00:31:32,557 --> 00:31:33,642
Come, come, come.

774
00:31:33,642 --> 00:31:34,601
I have a table for you.

775
00:31:34,601 --> 00:31:35,393
Over here.

776
00:31:35,393 --> 00:31:37,187
Over here.

777
00:31:37,187 --> 00:31:39,648
We have a special table for you.

778
00:31:39,648 --> 00:31:40,440
Excuse me.

779
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:42,400
Excuse me.

780
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:43,193
Get down.

781
00:31:43,193 --> 00:31:43,944
Get down.

782
00:31:46,738 --> 00:31:47,489
-They got something.

783
00:31:54,830 --> 00:31:56,623
-I forgot the wine.

784
00:31:56,623 --> 00:31:59,751
-Ah, these Puerto Ricans are
the weirdest people I ever seen.

785
00:31:59,751 --> 00:32:01,753
-The wine.

786
00:32:01,753 --> 00:32:02,796
-Hey, Pop.

787
00:32:02,796 --> 00:32:03,880
Isn't that the table
where the plastic

788
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:04,923
keeps falling from the ceiling?

789
00:32:04,923 --> 00:32:05,715
-Yeah, yeah.

790
00:32:05,715 --> 00:32:06,800
That's right.

791
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:08,844
You know, I've been
meaning to fix that.

792
00:32:08,844 --> 00:32:10,220
-There's no plaster
on the ceiling.

793
00:32:10,220 --> 00:32:11,513
What plaster?

794
00:32:11,513 --> 00:32:12,848
-Well, you see.

795
00:32:12,848 --> 00:32:14,516
OK.

796
00:32:14,516 --> 00:32:17,978
To be honest with you, the
reason I want to sit over here

797
00:32:17,978 --> 00:32:19,521
is because it's
not every day I get

798
00:32:19,521 --> 00:32:22,941
a man of your importance
eating at my restaurant.

799
00:32:22,941 --> 00:32:27,112
And I'd like to show you
off a little, you see.

800
00:32:27,112 --> 00:32:29,406
We think it, we think
it'll be good for business.

801
00:32:29,406 --> 00:32:30,824
You understand.

802
00:32:30,824 --> 00:32:34,035
-Ah, well, heh, if there's one
thing I understand, believe me,

803
00:32:34,035 --> 00:32:35,662
it's business.

804
00:32:35,662 --> 00:32:37,289
And speaking of
business, how come

805
00:32:37,289 --> 00:32:39,708
you ain't paying
us no protection?

806
00:32:39,708 --> 00:32:40,500
-Protection?

807
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:41,960
-Yeah, protection.

808
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:43,962
Things can get
nasty around here.

809
00:32:43,962 --> 00:32:44,838
Arms can be broken.

810
00:32:44,838 --> 00:32:47,007
Heads can be split.

811
00:32:47,007 --> 00:32:47,966
A capisce?

812
00:32:47,966 --> 00:32:50,051
Put 'em down for $75 a week.

813
00:32:50,051 --> 00:32:52,345
-You got it, boss.

814
00:32:52,345 --> 00:32:54,055
-Ma, oh the mother's
got even better

815
00:32:54,055 --> 00:32:55,891
garbanzos than the daughter.

816
00:32:55,891 --> 00:32:56,808
-Not a bad ass either.

-[speaking spanish]

818
00:33:02,731 --> 00:33:03,857
-What's she saying?

819
00:33:03,857 --> 00:33:06,234
-She's just upset
because she couldn't find

820
00:33:06,234 --> 00:33:08,195
bigger pork chops
to prepare for you.

821
00:33:08,195 --> 00:33:11,031
Uh, she's very emotional
about her cooking.

822
00:33:11,031 --> 00:33:17,370
-[speaking spanish]

823
00:33:17,370 --> 00:33:20,290
-You'd better how to take
care of your woman, pal.

824
00:33:20,290 --> 00:33:22,417
-She feels that she's
too hard on herself.

825
00:33:22,417 --> 00:33:24,753
She doesn't feel
she's done a good job.

826
00:33:24,753 --> 00:33:26,504
-What is this shit?

827
00:33:26,504 --> 00:33:27,589
-Oh, this is the special.

828
00:33:27,589 --> 00:33:30,008
The chuletas with
the side of tostones.

829
00:33:30,008 --> 00:33:31,384
-Tostones?

830
00:33:31,384 --> 00:33:32,928
Ain't that pigs' balls?

831
00:33:32,928 --> 00:33:33,929
-No, no, no, no.

832
00:33:33,929 --> 00:33:34,721
No, no.

833
00:33:34,721 --> 00:33:35,597
That's cojones.

834
00:33:35,597 --> 00:33:36,431
Cojones.

835
00:33:36,431 --> 00:33:39,100
That is just fried banana.

836
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:39,893
Try it.

837
00:33:39,893 --> 00:33:43,521
You'll like it.

838
00:33:43,521 --> 00:33:45,941
-This shit ain't half bad.

839
00:33:45,941 --> 00:33:49,069
Oh, come on, hit

840
00:33:49,069 --> 00:33:49,778
Get out of here.

Hey, geez, leave something.

Eat every one of them there?

You sure this is pork, Pancho?

849

I've seen some cats
running around.

850
00:34:16,096 --> 00:34:16,972

851
00:34:16,972 --> 00:34:17,889

-Got any more pork?

Put some there.

00:34:40,954 --> 00:34:42,330
Oh they got more meat.

864
00:34:42,330 --> 00:34:43,498
What are you wasting
the meat for?

865
00:34:43,498 --> 00:34:45,417
-What about dessert, boss?

866
00:34:45,417 --> 00:34:46,251
-Nah.

You're gonna wanna go downtown.

Same time, same station.

883
00:35:09,316 --> 00:35:10,358
See ya' tomorrow night.

884
00:35:14,195 --> 00:35:17,115
-Are you sure you
want to do this, Mom?

885
00:35:17,115 --> 00:35:20,327
-Those animals have been coming
back every single day, Nydia.

886
00:35:20,327 --> 00:35:21,536
What are we supposed
to feed them with?

887
00:35:39,387 --> 00:35:41,389
-Hi.

888
00:35:41,389 --> 00:35:42,932
-What can I do you for?

889
00:35:42,932 --> 00:35:44,059
-How much will you
give me for this?

890
00:35:47,187 --> 00:35:49,022
That ring has been in our
family for three generations.

891
00:35:53,401 --> 00:35:54,861
-You never told me that.

892
00:35:54,861 --> 00:35:56,654
-It was your grandmother
Josefina's ring.

893
00:35:56,654 --> 00:35:58,073
If she knew what I was
going to use it for,

894
00:35:58,073 --> 00:35:59,282
she'd probably turn
over in her grave.

895
00:36:04,371 --> 00:36:06,373
-Here, take this instead.

896
00:36:06,373 --> 00:36:08,249
-What are you doing?

897
00:36:08,249 --> 00:36:09,626
-Chris gave me those, Ma.

898
00:36:09,626 --> 00:36:10,418
We'll get them out later.

899
00:36:14,297 --> 00:36:15,048
-Are you sure?

900
00:36:18,551 --> 00:36:20,512
-It's OK, Mom.

901
00:36:20,512 --> 00:36:21,262
Don't worry about it.

902
00:36:24,432 --> 00:36:25,225
-Ha, ha, ha, ha.

903
00:36:25,225 --> 00:36:26,518
-[flatulence]

904
00:36:26,518 --> 00:36:28,228
-You, boss, you want me to
break the China man's legs?

905
00:36:31,022 --> 00:36:33,358
-You break his legs,
we don't get the money.

906
00:36:33,358 --> 00:36:35,485
Do whatever in
the hell you want.

907
00:36:35,485 --> 00:36:39,239
-Are you sure there's a
contract out on this guy?

908
00:36:39,239 --> 00:36:40,240
-Yeah.

909
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:42,867
I even had Ricky
double-check with Manny

910
00:36:42,867 --> 00:36:45,370
yesterday just to make sure.

911
00:36:45,370 --> 00:36:46,579
-Ya' know, Hey Pancho.

912
00:36:46,579 --> 00:36:49,499
Next time bring us the
good shit, will ya'?

913
00:36:49,499 --> 00:36:52,502
Bring us some more
of that yucca shit.

914
00:36:52,502 --> 00:36:53,461
Ah oh.

915
00:36:53,461 --> 00:36:54,587
Not you.

916
00:36:54,587 --> 00:36:56,172
We didn't come here to
waited on by some loser.

917
00:36:56,172 --> 00:36:58,800
Let pork chop bring it over.

918
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:01,219
-Dear God!

919
00:37:01,219 --> 00:37:01,970
What is this nightmare?

920
00:37:08,059 --> 00:37:09,102
-You.

921
00:37:09,102 --> 00:37:09,811
Front and center.

922
00:37:14,816 --> 00:37:15,775
Get outta there.

923
00:37:15,775 --> 00:37:16,860
Arriba!

924
00:37:16,860 --> 00:37:17,318
-Come on.

925
00:37:17,318 --> 00:37:18,069
Arriba!

926
00:37:21,489 --> 00:37:24,451
-These are unquestionably one
of the finest set of pork chops

927
00:37:24,451 --> 00:37:27,871
I seen in my life.

928
00:37:27,871 --> 00:37:30,206
You see this yucca shit?

929
00:37:30,206 --> 00:37:35,170
It's nuttin' compared to a nice,
sweet, ripe coconut like that.

930
00:37:35,170 --> 00:37:35,962
Come on.

931
00:37:35,962 --> 00:37:36,796
Here, here.

932
00:37:36,796 --> 00:37:37,589
Here mira.

933
00:37:37,589 --> 00:37:38,339
Come here mira.

934
00:37:38,339 --> 00:37:39,674
Come on mira, mira, mira.

935
00:37:39,674 --> 00:37:42,802
Ya' know the only trouble
is that you're not Italian,

936
00:37:42,802 --> 00:37:47,849
and that means all we could do
is have hot, sweaty, steaming,

937
00:37:47,849 --> 00:37:50,768
dumping till we crap
kind of sex on the side.

938
00:37:58,276 --> 00:37:59,611
-Sorry.

939
00:37:59,611 --> 00:38:06,034
But we're all out of hot,
steamy, thumping sex right now.

940
00:38:06,034 --> 00:38:08,703
Maybe we can offer you
another vat of fries instead.

941
00:38:08,703 --> 00:38:12,373
-You gonna let her
get away with that?

942
00:38:12,373 --> 00:38:14,417
-Hey!

943
00:38:14,417 --> 00:38:15,710
Why don't you keep
your fat, disgusting

944
00:38:15,710 --> 00:38:17,962
little hands to yourself?

945
00:38:17,962 --> 00:38:19,714
[speaking spanish]

946
00:38:19,714 --> 00:38:22,091
-I love these
hot-tempered PR women.

947
00:38:32,393 --> 00:38:33,186
-Wait, wait.

948
00:38:33,186 --> 00:38:34,312
What are you doing?

949
00:38:34,312 --> 00:38:37,440
-I'm gonna go kill that
son-of-a-bitch myself.

950
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:38,733
-What are you, crazy?

951
00:38:38,733 --> 00:38:40,026
-Hey, didn't you people say
you had some soup for us?

952
00:38:40,026 --> 00:38:41,444
What's goin' on?

953
00:38:41,444 --> 00:38:43,404
-Soup?

954
00:38:43,404 --> 00:38:44,822
I'll give him soup.

955
00:38:44,822 --> 00:38:46,074
-Give me that soup!
Where are you going?

956
00:38:46,074 --> 00:38:47,283
-Get the hell out
of the way, Frank.

957
00:38:47,283 --> 00:38:50,119
I wanna give that
son-of-a-bitch the soup.

958
00:38:50,119 --> 00:38:50,912
-Hey!

959
00:38:50,912 --> 00:38:52,247
Tony wants his soup.

960
00:38:52,247 --> 00:38:53,790
-Ah, yeah, yeah, We know.

961
00:38:53,790 --> 00:38:55,917
We're just gettin'
it ready right now.

962
00:38:55,917 --> 00:38:56,793
Give me that soup.

963
00:38:56,793 --> 00:38:59,045
-Um, you can't, Frank.

964
00:38:59,045 --> 00:39:00,296
-Is there some kind
of problem here?

965
00:39:00,296 --> 00:39:01,631
-Oh no, no, no, no.

966
00:39:01,631 --> 00:39:03,800
She just thought it might need
to simmer a little longer.

967
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:05,301
-Just let it simmer
on the table, huh?

968
00:39:05,301 --> 00:39:06,344
And get some bowls.

969
00:39:06,344 --> 00:39:07,971
-Frank, you can't
give them the soup.

970
00:39:07,971 --> 00:39:09,847
-What are you, crazy?

971
00:39:09,847 --> 00:39:12,517
-No, but--

972
00:39:12,517 --> 00:39:14,310
-Soup's up, boss.

973
00:39:14,310 --> 00:39:16,062
Ah, it smells good.

974
00:39:16,062 --> 00:39:16,938
-Hurry up, I'm starving.

975
00:39:23,111 --> 00:39:25,613
-Let me ask you a
question, Frank.

976
00:39:25,613 --> 00:39:26,823
How much you and
your scumbag son

977
00:39:26,823 --> 00:39:28,783
make for messing up
other peoples' cars?

978
00:39:28,783 --> 00:39:30,535
-Oh we don't do any.
-Don't give me any of your crap.

979
00:39:30,535 --> 00:39:31,369
Huh?

980
00:39:31,369 --> 00:39:32,996
I know you got a thing going.

981
00:39:32,996 --> 00:39:34,372
After I finish it,
we're gonna figure out

982
00:39:34,372 --> 00:39:35,540
some additional
payments for you.

983
00:39:35,540 --> 00:39:36,916
Now get the hell outta here.

984
00:39:36,916 --> 00:39:38,126
-I'll get you something
to pour it in.

985
00:39:46,301 --> 00:39:47,552
-Give me a chance.

986
00:39:51,472 --> 00:39:52,181
-Come on, with this.

987
00:39:55,435 --> 00:39:56,394
Ah.

988
00:39:56,394 --> 00:39:58,730
-[slurp]

989
00:40:05,570 --> 00:40:09,032

00:40:09,032 --> 00:40:11,492

993
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:20,710
-Holy shit.

994
00:40:20,710 --> 00:40:24,505
They finally got
that spice right.

995
00:40:24,505 --> 00:40:25,256
-Ha, ha, ha, ha.

996
00:40:29,010 --> 00:40:30,261
-Get the hell outta here.

997
00:40:30,261 --> 00:40:33,598
I told you I wanted your
daughter to take care of me.

998
00:40:33,598 --> 00:40:37,143
-It'll be a cold day
in hell before I ever

999
00:40:37,143 --> 00:40:40,271
serve you again you
fuck disgusting pig.

1000
00:40:40,271 --> 00:40:41,064
-Shh.

1001
00:40:41,064 --> 00:40:41,814
-What'd she say?

1002
00:40:44,525 --> 00:40:45,735
-[speaking spanish]

1003
00:40:45,735 --> 00:40:46,861
-She didn't mean that.

1004
00:40:50,657 --> 00:40:54,952
-I'm going to try to say
this as politely as possible.

1005
00:40:54,952 --> 00:40:56,663
Why don't you just get
the hell out of here,

1006
00:40:56,663 --> 00:40:58,873
and take those
two pigs with you.

1007
00:40:58,873 --> 00:41:00,291
-All right, that's it.

1008
00:41:08,257 --> 00:41:11,719

1009
00:41:11,719 --> 00:41:13,721

[car driving off]

1014
00:41:36,619 --> 00:41:37,370
-Is he dead?

1015
00:41:41,916 --> 00:41:45,420
-He's a goner all right.

1016
00:41:45,420 --> 00:41:48,172
-Son-of-a-bitch!

1017
00:41:48,172 --> 00:41:49,090
What happened?

1018
00:41:49,090 --> 00:41:50,508
Which way did they go?

1019
00:41:50,508 --> 00:41:51,801
-They all beat it.

1020
00:41:51,801 --> 00:41:52,593
-That way.

1021
00:41:52,593 --> 00:41:55,263
That way!

1022
00:41:55,263 --> 00:41:56,264
-Let's get outta here.

1023
00:41:56,264 --> 00:41:56,973
Come on.

1024
00:42:01,978 --> 00:42:02,937
Come on, let's get outta here.

1025
00:42:15,324 --> 00:42:18,786
-We're standing in front of
Mambo Cafe, a Puerto Rican

1026
00:42:18,786 --> 00:42:22,123
in Spanish Harlem where the
on-going feud between two

1027
00:42:22,123 --> 00:42:25,960
local mafia families has just
claimed victim number five.

1028
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:28,921
And with us we have Frank
Benitez, the restaurant's owner

1029
00:42:28,921 --> 00:42:32,341
who was at the scene
when the hit occurred.

1030
00:42:32,341 --> 00:42:36,012
Mr. Benitez, could you
describe what you saw?

1031
00:42:36,012 --> 00:42:38,514
-Well, like I told
the police already,

1032
00:42:38,514 --> 00:42:41,476
it all happened so fast.

1033
00:42:41,476 --> 00:42:45,813
Uh, I heard a shot-- a bang,
bang-- and I turned around

1034
00:42:45,813 --> 00:42:48,733
real fast, and I
saw this guy laying

1035
00:42:48,733 --> 00:42:52,987
on the floor of my
restaurant, the Mambo Cafe.

1036
00:42:52,987 --> 00:42:54,655
Take the four, or
the five, or the six.

1037
00:42:54,655 --> 00:42:56,115
We're on the corner of
108th and 2nd Avenue.

1038
00:42:56,115 --> 00:42:57,492
We're open for lunch.

1039
00:42:57,492 --> 00:42:59,660
-So what you're saying is that
although you had just finished

1040
00:42:59,660 --> 00:43:01,829
serving the deceased when
the drive-by occurred,

1041
00:43:01,829 --> 00:43:04,791
you were unable to get a good
look at either the assailant

1042
00:43:04,791 --> 00:43:06,834
or their vehicle as
it fled the scene?

1043
00:43:06,834 --> 00:43:08,878
-Yes, uh, these guys were fast.

1044
00:43:08,878 --> 00:43:11,672
All I heard was the
tires screeching

1045
00:43:11,672 --> 00:43:13,883
as they fled the Mambo Cafe.

1046
00:43:13,883 --> 00:43:15,384
Uh, take the 4, or
the 5, or the 6.

1047
00:43:15,384 --> 00:43:19,639
Our phone number is
555-1445, and all kids

1048
00:43:19,639 --> 00:43:21,599
under two months
old eat for free.

1049
00:43:28,105 --> 00:43:30,191
-I don't understand it.

1050
00:43:30,191 --> 00:43:31,192
A guy got hit at what?

1051
00:43:31,192 --> 00:43:32,026
5:00?

1052
00:43:32,026 --> 00:43:33,027
-6:00.

1053
00:43:33,027 --> 00:43:34,111
-OK, 6:00.

1054
00:43:34,111 --> 00:43:38,366
And then you got the
news at 7:00 and 11:00.

1055
00:43:38,366 --> 00:43:41,744
So don't you think that by now
some of the people coming home

1056
00:43:41,744 --> 00:43:43,371
from work would be
a little curious

1057
00:43:43,371 --> 00:43:44,872
about where that guy got hit?

1058
00:43:44,872 --> 00:43:47,291
-Maybe we ought to give
people more credit.

1059
00:43:47,291 --> 00:43:49,168
-Man!

1060
00:43:49,168 --> 00:43:51,629
I'm jinxed is what it is.

1061
00:43:51,629 --> 00:43:53,381
That's it, you know.

1062
00:43:53,381 --> 00:43:56,259
I have no more ideas.

1063
00:43:56,259 --> 00:43:57,260
Go ahead.

1064
00:43:57,260 --> 00:43:58,928
Call your brother.

1065
00:43:58,928 --> 00:44:01,013
Tell him he was right all along.

1066
00:44:01,013 --> 00:44:03,140
Tell them what a big
disappointment I turned out

1067
00:44:03,140 --> 00:44:05,560
to be, and that if
he'll put us up I,

1068
00:44:05,560 --> 00:44:07,770
I promise to keep my
head down whenever

1069
00:44:07,770 --> 00:44:09,897
he walks into the room.

1070
00:44:09,897 --> 00:44:11,065
-I don't understand
why you always

1071
00:44:11,065 --> 00:44:14,151
gotta be comparing
yourself to my brother for.

1072
00:44:14,151 --> 00:44:17,029
At least you tried
to do something.

1073
00:44:17,029 --> 00:44:18,406
You worked your way
up from a dishwasher,

1074
00:44:18,406 --> 00:44:21,409
and you opened up
your own restaurant.

1075
00:44:21,409 --> 00:44:24,370
And you put your daughter
through three years of college.

1076
00:44:24,370 --> 00:44:26,497
How many people do we know
over there who can say that?

1077
00:44:29,458 --> 00:44:31,377
-You really mean that?

1078
00:44:31,377 --> 00:44:32,461
-I said it didn't I?

1079
00:44:36,424 --> 00:44:40,845
[knocking]

1080
00:44:40,845 --> 00:44:43,264
-Gilberto, I don't
have the money.

1081
00:44:43,264 --> 00:44:44,265
OK?

1082
00:44:44,265 --> 00:44:45,766
I'm working on
getting you the money.

1083
00:44:45,766 --> 00:44:46,601
OK?
-No.

1084
00:44:46,601 --> 00:44:47,393
Listen, Frank.

1085
00:44:47,393 --> 00:44:48,519
I heard about what happened.

1086
00:44:48,519 --> 00:44:50,187
And with all the news
coverage and everything.

1087
00:44:50,187 --> 00:44:52,356
And I figured you're
going to be needing

1088
00:44:52,356 --> 00:44:54,775
a lot more groceries
from now on.

1089
00:44:54,775 --> 00:44:57,111
Anything you need--
and I mean anything--

1090
00:44:57,111 --> 00:44:58,863
you just come to my store.

1091
00:44:58,863 --> 00:44:59,989
Is that OK?

1092
00:44:59,989 --> 00:45:01,407
-Well, thanks.

1093
00:45:01,407 --> 00:45:04,785
But you know, with my luck, news
coverage or no news coverage,

1094
00:45:04,785 --> 00:45:06,454
everything's the
same around here.

1095
00:45:06,454 --> 00:45:08,664
Look, I think somebody
put the brujeria on me.

1096
00:45:08,664 --> 00:45:10,333
I'm going to go
back to Puerto Rico.

1097
00:45:10,333 --> 00:45:11,918
I'll try to send you the
money from over there.

1098
00:45:11,918 --> 00:45:12,710
OK?

1099
00:45:12,710 --> 00:45:13,753
-What are you talking about?

1100
00:45:13,753 --> 00:45:14,462
Look.

1101
00:45:22,845 --> 00:45:24,305
-We made it!

1102
00:45:24,305 --> 00:45:25,806
We made it!

1103
00:45:25,806 --> 00:45:27,266
Carmen, we made it!

1104
00:45:27,266 --> 00:45:28,726
We did it!

1105
00:45:28,726 --> 00:45:29,685
Oh, thank God.

1106
00:45:29,685 --> 00:45:30,645
We did it!

1107
00:45:30,645 --> 00:45:31,646
-What did you do?

1108
00:45:31,646 --> 00:45:33,105
-We've got customers!

1109
00:45:33,105 --> 00:45:35,066
We've got customers!

1110
00:45:35,066 --> 00:45:36,067
Go check the window.

1111
00:45:36,067 --> 00:45:37,276
Just watch, over there.

1112
00:45:42,323 --> 00:45:44,325
CARMEN: Oh my god!

1113
00:45:44,325 --> 00:45:46,327
They're lined up
and down the street!

1114
00:45:46,327 --> 00:45:47,828
-Tell Ricky and Nydia
to come down here.

1115
00:45:47,828 --> 00:45:48,788
We're going to need some help.

1116
00:45:48,788 --> 00:45:51,290
Ah!

1117
00:45:51,290 --> 00:45:52,291
CARMEN: Ricky, hurry up.

1118
00:45:52,291 --> 00:45:54,293
Go look, there's customers!

1119
00:45:54,293 --> 00:45:55,753
-We did it!

1120
00:45:55,753 --> 00:45:57,254
We got customers!

1121
00:45:57,254 --> 00:45:58,673
-[squeal]

1122
00:45:58,673 --> 00:45:59,757
-Nydia.

1123
00:45:59,757 --> 00:46:00,800
Nydia, go upstairs,
get your clothes on

1124
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:03,219
and bring your
papa's pants down.

1125
00:46:03,219 --> 00:46:05,179
-People are getting
inpatient out there.

1126
00:46:05,179 --> 00:46:06,555
-Well, just let 'em in.

1127
00:46:06,555 --> 00:46:07,473
-What are you crazy!

1128
00:46:07,473 --> 00:46:08,265
We're not ready.

1129
00:46:08,265 --> 00:46:09,600
-That's OK.

1130
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:11,560
I just want to see people in
the restaurant for a change.

1131
00:46:11,560 --> 00:46:12,853
Come on in!

1132
00:46:12,853 --> 00:46:14,689
-I want the table where he
was sitting when he got hit.

1133
00:46:14,689 --> 00:46:15,398
-He was right here!

1134
00:46:20,695 --> 00:46:25,199
[talking excitedly]

1135
00:46:25,199 --> 00:46:26,200
-He was right here!

1136
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:26,993
He was over here!

1137
00:46:26,993 --> 00:46:29,203
Right here.

1138
00:46:29,203 --> 00:46:31,163
He was right here!

1139
00:46:31,163 --> 00:46:32,164
And right here too.

1140
00:46:32,164 --> 00:46:33,165
He stumbled.

1141
00:46:33,165 --> 00:46:33,958
He got shot over here.

1142
00:46:33,958 --> 00:46:34,750
He went here.

1143
00:46:34,750 --> 00:46:35,710
He went here.

1144
00:46:35,710 --> 00:46:39,588
He was a big, fat,
disgusting guy.

1145
00:46:39,588 --> 00:46:41,007
-Give me what he had
before they did him in.

1146
00:46:46,679 --> 00:46:47,722
-I'm telling you everybody!

1147
00:46:47,722 --> 00:46:51,559
He was a big, fat,
disgusting criminal.

1148
00:46:51,559 --> 00:46:53,686
He was all over this restaurant.

1149
00:46:53,686 --> 00:46:56,480
Give me my pants.

1150
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:57,773
-Chris.

1151
00:46:57,773 --> 00:47:00,026
Chris I have some
very good news.

1152
00:47:00,026 --> 00:47:02,069
Mother's doing
much, much better.

1153
00:47:02,069 --> 00:47:03,863
And I think I'll
be able to leave

1154
00:47:03,863 --> 00:47:05,823
Argentina in a couple of days.

1155
00:47:05,823 --> 00:47:06,615
Isn't that just wonderful?

1156
00:47:09,535 --> 00:47:10,828
The doctor is assigning
a nurse to stay

1157
00:47:10,828 --> 00:47:14,248
with my mother for
the next few weeks.

1158
00:47:14,248 --> 00:47:16,000
He feels the chances
of her having

1159
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,210
another stroke are minimal.

1160
00:47:18,210 --> 00:47:22,882
Even mother feels there
is no need for me to stay.

1161
00:47:22,882 --> 00:47:27,344
Yeah, she really
is just wonderful.

1162
00:47:27,344 --> 00:47:31,307
[giggles]

1163
00:47:31,307 --> 00:47:35,144
Ma, since the restaurant
is doing much better now,

1164
00:47:35,144 --> 00:47:37,938
can I have some money to
get my hair touched up?

1165
00:47:37,938 --> 00:47:41,275
I mean, look at this.

1166
00:47:41,275 --> 00:47:42,485
-Nydia, you have
such beautiful hair.

1167
00:47:42,485 --> 00:47:44,153
Why don't you just get one
of those short haircuts

1168
00:47:44,153 --> 00:47:45,780
until it grows back out.

1169
00:47:45,780 --> 00:47:48,616
-'Cause I like it this way.

1170
00:47:48,616 --> 00:47:50,493
So do we have any
extra money or not?

1171
00:47:50,493 --> 00:47:51,786
-Nydia?

1172
00:47:51,786 --> 00:47:54,121
-Hm?

1173
00:47:54,121 --> 00:47:56,457
-Is there anything
you want to tell me?

1174
00:47:56,457 --> 00:47:57,917
-Like what?

1175
00:47:57,917 --> 00:47:59,919
-I don't know like do I
have any terrible diseases

1176
00:47:59,919 --> 00:48:01,670
I don't know anything about?

1177
00:48:01,670 --> 00:48:03,130
-What are you talking about?

1178
00:48:03,130 --> 00:48:06,467
-I'm talking about me having
relapses, and needing nurses,

1179
00:48:06,467 --> 00:48:08,803
and you having to
leave Argentina.

1180
00:48:08,803 --> 00:48:10,304
When the hell were you
ever in Argentina, Nydia?

1181
00:48:13,307 --> 00:48:15,309
-I can't believe this.

1182
00:48:15,309 --> 00:48:17,686
You've been spying on me?

1183
00:48:17,686 --> 00:48:19,814
-Hey, don't try and
turn this thing around.

1184
00:48:19,814 --> 00:48:22,399
OK? 'Cause I was innocently
walking to my room

1185
00:48:22,399 --> 00:48:23,943
when I heard some
person I didn't

1186
00:48:23,943 --> 00:48:25,861
know talking on your telephone.

1187
00:48:25,861 --> 00:48:29,448
Nydia, I'm going
to say this once.

1188
00:48:29,448 --> 00:48:32,368
You better start telling me
what's going on, because I

1189
00:48:32,368 --> 00:48:34,328
swear, money or no
money, you're not

1190
00:48:34,328 --> 00:48:36,413
going back to that
Boston University.

1191
00:48:36,413 --> 00:48:38,082
-You want me to tell
you what's going on?

1192
00:48:38,082 --> 00:48:38,916
-Yeah!

1193
00:48:38,916 --> 00:48:41,585
-Fine, I'll tell you all right.

1194
00:48:41,585 --> 00:48:42,336
I'll tell you.

1195
00:48:45,881 --> 00:48:48,926
I met Chris at a
party at Harvard.

1196
00:48:48,926 --> 00:48:52,680
His father is one of the
top surgeons in Boston.

1197
00:48:52,680 --> 00:48:54,348
His uncle is also a
doctor who teaches

1198
00:48:54,348 --> 00:48:55,558
at Harvard Medical School.

1199
00:48:58,519 --> 00:49:05,234
First, I told one little lie
to cover my stupid accent.

1200
00:49:05,234 --> 00:49:09,071
And then I had to tell another
lie to cover the first one.

1201
00:49:09,071 --> 00:49:13,576
And anyway, I'm sure you
know how the rest goes.

1202
00:49:13,576 --> 00:49:18,038
By the end of two drinks,
he thinks I'm wealthy.

1203
00:49:18,038 --> 00:49:19,707
And then when Dad said I
couldn't go to the Cape

1204
00:49:19,707 --> 00:49:22,710
to meet his parents, I had to
make up this thing about having

1205
00:49:22,710 --> 00:49:25,045
to go home because
you were sick and now

1206
00:49:25,045 --> 00:49:27,923
we're staying in Argentina.

1207
00:49:27,923 --> 00:49:32,386
Mom, you have no idea
what it's like out there.

1208
00:49:32,386 --> 00:49:34,722
You don't know how many
times I've met guys up there,

1209
00:49:34,722 --> 00:49:37,016
and when I tell them
I'm Puerto Rican,

1210
00:49:37,016 --> 00:49:39,935
sooner or later they get
around to asking if I grew up

1211
00:49:39,935 --> 00:49:42,938
on welfare, and if I have
any relatives in jail.

1212
00:49:42,938 --> 00:49:45,941
And I'm not just talking
about the students, either.

1213
00:49:45,941 --> 00:49:47,526
Even the professors
treat you like

1214
00:49:47,526 --> 00:49:48,986
you're from Mars or something.

1215
00:49:48,986 --> 00:49:51,030
I just get a little bored with
being on display all the time,

1216
00:49:51,030 --> 00:49:52,072
OK?

1217
00:49:52,072 --> 00:49:53,240
-I never realized
going to go college

1218
00:49:53,240 --> 00:49:54,450
could be so traumatic, Nydia.

1219
00:49:54,450 --> 00:49:55,910
Maybe I ought to
take your tuition

1220
00:49:55,910 --> 00:49:57,953
and send you to a
psychiatrist instead.

1221
00:49:57,953 --> 00:49:58,913
-See?

1222
00:49:58,913 --> 00:50:01,582
That's just what
I'm talking about.

1223
00:50:01,582 --> 00:50:04,418
There's just no way you're
going to understand, mom.

1224
00:50:04,418 --> 00:50:06,837
-I heard you say that
I was over my stroke,

1225
00:50:06,837 --> 00:50:09,298
and that you were
leaving Argentina.

1226
00:50:09,298 --> 00:50:12,051
Does that mean you're
going to the Cape?

1227
00:50:12,051 --> 00:50:14,595
-Well, it seems the restaurant
is doing much better now.

1228
00:50:14,595 --> 00:50:17,348
-Hey, I thought you were
studying business over there.

1229
00:50:17,348 --> 00:50:20,309
This place has been practically
empty for almost a year.

1230
00:50:20,309 --> 00:50:21,143
What do you think?

1231
00:50:21,143 --> 00:50:22,978
Our problems are suddenly over?

1232
00:50:22,978 --> 00:50:25,439
We can't afford
to hire somebody!

1233
00:50:25,439 --> 00:50:28,400
We need you here to at least
help us wait on the tables!

1234
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:30,194
[spanish] Come here.

1235
00:50:30,194 --> 00:50:32,947
Come here.

1236
00:50:32,947 --> 00:50:36,700
I want to show you
something really special.

1237
00:50:36,700 --> 00:50:38,035
Look at this.

1238
00:50:38,035 --> 00:50:40,537
Your father went out yesterday
and he put this on credit,

1239
00:50:40,537 --> 00:50:42,248
just so you could have
something nice to wear when

1240
00:50:42,248 --> 00:50:44,375
you're working in
the restaurant.

1241
00:50:44,375 --> 00:50:45,876
And I know it's not
exactly something

1242
00:50:45,876 --> 00:50:47,002
you would pick out for yourself.

1243
00:50:47,002 --> 00:50:48,796
But he's jumping up and
down because he thinks

1244
00:50:48,796 --> 00:50:50,130
you're spending the
holidays with us.

1245
00:50:50,130 --> 00:50:53,384
And as much as he sacrificed
to put you through college,

1246
00:50:53,384 --> 00:50:56,303
the least you can do is call
this rich boyfriend of yours

1247
00:50:56,303 --> 00:50:58,806
and tell him I had
another relapse.

1248
00:50:58,806 --> 00:51:01,475
And another thing, I may just be
some jibaro that went straight

1249
00:51:01,475 --> 00:51:03,477
from Puerto Rico
to Spanish Harlem,

1250
00:51:03,477 --> 00:51:06,146
but it seems to me that if this
guy was worth anything more

1251
00:51:06,146 --> 00:51:08,941
than just money, he would
appreciate you a million

1252
00:51:08,941 --> 00:51:11,151
times more for
who you really are

1253
00:51:11,151 --> 00:51:13,320
and what it is you're
trying to accomplish.

1254
00:51:13,320 --> 00:51:16,323
Instead of going around trying
to build a relationship based

1255
00:51:16,323 --> 00:51:19,201
on one of the biggest
whoppers I ever heard, Nydia.

1256
00:51:19,201 --> 00:51:20,953
-Chris is not like that, Mom.

1257
00:51:20,953 --> 00:51:23,664
Any day now I'm going
to tell him the truth.

1258
00:51:23,664 --> 00:51:25,207
I just need a little
more time so--

1259
00:51:25,207 --> 00:51:26,500
so he can get to know me better.

1260
00:51:26,500 --> 00:51:27,251
That's all!

1261
00:51:57,823 --> 00:51:58,615
-Boo.

1262
00:51:58,615 --> 00:52:02,077
-Oh, Manny.

1263
00:52:02,077 --> 00:52:05,080
-You know, you should let
Ricky help you with this stuff.

1264
00:52:05,080 --> 00:52:07,333
-He's busy helping
Frank at the restaurant.

1265
00:52:07,333 --> 00:52:08,751
We're doing a little
better now, you know.

1266
00:52:08,751 --> 00:52:09,752
-I heard.

1267
00:52:09,752 --> 00:52:12,129
-So Manny, what's
a matter for you?

1268
00:52:12,129 --> 00:52:14,798
All of a sudden you're too
good to come to the restaurant

1269
00:52:14,798 --> 00:52:15,591
anymore?

1270
00:52:15,591 --> 00:52:16,759
-Not at all.

1271
00:52:16,759 --> 00:52:17,551
You know how it is.

1272
00:52:17,551 --> 00:52:18,969
Sometimes you get busy.

1273
00:52:18,969 --> 00:52:20,387
And before you know
it, you don't even

1274
00:52:20,387 --> 00:52:22,056
have time to visit
your favorite people.

1275
00:52:22,056 --> 00:52:23,932
-So you should come anyway.

1276
00:52:23,932 --> 00:52:25,142
And don't worry about Nydia.

1277
00:52:25,142 --> 00:52:26,769
You know, she's just a
little confused right now.

1278
00:52:26,769 --> 00:52:27,603
-I don't know.

1279
00:52:27,603 --> 00:52:29,188
She seemed pretty clear to me.

1280
00:52:29,188 --> 00:52:29,980
-You talk to her?

1281
00:52:29,980 --> 00:52:30,773
-Yeah, yeah.

1282
00:52:30,773 --> 00:52:32,316
We talked on the phone.

1283
00:52:32,316 --> 00:52:34,485
Mostly I just listened.

1284
00:52:34,485 --> 00:52:35,402
-She told you about Harvard.

1285
00:52:35,402 --> 00:52:37,071
-Yeah.

1286
00:52:37,071 --> 00:52:39,907
And, uh, who's gonna
compete with that, right?

1287
00:52:39,907 --> 00:52:40,991
-Hmm.

1288
00:52:40,991 --> 00:52:42,409
-Listen, I-- I gotta
go finish something up.

1289
00:52:42,409 --> 00:52:43,243
Are you gonna be OK?

1290
00:52:43,243 --> 00:52:46,413
-Oh my god, I don't believe it.

1291
00:52:46,413 --> 00:52:50,167
You know, this is exactly
what I've been looking for.

1292
00:52:50,167 --> 00:52:51,752
But how am I gonna get
this big thing back

1293
00:52:51,752 --> 00:52:54,046
to the restaurant with all
these bags and everything?

1294
00:52:57,758 --> 00:53:02,596
[speaking spanish]

1295
00:53:02,596 --> 00:53:03,430
-Ma,where you been?

1296
00:53:03,430 --> 00:53:04,640
You see that crowd out there?

1297
00:53:04,640 --> 00:53:06,225
-Manny had to help me
pick up some things.

1298
00:53:06,225 --> 00:53:07,476
Put them over there,
would you, Manny.

1299
00:53:07,476 --> 00:53:08,560
Nydia!

1300
00:53:08,560 --> 00:53:10,312
Nydia!

1301
00:53:10,312 --> 00:53:11,230
-Hey Manny, come here.

1302
00:53:11,230 --> 00:53:11,939
Check this out.

1303
00:53:14,858 --> 00:53:15,901
So what do you think?

1304
00:53:18,529 --> 00:53:20,989
-I don't think the feet
are supposed to have toes.

1305
00:53:20,989 --> 00:53:22,616
-Oh yeah.

1306
00:53:22,616 --> 00:53:23,784
Yeah, maybe you're right.

1307
00:53:23,784 --> 00:53:24,785
-Hey, hey, Manny!

1308
00:53:24,785 --> 00:53:25,619
-Hey, Frank.

1309
00:53:25,619 --> 00:53:27,871
-Pretty exciting, huh?

1310
00:53:27,871 --> 00:53:30,624
Look at the size of that guy.

1311
00:53:30,624 --> 00:53:32,084
Yesterday we had
three tourists that

1312
00:53:32,084 --> 00:53:33,710
came here and laid
down to take pictures.

1313
00:53:33,710 --> 00:53:36,130
There was still
room for one more!

1314
00:53:36,130 --> 00:53:38,298
I think whoever did this
was a really bad shot

1315
00:53:38,298 --> 00:53:40,134
because that bullet
richocheted all over the place

1316
00:53:40,134 --> 00:53:41,135
before it got him.

1317
00:53:41,135 --> 00:53:42,636
Look, there's a bullet
hole over there.

1318
00:53:42,636 --> 00:53:43,762
There's a bullet
hole right there.

1319
00:53:43,762 --> 00:53:44,972
One over there.

1320
00:53:44,972 --> 00:53:46,181
And there's one right
above the door over there.

1321
00:53:46,181 --> 00:53:47,808
-Carmen, por favor,
I really have to go.

1322
00:53:47,808 --> 00:53:48,976
-No, no, no no, no.

1323
00:53:48,976 --> 00:53:50,519
Don't give me any of this
I have to go stuff, OK?

1324
00:53:50,519 --> 00:53:51,520
[speaking spanish] Frank.

1325
00:53:51,520 --> 00:53:53,814
He looks like he
hasn't eaten in months.

1326
00:53:53,814 --> 00:53:56,024
-Hey, don't look at me, because
you know when a Puerto Rican

1327
00:53:56,024 --> 00:53:59,570
woman decides to feed you, just
open up your mouth and chew!

1328
00:53:59,570 --> 00:54:00,988
-Eat.

1329
00:54:00,988 --> 00:54:02,322
-Welp, since you
put it that way.

1330
00:54:05,659 --> 00:54:06,785
NYDIA: I can't wear this dress.

1331
00:54:06,785 --> 00:54:08,162
Look at this.

1332
00:54:08,162 --> 00:54:09,538
My boobs are falling out!

1333
00:54:09,538 --> 00:54:11,665
FRANK: You look beautiful!

1334
00:54:11,665 --> 00:54:16,545
[music playing]

1335
00:54:36,356 --> 00:54:38,358
-[speaking spanish].

1336
00:54:38,358 --> 00:54:39,860
I knew it.

1337
00:54:39,860 --> 00:54:42,779
Why can't anybody tell
me when we have company?

1338
00:54:42,779 --> 00:54:46,825
-Because you're the only one
who considers Manny company.

1339
00:54:46,825 --> 00:54:49,912
-Look, I-- I was, uh--
I was leaving anyway.

1340
00:54:49,912 --> 00:54:50,746
-Manny, I'm sorry.

1341
00:54:50,746 --> 00:54:51,538
I didn't mean that.
-No.

1342
00:54:51,538 --> 00:54:52,748
Oh, please.

1343
00:54:52,748 --> 00:54:54,333
-It's just that you always
catch me by surprise.

1344
00:54:54,333 --> 00:54:55,918
-Yeah, well, I,
uh-- I guess I could

1345
00:54:55,918 --> 00:54:57,503
say the same thing about you.

1346
00:54:57,503 --> 00:54:58,462
-Uh, Manny.

1347
00:54:58,462 --> 00:55:00,005
I know this is kind
of last minute,

1348
00:55:00,005 --> 00:55:01,590
but we're gonna open soon.

1349
00:55:01,590 --> 00:55:04,843
Could you stay and help us out
just before we get started?

1350
00:55:04,843 --> 00:55:06,220
-What are you doing?

1351
00:55:06,220 --> 00:55:08,388
We can manage this.

1352
00:55:08,388 --> 00:55:11,850
Besides, I'm sure Manny
has a lot of things to do.

1353
00:55:11,850 --> 00:55:13,185
Don't you have something to do?

1354
00:55:15,854 --> 00:55:17,231
-No.

1355
00:55:17,231 --> 00:55:20,442
As a matter of fact I don't.

1356
00:55:20,442 --> 00:55:21,318
-(SARCASTIC) Fine.

1357
00:55:21,318 --> 00:55:22,402
Fine.

1358
00:55:22,402 --> 00:55:24,238
Is this how you want
to spend your evening.

1359
00:55:24,238 --> 00:55:24,947
OK.

1360
00:55:28,325 --> 00:55:29,618
You take tables
one through five,

1361
00:55:29,618 --> 00:55:31,870
and I'll take six through ten.

1362
00:55:31,870 --> 00:55:33,914
-And first of all, in case
you've already forgotten,

1363
00:55:33,914 --> 00:55:35,165
I've done this plenty
of times before,

1364
00:55:35,165 --> 00:55:36,667
so I don't need you
telling me what to do.

1365
00:55:36,667 --> 00:55:41,213
And secondly, I'm not
doing this for you.

1366
00:55:41,213 --> 00:55:43,757
I'm doing it for your parents.

1367
00:55:43,757 --> 00:55:48,845
-Well, now that that's settled,
I'll go check on the beans.

1368
00:55:48,845 --> 00:55:50,806
-Can I open up now?

1369
00:55:50,806 --> 00:55:51,598
-Go ahead.

1370
00:55:51,598 --> 00:55:52,516
Let them in.

1371
00:55:57,729 --> 00:55:58,522
-Bienvenidos.

1372
00:55:58,522 --> 00:56:00,274
Welcome.

1373
00:56:00,274 --> 00:56:02,734
Hello, and welcome
to the Mambo Cafe.

1374
00:56:02,734 --> 00:56:04,945
Today's special is
Nydia's chuletas.

1375
00:56:04,945 --> 00:56:06,280
-Yeah, yeah, yeah, whatever.

1376
00:56:06,280 --> 00:56:08,907
You know that we've been outside
in the cold for 20 minutes?

1377
00:56:08,907 --> 00:56:10,784
When the hell are
we gonna sit down?

1378
00:56:10,784 --> 00:56:12,703
-Uh, Manny.

1379
00:56:12,703 --> 00:56:13,954
-Right away.

1380
00:56:13,954 --> 00:56:16,790
Nydia herself is going
to take care of you.

1381
00:56:16,790 --> 00:56:17,583
-Come with me, please.

1382
00:56:17,583 --> 00:56:18,959
-Hey.

1383
00:56:18,959 --> 00:56:22,212
And don't go putting us at a
table near the kitchen either!

1384
00:56:22,212 --> 00:56:23,297
-Hola.

1385
00:56:23,297 --> 00:56:30,804
We would like Una, mesa
for tres, por favor.

1386
00:56:30,804 --> 00:56:32,055
-Ah, si. [speaking spanish].

1387
00:56:32,055 --> 00:56:34,057
Why don't you come with me, eh?

1388
00:56:34,057 --> 00:56:37,227
I have, how do you say,
the perfect table for two.

1389
00:56:37,227 --> 00:56:38,186
-Oh!

1390
00:56:38,186 --> 00:56:38,937
-All right.

1391
00:56:43,525 --> 00:56:45,652
-This is Nydia.

1392
00:56:45,652 --> 00:56:49,531
She will, how do you say, will
be on honored to serve you.

1393
00:56:49,531 --> 00:56:50,616
-Oh.

1394
00:56:50,616 --> 00:56:51,450
Gracias.

1395
00:56:51,450 --> 00:56:52,409
-Thank-- thank you very much.

1396
00:56:52,409 --> 00:56:53,160
Thanks.

1397
00:56:56,788 --> 00:57:00,584
-Mommy, why is she wearing
that thing on her head?

1398
00:57:00,584 --> 00:57:05,339
-Honey, what did mommy
tell you about foreigners?

1399
00:57:05,339 --> 00:57:07,090
-That we should
stay away from them

1400
00:57:07,090 --> 00:57:08,967
because they have diseases?

1401
00:57:08,967 --> 00:57:10,177
-No.

1402
00:57:10,177 --> 00:57:11,678
-The other thing.

1403
00:57:11,678 --> 00:57:14,723
Sometimes they wear
colorful costumes

1404
00:57:14,723 --> 00:57:17,517
because they pray to gods
that are different than ours.

1405
00:57:20,437 --> 00:57:22,564
-Could you excuse me a second.

1406
00:57:22,564 --> 00:57:23,565
-Oh.

1407
00:57:23,565 --> 00:57:24,858
You speak English!

1408
00:57:29,196 --> 00:57:30,155
-[speaking spanish].

1409
00:57:30,155 --> 00:57:32,032
What the hell are you doing?

1410
00:57:32,032 --> 00:57:33,700
Is this why you stay?

1411
00:57:33,700 --> 00:57:34,785
To give me a hard time.

1412
00:57:34,785 --> 00:57:36,536
-Look, I'm sorry, OK?

1413
00:57:36,536 --> 00:57:38,705
It's just that you're
always so serious.

1414
00:57:38,705 --> 00:57:41,667
I-- I just thought it
might make you laugh.

1415
00:57:41,667 --> 00:57:44,378
-Make me laugh?

1416
00:57:44,378 --> 00:57:47,214
Look at the way I'm dressed.

1417
00:57:47,214 --> 00:57:50,967
I wear business suits and
carry a brief case in Boston.

1418
00:57:50,967 --> 00:57:52,844
And those people
over there think

1419
00:57:52,844 --> 00:57:54,721
that I'm dressed like
this to pray to gods.

1420
00:57:59,726 --> 00:58:00,769
What's the hell is so funny?

1421
00:58:03,855 --> 00:58:04,564
-Nothing.

1422
00:58:07,526 --> 00:58:08,735
-Just forget about it, OK?

1423
00:58:14,241 --> 00:58:16,910
Sorry, we had a
slight emergency.

1424
00:58:16,910 --> 00:58:18,787
Uh, have you had a chance
to look at the menu?

1425
00:58:18,787 --> 00:58:19,579
-Ah, yes.

1426
00:58:19,579 --> 00:58:20,747
Yes.

1427
00:58:20,747 --> 00:58:24,251
Can you tell me, what
is Fat Tony's last meal?

1428
00:58:24,251 --> 00:58:26,753
-Isn't my wife incredible?

1429
00:58:26,753 --> 00:58:29,506
One day she's in this
country and already she

1430
00:58:29,506 --> 00:58:31,591
speaks perfect English.

1431
00:58:31,591 --> 00:58:33,927
-Isn't there something
you should be doing?

1432
00:58:33,927 --> 00:58:35,137
-I got-- of course.

1433
00:58:35,137 --> 00:58:36,263
How stupid of me.

1434
00:58:36,263 --> 00:58:38,598
This is our favorite song.

1435
00:58:38,598 --> 00:58:41,810
We must dance.

1436
00:58:41,810 --> 00:58:42,561
-They're gonna dance!

1437
00:58:47,607 --> 00:58:53,029
[music playing]

1438
00:59:34,821 --> 00:59:35,864
-See?

1439
00:59:35,864 --> 00:59:38,325
This is exactly why
I love these Latins.

1440
00:59:41,912 --> 00:59:44,164
The world could be
falling down around them,

1441
00:59:44,164 --> 00:59:46,583
and all they want
to do is dance!

1442
00:59:58,053 --> 01:00:04,267
[bells ringing]

1443
01:00:04,267 --> 01:00:05,477
MAN ON STREET: I'm
thinking of goin'

1444
01:00:05,477 --> 01:00:06,853
somewhere-- Canada or something.

1445
01:00:06,853 --> 01:00:08,438
SECOND MAN ON STREET: I
wan going down to Miami.

1446
01:00:08,438 --> 01:00:10,440
MAN ON STREET: Oh really?

1447
01:00:10,440 --> 01:00:12,400
It's hot over there.

1448
01:00:12,400 --> 01:00:13,819
You know, so I don't know.

1449
01:00:16,404 --> 01:00:18,198
-Listen, Joey.

1450
01:00:18,198 --> 01:00:20,033
I just want to
thank you for taking

1451
01:00:20,033 --> 01:00:22,410
care of that Fat Tony problem.

1452
01:00:22,410 --> 01:00:26,248
I know me and him were--
we grew up together.

1453
01:00:26,248 --> 01:00:30,126
He was nine years old and we
shook down our first tourists

1454
01:00:30,126 --> 01:00:32,796
right over there on 5th Street.

1455
01:00:32,796 --> 01:00:37,217
And that son of a bitch--
that greedy, ungrateful,

1456
01:00:37,217 --> 01:00:39,052
double-crossing
son of a bitch, he

1457
01:00:39,052 --> 01:00:40,345
had the nerve to steal from me.

1458
01:00:43,598 --> 01:00:48,061
Anyway, I want to thank you.

1459
01:00:48,061 --> 01:00:51,064
I owe you.

1460
01:00:51,064 --> 01:00:53,567
Now, thank you.

1461
01:00:53,567 --> 01:00:56,486
-[italian]

1462
01:01:12,002 --> 01:01:13,837
Remember that Fat Tony thing?

1463
01:01:13,837 --> 01:01:15,714
-Yeah, what about it, Joey?

1464
01:01:15,714 --> 01:01:17,924
-I always thought Angelo
took care of him-- you know,

1465
01:01:17,924 --> 01:01:21,177
Fat Tony being his
cousin and whatnot.

1466
01:01:21,177 --> 01:01:23,847
-Yeah, we too.

1467
01:01:23,847 --> 01:01:26,099
-So how come just
now Angelo comes up

1468
01:01:26,099 --> 01:01:29,185
and thanks me for
taking care of him?

1469
01:01:29,185 --> 01:01:31,605
-I don't know, Joey.

1470
01:01:31,605 --> 01:01:33,940
-I want you two to see what
you can find out about him.

1471
01:01:33,940 --> 01:01:36,568
And don't say squat
to nobody, you hear?

1472
01:01:36,568 --> 01:01:37,360
-Yeah.

1473
01:01:37,360 --> 01:01:38,445
We got it covered, Joey.

1474
01:01:38,445 --> 01:01:40,071
Don't worry about it.

1475
01:01:40,071 --> 01:01:40,780
-[speaking spanish].

1476
01:01:49,998 --> 01:01:51,833
-And you said that
you, uh, you read

1477
01:01:51,833 --> 01:01:53,960
about this place in
the "New Yorker"?

1478
01:01:53,960 --> 01:01:55,503
-It wasn't exactly
"The New Yorker,"

1479
01:01:55,503 --> 01:01:57,505
but what's the difference?

1480
01:01:57,505 --> 01:01:58,840
Every time you
guys come to town,

1481
01:01:58,840 --> 01:02:00,508
we go to some
boring Broadway play

1482
01:02:00,508 --> 01:02:02,594
and then over to Joe Allen's.

1483
01:02:02,594 --> 01:02:04,471
I just thought you'd
appreciate something

1484
01:02:04,471 --> 01:02:06,932
different for a change.

1485
01:02:06,932 --> 01:02:10,810
-It looks fine to me.

1486
01:02:10,810 --> 01:02:15,398
-[speaking spanish]

1487
01:02:27,243 --> 01:02:30,455
-Here you go, and someone
will be with you shortly.

1488
01:02:30,455 --> 01:02:31,247
-Come.

1489
01:02:31,247 --> 01:02:34,125
Come, come.

1490
01:02:34,125 --> 01:02:35,585
-Jesus, Ma!

1491
01:02:35,585 --> 01:02:37,170
You forgot the tostones again!

1492
01:02:37,170 --> 01:02:38,588
-I can't be expected
to remember everything.

1493
01:02:38,588 --> 01:02:39,547
-[speaking spanish]

1494
01:02:39,547 --> 01:02:40,215
-They're right there
in front of you!

1495
01:02:40,215 --> 01:02:41,508
-[speaking spanish]

1496
01:02:41,508 --> 01:02:43,176
-And you, when you finish
playing Ricardo Montalban,

1497
01:02:43,176 --> 01:02:44,970
could you give me a hand
in the kitchen, please!

1498
01:02:44,970 --> 01:02:45,929
-Hey Ricky.

1499
01:02:45,929 --> 01:02:47,138
You gotta bus
table number seven.

1500
01:02:50,558 --> 01:02:51,851
-Welcome to Mambo Cafe.

1501
01:02:51,851 --> 01:02:54,062
Uh, can I get you something
to drink before you start?

1502
01:02:54,062 --> 01:02:54,854
-Yup.

1503
01:02:54,854 --> 01:02:58,149
I'd like a water.

1504
01:02:58,149 --> 01:03:00,402
-Chris?

1505
01:03:00,402 --> 01:03:03,446
Just what are you doing here?

1506
01:03:03,446 --> 01:03:05,323
-What am I doing here?

1507
01:03:05,323 --> 01:03:07,200
What am I doing here?

1508
01:03:07,200 --> 01:03:10,578
You're supposed to be in-- in
Argentina, for Christ's sake.

1509
01:03:10,578 --> 01:03:12,414
What about your sick mother?

1510
01:03:12,414 --> 01:03:16,543
--[speaking spanish] I'm
your mother, not your slave.

1511
01:03:16,543 --> 01:03:17,669
Remember to pick up your orders.

1512
01:03:17,669 --> 01:03:19,337
I can't keep bringing
them out here for you.

1513
01:03:19,337 --> 01:03:20,046
Here.

1514
01:03:23,550 --> 01:03:25,051
-Oh my god.

1515
01:03:25,051 --> 01:03:26,845
I can explain this.

1516
01:03:26,845 --> 01:03:29,139
See, I was going to tell you.

1517
01:03:29,139 --> 01:03:30,390
It's just that-- uh.

1518
01:03:30,390 --> 01:03:31,224
-Chris.

1519
01:03:31,224 --> 01:03:35,979
Who is this person?

1520
01:03:35,979 --> 01:03:40,233
-Dad, this is Nydia.

1521
01:03:40,233 --> 01:03:44,529
Nydia, this is my father and
my mother and my sister Stacy.

1522
01:03:44,529 --> 01:03:45,363
-Hi, Nydia.

1523
01:03:45,363 --> 01:03:46,281
-Hi.

1524
01:03:46,281 --> 01:03:49,451
It's a pleasure to
meet all of you.

1525
01:03:49,451 --> 01:03:50,577
Listen, Chris.

1526
01:03:50,577 --> 01:03:52,746
I can explain this, OK?

1527
01:03:52,746 --> 01:03:53,830
-Let me get this straight.

1528
01:03:53,830 --> 01:03:56,833
This is the Nydia
we're supposed to meet?

1529
01:03:56,833 --> 01:03:59,961
-How did you say you two met?

1530
01:03:59,961 --> 01:04:01,254
-I'm getting another headache.

1531
01:04:01,254 --> 01:04:02,172
-Chr-- Chris!

1532
01:04:02,172 --> 01:04:03,715
Hold this, please.

1533
01:04:03,715 --> 01:04:05,550
Chris, wait a second.

1534
01:04:05,550 --> 01:04:08,011
Please, Chris, I
know how this looks.

1535
01:04:08,011 --> 01:04:10,638
But please, give me
a chance to explain.

1536
01:04:10,638 --> 01:04:11,765
-Nydia.

1537
01:04:11,765 --> 01:04:14,017
I don't understand how
you could do this to me?

1538
01:04:14,017 --> 01:04:15,185
-I admit it.

1539
01:04:15,185 --> 01:04:16,811
It was stupid.

1540
01:04:16,811 --> 01:04:19,939
I should have been straight
from the beginning.

1541
01:04:19,939 --> 01:04:22,400
But can you honestly say
that you wouldn't have

1542
01:04:22,400 --> 01:04:24,235
done what every
other guy ever does?

1543
01:04:24,235 --> 01:04:25,528
-What?

1544
01:04:25,528 --> 01:04:26,946
-You know, Chris.

1545
01:04:26,946 --> 01:04:29,991
In your city exotics
for a couple of months.

1546
01:04:29,991 --> 01:04:30,825
-Come on, Nydia.

1547
01:04:30,825 --> 01:04:32,702
-Maybe even a whole semester.

1548
01:04:32,702 --> 01:04:35,497
And then, the second they
start hinting of anything

1549
01:04:35,497 --> 01:04:37,707
more than a little
cuchi-cuchi, out

1550
01:04:37,707 --> 01:04:40,293
comes their hundred
and one excuses.

1551
01:04:40,293 --> 01:04:41,211
-Cuchi-cuchi?

1552
01:04:41,211 --> 01:04:42,962
You know somehow
that really sounds

1553
01:04:42,962 --> 01:04:44,297
appropriate with
what you're wearing.

1554
01:04:44,297 --> 01:04:45,590
-I was going to tell you.

1555
01:04:45,590 --> 01:04:46,800
-When!

1556
01:04:46,800 --> 01:04:49,219
-I just wanted us to
know each other better.

1557
01:04:49,219 --> 01:04:50,929
-Yeah, well, I guess I got
to know you pretty well,

1558
01:04:50,929 --> 01:04:51,638
didn't I, Nydia?

1559
01:05:05,318 --> 01:05:06,152
-Trust me.

1560
01:05:06,152 --> 01:05:07,904
You got off easy.

1561
01:05:07,904 --> 01:05:09,489
Six months with
my boring brother,

1562
01:05:09,489 --> 01:05:11,032
you would have been
ready for a lobotomy.

1563
01:05:17,664 --> 01:05:18,873
-We shouldn't have
left her in Puerto

1564
01:05:18,873 --> 01:05:22,001
Rico for all those years.

1565
01:05:22,001 --> 01:05:25,046
I feel like it's all my fault.

1566
01:05:25,046 --> 01:05:29,050
-Frank, it's no one's fault.

1567
01:05:29,050 --> 01:05:33,513
We brought her here
as soon as we could.

1568
01:05:33,513 --> 01:05:35,348
-Yeah.

1569
01:05:35,348 --> 01:05:36,099
Maybe you're right.

1570
01:05:40,812 --> 01:05:42,647
-Hey.

1571
01:05:42,647 --> 01:05:43,439
You OK?

1572
01:05:46,442 --> 01:05:49,070
-Just the way his parents
were looking at me,

1573
01:05:49,070 --> 01:05:55,160
like I had ruined their
precious son or something.

1574
01:05:55,160 --> 01:05:57,620
-You know how some
people are, huh?

1575
01:05:57,620 --> 01:05:59,581
I mean I go through
that same kind of stuff

1576
01:05:59,581 --> 01:06:00,832
when I'm trying to sell things.

1577
01:06:00,832 --> 01:06:02,458
If the box doesn't
say Tiffany's, they

1578
01:06:02,458 --> 01:06:06,379
can't see that there still might
be a priceless stone inside.

1579
01:06:06,379 --> 01:06:08,631
-Hmm.

1580
01:06:08,631 --> 01:06:11,968
-You mind if I
ask you something?

1581
01:06:11,968 --> 01:06:15,471
I-- I just don't
understand why you

1582
01:06:15,471 --> 01:06:17,765
have to go around pretending
to be somebody else.

1583
01:06:17,765 --> 01:06:21,352
Because to me you're the most
intelligent and beautiful woman

1584
01:06:21,352 --> 01:06:22,061
I've ever met.

1585
01:06:25,815 --> 01:06:28,526
-Manny, why?

1586
01:06:28,526 --> 01:06:31,738
Why do you continue
to be nice to me?

1587
01:06:31,738 --> 01:06:34,449
I've been treating
you like such a--

1588
01:06:34,449 --> 01:06:35,200
-No argument there.

1589
01:06:38,411 --> 01:06:41,247
But we're friends, and it just
doesn't make any sense to me

1590
01:06:41,247 --> 01:06:43,583
to ruin all those
nice memories just

1591
01:06:43,583 --> 01:06:47,754
because we're going
our separate ways.

1592
01:06:47,754 --> 01:06:49,422
-Can I ask you a question?

1593
01:06:49,422 --> 01:06:51,925
MANNY: Go ahead.

1594
01:06:51,925 --> 01:06:55,136
-What is going to happen to you?

1595
01:06:55,136 --> 01:06:59,766
I mean you're intelligent, and
you're a terrific salesman.

1596
01:06:59,766 --> 01:07:03,811
I think you can
do bigger things.

1597
01:07:03,811 --> 01:07:06,147
You should have your
own store, maybe even

1598
01:07:06,147 --> 01:07:09,901
expanding to a
chain or something.

1599
01:07:09,901 --> 01:07:13,947
Maybe-- maybe you should
take some business classes.

1600
01:07:13,947 --> 01:07:15,740
-Thanks.

1601
01:07:15,740 --> 01:07:18,451
But I think college is a
little out of my league.

1602
01:07:18,451 --> 01:07:20,536
-What are you talking about?

1603
01:07:20,536 --> 01:07:23,206
Manny, three-quarters of
the people in my class

1604
01:07:23,206 --> 01:07:26,292
don't have half the
talent you have.

1605
01:07:26,292 --> 01:07:29,212
[phone ringing]

1606
01:07:33,299 --> 01:07:34,384
-Harvard's on the phone.

1607
01:07:41,683 --> 01:07:43,142
-Go ahead.

1608
01:07:43,142 --> 01:07:44,143
Go, go.

1609
01:07:44,143 --> 01:07:46,104
-Ah, be right back, OK?

1610
01:07:46,104 --> 01:07:46,980
-Yeah, yeah.

1611
01:07:56,322 --> 01:07:57,490
-No, it's OK.

1612
01:07:57,490 --> 01:07:59,200
It's OK, Chris.

1613
01:07:59,200 --> 01:08:02,662
Um, I-- I'm really glad
you called me back.

1614
01:08:02,662 --> 01:08:06,624
You know, everything--
everything was really crazy.

1615
01:08:06,624 --> 01:08:09,669
Yeah, I'm sorry
about everything.

1616
01:08:09,669 --> 01:08:11,879
Um, can I call you in a moment?

1617
01:08:11,879 --> 01:08:12,672
OK.

1618
01:08:12,672 --> 01:08:14,173
All right.

1619
01:08:14,173 --> 01:08:15,174
Manny!

1620
01:08:15,174 --> 01:08:15,883
Manny!

1621
01:08:47,874 --> 01:08:49,000
Look, Chris.

1622
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:55,631
Um, I-- I'm really very
sorry about everything.

1623
01:08:55,631 --> 01:08:58,718
I mean this whole
thing has turned

1624
01:08:58,718 --> 01:09:00,636
into an absolute nightmare.

1625
01:09:00,636 --> 01:09:02,263
-I'm sorry, too.

1626
01:09:02,263 --> 01:09:04,599
Especially about my
initial reaction.

1627
01:09:04,599 --> 01:09:06,642
You know, it was just really
strange that you were--

1628
01:09:06,642 --> 01:09:07,435
-No, no, no.

1629
01:09:07,435 --> 01:09:09,395
Believe me, it was my fault.

1630
01:09:09,395 --> 01:09:10,521
I--

1631
01:09:10,521 --> 01:09:12,023
-I am still curious
about something, though.

1632
01:09:12,023 --> 01:09:14,484
I would have to
find out some time.

1633
01:09:14,484 --> 01:09:17,945
What did you think
would happen then?

1634
01:09:17,945 --> 01:09:21,908
-I don't know what is
going to happen, Chris.

1635
01:09:25,244 --> 01:09:29,499
-I-- I think we should
continue to talk.

1636
01:09:35,004 --> 01:09:36,422
Look, that didn't
exactly come out right.

1637
01:09:36,422 --> 01:09:40,051
What I mean is I think
we should start again.

1638
01:09:42,637 --> 01:09:45,181
I mean if that's what you want.

1639
01:09:45,181 --> 01:09:48,601
-I'd really like that.

1640
01:09:48,601 --> 01:09:50,770
-Great.

1641
01:09:50,770 --> 01:09:51,479
-Great.

1642
01:09:59,404 --> 01:10:00,863
-Oh, boy.

1643
01:10:00,863 --> 01:10:02,323
-What's wrong?

1644
01:10:02,323 --> 01:10:05,076
-Billy and Marissa are there
and they go to school with me.

1645
01:10:05,076 --> 01:10:06,452
-So?

1646
01:10:06,452 --> 01:10:09,789
-So-- so I already told them
about you being from Argentina.

1647
01:10:09,789 --> 01:10:12,166
Billy and I have
always been competitive

1648
01:10:12,166 --> 01:10:13,501
and I'll never
hear the end of it

1649
01:10:13,501 --> 01:10:17,797
once he finds out you're from,
you know, Spanish Harlem.

1650
01:10:17,797 --> 01:10:20,675
Look, would you mind if we left
it like that for right now?

1651
01:10:20,675 --> 01:10:22,718
It's just too complicated
to get into this whole thing

1652
01:10:22,718 --> 01:10:24,053
right now.

1653
01:10:24,053 --> 01:10:28,057
-Chris-- Chris,
if you don't mind,

1654
01:10:28,057 --> 01:10:31,060
I'd really like to
put that behind us.

1655
01:10:31,060 --> 01:10:34,230
You're going to have him
sooner or later anyway.

1656
01:10:34,230 --> 01:10:36,482
-Could you just do this for me?

1657
01:10:36,482 --> 01:10:38,901
It's a lot easier
this way for us.

1658
01:10:38,901 --> 01:10:40,153
Oh, look, there's Adam.

1659
01:10:40,153 --> 01:10:44,907
I didn't realize he come
back from Australia already.

1660
01:10:44,907 --> 01:10:45,700
Ha!

1661
01:10:45,700 --> 01:10:46,701
Hello!

1662
01:10:46,701 --> 01:10:48,870
-Hey!

1663
01:10:48,870 --> 01:10:49,662
How are ya!

1664
01:10:49,662 --> 01:10:50,496
-Hello!

1665
01:10:50,496 --> 01:10:51,664
-Hey!

1666
01:10:51,664 --> 01:10:54,208
-Nice to see you!

1667
01:10:54,208 --> 01:10:55,001
-All right.

1668
01:10:55,001 --> 01:10:56,335
-Everyone, this is Nydia.

1669
01:10:56,335 --> 01:10:59,255
Nydia, this is Billy, Amy, Lynn.

1670
01:10:59,255 --> 01:11:00,548
That's Marissa and Adam.

1671
01:11:00,548 --> 01:11:01,424
-Hi.

1672
01:11:01,424 --> 01:11:02,717
-I hope you remember all that.

1673
01:11:02,717 --> 01:11:04,510
You'll be tested on it later.

1674
01:11:04,510 --> 01:11:06,345
-So you're from Argentina.

1675
01:11:06,345 --> 01:11:07,346
-Yeah.

1676
01:11:07,346 --> 01:11:09,015
-Do you know that
my brother actually

1677
01:11:09,015 --> 01:11:12,435
met Gabriella Sabatini when
he was there last month?

1678
01:11:12,435 --> 01:11:14,395
-Well, actually, I am not--

1679
01:11:14,395 --> 01:11:16,689
-Nydia's actually
from a different part

1680
01:11:16,689 --> 01:11:18,775
of Argentina than Gabriella.

1681
01:11:18,775 --> 01:11:20,193
Isn't that right, Nydia?

1682
01:11:20,193 --> 01:11:23,196
Don't you live in a
different part of Argentina?

1683
01:11:23,196 --> 01:11:24,322
-Yes, Chris.

1684
01:11:24,322 --> 01:11:26,699
It's a good two hours away.

1685
01:11:26,699 --> 01:11:28,868
-This guy has always had
a thing for Latin women,

1686
01:11:28,868 --> 01:11:29,744
like you wouldn't believe.

1687
01:11:29,744 --> 01:11:31,162
Remember that Italian girl?

1688
01:11:31,162 --> 01:11:32,997
She was related to
the Ferrari family.

1689
01:11:32,997 --> 01:11:37,084
She had an al-- this ranch
in the Alps of the Poconos

1690
01:11:37,084 --> 01:11:39,003
or some damn
place-- 4,000 acres.

1691
01:11:39,003 --> 01:11:40,421
-Billy, don't you
think Chris might want

1692
01:11:40,421 --> 01:11:41,589
to share those
stories with Nydia--

1693
01:11:41,589 --> 01:11:42,256
-Yeah.

1694
01:11:42,256 --> 01:11:42,965
- --some other time?

1695
01:11:42,965 --> 01:11:44,175
-You're right.

1696
01:11:44,175 --> 01:11:48,054
In my condition I wouldn't
do them justice anyway.

1697
01:11:48,054 --> 01:11:50,306
So how many acres
does your ranch have?

1698
01:11:50,306 --> 01:11:51,724
-Billy!

1699
01:11:51,724 --> 01:11:52,850
-It's not so big.

1700
01:11:52,850 --> 01:11:55,311
About 12,000 acres.

1701
01:11:55,311 --> 01:11:56,229
-12,000 acres?

1702
01:11:56,229 --> 01:11:57,480
-Nydia.

1703
01:11:57,480 --> 01:11:59,398
-Well that-- that's like
that's as big as Rhode Island.

1704
01:11:59,398 --> 01:12:01,901
-But that's just our
place in Argentina.

1705
01:12:01,901 --> 01:12:05,112
We also have a beautiful
place in the South of France

1706
01:12:05,112 --> 01:12:08,616
that my great aunt
Eva Peron bought.

1707
01:12:08,616 --> 01:12:11,744
It's not as large, but it's
so perfect for Christmas

1708
01:12:11,744 --> 01:12:12,829
gatherings.

1709
01:12:12,829 --> 01:12:14,580
But let me tell you something.

1710
01:12:14,580 --> 01:12:19,085
My absolute most favorite
place is actually

1711
01:12:19,085 --> 01:12:22,380
this quaint little island
off the coast of Greece

1712
01:12:22,380 --> 01:12:25,091
that my father won from
Onassis in a poker game.

1713
01:12:25,091 --> 01:12:26,384
It's incredible.

1714
01:12:26,384 --> 01:12:28,386
We have dolphins and
that gorgeous view.

1715
01:12:28,386 --> 01:12:29,637
-Excuse me.

1716
01:12:29,637 --> 01:12:31,055
Excuse us.

1717
01:12:31,055 --> 01:12:32,974
Would you mind if I speak to you
over here for a minute, please.

1718
01:12:32,974 --> 01:12:33,933
-Of course, my love.

1719
01:12:33,933 --> 01:12:34,684
-All right.

1720
01:12:34,684 --> 01:12:35,601
-Could you excuse us?

1721
01:12:38,479 --> 01:12:41,774
-She has a place for
Christmas gatherings.

1722
01:12:41,774 --> 01:12:42,733
-What are you doing?

1723
01:12:42,733 --> 01:12:44,652
Are you trying to humiliate me?

1724
01:12:44,652 --> 01:12:46,362
-I'm doing exactly what
you asked me to do,

1725
01:12:46,362 --> 01:12:49,365
Chris-- to keep
lying, which says

1726
01:12:49,365 --> 01:12:50,866
a lot about how seriously
you're taking this.

1727
01:12:50,866 --> 01:12:53,661
-Look, I have every
intention of telling them.

1728
01:12:53,661 --> 01:12:55,830
I just didn't want
to do it right now.

1729
01:12:55,830 --> 01:12:57,665
-Let's face it, Chris.

1730
01:12:57,665 --> 01:12:59,709
You don't want to do it now.

1731
01:12:59,709 --> 01:13:03,838
You don't want to do it ever.

1732
01:13:03,838 --> 01:13:05,881
Look, it's getting pretty late.

1733
01:13:05,881 --> 01:13:09,844
I have to be getting back.

1734
01:13:09,844 --> 01:13:12,305
-Well, let me say goodbye
and I'll take you home.

1735
01:13:12,305 --> 01:13:13,806
-It's OK, Chris.

1736
01:13:13,806 --> 01:13:15,766
Why don't you stay
with your friends?

1737
01:13:15,766 --> 01:13:19,186
I can get a cab.

1738
01:13:19,186 --> 01:13:19,937
-Are you sure?

1739
01:13:22,982 --> 01:13:23,983
-Yeah.

1740
01:13:23,983 --> 01:13:27,445
I'm sure.

1741
01:13:27,445 --> 01:13:28,863
Take care of yourself, OK?

1742
01:14:29,548 --> 01:14:33,052
[knocking]

1743
01:14:33,052 --> 01:14:34,804
-Do you have a minute?

1744
01:14:34,804 --> 01:14:36,222
-Of course, Dad.

1745
01:14:36,222 --> 01:14:39,392
--[sighs] You know, we,
uh, been so busy lately,

1746
01:14:39,392 --> 01:14:42,061
we haven't had a chance to talk.

1747
01:14:42,061 --> 01:14:47,066
So how you feeling?

1748
01:14:47,066 --> 01:14:48,943
-I'm OK.

1749
01:14:48,943 --> 01:14:52,238
I just-- you know, Dad.

1750
01:14:52,238 --> 01:14:56,242
-I mean with Chris
and everything.

1751
01:14:56,242 --> 01:14:59,745
-I don't think we're going to
be seeing each other anymore,

1752
01:14:59,745 --> 01:15:01,747
if that's what you want to know.

1753
01:15:01,747 --> 01:15:03,874
-Hmm.

1754
01:15:03,874 --> 01:15:05,501
This isn't going
to effect anything?

1755
01:15:05,501 --> 01:15:07,753
I mean, you know, with
school and everything.

1756
01:15:07,753 --> 01:15:10,589
-Dad, Dad, we're going
to different schools.

1757
01:15:10,589 --> 01:15:16,220
-Oh, because, you know,
when we set our goals,

1758
01:15:16,220 --> 01:15:18,806
there's always
something pinching

1759
01:15:18,806 --> 01:15:23,602
you here and pulling
at you there.

1760
01:15:23,602 --> 01:15:26,772
This restaurant, for example,
oh, it's had some good times,

1761
01:15:26,772 --> 01:15:30,776
but most of the time it's just
a big pain in the you know what.

1762
01:15:30,776 --> 01:15:34,739
I guess what I'm trying to tell
you is that this place is not

1763
01:15:34,739 --> 01:15:38,367
going to get us a mansion
in Long Island or anything.

1764
01:15:38,367 --> 01:15:40,745
The only reason we
keep hanging in there,

1765
01:15:40,745 --> 01:15:45,040
it's because, well, for us
it's doing something much more

1766
01:15:45,040 --> 01:15:48,627
important, and that
is it's allowing

1767
01:15:48,627 --> 01:15:51,422
you to be our first
college graduate.

1768
01:15:57,845 --> 01:16:00,681
This is, uh, part of
your tuition money.

1769
01:16:00,681 --> 01:16:03,017
I figured that would at
least get you a seat.

1770
01:16:03,017 --> 01:16:06,771
We'll worry about sending
the rest to you later.

1771
01:16:06,771 --> 01:16:09,607
Because who knows what could
happen from here, right?

1772
01:16:09,607 --> 01:16:11,150
Huh?

1773
01:16:11,150 --> 01:16:13,819
I mean, you can grow
up to be the president

1774
01:16:13,819 --> 01:16:17,823
of your own company, or
maybe one of your kids

1775
01:16:17,823 --> 01:16:19,325
could be a senator.

1776
01:16:19,325 --> 01:16:22,495
Hey, how about President of
the United States, why not?

1777
01:16:22,495 --> 01:16:23,329
Huh?

1778
01:16:23,329 --> 01:16:23,829
-Thanks.

1779
01:16:23,829 --> 01:16:24,997
Thanks, Dad.

1780
01:16:24,997 --> 01:16:27,792
But let me just finish
next semester first, OK?

1781
01:16:27,792 --> 01:16:28,834
-Yeah, yeah.

1782
01:16:28,834 --> 01:16:30,169
Guess, uh, just keep
doing what you're

1783
01:16:30,169 --> 01:16:36,801
doing, because we're
all very proud of you.

1784
01:16:36,801 --> 01:16:37,676
-Thank you, Dad.

1785
01:16:43,265 --> 01:16:44,016
[door closing]

1786
01:16:47,895 --> 01:16:49,438
-Frank.

1787
01:16:49,438 --> 01:16:50,439
Frank.

1788
01:16:50,439 --> 01:16:51,398
Come in here, hurry up.

1789
01:16:51,398 --> 01:16:52,399
-What is it?

1790
01:16:52,399 --> 01:16:55,361
-Look.

1791
01:16:55,361 --> 01:16:57,530
-What are they doing here?

1792
01:16:57,530 --> 01:16:58,364
Well, hurry up.

1793
01:16:58,364 --> 01:16:59,865
Turn off the lights.

1794
01:16:59,865 --> 01:17:01,826
-It's too late for that, Frank.

1795
01:17:01,826 --> 01:17:02,743
[knocking]

1796
01:17:06,705 --> 01:17:07,623
[knocking]

1797
01:17:20,386 --> 01:17:22,721
-Hey, Frank, how you doing?

1798
01:17:22,721 --> 01:17:25,558
Mind if we come inside?

1799
01:17:25,558 --> 01:17:26,892
-Uh, I'm doing OK.

1800
01:17:26,892 --> 01:17:28,519
How are you guys doing?

1801
01:17:28,519 --> 01:17:30,104
-Not too good.

1802
01:17:30,104 --> 01:17:31,313
You see, there's
this little problem

1803
01:17:31,313 --> 01:17:34,191
we've got to take care of.

1804
01:17:34,191 --> 01:17:35,734
Maybe it's better if
we talked out here.

1805
01:17:35,734 --> 01:17:37,319
-Yeah, sure, whatever you say.

1806
01:17:39,864 --> 01:17:40,573
-Ma.

1807
01:17:43,784 --> 01:17:46,328
Ma, what are you doing?

1808
01:17:46,328 --> 01:17:47,621
-Those two idiotas are back.

1809
01:18:11,937 --> 01:18:14,315
-What did they want?

1810
01:18:14,315 --> 01:18:17,443
-They said the mafia didn't
do the hit on fat Tony

1811
01:18:17,443 --> 01:18:19,278
and that they didn't like
other people sticking

1812
01:18:19,278 --> 01:18:21,530
their nose and their business.

1813
01:18:21,530 --> 01:18:23,824
Then they started
to ask me where

1814
01:18:23,824 --> 01:18:25,784
Ricky was when fat Tony got hit.

1815
01:18:25,784 --> 01:18:26,619
-What?

1816
01:18:26,619 --> 01:18:27,453
Do they think that Ricky--

1817
01:18:27,453 --> 01:18:29,622
-They wanted to talk to him.

1818
01:18:29,622 --> 01:18:32,374
So I lied, told them
that he was sleeping

1819
01:18:32,374 --> 01:18:34,543
over at a friend's house.

1820
01:18:34,543 --> 01:18:35,669
Then I thought about it.

1821
01:18:35,669 --> 01:18:39,214
I remembered that Ricky
wasn't in the restaurant

1822
01:18:39,214 --> 01:18:40,841
when Tony got hit.

1823
01:18:40,841 --> 01:18:43,427
-So that's good, isn't it?

1824
01:18:43,427 --> 01:18:45,304
-No, not really.

1825
01:18:45,304 --> 01:18:47,264
-So what are you saying,
Frank, that Ricky

1826
01:18:47,264 --> 01:18:49,099
was in the car
shooting those bullets?

1827
01:18:49,099 --> 01:18:50,517
-Hey, don't yell at me.

1828
01:18:50,517 --> 01:18:51,810
I'm not saying anything.

1829
01:18:51,810 --> 01:18:53,228
It's them.

1830
01:18:53,228 --> 01:18:54,146
-This is crazy.

1831
01:18:54,146 --> 01:18:55,105
Ricky!

1832
01:18:55,105 --> 01:18:55,940
Ricky!

1833
01:18:55,940 --> 01:18:57,942
Ricky, come down here right now.

1834
01:18:57,942 --> 01:18:58,817
-Yeah, what?

1835
01:18:58,817 --> 01:18:59,652
What is it?

1836
01:18:59,652 --> 01:19:01,362
I finished all my work already.

1837
01:19:07,993 --> 01:19:10,746
What?

1838
01:19:10,746 --> 01:19:11,997
I got stuff on my
face or something?

1839
01:19:14,625 --> 01:19:18,837
-Ricky, do you know
how fat Tony, you know,

1840
01:19:18,837 --> 01:19:21,173
came to his end?

1841
01:19:21,173 --> 01:19:22,007
-Yeah.

1842
01:19:22,007 --> 01:19:23,968
He got wasted in a drive by.

1843
01:19:23,968 --> 01:19:25,511
Why are you asking me that?

1844
01:19:25,511 --> 01:19:27,846
-Because those two
idiotas were just here,

1845
01:19:27,846 --> 01:19:29,264
and they said that
none of them did it.

1846
01:19:29,264 --> 01:19:30,641
And now they're
trying to find out

1847
01:19:30,641 --> 01:19:33,936
who did do it so they can bury
him a pair of cement boots.

1848
01:19:33,936 --> 01:19:36,021
Ricky, do you know
anything about that?

1849
01:19:36,021 --> 01:19:37,773
-So what are you
say, that I did it?

1850
01:19:37,773 --> 01:19:39,066
-We're not saying anything.

1851
01:19:39,066 --> 01:19:40,109
It's just that--

1852
01:19:40,109 --> 01:19:41,986
-Look, those guys
don't know jack, OK?

1853
01:19:41,986 --> 01:19:43,529
They can't prove anything.

1854
01:19:43,529 --> 01:19:45,531
-Ricky, these are not
your little friends

1855
01:19:45,531 --> 01:19:47,074
you're playing with here.

1856
01:19:47,074 --> 01:19:49,535
Those monsters don't
have to prove anything.

1857
01:19:49,535 --> 01:19:51,036
-I'm only going to ask
you this once, Ricky.

1858
01:19:51,036 --> 01:19:52,913
Do you know anything
about this or not?

1859
01:19:52,913 --> 01:19:54,081
-Look, I've got to
get out of here.

1860
01:19:54,081 --> 01:19:54,957
-No, you don't!

1861
01:20:10,014 --> 01:20:12,391
-You know, I'm not so sure
this is such a good idea.

1862
01:20:12,391 --> 01:20:13,767
-I don't need you
lecturing me right now.

1863
01:20:13,767 --> 01:20:16,228
I told you, we've looked
for him everywhere.

1864
01:20:16,228 --> 01:20:18,230
I just want to talk to them, OK?

1865
01:20:18,230 --> 01:20:19,064
-What about the police?

1866
01:20:19,064 --> 01:20:20,357
-The police?

1867
01:20:20,357 --> 01:20:23,235
And tell them what, that
my little brother killed

1868
01:20:23,235 --> 01:20:24,695
some mafia guys,
so they can throw

1869
01:20:24,695 --> 01:20:26,488
him in jail the
rest of his life?

1870
01:20:26,488 --> 01:20:29,241
Manny, are you going to
help me with this or not?

1871
01:20:35,456 --> 01:20:40,169
-Look, uh, Manny here keeps me
looking sharp with new suits

1872
01:20:40,169 --> 01:20:42,463
at the end of each month.

1873
01:20:42,463 --> 01:20:44,715
And right now I'd like
to help you guys out.

1874
01:20:44,715 --> 01:20:48,761
But what you're asking me to
do is to violate a code that's

1875
01:20:48,761 --> 01:20:51,764
been with us for hundreds
upon hundreds of years,

1876
01:20:51,764 --> 01:20:53,223
going back to when?

1877
01:20:53,223 --> 01:20:56,393
-Our earliest
ancestors in Italy.

1878
01:20:56,393 --> 01:20:59,813
-Your families must always take
care of their own business.

1879
01:20:59,813 --> 01:21:01,940
I'm sorry, but no can do.

1880
01:21:01,940 --> 01:21:04,443
-Hey, Joey, what do you
know about this painting?

1881
01:21:04,443 --> 01:21:07,071
Does it go like this?

1882
01:21:07,071 --> 01:21:08,447
Or does it go like this?

1883
01:21:08,447 --> 01:21:09,364
-No, no.

1884
01:21:09,364 --> 01:21:10,324
-I know, but we're
thinking about--

1885
01:21:13,786 --> 01:21:17,790
-Look, I don't understand
what the big deal is.

1886
01:21:17,790 --> 01:21:20,959
I'm sure anybody who even
looked at that Fat Tony pig

1887
01:21:20,959 --> 01:21:23,629
for more than a second
would be happy he's gone.

1888
01:21:23,629 --> 01:21:26,340
-Miss, you don't
seem to understand.

1889
01:21:26,340 --> 01:21:30,844
Granted, anybody from here to
Istanbul wanted this guy dead.

1890
01:21:30,844 --> 01:21:32,638
But what is it
going to look like?

1891
01:21:32,638 --> 01:21:33,972
Every time we have
a little problem,

1892
01:21:33,972 --> 01:21:37,476
somebody from the outside
comes in to clean it up for us.

1893
01:21:37,476 --> 01:21:40,896
I mean, this is about honor.

1894
01:21:40,896 --> 01:21:43,816
It's a matter of respect.

1895
01:21:43,816 --> 01:21:45,984
Now you tell me,
how am I supposed

1896
01:21:45,984 --> 01:21:48,946
to go out in public after
something like this?

1897
01:21:48,946 --> 01:21:51,323
-I'll tell you.

1898
01:21:51,323 --> 01:21:54,827
Maybe this will help you.

1899
01:21:54,827 --> 01:21:55,661
-No.

1900
01:21:55,661 --> 01:21:56,328
Ah!

1901
01:21:56,328 --> 01:21:56,995
-What are you doing?

1902
01:21:56,995 --> 01:21:57,830
-That hurt.

1903
01:21:57,830 --> 01:21:59,081
-Manny, are you OK?

1904
01:21:59,081 --> 01:22:01,083
-How can you do me like this?

1905
01:22:01,083 --> 01:22:06,171
Out of the kindness of my
heart, I agreed to-- oh, shit.

1906
01:22:06,171 --> 01:22:08,257
What time is it?

1907
01:22:08,257 --> 01:22:10,175
Come on, hit it.

1908
01:22:10,175 --> 01:22:13,011
[music playing]

1909
01:22:13,011 --> 01:22:16,974
(SINGING) Give my
regards to Broadway.

1910
01:22:16,974 --> 01:22:20,811
Remember me the Herald Square.

1911
01:22:20,811 --> 01:22:27,985
Tell all the gang at 42nd Street
that I will soon be there.

1912
01:22:27,985 --> 01:22:31,989
Remember how I've been
yearning to mingle

1913
01:22:31,989 --> 01:22:34,825
with the old time prong.

1914
01:22:34,825 --> 01:22:38,120
Oh, give my regards
to old Broadway,

1915
01:22:38,120 --> 01:22:42,541
and tell them I'll
be there along.

1916
01:22:42,541 --> 01:22:44,376
-All right, Joey.

1917
01:22:44,376 --> 01:22:46,712
[clapping]

1918
01:22:46,712 --> 01:22:47,796
-Good, good.

1919
01:22:47,796 --> 01:22:49,214
Look, if it's not
enough, maybe I can--

1920
01:22:49,214 --> 01:22:49,965
-What are we playing?

1921
01:22:49,965 --> 01:22:50,883
-Hey, put me down.

1922
01:22:50,883 --> 01:22:52,718
You--

1923
01:22:52,718 --> 01:22:53,844
-Hey, hey, take it easy, OK?

1924
01:22:53,844 --> 01:22:56,305
Look, you don't even have to--

1925
01:22:56,305 --> 01:23:00,350
-And stay the hell out.

1926
01:23:00,350 --> 01:23:01,226
Shut up!

1927
01:23:08,525 --> 01:23:11,153
-You're really something
special, you know that?

1928
01:23:11,153 --> 01:23:13,405
Why do you always think
you're the only one

1929
01:23:13,405 --> 01:23:14,990
who knows to do anything?

1930
01:23:14,990 --> 01:23:16,241
-Manny, I'm sorry.

1931
01:23:16,241 --> 01:23:17,117
Are you OK?

1932
01:23:17,117 --> 01:23:18,202
-No.

1933
01:23:18,202 --> 01:23:20,579
No, I'm not OK.

1934
01:23:20,579 --> 01:23:22,956
And another thing, where
did you get all that money?

1935
01:23:22,956 --> 01:23:24,708
-It was my tuition money.

1936
01:23:24,708 --> 01:23:28,086
I was supposed to
put it in the bank.

1937
01:23:28,086 --> 01:23:29,922
What are we going to do?

1938
01:23:29,922 --> 01:23:32,925
-What are we-- what
are we gonna do?

1939
01:23:32,925 --> 01:23:34,635
The money's gone.

1940
01:23:34,635 --> 01:23:36,094
You blew it.

1941
01:23:36,094 --> 01:23:38,263
-I was talking about Ricky.

1942
01:23:38,263 --> 01:23:41,642
-I don't know what we're
going to do about Ricky, OK?

1943
01:23:41,642 --> 01:23:42,893
I just wish I would
have saved you

1944
01:23:42,893 --> 01:23:44,394
the money so you can
go back to Boston.

1945
01:23:51,026 --> 01:23:52,444
-What happened?

1946
01:23:52,444 --> 01:23:54,029
-It's my fault.

1947
01:23:54,029 --> 01:23:58,116
I asked Manny to take me to
this crazy singing mafia guy.

1948
01:23:58,116 --> 01:24:02,079
They slapped him around,
and I lost my tuition money.

1949
01:24:02,079 --> 01:24:03,121
-You what?

1950
01:24:03,121 --> 01:24:04,581
-But Ricky didn't do it.

1951
01:24:04,581 --> 01:24:06,625
He's back here already.

1952
01:24:06,625 --> 01:24:07,626
RICKY: See what I mean?

1953
01:24:07,626 --> 01:24:09,795
Nobody ever listens
to anything I say.

1954
01:24:09,795 --> 01:24:11,797
For the millionth time,
I didn't do it, OK?

1955
01:24:11,797 --> 01:24:12,965
El Loco was the one that did it.

1956
01:24:12,965 --> 01:24:14,174
He did it on his own.

1957
01:24:14,174 --> 01:24:15,801
And now I got to be hiding
out in this stupid dress

1958
01:24:15,801 --> 01:24:16,927
till we can figure
out what to do.

1959
01:24:16,927 --> 01:24:19,054
-What the hell does El
Loco have to do with it?

1960
01:24:19,054 --> 01:24:20,764
Why would he do
something like this?

1961
01:24:20,764 --> 01:24:23,809
-Hey, I don't know, because
he's El Loco, that's all.

1962
01:24:23,809 --> 01:24:26,770
Look, I told them once how we
couldn't get rid of Fat Tony,

1963
01:24:26,770 --> 01:24:28,981
so I guess he just decided
to do us all a favor.

1964
01:24:28,981 --> 01:24:30,315
-Hey, hey, hey.
Wait a minute.

1965
01:24:30,315 --> 01:24:31,483
What's the big deal?

1966
01:24:31,483 --> 01:24:33,527
All we have to do is go
over there and explain

1967
01:24:33,527 --> 01:24:35,988
to these guys, and we get
the money back, right?

1968
01:24:35,988 --> 01:24:38,240
-Frank, what are
you talking about?

1969
01:24:38,240 --> 01:24:40,659
This poor crazy boy goes out
and risks his life for us,

1970
01:24:40,659 --> 01:24:41,910
and now we're going
to hand him over

1971
01:24:41,910 --> 01:24:44,663
to these monsters
for a lousy $3,000?

1972
01:24:44,663 --> 01:24:47,332
-All right, all right,
it's a bad idea.

1973
01:24:47,332 --> 01:24:49,293
But they still think
that Ricky did it,

1974
01:24:49,293 --> 01:24:50,669
so what are we going to do?

1975
01:24:50,669 --> 01:24:54,006
-OK, Nydia, you take Ricky back
to Gilberto's and hide him out.

1976
01:24:54,006 --> 01:24:57,175
And Manny, you take me over
see these mafia guys right now.

1977
01:24:57,175 --> 01:24:57,968
-Are you crazy?

1978
01:24:57,968 --> 01:24:59,970
You cannot reason with them.

1979
01:24:59,970 --> 01:25:02,055
-Well, there's no way
I'm going over there.

1980
01:25:02,055 --> 01:25:03,765
These guys have a thing
about not hitting women

1981
01:25:03,765 --> 01:25:06,101
and taking everything
out on men.

1982
01:25:06,101 --> 01:25:08,854
-Carmen, whatever you're
thinking, forget about it.

1983
01:25:08,854 --> 01:25:11,732
I'm going to figure out a
way to get us out of this.

1984
01:25:11,732 --> 01:25:12,858
-OK.

1985
01:25:12,858 --> 01:25:14,651
All of those in favor of
me going out and finding

1986
01:25:14,651 --> 01:25:16,945
these sons of bitches
myself and hitting them

1987
01:25:16,945 --> 01:25:18,530
over the head with
a very hard bat

1988
01:25:18,530 --> 01:25:22,617
until they agree to leave my son
Ricky alone, raise your hands.

1989
01:25:22,617 --> 01:25:24,453
-OK, obviously it's
a unanimous decision.

1990
01:25:24,453 --> 01:25:25,245
-Carmen.

1991
01:25:25,245 --> 01:25:27,122
-Ma.

1992
01:25:27,122 --> 01:25:28,415
-What are you--

1993
01:25:31,418 --> 01:25:32,961
-There's one thing
I can say about you

1994
01:25:32,961 --> 01:25:36,882
people is you got a lot nerve.

1995
01:25:36,882 --> 01:25:38,633
-I know you're a
very busy man, and we

1996
01:25:38,633 --> 01:25:40,719
really appreciate you seeing us.

1997
01:25:40,719 --> 01:25:42,471
But I also understand
that you want

1998
01:25:42,471 --> 01:25:45,265
to do bodily harm
to my only son.

1999
01:25:45,265 --> 01:25:47,476
And I just want you to
look me straight in the eye

2000
01:25:47,476 --> 01:25:50,395
and not see me as a
woman but as a mother,

2001
01:25:50,395 --> 01:25:53,857
and believe me when I tell you
that there's no way in hell I

2002
01:25:53,857 --> 01:25:57,486
am ever going to allow
that to happen, OK?

2003
01:25:57,486 --> 01:26:00,155
-That's not what she meant.

2004
01:26:00,155 --> 01:26:01,823
You've got to understand
Puerto Rican women.

2005
01:26:01,823 --> 01:26:03,033
I mean, they're so dramatic.

2006
01:26:03,033 --> 01:26:04,242
-Don't get me wrong.

2007
01:26:04,242 --> 01:26:06,161
I also understand that
you're a very powerful man

2008
01:26:06,161 --> 01:26:08,872
and that at any time you
could take us out and have

2009
01:26:08,872 --> 01:26:11,583
us buried under
20 tons of cement.

2010
01:26:11,583 --> 01:26:15,379
But as the son of what I am
sure is a very wonderful woman,

2011
01:26:15,379 --> 01:26:18,590
I need for you to believe
that I know my son

2012
01:26:18,590 --> 01:26:20,467
and that there's no
way that boy could

2013
01:26:20,467 --> 01:26:23,720
ever do anything like that.

2014
01:26:23,720 --> 01:26:25,931
-May I speak now?

2015
01:26:25,931 --> 01:26:27,265
-Go ahead.

2016
01:26:27,265 --> 01:26:28,892
-You don't seem to understand.

2017
01:26:28,892 --> 01:26:31,061
I'm in a spot here.

2018
01:26:31,061 --> 01:26:33,980
I got people I've
got to answer to.

2019
01:26:33,980 --> 01:26:36,233
I got to take care of this.

2020
01:26:36,233 --> 01:26:39,486
[phone ringing]

2021
01:26:39,486 --> 01:26:40,946
-Yeah.

2022
01:26:40,946 --> 01:26:43,115
I don't give a shit
if his entire family

2023
01:26:43,115 --> 01:26:44,449
got a heart attack.

2024
01:26:44,449 --> 01:26:46,785
This is my daughter's wedding.

2025
01:26:46,785 --> 01:26:50,956
We got one day, and every
caterer from here to Hoboken's

2026
01:26:50,956 --> 01:26:53,041
already booked.

2027
01:26:53,041 --> 01:26:55,001
You found this bum.

2028
01:26:55,001 --> 01:26:58,338
You got two hours to
come up with somebody.

2029
01:26:58,338 --> 01:27:01,425
-So you-- you have
a daughter too?

2030
01:27:01,425 --> 01:27:04,845
Our daughter, she's got one
year left at Boston University.

2031
01:27:04,845 --> 01:27:07,556
-Yeah, we met.

2032
01:27:07,556 --> 01:27:12,811
-Look, Mr. Joey, me and you, we
have a lot of things in common.

2033
01:27:12,811 --> 01:27:15,313
We both came from
another country.

2034
01:27:15,313 --> 01:27:19,484
We're both trying to do
our best for our children.

2035
01:27:19,484 --> 01:27:24,281
Uh, of course we go about
it in different ways.

2036
01:27:24,281 --> 01:27:27,659
What I'm saying here
is that guys like us,

2037
01:27:27,659 --> 01:27:30,996
we got to work together.

2038
01:27:30,996 --> 01:27:34,875
As a matter of fact, I even
think I might have found a way

2039
01:27:34,875 --> 01:27:37,085
to get you out of this
little predicament you

2040
01:27:37,085 --> 01:27:39,087
have with your
daughter's wedding.

2041
01:27:39,087 --> 01:27:41,256
-Oh, yeah?

2042
01:27:41,256 --> 01:27:43,133
How you gonna do that?

2043
01:27:43,133 --> 01:27:46,011
-Well, we could cater
the wedding for you.

2044
01:27:49,306 --> 01:27:52,225
-Thanks, but I don't
think Puerto Rican

2045
01:27:52,225 --> 01:27:53,935
food will go over too
well with this crowd.

2046
01:27:53,935 --> 01:27:56,605
-Excuse me, Joey, I
think it's a good idea.

2047
01:27:56,605 --> 01:27:58,607
Think about it.

2048
01:27:58,607 --> 01:28:00,859
-Yeah, Joey, we've
been eating there for,

2049
01:28:00,859 --> 01:28:03,153
what, Carmen, a couple of weeks?

2050
01:28:03,153 --> 01:28:04,863
-Seems like a lifetime.

2051
01:28:04,863 --> 01:28:08,200
-It's your call, Joey, but,
uh, I got to go on record here,

2052
01:28:08,200 --> 01:28:10,368
this woman's food
is exceptional.

2053
01:28:10,368 --> 01:28:12,537
-And I don't mean to step
on your toes either, Joey,

2054
01:28:12,537 --> 01:28:15,999
but exotic cuisines
seem to be in this year.

2055
01:28:15,999 --> 01:28:17,375
Remember that
Hawaiian luau thing

2056
01:28:17,375 --> 01:28:19,711
at Pauly's daughter's wedding?

2057
01:28:19,711 --> 01:28:21,004
-And how about
that Jamaican think

2058
01:28:21,004 --> 01:28:22,923
Angelo threw for Gianpaulo's
birthday party last month?

2059
01:28:22,923 --> 01:28:27,219
I saw you, you were eating and
you were-- and the limbo, huh?

2060
01:28:27,219 --> 01:28:29,596
Right?

2061
01:28:29,596 --> 01:28:32,432
-I'll tell you
what-- you say you're

2062
01:28:32,432 --> 01:28:36,186
sure your son
didn't do Fat Tony?

2063
01:28:36,186 --> 01:28:40,357
You know what, I believe you.

2064
01:28:40,357 --> 01:28:43,235
And you know why,
because I think you

2065
01:28:43,235 --> 01:28:45,612
people know who did it.

2066
01:28:45,612 --> 01:28:50,700
So I'll tell you
what I'm going to do,

2067
01:28:50,700 --> 01:28:52,202
I'm going to make
a deal with you.

2068
01:28:52,202 --> 01:28:57,082
You can handle the catering,
and we'll forget about your son,

2069
01:28:57,082 --> 01:29:01,461
on one condition, you
tell me who did it.

2070
01:29:01,461 --> 01:29:02,921
Now look, like I
told you before,

2071
01:29:02,921 --> 01:29:05,507
I got people I got to answer to.

2072
01:29:05,507 --> 01:29:10,929
You tell me who did
it, and I guarantee you

2073
01:29:10,929 --> 01:29:15,350
I'll take care of it so
everybody is nice and happy.

2074
01:29:15,350 --> 01:29:16,726
Hit it!

2075
01:29:16,726 --> 01:29:21,022
(SINGING) So one of these days,
you're gonna miss me, baby.

2076
01:29:21,022 --> 01:29:23,775
So one of these days,
you're gonna be so lonely.

2077
01:29:27,195 --> 01:29:28,446
-El Loco doesn't look dead.

2078
01:29:28,446 --> 01:29:30,490
He looks like he got spilled
ketchup on his chest.

2079
01:29:30,490 --> 01:29:32,576
I could have done
better than that myself.

2080
01:29:32,576 --> 01:29:33,702
-What are you talking about?

2081
01:29:33,702 --> 01:29:35,412
I saw plenty of guys
in this position,

2082
01:29:35,412 --> 01:29:37,706
and I'm tell you, that's
the way they look.

2083
01:29:37,706 --> 01:29:38,832
-Yeah.

2084
01:29:38,832 --> 01:29:40,417
And we already showed
them to some dead beats,

2085
01:29:40,417 --> 01:29:41,501
and you should
have seen how fast

2086
01:29:41,501 --> 01:29:42,752
they coughed up they money.

2087
01:29:42,752 --> 01:29:44,379
-Yeah, right.

2088
01:29:44,379 --> 01:29:47,507
Look at this, no dead guy would
be holding a yo-yo in his hand.

2089
01:29:47,507 --> 01:29:49,926
Listen, can I get one of these
so I can show it to El Loco?

2090
01:29:49,926 --> 01:29:51,052
He's in Puerto Rico.

2091
01:29:51,052 --> 01:29:52,470
-Yeah, I'm sure he could
use a good laugh by now.

2092
01:29:52,470 --> 01:29:53,513
-Yeah.

2093
01:29:53,513 --> 01:29:54,723
-Don't show that to
anybody, you hear?

2094
01:29:54,723 --> 01:29:55,932
-Yeah, I won't.

2095
01:29:55,932 --> 01:29:57,309
-You know, I talked to
his father in Puerto Rico.

2096
01:29:57,309 --> 01:29:59,477
He said he was going
to stay in the pig farm

2097
01:29:59,477 --> 01:30:00,895
until he's old enough
for social security.

2098
01:30:00,895 --> 01:30:01,688
-Yeah, he better.

2099
01:30:01,688 --> 01:30:02,814
He'll get really whacked.

2100
01:30:02,814 --> 01:30:04,316
-No, no, no.

2101
01:30:04,316 --> 01:30:05,275
Don't let the paper fall off.

2102
01:30:05,275 --> 01:30:06,484
-OK, OK.

2103
01:30:06,484 --> 01:30:08,153
-Don't tilt it, because
the juices will fall out.

2104
01:30:08,153 --> 01:30:09,029
-You got it, OK.

2105
01:30:09,029 --> 01:30:09,821
-OK.

2106
01:30:09,821 --> 01:30:11,114
That's right.

2107
01:30:11,114 --> 01:30:12,365
No, not on the
seat, on the floor.

2108
01:30:15,493 --> 01:30:16,494
Frank--

2109
01:30:16,494 --> 01:30:19,247
-Yeah, yeah.

2110
01:30:19,247 --> 01:30:20,498
-Coming.

2111
01:30:20,498 --> 01:30:22,417
Joey says thanks, and he's
sorry he couldn't be here,

2112
01:30:22,417 --> 01:30:24,252
but he's still rehearsing
for his daughter's wedding.

2113
01:30:24,252 --> 01:30:25,045
-Is he?

2114
01:30:25,045 --> 01:30:27,464
-Oh, I almost forgot.

2115
01:30:27,464 --> 01:30:28,673
I want you to have this.

2116
01:30:28,673 --> 01:30:29,841
-Oh.

2117
01:30:29,841 --> 01:30:31,801
"Joey Sings Christmas."

2118
01:30:31,801 --> 01:30:33,178
Oh, that's wonderful.

2119
01:30:33,178 --> 01:30:34,638
Frank.

2120
01:30:34,638 --> 01:30:36,348
-Yeah, "Killing Me Softly."

2121
01:30:36,348 --> 01:30:37,098
-Wonderful.

2122
01:30:53,365 --> 01:30:55,367
-Hi.

2123
01:30:55,367 --> 01:30:57,827
-Hi.

2124
01:30:57,827 --> 01:30:59,496
Is everything all right?

2125
01:30:59,496 --> 01:31:00,830
-Yeah.

2126
01:31:00,830 --> 01:31:03,208
Ricky told me you were taking
classes here, and I-- I--

2127
01:31:03,208 --> 01:31:06,044
-Oh, um, yeah, well,
I-- I did a lot

2128
01:31:06,044 --> 01:31:08,380
of thinking about what
you said about not

2129
01:31:08,380 --> 01:31:10,548
living up to my potential.

2130
01:31:10,548 --> 01:31:12,967
-Well, I think this is great.

2131
01:31:12,967 --> 01:31:15,595
I'm so proud of you.

2132
01:31:15,595 --> 01:31:16,346
Manny.

2133
01:31:24,771 --> 01:31:31,236
Look, uh, I just wanted to
tell you that I'm really

2134
01:31:31,236 --> 01:31:32,612
very sorry about
everything, Manny.

2135
01:31:35,615 --> 01:31:37,909
I've been confused
about the little things,

2136
01:31:37,909 --> 01:31:39,828
and I'm still trying
to work them out.

2137
01:31:42,580 --> 01:31:45,542
Anyway, I just wanted
you to know that.

2138
01:31:48,586 --> 01:31:51,089
I still care about
you very much.

2139
01:31:51,089 --> 01:32:00,098
And I-- I guess I just
wanted you to know that.

2140
01:32:00,098 --> 01:32:01,933
Look, I have to be getting
back to the restaurant.

2141
01:32:07,313 --> 01:32:09,441
-Nydia.

2142
01:32:09,441 --> 01:32:12,861
Look, uh, about this
whole college thing,

2143
01:32:12,861 --> 01:32:17,323
um, I don't know if I can do
it full time, like you do.

2144
01:32:17,323 --> 01:32:19,701
But I thought I'd start out
with maybe a course or two

2145
01:32:19,701 --> 01:32:21,619
and, uh, see how it goes.

2146
01:32:21,619 --> 01:32:23,747
-Manny, this is going
to be so easy for you.

2147
01:32:26,708 --> 01:32:27,709
Look at this.

2148
01:32:27,709 --> 01:32:31,087
They have really
good professors here.

2149
01:32:31,087 --> 01:32:32,964
Manny, can ask you a question?

2150
01:32:32,964 --> 01:32:36,217
Have you figured out what all
this is going to cost you?

2151
01:32:36,217 --> 01:32:37,802
-See, there you go again.

2152
01:32:37,802 --> 01:32:39,179
-What?

2153
01:32:39,179 --> 01:32:41,055
-You know, you're probably going
to faint when you hear this,

2154
01:32:41,055 --> 01:32:43,516
but you know, there are actually
some guys around here who don't

2155
01:32:43,516 --> 01:32:46,102
spend their paychecks every week
hanging out and drinking beer.

2156
01:32:46,102 --> 01:32:47,979
You know, sometimes we even
put some of it in the bank.

2157
01:32:47,979 --> 01:32:48,813
-Will you just stop it.

2158
01:32:48,813 --> 01:32:49,939
That's not what I meant.

2159
01:32:49,939 --> 01:32:52,066
-Even if I did this, I'd
have to go full time.

2160
01:32:52,066 --> 01:32:53,735
It's not like I'm going
to leave the neighborhood

2161
01:32:53,735 --> 01:32:55,820
and go to some fancy
school up north.

2162
01:32:55,820 --> 01:32:57,947
You know, I could
afford a couple thousand

2163
01:32:57,947 --> 01:33:00,366
dollars a semester, OK?

2164
01:33:00,366 --> 01:33:01,159
I've got to go.

2165
01:33:01,159 --> 01:33:03,787
-Just shut up for a minute.

2166
01:33:03,787 --> 01:33:05,663
Manny, I was asking for me.

2167
01:33:08,374 --> 01:33:10,960
-So what are you saying, that
you want to transfer down here?

2168
01:33:10,960 --> 01:33:13,713
-Well, I was just thinking,
since I was going to be here

2169
01:33:13,713 --> 01:33:17,133
anyway, maybe I should take
a couple of those business

2170
01:33:17,133 --> 01:33:20,011
courses and then get
them transferred later on

2171
01:33:20,011 --> 01:33:21,846
or something.

2172
01:33:21,846 --> 01:33:24,849
-Nydia, this is
going to be great.

2173
01:33:24,849 --> 01:33:27,685
I mean, you could
write my papers for me.

2174
01:33:27,685 --> 01:33:28,812
You could do my research.

2175
01:33:28,812 --> 01:33:30,230
I mean, you could take notes.

2176
01:33:30,230 --> 01:33:31,105
-Wait a minute.

2177
01:33:31,105 --> 01:33:32,190
Wait a minute.

2178
01:33:32,190 --> 01:33:33,399
I've been studying
business out of books.

2179
01:33:33,399 --> 01:33:35,401
If anything, you
should be helping me.

2180
01:33:35,401 --> 01:33:37,153
-But this is only going to
be for a semester, right?

2181
01:33:37,153 --> 01:33:38,696
I mean, you are going
to go back up there,

2182
01:33:38,696 --> 01:33:42,408
because I don't want you giving
up and feeling like a failure.

2183
01:33:42,408 --> 01:33:44,661
-Oh, you don't
want me giving up?

2184
01:33:44,661 --> 01:33:46,246
-Well, yeah, I mean,
the last thing I need

2185
01:33:46,246 --> 01:33:49,541
is a girlfriend with
a self-esteem problem.

2186
01:33:49,541 --> 01:33:53,545
-Oh, so now I'm your
girlfriend again?

2187
01:33:53,545 --> 01:33:59,092
Hey, aren't we assuming
a little too much here?

2188
01:33:59,092 --> 01:34:00,885
Hmm?

2189
01:34:00,885 --> 01:34:02,136
Manny, have you
ever noticed what

2190
01:34:02,136 --> 01:34:04,305
the first three
letters of assume are?

2191
01:34:24,409 --> 01:34:29,038
