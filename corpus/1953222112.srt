Yup. I'm goin' fishin'.

82
00:13:13,913 --> 00:13:17,385
Cut their heads off

86
00:13:27,825 --> 00:13:32,675
Same thing. I cut their heads off
right there in the woods...

87
00:13:33,035 --> 00:13:34,935
Then I rip 'em open...

88
00:13:34,985 --> 00:13:39,735
...gut 'em, and fry me up
some genuine old deer meat.

92
00:13:56,965 --> 00:14:00,115
You cut their heads off?

93

Sure do.

94
00:14:03,665 --> 00:14:08,765
Same thing. Clean their heads up some
and hang 'em up on the wall.

95
00:14:09,095 --> 00:14:11,545
I got two of 'em
hangin' up in the latrine.
