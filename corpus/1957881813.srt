00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:05,225
Look at that, man.

175
00:07:06,393 --> 00:07:07,560
(grunting)

176
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:08,762
Okay.

177
00:07:08,762 --> 00:07:10,397
(static blaring)

178
00:07:10,397 --> 00:07:13,333
(incoherent radio chatter)

179
00:07:16,036 --> 00:07:17,037
What's the matter now?

180
00:07:19,172 --> 00:07:20,807
You're just
such a big shot.

181
00:07:20,807 --> 00:07:22,776
The way you treat people,
it's so dumb.

182
00:07:22,776 --> 00:07:25,712
Hey, Cozart's
done hard time, okay?

183
00:07:26,813 --> 00:07:28,315
He owes me money.

184
00:07:28,315 --> 00:07:30,317
And that kid idiot is
just bad business anyway.

185
00:07:30,317 --> 00:07:31,985
You should stay away
from him, all right?

186
00:07:31,985 --> 00:07:33,253
(sighing)

187
00:07:33,253 --> 00:07:35,221
Well, you must be the world's
authority on being good.

188
00:07:35,221 --> 00:07:37,290
I mean, you're just
so squeaky clean.

189
00:07:43,163 --> 00:07:44,164
Wanna drive?

190
00:07:46,232 --> 00:07:47,233
You serious?

191
00:07:47,233 --> 00:07:48,501
Absolutely.

192
00:07:48,501 --> 00:07:50,270
You don't ace your permit,
you're no kid of mine.

193
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:51,271
Okay.
All right, come on.

194
00:07:51,271 --> 00:07:52,439
Now?
Yeah, now, come on.

195
00:07:52,439 --> 00:07:53,473
Oh...
Careful.

196
00:07:56,176 --> 00:07:57,344
All right.
Don't push me
on the brakes.

197
00:07:57,344 --> 00:07:58,812
I got it.
Oh...

198
00:07:58,812 --> 00:08:00,280
I'm steering,
just get your legs down.
Oh, don't-- don't--

199
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:01,715
don't take your
feet off the gas.
(horn honking)

200
00:08:01,715 --> 00:08:02,782
I'm on the wheel
and on the gas.

201
00:08:03,783 --> 00:08:05,185
All right, all right.

202
00:08:05,185 --> 00:08:06,419
Wait, wait, don't--
don't let go.
You got the wheel?

203
00:08:06,419 --> 00:08:07,420
No, I don't.

204
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:08,421
Just one sec.

205
00:08:08,421 --> 00:08:09,422
All right?
Okay.

206
00:08:09,422 --> 00:08:10,423
Okay, my foot's
off the gas.

207
00:08:10,423 --> 00:08:12,525
It's all yours,
it's all yours.

208
00:08:12,525 --> 00:08:14,294
I'm driving.
You're driving.

209
00:08:14,294 --> 00:08:15,729
I'm driving.

210
00:08:15,729 --> 00:08:17,163
(sighing)

211
00:08:20,233 --> 00:08:21,534
You wanna
know something?

212
00:08:21,534 --> 00:08:22,535
What?

213
00:08:23,737 --> 00:08:24,871
You got
a beautiful smile.

214
00:08:26,306 --> 00:08:27,374
You should
use it more often.

215
00:08:31,711 --> 00:08:32,712
(bell dinging)

216
00:08:32,712 --> 00:08:34,481
(train whistle blowing)

217
00:08:38,284 --> 00:08:39,652
(Amy)
So, what about
an allowance?

218
00:08:39,652 --> 00:08:40,653
(Johnny chuckling)

219
00:08:40,653 --> 00:08:41,654
(Johnny)
Allowance?

220
00:08:41,654 --> 00:08:42,856
Yeah, allowance.
Hey, look at this.

221
00:08:42,856 --> 00:08:43,857
Look at these
cufflinks.

222
00:08:43,857 --> 00:08:44,858
Where do you
think I got these,

223
00:08:44,858 --> 00:08:46,026
at the county fair?

224
00:08:46,026 --> 00:08:47,327
Like in one of those
little plastic bubbles

225
00:08:47,327 --> 00:08:48,728
you pick up with
the claw thing?

226
00:08:48,728 --> 00:08:50,263
Is that what you think,
like it grows on trees?

227
00:08:51,297 --> 00:08:52,298
(sighing)

228
00:08:52,298 --> 00:08:53,433
Just forget it, Dad.

229
00:08:57,937 --> 00:08:59,572
(train whistle blowing
in the distance)

230
00:09:04,778 --> 00:09:06,579
(chuckling)

231
00:09:06,579 --> 00:09:07,814
Okay, all right,
hey, hey, you want money?

232
00:09:07,814 --> 00:09:08,948
Yeah.
You want money?

233
00:09:08,948 --> 00:09:11,017
All right, two bucks an
hour down at the club.

234
00:09:11,017 --> 00:09:12,318
I don't even pay
Floyd two bucks,

235
00:09:12,318 --> 00:09:13,887
not that he's worth it.
(knocking)

236
00:09:13,887 --> 00:09:15,288
Hey, guys.

237
00:09:15,288 --> 00:09:16,289
Drinks in
the back, okay?

238
00:09:16,289 --> 00:09:17,357
(woman)
Sorry, Johnny.

239
00:09:17,357 --> 00:09:18,525
Floyd, come on,
open up, will ya?

240
00:09:18,525 --> 00:09:20,026
We're turning into a couple
of Eskimos out here.

241
00:09:21,327 --> 00:09:23,029
(man)
Seven, the winner's seven.

242
00:09:23,029 --> 00:09:24,130
(woman)
Hey, Amy, look,
I was saving it for you.

243
00:09:24,130 --> 00:09:25,765
(man)
Hey, Johnny!
Hey!

244
00:09:25,765 --> 00:09:27,467
(woman)
From New York.
(Amy) Yeah.

245
00:09:27,467 --> 00:09:28,468
You can have it.

246
00:09:28,468 --> 00:09:29,469
Hey, Tooty, how are ya?
How you doing?

247
00:09:29,469 --> 00:09:30,470
You feeling
lucky tonight?

248
00:09:30,470 --> 00:09:31,604
(man)
Jackpot!
What's going on?

249
00:09:31,604 --> 00:09:32,839
(man)
When did you get this dealer?

250
00:09:32,839 --> 00:09:34,941
Hey, how are you?
Good to see you again.

251
00:09:34,941 --> 00:09:36,075
Who's the lucky one
tonight?

252
00:09:36,075 --> 00:09:38,111
All right!

253
00:09:38,111 --> 00:09:39,112
(Floyd)
Dog Bite's on a runner.

254
00:09:39,112 --> 00:09:40,113
He can't hardly talk.

255
00:09:40,113 --> 00:09:41,347
He's already
down a grand.

256
00:09:41,347 --> 00:09:42,916
Listen, I told you,
I don't want any

257
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:44,217
crossroaders
coming in here

258
00:09:44,217 --> 00:09:45,819
unless I get
a piece of it.

259
00:09:45,819 --> 00:09:47,120
Now, am I getting
a percentage?

260
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,988
Am I getting
a piece, huh?

261
00:09:48,988 --> 00:09:50,190
Amy, your supper's
in the oven.

262
00:09:50,190 --> 00:09:51,324
And, uh,
George needs to see you.

263
00:09:51,324 --> 00:09:52,325
He's got something
for you.

264
00:09:52,325 --> 00:09:53,460
Okay.

265
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:54,527
(man)
I'll be over
sometime this afternoon

266
00:09:54,527 --> 00:09:55,895
and we'll take care of it.

267
00:09:55,895 --> 00:09:57,263
Hey, George.

268
00:09:57,263 --> 00:09:59,799
You like that?
You know what,
I have to call you back.

269
00:09:59,799 --> 00:10:01,901
Okay, yes... right.

270
00:10:01,901 --> 00:10:02,902
Okay.

271
00:10:05,038 --> 00:10:06,139
What do you mean
she just left it to me?

272
00:10:06,139 --> 00:10:07,640
You mean not my dad?

273
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:08,942
(George)
A court lawyer in
Los Angeles sent it to me

274
00:10:08,942 --> 00:10:10,276
and I have to hand it
over in person,

275
00:10:10,276 --> 00:10:12,212
and then
I am out of here.

276
00:10:12,212 --> 00:10:13,947
Hanging out in a joint
like this eight weeks

277
00:10:13,947 --> 00:10:14,948
after I pass my bar exam...

278
00:10:16,216 --> 00:10:17,450
Your dad's not my only
client anymore, you know?

279
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:19,152
I-- I got a career
to think about.

280
00:10:19,152 --> 00:10:20,620
Where-- where is it?

281
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:21,688
There's an express train
about to leave

282
00:10:21,688 --> 00:10:23,089
called
"the state of Alaska"

283
00:10:23,089 --> 00:10:24,924
and-- and your dad's standing
on the wrong platform.

284
00:10:28,928 --> 00:10:30,597
Okay, autograph there,

285
00:10:30,597 --> 00:10:31,764
next to
the red dot.

286
00:10:31,764 --> 00:10:34,267
In receipt of mother's
as per her wishes.

287
00:10:34,267 --> 00:10:36,069
Mm-hmm.
Et cetera, et cetera.

288
00:10:40,373 --> 00:10:41,741
You all right
otherwise?

289
00:10:41,741 --> 00:10:43,409
Yeah.

290
00:10:43,409 --> 00:10:44,777
Yeah, why?

291
00:10:44,777 --> 00:10:46,546
Nothing, just you've
been up here a short while

292
00:10:46,546 --> 00:10:48,581
and Alaska's kind of
extreme.

293
00:10:48,581 --> 00:10:50,183
I'm okay.

294
00:10:50,183 --> 00:10:51,284
I'm sorry about
your mom.

295
00:10:51,284 --> 00:10:54,287
I mean, I--
I never knew her but...

296
00:10:54,287 --> 00:10:55,288
(sighing)

297
00:10:55,288 --> 00:10:56,289
I'm okay.

298
00:10:56,289 --> 00:10:57,557
(man)
Miss?

299
00:10:57,557 --> 00:10:59,526
Just go on, you don't...

300
00:10:59,526 --> 00:11:01,361
want to get busted
in a joint like this.

301
00:11:04,130 --> 00:11:05,131
Right.

302
00:11:06,733 --> 00:11:07,734
Right.

303
00:11:10,737 --> 00:11:12,005
(Floyd)
You know the house
can't get beat, Johnny.

304
00:11:12,005 --> 00:11:13,973
That's because he hasn't
switched the dice yet.

305
00:11:13,973 --> 00:11:15,675
Look, do me a favor,
will ya, huh?

306
00:11:15,675 --> 00:11:16,910
Will you
stay off the dope?

307
00:11:16,910 --> 00:11:18,344
You're starting to get
an echo in the attic.

308
00:11:18,344 --> 00:11:19,812
Now go on, take this
and get out of here.

309
00:11:19,812 --> 00:11:21,114
All right, huh?

310
00:11:46,806 --> 00:11:48,608
<i> (woman on record)</i>
<i> Well, here goes.</i>

311
00:11:48,608 --> 00:11:49,642
<i> (sighing)</i>

312
00:11:49,642 --> 00:11:50,743

00:11:50,743 --> 00:11:51,778

314

<i> Amy...</i>

315
00:11:54,847 --> 00:11:56,683
<i> I want you to know that just</i>

317
00:11:58,217 --> 00:12:01,020

318
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:04,023

319
00:12:05,391 --> 00:12:07,360

320
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:09,195
<i> don't you ever let anybody</i>
<i> tell you different than that.</i>

321
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:12,398
<i> You know, the night</i>
<i> you were baptized,</i>

322
00:12:12,398 --> 00:12:14,767
<i> your godmother dreamed about</i>

00:12:16,135 --> 00:12:19,205
<i> That's when I knew</i>

324
00:12:19,205 --> 00:12:20,206
(sighing)

325
00:12:21,741 --> 00:12:23,876
<i> Amy, I wish I could have been</i>
<i> a better mom for you, I-- I...</i>

326
00:12:26,112 --> 00:12:27,513
<i> ... I do, sweetie.</i>

329
00:12:30,516 --> 00:12:32,018

330
00:12:32,018 --> 00:12:34,320
(sobbing)

331
00:12:40,159 --> 00:12:41,160
(sniffling)

332
00:12:57,510 --> 00:13:00,046
(car horn honking)

333
00:13:03,650 --> 00:13:05,385
(dog barking in the distance)

334
00:13:08,988 --> 00:13:10,456
(girl)
Hey, Sammy!
(girl) Wait up!

335
00:13:15,895 --> 00:13:17,363
(girl)
Sammy's got a crush!

336
00:13:25,371 --> 00:13:26,406
(girl)
He is, he is!

337
00:13:28,374 --> 00:13:30,076
Amy.
Hmm?

338
00:13:30,076 --> 00:13:31,544
In my country,

339
00:13:31,544 --> 00:13:34,647
when winter come,
bear, he look for cave.

340
00:13:34,647 --> 00:13:36,816
He choose most
dark cave,

341
00:13:36,816 --> 00:13:38,751
for also most warm.

342
00:13:38,751 --> 00:13:39,852
Meaning what?

343
00:13:42,789 --> 00:13:45,591
Most light
not always best cave.

344
00:13:48,161 --> 00:13:49,162
Da?

345
00:13:50,663 --> 00:13:51,698
Da.

346
00:13:51,698 --> 00:13:54,100
(school bell ringing)

347
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:55,334
Books away.

Thank you, Miss Tesky.

354
00:14:09,816 --> 00:14:11,117
Is that correct,
Miss Ross?

355
00:14:12,985 --> 00:14:15,655
Miss Ross, it appears, is
an aspiring Georgia O'Keeffe.

356
00:14:17,123 --> 00:14:19,092
Quite original too.

357
00:14:19,092 --> 00:14:21,994
However, not as original
as her assignment.

358
00:14:21,994 --> 00:14:24,197
A work of
scintillating fiction,

359
00:14:24,197 --> 00:14:27,233
most notably in the area
of dates and facts.

360

All right, scholars,
no knowledge, no college.

365
00:14:37,844 --> 00:14:40,146
And how about you, you great
flatulent hippopotamus?

367

I think you better go in for

I'll give you $25

count so good?

375

Three-pound
pinkie ring.

376
00:15:02,034 --> 00:15:03,469
Big, hot diamond.

377
00:15:03,469 --> 00:15:04,971

Uh-uh, he's saving
that for me.

378

Right, Angie?

Yeah, you wait.

380
00:15:07,373 --> 00:15:08,775
You're the one
that's gonna wait, honey.

381
00:15:08,775 --> 00:15:10,143
(woman)
That's right.

382
00:15:10,143 --> 00:15:11,577
(woman)
... gonna be a really
long time, Angie.

383
00:15:13,012 --> 00:15:14,280
Everybody's
just fooling.

384
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:15,548
We all love him,
you know that.

385
00:15:15,548 --> 00:15:17,416
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I know,
it's just show business.

Why don't you
hop in?

399
00:15:58,024 --> 00:15:59,692
I'm a pussycat,
you can ask anybody.

400
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:03,362
Come on, we'll go for a walk
on a glacier or something.

401
00:16:03,362 --> 00:16:05,264
Huh, you ever done that?

402
00:16:05,264 --> 00:16:06,566

Hey, let's pick her up!

403
00:16:08,301 --> 00:16:10,136

Go ahead and call.

404
00:16:10,136 --> 00:16:11,137

Careful.

405
00:16:18,144 --> 00:16:19,278

I'm Francis Cook.

413

414
00:16:35,328 --> 00:16:37,163
Amy.
I know.

415
00:16:37,163 --> 00:16:38,831
Ross, right?
Mm-hmm.

416
00:16:38,831 --> 00:16:40,499
Did you come
from Outside?

417
00:16:40,499 --> 00:16:42,501
Los Angeles.

418
00:16:42,501 --> 00:16:43,836
When?

419
00:16:44,871 --> 00:16:46,138
July.

420
00:16:46,138 --> 00:16:47,907
(car horn honking)

421
00:16:47,907 --> 00:16:48,908
Why?

422
00:16:50,443 --> 00:16:51,978
My mother was stuck
in a psycho ward

423
00:16:51,978 --> 00:16:54,413
for a long time,
then she got sick.

424
00:16:54,413 --> 00:16:56,282
My grandmother was too
old to look after me,

425
00:16:56,282 --> 00:16:58,985
so my dad brought me
up here for a while.

426
00:16:58,985 --> 00:17:00,553
But then my mother
went and died,

427
00:17:00,553 --> 00:17:02,188
so I guess
I'm here forever.

428
00:17:04,423 --> 00:17:05,424
I'm sorry.

429
00:17:06,893 --> 00:17:07,894
About your mother.

430
00:17:10,096 --> 00:17:11,130
I never really
knew her.

431
00:17:13,232 --> 00:17:14,734
You know that boy
you were talking to

432
00:17:14,734 --> 00:17:17,570
killed a girl who lived
out near the airport.

433
00:17:17,570 --> 00:17:19,472
He got off because of
some technical problem.

434
00:17:21,607 --> 00:17:22,608

for stopping.

they call it here.

You can drop me
anywhere.

Tell me where
you live.

444
00:17:48,567 --> 00:17:50,836
Are we gonna be friends
or is this just a ride?

446
00:17:56,475 --> 00:17:58,377

live there?

00:42:30,948 --> 00:42:32,950
There's nothing more
important than an education.

1058
00:42:32,950 --> 00:42:34,252
I sincerely believe that.

1059
00:42:34,252 --> 00:42:36,888
Exactly how do you support
her education, Mr. Ross?

1060
00:42:36,888 --> 00:42:38,322
I get her there,
rain or shine.

1061
00:42:38,322 --> 00:42:39,857
(woman)
That's it?

1062
00:42:39,857 --> 00:42:41,359
Well, what do I know
about those other things,

1063
00:42:41,359 --> 00:42:42,593
like history and so forth?

1064
00:42:42,593 --> 00:42:44,128
What do I know
about that?

1065
00:42:44,128 --> 00:42:46,431
Mr. Ross, you dropped out
of school when you were 15.

1066
00:42:46,431 --> 00:42:47,532
First criminal charge,

1067
00:42:47,532 --> 00:42:48,666
assault with
a deadly weapon--

1068
00:42:48,666 --> 00:42:50,034
(Johnny)
Hey, I was a kid,

1069
00:42:50,034 --> 00:42:53,438
I was drunk, I was waving
a broken beer bottle around.

1070
00:42:53,438 --> 00:42:54,539
What is that?

1071
00:42:54,539 --> 00:42:55,807
I object to this line
of questioning.

1072
00:42:55,807 --> 00:42:58,376
You ran numbers
in the garment district.

1073
00:42:58,376 --> 00:43:00,678
Did your father teach you
how to do that, Mr. Ross?

1074
00:43:00,678 --> 00:43:02,814
I don't
speak to my father.

1075
00:43:02,814 --> 00:43:05,817
I understand he was close
with Meyer Lansky in Miami.

1076
00:43:05,817 --> 00:43:06,818
(George)
That's enough.

1077
00:43:06,818 --> 00:43:08,052
You're badgering my cl--

1078
00:43:08,052 --> 00:43:10,988
Look, Meyer Lansky
would say hello to my father

1079
00:43:10,988 --> 00:43:13,191
when he was walking his dog
on Collins Avenue.

1080
00:43:13,191 --> 00:43:14,559
"Good morning, Mr. Lansky."

1081
00:43:14,559 --> 00:43:16,294
"Good morning,
Mr. Ross."

1082
00:43:16,294 --> 00:43:17,728
Now, is that a crime?

1083
00:43:17,728 --> 00:43:19,497
Does that make me
a lousy father?

1084
00:43:19,497 --> 00:43:20,998
Then you would like
to see your daughter

1085
00:43:20,998 --> 00:43:22,600
stay in school?

1086
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:25,169
Well, of course I'd like to
see her continue in school.

1087
00:43:25,169 --> 00:43:28,105
Not only that, but after
she finishes high school,

1088
00:43:28,105 --> 00:43:29,540
I'm gonna foot the bill

1089
00:43:29,540 --> 00:43:31,843
so that she can go on to
blackjack dealer's school

1090
00:43:31,843 --> 00:43:33,878
in Vegas... if that's
what she wants.

1091
00:43:34,979 --> 00:43:36,147
I do not believe this.

1092
00:43:38,249 --> 00:43:39,917
So, they've
got plenty of room

1093
00:43:39,917 --> 00:43:41,786
and their daughter's
about your age.

1094
00:43:41,786 --> 00:43:44,388
So we thought the two
of you might hit it off.

1095
00:43:44,388 --> 00:43:45,756
Jim?

1096
00:43:45,756 --> 00:43:47,758
Whoa...
Hello, Amy.

1097
00:43:47,758 --> 00:43:49,727
What is this, you want me
to live with a cop?

1098
00:43:49,727 --> 00:43:52,263
Forget it.
Amy...

1099
00:43:52,263 --> 00:43:53,564
(man)
I said take your
hands off of me!

1100
00:43:53,564 --> 00:43:56,601
(men shouting)

1101
00:43:56,601 --> 00:43:57,902
I am on your
side, honey.

1102
00:43:59,370 --> 00:44:00,438
I like your father.

1103
00:44:00,438 --> 00:44:01,439
He's got
a good heart.

1104
00:44:01,439 --> 00:44:02,974
I know that.

1105
00:44:02,974 --> 00:44:05,243
Trouble is, he thinks
the shortest distance

1106
00:44:05,243 --> 00:44:07,512
between two points
is an angle.

1107
00:44:07,512 --> 00:44:09,280
I mean, he works
harder to steal a nickel

1108
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:10,348
than it takes to
earn a dime.

1109
00:44:12,149 --> 00:44:14,018
Why are some
people like that?

1110
00:44:14,018 --> 00:44:15,019
Will they change?

1111
00:44:15,019 --> 00:44:16,287
I don't know.

1112
00:44:17,622 --> 00:44:18,823
I do know that
he loves you, though.

1113
00:44:20,358 --> 00:44:21,792
(sighing)

1114
00:44:21,792 --> 00:44:23,494
And I'll do
everything I can

1115
00:44:23,494 --> 00:44:25,029
to make sure that the two
of you get back together

1116
00:44:25,029 --> 00:44:26,163
in a better situation.

1117
00:44:28,065 --> 00:44:29,100
Sound fair?

1118
00:44:29,100 --> 00:44:30,301
(sighing)

1119
00:44:34,605 --> 00:44:37,875
(Jim)
Dear Father in heaven,
we thank you for this day.

1120
00:44:37,875 --> 00:44:42,146
God bless this wonderful
meal to our use...

1121
00:44:42,146 --> 00:44:43,748
and us to thy service.

1122
00:44:45,149 --> 00:44:47,118
And all God's
people said...

1123
00:44:47,118 --> 00:44:48,219
(all)
Amen.

1124
00:44:48,219 --> 00:44:49,587
Amen.

1125
00:44:49,587 --> 00:44:51,322
Amen.

1126
00:44:51,322 --> 00:44:52,557
All right, let's eat.

1127
00:44:52,557 --> 00:44:54,625
(knife whirring)

1128
00:44:58,129 --> 00:44:59,130
Movie star, huh?

1129
00:45:02,667 --> 00:45:05,169
♪♪

1130
00:45:28,793 --> 00:45:30,995
If I ever catch you with
any of my personal stuff,

1131
00:45:30,995 --> 00:45:32,430
you'll be out of here
so fast.

1132
00:45:35,333 --> 00:45:36,334
(Jim)
Bedtime, girls.

1133
00:45:36,334 --> 00:45:37,635
Knock off the chatter.

1134
00:45:37,635 --> 00:45:38,803
Good night, Dad.

1135
00:45:38,803 --> 00:45:39,870
Good night.

1136
00:45:41,639 --> 00:45:42,640
He thinks doing this

1137
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:45,409
is some kind of huge
favor for mankind.

1138
00:45:45,409 --> 00:45:47,511
But your type

Beautiful color, scarlet,
don't you think?

1142
00:46:12,770 --> 00:46:14,238
Yeah.

1143
00:46:14,238 --> 00:46:15,406
Useful word, too.

1144
00:46:17,375 --> 00:46:20,711
"Scarlet Letter,"
"Scarlet Pimpernel,"

1145
00:46:20,711 --> 00:46:23,981
scarlet fever...
scarlet woman.

1146
00:46:26,283 --> 00:46:27,318
Hmm?

1147
00:46:27,318 --> 00:46:28,953
You wanted to see me.

1148
00:46:28,953 --> 00:46:31,455
Words are important,
Miss Ross.

1149
00:46:31,455 --> 00:46:32,657
They define
what you will be become.

1150
00:46:34,625 --> 00:46:37,528
You do want to become
something, don't you?

1151
00:46:37,528 --> 00:46:39,463
Yeah.

1152
00:46:39,463 --> 00:46:40,731
I don't know.

1153
00:46:50,174 --> 00:46:53,577
"Every atom belonging
to me as good...

1154
00:46:53,577 --> 00:46:54,578
belongs to you."

Far out.

1157
00:47:16,801 --> 00:47:18,235
(girl)
I'd sort of like
a dad like that.

1158
00:47:18,235 --> 00:47:19,837
(girl)
I don't know.

1159
00:47:21,405 --> 00:47:22,406
(girl)
Look at the way he's dressed.

1160
00:47:22,406 --> 00:47:23,808
He's hilarious,
isn't he?

1161

(girl)
Wow...

1162

Get in.

1163
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:30,881
Please,
get in the car.

Go, go!

1166
00:47:39,924 --> 00:47:40,958
What's the problem
with you?

1167
00:47:40,958 --> 00:47:41,959
Just drive!

I got permission,
if you want.

For what?

1172
00:47:48,365 --> 00:47:50,134
To be together,
just for the weekend.

1173
00:47:50,134 --> 00:47:52,136
You can help me
fix up my place.

1174
00:47:52,136 --> 00:47:53,637
What place?

1175
00:47:55,439 --> 00:47:56,540
I got a new business.

1176

Yeah, right.

1178
00:47:58,876 --> 00:48:00,177
It's legitimate.
Mm-hmm.

1179
00:48:00,177 --> 00:48:01,645
Tell me another one.

1180
00:48:01,645 --> 00:48:03,414
Hey...

1181

I'm a man of my word.

1182
00:48:05,916 --> 00:48:06,917

What do you think?

1186
00:48:25,603 --> 00:48:27,738
Your dad made me

Hello.
Hi.

I'm here for the, uh,
demonstration.

1191

(Johnny)
Now, ladies, this is one
of my favorite stitches.

1192
00:48:40,785 --> 00:48:42,453
You insert the cam here,

1193
00:48:42,453 --> 00:48:43,988
bring your material in
under the needle,

1194
00:48:43,988 --> 00:48:46,457
roll the needle
down in, drop the lock,

1195
00:48:46,457 --> 00:48:48,159
and we begin to sew.

1196
00:48:48,159 --> 00:48:50,261
It's as
simple as that.

1197
00:48:50,261 --> 00:48:53,864

a beautiful stitch.

Nice straight line.

Isn't that amazing?
(woman)
Oh, I can't believe it.

1200
00:48:58,202 --> 00:49:00,204
One of our
more perfect stitches.

1201
00:49:00,204 --> 00:49:02,907
It's a miracle.
Yes, it is.

1202
00:49:02,907 --> 00:49:05,376
Now, when you finish,
you bring the needle up,

1203
00:49:05,376 --> 00:49:07,111
drop the lock off here,

1204
00:49:07,111 --> 00:49:08,813
pull the material out,
take a snip,

1205
00:49:08,813 --> 00:49:11,448
and you have an
extraordinary stitch.

1206
00:49:11,448 --> 00:49:12,449
Now, this deluxe model

1207
00:49:12,449 --> 00:49:13,851

50 different times.

Yes, indeed.

two plus two, okay?

1222
00:49:42,279 --> 00:49:43,747
Ask me the hard stuff.

1223
00:49:43,747 --> 00:49:45,115
Hey, look,
check this out.

00:49:45,115 --> 00:49:47,117
Three-way bulb.

Better for the eyes.

Come on, you're old enough,
you're smart.

1227
00:49:50,621 --> 00:49:51,856
We should be talking
about important things,

1228
00:49:51,856 --> 00:49:52,857
like world events.

1229
00:49:52,857 --> 00:49:54,658
Come on,
ask me anything.

1230
00:49:54,658 --> 00:49:56,594
Geography, history,
science, go ahead.

Um, um...

00:49:58,929 --> 00:50:00,164
Okay, okay, um...

1233
00:50:01,232 --> 00:50:03,234
How big...
is the moon?

1234
00:50:05,002 --> 00:50:06,003
The moon, huh?

1235
00:50:07,271 --> 00:50:08,973
(sighing)

1236
00:50:08,973 --> 00:50:10,441
That's a tough one.

1237
00:50:10,441 --> 00:50:11,876
The moon...

1238
00:50:11,876 --> 00:50:12,977
It's pretty big,
I know that.

1239
00:50:15,279 --> 00:50:17,414
I know, I know,
let's look it up.

1240
00:50:21,952 --> 00:50:23,287
Encyclopedia Britannica.

1241
00:50:23,287 --> 00:50:24,855
(laughing)

1242
00:50:24,855 --> 00:50:25,856
I read
the whole thing.

1243
00:50:25,856 --> 00:50:27,057
Very good books.

1244
00:50:27,057 --> 00:50:30,094
(blues playing)

1245
00:50:45,442 --> 00:50:46,443
You wanna
know how it works?
Yeah.

1246
00:50:46,443 --> 00:50:47,478
Okay.

1247
00:50:47,478 --> 00:50:49,647
The flywheel
turns the crankshaft.

1248
00:50:49,647 --> 00:50:51,215
Now, that makes
the pistons

1249
00:50:51,215 --> 00:50:53,217
go up and down
in the cylinders.

1250
00:50:53,217 --> 00:50:56,754
Then the timing chain
turns the camshaft

1251
00:50:56,754 --> 00:50:59,957
so that when it rotates,
the cams operate the valves.

1252
00:50:59,957 --> 00:51:01,225
Basic rock-'n'-roll.

1253
00:51:02,927 --> 00:51:04,161

Oh... Dad.

00:51:09,466 --> 00:51:10,768
