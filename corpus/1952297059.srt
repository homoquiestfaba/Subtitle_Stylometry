1
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:45,757
- You let me out of here.

2
00:01:45,868 --> 00:01:46,855
I'll tell you anything you want.

3
00:01:47,933 --> 00:01:50,126
What do you want
me to do now?

4
00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:24,139
- Terry.

5
00:07:47,812 --> 00:07:48,800
No, no, no, no.
Wait, wait---

6
00:07:48,912 --> 00:07:50,139
- Quiet, Dick.
You got to be quiet.

7
00:07:50,246 --> 00:07:51,405
- What the fuck?

8
00:07:51,512 --> 00:07:52,500
Terry.

9
00:07:54,779 --> 00:07:55,869
- Yeah, I told you.

10
00:07:55,978 --> 00:07:57,740
I told you this
would happen, Julian.

11
00:07:57,845 --> 00:07:58,834
- Holy shit.

12
00:07:59,946 --> 00:08:01,275
Fuck. Fuck.

13
00:08:01,379 --> 00:08:02,367
No.

14
00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:04,069
- You said you'd be here, man.

15
00:08:04,178 --> 00:08:05,871
You said you'd be here, Julian.

16
00:08:05,978 --> 00:08:07,603
- This is not happening.

17
00:08:12,178 --> 00:08:13,268
- Julian.

18
00:08:13,378 --> 00:08:14,809
Julian, listen to me.

19
00:08:14,910 --> 00:08:17,070
Julian.

20
00:08:17,177 --> 00:08:18,336
Why weren't you here?

21
00:09:08,408 --> 00:09:10,600
- Two outs now.

22
00:09:15,141 --> 00:09:16,300
- Nah, man, I'm Cuban.

23
00:09:16,408 --> 00:09:18,600
- Good thing we ain't playing
for clothes.

24
00:09:18,707 --> 00:09:20,172
- If we were playing
for clothes,

25
00:09:20,274 --> 00:09:21,705
he would have been naked
for the past 4 1/2 hours.

26
00:09:21,806 --> 00:09:22,794
- Shut up, man.

27
00:09:22,906 --> 00:09:24,702
Yo, I know you guys be cheating
at this shit all the time.

28
00:09:24,807 --> 00:09:26,738
- We don't cheat.

29
00:09:31,506 --> 00:09:34,405
- Um, you've got
an order here.

30
00:09:34,507 --> 00:09:36,165
- What's up, big man,
any business upstairs?

31
00:09:36,273 --> 00:09:38,898
- Whose turn is it?
- You go.

32
00:09:39,006 --> 00:09:40,938
- Chicken cordon bleu
for room 304.

33
00:09:41,039 --> 00:09:42,027
- Yeah.
- Give me two cards.

34
00:09:42,139 --> 00:09:43,127
- Chicken cordon bleu.

35
00:09:43,238 --> 00:09:44,727
Tell him we haven't had
chicken here in 30 years.

36
00:09:46,805 --> 00:09:48,134
- They want a salad with it.

37
00:09:48,238 --> 00:09:49,226
- Listen to this guy.

38
00:09:49,338 --> 00:09:50,634
Like people come here
for the food.

39
00:09:50,739 --> 00:09:52,432
- Charlie brings his wife
down here all the time.

40
00:09:52,538 --> 00:09:53,526
- Oh, yeah?

41
00:09:53,639 --> 00:09:55,502
- Maybe, but I bring my
girlfriend to the Sheraton.

42
00:09:55,605 --> 00:09:58,298
- Room 304.

43
00:10:02,971 --> 00:10:05,232
- No rest for the wicked,
huh, big man?

44
00:10:14,870 --> 00:10:16,393
- Hi.
- Good evening, miss.

45
00:10:16,504 --> 00:10:18,935
- Good evening.

46
00:10:19,037 --> 00:10:21,469
I'd like a room, please.

47
00:10:21,571 --> 00:10:24,128
- Um, yes.

48
00:10:24,237 --> 00:10:27,498
We should be able
to accommodate you.

49
00:10:44,335 --> 00:10:47,234
As for your stay, miss?

50
00:10:49,168 --> 00:10:50,259
- My stay?

51
00:10:50,369 --> 00:10:54,131
Our rates run weekly, nightly,

52
00:10:54,235 --> 00:10:56,325
and...

53
00:10:57,301 --> 00:10:58,528
by the hour.

54
00:10:58,635 --> 00:10:59,623
- By the hour?

55
00:11:04,434 --> 00:11:07,400
Just for tonight, please.

56
00:11:07,501 --> 00:11:09,432
It'll be just tonight.

57
00:11:36,932 --> 00:11:39,228
- All right, all right.

58
00:11:41,332 --> 00:11:42,923
Terry?

59
00:11:43,032 --> 00:11:44,622
- Jules.

60
00:11:47,998 --> 00:11:49,022
- Yo, man.

61
00:11:49,131 --> 00:11:53,029
- Yo.

62
00:11:53,131 --> 00:11:55,689
- What's shaking?

63
00:11:55,798 --> 00:11:59,059
- Uh, you wouldn't believe me
if I told you.

64
00:12:02,031 --> 00:12:04,996
Trust me,
I hear that.

65
00:12:05,097 --> 00:12:07,859
- You're a hard man
to track down.

66
00:12:07,964 --> 00:12:09,123
Tried your home line.

67
00:12:09,231 --> 00:12:11,355
Where you at?

68
00:12:11,464 --> 00:12:13,793
- No, man,
I'm---I'm here.

69
00:12:13,896 --> 00:12:16,556
You know, I'm home,
just kicking it in the tub.

70
00:12:18,796 --> 00:12:20,023
- You better have
some company.

71
00:12:22,097 --> 00:12:24,824
No, dude, I wish I did.

72
00:12:24,930 --> 00:12:27,952
I'm actually just soaking
this fucking knee.

73
00:12:28,062 --> 00:12:29,494
Hauser kicked my ass again.

74
00:12:29,596 --> 00:12:32,720
- You got to stop playing ball
with that guy, man.

75
00:12:32,829 --> 00:12:35,386
Thinks he's playing
every game at Rucker Park.

76
00:12:35,495 --> 00:12:37,462
- You don't need
to tell me that.

77
00:12:37,562 --> 00:12:39,357
Speaking ofwhich,
we called your ass.

78
00:12:39,462 --> 00:12:41,291
What, you can't
call people back?

79
00:12:41,395 --> 00:12:43,328
What's the matter
with you?

80
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:45,917
- You know, I was waiting
for my anytime minutes, man.

81
00:12:46,028 --> 00:12:48,051
You know, fucking
nights and weekends.

82
00:12:48,161 --> 00:12:52,184
- You and your
nights and weekends.

83
00:12:52,294 --> 00:12:54,590
Hey, I tell you what, though.

84
00:12:54,694 --> 00:12:56,852
You remember Anna?

85
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:58,256
- Anna Anna?

86
00:12:58,361 --> 00:12:59,349
- Yeah, man.

87
00:12:59,461 --> 00:13:01,892
I-I actually ran into her.

88
00:13:01,994 --> 00:13:04,517
Right, um...

89
00:13:04,628 --> 00:13:06,991
Shit, right down
the street someplace.

90
00:13:07,094 --> 00:13:08,957
- Just walking
down the street.

91
00:13:09,060 --> 00:13:10,048
- Yeah.

92
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:11,455
- The nerve of that bitch.

93
00:13:13,194 --> 00:13:15,591
Dick.

94
00:13:17,493 --> 00:13:19,254
So what about you, hmm?

95
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:20,849
How was your day?

96
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:22,925
- The day?

97
00:13:27,659 --> 00:13:31,489
You know...

98
00:13:31,592 --> 00:13:32,717
it was a day.

99
00:13:44,758 --> 00:13:47,781
- Hello?

100
00:13:47,891 --> 00:13:48,914
Terry, you there, man?

101
00:13:50,925 --> 00:13:53,516
Uh...

102
00:13:53,625 --> 00:13:54,852
I'm sorry, man, shit.

103
00:13:54,958 --> 00:13:59,083
Uh, I'm sorry,
I'm just---

104
00:13:59,191 --> 00:14:01,486
Just a little drunk,
to be honest, man.

105
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:04,284
- No shit.

106
00:14:04,391 --> 00:14:05,378
- No shit.

107
00:14:05,490 --> 00:14:08,218
- Me too.

108
00:14:08,323 --> 00:14:10,380
- Red?

109
00:14:10,490 --> 00:14:11,478
- Black.

110
00:14:11,590 --> 00:14:14,215
- Black, huh?
- Yep.

111
00:14:19,090 --> 00:14:21,612
I think I fucked up.

112
00:14:26,023 --> 00:14:29,045
I think I'm---
I'm about to fuck up.

113
00:14:31,588 --> 00:14:33,680
- You think so, huh?

114
00:14:33,788 --> 00:14:37,312
- Yeah, I think maybe so.

115
00:14:45,655 --> 00:14:46,643
- Terry, come on, man.

116
00:14:46,755 --> 00:14:48,276
What's going on?

117
00:14:51,588 --> 00:14:55,145
- It's---it's June.

118
00:14:55,687 --> 00:14:58,175
She's...

119
00:15:00,054 --> 00:15:01,951
She's cheating on me.

120
00:15:02,053 --> 00:15:04,212
- Wait a minute, what?

121
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,013
- June, she --- she's cheating.

122
00:15:17,953 --> 00:15:19,646
- You'll be happy to know

123
00:15:19,752 --> 00:15:24,447
this elevator is very reliable.

124
00:15:24,553 --> 00:15:26,882
- As opposed to?

125
00:15:30,019 --> 00:15:33,542
- The Riverview
is fully inspected

126
00:15:33,652 --> 00:15:38,744
and certified,
of course.

127
00:15:38,852 --> 00:15:41,409
But we are in a...

128
00:15:41,518 --> 00:15:45,313
transition period
currently.

129
00:15:46,985 --> 00:15:50,576
This is our only
working lift.

130
00:15:50,684 --> 00:15:53,582
- I'm quite happy
to take the stairs.

131
00:16:05,150 --> 00:16:08,912
- This room is a personal
favorite of mine.

132
00:16:09,017 --> 00:16:11,312
Everything in here
is original.

133
00:16:11,416 --> 00:16:13,974
Preserved in time.

134
00:16:15,316 --> 00:16:19,077
You'll be joining some
very distinguished company.

135
00:16:20,282 --> 00:16:21,748
- I bet.

136
00:16:21,849 --> 00:16:25,212
- Some of the first guests
at the Riverview

137
00:16:25,315 --> 00:16:27,712
were the Ambassador
to Estonia

138
00:16:27,815 --> 00:16:32,271
and the conductor
of the Chicago Philharmonic

139
00:16:32,382 --> 00:16:33,370
and...

140
00:16:35,249 --> 00:16:38,840
and, of course, uh...

141
00:16:38,948 --> 00:16:44,880
numerous celebrities
and movie stars.

142
00:16:46,615 --> 00:16:49,080
- Really? Like who?

143
00:16:49,181 --> 00:16:51,647
- Oh.

144
00:16:51,748 --> 00:16:56,645
Well, I'm not at liberty
to divulge their names.

145
00:16:57,747 --> 00:16:59,679
- Oh.

146
00:16:59,780 --> 00:17:01,711
- Um...

147
00:17:01,813 --> 00:17:06,541
But rest assured,
the names would impress you.

148
00:17:06,646 --> 00:17:08,805
- I'm sure.

149
00:17:11,879 --> 00:17:13,004
Oh.

150
00:17:19,546 --> 00:17:22,137
Thank you
for the history lesson.

151
00:17:22,246 --> 00:17:23,234
- You're welcome.

152
00:17:23,345 --> 00:17:26,107
- So here.

153
00:17:26,212 --> 00:17:28,007
- Oh, it's---
- No.

154
00:17:28,111 --> 00:17:30,237
Have a wonderful evening.

155
00:17:30,346 --> 00:17:32,903
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

156
00:17:35,712 --> 00:17:36,699
- Good night.

157
00:17:36,811 --> 00:17:38,573
- Good night.

158
00:19:19,339 --> 00:19:20,327
Hi.

159
00:19:25,771 --> 00:19:28,328
- Come on, man,
you really think she's cheating?

160
00:19:30,871 --> 00:19:33,860
- I do.

161
00:19:33,972 --> 00:19:36,732
- 'Cause, I mean, you know,
you've thought this before.

162
00:19:36,837 --> 00:19:38,894
Yeah, I know I've
thought this before.

163
00:19:39,004 --> 00:19:40,028
- You've called me.

164
00:19:40,137 --> 00:19:41,568
- I know.

165
00:19:41,670 --> 00:19:42,931
- And every time,
you end up just---

166
00:19:43,037 --> 00:19:45,696
- Feeling like
an asshole, yes.

167
00:19:45,804 --> 00:19:47,827
I know.

168
00:19:47,937 --> 00:19:50,459
It's different.

169
00:19:57,736 --> 00:19:58,724
- Okay.

170
00:19:58,836 --> 00:20:02,632
- She was supposed to be
away on business.

171
00:20:02,736 --> 00:20:06,293
The airline,
they called the house.

172
00:20:06,402 --> 00:20:07,390
She canceled her flight.

173
00:20:07,502 --> 00:20:08,934
- Just 'cause she canceled
her flight doesn't mean---

174
00:20:09,036 --> 00:20:12,433
- Then I gave the guy
at her car service a $20.

175
00:20:12,536 --> 00:20:14,434
Told me
where she was going.

176
00:20:14,536 --> 00:20:16,195
So I went to see
for myself.

177
00:20:16,302 --> 00:20:17,393
- You followed her?

178
00:20:17,502 --> 00:20:19,228
- I did...

179
00:20:21,069 --> 00:20:22,796
to the fucking hotel.

180
00:20:25,602 --> 00:20:27,363
- A hotel?
- That's right.

181
00:20:30,368 --> 00:20:31,834
- Shit.

182
00:20:34,601 --> 00:20:36,328
Oh, shit, man.

183
00:20:38,001 --> 00:20:39,626
So what are you
gonna do, huh?

184
00:20:39,734 --> 00:20:43,325
Are you gonna
confront her?

185
00:20:43,434 --> 00:20:47,093
- Yeah, you might say that.

186
00:20:48,601 --> 00:20:51,760
- Terry, where are you?

187
00:20:51,866 --> 00:20:53,025
Come on, you're not---
are you---

188
00:20:54,032 --> 00:20:56,498
Are you still at the hotel?

189
00:20:56,600 --> 00:21:00,862
- Still?

190
00:21:00,967 --> 00:21:05,058
No, not still.

191
00:21:11,265 --> 00:21:14,494
Where were you?

192
00:21:14,599 --> 00:21:15,962
Why weren't you here?

193
00:21:16,065 --> 00:21:17,053
Hmm?

194
00:21:17,165 --> 00:21:20,359
- Terry, do you know
what you've done?

195
00:21:20,465 --> 00:21:22,090
- Yeah.

196
00:21:22,198 --> 00:21:24,595
Look, look, I need you
to help me fix this.

197
00:21:24,698 --> 00:21:26,597
- Fucking stay away
from me, Terry.

198
00:21:26,698 --> 00:21:27,755
- What?
- Just stay back.

199
00:21:27,863 --> 00:21:30,455
- Jules, look,
I need your help here, man.

200
00:21:30,564 --> 00:21:31,757
That's why you
came here, right?

201
00:21:31,864 --> 00:21:33,386
So we can do this together,
like you said.

202
00:21:33,497 --> 00:21:35,690
- No, dude, I never said---
I never told you to do this.

203
00:21:35,798 --> 00:21:37,024
- You told me to wait,
and I waited.

204
00:21:37,130 --> 00:21:38,653
- Yes, fucking wait.
- You left me here.

205
00:21:38,763 --> 00:21:40,991
- Okay, so what the fuck do you
want me to do now, Terry, huh?

206
00:21:41,097 --> 00:21:43,722
What can I do about this?

207
00:21:55,363 --> 00:21:58,453
- I want to make him
pay for it.

208
00:22:25,194 --> 00:22:26,182
- Good evening, sir.

209
00:22:29,528 --> 00:22:31,687
Would you like a room?

210
00:22:31,795 --> 00:22:33,987
- A room, yeah.

211
00:22:34,094 --> 00:22:35,855
- I, um...

212
00:22:35,961 --> 00:22:37,392
I believe we have---

213
00:22:37,493 --> 00:22:41,891
- It has to be the right room.

214
00:22:41,993 --> 00:22:44,152
- You've---you've
stayed with us before?

215
00:22:44,260 --> 00:22:45,520
- I've never been here before.

216
00:22:45,626 --> 00:22:47,752
- But you have a---

217
00:22:47,859 --> 00:22:49,620
you have a particular room
in mind.

218
00:22:49,726 --> 00:22:51,692
- I don't know the number,

219
00:22:51,793 --> 00:22:55,418
but I know
what room I want.

220
00:22:55,526 --> 00:22:56,890
Is it okay if---

221
00:22:56,993 --> 00:22:58,821
Please?

222
00:23:09,959 --> 00:23:12,390
Here.

223
00:23:12,491 --> 00:23:14,390
That's her.

224
00:23:14,491 --> 00:23:16,286
I know her no matter
what name she uses.

225
00:23:16,391 --> 00:23:17,823
- One moment, sir.

226
00:23:17,925 --> 00:23:18,913
I'll ring her room.

227
00:23:19,025 --> 00:23:21,956
- No, you can't---
can't do that.

228
00:23:25,624 --> 00:23:27,215
- I'm sorry, sir,

229
00:23:27,325 --> 00:23:32,484
but I'm not allowed
to let you in unannounced.

230
00:23:32,590 --> 00:23:33,579
- Unannounced?

231
00:23:33,691 --> 00:23:38,020
- She requested privacy, sir.

232
00:23:43,390 --> 00:23:46,549
- You saw her, then?

233
00:23:46,656 --> 00:23:48,315
- Yes.

234
00:23:52,456 --> 00:23:53,717
- She's here.

235
00:23:56,723 --> 00:23:58,654
- Yes.

236
00:24:05,455 --> 00:24:08,182
- Well, I can't
let her leave, then.

237
00:24:09,689 --> 00:24:11,586
And I need you
to give me a room.

238
00:24:11,688 --> 00:24:15,415
I'm here for a room.

239
00:24:15,521 --> 00:24:17,544
Someplace across from---

240
00:24:17,654 --> 00:24:22,144
I need room 508.

241
00:24:22,254 --> 00:24:23,481
How much for the night?

242
00:24:26,087 --> 00:24:28,484
- Oh, um...

243
00:24:28,587 --> 00:24:31,418
I'm sorry.

244
00:24:31,521 --> 00:24:35,351
That room's not available
this evening.

245
00:24:51,986 --> 00:24:54,611
- Why don't we
go up there together

246
00:24:54,719 --> 00:24:58,446
and take a look?

247
00:24:58,551 --> 00:24:59,812
- I can't.

248
00:25:02,352 --> 00:25:06,444
- Surprise yourself sometimes
what you can and can't do.

249
00:25:10,085 --> 00:25:13,847
- Previous guests include
the Ambassador to Estonia

250
00:25:13,952 --> 00:25:17,645
and the conductor
of the Chicago Philharmonic.

251
00:25:19,585 --> 00:25:21,175
We never fill this room.

252
00:25:21,284 --> 00:25:24,545
The guests complain about
the sign outside the window.

253
00:25:24,650 --> 00:25:26,878
I can close
the blinds for you.

254
00:25:32,816 --> 00:25:34,680
- No, it's---
Just leave it.

255
00:25:34,784 --> 00:25:35,772
It's fine.

256
00:25:39,217 --> 00:25:41,682
There's a lot of history
to this place, huh?

257
00:25:41,783 --> 00:25:44,147
- Oh, yes, sir.

258
00:25:44,250 --> 00:25:47,943
All of the cornice work
you see is original.

259
00:25:48,050 --> 00:25:54,606
Nothing has been changed since
the day the Riverview opened.

260
00:25:54,715 --> 00:25:59,272
- I always thought
it's just better

261
00:25:59,381 --> 00:26:04,507
to let it fall the fuck apart
than cheat it of a past.

262
00:26:06,648 --> 00:26:07,704
It's not right, you know?

263
00:26:07,814 --> 00:26:11,644
To renovate the soul
right out of a place.

264
00:26:14,981 --> 00:26:18,708
You ever wish you could
just keep things

265
00:26:18,814 --> 00:26:20,712
exactly the way they were?

266
00:26:20,814 --> 00:26:25,246
That you could
just hold on to

267
00:26:25,347 --> 00:26:28,370
a moment in time
like it was...

268
00:26:35,380 --> 00:26:37,174
Fuck this.

269
00:26:38,446 --> 00:26:39,844
- I can't believe
this is happening.

270
00:26:39,947 --> 00:26:40,935
I can't believe it.

271
00:26:41,047 --> 00:26:42,103
- What part?

272
00:26:42,213 --> 00:26:43,372
What part
can't you believe?

273
00:26:43,479 --> 00:26:46,603
- I don't know,
all of it.

274
00:26:46,712 --> 00:26:48,974
- Hey, but---

275
00:26:49,079 --> 00:26:50,942
I'll have to go like this
from now on.

276
00:26:54,779 --> 00:26:56,574
- You believe how much
I love you, don't you?

277
00:26:56,679 --> 00:26:57,667
- Of course.

278
00:26:57,779 --> 00:27:00,836
- And you believe
how much l---

279
00:27:00,945 --> 00:27:02,003
I mean it,

280
00:27:02,111 --> 00:27:05,702
how much I just mean
everything I say, all of it.

281
00:27:05,811 --> 00:27:07,038
- Yes.

282
00:27:07,144 --> 00:27:10,838
Though not
everything, everything.

283
00:27:12,544 --> 00:27:15,204
Hey, I didn't mean
it like that.

284
00:27:17,843 --> 00:27:18,901
Hey, forget about it.

285
00:27:19,010 --> 00:27:20,566
I didn't mean it in a bad way.

286
00:27:20,677 --> 00:27:24,404
- I know.

287
00:27:24,510 --> 00:27:30,568
I only get like that
when I'm scared, you know.

288
00:27:30,677 --> 00:27:34,268
I only talk like that
when I'm scared.

289
00:27:34,376 --> 00:27:37,705
- I get scared too, Terry.

290
00:27:37,809 --> 00:27:39,036
We all get scared.

291
00:27:39,143 --> 00:27:41,132
- Are you scared of me?

292
00:27:41,243 --> 00:27:42,230
- No.

293
00:27:42,342 --> 00:27:44,309
No, no, no.

294
00:27:44,410 --> 00:27:48,035
I get scared of us, though.

295
00:27:48,142 --> 00:27:49,131
- Scared of us?

296
00:27:49,243 --> 00:27:50,502
- Yeah.

297
00:27:50,608 --> 00:27:54,042
Too powerful sometimes.

298
00:27:54,142 --> 00:27:55,732
- Hey.

299
00:27:55,841 --> 00:27:57,467
- Yeah?

300
00:27:57,576 --> 00:27:59,507
- I don't want you
scared of me.

301
00:27:59,608 --> 00:28:01,597
I don't ever want
to do anything

302
00:28:01,708 --> 00:28:03,765
or say anything,
hurt you.

303
00:28:03,874 --> 00:28:07,601
- Shh.

304
00:28:07,707 --> 00:28:09,139
I'm here.

305
00:28:09,241 --> 00:28:13,866
I'm right here.

306
00:28:13,974 --> 00:28:16,201
She said yes.

307
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:20,628
Yes, she did,
didn't she?

308
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:22,797
- Yes, she did.
- Yeah.

309
00:28:22,907 --> 00:28:24,237
- She yelled it.

310
00:28:27,907 --> 00:28:29,133
I can't believe you.

311
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:32,228
Shit.

312
00:28:32,340 --> 00:28:34,328
- What?

313
00:28:34,439 --> 00:28:35,962
- I got to call Jules.

314
00:28:36,073 --> 00:28:37,061
- No, can't---

315
00:28:37,173 --> 00:28:39,138
Why don't we just
enjoy this alone?

316
00:28:39,239 --> 00:28:40,637
- We got to celebrate,
don't we?

317
00:28:40,739 --> 00:28:42,795
No?

318
00:28:42,905 --> 00:28:45,394
- Just tonight,
just the two of us.

319
00:28:45,506 --> 00:28:46,937
- Baby, it's Jules.

320
00:28:47,039 --> 00:28:48,471
- I know.
- I got to tell him.

321
00:28:48,573 --> 00:28:49,630
- Hello.

322
00:28:49,739 --> 00:28:51,863
- Julian, hey.

323
00:28:51,972 --> 00:28:53,961
- Terry?
What time is it?

324
00:28:54,072 --> 00:28:56,333
- No, I have no idea.

325
00:28:56,438 --> 00:28:57,495
We've been up all night.

326
00:28:57,605 --> 00:28:59,093
Listen, man, um...

327
00:29:01,305 --> 00:29:03,497
We're getting married.

328
00:29:03,604 --> 00:29:04,968
- Wow.

329
00:29:05,071 --> 00:29:06,662
So you guys are still---

330
00:29:08,103 --> 00:29:09,694
- Still?

331
00:29:09,804 --> 00:29:13,201
No, not still.

332
00:29:14,871 --> 00:29:17,859
Actually, Jules---

333
00:29:17,970 --> 00:29:25,164
Actually, I had to stop by
your place for a minute.

334
00:29:25,269 --> 00:29:26,792
- Wait, you were here?

335
00:29:26,903 --> 00:29:29,425
Why?

336
00:29:29,536 --> 00:29:30,661
- Just listen, man, all right?

337
00:29:30,770 --> 00:29:32,759
Just listen.

338
00:29:32,870 --> 00:29:34,960
I was gonna leave a note
so they'd know

339
00:29:35,069 --> 00:29:38,092
you were free from blame
or whatever.

340
00:29:38,203 --> 00:29:39,725
- What?

341
00:29:39,835 --> 00:29:41,131
Terry, what are you
talking about?

342
00:29:41,236 --> 00:29:42,599
I don't even know
what you're saying.

343
00:29:42,702 --> 00:29:44,998
- I had to---

344
00:29:45,102 --> 00:29:47,192
I had to borrow something.

345
00:29:47,302 --> 00:29:48,563
- What?

346
00:29:48,669 --> 00:29:49,657
Terry, what?

347
00:29:49,769 --> 00:29:51,029
- I only came to talk, man.

348
00:29:51,135 --> 00:29:54,226
It's not like I planned---

349
00:29:54,335 --> 00:29:55,322
I don't know---

350
00:29:55,434 --> 00:29:56,866
- Okay, fine, so then
we're talking now, right?

351
00:29:56,968 --> 00:30:00,456
- It's too late for that,
Jules, all right?

352
00:30:00,568 --> 00:30:02,693
- Terry, it's not
too fucking late.

353
00:30:02,801 --> 00:30:04,460
Come on, man.

354
00:30:08,301 --> 00:30:12,289
- I know you keep the---the---
the bullets hidden,

355
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:15,958
so I had to go buy some.

356
00:30:16,067 --> 00:30:17,532
Not even sure
I got the right size.

357
00:30:17,633 --> 00:30:20,065
I mean, do different handguns
take different bullets?

358
00:30:20,167 --> 00:30:21,757
I don't know.
- Terry.

359
00:30:21,866 --> 00:30:24,355
- I only know what I've seen
on Law and Order.

360
00:30:24,466 --> 00:30:25,454
- Okay, hang on.

361
00:30:25,566 --> 00:30:26,827
- I don't watch CSI.

362
00:30:26,933 --> 00:30:30,195
- Hold it.
You have my gun?

363
00:30:30,300 --> 00:30:31,357
- Yeah, I'm sorry.

364
00:30:31,466 --> 00:30:33,125
- Terry, you stole my gun?

365
00:30:34,532 --> 00:30:35,520
- Dude, I'm sorry.

366
00:30:35,632 --> 00:30:37,531
- That's a fucking
shitty thing to do, man.

367
00:30:37,631 --> 00:30:40,223
- Yeah, I hear you, man.

368
00:30:40,332 --> 00:30:42,025
- Okay, Terry,
what are you going to do?

369
00:30:42,132 --> 00:30:44,428
Are you going to shoot him?

370
00:30:44,532 --> 00:30:45,520
- I might.

371
00:30:45,632 --> 00:30:49,086
- Okay, you're gonna kill him?

372
00:30:49,199 --> 00:30:51,687
- I might, yeah.

373
00:30:51,798 --> 00:30:54,390
- What, you want
fucking Jerry Orbach,

374
00:30:54,499 --> 00:30:55,793
fucking the other guy,

375
00:30:55,897 --> 00:30:56,988
whatever the fuck
his name is,

376
00:30:57,097 --> 00:30:58,086
you want them coming
through your door,

377
00:30:58,198 --> 00:30:59,186
hauling your ass
off to jail?

378
00:30:59,298 --> 00:31:01,787
- What am I supposed
to do, Jules?

379
00:31:01,897 --> 00:31:03,227
- I could think
of a couple things.

380
00:31:03,331 --> 00:31:04,353
- You wouldn't let it go.

381
00:31:04,463 --> 00:31:05,895
- Wh-wh-what is that
supposed to mean?

382
00:31:05,997 --> 00:31:08,053
- You wouldn't let some girl
treat you like this.

383
00:31:08,163 --> 00:31:09,254
I mean,
that's what you said.

384
00:31:09,363 --> 00:31:11,421
- Yeah, but dude,
I never fucking said that

385
00:31:11,530 --> 00:31:12,553
with a gun in my hand,
Terry.

386
00:31:12,664 --> 00:31:14,152
- It doesn't matter now
anyway, man.

387
00:31:14,263 --> 00:31:15,456
- No, this does matter.

388
00:31:15,564 --> 00:31:16,551
Terry, you keep---

389
00:31:16,663 --> 00:31:17,651
You do this, man.

390
00:31:17,763 --> 00:31:19,195
How am I ever supposed
to trust you?

391
00:31:19,297 --> 00:31:21,524
You keep pulling
this bullshit.

392
00:31:21,629 --> 00:31:23,152
I mean, this shit
is in your head, Terry.

393
00:31:23,263 --> 00:31:26,092
You keep---
you put it on me,

394
00:31:26,196 --> 00:31:28,492
and then you
put it back on her.

395
00:31:37,296 --> 00:31:39,262
Terry.

396
00:31:43,295 --> 00:31:44,818
Terry, come on, man.

397
00:31:44,929 --> 00:31:46,689
Listen to me, all right?

398
00:31:46,794 --> 00:31:48,761
You are just really
scaring me right now.

399
00:31:50,861 --> 00:31:53,350
- I'm not asking you
for anything more, Jules.

400
00:31:54,728 --> 00:31:55,818
This is it.

401
00:31:55,928 --> 00:31:57,485
No more phone calls,

402
00:31:57,594 --> 00:31:59,321
no more...

403
00:31:59,427 --> 00:32:02,223
jobs.

404
00:32:02,328 --> 00:32:03,815
It's the last time.

405
00:32:06,761 --> 00:32:08,919
I promise.

406
00:32:11,861 --> 00:32:14,224
- Terry, where are you?

407
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:21,323
- I'm at the Riverview.

408
00:32:21,426 --> 00:32:23,915
Across the hall
from them.

409
00:32:26,759 --> 00:32:28,783
- You're not.

410
00:32:32,859 --> 00:32:34,620
- I am.

411
00:32:38,192 --> 00:32:39,590
- You're across the hall.

412
00:32:39,692 --> 00:32:41,351
- Room 508.

413
00:32:41,458 --> 00:32:45,254
Nonsmoking.

414
00:32:45,358 --> 00:32:47,653
Check out at noon.

415
00:32:59,058 --> 00:33:03,819
Gonna smoke this cigarette

416
00:33:03,924 --> 00:33:08,583
and then, you know...

417
00:33:08,690 --> 00:33:09,678
head on over there.

418
00:33:11,224 --> 00:33:13,280
- All right, um...

419
00:33:13,390 --> 00:33:14,378
Fuck, how about this?

420
00:33:14,490 --> 00:33:16,580
How about---what if l---

421
00:33:16,689 --> 00:33:19,417
what if I met you there?

422
00:33:21,189 --> 00:33:23,247
- Here?

423
00:33:23,356 --> 00:33:24,844
At the hotel?

424
00:33:24,956 --> 00:33:28,116
Yeah, dude, I could
be there in, like---

425
00:33:28,223 --> 00:33:30,279
I mean, I can be there
in, like, 20 minutes.

426
00:33:30,389 --> 00:33:32,617
You give me---
give me 20 minutes.

427
00:33:32,722 --> 00:33:34,550
But listen, man, you have to
sit tight, all right?

428
00:33:34,655 --> 00:33:35,780
You have to promise me

429
00:33:35,888 --> 00:33:37,582
you're gonna put
that fucking gun away

430
00:33:37,689 --> 00:33:39,244
and that you're gonna sit tight,
all right?

431
00:33:39,354 --> 00:33:41,253
That's the deal.

432
00:33:45,788 --> 00:33:48,777
Terry, come on, man,
20 fucking minutes.

433
00:33:54,688 --> 00:33:55,983
- 20 minutes, man.

434
00:33:56,087 --> 00:33:57,848
You got it.

435
00:33:57,954 --> 00:33:59,510
- All right,
20 minutes, good.

436
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:00,779
Listen, man,
I'm telling you.

437
00:34:00,887 --> 00:34:03,183
We're gonna be sharing
drinks in no time, man.

438
00:34:03,288 --> 00:34:04,912
We're gonna laugh
about this, all right?

439
00:34:06,387 --> 00:34:09,682
- Jules, man...

440
00:34:09,786 --> 00:34:11,753
what would I do
without you?

441
00:34:42,052 --> 00:34:43,539
- June.

442
00:34:43,651 --> 00:34:44,742
Hey.

443
00:34:44,851 --> 00:34:47,248
June.

444
00:34:47,350 --> 00:34:48,441
We got a problem.

445
00:35:09,416 --> 00:35:10,905
Hello?

446
00:35:11,017 --> 00:35:12,982
- Hey, it's me.

447
00:35:13,082 --> 00:35:16,344
- Hey, what's going on?

448
00:35:16,449 --> 00:35:17,436
I was wondering,

449
00:35:17,549 --> 00:35:19,539
are you free
to get together tonight?

450
00:35:19,650 --> 00:35:20,945
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

451
00:35:21,049 --> 00:35:22,140
No, I can do that.

452
00:35:22,248 --> 00:35:24,976
Is everything all right?

453
00:35:25,082 --> 00:35:26,741
- No, I'm fine.

454
00:35:26,849 --> 00:35:28,179
I'm here at this hotel.

455
00:35:28,282 --> 00:35:29,578
- The Riverview, you know?
- Right.

456
00:35:29,681 --> 00:35:31,909
- And I kind of needed to talk.
- Riverview.

457
00:35:32,015 --> 00:35:33,208
- Do you know how
to get here okay?

458
00:35:33,315 --> 00:35:34,302
- Yeah.
No, no, no.

459
00:35:34,414 --> 00:35:37,074
I-I know it well.

460
00:35:59,047 --> 00:36:00,672
Wow, Anna.

461
00:36:00,780 --> 00:36:03,008
- This is not
the third floor.

462
00:36:03,114 --> 00:36:05,705
- No, no, this is the lobby.

463
00:36:05,812 --> 00:36:07,210
- Floor?

464
00:36:07,313 --> 00:36:08,972
- Uh, 507---five.

465
00:36:26,344 --> 00:36:29,140
So you're back in town,
obviously.

466
00:36:29,245 --> 00:36:31,267
- Mm-hmm.

467
00:36:31,378 --> 00:36:33,810
Just for business.

468
00:36:33,912 --> 00:36:36,673
- Right.

469
00:36:36,778 --> 00:36:38,800
I didn't know you were
so sentimental, Anna.

470
00:36:41,077 --> 00:36:43,009
- You don't have to
flatter yourself, Julian.

471
00:36:43,111 --> 00:36:44,202
- I'm just saying---

472
00:36:44,311 --> 00:36:46,504
- Expense account isn't exactly
cut out for the Waldorf.

473
00:36:46,611 --> 00:36:49,633
I'm not staying here
for the memories.

474
00:36:58,010 --> 00:37:03,874
Did you know that the Ambassador
of Estonia stayed here?

475
00:37:03,976 --> 00:37:04,964
- I didn't know that.

476
00:37:06,809 --> 00:37:09,366
That's great.
- Mm-hmm.

477
00:37:09,476 --> 00:37:14,840
So what are you
doing here of all places?

478
00:37:14,942 --> 00:37:17,464
Or don't l
want to know?

479
00:37:17,575 --> 00:37:19,405
- Nothing,
I'm just seeing a friend.

480
00:37:19,509 --> 00:37:21,906
- Really?

481
00:37:22,009 --> 00:37:22,997
A friend.

482
00:37:23,109 --> 00:37:25,938
They just call you up
like room service now or what?

483
00:37:30,607 --> 00:37:32,005
- Hmm.

484
00:37:33,575 --> 00:37:35,870
- Well, it's nice to know I can
still make you uncomfortable.

485
00:37:35,974 --> 00:37:38,406
- I'm sorry.

486
00:37:38,508 --> 00:37:41,803
This is really strange, just---

487
00:37:41,908 --> 00:37:45,203
you know, just seeing you
here of all places.

488
00:37:56,072 --> 00:37:58,800
- Julian, whatever you're
going up there to do, we could---

489
00:37:58,907 --> 00:37:59,895
- Anna.

490
00:38:47,970 --> 00:38:50,731
- Hey.
- Hey.

491
00:38:55,470 --> 00:38:56,458
- Listen, we got
a problem.

492
00:38:56,569 --> 00:38:57,593
- What?

493
00:38:57,702 --> 00:39:00,259
- Terry is here.

494
00:39:00,369 --> 00:39:02,359
He's here at the hotel.

495
00:39:02,470 --> 00:39:03,901
- What? How?

496
00:39:04,003 --> 00:39:05,127
- I don't know.

497
00:39:05,235 --> 00:39:07,134
He said he followed you here.

498
00:39:07,236 --> 00:39:09,326
- Oh, my God.

499
00:39:09,435 --> 00:39:10,924
- Does he know
it's both of us?

500
00:39:11,035 --> 00:39:12,501
- He knows about you.

501
00:39:13,568 --> 00:39:14,557
- Oh, God.

502
00:39:20,935 --> 00:39:22,901
- What---what are you doing?

503
00:39:23,002 --> 00:39:24,490
- My phone.

504
00:39:24,601 --> 00:39:26,998
I need to find
my phone.

505
00:39:27,101 --> 00:39:28,089
I need my phone.

506
00:39:28,201 --> 00:39:29,963
I need to talk to him.
- No.

507
00:39:30,068 --> 00:39:33,431
No, you cannot call him.
- Why not?

508
00:39:35,067 --> 00:39:36,726
- Because he's got a gun.

509
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:41,189
- He's got a gun?

510
00:39:41,300 --> 00:39:43,857
- I don't know,
maybe he's got a gun?

511
00:39:43,966 --> 00:39:45,296
Probably he doesn't.

512
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:47,797
- Well, which is it?

513
00:39:51,766 --> 00:39:52,754
I don't know.

514
00:39:52,866 --> 00:39:55,923
Maybe---maybe he's got my gun.

515
00:39:56,032 --> 00:39:58,260
- Jules, you mean to tell me---

516
00:39:58,366 --> 00:39:59,889
- Stop, stop, stop, stop,
listen to me.

517
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,659
Listen to me,
you cannot say my name.

518
00:40:01,766 --> 00:40:05,163
Terry is directly
across the hall, okay?

519
00:40:05,266 --> 00:40:06,822
He's in the room
right across the hall.

520
00:40:06,932 --> 00:40:08,523
So we just need to relax.

521
00:40:08,633 --> 00:40:09,859
We can do this.

522
00:40:09,965 --> 00:40:10,953
Yeah?

523
00:40:11,065 --> 00:40:12,053
We can do this.

524
00:40:12,166 --> 00:40:13,222
It's Terry,
for God sakes.

525
00:41:05,962 --> 00:41:08,258
- Oh, shit.

526
00:41:17,562 --> 00:41:19,993
Of course you pick a room
on the fifth fucking floor.

527
00:41:26,394 --> 00:41:27,950
- Got to call the police.

528
00:41:28,060 --> 00:41:29,048
- Shit.

529
00:41:29,161 --> 00:41:30,558
Fuck.

530
00:41:30,660 --> 00:41:32,320
What are you doing?

531
00:41:32,427 --> 00:41:33,518
- I'm getting dressed.

532
00:41:33,628 --> 00:41:35,650
- Yeah, yeah,
that's a good idea.

533
00:41:47,260 --> 00:41:48,885
- Hey.
- Yeah.

534
00:41:48,993 --> 00:41:50,220
- Hey, what the fuck
are you doing?

535
00:41:50,326 --> 00:41:51,314
- I'm calling the police.

536
00:41:51,426 --> 00:41:52,413
- No, no, no, no, no.

537
00:41:52,526 --> 00:41:53,514
Listen to me.
Listen to me.

538
00:41:53,626 --> 00:41:55,388
No.
No police.

539
00:41:55,493 --> 00:41:56,957
- Why not?

540
00:41:57,058 --> 00:41:59,422
- We call the police,
they will know everything.

541
00:41:59,526 --> 00:42:02,390
They will know about us,
and he will know it's me.

542
00:42:43,823 --> 00:42:45,379
Shit.

543
00:42:45,489 --> 00:42:46,887
All right, this is him.
This is him.

544
00:42:46,990 --> 00:42:47,977
Listen, let me talk to him.

545
00:42:48,089 --> 00:42:49,077
Okay, let me talk to him.

546
00:42:49,189 --> 00:42:50,177
I can talk to him, okay?

547
00:42:50,289 --> 00:42:51,448
- Let me try.
- Shh.

548
00:42:51,556 --> 00:42:52,544
Terry?

549
00:42:52,655 --> 00:42:53,644
What's going on, man?

550
00:42:53,756 --> 00:42:54,744
- Tell him---

551
00:42:54,856 --> 00:42:57,378
- Do I look like
I'm ordering Chinese?

552
00:42:57,488 --> 00:42:59,148
Sorry, man.

553
00:42:59,256 --> 00:43:01,278
- Hey, Jules,
where are you, man?

554
00:43:05,954 --> 00:43:07,545
I'm right here, Terry, man,
I'm right here.

555
00:43:07,655 --> 00:43:09,121
- You got to get here, man.

556
00:43:09,222 --> 00:43:10,811
- Why, Ter?

557
00:43:10,921 --> 00:43:12,478
- You're gonna miss everything.

558
00:43:16,488 --> 00:43:19,010
- What are you talking
about, Terry, huh?

559
00:43:19,121 --> 00:43:21,053
What am I gonna miss?

560
00:43:21,155 --> 00:43:23,416
- The big show.

561
00:43:23,521 --> 00:43:25,783
It's about to start.

562
00:43:27,020 --> 00:43:29,213
- Fuck.

563
00:43:29,320 --> 00:43:32,252
Shit.

564
00:43:32,354 --> 00:43:33,819
Terry, what the fuck
is going on, man?

565
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:36,045
- Room service.

566
00:43:36,154 --> 00:43:39,143
- I sent her over
a surprise, man.

567
00:43:41,319 --> 00:43:42,751
Let her know I didn't forget.

568
00:43:44,653 --> 00:43:46,516
I could never forget.

569
00:43:44,653 --> 00:43:46,516
I could never forget.

570
00:43:51,019 --> 00:43:52,541
Listen, you have
to get that.

571
00:43:52,652 --> 00:43:54,243
- No.
- You have to get that.

572
00:43:54,352 --> 00:43:56,376
June, June, listen to me.
- I'm not going over there.

573
00:43:56,486 --> 00:43:57,815
- We just need to
buy some more time.

574
00:43:57,919 --> 00:43:59,214
Terry wants to get
talked out of it.

575
00:43:59,318 --> 00:44:00,307
- It's on mute.

576
00:44:00,418 --> 00:44:01,509
Terry wants to be
talked out of this,

577
00:44:01,618 --> 00:44:02,914
but you have
to buy some time, okay?

578
00:44:03,018 --> 00:44:04,416
I need you to play along.
Just play along, please.

579
00:44:06,751 --> 00:44:08,183
- Room service.

580
00:44:09,285 --> 00:44:10,272
- Listen to me.

581
00:44:10,384 --> 00:44:11,941
The guy at the door.
- Yeah.

582
00:44:12,051 --> 00:44:13,574
- That guy
is the porter, okay?

583
00:44:13,685 --> 00:44:14,809
I just need you
to talk to him.

584
00:44:14,918 --> 00:44:15,906
Can you do that
for me?

585
00:44:16,018 --> 00:44:17,608
I will keep Terry on the phone,
I promise you.

586
00:44:17,718 --> 00:44:18,705
I'll keep him talking.

587
00:44:18,817 --> 00:44:19,805
I'll be right here for you.

588
00:44:19,917 --> 00:44:20,906
I'll be right in that room.

589
00:44:21,017 --> 00:44:22,006
Can you do that?

590
00:44:22,118 --> 00:44:23,480
- Get in the room
and shut the door.

591
00:44:23,583 --> 00:44:24,879
- You can do this.

592
00:44:24,984 --> 00:44:26,779
- Keep him on the phone.

593
00:44:30,884 --> 00:44:32,679
- Julian?
Jules?

594
00:44:32,783 --> 00:44:33,771
- Yeah, Terry.

595
00:44:33,884 --> 00:44:34,872
Terry, I am here, man.

596
00:44:34,984 --> 00:44:35,971
I'm here.
Is everything okay?

597
00:44:36,083 --> 00:44:37,606
- They're not answering
the door, man.

598
00:44:37,717 --> 00:44:39,115
Why ain't they
answering the door?

599
00:44:39,216 --> 00:44:40,204
Terry, you need
to calm the fuck down,

600
00:44:40,316 --> 00:44:41,304
do you hear me?

601
00:44:41,416 --> 00:44:43,712
- I got to get a look
at the son of a bitch.

602
00:44:43,817 --> 00:44:44,804
I got to see this guy.

603
00:44:44,916 --> 00:44:46,438
- No, no, no, Terry,
you stop, stop.

604
00:44:46,549 --> 00:44:47,845
Terry, you get
away from that door.

605
00:44:47,949 --> 00:44:48,936
Do you hear me?

606
00:44:49,048 --> 00:44:53,378
- I don't know, Jules.

607
00:44:53,482 --> 00:44:55,141
I think maybe I'm gonna
shoot someone.

608
00:44:55,249 --> 00:44:56,839
- Come on, man,
you fucking promised me.

609
00:44:56,948 --> 00:44:59,540
- Christ.

610
00:45:04,748 --> 00:45:06,941
- Come on out, you fucker.

611
00:45:11,648 --> 00:45:12,807
- Hello?

612
00:45:12,915 --> 00:45:14,777
- I'm sorry
to disturb you, miss.

613
00:45:14,881 --> 00:45:18,177
But...

614
00:45:18,280 --> 00:45:20,213
Chilled.

615
00:45:20,314 --> 00:45:24,109
- Terry.

616
00:45:24,213 --> 00:45:25,201
- So beautiful.

617
00:45:25,313 --> 00:45:26,302
- Terry?

618
00:45:26,413 --> 00:45:29,004
- I don't think
we ordered that.

619
00:45:29,113 --> 00:45:31,704
- It's already been
paid for, miss.

620
00:45:31,813 --> 00:45:34,279
You need only
sign for it.

621
00:45:34,380 --> 00:45:36,971
- Sign for it.

622
00:45:37,080 --> 00:45:38,171
- Yes, miss.

623
00:45:38,280 --> 00:45:40,404
- Okay, Terry, Terry, Terry,
listen to me.

624
00:45:40,513 --> 00:45:41,809
Here's what
we're gonna do, man.

625
00:45:41,913 --> 00:45:43,311
I want you to get
out of that room.

626
00:45:43,412 --> 00:45:44,503
I want you to
go downstairs,

627
00:45:44,612 --> 00:45:47,340
and I want you to wait
for me in the lobby, all right?

628
00:45:47,446 --> 00:45:49,207
I'm a couple minutes away.

629
00:45:49,312 --> 00:45:50,971
I-I'll get there, man,

630
00:45:51,079 --> 00:45:53,544
and we will get
the hell out of there

631
00:45:53,645 --> 00:45:56,305
and go get ourselves some
real drinks, all right?

632
00:45:57,878 --> 00:46:00,310
Terry, come on, man,
listen to me.

633
00:46:00,411 --> 00:46:02,343
- Just tell me
what I did wrong.

634
00:46:02,445 --> 00:46:05,275
- Terry, you didn't
do anything wrong, man.

635
00:46:05,378 --> 00:46:06,843
You didn't do
anything wrong, okay?

636
00:46:06,944 --> 00:46:08,240
Everything is fine.

637
00:46:11,178 --> 00:46:12,303
- Why'd she stop loving me?

638
00:46:12,410 --> 00:46:14,069
- Fuck.
Come on, man, Terry.

639
00:46:14,177 --> 00:46:16,143
Snap the fuck out of it, man.
Don't do this.

640
00:46:18,145 --> 00:46:20,303
- It's one of
our finest bottles.

641
00:46:22,110 --> 00:46:24,632
A very good vintage.

642
00:46:26,277 --> 00:46:29,175
We try to serve
only the best

643
00:46:29,277 --> 00:46:30,902
here at the Riverview.

644
00:46:34,243 --> 00:46:36,471
- Terry.

645
00:46:38,343 --> 00:46:39,899
Fuck.

646
00:46:41,642 --> 00:46:43,199
- I hope that you're
happy with your tip.

647
00:46:43,309 --> 00:46:45,297
- Thank you, miss.

648
00:46:45,408 --> 00:46:46,601
But I don't do it for the...

649
00:46:48,875 --> 00:46:50,705
tips.

650
00:47:34,440 --> 00:47:36,928
- Okay.

651
00:47:37,039 --> 00:47:38,834
Okay.

652
00:47:58,238 --> 00:48:01,364
Put that on.

653
00:48:01,470 --> 00:48:02,868
Come on, Terry.
Come on, Terry.

654
00:48:23,369 --> 00:48:24,358
- Hello?

655
00:48:24,469 --> 00:48:25,662
- All right, now.

656
00:48:25,769 --> 00:48:27,530
Go, go, go, go.

657
00:50:39,129 --> 00:50:40,788
- Come on.

658
00:50:40,895 --> 00:50:43,952
Answer the phone, Jules.

659
00:50:44,062 --> 00:50:45,049
Come on.

660
00:50:45,161 --> 00:50:47,593
Come on, Jules.

661
00:52:12,756 --> 00:52:15,153
- Hey. Hey.

662
00:52:15,256 --> 00:52:16,347
You got to get out
of the hall.

663
00:52:16,456 --> 00:52:17,444
- Come here.
- Sorry?

664
00:52:17,556 --> 00:52:18,544
- You have to
get out of the hall.

665
00:52:18,656 --> 00:52:19,746
It's not safe here.

666
00:52:28,288 --> 00:52:30,152
- 302.

667
00:52:38,555 --> 00:52:39,680
Anna.

668
00:52:39,789 --> 00:52:41,515
- What is this?

669
00:52:41,621 --> 00:52:43,053
- It's just---
it's not safe, okay?

670
00:52:43,155 --> 00:52:44,143
Just trust me.

671
00:52:44,255 --> 00:52:45,277
- Let go of my hand.

672
00:52:45,387 --> 00:52:47,410
- Come on.
- Let go of me.

673
00:52:47,521 --> 00:52:48,680
Hey.

674
00:52:48,788 --> 00:52:51,083
- Anna.

675
00:52:53,221 --> 00:52:54,209
- Julian?

676
00:52:54,321 --> 00:52:55,582
Are you here by yourself?

677
00:52:55,687 --> 00:52:56,880
- Julian, what are you doing?

678
00:52:56,987 --> 00:53:00,317
- Do you have a boyfriend
or somebody here with you?

679
00:53:00,421 --> 00:53:02,409
- No, I told you,
I'm here on business.

680
00:53:03,620 --> 00:53:04,643
Julian.

681
00:53:04,753 --> 00:53:05,980
- And you haven't
left the room?

682
00:53:06,087 --> 00:53:07,074
- No.

683
00:53:07,186 --> 00:53:08,880
Julian, what is wrong?
- Sit down, sit down.

684
00:53:08,986 --> 00:53:11,543
Listen to me, please.

685
00:53:11,652 --> 00:53:13,482
I need your help, okay?

686
00:53:13,587 --> 00:53:16,780
I need us to be
together right now.

687
00:53:19,053 --> 00:53:20,040
- Just like that?

688
00:53:20,152 --> 00:53:21,379
- No, no, no, no,
I don't mean that.

689
00:53:21,486 --> 00:53:22,816
I just mean if someone
were to ask,

690
00:53:22,919 --> 00:53:26,544
I just need you to say
that we were together tonight.

691
00:53:26,652 --> 00:53:28,810
- Well, Julian,
who would be asking?

692
00:53:28,918 --> 00:53:30,111
- Anna, nobody's asking.

693
00:53:30,219 --> 00:53:32,377
I'm just saying
that if someone were to ask,

694
00:53:32,485 --> 00:53:35,509
that you would tell them
we were together tonight.

695
00:53:35,618 --> 00:53:36,810
But not here;,
it can't be here.

696
00:53:36,917 --> 00:53:38,383
It's got to be
someplace else, you know?

697
00:53:38,485 --> 00:53:39,473
Like my place.

698
00:53:39,585 --> 00:53:41,050
- Julian, you're not
making any sense.

699
00:53:41,151 --> 00:53:42,515
Listen, what---

700
00:53:42,618 --> 00:53:44,811
- Okay, Listen,
listen, listen, listen.

701
00:53:44,918 --> 00:53:47,213
I fucked up, okay?

702
00:53:47,318 --> 00:53:48,306
I fucked up bad.

703
00:53:48,418 --> 00:53:51,145
You were right.

704
00:53:51,251 --> 00:53:55,546
- Right about what?

705
00:53:55,650 --> 00:53:58,877
- I should have gotten off
the elevator with you.

706
00:53:58,983 --> 00:54:00,643
I mean, I never should've been
on the elevator

707
00:54:00,750 --> 00:54:01,738
in the first place.

708
00:54:01,851 --> 00:54:02,838
- Oh, and what then?

709
00:54:02,950 --> 00:54:04,541
- Listen to me.
I can explain this.

710
00:54:04,649 --> 00:54:06,081
I promise
I can explain everything,

711
00:54:06,183 --> 00:54:07,170
and I will.

712
00:54:07,282 --> 00:54:08,612
I will explain
everything to you.

713
00:54:08,716 --> 00:54:12,148
But I just need you
to do this for me, please.

714
00:54:12,249 --> 00:54:15,840
Hey.
Will you do that for me?

715
00:54:15,949 --> 00:54:17,813
- All right.
- Yeah?

716
00:54:17,916 --> 00:54:19,075
All right.

717
00:54:19,182 --> 00:54:20,239
Thank you.

718
00:54:20,349 --> 00:54:21,372
Come here,
come here.

719
00:54:21,483 --> 00:54:23,540
Come here.

720
00:54:23,649 --> 00:54:25,773
I'm sorry.

721
00:54:29,682 --> 00:54:31,511
What?

722
00:54:31,615 --> 00:54:32,671
- Who are you here with?

723
00:54:34,181 --> 00:54:35,704
- Anna, come on,
don't do this.

724
00:54:35,815 --> 00:54:39,837
- Do I know her?

725
00:54:39,948 --> 00:54:42,005
Is it June?

726
00:54:45,248 --> 00:54:46,235
Julian.

727
00:54:46,347 --> 00:54:47,506
- Anna, listen to me.

728
00:54:47,614 --> 00:54:48,602
She called, okay?

729
00:54:48,714 --> 00:54:49,701
- Of all the places...

730
00:54:49,813 --> 00:54:50,801
- No, no, no, listen.

731
00:54:50,913 --> 00:54:52,470
- You could go,
you had to bring her here?

732
00:54:52,581 --> 00:54:53,638
- You don't understand, okay?

733
00:54:53,747 --> 00:54:55,575
- You son of a bitch.
- You don't understand.

734
00:54:55,680 --> 00:54:58,373
- You're fucking your
best friend's girlfriend,

735
00:54:58,480 --> 00:54:59,878
and now you are asking
for my help?

736
00:54:59,980 --> 00:55:00,968
- That is not what happened.

737
00:55:01,080 --> 00:55:02,511
- Julian, get the fuck
out of my room.

738
00:55:02,613 --> 00:55:04,135
- I just need you
to trust me on this.

739
00:55:04,246 --> 00:55:06,213
- Julian, I can smell her
all over you.

740
00:55:08,346 --> 00:55:10,278
Get out.
- Anna.

741
00:55:16,212 --> 00:55:18,372
Anna, come on.

742
00:55:40,845 --> 00:55:43,538
- Terry, what are you doing?

743
00:55:43,644 --> 00:55:44,735
- I'm gonna show you, June.

744
00:56:06,844 --> 00:56:07,831
Do you love him?

745
00:56:07,943 --> 00:56:09,932
- Terry, what are you doing?

746
00:56:10,043 --> 00:56:12,372
- Do you fucking love him?

747
00:56:12,476 --> 00:56:13,601
- Terry, Terry, Terry.

748
00:56:13,709 --> 00:56:15,039
This guy has nothing
to do with it.

749
00:56:15,143 --> 00:56:17,165
- Look, don't do that
to me, June.

750
00:56:17,275 --> 00:56:18,605
All right?

751
00:56:18,709 --> 00:56:21,266
Don't you fucking stand there
and keep on lying to me.

752
00:56:21,375 --> 00:56:22,363
- I'm not lying.

753
00:56:22,476 --> 00:56:24,032
It's not---
It's not him.

754
00:56:27,509 --> 00:56:29,167
- Finally got one.

755
00:56:39,774 --> 00:56:43,172
- Ah!

756
00:56:43,273 --> 00:56:45,637
- Hey, want to
turn that thing off for me?

757
00:56:47,640 --> 00:56:48,731
- Oh.

758
00:56:50,307 --> 00:56:51,295
- Listen to me, please.

759
00:56:51,407 --> 00:56:52,532
I have to tell you the truth.

760
00:56:52,640 --> 00:56:54,400
- The truth?

761
00:56:54,506 --> 00:56:57,200
June.

762
00:56:57,307 --> 00:56:58,398
It's right here
in front of us.

763
00:56:58,506 --> 00:57:00,734
- He didn't do
anything wrong.

764
00:57:00,840 --> 00:57:02,669
- It's right here
in front of us,

765
00:57:02,772 --> 00:57:03,863
right here to see.

766
00:57:07,672 --> 00:57:11,536
- All right,
she'll be all right.

767
00:57:11,638 --> 00:57:14,230
As long as he doesn't see me,
they should be all right.

768
00:57:14,339 --> 00:57:15,702
I'm gonna call Julian.

769
00:57:15,805 --> 00:57:17,703
- Terry, just forget
about Julian for once

770
00:57:17,805 --> 00:57:18,793
and listen to me.

771
00:57:24,871 --> 00:57:27,599
Terry.

772
00:57:27,705 --> 00:57:28,727
- June.

773
00:57:28,838 --> 00:57:30,270
- Terry.
- June.

774
00:57:41,903 --> 00:57:44,369
- Shit!

775
00:57:45,736 --> 00:57:46,861
Fuck me.

776
00:57:59,569 --> 00:58:00,796
- June.

777
00:58:08,168 --> 00:58:09,759
Shit, June.

778
00:58:55,166 --> 00:58:57,223
- Hi.

779
00:58:57,333 --> 00:58:59,628
- Hey.

780
00:59:03,199 --> 00:59:06,723
- You all right?

781
00:59:06,833 --> 00:59:08,991
- Yeah.

782
00:59:12,065 --> 00:59:14,054
- What?

783
00:59:19,531 --> 00:59:21,724
- I do love him.

784
00:59:26,598 --> 00:59:27,586
- Yeah.

785
00:59:27,698 --> 00:59:31,095
So do l.

786
00:59:31,198 --> 00:59:33,220
- He just---

787
00:59:33,330 --> 00:59:37,093
he can be so sure, you know?

788
00:59:37,198 --> 00:59:39,857
About everything.

789
00:59:39,964 --> 00:59:41,758
I'm not like that.

790
00:59:41,863 --> 00:59:45,796
I just---

791
00:59:45,897 --> 00:59:47,226
I wanted to make sure

792
00:59:47,329 --> 00:59:53,160
that it was my love
that I was feeling.

793
00:59:53,263 --> 00:59:55,421
You know?

794
00:59:55,529 --> 01:00:00,154
Not---not just his love.

795
01:00:00,262 --> 01:00:02,785
- It's all right.

796
01:00:02,896 --> 01:00:05,293
- Yeah.

797
01:00:05,396 --> 01:00:08,088
Mmm.

798
01:00:11,761 --> 01:00:14,023
I do love him.

799
01:00:17,694 --> 01:00:19,627
- I know.

800
01:01:05,592 --> 01:01:09,649
- Hotel Riverview.

801
01:01:09,758 --> 01:01:10,985
No.

802
01:01:11,092 --> 01:01:12,216
No, ma'am,
I can assure you,

803
01:01:12,324 --> 01:01:14,586
we haven't had
any gunfire here tonight.

804
01:01:17,925 --> 01:01:20,187
Have a good night.

805
01:01:20,292 --> 01:01:21,847
We're still getting
noise complaints.

806
01:01:21,957 --> 01:01:24,480
Son of a whore!

807
01:01:24,591 --> 01:01:25,578
Riverview.

808
01:01:28,591 --> 01:01:29,578
- Hmm.

809
01:01:29,690 --> 01:01:33,179
- Uh, soup?

810
01:02:11,322 --> 01:02:12,548
- I want to make him pay for it.

811
01:02:32,921 --> 01:02:34,476
- Holy shit.

812
01:02:34,586 --> 01:02:37,018
June?

813
01:02:37,120 --> 01:02:38,107
June.

814
01:02:38,219 --> 01:02:39,208
She's not moving.

815
01:02:39,319 --> 01:02:40,580
- Don't touch her.

816
01:02:40,686 --> 01:02:41,845
- Let me help her,
all right?

817
01:02:41,953 --> 01:02:43,816
- Not like this.
Not like this.

818
01:02:43,920 --> 01:02:44,908
No, man.

819
01:02:45,020 --> 01:02:46,780
- You've lost
your fucking mind, Terry.

820
01:02:46,885 --> 01:02:47,873
June!

821
01:02:47,985 --> 01:02:50,974
Terry!

822
01:02:51,086 --> 01:02:52,552
Does it look
as if I lost my mind?

823
01:03:18,717 --> 01:03:20,706
I'm gonna let you go now,
all right?

824
01:03:20,817 --> 01:03:21,805
I'm gonna let you go.

825
01:03:21,917 --> 01:03:23,349
You've got to listen to me.
Listen to me.

826
01:03:23,451 --> 01:03:24,542
You gonna listen?

827
01:03:32,184 --> 01:03:33,672
- Hello?

828
01:03:33,782 --> 01:03:35,043
Is everything okay?

829
01:03:38,882 --> 01:03:40,439
- Answer her.

830
01:03:43,216 --> 01:03:44,443
Answer her.

831
01:03:48,682 --> 01:03:51,170
- Yeah.

832
01:03:51,282 --> 01:03:52,373
Yeah, hold on.

833
01:04:01,348 --> 01:04:03,211
- You tell her
everything's fine.

834
01:04:03,315 --> 01:04:05,439
Wipe that off.

835
01:04:25,814 --> 01:04:27,245
- Is everything okay?

836
01:04:28,914 --> 01:04:30,436
- Yeah, it's fine.
Everything's fine.

837
01:04:30,547 --> 01:04:31,604
- I thought I heard---

838
01:04:31,713 --> 01:04:32,701
- Everything's fine.

839
01:04:32,814 --> 01:04:33,801
- But---

840
01:04:33,913 --> 01:04:36,345
- Please, we don't need
anything right now.

841
01:04:36,447 --> 01:04:37,435
Everything's---

842
01:04:37,547 --> 01:04:40,172
It's all right.

843
01:04:52,446 --> 01:04:56,172
- Who was it?

844
01:04:56,278 --> 01:04:58,904
- It was just the maid.

845
01:05:04,278 --> 01:05:06,039
We're fucked.

846
01:05:06,144 --> 01:05:07,303
- We're not fucked.

847
01:05:07,411 --> 01:05:09,138
- We are fucked, Terry.

848
01:05:09,244 --> 01:05:11,642
We're trapped in here, man.

849
01:05:11,745 --> 01:05:12,971
- I got everything planned,
Jules.

850
01:05:13,077 --> 01:05:14,509
I know what I'm doing.

851
01:05:14,610 --> 01:05:16,008
- Fuck.
You know what you're doing?

852
01:05:16,111 --> 01:05:17,406
That's bullshit.

853
01:05:17,510 --> 01:05:18,806
See, this is what
you always do.

854
01:05:18,911 --> 01:05:20,809
You see a straight road,
and you walk it crooked.

855
01:05:20,911 --> 01:05:21,898
- I walked straight over here.

856
01:05:22,010 --> 01:05:23,408
- What did you think
was gonna happen, huh?

857
01:05:23,510 --> 01:05:25,033
How did you think
this was gonna end?

858
01:05:25,144 --> 01:05:26,631
- You knew I had to come here.

859
01:05:26,743 --> 01:05:28,505
- What did I know?
- You knew about him.

860
01:05:28,610 --> 01:05:29,598
- Terry---

861
01:05:29,709 --> 01:05:32,607
- Don't.
Don't do that to me, man.

862
01:05:32,709 --> 01:05:33,868
Tell me the truth.

863
01:05:37,609 --> 01:05:40,666
Tell me how long
you've known about him.

864
01:06:25,872 --> 01:06:28,236
- 911, what's your emergency?

865
01:06:56,071 --> 01:06:57,560
- How did it happen?

866
01:07:05,538 --> 01:07:08,560
- You don't
have to know that, Jules.

867
01:07:08,670 --> 01:07:10,727
It's better if you don't.

868
01:07:14,004 --> 01:07:15,833
She tried to tell me
it wasn't him, but...

869
01:07:18,737 --> 01:07:20,067
I found them here together.

870
01:07:20,171 --> 01:07:23,364
- So, what, then you just---
you shot her?

871
01:07:30,002 --> 01:07:34,163
- No.

872
01:07:34,269 --> 01:07:37,201
I don't know, man, she was---

873
01:07:37,302 --> 01:07:38,291
It was fast, you know?

874
01:07:38,402 --> 01:07:44,301
She was here
and then, uh...

875
01:07:44,402 --> 01:07:47,561
it just happened,
you know?

876
01:07:47,668 --> 01:07:49,429
That's why
I needed your help.

877
01:07:49,535 --> 01:07:51,058
- I can't, man.

878
01:07:51,169 --> 01:07:55,192
Terry, I can't.

879
01:07:55,302 --> 01:07:56,289
I can't do this, man.

880
01:07:56,401 --> 01:07:58,390
Look at this, like,
look at this place.

881
01:08:02,867 --> 01:08:03,855
Even if---

882
01:08:03,967 --> 01:08:04,955
They'll find her.

883
01:08:05,067 --> 01:08:06,056
They'll know.

884
01:08:06,168 --> 01:08:11,828
- Yeah, who do you think
they're gonna suspect, huh?

885
01:08:23,266 --> 01:08:25,563
- Him?

886
01:08:25,666 --> 01:08:27,962
- Think about it.

887
01:08:28,066 --> 01:08:33,021
He was here with her all night.

888
01:08:33,132 --> 01:08:34,495
- Yeah.

889
01:08:34,598 --> 01:08:37,463
- Must've been
all over this place.

890
01:08:37,566 --> 01:08:39,326
And they---

891
01:08:39,432 --> 01:08:44,023
and they...

892
01:08:44,131 --> 01:08:47,155
must've slept together, right?

893
01:08:53,798 --> 01:08:54,786
- I don't know, Terry.

894
01:08:54,898 --> 01:08:55,885
I mean, I guess so.

895
01:08:55,997 --> 01:08:59,862
- So they'll know it was him.

896
01:09:02,931 --> 01:09:03,919
- I can't, man.

897
01:09:04,031 --> 01:09:06,860
I cannot frame
an innocent man.

898
01:09:06,963 --> 01:09:08,895
- Wait, innocent?

899
01:09:08,997 --> 01:09:10,190
You tell me
how he's innocent.

900
01:09:10,297 --> 01:09:11,524
- Okay, I didn't mean---

901
01:09:11,630 --> 01:09:12,619
- You know what?

902
01:09:12,731 --> 01:09:14,855
He's the one
who did this, Jules.

903
01:09:14,963 --> 01:09:16,054
He's the reason she's dead.

904
01:09:16,164 --> 01:09:17,629
- Okay, Terry, Terry, I know,
all right?

905
01:09:17,729 --> 01:09:18,718
But you can't---

906
01:09:18,830 --> 01:09:20,057
- Look, I need you
for this, man.

907
01:09:20,163 --> 01:09:21,255
- What are you doing?

908
01:09:21,363 --> 01:09:24,295
- I need you to help
make him pay for it.

909
01:09:33,762 --> 01:09:36,193
- Terry, come on, man,
what are you doing?

910
01:09:36,295 --> 01:09:38,284
- We're in this
together now, man.

911
01:09:51,262 --> 01:09:52,454
- What do you want
me to do, Terry?

912
01:09:52,561 --> 01:09:54,754
- What you came here for, Jules.

913
01:09:54,861 --> 01:09:55,985
- You want me to kill him?

914
01:09:56,094 --> 01:09:58,356
- You know everything
he took from me, man.

915
01:09:58,461 --> 01:10:00,824
He's the only one
who can prove anything, right?

916
01:10:00,927 --> 01:10:02,859
It's the only way,
believe me.

917
01:10:02,960 --> 01:10:03,948
- I believe you, Terry.

918
01:10:04,061 --> 01:10:05,287
- We could walk
out of here, Jules.

919
01:10:05,393 --> 01:10:07,689
We can make it look
like it was him all along.

920
01:10:21,160 --> 01:10:24,489
Come on, man,
pull the trigger.

921
01:10:26,892 --> 01:10:28,916
Pull the trigger.

922
01:10:30,060 --> 01:10:31,649
Pull the trigger.
- Terry, I can't do this.

923
01:10:31,758 --> 01:10:34,020
Hold the fucking gun
against his head,

924
01:10:34,125 --> 01:10:35,351
and you pull
the fucking trigger.

925
01:10:35,458 --> 01:10:36,446
- Terry, I can't fucking---

926
01:10:36,558 --> 01:10:37,547
- Get it over with, man.

927
01:10:37,658 --> 01:10:38,851
Do it for me.

928
01:10:38,957 --> 01:10:40,480
Pull the trigger.

929
01:10:43,358 --> 01:10:44,346
Julian.

930
01:10:44,458 --> 01:10:46,117
- Terry, I'm not gonna
fucking kill the guy.

931
01:10:46,224 --> 01:10:47,213
- Come on, Julian.

932
01:10:47,324 --> 01:10:49,222
- This is not my fault.

933
01:10:49,324 --> 01:10:50,415
- Get it over with,
Julian.

934
01:10:50,525 --> 01:10:51,990
- I'm not gonna kill
this guy, Terry.

935
01:10:54,458 --> 01:10:58,184
You fucking
did this, Terry.

936
01:10:58,290 --> 01:11:00,483
You killed her.

937
01:11:00,589 --> 01:11:01,987
And nothing
that we do to him

938
01:11:02,090 --> 01:11:04,148
is gonna
bring her back.

939
01:11:10,990 --> 01:11:12,581
- I know, man.

940
01:11:16,689 --> 01:11:17,847
I'm sorry.

941
01:11:24,556 --> 01:11:26,987
I'm sorry.

942
01:11:32,889 --> 01:11:37,548
Never should have called.

943
01:11:37,655 --> 01:11:39,677
Never should have---

944
01:11:39,788 --> 01:11:42,016
Never should have
called you down here.

945
01:11:42,121 --> 01:11:43,780
Never should have
let you see me like this.

946
01:11:51,121 --> 01:11:52,586
I just wanted
to get her back...

947
01:11:54,754 --> 01:11:57,242
wanted things
like they were.

948
01:12:00,853 --> 01:12:03,876
- Yeah, Terry, so did l.

949
01:12:08,254 --> 01:12:10,549
So did l.

950
01:12:16,319 --> 01:12:18,841
- Shit, man.

951
01:12:26,119 --> 01:12:27,106
- Listen, man.

952
01:12:27,218 --> 01:12:29,309
We're gonna, uh...

953
01:12:29,419 --> 01:12:31,850
We're gonna
figure this out, man.

954
01:12:42,185 --> 01:12:44,548
What if this
was an accident?

955
01:12:50,317 --> 01:12:53,373
You know, that's what
we could tell them.

956
01:12:55,151 --> 01:12:58,139
That you came here,

957
01:12:58,250 --> 01:13:01,239
and you didn't mean to do it.

958
01:13:01,350 --> 01:13:04,510
You found her here.

959
01:13:04,617 --> 01:13:07,048
You just
lost your head.

960
01:13:08,483 --> 01:13:10,345
Made a big mistake.

961
01:13:12,649 --> 01:13:15,410
- What do I say about you?

962
01:13:17,083 --> 01:13:19,378
- What about me?

963
01:13:19,482 --> 01:13:23,039
- I mean...

964
01:13:23,149 --> 01:13:24,774
don't we have to get
our stories straight?

965
01:13:24,882 --> 01:13:25,871
Right?

966
01:13:34,948 --> 01:13:36,538
When they find out
you were here---

967
01:13:36,648 --> 01:13:39,579
- Terry. Terry. Terry.

968
01:13:41,481 --> 01:13:43,878
They cannot know
that I was here.

969
01:13:48,247 --> 01:13:54,612
I think it's better
for both of us

970
01:13:54,714 --> 01:13:56,679
if they knew
that this was an accident.

971
01:14:13,080 --> 01:14:15,170
- Yeah.

972
01:14:15,279 --> 01:14:17,643
Yep.

973
01:14:17,746 --> 01:14:19,836
I'll tell them, man.
I'll tell them.

974
01:14:19,945 --> 01:14:21,309
I'll tell them
it was me.

975
01:14:21,413 --> 01:14:23,378
I'll tell them
I stole your gun,

976
01:14:23,478 --> 01:14:29,035
I came down here
on my own, l---

977
01:14:29,145 --> 01:14:30,236
He never got
a look at you.

978
01:14:32,278 --> 01:14:34,767
- No, he didn't, that's right.

979
01:14:37,011 --> 01:14:40,534
Hey.

980
01:14:40,644 --> 01:14:44,735
Hey.

981
01:14:44,843 --> 01:14:49,333
Are you sure about this?

982
01:14:49,443 --> 01:14:52,001
- I'm the only reason you're
even a part of this, man.

983
01:15:00,643 --> 01:15:02,632
The least I can do, right?

984
01:15:08,643 --> 01:15:12,131
- Terry, what are
you doing, man?

985
01:15:16,542 --> 01:15:18,235
Terry,
what are you doing?

986
01:15:32,574 --> 01:15:34,597
- Look at you, man.

987
01:15:38,174 --> 01:15:39,639
We've got to clean you up.

988
01:15:39,740 --> 01:15:41,729
- Shit.

989
01:15:41,840 --> 01:15:42,828
- Clean up the room.

990
01:15:47,640 --> 01:15:49,003
- Yeah.

991
01:15:53,240 --> 01:15:56,604
- Make sure they don't...

992
01:15:56,707 --> 01:16:00,934
find fingerprints on anything.

993
01:16:10,571 --> 01:16:12,003
There's a room,

994
01:16:12,105 --> 01:16:14,536
a-a janitor's closet.

995
01:16:14,638 --> 01:16:16,934
It's down the hall.

996
01:16:17,039 --> 01:16:19,334
- Terry.

997
01:16:22,804 --> 01:16:25,270
Come on, man, l---

998
01:16:25,371 --> 01:16:30,269
I can't let
anybody see me, you know?

999
01:16:30,371 --> 01:16:32,269
For this to work.

1000
01:16:38,204 --> 01:16:41,397
- Right.

1001
01:16:58,036 --> 01:17:00,060
- Hey, Terry?

1002
01:17:00,170 --> 01:17:01,294
Terry.

1003
01:17:05,403 --> 01:17:08,130
- I know, man.

1004
01:17:08,236 --> 01:17:10,428
I know.

1005
01:17:51,199 --> 01:17:53,290
- Terry.

1006
01:17:53,400 --> 01:17:54,388
- June.

1007
01:17:54,500 --> 01:17:57,124
June.

1008
01:18:05,433 --> 01:18:07,421
June.

1009
01:18:18,532 --> 01:18:21,463
Shit.

1010
01:18:21,564 --> 01:18:23,825
June.

1011
01:18:36,163 --> 01:18:38,255
Julian, come on,
answer, man.

1012
01:18:38,363 --> 01:18:39,352
Pick up.

1013
01:19:17,862 --> 01:19:19,157
- Hey, it's Julian.

1014
01:19:19,261 --> 01:19:20,886
Leave a message,

Julian.

Jules, it's me.

1029
01:20:46,789 --> 01:20:49,721
I've been trying
to reach you.

1030
01:20:49,822 --> 01:20:55,311
I couldn't
find you at home.

1031
01:20:55,422 --> 01:20:59,479
You got me worried.

1032
01:20:59,589 --> 01:21:01,282
Listen, man,

1033
01:21:01,389 --> 01:21:05,481
I know you've been
having a bad night, and...

1034
01:21:05,589 --> 01:21:07,315
whatever it is,

1035
01:21:07,421 --> 01:21:11,114
we can work it out.

1036
01:21:11,221 --> 01:21:14,052
I just don't want you
to end up hurting somebody.

1037
01:21:25,887 --> 01:21:28,375
- Terry?

1038
01:21:32,387 --> 01:21:34,683
Fuck.

1039
01:21:47,753 --> 01:21:48,946
- Come on, Julian.

1040
01:22:04,651 --> 01:22:06,083
- Oh, my God.

1041
01:22:06,185 --> 01:22:07,514
- I got everything planned,
Jules.

1042
01:22:07,618 --> 01:22:11,345
I know what I'm doing.

1043
01:22:11,450 --> 01:22:13,383
I know, man.

1044
01:22:13,485 --> 01:22:15,712
I know.

1045
01:22:20,384 --> 01:22:21,873
- Fuck.

1046
01:22:44,616 --> 01:22:46,445
- What, uh...

1047
01:22:46,548 --> 01:22:49,343
what happened?

1048
01:22:49,448 --> 01:22:53,846
- There was an accident.

1049
01:22:53,948 --> 01:22:55,039
Room 507.

1050
01:22:58,548 --> 01:23:02,411
- Accident?

1051
01:23:02,514 --> 01:23:05,845
- A murder, actually.

1052
01:23:08,781 --> 01:23:10,577
- Oh.

1053
01:23:13,048 --> 01:23:15,740
- I need you to do
something for me.

1054
01:23:15,847 --> 01:23:19,008
- l, um...

1055
01:23:19,115 --> 01:23:20,511
I can't.

1056
01:23:20,613 --> 01:23:22,705
- Don't worry.

1057
01:23:22,814 --> 01:23:26,177
They won't blame you.

1058
01:23:26,280 --> 01:23:27,870
- Blame me?

1059
01:23:27,979 --> 01:23:31,412
For what?

1060
01:23:31,513 --> 01:23:33,536
- For what happened.

1061
01:23:33,646 --> 01:23:37,305
- But I didn't have
anything to do with that.

1062
01:23:37,412 --> 01:23:38,401
- You let me in.

1063
01:23:38,513 --> 01:23:39,672
- I didn't know.

1064
01:23:39,780 --> 01:23:41,802
- You told me she was here.

1065
01:23:41,912 --> 01:23:43,468
You took my money.

1066
01:23:43,579 --> 01:23:47,034
- I didn't do it for the money.

1067
01:23:48,246 --> 01:23:50,302
- You really think
that's gonna matter to them?

1068
01:23:58,111 --> 01:24:01,942
But we understand each other,
don't we?

1069
01:25:38,872 --> 01:25:40,895
- Go, go, go, go!

1070
01:25:41,006 --> 01:25:42,699
- I got him.
I got him.

1071
01:25:42,805 --> 01:25:44,668
Drake, Madison,
get over here!

1072
01:25:44,772 --> 01:25:47,932
That stairway!
Move! Move! Go!

1073
01:25:51,338 --> 01:25:52,804
- Anna!

1074
01:25:55,571 --> 01:25:56,730
Anna, open the door!

1075
01:26:03,838 --> 01:26:05,133
Anna, I need your help!

1076
01:26:07,903 --> 01:26:09,994
- Stop!
Don't move!

1077
01:26:10,104 --> 01:26:11,093
- No!

1078
01:26:18,470 --> 01:26:20,129
- Terry!

1079
01:26:20,236 --> 01:26:22,429
Shut up!

1080
01:26:22,536 --> 01:26:23,627
- Don't move!
- Get off me!

1081
01:26:27,103 --> 01:26:29,796
- Give me a hand.

1082
01:26:34,602 --> 01:26:36,897
- 508 is empty.

1083
01:26:37,002 --> 01:26:38,491
We never fill it.

1084
01:26:40,569 --> 01:26:42,796
You can see for yourself.

1085
01:26:50,634 --> 01:26:51,725
You see?

1086
01:26:55,267 --> 01:26:56,358
- The way he was acting,

1087
01:26:56,468 --> 01:26:58,524
I just---
I didn't know.

1088
01:26:58,633 --> 01:26:59,621
- It's all right, miss.

1089
01:26:59,734 --> 01:27:01,928
Take your time.

1090
01:27:08,867 --> 01:27:11,697
- He came to my room,
and he said---

1091
01:27:11,799 --> 01:27:12,788
well, he told me---

1092
01:27:12,900 --> 01:27:15,025
he wanted me to say
that if anyone asked,

1093
01:27:15,134 --> 01:27:17,065
that we had been
together tonight.

1094
01:27:19,567 --> 01:27:21,896
Then when he came to my room,
there was blood on him.

1095
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:24,125
I-I saw it.
