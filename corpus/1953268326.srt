(CRYING)

685
01:18:53,195 --> 01:18:56,233
WINK:
All right, fatso, breathe some air.

686
01:19:02,804 --> 01:19:04,579
I need to go home.

687
01:19:12,114 --> 01:19:13,889
(INAUDIBLE)

688
01:19:40,909 --> 01:19:43,981
<i>If that isn't love
It'll have to do</i>

689
01:19:45,680 --> 01:19:48,684
<i>Until the real thing comes along</i>

690
01:20:45,807 --> 01:20:47,650
(HOOVES APPROACHING)

691
01:21:04,960 --> 01:21:06,337
(SCREAMING)

692
01:21:31,019 --> 01:21:32,498
(SNORTING)

693
01:21:50,972 --> 01:21:52,645
(SNIFFING)

694
01:22:11,493 --> 01:22:13,734
You're my friend, kind of.

695
01:22:25,006 --> 01:22:27,282
I gotta take care of mine.

696
01:24:14,916 --> 01:24:16,691
Real good.

697
01:24:36,204 --> 01:24:38,241
No crying, hear?

698
01:24:40,208 --> 01:24:41,949
No crying.

699
01:24:58,693 --> 01:25:00,468
Don't you cry.

700
01:25:05,900 --> 01:25:07,846
(WINK SOBBING)

701
01:26:09,063 --> 01:26:14,843
ALL: As I stand by the bayou,
I watch a ship as she disappears.

702
01:26:15,003 --> 01:26:16,448
There, she is gone.

703
01:26:16,604 --> 01:26:19,084
And we cry for this.

704
01:26:19,240 --> 01:26:20,947
But she's not gone.

705
01:26:21,109 --> 01:26:24,818
She's just as real as when she left me.

706
01:26:24,979 --> 01:26:28,188
And somewhere else,
other voices are calling out:

707
01:26:28,349 --> 01:26:29,953
"Here she comes."

708
01:26:30,118 --> 01:26:32,291
And that is dying.

709
01:26:32,453 --> 01:26:35,366
Here she comes!

710
01:26:45,867 --> 01:26:49,212
<i>When it all goes quiet
behind my eyes...</i>

711
01:26:49,370 --> 01:26:51,441
<i>...I see everything that made me...</i>

712
01:26:51,606 --> 01:26:54,553
<i>...flying around in invisible pieces.</i>

713
01:26:59,247 --> 01:27:02,524
<i>When I look too hard, it goes away.</i>

714
01:27:03,484 --> 01:27:07,261
<i>But when it all goes quiet,
I see they are right here.</i>

715
01:27:08,823 --> 01:27:13,169
<i>I see that I'm a little piece
of a big, big universe.</i>

716
01:27:14,262 --> 01:27:16,401
<i>And that makes things right.</i>

717
01:27:20,835 --> 01:27:24,681
<i>When I die, the scientists of the future...</i>

718
01:27:24,839 --> 01:27:27,376
<i>...they're going to find it all.</i>

719
01:27:27,542 --> 01:27:29,215
<i>They're going to know...</i>

720
01:27:30,044 --> 01:27:31,682
<i>...once, there was a Hushpuppy...</i>

721
01:27:31,846 --> 01:27:34,656
<i>...and she lived with her daddy
in the Bathtub.</i>
