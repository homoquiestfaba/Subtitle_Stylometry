1
00:00:07,984 --> 00:00:12,040
I tell you,James, There's no
virtue if there's no immorality.

2
00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:18,330
I met a waitress last night.

3
00:00:18,340 --> 00:00:22,000
Big--I mean big
ol' butt on her.

4
00:00:22,530 --> 00:00:25,330
A waitress with a big butt
doesn't seem so uncommon.

5
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:27,060
Perfectly uncommon.

6
00:00:27,070 --> 00:00:31,790
Like 20 pounds of sunshine
in a 10-pound bag. MMM !

7
00:00:32,210 --> 00:00:33,440
How's your wife?

8
00:00:33,980 --> 00:00:35,200
Oh,she good.

9
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:35,970
The girls ?

10
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:37,660
They great.

11
00:00:38,251 --> 00:00:39,156
Trip the alarm,will ya?

12
00:01:16,838 --> 00:01:18,360
<i>It's time to do this,baby
girl. Andele vamanos!</i>

13
00:01:37,716 --> 00:01:39,079
It's all clear.

14
00:01:45,770 --> 00:01:47,760
Eight minutes. Not bad.

15
00:01:47,860 --> 00:01:50,110
Gung-ho bastards.
Must be rookies. Ha ha.

16
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:24,390
Sid Vicious, Ottis Redding

17
00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:26,480
Tim Bukelley and Karen Cochran.

18
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:29,120
Overdose,plane crash, overdose

19
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,940
and underdose.

20
00:02:33,990 --> 00:02:34,810
Ten minutes forty.

21
00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:45,100
The Battle of Chalons.

22
00:02:45,310 --> 00:02:47,280
451 A.D.

23
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,060
Attila's defeat by Aetius.

24
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:49,730
Duck!

25
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:53,630
It's another false alarm.

26
00:02:53,630 --> 00:02:54,750
Let's get out of here.

27
00:03:01,810 --> 00:03:02,800
26 minutes

28
00:03:03,230 --> 00:03:06,420
We've officially cried wolf

29
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:11,360
You know Mother Teresa
didn't believe in God.

30
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:12,350
No?

31
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:16,990
No

32
00:03:21,470 --> 00:03:22,410
Watch your feet.

33
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:23,600
You're kidding, right?

34
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:28,370
Mother Teresa did not believe in God.

35
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,280
You can't say that !

36
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:32,700
She definitely questioned his existence

37
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:33,530
in some of her letters.

38
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:35,770
Are you guilt-reading again?

39
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:36,020
Listen

40
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:38,840
After she heard Jesus' voice
on the train to Darjeeling--

41
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:40,640
Allegedly.And if so,

42
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:42,250
she never heard from him again.

43
00:03:42,350 --> 00:03:43,650
Well,I can see how she could doubt.

44
00:03:43,650 --> 00:03:45,120
But not to believe ? I don't buy it.

45
00:03:50,770 --> 00:03:51,900
Maybe she was faking it.

46
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:53,240
Faking it ?

47
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:56,020
Because we all know how much
fun it is to work with lepers.

48
00:03:56,020 --> 00:03:57,240
Can we work now ?

49
00:03:57,540 --> 00:03:58,660
Oh,I'm done.

50
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:14,190
Yeah,baby! Done a
trick. Done a trick,baby.

51
00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:21,200
That's right,yeah. We did
it,baby. Who's the man now,huh?

52
00:04:24,420 --> 00:04:25,090
Police! Freeze!

53
00:04:47,710 --> 00:04:48,770
Put the gun down!

54
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:50,230
<i>Put the gun down or I will kill him!</i>

55
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:51,240
<i>Get back!</i>

56
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:53,340
I'll kill him.

57
00:04:53,650 --> 00:04:54,820
I'll kill him right here.

58
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:56,550
<i>Put it down,Lutha.</i>

59
00:04:57,010 --> 00:04:58,460
Put the gun down.

60
00:04:58,420 --> 00:04:59,530
You bitch !

61
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:38,050
The Bloc Team Present To You Heist

62
00:05:43,670 --> 00:05:44,730
How we doing,Bill?

63
00:05:45,140 --> 00:05:45,510
Pretty good.

64
00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:49,220
<i>I got some of those self-help
tapes. You know, Personal Power.</i>

65
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:50,840
I'm hoping it'll help me
with some of my weight issues.

66
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:53,150
You know,everybody
says "do more cardio,"

67
00:05:53,150 --> 00:05:54,020
but my knees
just can't--

68
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:56,110
I meant how are we doing here?

69
00:05:57,510 --> 00:05:58,520
Oh. Multiple alarms.

70
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:00,900
Hollywood division
responded three times.

71
00:06:00,910 --> 00:06:02,790
Then logged it as an alarm malfunction

72
00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:05,750
Good police work there,huh?

73
00:06:06,030 --> 00:06:07,850
Anyway,uh,last alarm went off at 3:00.

74
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:09,590
Guy opened up at 9:00.

75
00:06:09,670 --> 00:06:11,610
Point of entry-- the
sledgehammered door.

76
00:06:11,610 --> 00:06:12,540
Point
of exit--

77
00:00:12,640 --> 00:06:14,080
The sledgehammered door.

78
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:15,370
Bingo.

79
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:16,790
You got a list of the stolen items ?

80
00:06:17,370 --> 00:06:18,970
Uh,item. Singular.

81
00:06:19,030 --> 00:06:23,270
<i>The owner... Gave us a picture.</i>

82
00:06:26,550 --> 00:06:28,260
It's an Incan talisman.

83
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:29,470
That means good luck charm.

84
00:06:29,470 --> 00:06:33,860
Actually,a talisman is,
uh,used to ward off evil spirits

85
00:06:34,590 --> 00:06:36,330
Just saying it didn't work, is all.

86
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:38,660
Anyway,it's valued at about eight grand.

87
00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:41,460
What they didn't take was the
bracelet that was sitting next to it.

88
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:43,700
Which cost over 80.

89
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:44,770
Good work on the safe too.

90
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:46,040
Immaculate.

91
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:48,180
We're never going to solve this one.

92
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:51,780
A good cop would.

93
00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:55,050
Right.

94
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:05,360
Keep  your enemies close.

95
00:07:25,190 --> 00:07:26,280
How's it going,baby?

96
00:07:31,550 --> 00:07:33,650
Never call me baby.

97
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:35,260
The name's Lola.

98
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:36,960
I'm Ricky. You hurt my upper lip. -I'm
here for the job. Not dinner and a movie.

99
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:38,300
I'm here for the job

100
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:39,490
Not dinner and a movie.

101
00:07:42,290 --> 00:07:43,800
Look at this guy.

102
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:48,020
I ain't working with no mothball. -Ooh.

103
00:07:50,730 --> 00:07:51,970
How's it going,baby?

104
00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:53,290
I'm Lola.

105
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:55,350
They call me Pops.

106
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:56,120
Shall we ?

107
00:07:56,350 --> 00:07:58,430
He hurts my lower lip.

108
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:03,600
Who are you ?

109
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,380
Who am I ?

110
00:08:05,380 --> 00:08:08,140
I'm Gatsby. I'm freakin' Spartacus.

111
00:08:08,140 --> 00:08:10,740
But my name,for your purposes, is James.

112
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:11,540
Never Jimmy.

113
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:14,540
Never Jim and never,ever,Jimbo.

114
00:08:16,890 --> 00:08:18,160
James.

115
00:08:19,190 --> 00:08:21,620
Hi,James. Where's the pisser?

116
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:23,350
Long  bus ride.

117
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:31,710
You're all here

118
00:08:31,710 --> 00:08:34,160
because you are the
very best at what you do.

119
00:08:34,490 --> 00:08:37,120
That being said, this job
is going to be dangerous.

120
00:08:37,420 --> 00:08:38,740
Possibly  deadly.

121
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:40,530
But extremely lucrative.

122
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:42,720
How much we talking about,Mick?

123
00:08:43,830 --> 00:08:45,210
Half a billion.

124
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,040
With a B ?

125
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:48,560
Yeah.

126
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:54,600
Welcome to Rodeo Drive.

127
00:08:56,070 --> 00:08:57,260
Quite possibly

128
00:08:57,260 --> 00:08:59,540
The most expensive three-block stretch

129
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:00,660
in the world.

130
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:03,160
Anything worth stealing can be found

131
00:00:12,040 --> 00:09:04,330
right here.

132
00:09:04,340 --> 00:09:08,170
It is also home to three of the
most exclusive jewelry stores

133
00:09:08,170 --> 00:09:09,840
in the world.

134
00:09:10,310 --> 00:09:11,680
So which one we gonna hit ?

135
00:09:11,990 --> 00:09:13,150
All of them.

136
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:15,080
Whoa,whoa. Hold on,Mick.

137
00:09:15,090 --> 00:09:18,100
I'm as horny as the next
guy for half a billion.

138
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:20,130
But how in the hell do you
plan on pulling this off?

139
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:21,700
Not how.When.

140
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:22,260
When ?

141
00:09:22,630 --> 00:09:23,320
Tomorrow.

142
00:09:23,420 --> 00:09:24,430
You're insane.

143
00:09:24,690 --> 00:09:27,180
No. We go during Academy Awards week.

144
00:09:27,511 --> 00:09:29,616
When the most expensive
jewelry on the planet

145
00:09:29,628 --> 00:09:31,840
will be moving through these stores.

146
00:09:32,706 --> 00:09:33,889
So where do we start ?

147
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:35,390
We'll need some working capital.

148
00:09:35,390 --> 00:09:36,670
Ooh,a bank ?

149
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:38,570
No,dummy. We're going to take out

150
00:09:38,570 --> 00:09:40,000
a small business loan.

151
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,360
Yes. A bank.

152
00:09:50,710 --> 00:09:53,620
I'm just saying, your people
don't make good quarterbackss

153
00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:54,230
What?

154
00:09:54,330 --> 00:09:56,610
<i>Your people. They don't
make good quarterbacks.</i>

155
00:09:56,611 --> 00:09:59,510
Now you're an idiot and a racist.

156
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:01,570
Vick,McNabb,
Culpepper,McNair--

157
00:10:01,570 --> 00:10:04,400
How would you feel if I said
all Irish people were drunks ?

158
00:10:04,530 --> 00:10:06,350
Well,we have to be, to
put up with the blacks.

159
00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:07,920
What did you say?

160
00:10:08,110 --> 00:10:09,990
Oh,I'm sorry. African Americans.

161
00:10:11,790 --> 00:10:13,340
Billy--they want us
in the briefing room.

162
00:10:13,690 --> 00:10:14,070
Good.

163
00:10:14,070 --> 00:10:15,740
I think I made my point here.

164
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:18,480
Last night's jewelry store
robbery had no witnesses,

165
00:10:18,490 --> 00:10:18,920
no prints,

166
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:20,660
no physical evidence.

167
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,230
I've asked Metro to surveil
a couple of stores...

168
00:10:13,650 --> 00:10:26,510
<i>-So did you call that girl?
-Yeah. She give you a wrong number? Yeah.</i>

169
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:31,020
Is there something you
want to share,Detective ?

170
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:33,970
Maybe. Can I take my pants off

171
00:10:41,910 --> 00:10:43,250
Hey! Wanna go two out of three?

172
00:10:45,250 --> 00:10:47,210
Then shut your mouth and listen.

173
00:10:47,490 --> 00:10:49,750
As detectives, you all suck,

174
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:50,480
okay ??

175
00:10:50,540 --> 00:10:52,410
Got the job, got lazy,

176
00:10:52,410 --> 00:10:54,330
and figured you could what?

177
00:10:54,330 --> 00:10:55,790
Phone it in until your
pensions kicked in?

178
00:10:56,060 --> 00:10:58,050
Well,that's done. Over.

179
00:10:58,170 --> 00:11:00,390
Because bottom line is,
I'm not going anywhere.

180
00:11:00,430 --> 00:11:02,500
So you better hurry up and
get serious about your jobs.

181
00:11:02,510 --> 00:11:06,240
Otherwise I will kick your
asses straight out of RHD.

182
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:11,180
All right. That's all.

183
00:11:15,390 --> 00:11:16,900
Evans and O'Brien.

184
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:18,390
Stay for a second.

185
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:21,400
Yes, Detective?

186
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:23,520
I'm making a partner change.

187
00:11:23,530 --> 00:11:25,680
I want you working with O'Brien.

188
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:28,840
No. With him ? No.

189
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:30,750
Yes.

190
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:33,950
Let's see if we can get some better
chemistry going on in this division.

191
00:11:34,530 --> 00:11:36,000
You know what? I want to go on record

192
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,090
as being strongly opposed
to this move,all right?

193
00:11:38,490 --> 00:11:42,150
He's, he's lazy. He's
obnoxious. He's fat. He's racist.

194
00:11:42,290 --> 00:11:43,490
I'm standing right here.

195
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:48,350
Request a transfer if you don't like it.

196
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:50,380
Now come on. Let's get to work.

197
00:11:52,570 --> 00:11:54,340
<i>This is just like Lethal Weapon.</i>

198
00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:56,550
Except I actually do hate you.

199
00:11:57,590 --> 00:11:59,420
Who you supposed to be, Mel Gibson? Eh.

200
00:12:18,050 --> 00:12:20,450
Pizza. -How you
doing,it's 17-- -Whoa,man!

201
00:12:22,220 --> 00:12:24,380
Why you rob banks,Mick?

202
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:26,680
Because that's where the money is.

203
00:12:27,210 --> 00:12:28,010
Grander scale.

204
00:12:28,020 --> 00:12:29,830
Like instead of being a fireman

205
00:12:29,830 --> 00:12:31,270
or a shortstop ?

206
00:12:31,370 --> 00:12:33,140
Why not be a fireman ?

207
00:12:33,310 --> 00:12:34,230
I don't like the hats.

208
00:12:34,230 --> 00:12:35,780
Point the camera that way.

209
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,280
Four eyes in the sky

210
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:43,220
Two guards. One Social
Security,one in diapers.

211
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:44,690
Bulletproof glass.

212
00:12:44,770 --> 00:12:47,020
Bullet resistant acrylic.

213
00:12:47,170 --> 00:12:49,100
Only an inch and a quarter thick.

214
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:51,170
Everybody is cutting corners.

215
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:53,580
Ultimately how I turned out is

216
00:12:53,590 --> 00:12:57,020
probably a product of my childhood
and my inability to believe in systems.

217
00:12:57,060 --> 00:12:58,010
So...

218
00:12:58,350 --> 00:12:59,940
You've given this some thought.

219
00:13:00,020 --> 00:13:00,430
Sure.

220
00:13:00,890 --> 00:13:02,980
Once I saw how things worked,

221
00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:04,150
or didn't work,

222
00:13:04,210 --> 00:13:05,360
the absurdity
of it all--

223
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:07,810
I guess I'm talking
about consciousness here--

224
00:13:07,810 --> 00:13:10,720
robbing faceless, hegemonic
corporations seemed,

225
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:12,860
in a strange way, the right thing to do.

226
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:14,030
I'm speaking just for me.

227
00:13:14,330 --> 00:13:15,690
Can you get the vault from here ?

228
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:16,520
I'm on it.

229
00:13:18,730 --> 00:13:21,380
Have you ever tried a
non-authoritarian collective

230
00:13:21,380 --> 00:13:22,420
like a Kibbutz ?

231
00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:23,730
I  have.

232
00:13:23,730 --> 00:13:25,550
It doesn't work for me.

233
00:13:27,290 --> 00:13:28,660
Oh,no. Look over there.

234
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:33,230
I think it's time to leave.

235
00:13:33,350 --> 00:13:34,450
What?

236
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:34,720
Why?

237
00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:37,990
Well,it's a little warm  for a
giant parka. Don't you think ?

238
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:39,010
You saying
he's here--

239
00:13:39,010 --> 00:13:40,370
Well,it looks that way.

240
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:43,020
Unbelievable. He going to
rob this joint before us?

241
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:44,810
That ain't right. Look,I'm
going to say something to him.

242
00:13:44,810 --> 00:13:46,790
Let's not get caught up in this drama.

243
00:13:46,850 --> 00:13:49,000
That's just rude,is all that is.

244
00:13:56,930 --> 00:13:58,390
You're not calling this in.

245
00:13:58,610 --> 00:13:59,490
Oh,hell yeah.

246
00:14:00,050 --> 00:14:02,530
There's a bank robbery
happening right now.

247
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:06,090
California Financial at the
corner of Ventura and Reed. Hurry.

248
00:14:07,450 --> 00:14:09,210
You're very competitive.

249
00:14:09,550 --> 00:14:10,900
this is a robbery !

250
00:14:11,130 --> 00:14:12,500
Everybody down !

251
00:14:13,530 --> 00:14:15,570
I said everybody down !

252
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:19,880
You know,you really made
it more difficult on him

253
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:20,410
by calling it in.

254
00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:22,400
Well,he should have
been more well-mannered.

255
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:24,510
Besides,we can get some
nice tactical footage

256
00:14:24,510 --> 00:14:26,520
of our police friends in action.

257
00:14:28,930 --> 00:14:29,600
Hey,hurry up,man!

258
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:43,780
<i>Stop right there!</i>

259
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:46,920
<i>Now! I said stop!</i>

260
00:14:46,930 --> 00:14:51,320
<i>Drop the bags! I said,drop the bags.</i>

261
00:14:54,270 --> 00:14:55,080
<i>Drop the bags! I said,keep them up.</i>

262
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:56,470
Well,that's that.

263
00:14:56,670 --> 00:14:57,630
Let's get out of here.

264
00:14:58,350 --> 00:15:01,780
Damn amateurs. Spoiling
it For everybody.

265
00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:03,750
You know, I'm sick of these fools.

266
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:13,730
Maybe I shouldn't call it in.

267
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:21,500
<i>This is awful.</i>

268
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:24,020
Looks like a miniature golf course.

269
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:26,180
Hey,I got something over here.

270
00:15:27,180 --> 00:15:28,930
You got something ?

271
00:15:28,990 --> 00:15:30,160
Write this down.

272
00:15:32,070 --> 00:15:35,710
Remaining eye, unresponsive.

273
00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:38,080
Oh that's sick,man. I
ain't writing that down.

274
00:15:38,380 --> 00:15:39,740
Why would this guy blow himself up?

275
00:15:39,761 --> 00:15:41,100
What do you got, Doug?

276
00:15:41,780 --> 00:15:43,090
Radio detonator.

277
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:45,110
Someone could have set it off by remote.

278
00:15:45,122 --> 00:15:46,061
Cell phone,even.

279
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:48,830
He definitely did not
trigger it himself.

280
00:15:49,050 --> 00:15:50,650
This  kid was no bank robber.

281
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:52,390
He was a hostage.

282
00:15:54,110 --> 00:15:54,570
Mm-hmm. Thanks

283
00:15:54,710 --> 00:15:55,550
You guys....

284
00:15:56,570 --> 00:15:59,620
We're changing the file log.
From suicide to homicide.

285
00:15:59,730 --> 00:16:00,930
Somebody else triggered the bomb

286
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:02,020
Yeah.

287
00:16:02,780 --> 00:16:04,040
Find out who.

288
00:16:06,410 --> 00:16:07,190
So,you hungry ?

289
00:16:07,370 --> 00:16:08,070
Grab a bite ?

290
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:09,230
Tacos,maybe.

291
00:16:09,850 --> 00:16:12,810
Man,you just finished picking an eyeballoff
the street. How can you even think about food?

292
00:16:13,570 --> 00:16:14,560
Focus.

293
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:17,660
You--you-- not right
in the head,man.

294
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:22,780
Hi,it's me. Sorry I'm late.

295
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:25,460
<i>Hi., She's in the other room.</i>

296
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:26,770
She had a good day.

297
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:27,280
Great.

298
00:16:27,450 --> 00:16:28,640
See you tomorrow. Thanks.

299
00:16:39,850 --> 00:16:41,410
You've gotten more beautiful again.

300
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:43,040
I know you ?

301
00:16:43,130 --> 00:16:44,550
You know me.

302
00:16:46,140 --> 00:16:47,220
I'm your husband.

303
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:49,660
Of course you are George.

304
00:16:52,010 --> 00:16:54,110
George was your first husband.

305
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:55,430
He died.

306
00:16:55,430 --> 00:16:56,630
I'm Robert.

307
00:16:56,990 --> 00:16:59,160
It was a lovely funeral.

308
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:06,830
Blue violets are my favorite flower.

309
00:17:07,090 --> 00:17:08,220
I know.

310
00:17:11,420 --> 00:17:12,820
Robert !!

311
00:17:13,350 --> 00:17:14,810
When did you get here ?

312
00:17:14,810 --> 00:17:16,250
Just now.

313
00:17:16,870 --> 00:17:19,190
You haven't been getting into trouble.

314
00:17:19,630 --> 00:17:20,460
No.

315
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:22,380
No trouble.

316
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:32,520
You know,for me, it's
not about the money.

317
00:17:32,670 --> 00:17:35,430
It's about--
the thrill.

318
00:17:35,780 --> 00:17:37,020
For me it's the money.

319
00:17:37,070 --> 00:17:40,050
That's what I meant.
Like,the thrill of the money.

320
00:17:40,050 --> 00:17:42,880
Like seeing it lying out on
the table in front of you.

321
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:44,580
Spread out,spilling out.

322
00:17:44,670 --> 00:17:46,590
That is thrilling.

323
00:17:46,610 --> 00:17:47,990
You're in it or the thrill,right?

324
00:17:47,990 --> 00:17:48,860
Kind of

325
00:17:49,010 --> 00:17:50,390
a thrill-seeker?

326
00:17:50,420 --> 00:17:52,930
I'm actually quite calculating

327
00:17:52,930 --> 00:17:55,290
That's what I meant. You
calculate your thrills.

328
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:59,200
You're thrilled by the money.

329
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:00,560
Like me.

330
00:18:01,310 --> 00:18:02,090
So.....

331
00:18:02,780 --> 00:18:03,530
I'm right.

332
00:18:04,290 --> 00:18:05,240
You're an idiot.

333
00:18:06,130 --> 00:18:07,950
Do you like music ?
'Cause I have made....

334
00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:10,740
a perfect mix...

335
00:18:11,620 --> 00:18:12,940
for this heist.

336
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:16,460
Great., A moron with a soundtrack.

337
00:18:16,850 --> 00:18:17,400
It's okay.

338
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:19,420
I have extras.

339
00:18:20,610 --> 00:18:23,450
I work out. Three times a week.

340
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:25,830
You should try four.

341
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:37,120
Okay. Set up the equipment in the trunk.

342
00:18:37,210 --> 00:18:37,640
When ?

343
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:39,780
Now !!

344
00:19:07,540 --> 00:19:08,640
Did you get it? ?

345
00:19:10,410 --> 00:19:11,410
Got it

346
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:15,260
Did you see her naked ?

347
00:19:15,260 --> 00:19:17,150
Yeah. We took a shower together.

348
00:19:17,150 --> 00:19:19,090
Oh,that is so hot.

349
00:19:19,230 --> 00:19:21,100
Let's see what this lady cop is into.

350
00:19:21,790 --> 00:19:22,410
Visa

351
00:19:23,140 --> 00:19:24,590
Mastercard

352
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,270
Driver's license.

353
00:19:29,930 --> 00:19:30,830
I gotta get this back.

354
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:33,020
Start the car and keep it running.

355
00:19:34,110 --> 00:19:35,780
I think I love you.

356
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:49,170
Excuse me.

357
00:19:50,470 --> 00:19:51,150
Is that yours ?

358
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:55,100
It looked like it fell
out of your locker.

359
00:20:00,710 --> 00:20:01,230
Thanks.

360
00:20:01,620 --> 00:20:03,450
Sure. Have a good one.

361
00:20:08,210 --> 00:20:09,800
What do we have on the cop ?

362
00:20:09,910 --> 00:20:10,810
Pretty dull.

363
00:20:10,810 --> 00:20:12,700
Mostly credit card debt.

364
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:14,020
Health club,restaurants.

365
00:20:14,020 --> 00:20:15,210
A bit of a shoe whore.

366
00:20:15,350 --> 00:20:17,020
I did find something.

367
00:20:17,170 --> 00:20:18,760
Dancing lessons.

368
00:20:18,780 --> 00:20:20,190
I'm going to check it out tonight.

369
00:20:20,230 --> 00:20:21,920
Oh,I  got it.

370
00:20:22,030 --> 00:20:24,880
You think it's smart to
show your face this early?

371
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:26,170
I said I got it.

372
00:20:27,140 --> 00:20:28,130
Fine.

373
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:40,900
Chin up.

374
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:16,130
Uh,ma'am?

375
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:18,390
Ma'am.

376
00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:22,730
I got to tell you, that was real slick.

377
00:21:22,730 --> 00:21:24,440
I'm sorry. Do I know you ?

378
00:21:24,580 --> 00:21:26,660
Store security. Please open your jacket.

379
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:28,030
I'm a cop.

380
00:21:28,430 --> 00:21:31,140
And I'm flattered you go against
your oath as a peace officer.

381
00:21:31,150 --> 00:21:36,050
However,taking an 8-pack of Gillette Daisy
razors is not a good way to meet someone.

382
00:21:36,050 --> 00:21:38,380
Now hand over the loot,lady.

383
00:21:38,660 --> 00:21:39,970
You're not store security.

384
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:40,490
No

385
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:43,390
But if I was, you'd have
a real problem right now.

386
00:21:44,430 --> 00:21:47,160
You look familiar. eHave
I ever arrested you ?

387
00:21:48,030 --> 00:21:49,740
Dance class.

388
00:21:49,780 --> 00:21:52,310
Ah,yes.That's right. Dance class.

389
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:54,180
Just started. I,uh,I'm Mickey.

390
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:56,060
Amy.

391
00:21:56,570 --> 00:21:58,920
So,uh,Amy the cop.

392
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:00,930
Why take the razors ?

393
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:03,090
Ever tried waxing?

394
00:22:03,450 --> 00:22:04,520
Once.

395
00:22:04,670 --> 00:22:05,970
Never again.

396
00:22:06,190 --> 00:22:08,690
So,which is more fun?

397
00:22:08,830 --> 00:22:11,820
The cops ? Or the robbers ?

398
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,750
I don't know yet.

399
00:23:17,740 --> 00:23:19,340
Hey,Janey. How'd it go?

400
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:25,020
Sorry I didn't make it. I
really wanted to be here.

401
00:23:28,050 --> 00:23:29,860
Didn't go so well,huh?

402
00:23:29,990 --> 00:23:31,460
It's not that.

403
00:23:32,070 --> 00:23:33,890
She thought she saw her father tonight.

404
00:23:33,930 --> 00:23:34,610
Mickey ?

405
00:23:34,610 --> 00:23:36,440
He's been dead seven years.

406
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:37,330
I know.

407
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,520
Let's just give her a little space.

408
00:23:48,540 --> 00:23:50,010
Throw me the keys!

409
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:00,010
Sorry,Mick.

410
00:24:32,370 --> 00:24:34,930
This is Detective
Sykes, Robbery Homicide.

411
00:24:34,970 --> 00:24:37,700
I have seven reports from the
Cal Financial bank robbery.

412
00:24:37,740 --> 00:24:39,740
The manifest report said there
were eight units on scene.

413
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:41,550
Can you find that missing report ?

414
00:24:41,550 --> 00:24:42,530
<i>Excuse me,Detective?</i>

415
00:24:45,690 --> 00:24:46,640
Thanks.

416
00:24:48,980 --> 00:24:50,550
Um,I'm going to have to call you back.

417
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:52,310
Evans, O'Brian.

418
00:24:53,580 --> 00:24:56,710
Another pizza delivery guy was
reported missing about two hours ago

419
00:24:56,970 --> 00:24:59,140
That's what's taking so long.

420
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:00,690
Delivery was to a motel room.

421
00:25:00,750 --> 00:25:02,800
The room was cleared out by the
time a black and white got there.

422
00:25:02,810 --> 00:25:05,600
These guys are going again.
What do we got on the first bank?

423
00:25:05,610 --> 00:25:08,870
Well,the bank received a large delivery
of money that Thursday night before closing

424
00:25:08,870 --> 00:25:10,090
So I figured--
-We figure.

425
00:25:10,090 --> 00:25:14,310
They hit it early Friday before the factory
workers had a chance to cash their payroll checks

426
00:25:14,310 --> 00:25:15,940
It's close to freeway exits,

427
00:25:15,940 --> 00:25:17,530
and it also gave them a location

428
00:25:17,530 --> 00:25:19,220
where they got maximum
police on-scene time

429
00:25:19,220 --> 00:25:20,460
It's eight and a half minutes.

430
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:23,860
Okay,I want you to find me
every bank that fits that profile

431
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:26,690
Work your sources. Somebody's going to
keep trying until they get this right.

432
00:25:27,050 --> 00:25:28,220
What makes you so sure ?

433
00:25:28,550 --> 00:25:30,050
They didn't get the money !

434
00:25:32,090 --> 00:25:35,150
I have a feeling we won't
have to rob a bank after all

435
00:25:35,670 --> 00:25:40,830
All the news reports said witnesses saw
him get out of the cab and into the bank.

436
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:44,340
The cab pulls away just before
the first cop car gets there.

437
00:25:44,340 --> 00:25:45,270
Why ?

438
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:48,830
How would he know the cops are coming, and
why would he care? He's just waiting on a fare.

439
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:51,680
Unless that cab was
my man's getaway car.

440
00:25:51,980 --> 00:25:52,770
Bingo.

441
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:54,360
Okay,

442
00:25:54,370 --> 00:25:55,690
But what if the cab was stolen?

443
00:25:55,690 --> 00:25:56,690
Already checked. Wasn't.

444
00:25:56,690 --> 00:26:00,280
So if the cab is in on it, all we
have to do is get an address on him

445
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:01,240
and stake him.

446
00:26:01,460 --> 00:26:03,430
Ricky and Lola are already on it.

447
00:26:03,430 --> 00:26:05,400
So, why you tellin' me all this now?

448
00:26:05,410 --> 00:26:06,710
'Cause you weren't here earlier.

449
00:26:06,710 --> 00:26:07,660
I got a phone.

450
00:26:08,590 --> 00:26:12,240
I mean,come on,Mick.I'm your partner,
I shouldn't be the last one to know.

451
00:26:13,030 --> 00:26:14,180
You're right.

452
00:26:14,250 --> 00:26:16,140
And I'm sorry,James.

453
00:26:19,490 --> 00:26:20,580
Okay

454
00:26:20,590 --> 00:26:22,260
Now I feel better.

455
00:26:22,860 --> 00:26:23,950
We're not gonna hug.

456
00:26:23,950 --> 00:26:25,270
Aw,hell no !!

457
00:27:21,250 --> 00:27:23,030
So, do you ride horses ?

458
00:27:25,630 --> 00:27:27,860
I hate horses.

459
00:27:30,980 --> 00:27:33,020
Not talking about poneys.

460
00:27:34,330 --> 00:27:36,200
Talking about full-growns.

461
00:27:36,380 --> 00:27:37,820
<i>Full-growns ?</i>

462
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:40,270
<i>What the hell is a full-grown ?</i>

463
00:27:42,250 --> 00:27:45,990
We are two blocks
from my ex-girlfriend.

464
00:27:48,210 --> 00:27:50,910
Teresa. She broke my heart.

465
00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:54,750
Hey,do you know what's
got a lot of protein ?

466
00:27:55,070 --> 00:27:56,750
Walnuts. Do you like walnuts ?

467
00:27:56,750 --> 00:27:58,280
Can you shut up ?

468
00:28:03,430 --> 00:28:05,740
I'm just trying to get
to know you, that's all.

469
00:28:06,250 --> 00:28:08,020
<i>Wanna know about me?</i>

470
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:11,280
<i>I don't like people who talk too much.</i>

471
00:28:11,310 --> 00:28:12,450
Oh,me neither.

472
00:28:12,570 --> 00:28:13,880
What else ?

473
00:28:14,850 --> 00:28:16,420
<i>I like craps, not blackjack.</i>

474
00:28:16,420 --> 00:28:18,190
<i>White frosting, not chocolate.</i>

475
00:28:18,190 --> 00:28:19,860
<i>Dogs,not cats. Length,not girth.</i>

476
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:23,630
<i>I like men, not boys.</i>

477
00:28:23,630 --> 00:28:25,600
Clapton,not Page.

478
00:28:25,660 --> 00:28:27,540
Clapton,not Page ??

479
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:29,920
You out of your mind?

480
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:32,640
Did you even listen to my mix?

481
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:36,290
I like football, not
baseball. Tequila,not vodka and

482
00:28:36,290 --> 00:28:38,330
And I always thought it'd
be cool to be an astronaut

483
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:40,330
Are you satisfied ? Now shut up.

484
00:28:40,330 --> 00:28:42,370
Transmitting now.

485
00:29:09,060 --> 00:29:10,010
Got it

486
00:29:10,010 --> 00:29:12,800
<i>You were right--
delivery guy,explosives.</i>

487
00:29:12,820 --> 00:29:14,090
Okay,let's go.

488
00:29:15,310 --> 00:29:16,940
Come on, let's go

489
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,070
Check

490
00:29:25,490 --> 00:29:26,550
Check

491
00:29:27,090 --> 00:29:29,430
Good,keep it coming,straight.
That's it, old man.

492
00:29:29,810 --> 00:29:33,260
Keep it coming,grandpa.

493
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:35,720
Five feet... STOP !!!!

494
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:40,070
Nice, did you steal this?

495
00:29:40,250 --> 00:29:44,160
No,I won it in Bingo.
Just get to work, stupid.

496
00:29:57,840 --> 00:29:59,970
I got it, I got it.

497
00:29:59,980 --> 00:30:02,340
I don't got it, I don't got it

498
00:30:03,450 --> 00:30:05,820
This ain't gonna work,
it needs to be quick.

499
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,360
I got an idea.

500
00:30:12,830 --> 00:30:14,250
How that's gonna help?

501
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:20,740
Titanium. Stronger than
steel, light as a feather.

502
00:30:26,290 --> 00:30:28,020
<i>You just bought this.</i>

503
00:30:29,150 --> 00:30:31,380
These are the two banks
that fit our profile.

504
00:30:31,448 --> 00:30:35,380
I want extra units in both areas. And I
want SWAT no more than five minutes out.

505
00:30:35,390 --> 00:30:38,620
<i>Even if we do find the right bank,</i>

506
00:30:38,620 --> 00:30:40,000
how do we make sure that our
pizza guy-- Keeps his toppings?

507
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:41,830
We contain and follow.

508
00:30:42,010 --> 00:30:44,690
Evans,I want you to be liaison
between the divisions on this.

509
00:30:44,820 --> 00:30:45,850
You got it.

510
00:30:47,190 --> 00:30:48,440
Come on, big boy.

511
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:15,390
<i>Hey. Hey! Everybody,</i>

512
00:31:15,610 --> 00:31:17,060
this is a robbery.

513
00:31:17,060 --> 00:31:20,410
Do what I say, or everybody dies.

514
00:31:26,010 --> 00:31:27,390
Yeah, no, we're on it.

515
00:31:31,100 --> 00:31:35,180
Detective. A guy wrapped in explosives
just walked into Bank National downtown.

516
00:31:51,130 --> 00:31:54,550
All units,robbery in progress.
Bank National.Bomb squad dispatched.

517
00:31:55,870 --> 00:31:56,920
Yeah

518
00:31:57,230 --> 00:31:58,260
<i>It's going down.</i>

519
00:31:59,710 --> 00:32:02,000
Time to grab some cash.

520
00:32:03,540 --> 00:32:05,170
Ricky,we're moving.

521
00:32:07,090 --> 00:32:08,100
Umf--so,am
I.

522
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:21,490
Where have you been ?

523
00:32:53,230 --> 00:32:54,580
You got a walkie ? Thanks.

524
00:32:55,340 --> 00:32:57,030
What did you do ?

525
00:33:01,140 --> 00:33:02,720
Look what you've done.

526
00:33:07,790 --> 00:33:10,300
Cedars-Sinai Hospital. Hurry
please,my father's sick.

527
00:33:10,300 --> 00:33:12,130
Off duty, get out.

528
00:33:12,130 --> 00:33:13,260
It's my heart.

529
00:33:13,260 --> 00:33:14,320
Get out !!

530
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:17,360
He's on his last leg,
move ! Get out,now.

531
00:33:23,860 --> 00:33:26,510
Get out.. -Get to the back of
the cab. All the way to the back.

532
00:33:26,510 --> 00:33:27,850
Open it.

533
00:33:30,510 --> 00:33:31,620
Now get in there. -Ooy.

534
00:33:53,950 --> 00:33:55,610
Lola is so hot.

535
00:33:55,610 --> 00:33:56,680
Good to go.
Hi-yun-ken.

536
00:33:58,690 --> 00:34:00,470
Flag your cab,Mickey.

537
00:34:14,530 --> 00:34:17,240
Keep banging, and I'm
going to set you on fire.

538
00:34:25,450 --> 00:34:27,620
Drive around the block again.

539
00:34:41,150 --> 00:34:42,750
Oh,God. Get out of the way!

540
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:44,490
Get out of the way !!!

541
00:34:49,730 --> 00:34:52,320
<i>Subject exiting opening one.
Sharpshooters,hold your fire.</i>

542
00:34:52,330 --> 00:34:53,390
Please don't shoot.

543
00:34:53,390 --> 00:34:56,130
<i>I'm supposed to be in a cab.
Do not approach,do not shoot.</i>

544
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:57,670
Go,Pops,go.

545
00:34:59,020 --> 00:35:00,580
Here comes our boy.

546
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:04,310
Don't
shoot--

547
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:06,920
I'm supposed to get in a cab,

548
00:35:10,730 --> 00:35:13,640
<i>please. Let that cab
in. Let the taxi through.</i>

549
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:29,960
<i>Air support,keep a visual on the
yellow taxicab in front of the bank.</i>

550
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:31,510
Roger that.

551
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,930
let's roll.

552
00:35:44,030 --> 00:35:46,770
Hi,I'm Ricky-- I
mean,Eduardo. How are you ?

553
00:35:47,940 --> 00:35:50,820
Oh,I'm going to have that
bomb off you in no time,okay ?

554
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:58,660
Pops,uh,I mean, Ricardo ?

555
00:35:58,670 --> 00:36:01,240
I don't--I don't know if it's the red or the
blue. It's the blue, it's always the blue.

556
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:04,170
<i>Well,last time it was
the red. Blue damn it,blue</i>

557
00:36:04,170 --> 00:36:06,310
I'm going red.

558
00:36:06,310 --> 00:36:09,910
I said blue, damn it,blue
!! You want to kill the kid ?

559
00:36:16,750 --> 00:36:18,850
<i>Ooh! The kid lost his load.</i>

560
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:22,040
I'm sorry,man, I always
wanted to do that.

561
00:36:27,890 --> 00:36:32,490
You must be real excited to be riding in
the front of the squad car for a change,huh?

562
00:36:32,580 --> 00:36:37,130
You know,just-- just keep it-- You know
I can actually hear you getting fatter.

563
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:49,910
Suspect is stopped.
Everyone stay behind.

564
00:36:56,440 --> 00:36:57,740
All right, here we go.

565
00:36:57,970 --> 00:37:00,050
10,000 for you,old man.

566
00:37:05,170 --> 00:37:06,940
Now,give me your driver's license.

567
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:10,710
<i>Come on,come on. It's
a terrible picture.</i>

568
00:37:10,510 --> 00:37:15,620
Now,I saved your life, so keep your mouth shut.
And,uh,we know where you live. Okay? Buh-bye.

569
00:37:21,150 --> 00:37:24,540
Don't worry,kid. This'll be over soon.

570
00:37:27,930 --> 00:37:28,940
<i>Clear. Okay,here we go.</i>

571
00:37:29,350 --> 00:37:31,160
All cars stay in close behind us.

572
00:37:31,170 --> 00:37:33,100
Do not give them a reason to detonate.

573
00:37:33,100 --> 00:37:35,950
Get back behind, back behind !!

574
00:37:47,410 --> 00:37:49,570
They won't blow up the money.

575
00:37:49,740 --> 00:37:52,280
But they'd have to be able to see.

576
00:37:57,740 --> 00:38:01,900
I have seven reports from the
Cal Financial Bank robbery.

577
00:38:02,010 --> 00:38:04,970
Seven reports, eight units. Can
you find that missing report ?

578
00:38:11,570 --> 00:38:13,510
They're in one of our cars.

579
00:38:14,130 --> 00:38:17,570
22-5 on 3,
22-5 on 3 !

580
00:38:17,860 --> 00:38:20,410
Why's she want us to switch
to secure channel three ?

581
00:38:21,180 --> 00:38:23,420
I don't know, power trip ?

582
00:38:24,430 --> 00:38:26,070
18 Denny 1 on 3.

583
00:38:26,070 --> 00:38:30,030
We have suspects in one of our units.
Repeat,we have suspects in one of our units.

584
00:38:30,090 --> 00:38:33,120
<i>Air patrol,keep a visual on the cab.</i>

585
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:36,330
Everybody else,on my
count, slam on your brakes.

586
00:38:36,530 --> 00:38:41,190
Ready ?...3,2,1, now !!

587
00:38:45,060 --> 00:38:48,050
Taxi turning,proceeding
southwest on Olympic.

588
00:38:48,780 --> 00:38:50,030
Let's go, get 'em up!

589
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:52,270
<i>You, you, follow the cab. Yes,ma'am.</i>

590
00:38:53,340 --> 00:38:54,540
Get out of the car, show
your hands,nice and easy.

591
00:38:54,620 --> 00:38:56,790
Get 'em up, get 'em
up. O'Brien,over here.

592
00:38:57,550 --> 00:38:58,520
Get out, get out of the car.

593
00:38:59,130 --> 00:39:00,740
Where's the detonator ?

594
00:39:01,820 --> 00:39:03,930
The detonator,find the
detonator. -Here it is.

595
00:39:06,980 --> 00:39:09,420
Got it. Secure.

596
00:39:13,460 --> 00:39:15,320
Pull over in front of the big rig.

597
00:39:27,510 --> 00:39:29,600
keep the change.

598
00:39:45,650 --> 00:39:49,690
<i>Detonator has been found,stop taxi
and apprehend suspects immediately</i>

599
00:39:53,820 --> 00:39:56,640
<i>Driver,stop the engine and
step out of the vehicle.</i>

600
00:39:57,100 --> 00:39:58,950
<i>Get those hands on top of your head.</i>

601
00:39:58,950 --> 00:40:01,270
<i>Step back, step back. On your knees.</i>

602
00:40:01,270 --> 00:40:03,240
<i>Clear. Check the trunk.</i>

603
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:05,050
Clear.

604
00:40:05,610 --> 00:40:10,590
<i>Detective Sykes, it's not the right
cab. I repeat,it's not the right cab.</i>

605
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:12,800
What do you mean it's
not the right cab ?

606
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,470
<i>There's no money, no kid,no bomb.</i>

607
00:43:00,860 --> 00:43:02,310
Big Up To The Bloc Team
