1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,000
(projector sounds)

2
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,833
(soft jazz music)

3
00:00:37,165 --> 00:00:40,540
(upbeat jazz music)

4
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:43,123
(rain falling)

5
00:01:14,268 --> 00:01:16,523
(horn honking)

6
00:01:16,523 --> 00:01:19,068
(thunder rolling)

7
00:01:19,068 --> 00:01:21,487
(horn honking)

8
00:01:21,487 --> 00:01:22,610
- Putz.

9
00:01:22,610 --> 00:01:25,610
(upbeat jazz music)

10
00:01:55,835 --> 00:01:58,418
(horn honking)

11
00:02:02,415 --> 00:02:04,463
- Ah, a paying customer.

12
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:06,503
Hello, Mister.

13
00:02:07,862 --> 00:02:09,430
Oh, what a night, huh?

14
00:02:09,430 --> 00:02:10,670
- Give me two buns.

15
00:02:10,670 --> 00:02:11,860
- Just two?

16
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:13,508
We got a lotta buns.

17
00:02:13,508 --> 00:02:17,175
(speaking foreign language)

18
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:20,760
- [Sam] Just give me two of those.

19
00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:24,060
- Don't I know you?

20
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:25,940
- I used to be where
the medicine store is.

21
00:02:25,940 --> 00:02:27,480
- [Owner] A clothing store?

22
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:29,680
- Sam Kaplan's, ladies lingerie, the best.

23
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:30,983
- I remember.

24
00:02:31,925 --> 00:02:35,033
I couldn't interest you maybe
in a nice piece of cheesecake?

25
00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:38,530
Just kidding.

26
00:02:38,530 --> 00:02:40,200
How about some cookies,
fresh from the oven?

27
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:41,513
- Just ring up the buns.

28
00:02:42,742 --> 00:02:45,810
- You come out in a storm
like this for two measly buns.

29
00:02:45,810 --> 00:02:48,280
Tell me, Mister, are you married?

30
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:49,650
- You think my mother would send me

31
00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:50,900
out on a night like this?

32
00:02:51,765 --> 00:02:54,765
(upbeat jazz music)

33
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:19,390
(horn honking)

34
00:03:19,390 --> 00:03:20,223
(door closing)

35
00:03:20,223 --> 00:03:21,380
- Sam, is that you?

36
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:24,323
- No, it's the Boston Strangler.

37
00:03:24,323 --> 00:03:25,690
- What took you so long?

38
00:03:25,690 --> 00:03:27,630
- What took me so long?

39
00:03:27,630 --> 00:03:29,150
It was such a beautiful night,

40
00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:31,800
I decided to take a stroll on the beach.

41
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:33,950
I felt so good afterwards, I dropped in

42
00:03:33,950 --> 00:03:36,133
at Mrs. Bordnick's for a quickie.

43
00:03:37,130 --> 00:03:39,820
I still had a lot of
energy left, so I went over

44
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:41,970
to the undertaker's and had them cancel

45
00:03:41,970 --> 00:03:44,390
your half of the family plot.

46
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:46,393
Where the hell did you hide my sweater?

47
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,883
- Goodwill came by, they rejected it.

48
00:03:56,590 --> 00:03:58,390
Be careful now, your feet are wet.

49
00:03:58,390 --> 00:04:00,665
Don't track up my carpet.

50
00:04:00,665 --> 00:04:02,460
What is that?

51
00:04:02,460 --> 00:04:03,710
- What does it look like?

52
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:07,310
(water sloshing)

53
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:09,793
It's a fish.

54
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:15,210
I saw it in the tank at the
fish store, and I bought it.

55
00:04:15,210 --> 00:04:17,170
- I didn't tell you to get a fish.

56
00:04:17,170 --> 00:04:18,910
- I didn't get it for you.

57
00:04:18,910 --> 00:04:21,040
I bought it for myself.

58
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,440
A little gift from me to me.

59
00:04:23,393 --> 00:04:24,910
- It's alive.

60
00:04:24,910 --> 00:04:25,810
- Congratulations.

61
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,985
- Take it back.
- I'm not taking it back.

62
00:04:28,985 --> 00:04:30,330
(phone ringing)

63
00:04:30,330 --> 00:04:32,220
- Well if you think
I'm cooking it for you,

64
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:33,080
just forget about it.

65
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:35,180
- I didn't ask you to cook it.

66
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:36,763
I wouldn't let you touch it.

67
00:04:38,262 --> 00:04:39,900
(phone ringing)

68
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:41,350
Uh-huh.

69
00:04:41,350 --> 00:04:44,610
- Sharon, hi, I knew it would be you.

70
00:04:44,610 --> 00:04:46,400
- Is she still coming?

71
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:47,960
- Fine, fine.

72
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:50,870
He's making me crazy, what else is new?

73
00:04:50,870 --> 00:04:53,470
How's Joel, and Melissa?

74
00:04:53,470 --> 00:04:56,460
We're looking forward
to having her tomorrow.

75
00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:59,170
Put it out, you know they give you gas.

76
00:04:59,170 --> 00:05:00,193
- Is she coming?

77
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:03,440
- I'm sorry, honey, I was talking to Sam.

78
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:06,510
No, no, we're looking
forward to having her.

79
00:05:06,510 --> 00:05:08,130
She's a wonderful help.

80
00:05:08,130 --> 00:05:11,130
- I told you, never above six.

81
00:05:11,130 --> 00:05:14,160
I'm not subsidizing the gas company.

82
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,340
Is she coming?

83
00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:16,780
- Of course she's coming.

84
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:17,613
- Okayyyy.

85
00:05:19,050 --> 00:05:22,240
- You and Joel will have
a night on the town.

86
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:25,228
Yes, okay dear, bye-bye.

87
00:05:28,872 --> 00:05:31,372
(gas cooking)

88
00:05:32,212 --> 00:05:34,628
(jazz music)

89
00:05:58,825 --> 00:06:00,800
- Ch ch ch ch ch.

90
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:03,217
(jazz music)

91
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:32,223
- Where's my cigar?

92
00:06:34,650 --> 00:06:36,400
- Where it belongs, in the garbage.

93
00:06:43,813 --> 00:06:45,170
Here you go.

94
00:06:45,170 --> 00:06:46,003
- What's this?

95
00:06:47,170 --> 00:06:49,220
- [Molly] The buns you bought last night.

96
00:06:52,223 --> 00:06:55,813
- What the hell are you giving me here?

97
00:06:55,813 --> 00:06:57,663
- Would you start, we've gotta go.

98
00:06:58,660 --> 00:07:01,183
And, I'm driving.

99
00:07:02,590 --> 00:07:04,910
- If you're talking about
operating a motor vehicle

100
00:07:04,910 --> 00:07:07,700
while I'm in the
passenger seat, forget it.

101
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:08,630
Let me have them.

102
00:07:08,630 --> 00:07:11,510
- Look, my instructor thinks
I'm a very good driver.

103
00:07:11,510 --> 00:07:12,480
- What does he know?

104
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:13,960
Is he gonna pay the insurance claim

105
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:14,890
when you have an accident?

106
00:07:14,890 --> 00:07:18,540
Since I'm free, I can drive
you anywhere you need.

107
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:19,373
Give me those.

108
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:26,303
- What took you so long,
where's the roast beef?

109
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:30,010
- Fisher at the deli counter
tried to sell me an end.

110
00:07:30,010 --> 00:07:31,410
- Give the girl the coupons.

111
00:07:32,467 --> 00:07:35,383
(register beeping)

112
00:07:38,170 --> 00:07:39,610
- What's this?

113
00:07:39,610 --> 00:07:41,173
- Sam, please don't start.

114
00:07:42,155 --> 00:07:45,072
(register beeping)

115
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:47,670
- You're telling me
you're outta toilet paper?

116
00:07:47,670 --> 00:07:49,420
- Just this particular brand.

117
00:07:49,420 --> 00:07:52,090
- [Molly] It's okay, I got
different toilet paper.

118
00:07:52,090 --> 00:07:54,150
- I don't want different toilet paper.

119
00:07:54,150 --> 00:07:56,010
I want my toilet paper.

120
00:07:56,010 --> 00:07:59,010
We're not taking these,
take these off the bill.

121
00:07:59,010 --> 00:08:01,493
- What's the problem today, Mr. Kaplan?

122
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:04,320
- We're out of the
bathroom tissue special.

123
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:06,980
- Just see me when you come
in next week, Mr. Kaplan,

124
00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:08,830
and we'll be stocked up again,

125
00:08:08,830 --> 00:08:10,080
and then we'll honor your coupon.

126
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:12,880
- I'm not supposed to take
a crap until next week?

127
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:14,550
- Stop it, you're embarrassing me.

128
00:08:14,550 --> 00:08:17,100
- If I treated customers like
this when I had my store,

129
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:18,750
I never would have seen them again.

130
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:21,973
42 years in business, I never
pulled a stunt like this.

131
00:08:21,973 --> 00:08:23,880
- Please, just pay the girl.

132
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:25,063
How much do we owe you?

133
00:08:26,873 --> 00:08:29,623
(engine revving)

134
00:08:35,950 --> 00:08:38,270
- All right, this'll just be a minute.

135
00:08:38,270 --> 00:08:39,820
Let's go, baby.

136
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:40,653
Come on.

137
00:08:41,660 --> 00:08:42,493
Going to Papa's.

138
00:08:43,490 --> 00:08:46,183
Get up there and ring the bell, go on.

139
00:08:46,183 --> 00:08:49,100
(doorbell ringing)

140
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:53,248
- Hi, sweetheart.
- Oh, there you are.

141
00:08:56,710 --> 00:08:59,160
- Come on, sweetheart, I
need you in the kitchen.

142
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,540
- All right, so long, Pop.

143
00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:03,160
- Hold on a second.

144
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:04,560
- Pop, I got clients waiting.

145
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:07,200
- The bulb's blown, it'll
take you two seconds, come on.

146
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,303
Come on, give me a break, will you?

147
00:09:12,850 --> 00:09:14,173
I'll get a bulb, up there.

148
00:09:16,790 --> 00:09:18,340
- Joel, you want some coffee?

149
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:19,530
- I can't, I'm not staying, Mom.

150
00:09:19,530 --> 00:09:21,340
I got people waiting in the car.

151
00:09:21,340 --> 00:09:24,200
- [Molly] Why are they waiting in the car?

152
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:25,810
- Look, the thing's full of flies.

153
00:09:25,810 --> 00:09:26,643
- Here.

154
00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:29,290
- This, the bulb's no good.

155
00:09:29,290 --> 00:09:30,200
- What are you talking about?

156
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:31,650
It's practically brand new.

157
00:09:31,650 --> 00:09:32,483
(bulb rattling)

158
00:09:32,483 --> 00:09:34,553
You can't tell by shaking,
put it in, put it in.

159
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:41,070
Here, here, give me that.

160
00:09:44,130 --> 00:09:45,403
Must be the fixture.

161
00:09:47,550 --> 00:09:49,080
Ai.

162
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:50,600
Oh boy, oh boy, oh boy, okay.

163
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:51,670
Take this one.

164
00:09:51,670 --> 00:09:54,930
- Ow, it's only 40 watts,
Pop, it's too weak.

165
00:09:54,930 --> 00:09:57,373
Pop, please, I got clients waiting.

166
00:09:58,675 --> 00:10:00,375
- I got more bulbs in the kitchen.

167
00:10:01,610 --> 00:10:03,613
- Joel, your friends are here.

168
00:10:03,613 --> 00:10:05,070
- Maaaa.

169
00:10:05,070 --> 00:10:05,903
- Sit down.

170
00:10:05,903 --> 00:10:07,740
I'm sorry, this is all just
gonna be one minute more.

171
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:10,545
- [Molly] I felt terrible
with you waiting outside.

172
00:10:10,545 --> 00:10:12,928
Now what can I offer you,
some coffee, some cake?

173
00:10:12,928 --> 00:10:14,010
- That's very nice of you.

174
00:10:14,010 --> 00:10:16,120
- The clients, how do you do?

175
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:16,953
- Pop.

176
00:10:16,953 --> 00:10:18,370
- So you're buying a house.

177
00:10:18,370 --> 00:10:19,203
- [Joel] Pop!

178
00:10:19,203 --> 00:10:21,280
- Real estate is a wonderful investment,

179
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:22,790
if you know what you're doing.

180
00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:26,450
I picked up this house
in 1955 for $17,000.

181
00:10:26,450 --> 00:10:29,730
Today, Joel tells me I could
get for this house at least--

182
00:10:29,730 --> 00:10:31,070
- 10 times that.

183
00:10:31,070 --> 00:10:33,290
- 10 times what I paid.
- That's right, Pop.

184
00:10:33,290 --> 00:10:35,320
- As a buyer, you gotta ask yourself,

185
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:37,560
what do they know that I don't?

186
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:38,990
Why are they selling?

187
00:10:38,990 --> 00:10:39,823
- Pop.

188
00:10:39,823 --> 00:10:42,210
- One, an old house is like a used car.

189
00:10:42,210 --> 00:10:44,610
Major expenses are just around the corner.

190
00:10:44,610 --> 00:10:46,110
You have to examine everything.

191
00:10:46,110 --> 00:10:48,250
Two, they're speculating.

192
00:10:48,250 --> 00:10:49,543
The hell with them.

193
00:10:49,543 --> 00:10:50,860
- Okay, done.

194
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:52,600
- Three, the hidden costs,

195
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:55,690
transfer taxes, escrow fees,
the lawyers, inspectors.

196
00:10:55,690 --> 00:10:57,410
They get you coming,
and they get you going.

197
00:10:57,410 --> 00:10:58,600
- We're going now.

198
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:00,950
- And agents, oh, that's another story.

199
00:11:00,950 --> 00:11:02,590
Some of them are just gangsters.

200
00:11:02,590 --> 00:11:04,228
You're lucky with my
Joel, he's a good boy.

201
00:11:04,228 --> 00:11:05,630
You don't have to worry about a thing.

202
00:11:05,630 --> 00:11:06,868
- Thank you, bye.

203
00:11:06,868 --> 00:11:07,810
- [Sam] Joel will take good care of you.

204
00:11:07,810 --> 00:11:10,040
He's honest, and he knows real estate.

205
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:12,090
- Bye, Pop.
- All right.

206
00:11:12,090 --> 00:11:14,440
- Wasting his time,
they're not serious buyers.

207
00:11:16,830 --> 00:11:18,120
- Sorry about that.

208
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:22,933
- Yeah, Charles, listen, it's me again.

209
00:11:22,933 --> 00:11:26,093
Just came in, 56, I wanna go to 56.

210
00:11:26,990 --> 00:11:27,940
I'll take a chance.

211
00:11:29,193 --> 00:11:31,125
(engine starting)

212
00:11:31,125 --> 00:11:32,825
They're dumb but they're not dead, right?

213
00:11:32,825 --> 00:11:34,977
(laughing)

214
00:11:34,977 --> 00:11:36,330
(car beeping)

215
00:11:36,330 --> 00:11:39,555
Yeah, yeah, we're house hunting.

216
00:11:39,555 --> 00:11:40,600
Yeah, me and Tracy.

217
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:44,020
- She popped the clasp
on her lizard-skin purse.

218
00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:47,370
Her eyes sparkled like
moonlight on a frozen lake.

219
00:11:47,370 --> 00:11:50,630
She smiled at Mister Fister,
she reached out her bony hand

220
00:11:50,630 --> 00:11:52,130
toward the money that he held.

221
00:11:53,090 --> 00:11:54,317
Do you get it?

222
00:11:54,317 --> 00:11:57,480
- Yeah, so, um,

223
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:59,910
the mean lady's trying to fool Mr. Fist,

224
00:11:59,910 --> 00:12:03,430
and Mr. Fist knows that she's lying.

225
00:12:03,430 --> 00:12:06,860
- Right, and maybe she has a gun

226
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:08,433
in her lizard-skin purse.

227
00:12:10,510 --> 00:12:12,293
- I have to go pee,
Papa, don't read ahead.

228
00:12:12,293 --> 00:12:14,663
- Okay, hurry up.

229
00:12:22,857 --> 00:12:25,850
(screaming)

230
00:12:25,850 --> 00:12:28,300
- Oh, you scared me.

231
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:30,830
I thought you hurt yourself.

232
00:12:30,830 --> 00:12:34,280
Ohhh, honey, honey, oh.

233
00:12:35,503 --> 00:12:37,623
- [Sam] So, you found the shark?

234
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:42,040
Melissa, honey, he's just a fish.

235
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:43,870
- You said you gave it back.

236
00:12:43,870 --> 00:12:46,310
- [Sam] I never said anything of the kind.

237
00:12:46,310 --> 00:12:48,660
- You're scaring her, it's okay.

238
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:51,350
- Look, he's smiling at you.

239
00:12:51,350 --> 00:12:52,223
- [Molly] Sam!

240
00:12:53,818 --> 00:12:55,440
- Nana, I have to pee bad.

241
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:58,620
- All right, honey, you
use our bathroom, okay?

242
00:12:58,620 --> 00:13:00,800
Hurry up, go on.

243
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:02,090
You oughta be ashamed.

244
00:13:02,090 --> 00:13:02,923
- Hello.

245
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:06,220
You guys home?

246
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:08,440
- Get that thing out of here now.

247
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:11,210
- The fish stays.

248
00:13:11,210 --> 00:13:13,185
- If you don't get rid of it, I will.

249
00:13:13,185 --> 00:13:14,603
- The fish stays!

250
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:20,313
Nobody's gonna hurt you, pal.

251
00:13:21,368 --> 00:13:23,535
(humming)

252
00:13:27,310 --> 00:13:28,143
- Hi.

253
00:13:30,932 --> 00:13:32,120
(drawer slamming)

254
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:33,173
- Where's my lighter?

255
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:35,453
- Hi.

256
00:13:38,790 --> 00:13:40,440
- Look where the hell she put it.

257
00:13:51,270 --> 00:13:53,250
- Hey, where's the fire?

258
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:54,520
- Do you hear how she talks to me?

259
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:56,100
And in front of the child.

260
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:57,290
- If you're running away from home,

261
00:13:57,290 --> 00:13:58,920
you should bring a change of underwear.

262
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:00,210
- Day in and day out, the same thing,

263
00:14:00,210 --> 00:14:01,870
get me this, get me that.

264
00:14:01,870 --> 00:14:04,033
Throw this out, throw that out.

265
00:14:04,033 --> 00:14:04,865
What does she want from me?

266
00:14:04,865 --> 00:14:05,800
- Take it easy, Sam.

267
00:14:07,178 --> 00:14:09,633
- I don't know half the
time if I'm coming or going.

268
00:14:10,930 --> 00:14:11,980
- Can we go home now?

269
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:14,393
Come on.

270
00:14:18,623 --> 00:14:21,540
(soft piano music)

271
00:14:27,015 --> 00:14:29,357
(chattering)

272
00:14:29,357 --> 00:14:31,773
(soft music)

273
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:41,030
- You know, I have never
seen you so relaxed.

274
00:14:41,030 --> 00:14:44,150
You can be very attractive
when you're not miserable.

275
00:14:44,150 --> 00:14:44,983
- And why not?

276
00:14:44,983 --> 00:14:47,240
We're young, we're free in an attached,

277
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:49,870
totally obligated sort of way.

278
00:14:49,870 --> 00:14:51,680
I closed a deal today.

279
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:53,550
I feel, I feel great.

280
00:14:53,550 --> 00:14:55,630
- I'm so happy for you, baby.

281
00:14:55,630 --> 00:14:57,770
God, I love this place.

282
00:14:57,770 --> 00:14:59,800
Remember you proposed
to me here at Adolpho's,

283
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:01,992
right at this table,
right by the fireplace?

284
00:15:01,992 --> 00:15:03,300
- Of course I do.

285
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:05,660
- He was two classes ahead
of me in high school,

286
00:15:05,660 --> 00:15:08,360
and he was really good-looking.

287
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:09,610
- Papa was good-looking?

288
00:15:09,610 --> 00:15:12,240
- Oh yeah, when he was
young, he was very handsome.

289
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:13,850
All the girls thought so.

290
00:15:13,850 --> 00:15:16,060
- But he never paid any attention to you.

291
00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:17,033
- That's right.

292
00:15:18,020 --> 00:15:19,770
And we were from different backgrounds,

293
00:15:19,770 --> 00:15:22,893
and in those days that
made it more difficult.

294
00:15:22,893 --> 00:15:23,725
- And then one day?

295
00:15:23,725 --> 00:15:26,620
- And then one day he brought
me a box of chocolates,

296
00:15:26,620 --> 00:15:28,483
and I knew he liked me.

297
00:15:28,483 --> 00:15:31,038
- You never saw a box of
chocolates disappear so fast.

298
00:15:31,038 --> 00:15:32,298
(laughing)

299
00:15:32,298 --> 00:15:33,130
- Here.

300
00:15:35,185 --> 00:15:36,890
We were both very shy.

301
00:15:36,890 --> 00:15:38,820
In fact, the first time we
were ever alone together

302
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:40,070
was on our wedding night.

303
00:15:41,052 --> 00:15:41,920
- What are you putting in her head?

304
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:44,430
She's six years old, for God's sakes.

305
00:15:44,430 --> 00:15:46,120
- You were a blushing bride.

306
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:48,110
You told me so, Nana.

307
00:15:48,110 --> 00:15:49,150
- What did we know?

308
00:15:49,150 --> 00:15:50,920
We were a couple of kids.

309
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:53,117
- You're not gonna wear that jacket?

310
00:15:53,117 --> 00:15:53,950
- Why not?

311
00:15:53,950 --> 00:15:55,600
I like this jacket, what's wrong with it?

312
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:57,343
- Nothing, fine, wear it.

313
00:15:59,325 --> 00:16:02,340
- Can I wear some lipstick tonight, Nana?

314
00:16:02,340 --> 00:16:04,257
- Listen, I wanna talk about something.

315
00:16:04,257 --> 00:16:05,380
- Uh-oh.

316
00:16:05,380 --> 00:16:06,850
- I think it's time for Melissa to have

317
00:16:06,850 --> 00:16:08,530
a little brother or sister.

318
00:16:08,530 --> 00:16:11,580
I mean, you're doing fine,
and they say that I can teach

319
00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:14,550
at home after the baby comes,
and we can afford it now.

320
00:16:14,550 --> 00:16:16,960
And I don't think it's a good
idea to let too many years

321
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:17,978
pass between--

322
00:16:19,330 --> 00:16:21,403
What, we always said we wanted two kids.

323
00:16:22,330 --> 00:16:23,520
- That was before we had one.

324
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:24,878
- Come on, be serious.

325
00:16:24,878 --> 00:16:25,712
- I am serious.

326
00:16:25,712 --> 00:16:27,100
- We're not getting any younger.

327
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:28,380
- What is the rush?

328
00:16:28,380 --> 00:16:29,900
Do you see any gray hairs?

329
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:31,890
- Of course you don't have gray hairs.

330
00:16:31,890 --> 00:16:34,060
Except for maybe those two right there.

331
00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:35,510
Come on, that's not what I meant.

332
00:16:35,510 --> 00:16:36,690
- Well what did you mean?

333
00:16:36,690 --> 00:16:39,038
I'm 31 years old, you're 30.

334
00:16:39,038 --> 00:16:40,423
I am not getting old.

335
00:16:40,423 --> 00:16:42,250
- What is the matter with you?

336
00:16:42,250 --> 00:16:43,785
- Nothing.

337
00:16:43,785 --> 00:16:47,712
I just, I don't wanna talk about it, okay?

338
00:16:47,712 --> 00:16:49,150
- Fine.

339
00:16:49,150 --> 00:16:51,883
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, misdeal.

340
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:56,430
- Bea, are you bringing anybody
to my anniversary party?

341
00:16:56,430 --> 00:16:58,780
- Bea, you have a friend?

342
00:16:58,780 --> 00:16:59,873
- I'd rather not talk about it.

343
00:16:59,873 --> 00:17:02,680
- What do you mean you'd
rather not talk about it?

344
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:03,730
Talk about it.

345
00:17:03,730 --> 00:17:06,573
- There is somebody, but I
don't wanna rush into anything.

346
00:17:06,573 --> 00:17:09,335
- I mean, it's only been, what, six years?

347
00:17:09,335 --> 00:17:11,140
(laughing)

348
00:17:11,140 --> 00:17:12,760
Listen, listen to this.

349
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:16,270
You know why Jewish
princesses have crow's feet.

350
00:17:16,270 --> 00:17:18,548
Because they say you want me to do what?

351
00:17:18,548 --> 00:17:20,395
(laughing)

352
00:17:20,395 --> 00:17:23,483
- Don't worry, Abe, we're
not talking about you.

353
00:17:23,483 --> 00:17:25,733
(laughing)

354
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:30,380
- Is anybody else hot in here besides me?

355
00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:32,058
- Okay, full house.

356
00:17:32,058 --> 00:17:33,508
- Get outta here.
- Come on.

357
00:17:34,603 --> 00:17:37,020
(chattering)

358
00:17:43,605 --> 00:17:45,605
- We need more ice, Sam.

359
00:17:47,050 --> 00:17:49,550
Sam, you need more ice.

360
00:17:49,550 --> 00:17:50,383
- I heard you.

361
00:17:53,722 --> 00:17:56,138
(chattering)

362
00:18:05,453 --> 00:18:06,885
I said I would get it.

363
00:18:06,885 --> 00:18:09,783
- No, excuse me!

364
00:18:09,783 --> 00:18:12,200
(chattering)

365
00:18:15,055 --> 00:18:16,450
- [Bernie] How's your boy, Morris?

366
00:18:16,450 --> 00:18:19,620
- Don't ask, he's giving
Frieda and me such grief.

367
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:22,280
Fordham Law, graduated
top third of his class,

368
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:23,680
has his pick of jobs anywhere.

369
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:25,380
He gives it all up, for what?

370
00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:28,282
To become a musician, to follow his dream.

371
00:18:28,282 --> 00:18:29,130
- I gotta go to the can, deal me out.

372
00:18:29,130 --> 00:18:31,230
- One night last week, I go to a nightclub

373
00:18:32,085 --> 00:18:32,918
where he's playing, the
place is pitch black,

374
00:18:34,220 --> 00:18:35,460
but everybody's wearing sunglasses.

375
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:37,600
But let me tell you
something that happened.

376
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:39,187
I was approached.

377
00:18:39,187 --> 00:18:40,680
- Oh, here we go again.

378
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:43,040
- So this girl comes up
to me, and she talks to me

379
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:44,200
like she thinks she knows me.

380
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:45,870
You know, very familiar.

381
00:18:45,870 --> 00:18:47,660
She asks me what I'm drinking.

382
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:49,240
- Sounds like a waitress to me.

383
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:51,280
- So I ask her, does
she wanna have a drink?

384
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:54,520
And she says, I'm not allowed
to drink while I'm on the job.

385
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:55,970
- It's a waitress.

386
00:18:55,970 --> 00:18:58,560
- Don't you get it, she's
suggesting that maybe after,

387
00:18:58,560 --> 00:18:59,650
when her shift is over--

388
00:18:59,650 --> 00:19:01,170
- You guys playing cards or what?

389
00:19:01,170 --> 00:19:04,655
- [Morris] It dawns on me why
everyone's wearing sunglasses.

390
00:19:04,655 --> 00:19:05,775
You been on the road, Bernie

391
00:19:05,775 --> 00:19:07,375
you know what I'm talking about.

392
00:19:09,410 --> 00:19:11,780
- Sam, would you open the window, please?

393
00:19:11,780 --> 00:19:13,290
- Leave it shut.

394
00:19:13,290 --> 00:19:14,260
- Well then put out the cigar.

395
00:19:14,260 --> 00:19:16,340
The smoke is bothering Frieda.

396
00:19:16,340 --> 00:19:17,380
- I don't hear anyone else complaining.

397
00:19:17,380 --> 00:19:18,480
- Bothering you?
- No.

398
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:19,530
- Bothering you?
- No.

399
00:19:19,530 --> 00:19:20,490
- Leave it shut.

400
00:19:20,490 --> 00:19:22,850
- I don't like the smoke either.

401
00:19:22,850 --> 00:19:24,400
- Stay out of this, Rose.

402
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:25,840
- That's right, stay the hell out of it.

403
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:27,450
- Don't talk to my wife like that.

404
00:19:27,450 --> 00:19:29,640
- Molly, let it alone.

405
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:31,530
The smoke isn't that bad, Molly.

406
00:19:31,530 --> 00:19:34,413
- This is my house, Bea, I can't breathe.

407
00:19:36,580 --> 00:19:38,210
- What do you think you're doing?

408
00:19:38,210 --> 00:19:40,860
- Nobody can breathe in
here with all of this smoke.

409
00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:42,550
- I didn't put in air conditioning for you

410
00:19:42,550 --> 00:19:44,760
to cool the whole goddamn world.

411
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:46,080
- Hey, hey, hey.

412
00:19:48,290 --> 00:19:50,355
Now, you see, you had
to open your mouth, huh?

413
00:19:50,355 --> 00:19:52,050
You had to open your mouth.

414
00:19:52,050 --> 00:19:54,293
- What did I say, I didn't
say anything so terrible.

415
00:19:59,788 --> 00:20:02,538
- He's got a fish in his bathtub.

416
00:20:04,363 --> 00:20:06,287
- I hate that stinking crap.

417
00:20:06,287 --> 00:20:07,120
Give me that.

418
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:08,150
- There's a fish in your bathtub.

419
00:20:08,150 --> 00:20:09,270
- And your cigars don't stink?

420
00:20:09,270 --> 00:20:10,370
- Sam, come on, sit down.

421
00:20:10,370 --> 00:20:12,065
- Who asked you, mind your own business.

422
00:20:12,065 --> 00:20:13,570
- Did you know there's
a fish in your bathtub?

423
00:20:13,570 --> 00:20:14,840
- What's it to you?

424
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:16,210
- Ask him how it got there.

425
00:20:16,210 --> 00:20:17,460
- Oh for Christ sake.

426
00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:20,040
- Yeah, go ahead, ask
him how it got there.

427
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:22,260
Ask him, he brought it
home in a plastic bag

428
00:20:22,260 --> 00:20:24,820
from somewhere, he
doesn't even remember why.

429
00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:26,130
- And you're so perfect.

430
00:20:26,130 --> 00:20:27,560
- Is that what you expect, perfection?

431
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:28,810
- I expect things to be done right.

432
00:20:28,810 --> 00:20:30,440
- You don't know what that means.

433
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:32,020
Nothing is ever right for you.

434
00:20:32,020 --> 00:20:33,270
- That's enough, shut up.

435
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:36,470
- Don't tell me to shut up.

436
00:20:36,470 --> 00:20:38,030
No one can please you.

437
00:20:38,030 --> 00:20:39,860
You couldn't keep help at the shop.

438
00:20:39,860 --> 00:20:43,730
You drove them crazy, like
you're driving me crazy.

439
00:20:43,730 --> 00:20:44,840
What's the matter with you?

440
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:45,960
- Shut up!

441
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:47,160
- [Molly] What do you want from me?

442
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:48,020
- [Sam] Shut up!

443
00:20:48,020 --> 00:20:49,130
- You are miserable.

444
00:20:49,130 --> 00:20:52,910
- Shut up, shut up, shut up!

445
00:20:52,910 --> 00:20:53,823
Shut up!

446
00:20:58,050 --> 00:21:00,883
(soft jazz music)

447
00:21:12,870 --> 00:21:15,377
(door closing)

448
00:21:15,377 --> 00:21:18,210
(soft jazz music)

449
00:21:38,410 --> 00:21:39,510
- Come on, sweetheart.

450
00:21:42,707 --> 00:21:44,118
- Ma, what's going on?

451
00:21:44,118 --> 00:21:45,413
- Get in the car, honey.

452
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:51,393
- Pop?

453
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:54,490
What the hell is going on here?

454
00:21:54,490 --> 00:21:57,040
- You tell me, you know
as much about it as I do.

455
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:58,923
- What's with Ma and the suitcase?

456
00:22:00,310 --> 00:22:02,260
- If she wants to go, fine.

457
00:22:02,260 --> 00:22:03,750
She can go to hell, for all I care.

458
00:22:03,750 --> 00:22:05,250
- Pop, cut it out.

459
00:22:05,250 --> 00:22:06,150
What happened?

460
00:22:06,150 --> 00:22:09,350
- Look, you're a busy man,
don't let me keep you.

461
00:22:09,350 --> 00:22:10,893
- I, I, I can't believe this.

462
00:22:10,893 --> 00:22:12,830
(horn honking)

463
00:22:12,830 --> 00:22:15,890
Okay, I'll call you when I get home.

464
00:22:15,890 --> 00:22:17,468
- It's a free country!

465
00:22:18,498 --> 00:22:21,082
(door closing)

466
00:22:27,728 --> 00:22:30,060
- Come on, Nana, Nana's
having a sleepover.

467
00:22:30,060 --> 00:22:31,793
- Oh, how nice.

468
00:22:33,782 --> 00:22:36,532
(birds chirping)

469
00:22:44,068 --> 00:22:45,800
(machine beeping)

470
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:48,640
- [Tracy] This message is for Joel Kaplan.

471
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:50,950
This is Tracy Loughlin.

472
00:22:50,950 --> 00:22:53,680
We're both so excited about the house.

473
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:57,420
There are some things I need
to talk over with you, Joel.

474
00:22:57,420 --> 00:23:02,143
My private number is 387-2481.

475
00:23:02,980 --> 00:23:04,260
Call me.

476
00:23:04,260 --> 00:23:07,093
(machine beeping)

477
00:23:07,940 --> 00:23:11,940
(machine rewinding and beeping)

478
00:23:16,873 --> 00:23:18,707
- Ho, well, here I am.

479
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:21,470
- It's okay.

480
00:23:21,470 --> 00:23:24,590
Sometimes people just need
a break from each other.

481
00:23:24,590 --> 00:23:25,870
- Yeah, I know.

482
00:23:25,870 --> 00:23:27,330
- I brought you an extra blanket.

483
00:23:27,330 --> 00:23:29,360
- Oh, thank you.

484
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:31,150
- You know where everything is.

485
00:23:31,150 --> 00:23:33,520
We're downstairs, so come
down when you're ready.

486
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:34,353
- Okay.

487
00:23:36,292 --> 00:23:38,708
(jazz music)

488
00:23:43,015 --> 00:23:45,683
(phone ringing)

489
00:23:46,887 --> 00:23:47,980
- Hello.

490
00:23:47,980 --> 00:23:50,373
- Hello, hi, Tracy, it's Joel Kaplan.

491
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:55,730
- [Tracy] Joel, I'm glad you called.

492
00:23:55,730 --> 00:23:57,820
- So, how are you, I mean, how are you?

493
00:23:57,820 --> 00:23:59,833
- [Tracy] Well I'm just fine.

494
00:24:01,540 --> 00:24:05,418
- Uh, do you have some
questions about the house?

495
00:24:05,418 --> 00:24:06,360
- Yes, I do.

496
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:08,103
Could we get together?

497
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:09,980
- Is there a problem?

498
00:24:09,980 --> 00:24:11,490
- [Tracy] No, no, nothing's wrong.

499
00:24:11,490 --> 00:24:13,828
It's just I have some last-minute things.

500
00:24:13,828 --> 00:24:17,580
I'd really appreciate it
if you could help me out.

501
00:24:17,580 --> 00:24:19,858
- Sure, um,

502
00:24:19,858 --> 00:24:21,645
is there anything you'd like me to bring?

503
00:24:21,645 --> 00:24:23,470
(giggling)

504
00:24:23,470 --> 00:24:25,543
- Well, I'll leave that up to you.

505
00:24:26,830 --> 00:24:30,723
Let's say Adolpho's, one
o'clock, you know Adolpho's?

506
00:24:31,665 --> 00:24:32,670
- Yeah, yeah, that's fine.

507
00:24:32,670 --> 00:24:34,610
- [Tracy] Great, I'll see you then.

508
00:24:34,610 --> 00:24:35,443
- Okay, bye.

509
00:24:36,810 --> 00:24:38,100
- What are you doing in there?

510
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:39,858
- Just talking to a client.

511
00:24:39,858 --> 00:24:41,810
- Oh ho, big secret stuff, huh?

512
00:24:41,810 --> 00:24:44,603
- No, I just left her number
here in the car, that's all.

513
00:24:46,742 --> 00:24:49,658
(soft piano music)

514
00:24:56,390 --> 00:25:00,490
- Aw, he was way outta line,
the way he yelled at her.

515
00:25:00,490 --> 00:25:02,190
- He didn't yell, he screamed.

516
00:25:02,190 --> 00:25:03,523
- Oh, so he screamed.

517
00:25:03,523 --> 00:25:05,250
Did you ever scream at your wife?

518
00:25:05,250 --> 00:25:08,070
- Never, I never screamed at my wife.

519
00:25:08,070 --> 00:25:09,350
She screams at me.

520
00:25:09,350 --> 00:25:11,530
(laughing)

521
00:25:11,530 --> 00:25:14,895
(traffic passing)

522
00:25:14,895 --> 00:25:18,177
Well, well, well, look
who's here, Mr. Hospitality.

523
00:25:18,177 --> 00:25:19,850
Well, you put on quite a show, you know.

524
00:25:19,850 --> 00:25:21,560
- So long as you enjoyed yourself.

525
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:22,830
I'll have salami and eggs.

526
00:25:22,830 --> 00:25:25,803
- Hey, I'm fine, but thanks for asking.

527
00:25:25,803 --> 00:25:27,695
- Hey, Sam, you got a cigar?

528
00:25:27,695 --> 00:25:29,945
(laughing)

529
00:25:32,050 --> 00:25:34,468
- Do me a favor, Katz, go fuck yourself.

530
00:25:34,468 --> 00:25:36,160
(laughing)

531
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:37,033
- You okay?

532
00:25:38,047 --> 00:25:40,180
I thought you were gonna burst
a blood vessel last night.

533
00:25:40,180 --> 00:25:43,430
- Sam, you gonna take that
fish for a walk in the park?

534
00:25:43,430 --> 00:25:44,960
- You can't walk a fish.

535
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,740
- You gotta drag a fish.

536
00:25:46,740 --> 00:25:48,990
(laughing)

537
00:25:50,450 --> 00:25:52,100
- Do you have any idea
what's going on here?

538
00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:54,750
Do you have any idea what's
going on in my life right now?

539
00:25:54,750 --> 00:25:56,508
- Sam, Sam, take it easy.

540
00:25:56,508 --> 00:25:58,413
You're going through
something, that's all.

541
00:25:58,413 --> 00:26:00,053
- You all make me sick.

542
00:26:02,330 --> 00:26:05,650
- Hey, hey, what am I gonna do with this?

543
00:26:05,650 --> 00:26:07,545
- Feed it to the vultures.

544
00:26:07,545 --> 00:26:12,545
Here, here's for all of them.

545
00:26:17,573 --> 00:26:19,123
- [Katz] Calling us vultures?

546
00:26:20,230 --> 00:26:21,720
- [Morris] It's the carp
thing, the fish thing.

547
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:24,125
You never should have said
that thing about the fish.

548
00:26:24,125 --> 00:26:25,528
- What do you do this for?

549
00:26:25,528 --> 00:26:27,170
You got a pension, you'll catch

550
00:26:27,170 --> 00:26:28,643
pneumonia on a day like this.

551
00:26:28,643 --> 00:26:29,730
- It keeps me busy, and besides,

552
00:26:29,730 --> 00:26:30,873
the exercise is good for me.

553
00:26:30,873 --> 00:26:32,820
You should try it some time.

554
00:26:32,820 --> 00:26:35,230
Listen, when we get to the
florist, go inside to use

555
00:26:35,230 --> 00:26:36,930
the telephone, Rudy won't mind.

556
00:26:36,930 --> 00:26:38,940
- I'm not calling, I wouldn't
give her the satisfaction.

557
00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:40,330
- What is it with you?

558
00:26:40,330 --> 00:26:41,590
Pride, or are you just plain stupid?

559
00:26:41,590 --> 00:26:42,610
- I'm telling you, she'll be back.

560
00:26:42,610 --> 00:26:44,013
What else is she gonna do?

561
00:26:44,013 --> 00:26:45,710
- How you doing, Milo, morning, Sam.

562
00:26:45,710 --> 00:26:46,800
- Hi ya.

563
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:48,110
- No windows today, I guess.

564
00:26:48,110 --> 00:26:50,810
- Well, give it a few
minutes, it may clear up.

565
00:26:50,810 --> 00:26:52,788
- Sam, where'd you get that jacket?

566
00:26:52,788 --> 00:26:53,720
(laughing)

567
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:54,553
- I mean, it's been two hours already.

568
00:26:54,553 --> 00:26:56,210
What is she, what is she doing up there?

569
00:26:56,210 --> 00:26:58,110
- Would you sit down?

570
00:26:58,110 --> 00:27:00,670
This whole thing'll blow
over, she'll calm down.

571
00:27:00,670 --> 00:27:03,280
- I'm telling you, there's
something very wrong here.

572
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:05,470
- Your dad will call and apologize.

573
00:27:05,470 --> 00:27:06,303
- Dad, never.

574
00:27:06,303 --> 00:27:07,790
- Of course he will.

575
00:27:07,790 --> 00:27:10,440
- Listen, she's left him
and she's moved in with us.

576
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:13,580
- Look, arguing is like,
it's like a hobby with them.

577
00:27:13,580 --> 00:27:14,690
It doesn't mean anything.

578
00:27:14,690 --> 00:27:16,340
- This isn't just some little argument.

579
00:27:16,340 --> 00:27:19,290
These are my parents, for God
sake, these are crazy people.

580
00:27:22,930 --> 00:27:24,290
- Anybody like a cup of tea?

581
00:27:24,290 --> 00:27:27,650
- Ma, would you please
sit down and tell me

582
00:27:27,650 --> 00:27:29,810
what the hell is going on here?

583
00:27:29,810 --> 00:27:32,730
- Listen, kids, if I had
any place else to go,

584
00:27:32,730 --> 00:27:33,790
I wouldn't trouble you this way.

585
00:27:33,790 --> 00:27:34,890
The last thing I want is for you

586
00:27:34,890 --> 00:27:36,390
to be upset because of me.

587
00:27:36,390 --> 00:27:38,710
- This is ridiculous, I'm
phoning Pop right now,

588
00:27:38,710 --> 00:27:39,798
and you're gonna settle this.

589
00:27:39,798 --> 00:27:41,310
- No, I won't talk to him.

590
00:27:41,310 --> 00:27:43,260
- Joel, hang up the phone.

591
00:27:43,260 --> 00:27:44,420
- You wanna know what it is?

592
00:27:44,420 --> 00:27:45,253
- No.

593
00:27:45,253 --> 00:27:48,278
- I'll tell you exactly,
it's religious differences.

594
00:27:48,278 --> 00:27:49,112
- What?

595
00:27:49,112 --> 00:27:50,760
- To the day they died, her family never

596
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:53,130
got over the fact that she married me.

597
00:27:53,130 --> 00:27:54,700
They must have poisoned her mind.

598
00:27:54,700 --> 00:27:56,370
- Boy, that's dumb even for you.

599
00:27:56,370 --> 00:27:57,373
- Oh, yeah?

600
00:27:59,770 --> 00:28:02,630
Well, think about it.

601
00:28:02,630 --> 00:28:04,173
- She converted, didn't she?

602
00:28:04,173 --> 00:28:06,520
- (chuckles) That wore off.

603
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:08,360
- That's ridiculous.

604
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:09,523
- I see her talking to
Father Mularkey all the time.

605
00:28:10,872 --> 00:28:12,560
- Malachy, Jesus.

606
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:14,140
- I wouldn't be surprised
if she sneaks off

607
00:28:14,140 --> 00:28:15,675
to Mass when I'm not looking.

608
00:28:15,675 --> 00:28:16,508
(door opening)

609
00:28:16,508 --> 00:28:18,690
Sh, listen, huh?

610
00:28:18,690 --> 00:28:20,290
What did I tell you, she's back.

611
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:23,193
- [Ruthie] Daddy?

612
00:28:23,193 --> 00:28:24,027
- Oh.

613
00:28:26,060 --> 00:28:28,700
- Well, you've really done it this time.

614
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:30,140
I don't suppose that you've been able

615
00:28:30,140 --> 00:28:31,710
to talk any sense into him.

616
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:33,320
- Hello, Ruthie, dear.

617
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:34,320
- No, of course not.

618
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:38,463
Look at this place, Daddy,
could you clean up a little?

619
00:28:38,463 --> 00:28:39,960
- A little dirt never hurt anybody.

620
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:41,850
Relax, you'll live longer.

621
00:28:41,850 --> 00:28:43,430
- Hey, I'm gonna run along home now.

622
00:28:43,430 --> 00:28:45,803
You guys have a nice conversation.

623
00:28:46,650 --> 00:28:48,180
And, Ruthie, don't worry about anything.

624
00:28:48,180 --> 00:28:49,890
It's all gonna turn out fine.

625
00:28:49,890 --> 00:28:50,780
(scoffing)

626
00:28:50,780 --> 00:28:52,470
Ruthie, Ruthie.

627
00:28:52,470 --> 00:28:53,910
Boy, it seems like I
haven't seen you in ages.

628
00:28:53,910 --> 00:28:55,818
When did you get so grown-up?

629
00:28:55,818 --> 00:28:57,160
- You know, it's really
sweet that you say that to me

630
00:28:57,160 --> 00:28:58,710
every time you see me, Milo,

631
00:28:58,710 --> 00:29:00,910
but I'm hardly a little girl anymore.

632
00:29:00,910 --> 00:29:03,470
- You'll always be sweet 16 to me, dear.

633
00:29:03,470 --> 00:29:05,043
And you I'll talk to tomorrow.

634
00:29:06,747 --> 00:29:10,290
- Daddy, Daddy, Daddy, Daddy, Daddy.

635
00:29:10,290 --> 00:29:11,240
What are you doing?

636
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:14,203
I begged you to get some therapy.

637
00:29:15,550 --> 00:29:17,400
- Can we skip the touchy feely stuff, huh?

638
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:19,290
- She's not coming back.

639
00:29:19,290 --> 00:29:20,940
She's just not coming back.

640
00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:21,980
- It'll blow over.

641
00:29:21,980 --> 00:29:23,840
- God forbid that you admit that you had

642
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:25,630
anything to do with this.

643
00:29:25,630 --> 00:29:28,110
She's made a decision now,
and she's not coming back.

644
00:29:28,110 --> 00:29:29,770
- Fine, me neither.

645
00:29:29,770 --> 00:29:31,020
Now you listen to me, Ruthie.

646
00:29:31,020 --> 00:29:33,870
I know what everyone thinks,
oh poor her, what a saint,

647
00:29:33,870 --> 00:29:35,340
putting up with that son of a bitch.

648
00:29:35,340 --> 00:29:36,720
Well that's her side.

649
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:38,840
I put up with plenty myself.

650
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:41,635
She wants to stay away,
fine, the hell with her.

651
00:29:41,635 --> 00:29:42,468
- I can't listen to this.

652
00:29:42,468 --> 00:29:43,780
- What are you doing?

653
00:29:44,915 --> 00:29:45,950
(phone dialing)

654
00:29:45,950 --> 00:29:47,200
- I just can't.

655
00:29:50,283 --> 00:29:51,117
- [Joel] Hello.

656
00:29:51,117 --> 00:29:51,950
- Hi, Joel.

657
00:29:51,950 --> 00:29:52,783
- Okay.

658
00:29:52,783 --> 00:29:53,615
- Yeah, I'm at Daddy's.

659
00:29:53,615 --> 00:29:54,673
Put Ma on, Daddy wants to talk to her.

660
00:29:54,673 --> 00:29:56,440
- You can hang up right now, come on.

661
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:57,503
- No, hey, hey.

662
00:29:58,690 --> 00:29:59,523
Mm-hmm.

663
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:02,730
- It's Ruthie, she says
Pop wants to talk to you.

664
00:30:02,730 --> 00:30:04,763
- Tell him I'm indisposed.

665
00:30:06,690 --> 00:30:08,550
- [Joel] She's indisposed.

666
00:30:08,550 --> 00:30:10,290
- Let me talk to Ma.

667
00:30:10,290 --> 00:30:11,123
- It's Ruthie.

668
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:15,808
- Hi, Ruthie, he needs a secretary

669
00:30:15,808 --> 00:30:17,520
to make his calls for him?

670
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:18,950
- Ask her, where did she hide my sweater,

671
00:30:18,950 --> 00:30:21,400
the brown one with the
leather patches inside.

672
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:23,655
- Tell him the maid quit.

673
00:30:23,655 --> 00:30:26,593
- You know, you're making
a goddamn fool of yourself.

674
00:30:26,593 --> 00:30:29,270
Not that I give a damn, and
there's no food in the icebox.

675
00:30:29,270 --> 00:30:32,470
- It's not an icebox, it's a refrigerator.

676
00:30:32,470 --> 00:30:34,800
And if you wanna complain
about the service,

677
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:36,920
you better get used to
it, because I am finished.

678
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:38,010
You're on your own now.

679
00:30:38,010 --> 00:30:39,260
- That's just fine by me.

680
00:30:39,260 --> 00:30:40,900
- Good, then we agree.

681
00:30:40,900 --> 00:30:41,800
- That'll be the day.

682
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:42,933
- Goodbye, Sam.

683
00:30:45,010 --> 00:30:45,843
- Ma.

684
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:55,123
- Well that's very nice.

685
00:30:55,123 --> 00:30:56,623
You must be proud of yourself.

686
00:30:57,560 --> 00:30:58,503
- She'll be back.

687
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:06,203
- Honey, why aren't you asleep?

688
00:31:07,130 --> 00:31:08,800
- I had a bad dream.

689
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:10,300
- [Molly] Oh, come on up here.

690
00:31:13,140 --> 00:31:15,080
- [Melissa] Can I sleep in your bed?

691
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:17,803
- Okay, for a little
while, go on, get under.

692
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:20,173
- I miss Papa.

693
00:31:21,910 --> 00:31:24,208
- Close your eyes, you'll seen Papa soon.

694
00:31:24,208 --> 00:31:26,393
- Will you take me to see him?

695
00:31:26,393 --> 00:31:28,410
- Your daddy'll take you to see him.

696
00:31:28,410 --> 00:31:30,580
- But I want you to take me.

697
00:31:30,580 --> 00:31:31,998
- I can't, honey.

698
00:31:34,968 --> 00:31:36,483
- Are you mad at Papa?

699
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:40,770
- I don't know.

700
00:31:42,078 --> 00:31:43,963
You know, sometimes people get upset.

701
00:31:44,860 --> 00:31:45,943
Sometimes.

702
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:50,450
(sighing)

703
00:31:50,450 --> 00:31:51,393
Close your eyes.

- Joel.

00:32:17,947 --> 00:32:19,113
Joel, wake up.

712
00:32:20,635 --> 00:32:22,035
You were having a bad dream.

713
00:32:24,545 --> 00:32:26,122
- Oh, I'm all right.

714
00:32:26,122 --> 00:32:27,945
- What were you dreaming?

715
00:32:27,945 --> 00:32:29,740
- Oh, uh.

716
00:32:29,740 --> 00:32:31,500
Oh wow.

717
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:34,090
- Awww, are you okay?

718
00:32:34,090 --> 00:32:34,923
- Mm-hmm.

719
00:32:37,363 --> 00:32:40,280
- Oh, it was that kinda dream, huh?

720
00:32:41,950 --> 00:32:42,783
Come on.

721
00:32:42,783 --> 00:32:45,380
- No, no, my mom's in the next room.

722
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:46,730
- So what, she's been here a week.

723
00:32:46,730 --> 00:32:47,563
She could be here forever.

724
00:32:47,563 --> 00:32:49,503
- No, no, sh sh sh.

725
00:32:52,063 --> 00:32:53,800
Do you hear something?

726
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:55,967
(buzzing)

727
00:32:59,260 --> 00:33:00,820
- Ma?

728
00:33:00,820 --> 00:33:02,330
Ma?

729
00:33:02,330 --> 00:33:05,173
- [Sharon] Molly, what are you doing?

730
00:33:07,460 --> 00:33:10,120
- I couldn't sleep, and
I know how hard it is

731
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:12,040
to keep up with the housework.

732
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:15,093
- I'll do it tomorrow, in the daylight.

733
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,440
- Where is everything?

734
00:33:19,290 --> 00:33:21,450
Where's my Honolulu cooler?

735
00:33:21,450 --> 00:33:23,590
- The plastic pitcher with
the green liquid in it?

736
00:33:23,590 --> 00:33:24,530
I threw it out.

737
00:33:24,530 --> 00:33:25,363
- You threw it out?

738
00:33:25,363 --> 00:33:27,410
- Yeah, but I washed the pitcher.

739
00:33:27,410 --> 00:33:29,340
That stuff's no good for you, Joel.

740
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:30,960
It's nothing but sugar.

741
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:32,110
- It gives you pimples.

742
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:36,400
- Good morning, fish.

743
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:38,708
I hope you slept well,
because I sure didn't.

744
00:33:44,212 --> 00:33:46,878
(water running)

745
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:58,180
I'm going out for a little while.

746
00:33:58,180 --> 00:33:59,173
I'll be home early.

747
00:34:02,900 --> 00:34:06,350
- We all get a little
overheated sometimes.

748
00:34:06,350 --> 00:34:08,880
I could tell you stories
about me and Rose,

749
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:10,797
but what's the difference?

750
00:34:10,797 --> 00:34:12,340
We work it out.

751
00:34:12,340 --> 00:34:14,800
- If Frieda talked to me
the way Molly talked to Sam,

752
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:16,843
her bags'd be out on the
sidewalk in two minutes flat.

753
00:34:16,843 --> 00:34:18,980
- Come on, Feldman,
everybody knows Freida's

754
00:34:18,980 --> 00:34:20,700
got you wrapped around her little finger.

755
00:34:20,700 --> 00:34:22,128
- [Morris] What about you,
Ida coughs and you cringe.

756
00:34:22,128 --> 00:34:24,450
- Bullshit.
- Bullshit yourself.

757
00:34:24,450 --> 00:34:25,283
- Watch it.

758
00:34:26,190 --> 00:34:28,593
Hey, Sam, don't sit
over there by yourself.

759
00:34:28,593 --> 00:34:29,970
Come on, pull up a chair.

760
00:34:29,970 --> 00:34:32,260
- I wouldn't wanna interrupt anything.

761
00:34:32,260 --> 00:34:34,910
- Don't worry about it, we
were just talking about you.

762
00:34:34,910 --> 00:34:37,040
- So, how's the bachelor life?

763
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:38,088
- Compared to what?

764
00:34:38,088 --> 00:34:39,480
- You doing all right, Sam?

765
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:40,620
- Ah, I'm getting along.

766
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:42,510
- Well me and Bernie are
planning a night out.

767
00:34:42,510 --> 00:34:44,650
We're gonna go watch my
son play at a nightclub,

768
00:34:44,650 --> 00:34:45,650
have a few drinks.

769
00:34:45,650 --> 00:34:47,400
- Who knows what else might happen?

770
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:49,010
- Come along, live a little.

771
00:34:49,010 --> 00:34:52,470
- I don't wanna go into that nonsense.

772
00:34:52,470 --> 00:34:53,720
- You listen to these assholes,

773
00:34:53,720 --> 00:34:55,428
you oughta have your head examined.

774
00:34:55,428 --> 00:34:56,415
- What do you know?

775
00:34:56,415 --> 00:34:57,503
- What do I?

776
00:34:57,503 --> 00:35:01,450
I know when a putz stands
up, the brain sits down.

777
00:35:01,450 --> 00:35:03,018
Look, leave him alone, will you?

778
00:35:03,018 --> 00:35:05,450
He's doing a wonderful
job screwing up his life,

779
00:35:05,450 --> 00:35:07,193
without any help from you guys.

780
00:35:09,100 --> 00:35:11,020
- I love this place.

781
00:35:11,020 --> 00:35:12,463
Don't you, it's so intimate.

782
00:35:13,790 --> 00:35:18,310
- Is this your first time, here, I mean?

783
00:35:18,310 --> 00:35:21,478
- No, I've actually been here
a couple of times before.

784
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:25,933
- I'm really happy about my house.

785
00:35:26,783 --> 00:35:27,833
- It's a great house.

786
00:35:29,050 --> 00:35:31,270
I drove the neighborhood
again, not too many kids.

787
00:35:31,270 --> 00:35:32,340
I checked out the comparables,

788
00:35:32,340 --> 00:35:34,670
I think we got a real bargain.

789
00:35:34,670 --> 00:35:37,920
- I don't think I could have
ever done it without your help.

790
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:41,400
Especially since I'm married
to someone who doesn't care

791
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:44,590
where he lives, as long as it's
close to a railroad station.

792
00:35:44,590 --> 00:35:46,180
- Hey, Joel, what are you doing over here

793
00:35:46,180 --> 00:35:47,400
in the corner, hiding?

794
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:50,130
- No, I was actually
having lunch with a client.

795
00:35:50,130 --> 00:35:51,580
We just closed a house deal.

796
00:35:51,580 --> 00:35:52,413
- Oh.

797
00:35:52,413 --> 00:35:53,610
- Matt, this is Tracy Laughlin.

798
00:35:53,610 --> 00:35:55,640
Tracy, this is Matt Muglich.

799
00:35:55,640 --> 00:35:57,420
- [Matt] Tracy, very nice to meet you.

800
00:35:57,420 --> 00:35:58,300
- Hello, Matt.

801
00:35:58,300 --> 00:36:00,120
- [Joel] Now Tracy and her
husband are buying a house.

802
00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:02,470
- Oh, very nice.

803
00:36:02,470 --> 00:36:03,900
Maybe I oughta pull up a chair, huh?

804
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:06,840
- No, no, actually, we were
just getting ready to go.

805
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:09,770
We just have a couple last details to, uh,

806
00:36:09,770 --> 00:36:11,580
to work on the closing.

807
00:36:11,580 --> 00:36:15,760
- Okay, well, Tracy, very
very nice to meet you.

808
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:16,593
- Same here.

809
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:18,980
- Hey, say hi to Sharon for me, huh?

810
00:36:18,980 --> 00:36:19,970
- I will, I'll do that.

811
00:36:19,970 --> 00:36:23,210
- [Matt] And, Melissa, how old
is she now, by the way, five?

812
00:36:23,210 --> 00:36:24,170
- She's almost seven.

813
00:36:24,170 --> 00:36:28,110
- Seven years old, whew,
man, the years fly by, huh?

814
00:36:28,110 --> 00:36:30,140
To think you've been married that long.

815
00:36:30,140 --> 00:36:31,820
Well, I was the best man at your wedding.

816
00:36:31,820 --> 00:36:32,653
I should know, right?

817
00:36:32,653 --> 00:36:34,310
- That's right, you were there, Matt.

818
00:36:34,310 --> 00:36:36,310
- Hey, we're still on for Friday, right?

819
00:36:37,595 --> 00:36:38,428
Whewwww.

820
00:36:40,630 --> 00:36:42,400
- What's Friday?

821
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:46,340
- Uh, we play racquetball
together on Fridays.

822
00:36:46,340 --> 00:36:48,790
- I didn't know you played racquetball.

823
00:36:48,790 --> 00:36:50,310
I play racquetball.

824
00:36:50,310 --> 00:36:51,193
- Oh you do?

825
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:55,240
- I love racquet sports.

826
00:36:55,240 --> 00:36:58,073
(soft jazz music)

827
00:37:02,648 --> 00:37:04,898
- Yoo-hoo, Mr. Kaplan, Sam.

828
00:37:10,673 --> 00:37:12,370
I heard the news.

829
00:37:12,370 --> 00:37:14,150
- It was on CNN?

830
00:37:14,150 --> 00:37:16,180
- I made you some comfort soup.

831
00:37:16,180 --> 00:37:18,470
- Thank you, but I don't
really need anything.

832
00:37:18,470 --> 00:37:21,370
- Everyone needs something
at a time like this.

833
00:37:21,370 --> 00:37:24,113
Jack's been gone for 10
years, I still cook for two.

834
00:37:25,060 --> 00:37:27,750
Come over Friday night,
I'll cook you supper.

835
00:37:27,750 --> 00:37:29,300
- I think I'm busy Friday.

836
00:37:29,300 --> 00:37:30,840
- Too busy to eat supper?

837
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:32,190
Of course you'll come over.

838
00:37:32,190 --> 00:37:33,798
Six o'clock.

839
00:37:33,798 --> 00:37:36,632
(soft jazz music)

840
00:37:43,250 --> 00:37:45,700
- I'm going to driving class,
I'll be back later, Joel.

841
00:37:45,700 --> 00:37:46,892
- Okay.

842
00:37:46,892 --> 00:37:49,300
- Good morning, Molly, you
look scrumptious this morning.

843
00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:50,700
- Oh thank you, Howard.

844
00:37:50,700 --> 00:37:52,460
- A good day for driving lesson, no?

845
00:37:52,460 --> 00:37:53,700
- I hope so.

846
00:37:53,700 --> 00:37:55,690
- Hello, Molly.
- Lou.

847
00:37:55,690 --> 00:37:56,900
- Oh, thank you, Lou.

848
00:37:57,990 --> 00:38:00,203
(soft jazz music)

849
00:38:00,203 --> 00:38:03,035
(engine starting)

850
00:38:07,030 --> 00:38:10,363
(upbeat dramatic music)

851
00:38:33,450 --> 00:38:34,283
- Go ahead, ring.

852
00:38:34,283 --> 00:38:35,470
- Shouldn't we knock?

853
00:38:35,470 --> 00:38:36,990
- What is this, the UN?

854
00:38:36,990 --> 00:38:38,000
- Can you see him?
- No.

855
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,770
- [Ida] Remember, don't antagonize him.

856
00:38:39,770 --> 00:38:41,110
- I don't intend to say a word.

857
00:38:41,110 --> 00:38:42,053
- I gave already.

858
00:38:43,540 --> 00:38:44,760
Why don't you all come in?

859
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:46,530
- You should be ashamed of yourself.

860
00:38:46,530 --> 00:38:49,323
- Frieda, we agreed, I'll do the talking.

861
00:38:50,420 --> 00:38:53,450
We are here to convey to you our--

862
00:38:53,450 --> 00:38:54,690
- Unanimous disapproval.

863
00:38:54,690 --> 00:38:57,850
- Our unanimous disapproval
of your behavior.

864
00:38:57,850 --> 00:39:00,165
- I've never seen such a
thing, like a wild animal.

865
00:39:00,165 --> 00:39:02,120
- Frieda, excuse me, was I talking?

866
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:03,920
- I mean wolves behave better.

867
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:05,510
They stay with their wives.

868
00:39:05,510 --> 00:39:07,770
I saw that on the Discovery Channel.

869
00:39:07,770 --> 00:39:09,130
I shouldn't even call you an animal.

870
00:39:09,130 --> 00:39:11,410
An animal attacks only
when they're threatened.

871
00:39:11,410 --> 00:39:13,200
Who threatened you?

872
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:14,560
- Come on, let's go.

873
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:16,160
- Hold on a minute.

874
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:18,260
- We've come for Molly's things.

875
00:39:18,260 --> 00:39:19,750
- All of them.

876
00:39:19,750 --> 00:39:23,800
- Fine, go ahead, I can
use the closet space.

877
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:25,550
And close the door on your way out.

878
00:39:29,070 --> 00:39:29,930
- We should be careful.

879
00:39:29,930 --> 00:39:31,710
We don't wanna push him over the edge.

880
00:39:31,710 --> 00:39:33,070
- What edge?

881
00:39:33,070 --> 00:39:36,080
- He could go elsewhere,
you know, another woman.

882
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:38,430
- Oh sure, he could go elsewhere.

883
00:39:38,430 --> 00:39:40,683
But elsewhere wouldn't go to him.

884
00:39:41,550 --> 00:39:42,610
- [Frieda] Anything but that.

885
00:39:42,610 --> 00:39:45,060
- Why this is one of Molly's favorites.

886
00:39:45,060 --> 00:39:48,283
- Who was in retail for
27 years, Rose, you or me?

887
00:39:49,980 --> 00:39:51,810
- Going Going Gone Travel.

888
00:39:51,810 --> 00:39:53,650
Mm-hmm, hi.

889
00:39:53,650 --> 00:39:54,483
Yeah.

890
00:39:55,510 --> 00:39:58,180
Yeah, there are indoor
toilets on the island.

891
00:39:58,180 --> 00:39:59,013
Uh-huh.

892
00:40:00,030 --> 00:40:00,863
No no no.

893
00:40:00,863 --> 00:40:04,635
No, civil insurrection is not
covered in the refund clause.

894
00:40:04,635 --> 00:40:05,468
- Come on, I'm double
parked, Ruthie, could--

895
00:40:05,468 --> 00:40:07,240
- Okay, okay.

896
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:09,870
You know what, I'm gonna
call you back in five.

897
00:40:09,870 --> 00:40:10,703
Yes I will.

898
00:40:10,703 --> 00:40:12,803
Yeah, five, I will, all right, bye-bye.

899
00:40:13,670 --> 00:40:14,770
- The Africa trip's on four.

900
00:40:14,770 --> 00:40:16,110
She wants to know about the camels.

901
00:40:16,110 --> 00:40:17,170
- What about the camels?

902
00:40:17,170 --> 00:40:18,260
- She wants the two-hump kind.

903
00:40:18,260 --> 00:40:20,140
She said she'll cancel
if we can't guarantee it.

904
00:40:20,140 --> 00:40:21,260
- You know what?

905
00:40:21,260 --> 00:40:23,020
Can you stall her till
I think of something?

906
00:40:23,020 --> 00:40:24,673
- Sure, I'll take care of it.

907
00:40:29,485 --> 00:40:31,330
- Who's the guy?

908
00:40:31,330 --> 00:40:32,650
- Blake is my new assistant.

909
00:40:32,650 --> 00:40:34,910
And Joel, it's a big booking,

910
00:40:34,910 --> 00:40:36,283
so this better be important, all right?

911
00:40:36,283 --> 00:40:38,270
- She's having an affair.

912
00:40:38,270 --> 00:40:39,103
- Sharon?

913
00:40:39,103 --> 00:40:40,120
- Ma.

914
00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:40,953
- Ma?

915
00:40:40,953 --> 00:40:42,720
- Some aging Don Juan
in her driving class.

916
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:44,390
She's going out on dates with the guy.

917
00:40:44,390 --> 00:40:46,223
- Ma is with some guy?

918
00:40:47,450 --> 00:40:48,540
What does his father do?

919
00:40:48,540 --> 00:40:50,610
- Ha ha ha, it's not funny, Ruthie.

920
00:40:50,610 --> 00:40:52,540
I think she should move in with you.

921
00:40:52,540 --> 00:40:54,780
Your place is small, she
won't feel comfortable there.

922
00:40:54,780 --> 00:40:56,490
It'll force her back to Pop.

923
00:40:56,490 --> 00:40:57,680
- No.

924
00:40:57,680 --> 00:40:59,170
- Why not, you're not living with anybody.

925
00:40:59,170 --> 00:41:00,913
I mean, the scuba diver moved out.

926
00:41:01,820 --> 00:41:04,313
- Oceanographer, and I can't right now.

927
00:41:06,738 --> 00:41:08,170
- Him?

928
00:41:08,170 --> 00:41:09,180
- Shut up.

929
00:41:09,180 --> 00:41:10,530
- God you're selfish.

930
00:41:10,530 --> 00:41:12,080
- I'm selfish, I'm selfish?

931
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:14,280
Joel, that is exactly
the kind of criticism

932
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:16,700
that I do not need in my
life right now, all right?

933
00:41:16,700 --> 00:41:19,100
This is a boundary issue, Joel.

934
00:41:19,100 --> 00:41:21,180
I am, you know what,
I'm just gonna let this

935
00:41:21,180 --> 00:41:23,233
roll of my back like I was a duck, okay.

936
00:41:24,340 --> 00:41:26,553
And besides, I'd be careful if I were you.

937
00:41:26,553 --> 00:41:28,182
I would, all right?

938
00:41:28,182 --> 00:41:29,015
- What's that supposed to mean?

939
00:41:29,015 --> 00:41:30,970
- I'm talking about people
who live in glass houses

940
00:41:30,970 --> 00:41:33,380
and sit at the table by the fireplace

941
00:41:33,380 --> 00:41:35,540
at Adolpho's, all right?

942
00:41:35,540 --> 00:41:38,230
- What, you talked to Matt
Muglich, that scumbag?

943
00:41:38,230 --> 00:41:39,260
- I cannot be--

944
00:41:39,260 --> 00:41:41,570
You're cheating on
Sharon, I could just die.

945
00:41:41,570 --> 00:41:44,020
- It was a client lunch, for Christ sakes.

946
00:41:44,020 --> 00:41:45,310
What, she had some questions, we decided

947
00:41:45,310 --> 00:41:46,350
to go to lunch, that's it.

948
00:41:46,350 --> 00:41:48,677
- Yeah, I don't believe you.

949
00:41:48,677 --> 00:41:50,588
- You know, I don't care.

950
00:41:50,588 --> 00:41:51,660
It's none of your business anyway.

951
00:41:51,660 --> 00:41:53,490
- It is my business.

952
00:41:53,490 --> 00:41:55,407
- It is.
- Don't change the subject.

953
00:41:55,407 --> 00:41:56,240
- I'm not changing the subject.

954
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:57,073
- She's your mother too.

955
00:41:57,073 --> 00:41:58,350
- Joel, I am busy here.

956
00:41:58,350 --> 00:42:00,750
- Look, you wanna leave it all
to me and Sharon, is that it?

957
00:42:00,750 --> 00:42:02,053
You're not gonna help us out at all!

958
00:42:02,053 --> 00:42:04,220
(yelling)

959
00:42:06,700 --> 00:42:08,208
- It's okay, it's okay, Blake.

960
00:42:08,208 --> 00:42:09,040
It's just, it's my brother.

961
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:10,963
He's on his way out.

962
00:42:13,270 --> 00:42:14,353
- I hate you!

963
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:18,780
- It's been two weeks already.

964
00:42:18,780 --> 00:42:22,040
She's had her entire wardrobe shipped in.

965
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:23,750
Where's my lettuce dryer?

966
00:42:23,750 --> 00:42:26,080
I can't find anything.

967
00:42:26,080 --> 00:42:27,393
Did you talk to her?

968
00:42:30,700 --> 00:42:31,533
I knew it.

969
00:42:36,645 --> 00:42:38,520
(door knocking)

970
00:42:38,520 --> 00:42:40,138
- Yeah.

971
00:42:40,138 --> 00:42:41,170
- Do you have a minute, Molly?

972
00:42:41,170 --> 00:42:44,600
- [Molly] For my beautiful
daughter-in-law, always.

973
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:46,933
- Oh wow, that's so nice.

974
00:42:48,690 --> 00:42:52,900
- Not only my daughter-in-law,
but my friend.

975
00:42:52,900 --> 00:42:55,470
- Oh yeah, me too.

976
00:42:55,470 --> 00:42:57,810
That's why I wanted to tell you that

977
00:42:58,750 --> 00:43:01,710
there needs to be more
discussion of your plans.

978
00:43:01,710 --> 00:43:05,440
What your role might be
here if you were to stay.

979
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:07,423
You know, for a long time?

980
00:43:09,070 --> 00:43:11,453
- What do you feel my
role should be, Sharon?

981
00:43:12,410 --> 00:43:15,250
- Okay, this isn't
coming out right at all.

982
00:43:15,250 --> 00:43:17,060
You know we love you.

983
00:43:17,060 --> 00:43:18,530
Melissa loves you.

984
00:43:18,530 --> 00:43:23,303
- She is a great kid, and
you are a wonderful mother.

985
00:43:24,380 --> 00:43:26,160
Yes you are.

986
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:27,520
- Really? Oh wow.

987
00:43:28,500 --> 00:43:30,400
You know, Molly, I'm just
afraid if you stay here

988
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:34,010
much longer we're not
gonna be such good friends.

989
00:43:34,010 --> 00:43:35,840
- Oh, honey.

990
00:43:35,840 --> 00:43:38,570
I can call Ruthie, I
can stay on her couch.

991
00:43:38,570 --> 00:43:40,770
- Oh no, her apartment is too small.

992
00:43:40,770 --> 00:43:42,493
That would drive you crazy.

993
00:43:42,493 --> 00:43:45,480
- Yes, but my being here
is driving you crazy.

994
00:43:45,480 --> 00:43:48,760
- No no no, it's not that I'm crazy, yet.

995
00:43:48,760 --> 00:43:50,113
I just feel that.

996
00:43:52,610 --> 00:43:54,880
Here's the thing, I think
we can work this out.

997
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:55,743
It's just that,

998
00:43:56,690 --> 00:43:58,890
I can't find anything
in my kitchen anymore.

999
00:43:59,878 --> 00:44:02,770
- Oh, that.

1000
00:44:02,770 --> 00:44:06,230
Well, now that is just
a question of system.

1001
00:44:06,230 --> 00:44:08,070
- It's okay, it's okay, I mean,

1002
00:44:08,070 --> 00:44:10,960
it's probably better organized now anyway.

1003
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:15,720
- You know, I always had a
sense of where things belong.

1004
00:44:15,720 --> 00:44:18,533
I'll explain the whole
system to you, it's simple.

1005
00:44:21,670 --> 00:44:23,000
Once you get the hang of it,

1006
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,050
you will never go back to your old system.

1007
00:44:25,050 --> 00:44:27,373
- Oh, no, how could I, of course not.

1008
00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:31,360
- But if you think I should leave?

1009
00:44:31,360 --> 00:44:33,223
Sharon, it's your decision.

1010
00:44:35,290 --> 00:44:36,660
- No.

1011
00:44:36,660 --> 00:44:39,180
No, I think it's gonna be fine, Molly.

1012
00:44:39,180 --> 00:44:41,453
You're welcome to stay, really you are.

1013
00:44:42,628 --> 00:44:43,653
- You sure?
- Yeah.

1014
00:45:06,870 --> 00:45:09,538
(dish sizzling)

1015
00:45:11,645 --> 00:45:14,070
- Sam, I'm so glad you're home.

1016
00:45:14,070 --> 00:45:16,500
I was worried you forgot
about your date tonight.

1017
00:45:16,500 --> 00:45:18,000
- I was just getting ready to go out.

1018
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,598
- What are you afraid of,
I'm not gonna bite you.

1019
00:45:20,598 --> 00:45:21,432
Come on.

1020
00:45:23,640 --> 00:45:24,958
- I'll be a few minutes.

1021
00:45:24,958 --> 00:45:25,792
- Okay.

1022
00:45:27,235 --> 00:45:30,760
(birds chirping)

1023
00:45:30,760 --> 00:45:32,060
- This is the living room.

1024
00:45:33,700 --> 00:45:35,120
- You got a deal on birds?

1025
00:45:35,120 --> 00:45:36,298
- You like them?

1026
00:45:37,358 --> 00:45:38,790
- To me, a bird is a bird.

1027
00:45:38,790 --> 00:45:40,855
I don't bother them, they don't bother me.

1028
00:45:40,855 --> 00:45:42,648
(laughing)

1029
00:45:42,648 --> 00:45:44,120
(oven timer buzzing)

1030
00:45:44,120 --> 00:45:46,978
- Perfect timing, come, come on.

1031
00:45:46,978 --> 00:45:49,728
(birds chirping)

1032
00:45:53,472 --> 00:45:55,600
(sighing)

1033
00:45:55,600 --> 00:45:58,350
(birds chirping)

1034
00:46:00,305 --> 00:46:01,138
- Mm-hmm.

1035
00:46:06,063 --> 00:46:06,980
- Hmm, hmm?

1036
00:46:08,360 --> 00:46:09,200
- It's fine, it's very good.

1037
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:10,573
- Oh.

1038
00:46:10,573 --> 00:46:11,805
- Can you pass me the salt?

1039
00:46:11,805 --> 00:46:15,740
- Ah, I got used to cooking
without salt when Jack got sick.

1040
00:46:15,740 --> 00:46:19,263
You get used to doing without
certain things after a while.

1041
00:46:21,955 --> 00:46:24,203
(chuckling)

1042
00:46:24,203 --> 00:46:26,810
(birds chirping)

1043
00:46:26,810 --> 00:46:27,810
- It's not too late.

1044
00:46:28,970 --> 00:46:30,230
When he shows up, I can get rid of him.

1045
00:46:30,230 --> 00:46:32,240
I'll tell him you moved.

1046
00:46:32,240 --> 00:46:34,040
- Joel, you're really
getting on my nerves.

1047
00:46:34,040 --> 00:46:34,973
Please stop it.

1048
00:46:36,530 --> 00:46:37,530
Do I look all right?

1049
00:46:38,750 --> 00:46:39,930
- You look great.

1050
00:46:41,663 --> 00:46:42,995
(doorbell ringing)

1051
00:46:42,995 --> 00:46:43,995
- He's here!

1052
00:46:45,570 --> 00:46:46,820
- [Molly] Okay.

1053
00:46:51,090 --> 00:46:52,930
- Lou.
- Hello, Molly.

1054
00:46:52,930 --> 00:46:55,870
- Well, don't you look spiffy tonight?

1055
00:46:55,870 --> 00:46:57,420
- I brought you a copy of that book

1056
00:46:57,420 --> 00:46:58,550
that I was telling you about.

1057
00:46:58,550 --> 00:47:01,830
- The Guinness Book of Records, wow.

1058
00:47:01,830 --> 00:47:02,993
Thank you, Lou.

1059
00:47:02,993 --> 00:47:03,980
(throat clearing)

1060
00:47:03,980 --> 00:47:05,600
This is my son, Joel.

1061
00:47:05,600 --> 00:47:07,310
- How do you do, Joel, it's a pleasure.

1062
00:47:07,310 --> 00:47:09,540
You have a beautiful home here.

1063
00:47:09,540 --> 00:47:11,150
- We like it.

1064
00:47:11,150 --> 00:47:12,630
- Look, look what Lou brought me.

1065
00:47:12,630 --> 00:47:14,250
- Oh yeah, that's a great book.

1066
00:47:14,250 --> 00:47:15,550
- This is my daughter-in-law, Sharon.

1067
00:47:15,550 --> 00:47:16,770
- How do you do, Sharon?

1068
00:47:16,770 --> 00:47:18,105
- Hello.

1069
00:47:18,105 --> 00:47:18,980
- And my little jewel, Melissa.

1070
00:47:18,980 --> 00:47:20,910
- Oh, hello little jewel.

1071
00:47:20,910 --> 00:47:22,282
- I'm not a little jewel.

1072
00:47:22,282 --> 00:47:23,890
(chuckling)

1073
00:47:23,890 --> 00:47:25,340
- Kids.

1074
00:47:25,340 --> 00:47:27,000
- Where are you taking
my mother this evening?

1075
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:29,350
I want you to know that I don't
approve of the whole thing.

1076
00:47:29,350 --> 00:47:31,520
I can understand how you feel.

1077
00:47:31,520 --> 00:47:33,300
But you don't have to worry about a thing.

1078
00:47:33,300 --> 00:47:34,830
Your mother is in good hands.

1079
00:47:34,830 --> 00:47:37,040
I've had my driver's
license for over a week.

1080
00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:38,930
And besides, what with these new cars,

1081
00:47:38,930 --> 00:47:41,300
they practically drive themselves.

1082
00:47:41,300 --> 00:47:43,988
They have digital maps,
compasses, they talk to you.

1083
00:47:43,988 --> 00:47:45,393
- I think we should go now, Lou.

1084
00:47:45,393 --> 00:47:47,143
- They give you directions,
and if you don't

1085
00:47:47,143 --> 00:47:48,883
know where to go they
give you an itinerary.

1086
00:47:48,883 --> 00:47:49,715
- I really think should run.

1087
00:47:49,715 --> 00:47:50,548
Come on, Lou, bye.

1088
00:47:50,548 --> 00:47:52,100
- Bye, Nana.
- Bye, sweetheart.

1089
00:47:52,100 --> 00:47:53,560
- [Sharon] Nice to meet you.

1090
00:47:53,560 --> 00:47:55,060
- [Lou] Goodnight.

1091
00:47:58,890 --> 00:48:00,400
- Nice to meet you?

1092
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:01,580
I can't believe you just said that.

1093
00:48:01,580 --> 00:48:03,180
- Oh, listen to this, Joel.

1094
00:48:03,180 --> 00:48:05,570
A mother-in-law in the Ural Mountains

1095
00:48:05,570 --> 00:48:09,310
logged an 87-year visit
to the home of her son,

1096
00:48:09,310 --> 00:48:13,050
cut short only by the avalanche of 1871,

1097
00:48:13,050 --> 00:48:16,100
which destroyed their entire village.

1098
00:48:16,100 --> 00:48:18,023
- [Lou] Well, what do you think?

1099
00:48:18,023 --> 00:48:20,313
- Ooh, it's so, so new.

1100
00:48:23,240 --> 00:48:24,873
Oh no, I couldn't.

1101
00:48:24,873 --> 00:48:25,823
- Come on, come on.

1102
00:48:27,220 --> 00:48:28,053
- I shouldn't.

1103
00:48:29,840 --> 00:48:31,263
Oh boy.

1104
00:48:32,330 --> 00:48:33,163
Woo.

1105
00:48:34,825 --> 00:48:37,575
(engine revving)

1106
00:48:44,728 --> 00:48:47,562
(tires squealing)

1107
00:48:49,020 --> 00:48:52,020
- Well, you cooked a
good dinner, thank you.

1108
00:48:52,020 --> 00:48:53,380
I told some friends I would meet them,

1109
00:48:53,380 --> 00:48:55,350
so I'm a little late.

1110
00:48:55,350 --> 00:48:57,670
- Look, look.

1111
00:48:57,670 --> 00:48:59,950
It's natural that you're down in the dumps

1112
00:48:59,950 --> 00:49:01,233
at a time like this.

1113
00:49:02,820 --> 00:49:05,590
I thought a little conversation

1114
00:49:05,590 --> 00:49:08,770
might get your mind off
things, huh (chuckles)?

1115
00:49:08,770 --> 00:49:11,430
- Listen, Mrs. Rosen, Silvia,

1116
00:49:11,430 --> 00:49:13,328
I appreciate what you're trying to do,

1117
00:49:13,328 --> 00:49:15,070
but there's a situation here that

1118
00:49:15,070 --> 00:49:17,123
conversation isn't going to solve.

1119
00:49:18,810 --> 00:49:22,340
The fact of the matter is,
my wife drives me crazy.

1120
00:49:22,340 --> 00:49:23,710
And if you asked her, she would tell you

1121
00:49:23,710 --> 00:49:24,910
the same thing about me.

1122
00:49:26,070 --> 00:49:28,200
- So what else is new, that's marriage.

1123
00:49:28,200 --> 00:49:30,650
- If that's marriage, who needs it?

1124
00:49:30,650 --> 00:49:32,350
- You got a better system?

1125
00:49:32,350 --> 00:49:35,960
So what are you gonna do, you
gonna fight with strangers?

1126
00:49:35,960 --> 00:49:39,795
You think that, that
every time Jack brought in

1127
00:49:39,795 --> 00:49:43,020
one of his (foreign
language) $500 canaries,

1128
00:49:43,020 --> 00:49:44,560
that I didn't wanna throw him

1129
00:49:44,560 --> 00:49:46,403
and the bird out into the street?

1130
00:49:47,500 --> 00:49:49,250
One time, I was so upset with him,

1131
00:49:49,250 --> 00:49:51,800
I took a bus down to his office.

1132
00:49:51,800 --> 00:49:54,590
I let out all the air on his tires.

1133
00:49:54,590 --> 00:49:56,378
He never found out who did it.

1134
00:49:56,378 --> 00:49:57,212
(laughing)

1135
00:49:57,212 --> 00:49:58,045
It was war.

1136
00:49:58,045 --> 00:49:59,713
- That's exactly what it is, it's war.

1137
00:50:00,770 --> 00:50:01,603
- Oh, but.

1138
00:50:02,660 --> 00:50:06,670
Sometimes, even in a war,
you have to call a truce.

1139
00:50:06,670 --> 00:50:07,813
Sometimes you have to,

1140
00:50:08,790 --> 00:50:10,253
you have to give in a little.

1141
00:50:13,450 --> 00:50:15,613
Go on over there and make up.

1142
00:50:16,870 --> 00:50:17,703
Believe me,

1143
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:21,990
fighting with somebody
is better than not having

1144
00:50:21,990 --> 00:50:23,523
anybody to fight with at all.

1145
00:50:25,330 --> 00:50:27,630
- I just want to say congratulations.

1146
00:50:27,630 --> 00:50:31,043
I am proud of all of you for
passing your driver's tests.

1147
00:50:31,043 --> 00:50:32,278
(applause)

1148
00:50:32,278 --> 00:50:34,895
Yes, very good.

1149
00:50:34,895 --> 00:50:37,300
And I know you think you have
answered all the questions

1150
00:50:37,300 --> 00:50:39,363
correctly, but I have one more question.

1151
00:50:40,650 --> 00:50:43,090
What's the one time an alert driver

1152
00:50:43,090 --> 00:50:44,740
is not in control of the vehicle?

1153
00:50:45,700 --> 00:50:46,533
Anybody.

1154
00:50:46,533 --> 00:50:48,650
(murmuring)

1155
00:50:48,650 --> 00:50:50,000
When he sneezes.

1156
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:52,940
- The sneeze, of course, the
heart stops, the eyes close.

1157
00:50:52,940 --> 00:50:54,220
You can't drive like that, I should have.

1158
00:50:54,220 --> 00:50:56,070
- Of course not, here we are.

1159
00:50:56,070 --> 00:50:58,970
- Oh, no thank you, I think
I'm the designated driver.

1160
00:50:58,970 --> 00:51:01,160
- Don't worry, it's nonalcoholic.

1161
00:51:01,160 --> 00:51:03,700
- Okay, thank you.

1162
00:51:03,700 --> 00:51:06,160
- The rate at which one gets inebriated

1163
00:51:06,160 --> 00:51:08,500
depends on many factors.

1164
00:51:08,500 --> 00:51:11,900
General physical condition,
level of fatigue,

1165
00:51:11,900 --> 00:51:13,590
and body weight.

1166
00:51:13,590 --> 00:51:15,983
Molly, what do you weigh?

1167
00:51:17,950 --> 00:51:20,440
It's in the interest of science.

1168
00:51:20,440 --> 00:51:24,428
- I, I'm, really I'm not
that interested in science.

1169
00:51:24,428 --> 00:51:25,293
- Oh.

(applause)

1188
00:52:38,195 --> 00:52:39,820
- I could hear every word.

1189
00:52:39,820 --> 00:52:42,350
- Even as a kid, Allen was artistic.

1190
00:52:42,350 --> 00:52:44,150
- [Bernie] He's following his dream.

1191
00:52:45,620 --> 00:52:46,453
- Dad.

1192
00:52:46,453 --> 00:52:47,910
- That was a great song, Allen.

1193
00:52:47,910 --> 00:52:50,400
- Thanks, glad you liked it.

1194
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:52,040
- Aren't you going to
introduce us to your friend?

1195
00:52:52,040 --> 00:52:53,240
- Oh, sorry, yeah.

1196
00:52:53,240 --> 00:52:55,230
This is Sheila.

1197
00:52:55,230 --> 00:52:56,267
- [Morris] Sheila who?

1198
00:52:56,267 --> 00:52:57,450
- Tagliaferro.

1199
00:52:57,450 --> 00:52:58,700
- [Morris] I'm Allen's dad.

1200
00:52:58,700 --> 00:52:59,533
- Hi, Dad.

1201
00:52:59,533 --> 00:53:00,370
- Sit down, take a load off.

1202
00:53:00,370 --> 00:53:01,580
- Here, take my seat.

1203
00:53:01,580 --> 00:53:02,720
I'm gonna get myself a beer.

1204
00:53:02,720 --> 00:53:03,700
I'll be back in a minute.

1205
00:53:03,700 --> 00:53:05,290
- [Allen] Thanks.

1206
00:53:05,290 --> 00:53:07,550
- So, Sheila, have you known Allen long?

1207
00:53:07,550 --> 00:53:08,800
- Not so long.

1208
00:53:08,800 --> 00:53:10,383
We just met tonight actually.

1209
00:53:12,455 --> 00:53:13,480
- Ah.

1210
00:53:13,480 --> 00:53:15,570
- Of course, there are many other things

1211
00:53:15,570 --> 00:53:17,430
that can cause accidents.

1212
00:53:17,430 --> 00:53:21,220
Velocity, mechanical condition
of the braking system,

1213
00:53:21,220 --> 00:53:23,740
road conditions, so forth and so forth.

1214
00:53:23,740 --> 00:53:26,800
And of course, personal response time.

1215
00:53:26,800 --> 00:53:29,160
- Personal response time, very important.

1216
00:53:29,160 --> 00:53:32,200
- Now, personal response time itself

1217
00:53:32,200 --> 00:53:34,190
can be affected by several factors.

1218
00:53:34,190 --> 00:53:37,110
- Particularly if you happen
to be sneezing at the time.

1219
00:53:37,110 --> 00:53:39,723
- No, that's an entirely separate issue.

1220
00:53:42,080 --> 00:53:43,057
Now.

1221
00:53:43,057 --> 00:53:46,148
(soft music)

1222
00:53:46,148 --> 00:53:46,982
♪ I don't want it ♪

1223
00:53:46,982 --> 00:53:48,515
- Hi.

1224
00:53:48,515 --> 00:53:49,483
- Hi yourself.

1225
00:53:49,483 --> 00:53:51,640
♪ I don't want it ♪

1226
00:53:51,640 --> 00:53:53,033
- I love that song.

1227
00:53:54,730 --> 00:53:56,200
What, you don't like it?

1228
00:53:56,200 --> 00:53:57,393
No, no, I like it.

1229
00:53:58,890 --> 00:54:00,480
Don't want what, exactly?

1230
00:54:00,480 --> 00:54:01,580
- Oh you know.

1231
00:54:01,580 --> 00:54:03,060
Anything you don't want.

1232
00:54:03,060 --> 00:54:03,893
- Mm-hmm.

1233
00:54:05,990 --> 00:54:07,920
I hadn't thought of it that way.

1234
00:54:07,920 --> 00:54:09,570
- Because I bet there's
something in your life

1235
00:54:09,570 --> 00:54:10,630
that you don't want, right?

1236
00:54:10,630 --> 00:54:11,713
- Oh believe me.

1237
00:54:13,400 --> 00:54:14,880
- My name is Heather.

1238
00:54:14,880 --> 00:54:16,370
- Sam, Sam Kaplan.

1239
00:54:16,370 --> 00:54:18,533
- Hi, Sam.
- Hi, Heather.

1240
00:54:18,533 --> 00:54:21,282
(laughing)

1241
00:54:21,282 --> 00:54:22,115
- Would you like a drink?

1242
00:54:22,115 --> 00:54:24,663
- Sure, that'd be great, I'll have a beer.

1243
00:54:24,663 --> 00:54:26,803
- Can we have another beer here, please?

1244
00:54:26,803 --> 00:54:28,853
- I like you, you're cute, you know that?

1245
00:54:30,230 --> 00:54:32,270
- At my age, all I get left is my looks.

1246
00:54:32,270 --> 00:54:34,520
(laughing)

1247
00:54:36,522 --> 00:54:37,438
Yeah, yeah.

1248
00:54:39,358 --> 00:54:40,630
You come here often?

1249
00:54:40,630 --> 00:54:42,410
- Every chance I get.

1250
00:54:42,410 --> 00:54:45,773
I get really tense at work,
and the music relaxes me.

1251
00:54:46,750 --> 00:54:48,190
- I get tense myself sometimes.

1252
00:54:48,190 --> 00:54:49,780
- Oh yeah, what do you do, Sam?

1253
00:54:49,780 --> 00:54:52,100
- I'm retired, I used to be
in the clothing business,

1254
00:54:52,100 --> 00:54:53,860
but I sold out.

1255
00:54:53,860 --> 00:54:56,247
- Oh, I bet you made a bundle.

1256
00:54:56,247 --> 00:54:59,830
- Oh, well, I wouldn't say that exactly.

1257
00:55:00,810 --> 00:55:02,510
- You know, I was married once.

1258
00:55:02,510 --> 00:55:03,610
Didn't work out, though.

1259
00:55:03,610 --> 00:55:05,013
- I'm sorry to hear that.

1260
00:55:05,013 --> 00:55:05,963
- It's okay.

1261
00:55:07,050 --> 00:55:10,090
It only lasted a couple of
months, no permanent damage.

1262
00:55:10,090 --> 00:55:10,923
- Oh.

1263
00:55:10,923 --> 00:55:12,720
- I bet you been married
a long time, though, huh?

1264
00:55:12,720 --> 00:55:14,448
- Well, 40 years.

1265
00:55:14,448 --> 00:55:16,438
- 40 years, you're kidding.

1266
00:55:16,438 --> 00:55:17,270
- 40 years, no, I'm not.

1267
00:55:17,270 --> 00:55:19,940
- That's fantastic, you look so young.

1268
00:55:19,940 --> 00:55:21,033
- Really?
- Yeah.

1269
00:55:22,030 --> 00:55:22,863
- Hey, babe.

1270
00:55:22,863 --> 00:55:23,740
- Hi, Sean.

1271
00:55:23,740 --> 00:55:24,573
Where you been?

1272
00:55:24,573 --> 00:55:25,630
- Working late.

1273
00:55:25,630 --> 00:55:27,260
We're going over to Sally's, let's go.

1274
00:55:27,260 --> 00:55:28,160
- Cool.

1275
00:55:28,160 --> 00:55:30,973
Oh, it was real nice talking to you, Sam.

1276
00:55:33,730 --> 00:55:35,300
Thanks for the beer.

1277
00:55:35,300 --> 00:55:36,133
- Yep.

1278
00:55:39,158 --> 00:55:39,990
Hmm.

1279
00:55:39,990 --> 00:55:42,393
(chattering)

1280
00:55:42,393 --> 00:55:45,227
(soft jazz music)

1281
00:56:16,068 --> 00:56:18,890
(window squeaking)

1282
00:56:18,890 --> 00:56:21,730
(soft jazz music)

1283
00:56:21,730 --> 00:56:22,643
- [Joel] That's them.

1284
00:56:25,270 --> 00:56:26,103
- Joel!

1285
00:56:27,060 --> 00:56:29,433
- Thank you, Lou, I had a lovely time.

1286
00:56:30,450 --> 00:56:31,500
It was very

1287
00:56:33,140 --> 00:56:33,973
informative.

1288
00:56:33,973 --> 00:56:35,560
- Oh, I'm glad.

1289
00:56:35,560 --> 00:56:37,745
What a lovely evening.

1290
00:56:37,745 --> 00:56:40,578
(soft jazz music)

1291
00:56:43,970 --> 00:56:46,460
Let's do it again sometime.

1292
00:56:46,460 --> 00:56:48,180
- Excuse me, excuse me.

1293
00:56:48,180 --> 00:56:50,088
Do you two have any idea what time it is?

1294
00:56:50,088 --> 00:56:51,850
I have been worried sick.

1295
00:56:51,850 --> 00:56:54,520
- Joel, what are you doing up?

1296
00:56:54,520 --> 00:56:56,152
- Worrying?

1297
00:56:56,152 --> 00:56:58,818
(siren blaring)

1298
00:57:01,367 --> 00:57:02,520
(radio chattering)

1299
00:57:02,520 --> 00:57:04,030
- [Molly] What's going on over there?

1300
00:57:04,030 --> 00:57:05,570
- I don't know, Ma, the
cops'll take care of it.

1301
00:57:05,570 --> 00:57:07,678
Come on, we're going to bed.

1302
00:57:07,678 --> 00:57:09,370
- Do you live around here, sir?

1303
00:57:09,370 --> 00:57:12,240
- You got it all there
on the driver's license.

1304
00:57:12,240 --> 00:57:14,090
- Would you step away from the car, sir?

1305
00:57:14,090 --> 00:57:17,580
- Looks like somebody's
being arrested, I can't tell.

1306
00:57:17,580 --> 00:57:18,663
Lou, can you see?

1307
00:57:19,680 --> 00:57:21,980
- Just step away from the car, sir.

1308
00:57:21,980 --> 00:57:24,360
- Uniform and a pistol and you
guys think you own the world.

1309
00:57:24,360 --> 00:57:25,810
- Would you walk a little for me, sir?

1310
00:57:25,810 --> 00:57:26,760
- Hey don't push, don't push.

1311
00:57:26,760 --> 00:57:29,800
- [Officer] Registered to a
Sam Kaplan on Oakmont Avenue.

1312
00:57:29,800 --> 00:57:31,170
- That's at least 10 miles from here.

1313
00:57:31,170 --> 00:57:32,070
- [Sam] So what if it is?

1314
00:57:32,070 --> 00:57:34,740
- [Sharon] Joel, what's
going on down there?

1315
00:57:34,740 --> 00:57:36,400
- I'll be up in a minute.

1316
00:57:36,400 --> 00:57:37,790
Ma, please.

1317
00:57:37,790 --> 00:57:40,970
- Less than 10% of all arrests

1318
00:57:40,970 --> 00:57:43,273
in the United States end in conviction.

1319
00:57:44,545 --> 00:57:45,378
- That few?

1320
00:57:45,378 --> 00:57:47,610
- It's in the World Almanac,
I'll lend you my copy.

1321
00:57:47,610 --> 00:57:49,840
- This guy's license
expired six months ago.

1322
00:57:49,840 --> 00:57:52,150
- Sir, are you aware you're
driving with an expired license?

1323
00:57:52,150 --> 00:57:53,390
- What are you, the Gestapo?

1324
00:57:53,390 --> 00:57:55,678
You guys lost the war,
don't you remember, come on.

1325
00:57:55,678 --> 00:57:57,400
- All right, that does it, buddy.

1326
00:57:57,400 --> 00:57:58,333
Spread 'em.

1327
00:57:58,333 --> 00:57:59,780
You have the right to remain silent.

1328
00:57:59,780 --> 00:58:02,050
- I had no idea you had problems like this

1329
00:58:02,050 --> 00:58:04,310
in your neighborhood, Joel.

1330
00:58:04,310 --> 00:58:07,955
- I think maybe it's time for
you to go home, Mr. Moskowitz.

1331
00:58:07,955 --> 00:58:08,788
- Oh.

1332
00:58:10,120 --> 00:58:11,840
I've enjoyed the evening, Molly.

1333
00:58:11,840 --> 00:58:14,220
- Me too, Lou, thanks again, goodnight.

1334
00:58:14,220 --> 00:58:15,500
- Goodnight.

1335
00:58:15,500 --> 00:58:19,600
- You, you, homewrecker,
wait'll I get my hands on you!

1336
00:58:19,600 --> 00:58:21,000
- Sam?

1337
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:24,665
- In my son's house, in
front of my grandchild!

1338
00:58:24,665 --> 00:58:25,498
Ow!

1339
00:58:26,423 --> 00:58:31,423
- Pop?

1340
00:58:33,368 --> 00:58:36,035
(phone ringing)

1341
00:58:38,288 --> 00:58:40,130
- You okay, Pop?

1342
00:58:40,130 --> 00:58:41,963
- [Officer] Sign here.

1343
00:58:42,970 --> 00:58:44,180
- My back is turned for five minutes,

1344
00:58:44,180 --> 00:58:46,840
and you're running around
till all hours of the night?

1345
00:58:46,840 --> 00:58:48,390
Having me arrested?

1346
00:58:48,390 --> 00:58:50,190
- I didn't have you
arrested, are you crazy?

1347
00:58:50,190 --> 00:58:51,750
- I may be crazy, but I'm not stupid.

1348
00:58:51,750 --> 00:58:53,800
I saw you, the both of you.

1349
00:58:53,800 --> 00:58:54,930
And in your house.

1350
00:58:54,930 --> 00:58:55,798
- You were spying on me?

1351
00:58:55,798 --> 00:58:57,350
- Are you all right, Daddy?

1352
00:58:57,350 --> 00:58:59,400
- Of course I'm all right,
why wouldn't I be all right?

1353
00:58:59,400 --> 00:59:01,500
My back is turned for five
minutes, and my wife is running

1354
00:59:01,500 --> 00:59:03,530
around till all hours of
the night with another man!

1355
00:59:03,530 --> 00:59:04,390
- Pop, with the voice.

1356
00:59:04,390 --> 00:59:05,900
- Don't with the voice me.

1357
00:59:05,900 --> 00:59:07,880
- All of a sudden you're
so interested in what I do?

1358
00:59:07,880 --> 00:59:09,430
All of a sudden you give a damn?

1359
00:59:09,430 --> 00:59:11,978
- I forbid you to go out with another man.

1360
00:59:11,978 --> 00:59:13,110
- Forbid me?

1361
00:59:13,110 --> 00:59:16,850
I've got news for you, you
don't forbid me anything.

1362
00:59:16,850 --> 00:59:17,683
- Tell him, girlfriend.

1363
00:59:17,683 --> 00:59:19,600
- Hey, don't let her talk to you that way.

1364
00:59:19,600 --> 00:59:21,290
- Daddy, I'm gonna call Eldon Krantz.

1365
00:59:21,290 --> 00:59:23,140
- Who, that fisher witch doctor?

1366
00:59:23,140 --> 00:59:24,700
The one you went out with for a whole year

1367
00:59:24,700 --> 00:59:26,975
and he dropped you like a hot potato?

1368
00:59:26,975 --> 00:59:28,660
- Don't you talk to Ruthie like that.

1369
00:59:28,660 --> 00:59:30,930
- I'll talk to Ruthie any way I want.

1370
00:59:30,930 --> 00:59:32,068
I wasn't talking to you anyway.

1371
00:59:32,068 --> 00:59:34,950
- Can you take your family
problems out on the street?

1372
00:59:34,950 --> 00:59:36,930
- Another stormtrooper heard from.

1373
00:59:36,930 --> 00:59:37,763
- Pop!

1374
00:59:37,763 --> 00:59:39,190
- This is what I have to put up with.

1375
00:59:39,190 --> 00:59:42,200
You open your month, and snakes come out.

1376
00:59:42,200 --> 00:59:44,510
- You wanna talk to me, talk to my lawyer.

1377
00:59:44,510 --> 00:59:46,050
- You don't have a lawyer.

1378
00:59:46,050 --> 00:59:46,920
- I'll get one.

1379
00:59:46,920 --> 00:59:49,910
- Don't let them get
you no public defender,

1380
00:59:49,910 --> 00:59:51,780
because those guys, they don't know shit.

1381
00:59:51,780 --> 00:59:53,800
- And in my own son's house.

1382
00:59:53,800 --> 00:59:55,320
- Oh come off it, Pop, where did you

1383
00:59:55,320 --> 00:59:56,873
want her to stay, at the Y?

1384
00:59:56,873 --> 00:59:59,700
- [Officer] Will you please get
your father out of here now?

1385
00:59:59,700 --> 01:00:00,533
- Let's go, Pop.

1386
01:00:00,533 --> 01:00:02,397
- Daddy, you need to have
somebody look at your head.

1387
01:00:02,397 --> 01:00:04,958
- [Sam] My head is fine,
don't worry about it!

1388
01:00:04,958 --> 01:00:07,290
You're the ones who are crazy!

1389
01:00:07,290 --> 01:00:09,340
(birds chirping)

1390
01:00:09,340 --> 01:00:12,010
- [Joel] Ma, you didn't
even give him a chance.

1391
01:00:12,010 --> 01:00:13,890
- I'm supposed to make
pleasant conversation?

1392
01:00:13,890 --> 01:00:16,330
Come on, he's worse than ever.

1393
01:00:16,330 --> 01:00:18,710
- Why'd you let him walk
away like that, though, Mom?

1394
01:00:18,710 --> 01:00:19,593
Poor Daddy.

1395
01:00:20,590 --> 01:00:21,623
- Poor Daddy.

1396
01:00:22,720 --> 01:00:24,330
He's the saint and I'm the villain.

1397
01:00:24,330 --> 01:00:26,660
Because he's miserable, I
have to be miserable too.

1398
01:00:26,660 --> 01:00:27,493
No thank you.

1399
01:00:27,493 --> 01:00:29,970
If he wants a dog to
kick, let him get one.

1400
01:00:29,970 --> 01:00:31,300
- You know what he said to me when

1401
01:00:31,300 --> 01:00:33,260
I told him I was getting married?

1402
01:00:33,260 --> 01:00:34,370
You should only find the same happiness

1403
01:00:34,370 --> 01:00:36,420
I've had with your mother.

1404
01:00:36,420 --> 01:00:37,940
- He said that?

1405
01:00:37,940 --> 01:00:40,243
- Well, maybe he mumbled it.

1406
01:00:46,410 --> 01:00:47,710
- What happened to your head?

1407
01:00:47,710 --> 01:00:49,470
- Nothing, I bumped it rushing over here

1408
01:00:49,470 --> 01:00:51,513
so I wouldn't miss the early-bird special.

1409
01:00:51,513 --> 01:00:52,347
- Ohhhh.

1410
01:00:52,347 --> 01:00:53,373
- What's this?
- What's what?

1411
01:00:54,380 --> 01:00:56,230
- I see a piece of cellophane.

1412
01:00:56,230 --> 01:00:57,063
- Cellophane?

1413
01:00:58,677 --> 01:00:59,510
That's not cellophane,

1414
01:00:59,510 --> 01:01:01,848
that's the natural casing in the salami.

1415
01:01:01,848 --> 01:01:02,680
Cellophane?

1416
01:01:02,680 --> 01:01:03,640
- Hey, hey, Stub.

1417
01:01:03,640 --> 01:01:05,400
- Milo, what'll you have?

1418
01:01:05,400 --> 01:01:07,190
- Try the cellophane special.

1419
01:01:07,190 --> 01:01:09,690
- I'd like to, but I gotta
lotta work to do today.

1420
01:01:10,810 --> 01:01:11,720
- Have some coffee.

1421
01:01:11,720 --> 01:01:13,600
- [Milo] Yeah, I heard about your escapade

1422
01:01:13,600 --> 01:01:14,730
with the boys in blue.

1423
01:01:14,730 --> 01:01:15,563
- What about it?

1424
01:01:16,528 --> 01:01:19,270
- Well, I gotta tell you
Sam, you look like hell.

1425
01:01:19,270 --> 01:01:20,980
- You know what Ruthie
had the nerve to tell me?

1426
01:01:20,980 --> 01:01:22,720
I should see a therapist.

1427
01:01:22,720 --> 01:01:24,560
Another county heard from.

1428
01:01:24,560 --> 01:01:27,020
- [Milo] You need to
talk to somebody, Sam.

1429
01:01:27,020 --> 01:01:29,000
- You go, you tell me all about it.

1430
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:30,830
- Why don't you talk to your rabbi?

1431
01:01:30,830 --> 01:01:32,680
- I sold my golf clubs.

1432
01:01:32,680 --> 01:01:33,990
- Then talk to Father Malachy.

1433
01:01:33,990 --> 01:01:35,653
He's known you both for a long time.

1434
01:01:35,653 --> 01:01:37,500
- Over my dead body.

1435
01:01:37,500 --> 01:01:39,160
I don't have to talk to anybody, period.

1436
01:01:39,160 --> 01:01:41,253
- Good, fine, you wanna bullshit yourself?

1437
01:01:41,253 --> 01:01:44,050
You go right ahead, just
don't try to bullshit me.

1438
01:01:44,050 --> 01:01:45,190
You got yourself in a mess,

1439
01:01:45,190 --> 01:01:46,218
and you don't know how to get out of it.

1440
01:01:46,218 --> 01:01:47,550
- Are you finished?

1441
01:01:47,550 --> 01:01:48,910
- No I'm not finished.

1442
01:01:48,910 --> 01:01:51,110
You got your health, you
got food on the table,

1443
01:01:51,110 --> 01:01:52,950
you can take a holiday now and then.

1444
01:01:52,950 --> 01:01:54,200
And whether you wanna believe it or not,

1445
01:01:54,200 --> 01:01:57,200
you got a great wife
and a wonderful family.

1446
01:01:57,200 --> 01:01:58,925
So what is your problem?

1447
01:01:58,925 --> 01:02:01,680
People don't jump anymore
when you open your mouth?

1448
01:02:01,680 --> 01:02:03,892
Your memory starts to fade now and then?

1449
01:02:03,892 --> 01:02:06,730
Your joints ache a little when
you get up in the morning?

1450
01:02:06,730 --> 01:02:08,410
Join the club.

1451
01:02:08,410 --> 01:02:10,620
You wanna take something
God-given and precious

1452
01:02:10,620 --> 01:02:13,470
and flush it down the toilet, be my guest.

1453
01:02:13,470 --> 01:02:14,683
Just leave me out of it.

1454
01:02:17,690 --> 01:02:18,913
Now I'm finished.

1455
01:02:20,940 --> 01:02:22,540
- Who asked your opinion anyway?

1456
01:02:23,440 --> 01:02:25,913
I don't have to take
this crap from anybody!

1457
01:02:28,738 --> 01:02:31,488
(engine failing)

1458
01:02:36,188 --> 01:02:37,022
- Damn.

1459
01:02:37,022 --> 01:02:38,680
- Pop.

1460
01:02:38,680 --> 01:02:39,513
- Oh, hi.

1461
01:02:40,655 --> 01:02:42,160
- What are you doing?

1462
01:02:42,160 --> 01:02:43,160
- I hate this thing.

1463
01:02:45,140 --> 01:02:46,690
- It's probably the spark plug.

1464
01:02:49,680 --> 01:02:51,180
- You know how to do all this?

1465
01:02:52,840 --> 01:02:55,650
- These things get
fouled up after a while.

1466
01:02:55,650 --> 01:02:56,850
- [Sam] Everything does.

1467
01:03:00,317 --> 01:03:01,918
- When's the last time you gave

1468
01:03:01,918 --> 01:03:03,220
this lawnmower some attention?

1469
01:03:03,220 --> 01:03:04,723
- I don't remember.

1470
01:03:08,230 --> 01:03:10,310
- You're not even gonna
ask me about Mom, are you?

1471
01:03:10,310 --> 01:03:11,310
- I am not.

1472
01:03:11,310 --> 01:03:14,693
(birds chirping)

1473
01:03:14,693 --> 01:03:15,580
- Don't you care?

1474
01:03:15,580 --> 01:03:17,690
- You wouldn't understand.

1475
01:03:17,690 --> 01:03:19,370
You're implicated in this, Joel.

1476
01:03:19,370 --> 01:03:21,360
If not for you, she would still be here.

1477
01:03:21,360 --> 01:03:22,740
You drove the getaway car.

1478
01:03:22,740 --> 01:03:25,980
- That is the most pathetic
thing I've ever heard.

1479
01:03:25,980 --> 01:03:28,210
- You shoulda brought her right back.

1480
01:03:28,210 --> 01:03:30,440
- Do you know why I came here today?

1481
01:03:30,440 --> 01:03:31,990
- The lawnmower repair company sent you?

1482
01:03:31,990 --> 01:03:34,623
- I came here to see you,
to see how you're doing.

1483
01:03:35,760 --> 01:03:37,260
- Look around, I'm doing fine.

1484
01:03:39,040 --> 01:03:41,477
I've had a couple of rough days.

1485
01:03:41,477 --> 01:03:42,783
Food coulda been better.

1486
01:03:44,290 --> 01:03:46,703
So, how's your mother?

1487
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:50,660
- As stubborn as you.

1488
01:03:50,660 --> 01:03:54,545
(lawnmower starting)

1489
01:03:54,545 --> 01:03:56,122
- I'm impressed.

1490
01:03:56,122 --> 01:03:56,955
- What?

1491
01:03:57,807 --> 01:03:59,057
- Good for you.

1492
01:03:59,057 --> 01:03:59,890
- Huh?

1493
01:04:01,818 --> 01:04:02,818
- Forget it.

1494
01:04:15,375 --> 01:04:16,543
- You're good.

1495
01:04:18,445 --> 01:04:19,528
- Great game.

1496
01:04:20,630 --> 01:04:21,593
You're good.

1497
01:04:21,593 --> 01:04:24,927
- Yeah, not good enough, you're amazing.

1498
01:04:27,100 --> 01:04:29,580
(door knocking)

1499
01:04:29,580 --> 01:04:31,093
- Hey, Joel, Tracy.

1500
01:04:31,940 --> 01:04:33,153
How about a little doubles?

1501
01:04:34,030 --> 01:04:35,528
- No, I gotta get home.

1502
01:04:35,528 --> 01:04:36,662
- Why, what time is it?

1503
01:04:36,662 --> 01:04:37,648
- Five after seven.

1504
01:04:37,648 --> 01:04:40,250
- Oh, shit, I told Peter I'd pick him up

1505
01:04:40,250 --> 01:04:43,180
at the railroad station at 7:30.

1506
01:04:43,180 --> 01:04:44,013
I had fun.

1507
01:04:46,040 --> 01:04:47,510
Call me.

1508
01:04:47,510 --> 01:04:48,473
See you, Matt.

1509
01:04:52,867 --> 01:04:54,113
- Nice.

1510
01:04:55,050 --> 01:04:56,288
- What are you doing, man?

1511
01:04:56,288 --> 01:04:57,120
- What?

1512
01:04:57,120 --> 01:04:57,953
- What'd you say to Ruthie?

1513
01:04:57,953 --> 01:04:59,603
- Nothing, absolutely nothing.

1514
01:05:01,160 --> 01:05:03,380
She kept asking me questions.

1515
01:05:03,380 --> 01:05:05,500
- There's nothing going on
here, absolutely nothing.

1516
01:05:05,500 --> 01:05:06,983
- No, yeah, I can see that.

1517
01:05:08,790 --> 01:05:11,870
- I have to tell you something
before we get in there, okay?

1518
01:05:11,870 --> 01:05:13,585
- What are you talking about?

1519
01:05:13,585 --> 01:05:15,060
(clearing throat)

1520
01:05:15,060 --> 01:05:17,563
- Joel has a girlfriend, okay?

1521
01:05:17,563 --> 01:05:20,018
- What do you mean, that's impossible.

1522
01:05:20,018 --> 01:05:21,390
- No, no, it's not impossible.

1523
01:05:21,390 --> 01:05:22,880
Trust me, they all do it.

1524
01:05:22,880 --> 01:05:25,030
- Why would you say
something like that, Ruthie?

1525
01:05:25,030 --> 01:05:27,260
They don't all do it, Joel doesn't do it.

1526
01:05:27,260 --> 01:05:28,280
Where did you hear that?

1527
01:05:28,280 --> 01:05:31,930
- Someone saw him with
someone at Adolpho's.

1528
01:05:31,930 --> 01:05:33,270
- Who saw him?

1529
01:05:33,270 --> 01:05:35,640
- Matt Muglich saw him
with a very attractive

1530
01:05:35,640 --> 01:05:37,498
blonde woman at Adolpho's.

1531
01:05:38,438 --> 01:05:41,348
- At Adolpho's, what, in the lounge?

1532
01:05:42,490 --> 01:05:44,520
Were they at the table by the fireplace?

1533
01:05:44,520 --> 01:05:45,353
Is that where they were?

1534
01:05:45,353 --> 01:05:47,047
You know, that's where he proposed to me.

1535
01:05:47,047 --> 01:05:48,385
I can't believe it, at Adolpho's?

1536
01:05:48,385 --> 01:05:49,520
- Sh, sh, sh.

1537
01:05:49,520 --> 01:05:51,770
And at the racquetball place, okay,

1538
01:05:51,770 --> 01:05:53,350
but I'm backing out now.

1539
01:05:53,350 --> 01:05:55,230
This is really, it's an
issue for you and Joel.

1540
01:05:55,230 --> 01:05:56,650
All right, so.

1541
01:05:56,650 --> 01:05:57,700
- [Eldon] Ruthie, how are you?

1542
01:05:57,700 --> 01:05:58,533
- Hi, Eldon.

1543
01:06:00,720 --> 01:06:02,420
Dr. Krantz (clears throat).

1544
01:06:02,420 --> 01:06:04,470
- And Mrs. Kaplan, it's lovely to see you.

1545
01:06:04,470 --> 01:06:06,853
And I'm guessing this
would be Joel and Sharon.

1546
01:06:07,750 --> 01:06:09,520
Mr. Kaplan, how are you?

1547
01:06:09,520 --> 01:06:11,210
May I call you Sam?

1548
01:06:11,210 --> 01:06:12,750
- Stay with Mr. Kaplan.

1549
01:06:12,750 --> 01:06:13,780
That's what you called me when you

1550
01:06:13,780 --> 01:06:15,630
were trying to get into Ruthie's pants.

1551
01:06:15,630 --> 01:06:17,000
- Daddy.

1552
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:17,833
- Please.

1553
01:06:19,810 --> 01:06:21,120
- Okay.

1554
01:06:21,120 --> 01:06:23,390
- I realize it might seem unwieldy,

1555
01:06:23,390 --> 01:06:25,940
all of us meeting like this,
but it's been my experience

1556
01:06:25,940 --> 01:06:29,830
that getting together as a
family is almost essential

1557
01:06:29,830 --> 01:06:32,963
if we're going to have a
chance to sort things out.

1558
01:06:35,240 --> 01:06:38,390
Now, we all have things
bottled up inside us.

1559
01:06:38,390 --> 01:06:41,990
It's like, um, like a spider's web.

1560
01:06:41,990 --> 01:06:45,360
And we have to find a
way to unravel the thread

1561
01:06:45,360 --> 01:06:48,753
so we can find our way
out of the labyrinth.

1562
01:06:48,753 --> 01:06:49,585
(scoffing)

1563
01:06:49,585 --> 01:06:51,170
- Daddy, Daddy, it's a metaphor.

1564
01:06:51,170 --> 01:06:52,710
- I know it's a metaphor.

1565
01:06:52,710 --> 01:06:54,640
- I only intended that as a metaphor

1566
01:06:54,640 --> 01:06:57,880
for the confusion that we
all feel in our daily lives.

1567
01:06:57,880 --> 01:06:59,228
That's a natsuki.

1568
01:07:00,095 --> 01:07:01,180
- Natsuki?

1569
01:07:01,180 --> 01:07:03,220
- Yeah, of course the Americans tend

1570
01:07:03,220 --> 01:07:04,500
to pronounce it nat-soo-kie,

1571
01:07:04,500 --> 01:07:07,950
but the Japanese prefer it natskay.

1572
01:07:07,950 --> 01:07:10,540
It's, it's quite valuable.

1573
01:07:10,540 --> 01:07:12,090
- At your rates, they could be bigger.

1574
01:07:12,090 --> 01:07:14,183
- Oh my God.

1575
01:07:14,183 --> 01:07:15,723
- Are you okay, Molly?

1576
01:07:17,040 --> 01:07:18,800
- It's fine, I'll be fine in a minute.

1577
01:07:18,800 --> 01:07:21,918
- Would you like some
water or perhaps some tea?

1578
01:07:21,918 --> 01:07:22,752
- Yeah, tea.

1579
01:07:23,645 --> 01:07:26,500
(bell ringing)

1580
01:07:26,500 --> 01:07:27,890
- [Eldon] Marlena, would you bring in

1581
01:07:27,890 --> 01:07:29,543
some tea for Mrs. Kaplan please?

1582
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:32,350
- [Sam] Can I ask a question?

1583
01:07:32,350 --> 01:07:33,830
- That's what we're here for.

1584
01:07:33,830 --> 01:07:36,420
- We all come in this room
here, and you wave your

1585
01:07:36,420 --> 01:07:40,440
magic wand and everything's
gonna be hunky dory?

1586
01:07:40,440 --> 01:07:43,130
- If you had the wand, Sam,

1587
01:07:43,130 --> 01:07:44,220
what would you do with it?

1588
01:07:44,220 --> 01:07:46,220
- Give me that wand for five minutes,

1589
01:07:46,220 --> 01:07:48,250
and I'd show you some changes.

1590
01:07:48,250 --> 01:07:49,493
- I'm going to the bathroom.

1591
01:07:49,493 --> 01:07:50,327
- Me too.

1592
01:07:50,327 --> 01:07:51,820
- Daddy, Joel, sit down.

1593
01:07:51,820 --> 01:07:52,763
Sit down!

1594
01:07:55,570 --> 01:07:59,070
- Admit it, Joel, you're having an affair.

1595
01:07:59,070 --> 01:07:59,903
- Well.

1596
01:08:00,855 --> 01:08:01,688
I don't understand.

1597
01:08:01,688 --> 01:08:04,130
- You're having an affair
with her, aren't you?

1598
01:08:04,130 --> 01:08:06,930
That blonde client, right,
she's the one, isn't she?

1599
01:08:06,930 --> 01:08:10,428
All the talks and the calls in the garage

1600
01:08:10,428 --> 01:08:12,530
and the muttering in your sleep,

1601
01:08:12,530 --> 01:08:15,240
and, oh, they're racquetball games, right?

1602
01:08:15,240 --> 01:08:16,450
Admit it.

1603
01:08:16,450 --> 01:08:18,010
- I haven't done a thing.

1604
01:08:18,010 --> 01:08:20,520
- Oh, I see, you're
just thinking about it?

1605
01:08:20,520 --> 01:08:23,120
- Everybody thinks about
it, thinking doesn't count.

1606
01:08:24,792 --> 01:08:26,760
- I hope I'm not interrupting.

1607
01:08:26,760 --> 01:08:28,410
- No no no, not at all, just put it

1608
01:08:28,410 --> 01:08:30,283
in front of Mrs. Kaplan, please.

1609
01:08:34,400 --> 01:08:35,233
- Thank you.

1610
01:08:36,570 --> 01:08:37,663
- Thank you, Marlena.

1611
01:08:40,360 --> 01:08:43,200
Um, could we just slow down a minute here?

1612
01:08:43,200 --> 01:08:46,320
Ruthie, I thought this was
about your mother and father.

1613
01:08:46,320 --> 01:08:49,220
- It's her, it's her?

1614
01:08:49,220 --> 01:08:50,670
You left me for Marlena?

1615
01:08:50,670 --> 01:08:53,560
- Ruthie, this is hardly
the time or the place.

1616
01:08:53,560 --> 01:08:58,560
- I'm sorry, but that reject
from a Thighmaster infomercial?

1617
01:08:59,420 --> 01:09:02,160
- Ruthie, you and I walked together

1618
01:09:02,160 --> 01:09:06,030
for a few blissful moments,
and then our paths diverged.

1619
01:09:06,030 --> 01:09:07,680
- I told you he was a putz.

1620
01:09:07,680 --> 01:09:09,960
- Yeah, you were a real prick
the way you treated my sister.

1621
01:09:09,960 --> 01:09:11,680
- Yeah, the glass house speaks.

1622
01:09:11,680 --> 01:09:12,830
- You're despicable.

1623
01:09:12,830 --> 01:09:13,863
- I didn't do anything!

1624
01:09:13,863 --> 01:09:14,697
- I don't believe you.

1625
01:09:14,697 --> 01:09:15,530
- I don't either.

1626
01:09:15,530 --> 01:09:17,160
- That's enough outta
you, you've done enough!

1627
01:09:17,160 --> 01:09:18,450
- Hey, you leave her alone.

1628
01:09:18,450 --> 01:09:19,283
- That's right.

1629
01:09:19,283 --> 01:09:20,160
- Stop it, just stop it.

1630
01:09:20,160 --> 01:09:21,840
- Joel, you cheated on Sharon?

1631
01:09:21,840 --> 01:09:24,450
- Pop, I didn't, I swear.

1632
01:09:24,450 --> 01:09:25,780
- If you're having problems.

1633
01:09:25,780 --> 01:09:28,710
- Mr. Problem Solver, what a laugh.

1634
01:09:28,710 --> 01:09:31,590
- Okay, there's nothing to talk about.

1635
01:09:31,590 --> 01:09:33,150
Nothing is going on.

1636
01:09:33,150 --> 01:09:34,220
- You cheater.

1637
01:09:34,220 --> 01:09:35,540
- [Ruthie] I can't believe you.

1638
01:09:35,540 --> 01:09:38,610
- I mean, at Adolpho's, you bastard.

1639
01:09:38,610 --> 01:09:39,443
- Sharon.

1640
01:09:39,443 --> 01:09:40,277
- [Sam] You should talk
to me if you have--

1641
01:09:40,277 --> 01:09:42,970
- It's, it's, it's, there's
nothing to talk about.

1642
01:09:42,970 --> 01:09:45,867
- Joel, Ruthie, Sharon,
Mr. and Mrs. Kaplan,

1643
01:09:45,867 --> 01:09:48,890
can we all calm down for just a moment?

1644
01:09:48,890 --> 01:09:50,290
- Joel, you're pathetic.

1645
01:09:50,290 --> 01:09:51,390
- I'll kill you!

1646
01:09:51,390 --> 01:09:52,450
- I'll kill you.

1647
01:09:52,450 --> 01:09:53,767
(watch beeping)

1648
01:09:53,767 --> 01:09:57,253
- Well, it would seem that our time is up.

1649
01:09:58,447 --> 01:09:59,560
- What do you mean, our time is up?

1650
01:09:59,560 --> 01:10:01,530
- Now now now, let's not get discouraged.

1651
01:10:01,530 --> 01:10:04,190
The first sessions are
usually a bit complicated,

1652
01:10:04,190 --> 01:10:08,890
which is why I prefer to make
them as brief as possible.

1653
01:10:08,890 --> 01:10:13,300
But I think we had a real,
made some real progress here.

1654
01:10:13,300 --> 01:10:17,360
Maybe even a breakthrough.

1655
01:10:17,360 --> 01:10:19,972
Marlena, would you call
Dr. Bienstock for me?

1656
01:10:19,972 --> 01:10:22,430
I'm feeling a lot of tension
in my chest, and I think

1657
01:10:22,430 --> 01:10:25,363
it would be a good idea to
see him as soon as possible.

1658
01:10:26,690 --> 01:10:28,373
- I didn't get to drink my tea.

1659
01:10:35,080 --> 01:10:35,913
- Where's Milo?

1660
01:10:35,913 --> 01:10:36,747
I gotta tell him what happened

1661
01:10:36,747 --> 01:10:38,953
at the shrink doctor's
yesterday, he won't believe it.

1662
01:10:41,070 --> 01:10:42,140
What's the matter?

1663
01:10:42,140 --> 01:10:43,103
- Sit down, Sam.

1664
01:10:44,320 --> 01:10:45,390
- What's wrong?

1665
01:10:45,390 --> 01:10:48,070
- We just heard from Milo's sister.

1666
01:10:48,070 --> 01:10:51,323
She tried to phone you,
but you musta been out.

1667
01:10:52,440 --> 01:10:55,613
Milo was rushed to the
hospital this morning.

1668
01:10:55,613 --> 01:10:57,160
He had a stroke.

1669
01:10:57,160 --> 01:10:57,993
- How is he?

1670
01:11:01,430 --> 01:11:02,723
Oh my God.

1671
01:11:04,160 --> 01:11:04,993
Milo.

1672
01:11:08,040 --> 01:11:09,190
He was meeting me here.

1673
01:11:12,560 --> 01:11:13,883
I have to talk to Milo.

1674
01:11:15,410 --> 01:11:16,603
I need to talk to him.

1675
01:11:20,517 --> 01:11:21,780
(door opening and closing)

1676
01:11:21,780 --> 01:11:22,613
- Sam?

1677
01:11:24,970 --> 01:11:26,690
Are you here?

1678
01:11:26,690 --> 01:11:27,523
Sam?

1679
01:11:29,210 --> 01:11:30,073
Where are you?

1680
01:11:34,240 --> 01:11:37,180
Sam, please, don't do this.

1681
01:11:37,180 --> 01:11:41,183
This, this isn't a time to be alone.

1682
01:11:44,400 --> 01:11:46,823
- The last time I saw
him, we had a big fight.

1683
01:11:48,010 --> 01:11:49,560
- That doesn't matter.

1684
01:11:49,560 --> 01:11:51,840
- He was my best friend.

1685
01:11:51,840 --> 01:11:53,280
He lived alone his whole life,

1686
01:11:53,280 --> 01:11:54,980
and now, when he really needed me,

1687
01:11:56,030 --> 01:11:57,143
I wasn't there.

1688
01:11:58,470 --> 01:12:00,665
- How could you know?

1689
01:12:00,665 --> 01:12:03,415
(hard breathing)

1690
01:12:05,750 --> 01:12:07,350
- I can't put him in the ground.

1691
01:12:10,540 --> 01:12:11,610
Don't look at me.

1692
01:12:11,610 --> 01:12:15,183
- No no, that's okay, go ahead, go ahead.

1693
01:12:15,183 --> 01:12:17,265
(crying)

1694
01:12:21,500 --> 01:12:23,100
- Stay a little while, will you?

1695
01:12:26,630 --> 01:12:28,048
- A little while.

1696
01:12:29,825 --> 01:12:32,658
(soft jazz music)

1697
01:12:52,530 --> 01:12:55,380
- [Priest] Because God has
chosen to call our brother Milo

1698
01:12:55,380 --> 01:12:57,373
from this life to Himself,

1699
01:12:58,400 --> 01:13:00,603
we commit his body to the Earth.

1700
01:13:02,030 --> 01:13:06,670
For we are dust, and unto
dust we shall return.

1701
01:13:06,670 --> 01:13:10,310
Eternal rest, grant unto him, oh Lord,

1702
01:13:10,310 --> 01:13:13,003
and let perpetual light shine upon him.

1703
01:13:14,610 --> 01:13:17,700
May the peace of God, which
is beyond all understanding

1704
01:13:17,700 --> 01:13:20,040
keep your hearts and minds
in the knowledge and love

1705
01:13:20,040 --> 01:13:24,340
of God, and of His son,
our Lord Jesus Christ.

1706
01:13:24,340 --> 01:13:26,060
May almighty God bless you,

1707
01:13:26,060 --> 01:13:29,867
the father, the son and
the Holy Spirit, Amen.

1708
01:13:29,867 --> 01:13:31,330
- Amen.
- Amen.

1709
01:13:31,330 --> 01:13:34,540
- Go in the peace of
Christ, thanks be to God.

1710
01:13:34,540 --> 01:13:37,595
- Thanks be to God.
- Thanks be to God.

1711
01:13:37,595 --> 01:13:40,223
(birds chirping)

1712
01:13:40,223 --> 01:13:42,997
(chattering)

1713
01:13:42,997 --> 01:13:46,663
(doors opening and closing)

1714
01:13:48,323 --> 01:13:49,898
- Daddy, are you okay to go back alone?

1715
01:13:49,898 --> 01:13:51,150
- Yeah, sure.

1716
01:13:51,150 --> 01:13:53,970
So, what about you, Ruthie,
is everything okay with you?

1717
01:13:53,970 --> 01:13:55,420
- Everything's pretty good for a change.

1718
01:13:55,420 --> 01:13:56,270
- That's good.

1719
01:13:56,270 --> 01:13:57,270
- Work's going well.

1720
01:13:58,120 --> 01:13:59,810
- Are you seeing anybody?

1721
01:13:59,810 --> 01:14:01,240
- This guy I work with.

1722
01:14:01,240 --> 01:14:03,560
- Is he a nice fella, is he serious?

1723
01:14:03,560 --> 01:14:06,620
- Well he invited to go to
Mexico with him this weekend.

1724
01:14:06,620 --> 01:14:09,270
- In my day, you invited
someone to go to the movies.

1725
01:14:10,360 --> 01:14:11,960
- Dad, things are different today.

1726
01:14:11,960 --> 01:14:12,960
- You're telling me.

1727
01:14:13,910 --> 01:14:16,060
If he's serious, okay.

1728
01:14:16,060 --> 01:14:18,150
If he wants the honeymoon
before the marriage.

1729
01:14:18,150 --> 01:14:20,373
- Maybe I want the honeymoon
before the marriage.

1730
01:14:21,520 --> 01:14:24,460
- Listen, I want you
to do something for me.

1731
01:14:24,460 --> 01:14:26,490
Tell your mother it's time to come home.

1732
01:14:26,490 --> 01:14:28,260
- Daddy, you have to tell herself.

1733
01:14:29,430 --> 01:14:31,163
- Everything I do makes it worse.

1734
01:14:32,310 --> 01:14:33,880
- You have to keep trying.

1735
01:14:33,880 --> 01:14:35,390
- Yeah.
- Bye.

1736
01:14:35,390 --> 01:14:36,223
- Bye-bye.

1737
01:14:37,778 --> 01:14:39,950
(humming)

1738
01:14:39,950 --> 01:14:42,783
(soft jazz music)

1739
01:14:43,725 --> 01:14:48,372
♪ They went upon their
heavenly honeymoon ♪

1740
01:14:48,372 --> 01:14:51,205
(soft jazz music)

1741
01:14:55,948 --> 01:14:58,705

1742
01:14:58,705 --> 01:15:01,538

(water rippling)

1746
01:15:31,648 --> 01:15:33,173
- What do you think?

1747
01:15:33,173 --> 01:15:34,483
You think she'll go for it?

1748
01:15:35,560 --> 01:15:36,393
Wish me luck.

1749
01:15:38,800 --> 01:15:41,300
- Rudy, how much for a dozen roses?

1750
01:15:41,300 --> 01:15:42,480
- Which ones?

1751
01:15:42,480 --> 01:15:44,450
- Those, the yellow ones, over there.

1752
01:15:44,450 --> 01:15:46,858
- Ahhh, the yellow ones.

1753
01:15:46,858 --> 01:15:48,233
$40 a dozen.

1754
01:15:49,500 --> 01:15:51,500
They come all the way from Chile by air.

1755
01:15:52,970 --> 01:15:54,140
- [Sam] You got any seconds?

1756
01:15:54,140 --> 01:15:57,048
- Are they for someone
special in your life, Sam?

1757
01:15:57,048 --> 01:15:57,882
- Yeah.
- Yeahhhhh.

1758
01:15:57,882 --> 01:15:58,715
- You could so say.

1759
01:15:58,715 --> 01:16:00,013
- Then you gotta buy them.

1760
01:16:00,013 --> 01:16:02,900
When they open up full,
they'll take your breath away.

1761
01:16:02,900 --> 01:16:03,950
They're so beautiful.

1762
01:16:05,870 --> 01:16:07,833
- Well if that's the price of love.

1763
01:16:09,395 --> 01:16:12,143
(doorbell ringing)

1764
01:16:12,143 --> 01:16:14,975
(soft jazz music)

1765
01:16:16,770 --> 01:16:17,603
- Oh, Lou.

1766
01:16:17,603 --> 01:16:19,013
- Hello, Molly.

1767
01:16:19,013 --> 01:16:20,550
- Oh, they're beautiful.

1768
01:16:20,550 --> 01:16:23,000
Let me put them in water before we go.

1769
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:24,350
- Watch out for the thorns.

1770
01:16:25,510 --> 01:16:27,305
I'll give you a hand.

1771
01:16:27,305 --> 01:16:30,305
(upbeat jazz music)

1772
01:16:57,210 --> 01:17:00,265
(doorbell ringing)

1773
01:17:00,265 --> 01:17:01,433
- Papa!
- Papa!

1774
01:17:02,895 --> 01:17:03,728
- Hi ya, honey.

1775
01:17:03,728 --> 01:17:05,272
- Can I smell?

1776
01:17:05,272 --> 01:17:06,105
- Oh sure, there you go.

1777
01:17:06,105 --> 01:17:08,000
- Oh hi, Sam.

1778
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:09,393
Those are so beautiful.

1779
01:17:12,610 --> 01:17:13,543
- Sam.

1780
01:17:14,510 --> 01:17:15,800
How are you?

1781
01:17:15,800 --> 01:17:16,823
- I'm fine.

1782
01:17:17,880 --> 01:17:22,260
- Oh, you remember Lou Moskowitz
from my driving school.

1783
01:17:22,260 --> 01:17:23,173
- Hello, Sam.

1784
01:17:29,500 --> 01:17:32,190
(glass breaking)

1785
01:17:32,190 --> 01:17:33,268
- [Sam] Oops (chuckles).

1786
01:17:34,223 --> 01:17:35,057
- Sorry.

1787
01:17:39,410 --> 01:17:41,730
- Here, sweetheart, these are for you.

1788
01:17:41,730 --> 01:17:44,680
I picked them out special,
because I know you like flowers.

1789
01:17:53,643 --> 01:17:56,475
(slow jazz music)

1790
01:18:13,390 --> 01:18:14,223
- Hello?

1791
01:18:17,480 --> 01:18:18,472
Tracy?

1792
01:18:18,472 --> 01:18:21,305
(slow jazz music)

1793
01:18:23,200 --> 01:18:24,033
Hello?

1794
01:18:27,328 --> 01:18:28,343
Hi.

1795
01:18:28,343 --> 01:18:30,350
- Joel, hi, I didn't expect you.

1796
01:18:30,350 --> 01:18:32,830
- I called your house, your
housekeeper said you were here.

1797
01:18:32,830 --> 01:18:36,460
- Yeah, I was just taking
a last look around.

1798
01:18:36,460 --> 01:18:38,840
Buying a house seemed so easy at first,

1799
01:18:38,840 --> 01:18:42,423
but it really is quite
an emotional experience.

1800
01:18:42,423 --> 01:18:45,510
- I don't know anyone who
doesn't have a moment of panic

1801
01:18:45,510 --> 01:18:47,290
when they make up their mind.

1802
01:18:47,290 --> 01:18:49,107
Are you having any second thoughts?

1803
01:18:49,107 --> 01:18:51,300
- No, no, not really.

1804
01:18:51,300 --> 01:18:52,143
Are you?

1805
01:18:54,603 --> 01:18:56,740
- To tell you the truth, I
have a feeling that I'm in

1806
01:18:56,740 --> 01:18:58,500
something way over my head here.

1807
01:18:58,500 --> 01:19:00,270
That's what I came over to tell you.

1808
01:19:00,270 --> 01:19:02,660
I'm not, I, this is, it's.

1809
01:19:02,660 --> 01:19:05,260
- It's all right, I'm not surprised.

1810
01:19:05,260 --> 01:19:07,330
I knew right after our racquetball game.

1811
01:19:07,330 --> 01:19:09,370
- I'm an idiot, I feel like such a jerk.

1812
01:19:09,370 --> 01:19:10,313
- Don't apologize.

1813
01:19:10,313 --> 01:19:11,770
- Because it's not you, I mean really,

1814
01:19:11,770 --> 01:19:15,110
you're a very desirable
woman, you're lovely.

1815
01:19:15,110 --> 01:19:17,060
- Very desirable.
- It's okay, really.

1816
01:19:17,975 --> 01:19:19,773
- It's just that I, I can't handle it.

1817
01:19:20,670 --> 01:19:22,450
Who knew I'd be such a chicken?

1818
01:19:22,450 --> 01:19:24,230
- These things happen.

1819
01:19:24,230 --> 01:19:25,430
Woulda been fun, though.

1820
01:19:29,670 --> 01:19:31,558
- Thanks for being so--

1821
01:19:31,558 --> 01:19:32,440
- Yeah, bye.

1822
01:19:32,440 --> 01:19:35,053
- Hey, Tracy, you wanna
try out the Jacuzzi?

1823
01:19:37,470 --> 01:19:39,813
Joel, hey, man, how the hell are you?

1824
01:19:41,520 --> 01:19:42,353
I mean, uh.

1825
01:19:44,150 --> 01:19:46,023
See Tracy, Tracy and me, we, uh.

1826
01:19:47,320 --> 01:19:49,120
I mean, let's see, uh, yeah, I called her

1827
01:19:49,120 --> 01:19:51,060
a couple of times to play at the club,

1828
01:19:51,060 --> 01:19:54,050
and then, she called me to you know,

1829
01:19:54,050 --> 01:19:55,610
see the new house, great, great.

1830
01:19:55,610 --> 01:19:58,883
- Hey, hey, Matt, Matt,
it's okay, it's okay.

1831
01:20:00,780 --> 01:20:02,340
- No offense, man, I uh.

1832
01:20:02,340 --> 01:20:03,233
- None taken.

1833
01:20:05,973 --> 01:20:07,580
- Hey.

1834
01:20:07,580 --> 01:20:10,398
Hey, Joel, are we still on for Friday?

1835
01:20:10,398 --> 01:20:12,703
- Hi, Melissa.
- Hi, Billy.

1836
01:20:13,688 --> 01:20:15,280
- I don't like boys.

1837
01:20:15,280 --> 01:20:16,830
- I'm a boy, don't you like me?

1838
01:20:16,830 --> 01:20:19,108
- You're not a boy, you're a Papa.

1839
01:20:20,353 --> 01:20:22,900
I don't like, Billy, he teases me.

1840
01:20:22,900 --> 01:20:24,290
- Sometimes that's how boys tell girls

1841
01:20:24,290 --> 01:20:26,332
they like them, by teasing.

1842
01:20:26,332 --> 01:20:28,970
- I don't like it when he teases me.

1843
01:20:28,970 --> 01:20:29,960
- I tease you sometimes.

1844
01:20:29,960 --> 01:20:31,890
I say, how'd you get so ugly?

1845
01:20:31,890 --> 01:20:33,710
You know I don't mean it.

1846
01:20:33,710 --> 01:20:35,778
I mean, you're so pretty.

1847
01:20:35,778 --> 01:20:36,610
- Papa?

1848
01:20:38,263 --> 01:20:40,373
Why are you mean to Nana?

1849
01:20:41,250 --> 01:20:42,200
- Did she say that?

1850
01:20:43,092 --> 01:20:45,140
- No, but I saw you
yell at her lotsa times.

1851
01:20:45,140 --> 01:20:47,010
That's why she came to stay with us.

1852
01:20:48,933 --> 01:20:50,333
- Well, I'll try to explain.

1853
01:20:51,400 --> 01:20:53,973
Sometimes, even when people want to,

1854
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:56,763
they can't find a way to get along.

1855
01:20:57,990 --> 01:21:00,373
Sometimes, even when they try real hard,

1856
01:21:02,370 --> 01:21:03,903
they can't make it work out.

1857
01:21:05,770 --> 01:21:06,883
- Can I go play?

1858
01:21:10,250 --> 01:21:11,763
- I want you to remember me.

1859
01:21:13,080 --> 01:21:14,893
- I remember you, Papa.

1860
01:21:17,030 --> 01:21:18,453
- Play.

1861
01:21:18,453 --> 01:21:21,238
(children chattering)

1862
01:21:21,238 --> 01:21:24,238
(upbeat jazz music)

1863
01:21:37,688 --> 01:21:40,140
(horn honking)

1864
01:21:40,140 --> 01:21:43,140
(upbeat jazz music)

1865
01:21:49,775 --> 01:21:52,358
(horn honking)

1866
01:21:55,890 --> 01:21:57,090
- What's all this stuff?

1867
01:21:57,090 --> 01:22:00,250
Fuzzy antlers, little dried up seahorses.

1868
01:22:00,250 --> 01:22:01,510
What do you tell people?

1869
01:22:01,510 --> 01:22:03,530
Take two of these and call in the morning.

1870
01:22:03,530 --> 01:22:04,970
- I recognize you.

1871
01:22:04,970 --> 01:22:06,500
- [Sam] Yeah, this used to be my store.

1872
01:22:06,500 --> 01:22:07,440
- Yeah, I know that.

1873
01:22:07,440 --> 01:22:09,100
- I just came by to look around.

1874
01:22:09,100 --> 01:22:11,700
- Oh, look around, take your time.

1875
01:22:11,700 --> 01:22:13,260
- What happened to the rest of it?

1876
01:22:13,260 --> 01:22:15,360
- I put it all up the middle,

1877
01:22:15,360 --> 01:22:18,050
and my son-in-law has the
shop on the other side.

1878
01:22:18,050 --> 01:22:18,883
- Uh-huh.

1879
01:22:20,350 --> 01:22:21,183
Mm-hmm.

1880
01:22:22,790 --> 01:22:23,650
How's business?

1881
01:22:23,650 --> 01:22:26,063
- Good, good, I can't complain.

1882
01:22:27,470 --> 01:22:28,430
- This stuff works?

1883
01:22:28,430 --> 01:22:29,600
- Of course it works.

1884
01:22:29,600 --> 01:22:34,000
Look at all this, gensing,
goli, and rhinoceros horn.

1885
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:35,290
- Rhinoceros horn?

1886
01:22:35,290 --> 01:22:37,880
- Yeah, powerful stuff.

1887
01:22:37,880 --> 01:22:39,470
Do you have an ailment?

1888
01:22:39,470 --> 01:22:41,433
- I have a bum knee, nothing helps.

1889
01:22:42,290 --> 01:22:44,983
- And, uh, how is your erection?

1890
01:22:45,868 --> 01:22:47,560
(chuckling)

1891
01:22:47,560 --> 01:22:48,393
- How's yours?

1892
01:22:49,970 --> 01:22:53,163
- Oh, I have something, just
the thing for your knee.

1893
01:22:54,620 --> 01:22:56,460
Read the direction,

1894
01:22:56,460 --> 01:22:58,158
although it's in Chinese.

1895
01:22:58,158 --> 01:23:00,908
(water rippling)

1896
01:23:02,120 --> 01:23:04,450
- They've been using it
in China over 1,000 years.

1897
01:23:04,450 --> 01:23:06,480
They must know something.

1898
01:23:06,480 --> 01:23:08,720
What would you know about knees?

1899
01:23:08,720 --> 01:23:10,380
You've been spending your
whole life swimming around

1900
01:23:10,380 --> 01:23:12,490
with millions of other fish.

1901
01:23:12,490 --> 01:23:14,473
Swoosh, swoosh, swoosh with your tail.

1902
01:23:15,480 --> 01:23:17,773
Me, I spent my whole life with one woman.

1903
01:23:18,900 --> 01:23:20,560
You think that's easy?

1904
01:23:20,560 --> 01:23:21,943
You try it sometime.

1905
01:23:23,260 --> 01:23:25,230
Then she walks out on me.

1906
01:23:25,230 --> 01:23:27,783
Picks up with some
nobody with a fancy car.

1907
01:23:28,950 --> 01:23:30,830
I should never have let
her take driving lessons.

1908
01:23:30,830 --> 01:23:32,600
That was my first mistake.

1909
01:23:32,600 --> 01:23:35,370
Take my advice, you meet
a nice lady fish someday,

1910
01:23:35,370 --> 01:23:40,038
she asks you for swimming
lessons, say no, immediately.

1911
01:23:40,038 --> 01:23:43,038
(upbeat jazz music)

1912
01:24:07,993 --> 01:24:09,960
- Come on, guys, come on.

1913
01:24:09,960 --> 01:24:12,960
(upbeat jazz music)

1914
01:24:16,572 --> 01:24:17,408
Come on.

1915
01:24:17,408 --> 01:24:20,408
(upbeat jazz music)

1916
01:24:35,953 --> 01:24:38,458
- Congratulations, Rose.

1917
01:24:38,458 --> 01:24:39,875
- Thanks, Ruthie.

1918
01:24:39,875 --> 01:24:42,875
(upbeat jazz music)

1919
01:24:49,983 --> 01:24:51,060
- Hello, Joel.

1920
01:24:51,060 --> 01:24:52,703
Party, Joel, hi, Sharon.

1921
01:24:55,400 --> 01:24:56,550
- You wanna dance?

1922
01:24:56,550 --> 01:24:57,383
- I don't think so.

1923
01:24:57,383 --> 01:24:58,630
- Why, you always liked to dance.

1924
01:24:58,630 --> 01:25:00,490
- Yeah, well, that was before.

1925
01:25:00,490 --> 01:25:01,410
- Before what?

1926
01:25:01,410 --> 01:25:05,590
- Before that woman, that
blonde woman with the big tits.

1927
01:25:05,590 --> 01:25:06,940
- She didn't have big tits.

1928
01:25:08,470 --> 01:25:09,553
- You did, didn't you?

1929
01:25:09,553 --> 01:25:10,387
- I didn't.

1930
01:25:10,387 --> 01:25:12,353
I swear, I'd kill myself if I did.

1931
01:25:13,207 --> 01:25:14,857
- All right, you better not have.

1932
01:25:16,567 --> 01:25:17,598
- Oh, ow.

1933
01:25:17,598 --> 01:25:20,598
(upbeat jazz music)

1934
01:25:23,617 --> 01:25:26,367
(light applause)

1935
01:25:28,948 --> 01:25:31,110
- Sam, how are you?

1936
01:25:31,110 --> 01:25:33,400
We missed you at the forum carnival.

1937
01:25:33,400 --> 01:25:36,043
Melissa was an absolutely
adorable Queen Esther.

1938
01:25:37,870 --> 01:25:42,170
Sam, I hear you and Molly
are having difficulties.

1939
01:25:42,170 --> 01:25:44,920
If there's anything I
can do, anything at all.

1940
01:25:44,920 --> 01:25:46,640
- Look, Rabbi, I know you mean well.

1941
01:25:46,640 --> 01:25:47,543
- Talk to me, Sam.

1942
01:25:48,760 --> 01:25:51,780
We're old friends, under
the same person up there.

1943
01:25:51,780 --> 01:25:53,100
- Hello, Rabbi.

1944
01:25:53,100 --> 01:25:54,190
- Hello, hello.

1945
01:25:54,190 --> 01:25:57,010
- Hello, Sam, it's a
grand affair, isn't it?

1946
01:25:57,010 --> 01:25:57,923
- Oh just grand.

1947
01:25:58,830 --> 01:26:01,020
- Doesn't Molly look lovely tonight?

1948
01:26:01,898 --> 01:26:04,898
(upbeat jazz music)

1949
01:26:11,788 --> 01:26:14,690
She was just telling me
about her First Communion.

1950
01:26:14,690 --> 01:26:16,290
Oh, you win some, you lose some.

1951
01:26:17,285 --> 01:26:20,285
(upbeat jazz music)

1952
01:26:21,333 --> 01:26:24,017
- Pop, I wasn't sure you'd
make it, how you doing?

1953
01:26:24,017 --> 01:26:25,325
- I'm doing fine.

1954
01:26:25,325 --> 01:26:28,325
(upbeat jazz music)

1955
01:26:30,723 --> 01:26:33,383
(chattering)

1956
01:26:33,383 --> 01:26:36,383
(upbeat jazz music)

1957
01:26:38,160 --> 01:26:39,405
Okayyyy.

1958
01:26:39,405 --> 01:26:42,405
(upbeat jazz music)

1959
01:26:46,527 --> 01:26:47,758
Silvia, let's dance.

1960
01:26:47,758 --> 01:26:48,592
- Sure.

1961
01:26:48,592 --> 01:26:51,592
(upbeat jazz music)

1962
01:27:00,383 --> 01:27:03,630
- You can drive a car,
what else can you do?

1963
01:27:03,630 --> 01:27:05,543
- Sam, you're embarrassing me.

1964
01:27:06,868 --> 01:27:08,010
(grunting)

1965
01:27:08,010 --> 01:27:08,843
Sam.

1966
01:27:09,838 --> 01:27:12,337
- [Sam] You and your fancy Town Car.

1967
01:27:12,337 --> 01:27:13,942
- Will you stop it?

1968
01:27:13,942 --> 01:27:15,393
Everybody is staring.

1969
01:27:15,393 --> 01:27:18,200
- Think flowers and a fancy
car can get you somewhere?

1970
01:27:18,200 --> 01:27:20,340
I've been married to
this woman for 40 years.

1971
01:27:20,340 --> 01:27:22,718
We got a lifetime
wrapped up in each other.

1972
01:27:22,718 --> 01:27:25,888
You think can just come in
and take off just like that?

1973
01:27:25,888 --> 01:27:27,240
You got another thing coming.

1974
01:27:27,240 --> 01:27:30,373
I ain't the appetizer, and
you ain't the main course.

1975
01:27:31,823 --> 01:27:34,147
(upbeat jazz music)

1976
01:27:34,147 --> 01:27:34,980
If you know what's good for you,

1977
01:27:34,980 --> 01:27:36,120
you won't hang around anymore.

1978
01:27:36,120 --> 01:27:37,413
Do we understand each other?

1979
01:27:39,390 --> 01:27:42,080
Mosowitz, have you met Silvia Rosen.

1980
01:27:42,080 --> 01:27:43,390
She collects birds.

1981
01:27:43,390 --> 01:27:44,223
- How do you do?

1982
01:27:44,223 --> 01:27:45,160
- Silvia, this is Lou Moskowitz.

1983
01:27:45,160 --> 01:27:46,520
He wants to dance with you.

1984
01:27:46,520 --> 01:27:47,638
- Oh, ho ho.

1985
01:27:49,730 --> 01:27:50,730
- You collect birds?

1986
01:27:52,120 --> 01:27:55,440
- My late husband, Jack,
was a bird fancier.

1987
01:27:55,440 --> 01:27:56,870
- Oh.

1988
01:27:56,870 --> 01:27:58,563
Any particular species?

1989
01:27:59,810 --> 01:28:01,460
- Any kind of species (chuckles).

1990
01:28:03,948 --> 01:28:07,255
(upbeat jazz music)

1991
01:28:07,255 --> 01:28:08,940
- Can I have this dance?

1992
01:28:08,940 --> 01:28:09,838
- I don't think so.

1993
01:28:09,838 --> 01:28:10,670
- Why not?

1994
01:28:11,660 --> 01:28:13,890
- Because you're a bully.

1995
01:28:13,890 --> 01:28:16,060
- I was just protecting what's mine.

1996
01:28:16,060 --> 01:28:18,100
- I don't belong to you.

1997
01:28:18,100 --> 01:28:18,933
- I know that.

1998
01:28:21,237 --> 01:28:23,463
You like that Moskowitz fella?

1999
01:28:23,463 --> 01:28:24,490
(scoffing)

2000
01:28:24,490 --> 01:28:25,930
I'm asking you a simple question.

2001
01:28:25,930 --> 01:28:27,460
If the answer is no, fine.

2002
01:28:27,460 --> 01:28:28,713
If the answer is yes,

2003
01:28:30,040 --> 01:28:31,143
I'll break his neck.

2004
01:28:32,870 --> 01:28:35,040
- Mr. Tough Guy, huh?

2005
01:28:35,040 --> 01:28:37,370
For your information, he asked
me out a couple of times,

2006
01:28:37,370 --> 01:28:38,583
that's all, and I went.

2007
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:42,760
- So, I could ask you out.

2008
01:28:44,918 --> 01:28:46,308
- So who's stopping you?

2009
01:28:53,442 --> 01:28:56,920
Oh, Sam, your heart is pounding.

2010
01:28:56,920 --> 01:28:58,320
- On the day I asked you to marry me,

2011
01:28:58,320 --> 01:29:00,543
my heart was pounding exactly that way.

2012
01:29:01,380 --> 01:29:02,923
I was scared outta my skin.

2013
01:29:04,040 --> 01:29:07,023
If you hate me, I wouldn't blame you.

2014
01:29:08,780 --> 01:29:10,093
- Is that what you think?

2015
01:29:11,508 --> 01:29:14,530
- How can it be we're apart?

2016
01:29:14,530 --> 01:29:16,770
- Because you treated me so badly.

2017
01:29:16,770 --> 01:29:18,163
Because I got angry.

2018
01:29:20,993 --> 01:29:23,300
Because you forgot.

2019
01:29:23,300 --> 01:29:24,503
- I never forgot.

2020
01:29:25,660 --> 01:29:28,003
I've been faithful to you all my life.

2021
01:29:29,200 --> 01:29:32,913
Even my fantasies, they
were always about you.

2022
01:29:35,188 --> 01:29:36,088
- [Molly] Oh, Sam.

2023
01:29:37,890 --> 01:29:39,040
- Don't you understand?

2024
01:29:40,290 --> 01:29:42,503
Nothing can take you out of me.

2025
01:29:44,130 --> 01:29:47,440
Wherever I look inside me, you're there.

2026
01:29:47,440 --> 01:29:50,273
(slow jazz music)

2027
01:30:23,178 --> 01:30:24,012
- Yuck.

2028
01:30:24,012 --> 01:30:27,067
(slow jazz music)

2029
01:30:27,067 --> 01:30:29,493
- Did you know that in the Oriente,

2030
01:30:29,493 --> 01:30:33,270
there are more than 300
members of the parrot family?

2031
01:30:33,270 --> 01:30:34,103
- No.

2032
01:30:37,090 --> 01:30:41,330
- Notice, I didn't say, Orient.

2033
01:30:41,330 --> 01:30:42,163
- No no no.

2034
01:30:42,163 --> 01:30:44,750
- I said, Oriente.

2035
01:30:44,750 --> 01:30:47,228
Which is in Venezuela.

2036
01:30:47,228 --> 01:30:50,228
(upbeat jazz music)

2037
01:30:58,428 --> 01:31:01,760
- Oh my, so that's the one.

2038
01:31:01,760 --> 01:31:04,953
- Look how he looks at her, for now.

2039
01:31:04,953 --> 01:31:07,953
(upbeat jazz music)

2040
01:31:19,270 --> 01:31:21,360
- The yellow roses were for you.

2041
01:31:21,360 --> 01:31:22,840
- I knew that, Sam.

2042
01:31:22,840 --> 01:31:25,258
- Red roses, a dime a dozen.

2043
01:31:25,258 --> 01:31:28,258
(upbeat jazz music)

2044
01:31:52,760 --> 01:31:53,963
- [Sam] So long, fish.

2045
01:31:56,640 --> 01:31:58,623
- You kept the fish all this time.

2046
01:31:59,820 --> 01:32:01,320
- I needed someone to talk to.

2047
01:32:03,210 --> 01:32:05,263
- Look, he took off in such a hurry.

2048
01:32:07,110 --> 01:32:09,078
- He's been away a while.

2049
01:32:09,078 --> 01:32:10,943
He's gonna catch hell from somebody.

2050
01:32:10,943 --> 01:32:13,275
(chuckling)

2051
01:32:14,668 --> 01:32:18,840
- The Katzes invited us down
to their new place in Sarasota.

2052
01:32:18,840 --> 01:32:20,360
- [Sam] Have a good time.

2053
01:32:20,360 --> 01:32:21,993
- [Molly] I plan to.

2054
01:32:21,993 --> 01:32:24,148
The water's warm down there.

2055
01:32:24,148 --> 01:32:26,210
You can walk for miles along the beach.

2056
01:32:26,210 --> 01:32:27,960
- [Sam] I'm not going.

2057
01:32:27,960 --> 01:32:30,910
They got sharks there, giant turtles.

2058
01:32:30,910 --> 01:32:32,660
- [Molly] I'll send you a postcard.
