183
00:12:02,031 --> 00:12:04,516
Oh, but you two
aren't, of course.

184
00:12:04,551 --> 00:12:05,241
- Well--

185
00:12:05,276 --> 00:12:08,624
- We recently moved in together.

186
00:12:08,658 --> 00:12:09,418
- Oh.

187
00:12:14,009 --> 00:12:16,218
Well, how's your
mother, sweetie?

188
00:12:16,252 --> 00:12:17,875
- Oh, she's good.

189
00:12:19,739 --> 00:12:21,637
- The pastor will
be with you shortly.

190
00:12:21,671 --> 00:12:22,880
Right this way.

191
00:12:24,882 --> 00:12:26,849
Just in here, have a seat.

192
00:12:26,884 --> 00:12:28,023
- [Lauren] Thanks.

193
00:12:28,057 --> 00:12:28,886
- Sure.

194
00:12:31,336 --> 00:12:33,545
And we'll see you Sunday?

195
00:12:37,239 --> 00:12:39,551
- [Ansel] Doubt it.

196
00:12:39,586 --> 00:12:40,380
- Stop it.

197
00:12:42,347 --> 00:12:43,555
- I knew this was a bad idea.

198
00:12:43,590 --> 00:12:45,316
- This was not a bad idea, okay?

199
00:12:45,350 --> 00:12:48,491
Just quit being so negative.

200
00:12:48,526 --> 00:12:49,527
Please.

201
00:12:50,252 --> 00:12:52,185
- Praise the Lord.

202
00:12:52,219 --> 00:12:53,565
- [Lauren] Hi, Pastor!

203
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:54,601
- How you doin'?

204
00:12:54,635 --> 00:12:55,809
- [Lauren] I'm
good, how are you?

205
00:12:55,844 --> 00:12:57,569
- I'm doin' wonderful,
good to see you.

206
00:12:57,604 --> 00:12:58,398
- Yes.

207
00:13:00,262 --> 00:13:01,159
- How you do?

208
00:13:01,194 --> 00:13:02,160
- Pastor Smith.

209
00:13:02,195 --> 00:13:03,437
- Good, good to see you as well.

210
00:13:03,472 --> 00:13:04,473
- Mm-hm.

211
00:13:10,272 --> 00:13:11,860
- So, I remember

212
00:13:11,894 --> 00:13:14,621
when you was just a little
somethin' boppin' around.

213
00:13:14,655 --> 00:13:16,071
Look at you now.

214
00:13:16,105 --> 00:13:17,589
You're getting married.

215
00:13:17,624 --> 00:13:18,452
- I know.

216
00:13:21,145 --> 00:13:24,527
- So tell me about your
plans for the future?

217
00:13:24,562 --> 00:13:25,321
- Uh.

218
00:13:26,288 --> 00:13:28,359
That's a little broad.

219
00:13:28,393 --> 00:13:29,636
- What about the children?

220
00:13:29,670 --> 00:13:33,088
- Oh, well we both agreed
that we wanna have kids

221
00:13:33,122 --> 00:13:34,261
in a couple of years.

222
00:13:34,296 --> 00:13:38,265
- Yes, first a little
boy, then a little girl.

223
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:42,200
- Or a little girl
and a little boy.

224
00:13:42,235 --> 00:13:44,202
- No, honey, remember?

225
00:13:44,237 --> 00:13:45,790
We talked about this.

226
00:13:45,825 --> 00:13:47,757
You said it would be
nice for our daughter

227
00:13:47,792 --> 00:13:50,622
to have an older brother
so he could protect her.

228
00:13:50,657 --> 00:13:53,384
- But an older sister can
protect a little brother

229
00:13:53,418 --> 00:13:55,282
just as well as an older brother

230
00:13:55,317 --> 00:13:57,112
can protect a little sister.

231
00:13:57,146 --> 00:13:58,423
- Well, you two
really understand

232
00:13:58,458 --> 00:14:01,116
that you really have no
absolutely no control

233
00:14:01,150 --> 00:14:03,635
which one really comes first.

234
00:14:03,670 --> 00:14:04,498
Amen?

235
00:14:06,155 --> 00:14:06,949
- Yes.

236
00:14:06,984 --> 00:14:08,640
- [chuckles] Amen.

237
00:14:08,675 --> 00:14:09,814
- So, okay.

238
00:14:09,849 --> 00:14:12,334
We got the money squared
away and the kids.

239
00:14:12,368 --> 00:14:15,406
So tell me, what
about premarital sex?

240
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:16,269
- Oh, that's great.

241
00:14:16,303 --> 00:14:17,304
Love that.

242
00:14:17,339 --> 00:14:18,512
- You know what, Pastor?

243
00:14:18,547 --> 00:14:23,138
We are going to be
abstaining starting today

244
00:14:23,172 --> 00:14:24,622
until the wedding.

245
00:14:24,656 --> 00:14:25,347
- We are?

246
00:14:25,381 --> 00:14:26,382
- We are.

247
00:14:28,350 --> 00:14:31,491
- What exactly do
you mean about?

248
00:14:33,355 --> 00:14:34,977
- [Lauren] Not here, okay?

249
00:14:35,012 --> 00:14:36,116
- As I was saying,

250
00:14:36,151 --> 00:14:37,842
there are going to always
be trials and tribulations.

251
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:40,258
But so long as the both
parties and persons

252
00:14:40,293 --> 00:14:42,260
have something to
hold them accountable

253
00:14:42,295 --> 00:14:43,848
for their actions and
the risk of misdeeds

254
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:47,093
and other infidelities
lessens greatly.

255
00:14:47,127 --> 00:14:48,266
- You know what, Pastor,

256
00:14:48,301 --> 00:14:49,336
I'm really glad that
you brought that up

257
00:14:49,371 --> 00:14:53,168
because I made it very,
very clear to Ansel

258
00:14:53,202 --> 00:14:55,722
that I will not
tolerate cheating.

259
00:14:55,756 --> 00:14:57,137
- Oh, and realize that cheating

260
00:14:57,172 --> 00:14:58,380
is not always a
deal breaker, honey.

261
00:14:58,414 --> 00:15:00,106
- Yes, it is.

262
00:15:00,140 --> 00:15:01,348
It is to me.

263
00:15:01,383 --> 00:15:03,523
I mean, I've been on
the receiving end,

264
00:15:03,557 --> 00:15:06,664
and I just will
not put up with it.

265
00:15:07,665 --> 00:15:12,221
- Baby, I would never
do anything to hurt you.

266
00:15:12,256 --> 00:15:14,051
- Never say never, Ansel.

267
00:15:14,085 --> 00:15:15,707
- I'm saying never.

268
00:15:17,054 --> 00:15:18,883
You know I love you.

269
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:21,403
- And I love you, too,
but all I'm saying--

270
00:15:21,437 --> 00:15:24,406
- But, where's this but
coming from, all of a sudden?

271
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:27,581
- But I won't deal
with it again.

272
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:30,412
- If you both have
respect for one another,

273
00:15:30,446 --> 00:15:33,208
there should be no
reason for either of you

274
00:15:33,242 --> 00:15:35,175
to need to stray.

275
00:15:35,210 --> 00:15:38,316
You should be able to ask
Ansel for whatever he's lacking

276
00:15:38,351 --> 00:15:39,939
and vice-a versa.

277
00:15:41,423 --> 00:15:42,907
- You're right.

278
00:15:44,081 --> 00:15:45,151
- Of course he's right.

279
00:15:45,185 --> 00:15:46,635
He's a man of God.

280
00:15:50,432 --> 00:15:53,262
- Great, now I know Lauren
is here on a weekly basis.

281
00:15:53,297 --> 00:15:55,644
But Ansel, what about you?

282
00:15:56,541 --> 00:15:58,405
- Yes, I know, Pastor.

283
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:01,546
And believe me,
I will come more,

284
00:16:02,651 --> 00:16:04,894
it's just first I gotta
take care of some things--

285
00:16:04,929 --> 00:16:10,245
- Great, then I'll see the
both of you all Sunday.

286
00:16:10,279 --> 00:16:11,073
Sunday?

287
00:16:11,108 --> 00:16:12,005
- See you Sunday.

288
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:13,558
- Sunday, great.

289
00:16:18,391 --> 00:16:20,082
- Oh, this is a nice store.

290
00:16:20,117 --> 00:16:22,257
- I know, I'm tryin' to
redo the whole living room,

291
00:16:22,291 --> 00:16:24,776
but I wanna start with the rugs.

292
00:16:24,811 --> 00:16:27,710
But I'm lookin' for something
with some orange in it.

293
00:16:27,745 --> 00:16:29,402
- Well, they have so
much stuff in here.

294
00:16:29,436 --> 00:16:30,437
- I know.

295
00:16:30,472 --> 00:16:32,301
This is cute.

296
00:16:32,336 --> 00:16:33,613
- Girl, no that is not.

297
00:16:33,647 --> 00:16:35,408
That look like wolf hair,
dog hair or something.

298
00:16:35,442 --> 00:16:36,305
- Shut up.

299
00:16:36,340 --> 00:16:39,067
[women giggle]

300
00:16:39,101 --> 00:16:40,275
- Stupid.

301
00:16:40,309 --> 00:16:42,104
Now, this is nice, though.

302
00:16:42,139 --> 00:16:45,107
- Mm, that look more like you.

303
00:16:45,142 --> 00:16:46,246
No offense.

304
00:16:46,281 --> 00:16:47,075
- Uh-huh.

305
00:16:48,973 --> 00:16:51,389
- That's cute, I'm gonna
write that down, Stardust.

306
00:16:51,424 --> 00:16:54,047
Now, what were you
sayin' about Lorenzo?

307
00:16:54,082 --> 00:16:55,290
- Oh, girl, I don't know

308
00:16:55,324 --> 00:16:56,981
I just basically
fail to understand

309
00:16:57,016 --> 00:16:59,639
why I have to be the
one to apologize first.

310
00:16:59,673 --> 00:17:01,986
He's just too sensitive.

311
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:03,229
I don't understand that.

312
00:17:03,263 --> 00:17:06,646
I mean, is it my fault he can't
take instructive criticism?

313
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:07,612
[Lauren chuckles]

314
00:17:07,647 --> 00:17:08,510
And he's a man anyway.

315
00:17:08,544 --> 00:17:10,270
Ain't he supposed to be tough?

316
00:17:10,305 --> 00:17:11,340
Whatever.

317
00:17:11,375 --> 00:17:13,170
- Now Misty, you know
you are not known

318
00:17:13,204 --> 00:17:16,276
for your constructive criticism.

319
00:17:16,311 --> 00:17:18,416
- And what is that
supposed to mean?

320
00:17:18,451 --> 00:17:19,969
- I'm just sayin'

321
00:17:20,004 --> 00:17:22,696
that sometimes you lack a
little thing called tact.

322
00:17:22,731 --> 00:17:23,456
- Who?

323
00:17:23,490 --> 00:17:24,491
Me?

324
00:17:24,526 --> 00:17:26,114
Girl.
- Who, yes, you.

325
00:17:26,148 --> 00:17:28,254
- No, I have tact.

326
00:17:28,288 --> 00:17:30,359
I'm sorry, I have tact.

327
00:17:30,394 --> 00:17:31,878
- Tell the truth
and shame the devil.

328
00:17:31,912 --> 00:17:34,156
- [Woman] Okay, okay,
it's such a thing now.

329
00:17:34,191 --> 00:17:36,503
- Nobody asked you anyway.

330
00:17:36,538 --> 00:17:37,366
- Now, you guys.
- Can I get black?

331
00:17:37,401 --> 00:17:38,195
- Can you get black?

332
00:17:38,229 --> 00:17:39,265
No, you--

333
00:17:39,299 --> 00:17:40,197
- Can I get blue?

334
00:17:40,231 --> 00:17:41,163
- Can you?
No, no, no.

335
00:17:41,198 --> 00:17:42,440
- [Child] Can I get pink?

336
00:17:42,475 --> 00:17:43,683
- We're gonna have one
color in the whole house.

337
00:17:43,717 --> 00:17:44,546
We can't have blue
and pink and black.

338
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:46,030
- Oh, uh-uh.

339
00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:47,445
Girl, did she really
come out the house

340
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:49,378
with rollers in her head?

341
00:17:49,413 --> 00:17:50,655
- Yes, she did.

342
00:17:52,726 --> 00:17:56,558
- Don't you worry about
what it is I'm doing.

343
00:17:56,592 --> 00:17:58,560
- Who you talkin' to?

344
00:18:00,217 --> 00:18:01,183
[Lauren giggles]

345
00:18:01,218 --> 00:18:03,875
- You are the one came
outside all unprepared.

346
00:18:03,910 --> 00:18:05,187
- Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.

347
00:18:05,222 --> 00:18:06,050
- What?

348
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:07,258
She don't know me.

349
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:12,643
- Misty, see?

350
00:18:12,677 --> 00:18:13,368
That is exactly what
I'm talkin' about.

351
00:18:13,402 --> 00:18:14,886
- Whatever.

352
00:18:14,921 --> 00:18:17,096
- You need to learn to give
constructive criticism.

353
00:18:17,130 --> 00:18:18,235
- You know she was wrong.

354
00:18:18,269 --> 00:18:20,375
- I mean, even if she was wrong.

355
00:18:20,409 --> 00:18:22,066
And she was wrong for that.

356
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:23,067
- I know she was.

357
00:18:23,102 --> 00:18:26,381
- But it's not up to
you to tell her, okay?

358
00:18:26,415 --> 00:18:27,589
Just chill out.

359
00:18:27,623 --> 00:18:29,591
- I got you, I got you.

360
00:18:29,625 --> 00:18:32,076
But anyway, what I was
sayin' about Lorenzo,

361
00:18:32,111 --> 00:18:33,215

- Mm-mm.

899
00:48:07,125 --> 00:48:08,333
- Guardian angel.

900
00:48:08,368 --> 00:48:11,198
- Get you some rest, okay?

901
00:48:11,233 --> 00:48:12,959
And I'll see you in the morning.

902
00:48:12,993 --> 00:48:14,167
Make yourself at home.

903
00:48:14,201 --> 00:48:15,375
- All right.

904
00:48:15,409 --> 00:48:17,342
Good night.

905
00:48:17,377 --> 00:48:18,412
- Good night.

906
00:48:27,387 --> 00:48:30,355
- [groans] Is she okay?

907
00:48:30,390 --> 00:48:32,426
- Yeah, she'll be fine.

908
00:48:45,094 --> 00:48:49,443
I guess there's never any
guarantees when you get married.

909
00:48:51,273 --> 00:48:54,069
They used to be
so happy together.

910
00:48:59,453 --> 00:49:02,077
- Are you having
second thoughts?

911
00:49:02,111 --> 00:49:02,940
- No.

912
00:49:07,530 --> 00:49:08,773
I don't know.

913
00:49:11,086 --> 00:49:14,054
I mean, how well do we
really know each other?

914
00:49:14,089 --> 00:49:15,435
He hit her.

915
00:49:15,469 --> 00:49:17,437
- Baby, I love you.

916
00:49:20,785 --> 00:49:24,375
And I would never put
my hands on a woman.

917
00:49:24,409 --> 00:49:27,757
Especially not one
as sweet as you.

918
00:49:27,792 --> 00:49:31,209
You're beautiful,
loving, kind-hearted,

919
00:49:35,627 --> 00:49:37,871
and you can cook your butt off.

920
00:49:37,905 --> 00:49:40,736
[Lauren giggles]

921
00:49:40,770 --> 00:49:44,084
I would never do
anything to hurt you.

922
00:49:51,298 --> 00:49:52,437
- I love you.

923
00:49:52,472 --> 00:49:54,129
- I love you back.

924
00:50:01,446 --> 00:50:04,415
[Lauren sighs]

925
00:50:04,449 --> 00:50:06,486
Okay, I'll have my
secretary fax those over

926
00:50:06,520 --> 00:50:09,006
first thing in the morning.

927
00:50:12,319 --> 00:50:13,493
Okay.

928
00:50:15,150 --> 00:50:16,013
Bye.

929
00:50:18,532 --> 00:50:20,017
What are you doing?

930
00:50:20,051 --> 00:50:24,021
- I feel like you've
been avoiding me lately.

931
00:50:26,195 --> 00:50:28,301
- I've just been busy.

932
00:50:28,335 --> 00:50:32,305
- What, you don't
like me anymore?

933
00:50:32,339 --> 00:50:35,273
I know I'm not
the only one who--

934
00:50:36,481 --> 00:50:40,209
- Look, what we've been
doing is a mistake.

935
00:50:43,523 --> 00:50:45,697
- There are no mistakes.

936
00:50:47,389 --> 00:50:50,737
Besides, we haven't
done anything yet.

937
00:51:00,471 --> 00:51:02,024
- Look, I admit.

938
00:51:02,887 --> 00:51:05,545
There is some attraction here.

939
00:51:12,379 --> 00:51:15,175
But I'm in love with my fiance.

940
00:51:19,524 --> 00:51:21,492
- You're, you're right.

941
00:51:21,526 --> 00:51:23,735
I was wrong to pursue it.

942
00:51:24,426 --> 00:51:25,220
I'm sorry.

943
00:51:27,256 --> 00:51:28,085
- No, wait.

944
00:51:30,225 --> 00:51:31,847
I was wrong.

945
00:51:31,881 --> 00:51:33,055
- Knock, knock, knock, knock.

946
00:51:33,090 --> 00:51:36,955
Ooh, I'm sorry, did I
interrupt something?

947
00:51:38,095 --> 00:51:41,201
- Spencer, what you
still doin' here?

948
00:51:41,236 --> 00:51:44,204
- I'm gonna talk to you later.

949
00:51:44,239 --> 00:51:46,172
- I was workin' late.

950
00:51:48,933 --> 00:51:50,728
Man, what are you
doin' with that woman?

951
00:51:50,762 --> 00:51:52,419
Look, I told you to stay away.

952
00:51:52,454 --> 00:51:55,077
- I know, she just came in here.

953
00:51:55,112 --> 00:51:58,322
The woman's tryin'
to eat me alive.

954
00:51:58,356 --> 00:52:00,600
Spencer, you gotta help me.

955
00:52:01,359 --> 00:52:02,878
- You need Jesus.

956
00:52:04,362 --> 00:52:06,364
- I go to church.

957
00:52:06,399 --> 00:52:08,228
- But do you listen?

958
00:52:08,953 --> 00:52:11,093
Like when the minister's sayin',

959
00:52:11,128 --> 00:52:14,614
do not commit sins
against the flesh.

960
00:52:14,648 --> 00:52:19,136
I am a man who's about
to marry this woman.

961
00:52:19,170 --> 00:52:21,068
- You ain't helpin' me.

962
00:52:24,141 --> 00:52:25,694
- Today, that we
have to be careful

963
00:52:25,728 --> 00:52:28,352
how we abuse our relationships.

964
00:52:28,386 --> 00:52:29,870
God is saying we
have to be careful

965
00:52:29,905 --> 00:52:31,941
how we take our young
ladies for granted,

966
00:52:31,976 --> 00:52:35,152
we have to be careful
of how we perceive them,

967
00:52:35,186 --> 00:52:37,775
we have to be careful
how we deal with them

968
00:52:37,809 --> 00:52:41,537
because God is sayin'
that when you find a wife,

969
00:52:41,572 --> 00:52:43,263
you're not just
findin' somebody.

970
00:52:43,298 --> 00:52:44,230
When you find a wife,

971
00:52:44,264 --> 00:52:46,784
you not just findin'
something off the shelf,

972
00:52:46,818 --> 00:52:49,269
but when you find a
wife, God is sayin'

973
00:52:49,304 --> 00:52:51,547
you have found a good thing.

974
00:52:51,582 --> 00:52:53,170
God is trying to
get us to see, men,

975
00:52:53,204 --> 00:52:55,793
that when we find a
wife, God is saying

976
00:52:55,827 --> 00:52:57,933
he's ready to open up
the windows of heaven

977
00:52:57,967 --> 00:52:59,279
and began to pour
out a blessin'.

978
00:52:59,314 --> 00:53:02,179
And God is sayin' that blessing
comes in many fashions.

979
00:53:02,213 --> 00:53:04,733
He said this blessing
comes as a treasure.

980
00:53:04,767 --> 00:53:07,149
A treasure to you that's
better than diamonds,

981
00:53:07,184 --> 00:53:10,497
a treasure that's greater and
can shine sharper than gold,

982
00:53:10,532 --> 00:53:14,294
a treasure that can be
favorable unto the world

983
00:53:14,329 --> 00:53:15,640
to ever ending.

984
00:53:15,675 --> 00:53:17,159
And so we find that God
is trying to get us to see

985
00:53:17,194 --> 00:53:21,232
that when you find a wife,
you have found something.

986
00:53:21,267 --> 00:53:23,614
When you found a wife
that you have saw

987
00:53:23,648 --> 00:53:25,167
and caught God's attention.

988
00:53:25,202 --> 00:53:27,480
When you find a wife, God
is tryin' to get us to see

989
00:53:27,514 --> 00:53:29,585
that that's all you really need.

990
00:53:29,620 --> 00:53:31,208
God is tryin' to get us to see

991
00:53:31,242 --> 00:53:33,210
that when we find a wife,

992
00:53:33,244 --> 00:53:36,661
he said you not only
found favor with God,

993
00:53:36,696 --> 00:53:38,180
but when you find
favor with God,

994
00:53:38,215 --> 00:53:41,287
God is sayin' I'm going to give
you favor that have riches.

995
00:53:41,321 --> 00:53:43,012
I'm not talkin' about
riches of this world,

996
00:53:43,047 --> 00:53:44,359
but riches that's going to last.

997
00:53:44,393 --> 00:53:46,844
I'm talkin' about favor that
somebody's gonna love you

998
00:53:46,878 --> 00:53:50,123
despite of, favor that God is
going to keep havin' this wife

999
00:53:50,157 --> 00:53:52,229
give you hope, favor that this
wife is going to protect you

1000
00:53:52,263 --> 00:53:55,059
when nobody else is
gonna protect you.

1001
00:53:55,093 --> 00:53:58,683
Favor that will last when
nothin' else will last.

1002
00:53:58,718 --> 00:54:00,167
God is tryin' to get us to see

1003
00:54:00,202 --> 00:54:02,860
that there's a great treasure
when you find a wife,

1004
00:54:02,894 --> 00:54:06,346
a wife that is beauty,
a wife that is awesome,

1005
00:54:06,381 --> 00:54:07,485
a wife that is ever-lasting,

1006
00:54:07,520 --> 00:54:10,350
a wife that is going to keep
you and stick by your side

1007
00:54:10,385 --> 00:54:12,352
when nobody else will
stick by your side.

1008
00:54:12,387 --> 00:54:15,217
I'm talkin' about even when
your friends turn your back,

1009
00:54:15,252 --> 00:54:16,287
you got a wife to go to.

1010
00:54:16,322 --> 00:54:18,841
Even when folk lie on you,
you got a wife to go to.

1011
00:54:18,876 --> 00:54:20,187
Even when folks stab
you in the back,

1012
00:54:20,222 --> 00:54:23,190
God is sayin' this wife
that I've given you

1013
00:54:23,225 --> 00:54:24,502
has many treasures,

1014
00:54:24,537 --> 00:54:26,918
a treasure to love
you unconditionally
when you mess up.

1015
00:54:26,953 --> 00:54:28,644
God says she still
gonna love you.

1016
00:54:28,679 --> 00:54:30,059
Even when you don't do right,

1017
00:54:30,094 --> 00:54:31,268
God says she's gonna
stick by your side,

1018
00:54:31,302 --> 00:54:33,684
even when you don't act
right, God is sayin'

1019
00:54:33,718 --> 00:54:35,720
that wife will
show favor upon you

1020
00:54:35,755 --> 00:54:37,066
that's goin' to stick with you,

1021
00:54:37,101 --> 00:54:39,379
when nobody else
will stick with you.

1022
00:54:39,414 --> 00:54:40,242
The man that finds a wife.

1023
00:54:40,277 --> 00:54:43,176
God is sayin' has
found somethin'.

1024
00:54:43,210 --> 00:54:44,729
Not just any old
thing, but something.

1025
00:54:44,764 --> 00:54:47,076
God is sayin' a good thing.

1026
00:54:47,111 --> 00:54:49,941
And we've got to understand
that when God has blessed us

1027
00:54:49,976 --> 00:54:52,012
despite of our short comings

1028
00:54:52,047 --> 00:54:54,187
despite of all the
things we used to do,

1029
00:54:54,221 --> 00:54:56,879
God is sayin' I still
showing favor upon you

1030
00:54:56,914 --> 00:54:58,709
by His grace and by his mercy,

1031
00:54:58,743 --> 00:55:00,124
and I'm willin' to
give you a good thing.

1032
00:55:00,158 --> 00:55:02,540
Now, this good thing is
just not going to open up

1033
00:55:02,575 --> 00:55:04,439
in the beginning,
but God is sayin'

1034
00:55:04,473 --> 00:55:05,854
you got to love this thing back,

1035
00:55:05,888 --> 00:55:07,407
you got to shake this thing up.

1036
00:55:07,442 --> 00:55:09,271
You gotta work with it to get it

1037
00:55:09,306 --> 00:55:10,514
to what God really
called for it to do.

1038
00:55:10,548 --> 00:55:12,792
God is saying, when he bring
man and woman together,

1039
00:55:12,826 --> 00:55:14,069
we become one.

1040
00:55:14,103 --> 00:55:15,450
That means when I
hurt, she hurts.

1041
00:55:15,484 --> 00:55:16,727
When she hurts, I hurt.

1042
00:55:16,761 --> 00:55:18,936
And God is sayin' when
we love, and I love,

1043
00:55:18,970 --> 00:55:20,213
she's gonna love.

1044
00:55:20,247 --> 00:55:21,594
When I began to forgive,
she's going to forgive.

1045
00:55:21,628 --> 00:55:24,044
And when I began to
show unconditional love,

1046
00:55:24,079 --> 00:55:27,289
she's going to show that back
in return and vice-a versa.

1047
00:55:27,324 --> 00:55:29,118
God is saying, this
is the kind of favor

1048
00:55:29,153 --> 00:55:31,638
that comes from the
Lord because we know

1049
00:55:31,673 --> 00:55:33,295
that God so loved the world,

1050
00:55:33,330 --> 00:55:34,986
that he gave His
only begotten son

1051
00:55:35,021 --> 00:55:38,404
and God is sayin', we got to
have this same old agape love

1052
00:55:38,438 --> 00:55:39,957
for when we find a wife.

1053
00:55:39,991 --> 00:55:41,303
So we just don't find a wife,

1054
00:55:41,338 --> 00:55:44,237
but God has shown favor to
design and to lead a wife to us.

1055
00:55:44,271 --> 00:55:46,101
We may have met her
at a football game,

1056
00:55:46,135 --> 00:55:47,309
we may have met her at the club,

1057
00:55:47,344 --> 00:55:49,138
we may have met
her on the street,

1058
00:55:49,173 --> 00:55:50,795
but God is sayin'
when you find her,

1059
00:55:50,830 --> 00:55:53,073
you've found a good thing.

1060
00:55:53,108 --> 00:55:54,316
- [Congregation] Amen.

1061
00:55:54,351 --> 00:55:57,837
[congregation applauds]

1062
00:55:58,941 --> 00:56:00,633
- Thank you.

1063
00:56:00,667 --> 00:56:02,842
- [Pastor] God bless you.

1064
00:56:02,876 --> 00:56:04,602
- Oh, that was a really
good sermon today, Pastor.

1065
00:56:04,637 --> 00:56:05,500
- Thank you so much.

1066
00:56:05,534 --> 00:56:06,466
- I'll see you tomorrow.

1067
00:56:06,501 --> 00:56:07,329
- I'll look for you tomorrow

1068
00:56:07,364 --> 00:56:08,330
- Okay.

1069
00:56:08,365 --> 00:56:10,056
- [Pastor] God bless.

1070
