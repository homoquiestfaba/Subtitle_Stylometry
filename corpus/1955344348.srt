00:01:08,969 --> 00:01:11,017
(FOOTSTEPS)

2
00:01:19,771 --> 00:01:22,650
- Time to get up, Dad.
- Hmm?

3
00:01:30,115 --> 00:01:31,708
You sleep all right?

4
00:01:39,708 --> 00:01:41,460
People like milky coffee.

5
00:01:43,503 --> 00:01:45,847
Why not put a little grease
in your coffee?

6
00:01:49,009 --> 00:01:50,727
No, Dad.

7
00:01:50,844 --> 00:01:52,517
It sounds gross.

8
00:01:53,472 --> 00:01:56,476
Why not put a little grease in your java?

9
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:57,897
Why not try it?

10
00:01:59,895 --> 00:02:02,114
You're such a gross-out, Dad.

11
00:02:02,230 --> 00:02:04,403
I think I might barf.

12
00:02:04,524 --> 00:02:07,243
I'm not saying I wanna do it.

13
00:02:08,278 --> 00:02:12,203
I just wonder why
they haven't tried greasy coffee.

14
00:02:14,326 --> 00:02:15,748
Greasy coffee?

15
00:02:18,872 --> 00:02:21,500
Hey, you probably think
I'm the Greasy Strangler.

16
00:02:23,794 --> 00:02:25,216
I never said that.

17
00:02:27,672 --> 00:02:29,219
Tell you a secret.

18
00:02:30,133 --> 00:02:32,932
I am the Greasy Strangler.

19
00:02:35,931 --> 00:02:37,933
Hey, I call bullshit on that.

20
00:02:40,852 --> 00:02:42,274
OK.

21
00:02:43,063 --> 00:02:45,737
I'm not the Greasy Strangler.

22
00:02:47,317 --> 00:02:49,445
But you're a bullshit artist.

23
00:02:51,822 --> 00:02:53,699
Yeah, I kind of am.

24
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:39,627
Now, who likes the Bee Gees?

25
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:45,210
Well, this is where they came up
with that fabulous, spunky song,

26
00:03:45,333 --> 00:03:46,710
"Night Fever".

27
00:03:48,128 --> 00:03:50,051
What do you mean, "came up with"?

28
00:03:50,797 --> 00:03:54,017
They wrote the lyrics while
they were standing in this doorway.

29
00:03:55,093 --> 00:03:57,846
Why were they standing in this doorway?

30
00:03:57,971 --> 00:04:00,190
They were waiting
for a friend to pick them up.

31
00:04:00,307 --> 00:04:03,777
They were going out for Chinese
and celebrating his birthday.

32
00:04:04,603 --> 00:04:06,276
Can you verify that, please?

33
00:04:06,396 --> 00:04:08,694
Trust me, I know disco.

34
00:04:10,191 --> 00:04:13,411
I thought free drinks
were included in this tour.

35
00:04:13,528 --> 00:04:18,409
No, there's no free drinks.
I don't know where you got that idea.

36
00:04:18,950 --> 00:04:23,706
- It said in the brochure.
- The information you got is bullshit!

37
00:04:24,623 --> 00:04:28,503
We don't need even fizzy drinks.
Just water would be enough.

38
00:04:28,627 --> 00:04:31,597
You got false information.

39
00:04:32,422 --> 00:04:34,095
We must have free drinks.

40
00:04:34,215 --> 00:04:36,934
No free drinks!

41
00:04:37,052 --> 00:04:39,475
- Free drinks now!
- No free drinks!

42
00:04:39,596 --> 00:04:41,098
Come on, we want free drinks.

43
00:04:41,848 --> 00:04:44,692
- Free drinks.
- We must have free drinks.

44
00:04:44,809 --> 00:04:47,528
No free drinks!

45
00:04:47,646 --> 00:04:49,523
Free drinks! Free drinks!

46
00:04:49,648 --> 00:04:53,243
Free drinks! Free drinks! Free drinks!

47
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:55,704
Free drinks! Free drinks! Free drinks!

48
00:04:55,820 --> 00:04:57,914
Free drinks! Free drinks! Free drinks!

49
00:04:58,031 --> 00:05:00,750
No free drinks!

50
00:05:00,867 --> 00:05:02,835
Frei drinken.

51
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:06,294
Nichts frei drink.

52
00:05:07,082 --> 00:05:09,084
You must give me free drinks immediately.

53
00:05:09,209 --> 00:05:10,927
Drop it with the free drinks crap.

54
00:05:11,044 --> 00:05:13,342
We believe in the power of free drinks.

55
00:05:13,463 --> 00:05:15,090
There are no free drinks,

56
00:05:15,215 --> 00:05:17,468
and if you're trying
to rip me a new asshole,

57
00:05:17,592 --> 00:05:20,141
you're making a big mistake.

58
00:05:20,595 --> 00:05:22,939
You are a shitty businessman.
You know that, no?

59
00:05:23,056 --> 00:05:25,400
And you're a bunch of fucking cunts.

60
00:05:25,517 --> 00:05:27,064
Check my cheeks.

61
00:05:51,001 --> 00:05:52,548
I'm sorry.

62
00:05:52,669 --> 00:05:55,047
My dad can get cranky sometimes.

63
00:05:55,171 --> 00:05:57,549
He sure has a temper on him.

64
00:05:57,674 --> 00:05:59,176
Yeah.

65
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:02,224
He likes to shout. I like to smile.

66
00:06:03,513 --> 00:06:05,857
You cheesy old cornball.

67
00:06:05,974 --> 00:06:08,773
Yeah, that's what I am.

68
00:06:08,893 --> 00:06:10,816
I'm a cheesy old cornball.

69
00:06:10,937 --> 00:06:12,780
(CHUCKLES)

70
00:06:13,356 --> 00:06:14,653
Yeah, you are.

71
00:06:15,442 --> 00:06:17,160
But that's OK.

72
00:06:17,277 --> 00:06:18,950
I kind of like it.

73
00:06:19,571 --> 00:06:21,323
My name's Brayden.

74
00:06:23,074 --> 00:06:25,122
(SCOTTISH ACCENT) Brayden?

75
00:06:25,243 --> 00:06:26,916
Is that Scottish?

76
00:06:27,579 --> 00:06:30,253
It's not Scottish. What's your name?

77
00:06:31,416 --> 00:06:32,713
I'm Janet.

78
00:06:34,919 --> 00:06:38,674
Hey, stop talking to the customer
and help Dad with his shorts.

79
00:06:55,356 --> 00:06:59,987
So, Dad, I think I've got a date
with that hot girl from the tour.

80
00:07:00,111 --> 00:07:03,741
No way! You're a bullshit artist.

81
00:07:03,865 --> 00:07:06,243
No, it's official.

82
00:07:06,367 --> 00:07:08,836
It's all been confirmed. She likes me.

83
00:07:08,953 --> 00:07:12,378
- She's yanking your chain. Trust me.
- No, Dad.

84
00:07:12,499 --> 00:07:15,878
She likes my character. She said so.

85
00:07:16,002 --> 00:07:17,845
And her name's Janet.

86
00:07:26,679 --> 00:07:28,522
That's not right.

87
00:07:29,682 --> 00:07:35,189
I need them greasy
and this is nothing like greasy.

88
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:38,032
Do you understand?

89
00:07:39,275 --> 00:07:41,528
Too much grease is bad for you.

90
00:07:41,653 --> 00:07:44,532
I read it in a fitness magazine
someone left on the bus.

91
00:07:44,656 --> 00:07:47,250
That's horse shit.
You're a bullshit artist.

92
00:07:48,368 --> 00:07:49,995
We have an agreement.

93
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:52,919
You stay here, you cook greasy.

94
00:07:53,581 --> 00:07:55,629
And this is not it.

95
00:07:56,376 --> 00:07:59,505
Maybe you should just go live
with your mum and Ricky Prickles.

96
00:08:00,672 --> 00:08:02,640
Dad, don't keep saying that.

97
00:08:02,757 --> 00:08:04,634
You know Ricky Prickles hates me.

98
00:08:06,219 --> 00:08:09,223
Last time I was there,
he called me Fatty Boom Boom.

99
00:08:09,347 --> 00:08:10,815
(SCOFFS)

100
00:08:10,932 --> 00:08:13,230
First, there's this dry food.

101
00:08:14,394 --> 00:08:16,442
Now you're telling me
you got a girlfriend.

102
00:08:17,689 --> 00:08:20,408
Next you're gonna be
leaving the family business.

103
00:08:20,525 --> 00:08:22,493
You must not like me very much.

104
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:27,783
Is that what this is all about?

105
00:08:27,907 --> 00:08:29,705
I'm sorry, Dad.

106
00:08:29,826 --> 00:08:31,828
I can add more oil if you want.

107
00:08:31,953 --> 00:08:34,001
I'm not hungry anymore.

108
00:08:35,081 --> 00:08:37,834
Dad, I don't wanna leave you.

109
00:08:39,419 --> 00:08:41,421
But I guess I do like Janet.

110
00:08:42,422 --> 00:08:46,427
She might not like me, though,
not when she gets to know me.

111
00:08:47,510 --> 00:08:49,979
If she gets to know you.

112
00:09:12,118 --> 00:09:14,541
You ask it for chips and you get nothing.

113
00:09:14,662 --> 00:09:17,165
Yes, you should tell management.

114
00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:20,635
I pay a dollar for the chips,
the chips get stuck,

115
00:09:20,752 --> 00:09:23,631
the manager gets my dollar,
and I get no chips.

116
00:09:23,755 --> 00:09:24,802
Please tell me,

117
00:09:24,923 --> 00:09:27,927
what flavour chips
did you eventually decide upon?

118
00:09:28,051 --> 00:09:29,428
Who cares?

119
00:09:29,552 --> 00:09:31,680
They were paprika ridge chips.

120
00:09:32,513 --> 00:09:33,935
I like the ridges.

121
00:09:34,057 --> 00:09:36,685
I put the tip of my tongue between ridges,

122
00:09:36,809 --> 00:09:40,530
because that is where
the salty chip dust is.

123
00:09:40,647 --> 00:09:43,491
Yes, that's so true.

124
00:09:43,608 --> 00:09:45,281
I love ridges.

125
00:09:45,735 --> 00:09:48,739
Yes, but what are these chips made from?

126
00:09:48,863 --> 00:09:51,116
(RAPID, THICK ACCENT) Potato.

127
00:09:52,742 --> 00:09:54,710
Excuse me, what?

128
00:09:55,495 --> 00:09:57,042
Potato.

129
00:09:57,163 --> 00:10:00,167
- Can you say that again?
- Potato.

130
00:10:02,085 --> 00:10:05,589
Yes, but what are these chips made from?

131
00:10:06,547 --> 00:10:07,673
Potato.

132
00:10:07,799 --> 00:10:09,767
- Sorry, but what?
- Potato.

133
00:10:10,343 --> 00:10:13,313
I don't understand.
Can you say that again?

134
00:10:13,429 --> 00:10:16,148
- Potato.
- Please, one more time.

135
00:10:16,266 --> 00:10:17,734
Potato.

136
00:10:18,768 --> 00:10:20,862
OK, this is embarrassing,

137
00:10:20,979 --> 00:10:23,858
but, please, can you say it
a little slower?

138
00:10:26,067 --> 00:10:27,444
Potato.

139
00:10:29,612 --> 00:10:32,707
I am very, very sorry,

140
00:10:32,824 --> 00:10:35,168
but I need to know,

141
00:10:35,285 --> 00:10:38,129
what are these chips made from?

142
00:10:38,871 --> 00:10:40,293
Potato.

143
00:10:41,749 --> 00:10:43,376
- Please, one last time.
- Potato.

144
00:10:43,501 --> 00:10:46,175
I think he's trying to say potato.

145
00:10:48,006 --> 00:10:49,849
Ah, yes.

146
00:10:49,966 --> 00:10:51,639
Potato!

147
00:10:51,759 --> 00:10:53,761
Potato chips.

148
00:11:27,879 --> 00:11:30,302
What on earth is this man doing?

149
00:11:31,257 --> 00:11:34,306
Hey, there are three of us
and one of you, buddy.

150
00:11:34,427 --> 00:11:36,179
Maybe he's not a man.

151
00:11:37,013 --> 00:11:39,732
Maybe he's the boogie-woogie.

152
00:11:39,849 --> 00:11:41,567
Is he the boogie-woogie?

153
00:11:49,984 --> 00:11:51,201
My God!

154
00:11:51,319 --> 00:11:53,617
This man is truly mad.

155
00:11:53,738 --> 00:11:57,493
Who cares? On the count of three,
we'll tackle him.

156
00:11:57,617 --> 00:11:59,711
One, two, three.

157
00:12:03,039 --> 00:12:05,167
(GROWLING)

158
00:12:09,670 --> 00:12:11,672
I am a rich gentlemen.

159
00:12:11,798 --> 00:12:14,142
I own a premium shipping business
in Denver.

160
00:12:14,258 --> 00:12:19,606
Let me live.
I will make you the chief shareholder.

161
00:12:19,722 --> 00:12:23,602
You will get a handsome salary
with the attractive corner office.

162
00:12:23,726 --> 00:12:25,899
Does that or does that not appeal to you?

163
00:12:27,939 --> 00:12:31,284
I wanted some ridged paprika chips.

164
00:12:31,401 --> 00:12:33,199
They weren't even for me.

165
00:12:33,778 --> 00:12:36,247
Who cares? There is a girl in my room.

166
00:12:37,365 --> 00:12:40,244
I met her tonight at a sports bar.

167
00:12:42,203 --> 00:12:45,298
We tried to have sex
but I couldn't get a stiffy.

168
00:12:46,082 --> 00:12:49,131
Then my balls got sucked up
into my abdomen.

169
00:12:51,963 --> 00:12:54,682
Does it strike you as unusual?

170
00:12:57,510 --> 00:12:59,979
Am I dead yet?

171
00:13:00,096 --> 00:13:02,724
My name is Sidney.

172
00:13:17,196 --> 00:13:19,039
(SCREAMING)

173
00:13:25,079 --> 00:13:26,080
Ronnie?

174
00:13:26,205 --> 00:13:27,878
Is that you, Big Ronnie?

175
00:13:27,999 --> 00:13:29,967
Oh, yeah, better believe it.

176
00:13:30,084 --> 00:13:31,506
I heard screaming.

177
00:13:31,627 --> 00:13:33,971
All OK back there, Big Ronnie?

178
00:13:34,088 --> 00:13:36,591
Yeah, sure. I was laughing.

179
00:13:36,716 --> 00:13:40,186
Oh, laughing, were you?
Why, did your car get too greasy again?

180
00:13:40,303 --> 00:13:43,147
No comment, but yeah, kind of did.

181
00:13:44,432 --> 00:13:46,480
I like going through the car wash.

182
00:13:46,601 --> 00:13:49,195
It's good to know
my car is getting a good clean.

183
00:13:49,312 --> 00:13:50,939
It's fun.

184
00:13:51,063 --> 00:13:54,033
Oh, and here's ten for the wash.

185
00:13:54,859 --> 00:13:57,908
And I'm gonna go use your bathroom.

186
00:13:58,029 --> 00:13:59,827
Oh, you go right ahead, Big Ronnie.

187
00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:54,718
Ronnie's back.

188
00:14:54,835 --> 00:14:58,556
Let's go disco dancing
again soon, Big Ronnie.

189
00:14:59,632 --> 00:15:04,103
Yeah, that's not a bad idea.
We could disco dance. Why not?

190
00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:07,144
We used to disco dance all the time.

191
00:15:07,265 --> 00:15:09,643
I guess you got too busy lately.

192
00:15:09,767 --> 00:15:12,941
Ah, well, it's a little embarrassing,

193
00:15:13,062 --> 00:15:15,315
but my son's having problems.

194
00:15:15,439 --> 00:15:17,066
What kind of problems, Big Ronnie?

195
00:15:17,191 --> 00:15:18,613
Between you and me,

196
00:15:18,734 --> 00:15:21,408
I think my son's
a severe manic depressive.

197
00:15:21,529 --> 00:15:23,531
He should be on medication.

198
00:15:23,656 --> 00:15:26,455
And did I tell you
he still craps the bed most nights?

199
00:15:27,618 --> 00:15:28,995
Oh, boy.

200
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:30,212
Uh-oh.

201
00:15:30,329 --> 00:15:31,751
No, you did not.

202
00:15:31,872 --> 00:15:34,921
Yeah, and he craps on the carpet.

203
00:15:35,042 --> 00:15:37,215
I've found it in the kitchen.

204
00:15:37,336 --> 00:15:40,556
Hell, he even crapped
on top of the TV last week.

205
00:15:41,173 --> 00:15:43,892
Anyway, thanks for the scrub.

206
00:15:44,010 --> 00:15:46,809
OK, Big Ronnie.
Catch you again soon, I hope.

207
00:15:48,055 --> 00:15:49,682
Bye-bye, Big Paul.

208
00:15:49,807 --> 00:15:51,650
Bye-bye, Big Ronnie.

209
00:15:51,767 --> 00:15:53,189
(LAUGHING)

210
00:16:08,951 --> 00:16:10,749
Morning, Dad.

211
00:16:10,870 --> 00:16:12,372
Go away.

212
00:16:13,122 --> 00:16:15,216
Someone's a grouch today.

213
00:16:16,208 --> 00:16:18,131
Oh, you don't care.

214
00:16:20,087 --> 00:16:21,555
What does that mean?

215
00:16:26,761 --> 00:16:29,059
Oh, now that you got a girlfriend,

216
00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:31,148
you're probably gonna wanna move out.

217
00:16:31,599 --> 00:16:33,067
Bullshit artist.

218
00:16:33,184 --> 00:16:35,278
We haven't even had our first date.

219
00:16:35,394 --> 00:16:37,613
Look, I know women.

220
00:16:37,730 --> 00:16:40,108
She'll want you all to herself.

221
00:16:40,232 --> 00:16:41,529
She looked greedy.

222
00:16:42,318 --> 00:16:44,320
She looked nice to me.

223
00:16:45,696 --> 00:16:48,370
You'll leave and I'll die of loneliness.

224
00:16:49,992 --> 00:16:51,289
People do that, you know.

225
00:16:52,036 --> 00:16:56,041
They get so lonely,
their heart stops and they die.

226
00:16:56,832 --> 00:16:58,584
But you won't care.

227
00:16:58,709 --> 00:17:02,555
You'll be too busy making love.

228
00:17:02,672 --> 00:17:04,094
(SOBBING)

229
00:17:08,177 --> 00:17:10,054
Cut it out, Dad.

230
00:17:10,179 --> 00:17:12,307
Quit goofing off.

231
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:15,313
(BOTH LAUGH)

232
00:17:19,897 --> 00:17:21,991
I'm not going anywhere, Dad.

233
00:17:22,108 --> 00:17:24,076
You know how I am with the ladies.

234
00:17:24,610 --> 00:17:27,409
But seriously, I have something
I need to tell you.

235
00:17:27,530 --> 00:17:29,624
- Come here.
- Go for it, Dad.

236
00:17:29,740 --> 00:17:31,959
- Are you ready?
- Yes. What is it?

237
00:17:33,953 --> 00:17:34,954
(FARTS)

238
00:17:42,086 --> 00:17:45,135
I'm making these bacon rolls
real greasy, Dad.

239
00:17:45,631 --> 00:17:47,008
Bullshit artist.

240
00:17:47,133 --> 00:17:48,555
Am not.

241
00:17:48,676 --> 00:17:49,768
Bullshit.

242
00:17:49,885 --> 00:17:51,512
You make this the greasiest feast

243
00:17:51,637 --> 00:17:53,639
since that goose you cooked on Christmas.

244
00:17:57,768 --> 00:18:00,317
Done and done, Dad.

245
00:18:21,876 --> 00:18:26,256
And now, this very store here

246
00:18:26,380 --> 00:18:29,850
is where Kool
from "Kool and the Gang" worked

247
00:18:29,967 --> 00:18:33,642
before he exploded onto the disco scene.

248
00:18:37,099 --> 00:18:40,729
Anyway, this is the end
of Big Ronnie's Disco Tour.

249
00:18:40,853 --> 00:18:44,653
Thank you very much for coming
and, er, come again soon.

250
00:18:59,705 --> 00:19:02,834
So, where are you taking me
tonight, Mister?

251
00:19:03,959 --> 00:19:06,087
How about a sizzling Cajun hotpot?

252
00:19:06,212 --> 00:19:08,840
What about me? Who's gonna cook for me?

253
00:19:08,964 --> 00:19:12,093
- I'm hungry.
- You'll have to go to a vendor, Dad.

254
00:19:12,218 --> 00:19:15,017
- You'll have to go get a dog.
- Not a real dog.

255
00:19:15,137 --> 00:19:17,185
Yeah, don't bite into a real dog.

256
00:19:17,306 --> 00:19:19,308
Don't bite into a... woof-woof.

257
00:19:19,433 --> 00:19:20,650
Woof!

258
00:19:22,269 --> 00:19:25,489
OK, you two can fuck off tonight.

259
00:19:25,606 --> 00:19:26,607
Bye, Dad.

260
00:19:26,732 --> 00:19:28,109
Bye-bye.

261
00:19:28,234 --> 00:19:30,157
Bye-bye!

262
00:19:30,277 --> 00:19:31,745
Fucking cunts!

263
00:19:40,037 --> 00:19:44,759
I could feast on that queen's ass
all night long.

264
00:19:59,598 --> 00:20:02,647
Thanks, Big Heiny.
Looking forward to a great meal.

265
00:20:02,768 --> 00:20:04,315
Of course, of course.

266
00:20:12,111 --> 00:20:16,867
I think I read once that these kinds
of breadstick are called grissini.

267
00:20:22,121 --> 00:20:23,122
Probably.

268
00:20:27,418 --> 00:20:30,388
So, um, does your mum live with you too?

269
00:20:31,755 --> 00:20:33,382
No.

270
00:20:33,507 --> 00:20:35,384
She left when I was small.

271
00:20:36,343 --> 00:20:37,936
She met someone new.

272
00:20:39,013 --> 00:20:40,356
Well, that's crapola.

273
00:20:42,016 --> 00:20:43,359
Yeah.

274
00:20:43,475 --> 00:20:45,148
His name is Ricky Prickles.

275
00:20:46,353 --> 00:20:48,526
He's a professional sports coach.

276
00:20:48,647 --> 00:20:51,696
He's got the most defined six-pack
I've ever seen.

277
00:20:51,817 --> 00:20:54,366
Ooh. Tell this girl more.

278
00:20:56,572 --> 00:20:59,166
I went to stay with Mum and Ricky once.

279
00:20:59,283 --> 00:21:01,411
He made me punch him in his six-pack.

280
00:21:03,287 --> 00:21:06,541
He didn't feel anything
because the muscles were so hard.

281
00:21:07,666 --> 00:21:11,671
It was like punching a vacuum-packed
bag of roasted sausages.

282
00:21:13,255 --> 00:21:15,804
Then he made me do
abdominal crunches with him.

283
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:20,138
I barfed all over his carpet.

284
00:21:20,262 --> 00:21:23,061
My barf was real orange and tasted fizzy.

285
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:28,024
Ricky Prickles was so mad,

286
00:21:28,145 --> 00:21:31,069
he smacked me twice in the face
with the flat of his hand.

287
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:35,448
Ricky the Pricky.

288
00:21:35,569 --> 00:21:37,287
Then he molested me.

289
00:21:38,906 --> 00:21:40,328
Sexually harassed me.

290
00:21:42,952 --> 00:21:44,499
How old were you?

291
00:21:44,620 --> 00:21:46,088
Eighteen.

292
00:21:47,122 --> 00:21:49,921
I had long golden hair
and a soft moustache.

293
00:21:51,251 --> 00:21:54,676
I've never been able to do
muscle curls or abdominal crunches.

294
00:21:57,549 --> 00:21:59,927
Not all girls like ripped-up abs.

295
00:22:01,095 --> 00:22:02,768
Yeah.

296
00:22:02,888 --> 00:22:05,061
Some girls like loyal hearts.

297
00:22:19,196 --> 00:22:21,073
Janet, what's wrong?

298
00:22:24,076 --> 00:22:25,123
Please, Janet.

299
00:22:27,037 --> 00:22:29,631
The tourists I was with the other day
were murdered.

300
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:33,297
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

301
00:22:33,419 --> 00:22:35,046
Hey, hey, hey.

302
00:22:35,170 --> 00:22:37,343
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

303
00:22:43,178 --> 00:22:44,475
You're cute.

304
00:22:49,810 --> 00:22:51,687
If I'm cute,

305
00:22:51,812 --> 00:22:53,735
you're stunningly beautiful.

306
00:23:21,425 --> 00:23:23,519
How can I help you, sir?

307
00:23:23,635 --> 00:23:25,808
I wanna dog. Give me a dog.

308
00:23:25,929 --> 00:23:30,309
One famous dog coming up.
I'll make yours extra picante, yeah?

309
00:23:36,482 --> 00:23:41,784
That'll be uno, dos, tres bucks.

310
00:23:43,030 --> 00:23:44,782
What the fuck is this shit?

311
00:23:45,824 --> 00:23:48,953
This is one famous chilli cheese dog.

312
00:23:49,078 --> 00:23:51,422
No, this isn't right.

313
00:23:51,538 --> 00:23:54,542
I need more grease on this.
I need more oil.

314
00:23:54,666 --> 00:23:56,509
Sir, I cannot do that.

315
00:23:56,627 --> 00:23:59,676
It's against regulations.
I could lose my licence.

316
00:23:59,797 --> 00:24:01,549
I need this oily.

317
00:24:01,673 --> 00:24:04,597
I need this to lubricate the world.

318
00:24:04,718 --> 00:24:09,315
I need this dog to have some grease on it,

319
00:24:09,431 --> 00:24:14,358
so when I eat it
the grease will lubricate my throat.

320
00:24:14,937 --> 00:24:17,360
Sir, I cannot do that.

321
00:24:17,481 --> 00:24:19,529
It's not safe to use too much oil.

322
00:24:19,650 --> 00:24:24,281
I could... I repeat,
I could lose my licence.

323
00:24:25,948 --> 00:24:29,293
You probably think
I'm the Greasy Strangler.

324
00:24:29,409 --> 00:24:32,253
That's why you won't grease my dog.

325
00:24:43,382 --> 00:24:45,384
Hey, what are you doing?

326
00:24:45,509 --> 00:24:48,729
You're not allowed to touch that.
That's dangerous equipment.

327
00:24:48,846 --> 00:24:52,066
You could burn yourself.
I could lose my licence.

328
00:24:52,182 --> 00:24:55,857
I'm gonna dunk Big Ronnie's dog
all the way in.

329
00:25:01,358 --> 00:25:03,281
This dog is fully dunked.

330
00:25:23,797 --> 00:25:26,425
I wanna write fantasy novels someday.

331
00:25:27,843 --> 00:25:31,518
Interactive fables
with full colour illustrations

332
00:25:31,638 --> 00:25:34,312
and fold-out maps of faraway realms.

333
00:25:35,767 --> 00:25:38,816
I'd narrate the tales myself
for the audiobooks.

334
00:25:39,479 --> 00:25:41,948
I'd do all the voices for the characters,

335
00:25:42,065 --> 00:25:44,238
even the dragons and trolls.

336
00:25:45,319 --> 00:25:47,321
What will the book be called?

337
00:25:48,030 --> 00:25:51,034
The first one is going to be called
"The Amulet of Arg".

338
00:25:51,992 --> 00:25:55,417
Arg is the reluctant keeper
of the trolls' realm.

339
00:25:56,413 --> 00:25:59,462
In the second book,
he crosses over to the digital realm

340
00:25:59,583 --> 00:26:01,176
to become the digi-troll.

341
00:26:03,045 --> 00:26:07,516
In the third book, he fulfils his destiny
as the Lord of the Three Realms.

342
00:26:08,383 --> 00:26:10,260
He has the largest amulet.

343
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:16,274
I bet you have
a pretty large amulet yourself.

344
00:26:19,686 --> 00:26:21,529
I don't own an amulet.

345
00:26:24,775 --> 00:26:27,654
You're a real change of pace for me
after guys like Rico.

346
00:26:28,737 --> 00:26:30,489
He was all fingers.

347
00:26:52,844 --> 00:26:54,972
I didn't say you could do that.

348
00:26:59,101 --> 00:27:00,944
Hey, where's my dad?

349
00:28:04,916 --> 00:28:06,714
(SCREAMING)

350
00:28:41,453 --> 00:28:42,454
(BELCHES)

351
00:28:50,545 --> 00:28:52,297
Ronnie? Is that you, Ronnie?

352
00:28:54,508 --> 00:28:55,851
Why, yes it is.

353
00:28:55,967 --> 00:28:57,969
It's me, Ronnie.

354
00:28:58,637 --> 00:29:01,561
You must be driving some oily roads.

355
00:29:01,681 --> 00:29:04,059
You're getting a lot of car washes
these days.

356
00:29:05,018 --> 00:29:06,816
What are you implying, Paul?

357
00:29:06,937 --> 00:29:08,359
Oh, nothing.

358
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:11,780
Just making a pleasantry,
that's all, Ronnie.

359
00:29:11,900 --> 00:29:13,368
Just a pleasantry.

360
00:29:14,236 --> 00:29:15,328
You ever hear those?

361
00:29:15,445 --> 00:29:17,948
Next time keep it to yourself, OK?

All right, Big Brayden.

367
00:30:02,325 --> 00:30:05,295
- Hey, Oinker.
- You ready to hit the Horror House?

368
00:30:05,745 --> 00:30:09,500
Hey, you didn't tell me
you were out tonight.

369
00:30:09,624 --> 00:30:12,093
Two nights in a row is not permitted,

370
00:30:12,210 --> 00:30:14,446
unless I come with you.

371
00:30:14,546 --> 00:30:17,174
Or I could evict you.

372
00:30:17,299 --> 00:30:20,348
Dad, I told you this morning.

373
00:30:20,469 --> 00:30:25,100
- You were too groggy to pay attention.
- Or too stoned on fart fumes.

374
00:30:25,223 --> 00:30:28,568
Brayden told me you trumped
a real humdinger the other day.

375
00:30:28,685 --> 00:30:31,529
He said you cut
the world's biggest cheese.

376
00:30:31,646 --> 00:30:34,365
He said his eyes were watering.

377
00:30:41,239 --> 00:30:44,334
I'm joining you
at the Horror House tonight.

378
00:30:44,451 --> 00:30:46,249
I'm free tonight,

379
00:30:46,369 --> 00:30:49,418
so I'm coming with you
to the Horror House.

380
00:30:49,539 --> 00:30:50,711
But Dad!

381
00:30:52,250 --> 00:30:55,925
If you don't let me come,
I'm going to tell Janet

382
00:30:56,046 --> 00:31:00,768
that you haven't even stuck one finger
up a girl's pussy yet, OK?

383
00:31:03,470 --> 00:31:06,189
Oinker, where did you get those shoes?

384
00:31:08,183 --> 00:31:12,529
I'm renting them,
and I'm absolutely loving it.

Three tickets for the Horror House,
please, Big Thaddeus.

388
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:30,793
Sure thing, Big Brayden.

389
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:36,845
Popcorn. I need a big bucket of popcorn.

390
00:31:40,131 --> 00:31:42,509
No, this isn't right.

391
00:31:42,634 --> 00:31:44,386
I need more grease on this.

- Dad.
- What?

396
00:32:32,767 --> 00:32:34,986
Janet is coming over tonight.

397
00:32:35,103 --> 00:32:36,901
We're making baguettes for dinner.

398
00:32:37,022 --> 00:32:40,071
They're long French bread sticks
filled with melted mozzarella

399
00:32:40,191 --> 00:32:42,660
and lardons, which are ham cubes.

400
00:32:42,777 --> 00:32:45,246
Janet went to France last year.

401
00:32:45,363 --> 00:32:47,411
She fell in love with the food.

402
00:32:47,532 --> 00:32:49,660
Is it OK if she comes tonight, Dad?

403
00:32:51,953 --> 00:32:56,333
OK, disco people, do you remember
the Earth, the Wind and the Fire?

404
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:02,006
Did you know that all three of them
lived in that apartment up there?

405
00:33:18,355 --> 00:33:22,952
I've been making my own olive oil
in my bedroom.

I don't know if I'm doing it right, Janet.

lined up for today?

00:35:15,346 --> 00:35:16,643
Maybe.

No, it's Ronnie, Brayden's dad.

00:36:45,478 --> 00:36:46,479
Oh.

00:36:49,190 --> 00:36:51,943
Yeah. I wanted to watch you go pee.

432
00:36:53,820 --> 00:36:55,697
Peeing is private.

433
00:36:56,990 --> 00:36:58,788
Yeah, usually.

434
00:36:58,908 --> 00:37:00,535
But I got teeth to brush.

435
00:37:08,877 --> 00:37:10,754
Go ahead, keep peeing. I won't look.

00:37:52,587 --> 00:37:55,056
Because my dad said he watched you go pee.

I don't want to see you get hurt, OK?

464
00:40:52,100 --> 00:40:55,445
I should spend some time
getting to know her, alone.

and make her love you.

Yeah? Why did Mum leave, then?

She left because you used to get
into her bed and poop all over her leg.

That's a lie and you know it.

when she was leaving.

00:41:25,133 --> 00:41:28,512
You mean, meeting Ricky Prickles
with his ripped-up abdominal muscles

476
00:41:28,636 --> 00:41:30,479
had nothing to do with her leaving?

477

but you will be,

to fuck you up and leave you lonely.

Is it exclusive? You bet it is.

15 bucks for a luxuriously creamy
pussy-ass daiquiri, motherfuckers.

497
00:42:55,640 --> 00:42:57,608
That's kind of pricey for a drink.

498
00:42:58,392 --> 00:42:59,814
It's not a drink.

499
00:43:00,645 --> 00:43:02,272
It's liquid sex.

- Are too.

00:43:18,287 --> 00:43:20,289
Well, kind of am.

00:44:42,538 --> 00:44:44,506
I used to run a night club.

512

I booked all the disco acts.
I knew them personally.

Michael Jackson to the airport,

514
00:44:51,839 --> 00:44:55,093
and on the way we decided
to stop at this little blues club,

515
00:44:55,217 --> 00:44:58,596
because he wanted to kick back
with a bottle of wine and a cigar.

It was a quiet night.
He was eating these delicious nachos.

00:45:02,808 --> 00:45:04,276
And I broke into the DJ booth

518
00:45:04,393 --> 00:45:06,862
and I put "Smooth Criminal"
on the sound system.

519
00:45:07,605 --> 00:45:09,824
I wanted to boogie and so did Michael.

520
00:45:09,940 --> 00:45:11,863
He got up and started dancing on the table

521
00:45:11,984 --> 00:45:14,737
and this security guard came up
and tried to take him down,

522
00:45:14,862 --> 00:45:16,580
so I punched him the fuck out.

523

and Michael hit him.

He hit him so hard, his hair fell out.

525

And then these two Korean twins
came on to us

526
00:45:25,873 --> 00:45:28,342
so we took them into the manager's office

527

and we started pumping away at them.

528
00:45:30,711 --> 00:45:33,055

just pumping and pumping

529
00:45:33,172 --> 00:45:36,221

with hot, milky cum

and everybody applauded.

531
00:45:39,261 --> 00:45:42,811
Then he gave me one of his gloves
and I drove him to the airport.

532
00:45:42,932 --> 00:45:46,027
He was going to Rome
for some top-secret meeting.

I am Jody,

and if your hunch is correct,

811
01:13:37,605 --> 01:13:39,653
you are the son

from the murder crime scene.

with this case any further

out of my long, juicy prickus.

as your father I forbid you to marry.

864
01:18:54,171 --> 01:18:56,515
And one other thing, you're evicted,

and we're leaving gladly.

about one thing, though, Dad.

he tried to impress me
with a loud fart once.

He put his legs behind his head
and shouted,

"Someone's cutting the cheese."

886
01:19:50,853 --> 01:19:55,950
Instead of just gas, a big glob of turd
flew out of his butt like a rocket.

887

It did a loop-the-loop near the wall
and landed on the bed.

around here, it's him.

It looked like a big, brown finger.

891
01:20:08,370 --> 01:20:10,043
It was pointing right at me.

892
01:20:10,664 --> 01:20:13,133
If he really is the Greasy Strangler,

893
01:20:13,250 --> 01:20:14,672
you have to kill him.

894
01:21:03,759 --> 01:21:06,387
I can get greasy too.

895
01:21:06,512 --> 01:21:09,686
I can be a Greasy Strangler too.

896
01:21:09,806 --> 01:21:12,685
You're not the only Greasy Strangler.

897
01:21:13,227 --> 01:21:16,652
I'm the Greasy Strangler too.

898
01:21:51,390 --> 01:21:53,893
(GASPING)

899
01:22:55,078 --> 01:22:56,500
You're all right, Brayden.

900
01:22:58,206 --> 01:22:59,583
Thanks, Dad.

901
01:22:59,708 --> 01:23:02,086
That means a lot, coming from you.

902
01:23:04,379 --> 01:23:07,178
We never really got along, though, did we?

903
01:23:07,299 --> 01:23:08,300
Yeah.

904
01:23:09,259 --> 01:23:11,887
By which I mean, nah.

905
01:23:13,680 --> 01:23:16,058
It wasn't always like that.

906
01:23:16,183 --> 01:23:19,483
You were a cute baby.
I used to love cradling you.

907
01:23:20,729 --> 01:23:23,573
You cheesy old cornball.

908
01:23:23,690 --> 01:23:28,116
Well... you were a baby, a tiny baby.

909
01:23:39,164 --> 01:23:42,168
You probably won't remember this,
but when you were small,

910
01:23:42,292 --> 01:23:46,092
we stayed on John Travolta's
luxury yacht in the Caribbean.

911
01:23:46,213 --> 01:23:50,059
We sailed around the islands
from Port-au-Prince to Montego Bay.

912
01:23:51,009 --> 01:23:54,013
Wow, I really don't remember that.

913
01:23:54,137 --> 01:23:55,605
You called it.

914
01:23:55,722 --> 01:23:58,396
Yeah, and John said you were a good kid

915
01:23:58,517 --> 01:24:00,360
and you had good energy.

916
01:24:01,478 --> 01:24:02,821
OK.

917
01:24:02,938 --> 01:24:05,862
John Travolta talking about Brayden.

918
01:24:05,982 --> 01:24:08,781
I'm kind of trying to process that.

919
01:24:08,902 --> 01:24:12,031
Me and John were busting our butts
on a big business deal.

920
01:24:13,490 --> 01:24:15,242
That's kind of amazing, Dad.

921
01:24:15,784 --> 01:24:18,253
Yeah, he offered me a chance
to move to New Orleans

922
01:24:18,370 --> 01:24:23,501
to open a big disco
with very expensive drinks,

923
01:24:23,625 --> 01:24:25,298
a billiards room,

924
01:24:25,419 --> 01:24:28,263
a cherry-coloured, funky dance floor.

925
01:24:28,380 --> 01:24:32,226
There was going to be a pink limo
to cruise the Big Easy

926
01:24:32,342 --> 01:24:35,061
and pick up those hot dancing mamasitas.

927
01:24:36,179 --> 01:24:39,183
It was gonna be called
"John and Ron's Dance Jungle".

928
01:24:40,809 --> 01:24:43,232
But you were small.

929
01:24:43,353 --> 01:24:46,653
I really didn't wanna leave you
with Mum and Ricky Prickles.

930
01:24:48,859 --> 01:24:51,237
Are you glad I moved in with you?

931
01:24:52,988 --> 01:24:57,915
Hey, I'd rather be here with you
than in New Orleans with John Travolta.

932
01:25:01,204 --> 01:25:03,582
But you really annoyed me.

933
01:25:03,707 --> 01:25:08,008
Your food was dry, and you made it
really hard to score ass.

934
01:25:09,171 --> 01:25:10,889
Look, I'm being honest here.

935
01:25:11,840 --> 01:25:13,842
Fair enough, I reckon, mate.

936
01:25:14,926 --> 01:25:18,556
That's probably why I screwed
your girlfriend up the butthole.

937
01:25:20,265 --> 01:25:22,108
I reckon, mate.

938
01:25:24,394 --> 01:25:27,523
She was disgusting, wasn't she?

939
01:25:28,315 --> 01:25:29,316
Yeah.

940
01:25:30,567 --> 01:25:32,194
She was gross.

941
01:25:33,028 --> 01:25:35,656
Gotta say, she was kind of gross.

942
01:25:35,781 --> 01:25:38,580
Her pussy hair was like dried grass.

943
01:25:39,993 --> 01:25:43,497
Yeah, like the kind you see
on those African wildlife shows,

944
01:25:43,622 --> 01:25:45,966
sort of all dry and orangey.

945
01:25:47,292 --> 01:25:48,339
(LAUGHING)

946
01:25:53,089 --> 01:25:55,262
She faked all her orgasms with me.

947
01:25:55,383 --> 01:25:57,477
She definitely did with you.

948
01:25:58,804 --> 01:26:00,147
We don't need her.

949
01:26:19,658 --> 01:26:22,081
Let's kill Ricky Prickles.

950
01:26:25,539 --> 01:26:28,383
BOTH: Let's kill Ricky Prickles.

951
01:26:28,500 --> 01:26:31,128
Let's kill Ricky Prickles.

952
01:26:31,253 --> 01:26:34,507
Let's kill Ricky Prickles!

953
01:26:34,631 --> 01:26:36,633
(LAUGHING)

954
01:26:59,155 --> 01:27:01,374
Fuck you, guys!

955
01:27:01,491 --> 01:27:04,495
I am professional sprinter!

956
01:27:04,619 --> 01:27:06,838
I am Ricky Prickles!

957
01:27:06,955 --> 01:27:08,923
You'll never catch me!

958
01:27:09,040 --> 01:27:10,166
Oh, fuck.

959
01:27:10,292 --> 01:27:12,260
(SCREAMING)

960
01:29:07,742 --> 01:29:09,210
(SNARLING)

961
01:29:09,327 --> 01:29:10,670
(GROANING)

962
01:29:16,793 --> 01:29:18,010
(SCREAM)
