1
00:02:33,262 --> 00:02:35,140
<i>When I was 12 years old,</i>

2
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:38,099
<i>my father was the Governor of Virginia.</i>

3
00:02:38,435 --> 00:02:40,271
<i>And none of us knew it at that time,</i>

4
00:02:40,371 --> 00:02:44,875
<i>but our world was about to explode
over the issue of slavery in America.</i>

5
00:02:44,975 --> 00:02:48,512
<i>My father's heart had long
since changed on the topic,</i>

6
00:02:48,612 --> 00:02:53,250
<i>and one night, he took me to a place
that would forever change my own.</i>

7
00:02:53,350 --> 00:02:56,553
- Reading the Englishman again?
- Will I be shot for treason, Father?

8
00:02:57,253 --> 00:02:59,256
Most likely.

9
00:02:59,756 --> 00:03:02,274
Another one of those long titles, is it?

10
00:03:02,374 --> 00:03:04,428
"The Personal History,
Adventures, Experience,

11
00:03:04,528 --> 00:03:07,863
"Observation of David Copperfield,
the Younger of Blunderstone Rookery..."

12
00:03:07,963 --> 00:03:10,466
Which he never meant
to publish on any account.

13
00:03:11,266 --> 00:03:13,570
You read it. Guess that's why it's here.

14
00:03:13,670 --> 00:03:14,705
Suppose so.

15
00:03:15,305 --> 00:03:17,541
Get your coat, John.

16
00:03:17,641 --> 00:03:20,577
We're going to take a little ride.

17
00:03:20,677 --> 00:03:23,347
I don't think I like these
surprise trips anymore, father.

18
00:03:23,747 --> 00:03:26,083
'Cause they're usually lessons in life?

19
00:03:26,183 --> 00:03:27,968
Exactly.

20
00:03:28,318 --> 00:03:31,588
Well, tell me about the play
your mother took you to in Philadelphia.

21
00:03:31,988 --> 00:03:34,124
You mean "Uncle Tom's Cabin"?

22
00:03:34,224 --> 00:03:36,827
And why have we not talked about it?

23
00:03:36,927 --> 00:03:38,829
Because we'll disagree,

24
00:03:38,929 --> 00:03:43,447
and disagreeing with you
is so... disagreeable.

25
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:47,037
Your mother said
you were not impressed by it.

26
00:03:47,137 --> 00:03:50,872
Think it's all made up
by the people who don't like us.

27
00:03:52,375 --> 00:03:54,578
Yes. Well...

28
00:03:54,978 --> 00:03:57,346
there's lots of those in Philadelphia.

29
00:04:03,886 --> 00:04:07,157
All right, ladies and gentlemen!
We are about to get started!

30
00:04:07,257 --> 00:04:11,932
Step on up! Step on up! You're gonna
love what we have on store tonight...

31
00:04:13,364 --> 00:04:14,548
A slave auction.

32
00:04:14,748 --> 00:04:19,085
Doubtless those people in Philadelphia
would not approve.

33
00:04:23,739 --> 00:04:26,058
- You're not coming?
- John...

34
00:04:26,158 --> 00:04:30,781
I have never known you to need
help making up your own mind.

35
00:04:31,882 --> 00:04:35,360
These slaves are trained by some
of our most respected citizens

36
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:39,056
in the central Virginia area.
Oyez! Oyez!

37
00:04:39,156 --> 00:04:42,459
Step on up, ladies and gentlemen!
Sale's about to begin!

38
00:04:42,559 --> 00:04:44,728
A fine lot of slaves
belonging to the estate

39
00:04:44,828 --> 00:04:46,797
of the late Colonel William
Jasper of Amelia,

40
00:04:47,097 --> 00:04:49,466
sold in no fault,
but to sell the estate!

41
00:04:49,566 --> 00:04:53,938
We got all kinds. Old ones, young ones,
men and women, gals and boys!

42
00:04:54,038 --> 00:04:55,987
And as some of you may or may not know,

43
00:04:56,087 --> 00:05:00,945
Colonel Jasper's plantation slaves made him
a pretty penny for the last 20 years!

44
00:05:01,045 --> 00:05:04,814
Gentlemen, what we have
to offer here is so damn good,

45
00:05:04,914 --> 00:05:07,915
old Mr. Lumpkin even up
and married one of 'em!

46
00:05:10,053 --> 00:05:12,890
You won't find the mark
of a whip on a one of 'em!

47
00:05:12,990 --> 00:05:16,860
We're not talking some low-class
Louisiana branding-iron stock!

48
00:05:17,010 --> 00:05:20,631
We got the best slave stock
from all of central Virginia here tonight!

49
00:05:20,731 --> 00:05:24,167
Colonel Jasper's staff represents
the finest stock in the state!

50
00:05:24,267 --> 00:05:26,890
This is the best group
of dining room servants, farmhands,

51
00:05:26,990 --> 00:05:29,205
cooks, milkers,
seamstresses, washerwomen,

52
00:05:29,305 --> 00:05:33,108
and the most promising group of sassy
young females just ready to breed.

53
00:05:34,710 --> 00:05:38,748
Martha Ann is the favorite
of the household.

54
00:05:38,848 --> 00:05:42,759
Perfectly healthy, no blemish at all.

55
00:05:43,049 --> 00:05:44,917
Look at that complexion.

56
00:05:46,155 --> 00:05:48,058
I offer Martha Ann at a reduced price,

57
00:05:48,158 --> 00:05:51,346
because it is the wish of all concerned
to keep them together.

58
00:05:51,446 --> 00:05:54,158
Now, Israel here is not what you
would call an able-bodied man,

59
00:05:54,258 --> 00:05:57,484
having broke his leg in the field,
which didn't exactly mend right,

60
00:05:57,584 --> 00:05:59,956
but he can do all sorts of light work,
and you can have him

61
00:06:00,056 --> 00:06:01,937
and the young'uns mighty cheap!

62
00:06:02,037 --> 00:06:04,045
Masters...

63
00:06:04,545 --> 00:06:09,579
if you'll buy me,
the children and Martha Ann,

64
00:06:09,679 --> 00:06:14,148
God knows I'll work myself to death.

65
00:06:16,752 --> 00:06:19,354
Come on. No bids at all?

66
00:06:21,223 --> 00:06:23,494
400. Do I hear 450?

67
00:06:23,594 --> 00:06:27,431
Come on, people, 450!
Look at her! He can work!

68
00:06:27,831 --> 00:06:32,202
This is one of the best slave lots we're
gonna see all night, ladies and gentlemen!

69
00:06:32,402 --> 00:06:33,964
400 going once.

70
00:06:34,064 --> 00:06:37,207
400 going twice. Sold! Will you take
Israel and the young'uns with her?

71
00:06:37,307 --> 00:06:41,411
No. I'm lucky to be able
to afford one as it is.

72
00:06:41,511 --> 00:06:43,948
I don't need no more mouths
to feed than hers.

73
00:06:44,048 --> 00:06:47,516
No, please! No! Don't leave me!

74
00:07:01,898 --> 00:07:05,529
- Don't make me!
- You'll have more children, Missy.

75
00:07:05,629 --> 00:07:08,352
- Come on!
- No! Israel!

76
00:07:09,172 --> 00:07:11,241
No! Israel!

77
00:07:11,941 --> 00:07:14,197
Ladies and gentlemen...

78
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:30,043
<i>Five years later, the Civil War began
closing in on the Shenandoah Valley,</i>

79
00:07:30,893 --> 00:07:33,864
<i>the place that was home to the military
school my father had sent me</i>

80
00:07:33,964 --> 00:07:37,298
<i>when he became a general
in the Confederate Army.</i>

81
00:07:37,698 --> 00:07:39,721
<i>I was 17 years old...</i>

82
00:07:39,821 --> 00:07:43,193
<i>and in my second year
at the Virginia Military Institute.</i>

83
00:07:43,293 --> 00:07:46,473
Johnny Wise! Always in a hurry!

84
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:55,119
You think he'll do?
He's a rabbit, a mouse.

85
00:07:55,719 --> 00:07:58,689
And he's perfect,
like he shipped straight from heaven.

86
00:07:59,389 --> 00:08:01,623
- Round up the boys.
- All right.

87
00:08:08,463 --> 00:08:10,514
Good morning, young sir.

88
00:08:10,614 --> 00:08:14,621
- Let me give you a hand to the barracks.
- But, sir, you're an upperclassman.

89
00:08:14,721 --> 00:08:18,741
This is true. One day,
you will be magnificent yourself,

90
00:08:18,841 --> 00:08:21,809
somehow find a way to repay my kindness.

91
00:08:26,215 --> 00:08:29,119
Well, imagine this.
A welcoming committee.

92
00:08:29,219 --> 00:08:32,189
Robert, come on and meet some
of the boys. This here's Duck.

93
00:08:32,589 --> 00:08:34,542
Let's get you unpacked.

94
00:08:34,642 --> 00:08:39,256
And this is Jack Stanard,
a real soldier and a hard man indeed.

95
00:08:39,356 --> 00:08:42,136
You want to grow up and be a man,
you pay attention to him and not me.

96
00:08:42,236 --> 00:08:45,369
You looking for an easy ride,
you come to the wrong place.

97
00:08:45,469 --> 00:08:49,022
This handsome creature
is our resident Jew.

98
00:08:49,122 --> 00:08:51,990
His name is actually Moses,
and he's an artist.

99
00:08:52,090 --> 00:08:55,812
He's got the best heart of the bunch if you
ever need to cry on somebody's shoulder.

100
00:08:55,912 --> 00:08:59,683
We'll start by me telling you all about
Sammy here so you can protect yourself.

101
00:09:00,799 --> 00:09:04,852
Couldn't you do one of them,
but without the clothes?

102
00:09:07,163 --> 00:09:09,599
What have we here?

103
00:09:09,699 --> 00:09:13,630
- What's that?
- Well, that looks like food to me, son.

104
00:09:13,730 --> 00:09:17,934
Anybody tell you there's a war going on?
Concealed foodstuffs, that's contraband.

105
00:09:18,034 --> 00:09:21,004
Clear violation
of Institute regulations.

106
00:09:21,104 --> 00:09:24,875
- Immediate dismissal.
- Might even be criminal.

107
00:09:24,975 --> 00:09:27,341
Oh, Bobby, how could you?

108
00:09:27,546 --> 00:09:31,213
Cadet Stanard, could you please fetch
the Officer of the Day?

109
00:09:33,882 --> 00:09:36,384
I don't know how it got there.

110
00:09:45,527 --> 00:09:49,345
This is Cadet Garland Jefferson,
Officer of the Day,

111
00:09:49,445 --> 00:09:51,366
whose jurisdiction covers this matter.

112
00:09:51,466 --> 00:09:54,659
And since his family are direct
descendants of Thomas Jefferson

113
00:09:54,879 --> 00:09:59,807
- and own the eighth-largest plantation...
- That'll do, Atwill.

114
00:10:01,243 --> 00:10:05,582
Now, if I take charge,
this goes to the faculty,

115
00:10:05,932 --> 00:10:08,001
which ends horribly for the boy.

116
00:10:08,451 --> 00:10:11,355
- Please, sir.
- Could we have Duck fetch John Wise?

117
00:10:11,755 --> 00:10:14,317
Handle this within the barracks?

118
00:10:28,769 --> 00:10:32,576
Bobby, this is John Wise,
our unofficial Chief Magistrate.

119
00:10:33,326 --> 00:10:35,645
Now, his father was once governor
of this Commonwealth,

120
00:10:35,745 --> 00:10:39,677
so he is as close to an aristocrat
as you can find in a democracy.

121
00:10:47,306 --> 00:10:49,646
Look me in the eye, son.

122
00:10:50,476 --> 00:10:53,707
Tell me the truth as if
your very life depended on it.

123
00:10:56,048 --> 00:10:59,052
- Did you do this?
- No, sir.

124
00:10:59,152 --> 00:11:02,311
I swear on my father's soul.

125
00:11:05,524 --> 00:11:10,590
I believe this child. I ask that we
be allowed to settle this here.

126
00:11:11,063 --> 00:11:12,065
All right.

127
00:11:12,165 --> 00:11:15,969
You understand, son, if this gets out,
it could be bad for Cadet Jefferson.

128
00:11:16,669 --> 00:11:19,800
Therefore, there must be
some evidence of punishment.

129
00:11:21,973 --> 00:11:24,503
Will you submit to a caning?

130
00:11:25,377 --> 00:11:31,528
Yes, sir, and thank you
for being so... merciful.

131
00:11:32,618 --> 00:11:35,014
Take your shirt off.

132
00:11:59,044 --> 00:12:02,570
First-year cadets are known as rats.

133
00:12:03,282 --> 00:12:05,855
You are a rat.

134
00:12:05,955 --> 00:12:09,289
But you're a special rat,
you understand?

135
00:12:09,689 --> 00:12:11,274
You're my rat.

136
00:12:11,374 --> 00:12:16,262
You're under my protection
and under the protection of all here.

137
00:12:16,362 --> 00:12:18,597
Are you with us, Robert?

138
00:12:19,023 --> 00:12:21,501
Oh, yes. Oh, yes, sir.

139
00:12:21,601 --> 00:12:24,020
I want you always to remember
the horrible injustice

140
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:27,240
you thought was gonna
befall you here today...

141
00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:32,312
of one human using his authority over
another without decency or conscience

142
00:12:32,412 --> 00:12:36,810
and of the need to assert a code of honor
that transcends the temptations of power.

143
00:12:41,419 --> 00:12:44,424
I hereby raise you
above the level of common rat.

144
00:12:45,424 --> 00:12:49,305
You shall be known in this company...

145
00:12:49,405 --> 00:12:51,678
as Sir Rat.

146
00:12:54,734 --> 00:12:58,338
Now put your shirt on, son, before we
find ourselves a healthier specimen.

147
00:12:58,538 --> 00:13:00,740
- You hungry, boy?
- Oh, yes, sir.

148
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:03,509
What do you gentlemen say
to a little midnight requisition?

149
00:13:03,609 --> 00:13:07,057
- What?
- Never mind! It's tradition.

150
00:13:14,787 --> 00:13:16,683
Right there.

151
00:13:19,392 --> 00:13:21,445
All right.

152
00:13:22,495 --> 00:13:23,997
Come around.

153
00:13:24,997 --> 00:13:26,933
Help me with this doorknob.

154
00:13:27,033 --> 00:13:29,536
- Easy. Easy.
- Go ahead.

155
00:13:30,136 --> 00:13:34,041
- Oh, that smells good.
- Oh, that does smell good!

156
00:13:34,141 --> 00:13:36,526
- There's us some bread, boys.
- Here we go.

157
00:13:36,626 --> 00:13:38,922
That's pretty good right there.

158
00:13:39,612 --> 00:13:42,339
That one's mine. That one's mine.

159
00:13:46,318 --> 00:13:49,383
Well, now, evening, Judge.

160
00:13:53,258 --> 00:13:55,995
No need to be afraid of Old Judge, boy.

161
00:13:56,095 --> 00:13:58,589
He's just a grumpy old slave.

162
00:13:58,689 --> 00:14:02,101
I may be the property of this Institute,

163
00:14:02,201 --> 00:14:04,324
but I have the ear of the Superintendent

164
00:14:04,424 --> 00:14:07,007
and the full trust and confidence
of the Commandant.

165
00:14:07,107 --> 00:14:11,211
- I'm the master of this bakery.
- You also have a cleaver.

166
00:14:11,811 --> 00:14:16,342
There's nothing worse in a time
of conflict than a thief of food.

167
00:14:18,483 --> 00:14:21,360
Tell the Judge why we're here, son.

168
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:25,292
We're... we real hungry, Mr. Judge,

169
00:14:25,392 --> 00:14:28,135
and those loaves smell awful good.

170
00:14:28,235 --> 00:14:30,696
I'm new just today,

171
00:14:30,796 --> 00:14:34,661
but Mr. Wise here tells me that the bread
is the best part of this school.

172
00:14:38,503 --> 00:14:41,326
Go on and get yourself
one of these loaves, son.

173
00:14:41,426 --> 00:14:44,544
- I suppose I could spare three or four.
- Thank you, Judge.

174
00:14:44,644 --> 00:14:46,739
Oh, that's good.

175
00:14:49,213 --> 00:14:51,751
- That's fresh.
- I'm not here for a handout, Judge.

176
00:14:52,051 --> 00:14:54,988
I'm here to negotiate
a business arrangement.

177
00:14:55,288 --> 00:14:57,990
Now, you seen the best of us
on the shooting range.

178
00:14:58,090 --> 00:15:00,894
Jewish boy's the best, then you.

179
00:15:01,394 --> 00:15:05,298
We'll bring in some squirrel,
rabbit and some possum,

180
00:15:05,398 --> 00:15:07,634
harvest a fugitive chicken or two.

181
00:15:07,734 --> 00:15:11,431
Your people share in the meat.
In return, we liberate some bread.

182
00:15:13,138 --> 00:15:15,575
See, the terms of this arrangement

183
00:15:15,875 --> 00:15:18,758
is a little more serious
for some parties than others.

184
00:15:19,578 --> 00:15:23,999
If this comes crashing down,
it will not fall on you.

185
00:15:27,552 --> 00:15:32,157
- Tell me this one is different.
- We think so.

186
00:15:32,257 --> 00:15:34,494
He's not afraid to take action.

187
00:15:34,894 --> 00:15:38,064
It's a welcome change
from your other generals.

188
00:15:38,164 --> 00:15:41,134
Some call Grant a butcher.

189
00:15:41,234 --> 00:15:43,081
Well, sir...

190
00:15:43,181 --> 00:15:47,064
that may be precisely what we need.

191
00:15:55,747 --> 00:15:57,572
General...

192
00:15:57,672 --> 00:16:02,616
congratulations on your victory
and promotion.

193
00:16:03,722 --> 00:16:06,155
Gentlemen, thank you.

194
00:16:15,467 --> 00:16:20,573
They say you are the general
the nation has been praying for.

195
00:16:20,673 --> 00:16:23,176
They also say you fight like a savage.

196
00:16:23,276 --> 00:16:25,612
Oh, I agree with both.

197
00:16:25,712 --> 00:16:29,682
War is not opera nor theater.
It is for winning.

198
00:16:30,182 --> 00:16:33,753
Winning ends the death,
ends the destruction, begins the healing.

199
00:16:33,953 --> 00:16:36,806
And to win, brutality is required?

200
00:16:36,906 --> 00:16:39,958
Each game has its rules, Mr. President.

201
00:16:40,359 --> 00:16:42,715
Are we to play chess or war?

202
00:16:44,429 --> 00:16:47,934
And if I were to name you
General in Chief?

203
00:16:48,034 --> 00:16:52,271
I will attack our enemies
at all times and all places.

204
00:16:52,371 --> 00:16:55,493
I will take away his crops,

205
00:16:55,593 --> 00:16:58,544
his animals, the food he has sheltered,

206
00:16:58,644 --> 00:17:01,848
his railroads, his industry,
his clothing,

207
00:17:01,948 --> 00:17:06,660
his ammunition, his gunpowder,
his steel, his armament, his salt,

208
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:09,522
and I will take from him
the flower of his youth.

209
00:17:09,922 --> 00:17:13,392
I will destroy everything my enemy loves
and anything that might give him

210
00:17:13,492 --> 00:17:15,663
the means or the hope to prevail.

211
00:17:17,763 --> 00:17:20,727
Do you see me as a monster,
Mr. President?

212
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,288
I see you as a true general.

213
00:17:25,388 --> 00:17:29,669
The only way back across the Blue Ridge
and into our flank...

214
00:17:31,309 --> 00:17:33,696
...through the New Market Gap,

215
00:17:33,796 --> 00:17:35,615
and that's where Grant will send 'em.

216
00:17:35,715 --> 00:17:38,819
Sir, General Lee does not believe
an attack will come this spring.

217
00:17:38,919 --> 00:17:41,854
Well, then, General Lee is dead wrong.

218
00:17:41,954 --> 00:17:45,124
The Federals will come and soon.

219
00:17:45,424 --> 00:17:47,184
Inform my brigade commanders

220
00:17:47,284 --> 00:17:50,930
to concentrate the army and move
at best speed towards New Market.

221
00:17:51,730 --> 00:17:54,505
And I am going to need
everything they got.

222
00:17:54,605 --> 00:17:57,837
Sir, you're asking me to tell
the commander General Lee is wrong?

223
00:17:57,937 --> 00:18:01,274
Well, thank God you been listening.
I won't have to repeat myself.

224
00:18:01,474 --> 00:18:04,911
If General Grant is the wolf
and we are the lamb...

225
00:18:05,411 --> 00:18:08,648
then New Market Gap
is surely our throat,

226
00:18:08,748 --> 00:18:12,238
and trust me, the wolf will come.

227
00:18:13,018 --> 00:18:15,802
Shoulder arms!

228
00:18:16,821 --> 00:18:19,601
Order arms!

229
00:18:20,459 --> 00:18:22,334
Shoulder arms!

230
00:18:24,396 --> 00:18:27,248
Order arms!

231
00:18:28,967 --> 00:18:31,079
Shoulder arms!

232
00:18:38,743 --> 00:18:42,913
- I'm okay. I'm okay.
- Order arms!

233
00:18:45,083 --> 00:18:47,613
Shoulder arms!

234
00:18:51,656 --> 00:18:53,953
I got it. I'm good.

235
00:19:00,632 --> 00:19:03,335
Sam, help me. Come on. Come on.

236
00:19:03,435 --> 00:19:05,204
Sir, the battalion is formed and ready!

237
00:19:05,304 --> 00:19:08,138
All cadets are present
or accounted for, sir!

238
00:19:13,545 --> 00:19:16,409
Ladies, can you help us out?

239
00:19:18,333 --> 00:19:20,996
Thank you very much.

240
00:19:21,419 --> 00:19:23,615
Oh, watch him.

241
00:19:42,241 --> 00:19:46,144
- We...
- May we help you?

242
00:19:46,244 --> 00:19:48,047
We...

243
00:19:49,616 --> 00:19:51,711
Is he dead?

244
00:19:53,618 --> 00:19:56,322
What kind of thing is that to say?

245
00:20:02,794 --> 00:20:04,630
We got company!

246
00:20:04,730 --> 00:20:07,533
- Sam, what happened?
- I don't know.

247
00:20:07,633 --> 00:20:09,635
Ma'am.

248
00:20:09,735 --> 00:20:11,599
Ma'am?

249
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:18,124
- Oh, my goodness. He isn't dead, is he?
- No, ma'am.

250
00:20:18,224 --> 00:20:21,414
Notwithstanding what that girl
decided to the contrary.

251
00:20:21,514 --> 00:20:24,367
Well, young man,
that girl is my daughter,

252
00:20:24,467 --> 00:20:28,337
and we're not from these parts,
and she has never seen a cadet before,

253
00:20:28,487 --> 00:20:32,958
so she would not know what is normal
or not normal around here.

254
00:20:33,058 --> 00:20:35,227
And the only thing she decided

255
00:20:35,327 --> 00:20:41,994
is that there is an intellectually
impaired cadet at my doorstep with...

256
00:20:44,769 --> 00:20:48,068
perhaps a drunken colleague?

257
00:20:49,275 --> 00:20:53,245
Well, bring him in.
Let's see what we can do.

258
00:20:53,345 --> 00:20:54,716
- Let's go.
- All right.

259
00:21:14,833 --> 00:21:16,598
You're...

260
00:21:16,698 --> 00:21:20,507
- not from around here?
- I should say not.

261
00:21:21,607 --> 00:21:23,643
My aunt lives here.

262
00:21:23,843 --> 00:21:28,844
We live up at New Market,
you know, up north where Jackson fought.

263
00:21:32,901 --> 00:21:34,841
So is this the best you can do?

264
00:21:37,055 --> 00:21:39,239
At conversation?

265
00:21:41,626 --> 00:21:43,689
Well...

266
00:21:49,801 --> 00:21:51,596
Yeah.

267
00:21:54,005 --> 00:21:55,558
Pleasure chatting with you.

268
00:21:55,958 --> 00:21:58,878
While I'm taking the main army
south towards Richmond,

269
00:21:58,978 --> 00:22:01,847
I'm sending General Sigel west
to the Shenandoah Valley,

270
00:22:01,947 --> 00:22:03,883
Lee's breadbasket.

271
00:22:03,983 --> 00:22:07,938
If we take the Valley before the summer
harvest, we'll cut off Lee's food supply

272
00:22:08,038 --> 00:22:09,755
and end the war.

273
00:22:09,855 --> 00:22:12,057
Excuse me, gentlemen.

274
00:22:12,157 --> 00:22:15,695
This campaign is going to be
something of a family affair.

275
00:22:15,795 --> 00:22:19,465
Our First Lady, Mary Todd Lincoln,
is a cousin to the Rebel general

276
00:22:19,565 --> 00:22:23,769
we're going to be facing in the Valley,
John C. Breckinridge.

277
00:22:23,869 --> 00:22:27,172
You're wondering what the hell
you're doing here.

278
00:22:27,272 --> 00:22:29,215
As a matter of fact, sir, I am.

279
00:22:29,315 --> 00:22:32,311
Well, Franz Sigel
is a politician, not a soldier.

280
00:22:32,411 --> 00:22:35,548
All he has to do is take the railroad,
but I'm not gonna take any chances.

281
00:22:35,648 --> 00:22:40,546
I'm gonna attach you and your guns
and a regiment of Ohio boys.

282
00:22:49,026 --> 00:22:52,164
Is that your daily briefing from Mary?

283
00:22:52,264 --> 00:22:57,203
Ever since she turned 10, the girl just
won't let me run the war without her.

284
00:22:57,403 --> 00:23:03,004
Well, then, what does your daughter
say about the New Market Gap?

285
00:23:05,610 --> 00:23:09,915
She says that Grant has a big problem.

286
00:23:10,015 --> 00:23:13,451
Yeah, the only sizable force
he has to throw at us...

287
00:23:13,551 --> 00:23:15,634
is Franz Sigel.

288
00:23:17,282 --> 00:23:21,368
She says Grant knows
that Sigel's an idiot, so...

289
00:23:21,468 --> 00:23:24,597
he will surely send a real soldier
along to help him out.

290
00:23:25,646 --> 00:23:27,938
But she thinks...

291
00:23:28,038 --> 00:23:30,920
Sigel is almost certain to take offense...

292
00:23:31,670 --> 00:23:34,139
and resist the help.

293
00:23:34,239 --> 00:23:36,302
Smart girl?

294
00:23:37,442 --> 00:23:39,779
So then at New Market...

295
00:23:39,879 --> 00:23:44,604
We will break Grant's back
and save Lee's Army. Jolly.

296
00:23:46,084 --> 00:23:48,354
Unless, of course...

297
00:23:48,954 --> 00:23:51,257
the soldiers I asked for
don't arrive in time.

298
00:23:51,357 --> 00:23:53,593
Which case, we'll lose the war.

299
00:23:53,693 --> 00:23:55,862
It's my fault, it's your fault,

300
00:23:55,962 --> 00:23:59,886
and from the Union gallows
next to you, I'll surely remark...

301
00:23:59,986 --> 00:24:01,480
that I told you so.

302
00:24:15,513 --> 00:24:18,868
- We already got our delivery, son.
- This is from me.

303
00:24:18,968 --> 00:24:23,271
- This is extra.
- One slave to another?

304
00:24:24,689 --> 00:24:29,429
Not exactly. I just thought, you know,
some families could use these.

305
00:24:29,529 --> 00:24:31,230
Of course I do.

306
00:24:31,330 --> 00:24:34,733
This ain't about your people
and the Pharaoh...

307
00:24:34,833 --> 00:24:37,609
and you feeling something
them other boys can't feel?

308
00:24:42,039 --> 00:24:45,294
- What's that you got there?
- Oh. Oh, nothing.

309
00:24:45,894 --> 00:24:48,423
You let me be the judge of that.

310
00:25:04,196 --> 00:25:06,025
Well...

311
00:25:06,598 --> 00:25:09,592
my, my, look at this.

312
00:25:10,535 --> 00:25:12,304
I thank you for these.

313
00:25:12,404 --> 00:25:16,086
There are some children
who won't be hungry tonight.

314
00:25:20,411 --> 00:25:23,313
And... who's this?

315
00:25:26,150 --> 00:25:28,954
Someone who will go hungry.

316
00:25:29,054 --> 00:25:32,284
- All right, sir. 18 credits.
- Thank you, sir.

317
00:25:32,657 --> 00:25:36,495
- How much are the sausages, sir?
- Get behind, rat!

318
00:25:36,595 --> 00:25:38,664
- Hey!
- I said get behind!

319
00:25:38,764 --> 00:25:41,361
No! I was here first, sir.

320
00:25:44,001 --> 00:25:47,573
What's going on here?
This is my rat! Hands off!

321
00:25:47,673 --> 00:25:50,275
Butt out, John, if you know
what's good for you.

322
00:25:50,375 --> 00:25:53,312
You have no right to push
a cadet out of your way.

323
00:25:53,412 --> 00:25:55,280
He's just a rat.

324
00:25:55,380 --> 00:25:58,384
Don't pretend to boss me around, Johnny.

325
00:25:58,484 --> 00:26:03,289
Wasn't it your father, the governor,
who opposed secession?

326
00:26:03,989 --> 00:26:06,353
The old fool.

327
00:26:14,066 --> 00:26:16,796
- Come on!
- Hey, stop it!

328
00:26:18,403 --> 00:26:22,241
Down there, stand fast!
You're all under arrest!

329
00:26:22,341 --> 00:26:24,744
- This ain't over, Johnny!
- You bet it ain't!

330
00:26:25,044 --> 00:26:28,771
- Come on. We gotta go!
- Hey! Hey!

331
00:26:34,986 --> 00:26:37,189
General Sigel, my respects.

332
00:26:37,289 --> 00:26:42,061
I have the honor of providing
artillery support for your advance.

333
00:26:42,461 --> 00:26:45,364
Welcome, dear Captain DuPont.

334
00:26:46,464 --> 00:26:48,968
You have been sent
by General Grant to spy on us?

335
00:26:49,068 --> 00:26:54,206
I wish only to provide the best possible
support for your command, sir.

336
00:26:54,306 --> 00:26:56,835
Are there any maps of the route?

337
00:26:57,642 --> 00:27:03,454
Any intelligence of the enemy's
dispositions or intentions?

338
00:27:08,519 --> 00:27:10,989
General Grant is your patron.

339
00:27:11,142 --> 00:27:15,158
Let him provide whatever you need.

340
00:27:20,097 --> 00:27:23,536
Libby... Miss Clinedinst,
I need to tell you something.

341
00:27:24,136 --> 00:27:26,732
When I first saw you...

342
00:27:28,472 --> 00:27:31,377
your eyes... No, not "your eyes."
Something else.

343
00:27:31,477 --> 00:27:33,812
Your... your mouth...

344
00:27:33,912 --> 00:27:36,615
All right, then I say, "Good evening."

345
00:27:36,715 --> 00:27:40,485
She's gonna say, "Good evening..."

346
00:27:40,585 --> 00:27:43,088
She doesn't know my name.

347
00:27:43,188 --> 00:27:46,384
- She doesn't know my name.
- You need to come inside?

348
00:27:48,819 --> 00:27:53,266
Well, I better not, given my recent
problems with conversation.

349
00:27:53,566 --> 00:27:55,735
A wise boy.

350
00:27:56,235 --> 00:27:58,218
Shall I get you something?

351
00:27:58,637 --> 00:28:01,333
Conversation would be nice.

352
00:28:15,153 --> 00:28:17,957
Are you counting on an uncontrollable
attraction to the uniform?

353
00:28:18,057 --> 00:28:19,472
Wouldn't help.

354
00:28:20,459 --> 00:28:23,922
You'd soon find out
I'm not much of a soldier.

355
00:28:24,762 --> 00:28:28,994
See, I didn't think that I believed
in anything enough to fight for it...

356
00:28:30,468 --> 00:28:32,053
until tonight.

357
00:28:33,471 --> 00:28:35,608
And what is that, Mr...

358
00:28:35,708 --> 00:28:39,172
Sam. Mr. Sam.

359
00:28:40,278 --> 00:28:43,563
What is it you believe in tonight?

360
00:28:45,116 --> 00:28:47,945
I believe in something...

361
00:28:48,345 --> 00:28:50,593
more than just...

362
00:28:50,693 --> 00:28:54,032
sudden, superficial attraction.

363
00:28:56,127 --> 00:28:58,977
Tonight I believe in love
at first sight.

364
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:10,208
Get him.

365
00:29:10,308 --> 00:29:13,816
That's what you get
for giving away food!

366
00:29:16,081 --> 00:29:19,051
I think you should stick to drawing.
That's a woman's work.

367
00:29:19,451 --> 00:29:23,148
I see how you could pick up
on a local with that. Nice.

368
00:29:24,356 --> 00:29:28,487
- Well, what do we have here?
- I hope he's got warm bread.

369
00:29:29,462 --> 00:29:31,183
It's Old Judge, sir!

370
00:29:32,630 --> 00:29:36,401
I went to the bakery
to make our delivery,

371
00:29:36,501 --> 00:29:38,704
and the soldiers
were all in there with him!

372
00:29:38,804 --> 00:29:42,775
Dear God. Do you know
where they took him?

373
00:29:42,875 --> 00:29:47,339
To the faculty, Captain,
the one called Chinook.

374
00:29:48,512 --> 00:29:50,775
Get Jefferson.

375
00:30:06,864 --> 00:30:08,100
Was it very bad?

376
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:11,304
Ain't gonna be nothing compared
to what the hanging's gonna be.

377
00:30:11,404 --> 00:30:14,673
This don't make no sense.
They need the Judge.

378
00:30:15,073 --> 00:30:17,943
They can't need a slave, son.

379
00:30:18,043 --> 00:30:20,782
- But they can forgive one.
- Oh, yeah.

380
00:30:21,582 --> 00:30:24,091
Captain Chinook's just...

381
00:30:24,191 --> 00:30:26,018
dripping with the honey of forgiveness.

382
00:30:26,318 --> 00:30:28,888
Y'all, it's time to go.

383
00:30:34,574 --> 00:30:35,738
Johnny...

384
00:30:38,897 --> 00:30:43,096
weren't your fault, son. Hungry got fed.

385
00:30:45,202 --> 00:30:46,538
I promised.

386
00:30:46,638 --> 00:30:49,909
Don't you know
it's the other way around?

387
00:30:50,509 --> 00:30:53,094
Old men make the promises

388
00:30:53,194 --> 00:30:57,015
the young'uns got to pay on.

389
00:30:57,115 --> 00:30:59,144
That's war, ain't it?

390
00:31:01,552 --> 00:31:04,216
I'm coming back for you, Judge.

391
00:31:07,592 --> 00:31:09,309
- I'll stay.
- All right.

392
00:31:09,791 --> 00:31:11,890
Let's go, boys.

393
00:31:20,304 --> 00:31:21,941
He fed people who were starving.

394
00:31:22,041 --> 00:31:25,418
And hanging is the consequence
a slave faces for stealing food.

395
00:31:25,878 --> 00:31:28,147
He didn't steal it.

396
00:31:28,947 --> 00:31:30,348
I did, sir.

397
00:31:30,448 --> 00:31:33,752
No, Captain, it was I.

398
00:31:34,252 --> 00:31:37,223
- I did it, sir.
- I as well.

399
00:31:37,323 --> 00:31:41,023
And I bring the confession of Moses
Ezekiel, so it's five gallows, then.

400
00:31:41,123 --> 00:31:43,963
Shall I organize a detail
to assist the hangman?

401
00:31:44,263 --> 00:31:46,605
You know very well you won't be hanged.

402
00:31:46,705 --> 00:31:48,701
Are you so willing to end your careers?

403
00:31:48,801 --> 00:31:52,438
With all due respect, sir, who would offer
a career to five dishonorable men?

404
00:31:52,538 --> 00:31:55,274
What kind of satisfaction
could such a life bring?

405
00:31:55,774 --> 00:31:57,993
You too, Colonna?

406
00:31:58,293 --> 00:32:01,313
- Jefferson?
- Honor is honor, sir.

407
00:32:01,613 --> 00:32:05,710
It is the most precious quality
in our profession.

408
00:32:05,983 --> 00:32:09,549
- All for one, sir.
- That's the honor thing, sir.

409
00:32:16,380 --> 00:32:18,510
Get out of my sight.

410
00:32:18,610 --> 00:32:21,532
And don't be late for morning class.

411
00:32:21,632 --> 00:32:25,198
And, Jack, looks like I'm gonna get
some baked bread this morning.

412
00:32:27,404 --> 00:32:29,801
Get 'em out of here.

413
00:32:32,876 --> 00:32:37,483
So Echols and Wharton are, what,
joining us on foot?

414
00:32:37,583 --> 00:32:41,512
60 miles for Echols, 75 for Wharton.

415
00:32:41,654 --> 00:32:44,457
- Gentlemen.
- They can make it.

416
00:32:44,557 --> 00:32:49,354
If they march through the night, don't eat,
kill most of their horses, maybe.

417
00:32:51,028 --> 00:32:53,565
Well, there is one more
possible solution.

418
00:32:53,665 --> 00:32:57,169
We have 250 trained troops and artillery
less than 50 miles from Staunton...

419
00:32:57,269 --> 00:33:02,507
- Jesus, Charlie, the schoolboys again?
- Cadets. Just in reserve...

420
00:33:02,607 --> 00:33:05,010
and only if Wharton
and Echols are delayed.

421
00:33:05,110 --> 00:33:07,579
In reserve to fight.

422
00:33:07,679 --> 00:33:10,149
And if we have to put
those children in to fight,

423
00:33:10,249 --> 00:33:13,318
then what kind of dire circumstances
will they find themselves in?

424
00:33:13,418 --> 00:33:16,589
Yes, they are young,

425
00:33:16,689 --> 00:33:19,691
and, yes, you have told me on
six occasions in the last four days

426
00:33:19,791 --> 00:33:22,128
- that you will not permit them near the Gap.
- And I won't.

427
00:33:22,228 --> 00:33:24,699
But we do need them...

428
00:33:25,159 --> 00:33:26,662
in reserve...

429
00:33:29,066 --> 00:33:31,463
just in case, sir.

430
00:33:50,521 --> 00:33:52,984
The Yankees burned his home.

431
00:33:55,126 --> 00:33:57,424
The mill's gone.

432
00:33:58,230 --> 00:34:00,492
Everything's gone.

433
00:34:03,267 --> 00:34:05,571
His sister Margaret?

434
00:34:05,771 --> 00:34:08,040
His baby brother?

435
00:34:08,140 --> 00:34:10,335
No one knows.

436
00:34:10,741 --> 00:34:14,691
That there is your Grant, Johnny.
That's how he is.

437
00:34:19,015 --> 00:34:21,286
You take me...

438
00:34:21,386 --> 00:34:23,911
where I could get revenge.

439
00:34:40,137 --> 00:34:42,019
Son...

440
00:34:42,119 --> 00:34:44,653
I must speak to the superintendent.

441
00:34:45,743 --> 00:34:48,268
We do not expect General Sigel's
forces to proceed south

442
00:34:48,368 --> 00:34:51,150
through the valley at best speed,
but if they do...

443
00:34:51,250 --> 00:34:54,112
I understand. Of course.

444
00:35:00,758 --> 00:35:02,363
Thank you, Major.

445
00:35:06,263 --> 00:35:08,533
200-odd boys really gonna
make the difference?

446
00:35:08,633 --> 00:35:11,736
- Is the situation really that dire?
- I am quite sure.

447
00:35:11,836 --> 00:35:17,109
I have promised General Breckinridge
that you will be in Staunton by Thursday.

448
00:35:17,209 --> 00:35:20,338
That's 50 miles in 2 days.

449
00:35:23,447 --> 00:35:24,608
Yes, sir.

450
00:35:26,150 --> 00:35:28,908
Battalion, fall in!

451
00:35:29,008 --> 00:35:32,582
Quickly now! I said fall in!

452
00:35:33,726 --> 00:35:35,999
Attention to orders!

453
00:35:37,261 --> 00:35:41,400
The enemy in heavy force is advancing
up the Shenandoah Valley.

454
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:45,783
General Lee cannot spare forces
from the Army of Northern Virginia

455
00:35:45,883 --> 00:35:47,572
to meet this advance!

456
00:35:47,672 --> 00:35:51,093
All available forces from southwestern
Virginia and elsewhere

457
00:35:51,193 --> 00:35:56,315
are hereby ordered to assemble
in Staunton to defend the valley.

458
00:35:56,415 --> 00:35:59,685
The battalion of cadets
of the Virginia Military Institute

459
00:35:59,785 --> 00:36:03,722
is ordered to march
with four companies of infantry

460
00:36:03,822 --> 00:36:08,227
and one section of artillery
by the Valley Pike.

461
00:36:08,547 --> 00:36:12,832
All cadets will appear with canteen,
blanket and weapon

462
00:36:12,932 --> 00:36:16,600
at 8:00 tomorrow morning
prepared to march!

463
00:36:16,802 --> 00:36:18,830
That is all!

464
00:36:20,171 --> 00:36:21,880
Yeah!

465
00:36:31,399 --> 00:36:33,495
Dismissed!

466
00:36:37,855 --> 00:36:40,072
Revenge, Johnny.

467
00:36:40,172 --> 00:36:42,215
Revenge.

468
00:36:49,233 --> 00:36:52,004
- Scared?
- Are we really going to fight?

469
00:36:52,104 --> 00:36:53,916
They tell us no.

470
00:36:54,016 --> 00:36:56,608
We're gonna be held back in reserve,
but we can't be sure.

471
00:36:57,408 --> 00:37:00,212
Is that supposed to make me feel better?

472
00:37:00,612 --> 00:37:03,542
What makes you think
I want you to feel better?

473
00:37:04,815 --> 00:37:06,952
I want you to stay safe.

474
00:37:07,352 --> 00:37:09,981
Whatever happens, you stay with me.

475
00:37:13,424 --> 00:37:16,261
I guess we should declare a truce.

476
00:37:17,661 --> 00:37:20,098
- Of course.
- This ain't over, though.

477
00:37:20,198 --> 00:37:23,127
I'm still gonna whup you good.

478
00:38:03,507 --> 00:38:06,037
That boy is outside.

479
00:38:16,620 --> 00:38:19,184
Come to say goodbye, have you?

480
00:38:24,095 --> 00:38:26,311
Absolutely.

481
00:38:26,711 --> 00:38:29,662
I'm gonna miss this old house.

482
00:38:33,169 --> 00:38:36,908
Women's work, darning socks,
mending uniforms,

483
00:38:37,458 --> 00:38:40,477
packing food and blankets, and...

484
00:38:40,577 --> 00:38:42,443
of course...

485
00:38:42,543 --> 00:38:45,782
pulling together medical supplies
and bandages

486
00:38:45,882 --> 00:38:48,902
for those who'll follow to help...

487
00:38:49,002 --> 00:38:51,090
if needed.

488
00:38:52,155 --> 00:38:55,196
Well, I hope you're not gonna do that.

489
00:38:55,960 --> 00:38:58,091
It's a war,

490
00:38:58,191 --> 00:38:59,936
not a party.

491
00:39:00,432 --> 00:39:02,901
Of course not. Why would I go?

492
00:39:03,001 --> 00:39:05,926
There's nothing I believe in
enough to fight for...

493
00:39:06,026 --> 00:39:10,218
- while you, on the other hand...
- Oh, yes.

494
00:39:10,318 --> 00:39:12,704
Love at first sight.

495
00:39:39,436 --> 00:39:40,796
Let's go!

496
00:39:44,975 --> 00:39:46,645
Hurry!

497
00:39:46,745 --> 00:39:48,673
Hurry!

498
00:39:50,213 --> 00:39:52,210
Fall in!

499
00:39:52,716 --> 00:39:54,746
Fall in!

500
00:39:57,521 --> 00:39:59,858
Battalion, fall in!

501
00:40:00,358 --> 00:40:03,187
Order! Arms!

502
00:40:04,862 --> 00:40:06,431
Eyes front!

503
00:40:06,531 --> 00:40:11,904
Battalion of cadets,
Virginia Military Institute!

504
00:40:12,004 --> 00:40:16,058
Forward, march!

505
00:41:15,539 --> 00:41:18,370
Why is the answer no
insufficient for you?

506
00:41:18,470 --> 00:41:20,122
General, with all respect...

507
00:41:20,222 --> 00:41:24,709
There is no respect, not in your face,
your voice, your words!

508
00:41:25,009 --> 00:41:27,045
There is no respect in you.

509
00:41:27,145 --> 00:41:32,010
When I'm comfortable,
then I will advance.

510
00:41:32,251 --> 00:41:36,387
Sir, if we do not reach New Market Gap

511
00:41:36,487 --> 00:41:40,333
before Breckinridge gathers his troops,

512
00:41:40,433 --> 00:41:41,960
it will be too late.

513
00:41:42,060 --> 00:41:45,930
If I advance before I'm comfortable...

514
00:41:46,230 --> 00:41:47,932
that will be too early.

515
00:41:48,032 --> 00:41:50,902
And early comes before late.

516
00:41:52,098 --> 00:41:55,107
Why would he do that, Sigel?
Just sit there?

517
00:41:55,207 --> 00:41:57,976
Oh, I'm sure it's a whole
bunch of reasons,

518
00:41:58,076 --> 00:42:00,645
cowardice near the top.

519
00:42:01,045 --> 00:42:02,947
And with General Wharton on the train...

520
00:42:03,047 --> 00:42:05,850
Yes, things would appear
to be going better, Charlie.

521
00:42:05,950 --> 00:42:07,619
Observe my elation.

522
00:42:07,719 --> 00:42:10,452
- You won't have to use the boys.
- No.

523
00:42:10,552 --> 00:42:13,458
- They still on the way?
- Yes, sir.

524
00:42:13,558 --> 00:42:15,226
Attention, cadets!

525
00:42:15,326 --> 00:42:19,431
The young ladies of Staunton have
invited you to a welcoming social tonight!

526
00:42:19,531 --> 00:42:24,744
- Look sharp, boys!
- If you insist, sir. Orders are orders.

527
00:42:53,330 --> 00:42:57,502
Sorry, boy.
Down to just bread and dried beef.

528
00:42:57,602 --> 00:42:59,630
Thank you very much.

529
00:43:09,546 --> 00:43:11,883
You think there's gonna be
a lot of ladies at this dance?

530
00:43:12,283 --> 00:43:15,653
I hope there's more than one.
Otherwise, you boys are out of luck.

531
00:43:15,853 --> 00:43:18,834
I know I'll be looking
for one in particular.

532
00:43:19,548 --> 00:43:22,527
Do you think Captain Chinook
will let us rats go tonight?

533
00:43:22,627 --> 00:43:26,331
My goodness, I forgot to ask him
in our last intimate chat.

534
00:43:26,864 --> 00:43:31,069
Sorry, I won't be able to make it.
Got guard duty.

535
00:43:31,169 --> 00:43:34,406
Looks like I'll be dancing
with old Chinook instead.

536
00:43:34,506 --> 00:43:37,041
Oh, I hear old Chinook's known
for his waltzing abilities.

537
00:43:37,141 --> 00:43:39,244
You could do far worse
than Captain Chinook.

538
00:43:39,344 --> 00:43:42,280
Be careful, Johnny. He might
just sweep you right off your feet.

539
00:43:42,380 --> 00:43:44,949
Well, now, that's making me
mighty uncomfortable.

540
00:43:45,914 --> 00:43:47,752
- Hey, rat.
- You want to splash a little?

541
00:43:47,852 --> 00:43:52,316
Rat! Come on now! I'm in the middle
of shaving. I just did my hair!

542
00:43:55,475 --> 00:43:59,208
<i>I gotta move and get some food
I never meant to stay...</i>

543
00:44:30,293 --> 00:44:34,532
Is it all right that I don't have
a uniform like you do?

544
00:44:34,932 --> 00:44:39,337
Not to worry, Robert. One day,
you will be magnificent, remember?

545
00:44:39,437 --> 00:44:43,007
When you're an upperclassman,
you will have a coat just like this one.

546
00:44:43,107 --> 00:44:45,677
But for tonight, you're perfect.

547
00:44:45,777 --> 00:44:48,429
Now let's find you a lady.
Excuse me, miss.

548
00:44:48,529 --> 00:44:51,609
I'd like you to meet
a real Southern gentleman.

549
00:44:52,315 --> 00:44:54,219
Hi. I'm Robert.

550
00:44:54,319 --> 00:44:56,754
- Kara.
- Go enjoy yourselves.

551
00:44:56,854 --> 00:44:58,716
Go on.

552
00:45:04,745 --> 00:45:08,950
Well, welcome, soldier.
Can I persuade you to a dance?

553
00:45:10,431 --> 00:45:12,106
No. No, thank you.

554
00:45:12,206 --> 00:45:15,890
- I knew I should have worn the red dress.
- Miss, you are lovely in that dress,

555
00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:18,747
and whoever dances with you
is gonna be the envy of all.

556
00:45:19,277 --> 00:45:22,280
- The hair, then? I can take it down.
- Please, don't trouble yourself.

557
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:25,416
This is about a girl
I left behind in Lexington.

558
00:45:26,017 --> 00:45:27,919
Married, are you?

559
00:45:28,019 --> 00:45:31,472
Not yet. Childhood sweethearts.

560
00:45:31,572 --> 00:45:34,399
Been together as long as...

561
00:45:34,499 --> 00:45:36,090
long as I can remember.

562
00:45:37,461 --> 00:45:41,032
I just came here tonight
for the refreshments and music.

563
00:45:41,432 --> 00:45:44,735
Do you know if all the other ladies
have arrived already?

564
00:45:44,835 --> 00:45:47,299
I'm sure I wouldn't know.

565
00:45:47,399 --> 00:45:50,935
All right, of course. Evening.

566
00:46:43,293 --> 00:46:45,757
Would you just excuse me a moment?

567
00:46:57,607 --> 00:47:00,504
I hope I'm not interrupting anything.

568
00:47:02,046 --> 00:47:04,348
I told you not to come.

569
00:47:04,448 --> 00:47:07,044
Yes, you did.

570
00:47:10,287 --> 00:47:12,924
- Tomorrow...
- I know where you're going...

571
00:47:13,024 --> 00:47:16,527
to New Market. I'm going, too.

572
00:47:16,627 --> 00:47:19,057
You haven't seen the last of me.

573
00:47:24,901 --> 00:47:27,558
Still not much at conversation.

574
00:47:29,239 --> 00:47:31,275
Or anything else.

575
00:47:31,375 --> 00:47:33,905
I'll be the judge of that.

576
00:47:41,835 --> 00:47:44,104
You are absolutely right.

577
00:47:44,204 --> 00:47:45,517
Oh, Miss...

578
00:47:47,540 --> 00:47:50,951
No way to talk to a soldier
on the eve of battle.

579
00:48:04,574 --> 00:48:07,071
You'll be fine.

580
00:48:07,628 --> 00:48:09,723
That's the plan.

581
00:48:17,821 --> 00:48:19,884
For good luck.

582
00:48:35,838 --> 00:48:38,669
So you won't forget me.

583
00:48:40,643 --> 00:48:44,420
No, Sam, this is the plan.

584
00:48:44,520 --> 00:48:47,352
A farm, a shop, a trade.

585
00:48:47,452 --> 00:48:49,513
Your choice.

586
00:48:49,886 --> 00:48:52,651
Four babies, my choice.

587
00:48:54,558 --> 00:48:56,654
That'd be all?

588
00:48:57,595 --> 00:49:00,031
We'll fight a good deal.

589
00:49:00,131 --> 00:49:01,933
We will, will we?

590
00:49:02,033 --> 00:49:05,903
I'm sure of that, even when
we're old on a porch together

591
00:49:06,003 --> 00:49:09,040
with nine grandchildren
and our teeth falling out.

592
00:49:09,140 --> 00:49:12,110
Well, we'll laugh some, too, I believe.

593
00:49:12,810 --> 00:49:15,606
And there will be conversation.

594
00:49:23,119 --> 00:49:25,683
I do like conversation.

595
00:49:31,327 --> 00:49:35,903
- You missed a good party.
- Cadet Wise, I'm here to relieve you.

596
00:49:38,368 --> 00:49:41,818
If you ask me, something big is coming.

597
00:49:42,673 --> 00:49:46,410
Only one day's march from New Market.
By Saturday night...

598
00:49:46,510 --> 00:49:48,412
the battle will begin the next day.

599
00:49:48,512 --> 00:49:50,948
You and Breckinridge figure it all out?

600
00:49:51,048 --> 00:49:53,518
Well, I have it
from Grant himself, actually.

601
00:49:54,418 --> 00:49:57,254
We shared a whiskey, foul cigar.

602
00:49:57,354 --> 00:50:01,425
He said let's end
this whole bloodstained mess...

603
00:50:01,525 --> 00:50:05,070
Sunday at New Market Gap.

604
00:50:05,796 --> 00:50:08,399
I'm sure of it, actually.

605
00:50:08,499 --> 00:50:10,728
It's an omen.

606
00:50:12,719 --> 00:50:14,505
How?

607
00:50:14,605 --> 00:50:18,035
Stonewall Jackson
always fought on a Sunday.

608
00:50:20,577 --> 00:50:23,040
I'm worried about you, John.

609
00:50:23,546 --> 00:50:26,483
If you don't believe
in what you're fighting for...

610
00:50:26,583 --> 00:50:28,486
you won't make it out of this valley.

611
00:50:28,586 --> 00:50:32,206
A man must believe his cause is just
in order to gladly die for it.

612
00:50:32,306 --> 00:50:34,375
Defending our homeland
against strangers?

613
00:50:35,219 --> 00:50:37,415
You know I come
from a family of bankers.

614
00:50:37,515 --> 00:50:39,981
We don't own slaves.

615
00:50:40,731 --> 00:50:45,211
But the South's way of life's depended
on slaves for over 200 years.

616
00:50:46,769 --> 00:50:50,842
You rip it to pieces all at once,
and you destroy the rest of us.

617
00:50:50,942 --> 00:50:54,611
We should not be fighting
to keep people in chains.

618
00:50:57,647 --> 00:51:01,953
Will you or will you not
defend Virginia?

619
00:51:02,253 --> 00:51:04,793
I will defend my family.

620
00:51:05,688 --> 00:51:08,125
My friends are my family.

621
00:51:08,225 --> 00:51:11,722
This school is my family.
I will fight for that.

622
00:51:13,129 --> 00:51:16,654
But if God grants us victory,
we must change.

623
00:51:24,674 --> 00:51:27,011
Keep your thoughts to yourself, John.

624
00:51:27,311 --> 00:51:30,815
The others, they...
they may doubt your resolve.

625
00:51:31,914 --> 00:51:34,272
They would be fools if they did.

626
00:51:49,966 --> 00:51:53,604
Sir, Union Cavalry in force

627
00:51:53,704 --> 00:51:58,002
approaching from the east
just on the other side of that hill.

628
00:51:58,909 --> 00:52:01,472
So it is to be tomorrow.

629
00:52:03,012 --> 00:52:04,942
Finally.

630
00:52:06,049 --> 00:52:08,920
- We'll have Wharton?
- Almost certainly.

631
00:52:09,320 --> 00:52:12,540
Goddamn it, Major!
Can you not speak plain English?

632
00:52:12,640 --> 00:52:15,260
Is that half certain?
Is that more than certain?

633
00:52:15,360 --> 00:52:17,821
At least half.

634
00:52:18,094 --> 00:52:21,332
We will win tomorrow, sir,
because we have to.

635
00:52:21,432 --> 00:52:23,341
- I didn't hear that, Charlie.
- I said...

636
00:52:23,441 --> 00:52:27,501
I do not want to hear the language
of losers from you, Charlie.

637
00:52:29,906 --> 00:52:33,077
Victory will not come
because we think it must.

638
00:52:33,177 --> 00:52:36,407
Well, then, what is the language
of the winners, sir?

639
00:52:38,481 --> 00:52:42,052
I will lose, and I will die,

640
00:52:42,152 --> 00:52:46,123
and I will fail everything
and everyone that I love

641
00:52:46,223 --> 00:52:49,924
unless I find the way to win.

642
00:52:53,329 --> 00:52:55,850
The Confederates
cannot sustain the losses.

643
00:52:55,950 --> 00:52:57,868
Is that what Grant says?

644
00:52:57,968 --> 00:53:00,171
The general doesn't speak
in predictions.

645
00:53:00,271 --> 00:53:01,999
Nor in boasts.

646
00:53:02,506 --> 00:53:05,476
What news does he give
of the Valley campaign?

647
00:53:05,576 --> 00:53:09,280
We're better fed, better supplied,

648
00:53:09,380 --> 00:53:11,749
more experienced.

649
00:53:12,349 --> 00:53:14,070
The report is...

650
00:53:14,170 --> 00:53:18,226
that Breckinridge has actually
conscripted schoolboys,

651
00:53:18,626 --> 00:53:21,725
cadets from the Virginia
Military Institute,

652
00:53:21,825 --> 00:53:24,829
he's so desperately shorthanded.

653
00:53:24,929 --> 00:53:28,999
So we've stooped
to massacring schoolboys?

654
00:53:29,499 --> 00:53:32,796
Only if he chooses to use them, sir.

655
00:53:36,073 --> 00:53:38,109
Help me, please! Somebody!

656
00:53:38,209 --> 00:53:41,479
Please, sir, can you spare a moment?
Can you help us, sir?

657
00:53:41,579 --> 00:53:44,048
- My sister's hurt.
- Get away from me.

658
00:53:44,148 --> 00:53:46,918
- Her leg is... Please.
- Somebody help me!

659
00:53:47,018 --> 00:53:50,388
- Somebody help us.
- Help me!

660
00:53:50,588 --> 00:53:54,291
- Please! Help me!
- Mister.

661
00:53:54,391 --> 00:53:57,399
Anyone asks, I'll be right back.
Keep marching!

662
00:54:00,462 --> 00:54:02,746
Please, sir, help us.

663
00:54:02,846 --> 00:54:05,236
- We're gonna get you out of here!
- Please, help me!

664
00:54:05,336 --> 00:54:07,105
- Go to the other side.
- Help me!

665
00:54:07,205 --> 00:54:08,873
Moses, let's go.

666
00:54:08,973 --> 00:54:10,463
I got it.

667
00:54:11,442 --> 00:54:13,338
Ready, come on.

668
00:54:17,680 --> 00:54:20,911
- Help me!
- Come on, Moses!

669
00:54:21,318 --> 00:54:25,183
- Think it's stuck on something.
- It's gonna be okay.

670
00:54:26,289 --> 00:54:28,826
- Are you okay, Miss?
- What are you doing here?

671
00:54:28,926 --> 00:54:31,095
- Don't break rank!
- But you are, sir!

672
00:54:31,195 --> 00:54:33,465
- Let him help.
- What are you doing, Jack?

673
00:54:33,565 --> 00:54:36,767
Somebody needs help, don't they?
Don't you worry. We're gonna get you out.

674
00:54:36,867 --> 00:54:39,402
Jack, take this side.
Yeah, pull her out!

675
00:54:39,502 --> 00:54:41,669
Ready? Lift!

676
00:54:51,949 --> 00:54:53,785
You okay?

677
00:54:53,925 --> 00:54:56,554
- Thank you.
- Of course.

678
00:54:57,054 --> 00:54:58,356
- You all right, darlin'?
- Okay.

679
00:54:58,556 --> 00:55:01,826
- Don't you worry. We gonna send help.
- All right.

680
00:55:02,526 --> 00:55:06,294
You're gonna be okay now. I promise.

681
00:55:06,394 --> 00:55:09,800
All right, boys!
We got a battle to fight, remember?

682
00:55:09,900 --> 00:55:12,169
- Let's kill some Blues!
- Let's go.

683
00:55:12,269 --> 00:55:15,137
Thank God! Thought you had
a sudden attack of humanity.

684
00:55:16,807 --> 00:55:19,422
It's gonna be all right.

685
00:55:27,183 --> 00:55:30,854
- Stand easy, men.
- Do you have time for this?

686
00:55:30,954 --> 00:55:33,811
If I might be asking them to lay down
their lives in the morning,

687
00:55:34,291 --> 00:55:36,360
then I can surely make time.

688
00:55:36,560 --> 00:55:38,262
- Oh, right.
- Cut your toe off.

689
00:55:38,362 --> 00:55:40,122
Bet you you cut your toe off.

690
00:55:41,498 --> 00:55:43,767
I'll grow it back.

691
00:55:52,175 --> 00:55:54,145
Gentlemen.

692
00:55:54,845 --> 00:55:56,382
John C. Breckinridge.

693
00:55:57,028 --> 00:56:00,284
- John Wise, sir.
- Governor Wise's son?

694
00:56:00,384 --> 00:56:04,447
- Yes, sir.
- I did not know you were out here.

695
00:56:05,221 --> 00:56:08,876
I have the privilege of knowing your
daddy. He is an extraordinary man...

696
00:56:09,661 --> 00:56:12,129
and a very able general.

697
00:56:12,229 --> 00:56:15,793
I'll send him a wire.
You have a message for him?

698
00:56:17,233 --> 00:56:19,391
That I love him.

699
00:56:19,491 --> 00:56:21,697
'Course you do.

700
00:56:23,472 --> 00:56:27,704
All right, stand easy.
Sit down. Sit down.

701
00:56:34,550 --> 00:56:36,234
Well...

702
00:56:36,334 --> 00:56:40,124
purpose of this little visit
is because it's my fault you're here.

703
00:56:40,724 --> 00:56:44,128
In many ways, it's my fault that
everyone is here in this valley,

704
00:56:45,228 --> 00:56:49,133
'cause when I was Vice President,
I tried to solve this problem, and I...

705
00:56:49,233 --> 00:56:51,168
I could not.

706
00:56:51,368 --> 00:56:54,938
And now good men
of the North and the South...

707
00:56:55,938 --> 00:56:58,175
will die here,

708
00:56:58,853 --> 00:57:02,894
and I will have some difficult decisions
tomorrow, some of which...

709
00:57:02,994 --> 00:57:05,142
may involve you.

710
00:57:05,715 --> 00:57:09,653
So I'd like to know
what you think of the war,

711
00:57:10,153 --> 00:57:12,950
what your plans are for afterwards.

712
00:57:14,089 --> 00:57:15,158
Young man?

713
00:57:15,258 --> 00:57:19,162
We find ourselves invaded
by a conquering army

714
00:57:19,262 --> 00:57:22,666
whom I must consider foreign invaders.

715
00:57:23,266 --> 00:57:27,014
Defending our homeland is an imperative,
and I can't understand anyone

716
00:57:27,114 --> 00:57:29,423
who thinks otherwise.

717
00:57:30,073 --> 00:57:33,043
- Who might you be, sir?
- I'm Thomas Garland Jefferson, sir.

718
00:57:33,343 --> 00:57:36,173
- Are you, indeed?
- Yes, sir.

719
00:57:36,979 --> 00:57:40,951
Well, my family's owned a plantation
for close to 150 years,

720
00:57:41,351 --> 00:57:44,640
so I'm defending my heritage
and my future,

721
00:57:45,988 --> 00:57:47,925
but that ain't the whole of it.

722
00:57:48,225 --> 00:57:51,228
I believe folks of a certain class

723
00:57:51,328 --> 00:57:53,964
have a heavy responsibility.

724
00:57:54,064 --> 00:57:58,068
We must use our position to see that
the common folk among us are cared for.

725
00:57:58,168 --> 00:58:02,239
Well, we common folks
surely do appreciate that.

726
00:58:02,339 --> 00:58:05,976
- I meant no offense, sir.
- None taken.

727
00:58:06,076 --> 00:58:09,239
Your good heart
does you credit, soldier.

728
00:58:10,313 --> 00:58:13,551
Who's next? Young man?

729
00:58:13,851 --> 00:58:16,854
I think war is stupid and cruel...

730
00:58:18,054 --> 00:58:20,562
and nowhere near as necessary as...

731
00:58:20,662 --> 00:58:23,894
those leading the fighting
like to tell themselves.

732
00:58:23,994 --> 00:58:25,956
I see.

733
00:58:27,296 --> 00:58:30,968
And do you think I could negotiate
our way out of this thing tomorrow?

734
00:58:31,068 --> 00:58:34,931
No, sir, not any more.

735
00:58:38,174 --> 00:58:41,287
We will stand with you and fight.

736
00:58:43,012 --> 00:58:45,282
And what of your future?

737
00:58:45,382 --> 00:58:50,006
All I know I really want
is to find the right woman,

738
00:58:50,453 --> 00:58:52,927
settle down...

739
00:58:53,027 --> 00:58:55,559
provide somehow for her
and our children.

740
00:58:55,659 --> 00:58:58,409
That sounds like a good plan.

741
00:58:58,512 --> 00:59:01,287
I will fight Grant's bullies, sir.

742
00:59:01,748 --> 00:59:03,634
I thank you.

743
00:59:03,734 --> 00:59:05,899
I tell everybody...

744
00:59:05,999 --> 00:59:08,604
I'm going to be a farmer,

745
00:59:09,105 --> 00:59:13,364
but if Mr. Wise would let me,
I'd like to help him be governor.

746
00:59:13,464 --> 00:59:15,505
Is that so?

747
00:59:20,749 --> 00:59:23,053
You seem very quiet, young man.

748
00:59:23,153 --> 00:59:26,090
My family and my home were burned.

749
00:59:26,840 --> 00:59:30,978
I'll kill as many Blues tomorrow
as God permits, sir.

750
00:59:31,428 --> 00:59:33,568
Young man,
I'm truly sorry for your loss.

751
00:59:35,765 --> 00:59:37,968
This cadet here, his name is Moses, sir.

752
00:59:38,268 --> 00:59:41,972
He's a genius artist.
You should see his portraits.

753
00:59:42,572 --> 00:59:44,975
I would like to try
my hand at sculpture.

754
00:59:45,075 --> 00:59:48,645
- It's a hard way to make a living.
- Yes, sir.

755
00:59:48,745 --> 00:59:51,832
Look, I know that you must be afraid,

756
00:59:51,932 --> 00:59:54,117
and I know because I'm afraid.

757
00:59:54,217 --> 00:59:58,739
We all are, but we must all
take strength from your teacher,

758
00:59:58,839 --> 01:00:00,957
Stonewall Jackson.

759
01:00:01,057 --> 01:00:04,461
Do not take counsel of your fears,

760
01:00:04,561 --> 01:00:09,337
to which I would add,
do not let anger ruin your lives.

761
01:00:09,437 --> 01:00:11,393
This war...

762
01:00:11,493 --> 01:00:15,006
will end, I swear to you,

763
01:00:15,326 --> 01:00:17,374
and you boys...

764
01:00:18,474 --> 01:00:21,287
you're the future of this country.

765
01:00:21,578 --> 01:00:23,749
And having met you,

766
01:00:23,849 --> 01:00:26,438
the future is bright.

767
01:00:26,650 --> 01:00:30,854
So you all sleep well,
and God bless you tomorrow.

768
01:00:31,954 --> 01:00:34,551
God bless all of us.

769
01:00:42,765 --> 01:00:45,269
- Duck, gather the boys.
- Yes, sir.

770
01:00:45,369 --> 01:00:47,538
Company, at attention!

771
01:00:47,638 --> 01:00:49,866
Fall in on me!

772
01:00:50,206 --> 01:00:52,913
Don't make me say it again. I'm tired!

773
01:00:56,612 --> 01:00:59,068
Bow your heads, gentlemen.

774
01:01:00,236 --> 01:01:01,582
Heavenly Father...

775
01:01:01,952 --> 01:01:05,723
this morning, we march into the valley
of death as brothers in arms.

776
01:01:05,823 --> 01:01:07,825
Help us to be strong.

777
01:01:07,925 --> 01:01:09,599
Help us to do our duty...

778
01:01:09,699 --> 01:01:12,863
for our mothers, for our fathers,

779
01:01:12,963 --> 01:01:15,599
for our sisters and for our brothers,

780
01:01:15,699 --> 01:01:18,139
wherever they may be.

781
01:01:18,239 --> 01:01:21,280
- Amen.
- Amen.

782
01:01:23,072 --> 01:01:25,869
Form 'em up, and move 'em out.

783
01:01:27,410 --> 01:01:29,461
Company...

784
01:01:29,561 --> 01:01:32,256
fall in on me!

785
01:01:37,219 --> 01:01:39,423
Left! Left!

786
01:01:39,523 --> 01:01:41,352
Left, right, left!

787
01:01:42,392 --> 01:01:43,927
Looky here!

788
01:01:44,027 --> 01:01:47,530
You boys are babes in arms we got!

789
01:01:49,267 --> 01:01:53,195
You little boys want
a sugar rag to suck on?

790
01:01:53,895 --> 01:01:58,368
Hey, does your mommy know
you snuck out so early in the morning?

791
01:02:03,112 --> 01:02:06,836
Poor little boys, little old boys!

792
01:02:09,619 --> 01:02:11,715
Poor boys.

793
01:02:46,889 --> 01:02:49,918
- Confederate infantry already?
- Sir, General Breckinridge just arrived

794
01:02:50,018 --> 01:02:53,997
with the units of the Virginia Cavalry forming
just south of the village of New Market.

795
01:02:54,097 --> 01:02:57,968
Bring the 34th Massachusetts forward,
back from their defensive positions.

796
01:02:58,068 --> 01:03:01,698
Get the cavalry to go east
toward that mountain!

797
01:03:09,245 --> 01:03:11,481
Where is Echols?

798
01:03:11,781 --> 01:03:14,384
- He's getting into position.
- Calvary probes?

799
01:03:14,484 --> 01:03:16,553
- Already commenced.
- Reserve units?

800
01:03:16,653 --> 01:03:19,222
All in position, including the cadets.

801
01:03:19,322 --> 01:03:21,992
I want those boys at the very rear.

802
01:03:22,092 --> 01:03:25,027
You understand me?
And I want 'em protected.

803
01:03:25,127 --> 01:03:27,290
Of course they are.

804
01:03:48,150 --> 01:03:50,814
Everybody ready? Fire!

805
01:03:53,755 --> 01:03:56,827
Wake up the Yankees. Time for breakfast.

806
01:03:56,927 --> 01:03:58,455
Fire!

807
01:04:02,832 --> 01:04:04,909
Forward!

808
01:04:07,503 --> 01:04:09,694
Lay down your colors, Virginia!

809
01:04:09,794 --> 01:04:12,536
Slow down! Six paces behind the colors!

810
01:04:20,483 --> 01:04:22,886
Battalion...

811
01:04:22,986 --> 01:04:24,288
- halt!
- Halt!

812
01:04:24,388 --> 01:04:26,889
Drop excess gear...

813
01:04:27,014 --> 01:04:28,992
and prepare to march!

814
01:04:29,092 --> 01:04:31,488
Drop gear!

815
01:04:32,561 --> 01:04:35,158
And prepare to move out!

816
01:04:40,002 --> 01:04:41,615
Put that on the ground.

817
01:04:44,007 --> 01:04:47,110
Captain! Captain, shall we advance?

818
01:04:47,210 --> 01:04:50,013
No. He wants us to commit.
We will not take the bait!

819
01:04:50,113 --> 01:04:53,433
Send this to Sigel!
Facing large combined rebel force!

820
01:04:53,533 --> 01:04:55,529
Immediate reinforcements required!

821
01:04:58,720 --> 01:05:00,608
Commence fire!

822
01:05:12,701 --> 01:05:16,640
Wharton's brigade is in position on the west
side, commanding from the hills to the Pike.

823
01:05:16,740 --> 01:05:18,503
I can see that,

824
01:05:18,603 --> 01:05:20,609
but I do not see Echols.

825
01:05:20,709 --> 01:05:24,214
He has arrived, sir. He's filling in
on the east side of the Pike as we speak.

826
01:05:24,514 --> 01:05:26,610
Commence fire!

827
01:05:47,703 --> 01:05:50,400
Libby! Help me, please!

828
01:05:54,077 --> 01:05:58,615
No matter how many bandages,
there will never be enough.

829
01:05:58,815 --> 01:06:01,485
Colonel Wharton, you move your brigade

830
01:06:01,585 --> 01:06:05,121
from your current position
down the hill at best speed

831
01:06:05,221 --> 01:06:08,458
into that depression
below the Union artillery.

832
01:06:08,758 --> 01:06:11,028
- You'll be protected there. You see it?
- Yeah.

833
01:06:11,128 --> 01:06:14,776
And take the reserve with you.
The cadets will be in last position.

834
01:06:14,876 --> 01:06:18,094
Under no circumstances can they engage.

835
01:06:23,638 --> 01:06:27,010
Send orders to the reserves
to conform their movements with mine.

836
01:06:27,210 --> 01:06:29,046
Men, move out!

837
01:06:29,146 --> 01:06:31,282
Drop in!

838
01:06:31,382 --> 01:06:33,077
Drop in!

839
01:06:37,118 --> 01:06:39,656
Gentlemen, as soon as we go
over the crest of this hill,

840
01:06:39,756 --> 01:06:43,526
I want you to drive your men
straight down into the valley.

841
01:06:43,626 --> 01:06:47,391
You run like hell. Go! Go!

842
01:06:48,019 --> 01:06:50,000
- Company...
- Forward!

843
01:06:50,100 --> 01:06:53,142
- Forward!
- March.

844
01:07:13,288 --> 01:07:15,918
Hit the front side of that hill!

845
01:07:37,980 --> 01:07:40,510
They can't reach us here!

846
01:07:41,049 --> 01:07:43,089
Where the hell are the reserves?

847
01:07:50,092 --> 01:07:54,131
My order was for them
to conform from my moves!

848
01:07:54,231 --> 01:07:56,326
One piece of luck.

849
01:07:59,468 --> 01:08:03,664
Load shells! 2,000 yards!
Give 'em everything you've got!

850
01:08:05,040 --> 01:08:07,949
Fire! Fire!

851
01:08:10,946 --> 01:08:12,842
Run!

852
01:08:13,782 --> 01:08:15,879
This is not a parade!

853
01:08:20,189 --> 01:08:23,719
My God, they're holding formations.

854
01:08:28,831 --> 01:08:30,667
March!

855
01:08:33,303 --> 01:08:36,065
Close up, battalion!

856
01:08:41,009 --> 01:08:43,507
Forward, march!

857
01:08:51,520 --> 01:08:53,624
Forward, march!

858
01:08:53,924 --> 01:08:56,253
Mark time, battalion!

859
01:09:00,229 --> 01:09:04,204
- I'll be damned.
- If I didn't see it with my own eyes...

860
01:09:09,488 --> 01:09:12,492
- We're losing 'em behind the house!
- Aren't they trapped there now, sir?

861
01:09:12,592 --> 01:09:15,712
- Only till they decide to charge.
- But we're vulnerable here, Captain!

862
01:09:15,812 --> 01:09:18,665
We defend this hill
for as long as we can!

863
01:09:18,765 --> 01:09:21,108
And halt!

864
01:09:21,951 --> 01:09:25,254
Did y'all see that?
Even the rats held up under fire.

865
01:09:25,354 --> 01:09:29,659
We showed those old boys, didn't we?
Sugar rag, is it?

866
01:09:30,259 --> 01:09:34,958
I can't believe it.
You two actually smiled at each other.

867
01:09:36,065 --> 01:09:38,902
Get ready! He'll be coming
to us Bushong's farm!

868
01:09:39,002 --> 01:09:40,849
We'll give him an Ohio hello!

869
01:09:42,905 --> 01:09:47,577
Follow me, but keep at least
300 yards back, well to the rear!

870
01:09:48,077 --> 01:09:50,313
- Do you understand, Captain?
- Yes, sir!

871
01:09:50,613 --> 01:09:53,818
Virginians... forward!

872
01:09:53,918 --> 01:09:55,370
Come on, boys!

873
01:09:55,470 --> 01:09:57,420
Come on. Come on, boys!

874
01:09:58,388 --> 01:10:00,130
Battalion...

875
01:10:00,230 --> 01:10:02,788
prepare to advance!

876
01:10:10,398 --> 01:10:14,070
First and second rank, ready!

877
01:10:14,970 --> 01:10:17,307
Steady! Steady!

878
01:10:17,407 --> 01:10:20,100
Wait for my command!

879
01:10:20,443 --> 01:10:22,811
Fire! Fire!

880
01:10:37,626 --> 01:10:40,597
God bless those Pennsylvania boys.
Holding fast!

881
01:10:40,697 --> 01:10:42,966
Reload! Hurry up!

882
01:10:43,066 --> 01:10:45,309
Now! Now! Now! Now!

883
01:10:45,409 --> 01:10:48,694
Ready! Fire!

884
01:10:48,794 --> 01:10:51,234
Fire! Fire!

885
01:10:57,279 --> 01:11:00,109
They've torn a hole
in the center of our line!

886
01:11:01,811 --> 01:11:03,820
If we can see it, so can the Blues.

887
01:11:03,920 --> 01:11:07,323
Sir, you must put in the reserves
to restore the line.

888
01:11:08,173 --> 01:11:11,077
When the Union forces regroup and
counterattack, that line will divide in two.

889
01:11:11,227 --> 01:11:13,363
They'll pull right through
the hole in the center.

890
01:11:13,463 --> 01:11:17,175
Sir, you must put in the cadets.

891
01:11:24,273 --> 01:11:26,709
Send the boys in.

892
01:11:26,809 --> 01:11:29,212
May God forgive me.

893
01:11:29,312 --> 01:11:31,074
Sir.

894
01:11:44,059 --> 01:11:47,564
Battalion, forward to the line!

895
01:11:47,664 --> 01:11:49,065
Forward to the line!

896
01:11:49,265 --> 01:11:51,127
Come on!

897
01:11:53,402 --> 01:11:56,598
Let's go! Get to the fence!

898
01:11:58,006 --> 01:12:00,410
- To what?
- Let's go!

899
01:12:00,510 --> 01:12:02,772
Get to the fence!

900
01:12:02,978 --> 01:12:05,208
Get to the fence!

901
01:12:11,751 --> 01:12:13,777
Fire at will!

902
01:12:13,877 --> 01:12:16,152
Fire at will!

903
01:12:18,427 --> 01:12:21,031
The cadets are filling the gap.

904
01:12:21,331 --> 01:12:23,493
Fire!

905
01:12:26,201 --> 01:12:27,997
Fire!

906
01:12:28,953 --> 01:12:31,034
Keep shooting, boys!

907
01:12:35,844 --> 01:12:38,711
- Johnny!
- I'm right here, Moses!

908
01:12:42,184 --> 01:12:44,024
Fire! Fire!

909
01:12:46,788 --> 01:12:48,925
We can't stay here!

910
01:12:50,018 --> 01:12:52,122
Must be somewheres a little more useful.

911
01:12:53,428 --> 01:12:57,201
Gentlemen, what do you say
we charge those guns?

912
01:12:57,301 --> 01:13:00,804
I don't know, gentlemen,
I bet that sounds a bit dangerous.

913
01:13:00,904 --> 01:13:04,834
John Wise, that was what I was
suggesting. I was just being subtle.

914
01:13:05,474 --> 01:13:08,472
No sense in dying if we can't
figure out who takes the credit, right?

915
01:13:11,680 --> 01:13:15,218
- Sir, battalion is ready to attack!
- We don't have further orders!

916
01:13:15,318 --> 01:13:17,187
No, I don't suspect
we'll get further orders!

917
01:13:17,287 --> 01:13:19,055
The cadets are ready to charge, sir!

918
01:13:19,155 --> 01:13:23,040
I suggest we attack and take those guns
before we get blown apart!

919
01:13:29,497 --> 01:13:32,804
- Fix bayonets!
- Fix bayonets!

920
01:14:20,015 --> 01:14:21,545
Fire!

921
01:14:27,889 --> 01:14:30,186
Go get 'em, boys.

922
01:14:46,742 --> 01:14:49,412
What're you waiting for? Face front!

923
01:14:49,512 --> 01:14:53,137
Charge! Charge!

924
01:16:29,610 --> 01:16:32,408
But they're just a bunch
of damn schoolboys. Kill 'em!

925
01:16:37,698 --> 01:16:39,781
Kill 'em all!

926
01:16:43,492 --> 01:16:44,894
Jack!

927
01:16:45,632 --> 01:16:47,489
Jack!

928
01:16:50,115 --> 01:16:52,900
We showed them, didn't we, George?

929
01:16:55,488 --> 01:16:57,008
Jack, stay with me!

930
01:17:00,676 --> 01:17:04,105
You can't die.
I still gotta whup you good.

931
01:17:07,415 --> 01:17:10,486
I can't carry you forever, Johnny.

932
01:17:11,208 --> 01:17:12,958
It's up to you now.

933
01:17:13,058 --> 01:17:17,153
Come on, Jack! Jack, come on!

934
01:17:24,099 --> 01:17:26,463
Jack!

935
01:17:50,759 --> 01:17:53,923
Retreat now! Now! Run!

936
01:18:01,769 --> 01:18:05,741
Let's go, gentlemen! Someone's gotta
cover this godforsaken retreat!

937
01:18:05,841 --> 01:18:07,677
Let's go!

938
01:19:01,462 --> 01:19:05,361
My God, sir, the cadets
have taken Bushong Hill.

939
01:19:09,571 --> 01:19:14,364
Must be an illusion, Charlie.
Their general told them not to fight.

940
01:19:48,176 --> 01:19:50,246
Where's Jack?

941
01:19:50,805 --> 01:19:54,316
He's dead. Torn to pieces
during the final charge.

942
01:19:54,416 --> 01:19:56,278
And Johnny?

943
01:19:57,052 --> 01:19:59,348
A shell exploded.

944
01:20:17,439 --> 01:20:19,308
Johnny?

945
01:20:19,408 --> 01:20:21,305
Johnny?

946
01:20:21,405 --> 01:20:23,079
Johnny.

947
01:20:23,179 --> 01:20:25,147
Come on.

948
01:20:25,247 --> 01:20:29,551
Here you are. Here you are.
Hey, hey, hey! You come over here!

949
01:20:29,651 --> 01:20:32,422
Give me a stretcher! Come on.

950
01:20:32,722 --> 01:20:36,153
Come on. You'll be all right.

951
01:20:40,261 --> 01:20:42,291
Oh, God.

952
01:20:56,077 --> 01:20:58,373
Johnny, you hear me?

953
01:20:59,180 --> 01:21:01,617
Here you go. Here you go.

954
01:21:01,717 --> 01:21:05,021
You hear me? Hear me, Johnny?

955
01:21:06,221 --> 01:21:08,350
There you go.

956
01:21:10,726 --> 01:21:13,028
There you go. Johnny.

957
01:21:14,396 --> 01:21:17,200
Johnny. Can you hear me?

958
01:21:17,300 --> 01:21:18,713
Johnny.

959
01:21:20,168 --> 01:21:23,773
Hey, we won the battle...

960
01:21:23,873 --> 01:21:25,807
all of us.

961
01:21:25,907 --> 01:21:28,862
People are gonna call us heroes now.

962
01:21:30,531 --> 01:21:32,848
They're the heroes...

963
01:21:33,148 --> 01:21:35,143
Jack...

964
01:21:35,616 --> 01:21:36,970
all of them.

965
01:22:00,674 --> 01:22:02,539
Here.

966
01:22:04,479 --> 01:22:05,977
Bring them inside!

967
01:22:22,230 --> 01:22:25,001
Look at that wound.
Take that young man to the back bedroom.

968
01:22:25,101 --> 01:22:27,269
Could I speak with Libby
just for a minute?

969
01:22:27,469 --> 01:22:31,334
Oh, son, Libby's not here. She's up
at the field with the older girls.

970
01:22:38,746 --> 01:22:43,286
He's at the house. That boy,
he's wounded, but he's asking for you.

971
01:22:43,786 --> 01:22:46,194
Thank you so much.

972
01:22:47,388 --> 01:22:49,225
Will he survive?

973
01:22:49,325 --> 01:22:52,655
Bullet went through his chest
and lodged in his back.

974
01:22:55,596 --> 01:22:57,893
Is this your son?

975
01:23:00,985 --> 01:23:03,721
These are all my sons.

976
01:23:06,240 --> 01:23:07,605
Let's stitch him.

977
01:23:07,705 --> 01:23:09,912
Ma'am? Ma'am?

978
01:23:11,011 --> 01:23:13,475
Do you have a New Testament?

979
01:23:20,571 --> 01:23:24,770
This is a Christian Bible.
I understand you're Jewish?

980
01:23:25,026 --> 01:23:26,762
I'm a Jew.

981
01:23:26,862 --> 01:23:28,831
It's for my friend.

982
01:23:28,931 --> 01:23:31,300
He requested it.

983
01:23:31,400 --> 01:23:34,529
I do not believe my faith will object.

984
01:23:40,575 --> 01:23:42,637
Thank you.

985
01:24:09,370 --> 01:24:11,767
Are you all right?

986
01:24:39,766 --> 01:24:42,661
From the 14th chapter...

987
01:24:43,161 --> 01:24:45,239
of Saint John.

988
01:24:46,007 --> 01:24:48,777
"Let not your heart be troubled:

989
01:24:48,877 --> 01:24:51,046
"You believe in God,

990
01:24:51,146 --> 01:24:53,570
"believe also in me.

991
01:24:54,516 --> 01:24:58,317
"In my Father's house are many mansions:

992
01:24:58,887 --> 01:25:01,416
If it were not so..."

993
01:25:04,609 --> 01:25:07,039
"I would have told you."

994
01:25:07,929 --> 01:25:10,136
"I go to prepare a place for you."

995
01:25:10,366 --> 01:25:13,569
Would you... would you light me a candle?

996
01:25:14,369 --> 01:25:17,216
I don't want to listen in the dark.

997
01:25:42,897 --> 01:25:45,022
My, my, my.

998
01:25:45,122 --> 01:25:47,203
Find me a man who knows
how to set a fire.

999
01:25:47,303 --> 01:25:50,139
Next time we go into
that godforsaken valley,

1000
01:25:50,239 --> 01:25:52,534
we'll burn it to cinders.

1001
01:25:53,574 --> 01:25:55,211
If I can.

1002
01:25:55,311 --> 01:25:57,139
Thank you.

1003
01:25:58,913 --> 01:26:01,112
Let's leave him, gentlemen.

1004
01:26:37,218 --> 01:26:41,719
We were gonna spend the rest
of our lives... together.

1005
01:26:47,395 --> 01:26:49,431
Stand easy.

1006
01:26:49,531 --> 01:26:52,868
Mr. Wise. Mr. Colonna.

1007
01:26:53,268 --> 01:26:58,933
I am told that you cadets decided to lead
the charge of your own volition.

1008
01:26:59,440 --> 01:27:01,543
Is that so?

1009
01:27:01,643 --> 01:27:05,489
Are they not teaching you
the value of the chain of command

1010
01:27:05,589 --> 01:27:07,143
at the Institute?

1011
01:27:09,317 --> 01:27:12,889
- I am sorry, sir.
- Are you?

1012
01:27:14,489 --> 01:27:18,286
Then what in good God's name
were you thinking?

1013
01:27:22,129 --> 01:27:27,274
My father says the best thing about doing
what's right is it requires no thought...

1014
01:27:29,003 --> 01:27:32,132
- no thought at all.
- Well...

1015
01:27:34,142 --> 01:27:37,146
I guess I have to thank you...

1016
01:27:37,946 --> 01:27:39,531
for not thinking.

1017
01:27:47,955 --> 01:27:50,101
Well done, Virginians.

1018
01:27:52,860 --> 01:27:56,692
- Well done, men.
- Thank you, sir.

1019
01:30:11,165 --> 01:30:13,635
Private Stanard died
on the field of honor, sir!

1020
01:30:13,735 --> 01:30:15,871
Private Jefferson died
on the field of honor, sir!

1021
01:30:15,971 --> 01:30:18,007
Corporal Atwill died
on the field of honor, sir!

1022
01:30:18,107 --> 01:30:21,310
Sergeant Cabell! Private Crockett!
Private Hartsfield!

1023
01:30:21,710 --> 01:30:25,581
Private Haynes! Private Jefferson!
Private Jones!

1024
01:30:25,681 --> 01:30:28,150
Private McDowell! Private Stanard!

1025
01:30:28,250 --> 01:30:32,214
Private Wheelwright died
on the field of honor, sir!
