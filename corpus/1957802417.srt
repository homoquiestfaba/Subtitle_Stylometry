1
00:01:18,145 --> 00:01:20,080
I know what you're thinking.

2
00:01:20,213 --> 00:01:23,150
Pretty weird choice
for a host, huh?

3
00:01:23,283 --> 00:01:28,388
Who better than a sneaky little bad
boy rolling around town such as myself?

4
00:01:28,523 --> 00:01:30,758
Let me straight up with you.

5
00:01:30,892 --> 00:01:33,828
This is the kind of place it's going
to make you feel uncomfortable.

6
00:01:33,962 --> 00:01:36,030
I can promise you that.

7
00:01:36,163 --> 00:01:37,665
You may laugh.

8
00:01:37,932 --> 00:01:39,734
You may get offended.

9
00:01:39,867 --> 00:01:41,002
Don't worry,

10
00:01:41,134 --> 00:01:43,671
that's the whole fucking point.

11
00:01:43,805 --> 00:01:47,307
You see here we don't
believe in dreams.

12
00:01:47,441 --> 00:01:49,777
We live in nightmares.

13
00:01:50,210 --> 00:01:51,846
Still don't get it yet,

14
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:53,180
do ya?

15
00:01:54,082 --> 00:01:55,683
Speaking of not
getting it to the

16
00:01:55,817 --> 00:01:58,920
right of me is the
Thompsons residence.

17
00:01:59,053 --> 00:02:04,124
On the surface, Thompson seems like
your everyday all American young couple.

18
00:02:04,257 --> 00:02:06,894
But tonight that's
going to change.

19
00:02:07,028 --> 00:02:08,096
For tonight...

20
00:02:08,228 --> 00:02:09,731
Is game night.

21
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:26,146
Uh oh.

22
00:02:26,346 --> 00:02:29,216
Who invited these guys,
come on guys welcome in!

23
00:02:29,349 --> 00:02:30,785
Good to see you,
good to see you!

24
00:02:30,918 --> 00:02:32,787
We got wine and
stuff girls, IPA for the

25
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:34,722
big man, and we
got a bunch of chips.

26
00:02:36,724 --> 00:02:38,401
Basically used to be,
but I don't remember being.

27
00:02:38,425 --> 00:02:40,394
I don't ever and I've
seen any man.

28
00:02:40,528 --> 00:02:41,863
Well I can't do the math.

29
00:02:41,996 --> 00:02:43,931
- I can't do the trick.
- I have the magic.

30
00:03:07,789 --> 00:03:09,590
Uh oh. My turn?

31
00:03:09,724 --> 00:03:11,959
Right hand blue.
- Blue.

32
00:03:12,593 --> 00:03:15,630
Alright brace for impact guys
I'm bending over for this one, so...

33
00:03:16,898 --> 00:03:17,999
That's what she said.

34
00:03:21,268 --> 00:03:22,302
Who's she?

35
00:03:26,507 --> 00:03:28,943
That's funny.

36
00:03:30,377 --> 00:03:31,779
Who is she?

37
00:03:37,417 --> 00:03:39,286
Are you serious?

38
00:03:41,354 --> 00:03:42,724
No.

39
00:03:55,103 --> 00:03:56,537
Left hand red.

40
00:04:14,222 --> 00:04:17,424
- Goodnight guys!
- What are you talking about?

41
00:04:17,558 --> 00:04:19,594
- Have a good night.
- Thank you guys.

42
00:04:19,727 --> 00:04:21,062
Good night!
- Bye!

43
00:04:21,195 --> 00:04:24,165
Yeah great, thanks for coming.

44
00:04:24,632 --> 00:04:26,134
You OK?
- Yeah.

45
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:27,502
Okay.

46
00:04:35,877 --> 00:04:37,444
<i>That's what he said.</i>

47
00:04:39,647 --> 00:04:40,748
<i>Who is she?</i>

48
00:04:40,882 --> 00:04:43,050
<i>She.</i>

49
00:05:20,721 --> 00:05:22,690
OK, so I saw those curtains
on Way fair,

50
00:05:22,824 --> 00:05:25,593
the uhm, the space curtains.

51
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:27,195
It sounds ugly but it's not.

52
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:29,263
It's really cute

53
00:05:29,396 --> 00:05:31,208
<i>so I'm
thinking the space curtains in the</i>

54
00:05:31,232 --> 00:05:34,068
<i>bedroom and then we move
the bedroom curtains into</i>

55
00:05:34,202 --> 00:05:37,337
<i>the other rooms and nobody
ever has to see it again.</i>

56
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:38,573
<i>It's disgusting.</i>

57
00:05:38,706 --> 00:05:40,074
<i>Then we can move...</i>

58
00:05:43,711 --> 00:05:46,479
Yeah, once we do that then.

59
00:05:52,987 --> 00:05:55,957
You know what I mean?

60
00:05:57,091 --> 00:05:59,193
Anyway, yeah, so I think
you could do that...

61
00:06:28,522 --> 00:06:30,691
Who is she?

62
00:06:58,686 --> 00:07:00,721
Hey honey.

63
00:07:00,855 --> 00:07:01,889
Uhm...

64
00:07:02,455 --> 00:07:04,692
What's going on here?

65
00:07:07,595 --> 00:07:12,767
OK, because you know it's one
thing if you can't do the dishes,

66
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:18,438
but it looks like you're
peeing in jars so...

67
00:07:20,875 --> 00:07:22,109
Dishes...

68
00:07:23,177 --> 00:07:24,477
Oh, the dishes...

69
00:07:24,612 --> 00:07:26,547
Yeah, the dishes.

70
00:07:27,048 --> 00:07:28,816
It's what I said.

71
00:07:32,153 --> 00:07:33,187
What?

72
00:07:33,654 --> 00:07:36,456
Did you shit on the fridge?

73
00:07:39,694 --> 00:07:41,829
That's what you said.

74
00:07:45,166 --> 00:07:46,834
Excuse me.

75
00:07:47,501 --> 00:07:48,936
You said?

76
00:07:49,904 --> 00:07:51,205
Honey.

77
00:07:52,106 --> 00:07:54,508
Do you have any idea
what I've been through?

78
00:07:56,077 --> 00:07:59,547
You know how hard things have
been for me?

79
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:03,317
Oh my God.
- I've been having some ideas.

80
00:08:03,451 --> 00:08:05,886
Floating around in my head.

81
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:09,156
Trying to figure out who she is.

82
00:08:09,290 --> 00:08:11,625
Who's she?

83
00:08:12,259 --> 00:08:13,828
There you are.

84
00:08:14,528 --> 00:08:15,896
You...

85
00:08:16,664 --> 00:08:18,899
that's what you said.

86
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:21,769
It's what you said.

87
00:08:22,370 --> 00:08:26,273
That's what you said, honey.
That's what you said...

88
00:08:26,407 --> 00:08:28,919
- I don't know what you're talking about...
- That's what you said!

89
00:08:28,943 --> 00:08:31,312
That's what you said.

90
00:08:31,445 --> 00:08:33,914
Okay stop, please, stop okay.

91
00:08:34,048 --> 00:08:38,486
Just just breathe
okay let's just breathe.

92
00:08:38,652 --> 00:08:40,021
OK.

93
00:08:40,488 --> 00:08:42,723
Honey look at yourself.

94
00:08:42,990 --> 00:08:45,693
What are you talking about?

95
00:08:45,893 --> 00:08:49,130
I'm sorry I don't know
what I did.

96
00:08:49,363 --> 00:08:51,032
I didn't mean to do anything.

97
00:08:51,165 --> 00:08:52,299
I'm so sorry,

98
00:08:53,134 --> 00:08:54,535
Okay?

99
00:08:56,537 --> 00:08:59,508
I just want my husband back.

100
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:01,375
Can I have him back?

101
00:09:02,343 --> 00:09:05,212
Can I just have my normal
husband back OK?

102
00:09:05,346 --> 00:09:06,847
You're right.

103
00:09:08,749 --> 00:09:09,749
I'm so sorry.

104
00:09:09,784 --> 00:09:11,285
It's okay...

105
00:09:15,122 --> 00:09:16,757
Well, I've been acting weird.

106
00:09:18,726 --> 00:09:20,161
I've been, uh,

107
00:09:20,628 --> 00:09:22,730
acting strange so...

108
00:09:24,732 --> 00:09:26,033
It's embarrassing.

109
00:09:26,167 --> 00:09:27,201
Uh.

110
00:09:28,069 --> 00:09:29,070
All right.

111
00:09:29,336 --> 00:09:34,041
Mid life crisis alert, I'm gonna
do the dishes.

112
00:09:36,143 --> 00:09:37,912
Sorry about that.

113
00:09:38,513 --> 00:09:40,014
Uh.

114
00:09:40,549 --> 00:09:41,849
Don't know what that was so...

115
00:09:43,417 --> 00:09:44,752
Let me just...

116
00:09:55,663 --> 00:09:58,699
No. No honey,
there is one thing.

117
00:09:58,866 --> 00:10:00,835
About the dishes.

118
00:10:04,539 --> 00:10:06,273
I could use a hand.

119
00:10:14,048 --> 00:10:16,050
- Get it in the hole!
- Help me!

120
00:10:16,183 --> 00:10:17,586
- Please!
- Get in the hole!

121
00:10:17,718 --> 00:10:19,253
Just get it in the hole!

122
00:10:19,386 --> 00:10:23,558
Squeal like a pig baby!
Scream like a freaking baby!

123
00:10:23,691 --> 00:10:25,259
Fucking baby!

124
00:10:30,664 --> 00:10:31,744
It's game night.

125
00:10:37,606 --> 00:10:39,039
She has a fan.

126
00:10:40,474 --> 00:10:41,543
No.

127
00:11:03,898 --> 00:11:06,000
I am she.

128
00:11:07,536 --> 00:11:09,904
Oh my God,

129
00:11:10,639 --> 00:11:14,375
I'm so sorry you guys...

130
00:11:14,842 --> 00:11:16,210
What are you doing bud?

131
00:11:16,343 --> 00:11:18,679
I am her, she is me.

132
00:11:18,812 --> 00:11:20,814
I am always she.

133
00:11:21,382 --> 00:11:23,717
Call 911?

134
00:11:24,185 --> 00:11:25,252
Please.

135
00:11:27,821 --> 00:11:29,056
Okay...

136
00:11:44,038 --> 00:11:46,740
It's OK, honey,
we're right behind you, OK?

137
00:11:58,319 --> 00:11:59,621
Alright.

138
00:12:00,154 --> 00:12:02,823
Your wife's pretty cute man.

139
00:12:02,957 --> 00:12:04,225
Gonna have to get you better,

140
00:12:04,358 --> 00:12:06,293
or I'm going to steal
her from you.

141
00:12:06,427 --> 00:12:08,362
Heart rate is dropping
seems to be leveling out.

142
00:12:08,495 --> 00:12:12,199
Sir, can you hear us?

143
00:12:12,534 --> 00:12:15,202
Sir, nod if you can hear us, OK.

144
00:12:15,436 --> 00:12:17,706
Looks like someone's
coming back to reality.

145
00:12:17,838 --> 00:12:22,176
You're gonna feel a little pinch
here on the count of three, OK?

146
00:12:22,309 --> 00:12:23,978
1... 2... 3...

147
00:12:24,111 --> 00:12:27,915
It's gonna make you feel
a lot better.

148
00:12:28,315 --> 00:12:29,817
How's that feel?

149
00:12:29,984 --> 00:12:31,218
It feel...

150
00:12:31,385 --> 00:12:32,687
It feels good.

151
00:12:32,953 --> 00:12:34,188
I feel good.

152
00:12:37,726 --> 00:12:39,927
That's what she said.

153
00:12:40,794 --> 00:12:43,764
We're coming in with a male
unknown-

154
00:12:47,001 --> 00:12:49,303
That doesn't sound good.

155
00:12:49,704 --> 00:12:54,375
See that's why I gotta stop
taking these night shifts.

156
00:12:54,509 --> 00:12:55,809
I can tell you.

157
00:12:56,176 --> 00:13:00,114
Nothing good ever happens
after 10:00 PM.

158
00:13:00,247 --> 00:13:01,248
Anyways.

159
00:13:01,782 --> 00:13:03,083
I'm hungry.

160
00:13:09,758 --> 00:13:11,925
<i>This is Edna.</i>

161
00:13:14,395 --> 00:13:19,466
<i>She's full of dreams and ideas
that never came to be.</i>

162
00:13:20,801 --> 00:13:23,037
<i>She spends most nights
here crying alone</i>

163
00:13:23,170 --> 00:13:25,306
<i>in this dusty kitchen.</i>

164
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:30,077
<i>Revisiting the better times
of her memory.</i>

165
00:13:31,312 --> 00:13:34,281
Pretty depressing stuff, huh?

166
00:13:34,549 --> 00:13:37,851
The only clear and constant
thought that crosses her mind.

167
00:13:37,985 --> 00:13:40,954
Is if she only had a man
to get through life with,

168
00:13:41,088 --> 00:13:42,856
maybe things will get better

169
00:13:42,990 --> 00:13:45,859
but only had a man
to get through life with.

170
00:13:45,993 --> 00:13:49,029
Maybe things will get better.

171
00:13:51,932 --> 00:13:54,101
Trip to Aspen this year
was amazing.

172
00:13:54,234 --> 00:13:56,136
So incredible yeah,
we stayed at the scene.

173
00:13:56,270 --> 00:13:58,773
Yeah.
- Oh my God I love it.

174
00:13:58,906 --> 00:14:00,307
It was so nice.

175
00:14:04,378 --> 00:14:07,414
Yeah no but the spa's
way better.

176
00:14:07,782 --> 00:14:11,118
It's way better. And Stephen
took his clients there last year...

177
00:14:26,534 --> 00:14:30,672
<i>She didn't want to be
here anymore.</i>

178
00:14:31,372 --> 00:14:33,474
<i>So she chose a bridge.</i>

179
00:14:35,777 --> 00:14:38,680
<i>She listened for a voice
to stop her.</i>

180
00:14:38,813 --> 00:14:40,381
<i>But it never came.</i>

181
00:14:41,215 --> 00:14:48,055
<i>Only the daunting whispers of
wind pushing her further to the edge.</i>

182
00:14:51,593 --> 00:14:52,827
<i>Then...</i>

183
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:55,730
<i>when she least expected it...</i>

184
00:14:55,864 --> 00:14:59,299
<i>Something grabbed her attention.</i>

185
00:16:31,893 --> 00:16:34,428
Oh my God, that looks so good.

186
00:16:34,829 --> 00:16:37,966
Oh I've also been spit balling
some names.

187
00:16:38,098 --> 00:16:41,636
What do you think
about Ricky, hmmm?

188
00:16:42,637 --> 00:16:43,805
Yay or nay?

189
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:46,340
Yay!

190
00:16:46,473 --> 00:16:48,208
Ready! Here comes the airplane.

191
00:16:57,217 --> 00:17:02,657
<i>She finally found a man
to get through life with.</i>

192
00:17:02,790 --> 00:17:04,759
<i>Things were better.</i>

193
00:17:06,460 --> 00:17:10,097
<i>He was everything she
ever wanted.</i>

194
00:17:10,932 --> 00:17:12,567
<i>A good listener.</i>

195
00:17:14,936 --> 00:17:17,170
<i>A shoulder to lean on.</i>

196
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:22,476
<i>The strong silent type.</i>

197
00:17:25,379 --> 00:17:28,282
<i>The prom date she never had.</i>

198
00:17:30,417 --> 00:17:32,620
<i>She was so glad they met.</i>

199
00:17:32,754 --> 00:17:34,321
I'm so glad we met.

200
00:17:34,989 --> 00:17:38,425
<i>And although he may
have been dead.</i>

201
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:41,261
<i>For the first time in years.</i>

202
00:17:41,428 --> 00:17:43,130
<i>She was alive.</i>

203
00:17:50,270 --> 00:17:51,506
Oooh.

204
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:53,675
Can't even begin to tell you,

205
00:17:53,808 --> 00:17:58,546
how long, so long, we've been
waiting for Edna to find a man.

206
00:18:01,315 --> 00:18:03,317
Not that long.

207
00:18:11,258 --> 00:18:12,694
All right,

208
00:18:12,827 --> 00:18:13,827
subject change,

209
00:18:14,896 --> 00:18:16,496
So... Ricky,

210
00:18:16,698 --> 00:18:20,602
tell us about yourself,
what do you do?

211
00:18:21,636 --> 00:18:23,203
He's so cute,

212
00:18:23,337 --> 00:18:25,540
and so shy.

213
00:18:26,406 --> 00:18:27,709
Busy bee...
- OK, you know what,

214
00:18:27,842 --> 00:18:30,410
I can't, I there's
no way I can do this.

215
00:18:30,545 --> 00:18:32,513
Nope.
- Do what.

216
00:18:34,247 --> 00:18:35,282
Are you?

217
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:38,987
Seriously gonna make me say
this right now.

218
00:18:39,152 --> 00:18:40,287
Mm-hmm

219
00:18:42,590 --> 00:18:43,625
He's...

220
00:18:43,758 --> 00:18:44,892
He's dead.

221
00:18:45,994 --> 00:18:47,528
He's dead.

222
00:18:47,762 --> 00:18:50,282
Can you please just try
and be happy for me just for once

223
00:18:50,330 --> 00:18:51,799
I would be happy for you if you

224
00:18:51,933 --> 00:18:54,234
brought a boyfriend
along that was alive.

225
00:18:54,368 --> 00:18:57,605
- God. Can you stop?
- He's not so.

226
00:18:57,772 --> 00:18:58,772
He's not.

227
00:18:59,272 --> 00:19:00,575
I get it all right.

228
00:19:00,708 --> 00:19:02,977
Please stop.
- Edna.

229
00:19:03,111 --> 00:19:05,421
- You're embarrassing me in front of my date.
- You can't do this.

230
00:19:05,445 --> 00:19:07,147
- Yes I can.
- There's nobody...

231
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:08,850
Oh my God!

232
00:19:08,983 --> 00:19:10,685
- No.
- Oh God uhm.

233
00:19:12,620 --> 00:19:14,454
I find a man that I am
in love with

234
00:19:14,589 --> 00:19:16,189
and you can't even be
happy for me.

235
00:19:16,323 --> 00:19:19,192
It's disgusting. I would not
tell her what is going on here,

236
00:19:19,326 --> 00:19:21,161
- I... uhm...
- Yo.

237
00:19:21,294 --> 00:19:22,329
Help me out here.

238
00:19:22,462 --> 00:19:24,364
Uhm... Well.

239
00:19:27,001 --> 00:19:29,504
Yeah, it's pretty disturbing.

240
00:19:29,637 --> 00:19:30,437
Edna.

241
00:19:30,571 --> 00:19:32,339
You can't do this.

242
00:19:32,707 --> 00:19:37,344
I'm really worried
about your mental health.

243
00:19:39,212 --> 00:19:40,748
Fine.

244
00:19:41,983 --> 00:19:44,418
That's the way you feel.

245
00:19:46,154 --> 00:19:47,622
Come on Ricky.

246
00:19:48,523 --> 00:19:51,959
They hate us because
they ain't us.

247
00:19:52,225 --> 00:19:53,761
Yeah, that's it.

248
00:19:53,895 --> 00:19:55,228
Oh I'm so...

249
00:19:56,229 --> 00:19:57,230
sorry.

250
00:19:57,364 --> 00:19:59,801
Got him, there, okay...

251
00:20:00,835 --> 00:20:05,139
I'm never going to be able
to come here again.

252
00:20:05,272 --> 00:20:08,241
So I was thinking we could go to

253
00:20:08,442 --> 00:20:12,379
don't know the beach
or something tomorrow.

254
00:20:12,513 --> 00:20:16,651
I know you're not the biggest
fan of water, but.

255
00:20:16,784 --> 00:20:17,919
I don't know.

256
00:20:19,286 --> 00:20:21,756
We could do a picnic or...

257
00:20:36,504 --> 00:20:40,208
They never did make it
to the beach.

258
00:20:40,340 --> 00:20:43,443
Instead, she just stayed up
for days,

259
00:20:43,578 --> 00:20:47,347
fueled by her friend's
harsh opinions.

260
00:20:47,982 --> 00:20:50,484
In fact,
the more time that passed,

261
00:20:50,618 --> 00:20:54,522
the more lifeless he
seemed to become.

262
00:20:56,924 --> 00:20:58,626
Then once again,

263
00:20:59,093 --> 00:21:01,328
when she least expected.

264
00:21:01,461 --> 00:21:04,832
Something grabbed her attention.

265
00:24:12,620 --> 00:24:14,956
What happened to me?

266
00:24:18,592 --> 00:24:20,561
You weren't dead.

267
00:24:22,530 --> 00:24:25,599
And I brought you back to life.

268
00:24:28,903 --> 00:24:31,806
That was pretty cool of you.

269
00:24:40,348 --> 00:24:44,018
<i>He explained how his
actual name was Cider.</i>

270
00:24:44,151 --> 00:24:46,520
My actual name is cider.

271
00:24:47,054 --> 00:24:48,089
Really?

272
00:24:48,222 --> 00:24:49,924
- Like the drink?
- I know it's biblical.

273
00:24:50,057 --> 00:24:53,761
It means liqueur derived
from the juice of fruits.

274
00:24:53,894 --> 00:24:56,530
Yeah, so like the drink.

275
00:24:57,398 --> 00:24:58,666
Sure.

276
00:24:59,066 --> 00:25:00,201
Uh... well...

277
00:25:00,334 --> 00:25:02,503
It's just, I've been calling
you Ricky so...

278
00:25:02,636 --> 00:25:03,636
- Ricky?
- Yeah.

279
00:25:03,738 --> 00:25:05,673
Man do I seem Latin to you?

280
00:25:05,806 --> 00:25:08,509
No, no, I just,
always liked that name.

281
00:25:08,642 --> 00:25:10,478
Let's just stick with Cider.

282
00:25:10,611 --> 00:25:12,213
I feel like it's part
of my core.

283
00:25:12,346 --> 00:25:13,681
It's part of my essence.

284
00:25:13,814 --> 00:25:15,649
Oh yeah, of course.

285
00:25:15,783 --> 00:25:17,918
I mean it is your name.

286
00:25:18,919 --> 00:25:21,622
Rename you that's crazy.

287
00:25:24,558 --> 00:25:26,093
I'm dying for a grilled cheese.

288
00:25:26,227 --> 00:25:27,428
Doesn't that sound good?

289
00:25:27,561 --> 00:25:29,430
Those are fattening.

290
00:25:29,563 --> 00:25:31,298
This place is really cool,

291
00:25:31,432 --> 00:25:33,543
but it seems like they're trying to
capitalize on a young generation,

292
00:25:33,567 --> 00:25:35,202
revisiting vintage Americana,

293
00:25:35,336 --> 00:25:38,205
and I would think that would
include vegan options to just show

294
00:25:38,339 --> 00:25:39,740
a nod to that generation.

295
00:25:39,874 --> 00:25:41,208
Hey, we know you, we get you.

296
00:25:41,342 --> 00:25:42,543
We know what you want.

297
00:25:42,676 --> 00:25:44,378
Oh I didn't know you're a vegan.

298
00:25:44,513 --> 00:25:46,180
No I'm not.

299
00:25:48,315 --> 00:25:49,750
But...

300
00:25:50,718 --> 00:25:54,055
You don't have to be
vegan to care.

301
00:26:01,796 --> 00:26:04,298
What are you laughing at?

302
00:26:04,698 --> 00:26:06,934
OK, be honest.
What do you think?

303
00:26:07,068 --> 00:26:12,740
My ho useless friend Vic spent two years
collecting clothes and reclaimed fabrics,

304
00:26:12,873 --> 00:26:19,847
and we gave birth to this outfit right
after our first experience with the DMT.

305
00:26:19,980 --> 00:26:22,349
That's exactly what it
looks like.

306
00:26:22,483 --> 00:26:23,552
No,

307
00:26:23,818 --> 00:26:26,887
I think it makes my ass pop too.

308
00:26:40,101 --> 00:26:41,202
What's uh?

309
00:26:42,303 --> 00:26:43,538
What's this?

310
00:26:44,438 --> 00:26:49,276
Well, I didn't want to come
right out and say it, but this is me.

311
00:26:49,410 --> 00:26:50,644
Really?

312
00:26:51,779 --> 00:26:52,980
That's you.

313
00:26:53,614 --> 00:26:58,385
- Singing...
- Singing, drumming, strumming, producing.

314
00:26:58,520 --> 00:27:01,956
I spent three years of my life
traveling with Russian hobos

315
00:27:02,089 --> 00:27:04,291
on the back of a cargo train
and I wrote this song.

316
00:27:04,425 --> 00:27:05,594
It's about that-

317
00:27:08,129 --> 00:27:10,397
Oh shh, shh, Shut up.

318
00:27:10,532 --> 00:27:11,799
Wait.

319
00:27:12,433 --> 00:27:14,536
This is my favorite part.

320
00:27:14,668 --> 00:27:16,670
This is the real genius seed.

321
00:27:29,750 --> 00:27:32,920
Come on, look at what I'm doing.

322
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:29,310
- Lower body. Lower.
- Like this?

323
00:28:29,443 --> 00:28:31,312
Like th-Lower!

324
00:28:31,445 --> 00:28:32,846
Like.
- Ah.

325
00:28:32,980 --> 00:28:35,082
Yeah, it's not really your
fault, it's your body.

326
00:28:37,985 --> 00:28:40,387
OK, ready, watch this.

327
00:29:22,396 --> 00:29:24,699
<i>It was then she realized
she was never going to let</i>

328
00:29:24,832 --> 00:29:28,936
<i>her happiness be dependent
on another human again.</i>

329
00:29:29,069 --> 00:29:30,938
<i>As he forwarded down that river,</i>

330
00:29:31,071 --> 00:29:36,076
<i>she realized that true importance
and power of independence.</i>

331
00:29:36,210 --> 00:29:38,279
<i>The lonesome nights and string
of bad dates</i>

332
00:29:38,412 --> 00:29:43,150
<i>were a dream compared to
the nightmare she called Rick.</i>

333
00:29:43,284 --> 00:29:45,687
<i>But whatever the fuck
his name was,</i>

334
00:29:45,819 --> 00:29:47,622
as you'll see in our next story,

335
00:29:47,756 --> 00:29:50,457
we're going to focus
on the power of friendship.

336
00:29:50,592 --> 00:29:52,627
Might want to grab some popcorn
on this one.

337
00:29:53,794 --> 00:29:56,130
It's about to get wild.

338
00:30:10,144 --> 00:30:12,479
3 little piggies
came to the market.

339
00:30:12,614 --> 00:30:14,783
Everyone get the fuck down.

340
00:30:14,915 --> 00:30:17,017
I said everyone get the
fuck down!

341
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:20,921
Not you fat boy.

342
00:30:21,055 --> 00:30:22,423
Get up.

343
00:30:22,557 --> 00:30:24,559
We're going to make
this nice and easy.

344
00:30:24,693 --> 00:30:26,160
You do exactly as we say.

345
00:30:26,293 --> 00:30:28,495
Let us do our thing
and that's it.

346
00:30:28,630 --> 00:30:30,397
Do you understand?

347
00:30:30,532 --> 00:30:32,499
Do you understand!?

348
00:30:33,735 --> 00:30:35,069
Why you doing this?

349
00:30:35,202 --> 00:30:38,272
What a great question.

350
00:30:59,059 --> 00:31:01,859
Dude you've been looking
at her all night. Just go talk to her.

351
00:31:01,895 --> 00:31:03,130
Why do you do this?

352
00:31:03,263 --> 00:31:04,465
Do what?

353
00:31:04,932 --> 00:31:06,133
Push me.

354
00:31:06,266 --> 00:31:08,102
I don't push you. Luke
do I push him?

355
00:31:08,235 --> 00:31:09,370
You're trying to help?

356
00:31:09,504 --> 00:31:11,573
He's trying to help.
- Thank you.

357
00:31:11,706 --> 00:31:15,943
Listen guys, I appreciate the sentiment
and everything but I'm fine..I... I...

358
00:31:16,076 --> 00:31:17,545
I don't need it.

359
00:31:17,679 --> 00:31:19,848
You know why you guys do this
every week after week.

360
00:31:19,980 --> 00:31:21,014
No.

361
00:31:21,716 --> 00:31:24,552
Because you guys have settled
down, we've gotten older,

362
00:31:24,686 --> 00:31:27,756
you've gotten comfy and listen,
there's nothing wrong with that at all.

363
00:31:27,921 --> 00:31:29,256
It's totally fine,

364
00:31:29,390 --> 00:31:32,493
but you guys want to go
talk to a girl like that.

365
00:31:32,627 --> 00:31:34,194
I don't, you do.

366
00:31:34,629 --> 00:31:36,029
Okay.

367
00:31:36,163 --> 00:31:39,066
And you project that
onto me and it's... Wow.

368
00:31:39,199 --> 00:31:40,599
- I'm projecting?
- You're laughing,

369
00:31:40,668 --> 00:31:42,345
it's true though.
- I'm trying to help you out.

370
00:31:42,369 --> 00:31:43,649
What kind of friends would we be

371
00:31:43,772 --> 00:31:45,305
if we weren't trying to
get you laid?

372
00:31:45,439 --> 00:31:47,341
You guys would be
awesome friends, like friends

373
00:31:47,474 --> 00:31:49,511
that I would wanna come
out with every Wednesday

374
00:31:49,644 --> 00:31:52,079
and do this kind of shit
but this...

375
00:31:52,212 --> 00:31:53,882
tired of it.

376
00:31:54,014 --> 00:31:55,282
Jesus man.

377
00:31:56,183 --> 00:32:00,789
Sorry, it's just it's more complicated
than you guys would think okay?

378
00:32:00,954 --> 00:32:03,357
- What's so complicated about it?
- There you go pushing.

379
00:32:03,490 --> 00:32:05,527
I'm not pushing.
I'm asking a question.

380
00:32:05,660 --> 00:32:06,960
He's asking a question.

381
00:32:07,094 --> 00:32:08,506
A friendly question.
- It's out a concern.

382
00:32:08,530 --> 00:32:12,299
- Stop being so sensitive.
- I can't come.

383
00:32:12,433 --> 00:32:13,568
OK.

384
00:32:14,869 --> 00:32:16,103
Say what?

385
00:32:17,037 --> 00:32:18,071
I...

386
00:32:18,205 --> 00:32:19,541
Come here.

387
00:32:20,174 --> 00:32:21,709
No come here.

388
00:32:23,243 --> 00:32:25,078
I can't come.

389
00:32:25,914 --> 00:32:28,348
I've never been able to.

390
00:32:29,016 --> 00:32:30,718
What like never?

391
00:32:32,953 --> 00:32:34,188
Once.

392
00:32:35,289 --> 00:32:36,691
I came close.

393
00:32:38,726 --> 00:32:40,360
I was like 14.

394
00:32:40,961 --> 00:32:43,297
Was laying in bed and I.

395
00:32:43,631 --> 00:32:45,199
Figured why not.

396
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:47,569
And so I.

397
00:32:48,135 --> 00:32:49,647
Was in the middle
of going at it, and I

398
00:32:49,671 --> 00:32:53,073
heard a window
break in the other room.

399
00:32:53,207 --> 00:32:54,341
And I got out of bed.

400
00:32:54,475 --> 00:32:56,544
I pulled up my pants and...

401
00:32:56,678 --> 00:32:59,246
Peaked my little head
around the corner.

402
00:32:59,379 --> 00:33:02,015
There was this burglar.

403
00:33:03,217 --> 00:33:06,320
He was just taking a bunch
of my dad's shit.

404
00:33:06,453 --> 00:33:09,924
Shit, so you're like
traumatized,

405
00:33:10,290 --> 00:33:13,060
that's that's the thing I...

406
00:33:13,260 --> 00:33:15,996
I sat there and I,
I watched him.

407
00:33:16,129 --> 00:33:17,464
I...

408
00:33:17,866 --> 00:33:19,834
And lo and behold, I...

409
00:33:20,467 --> 00:33:22,637
Was as hard as a rock.

410
00:33:30,143 --> 00:33:31,613
Wait, what?

411
00:33:32,012 --> 00:33:35,148
It's like the more shit this guy
grabbed.

412
00:33:35,282 --> 00:33:37,117
And the heavier his...

413
00:33:37,251 --> 00:33:39,319
His breathing got.

414
00:33:39,587 --> 00:33:41,154
The harder I got.

415
00:33:42,557 --> 00:33:45,259
I was weirdly kind of hot.

416
00:33:49,864 --> 00:33:51,031
So like I said.

417
00:33:51,666 --> 00:33:55,737
It's a lot more complicated
than you would think.

418
00:33:55,870 --> 00:33:58,205
Yeah.

419
00:34:05,145 --> 00:34:07,481
So shots or...

420
00:34:08,415 --> 00:34:10,183
I have an idea.

421
00:34:34,642 --> 00:34:38,312
Take it all,
then let's kill the kid.

422
00:34:38,445 --> 00:34:40,615
Sounds good.

423
00:34:49,958 --> 00:34:53,761
Should we like cut off
his face and take turns wearing it?

424
00:34:53,895 --> 00:34:55,329
Yeah.

425
00:34:59,033 --> 00:35:00,133
Guys I...

426
00:35:00,334 --> 00:35:02,102
I know it's you.

427
00:35:03,270 --> 00:35:05,105
Okay.
- You gotta die now!

428
00:35:05,238 --> 00:35:07,685
Can you get that out of
my eyes please? It's really early.

429
00:35:07,709 --> 00:35:09,944
- Are you hard?
- Nope.

430
00:35:10,243 --> 00:35:12,346
- You sure?
- Positive.

431
00:35:12,479 --> 00:35:14,682
- Can we see it?
- Nope.

432
00:35:15,583 --> 00:35:17,284
What what was it
that didn't work?

433
00:35:17,417 --> 00:35:20,855
I can 100%
see your faces right now.

434
00:35:22,757 --> 00:35:25,760
Well, that's super
disappointing.

435
00:35:25,893 --> 00:35:28,630
I want to go, this is stupid.

436
00:35:28,763 --> 00:35:29,597
Okay.

437
00:35:29,731 --> 00:35:32,700
- Bye dude sweet dreams.
- Yup.

438
00:36:00,327 --> 00:36:02,664
Jimmy, this is getting
ridiculous man.

439
00:36:02,797 --> 00:36:04,164
We almost had him man.

440
00:36:04,297 --> 00:36:05,499
No, no, we didn't.

441
00:36:05,633 --> 00:36:09,003
We need something bigger,
something better.

442
00:36:09,137 --> 00:36:10,404
Like what?

443
00:36:17,177 --> 00:36:19,479
Why are you doing this?

444
00:36:19,847 --> 00:36:20,982
Anything?

445
00:36:21,949 --> 00:36:24,251
No.

446
00:36:24,384 --> 00:36:26,253
What about this?

447
00:36:28,056 --> 00:36:29,857
No no.

448
00:36:30,758 --> 00:36:32,192
Fuck!

449
00:36:36,097 --> 00:36:37,999
The fuck! No!

450
00:36:38,265 --> 00:36:42,603
I need you to be fucking straight with
me right here right now, is this happening?

451
00:36:42,737 --> 00:36:46,040
- I don't know.
- What do you mean you don't know!

452
00:36:46,174 --> 00:36:47,407
I'm sorry!

453
00:36:51,244 --> 00:36:52,547
What?

454
00:36:57,552 --> 00:36:58,720
Get down.

455
00:36:59,721 --> 00:37:00,855
KCPD!

456
00:37:00,988 --> 00:37:02,228
- Get down!
- Put your gun down!

457
00:37:02,289 --> 00:37:03,758
Put your fucking gun down!

458
00:37:06,994 --> 00:37:10,665
Get on the ground now!
On the ground, there you go!

459
00:37:10,798 --> 00:37:11,999
Don't move.

460
00:37:15,703 --> 00:37:16,738
Oh Jesus.

461
00:37:18,206 --> 00:37:20,074
We gotta guy down over here.

462
00:37:50,104 --> 00:37:51,371
I'm sorry.

463
00:37:52,339 --> 00:37:54,675
This was huge mistake.

464
00:37:58,112 --> 00:37:59,379
No.

465
00:38:03,918 --> 00:38:05,485
It wasn't.

466
00:38:26,574 --> 00:38:27,809
We gotta go!

467
00:38:32,013 --> 00:38:33,781
Hold your ground!

468
00:38:41,189 --> 00:38:43,423
Don't do it!

469
00:38:46,093 --> 00:38:47,595
Drop the gun!

470
00:39:31,138 --> 00:39:33,708
<i>What kind of
friends would we be?</i>

471
00:39:33,841 --> 00:39:36,811
<i>If we were trying to get laid.</i>

472
00:39:38,079 --> 00:39:41,048
<i>The best friends.</i>

473
00:39:41,182 --> 00:39:44,986
<i>The best freaking friends
I ever had.</i>

474
00:41:19,413 --> 00:41:22,283
Hey baby girl baby girl.

475
00:41:22,817 --> 00:41:27,154
Yep, I just just dropped off
my last package.

476
00:41:30,057 --> 00:41:31,625
That's cool.

477
00:41:32,593 --> 00:41:35,930
But hey listen, I got 2 words
for you

478
00:41:36,063 --> 00:41:37,665
red box.

479
00:41:39,233 --> 00:41:40,468
Yep.

480
00:41:40,801 --> 00:41:42,837
Daddy is going to
pick up a little flick and

481
00:41:42,970 --> 00:41:46,874
then he's going to
give you a little di-

482
00:41:51,712 --> 00:41:54,882
Hey, let me let me
call you back.

483
00:43:42,056 --> 00:43:43,491
Hello.

484
00:43:44,125 --> 00:43:49,296
Kritika Express, I need a
signature here! In the back!

485
00:43:49,430 --> 00:43:53,667
We're uh, we're advised
not to do that, Sir.

486
00:43:54,603 --> 00:43:58,272
I just need a signature
and I'll be on my way.

487
00:43:58,405 --> 00:44:00,641
Try and find me.

488
00:44:05,379 --> 00:44:06,780
OK...

489
00:44:41,849 --> 00:44:43,150
Hello.

490
00:44:46,621 --> 00:44:48,222
Sir.

491
00:44:53,628 --> 00:44:55,062
Wow.

492
00:44:56,430 --> 00:44:57,798
Yep.

493
00:44:59,934 --> 00:45:02,203
Just need a signature
here on the package

494
00:45:02,336 --> 00:45:05,306
and I'll be on my way so...
- We don't have much time,

495
00:45:05,439 --> 00:45:07,208
so I'll brass tacks it.

496
00:45:07,341 --> 00:45:09,410
Probably wondering why
you're holding a package

497
00:45:09,544 --> 00:45:13,047
addressed to here,
but with your name on it.

498
00:45:13,180 --> 00:45:15,149
Yeah.

499
00:45:15,684 --> 00:45:17,184
Coincidence?

500
00:45:17,686 --> 00:45:19,153
How did you know that's my name?

501
00:45:19,286 --> 00:45:23,257
Look in order to not disturb
the space time continuum,

502
00:45:23,390 --> 00:45:27,161
I need to be injected
with your... with our DNA.

503
00:45:27,294 --> 00:45:30,665
Otherwise the chance
the whole process fails,

504
00:45:30,798 --> 00:45:32,399
and then we're fucked.

505
00:45:32,534 --> 00:45:34,603
What are you talking
about talking about?

506
00:45:34,735 --> 00:45:40,374
I'm talking about the end
la fin, vamoose, extinction

507
00:45:40,508 --> 00:45:42,109
in exactly 92 minutes

508
00:45:42,243 --> 00:45:44,546
and 46 seconds an asteroid
is going to come down-

509
00:45:44,679 --> 00:45:45,879
Oh, I get it.

510
00:45:46,013 --> 00:45:49,750
You're one of these crazy
desert guys, huh?

511
00:45:49,883 --> 00:45:52,319
You talk to lizards and,

512
00:45:52,520 --> 00:45:53,921
hang out in the sun.

513
00:45:54,054 --> 00:45:56,090
I don't have time
to small talk with details.

514
00:45:56,223 --> 00:45:58,593
I'm you from the future
and you're me from the past.

515
00:45:58,727 --> 00:46:04,666
And the only way to stop this thing
is if you blast me with your DNA.

516
00:46:08,603 --> 00:46:12,072
What?
- Oh come on, you think it's funny?

517
00:46:12,206 --> 00:46:17,077
Well, it won't be so funny
when we're tiny bits of ash.

518
00:46:17,211 --> 00:46:19,847
All right, let's let's play,
pretend and say I believe you,

519
00:46:19,980 --> 00:46:22,584
which I absolutely do not.

520
00:46:22,717 --> 00:46:24,952
You expect me to do what just,

521
00:46:25,085 --> 00:46:28,422
pull my hair out
and give it to you.

522
00:46:30,257 --> 00:46:34,295
It's going to take more
than that, buddy.

523
00:46:36,330 --> 00:46:37,865
Saliva.

524
00:46:38,633 --> 00:46:40,100
Close.

525
00:46:44,271 --> 00:46:45,439
Blood.

526
00:46:45,573 --> 00:46:47,308
Ooh, gross...

527
00:46:47,776 --> 00:46:49,577
But warmer.

528
00:46:53,113 --> 00:46:54,749
I think you just,

529
00:46:55,215 --> 00:46:57,418
need the sign for
the package sir.

530
00:46:57,552 --> 00:47:01,255
Well unfortunately I
can't do that.

531
00:47:01,723 --> 00:47:04,892
Until you do what's necessary.

532
00:47:07,995 --> 00:47:09,463
Well...

533
00:47:09,597 --> 00:47:12,099
Kritika's policy you can just
pick it up at the office.

534
00:47:12,232 --> 00:47:13,233
Mm hmm.

535
00:47:20,441 --> 00:47:23,043
I ain't happy about it
either, kid,

536
00:47:23,177 --> 00:47:28,516
but it's the only way to ensure
the survival of mankind.

537
00:47:41,362 --> 00:47:45,499
Sorry, the number you
have dialed is not in service at this time.

538
00:47:45,633 --> 00:47:47,401
Not one fucking bar.

539
00:47:51,573 --> 00:47:54,576
I'm you from the future.
You're me from the past.

540
00:47:59,046 --> 00:48:02,449
You're gonna be okay.

541
00:48:03,083 --> 00:48:05,152
This...

542
00:48:07,121 --> 00:48:09,022
Come on, come on.

543
00:48:11,392 --> 00:48:14,161
It's unbelievable.
- Well, if that ain't fate.

544
00:48:14,294 --> 00:48:16,598
I don't know what to tell you.

545
00:48:16,731 --> 00:48:17,731
Well it's not.

546
00:48:17,799 --> 00:48:19,634
It's not fate, it's illegal,

547
00:48:19,768 --> 00:48:22,837
you're kind of holding me
captive here so...

548
00:48:22,970 --> 00:48:24,672
You think it was me.

549
00:48:25,272 --> 00:48:28,610
I've been here with you
the whole time.

550
00:48:28,743 --> 00:48:30,277
Relax man.

551
00:48:31,078 --> 00:48:32,614
You hungry?

552
00:48:33,515 --> 00:48:34,582
No.

553
00:48:34,948 --> 00:48:36,885
How about a cold one?

554
00:48:37,017 --> 00:48:38,553
No, I'm good.

555
00:49:00,675 --> 00:49:03,845
So what do you suggest
that I do?

556
00:49:04,178 --> 00:49:05,847
I told you, man.

557
00:49:06,581 --> 00:49:08,148
Look, I know it's a lot
to take in,

558
00:49:08,282 --> 00:49:09,551
but with all due respect,

559
00:49:09,684 --> 00:49:11,294
I'm the one that's going
to have to take it.

560
00:49:11,318 --> 00:49:13,287
I'm not gonna fuck
you, man. This is insane.

561
00:49:13,420 --> 00:49:15,255
Well unfortunately fucking me

562
00:49:15,389 --> 00:49:17,759
is the only way
you're getting out of here.

563
00:49:17,892 --> 00:49:22,597
And if you don't, you ain't going
to have much time to do anything.

564
00:49:22,730 --> 00:49:25,375
Oh yeah, it's the only way I'm
getting out of here. Well watch this.

565
00:49:25,399 --> 00:49:31,438
Oh well you know it's a long walk
from here what you plan on hitchhiking, ha!

566
00:49:31,573 --> 00:49:32,907
Good luck.

567
00:49:33,641 --> 00:49:36,711
This guy is fucking insane.

568
00:49:36,845 --> 00:49:38,613
He's a desert rat.

569
00:49:39,079 --> 00:49:43,217
That's all he is
just a fucking desert rat.

570
00:49:43,651 --> 00:49:45,319
Full of shit.

571
00:49:46,987 --> 00:49:51,626
His voice is fucking 2... 3
octaves higher than mine.

572
00:49:57,998 --> 00:49:59,299
Hey look,

573
00:49:59,701 --> 00:50:02,804
I know that seeing yourself
living in shit like this

574
00:50:02,937 --> 00:50:07,074
isn't the picturesque life
you imagine for yourself.

575
00:50:07,207 --> 00:50:09,878
But you know its got
its perks, you know.

576
00:50:10,010 --> 00:50:12,012
You live a very full life.

577
00:50:12,145 --> 00:50:18,586
Sure, there's that little black tar heroin
phase that eventually leads to most,

578
00:50:18,720 --> 00:50:21,255
if not all, friends and family
cutting you out completely.

579
00:50:21,388 --> 00:50:25,927
But you know, that's what 25 years
of delivering packages does to a man.

580
00:50:26,059 --> 00:50:28,730
Can you just please shut up?

581
00:50:29,129 --> 00:50:30,264
Please.
- Sure.

582
00:50:30,397 --> 00:50:33,535
- Thank you.
- Yeah, sure, no worries

583
00:50:33,668 --> 00:50:36,804
Hey, you know we got
a birthday coming up.

584
00:50:36,938 --> 00:50:38,706
That's exciting.

585
00:50:41,441 --> 00:50:44,712
How did you know that?
- I got a bottle of the good stuff in the Dome.

586
00:50:44,846 --> 00:50:48,048
We could, maybe do this
thing black out.

587
00:50:48,181 --> 00:50:49,717
Nah I'm good man.

588
00:50:49,851 --> 00:50:51,862
I don't know how else to tell you that.
- Okay, alright.

589
00:50:51,886 --> 00:50:52,921
All right.

590
00:50:53,086 --> 00:50:54,354
Hey look

591
00:50:54,722 --> 00:50:59,459
why don't we like I don't know
ease into this thing.

592
00:51:00,460 --> 00:51:04,933
I could start like nibbling at
your neck, or something like that.

593
00:51:05,065 --> 00:51:06,266
Stop please.

594
00:51:06,500 --> 00:51:08,368
You're so fucking weird.

595
00:51:08,502 --> 00:51:11,005
Are you not reading
my body language at like...

596
00:51:11,138 --> 00:51:12,674
Can you just shut
the fuck up please?

597
00:51:12,807 --> 00:51:14,308
OK I got it.

598
00:51:15,108 --> 00:51:18,245
Why don't we go inside?
It's kind of cold out here.

599
00:51:18,378 --> 00:51:20,815
I promise I ain't gonna
do anything weird.

600
00:51:20,949 --> 00:51:23,651
Absolutely nothing weird.

601
00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:27,589
Scouts honor.

602
00:51:31,325 --> 00:51:34,596
Come on, it's cold out here.

603
00:51:39,567 --> 00:51:43,037
You know how I know
you're not me?

604
00:51:43,170 --> 00:51:44,706
Your TV sucks.

605
00:51:45,773 --> 00:51:46,874
Hmm.

606
00:51:47,441 --> 00:51:50,778
This do anything for
your big boy.

607
00:51:52,013 --> 00:51:54,348
Your... your nipples?

608
00:51:55,049 --> 00:51:56,751
No makes me feel,

609
00:51:57,652 --> 00:52:03,190
Pretty uncomfortable.
- Don't knock-'em till you try-'em.

610
00:52:03,323 --> 00:52:06,628
I got a girl with perfect
nipples.

611
00:52:07,528 --> 00:52:09,697
Waiting for me at home

612
00:52:09,831 --> 00:52:11,599
in a nice bed with,

613
00:52:12,466 --> 00:52:13,467
clean sheets.

614
00:52:13,601 --> 00:52:15,469
They're not always clean.

615
00:52:15,603 --> 00:52:18,271
What is that supposed to mean?

616
00:52:18,405 --> 00:52:21,609
Let's face it, you ain't
Brad Pitt.

617
00:52:22,543 --> 00:52:24,078
She's a hot club girl.

618
00:52:24,211 --> 00:52:25,780
Tons of options.

619
00:52:26,814 --> 00:52:30,118
And that Armenian DJ that's
always hanging around.

620
00:52:32,587 --> 00:52:34,822
He's a friend.
- Oh wake up man.

621
00:52:34,956 --> 00:52:38,926
Who's in your Christmas
card last year?

622
00:52:39,694 --> 00:52:43,898
So she's she's cheating on me
now. Is that what you're saying?

623
00:52:45,933 --> 00:52:49,871
Why am I watching a children's
show with a dirty bum, in a dome.

624
00:52:50,004 --> 00:52:52,507
What am I even doing here.

625
00:52:54,341 --> 00:52:56,209
Yep, I'm leaving can't do it.

626
00:52:56,343 --> 00:52:59,547
There he goes again, wait!

627
00:53:01,181 --> 00:53:03,785
- What.
- Open the package.

628
00:53:04,418 --> 00:53:08,355
- What?
- The package you brought, open it.

629
00:53:08,790 --> 00:53:11,859
You need to see what's inside.

630
00:54:05,479 --> 00:54:07,414
There's no way.

631
00:54:11,384 --> 00:54:13,286
There's no way.

632
00:54:14,989 --> 00:54:16,758
Go fuck yourself.

633
00:54:21,529 --> 00:54:23,497
Go fuck yourself.

634
00:54:28,401 --> 00:54:30,370
Go fuck yourself.

635
00:54:45,452 --> 00:54:50,091
<i>I'm you from the future
and you're me from the past.</i>

636
00:54:50,224 --> 00:54:55,328
<i>I'm not gonna fuck you
man. This is insane.</i>

637
00:54:57,198 --> 00:54:59,100
<i>Well, unfortunately fucking me</i>

638
00:54:59,233 --> 00:55:01,501
<i>is the only way
you're getting out of here.</i>

639
00:55:01,636 --> 00:55:07,575
<i>And if you don't, you're not going
to have much time to do anything.</i>

640
00:55:19,020 --> 00:55:20,721
Hey.

641
00:55:22,290 --> 00:55:23,724
Hey yourself.

642
00:55:29,664 --> 00:55:31,498
What are we doing?

643
00:55:32,399 --> 00:55:33,868
This is nuts.

644
00:55:35,169 --> 00:55:38,338
We're doing what's necessary.

645
00:55:50,685 --> 00:55:54,387
Let's bring this thing
home, brother.

646
00:55:56,123 --> 00:55:57,390
Oh.

647
00:56:31,993 --> 00:56:33,160
1.

648
00:56:33,393 --> 00:56:34,695
2.

649
00:56:35,129 --> 00:56:36,264
3.

650
00:56:40,400 --> 00:56:41,602
Fuck yes!

651
00:56:41,969 --> 00:56:43,070
Fuck yes.

652
00:57:10,064 --> 00:57:12,767
Meat lovers.

653
00:57:51,238 --> 00:57:53,473
Wild Bills!

654
00:57:56,610 --> 00:57:58,179
Pizza!

655
00:58:10,291 --> 00:58:11,892
Another day.

656
00:58:12,226 --> 00:58:14,228
Another cream pie.

657
00:58:25,973 --> 00:58:29,610
Let's make this more
interesting.

658
00:58:29,977 --> 00:58:31,612
Yeah.

659
00:58:53,467 --> 00:58:54,869
Wow.

660
00:58:56,537 --> 00:58:57,905
Yep.

661
00:59:36,877 --> 00:59:38,913
Let's change subjects.

662
00:59:39,046 --> 00:59:40,748
This one starts on
the other side of town

663
00:59:40,881 --> 00:59:43,684
with a group of poker
playing mobsters.

664
00:59:43,818 --> 00:59:47,621
Set up you've seen
1000 times before.

665
00:59:48,189 --> 00:59:49,757
Only this.

666
00:59:49,890 --> 00:59:51,258
Has a twist.

667
01:00:06,841 --> 01:00:09,777
Oh, oh, oh I got one,
I got a good one.

668
01:00:09,910 --> 01:00:12,179
Why do Italian men grow
mustaches?

669
01:00:12,313 --> 01:00:13,347
Uh.

670
01:00:14,281 --> 01:00:15,850
So they could look
like their mother!

671
01:00:20,221 --> 01:00:23,290
Their mother!
Their mother!

672
01:00:24,458 --> 01:00:26,327
Hey! You know, Tony.

673
01:00:29,531 --> 01:00:31,265
I mean, I'd fuck your mother!

674
01:00:48,550 --> 01:00:51,152
You want to fuck my mother?

675
01:00:54,388 --> 01:00:56,924
Tony it's just joke.

676
01:00:57,592 --> 01:01:01,362
Yeah, it's a goof.

677
01:01:13,274 --> 01:01:14,784
You son of a bitch,
you just see your face.

678
01:01:14,808 --> 01:01:15,843
I got you.

679
01:01:29,890 --> 01:01:32,326
Oh my God, Tony!

680
01:01:32,760 --> 01:01:34,028
Yeah man.

681
01:01:34,428 --> 01:01:36,397
Nearly shit myself.

682
01:01:36,598 --> 01:01:38,299
Almost shit my fucking pants.

683
01:01:39,967 --> 01:01:41,368
Oh my God Tony.

684
01:01:41,969 --> 01:01:45,372
Could a given me a heart attack!

685
01:01:45,507 --> 01:01:46,675
Holy shit.

686
01:01:46,807 --> 01:01:47,841
Whoo.

687
01:01:58,852 --> 01:02:00,522
What the fuck!?

688
01:02:00,655 --> 01:02:02,356
You little shit.

689
01:02:20,975 --> 01:02:22,810
What are you guys doing?!

690
01:02:24,579 --> 01:02:26,715
Get in there.

691
01:02:26,847 --> 01:02:27,847
Come on, get in.

692
01:02:51,839 --> 01:02:53,173
Oh.

693
01:02:56,143 --> 01:02:57,579
Hey!

694
01:02:57,811 --> 01:02:59,046
Hey guys!

695
01:02:59,480 --> 01:03:00,515
Tony!

696
01:03:01,882 --> 01:03:03,117
Tony!

697
01:03:24,405 --> 01:03:27,374
Get up, let's go.

698
01:03:32,547 --> 01:03:33,581
Get up.

699
01:03:37,151 --> 01:03:39,053
Hey!

700
01:03:39,386 --> 01:03:41,188
Carmine.

701
01:03:41,989 --> 01:03:43,390
How you doing?

702
01:03:43,692 --> 01:03:45,426
Hey Carmine.

703
01:03:45,560 --> 01:03:49,463
How you feeling you doing OK?
- Guys a...

704
01:03:49,597 --> 01:03:51,165
Fucking legend.

705
01:03:52,333 --> 01:03:56,203
She giving you a grape juice
every day?

706
01:03:57,371 --> 01:04:01,375
Drinks more juice than
Sammy fucking Sosa.

707
01:04:01,509 --> 01:04:05,379
Hey ma, you remember Tutti,
don't you?

708
01:04:05,747 --> 01:04:06,847
Yeah.

709
01:04:07,214 --> 01:04:09,183
Hi boys, Tutti.

710
01:04:11,720 --> 01:04:13,987
Are you staying out of trouble?

711
01:04:14,121 --> 01:04:15,456
Wish we were.

712
01:04:15,590 --> 01:04:17,891
Actually Tutti he said he
wanted to fuck you Ma.

713
01:04:18,025 --> 01:04:20,094
Ain't that right?
Tell her.

714
01:04:20,227 --> 01:04:23,397
Tony come on this is
real fucked up.

715
01:04:23,531 --> 01:04:27,301
I'm going to get-
- You ain't going nowhere.

716
01:04:27,434 --> 01:04:30,070
Is that right Tutti?

717
01:04:30,204 --> 01:04:32,940
You wanna pound me Tutti?

718
01:04:34,141 --> 01:04:36,276
Ah don't be shy today,
just about an hour ago

719
01:04:36,410 --> 01:04:37,945
you said that you wanted

01:06:17,912 --> 01:06:19,079
Oh yeah.

753
01:06:19,213 --> 01:06:21,482
Last week I went on
a date with...

754
01:06:21,616 --> 01:06:23,952
- a blind guy.
- Ohh! A blind, really?

755
01:06:24,084 --> 01:06:26,754
- It was a blind date literally yeah.

756
01:06:26,888 --> 01:06:28,188
Yeah.

757
01:06:28,322 --> 01:06:30,266
I mean, obviously
there's nothing wrong with that,

758
01:06:30,290 --> 01:06:33,761
but give a girl a heads up like
tell me, your tell me you're blind.

759
01:06:33,895 --> 01:06:35,996
Could have shot you a text
or something right?

760
01:06:36,129 --> 01:06:37,799

761
01:06:38,065 --> 01:06:40,902
He couldn't. I don't know do

762
01:06:41,034 --> 01:06:42,469
God, I don't know.

763
01:06:42,604 --> 01:06:45,372
I've never thought of that.
- No idea how that works.

764
01:06:45,507 --> 01:06:49,176
Guess I'll never find out because
I let him to go after the first date.

765
01:06:49,309 --> 01:06:50,612
Oh yeah, yeah,

766
01:06:50,745 --> 01:06:52,385

767
01:06:54,147 --> 01:06:55,415
Right?

768
01:06:55,717 --> 01:06:57,952
God, you're so bad.

769
01:07:02,155 --> 01:07:03,290
All right,

770
01:07:03,490 --> 01:07:05,727

771
01:07:06,694 --> 01:07:08,395
Little bumpski.

772
01:07:09,931 --> 01:07:11,733
Yeah, OK, sure I like cocaine.

773
01:07:13,768 --> 01:07:15,513
- Alright she's a part girl, I guess.
- Yeah, yeah, just be careful.

774
01:07:15,537 --> 01:07:18,438
Don't draw attention to it.

775
01:07:22,342 --> 01:07:24,044
Oh well, that'll put
hair on your chest.

776
01:07:24,177 --> 01:07:26,657
- Sure will.
- Just when I thought you couldn't get any cooler.

777
01:07:27,749 --> 01:07:28,616
Aww...

778
01:07:28,750 --> 01:07:31,786
You just snorted my dad's ashes.

779
01:07:35,557 --> 01:07:36,557
What?

780
01:07:36,624 --> 01:07:37,692
Mmmm.

781
01:07:37,825 --> 01:07:40,028
I said you just snorted
my dad's ashes,

782
01:07:40,160 --> 01:07:43,598
So that is what you said, right?
I'm not...

783
01:07:43,731 --> 01:07:46,901
Is that the joke name you call
cocaine, are you playing with me?

784
01:07:47,035 --> 01:07:48,736
No actual ashes.

785
01:07:50,404 --> 01:07:52,941
I got-'em from the crematorium.

786
01:07:53,073 --> 01:07:56,276
On Saint Clair Street.
- What the fuck are you talking about?

787
01:07:56,410 --> 01:07:57,712
Oh it's nothing.

788
01:07:57,845 --> 01:07:59,547
It's just that you snorted
my dad's ashes.

789
01:07:59,681 --> 01:08:01,148
That's not nothing, sweetheart,

790
01:08:01,281 --> 01:08:03,618

throat right now.

791
01:08:03,751 --> 01:08:06,486
Dude, I feel that.
- Well that's so great.

792
01:08:06,621 --> 01:08:09,724
I'm so glad.
- It isn't that great.

793
01:08:09,857 --> 01:08:11,325
It sucks.

794
01:08:11,793 --> 01:08:13,393
You are so cute.

795
01:08:14,629 --> 01:08:16,296
Is your hair naturally curly?

796
01:08:16,430 --> 01:08:19,099
OK, you're a psycho, right?

797
01:08:19,701 --> 01:08:21,669
Psycho about you.

798
01:08:21,803 --> 01:08:23,270

804
01:08:46,794 --> 01:08:49,831
Oh my gosh Oh my gosh
I have to wake up early.

805
01:08:49,964 --> 01:08:51,465

Ugh, that's the worst.

808
01:08:56,070 --> 01:08:58,616
Well, maybe Saturday night we could
do something if you're not doing anything.

809
01:08:58,640 --> 01:09:00,207

810
01:09:00,340 --> 01:09:03,678

Excuse me, do you happen

814
01:09:12,854 --> 01:09:13,721
Yup.

815
01:09:13,855 --> 01:09:16,924

816
01:09:17,959 --> 01:09:19,259
OK.

817
01:09:28,002 --> 01:09:29,369
You want your milk in the bag?

818
01:09:29,503 --> 01:09:31,171
No, I think the carton
will be okay.

819
01:09:33,306 --> 01:09:39,312
Oh, I'm sorry,

820
01:09:41,281 --> 01:09:43,851
Would you like to try our new
"Java Rama" coffee fountain?

821
01:09:43,985 --> 01:09:45,787
It comes with five
different bold flavors that

822
01:09:45,920 --> 01:09:47,822
will make you start
the day like a savage.

823
01:09:47,955 --> 01:09:50,558
No, I think black's going to be
okay, but don't worry,

824
01:09:50,692 --> 01:09:53,061
I'm not driving or anything.

825
01:09:53,193 --> 01:09:54,796
Oh I did it again.

826
01:10:05,640 --> 01:10:07,875

01:14:06,446 --> 01:14:07,782
Hey.

Hmm.

865
01:14:17,591 --> 01:14:21,762
I think I just asked you
a question, Missy.

866
01:14:25,433 --> 01:14:27,268
Daddy, you're home early.

867
01:14:27,401 --> 01:14:30,604

neighborhood here, okay?

872
01:14:41,415 --> 01:14:42,883

873
01:14:43,250 --> 01:14:46,787
But I'm chilly!
- Hey there chilly, I'm dad. God, help me!

874
01:14:51,125 --> 01:14:52,560
You're so funny.

875

You got to start answering some
questions, OK? Cause I'm...

876
01:14:55,329 --> 01:14:57,999
You know, I've lost it fully and

877
01:14:58,132 --> 01:15:02,169

878
01:15:02,303 --> 01:15:03,637
Oh.

So unfair!

884
01:15:17,752 --> 01:15:19,920
I didn't do anything.

885
01:15:34,435 --> 01:15:36,237
Yeah, like that.

886
01:16:19,713 --> 01:16:21,882
It's our song Daddy!
