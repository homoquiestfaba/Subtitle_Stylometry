3
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I liked how when they sang
"Everything got really smooth."

4
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Oh, wait, wait, wait.
Hold on.

5
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Dianne, I got
an extra one.

6
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Can you save it
so I can give it to Julia?

7
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Oh, yeah. Good idea.

8
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
She'll like that.

9
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Yeah.

10
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Let's get a cab.

11
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Oh.

12
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Evening.
Hi.

13
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Hi. You free?

14
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Yes, ma'am.

15
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
( horn blares, tires squeal )

16
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Amy!

17
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
MAN ( over radio):
Aphrodite, Aphrodite.

18
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
This is the marine operator

19
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,000
for Captain Mark McCune.

20
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
McCune aboard the Aphrodite.

21
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
I've got the emergency room

22
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
at San Francisco
County Hospital.

23
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
They're asking if you know
a Dianne Parker.

24
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Taxi!

25
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
MARK:
Hello? Excuse me.

26
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Hello?

27
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Hello.
Hi.

28
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Hi. I'm looking
for Parker.

29
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Oh, it's Dianne. Dianne Parker.

30
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Can I help you?

31
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Uh, yeah. You have a playhouse
for my brother, Dr. McCune.

32
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Oh, yeah.

33
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
So just tell David
to call me.

34
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I'll come by his office
and put it together for him.

35
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
What's wrong with now?

36
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
I'll help you.

37
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Then you can say thanks;
I'll say, "Forget about it.

38
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Have dinner with me
on my yacht."

39
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
You'll say,
"Sure. Why not?"

40
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
See? I give you the easy part.

41
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
I say, "Sure. Why not?"

42
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
You don't even know me.

43
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
I know you're strong
and you work hard

44
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
and you're not afraid
to get your clothes dirty.

45
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
You're not dating my brother,
are you?

46
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
No. we're friends.

47
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:03,000
He can chaperone
if you're scared.

48
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
( knock on door )

49
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Sailor boy's unloading
the playhouse.

50
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Okay.

51
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
That girl's come, too.

52
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Dianne's here?

53
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
MARK:
It's very simple.

54
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Watch me. Watch me.

55
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Like this, all right?

56
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Wait, wait, wait.

57
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Then fold it back.

58
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Come on. Come on.
Keep up with the master.

59
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Here, use a clean one.

60
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
No. No do-overs.

61
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Just fold it
back like this.

62
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Where did you learn
how to do this?

63
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Some old guy
in a Chinese
opium den.

64
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
You've been to China?

65
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
I've been everywhere.

66
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Ooh, Tales from the sea.

67
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Take him with a grain of salt,
please.

68
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
MARK:
All right.

69
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Miss Piggot, my
seventh-grade art
teacher had me

70
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
stay after school
and make 50 of these.

71
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
It was my punishment.

72
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
For what?

73
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
You don't want to know.

74
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
You won't like me anymore.

75
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Who says I like you now?

76
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Come on. You tell me.

77
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
He was too busy

78
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
running for student
council president.

79
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
He doesn't remember.

80
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Treasurer.
I was running for treasurer.

81
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Well, I was running for my life.

82
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
You got sauce on your chin.

83
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Thanks.

84
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
There you go.

85
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
( tittering )

86
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
MARK:
Thank you.

87
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Sure.

88
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
( laughs )

89
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
MARK:
That's Orion.

90
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Canis Major.

91
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Taurus.

92
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:23,000
My mother, she painted them
on her bedroom ceiling.

93
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
You never talk
about her.

94
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Nothing to talk about.

95
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
( crickets chirping )

96
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
( sighs )

97
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:42,000
It took two years.

98
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
I hated the hospital.

99
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
I... stopped going.

100
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
David, he was,
he was the hero.

101
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
He held her hand.

102
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
You were 12.

103
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,000
No, he kept asking me
to come with him.

104
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Said she wanted to see me.

105
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Say good-bye.

106
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
I don't beat
myself up about it.

107
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Mothers aren't
supposed to die.

108
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
You had every right
to be angry.

109
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,000
She understood.

110
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
She knew you loved her.

111
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,000
How do you do that?

112
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Make me feel like
you've known me
all my life?

113
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Maybe we're soul mates.

114
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,000
You make
everything perfect.

115
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
I mean it.

116
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,000
I need you.

117
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
I love you.

118
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
( car horn honking )

119
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,000
David! David!

120
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
She said yes!

121
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
She said yes!

122
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
We're getting married!

123
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Come on.
Say something, David.

124
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Come on.
Say something.

125
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Congratulations.

126
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
He's jealous.

127
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
No. No, that's great.
I didn't...

128
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Congratulations.

129
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Thank you.

130
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
That's wonderful.

131
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Mmm... mmm!

132
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Oh, everyone in the world
is jealous of me right now.

133
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Good morning,
Mr. Fisherman.

134
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Good morning,
Mrs. Fisherman.

135
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Oh, don't get lost
out there, okay?

136
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
I can't get lost.

137
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
What do you think
the stars are for?

138
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:05,000
God never figured
we'd invent a compass.

139
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
If you need directions,
just follow the stars.

140
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Besides, I'll always
come home to you.

141
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Me and the kids?

142
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Kids?

143
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Well, one, for starters.

144
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Woo!

145
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Come here!

146
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Oh!

147
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
( laughing )

148
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Wow!

149
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
This... mmm!

150
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Hi.

151
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Hi. You seen my mom?

152
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
She's over in the stacks.

153
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
What are you
doing here?

154
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
( whispering )

155
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
What?

156
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
No!

157
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
( laughing )

158
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Oh, my!

159
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
You're lucky you're over
morning sickness.

160
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,000
So did you have morning
sickness with me?

161
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Morning, afternoon
and evening.

162
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
You must be
having a boy.

163
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Old wives tale.

164
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
You going to eat this?

165
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
No. I think you are.

166
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Well...

167
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,000
how much weight
did you gain?

168
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Oh, when you start running
after Mark Jr

169
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
it'll melt right off you.

170
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
No. If we have a boy

171
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
we're naming
him after Dad.

172
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
You are?
Mm-hmm.

173
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Well, thank you, sweetheart.

174
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
He'd like that.

175
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
I'm sorry.

176
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
I didn't mean
to make you sad.

177
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Oh, no.

178
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,000
I was just remembering
when you were born.

179
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,000
I held you in my arms

180
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,000
and suddenly this wave
of terror came over me.

181
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
( chuckles )

182
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Here I was holding
this complete stranger.

183
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
How much should I feed you?

184
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
What if you wouldn't
stop crying?

185
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Uh, suppose you hated me?

186
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Your dad came over to me
and he said... bless his heart...

187
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,000
"Hannah, give her to me."

188
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
And suddenly I knew
I didn't want to let you go.

189
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,000
You were mine.

190
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:14,000
We have a lot of books
about motherhood at the library

191
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,000
but none of them can prepare you
for that moment...

192
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:21,000
when you give your heart
to your child.

193
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
( gasps )

194
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Oh!

195
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
( laughs )

196
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
What is it?

197
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
He kicked.
He kicked.

198
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
What?

199
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Oh, my!

200
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,000
I think he's going
to be a football player.

201
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Just now. That was
the first kick.

202
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Well, maybe

203
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
soccer, at least.

204
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
( laughing )

205
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Please, don't cry,
okay?

206
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,000
It's going
to be okay.

207
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
We'll figure it out.

208
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
It'll be okay.

209
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
It's not going
to be okay.

210
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
( crying )

211
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Okay.

212
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Listen...

213
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Dianne, we'll...
we'll have a baby.

214
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
We'll have lots
of babies.

215
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Just not now.

216
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
I want this baby.

217
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Did you not understand
what Dr. Ellis was saying?

218
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
I don't care.

219
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
A baby who can't
walk or talk.

220
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:38,000
A baby who's
going to die.

221
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Listen to me.

222
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Dianne...

223
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,000
I can't deal with this.

224
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Hey.

225
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Genetic abnormalities.

226
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Neurological damage.

227
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Here, you went
to med school.

228
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Did you take
a second test?

229
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
You're looking
at it.

230
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Sorry.

231
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
How's Dianne?

232
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,000
She wants to have this baby.

233
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
You have to help me.

234
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Explain it to her.

235
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Tell her that it's
not fair to the baby.

236
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
This is between you and her.

237
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
You're a doctor.
She'll listen to you.

238
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Mark, I cannot tell someone
to terminate a pregnancy.

239
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Forget your hypocritical oaths
and ethics.

240
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
What if this was your baby?

241
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Come on, David, be honest.

242
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
I don't know.

243
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
You know what you would do.

244
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Anybody home?

245
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Mark?

246
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Dianne?

247
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Mark's not here.

248
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:48,000
He left last night.

249
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
He'll be back.

250
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
He's scared.

251
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
I'm scared, too.

252
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
He showed me
the test results.

253
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,000
I made some calls.

254
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:12,000
The spine and the nervous system
are damaged.

255
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,000
There's fluid in the brain.

256
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Your baby won't walk
or have normal speech.

257
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:34,000
If the heart and lungs
don't develop

258
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,000
they won't support
the body's growth.

259
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
This research expert
I spoke to said

260
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:43,000
he's seen cases like this
survive up to six years.

261
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Don't tell me
not to have her.

262
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
I won't.

263
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,000
I mean, that's not
why I'm here.

264
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:52,000
She'll probably need
to undergo some surgery.

265
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
She'll need good care.

266
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,000
I'll be her doctor
if you want.

267
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Will she be in pain?

268
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
I'll help you.

269
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:13,000
I'll help you take care of her
if you want to do this.

270
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Mark!

271
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Dianne!

272
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Dianne!

273
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Grab my hand!

274
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Mark!

275
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Dianne!

276
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:46,000
( voice echoing ):
Help!

277
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,000
( child crying )

278
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Julia, I'm coming.

279
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
I'm coming.

280
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
What is it, sweetie?

281
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Oh, what is it?

282
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Does it hurt?

283
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
Do you have a cramp?

284
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Do you want me to rub it?

285
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
You want me
to rub your tummy?

286
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Oh, shh, shh.

287
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
I know, I know.

288
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Did you have a bad dream?

289
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Oh, I know, I know.

290
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:25,000
( clock chimes three times )

291
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Is Julia all right?

292
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Oh, yeah, she's fine.

293
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Sweetheart,
you look terrible.

294
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Go back to bed.

295
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
You're sick?

296
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
No. I just had
a bad dream.

297
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Maybe Julia
had one, too.

298
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,000
I hate when
she's scared.

299
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,000
I don't know
how to tell her
it's just a dream.

300
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Oh, she knows.

301
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
I dreamt about Mark.

302
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,000
He was drowning;
I couldn't save him.

303
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Good.

304
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Forgive us our trespasses, Mom.

305
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
I forgave that
louse years ago.

306
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
I'm not the one
having nightmares.

307
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,000
You can't help what you dream.

308
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
Forgive and you'll forget.

309
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Five years is a long time

310
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,000
to hold out hope
for an ex-husband.

311
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Or carry a grudge.

312
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Or both.

313
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Six. Six years
in August.

314
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Yeah, but who's counting?

315
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Not Mark.

316
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
He still sends you

317
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
a check every month.

318
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Yeah, but that's
because he knows

319
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
I'm going to send it right back.

320
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
It's his conscience cleaner.

321
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
It's his opening gambit

322
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
and you keep
the conversation going.

323
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Why don't you
just rip it up

324
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
instead of mailing it
back to him?

325
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
You're right.

326
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Next time I will.

327
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
( toy piano tinkling )

328
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
JULIA:
Ma...

329
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
DIANNE:
I think Grandma has one
of these somewhere.

330
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,000
We haven't seen it
in a while, have we?

331
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,000
That's red...

332
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:02,000
and maybe that one's...

333
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,000
that's more
brown than red.

334
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
And orange.

335
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Ma...

336
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
What's she got?

337
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Nothing.

338
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
We're just here
for a checkup.

339
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,000
What have you got?

340
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Nothing.

341
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
I feed the fish

342
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
and take out the bloaters
for Martha.

343
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
She freaks out
if there's any bloaters.

344
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,000
There always are.

345
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:30,000
There we go. Good.

346
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Heart sounds good.

347
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
Lungs, too.

348
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
Good.
Get out.

349
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,000
I have
sick people waiting.

350
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,000
Hear that? He's
kicking us out.

351
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
We're too healthy.

352
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
I didn't say
you looked healthy.

353
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Don't even
start with me,
Uncle David.

354
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
We're having
a good day.

355
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
Looks like
you need a break.

356
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
You look tired.

357
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
It's your
fluorescent
lighting.

358
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:00,000
Say "hasta la
bye-bye,
Uncle David."

359
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
Seriously, Dianne.

360
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
Seriously, stop.

361
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
Look, I moved in
with my mom.

362
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
She's retiring
just to be
with Julia.

363
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,000
We're fine.

364
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
( sighs )

365
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,000
Didn't mean
to bite your head off.

366
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:18,000
I have that effect on women.

367
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
Good-bye, sweetie.

368
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,000
Da...

369
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
Okay.

370
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Thank you.

371
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,000
All right?

372
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,000
Mm-hmm.

373
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,000
Okay, let's see
what we have here.

374
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:44,000
Oh, Julia, you won't believe
there's starfish in here.

375
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
Can I get you one?

376
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
Okay, I've got one.

377
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,000
Ooh, look at that.

378
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
Gosh, look at that.

379
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
Look at the feet.

380
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,000
Kind of drippy.

381
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
Cool.

382
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
All the little tentacles.

383
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,000
That's where
it sucks in...

384
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
Dianne!

385
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:29,000
Hey!

386
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,000
Starfish.

387
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
Okay.

388
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
Hey, you
want a ride?

389
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
I can walk home.

390
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
Anybody who cleans
out that tank
deserves a ride.

391
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
Come on.

392
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
Got any plans
for the summer?

393
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
Mrs. Sobel says
I need a summer job.

394
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
I told her
I'd feed your fish

395
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,000
but she said
that wasn't enough.

396
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
Who's Mrs. Sobel?

397
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,000
The case worker.

398
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,000
I hate her.

399
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:57,000
Ever think about
being a mother's helper?

400
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,000
You like kids?

401
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,000
Well, that depends.

402
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
You can't just
"like kids."

403
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,000
They're all different.

404
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,000
No one ever says,
"So, do you like adults?"

405
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,000
Touche.

406
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
What does that mean?

407
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
It means you win.

408
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
You got me.
It's a fencing term.

409
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,000
It's French.

410
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,000
Well.

411
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:20,000
( train whistle blowing )

412
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,000
Is someone home?

413
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
My mom is.

414
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
( rock music playing )

415
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
And boyfriend Bud.

416
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,000
Thanks for the ride.

417
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,000
Okay. See ya.

418
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
"Farewell, cow,
and farewell, cat

419
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:54,000
"rabbit, tiger,
sullen rat.

420
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,000
"To our children
we shall say

421
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
"how we walked
the Milky Way.

422
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
"You whose journeys
now begin

423
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:02,000
"if you reach
a lovely inn

424
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
"if a rabbit
makes your bed

425
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:07,000
"if two dragons
bake your bread

426
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:10,000
"rest a little
for my sake

427
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
and give my love
to William Blake."

428
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:16,000
That's a good
story, huh?

429
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,000
( door opens )

430
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:20,000
Did you ask David
to dinner?

431
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,000
Oh, I forgot.

432
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,000
Dianne.

433
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
What? I forgot.

434
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,000
I'll call him.

435
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
No, Mom, please.

436
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
Do you want me to stop
having nightmares?

437
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,000
David reminds me
of Mark.

438
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,000
Every time.

439
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,000
Apples and oranges.

440
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
Something about
his voice... it's...

441
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,000
David's voice
is much deeper.

442
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
It's exactly the same.

443
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
All right, I will...

444
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
( sighs )

445
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:46,000
I could use a little help here.

446
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:58,000
( dog yelping and whining )

447
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:06,000
BUDDY:
Stop whining,
you worthless mutt!

448
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:09,000
( yelping and whining continue)
Come here!

449
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
All right, that's it!
That's it!

450
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
Get in there!

451
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
You let him out.

452
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
What did I tell you, Amy?

453
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:23,000
I'm sorry.
I thought he needed exercise.

454
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
If you want a dog
to obey

455
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
first you got to break him.

456
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,000
Do you hear me?!

457
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
( whining
and yelping )

458
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:33,000
The whole neighborhood
can hear you.

459
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:36,000
Hey, Amy Beth.

460
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
Where'd you put
my cigarettes?

461
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:41,000
You told me not to buy you any,
remember?

462
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,000
You wanted to quit.

463
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
( laughs )

464
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
I'll go.

465
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
We're out of hot sauce, anyway.

466
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
Oh, cookie face

467
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:58,000
don't be gloomy.

468
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:01,000
Buddy's fun.

469
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
He doesn't like me.

470
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
Don't be silly.

471
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
He loves you.

472
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
And don't be mad.

473
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
Go to bed... you got
school tomorrow.

474
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,000
School's out
for the summer.

475
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:15,000
It's over.

476
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:18,000
You had moving up ceremony?

477
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
Oh, I wanted to come.

478
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,000
Why didn't you tell me?

479
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
I did.

480
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,000
No, you didn't.

481
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
You did? Did you?

482
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,000
It wasn't anything.

483
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
It was just a stupid assembly.

484
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,000
It doesn't matter.

485
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
I'm not mad.

486
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:45,000
Oh... hug me.

487
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:48,000
Oh, I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.

488
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:51,000
I'm so sorry.
I'm sorry.

489
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
( electronic whirring )

490
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,000
( car horn honks )

491
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:29,000
( car doors opening )

492
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
David.

493
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,000
Hey.

494
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:38,000
Hi.

495
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:42,000
Uh... Dianne,
this is Amy Williams.

496
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,000
I know Amy.

497
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000
You fish out the bloaters
for Martha, right?

498
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:48,000
Right.
Amy's looking
for a summer job.

499
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:51,000
Oh, that's great...
did you check the bulletin board

500
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,000
at the rec center?

501
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:55,000
Actually, I told her
you were looking for
a mother's helper.

502
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
Oh.

503
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
Where's Julia?

504
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:03,000
She's sleeping.

505
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,000
Would you like some lemonade?

506
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,000
Let me give you a hand.

507
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
You can have
your lemonade

508
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
and then you can
get on your horse, cowboy.

509
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
I told you, I don't
need help with Julia.

510
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,000
Especially not
from a 12-year-old.

511
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,000
She's a good kid.

512
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,000
She's having some
trouble at home.

513
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:24,000
She remembered Julia.
She wanted to come.

514
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:28,000
Why? So she can tell
her friends at school?

515
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
I remember her, you know,
from the waiting room.

516
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,000
Well, Julia seems to like her.

517
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:34,000
She's awake.
They're having a little chat.

518
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
You like my watch?

519
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
It was my dad's.

520
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,000
It was being fixed
at the jewelers

521
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
the day his ship went down.

522
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,000
It glows in the dark, see?

523
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
Ma...

524
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,000
It's okay...
she's making lemonade.

525
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
She'll be right back.

526
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:52,000
It's a guy's watch,
but I don't care.

527
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
I've had it
six years now.

528
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
It's waterproof...
I even wear it in the shower.

529
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,000
Hear it?

530
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,000
JULIA:
Mee...

531
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,000
You want to wear it
while I'm here?

532
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,000
Oh, be careful.

533
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:05,000
It's too big... it might
fall off and break.

534
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:09,000
Oh... look at your
little wrists.

535
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,000
Your mom's right.

536
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
You can buy her
a kid's watch

537
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:15,000
at the drugstore
with different color straps.

538
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,000
Yeah, I've seen those.

539
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,000
Ba...

540
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,000
They don't have blue.

541
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
Yellow, red or green.

542
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
( whispering ):
Get yellow.

543
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
Can I push her chair out?

544
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,000
Okay.

545
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:31,000
Here comes the bump.

546
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,000
( both laughing )
Did you like that?

547
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
Did your stomach
flip up?

548
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
Want to do it
again? Okay.

549
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:41,000
Whoo! Was that fun?

550
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,000
She really likes that.

551
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
Yeah.

552
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
( seagulls crying )

553
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,000
Mee...

554
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
That's my name...

555
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
don't wear it out.

556
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:19,000
Do you want to
trade hats? Here.

557
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:28,000
Oh, you look pretty.

558
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
Here.

559
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
You like that?

560
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:37,000
Do I look good?

561
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
"Mee" is "Amy"?

562
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,000
Uh-huh.

563
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:48,000
Girls at school trade
clothes all the time.

564
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
I don't trade with
anybody, though.

565
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
Do you like school?

566
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
It's okay. I like math.

567
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,000
Mmm.

568
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,000
Do you go to dances?

569
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:59,000
Ugh. Boys in my
grade can't dance.

570
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
Now, my dad was
a good dancer.

571
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:04,000
He drowned when I was six.

572
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:07,000
My dad died when I was 17.

573
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:10,000
It hurts in my chest
when I think about him.

574
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
Does it hurt in your chest?

575
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:16,000
Big-time.

576
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:20,000
Him and my mom won a dance
contest together once.

577
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:23,000
We had a picture of it,
but my mom took it down.

578
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,000
Yeah. Sometimes
it's hard to look

579
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
at old photographs, you know?

580
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:29,000
Is that why you don't have
any of Julia's dad?

581
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,000
Did he drown?

582
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:36,000
No. He just doesn't
live with us anymore.

583
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,000
Thanks.

584
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:40,000
You should get some
pictures for Julia.

585
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
So she knows what
he looks like.

586
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,000
Hmm.

587
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:46,000
Sometimes I can't remember
my dad's face

588
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
and it scares me.

589
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:51,000
'Cause I'm going to grow up
and look different

590
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,000
and he won't know me in heaven.

591
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,000
And what if I don't
recognize him?

592
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:02,000
Mmm. So, got a boyfriend?

593
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,000
No.

594
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,000
Lucky. My mom's got one.

595
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,000
He thinks he can sing.

596
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,000
( laughs )

597
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:13,000
Julia and Amy
traded hats.

598
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,000
Amy says all
the girls at school

599
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,000
trade clothes
with their friends.

600
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,000
Julia has a friend.

601
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,000
Talked to Martha.

602
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
David's got the flu.

603
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
My reading group's
coming over.

604
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
Otherwise I'd deliver
this myself.

605
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
Well, Ma, he doesn't
need your soup.
Dianne...

606
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:41,000
Trust me, I'm sure
the Single Mother
Brigade is on duty.

607
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,000
I'm sure he's
drowning in soup.

608
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:46,000
And brownies
and hand-knitted socks.

609
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,000
Do you remember
his address

610
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,000
or should I write
it down for you?

611
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
David?

612
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,000
David?

613
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:34,000
( coughing )

614
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
Dianne?

615
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,000
( yells )

616
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,000
( laughing ):
Oh, I'm sorry.

617
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,000
You scared me.

618
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,000
Uh, the door
was unlocked

619
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,000
so I let myself in.

620
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
She'd kill me
if I came back with it.

621
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
What? With what?

622
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,000
Oh, the chicken soup.

623
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,000
Martha said you came home
with the flu.

624
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,000
Go back to sleep.

625
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:31,000
Oh, and, um...
these are your glasses.

626
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,000
I took them off.

627
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,000
So, it's on the stove.

628
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,000
The soup.

629
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,000
Thank you.

630
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,000
What is it?

631
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:06,000
Don't ever send me
to his house again.

632
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:17,000
Sorry.

633
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
This is your temporary card.

634
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,000
Just sign the back.

635
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,000
Now you can
check out a book.

636
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
I think Julia
wants one, too.

637
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
Absolutely.

638
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
Julia, you should have
a library card, too.

639
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,000
Will you sign your name?

640
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,000
Amy's going to help you
sign your name.

641
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,000
J...

642
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:05,000
BOTH:
U-L-I-A.

643
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,000
Julia.
Look.

644
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,000
Now you have a library
card just like Amy.

645
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,000
Let me take that for you.

646
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
There you go.
See?

647
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
Mom...

648
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:17,000
Mom, got you a book
with my own card.

649
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,000
Oh... baby...

650
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:22,000
I've got one of my headaches...
a really bad one.

651
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,000
Sorry.

652
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,000
Look... Agatha Christie.

653
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,000
Hannah says she's
really famous.

654
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
She's written a
million mysteries.

655
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:31,000
And Hannah's read
every one, I bet.

656
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:36,000
Oh... oh,
don't do that.

657
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
You can't sleep...
it's afternoon.

658
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
Get up. Get dressed.

659
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,000
Oh! Ooh...

660
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,000
Mom?

661
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,000
Mom?

662
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:54,000
It was all my fault.

663
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:07,000
( Julia crying )

664
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
( gasping )

665
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:17,000
( quietly ):
Amy, I'm here.

666
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,000
Okay...

667
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
Come on, David,
pick up.

668
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:29,000
Please pick up.

669
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,000
She seems stable.

670
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
You can call me in the
morning if you want.

671
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
This was a bad one.

672
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
It was like she couldn't
catch her breath

673
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
you know, like
she'd been running.

674
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:19,000
Her lungs are small,
you know that.

675
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:20,000
She's growing,
and they're not.

676
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:23,000
I used to pray
for her to grow.

677
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,000
When she was born,
she was so tiny.

678
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,000
I was afraid to touch her
after the surgery, you know?

679
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:30,000
I just knew I was hurting her
every time I picked her up.

680
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
I remember talking
out loud to myself...

681
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:37,000
shouting, really...
usually at Mark.

682
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:40,000
Now I just... want her
to stay the same size

683
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:43,000
and not grow an inch.

684
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,000
What about Mark?

685
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,000
I don't think
about Mark anymore.

686
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:55,000
I'm sorry I made you
come out in the rain.

687
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,000
( thunder rumbling in distance)

688
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,000
Don't be afraid
to call me again tonight.

689
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,000
Okay, thanks.

690
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,000
And try to get
some sleep yourself.

691
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,000
All right. Good night.

692
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,000
Okay.

693
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,000
Julia wants
her Christmas rabbit

694
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:12,000
but I can't find it.

695
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,000
Her Christmas rabbit?

696
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,000
You gave it to her.

697
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:16,000
With the red top hat

698
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,000
and the bell.

699
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:20,000
Wha... That was
three years ago.

700
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:23,000
Well, she wants it.

701
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:27,000
Oh, my, I think it got lost
in between hospital visits.

702
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:30,000
Okay, I'll tell her.

703
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
Did you tell her
about the rabbit?

704
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:35,000
No. I didn't even remember
that rabbit until she

705
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:36,000
mentioned the top hat.

706
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:39,000
Someone must
have mentioned it.

707
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,000
Keep the tiger there.

708
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:50,000
You like the doggy?

709
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
Want to keep him
here with you?

710
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,000
Let's do a rhythm strip.

711
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:02,000
We did one
two weeks ago.

712
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:03,000
Yeah, I know.

713
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:06,000
That little click
every ten heartbeats or so

714
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,000
seems a little more
frequent now.

715
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,000
It might mean nothing

716
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,000
but I'm going to do a strip
and send it to Kaplan

717
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,000
see if he wants
to do an echo.

718
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,000
It may be nothing,
believe me.

719
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,000
I... am an old woman
kind of guy.

720
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,000
I check the locks
on every door.

721
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:22,000
David, tell me the truth.

722
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
The truth is the same
as it's always been.

723
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:27,000
She's surprised us too often
for me and Kaplan

724
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,000
to have a timetable.

725
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:32,000
I know that's hard.

726
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:36,000
( rhythmic beeps )

727
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,000
Good.

728
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
Maaaa.

729
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:50,000
Here you go.

730
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:51,000
Mmm, thanks.

731
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:52,000
Hmm.

732
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,000
( sighs contentedly )

733
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:57,000
Amy left this on my desk
at the library.

734
00:42:57,000 --> 00:43:00,000
"I learned a word,
it's "serendipity.

735
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,000
"When you say it,
it sounds skippity.

736
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,000
"Light and airy,
just by chance

737
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:08,000
a breeze that makes
the flowers dance."

738
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:09,000
"Skippity."

739
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:10,000
It's nice, huh?

740
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,000
I like that.

741
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:17,000
Hmm...

742
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:20,000
Amy is what I imagine
Julia would be like.

743
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:23,000
Smart... messy and awkward,
you know?

744
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:26,000
Full of questions.

745
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:29,000
( sighs )

746
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:34,000
I had so many plans
when I got married.

747
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:37,000
You sound like your life has
been folded up and put away.

748
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:38,000
But it's not over.

749
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:44,000
The carnival opened
in Blair County.

750
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,000
You know, Amy's never been.

751
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:47,000
We should take the girls.

752
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,000
Oh, it's two hours away.

753
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:50,000
Thursday's my last day
at the library.

754
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:53,000
We could go Friday afternoon
and avoid the traffic.

755
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,000
All right.

756
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,000
I know you made us
promise no fuss

757
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:03,000
but this doesn't
feel right.

758
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:05,000
Well, you'll
get your chance

759
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:06,000
at the Book Lovers Ball.

760
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,000
You can make as many
speeches as you want.

761
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,000
I'll play the fool
for a big donation.

762
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,000
You'll play the guest
of honor and like it.

763
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,000
Aw. Well, we'll see.

764
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:15,000
( chuckling )

765
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,000
Goodbye, Mrs. Parker.

766
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,000
We'll miss you.

767
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,000
Yeah.

768
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,000
( sniffles )

769
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:59,000
DIANNE AND AMY:
Go, Hannah! Go, Hannah!

770
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:00,000
Go! Go!

771
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:03,000
Go, Hannah! Go, Hannah!
Go, Hannah!

772
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:04,000
Go! Go!

773
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,000
Go, Hannah! Go, Hannah!
Go, Hannah!

774
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,000
Go! Go!

775
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:09,000
Go, Hannah! Go, Hannah!
Go! Go!

776
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:11,000
Go, Hannah!

777
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:12,000
Whoo!

778
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:13,000
Congratulations.

779
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:14,000
Oh, thank you.

780
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:15,000
Happy new life.

781
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:16,000
Good job.

782
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,000
( laughing )

783
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:19,000
Thank you, sweetie.

784
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,000
Oh, thank you.

785
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:22,000
Mmm...

786
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:23,000
Oh, ah!

787
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:27,000
I was feeling a little sorry
for myself before, but not now.

788
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:30,000
Oh. Well, remember what
you told me at graduation?

789
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,000
"Marvels of the
universe lie ahead."

790
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:42,000
Here you go.

791
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,000
Mmm... yum.

792
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,000
Here, Julia.

793
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:49,000
She like it?

794
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:50,000
Yeah.

795
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,000
That was
her favorite.

796
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:01,000
A rabbit.

797
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,000
Oh, no.

798
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:07,000
Oh. A pig.

799
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:08,000
A pig.

800
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,000
( snorting )

801
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:22,000
Hi.

802
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:23,000
Hello.

803
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:25,000
Julia wants to go
on the Ferris wheel.

804
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:26,000
Can I take her?

805
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,000
Why don't you
and Hannah go.

806
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,000
Julia and I will stay
down here and wave

807
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,000
But Julia's the one
who wants to go.

808
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:33,000
I won't go without her;
It wouldn't be fair.

809
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:35,000
They strap them in;
it's safe.

810
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:36,000
Why don't you just take Amy.

811
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,000
Honest, Dianne,
I'm not making it up.

812
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:39,000
She said she wanted to go.

813
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:43,000
Well, it's just that it's...
it's awfully high, Amy.

814
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:44,000
She might get scared.

815
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,000
No, not if Amy's with her.

816
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,000
All right, we'll all go.

817
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:51,000
No, let her go with Amy.

818
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:53,000
Let her go with her friend.

819
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:01,000
( kids screaming )

820
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,000
How pretty.

821
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,000
( laughing )

822
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,000
Hey, guys!

823
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,000
Ahh!

824
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,000
( laughing )

825
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:41,000
Ah!

826
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:43,000
( laughs )

827
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:44,000
Oh!

828
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:45,000
Look, I did it!

829
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:49,000
Thank you.

830
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:50,000
Whoa!

831
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,000
Dianne!

832
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:05,000
What? What? What?

833
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:06,000
What's wrong?

834
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,000
Okay, I got you.
I got you.

835
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:09,000
What's happening?

836
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:10,000
Dianne, hold
down her tongue.

837
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:11,000
Get away. I know
what I'm doing.

838
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:13,000
She's bleeding!

839
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:14,000
It's her lip.

840
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,000
Mom, call an ambulance.

841
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,000
I got you, sweetie.

842
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:19,000
Julia...

843
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:20,000
I got you.

844
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:21,000
It's okay.

845
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:22,000
It's all right.

846
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:23,000
( phone rings )

847
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:24,000
( answering machine clicks )

848
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,000
Hi. This is David McCune.

849
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:29,000
I'm not here right now,
but you can leave a message.

850
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:30,000
( beep )

851
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,000
David, it's Hannah.

852
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:35,000
We have a problem with Julia.

853
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:37,000
Woman ( over PA):
Dr. Gelber. Dr. Gelber.

854
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:42,000
As soon as she's stable,
I want to transfer her to Mercy.

855
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:43,000
They don't know her here.

856
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:45,000
Hillcrest is
a good hospital.

857
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:46,000
I know. It's just...

858
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:49,000
I'm sure they're thinking,
"What's the point?"

859
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:52,000
They're taking good
care of her, Dianne.

860
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,000
The nurse asked me
if I want to speak

861
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,000
to social services
about a hospice.

862
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:59,000
I told her
Julia lives at home.

863
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:02,000
Thank God, you've
never played me

864
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,000
like a martyred mom
with a "special" kid.

865
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:08,000
David:
We'll see how she is
in the morning, okay?

866
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:09,000
Amy thinks
this was her fault.

867
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:12,000
Can you please
tell her it wasn't?

868
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:15,000
She took Julia
on the Ferris wheel.

869
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:18,000
The two of them?

870
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,000
Oh, if you'd seen her;

871
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:24,000
heard her when she got
to the top, she...

872
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,000
So excited.

873
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:29,000
My wild thing.

874
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:32,000
You're not afraid,
are you?

875
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,000
You'll try anything.

876
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:40,000
Bet you could see everything
from up there.

877
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:49,000
DAVID:
I'll talk to Goodman.

878
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:53,000
He'll probably adjust her meds.

879
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:56,000
And you just keep on going,
okay?

880
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,000
Keep on loving her.

881
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,000
Put it on there.

882
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:01,000
You got it?

883
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,000
Good job.

884
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:08,000
Like that, Julia?

885
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:09,000
Good job.

886
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:10,000
AMY:
That's cool,
Julia.

887
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:11,000
Good job.

888
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,000
What do you think?

889
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:19,000
Uh.

890
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:21,000
DIANNE:
No?

891
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:24,000
( sighs )

892
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:27,000
You need something
for the Book Lovers Ball.

893
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:29,000
Let's find you a dress.

894
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:31,000
I don't need
to go to that.

895
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:32,000
Yes, you do.

896
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:34,000
Hannah's the guest of honor.

897
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:36,000
How about this? Come on.

898
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:37,000
Let's see.

899
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:39,000
No, don't look at the tag.

900
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:40,000
It's a birthday present.

901
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:43,000
It's too much money
for a birthday present.

902
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:45,000
Besides, it's not
even my birthday.

903
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:47,000
I got my first
dress-up dress here.

904
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:48,000
( laughs )

905
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:49,000
I did, when my mother took me

906
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:52,000
to San Francisco
to see The Sound of Music.

907
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:54,000
Every summer, we'd go,
we'd leave my dad at home

908
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:57,000
and we'd go see a musical,
just the two of us.

909
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:59,000
We'd stay in a hotel,
and we'd get room service

910
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:02,000
and we'd go to the evening
performance for grownups.

911
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,000
I remember those
trips to the city.

912
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:07,000
Your little overnight bag.

913
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:10,000
Now, there is a picture
of you somewhere

914
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:14,000
in a red raincoat, standing
in front of the theater.

915
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:18,000
You should take Amy
to San Francisco

916
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,000
just for the night
to the theater.

917
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:22,000
Amy is not my daughter.

918
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:25,000
Oh, here, sweetie,
let me...

919
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:27,000
No, Mom.

920
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:29,000
One on each side.

921
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:32,000
You don't want to look
like a little schoolgirl.

922
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,000
Just give it to me.

923
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:37,000
I like the way
Dianne does it.

924
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:43,000
This way looks good, too.

925
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:45,000
Oh, wear it however you want.

926
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:46,000
I've got a headache.

927
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:48,000
Buddy's going
to take you.

928
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:50,000
( doorbell rings )

929
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:54,000
I asked Dianne to pick me up.

930
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:15,000
Hi. How are you?

931
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:16,000
Hi. Good. Thank you.

932
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:18,000
I think it could
be lots of fun.

933
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,000
There's plenty
for them to do there.

934
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:23,000
They could go
to the theater, museums.

935
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:25,000
Why, it's just
for the weekend.

936
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:27,000
Amy's never been
to San Francisco.

937
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:28,000
What about Julia?

938
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:31,000
Oh, Julia
stays with me.

939
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:36,000
HANNAH:
You know, Dianne's
never spent a night

940
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:38,000
away from that child
in six years.

941
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:40,000
It's not just Amy
I'm thinking about.

942
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:42,000
She won't do it.

943
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:43,000
Well...

944
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:45,000
I'll talk to her.

945
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:47,000
Good.

946
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:49,000
Mmm.

947
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:19,000
You lost?

948
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:22,000
Um...

949
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:24,000
What are you
doing back here?

950
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,000
Uh, just... inhaling.

951
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:27,000
( inhales )

952
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:28,000
I see.

953
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:31,000
I love the way
libraries smell.

954
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:34,000
When I was little,
my mom used to bring me here

955
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:37,000
and I thought all the books
belonged to her.

956
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:39,000
My dad built these shelves.

957
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:41,000
( sighs )

958
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:44,000
I wish he could be here tonight.

959
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:48,000
You look nice.

960
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,000
Thank you. You, too.

961
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:51,000
Thanks.

962
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:53,000
These are pretty.

963
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:56,000
Oh, they were
your grandmother's.

964
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:57,000
Mark gave them to me.

965
00:53:57,000 --> 00:54:00,000
Ah, yes. That's why
they would seem familiar.

966
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:03,000
( laughs )

967
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:04,000
Let's dance.

968
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:08,000
( giggling )

969
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:11,000
BUDDY:
I cannot believe this!

970
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:12,000
TESS:
I-I had to pay the rent...

971
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:14,000
BUDDY:
No, no, no,
it's not okay.

972
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:16,000
You told me you
were going to
give me the money

973
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:17,000
and now there's
no money.

974
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:18,000
I-I'm not saying
it's okay.

975
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:21,000
I'm just saying I don't know
where to get the money from

976
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:22,000
because it's already
gone out, that's all.

977
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:24,000
It's already
gone out.

978
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:26,000
You told me I was
going to be able
to get this amp.

979
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:27,000
I have a gig
tomorrow night!

980
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:29,000
We'll try and figure it out
as soon as I get the next...

981
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:30,000
"Try and figure..."?

982
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:31,000
What do you
want me to do?

983
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:32,000
What do you want me
to say?

984
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,000
I want you to give
me the money

985
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:36,000
that you told me you
were going to give me!

986
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,000
Okay, okay, okay!

987
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:39,000
Just shut up
and stop this!

988
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:40,000
( slapping )

989
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:41,000
( Tess screams and gasps )

990
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:43,000
I'm outta here!

991
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:45,000
( Tess sobs )

992
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:47,000
( door slams )

993
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:50,000
( sobbing continues )

994
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:52,000
( van drives away )

995
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:55,000
( dog yelping and whining )

996
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,000
Knock it off!

997
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,000
( dog quiets )

998
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:08,000
Where's your mother?

999
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:10,000
She's sleeping.

1000
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:13,000
She said she's
tired and she just
wants to sleep.

1001
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:15,000
Did you have
breakfast?

1002
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:17,000
Get out of my way.

1003
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:20,000
No.

1004
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:24,000
( dog yelping )

1005
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:26,000
Shut up!

1006
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:28,000
I said shut up!

1007
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:30,000
Buddy...

1008
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:32,000
Go get me
one of your pillowcases.

1009
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:34,000
Buddy, you can't.
You can't.

1010
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:36,000
He's just a puppy.
He can still learn.

1011
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:39,000
I swear I'll never
touch him again.

1012
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:40,000
Go get me
a pillowcase!

1013
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:42,000
No.

1014
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,000
Amy!

1015
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:20,000
( horn honking )

1016
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:26,000
( horn honks )

1017
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:28,000
( brakes squeal )

1018
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:37,000
No... no... no...

1019
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:39,000
Ow! Ow!

1020
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:40,000
( sobbing )

1021
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:44,000
Get in there!

1022
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:46,000
( sobbing )

1023
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:48,000
( whimpering )

1024
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:50,000
Now, you leave him
in there.

1025
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:52,000
( sobbing )

1026
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:25,000
Okay, get out.

1027
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:27,000
You can walk from here.

1028
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:29,000
Say "Thank you, Buddy."

1029
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:31,000
Thank you, Buddy.

1030
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:32,000
Oh, no, no,
no, no, no.

1031
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:33,000
I said you can walk.

1032
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:35,000
He's going for
a little swim.

1033
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:36,000
No!
Hey!

1034
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:38,000
Ow...

1035
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:43,000
( yelping )

1036
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:45,000
( yelping louder )

1037
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:50,000
No... no... no...!

1038
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:53,000
Buddy, Buddy, no!

1039
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:55,000
Buddy, please...

1040
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:56,000
Get off of me.

1041
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:57,000
Please don't!

1042
00:57:57,000 --> 00:58:00,000
Get out of here.

1043
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,000
Buddy...

1044
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:06,000
I told you, a dog
who won't train
isn't worth jack.

1045
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:07,000
No!

1046
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:08,000
( yelping )

1047
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:10,000
No!

1048
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:30,000
Amy Williams.
I'm her mother.

1049
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:32,000
Where is she?
I'm her mother.

1050
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:34,000
Was she admitted
in the last hour?

1051
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:35,000
Yes. They said she was here.

1052
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:37,000
Amy... Williams.

1053
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:38,000
She's fine.

1054
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:39,000
Are you sure?

1055
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:40,000
I just saw her.

1056
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:41,000
She made it to
shore with the dog.

1057
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:44,000
( relieved gasps )

1058
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:46,000
Where is she?
I want to see her.

1059
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:47,000
You got a cigarette?

1060
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:48,000
Tess, listen...
they arrested Buddy.

1061
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:50,000
What?

1062
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:52,000
Come here.
Come here.

1063
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:56,000
You have got to get
into a treatment
center... now.

1064
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:58,000
This is it, Tess.
Child Services

1065
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:00,000
has issued an order of
protection against you.

1066
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:01,000
Mommy?

1067
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:03,000
Wha...? Baby...

1068
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:05,000
Oh, honey.

1069
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:06,000
Oh... oh...

1070
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:27,000
Say good night
to Julia.

1071
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:30,000
And don't
wake her up.

1072
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:33,000
You got to keep it
nice and quiet.

1073
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:35,000
Amy...

1074
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:38,000
Do you want some hot chocolate?

1075
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:41,000
Come on.

1076
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:49,000
When I was a kid,
I used to sleep out
here in the summer.

1077
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:52,000
I'd lie on my back and
try to count the stars.

1078
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:54,000
You can't;
there's too many.

1079
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:58,000
Do you believe
in Heaven, Dianne?

1080
00:59:58,000 --> 00:59:59,000
Absolutely.

1081
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:02,000
I think my dad can see me
from Heaven.

1082
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:05,000
And I know he helped me
get to shore today.

1083
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:07,000
I know he did.

1084
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:11,000
I wish he could come back.

1085
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:12,000
So do I.

1086
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:16,000
Julia misses her dad.

1087
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:18,000
She's never met him.

1088
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:19,000
His boat could sink.

1089
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:22,000
He could drown,
just like my dad

1090
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:23,000
then it would be too late.

1091
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:25,000
Oh...

1092
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:27,000
( sniffling )

1093
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:30,000
Hey, it's clearing. Look.

1094
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:37,000
( gasps )

1095
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:39,000
Did you see that?

1096
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:40,000
Yeah. Did you make a wish?

1097
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:41,000
Yeah. Did you?

1098
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:43,000
Yeah.

1099
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:59,000
( weary sigh )

1100
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:06,000
TESS:
You want to take her
to San Francisco?

1101
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:08,000
Yeah. To see a play.

1102
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:11,000
I said she couldn't go
without your permission.

1103
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:15,000
Taking her places,
buying her clothes...

1104
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:17,000
I'm grateful to you.

1105
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:19,000
You don't need to be.

1106
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:20,000
I like Amy very much.

1107
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:22,000
She thinks you
hung the moon.

1108
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:24,000
( chuckles )

1109
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:29,000
You're going
to be okay, Tess.

1110
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:33,000
After Ryan died,
I... couldn't sleep.

1111
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:35,000
Pills didn't work.

1112
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:38,000
I drink so I can
sleep, that's all.

1113
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:43,000
I'm not very good
at being alone.

1114
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:44,000
Mom!

1115
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:50,000
Hi.

1116
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:55,000
When you're better, I
can come home, right?

1117
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:58,000
I'm your mother.
We belong together.

1118
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:01,000
AMY:
Love you.

1119
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:04,000
( horn blaring )

1120
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:06,000
Amy!

1121
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:16,000
( monitor beeping )

1122
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:25,000
Dianne?

1123
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:28,000
Dianne.

1124
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:30,000
Dianne.

1125
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:44,000
Would you like to
see your daughter?

1126
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:53,000
Not now.

1127
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:21,000
( pager beeping )

1128
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:23,000
( groaning )

1129
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:38,000
( monitor beeping )

1130
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:04,000
Dianne.

1131
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:25,000
NURSE ( on P.A. ):
Code Blue, E.R. Two.

1132
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:27,000
Code Blue, E.R. Two.

1133
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:29,000
Code Blue, E.R. Two.

1134
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:35,000
( woman screaming )

1135
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:40,000
( yelling )

1136
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:42,000
( alarm beeping )

1137
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:46,000
DOCTOR:
Losing her!
Losing her!

1138
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:16,000
( monitor beeps steadily )

1139
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:18,000
( respirator pumping )

1140
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:58,000
Done with that?

1141
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:05,000
Thanks for
the call.

1142
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:12,000
Seems like old times.

1143
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:13,000
Not really.

1144
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:15,000
I meant when Mom
was in the hospital.

1145
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:18,000
I know what
you meant.

1146
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:20,000
What are you
doing here, Mark?

1147
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:23,000
The hospital
got in touch with me.

1148
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:27,000
Well... you don't
need to stick around.

1149
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:29,000
Dianne's not your
responsibility.

1150
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:33,000
Order something else.
I'm buying.

1151
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:35,000
Just coffee.

1152
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:45,000
I thought you'd
be married by now,
have a couple of kids.

1153
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:48,000
Seeing anyone?

1154
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:51,000
20 patients a day,
on the average.

1155
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:53,000
Here's one of them.

1156
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:02,000
She's my niece.

1157
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:04,000
It's recent.

1158
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:06,000
Taken about
a month ago.

1159
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:08,000
Keep it.

1160
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:12,000
She's your daughter...

1161
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:14,000
doesn't that mean
anything to you?

1162
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:15,000
I send a check
every month.

1163
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:17,000
It's not like
I'm a deadbeat dad.

1164
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:19,000
Now what?

1165
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:21,000
You going to pay
for her funeral?

1166
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:28,000
Yeah. A few months,
at the most.

1167
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:32,000
Makes me sick,
all of it.

1168
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:34,000
Six years wasted.

1169
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:40,000
You know, Dianne takes her
to the beach sometimes.

1170
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:42,000
They sing together.

1171
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:45,000
Julia laughs when
you tickle her.

1172
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:48,000
She's got a great laugh.

1173
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:50,000
You missed out, brother.

1174
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:54,000
You can call it a waste, if that
makes you feel better about it.

1175
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:57,000
Put that back
in your wallet, huh?

1176
01:07:57,000 --> 01:08:00,000
You tell everyone
that Dianne's your wife,
or is it a private game?

1177
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:06,000
Whoa! Hey!
Knock it off!

1178
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:13,000
Sorry.

1179
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:32,000
Dr. McCune?

1180
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:33,000
What is it?

1181
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:35,000
Dianne Parker's awake.

1182
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:36,000
She's asking for you.

1183
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:37,000
Great.

1184
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:51,000
Where's David?

1185
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:53,000
What?

1186
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:56,000
Where is David?

1187
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:59,000
He's not here yet.

1188
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:00,000
Amy?

1189
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:02,000
She's okay.

1190
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:04,000
I'm not lying to you.

1191
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:06,000
You want me to
get the nurse?

1192
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:08,000
You're here.

1193
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:12,000
Yeah. You had my business card
in your bag.

1194
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:16,000
I'm sorry.

1195
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:17,000
You can go.

1196
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:19,000
What? You kidding?

1197
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:22,000
You hate hospitals.

1198
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:26,000
I'm not going
to lose you again.

1199
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:30,000
Am I dying?

1200
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:31,000
No.

1201
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:34,000
Not on my watch.

1202
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:58,000
TESS:
My little girl was hit by a car.

1203
01:09:58,000 --> 01:09:59,000
She's okay.

1204
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:02,000
A drunk driver.

1205
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:09,000
You say trust in
your higher power.

1206
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:10,000
Why should I
trust something

1207
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:13,000
that sends a storm
to drown Ryan

1208
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:15,000
or a car to hit
my little girl?

1209
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:18,000
If God wants to
teach me a lesson

1210
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:21,000
why doesn't he send a
drunk driver to hit me?

1211
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:23,000
I mean, that's fair

1212
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:26,000
but Amy's just
a little girl.

1213
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:29,000
She's never, ever
done anything bad.

1214
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:37,000
If there is some master plan,
I don't see it.

1215
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:40,000
I'd like to, 'cause
whatever it is

1216
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:44,000
it's got to be better
than what I've been doing.

1217
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:49,000
AMY:
I'm not going back.

1218
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:50,000
Not until you do.

1219
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:52,000
You can tell Julia
I'm all right.

1220
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:55,000
I don't want her to be scared.

1221
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:56,000
Hannah's there.

1222
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:59,000
You understand her
better than anybody.

1223
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:01,000
She trusts you.

1224
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:03,000
I can't leave
until you're okay.

1225
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:05,000
( sobbing )

1226
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:08,000
Amy.

1227
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:09,000
It's my fault.

1228
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:12,000
We came here
because of me.

1229
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:14,000
Everybody gets hurt
because of me.

1230
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:16,000
I don't take good
care of Julia.

1231
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:18,000
Look what happened
at the carnival.

1232
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:21,000
I didn't take good care
of my mom, either.

1233
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:22,000
I hurt people.

1234
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:24,000
I hurt everybody.

1235
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:26,000
Oh, Amy, no.

1236
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:27,000
It's okay.

1237
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:29,000
Listen...

1238
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:32,000
sometimes I feel
just the way you said.

1239
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:34,000
'Cause I can't
fix something,
it's my fault.

1240
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:36,000
I'm a doctor... I'm supposed
to make everything okay.

1241
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:38,000
But I can't.

1242
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:40,000
We can't, Amy.

1243
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:45,000
We can't stop...

1244
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:48,000
taxis from jumping the curb
or boats from sinking.

1245
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:50,000
We just do
what we can

1246
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:52,000
and try not
to blame ourselves

1247
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:53,000
or anybody else,
that's it.

1248
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:56,000
I made Julia have a
seizure at the carnival.

1249
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:57,000
Julia's had seizures before

1250
01:11:57,000 --> 01:11:59,000
It isn't anything you did.

1251
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:01,000
This has been the best summer

1252
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:04,000
of her life, Amy.

1253
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:05,000
Come here.

1254
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:11,000
Do you know what
it's meant to me

1255
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:13,000
for Julia to have a friend?

1256
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:17,000
I don't think
I can tell you.

1257
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:21,000
Not in words.

1258
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:25,000
Your mother wants
to get better because of you.

1259
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:29,000
Don't you see, it's just
the opposite of what you think.

1260
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:31,000
You're so good...

1261
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:34,000
for everyone.

1262
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:37,000
Can you do something for me?

1263
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:40,000
It's important.

1264
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:42,000
Go back.

1265
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:44,000
Tell Julia I love her

1266
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:47,000
and I'm coming home.

1267
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:49,000
Okay?

1268
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:52,000
Thank you.

1269
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:19,000
I went to three
different places.

1270
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:22,000
No one had lilacs.

1271
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:35,000
I guess this isn't
a good time to talk.

1272
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:37,000
There's nothing
to talk about.

1273
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:42,000
You still had my
card in your handbag.

1274
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:44,000
I gave that to you
when we went dancing

1275
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:46,000
on the pier
six years ago.

1276
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:50,000
It's an evening bag.

1277
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:51,000
I never use it.

1278
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:54,000
Don't turn this into something.

1279
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:57,000
You know, I was docking
when the hospital called.

1280
01:13:57,000 --> 01:14:00,000
Docking here in San Francisco,
a cab ride away.

1281
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:02,000
What are the odds on that?

1282
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:03,000
I'm tired.

1283
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:06,000
We're meant to
be together.

1284
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:09,000
We're getting
a second chance.

1285
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:14,000
Dianne...

1286
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:20,000
I'm not going
to leave this time.

1287
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:29,000
All right?

1288
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:30,000
I appreciate it.

1289
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:31,000
Thanks.

1290
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:33,000
Okay. I've arranged
for an ambulance

1291
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:36,000
to take Dianne to the
hospital in Hawthorne

1292
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:37,000
as soon as she's
ready to be moved.

1293
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:39,000
She can have the
knee surgery there

1294
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:40,000
maybe by Friday.

1295
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:41,000
I'll stay here with her.

1296
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:42,000
You can go back.

1297
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:44,000
Uh...

1298
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:47,000
Look, I never stopped
thinking about her

1299
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:48,000
not one day.

1300
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:51,000
Things could
have been different.

1301
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:52,000
Now they are.

1302
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:53,000
Dianne wants you to stay?

1303
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:55,000
Ask her.

1304
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:18,000
TESS:
I've had enough therapy.

1305
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:20,000
I want to go home.

1306
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:21,000
Amy's coming back.

1307
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:23,000
She's got her arm
in a cast.

1308
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:26,000
She's going to need help
getting dressed.

1309
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:27,000
You're not ready.

1310
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:29,000
You need more time, Tess.

1311
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:31,000
I want it to be me.

1312
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:34,000
I want to be the one
to help her, not somebody else.

1313
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:35,000
The important thing now

1314
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:38,000
is to help yourself
and to get better.

1315
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:40,000
Helping Amy would
help me get better.

1316
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:44,000
I want to think
about somebody else.

1317
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:46,000
When I think
about myself

1318
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:48,000
I don't want
to get better.

1319
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:52,000
I don't get how people
can forgive themselves.

1320
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:54,000
I don't understand how
to say life is not so bad

1321
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:55,000
when it is.

1322
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:57,000
You're going to feel
pain sometimes, Tess

1323
01:15:57,000 --> 01:15:59,000
but you can handle that.

1324
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:00,000
No one's happy all the time.

1325
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:03,000
It's what you do with it.

1326
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:08,000
I want to go home.

1327
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:12,000
I'll feel better
once I know you're there.

1328
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:13,000
I'll leave tonight,
if you want.

1329
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:16,000
Mark says he'll
stay around

1330
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:18,000
until they
transfer you.

1331
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:20,000
Unless you don't
want him here.

1332
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:23,000
I can have Greenwald
restrict your visitors.

1333
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:25,000
No.

1334
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:28,000
I need to forgive him.

1335
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:31,000
For my sake as much
as for Julia's.

1336
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:34,000
You still love him?

1337
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:37,000
I'm sorry.

1338
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:40,000
None of my business.

1339
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:46,000
I need time.

1340
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:49,000
That's all I can think about
right now is time.

1341
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:53,000
Julia has so little left.

1342
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:57,000
He doesn't know that.

1343
01:16:57,000 --> 01:16:58,000
I haven't told him.

1344
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:01,000
I don't know, David.

1345
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:03,000
It's hard to think right now.

1346
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:07,000
He never took off
his wedding band.

1347
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:20,000
Here, baby, just...
just take it.

1348
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:22,000
I'll see you at
Hawthorne, okay?

1349
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:23,000
Bye.

1350
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:24,000
Bye.

1351
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:07,000
There she is!
Julia!

1352
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:11,000
Hi! Hi, sweetie.

1353
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:12,000
Oh...

1354
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:16,000
How's my girl?

1355
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:17,000
How's my girl?

1356
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:18,000
You look good.

1357
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:20,000
I missed you so much.

1358
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:22,000
How's Amy?

1359
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:23,000
She's doing fine.

1360
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:25,000
David's watching her.

1361
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:27,000
Here, give me that.

1362
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:37,000
Do I tell you I'd
be lost without you

1363
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:38,000
or do you know it?

1364
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:40,000
I think you'd manage.

1365
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:44,000
Dianne, I have a lot
of respect for you...

1366
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:45,000
as a person,
as a woman.

1367
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:48,000
And not just because
you're my daughter.

1368
01:19:55,000 --> 01:19:56,000
Mom...

1369
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:00,000
Mark was in
San Francisco.

1370
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:03,000
I know.
David told me.

1371
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:06,000
He wants to come back.

1372
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:10,000
He wants to get
married again.

1373
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:11,000
Well, whatever
you decide

1374
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:13,000
you'll be doing
the right thing.

1375
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:15,000
I want to know
what you think.

1376
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:18,000
That you deserve
to be happy

1377
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:21,000
and no one can
define that for you.

1378
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:24,000
I never really forgave him.

1379
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:26,000
I can now.

1380
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:28,000
He's changed now.

1381
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:31,000
He's... he's older.

1382
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:33,000
I'm older, too.

1383
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:36,000
I'm not expecting it to be

1384
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:38,000
exactly the way it
was, you know.

1385
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:40,000
I mean, a lot's happened
in six years.

1386
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:43,000
To you it has.

1387
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:47,000
I wish I were certain.

1388
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:51,000
I was so certain
when we got married.

1389
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:53,000
Mark's sure.

1390
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:55,000
He says we're meant
to be together.

1391
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:57,000
Mmm.

1392
01:20:57,000 --> 01:20:58,000
Is that his wedding ring?

1393
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:01,000
He never stopped wearing it.

1394
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:02,000
He made me take it.

1395
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:06,000
No one's ever made you
do anything.

1396
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:20,000
It's not too late for Julia
to know her father...

1397
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:22,000
that's what I keep thinking.

1398
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:45,000
( knocking )

1399
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:47,000
Who do you have to know

1400
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:48,000
to get a shave
around here?

1401
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:50,000
Come on in.

1402
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:00,000
Hey.
Hi.

1403
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:02,000
I'll leave the key for you
on the kitchen table.

1404
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:03,000
Thanks.

1405
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:04,000
It's your house, too.

1406
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:07,000
Yeah, I don't see
bunking at her mother's.

1407
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:11,000
Put a good word in for me
with Hannah, I'd appreciate it.

1408
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:13,000
How's Dianne?

1409
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:15,000
Been to see her?

1410
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:17,000
She's got enough visitors
without me hanging around.

1411
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:19,000
If you hurry up, I'll
take you to the hospital.

1412
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:21,000
Uh, I'll get a cab.

1413
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:23,000
Wish me luck.

1414
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:25,000
Good luck.

1415
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:27,000
Hey, you know,
I've been thinking

1416
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:29,000
Dianne and I should
move up to Portland.

1417
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:31,000
Get a really fresh start.

1418
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:33,000
I got enough money
to put down on a place...

1419
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:35,000
nothing grand.

1420
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:36,000
You know Seaside?

1421
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:38,000
Just north of Rockaway Beach.

1422
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:40,000
I brought some pictures.

1423
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:52,000
Oh, it looks like
you got company.

1424
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:53,000
Hey.

1425
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:54,000
You want to stay in
the chair for a while?

1426
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:55,000
Yeah, thanks.

1427
01:22:55,000 --> 01:22:57,000
All right, no dancing.

1428
01:22:57,000 --> 01:22:59,000
You weren't here.
I thought I got stood up.

1429
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:01,000
I was in X ray.
I'm sorry.

1430
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:03,000
Someone should
have told you.

1431
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:04,000
Nah, I didn't ask.

1432
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:05,000
Hey, look,
let's get out of here.

1433
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:07,000
I can't propose
sitting next to a bedpan.

1434
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:09,000
Mark, uh...

1435
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:11,000
Yes, I can.

1436
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:13,000
( sighs )

1437
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:14,000
Marry me.

1438
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:15,000
Please.

1439
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:16,000
Are you sure?

1440
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:18,000
Yes. I love you.

1441
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:20,000
I never stopped missing you.

1442
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:23,000
You know, I hate that we lost
these six years

1443
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:24,000
and I want to make
them up somehow.

1444
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:26,000
I don't think they were lost...
I lived them.

1445
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:29,000
You're right, you're right.

1446
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:33,000
It's not starting over,
it's starting now.

1447
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:35,000
Everything's a first, okay?

1448
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:38,000
'Kay.

1449
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:40,000
I knew right
when I saw it.

1450
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:43,000
Isn't that a great
old farm house?

1451
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:44,000
Yeah.

1452
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:46,000
Just an hour
north of Portland.

1453
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:49,000
It's great, but we can't
take Julie to a farmhouse

1454
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:50,000
in the middle of nowhere.

1455
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:52,000
All her doctors are here.

1456
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:54,000
I meant in
the spring.

1457
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:58,000
It'll be good for
you... afterwards.

1458
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:00,000
After she dies?

1459
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:03,000
Is that what you mean?

1460
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:05,000
Move after she dies?

1461
01:24:05,000 --> 01:24:07,000
That's the plan?

1462
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:10,000
Look... David told me

1463
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:14,000
that she's only got
a few months left.

1464
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:16,000
Dianne...

1465
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:19,000
If David told you
she had ten years left

1466
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:21,000
would you be here
right now?

1467
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:22,000
Be honest with me.

1468
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:23,000
No, you be honest.

1469
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:24,000
Would you do it again

1470
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:26,000
knowing the kind of
life she's had...

1471
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:27,000
with doctors and surgery?

1472
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:29,000
You don't know anything
about her life.

1473
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:30,000
She has a friend.

1474
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:32,000
They tell secrets

1475
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:35,000
and share ice cream
and sing songs.

1476
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:36,000
She's dying.

1477
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:38,000
She's not even
six years old

1478
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:39,000
and she's dying.

1479
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:41,000
Now, what was the point?

1480
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:47,000
Look, we're going to
have kids... healthy kids.

1481
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:49,000
We're going to have
a real family.

1482
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:51,000
Do you even know
what that is?

1483
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:54,000
Or do you mean
a "perfect" family

1484
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:56,000
where no one's ever sick

1485
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:59,000
or angry or sad
or in pain?

1486
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:01,000
Six years, Mark...

1487
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:05,000
you've never even
touched your daughter...

1488
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:07,000
never even seen her.

1489
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:08,000
Oh, what are we
talking about?

1490
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:11,000
I love you, and that's
all that matters now.

1491
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:14,000
Where were you?

1492
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:17,000
What were you doing, Mark,
when I was up all night crying

1493
01:25:17,000 --> 01:25:19,000
because I was too tired
to fall asleep?

1494
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:22,000
Where were you when
I was changing diapers

1495
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:23,000
or going to the grocery store

1496
01:25:23,000 --> 01:25:25,000
or taking walks
on the beach?

1497
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:26,000
Where were you?!

1498
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:28,000
I'm... I'm here now.

1499
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:30,000
Six years...

1500
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:34,000
for six years I have been
apologizing for you in my head

1501
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:36,000
trying to understand

1502
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:37,000
trying to make excuses

1503
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:39,000
and... now I understand.

1504
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:40,000
Understand what?

1505
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:44,000
Julia is my daughter.

1506
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:46,000
She is...

1507
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:49,000
part of who I am

1508
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:52,000
and who I have become.

1509
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:54,000
I don't know you.

1510
01:25:55,000 --> 01:25:58,000
And you sure don't know me.

1511
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:02,000
I want you
to leave us alone.

1512
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:08,000
Don't come back.

1513
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:35,000
Hi.

1514
01:26:35,000 --> 01:26:36,000
Hey.

1515
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:40,000
Hannah, can I ask
you a question?

1516
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:42,000
Sure.

1517
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:43,000
It's about Julia's dad.
Oh.

1518
01:26:43,000 --> 01:26:45,000
I thought he was coming
to see her.

1519
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:46,000
Things didn't work out.

1520
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:47,000
Why not?

1521
01:26:47,000 --> 01:26:50,000
Well, I don't have an answer
to that question...

1522
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:52,000
not a simple one,
that's for sure.

1523
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:55,000
But we don't always choose
the right people to love.

1524
01:26:55,000 --> 01:26:56,000
Poets deceive us...

1525
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:58,000
talk about the feeling

1526
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:01,000
and things
we say to each other...

1527
01:27:01,000 --> 01:27:03,000
and those things
are important...

1528
01:27:03,000 --> 01:27:06,000
but in the end,
it all comes down

1529
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:10,000
to how much we're willing
to give of ourselves.

1530
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:13,000
Like Romeo and Juliet
dying for each other.

1531
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:15,000
Well, I don't know
if killing yourself

1532
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:17,000
in a crypt before you check
your girlfriend for a pulse

1533
01:27:17,000 --> 01:27:19,000
is an act of love

1534
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:20,000
but it makes
for a good story.

1535
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:23,000
Love isn't always
so dramatic...

1536
01:27:23,000 --> 01:27:26,000
but it is an adventure.

1537
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:28,000
( kissing sounds )

1538
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:30,000
( chuckling )

1539
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:36,000
I just spoke
to Tess Williams.

1540
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:37,000
She's coming home tomorrow.

1541
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:39,000
Oh, good.

1542
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:40,000
Where's Amy?

1543
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:41,000
Oh, she rode her
bike into town.

1544
01:27:41,000 --> 01:27:43,000
Oh.

1545
01:27:43,000 --> 01:27:45,000
You think Tess knows
the Dewey decimal system?

1546
01:27:45,000 --> 01:27:46,000
I bet she could learn.

1547
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:47,000
Mmm.

1548
01:27:47,000 --> 01:27:49,000
Why, are you going
to get her a job?

1549
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:50,000
Well, I can try.

1550
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:52,000
David and I
were talking about it.

1551
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:53,000
He thinks
he may know a doctor

1552
01:27:53,000 --> 01:27:54,000
who needs a receptionist.

1553
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:55,000
How is David?

1554
01:27:55,000 --> 01:27:58,000
Well, I invited him to dinner

1555
01:27:58,000 --> 01:28:00,000
but he took a rain check.

1556
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:03,000
You know
he's selling his house?

1557
01:28:03,000 --> 01:28:05,000
Where's he going to live?

1558
01:28:05,000 --> 01:28:07,000
I saw his sign
on my way back from the market.

1559
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:09,000
Hmm.

1560
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:11,000
Well, maybe he's getting
a bigger place.

1561
01:28:11,000 --> 01:28:12,000
Is he seeing anybody?

1562
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:14,000
Don't ask me.

1563
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:15,000
Ask him.

1564
01:28:15,000 --> 01:28:19,000
Oh, stop avoiding him,
Di, it's silly.

1565
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:20,000
He cares about you.

1566
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:21,000
He always has.

1567
01:28:21,000 --> 01:28:23,000
I know, and I didn't
treat him very well.

1568
01:28:23,000 --> 01:28:24,000
I carried a torch for Mark

1569
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:26,000
and David got tired
of being patient.

1570
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:28,000
Why do you think
he's not coming to dinner?

1571
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:30,000
Well, maybe because
I invited him, not you.

1572
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:33,000
Or maybe it's because
he's seeing somebody.

1573
01:28:33,000 --> 01:28:34,000
No...

1574
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:36,000
it's just better
that I stay away from him.

1575
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:38,000
All I ever gave David
was a hard time.

1576
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:41,000
Tomorrow's another day,
Scarlett.

1577
01:28:41,000 --> 01:28:43,000
She blew her chance.

1578
01:28:58,000 --> 01:29:00,000
Amy!

1579
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:02,000
She's here.

1580
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:06,000
Mom!

1581
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:07,000
Oh, Amy!

1582
01:29:07,000 --> 01:29:09,000
I missed you so much.

1583
01:29:09,000 --> 01:29:11,000
Oh!

1584
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:13,000
Let me look at you.

1585
01:29:13,000 --> 01:29:15,000
You look great.

1586
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:18,000
A lot better than
I used to, right?

1587
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:20,000
I feel better, too.

1588
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:22,000
I'm not perfect,
you know.

1589
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:24,000
You don't go in
and come out

1590
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:26,000
and that's it.

1591
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:28,000
I've got
to go to meetings

1592
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:31,000
and... and get
lots of exercise

1593
01:29:31,000 --> 01:29:33,000
and I've got
to eat right.

1594
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:35,000
Can't sit around
and get sad.

1595
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:37,000
I got to get a job.

1596
01:29:41,000 --> 01:29:45,000
Oh, Amy, I almost lost you.

1597
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:48,000
I'm so sorry.

1598
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:49,000
Would you forgive me?

1599
01:29:49,000 --> 01:29:52,000
Mom, I can
exercise with you.

1600
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:53,000
We'll go on walks

1601
01:29:53,000 --> 01:29:55,000
and I'll jog
if you want.

1602
01:29:55,000 --> 01:29:57,000
That would be great.

1603
01:29:57,000 --> 01:29:58,000
I would love that.

1604
01:29:58,000 --> 01:30:00,000
You and me,
we're going to make it

1605
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:02,000
right?

1606
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:03,000
Right.

1607
01:30:07,000 --> 01:30:10,000
And we can talk about Dad.

1608
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:13,000
I'm a lot braver now.

1609
01:30:17,000 --> 01:30:19,000
I'm going home
with my mom now

1610
01:30:19,000 --> 01:30:21,000
but I'll be back
to play, okay?

1611
01:30:21,000 --> 01:30:23,000
Not in the morning,
because school's starting.

1612
01:30:23,000 --> 01:30:26,000
But after school,
sometimes

1613
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:29,000
if I don't have
too much homework.

1614
01:30:29,000 --> 01:30:32,000
And every Sunday
with my mom for pancakes.

1615
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:34,000
Mee...

1616
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:38,000
Bye.

1617
01:30:41,000 --> 01:30:43,000
Well, it's just you
and me now, kiddo.

1618
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:48,000
But you know what?

1619
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:53,000
We're still going to have fun,
just like we always have.

1620
01:30:53,000 --> 01:30:57,000
We'll swim
and we'll take our walks

1621
01:30:57,000 --> 01:31:02,000
and we'll sing
and we'll read stories...

1622
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:06,000
Maybe we'll pick out some new
wallpaper for your room, hmm?

1623
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:09,000
I wouldn't trade one minute
we've had together.

1624
01:31:09,000 --> 01:31:12,000
Not for all the tea in China.

1625
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:16,000
Do you know how much tea
there is in China?

1626
01:31:19,000 --> 01:31:20,000
Oh.

1627
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:24,000
You make my days,
you know that?

1628
01:31:27,000 --> 01:31:29,000
Yeah, she knows.

1629
01:31:29,000 --> 01:31:32,000
She wants you to know
she says thank you for her life.

1630
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:35,000
She's glad
you're her mom.

1631
01:31:35,000 --> 01:31:37,000
She's glad she's here.

1632
01:31:37,000 --> 01:31:42,000
She wouldn't
trade you, either.

1633
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:45,000
She loves you, Dianne.

1634
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:49,000
Oh, Amy...

1635
01:31:49,000 --> 01:31:50,000
thank you.

1636
01:32:01,000 --> 01:32:03,000
Thank you.

1637
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:28,000
Thought I'd
find you here.

1638
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:29,000
Hi.

1639
01:32:29,000 --> 01:32:31,000
How are you?

1640
01:32:31,000 --> 01:32:32,000
I haven't
seen you lately.

1641
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:34,000
Hannah's been
bringing Julia by.

1642
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:37,000
Oh, yeah. I didn't want
to drive 'cause my knee...

1643
01:32:37,000 --> 01:32:39,000
Ah, yes. I talked
to Dr. Lawry,

1644
01:32:39,000 --> 01:32:41,000
He's pretty happy
with your progress.

1645
01:32:41,000 --> 01:32:44,000
Well, as long
as he's happy...

1646
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:45,000
Do you have a minute?

1647
01:32:45,000 --> 01:32:46,000
Or an hour, really?

1648
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:48,000
I made an offer on a house.

1649
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:50,000
I need someone's
excellent opinion.

1650
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:51,000
Sure.

1651
01:32:51,000 --> 01:32:53,000
Do you mind?

1652
01:32:53,000 --> 01:32:55,000
Yeah, no. No.

1653
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:28,000
Wow.

1654
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:29,000
It's great.

1655
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:38,000
Nice door... oh...

1656
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:40,000
Well, that's easy to fix.

1657
01:33:41,000 --> 01:33:43,000
There's good light.

1658
01:33:45,000 --> 01:33:49,000
You could do floor-to-ceiling
bookshelves right here.

1659
01:33:49,000 --> 01:33:50,000
Yes.

1660
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:52,000
I could...
I could do that.

1661
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:58,000
You could
take these doors off.

1662
01:33:58,000 --> 01:34:00,000
You know,
have open shelves?

1663
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:02,000
Or I can make you new ones.

1664
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:04,000
I like the ones
in Hannah's kitchen.

1665
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:05,000
My dad did those.

1666
01:34:05,000 --> 01:34:07,000
This is what sold me...
this room here.

1667
01:34:07,000 --> 01:34:08,000
It could be a bedroom.

1668
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:10,000
It's two steps
from the kitchen.

1669
01:34:10,000 --> 01:34:13,000
It's got an outside door
right there.

1670
01:34:13,000 --> 01:34:15,000
It's connected
to the bathroom.

1671
01:34:15,000 --> 01:34:16,000
It would
save your back.

1672
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:17,000
My back?

1673
01:34:17,000 --> 01:34:20,000
Yeah, if this
were Julia's room.

1674
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:22,000
You wouldn't have to carry her
up and down the stairs.

1675
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:23,000
I've seen you
at your mother's house.

1676
01:34:23,000 --> 01:34:26,000
You probably go up and down,
like, a dozen times a day.

1677
01:34:29,000 --> 01:34:32,000
Not a very romantic proposal,
is it?

1678
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:34,000
Marry me
and eliminate lower back pain.

1679
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:37,000
It's not how
I was going to say it.

1680
01:34:39,000 --> 01:34:40,000
I'm sorry.

1681
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:42,000
I didn't mean to, uh...

1682
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:46,000
I thought it was too late.

1683
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:49,000
I thought I missed my chance.

1684
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:54,000
I love you.

1685
01:34:54,000 --> 01:34:55,000
I want to marry you

1686
01:34:55,000 --> 01:34:56,000
I want
to adopt Julia

1687
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:59,000
and I want to live
in this house together.

1688
01:34:59,000 --> 01:35:00,000
As a family.

1689
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:04,000
That's what I... I want.

1690
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:08,000
That and bookshelves.

1691
01:35:10,000 --> 01:35:11,000
What about you?

1692
01:35:11,000 --> 01:35:13,000
That's what
I've always wanted.

1693
01:35:19,000 --> 01:35:23,000
Why has it taken me
so long to see it?

1694
01:35:43,000 --> 01:35:45,000
Hey, guys!

1695
01:35:45,000 --> 01:35:47,000
Hi.

1696
01:35:47,000 --> 01:35:48,000
Welcome.
Thanks.

1697
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:55,000
Hi, Julia.
Hi, Hannah.

1698
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:58,000
Hey, Martha.

1699
01:35:59,000 --> 01:36:01,000
Hi.

1700
01:36:01,000 --> 01:36:03,000
Glad you got here.

1701
01:36:03,000 --> 01:36:05,000
Yeah, you've been
waiting for her.

1702
01:36:05,000 --> 01:36:07,000
Listen, can you stay
with her for a second?

1703
01:36:07,000 --> 01:36:09,000
I want to help Dianne,
if I can find here.

1704
01:36:09,000 --> 01:36:11,000
Oh, there you are.

1705
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:24,000
I think everyone's here.

1706
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:26,000
Hey, look.

1707
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:28,000
There she is.

1708
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:30,000
Hello.

1709
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:31,000
Good to see you.

1710
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:36,000
MAN:
Over here. Picture.

1711
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:38,000
Everybody's looking
this way now.

1712
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:40,000
And... smile.
