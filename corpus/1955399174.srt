1
00:03:02,815 --> 00:03:06,118
God, I am so sorry.
I had no idea
what that was going to be.

2
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:07,920
No, no, really,
it is okay.

3
00:03:07,922 --> 00:03:10,856
Oh! How can people stand
to watch that kind of crap?

4
00:03:12,859 --> 00:03:17,763
Probably permanently damaged
your opinion of us
as a race, as a town.

5
00:03:19,632 --> 00:03:21,867
No, really,
it is all new to me.

6
00:03:21,869 --> 00:03:23,635
I'm happy to see it.

7
00:03:32,078 --> 00:03:33,845
- Wonderful performance.
- Thank you.

8
00:03:33,847 --> 00:03:36,014
Really great.

9
00:03:36,016 --> 00:03:38,116
Come on.
We got to be to work
in an hour.

10
00:03:48,294 --> 00:03:51,763
Ugh!
I have totally failed
in my duty as a host.

11
00:03:51,765 --> 00:03:54,099
I'll make it up to you,
though, I promise.

12
00:03:54,101 --> 00:03:56,768
We'll give you a real
California welcome yet.

13
00:03:56,770 --> 00:03:58,070
Listen to this.

14
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:04,843
"The actor is in
a wretched state,

15
00:04:04,845 --> 00:04:08,513
"exploited like
a prostitute.

16
00:04:08,515 --> 00:04:10,549
"But just..."

17
00:04:12,518 --> 00:04:14,620
You really liked it?

18
00:04:14,622 --> 00:04:18,590
Yeah. I thought
it was very free.

19
00:04:18,592 --> 00:04:21,226
It was that.

20
00:04:21,228 --> 00:04:24,196
Sit, sit, please.

21
00:04:24,198 --> 00:04:27,633
This is your home now too.
I want you to feel that way,
okay?

22
00:04:27,635 --> 00:04:29,234
Thank you.
That's very kind.

23
00:04:29,236 --> 00:04:31,069
Can I pick you anything up
on my way home?

24
00:04:31,071 --> 00:04:34,406
Except cigarettes.
I won't participate
in a suicide.

25
00:04:34,408 --> 00:04:35,941
Hmm.

26
00:04:35,943 --> 00:04:38,477
Um, no, thank you.
It's fine.

27
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:40,345
What time do you have
to be there tomorrow?

28
00:04:40,347 --> 00:04:41,913
9:00.

29
00:04:42,382 --> 00:04:43,649
You nervous?

30
00:04:44,684 --> 00:04:48,353
Uh, I'm prepared.

31
00:04:51,524 --> 00:04:55,661
I know I keep saying this,
but I'm glad you're here.

32
00:04:59,499 --> 00:05:00,832
Thank you.

33
00:05:58,858 --> 00:06:00,425
Hey!

34
00:06:02,762 --> 00:06:03,929
Hey!

35
00:06:05,064 --> 00:06:07,032
Hey! Hey!

36
00:06:16,409 --> 00:06:17,609
Aah!

37
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:25,951
I kick your ass, dude!

38
00:06:43,837 --> 00:06:47,239
Osman. Holy shit.
Joseph. Joseph kidd.

39
00:06:47,241 --> 00:06:49,040
Oh, good to be
finally meeting you.

40
00:06:49,042 --> 00:06:50,342
I'm honored, truly.

41
00:06:50,344 --> 00:06:52,878
Sierra, this man is a hero.

42
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:54,980
Really?
What did you do?

43
00:06:54,982 --> 00:06:57,616
Nothing, I don't know...
I can't believe you're here!

44
00:06:57,618 --> 00:06:59,084
I just have to ask.

45
00:06:59,786 --> 00:07:01,753
Are you okay?

46
00:07:01,755 --> 00:07:04,556
Yes, I'm fine.
"Fine." Christ.

47
00:07:04,558 --> 00:07:08,059
What a world, right?
You ever see
such a sleepy newsroom?

48
00:07:08,061 --> 00:07:10,762
Look alive, people.

49
00:07:10,764 --> 00:07:15,300
This man spent half his life
reporting from a war zone.

50
00:07:15,302 --> 00:07:18,837
Dodging bullets while you
were slapping at flies.

51
00:07:20,541 --> 00:07:23,508
Seriously, you're all over
Gabe's piece for the<i> time.</i>

52
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:25,777
Great work.
Heart-stopping shit.

53
00:07:25,779 --> 00:07:29,881
Well, I... I was mostly
just arranging travel for him

54
00:07:29,883 --> 00:07:32,584
and interpreting
for him on that.

55
00:07:32,586 --> 00:07:34,152
So...

56
00:07:34,154 --> 00:07:37,222
Well, pull that chair up
and close that door,
will you?

57
00:07:40,426 --> 00:07:42,427
Okay.

58
00:07:42,429 --> 00:07:44,296
What can I do for you?

59
00:07:44,298 --> 00:07:46,765
First, I want
to thank you again.

60
00:07:46,767 --> 00:07:49,267
To you, to Gabe,
i say thanks.

61
00:07:49,269 --> 00:07:50,902
Of course, of course.

62
00:07:52,071 --> 00:07:54,473
I'm still coming up
with ideas,

63
00:07:54,475 --> 00:08:00,078
but I thought maybe
i could start
with early impressions.

64
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:04,883
Maybe the first day in town,
or something short
about the play.

65
00:08:04,885 --> 00:08:06,718
The play?
Of course, that's not all.

66
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:09,955
It's just to begin.
Part of a whole series.

67
00:08:09,957 --> 00:08:12,724
But everything is so new.
It's so very bright
in my mind.

68
00:08:12,726 --> 00:08:13,792
Very strong.

69
00:08:13,794 --> 00:08:15,327
Okay.
Yes.

70
00:08:15,329 --> 00:08:16,695
Did you... did you go?

71
00:08:16,697 --> 00:08:18,597
Uh...
Gloria took me,

72
00:08:18,599 --> 00:08:20,165
and she didn't know
what it was.

73
00:08:20,167 --> 00:08:22,200
But it was ecstatic.

74
00:08:22,202 --> 00:08:24,469
The actors were working
very hard,

75
00:08:24,471 --> 00:08:27,138
doing tasks
i didn't understand,
but still work,

76
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:31,576
hard work of some kind,
and they were
speaking Polish.

77
00:08:31,578 --> 00:08:34,980
I don't know why,
but there was a man
and a machine,

78
00:08:34,982 --> 00:08:37,249
and the man was nude
with a hat.

79
00:08:37,251 --> 00:08:38,783
And it was...

80
00:08:39,485 --> 00:08:40,919
Very American.

81
00:08:40,921 --> 00:08:43,989
That sounds insane.
Yes.

82
00:08:43,991 --> 00:08:46,791
But I think it could be
a good first assignment.

83
00:08:46,793 --> 00:08:50,228
A first... wait.
Yeah.
Again, that's just one idea.

84
00:08:50,230 --> 00:08:53,265
I know I sound very vague,
but I have to tell you,

85
00:08:53,267 --> 00:08:55,300
I'm very nervous...

86
00:08:56,636 --> 00:09:00,171
Because I'm just
very grateful to you...

87
00:09:00,173 --> 00:09:01,773
Oh, shit.

88
00:09:01,775 --> 00:09:06,378
Did Gabe tell you
i could give you a job?

89
00:09:07,413 --> 00:09:08,713
Yes.

90
00:09:09,649 --> 00:09:11,650
Oh, Jesus.

91
00:09:12,718 --> 00:09:15,287
This is embarrassing.

92
00:09:15,289 --> 00:09:16,788
Well, I don't have to write
about the play.

93
00:09:16,790 --> 00:09:19,824
No, no, no, I...
I think you misunderstand.

94
00:09:19,826 --> 00:09:21,359
There's no money.

95
00:09:21,361 --> 00:09:24,296
But I thought...
I'm sorry, man.

96
00:09:24,298 --> 00:09:28,133
There's really nothing.

97
00:09:38,210 --> 00:09:39,544
Okay.

98
00:09:40,479 --> 00:09:42,180
Thank you for your time.

99
00:09:44,317 --> 00:09:47,018
Oh, wait. The blotter.

100
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:50,255
I can give you 50 bucks a week
to write a police blotter.

101
00:09:51,257 --> 00:09:53,058
What's a police blotter?

102
00:10:02,168 --> 00:10:03,568

I can't sit around copying
reports for $50 a week.
I need to do something.

118
00:11:01,527 --> 00:11:02,861
What?

119
00:11:04,397 --> 00:11:08,600
I know it sounds silly,
but before,

120
00:11:08,602 --> 00:11:11,202
when I'm thinking
of the California,

121
00:11:12,138 --> 00:11:14,205
it looked different
in my mind.

122
00:11:14,207 --> 00:11:16,307
What, like big tits
and sand?

123
00:11:25,919 --> 00:11:27,285
I'm close. I got it.

124
00:11:57,950 --> 00:11:59,784
What are we doing here?

125
00:11:59,786 --> 00:12:02,587
I'll be just a minute.
You stay here in the car.

126
00:12:51,037 --> 00:12:53,471
I don't want to have
to deal with him again!

127
00:12:54,373 --> 00:12:56,508
I don't want
to deal with it!

128
00:12:56,510 --> 00:12:58,443
No, but I don't want him
in the house!

129
00:12:58,445 --> 00:13:00,011
Come on, come on,
come on!

130
00:13:00,013 --> 00:13:01,613
He's not in the house now,
all right?

131
00:13:01,615 --> 00:13:02,814
He's not in the house now.

132
00:13:02,816 --> 00:13:04,115
No!

133
00:13:05,685 --> 00:13:07,852
I don't want him here anymore!
Where are you headed, maddie?

134
00:13:07,854 --> 00:13:09,954
I don't want him
in this house!
Where are you headed?

135
00:13:09,956 --> 00:13:12,590
I don't want him
in this house!
I know...

136
00:13:12,592 --> 00:13:14,526
I don't want him
in this house anymore!

137
00:13:16,295 --> 00:13:18,997
No! I want him out!

138
00:13:18,999 --> 00:13:20,465
Okay, okay...

139
00:13:20,467 --> 00:13:22,300
They're pushing him around...

140
00:13:22,302 --> 00:13:23,601
Who are you?

141
00:13:23,603 --> 00:13:24,969
It was just your boy here?

142
00:13:24,971 --> 00:13:27,372
No! No!
There were no people here!
Huh?

143
00:13:27,374 --> 00:13:28,840
I'm a...

144
00:13:29,441 --> 00:13:31,543
Reporter.

145
00:13:31,545 --> 00:13:34,012
I can't do it!

146
00:13:34,014 --> 00:13:35,513
Reporter?

147
00:13:36,749 --> 00:13:38,416
From where?

148
00:13:38,418 --> 00:13:39,851
I can't do it! I can't do it!

149
00:13:40,186 --> 00:13:41,553
No!

150
00:13:43,422 --> 00:13:44,923
No!

151
00:13:44,925 --> 00:13:47,592
You come all the way
from somewhere to see me?

152
00:13:48,961 --> 00:13:51,563
Oh, I'm with Gloria.

153
00:13:51,565 --> 00:13:53,398
- They were here!
- Maddie, who was here?

154
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:55,700
Were there other people here?
There was other people here?

155
00:13:55,702 --> 00:13:57,368
Yeah, is she going
to take her?

156
00:13:57,870 --> 00:14:00,405
I don't know.

157
00:14:00,407 --> 00:14:01,773
Yeah, she got
to take her.

158
00:14:02,575 --> 00:14:04,809
She needs some
authority, man.

159
00:14:04,811 --> 00:14:05,977
She's mad.

160
00:14:07,379 --> 00:14:09,480
Maybe
you should report that,

161
00:14:09,482 --> 00:14:11,015
then maybe someone will...

162
00:14:13,152 --> 00:14:15,553
What's that accent?

163
00:14:15,555 --> 00:14:18,223
You said where you were from,
but I... I forgot.

164
00:14:18,225 --> 00:14:20,992
Oh, here she comes.

165
00:14:20,994 --> 00:14:22,594
- Here she comes.
- Whoa! Whoa!

166
00:14:22,596 --> 00:14:23,795
Huh? Huh?
Whoa! Whoa!

167
00:14:23,797 --> 00:14:26,331
Oh, now she's a penitent!

168
00:14:26,333 --> 00:14:29,500
A minute ago she's doling out
some weak-ass sub-ninja shit

169
00:14:29,502 --> 00:14:31,269
with a kitchen knife,
and now look at her.

170
00:14:31,271 --> 00:14:32,704
Lindsay, would you just
calm down.

171
00:14:32,706 --> 00:14:33,938
Fuck that.

172
00:14:33,940 --> 00:14:36,074
Osman, could you please
get back to the car?

173
00:14:36,076 --> 00:14:38,443
Yeah, I can take care
of myself, mama!
Please, I asked you to stay...

174
00:14:38,445 --> 00:14:39,811
Hey!

175
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:42,847
Calm down now, huh?
Okay, it's me.

176
00:14:42,849 --> 00:14:45,617
Hey! Hey!
Hey! Hey! Hey!

177
00:14:45,619 --> 00:14:47,418
Whoa! Easy!

178
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:49,387
Take that,
foreign correspondent!

179
00:14:49,389 --> 00:14:50,989
Lindsay, let him go!

180
00:14:50,991 --> 00:14:53,258
Oh, come on, glor! Come on!
Let him go!

181
00:14:53,260 --> 00:14:54,626
Ah, fuck it!

182
00:14:55,728 --> 00:14:57,996
Fuck it!
You okay, mama?

183
00:14:57,998 --> 00:14:59,564
Huh?

184
00:15:00,232 --> 00:15:02,967
You okay? Huh?

185
00:15:02,969 --> 00:15:06,037
He hurt you? Did he hurt you?
Are you okay?

186
00:15:06,039 --> 00:15:07,705
You going to be
all right, maddie?

187
00:15:10,210 --> 00:15:13,311
Why don't you guys go in
and get some rest, all right?

188
00:15:13,313 --> 00:15:16,648
To the car.
To the car.

189
00:15:16,650 --> 00:15:18,683
- Hey. Mr. reporter man.
- Don't turn back.

190
00:15:18,685 --> 00:15:21,052
Just walk. Just walk.
If you report any of this,
i will kill you.

191
00:15:22,621 --> 00:15:24,656
Come on, come on.

192
00:15:25,424 --> 00:15:28,126
Up, up, up, up, up.

193
00:15:28,128 --> 00:15:29,761
All right, all right.

194
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:43,441
Let's see,
what do we got here?

195
00:15:44,076 --> 00:15:45,209
Let me see.

196
00:15:46,111 --> 00:15:48,646
Back home,
if she had brothers,

197
00:15:48,648 --> 00:15:50,214
they would go
to his house tomorrow

198
00:15:50,216 --> 00:15:51,783
and they would put him
in the ground.

199
00:15:53,118 --> 00:15:55,753
Nah, Lindsay's not bad
when he's not high.

200
00:15:58,190 --> 00:15:59,724
And when he is,

201
00:15:59,726 --> 00:16:03,027
he's a truly
impressive magnet for
heartache and trouble.

202
00:16:04,697 --> 00:16:07,598
The man can build
a damn fine hot tub.

203
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:12,070
Finds all the wood
himself.

204
00:16:12,072 --> 00:16:16,708
Yes, well,
i don't think it is talent
to find wood in the forest.

205
00:16:20,346 --> 00:16:21,980
He'll apologize to you.

206
00:16:28,087 --> 00:16:31,055
Hey, osman.

207
00:16:31,057 --> 00:16:32,824
What?

208
00:16:34,059 --> 00:16:35,827
I like you.

209
00:16:35,829 --> 00:16:37,996
I wasn't sure at first.

210
00:16:37,998 --> 00:16:41,065
But it's nice
to see you angry.

211
00:16:43,802 --> 00:16:46,904
Hey, no heroics
in the future.

212
00:16:48,807 --> 00:16:50,742
We can take care
of ourselves.

213
00:16:51,443 --> 00:16:52,977
Good night.

214
00:17:09,428 --> 00:17:12,296
Police blotter?
That fucker.

215
00:17:12,298 --> 00:17:13,564
<i> I'm not complaining.</i>

216
00:17:13,566 --> 00:17:16,300
<i> I'm just...</i>
Deferent as hell
when I called.

217
00:17:16,302 --> 00:17:17,802
"Yeah, sure, Gabe.
Anything you need.

218
00:17:17,804 --> 00:17:21,439
"Your piece
in the<i> times magazine</i>
tore my heart out."

219
00:17:21,441 --> 00:17:23,541
I'll bet he didn't even
read it.

220
00:17:23,543 --> 00:17:25,343
Oh, he read it.

221
00:17:25,345 --> 00:17:29,514
It tore his heart out.
He wanted very much
to make sure that I was okay.

222
00:17:29,516 --> 00:17:31,516
You going to go crazy
over there, man?

223
00:17:31,518 --> 00:17:33,084
<i> Look, I got a few friends</i>
<i> in New York that can...</i>

224
00:17:33,086 --> 00:17:36,587
No, Gabe.
I'm not going to go crazy.

225
00:17:36,589 --> 00:17:38,556
<i> Not if...</i>
Not if you have
something to do.

226
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:42,827
Not if I have
something to do.

227
00:17:42,829 --> 00:17:44,629
The market,
airport road.

228
00:17:44,631 --> 00:17:45,797
Osman, I got to go.

229
00:17:45,799 --> 00:17:47,398
Your understudy's
giving me the eye.

230
00:17:48,233 --> 00:17:50,134
Yeah, I think, uh...

231
00:17:50,136 --> 00:17:52,103
I think your mother
wants to talk to you.

232
00:17:52,105 --> 00:17:53,805
<i> I'd rather not, buddy.</i>

233
00:17:53,807 --> 00:17:56,974
It's easier not dealing
with her fretting over me,
if you know what I mean.

234
00:17:56,976 --> 00:18:00,545
Look, stay strong.
You're a badass, man.
You're a fixer, huh?

235
00:18:00,547 --> 00:18:03,481
<i> California can't possibly</i>
<i> defeat you, huh?</i>

236
00:18:03,483 --> 00:18:05,750
<i> Own it, brother. You know?</i>
<i> You hear what I'm saying?</i>

237
00:18:05,752 --> 00:18:06,884
<i> Own it.</i>

238
00:18:08,487 --> 00:18:09,554
Gabe?

239
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:16,160
He had to go to work.

240
00:18:17,396 --> 00:18:18,663
I'm going to go get
some cigarettes.

241
00:18:18,665 --> 00:18:20,631
Can I get you anything?
Where is he?

242
00:18:20,633 --> 00:18:22,433
I haven't heard
from him since...

243
00:18:26,004 --> 00:18:27,605
It's a mile-and-a-half
away.

244
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:37,181
Hello.

245
00:18:37,816 --> 00:18:39,283
May I help you?

246
00:18:39,285 --> 00:18:40,384
Yes, a pack of reds, please.

247
00:18:43,088 --> 00:18:44,555
Don't think we have those.

248
00:18:47,759 --> 00:18:48,826
Uh...

249
00:18:49,895 --> 00:18:51,629
Okay.

250
00:18:51,631 --> 00:18:57,268
Is there a grown person
i could talk to here?

251
00:18:59,004 --> 00:19:00,571
No?
There a problem?

252
00:19:00,573 --> 00:19:01,973
Ah, yes.

253
00:19:06,211 --> 00:19:09,046
I don't think
she can reach the cigarettes.

254
00:19:10,449 --> 00:19:11,749
Oh, dear.

255
00:19:12,451 --> 00:19:13,985
Brand?

256
00:19:13,987 --> 00:19:15,319
Reds, please.

257
00:19:16,822 --> 00:19:18,789
Just these, lace,
and the cigarettes.
Thank you.

258
00:19:18,791 --> 00:19:20,091
No...

259
00:19:20,993 --> 00:19:22,527
Shut up.

260
00:19:32,271 --> 00:19:33,838
Thank you
for the cigarettes.

261
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,640
Oh, yeah.
No worries.

262
00:19:37,142 --> 00:19:41,145
I've been recently told
that I have to own it,
and...

263
00:19:41,147 --> 00:19:43,681
Uh-huh?

264
00:19:43,683 --> 00:19:46,217
I think that means
i should talk to you.

265
00:19:48,153 --> 00:19:50,188
Um, what are you
supposed to own?

266
00:19:54,293 --> 00:19:55,626
I have no idea.

267
00:19:58,063 --> 00:19:59,397
Okay.

268
00:19:59,399 --> 00:20:01,165
I'm Sandra, by the way.

269
00:20:01,167 --> 00:20:04,202
Sandra. Osman.

270
00:20:04,204 --> 00:20:06,771
I like that.
Where are you from?

271
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:11,442
Carl, we're going
to the beach.

272
00:20:11,444 --> 00:20:13,110
Are we?
Uh-huh.

273
00:20:13,112 --> 00:20:15,513
This is osman.
He's from Afghanistan,

274
00:20:15,515 --> 00:20:17,815
and he hasn't seen
the water yet.

275
00:20:17,817 --> 00:20:20,184
Also, he really dug
your play.

276
00:20:21,486 --> 00:20:22,987
Well, then,

277
00:20:22,989 --> 00:20:24,488
we'll go to the beach.

278
00:20:29,595 --> 00:20:31,696
So, osman...

279
00:20:32,998 --> 00:20:34,599
Yes?

280
00:20:34,601 --> 00:20:35,900
What are you doing in my Van?

281
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:38,169
I don't know.

282
00:20:38,171 --> 00:20:39,971
Yet.

283
00:20:39,973 --> 00:20:41,205
You don't know yet.

284
00:20:45,010 --> 00:20:46,911
So, you worked with Gabe?

285
00:20:46,913 --> 00:20:49,280
Yeah, I was his fixer. We...

286
00:20:49,282 --> 00:20:50,581
Like an interpreter?

287
00:20:51,149 --> 00:20:52,450
Yes.

288
00:20:54,319 --> 00:20:58,656
In Afghanistan, it is all
about the relationships.

289
00:20:58,658 --> 00:21:01,726
A journalist
cannot walk around

290
00:21:01,728 --> 00:21:04,395
the country
just asking the questions.

291
00:21:04,397 --> 00:21:05,863
You need a guide.

292
00:21:05,865 --> 00:21:09,667
Yeah. Someone who know
how to read the place.

293
00:21:09,669 --> 00:21:13,137
A kind of cultural translator.
Yeah, exactly.

294
00:21:13,139 --> 00:21:14,472
So, what happened?

295
00:21:15,574 --> 00:21:17,041
I got the hell out.

296
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:21,946
No, Gabe had a connection,
so I got lucky.

297
00:21:23,181 --> 00:21:24,682
Hey, Gabe
still helping you out?

298
00:21:27,152 --> 00:21:30,021
Yeah, I'm staying
with his mother,

299
00:21:30,023 --> 00:21:33,691
and thought
he find me a job, but...

300
00:21:33,693 --> 00:21:35,326
Really?

301
00:21:35,328 --> 00:21:36,894
Maybe it's stupid.

302
00:21:38,563 --> 00:21:40,398
The police blotter
for the newspaper.

303
00:21:41,466 --> 00:21:43,434
It isn't anything.

304
00:21:43,436 --> 00:21:45,369
Yeah, I know what it is.

305
00:21:45,371 --> 00:21:47,605
You'd like something
more substantial.

306
00:21:47,607 --> 00:21:49,073
Yes.

307
00:21:49,075 --> 00:21:50,941
Something that lets you
assert yourself,

308
00:21:50,943 --> 00:21:52,310
makes you feel like
a man.

309
00:21:53,612 --> 00:21:55,179
Something
that gives you dignity,

310
00:21:55,181 --> 00:21:57,782
"dignity" being kind of
a nebulous concept right now,

311
00:21:57,784 --> 00:22:00,184
since it's got
a different flavor over here

312
00:22:00,186 --> 00:22:03,754
than it did back home,
or seems to,

313
00:22:03,756 --> 00:22:07,658
but you're not sure,
because how do you know yet?

314
00:22:08,794 --> 00:22:10,161
That right?

315
00:22:13,765 --> 00:22:15,366
Well, it's just
that back home...

316
00:22:15,368 --> 00:22:17,301
No, don't tell us
too much.

317
00:22:17,803 --> 00:22:19,103
Not yet.

318
00:22:23,008 --> 00:22:24,375
Okay.

319
00:22:38,423 --> 00:22:40,491
Okay, fuck it.
I'm getting in!

320
00:22:57,376 --> 00:22:59,810
I'm happy
you bring me here, man.

321
00:23:01,614 --> 00:23:03,347
Osman, come on!

322
00:23:06,485 --> 00:23:08,185
Go ahead.

323
00:23:08,187 --> 00:23:09,520
I'll chaperone.

324
00:23:11,656 --> 00:23:13,257
Whoo!

325
00:23:13,725 --> 00:23:15,426
Hey, osman!

326
00:23:15,827 --> 00:23:17,094
Come on!

327
00:23:30,209 --> 00:23:31,642
You all right, buddy?

328
00:23:33,445 --> 00:23:34,845
Whoo-hoo!

329
00:23:38,483 --> 00:23:39,717
You okay?

330
00:23:41,987 --> 00:23:43,754
Thank you.
That better?

331
00:23:44,589 --> 00:23:45,956
Is he all right?

332
00:23:46,858 --> 00:23:48,025
He's fine!

333
00:23:56,669 --> 00:23:58,502
Osman!

334
00:24:01,373 --> 00:24:02,573
Whoo!

335
00:24:07,712 --> 00:24:09,079
Whoo!

336
00:24:17,789 --> 00:24:19,423
Gloria!

337
00:24:19,425 --> 00:24:20,991
Well, where have you been?

338
00:24:20,993 --> 00:24:22,426
The sea.

339
00:24:22,428 --> 00:24:24,395
I have been to the sea.

340
00:24:24,397 --> 00:24:25,629
You liked it.

341
00:24:25,631 --> 00:24:28,999
Oh, Gabe was right.
All I need
is something to do.

342
00:24:29,001 --> 00:24:30,634
Is that what he said?

343
00:24:30,636 --> 00:24:31,936
I'm going to take the job.

344
00:24:31,938 --> 00:24:33,671
What, the police blotter?
Yeah.

345
00:24:33,673 --> 00:24:36,307
I thought you said
you didn't want to sit around
writing reports.

346
00:24:36,309 --> 00:24:38,342
Exactly.
I don't need to wait

347
00:24:38,344 --> 00:24:40,077
for people to give
me things, right?

348
00:24:40,079 --> 00:24:43,214
I can go out
and actually do something.

349
00:24:43,216 --> 00:24:46,050
I'm going to use it
to meet this place,
the people,

350
00:24:46,052 --> 00:24:48,452
do real work
like Gabe and I did.

351
00:24:48,454 --> 00:24:50,654
Osman, what are you
talking about?

352
00:24:50,656 --> 00:24:54,124
I'm going to go out on patrol
with you, Afghan-style.

353
00:24:54,126 --> 00:24:55,259
Huh?

354
00:24:55,261 --> 00:24:58,062
I'm not just going to write
the police blotter,

355
00:24:58,064 --> 00:24:59,230
I'm going to do it.
Osman...

356
00:24:59,232 --> 00:25:01,398
Turn this bullshit job
into real work.

357
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:03,400
Osman, you can't.

358
00:25:03,402 --> 00:25:06,804
You can't go out with me,
as delightful as you may be.

359
00:25:06,806 --> 00:25:10,441
But...
One, it's totally
against the rules.

360
00:25:10,443 --> 00:25:13,210
Last night...
And two, it interferes.

361
00:25:14,513 --> 00:25:16,847
I can't have you with me
out there when I'm working.

362
00:25:16,849 --> 00:25:18,582
I can't.
I... I wouldn't interfere.

363
00:25:18,584 --> 00:25:20,050
I'd be in the back...
No.

364
00:25:22,888 --> 00:25:24,121
I'm sorry.

365
00:25:26,191 --> 00:25:28,125
Here. Sit.

366
00:25:30,629 --> 00:25:32,830
It's the only thing
i can actually cook.

367
00:25:39,070 --> 00:25:42,072
You... you don't
need me to be here.

368
00:25:42,074 --> 00:25:44,108
You know that, right?

369
00:25:55,288 --> 00:25:57,054
<i> We should do the interview</i>
<i> when we're done this, right?</i>

370
00:25:57,056 --> 00:25:58,956
<i> Yeah, man. Yeah.</i>

371
00:25:58,958 --> 00:26:02,660
Many people say
the Taliban receive support

372
00:26:02,662 --> 00:26:04,962
from the
Pakistani government.

373
00:26:06,598 --> 00:26:09,433
Does the Taliban
receive support
from Pakistan?

374
00:26:09,435 --> 00:26:10,968
Come on.

375
00:26:39,197 --> 00:26:40,831
He's actually affirming

376
00:26:40,833 --> 00:26:43,233
that the Pakistani government
helps them,

377
00:26:43,235 --> 00:26:44,835
and did nothing
against them.

378
00:26:44,837 --> 00:26:47,304
They got many offices
at the border...
Hmm.

379
00:26:47,306 --> 00:26:49,740
...and that's how they operate
their operation.

380
00:26:49,742 --> 00:26:53,844
Right.
What is the structure?
Shit, man.

381
00:26:53,846 --> 00:26:56,747
That sounds like...
Like a detective aircraft.

382
00:26:56,749 --> 00:26:58,015
That sounds
like a detective aircraft.

383
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:02,620
Should we go?
He's actually saying

384
00:27:02,622 --> 00:27:03,921
that it's
an American aircraft,

385
00:27:03,923 --> 00:27:05,389
so we should just
wrap things up.

386
00:27:05,391 --> 00:27:06,991
So, we should go?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

387
00:27:06,993 --> 00:27:08,392
Let's just wrap things up.
Tell him
thank you very much.

388
00:27:08,394 --> 00:27:09,526
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

389
00:27:17,569 --> 00:27:20,170
Go, man.

390
00:27:20,172 --> 00:27:21,605
Go!

391
00:27:24,976 --> 00:27:27,511
Oh, shit.

392
00:27:27,513 --> 00:27:29,079
Go, go, go!

393
00:27:29,581 --> 00:27:30,714
Go! Go! Move!

394
00:27:34,553 --> 00:27:36,153
Gabe?

395
00:27:53,004 --> 00:27:55,172
Whoo!

396
00:29:15,253 --> 00:29:17,721
Thank you.
No problem,
brother.

397
00:29:17,723 --> 00:29:20,257
Hey, foreign correspondent.

398
00:29:20,959 --> 00:29:22,626
You here to report me?

399
00:29:22,628 --> 00:29:25,162
I'm just fucking with you.

400
00:29:25,164 --> 00:29:27,464
I'm just messing around.
Come on, get in.

401
00:29:28,133 --> 00:29:30,167
Look, I owe you.

402
00:29:30,169 --> 00:29:34,471
That shit the other night,
my bad, all right?

403
00:29:34,473 --> 00:29:37,207
Serious misuse
of a sacred martial art.

404
00:29:37,209 --> 00:29:38,776
I own that.

405
00:29:38,778 --> 00:29:41,745
I apologize.
Come on.

406
00:29:41,747 --> 00:29:44,148
Man, I ain't going
to touch you.

407
00:29:44,150 --> 00:29:46,049
You sit on that side,
i sit on this side.

408
00:29:46,051 --> 00:29:47,951
Come on.

409
00:29:49,454 --> 00:29:51,789
All right,
it's cool.

410
00:30:01,499 --> 00:30:03,333
Man, no problem at all.

411
00:30:03,335 --> 00:30:05,235
No problem at all.
You just...

412
00:30:05,237 --> 00:30:08,071
Anywhere you want to go,
just say the word, brother.

413
00:30:08,073 --> 00:30:10,240
No, man, you'd be doing me
a favor.

414
00:30:10,242 --> 00:30:12,576
That karmic rebound.
Seriously.

415
00:30:12,578 --> 00:30:14,578
Where do you want to go?

416
00:30:15,313 --> 00:30:19,483
I have to go downtown.

417
00:30:19,485 --> 00:30:21,752
"Downtown" is kind of
a vague direction.

418
00:30:24,222 --> 00:30:27,491
Well, I...
I have work to do.

419
00:30:27,493 --> 00:30:28,959
Yeah?

420
00:30:28,961 --> 00:30:31,228
Something going on
i should know about?

421
00:30:31,230 --> 00:30:32,629
You got a scoop?

422
00:30:33,431 --> 00:30:35,332
No, no.

423
00:30:36,167 --> 00:30:37,734
Oh, yeah?

424
00:30:37,736 --> 00:30:39,837
So, what are you
working on?

425
00:30:42,106 --> 00:30:43,640
The police blotter.

426
00:30:43,642 --> 00:30:45,242
No shit?

427
00:30:45,244 --> 00:30:47,010
Fucking love it, man.

428
00:30:47,012 --> 00:30:48,812
First thing I read
every morning.

429
00:30:48,814 --> 00:30:50,480
Really?
Yeah.

430
00:30:50,482 --> 00:30:52,950
Love all that dirty
underbelly stuff.

431
00:30:52,952 --> 00:30:56,019
You know, the last dude that
wrote the blotter was stellar.

432
00:30:56,021 --> 00:30:58,188
Frankie the finger.
Frankie the finger, man.

433
00:30:58,190 --> 00:31:00,390
He wrote me up
a couple times.

434
00:31:00,392 --> 00:31:02,459
Yeah, but he had
the perfect tone, you know?

435
00:31:02,461 --> 00:31:05,262
Wry as a motherfucker.

436
00:31:05,264 --> 00:31:08,265
Like a laser beam,
you know?

437
00:31:08,267 --> 00:31:10,868
You got some... you got
some shoes to fill, my friend.

438
00:31:10,870 --> 00:31:12,769
I can fill
some shoes, man.

439
00:31:12,771 --> 00:31:15,439
I'll bet you can.

440
00:31:16,841 --> 00:31:18,275
So, the idea is what?

441
00:31:18,277 --> 00:31:21,245
You head into town,
do a little recon,

442
00:31:21,247 --> 00:31:23,647
pin the likely criminals,
and then you just hide out

443
00:31:23,649 --> 00:31:25,515
and wait for them
to do something nefarious?

444
00:31:25,517 --> 00:31:28,785
Something like recon.

445
00:31:29,754 --> 00:31:32,155
In this work, it's...

446
00:31:32,157 --> 00:31:34,958
It's all about finding
the source of things, yes.

447
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:36,994
No shit?

448
00:31:36,996 --> 00:31:39,663
What's a dude from
Afghanistan doing out here

449
00:31:39,665 --> 00:31:41,932
in the this godforsaken
part of the country?

450
00:31:42,467 --> 00:31:43,934
Journalism.

451
00:31:44,903 --> 00:31:46,270
Afghan-style.

452
00:31:46,272 --> 00:31:48,205
Oh-ho!

453
00:31:48,207 --> 00:31:51,375
Ho! Well, you got
in the right car, brother.

454
00:31:51,377 --> 00:31:52,809
Right car.
Whoa!

455
00:31:54,113 --> 00:31:55,178
Oh!

456
00:31:56,915 --> 00:31:59,516
Stop it. Hey, stop.
Hey, man! What are you...

457
00:31:59,518 --> 00:32:01,285
Come on, man. Drive.

458
00:32:01,287 --> 00:32:03,220
Got the leg.

459
00:32:03,222 --> 00:32:05,255
That's a goddamn
tickle monster.

460
00:32:21,372 --> 00:32:24,174
It has to be
something dynamic.

461
00:32:24,176 --> 00:32:26,777
Present tense,
as Gabe liked to say.

462
00:32:26,779 --> 00:32:29,446
Something small that shows us
the bigger thing.

463
00:32:29,448 --> 00:32:31,682
Like a crime in progress.
Exactly.

464
00:32:31,684 --> 00:32:33,050
The moment after

465
00:32:33,052 --> 00:32:34,718
something terrible
has happened

466
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:35,852
is very strange,
you know.

467
00:32:35,854 --> 00:32:39,623
There has been a...
A break in the life,

468
00:32:40,992 --> 00:32:43,226
a hole in the world.

469
00:32:43,228 --> 00:32:44,861
Does that make sense?
I can say it like this?

470
00:32:44,863 --> 00:32:47,631
Oh, yeah, man. Makes sense.
A hole in the world.

471
00:32:47,633 --> 00:32:49,232
Yeah.

472
00:32:49,234 --> 00:32:52,803
Sometimes you can see
inside of this hole.

473
00:32:55,206 --> 00:32:57,007
Sometimes you can't.

474
00:32:59,510 --> 00:33:01,111
All right, I got it.

475
00:33:01,113 --> 00:33:05,048
How about
you hide out in the...
In the apple orchard

476
00:33:05,050 --> 00:33:06,950
behind the snapple plant,

477
00:33:06,952 --> 00:33:09,820
wait for the cops to drag out
some petty crook out there

478
00:33:09,822 --> 00:33:11,455
and beat the crap
out of him.

479
00:33:11,457 --> 00:33:14,758
You write that shit up tight!
Tight!

480
00:33:17,195 --> 00:33:18,462
This really happened?

481
00:33:18,464 --> 00:33:20,030
Oh, yeah.

482
00:33:20,032 --> 00:33:22,366
Happened to a fucking friend
of mine from high school.

483
00:33:22,368 --> 00:33:24,167
Just made a little speed

484
00:33:24,169 --> 00:33:26,536
till they showed up one night
at his kitchen table,

485
00:33:26,538 --> 00:33:29,172
jacked his shit,
brought him out there,

486
00:33:29,174 --> 00:33:31,074
worked him over
into the fujis.

487
00:33:31,076 --> 00:33:33,844
Good, man.
That's good.

488
00:33:33,846 --> 00:33:36,179
Uh... what else you got?

489
00:33:37,782 --> 00:33:40,083
Well, there's
the sokurov brothers

490
00:33:40,085 --> 00:33:42,452
out in the
guerneville hills.

491
00:33:42,454 --> 00:33:44,388
The cops think
they're a bunch of freaks

492
00:33:44,390 --> 00:33:46,423
that are into
biodynamic gardening

493
00:33:46,425 --> 00:33:49,026
and making their own jam,
but truth be told,

494
00:33:49,028 --> 00:33:51,294
them's the dirtiest
fucking family

495
00:33:51,296 --> 00:33:53,230
since them gotti dudes.

496
00:33:53,232 --> 00:33:54,731
Except they're skinny
as little girls,

497
00:33:54,733 --> 00:33:56,800
and they shoot
their own meat.

498
00:33:57,735 --> 00:33:59,269
Hey, hey, hey.

499
00:33:59,271 --> 00:34:02,606
You got to quote that
"not for attribution," man.

500
00:34:02,608 --> 00:34:07,277
"'Skinny as little girls,'
said some unidentified
local craftsman."

501
00:34:09,213 --> 00:34:10,647
You said this is all about

502
00:34:10,649 --> 00:34:13,417
getting to the source
of things, right?

503
00:34:13,419 --> 00:34:14,785
Yeah.

504
00:34:16,154 --> 00:34:18,789
Yeah, downtown
ain't the place to start.

505
00:34:46,984 --> 00:34:48,618
Here we go.

506
00:34:50,855 --> 00:34:52,222
Ah.

507
00:34:53,858 --> 00:34:55,759
Uh, who lives here again?

508
00:34:55,761 --> 00:34:58,595
Oh, just old friends
of a sort.

509
00:34:58,597 --> 00:35:01,698
And what does this
have to do with anything?

510
00:35:01,700 --> 00:35:03,667
Oh, you know, man.
You got to...

511
00:35:03,669 --> 00:35:05,869
You're the blotter dude.
You got to meet the locals.

512
00:35:05,871 --> 00:35:08,572
You know,
get lay of the land,
all that, right?

513
00:35:08,574 --> 00:35:11,842
Plus, bro, she is going
to love you, man.

514
00:35:11,844 --> 00:35:13,210
She's going to love you,
all right?

515
00:35:13,212 --> 00:35:16,079
Just give me 10 minutes here
and we're done, all right?

516
00:35:16,081 --> 00:35:18,682
Come on, bro.
You and me, right?

517
00:35:18,684 --> 00:35:20,550
Right? Right?

518
00:35:20,552 --> 00:35:22,152
Right?
Okay, okay, okay.

519
00:35:22,154 --> 00:35:24,888
Hey.
Ha-ha!

520
00:35:24,890 --> 00:35:27,591
Ha-ha! Ho!

521
00:35:27,593 --> 00:35:29,960
All right, all right,
all right, all right, cool.

522
00:35:29,962 --> 00:35:32,329
Karen!

523
00:35:32,331 --> 00:35:34,331
Hey, I want you
to meet somebody.

524
00:35:34,333 --> 00:35:35,999
Hey, Dougie fresh.
Karen here?

525
00:35:36,001 --> 00:35:37,868
Lindsay!
Hey, Mario, man,

526
00:35:37,870 --> 00:35:38,969
I got to talk to her,
okay, bro?

527
00:35:38,971 --> 00:35:41,104
Come on, man.

528
00:35:41,106 --> 00:35:43,273
Yo, meet this guy.
This is osman.

529
00:35:43,275 --> 00:35:45,642
Hi. Hello.
Osman. I like that.

530
00:35:45,644 --> 00:35:47,978
You hungry?
Uh, no, thank you.

531
00:35:47,980 --> 00:35:50,680
Osman, meet my wife,
Suzie.

532
00:35:50,682 --> 00:35:52,315
Are you even
supposed to be here?
Hey, chill, bro.

533
00:35:52,317 --> 00:35:54,851
No, Doug, he most definitely
is not supposed to be here.

534
00:35:54,853 --> 00:35:57,287
This is Doug. Doug's mad
because he's grounded.

535
00:35:57,289 --> 00:35:58,822
Came home from school
drunk yesterday.

536
00:35:58,824 --> 00:36:00,357
Hey, two true statements,
douche bag.

537
00:36:00,359 --> 00:36:02,259
One, I was at school,
and two, I came home.

538
00:36:02,261 --> 00:36:04,161
Hey, Mario worked
for your paper, man.

539
00:36:04,163 --> 00:36:05,795
He does the local arts,
right?

540
00:36:05,797 --> 00:36:07,797
You work for the paper?
Police blotter.

541
00:36:07,799 --> 00:36:09,466
Oh, right. You're him.

542
00:36:09,468 --> 00:36:11,468
Afghanistan. Welcome.

543
00:36:11,470 --> 00:36:13,003
What happened
to Frankie the finger?

544
00:36:13,005 --> 00:36:15,472
The finger's gone, man.
O-man is in.

545
00:36:15,474 --> 00:36:17,474
We're taking this
to another level, right?

546
00:36:17,476 --> 00:36:19,242
Yo, we're partners now.
Right? Right?

547
00:36:19,244 --> 00:36:21,511
Well, I think...
Hey, where's she at, man?

548
00:36:21,513 --> 00:36:23,480
She upstairs?
She upstairs?

549
00:36:23,482 --> 00:36:25,182
Karen!

550
00:36:25,184 --> 00:36:28,885
Uh, well, I was planning on
expanding on the coverage...

551
00:36:28,887 --> 00:36:30,287
Oh, that's great,
because Mario here

552
00:36:30,289 --> 00:36:32,289
couldn't cover up a strip
of litmus paper with his dick.

553
00:36:32,291 --> 00:36:33,790
Hey, Doug,
that's just nonsense.

554
00:36:33,792 --> 00:36:34,858
Two quarters in the jar.

555
00:36:34,860 --> 00:36:36,493
Hey, Mario, can...
Can I go upstairs?

556
00:36:36,495 --> 00:36:37,694
I wouldn't
if I were you.

557
00:36:37,696 --> 00:36:40,297
Fuck, man.

558
00:36:40,299 --> 00:36:41,998
You look like a retarded
boy scout right now.

559
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,067
Doug, I happen to look
like your father.

560
00:36:44,069 --> 00:36:46,436
Hey, osman, what would
happen in Afghanistan

561
00:36:46,438 --> 00:36:48,171
if a kid spoke to
his father this way?

562
00:36:48,173 --> 00:36:49,339
Yeah, tell him.

563
00:36:49,341 --> 00:36:50,807
Well, he would be in trouble.

564
00:36:50,809 --> 00:36:53,410
He'd be in trouble.

565
00:36:53,412 --> 00:36:55,879
- Hi. Karen, hi.
- What are you doing here?

566
00:36:55,881 --> 00:36:57,047
What are you doing here,
Lindsay?

567
00:36:57,049 --> 00:36:58,815
Well, I thought I'd come by
and say hi...

568
00:36:58,817 --> 00:37:00,617
No, you can't just
come by and say hi anymore...

569
00:37:00,619 --> 00:37:02,552
I know, I know.
What the hell, guys?

570
00:37:02,554 --> 00:37:04,621
- No one said anything?
- I did.

571
00:37:04,623 --> 00:37:06,289
Hi.
And who the fuck are you?

572
00:37:06,291 --> 00:37:07,724
I'm osman.
Osman.

573
00:37:07,726 --> 00:37:10,360
Wonderful to be finally
meeting you, truly.
Yeah.

574
00:37:10,362 --> 00:37:13,396
Lindsay, he say the most
beautiful things about you.

575
00:37:13,398 --> 00:37:14,931
Yeah.
Lindsay.

576
00:37:14,933 --> 00:37:16,700
What?
Oh, my god.

577
00:37:16,702 --> 00:37:19,102
- Wait, Karen.
- What? What?

578
00:37:19,104 --> 00:37:21,504
- You have to go now.
- No, no.

579
00:37:21,506 --> 00:37:23,506
Look, I wanted
to introduce you.

580
00:37:23,508 --> 00:37:25,709
This guy is legit, okay?

581
00:37:25,711 --> 00:37:28,245
I'm working with him
and I thought, you know,

582
00:37:28,247 --> 00:37:31,414
maybe you could put in
a little word for me,
you know?

583
00:37:31,416 --> 00:37:32,983
Right?

584
00:37:32,985 --> 00:37:35,619
I'm sorry. I am.
Why?

585
00:37:35,621 --> 00:37:37,220
But I called Gary
when I saw you pull up.

586
00:37:37,222 --> 00:37:40,857
Oh, no. Why?
Why would you do that?

587
00:37:40,859 --> 00:37:43,760
You should take the back door.
Gary's going to be mad.

588
00:37:43,762 --> 00:37:45,428
- Lindsay?
- What?

589
00:37:45,430 --> 00:37:47,230
- We should go right now.
- Oh, man!

590
00:37:47,232 --> 00:37:49,065
Nice meeting you.
What?
You sent some people?

591
00:37:49,067 --> 00:37:51,301
What the hell, Karen?

592
00:37:51,303 --> 00:37:54,337
Still put in a word.
You can still do that, right?

593
00:37:55,740 --> 00:37:57,073
Hey, listen...

594
00:38:13,157 --> 00:38:14,658
Whoo!

595
00:38:31,676 --> 00:38:33,310
Lindsay!

596
00:38:40,117 --> 00:38:41,651
Lindsay!

597
00:38:57,568 --> 00:38:59,202
Lindsay.

598
00:39:01,439 --> 00:39:03,039
<i> Police blotter.</i>

599
00:39:03,041 --> 00:39:05,275
<i> Notes for September 6th.</i>

600
00:39:05,277 --> 00:39:07,377
<i> 5:15 P.M.</i>

601
00:39:07,379 --> 00:39:10,613
<i> Two men in the woods,</i>
<i> in pursuit.</i>

602
00:39:10,615 --> 00:39:15,018
<i> One wild man with glasses,</i>
<i> one skinny and mean.</i>

603
00:39:15,020 --> 00:39:18,688
<i> One unstable family,</i>
<i> one pig butchered indoors.</i>

604
00:39:18,690 --> 00:39:21,224
<i> Appears to be</i>
<i> a local custom.</i>

605
00:39:21,226 --> 00:39:23,660
<i> Must verify with the experts.</i>

606
00:39:23,662 --> 00:39:26,863
<i> One woman,</i>
<i> relationship unknown,</i>

607
00:39:26,865 --> 00:39:29,265

<i> I have my guesses.</i>

609
00:39:32,304 --> 00:39:36,339
<i> Gone, escaped,</i>

610
00:39:36,341 --> 00:39:37,707

612
00:39:39,744 --> 00:39:41,611

613
00:39:41,613 --> 00:39:43,546
<i> Running from who?</i>

614
00:39:48,619 --> 00:39:50,220
The...

615
00:39:51,389 --> 00:39:55,325
Unidentified...

616
00:39:56,761 --> 00:39:59,996
Local craftsman.

617
00:40:04,969 --> 00:40:07,203
What happened to you?

618
00:40:07,205 --> 00:40:08,371
I went to work.

619
00:40:13,944 --> 00:40:16,980
You were right, Gloria.
Yeah?

620
00:40:16,982 --> 00:40:19,149
I don't need you
to be here.

621
00:40:35,966 --> 00:40:39,269
Hello? Lindsay?

622
00:40:39,271 --> 00:40:41,738
It's the foreign
correspondent man.

623
00:40:41,740 --> 00:40:43,072
We have to talk.

624
00:41:36,060 --> 00:41:37,961
Get down! Down!

625
00:42:00,985 --> 00:42:02,585
Jesus Christ.

626
00:42:10,094 --> 00:42:12,061
Come on, Lindsay.
Everybody knew him.

627
00:42:12,063 --> 00:42:14,163
Not me, man.
Not me, man.

628
00:42:14,165 --> 00:42:15,565
I don't consort
with that kind of...

629
00:42:15,567 --> 00:42:17,333
You saw him yesterday.

630
00:42:17,335 --> 00:42:20,937
From a distance.
From a distance, man.

631
00:42:20,939 --> 00:42:23,706
Yeah? You talk to him?
You talk to anybody else?

632
00:42:23,708 --> 00:42:26,442
No, I didn't talk...
I wasn't there for anybody.

633
00:42:26,444 --> 00:42:28,244
I was there
for a little face time

634
00:42:28,246 --> 00:42:29,779
with my ex-old lady, man.

635
00:42:29,781 --> 00:42:31,447
This is insane.

636
00:42:39,189 --> 00:42:41,257
- Fucking bullshit! Fucking...
- Lindsay, wait.

637
00:42:41,259 --> 00:42:42,892
Lindsay.
Oh, man.

638
00:42:42,894 --> 00:42:44,928
Just get back, brother.
You don't want
any of this shit on you!

639
00:42:44,930 --> 00:42:46,863
Lindsay, what's going on?
Who was that man?

640
00:42:46,865 --> 00:42:48,932
Just a fucking Minion, man!
They get them to chase you

641
00:42:48,934 --> 00:42:50,033
and then they're fucking...
Who?

642
00:42:50,035 --> 00:42:52,502
Who does?
Just... fuck, man!

643
00:42:52,504 --> 00:42:54,037
I take one little drop

644
00:42:54,039 --> 00:42:56,239
out of their whole ocean
of fucking dirty scratch,

645
00:42:56,241 --> 00:42:58,107
and then
the fucking world ends.

646
00:42:58,109 --> 00:42:59,375
God damn it!

647
00:42:59,377 --> 00:43:00,810
You tell Gloria
he was chasing you?

648
00:43:00,812 --> 00:43:03,246
You think I'm going
to fucking tell the cops, man?

649
00:43:03,248 --> 00:43:05,682
It's three grand.
Not even four grand.

650
00:43:05,684 --> 00:43:07,784
Fuckers will put you down
for nothing, man.

651
00:43:07,786 --> 00:43:09,018
They put you under
for nothing!

652
00:43:09,020 --> 00:43:10,386
So, maybe
i don't understand,

653
00:43:10,388 --> 00:43:12,388
but I think your reaction
to this is a bit too strong.

654
00:43:12,390 --> 00:43:15,692
Two... two... two hundred
fucking yards
from my house, man.

655
00:43:15,694 --> 00:43:17,193
The fuckers are on me.

656
00:43:17,195 --> 00:43:19,562
Lindsay, you're not making
the complete sense
right now.

657
00:43:19,564 --> 00:43:24,000
Look, man, even if that was
a fucking accident,

658
00:43:24,002 --> 00:43:25,635
they're going to think
i had something to do with it.

659
00:43:25,637 --> 00:43:28,404
And they're going
to come at me hard.

660
00:43:28,406 --> 00:43:31,641
This is bad, man.
Very fucking bad!

661
00:43:33,210 --> 00:43:34,310
Fuck it!

662
00:43:35,879 --> 00:43:38,314
Listen to me.
Listen to me.

663
00:43:38,316 --> 00:43:41,050
I can help you, okay?

664
00:43:41,052 --> 00:43:42,619
I can help you,
but you have to tell me

665
00:43:42,621 --> 00:43:44,354
what it is that's going on.

666
00:43:46,624 --> 00:43:48,858
Look, you go home.

667
00:43:48,860 --> 00:43:50,760
I'll talk to Gloria,
see what she knows,

668
00:43:50,762 --> 00:43:52,729
and then you and I,
we can sit down,

669
00:43:52,731 --> 00:43:55,231
talk through this
and figure it out, okay?

670
00:43:56,100 --> 00:43:57,867
We can fix this.

671
00:44:00,037 --> 00:44:01,204
Promise?

672
00:44:02,039 --> 00:44:03,873
I promise.

673
00:44:05,743 --> 00:44:07,276
All right.

674
00:44:29,867 --> 00:44:31,100
Gloria.

675
00:44:31,102 --> 00:44:32,769
Not now, osman.
I got to run.

676
00:44:32,771 --> 00:44:35,238
Uh... uh...

677
00:44:36,874 --> 00:44:38,908
You want to come with me?

678
00:44:38,910 --> 00:44:40,777
Yeah.

679
00:44:40,779 --> 00:44:42,378
Yeah, hop in.

680
00:45:03,133 --> 00:45:04,801
Did you know the man?

681
00:45:04,803 --> 00:45:06,335
The dead guy?

682
00:45:06,337 --> 00:45:08,538
Not especially.

683
00:45:08,540 --> 00:45:11,474
His name was beaux.
With an x.

684
00:45:14,344 --> 00:45:16,379
It's cold in here.

685
00:45:18,215 --> 00:45:19,916
How do you think
he was killed?

686
00:45:19,918 --> 00:45:22,418
Hit and run, probably.

687
00:45:22,420 --> 00:45:24,387
So, what
are we doing here?

688
00:45:25,556 --> 00:45:28,725
Lindsay tell you
anything about him?

689
00:45:28,727 --> 00:45:30,259
I don't know what you...

690
00:45:31,829 --> 00:45:34,397
Yesterday.
You were with him, right?

691
00:45:34,399 --> 00:45:37,900
You see this guy?
Lindsay say anything
about him?

692
00:45:37,902 --> 00:45:40,570
No, nothing like that.

693
00:45:42,005 --> 00:45:44,140
He seen me on the side
of the road,

694
00:45:44,875 --> 00:45:46,809
gave me a ride downtown.

695
00:45:50,214 --> 00:45:53,883
He also apologized
for beating me.

696
00:45:57,354 --> 00:45:59,789
I imagine you've seen
a lot of this.

697
00:46:00,924 --> 00:46:02,225
A lot of death.

698
00:46:03,527 --> 00:46:04,927
Yes.

699
00:46:05,929 --> 00:46:07,663
With Gabe?

700
00:46:08,365 --> 00:46:10,500
Yes, sometimes.

701
00:46:12,836 --> 00:46:15,738
I don't imagine
it ever gets dull, does it?

702
00:46:16,273 --> 00:46:18,341
No, it doesn't.

703
00:46:23,514 --> 00:46:25,515
But this can make you
very tired.

704
00:46:31,588 --> 00:46:33,222
You asked what we were
doing here.

705
00:46:34,024 --> 00:46:36,325
Well, I have no idea.

706
00:46:38,262 --> 00:46:40,696
All I know is our dead guy
worked for people

707
00:46:40,698 --> 00:46:45,268
who are capable
of some truly unsavory things.

708
00:46:45,270 --> 00:46:47,970
And when someone
close to people like that

709
00:46:47,972 --> 00:46:49,472
ends up dead
by the side of the road,

710
00:46:49,474 --> 00:46:52,642
it kind of makes you want
to take a walk in the woods,

711
00:46:52,644 --> 00:46:54,544
if you know what I mean.

712
00:46:54,546 --> 00:46:56,379
So, who did he work for?

713
00:46:56,381 --> 00:46:58,548
A couple of guys
in the guerneville hills.

714
00:46:58,550 --> 00:47:01,350
Brothers, actually.
The sokurovs.

715
00:47:01,352 --> 00:47:03,719
You know, that kid
keeps torching the mailboxes,

716
00:47:03,721 --> 00:47:07,423
I am 90% sure
he's one of theirs.

717
00:47:07,425 --> 00:47:12,128
Word is one brother
actually set the other
on fire over a woman.

718
00:47:12,130 --> 00:47:13,963
Never could prove it,
though.

719
00:47:16,567 --> 00:47:17,900
Osman?

720
00:47:49,601 --> 00:47:51,567
This...

721
00:47:51,569 --> 00:47:54,737
This death must be
a very strange thing

722
00:47:54,739 --> 00:47:56,339
for this town.

723
00:47:56,341 --> 00:47:58,741
Osman...

724
00:47:58,743 --> 00:48:01,410
You're lovely,
but with all due respect,

725
00:48:03,113 --> 00:48:06,549
you couldn't possibly know
what's strange for this town.

726
00:48:48,992 --> 00:48:50,626
Lindsay?

727
00:48:52,663 --> 00:48:54,664
Lindsay?

728
00:49:16,253 --> 00:49:19,288
I just come
to talk to Lindsay.

729
00:49:22,460 --> 00:49:25,061
Stop! Stop! Stop!
No! Stop! Stop!

730
00:49:25,063 --> 00:49:27,296
Please! No!

731
00:49:28,999 --> 00:49:30,499
Where's Lindsay?

732
00:49:32,903 --> 00:49:34,003
He's gone.

733
00:49:36,506 --> 00:49:38,240
<i> She said... she said</i>
<i> they took him.</i>

734
00:49:38,242 --> 00:49:40,343
Who?
<i> Won't say.</i>

735
00:49:40,345 --> 00:49:42,545
Or doesn't know.

736
00:49:42,547 --> 00:49:44,113
<i> Is his truck there?</i>
What?

737
00:49:44,115 --> 00:49:46,048
His truck.
Do you see it?

738
00:49:46,050 --> 00:49:48,284
No, but...
<i> Okay, then.</i>

739
00:49:48,286 --> 00:49:50,486
Let's not jump
to conclusions.

740
00:49:50,488 --> 00:49:52,655
I mean, for all we know,
he could be on a beer run

741
00:49:52,657 --> 00:49:54,023
<i> or halfway</i>
<i> to Tahoe by now.</i>

742
00:49:54,025 --> 00:49:55,391
He said he'd be here.

743
00:49:55,393 --> 00:49:59,962
This is who they are, osman.
Unreliable.

744
00:49:59,964 --> 00:50:03,399
<i> Look, I'll be by</i>
<i> as soon as I can.</i>

745
00:50:03,401 --> 00:50:05,301
<i> Probably find him passed out</i>
<i> on the lawn.</i>

746
00:50:05,303 --> 00:50:07,336
Well, I hope you do.

747
00:50:07,338 --> 00:50:09,538
<i> And what the hell</i>
<i> are you doing</i>
<i> over there, anyway?</i>

748
00:50:09,540 --> 00:50:11,807
Actually, never mind that.

749
00:50:11,809 --> 00:50:16,112
Just go home and let us
take care of it our way, okay?

750
00:50:18,348 --> 00:50:19,515
<i> Okay?</i>

751
00:50:20,350 --> 00:50:22,218
Yeah, okay.

752
00:50:22,220 --> 00:50:23,786
Good.

753
00:50:25,122 --> 00:50:26,856
Are they coming?

754
00:50:33,430 --> 00:50:35,031
Can I borrow that?

755
00:52:15,966 --> 00:52:17,800
<i> Police blotter.</i>

756
00:52:17,802 --> 00:52:19,401
<i> September 8.</i>

757
00:52:20,604 --> 00:52:23,072
<i> A man is dead</i>
<i> on the side of the road.</i>

758
00:52:25,342 --> 00:52:27,343
<i> A hole has opened</i>
<i> in the earth.</i>

759
00:52:56,106 --> 00:52:57,173
Osman!

760
00:52:58,208 --> 00:53:00,442
Everybody, this is osman.

761
00:53:02,412 --> 00:53:04,480
Let's move them
into the plastiques.

762
00:53:09,052 --> 00:53:11,287
And don't get sucked
into patterns.

763
00:53:11,289 --> 00:53:14,690
Honest impulse, clear action.

764
00:53:14,692 --> 00:53:17,026
The forest run's next,
people.

765
00:53:19,829 --> 00:53:21,263
You look beat.

766
00:53:29,773 --> 00:53:31,874
What does Gloria say
about all this?

767
00:53:33,844 --> 00:53:35,911
She says nothing
means anything yet.

768
00:53:35,913 --> 00:53:38,080
And she's right.

769
00:53:38,082 --> 00:53:40,182
What, you think Lindsay
brained some guy with a rock

770
00:53:40,184 --> 00:53:43,052
and then got whisked away
by the big weeping dude?

771
00:53:43,054 --> 00:53:46,088
No. I have no idea.
That's the problem.

772
00:53:46,090 --> 00:53:48,023
You know, I'm a crime reporter
who doesn't know

773
00:53:48,025 --> 00:53:50,259
if a crime is actually
being committed.

774
00:53:51,895 --> 00:53:54,730
You have asylum here,
right?

775
00:53:54,732 --> 00:53:57,132
Which means you can never
go home, right?

776
00:53:57,134 --> 00:53:58,601
Not even for a visit.

777
00:53:59,936 --> 00:54:03,072
And if you do, that's it.
They revoke your status.

778
00:54:03,074 --> 00:54:04,907
Say you must not be in danger
in your home country

779
00:54:04,909 --> 00:54:06,442
if you choose to go back,
even for a week.

780
00:54:06,444 --> 00:54:07,710
Why are you asking me this?

781
00:54:07,712 --> 00:54:10,079
It seems like a lot
of pressure, that's all.

782
00:54:11,081 --> 00:54:12,648
I'm not quite sure what...

783
00:54:12,650 --> 00:54:15,417
I don't agree
with Gloria on much,
but she's right on this.

784
00:54:15,419 --> 00:54:18,454
First off,
Lindsay's mom is not well.

785
00:54:18,456 --> 00:54:20,256
And Lindsay,
he's a total disaster,

786
00:54:20,258 --> 00:54:21,957
but incapable of violence.

787
00:54:22,826 --> 00:54:24,593
You said it yourself.

788
00:54:24,595 --> 00:54:27,997
Nothing else, the man knows
how to run from danger.

789
00:54:27,999 --> 00:54:30,032
He is very quick.

790
00:54:30,034 --> 00:54:32,701
He freaked out
and left town.

791
00:54:32,703 --> 00:54:35,671
Or he's down at red's
recovery room getting tanked.

792
00:54:35,673 --> 00:54:38,474
He'll turn up.
He always does.

793
00:54:38,476 --> 00:54:41,110
Even when people
wish he wouldn't.

794
00:54:41,112 --> 00:54:43,779
What about... oh! Oh! Oh!

795
00:54:47,183 --> 00:54:49,985
Why don't you hang out
for a while?

796
00:54:49,987 --> 00:54:51,186
We're having
a little gathering

797
00:54:51,188 --> 00:54:52,821
at the house
after we finish up.

798
00:54:55,892 --> 00:54:58,360
And what about
the sokurovs?

799
00:54:58,362 --> 00:55:01,964
What about them?
They're a whole family
of assholes.

800
00:55:01,966 --> 00:55:05,034
But assholes from guerneville,
not assholes from kandahar.

801
00:55:07,772 --> 00:55:10,239
Yeah,
you got to relax, osman.

802
00:55:10,241 --> 00:55:12,675
Come on.
It'll be good for you.

803
00:55:12,677 --> 00:55:13,909
So, you think I'm crazy?

804
00:55:13,911 --> 00:55:15,411
Yes, I do.
Okay.

805
00:55:26,189 --> 00:55:27,556
<i> Osman.</i>

806
00:55:27,558 --> 00:55:30,125
Gloria, how are you?

807
00:55:30,127 --> 00:55:31,327
You all right?

808
00:55:31,329 --> 00:55:32,528
<i> Yes, I'm fine.</i>

809
00:55:32,530 --> 00:55:34,396
<i> I'm just checking in.</i>

810
00:55:34,398 --> 00:55:36,332
Why are you whispering?

811
00:55:36,334 --> 00:55:39,401
They are doing something.

812
00:55:40,036 --> 00:55:42,037
Okay.

813
00:55:42,039 --> 00:55:46,542
Yeah. I just wanted to see
if you've been over
to Lindsay's.

814
00:55:46,544 --> 00:55:49,278
<i> Yeah, yeah,</i>
<i> everything's fine.</i>

815
00:55:49,280 --> 00:55:50,746
You see Lindsay?

816
00:55:50,748 --> 00:55:53,182
<i> No, not yet, but we will.</i>

817
00:55:53,184 --> 00:55:55,284
<i> Talked to maddie.</i>

818
00:55:55,286 --> 00:55:58,253
Okay, I just
want to make sure...

819
00:55:58,255 --> 00:56:01,590
Osman, I'm telling you,
everything is fine.

820
00:56:01,592 --> 00:56:03,125
There's nothing
to worry about,

821
00:56:03,960 --> 00:56:05,094
all right?

822
00:56:09,666 --> 00:56:10,999
Osman?

823
00:56:12,235 --> 00:56:13,669
Okay, thank you.

824
00:56:13,671 --> 00:56:14,837
Thank you very much.

825
00:56:31,888 --> 00:56:33,555
Watch this.

826
00:56:33,557 --> 00:56:34,623
Feel it.

827
00:56:35,892 --> 00:56:37,760
Sense the roots
under your feet.

828
00:56:45,969 --> 00:56:47,436
And now.

829
00:56:51,708 --> 00:56:54,309
Whoa.

830
00:57:31,080 --> 00:57:33,048
I want to feel your heart.

831
00:57:47,297 --> 00:57:49,164
You enjoying yourself?

832
00:57:50,500 --> 00:57:52,634
Everyone is very nice.

833
00:57:52,636 --> 00:57:55,637
The bearded man wanted
to touch my heart.

834
00:58:00,311 --> 00:58:03,111
But I don't know if
I'm in the mood for a party.

835
00:58:03,113 --> 00:58:05,714
Are you still worried
about Lindsay?

836
00:58:07,350 --> 00:58:08,617
Carl told me.

837
00:58:11,688 --> 00:58:13,222
I don't know.

838
00:58:14,157 --> 00:58:15,791
Maybe.

839
00:58:17,861 --> 00:58:19,795
Where is Carl, anyway?

840
00:58:24,501 --> 00:58:28,237
Man gets stoned
and has to exercise.

841
00:58:28,239 --> 00:58:31,306
No, honestly,
it's like you smoke
one joint at a concert

842
00:58:31,308 --> 00:58:33,809
and next thing you know
he's doing one-armed push-ups

843
00:58:33,811 --> 00:58:35,410
on the dance floor.

844
00:58:37,580 --> 00:58:39,581
It does not have
that same effect on me.

845
00:58:39,583 --> 00:58:41,683
Fuck no. He's mad.

846
00:58:45,722 --> 00:58:47,656
You're with Carl, right?

847
00:58:51,794 --> 00:58:53,462
Why do you ask?

848
00:58:55,298 --> 00:58:57,299
I was just...

849
00:58:57,301 --> 00:58:58,901
I didn't know if...

850
00:58:58,903 --> 00:59:00,869
We're in
an open relationship.

851
00:59:02,105 --> 00:59:06,675
We stay open to each other,
and open to the world.

852
00:59:08,678 --> 00:59:10,212
I see.

853
00:59:16,320 --> 00:59:17,686
What?

854
00:59:17,688 --> 00:59:19,388
- Nothing.
- What?

855
00:59:25,094 --> 00:59:27,262
Can I ask you something?

856
00:59:27,264 --> 00:59:28,630
Yeah.

857
00:59:30,233 --> 00:59:32,100
What was it like
over there?

858
00:59:34,771 --> 00:59:38,640
It's funny,
i spent my whole life
trying to leave,

859
00:59:38,642 --> 00:59:40,475
not because
i was always in danger

860
00:59:40,477 --> 00:59:41,810
like people here imagine,

861
00:59:41,812 --> 00:59:44,279
but because I got it
stuck in my head

862
00:59:44,281 --> 00:59:47,616
that life started
somewhere else.

863
00:59:47,618 --> 00:59:51,887
Like you had to get out
to have a chance
at really living.

864
00:59:51,889 --> 00:59:53,956
America, Europe,
wherever.

865
00:59:56,025 --> 00:59:59,461
Don't get me wrong.
The danger was real.

866
01:00:03,633 --> 01:00:05,300
I don't know.
Like...

867
01:00:07,003 --> 01:00:10,238
This one time,
i went to visit my aunt.

868
01:00:10,240 --> 01:00:12,507
She lived
in an apartment above

869
01:00:12,509 --> 01:00:15,544
the massoud monument
in Kabul.

870
01:00:15,546 --> 01:00:17,512
I knock on her door,
and boom.

871
01:00:18,781 --> 01:00:20,649
I run in,

872
01:00:20,651 --> 01:00:24,519
and she's on the balcony
doing her laundry.

873
01:00:25,855 --> 01:00:27,155
Only, her windows
are gone

874
01:00:27,157 --> 01:00:29,658
and she's got
two pieces of glass

875
01:00:29,660 --> 01:00:32,160
sticking out of her back
like wings.

876
01:00:32,162 --> 01:00:33,395
So, I run toward her.

877
01:00:33,397 --> 01:00:36,098
She's bleeding,
but strangely she seems okay.

878
01:00:36,100 --> 01:00:38,300
So, I look out and I see

879
01:00:38,302 --> 01:00:39,501
there's something
in the tree.

880
01:00:39,503 --> 01:00:42,070
We're three floors up,
so it's at eye level.

881
01:00:42,072 --> 01:00:44,573
And it's a foot and an
ankle still in the shoe.

882
01:00:44,575 --> 01:00:45,774
And down below,

883
01:00:45,776 --> 01:00:48,176
there's a Humvee
split in half,

884
01:00:48,178 --> 01:00:50,779
and there's
an American soldier
bent into the shape

885
01:00:50,781 --> 01:00:52,648
only dead people make.

886
01:00:53,383 --> 01:00:54,816
It's a woman.

887
01:00:54,818 --> 01:00:56,084
I can tell,
because her helmet's

888
01:00:56,086 --> 01:00:57,252
been blown off.

889
01:00:58,454 --> 01:01:01,056
And there's
a cigarette seller

890
01:01:01,058 --> 01:01:03,892
with his little pushcart,
and they're both on fire.

891
01:01:03,894 --> 01:01:06,228
And people are trying
to put him out,

892
01:01:06,230 --> 01:01:08,363
but he keeps running
and running.

893
01:01:08,365 --> 01:01:09,798
And there's bits of cars

894
01:01:09,800 --> 01:01:11,867
and people
in trees everywhere.

895
01:01:11,869 --> 01:01:13,802
So, I run down to help,

896
01:01:13,804 --> 01:01:16,938
throwing people in taxis
or whatever will take them.

897
01:01:16,940 --> 01:01:19,207
And I grab this one guy,

898
01:01:19,209 --> 01:01:21,476
and his leg
comes right off.

899
01:01:21,478 --> 01:01:23,845
Just separates
from his body.

900
01:01:27,417 --> 01:01:28,884
So, I toss it
in the car with him,

901
01:01:28,886 --> 01:01:31,219
and on to the next
and the next.

902
01:01:32,989 --> 01:01:36,958
And, uh,
when it was all over,

903
01:01:36,960 --> 01:01:40,128
I didn't feel
anything at all.

904
01:01:42,832 --> 01:01:48,203
Just the adrenaline
and heat.

905
01:02:06,823 --> 01:02:09,624
But it wasn't like that
all the time.

906
01:02:11,928 --> 01:02:13,795
It was regular life.

907
01:02:19,535 --> 01:02:21,970
You'd be surprised
what you get used to, yeah?

908
01:02:27,944 --> 01:02:29,678
Well, you're here now.

909
01:02:30,546 --> 01:02:32,380
Yeah.

910
01:02:32,382 --> 01:02:34,082
You're safe.

911
01:02:35,485 --> 01:02:37,753
I didn't come here
just to be safe.

912
01:02:41,057 --> 01:02:42,557
Good.

913
01:02:43,860 --> 01:02:45,327
Yeah.

914
01:03:27,337 --> 01:03:29,871
They can hear you
in the next county!

915
01:03:30,940 --> 01:03:32,307
I like this song,

916
01:03:32,309 --> 01:03:35,777
but for me the song
by the American

917
01:03:35,779 --> 01:03:39,447
with the voice like rocks,
that is the best song.

918
01:03:40,416 --> 01:03:42,450
What is it called?
No idea.

919
01:03:42,452 --> 01:03:44,119
Oh, yes, yes.

920
01:03:59,369 --> 01:04:01,269
Hey, osman,
i was thinking

921
01:04:01,271 --> 01:04:03,438
about the conversation
we had this afternoon.

922
01:04:03,440 --> 01:04:04,973
Lindsay and the sokurovs
and all that.

923
01:04:04,975 --> 01:04:06,875
Oh, god, Dmitri sokurov.

924
01:04:06,877 --> 01:04:08,210
My friend,
now is not the time

925
01:04:08,212 --> 01:04:09,444
to talk about these things.

926
01:04:09,446 --> 01:04:11,580
Now is the time
only for dancing!

927
01:04:11,582 --> 01:04:13,849
I lived
on the sokurov property

928
01:04:13,851 --> 01:04:18,253
for, like,
four months in this killer
converted chicken Coop.

929
01:04:18,255 --> 01:04:21,556
But the kids, man,
they'd spy on me masturbating.

930
01:04:21,558 --> 01:04:22,691
It was freaky.

931
01:04:22,693 --> 01:04:24,292
But seriously,

932
01:04:24,294 --> 01:04:25,760
I was swimming laps
and I couldn't stop

933
01:04:25,762 --> 01:04:28,196
thinking about it.

934
01:04:28,198 --> 01:04:29,564
I mean,
he comes all this way,

935
01:04:29,566 --> 01:04:33,101
and ends up trailing Lindsay
around west county.

936
01:04:33,103 --> 01:04:34,536
I mean, what's up with that,
right?

937
01:04:34,538 --> 01:04:35,904
I had to get out of there.

938
01:04:35,906 --> 01:04:39,107
Their teenager threatened
to light my junk on fire.

939
01:04:39,109 --> 01:04:42,310
And then I realized,
he's a journalist.

940
01:04:42,312 --> 01:04:43,979
That's what they do.

941
01:04:44,714 --> 01:04:46,014
Yeah.

942
01:04:46,016 --> 01:04:47,515
I think you're great, osman,

943
01:04:47,517 --> 01:04:50,018
but it's a dark profession,
isn't it?

944
01:04:50,020 --> 01:04:51,453
I mean, at its core?
Carl...

945
01:04:51,455 --> 01:04:53,455
No, no, it's fine.

946
01:04:53,457 --> 01:04:56,024
Um... yeah.

947
01:04:56,893 --> 01:05:00,829
Yeah, there are some
problem things

948
01:05:00,831 --> 01:05:02,130
about it sometimes.

949
01:05:02,132 --> 01:05:04,799
Yes, problem things.

950
01:05:04,801 --> 01:05:06,067
Like what?
Hey, Carl, come on.

951
01:05:06,069 --> 01:05:07,469
Now you're just being
an asshole.

952
01:05:07,471 --> 01:05:12,040
Well, sometimes
the journalist gets it wrong.

953
01:05:12,842 --> 01:05:15,210
Or lies.

954
01:05:15,212 --> 01:05:18,146
Or sometimes he doesn't care
about the people.

955
01:05:18,148 --> 01:05:20,682
Only the story.
Exactly.

956
01:05:20,684 --> 01:05:23,885
They go somewhere,
find a person who embodies

957
01:05:23,887 --> 01:05:27,155
what they already think
about a place,

958
01:05:28,491 --> 01:05:30,725
then milk them for drama.

959
01:05:30,727 --> 01:05:32,861
Leave the dead, empty skin
by the side of the road

960
01:05:32,863 --> 01:05:34,129
and on to the next.

961
01:05:34,797 --> 01:05:37,165
I think Sandra is right.

962
01:05:37,167 --> 01:05:39,467
Now you are being
the asshole.

963
01:05:39,469 --> 01:05:42,437
It's true!
I am an asshole!

964
01:05:43,840 --> 01:05:47,042
A great big,
fleshy asshole.

965
01:05:48,477 --> 01:05:51,012
I'm just kidding, osman.
I'm trying to make a point.

966
01:05:51,014 --> 01:05:52,547
Don't listen to him, osman.

967
01:05:52,549 --> 01:05:54,316
He's just jealous
because he never got to prove

968
01:05:54,318 --> 01:05:56,217
his manhood in the shit.

969
01:06:00,056 --> 01:06:02,257
Here, let me show you
how to use that.

970
01:06:14,704 --> 01:06:16,438
If we listen
to one another,

971
01:06:18,407 --> 01:06:21,242
if we read each other's
intentions clearly,

972
01:06:21,244 --> 01:06:23,111
then no one
will come to harm.

973
01:06:24,915 --> 01:06:26,681
I...
Shh! No talking.

974
01:06:26,683 --> 01:06:28,650
Just listen and react.

975
01:06:31,253 --> 01:06:33,521
Carl!
What? What is it, baby?

976
01:06:33,523 --> 01:06:35,090
All right, you guys,
let's bring it in.

977
01:06:35,092 --> 01:06:36,791
Seriously, osman,
it's not worth it.

978
01:06:36,793 --> 01:06:39,227
Both of you, chill.
They're so
worried about you.

979
01:06:39,229 --> 01:06:40,462
Carl, let's sleep it off.

980
01:06:40,464 --> 01:06:42,263
I said quiet!

981
01:06:42,265 --> 01:06:43,732
Oh, my god!

982
01:06:44,600 --> 01:06:46,301
Carl...

983
01:06:46,303 --> 01:06:47,969
Carl, you okay, man?

984
01:06:51,975 --> 01:06:54,209
He's fine. Come on.

985
01:06:56,379 --> 01:06:57,912
You deserved it.

986
01:07:01,917 --> 01:07:03,351
Is he all right?

987
01:07:03,353 --> 01:07:05,220
Couldn't be happier.

988
01:07:06,889 --> 01:07:09,958
Um, hey, do you mind
staying here tonight?

989
01:07:09,960 --> 01:07:11,926
It's a little late
to drive you home.

990
01:07:11,928 --> 01:07:13,561
Yes, thank you.

991
01:07:18,968 --> 01:07:20,368
You okay?

992
01:07:22,071 --> 01:07:23,805
I want to know you all.

993
01:07:24,340 --> 01:07:25,607
Know this place.

994
01:07:25,609 --> 01:07:27,308
But I'm doing it wrong.
I can tell.

995
01:07:28,377 --> 01:07:30,378
There's no right way
or wrong way.

996
01:07:30,913 --> 01:07:33,815
Just be here.

997
01:07:35,918 --> 01:07:39,454
I left too many people behind
to just be here.

998
01:07:41,424 --> 01:07:43,191
It has to mean
something.

999
01:07:44,293 --> 01:07:45,393
Osman, I...

1000
01:07:45,395 --> 01:07:46,694
It's okay.

1001
01:07:54,403 --> 01:07:56,971
You have to know a place
to live in it.

1002
01:07:59,008 --> 01:08:01,910
You have to dig in,
find the center.

1003
01:08:05,481 --> 01:08:07,282
How can I live here
if I can't see

1004
01:08:07,284 --> 01:08:08,950
the bottom of things?

1005
01:08:10,352 --> 01:08:12,887
Maybe that's not
your job anymore.

1006
01:08:16,092 --> 01:08:17,892
Then what's my job?

1007
01:08:21,964 --> 01:08:23,932
I don't know.

1008
01:08:32,341 --> 01:08:33,775
Not now.

1009
01:09:27,830 --> 01:09:29,397
Lindsay.

1010
01:09:37,907 --> 01:09:39,774
I got it. Uh-huh.

1011
01:09:40,943 --> 01:09:42,277
Uh-huh.

1012
01:09:42,811 --> 01:09:43,878
Gloria.

1013
01:09:43,880 --> 01:09:45,413
Not now.

1014
01:09:46,248 --> 01:09:48,082
Wait, I'm coming with you.

1015
01:09:51,954 --> 01:09:54,322
Just stay here,
and I'll be back
as soon as I can.

1016
01:09:54,324 --> 01:09:55,690
What is it?
What is happening?

1017
01:09:55,692 --> 01:09:57,692
Nothing, just stay here.

1018
01:09:57,694 --> 01:10:00,595
Gloria, I promised...
Stay here!

1019
01:10:09,872 --> 01:10:11,773
<i> Police blotter.</i>

1020
01:10:11,775 --> 01:10:14,475
<i> Notes for September 12th.</i>

1021
01:10:14,477 --> 01:10:16,744
<i> The hot tub man</i>
<i> is in danger,</i>

1022
01:10:16,746 --> 01:10:20,014
<i> but I can help him</i>
<i> before he comes to harm.</i>

1023
01:10:20,016 --> 01:10:21,416
<i> I am certain of this,</i>

1024
01:10:21,418 --> 01:10:23,918
<i> even if I am certain</i>
<i> of nothing else.</i>

1025
01:10:25,354 --> 01:10:28,122
<i> Sometimes you can see</i>
<i> inside the hole,</i>

1026
01:10:29,258 --> 01:10:31,125
<i> and sometimes you can't.</i>

1027
01:11:04,893 --> 01:11:06,794
I know what you did.

1028
01:11:06,796 --> 01:11:09,197
Wait. No.

1029
01:11:09,798 --> 01:11:11,299
No, wait!

1030
01:14:06,241 --> 01:14:09,210
Gloria, I...
I have to tell you...

1031
01:14:09,212 --> 01:14:10,578
We found his truck.

1032
01:14:12,448 --> 01:14:14,615
Underwater.

1033
01:14:14,617 --> 01:14:17,618
Somebody dumped it
in the old reservoir.

1034
01:14:18,220 --> 01:14:19,287
Is he...

1035
01:14:19,289 --> 01:14:20,688
Osman.

1036
01:14:21,857 --> 01:14:24,859
Whatever you know,
you have to tell me.

1037
01:14:44,213 --> 01:14:45,713
That his?

1038
01:14:57,793 --> 01:14:59,760
You went pretty far in.

1039
01:15:00,729 --> 01:15:02,396
He was chasing me.

1040
01:15:02,398 --> 01:15:04,932
It was self-defense, osman.

1041
01:15:04,934 --> 01:15:07,034
Whatever you did,
it's all right.

1042
01:15:28,156 --> 01:15:29,957
It was right here.

1043
01:15:52,247 --> 01:15:54,749
You okay?

1044
01:15:54,751 --> 01:15:57,552
Part of me wishes
we would have found him there.

1045
01:15:58,320 --> 01:16:00,221
In the ground.

1046
01:16:00,223 --> 01:16:04,158
Christ, that's not what
you tell the cops.

1047
01:16:04,160 --> 01:16:05,560
Come with me
back to the station.

1048
01:16:05,562 --> 01:16:07,161
You stay out of sight.

1049
01:16:07,163 --> 01:16:09,330
I'll send the boys out
to track down Gary,

1050
01:16:09,332 --> 01:16:10,998
drag him in for assault.

1051
01:16:13,001 --> 01:16:15,870
Meanwhile, I'm back out
to the reservoir.

1052
01:16:20,309 --> 01:16:23,544
But look, not finding Gary
out there

1053
01:16:23,546 --> 01:16:25,346
is a good thing, okay?

1054
01:16:28,450 --> 01:16:31,218
You said they didn't find
his body in the truck, right?

1055
01:16:31,220 --> 01:16:32,887
Who?
Lindsay.

1056
01:16:32,889 --> 01:16:34,288
No, no body.

1057
01:16:34,290 --> 01:16:36,691
There are traces of blood
all over the thing.

1058
01:16:36,693 --> 01:16:38,225
Some on the steering wheel,

1059
01:16:38,227 --> 01:16:40,795
some on the grill,
on the door.

1060
01:16:40,797 --> 01:16:42,063
Stop the car.

1061
01:16:42,065 --> 01:16:43,164
What?

1062
01:16:43,166 --> 01:16:46,067
Please stop the car. Stop.

1063
01:16:46,668 --> 01:16:48,069
Where are you going?

1064
01:16:48,071 --> 01:16:50,171
I need to walk.
Where?

1065
01:16:53,008 --> 01:16:55,309
I... I'll call you
if I need you!

1066
01:18:08,216 --> 01:18:10,251
Any word on Gary yet?

1067
01:18:10,253 --> 01:18:12,987
Nope.

1068
01:18:12,989 --> 01:18:16,190
Martin says they finished
the work on the truck, though.

1069
01:18:16,192 --> 01:18:18,025
Says it's all from
the same guy.

1070
01:18:19,127 --> 01:18:20,428
What is?

1071
01:18:20,430 --> 01:18:21,796
The blood.

1072
01:18:21,798 --> 01:18:23,164
From the truck?

1073
01:18:23,665 --> 01:18:24,732
Inside and out.

1074
01:18:24,734 --> 01:18:27,201
Your rock?
It's all the same.
Same guy.

1075
01:18:28,370 --> 01:18:29,937
Lindsay?

1076
01:18:29,939 --> 01:18:31,439
The other one. The...

1077
01:18:31,441 --> 01:18:32,840
The dude
in the ditch.

1078
01:18:34,242 --> 01:18:35,342
What was his name?

1079
01:18:36,344 --> 01:18:37,511
Beaux.

1080
01:18:38,113 --> 01:18:39,380
That's it.

1081
01:18:56,065 --> 01:18:57,665
Uh, you want to come in?

1082
01:18:59,401 --> 01:19:01,268
Where's Lindsay?

1083
01:19:01,270 --> 01:19:02,470
What do you mean?

1084
01:19:02,472 --> 01:19:04,605
The day he disappeared,
no one come for him.

1085
01:19:05,407 --> 01:19:06,841
I think he left on his own.

1086
01:19:08,210 --> 01:19:09,910
You should go now.
No!

1087
01:19:12,013 --> 01:19:13,981
Where is Lindsay?

1088
01:19:13,983 --> 01:19:15,683
I don't know.

1089
01:19:15,685 --> 01:19:19,286
He hurt that man, didn't he?
But no one come for him, huh?

1090
01:19:19,288 --> 01:19:20,921
I don't know
what you're talking about!

1091
01:19:20,923 --> 01:19:22,156
Where is Lindsay?

1092
01:19:22,158 --> 01:19:24,225
He's under the sea,
isn't he?

1093
01:19:24,227 --> 01:19:25,326
Maddie.

1094
01:19:25,328 --> 01:19:27,261
They told me
that's where he lives now.

1095
01:19:32,367 --> 01:19:35,302
Who? Who tell you that?

1096
01:19:35,304 --> 01:19:37,471
I don't know.
The police.

1097
01:19:37,473 --> 01:19:40,141
Dmitri. Everybody.

1098
01:19:40,143 --> 01:19:42,076
Can I help you,<i> mi amigo?</i>

1099
01:19:51,853 --> 01:19:54,221
You tell Lindsay
I'm looking for him.

1100
01:19:55,891 --> 01:19:57,658
You tell him
i know what he did.

1101
01:20:10,505 --> 01:20:12,072
Hey, man.

1102
01:20:12,074 --> 01:20:14,175
You know the hot tub man,
Lindsay, yes?

1103
01:20:14,177 --> 01:20:16,177
<i> Yeah, yeah, we used to go</i>
<i> to high school together.</i>

1104
01:20:16,179 --> 01:20:17,378
He was being hunted.

1105
01:20:17,380 --> 01:20:19,146
They found
his truck underwater.

1106
01:20:19,148 --> 01:20:21,615
<i> Wait, what?</i>
He owed the sokurovs money.

1107
01:20:21,617 --> 01:20:23,884
I think it's
for his business.
I don't know.

1108
01:20:23,886 --> 01:20:26,053
But he was in trouble
and now he's gone.

1109
01:20:26,055 --> 01:20:28,989
<i> They were chasing him,</i>
<i> but now the man is dead.</i>

1110
01:20:35,063 --> 01:20:37,298
What? What is it?
<i> If he hurt someone,</i>

1111
01:20:37,300 --> 01:20:39,200
<i> there had to be a reason,</i>
<i> right?</i>

1112
01:20:39,202 --> 01:20:40,634
<i> There had to be</i>
<i> a reason.</i>

1113
01:20:40,636 --> 01:20:43,070
<i> Hell, I don't know.</i>
<i> He's a wild man.</i>

1114
01:20:43,072 --> 01:20:45,372
<i> A little bit like you and me,</i>
<i> I guess.</i>

1115
01:20:45,374 --> 01:20:46,574
How do you mean?

1116
01:20:46,576 --> 01:20:49,910
Well, on one hand
he's got a sense of humor,

1117
01:20:49,912 --> 01:20:51,111
on the other
he's got a little bit

1118
01:20:51,113 --> 01:20:52,913
of a death wish thing
happening, you know?

1119
01:20:52,915 --> 01:20:55,749
If I had that wish anymore
you think I'd be here?

1120
01:20:57,485 --> 01:20:59,587
What about the soku...

1121
01:20:59,589 --> 01:21:00,788
<i> Wait.</i>

1122
01:21:02,290 --> 01:21:03,824
I got to go.

1123
01:21:06,428 --> 01:21:08,095
Shit.

1124
01:21:12,801 --> 01:21:14,101
Hey.

1125
01:21:14,103 --> 01:21:16,103
Hey, kid.

1126
01:21:16,105 --> 01:21:18,606
No, no, no!
I just want to talk!

1127
01:21:18,608 --> 01:21:19,840
Please stop.

1128
01:21:23,912 --> 01:21:25,212
Oh, shit.

1129
01:21:57,412 --> 01:22:00,681
Let go of me!
My dad's going to kill you!

1130
01:22:47,696 --> 01:22:49,430
You come to pay
your respects?

1131
01:22:51,634 --> 01:22:54,234
It's an honor to be invited,
don't you think?

1132
01:23:34,409 --> 01:23:36,243
Sorry, I...

1133
01:23:37,545 --> 01:23:39,046
Get off the property.

1134
01:23:39,481 --> 01:23:40,647
Dmitri.

1135
01:23:41,916 --> 01:23:43,851
You should see your face.

1136
01:23:43,853 --> 01:23:45,386
Dmitri sokurov?

1137
01:23:47,188 --> 01:23:49,990
Yes, sir.
What can I do for you?

1138
01:23:49,992 --> 01:23:53,460
You the Afghan pushed
the little guy off his bike?

1139
01:23:53,462 --> 01:23:55,429
That's my sole heir, sir.

1140
01:23:56,364 --> 01:23:57,798
So far, anyways.

1141
01:24:01,136 --> 01:24:02,870
What the hell?

1142
01:24:02,872 --> 01:24:04,138
I need to talk to you.

1143
01:24:04,140 --> 01:24:05,506
Well, that's great.
I need to talk to you, too.

1144
01:24:05,508 --> 01:24:07,908
Don't go cross-checking
my kid into ditches.

1145
01:24:10,046 --> 01:24:12,913
Let's go talk about this
somewhere privately, huh?

1146
01:24:12,915 --> 01:24:16,050
These people don't need
to hear our petty shit.

1147
01:24:16,052 --> 01:24:18,018
- Hey.
- Oh, stop it.

1148
01:24:18,020 --> 01:24:20,821
Why the hell is everybody
so serious?

1149
01:24:22,023 --> 01:24:23,490
Come on.

1150
01:24:24,359 --> 01:24:25,426
Come on.

1151
01:24:29,164 --> 01:24:32,966
Money? That's what
you want, yeah?

1152
01:24:32,968 --> 01:24:35,402
- What's happening here?
- Oh, that's Ingrid.

1153
01:24:35,404 --> 01:24:37,171
Sister-in-law.

1154
01:24:37,173 --> 01:24:38,806
Why don't you
say hello to...

1155
01:24:38,808 --> 01:24:41,742
Sorry, what is it?
From Afghanistan.

1156
01:24:41,744 --> 01:24:43,243
Can you beat it?

1157
01:24:43,245 --> 01:24:45,112
My uncle fought
over there.

1158
01:24:45,114 --> 01:24:47,214
Called it a war
for a piece of shit.

1159
01:24:49,118 --> 01:24:50,918
He didn't feel like
he could speak his mind

1160
01:24:50,920 --> 01:24:53,287
for most of his life,
but let me tell you,

1161
01:24:53,289 --> 01:24:56,056
when he finally did,
it was like the dam broke.

1162
01:24:56,058 --> 01:24:57,224
Where is Lindsay?

1163
01:24:57,226 --> 01:24:59,693
I'm going to give you
100 just to be safe.

1164
01:24:59,695 --> 01:25:01,328
I haven't bought
a mailbox in years,

1165
01:25:01,330 --> 01:25:03,363
so what do I know?
Do you hear me?

1166
01:25:05,100 --> 01:25:06,300
Did I hear you?

1167
01:25:06,302 --> 01:25:08,769
If he has debts,
i will help pay.

1168
01:25:08,771 --> 01:25:10,604
I have money
from back home,

1169
01:25:10,606 --> 01:25:12,272
money I make
as journalist, okay?

1170
01:25:12,274 --> 01:25:14,508
Yeah.
I don't want that.

1171
01:25:14,510 --> 01:25:16,477
Oh, come on, sir.

1172
01:25:16,479 --> 01:25:18,011
Typical immigrant, right?

1173
01:25:18,013 --> 01:25:19,613
All earnest fucking pride.

1174
01:25:19,615 --> 01:25:22,583
I want to go home.
Oh, shut up!

1175
01:25:22,585 --> 01:25:25,018
I can't... I can't deal
with you right now!

1176
01:25:25,020 --> 01:25:26,453
Don't talk to her
like that.

1177
01:25:27,889 --> 01:25:29,389
Is this your house?

1178
01:25:30,525 --> 01:25:32,526
Huh?

1179
01:25:32,528 --> 01:25:34,695
Do... do you know Ingrid?

1180
01:25:34,697 --> 01:25:37,264
Because if you
knew Ingrid...
I know Lindsay...

1181
01:25:37,266 --> 01:25:39,366
You know what?
You know what?
You know what?

1182
01:25:40,735 --> 01:25:44,271
See, Ingrid was in a fire
with my brother,

1183
01:25:44,273 --> 01:25:46,073
and ever since then
she's been a little bit...

1184
01:25:46,075 --> 01:25:47,674
But you can't condescend.

1185
01:25:51,012 --> 01:25:52,412
Let's go.

1186
01:25:52,414 --> 01:25:57,017
Go, go, go and see
what's going on
up there, huh?

1187
01:25:57,019 --> 01:26:00,187
I don't... I don't have
the stomach for it.

1188
01:26:00,189 --> 01:26:03,524
But that fucking midwife,
let me tell you, she's good.

1189
01:26:03,526 --> 01:26:06,126
I know that Lindsay...

1190
01:26:06,128 --> 01:26:08,395
He ran down
one of your men, yes?

1191
01:26:08,397 --> 01:26:09,696
Killed him?

1192
01:26:09,698 --> 01:26:11,532
Finished him off
with a rock, I think?

1193
01:26:11,534 --> 01:26:13,600
Maybe he meant
to do this thing,
maybe he didn't.

1194
01:26:13,602 --> 01:26:15,369
I don't know.
But he was afraid.

1195
01:26:15,371 --> 01:26:17,538
I see it in him,
believe me.

1196
01:26:17,540 --> 01:26:18,672
He was afraid
when he did it,

1197
01:26:18,674 --> 01:26:19,973
and he was afraid
when he ran.

1198
01:26:19,975 --> 01:26:21,775
I know this.

1199
01:26:21,777 --> 01:26:24,378
And when his truck
went in the water,
he wasn't in it.

1200
01:26:25,813 --> 01:26:27,147
So, where is he?

1201
01:26:28,183 --> 01:26:29,616
You tell me.

1202
01:26:31,219 --> 01:26:32,753
Why do you care?

1203
01:26:32,755 --> 01:26:34,955
I owe him.
He needs me.

1204
01:26:34,957 --> 01:26:36,657
Where is he?

1205
01:26:36,659 --> 01:26:38,358
I'm sorry.
Nobody fucking needs you.

1206
01:26:38,360 --> 01:26:39,426
Where is he?

1207
01:26:42,530 --> 01:26:44,932
Why should anybody
tell you anything?

1208
01:26:48,236 --> 01:26:49,403
Is he dead?

1209
01:26:50,004 --> 01:26:51,538
Dmitri!

1210
01:26:54,943 --> 01:26:56,109
Is he?

1211
01:26:56,111 --> 01:26:59,680
You need to calm down,
Afghanistan.

1212
01:27:00,848 --> 01:27:03,584
Everybody dies, right?

1213
01:27:04,152 --> 01:27:05,719
Everybody dies.

1214
01:27:16,531 --> 01:27:19,066
Oh, man.

1215
01:27:19,068 --> 01:27:21,835
You... you should see
your face.

1216
01:27:41,723 --> 01:27:43,523
Don't worry
about it, bro.

1217
01:29:06,341 --> 01:29:08,008
You're right
about most of it.

1218
01:29:09,377 --> 01:29:12,212
And Lindsay will have to pay
for what he did to beaux.

1219
01:29:13,915 --> 01:29:16,149
But you don't really know us,
do you?

1220
01:29:19,921 --> 01:29:21,855
We take care of our own.

1221
01:29:24,625 --> 01:29:27,327
And here, everything
is always forgiven.

1222
01:29:37,004 --> 01:29:39,373
Now would be a good time
for you to leave.

1223
01:29:51,352 --> 01:29:52,586
Lindsay.

1224
01:29:53,588 --> 01:29:56,757
Hey, foreign correspondent.

1225
01:29:56,759 --> 01:29:58,558
What are you
doing here, man?

1226
01:29:58,560 --> 01:29:59,893
Uh...

1227
01:30:02,263 --> 01:30:04,264
I had to go away
for a little while.

1228
01:30:06,167 --> 01:30:08,568
But, uh, Dmitri said
i could come back.

1229
01:30:09,937 --> 01:30:11,671
I came back.

1230
01:30:13,207 --> 01:30:15,575
Hey, it's all right,
you know?

1231
01:30:16,544 --> 01:30:18,678
Yeah, yeah,
it's going to be fine.

1232
01:30:18,680 --> 01:30:20,213
I just got to...

1233
01:30:20,215 --> 01:30:22,315
You know, I just got
to help him out a little bit.

1234
01:30:22,317 --> 01:30:26,019
But he said...
You know, he said

1235
01:30:26,021 --> 01:30:27,788
everything's
going to be fine.

1236
01:30:30,024 --> 01:30:31,558
Why?

1237
01:30:31,560 --> 01:30:32,793
What?

1238
01:30:32,795 --> 01:30:34,294
Why'd you do it?

1239
01:30:40,234 --> 01:30:41,468
Ah...

1240
01:30:43,371 --> 01:30:45,172
He was hassling me, man.

1241
01:30:46,174 --> 01:30:47,307
Okay?

1242
01:30:48,910 --> 01:30:51,511
And he wasn't
going to stop.

1243
01:30:51,513 --> 01:30:53,880
No one's going
to make him stop.

1244
01:30:54,916 --> 01:30:57,984
And he deserved it, right?

1245
01:31:01,322 --> 01:31:02,589
He deserved it.

1246
01:31:04,258 --> 01:31:05,959
You know that.

1247
01:31:05,961 --> 01:31:08,295
Hey, hey, hey.

1248
01:31:11,232 --> 01:31:13,433
You ain't going
to tell anyone, right?

1249
01:31:13,435 --> 01:31:14,768
Huh?

1250
01:31:14,770 --> 01:31:16,136
You won't tell anybody.

1251
01:31:18,506 --> 01:31:19,906
You can't tell.

1252
01:31:29,951 --> 01:31:32,552
So beautiful, huh?

1253
01:31:34,222 --> 01:31:35,822
Little baby.

1254
01:33:40,548 --> 01:33:42,248
Didn't wake you, did I?

1255
01:33:44,986 --> 01:33:47,020
Lindsay's back
in town.

1256
01:33:48,589 --> 01:33:51,591
He killed that man.
Yeah.

1257
01:33:51,593 --> 01:33:54,294
Knowing it doesn't help,
does it?

1258
01:33:54,296 --> 01:33:56,062
They're on their way now
to lock him up.

1259
01:33:56,697 --> 01:33:58,665
Goddamn fool.

1260
01:34:12,446 --> 01:34:14,114
There's nothing.

1261
01:34:23,424 --> 01:34:25,458
<i> It's called</i>
<i> a time capsule.</i>

1262
01:34:27,495 --> 01:34:29,262
He made it in school
when he was...

1263
01:34:30,064 --> 01:34:33,833
I don't know, 11?

1264
01:34:40,441 --> 01:34:42,175
We're out of coffee.

1265
01:34:46,714 --> 01:34:48,548
Finally got ahold of him
last night.

1266
01:34:50,818 --> 01:34:53,887
He just got back to Kabul
from who knows where.

1267
01:34:55,089 --> 01:34:57,223
Oh, I get so excited.

1268
01:34:58,726 --> 01:35:01,828
I think talking to him's
going to make me feel better.

1269
01:35:06,967 --> 01:35:08,368
I could have sworn
i remembered

1270
01:35:08,370 --> 01:35:09,969
exactly where it was.

1271
01:35:17,712 --> 01:35:20,814
I wanted to find what he used
to think was worth saving.

1272
01:35:34,128 --> 01:35:37,130
I guess we both made a meal
of things last night, yeah?

1273
01:35:41,102 --> 01:35:43,069
Isn't very good, is it?

1274
01:36:08,262 --> 01:36:10,163
I love this song.

1275
01:36:12,867 --> 01:36:14,134
Come here.

1276
01:36:15,236 --> 01:36:16,302
Come.

1277
01:36:16,304 --> 01:36:17,570
Oh, no, no, no, no.

1278
01:36:17,572 --> 01:36:19,139
Gloria, please.

1279
01:36:19,141 --> 01:36:20,740
Gloria, please.

1280
01:36:24,812 --> 01:36:26,045
Gloria.

1281
01:36:26,914 --> 01:36:29,883
Feel your feet
on the ground, hmm?

1282
01:36:32,319 --> 01:36:33,419
Shh.

1283
01:37:39,053 --> 01:37:40,553
Gloria.

1284
01:38:04,845 --> 01:38:06,112
<i> Gabe.</i>

1285
01:38:06,114 --> 01:38:07,947
<i> Osman.</i>

1286
01:38:07,949 --> 01:38:09,515
<i> I didn't think</i>
<i> you'd be up, man.</i>

1287
01:38:09,517 --> 01:38:11,818
Couldn't sleep,
so I went for a walk.

1288
01:38:12,853 --> 01:38:14,687
<i> Where are you?</i>

1289
01:38:14,689 --> 01:38:15,855
<i> Kuru village.</i>

1290
01:38:15,857 --> 01:38:19,225
<i> Up at that spot</i>
<i> you showed me.</i>

1291
01:38:19,227 --> 01:38:21,895
Not sure I'll ever
make it down, though.

1292
01:38:26,533 --> 01:38:27,934
Come on in, you guys!

1293
01:38:27,936 --> 01:38:29,235
Water's great!

1294
01:38:29,737 --> 01:38:31,170
Never again!

1295
01:38:33,909 --> 01:38:35,742
<i> Gabe.</i>
Yeah?

1296
01:38:36,777 --> 01:38:38,845
I wish I was there
with you, man.

1297
01:38:41,148 --> 01:38:42,749
Just for a second.

1298
01:38:55,362 --> 01:38:57,063
<i> Can you hear it?</i>

1299
01:39:17,918 --> 01:39:19,752
<i> I can hear it.</i>
