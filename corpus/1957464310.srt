00:15:52,464 --> 00:15:53,928
That cowboy never had a chance.

193
00:15:53,930 --> 00:15:55,938
That cowboy was drunk.

194
00:15:55,940 --> 00:15:57,878
Don't matter how drunk he was,

195
00:15:57,880 --> 00:16:00,358
wouldn't made a difference anyhow.

She's fast as lightening.

197
00:16:02,770 --> 00:16:04,228
She's a killer.

198
00:16:04,230 --> 00:16:06,345

00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:17,063
I'm looking for a Victoria.

201
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:19,713
I'll see.

202
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:31,963
I hear you might be
looking for a new girl.

203

Take a seat.

So you've done this before?

Yep.

aren't you just the opportunist.

Becky's body's not even cold yet.

212

She's not even buried.

She's still very upset
about what happened.

Okay.

Just don't shoot the customers.

226
00:17:52,990 --> 00:17:53,823
Deal.

Did you lose something?

Stop it.

Yeah.

That boy's the biggest
disappointment in my life.

tell her this is the spur she gave you.

anybody sees you without...

told me not to say nothing.

Why not?

335
00:25:15,983 --> 00:25:17,263
Because I just can't print it.

336
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:19,313
But it's the truth.

a damn about a dead whore,

00:26:56,793 --> 00:26:58,338
Okay.

382
00:26:58,340 --> 00:26:59,603
Let's see maybe,

383
00:27:00,835 --> 00:27:03,518
is it okay if,

384
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:05,353
if we just talk.

385
00:27:06,270 --> 00:27:08,428
Good, good, good, good, okay.

386
00:27:08,430 --> 00:27:09,523
I've never,

387
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:14,878
I've never been to a whore house.

388
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:17,078
No, that's not good either.

389
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:18,828
I've never been to.

390
00:27:18,830 --> 00:27:20,168
I've never been here, right.

391
00:27:20,170 --> 00:27:21,948
I've never been here

392
00:27:21,950 --> 00:27:24,823
to Victoria's and it's because I,

393
00:27:27,390 --> 00:27:28,228
I don't,

394
00:27:28,230 --> 00:27:31,138
I don't believe in,

395
00:27:31,140 --> 00:27:32,318
oh, this is awful.

396
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:33,638
This is awful.

397
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:34,740
What am I going to do?

398
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:37,423
[Regina] Stop.

399
00:27:38,550 --> 00:27:39,398
Get off of me.

400
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:41,100
- No, get off of me.
- Calm down.

401
00:27:41,102 --> 00:27:43,282
[Cora] No, you took him from me.

402
00:27:43,284 --> 00:27:45,118
[Regina] I did not take him.

403
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:46,684
[Cora] You did.

404
00:27:46,686 --> 00:27:48,268
[Regina] He chose me.

405
00:27:48,270 --> 00:27:49,265
No.

406
00:27:49,267 --> 00:27:50,098
No, stop.

407
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:50,931
You're being so immature.

408
00:27:50,933 --> 00:27:51,764
No, I'm not.

409
00:27:51,766 --> 00:27:53,018
Stop it.

410
00:27:53,020 --> 00:27:53,928
Stop.

411
00:27:53,930 --> 00:27:55,908
What's going on here?

412
00:27:55,910 --> 00:27:57,363
Get off of her.

413
00:28:00,553 --> 00:28:01,553
Where are you going?

414
00:28:02,430 --> 00:28:03,263
Get back here.

415
00:28:05,740 --> 00:28:07,058
I was just defending myself.

416
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:08,238
Yeah, well you've been starting trouble

417
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:09,473
since you got here.

418
00:28:11,260 --> 00:28:12,750
This is my place

419
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:15,538
and my girls

420
00:28:15,540 --> 00:28:16,373
don't fight.

421
00:28:19,070 --> 00:28:21,718
You can both leave if you don't get that.

422
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:23,053
Do you understand me?

423
00:28:27,747 --> 00:28:28,908
Yeah.

424
00:28:28,910 --> 00:28:29,743
Can I go now?

425
00:28:32,010 --> 00:28:32,843
Yeah.

426
00:28:40,820 --> 00:28:41,653
Come on.

427
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:44,493
Give her a chance.

428
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:48,008
She didn't kill Becky.

429
00:28:48,010 --> 00:28:50,928
Yeah, well she's been
stealing my customers.

430
00:28:50,930 --> 00:28:52,788
Come on, Cora.

431
00:28:52,790 --> 00:28:54,992
It was exactly the same thing

432
00:28:54,994 --> 00:28:56,344
when you were the new girl.

433
00:28:59,140 --> 00:29:01,688
I wanted to just slap you so bad.

434
00:29:01,690 --> 00:29:02,523
Really?

435
00:29:03,940 --> 00:29:05,248
I didn't dare.

436
00:29:05,250 --> 00:29:06,250
You're too strong.

437
00:29:10,470 --> 00:29:12,198
Why, Johnny Brown.

438
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:13,578
What can we do for you?

439
00:29:13,580 --> 00:29:14,743
Is this a bad time?

440
00:29:16,610 --> 00:29:18,283
[Virginia] No, it's fine.

441
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:20,803
I'm here to see Regina.

442
00:29:22,610 --> 00:29:24,158
[Virginia] She's in her room.

443
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:25,233
Just give it a knock.

444
00:29:39,693 --> 00:29:41,573
Is it all right if we just talk?

445
00:29:43,010 --> 00:29:43,843
Sure.

446
00:29:45,930 --> 00:29:46,763
Good.

447
00:29:49,270 --> 00:29:52,068
I've never been here to,

448
00:29:52,070 --> 00:29:53,253
to Victoria's.

449
00:29:54,754 --> 00:29:55,587
I,

450
00:29:56,695 --> 00:29:57,528
I don't

451
00:29:58,540 --> 00:29:59,883
believe in.

452
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:03,518
Oh, well I,

453
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:05,408
I just think that.

454
00:30:05,410 --> 00:30:07,653
I think I know what
you're trying to say.

455
00:30:10,540 --> 00:30:12,093
So if you don't approve,

456
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:14,090
why are you here?

457
00:30:17,220 --> 00:30:18,053
Well,

458
00:30:20,750 --> 00:30:23,333
not too many ladies, women,

459
00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:26,200
come into town and

460
00:30:27,460 --> 00:30:30,331
I'm not hankering on anyone in town

461
00:30:30,333 --> 00:30:32,213
and, ladies that is.

462
00:30:32,215 --> 00:30:34,578
[Regina] I understand.

463
00:30:34,580 --> 00:30:37,430
I always thought someone
would come into town who would

464
00:30:38,300 --> 00:30:39,790
catch my eye and then

465
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:44,633
I saw you walk over to my
place with your horse and.

466
00:30:46,570 --> 00:30:48,613
Ah, this ain't coming out right.

467
00:30:49,510 --> 00:30:50,968
I'm sorry.

468
00:30:50,970 --> 00:30:51,828
I better go.

469
00:30:51,830 --> 00:30:52,698
No.

470
00:30:52,700 --> 00:30:54,238
Sit.

471
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:55,073
Please.

472
00:30:59,290 --> 00:31:00,121
Well, I just need...

473
00:31:00,123 --> 00:31:01,698
I truly,

474
00:31:01,700 --> 00:31:03,393
I'm truly flattered.

475
00:31:05,340 --> 00:31:06,943
If I was looking for a man,

476
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,453
I might surely consider you.

477
00:31:10,990 --> 00:31:11,823
It's just that

478
00:31:14,780 --> 00:31:15,613
right now,

479
00:31:16,550 --> 00:31:17,488
looking to settle down

480
00:31:17,490 --> 00:31:19,933
is not what I'm searching for.

481
00:31:22,260 --> 00:31:23,763
Of course I,

482
00:31:25,250 --> 00:31:26,268
I understand.

483
00:31:26,270 --> 00:31:27,103
I'm,

484
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:28,953
I'm sorry.

485
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:31,313
I better go.

486
00:31:33,330 --> 00:31:35,828
Thank you for the flowers, Johnny Brown.

487
00:31:35,830 --> 00:31:36,830
They're real pretty.

488
00:31:38,510 --> 00:31:39,460
You're welcome.

489
00:31:54,010 --> 00:31:55,023
That was quick.

490
00:31:57,260 --> 00:31:58,093
Oh,

491
00:31:59,210 --> 00:32:01,088
he just came by to bring me flowers

492
00:32:01,090 --> 00:32:02,390
and tell me I was special.

493
00:32:04,067 --> 00:32:05,105
[chuckling]

494
00:32:05,107 --> 00:32:06,948
I see,

495
00:32:06,950 --> 00:32:08,333
a secret admirer.

496
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:11,950
So it would seem.

497
00:32:16,690 --> 00:32:17,956
Let's go find Beth.

498
00:32:17,958 --> 00:32:18,791
Okay.

499
00:32:24,056 --> 00:32:25,158
Oh.

500
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:25,991
You go.

501
00:32:25,993 --> 00:32:26,993
No, it's okay, you go.

502
00:32:28,860 --> 00:32:29,860
I'll take it then.

503
00:32:31,010 --> 00:32:32,403
So you girls done fighting?

504
00:32:33,770 --> 00:32:35,158
Yeah,

505
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:36,727
we're done with all that.

506
00:32:36,729 --> 00:32:37,562
Good.

507
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:40,693
Now we have to take care of each other.

508
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:43,093
We're a family.

509
00:32:45,700 --> 00:32:47,893
So you're saying
Regina's my step-sister?

510
00:32:48,947 --> 00:32:51,068
That's not what I'm saying.

511
00:32:51,070 --> 00:32:52,498
You know what I'm saying.

512
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:53,500
[Cora] Yeah, I do.

513
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:55,963
You're such a wise apple.

514
00:33:00,310 --> 00:33:01,773
Sorry I hit ya, sis.

515
00:33:06,750 --> 00:33:09,168
You know, they're all my girls.

516
00:33:09,170 --> 00:33:10,293
I take care of them.

517
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:13,723
They all need me in some way.

518
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:16,503
I can see that.

519
00:33:18,410 --> 00:33:19,703
But you,

520
00:33:20,767 --> 00:33:21,653
you're different.

521
00:33:24,580 --> 00:33:25,943
You don't need anybody.

522
00:33:28,970 --> 00:33:30,203
Why are you here?

523
00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:37,440
Do you always ask so many
questions of your girls?

524
00:33:40,050 --> 00:33:41,143
Not usually,

525
00:33:43,050 --> 00:33:44,243
but you're different.

526
00:33:45,380 --> 00:33:46,933
I mean I feel like,

527
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:49,433
I dunno what it is.

528
00:33:53,830 --> 00:33:54,680
Does it matter?

529
00:33:57,150 --> 00:33:57,983
Not really.

530
00:34:00,772 --> 00:34:01,605
And you?

531
00:34:03,930 --> 00:34:05,347
What do you want?

532
00:34:07,780 --> 00:34:08,853
I have everything.

533
00:34:09,830 --> 00:34:10,958
I mean, I have my daughter.

534
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:12,683
I have my girls,

535
00:34:13,650 --> 00:34:16,508
present company excluded, of course.

536
00:34:16,510 --> 00:34:17,342
Of course.

537
00:34:20,030 --> 00:34:20,862
But,

538
00:34:22,409 --> 00:34:23,382
this can't be it.

539
00:34:24,739 --> 00:34:26,092
I can't be all you want.

540
00:34:28,179 --> 00:34:29,112
It is for now.

541
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:32,008
I mean the future has a way

542
00:34:32,010 --> 00:34:33,793
of taking care of itself, you know?

543
00:34:36,230 --> 00:34:37,063
Anyway,

544
00:34:38,460 --> 00:34:40,112
I'm glad you're here.

545
00:34:55,580 --> 00:34:57,008
Hello, Victoria.

546
00:34:57,010 --> 00:34:57,843
Hello.

547
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:09,548
I'm sorry.

548
00:35:09,550 --> 00:35:12,118
I didn't mean to drive away any business.

549
00:35:12,120 --> 00:35:13,318
It's all right.

550
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:15,178
She never buys anything anyway,

551
00:35:15,180 --> 00:35:16,783
just looky loo.

552
00:35:16,785 --> 00:35:18,998
[laughs]

553
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,278
This is Regina.

554
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:21,111
[Ida] Hello.

555
00:35:21,113 --> 00:35:22,458
Pleasure.

556
00:35:22,460 --> 00:35:24,125
She only has one dress.

557
00:35:24,127 --> 00:35:28,126
Oh, well, you've come
to the right place.

558
00:35:28,128 --> 00:35:29,648
Let me get something.

559
00:35:29,650 --> 00:35:30,481
Let's see.

560
00:35:30,483 --> 00:35:33,898
I think this and well this,

561
00:35:33,900 --> 00:35:37,330
I think this will suit you just fine.

562
00:35:37,332 --> 00:35:38,582
Go in here and try it on.

563
00:35:40,900 --> 00:35:42,358
You're doing good?

564
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:43,482
Better.

565
00:35:43,484 --> 00:35:44,315
Good.

566
00:35:44,317 --> 00:35:46,738
If you need any more help you let me know.

567
00:35:46,740 --> 00:35:48,598
Oh no, no.

568
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:50,563
I'm going to pay you back every dollar.

569
00:35:51,410 --> 00:35:53,018
It was my pleasure.

570
00:35:53,020 --> 00:35:53,920
[Ida] Thank you.

571
00:35:55,150 --> 00:35:56,800
That's what neighbors have for.

572
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:00,623
Oh, here comes our girl now.

573
00:36:00,625 --> 00:36:01,731
Here she comes.

574
00:36:01,733 --> 00:36:04,150
[soft music]

575
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:09,560
You look good.

576
00:36:09,562 --> 00:36:11,979
[soft music]

577
00:36:21,460 --> 00:36:22,293
Yes?

578
00:36:24,790 --> 00:36:25,763
We'll take it.

579
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:29,633
Beautiful.

580
00:36:38,754 --> 00:36:39,868
What do we say we go to Victoria's

581
00:36:39,870 --> 00:36:41,998
for some billiards later tonight, huh?

582
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,053
I got a gal.

583
00:36:43,890 --> 00:36:45,390
I don't got time for all that.

584
00:36:46,450 --> 00:36:48,518
Pete, Victoria ain't gonna let you in.

585
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:49,353
Why not?

586
00:36:50,999 --> 00:36:52,138
Well, because you killed that whore.

587
00:36:52,140 --> 00:36:52,973
Hold on.

588
00:36:55,540 --> 00:36:56,390
What do you mean?

589
00:36:57,317 --> 00:36:59,218
Well, I don't mean nothing.

590
00:36:59,220 --> 00:37:00,168
I was just saying...

591
00:37:00,170 --> 00:37:01,120
What did you say?

592
00:37:02,390 --> 00:37:06,788
I was just saying on account
that killed that whore.

593
00:37:06,790 --> 00:37:08,133
I didn't kill no whore.

594
00:37:09,372 --> 00:37:11,188
All right, calm down now.

595
00:37:11,190 --> 00:37:12,418
Put that thing away.

596
00:37:12,420 --> 00:37:14,676
You ever say that again,
I'll shoot you dead.

597
00:37:14,678 --> 00:37:16,173
Okay, Pete, okay.

598
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:18,031
It's time you start

599
00:37:18,033 --> 00:37:20,258
showing a little bit more respect, Beau.

600
00:37:20,260 --> 00:37:21,708
You too.

601
00:37:21,710 --> 00:37:22,543
Sure, Pete.

602
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,088
I'll be running this outfit someday.

603
00:37:25,090 --> 00:37:27,158
My pa ain't gonna be around forever.

604
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:28,248
You got that?

605
00:37:28,250 --> 00:37:29,200
Yeah, Pete, yeah.

606
00:37:31,977 --> 00:37:34,708
How long you've been with me, Henry?

607
00:37:34,710 --> 00:37:36,760
I reckon it's been a long time, Colonel

608
00:37:42,450 --> 00:37:44,723
Now that is fine lemonade, isn't it?

609
00:37:45,711 --> 00:37:46,542
Yes sir.

610
00:37:46,544 --> 00:37:48,073
Reminds me of back home.

611
00:37:51,092 --> 00:37:52,342
You're a good man, Henry.

612
00:37:53,332 --> 00:37:55,241
You're assistance over the years

613
00:37:55,243 --> 00:37:56,803
have been much appreciated.

614
00:37:58,233 --> 00:37:59,423
Thank you, Colonel.

615
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:02,058
Been saving these.

616
00:38:02,060 --> 00:38:02,893
Cuban.

617
00:38:06,970 --> 00:38:08,968
I'm worried about him.

618
00:38:08,970 --> 00:38:10,123
I really am.

619
00:38:11,407 --> 00:38:14,807
There's unsightly business with a whore.

620
00:38:16,380 --> 00:38:17,767
It's just,

621
00:38:17,769 --> 00:38:20,263
it's distasteful.

622
00:38:22,628 --> 00:38:23,478
To say the least.

623
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:29,413
I don't know where I went wrong with him.

624
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:38,648
I don't think it's
anything you did, Colonel.

625
00:38:38,650 --> 00:38:39,680
Sometimes

626
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:42,458
apple falls from the tree

627
00:38:42,460 --> 00:38:44,003
and it just goes bad.

628
00:38:47,209 --> 00:38:50,738
I wonder if you could
keep an eye on him for me.

629
00:38:50,740 --> 00:38:51,778
Of course.

630
00:38:51,780 --> 00:38:52,943
Good, good.

631
00:38:56,620 --> 00:38:57,663
Keep him on point.

632
00:38:58,570 --> 00:39:00,728
Yeah, make sure he doesn't
do anything stupid again

633
00:39:00,730 --> 00:39:02,310
before this all boils over.

634
00:39:05,270 --> 00:39:06,420
I'll take care of it.

635
00:39:09,820 --> 00:39:11,178
I know you will,

636
00:39:11,180 --> 00:39:12,013
but first

637
00:39:13,020 --> 00:39:13,920
finish your cigar.

638
00:39:15,610 --> 00:39:17,443
A man should never rush a Cuban.

639
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:25,990
Thank you, Colonel.

640
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:30,980
[tense music]

641
00:39:39,482 --> 00:39:42,833
[muffled speaking]

642
00:39:42,835 --> 00:39:44,888
Just remember,

643
00:39:44,890 --> 00:39:46,430
be quick or be dead.

644
00:39:47,475 --> 00:39:50,558
[soft western music]

645
00:40:07,475 --> 00:40:08,808
- Whew.
- Busted.

646
00:40:11,330 --> 00:40:12,218
Let's head upstairs

647
00:40:12,220 --> 00:40:14,028
and have ourselves some fun.

648
00:40:14,030 --> 00:40:14,958
Except for Tucker of course

649
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:16,056
cause he's busted.

650
00:40:16,058 --> 00:40:18,141
[laughs]

651
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:21,378
Well what do you say, boys?

652
00:40:21,380 --> 00:40:22,468
Sounds good to me, Pete.

653
00:40:22,470 --> 00:40:23,720
I'm in at this spot me.

654
00:40:29,882 --> 00:40:31,958
Out a little late
tonight, aren't you Henry?

655
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:33,018
Henry probably has to head home

656
00:40:33,020 --> 00:40:34,958
on account of his old age.

657
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:37,377
[men laughs]

658
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:48,933
I may be older than you boy,

659
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:54,458
but I could still squash your
head like a bug on Sunday.

660
00:40:54,460 --> 00:40:55,738
You remember that.

661
00:40:55,740 --> 00:40:57,593
Okay, okay, let's go.

662
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:02,500
Jesus, you're gonna break my neck!

663
00:41:13,973 --> 00:41:16,473
[tense music]

664
00:41:25,120 --> 00:41:25,953
Get out.

665
00:41:28,060 --> 00:41:28,893
Out!

666
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:32,550
I didn't do anything.

667
00:41:33,747 --> 00:41:37,080
You got a lot of nerve coming up here.

668
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:40,868
You gotta believe me.

669
00:41:40,870 --> 00:41:42,858
I would never hurt Becky.

670
00:41:42,860 --> 00:41:44,360
Yeah, not when you're sober.

671
00:41:46,530 --> 00:41:47,630
I didn't do nothing.

672
00:41:48,540 --> 00:41:49,978
Now we came up here

673
00:41:49,980 --> 00:41:50,880
to have some fun

674
00:41:51,810 --> 00:41:52,710
and I heard

675
00:41:54,060 --> 00:41:55,173
you got a new girl.

676
00:41:57,420 --> 00:41:58,570
I know what you done.

677
00:41:59,470 --> 00:42:01,230
I told you I didn't do nothing.

678
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:04,318
I know you did it.

679
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:05,823
And I have the proof.

680
00:42:09,190 --> 00:42:10,683
Now get out of my place.

681
00:42:13,110 --> 00:42:13,943
Get out.

682
00:42:15,890 --> 00:42:17,640
What are you going to do, shoot me?

683
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:20,513
Or aren't you drunk enough?

684
00:42:21,834 --> 00:42:22,834
Now get out.

685
00:42:24,290 --> 00:42:25,163
Let's go boys.

686
00:42:29,140 --> 00:42:29,973
Let's go boys.

687
00:42:44,184 --> 00:42:45,608
You know,

688
00:42:45,610 --> 00:42:49,147
Mr. Chalmers ain't gonna
be too happy about this.

689
00:42:49,149 --> 00:42:50,803
I don't give two bits.

690
00:42:52,481 --> 00:42:55,286
We'll see about that, won't we.

691
00:42:55,288 --> 00:42:58,062
We will see [mumbles].

692
00:42:58,064 --> 00:43:00,593
There's gonna be a reckoning
coming to this town.

693
00:43:01,980 --> 00:43:03,348
You'll see.

694
00:43:03,350 --> 00:43:04,773
A reckoning, I tell you.

695
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:19,803
Are you okay?

696
00:43:21,650 --> 00:43:22,493
Regina?

697
00:43:24,950 --> 00:43:27,478
I know he's the one
who killed my family.

698
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:29,330
Those are my father's spurs he wears.

699
00:43:30,700 --> 00:43:31,603
Are you sure?

700
00:43:33,260 --> 00:43:34,093
Yes.

701
00:43:37,670 --> 00:43:39,678
My mother had 'em made
special for my father

702
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:40,573
for his birthday.

703
00:43:42,660 --> 00:43:44,460
She gave 'em to him the day he died.

704
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:48,738
She had his initials
inscribed on the inside.

705
00:43:48,740 --> 00:43:49,643
H S.

706
00:44:00,925 --> 00:44:02,618
[speaking in foreign language]

707
00:44:02,620 --> 00:44:03,593
Do you see your initials.

708
00:44:03,595 --> 00:44:06,336
[speaking in foreign language]

709
00:44:06,338 --> 00:44:09,058
[Father] That's beautiful, thank you.

710
00:44:09,060 --> 00:44:10,217
I've been been

711
00:44:11,550 --> 00:44:12,933
searching ever since,

712
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:15,383
going from town to town.

713
00:44:17,901 --> 00:44:19,308
I work in places like this

714
00:44:19,310 --> 00:44:20,923
to meet the local cow hands.

715
00:44:22,350 --> 00:44:24,728
What better disguise was there.

716
00:44:24,730 --> 00:44:26,580
I didn't care how many men touched me

717
00:44:28,301 --> 00:44:30,623
as long as I found the
man who killed my family.

718
00:44:32,200 --> 00:44:33,750
What are you going to do now?

719
00:44:36,530 --> 00:44:37,530
What do you think?

720
00:44:40,510 --> 00:44:41,343
Wait.

721
00:44:42,330 --> 00:44:45,403
Wouldn't it be better if you saw him hang?

722
00:44:47,517 --> 00:44:50,045
I don't know.

723
00:44:50,047 --> 00:44:51,847
I'd be more satisfying to shoot him.

724
00:44:57,240 --> 00:44:59,793
If you can give me a little bit of time,

725
00:45:02,061 --> 00:45:03,228
I have a plan.

726
00:45:09,600 --> 00:45:11,800
I'll give you a very
small amount of time.

727
00:45:13,340 --> 00:45:14,173
This much.

728
00:45:17,450 --> 00:45:18,600
The clock is ticking.

729
00:45:21,858 --> 00:45:25,531
I've had enough of what I
can stomach of that whore.

730
00:45:25,533 --> 00:45:28,798
It's about time she learned her place.

731
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:29,967
Why can't I come, pa?

732
00:45:31,310 --> 00:45:32,713
Best you stay here, Pete.

733
00:45:34,250 --> 00:45:35,083
Pa.

734
00:45:36,100 --> 00:45:37,393
Because I said so.

735
00:45:38,430 --> 00:45:40,138
Ain't you done enough?

736
00:45:40,140 --> 00:45:42,038
This is your mess I'm cleaning up.

737
00:45:42,040 --> 00:45:42,871
I know that, pa.

738
00:45:42,873 --> 00:45:44,208
That's why I wanna come and help.

739
00:45:44,210 --> 00:45:45,648
That's the end of it.

740
00:45:45,650 --> 00:45:46,483
You hear me?

741
00:45:49,175 --> 00:45:51,925
[brooding music]

742
00:46:14,273 --> 00:46:16,158
Let go of me.

743
00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:17,428
Or what?

744
00:46:17,430 --> 00:46:19,908
You're gonna stop talking about my boy.

745
00:46:19,910 --> 00:46:20,743
You hear me?

746
00:46:21,690 --> 00:46:22,908
He killed Becky.

747
00:46:22,910 --> 00:46:24,423
You're not listening.

748
00:46:25,792 --> 00:46:26,978
You know he did it.

749
00:46:26,980 --> 00:46:27,813
Shut up.

750
00:46:28,750 --> 00:46:31,253
All over town, you've
been spreading your lives.

751
00:46:32,950 --> 00:46:34,700
Nobody talks that way about my kid.

752
00:46:37,620 --> 00:46:39,275
I own this town.

753
00:46:39,277 --> 00:46:40,793
And you work for me.

754
00:46:43,160 --> 00:46:44,610
About time you remember that.

755
00:46:47,665 --> 00:46:49,760
If I hear so much as a whisper,

756
00:46:50,850 --> 00:46:51,728

You know that I,

815

I can't pay it in 30 days.

This is Mr. Chalmers' bank.

all of this up with him.

00:56:30,680 --> 00:56:32,588
Can't be babbling your mouth like that.

944
00:56:32,590 --> 00:56:34,773
- I didn't say nothing.
- Shut up, shut up.

945
00:56:38,840 --> 00:56:41,258
Victoria's billiards is now closed.

946
00:56:41,260 --> 00:56:42,093
What?

947
00:56:42,950 --> 00:56:43,988
You heard me.

948
00:56:43,990 --> 00:56:44,843
Closed.

949
00:56:45,760 --> 00:56:47,810
If I hear of any of you heading up there,

950
00:56:48,760 --> 00:56:50,583
you're going to have to deal with me.

951
00:56:52,500 --> 00:56:54,050
Have a good evening, gentlemen.

952
00:57:00,730 --> 00:57:01,728
It's all ready.

953
00:57:01,730 --> 00:57:02,653
Wonderful.

954
00:57:04,830 --> 00:57:07,233
Could do keep this for safekeeping?

955
00:57:08,890 --> 00:57:10,768
I sure can, honey.

956
00:57:10,770 --> 00:57:12,270
Is this is what I think it is?

957
00:57:14,810 --> 00:57:15,643
It is.

958
00:57:18,110 --> 00:57:20,238
Are you sure you're up to this?

959
00:57:20,240 --> 00:57:22,018
Honey, I am so sure.

960
00:57:22,020 --> 00:57:23,391
What's happened to this little town,

961
00:57:23,393 --> 00:57:25,608
it's just made me so unhappy.

962
00:57:25,610 --> 00:57:27,463
Chalmers and his men be damned.

963
00:57:30,830 --> 00:57:32,363
Oh no, no charge.

964
00:57:33,490 --> 00:57:35,043
You be careful out there.

965
00:57:37,760 --> 00:57:39,376
I will.

966
00:57:39,378 --> 00:57:41,795
[soft music]

967
00:58:10,176 --> 00:58:12,926
[dramatic music]

968
00:58:16,621 --> 00:58:17,781
What are you doing?

969
00:58:17,783 --> 00:58:18,614
This is what I'm doing.

970
00:58:18,616 --> 00:58:19,449
Everybody shut up.

971
00:58:22,263 --> 00:58:24,619
You're coming with me.

972
00:58:24,621 --> 00:58:27,121
[tense music]

973
00:58:38,540 --> 00:58:41,228
How could you take a child?

974
00:58:41,230 --> 00:58:43,478
That's a bold accusation, Victoria.

975
00:58:43,480 --> 00:58:45,643
A bold accusation, indeed.

976
00:58:46,620 --> 00:58:48,220
This is in fact quite unfounded.

977
00:58:50,038 --> 00:58:51,958
Although I do recognize the pain

978
00:58:51,960 --> 00:58:54,598
of having a child removed,

979
00:58:54,600 --> 00:58:57,278
much as my Pete was taken from me.

980
00:58:57,280 --> 00:58:58,863
How could you do it?

981
00:59:00,900 --> 00:59:03,153
And how could you let him do it?

982
00:59:04,580 --> 00:59:07,623
Nobody is letting anybody do anything.

983
00:59:10,630 --> 00:59:11,773
She's your daughter.

984
00:59:13,010 --> 00:59:14,113
The child,

985
00:59:15,230 --> 00:59:17,843
based on your profession at the time,

986
00:59:18,700 --> 00:59:21,445
could have any number of fathers.

987
00:59:21,447 --> 00:59:23,298
A moments of weakness and your chamber

988
00:59:23,300 --> 00:59:26,028
hardly makes me a candidate.

989
00:59:26,030 --> 00:59:28,598
While you might as well
assign every man in this town

990
00:59:28,600 --> 00:59:29,433
was the father.

991
00:59:31,060 --> 00:59:32,833
You're the devil himself.

992
00:59:34,380 --> 00:59:35,793
I think you better go.

993
00:59:38,261 --> 00:59:40,363
And you,

994
00:59:40,365 --> 00:59:42,123
you're bought and paid for sheriff.

995
00:59:50,300 --> 00:59:52,138
We all set with Pete?

996
00:59:52,140 --> 00:59:53,140
Yes, sir, Colonel.

997
00:59:54,800 --> 00:59:56,663
I got men going there now.

998
00:59:59,143 --> 01:00:01,643
[tense music]

999
01:00:09,725 --> 01:00:11,068
Are you okay?

1000
01:00:11,070 --> 01:00:12,708
They took Sarah.

1001
01:00:12,710 --> 01:00:13,541
Who?

1002
01:00:13,543 --> 01:00:14,523
Chalmers.

1003
01:00:16,350 --> 01:00:17,483
Where are you going?

1004
01:00:19,180 --> 01:00:20,085
Your time is up.

1005
01:00:20,087 --> 01:00:22,398
I'm going to kill Pete.

1006
01:00:22,400 --> 01:00:23,543
What about Sarah?

1007
01:00:25,140 --> 01:00:26,713
We have to find her.

1008
01:00:27,690 --> 01:00:29,123
Or don't you even care?

1009
01:00:34,070 --> 01:00:35,320
You better get changed.

1010
01:00:36,761 --> 01:00:39,261
[tense music]

1011
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:49,528
It was Beau Carmichael and
John Tucker who'd done it.

1012
01:00:49,530 --> 01:00:51,058
How do you know?

1013
01:00:51,060 --> 01:00:53,608
I heard him talking in the saloon.

1014
01:00:53,610 --> 01:00:55,308
I know where they took her too.

1015
01:00:55,310 --> 01:00:56,388
Where?

1016
01:00:56,390 --> 01:00:58,708
That little cabin up on Slate Ridge.

1017
01:00:58,710 --> 01:01:01,038
That the little one that's
backed up in the hill?

1018
01:01:01,040 --> 01:01:02,738
Yep, that's the one.

1019
01:01:02,740 --> 01:01:04,568
That's what they were saying anyway.

1020
01:01:04,570 --> 01:01:05,520
Thank you Johnny.

1021
01:01:08,170 --> 01:01:09,003
Be careful.

1022
01:01:11,925 --> 01:01:14,425
[tense music]

1023
01:01:20,688 --> 01:01:24,238
Now, I'm in that cabin over there.

1024
01:01:24,240 --> 01:01:27,188
If you so much as poke your head out

1025
01:01:27,190 --> 01:01:28,238
like a rabbit and a hole,

1026
01:01:28,240 --> 01:01:30,598
I will shoot you in your eye.

1027
01:01:30,600 --> 01:01:31,500
You understand me?

1028
01:01:32,587 --> 01:01:33,437
Now get in there.

1029
01:01:38,031 --> 01:01:40,543
You stay, you hear me.

1030
01:01:40,545 --> 01:01:43,045
[tense music]

1031
01:02:05,379 --> 01:02:08,212
[Victoria] How we gonna do this?

1032
01:02:10,591 --> 01:02:12,674
[Regina] We just do it.

1033
01:02:19,250 --> 01:02:20,083
Beat that.

1034
01:02:22,630 --> 01:02:23,719
There you go.

1035
01:02:23,721 --> 01:02:24,938
[laughs]

1036
01:02:24,940 --> 01:02:26,868
Who says I ain't good at cards?

1037
01:02:26,870 --> 01:02:27,928
All right, Johnny boy.

1038
01:02:27,930 --> 01:02:29,328
Yeah, take me for one.

1039
01:02:29,330 --> 01:02:30,558
Take me for one.

1040
01:02:30,560 --> 01:02:32,008
Alrighty.

1041
01:02:32,010 --> 01:02:33,563
Let me do 'em again to
make that money back.

1042
01:02:36,361 --> 01:02:38,698
[gun shot fires]

1043
01:02:38,700 --> 01:02:39,800
Where's my daughter?

1044
01:02:41,263 --> 01:02:42,698
Your daughter?

1045
01:02:42,700 --> 01:02:44,288
I don't know nothing about your daughter.

1046
01:02:44,290 --> 01:02:45,459
I know you took her.

1047
01:02:45,461 --> 01:02:46,563
You do not.

1048
01:02:47,525 --> 01:02:49,075
Victoria, step away from him.

1049
01:02:52,050 --> 01:02:52,883
Where is she?

1050
01:02:54,050 --> 01:02:56,268
I ain't saying nothing.

1051
01:02:56,270 --> 01:02:58,179
How do you like them apples?

1052
01:02:58,181 --> 01:02:59,808
[gun shot fires]

1053
01:02:59,810 --> 01:03:00,643
Son of a.

1054
01:03:03,150 --> 01:03:04,498
Where is she?

1055
01:03:04,500 --> 01:03:06,397
Don't tell 'em nothing, Tuck.

1056
01:03:06,399 --> 01:03:07,488
No, no, no.

1057
01:03:07,490 --> 01:03:08,773
Don't shoot, don't shoot.

1058
01:03:09,960 --> 01:03:11,848
She's in the root cellar out back.

1059
01:03:11,850 --> 01:03:12,683
Go check.

1060
01:03:21,781 --> 01:03:24,198
[soft music]

1061
01:03:25,280 --> 01:03:26,143
Sarah?

1062
01:03:27,410 --> 01:03:28,323
Sarah?

1063
01:03:29,722 --> 01:03:31,178
[Sarah] Mama?

1064
01:03:31,180 --> 01:03:32,263
[Victoria] Sarah.

1065
01:03:40,390 --> 01:03:41,548
No.

1066
01:03:41,550 --> 01:03:43,118
Take Sarah out.

1067
01:03:43,120 --> 01:03:45,098
She doesn't need to see this.

1068
01:03:45,100 --> 01:03:46,104
No.

1069
01:03:46,106 --> 01:03:47,723
We're not like them.

1070
01:03:48,789 --> 01:03:49,620
Go!

1071
01:03:49,622 --> 01:03:50,453
Please.

1072
01:03:50,455 --> 01:03:52,103
Don't shoot me.

1073
01:03:52,105 --> 01:03:52,938
Regina!

1074
01:03:55,589 --> 01:03:58,089
[tense music]

1075
01:04:00,770 --> 01:04:01,923
You're too soft.

1076
01:04:26,165 --> 01:04:28,418
[gun shot fires]

1077
01:04:28,420 --> 01:04:29,251
Are you hit?

1078
01:04:29,253 --> 01:04:30,084
Yes.

1079
01:04:30,086 --> 01:04:31,155
Can you ride?

1080
01:04:31,157 --> 01:04:32,467
Yes.

1081
01:04:32,469 --> 01:04:33,886
Okay, let's go.

1082
01:04:51,825 --> 01:04:54,492
I didn't do nothing, you know,

1083
01:04:55,350 --> 01:04:56,283
nothing at all.

1084
01:04:57,800 --> 01:04:59,308
Is that so?

1085
01:04:59,310 --> 01:05:00,808
Yes sir.

1086
01:05:00,810 --> 01:05:02,398
Marshal.

1087
01:05:02,400 --> 01:05:03,648
That's a fact.

1088
01:05:03,650 --> 01:05:04,483
She's lying.

1089
01:05:06,840 --> 01:05:08,390
You can tell it to the judge.

1090
01:05:10,320 --> 01:05:11,178
The judge.

1091
01:05:11,180 --> 01:05:12,378
What does he know?

1092
01:05:12,380 --> 01:05:14,627
He doesn't know anything about this.

1093
01:05:14,629 --> 01:05:16,408
Why don't you try and
get some sleep, son.

1094
01:05:16,410 --> 01:05:17,243
Sleep?

1095
01:05:18,650 --> 01:05:19,481
I can't sleep.

1096
01:05:19,483 --> 01:05:21,110
Could you sleep in these iron cuffs?

1097
01:05:22,120 --> 01:05:23,758
No one could.

1098
01:05:23,760 --> 01:05:24,960
I'm trapped like a hawk.

1099
01:05:27,540 --> 01:05:29,448
Aren't you afraid that I'm
going to bash you on the head

1100
01:05:29,450 --> 01:05:30,800
in the middle of the night?

1101
01:05:31,780 --> 01:05:32,613
Not really.

1102
01:05:34,400 --> 01:05:35,233
Well,

1103
01:05:36,970 --> 01:05:37,820
maybe you should.

1104
01:05:41,960 --> 01:05:45,148
I've been doing this kind
of work a long time son,

1105
01:05:45,150 --> 01:05:48,118
longer than you've been
breathing on God's green earth

1106
01:05:48,120 --> 01:05:49,438
and I've dealt with worse killers

1107
01:05:49,440 --> 01:05:51,388
than you could ever imagine,

1108
01:05:51,390 --> 01:05:52,973
really bad men,

1109
01:05:53,920 --> 01:05:56,870
men that I would not dare shut
my eyes for even an instant.

1110
01:05:58,180 --> 01:06:00,398
Oh, you're a killer all right,

1111
01:06:00,400 --> 01:06:01,853
a killer of women.

1112
01:06:02,820 --> 01:06:06,288
When I look into your eyes,
I see fear of looking back.

1113
01:06:06,290 --> 01:06:07,123
So for you,

1114
01:06:08,405 --> 01:06:11,633
I can nap all day and not
so much as worry a lick.

1115
01:06:12,560 --> 01:06:15,142
Now shut up and go to sleep.

1116
01:06:15,144 --> 01:06:17,561
[soft music]

1117
01:06:28,470 --> 01:06:30,470
I've done the best I could do for now.

1118
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:34,258
I'll leave you with this medicine.

1119
01:06:34,260 --> 01:06:36,523
I doubt Chalmers will
let me see you again.

1120
01:06:38,560 --> 01:06:40,710
She should be feeling
better in a few days.

1121
01:06:45,910 --> 01:06:46,923
What do we do now?

1122
01:06:49,002 --> 01:06:51,598
If they don't come, the bank will take it.

1123
01:06:51,600 --> 01:06:54,228
And then we wouldn't have anywhere to go.

1124
01:06:54,230 --> 01:06:55,330
They'll come for us.

1125
01:06:58,680 --> 01:07:00,388
We should just leave town.

1126
01:07:00,390 --> 01:07:01,448
What about my mom?

1127
01:07:01,450 --> 01:07:02,683
She can't travel.

1128
01:07:05,730 --> 01:07:06,563
We can fight.

1129
01:07:08,580 --> 01:07:09,823
Against Chalmers?

1130
01:07:11,850 --> 01:07:12,693
Ekta's right.

1131
01:07:13,720 --> 01:07:14,553
We fight.

1132
01:07:16,180 --> 01:07:17,013
How?

1133
01:07:19,050 --> 01:07:20,850
For certain they will come for us.

1134
01:07:21,930 --> 01:07:24,243
But not before Chalmers is back.

1135
01:07:25,480 --> 01:07:27,978
Tomorrow, we'll go after them.

1136
01:07:27,980 --> 01:07:29,248
We'll start with Sheriff Ben,

1137
01:07:29,250 --> 01:07:30,838
me and Cora.

1138
01:07:30,840 --> 01:07:33,563
The rest stay here and look
after it Victoria and Sarah.

1139
01:07:36,580 --> 01:07:37,413
Don't worry.

1140
01:07:38,770 --> 01:07:39,603
You're ready.

1141
01:07:41,028 --> 01:07:43,445
[soft music]

1142
01:08:04,650 --> 01:08:07,150
[tense music]

1143
01:08:08,810 --> 01:08:10,038
What are you doing?

1144
01:08:10,040 --> 01:08:11,318
Are you crazy?

1145
01:08:11,320 --> 01:08:12,973
Yeah, I am.

1146
01:08:14,100 --> 01:08:14,933
Get up.

1147
01:08:17,840 --> 01:08:20,727
There's still time for you
whores to get out of town.

1148
01:08:20,729 --> 01:08:21,561
Yeah, well,

1149
01:08:21,563 --> 01:08:23,118
I'm not running anywhere.

1150
01:08:23,120 --> 01:08:24,658
Well you ought to.

1151
01:08:24,660 --> 01:08:26,067
Get in.

1152
01:08:26,069 --> 01:08:27,351
Now hold on a second.

1153
01:08:27,353 --> 01:08:29,437
[groans]

1154
01:08:34,059 --> 01:08:36,248
Chalmers is on his way here right now.

1155
01:08:36,250 --> 01:08:38,383
And he aims to shoot you all.

1156
01:08:39,399 --> 01:08:41,078
The whole town knows it.

1157
01:08:41,080 --> 01:08:43,067
Well, you tell him he can find us

1158
01:08:43,069 --> 01:08:45,323
down the street at Johnny Brown's.

1159
01:08:46,380 --> 01:08:47,483
He'll kill you all.

1160
01:08:48,969 --> 01:08:50,093
Damn whores.

1161
01:08:51,412 --> 01:08:54,662
[church bells tolling]

1162
01:09:00,550 --> 01:09:03,088
So this is where you
want to make your stand?

1163
01:09:03,090 --> 01:09:05,008
Yeah, it take away from Victoria's.

1164
01:09:05,010 --> 01:09:07,133
Is that okay with you?

1165
01:09:07,135 --> 01:09:08,418
Sure.

1166
01:09:08,420 --> 01:09:09,253
Sure.

1167
01:09:10,250 --> 01:09:11,083
How was she?

1168
01:09:12,540 --> 01:09:14,525
She's holding her own.

1169
01:09:14,527 --> 01:09:15,943
Good, and Sarah?

1170
01:09:17,754 --> 01:09:18,836
She's fine.

1171
01:09:20,309 --> 01:09:21,490
Okay.

1172
01:09:21,492 --> 01:09:22,452
The place is yours.

1173
01:09:23,910 --> 01:09:24,743
Thank you.

1174
01:09:26,080 --> 01:09:28,380
It's terrible what's
happening to this town.

1175
01:09:30,938 --> 01:09:33,328
That's what everybody keeps saying.

1176
01:09:33,330 --> 01:09:35,473
You all could have done
something about it.

1177
01:09:37,050 --> 01:09:38,399
Yeah, I know it, I just

1178
01:09:39,569 --> 01:09:40,969
ain't never been in a fight.

1179
01:09:42,590 --> 01:09:43,783
That makes two of us.

1180
01:09:43,785 --> 01:09:44,618
Yeah.

1181
01:10:28,170 --> 01:10:30,717
Now, Ben, what would
you be doing in there?

1182
01:10:30,719 --> 01:10:32,123
They got the jump on me.

1183
01:10:33,900 --> 01:10:35,050
Get him out of there.

1184
01:10:47,190 --> 01:10:49,458
They said they'd meet
you down at Johnny Brown's.

1185
01:10:49,460 --> 01:10:50,710
Oh, they did, did they?

1186
01:10:52,700 --> 01:10:53,723
Damn whores.

1187
01:10:54,920 --> 01:10:55,751
Get your gun.

1188
01:10:55,753 --> 01:10:56,585
Let's go.

1189
01:11:00,561 --> 01:11:03,061
[tense music]

1190
01:11:08,300 --> 01:11:09,868
You four,

1191
01:11:09,870 --> 01:11:12,158
head over the whore house
and shoot them whores

1192
01:11:12,160 --> 01:11:12,993
you find there.

1193
01:11:14,219 --> 01:11:16,518
The rest of you, with me.

1194
01:11:16,520 --> 01:11:17,353
Let's go.

1195
01:11:24,813 --> 01:11:28,198
Are you supposed to feel
this way before a fight?

1196
01:11:28,200 --> 01:11:29,032
How's that?

1197
01:11:31,050 --> 01:11:31,893
Butterflies.

1198
01:11:33,059 --> 01:11:33,893
Yeah.

1199
01:11:35,070 --> 01:11:35,901
No worry.

1200
01:11:35,903 --> 01:11:37,223
They go away once you start shooting.

1201
01:11:39,490 --> 01:11:41,338
That's encouraging.

1202
01:11:41,340 --> 01:11:42,190
You'll be fine.

1203
01:11:43,593 --> 01:11:45,636
Look, I'm sorry I was mean to you

1204
01:11:45,638 --> 01:11:46,825
when you first showed up.

1205
01:11:46,827 --> 01:11:48,463
It's just Becky and I,

1206
01:11:49,590 --> 01:11:50,423
we were close.

1207
01:11:51,730 --> 01:11:52,563
That's okay.

1208
01:11:55,190 --> 01:11:57,028
You forgive me then?

1209
01:11:57,030 --> 01:11:58,103
I already have.

1210
01:12:01,540 --> 01:12:02,503
Sisters then.

1211
01:12:05,410 --> 01:12:06,346
To the end.

1214
01:13:01,648 --> 01:13:03,686
That's coming from Victoria's.

1218
01:13:48,710 --> 01:13:50,384
Give me that.

1219
01:13:50,386 --> 01:13:52,018
No.

1220
01:13:52,020 --> 01:13:53,469
Now where's the little one?

1221
01:13:55,550 --> 01:13:57,108
She's not here.

1222
01:13:57,110 --> 01:13:57,943
Where is she?

1223
01:14:00,600 --> 01:14:02,618
I said she's not here.

1224
01:14:02,620 --> 01:14:03,770
Too bad for you then.

1225
01:14:06,269 --> 01:14:07,686
Don't hurt her.

1226

[tense western music]

1228
01:14:33,850 --> 01:14:37,293
You whores should've left
town when you had the chance.

1229
01:14:46,389 --> 01:14:48,093
You the one that wants to shoot me?

1230
01:14:50,380 --> 01:14:51,911
That's right.

1231
01:14:51,913 --> 01:14:52,913
Here I am.

Oh Lord.

1245
01:17:26,008 --> 01:17:27,387
They're coming.

1246
01:17:27,389 --> 01:17:28,639
No, no, no, no.

1247
01:17:30,610 --> 01:17:32,410
What are you doing inside, Virgil?

1248
01:17:34,059 --> 01:17:35,838
Come on, I need you.

1249
01:17:35,840 --> 01:17:37,024
You too.

1250
01:17:37,026 --> 01:17:38,328
What, I'm a barber.

1251
01:17:38,330 --> 01:17:39,161
I don't care.

1252
01:17:39,163 --> 01:17:40,107
You're coming with me.

1253
01:17:40,109 --> 01:17:41,605
Let's go.

[western music]

1255
01:18:12,003 --> 01:18:13,548
You,

1256
01:18:13,550 --> 01:18:14,381
I'll let you leave

1257
01:18:14,383 --> 01:18:15,998
if you leave right now.

1258
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:16,900
I'm not leaving.

1259
01:18:17,990 --> 01:18:20,198
This ain't even your flight.

1260
01:18:20,200 --> 01:18:21,250
You're not from here.

1261
01:18:22,150 --> 01:18:23,000
What do you want?

1262
01:18:23,870 --> 01:18:25,368
I want your son.

1263
01:18:25,370 --> 01:18:26,448
My son?

1264
01:18:26,450 --> 01:18:27,333
That's right.

1265
01:18:28,291 --> 01:18:30,226
It makes no sense.

1266
01:18:30,228 --> 01:18:32,023
He killed my family.

1267
01:18:41,130 --> 01:18:43,348
I see you, Ida McCann.

1268
01:18:43,350 --> 01:18:44,548
Now you go on home,

1269
01:18:44,550 --> 01:18:46,137
or I'll take your shop.

1270
01:18:46,139 --> 01:18:47,782
No, I'm staying.

1271
01:18:48,809 --> 01:18:50,059
Then I'll kill you too.

1272
01:18:51,150 --> 01:18:51,983
Johnny Brown,

1273
01:18:53,615 --> 01:18:54,514
you're a dead man.

[gun shots firing]
[western music]

1275
01:19:23,105 --> 01:19:25,255
Pete, stop or I'll
shoot you in the back.

1276
01:19:26,219 --> 01:19:27,053
Drop your gun.

1277
01:19:32,010 --> 01:19:32,843
Turn around.

1278
01:19:40,374 --> 01:19:41,628
Okay, put the gun down.

1279
01:19:41,630 --> 01:19:42,985
Please put the gun down.

1280
01:19:42,987 --> 01:19:44,587
You don't remember me, do you?

1281
01:19:46,933 --> 01:19:47,858
No.

1282
01:19:47,860 --> 01:19:49,328
No, who are you?

1283
01:19:49,330 --> 01:19:50,430
Take off your spurs.

1284
01:20:06,840 --> 01:20:07,993
Hurry up Pete!

1285
01:20:12,800 --> 01:20:14,278
These belonged to my father.

1286
01:20:14,280 --> 01:20:15,282
You remember me now?

1287
01:20:17,770 --> 01:20:18,958
No.

1288
01:20:18,960 --> 01:20:20,098
Okay, okay, put the gun down,

1289
01:20:20,100 --> 01:20:21,538
put that down.

1290
01:20:21,540 --> 01:20:22,373
Please.

1291
01:20:27,400 --> 01:20:28,467
I was drunk.

1292
01:20:28,469 --> 01:20:29,698
Okay, okay, I'm sorry.

1293
01:20:29,700 --> 01:20:30,993
Don't shoot, don't shoot.

1294
01:20:32,510 --> 01:20:33,849
I will be there the
day they tie the noose

1295
01:20:33,851 --> 01:20:35,243
around your neck.

1296
01:20:55,340 --> 01:20:56,893
You got any final words?

1297
01:21:06,380 --> 01:21:07,630
I just want to say that

1298
01:21:10,347 --> 01:21:11,620
I didn't mean no harm

1299
01:21:13,360 --> 01:21:14,193
to anyone.

1300
01:21:16,730 --> 01:21:18,780
Every bad thing that I've done in my life

1301
01:21:21,440 --> 01:21:23,303
was because of the drink alcohol.

1302
01:21:24,825 --> 01:21:25,907
And I'm sorry

1303
01:21:29,924 --> 01:21:30,924
to everyone.

1304
01:21:36,750 --> 01:21:38,373
If I can do it again,

1305
01:21:40,630 --> 01:21:41,880
I'd be sure to do better.

1306
01:21:46,755 --> 01:21:48,291
That's all.

1307
01:21:48,293 --> 01:21:50,876
[somber music]

1308
01:22:05,290 --> 01:22:06,478
That should do it.

1309
01:22:06,480 --> 01:22:08,758
As Mr. Chalmers only remaining heir,

1310
01:22:08,760 --> 01:22:10,887
Sarah Bonham is now the legal owner

1311
01:22:10,889 --> 01:22:14,008
