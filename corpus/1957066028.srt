I can feel his pulse.

730
00:37:58,679 --> 00:37:59,747
I might have broken his nose,
though.

731
00:37:59,781 --> 00:38:00,313
I'm sorry about that.

I'd offer you my hand, but well,
you'd probably keep it.

00:38:25,372 --> 00:38:28,943
Hey,
before you do anything rash,

745
00:38:28,976 --> 00:38:34,715

is squeeze.

746
00:38:34,749 --> 00:38:37,384
So you and I are gonna make
a little deal

747
00:38:37,417 --> 00:38:41,354

748
00:38:41,388 --> 00:38:45,660
If you let me go,
I'll let him go.

Alright?

750

In fact, I'm gonna make it
even easier for you.

751
00:38:49,797 --> 00:38:52,700
All you gotta do is
give me that knife right there

752
00:38:52,733 --> 00:38:53,968
and I'll release him.

1454
01:26:16,644 --> 01:26:17,812
Do you want it?

1455
01:26:17,845 --> 01:26:19,947
Eat it, Pati!

1456
01:26:21,849 --> 01:26:23,216
[grunting]

1457
01:26:24,619 --> 01:26:27,622
[grunting]

1458
01:26:33,493 --> 01:26:36,363
You sick, twisted fuck.

1459
01:26:36,396 --> 01:26:39,366
[taking deep breaths]

1460
01:26:39,399 --> 01:26:46,373
[♪♪♪]

1461
01:26:46,406 --> 01:26:49,409
Any more giant siblings
I should know about, Alia?

1462
01:26:52,479 --> 01:26:53,848
No, no.

1463
01:26:53,881 --> 01:26:55,950
We're safe now.

1464
01:26:55,983 --> 01:27:10,598
[♪♪♪]

1465
01:27:10,631 --> 01:27:12,600
[Rex's conscience]
That was a good last line.

1466
01:27:12,633 --> 01:27:14,569
"Eat it, Pati!"

1467
01:27:14,602 --> 01:27:17,972
That's from Misery, right?

1468
01:27:18,005 --> 01:27:18,873
Yeah.

1469
01:27:19,540 --> 01:27:20,975
Yeah, it was good, it was good.

1470
01:27:21,008 --> 01:27:23,711
You know, what would have been
better, though?

1471
01:27:23,745 --> 01:27:25,880
It's if you said something
along the lines of uh,

1472
01:27:25,913 --> 01:27:28,616
"You're finished", you know?

1473
01:27:28,649 --> 01:27:32,285
Or something like,
"Finish your vegetables.

1474
01:27:32,319 --> 01:27:32,854
Uh."

1475
01:27:32,887 --> 01:27:34,889
You know what I mean?

1476
01:27:34,922 --> 01:27:35,890
Because they're...

1477
01:27:35,923 --> 01:27:36,524
You know, anything
with finish in it really,

1478
01:27:36,557 --> 01:27:38,760
because they are Finnish.

1479
01:27:45,733 --> 01:28:00,548
[♪♪♪]

1480
01:28:00,581 --> 01:28:02,415
[Rex]
So when we get there,

1481
01:28:02,449 --> 01:28:03,785
what do you wanna do
with you little brother?

1482
01:28:03,818 --> 01:28:04,819
Kill him?

1483
01:28:04,852 --> 01:28:06,521
[Alia chuckling]

1484
01:28:06,554 --> 01:28:07,522
[Alia]
No!

1485
01:28:07,555 --> 01:28:09,657
We're taking him with us.

1486
01:28:09,690 --> 01:28:11,826
[Rex]
Oh, okay.

1487
01:28:11,859 --> 01:28:12,860
Okay.

1488
01:28:14,662 --> 01:28:17,665
[kissing]

1489
01:28:22,103 --> 01:28:25,740
[Olivia]
So how did you two meet?

1490
01:28:25,773 --> 01:28:29,544
Uh, well,

1491
01:28:29,577 --> 01:28:33,748
I was on vacation in Finland.

1492
01:28:33,781 --> 01:28:37,718
And uh,
and her parents hated me.

1493
01:28:37,752 --> 01:28:38,719
[chuckling]

1494
01:28:38,753 --> 01:28:40,655
Uh, like biblically hated me.

1495
01:28:40,688 --> 01:28:41,789
[chuckling]

1496
01:28:41,823 --> 01:28:45,993
Alright, anyway, it turns out,
she had four brothers.

1497
01:28:46,027 --> 01:28:47,360
You know,
each was a little quirky

1498
01:28:47,394 --> 01:29:02,342
[♪♪♪]

1499
01:29:02,342 --> 01:29:07,148
[♪♪♪]

1500
01:29:07,181 --> 01:29:20,795
[♪♪♪]

1501
01:29:21,963 --> 01:29:24,397
[Rex]
So I killed her entire family

1502
01:29:24,431 --> 01:29:27,400
and we've been a couple
ever since.

1503
01:29:27,434 --> 01:29:30,437
[indistinct Chatter]

1504
01:29:36,744 --> 01:29:37,912
What?

1505
01:29:37,945 --> 01:29:46,954
[♪♪♪]
