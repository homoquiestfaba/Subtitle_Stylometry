1
00:01:27,125 --> 00:01:28,666
Good morning, Mr. Bryce.

2
00:01:28,750 --> 00:01:30,666
I trust the pickup ran smoothly.

3
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:32,125
Handoff was clean.

4
00:01:32,208 --> 00:01:33,583
No stops till the exit point.

5
00:01:37,375 --> 00:01:39,250
Clear roads all
the way, Chief...

6
00:01:40,333 --> 00:01:42,083
just as you predicted.

7
00:01:42,166 --> 00:01:44,206
Thank you for agreeing to
an earlier departure time,

8
00:01:44,230 --> 00:01:44,916
Mr. Kurosawa.

9
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,360
I'm honored that
you and your wives

10
00:01:46,384 --> 00:01:48,592
have entrusted a Triple A
Protection Service today.

11
00:01:53,375 --> 00:01:54,458
Moving red to green option

12
00:01:54,541 --> 00:01:56,458
coming in on your vector.

13
00:01:56,541 --> 00:01:57,666
Get the engine started.

14
00:01:57,750 --> 00:01:59,083
I want immediate takeoff.

15
00:01:59,166 --> 00:02:00,875
Air space has already
been cleared.

16
00:02:00,958 --> 00:02:02,416
Roger that.

17
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:03,416
All channels moving to

18
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:04,791
restricted air space.

19
00:02:09,583 --> 00:02:10,583
Shall we?

20
00:02:24,458 --> 00:02:27,083
Mr. Kurosawa...

21
00:02:27,166 --> 00:02:28,791
Safe travels.

22
00:02:28,875 --> 00:02:30,625
Thank you very much, Michael.

23
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:37,125
Another Triple A delivery, sir.

24
00:02:37,208 --> 00:02:38,500
Stay with him till
he's airborne.

25
00:02:38,583 --> 00:02:39,458
Yes, sir.

26
00:02:39,541 --> 00:02:40,791
Canvas is clear?

27
00:02:40,875 --> 00:02:42,083
Nothing for miles, Chief.

28
00:02:42,166 --> 00:02:43,166
Almost boring.

29
00:02:43,208 --> 00:02:45,208
And what's our motto?

30
00:02:45,291 --> 00:02:46,583
Boring is always best.

31
00:02:57,125 --> 00:02:58,708
Move! Move!

32
00:02:58,791 --> 00:03:00,291
Client down! Client down!

33
00:03:00,375 --> 00:03:01,833
Code 7! Code 7!

34
00:03:01,916 --> 00:03:02,791
Jesus!

35
00:03:02,875 --> 00:03:04,750
It's like a goddamn
milkshake in here!

36
00:03:04,833 --> 00:03:06,541
Bravo 1 down.

37
00:03:06,625 --> 00:03:08,166
We need a clean-up
team in here now!

38
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:10,333
Repeat, Bravo 1 down.

39
00:04:03,833 --> 00:04:05,333
Fucking piece of
paper I've got here.

40
00:04:07,833 --> 00:04:09,416
I don't have fucking time.

41
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:13,708
Holy shit.

42
00:04:18,833 --> 00:04:22,458
Mr. Seifert.

43
00:04:22,541 --> 00:04:24,833
- Are we ready to go?
- Are we ready?

44
00:04:24,916 --> 00:04:25,916
I've been waiting!

45
00:04:25,958 --> 00:04:28,708
What the hell took you so long?
It's half past nine!

46
00:04:28,791 --> 00:04:30,471
Apologies. I had to
make some preparations.

47
00:04:30,495 --> 00:04:33,041
Mr. Seifert. Mr. Seifert!

48
00:04:33,125 --> 00:04:35,125
It's best if I go
through doors first.

49
00:04:37,583 --> 00:04:39,017
I don't think you know what
I'm dealing with here.

50
00:04:39,041 --> 00:04:40,291
Come on, let's go, let's go.

51
00:04:40,375 --> 00:04:43,125
- Let's go. Double time.
- These people are animals!

52
00:04:43,208 --> 00:04:45,059
They're probably... they're
probably here already,

53
00:04:45,083 --> 00:04:46,523
just... just waiting
for me to leave.

54
00:04:46,547 --> 00:04:47,922
I can appreciate your concern,

55
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,083
but I assure you, you
are perfectly safe.

56
00:04:50,166 --> 00:04:52,166
All you need to do is
exactly what I tell you.

57
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:53,916
Mr. Seifert? Mr. Seifert?

58
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,458
This way, please.

59
00:04:55,541 --> 00:04:57,750
All right, is it not enough
cocaine, or too much?

60
00:05:01,208 --> 00:05:03,166
They say you're Triple A rated.

61
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:04,583
Is that a real thing?

62
00:05:04,666 --> 00:05:07,750
Let's just focus on you
dying of natural causes,

63
00:05:07,833 --> 00:05:09,333
shall we?

64
00:05:09,416 --> 00:05:10,500
Soon.

65
00:05:10,583 --> 00:05:13,458
- That's my car.
- Take a mental picture of it.

66
00:05:13,541 --> 00:05:15,541
I find it safer if
we're using a car

67
00:05:15,625 --> 00:05:17,416
that blends in with the
surrounding traffic.

68
00:05:19,416 --> 00:05:20,416
Well, that was easy.

69
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:22,166
In fact, practically
nothing at all.

70
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:24,450
- Boring is always best.
- I trust you'll reduce your...

71
00:05:26,541 --> 00:05:28,166
What? This is Michael Bryce.

72
00:05:28,239 --> 00:05:29,559
I'm an executive
protection agent,

73
00:05:29,583 --> 00:05:31,143
fully licensed and
bonded within the EU.

74
00:05:31,167 --> 00:05:32,375
Fuckin' hell. I know it's you.

75
00:05:32,458 --> 00:05:33,708
I've got caller ID!

76
00:05:33,791 --> 00:05:35,500
Such a fucking dick.

77
00:05:35,583 --> 00:05:37,125
You got a pickup for me or what?

78
00:05:37,208 --> 00:05:38,541
Yes. I've extracted my client

79
00:05:38,625 --> 00:05:40,958
from 27 Saint George Street.

80
00:05:41,041 --> 00:05:42,041
Cleanup is required.

81
00:05:43,333 --> 00:05:45,083
On the seventh floor,
north stairwell...

82
00:05:45,166 --> 00:05:46,833
I've left a French national

83
00:05:46,916 --> 00:05:48,396
employed by the Taray
Crime syndicate.

84
00:05:49,916 --> 00:05:51,636
You'll find two more in
the south stairwell.

85
00:05:51,666 --> 00:05:53,146
On the roof, you're
gonna find another

86
00:05:53,170 --> 00:05:54,711
who's gonna need
some dental work.

87
00:05:56,375 --> 00:05:57,916
In the alley, there's
two gentlemen

88
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,291
who may require some counseling.

89
00:06:01,666 --> 00:06:03,208
One more in the east office,

90
00:06:03,291 --> 00:06:05,500
on the sixth floor
under construction...

91
00:06:05,583 --> 00:06:08,000
and one on the number
three elevator.

92
00:06:11,083 --> 00:06:13,083
Oh, oh, oh, parking garage,

93
00:06:13,166 --> 00:06:14,646
under the Rolls Royce
in space five...

94
00:06:14,708 --> 00:06:16,188
there's a pound of
plastic explosives,

95
00:06:16,212 --> 00:06:17,812
so you might want to
call the bomb squad.

96
00:06:19,708 --> 00:06:22,083
Check that. Make it
the fire department.

97
00:06:22,166 --> 00:06:24,083
- Is that my car?
- I'm afraid so.

98
00:06:24,166 --> 00:06:25,708
Have a seat, it's
been a long day.

99
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:33,708
That was a custom Rolls
Royce, one of a kind.

100
00:06:33,742 --> 00:06:35,142
I thought that was
an unusual color.

101
00:06:35,166 --> 00:06:36,833
Was that periwinkle?

102
00:06:36,916 --> 00:06:39,000
I did find this in the backseat.

103
00:06:39,083 --> 00:06:40,958
- Scraps!
- Precious, aren't they?

104
00:06:43,541 --> 00:06:46,625
- It smells like ass in here.
- Buckle up.

105
00:06:46,708 --> 00:06:49,416
This car certainly
isn't Triple A rated.

106
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:51,041
It's not even fit for animals.

107
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,083
I apologize

108
00:07:40,166 --> 00:07:43,916
for such an unexpected
late visit, Professor.

109
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,041
You're always welcome, Mr.
President.

110
00:07:47,125 --> 00:07:49,208
In your house with
soldiers, yes.

111
00:07:49,291 --> 00:07:51,666
In your classroom, I've
been told I'm less popular.

112
00:07:54,833 --> 00:07:59,708
Nothing is more important
than a good education.

113
00:08:08,625 --> 00:08:12,708
How's your English?

114
00:08:12,791 --> 00:08:15,833
I don't know much English, Mr.
President.

115
00:08:18,708 --> 00:08:21,916
"The only way for the
country to progress..."

116
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,875
is by eradicating the
scourge of genocide

117
00:08:26,958 --> 00:08:30,791
"blackening our country
and our livelihood."

118
00:08:33,625 --> 00:08:35,500
I appreciate your modesty.

119
00:08:38,208 --> 00:08:41,583
I hope we're not
disturbing your family.

120
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:47,166
They are on holiday.

121
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:48,583
Well, good for them.

122
00:08:50,666 --> 00:08:53,041
Family makes a man whole.

123
00:08:59,875 --> 00:09:01,833
I could have you
executed for treason...

124
00:09:01,916 --> 00:09:05,333
but another would simply
stand a little bit higher

125
00:09:05,416 --> 00:09:07,583
on your corpse.

126
00:09:07,666 --> 00:09:11,458
There must be some other
lesson I could teach you.

127
00:09:20,166 --> 00:09:21,333
As I said...

128
00:09:23,041 --> 00:09:27,500
there is nothing more important
than a good education.

129
00:09:33,291 --> 00:09:35,833
Professor Asimov, can you
please tell the court

130
00:09:35,916 --> 00:09:37,625
what happened next?

131
00:09:37,708 --> 00:09:40,666
Then I was taken...

132
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:43,416
to one of Dukhovich's
internment camps.

133
00:09:45,875 --> 00:09:49,416
I was there for three years...

134
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:52,958
until he was finally overthrown.

135
00:09:53,041 --> 00:09:57,041
Arrested for like
the monster he is.

136
00:09:59,041 --> 00:10:01,250
Thank you, Professor Asimov.

137
00:10:01,333 --> 00:10:04,041
Your Honor, I request that
this entire testimony

138
00:10:04,125 --> 00:10:05,750
be disregarded.

139
00:10:05,833 --> 00:10:09,708
Without any evidence,
this is merely hearsay.

140
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:11,416
Sustained.

141
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:13,083
The trial of former
Belarusian President

142
00:10:13,166 --> 00:10:14,208
Vladislav Dukhovich...

143
00:10:14,291 --> 00:10:16,333
continued today with
emotional testimony from

144
00:10:16,416 --> 00:10:18,250
many of his country's victims.

145
00:10:18,333 --> 00:10:19,583
But while powerful to hear,

146
00:10:19,666 --> 00:10:21,291
Dukhovich's attorneys say...

147
00:10:21,375 --> 00:10:23,750
they are nothing more than
the lies of his enemies.

148
00:10:23,833 --> 00:10:24,666
Long one of the world's

149
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:25,958
most brutal dictators...

150
00:10:26,041 --> 00:10:26,875
Who stands accused of

151
00:10:26,958 --> 00:10:28,833
ethnic cleansing on
a massive scale.

152
00:10:28,916 --> 00:10:31,041
An unprecedented level
of security is in place

153
00:10:31,125 --> 00:10:32,458
around the courthouse.

154
00:10:32,541 --> 00:10:34,500
Even the airspace above
this city is closed.

155
00:10:34,583 --> 00:10:35,583
So far, the prosecution

156
00:10:35,666 --> 00:10:37,083
has been crippled...

157
00:10:37,166 --> 00:10:39,486
by the lack of any hard evidence
against Dukhovich himself.

158
00:10:39,541 --> 00:10:40,375
Numerous witnesses

159
00:10:40,458 --> 00:10:43,166
who were expected to
testify have disappeared.

160
00:10:43,250 --> 00:10:44,666
Is there anyone brave enough

161
00:10:44,696 --> 00:10:45,976
to come forward with evidence...

162
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,708
and finally put an end
to his brutal reign?

163
00:11:06,208 --> 00:11:08,291
Mr. Kincaid, this is
Interpol's offer.

164
00:11:08,375 --> 00:11:09,833
In return for your testimony

165
00:11:09,916 --> 00:11:11,958
against former
President Dukhovich...

166
00:11:12,041 --> 00:11:13,958
your wife will receive
a full pardon

167
00:11:14,041 --> 00:11:15,208
from all jurisdictions.

168
00:11:17,125 --> 00:11:20,208
You're going to pardon
an innocent woman?

169
00:11:21,916 --> 00:11:23,750
That's mighty fucking
white of you.

170
00:11:23,833 --> 00:11:26,583
Assuming we accept
this arrangement

171
00:11:26,666 --> 00:11:27,916
for Sonia Kincaid,

172
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,708
there's still the
matter of an agreement

173
00:11:29,791 --> 00:11:30,791
regarding my client.

174
00:11:35,875 --> 00:11:37,958
He will receive...

175
00:11:38,041 --> 00:11:40,375
this letter...

176
00:11:40,458 --> 00:11:42,000
recommending leniency.

177
00:11:42,083 --> 00:11:43,833
Mr. Kincaid is a contract killer

178
00:11:43,916 --> 00:11:46,166
facing two dozen counts of
murder in 10 countries.

179
00:11:46,250 --> 00:11:48,125
Absent a legitimate deal,

180
00:11:48,208 --> 00:11:49,875
he will never breathe
free air again.

181
00:11:49,958 --> 00:11:51,041
Under no...

182
00:11:58,041 --> 00:12:00,583
Sonia goes free.

183
00:12:02,583 --> 00:12:05,083
We're all set, Director Casoria.

184
00:12:05,166 --> 00:12:06,958
Let's get this gentleman
to The Hague.

185
00:12:16,708 --> 00:12:19,500
Mr. Kincaid, this
is Agent Roussel.

186
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:21,083
She'll be leading
the security detail

187
00:12:21,166 --> 00:12:22,041
which will escort you

188
00:12:22,125 --> 00:12:25,125
to the International
Criminal Court.

189
00:12:25,208 --> 00:12:26,875
You know, Dukhovich's
men have killed

190
00:12:26,958 --> 00:12:29,000
every single witness
brought against them.

191
00:12:29,083 --> 00:12:32,458
And my security detail is
a dozen off-duty cops?

192
00:12:32,541 --> 00:12:34,416
These are the most
highly-trained officers

193
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:35,833
in Europe, Mr. Kincaid.

194
00:12:35,916 --> 00:12:37,416
We have taken every precaution

195
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:38,820
to make sure that
your involvement

196
00:12:38,844 --> 00:12:40,000
is completely classified.

197
00:12:40,083 --> 00:12:42,250
Oh, it's a secret?

198
00:12:42,333 --> 00:12:44,833
Oh, that makes me
feel so much better.

199
00:12:44,916 --> 00:12:48,333
Well, I can assure you, even
if there was an attempt...

200
00:12:48,416 --> 00:12:50,125
we're more than prepared
for any assault.

201
00:12:52,666 --> 00:12:54,958
Were you prepared for that
assault, motherfucker?

202
00:12:55,041 --> 00:12:56,875
Uncuff me, give
me some car keys,

203
00:12:56,958 --> 00:12:59,083
a couple guns, I'll
meet you guys there.

204
00:12:59,166 --> 00:13:00,000
The court's deadline

205
00:13:00,083 --> 00:13:02,625
is at 5:00 p.m. tomorrow, Mr.
Kincaid.

206
00:13:02,708 --> 00:13:04,291
That gives us 27 hours

207
00:13:04,375 --> 00:13:08,250
to transport you from
Manchester to the Netherlands.

208
00:13:08,333 --> 00:13:11,458
If you want to help your
wife, you should get moving.

209
00:13:14,583 --> 00:13:15,708
Okay, Inspector Clouseau,

210
00:13:15,791 --> 00:13:18,333
let's see what these elite
troops of yours can do.

211
00:13:18,416 --> 00:13:19,750
Come on, guys, let's go.

212
00:13:22,916 --> 00:13:25,500
Agent Roussel, I don't
have to remind you

213
00:13:25,583 --> 00:13:27,375
of the importance of this.

214
00:13:27,458 --> 00:13:28,541
No, ma'am.

215
00:13:28,625 --> 00:13:30,833
And don't doubt what
he's capable of.

216
00:13:30,916 --> 00:13:32,250
I won't, sir.

217
00:13:58,458 --> 00:14:00,000
Take a left on Kirkland Avenue.

218
00:14:00,083 --> 00:14:01,083
Yes, sir.

219
00:14:03,708 --> 00:14:05,458
What a pretty little town.

220
00:14:05,541 --> 00:14:07,208
Old narrow streets...

221
00:14:07,291 --> 00:14:09,625
buildings nice and close...

222
00:14:09,708 --> 00:14:12,166
lots of great views
from all those windows.

223
00:14:12,244 --> 00:14:13,684
This route's been
wiped clean for us.

224
00:14:13,708 --> 00:14:14,791
Nothing to worry about.

225
00:14:14,875 --> 00:14:16,791
Is that right?

226
00:14:16,875 --> 00:14:18,416
How's that nose of yours doing?

227
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:29,708
Take diversion route.

228
00:14:29,791 --> 00:14:31,041
Got a boyfriend, Roussie?

229
00:14:31,125 --> 00:14:32,500
Significant other?

230
00:14:32,583 --> 00:14:34,416
I need you to be quiet, Mr.
Kincaid.

231
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:36,500
I'm just saying, now might
be the perfect time

232
00:14:36,583 --> 00:14:38,875
to write one of those "I'll
always love you" texts.

233
00:14:43,958 --> 00:14:45,000
Relax, motherfucker.

234
00:14:45,083 --> 00:14:47,791
If you hear the shot, it
wasn't meant for you.

235
00:14:49,791 --> 00:14:52,041
221, 10-4 on route.

236
00:15:16,625 --> 00:15:18,500
Fuck!

237
00:15:18,583 --> 00:15:19,708
Move! Move!

238
00:15:30,166 --> 00:15:31,958
We've got more on the roof!

239
00:15:47,458 --> 00:15:48,458
Move! Move!

240
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:50,541
Rob, get that door open!

241
00:15:50,625 --> 00:15:51,791
Go! Go!

242
00:15:51,875 --> 00:15:53,958
Alpha Squad with me!

243
00:15:54,041 --> 00:15:55,666
Agent Roberts,
protect the witness!

244
00:16:01,666 --> 00:16:02,791
Parker, take the left flank!

245
00:16:15,291 --> 00:16:17,041
- Shit!
- We need more backup!

246
00:16:22,625 --> 00:16:23,625
Fuck!

247
00:16:44,583 --> 00:16:46,000
Agent Roussel!

248
00:16:46,083 --> 00:16:47,375
Goddammit, somebody!

249
00:16:47,458 --> 00:16:49,000
We need backup now!

250
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:56,666
Turn around!

251
00:17:09,458 --> 00:17:10,708
Lay down some cover fire.

252
00:17:34,541 --> 00:17:35,541
Oh!

253
00:17:40,791 --> 00:17:41,958
Fuck!

254
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:04,416
- Show me your hands!
- Bitch, please!

255
00:18:06,416 --> 00:18:07,958
- Put these on.
- Fuck that.

256
00:18:08,041 --> 00:18:09,833
Interpol's compromised.
You know that.

257
00:18:11,208 --> 00:18:13,750
Either you shoot me or
watch me bleed out.

258
00:18:20,666 --> 00:18:22,041
We gotta get off the street.

259
00:18:22,125 --> 00:18:23,645
There's a safe house
not far from here.

260
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:31,750
A car bomb has exploded
in Bishopsgate,

261
00:18:31,833 --> 00:18:33,000
near Coventry City Center.

262
00:18:37,291 --> 00:18:41,125
Don't even think about
answering that fucking phone!

263
00:18:41,208 --> 00:18:43,168
The only way Dukhovich
could've known our route...

264
00:18:43,192 --> 00:18:45,458
was if he had somebody
on the inside.

265
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:48,208
Now, I need medical supplies,
and you need help.

266
00:18:48,291 --> 00:18:49,958
So, if you're gonna
call somebody,

267
00:18:50,041 --> 00:18:52,583
they have to be totally
out of the loop.

268
00:18:56,083 --> 00:18:57,625
I've had the Black
Diamond service

269
00:18:57,708 --> 00:18:59,125
four times now, do
you understand?

270
00:18:59,208 --> 00:19:00,291
Four times.

271
00:19:00,375 --> 00:19:01,815
The car still smells
like a cemetery.

272
00:19:01,839 --> 00:19:05,166
Are you washing the car
with old assholes?

273
00:19:05,250 --> 00:19:08,916
Or... just help
me to understand.

274
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:13,916
Just a second here.

275
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,250
Hello, Amelia.

276
00:19:15,333 --> 00:19:17,375
I'm texting you an
address in Coventry.

277
00:19:17,458 --> 00:19:18,778
You need to get
there immediately.

278
00:19:18,802 --> 00:19:20,916
Bring three units of
O-Negative blood.

279
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,833
I'm doing very well, thank you.

280
00:19:22,916 --> 00:19:24,416
How are you?

281
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:26,250
I don't have the time
for this, Michael.

282
00:19:26,333 --> 00:19:27,708
I have a job I need you to do.

283
00:19:27,791 --> 00:19:29,208
Aah, pass.

284
00:19:29,291 --> 00:19:31,500
I wasn't offering.
I'm telling you.

285
00:19:31,583 --> 00:19:33,125
I have a job you're going to do.

286
00:19:33,208 --> 00:19:35,375
I'm not gonna let you charm
me into this one, Amelia.

287
00:19:35,458 --> 00:19:36,791
Okay, let's be clear.

288
00:19:36,875 --> 00:19:38,708
I'm not any happier about
this than you are,

289
00:19:38,791 --> 00:19:39,958
but I don't have a choice.

290
00:19:40,041 --> 00:19:42,625
- Well, thank God I do.
- No, Michael,

291
00:19:42,708 --> 00:19:43,958
you don't.

292
00:19:44,041 --> 00:19:45,801
Because if you're not
where I need you to be,

293
00:19:45,825 --> 00:19:48,125
I'm going to expose you and
your work to Interpol.

294
00:19:48,208 --> 00:19:51,125
That elite Triple A status
you want back so badly,

295
00:19:51,202 --> 00:19:52,642
I'll make sure you
never get near it.

296
00:19:52,666 --> 00:19:54,625
Oh, you're threatening me now?

297
00:19:54,708 --> 00:19:56,041
Not you, her.

298
00:19:56,125 --> 00:19:57,351
Are you threatening... you
can't just threaten me

299
00:19:57,375 --> 00:19:58,916
into taking orders from you.

300
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,517
I guess we'll find out.
You're three hours away.

301
00:20:00,541 --> 00:20:01,375
I'll see you in two and a half.

302
00:20:01,458 --> 00:20:03,125
Okay, okay. I guess we will.

303
00:20:03,208 --> 00:20:04,500
Jesus Christ.

304
00:20:04,583 --> 00:20:07,041
Here, we're gonna load all
these into the car, okay?

305
00:20:07,125 --> 00:20:08,765
We're gonna take the
car out in the front,

306
00:20:08,789 --> 00:20:10,109
and then we're just
gonna burn it.

307
00:20:11,166 --> 00:20:13,041
Ma'am, this place
is like a war zone.

308
00:20:13,125 --> 00:20:14,500
We got bodies everywhere.

309
00:20:14,583 --> 00:20:15,583
Our unit's compromised.

310
00:20:15,625 --> 00:20:16,833
Everyone's down.

311
00:20:16,916 --> 00:20:18,166
Get those guys ID'd.

312
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:20,125
And I've got no sign
of Agent Roussel.

313
00:20:20,208 --> 00:20:23,333
Maybe 15 to 20 dead
mercenaries, heavily armed.

314
00:20:23,416 --> 00:20:26,625
Media circus is in town, but
that's not the worst of it.

315
00:20:29,708 --> 00:20:30,916
Kincaid is gone.

316
00:20:32,666 --> 00:20:34,500
Coventry, every available agent.

317
00:20:34,583 --> 00:20:36,500
Report back to me
with any updates.

318
00:20:36,583 --> 00:20:37,583
Yes, ma'am.

319
00:20:40,375 --> 00:20:41,666
There must've been a leak.

320
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:43,208
I told you,

321
00:20:43,291 --> 00:20:44,833
there are too many
agencies involved.

322
00:20:44,916 --> 00:20:46,333
Get to The Hague.

323
00:20:46,416 --> 00:20:47,916
See what you can get
out of Dukhovich.

324
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,041
I'll try.

325
00:20:50,125 --> 00:20:52,083
And alert the penitentiary
in Amsterdam.

326
00:20:52,166 --> 00:20:54,291
Have them triple the guard
around Kincaid's wife.

327
00:20:54,375 --> 00:20:55,375
Got it.

328
00:21:19,416 --> 00:21:21,208
Mrs. Kincaid, your attorney.

329
00:21:39,375 --> 00:21:40,815
Did I tell you you
could turn around?

330
00:21:46,125 --> 00:21:47,845
What do you want, you
useless piece of shit?

331
00:21:47,869 --> 00:21:50,000
Oh, baby, baby, it's me.

332
00:21:50,083 --> 00:21:52,708
Oh, my bad.

333
00:21:52,791 --> 00:21:57,708
What do you want, you fucking
hijo de puta motherfucker!

334
00:21:57,791 --> 00:21:59,071
I just wanted to
hear your voice.

335
00:21:59,095 --> 00:22:00,708
Fuck you!

336
00:22:00,791 --> 00:22:02,625
There, you heard my voice.

337
00:22:02,708 --> 00:22:04,625
The only reason I'm
in this shit hole

338
00:22:04,708 --> 00:22:06,348
is so that they can get
to your sorry ass!

339
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,208
How you doing? You
made a shank yet?

340
00:22:10,291 --> 00:22:11,833
- What for?
- It's prison, baby.

341
00:22:11,916 --> 00:22:13,036
You got to protect yourself.

342
00:22:13,083 --> 00:22:15,625
It's a Dutch prison, Darius!

343
00:22:15,708 --> 00:22:17,625
What are they gonna do,
beat me with a clog?

344
00:22:17,708 --> 00:22:19,250
Oh, you got a view at least?

345
00:22:19,333 --> 00:22:22,916
Just a whole lot of
corny Dutch buildings.

346
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:26,916
There's one with a huge
fucking clock on it.

347
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,750
Like that's what I
need right now.

348
00:22:28,833 --> 00:22:30,833
Do they have those
flowers you love?

349
00:22:30,916 --> 00:22:32,666
Uh-mm! Irises?

350
00:22:32,750 --> 00:22:33,916
They come from there, right?

351
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,125
Fucking tulips, Darius.

352
00:22:36,208 --> 00:22:39,541
What kind of a piece
of shit husband

353
00:22:39,625 --> 00:22:42,000
doesn't remember his
wife's favorite flowers?

354
00:22:42,083 --> 00:22:43,916
You never remember anything.

355
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,416
What's our anniversary?

356
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:47,208
I'm gonna make this
up to you, baby.

357
00:22:47,291 --> 00:22:48,375
You see, that's what

358
00:22:48,458 --> 00:22:49,541
I'm talking about, cabrón.

359
00:22:51,625 --> 00:22:52,833
Darius, is something wrong?

360
00:22:54,708 --> 00:22:56,791
Not a thing, baby.

361
00:22:56,875 --> 00:22:59,541
Not a fucking thing.

362
00:23:02,166 --> 00:23:03,458
Then I wanna hear it.

363
00:23:07,333 --> 00:23:10,750
♪ 'Cause you know
Just what to say ♪

364
00:23:10,833 --> 00:23:14,166
♪ And you know Just what to do ♪

365
00:23:14,250 --> 00:23:18,500
♪ Let me start by
saying I love you ♪

366
00:23:25,291 --> 00:23:26,541
- Hello?
- Hello?

367
00:23:26,625 --> 00:23:29,958
- Sonia?
- Darius!

368
00:23:36,041 --> 00:23:38,125
You fucking shit!

369
00:24:06,625 --> 00:24:08,416
Go ahead, you might as
well finish the job.

370
00:24:20,750 --> 00:24:24,958
- Why am I here, Amelia?
- A high value transport.

371
00:24:25,041 --> 00:24:26,750
Oh, high value?

372
00:24:26,833 --> 00:24:28,916
Oh! I don't...

373
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,750
I don't really do
high value anymore.

374
00:24:30,833 --> 00:24:33,291
I mean, these days, I'm
more in the mid-level

375
00:24:33,375 --> 00:24:35,416
coked-out attorney market.

376
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:36,500
Why do you think that is?

377
00:24:36,583 --> 00:24:38,041
Seriously, Michael?

378
00:24:38,125 --> 00:24:39,166
Because of you.

379
00:24:39,250 --> 00:24:41,083
You used me to climb
the Interpol ladder,

380
00:24:41,166 --> 00:24:42,375
and here we are again.

381
00:24:42,458 --> 00:24:43,500
Whoo!

382
00:24:45,458 --> 00:24:46,666
You up for a promotion?

383
00:24:46,750 --> 00:24:48,208
You have to blame me

384
00:24:48,291 --> 00:24:49,476
for every little bump in
your road, don't you?

385
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:51,708
No, these aren't bumps.
No, no, no bumps.

386
00:24:51,791 --> 00:24:54,583
Just one dead
Japanese arms dealer.

387
00:24:54,666 --> 00:24:56,125
Which I had nothing to do with.

388
00:24:56,208 --> 00:24:57,583
Do you know what happens...

389
00:24:57,666 --> 00:24:59,833
when a Triple A rated
executive protection agent

390
00:24:59,916 --> 00:25:01,250
loses a client?

391
00:25:01,333 --> 00:25:02,416
Triple A.

392
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:04,291
I was up here, yeah?

393
00:25:04,332 --> 00:25:05,892
Then I opened up to
you, why wouldn't I,

394
00:25:05,916 --> 00:25:07,375
I was in love with you.

395
00:25:07,458 --> 00:25:09,750
And I fucking told you his name.

396
00:25:09,833 --> 00:25:11,473
It was the first time
in my entire career,

397
00:25:11,497 --> 00:25:12,916
I revealed a client's name.

398
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,166
I trusted you.

399
00:25:14,250 --> 00:25:16,666
Ba-ba-ba-ba... bump!

400
00:25:16,750 --> 00:25:18,291
Now I'm down here.

401
00:25:18,375 --> 00:25:19,916
The dead guy's up here.

402
00:25:22,041 --> 00:25:24,041
I'm sorry, Michael, you
hit a rough patch.

403
00:25:24,125 --> 00:25:25,416
A rough patch...

404
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:28,333
A 300-pound investment
banker's ass

405
00:25:28,416 --> 00:25:29,625
exploded four bags of heroin

406
00:25:29,708 --> 00:25:31,108
in the backseat of
my car last week.

407
00:25:31,166 --> 00:25:32,958
Those aren't leather
seats, those are cloth.

408
00:25:33,041 --> 00:25:34,958
- Okay, Michael...
- Take a minute

409
00:25:35,041 --> 00:25:36,559
- to grab a mental image...
- I don't have the time

410
00:25:36,583 --> 00:25:38,625
- to hear your insane shit!
- At a certain point,

411
00:25:38,708 --> 00:25:39,625
- you just sell the car.
- I never betrayed you.

412
00:25:39,708 --> 00:25:40,958
I never used you!

413
00:25:41,041 --> 00:25:42,125
I just left you!

414
00:25:46,541 --> 00:25:49,875
Because you couldn't forgive me
for something I didn't even do.

415
00:25:57,791 --> 00:25:59,541
- Transport...
- Transport is in there.

416
00:26:03,333 --> 00:26:05,833
Is that blood dude...

417
00:26:05,916 --> 00:26:07,791
What the fuck?

418
00:26:25,416 --> 00:26:27,296
Do you know how long I've
been waiting for this?

419
00:26:29,833 --> 00:26:31,291
No, no, no. I'm not gonna look.

420
00:26:32,625 --> 00:26:34,083
Oh! Motherfucker!

421
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,291
Hey, hey, hey, whoa, whoa, whoa.

422
00:26:44,375 --> 00:26:45,495
Let's talk about this, okay?

423
00:26:45,519 --> 00:26:46,791
Even a dumbass like you

424
00:26:46,875 --> 00:26:50,041
is smart enough to
keep one in the pipe.

425
00:26:51,458 --> 00:26:52,541
Oh, shit.

426
00:26:53,375 --> 00:26:55,666
And nighty night.

427
00:26:55,750 --> 00:26:58,250
Darius Kincaid. Jesus Christ!

428
00:26:58,333 --> 00:26:59,693
This is who you
want me to protect?

429
00:26:59,717 --> 00:27:00,750
Look at my shirt!

430
00:27:00,833 --> 00:27:01,833
Shut up for two seconds!

431
00:27:01,916 --> 00:27:03,416
Fine, fine.

432
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:05,458
You get the feet, I'll
get the nostrils.

433
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,875
The trial of former
Belarusian President

434
00:27:08,958 --> 00:27:10,458
Vladislav Dukhovich...

435
00:27:10,541 --> 00:27:12,166
took an uncertain
turn this week,

436
00:27:12,250 --> 00:27:13,916
having recently survived

437
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:17,666
a dioxin poisoning attempt
that left his face disfigured.

438
00:27:17,750 --> 00:27:19,150
Authorities are
keeping Dukhovich...

439
00:27:19,174 --> 00:27:21,333
Interpol wishes to have a word.

440
00:27:21,416 --> 00:27:24,083
Quite the dust-up in
Coventry this morning.

441
00:27:24,166 --> 00:27:26,246
But you wouldn't know anything
about that, would you?

442
00:27:29,166 --> 00:27:31,416
You've come here to
lodge a complaint?

443
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:32,791
I've come for my money.

444
00:27:32,875 --> 00:27:34,791
I delivered as promised.

445
00:27:34,875 --> 00:27:38,041
I gave you Kincaid as exposed
as you'll ever get him.

446
00:27:38,125 --> 00:27:39,541
Small security detail,

447
00:27:39,625 --> 00:27:41,458
practically a rookie
leading them.

448
00:27:41,541 --> 00:27:43,458
I can't do more than that.

449
00:27:43,541 --> 00:27:44,708
Let's be fair here.

450
00:27:54,833 --> 00:27:58,500
You think it's fair to want
something for nothing?

451
00:27:58,583 --> 00:27:59,708
In my country...

452
00:28:01,750 --> 00:28:04,333
we would skin you like a cat.

453
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:06,541
Would that be fair?

454
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,791
I come from nothing.

455
00:28:10,875 --> 00:28:13,458
I work all my life...

456
00:28:13,541 --> 00:28:15,833
serving the people.

457
00:28:15,916 --> 00:28:18,416
And then, they come
into my country

458
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:19,916
and they took it all away!

459
00:28:21,708 --> 00:28:24,750
And now, they lock
me up like a rat...

460
00:28:24,833 --> 00:28:27,083
feed me poison!

461
00:28:28,541 --> 00:28:29,541
Is this fair?

462
00:28:30,750 --> 00:28:32,791
When Kincaid is dead...

463
00:28:35,916 --> 00:28:37,500
you'll be paid in full.

464
00:28:40,501 --> 00:28:41,781
You know he's a murderer, right?

465
00:28:41,805 --> 00:28:43,250
You're playing nurse
to a murderer.

466
00:28:43,333 --> 00:28:44,166
- A witness.
- Really?

467
00:28:44,250 --> 00:28:47,500
- Hmm-hmm.
- 27 times.

468
00:28:47,583 --> 00:28:49,703
That's how many times this
asshole's tried to kill me.

469
00:28:49,727 --> 00:28:50,208
27... 28!

470
00:28:50,291 --> 00:28:52,375
Fucking Prague!

471
00:28:52,458 --> 00:28:54,083
If Dukhovich is acquitted,

472
00:28:54,166 --> 00:28:55,541
he'll be back in
power next week.

473
00:28:55,625 --> 00:28:58,458
- I won't let that happen.
- Good.

474
00:28:58,541 --> 00:28:59,916
You should take
him to The Hague.

475
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,000
I can't!

476
00:29:01,041 --> 00:29:02,666
There's a mole inside Interpol.

477
00:29:02,750 --> 00:29:04,291
It's already cost me
12 good officers.

478
00:29:04,375 --> 00:29:05,625
Good?

479
00:29:05,708 --> 00:29:06,916
That's subjective, you know.

480
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,750
Nice. Maybe they were nice.

481
00:29:09,793 --> 00:29:10,913
I'll make it simple for you.

482
00:29:10,937 --> 00:29:13,000
If I stay near him,
they'll find him.

483
00:29:13,083 --> 00:29:14,125
So I gotta risk my life

484
00:29:14,208 --> 00:29:15,791
protecting this coffin
magnet over here?

485
00:29:15,875 --> 00:29:17,101
No, no, no, no! You
gotta put something

486
00:29:17,125 --> 00:29:18,434
- in the pot for me, okay?
- How about your career?

487
00:29:18,458 --> 00:29:20,291
- How about it?
- Your precious career.

488
00:29:20,375 --> 00:29:21,916
You do this job for me...

489
00:29:23,250 --> 00:29:25,916
and I'll get you back
to elite status.

490
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,916
Yeah, you don't have that power.

491
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,541
I've got connections.

492
00:29:30,625 --> 00:29:32,625
You want back in the big
game, I can put you there.

493
00:29:32,649 --> 00:29:33,691
Why would I trust you?

494
00:29:35,625 --> 00:29:36,708
Why?

495
00:29:39,166 --> 00:29:40,791
Because I've never
lied to you, Michael.

496
00:29:43,125 --> 00:29:47,083
You're terrible at
almost everything...

497
00:29:47,166 --> 00:29:49,583
but you're good at
keeping people alive.

498
00:29:49,666 --> 00:29:53,375
Keep him alive, please...

499
00:29:53,458 --> 00:29:56,291
and you get your
dream life back.

500
00:29:56,375 --> 00:29:58,916
And as a bonus, you'll
never hear from me again.

501
00:30:02,791 --> 00:30:04,000
Good.

502
00:30:06,333 --> 00:30:08,916
- That's bad.
- I don't speak French.

503
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,750
Still.

504
00:30:10,833 --> 00:30:11,875
Shame.

505
00:30:17,958 --> 00:30:18,958
Shit!

506
00:30:20,750 --> 00:30:22,375
Where are you?

507
00:30:22,458 --> 00:30:24,538
Setting up operation at
Coventry police headquarters.

508
00:30:24,562 --> 00:30:25,802
You got nothing from Dukhovich?

509
00:30:25,826 --> 00:30:26,916
Are you surprised?

510
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,041
- Ma'am?
- Busy.

511
00:30:28,125 --> 00:30:29,517
Yes, ma'am, but I've
picked up activity

512
00:30:29,541 --> 00:30:30,581
at our safe house in town.

513
00:30:30,625 --> 00:30:31,851
Is this something I
need to know right now?

514
00:30:31,875 --> 00:30:33,715
No, not normally. But
yes, it should be vacant.

515
00:30:33,739 --> 00:30:34,791
And you believe it's not?

516
00:30:34,875 --> 00:30:36,500
Well, the access
code was activated

517
00:30:36,583 --> 00:30:38,166
without identity authorization.

518
00:30:38,250 --> 00:30:40,000
Could Kincaid have
gotten inside?

519
00:30:40,083 --> 00:30:41,500
But it's on a
revolving encryption.

520
00:30:43,333 --> 00:30:44,750
Get a team over there. Now!

521
00:30:46,125 --> 00:30:48,041
And where is Agent Roussel?

522
00:30:48,125 --> 00:30:50,041
- Sorry, got to go.
- Good luck.

523
00:30:58,041 --> 00:30:59,958
I believe I know
where Kincaid is.

524
00:31:06,727 --> 00:31:07,767
I know this Darius Kincaid

525
00:31:07,791 --> 00:31:08,708
we're talking about.

526
00:31:08,791 --> 00:31:11,583
I want proof he's dead.

527
00:31:11,666 --> 00:31:13,375
Proof? Like a photo?

528
00:31:14,458 --> 00:31:15,875
Like a head.

529
00:31:29,208 --> 00:31:31,791
- What the fuck is all this?
- You're a fugitive.

530
00:31:31,875 --> 00:31:34,541
- Fugitives wear restraints.
- No, no, no, not the cuffs.

531
00:31:34,625 --> 00:31:36,083
I'm talking about
these whack ass

532
00:31:36,166 --> 00:31:37,583
hipster clothes I'm wearing.

533
00:31:37,666 --> 00:31:40,666
- Yeah, luckily I brought extra.
- Lucky for who?

534
00:31:40,750 --> 00:31:43,625
Ah, shit. Am I
wearing underwear?

535
00:31:43,708 --> 00:31:45,000
Those are for me too,

536
00:31:45,083 --> 00:31:46,723
in case I have to change
your pants again.

537
00:31:46,747 --> 00:31:48,083
Not a fan.

538
00:31:48,166 --> 00:31:50,375
You know they call them
swinging dicks for a reason.

539
00:31:50,458 --> 00:31:52,250
How about we never
speak of this again.

540
00:31:56,750 --> 00:31:58,541
Shit.

541
00:31:58,625 --> 00:32:00,375
Interpol protocol.

542
00:32:00,458 --> 00:32:02,125
When that phone rings
and nobody answers,

543
00:32:02,208 --> 00:32:05,291
they're gonna send
officers to the door.

544
00:32:05,375 --> 00:32:06,583
And there they are.

545
00:32:08,416 --> 00:32:09,916
Yes, we're setting
our perimeter.

546
00:32:11,875 --> 00:32:13,416
Comfy?

547
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:15,375
So, what happened to
little Miss Interpol?

548
00:32:15,458 --> 00:32:17,791
- Agent Roussel's gone.
- Oh damn!

549
00:32:17,875 --> 00:32:20,583
I liked her. She's spunky.

550
00:32:20,666 --> 00:32:22,625
This building has two
stairwells, no fire...

551
00:32:22,708 --> 00:32:24,791
Escapes and no
adjacent rooftops.

552
00:32:24,875 --> 00:32:26,351
You know, you're not the
only observant motherfucker

553
00:32:26,375 --> 00:32:27,416
on the planet.

554
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:28,500
I go through doors first.

555
00:32:28,551 --> 00:32:30,351
I check to see if it's
clear, then you follow.

556
00:32:30,375 --> 00:32:32,250
Really? You think
that's necessary?

557
00:32:32,333 --> 00:32:34,458
My job is to keep you
out of harm's way.

558
00:32:34,541 --> 00:32:36,875
Shit, motherfucker.

559
00:32:36,958 --> 00:32:39,250
I am harm's way.

560
00:32:40,625 --> 00:32:42,625
Split up and take
different floors.

561
00:32:42,708 --> 00:32:44,250
Split up and take
different floors.

562
00:32:53,916 --> 00:32:55,875
Two hostiles, maybe more.

563
00:32:55,958 --> 00:32:57,375
I don't suppose I
could have a gun?

564
00:32:57,458 --> 00:32:59,058
No. We're gonna take
the north stairwell.

565
00:32:59,082 --> 00:33:00,000
Let's go.

566
00:33:00,083 --> 00:33:01,083
No! You fuck!

567
00:33:17,625 --> 00:33:19,291
Oh! Thank God, you're here.

568
00:33:19,375 --> 00:33:21,416
I don't know what I
would've done without you.

569
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:23,625
Well done. Guess
what happens now?

570
00:33:23,708 --> 00:33:25,375
Shots fired! Shots fired!

571
00:33:40,083 --> 00:33:41,791
All units send in a 9-9.

572
00:33:46,333 --> 00:33:48,708
Now we have a new problem.

573
00:33:48,791 --> 00:33:51,291
I like to keep things
a little more subtle.

574
00:33:51,375 --> 00:33:53,000
Quick, they're heading
for the roof.

575
00:34:01,375 --> 00:34:03,375
See, boring is better.

576
00:34:07,541 --> 00:34:08,666
Okay.

577
00:34:08,750 --> 00:34:10,750
That's very loud.

578
00:34:10,833 --> 00:34:11,916
It was empty anyway.

579
00:34:16,666 --> 00:34:18,708
We have two heat
signatures on the rooftop

580
00:34:18,791 --> 00:34:20,416
moving in a
northbound direction.

581
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:22,291
Copy that! Go, go, go!
They're on the roof!

582
00:34:24,875 --> 00:34:26,500
No, no, no. No
odds in that jump.

583
00:34:26,583 --> 00:34:28,183
Well, it beats the
hell out of whatever's

584
00:34:28,207 --> 00:34:29,367
gonna come through that door.

585
00:34:29,391 --> 00:34:31,791
No. Just gotta...

586
00:34:31,875 --> 00:34:34,333
We just gotta find a
more intelligent way...

587
00:34:35,458 --> 00:34:39,208
Oh! Motherfucker!

588
00:34:39,291 --> 00:34:41,666
Shit!

589
00:34:41,750 --> 00:34:43,458
Holy fucking shit.

590
00:34:43,541 --> 00:34:45,125
Secure the roof! Go, go, go!

591
00:34:45,208 --> 00:34:47,208
Delta squad with me!

592
00:34:47,269 --> 00:34:48,309
They're on the north side!

593
00:34:48,333 --> 00:34:49,416
Copy that!

594
00:34:56,625 --> 00:34:58,500
Made that jump on one leg.

595
00:34:58,583 --> 00:35:00,208
I made that jump
without jumping.

596
00:35:00,291 --> 00:35:01,500
Let's go.

597
00:35:01,583 --> 00:35:02,833
So, what's your next trick,

598
00:35:02,916 --> 00:35:04,958
showing me how we escape
without escaping?

599
00:35:05,001 --> 00:35:06,281
Let's just try to get to the car

600
00:35:06,305 --> 00:35:07,625
without killing
anyone, all right?

601
00:35:09,166 --> 00:35:11,125
- Is this your car?
- One of them.

602
00:35:11,208 --> 00:35:12,728
I remember shooting
at you in a Jaguar.

603
00:35:12,791 --> 00:35:14,750
Buckle up. If we get
in a high-speed chase,

604
00:35:14,833 --> 00:35:16,000
I want you strapped in.

605
00:35:16,083 --> 00:35:17,363
I'm more worried
about the wheels

606
00:35:17,387 --> 00:35:19,554
coming off this bitch when
you reach the speed limit.

607
00:35:21,041 --> 00:35:22,291
You know, back in the day,

608
00:35:22,349 --> 00:35:24,309
we wouldn't have even stolen
this piece of shit...

609
00:35:24,333 --> 00:35:25,750
and we stole everything.

610
00:35:25,833 --> 00:35:26,833
I remember one night...

611
00:35:26,916 --> 00:35:27,833
I know all I need
to know about you.

612
00:35:27,916 --> 00:35:29,208
All your early arrests...

613
00:35:29,291 --> 00:35:30,625
your father in and
out of prison,

614
00:35:30,708 --> 00:35:32,875
you following in the
same footsteps.

615
00:35:32,958 --> 00:35:34,541
Did your little
research, did you?

616
00:35:34,625 --> 00:35:36,750
Well, prepare for a test,
so there are no surprises.

617
00:35:36,833 --> 00:35:39,916
Hmm, and you grew up
wanting to be a cop...

618
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,120
till you found out there
wasn't no money in that shit.

619
00:35:42,144 --> 00:35:44,541
So you joined the CIA,
sharpened your skills...

620
00:35:44,625 --> 00:35:46,458
then decided to
open your own shop,

621
00:35:46,541 --> 00:35:48,625
pimp yourself out
to the fat cats.

622
00:35:48,708 --> 00:35:51,791
I didn't even have to do no
research to know that shit.

623
00:35:51,875 --> 00:35:54,208
It's written all
over your punk ass.

624
00:35:54,291 --> 00:35:56,125
Can't wait to hear
what I'll do next.

625
00:35:56,208 --> 00:35:58,041
That's great.

626
00:35:58,125 --> 00:36:00,458
You know, why don't...

627
00:36:00,541 --> 00:36:01,750
Why don't you lay back

628
00:36:01,833 --> 00:36:03,193
and keep from getting
spotted, huh?

629
00:36:03,217 --> 00:36:04,884
Get comfortable.
That's a good idea.

630
00:36:08,791 --> 00:36:09,875
Ooh-hoo!

631
00:36:09,958 --> 00:36:12,708
Smells like ass back here!

632
00:36:12,791 --> 00:36:15,666
Bet that Jag never
smelled like ass.

633
00:36:15,750 --> 00:36:18,000
Oh! These your electrolytes?

634
00:36:41,125 --> 00:36:43,416
Darius has gone.

635
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:45,041
Nothing but cops out here.

636
00:36:47,083 --> 00:36:49,125
Facial recognition
identifies this man

637
00:36:49,208 --> 00:36:51,458
as Michael Bryce.

638
00:36:51,541 --> 00:36:54,458
But you already know that,
don't you, Agent Roussel?

639
00:36:54,541 --> 00:36:58,208
- You two have a history.
- Long time ago.

640
00:36:58,291 --> 00:37:00,125
You slipped Kincaid
into our own safe house

641
00:37:00,208 --> 00:37:02,208
then brought in this...

642
00:37:02,291 --> 00:37:04,208
Executive protection agent?

643
00:37:08,333 --> 00:37:09,853
Official channels had
been compromised.

644
00:37:09,916 --> 00:37:11,076
What did you expect me to do?

645
00:37:11,100 --> 00:37:13,750
Clearly, our office
security's been breached.

646
00:37:13,833 --> 00:37:15,916
The red notice stays.

647
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,833
You, however, can go. I'm
placing you on leave.

648
00:37:18,916 --> 00:37:21,875
You will surrender your
weapon and credentials.

649
00:37:21,958 --> 00:37:25,875
You are going to be telling
this story for years, Amelia...

650
00:37:25,958 --> 00:37:27,916
from inside a very
large office...

651
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
or a very small cell.

652
00:37:30,083 --> 00:37:34,333
Well, I like my odds.

653
00:37:34,416 --> 00:37:37,166
The only way Bryce and Kincaid
don't make it to The Hague...

654
00:37:37,250 --> 00:37:38,530
is if they kill
each other first.

655
00:37:40,250 --> 00:37:43,041
Amelia.

656
00:37:43,125 --> 00:37:47,083
- She's making a mistake.
- We need to plug our leak.

657
00:37:47,166 --> 00:37:49,958
Now, this Bryce,
do you trust him?

658
00:37:50,041 --> 00:37:53,041
With something like this, yes.

659
00:37:53,166 --> 00:37:54,708
I'll speak to Casoria,

660
00:37:54,791 --> 00:37:57,416
get her to allow you to
come to The Hague with us.

661
00:37:57,500 --> 00:38:00,250
But no more secrets.

662
00:38:00,333 --> 00:38:01,333
Thank you, sir.

663
00:38:09,375 --> 00:38:14,041
Search for car, plate FJ56MHV.

664
00:38:14,125 --> 00:38:16,250
They'll have identified the car

665
00:38:16,333 --> 00:38:17,493
with the traffic cams by now.

666
00:38:17,541 --> 00:38:19,916
And you. Welcome
to fugitive life.

667
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,708
Until I turn you in.

668
00:38:21,791 --> 00:38:23,958
Just need to find a
different vehicle...

669
00:38:24,041 --> 00:38:26,250
older model, no alarm.

670
00:38:26,333 --> 00:38:27,416
Right here.

671
00:38:28,666 --> 00:38:30,375
Luckily, I came prepared.

672
00:38:33,333 --> 00:38:34,773
You know, if you're
gonna be a while,

673
00:38:34,797 --> 00:38:36,583
I can just go in there
and get a room.

674
00:38:36,666 --> 00:38:38,708
There's an art to low
impact, high efficiency

675
00:38:38,791 --> 00:38:41,208
breaking and entering, but...

676
00:38:45,333 --> 00:38:49,125
- Art's objective.
- And you're bleeding again.

677
00:38:49,208 --> 00:38:51,288
You know, for a dude that
runs around killing people,

678
00:38:51,312 --> 00:38:53,352
you've got this really strange
thing about bleeding.

679
00:38:53,376 --> 00:38:54,125
It's inefficient.

680
00:38:54,208 --> 00:38:56,250
And I don't kill people,
I protect them.

681
00:38:56,333 --> 00:38:57,791
Hector Ramirez.

682
00:38:59,416 --> 00:39:01,333
Hector Ramirez was an assassin.

683
00:39:01,416 --> 00:39:02,875
Yeah, I know. I trained him.

684
00:39:02,926 --> 00:39:04,726
Who was holding a knife
to my client's throat.

685
00:39:04,750 --> 00:39:05,958
And you killed him.

686
00:39:06,041 --> 00:39:08,750
No. I saved my client.

687
00:39:08,833 --> 00:39:11,114
I think Hector might have a
different perspective on that.

688
00:39:11,138 --> 00:39:11,958
Oh, is that so?

689
00:39:12,041 --> 00:39:13,291
Well, here's the thing.

690
00:39:13,375 --> 00:39:15,335
I was a Triple A rated
executive protection agent.

691
00:39:15,359 --> 00:39:16,919
You just made up that
Triple A bullshit.

692
00:39:16,943 --> 00:39:17,625
No, I did not!

693
00:39:17,708 --> 00:39:19,791
And if guys like you,
sociopaths like you

694
00:39:19,875 --> 00:39:21,476
weren't running around
trying to kill my clients,

695
00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:22,333
then no one would get hurt.

696
00:39:22,416 --> 00:39:23,809
Triple A, yeah, it sounds
like you ought to be

697
00:39:23,833 --> 00:39:25,041
selling life insurance

698
00:39:25,125 --> 00:39:26,476
or fixing my fucking
transmission, or something.

699
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:27,958
Well, you're
uninsurable, trust me.

700
00:39:28,041 --> 00:39:29,208
And you said "was".

701
00:39:29,286 --> 00:39:30,726
"I was a Triple A,
x-rated dickhead!"

702
00:39:30,750 --> 00:39:31,750
Get in the fucking car!

703
00:39:31,791 --> 00:39:33,208
Get in the fucking car!

704
00:39:37,125 --> 00:39:39,625
Jesus fucking Christ.

705
00:39:39,708 --> 00:39:42,166
You definitely said "was".

706
00:39:42,250 --> 00:39:46,041
"Was" as in, "I used to
be a Triple X dickhead

707
00:39:46,125 --> 00:39:47,291
driving a Jag...

708
00:39:47,342 --> 00:39:49,182
"but now I'm rolling
around in this shitwagon."

709
00:39:49,206 --> 00:39:50,375
Put your seatbelt on.

710
00:39:50,458 --> 00:39:53,125
What happened? Lose your edge?

711
00:39:53,208 --> 00:39:55,166
Drop focus?

712
00:39:55,250 --> 00:39:57,458
You slip up and let a
client get popped?

713
00:39:57,541 --> 00:39:59,166
Never slipped up.

714
00:39:59,250 --> 00:40:03,333
Well, how did "am" become "was"?

715
00:40:03,416 --> 00:40:04,833
I don't... I don't
actually know.

716
00:40:04,916 --> 00:40:07,083
I mean, how does the
so-called expert assassin

717
00:40:07,166 --> 00:40:09,916
get busted by Interpol?

718
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,916
Love, baby. Straight up love.

719
00:40:13,458 --> 00:40:16,125
See, I'm doing this
job in Geneva, right?

720
00:40:16,208 --> 00:40:17,916
Some dude washing the
wrong dude's money.

721
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,291
I get a call.

722
00:40:19,375 --> 00:40:20,541
What?

723
00:40:20,625 --> 00:40:22,345
My wife's been in a car accident.
A bad one.

724
00:40:22,375 --> 00:40:23,625
What?

725
00:40:23,708 --> 00:40:26,250
So, Geneva dude gets a pass,
I jet back to Mexico City...

726
00:40:26,333 --> 00:40:27,666
go straight to the hospital.

727
00:40:27,750 --> 00:40:29,125
Bopped up in Sonia's room...

728
00:40:29,208 --> 00:40:31,166
two dozen agents waiting for me.

729
00:40:37,291 --> 00:40:39,208
Played by the heart.

730
00:40:39,291 --> 00:40:41,000
Happens to the best of us, man.

731
00:40:41,083 --> 00:40:43,250
I mean, sort of like how
Agent Roussel took you

732
00:40:43,333 --> 00:40:46,500
from here... to here to here.

733
00:40:46,583 --> 00:40:48,416
Oh, assassin and eavesdropper.

734
00:40:48,500 --> 00:40:50,666
That's a real... You're
a real double threat.

735
00:40:50,750 --> 00:40:52,666
Well, you were whining
like a bitch so loud,

736
00:40:52,750 --> 00:40:54,000
I heard you through the wall.

737
00:40:54,083 --> 00:40:55,923
Agent Roussel and I aren't
any of your concern.

738
00:40:55,947 --> 00:40:58,583
So, she dumped you because
of all your tight-assed...

739
00:40:58,666 --> 00:41:00,666
boring is good, look
before you leap,

740
00:41:00,750 --> 00:41:01,958
put your seatbelt on shit?

741
00:41:02,041 --> 00:41:03,166
She didn't dump me.

742
00:41:03,250 --> 00:41:05,750
Oh, motherfucker, I
know she dumped you.

743
00:41:05,833 --> 00:41:08,041
I'm just perusing all
the reasons why...

744
00:41:08,125 --> 00:41:10,666
and there's a plethora
of those motherfuckers.

745
00:41:10,750 --> 00:41:12,666
- Plethora?
- Yeah. It means a lot.

746
00:41:12,750 --> 00:41:14,166
I know what plethora means!

747
00:41:14,250 --> 00:41:16,708
It just doesn't apply here!

748
00:41:16,787 --> 00:41:18,267
And not jumping off
the top of a roof,

749
00:41:18,291 --> 00:41:20,000
that's logical, that's safe.

750
00:41:20,083 --> 00:41:23,791
You know, wearing a
seatbelt, logical, safe.

751
00:41:23,875 --> 00:41:24,875
Let me ask you something,

752
00:41:24,916 --> 00:41:26,791
how many times have
you been shot?

753
00:41:26,875 --> 00:41:28,541
- Counting today?
- Yeah.

754
00:41:28,625 --> 00:41:30,791
Ooh! Too many to count. You?

755
00:41:30,875 --> 00:41:32,083
Zero.

756
00:41:32,166 --> 00:41:33,486
Now, we both know
that's bullshit.

757
00:41:33,510 --> 00:41:34,958
That's not bullshit, okay?

758
00:41:35,041 --> 00:41:36,875
This was a little flesh wound.

759
00:41:36,958 --> 00:41:38,583
You just kind of
zinged it right there.

760
00:41:38,666 --> 00:41:40,466
Didn't even require a Band-Aid.
You got lucky.

761
00:41:40,490 --> 00:41:43,625
Yeah, the rock shifted
just as I took the shot.

762
00:41:43,708 --> 00:41:45,458
You're a lucky motherfucker.
Fuck!

763
00:41:45,541 --> 00:41:46,875
Fuck!

764
00:41:46,958 --> 00:41:48,916
Fucking Prague.

765
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:50,000
Yeah, Prague.

766
00:41:50,083 --> 00:41:51,666
You never even took
one for a client?

767
00:41:51,750 --> 00:41:53,125
Nope. Never had to.

768
00:41:53,208 --> 00:41:54,916
Yeah, but the question
is, would you?

769
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:56,625
See, if I'm paying
Triple A rates,

770
00:41:56,708 --> 00:41:59,291
then I'm looking for
that full-service shit,

771
00:41:59,375 --> 00:42:00,375
you know what I'm saying?

772
00:42:00,458 --> 00:42:03,500
That extra A stands
for Ass, yours,

773
00:42:03,583 --> 00:42:05,041
between mine and a bullet.

774
00:42:05,125 --> 00:42:07,083
Being prepared for everything...

775
00:42:07,166 --> 00:42:08,642
- means that that situation...
- Bryce, you cannot

776
00:42:08,666 --> 00:42:11,146
- be prepared for everything!
- Statistically just won't occur.

777
00:42:11,170 --> 00:42:13,166
You know, life is gonna
bloody us up, okay?

778
00:42:13,250 --> 00:42:15,916
You just gotta put a Band-Aid
on that shit and keep rolling!

779
00:42:17,166 --> 00:42:18,625
That's really beautiful, man.

780
00:42:18,708 --> 00:42:20,428
Do you ever just write
stuff down, you know?

781
00:42:20,452 --> 00:42:22,292
Maybe, I don't know, throw
down a haiku or two?

How'd you like that,
motherfucker?

799
00:43:36,125 --> 00:43:38,125
Do you have any idea
how stupid you sound?

800
00:43:38,208 --> 00:43:40,291
I mean, what a fuck up!

801
00:43:40,375 --> 00:43:42,875
You lost my husband,
and you're like,

802
00:43:42,958 --> 00:43:45,291
"Can you please
help us find him?"

803
00:43:45,375 --> 00:43:47,291
Why the fuck should I?

804
00:43:47,375 --> 00:43:50,041
That is your fucking
job, motherfucker!

805
00:43:50,125 --> 00:43:52,416
But, obviously, you suck at it.

806
00:43:56,250 --> 00:43:57,791
You received a phone call today

807
00:43:57,875 --> 00:43:58,750
from your attorney.

808
00:43:58,833 --> 00:44:00,458
So?

809
00:44:00,541 --> 00:44:02,708
Well, we asked your attorney

810
00:44:02,791 --> 00:44:05,583
but, he said he didn't
have any contact with you.

811
00:44:05,666 --> 00:44:09,625
What? Are you
fucking kidding me?

812
00:44:09,708 --> 00:44:12,333
Okay, that's it! I've had
it with this lawyer!

813
00:44:12,416 --> 00:44:13,791
He's an alcoholic.

814
00:44:13,875 --> 00:44:16,000
He calls me completely drunk...

815
00:44:16,083 --> 00:44:18,958
and he starts saying the
most inappropriate things.

816
00:44:19,041 --> 00:44:20,250
Like, for example,

817
00:44:20,333 --> 00:44:22,958
what he likes to do
to his wife's ass?

818
00:44:23,041 --> 00:44:26,875
That is a disgusting place
to hide a child's toy!

819
00:44:26,958 --> 00:44:28,041
And you know what?

820
00:44:28,125 --> 00:44:30,041
I don't need to
listen to this shit!

821
00:44:30,125 --> 00:44:31,708
Then he forgets about it,

822
00:44:31,791 --> 00:44:33,750
but I'm stuck with the
images in my head!

823
00:44:33,833 --> 00:44:36,083
Mrs. Kincaid...

824
00:44:36,166 --> 00:44:37,833
if you know where
your husband is,

825
00:44:37,916 --> 00:44:39,208
you need to tell us.

826
00:44:39,291 --> 00:44:40,583
It's for his own safety.

827
00:44:54,791 --> 00:44:56,583
I'm sorry.

828
00:44:56,666 --> 00:45:00,666
You're worried about
my husband's safety?

829
00:45:00,750 --> 00:45:05,583
No one in this world can
kill Darius Kincaid.

830
00:45:05,666 --> 00:45:08,500
The man is a cucaracha...

831
00:45:08,583 --> 00:45:11,333
and I mean that in every
sense of the word.

832
00:45:11,416 --> 00:45:15,166
Sometimes you just want to
crush his little filthy head

833
00:45:15,250 --> 00:45:16,833
with your shoe...

834
00:45:16,916 --> 00:45:18,750
but he won't die.

835
00:45:18,833 --> 00:45:21,583
That motherfucker is
unkillable, so you can relax.

836
00:45:24,291 --> 00:45:26,000
But wait, no.

837
00:45:26,083 --> 00:45:28,500
There is one important thing
that you should know.

838
00:45:33,708 --> 00:45:35,291
I shit on your
whore of a mother,

839
00:45:35,375 --> 00:45:36,815
and I shit on your
whore of a mother!

840
00:45:36,839 --> 00:45:39,005
Motherfuckers, get out
of my fucking cell.

841
00:45:41,416 --> 00:45:43,125
- Great.
- Now!

842
00:45:43,208 --> 00:45:45,125
And I want that lawyer fired!

843
00:45:45,208 --> 00:45:46,708
I want that lawyer fired!

844
00:45:46,791 --> 00:45:49,125
I want a good one,
professional lawyer!

845
00:45:49,208 --> 00:45:51,666
I have rights! Human rights!

846
00:45:58,416 --> 00:46:01,041
Okay, you can take a
five-minute break.

847
00:46:17,083 --> 00:46:20,916
Good evening. Can I help you?

848
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,291
We need to see your cameras.

849
00:46:23,375 --> 00:46:25,666
Sorry, sir, that's
for management only.

850
00:46:37,291 --> 00:46:38,651
The others have
picked up a signal.

851
00:46:41,416 --> 00:46:42,416
I got you!

852
00:46:47,708 --> 00:46:51,041
- Where we at?
- I backtracked west.

853
00:46:51,125 --> 00:46:55,458
- West is the wrong direction.
- Thank you. Thank you.

854
00:46:55,541 --> 00:46:57,500
They'd be expecting us
to take a direct route.

855
00:46:57,583 --> 00:46:58,983
What the fuck is
that you're eating?

856
00:46:59,007 --> 00:47:00,166
Postpones fatigue.

857
00:47:00,250 --> 00:47:01,708
Refuels glycogen
and electrolytes.

858
00:47:01,791 --> 00:47:03,125
I got you one, too,

859
00:47:03,208 --> 00:47:05,208
while you were taking one
of your world-class naps.

860
00:47:05,232 --> 00:47:06,750
I'd stay awake if
you let me drive.

861
00:47:06,833 --> 00:47:10,125
That's really generous of... No!

862
00:47:10,208 --> 00:47:13,541
- I gotta piss.
- Use that.

863
00:47:13,625 --> 00:47:17,375
Timeline's not built
for another break.

864
00:47:17,458 --> 00:47:20,666
Your dick might fit
in here, but mine...

865
00:47:20,750 --> 00:47:22,625
Plus, I need every
drop of this shit

866
00:47:22,708 --> 00:47:24,875
to tolerate this ride with you.

867
00:47:24,958 --> 00:47:26,833
Just pull the fucking car over.

868
00:47:26,916 --> 00:47:27,916
Jesus Christ.

869
00:47:37,208 --> 00:47:39,666
It'd be a lot easier
without these cuffs,

870
00:47:39,750 --> 00:47:41,208
or this fucking underwear.

871
00:48:02,625 --> 00:48:05,333
Kincaid!

872
00:48:05,416 --> 00:48:06,791
Hey, asshole!

873
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,916
Fucking goddammit,
that's not mud!

874
00:48:17,916 --> 00:48:21,708
- You think I'm a fucking idiot?
- Well...

875
00:48:21,791 --> 00:48:24,375
You did think that cheap
whiskey was piss.

876
00:48:24,458 --> 00:48:26,458
Oh, fuck!

877
00:48:26,541 --> 00:48:28,166
Where the hell did
that come from?

878
00:48:28,250 --> 00:48:29,500
This is what happens

879
00:48:29,583 --> 00:48:32,375
when you mess with a
perfectly laid plan.

880
00:48:32,458 --> 00:48:33,750
- Give me a gun.
- I got this!

881
00:48:33,833 --> 00:48:35,313
- Give me a goddamn gun!
- I got this!

882
00:48:39,083 --> 00:48:41,625
- There's more than one.
- Perfect deduction, Sherlock.

883
00:48:44,369 --> 00:48:45,809
Draw their fire so
I can take a look.

884
00:48:45,833 --> 00:48:47,583
All right. Go!

885
00:48:51,791 --> 00:48:53,250
Shit! Okay.

886
00:48:53,333 --> 00:48:56,375
Three shooters in a
row, all lit up.

887
00:48:56,458 --> 00:48:58,000
So, what do you want to do?

888
00:49:01,833 --> 00:49:03,233
While you can't come
up with a plan,

889
00:49:03,257 --> 00:49:05,048
they're gonna come
down here and kill us.

890
00:49:05,132 --> 00:49:07,625
- So here's the plan.
- What the fuck?

891
00:49:07,708 --> 00:49:09,875
You take 11:00, I'll take 1:00.

892
00:49:09,918 --> 00:49:11,158
Let's see who gets to 12 first.

893
00:49:11,182 --> 00:49:14,583
Okay. On three. You ready?

894
00:49:14,666 --> 00:49:15,833
One...

895
00:49:24,583 --> 00:49:26,000
I said on three. You shot early.

896
00:49:26,083 --> 00:49:27,125
Yeah, before they did.

897
00:49:27,208 --> 00:49:28,208
Let me break it down...

898
00:49:40,458 --> 00:49:44,583
So much for your intricately
calculated travel plans.

899
00:49:44,666 --> 00:49:46,466
That's why I was trying
to bounce on your ass.

900
00:49:46,490 --> 00:49:48,000
See, I'm safer on my own.

901
00:49:48,083 --> 00:49:50,203
There's no way that they
could've known where we were.

902
00:49:50,227 --> 00:49:52,185
Well, they did, and
now they're dead.

903
00:49:56,375 --> 00:49:58,291
This yours? Is this
your cell phone?

904
00:49:58,375 --> 00:50:00,291
I might've taken that
off some dead merc.

905
00:50:00,375 --> 00:50:01,875
You might've...

906
00:50:01,958 --> 00:50:03,958
You know, they can
track a cell phone.

907
00:50:04,041 --> 00:50:06,500
That's why I use a
ghost chip in mine,

908
00:50:06,583 --> 00:50:08,208
so they can't track the phone.

909
00:50:08,291 --> 00:50:10,583
I mean, that's how they
know where we were!

910
00:50:10,666 --> 00:50:12,826
Here I am, I'm plotting courses
all over the country...

911
00:50:12,875 --> 00:50:16,875
and you're carrying a location
beacon in your pocket!

912
00:50:16,958 --> 00:50:19,958
- My bad.
- Your bad?

913
00:50:20,041 --> 00:50:22,458
You don't even understand how
21st century technology works!

914
00:50:22,541 --> 00:50:25,458
I mean, how have you
stayed alive this long?

915
00:50:25,541 --> 00:50:27,166
While all you guys are
wasting your time

916
00:50:27,250 --> 00:50:30,208
planning and aiming
and deducing...

917
00:50:30,291 --> 00:50:31,833
I just do my thing,

918
00:50:31,916 --> 00:50:35,083
and my thing has always been
better than your fucking thing.

919
00:50:35,166 --> 00:50:39,541
Great. There you go.
That's just great.

920
00:50:39,625 --> 00:50:41,906
I'm glad that your thing has
always been better than mine.

921
00:50:43,625 --> 00:50:45,125
You're not gonna take this gun?

922
00:50:45,208 --> 00:50:46,916
No, you keep that gun.
Use it to shoot me.

923
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:48,583
No, I was gonna shoot
you with this...

924
00:50:49,708 --> 00:50:50,708
Shit!

925
00:51:00,500 --> 00:51:02,333
There goes the guns.

926
00:51:02,416 --> 00:51:06,291
Well, look on the bright side.
We get the bad guys' van.

927
00:51:27,333 --> 00:51:28,875
This field smells like your car.

928
00:51:30,958 --> 00:51:34,000
Dude, I said I was
sorry about the phone.

929
00:51:34,083 --> 00:51:35,763
Who knows, maybe your
plan would've worked.

930
00:51:37,602 --> 00:51:38,842
And what about your other plan?

931
00:51:38,866 --> 00:51:39,666
There's no plan!

932
00:51:39,750 --> 00:51:41,416
The plan is we're
in a cow pasture,

933
00:51:41,500 --> 00:51:42,916
that's the plan.

934
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:44,833
I'm talking about your
Agent Roussel plan.

935
00:51:44,916 --> 00:51:46,583
That's why you're
doing this, right?

936
00:51:46,666 --> 00:51:47,750
To get her back?

937
00:51:49,625 --> 00:51:52,416
You think becoming a Triple-A
card-carrying dickhead

938
00:51:52,500 --> 00:51:55,166
is gonna give you an
all-access, backstage pass

939
00:51:55,250 --> 00:51:56,750
to Agent Roussel's ass,

940
00:51:56,833 --> 00:51:57,934
and she'll fall in
love with you...

941
00:51:57,958 --> 00:51:58,791
Oh, I get it. I got it.
You're gonna be the guy...

942
00:51:58,875 --> 00:51:59,892
and your life will
have meaning again.

943
00:51:59,916 --> 00:52:01,556
That the other inmates
come to for advice.

944
00:52:01,580 --> 00:52:02,622
Well, they're very lucky.

945
00:52:03,833 --> 00:52:05,583
Motherfucker, please.

946
00:52:05,666 --> 00:52:08,500
I've eaten hamburgers that know
more about women than you.

947
00:52:08,583 --> 00:52:11,708
You, my friend, are
a romantic retard.

948
00:52:11,791 --> 00:52:13,125
Hey!

949
00:52:13,208 --> 00:52:15,248
Just 'cause I want to get
my business back in order,

950
00:52:15,272 --> 00:52:17,166
that doesn't make
me a shitty person.

951
00:52:17,250 --> 00:52:20,041
And Amelia has nothing,
absolutely nothing,

952
00:52:20,125 --> 00:52:22,500
to do with this.

953
00:52:22,583 --> 00:52:25,958
Oh, man, you are so
in love, it is crazy.

954
00:52:26,041 --> 00:52:28,250
Christ, do you ever shut up?

955
00:52:28,333 --> 00:52:29,458
Huh?

956
00:52:29,541 --> 00:52:31,875
Why is everything always
about love with you?

957
00:52:31,958 --> 00:52:33,583
What else is there?

958
00:52:33,666 --> 00:52:36,166
I mean, take away the
guns, the money...

959
00:52:36,250 --> 00:52:38,791
the travel, the perfect shot

960
00:52:38,875 --> 00:52:41,625
through a motherfucker's
ear hole from 300 meters.

961
00:52:42,833 --> 00:52:44,233
I mean, none of that
shit means dick

962
00:52:44,257 --> 00:52:46,416
if I can't tell Sonia about it.

963
00:52:46,500 --> 00:52:48,583
Well, I guess Amelia's just
not as special as Sonia.

964
00:52:48,666 --> 00:52:50,625
She sounds great.

965
00:52:50,708 --> 00:52:52,541
- What, she cheat on you?
- No.

966
00:52:52,625 --> 00:52:54,375
- Try to kill you?
- No.

967
00:52:54,458 --> 00:52:56,041
'Cause Sonia chopped
off part of my ear

968
00:52:56,125 --> 00:52:57,333
with a machete one time.

969
00:52:57,416 --> 00:53:00,166
She sewed it back on, but...

970
00:53:00,250 --> 00:53:03,666
it was two, three days before
our shit got real again.

971
00:53:03,749 --> 00:53:05,309
Where'd you guys meet,
Christian Mingle?

972
00:53:05,333 --> 00:53:07,625
No. A bar in Honduras.

973
00:53:07,708 --> 00:53:08,708
One of those places

974
00:53:08,791 --> 00:53:11,166
where nobody knows
your face and name.

975
00:53:14,333 --> 00:53:16,291
I'd just come off a job.

976
00:53:16,375 --> 00:53:20,458
Some dude kidnapped the
wrong dude's daughter.

977
00:53:20,541 --> 00:53:22,208
I was sitting there chilling,

978
00:53:22,291 --> 00:53:24,958
when I noticed this waitress
getting hassled by these guys.

979
00:53:29,750 --> 00:53:33,166
I got up to help her
when she unleashed

980
00:53:33,250 --> 00:53:39,083
the most amazing display
of violence and beauty...

981
00:53:39,166 --> 00:53:41,125

995
00:55:05,166 --> 00:55:06,791
- Need a ride?
- Yeah.

996
00:55:06,875 --> 00:55:08,750
We're trying to catch
the ferry to Amsterdam.

997
00:55:08,833 --> 00:55:09,708
Yeah, I can get you there.

998
00:55:09,791 --> 00:55:10,958
- Yeah?
- Jump in.

999
00:55:11,041 --> 00:55:13,708
Hey, there's eyes all
over Amsterdam for me.

1000
00:55:13,791 --> 00:55:15,041
That's where Sonia's locked up.

1001
00:55:15,125 --> 00:55:17,000
It's quick in and out.
I got a place there.

1002
00:55:17,064 --> 00:55:18,224
You got a place in Amsterdam?

1003
00:55:18,248 --> 00:55:19,248
Yeah.

1004
00:55:19,291 --> 00:55:20,916
Is that where you keep the Jag?

1005
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:22,291
You know what?

1006
00:55:22,375 --> 00:55:24,375
Why don't you go fuck
yourself and the horse you...

1007
00:55:24,399 --> 00:55:25,774
Hello.

1008
00:55:28,083 --> 00:55:30,333
Hello, beautiful Sisters.

1009
00:55:34,375 --> 00:55:35,625
Whose lap will I sit on?

1010
00:55:48,541 --> 00:55:49,958
Here's the phone.

1011
00:55:55,166 --> 00:55:59,583
Ivan says Kincaid is
still on the move.

1012
00:55:59,666 --> 00:56:03,166
If God wishes a man dead...

1013
00:56:03,250 --> 00:56:06,500
Ivan will find him.

1014
00:56:06,583 --> 00:56:12,833
And if God's not ready
for Kincaid to die?

1015
00:56:12,916 --> 00:56:16,750
Make sure the back-up
plan is in place.

1016
00:57:00,125 --> 00:57:01,125
One more!

1017
00:57:12,458 --> 00:57:15,208
Your stop, boys!

1018
00:57:15,291 --> 00:57:16,916
You take care, sisters!

1019
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:19,125
Bye, Kincaid!

1020
00:57:21,708 --> 00:57:23,958
Go with God!

1021
00:57:24,041 --> 00:57:26,375
This man's killed
over 150 people.

1022
00:57:26,458 --> 00:57:28,583
250, easy.

1023
00:57:28,666 --> 00:57:30,291
Yeah, but they love you.

1024
00:57:30,375 --> 00:57:33,000
Me, they want to perform
an exorcism on.

1025
00:57:33,083 --> 00:57:35,416
Question for a higher power.

1026
00:57:35,500 --> 00:57:37,333
Who is more wicked,

1027
00:57:37,416 --> 00:57:39,916
he who kills evil
motherfuckers...

1028
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:41,250
or he who protects them?

1029
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:56,041
You really believe
you're the good guy?

1030
00:58:03,208 --> 00:58:06,833
My first contract, I was...

1031
00:58:06,916 --> 00:58:08,416
I don't know, 16, 17.

1032
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:14,583
There was a guy who
broke into a church.

1033
00:58:14,666 --> 00:58:16,916
The preacher was still
there, so he told the guy...

1034
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:18,791
"Look, you don't have
to steal anything.

1035
00:58:18,875 --> 00:58:19,875
Take whatever you want."

1036
00:58:21,166 --> 00:58:22,833
Dude wasn't there for the loot.

1037
00:58:22,916 --> 00:58:24,208
He wanted to hurt somebody.

1038
00:58:30,291 --> 00:58:31,666
Slaughters the preacher,

1039
00:58:31,750 --> 00:58:35,208
displays his body on the altar
for his congregation to see.

1040
00:58:46,500 --> 00:58:49,791
The Bible says never
to take revenge...

1041
00:58:51,583 --> 00:58:53,208
to leave it to the Lord.

1042
00:58:57,083 --> 00:58:58,643
But I wasn't prepared
to wait that long.

1043
00:59:14,666 --> 00:59:20,125
So, when your moral compass gets
around to pointing at me...

1044
00:59:20,208 --> 00:59:24,458
yeah, you'll be pointing
at one of the good guys.

1045
00:59:24,541 --> 00:59:26,000
And how does one
of the good guys

1046
00:59:26,125 --> 00:59:28,833
get connected with a piece
of shit like Dukhovich?

1047
00:59:28,916 --> 00:59:30,596
I didn't know everything
the dude was into.

1048
00:59:30,666 --> 00:59:31,750
That's an easy excuse.

1049
00:59:31,833 --> 00:59:32,833
Look, you know everything

1050
00:59:32,875 --> 00:59:34,155
about every client you ever had?

1051
00:59:34,179 --> 00:59:35,208
Nope. I don't...

1052
00:59:35,291 --> 00:59:37,166
I don't decide whether
my clients live or die.

1053
00:59:48,041 --> 00:59:53,875

1061
01:00:17,833 --> 01:00:21,000
I haven't done a lot of
Amsterdam jobs lately.

1062
01:00:21,083 --> 01:00:22,541
I just need to get my gear.

1063
01:00:22,625 --> 01:00:26,291
The problem is that all the
windows are Poly-Carb.

1064
01:00:26,375 --> 01:00:29,791
They have extra
layers of laminate...

1065
01:00:29,875 --> 01:00:32,000
and obviously there's a
Hetzger alarm system...

1066
01:00:32,083 --> 01:00:34,583
which is the premiere
unit on the market.

1067
01:00:34,666 --> 01:00:36,791
It's got three fail safes.

1068
01:00:36,875 --> 01:00:39,375
But, if I can just...

1069
01:00:47,291 --> 01:00:49,875
- Jesus Christ!
- Nope. Darius Kincaid.

1070
01:00:51,083 --> 01:00:53,791
But there are no words.
I am amazing.

1071
01:00:55,791 --> 01:01:00,125
Oh, that's so cute! You
look so happy here.

1072
01:01:03,500 --> 01:01:05,750
So, is Agent Roussel the
only photograph-worthy girl

1073
01:01:05,833 --> 01:01:07,208
in your life?

1074
01:01:07,291 --> 01:01:08,333
Been busy working.

1075
01:01:09,875 --> 01:01:11,750
Oh, ho, ho!

1076
01:01:11,833 --> 01:01:14,291
You must give me your
designer's number.

1077
01:01:14,375 --> 01:01:16,295
We got four hours to court,
let's get cleaned up.

1078
01:01:16,319 --> 01:01:18,250
I need to change my bandage
and take a shower.

1079
01:01:18,331 --> 01:01:19,851
The hot water still
work in this bitch?

1080
01:01:19,875 --> 01:01:20,958
Upstairs.

1081
01:01:22,250 --> 01:01:23,791
- Elevator?
- No!

1082
01:01:23,875 --> 01:01:24,875
Fuck!

1083
01:01:28,083 --> 01:01:30,375
Counsel, approach the bench.

1084
01:01:30,458 --> 01:01:33,208
How can you allow
Kincaid's testimony?

1085
01:01:33,291 --> 01:01:36,250
A hired killer given
a sweetheart deal.

1086
01:01:36,333 --> 01:01:39,125
A man like that will say
anything to save himself.

1087
01:01:39,208 --> 01:01:41,375
Kincaid has no sweetheart deal.

1088
01:01:41,458 --> 01:01:43,375
His wife will go free, not him.

1089
01:01:48,708 --> 01:01:50,666
The testimony will be allowed...

1090
01:01:50,750 --> 01:01:53,875
assuming you produce your
witness by 5:00 p.m.

1091
01:01:59,708 --> 01:02:01,541
Michael, you should've
been here by now.

1092
01:02:01,585 --> 01:02:02,865
Yeah, yeah, just a couple bumps.

1093
01:02:02,889 --> 01:02:03,958
We're on our way.

1094
01:02:04,041 --> 01:02:05,681
The judge isn't giving
us any wiggle room.

1095
01:02:05,705 --> 01:02:07,625
You have less than
four hours now!

1096
01:02:07,708 --> 01:02:10,166
Well, we're gonna be
there in half that.

1097
01:02:10,250 --> 01:02:11,370
Then why are you calling me?

1098
01:02:13,500 --> 01:02:16,708
Right. Well...

1099
01:02:16,791 --> 01:02:20,458
I'm calling you because
I've been thinking, and...

1100
01:02:24,166 --> 01:02:25,250
I forgive you.

1101
01:02:28,875 --> 01:02:31,125
Yeah.

1102
01:02:31,208 --> 01:02:32,541
It feels good to say that.

1103
01:02:35,791 --> 01:02:37,041
I forgive you, Amelia.

1104
01:02:38,500 --> 01:02:41,666
- Are you fucking kidding me?
- What?

1105
01:02:41,750 --> 01:02:43,125
You're seriously doing this now?

1106
01:02:43,208 --> 01:02:45,125
- No.
- And forgive me for what?

1107
01:02:45,208 --> 01:02:47,208
- What?
- There's nothing to forgive!

1108
01:02:47,291 --> 01:02:50,250
- No, look, I thought that you...
- Just get Kincaid here!

1109
01:02:50,333 --> 01:02:52,250
Fucking prick!

1110
01:03:02,833 --> 01:03:03,833
Darius?

1111
01:03:14,416 --> 01:03:15,541
Fuck!

1112
01:03:20,041 --> 01:03:21,125
Yeah.

1113
01:03:21,208 --> 01:03:22,791
We've got the whole
area covered.

1114
01:03:22,875 --> 01:03:25,000
If Kincaid shows up, he's ours.

1115
01:03:29,041 --> 01:03:30,958
- Stay alert.
- Copy that.

1116
01:03:46,500 --> 01:03:49,083
Everyone keep a close lookout.

1117
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:51,208
Understood.

1118
01:03:58,541 --> 01:04:02,250
- Can I help you?
- Yeah, tulips.

1119
01:04:02,333 --> 01:04:04,208
That will be $25.

1120
01:04:55,208 --> 01:04:56,500
Easy.

1121
01:05:46,625 --> 01:05:48,583
Ay, mi cucaracha.

1122
01:05:57,333 --> 01:06:00,458
You couldn't just have the
flowers delivered, huh?

1123
01:06:00,541 --> 01:06:02,250
Needed a personal touch.

1124
01:06:02,333 --> 01:06:03,351
Well, you were about to
get his personal touch,

1125
01:06:03,375 --> 01:06:04,541
if I hadn't followed you.

1126
01:06:04,625 --> 01:06:05,875
All right, I appreciate that.

1127
01:06:05,958 --> 01:06:07,934
And the guys who started
tracking you a few blocks ago.

1128
01:06:07,958 --> 01:06:09,758
Oh, you mean the guy you
snatched in the bush,

1129
01:06:09,782 --> 01:06:11,657
and the two you left
knocked out in the park?

1130
01:06:11,741 --> 01:06:13,708
Like I said, I appreciate you.

1131
01:06:13,791 --> 01:06:16,000
So, you knew that they
were out there...

1132
01:06:16,083 --> 01:06:17,583
but you still felt
it was important

1133
01:06:17,666 --> 01:06:20,500
to deliver these flowers?

1134
01:06:20,583 --> 01:06:22,375
Sonia's gonna really
love those flowers.

1135
01:06:22,458 --> 01:06:24,041
I sure fucking hope so.

1136
01:06:24,125 --> 01:06:26,666
Now, this is as close
as I'm gonna be to her

1137
01:06:26,750 --> 01:06:29,208
for a very long time.

1138
01:06:29,291 --> 01:06:30,375
It had to be special.

1139
01:06:33,291 --> 01:06:37,291
First. I'm first.

1140
01:06:37,375 --> 01:06:38,791
You were saying?

1141
01:06:38,875 --> 01:06:40,083
Tell me something.

1142
01:06:40,166 --> 01:06:42,250
The day you and Agent
Roussel took that picture,

1143
01:06:42,333 --> 01:06:43,708
I saw in your place...

1144
01:06:43,791 --> 01:06:45,631
what kind of things would
you have done for her

1145
01:06:45,655 --> 01:06:47,125
to make her happy?

1146
01:06:47,208 --> 01:06:48,375
Anything. I loved her.

1147
01:06:48,458 --> 01:06:50,541
Trusted her.

1148
01:06:50,625 --> 01:06:51,958
- She sold me out.
- Huh!

1149
01:06:52,041 --> 01:06:54,166
- Case closed.
- Well, that's cold.

1150
01:06:54,250 --> 01:06:57,500
Maybe, just maybe...

1151
01:06:57,583 --> 01:06:59,875
you ought to give
her a pass on this.

1152
01:06:59,958 --> 01:07:02,416
I mean, I gotta tell
you, honestly...

1153
01:07:02,500 --> 01:07:04,060
there's not a lot of
women in this world

1154
01:07:04,084 --> 01:07:06,041
who'd put up with your shit.

1155
01:07:06,112 --> 01:07:07,392
That's inspirational, thank you.

1156
01:07:07,416 --> 01:07:08,750
What I meant to say was...

1157
01:07:08,833 --> 01:07:10,708
there's no women who
would put up with it.

1158
01:07:10,791 --> 01:07:13,191
You're an annoying motherfucker
with all your rules and shit.

1159
01:07:13,215 --> 01:07:14,615
I mean, if she can
put up with that,

1160
01:07:14,639 --> 01:07:16,625
she must be a pretty
special girl.

1161
01:07:16,708 --> 01:07:19,833
She is.

1162
01:07:21,750 --> 01:07:24,166
You know, I told her today
that I forgave her.

1163
01:07:24,250 --> 01:07:28,458
- Really? And how'd that go?
- Hard to tell.

1164
01:07:28,541 --> 01:07:31,291
You know, women don't like
to be forgiven for shit...

1165
01:07:31,375 --> 01:07:34,083
'cause that implies they did
some shit, to begin with.

1166
01:07:35,625 --> 01:07:37,291
I should just forget
about Kurosawa.

1167
01:07:37,375 --> 01:07:40,958
- What?
- Takashi Kurosawa.

1168
01:07:41,041 --> 01:07:42,791
He was my client,
she exposed him,

1169
01:07:42,875 --> 01:07:44,000
and he got killed.

1170
01:07:49,291 --> 01:07:51,416
Something funny?

1171
01:07:51,500 --> 01:07:54,500
She didn't expose your client!

1172
01:07:54,583 --> 01:07:56,250
I popped Kurosawa!

1173
01:07:57,583 --> 01:07:59,833
I was at the airport
for another target.

1174
01:07:59,916 --> 01:08:01,208
I spotted him by accident.

1175
01:08:01,291 --> 01:08:04,166
Lucky for me, him, not so much.

1176
01:08:04,250 --> 01:08:06,708
Doubled my money on that
corrupt Asian motherfucker.

1177
01:08:06,791 --> 01:08:09,791
The single most awesome...

1178
01:08:09,875 --> 01:08:13,083
shot I've made in my
entire hitman career.

1179
01:08:13,166 --> 01:08:17,458
300 meters through a firm
C-cup tittie-sized window.

1180
01:08:17,541 --> 01:08:19,833
Pow!

1181
01:08:19,916 --> 01:08:23,041
Hey, I thought you knew I
was the one who popped him.

1182
01:08:33,916 --> 01:08:36,583
Oh, shit! What the fuck, Bryce!

1183
01:08:36,666 --> 01:08:38,208
We're done!

1184
01:08:38,291 --> 01:08:39,791
That shit was two
years ago, man.

1185
01:08:39,875 --> 01:08:41,333
You gonna be a little
bitch about it?

1186
01:08:41,416 --> 01:08:43,125
- You're on your own!
- Well, good!

1187
01:08:43,208 --> 01:08:44,500
I'll be safer on my own!

1188
01:08:44,583 --> 01:08:45,958
You won't last one
hour without me!

1189
01:08:46,041 --> 01:08:47,121
You'll be dead in a minute!

1190
01:08:47,166 --> 01:08:48,333
Yeah, you're about as useful

1191
01:08:48,416 --> 01:08:50,416
as a condom in a convent.

1192
01:08:50,500 --> 01:08:53,000
- Eat my ass!
- That's what she said!

1193
01:08:53,083 --> 01:08:56,875
- Suck it! Suck it!
- Fuck you!

1194
01:08:56,958 --> 01:08:59,166
Fucking pussy.

1195
01:09:08,750 --> 01:09:09,833
Fuck!

1196
01:09:18,333 --> 01:09:22,250
Do you have any idea
how prepared I was?

1197
01:09:22,333 --> 01:09:23,458
No, not really.

1198
01:09:23,958 --> 01:09:25,833
No. Every possible
scenario I had covered,

1199
01:09:25,916 --> 01:09:27,125
every kill shot...

1200
01:09:27,208 --> 01:09:29,333
every... every angle.

1201
01:09:34,416 --> 01:09:37,125
And he fucking ruins my
life with one lucky shot

1202
01:09:37,208 --> 01:09:39,916
through a window the size of a...
Just a...

1203
01:09:44,750 --> 01:09:46,166
That's him.

1204
01:09:49,166 --> 01:09:50,708
There he goes again.

1205
01:09:54,166 --> 01:09:56,125
Shots fired! Shots fired!

1206
01:09:56,208 --> 01:09:57,666
I hope they kill him.
I really do.

1207
01:09:57,750 --> 01:09:59,000
Okay.

1208
01:10:02,875 --> 01:10:05,875
Even if I did save him, again,

1209
01:10:05,958 --> 01:10:07,458
you know what he'd say?

1210
01:10:07,541 --> 01:10:09,822
He'd say that I had it all
figured out before he got here.

1211
01:10:12,833 --> 01:10:14,666
He'd say, "I guess my thing"

1212
01:10:14,750 --> 01:10:16,583
is just better than your
thing, motherfucker."

1213
01:10:19,791 --> 01:10:22,916
"I guess bullets are just
allergic to me, motherfucker."

1214
01:10:25,333 --> 01:10:28,750
This guy singlehandedly ruined
the word "motherfucker".

1215
01:10:28,833 --> 01:10:30,193
Do you know how
hard that is to do?

1216
01:10:33,041 --> 01:10:35,416
I was Triple A rated
executive protection.

1217
01:10:35,500 --> 01:10:36,833
Sure.

1218
01:10:39,291 --> 01:10:40,375
I was up here.

1219
01:10:42,791 --> 01:10:45,500
I was up here.

1220
01:10:45,583 --> 01:10:47,000
And goddamnit!

1221
01:11:04,083 --> 01:11:05,083
There he is!

1222
01:11:17,666 --> 01:11:19,333
- Hi.
- Oh, geez!

1223
01:11:33,916 --> 01:11:35,041
Get rid of the Interpol car!

1224
01:11:58,458 --> 01:12:00,791
Requesting all units,
heading south!

1225
01:12:19,958 --> 01:12:20,958
Sorry.

1226
01:12:24,958 --> 01:12:26,958
Move! Move! Move! Move!

1227
01:12:27,041 --> 01:12:28,458
Move! Move! Move!

1228
01:12:29,041 --> 01:12:30,291
Goddamnit!

1229
01:12:47,500 --> 01:12:48,541
Who are these guys?

1230
01:12:50,875 --> 01:12:54,166
- Go, go, go, go.
- Turn!

1231
01:13:00,125 --> 01:13:01,458
Shoot him.

1232
01:13:39,291 --> 01:13:40,500
Hit the brakes!

1233
01:13:42,833 --> 01:13:43,833
Watch out!

1234
01:13:56,125 --> 01:13:58,000
- Drop your weapon!
- This way!

1235
01:14:01,291 --> 01:14:02,416
Fuck!

1236
01:14:03,500 --> 01:14:05,166
Interpol! Interpol!

1237
01:14:11,750 --> 01:14:12,750
Fuck!

1238
01:14:20,500 --> 01:14:23,416
Shit!

1239
01:16:08,916 --> 01:16:10,583
Fuck!

1240
01:16:22,458 --> 01:16:26,000
It's two hours until
the deadline.

1241
01:16:26,083 --> 01:16:27,125
How are we doing?

1242
01:16:27,208 --> 01:16:29,291
Goran has the bodyguard.

1243
01:16:29,375 --> 01:16:30,655
I'm going to
interrogate him now.

1244
01:16:30,679 --> 01:16:34,083
No, I need you here in
case Kincaid shows up.

1245
01:16:34,166 --> 01:16:35,875
Goran will make him talk.

1246
01:16:39,625 --> 01:16:40,875
Okay.

1247
01:16:46,958 --> 01:16:49,750
What kind of asshole wears
a helmet this tight?

1248
01:16:49,833 --> 01:16:52,708
A loose helmet is like
wearing no helmet at all.

1249
01:16:52,791 --> 01:16:54,541
It's not a button strap.

1250
01:16:54,625 --> 01:16:56,208
It's a D-ring.

1251
01:16:56,291 --> 01:16:58,916
Just unthread it through the
thing, it's very simple.

1252
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:02,541
Oh, well, or there's...
there's that shortcut.

1253
01:17:09,625 --> 01:17:11,458
Ew!

1254
01:17:18,208 --> 01:17:21,416
I ask you one time, polite.

1255
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:24,458
Where is Kincaid?

1256
01:17:27,166 --> 01:17:29,583
Honestly, I'd tell
you if I knew.

1257
01:17:29,666 --> 01:17:30,958
You have my word.

1258
01:17:31,041 --> 01:17:32,958
Look at my right hand.

1259
01:17:33,041 --> 01:17:34,250
See that?

1260
01:17:34,333 --> 01:17:36,166
That's a Boy Scout salute.

1261
01:17:36,250 --> 01:17:37,625
We're sworn to never lie.

1262
01:17:37,708 --> 01:17:39,268
I've taken an oath,
so you can trust me.

1263
01:17:39,292 --> 01:17:43,167
Ahhh! Right in the fucking ear!

1264
01:17:45,666 --> 01:17:47,791
Waterboarding? Really?

1265
01:17:47,875 --> 01:17:49,041
I was in the CIA.

1266
01:17:49,125 --> 01:17:50,625
You know, we don't
do that anymore.

1267
01:17:52,375 --> 01:17:54,083
Okay. Hey, hey. Hold it.
Whoa, whoa.

1268
01:17:54,166 --> 01:17:55,766
Wait, wait, wait.
Here's what we learned.

1269
01:17:55,790 --> 01:17:57,416
The key to interrogation...

1270
01:17:57,500 --> 01:17:58,958
is establishing a bond

1271
01:17:59,041 --> 01:18:01,875
between the interrogator
and the subject, okay?

1272
01:18:01,958 --> 01:18:04,333
You know, just sort of
like a rapport, okay?

1273
01:18:04,416 --> 01:18:06,375
You need me to like you.

1274
01:18:06,458 --> 01:18:08,000
You need me to like you, okay?

1275
01:18:08,083 --> 01:18:10,375
You need me to like you!

1276
01:18:20,458 --> 01:18:22,791
I really don't like you.

1277
01:18:22,875 --> 01:18:24,583
Okay, okay, okay.

1278
01:18:33,333 --> 01:18:37,291
- Where is Kincaid?
- He's right behind you.

1279
01:18:37,375 --> 01:18:38,916
Scout's honor. Fuck!

1280
01:20:03,833 --> 01:20:06,083
Fuck!

1281
01:20:06,166 --> 01:20:08,958
Hey listen, before
you start talking...

1282
01:20:09,041 --> 01:20:11,541
'cause I know you're gonna
start fucking talking...

1283
01:20:11,625 --> 01:20:16,166
I just want to apologize for
laughing about popping Kurosawa.

1284
01:20:16,250 --> 01:20:19,458
I know that shit cost you
your girl and that...

1285
01:20:19,541 --> 01:20:22,708
fake-ass, made-up Triple A
shit you keep talking about.

1286
01:20:22,791 --> 01:20:25,250
No, it was all my fault.

1287
01:20:25,333 --> 01:20:27,208
No...

1288
01:20:27,291 --> 01:20:29,083
I did it all to myself.

1289
01:20:29,166 --> 01:20:31,416
Bryce, please! Come on, you
didn't do it to yourself.

1290
01:20:31,500 --> 01:20:34,791
- That's life. Life happens.
- Life without Amelia.

1291
01:20:37,125 --> 01:20:39,958
Hey, still time to
work that shit out.

1292
01:20:42,208 --> 01:20:43,750
So, how'd you and
Agent Roussel meet?

1293
01:20:46,708 --> 01:20:50,041
On a job.

1294
01:20:50,125 --> 01:20:53,208
She was...

1295
01:20:53,291 --> 01:20:56,416
She was working an
undercover op...

1296
01:20:56,500 --> 01:20:59,375
very badly.

1297
01:20:59,458 --> 01:21:02,708
I was at a client's funeral.
Massive heart attack.

1298
01:21:02,791 --> 01:21:04,751
I can protect someone from
bullets and explosives,

1299
01:21:04,833 --> 01:21:06,458
but there's nothing I can do

1300
01:21:06,541 --> 01:21:08,101
against indiscriminate
use of mayonnaise

1301
01:21:08,125 --> 01:21:10,291
for 68 straight years.

1302
01:21:10,375 --> 01:21:12,291
Technically, I was still
on the payroll...

1303
01:21:12,375 --> 01:21:14,916
so I was in the building,
paying my respects.

1304
01:21:22,375 --> 01:21:25,250
Amelia was there with some of
her other Interpol agents.

1305
01:21:25,333 --> 01:21:26,733
They were hoping to
bust my client's

1306
01:21:26,757 --> 01:21:28,750
shady and mayonnaise-chugging
brother.

1307
01:21:28,833 --> 01:21:30,958
Instead of doing things
nice and quiet...

1308
01:21:31,041 --> 01:21:33,791
they got marked, and
their target runs.

1309
01:21:33,875 --> 01:21:35,291
Oh, yeah.

1310
01:21:35,375 --> 01:21:37,500
Leave it to Interpol to turn
a really fun funeral...

1311
01:21:37,583 --> 01:21:39,143
with lots of delicious
hors d'oeuvres...

1312
01:21:39,167 --> 01:21:41,666
into a depressing carnival show
of total unprofessionalism.

See, that's what
I'm talking about.

1322
01:22:30,041 --> 01:22:31,666
It just happened!

1323
01:22:31,750 --> 01:22:34,291
You didn't plan it,
deduce it, or Google

1324
01:22:34,375 --> 01:22:36,000
running into the
girl of your dreams.

1325
01:22:36,083 --> 01:22:37,458
You just bumped into her,

1326
01:22:37,541 --> 01:22:40,000
the same way I just
bumped into Kurosawa.

1327
01:22:40,083 --> 01:22:42,416
You know, when life
gives you shit...

1328
01:22:42,500 --> 01:22:43,666
you make Kool-Aid.

1329
01:22:46,916 --> 01:22:48,791
That's not really how
that expression works.

1330
01:22:48,875 --> 01:22:49,791
Yeah, and that's the beauty

1331
01:22:49,875 --> 01:22:52,000
Life.

1332
01:22:52,083 --> 01:22:54,125
Yeah, well, life, I mean...

1333
01:22:54,208 --> 01:22:55,666
life doesn't usually
give you shit

1334
01:22:55,750 --> 01:22:57,625
and then turn into a beverage.

1335
01:22:57,708 --> 01:23:00,833
Not... at least where I'm from,
that's not how it works.

1336
01:23:00,916 --> 01:23:02,142
Look, motherfucker, you
don't have to explain

1337
01:23:02,166 --> 01:23:04,208

1338
01:23:04,291 --> 01:23:05,375

1339
01:23:05,458 --> 01:23:06,684
You don't need fucking
reasons for that shit.

1340
01:23:06,708 --> 01:23:07,541
You would make maybe
some lemonade.

1341
01:23:07,625 --> 01:23:09,541
Just shut the fuck up!

1342
01:23:14,458 --> 01:23:16,416

Breaking news from
The Hague suggests

1347
01:23:31,708 --> 01:23:33,468
that if a credible witness
cannot be produced

1348
01:23:33,492 --> 01:23:34,833
within the next hour,

1349
01:23:34,916 --> 01:23:37,583
the former president of
Belarus, Vladimir Dukhovich,

1350
01:23:37,666 --> 01:23:39,791
will walk free and resume power.

1351
01:23:39,875 --> 01:23:42,208
This would be a
spectacular embarrassment

1352
01:23:42,291 --> 01:23:44,333
for the international
community...

1353
01:23:44,416 --> 01:23:47,791
and a crushing blow for the many
relatives who alleged that...

1354
01:23:52,291 --> 01:23:54,666
They're out there...

1355
01:23:54,750 --> 01:23:58,208
waiting for us to
make the first move.

1356
01:23:58,291 --> 01:24:00,625
I know I would be.

1357
01:24:00,708 --> 01:24:03,083
- I should've told Amelia.
- Told her what?

1358
01:24:03,166 --> 01:24:05,583
That I'm a stupid man.

1359
01:24:09,250 --> 01:24:13,541
Hey, what if I told you
I couldn't protect you?

1360
01:24:13,625 --> 01:24:15,875
I'd say you're right.

1361
01:24:15,958 --> 01:24:17,291
We'll just go to Amsterdam,

1362
01:24:17,375 --> 01:24:19,833
I'll help you get Sonia out...

1363
01:24:19,916 --> 01:24:22,000
and you give her those
flowers in person.

1364
01:24:22,083 --> 01:24:24,250
No fucking way.

1365
01:24:24,333 --> 01:24:27,000
I gotta help you get back that
Triple A shit I fucked up.

1366
01:24:27,083 --> 01:24:29,000
The guilt's killing me.

1367
01:24:29,083 --> 01:24:32,208
Dukhovich, that
motherfucker's gotta go.

1368
01:24:32,291 --> 01:24:34,791
Well, it's not gonna happen
unless we get there.

1369
01:24:34,875 --> 01:24:37,500
- Shit, I'd bet on them.
- Normally I would, too.

1370
01:24:37,583 --> 01:24:38,791
I got a hot tip.

1371
01:24:38,875 --> 01:24:40,958
There's a couple of
ringers in the game.

1372
01:24:41,041 --> 01:24:42,161
We got our choice of wheels.

1373
01:24:42,208 --> 01:24:48,375
Hmm! That's a good-looking Jag.

1374
01:24:48,458 --> 01:24:50,375
Yeah. I guarantee you,
if that smells like ass,

1375
01:24:50,458 --> 01:24:52,583
it's supermodel ass.

1376
01:24:57,791 --> 01:25:00,833
- Really?
- Oh, yeah.

1377
01:25:00,916 --> 01:25:02,083
She blends right in.

1378
01:25:22,583 --> 01:25:26,166
Ohh! That's responsive!

1379
01:25:26,250 --> 01:25:27,625
Jesus.

1380
01:25:27,708 --> 01:25:30,625
You know, I have a pen knife.

1381
01:25:30,708 --> 01:25:33,028
It's just that the gearshift's
on the right-hand side here,

1382
01:25:33,052 --> 01:25:34,083
and I'm not used to that.

1383
01:25:34,166 --> 01:25:36,017
- It's practically impossible...
- Get out of the fucking car.

1384
01:25:36,041 --> 01:25:37,201
A three-day adjustment period

1385
01:25:37,225 --> 01:25:38,250
to figure this out.

1386
01:25:38,333 --> 01:25:40,291
Motherfucker, I will
bust a cap in your ass

1387
01:25:40,375 --> 01:25:41,875
if you don't give up that wheel.

1388
01:25:41,958 --> 01:25:43,558
Have you ever said
please or thank you...

1389
01:25:43,582 --> 01:25:44,791
Please, motherfucker!

1390
01:25:44,875 --> 01:25:45,976
- Why are we always yelling?
- Get out of the fucking car!

1391
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:47,083
Fine.

1392
01:25:51,291 --> 01:25:54,500
Time's just about up.

1393
01:25:54,583 --> 01:25:57,458
No sign. They vanished
in Amsterdam.

1394
01:25:57,541 --> 01:25:59,208
Dukhovich is free.

1395
01:25:59,291 --> 01:26:00,691
Michael would never
let that happen.

1396
01:26:00,715 --> 01:26:03,215
It appears you're wrong
about your Michael Bryce.

1397
01:26:15,208 --> 01:26:17,125
- Hello?
- Hey.

1398
01:26:17,208 --> 01:26:18,541
Michael, where are you?

1399
01:26:18,625 --> 01:26:19,750
We're a couple minutes out.

1400
01:26:23,416 --> 01:26:25,166
Look...

1401
01:26:25,250 --> 01:26:28,208
I wanna tell you that I'm sorry.

1402
01:26:28,291 --> 01:26:30,333
I wanna say that
I'm sorry for...

1403
01:26:30,416 --> 01:26:31,750
for everything.

1404
01:26:31,833 --> 01:26:34,541
For Kurosawa, us,
it's all my fault.

1405
01:26:34,625 --> 01:26:36,583
You know, I act like a...

1406
01:26:36,666 --> 01:26:38,708
I act like a fucking
child around you.

1407
01:26:38,786 --> 01:26:40,226
And I can't admit
that it's my fault,

1408
01:26:40,250 --> 01:26:42,666
and I project that onto
you, and that's not fair.

1409
01:26:42,750 --> 01:26:44,541
You deserve better than that.

1410
01:26:46,375 --> 01:26:47,375
That's them!

1411
01:26:49,041 --> 01:26:50,750
Why are you telling me this now?

1412
01:26:50,833 --> 01:26:53,500
Well, under the circumstances,
it seemed like a good time.

1413
01:26:53,583 --> 01:26:55,416
- We got company.
- Huh?

1414
01:27:00,791 --> 01:27:03,250
We have them. Blue Ford
C-Max on Route 44.

1415
01:27:03,333 --> 01:27:04,833
Let's go!

1416
01:27:14,208 --> 01:27:15,375
Amelia...

1417
01:27:20,125 --> 01:27:21,333
Amelia...

1418
01:27:24,458 --> 01:27:29,833
- I just want to say that...
- I love you.

1419
01:27:40,333 --> 01:27:42,833
Jesus Christ! Really?

1420
01:27:42,916 --> 01:27:44,541
What happened to
the seatbelt rule?

1421
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:55,000
Oh, fuck!

1422
01:27:57,625 --> 01:28:00,750
- What the fuck, man!
- Move your fucking car!

1423
01:28:25,208 --> 01:28:28,958
- Michael? Hello?
- Who this?

1424
01:28:29,041 --> 01:28:33,250
Agent Roussel, hold on, let
me put you on speaker.

1425
01:28:33,333 --> 01:28:35,541
- What happened to Michael?
- He had to bounce.

1426
01:28:38,666 --> 01:28:39,916
Excuse me. Sorry.

1427
01:28:44,625 --> 01:28:46,025
You know, he really
cares about you.

1428
01:28:47,291 --> 01:28:49,625
He has a hard time processing
emotions and shit.

1429
01:28:59,583 --> 01:29:02,416
But one thing his fucked-up
brain has figured out,

1430
01:29:02,500 --> 01:29:03,625
he really loves you.

1431
01:29:12,875 --> 01:29:14,235
Are you in the
middle of something?

1432
01:29:14,259 --> 01:29:15,625
Well, actually, yeah, I am.

1433
01:29:15,708 --> 01:29:16,958
Look, we'll call you back.

1434
01:30:40,083 --> 01:30:41,083
Watch out!

1435
01:31:51,166 --> 01:31:52,166
Okay, you had...

1436
01:34:06,416 --> 01:34:09,333
If you wouldn't mind...

1437
01:34:09,416 --> 01:34:10,416
the gun.

1438
01:34:12,083 --> 01:34:13,166
Yes.

1439
01:34:23,125 --> 01:34:24,250
Thanks.

1440
01:34:35,916 --> 01:34:39,041
Thank you.

1441
01:34:42,958 --> 01:34:45,416
Yo! You about done?

1442
01:34:45,500 --> 01:34:47,458
Tick tock, motherfucker!

1443
01:34:49,208 --> 01:34:51,458
He's fucking unkillable.

1444
01:34:54,210 --> 01:34:55,490
With just five minutes remaining

1445
01:34:55,514 --> 01:34:56,875
before the court's deadline,

1446
01:34:56,958 --> 01:34:58,541
the case against
Vladislav Dukhovich

1447
01:34:58,625 --> 01:35:00,375
is almost certainly doomed.

1448
01:35:08,500 --> 01:35:10,333
Suspicious vehicle is
approaching, Commander.

1449
01:35:10,416 --> 01:35:11,541
Stop the car!

1450
01:35:15,250 --> 01:35:17,333
What's going on here?

1451
01:35:19,958 --> 01:35:21,458
Is this what we've
been waiting for?

1452
01:35:24,041 --> 01:35:25,041
Shit.

1453
01:35:33,125 --> 01:35:37,125
I got your witness,
Darius Kincaid.

1454
01:35:37,208 --> 01:35:38,375
Follow me.

1455
01:35:41,625 --> 01:35:44,333
Obviously, Your Honor,
this has developed

1456
01:35:44,416 --> 01:35:47,500
into a complete waste
of my client's time.

1457
01:35:47,583 --> 01:35:49,500
The prosecution has no
witness to present.

1458
01:35:52,708 --> 01:35:54,500
Can you empty your
pockets, please, sir.

1459
01:36:00,875 --> 01:36:02,208
Are you kidding me? Come on!

1460
01:36:06,083 --> 01:36:07,958
As we seem to be
reaching our deadline,

1461
01:36:08,041 --> 01:36:10,208
I have no choice but to declare

1462
01:36:10,291 --> 01:36:12,916
that this trial has
come to its natural...

1463
01:36:22,416 --> 01:36:25,500
Your Honor, I present
Darius Kincaid.

1464
01:36:25,583 --> 01:36:27,291
The deadline has passed!

1465
01:36:27,375 --> 01:36:30,833
I believe we still had a
few seconds on the clock.

1466
01:36:31,958 --> 01:36:33,375
How do I look?

1467
01:36:33,458 --> 01:36:36,125
You got a little speck
of blood on your...

1468
01:36:36,208 --> 01:36:37,541
everywhere.

1469
01:36:37,625 --> 01:36:41,000
Will the prosecution please
prepare their witness.

1470
01:36:41,083 --> 01:36:42,500
- Hi.
- My God, are you okay?

1471
01:36:42,583 --> 01:36:46,250
Yeah. There's your guy.

1472
01:36:46,333 --> 01:36:50,500
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

1473
01:36:50,583 --> 01:36:51,703
By the way, bumping into you

1474
01:36:51,750 --> 01:36:53,430
is the best thing that
ever happened to me.

1475
01:37:00,652 --> 01:37:01,892
Do you swear to tell the truth,

1476
01:37:01,916 --> 01:37:03,791
the whole truth, and
nothing but the truth?

1477
01:37:03,875 --> 01:37:06,791
Yeah.

1478
01:37:06,875 --> 01:37:09,916
Your name is Darius Kincaid?

1479
01:37:10,000 --> 01:37:14,166
No. My real name
is Darius Evans.

1480
01:37:14,250 --> 01:37:16,375
My parents separated
when I was six.

1481
01:37:16,458 --> 01:37:18,875
My mother remarried a
real mean piece of work

1482
01:37:18,958 --> 01:37:20,958
named Roger Kincaid.

1483
01:37:21,541 --> 01:37:23,333
She figured if I took his name,

1484
01:37:23,416 --> 01:37:25,458
he'd keep his belt
on more often.

1485
01:37:25,541 --> 01:37:28,000
Plan didn't work so well,
but the name stuck.

1486
01:37:28,083 --> 01:37:31,916
My real father's name is
Maurice Evans, preacher.

1487
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:35,250
He was killed a few years
later in his own church.

1488
01:37:35,333 --> 01:37:37,053
- I'm sorry, I didn't...
- That's all right.

1489
01:37:37,077 --> 01:37:38,500
Can't research everything.

1490
01:37:38,583 --> 01:37:39,833
Mr. Kincaid,

1491
01:37:39,916 --> 01:37:43,625
were you ever in the employ
of Vladislav Dukhovich?

1492
01:37:43,708 --> 01:37:47,333
- No.
- Have you ever met Dukhovich?

1493
01:37:47,416 --> 01:37:48,500
Yes.

1494
01:37:48,583 --> 01:37:52,708
April 17, 2012, he invited
me to his palace.

1495
01:37:52,791 --> 01:37:55,166
Prosecution Exhibit 17-D,

1496
01:37:55,250 --> 01:37:57,250
palace security logs.

1497
01:37:57,333 --> 01:38:00,375
Did he offer you
employment then?

1498
01:38:00,458 --> 01:38:02,666
Yes, he did.

1499
01:38:02,750 --> 01:38:05,291
He wanted me to take
out a political rival

1500
01:38:05,375 --> 01:38:06,791
exiled in the UK.

1501
01:38:09,333 --> 01:38:11,291
- I refused.
- Why?

1502
01:38:11,375 --> 01:38:12,583
Because while I was there,

1503
01:38:12,666 --> 01:38:15,541
he ordered his men to slaughter
a village outside Polatsk.

1504
01:38:18,458 --> 01:38:20,625
I'm not down with killing
innocent people.

1505
01:38:20,708 --> 01:38:22,833
And do you have evidence
to corroborate this?

1506
01:38:22,916 --> 01:38:25,375
Yeah.

1507
01:38:25,458 --> 01:38:28,708
Go to FTP site Raven 257.

1508
01:38:30,125 --> 01:38:33,458
- Just load it up.
- Exhibit 18-D.

1509
01:38:33,541 --> 01:38:35,791
We've confirmed the coordinates.

1510
01:38:35,875 --> 01:38:36,955
It's asking for a password.

1511
01:38:37,000 --> 01:38:38,333
Oh, sorry.

1512
01:38:38,416 --> 01:38:39,958
Password...

1513
01:38:40,041 --> 01:38:43,875
Dukhovich is a dick, all caps,
except "dick" is lowercase.

1514
01:38:46,500 --> 01:38:48,416
I wasn't gonna trust
Interpol with this shit.

1515
01:39:00,250 --> 01:39:01,250
Order!

1516
01:39:05,333 --> 01:39:07,125
Order!

1517
01:39:10,458 --> 01:39:14,125
Order in the Court!

1518
01:39:14,208 --> 01:39:16,291
Your Honors...

1519
01:39:16,375 --> 01:39:19,000
I could save us all some time.

1520
01:39:19,083 --> 01:39:20,875
May I address the court?

1521
01:39:22,333 --> 01:39:24,333
Initiate alternate measures.

1522
01:39:24,416 --> 01:39:26,250
For months, I have been sitting

1523
01:39:26,333 --> 01:39:27,666
in this chair...

1524
01:39:27,750 --> 01:39:32,333
nodding along to this
ludicrous charade.

1525
01:39:32,416 --> 01:39:33,541
Excuse me.

1526
01:39:33,625 --> 01:39:34,875
My excellent attorney

1527
01:39:34,958 --> 01:39:37,958
was hoping for the legitimacy
of a formal acquittal...

1528
01:39:38,041 --> 01:39:39,625
but that is no longer possible.

1529
01:39:39,708 --> 01:39:42,083
Thank you, Darius.

1530
01:39:42,166 --> 01:39:45,625
So, let us now end the charade.

1531
01:39:45,708 --> 01:39:48,416
The charges against me...

1532
01:39:48,500 --> 01:39:52,166
are entirely correct.

1533
01:39:52,250 --> 01:39:55,500
I am the rightful
ruler of Belarus!

1534
01:39:55,583 --> 01:39:57,208
Mr. Dukhovich, sit down!

1535
01:39:57,291 --> 01:40:00,666
As the ruler of my nation,
I will do as I wish,

1536
01:40:00,750 --> 01:40:02,583
without exception,
without apology.

1537
01:40:02,666 --> 01:40:05,208
I recognize no authority

1538
01:40:05,291 --> 01:40:07,451
- that limits my power!
- Mr. Dukhovich, I order you...

1539
01:40:10,666 --> 01:40:13,083
- Assistant Director.
- Go do your job, Amelia!

1540
01:40:14,916 --> 01:40:16,833
In this trial,

1541
01:40:16,916 --> 01:40:20,791
the world community is
attempting to make a statement!

1542
01:40:20,875 --> 01:40:24,000
Well, now I would like to
make a statement of my own!

1543
01:40:29,500 --> 01:40:30,500
Show me your phone.

1544
01:40:34,125 --> 01:40:38,000
I recognize no authority
that limits my powers!

1545
01:40:50,375 --> 01:40:52,166
Everybody, go!

1546
01:40:57,833 --> 01:41:01,791
I will now take my leave
with my dignity intact!

1547
01:41:28,958 --> 01:41:31,416
Now that's what I call
Triple A service.

1548
01:41:31,500 --> 01:41:33,708
Fuck!

1549
01:41:33,791 --> 01:41:36,500
Oh, fuck! Medic! Medic!

1550
01:41:36,583 --> 01:41:38,583
I need a medic over here!

1551
01:41:38,666 --> 01:41:39,986
- Lockdown protocol!
- Don't move!

1552
01:41:52,333 --> 01:41:53,333
We're here live

1553
01:41:53,416 --> 01:41:55,791
in front of the ICC
in The Hague...

1554
01:41:55,875 --> 01:41:58,458
where a truck bomb
has just plowed

1555
01:41:58,541 --> 01:42:00,625
into a crowd of protestors.

1556
01:42:00,708 --> 01:42:01,708
Emergency!

1557
01:42:01,791 --> 01:42:03,208
It's a critical
health situation!

1558
01:42:03,291 --> 01:42:05,333
We need immediate air
and ground support!

1559
01:42:08,708 --> 01:42:10,000
Focus on me, Bryce.

1560
01:42:10,083 --> 01:42:12,083
Bryce! Focus on me.

1561
01:42:12,166 --> 01:42:13,416
I'd really rather not.

1562
01:42:16,166 --> 01:42:19,541
All units. All units.

1563
01:42:19,625 --> 01:42:22,833
Stay with me, Bryce.
Stay with me.

1564
01:42:22,916 --> 01:42:25,125
I did my job. You go do yours.

1565
01:42:25,208 --> 01:42:27,583
Go! You gotta go get
that motherfucker!

1566
01:42:31,333 --> 01:42:33,208
Freeze! On your knees.

1567
01:42:43,125 --> 01:42:46,875
Tower, AirMed 1 requests
priority clearance...

1568
01:42:46,958 --> 01:42:49,000
to restricted zone for
casualty extraction.

1569
01:42:49,083 --> 01:42:50,916
Officer, the building
is in lockdown.

1570
01:42:51,000 --> 01:42:52,875
Dukhovich does not
leave his cell.

1571
01:42:58,916 --> 01:43:00,625
Let's go!

1572
01:43:18,000 --> 01:43:19,333
It's over, Assistant Director.

1573
01:43:19,416 --> 01:43:20,416
Give up.

1574
01:44:01,916 --> 01:44:04,416
I didn't want to
do this, Amelia.

1575
01:44:04,500 --> 01:44:05,541
I swear to you.

1576
01:44:34,500 --> 01:44:35,500
Oh, fuck!

1577
01:44:46,791 --> 01:44:49,375
Michael! Michael!

1578
01:44:49,458 --> 01:44:53,083
- Michael, you hear me?
- Are you okay? Yeah?

1579
01:44:53,166 --> 01:44:54,875
- Yeah.
- Good, good, Good.

1580
01:44:54,958 --> 01:44:58,250
You? Oh, no.

1581
01:44:58,333 --> 01:45:01,416
- You're bleeding.
- Oh, no, no, no. I'm fine.

1582
01:45:06,041 --> 01:45:07,041
I'll get some help.

1583
01:45:08,500 --> 01:45:09,500
Stay here.

1584
01:45:26,375 --> 01:45:27,791
Take her down!

1585
01:45:51,291 --> 01:45:53,666
Ahh, ahh, ahh!

1586
01:45:53,750 --> 01:45:55,333
Up on the ledge, Dookie man.

1587
01:45:58,875 --> 01:46:02,041
You heard me, bitch!
Up on the ledge!

1588
01:46:18,000 --> 01:46:19,791
The look on your face.

1589
01:46:22,041 --> 01:46:24,166
You're so proud.

1590
01:46:24,250 --> 01:46:27,291
Darius Kincaid...

1591
01:46:27,375 --> 01:46:30,916
about to be a hero,
save the day.

1592
01:46:31,000 --> 01:46:33,375
None of that matters.

1593
01:46:33,458 --> 01:46:35,083
There is no redemption,

1594
01:46:35,166 --> 01:46:38,416
no atonement for a man like you.

1595
01:46:38,500 --> 01:46:44,375
Your whole life has been
but a trail of corpses...

1596
01:46:44,458 --> 01:46:48,958
and I will be just another
dead body on the pile!

1597
01:46:49,041 --> 01:46:55,458
Go ahead! Finish me!

1598
01:46:55,541 --> 01:46:59,916
But don't think for a moment
it will change what you are.

1599
01:47:06,708 --> 01:47:10,250
I don't give a fuck
about all of that!

1600
01:47:10,333 --> 01:47:13,416
You fucked up when you shot...

1601
01:47:13,500 --> 01:47:17,000
my bodyguard.

1602
01:47:17,083 --> 01:47:18,750
Who?

1603
01:47:31,750 --> 01:47:36,250
Dukhovich. It's Dukhovich.

1604
01:48:00,958 --> 01:48:03,833
Okay, here's what I'm thinking.

1605
01:48:03,916 --> 01:48:05,583
Celebrity security.

1606
01:48:05,708 --> 01:48:07,291
It's low stress.

1607
01:48:07,375 --> 01:48:09,541
Boy bands and shit, right?

1608
01:48:09,585 --> 01:48:10,785
One of those guys gets killed,

1609
01:48:10,809 --> 01:48:13,375
nobody's getting all
that mad at me.

1610
01:48:13,458 --> 01:48:15,833
- Well, we'll figure it out.
- We will?

1611
01:48:17,208 --> 01:48:18,875
Yo!

1612
01:48:18,958 --> 01:48:23,208
What a brother gotta do to get
arrested up in this bitch?

1613
01:48:23,291 --> 01:48:25,500
Can't someone just Taser him?

1614
01:48:25,583 --> 01:48:27,583
I mean, like, a
non-lethal Taser.

1615
01:48:27,666 --> 01:48:30,041
Director Casoria.

1616
01:48:30,125 --> 01:48:31,791
My deal still good?

1617
01:48:31,875 --> 01:48:34,833
You definitely held up your end, Mr.
Kincaid.

1618
01:48:34,916 --> 01:48:36,375
Agent Roussel,

1619
01:48:36,458 --> 01:48:39,583
why don't you go find Mr.
Kincaid some handcuffs.

1620
01:48:39,666 --> 01:48:41,291
With pleasure.

1621
01:48:44,750 --> 01:48:47,458
You were right to
trust your instincts.

1622
01:48:47,541 --> 01:48:48,875
Well done.

1623
01:48:48,958 --> 01:48:49,958
Thank you, ma'am.

1624
01:48:52,791 --> 01:48:54,833
- You're welcome.
- For what?

1625
01:48:54,916 --> 01:48:57,083
I got you a front row seat
to the Roussel show...

1626
01:48:57,166 --> 01:48:59,083
and I got you that
all-access backstage pass

1627
01:48:59,166 --> 01:49:00,708
to that ass you've
been wanting so bad.

1628
01:49:00,791 --> 01:49:02,166
You did what?

1629
01:49:02,250 --> 01:49:03,476
Well, you know, when you
jumped out of the car...

1630
01:49:03,500 --> 01:49:06,041
- I gave her the 411 on you.
- I didn't jump out of the...

1631
01:49:06,125 --> 01:49:07,875
I went through the
fucking windshield.

1632
01:49:07,958 --> 01:49:09,375
- Semantics.
- Semantics?

1633
01:49:09,458 --> 01:49:10,750
Semantics. Yeah,
just another way

1634
01:49:10,833 --> 01:49:11,750
of saying the same thing...

1635
01:49:11,833 --> 01:49:13,541
I know what semantics means.

1636
01:49:13,625 --> 01:49:15,434
I also know that I don't need
to take love advice from you.

1637
01:49:15,458 --> 01:49:17,258
Oh, really? So tell me
how that love life shit

1638
01:49:17,282 --> 01:49:18,990
was going before I showed up.

1639
01:49:22,583 --> 01:49:24,958
You know, she's gonna
be right back,

1640
01:49:25,041 --> 01:49:26,458
and that's it.

1641
01:49:26,541 --> 01:49:28,125
Last chance to run.

1642
01:49:28,168 --> 01:49:29,448
I'm going along with the program

1643
01:49:29,472 --> 01:49:30,958
till Sonia's free.

1644
01:49:31,041 --> 01:49:33,500
Then I do my thing.

1645
01:49:33,583 --> 01:49:35,791
You really think it's gonna
be that easy, do you?

1646
01:49:35,875 --> 01:49:37,000
Motherfucker, please.

1647
01:49:37,083 --> 01:49:39,041
You know when I want some
shit to pop, it pops.

1648
01:49:39,125 --> 01:49:40,965
Like that shot through
that tittie-small window

1649
01:49:40,989 --> 01:49:42,250
on Kurosawa's plane.

1650
01:49:42,333 --> 01:49:43,750
Okay, that's enough out of you.

1651
01:49:43,833 --> 01:49:45,000
Show me the face you made

1652
01:49:45,083 --> 01:49:46,809
- when that shit went down.
- That still stings, all right?

1653
01:49:46,833 --> 01:49:48,713
I know you wasn't expecting
that shit to happen.

1654
01:49:48,737 --> 01:49:49,958
Yeah, I was expecting you

1655
01:49:50,041 --> 01:49:51,875
to blow my client's head off.

1656
01:49:51,958 --> 01:49:53,358
Did you have that
"Home Alone" face,

1657
01:49:53,382 --> 01:49:54,416
like ooh!

1658
01:49:54,500 --> 01:49:56,166
Do you guys have handcuffs?

1659
01:49:56,250 --> 01:49:57,250
Do you have any?

1660
01:50:03,791 --> 01:50:05,083
A worldwide red notice

1661
01:50:05,166 --> 01:50:08,458
was issued today for contract
killer Darius Kincaid.

1662
01:50:08,541 --> 01:50:12,041
Kincaid has escaped from Her
Majesty's prison Belmarsh.

1663
01:50:12,125 --> 01:50:14,583
The notorious hitman is
almost certainly armed,

1664
01:50:14,666 --> 01:50:16,026
and considered
extremely dangerous.

01:57:09,958 --> 01:57:11,291
Okay. Stand by, Ryan.

1714
01:57:16,000 --> 01:57:17,458
Holding on the church bells.

01:57:26,291 --> 01:57:27,541
Sorry, Ryan.

1717
01:57:27,625 --> 01:57:28,985
Just waiting on
church bells, mate.

01:57:30,351 --> 01:57:31,631
Yeah. Where are

Where are they coming from?

01:57:33,916 --> 01:57:36,250
Still rolling.

All right, send Max,

1722
01:57:37,500 --> 01:57:39,041
send Max down, would you?

1723
01:57:43,625 --> 01:57:46,250
Max, go find out what the
fuck is going on down there.
