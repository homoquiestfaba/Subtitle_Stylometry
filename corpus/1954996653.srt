1
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:37,026
Magnificent, aren't they?

2
00:01:37,944 --> 00:01:39,779
God's tears.

3
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:43,658
Yeah.

4
00:01:44,242 --> 00:01:45,910
It's beautiful.

5
00:01:45,993 --> 00:01:47,829
So are the others.
I, uh...

6
00:01:49,205 --> 00:01:53,167
I guess I just...
have to make the right decision.

7
00:01:54,377 --> 00:01:57,088
In the end, it's not your eye
that must decide.

8
00:01:58,381 --> 00:01:59,531
Yeah.

9
00:02:10,435 --> 00:02:11,769
Did Rebecca call?

10
00:02:11,853 --> 00:02:15,106
Yeah. She'll be at the restaurant
in an hour to take you to the airport.

11
00:02:15,189 --> 00:02:18,693
I put your tickets, passport, and
your new cell phone in your briefcase

12
00:02:18,776 --> 00:02:20,403
and Hong will be there
in ten minutes.

13
00:02:20,486 --> 00:02:22,488
Thanks. See you in four days.

14
00:02:22,572 --> 00:02:23,740
The second you land,

15
00:02:23,781 --> 00:02:26,951
those guys are gonna start poking
and prodding to see what you're made of.

16
00:02:27,034 --> 00:02:29,036
Are you sure I'm the right guy
for this, Walter?

17
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:32,373
I'm no good at this corporate stuff,
I hate flying...

18
00:02:32,457 --> 00:02:34,083
And isn't this Bob's thing, anyway?

19
00:02:34,167 --> 00:02:36,502
Bob? Come on, you're gonna be fine.

20
00:02:36,586 --> 00:02:38,254
Just don't eat anything
that wears a collar,

21
00:02:38,296 --> 00:02:41,048
and if you need me, I'll be on the beach
in Cozumel screening my calls.

22
00:02:42,091 --> 00:02:45,052
Look... this is a big break for you.

23
00:02:45,136 --> 00:02:48,973
But I'm giving you this account because
I think you're the right man for the job.

24
00:02:49,057 --> 00:02:51,392
Besides, you're gonna be a member
of the family soon, right?

25
00:02:52,685 --> 00:02:53,936
Going down, please.

26
00:02:56,230 --> 00:02:58,900
Oh. Matthew, keep away
from the bang-bang girls

27
00:02:58,983 --> 00:03:00,777
or Rebecca will kick my ass, all right?

28
00:03:14,373 --> 00:03:15,523
Matty.

29
00:03:16,584 --> 00:03:18,961
- Matty!
- Luke! Hey, man.

30
00:03:19,045 --> 00:03:21,214
- How are you, man?
- I'm good. How are you?

31
00:03:21,297 --> 00:03:24,258
Really good. Really good.
Good to see you. You look great.

32
00:03:24,342 --> 00:03:26,010
Thanks, man. I mean, I do.

33
00:03:26,094 --> 00:03:28,262
You still doing that whole
advertising thing in New York?

34
00:03:28,888 --> 00:03:30,056
I moved back.

35
00:03:30,139 --> 00:03:32,308
- When did you get back?
- Two months ago.

36
00:03:32,392 --> 00:03:34,060
Two months? What are you doing?

37
00:03:34,143 --> 00:03:36,479
You don't call your friend?
You could've called me.

38
00:03:36,521 --> 00:03:39,524
I know. I just... I moved back
with a girl that I met in New York

39
00:03:39,607 --> 00:03:41,692
and I'm working for her brother,
and it's...

40
00:03:41,776 --> 00:03:43,486
That sounds serious.

41
00:03:44,445 --> 00:03:46,155
Maybe. I don't know.
We'll see.

42
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:48,574
You look very serious.
Look at you.

43
00:03:48,658 --> 00:03:49,992
I know, man.

44
00:03:50,034 --> 00:03:51,202
Hold on!

45
00:03:51,285 --> 00:03:53,329
Listen, man,

46
00:03:53,413 --> 00:03:55,581
Yeah, I need to probably
move my car, too.

47
00:03:55,665 --> 00:03:57,208
And then I'm going to China tonight.

48
00:03:57,291 --> 00:03:59,460
- China? That's weird.
- Yeah, I know.

49
00:03:59,544 --> 00:04:01,337
Let me give you a call
when I get back. Monday?

50
00:04:01,421 --> 00:04:03,256
Yeah, sounds good... shut up!

51
00:04:03,339 --> 00:04:07,385
All right, look, here's my card.
Don't wait two years... call me!

52
00:04:07,468 --> 00:04:08,618
The old shop.

53
00:04:08,678 --> 00:04:10,054
- All right?
- I will, man.

54
00:04:10,138 --> 00:04:11,639
You look good.
That's a nice tie.

55
00:04:11,723 --> 00:04:12,765
Good to see you.

56
00:04:12,849 --> 00:04:15,143
Are you done? Come on!

57
00:04:23,776 --> 00:04:26,738
He's very impressed
with what you've done,

58
00:04:26,779 --> 00:04:30,283
and he assures you
that when you get to China,

59
00:04:30,366 --> 00:04:33,619
you'll be met with much enthusiasm
and support.

60
00:04:33,703 --> 00:04:35,705
Thank you very much.

61
00:04:36,497 --> 00:04:39,167
Some champagne, please.
Excuse me.

62
00:04:46,591 --> 00:04:48,092
Excuse you.

63
00:04:48,968 --> 00:04:52,972
Matthew is a, uh, photographer.
Beautifully, wonderfully creative man.

64
00:04:53,056 --> 00:04:55,016
And here's my favorite sister.

65
00:04:55,099 --> 00:04:56,601
His only sister.

66
00:04:57,935 --> 00:05:00,980
Mr. Hong, Ms. Chin,
this is my sister Rebecca.

67
00:05:06,611 --> 00:05:08,112
Hey, Sweetie. How are you?

68
00:05:08,196 --> 00:05:09,363
As you can see,

69
00:05:09,447 --> 00:05:12,408
Matthew has managed to make himself
indispensable even away from the office.

70
00:05:17,455 --> 00:05:20,792
Here, Sweetie. Just take one of these,
to help you sleep on the plane.

71
00:05:20,875 --> 00:05:23,377
Mr. Hong would like
to propose a toast.

72
00:05:23,461 --> 00:05:24,611
Oh, yes.

73
00:05:27,381 --> 00:05:31,094
To a long and prosperous marriage...

74
00:05:31,135 --> 00:05:32,845
of our two companies.

75
00:05:32,929 --> 00:05:34,097
Are you okay?

76
00:05:34,138 --> 00:05:35,765
Yeah.

77
00:05:35,807 --> 00:05:38,351
Um, excuse me.

78
00:05:38,434 --> 00:05:39,602
I'll be right back.

79
00:05:40,686 --> 00:05:42,355
Excuse me,

80
00:06:01,207 --> 00:06:02,792
Just a minute!

81
00:06:02,875 --> 00:06:04,377
Sorry.

82
00:06:27,024 --> 00:06:29,694
No, you listen!
And I don't feel like calming down.

83
00:06:29,777 --> 00:06:32,780
It's over, okay?
That's why I wanted to meet.

84
00:06:34,699 --> 00:06:37,118
No, actually I don't think
it was an accident.

85
00:06:41,622 --> 00:06:42,790
It's in the paper!

86
00:06:45,168 --> 00:06:46,753
I don't ever want
to see you again, Daniel.

87
00:06:49,297 --> 00:06:52,008
Stop following me,
or I'll call the police!

88
00:06:54,218 --> 00:06:55,386
Lisa.

89
00:06:57,221 --> 00:06:58,389
Lisa!

90
00:07:01,434 --> 00:07:03,686
Whoa. Hey, come on.

91
00:07:04,687 --> 00:07:06,481
Are you all right?

92
00:07:07,607 --> 00:07:09,442
I pissed her off.

93
00:07:10,610 --> 00:07:12,820
You wanna put that
on this card, please?

94
00:07:50,149 --> 00:07:53,403
Oh! This stupid...

95
00:07:53,486 --> 00:07:54,987
Need some help there, Mare?

96
00:07:55,905 --> 00:07:57,865
- What's up?
- It's so frustrating.

97
00:07:57,949 --> 00:08:00,618
I just can't work out
why there's no sound.

98
00:08:00,701 --> 00:08:02,036
I just...

99
00:08:22,473 --> 00:08:24,767
Matthew? Hello?

100
00:08:25,935 --> 00:08:27,395
Anybody home?

101
00:08:28,771 --> 00:08:31,023
I'll take this one, if you want.

102
00:08:31,107 --> 00:08:32,692
Knock yourself out, kid.

103
00:08:58,551 --> 00:08:59,886
Oh, my God.

104
00:09:03,639 --> 00:09:04,789
Shit.

105
00:09:07,518 --> 00:09:10,521
- They wanna know how long... hey!
- Mary, I'll be right back.

106
00:09:10,605 --> 00:09:11,939
- Sorry.
- Where are you going?!

107
00:09:12,023 --> 00:09:13,173
Oh, sorry!

108
00:09:37,090 --> 00:09:39,258
- Hey, guys.
- Hey, Lisa.

109
00:09:39,342 --> 00:09:41,052
See you inside.

110
00:11:24,739 --> 00:11:25,889
Hey.

111
00:11:26,908 --> 00:11:28,058
Hey.

112
00:11:28,868 --> 00:11:31,037
- Probably time to go, right?
- Yes.

113
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:32,288
Okay.

114
00:11:38,002 --> 00:11:41,464
Pre-boarding call
for flight 752 to Munich.

115
00:11:41,547 --> 00:11:44,926
All passengers should board
at this time at gate 5-A

116
00:11:47,637 --> 00:11:49,597
I guess, uh, this is it.

117
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:51,808
Are you sure nothing's wrong?

118
00:11:51,891 --> 00:11:53,142
No. No, I'm fine.

119
00:11:53,226 --> 00:11:54,894
Okay. Well,
call me when you get there.

120
00:11:54,977 --> 00:11:56,437
Okay. I will.

121
00:11:56,521 --> 00:11:57,671
I love you.

122
00:11:58,523 --> 00:11:59,673
Me, too.

123
00:12:02,193 --> 00:12:03,236
Bye.

124
00:12:03,319 --> 00:12:04,469
Bye.

125
00:12:08,699 --> 00:12:09,849
Your attention. Please.

126
00:12:09,909 --> 00:12:14,247
This is the final boarding call
for American Airlines flight 153

127
00:12:14,330 --> 00:12:16,290
service to Shanghai.

128
00:12:16,374 --> 00:12:19,585
All passengers should now
be boarding at gate 10-B.

129
00:12:22,630 --> 00:12:25,800
Matthew Simon.
S-l-M-O-N.

130
00:12:29,053 --> 00:12:30,203
Shit.

131
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:33,307
Yeah.

132
00:12:34,851 --> 00:12:37,687
Yeah. No, he's not on the plane.

133
00:12:41,274 --> 00:12:42,424
He's...

134
00:12:44,485 --> 00:12:45,653
He's sick.

135
00:12:46,779 --> 00:12:49,866
No, he's very sick.
He has food poisoning.

136
00:12:50,825 --> 00:12:53,161
No, he'll be there

137
00:13:16,934 --> 00:13:18,084
Lisa?

138
00:13:27,195 --> 00:13:28,696
All right.

139
00:13:38,956 --> 00:13:40,792
Hello?

140
00:14:09,862 --> 00:14:11,030
Lisa?

141
00:14:54,282 --> 00:14:57,744
Here. Sweetie. Just take one of these
to help you sleep on the plane.

142
00:15:38,618 --> 00:15:42,455
That line... what it does to your calf...
That is what we call sexy.

143
00:15:43,414 --> 00:15:45,124
Wanna try pink? Hmm?

144
00:15:45,208 --> 00:15:47,043
- Okay.
- Okay. Have a seat.

145
00:15:47,126 --> 00:15:49,462
Hey. There you are.
Where you been?

146
00:15:49,545 --> 00:15:51,756
You look like shit.
I hope she was worth it.

147
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:54,842
Hey, do we have
a size ten in pink?

148
00:15:54,926 --> 00:15:56,427
Yeah, in the back.

149
00:15:56,511 --> 00:15:57,804
- Hey, Ellie.
- Hey.

150
00:15:57,887 --> 00:15:59,555
- I gotta talk to you.
- Lady Dragon Shoes.

151
00:15:59,597 --> 00:16:01,599
Ow. So, who is she?

152
00:16:02,642 --> 00:16:03,893
You wouldn't believe me.

153
00:16:03,976 --> 00:16:06,312
Betcha I do. I probably even know her.
What's her name?

154
00:16:07,647 --> 00:16:08,815
That's the thing.

155
00:16:10,149 --> 00:16:12,735
You don't know her name?
Oh, man.

156
00:16:12,819 --> 00:16:14,362
I know that she's a dancer.

157
00:16:14,987 --> 00:16:16,406
You mean, like a stripper?

158
00:16:16,447 --> 00:16:19,283
No, shithead.

159
00:16:19,367 --> 00:16:21,869
Oh, God.

160
00:16:21,953 --> 00:16:23,663
But her face is like...

161
00:16:23,746 --> 00:16:25,206
Her eyes...

162
00:16:26,833 --> 00:16:29,460
and her... skin is just...

163
00:16:30,711 --> 00:16:32,255
She just makes me all...

164
00:16:32,338 --> 00:16:37,260
What is "wha" and "duh"? She just
makes you more inarticulate than usual.

165
00:16:37,301 --> 00:16:40,388
You are obsessed,

166
00:16:40,471 --> 00:16:43,433
I mean, I don't know how

167
00:16:43,516 --> 00:16:46,477
I mean, my customer over there...
She's got great legs. Ellie.

168
00:16:46,561 --> 00:16:49,397
All right? There is
something hot about Ellie.

169
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:50,940
The blonde at the window.

170
00:16:51,023 --> 00:16:52,525
I mean, come on.

171
00:16:56,487 --> 00:16:57,655
What are you doing?

172
00:17:00,867 --> 00:17:02,118
Matty, are you all right?

173
00:17:02,201 --> 00:17:04,454
Lady Dragon Shoes.
Can I help you?

174
00:17:06,456 --> 00:17:08,332
The blonde?

175
00:17:14,005 --> 00:17:15,298
What are you doing?

176
00:17:15,339 --> 00:17:16,507
Give me some shoes.

177
00:17:16,591 --> 00:17:17,842
- Shoes?
- Yeah.

178
00:17:17,925 --> 00:17:19,177
Got lots of shoes.

179
00:17:25,767 --> 00:17:28,686
I'm sorry I took so long.
Pink. It's my last pair.

180
00:17:31,856 --> 00:17:33,524
Could I help you with anything?

181
00:17:35,026 --> 00:17:36,176
Yes.

182
00:17:37,570 --> 00:17:39,572
Those shoes in the window.

183
00:17:39,655 --> 00:17:41,491
The black ones
with the red sole.

184
00:17:41,532 --> 00:17:44,035
I'd like to try them on, please.

185
00:17:44,118 --> 00:17:45,912
The blacks and reds. Okay.

186
00:17:45,995 --> 00:17:48,539
I'll just go in the back
and get them for you.

187
00:17:49,707 --> 00:17:52,085
That's where we keep them...
In the back... so...

188
00:17:53,169 --> 00:17:54,337
I'll be right back.

189
00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:55,671
Uh, Matty?

190
00:17:55,755 --> 00:17:59,175
Maybe you'd like to ask the lady
what size shoe she wears.

191
00:17:59,217 --> 00:18:00,593
- Right.
- 8 1/2.

192
00:18:00,676 --> 00:18:02,512
Like Fellini.

193
00:18:02,553 --> 00:18:04,055
Right.

194
00:18:04,138 --> 00:18:09,560
I mean his movie, not his shoe size.

195
00:18:12,605 --> 00:18:13,773
8 1/2.

196
00:18:16,943 --> 00:18:17,944
Shit.

197
00:18:18,027 --> 00:18:19,237
What was that?

198
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:20,905
Fellini! What the hell
was I thinking?

199
00:18:20,988 --> 00:18:22,615
I have no idea.

200
00:18:22,698 --> 00:18:25,743
But you were right about one thing.
God, she's beautiful.

201
00:18:25,827 --> 00:18:28,830
And you, my man, are an idiot.

202
00:18:28,913 --> 00:18:31,249
All right, look.
Here's the thing, all right?

203
00:18:31,332 --> 00:18:33,626
You've obviously blown it,
she obviously hates you,

204
00:18:33,709 --> 00:18:35,878
so you stay right here
and let the man take a shot.

205
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:38,423
- Shut up. Give me the shoes.
- All right. Go.

206
00:18:38,464 --> 00:18:40,299
Just remember...
You're not funny.

207
00:18:46,806 --> 00:18:48,558
Here we go.
Black and red.

208
00:19:16,794 --> 00:19:18,129
What do you think?

209
00:19:20,089 --> 00:19:21,424
They're too big.

210
00:19:22,884 --> 00:19:24,218
Too big? Really?

211
00:19:25,094 --> 00:19:27,513
Luke, these are 91/2s.

212
00:19:28,139 --> 00:19:30,767
I'm sorry.
That's the smallest size we have.

213
00:19:30,850 --> 00:19:32,351
Oh, well. Too bad.

214
00:19:33,269 --> 00:19:35,730
Not... you know...
not necessarily.

215
00:19:35,813 --> 00:19:37,607
We can order these for you.

216
00:19:37,690 --> 00:19:40,485
Special order. And, uh...
I can, uh, if you leave your number,

217
00:19:40,568 --> 00:19:42,779
I can give you a call personally
when they come in.

218
00:19:42,820 --> 00:19:44,906
Do you normally spy on people?

219
00:19:46,991 --> 00:19:48,141
What?

220
00:19:49,327 --> 00:19:53,164
Are you really gonna tell me that
you're a huge fan of modern dance?

221
00:19:58,669 --> 00:20:02,924
Look, I've never done
anything like that before.

222
00:20:04,509 --> 00:20:08,805
Honestly... could you let me take you out
for a cup of coffee and explain?

223
00:20:08,888 --> 00:20:10,431
I don't think so.

224
00:20:10,515 --> 00:20:12,809
I'll stay on my side of the table.
I promise.

225
00:20:12,850 --> 00:20:15,061
Just call me
when the shoes come in, okay?

226
00:20:16,729 --> 00:20:18,981
Listen, I'm not what you
think I am. Ok?

227
00:20:25,947 --> 00:20:27,097
Shit.

228
00:20:36,791 --> 00:20:41,504
"Tomorrow night. 6:00.
Café Tangiers on Kinzie.

229
00:20:41,587 --> 00:20:43,589
Now you won't have to follow me."

230
00:21:04,569 --> 00:21:08,573
Well, my parents eventually split up,
and my mom moved back to Prague.

231
00:21:09,407 --> 00:21:11,826
But my dad's still here.
He lives in California.

232
00:21:13,786 --> 00:21:15,955
I wish I was in California right now.

233
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,377
So, why did you want
to become a photographer?

234
00:21:25,715 --> 00:21:26,966
Fish.

235
00:21:27,133 --> 00:21:28,384
Fish.

236
00:21:30,595 --> 00:21:32,263
Tropical fish, actually.

237
00:21:33,890 --> 00:21:38,811
When I was a kid, I used to go
to the library and pick out all the books...

238
00:21:39,645 --> 00:21:41,355
with tropical fish, you know.

239
00:21:41,439 --> 00:21:44,150
Beautiful colors and shapes.

240
00:21:44,233 --> 00:21:47,904
When I was eight years old, I realized
someone had to take pictures of the fish.

241
00:21:47,987 --> 00:21:49,739
And I wanted that to be me.

242
00:21:50,490 --> 00:21:54,327
But I grew up and I realized that...

243
00:21:54,410 --> 00:21:57,371
things don't have to be extraordinary
to be beautiful.

244
00:21:57,455 --> 00:21:59,791
The ordinary
could be just as beautiful.

245
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,794
Like what?

246
00:22:04,337 --> 00:22:05,487
Well...

247
00:22:06,089 --> 00:22:07,924
Like... you see the couple there?

248
00:22:09,217 --> 00:22:11,886
Look at the way the girl
is holding on to him so tight.

249
00:22:11,969 --> 00:22:14,180
But he can still drink his coffee.

250
00:22:14,263 --> 00:22:17,100
It looks like she feels safe
wrapped around him.

251
00:22:23,356 --> 00:22:25,691
And if you believe that,
I'll tell you another one.

252
00:22:33,408 --> 00:22:34,784
Take my picture.

253
00:22:36,202 --> 00:22:38,121
I feel beautiful tonight.

254
00:23:18,703 --> 00:23:19,853
Bye.

255
00:23:33,509 --> 00:23:34,659
Bye.

256
00:23:45,521 --> 00:23:46,671
Okay.

257
00:24:25,186 --> 00:24:26,854
- Hi.
- Hi.

258
00:25:26,497 --> 00:25:27,832
Ma'am?

259
00:25:27,915 --> 00:25:30,585
I have your dry cleaning.

260
00:25:32,253 --> 00:25:33,629
Shit.

261
00:26:08,873 --> 00:26:11,042
Hey, you're not in China.

262
00:26:11,125 --> 00:26:12,835
I didn't make it past O'Hare.

263
00:26:13,795 --> 00:26:15,588
- What happened?
- I found Lisa.

264
00:26:15,671 --> 00:26:17,256
Whoa.

265
00:26:24,222 --> 00:26:25,431
Here it is.

266
00:26:25,515 --> 00:26:27,350
This is the article she left behind.

267
00:26:28,142 --> 00:26:30,144
The funeral's today.

268
00:26:30,228 --> 00:26:32,271
I can't believe you're
blowing off Shanghai for this.

269
00:26:32,355 --> 00:26:34,690
This isn't actually Lisa.
This is a compact.

270
00:26:34,732 --> 00:26:36,943
What about your woman?
What's her name, anyway?

271
00:26:37,026 --> 00:26:38,194
Rebecca.

272
00:26:38,236 --> 00:26:39,904
Yeah, I mean, isn't...

273
00:26:41,447 --> 00:26:42,782
Shit.

274
00:26:44,242 --> 00:26:45,410
Is it broke?

275
00:26:46,994 --> 00:26:48,162
You superstitious?

276
00:26:48,246 --> 00:26:50,289
God, I am so stupid.
Here, give it to me...

277
00:26:50,373 --> 00:26:52,333
- No, no. It's okay.
- I'm sorry.

278
00:26:52,417 --> 00:26:55,086
You're right.
This doesn't make any sense.

279
00:26:55,169 --> 00:26:57,839
One minute I'm looking at rings,
and the next I'm here, doing this.

280
00:26:57,922 --> 00:27:00,716
Whoa.
Whoa, looking at rings?

281
00:27:00,758 --> 00:27:03,177
I didn't realize you were that serious.

282
00:27:03,261 --> 00:27:04,595
Apparently, I'm not.

283
00:27:05,179 --> 00:27:08,141
See, that's how the universe works.

284
00:27:08,224 --> 00:27:11,394
The minute you make a decision...
You decide on anything...

285
00:27:11,436 --> 00:27:13,688
Along comes temptation.

286
00:27:14,564 --> 00:27:15,940
What would you do?

287
00:27:17,483 --> 00:27:21,404
Keep them both and hope they didn't find
out about each other is what I would do.

288
00:27:21,487 --> 00:27:23,823
That's perfect.
Asshole.

289
00:27:28,995 --> 00:27:31,247
I have to find out why she left.

290
00:27:31,330 --> 00:27:33,166
She got scared.
Everyone gets scared.

291
00:27:33,249 --> 00:27:36,836
No, not Lisa. She wouldn't have
left without an explanation.

292
00:27:36,919 --> 00:27:39,589
Without some sort of letter
or a call or something.

293
00:27:39,630 --> 00:27:41,591
She's not like that.

294
00:27:41,632 --> 00:27:44,135
Something must've happened,
and whatever it was...

295
00:27:44,218 --> 00:27:46,554
Screwed you up big time.

296
00:27:51,559 --> 00:27:52,935
I know she loved me.

297
00:27:54,479 --> 00:27:56,481
So let me borrow
your keys, okay?

298
00:27:57,648 --> 00:27:58,798
Why?

299
00:27:59,817 --> 00:28:02,320
The funeral's today.
It's the only lead I've got.

300
00:28:02,403 --> 00:28:04,280
Oh... my car.

301
00:28:04,989 --> 00:28:07,366
- Come on.
- Okay. I know. I'm sorry.

302
00:28:07,450 --> 00:28:09,410
You just have to be back by 7:00.

303
00:28:09,494 --> 00:28:10,828
I will. Thank you.

304
00:28:10,912 --> 00:28:12,246
I've got a date.

305
00:28:14,290 --> 00:28:15,958
You got a date?

306
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,168
Yeah, I got a date.

307
00:28:18,002 --> 00:28:19,152
With who?

308
00:28:19,212 --> 00:28:22,799
This actress that came into my shop
a couple weeks ago, and, uh...

309
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:26,594
God, I like her a lot,

310
00:28:26,677 --> 00:28:29,764
I won't be. 6:00.
I'll be back by 6:00, okay?

311
00:28:36,896 --> 00:28:39,565
"Lisa. I've been trying to find you.

312
00:28:39,649 --> 00:28:42,193
I have your powder case.
Call me at..."

313
00:28:47,031 --> 00:28:48,074
Excuse me?

314
00:28:48,157 --> 00:28:50,076
What can I do for you?

315
00:28:52,370 --> 00:28:54,747
I found a hotel key
in the back yesterday.

316
00:28:54,831 --> 00:28:56,874
A woman left it.
I don't know if you saw her.

317
00:28:57,792 --> 00:29:00,920
She fell right over there.
Broke her heel.

318
00:29:01,003 --> 00:29:02,964
Yesterday?
Yeah, that's right. I remember.

319
00:29:03,047 --> 00:29:05,133
You wanted to leave
the keys with me?

320
00:29:05,216 --> 00:29:07,135
No. Actually, I, uh...

321
00:29:07,218 --> 00:29:09,512
could you give her this note
if she comes back in here?

322
00:29:09,595 --> 00:29:11,180
- No problem.
- Thanks a lot.

323
00:29:11,264 --> 00:29:12,414
Sure.

324
00:30:16,245 --> 00:30:17,395
Lisa!

325
00:30:19,123 --> 00:30:20,273
Lisa!

326
00:31:28,776 --> 00:31:31,779
"Lisa. I returned your key
as you asked.

327
00:31:31,863 --> 00:31:35,324
"You must let me see you
if only for one last time.

328
00:31:35,408 --> 00:31:37,910
"Call me.
My heart can't stand it.

329
00:31:38,661 --> 00:31:40,997
All my love. Daniel."

330
00:32:55,446 --> 00:32:56,596
Shit.

331
00:33:23,975 --> 00:33:25,643
- Ass.
- I'm so sorry.

332
00:33:25,727 --> 00:33:27,895
- Hey, I could explain.
- You are an asshole.

333
00:33:27,979 --> 00:33:30,106
Do me a favor...
Don't ask me for any more favors.

334
00:33:30,189 --> 00:33:31,858
Come on.
Luke...

335
00:33:33,317 --> 00:33:35,820
I found her. I think I found her.
I found her apartment, anyway.

336
00:33:35,903 --> 00:33:37,572
I'm really happy for you, Matty.

337
00:33:37,655 --> 00:33:40,616
I left a note under her door
to meet me at the park tomorrow.

338
00:33:40,658 --> 00:33:42,952
Guess you guys
should have a picnic.

339
00:33:43,035 --> 00:33:45,079
Jesus, man.

340
00:33:45,163 --> 00:33:47,623
My entire evening is screwed.

341
00:33:47,665 --> 00:33:49,709
Look, I'm not really
that late, brother.

342
00:33:49,792 --> 00:33:53,755
Alex doesn't wait for anyone. Trust me.
I've already left three messages.

343
00:33:54,505 --> 00:33:56,132
Well, why didn't you take a cab?

344
00:33:56,215 --> 00:33:59,051
'Cause I was waiting for you.
I was waiting for my car.

345
00:33:59,969 --> 00:34:02,555
Luke, it's not that late.

346
00:34:02,638 --> 00:34:05,892
Go over there? And do what?
Throw little pebbles up at her window?

347
00:34:06,642 --> 00:34:09,312
She's gone. It's over.
Just forget it.

348
00:34:11,355 --> 00:34:12,505
Maybe not.

349
00:34:17,820 --> 00:34:20,490
I hope, for our friendship,
this is who I want it to be.

350
00:34:20,531 --> 00:34:22,658
Want to see how cool I am?
Three rings.

351
00:34:25,411 --> 00:34:26,746
Hello?

352
00:34:26,829 --> 00:34:28,748
Hey, how's it goin'?

353
00:34:28,831 --> 00:34:31,501
Oh, I'm so sorry.
Did you get my messages?

354
00:34:32,502 --> 00:34:36,214
No, I lent my car to my buddy Matt,
and he was a little late coming home.

355
00:34:37,548 --> 00:34:40,384
No, sure. He's right here.
Hold on a sec.

356
00:34:40,468 --> 00:34:41,803
She wants to talk to you.

357
00:34:42,845 --> 00:34:45,181
Fix it.
You have to fix it.

358
00:34:48,893 --> 00:34:50,043
Hello?

359
00:34:50,645 --> 00:34:52,814
He's full of shit. Isn't he?

360
00:34:52,897 --> 00:34:54,899
Yeah, he's full of shit, all right.

361
00:34:54,982 --> 00:34:56,317
Yeah. I knew it.

362
00:34:57,693 --> 00:35:01,406
He didn't lend me his car. I took it.

363
00:35:01,489 --> 00:35:02,740
I stole his keys.

364
00:35:02,824 --> 00:35:04,325
That's good.

365
00:35:04,409 --> 00:35:05,910
Why would you do that?

366
00:35:07,662 --> 00:35:09,163
Because I'm a selfish idiot.

367
00:35:10,456 --> 00:35:13,292
And I had this whole thing
going on that...

368
00:35:14,419 --> 00:35:16,003
I don't wanna bore you with it.

369
00:35:16,087 --> 00:35:17,237
Please. I insist.

370
00:35:18,798 --> 00:35:19,948
Okay.

371
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:22,969
Well, um...

372
00:35:23,928 --> 00:35:27,056
I was looking for somebody.
A woman.

373
00:35:28,141 --> 00:35:29,308
I wasn't thinking.

374
00:35:29,392 --> 00:35:31,227
Got a little desperate.

375
00:35:31,269 --> 00:35:33,104
Oh. I'm sorry.

376
00:35:33,187 --> 00:35:34,355
No.

377
00:35:34,439 --> 00:35:36,357
I should be apologizing to you.

378
00:35:37,442 --> 00:35:41,070
And I am apologizing to you.
I'm very sorry that I ruined your evening.

379
00:35:41,863 --> 00:35:43,197
Did you find her?

380
00:35:44,532 --> 00:35:47,577
I think so. Yeah.
I found where she lives.

381
00:35:47,660 --> 00:35:49,996
Well. You should go back.
And you should look for her.

382
00:35:50,788 --> 00:35:52,081
I think I will. Thanks.

383
00:35:52,165 --> 00:35:53,833
You're boring now.
Give me the phone.

384
00:35:53,916 --> 00:35:55,585
- Okay, Alex. I gotta go.
- Nice to talk to you.

385
00:35:55,626 --> 00:35:57,462
Nice to talk to you, too.
Bye-bye.

386
00:35:58,087 --> 00:35:59,338
She's nice, man.

387
00:35:59,422 --> 00:36:00,572
Thanks.

388
00:36:01,299 --> 00:36:02,449
Hello?

389
00:36:07,805 --> 00:36:10,683
Okay. Why don't I just...
I'll pick you up at the theater.

390
00:36:27,283 --> 00:36:29,619
I think not so, my lord.

391
00:36:29,660 --> 00:36:31,662
Dear lad, believe it,

392
00:36:31,746 --> 00:36:36,250
for they shall yet belie thy happy years
to say thou art a man.

393
00:36:36,334 --> 00:36:37,484
Prosper well in this,

394
00:36:37,543 --> 00:36:40,171
and thou shalt live as freely as thy lord
to call his fortunes thine.

395
00:36:40,254 --> 00:36:42,632
I'll do my best to woo your lady...

396
00:36:43,299 --> 00:36:45,134
and yet a barful strife.

397
00:36:45,176 --> 00:36:47,929
Whoe'er I woo, myself
would be his wife.

398
00:36:48,012 --> 00:36:50,264
Alex, what's going on?

399
00:36:52,350 --> 00:36:53,500
What do you mean?

400
00:36:53,559 --> 00:36:56,062
Well, I'm sitting in the audience
and I'm getting nothing.

401
00:36:56,729 --> 00:36:59,899
I figured maybe I'm missing something,
so I come, I take a closer look.

402
00:36:59,982 --> 00:37:02,110
But you know what?
I'm still not buying it.

403
00:37:02,193 --> 00:37:04,237
What the hell's
the matter with you today?

404
00:37:05,655 --> 00:37:09,367
Look, the line, "Whoe'er I woo,

405
00:37:09,450 --> 00:37:11,285
defines your character.

406
00:37:11,369 --> 00:37:12,745
You're in love with this guy,

407
00:37:12,829 --> 00:37:16,499
and he is asking you
to help him get another woman!

408
00:37:16,541 --> 00:37:20,670
You're upset, you're confused,
it's tearing you up inside!

409
00:37:20,711 --> 00:37:23,714
We've gotta see the love,
but we've also gotta see the agony.

410
00:37:24,549 --> 00:37:26,509
You have been in love before,

411
00:37:29,470 --> 00:37:31,180
Yes. Sure.

412
00:37:31,264 --> 00:37:35,017
Oh, good. Well, please,
share a little something with us, huh?

413
00:37:36,894 --> 00:37:41,274
God. You sound so close.
Can't believe you're 7.000 miles away.

414
00:37:41,357 --> 00:37:42,942
I know.
It's crazy, isn't it?

415
00:37:44,110 --> 00:37:45,778
How's the weather?

416
00:37:45,862 --> 00:37:47,822
I don't know.
It's still dark out.

417
00:37:47,905 --> 00:37:50,241
Isn't it. Like.
10: 00 in the morning there?

418
00:37:52,076 --> 00:37:53,411
I... you know what?

419
00:37:53,494 --> 00:37:57,331
I'm so zonked, I didn't

420
00:37:57,373 --> 00:38:00,793
you know what... it's actually a really
nice day out, now that I see it.

421
00:38:00,877 --> 00:38:02,712
Are you sure nothing's wrong?

422
00:38:03,588 --> 00:38:05,923
No. I'm just a little out of it,
that's all.

423
00:38:06,007 --> 00:38:09,594
Well. You better get in it. Because
today's meeting is very important.

424
00:38:09,677 --> 00:38:12,346
You'll be fine. Honey.
I'll speak to you later. Okay?

425
00:38:12,388 --> 00:38:14,223
I miss you.
Bye.

426
00:38:14,307 --> 00:38:15,641
Bye.

427
00:38:45,213 --> 00:38:48,049
"Lisa. I found your powder case.

428
00:38:48,132 --> 00:38:49,425
"I have to see you.

429
00:38:50,301 --> 00:38:52,762
"Meet me tomorrow at 3: 00.
Our usual spot.

430
00:38:53,805 --> 00:38:54,955
Matt."

431
00:40:06,377 --> 00:40:07,527
Hello?

432
00:40:17,138 --> 00:40:18,288
Lisa?

433
00:41:22,453 --> 00:41:23,603
Fuck.

434
00:42:30,021 --> 00:42:31,314
Lisa?

435
00:42:41,199 --> 00:42:43,659
Jesus Christ!
I'm sorry. It's okay.

436
00:42:43,701 --> 00:42:45,495
I'm calling the police!
Where's the phone?

437
00:42:45,578 --> 00:42:48,039
No! Don't call the police!
I'm not gonna hurt you.

438
00:42:48,122 --> 00:42:50,583
- Get away from me!
- Okay! Okay! Calm down!

439
00:42:50,666 --> 00:42:52,543
Calm down. It's okay.

440
00:42:52,627 --> 00:42:54,128
I'm a friend of Lisa's.

441
00:42:54,796 --> 00:42:56,255
A friend of Lisa's?

442
00:42:56,339 --> 00:42:57,507
Yeah.

443
00:42:57,548 --> 00:42:59,175
Is that supposed to be funny?

444
00:42:59,258 --> 00:43:02,929
No. You can ask her
when she comes, okay?

445
00:43:03,012 --> 00:43:05,890
I'm Lisa.
I live here.

446
00:43:09,185 --> 00:43:10,353
Your name's Lisa?

447
00:43:10,395 --> 00:43:11,545
Yeah.

448
00:43:14,273 --> 00:43:15,691
And you live here?

449
00:43:15,733 --> 00:43:17,068
Yeah.

450
00:43:19,987 --> 00:43:21,137
No...

451
00:43:23,950 --> 00:43:25,785
- I'm calling the cops.
- No, wait. Don't.

452
00:43:27,537 --> 00:43:29,122
Hey, you see that letter there?

453
00:43:32,083 --> 00:43:34,252
- You wrote that?
- Yeah.

454
00:43:35,128 --> 00:43:37,130
You were at Bellucci's on Monday.

455
00:43:39,132 --> 00:43:41,134
Yeah... I was.

456
00:43:41,217 --> 00:43:43,761
And you had a room at The Drake,
room 679?

457
00:43:44,846 --> 00:43:45,996
Yeah.

458
00:43:46,723 --> 00:43:48,307
How'd you know that?

459
00:43:54,647 --> 00:43:56,232
I can't believe I did this.

460
00:43:57,150 --> 00:43:59,193
I'm going crazy. Here.

461
00:44:00,153 --> 00:44:01,821
That's yours.

462
00:44:04,115 --> 00:44:05,265
It's broken.

463
00:44:06,117 --> 00:44:08,786
I'd be happy to pay for it.
You know, my bad luck.

464
00:44:09,370 --> 00:44:10,520
Wait.

465
00:44:11,706 --> 00:44:12,874
Your hand.

466
00:44:13,708 --> 00:44:14,959
It's bleeding.

467
00:44:16,210 --> 00:44:17,920
It's all right.

468
00:44:18,755 --> 00:44:19,797
I got this.

469
00:44:19,881 --> 00:44:23,217
No, I...

470
00:44:27,138 --> 00:44:28,288
Okay.

471
00:44:28,931 --> 00:44:30,081
Thank you.

472
00:44:33,811 --> 00:44:35,146
You know, at the restaurant,

473
00:44:35,229 --> 00:44:37,732
I would've bet anything
you were this girl I used to know.

474
00:44:41,110 --> 00:44:45,073
But now seeing you here, you don't
really look that much like her at all.

475
00:44:47,283 --> 00:44:48,493
Must be hallucinating.

476
00:44:51,204 --> 00:44:52,747
I was crazy about her.

477
00:44:58,878 --> 00:45:02,465
So, what about the, uh...

478
00:45:02,548 --> 00:45:05,551
- Daniel.
- Yeah. What's his story?

479
00:45:08,763 --> 00:45:10,765
He's been stalking me.

480
00:45:10,807 --> 00:45:13,643
He scares the hell out of me.

481
00:45:13,726 --> 00:45:18,064
That's why I was staying in the hotel...
Because I didn't want him to find me.

482
00:45:19,524 --> 00:45:21,192
I hope he didn't follow you here.

483
00:45:23,444 --> 00:45:25,029
I don't think so. No.

484
00:45:26,239 --> 00:45:27,782
How's your hand?

485
00:45:28,741 --> 00:45:30,243
It's okay.

486
00:45:30,326 --> 00:45:32,537
I wasn't even hungry or anything.

487
00:45:33,830 --> 00:45:35,081
Actually, you know what?

488
00:45:36,124 --> 00:45:37,458
Thank you for everything.

489
00:45:38,292 --> 00:45:39,442
For the bandage...

490
00:45:41,170 --> 00:45:42,964
not calling the cops...

491
00:45:43,548 --> 00:45:47,051
not beating me to death
with the little bronze ballerina, or...

492
00:45:49,721 --> 00:45:51,139
You're leaving?

493
00:45:52,181 --> 00:45:53,331
Yeah.

494
00:45:54,851 --> 00:45:56,310
I'm late, you know.

495
00:45:57,395 --> 00:46:00,690
Very late, actually, for China, so...

496
00:46:01,774 --> 00:46:03,776
China. That's funny.

497
00:46:04,861 --> 00:46:06,529
That's what my friend said, too.

498
00:46:09,449 --> 00:46:11,117
Well, maybe you should wait.

499
00:46:12,034 --> 00:46:15,329
I can't. I mean...
I gotta go.

500
00:46:15,371 --> 00:46:19,208
Do you really think planes
are still taking off this late?

501
00:46:25,089 --> 00:46:26,883
What are you doing?

502
00:46:30,094 --> 00:46:31,262
I'm scared.

503
00:46:32,305 --> 00:46:33,556
Of him.

504
00:46:34,849 --> 00:46:38,519
I haven't stayed alone here
since his wife died, and...

505
00:46:40,938 --> 00:46:42,440
Would you mind if you stayed?

506
00:46:45,735 --> 00:46:48,571
Lisa, you don't even know me.
I broke into your apartment...

507
00:46:48,654 --> 00:46:50,490
I know. I know. I know.

508
00:46:50,573 --> 00:46:54,410
But... don't take this the wrong way,
but I just think you're a nice guy.

509
00:46:54,494 --> 00:46:55,828
That's all.

510
00:47:03,795 --> 00:47:04,945
Okay.

511
00:47:06,964 --> 00:47:08,049
Good.

512
00:47:08,091 --> 00:47:09,759
Where does a nice guy sleep?

513
00:47:10,593 --> 00:47:13,179
A nice guy sleeps on the couch.

514
00:47:52,260 --> 00:47:53,594
What are you doing?

515
00:47:54,971 --> 00:47:56,305
I'm watching you sleep.

516
00:48:30,673 --> 00:48:31,823
Lisa!

517
00:48:41,684 --> 00:48:43,352
Hey, how are you?

518
00:48:44,062 --> 00:48:45,730
What are you doing here?

519
00:48:45,813 --> 00:48:47,148
I gotta talk to you.

520
00:48:48,066 --> 00:48:49,525
Now?

521
00:48:49,609 --> 00:48:51,277
Yeah, it's kind of important.

522
00:48:52,111 --> 00:48:54,947
Wanna go get a drink or something?
It's freezing out here.

523
00:48:55,031 --> 00:48:56,866
- Okay.
- Okay? Come on.

524
00:48:58,493 --> 00:49:04,123
My friend gave my stuff
to this head of the agency, and...

525
00:49:04,207 --> 00:49:05,374
he liked it.

526
00:49:05,416 --> 00:49:06,793
So...

527
00:49:06,876 --> 00:49:08,920
he offered me a job in New York.

528
00:49:09,003 --> 00:49:11,089
That's great.

529
00:49:13,424 --> 00:49:15,802
It'll help me pay my rent, but...

530
00:49:15,885 --> 00:49:17,720
But what? Why not?

531
00:49:19,180 --> 00:49:20,330
Move in with me.

532
00:49:23,768 --> 00:49:27,230
I... I know it's only been
a couple of months, but I just, um...

533
00:49:28,439 --> 00:49:30,525
You're the reason
I don't wanna move to New York.

534
00:49:31,984 --> 00:49:33,903
I wanna make my life
here with you.

535
00:49:36,864 --> 00:49:41,202
Look, I'm really late for rehearsal.
Can we talk about this tomorrow?

536
00:49:45,164 --> 00:49:46,314
Sure.

537
00:49:47,208 --> 00:49:49,585
Matthew, trust me, okay?

538
00:49:49,627 --> 00:49:52,130
Just meet me tomorrow
in the park. Same time.

539
00:49:54,757 --> 00:49:55,907
Bye.

540
00:50:31,210 --> 00:50:32,962
Have you seen Lisa?

541
00:50:33,004 --> 00:50:34,297
Lisa?

542
00:50:34,338 --> 00:50:36,340
She's gone on a European tour
of Cabaret.

543
00:50:37,175 --> 00:50:38,342
It all happened real fast.

544
00:50:38,426 --> 00:50:41,596
They came to our rehearsal and
just picked her out, and she was gone.

545
00:50:43,347 --> 00:50:47,685
Like... did she say anything
before she left?

546
00:50:48,394 --> 00:50:49,544
Like what?

547
00:50:50,563 --> 00:50:51,713
Like, uh...

548
00:50:55,276 --> 00:50:56,652
Cool. Thanks.

549
00:50:56,736 --> 00:50:57,886
Okay.

550
00:52:43,259 --> 00:52:44,409
- Hi.
- Hi.

551
00:52:54,437 --> 00:52:56,105
You want a cup of coffee?

552
00:52:56,189 --> 00:52:57,857
Yeah, sure. Thanks.

553
00:53:19,212 --> 00:53:20,362
No.

554
00:53:21,130 --> 00:53:22,280
No.

555
00:53:25,927 --> 00:53:27,077
No.

556
00:53:27,887 --> 00:53:29,037
Yeah.

557
00:53:38,981 --> 00:53:40,691
He broke all my cups.

558
00:53:42,902 --> 00:53:44,070
That's original.

559
00:53:47,907 --> 00:53:49,492
Sugar?

560
00:53:49,575 --> 00:53:51,035
Thanks. Yeah.

561
00:53:58,459 --> 00:53:59,609
Thank you.

562
00:54:00,253 --> 00:54:01,403
To us.

563
00:54:26,487 --> 00:54:27,637
Leaving?

564
00:54:28,239 --> 00:54:30,491
Yeah. I have to go to work.

565
00:54:31,784 --> 00:54:33,161
I'm due at the hospital.

566
00:54:34,370 --> 00:54:35,872
That's right.
You're a nurse.

567
00:54:35,955 --> 00:54:37,665
I got a double shift.

568
00:54:44,505 --> 00:54:46,382
You should stay.

569
00:54:50,303 --> 00:54:51,721
You have a key?

570
00:54:51,804 --> 00:54:52,954
Yeah.

571
00:54:54,182 --> 00:54:55,975
Well, I should be back by 10:00.

572
00:54:57,935 --> 00:54:59,520
Will I see you later?

573
00:55:01,939 --> 00:55:03,089
Maybe.

574
00:55:04,108 --> 00:55:05,258
Yeah.

575
00:55:13,785 --> 00:55:15,119
- Bye.
- Bye.

576
00:55:27,340 --> 00:55:29,217
You were at Bellucci's on Monday.

577
00:55:30,843 --> 00:55:33,262
Yeah. I was.

578
00:55:37,850 --> 00:55:39,000
Hello?

579
00:55:39,852 --> 00:55:41,354
What happened to you?

580
00:55:43,147 --> 00:55:45,483
Hang on.
Just a minute!

581
00:55:46,192 --> 00:55:48,653
Look, could I stay at your place
for a couple of days?

582
00:55:48,736 --> 00:55:50,571
- Yeah. Of course.
- Great.

583
00:55:50,655 --> 00:55:53,324
Well, I've gotta call Daniel first,
then I'll be right over.

584
00:55:53,366 --> 00:55:54,700
- Okay.
- Bye.

585
00:56:04,001 --> 00:56:05,151
Lisa!

586
00:56:08,256 --> 00:56:10,007
Oh, shit. Get up.

587
00:57:18,409 --> 00:57:19,786
You know.
At the restaurant.

588
00:57:19,869 --> 00:57:22,371
I would've bet anything
you were this girl I used to know.

589
00:57:23,289 --> 00:57:27,293
But now seeing you here. You don't
really look that much like her at all.

590
00:58:00,493 --> 00:58:01,869
Hi.

591
00:58:25,977 --> 00:58:28,813
Come on, Lisa.

592
00:58:29,856 --> 00:58:32,525
Don't start shit like that.
Look, I don't have time...

593
00:58:32,608 --> 00:58:34,277
I don't wanna talk about it anymore.

594
00:58:34,360 --> 00:58:36,988
Stop acting like a goddamn child
about this crap!

595
00:58:37,029 --> 00:58:38,990
Stop screaming at me!

596
00:58:39,031 --> 00:58:42,493
Lisa, what are you doing?
Jesus Christ. Be careful.

597
00:58:42,577 --> 00:58:45,037
It's over. Get out of my house.

598
00:58:45,079 --> 00:58:46,956
Stop! Enough!

599
00:58:47,039 --> 00:58:48,875
Get back in here now!

600
00:58:48,958 --> 00:58:51,127
- You're gonna kill yourself!
- Don't do it!

601
00:58:51,210 --> 00:58:52,837
Lisa, stop this!

602
00:58:53,421 --> 00:58:56,174
Is this how you deal
with your problems?

603
00:58:56,257 --> 00:58:58,593
Huh? You run away
and act like a child?

604
00:58:58,676 --> 00:59:01,679
Go home, and don't bother calling me! Ok?

605
00:59:01,721 --> 00:59:02,805
Hi.

606
00:59:02,889 --> 00:59:04,390
- Goddamnit!
- Can I come in?

607
00:59:04,474 --> 00:59:05,725
Of course.

608
00:59:07,810 --> 00:59:09,979
I'm sorry.
I hate to bother you, but, um,

609
00:59:10,063 --> 00:59:14,567
my... ex-boyfriend just told me
he's seeing someone else.

610
00:59:14,650 --> 00:59:16,486
I took a chance.
I hope you don't mind.

611
00:59:16,569 --> 00:59:17,987
No, not at all.

612
00:59:18,071 --> 00:59:20,114
Lisa, this is stupid, all right?
Come on!

613
00:59:20,198 --> 00:59:21,741
Go home!

614
00:59:25,036 --> 00:59:27,413
Excuse me, are you leaving?
I'd like to park.

615
00:59:43,805 --> 00:59:45,473
- Hey!
- Hey.

616
00:59:51,646 --> 00:59:53,606
I'm sorry I didn't call.
I, um...

617
00:59:54,399 --> 00:59:56,526
Don't worry.
I've just been thinking.

618
00:59:57,693 --> 00:59:59,028
Are you okay?

619
01:00:01,114 --> 01:00:02,657
I'm going to London.

620
01:00:02,740 --> 01:00:04,075
Why?

621
01:00:04,992 --> 01:00:07,161
A friend of mine
started his own company.

622
01:00:07,245 --> 01:00:08,746
He's asked me to choreograph.

623
01:00:08,788 --> 01:00:11,791
Oh, my God.
That's amazing.

624
01:00:11,874 --> 01:00:13,543
When do you leave?

625
01:00:13,626 --> 01:00:14,961
Tomorrow afternoon.

626
01:00:15,002 --> 01:00:16,963
Is it okay
if I stay another night?

627
01:00:17,004 --> 01:00:18,172
Of course.

628
01:00:18,256 --> 01:00:20,299
No, it has to be tonight.

629
01:00:20,383 --> 01:00:23,219
Well, then I'd say
the 10:15 flight to Los Angeles

630
01:00:23,302 --> 01:00:24,762
would be your best bet.

631
01:00:24,846 --> 01:00:27,014
You can catch the flight
to Shanghai from there.

632
01:00:27,098 --> 01:00:30,226
But there's only coach available;
Your ticket's for first.

633
01:00:30,309 --> 01:00:31,459
It's okay.

634
01:00:33,646 --> 01:00:34,796
I'll tell you what.

635
01:00:34,856 --> 01:00:36,858
I think I can get you an upgrade.

636
01:00:36,941 --> 01:00:39,610
Why don't you come back
in a few hours. Around 4:00.

637
01:00:39,652 --> 01:00:42,029
Something should've
opened up by then.

638
01:00:42,113 --> 01:00:43,263
Okay.

639
01:00:43,781 --> 01:00:45,616
Thank you.
See you at 4:00.

640
01:01:06,054 --> 01:01:08,056
The hotel thing was just stupid.

641
01:01:09,223 --> 01:01:11,392
I knew Daniel would find me.

642
01:01:14,687 --> 01:01:15,837
So...

643
01:01:18,024 --> 01:01:19,442
Why don't you come with me?

644
01:01:23,071 --> 01:01:26,324
Well, I've got great shifts
at the hospital now,

645
01:01:26,365 --> 01:01:28,868
and, you know...

646
01:01:28,951 --> 01:01:30,620
And the guy who gave you that.

647
01:01:31,412 --> 01:01:33,247
Yeah.

648
01:01:36,542 --> 01:01:38,377
Well, come on. Tell me!

649
01:01:40,296 --> 01:01:44,342
Last night we did it
on the sofa in the doctor's lounge.

650
01:01:44,425 --> 01:01:46,344
You little slut.
I'm jealous!

651
01:01:46,385 --> 01:01:48,888
The bad part is
I'm already seeing his best friend.

652
01:01:49,847 --> 01:01:51,224
Another surgeon.

653
01:01:52,058 --> 01:01:56,104
He's adorable and he adores me,

654
01:01:56,437 --> 01:02:01,526
So she had the same name,

655
01:02:01,567 --> 01:02:03,569
That's so hot.

656
01:02:03,653 --> 01:02:06,447
Or... or maybe this is creepy.

657
01:02:06,531 --> 01:02:08,699
I think it's a little bit of both, actually.

658
01:02:09,909 --> 01:02:11,059
So, did you hit it?

659
01:02:12,870 --> 01:02:16,541
No. Um... I slept on the couch,
you know.

660
01:02:16,582 --> 01:02:18,418
When I woke up
in the morning, she was gone.

661
01:02:18,501 --> 01:02:20,420
- But you wanted to hit it, didn't you?
- Come on.

662
01:02:20,503 --> 01:02:21,546
Come on.

663
01:02:21,629 --> 01:02:25,258
I'm going to China tonight, I'm practically
engaged... do I need to remind you?

664
01:02:25,341 --> 01:02:27,051
The lies we tell ourselves.

665
01:02:29,262 --> 01:02:31,514
So, what about you and Alex...
How's that?

666
01:02:31,597 --> 01:02:33,057
How was your date?

667
01:02:34,434 --> 01:02:36,769
- It was great.
- Good.

668
01:02:36,853 --> 01:02:38,896
I mean, what...

669
01:02:39,772 --> 01:02:41,065
I don't know. Sure.

670
01:02:42,942 --> 01:02:46,946
Well. After I left you. I went
to pick up Alex from the theater. Right?

671
01:02:47,697 --> 01:02:52,034
She has this director... the guy is
such a cheese ball. Not that impressive.

672
01:02:52,118 --> 01:02:56,247
I mean. She should be on Broadway
or something. 'Cause she was awesome.

673
01:02:56,289 --> 01:02:59,041
It was super late
by the time she got changed.

674
01:03:23,274 --> 01:03:26,944
So we went out.
Had a couple drinks and a couple laughs.

675
01:03:26,986 --> 01:03:30,656
On the way home. I told her the whole
sordid story about you and Lisa.

676
01:03:30,740 --> 01:03:32,909
So now, finally, he's found her.

677
01:03:34,327 --> 01:03:35,953
- Wow.
- Yeah.

678
01:03:37,997 --> 01:03:40,875
And did she explain
why she disappeared?

679
01:03:40,958 --> 01:03:42,877
No, not yet.
He just wrote her this note.

680
01:03:42,960 --> 01:03:46,130
They haven't actually spoken,
but they're supposed to speak soon.

681
01:03:53,388 --> 01:03:54,538
You okay?

682
01:03:57,683 --> 01:04:01,604
No, I'm not. You know, I don't...

683
01:04:03,147 --> 01:04:04,315
You're kidding me.

684
01:04:05,149 --> 01:04:06,299
No.

685
01:04:06,943 --> 01:04:09,112
Do you mind just taking me home?

686
01:04:13,366 --> 01:04:14,700
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

687
01:04:15,493 --> 01:04:16,661
Thanks.

688
01:04:30,007 --> 01:04:33,678
So, I was thinking,
maybe I could go upstairs with you

689
01:04:33,719 --> 01:04:37,890
and I'll make you
a nice big cup of hot chocolate...

690
01:04:39,225 --> 01:04:41,352
put a bunch
of little marshmallows up on top.

691
01:04:41,436 --> 01:04:43,771
We'll watch TV and just hang out.

692
01:04:44,689 --> 01:04:46,274
Do you love me?

693
01:04:49,235 --> 01:04:50,987
I just wanna be alone.

694
01:04:52,405 --> 01:04:53,823
- Well...
- I'll call you.

695
01:04:53,906 --> 01:04:55,366
I'll call you tomorrow.

696
01:04:56,451 --> 01:04:58,703
Alex.
Alex, wait a second.

697
01:04:58,786 --> 01:05:00,246
You gotta be kidding me.

698
01:05:00,288 --> 01:05:02,373
This girl's unbelievable.

699
01:05:02,457 --> 01:05:04,041
You know what?
Don't call me, okay?

700
01:05:04,125 --> 01:05:06,919
Don't call me until you figure out
what you wanna do with your life,

701
01:05:07,003 --> 01:05:08,421
'cause I can't deal with this.

702
01:05:08,463 --> 01:05:11,132
Every time, it's a different story
with you, all right?

703
01:05:15,303 --> 01:05:16,804
Wait, I... I'm sorry.

704
01:05:17,638 --> 01:05:18,806
I'll call you tomorrow.

705
01:05:20,516 --> 01:05:21,684
God!

706
01:05:24,854 --> 01:05:28,191
This girl is ridiculous.

707
01:05:46,667 --> 01:05:47,835
Taxi!

708
01:06:00,640 --> 01:06:02,767
And we had sex all night.

709
01:06:02,809 --> 01:06:04,477
And the next morning.

710
01:06:04,560 --> 01:06:07,522
I made her my dad's
world-famous breakfast, and...

711
01:06:07,605 --> 01:06:09,273
I don't know.
It was pretty perfect.

712
01:06:10,900 --> 01:06:12,735
That sounds really good, man.

713
01:06:12,819 --> 01:06:13,969
It was pretty good.

714
01:06:14,028 --> 01:06:15,363
When do I get to meet her?

715
01:06:17,532 --> 01:06:18,682
Tonight.

716
01:06:19,492 --> 01:06:21,994
Yeah, tonight. Tonight is her...
She's got this play.

717
01:06:22,078 --> 01:06:24,580
It's the big opening.
It's Shakespeare.

718
01:06:25,331 --> 01:06:26,416
Shakespeare.

719
01:06:26,499 --> 01:06:29,585
Shakespeare. I know.
But it's supposed to be good. Trust me.

720
01:06:31,879 --> 01:06:33,464
I'm supposed to leave tonight.

721
01:06:33,548 --> 01:06:34,715
Yeah, but it's early.

722
01:06:34,799 --> 01:06:36,717
You can go to the play,
then get on the plane.

723
01:06:42,223 --> 01:06:45,893
Have you seen my compact?
You know, the silver one.

724
01:06:46,436 --> 01:06:48,771
No, I haven't.

725
01:06:51,607 --> 01:06:53,776
I hope I didn't leave it
at the hotel.

726
01:06:55,153 --> 01:06:57,155
It was a gift from my grandmother.

727
01:07:04,078 --> 01:07:05,913
Where did you get this?

728
01:07:07,749 --> 01:07:11,002
Um... it's surgeon number two's.

729
01:07:11,085 --> 01:07:12,920
He left it here last week.

730
01:07:14,881 --> 01:07:16,549
Oh, my God.
It's so much like...

731
01:07:17,967 --> 01:07:19,218
What?

732
01:07:22,305 --> 01:07:23,639
Matthew.

733
01:07:36,235 --> 01:07:38,446
So you're not getting
into too much trouble?

734
01:07:39,864 --> 01:07:40,907
Thanks.

735
01:07:40,990 --> 01:07:42,533
Take care of yourself, okay?

736
01:08:31,541 --> 01:08:34,043
- Come on, let me film you.
- No. You first.

737
01:08:34,127 --> 01:08:38,339
Come on, Alex. Are you shy? You can't
be shy if you wanna be an actress.

738
01:08:38,423 --> 01:08:39,465
Here.

739
01:08:39,549 --> 01:08:42,260
- Shakespeare?
- This is your big break.

740
01:08:42,343 --> 01:08:44,846
That's Shakespeare.
I can't do that. That's too hard.

741
01:08:44,929 --> 01:08:47,432
Haply, when I shall wed.

742
01:08:47,473 --> 01:08:49,976
That lord whose hand
must take my plight

743
01:08:50,059 --> 01:08:54,397
shall carry half my love with him,
half my care and duty.

744
01:08:54,480 --> 01:08:59,110
Surely I shall never marry
like my sisters to love my father all.

745
01:09:00,027 --> 01:09:04,615
So true, my lord.
In life... oh! I blew it.

746
01:09:04,657 --> 01:09:06,325
I'm sorry. That was bad.

747
01:09:07,660 --> 01:09:09,829
No, that was amazing.

748
01:09:09,912 --> 01:09:12,957
You know, the thing with acting, Alex,
is you just have to commit.

749
01:09:13,040 --> 01:09:14,792
Otherwise, you're just a phony.

750
01:09:19,547 --> 01:09:20,798
I can't hear anything.

751
01:09:20,882 --> 01:09:22,049
I know.

752
01:09:23,509 --> 01:09:24,659
That's weird.

753
01:09:29,098 --> 01:09:31,309
- Is it hooked up right?
- Yeah.

754
01:09:31,392 --> 01:09:33,144
Can you take it back?

755
01:09:34,353 --> 01:09:36,731
I know a place
I can get it fixed, actually.

756
01:09:40,443 --> 01:09:42,987
Do you believe
in love at first sight?

757
01:09:43,029 --> 01:09:44,322
Well, who is he?

758
01:09:46,449 --> 01:09:48,242
Don't even try to lie about it.

759
01:09:48,868 --> 01:09:51,996
I haven't met him yet.
I've just seen him.

760
01:09:52,080 --> 01:09:54,749
I don't think he's got a girlfriend.
I can tell.

761
01:09:54,832 --> 01:09:56,918
Don't wait.
The good ones go fast.

762
01:09:57,668 --> 01:10:01,005
Well, I gotta go get the video camera,
so I'll talk to you later.

763
01:10:01,047 --> 01:10:02,197
All right.

764
01:10:02,256 --> 01:10:05,218
Hey... promise you'll talk to him?

765
01:10:06,385 --> 01:10:08,513
Yeah... I'll think about it.

766
01:10:08,596 --> 01:10:10,139
Okay. Bye.

767
01:10:51,889 --> 01:10:52,932
I'll be right back.

768
01:10:53,015 --> 01:10:54,934
- Sorry.
- Matthew, where are you going?

769
01:10:55,017 --> 01:10:56,352
Sorry.

770
01:11:24,797 --> 01:11:27,508
My God.
It's so much like... Matthew.

771
01:11:29,135 --> 01:11:30,285
Don't be silly.

772
01:11:30,344 --> 01:11:32,805
It belongs to one of the doctors
at the hospital.

773
01:11:34,766 --> 01:11:36,934
Why would you think of Matthew?

774
01:11:43,316 --> 01:11:46,110
Could I borrow
your car again tonight?

775
01:11:46,194 --> 01:11:47,344
Oh, sure.

776
01:11:48,988 --> 01:11:50,198
Thanks, Lisa.

777
01:11:51,157 --> 01:11:54,285
Well, I better go.
I'll see you later.

778
01:11:54,368 --> 01:11:55,536
Okay.

779
01:12:00,333 --> 01:12:02,293
Hi, excuse me?

780
01:12:02,376 --> 01:12:05,963
I think I might have left a compact.
It's silver, engraved.

781
01:12:06,005 --> 01:12:07,507
Um, let me ask.

782
01:12:07,590 --> 01:12:10,843
Tony, did anyone turn in
a silver compact?

783
01:12:10,927 --> 01:12:12,345
No. Sorry.

784
01:12:12,386 --> 01:12:14,138
Okay. Thank you.

785
01:12:14,180 --> 01:12:15,330
Lisa?

786
01:12:16,849 --> 01:12:18,184
Yeah?

787
01:12:18,267 --> 01:12:21,979
A guy did come in here looking for you.
Said he found your keys. Oh! And...

788
01:12:25,149 --> 01:12:26,317
He left you this.

789
01:12:26,359 --> 01:12:27,652
- Thank you.
- Sure.

790
01:12:31,656 --> 01:12:34,325
"Lisa. I've been trying to find you.

791
01:12:34,367 --> 01:12:36,160
"I have your powder case.

792
01:12:36,244 --> 01:12:37,745
"Call me.

793
01:12:37,829 --> 01:12:38,996
Matthew."

794
01:13:29,380 --> 01:13:31,716
Hey, Luke, can I talk to you
for a second?

795
01:13:32,675 --> 01:13:35,011
Hey, Ellie, do me a favor.
Will you help her out?

796
01:13:35,094 --> 01:13:36,244
Yeah, sure.

797
01:13:36,304 --> 01:13:37,472
How's it goin'?

798
01:13:37,555 --> 01:13:39,932
Hey. I just wanna say thanks
for everything

799
01:13:40,016 --> 01:13:42,226
and, you know,
you've been great.

800
01:13:42,268 --> 01:13:44,604
What about the play?
I thought you were comin' to the play.

801
01:13:45,897 --> 01:13:48,566
I don't wanna miss
another flight, you know.

802
01:13:48,608 --> 01:13:51,360
Listen, I'll make it up to you
when I get back. I promise.

803
01:13:52,653 --> 01:13:53,863
Hey, taxi!

804
01:13:54,614 --> 01:13:57,909
You have fun tonight, though, all right?
Say hi to Alex for me, and, you know.

805
01:13:57,992 --> 01:13:59,952
- You're a lucky guy.
- You got plenty of time.

806
01:13:59,994 --> 01:14:03,331
It's the late flight. I really want you
to come to the play. Please?

807
01:14:03,414 --> 01:14:06,459
See, things, um... it's just not going
that well with Alex.

808
01:14:06,542 --> 01:14:08,795
I've been kind of
exaggerating a little.

809
01:14:09,337 --> 01:14:10,797
What do you mean?

810
01:14:10,838 --> 01:14:12,006
Well...

811
01:14:12,090 --> 01:14:14,425
Lying.
Uh! I've been lying!

812
01:14:14,467 --> 01:14:16,094
It's 'cause my life's so pathetic.

813
01:14:16,135 --> 01:14:17,470
No all-night marathon?

814
01:14:17,553 --> 01:14:19,972
God, I'm lucky if I get a kiss
at the end of the night.

815
01:14:20,014 --> 01:14:23,643
So I was thinking that if you came
to the play, I think that would really help.

816
01:14:23,726 --> 01:14:26,437
I mean, I'd be so much more
confident with you there.

817
01:14:26,521 --> 01:14:29,482
And then I can go to the bathroom
and you can tell her,

818
01:14:29,524 --> 01:14:31,192
you know, what a great guy I am

819
01:14:31,275 --> 01:14:34,195
and rumor has it I'm really good
in the sack, and that, um...

820
01:14:34,278 --> 01:14:36,656
I'm hung like a camel...
I don't know.

821
01:14:38,408 --> 01:14:40,993
Please? I wouldn't ask
if it didn't mean a lot to me.

822
01:14:41,077 --> 01:14:44,038
- I'll be there.
- Oh, you're the best. Thanks, buddy.

823
01:14:44,747 --> 01:14:45,915
7:30, all right?

824
01:14:45,998 --> 01:14:48,126
- I got it.
- Good. There you go.

825
01:14:48,209 --> 01:14:49,877
- See you, brother.
- Yeah.

826
01:14:51,671 --> 01:14:53,005
You the man. Thanks, man.

827
01:14:53,089 --> 01:14:57,009
Well, you're all set.
You're on flight 1559. First class.

828
01:14:57,927 --> 01:14:59,077
Have a good trip.

829
01:15:00,054 --> 01:15:01,389
I will. Thanks a lot.

830
01:15:22,410 --> 01:15:24,579
Um, I'm booked in a flight
to London today.

831
01:15:24,662 --> 01:15:27,165
I'd like to postpone it
until tomorrow, please.

832
01:15:30,918 --> 01:15:33,755
Those shoes.
The black ones with the red sole.

833
01:15:33,838 --> 01:15:35,715
I'd like to try them on. Please.

834
01:16:00,865 --> 01:16:05,369
Oh, excuse me, dear. Could you tell me
how to get to this museum from here?

835
01:16:07,080 --> 01:16:09,582
I think it's...

836
01:16:11,417 --> 01:16:12,919
I think it's back here.

837
01:16:15,630 --> 01:16:18,007
- Let me show you. I'll walk you.
- Oh, thank you.

838
01:16:47,453 --> 01:16:49,038
Alex, ten minutes!

839
01:16:49,789 --> 01:16:51,624
This is it right up here.

840
01:16:53,960 --> 01:16:55,962
- Here. Keep the change.
- Thanks.

841
01:16:56,963 --> 01:16:58,113
Thanks.

842
01:17:05,096 --> 01:17:08,808
How much better that man should fall
before the lion than the wolf.

843
01:17:09,684 --> 01:17:12,520
The clock upbraids me
with the waste of time.

844
01:17:14,147 --> 01:17:17,316
Be not afraid, good youth.
I will not have you.

845
01:17:17,400 --> 01:17:19,402
And yet when wit and youth
is come to harvest,

846
01:17:19,485 --> 01:17:21,946
your wife is like
to reap a proper man.

847
01:17:22,029 --> 01:17:23,197
I'm right here. Sorry.

848
01:17:23,281 --> 01:17:24,782
There lies your way.
Due west.

849
01:17:24,866 --> 01:17:25,950
Excuse me.

850
01:17:25,992 --> 01:17:30,621
Then westward ho. Grace and
good disposition attend your ladyship.

851
01:17:30,663 --> 01:17:33,750
You'll nothing, madam,
to my lord by me?

852
01:17:36,335 --> 01:17:37,503
Stay!

853
01:17:38,254 --> 01:17:40,840
I prithee, tell me
what thou thinkst of me.

854
01:17:40,923 --> 01:17:43,426
That you do... think...

855
01:17:49,891 --> 01:17:52,060
Sit down.

856
01:17:52,143 --> 01:17:53,478
- You are...
- Sorry.

857
01:17:54,854 --> 01:17:56,481
Not what you are.

858
01:17:57,648 --> 01:17:59,108
Is that her?

859
01:17:59,192 --> 01:18:00,693
Yeah, that's my girl.

860
01:18:03,237 --> 01:18:04,822
Then think you right.

861
01:18:05,698 --> 01:18:07,200
I am not what I am.

862
01:18:07,283 --> 01:18:09,619
I would you were
as I would have you be.

863
01:18:10,703 --> 01:18:13,498
Would it be better,

864
01:18:14,248 --> 01:18:16,751
I wish it might,
for now I am your fool.

865
01:18:23,591 --> 01:18:24,926
You're in love with this guy.

866
01:18:25,009 --> 01:18:27,512
And he is asking you
to help him get another woman!

867
01:18:27,553 --> 01:18:30,932
You're upset. You're confused.
It's tearing you up inside!

868
01:18:31,891 --> 01:18:34,185
You have been in love before.
Haven't you?

869
01:18:43,194 --> 01:18:46,072
By my innocence, I swear,
and by my youth,

870
01:18:46,114 --> 01:18:49,617
I have one heart,

871
01:18:49,700 --> 01:18:52,703
And no woman has,

872
01:18:52,745 --> 01:18:55,373
mistress be of it
to save I alone.

873
01:18:56,124 --> 01:18:58,793
And so adieu, good madam.

874
01:18:58,876 --> 01:19:01,796
Nevermore will I my master's tears
to you deplore.

875
01:19:05,633 --> 01:19:06,843
She's good.

876
01:19:19,439 --> 01:19:21,566
Look, I should really get
to the airport.

877
01:19:21,649 --> 01:19:23,818
Yeah. Yeah.
If you have to go, go.

878
01:19:23,901 --> 01:19:27,780
I'm sure Alex is gonna be disappointed
she didn't get a chance to meet you.

879
01:19:27,864 --> 01:19:30,116
Tell her she did a great job.
And I'll see you on Monday.

880
01:19:30,199 --> 01:19:33,119
I will. Hey, Matt, thanks for everything.
It means a lot to me.

881
01:19:33,911 --> 01:19:35,580
I'm sorry you didn't find Lisa.

882
01:19:36,289 --> 01:19:37,582
Yeah, me, too.

883
01:19:39,542 --> 01:19:41,836
- I'll see you around, huh?
- All right, man.

884
01:20:07,904 --> 01:20:09,322
Hey, Alex.

885
01:20:09,363 --> 01:20:10,865
Alex, it's me.

886
01:20:11,824 --> 01:20:13,326
Please go away.

887
01:20:14,285 --> 01:20:15,787
C'mon, baby. Open the door.

888
01:20:15,870 --> 01:20:18,706
I don't want your friend
to see me like this.

889
01:20:18,790 --> 01:20:21,042
He won't. He left.

890
01:20:22,502 --> 01:20:26,798
What? He left?
Did I scare him away?

891
01:20:26,839 --> 01:20:28,591
Scare him away?
You blew him away.

892
01:20:28,674 --> 01:20:32,303
You blew everyone away.
You were unbelievable.

893
01:20:32,386 --> 01:20:33,805
He just had a plane to catch.

894
01:20:33,846 --> 01:20:36,849
A slow one to China.
Open the door.

895
01:20:37,683 --> 01:20:39,060
Did he find her?

896
01:20:40,019 --> 01:20:41,169
What?

897
01:20:42,563 --> 01:20:43,981
Your friend... did...

898
01:20:45,900 --> 01:20:47,402
Did he find Lisa?

899
01:20:49,654 --> 01:20:54,659
No, it just turned out to be some... psycho
with the same name, same everything.

900
01:20:54,700 --> 01:20:57,703
He slept on her couch and ran away
as fast as he could.

901
01:20:59,205 --> 01:21:00,355
Are you okay?

902
01:21:03,543 --> 01:21:05,336
Alex. You've gotta help me.

903
01:21:07,004 --> 01:21:08,214
What's wrong?

904
01:21:08,297 --> 01:21:11,342
Well, I booked this job...
A European tour of Cabaret.

905
01:21:11,426 --> 01:21:12,927
Oh, wow! That's fantastic!

906
01:21:13,010 --> 01:21:15,680
I know. Some girl broke her ankle,
I'm taking over.

907
01:21:15,722 --> 01:21:17,515
But listen, I can't find Matthew.

908
01:21:17,557 --> 01:21:21,728
I've been looking all over for him,
and my plane's leaving in two hours.

909
01:21:21,811 --> 01:21:23,813
Did you leave him a message?

910
01:21:23,896 --> 01:21:26,357
I can't really leave this
on his machine, you know.

911
01:21:26,441 --> 01:21:28,192
It's too complicated.

912
01:21:28,276 --> 01:21:31,028
I wrote him a letter.
Do you mind giving it to him?

913
01:21:32,864 --> 01:21:35,700
I've never even met him.
He doesn't know who I am.

914
01:21:35,742 --> 01:21:39,078
It doesn't matter... just tell him
you're my friend. It'll be fine.

915
01:21:39,162 --> 01:21:41,581
You know what,

916
01:21:41,622 --> 01:21:44,792
just let yourself in
and leave it on his bed.

917
01:21:46,753 --> 01:21:49,589
I really appreciate this.
Thank you so much.

918
01:21:49,672 --> 01:21:51,591
Sure. Okay.

919
01:21:51,674 --> 01:21:52,824
All right.

920
01:21:56,846 --> 01:21:58,556
He asked me to move in with him.

921
01:22:00,558 --> 01:22:02,935
Oh. What did you say?

922
01:22:03,019 --> 01:22:04,562
I didn't really say anything.

923
01:22:04,645 --> 01:22:07,815
I was late for a class,

924
01:22:08,649 --> 01:22:12,111
I said I'd meet him tomorrow.
If I don't show up, you know, he'll go nuts.

925
01:22:12,153 --> 01:22:13,738
Anyway, I have to go.

926
01:22:13,780 --> 01:22:16,616
Thanks again, and I'll call you
when I get there, okay?

927
01:22:16,699 --> 01:22:18,826
Are you gonna do it?

928
01:22:19,869 --> 01:22:22,121
Of course.
I love him.

929
01:22:24,165 --> 01:22:25,315
Bye.

930
01:22:25,416 --> 01:22:26,566
Bye.

931
01:22:59,534 --> 01:23:02,703
Hey. This is Matthew.
Please leave a message.

932
01:23:03,830 --> 01:23:06,582
Hey. It's me again.

933
01:23:07,458 --> 01:23:08,918
Where are you?

934
01:23:09,001 --> 01:23:11,003
Did you get my letter?

935
01:23:11,087 --> 01:23:12,755
Anyway. I'm in Paris.

936
01:23:12,839 --> 01:23:15,925
I'm at the hotel. You got
the number in my last message.

937
01:23:16,008 --> 01:23:18,302
Matt. Please call me.

938
01:23:18,386 --> 01:23:21,180
This is driving me crazy.
I need to speak to you.

939
01:23:22,348 --> 01:23:25,393
Look. If you're angry at me.
Then don't be.

940
01:23:26,144 --> 01:23:29,021
Just call... please.
Bye.

941
01:24:09,896 --> 01:24:11,856
I don't know
if I can stay with the show.

942
01:24:11,939 --> 01:24:14,025
I feel like I have to come home
and look for him.

943
01:24:15,151 --> 01:24:16,486
No, I...

944
01:24:18,571 --> 01:24:20,865
I wasn't gonna say
anything before, but...

945
01:24:22,283 --> 01:24:24,494
when I brought him the letter...

946
01:24:25,661 --> 01:24:27,663
he wasn't expecting me, and...

947
01:24:30,333 --> 01:24:33,336
I found him in bed
with another woman, Lisa.

948
01:24:37,632 --> 01:24:39,217
I... I can't believe it.

949
01:24:40,760 --> 01:24:43,137
Just... forget about him.

950
01:24:43,221 --> 01:24:46,349
The best thing for you to do
is stay with the show and...

951
01:24:46,432 --> 01:24:47,725
just forget him.

952
01:24:52,230 --> 01:24:54,565
I really thought I knew him.

953
01:24:54,607 --> 01:24:57,110
Just forget him.
He's not even worth it.

954
01:25:11,290 --> 01:25:13,459
Luke, I'm so sorry.

955
01:25:13,543 --> 01:25:16,337
No. Shh... it's okay.

956
01:25:16,421 --> 01:25:18,089
I'm so sorry.

957
01:25:18,131 --> 01:25:21,092
No. Please, don't apologize.
Please. God.

958
01:25:23,970 --> 01:25:25,763
I know you're doing the best you can.

959
01:25:26,806 --> 01:25:27,956
I just...

960
01:25:32,395 --> 01:25:35,565
I just want you to know that I...
that I love you.

961
01:25:38,860 --> 01:25:41,279
All right? And I don't
wanna play games anymore.

962
01:25:41,320 --> 01:25:43,948
What's the point?
I'm just terrible at them anyway.

963
01:26:40,213 --> 01:26:42,215
Do me a favor.
Grab that, would you?

964
01:26:45,635 --> 01:26:46,844
Hello?

965
01:26:48,054 --> 01:26:49,204
Hello?

966
01:26:49,263 --> 01:26:51,682
- Who's this?
- Who's this?

967
01:26:51,724 --> 01:26:53,726
This is Matthew.
Who is this?

968
01:26:55,561 --> 01:26:56,938
Hello?

969
01:26:57,605 --> 01:26:58,689
Hello?

970
01:26:58,731 --> 01:27:01,818
Hey, what's up, kid?
I thought you left.

971
01:27:02,610 --> 01:27:04,070
No, uh...

972
01:27:05,446 --> 01:27:06,948
What are you still doing here?

973
01:27:07,031 --> 01:27:09,033
I'm over at the...

974
01:27:09,117 --> 01:27:10,451
girl's apartment.

975
01:27:11,285 --> 01:27:13,788
You went back
to the crazy girl's house?

976
01:27:14,747 --> 01:27:16,374
What the hell are you doing there?

977
01:27:19,377 --> 01:27:21,712
I'm really starting
to worry about you, man.

978
01:27:23,047 --> 01:27:24,882
I'm starting to worry myself.

979
01:27:26,592 --> 01:27:28,094
It's not just that.

980
01:27:28,678 --> 01:27:30,763
I couldn't even
get on the airplane.

981
01:27:33,975 --> 01:27:35,143
The thing is...

982
01:27:36,853 --> 01:27:38,563
there's something
about this apartment.

983
01:27:44,444 --> 01:27:46,279
It's like Lisa's been here.

984
01:27:47,488 --> 01:27:50,825
I know this sounds insane. But...

985
01:27:50,908 --> 01:27:53,077
I think this is her place. Man.

986
01:27:56,122 --> 01:27:58,791
Well. Maybe you're
just hot for this crazy girl.

987
01:27:58,875 --> 01:28:02,211
First thing you gotta do is get out
of her apartment and get over here.

988
01:28:02,295 --> 01:28:04,088
I'll tell you about some stuff. Too.

989
01:28:04,130 --> 01:28:08,259
I've had the most amazing night
of my entire life last night.

990
01:28:08,301 --> 01:28:11,471
Okay. I'll be over. Just give me
a couple of minutes. Okay?

991
01:28:11,554 --> 01:28:13,890
All right. I'll wait.
Later.

992
01:28:20,855 --> 01:28:22,857
- Hello?
- Hi. um...

993
01:28:22,940 --> 01:28:25,359
May I speak to Matthew, please?

994
01:28:27,528 --> 01:28:28,821
Who is this?

995
01:28:28,905 --> 01:28:31,324
Um... this is Lisa.

996
01:28:31,365 --> 01:28:34,660
I'm a friend of his.
I'm calling about my compact.

997
01:28:34,744 --> 01:28:36,412
I think he might have found it.

998
01:28:36,496 --> 01:28:38,414
Uh... which Lisa is this?

999
01:28:38,498 --> 01:28:39,791
Pardon me?

1000
01:28:41,667 --> 01:28:43,628
Uh... I'll tell you what...

1001
01:28:43,669 --> 01:28:48,007
He's actually supposed to be here
in a couple of minutes.

1002
01:28:55,848 --> 01:28:56,998
Hello?

1003
01:28:57,058 --> 01:28:58,208
Hello!

1004
01:28:59,143 --> 01:29:00,293
Hi.

1005
01:29:00,353 --> 01:29:01,503
Hi.

1006
01:29:02,647 --> 01:29:04,816
I'm sorry I didn't come back.
My, um...

1007
01:29:05,983 --> 01:29:09,904
double shift turned into a triple,
and I just couldn't get away.

1008
01:29:09,987 --> 01:29:11,823
That's okay.
Don't worry about it.

1009
01:29:12,740 --> 01:29:13,908
Are you mad?

1010
01:29:15,034 --> 01:29:17,286
No. Not at all.
I had a great time.

1011
01:29:18,079 --> 01:29:19,330
Where are you?

1012
01:29:19,414 --> 01:29:22,750
Well, I'm still at work but, um,

1013
01:29:22,834 --> 01:29:24,168
so why don't you wait?

1014
01:29:25,503 --> 01:29:26,712
Yeah, I'll wait.

1015
01:29:26,796 --> 01:29:29,132
Okay. Great.
I'll see you soon.

1016
01:29:31,342 --> 01:29:36,389
Let me. Uh...
let me grab your phone number

1017
01:29:36,472 --> 01:29:39,851
and I will have him call you
when he gets in.

1018
01:29:39,934 --> 01:29:45,606
Um, you know... actually, could you
just tell him to meet me at 3:00?

1019
01:29:45,690 --> 01:29:48,526
He'd know where.
Um, I'll be waiting for him.

1020
01:29:48,568 --> 01:29:50,862
3:00. Okay.

1021
01:29:50,945 --> 01:29:54,198
I... you know what,
it can't be him already,

1022
01:29:54,240 --> 01:29:55,742
but I'm expecting him.

1023
01:29:55,825 --> 01:29:58,411
Someone's at my front door.
So maybe it is him.

1024
01:29:58,494 --> 01:29:59,829
So hold on a second.

1025
01:30:07,086 --> 01:30:08,921
Matthew, trust me, okay?

1026
01:30:10,381 --> 01:30:12,425
Meet me tomorrow in the park.
Same time.

1027
01:30:15,595 --> 01:30:16,745
Bye.

1028
01:30:25,438 --> 01:30:27,690
Yeah. I'm sorry.
It wasn't him. It was someone else.

1029
01:30:27,774 --> 01:30:32,028
But I promise you
I will give him your message. Okay?

1030
01:30:32,111 --> 01:30:33,821
Oh. Okay. Thank you.

1031
01:30:39,786 --> 01:30:41,913
I went to get cigarettes.
What's going on?

1032
01:30:43,289 --> 01:30:45,750
Matthew. He didn't leave.

1033
01:30:45,833 --> 01:30:48,669
He went back to that girl's house.
The crazy one.

1034
01:30:48,753 --> 01:30:50,713
Oh, the plot thickens.

1035
01:30:50,797 --> 01:30:52,882
Oh, yeah. It gets even better.
Listen to this.

1036
01:30:52,965 --> 01:30:56,761
So I hang up the phone,
and five seconds later, Lisa called.

1037
01:30:58,179 --> 01:31:01,516
The real Lisa.
The one from two years ago.

1038
01:31:01,599 --> 01:31:02,934
She wants to see him.

1039
01:31:05,478 --> 01:31:06,729
You tell him?

1040
01:31:06,813 --> 01:31:09,732
No, not yet.
I'll wait till he gets here.

1041
01:31:09,816 --> 01:31:12,777
He's gonna be so happy,
he's gonna hit the moon again.

1042
01:31:12,860 --> 01:31:14,028
I have to go!

1043
01:31:14,695 --> 01:31:16,864
- What do you mean?
- I'll call you later. I promise.

1044
01:31:16,948 --> 01:31:19,283
But I made breakfast.
My dad's famous potatoes.

1045
01:31:26,666 --> 01:31:29,043
Lisa called.
She wants to see him.

1046
01:31:31,421 --> 01:31:33,548
So, will you let me
meet your friends?

1047
01:31:33,631 --> 01:31:35,299
Don't you have a store to run?

1048
01:31:35,341 --> 01:31:36,968
Oh, okay.
I can take a hint.

1049
01:31:37,009 --> 01:31:38,636
So we're going out tomorrow, right?

1050
01:31:38,719 --> 01:31:40,722
- 7:00?
- Sure.

1051
01:31:40,805 --> 01:31:41,848
Okay.

1052
01:31:41,931 --> 01:31:44,016
Bye, and thanks for the lift.

1053
01:31:44,100 --> 01:31:45,250
Bye.

1054
01:31:47,854 --> 01:31:49,522
Matty. Hey.
Matty!

1055
01:31:50,606 --> 01:31:52,984
- Matty!
- Luke! Hey, man!

1056
01:31:53,067 --> 01:31:55,319
- How are you, man?
- I'm good. How are you?

1057
01:31:55,403 --> 01:31:56,571
Really good. Really good.

1058
01:32:03,619 --> 01:32:06,873
Oh, excuse me. Could I order an espresso
while I wait for my friend?

1059
01:32:06,956 --> 01:32:08,106
Absolutely.

1060
01:32:14,756 --> 01:32:17,717
He's very impressed
with what you've done.

1061
01:32:17,759 --> 01:32:21,387
And he assures you that
when you get to China...

1062
01:32:22,388 --> 01:32:24,682
with much enthusiasm
and support.

1063
01:32:25,975 --> 01:32:27,477
I'm sitting over here.

1064
01:32:29,353 --> 01:32:30,503
Excuse me. Champagne.

1065
01:32:38,071 --> 01:32:39,221
Excuse you.

1066
01:32:41,657 --> 01:32:42,807
No.

1067
01:32:44,744 --> 01:32:46,913
Uh, Miss Chin,

1068
01:32:49,874 --> 01:32:51,334
Shit, shit, shit!

1069
01:32:51,417 --> 01:32:53,586
As you can see, uh...

1070
01:32:56,798 --> 01:32:58,132
Here, Sweetie...

1071
01:33:08,434 --> 01:33:10,061
Hello. Bellucci's.
May I help you?

1072
01:33:10,103 --> 01:33:12,188
Hello, may I speak
to my friend Lisa, please?

1073
01:33:12,271 --> 01:33:15,066
She's the blonde.
She's sitting at a table behind the bar.

1074
01:33:16,692 --> 01:33:17,860
Yes. Just a minute. Please.

1075
01:33:17,944 --> 01:33:20,613
Excuse me. Are you Lisa?

1076
01:33:21,447 --> 01:33:22,490
Phone's for you.

1077
01:33:22,573 --> 01:33:25,493
It's a little noisy here. Why don't you
take the house phone around the corner.

1078
01:33:25,576 --> 01:33:26,744
Okay. Thank you.

1079
01:33:26,828 --> 01:33:31,791
To a long and prosperous marriage...
of our two companies.

1080
01:33:32,917 --> 01:33:35,378
Excuse me. I'm gonna go make
a phone call. I'll be right back.

1081
01:33:35,461 --> 01:33:36,611
No.

1082
01:33:38,840 --> 01:33:39,924
No.

1083
01:33:39,966 --> 01:33:42,468
- Hello?
- Hey, Lisa. It's me.

1084
01:33:42,552 --> 01:33:43,886
Hey. What happened to you?

1085
01:33:43,970 --> 01:33:46,097
I know. I'm so sorry.
I got stuck at work.

1086
01:33:46,180 --> 01:33:48,599
Look. Daniel's found me
at the hotel.

1087
01:33:48,683 --> 01:33:50,518
Hang on.
Just a minute!

1088
01:33:52,478 --> 01:33:55,148
Look, could I stay at your place
for a couple of days?

1089
01:33:55,231 --> 01:33:57,066
Yeah, of course. Um...

1090
01:33:57,984 --> 01:34:00,361
Go there right now.
I'll... I'll meet you there.

1091
01:34:18,004 --> 01:34:19,154
Hey.

1092
01:34:19,213 --> 01:34:20,363
Hey.

1093
01:34:23,593 --> 01:34:24,677
How are you, Lisa?

1094
01:34:24,761 --> 01:34:27,346
Good. How are you?

1095
01:34:27,430 --> 01:34:28,580
Good.

1096
01:34:30,349 --> 01:34:31,976
Thought you'd be in China by now.

1097
01:34:32,852 --> 01:34:34,771
That makes two of us.
Sit down.

1098
01:34:38,357 --> 01:34:40,485
- What's that?
- It's a present.

1099
01:34:40,568 --> 01:34:42,153
- For me?
- Yeah.

1100
01:34:44,072 --> 01:34:47,492
I saw that yours were...
Yours were broken, so...

1101
01:34:49,118 --> 01:34:50,411
Uh, wanna try them on?

1102
01:34:53,748 --> 01:34:55,833
That's very sweet.
You didn't have to do that.

1103
01:34:55,875 --> 01:34:57,168
Oh, that's okay.

1104
01:35:05,134 --> 01:35:06,302
They're a little big.

1105
01:35:09,389 --> 01:35:11,432
What size shoe do you wear?

1106
01:35:15,645 --> 01:35:16,795
Seven.

1107
01:35:18,564 --> 01:35:20,191
These are 8 1/2.

1108
01:35:27,949 --> 01:35:32,036
I would've told you what size I was if I
knew you were gonna get me some shoes.

1109
01:35:33,121 --> 01:35:34,872
It's okay.
I could exchange them.

1110
01:35:39,752 --> 01:35:41,295
You don't have to do that. I...

1111
01:35:42,046 --> 01:35:45,299
Anyway, I told a friend of mine I'd
meet him for coffee before I left, so...

1112
01:35:46,759 --> 01:35:48,428
What? You're leaving?

1113
01:35:49,554 --> 01:35:50,722
Yeah.

1114
01:35:52,932 --> 01:35:54,082
Bye.

1115
01:36:12,452 --> 01:36:14,996
Hey, Luke. It's me.
Let's meet.

1116
01:36:44,650 --> 01:36:45,985
Jesus Christ.

1117
01:36:46,069 --> 01:36:48,029
What are you doin'?
I thought you were comin' by.

1118
01:36:48,112 --> 01:36:51,449
I, uh... I was comin' by.
I just lost track of the time.

1119
01:36:51,491 --> 01:36:54,160
I got good news for you.
Let's go have a drink.

1120
01:36:54,243 --> 01:36:56,079
I want you to meet someone.
Come on.

1121
01:36:58,289 --> 01:36:59,439
Come on.

1122
01:37:04,921 --> 01:37:08,424
Hey, babe. I came as soon as you called.
Look who I ran into. It's Matthew.

1123
01:37:08,508 --> 01:37:10,510
Matthew, Alex.

1124
01:37:10,593 --> 01:37:12,595
Finally you two meet.

1125
01:37:21,979 --> 01:37:23,231
Hi.

1126
01:37:24,232 --> 01:37:25,382
Hello.

1127
01:37:26,359 --> 01:37:27,527
Have a seat.

1128
01:37:33,616 --> 01:37:34,784
Hi.

1129
01:37:34,867 --> 01:37:36,285
Hello.

1130
01:37:36,369 --> 01:37:37,519
Want a cocktail?

1131
01:37:38,538 --> 01:37:39,688
Excuse me.

1132
01:37:41,332 --> 01:37:42,583
Hi, how can I help you?

1133
01:37:42,667 --> 01:37:43,835
What do you want?

1134
01:37:43,876 --> 01:37:46,796
A vodka rocks. Double.

1135
01:37:47,463 --> 01:37:48,548
Wow.

1136
01:37:48,631 --> 01:37:49,781
Baby?

1137
01:37:50,883 --> 01:37:53,511
You know what? I'll have, um,

1138
01:37:53,553 --> 01:37:56,431
Put it in a bucket. Not like a double,

1139
01:37:56,514 --> 01:37:58,641
He knows how to do it.
Thanks.

1140
01:37:58,725 --> 01:37:59,767
You got it.

1141
01:37:59,851 --> 01:38:01,561
So what happened
with your psycho?

1142
01:38:04,647 --> 01:38:07,817
You can say it in front of Alex.
She knows the whole story anyway.

1143
01:38:12,071 --> 01:38:14,449
Sometimes when you see
someone from afar...

1144
01:38:16,075 --> 01:38:17,744
you develop a fantasy.

1145
01:38:20,913 --> 01:38:22,331
Then when you see them up close,

1146
01:38:22,415 --> 01:38:24,709
nine times out of ten,

1147
01:38:28,921 --> 01:38:32,467
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

1148
01:38:35,762 --> 01:38:39,182
I was confused,

1149
01:38:40,141 --> 01:38:46,314
thought I'd find what I was looking for,
but I found something else.

1150
01:38:48,107 --> 01:38:49,275
Did you talk to her?

1151
01:38:50,359 --> 01:38:53,279
Just long enough for her
to convince me that she's a liar.

1152
01:38:54,614 --> 01:38:56,199
No harm, no foul, though, right?

1153
01:38:58,534 --> 01:39:01,537
What do you think, Alex?
I mean, you know the whole story.

1154
01:39:04,123 --> 01:39:06,209
It's easy to stand back and judge.

1155
01:39:06,292 --> 01:39:09,003
You don't know anything
about this woman.

1156
01:39:09,754 --> 01:39:13,674
I know that she has no conscience
and no regard for anyone but herself.

1157
01:39:13,758 --> 01:39:15,343
I mean, what else do I need to know?

1158
01:39:15,426 --> 01:39:17,845
You make yourself
into such a victim.

1159
01:39:17,929 --> 01:39:21,015
Nobody made you be with her. You can't
even see what a hypocrite you're being.

1160
01:39:21,099 --> 01:39:22,767
I'm being a hypocrite?
How am I being a hypocrite?

1161
01:39:22,809 --> 01:39:24,685
- Yes, you are!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1162
01:39:24,769 --> 01:39:26,104
You guys. Hey, relax.

1163
01:39:26,187 --> 01:39:27,522
No, Luke. Hey, hold on.

1164
01:39:27,605 --> 01:39:30,483
Alex, I'd like you to explain to me
how I'm being a hypocrite.

1165
01:39:34,278 --> 01:39:39,617
Who's to say this woman hasn't been
in love with you for a really long time?

1166
01:39:39,659 --> 01:39:44,247
And now that she found you again,
she wasn't about to let you go twice.

1167
01:39:47,041 --> 01:39:48,126
What?

1168
01:39:48,167 --> 01:39:49,317
Maybe...

1169
01:39:49,377 --> 01:39:51,212
the first time she saw you,

1170
01:39:51,295 --> 01:39:54,465
maybe she felt the way you did
the first time you saw Lisa.

1171
01:39:55,883 --> 01:39:57,135
You remember that.

1172
01:39:58,761 --> 01:40:01,222
Love makes you do crazy things.

1173
01:40:02,056 --> 01:40:03,516
Insane things.

1174
01:40:04,684 --> 01:40:07,687
Things in a million years
you never thought you'd see yourself do.

1175
01:40:10,064 --> 01:40:12,650
There you are doin' it.
Can't help it.

1176
01:40:13,693 --> 01:40:16,821
Jesus Christ.
Lighten up, you guys.

1177
01:40:16,904 --> 01:40:20,074
This woman... she's a nut.
She's psycho.

1178
01:40:20,158 --> 01:40:23,119
She's cuckoo-bananas, all right?
End of story.

1179
01:40:23,202 --> 01:40:25,329
Can we change the subject?

1180
01:40:25,371 --> 01:40:27,457
I actually have something
to cheer you up.

1181
01:40:27,540 --> 01:40:31,461
Did you, uh, leave a note
with the bartender here a few days ago?

1182
01:40:32,420 --> 01:40:34,172
Yeah, I did.

1183
01:40:34,213 --> 01:40:35,548
'Cause Lisa called.

1184
01:40:36,215 --> 01:40:37,383
What?

1185
01:40:37,467 --> 01:40:42,346
Yeah! After you got off the phone.
She said to meet her at 3:00.

1186
01:40:42,388 --> 01:40:46,017
She couldn't wait long, 'cause she had
to get on a plane to London.

1187
01:40:47,435 --> 01:40:49,562
W-where am I
supposed to meet her?

1188
01:40:49,645 --> 01:40:51,689
She didn't say.
She said you'd know.

1189
01:40:52,523 --> 01:40:53,983
You don't know?

1190
01:40:55,318 --> 01:40:57,195
I think you know where.

1191
01:40:57,236 --> 01:40:58,946
It hasn't been that long, has it?

1192
01:40:59,030 --> 01:41:00,198
What?

1193
01:41:01,199 --> 01:41:03,659
You know, uh...

1194
01:41:04,494 --> 01:41:06,204
Maybe he'll know something.

1195
01:41:08,915 --> 01:41:10,750
You knew she was here
the whole time?

1196
01:41:21,094 --> 01:41:23,054
This belongs to you.

1197
01:41:23,096 --> 01:41:24,722
It's from her.

1198
01:41:38,277 --> 01:41:42,865
"Matt. Please don't think
that I'm running away from you.

1199
01:41:42,949 --> 01:41:46,160
"I was so overwhelmed
when you asked me to move in.

1200
01:41:46,244 --> 01:41:48,413
"I couldn't speak.

1201
01:41:48,454 --> 01:41:51,290
"My answer. Of course. Is yes.

1202
01:41:51,374 --> 01:41:54,419
I love you.
And can't wait to come home."

1203
01:41:57,922 --> 01:42:00,258
I'm not going to apologize
for what I've done.

1204
01:42:03,761 --> 01:42:05,722
This is for me to live with now.

1205
01:42:10,727 --> 01:42:12,729
Now you see me for who I am.

1206
01:42:20,903 --> 01:42:22,613
Yes, I do.

1207
01:42:33,833 --> 01:42:35,001
Hey. Where you goin'?

1208
01:42:35,084 --> 01:42:36,252
Hey.

1209
01:42:36,335 --> 01:42:37,795
Where you goin'?

1210
01:42:37,879 --> 01:42:39,380
I know where she is.

1211
01:42:40,214 --> 01:42:41,883
All right.
Tell me what happens.

1212
01:42:43,676 --> 01:42:46,804
That guy. He's um...

1213
01:42:46,888 --> 01:42:49,140
more drama
than a Mexican soap opera.

1214
01:42:49,182 --> 01:42:51,976
Luke! This...

1215
01:42:52,060 --> 01:42:53,227
This is over.

1216
01:42:53,311 --> 01:42:54,771
- What's over?
- Us.

1217
01:42:56,564 --> 01:42:58,566
How can it be over?
We haven't even started yet.

1218
01:42:58,649 --> 01:43:00,318
I'm not who you think I am.

1219
01:43:01,694 --> 01:43:02,987
I used you.

1220
01:43:18,169 --> 01:43:19,319
Taxi!

1221
01:43:20,671 --> 01:43:21,821
Come on.

1222
01:43:35,937 --> 01:43:37,087
Hey!

1223
01:43:38,064 --> 01:43:39,565
Hey, come on!

1224
01:43:40,274 --> 01:43:42,235
God!

1225
01:43:46,239 --> 01:43:47,389
Hey!

1226
01:43:49,409 --> 01:43:51,160
Hey! Hey!

1227
01:43:55,248 --> 01:43:56,416
Sorry.

1228
01:43:56,499 --> 01:43:57,542
Thanks.

1229
01:43:57,625 --> 01:43:59,794
- Goin' to Wicker Park.
- Yeah, right away.

1230
01:45:01,189 --> 01:45:02,857
Your attention. Please.

1231
01:45:02,940 --> 01:45:06,277
Flight 862 service to London
is now boarding.

1232
01:45:33,179 --> 01:45:34,329
Hi!

1233
01:45:35,598 --> 01:45:37,433
There you are!

1234
01:45:37,517 --> 01:45:40,478
Where've you been?
Your flight got in an hour ago.

1235
01:45:40,561 --> 01:45:42,397
I've been down
to luggage claim and back.

1236
01:45:43,731 --> 01:45:45,233
- Rebecca.
- Hey.

1237
01:45:45,316 --> 01:45:46,526
I, um...

1238
01:45:46,609 --> 01:45:48,236
What's the matter?

1239
01:45:48,319 --> 01:45:49,862
Rough flight home?

1240
01:45:49,946 --> 01:45:52,365
Did you bring me back
that little Chinese dress?

1241
01:45:56,202 --> 01:45:57,995
- Rebecca...
- You okay, Sweetie?

1242
01:45:59,747 --> 01:46:01,207
I didn't go to China.

1243
01:46:03,292 --> 01:46:04,669
What are you talking about?

1244
01:46:04,752 --> 01:46:07,839
Hi, Alex. You're never gonna
believe what happened.

1245
01:46:07,922 --> 01:46:09,674
Matthew's back in town.

1246
01:46:11,217 --> 01:46:12,718
I can't marry you.

1247
01:46:13,678 --> 01:46:15,346
It would be a huge mistake.

1248
01:46:15,388 --> 01:46:18,057
You're gonna have to help me out, baby.
Did I do something wrong?

1249
01:46:18,141 --> 01:46:21,018
No, you didn't...
You didn't do anything wrong.

1250
01:46:21,102 --> 01:46:22,252
Rebecca, I...

1251
01:46:23,479 --> 01:46:26,315
I've been doing something wrong
for the last two years.

1252
01:46:27,150 --> 01:46:29,736
I'm not...
I'm not this person.

1253
01:46:29,819 --> 01:46:32,155
I can't go back with you.
I can't do this.

1254
01:46:32,739 --> 01:46:35,241
I was gonna meet him in the park,
but he didn't show up.

1255
01:46:36,284 --> 01:46:38,578
Yeah... I know.

1256
01:46:38,661 --> 01:46:39,996
What do you mean?

1257
01:46:40,079 --> 01:46:45,376
Lisa. I've been doing some really...
horrible and selfish things.

1258
01:46:45,460 --> 01:46:47,211
What are you talking about?

1259
01:46:47,253 --> 01:46:49,380
I've been keeping you apart.

1260
01:46:49,422 --> 01:46:52,633
When we met two years ago,
I was in love with someone else.

1261
01:46:52,717 --> 01:46:55,720
And she just came back
into my life.

1262
01:46:56,471 --> 01:46:59,057
She broke my heart...
And I'm sorry!

1263
01:46:59,640 --> 01:47:00,975
Oh, my God.

1264
01:47:06,773 --> 01:47:09,650
I... Rebecca, I know...

1265
01:47:09,734 --> 01:47:11,569
I know that I'm still in love with her.

1266
01:47:12,361 --> 01:47:14,363
I just... I needed you to know.

1267
01:47:15,156 --> 01:47:16,491
Know what?

1268
01:47:17,617 --> 01:47:19,619
Know what, Matthew?

1269
01:47:20,912 --> 01:47:22,955
That I'm not the girl
that can break your heart?
