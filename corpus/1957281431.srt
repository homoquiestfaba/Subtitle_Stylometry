00:00:11,826 --> 00:00:16,761
Based on a true story

4
00:00:27,603 --> 00:00:30,539
Stephen, only use
weapons for good.

5
00:00:30,573 --> 00:00:31,838
Okay?

6
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:32,773
Only good.

7
00:00:32,775 --> 00:00:34,777
Now, just as I taught you.

8
00:00:36,845 --> 00:00:38,281
Stand up straight.

9
00:00:39,248 --> 00:00:40,049
And draw.

00:00:41,217 --> 00:00:43,686
[eerie music]

11
00:00:46,922 --> 00:00:48,091
Where are you, guys?

12
00:00:48,124 --> 00:00:49,092
I got you.

[alarm beeping]

16
00:01:00,536 --> 00:01:01,935
[Emily] Stephen, come on.

17
00:01:01,937 --> 00:01:04,607
[alarm beeping]

18
00:01:11,447 --> 00:01:13,547
[Randy] Something smells good.

19
00:01:13,549 --> 00:01:14,381
Good morning.

20
00:01:14,383 --> 00:01:16,650
[Randy] Morning.

21
00:01:16,652 --> 00:01:17,484
How are you?

22
00:01:17,486 --> 00:01:19,322
Mm, much better now.

23
00:01:23,092 --> 00:01:26,994
Alexa, you are not going
to school dressed like that.

24
00:01:26,996 --> 00:01:28,331
- Dad.
- Dad what?

25
00:01:28,397 --> 00:01:29,496
Do what Emily,
what your mom said.

26
00:01:29,498 --> 00:01:30,499
Cover yourself up.

27
00:01:30,566 --> 00:01:31,567
- Thank you.
- Really?

28
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:32,601
You're going there.

29
00:01:32,635 --> 00:01:33,567
I'm the head cheerleader.

30
00:01:33,569 --> 00:01:35,136
I'm supposed to look like this.

31
00:01:35,138 --> 00:01:37,073
[Randy] Cover up.

32
00:01:37,106 --> 00:01:38,439
Not a happy daughter.

33
00:01:38,441 --> 00:01:39,740
[Randy] I know honey, I know.

34
00:01:39,742 --> 00:01:40,576
[Emily] Here's your coffee.

35
00:01:40,609 --> 00:01:41,444
Thank you, baby.

36
00:01:41,477 --> 00:01:42,309
Hi.

37
00:01:42,311 --> 00:01:43,144
[Michelle] Morning.

38
00:01:43,146 --> 00:01:44,645
Morning.

39
00:01:44,647 --> 00:01:48,784
Oh, guessing that outfit won't
make it past the front gate.

40
00:01:48,817 --> 00:01:50,951
Why can't you dress normally?

41
00:01:50,953 --> 00:01:54,688
What's wrong with
the way I'm dressed?

42
00:01:54,690 --> 00:01:56,190
Jesus.

43
00:01:56,192 --> 00:01:58,194
Stephen, please don't take
the Lord's name in vain.

44
00:01:58,261 --> 00:01:59,962
Look, if you come dressed to
football practice like that,

45
00:01:59,995 --> 00:02:01,628
you'll be the laughing stock.

46
00:02:01,630 --> 00:02:04,133
And what's with the
black nail polish?

47
00:02:04,167 --> 00:02:06,300
Who wears that to play football?

48
00:02:06,302 --> 00:02:07,968
He could be an Oakland Raider.

49
00:02:07,970 --> 00:02:10,473
Please don't
encourage him, please.

50
00:02:10,506 --> 00:02:12,173
You know, I don't
even like football.

51
00:02:12,175 --> 00:02:13,942
It's stupid.

52
00:02:13,976 --> 00:02:15,642
Besides I'm tired of having
my ass slapped all day

53
00:02:15,644 --> 00:02:18,645
by a bunch of grunting
jocks in tights.

54
00:02:18,647 --> 00:02:20,214
He does have a
point there, honey.

55
00:02:20,216 --> 00:02:21,450
Yeah.

56
00:02:21,484 --> 00:02:23,184
I just don't wanna see
my son dressed up like...

57
00:02:23,186 --> 00:02:25,020
Like a what?

58
00:02:25,054 --> 00:02:26,520
You know you're not my real dad,

59
00:02:26,522 --> 00:02:28,857
so I don't know why you care
about how I'm dressed or what...

60
00:02:28,891 --> 00:02:32,661
God dammit, I'm trying
to get you to focus.

61
00:02:33,662 --> 00:02:34,497
Nice.

62
00:02:36,699 --> 00:02:37,866
You're gonna be late for work

63
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:39,335
and you two will
be late for school.

64
00:02:39,368 --> 00:02:41,535
So let's all move it out, okay?

65
00:02:41,537 --> 00:02:42,369
That's enough, honey.

66
00:02:42,371 --> 00:02:43,206
Yep.

67
00:02:44,873 --> 00:02:46,573
I will see you at
practice today.

68
00:02:46,575 --> 00:02:48,077
We have a big game on Friday.

00:02:48,144 --> 00:02:50,746
[ominous music]

70
00:02:56,385 --> 00:02:58,719
Alexa, be in the car.

71
00:02:58,721 --> 00:02:59,686
Have a good day.

72
00:02:59,688 --> 00:03:01,155
[Randy] Thank you baby.

73
00:03:01,157 --> 00:03:02,691
Stephen, move it.

74
00:03:05,027 --> 00:03:06,160
Now.

75
00:03:06,162 --> 00:03:08,564
[soft music]

76
00:03:12,735 --> 00:03:14,002
Honestly.

00:03:47,936 --> 00:03:49,270
[Carol] Alexa.

81
00:03:49,272 --> 00:03:50,103
Alexa.

82
00:03:50,105 --> 00:03:51,039
Yes?

83
00:03:51,073 --> 00:03:52,439
Don't forget to tell the girls

84
00:03:52,441 --> 00:03:54,143
that practice is 30 minutes
earlier today, okay?

85
00:03:54,210 --> 00:03:55,542
And don't be late.

86
00:03:55,544 --> 00:03:56,377
All right, I won't.

87
00:03:56,379 --> 00:03:57,211
I'll tell them.

88
00:03:57,213 --> 00:03:58,414
See you.

00:04:04,052 --> 00:04:05,619

92
00:04:11,894 --> 00:04:14,328
Stop it, you idiot.

93
00:04:14,330 --> 00:04:15,296
[Ben] No one here to stop me.

94
00:04:15,298 --> 00:04:16,732
[Alexa] Really?

95
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:18,934
Later.

96
00:04:18,967 --> 00:04:20,068
Hey, don't.

97
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:22,305
Let it go.

98
00:04:23,272 --> 00:04:24,840
Come on, let it go.

[Girl] Did you get the
homework that's due today?

102
00:04:46,795 --> 00:04:48,795
Hey, what are you
wearing to practice today?

103
00:04:48,797 --> 00:04:50,030

Stephen O'Connor.

[ruler whipping]

109
00:05:21,364 --> 00:05:23,399
What in the Lord's name do
you think you're wearing?

110
00:05:23,466 --> 00:05:24,965
How dare you enter
these sacred grounds

111
00:05:24,967 --> 00:05:27,135
wearing such evil clothes?

112
00:05:28,136 --> 00:05:30,005
My last name is Tade.

113
00:05:30,038 --> 00:05:32,373
It is not O'Connor.

114
00:05:32,375 --> 00:05:34,375
He's like the
devil, Sister Clare.

115
00:05:34,377 --> 00:05:36,377
Yeah, gay devil.

116
00:05:36,379 --> 00:05:38,046
Quiet, all of you.

117
00:05:40,549 --> 00:05:44,050
You will go to confession
for the entire second period

118
00:05:44,052 --> 00:05:46,722
and this will not go unpunished.

119
00:06:00,736 --> 00:06:03,169
[eerie music]

120
00:06:03,171 --> 00:06:04,938
[Father DuMal] I'm
sorry I'm late to class.

121
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:05,772
Yes, you are.

122
00:06:05,774 --> 00:06:07,543
Class is almost over.

123
00:06:12,415 --> 00:06:14,683
Let's turn to chapter 12.

124
00:06:17,052 --> 00:06:18,387
And get started.

125
00:06:20,723 --> 00:06:21,888
You're getting
to know the inside

126
00:06:21,890 --> 00:06:24,727
of this office pretty
well, aren't ya?

127
00:06:27,262 --> 00:06:30,631
Your Grandpa Joe, we're going
to honor in a couple of days,

128
00:06:30,633 --> 00:06:33,235
has been an integral
part of this church

129
00:06:33,268 --> 00:06:35,602
for more than 30 years.

130
00:06:35,604 --> 00:06:38,140
You are part of his family now.

131
00:06:39,608 --> 00:06:44,246
He looks on you like one
of his true granddaughters.

132
00:06:45,614 --> 00:06:47,414
How do you think he'd feel
about what just went on outside?

133
00:06:47,416 --> 00:06:50,116
[bright music]

134
00:06:50,118 --> 00:06:53,288
Altering our yes,
not very fashionable

135
00:06:54,757 --> 00:06:59,094
or glamorous school uniform
and sashaying across the grass

136
00:06:59,127 --> 00:07:02,565
for the entertainment
of our male students

137
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:07,603
sets the wrong example.

138
00:07:07,636 --> 00:07:08,902
I know.

139
00:07:08,904 --> 00:07:09,738
I know.

140
00:07:10,973 --> 00:07:13,509
I want ya to have fun, Alexa,

141
00:07:15,110 --> 00:07:17,980
but I need you to
respect yourself.

142
00:07:20,616 --> 00:07:23,116
Otherwise no one's
gonna respect ya.

143
00:07:23,118 --> 00:07:25,085
You want the boys to
treat ya properly,

144
00:07:25,087 --> 00:07:27,956
they're never gonna
treat ya properly

145
00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:30,693
if you draw them
into temptation.

146
00:07:33,195 --> 00:07:36,031
[bright music]

147
00:07:36,098 --> 00:07:38,266
I'm sorry, Monsignor.

148
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:40,601
[bright music]

149
00:07:40,603 --> 00:07:41,437
Okay.

150
00:07:43,171 --> 00:07:45,541
Now go on, get back to class.

151
00:07:48,377 --> 00:07:49,645
[Alexa] Thank you, Monsignor.

152
00:07:49,678 --> 00:07:51,177
You're welcome.

153
00:07:51,179 --> 00:07:56,184
[bright music]
[bell chiming]

154
00:08:01,156 --> 00:08:02,491
Possession is
when Satan enters

155
00:08:02,525 --> 00:08:03,957
and takes over the physical

156
00:08:03,959 --> 00:08:06,128
as well as the mental
capabilities of the person.

157
00:08:06,161 --> 00:08:08,228
However the soul
will remain free.

158
00:08:08,230 --> 00:08:09,064
Satan acts through...

159
00:08:09,131 --> 00:08:10,864
Through the victim.

160
00:08:10,866 --> 00:08:13,669
Without the victim's consent.

161
00:08:13,702 --> 00:08:17,504
Thus the victim is
morally blameless.

162
00:08:17,506 --> 00:08:20,008
[eerie music]

163
00:08:22,645 --> 00:08:27,650
Satan does not act alone when
he possesses an individual.

164
00:08:28,751 --> 00:08:31,153
He works side by side
with many spirits.

165
00:08:32,921 --> 00:08:35,424
[eerie music]

166
00:08:37,726 --> 00:08:42,496
Hey faggot, are you gonna
ask God to forgive you?

167
00:08:42,498 --> 00:08:43,999
Spirits of lust.

168
00:08:46,669 --> 00:08:48,003
Spirits of hate.

169
00:08:49,004 --> 00:08:50,338
Destruction.

170
00:08:50,372 --> 00:08:52,875
[eerie music]

171
00:08:54,176 --> 00:08:55,010
Suicide.

172

Torment.

00:09:07,222 --> 00:09:08,421
Enough you assholes.

00:09:08,423 --> 00:09:09,858
[Father DuMal] Stephen.

176
00:09:09,892 --> 00:09:14,394
Now who can find me an
example of that in the Bible?

177
00:09:14,396 --> 00:09:15,295
Michelle.

178
00:09:15,297 --> 00:09:16,763
There's an example in Luke.

179
00:09:16,765 --> 00:09:17,966
The case of the possessed man

180
00:09:18,033 --> 00:09:19,800
in the territory
of the Gerasenes.

181
00:09:19,802 --> 00:09:22,738
And then Jesus asks,
what is your name?

182
00:09:22,771 --> 00:09:26,940
And he replied Legion because
many demons had entered him.

183
00:09:26,942 --> 00:09:28,208
Come with me.

184
00:09:28,210 --> 00:09:30,877
We will address your troubles.

185
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:32,047
Well, right.

186
00:09:34,049 --> 00:09:35,884
Well it was a good class.

187
00:09:35,918 --> 00:09:37,753
Enjoy your day, girls.

188
00:09:40,956 --> 00:09:41,788
[Michelle] Sister Clare?

189
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:43,592
[Sister Clare] Yes.

190
00:09:43,626 --> 00:09:46,292
What do you think is
wrong with my brother?

191
00:09:46,294 --> 00:09:48,797
I think someone is inside him.

192
00:09:50,165 --> 00:09:51,399
Not like possessed...

193
00:09:51,433 --> 00:09:54,467
No one is troubling
your brother, dear.

194
00:09:54,469 --> 00:09:56,438
But something is.

195
00:09:56,471 --> 00:09:58,505
And Sister, sometimes
I feel it, too.

196
00:09:58,507 --> 00:10:00,140
Like a dream you can't remember

197
00:10:00,142 --> 00:10:01,844
and you know it's really
important, but it's...

198
00:10:01,910 --> 00:10:04,580
Twins often transfer thoughts.

199
00:10:07,349 --> 00:10:09,516
You know I am aware
of the troubles

200
00:10:09,518 --> 00:10:13,486
that your brother has had
since your father left

201
00:10:13,488 --> 00:10:14,757
and your mother remarried.

202
00:10:14,790 --> 00:10:16,322
Stephen doesn't
believe he left us.

203
00:10:16,324 --> 00:10:19,695
You have to be strong
for him, Michelle.

204
00:10:19,762 --> 00:10:23,766
Nothing happens without
divine intervention.

205
00:10:23,799 --> 00:10:27,803
God never wills evil, but
if we have to face it,

206
00:10:29,838 --> 00:10:33,676
He gives us all the power
to defeat it, child.

207
00:10:36,011 --> 00:10:38,346
[soft music]

208
00:10:40,816 --> 00:10:42,985
[Student] I gotta
tell ya something.

209
00:10:43,018 --> 00:10:45,487
[eerie music]

210
00:10:50,859 --> 00:10:52,525
No, no, leave
him alone, Father.

211
00:10:52,527 --> 00:10:54,029
Please.

212
00:10:54,062 --> 00:10:54,863
Stephen.

213
00:10:55,998 --> 00:10:57,363
Don't go, Stephen.

214
00:10:57,365 --> 00:10:58,166
Stephen.

215
00:11:00,202 --> 00:11:02,905
[tires squealing]

216
00:11:04,907 --> 00:11:06,675
Michelle, are you all right?

217
00:11:06,709 --> 00:11:08,709
Yes, yes, I think so.

218
00:11:08,711 --> 00:11:09,978
[Joseph] Oh God.

219
00:11:10,012 --> 00:11:11,177
Grandfather, what
are you doing here?

220
00:11:11,179 --> 00:11:12,378
I'm sorry.

221
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:15,050
I'm taking my last exam.

222
00:11:15,083 --> 00:11:19,219
I have my ordination and
orientation on Sunday.

223
00:11:19,221 --> 00:11:20,555
And I'm late.

224
00:11:20,589 --> 00:11:21,423
Listen.

225
00:11:22,658 --> 00:11:23,489
Yu have a good day.

226
00:11:23,491 --> 00:11:24,324
You're sure you're okay?

227
00:11:24,326 --> 00:11:25,158
I'm fine.

228
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:26,059
I'll see you Sunday.

229
00:11:26,061 --> 00:11:27,060
[Joseph] I'll see you Sunday.

230
00:11:27,062 --> 00:11:27,894
Okay.

231
00:11:27,896 --> 00:11:29,264
Sweetie?

232
00:11:29,331 --> 00:11:33,001
Next time you look where
you're going, okay?

233
00:11:35,103 --> 00:11:37,673
[wind howling]

234
00:11:44,913 --> 00:11:47,549
[door creaking]

235
00:11:48,684 --> 00:11:51,453
[whistle blowing]

236
00:11:52,921 --> 00:11:54,788
[Cheerleader] One, two,
three, four, five, six, seven.

237
00:11:54,790 --> 00:11:56,692
As you can see our
curriculum extends

238
00:11:56,725 --> 00:12:00,093
well beyond the pulpit
and the classroom.

239
00:12:00,095 --> 00:12:01,363
[Boy] I wanna do that.

240
00:12:01,396 --> 00:12:03,231
Monsignor, can I
be a cheerleader?

241
00:12:03,265 --> 00:12:04,765
[Monsignor] Can
you be a cheerleader?

242
00:12:04,767 --> 00:12:06,299
How 'bout a linebacker?

243
00:12:06,301 --> 00:12:07,600
Do they dance?

244
00:12:07,602 --> 00:12:09,604
Sometimes when they win.

245
00:12:09,638 --> 00:12:11,638
I wanna be that girl.

246
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:12,939
Well you can be a cheerleader

247
00:12:12,941 --> 00:12:15,978
and you can just be yourself.

248
00:12:16,044 --> 00:12:17,379
You feel free to look around

249
00:12:17,412 --> 00:12:20,248
and stop by my office
on the way out.

250
00:12:20,282 --> 00:12:21,581
Let's do it again.

251
00:12:21,583 --> 00:12:22,883
All right girls,
one more time.

252
00:12:22,885 --> 00:12:24,217
More energy.

253
00:12:24,219 --> 00:12:25,886
Five, six, seven, eight.

254
00:12:25,888 --> 00:12:28,556
I personally thought
they were very good.

255
00:12:28,590 --> 00:12:30,590
[Carol] That's why you're
not a dance instructor.

256
00:12:30,592 --> 00:12:32,125
[Alexa] And one, two,
three four, five, six.

257
00:12:32,127 --> 00:12:33,996
And one, two, three, four.

258
00:12:34,062 --> 00:12:35,295
Keep going on the whistle.

259
00:12:35,297 --> 00:12:36,498
Do not stop until you
hear the whistle blow.

260
00:12:36,564 --> 00:12:37,397
Let's go.

261
00:12:37,399 --> 00:12:38,398
Let's go.

262
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:39,768
Oscar.

263
00:12:39,802 --> 00:12:40,934
Tempo, tempo.

264
00:12:40,936 --> 00:12:42,135
[Man] Bounce,
bounce, bounce, bounce.

265
00:12:42,137 --> 00:12:43,271
Go.

266
00:12:43,305 --> 00:12:44,137
Hey, no.

267
00:12:44,139 --> 00:12:45,071
Get him over there.

268
00:12:45,073 --> 00:12:46,172
Get.

269
00:12:46,174 --> 00:12:47,009
Down.

270
00:12:52,848 --> 00:12:54,347
[whistle blowing]

271
00:12:54,349 --> 00:12:56,584
Stephen, why aren't
you out there practicing?

272
00:12:56,618 --> 00:12:57,450
Stephen?

273
00:12:57,452 --> 00:12:59,454
[energetic music]

274
00:12:59,487 --> 00:13:00,286
Coach.

275
00:13:00,288 --> 00:13:01,688
[Randy] Father.

276
00:13:01,690 --> 00:13:02,522
Have a good practice.

277
00:13:02,524 --> 00:13:03,356
Thank you.

278
00:13:03,358 --> 00:13:04,760
Hey, let's go.

279
00:13:04,793 --> 00:13:05,625
Stephen.

280
00:13:05,627 --> 00:13:06,960
Hey.

281
00:13:06,962 --> 00:13:08,661
Come on, let's go.

282
00:13:08,663 --> 00:13:09,495
Come on.

283
00:13:09,497 --> 00:13:10,632
Let's go.

284
00:13:10,665 --> 00:13:12,966
Gimme this, will ya?

285
00:13:12,968 --> 00:13:14,000
Phone, gimme the phone.

286
00:13:14,002 --> 00:13:15,168
Come on.

287
00:13:15,170 --> 00:13:16,772
Okay look.

288
00:13:16,805 --> 00:13:18,638
Line boogey.

289
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:19,672
290 Z.

290
00:13:19,674 --> 00:13:20,508
All right?

291
00:13:21,376 --> 00:13:23,311
Hey, you got this.

292
00:13:23,345 --> 00:13:24,945
Let's go.

293
00:13:24,947 --> 00:13:26,780
Show them what you can do.

294
00:13:26,782 --> 00:13:29,184
[soft music]

295
00:13:30,719 --> 00:13:32,154
How's it going?

296
00:13:33,355 --> 00:13:36,792
Well, I'm trying to
get Stephen to step up.

297
00:13:37,692 --> 00:13:38,861
Line boogey.

298
00:13:39,728 --> 00:13:41,329
290 ZX.

299
00:13:41,363 --> 00:13:43,563
All right, guys,
line boogey 290ZX.

300
00:13:43,565 --> 00:13:45,398
Line boogey 290ZX.

301
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:46,232
Ready.

302
00:13:46,234 --> 00:13:47,469
[All] Break.

303
00:13:47,502 --> 00:13:50,203
Did you make it
to mass last Sunday?

304
00:13:50,205 --> 00:13:51,639
No I talked to Jesus about it,

305
00:13:51,673 --> 00:13:54,407
but he told me to sleep in.

306
00:13:54,409 --> 00:13:55,375
Okay, watch this, watch this.

307
00:13:55,377 --> 00:13:57,712
[soft music]

308
00:14:03,518 --> 00:14:04,350
Yes, Stephen, yes.

309
00:14:04,352 --> 00:14:05,185
[whistle blowing]

310
00:14:05,187 --> 00:14:06,352
Way to see it, yes.

311
00:14:06,354 --> 00:14:08,054
That's the way, that's the way.

312
00:14:08,056 --> 00:14:10,525
If that boy's focus
matched his talent,

313
00:14:10,558 --> 00:14:13,059
he'd be an all league
candidate next year.

314
00:14:13,061 --> 00:14:14,096
[whistle blowing]

315
00:14:14,162 --> 00:14:15,328
[Randy] Okay.

316
00:14:15,330 --> 00:14:18,700
Ben, watch his
waist, not his feet.

317
00:14:18,733 --> 00:14:20,666
[Quarterback] On the one.

318
00:14:20,668 --> 00:14:21,703
Hut, hut.

00:14:21,736 --> 00:14:24,437
[heartbeat pounding]

320
00:14:24,439 --> 00:14:26,208
I'll get you bitch.

321
00:14:26,241 --> 00:14:27,908
Hey faggot.

322
00:14:27,910 --> 00:14:28,844
What are you
wearing to practice?

323
00:14:28,877 --> 00:14:30,010
[Alexa] Stop it, you idiot.

324
00:14:30,012 --> 00:14:31,679
[Ben] No one here to stop me.

325
00:14:31,713 --> 00:14:33,179
[Randy] What's with
the black nail polish?

326
00:14:33,181 --> 00:14:34,080
[Father DuMal] Come with me.

327
00:14:34,082 --> 00:14:35,081
We'll address your troubles.

328
00:14:35,083 --> 00:14:36,749
[Quarterback] On the one.

329
00:14:36,751 --> 00:14:39,752
[Ben] He's the
devil, Sister Clare.

330
00:14:39,754 --> 00:14:41,123
[Sister Clare] You
will go to confession

331
00:14:41,189 --> 00:14:42,690
for the entire second period.

332
00:14:42,724 --> 00:14:47,729
[heartbeat pounding]
[soft music]

333
00:14:51,699 --> 00:14:54,069

334
00:15:00,442 --> 00:15:01,274
[whistle blowing]

335
00:15:01,276 --> 00:15:02,275
That's targeting.

336
00:15:02,277 --> 00:15:03,578
[whistle blowing]

337
00:15:03,611 --> 00:15:04,945
[Stephen] That's for
my sister, you bitch.

338
00:15:04,947 --> 00:15:06,915
[Randy] Hey, hey, Ben, Ben.

339
00:15:06,949 --> 00:15:08,148
You all right?

340
00:15:08,150 --> 00:15:10,652
[eerie music]

341
00:15:26,501 --> 00:15:27,402
Nice hit.

342
00:15:29,471 --> 00:15:33,976
This game is about scoring
points not settling scores.

343
00:15:35,610 --> 00:15:37,645
Catch the ball next time.

344
00:15:39,181 --> 00:15:41,848
[eerie music]

345
00:15:41,850 --> 00:15:42,682
Good.

346
00:15:42,684 --> 00:15:44,150
You're good, let's go.

347
00:15:44,152 --> 00:15:46,588
[Alexa] One, two, three,
four, five, six, seven, eight.

348
00:15:46,621 --> 00:15:50,323
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

349
00:15:50,325 --> 00:15:52,760
That is not how we
play football here.

350
00:15:52,794 --> 00:15:54,296
You understand me?

351
00:15:55,530 --> 00:15:56,362
Come on, let's go.

352
00:15:56,364 --> 00:15:57,197
Laps.

353
00:15:57,199 --> 00:15:58,133
Laps, come on.

354
00:15:58,166 --> 00:15:58,965
Laps, laps, laps, laps, laps.

355
00:15:58,967 --> 00:16:00,135
Let's go, let's go.

356
00:16:00,168 --> 00:16:01,269
Little hustle.

357
00:16:03,872 --> 00:16:05,473
[Monsignor] Is he all right?

358
00:16:05,507 --> 00:16:06,339
[Randy] He's a
football player.

359
00:16:06,341 --> 00:16:08,008
He'll be fine.

360
00:16:08,010 --> 00:16:09,611
Got what was coming to him.

361
00:16:09,644 --> 00:16:11,813
Oh yeah, I know.

362
00:16:11,846 --> 00:16:14,216
[soft music]

363
00:16:20,956 --> 00:16:23,456
This is the proudest
day of my whole life.

364
00:16:23,458 --> 00:16:26,626
[soft music]

365
00:16:26,628 --> 00:16:27,462
Our life.

366
00:16:28,863 --> 00:16:31,797
This is your day, Joseph.

367
00:16:31,799 --> 00:16:35,470
If I could, I would not
take anything from you.

368
00:16:35,503 --> 00:16:38,673
I spent most of my life
working for the church.

369
00:16:38,706 --> 00:16:42,708
Without you, I never
could've gotten so far.

370
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:45,080
[soft music]

371
00:16:45,147 --> 00:16:47,647
In a few months, it's
our 50th anniversary

372
00:16:47,649 --> 00:16:52,485
and that will be the
happiest day for our family.

373
00:16:52,487 --> 00:16:54,856
[soft music]

374
00:17:06,001 --> 00:17:07,702
Grandfather Joseph.

375
00:17:09,271 --> 00:17:10,505
Hey.

376
00:17:10,538 --> 00:17:11,371
Hey.

377
00:17:11,373 --> 00:17:12,207
Alexa.

378
00:17:13,241 --> 00:17:15,077
You're so beautiful.

379
00:17:15,110 --> 00:17:16,444
Michelle, my baby.

380
00:17:16,511 --> 00:17:18,611
God bless you, Michelle.

381
00:17:18,613 --> 00:17:19,547
Hi dad.

382
00:17:19,581 --> 00:17:21,714
I am such a blessed man.

383
00:17:21,716 --> 00:17:23,383
Look at the four
beautiful women.

384
00:17:23,385 --> 00:17:24,886
And now two.

385
00:17:24,919 --> 00:17:26,252
Two granddaughters.

386
00:17:26,254 --> 00:17:27,187
Yes indeed.

387
00:17:27,189 --> 00:17:28,088
How are you, how are you?

388
00:17:28,090 --> 00:17:28,890
[Joseph] Randy, God bless you.

389
00:17:28,923 --> 00:17:29,722
Thank you for coming.

390
00:17:29,724 --> 00:17:30,523
Congratulations.

391
00:17:30,525 --> 00:17:31,726
Great to see you.

392
00:17:31,759 --> 00:17:32,558
[Joseph] Oh wow,
how you girls doing?

393
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:33,459
Oh, we're okay.

394
00:17:33,461 --> 00:17:34,127
[Michelle] Yeah, we're good.

395
00:17:34,129 --> 00:17:35,297
[Joseph] Yeah.

396
00:17:35,363 --> 00:17:36,029
[Alexa] You excited
for your big day?

397
00:17:36,031 --> 00:17:37,130
Am I excited?

398
00:17:37,132 --> 00:17:38,631
Yeah.

399
00:17:38,633 --> 00:17:40,735
Come on, this is a great
honor for you, grandfather.

400
00:17:40,768 --> 00:17:42,235
Well you keep up
your Bible studies,

401
00:17:42,237 --> 00:17:44,404
you'll be right
behind me, sweetie.

402
00:17:44,406 --> 00:17:45,240
Stephen.

403
00:17:47,542 --> 00:17:48,776
Hey, come on.

404
00:17:49,777 --> 00:17:50,610
Little pep, buddy, little pep.

405
00:17:50,612 --> 00:17:51,446
Stephen.

406
00:17:52,981 --> 00:17:54,147
You look great, pal.

407
00:17:54,149 --> 00:17:56,484
What the hell is his problem?

408
00:17:56,551 --> 00:17:57,552
It's okay.

409
00:17:59,121 --> 00:18:00,786
Stephen, don't be rude.

410
00:18:00,788 --> 00:18:01,621
You greet your grandfather.

411
00:18:01,623 --> 00:18:02,824
Sorry.

412
00:18:02,890 --> 00:18:03,556
[Joseph] You know
how it is, don't you?

413
00:18:03,558 --> 00:18:04,124
Yeah, I do.

414
00:18:04,126 --> 00:18:04,957
I do.

415
00:18:04,959 --> 00:18:06,995
[eerie music]

416
00:18:07,062 --> 00:18:08,728
Don't be so distant.

417
00:18:08,730 --> 00:18:11,233
[eerie music]

418
00:18:13,135 --> 00:18:14,767
We are blood.

419
00:18:14,769 --> 00:18:16,736
Joseph has sacrificed himself

420
00:18:16,738 --> 00:18:19,639
for our church for many years.

421
00:18:19,641 --> 00:18:22,244
His devotion to
bringing God's children

422
00:18:22,277 --> 00:18:24,512
into our fold is unequaled.

423
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:29,784
He's nurtured our boys to
adolescence into manhood,

424
00:18:29,817 --> 00:18:31,984
even sometimes delivering them

425
00:18:31,986 --> 00:18:36,158
to the church's greatest
blessing, the priesthood.

426
00:18:37,992 --> 00:18:40,995
If we could award
a greater accolade

427
00:18:42,330 --> 00:18:45,598
than the Diaconate
on Joseph, we would,

428
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:49,202
but I know that
Joseph's greatest reward

429
00:18:49,204 --> 00:18:52,374
is our Lord's respect and love.

430
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:55,477
On behalf of our
church, the Vatican,

431
00:18:57,512 --> 00:19:01,116
and all its dominions,
we thank you, Joseph.

432
00:19:03,318 --> 00:19:07,520
[Joseph] Monsignor, your
words and praise were too much.

433
00:19:07,522 --> 00:19:09,855
I don't deserve this.

434
00:19:09,857 --> 00:19:12,294
Stephen, what's the matter?

435
00:19:14,562 --> 00:19:17,165
Lamb of God who taketh
away the sins of the world,

436
00:19:17,199 --> 00:19:19,199
have mercy on us.

437
00:19:19,201 --> 00:19:22,034
Lamb of God who taketh away
the sings of the world,

438
00:19:22,036 --> 00:19:23,805
have mercy on us.

439
00:19:23,838 --> 00:19:27,540
Lamb of God who taketh
away the sins of the world,

440
00:19:27,542 --> 00:19:28,743
grant us peace.

441
00:19:30,478 --> 00:19:34,046
Now I'll ask that we
all approach the altar

442
00:19:34,048 --> 00:19:36,751
in order to receive
the body of Christ.

443
00:19:36,818 --> 00:19:40,522
As Deacon, this will
be Joseph's first time

444
00:19:40,555 --> 00:19:42,557
providing the Eucharist.

445
00:19:43,591 --> 00:19:45,558
The body of Christ.

446
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:47,662
[Monsignor] The
body of Christ.

447
00:19:47,695 --> 00:19:48,894
[Joseph] The body of Christ.

448
00:19:48,896 --> 00:19:50,098
Amen.

449
00:19:50,165 --> 00:19:52,265
[Monsignor] The
body of Christ.

450
00:19:52,267 --> 00:19:54,100
The body of Christ.

451
00:19:54,102 --> 00:19:55,870
The body of Christ.

452
00:19:57,071 --> 00:19:57,837
[Monsignor] The
body of Christ.

453
00:19:57,839 --> 00:19:58,904
Amen.

454
00:19:58,906 --> 00:20:01,409
[eerie music]

455
00:20:03,911 --> 00:20:07,081
[Monsignor] The
body of Christ.

456
00:20:07,115 --> 00:20:08,850
The body of Christ.

457
00:20:08,883 --> 00:20:11,386
[eerie music]

458
00:20:14,088 --> 00:20:15,921
The body of Christ.

459
00:20:15,923 --> 00:20:18,426
[eerie music]

460
00:20:27,235 --> 00:20:28,768
Amen.

461
00:20:28,770 --> 00:20:31,139
[soft music]

462
00:20:34,476 --> 00:20:36,077
The body of Christ.

463
00:20:37,279 --> 00:20:38,880
[Monsignor] The
body of Christ.

464
00:20:38,913 --> 00:20:41,383
[eerie music]

465
00:20:42,384 --> 00:20:44,650
[Joseph] The body of Christ.

466
00:20:44,652 --> 00:20:47,121
[eerie music]

467
00:21:10,111 --> 00:21:11,477
[Monsignor] Lamb of
God who taketh away

468
00:21:11,479 --> 00:21:12,614
the sins of the world.

469
00:21:12,647 --> 00:21:15,317
[ominous music]

470
00:21:27,495 --> 00:21:31,433
[speaking in foreign language]

471
00:21:33,601 --> 00:21:34,969
The mass has ended.

472
00:21:35,002 --> 00:21:36,602
Go in peace.

473
00:21:36,604 --> 00:21:38,973
[soft music]

474
00:21:47,114 --> 00:21:48,681
[Alexa] Do we really have
to go on this stupid trip?

475
00:21:48,683 --> 00:21:49,517
I had a date.

476
00:21:49,551 --> 00:21:51,152
Yes, you do.

477
00:21:51,185 --> 00:21:52,685
Come on.

478
00:21:52,687 --> 00:21:53,955
The lake house is where your
grandparents were married

479
00:21:53,988 --> 00:21:56,155
and it's gonna mean a
lot to your grandmother

480
00:21:56,157 --> 00:21:57,623
to have us all there.

481
00:21:57,625 --> 00:21:59,024
It's the anniversary, okay.

482
00:21:59,026 --> 00:22:00,693
Look, it'll be fun.

483
00:22:00,695 --> 00:22:01,963
You're gonna see your cousins.

484
00:22:01,996 --> 00:22:05,166
You're gonna enjoy my
brilliant barbecuing.

485
00:22:05,199 --> 00:22:06,131
That's right.

486
00:22:06,133 --> 00:22:07,502
I don't know what's worse.

487
00:22:07,535 --> 00:22:09,669
The cousins, your barbecuing,
or that creepy house.

488
00:22:09,671 --> 00:22:11,172
That's funny.

489
00:22:11,205 --> 00:22:12,338
That's what Stephen used to
call it when he was little.

490
00:22:12,340 --> 00:22:13,239
That's what he called it?

491
00:22:13,241 --> 00:22:14,073
- Mm.
- Mm.

492
00:22:14,075 --> 00:22:14,907
- Mm.
- Mm.

493
00:22:14,909 --> 00:22:16,344
God, ew.

494
00:22:16,378 --> 00:22:17,910
Ew, ew.

495
00:22:17,912 --> 00:22:18,846
[Emily] Okay, I'm gonna go see

496
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:19,579
what's keeping mom and Michelle.

497
00:22:19,581 --> 00:22:20,848
[Randy] Okay.

498
00:22:31,259 --> 00:22:32,093
Emily.

499
00:22:34,028 --> 00:22:37,029
It's been six years since
he left you and the twins.

500
00:22:37,031 --> 00:22:39,367
Isn't six years long enough

501
00:22:39,401 --> 00:22:41,901
to find forgiveness
in your heart?

502
00:22:41,903 --> 00:22:43,605
He never left.

503
00:22:43,671 --> 00:22:44,504
Let's go.

504
00:22:44,506 --> 00:22:45,338
Come on, ladies.

505
00:22:45,340 --> 00:22:46,339
Let's go.

506
00:22:46,341 --> 00:22:48,710
[soft music]

507
00:22:51,245 --> 00:22:52,211
Let's go, ladies.

508
00:22:52,213 --> 00:22:53,045
Let's go.

509
00:22:53,047 --> 00:22:53,879
Thank you, thank you.

510
00:22:53,881 --> 00:22:54,714
Let's go.

511
00:22:54,716 --> 00:22:56,015
Coming.

512
00:22:56,017 --> 00:22:57,116
It would be nice to
get there before dark.

513
00:22:57,118 --> 00:22:58,584
Thank you.

514
00:22:58,586 --> 00:23:00,422
Help you out over here.

515
00:23:02,690 --> 00:23:04,191
Stephen, hey.

516
00:23:04,225 --> 00:23:05,391
I am not listening
to that awful music

517
00:23:05,393 --> 00:23:06,626
for the next two hours.

518
00:23:06,628 --> 00:23:07,695
That's the kind of
music the devil uses

519
00:23:07,729 --> 00:23:08,694
to possess your body.

520
00:23:08,696 --> 00:23:09,897
I don't know about possession,

521
00:23:09,931 --> 00:23:11,597
but it might make
his eyeliner darker.

522
00:23:11,599 --> 00:23:12,600
Yeah, we got
proof right there.

523
00:23:12,634 --> 00:23:14,469
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

524
00:23:14,536 --> 00:23:15,370
Hey.

525
00:23:17,104 --> 00:23:18,771
Everybody just chill out.

526
00:23:18,773 --> 00:23:21,374
Got a long ride ahead of us.

527
00:23:21,376 --> 00:23:22,243
Let's go.

528
00:23:22,276 --> 00:23:24,744
[soft music]

529
00:23:24,746 --> 00:23:25,778
After you.

530
00:23:25,780 --> 00:23:28,149
[soft music]

531
00:23:52,774 --> 00:23:53,606
[hand knocking]

532
00:23:53,608 --> 00:23:54,442
Come.

533
00:23:57,812 --> 00:23:59,280
I said come.

534
00:23:59,313 --> 00:24:01,649
[soft music]

535
00:24:14,662 --> 00:24:17,331
[ominous music]

536
00:24:54,502 --> 00:24:55,701
[Alexa] Two weekends from now,

537
00:24:55,703 --> 00:24:57,872
I'm gonna take you
out to a party.

538
00:24:57,905 --> 00:24:59,073
To a party.

539
00:24:59,140 --> 00:25:02,309
[Michelle] That's
not gonna go very well.

540
00:25:05,046 --> 00:25:06,078
I wouldn't be comfortable.

541
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:07,248
[Alexa] You're gonna love it.

542
00:25:07,314 --> 00:25:08,483
[Randy] We're
gonna throw a party.

543
00:25:08,516 --> 00:25:09,181
We're gonna throw a
party at the house next.

544
00:25:09,183 --> 00:25:11,586
[soft music]

545
00:25:29,571 --> 00:25:31,506
It's a beautiful day.

546
00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:34,576
All right, let's get
this truck unloaded.

547
00:25:34,609 --> 00:25:38,243
Tomorrow we party but tonight,
we chill and get some rest.

548
00:25:38,245 --> 00:25:39,078
I'm gonna go for a swim.

549
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:39,912
No, no, no, no, no.

550
00:25:39,914 --> 00:25:41,415
We need your help.

551
00:25:42,383 --> 00:25:43,217
Stephen.

552
00:25:44,418 --> 00:25:46,721
We need your help.

553
00:25:46,754 --> 00:25:48,554
All right, don't
expect anything else.

554
00:25:48,556 --> 00:25:50,122
I don't understand how
you guys can be twins.

555
00:25:50,124 --> 00:25:52,960
You guys are nothing
alike at all.

556
00:25:54,361 --> 00:25:55,530
Michelle, guess what?

557
00:25:55,563 --> 00:25:56,462
Thank you.

558
00:25:56,464 --> 00:25:57,131
- Appreciate it.
- Got it.

559
00:25:57,198 --> 00:25:58,297
Yup.

560
00:25:58,299 --> 00:25:59,233
Yup, don't worry about it.

561
00:25:59,266 --> 00:26:00,566
Dad's got the rest of it.

562
00:26:00,568 --> 00:26:01,400
Stop complaining.

563
00:26:01,402 --> 00:26:02,234
You're big and strong.

564
00:26:02,236 --> 00:26:03,068
Come on.

565
00:26:03,070 --> 00:26:04,438
Always the way.

566
00:26:12,379 --> 00:26:14,582
[Emily] Stephen, come on.

567
00:26:27,595 --> 00:26:30,329
[Father DuMal] Always
been drawn to this place.

568
00:26:30,331 --> 00:26:31,666
Yes, you have.

569
00:26:37,271 --> 00:26:39,304
Where's Monsignor Canell?

570
00:26:39,306 --> 00:26:40,806
I'm sorry.

571
00:26:40,808 --> 00:26:42,744
He couldn't make it, but
he sends his well wishes.

572
00:26:42,777 --> 00:26:43,945
Ah.

573
00:26:43,978 --> 00:26:45,477
Well, Rosemary will
be disappointed,

574
00:26:45,479 --> 00:26:49,081
but I know it means a lot to
her that you're both here.

575
00:26:49,083 --> 00:26:49,982
Enjoy.

576
00:26:49,984 --> 00:26:50,785
[Father DuMal] Thank you.

577
00:26:50,818 --> 00:26:52,253
Hello, Rosemary.

578
00:26:53,487 --> 00:26:55,322
Hello, Sister Clare.

579
00:26:58,092 --> 00:26:59,759
Boys versus girls.

580
00:26:59,761 --> 00:27:03,696
Except for what team is
Stephen gonna play on?

581
00:27:03,698 --> 00:27:05,800
That's not funny, guys.

582
00:27:05,833 --> 00:27:07,166
Yes, it is.

583
00:27:07,168 --> 00:27:09,434
He just expresses
himself differently.

584
00:27:09,436 --> 00:27:10,772
[Cousin] Okay.

585
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:13,708
Rosemary.

586
00:27:14,876 --> 00:27:16,944
It's a bittersweet
day, isn't it?

587
00:27:16,978 --> 00:27:17,812
For who?

588
00:27:18,813 --> 00:27:19,645
[Father DuMal] For...

589
00:27:19,647 --> 00:27:20,479
I know who you meant.

590
00:27:20,481 --> 00:27:23,150
[ominous music]

591
00:27:30,324 --> 00:27:33,559
What are you guys staring at?

592
00:27:33,561 --> 00:27:34,962
The past.

593
00:27:34,996 --> 00:27:36,163
Okay.

594
00:27:36,197 --> 00:27:37,362
Whatever.

595
00:27:37,364 --> 00:27:42,003
[ominous music]
[heartbeat pounding]

596
00:27:46,407 --> 00:27:47,842
Is it finished?

597
00:27:49,210 --> 00:27:50,042
Come on, Stephen.

598
00:27:50,044 --> 00:27:51,979
Show him what you got.

599
00:27:52,013 --> 00:27:53,345
[soft music]

600
00:27:53,347 --> 00:27:54,181
No.

601
00:27:55,216 --> 00:27:56,651
It can't, can it?

602
00:27:58,552 --> 00:28:00,722
Because they will remember.

603
00:28:03,658 --> 00:28:06,327
[ominous music]

604
00:28:26,781 --> 00:28:28,182
Fine, no problem.

605
00:28:28,215 --> 00:28:31,452
We'll play O'Connor's
versus Younger's.

606
00:28:39,260 --> 00:28:44,265
[soft music]
[heartbeat pounding]

607

[eerie music]
[heartbeat pounding]

608
00:29:14,061 --> 00:29:15,560
All right, we know
what we're doing, right?

609
00:29:15,562 --> 00:29:16,996
Oh yeah.

610
00:29:16,998 --> 00:29:18,565
And if you run like your
mother, we'll be fine.

611
00:29:18,599 --> 00:29:19,431
You remember the plan?

612
00:29:19,433 --> 00:29:21,133
If not, ask her.

613
00:29:21,135 --> 00:29:22,069
Okay guys.

614
00:29:22,103 --> 00:29:23,102
[Randy] Alexa, help us out.

615
00:29:23,104 --> 00:29:24,303
[Alexa] Got it.

616
00:29:24,305 --> 00:29:24,970
Here we go, here
we go, Stephen.

617
00:29:24,972 --> 00:29:25,773
Hey baby.

618
00:29:25,807 --> 00:29:26,471
[Randy] Hey baby.

619
00:29:26,473 --> 00:29:27,740
Here we go.

620
00:29:27,742 --> 00:29:28,943
[Joseph] Hey ho,
hey, hey, hey, ho.

621
00:29:28,976 --> 00:29:30,075
Let's go, hike
the ball already.

622
00:29:30,077 --> 00:29:31,410
Hike the ball already.

623
00:29:31,412 --> 00:29:32,244
Come on.

624
00:29:32,246 --> 00:29:33,078
Let's go.

625
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:33,915
[Joseph] Hike, hike.

626
00:29:33,948 --> 00:29:36,317
[soft music]

627
00:29:40,654 --> 00:29:42,323
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

628
00:29:42,356 --> 00:29:44,023
[Emily] Dad, dad.

629
00:29:44,025 --> 00:29:46,358
Stephen, what did you do?

630
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:48,027
Stephen, what the
hell is your problem?

631
00:29:48,029 --> 00:29:49,363
He's an old man.

632
00:29:51,598 --> 00:29:53,432
Yo, Stephen hit him hard.

633
00:29:53,434 --> 00:29:56,804
I can't believe how hard
you hit your grandfather.

634
00:29:56,838 --> 00:30:00,139
What made you
do that, Stephen?

635
00:30:00,141 --> 00:30:01,642
I'm gonna go outside.

636
00:30:01,675 --> 00:30:04,111
[soft music]

637
00:30:09,150 --> 00:30:10,549
What's down there?

638
00:30:10,551 --> 00:30:12,386
Why is this door always locked?

639
00:30:12,453 --> 00:30:14,822
[soft music]

640
00:30:25,833 --> 00:30:30,838

[heartbeat pounding]

641
00:30:42,750 --> 00:30:44,416
Come on, Michelle.

642
00:30:44,418 --> 00:30:46,754
[soft music]

643
00:30:51,859 --> 00:30:53,993
As it is in heaven.

644
00:30:53,995 --> 00:30:56,595
Give us this day
our daily bread.

645
00:30:56,597 --> 00:30:59,333
Do you believe in heaven?

646
00:30:59,366 --> 00:31:00,101
Yes.

647
00:31:01,702 --> 00:31:02,536
I do.

648
00:31:04,738 --> 00:31:06,071
And hell?

649
00:31:06,073 --> 00:31:08,908
[soft music]

650
00:31:08,910 --> 00:31:10,742
Where's grandfather?

[soft music]

652
00:31:15,249 --> 00:31:17,518
You really think God
can hear your prayers?

653
00:31:17,551 --> 00:31:18,385
I do.

654
00:31:22,223 --> 00:31:24,423
How come he never
hears mine then?

655
00:31:24,425 --> 00:31:26,227
Oh Stephen.

656
00:31:26,260 --> 00:31:27,361
He hears you.

657
00:31:28,562 --> 00:31:30,429
Do you hear him?

658
00:31:30,431 --> 00:31:32,867
[soft music]

659
00:31:34,568 --> 00:31:36,137
I don't hear God.

660
00:31:37,638 --> 00:31:38,572
You will.

661
00:31:39,807 --> 00:31:40,641
Soon.

662
00:31:42,543 --> 00:31:47,446
All things will be revealed
to you in just a short time.

663
00:31:47,448 --> 00:31:50,451
I'll join you down
there in a second.

664
00:31:51,819 --> 00:31:53,087
Okay.

665
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:55,456
[soft music]

666
00:31:59,827 --> 00:32:01,829
You shouldn't say anymore.

667
00:32:01,896 --> 00:32:03,797
You swore on the Bible.

668
00:32:15,809 --> 00:32:18,846
When you're
forbidden to use words,

669
00:32:22,984 --> 00:32:25,019
you must rely on actions.

670
00:32:28,455 --> 00:32:29,321
Food's up.

671
00:32:29,323 --> 00:32:30,791
Food's up.

672
00:32:30,824 --> 00:32:33,425
Randy O'Connor's gourmet
burgers and dogs are served.

673
00:32:33,427 --> 00:32:34,259
Come and get it.

674
00:32:34,261 --> 00:32:35,494
Starving.

675
00:32:35,496 --> 00:32:36,497
I'm taking bets we'll
still be alive tomorrow.

676
00:32:36,530 --> 00:32:37,696
Oh?

677
00:32:37,698 --> 00:32:38,532
Oh really?

678
00:32:38,599 --> 00:32:39,766
Well, hold on.

679
00:32:41,002 --> 00:32:42,301
Serve.

680
00:32:42,303 --> 00:32:43,368
You're serving.

681
00:32:43,370 --> 00:32:44,305
Absolutely.

682
00:32:46,173 --> 00:32:48,542
[soft music]

683
00:33:03,190 --> 00:33:05,524
My beloved family.

684
00:33:05,526 --> 00:33:09,194
Thank you all for
making this journey

685
00:33:09,196 --> 00:33:12,033
and for ending
here with me today.

686
00:33:14,902 --> 00:33:18,472
After 50 years of
marriage to the same man,

687
00:33:19,706 --> 00:33:22,543
his predilections,
and his church.

688
00:33:25,913 --> 00:33:29,548
There are things I
have not spoken of

689
00:33:29,550 --> 00:33:33,387
in order to keep
this family together.

[eerie music]

691
00:33:36,157 --> 00:33:39,424
Things are not what they seem,

692
00:33:39,426 --> 00:33:42,596
but today all things
will be revealed.

693
00:33:43,830 --> 00:33:46,431
[eerie music]

694
00:33:46,433 --> 00:33:49,268
And I will ask your forgiveness.

697
00:33:56,944 --> 00:34:01,515
Thank you my heavenly father
for keeping me from harm.

698
00:34:02,683 --> 00:34:03,782
Don't do it, Rosie.

699
00:34:03,784 --> 00:34:05,286
And from danger.

700
00:34:06,687 --> 00:34:09,190
Let thy holy angel lie with me

701
00:34:10,524 --> 00:34:14,361
that the wicked foe may
have no power over me.

702
00:34:16,763 --> 00:34:18,097
Amen.

00:34:19,566 --> 00:34:20,567

00:34:21,935 --> 00:34:23,637
Are you okay?

706
00:34:23,704 --> 00:34:24,771
Yes, Emily.

707
00:34:25,706 --> 00:34:26,540
I'm fine.

708
00:34:27,641 --> 00:34:29,410
My chains are broken.

709
00:34:30,611 --> 00:34:33,112
What are you talking about?

710
00:34:33,114 --> 00:34:34,948
Have courage, Emily.

711
00:34:36,450 --> 00:34:38,150
Don't drown it.

00:34:48,329 --> 00:34:49,263
Okay.

714
00:34:49,296 --> 00:34:50,497
Dessert anyone?

715
00:34:52,266 --> 00:34:53,098
Let's just clear the plates.

716
00:34:53,100 --> 00:34:53,932
Come on, kids.

717
00:34:53,934 --> 00:34:55,436
Help clear please.

718
00:35:02,743 --> 00:35:04,009
They were mine the
moment they were born.

Get down from there.

00:36:34,601 --> 00:36:36,235
[Randy] Okay,
okay, okay, okay.

743
00:36:36,237 --> 00:36:38,605
[soft music]

744
00:37:03,464 --> 00:37:06,633
I think we should
let them be alone.

745
00:37:15,209 --> 00:37:17,711
[eerie music]

746
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:28,455
What was that?

747
00:37:29,456 --> 00:37:30,724
What did I see?

748
00:37:32,459 --> 00:37:33,727
I don't know.

749
00:37:34,828 --> 00:37:36,663
I see it all the time.

750
00:37:40,301 --> 00:37:42,303
That really scared me.

751
00:37:44,070 --> 00:37:46,940
[thunder rumbling]

752
00:37:54,815 --> 00:37:56,650
Don't let it.

753
00:37:56,683 --> 00:37:59,651
I'll always take care of you.

754
00:37:59,653 --> 00:38:01,087
You always have.

755
00:38:04,024 --> 00:38:05,490
Yea though I walk
through the valley

756
00:38:05,492 --> 00:38:07,160
of the shadow of death.

757
00:38:07,194 --> 00:38:09,160
I will fear no evil.

758
00:38:09,162 --> 00:38:11,198
For thou are with me.

759
00:38:11,265 --> 00:38:14,268
My rod and my staff
they comfort me.

760
00:38:15,336 --> 00:38:16,169
Amen.

761
00:38:17,671 --> 00:38:21,039
Now Michelle has a special
prayer for her grandmother

762
00:38:21,041 --> 00:38:22,776
and we will end with that.

763
00:38:22,809 --> 00:38:24,042
Michelle.

764
00:38:24,044 --> 00:38:26,480
[soft music]

765
00:38:28,682 --> 00:38:31,850
Help me, Lord, to understand
this mysterious death

766
00:38:31,852 --> 00:38:33,718
and to be healed by your grace

767
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:35,889
and made whole once again.

768
00:38:38,359 --> 00:38:40,959
May the soul of my
tormented grandmother

769
00:38:40,961 --> 00:38:45,699
find in the savior's love
forgiveness and reconciliation.

770
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:50,136
Lord in your mercy,
hear my prayer.

771
00:38:52,172 --> 00:38:53,006
Amen.

772
00:38:54,007 --> 00:38:55,676
Thank you, Michelle.

773
00:39:00,547 --> 00:39:04,749
My sincerest sympathies
to you and to your family.

774
00:39:04,751 --> 00:39:06,587
Rosemary was a wonderful woman

775
00:39:06,653 --> 00:39:09,388
and it's a very great loss.

776
00:39:09,390 --> 00:39:12,025
I'm very worried
about Stephen.

777
00:39:12,058 --> 00:39:14,659
He was very close
with his grandparents.

778
00:39:14,661 --> 00:39:17,030
When are you planning
to return home?

779
00:39:17,063 --> 00:39:19,063
I'd like to gather her
friends at the church

780
00:39:19,065 --> 00:39:21,067
for a farewell ceremony.

781
00:39:22,536 --> 00:39:24,869
That would be lovely.

782
00:39:24,871 --> 00:39:26,905
We have to pack
Rosemary's things

783
00:39:26,907 --> 00:39:28,509
and go through her paperwork,

784
00:39:28,542 --> 00:39:31,843
but it shouldn't be
more than a few days.

785
00:39:31,845 --> 00:39:33,412
All right, well
if you need guidance

786
00:39:33,414 --> 00:39:38,419
or you just wanna talk, don't
hesitate to call me all right.

787
00:39:39,185 --> 00:39:39,951
Thank you, Monsignor.

788
00:39:39,953 --> 00:39:41,586
You're welcome.

789
00:39:41,588 --> 00:39:44,090
[eerie music]

790
00:39:45,258 --> 00:39:46,257
Monsignor.

791
00:39:46,259 --> 00:39:48,762
[eerie music]

792
00:39:55,802 --> 00:39:58,405
There's a lot of
bad energy here.

793
00:39:58,439 --> 00:40:00,305
You should get going
as soon as possible.

794
00:40:00,307 --> 00:40:01,742
We will.

795
00:40:01,775 --> 00:40:03,444
We should go inside.

796
00:40:05,111 --> 00:40:06,044
Okay.

797
00:40:06,046 --> 00:40:07,979
And we're gonna get going.

798
00:40:07,981 --> 00:40:11,316
But just remember, we're
here for your family.

799
00:40:11,318 --> 00:40:13,720
[soft music]

800
00:40:18,124 --> 00:40:20,126
I'm weighted by guilt.

801
00:40:21,728 --> 00:40:23,430
What guilt, Sister?

802
00:40:25,265 --> 00:40:26,132
Rosemary.

803
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:28,502
The torment.

804
00:40:28,569 --> 00:40:29,403
The soul.

805
00:40:31,805 --> 00:40:34,341
We will pray for her soul.

806
00:40:34,408 --> 00:40:36,910
And you are innocent
of any wrongdoing.

807
00:40:36,943 --> 00:40:37,809
You have been a
good friend to her.

808
00:40:37,811 --> 00:40:39,245
Not a friend.

809
00:40:39,279 --> 00:40:41,179
Not a friend.

810
00:40:41,181 --> 00:40:44,017
A friend would have spoken
the truth years ago.

811
00:40:44,084 --> 00:40:46,687
Speak the truth to me, Sister.

812
00:40:50,323 --> 00:40:54,695
I don't have the strength
to face those demons now.

813
00:40:57,163 --> 00:40:58,298
I pray you do.

814
00:41:00,300 --> 00:41:02,102
Sister Clare please.

815
00:41:04,104 --> 00:41:05,704
Takes everything.

816
00:41:05,706 --> 00:41:08,108
[soft music]

817
00:41:09,009 --> 00:41:09,876
Do you see?

818
00:41:12,446 --> 00:41:13,480
Help me to.

819
00:41:16,182 --> 00:41:17,350
I am trying.

820
00:41:20,353 --> 00:41:24,124
Stephen, Michelle,
come inside please.

821
00:41:24,157 --> 00:41:26,493
[soft music]

822
00:41:26,527 --> 00:41:29,961
It's like talking
to a brick wall.

823
00:41:29,963 --> 00:41:32,964
I don't know how to reach him.

824
00:41:32,966 --> 00:41:35,800
Just keep your heart open.

825
00:41:35,802 --> 00:41:39,339
Only the truth will
heal his troubled soul.

826
00:41:40,206 --> 00:41:42,876
[ominous music]

827
00:41:52,486 --> 00:41:54,819
Why is it so cold in here?

828
00:41:54,821 --> 00:41:56,054
[Randy] I don't know.

829
00:41:56,056 --> 00:41:57,323
The thermostat is up
as high as it can go.

830
00:41:57,357 --> 00:41:58,723
Then why is it
so freaking cold?

831
00:41:58,725 --> 00:42:00,260
[Randy] I don't know.

832
00:42:00,326 --> 00:42:02,393
Is Stephen still
locked in his room?

833
00:42:02,395 --> 00:42:03,227
Yeah.

834
00:42:03,229 --> 00:42:04,062
And you know what?

835
00:42:04,064 --> 00:42:05,229
It's rude.

836
00:42:05,231 --> 00:42:07,065
It's rude never
talking to his family.

837
00:42:07,067 --> 00:42:09,736
[ominous music]

838
00:42:24,751 --> 00:42:27,554
No, he's taking
this all really hard.

839
00:42:27,588 --> 00:42:29,220
He's getting weirder.

840
00:42:29,222 --> 00:42:30,689
[Emily] Okay, this
has been really hard

841
00:42:30,691 --> 00:42:33,026
for all of us today.

842
00:42:33,059 --> 00:42:35,059
Please don't be mean to him.

843
00:42:35,061 --> 00:42:36,461
He's not even in
his body anymore.

844
00:42:36,463 --> 00:42:39,598
It's like there's nothing there.

845
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:40,599
I mean, did you see
him at the funeral?

846
00:42:40,601 --> 00:42:43,069
Alexa please, just stop.

847
00:42:43,103 --> 00:42:46,104
[soft music]

848
00:42:46,106 --> 00:42:48,206
I'm gonna go to bed.

849
00:42:48,208 --> 00:42:49,140
Me too.

850
00:42:49,142 --> 00:42:50,577
Maybe it's warmer up there.

851
00:42:50,611 --> 00:42:54,613
[Randy] I'll join
you guys in a minute.

852
00:42:54,615 --> 00:42:55,916
Dad.

853
00:42:55,949 --> 00:42:58,284
[soft music]

854
00:43:09,963 --> 00:43:11,162
I'll hit the
lights and join you.

855
00:43:11,164 --> 00:43:13,297
We can all use the
goodnight sleep.

856
00:43:13,299 --> 00:43:15,669
[soft music]

857
00:43:22,142 --> 00:43:25,111
Stephen, you must be freezing.

858
00:43:25,145 --> 00:43:27,779
Michelle, pass me your blanket.

859
00:43:27,781 --> 00:43:29,783
I'm not cold.

860
00:43:29,816 --> 00:43:30,749
What do you mean
you're not cold?

861
00:43:30,751 --> 00:43:32,751
It's freezing in here.

862
00:43:32,753 --> 00:43:34,653
Maybe if you wore more clothes

863
00:43:34,655 --> 00:43:37,758
and stopped dressing like a
whore, you wouldn't be so cold.

864
00:43:37,791 --> 00:43:39,323
Hey.

865
00:43:39,325 --> 00:43:42,328
Don't talk to your
sister like that.

866
00:43:43,697 --> 00:43:46,933
Well maybe if I were a
little more liquored up, Mom,

867
00:43:46,967 --> 00:43:48,301
I could ignore what was right

868
00:43:48,334 --> 00:43:51,202
fucking in front of
me this whole time.

869
00:43:51,204 --> 00:43:55,542
You do not talk to
your mother like that.

870
00:43:55,609 --> 00:43:56,610
I'm sorry.

871
00:43:58,511 --> 00:44:02,180
I just wanted to make
sure I wasn't being rude.

872
00:44:02,182 --> 00:44:05,185
[suspenseful music]

873
00:44:19,666 --> 00:44:20,799
He's hurting.

874
00:44:20,801 --> 00:44:22,468
You can't blame him.

875
00:44:29,375 --> 00:44:30,711
What was that?

876
00:44:31,878 --> 00:44:33,747
Let's just go to bed.

877
00:44:35,682 --> 00:44:38,384
[dramatic music]

878
00:44:48,561 --> 00:44:50,394
[Woman] Joseph.

879
00:44:50,396 --> 00:44:53,166
[dramatic music]

880
00:44:54,500 --> 00:44:56,167
Who's there?

881
00:44:56,169 --> 00:44:58,872
[dramatic music]

882
00:45:08,882 --> 00:45:10,550
Turn your music down, Stephen.

883
00:45:10,583 --> 00:45:12,183
We're trying to sleep.

884
00:45:12,185 --> 00:45:15,021
[energetic music]

885
00:45:26,933 --> 00:45:29,233
It just got really
quiet in here.

886
00:45:29,235 --> 00:45:30,869
[Alexa] What?

887
00:45:30,871 --> 00:45:33,874
Whatever, let's
just go back to bed.

888
00:45:35,441 --> 00:45:36,810
It's too quiet.

889
00:45:39,112 --> 00:45:40,480
[Woman] Joseph.

890
00:45:42,816 --> 00:45:44,150
Stephen?

891
00:45:44,217 --> 00:45:45,585
[Woman] Joseph.

892
00:45:52,292 --> 00:45:53,126
No, no.

893
00:45:55,461 --> 00:45:57,796
I'm here, Joseph.

894
00:45:57,798 --> 00:46:00,266
[eerie music]

895
00:46:09,575 --> 00:46:11,077
[Randy] You feeling all right?

896
00:46:11,111 --> 00:46:11,943
[Stephen] Yeah, I'm fine.

897
00:46:11,945 --> 00:46:13,444
Okay.

898
00:46:13,446 --> 00:46:15,980
So what was all that noise
last night in your room?

899
00:46:15,982 --> 00:46:17,183
What's that about?

900
00:46:17,250 --> 00:46:18,482
[Stephen] I wasn't
making any noise.

901
00:46:18,484 --> 00:46:20,484
It sounded like an
earthquake, Stephen.

902
00:46:20,486 --> 00:46:23,356
[Stephen] I didn't
hear anything.

903
00:46:24,657 --> 00:46:26,991
Look, your mother's
still really shaken up.

904
00:46:26,993 --> 00:46:29,293
I need you to keep
it down today, okay.

905
00:46:29,295 --> 00:46:30,130
Please.

906
00:46:32,833 --> 00:46:35,668
I found my dad's bow
and arrows in the shed.

907
00:46:35,702 --> 00:46:36,870
Taking them out.

908
00:46:36,937 --> 00:46:38,036
I don't think
that's a good idea.

909
00:46:38,038 --> 00:46:39,372
I second that.

910
00:46:44,310 --> 00:46:45,645
I'm going out.

911
00:46:47,781 --> 00:46:51,515
The house is warming up so
I'm gonna go take a shower.

912
00:46:51,517 --> 00:46:52,719
Yeah.

913
00:46:52,786 --> 00:46:55,854
You know whatever was
wrong with the furnace,

914
00:46:55,856 --> 00:46:58,022
it's definitely fixed itself.

915
00:46:58,024 --> 00:47:00,626
[ominous music]

916
00:48:19,772 --> 00:48:21,305
[Man] And drop.

00:48:21,307 --> 00:48:23,743
[soft music]

918
00:48:28,281 --> 00:48:29,247
Skip.

919
00:48:29,249 --> 00:48:31,651
[soft music]

920
00:48:42,795 --> 00:48:43,763
Let it fly.

921
00:48:43,796 --> 00:48:46,166
[soft music]

922
00:48:47,500 --> 00:48:48,401
Daddy?

923
00:48:48,434 --> 00:48:50,803
[soft music]

924
00:49:06,920 --> 00:49:09,489
Stephen, where have you been?

925
00:49:10,957 --> 00:49:12,325
I went hunting.

926
00:49:14,594 --> 00:49:16,496
What happened to you?

927
00:49:22,969 --> 00:49:26,104
Randy's made a
beautiful dinner.

928
00:49:26,106 --> 00:49:28,975
Why don't you go
and wash up, okay?

929
00:49:31,277 --> 00:49:32,645
I'm not hungry.

930
00:49:35,115 --> 00:49:36,149
Take the salad to the table.

931
00:49:36,182 --> 00:49:37,448
Okay.

932
00:49:37,450 --> 00:49:40,786
I don't know how to
talk to him, Michelle.

933
00:49:40,820 --> 00:49:42,322
I'm trying, mom.

934
00:49:43,356 --> 00:49:44,790
I'm here for him.

935
00:49:45,992 --> 00:49:46,891
I know you are.

936
00:49:46,893 --> 00:49:48,359
Come here.

937
00:49:48,361 --> 00:49:49,195
Thank you.

938
00:49:58,638 --> 00:50:01,207
[wind howling]

939
00:50:04,177 --> 00:50:05,643
[Alexa] Is it just me

940
00:50:05,645 --> 00:50:07,645
or are things getting
really weird around here?

941
00:50:07,647 --> 00:50:09,315
What do you mean?

942
00:50:09,349 --> 00:50:10,881
Really, Michelle?

943
00:50:10,883 --> 00:50:13,019
Your grandma kills herself
in front of everyone

944
00:50:13,053 --> 00:50:15,053
and now Stephen with
all this freaky shit.

945
00:50:15,055 --> 00:50:17,090
What do you think I mean?

946
00:50:18,925 --> 00:50:21,027
Okay, I'm sorry.

947
00:50:21,061 --> 00:50:21,892
I didn't mean to
sound like that.

948
00:50:21,894 --> 00:50:23,827
No, you did.

949
00:50:23,829 --> 00:50:25,663
But it's true.

950
00:50:25,665 --> 00:50:27,367
Things are not right.

951
00:50:27,400 --> 00:50:31,235
Weird as you say and
I don't know why.

952
00:50:31,237 --> 00:50:33,739
I was taking a shower earlier.

953
00:50:35,408 --> 00:50:36,242
And?

954
00:50:37,743 --> 00:50:39,545
I sensed a presence.

955
00:50:41,281 --> 00:50:42,548
Presence?

956
00:50:42,582 --> 00:50:44,282
I felt a presence
and when I turned,

957
00:50:44,284 --> 00:50:46,052
there was writing in the mirror.

958
00:50:46,086 --> 00:50:49,853
Words like someone had traced
them in the condensation.

959
00:50:49,855 --> 00:50:51,124
What the hell?

960
00:50:52,092 --> 00:50:53,726
What were the words?

961
00:50:55,361 --> 00:50:56,562
Help Stephen.

962
00:50:57,697 --> 00:50:59,399
It said help Stephen.

963
00:51:01,267 --> 00:51:06,272
[eerie music]
[children screaming]

964
00:51:09,976 --> 00:51:13,444
[door creaking]

965
00:51:13,446 --> 00:51:15,948
[eerie music]

966
00:51:31,231 --> 00:51:32,997
Relax, Stephen.

967
00:51:32,999 --> 00:51:35,466
Get away from that boy.

968
00:51:35,468 --> 00:51:37,737
Don't you touch him.

969
00:51:37,770 --> 00:51:39,737
You didn't see this.

970
00:51:39,739 --> 00:51:41,672
I didn't want to.

971
00:51:41,674 --> 00:51:44,744
[suspenseful music]

972
00:51:44,777 --> 00:51:46,144
Evil prick.

973
00:51:46,146 --> 00:51:49,115
[suspenseful music]

974
00:52:14,307 --> 00:52:15,139
What the hell is going on?

975
00:52:15,141 --> 00:52:15,973
I don't know.

976
00:52:15,975 --> 00:52:17,810
It's Stephen's room.

977
00:52:21,047 --> 00:52:24,150
[children screaming]

978
00:52:31,023 --> 00:52:33,826
Furnace must have
stopped working again.

979
00:52:33,859 --> 00:52:35,061
It's so cold.

980
00:52:47,907 --> 00:52:49,809
[Stephen] Liars burn.

981
00:52:51,311 --> 00:52:52,078
Stephen.

982
00:52:54,647 --> 00:52:58,017
Oh my god, what have
you done to yourself?

983
00:52:58,050 --> 00:52:58,851
Oh Jesus.

984
00:53:00,853 --> 00:53:04,555
[speaking in foreign language]

985
00:53:04,557 --> 00:53:05,925
What's he saying?

986
00:53:10,363 --> 00:53:11,564
DuMal led me.

987
00:53:14,066 --> 00:53:14,900
DuMal.

988
00:53:15,935 --> 00:53:16,736
Led me.

989
00:53:19,572 --> 00:53:20,906
Led you where?

990
00:53:22,408 --> 00:53:23,243
Malo.

991
00:53:24,777 --> 00:53:25,611
Malo.

992
00:53:27,079 --> 00:53:28,114
Who's evil?

993
00:53:32,017 --> 00:53:33,184
Killers.

994
00:53:33,186 --> 00:53:38,191
[hand pounding]
[eerie music]

995
00:53:44,096 --> 00:53:46,599
[eerie music]

996
00:53:53,606 --> 00:53:54,607
He loved us.

997
00:53:57,710 --> 00:53:59,545
And they want his soul.

998
00:53:59,579 --> 00:54:01,914
[soft music]

999
00:54:07,787 --> 00:54:08,621
Daddy.

1000
00:54:10,290 --> 00:54:11,157
Who baby?

1001
00:54:12,758 --> 00:54:14,260
It's the church.

1002
00:54:16,429 --> 00:54:17,930
It's the goddamn church.

1003
00:54:17,963 --> 00:54:19,297
No.

1004
00:54:19,299 --> 00:54:22,168
[kettle whistling]

1005
00:54:31,811 --> 00:54:32,643
Oh my god.

1006
00:54:32,645 --> 00:54:33,477
Let me take a look.

1007
00:54:33,479 --> 00:54:34,312
What happened?

1008
00:54:34,314 --> 00:54:35,145
I'm fine.

1009
00:54:35,147 --> 00:54:36,416
I'm okay.

1010
00:54:36,449 --> 00:54:38,081
I had to restrain him so
he didn't hurt himself.

1011
00:54:38,083 --> 00:54:39,585
What?

1012
00:54:39,619 --> 00:54:41,452
I didn't realize
he was so strong.

1013
00:54:41,454 --> 00:54:44,622
We should call
Monsignor Canell.

1014
00:54:44,624 --> 00:54:47,825
Why would we call
Monsignor Canell?

1015
00:54:47,827 --> 00:54:48,994
He can help.

1016
00:54:51,331 --> 00:54:53,531
Michelle, you
gotta get serious.

1017
00:54:53,533 --> 00:54:55,100
Stephen is crazy.

1018
00:54:55,134 --> 00:54:56,334
Your brother is crazy.

1019
00:54:56,336 --> 00:54:58,304
No amount of religion
can sugarcoat that.

1020
00:54:58,338 --> 00:54:59,337
How do you explain
the knife, dad?

1021
00:54:59,339 --> 00:55:00,973
We all saw it fly into his hand.

1022
00:55:01,006 --> 00:55:05,042
We need to work out
what we're going to do.

1023
00:55:05,044 --> 00:55:06,446
I'm gonna call the doctor

1024
00:55:06,479 --> 00:55:09,347
and I'm gonna get him sedated.

1025
00:55:09,349 --> 00:55:11,351
He needs our help not drugs.

1026
00:55:11,384 --> 00:55:12,216
You heard what he said.

1027
00:55:12,218 --> 00:55:13,050
Help me.

1028
00:55:13,052 --> 00:55:14,320
I am gonna help him.

1029
00:55:14,354 --> 00:55:16,854
I'm gonna get him
sedated, Michelle.

1030
00:55:16,856 --> 00:55:17,990
Do you think the part
of Stephen's problem

1031
00:55:18,023 --> 00:55:19,223
is that you are so hard on him?

1032
00:55:19,225 --> 00:55:22,462
Michelle, I've
tried my hardest,

1033
00:55:22,495 --> 00:55:23,961
but nothing that
I might have done

1034
00:55:23,963 --> 00:55:27,298
could have turned him into
that thing that was up there.

1035
00:55:27,300 --> 00:55:29,335
My brother was fine
and perfectly happy

1036
00:55:29,369 --> 00:55:30,401
when we had our real dad.

1037
00:55:30,403 --> 00:55:31,471
And how long ago was that?

1038
00:55:31,504 --> 00:55:32,403
Michelle, wait.

1039
00:55:32,405 --> 00:55:33,506
You can't pin this on my dad.

1040
00:55:33,539 --> 00:55:34,372
Michelle.

1041
00:55:34,374 --> 00:55:35,539
God.

1042
00:55:35,541 --> 00:55:37,040
[soft music]

1043
00:55:37,042 --> 00:55:38,041
She did not mean that.

1044
00:55:38,043 --> 00:55:39,379
Yeah, she did.

1045
00:55:41,881 --> 00:55:42,715
It's true.

1046
00:55:44,016 --> 00:55:46,550
Baby, I am not the problem here.

1047
00:55:46,552 --> 00:55:48,386
I know you're not the problem.

1048
00:55:48,388 --> 00:55:49,221
He is.

1049
00:55:50,990 --> 00:55:54,360
And when I say he, I
do not mean Stephen.

1050
00:55:54,394 --> 00:55:55,595
I mean his dad.

1051
00:55:58,230 --> 00:56:01,434
His abandonment has
taken away all the good

1052
00:56:01,501 --> 00:56:03,736
that was in that little boy

1053
00:56:04,870 --> 00:56:07,070
and it's left a
gaping hole of despair

1054
00:56:07,072 --> 00:56:09,742
and I can't handle it anymore.

1055
00:56:09,775 --> 00:56:12,177
[soft music]

1056
00:56:16,048 --> 00:56:17,014
[Father DuMal]
Saint Michael's.

1057
00:56:17,016 --> 00:56:18,916
Monsignor Canell?

1058
00:56:18,918 --> 00:56:20,286
[Father DuMal] Michelle?

1059
00:56:20,353 --> 00:56:21,519
Yes.

1060
00:56:21,521 --> 00:56:22,688
[Father DuMal]
This is Father DuMal.

1061
00:56:22,722 --> 00:56:24,187
Father, I need to
speak to the Monsignor.

1062
00:56:24,189 --> 00:56:25,589
Something's terribly
wrong with Stephen.

1063
00:56:25,591 --> 00:56:27,927
He was screaming terrible
things last night about killing

1064
00:56:27,960 --> 00:56:29,862
and he said something
about you, Father.

1065
00:56:29,895 --> 00:56:32,129
About that you led him.

1066
00:56:32,131 --> 00:56:33,466
Led him where?

1067
00:56:34,300 --> 00:56:35,568
I don't know.

1068
00:56:35,601 --> 00:56:37,568
He was yelling about
the church and you.

1069
00:56:37,570 --> 00:56:39,405
Not really you.

1070
00:56:39,439 --> 00:56:40,272
Just our.

1071
00:56:42,241 --> 00:56:45,709
[Father DuMal]
Your who, Michelle?

1072
00:56:45,711 --> 00:56:46,546
Our dad.

1073
00:56:48,781 --> 00:56:50,816
Listen Michelle, your
family's going through

1074
00:56:50,883 --> 00:56:52,616
a very traumatic time right now

1075
00:56:52,618 --> 00:56:56,286
and none of you are
thinking clearly.

1076
00:56:56,288 --> 00:56:58,758
Please let me speak
to Monsignor Canell.

1077
00:56:58,791 --> 00:57:00,558
I'm sorry but Monsignor
is busy right now

1078
00:57:00,560 --> 00:57:01,761
and he can't take the call,

1079
00:57:01,794 --> 00:57:04,628
but I will pass the
message onto him.

1080
00:57:04,630 --> 00:57:05,465
Okay?

1081
00:57:06,332 --> 00:57:07,631
Okay.

1082
00:57:07,633 --> 00:57:10,169
Thank you for
calling and God bless.

1083
00:57:10,235 --> 00:57:11,904
Thank you, Father.

1084
00:57:12,805 --> 00:57:14,438
What's wrong?

1085
00:57:14,440 --> 00:57:17,109
I'm not sure but something is.

1086
00:57:20,813 --> 00:57:22,145
[Stephen] We want his soul.

1087
00:57:22,147 --> 00:57:24,817
[ominous music]

1088
00:57:41,867 --> 00:57:42,702
Well?

1089
00:57:43,936 --> 00:57:45,769
Well, he doesn't
have a temperature

1090
00:57:45,771 --> 00:57:47,337
and his vital signs are normal,

1091
00:57:47,339 --> 00:57:49,809
but what's abnormal
is for someone

1092
00:57:49,842 --> 00:57:52,512
to move continuously for so long

1093
00:57:53,679 --> 00:57:57,216
with no respiratory or
heart rate increase.

1094
00:57:58,217 --> 00:57:59,785
It's not his body.

1095
00:57:59,819 --> 00:58:02,488
Whatever is wrong
is in his mind.

1096
00:58:05,157 --> 00:58:06,892
So, what can we do?

1097
00:58:08,193 --> 00:58:10,863
I gave him a sedative
so he'll stay calm

1098
00:58:10,896 --> 00:58:13,063
until you head back tomorrow.

1099
00:58:13,065 --> 00:58:15,533
Any change, call me.

1100
00:58:15,535 --> 00:58:16,469
Thank you.

1101
00:58:16,502 --> 00:58:18,871
No, I haven't done anything.

1102
00:58:19,872 --> 00:58:22,074
You're the help he needs.

1103
00:58:22,141 --> 00:58:25,010
[thunder rumbling]

1104
00:58:25,044 --> 00:58:26,343
Appreciate it.

1105
00:58:26,345 --> 00:58:28,013
We should get going.

1106
00:58:29,048 --> 00:58:31,081
Did you call Monsignor again?

1107
00:58:31,083 --> 00:58:34,019
I'm waiting for
him to call back.

1108
00:58:36,522 --> 00:58:38,691
I'm sorry about what
I said to your dad.

1109
00:58:38,724 --> 00:58:41,091
No, no, it's fine.

1110
00:58:41,093 --> 00:58:43,929
I know sometimes
he can be a jerk.

1111
00:58:45,397 --> 00:58:48,400
Alexa, I know
Stephen's not crazy.

1112
00:58:49,769 --> 00:58:51,769
I think he's possessed.

1113
00:58:51,771 --> 00:58:52,603
Shut up.

1114
00:58:52,605 --> 00:58:53,437
You're scaring me.

1115
00:58:53,439 --> 00:58:54,707
I'm scared, too.

1116
00:58:54,740 --> 00:58:56,373
That's why we need
Monsignor Canell.

1117
00:58:56,375 --> 00:58:57,209
Well call him, Michelle.

1118
00:58:57,242 --> 00:58:58,778
Call him right now.

1119
00:59:01,881 --> 00:59:05,082
[phone ringing]

1120
00:59:05,084 --> 00:59:06,085
[Monsignor Canell]
This is Monsignor.

1121
00:59:06,118 --> 00:59:07,286
I've got him.

1122
00:59:07,352 --> 00:59:08,554
[Monsignor Canell]
This opportunity

1123
00:59:08,588 --> 00:59:10,420
to share Christ with you
and with your family.

1124
00:59:10,422 --> 00:59:13,056
Please leave your name and
number and I'll call you back.

1125
00:59:13,058 --> 00:59:15,859
Monsignor, this
message is for you.

1126
00:59:15,861 --> 00:59:17,429
It's Michelle Tade.

1127
00:59:18,430 --> 00:59:20,265
We really need you.

1128
00:59:20,299 --> 00:59:21,901
I know we already
called Father DuMal

1129
00:59:21,934 --> 00:59:26,539
and he said you were busy,
but we really need you here.

1130
00:59:28,140 --> 00:59:28,974
Hello.

1131
00:59:29,942 --> 00:59:30,774
Hello.

1132
00:59:30,776 --> 00:59:33,779
[dial tone humming]

1133
00:59:35,581 --> 00:59:38,250
[ominous music]

1134
00:59:46,659 --> 00:59:48,959
[Boy] Can't you
just let him go?

1135
00:59:48,961 --> 00:59:49,793
[Man] Hey Stephen,
can you help me?

1136
00:59:49,795 --> 00:59:52,498
[Boy] Please, please.

1137
00:59:52,565 --> 00:59:55,165
[Man] Please help me.

1138
00:59:55,167 --> 00:59:57,269
Release my soul.

1139
00:59:57,302 --> 01:00:02,307
[ominous music]
[floor thumping]

1140
01:00:04,744 --> 01:00:07,246
He never did anything wrong.

1141
01:00:08,948 --> 01:00:09,982
Oh sweetie.

1142
01:00:10,983 --> 01:00:12,518
Neither of you did.

1143
01:00:13,819 --> 01:00:14,985
Okay?

1144
01:00:14,987 --> 01:00:16,353
[eerie music]

1145
01:00:16,355 --> 01:00:17,354
[floor thumping]

1146
01:00:17,356 --> 01:00:19,156
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1147
01:00:19,158 --> 01:00:19,992
Baby.

1148
01:00:20,993 --> 01:00:21,825
Calm down.

1149
01:00:21,827 --> 01:00:22,660
He's sedated.

1150
01:00:22,662 --> 01:00:23,493
[Alexa] How?

1151
01:00:23,495 --> 01:00:24,762
Get busy.

1152
01:00:24,764 --> 01:00:25,663
Go pack.

1153
01:00:25,665 --> 01:00:27,299
I know you haven't packed yet.

1154
01:00:27,332 --> 01:00:28,165
We're out of here tomorrow.

1155
01:00:28,167 --> 01:00:29,001
Really?

1156
01:00:30,302 --> 01:00:31,136
Really.

1157
01:00:32,504 --> 01:00:33,539
Called the doctor to come
back tomorrow morning

1158
01:00:33,606 --> 01:00:36,607
to give him a shot just in case,

1159
01:00:36,609 --> 01:00:38,811
so we can get him home safely.

1160
01:00:38,844 --> 01:00:40,646
Get him to a hospital.

1161
01:00:43,849 --> 01:00:45,348
I'm really worried.

1162
01:00:45,350 --> 01:00:46,151
I know.

1163
01:00:47,152 --> 01:00:47,985
We all are.

1164
01:00:47,987 --> 01:00:48,819
Come here.

1165
01:00:48,821 --> 01:00:49,622
Come here.

1166
01:00:50,790 --> 01:00:52,324
I know.

1167
01:00:52,357 --> 01:00:53,356
I know.

1168
01:00:53,358 --> 01:00:55,728
[soft music]

1169
01:00:59,164 --> 01:01:00,833
What did he say?

1170
01:01:00,866 --> 01:01:02,365
Who?

1171
01:01:02,367 --> 01:01:03,202
Stephen.

1172
01:01:04,704 --> 01:01:07,072
I guess in Latin in his room.

1173
01:01:09,008 --> 01:01:12,209
Do not lead me
into temptation.

1174
01:01:12,211 --> 01:01:13,646
What did he mean?

1175
01:01:13,679 --> 01:01:15,512
[Michelle] I don't know.

1176
01:01:15,514 --> 01:01:18,649
He said Father DuMal led me.

1177
01:01:18,651 --> 01:01:19,883
I know.

1178
01:01:19,885 --> 01:01:22,221
Led him where, Michelle?

1179
01:01:22,254 --> 01:01:24,888
[soft music]

1180
01:01:24,890 --> 01:01:27,259
He said he led him to malo.

1181
01:01:28,260 --> 01:01:29,226
To evil.

1182
01:01:29,228 --> 01:01:31,764
[wind howling]

1183
01:01:37,502 --> 01:01:38,501
You came.

1184
01:01:38,503 --> 01:01:40,172
Thank God, you came.

1185
01:01:40,205 --> 01:01:41,540
Of course we did.

1186
01:01:41,573 --> 01:01:43,707
I'm so happy to see you.

1187
01:01:43,709 --> 01:01:45,709
Father DuMal wouldn't let
me speak to the Monsignor

1188
01:01:45,711 --> 01:01:47,678
and Stephen's been
screaming terrible things

1189
01:01:47,680 --> 01:01:49,446
about Father DuMal about
him taking him places

1190
01:01:49,448 --> 01:01:50,449
and making him do things...

1191
01:01:50,515 --> 01:01:52,017
Calm down, child.

1192
01:01:53,753 --> 01:01:56,188
Why don't you let us in?

1193
01:01:56,221 --> 01:01:57,256
I'm coming.

1194
01:02:00,059 --> 01:02:00,793
Monsignor.

1195
01:02:01,961 --> 01:02:03,796
Monsignor had
prior commitments,

1196
01:02:03,863 --> 01:02:07,199
but I can sure you
he is very concerned.

1197
01:02:08,567 --> 01:02:10,736
Your brother has been putting
these malicious thoughts

1198
01:02:10,770 --> 01:02:12,269
into your head, Michelle.

1199
01:02:12,271 --> 01:02:14,774
[eerie music]

1200
01:02:15,941 --> 01:02:18,143
I understand that
you have questions.

1201
01:02:18,210 --> 01:02:20,079
Why don't you come
take a walk with us?

1202
01:02:20,112 --> 01:02:22,946
And we can discuss everything
that's been going on.

1203
01:02:22,948 --> 01:02:24,149
We could use you to
help us to find a way

1204
01:02:24,216 --> 01:02:25,584
to best help your brother.

1205
01:02:25,617 --> 01:02:26,449
[Sister Clare] Father.

1206
01:02:26,451 --> 01:02:27,286
What?

1207
01:02:28,921 --> 01:02:29,787
Nothing.

1208
01:02:29,789 --> 01:02:32,291
[soft music]

1209
01:02:32,324 --> 01:02:34,658
Come on, Michelle.

1210
01:02:34,660 --> 01:02:37,096
[soft music]

1211
01:02:52,077 --> 01:02:54,845

[ominous music]

1213
01:03:03,823 --> 01:03:04,957
Stop.

1214
01:03:04,990 --> 01:03:05,823
I won't go with you.

1215
01:03:05,825 --> 01:03:06,757
I'm not my brother.

1216
01:03:06,759 --> 01:03:07,960
No, you're more dangerous.

1217
01:03:07,993 --> 01:03:09,827
You don't have to do this.

1218
01:03:09,829 --> 01:03:10,660
Tell the truth.

1219
01:03:10,662 --> 01:03:11,530
It will all end.

1220
01:03:11,596 --> 01:03:12,495
What truth?

1221
01:03:12,497 --> 01:03:13,699
What did you do to Stephen?

1222
01:03:13,766 --> 01:03:15,165
Where did you take my brother?

1223
01:03:15,167 --> 01:03:17,369
I took him to hell
exactly where I was taken.

1224
01:03:17,436 --> 01:03:19,972
Where Joseph took
all those poor boys.

1225
01:03:20,005 --> 01:03:20,838
Joseph was...

1226
01:03:20,840 --> 01:03:21,671
Shut up.

1227
01:03:21,673 --> 01:03:23,540
No, I won't.

1228
01:03:23,542 --> 01:03:24,944
He's dead.

1229
01:03:24,977 --> 01:03:27,044
You don't have to
protect the past anymore.

1230
01:03:27,046 --> 01:03:27,878
I'm taking her back.

1231
01:03:27,880 --> 01:03:29,281
No, you're not.

1232
01:03:29,314 --> 01:03:32,317
[suspenseful music]

1233
01:03:35,721 --> 01:03:37,289
[Michelle] Stephen.

1234
01:03:37,322 --> 01:03:39,456
He won't let you do this.

1235
01:03:39,458 --> 01:03:40,292
Stephen.

1236
01:03:41,460 --> 01:03:42,625
Oh God.

1237
01:03:42,627 --> 01:03:44,795
[ominous music]

1238
01:03:44,797 --> 01:03:45,630
Stephen?

1239
01:03:46,866 --> 01:03:49,168
Randy, Stephen's missing.

1240
01:03:49,201 --> 01:03:51,368
[ominous music]

1241
01:03:51,370 --> 01:03:53,370
Please Stephen.

1242
01:03:53,372 --> 01:03:54,204
Don't go.

1243
01:03:54,206 --> 01:03:55,875
Leave him alone, Father.

1244
01:03:55,908 --> 01:03:57,409
Don't go, Stephen.

1245
01:04:00,579 --> 01:04:02,045
Please help me.

1246
01:04:02,047 --> 01:04:04,716
[ominous music]

1247
01:04:06,351 --> 01:04:07,519
Why?

1248
01:04:07,552 --> 01:04:08,387
Why?

1249
01:04:09,388 --> 01:04:10,222
Stephen.

1250
01:04:11,056 --> 01:04:12,389
[Boy] Come on, grandfather.

1251
01:04:12,391 --> 01:04:13,558
Go on.

1252
01:04:13,592 --> 01:04:14,724
Tell him that you'll
take care of me.

1253
01:04:14,726 --> 01:04:15,560
I see.

1254
01:04:15,594 --> 01:04:16,426
I see.

1255
01:04:16,428 --> 01:04:17,260
I forgive you.

1256
01:04:17,262 --> 01:04:20,097
[ominous music]

1257
01:04:20,099 --> 01:04:23,066
[Father DuMal] You
can't forgive me.

1258
01:04:23,068 --> 01:04:24,036
No.

1259
01:04:24,069 --> 01:04:27,072
[suspenseful music]

1260
01:04:41,020 --> 01:04:41,852
[Emily] Michelle.

1261
01:04:41,854 --> 01:04:42,853
Michelle.

1262
01:04:42,855 --> 01:04:44,356
Michelle.

1263
01:04:44,389 --> 01:04:45,224
This is not acceptable.

1264
01:04:45,257 --> 01:04:47,424
This is not acceptable.

1265
01:04:47,426 --> 01:04:48,293
Not at all.

1266
01:04:50,695 --> 01:04:53,899
You do not do this
to the family.

1267
01:04:53,933 --> 01:04:54,766
Enough.

1268
01:04:56,268 --> 01:04:57,102
Enough.

1269
01:05:03,042 --> 01:05:05,210
I can't take this anymore.

1270

[wind howling]
[heartbeat pounding]

1271
01:05:19,925 --> 01:05:21,293
Someone's here.

1272
01:05:22,661 --> 01:05:23,896
Who?

01:05:23,929 --> 01:05:25,095
[thunder rumbling]

1274
01:05:25,097 --> 01:05:26,165
Don't know.

1277
01:05:41,246 --> 01:05:42,915
I want to see the boy.

1278
01:05:42,948 --> 01:05:44,449
You're too late.

1279
01:05:47,452 --> 01:05:49,688
Monsignor, he has killed.

1280
01:05:53,658 --> 01:05:55,660
I want to see the boy.

1281
01:05:57,129 --> 01:05:59,296
All right, I'll stay
here with the girl.

1282
01:05:59,298 --> 01:06:00,964
You will stay with me.

[ominous music]

1284
01:06:19,151 --> 01:06:20,485
Give me a cloth.

1287
01:06:34,333 --> 01:06:36,333
You stay with them.

1289

Stephen.

1291
01:07:14,206 --> 01:07:15,372
It's Monsignor Canell.

I'm here to help you.

1294
01:07:21,413 --> 01:07:24,116
[demon growling]

1295
01:07:25,550 --> 01:07:27,951
You touched those boys.

1296
01:07:27,953 --> 01:07:30,189
You let him touch him, too.

1297
01:07:31,423 --> 01:07:33,590
Did you masturbate
when you watched?

1298
01:07:33,592 --> 01:07:36,461
[thunder rumbling]

1299
01:07:38,797 --> 01:07:40,465
Where's grandfather?

1300
01:07:40,532 --> 01:07:42,765
[thunder rumbling]

1301
01:07:42,767 --> 01:07:44,869
[speaking in foreign language]

1302
01:07:44,903 --> 01:07:47,072
Joseph, they are children.

1303
01:07:49,741 --> 01:07:50,707
Don't kill the father.

1304
01:07:50,709 --> 01:07:51,943
Kill the prick.

1305
01:07:52,811 --> 01:07:55,145
[thunder rumbling]

1306
01:07:55,147 --> 01:07:57,049
Don't touch me there, Father.

1307
01:07:57,082 --> 01:07:57,916
It hurts.

1308
01:07:59,784 --> 01:08:01,053
If he speaks the truth...

1309
01:08:01,086 --> 01:08:02,719
He doesn't.

1310
01:08:02,721 --> 01:08:04,154
They're lies.

1311
01:08:04,156 --> 01:08:04,988
He's the devil.

1312
01:08:04,990 --> 01:08:06,992
The demon spewing fifth.

1313
01:08:08,160 --> 01:08:10,229
He's trying to turn
our faith against us.

1314
01:08:10,262 --> 01:08:11,761
[Rosemary] Joseph, I swore

1315
01:08:11,763 --> 01:08:14,564
on the Bible I would never tell.

1316
01:08:14,566 --> 01:08:16,135
My soul is burning.

1317
01:08:19,471 --> 01:08:20,839
[Child] Please.

1318
01:08:21,806 --> 01:08:22,939
Keep him from me.

1319
01:08:22,941 --> 01:08:24,443
I want to go home.

1320
01:08:27,012 --> 01:08:30,313
How many more must
die 'cause they know?

1321
01:08:30,315 --> 01:08:32,817
'Cause you can't shut them up.

1322
01:08:33,818 --> 01:08:34,984
Killer.

1323
01:08:34,986 --> 01:08:37,789
[child screaming]

1324
01:08:37,822 --> 01:08:38,755
Let me go.

1325
01:08:38,757 --> 01:08:39,624
I have to see him.

1326
01:08:39,658 --> 01:08:41,458
He's still my child.

1327
01:08:41,460 --> 01:08:46,465
[ominous music]
[boys crying]

1328
01:08:52,437 --> 01:08:55,140
[demon growling]

1329
01:08:59,644 --> 01:09:01,813
I command you through
the blood of Christ,

1330
01:09:01,846 --> 01:09:04,514
release Stephen Tade's soul.

1331
01:09:04,516 --> 01:09:06,015
God.

1332
01:09:06,017 --> 01:09:10,055
I command you in the name
and power of the holy spirit.

1333
01:09:10,989 --> 01:09:13,692
[demon growling]

1334
01:09:17,162 --> 01:09:20,499
Father DuMal, where
are you taking me?

1335
01:09:22,067 --> 01:09:24,734
Where did you take Stephen?

1336
01:09:24,736 --> 01:09:25,904
To molest him?

1337
01:09:26,805 --> 01:09:29,139
What is he talking about?

1338
01:09:29,141 --> 01:09:33,376
Hey grandfather, you said
it was for God but it wasn't.

1339
01:09:33,378 --> 01:09:35,378
It was for your
shriveled old prick.

1340
01:09:35,380 --> 01:09:36,213
Tell them.

1341
01:09:36,215 --> 01:09:38,083
Who is he talking to?

1342
01:09:39,218 --> 01:09:40,583
Forgive those who trespass.

1343
01:09:40,585 --> 01:09:42,987
[soft music]

1344
01:09:44,889 --> 01:09:48,358
His grandfather, the molester.

1345
01:09:48,360 --> 01:09:49,194
What?

1346
01:09:50,895 --> 01:09:52,729
The killer.

1347
01:09:52,731 --> 01:09:54,164
Tell 'em, grandfather.

1348
01:09:54,166 --> 01:09:55,498
Tell 'em.

1349
01:09:55,500 --> 01:09:57,169
How you took care of me.

1350
01:09:57,202 --> 01:09:59,736
How you took care of all of us.

1351
01:09:59,738 --> 01:10:01,440
Stephen, Stephen.

1352
01:10:01,506 --> 01:10:04,274
Baby, you need to listen to me.

1353
01:10:04,276 --> 01:10:07,577
Your grandfather
died a month ago.

1354
01:10:07,579 --> 01:10:09,013
[Rosemary] He
couldn't leave you.

1355
01:10:09,047 --> 01:10:11,716
[ominous music]

1356
01:10:12,584 --> 01:10:15,254
No door would open for his soul.

1357
01:10:16,455 --> 01:10:19,422
Your mother speaks
the truth, Stephen.

1358
01:10:19,424 --> 01:10:21,560
We buried him
under the oak tree.

1359
01:10:21,593 --> 01:10:23,393
I closed his casket.

1360
01:10:23,395 --> 01:10:25,728
I commended him to the earth.

1361
01:10:25,730 --> 01:10:27,197
You were there.

1362
01:10:27,199 --> 01:10:28,567
That's right.

1363
01:10:28,600 --> 01:10:31,801
He's there begging
for a blowjob.

1364
01:10:31,803 --> 01:10:34,306
[eerie music]

1365
01:10:35,540 --> 01:10:37,440
You need to leave now.

1366
01:10:37,442 --> 01:10:40,245
Your presence only
fuels the demon's power.

1367
01:10:40,279 --> 01:10:42,581
[Emily] Monsignor, please.

1368
01:10:45,450 --> 01:10:47,784
You are the demon.

1369
01:10:47,786 --> 01:10:50,620
You're not an instrument of God.

1370
01:10:50,622 --> 01:10:53,992
Impurities have poisoned
your heart and your soul.

1371
01:10:54,058 --> 01:10:56,228
What have you done, James?

1372
01:10:56,261 --> 01:10:59,162
[eerie music]

1373
01:10:59,164 --> 01:11:01,400
What has he done?

1374
01:11:01,433 --> 01:11:03,800
I'll tell you what he's done.

1375
01:11:03,802 --> 01:11:07,906
If you don't need to,
maybe you're just like him.

1376
01:11:09,841 --> 01:11:12,010
I am not like him.

1377
01:11:12,076 --> 01:11:13,478
Stephen, and you.

1378
01:11:14,513 --> 01:11:17,081
You are not like him.

1379
01:11:17,115 --> 01:11:20,082
[eerie music]

1380
01:11:20,084 --> 01:11:22,921
Do you see the
devil, Monsignor?

1381
01:11:24,155 --> 01:11:26,823
I see nothing, Stephen.

1382
01:11:26,825 --> 01:11:28,927
Expose a child to the worst

1383
01:11:28,960 --> 01:11:32,631
and a priest will
be their salvation.

1384
01:11:32,664 --> 01:11:35,498
[Boy] Tell them how
you took care of me.

1385
01:11:35,500 --> 01:11:37,702
Destroying a child's life

1386
01:11:39,504 --> 01:11:40,939
is not God's way.

1387
01:11:42,006 --> 01:11:43,675
It was for him.

1388
01:11:43,708 --> 01:11:46,209
[ominous music]

1389
01:11:46,211 --> 01:11:47,043
You.

1390
01:11:47,045 --> 01:11:49,681
[ominous music]

1391
01:12:13,238 --> 01:12:14,573
Here, let me help.

1392
01:12:14,639 --> 01:12:16,808
Do not touch him.

1393
01:12:16,841 --> 01:12:19,511
[ominous music]

1394
01:12:29,220 --> 01:12:30,387
Stephen.

1395
01:12:30,389 --> 01:12:32,391
[Monsignor Canell]
Free this child.

1396
01:12:32,424 --> 01:12:33,358
Stephen.

1397
01:12:33,392 --> 01:12:34,223
Come on, Stephen.

1398
01:12:34,225 --> 01:12:35,057
I know you're in there.

1399
01:12:35,059 --> 01:12:36,393
No.

1400
01:12:36,395 --> 01:12:39,063
[ominous music]

1401
01:12:54,045 --> 01:12:55,514
Please, Stephen.

1402
01:12:56,748 --> 01:13:01,353
[speaking in foreign language]
[ominous music]

1403
01:13:33,985 --> 01:13:35,487
We cast you out.

1404
01:13:36,755 --> 01:13:38,457
Every unclean spirit.

1405
01:13:40,959 --> 01:13:43,628
[ominous music]

1406
01:13:46,598 --> 01:13:49,098
Free this child from evil.

1407
01:13:49,100 --> 01:13:52,268
What the hell do
you know about evil?

1408
01:13:52,270 --> 01:13:54,904
We command you, be gone.

1409
01:13:54,906 --> 01:13:57,576
[ominous music]

1410
01:13:58,677 --> 01:14:01,413
Open your eyes, Monsignor.

1411
01:14:01,446 --> 01:14:02,781
Can't you see?

1412
01:14:02,814 --> 01:14:05,484
[ominous music]

1413
01:14:08,520 --> 01:14:09,621
Let him go.

1414
01:14:11,089 --> 01:14:12,591
Please, Stephen.

1415
01:14:13,792 --> 01:14:15,293
We command you.

1416
01:14:15,326 --> 01:14:17,996
[ominous music]

1417
01:14:20,264 --> 01:14:21,097
Come on, come on.

1418
01:14:21,099 --> 01:14:21,931
Our Lord commands you.

1419
01:14:21,933 --> 01:14:22,767
[Randy] Come on.

1420
01:14:22,801 --> 01:14:25,169
[soft music]

1421
01:14:29,173 --> 01:14:30,008
Let.

1422
01:14:31,175 --> 01:14:32,010
Him.

1423
01:14:34,178 --> 01:14:35,344
Go.

1424
01:14:35,346 --> 01:14:38,016
[ominous music]

1425
01:14:50,862 --> 01:14:53,162
[Stephen] Killers, killers.

1426
01:14:53,164 --> 01:14:55,834
[ominous music]

1427
01:15:01,540 --> 01:15:04,240
[Man] You can
do anything, son.

1428
01:15:04,242 --> 01:15:06,242
I've always been
here to help you.

1429
01:15:06,244 --> 01:15:08,913
[ominous music]

1430
01:15:36,240 --> 01:15:39,241
In the name of the
father, of the son,

1431
01:15:39,243 --> 01:15:42,512
and of the holy spirit as it
was in the beginning is now

1432
01:15:42,514 --> 01:15:46,115
and ever shall be
world without end.

1433
01:15:46,117 --> 01:15:46,951
Amen.

1434
01:15:48,119 --> 01:15:50,121
They killed my father.

1435
01:15:52,691 --> 01:15:53,525
Please.

1436
01:15:55,126 --> 01:15:56,795
Tell me you can see.

1437
01:15:59,063 --> 01:16:00,632
I do see, Stephen.

1438
01:16:06,437 --> 01:16:07,271
Mom.

1439
01:16:08,873 --> 01:16:09,708
Stephen.

1440
01:16:11,976 --> 01:16:12,911
[Stephen] Mom.

1441
01:16:12,944 --> 01:16:14,777
Stephen, Stephen.

1442
01:16:14,779 --> 01:16:17,215
[soft music]

1443
01:16:24,055 --> 01:16:25,223
He loved us.

1444
01:16:27,626 --> 01:16:32,296
He tried to save me and he
did everything that he could.

1445
01:16:34,933 --> 01:16:36,267
He didn't leave.

1446
01:16:39,470 --> 01:16:41,172
They took him from us.

1447
01:16:41,239 --> 01:16:43,642
[soft music]

1448
01:16:46,611 --> 01:16:48,110
I'm so sorry.

1449
01:16:48,112 --> 01:16:50,481
[soft music]

1450
01:16:52,183 --> 01:16:54,418
I am so, so sorry.

1451
01:16:54,452 --> 01:16:56,955
I couldn't save any of them.

1452
01:16:58,790 --> 01:17:01,626
You saved many, Stephen,

1453
01:17:01,660 --> 01:17:04,961
by what you've
done here tonight.

1454
01:17:04,963 --> 01:17:07,363
You are a strong, young man.

1455
01:17:07,365 --> 01:17:09,768
[soft music]

1456
01:17:20,812 --> 01:17:22,111
Lord.

1457
01:17:22,113 --> 01:17:23,848
May I be in extremis.

1458
01:17:28,553 --> 01:17:31,055
May I fight every abomination.

1459
01:17:32,190 --> 01:17:34,023
Every corruption.

1460
01:17:34,025 --> 01:17:36,394
[soft music]

1461
01:17:38,863 --> 01:17:43,532
You're gonna believe a
possessed boy, a demon.

1462
01:17:43,534 --> 01:17:45,704
He's trying to destroy us.

1463
01:17:47,038 --> 01:17:48,871
Destroy you.

1464
01:17:48,873 --> 01:17:52,911
You have no idea what I
have had to endure for this.

1465
01:17:52,977 --> 01:17:56,881
Please do not try to
justify these evil acts.

1466
01:17:58,983 --> 01:18:02,320
You deaconized a child abuser.

1467
01:18:02,353 --> 01:18:03,686
[Emily] Michelle.

1468
01:18:03,688 --> 01:18:04,921
Oh baby.

1469
01:18:04,923 --> 01:18:05,757
You did.

1470
01:18:07,225 --> 01:18:11,229
You let it happen under
your watch for 30 years.

1471
01:18:12,563 --> 01:18:13,765
You didn't see.

1472
01:18:15,166 --> 01:18:16,534
I'm not to blame.

1473
01:18:17,736 --> 01:18:19,203
No.

1474
01:18:19,237 --> 01:18:20,837
You.

1475
01:18:20,839 --> 01:18:22,406
This is your fault.

1476
01:18:24,743 --> 01:18:26,077
I am to blame.

1477
01:18:27,846 --> 01:18:32,016
I've blended my trust and
my belief in the church,

1478
01:18:34,518 --> 01:18:36,721
but you need help, my son.

1479
01:18:36,755 --> 01:18:39,190
[soft music]

1480
01:18:51,569 --> 01:18:54,238
[ominous music]

1481
01:19:05,149 --> 01:19:07,151
Detective Kerry, please.

1482
01:19:08,787 --> 01:19:11,120
Monsignor Canell
from Saint Micheal's.

1483
01:19:11,122 --> 01:19:14,125
[suspenseful music]

1484
01:19:32,010 --> 01:19:34,746
[girl screaming]

1485
01:19:50,094 --> 01:19:52,663
[gentle music]

1486
01:19:55,666 --> 01:19:58,835
And I through blindness
have been guilty

1487
01:19:58,837 --> 01:20:03,507
of placing more faith in the
church than in our creator.

1488
01:20:07,111 --> 01:20:08,878
From this day forward I pledge

1489
01:20:08,880 --> 01:20:12,717
to be a vigilant witness
and purveyor of truth

1490
01:20:15,186 --> 01:20:19,223
to eliminate the evils
that have hurt our children

1491
01:20:19,290 --> 01:20:21,390
and plagued our church.

1492
01:20:21,392 --> 01:20:23,795
[soft music]

1493
01:20:26,530 --> 01:20:28,833
Thanks for driving
us down here.

1494
01:20:28,867 --> 01:20:30,366
Yeah.

1495
01:20:30,368 --> 01:20:33,635
I just needed to spend
some time here, you know.

1496
01:20:33,637 --> 01:20:34,472
I do.

1497
01:20:35,840 --> 01:20:39,475
Your father was very
special, Stephen.

1498
01:20:39,477 --> 01:20:40,244
He is.

1499
01:20:46,851 --> 01:20:48,486
I like what we have.

1500
01:20:49,387 --> 01:20:50,554
It's different.

1501
01:20:52,690 --> 01:20:54,723
I just wish he would've
taught me how to aim.

1502
01:20:54,725 --> 01:20:56,660
[Emily] Oh, he did, Stephen.

1503
01:20:56,694 --> 01:20:59,495
[Michelle] Just close your
eyes and you'll remember.

1504
01:20:59,497 --> 01:21:01,931
You can do anything, son.

1505
01:21:01,933 --> 01:21:04,535
I've always been
here to help you.

1506
01:21:04,568 --> 01:21:05,567
I never left.

1507
01:21:05,569 --> 01:21:08,106
[gentle music]

1508
01:22:28,286 --> 01:22:31,956
[Rosemary] You can
never silence me again.

1509
01:22:39,663 --> 01:22:40,496
Oh, come on.

1510
01:22:40,498 --> 01:22:41,832
[Emily] Randy.

1511
01:22:41,866 --> 01:22:43,365
Last chance to see it.

1512
01:22:43,367 --> 01:22:45,136
The people that bought it
are moving in tomorrow.

1513
01:22:45,169 --> 01:22:46,437
Lucky family.

1514
01:22:48,372 --> 01:22:53,311
[Joseph] They were mine
the moment they were born.

1515
01:22:53,344 --> 01:22:54,812
He's still here.

1516
01:22:55,880 --> 01:22:56,680
I know.

1517
01:22:59,383 --> 01:23:00,218
I feel him.

1518
01:23:01,185 --> 01:23:02,018
[Alexa] Dad.

1519
01:23:02,020 --> 01:23:03,021
[hand knocking]

1520
01:23:03,054 --> 01:23:03,988
[Randy] Hey.

1521
01:23:04,022 --> 01:23:05,021
[Emily] Randy, open the door.

1522
01:23:05,023 --> 01:23:05,854
Come on.

1523
01:23:05,856 --> 01:23:07,825
[Randy] Alexa, Emily.

1524
01:23:07,858 --> 01:23:09,193
[Emily] Randy.

1525
01:23:21,872 --> 01:23:24,308
[soft music]

1526
01:23:26,810 --> 01:23:28,546
[Stephen] What the?

1527
01:23:29,413 --> 01:23:31,849
[soft music]

1528
01:23:39,490 --> 01:23:42,758
[girl screaming]

1529
01:23:42,760 --> 01:23:45,429
[Man] Then I saw
there was a way to hell,

1530
01:23:45,496 --> 01:23:47,930
even through the
gates of heaven.

1531
01:23:47,932 --> 01:23:50,368
[soft music]
