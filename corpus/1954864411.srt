00:15:29,541 --> 00:15:31,582
and Mr. Carvelle is a very busy man.

177
00:15:31,708 --> 00:15:33,707
- So am I, actually.

182
00:16:05,958 --> 00:16:07,665
You walked out on me.

183
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:09,999
That was a first.

00:16:11,291 --> 00:16:12,999

and give us a minute?

197
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:16,707
- (DOOR OPENING)
- (CHUCKLING) Wow... wow...

198
00:17:22,916 --> 00:17:24,040
Well?

199
00:17:24,166 --> 00:17:26,040
- No.
- I agree.

200
00:17:26,166 --> 00:17:28,124
For Christ sakes,

201
00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:30,832
the kid probably sings better
than half of this school.

202
00:17:30,958 --> 00:17:35,290
He has neither the desire nor
the discipline for this school.

203
00:17:35,416 --> 00:17:38,499
And he doesn't know
when or where to breathe.

204
00:17:38,625 --> 00:17:40,290
Well, his technique needs work,

205
00:17:40,416 --> 00:17:42,124
but that's to be expected.

206
00:17:42,250 --> 00:17:44,332
There are other considerations as well,

207
00:17:44,458 --> 00:17:47,957
starting with the calendar.
We're well into the fall term

208
00:17:48,083 --> 00:17:50,165
and we only accept new students

209
00:17:50,291 --> 00:17:52,499
at certain periods of the year.

210
00:17:52,625 --> 00:17:54,374
He's too old. Most of the boys here

211
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:57,457
have already had years
of rigorous private training

212
00:17:57,583 --> 00:18:00,624
and they play other instruments
along with voice.

213
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:03,374
Well then, teach him something.

214
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:04,624
Mr. Owens,

215
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:08,874
this is the premier
boychoir school in the nation.

216
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,082
Students here sing
with celebrated orchestras,

217
00:18:11,208 --> 00:18:14,665
they record albums, and
they tour throughout the world.

218
00:18:14,791 --> 00:18:15,707
How much?

219
00:18:15,833 --> 00:18:18,874
You really think you can
just bribe your way in here?

220
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,999
The way of the world, sir.

221
00:18:23,333 --> 00:18:27,707
Uh... that's not exactly how this works.

222
00:18:27,833 --> 00:18:31,290
This is for the entire
first year's tuition,

223
00:18:31,416 --> 00:18:33,540
plus a little something extra.

224
00:18:33,666 --> 00:18:35,415
Consider it a donation.

225
00:19:12,208 --> 00:19:14,582
You're in. It's all taken care of.

226
00:19:14,708 --> 00:19:17,415
You got a roof, meals, spending money.

227
00:19:21,666 --> 00:19:25,207
And... I am going home now.

228
00:19:28,958 --> 00:19:30,999
I thought you weren't going
home till tomorrow.

229
00:19:32,583 --> 00:19:36,832
(CHUCKLING)
You are a smart boy. You'll be okay.

230
00:19:38,125 --> 00:19:40,249
You'll start in the beginners' course.

231
00:19:40,375 --> 00:19:42,499
We have academics in the morning,

232
00:19:42,625 --> 00:19:44,499
singing rehearsals in the afternoon.

233
00:19:44,625 --> 00:19:46,207
Nobody's late. No one's unprepared.

234
00:19:46,333 --> 00:19:49,874
And we'll expect you
to put in at least 10 hours

235
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,707
of individual practice a week.

236
00:19:51,833 --> 00:19:53,832
You've got a lot of catching up to do.

237
00:19:53,958 --> 00:19:55,790
Here we go.

238
00:19:58,416 --> 00:20:00,499
This side's yours.

239
00:20:00,625 --> 00:20:03,207
Now, the morning bell rings at 6.

240
00:20:03,333 --> 00:20:05,790
Breakfast is at 6:30.
Classes start at 7.

241
00:20:05,916 --> 00:20:08,374
And you must be in uniform at all times,

242
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:11,124
except weekends and evenings.
And dinner is at 6.

243
00:20:11,250 --> 00:20:13,999
Now, I'll let you settle in.

244
00:20:15,583 --> 00:20:16,999
Hey, Stet.

245
00:20:18,791 --> 00:20:20,624
You'll be fine.

247
00:20:27,416 --> 00:20:29,540
Yeah, that's fine.
Just give me a call back...

248
00:20:29,666 --> 00:20:31,290
Get this in the bank ASAP, Joanie.

249
00:20:31,416 --> 00:20:33,415
And make out a new file: Stetson Tate.

250
00:20:33,541 --> 00:20:35,457
- Will do.
- Interesting concept, selling

251
00:20:35,583 --> 00:20:38,374
admission to the highest bidder.
Wonderfully American.

252
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:40,415
- Here. The big one, New York.
- New York?

253
00:20:40,541 --> 00:20:42,207
Don't get excited. We didn't get in.

254
00:20:42,333 --> 00:20:44,332
I wish you wouldn't open
my mail, Carvelle.

255
00:20:44,458 --> 00:20:46,540
- It was in my box.
- Holiday concert,

- Vienna Boys' Choir.

258
00:20:51,625 --> 00:20:52,957
It's all politics, probably.

259
00:20:53,083 --> 00:20:55,915
Politics has nothing to do with it.
We're not good enough.

260
00:20:56,041 --> 00:20:57,665
That's a little harsh, isn't it?

261
00:20:57,791 --> 00:21:00,540
We are good enough. He just
doesn't care about winning.

262
00:21:03,416 --> 00:21:06,249
Must be a special kind of torture,

263
00:21:06,375 --> 00:21:08,457

264
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:11,624

about getting a real piano tuner
for this school?

564

He needs help. He needs Carvelle
as his teacher.

706
00:57:34,208 --> 00:57:36,290
Congratulations.

707
00:57:36,416 --> 00:57:38,207
Welcome to the majors.

708
00:57:41,208 --> 00:57:42,999
You got a good voice.

709
00:57:48,208 --> 00:57:50,499
Why so glum?

710
00:57:50,625 --> 00:57:53,874
Don't worry.
You'll get the hang of the road.

711
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:58,207
1,000, 2,000-seat halls,
all those people.

712
00:57:59,208 --> 00:58:01,707
It doesn't matter.
You don't even see 'em.

713
00:58:01,833 --> 00:58:04,624
Just keep up on the music:
me up front, you supporting.

714
00:58:05,625 --> 00:58:07,499
We'll dominate.

(PLAYING PIANO)

720
00:59:01,625 --> 00:59:02,999
I didn't know you were here.

721
00:59:03,125 --> 00:59:06,082
You wanted to see me.

722
00:59:13,416 --> 00:59:17,999
Rachmaninoff was 20
when he composed that.

723
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:23,665
20. Just a few years older than you.

724
00:59:23,791 --> 00:59:26,415
I never knew you could play that well.

725
00:59:27,625 --> 00:59:29,749
Well, I learned it when I was 13.

726
00:59:29,875 --> 00:59:31,832
I played it better then than now.

727
00:59:37,625 --> 00:59:39,874
I'm changing the lineup.

728
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:43,624
Andre's having trouble,
so you're gonna take his place.

729
00:59:44,625 --> 00:59:47,624
You're gonna be in the first
row, third from the right.

730
00:59:50,416 --> 00:59:52,874
I can tell you're nervous already.

731
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:55,499
The truth is, I'm not a religious man,

732
00:59:55,625 --> 00:59:58,707
but this is about as sacred
as you can get, Stet.

733
00:59:58,833 --> 01:00:03,082
This is a community of people
feeling the same thing.

734
01:00:03,208 --> 01:00:05,499
Most of them strangers,

735
01:00:06,225 --> 01:00:09,399
but you are uniting them.

(CHOIR SINGING)

737
01:00:10,625 --> 01:00:13,290
You are giving them your voice.

738
01:00:13,416 --> 01:00:15,749
And that's as spiritual as it gets.

739
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:18,874
Completely flat. I want you leveled.

740
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:20,999

Honey, what do you know
about the National Boychoir?

743
01:01:39,833 --> 01:01:41,499
The what? Wait, what?

744
01:01:41,625 --> 01:01:43,499
We got four tickets in the mail.

745
01:01:43,625 --> 01:01:45,082
Tickets to what?

746
01:01:45,208 --> 01:01:47,499
To a concert of theirs.
Tomorrow, up in New Haven.

747
01:01:47,625 --> 01:01:50,082
- Who sent them?
- I don't know. There's no note.

748
01:01:50,208 --> 01:01:53,082
Uh... ignore it. It's probably
just some promotional thing.

749
01:01:53,208 --> 01:01:55,207
Well, why can't we use them?

750
01:01:55,333 --> 01:01:57,082
It's Yale, it's Woolsey Hall.

751
01:01:57,208 --> 01:01:59,999
I haven't been back to campus
since my reunion. And besides,

752
01:02:00,125 --> 01:02:02,707
when's the last time
we did anything as a family?

753
01:02:02,833 --> 01:02:05,540
- Babe, the girls don't like classical music.
- I like choirs.

754
01:02:05,666 --> 01:02:07,874
Sally, we don't even know who sent them.

755

Who cares?

756
01:02:09,500 --> 01:02:12,707
I think it'd be fun. Don't you, guys?

757
01:02:12,833 --> 01:02:15,165

Aah!

762

Chest cold. Slight fever.
Nothing severe.

763
01:02:37,958 --> 01:02:40,499
In three or four days,
he should be fine.

764
01:02:40,625 --> 01:02:42,249
Doctor, is there anything you can do

765
01:02:42,375 --> 01:02:44,082
to make him sing? The concert's today.

766
01:02:44,208 --> 01:02:47,290
- He's our lead singer.
- Not today he isn't.

- We'll have to cancel.
- Why?

769
01:02:51,208 --> 01:02:53,290
Better to cancel than get it wrong.

770
01:02:53,416 --> 01:02:56,415
We don't need to cancel.
We have someone that can step in.

but the concert is at 3.

I want everybody in the lobby at 1.

Stet. Devon's sick. You'll replace him.

second movement, page 25.

Good luck.

- Gee, Stet, your first solo.
- You're replacing Devon.

- What the...
- Devon!

you guys grow this year.

half of you are down bow.

- It's too late for that.

- I hate Handel.
- Handel hated singers, too.

- What's on the program?

Messiah!

01:10:15,208 --> 01:10:17,874
Something like that would top
the Vienna Boys' Choir.

- It doesn't have a solo part.

also at Eastertide.

what does it matter?

01:10:32,500 --> 01:10:34,082
Well, what about the solo part?

867
01:10:34,208 --> 01:10:36,999
We write a descant.
We write a new solo part.

back in those days.

and hit a high D.

- I'll do it.

- What if you need any help?
- I'll write it.

But can anyone of them
even reach a high D?

873
01:10:49,416 --> 01:10:52,874
- It's either Devon or Stet.
- It'll have to be Devon.

877
01:11:00,416 --> 01:11:02,457
It's about a nine-hour flight, Stet,

878
01:11:02,583 --> 01:11:05,290
but I was able to get you a window.

879
01:11:05,416 --> 01:11:08,415
I do suggest you try and get some sleep.

880
01:11:09,833 --> 01:11:12,999
I know this is a change,
but it is for the best.

881
01:11:15,416 --> 01:11:17,832
Stay where you are, Stet.

882
01:11:21,208 --> 01:11:23,707
- Let's go, now.
- Didn't you hear me?

883
01:11:23,833 --> 01:11:25,415
What?

884
01:11:26,625 --> 01:11:29,332
He's not going with you.

885
01:11:29,458 --> 01:11:32,040
- He's my son.
- Yes, I know.

886
01:11:32,166 --> 01:11:34,207
Your secret son.

887
01:11:35,750 --> 01:11:39,082
It was you, wasn't it?
You're the one that sent those tickets.

888
01:11:39,208 --> 01:11:41,415
Yes, we send tickets to all the parents,

an actual interest

891
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:51,999
This is very simple, Mr. Owens.

892
01:11:52,625 --> 01:11:54,999

I was a few years older
than you. I had a chance.

I was at Juilliard,

975
01:18:49,333 --> 01:18:51,665
and I wanted a piano
more than anything else,

976
01:18:51,791 --> 01:18:54,290
and the teacher I wanted
to impress flunked me

977
01:18:54,416 --> 01:18:57,290
straight out, told me,
and this is a quote...

978
01:18:57,416 --> 01:18:59,415
He said I lacked the talent.

979
01:19:00,416 --> 01:19:04,332
- And that was it. I was gone.
- You just left?

both of them.

1022
01:21:46,041 --> 01:21:48,082

1023

your memory by enumerating examples

1024

behaviour?

that out of personal ambition,
