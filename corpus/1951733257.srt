1
00:00:32,633 --> 00:00:36,233
This is the story
of a time long ago.

2
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:40,100
A time of myth and legend,

3
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:42,500
when the earth
was still young.

4
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:45,700
The ancient gods
were petty and cruel,

5
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:48,900
and they played mankind
for their sport.

6
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:50,900
Aaaagh!

7
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:53,700
Plaguing them with suffering,

8
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:56,500
besieging them with terrors.

9
00:00:56,900 --> 00:00:58,100
( laughing )

10
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:02,500
For centuries, the people
had nowhere to turn,

11
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:04,500
no one to look to for help.

12
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:07,700
Until... he arrived.

13
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:10,500
He was man
like no other.

14
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:13,300
Born of a beautiful
mortal woman,

15
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:16,900
but fathered by Zeus,
king of the gods.

16
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:23,700
Hercules possessed strength
the world had never seen,

17
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:27,700
a strength surpassed
only by the power of his heart.

18
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:32,500
But everywhere he went he was
tormented by his stepmother,

19
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:36,133
Hera, the all-powerful
queen of the gods.

20
00:01:36,133 --> 00:01:39,333
Hera's eternal obsession
was to destroy Hercules,

21
00:01:39,733 --> 00:01:43,733
for he was the constant
living reminder of Zeus' infidelity.

22
00:02:04,533 --> 00:02:06,533
No matter the obstacle,

23
00:02:06,533 --> 00:02:08,933
as long as there were people
crying for help,

24
00:02:08,933 --> 00:02:12,933
there was one man
who would never rest:

25
00:02:12,933 --> 00:02:14,933
Hercules.

26
00:03:07,067 --> 00:03:09,067
( Panting )

27
00:03:27,467 --> 00:03:30,667
You came searching
for Hercules...

28
00:03:30,667 --> 00:03:33,867
- but instead you found your death!
- ( Yells )

29
00:03:35,067 --> 00:03:36,507
( Gurgling )

30
00:03:42,667 --> 00:03:45,867
Hera killed him!
It's only us now!

31
00:03:45,867 --> 00:03:48,667
We must find Hercules
before it's too late!

32
00:04:11,067 --> 00:04:14,267
We're almost there.

33
00:04:29,467 --> 00:04:32,267
You're the last!
It's up to you!

34
00:04:33,467 --> 00:04:35,867

( Chickens Squawking )

40
00:05:57,267 --> 00:05:59,267
There's a giant coming!

41
00:05:59,267 --> 00:06:02,067
- There's a giant coming!
- Where is that water I sent you to get?

42
00:06:02,067 --> 00:06:04,867
- I've told you before: You don't work,
you don't eat!     - But it's true!

43
00:06:05,267 --> 00:06:07,267
I saw him! He's huge!
The ground started to shake--

44
00:06:07,667 --> 00:06:11,267
- "The ground started to shake." What, like this?
- ( Footsteps Approaching )

45
00:06:11,267 --> 00:06:13,267
No, like that!

46

47
00:06:20,467 --> 00:06:22,467

Please. Anything you want.

53
00:06:41,667 --> 00:06:44,867
I want Hercules!

54
00:06:45,267 --> 00:06:49,267
MAN: Hercules?
There's no Hercules here.

55
00:06:49,667 --> 00:06:52,467
What would Hercules be doing
in a crummy place like this?

56
00:06:52,467 --> 00:06:55,667
- Then I kill everybody.
- ( Crowd Protesting )

I'm Hercules.
What can I do for you?

60
00:07:05,667 --> 00:07:09,267
( Laughing ) You are Hercules?

61
00:07:10,867 --> 00:07:14,467
I didn't come all this way
to kill something as small as you.

62
00:07:14,867 --> 00:07:17,267
- Fine by me.
( Giant Grumbles )

63
00:07:17,667 --> 00:07:20,067
Look, why don't you sit down,
have some stew.

64
00:07:20,467 --> 00:07:23,267
First, you.
Then, stew.

65
00:07:23,267 --> 00:07:26,067
Come on, little man.

66
00:07:35,267 --> 00:07:37,667
( Crowd Chattering )
Be careful.

67
00:07:39,667 --> 00:07:42,467
You know,
this really isn't necessary.

68
00:07:42,467 --> 00:07:46,067
- Oh, yes, it is.

( Growd Groans )

74
00:08:05,267 --> 00:08:07,667
Looks like Hercules has
finally met this match.

75
00:08:07,667 --> 00:08:11,267
I beg your pardon, sir.
I don't think so.

76
00:08:11,267 --> 00:08:16,067
- What do you know, old man?
- Oh, I know about these things.

77
00:08:17,667 --> 00:08:22,067
- ( Laughing )
- Maybe we do have to do this.

Huh?

89

Here's to Hercules,
slayer of giants!

Bravo!

92
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:16,600
Our little village will be famous
forever. To show our appreciation...

93
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,200
- we're going to build a shrine to you, Hercules!
- ( Crowd Cheering )

94
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:23,000
No shrine, thanks.

95
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,400
I wouldn't know
what to do with one.

96

- ( Chuckles )
- But you must want something.

97
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:30,600
- All the gods want something.
- I'm not a god.

98
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:34,200
I don't want anything.
I just want to finish my meal.

( Panting, Gasps )

100
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:40,600

( Gasping )
Are you Hercules?

102
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:59,800
- A hundred of us were sent to find you.
- Bring him water.

103
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:03,000
You're safe here.
Where are the rest?

104
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,200
Dead. All dead.

105
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:09,400
Killed by the queen
of the gods.

106
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:13,400
She didn't want us to find you.

107
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:15,800
- Hera.
- Hercules...

108
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:18,200
you have to help us.

109
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:20,200
We've been driven
from our city...

110
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:22,600
and all our best warriors killed.

111
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:25,400
We've done nothing wrong...

112
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:27,800
and still the goddess punishes us.

113
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:31,400
Please, take our side.
Help us.

114
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:36,600
- What city is this, my friend?
- The lost city of Troy.

115
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:37,920
Troy? Troy?

116
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:43,400
- I'll find it.
- But you can't.

117
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:47,400
It's lost in the mist.
Only I can lead you back.

118
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:50,200
Then you will.
Now drink and rest.

- Where do you think you're going?
- ( Chuckles )

126
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,800
- You were great with that giant.
- Forget about the giant.

127
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:32,600
- How do I find Troy?
- Hercules, don't get involved.

128
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:36,200
Involved? Hera killed
that messenger in my arms.

129
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:39,400
She does strange things.
She's the queen of the gods.

130
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:43,000
- You're supposed to be king.
- Who says I'm not?

131
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:49,000
Hercules, if you were only
nice to your stepmother.

132
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:53,800
I mean, if you went into one of
her temples and did a small sacrifice.

133
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:57,800
- You've got to be kidding.
- Then you'll never find Troy.

134
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:00,600
She's vanished it.

135
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,400
So you're not gonna
help me, again.

136
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,200
Oh, how can I explain?

137
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:10,200
I can't.

138
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,600
Fine. Thanks, Father.
- Hey, w-wait a second.

139
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:19,800
Wait a second.
I probably shouldn't tell you this...

140
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:23,800
but you must find
the one, true compass.

141
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:27,800
It points directly to Troy.

142
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:31,800
King Omphale had it last.

I can't tell you any more.

145
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,200
You'll have to find it yourself.

146
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:44,200
Why don't you come with me?

147
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:51,000
Oh, if I were only
a thousand years younger...

148
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000

- Whose shrine is this?
- The shrine of the water god.

154
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:20,133
He withholds the rain,
and we have nothing to eat.

No, no! This is for the water god,
in case he gets hungry while waiting.

- What's he waiting for?
- The virgin.

159
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:37,267
She's going to fall
to her death in honor of him.

160
00:14:37,267 --> 00:14:41,633
Sir, human sacrifices don't work.

161

down from there.

Go away.

Yeah, well, if you're sacrificing
yourself to the water god...

That was close.
You almost fell.

to fall, you idiot!

see a sacrifice?

So you're a maiden
at the height of her fertility?

177
00:15:38,667 --> 00:15:41,067
You've spoiled it.

178
00:15:41,067 --> 00:15:43,467
It took all morning
for the rope to burn through.

179
00:15:43,467 --> 00:15:46,267
You have no right to interfere
with my destiny with the gods.

180
00:15:46,267 --> 00:15:49,067
Take my word for it.
The gods don't care about your destiny.

181
00:15:49,067 --> 00:15:53,067
- And who are you that you know so much?
- I'm Hercules.

182
00:15:53,067 --> 00:15:56,667
Your parents named you after Hercules?
What a laugh.

183
00:15:56,667 --> 00:15:59,467
I don't have time for this.
I have to get to Troy.

184
00:15:59,467 --> 00:16:03,467
No! Put me down!
This is between me and the gods.

185
00:16:03,467 --> 00:16:05,467
Would you stop squirming
or we'll both fall.

186
00:16:14,667 --> 00:16:16,667
What's the matter
with your people?

187
00:16:16,667 --> 00:16:20,267
She said her destiny
is to be with the gods.

188
00:16:20,267 --> 00:16:23,067
The gods don't care
about her or you.

189
00:16:23,067 --> 00:16:25,867
My own father's one.
I wouldn't trust him with my sister...

190
00:16:26,267 --> 00:16:28,267
- if I had a sister.
- Which I hope you don't.

191
00:16:28,667 --> 00:16:31,067
Which I'm glad I don't.

192
00:16:31,067 --> 00:16:35,067
Forget the gods.
You can get along without them.

193
00:16:36,667 --> 00:16:40,267
If it doesn't rain, irrigate.

194
00:16:44,267 --> 00:16:46,667
I wouldn't stay here
if I were you.

195
00:16:48,267 --> 00:16:49,347
Hey!

196
00:16:50,267 --> 00:16:53,067
If you really are Hercules...

197
00:16:53,067 --> 00:16:57,067
then, obviously, I wasn't meant
to drown in that mud hole...

198
00:16:57,067 --> 00:16:59,467
which is why you came along.

199
00:16:59,467 --> 00:17:01,467
You're part of my destiny...

200
00:17:01,867 --> 00:17:03,867
- which means you're working for me.
- Look, kid...

201
00:17:03,867 --> 00:17:05,867
I've already got
something important to do.

202
00:17:06,267 --> 00:17:07,867
There's a whole city
waiting for my help.

203
00:17:08,267 --> 00:17:10,267
Unfortunately, it's a lost city,
which makes it harder to find.

204
00:17:10,267 --> 00:17:13,467
But you must have been sent to help me,
whether you know it or not.

205
00:17:13,467 --> 00:17:16,267
I've decided the best thing to do
is to travel together.

206
00:17:16,267 --> 00:17:18,267
- Is that right?
- That's right.

207
00:17:18,267 --> 00:17:20,667
Until the gods show me a sign.

208
00:17:20,667 --> 00:17:23,067
If you're gonna follow me,
you better keep up with me.

209
00:17:23,467 --> 00:17:25,467
I can keep up with you.

210
00:17:25,467 --> 00:17:29,067
- What's your name?
- Deianeira.

211
00:17:29,067 --> 00:17:31,467
Well, Deianeira...

212
00:17:31,867 --> 00:17:34,267
when was the last time you ate?

213
00:17:34,667 --> 00:17:38,667
I never eat.
Food's a luxury I don't have time for.

214
00:17:46,267 --> 00:17:51,067
So, of course, it was only natural
I'd give my life over to public service.

215
00:17:51,467 --> 00:17:57,067
See, my father was
this really handsome king...

216
00:17:57,067 --> 00:18:01,867
who loved me more than
anything in the world.

217
00:18:01,867 --> 00:18:04,267
But then when his kingdom
was threatened...

218
00:18:04,667 --> 00:18:06,267
he sent me away
for my own good.

219
00:18:07,867 --> 00:18:11,067
I think he made quite
a sacrifice, don't you?

220
00:18:11,467 --> 00:18:14,433
That's a well-known fairy tale,
Deianeira.

221
00:18:14,433 --> 00:18:17,633
My mother used to tell it to me.
Who told it to you?

222
00:18:18,033 --> 00:18:20,433
I told it to myself, all right?

223
00:18:20,433 --> 00:18:24,033
- You don't think orphans need fairy tales too?
- Sure I do.

224
00:18:24,033 --> 00:18:28,033
- We all do.
- What do you know about it? Your father's a god.

225
00:18:28,033 --> 00:18:31,633
Well, he wasn't home much,
I can tell you that.

226
00:18:31,633 --> 00:18:34,033
Yeah, well...

227
00:18:34,033 --> 00:18:39,633
my father is this really
homesome king...

228
00:18:39,633 --> 00:18:44,433
who love me more than
anything in the world.

229
00:18:55,633 --> 00:18:58,033
Sweet dreams, kid.

230
00:19:32,733 --> 00:19:36,333
Who are you?
Why do you follow me?

231
00:19:36,333 --> 00:19:38,733
If you're protecting me, here I am.

232
00:19:38,733 --> 00:19:41,933
I could use protecting.
Wait!

233
00:19:43,533 --> 00:19:47,133
- Who are you talking to?
- Nobody.

234
00:19:55,167 --> 00:19:57,167
I heard you--

235
00:20:11,067 --> 00:20:14,267
DEIANERIA: Don't just stand there.
You're blocking the road!

236
00:20:14,267 --> 00:20:16,667
Will you get out of my way,
you mountain of meat?

237
00:20:16,667 --> 00:20:20,267
- No one passes today.
- I've come to speak to the king.

238
00:20:20,267 --> 00:20:22,267
- The king is dead.
- The king's dead?

239
00:20:22,267 --> 00:20:24,667
- That's right.
- I was sent by Zeus himself.

240
00:20:24,667 --> 00:20:28,267
There must be someone I can see.
It's very important. Come on.

241
00:20:28,667 --> 00:20:31,067
Too bad. You and Zeus are
six years late.

242
00:20:31,067 --> 00:20:34,267
- And no one passes today.
- Do you know who you're talking to?

243
00:20:34,267 --> 00:20:37,467
This is Hercules.
You better get out of our way.

244
00:20:37,467 --> 00:20:41,067
Or he'll crush your skull like a
bird egg and make all the gooop run out.

245
00:20:41,067 --> 00:20:41,907
Please.

246
00:20:43,467 --> 00:20:47,067
Well, who's in charge of the kingdom?
I have to see him.

247
00:20:47,067 --> 00:20:49,467
Our queen sees no one.
She appears in public...

248
00:20:49,467 --> 00:20:52,267
- only once a year at the great slave market.
- Which is today.

249
00:20:52,667 --> 00:20:55,467
The slave market?
That's outrageous.

250
00:20:55,467 --> 00:20:58,267
How'd you like to be a slave?

251
00:20:58,267 --> 00:21:02,667
But I guess you already are.
Slaves to the slave market.

252
00:21:02,667 --> 00:21:04,667
Does she belong to you?

253
00:21:04,667 --> 00:21:07,467
- You could teach her some manners.
- She belongs to no one.

254
00:21:07,467 --> 00:21:11,467
Twin half- wits, huh?
Mom and Dad must be really proud.

255
00:21:11,467 --> 00:21:15,067
Come here! We can get more for her at
the market after I cut out her tongue.

256
00:21:15,067 --> 00:21:19,100
- This will just take a moment.
- Yeah, I know.

257
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:22,300
- ( Yells )
- ( Grunting )

258
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:30,700
Wow.

259
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:36,700
From now on, be quiet.

260
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:39,100
I'll do the talking.

261
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:41,500
I was only trying to help.

262
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:45,500
- I don't need your help.
- You're so ungrateful.

263
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:49,500
- You don't thank me. All you do is tell me
what to do. - Remember what I told you.

264
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:53,100
- Let you do the talking.
- That's right.

265
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:04,700
Greetings.
I'm here to see the queen.

266
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:06,700
- I was sent by the king of the gods.
- How did you pass the brothers?

267
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:10,700
Stop him, Brothers!

268
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:13,100
Prepare to die, trespasser!

269
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:13,950
( Both Grunting )

270
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:20,300
Don't let him get away!

271
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:25,900
- ( Grunts )
- ( Yelling, Groans )

272
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:29,100
I love this.

273
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:31,100
I'm glad you're enjoying yourself.

274
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:35,100
How many of you brothers
are there?

275
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:38,300
We are the 48 sons of Martinus,
guardians of the gate.

276
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:41,100
On the blood of my brothers,
now you will die!

277
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:45,900
- ( Yells )
- And now you will die!

278
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:53,100
( Brother Growling )

279
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:57,100
- ( Brothers Gasp )
- Only 42 more to go.

280
00:22:57,100 --> 00:23:00,300
- Not that way.
- What?

281
00:23:00,300 --> 00:23:04,300
- How'd I ever get mixed up with you anyway?
- Oh, that's great.

282
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:19,900
Why are we sneaking in?
We were doing great.

283
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:22,300
I have to talk to the queen
about a compass...

284
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:25,900
not leave a trail of bodies
48-brothers long.

285
00:23:26,300 --> 00:23:30,300
Surely there must be
as easier way than this.

286

- ( Deianeira Screams )
- ( Chickens Squawking )

287
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:36,300
( Groaning )
What did you push me for?

288
00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:39,900
- I didn't push you. You fell.
- No, you pushed me.

289
00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:41,900
Now, listen, behave yourself.

290
00:23:42,300 --> 00:23:43,900
This is a big city,
so keep your mouth shut.

291
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:48,700
Don't tell me what to do.
I've been in a big city before.

( Crowd Chattering, Sheep Bleating )

Hey, hey, try my rabbit.
Try it.

296
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:30,700
- Hungry?
- Yeah.

297
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:32,700
- How much?
- For you, nothing.

298
00:24:33,100 --> 00:24:35,500
Tell your friends.
Tell them, tell them!

299
00:24:37,900 --> 00:24:40,300
This rabbit tastes funny.

300
00:24:40,300 --> 00:24:42,300
That's because it's possum.

- ( Spits, Gagging )
- MAN: Welcome!

302

Welcome, everyone,
to the queen's slave market!

303
00:24:47,900 --> 00:24:53,100
For our first item today, we have this
attractive former princess of Thessaly.

304
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:55,500
Still listed as a virgin...

305
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:58,300
and with excellent references
up and down the country.

306
00:24:58,300 --> 00:25:00,700
She's anxious to find
a domestic position...

307
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:03,100
and she can start immediately.

308
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:06,700

I'll think of something.

316
00:25:28,300 --> 00:25:32,700
So, you're calling him Hercules, huh?
It might work.

317
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:35,100
He is Hercules.
Look at him.

318
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:41,100
Ouch.
You convinced me, kid.

319
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:43,900
Like to come this way,
uh, Hercules.

320
00:25:55,100 --> 00:25:59,100

son of Zeus!

I put myself up for sale...

00:27:33,100 --> 00:27:35,500
There's plenty of time for that
when you're completed your work here.

343
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:37,100
- ( Sets Down Drink )
- Of course.

344
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:40,700
- What is it you want of me?
- Hercules, the best thing about being queen...

345
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:43,900
is that I can make a holiday
whenever I want.

346
00:27:43,900 --> 00:27:46,700
I've decided no one will work
in my kingdom today.

347
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:52,700
So rest here,
and tomorrow we'll see.

348
00:27:52,700 --> 00:27:55,500
Apologies, My Queen.
You only have me for the day.

349
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:59,500
But I paid for a thousand days.

350
00:27:59,900 --> 00:28:03,900
- ( Coins Clink )
- But this is way too much for one day's work.

351
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:07,100
( Shushing ) If you find
any more Hercules like that...

352
00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:09,100
you just bring them to me.

353
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:38,300
- Is someone hitting his door--
- With a rock?

354
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:40,700
Yeah, me.
Where's Hercules?

355
00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:43,500
I need to talk to him.

356
00:28:43,900 --> 00:28:46,300
This door is over
a thousand years old...

357
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:48,700
and, in five minutes,
you've made dents in it.

358
00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:52,700
Excuse me, eunuch. I just gave you
a message to give to Hercules.

359
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:56,300
Hercules is unavailable
for the foreseeable future.

360
00:28:56,300 --> 00:28:59,900
- I'm not a eunuch, I'm a slave.
- What's the difference?

361
00:28:59,900 --> 00:29:02,700
( Scoffs ) Uh--

362
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:04,700
I'll tell you
when you grow up.

363
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:16,700
Lovely kumquats,
two for a dinar.

364
00:29:16,700 --> 00:29:19,900
- I hate kumquats.
- I make a bargain.

- ( Growls )
- WOMAN: Welcome, slave.

373
00:30:45,333 --> 00:30:46,933
Do I look like a slave?

374
00:30:47,333 --> 00:30:49,033
Just give me the menu.

375
00:30:49,033 --> 00:30:51,467
- I'll be back in a minute.
DEIANEIRA: I'll have the wild chicken.

376
00:30:51,467 --> 00:30:55,133
- And to drink?
- She doesn't like slaves.

377
00:30:55,133 --> 00:30:58,833
- That--   - You can be frank here,
even tyrannical, if you want.

378
00:30:58,833 --> 00:31:02,900
- She's a master?
- Look, can I get some service or what?

379
00:31:02,900 --> 00:31:07,533
Why don't you come to my table, huh?
The wild chicken's gonna take a while.

380
00:31:07,533 --> 00:31:10,333
First, you gotta chase 'em,
then you gotta catch 'em.

381

- These girls work for the government too.
- Mm-hmm.

382
00:31:13,133 --> 00:31:17,533
- You're all slave? Happy slaves?
- We have financial security...

383
00:31:17,533 --> 00:31:20,333
steady work and no chance
of being fired.

384
00:31:20,333 --> 00:31:23,533
- You're miserable, and you don't even know it.
- ( Laughing )

385
00:31:23,533 --> 00:31:27,133
You should be fighting to be free,
fighting to the death.

- Appetizer.
- Food.

387

When was the last time you ate?

388
00:31:35,533 --> 00:31:38,333
We get three squares a day working for the
government and a roof over our heads.

389
00:31:38,333 --> 00:31:41,533
- Mm-hmm.
- A toast to Queen Omphale.

Salute.

391
00:31:43,533 --> 00:31:45,933
You call this a chicken?

392
00:31:45,933 --> 00:31:49,933
It's small and tough because it had
to make it on its own.

393
00:31:49,933 --> 00:31:52,000
No offense.

Just a moment, you.

I am Princess Deianeira
of Thessalonia...

and these slaves belong
to the royal household.

401

It's just business, miss.

402
00:32:25,767 --> 00:32:28,400
How much do they owe?

403
00:32:31,100 --> 00:32:35,533

three weeks behind.

he'll just want double next week.

Unless you really are a princess.

414

You slept well, I trust.
You must be hungry.

I've no right to rest like this.

- My journey is urgent.
- Eat something. You need your strength.

417
00:33:55,300 --> 00:33:58,900
What I need is the compass
that points me to Troy.

418
00:34:01,700 --> 00:34:04,500
OMPHALE: These are my late husband's
navigational instruments.

419

With them, he traversed the world.

420

They can guide you
to where you want to go.

421
00:34:14,900 --> 00:34:19,300
Take what you want of them.
They mean nothing to me.

Thank you, Queen Omphale.

423

she might not be waiting anymore.

chance, Princess Dead Squirrel Meat?

- It's not up to me, is it?

- Be a girl, and then a woman.
- Just a woman?

My mother's "just a woman,"
and everyone loves her.

489

Which is why Hera hates my guts.

tweaked their nose.

511
00:41:38,700 --> 00:41:41,100
You saved my life
back at the bar.

512
00:41:41,100 --> 00:41:44,700
I've decided to devote the rest
of my time to your service.

513
00:41:44,700 --> 00:41:47,900
- Don't you want to be free?
- I can serve as a free man.

514
00:41:47,900 --> 00:41:50,300
- I don't need a free man either.
- I don't think you realize...

515
00:41:50,300 --> 00:41:53,500
how truly useful
an obsequious person can be.

516
00:41:55,500 --> 00:41:58,300
( Brushing )

517
00:41:58,700 --> 00:42:03,100
You worm! Haven't you got
any self-respect? Look at yourself!

518
00:42:03,100 --> 00:42:06,700
Hey, what do you want?
I'm a professional slave.

519
00:42:06,700 --> 00:42:09,100
It's what I do,
and I do it well.

520
00:42:09,100 --> 00:42:12,700
You have to admire a man
who knows what he's good at.

521
00:42:12,700 --> 00:42:14,700
I await your command.

522
00:42:15,100 --> 00:42:17,500
All right. Here's my command.

523
00:42:17,900 --> 00:42:19,900
Return directly
to Omphale's kingdom...

524
00:42:19,900 --> 00:42:22,300
and serve her
for the rest of your life.

525
00:42:23,900 --> 00:42:25,900
Is that what you really want?

526
00:42:25,900 --> 00:42:26,980
Yes!

527
00:42:27,900 --> 00:42:30,300
Then I must obey.

528
00:42:30,300 --> 00:42:33,100
You'll never see me again,
either of you.

529
00:42:33,100 --> 00:42:34,700
But know this, master:

530
00:42:35,100 --> 00:42:36,700
Whomever I serve in the future...

531
00:42:36,700 --> 00:42:39,500
I dedicate my servitude to you.

532
00:42:39,500 --> 00:42:41,900
Waylin--

533
00:42:42,300 --> 00:42:44,700
Thank you.

534
00:43:21,900 --> 00:43:24,300
Great.
We come all this way...

535
00:43:24,300 --> 00:43:27,500
and now your one, true compass
is pointing to nowhere.

536
00:43:27,500 --> 00:43:30,300
( Scoffs )
I suppose it's broken now.

537
00:43:33,100 --> 00:43:35,500
It's not broken.

538
00:43:35,500 --> 00:43:37,900
Well, my destiny
doesn't stop here.

539
00:43:37,900 --> 00:43:40,300
Somebody's did.

540
00:43:57,500 --> 00:44:01,100
Look at this boneyard.

541
00:44:02,700 --> 00:44:05,500
Troy must be on the other side
of this ocean.

542
00:44:05,900 --> 00:44:08,300
How are we going to get across?
We don't have a boat.

543
00:44:08,700 --> 00:44:11,500
Rise.
Rise, Blue Serpent...

544
00:44:11,900 --> 00:44:15,100
and to the work
that Hera asks of you.

545
00:44:15,500 --> 00:44:19,500
Hercules, I feel
something happening.

546
00:44:21,900 --> 00:44:24,700
HERCULES: Who is that? Is that
the man who's been following you?

547
00:44:25,100 --> 00:44:27,900
It's my protector,
Hercules. ( Gasps )

548
00:44:28,300 --> 00:44:29,900
Some protector.

549
00:44:32,700 --> 00:44:35,500
- ( Roaring )
- ( Deianeira Screams )

550

( Screaming )

551
00:45:03,633 --> 00:45:07,133
Did you see that?
It came straight for me.

552
00:45:07,133 --> 00:45:10,567
- I noticed.
- I told you my place was with the gods.

553
00:45:10,567 --> 00:45:15,833
Deianeira, I don't think
the gods hang out in here.

554
00:45:18,233 --> 00:45:20,733
But they accepted me.
That's all that matters.

555
00:45:20,733 --> 00:45:23,733
I don't know why you're excited.
We're about to be digested.

556
00:45:24,233 --> 00:45:26,133
Don't you understand?
This is supposed to happen.

557
00:45:26,633 --> 00:45:31,000
No, that's what's supposed to happen.

558
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:34,433
That's the wrong way out.

559
00:45:34,433 --> 00:45:36,433
This way.

560
00:45:42,033 --> 00:45:44,433
( Heart Beating )

561
00:45:44,433 --> 00:45:46,033
Stay here.

- Hold on. I'll come back for you.

- ( Screams )
- ( Screeching )

578
00:48:50,900 --> 00:48:53,700
Did you kill it? Did you kill it?
Is it dead? Is it dead?

579
00:48:53,700 --> 00:48:56,100
It's dead!
We've got to get outta here!

580
00:48:56,500 --> 00:48:58,500
- ( Panting )
- Give me your hand.

( Screeching Continues )

583
00:49:57,700 --> 00:50:00,100
It's Troy, Hercules.

584
00:50:00,500 --> 00:50:02,100
HERCULES: How do you know?

585
00:50:02,500 --> 00:50:04,900
I remember now.

586
00:50:04,900 --> 00:50:07,300
It's where I'm from.

587
00:50:40,100 --> 00:50:42,500
Why are you stopping now?
We're almost there?

588
00:50:42,900 --> 00:50:46,100
HERCULES: Something's not right.
We could be walking into a trap.

589
00:50:46,100 --> 00:50:49,700
Hercules, you still don't believe
my whole life's been a journey here.

590
00:50:50,100 --> 00:50:52,100
Whatever the gods intend...

591
00:50:52,100 --> 00:50:55,700
- I will fulfill, with or without you.
- I'm pretty sure it's a trap.

592
00:50:56,100 --> 00:50:58,500
Then without you, and fine by me.

593

( Struggling )

595
00:51:06,900 --> 00:51:10,900
( Sighs ) Of course,
I could be wrong.

596
00:51:10,900 --> 00:51:14,133
Will you get me down?
Get me down, Hercules!

597
00:51:14,133 --> 00:51:18,533
I've already killed you, spy,
but for information to please my king...

598
00:51:18,533 --> 00:51:21,733
- I may loan you back your life.
- Kill him, Hercules!

( Sighs )

600
00:51:25,733 --> 00:51:30,533
- We're your prisoners. We won't resist.
- The hell we are!

601
00:51:30,933 --> 00:51:34,533
- I'll die right here before you keep me from my city.
- Your city?

602
00:51:34,533 --> 00:51:36,933
The city is ours, and though
we may live in the woods now...

603
00:51:37,333 --> 00:51:40,533
the people of Troy will one day retake
their homes and be exiles no more.

604
00:51:40,933 --> 00:51:42,533
Take us to your king.

605
00:51:42,933 --> 00:51:46,600
Hercules, you want us to be captured?
I bow to no king.

- ( Deianeira Gasps )

You will bow
to the King of Troy...

your foot touched our shore.

- You found her.
- As you predicted, My King.

618
00:52:47,400 --> 00:52:50,600
- An easy snare.
- Hey, what's going on here?

619
00:52:50,600 --> 00:52:53,000
Tell me your name, young woman.

620
00:52:55,400 --> 00:52:57,800
- Deianeira.
- Deianeira.

621
00:52:58,200 --> 00:53:02,200
I don't understand.
I thought they were spies.

622
00:53:02,200 --> 00:53:05,400
Will you leave us, my friends?

623
00:53:12,400 --> 00:53:14,800
Are you my father?

624
00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:16,533
Yes.

625
00:53:17,033 --> 00:53:19,367
Yeah, but I gotta
figure this out.

626
00:53:19,367 --> 00:53:21,633
You're king.
The king of what?

627
00:53:21,633 --> 00:53:24,067
The King of Troy?
How come you live in the woods?

628
00:53:24,467 --> 00:53:27,667
Your words still spill out.

629
00:53:27,667 --> 00:53:31,700
Deianeira, I did a terrible thing...

630
00:53:31,700 --> 00:53:34,900
which I've kept hidden
all these years.

631
00:53:34,900 --> 00:53:39,300
You were such a beautiful child...

632
00:53:39,300 --> 00:53:41,700
that Hera demanded
I sacrifice you...

633
00:53:41,700 --> 00:53:44,100
to her sea monster.

634
00:53:44,100 --> 00:53:46,500
I couldn't do it.

635
00:53:46,500 --> 00:53:49,700
I sent away,
across the sea.

636
00:53:49,700 --> 00:53:53,300
Yes, I saved you...

637
00:53:53,300 --> 00:53:55,300
but Hera was angry.

638
00:53:55,700 --> 00:53:58,900
She sent Blue Priest
to drive us out of the city...

639
00:53:59,300 --> 00:54:02,100
to live in the forest as exiles.

640
00:54:02,500 --> 00:54:05,300
And only I knew why.

641
00:54:05,700 --> 00:54:07,300

I loved you too much.

643
00:54:14,100 --> 00:54:18,500

644
00:54:18,500 --> 00:54:21,700
for one, tiny girl.

645
00:54:21,700 --> 00:54:26,900
No, you sacrificed your own heart
to keep me alive.

646
00:54:26,900 --> 00:54:30,500
I found my way back,
as you knew I would.

647

- He taught us how to live...

when we were driven
from Troy...

662
00:55:36,800 --> 00:55:41,200
and that the spirit
of our people cannot be broken.

663
00:55:41,200 --> 00:55:46,000
We must never forget him
and the city that he loved.

664

- This is Hercules.
- CROWD: Hercules.

665
00:55:49,200 --> 00:55:53,600
He can teach us how to fight
and win back our homes.

Yes. Yes.

00:56:07,600 --> 00:56:10,400
Let's charge the city right now,
Hercules, and see...

669
00:56:10,800 --> 00:56:13,600
how many each one of us
kills before he dies.

670
00:56:15,600 --> 00:56:18,400
There must be a better way
than a frontal attack.

671
00:56:18,800 --> 00:56:22,400
That would be the coward's way.

672
00:56:22,400 --> 00:56:26,800
Well, we certainly wouldn't want to take
the coward's way, would we, Telamon?

673
00:56:26,800 --> 00:56:30,000
Because that way some of us
might get out of this alive.

- It shall be done.

I'm not a spy!
Whoa! I'm a slave!

682
00:57:47,800 --> 00:57:50,600
Well, the people of Troy
do not allow slaves.

683
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:53,000
That's all right.
I'm used to prejudice.

684
00:57:53,400 --> 00:57:55,400
- You're coming with me. Come on!
- Careful, it's a thin cloth.

685
00:57:55,800 --> 00:57:58,200
Go on! Get a move on.
Move, move.

686
00:57:58,200 --> 00:58:00,200
- After you.
- Straight up the hill.

687
00:58:00,200 --> 00:58:02,200
- Oh.
- Come on.

688
00:58:02,200 --> 00:58:04,600
Ooh, Zeus, it's a nice day.

689
00:58:14,200 --> 00:58:18,200
No. Face the target
at a right angle.

690
00:58:18,200 --> 00:58:20,200
Don't square off, okay?

691
00:58:28,200 --> 00:58:30,600
You want to grip
the bow in the middle.

692
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:33,400
Hold onto it like you have
a bird in your hand.

693
00:58:37,400 --> 00:58:41,800
Maybe we should find
a different weapon for you.

694
00:58:44,600 --> 00:58:47,000
- Use your back more when you draw back.
- All right.

695
00:58:49,800 --> 00:58:52,600
Deianeira, you have to get
yourself into a rhythm,

696
00:58:57,400 --> 00:59:00,200
You notch...

697
00:59:00,200 --> 00:59:02,200
draw..

698
00:59:02,200 --> 00:59:04,200
aim...

699
00:59:04,200 --> 00:59:06,200
release.

700
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:11,800
That's good.
You have steady hands.

701
00:59:11,800 --> 00:59:13,800
You can make them tremble.

702
00:59:16,600 --> 00:59:20,600
Uh, next time,
bend your left elbow a little more.

703
00:59:28,600 --> 00:59:32,200
Pull back on that more,
using your back. Good.

704
00:59:33,800 --> 00:59:35,800
You shoot well.

705
00:59:35,800 --> 00:59:38,600
So why do we need him?

706
00:59:41,400 --> 00:59:43,800
( Chuckles )
He's Hercules.

707
00:59:43,800 --> 00:59:46,600
WAYLIN: Ow! I work a lot better
without a knife in my back!

708
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:49,400
- Just get on there.
- Excuse me. What's your name?

709
00:59:49,400 --> 00:59:52,200
- Just keep moving!
- "Just keep moving"? Is that a first name or a last?

710
00:59:52,600 --> 00:59:54,600
- Just keep moving.
- DEIANEIRA: Waylin!

711
00:59:54,600 --> 00:59:58,600
- How did you find us?
- Oh, it wasn't easy. I wore the wrong shoes.

712
00:59:58,600 --> 01:00:00,600
Waylin, what are you doing here?

713
01:00:00,600 --> 01:00:05,000
Hercules, you know,
the more I thought about it...

714
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:07,400
the more I think
you're making a big mistake.

715
01:00:07,400 --> 01:00:10,600
You need me as a slave,
a good slave...

716
01:00:10,600 --> 01:00:12,600
a slave who knows
how to be obedient...

717
01:00:12,600 --> 01:00:16,200
- even if it means being a pain in the ass.
- "Obedient"?

718
01:00:16,200 --> 01:00:18,200
I ordered you home,
and you've disobeyed me.

719
01:00:18,200 --> 01:00:20,200
That's a good point.

720
01:00:20,200 --> 01:00:23,400
But what I'm trying to tell you,
without being obsequious...

721
01:00:23,400 --> 01:00:25,800
is that my place
is here with you.

722
01:00:25,800 --> 01:00:28,600
Yeah.

723
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:31,000
Give me that.
Come with me.

724
01:00:31,400 --> 01:00:33,400
Can we get something to eat?

725
01:00:36,600 --> 01:00:41,800
MAN: What do you think, Hercules?
Do we stand a chance?

726
01:00:41,800 --> 01:00:44,600
I've watched you training.

727
01:00:44,600 --> 01:00:47,800
There's nothing wrong
with your swords or your bows...

728
01:00:48,200 --> 01:00:50,200
but the enemy has them too.

729
01:00:50,200 --> 01:00:53,000
It's difficult to be a warrior.

730
01:00:53,400 --> 01:00:56,600
It's not easy to kill.

731
01:00:58,200 --> 01:01:01,800
You have to make yourself hard.

732
01:01:01,800 --> 01:01:04,600
I want every fighter to find
his own rock and study it.

733
01:01:04,600 --> 01:01:09,100
You have weapons
for your hands already.

734
01:01:09,500 --> 01:01:12,300
Make a rock your weapon within...

735
01:01:12,300 --> 01:01:16,300
because a rock has no mind or heart...

736
01:01:16,300 --> 01:01:19,100
or hope or fear.

737
01:01:19,100 --> 01:01:23,900
If you're to succeed in battle, you must
rid yourselves of all of that...

738
01:01:23,900 --> 01:01:25,900
and be hard.

739
01:01:25,900 --> 01:01:29,100
If we have to be hard like rocks...

740
01:01:29,500 --> 01:01:32,300
to win our city back...

741
01:01:32,300 --> 01:01:34,300
then we'll be rocks.

742
01:01:34,700 --> 01:01:37,900
You'll see. Won't we?

743
01:01:37,900 --> 01:01:40,700
( Crowd Cheering )
Yes! Won't we!

744
01:01:40,700 --> 01:01:44,300
( Cheering Continues )

745
01:01:54,300 --> 01:01:57,500
The people know
that you're behind us.

746
01:01:57,500 --> 01:01:59,900
It means everything
to them, Hercules.

747
01:02:01,900 --> 01:02:03,500
Thank you.

748
01:02:03,900 --> 01:02:06,700
They still have to fight.

749
01:02:07,100 --> 01:02:09,500
They just don't get
the idea of combat.

750
01:02:09,500 --> 01:02:13,900
They think too much.
They've memorized how to shoot an arrow.

751
01:02:13,900 --> 01:02:16,300
If you memorized how to walk,
you'd never get across a room.

752
01:02:16,700 --> 01:02:19,500
Why don't you ever look at me?

753
01:02:19,900 --> 01:02:22,300
Huh?

754
01:02:24,700 --> 01:02:29,500
Soon I may be dead,
and you never look at me.

755
01:02:29,500 --> 01:02:33,300
I've changed.
Can you see it?

756
01:02:36,133 --> 01:02:39,333
Deianeira, beauty's not important.

757
01:02:39,333 --> 01:02:41,533
It's your spirit everybody likes.

758
01:02:41,933 --> 01:02:45,767
- You don't think I'm beautiful?
- Sure. That's not what I mean.

759
01:02:47,467 --> 01:02:50,633
Would you ever want to kiss me?

760
01:02:53,833 --> 01:02:56,100
I don't think so.

761
01:02:59,700 --> 01:03:02,133
How about now?

762
01:03:03,733 --> 01:03:06,533
I don't think so.

763
01:03:07,733 --> 01:03:09,733
Now?

764
01:03:11,333 --> 01:03:13,433
No.

765
01:03:15,867 --> 01:03:19,467
Deianeira, wait!

766
01:03:20,700 --> 01:03:23,533
I think...
you're a born leader.

767
01:03:23,533 --> 01:03:25,267
I mean, you're
doing a great job.

768
01:03:25,700 --> 01:03:28,100
Don't make it worse, Hercules.

769
01:03:29,300 --> 01:03:31,300
Quit following me
everywhere I go!

770
01:03:32,900 --> 01:03:34,500
I'm not.

771
01:03:49,300 --> 01:03:52,100
It's a great city, isn't it?

772
01:03:53,300 --> 01:03:54,900
Yes, it is.

773
01:03:55,300 --> 01:03:56,900
And you plan to attack it?

774
01:03:57,300 --> 01:04:00,100
I don't think it's a good idea.

775
01:04:00,100 --> 01:04:02,900
Hera likes the Blue Cult.

776
01:04:02,900 --> 01:04:06,100
- Yeah, she would.
- Can't talk you out of it?

777
01:04:10,100 --> 01:04:12,100
No.

778
01:04:14,500 --> 01:04:17,300
Troy belongs to these people, not Hera.

779
01:04:17,300 --> 01:04:19,700
Why don't you join us?

780
01:04:20,100 --> 01:04:22,900
We'd be side-by-side for once,
fighting for a good cause.

781
01:04:24,500 --> 01:04:30,100
I haven't been in a real war
for... years.

782
01:04:30,500 --> 01:04:35,300
- Still got it in you?
- What a question.

783
01:04:36,900 --> 01:04:39,700
( Laughs )

784
01:04:39,700 --> 01:04:42,100
Of course I have, son.

785
01:04:48,900 --> 01:04:54,100
Did you see that?
That means Zeus himself is on our side!

786
01:04:54,100 --> 01:04:56,900
( Cheering )

787
01:04:56,900 --> 01:05:00,100
- That's a nice shot...
- ( Cheering Continues )

788
01:05:00,500 --> 01:05:02,500
but are you going
to help us or not?

789
01:05:07,700 --> 01:05:09,767
I've got things to do.

790
01:05:14,167 --> 01:05:16,167
I'll lead them myself.

791
01:05:16,167 --> 01:05:18,567
We'll fight our way in
and keep fighting.

792
01:05:18,567 --> 01:05:21,767
- If--
- HERCULES: Good, you're together.

793
01:05:21,767 --> 01:05:23,767
We attack at dawn.

794
01:05:24,167 --> 01:05:26,767
Dawn? Why don't we
attack tonight?

795
01:05:26,767 --> 01:05:28,767
Because we attack at dawn.

796
01:05:29,267 --> 01:05:32,200
The truth is, I didn't think
we could do it before.

797
01:05:32,600 --> 01:05:35,133
I thought I'd just be leading
our people to certain death.

798
01:05:35,633 --> 01:05:39,633
But with the thunderbolt, I know we'll
win because the gods are on our side.

799
01:05:40,033 --> 01:05:42,500
There's not going to be
any more thunderbolts.

800
01:05:42,500 --> 01:05:44,500
But I saw it.

801
01:05:44,500 --> 01:05:47,933
- Zeus is your father. He'll help us.
- Forget about Zeus.

802
01:05:47,933 --> 01:05:50,733
Dawn's in a few hours.

803
01:05:50,733 --> 01:05:53,600
The fighting will be bloody,
so you better be prepared.

804
01:06:39,267 --> 01:06:42,067
DEIANEIRA: I must do something
or they'll all be killed.

805
01:06:45,667 --> 01:06:49,267
Priest, where are you?

806
01:06:49,667 --> 01:06:52,467
I can't let this happen.

807
01:06:56,067 --> 01:07:00,067
Come to me, Deianeira.

808
01:07:00,067 --> 01:07:03,667
Fulfill your true destiny.

809
01:07:03,667 --> 01:07:08,467
Hera will open her arms to you.

810
01:07:36,067 --> 01:07:39,267
Deianeira, it's dawn.
Time to go.

811
01:07:39,267 --> 01:07:41,267
She's not here.

812
01:07:41,667 --> 01:07:44,067
What are you doing here?
Where's Deianeira?

813
01:07:44,067 --> 01:07:47,267
- I thought she was with you.
- That was hours ago.

814
01:07:53,667 --> 01:07:56,467
Waylin, have you seen Deianeira?

815
01:07:56,467 --> 01:07:59,267
She passed me in the middle of the night.
I thought she came back to her hut.

816
01:07:59,667 --> 01:08:01,667
I saw her go into the woods
to ward the city.

817
01:08:02,067 --> 01:08:06,867
Hercules, she must have gone.
And, by the gods, she's gone alone.

818
01:08:06,867 --> 01:08:10,867
- All right, you stay here. I'm going after her myself.
- So am I.

819
01:08:11,267 --> 01:08:13,267
- I'm going as well.
- Me too! Who's game for the attack?

820
01:08:13,267 --> 01:08:15,267
- ( Crowd Yelling )
- Let's get Deianeira and take the city back!

821
01:08:15,267 --> 01:08:19,267
No. No!
There'll be no attack!

822
01:08:19,267 --> 01:08:22,067
- I'm going alone!
- I'm going, and you can't stop me.

823
01:08:22,067 --> 01:08:25,267
But you'll both be killed.
There must be another way.

824
01:08:25,267 --> 01:08:27,267
I refuse to take
the coward's way.

825
01:08:29,267 --> 01:08:31,267
I'm going, not you.

826
01:08:31,267 --> 01:08:33,267
Telamon, just so you know,
I don't need you to tell me...

827
01:08:33,667 --> 01:08:36,067
How there's a hero's way
and a coward's way.

828
01:08:36,067 --> 01:08:38,467
Coward's way.
You're right.

829
01:08:38,467 --> 01:08:40,467
The cowherd's way.
Why didn't I think of it?

830
01:08:40,467 --> 01:08:44,067
- What, now you?
- Not "coward's way." " Cowherd's way. "

831
01:08:44,467 --> 01:08:46,067
I remember before we left the city...

832
01:08:46,467 --> 01:08:48,067
the men who herded the cows didn't like
to use the main gate.

833
01:08:48,467 --> 01:08:51,267
It took too long to get down to the
oasture. They had a shortcut, a tunnel.

834
01:08:51,267 --> 01:08:53,267
- That's right.
- It got them to the pasture quicker.

835
01:08:53,267 --> 01:08:55,267
We called it
the cowherd's way.

836
01:08:55,267 --> 01:08:57,667
- You mean there's a tunnel to the city?
- Yeah.

837
01:08:57,667 --> 01:09:00,067
- Where exactly is this cowherd's way?
- It's down in the brush.

838
01:09:00,067 --> 01:09:03,267
It's all grown over.
Nobody's used it for years.

839
01:09:03,267 --> 01:09:05,667
- Show me.
- Yeah, come on!

840
01:09:11,667 --> 01:09:13,667
Here it is.

841
01:09:22,867 --> 01:09:24,867
MAN: That's it, Hercules.

842
01:09:24,867 --> 01:09:28,067
Remember your training now.
Stay alert.

843
01:09:40,533 --> 01:09:42,267
Shh!

844
01:10:03,933 --> 01:10:06,733
Shh!
Quiet.

845
01:10:22,967 --> 01:10:26,167
WAYLIN: There's nobody here.

846
01:10:26,167 --> 01:10:28,567
Well, what happened?

847
01:10:28,567 --> 01:10:32,967
It's a little run-down
for a big city. It's too quiet.

848
01:10:32,967 --> 01:10:36,167
I don't like ot so quiet. I like
it better when people are talking.

849
01:10:36,567 --> 01:10:38,567
- Waylin!
- Yes, master.

850
01:10:41,767 --> 01:10:45,367
Stay here.
I'm going alone.

851
01:10:45,767 --> 01:10:48,167
- We came to fight.
- Look around you.

852
01:10:48,167 --> 01:10:50,167
The doors were open.
There's nothing to see.

853
01:10:50,167 --> 01:10:52,967
You can't fight
what you can't see.

854
01:10:52,967 --> 01:10:57,767
You're in charge now, Telamon.
Keep them here.

855
01:11:06,967 --> 01:11:10,167
Hercules worries too much.
There's nobody here.

856
01:11:10,567 --> 01:11:12,967
If there were somebody here,
they'd come out, wouldn't they?

857
01:11:12,967 --> 01:11:15,167
Otherwise, what's to stop us
from coming in?

858
01:11:15,167 --> 01:11:18,433
( Gates Rumbling, Latch )

859
01:11:23,633 --> 01:11:27,233
I'm Telamon, warrior of Troy!

860
01:11:28,833 --> 01:11:32,033
Are these empty walls
my only challenge?

861
01:11:36,567 --> 01:11:40,433
( Yelling )

862
01:11:44,867 --> 01:11:49,267
( Monks Yelling )

863
01:11:55,833 --> 01:12:00,300
( Continue Yelling )

864
01:12:08,267 --> 01:12:10,667
Deianeira!

865
01:12:23,467 --> 01:12:25,467
WAYLIN: Telamon, no!

866
01:12:58,267 --> 01:13:00,267
( Gasps, Groans )

867
01:13:01,467 --> 01:13:03,467
Get up, Telamon!
Don't quit!

868
01:13:03,467 --> 01:13:05,467
Waylin, are you crazy?
Telamon's dead!

869
01:13:05,467 --> 01:13:07,467
We'll all be dead
without Hercules!

870
01:13:24,567 --> 01:13:26,400
- ( Monks Chanting )
- Deianeira!

871
01:13:26,867 --> 01:13:29,700
Go away, Hercules.
You'll spoil everything.

872
01:13:49,767 --> 01:13:53,233
Deianeira... come to me.

873
01:14:13,033 --> 01:14:14,833
( Yells )

874
01:14:26,367 --> 01:14:31,333
We don't need Hercules.
I've got Hercules in here.

875
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:43,000
( Woman Shouts )

876
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:47,000
Come on, fish face.
I'm not afraid of you!

877
01:15:03,767 --> 01:15:05,600
Don't be afraid!

878
01:15:05,600 --> 01:15:08,000
If you stand up to them,
they don't exist!

879
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:11,600
( Shouting )

880
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:35,433
Wait! I want to make sure.

881
01:15:35,433 --> 01:15:38,267
If I go through with this,
my people won't be killed...

882
01:15:38,267 --> 01:15:40,267
and they'll get
their city back, right?

883
01:15:40,700 --> 01:15:43,600
You were always meant
to die for Hera.

884
01:15:43,600 --> 01:15:47,733
It's what you were born for.

885
01:15:49,333 --> 01:15:52,533
- But my people--
- ( Thunder Rumbling )

886
01:15:52,533 --> 01:15:55,833
( Rumbling Continues )

887
01:15:55,833 --> 01:16:00,867
Look. Hera is coming for you.
She's all around us.

888
01:16:00,867 --> 01:16:04,867
Feel her power.

889
01:16:04,867 --> 01:16:09,700
( Unsheathes Sword )
This is your destiny.

890
01:16:11,333 --> 01:16:14,767
- Embrace it.
- But I thought--

891
01:16:14,767 --> 01:16:19,267
- It doesn't matter what you thought!
- ( Thunder Rumbling )

892
01:16:19,267 --> 01:16:22,867
- ( Thunder Continues )
- You know, I'm getting tired of this.

893
01:16:22,867 --> 01:16:26,867
- She belongs to Hera. It is her destiny.
- I don't think so.

894
01:16:27,300 --> 01:16:29,300
We'll see.

895
01:16:31,700 --> 01:16:34,500

No more labors for you, Hercules.

( Thunder Rumbling )

902
01:18:01,300 --> 01:18:04,100
I don't think
it would be this easy.

903
01:18:06,233 --> 01:18:09,333
- ( Grunting )
- No!

904
01:18:12,533 --> 01:18:16,533
Stop! If you want me to sacrifice
myself to Hera, I will!

905
01:18:16,533 --> 01:18:20,200
Good. First I'll kill him,
and then I'll kill you.

906
01:18:22,167 --> 01:18:24,533
( Gasps )

907

( Deianeira Whimpering )

912
01:19:00,200 --> 01:19:05,400
Hera, I offer you
this small life.

913
01:19:05,400 --> 01:19:08,233
May it give you pleasure.

914
01:19:08,233 --> 01:19:12,733
( Straining, Whimpering )

915
01:19:26,633 --> 01:19:29,200
( Gasps )

916
01:19:30,467 --> 01:19:34,933
Guess it wasn't so easy
after all, was it?

917
01:19:36,933 --> 01:19:41,733
- ( Thunder Crashing )
- ( Gasping )

918
01:19:41,733 --> 01:19:45,733
Why did you come here?
What did you think you were doing?

919
01:19:46,133 --> 01:19:48,133
I thought it was the only way
I could save my people.

920
01:19:53,400 --> 01:19:56,667
- ( Deianeira Gasps )
- ( Priest Screeches )

( Thunder Rumbling, Crashes )

926
01:20:37,033 --> 01:20:39,833
He said it was my destiny.

927
01:20:39,833 --> 01:20:45,033
You followed your destiny,
and you found it.

928
01:20:45,033 --> 01:20:47,833
But it wasn't
to sacrifice yourself.

929
01:20:47,833 --> 01:20:51,267
It was to follow in your father's
footsteps and lead your people.

930
01:20:51,267 --> 01:20:56,100
- Will you rule them with me?
- You don't need me.

931
01:20:59,000 --> 01:21:04,600
Son... this isn't
what's supposed to happen.

932
01:21:04,600 --> 01:21:09,000
- What are you talking about?
- I can justify your saving the city...

933
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:13,000
but...
Hera wants the girl.

934
01:21:14,200 --> 01:21:16,600
- Why does she get the girl?
- ( Sighs )

935
01:21:16,600 --> 01:21:19,400
You expect me to explain Hera?

936
01:21:19,800 --> 01:21:23,033
( Sighs ) Hera's a goddess.

937
01:21:23,033 --> 01:21:28,233
- ( Thunderclap )
- ( Deianeira Gasping )

938
01:21:33,433 --> 01:21:37,833

941
01:22:01,433 --> 01:22:07,133
Hera, you don't control our destiny!
We find it for ourselves!

942
01:22:22,733 --> 01:22:25,533
Hercules! No!

943
01:22:25,533 --> 01:22:29,933
( Yelling )

944
01:22:36,733 --> 01:22:38,733
He's gone.

945
01:22:39,133 --> 01:22:41,133
She won't hurt him.

946
01:22:41,133 --> 01:22:44,733
She doesn't dare.

947
01:22:45,133 --> 01:22:47,533
- But I love him.
- So do I.

948
01:22:47,533 --> 01:22:51,933
But his work is done here,
and he has to move on.

949
01:22:51,933 --> 01:22:53,933
I'll never forget Hercules.

950
01:22:54,333 --> 01:22:58,733
Don't forget what
he told you about the gods.

951
01:22:58,733 --> 01:23:01,933
They are jealous and petty.

952
01:23:01,933 --> 01:23:07,233
Now... listen.

953
01:23:08,500 --> 01:23:11,733
You must follow your own destiny.

954
01:23:11,733 --> 01:23:14,133
You are his father, aren't you?

955
01:23:14,133 --> 01:23:18,933
You see the resemblance?
( Laughs )

956
01:23:19,333 --> 01:23:22,900
No, no, no, no.
He looks like his mother.

957
01:23:22,900 --> 01:23:28,167
She's only mortal,
but she's exquisite.

958
01:23:29,367 --> 01:23:32,633
Well, I have to go,
and you've got things to do.

You're alive. ( Sighs )

963
01:24:22,667 --> 01:24:24,667
Hercules saved you
when I couldn't.

964
01:24:24,667 --> 01:24:28,267
- You're hurt.
- It's nothing.

965
01:24:28,267 --> 01:24:30,667
The people are waiting for you.

966
01:24:30,667 --> 01:24:34,767
The city is truly ours
once more.

967
01:24:38,767 --> 01:24:41,567
We're home, Deianeira.
Thank you.

968
01:24:41,567 --> 01:24:43,967
You were very brave.

969
01:24:43,967 --> 01:24:45,967
Deianeira, did you see us fight?

970
01:24:46,367 --> 01:24:48,767
We were superb.
You father would have been proud.

971
01:24:48,767 --> 01:24:50,767
Yes, he would have.

972
01:24:50,767 --> 01:24:53,567
Princess, I know Hercules
ordered us not to attack...

973
01:24:53,967 --> 01:24:56,767
but after Telamon got wounded,
I ordered myself to attack.

974
01:24:56,767 --> 01:24:59,167
And being a good slave,
I obeyed without hesitation.

975
01:24:59,167 --> 01:25:01,567
- Waylin, you're free.
- I think I showed--

976
01:25:01,567 --> 01:25:04,367
Now you can work
for the cause of Troy.

977
01:25:04,367 --> 01:25:07,167
I appoint you Minister of Defense.

978
01:25:10,667 --> 01:25:13,533
Minister of Defense.

979
01:25:13,533 --> 01:25:15,533

WOMAN: We must build him a shrine!

982
01:25:25,133 --> 01:25:28,733
- MAN: Yes, a shrine for Hercules!
- No shrines.

983
01:25:28,733 --> 01:25:31,133
He wouldn't want that.

984
01:25:31,133 --> 01:25:33,533
Hercules' labor is done here.

985
01:25:33,533 --> 01:25:35,533
I know that wherever he is...

986
01:25:35,533 --> 01:25:37,933
he would want us to look
to ourselves now...

987
01:25:37,933 --> 01:25:40,333
to believe in ourselves...

988
01:25:40,733 --> 01:25:43,533
and always to remember him.

989
01:25:50,733 --> 01:25:53,133

Well, they said you cam his way.

996
01:26:40,333 --> 01:26:42,333
You've got to help us.

997
01:26:42,333 --> 01:26:45,933
- There's a monster, a fire-breather.
- A fire-breather?

998
01:26:45,933 --> 01:26:49,933
Yeah, and we've sacrificed
everything we have.

999
01:26:49,933 --> 01:26:52,333
Sacrifices don't work.

I'll see what I can do.
