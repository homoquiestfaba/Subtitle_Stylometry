1
00:04:28,635 --> 00:04:31,637
Today, the boy is dead.

2
00:04:31,639 --> 00:04:33,538
And in his place...

3
00:04:39,445 --> 00:04:41,313
Is a man.

4
00:05:44,777 --> 00:05:46,244
Here you go.

5
00:05:48,948 --> 00:05:51,717
Training in 60 minutes.

6
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:54,953
Hurry up!

7
00:07:18,871 --> 00:07:21,773
Where's the boning knife?

8
00:07:21,775 --> 00:07:26,645
Dad? Zaja took
the boning knife again.

9
00:07:38,257 --> 00:07:40,058
Oh, yeah.

10
00:07:45,398 --> 00:07:47,032
Jesus.

11
00:07:50,102 --> 00:07:53,305
- Pol pot.
- Yeah.

12
00:07:53,307 --> 00:07:55,073
Boning knife.

13
00:07:57,510 --> 00:07:59,878
- Mountain beaver, huh?
- Mm-hmm.

14
00:08:19,198 --> 00:08:21,600
You're dead.

15
00:08:21,602 --> 00:08:24,069
Vespyr, Kielyr, pair off.

16
00:08:25,371 --> 00:08:26,938
Get your guard up.

17
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:28,940
You have to stab to kill.

18
00:08:28,942 --> 00:08:30,842
Aim for the liver
or the kidneys.

19
00:08:30,844 --> 00:08:32,544
Otherwise, she'll never learn.

20
00:08:32,546 --> 00:08:35,647
Shouldn't we aim here? A knife in
the lungs creates a pneumothorax.

21
00:08:35,649 --> 00:08:38,183
Or next to the sternum,
penetrate the heart?

22
00:08:38,185 --> 00:08:40,318
That'd be instant death.

23
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:43,188
If it makes you happy, Zaj,
sure, aim for the heart.

24
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:45,524
- Bo, you want to show 'em?
- Over here.

25
00:08:45,526 --> 00:08:47,492
Okay, let's go.

26
00:08:47,494 --> 00:08:49,027
Disarm her if you can.

27
00:08:55,301 --> 00:08:57,536
- Ow!
- Good.

28
00:08:57,538 --> 00:09:01,573
How is that good? She just stabbed me.
She fucking just stabbed me.

29
00:09:01,575 --> 00:09:04,376
Well, then learn
to defend yourself.

30
00:09:04,378 --> 00:09:06,077
You kill her.
Yeah, thank you.

31
00:09:06,079 --> 00:09:08,179
Let's try that.

32
00:09:08,181 --> 00:09:10,649
Okay. This is
where she goes...

33
00:09:42,081 --> 00:09:44,082
Zaj, page.

34
00:09:44,917 --> 00:09:47,385
398.

35
00:09:47,387 --> 00:09:49,921
You still liking it?
Mm-hmm.

36
00:09:49,923 --> 00:09:53,725
To stay on schedule for the test, you're
gonna have to be finished in eight days.

37
00:09:53,727 --> 00:09:55,126
Okay?

38
00:09:55,128 --> 00:09:56,628
Okay.

39
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:02,100
Vesp?
How you getting along?

40
00:10:02,102 --> 00:10:05,704
I just finished chapter 12,
"the world on a string."

41
00:10:08,808 --> 00:10:10,875
What?

42
00:10:10,877 --> 00:10:14,045
Are you having any trouble
with quantum entanglement?

43
00:10:14,047 --> 00:10:16,047
Planck length
versus Planck time?

44
00:10:17,783 --> 00:10:20,418
I'm fine.
Good.

45
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:23,588
Then tomorrow after lunch, you can
give a brief presentation on m-theory.

46
00:10:23,590 --> 00:10:27,058
Argue counterpoints with Bo and
Rell vis-a-vis Witten and Dirac.

47
00:12:53,807 --> 00:12:56,107
Whoo-hoo!

48
00:13:00,913 --> 00:13:02,380
<i>Whoo-hoo!</i>

49
00:13:07,052 --> 00:13:10,021
Go. Go all the way
to the top. Go!

50
00:13:12,825 --> 00:13:15,927
<i>Whoo-hoo!
Ah-ah!</i>

51
00:13:17,831 --> 00:13:20,965
If training is over today, can we
take Steve somewhere for class later?

52
00:13:20,967 --> 00:13:23,668
Maybe. Why does mommy
have to be gone so long?

53
00:13:26,772 --> 00:13:28,606
She hasn't been gone very long.

54
00:13:28,608 --> 00:13:32,677
Actually, it's been three months,
two weeks, six days and 11 hours.

55
00:13:32,679 --> 00:13:35,780
- Mom is very ill. -Don't talk to
us like we're your inferiors.

56
00:13:35,782 --> 00:13:38,349
Bo is right. Mom needs to be
in the hospital right now.

57
00:13:38,351 --> 00:13:42,420
You said hospitals are a great place to go if
you're a healthy person and you want to die.

58
00:13:42,422 --> 00:13:45,456
You said Americans are
undereducated and overmedicated.

59
00:13:45,458 --> 00:13:47,458
You said the ama
are avaricious whores

60
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:49,694
only too willing to spread
their fat legs for big pharma.

61
00:13:49,696 --> 00:13:51,863
All those things are true.

62
00:13:51,865 --> 00:13:54,866
But mom does not have enough of
the neurotransmitter serotonin

63
00:13:54,868 --> 00:13:57,035
to conduct electrical
signals in her brain.

64
00:13:57,037 --> 00:13:58,937
Exactly when is mom coming back?

65
00:14:01,273 --> 00:14:03,107
That's what I'm
gonna go find out.

66
00:14:04,710 --> 00:14:06,177
Be good, monkey butts.

67
00:14:06,179 --> 00:14:07,645
- See you later, dad.
- Bye.

68
00:14:07,647 --> 00:14:08,947
Bye, guys.

69
00:14:53,525 --> 00:14:54,959
Sorry.

70
00:14:56,729 --> 00:14:59,297
Are you coming in?

71
00:15:02,501 --> 00:15:04,235
No? Okay. Bye.

72
00:15:11,077 --> 00:15:15,680
Here, Bo, I got that.
Go talk to 'em. We got time.

73
00:15:15,682 --> 00:15:19,250
Ask her what she thinks of the working
people creating an armed revolution

74
00:15:19,252 --> 00:15:22,020
against the exploiting classes
and their state structures?

75
00:15:22,022 --> 00:15:24,522
Well, Marxists can be just
as genocidal as capitalists.

76
00:15:24,524 --> 00:15:26,524
Or whether or not she's
a dialectical materialist

77
00:15:26,526 --> 00:15:28,693
and accords primacy
to the class struggle?

78
00:15:28,695 --> 00:15:31,429
Avoid Marxism. Or telling
her you're a Trotskyite.

79
00:15:31,431 --> 00:15:33,398
Trotskyist.

80
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:35,967
Only a Stalinist would call
a Trotskyist a Trotskyite.

81
00:15:35,969 --> 00:15:37,869
And I'm not
a Trotskyist anymore.

82
00:15:37,871 --> 00:15:39,337
I'm a Maoist.

83
00:15:40,973 --> 00:15:43,741
- Right.

84
00:15:43,743 --> 00:15:45,810
I forgot. Sorry.

85
00:15:48,213 --> 00:15:51,783
- Hey.
- Hey, Joe.

86
00:15:51,785 --> 00:15:53,952
I sold all your stuff from last time.
Great.

87
00:15:53,954 --> 00:15:55,887
Let's see what you got.

88
00:16:38,197 --> 00:16:40,264
<i>Hello?</i>
Hey.

89
00:16:40,266 --> 00:16:42,467
<i>Ben.</i>
How's she doing?

90
00:16:49,776 --> 00:16:52,043
Harper?

91
00:16:53,479 --> 00:16:55,613
Harper.

92
00:16:55,615 --> 00:16:57,248
<i>Leslie killed herself
last night.</i>

93
00:17:04,223 --> 00:17:05,723
How?

94
00:17:07,693 --> 00:17:12,096
Harper? Harper.
Tell me.

95
00:17:16,235 --> 00:17:18,102
<i>She slit her wrists.</i>

96
00:17:22,642 --> 00:17:25,476
<i>You're my brother. If you need
anything from me, I am right...</i>

97
00:18:21,433 --> 00:18:22,867
Last night,

98
00:18:24,369 --> 00:18:27,371
mommy killed herself.

99
00:18:29,141 --> 00:18:30,942
She finally did it.

100
00:18:36,649 --> 00:18:38,716
Your mother is dead.

101
00:18:47,392 --> 00:18:49,660
Nothing is going to change.

102
00:18:52,431 --> 00:18:55,299
We will go on living
in exactly the same way.

103
00:18:58,505 --> 00:19:00,471
We're a family.

104
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:02,940
Mom!

105
00:19:14,119 --> 00:19:15,353
Fuck you!

106
00:19:23,328 --> 00:19:27,865
Mom! Mom! Fuck you!

107
00:19:27,867 --> 00:19:31,302
Fucking... no!

108
00:19:31,304 --> 00:19:34,172
Mom! I hate you!

109
00:19:34,174 --> 00:19:35,673
Fuck!

110
00:19:58,730 --> 00:20:00,231
Daddy.

111
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,301
Jesus fucking Christ.

112
00:21:09,234 --> 00:21:12,236
Forty-three.
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go!

113
00:21:12,238 --> 00:21:15,206
Forty-four. Forty-five.

114
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:20,811
Hold plank.

115
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:24,315
Like boards.

116
00:21:24,317 --> 00:21:27,151
Breathe, breathe, breathe.
You got it.

117
00:21:29,221 --> 00:21:32,156
Keep holding. You're strong.
You can do it.

118
00:21:33,992 --> 00:21:36,527
Dad, when's mom's funeral?

119
00:21:40,132 --> 00:21:43,768
<i>The utter recklessness,
the instability and insecurity</i>

120
00:21:43,770 --> 00:21:45,469
<i>that you have brought
to her life...</i>

121
00:21:45,471 --> 00:21:47,738
We decided to live here.
Both of us.

122
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:49,640
<i>This is your fault.</i>

123
00:21:51,276 --> 00:21:54,111
Leslie had a disease. She had
to be in a good facility.

124
00:21:54,113 --> 00:21:58,249
You were kind enough to offer to pay for
it as long as she was treated near you.

125
00:21:58,251 --> 00:22:00,651
We did that.
I found her will.

126
00:22:00,653 --> 00:22:03,587
I-I assume you know
that Leslie was a Buddhist.

127
00:22:03,589 --> 00:22:07,525
That means she wanted
to be cremated, not buried.

128
00:22:07,527 --> 00:22:09,126
It was very important to her...

129
00:22:09,128 --> 00:22:11,128
<i>I have just lost my only child.</i>

130
00:22:11,130 --> 00:22:14,498
<i>I'm in no mood to discuss the
particulars of her funeral with you.</i>

131
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:16,534
<i>Wherever you are, stay there!</i>

132
00:22:16,536 --> 00:22:18,502
<i>You are not welcome here.</i>

133
00:22:18,504 --> 00:22:21,105
<i>If you show up, I will
have you arrested.</i> Can...

134
00:22:22,474 --> 00:22:24,608
Jack?

135
00:22:24,610 --> 00:22:27,378
- Goddamn it.
<i>- Hello, Ben.</i>

136
00:22:27,380 --> 00:22:30,781
<i>Leslie is in heaven now.
She is finally at peace.</i>

137
00:22:30,783 --> 00:22:33,884
When is the ceremony?

138
00:22:33,886 --> 00:22:38,289
<i>It's in five days
in new Mexico, at our church.</i>

139
00:22:38,291 --> 00:22:41,292
<i>How are the children?</i> Did you
hear what Jack just said?

140
00:22:41,294 --> 00:22:46,130
<i>It's been years.</i> He said that he would
have me arrested if we go there.

141
00:22:46,132 --> 00:22:48,899
Did you hear that?
<i>He's very upset.</i>

142
00:22:50,635 --> 00:22:52,903
<i>It's just best
to do what he says.</i>

143
00:23:01,146 --> 00:23:04,582
It doesn't make any sense. I mean, who
are they to make these decisions?

144
00:23:04,584 --> 00:23:07,852
It's this sick sense of entitlement
that they all seem to have.

145
00:23:07,854 --> 00:23:10,921
This is what we stand against. This is what
mom stood against. Mom hated that world.

146
00:23:10,923 --> 00:23:12,957
Clothes on when we eat, please.

147
00:23:19,064 --> 00:23:21,532
- It's completely unjust.
- That's what it is.

148
00:23:21,534 --> 00:23:23,868
We're in the very unique
position of hating those people.

149
00:23:23,870 --> 00:23:26,003
- Can unique be modified?
- No.

150
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:34,211
We don't hate Nana and grandpa, but the rest
of their tribe are fascist capitalists.

151
00:23:34,213 --> 00:23:36,213
You're just repeating
whatever dad says.

152
00:23:36,215 --> 00:23:38,849
I'm writing down
everything you say.

153
00:23:38,851 --> 00:23:41,552
In my mind.

154
00:23:41,554 --> 00:23:43,521
Do you even know
what a fascist is?

155
00:23:43,523 --> 00:23:46,056
Violent nationalist militants,

156
00:23:46,058 --> 00:23:47,892
supported by big business,

157
00:23:47,894 --> 00:23:50,027
and they're totalitarian
single-party dictators.

158
00:23:52,798 --> 00:23:55,132
We're her family.
We have to go.

159
00:23:55,134 --> 00:23:57,034
Grandpa said we can't.

160
00:23:59,371 --> 00:24:00,971
What will happen
if they arrest you?

161
00:24:05,377 --> 00:24:07,044
Will they take us away from you?

162
00:24:13,385 --> 00:24:15,920
That's a possibility.

163
00:24:30,669 --> 00:24:32,369
Hey.

164
00:24:33,672 --> 00:24:35,172
Wake up.

165
00:24:37,642 --> 00:24:40,478
Wake up, grizzly bear,

166
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:42,813
my fantastic man.

167
00:24:54,459 --> 00:24:56,827
What we're doing out here
is so incredible.

168
00:24:58,930 --> 00:25:00,498
The kids are amazing.

169
00:25:04,536 --> 00:25:07,905
But you have to take care
of them for me, okay?

170
00:25:12,210 --> 00:25:14,278
I love you all so much.

171
00:25:17,315 --> 00:25:19,250
I love you so much.

172
00:25:44,509 --> 00:25:46,577
We want to see mom.

173
00:25:46,579 --> 00:25:48,078
Plus, grandpa can't oppress us.

174
00:25:49,648 --> 00:25:53,217
- We want to honor her life.
- It's the least you could do.

175
00:25:53,219 --> 00:25:55,386
What's that supposed to mean?

176
00:25:56,588 --> 00:25:58,122
You know.

177
00:25:59,524 --> 00:26:01,659
No, I don't.

178
00:26:02,661 --> 00:26:05,396
Forget it.
But I know.

179
00:26:05,398 --> 00:26:08,599
We're strong and we're ready.
I said no.

180
00:26:08,601 --> 00:26:10,334
It's too risky.

181
00:26:10,336 --> 00:26:12,169
We're defined by our actions,
not our words.

182
00:26:12,171 --> 00:26:16,073
- Dad, give us the mission.
- Mission: Rescue mom!

183
00:26:16,075 --> 00:26:17,942
Training in 10 minutes.

184
00:26:46,771 --> 00:26:49,106
Oh, fuck!

185
00:26:49,108 --> 00:26:50,874
Rell?

186
00:26:50,876 --> 00:26:52,610
Can you flex your fingers?

187
00:26:53,378 --> 00:26:55,913
S-t-o-p.

188
00:26:55,915 --> 00:27:01,051
Stay calm,
think, observe and plan.

189
00:27:01,053 --> 00:27:04,488
If you hit the rocks below you,
you'll die from blunt force trauma.

190
00:27:05,924 --> 00:27:09,760
Or internal bleeding
from massive bone fracturing.

191
00:27:09,762 --> 00:27:11,996
Or splenic flexure
of the large intestine.

192
00:27:11,998 --> 00:27:14,665
Yes, thank you, Zaj.

193
00:27:14,667 --> 00:27:16,800
I can't. My hand.

194
00:27:16,802 --> 00:27:19,336
There's no cavalry.

195
00:27:19,338 --> 00:27:22,506
No one will magically appear
and save you in the end.

196
00:27:34,653 --> 00:27:36,687
Almost.

197
00:27:38,357 --> 00:27:40,190
You got it.
Good boy.

198
00:27:41,493 --> 00:27:43,027
All right, let's go.

199
00:28:26,304 --> 00:28:28,806
Class time on Steve. We're
going up to the glacier.

200
00:28:29,908 --> 00:28:31,408
Let's go.

201
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:10,914
We can't go to mommy's funeral.

202
00:29:10,916 --> 00:29:12,483
We have to do what we're told.

203
00:29:14,185 --> 00:29:18,122
Some fights you can't win.

204
00:29:18,124 --> 00:29:20,524
The powerful control
the lives of the powerless.

205
00:29:22,093 --> 00:29:24,695
That's the way the world works.

206
00:29:24,697 --> 00:29:26,964
It's unjust and it's unfair.

207
00:29:26,966 --> 00:29:30,367
But that's just too damn bad.

208
00:29:30,369 --> 00:29:34,204
We have to shut up
and accept it.

209
00:29:45,984 --> 00:29:47,451
Well, fuck that.

210
00:29:56,829 --> 00:30:00,230
- So they know we're coming.

211
00:30:04,803 --> 00:30:08,138
Mommy! Mommy! Mommy! Mommy!

212
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:10,340
Mommy!
Whoo!

213
00:30:51,616 --> 00:30:53,784
Attention, all campers.

214
00:30:53,786 --> 00:30:55,786
This is your captain speaking.

215
00:30:55,788 --> 00:30:58,889
Here we have the embodiment
of Calvin Coolidge's statement

216
00:30:58,891 --> 00:31:01,625
that the business of America
is business.

217
00:31:01,627 --> 00:31:05,562
Our democracy is one of the
brightest lights of social justice

218
00:31:05,564 --> 00:31:07,464
in the history of humankind,

219
00:31:07,466 --> 00:31:10,734
and yet most of
our fellow citizens engage

220
00:31:10,736 --> 00:31:14,238
in frenzied shopping as their
primary form of social interaction.

221
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:16,974
Come on down!
Let's go shopping!

222
00:31:16,976 --> 00:31:20,010
These prices are insane!

223
00:31:38,930 --> 00:31:41,031
- What's a bordello?
- A whorehouse.

224
00:31:41,033 --> 00:31:42,432
Oh.
What are you reading?

225
00:31:44,535 --> 00:31:47,271
<i>Lolita?</i>
I didn't assign that book.

226
00:31:47,273 --> 00:31:49,172
I'm skipping ahead.

227
00:31:50,341 --> 00:31:51,842
And?

228
00:31:54,045 --> 00:31:56,046
- It's interesting.
- Interesting!

229
00:31:56,048 --> 00:31:58,916
- Illegal word!
- Dad, Kielyr said "interesting"!

230
00:31:58,918 --> 00:32:01,618
Interesting is a non-word. You
know you're supposed to avoid it.

231
00:32:01,620 --> 00:32:04,621
- Be specific.
- It's disturbing.

232
00:32:04,623 --> 00:32:06,723
More specific.
Can I just read?

233
00:32:06,725 --> 00:32:09,426
After you give us
your analysis thus far.

234
00:32:09,428 --> 00:32:13,397
There's this old man
who loves this girl,

235
00:32:13,399 --> 00:32:15,799
and she's only 12 years
old... that's the plot.

236
00:32:24,409 --> 00:32:27,744
Because it's written
from his perspective,

237
00:32:27,746 --> 00:32:31,415
you sort of understand
and sympathize with him,

238
00:32:31,417 --> 00:32:37,254
which is kind of amazing because
he's essentially a child molester.

239
00:32:37,256 --> 00:32:42,259
But his love for her
is beautiful.

240
00:32:42,261 --> 00:32:46,563
But it's also sort of a trick
because it's so wrong.

241
00:32:46,565 --> 00:32:51,568
You know, he's old,
and he basically rapes her.

242
00:32:51,570 --> 00:32:54,338
So it makes me feel...

243
00:32:57,175 --> 00:32:59,810
I hate him.

244
00:32:59,812 --> 00:33:02,579
And somehow I feel sorry
for him at the same time.

245
00:33:04,148 --> 00:33:05,649
Well done.

246
00:33:08,853 --> 00:33:11,054
What does rape mean?

247
00:33:13,491 --> 00:33:15,792
When a person, usually a man,

248
00:33:15,794 --> 00:33:18,028
forces another person,
usually a woman,

249
00:33:18,030 --> 00:33:20,330
to have sexual intercourse.

250
00:33:20,332 --> 00:33:22,099
- Oh.
- Who's hungry?

251
00:33:22,101 --> 00:33:24,534
Me! Me!

252
00:33:24,536 --> 00:33:28,105
What's sexual intercourse?

253
00:33:30,174 --> 00:33:34,111
When a man sticks his penis
in a woman's vagina.

254
00:33:34,113 --> 00:33:37,014
Everyone keep their eyes
peeled for deer.

255
00:33:37,016 --> 00:33:40,450
Why would a man stick his penis
in a woman's vagina?

256
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:45,355
Because it can
give them both pleasure.

257
00:33:45,357 --> 00:33:48,692
And because the combination of a
man's sperm and a woman's egg

258
00:33:48,694 --> 00:33:51,528
can create a baby
and continue the human race.

259
00:33:51,530 --> 00:33:54,398
But that's where she pees.

260
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:58,335
Pee comes not from the vagina,
but from the urethra,

261
00:33:58,337 --> 00:34:00,804
which is within the outer labia.

262
00:34:00,806 --> 00:34:04,975
But generally speaking,
yes, that is where she pees.

263
00:34:04,977 --> 00:34:08,045
Everyone keep your eyes open
for game of any kind.

264
00:34:42,346 --> 00:34:43,847
Okay.

265
00:34:47,418 --> 00:34:49,453
Now what?

266
00:34:49,455 --> 00:34:52,389
- What's wrong with everyone?
- Are they sick?

267
00:34:52,391 --> 00:34:54,458
- What do you mean?
- Everyone's so fat.

268
00:34:56,527 --> 00:34:59,229
- Yeah, they are.
- Fat like hippos.

269
00:34:59,231 --> 00:35:02,632
- That's not nice to say.
- But look!

270
00:35:05,136 --> 00:35:08,271
Okay, you can think that,
but we don't make fun of people.

271
00:35:08,273 --> 00:35:10,073
Right, dad?
That's right.

272
00:35:10,075 --> 00:35:12,976
- We don't make fun of people.
- Except Christians.

273
00:35:26,959 --> 00:35:28,959
Dad?

274
00:35:28,961 --> 00:35:30,460
Dad?

275
00:35:33,164 --> 00:35:34,798
Shit.

276
00:35:43,107 --> 00:35:45,842
This, right now...

277
00:35:45,844 --> 00:35:48,178
This is your first real test.

278
00:35:48,180 --> 00:35:51,348
Stay calm.
Remember your training.

279
00:35:55,453 --> 00:35:57,187
Morning.
How you doing today?

280
00:35:57,189 --> 00:36:00,157
Morning, officer. Can I see your
license and registration, please?

281
00:36:00,159 --> 00:36:01,825
Certainly.

282
00:36:03,261 --> 00:36:06,296
- Nice rig.
- Thank you.

283
00:36:06,298 --> 00:36:09,266
I pulled you over because your
back left taillight is out.

284
00:36:09,268 --> 00:36:11,368
- Did you know that?
- No, I didn't.

285
00:36:11,370 --> 00:36:13,003
I'm sorry.

286
00:36:13,005 --> 00:36:14,938
I'll be right back.

287
00:36:20,311 --> 00:36:22,112
No school today?

288
00:36:22,947 --> 00:36:24,414
Not yet.

289
00:36:39,864 --> 00:36:43,133
Man, by his sin,
has become separated from god,

290
00:36:43,135 --> 00:36:46,069
and only through personally accepting
the gift of reconciliation

291
00:36:46,071 --> 00:36:47,971
purchased by Jesus on the cross

292
00:36:47,973 --> 00:36:50,640
can he regain
his fellowship with god.

293
00:36:50,642 --> 00:36:52,709
We're home-schooled.
Father, may I?

294
00:36:54,378 --> 00:36:56,179
You may.

295
00:37:20,772 --> 00:37:23,073
Seriously, uh... look...

296
00:37:25,110 --> 00:37:28,211
I gotta get back to work. When you get
a minute, fix that taillight, okay?

297
00:37:28,213 --> 00:37:30,914
- I'll do it right away, sir.
- Have a good day, guys.

298
00:37:30,916 --> 00:37:33,650
- God bless.
- God bless!

299
00:37:35,853 --> 00:37:37,754
Power to the people.

300
00:37:37,756 --> 00:37:40,190
Stick it to the man.

301
00:38:21,565 --> 00:38:23,400
They're just standing there.

302
00:38:42,853 --> 00:38:44,354
I miss mom.

303
00:39:09,380 --> 00:39:12,048
Hey.

304
00:39:15,554 --> 00:39:19,289
No. No Esperanto.
I'm not joking.

305
00:39:21,860 --> 00:39:25,295
No foreign language unless the
language is spoken by all.

306
00:39:25,297 --> 00:39:28,365
You know the rule.

307
00:39:37,209 --> 00:39:39,075
No Esperanto!

308
00:39:40,378 --> 00:39:42,979
- Please.
- I'm hungry.

309
00:39:42,981 --> 00:39:45,982
Well, then maybe one of you should
have shot the fucking sheep.

310
00:39:56,761 --> 00:39:58,595
They have hot dogs!

311
00:39:59,997 --> 00:40:01,765
What's cola?

312
00:40:01,767 --> 00:40:03,366
Poison water.

313
00:40:03,368 --> 00:40:05,835
- Can I have the grilled cheese?
- No.

314
00:40:05,837 --> 00:40:09,406
What's a milk shake? Dad, can
I have a hamburger and fries?

315
00:40:09,408 --> 00:40:11,708
Can I have pancakes?

316
00:40:11,710 --> 00:40:14,677
Okay, everyone up.
We're outta here.

317
00:40:14,679 --> 00:40:18,281
- What? No, why? -'Cause there's
no actual food on this menu.

318
00:40:18,283 --> 00:40:20,250
Let's go.

319
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:25,148
Are you okay?

320
00:41:25,150 --> 00:41:29,018
An old man's having a heart attack!
Call 911!

321
00:41:29,020 --> 00:41:30,854
Call 911!

322
00:41:30,856 --> 00:41:33,623
Everyone, get back!

323
00:41:33,625 --> 00:41:35,024
My pills!

324
00:42:00,217 --> 00:42:02,352
I'm okay.
He's okay now.

325
00:42:02,354 --> 00:42:04,687
- Sir?
- Sorry.

326
00:42:05,656 --> 00:42:07,557
Sir?

327
00:42:07,559 --> 00:42:09,459
Sir!

328
00:42:09,461 --> 00:42:11,961
- Sir?
- Sorry about the fuss.

329
00:42:11,963 --> 00:42:14,330
You sure we can't get you
an ambulance or anything?

330
00:42:14,332 --> 00:42:16,566
No, I just forgot
to take my pills.

331
00:42:16,568 --> 00:42:18,468
I'm fine now, really.

332
00:42:38,657 --> 00:42:40,723
Where else can we improve?

333
00:42:40,725 --> 00:42:43,493
Flawed exit strategy. Everyone
went out the same doors.

334
00:42:43,495 --> 00:42:45,562
No one utilized the
loading dock area at all.

335
00:42:45,564 --> 00:42:47,764
If it got blocked, we'd
all be trapped. Mm-hmm.

336
00:42:47,766 --> 00:42:49,666
Inadequately planned
extraction point.

337
00:42:49,668 --> 00:42:51,868
We probably shouldn't have all
gone directly to the bus.

338
00:42:51,870 --> 00:42:54,337
Predetermined pickups would
have been much less risky.

339
00:42:54,339 --> 00:42:56,906
On the plus side, mission:
Free the food accomplished.

340
00:42:56,908 --> 00:42:59,442
Mission: Free the food!
Top marks all around.

341
00:42:59,444 --> 00:43:02,011
Now, if you'd all do me a
favor and close your eyes.

342
00:43:06,383 --> 00:43:08,685
You may open your eyes.

343
00:43:09,687 --> 00:43:11,054
Happy Noam Chomsky day.

344
00:43:11,056 --> 00:43:13,523
But Noam was born on December 7.

345
00:43:13,525 --> 00:43:14,958
Well, we're
celebrating it today.

346
00:43:24,768 --> 00:43:26,569
Oh. Mmm!

347
00:43:26,571 --> 00:43:28,705
Yum.

348
00:43:28,707 --> 00:43:30,506
It's so good.

349
00:43:57,802 --> 00:43:59,802
All hail!

350
00:44:01,172 --> 00:44:03,806
- Here we go. Nai.
- Yes.

351
00:44:03,808 --> 00:44:05,241
- Bodevan.
- Thank you.

352
00:44:05,243 --> 00:44:07,410
Rellian.

353
00:44:08,779 --> 00:44:09,779
Rell.

354
00:44:09,781 --> 00:44:12,582
Kielyr, Vespyr, Zaja.

355
00:44:12,584 --> 00:44:14,751
All right, go for it.

356
00:44:14,753 --> 00:44:16,686
Dad!

357
00:44:16,688 --> 00:44:19,589
Fifty-five pound pull,
laminated wood and glass.

358
00:44:19,591 --> 00:44:21,357
Whoa!

359
00:44:21,359 --> 00:44:23,259
A ka-bar
fighting knife?

360
00:44:23,261 --> 00:44:24,861
That's right.
Thanks, dad!

361
00:44:24,863 --> 00:44:26,963
It's so beautiful.

362
00:44:26,965 --> 00:44:30,600
Seven-inch blade, partially serrated,
well-balanced if you dip when you cut.

363
00:44:31,869 --> 00:44:34,137
Pictures.

364
00:44:34,139 --> 00:44:36,706
Oh.

365
00:44:36,708 --> 00:44:38,508
Those are black storm broadheads.
Razor sharp.

366
00:44:42,179 --> 00:44:45,281
What kind of crazy person
celebrates Noam Chomsky's birthday

367
00:44:45,283 --> 00:44:47,650
like it's some kind
of official holiday?

368
00:44:47,652 --> 00:44:50,787
Why can't we celebrate Christmas
like the rest of the entire world?

369
00:44:50,789 --> 00:44:54,390
You would prefer to celebrate
a magical fictitious elf

370
00:44:54,392 --> 00:44:56,659
instead of a living humanitarian

371
00:44:56,661 --> 00:45:00,663
who's done so much to promote
human rights and understanding?

372
00:45:00,665 --> 00:45:03,533
Okay, well,
let's have a discourse.

373
00:45:05,869 --> 00:45:08,871
Forget it.
No, explain.

374
00:45:08,873 --> 00:45:11,474
Take the opportunity
to make your case.

375
00:45:11,476 --> 00:45:13,142
We're all open
to hearing your arguments.

376
00:45:13,144 --> 00:45:15,311
If they're valid
and you persuade us,

377
00:45:15,313 --> 00:45:18,214
I'm sure we'd all be willing
to change our minds.

378
00:45:18,216 --> 00:45:19,716
Right?
Yeah.

379
00:45:19,718 --> 00:45:21,317
Use your words.

380
00:45:49,913 --> 00:45:51,981
Ah!

381
00:45:54,084 --> 00:45:55,251
Yes!

382
00:45:55,253 --> 00:45:57,420
Thanks, dad!
You're welcome.

383
00:46:25,249 --> 00:46:27,083
You guys need a hand?

384
00:46:27,085 --> 00:46:29,051
- No, we're fine.
- No, we got it.

385
00:46:31,488 --> 00:46:33,923
- All right.
- Jackson, not at the table.

386
00:46:33,925 --> 00:46:35,458
- Hey.
- Jackson.

387
00:46:35,460 --> 00:46:38,494
All right.

388
00:46:38,496 --> 00:46:44,400
Well, I am so happy
that our family is together.

389
00:46:44,402 --> 00:46:46,769
Thanks for putting on
this feast.

390
00:46:46,771 --> 00:46:51,340
It's all local and, um,
organic and non-gmo, so...

391
00:46:51,342 --> 00:46:52,842
How did you kill those chickens?

392
00:46:52,844 --> 00:46:54,911
With an ax or a knife?

393
00:46:58,015 --> 00:47:01,484
I... I didn't have to
kill the chickens.

394
00:47:01,486 --> 00:47:04,086
I... they, uh... i...

395
00:47:04,088 --> 00:47:06,756
It's a rotisserie chicken,
so you buy it on...

396
00:47:06,758 --> 00:47:08,658
It's already dead.
Or cooked.

397
00:47:08,660 --> 00:47:11,093
On a thing.

398
00:47:14,165 --> 00:47:16,265
- Dig in.
- All right.

399
00:47:18,502 --> 00:47:21,003
- Ben, some wine?
- Please.

400
00:47:24,708 --> 00:47:27,143
Dad, can I have some wine?

401
00:47:27,145 --> 00:47:30,179
- Sure. Why not?
- -Ben. No.

402
00:47:30,181 --> 00:47:32,448
Children don't drink wine.

403
00:47:32,450 --> 00:47:35,785
In France and other countries, children
drink small amounts of wine all the time.

404
00:47:35,787 --> 00:47:38,054
It's a digestive.
It's not crack.

405
00:47:38,056 --> 00:47:40,323
What's crack?

406
00:47:40,325 --> 00:47:45,895
Crack is a crystallized, highly addictive
derivative of the stimulant cocaine.

407
00:47:45,897 --> 00:47:50,166
In the mid-1980s, it accelerated the
decimation of inner-city neighborhoods.

408
00:47:50,168 --> 00:47:52,902
Crackheads... some of them
kids just like you guys...

409
00:47:52,904 --> 00:47:56,739
Were killing each other
over nothing, over their Nikes.

410
00:47:56,741 --> 00:47:58,875
They killed each other for Nike?

411
00:47:58,877 --> 00:48:00,710
The Greek winged goddess
of victory?

412
00:48:00,712 --> 00:48:03,913
Stop.

413
00:48:03,915 --> 00:48:05,815
He's joking, right?

414
00:48:07,751 --> 00:48:09,752
They're-they're
like Adidas.

415
00:48:09,754 --> 00:48:12,889
- Who's Adidas?
- You're serious?

416
00:48:14,492 --> 00:48:15,658
They're shoes.

417
00:48:22,199 --> 00:48:24,367
Now?

418
00:48:24,369 --> 00:48:26,235
Ben.

419
00:48:26,237 --> 00:48:31,440
We're, uh... i-i just...
I'm sorry for your loss.

420
00:48:31,442 --> 00:48:35,111
We're devastated.

421
00:48:35,113 --> 00:48:40,082
- We're just... so sorry.
- Thank you, Dave.

422
00:48:42,019 --> 00:48:44,220
I don't... i-i don't know
what else to say.

423
00:48:44,222 --> 00:48:45,955
I'm like...

424
00:48:45,957 --> 00:48:49,358
It's okay. We all know you
had issues with Leslie.

425
00:48:49,360 --> 00:48:51,627
- What?
- It's not a secret.

426
00:48:51,629 --> 00:48:54,397
I wouldn't say that.
Why would you...

427
00:48:54,399 --> 00:48:56,766
Last time we saw you, you
called her a fucking bitch.

428
00:48:56,768 --> 00:48:58,401
Ben.
What?

429
00:48:58,403 --> 00:49:00,803
It's fine.
My kids remember.

430
00:49:00,805 --> 00:49:02,705
- Don't you guys?
- Yeah.

431
00:49:02,707 --> 00:49:05,107
Wait, no.

432
00:49:05,109 --> 00:49:08,144
I said that...

433
00:49:08,146 --> 00:49:12,915
We were all having a huge,
uh, fight about sugar.

434
00:49:12,917 --> 00:49:16,585
I had given the kids
some, what, frosted mini-wheats.

435
00:49:16,587 --> 00:49:18,955
And the extremity
of her position...

436
00:49:20,424 --> 00:49:22,458
She was yelling at me.
She pushed me.

437
00:49:22,460 --> 00:49:24,293
- And I said... -"don't be
such a fucking bitch."

438
00:49:24,295 --> 00:49:25,995
Ben.
I didn't say that.

439
00:49:25,997 --> 00:49:28,331
They're just words.
Your words, but just words.

440
00:49:28,333 --> 00:49:30,900
- Not spoken in this house.
- It's inappropriate in front...

441
00:49:30,902 --> 00:49:32,835
To say that
in front of the kids.

442
00:49:34,938 --> 00:49:36,772
Absolutely. Understood.

443
00:49:36,774 --> 00:49:38,641
It won't happen again.
Okay.

444
00:49:49,619 --> 00:49:51,520
Dad, how did aunt Leslie die?

445
00:49:51,522 --> 00:49:54,090
Well, aunt Leslie was sick,

446
00:49:54,092 --> 00:49:57,994
and she had complications
from her sickness.

447
00:49:57,996 --> 00:49:59,261
Yeah.

448
00:50:01,465 --> 00:50:03,199
She had a mental illness.

449
00:50:03,201 --> 00:50:05,634
Bipolar affective disorder.

450
00:50:05,636 --> 00:50:07,603
We think it started
right after Bo was born.

451
00:50:07,605 --> 00:50:10,806
Probably a form
of postpartum psychosis.

452
00:50:10,808 --> 00:50:13,342
She'd have violent mood swings

453
00:50:13,344 --> 00:50:15,978
ranging from mania,
where she'd be elated

454
00:50:15,980 --> 00:50:19,181
and make elaborate plans
for the future,

455
00:50:19,183 --> 00:50:22,051
to severe depression, where
she'd become almost catatonic,

456
00:50:23,186 --> 00:50:26,689
utterly without hope.

457
00:50:26,691 --> 00:50:29,358
We didn't... we didn't
understand what was happening.

458
00:50:29,360 --> 00:50:31,961
We don't need to talk about
this in front of the children.

459
00:50:31,963 --> 00:50:33,629
These are details that are...

460
00:50:33,631 --> 00:50:37,900
Yeah. The doctors, um,
put her in the hospital.

461
00:50:37,902 --> 00:50:41,871
They gave her medicine, but
she was really sick. Yeah.

462
00:50:41,873 --> 00:50:47,710
And she... died.

463
00:50:49,346 --> 00:50:51,480
Sick people die.

464
00:50:55,185 --> 00:50:59,388
Sometimes they-they die.

465
00:50:59,390 --> 00:51:03,692
She died 'cause of...

466
00:51:03,694 --> 00:51:06,162
Because of her, uh...
Because of the sickness.

467
00:51:06,164 --> 00:51:09,832
She slit her wrists. She killed herself.
That's what happened.

468
00:51:09,834 --> 00:51:11,300
Or that.

469
00:51:25,549 --> 00:51:27,016
Excuse me.

470
00:51:40,464 --> 00:51:42,364
- Here you go, sweetie.
- Thank you.

471
00:51:45,202 --> 00:51:46,502
Bo?

472
00:51:56,046 --> 00:51:58,547
- To mom.
- To mom.

473
00:52:02,619 --> 00:52:05,221
Shh.

474
00:52:09,393 --> 00:52:10,993
<i>Combo!</i>

475
00:52:14,664 --> 00:52:16,765
<i>Extreme combo!</i>

476
00:52:19,670 --> 00:52:21,637
<i>You are dead!</i>

477
00:52:21,639 --> 00:52:24,406
We're just doing the best we can, Ben.
That's all anybody is doing.

478
00:52:24,408 --> 00:52:26,575
So am I! Just the best
that we know how.

479
00:52:26,577 --> 00:52:28,644
I'm sorry it doesn't live up
to your high standards!

480
00:52:28,646 --> 00:52:31,413
I tell the truth to my kids.
I don't lie to my kids.

481
00:52:31,415 --> 00:52:33,349
Protecting children
from certain concepts

482
00:52:33,351 --> 00:52:36,452
that they are too young to
understand is not lying to them.

483
00:52:36,454 --> 00:52:38,454
Guys!
We have neighbors, okay?

484
00:52:38,456 --> 00:52:42,191
Look, it's a... it's a
very hard time right now.

485
00:52:42,193 --> 00:52:44,026
Everybody's still a little raw.

486
00:52:44,028 --> 00:52:48,030
Can we just try to, come on,
put this to bed, all right?

487
00:52:54,104 --> 00:52:55,571
I apologize.

488
00:52:57,474 --> 00:53:01,010
I'm sorry for not respecting the way
you guys do things in your home.

489
00:53:03,480 --> 00:53:06,115
Thank you for saying that.

490
00:53:11,054 --> 00:53:13,622
I know Leslie had been sick
for a long time,

491
00:53:13,624 --> 00:53:16,458
but I cannot imagine how difficult
this time must be for you.

492
00:53:32,142 --> 00:53:34,410
Uh, guys, what-what
are you doing?

493
00:53:34,412 --> 00:53:36,278
We're sleeping under the stars.

494
00:53:37,981 --> 00:53:40,649
- But... -we made up the rec room
downstairs for a sleepover.

495
00:53:40,651 --> 00:53:42,585
Yeah.

496
00:53:42,587 --> 00:53:45,454
We're fine here.
We're fine.

497
00:53:48,325 --> 00:53:49,792
Okay.

498
00:54:03,440 --> 00:54:05,674
Why do they have
to take showers?

499
00:54:05,676 --> 00:54:06,801
They're not taking a shower.

500
00:54:06,826 --> 00:54:09,411
I mean, it looks like a shower,
but it's really a gas chamber.

501
00:54:09,413 --> 00:54:13,382
Jackson, put that away or I'm gonna put
it in the microwave, press popcorn.

502
00:54:13,384 --> 00:54:15,684
All right.

503
00:54:15,686 --> 00:54:19,221
Actually, why don't you take your cousins
and go show them your action figure guys?

504
00:54:19,223 --> 00:54:21,624
- Why? -Because they may never
have seen them before.

505
00:54:21,626 --> 00:54:24,226
It might be fun. So, can
we play Xbox afterwards?

506
00:54:24,228 --> 00:54:26,195
One game. Go.

507
00:54:26,197 --> 00:54:27,796
Yes!

508
00:54:29,032 --> 00:54:31,367
Thank you.
Yeah, try it.

509
00:54:40,076 --> 00:54:43,312
- How are the kids doing?
- They're strong.

510
00:54:43,314 --> 00:54:46,715
How long have you been out there...
wherever it is you're living now?

511
00:54:46,717 --> 00:54:49,818
We left Boulder
when Bo was three.

512
00:54:49,820 --> 00:54:53,322
And then we were on that farm we
had in Oregon until he was eight.

513
00:54:53,324 --> 00:54:55,724
So, we bought the land
in the forest 10 years ago.

514
00:54:55,726 --> 00:54:58,661
How do you still have money?

515
00:54:58,663 --> 00:55:00,663
We only buy what we need.

516
00:55:00,665 --> 00:55:03,232
Look, Harper and I
have been talking.

517
00:55:04,567 --> 00:55:06,802
The kids need
structure, stability.

518
00:55:06,804 --> 00:55:10,339
They need to go to a real school,
so they can get real jobs.

519
00:55:10,341 --> 00:55:12,608
Oh, for Christ's sake. You're
going to get them killed!

520
00:55:12,610 --> 00:55:14,076
Whoa.

521
00:55:20,116 --> 00:55:21,817
I'm sorry.

522
00:55:21,819 --> 00:55:24,019
But your kids are
without a mother now.

523
00:55:24,021 --> 00:55:26,955
I don't think you have any idea
what you're doing to them.

524
00:55:26,957 --> 00:55:29,591
I'm saving their lives.
That's what I'm doing.

525
00:55:29,593 --> 00:55:32,261
Ben, you sound so ridiculous.

526
00:55:32,263 --> 00:55:36,165
Is knowing how to set a broken bone or
how to treat a severe burn ridiculous?

527
00:55:36,167 --> 00:55:40,135
Knowing how to navigate by the stars
in total darkness... that's ridiculous?

528
00:55:40,137 --> 00:55:43,472
How to identify edible plants, how
to make clothes from animal skins,

529
00:55:43,474 --> 00:55:45,841
how to survive in the forest
with nothing but a knife?

530
00:55:45,843 --> 00:55:48,510
That's ridiculous to you?
Jesus.

531
00:55:48,512 --> 00:55:51,947
They have the cardiovascular and muscular
endurance levels of elite athletes.

532
00:55:51,949 --> 00:55:54,316
Who cares?
They're children!

533
00:55:54,318 --> 00:55:57,353
They need to go to school. They
need to learn about the world.

534
00:55:59,556 --> 00:56:02,658
Justin. Jackson?

535
00:56:02,660 --> 00:56:06,295
Would you please come
down here for a second?

536
00:56:15,004 --> 00:56:17,139
What?

537
00:56:17,141 --> 00:56:19,942
How old are you now, Jackson?
Thirteen.

538
00:56:22,178 --> 00:56:24,480
Can you tell me
what the bill of rights is?

539
00:56:26,750 --> 00:56:30,252
Um, what something costs,
I guess.

540
00:56:30,254 --> 00:56:32,221
That's a good guess.

541
00:56:32,223 --> 00:56:34,256
- Justin, you're in high school?
- Yeah.

542
00:56:34,258 --> 00:56:37,159
Do you like your school?
It's whatever.

543
00:56:39,396 --> 00:56:42,231
Do you know what
the bill of rights is?

544
00:56:42,233 --> 00:56:45,000
It's a government thing, right?

545
00:56:45,002 --> 00:56:48,203
Like, rights that people
have in America and stuff.

546
00:56:48,205 --> 00:56:49,772
Yep. Hey, Zaja?

547
00:56:49,774 --> 00:56:51,840
Yes?

548
00:56:51,842 --> 00:56:54,143
Would you please come
down here a moment, sweetie?

549
00:56:56,679 --> 00:56:59,348
I wanted to ask you
a quick question.

550
00:56:59,350 --> 00:57:02,451
Zaja's just turned eight,
by the way.

551
00:57:02,453 --> 00:57:04,086
The bill of rights.

552
00:57:05,288 --> 00:57:07,523
Amendment one:
Congress shall make no law

553
00:57:07,525 --> 00:57:09,558
respecting an establishment
of religion,

554
00:57:09,560 --> 00:57:13,028
or prohibiting
the free exercise thereof;

555
00:57:13,030 --> 00:57:14,696
- or abridging the freedom of...
- stop.

556
00:57:14,698 --> 00:57:18,066
Regurgitating memorized amendments
isn't what I'm asking for.

557
00:57:18,068 --> 00:57:20,369
Just tell me something about
it in your own words.

558
00:57:22,906 --> 00:57:26,241
Without the bill of rights,
we'd be more like China.

559
00:57:26,243 --> 00:57:29,411
Here, at least, we don't
have warrantless searches.

560
00:57:29,413 --> 00:57:31,146
We have free speech.

561
00:57:31,148 --> 00:57:33,816
Citizens are protected from
cruel and unusual punishments...

562
00:57:33,818 --> 00:57:35,417
- That's enough.
- Are protected...

563
00:57:35,419 --> 00:57:37,719
Wait a minute. Zaja.

564
00:57:37,721 --> 00:57:41,457
How would you characterize the 2010 supreme
court decision on citizens united?

565
00:57:42,826 --> 00:57:45,260
Corporations have
the same rights as people,

566
00:57:45,262 --> 00:57:47,663
so there's no spending limit
on candidates.

567
00:57:47,665 --> 00:57:51,300
Which means our country is ruled by
corporations and their lobbyists

568
00:57:51,302 --> 00:57:54,670
who fund candidates and command
their fealty by demanding that...

569
00:57:54,672 --> 00:57:57,339
Jesus Christ. You made your point.
We get it.

570
00:57:59,342 --> 00:58:01,977
It's very impressive.
All of you.

571
00:59:52,055 --> 00:59:54,022
Is that yoga?

572
00:59:56,392 --> 00:59:59,528
Your breath.
They call it "Pranayama."

573
00:59:59,530 --> 01:00:02,130
It flows with your movements,
your Asana.

574
01:00:02,132 --> 01:00:06,535
It's supposed to connect the mind
and the body to fuel your Samadhi.

575
01:00:06,537 --> 01:00:08,203
Does that really work?

576
01:00:26,990 --> 01:00:29,391
I'm Claire.

577
01:00:31,661 --> 01:00:33,395
Bodevan.

578
01:00:33,397 --> 01:00:34,730
Bodevan?

579
01:00:34,732 --> 01:00:36,698
What kind of a name is that?

580
01:00:41,571 --> 01:00:43,005
My parents made it up.

581
01:00:44,273 --> 01:00:46,775
That's weird. Why?

582
01:00:46,777 --> 01:00:50,245
Our names are unique. There's only
one of us in the whole world.

583
01:00:52,248 --> 01:00:53,682
That's really weird.

584
01:01:07,697 --> 01:01:09,931
What kind of music
do you listen to?

585
01:01:11,534 --> 01:01:13,835
Mostly Bach.

586
01:01:13,837 --> 01:01:15,537
Mainly the Goldberg variations,

587
01:01:15,539 --> 01:01:18,006
especially Glenn Gould's
versions.

588
01:01:18,008 --> 01:01:22,377
I also like the unaccompanied cello suites,
preferably when played by yo-yo ma.

589
01:01:26,216 --> 01:01:27,749
Where are you from?

590
01:01:30,820 --> 01:01:34,322
Most recently in Paris,
in the Marais.

591
01:01:34,324 --> 01:01:37,526
Near Victor Hugo's house.

592
01:01:37,528 --> 01:01:40,629
We're just back in the states
because of my dad's sabbatical.

593
01:01:40,631 --> 01:01:44,299
He's writing a book
on Dr. Spock.

594
01:01:44,301 --> 01:01:46,635
Oh, I love<i> Star Trek.</i>
It's awesome.

595
01:01:49,038 --> 01:01:52,674
- Which star?
- You know, Spock.

596
01:01:52,676 --> 01:01:55,043
The guy with the ears,
he's from<i> Star Trek.</i>

597
01:01:55,045 --> 01:01:56,745
No, Dr. Spock
was from Connecticut.

598
01:01:56,747 --> 01:02:00,248
Right after Yale, he wrote
<i>baby and child care</i> in 1947.

599
01:02:00,250 --> 01:02:02,484
It's one of the seminal books
on child-rearing.

600
01:02:02,486 --> 01:02:06,221
I was talking about
that old TV show.

601
01:02:07,724 --> 01:02:09,057
Oh.

602
01:02:09,059 --> 01:02:11,259
Child-rearing.
Of course.

603
01:02:11,261 --> 01:02:15,230
Yeah, I-i know that one.
It's... awesome.

604
01:02:20,369 --> 01:02:22,304
And what about your mom?

605
01:02:26,542 --> 01:02:28,477
I can't talk about it.

606
01:02:30,446 --> 01:02:32,314
She works for the us government.

607
01:02:33,950 --> 01:02:37,018
I can't talk about it due to
its highly classified nature.

608
01:02:37,020 --> 01:02:40,255
Seriously?
I-i-i can't say any more.

609
01:02:40,257 --> 01:02:43,091
I-I don't even know
that much myself.

610
01:02:43,093 --> 01:02:46,428
It's, um...
I shouldn't have told you.

611
01:02:46,430 --> 01:02:49,531
You can't tell anyone.

612
01:03:21,931 --> 01:03:23,031
Are you okay?

613
01:03:26,102 --> 01:03:29,171
Yeah.

614
01:03:52,662 --> 01:03:55,630
Follow me.
We have to be quiet.

615
01:04:03,307 --> 01:04:05,440
It's almost midnight.

616
01:04:08,144 --> 01:04:12,380
I sincerely hope you two lovebirds haven't
been doing what I think you've been doing.

617
01:04:18,521 --> 01:04:20,322
I know what you think.

618
01:04:20,324 --> 01:04:23,291
But I know that your daughter has
taught me many things just now.

619
01:04:23,293 --> 01:04:26,228
She has broadened my mind,
she has helped me grow.

620
01:04:26,230 --> 01:04:28,663
When we just kissed for the
first time just then, it...

621
01:04:28,665 --> 01:04:30,799
The endorphins that your
daughter sent through my body

622
01:04:30,801 --> 01:04:32,534
were like dolphins swimming
through my bloodstream.

623
01:04:32,536 --> 01:04:35,637
The way she has opened me up, she
has penetrated deep inside of me,

624
01:04:35,639 --> 01:04:38,540
and I know that I have penetrated
deep, deep inside of your daughter.

625
01:04:38,542 --> 01:04:40,976
And... but not-not like that.

626
01:04:40,978 --> 01:04:45,647
I would love to when...
When it's necessary for...

627
01:04:45,649 --> 01:04:48,316
I-I want kids someday.
Not right now, of course.

628
01:04:48,318 --> 01:04:51,820
But when you're ready, when I'm ready, because
I think this should be a shared decision.

629
01:04:51,822 --> 01:04:54,582
This is a decision that
we should make together.

630
01:04:54,607 --> 01:04:56,892
But when you are ready,
I will be ready.

631
01:04:56,894 --> 01:05:01,830
I am ready for you,
if you will have me.

632
01:05:01,832 --> 01:05:03,298
Claire.

633
01:05:05,001 --> 01:05:06,835
What's your last name?

634
01:05:06,837 --> 01:05:08,036
M-m-Mccune.

635
01:05:08,038 --> 01:05:12,474
Claire Mccune,
will you be my wife?

636
01:05:23,587 --> 01:05:27,689
Okay, funny man,
I'm sure your dad's waiting up.

637
01:05:27,691 --> 01:05:31,026
Don't worry.
You'll see her tomorrow.

638
01:05:31,028 --> 01:05:32,494
Good night.

639
01:06:15,404 --> 01:06:19,174
It's just a penis.
Every man has one.

640
01:06:19,176 --> 01:06:22,243
We're all animals of the earth.

641
01:06:22,245 --> 01:06:24,579
Clothes when we eat!

642
01:07:44,761 --> 01:07:46,294
Mmm.

643
01:07:59,075 --> 01:08:02,010
You look happy.
I am happy.

644
01:08:02,012 --> 01:08:05,113
Are you happy? Yeah.
I'm here with you.

645
01:08:21,430 --> 01:08:25,567
O god, to whom mercy
and forgiveness belong,

646
01:08:25,569 --> 01:08:30,271
hear our prayer on behalf of
your servant Leslie cash,

647
01:08:30,273 --> 01:08:33,374
whom you have taken
out of the world.

648
01:08:33,376 --> 01:08:37,412
And because she put her trust
and hope in you,

649
01:08:37,414 --> 01:08:41,883
command that she be carried
safely home to heaven

650
01:08:41,885 --> 01:08:46,221
and come to enjoy
your eternal reward.

651
01:08:46,223 --> 01:08:47,288
- Amen.
- Amen.

652
01:08:50,227 --> 01:08:52,861
- Come on, guys.
- Who is that?

653
01:09:05,608 --> 01:09:07,242
Do you mind scooting over, sir?

654
01:09:17,187 --> 01:09:21,456
I did not know
Leslie personally,

655
01:09:21,458 --> 01:09:24,292
and I am poorer for it.

656
01:09:24,294 --> 01:09:27,362
I understand that
she was a loving mother

657
01:09:27,364 --> 01:09:31,032
who gave up her law practice
to raise her children.

658
01:09:31,034 --> 01:09:32,800
Leslie loved her mother,
Abigail,

659
01:09:32,802 --> 01:09:34,602
and her father, Jack,

660
01:09:34,604 --> 01:09:39,340
and their dogs,
Harvey and little bear.

661
01:09:39,342 --> 01:09:44,612
They told me that she also loved
gardening and classical music,

662
01:09:44,614 --> 01:09:49,817
particularly Glenn Gould's versions
of the Goldberg variations.

663
01:09:49,819 --> 01:09:55,857
She also liked walks
in the moonlight on the beach.

664
01:09:55,859 --> 01:10:00,028
And she loved her husband Ben
and their children...

665
01:10:00,030 --> 01:10:03,665
I'll, uh, take that
as my cue, if I may.

666
01:10:14,076 --> 01:10:18,179
First of all,
Leslie practiced Buddhism,

667
01:10:18,181 --> 01:10:21,482
which to her was a philosophy
and not an organized religion.

668
01:10:21,484 --> 01:10:25,353
In fact, Leslie abhorred
all organized religions.

669
01:10:25,355 --> 01:10:28,323
To her, they were the most dangerous
fairy tales ever invented,

670
01:10:28,325 --> 01:10:31,059
designed to elicit
blind obedience

671
01:10:31,061 --> 01:10:33,701
and strike fear into the hearts of
the innocent and the uninformed.

672
01:10:35,232 --> 01:10:37,432
To her, the only thing
worse than death

673
01:10:37,434 --> 01:10:39,500
would have been the knowledge
that her rotting flesh

674
01:10:39,502 --> 01:10:41,936
was to be trapped for all
eternity inside a big box...

675
01:10:43,573 --> 01:10:45,873
And buried in the middle
of a fucking golf course.

676
01:10:48,545 --> 01:10:54,215
Although the absurdity of being eulogized
by someone that didn't even know her

677
01:10:54,217 --> 01:10:58,586
has exactly the kind of comedic flourish
that Leslie would have cherished.

678
01:10:58,588 --> 01:11:01,756
If nothing else,
she had a sense of humor.

679
01:11:01,758 --> 01:11:05,793
I want to read something to all of
you, so you'll know what I mean.

680
01:11:05,795 --> 01:11:08,696
Leslie's last will
and testament.

681
01:11:08,698 --> 01:11:11,432
And I quote,
"in the event of my death,

682
01:11:11,434 --> 01:11:16,037
I, Leslie Abigail cash, as a
Buddhist, wish to be cremated.

683
01:11:16,039 --> 01:11:20,541
My funeral, such as it is, shall be
a celebration of the life cycle,

684
01:11:20,543 --> 01:11:22,977
with music and dancing.

685
01:11:22,979 --> 01:11:25,813
After, it is my expressed desire
that my ashes

686
01:11:25,815 --> 01:11:28,316
shall be taken to
a nondescript location,

687
01:11:28,318 --> 01:11:30,818
preferably public
and heavily populated.

688
01:11:30,820 --> 01:11:34,555
At which point my ashes,
promptly and unceremoniously,

689
01:11:34,557 --> 01:11:36,624
are to be flushed down
the nearest toilet."

690
01:11:36,626 --> 01:11:38,459
End quote.

691
01:11:39,828 --> 01:11:41,596
Now that's comedy.

692
01:11:41,598 --> 01:11:43,398
Sir, that's enough.
I'm not finished.

693
01:11:43,400 --> 01:11:44,999
Hey, wait, I'm not finished.

694
01:11:45,001 --> 01:11:47,001
- Dad!
- You're not listening to me.

695
01:11:47,003 --> 01:11:48,636
Dad!
This is not what she wanted!

696
01:11:48,638 --> 01:11:50,738
- Keep moving. -Come on.
- Let go of me!

697
01:11:50,740 --> 01:11:52,140
Dad!

698
01:11:52,142 --> 01:11:53,808
She's my wife!
This is her will!

699
01:11:53,810 --> 01:11:56,177
This is against her wishes!

700
01:11:56,179 --> 01:11:59,614
Goddamn it!
We have songs to sing!

701
01:11:59,616 --> 01:12:01,282
Dad!

702
01:12:01,284 --> 01:12:03,151
If you'll open your books,

703
01:12:03,153 --> 01:12:09,023
we'll read this morning
from Matthew 18, verses 15-20.

704
01:12:45,227 --> 01:12:48,196
You are the worst thing that has
ever happened to my family.

705
01:12:48,198 --> 01:12:50,565
Why won't you respect
your daughter's wishes?

706
01:12:50,567 --> 01:12:52,734
Or your grandchildren's?

707
01:12:52,736 --> 01:12:54,369
Hi, kids.

708
01:12:54,371 --> 01:12:56,838
Honey.
Hello, grandpa, I'm Nai.

709
01:12:56,840 --> 01:12:59,140
Nai. We've never met.

710
01:12:59,142 --> 01:13:01,542
Hey, Abby. I'm sorry.

711
01:13:01,544 --> 01:13:03,378
I'm sorry.

712
01:13:05,381 --> 01:13:06,881
Hi, honey.

713
01:13:07,716 --> 01:13:10,151
Grandma!

714
01:13:10,153 --> 01:13:13,087
Hello, grandma.

715
01:13:13,089 --> 01:13:16,424
We're all together.
Isn't this wonderful?

716
01:13:16,426 --> 01:13:18,826
Abby and I are gonna take
the children to the ceremony,

717
01:13:18,828 --> 01:13:21,496
and then you can
follow us to the house.

718
01:13:21,498 --> 01:13:24,031
They're my kids.
They're staying with me.

719
01:13:24,033 --> 01:13:26,834
Children, I'm sorry that you
have to witness this,

720
01:13:26,836 --> 01:13:29,670
but I don't think your father
is fit to attend the funeral.

721
01:13:29,672 --> 01:13:31,706
We're not gonna let you
put her in the ground!

722
01:13:31,708 --> 01:13:34,175
Who do you think the police
are gonna listen to? Me?

723
01:13:34,177 --> 01:13:37,111
Or some hippie
in a clown outfit?

724
01:13:37,113 --> 01:13:39,547
- Come on, Abby.
- Where are we going? I'm...

725
01:13:39,549 --> 01:13:41,783
- We're going to see Leslie.
- I'm visiting with the children.

726
01:13:41,785 --> 01:13:44,285
- We have to see them at the house.
- Give me a minute...

727
01:13:44,287 --> 01:13:49,557
Honey, Leslie is waiting. Leslie
is waiting. Come on. Okay.

728
01:13:49,559 --> 01:13:51,592
- Bye, grandma.
- Bye, grandma and grandpa.

729
01:13:57,366 --> 01:13:59,967
Back on Steve.
Let's go.

730
01:13:59,969 --> 01:14:02,270
- Dad?
- Let's go.

731
01:14:02,272 --> 01:14:04,939
Dad, where are we going? We're going
to stop this fucking funeral!

732
01:14:04,941 --> 01:14:08,576
- No, dad!
- No! Dad, no!

733
01:14:08,578 --> 01:14:10,778
- Dad, we can't go!
- Please, listen to us.

734
01:14:10,780 --> 01:14:13,214
- Why can't we go to mom's funeral?
- Because of dad.

735
01:14:13,216 --> 01:14:15,283
- Because of his speech?
- Yes!

736
01:14:15,285 --> 01:14:16,651
Everyone shut up and sit down!

737
01:14:16,653 --> 01:14:17,919
Sit the fuck down!
Dad.

738
01:14:17,921 --> 01:14:20,988
Silence!
Put your goddamn seat belts on!

739
01:14:20,990 --> 01:14:23,458
- No! Stop Steve! -You heard grandpa.
He'll have us arrested!

740
01:14:23,460 --> 01:14:25,493
They are not stopping us
from saving mom!

741
01:14:25,495 --> 01:14:27,462
Dad, abort the mission!
Go home!

742
01:14:27,464 --> 01:14:30,131
- Abort the mission!
- We are rescuing mom!

743
01:14:30,133 --> 01:14:32,667
Mom is dead! This is not
what she would have wanted...

744
01:14:32,669 --> 01:14:34,769
- They have no right!
- I don't want to lose you!

745
01:14:36,473 --> 01:14:40,741
Please. We can't lose you too.

746
01:15:08,971 --> 01:15:11,038
Motherfuck!

747
01:16:27,049 --> 01:16:31,319
I have memories of mom,
laughing.

748
01:16:35,691 --> 01:16:37,992
I can't even remember
when that was.

749
01:16:45,934 --> 01:16:48,269
Mom had psychotic episodes.

750
01:16:49,805 --> 01:16:51,706
She had hallucinations.

751
01:16:54,576 --> 01:16:57,612
Of smashing our heads in
with rocks.

752
01:16:57,614 --> 01:17:00,648
I heard them talking about it.

753
01:17:05,088 --> 01:17:08,322
Mom was sicker
than any of us knew.

754
01:17:08,324 --> 01:17:09,957
Dad<i> made</i> her crazy.

755
01:17:14,830 --> 01:17:16,897
Dad's dangerous.

756
01:17:22,572 --> 01:17:25,072
You think our lives
are so great.

757
01:17:25,074 --> 01:17:29,010
You think dad is so perfect.

758
01:18:06,381 --> 01:18:08,816
Yale, Stanford,
Princeton, Harvard,

759
01:18:08,818 --> 01:18:12,586
Dartmouth, MIT, brown.

760
01:18:16,391 --> 01:18:20,061
Whew.

761
01:18:21,063 --> 01:18:22,430
Well done.

762
01:18:23,865 --> 01:18:26,534
Thank you.
It's very impressive.

763
01:18:32,141 --> 01:18:34,075
I guess.

764
01:18:34,077 --> 01:18:35,576
Yeah.

765
01:18:37,546 --> 01:18:41,048
All this time you...
You've been deceiving me?

766
01:18:43,185 --> 01:18:47,021
What? No. I took you to the library
and you snuck around behind my back,

767
01:18:47,023 --> 01:18:50,591
taking sat tests
and contacting universities?

768
01:18:50,593 --> 01:18:53,194
Dad, it's not like that. We're
not an accredited home school.

769
01:18:53,196 --> 01:18:55,563
I don't know how
the fuck you did it.

770
01:18:55,565 --> 01:18:57,665
I guess you somehow managed...
You don't understand.

771
01:18:57,667 --> 01:19:00,267
To create acceptable transcripts,
got your work approved.

772
01:19:00,269 --> 01:19:03,838
Listen. Listen, dad, please. All
without my knowledge or approval.

773
01:19:03,840 --> 01:19:07,408
I don't know what's more impressive, the fact
that you got into all these fine schools,

774
01:19:07,410 --> 01:19:10,711
or... or that for months you've
been lying directly to my face.

775
01:19:10,713 --> 01:19:12,279
It was mom.

776
01:19:17,686 --> 01:19:20,621
She helped me with everything.
We did it together.

777
01:19:23,058 --> 01:19:24,792
I just want to go to college.

778
01:19:24,794 --> 01:19:27,461
You speak six languages. You have
high math, theoretical physics!

779
01:19:27,463 --> 01:19:30,898
This is what I'm talking about! What the
hell are these people going to teach you?

780
01:19:30,900 --> 01:19:33,801
I know nothing!
I know nothing!

781
01:19:33,803 --> 01:19:35,770
I am a freak because of you!

782
01:19:35,772 --> 01:19:38,572
You made us freaks!

783
01:19:38,574 --> 01:19:41,942
And mom knew that!
She understood!

784
01:19:41,944 --> 01:19:46,680
Unless it comes out of a fucking book,
I don't know anything about anything!

785
01:20:12,440 --> 01:20:14,642
Dad.

786
01:20:14,644 --> 01:20:16,243
You should put
some clothes on, buddy.

787
01:20:28,824 --> 01:20:30,958
No, stay on Steve.

788
01:20:30,960 --> 01:20:32,760
I'll be right back.

789
01:20:37,532 --> 01:20:39,300
Where is he?
No.

790
01:20:39,302 --> 01:20:41,869
Abby, I need Rell. It won't work like this.
You know Jack.

791
01:20:41,871 --> 01:20:43,370
He's<i> my</i> son.

792
01:20:46,107 --> 01:20:47,541
All right.

793
01:20:48,778 --> 01:20:52,012
It's all about timing.
Just be easy.

794
01:20:53,716 --> 01:20:55,683
Follow through.

795
01:20:59,455 --> 01:21:01,789
Okay, get your things.

796
01:21:01,791 --> 01:21:03,858
Just a minute, please.
Come on, Rell.

797
01:21:03,860 --> 01:21:06,527
I said "just a minute."

798
01:21:06,529 --> 01:21:10,030
I've clearly upset you,
and I apologize.

799
01:21:10,032 --> 01:21:11,966
- You killed mom!
- Oh.

800
01:21:22,077 --> 01:21:24,912
I heard you.

801
01:21:24,914 --> 01:21:28,649
I heard you fighting about where we live.
Mom wanted to leave.

802
01:21:28,651 --> 01:21:30,851
I heard.

803
01:21:30,853 --> 01:21:32,779
Your mother and I made
certain decisions,

804
01:21:32,804 --> 01:21:34,889
together, about what was
best for all of you.

805
01:21:34,891 --> 01:21:38,025
I'm going to live here
with Nana and grandpa.

806
01:21:38,027 --> 01:21:39,927
That's not possible.

807
01:21:39,929 --> 01:21:42,997
Come on, get your stuff.
Let's go.

808
01:21:46,101 --> 01:21:47,601
Let's go!

809
01:21:47,603 --> 01:21:51,739
I hate you!
I fucking hate you!

810
01:21:51,741 --> 01:21:54,408
Rellian.

811
01:21:54,410 --> 01:21:56,677
Rellian.

812
01:22:01,750 --> 01:22:03,751
What the fuck?

813
01:22:03,753 --> 01:22:06,921
- That almost hit me! -If I
wanted to, I would have hit you.

814
01:22:06,923 --> 01:22:10,658
You just shot an arrow at me!
You told me they were in school.

815
01:22:13,061 --> 01:22:16,530
They are. Leslie and I
are their teachers.

816
01:22:16,532 --> 01:22:18,365
Are...
Were their teachers.

817
01:22:18,367 --> 01:22:21,101
So you're teaching them to steal.
Of course not.

818
01:22:21,103 --> 01:22:23,203
"Mission: Free the food"?

819
01:22:24,806 --> 01:22:26,573
That was part of their training.

820
01:22:26,575 --> 01:22:28,642
So you're "training" them
to steal.

821
01:22:29,945 --> 01:22:32,546
Their mother had just died.

822
01:22:32,548 --> 01:22:35,749
They were in shock. They were devastated.
They needed a distraction.

823
01:22:35,751 --> 01:22:37,718
So we made it Noam Chomsky day.

824
01:22:37,720 --> 01:22:40,587
"Noam Chomsky day."
I don't even know who that is.

825
01:22:40,589 --> 01:22:43,457
That's the day you gave
my grandchildren real weapons.

826
01:22:45,727 --> 01:22:48,662
How did Rellian break his hand?

827
01:22:51,566 --> 01:22:55,669
He slip... he fell.
And it's not broken.

828
01:22:55,671 --> 01:22:57,808
He was climbing on a
rock face in the rain.

829
01:22:57,833 --> 01:22:58,973
It was an accident.

830
01:22:58,975 --> 01:23:01,108
And it wasn't raining
when we were climbing.

831
01:23:01,110 --> 01:23:03,777
He has bruises over his whole body.
Yeah, and scratches.

832
01:23:03,779 --> 01:23:06,280
- We all have them.
- It's child abuse.

833
01:23:06,282 --> 01:23:09,316
Even if they make it through
whatever it is you're doing to them,

834
01:23:09,318 --> 01:23:12,252
they're gonna be totally
unprepared for the real world.

835
01:23:12,254 --> 01:23:15,856
And I happen to think
the opposite is true.

836
01:23:15,858 --> 01:23:18,525
Rellian is legally
old enough to choose,

837
01:23:18,527 --> 01:23:21,562
and I intend
to honor his wishes.

838
01:23:25,433 --> 01:23:29,103
This is my lawyer's card.

839
01:23:29,105 --> 01:23:33,540
Abby and I have decided that we're gonna
file for custody of the children.

840
01:23:33,542 --> 01:23:36,844
Now I know you don't own a telephone,
but I suggest you find one immediately

841
01:23:36,846 --> 01:23:38,645
and call him,

842
01:23:38,647 --> 01:23:41,682
because I would hate to have to
issue a warrant for your arrest.

843
01:23:41,684 --> 01:23:45,853
He's my son. I'm not
leaving without him, Jack.

844
01:23:45,855 --> 01:23:47,721
Fine.

845
01:23:51,226 --> 01:23:53,160
Who's this?

846
01:23:53,162 --> 01:23:55,896
Hey! Hello, bill.
How are you?

847
01:23:55,898 --> 01:23:59,833
It's Jack Bertrang
from, um, up in Coronado.

848
01:23:59,835 --> 01:24:03,404
Listen, I think I just saw a prowler
wandering around outside on my grounds.

849
01:24:03,406 --> 01:24:08,475
I wonder if you'd send a car?
Thanks. Yeah.

850
01:24:08,477 --> 01:24:12,579
I hope you can explain Rellian's
injuries to the police, because I can't.

851
01:24:33,535 --> 01:24:36,437
Thanks again.
Sure thing, Mr. Bertrang.

852
01:24:47,715 --> 01:24:51,085
Okay, prisoner located.

853
01:24:51,087 --> 01:24:54,088
Second floor, second window,
above the garage.

854
01:24:57,625 --> 01:25:00,461
- Target locked.
- Bring him home, Vesp.

855
01:26:26,482 --> 01:26:28,315
- Vesp!
- Vespyr!

856
01:26:28,317 --> 01:26:32,753
Dad! Vespyr! Vesp!

857
01:26:56,744 --> 01:26:58,979
Mr. cash?

858
01:27:05,720 --> 01:27:07,688
She's got a decent concussion,

859
01:27:07,690 --> 01:27:11,024
but we did a cat scan and there's
absolutely no damage to the brain.

860
01:27:11,026 --> 01:27:14,728
She does have a slight fracture across
the tibia and fibula of her left leg.

861
01:27:14,730 --> 01:27:18,899
She's going to need a neck brace and
a cast, but otherwise she's fine.

862
01:27:18,901 --> 01:27:20,334
Can I show you something?

863
01:27:20,336 --> 01:27:24,271
Uh, this is
the top vertebrae here.

864
01:27:24,273 --> 01:27:27,007
This dark line... it's hard to see...
but that's the fracture line.

865
01:27:28,509 --> 01:27:30,344
What was she doing on a roof?

866
01:27:32,680 --> 01:27:34,915
Just playing.

867
01:27:34,917 --> 01:27:38,919
Well, for a girl her age
she's unusually strong.

868
01:27:38,921 --> 01:27:41,121
Yeah. There's seven
vertebrae in the neck.

869
01:27:41,123 --> 01:27:44,691
A break to any of the first four,
a tear to the spinal cord...

870
01:27:44,693 --> 01:27:49,196
I mean, if this had happened
just a few millimeters lower,

871
01:27:49,198 --> 01:27:51,398
we'd be talking about death
or paralysis.

872
01:27:54,869 --> 01:27:57,170
You're a very lucky man.

873
01:28:05,580 --> 01:28:07,781
Hey, guys, come on in.
Please, come in.

874
01:28:07,783 --> 01:28:09,583
Hi!
Hi, sweetheart.

875
01:28:09,585 --> 01:28:12,719
- Come right in, darling.
- Let me have your bag.

876
01:28:12,721 --> 01:28:15,455
Slow down, now.
Slow down.

877
01:28:15,457 --> 01:28:18,125
Let's go this way, darling.
This way, honey.

878
01:28:18,127 --> 01:28:20,117
We're going to go right
into the kitchen. Come

879
01:28:20,142 --> 01:28:21,895
on, let's get you something to eat.
Okay?

880
01:28:21,897 --> 01:28:25,866
And you'll have
a good night's sleep. Okay.

881
01:28:45,486 --> 01:28:47,921
One.
One.

882
01:28:47,923 --> 01:28:50,524
Two.
Two.

883
01:28:50,526 --> 01:28:51,792
Bodevan, kids: Three.

884
01:28:51,794 --> 01:28:53,927
Four.

885
01:28:53,929 --> 01:28:55,762
And then you come back, five.
Five.

886
01:28:55,764 --> 01:28:57,964
Like here. And you jump up
and clap your hands.

887
01:28:57,966 --> 01:28:59,633
Six.
Six.

888
01:29:02,504 --> 01:29:07,207
Grand... grandfather abuse. Grandfather
abuse. Grandpa down! Grandpa down!

889
01:29:13,348 --> 01:29:16,383
There's a lot in here, honey. I
want you to take whatever you want.

890
01:29:18,319 --> 01:29:22,022
There's something
I did want to show you.

891
01:29:22,024 --> 01:29:25,792
Just before you called about getting her
treatment, she sent me two letters.

892
01:29:25,794 --> 01:29:28,862
And I wanted to show
this one to you.

893
01:29:32,400 --> 01:29:37,871
"Dear mom, you don't need
to come get me anymore.

894
01:29:37,873 --> 01:29:40,807
Burn the other letter.

895
01:29:45,413 --> 01:29:51,051
What Ben and I have created here may
be unique in all of human existence.

896
01:29:51,053 --> 01:29:56,056
We created a paradise
out of Plato's<i> Republic.</i>

897
01:29:56,058 --> 01:29:58,325
Our children shall be
philosopher kings.

898
01:30:00,661 --> 01:30:04,765
It makes me so
indescribably happy.

899
01:30:04,767 --> 01:30:09,102
I'm going to get better
out here. I know I will.

900
01:30:09,104 --> 01:30:13,507
Because we are defined
by our actions, not our words."

901
01:30:40,034 --> 01:30:42,169
Like, not going home?

902
01:30:45,072 --> 01:30:46,540
Yeah.

903
01:30:48,209 --> 01:30:49,643
Like not going home.

904
01:30:50,978 --> 01:30:53,313
I am not staying here.

905
01:30:53,315 --> 01:30:56,049
This house is a vulgar display
of wealth.

906
01:30:56,051 --> 01:30:58,318
And an unethical use of space.

907
01:31:00,822 --> 01:31:02,656
I think you'll all be safe here.

908
01:31:02,658 --> 01:31:05,826
- But we want to live with you. -I
almost got you killed, sweetie.

909
01:31:05,828 --> 01:31:08,061
It was an accident.

910
01:31:08,063 --> 01:31:10,197
The tiles just cracked.

911
01:31:21,609 --> 01:31:26,313
It was a beautiful mistake,

912
01:31:28,082 --> 01:31:29,382
but a mistake.

913
01:31:36,424 --> 01:31:38,758
I thought it would help her.
I thought...

914
01:31:43,831 --> 01:31:47,901
I thought she'd get better out
there, you know? But, uh...

915
01:31:52,540 --> 01:31:55,642
It was too much.

916
01:31:55,644 --> 01:31:57,878
It was too much.
Too much.

917
01:31:59,146 --> 01:32:02,549
And I knew it.

918
01:32:03,985 --> 01:32:05,452
I did.

919
01:32:08,823 --> 01:32:10,524
I knew.

920
01:32:23,638 --> 01:32:25,272
Why can't we just stay with you?

921
01:32:29,176 --> 01:32:31,111
Because if you do...

922
01:32:33,180 --> 01:32:34,781
I'll ruin your lives.

923
01:32:44,258 --> 01:32:46,159
I'll call you in a few days.

924
01:33:12,286 --> 01:33:13,954
You know where you're heading?

925
01:33:18,193 --> 01:33:19,826
So?

926
01:33:30,938 --> 01:33:32,672
Hmm.

927
01:33:40,114 --> 01:33:43,249
Uh, I don't know. Maybe you
could take them hunting.

928
01:33:43,251 --> 01:33:46,886
They... they all like that. Okay.

929
01:33:46,888 --> 01:33:51,257
And, uh, Bo wants
to go to college.

930
01:33:51,259 --> 01:33:54,894
He got in everywhere,
all the best schools.

931
01:33:54,896 --> 01:34:00,233
I don't really know how we're going to pay
for all that. Ben, I'll take care of it.

932
01:34:00,235 --> 01:34:02,102
We're going to look after
your children.

933
01:34:02,104 --> 01:34:05,538
There's really nothing
to worry about, I promise.

934
01:34:07,908 --> 01:34:09,676
You're doing the right thing.

935
01:34:16,517 --> 01:34:18,918
Okay, well...

936
01:34:24,025 --> 01:34:25,492
Good luck, Ben.

937
01:34:26,861 --> 01:34:28,361
Thanks.

938
01:37:04,118 --> 01:37:06,052
You shaved your face.

939
01:37:20,501 --> 01:37:22,502
I don't hate you.

940
01:37:26,006 --> 01:37:27,440
I just wish you'd helped mom.

941
01:37:48,062 --> 01:37:50,363
Me too.

942
01:38:01,475 --> 01:38:05,912
- I'm sorry.
- I love ya.

943
01:38:17,424 --> 01:38:20,760
- We want to complete the mission.
- No.

944
01:38:20,762 --> 01:38:24,530
- There is no mission. -Mission:
Rescue dad and mommy.

945
01:38:24,532 --> 01:38:27,600
Mom wanted to be cremated.
And we want to honor her wishes.

946
01:38:27,602 --> 01:38:29,068
And flush her down the toilet.

947
01:38:30,838 --> 01:38:36,009
I can't put any of you
in danger ever again.

948
01:38:36,011 --> 01:38:37,911
I'm sorry.

949
01:38:37,913 --> 01:38:40,079
"If you assume
that there is no hope,

950
01:38:40,081 --> 01:38:42,715
then you guarantee
that there will be no hope.

951
01:38:42,717 --> 01:38:46,552
If you assume that there is
an instinct for freedom,

952
01:38:46,554 --> 01:38:48,354
that there are opportunities
to change things,

953
01:38:49,890 --> 01:38:52,125
then there is a possibility
that you can contribute

954
01:38:52,127 --> 01:38:54,193
to making a better world."

955
01:38:55,796 --> 01:38:57,797
Noam Chomsky.

956
01:39:33,834 --> 01:39:35,868
Dad, I found her.

957
01:39:56,857 --> 01:39:58,791
"Leslie Abigail cash.

958
01:39:58,793 --> 01:40:02,295
May god bless her soul
for all eternity."

959
01:40:02,297 --> 01:40:04,597
Let's dig.

960
01:40:04,599 --> 01:40:08,167
Otherwise she has to lie
under that bullshit forever.

961
01:40:36,830 --> 01:40:38,464
Mommy's in here.

962
01:43:21,562 --> 01:43:26,866
Hi, little bird.
It's me.

963
01:43:29,002 --> 01:43:32,905
I'm sorry
I didn't know what to do.

964
01:43:34,875 --> 01:43:37,743
I'm sorry if I made it worse.

965
01:43:47,521 --> 01:43:49,155
My face is mine,

966
01:43:49,157 --> 01:43:53,593
my hands are mine,

967
01:43:53,595 --> 01:43:57,496
my mouth is mine,

968
01:44:02,436 --> 01:44:04,570
but I'm not.

969
01:44:04,572 --> 01:44:06,572
I'm yours.

970
01:44:54,221 --> 01:44:56,689
Mom, here's your favorite song.

971
01:48:18,025 --> 01:48:19,725
Bye, mommy!

972
01:48:23,096 --> 01:48:24,697
I love you all, okay?

973
01:48:24,699 --> 01:48:27,099
We love you.

974
01:48:27,101 --> 01:48:29,668
Mmm, mmm.

975
01:48:29,670 --> 01:48:33,339
Why are you going to Namibia?
I just put my finger on a map.

976
01:48:43,717 --> 01:48:50,189
When you have sex with a woman,
be gentle and listen to her.

977
01:48:50,191 --> 01:48:52,992
Treat her with respect and dignity,
even if you don't love her.

978
01:48:52,994 --> 01:48:54,727
I know.

979
01:48:54,729 --> 01:48:58,063
Always tell the truth.
Always take the high road.

980
01:48:58,065 --> 01:48:59,865
I know.

981
01:48:59,867 --> 01:49:02,067
Live each day like
it could be your last.

982
01:49:02,069 --> 01:49:04,336
Drink it in.

983
01:49:04,338 --> 01:49:07,473
Be adventurous, be bold,
but savor it. It goes fast.

984
01:49:08,842 --> 01:49:10,309
I know.

985
01:49:12,412 --> 01:49:14,280
Don't die.

986
01:49:16,683 --> 01:49:18,384
I won't.

987
01:49:34,935 --> 01:49:36,669
Get out of here.

988
01:49:52,752 --> 01:49:56,155
Power to the people.
Stick it to the man.

989
01:50:29,557 --> 01:50:31,156
Hi, guys.

990
01:51:21,541 --> 01:51:24,777
Okay, eat your breakfast. The school
bus will be here in 15 minutes.
