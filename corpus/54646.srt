Director: Hiroyuki Kitakubo

19
00:07:16,905 --> 00:07:21,433
So the tap was still running
when you found her.

20
00:07:22,477 --> 00:07:25,878
Calm down, you don't have to cry.

21
00:07:29,117 --> 00:07:34,111
I'm not too sure, but I heard Mari was
going out with an American soldier.

22
00:07:38,894 --> 00:07:41,727
Mari from Charade's committed a suicide.

23
00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:45,527
Stupid girl.
She didn't have to kill herself.

24
00:07:46,001 --> 00:07:48,902
Maybe she's got the "clap".

25
00:07:50,238 --> 00:07:52,297
You can't get upset over
a minor thing

26
00:07:52,407 --> 00:07:54,602
if you're doing business
with American soldiers.

27
00:07:54,709 --> 00:07:59,169
Did you hear about the suicide
at the base school last month?

28
00:07:59,514 --> 00:08:02,677
There seems to be a lot of them lately.

29
00:08:03,685 --> 00:08:06,176
Apparently, everybody's really
uptight about it.

30
00:08:06,755 --> 00:08:10,122
How terrible.
I hope this doesn't affect business.

31
00:08:10,225 --> 00:08:14,855
It can't be helped if we're going to
make a living off the base.

32
00:08:15,297 --> 00:08:16,389
Huh?

33
00:08:16,731 --> 00:08:22,135
It can't be helped if we're going to
make a living off the base.

34
00:10:07,475 --> 00:10:11,912
Aren't you Japanese?
You are not a student here, are you?

35
00:10:13,381 --> 00:10:15,406
Did you pass through office?

36
00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:20,817
Hey, hold on a second!

37
00:10:23,491 --> 00:10:25,186
Where is the principal's office?

38
00:10:25,293 --> 00:10:26,225
Huh?

39
00:15:11,112 --> 00:15:13,672
So, this is their "dining room" then.

40
00:15:30,465 --> 00:15:31,932
Oh, you scared me.

41
00:15:33,301 --> 00:15:35,735
What were you doing here?

42
00:15:35,904 --> 00:15:39,101
Nothing. I thought I had a headache.

43
00:15:39,207 --> 00:15:40,231
But it's gone now.

44
00:15:41,643 --> 00:15:43,008
Oh. Wait!

45
00:15:45,747 --> 00:15:47,806
Hold on a minute!

46
00:19:09,851 --> 00:19:10,909
You...

47
00:19:43,718 --> 00:19:44,480
Hey!

48
00:19:46,354 --> 00:19:47,150
Hey!

49
00:19:50,124 --> 00:19:51,022
Listen to me!

50
00:19:51,425 --> 00:19:54,019
Listen, just forget what you just saw.

51
00:20:08,543 --> 00:20:11,535
Why... What is this...
You are...

52
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:18,250
Linda wasn't feeling well.
She was just sleeping...

53
00:20:18,786 --> 00:20:19,718
Linda...

54
00:20:20,755 --> 00:20:21,653
Linda...

55
00:20:42,710 --> 00:20:45,736
What? What is this?

56
00:20:46,714 --> 00:20:47,772
Linda...

57
00:21:31,392 --> 00:21:34,054
Hey, Mama-san, where's my beer?

58
00:21:35,229 --> 00:21:38,892
Oh, I'm sorry.

59
00:21:41,269 --> 00:21:43,499
Excuse me, I'll be right back.

60
00:26:10,905 --> 00:26:12,202
What are you doing?

61
00:26:12,673 --> 00:26:13,662
Run for it!

62
00:28:38,385 --> 00:28:39,352
Run!

63
00:29:31,105 --> 00:29:31,833
Go inside.

64
00:29:38,712 --> 00:29:40,202
What did you just do?

65
00:29:41,448 --> 00:29:44,212
What are you trying to do here?

66
00:29:44,651 --> 00:29:46,050
Shut up!

67
00:29:56,630 --> 00:29:59,724
Listen! Anyone who are
marked by "them" or

68
00:29:59,833 --> 00:30:02,734
anyone who has seen "his or her" real form,
aren't allowed to live.

69
00:30:03,904 --> 00:30:06,668
So, we've got to kill "them"
before "they" get us.

70
00:30:08,742 --> 00:30:10,266
What are "they"?

71
00:30:12,246 --> 00:30:15,738
Demons. They live off human blood.

72
00:30:34,168 --> 00:30:37,433
Shit! Isn't there something?

73
00:30:40,340 --> 00:30:41,432
Like what?

74
00:30:41,542 --> 00:30:42,804
A weapon.

75
00:30:47,514 --> 00:30:48,446
Here...

76
00:30:48,916 --> 00:30:51,043
That won't kill them.

77
00:30:51,585 --> 00:30:52,950
They won't die

78
00:30:53,053 --> 00:30:55,988
unless they lose enough blood
in one blow.

79
00:30:56,957 --> 00:30:59,084
Then, what is this gun for?

80
00:30:59,693 --> 00:31:01,456
You may need it.

81
00:31:04,898 --> 00:31:06,695
You can kill yourself as a last resort.

82
00:31:12,940 --> 00:31:13,929
Don't!

83
00:31:20,414 --> 00:31:21,438
Why me?

84
00:31:23,283 --> 00:31:24,682
Who are you?

85
00:31:27,254 --> 00:31:31,623
Why did you help me?

86
00:31:32,593 --> 00:31:37,860
You're lucky. I can't kill "humans".

87
00:32:03,857 --> 00:32:04,949
Shut up!

88
00:32:20,641 --> 00:32:21,733
Wait! Don't shoot!!

89
00:33:59,606 --> 00:34:01,267
I can't take this anymore.

90
00:34:05,278 --> 00:34:06,575
Don't give up!

91
00:34:06,847 --> 00:34:08,007
Get the car!

92
00:34:08,715 --> 00:34:10,273
Run the doors down!

93
00:42:49,736 --> 00:42:55,197
After all, I never understood
what I saw.

94
00:42:56,242 --> 00:43:01,805
That girl Saya, and the creatures
she killed, all remained a mystery.

95
00:43:02,348 --> 00:43:06,114
Only two students were noted as
having left for other schools.

96
00:43:07,820 --> 00:43:11,847
Could she still be somewhere
around the base?

97
00:43:13,026 --> 00:43:16,393
Is she still fighting those creatures?

98
00:43:16,996 --> 00:43:21,126
Just as we humans continue
to kill each other.

99
00:43:22,802 --> 00:43:26,602
That beautiful,
yet dangerous living thing...
