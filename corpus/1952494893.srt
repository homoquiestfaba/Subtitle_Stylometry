1
00:00:11,533 --> 00:00:16,532
You know, I always say there's nothing
better than Rose's roasted pork.

2
00:00:16,533 --> 00:00:19,198
Why, thank you, Norman.

3
00:00:19,233 --> 00:00:21,932
If I'd known, I would
have made you some.

4
00:00:21,933 --> 00:00:25,933
- That's lamb.
- Oh.

5
00:00:26,033 --> 00:00:29,132
Norman can't tell one
white meat from another.

6
00:00:29,133 --> 00:00:32,032
But I can, and it's
delicious. Thank you, Rose.

7
00:00:32,033 --> 00:00:35,233
Oh, it's the least I can do,

8
00:00:35,333 --> 00:00:40,523
considering you're supporting
my son's family these days.

9
00:00:40,933 --> 00:00:44,332
- It was a loan.
- Just to tide them over.

10
00:00:44,333 --> 00:00:48,732
You know, if you need money, you
only got to ask me. You know that.

11
00:00:48,733 --> 00:00:52,673
- More lamb, Norman?
- Don't mind if I do.

12
00:00:53,333 --> 00:00:57,567
I don't understand how young
people can get by these days.

13
00:00:57,568 --> 00:01:00,832
- Not hungry, Eileen?
- How's the job hunt going?

14
00:01:00,833 --> 00:01:02,432
You looking for a job?

15
00:01:02,433 --> 00:01:06,432
She got fired after 23
years of loyal service.

16
00:01:06,433 --> 00:01:10,633
- Mary rose, eat your beans.
- Excuse me.

17
00:01:41,333 --> 00:01:44,432
- Ok, girls, bath and then bed.
- Can I read?

18
00:01:44,433 --> 00:01:47,632
- Nope. It's a school night.
- I still have homework to do.

19
00:01:47,633 --> 00:01:52,103
- I thought you said you did it all.
- I forgot.

20
00:01:52,433 --> 00:01:55,232
- There's a cat.
- I don't see anything.

21
00:01:55,233 --> 00:02:00,732
It's just somebody's pet, girls.
Come on. Let's go. Come on.

22
00:02:00,733 --> 00:02:06,233
There it is. Oh! Oh, look.

23
00:02:06,333 --> 00:02:11,133
- Oh, it's just a baby.
- Can we keep her?

24
00:02:11,233 --> 00:02:14,132
- Her name is Rusty.
- That's a boy name.

25
00:02:14,133 --> 00:02:18,233
- No, it isn't.
- She looks hungry.

26
00:02:19,933 --> 00:02:22,433
Dad, can we keep her?

27
00:02:27,433 --> 00:02:31,733
- Aw!
- I thought you said 6:00, Dante.

28
00:02:31,833 --> 00:02:34,132
- I thought I heard 6.
- O was sitting at the bar. It was noisy.

29
00:02:34,133 --> 00:02:38,033
Well, what was it? Was it 6 or was it 7?

30
00:02:38,133 --> 00:02:41,132
Now you have me worried
about the whole fucking thing.

31
00:02:41,133 --> 00:02:45,432
- I wouldn't steer you wrong, Ralphie.
- No? Like the guy who sold you that hat?

32
00:02:45,433 --> 00:02:49,332
You like it, huh? It's my
trademark. Like Lester Young.

33
00:02:49,333 --> 00:02:52,732
- Who the fuck is Lester Young?
- You don't know Lester Young?

34
00:02:52,733 --> 00:02:55,632
I thought your trademark
was a Red Sox cap.

35
00:02:55,633 --> 00:02:58,332
- Not me. I hate baseball.
- You hate baseball? What?

36
00:02:58,333 --> 00:03:00,432
What are you, a fucking towel head?

37
00:03:00,433 --> 00:03:03,332
Fuck you. You don't even know
who Lester fucking Young is.

38
00:03:03,333 --> 00:03:05,833
Ay yi yi.

39
00:03:07,133 --> 00:03:12,433
Ah, here we go. What's this?

40
00:03:12,533 --> 00:03:16,183
That's Michael Caffee. I told you, see?

41
00:03:24,533 --> 00:03:27,632
Just 'cause he's meeting some
guy doesn't mean he's buying coke.

42
00:03:27,633 --> 00:03:34,083
That's what I heard. He's trying
to take over the action on the Hill.

43
00:03:45,433 --> 00:03:47,933
What's with the warehouse?

44
00:03:48,133 --> 00:03:50,753
Maybe they're swapping skins.

45
00:03:51,533 --> 00:03:55,532
You know, mutual masturbation?
Read about it at city vice.

46
00:03:55,533 --> 00:03:59,732
- Oh, you read about it? -
Fuck you. - Fuck you, too.

47
00:03:59,733 --> 00:04:03,532
- Let's go in.
- No. Let's be patient. Let's wait.

48
00:04:03,533 --> 00:04:04,767
Come on, Michael Caffee's
been jerking us around

49
00:04:04,768 --> 00:04:07,632
- since he got back. You know that.
- Yeah.

50
00:04:07,633 --> 00:04:11,363
I'm fucking starting to get pissed, too.

51
00:04:20,833 --> 00:04:23,767
Let's see who Michael
Caffee's doing business with.

52
00:04:23,768 --> 00:04:26,268
All right.

53
00:04:35,333 --> 00:04:41,313
- Get out of the car, Dante.
- Get out of the fucking car, Dante.

54
00:04:46,633 --> 00:04:49,632
Shitholes! How am I
supposed to get home now?

55
00:04:49,633 --> 00:04:52,133
What the fuck...

56
00:05:19,633 --> 00:05:21,632
We're almost to Mass.

57
00:05:21,633 --> 00:05:23,932
If we cross that state
line, we lose him.

58
00:05:23,933 --> 00:05:30,183
- Well, pull him over on expired tags.
- Right. Hit the lights. Yeah.

59
00:06:17,833 --> 00:06:20,317
Put your hands up!
Show your fucking hands!

60
00:06:20,318 --> 00:06:24,288
Let me see your goddamn
hands! Jesus! Fuck!

61
00:06:26,333 --> 00:06:30,833
- Is he dead?
- There's no fucking gun, Ralph.

62
00:06:30,933 --> 00:06:33,032
He had a gun. I saw a fucking gun.

63
00:06:33,033 --> 00:06:36,117
You fucking called a gun, but I
don't see a fucking goddamn gun.

64
00:06:36,118 --> 00:06:39,832
- Bullshit. He had a gun.
- There is no fucking gun in this car.

65
00:06:39,833 --> 00:06:41,332
There's no fucking gun in this car,

66
00:06:41,333 --> 00:06:44,367
and you just fucking
air-conditioned this douche bag.

67
00:06:44,368 --> 00:06:48,433
Jesus! Ah, fuck.

68
00:06:49,533 --> 00:06:54,333
- Is this your fucking gun?
- Fuck! Jesus Christ.

69
00:06:54,433 --> 00:06:59,332
They will fire me. I will
lose everything. My pension.

70
00:06:59,333 --> 00:07:03,832
- 23 years down the fucking
shitter. - You killed him? - Shit!

71
00:07:03,833 --> 00:07:07,232
- Jesus Christ, Michael.
- What the fuck happened here?

72
00:07:07,233 --> 00:07:13,553
Get out of here, ok? go. now. Ralph,
we're calling it in, all right?

73
00:07:14,033 --> 00:07:16,132
Jesus. Who is this fucking guy?

74
00:07:16,133 --> 00:07:21,033
Said his name was Morrill.
Lives outside of Attleboro.

75
00:07:22,833 --> 00:07:27,132
- Ah, Jesus. He's wearing a fucking wire.
- Oh, fuck!

76
00:07:27,133 --> 00:07:29,367
The guy's an informer, an
undercover cop or something.

77
00:07:29,368 --> 00:07:30,732
Let me see that thing.

78
00:07:30,733 --> 00:07:33,432
Get the fuck out of here. this
is evidence. Go. Right now.

79
00:07:33,433 --> 00:07:36,067
Ralph, we don't have a choice,
ok? I am calling this in.

80
00:07:36,068 --> 00:07:38,232
I wouldn't do that if I was you.

81
00:07:38,233 --> 00:07:39,567
Well, you're not me,
so shut the fuck up.

82
00:07:39,568 --> 00:07:41,032
You guys just shot

83
00:07:41,033 --> 00:07:43,317
an unarmed black law enforcement officer

84
00:07:43,318 --> 00:07:47,128
for no good reason.
They will crucify me.

85
00:07:47,333 --> 00:07:49,332
Just stop your whining,
Ralph, all right?

86
00:07:49,333 --> 00:07:51,532
You're not gonna starve.

87
00:07:51,533 --> 00:07:54,467
Worst thing that'll happen is you'll get
a job as a security guard or something.

88
00:07:54,468 --> 00:07:59,568
- You'll be fine.
- Why don't you get rid of the body?

89
00:08:00,633 --> 00:08:03,467
What the fuck are you
doing here anyway, huh?

90
00:08:03,468 --> 00:08:05,432
I saw you tailing Morrill.

91
00:08:05,433 --> 00:08:08,967
Thought I'd follow you, see
what the fuck was going on.

92
00:08:08,968 --> 00:08:10,532
- He's right.
- What?

93
00:08:10,533 --> 00:08:12,632
He's right. We got to
get rid of the body.

94
00:08:12,633 --> 00:08:14,832
No. This is crazy.

95
00:08:14,833 --> 00:08:17,298
It is not your ass on
the line. It's mine.

96
00:08:17,333 --> 00:08:19,532
- This is crazy.
- You didn't even fire your gun.

97
00:08:19,533 --> 00:08:24,032
- You'll skate. Go with me on this.
- No. this is crazy. I can't.

98
00:08:24,033 --> 00:08:27,467
You two guys did me a
favor killing this creep.

99
00:08:27,468 --> 00:08:29,984
So why don't you just
let me help you out?

100
00:08:29,985 --> 00:08:32,532
Michael Caffee is not
your fucking friend, ok?

101
00:08:32,533 --> 00:08:34,832
He's trying to save
his own ass right now.

102
00:08:34,833 --> 00:08:37,067
Use your fucking head
and do the right thing.

103
00:08:37,068 --> 00:08:39,568
- Fuck you.
- Call it in.

104
00:08:43,733 --> 00:08:48,593
The job's all I got, Decco.
Hey! How do we do this?

105
00:08:56,333 --> 00:08:59,243
- Go home. Go home.
- Fuck you.

106
00:09:00,633 --> 00:09:03,133
Go.

107
00:09:47,233 --> 00:09:51,732
Look, Alex, I want a comprehensive
list of every out-of-state developer

108
00:09:51,733 --> 00:09:55,132
who's petitioned the
E.D.C. in the past 60 days.

109
00:09:55,133 --> 00:09:59,432
- There's 2 companies? That's it?
- Damn it. What's this doing here?

110
00:09:59,433 --> 00:10:03,117
- Rusty got hungry.
- It's supposed to stay in the box.

111
00:10:03,118 --> 00:10:06,832
Ok. Give me the docket for
today's zoning board meeting.

112
00:10:06,833 --> 00:10:11,673
No, no. For the entire
city. You know, I warned you.

113
00:10:11,733 --> 00:10:15,032
I wasn't thinking clearly.
You should've stopped me.

114
00:10:15,033 --> 00:10:19,003
No. Today, ok?
Immediately. Get back to me.

115
00:10:20,033 --> 00:10:23,632
- I need $15, mom. -
For what? - Yearbook.

116
00:10:23,633 --> 00:10:27,603
- It's due today.
- Check in my pocketbook.

117
00:10:40,533 --> 00:10:43,813
Don't let it scratch your uniforms.

118
00:11:02,033 --> 00:11:04,533
Oh, shit.

119
00:11:07,533 --> 00:11:10,132
The first fucking car I
ever bought with my own money

120
00:11:10,133 --> 00:11:13,813
- was a '73 dodge charger.
- your money?

121
00:11:14,233 --> 00:11:17,932
- Yeah, so to speak.
- I need you to make it disappear.

122
00:11:17,933 --> 00:11:23,983
Why? it'd be a fucking shame to
get rid of a nice car like this.

123
00:11:25,733 --> 00:11:28,803
Oh, hello, nigger. Anyone I know?

124
00:11:30,233 --> 00:11:34,732
He was wearing a wire. He's
probably some kind of cop.

125
00:11:34,733 --> 00:11:38,333
Get rid of him. Today.

126
00:11:38,433 --> 00:11:40,732
I got to work the register at the store.

127
00:11:40,733 --> 00:11:44,467
- So close early. - I'll
lose money. - Who cares?

128
00:11:44,468 --> 00:11:46,332
I care.

129
00:11:46,333 --> 00:11:49,532
Well, close early tonight,
open early tomorrow morning.

130
00:11:49,533 --> 00:11:52,133
It all balances out.

131
00:11:52,233 --> 00:11:54,667
No. No one's gonna
know we're open early.

132
00:11:54,668 --> 00:11:57,168
Just get rid of it.

133
00:12:02,233 --> 00:12:04,733
Fucking piece of shit.

134
00:12:09,333 --> 00:12:11,833
Hey. Morning.

135
00:12:20,033 --> 00:12:23,843
- Did I drive?
- No, baby. You were good.

136
00:12:25,233 --> 00:12:27,733
You called me.

137
00:12:29,233 --> 00:12:34,153
- Well, at least I didn't puke, huh?
- You wanna bet?

138
00:12:42,233 --> 00:12:47,343
Oh, yeah. I flushed your
cigarettes. Thanks a lot, babe.

139
00:12:47,833 --> 00:12:50,663
Always looking out for me, huh?

140
00:12:51,233 --> 00:12:54,332
Hey, what was the name of
that refrigerator repair guy?

141
00:12:54,333 --> 00:12:59,332
Sergei... Vlad... something
like that. Russian. I don't know.

142
00:12:59,333 --> 00:13:01,867
Probably just gonna have to
get a whole new one anyway.

143
00:13:01,868 --> 00:13:03,932
It's not even keeping
anything cold anymore.

144
00:13:03,933 --> 00:13:05,967
You're probably just cramming
it with too much stuff.

145
00:13:05,968 --> 00:13:07,832
No, I am not.

146
00:13:07,833 --> 00:13:09,867
Besides, the ice maker
hasn't worked in over a year.

147
00:13:09,868 --> 00:13:11,832
I am so sick of buying
ice at the market.

148
00:13:11,833 --> 00:13:13,832
We can't afford a new
refrigerator right now.

149
00:13:13,833 --> 00:13:17,853
You're just gonna have
to fuckin' deal, ok?

150
00:13:20,233 --> 00:13:24,332
I thought we weren't worrying
about money right now.

151
00:13:24,333 --> 00:13:26,833
Sorry.

152
00:13:28,833 --> 00:13:31,333
What's wrong?

153
00:13:34,633 --> 00:13:37,133
It's nothing.

154
00:14:01,333 --> 00:14:06,732
Good morning. First order of business.
We've got a missing fbi agent.

155
00:14:06,733 --> 00:14:08,232
His name is Jack Wyatt.

156
00:14:08,233 --> 00:14:10,932
He was up here on an
undercover assignment,

157
00:14:10,933 --> 00:14:14,432
investigating hijacked
semis along the mass pike.

158
00:14:14,433 --> 00:14:17,332
Tons of merchandise
disappears every day.

159
00:14:17,333 --> 00:14:20,432
Refrigerators, TVs, VCRs,
clothes, you name it.

160
00:14:20,433 --> 00:14:22,933
In any event, the feds
have asked for our help.

161
00:14:22,968 --> 00:14:26,293
- Who are you?
- I'm Ellis Franklin.

162
00:14:26,833 --> 00:14:30,632
- I've been sent up to replace Ned Mays.
- What happened to Mays?

163
00:14:30,633 --> 00:14:32,967
Same thing that happens to
everyone who can't deliver.

164
00:14:32,968 --> 00:14:36,032
- Transferred to Alabama.
- Lucky guy.

165
00:14:36,033 --> 00:14:39,032
Agent Wyatt's last reported
contact was at a gas station

166
00:14:39,033 --> 00:14:44,432
near the connecticut state
border. That was yesterday morning.

167
00:14:44,433 --> 00:14:48,433
- FBI, huh?
- Yeah. FBI.

168
00:14:48,533 --> 00:14:50,932
They sent over this photo. Check it out.

169
00:14:50,933 --> 00:14:53,167
Carbone and Wiley are downstairs
with a potential witness right now.

170
00:14:53,168 --> 00:14:55,432
I'd like you two to liaise with them,

171
00:14:55,433 --> 00:14:59,373
and if you come up
with anything, call me.

172
00:15:02,733 --> 00:15:04,432
Refrigerators.

173
00:15:04,433 --> 00:15:06,933
I killed that poor spook
over hot refrigerators?

174
00:15:06,968 --> 00:15:08,032
It looks like it.

175
00:15:08,033 --> 00:15:10,032
Fuck. You don't think
somebody saw us, did ya?

176
00:15:10,033 --> 00:15:11,967
- How the hell do I know?
- With all those goddamn trucks going by...

177
00:15:11,968 --> 00:15:14,034
- Do we have to talk about it?
- Somebody could've seen us.

178
00:15:14,035 --> 00:15:16,067
Do we always have to fucking
talk about everything? Do we?

179
00:15:16,068 --> 00:15:20,798
Can you shut up for once?
Is that too much to ask?

180
00:15:25,333 --> 00:15:28,532
Well, there was 2 cars.
They looked the same to me.

181
00:15:28,533 --> 00:15:32,632
Kind of dark-colored, uh, Sedans.
Like I said, I was on the highway

182
00:15:32,633 --> 00:15:34,632
about a quarter mile down the road.

183
00:15:34,633 --> 00:15:37,732
Mr. Sullivan, detectives
Giggs and Magno.

184
00:15:37,733 --> 00:15:40,032
Mr. sullivan here was taking
a little nap in his car

185
00:15:40,033 --> 00:15:44,432
on the side of the road last night,
and he was awakened by a noise.

186
00:15:44,433 --> 00:15:48,432
- Gunshots. Woke me right up.
- So, you heard a sound.

187
00:15:48,433 --> 00:15:52,732
- Yeah. then I sat up and saw a flash.
- You saw the flash after the sound.

188
00:15:52,733 --> 00:15:58,332
- Well, there was more than one flash.
- You definitely saw a man fire a gun?

189
00:15:58,333 --> 00:16:01,332
Like I said, I was about a
quarter of a mile down the road.

190
00:16:01,333 --> 00:16:06,032
Couldn't see much of anything,
but... Yeah. I saw a guy fire a gun.

191
00:16:06,033 --> 00:16:09,467
And why did you stop there, Mr.
Sullivan? You were so close to home.

192
00:16:09,468 --> 00:16:12,532
I had a long day. I sell vacuums.

193
00:16:12,533 --> 00:16:16,067
I cover the whole state. I must've
put 300 miles on my car that day.

194
00:16:16,068 --> 00:16:19,432
- I was tired.
- And had you been drinking?

195
00:16:19,433 --> 00:16:24,167
Well, uh, I had dinner with a
friend down on Kingston, and...

196
00:16:24,168 --> 00:16:28,333
- Yeah, I had a cocktail.
- Just one?

197
00:16:28,433 --> 00:16:30,232
Maybe a couple.

198
00:16:30,233 --> 00:16:34,232
Well, which is it, Mr.
Sullivan? One? A couple?

199
00:16:34,233 --> 00:16:36,432
- I don't know.
- You don't know.

200
00:16:36,433 --> 00:16:41,693
Why don't you just start by
telling us what you do know.

201
00:17:05,133 --> 00:17:08,033
Take a bigger hit than that.

202
00:17:12,033 --> 00:17:15,032
This is pretty good
stuff. Where'd you get it?

203
00:17:15,033 --> 00:17:17,533
A friend.

204
00:17:18,133 --> 00:17:21,543
I didn't know you smoked, Mary Rose.

205
00:17:22,233 --> 00:17:27,232
- I bet your dad doesn't know.
- Why? Are you gonna tell him?

206
00:17:27,233 --> 00:17:29,733
Just after I tell my dad.

207
00:17:41,933 --> 00:17:44,433
Hello.

208
00:17:51,033 --> 00:17:53,867
You thieves figuring out how
to divide up the weekly take

209
00:17:53,868 --> 00:17:55,332
or just trading horses?

210
00:17:55,333 --> 00:17:57,367
Hey, Tommy. How's it
going? How's eileen?

211
00:17:57,368 --> 00:18:00,132
- Ah, we're squeaking by.
- Davey.

212
00:18:00,133 --> 00:18:02,532
Listen, I'll see you at
Sunday church, Maureen.

213
00:18:02,533 --> 00:18:05,233
I seriously doubt that, Tommy.

214
00:18:09,433 --> 00:18:13,232
- Buy you a beer, representative?
- Thanks for the thought,

215
00:18:13,233 --> 00:18:15,532
but we've been waiting 3
months to get on the docket.

216
00:18:15,533 --> 00:18:18,417
- We're not going anywhere.
- 3 months. That's a long time.

217
00:18:18,418 --> 00:18:23,432
- Care to tell me what the problem is?
- My problem is them.

218
00:18:23,433 --> 00:18:25,632
Reverend Westlake's parishioners
have generously raised

219
00:18:25,633 --> 00:18:28,632
a substantial amount of
money to build a new church.

220
00:18:28,633 --> 00:18:33,032
But without zoning board approval,
they can't close escrow on the land.

221
00:18:33,033 --> 00:18:35,533
Who did you offend?

222
00:18:36,433 --> 00:18:38,898
Mr. Manfredo and Mr. Vieria

223
00:18:38,933 --> 00:18:41,967
are upset about the proximity
of the proposed church

224
00:18:41,968 --> 00:18:44,932
to their neighborhood on the Hill.

225
00:18:44,933 --> 00:18:47,832
Your celtic compatriots have
chosen to side with them.

226
00:18:47,833 --> 00:18:50,632
Oh, don't worry too much about
Davey and Mrs. Downing, Jerry.

227
00:18:50,633 --> 00:18:52,132
They're not bad people.

228
00:18:52,133 --> 00:18:54,932
They just need a little
help to see the light.

229
00:18:54,933 --> 00:18:59,832
Do you have a real estate
agent representing the purchase?

230
00:18:59,833 --> 00:19:05,032
- Why would I need an agent?
- Everyone needs an agent, Reverend,

231
00:19:05,033 --> 00:19:07,332
to grease the wheels.

232
00:19:07,333 --> 00:19:13,903
Mr. Caffee here is himself an excellent
and fully licensed wheel greaser.

233
00:19:14,033 --> 00:19:16,533
Tommy Caffee.

234
00:19:34,833 --> 00:19:37,533
Hey. Beer?

235
00:19:37,633 --> 00:19:42,132
I went back to the warehouse.
the one in pawtucket?

236
00:19:42,133 --> 00:19:44,532
Why?

237
00:19:44,533 --> 00:19:49,833
Gee, I don't know. Investigating?

238
00:19:49,933 --> 00:19:54,033
- You find anything?
- Oh, yeah.

239
00:19:54,133 --> 00:19:58,223
Copiers, construction
equipment, refrigerators.

240
00:19:59,533 --> 00:20:04,963
2 whole floors of stolen goods.
Fucking Michael Caffee, huh?

241
00:20:05,933 --> 00:20:11,832
Oh, he's definitely up to something.
He may not be selling drugs,

242
00:20:11,833 --> 00:20:15,332
But whatever it is, he's fucking rich.

243
00:20:15,333 --> 00:20:20,232
- Can't do shit about it now, can we?
- Because of me?

244
00:20:20,233 --> 00:20:22,833
Yeah, because of you.

245
00:20:22,933 --> 00:20:26,232
Well, if that isn't the pot
calling the kettle black.

246
00:20:26,233 --> 00:20:30,632
- What the fuck is that supposed to
mean? Dina Finnerty. Slow Charlie.

247
00:20:30,633 --> 00:20:32,932
You really put the screws to your
pal Mike Caffee there, didn't you?

248
00:20:32,933 --> 00:20:35,067
Completely fucking different
situation, and you know it.

249
00:20:35,068 --> 00:20:37,432
- Fuck you.
- You know what?

250
00:20:37,433 --> 00:20:40,767
You compromised our fucking
friendship. You took advantage of me.

251
00:20:40,768 --> 00:20:42,732
You turned me into your
silent fucking partner.

252
00:20:42,733 --> 00:20:45,617
You shot an unarmed law
enforcement agent. What the fuck?

253
00:20:45,618 --> 00:20:48,532
I was doing my fucking job,
trying to protect the both of us.

254
00:20:48,533 --> 00:20:54,883
Well, now we're both in bed with
Michael Caffee, thank you very much.

255
00:21:11,133 --> 00:21:13,633
Mary Rose, is that you?

256
00:21:18,433 --> 00:21:20,732
You girls have got to
take care of that cat.

257
00:21:20,733 --> 00:21:22,832
- What's wrong with it?
- It's out of control.

258
00:21:22,833 --> 00:21:27,332
- You promised you'd take care of it.
- I've been at school all day.

259
00:21:27,333 --> 00:21:29,932
I've got more to do with my day

260
00:21:29,933 --> 00:21:31,332
than spend it running
around after a cat.

261
00:21:31,333 --> 00:21:37,532
- What are you doing? - I'm hungry. -
Supper's in an hour. - I'm hungry now.

262
00:21:37,533 --> 00:21:42,693
- How about feeding the cat?
- Did you buy any cat food?

263
00:21:44,133 --> 00:21:47,432
- No.
- Then how am I supposed to feed it?

264
00:21:47,433 --> 00:21:51,232
Call your dad and tell him
to pick up some cat food.

265
00:21:51,233 --> 00:21:55,933
- Oh, he's gonna love that.
- Too bad.

266
00:21:57,833 --> 00:22:02,032
Just what were you doing all
day that you were so busy?

267
00:22:02,033 --> 00:22:05,333
- Set the table.
- Whatever.

268
00:22:05,368 --> 00:22:08,633
And don't use that tone with me.

269
00:22:12,233 --> 00:22:15,533
- Hello. Hey.
- Hey, it's me.

270
00:22:15,633 --> 00:22:17,232
What do you say I take
you to dinner tonight?

271
00:22:17,233 --> 00:22:21,732
- Lobster and martinis.
- What are you so happy about?

272
00:22:21,733 --> 00:22:24,643
- I made a sale today.
- Great.

273
00:22:24,833 --> 00:22:27,132
I'm gonna be able to
pay your dad back, too.

274
00:22:27,133 --> 00:22:31,267
Huh. well, I got kids to feed
and help with their homework,

275
00:22:31,268 --> 00:22:32,732
plus I got bills to pay,

276
00:22:32,733 --> 00:22:34,732
and plus I got a cat
clawing up the furniture.

277
00:22:34,733 --> 00:22:39,732
- So tonight's not a good night.
- Ok. I'll sse you later, I guess.

278
00:22:39,733 --> 00:22:43,383
Tommy. Would you pick up some cat food?

279
00:22:45,333 --> 00:22:47,833
- Sure.
- Thanks.

280
00:22:53,533 --> 00:22:56,767
And then there's the O'Neal funeral,
tomorrow at 9:00. Did you know her?

281
00:22:56,768 --> 00:22:59,433
- Who?
- Molly O'Neal.

282
00:22:59,533 --> 00:23:01,998
Yeah. She was a bingo
friend of my mother's.

283
00:23:02,033 --> 00:23:06,843
Then you probably ought
to go. Ah, it's after 7:00.

284
00:23:07,233 --> 00:23:09,967
You want me to call Eileen,
tell her you're on your way?

285
00:23:09,968 --> 00:23:12,468
- No.
- No?

286
00:23:15,333 --> 00:23:19,803
I'm gonna have another
drink. You wanna join me?

287
00:23:19,933 --> 00:23:22,132
Sure. Scott's in New York tonight.

288
00:23:22,133 --> 00:23:24,598
Just me and that spoiled
maltese bitch of his.

289
00:23:24,633 --> 00:23:29,732
- Hmm. we got a cat. I hate cats.
- Hello. Kevin, two. Another round.

290
00:23:29,733 --> 00:23:33,532
Yeah, Scott thinks the
dog's good practice for us.

291
00:23:33,533 --> 00:23:36,033
What, are you two
thinking about having kids?

292
00:23:36,068 --> 00:23:37,732
Hmm... huh?

293
00:23:37,733 --> 00:23:41,532
Well, someday. But
why spoil a good thing?

294
00:23:41,533 --> 00:23:45,053
- Kids are great.
- So is sex. - Yeah.

295
00:23:47,333 --> 00:23:50,632
Thank you. How long have
you guys been together?

296
00:23:50,633 --> 00:23:54,333
- 4 years.
- You're amateurs.

297
00:23:54,433 --> 00:23:56,767
Well, it's the longest relationship
either of us has ever had.

298
00:23:56,768 --> 00:23:59,667
Well, I wish you luck,
my friend. I really do.

299
00:23:59,668 --> 00:24:02,168
Thank you.

300
00:24:10,933 --> 00:24:14,633
Ow! Ow! Stop it.

301
00:24:32,133 --> 00:24:35,433
Oh! Goddamn it. Shit.

302
00:24:35,533 --> 00:24:38,033
Fucking cat.

303
00:25:55,433 --> 00:25:59,033
Mommy! Mommy! Mom! Mom! Mommy!

304
00:25:59,068 --> 00:26:00,232
Mommy!

305
00:26:00,233 --> 00:26:02,832
Rusty's gone! Mom, Rusty's gone!

306
00:26:02,833 --> 00:26:06,732
I was gonna feed her,
but we couldn't find her.

307
00:26:06,733 --> 00:26:10,233
- Oh, god.
- We looked everywhere.

308
00:26:10,333 --> 00:26:15,973
She's probably just sleeping
somewhere. You know how cats are.

309
00:26:20,233 --> 00:26:22,733
Mike, we got to find a
new place to bury people.

310
00:26:22,768 --> 00:26:25,432
We've run out of room
under the overpass.

311
00:26:25,433 --> 00:26:28,732
Anyway, they got all
this oil down there.

312
00:26:28,733 --> 00:26:30,732
It causes cancer, you know.

313
00:26:30,733 --> 00:26:33,367
That's all I could think about
when I was digging the fucking hole.

314
00:26:33,368 --> 00:26:35,632
- Am I gonna get cancer?
- Absolutely not.

315
00:26:35,633 --> 00:26:41,243
You're gonna die of something
else way before you get cancer.

316
00:26:41,533 --> 00:26:45,732
- Is that Sean? - Yeah.
- How's he working out?

317
00:26:45,733 --> 00:26:50,032
- He's not one of our best.
- Teach him a lesson?

318
00:26:50,033 --> 00:26:52,517
No. I gave him a warning. He's only 12.

319
00:26:52,518 --> 00:26:54,932
Hey, it's the young
ones you got to watch.

320
00:26:54,933 --> 00:26:59,532
Those cocks, they got no
fear. Remember us back then?

321
00:26:59,533 --> 00:27:02,532
- What is this, dover?
- Yeah. who's that?

322
00:27:02,533 --> 00:27:05,943
That's got to be Willie. What the...

323
00:27:21,533 --> 00:27:24,033
Mary Rose?

324
00:27:25,833 --> 00:27:28,633
Get in the car and wait there.

325
00:27:29,833 --> 00:27:33,373
- What'd I tell you? Huh?
- She's 16.

326
00:27:35,233 --> 00:27:39,043
That was my 13-year-old
niece, fuckstain.

327
00:27:46,033 --> 00:27:50,733
Get out. Get out the car.

328
00:28:15,833 --> 00:28:18,333
Rusty.

329
00:28:19,133 --> 00:28:22,633
Here, kitty, kitty. Rusty.

330
00:28:22,733 --> 00:28:25,233
Here, kitty, kitty.

331
00:28:33,633 --> 00:28:38,763
- Sit down. - I'm not hungry.
- I didn't ask. Sit down.

332
00:28:44,033 --> 00:28:46,933
2 number 4s, 2 waters.

333
00:28:48,933 --> 00:28:51,433
What?

334
00:28:51,833 --> 00:28:54,333
- Are you stupid?
- No.

335
00:28:56,033 --> 00:29:01,233
'Cause only stupid people
do drugs. Stupid and weak.

336
00:29:04,733 --> 00:29:10,733
I don't think of you as stupid,
and you never struck me as weak.

337
00:29:14,333 --> 00:29:16,833
So... what's going on?

338
00:29:20,833 --> 00:29:23,333
2 number 4s.

339
00:29:24,933 --> 00:29:27,332
George says they're on the house.

340
00:29:27,333 --> 00:29:32,043
That's very thoughtful of
him. Thank George for us.

341
00:29:35,433 --> 00:29:37,933
Are you gonna tell dad?

342
00:29:38,533 --> 00:29:42,233
- Why? You think I should?
- No.

343
00:29:43,633 --> 00:29:46,133
No?

344
00:29:54,333 --> 00:29:58,833
You're a Caffee. Caffees don't do drugs.

345
00:29:58,933 --> 00:30:01,433
You understand?

346
00:30:04,733 --> 00:30:08,132
- All right, eat up.
- I don't like stuffies.

347
00:30:08,133 --> 00:30:10,633
Taste it.

348
00:30:22,833 --> 00:30:25,933
Mmm. Not bad, huh?

349
00:30:28,733 --> 00:30:31,233
You're a Caffee all right.

350
00:30:35,833 --> 00:30:38,333
Mmm.

351
00:30:44,733 --> 00:30:47,732
Ok, I'll let you out here so
your mother doesn't see us.

352
00:30:47,733 --> 00:30:49,432
Thanks.

353
00:30:49,433 --> 00:30:52,632
It's all right. I don't
think she approves of me.

354
00:30:52,633 --> 00:30:55,133
She doesn't.

355
00:30:57,133 --> 00:31:01,432
Mary Rose. I know a lot
of people around here.

356
00:31:01,433 --> 00:31:05,832
Nothing happens on this hill that
I don't find out about eventually.

357
00:31:05,833 --> 00:31:09,932
If you ever try to buy
so much as a cigarette,

358
00:31:09,933 --> 00:31:14,232
you don't wanna know what
I'll do. You understand?

359
00:31:14,233 --> 00:31:16,733
Ok.

360
00:31:34,733 --> 00:31:38,432
They found Wyatt's car. The
plates had been switched,

361
00:31:38,433 --> 00:31:41,032
- but they matched the vin number.
- Yeah?

362
00:31:41,033 --> 00:31:45,132
Abandoned at Logan
airport with a body inside.

363
00:31:45,133 --> 00:31:47,232
It's not our guy, though,

364
00:31:47,233 --> 00:31:50,232
so I guess this is
Boston P.D.'s problem now.

365
00:31:50,233 --> 00:31:55,573
I need you two back on Freddie
Cork. keep me in the loop.

366
00:32:02,533 --> 00:32:05,033
Fucking Michael Caffee.

367
00:32:05,633 --> 00:32:09,433
- Fuck.
- Yeah.

368
00:32:19,033 --> 00:32:22,933
Hey, Decco. Dater.

369
00:32:31,233 --> 00:32:32,532
Listen.

370
00:32:32,533 --> 00:32:36,632
I don't expect any
special treatment from you.

371
00:32:36,633 --> 00:32:38,132
Your job's your job.

372
00:32:38,133 --> 00:32:41,232
You got to do what you got
to do. I understand that.

373
00:32:41,233 --> 00:32:43,733
I respect that.

374
00:32:45,333 --> 00:32:47,532
Just 'cause I did you guys a favor,

375
00:32:47,533 --> 00:32:51,343
I would never ask for
anything in return.

376
00:32:52,433 --> 00:32:55,893
As far as I'm concerned, we're even.

377
00:33:01,333 --> 00:33:06,523
You know, silence is argument
carried out by other means.

378
00:33:17,633 --> 00:33:19,132
Tommy.

379
00:33:19,133 --> 00:33:22,932
Norman, I hope I didn't pull
you from anything too important.

380
00:33:22,933 --> 00:33:26,833
- No. Not at all.
- Here. Uh...

381
00:33:26,933 --> 00:33:29,832
- What's this?
- That's a check for $15,000.

382
00:33:29,833 --> 00:33:31,832
I thought you said
you needed this money.

383
00:33:31,833 --> 00:33:36,232
- Not anymore. I, uh, made a sale.
- That was fast.

384
00:33:36,233 --> 00:33:38,432
I got an advance on my broker's fee.

385
00:33:38,433 --> 00:33:40,967
I told you you didn't need
to pay me back right away.

386
00:33:40,968 --> 00:33:42,232
I wanted to.

387
00:33:42,233 --> 00:33:44,733
Look, Tommy, about
dinner the other night...

388
00:33:44,768 --> 00:33:48,533
Norman, it's... Listen, I got to run.

389
00:33:48,633 --> 00:33:52,832
I got a corporation's committee
meeting starting in 20 minutes.

390
00:33:52,833 --> 00:33:54,867
- But thanks again, huh?
- All right, Tommy.

391
00:33:54,868 --> 00:33:57,858
- We'll speak soon.
- Take care.

392
00:34:11,633 --> 00:34:13,967
Mary, hold on a second.
Hold on a second.

393
00:34:13,968 --> 00:34:16,833
Hey, Mike! Mike!

394
00:34:16,933 --> 00:34:21,133
- What?
- There's somebody here to see you.

395
00:34:26,433 --> 00:34:30,432
Mary Rose, what you doing
here? You should be in school.

396
00:34:30,433 --> 00:34:33,632
- School's boring.
- Of course it's boring. It's school.

397
00:34:33,633 --> 00:34:39,823
- It's important. You got to learn.
- I'd rather hang out with you.

398
00:34:40,433 --> 00:34:42,933
Wanna hang with me.

399
00:34:44,633 --> 00:34:47,133
I don't think so. Come on.

400
00:34:47,233 --> 00:34:51,732
Let's get you to school before
they catch you playing hooky.

401
00:34:51,733 --> 00:34:54,233
Come on. Let's move.

402
00:35:01,533 --> 00:35:05,132
All right. If you have
nothing to do after school,

403
00:35:05,133 --> 00:35:08,832
Why don't you come back. You
can work the cash register.

404
00:35:08,833 --> 00:35:13,413
It'll teach you something
about people. All right?

405
00:35:17,833 --> 00:35:20,333
Ok.

406
00:35:23,033 --> 00:35:26,893
You know her daddy's
not gonna like that.

407
00:35:38,633 --> 00:35:41,443
- My fucking register.
- Rusty!

408
00:35:41,633 --> 00:35:45,032
Rusty! Here, kitty,
kitty, kitty! Here, girl!

409
00:35:45,033 --> 00:35:47,067
Girls, I don't think he
would've made it this far.

410
00:35:47,068 --> 00:35:51,333
He might have. Rusty! Rusty! here, girl.

411
00:35:51,433 --> 00:35:54,367
I have an idea. Why don't we go
home and we'll make some signs.

412
00:35:54,368 --> 00:35:58,048
- I'll hang 'em up tomorrow.
- Tomorrow?

413
00:35:58,133 --> 00:35:59,532
Rusty!

414
00:35:59,533 --> 00:36:04,423
Why don't we go get some
ice cream after dinner, ok?

415
00:37:17,333 --> 00:37:20,933
Come here, Rusty. Where are you? Rusty.

416
00:37:23,333 --> 00:37:25,833
Where the fuck are you?

417
00:37:28,233 --> 00:37:31,513
Goddamn it. Where the fuck are you?

418
00:38:33,833 --> 00:38:36,333
Hello.

419
00:38:36,933 --> 00:38:39,433
What?

420
00:38:39,633 --> 00:38:42,133
Hang on.

421
00:38:53,633 --> 00:38:55,732
It's standard procedure.

422
00:38:55,733 --> 00:38:58,732
- But she passed the breathalyzer.
- I want her released.

423
00:38:58,733 --> 00:39:01,433
Mr. Caffee, she was erratic.

424
00:39:01,533 --> 00:39:04,632
You know, we lost a
cat. Kids are a mess.

425
00:39:04,633 --> 00:39:06,832
That's why she's running in the woods

426
00:39:06,833 --> 00:39:11,032
at 2:00 in the morning,
barefoot, in her nightclothes?

427
00:39:11,033 --> 00:39:15,713
No. She got scared of you
guys. Can you blame her?

428
00:39:23,033 --> 00:39:25,833
Yeah, listen, Alex. It's me.

429
00:39:25,933 --> 00:39:29,332
Get me the scituate chief
of police on the phone.

430
00:39:29,333 --> 00:39:34,413
No, no. It's fine. It's just
a little misunderstanding.

431
00:40:09,933 --> 00:40:14,113
How did the girls'
kitten end up in scituate?

432
00:40:14,533 --> 00:40:17,932
- Because I dumped her there.
- You what?

433
00:40:17,933 --> 00:40:21,853
- She was driving me crazy, ok?
- Eileen...

434
00:40:23,633 --> 00:40:28,473
What's the matter? Come
on. Just... What's going on?

435
00:40:30,433 --> 00:40:35,532
- Talk to me, please. Just...
- What's the matter? - Yeah.

436
00:40:35,533 --> 00:40:40,553
I'll tell you what's going
on. I'm a horrible person.

437
00:40:40,733 --> 00:40:44,632
A cat killer. Lock me up
and throw away the key.

438
00:40:44,633 --> 00:40:49,533
What can I say? Sometimes
people do irrational things.

439
00:40:50,033 --> 00:40:52,533
Are you on something?

440
00:40:53,433 --> 00:40:55,933
Oh, Tommy, come on.

441
00:40:59,333 --> 00:41:01,833
No. I wasn't on anything.

442
00:41:24,933 --> 00:41:30,098
Here's your coat. Mary
Rose, here's your coat.

443
00:41:30,133 --> 00:41:35,233
Ok, Noni, you have ballet
today. Leotard's in there.

444
00:41:35,333 --> 00:41:38,167
Lila, your permission
slip's in the back pocket.

445
00:41:38,168 --> 00:41:42,333
Ok, bus is here. I love you.

446
00:42:05,233 --> 00:42:07,823
I ironed your shirt for you.
