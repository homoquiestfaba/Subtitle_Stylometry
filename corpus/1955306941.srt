1
00:00:35,268 --> 00:00:36,497
<i>This morning...</i>

2
00:00:38,872 --> 00:00:40,534
<i>...I found a feather in the gutter.</i>

3
00:00:42,442 --> 00:00:46,504
<i>It was worn.</i>
<i>It was tattered, seemingly worthless.</i>

4
00:00:48,681 --> 00:00:50,479
<i>But I thought to myself...</i>

5
00:00:51,451 --> 00:00:53,215
<i>...on the wing of an eagle,</i>

6
00:00:53,319 --> 00:00:57,381
<i>a feather like this can soar</i>
<i>high above the trees,</i>

7
00:00:57,490 --> 00:01:00,324
<i>over snow-capped mountains,</i>
<i>rushing rivers.</i>

8
00:01:03,163 --> 00:01:04,927
I don't get it, man.

9
00:01:05,031 --> 00:01:07,796
You know, everyone runs around,
looking for things they don't have.

10
00:01:09,436 --> 00:01:10,699
Most times, it's...

11
00:01:14,441 --> 00:01:15,909
It's right in front of their eyes.

12
00:01:20,013 --> 00:01:21,743
See now...

13
00:01:21,848 --> 00:01:24,317
Now, take this for example, right?

14
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:29,313
Don't mind if I do.

15
00:01:31,124 --> 00:01:32,114
Now, look at this now.

16
00:01:32,225 --> 00:01:35,252
<i>In Shakespeare's hand,</i>
<i>a feather dipped in a bit of ink</i>

17
00:01:35,361 --> 00:01:39,662
<i>gave us the world's</i>
<i>most beautiful, wonderful stories.</i>

18
00:01:39,766 --> 00:01:41,792
Now see, who'd throw
something this awesome away?

19
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:45,229
Not you or me.

20
00:01:49,309 --> 00:01:52,143
Not enough comfort in the world
as it is if you ask me.

21
00:01:57,450 --> 00:01:59,180
What else have we got in here?

22
00:02:00,453 --> 00:02:01,819
What are you doing?

23
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:06,987
I was just minding
my own business, Officer.

24
00:02:07,093 --> 00:02:10,325
<i>A paint brush in my hands might be good</i>
<i>for painting the house,</i>

25
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:12,729
<i>but a paint brush</i>
<i>in Michelangelo's hands...</i>

26
00:02:12,832 --> 00:02:14,266
- All right.
<i>- ...the Sistine Chapel.</i>

27
00:02:14,367 --> 00:02:17,201
Have some breakfast, friend. Here.

28
00:02:21,474 --> 00:02:23,636
- Do me a favor.
- Yes, sir?

29
00:02:23,743 --> 00:02:25,939
Stay out of trouble, all right?

30
00:02:26,045 --> 00:02:28,173
I don't want to have to haul you in again.

31
00:02:30,016 --> 00:02:31,416
Anything you say, sir.

32
00:02:33,186 --> 00:02:34,950
- Thank you.
- Okay.

33
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:42,360
<i>Hand me a violin...</i>
<i>Friends, you would run for the hills.</i>

34
00:02:42,462 --> 00:02:47,400
<i>But a violin in the hands</i>
<i>of Itzhak Perlman, priceless.</i>

35
00:02:48,134 --> 00:02:49,796
Got by that time.

36
00:02:50,837 --> 00:02:55,172
<i>Two fish and five loaves in my hands,</i>
<i>not very much.</i>

37
00:02:55,275 --> 00:03:00,873
Two fish and five loaves
in the Lord's hands can feed thousands.

38
00:03:01,915 --> 00:03:07,650
Friends, things and people
only take on their full value

39
00:03:07,754 --> 00:03:10,690
when they are placed in the right hands.

40
00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:13,589
Are you willing to give your life to God

41
00:03:13,693 --> 00:03:16,288
so that he can use you for his purpose?

42
00:03:17,697 --> 00:03:21,566
The Bible tells us he took the five loaves
and the two fish.

43
00:03:21,668 --> 00:03:24,570
He looked up to heaven,
and he gave thanks.

44
00:03:24,671 --> 00:03:28,039
He blessed the food, he broke the loaves,

45
00:03:28,141 --> 00:03:30,576
he gave them to his disciples
to set before them,

46
00:03:30,677 --> 00:03:34,307
and the two fish,
he divided among them all.

47
00:03:35,982 --> 00:03:37,541
It was a miracle that day.

48
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:42,520
Friends, all is made good through God.

49
00:03:42,622 --> 00:03:45,956
You can choose to live your life
on your own,

50
00:03:46,059 --> 00:03:50,224
never asking for help,
never asking for guidance.

51
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:53,533
Or you can give your life to God

52
00:03:53,633 --> 00:03:57,468
and discover all the wondrous things
that he has planned for you...

53
00:03:58,538 --> 00:04:01,269
...all the wonderful things he has planned

54
00:04:01,374 --> 00:04:03,343
for each and every one of you.

55
00:04:03,443 --> 00:04:05,139
Can I get an "amen"?

56
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:07,146
- Yes!
- Amen!

57
00:04:09,115 --> 00:04:10,378
Don't be so obvious.

58
00:04:17,890 --> 00:04:19,119
Thank you for coming.

59
00:04:19,225 --> 00:04:20,420
Thank you so much.

60
00:04:20,526 --> 00:04:22,825
- Hey, hey, thank you, Meredith.
- Thanks, Reverend.

61
00:04:22,929 --> 00:04:23,919
Meredith, thank you.

62
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:26,499
Hi. Hi, Lori.
Thank you for coming.

63
00:04:27,667 --> 00:04:30,193
Tim, good to see you.
Keep coming back.

64
00:04:30,303 --> 00:04:33,467
Hey, kids! You too busy
to talk to your dad?

65
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:35,733
Great sermon, Dad.

66
00:04:35,842 --> 00:04:36,969
Thank you. Did you really like it?

67
00:04:37,076 --> 00:04:40,444
Because I think that
I touched the congregation today

68
00:04:40,546 --> 00:04:42,344
on many different levels.

69
00:04:43,182 --> 00:04:44,616
I wasn't really listening.

70
00:04:46,919 --> 00:04:50,321
Well, please, tell me
that you got something out of my sermon.

71
00:04:50,423 --> 00:04:52,756
I'm hungry. Does that count?

72
00:04:52,859 --> 00:04:55,055
I was thinking fish tacos.

73
00:04:55,161 --> 00:04:57,790
Look, I was thinking that we could spend
this afternoon as a family.

74
00:04:57,897 --> 00:05:00,366
We can go to the movies.
Maybe go to the museum.

75
00:05:00,466 --> 00:05:01,866
Well, actually, Peter's got

76
00:05:01,968 --> 00:05:04,836
some video game convention thing
that he's going to,

77
00:05:04,937 --> 00:05:08,897
and Chrissy's working pet adoptions down
at the animal shelter.

78
00:05:09,008 --> 00:05:10,772
You know, I worry
about that kid sometimes.

79
00:05:10,877 --> 00:05:12,743
She's got such a tough exterior, you know,

80
00:05:12,845 --> 00:05:16,748
but I know she's falling in love with
each and every one of those rescue dogs.

81
00:05:16,849 --> 00:05:19,318
- Sweetheart, I...
- I know.

82
00:05:19,419 --> 00:05:20,580
I'm sorry.

83
00:05:20,687 --> 00:05:23,851
I got a mani-pedi appointment.
Then I'm getting my roots done.

84
00:05:23,956 --> 00:05:26,391
- I'll see you later.
- Okay, honey.

85
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:30,820
Brian Johnson wants to see you
in his office.

86
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:32,262
Thank you.

87
00:05:35,702 --> 00:05:36,761
Closing?

88
00:05:38,604 --> 00:05:42,234
There simply aren't enough members
to sustain this parish any longer.

89
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:44,607
The neighborhood? Mostly businesses.

90
00:05:44,711 --> 00:05:46,907
The families have all moved out.

91
00:05:47,013 --> 00:05:48,345
Now, you've done an admirable job

92
00:05:48,448 --> 00:05:51,213
holding this church together
with such limited resources, but...

93
00:05:51,317 --> 00:05:52,808
Look, I know, okay?

94
00:05:52,919 --> 00:05:54,581
We didn't get enough funds
to get a new roof,

95
00:05:54,687 --> 00:05:56,212
but that's no reason to close the church.

96
00:05:56,322 --> 00:05:58,120
The building is falling apart around you.

97
00:05:58,224 --> 00:06:02,025
The congregation will be invited
to join the church at Saint Mark's.

98
00:06:08,034 --> 00:06:09,468
You're being reassigned.

99
00:06:10,603 --> 00:06:13,334
- Eufala.
- Yes, I follow.

100
00:06:13,439 --> 00:06:14,930
No, no, no, no.

101
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:17,601
That is the name of the town.

102
00:06:18,611 --> 00:06:19,579
Arizona.

103
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:22,543
Eufala, Arizona.

104
00:06:22,648 --> 00:06:24,412
I want to talk to you about...

105
00:06:25,685 --> 00:06:26,948
...an opportunity.

106
00:06:27,053 --> 00:06:29,648
Now, just hear me out
before you say anything,

107
00:06:29,756 --> 00:06:32,658
because this is not something
that I sought out,

108
00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:36,924
but it is... something
that I think that we should consider.

109
00:06:37,029 --> 00:06:38,520
Just tell her what's in your heart.

110
00:06:38,631 --> 00:06:42,568
She's stood behind your decisions
in the past, hasn't she?

111
00:06:44,170 --> 00:06:45,695
She's got your back, man.

112
00:06:45,805 --> 00:06:46,966
I'm sorry.

113
00:06:48,307 --> 00:06:49,536
Have I seen you before?

114
00:06:49,642 --> 00:06:52,043
Me? Well...

115
00:06:53,913 --> 00:06:56,439
Me, I've always been here.

116
00:06:56,549 --> 00:06:58,177
And you just haven't noticed.

117
00:06:59,318 --> 00:07:00,445
I don't mind.

118
00:07:00,553 --> 00:07:03,387
And you have an opinion
that you want to share with me.

119
00:07:09,896 --> 00:07:11,990
Now, the way I see it...

120
00:07:12,098 --> 00:07:14,829
Now, if you truly believe in something,

121
00:07:14,934 --> 00:07:17,096
trust in that with all your soul.

122
00:07:17,203 --> 00:07:20,139
Well, with all due respect, Mister...

123
00:07:20,239 --> 00:07:21,673
DeAngelis.

124
00:07:21,774 --> 00:07:23,868
- Hi.
- Rain DeAngelis.

125
00:07:25,144 --> 00:07:32,051
You know, like the cleansing drops
that fall from the heavens.

126
00:07:33,586 --> 00:07:35,680
Mr. DeAngelis, with all due respect,

127
00:07:35,788 --> 00:07:36,949
you couldn't possibly know

128
00:07:37,056 --> 00:07:40,026
what I'm going to have
to go through right now.

129
00:07:40,126 --> 00:07:43,995
Now, you've got to convince your family
to do something,

130
00:07:44,096 --> 00:07:46,759
something you haven't quite
convinced yourself about,

131
00:07:46,866 --> 00:07:50,803
even though you know in your heart
it's the right thing to do.

132
00:07:50,903 --> 00:07:52,895
You know how they say
when God closes a door,

133
00:07:53,005 --> 00:07:55,133
- he opens a window?
- Yeah.

134
00:07:55,241 --> 00:07:58,109
Well, you could just wait
for that window to open,

135
00:07:58,211 --> 00:07:59,577
or you could...

136
00:07:59,679 --> 00:08:03,241
So you're saying that
this could be God's plan for my family?

137
00:08:03,349 --> 00:08:06,786
All I'm saying is,
you could just open the door.

138
00:08:08,454 --> 00:08:10,047
That's how doors work.

139
00:08:22,101 --> 00:08:23,626
Thanks.

140
00:08:31,677 --> 00:08:34,374
- Hi, Chrissy.
- Hi, Dad.

141
00:08:35,181 --> 00:08:36,774
<i>What if I don't want to go to Eufala?</i>

142
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:39,182
<i>What then?</i>

143
00:08:46,192 --> 00:08:48,593
So there's this new game
called <i>Cliff Hanger,</i> and it's super...

144
00:08:48,694 --> 00:08:50,287
Well, that's interesting, honey.

145
00:08:50,396 --> 00:08:53,127
Mom, it's more than just interesting.

146
00:08:53,232 --> 00:08:55,030
It's like the coolest game ever.

147
00:08:55,134 --> 00:08:57,194
I mean, you get to climb
all the highest mountains in the world,

148
00:08:57,303 --> 00:09:00,501
like Half Dome, Mount Whitney,
Kilimanjaro...

149
00:09:00,606 --> 00:09:01,733
Kilimanjaro?

150
00:09:02,675 --> 00:09:05,440
Honey, I don't know if I want
you doing something so dangerous.

151
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:08,310
Well, after each mountain,
you gain new skills for the next climb.

152
00:09:08,414 --> 00:09:10,542
Well... you know,
it sounds very dangerous.

153
00:09:10,650 --> 00:09:12,175
I think you should talk
to your father about it.

154
00:09:12,285 --> 00:09:14,550
It's not like
he's actually going outside or anything.

155
00:09:14,654 --> 00:09:15,883
Okay, who's talking to...

156
00:09:15,988 --> 00:09:17,547
What the... What...

157
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:19,718
What the heck is that?

158
00:09:19,825 --> 00:09:22,522
This is Yoda.

159
00:09:22,628 --> 00:09:23,891
I think it's a gremlin.

160
00:09:23,996 --> 00:09:25,259
What is it doing here?

161
00:09:25,364 --> 00:09:27,833
She was the only one not adopted today.

162
00:09:27,934 --> 00:09:30,460
- I can see why.
- Mom!

163
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:33,506
I couldn't bear the thought
of her going to the shelter alone.

164
00:09:33,606 --> 00:09:36,667
I think she's great. Can we keep her, Mom?

165
00:09:36,776 --> 00:09:40,543
Absolutely not.
You know this building doesn't allow pets.

166
00:09:40,646 --> 00:09:41,773
Come on.

167
00:09:49,789 --> 00:09:51,223
Little boo boo.

168
00:09:52,191 --> 00:09:53,591
Okay, maybe one night.

169
00:09:53,693 --> 00:09:56,595
Tomorrow you're going
back to the shelter.

170
00:09:56,696 --> 00:09:59,222
And she's staying in your room.
Your father can't know about this, okay?

171
00:10:00,366 --> 00:10:01,857
- Okay.
- Mary Louise.

172
00:10:01,968 --> 00:10:03,800
- Hiya, honey.
- Hey, sweetheart.

173
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:06,463
- Hi.
- I gotta talk to you.

174
00:10:06,572 --> 00:10:08,268
Can it wait?

175
00:10:08,374 --> 00:10:09,706
Just...

176
00:10:13,212 --> 00:10:15,875
There's... this church,

177
00:10:15,982 --> 00:10:18,679
and the pastor just retired.

178
00:10:18,784 --> 00:10:23,313
And I've been assigned
to help them find a permanent replacement.

179
00:10:23,422 --> 00:10:27,689
And it's just something
I feel that I have to do...

180
00:10:29,795 --> 00:10:32,162
...that we have to do,

181
00:10:32,264 --> 00:10:34,824
and I don't think there's a lot of choice.

182
00:10:34,934 --> 00:10:37,335
Well, there is a choice.

183
00:10:38,537 --> 00:10:41,200
Joey has been after you for years
to come work at the restaurant.

184
00:10:41,307 --> 00:10:44,937
Mary Louise, I have a calling, all right?

185
00:10:45,044 --> 00:10:46,774
And your brother
and I don't exactly get along.

186
00:10:46,879 --> 00:10:48,848
Nonsense.

187
00:10:48,948 --> 00:10:50,177
I mean, this is perfect, really.

188
00:10:50,282 --> 00:10:53,582
I mean, now you can finally be part
of the family business.

189
00:10:54,887 --> 00:10:56,822
And then on the weekends,
you can do God's work.

190
00:10:56,922 --> 00:10:59,357
I mean, it's win-win, honey.

191
00:11:00,693 --> 00:11:03,253
At least promise me you'll think about it.

192
00:11:03,362 --> 00:11:05,661
I mean, you know how much we love it here.

193
00:11:05,765 --> 00:11:08,530
All right, honey, I'll think about it.

194
00:11:08,634 --> 00:11:10,102
- Thank you.
- But on one condition.

195
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:14,629
If it doesn't work out, we go.
No complaints.

196
00:11:15,875 --> 00:11:17,605
Okay.

197
00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:19,303
Where is this place, anyway?

198
00:11:22,148 --> 00:11:23,411
Eufala.

199
00:11:24,917 --> 00:11:27,978
- What, we can't go with you?
- Eufala, Arizona.

200
00:11:33,092 --> 00:11:35,618
Breakfast is served.

201
00:11:35,728 --> 00:11:41,668
For our vegan option, we've got lentils
with broccoli, kale, and... tofu.

202
00:11:41,767 --> 00:11:44,498
Very, very delicious.

203
00:11:44,603 --> 00:11:46,663
Our protein breakfast
for you, young man,

204
00:11:46,772 --> 00:11:48,866
egg white frittata in a tomato sauce.

205
00:11:48,974 --> 00:11:51,773
Gluten free. Not too bad
if I do say so myself.

206
00:11:51,877 --> 00:11:54,403
You kids are taking that dog
back to the shelter this morning, right?

207
00:11:55,481 --> 00:11:57,109
Yeah.

208
00:11:57,216 --> 00:12:00,277
Good, 'cause we can't have your father
worrying about anything else today, okay?

209
00:12:03,222 --> 00:12:06,158
Well, we can't have Yoda going back
on an empty stomach, can we?

210
00:12:06,258 --> 00:12:08,386
- Thanks, Mom.
- Enjoy. Bon appétit.

211
00:12:13,132 --> 00:12:15,226
All right, honey.

212
00:12:15,334 --> 00:12:18,827
Honey, I made you
this lean, mean, delicious green shake.

213
00:12:18,938 --> 00:12:20,531
Come try it.
It's filled with antioxidants.

214
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:22,073
That's so nice, sweetheart,

215
00:12:22,174 --> 00:12:24,143
but I'm gonna catch something on the way,
because I'm late.

216
00:12:24,243 --> 00:12:28,078
I'm going to give it the old college try
with the pizza pie. Love you.

217
00:12:33,986 --> 00:12:36,012
All right. Well...

218
00:12:36,122 --> 00:12:39,024
Maybe we'll try something else.

219
00:12:44,897 --> 00:12:46,695
How many times I gotta tell you, Joe?

220
00:12:46,799 --> 00:12:50,395
Enough with that darn bell.
You don't have to ring it so many times.

221
00:12:50,503 --> 00:12:53,098
You don't have to yell on top of it, okay?
I can hear you.

222
00:12:53,205 --> 00:12:54,571
It's not going to make me move any faster.

223
00:12:54,673 --> 00:12:56,801
Yeah, like anything
could make you move quicker.

224
00:12:56,909 --> 00:12:58,138
I heard that.

225
00:13:02,748 --> 00:13:04,273
There he is!

226
00:13:06,852 --> 00:13:08,150
Hey, everybody, listen up.

227
00:13:08,254 --> 00:13:10,723
This here is my brother-in-law, Randy.

228
00:13:10,823 --> 00:13:13,725
- I knew you'd come around eventually.
- Yeah.

229
00:13:13,826 --> 00:13:15,385
It took Mary Louise
longer than we thought, huh?

230
00:13:15,494 --> 00:13:16,860
Longer than any of us thought, really.

231
00:13:16,962 --> 00:13:19,193
Yeah. Welcome
to our humble establishment, Reverend.

232
00:13:19,298 --> 00:13:20,960
Let me get you an apron
and get you all set up.

233
00:13:21,066 --> 00:13:23,365
Okay. Thanks, Tina.

234
00:13:23,469 --> 00:13:25,563
This was a mistake.

235
00:13:35,614 --> 00:13:37,014
Geez. What now?

236
00:13:37,116 --> 00:13:38,448
We're closed!

237
00:13:39,785 --> 00:13:41,310
Joey, just... Can I speak to him?

238
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:42,888
Don't go all soft on me.

239
00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:47,191
Hey. What are you doing here?

240
00:13:47,293 --> 00:13:48,852
What are you thinking, man?

241
00:13:52,498 --> 00:13:55,161
This isn't what
you're supposed to be doing.

242
00:13:55,267 --> 00:13:57,862
Now... you know that, right?

243
00:14:00,906 --> 00:14:02,135
I don't know anymore.

244
00:14:02,241 --> 00:14:03,903
Yes, Randy, yes, you do.

245
00:14:04,877 --> 00:14:06,869
It's just a different question this time.

246
00:14:09,548 --> 00:14:10,880
Doesn't change the answer.

247
00:14:12,117 --> 00:14:13,676
Wait. Wait.

248
00:14:13,786 --> 00:14:16,255
Let me get you something, okay?

249
00:14:16,355 --> 00:14:20,156
Joey, can I have a couple slices
for this gentleman, please?

250
00:14:20,259 --> 00:14:21,283
Here.

251
00:14:28,601 --> 00:14:30,069
False alarm.

252
00:14:37,109 --> 00:14:38,975
- Where are you going?
- Out.

253
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:42,275
I told you. You never listen.

254
00:14:42,381 --> 00:14:45,818
Me and your sister are going
to a book signing at the library.

255
00:14:45,918 --> 00:14:47,978
The library?

256
00:14:48,087 --> 00:14:49,851
So, you survive your first day?

257
00:14:49,955 --> 00:14:51,423
Yeah, Tina, thank you. Thank you.

258
00:14:51,523 --> 00:14:54,652
I really don't think
I would have made it without you.

259
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:56,126
Floor ain't going to mop itself, Reverend.

260
00:14:56,228 --> 00:14:57,423
Joey.

261
00:14:58,464 --> 00:15:02,367
- Get to work.
- Okay, brother-in-law of mine.

262
00:15:06,338 --> 00:15:08,500
Hey, Tina. Hey, honey.

263
00:15:08,607 --> 00:15:11,042
- Honey!
- How's it going?

264
00:15:11,143 --> 00:15:12,975
- Joey work you too hard?
- Whatever.

265
00:15:13,078 --> 00:15:14,637
- Come on. We're going to be late.
- Okay. Okay.

266
00:15:14,747 --> 00:15:17,307
Listen, there's a plate in the fridge.
All you gotta do is heat it up, okay?

267
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:18,406
I'll see you later.

268
00:15:20,519 --> 00:15:22,283
What? You forget something?

269
00:15:22,388 --> 00:15:24,357
No. Look at him.

270
00:15:25,824 --> 00:15:27,452
He's miserable.

271
00:15:30,195 --> 00:15:31,788
Be honest with me.

272
00:15:31,897 --> 00:15:33,365
Am I being selfish?

273
00:15:34,466 --> 00:15:37,231
- Making him do this so that we can stay?
- Here's what I think.

274
00:15:37,336 --> 00:15:39,896
You love someone,
you want them to be happy, right?

275
00:15:40,005 --> 00:15:40,836
Yeah.

276
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:44,274
Even if that means
maybe doing something you don't wanna?

277
00:15:44,376 --> 00:15:47,574
- Yeah.
- Okay, look.

278
00:15:48,781 --> 00:15:49,874
You think being a waitress

279
00:15:49,982 --> 00:15:52,417
in a pizza joint in Los Angeles
was what I wanted?

280
00:15:52,518 --> 00:15:54,282
- No?
- No!

281
00:15:54,386 --> 00:15:55,581
I had dreams, you know?

282
00:15:55,688 --> 00:15:58,248
I really wanted to be somebody...

283
00:15:58,357 --> 00:16:00,656
...like a dental hygienist.

284
00:16:00,759 --> 00:16:02,660
Then I fell in love
with that big galoot brother of yours.

285
00:16:02,761 --> 00:16:04,627
He wanted
to take over the family business,

286
00:16:04,730 --> 00:16:06,392
and here we are.

287
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:10,698
So, you're saying
I should go with him?

288
00:16:10,803 --> 00:16:12,829
I'm saying that if you really love him,

289
00:16:12,938 --> 00:16:15,066
you should give what he wants a try.

290
00:16:16,775 --> 00:16:18,141
He did come out here for me.

291
00:16:19,378 --> 00:16:23,338
Return the favor...
and look good doing it.

292
00:16:28,053 --> 00:16:29,248
Come on. We're going home.

293
00:16:29,355 --> 00:16:31,654
- What about the library?
- What about the floor?

294
00:16:31,757 --> 00:16:34,226
Go ahead. Get out of here.

295
00:16:34,326 --> 00:16:37,763
You know I love you guys.
I love your pizza even more.

296
00:16:39,598 --> 00:16:41,260
Honey, you're miserable.

297
00:16:42,835 --> 00:16:44,804
I see it.

298
00:16:44,903 --> 00:16:50,069
But you tried for me,
and I love you for that. I really do.

299
00:16:51,076 --> 00:16:53,136
But this isn't what
you're supposed to be doing.

300
00:16:53,245 --> 00:16:56,977
You're supposed
to be spreading the gospel...

301
00:16:57,082 --> 00:16:59,517
...not garlic and prosciutto.

302
00:17:00,586 --> 00:17:03,784
Healing souls, not tossing dough.

303
00:17:07,159 --> 00:17:10,926
I want what you want,
and if what you want is in Arizona...

304
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:12,225
Arizona?

305
00:17:12,331 --> 00:17:14,300
...then your family is going with you
to Arizona.

306
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,767
- I love you. I really love you.
- Come on.

307
00:17:19,571 --> 00:17:21,597
You think it's romantic,
some girl does what her husband wants,

308
00:17:21,707 --> 00:17:22,868
even when she don't wanna do it?

309
00:17:22,975 --> 00:17:26,969
Yeah, I think that's romantic,
you sorry Neanderthal.

310
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:29,909
Me too, I guess.

311
00:17:37,856 --> 00:17:40,223
Let me guess. You're getting a divorce.

312
00:17:40,325 --> 00:17:42,419
No, honey. Never.

313
00:17:42,528 --> 00:17:46,090
- Is somebody dying?
- No, nobody's dying.

314
00:17:46,198 --> 00:17:48,429
No, it's nothing like that.

315
00:17:48,534 --> 00:17:52,266
We are moving to Arizona temporarily.

316
00:17:52,371 --> 00:17:56,103
- What about school?
- Yeah, all our friends are here.

317
00:17:56,208 --> 00:17:59,337
Well, there are schools in Arizona.
You can make new friends.

318
00:18:00,679 --> 00:18:03,581
Your mother and I realize
that this is a lot to ask of you,

319
00:18:03,682 --> 00:18:07,551
but there's a church that needs
a helping hand down there,

320
00:18:07,653 --> 00:18:09,713
and your father has been asked to go.

321
00:18:10,656 --> 00:18:12,784
This is very important to your father.

322
00:18:12,891 --> 00:18:14,325
We need to support his decision.

323
00:18:14,426 --> 00:18:17,487
The animal shelter counts on me here.
This isn't fair.

324
00:18:17,596 --> 00:18:19,155
Chrissy. Wait. Wait. Wait.

325
00:18:39,885 --> 00:18:41,080
Chrissy.

326
00:18:42,187 --> 00:18:44,918
It's breaking my heart
to even ask you this,

327
00:18:45,023 --> 00:18:47,857
but you have to have some faith.

328
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:49,758
You have to trust your old man.

329
00:18:51,797 --> 00:18:54,357
I can't believe you're making us leave.

330
00:18:54,466 --> 00:18:56,298
I make a real difference here.

331
00:18:58,036 --> 00:18:59,937
Can't I stay
with Uncle Joey and Aunt Tina?

332
00:19:00,038 --> 00:19:02,132
Sweetheart, you are so special.

333
00:19:02,241 --> 00:19:04,540
You will make a difference
no matter where you are.

334
00:19:08,614 --> 00:19:09,980
I get my own bathroom, right?

335
00:19:10,082 --> 00:19:13,018
I mean, no more sharing
with the bathroom hog.

336
00:19:14,586 --> 00:19:16,612
- That's a deal.
- Deal.

337
00:19:18,290 --> 00:19:19,485
I drive a hard bargain, huh?

338
00:19:19,591 --> 00:19:21,924
Yes, you do. A very hard bargain.

339
00:19:22,027 --> 00:19:23,689
But I kind of feel like I got off easy.

340
00:19:23,795 --> 00:19:26,856
I thought you were going to ask
for something like your own car.

341
00:19:26,965 --> 00:19:29,958
- Was that on the table?
- Absolutely not.

342
00:19:33,972 --> 00:19:36,339
- What about a new dog?
- What do you mean?

343
00:19:39,745 --> 00:19:41,270
Deal or no deal?

344
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:42,973
Chrissy!

345
00:19:46,385 --> 00:19:47,353
Deal.

346
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:50,789
You do drive a very hard bargain.

347
00:19:50,889 --> 00:19:52,016
Thanks.

348
00:19:52,124 --> 00:19:54,116
- I love you.
- I love you too.

349
00:19:57,763 --> 00:19:59,459
Watch the light, honey.

350
00:20:11,310 --> 00:20:13,472
I never thought I'd be this sad
to leave this place.

351
00:20:14,546 --> 00:20:16,378
Come here.

352
00:20:16,481 --> 00:20:18,347
We're really gonna miss you guys.

353
00:20:22,521 --> 00:20:23,921
Us too.

354
00:20:26,291 --> 00:20:29,318
Who knows?
Maybe we'll show up in Eufala someday.

355
00:20:29,428 --> 00:20:31,863
Word is they could use
some decent pizza in Arizona.

356
00:20:31,964 --> 00:20:33,865
- Is that the word?
- Yeah.

357
00:20:44,810 --> 00:20:47,370
<i>Just because we're on the road</i>
<i>doesn't mean you can't study.</i>

358
00:20:47,479 --> 00:20:51,177
A Hundred Fun Facts about Arizona?
<i>You're kidding, right?</i>

359
00:20:51,283 --> 00:20:52,876
<i>There'll be a quiz in an hour.</i>

360
00:21:04,096 --> 00:21:07,863
<i>Wow. That's a lot smaller than I thought.</i>

361
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:10,528
<i>How is that even a town?</i>

362
00:21:10,636 --> 00:21:12,571
<i>Welcome to Eufala, kids.</i>

363
00:21:29,888 --> 00:21:32,084
Well, this is it.

364
00:21:34,226 --> 00:21:37,287
Speak now, honey,
or forever hold your peace.

365
00:21:37,396 --> 00:21:38,921
You know me.

366
00:21:39,031 --> 00:21:41,193
When I commit to something,
it's all the way, honey.

367
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:42,495
You sure?

368
00:21:43,502 --> 00:21:46,301
Being a pastor's wife means
going wherever the pastor is needed.

369
00:21:47,472 --> 00:21:48,701
I love you.

370
00:21:49,875 --> 00:21:52,606
Come on, kids. Welcome to the country.

371
00:21:54,212 --> 00:21:55,771
Come on.

372
00:21:55,881 --> 00:21:57,907
- Darling.
- Thank you.

373
00:22:00,952 --> 00:22:02,648
Someone has got a sense of humor.

374
00:22:02,754 --> 00:22:04,484
Or wants their husband
out of the house more often.

375
00:22:04,589 --> 00:22:05,750
Exactly.

376
00:22:07,125 --> 00:22:08,058
- Hey.
- Hi.

377
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:10,186
- Hi.
- I'm...

378
00:22:10,295 --> 00:22:11,888
Sir, I know who you are.

379
00:22:11,997 --> 00:22:14,694
Eufala isn't exactly the kind of place
people just wander upon.

380
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:15,699
I'm Alex Hutchins.

381
00:22:15,801 --> 00:22:18,771
I'm Randolph,
otherwise known as Pastor Randy.

382
00:22:18,870 --> 00:22:21,066
This is my beautiful wife, Mary Louise.

383
00:22:21,173 --> 00:22:22,072
- Hi.
- Hi.

384
00:22:22,174 --> 00:22:23,767
And this is my daughter, Chrissy.

385
00:22:23,875 --> 00:22:26,003
Hey, you two are
about the same age, huh?

386
00:22:26,111 --> 00:22:27,306
And this is...

387
00:22:27,412 --> 00:22:29,745
That's Yoda. That's the cute sister.

388
00:22:30,615 --> 00:22:31,708
This is my son, Peter.

389
00:22:31,817 --> 00:22:35,254
- Gosh, you're pretty.
- Hey, be a gentleman.

390
00:22:35,354 --> 00:22:37,823
- We'll see you kids inside, huh?
- All right. Bye.

391
00:22:41,693 --> 00:22:42,991
I love the whole

392
00:22:43,095 --> 00:22:45,189
I-just-fell-asleep-in-the-car look
you got going on.

393
00:22:45,297 --> 00:22:47,129
Not many girls can pull that off.

394
00:22:48,166 --> 00:22:49,862
You know, my mom, Reva,

395
00:22:49,968 --> 00:22:52,335
she owns the best beauty shop
in all of Eufala.

396
00:22:52,437 --> 00:22:54,736
You should really come by
once you get settled.

397
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:58,675
And I'm guessing you mean
the only beauty shop in Eufala.

398
00:23:00,112 --> 00:23:04,516
Why aren't you inside with the others?
Animal abusers not allowed in?

399
00:23:04,616 --> 00:23:06,812
My mom is also church secretary,

400
00:23:06,918 --> 00:23:09,285
so naturally,
she has to be here on Sundays.

401
00:23:12,457 --> 00:23:13,857
Come on. I'll show you around.

402
00:23:19,364 --> 00:23:20,627
Coming?

403
00:23:21,733 --> 00:23:23,326
And your little dog, too.

404
00:23:25,203 --> 00:23:26,831
You have to go into town for a signal.

405
00:23:27,906 --> 00:23:30,774
- God, where are we?
- Eufala.

406
00:23:32,210 --> 00:23:35,203
You know, my uncle, Danny,
he's the youth group leader at church.

407
00:23:35,313 --> 00:23:36,713
I can introduce you to him.

408
00:23:38,817 --> 00:23:40,285
- Meet you inside.
- Okay.

409
00:23:43,655 --> 00:23:46,022
Mabel, it's okay now. Just sit a spell.

410
00:23:46,124 --> 00:23:48,286
Take a deep breath.
Ain't none of us going anywhere.

411
00:23:48,393 --> 00:23:50,726
All right? Take a deep breath.

412
00:23:50,829 --> 00:23:52,127
There you go.

413
00:23:54,533 --> 00:23:55,626
Hi.

414
00:23:55,734 --> 00:23:58,226
<i>You are the one</i>

415
00:24:05,410 --> 00:24:07,936
As church secretary,
everyone's going to expect for me

416
00:24:08,046 --> 00:24:09,674
to introduce you to them personally.

417
00:24:09,781 --> 00:24:11,773
I know that they look meaner
than a bunch of rattle snakes,

418
00:24:11,883 --> 00:24:12,976
but they don't bite.

419
00:24:13,084 --> 00:24:15,576
At least not during the daytime.

420
00:24:15,687 --> 00:24:19,317
Mary Louise, I know that you and I are
going to be the best of friends.

421
00:24:19,424 --> 00:24:22,258
Nobody else in this town has
any real... style,

422
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:23,692
not like you and me.

423
00:24:25,530 --> 00:24:27,624
Now, Jimmy Watkins, I swear

424
00:24:27,732 --> 00:24:30,463
sometimes you have more moving hands
than a watch factory.

425
00:24:30,569 --> 00:24:33,061
Well, as long as you have time for me.

426
00:24:33,171 --> 00:24:34,696
Kids, I think I saw
some cookies on the table.

427
00:24:34,806 --> 00:24:37,275
- Why don't you go get something to eat?
- Go on. Go.

428
00:24:37,375 --> 00:24:38,809
Just quit horsing around.

429
00:24:38,910 --> 00:24:41,379
We are trying to make a good impression
on our new pastor.

430
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:43,039
Pleasure to meet you, Pastor.

431
00:24:43,148 --> 00:24:44,707
- Pastor Randy.
- Pastor Randy.

432
00:24:44,816 --> 00:24:47,376
- Mary Louise.
- Mary Louise. Pleasure to meet you.

433
00:24:47,486 --> 00:24:51,423
Well, I just want to apologize
for that public display of affection.

434
00:24:52,557 --> 00:24:55,584
But as you can probably tell,
this here filly,

435
00:24:55,694 --> 00:24:58,687
she's prettier than a hot glob of butter
melting on a pancake.

436
00:25:00,398 --> 00:25:03,459
Of course, I probably
don't have to tell you that, do I, Pastor?

437
00:25:03,568 --> 00:25:05,002
Would you just go away?

438
00:25:05,103 --> 00:25:07,504
There's a whole church full of people
waiting to meet these fine folks.

439
00:25:07,606 --> 00:25:09,302
All right. Well, welcome to Eufala.

440
00:25:10,375 --> 00:25:11,638
- Pleasure.
- Thank you.

441
00:25:15,347 --> 00:25:20,581
So who's responsible for that
very humorous sign that's out front?

442
00:25:20,685 --> 00:25:23,450
- Yeah. It's funny.
- That's Danny's job.

443
00:25:23,555 --> 00:25:26,320
Poor boy's only got one oar
in the water most times,

444
00:25:26,424 --> 00:25:28,222
but he is such a cutup.

445
00:25:29,427 --> 00:25:31,293
Sometimes I wish I were funny,

446
00:25:31,396 --> 00:25:32,489
I mean, instead of pretty.

447
00:25:36,067 --> 00:25:37,558
Now where was I?

448
00:25:38,837 --> 00:25:41,068
That is the Widow Smythe.

449
00:25:41,172 --> 00:25:42,970
She's kind of a celebrity here in Eufala.

450
00:25:43,074 --> 00:25:45,475
She was in some movie with Elvis
back in the day.

451
00:25:45,577 --> 00:25:48,240
<i>- Girls! Girls! Girls!</i> I think it was.
- That's impressive.

452
00:25:48,346 --> 00:25:50,713
It's hard to imagine
her ever being a movie star.

453
00:25:51,983 --> 00:25:57,422
And poor thing, she's been in love
with Pastor Zeke for going on 40 years.

454
00:25:57,522 --> 00:25:58,956
- That's a long time.
- Long time.

455
00:25:59,057 --> 00:26:00,616
- It's a very long time.
- Yeah.

456
00:26:00,725 --> 00:26:02,455
Well, she's a tough one.

457
00:26:02,561 --> 00:26:04,689
She could start an argument
in an empty house.

458
00:26:07,132 --> 00:26:09,363
I'm having a hard time...
What does that mean?

459
00:26:10,602 --> 00:26:12,628
It means she's going
to be your toughest critic.

460
00:26:13,605 --> 00:26:15,733
Well, thanks for the warning,

461
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:18,139
but Mary Louise and I,

462
00:26:18,243 --> 00:26:20,269
we're pretty good
at winning people over, so...

463
00:26:20,378 --> 00:26:23,439
In fact, why don't we go take a shot
at that right now, honey?

464
00:26:23,548 --> 00:26:24,846
- Yes. Let's go say hi.
- Thank you.

465
00:26:24,950 --> 00:26:26,350
Well, good luck.

466
00:26:31,289 --> 00:26:32,723
- Hi, baby.
- Hey.

467
00:26:32,824 --> 00:26:34,486
- Hi, baby.
- Hey, baby.

468
00:26:34,593 --> 00:26:35,526
How are ya?

469
00:26:35,627 --> 00:26:37,562
- I'm cool.
- I missed you.

470
00:26:40,231 --> 00:26:41,756
Mrs. Smythe?

471
00:26:43,835 --> 00:26:48,296
You must recognize me
from my movies, am I right?

472
00:26:48,406 --> 00:26:50,602
No, I...

473
00:26:50,709 --> 00:26:54,942
...was actually just saying
you look so familiar.

474
00:26:56,281 --> 00:26:58,216
<i>Girls! Girls! Girls!,</i> am I right?

475
00:27:00,986 --> 00:27:06,618
So, tell me why it is
you think you should be our new pastor.

476
00:27:06,725 --> 00:27:09,786
Mrs. Smythe, we just got done with this...

477
00:27:09,894 --> 00:27:11,453
Really again?

478
00:27:12,497 --> 00:27:15,194
Mrs. Smythe, it is
a pleasure to meet you.

479
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:19,533
I am just looking so forward
to meeting all of the residents of Eufala.

480
00:27:19,638 --> 00:27:22,506
Not that many worth knowing
if you ask my opinion.

481
00:27:23,908 --> 00:27:25,501
Especially not that one.

482
00:27:26,544 --> 00:27:28,604
I mean, just look how she dresses.

483
00:27:28,713 --> 00:27:31,046
And for church no less.

484
00:27:31,149 --> 00:27:34,916
It's like soup on a plate.
It's just not right.

485
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:37,854
- Right... Zeke!
- What?

486
00:27:37,956 --> 00:27:39,652
If brains were leather,

487
00:27:39,758 --> 00:27:42,751
that girl wouldn't have enough
to saddle a June bug.

488
00:27:42,861 --> 00:27:44,295
Whatever you say, Ethel.

489
00:27:44,396 --> 00:27:46,888
- Hi.
- Pastor Ezekiel?

490
00:27:48,199 --> 00:27:50,464
- You cycle?
- Sorry?

491
00:27:50,568 --> 00:27:52,537
What, are your ears flopping over?

492
00:27:52,637 --> 00:27:55,402
Do you cycle, cycle, cycle?
Do you ride a bicycle?

493
00:27:55,507 --> 00:27:59,501
Yes, yes, actually, all the time.
Yes, sir.

494
00:27:59,611 --> 00:28:03,104
Good. I do my best thinking on a bike.

495
00:28:03,214 --> 00:28:08,084
Twenty miles. Tomorrow 6:00 a.m.
Don't be late.

496
00:28:10,055 --> 00:28:12,889
I hope you are in good shape.

497
00:28:12,991 --> 00:28:15,460
Zeke is quite an athlete.

498
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:17,358
Don't judge a book by its cover.

499
00:28:21,433 --> 00:28:23,231
Where's your Bible?

500
00:28:23,334 --> 00:28:25,303
I don't trust a pastor

501
00:28:25,403 --> 00:28:27,963
who doesn't carry the good book
with him at all times.

502
00:28:28,073 --> 00:28:32,101
Well, actually, I happen to have it
downloaded right here on this tablet.

503
00:28:34,846 --> 00:28:38,783
It's very convenient to keep the good book
with me at all times.

504
00:28:38,883 --> 00:28:42,877
The Bible wasn't meant to be convenient.

505
00:28:42,987 --> 00:28:46,685
Any minister worth his salt
should carry the actual weight of the book

506
00:28:46,791 --> 00:28:52,059
to remind him of the import of the words
that he has been entrusted to share.

507
00:28:54,866 --> 00:28:57,495
Well, if that's the case,
then I guess any minister worth his salt

508
00:28:57,602 --> 00:29:02,404
would carry around stone tablets
as Moses received on the mount.

509
00:29:08,780 --> 00:29:10,510
Well played, young man.

510
00:29:12,650 --> 00:29:13,618
Well played.

511
00:29:15,653 --> 00:29:18,088
- Don't be late.
- I won't.

512
00:29:19,357 --> 00:29:21,189
I think I've had enough
of meeting people today.

513
00:29:21,292 --> 00:29:23,887
- Yeah, me too.
- Okay. Shall we...

514
00:29:23,995 --> 00:29:26,829
What do you say
we go find ourselves a place to live?

515
00:29:26,931 --> 00:29:28,490
- I think it's a great idea.
- Okay.

516
00:29:30,101 --> 00:29:33,230
Well, Mary Louise, what do you think?

517
00:29:33,338 --> 00:29:37,207
- Interesting, huh?
- Yeah, very.

518
00:29:37,308 --> 00:29:38,776
Where's our car?

519
00:29:41,212 --> 00:29:43,306
Where is our car?

520
00:29:44,649 --> 00:29:48,381
Mary Louise, the U-Haul...
Everything is gone!

521
00:29:52,157 --> 00:29:54,023
Never should've left LA.

522
00:29:54,125 --> 00:29:56,094
Officer. Officer.

523
00:29:57,362 --> 00:29:58,523
There's been a robbery.

524
00:29:58,630 --> 00:30:02,226
Are you sure? There haven't been
any robberies in Eufala...

525
00:30:02,333 --> 00:30:04,859
There was that one time
when you got called in to investigate

526
00:30:04,969 --> 00:30:06,961
when Mrs. van der Gelder's
billy goat went missing.

527
00:30:07,071 --> 00:30:08,972
Right, turns out
he just wandered next door

528
00:30:09,073 --> 00:30:10,598
to spend some time with Mabel's doe.

529
00:30:10,708 --> 00:30:13,439
And Rascal Johnson thought
that his truck was stolen

530
00:30:13,545 --> 00:30:15,605
- a while back, remember that?
- Found it a few days later

531
00:30:15,713 --> 00:30:17,978
right where he left it,
behind Billy Jean's cafe.

532
00:30:18,082 --> 00:30:21,780
I'm sorry.
We're losing precious time here.

533
00:30:21,886 --> 00:30:24,981
We're not talking about
Mrs. van der Gelder's love-struck goat

534
00:30:25,089 --> 00:30:27,888
or Rascal Johnson's long lost truck.

535
00:30:27,992 --> 00:30:29,893
We're talking about everything
we own in the world.

536
00:30:32,063 --> 00:30:33,725
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

537
00:30:33,832 --> 00:30:37,894
My family loses everything,
and the best they can do is laugh.

538
00:30:38,002 --> 00:30:42,133
Mary Louise, we're going back
to the city where it's safe.

539
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:45,108
- In what car?
- Now hold on there, Padre.

540
00:30:46,044 --> 00:30:47,410
I'll give you a ride.

541
00:30:47,512 --> 00:30:49,640
I promise we'll find your stuff.

542
00:30:54,652 --> 00:30:56,848
- Coming?
- Yeah.

543
00:30:59,157 --> 00:31:02,025
So, how do you all like Eufala?

544
00:31:02,126 --> 00:31:03,958
Well, we've only been here
a couple of hours,

545
00:31:04,062 --> 00:31:07,089
and we don't have a place to live,
and all our stuff has been stolen,

546
00:31:07,198 --> 00:31:09,565
but other than that, it's great.

547
00:31:09,667 --> 00:31:12,466
- I'm sorry. Is something funny?
- No.

548
00:31:12,570 --> 00:31:17,406
Actually, our impression of Eufala
is less than dandy at the moment.

549
00:31:18,476 --> 00:31:21,378
- Dad.
- No, no, not now, Peter.

550
00:31:21,479 --> 00:31:23,641
And frankly, I would expect
more out of you, Officer,

551
00:31:23,748 --> 00:31:26,183
even if you're not used
to bad things happening

552
00:31:26,284 --> 00:31:27,547
in your little town.

553
00:31:27,652 --> 00:31:29,177
No, Dad,
you should really look out the window.

554
00:31:29,287 --> 00:31:31,347
Chrissy, just give me a minute, all right?

555
00:31:32,257 --> 00:31:33,555
- Randy.
- What?

556
00:31:36,728 --> 00:31:39,220
It seems we've gotten off
like a herd of turtles, Padre.

557
00:31:39,330 --> 00:31:43,097
This is the house the church provides
for the pastor.

558
00:31:43,201 --> 00:31:44,931
It's yours for as long as you're here.

559
00:31:45,870 --> 00:31:47,862
And that is Eufala helping you move in.

560
00:31:47,972 --> 00:31:49,600
Why don't you guys go check it out?

561
00:31:49,707 --> 00:31:50,834
Dibs on the biggest bathroom.

562
00:31:50,942 --> 00:31:52,706
What are you waiting for?

563
00:31:52,810 --> 00:31:54,278
Let's go see our new home.

564
00:31:54,379 --> 00:31:56,109
What is going on?

565
00:31:56,214 --> 00:31:57,842
They're unloading our stuff, honey.

566
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:01,151
Welcome to the country, family.

567
00:32:02,020 --> 00:32:03,511
This is amazing.

568
00:32:05,790 --> 00:32:08,419
<i>Set this up</i>
<i>like it's your own kitchen, girls.</i>

569
00:32:08,526 --> 00:32:12,486
Everything convenient
and organized, all right?

570
00:32:12,597 --> 00:32:14,395
Tell me why we have to do this.

571
00:32:14,499 --> 00:32:16,525
I mean, they're only here for six months.

572
00:32:16,634 --> 00:32:19,798
Then we have to do this all over again
for the next pastor and his family.

573
00:32:19,904 --> 00:32:23,272
Well, that's not
how we do things in Eufala, now is it?

574
00:32:23,374 --> 00:32:25,843
We never know how long
someone is going to be in our lives,

575
00:32:25,944 --> 00:32:27,936
so we welcome them
as though it's going to be forever.

576
00:32:28,046 --> 00:32:29,810
You know how these city people are.

577
00:32:29,914 --> 00:32:33,851
I mean, I bet you anything
she doesn't even know how to cook.

578
00:32:33,952 --> 00:32:35,386
They probably go out and eat all the time

579
00:32:35,486 --> 00:32:37,751
and never eat at home
like a family should.

580
00:32:37,855 --> 00:32:39,517
Have you seen the way she dresses?

581
00:32:41,359 --> 00:32:43,191
Way too fancy for a preacher's wife.

582
00:32:43,294 --> 00:32:45,923
There's nothing wrong
with wanting to look your best.

583
00:32:46,030 --> 00:32:47,692
You know, it must be scary

584
00:32:47,799 --> 00:32:50,291
moving to a new town
and meeting new folks.

585
00:32:51,469 --> 00:32:54,064
- What is this?
- It's a juicer.

586
00:32:55,907 --> 00:32:59,935
You know, for those rare occasions
where we don't go out to eat.

587
00:33:00,044 --> 00:33:03,276
I actually like to use
organic fresh fruits and vegetables,

588
00:33:03,381 --> 00:33:07,978
you know, like kale,
wheat germ, strawberries.

589
00:33:08,086 --> 00:33:13,024
We are so happy your family is
here in Eufala, aren't we, ladies?

590
00:33:13,124 --> 00:33:16,288
What smells so delicious?

591
00:33:19,630 --> 00:33:22,031
Mary Louise, you simply haven't lived

592
00:33:22,133 --> 00:33:25,365
until you've tried Lila's
country fried steak and sweet potato pie.

593
00:33:30,208 --> 00:33:33,406
Honey, do you need to step outside
and get some air?

594
00:33:33,511 --> 00:33:34,843
I think so.

595
00:33:42,687 --> 00:33:44,155
Hey, you all right, honey?

596
00:33:44,255 --> 00:33:47,714
Yeah, yeah, I'm just not used
to eating any stuff like that.

597
00:33:47,825 --> 00:33:49,987
You know, all those carbs.

598
00:33:50,094 --> 00:33:53,861
Well, I do suppose that Southern cooking
can take some getting used to.

599
00:33:53,965 --> 00:33:55,900
Yeah.

600
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:00,938
Say, is everyone in Eufala
always this nice and helpful?

601
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:03,941
Well, I mean, I guess we have our share
of good old boys

602
00:34:04,042 --> 00:34:06,944
who break bad every now and again,
but for the most part, yeah.

603
00:34:07,045 --> 00:34:08,638
We just tend to take care of each other.

604
00:34:08,746 --> 00:34:10,612
Just being neighborly,
I guess you could say.

605
00:34:10,715 --> 00:34:13,014
Yeah, I didn't know
any of my neighbors back in the city.

606
00:34:13,117 --> 00:34:15,951
Well, I guess that it can take some time
to get to know your neighbors.

607
00:34:16,054 --> 00:34:17,454
We were there for years.

608
00:34:19,323 --> 00:34:22,623
That's Norma Nichols,
editor of the <i>Eufala Tattler.</i>

609
00:34:22,727 --> 00:34:23,888
Look at her.

610
00:34:23,995 --> 00:34:27,454
Madder than a mule chewing
on bumble bees.

611
00:34:27,565 --> 00:34:30,194
- Bumble bees?
- Norma doesn't care for me much.

612
00:34:30,301 --> 00:34:32,099
She fancies Officer Barney.

613
00:34:33,704 --> 00:34:36,902
She thinks that... It's so silly.
...I flirt with him.

614
00:34:37,008 --> 00:34:39,000
Well, you kind of do.

615
00:34:39,110 --> 00:34:45,812
Please. As if any guy who liked...
this would go for her.

616
00:34:45,917 --> 00:34:47,852
- Reva.
- Norma.

617
00:34:47,952 --> 00:34:50,854
Good afternoon, ladies.
Hi, I'm Norma Nichols,

618
00:34:50,955 --> 00:34:54,483
editor of the <i>Eufala Tattler.</i>
Now I assume you're...

619
00:34:54,592 --> 00:34:57,118
Mary Louise. It's a pleasure.

620
00:34:57,228 --> 00:35:02,223
Pastor Ezekiel retiring after 50 years
is a big change for the people of Eufala.

621
00:35:02,333 --> 00:35:04,700
I'd like to do a cover story
on your family.

622
00:35:04,802 --> 00:35:05,861
Introduce yourselves,

623
00:35:05,970 --> 00:35:07,700
help the community get
to know their new guests.

624
00:35:07,805 --> 00:35:09,273
All right, I'll go get my husband.

625
00:35:09,373 --> 00:35:11,672
Bless your heart.

626
00:35:13,077 --> 00:35:14,443
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

627
00:35:15,746 --> 00:35:18,011
Mary Louise, a word please.

628
00:35:18,116 --> 00:35:21,280
You see, that doesn't really mean
what you think it does.

629
00:35:21,385 --> 00:35:25,117
What Reva really means is
that was just a silly statement,

630
00:35:25,223 --> 00:35:27,522
but you're just not self-aware enough
to know it.

631
00:35:30,361 --> 00:35:33,661
Mary Louise, it's you I want to interview.

632
00:35:33,764 --> 00:35:38,134
Good gracious, Norma,
our guests just got here.

633
00:35:38,236 --> 00:35:41,968
Maybe your little interview
will have to wait.

634
00:35:42,073 --> 00:35:44,542
Very well then. Good day.

635
00:35:44,642 --> 00:35:46,110
Why don't you come back tomorrow?

636
00:35:46,210 --> 00:35:49,339
I'm sure that Mary Louise will be happy
to answer all your questions then.

637
00:35:50,948 --> 00:35:52,007
Little bit intense.

638
00:35:52,116 --> 00:35:56,053
Yeah. Sometimes that girl
just dills my pickle.

639
00:35:56,154 --> 00:35:58,749
But... Norma's all right, I suppose.

640
00:35:58,856 --> 00:36:02,588
I mean, she just needs
to loosen up a little bit.

641
00:36:03,828 --> 00:36:06,992
I tell you, the only reason that I flirt
with Officer Barney at all

642
00:36:07,098 --> 00:36:08,464
is to get Norma's goat.

643
00:36:08,566 --> 00:36:11,058
I got my eyes on Jimmy Watkins.

644
00:36:11,169 --> 00:36:12,159
Okay.

645
00:36:19,110 --> 00:36:21,272
Forget how good fresh air tasted.

646
00:36:25,716 --> 00:36:27,412
So...

647
00:36:27,518 --> 00:36:29,919
...you think this might be
a good move for us?

648
00:36:30,021 --> 00:36:31,250
Well, this is your calling, right?

649
00:36:32,823 --> 00:36:35,952
Not Arizona. I mean the ministry.

650
00:36:38,596 --> 00:36:40,588
When I was a kid,
I didn't want to go to church.

651
00:36:40,698 --> 00:36:41,722
My parents made me go.

652
00:36:41,832 --> 00:36:44,131
All the other kids would be
playing football in the street.

653
00:36:44,235 --> 00:36:46,534
I was jealous. I didn't think it was fair.

654
00:36:47,672 --> 00:36:50,801
My mother said, "It doesn't matter
if it's fair. It's right."

655
00:36:52,143 --> 00:36:55,875
But I was grateful to her
after I heard the story of Samuel,

656
00:36:55,980 --> 00:36:58,211
that even small children
could hear the voice of God.

657
00:36:59,150 --> 00:37:01,244
And I so wanted God to speak to me.

658
00:37:02,587 --> 00:37:05,022
But no matter how still it was at night,

659
00:37:05,122 --> 00:37:07,455
or how quiet I was in the back of the bus,

660
00:37:07,558 --> 00:37:09,049
I couldn't hear anything.

661
00:37:10,494 --> 00:37:12,588
So, I started to think
that maybe I was unworthy,

662
00:37:12,697 --> 00:37:14,928
or that God spoke
to other people and not me.

663
00:37:15,032 --> 00:37:17,627
Then my mother told me,
"You know what, Randal?

664
00:37:17,735 --> 00:37:19,135
"You're doing it wrong.

665
00:37:19,237 --> 00:37:21,797
You don't listen for God with your ears.
You listen with your heart."

666
00:37:21,906 --> 00:37:24,774
And that's when everything changed for me.

667
00:37:27,411 --> 00:37:30,210
That's when I heard his voice.

668
00:37:30,314 --> 00:37:33,614
And now, I think I can hear him saying

669
00:37:33,718 --> 00:37:37,280
that this might be
the right place for us for a while.

670
00:37:39,056 --> 00:37:41,855
Maybe it's not so bad,
us being here for a while, huh, kids?

671
00:37:41,959 --> 00:37:43,757
- What do you think?
- I can make it work.

672
00:37:43,861 --> 00:37:44,885
- Yeah?
- It's cool.

673
00:37:44,996 --> 00:37:48,763
I mean, I don't gotta share
a bathroom anymore with... her.

674
00:37:48,866 --> 00:37:52,359
Yeah, it wasn't a walk
in the park for me either.

675
00:37:52,470 --> 00:37:54,905
- What about you, Chrissy?
- Six months?

676
00:37:56,073 --> 00:37:58,702
Yeah, it'll be okay.

677
00:37:58,809 --> 00:38:00,744
What do you say, girl?

678
00:38:00,845 --> 00:38:01,778
Yoda is in, too.

679
00:38:01,879 --> 00:38:03,643
- All right then.
- All right then.

680
00:38:03,748 --> 00:38:05,808
It's settled. We're staying.

681
00:38:05,916 --> 00:38:07,316
Only for six months, though.

682
00:38:13,924 --> 00:38:15,187
- Hey.
- Hey.

683
00:38:15,293 --> 00:38:16,488
Where you going?

684
00:38:16,594 --> 00:38:19,325
I'm going bike riding
with Pastor Ezekiel, remember?

685
00:38:19,430 --> 00:38:21,763
Honey, do you think
that's such a good idea?

686
00:38:21,866 --> 00:38:25,132
Well, it's a chance for me
to get to know Pastor Ezekiel.

687
00:38:25,236 --> 00:38:27,205
Find out more about the congregation,

688
00:38:27,305 --> 00:38:29,797
what they're looking for
in the line of a new minister.

689
00:38:29,907 --> 00:38:31,933
Besides, the sooner
I find a new minister...

690
00:38:32,043 --> 00:38:33,773
The sooner we get
to go back to Los Angeles.

691
00:38:33,878 --> 00:38:35,039
- Bingo.
- Okay.

692
00:38:35,146 --> 00:38:36,808
Besides, what could go wrong?

693
00:38:36,914 --> 00:38:39,440
I don't know, but just be careful.
You haven't been on a bike in a long time.

694
00:38:39,550 --> 00:38:41,746
Please, honey,
the guy is like 90 years old.

695
00:38:41,852 --> 00:38:42,979
I think I'm going to make it.

696
00:38:43,087 --> 00:38:46,546
There is one problem.
You don't really have a bike.

697
00:38:46,657 --> 00:38:48,125
There is that.

698
00:38:48,225 --> 00:38:49,921
Gonna use Pete's 12-speed.

699
00:38:51,062 --> 00:38:52,530
Uncle Joey took that.

700
00:38:53,798 --> 00:38:56,290
- Your brother took Pete's bike?
- Yeah.

701
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:58,266
Yeah, but I mean,
you could just use Chrissy's.

702
00:39:00,004 --> 00:39:01,939
Yeah, go for it.

703
00:39:04,308 --> 00:39:05,936
The things we do for the Lord.

704
00:39:06,043 --> 00:39:08,205
I doubt seeing
an out-of-shape city minister

705
00:39:08,312 --> 00:39:10,907
ride a bike is on His wish list.

706
00:39:11,015 --> 00:39:15,043
Well, getting to know Pastor Ezekiel
I'll bet you is.

707
00:39:20,324 --> 00:39:22,850
- Pastor Zeke.
- Pastor Randy.

708
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:25,691
I thought this might be a little too early
for a Yankee city boy.

709
00:39:25,796 --> 00:39:29,528
No, no, no, in the city, we like to say,
"Early bird gets the worm."

710
00:39:29,633 --> 00:39:32,694
That's a good one. Okay, let's get rolling

711
00:39:32,803 --> 00:39:35,671
before the sun gets so hot
it'll melt the smile right off your face.

712
00:39:35,773 --> 00:39:36,797
Yes, sir.

713
00:39:37,875 --> 00:39:39,309
That's your bike?

714
00:39:41,612 --> 00:39:43,604
Well, I hope your chances
of finding a pastor

715
00:39:43,714 --> 00:39:44,943
are better than your choice in bikes,

716
00:39:45,049 --> 00:39:47,644
or I'll be leading this congregation
for the next 50 years.

717
00:39:47,752 --> 00:39:49,118
Is this a joke?

718
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:53,555
Well, sir, it's kind of been
in the family a long time.

719
00:39:53,657 --> 00:39:56,058
I'm just yanking your chain there.

720
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:59,187
I'm sure you'll find
somebody to replace me.

721
00:39:59,296 --> 00:40:00,764
Maybe you have already.

722
00:40:02,533 --> 00:40:06,470
Okay, let's get this show on the road
before it gets so hot,

723
00:40:06,570 --> 00:40:09,039
we won't be able
to make sense out of anything.

724
00:40:09,140 --> 00:40:11,905
You know what
that character Charlie Brown says?

725
00:40:12,009 --> 00:40:15,343
- What's that, sir?
- He says, "Life is like a 10-speed bike.

726
00:40:15,446 --> 00:40:18,382
Most of us have gears
we haven't even used yet."

727
00:40:19,817 --> 00:40:20,944
Zeke.

728
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:25,419
- Come on. Don't lollygag!
- Pastor Ezekiel!

729
00:41:01,192 --> 00:41:03,457
I suppose I should have
taken it easier on you,

730
00:41:03,561 --> 00:41:05,689
being your first day and all.

731
00:41:06,864 --> 00:41:07,854
I'll be all right, sir.

732
00:41:07,965 --> 00:41:11,493
I just... need a moment
to catch my breath.

733
00:41:11,602 --> 00:41:13,537
I just want to make one thing clear.

734
00:41:13,637 --> 00:41:16,505
This retirement is not my idea.

735
00:41:16,607 --> 00:41:20,408
I... still got a few good years left
in me.

736
00:41:20,511 --> 00:41:22,139
I'm slowing down a bit.

737
00:41:22,246 --> 00:41:25,478
I may lose a word,
lose my place occasionally.

738
00:41:25,583 --> 00:41:29,918
I've been known to nod off
when Jimmy's choir starts caterwauling,

739
00:41:30,020 --> 00:41:33,252
but I have the fire inside me.

740
00:41:33,357 --> 00:41:36,759
You know, once you have
the word of God in your heart...

741
00:41:36,861 --> 00:41:38,056
Well, you know what I mean.

742
00:41:38,162 --> 00:41:39,460
Yes, sir.

743
00:41:43,934 --> 00:41:45,300
I suppose they're right.

744
00:41:46,704 --> 00:41:49,173
I should be thinking more
about the church,

745
00:41:49,273 --> 00:41:51,799
and thinking about keeping it
energized and current,

746
00:41:51,909 --> 00:41:56,176
and young folks coming back every week.

747
00:41:58,449 --> 00:42:01,385
Then there's Ethel.
She's not getting any younger.

748
00:42:01,485 --> 00:42:03,181
I suppose I should...

749
00:42:04,388 --> 00:42:07,085
...do the right thing
and marry the old goat

750
00:42:07,191 --> 00:42:11,652
while both of us...
still can remember our names.

751
00:42:12,863 --> 00:42:14,695
Old goat, sir?

752
00:42:14,798 --> 00:42:17,791
I've grown quite fond
of this congregation...

753
00:42:17,902 --> 00:42:20,599
...and I will not turn it over
to the wrong person.

754
00:42:20,704 --> 00:42:24,300
So, I am trusting you
to find the right person,

755
00:42:24,408 --> 00:42:27,776
or you won't get me out of here
with a crowbar and a bag of peaches.

756
00:42:27,878 --> 00:42:32,475
Well, you can count on me, sir.
I'm not going to let you down.

757
00:42:32,583 --> 00:42:33,778
See that you don't.

758
00:42:38,355 --> 00:42:42,122
Folks in Eufala don't take kindly
to having their business known,

759
00:42:42,226 --> 00:42:46,186
but you just got to try and remember
that sometimes the folks that...

760
00:42:47,598 --> 00:42:51,501
...seem to need help the least
are the ones that need it the most.

761
00:43:31,742 --> 00:43:34,109
Hey, I can give you a ride.

762
00:43:35,079 --> 00:43:36,240
No.

763
00:43:36,347 --> 00:43:39,408
That's all right. I'm okay.

764
00:43:43,387 --> 00:43:44,377
City people.

765
00:44:19,623 --> 00:44:24,118
Gosh. I really just want
to jog in peace, okay?

766
00:44:24,228 --> 00:44:25,958
I was just headed your way,
and I thought, you know,

767
00:44:26,063 --> 00:44:27,998
if you're almost finished
with your exercise there,

768
00:44:28,098 --> 00:44:29,896
we could grab that interview.

769
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,435
Look, Norma, I'm sorry. I just...

770
00:44:32,536 --> 00:44:35,335
I know. I know.
You're used to having your own space.

771
00:44:36,073 --> 00:44:37,837
- I've been there.
- Yeah.

772
00:44:37,941 --> 00:44:40,103
There's something to be said
for life in the big city,

773
00:44:40,210 --> 00:44:43,669
being left alone, being anonymous.

774
00:44:44,815 --> 00:44:48,684
Any chance you got time for that interview
this afternoon, Mary Louise? Say 4:00?

775
00:44:54,291 --> 00:44:57,386
- Yeah, all right. Sure.
- Okay, I'll see you at 4:00.

776
00:45:00,030 --> 00:45:01,088
<i>Hello?</i>

777
00:45:02,266 --> 00:45:03,564
<i>Is anyone here?</i>

778
00:45:03,667 --> 00:45:05,659
Right here!

779
00:45:08,772 --> 00:45:10,138
Hello?

780
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:11,833
I'm in here, honey.

781
00:45:16,080 --> 00:45:17,776
Hi.

782
00:45:17,881 --> 00:45:18,974
I hope you don't mind.

783
00:45:19,083 --> 00:45:22,952
I just came in through the front door,
'cause it was unlocked.

784
00:45:23,053 --> 00:45:25,318
That lock hasn't worked in years.

785
00:45:25,422 --> 00:45:27,516
You people don't lock your doors?

786
00:45:27,624 --> 00:45:30,492
Why on Earth would we do that?

787
00:45:31,862 --> 00:45:32,522
Right.

788
00:45:32,629 --> 00:45:34,621
You look terrible.

789
00:45:34,732 --> 00:45:36,598
Well, thank you.

790
00:45:38,168 --> 00:45:40,535
Is this my desk?

791
00:45:42,573 --> 00:45:45,338
- Yes.
- Yeah?

792
00:45:45,442 --> 00:45:49,937
Okay, these are
next Sunday's church bulletins.

793
00:45:50,047 --> 00:45:53,017
Pastor Zeke likes me to get them
printed up by Tuesday

794
00:45:53,117 --> 00:45:55,109
on account that if I didn't,

795
00:45:55,219 --> 00:45:57,051
people will keep adding stuff
till the last minute.

796
00:45:57,154 --> 00:45:59,555
So, I thought you might like
to take a look.

797
00:45:59,656 --> 00:46:02,683
Great. Let's see here.

798
00:46:02,793 --> 00:46:06,924
"6:00 p.m. Bean Supper, Fellowship Hall.

799
00:46:07,030 --> 00:46:08,692
Music to follow."

800
00:46:10,434 --> 00:46:12,027
That's good. That's cute.

801
00:46:12,136 --> 00:46:13,536
I don't get it.

802
00:46:13,637 --> 00:46:15,731
"Bean supper. Music to follow."

803
00:46:17,508 --> 00:46:18,908
Yeah, beans and music.

804
00:46:19,009 --> 00:46:21,740
Yeah, I guess I am funny
and not just pretty.

805
00:46:21,845 --> 00:46:23,609
I'm sorry that the place is such a mess.

806
00:46:24,982 --> 00:46:27,247
I tend to get a little bit behind
in my filing

807
00:46:27,351 --> 00:46:30,048
on account of I'm only here
a couple hours.

808
00:46:30,154 --> 00:46:32,419
I have to leave at noon to go do hair.

809
00:46:34,625 --> 00:46:38,187
Reva's Curl Up & Dye Beauty Salon.

810
00:46:38,295 --> 00:46:40,924
"Curl Up & Dye"?

811
00:46:41,031 --> 00:46:42,624
Are you serious?

812
00:46:42,733 --> 00:46:44,497
Our motto is,

813
00:46:44,601 --> 00:46:47,935
"If you're not becoming to him,
you better be coming to us."

814
00:46:48,038 --> 00:46:50,064
You should give that to your wife.

815
00:46:50,174 --> 00:46:53,144
I mean, not that
your wife's not becoming to you.

816
00:46:55,145 --> 00:46:56,807
Oh, my gosh. Of course she isn't.

817
00:46:56,914 --> 00:47:00,373
You're a pastor.
It's not like you guys are...

818
00:47:00,484 --> 00:47:05,047
No, no, I appreciate my wife's appearance
just as much as any other man.

819
00:47:05,155 --> 00:47:06,555
That's not what I meant to say.

820
00:47:06,657 --> 00:47:11,391
I didn't mean that I appreciate other men
appreciating my wife's appearance.

821
00:47:11,495 --> 00:47:12,360
That's not what I...

822
00:47:12,462 --> 00:47:13,725
You're bad.

823
00:47:17,167 --> 00:47:18,658
Am I interrupting something?

824
00:47:18,769 --> 00:47:21,136
Thank goodness. Please do come in.

825
00:47:21,238 --> 00:47:23,434
I got to get to Reva's Curl Up & Dye.

826
00:47:24,408 --> 00:47:26,138
It's not going to open itself, now is it?

827
00:47:33,016 --> 00:47:34,245
Please, sit down.

828
00:47:37,387 --> 00:47:38,582
Hi.

829
00:47:41,425 --> 00:47:42,688
How can I help you?

830
00:47:42,793 --> 00:47:44,625
Well...

831
00:47:44,728 --> 00:47:48,529
...Pastor Ezekiel hasn't paid attention
to things for a little while.

832
00:47:48,632 --> 00:47:50,931
- And?
- And well, look around.

833
00:47:51,034 --> 00:47:55,438
I mean, we're busting at the seams.
Everything is all worn out, out of date.

834
00:47:55,539 --> 00:48:00,136
I see. So you have some suggestions
that you'd like to make.

835
00:48:00,944 --> 00:48:03,573
All right... new choir robes.

836
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:06,479
- Choir robe.
- State-of-the-art sound system.

837
00:48:07,918 --> 00:48:10,080
- State-of-the-art sound system.
- Yeah.

838
00:48:10,187 --> 00:48:12,281
And a real rehearsal space.

839
00:48:13,156 --> 00:48:14,852
And an actual pastor's office.

840
00:48:16,226 --> 00:48:17,785
New pastor's office. Thank you.

841
00:48:17,895 --> 00:48:20,421
What we need is a new building.

842
00:48:21,498 --> 00:48:23,524
New building? Listen...

843
00:48:24,768 --> 00:48:27,863
...I am the temporary pastor here,

844
00:48:27,971 --> 00:48:32,773
but mainly, I'm here
to find a replacement for Pastor Ezekiel,

845
00:48:32,876 --> 00:48:34,401
so you might want to take this up with...

846
00:48:34,511 --> 00:48:38,915
Pastor Randy, think of this
as an opportunity

847
00:48:39,016 --> 00:48:41,747
to make a real difference here in Eufala.

848
00:48:43,921 --> 00:48:46,356
Mary Louise, I just want to say
thank you so much

849
00:48:46,456 --> 00:48:49,915
for having me in your beautiful home
for the interview.

850
00:48:50,027 --> 00:48:51,791
I've been real excited.

851
00:48:53,730 --> 00:48:58,668
Now, I do understand you've already met
Eufala's most influential people.

852
00:48:58,769 --> 00:49:01,637
Widow Smythe for example.

853
00:49:01,738 --> 00:49:07,302
Yes, Mrs. Smythe does seem to have
quite a hold on this town, doesn't she?

854
00:49:07,411 --> 00:49:10,813
I know. I don't get it myself.

855
00:49:10,914 --> 00:49:13,110
It's always been that way.

856
00:49:13,216 --> 00:49:15,651
And you know what?
I guess it always will be.

857
00:49:15,752 --> 00:49:17,721
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

858
00:49:19,489 --> 00:49:23,688
So tell me, what do people in Eufala do?

859
00:49:23,794 --> 00:49:26,286
I mean, for fun?

860
00:49:26,396 --> 00:49:30,163
Well, a lot of the women,
they like their scrapping.

861
00:49:31,168 --> 00:49:34,104
Scrapbooking, putting photos in books.

862
00:49:34,204 --> 00:49:37,436
Quilting, swap meets.

863
00:49:38,208 --> 00:49:39,972
On the weekends, you got your rodeos,

864
00:49:40,077 --> 00:49:43,878
and your square dancing, and pie baking.

865
00:49:45,015 --> 00:49:48,281
Bingo. Bingo is real fun.

866
00:49:49,186 --> 00:49:51,052
I almost won once.

867
00:49:52,422 --> 00:49:54,721
Gosh, I really miss the big city.

868
00:49:54,825 --> 00:49:58,023
- Not like the city.
- Not like the city.

869
00:49:58,128 --> 00:50:00,893
Shopping, restaurants,

870
00:50:00,998 --> 00:50:02,990
museums, art galleries,

871
00:50:03,100 --> 00:50:05,729
opera, Broadway.

872
00:50:05,836 --> 00:50:08,704
Seems I never had time
to do any of those things.

873
00:50:08,805 --> 00:50:11,536
That's one thing
you'll have plenty of in Eufala.

874
00:50:11,641 --> 00:50:13,507
- Time?
- Time.

875
00:50:15,479 --> 00:50:17,414
Mary Louise, don't get me wrong.

876
00:50:17,514 --> 00:50:20,177
There's a lot to be said
for living in a place like Eufala.

877
00:50:20,283 --> 00:50:23,219
Clean air, clean water,

878
00:50:23,320 --> 00:50:26,654
no traffic, no lines.

879
00:50:26,757 --> 00:50:28,658
No lines ever.

880
00:50:32,029 --> 00:50:34,692
People here, they're different.

881
00:50:35,599 --> 00:50:37,966
Everyone knows everyone else.

882
00:50:38,068 --> 00:50:41,163
They always smile and say hello to you

883
00:50:41,271 --> 00:50:44,332
when you pass them by on the street
for no reason.

884
00:50:45,642 --> 00:50:47,873
And they're always willing to help.

885
00:50:47,978 --> 00:50:49,378
No matter what.

886
00:50:50,547 --> 00:50:52,539
That actually sounds kind of great.

887
00:51:09,199 --> 00:51:10,360
Widow Smythe!

888
00:51:11,668 --> 00:51:15,469
I mean, Mrs. Smythe.
I'm so sorry. Please...

889
00:51:15,572 --> 00:51:17,803
Save the pleasantries, young man.

890
00:51:17,908 --> 00:51:19,399
I'm sure you know

891
00:51:19,509 --> 00:51:22,343
that I am the most generous supporter
of this church.

892
00:51:22,446 --> 00:51:24,540
Without me...

893
00:51:24,648 --> 00:51:30,986
Well... let's just say
I expect to be consulted

894
00:51:31,088 --> 00:51:36,686
before you make the decision
on the replacement pastor.

895
00:51:36,793 --> 00:51:39,991
- I've made myself clear?
- Abundantly.

896
00:51:48,672 --> 00:51:49,901
Sorry I'm late.

897
00:51:51,475 --> 00:51:54,206
- Right.
- Reva didn't tell you.

898
00:51:55,112 --> 00:51:56,512
I swear my sister would
forget her own name

899
00:51:56,613 --> 00:51:58,445
if it wasn't written
right there on her license.

900
00:52:01,551 --> 00:52:03,213
- You were saying?
- Right.

901
00:52:03,320 --> 00:52:05,255
Well, in addition to being
the youth group director,

902
00:52:05,355 --> 00:52:09,588
I also fill in as church secretary
on the afternoons when Reva leaves to...

903
00:52:09,693 --> 00:52:11,889
- Does hair.
- Right.

904
00:52:11,995 --> 00:52:15,329
There is so much work to do around here.

905
00:52:15,432 --> 00:52:17,492
It's no wonder Reva can't make
heads or tails of anything.

906
00:52:17,601 --> 00:52:19,627
I do what I can, but...

907
00:52:20,837 --> 00:52:22,567
...to be quite honest...

908
00:52:22,672 --> 00:52:24,971
...planning the youth group musical
doesn't really leave me

909
00:52:25,075 --> 00:52:27,101
a lot of time to do much else, so...

910
00:52:27,210 --> 00:52:28,974
...been pretty busy.

911
00:52:30,313 --> 00:52:31,246
Planning a musical?

912
00:52:31,348 --> 00:52:32,475
I call it <i>God Star.</i>

913
00:52:32,582 --> 00:52:35,518
It's kind of a mixture between <i>Godspell</i>
and <i>Jesus Christ Superstar.</i>

914
00:52:35,619 --> 00:52:38,020
I think of it as like
a feel-good rock opera

915
00:52:38,121 --> 00:52:41,182
based on <i>The Gospel of Matthew</i>
and ending with the Last Supper.

916
00:52:43,493 --> 00:52:47,157
And... it all takes place... Wait for it.

917
00:52:47,264 --> 00:52:48,493
...on the Ark.

918
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:51,995
You're building an ark?

919
00:52:52,903 --> 00:52:54,531
Lord willing and the creek don't rise.

920
00:52:56,072 --> 00:52:57,438
Lord willing... creek don't rise.

921
00:52:57,541 --> 00:52:59,271
I'm gonna need a translator.

922
00:52:59,376 --> 00:53:04,610
So, do we have the funds
for this little production?

923
00:53:08,552 --> 00:53:10,612
You know, funds schmunds, right?

924
00:53:10,720 --> 00:53:12,348
All anyone ever cares about is money.

925
00:53:12,455 --> 00:53:15,050
Come on, people. This is art.
It's theater!

926
00:53:16,126 --> 00:53:17,253
Great.

927
00:53:20,330 --> 00:53:21,662
This looks great.

928
00:53:21,765 --> 00:53:25,293
Everybody brought so much food yesterday,
it's like...

929
00:53:25,402 --> 00:53:28,668
I got like eight pies, cake,

930
00:53:28,772 --> 00:53:30,934
and two casseroles I don't even recognize.

931
00:53:32,209 --> 00:53:33,871
Mary Louise?

932
00:53:33,977 --> 00:53:36,242
You think you could learn
to love living in Eufala?

933
00:53:38,048 --> 00:53:41,246
- You taping this?
- Totally off the record.

934
00:53:41,351 --> 00:53:44,480
To be honest with you,
I'm not completely sure.

935
00:53:45,455 --> 00:53:48,015
But I told my husband
I would give it a good try, so...

936
00:53:48,124 --> 00:53:50,093
That's all we can ask for.

937
00:53:51,962 --> 00:53:54,454
Hey, I've told you all sorts
of personal stuff about me.

938
00:53:54,564 --> 00:53:55,930
It's your turn.

939
00:53:56,032 --> 00:53:58,934
Guys, it was nice of your mom
to invite me over for lunch.

940
00:53:59,035 --> 00:54:01,504
Yeah, I guess.
I mean, we had all these people

941
00:54:01,605 --> 00:54:04,370
that brought over food,
so it's a shame to see it go to waste.

942
00:54:04,474 --> 00:54:06,841
Well, it was still nice of her.

943
00:54:10,847 --> 00:54:12,179
Are you not gonna eat that?

944
00:54:14,217 --> 00:54:17,051
She's a vegan, so...

945
00:54:17,153 --> 00:54:20,055
That's cool. I'm a Scorpio, so...

946
00:54:22,692 --> 00:54:25,093
She doesn't eat meat.

947
00:54:26,763 --> 00:54:29,858
Studies show that vegans live
up to nine years longer than meat eaters.

948
00:54:29,966 --> 00:54:32,162
Okay, yeah,
but I don't want to die tomorrow

949
00:54:32,269 --> 00:54:34,534
knowing that I could've had
a piece of steak today.

950
00:54:38,608 --> 00:54:41,976
You know, Peter,
you should try out for the baseball team.

951
00:54:42,078 --> 00:54:43,808
You look like a natural athlete.

952
00:54:43,913 --> 00:54:45,779
Only if video tennis counts.

953
00:54:47,183 --> 00:54:49,652
Actually, Peter, you should try out.

954
00:54:49,753 --> 00:54:51,654
I mean, you know what Mom always says.

955
00:54:51,755 --> 00:54:54,657
Nothing amazing ever comes
from staying in your comfort zone.

956
00:54:55,392 --> 00:54:57,452
Besides it's a way to make friends,
so win-win.

957
00:55:00,463 --> 00:55:03,956
You guys are so lucky.
I always wanted a brother.

958
00:55:04,067 --> 00:55:05,535
Yeah. Lucky.

959
00:55:06,403 --> 00:55:10,067
Well, like I said, my Uncle Danny,
he's the youth group leader at church.

960
00:55:10,173 --> 00:55:11,903
This is interesting because...

961
00:55:12,008 --> 00:55:13,237
Danny is in charge of fund-raising,

962
00:55:13,343 --> 00:55:17,178
like, you know, car washes,
and bake sales, and musicals.

963
00:55:18,415 --> 00:55:20,111
Lots and lots of musicals.

964
00:55:20,216 --> 00:55:21,775
We actually just started rehearsals.

965
00:55:21,885 --> 00:55:24,582
You're in a musical?

966
00:55:24,688 --> 00:55:26,554
I mean, no offense,

967
00:55:26,656 --> 00:55:28,818
but you don't exactly look
like the performing type.

968
00:55:28,925 --> 00:55:31,019
Unless you're performing
a dissection or something.

969
00:55:31,127 --> 00:55:33,187
You're right.
It's not anything I want to do,

970
00:55:33,296 --> 00:55:36,960
but since my uncle is
the youth group leader at church,

971
00:55:37,067 --> 00:55:38,729
I don't really have a choice.

972
00:55:40,370 --> 00:55:41,429
Now, neither do you.

973
00:55:41,538 --> 00:55:43,769
No, I'm not really a singer or anything.

974
00:55:43,873 --> 00:55:46,809
Come on, Danny says
it's like a rock opera.

975
00:55:46,910 --> 00:55:49,971
How bad could it be?
Maybe it'll even be fun.

976
00:55:50,080 --> 00:55:51,207
I doubt it.

977
00:55:51,314 --> 00:55:53,476
Nothing amazing ever comes
from staying in your comfort zone.

978
00:55:55,518 --> 00:56:00,422
Well, Alex says that
I'm a natural athlete, so...

979
00:56:00,523 --> 00:56:02,458
...no present like the time.

980
00:56:03,860 --> 00:56:05,021
That's not how the saying goes.

981
00:56:06,229 --> 00:56:08,562
I will never figure boys out.

982
00:56:08,665 --> 00:56:12,124
Me either,
but... it's kind of fun trying to.

983
00:56:13,837 --> 00:56:15,930
Gosh, I can't believe I ate all that.

984
00:56:17,207 --> 00:56:20,405
You know what they say.
Fresh air does that.

985
00:56:22,846 --> 00:56:24,474
Well, wait a second.
Wait a second. Not so fast.

986
00:56:24,581 --> 00:56:26,982
You promised me you were going
to tell me something about you.

987
00:56:27,083 --> 00:56:28,813
No, I don't believe I did.

988
00:56:28,918 --> 00:56:30,477
How do you know so much about the city?

989
00:56:34,858 --> 00:56:38,886
Like with all teenage girls
growing up in a small town like Eufala,

990
00:56:38,995 --> 00:56:42,124
I always dreamed
of moving to the big city.

991
00:56:42,232 --> 00:56:44,963
So, right after college, I packed my bags,

992
00:56:45,068 --> 00:56:46,559
and I moved to the big city

993
00:56:46,669 --> 00:56:49,605
to chase my dreams
of being a big broadcast journalist.

994
00:56:49,706 --> 00:56:51,197
It was a disaster.

995
00:56:52,375 --> 00:56:54,776
It took me all of a month
to realize I was not cut out

996
00:56:54,878 --> 00:56:58,178
for the cutthroat world
of the news entertainment industry.

997
00:56:59,149 --> 00:57:03,052
So, I hopped the first flight
back to Eufala and...

998
00:57:04,120 --> 00:57:05,918
...started all over again.

999
00:57:07,490 --> 00:57:09,584
It was about that time,

1000
00:57:09,692 --> 00:57:11,888
the editor of <i>The Tattler</i>
was setting to retire.

1001
00:57:13,363 --> 00:57:15,594
Mary Louise, I saw it as a sign.

1002
00:57:15,698 --> 00:57:17,929
I sold everything I could lay my hands on,

1003
00:57:18,034 --> 00:57:19,798
and I bought that paper.

1004
00:57:20,570 --> 00:57:22,596
Yeah, here we are.

1005
00:57:24,174 --> 00:57:27,702
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have pushed
this interview on you

1006
00:57:27,811 --> 00:57:29,871
- so soon right after you moved here.
- Gosh. No, no, no, no!

1007
00:57:29,979 --> 00:57:32,312
Don't be silly. I totally understood.

1008
00:57:32,415 --> 00:57:35,544
You were just doing your job, right?

1009
00:57:35,652 --> 00:57:37,314
You got to understand.

1010
00:57:37,420 --> 00:57:40,822
People around here,
they're not used to change.

1011
00:57:41,891 --> 00:57:44,554
Case in point. Pack N Shop closed,

1012
00:57:44,661 --> 00:57:46,823
and Piggly Wiggly moved right in.

1013
00:57:46,930 --> 00:57:48,558
Lord, it was terrible.

1014
00:57:48,665 --> 00:57:51,760
The people were screaming and crying
in the parking lot.

1015
00:57:51,868 --> 00:57:53,962
I mean, it was just terrible.

1016
00:57:54,070 --> 00:57:55,971
Not Eufala's most proudest moment.

1017
00:57:56,072 --> 00:57:59,565
It's natural for people
to want to resist change.

1018
00:57:59,676 --> 00:58:01,304
You should have seen
the fight I put up with Randy

1019
00:58:01,411 --> 00:58:02,879
when he told me
we were moving to Arizona.

1020
00:58:02,979 --> 00:58:06,279
- No offense.
- No offense taken, really.

1021
00:58:08,351 --> 00:58:11,651
- What's up with you and Reva?
- It's nothing, really.

1022
00:58:11,754 --> 00:58:15,020
I can recognize a couple of alley cats
fighting a block away.

1023
00:58:16,326 --> 00:58:17,624
It's silly.

1024
00:58:17,727 --> 00:58:19,025
Spill it.

1025
00:58:20,930 --> 00:58:23,957
Reva has a thing for Jimmy,
the choir director.

1026
00:58:24,067 --> 00:58:26,400
Why does she insist on flirting
with Officer Barney?

1027
00:58:26,503 --> 00:58:27,971
And you like Officer Barney.

1028
00:58:29,739 --> 00:58:32,732
Yeah. Yeah, I can see that.

1029
00:58:32,842 --> 00:58:34,003
He's handsome.

1030
00:58:35,211 --> 00:58:37,544
That uniform right?

1031
00:58:37,647 --> 00:58:38,945
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1032
00:58:39,048 --> 00:58:41,017
Reva has Jimmy.

1033
00:58:41,117 --> 00:58:43,109
Why does she have to flirt
with my Officer Barney?

1034
00:58:43,219 --> 00:58:45,552
I cannot compete with that, Mary Louise.

1035
00:58:45,655 --> 00:58:47,521
Hey, hey, hey, relax.

1036
00:58:47,624 --> 00:58:49,252
Reva doesn't have anything
that you don't have.

1037
00:58:49,359 --> 00:58:51,089
- Are you serious?
- Yeah.

1038
00:58:51,194 --> 00:58:54,221
Have you seen her? She's so beautiful.

1039
00:58:54,330 --> 00:58:56,299
I could never be like that.

1040
00:58:58,034 --> 00:59:01,527
Stand up. Stand up a minute.
Let me look at you.

1041
00:59:01,638 --> 00:59:02,697
Come on.

1042
00:59:06,309 --> 00:59:07,834
Not so close.

1043
00:59:11,548 --> 00:59:12,607
Well?

1044
00:59:13,683 --> 00:59:16,152
I've had more challenging cases.

1045
00:59:16,252 --> 00:59:17,845
See? I told you.

1046
00:59:17,954 --> 00:59:22,392
No, no, sweetie, you don't give yourself
any credit. You know that?

1047
00:59:23,860 --> 00:59:24,919
You're beautiful.

1048
00:59:26,095 --> 00:59:28,758
For some reason,
you just don't want anyone to know it.

1049
00:59:28,865 --> 00:59:31,994
What color is this, aircraft carrier?

1050
00:59:32,101 --> 00:59:35,833
- No, it's gray.
- You need a makeover, stat.

1051
00:59:36,873 --> 00:59:38,808
And you're in luck,
because I happen to be an expert

1052
00:59:38,908 --> 00:59:42,401
at... well, challenging cases.

1053
00:59:45,481 --> 00:59:46,949
I'm sorry. I can't.

1054
00:59:47,050 --> 00:59:48,450
What? Why not?

1055
00:59:48,551 --> 00:59:52,318
I'm sorry. I can't afford
the fancy things you have.

1056
00:59:52,422 --> 00:59:54,948
I'm sorry, Mary Louise.
I should get going.

1057
00:59:56,025 --> 00:59:58,187
Hold up. Hold up. Hold up. Please.

1058
00:59:58,294 --> 01:00:00,160
Sit down. Let me tell you a story.

1059
01:00:00,263 --> 01:00:02,994
Come on. Sit down.

1060
01:00:07,770 --> 01:00:09,671
When I was a little girl growing up...

1061
01:00:11,240 --> 01:00:12,731
...we didn't have much money.

1062
01:00:13,476 --> 01:00:17,208
And honestly,
it really didn't bother me much.

1063
01:00:19,682 --> 01:00:22,015
Just one day in high school, and...

1064
01:00:23,853 --> 01:00:27,312
...I was in the locker room
with these rich girls, and...

1065
01:00:28,524 --> 01:00:31,961
...I just couldn't help but notice
their flawless skin,

1066
01:00:32,061 --> 01:00:34,895
and their straight teeth...

1067
01:00:35,865 --> 01:00:37,356
...matching underwear.

1068
01:00:37,467 --> 01:00:40,699
It was that day I decided
I was going to be rich one day.

1069
01:00:42,739 --> 01:00:44,332
Then I fell in love with Randy...

1070
01:00:45,274 --> 01:00:47,436
...and, well, let's just say

1071
01:00:47,543 --> 01:00:49,978
I'm rich in a way I never ever imagined.

1072
01:00:51,748 --> 01:00:53,341
And if I wanted nice things,

1073
01:00:53,449 --> 01:00:55,680
I just had to learn how
to be a smart shopper.

1074
01:00:55,785 --> 01:00:59,051
Mary Louise, do you think
you could teach me?

1075
01:01:00,089 --> 01:01:01,421
Where's the best beauty shop in town?

1076
01:01:20,910 --> 01:01:21,969
Hi.

1077
01:01:23,346 --> 01:01:25,144
I was hoping you'd come by.

1078
01:01:25,248 --> 01:01:28,412
I've been dying to get my hands
on this glorious hair of yours.

1079
01:01:28,518 --> 01:01:31,920
Well, actually, I was hoping
you could help my friend Norma.

1080
01:01:36,125 --> 01:01:39,618
Norma. Come on, let's see
what kind of magic Reva can work on you.

1081
01:01:39,729 --> 01:01:40,890
Come on, honey.

1082
01:01:40,997 --> 01:01:42,590
I've been meaning
to do something about this.

1083
01:01:42,699 --> 01:01:45,567
- Reva, I don't think so.
- Come on.

1084
01:01:45,668 --> 01:01:48,502
- Reva.
- Don't you look lovely?

1085
01:01:48,604 --> 01:01:51,631
- Are you serious?
- There you go. Marvelous.

1086
01:01:57,980 --> 01:01:59,073
Sit.

1087
01:02:11,360 --> 01:02:13,727
See? Better already.

1088
01:02:17,967 --> 01:02:20,095
- What?
- That's my mom.

1089
01:02:22,672 --> 01:02:24,573
I wonder what's going on in there.

1090
01:02:25,908 --> 01:02:26,876
Yeah.

1091
01:02:48,965 --> 01:02:51,059
You care about what
your parents think, right?

1092
01:02:51,167 --> 01:02:53,534
You know, you do what
they want you to do?

1093
01:02:53,636 --> 01:02:54,660
Yeah, I guess.

1094
01:02:54,771 --> 01:02:57,764
Reva wants me to go
into cosmetology school...

1095
01:02:57,874 --> 01:03:00,070
...as soon as I graduate...

1096
01:03:00,176 --> 01:03:03,169
...and work here in this salon with her.

1097
01:03:03,279 --> 01:03:06,113
- That sounds pretty good to me.
- Are you kidding?

1098
01:03:07,216 --> 01:03:11,278
Chrissy, as soon as I graduate, I'm gone.

1099
01:03:13,089 --> 01:03:16,321
You know... it's not so bad here.

1100
01:03:16,425 --> 01:03:18,121
That's easy for you to say,

1101
01:03:18,227 --> 01:03:22,562
because... you didn't have
to live here your whole life.

1102
01:03:24,967 --> 01:03:26,765
What's it like, living in the city?

1103
01:03:30,306 --> 01:03:31,899
Dirty...

1104
01:03:32,008 --> 01:03:35,240
...noisy, smelly.

1105
01:03:35,344 --> 01:03:37,006
Sounds kind of wonderful.

1106
01:03:38,080 --> 01:03:39,412
Yeah, and kind of wonderful.

1107
01:03:39,515 --> 01:03:41,848
You know it's why
I dress like this, right?

1108
01:03:41,951 --> 01:03:43,180
Dirty, noisy, and smelly?

1109
01:03:44,020 --> 01:03:46,751
No, grungy and rock.

1110
01:03:46,856 --> 01:03:49,951
I keep hoping
that Reva will finally get the hint

1111
01:03:50,059 --> 01:03:52,619
that I don't want to work here
at the salon with her.

1112
01:03:52,728 --> 01:03:54,993
I want to go places and see things.

1113
01:03:55,097 --> 01:03:57,862
- Why don't you just tell her?
- She has her heart set on it.

1114
01:03:59,068 --> 01:04:02,630
And it's so frustrating, because...

1115
01:04:02,738 --> 01:04:05,401
...she already has
my whole future planned out for me.

1116
01:04:10,646 --> 01:04:12,808
Sorry I can't stop to chew the fat.

1117
01:04:12,915 --> 01:04:15,578
- What are these?
- Resumes for the replacement pastors.

1118
01:04:22,892 --> 01:04:23,757
Wonderful.

1119
01:04:23,860 --> 01:04:25,852
Mary Louise and Reva, thank you so much.

1120
01:04:28,130 --> 01:04:29,689
She looks amazing.

1121
01:04:31,734 --> 01:04:35,364
You know, I never would have thought
of that look for her, but you were right.

1122
01:04:35,471 --> 01:04:36,564
Maybe we should team up.

1123
01:04:36,672 --> 01:04:40,336
Reva's Curl Up & Dye
Beauty Salon and Consultant.

1124
01:04:41,878 --> 01:04:43,039
Hey, I'm next.

1125
01:04:44,113 --> 01:04:46,378
No, no, no, I'm next.

1126
01:04:49,185 --> 01:04:50,676
- Me.
- No.

1127
01:04:52,154 --> 01:04:53,884
Okay, people!

1128
01:04:57,093 --> 01:04:59,255
Okay, listen up, people! Come on!

1129
01:05:03,499 --> 01:05:04,899
I said, "People!"

1130
01:05:08,037 --> 01:05:10,131
That's better.

1131
01:05:10,239 --> 01:05:12,299
Now we've got six months to raise funds,

1132
01:05:12,408 --> 01:05:15,242
write, rehearse, and stage this musical,

1133
01:05:15,344 --> 01:05:17,677
so anyone who is not 100% committed,

1134
01:05:17,780 --> 01:05:22,218
well, I invite you to make our lives
a little bit easier and just leave now.

1135
01:05:31,460 --> 01:05:33,088
Good.

1136
01:05:33,195 --> 01:05:36,165
Now. We've got a lot of work to do
and not a lot of time to do it,

1137
01:05:36,265 --> 01:05:37,563
so let's get started.

1138
01:05:37,667 --> 01:05:40,603
You know what they say.
There's no present like the time.

1139
01:05:40,703 --> 01:05:42,729
That's not how the saying goes.

1140
01:05:45,541 --> 01:05:47,703
You're just adorable, aren't you?

1141
01:05:47,810 --> 01:05:50,507
I have our lovely piano player...

1142
01:05:50,613 --> 01:05:52,980
...Mabel, here to play for us.

1143
01:05:53,082 --> 01:05:54,710
Ain't that right, Mabel?

1144
01:05:54,817 --> 01:05:57,048
Old arthritis is really setting in,
ain't it?

1145
01:05:58,587 --> 01:06:01,853
Now, I know this is our first run-through,
so I don't expect it to be perfect.

1146
01:06:01,958 --> 01:06:03,426
- He does.
- I do.

1147
01:06:03,526 --> 01:06:04,687
I do. That I do.

1148
01:06:04,794 --> 01:06:07,059
But don't you worry about it, all right?

1149
01:06:07,163 --> 01:06:08,187
So let's get going.

1150
01:06:08,297 --> 01:06:11,529
- Let's just not embarrass ourselves.
- Embarrass.

1151
01:06:11,634 --> 01:06:14,035
Mabel! Turn it up, girl!

1152
01:06:16,238 --> 01:06:20,437
<i>We invite you to a very special dinner</i>

1153
01:06:20,543 --> 01:06:23,035
<i>Where the son of God is</i>
<i>our most important guest</i>

1154
01:06:23,145 --> 01:06:24,943
<i>- There'll be wine</i>
<i>- And bread</i>

1155
01:06:25,047 --> 01:06:26,015
And cheese.

1156
01:06:26,115 --> 01:06:30,177
<i>Of every flavor, so be happy</i>

1157
01:06:30,286 --> 01:06:32,152
<i>For we never know what's next</i>

1158
01:06:33,222 --> 01:06:34,713
It's happening!

1159
01:06:41,163 --> 01:06:44,497
Seriously, do you guys have to do this
in here?

1160
01:06:44,600 --> 01:06:47,832
Well, we do until you figure out some way
to get us our own choir room.

1161
01:06:47,937 --> 01:06:50,668
I told you that that is not my job.

1162
01:06:50,773 --> 01:06:52,435
My job is to find you a new pastor.

1163
01:06:52,541 --> 01:06:56,137
Well, of course, if you don't want
to have music on Sunday services...

1164
01:06:56,245 --> 01:06:57,440
No, no, we don't want that.

1165
01:06:57,546 --> 01:07:00,573
Please, just a little lower, okay?

1166
01:07:00,683 --> 01:07:02,743
- A little lower volume?
- You got it, Pastor Randy.

1167
01:07:02,852 --> 01:07:03,945
Okay.

1168
01:07:06,589 --> 01:07:07,784
Time to finish the ark.

1169
01:07:07,890 --> 01:07:09,290
Of course it is.

1170
01:07:19,935 --> 01:07:23,201
Hey, Pete. What are you doing here?

1171
01:07:24,607 --> 01:07:27,372
It's a permission slip.
I'm on the baseball team.

1172
01:07:28,711 --> 01:07:29,644
Are you kidding me?

1173
01:07:30,846 --> 01:07:34,180
Wait, wait, wait, you're talking
about... the actual baseball team.

1174
01:07:34,283 --> 01:07:36,081
You're not talking about a video game?

1175
01:07:37,053 --> 01:07:38,453
Pete, that's amazing!

1176
01:07:38,554 --> 01:07:40,682
I'm just the assistant manager.

1177
01:07:41,624 --> 01:07:43,752
"Just the assistant manager."

1178
01:07:44,794 --> 01:07:46,695
- Dude.
- Dad, don't "dude" me.

1179
01:07:46,796 --> 01:07:49,231
Sorry. I'm getting
a little excited right now,

1180
01:07:49,331 --> 01:07:53,268
but honestly, dude,
son, do you realize that the manager

1181
01:07:53,369 --> 01:07:55,497
is the most important person on the team?

1182
01:07:55,604 --> 01:07:58,540
- It's okay, I guess.
- No, it's not just okay.

1183
01:07:58,641 --> 01:08:01,372
Without a good manager,
the whole team falls apart.

1184
01:08:01,477 --> 01:08:04,174
It's just like a... Like a pastor.

1185
01:08:04,280 --> 01:08:06,408
A pastor is like a team manager
to the church.

1186
01:08:06,515 --> 01:08:09,110
You have the choir.
You have the youth group minister.

1187
01:08:09,218 --> 01:08:10,550
You have the congregation.

1188
01:08:10,653 --> 01:08:12,747
The pastor holds all the pieces together,

1189
01:08:12,855 --> 01:08:15,984
gives everybody what they need,
so that the team can win.

1190
01:08:16,092 --> 01:08:19,119
- Okay, Team Church!
- Team Church.

1191
01:08:20,996 --> 01:08:22,464
All right.

1192
01:08:22,565 --> 01:08:24,329
Dad, Chrissy and Alex are
in the car waiting.

1193
01:08:25,701 --> 01:08:26,828
Yes!

1194
01:08:31,807 --> 01:08:33,366
There you go, team manager.

1195
01:08:33,476 --> 01:08:34,500
Thanks.

1196
01:08:39,081 --> 01:08:40,310
Go get 'em!

1197
01:08:40,416 --> 01:08:42,385
Team manager son!

1198
01:08:52,094 --> 01:08:53,892
- Hi, honey.
- Hey.

1199
01:08:55,231 --> 01:08:56,324
You're cooking?

1200
01:08:57,133 --> 01:08:58,157
Can you believe it?

1201
01:08:58,267 --> 01:08:59,735
Where's the fire extinguisher?

1202
01:08:59,835 --> 01:09:02,566
The women from church shared
their favorite recipes with me.

1203
01:09:02,671 --> 01:09:04,299
I never thought I'd enjoy it so much.

1204
01:09:04,406 --> 01:09:07,103
Well, just when I thought
I had seen everything. Listen to this.

1205
01:09:08,878 --> 01:09:11,177
Guess who made
the high school baseball team.

1206
01:09:11,280 --> 01:09:13,511
Honey, do you really think
that's such a good idea?

1207
01:09:13,616 --> 01:09:15,847
I mean, I know you felt really energetic
after your bike ride

1208
01:09:15,951 --> 01:09:18,511
- with Pastor Ezekiel, but this is...
- No, honey, I'm not talking about me.

1209
01:09:18,621 --> 01:09:20,283
- I'm talking about Peter.
- What?

1210
01:09:20,389 --> 01:09:22,790
Assistant manager, just like his old man.

1211
01:09:24,093 --> 01:09:25,527
I didn't see that coming.

1212
01:09:25,628 --> 01:09:27,290
- No.
- No.

1213
01:09:27,396 --> 01:09:29,228
Well, listen, I also have some news.

1214
01:09:29,331 --> 01:09:31,630
Reva asked me
to go into business with her.

1215
01:09:32,501 --> 01:09:34,094
Reva, my secretary, Reva?

1216
01:09:34,203 --> 01:09:39,608
You happen to be looking at Eufala's
one and only fashion consultant.

1217
01:09:40,376 --> 01:09:44,814
Honey, all those years of shopping
are finally paying off.

1218
01:09:46,815 --> 01:09:49,717
Listen, you're not getting
too involved, are you?

1219
01:09:49,818 --> 01:09:52,549
You know as soon as I find a new pastor,
we're out of here.

1220
01:09:52,655 --> 01:09:54,123
I don't want you to get too...

1221
01:09:54,223 --> 01:09:56,590
- Attached?
- Attached.

1222
01:09:56,692 --> 01:09:58,422
Honey, I thought you'd be happy.

1223
01:09:58,527 --> 01:09:59,859
I mean, we're all really trying here.

1224
01:10:02,598 --> 01:10:05,796
Well, you look happier
than a tornado in a trailer park.

1225
01:10:07,369 --> 01:10:09,133
- Tornado in a...
- Trailer park?

1226
01:10:10,105 --> 01:10:12,301
Gosh, I am spending far too much time
with Reva.

1227
01:10:13,042 --> 01:10:14,203
Yeah.

1228
01:10:14,310 --> 01:10:17,712
Well, Chrissy's going to be in the youth
group musical production with me.

1229
01:10:17,813 --> 01:10:19,645
- Really?
- I'm gonna be a cow.

1230
01:10:21,317 --> 01:10:22,615
You have to love the irony.

1231
01:10:24,420 --> 01:10:25,752
Because I'm a vegan.

1232
01:10:25,854 --> 01:10:27,652
- Right. Yeah.
- Yeah.

1233
01:10:30,226 --> 01:10:33,025
Hey. And where are you going?

1234
01:10:33,128 --> 01:10:36,064
I must be dreaming,
so I'm gonna go lay down.

1235
01:10:37,199 --> 01:10:38,724
Congratulations, honey.

1236
01:10:41,370 --> 01:10:42,338
You hungry?

1237
01:10:45,541 --> 01:10:46,474
Here you go.

1238
01:10:46,575 --> 01:10:48,407
- Thank you.
- What's this?

1239
01:10:48,510 --> 01:10:50,502
It's recyclable.

1240
01:10:50,613 --> 01:10:54,243
Yeah, I believe we've got
to, like, cherish this planet

1241
01:10:54,350 --> 01:10:56,444
that God has entrusted to us, you know?

1242
01:10:59,121 --> 01:11:01,647
Right. Do you have any church experience?

1243
01:11:01,757 --> 01:11:03,385
Well, I got this song.

1244
01:11:09,131 --> 01:11:11,600
Cool, cool. Okay.

1245
01:11:11,700 --> 01:11:14,033
<i>Come thy fountain</i>

1246
01:11:14,136 --> 01:11:16,571
<i>Something, something</i>

1247
01:11:16,672 --> 01:11:18,368
<i>And the screams of...</i>

1248
01:11:18,474 --> 01:11:20,875
I have the perfect role
for him in <i>God Star.</i>

1249
01:11:20,976 --> 01:11:22,706
<i>And goodbye horses</i>

1250
01:11:22,811 --> 01:11:23,437
Yes.

1251
01:11:23,545 --> 01:11:25,446
<i>And something</i>

1252
01:11:25,547 --> 01:11:27,106
I know what you're asking yourself.

1253
01:11:28,450 --> 01:11:30,112
How did I get to be so perfect

1254
01:11:30,219 --> 01:11:32,779
to take over
this here church-type establishment place?

1255
01:11:32,888 --> 01:11:34,550
Let me tell you.
I got a 90-minute PowerPoint,

1256
01:11:34,657 --> 01:11:36,250
gonna bring it right here.
We can sit through it.

1257
01:11:39,828 --> 01:11:41,694
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1258
01:11:45,334 --> 01:11:47,963
Not on my watch, you don't.

1259
01:11:49,104 --> 01:11:50,163
Zeke.

1260
01:11:56,011 --> 01:11:58,105
I'll be at the Dairy Queen.

1261
01:12:09,458 --> 01:12:11,222
Everything okay, boss?

1262
01:12:12,795 --> 01:12:14,161
Yeah, I just...

1263
01:12:15,164 --> 01:12:16,462
...thought I saw someone I know.

1264
01:12:16,565 --> 01:12:20,229
Don't worry about it, boss.
We'll find the right person for the job.

1265
01:12:20,336 --> 01:12:22,896
I bet the guy upstairs
already has somebody picked out.

1266
01:12:23,005 --> 01:12:25,702
Somebody who needs to be in Eufala
just as much as we need him here.

1267
01:12:25,808 --> 01:12:28,539
Though... he may not know it yet.

1268
01:12:34,616 --> 01:12:37,347
I had no idea
it was going to be this difficult.

1269
01:12:38,153 --> 01:12:40,622
What? What are you talking about?

1270
01:12:41,890 --> 01:12:43,381
I thought we were doing just fine.

1271
01:12:43,492 --> 01:12:46,121
I mean, the kids have
never been happier, and...

1272
01:12:47,196 --> 01:12:48,789
...I'm really enjoying working with Reva.

1273
01:12:48,897 --> 01:12:51,765
No, honey, I'm talking
about finding the new pastor.

1274
01:12:53,302 --> 01:12:55,271
I mean, you should have been there,
Mary Lou.

1275
01:12:56,271 --> 01:12:58,137
You wouldn't believe these candidates.

1276
01:13:00,242 --> 01:13:04,270
This place is... special. It's different.

1277
01:13:04,380 --> 01:13:08,249
They deserve someone
who is going to take care of them,

1278
01:13:08,350 --> 01:13:12,151
someone who is going
to take the position seriously...

1279
01:13:12,254 --> 01:13:15,656
...not just use it
as a stepping stone to something else.

1280
01:13:18,994 --> 01:13:20,826
Sounds like someone I know.

1281
01:13:30,172 --> 01:13:32,368
Anyone promising in that new batch?

1282
01:13:32,474 --> 01:13:34,204
Not a one, Reva.

1283
01:13:34,309 --> 01:13:37,643
I mean, you'd think there would be
one good candidate

1284
01:13:37,746 --> 01:13:39,840
in this entire bunch,
but there's just not.

1285
01:13:39,948 --> 01:13:41,314
Just don't give up.

1286
01:13:41,417 --> 01:13:44,216
I have this feeling that one of these days
you're gonna wake up

1287
01:13:44,319 --> 01:13:46,652
and find the answer,
clear as the nose on your face.

1288
01:13:47,723 --> 01:13:48,816
Thank you.

1289
01:13:50,559 --> 01:13:52,221
Looking lovely as ever, Reva.

1290
01:13:52,327 --> 01:13:54,091
- Thank you.
- How are you this morning?

1291
01:13:54,196 --> 01:13:57,166
I am finer
than a frog hair split four ways.

1292
01:13:58,367 --> 01:14:01,701
Mind if I have a word
with Pastor Randy here?

1293
01:14:01,804 --> 01:14:04,569
Of course not.
I'll just go check on Danny.

1294
01:14:04,673 --> 01:14:06,835
- Holler if you need me.
- All right.

1295
01:14:06,942 --> 01:14:10,606
I'm going to speak my mind for a moment,

1296
01:14:10,712 --> 01:14:14,376
- if that's all right with you.
- Of course, Pastor.

1297
01:14:14,483 --> 01:14:18,147
I've been watching you
for these past few months,

1298
01:14:18,253 --> 01:14:20,882
and it doesn't take an eagle's eye

1299
01:14:20,989 --> 01:14:24,482
to see that something is troubling you.

1300
01:14:25,494 --> 01:14:26,928
Well...

1301
01:14:27,029 --> 01:14:30,090
...I came to Eufala
with a specific purpose,

1302
01:14:30,199 --> 01:14:34,796
and I just feel like I'm letting you
and the congregation down.

1303
01:14:34,903 --> 01:14:37,429
No, you can't blame yourself for that.

1304
01:14:37,539 --> 01:14:40,099
You can't make a silk purse
out of a sow's ear.

1305
01:14:41,977 --> 01:14:44,242
Never find a diamond in a pile of manure.

1306
01:14:45,414 --> 01:14:46,905
That I understand.

1307
01:14:47,015 --> 01:14:49,348
- All right.
- But what I don't understand is,

1308
01:14:49,451 --> 01:14:52,285
why did God choose me for this task?

1309
01:14:52,387 --> 01:14:53,616
I mean, I'm...

1310
01:14:54,890 --> 01:14:59,225
I'm used to dealing with people that have
a completely different set of problems,

1311
01:14:59,328 --> 01:15:01,888
a completely different set of needs.

1312
01:15:01,997 --> 01:15:04,660
No one knows what God's plan is for us,

1313
01:15:04,766 --> 01:15:09,431
what purpose is hidden
in the things we do in our lives.

1314
01:15:09,538 --> 01:15:13,600
The things that happen to a man
as he plods through his life,

1315
01:15:13,709 --> 01:15:16,975
these are the things that shape
the man he is to become.

1316
01:15:18,747 --> 01:15:23,845
Now, the fact that you have given
your heart and soul to this assignment

1317
01:15:23,952 --> 01:15:28,515
and the love and the devotion
you have for your wife and children,

1318
01:15:28,624 --> 01:15:30,388
these are the things that you've become.

1319
01:15:31,493 --> 01:15:33,860
These are the gifts from God.

1320
01:15:33,962 --> 01:15:37,729
Even if they're not wrapped
in ways we can always see.

1321
01:15:40,068 --> 01:15:43,869
Now, I know that your time here
is diminishing down,

1322
01:15:43,972 --> 01:15:47,534
and it's quite possible
that you will be reassigned

1323
01:15:47,643 --> 01:15:52,513
before you can get the fine folks
of Eufala a proper minister.

1324
01:15:52,614 --> 01:15:53,707
What would happen to the church?

1325
01:15:54,650 --> 01:15:56,778
Well, you don't have a dog in that fight.

1326
01:15:56,885 --> 01:15:58,217
You've done the best you can.

1327
01:15:58,320 --> 01:16:02,815
No, no, no. No, I'm not leaving here
until I find you a new pastor.

1328
01:16:02,925 --> 01:16:05,952
I think that you should give
the sermon next week.

1329
01:16:06,061 --> 01:16:08,496
- I don't...
- Now, don't get me wrong.

1330
01:16:08,597 --> 01:16:11,157
I appreciate everything you've done
organizing the place

1331
01:16:11,266 --> 01:16:14,236
and keeping Danny and Jimmy in check.

1332
01:16:15,470 --> 01:16:16,597
You heard about that?

1333
01:16:16,705 --> 01:16:18,230
Jimmy's eyes are always going to be
a lot wider

1334
01:16:18,340 --> 01:16:21,902
than this church's little budget will
ever be.

1335
01:16:22,010 --> 01:16:27,278
But... folks in this community have grown
quite fond of you and your family.

1336
01:16:27,382 --> 01:16:30,352
And they know
that your time is at a close,

1337
01:16:30,452 --> 01:16:33,422
and they're going to want to hear
what you have to say.

1338
01:16:35,290 --> 01:16:36,815
Can I have some time to think about it?

1339
01:16:36,925 --> 01:16:38,951
Afraid not. Already settled.

1340
01:16:40,028 --> 01:16:41,223
Pastor.

1341
01:16:42,631 --> 01:16:44,156
You take care of yourself.

1342
01:16:45,233 --> 01:16:46,394
Thanks, Pastor.

1343
01:16:48,403 --> 01:16:51,737
Come on. Hurry up. We're going to be late.
I got things to do too.

1344
01:16:53,542 --> 01:16:58,105
I have no idea why a girl as pretty as you
would want to dress like a mortician.

1345
01:16:58,213 --> 01:17:00,045
Look how you dress.

1346
01:17:00,148 --> 01:17:03,346
Sweetie, you'll be very well served
to take a good long look at how I dress.

1347
01:17:03,452 --> 01:17:06,479
The future co-owner
of Reva's Curl Up & Dye Beauty Salon

1348
01:17:06,588 --> 01:17:08,523
has got to look the part.
That's all I'm saying.

1349
01:17:08,624 --> 01:17:10,422
I'm not you!

1350
01:17:10,525 --> 01:17:13,962
Why do you always worry
about what I'm going to do with my future

1351
01:17:14,062 --> 01:17:16,054
when I don't even know what I want to do?

1352
01:17:16,164 --> 01:17:21,159
Sweetie, if you want to be a brain surgeon
or an astrophysicist,

1353
01:17:21,269 --> 01:17:22,897
you better get yourself a scholarship,

1354
01:17:23,005 --> 01:17:25,600
and then Reva will just go
curl up and dye on her own.

1355
01:17:25,707 --> 01:17:28,267
It's not always about you.

1356
01:17:29,211 --> 01:17:31,077
Sometimes it's about me, too.

1357
01:17:32,914 --> 01:17:33,973
I'm sorry.

1358
01:17:38,053 --> 01:17:39,248
Sweetie...

1359
01:17:40,789 --> 01:17:46,023
...I want whatever you want
for yourself, for your future.

1360
01:17:47,195 --> 01:17:49,061
This is what parents do.

1361
01:17:51,533 --> 01:17:53,502
We worry about our kid's dreams.

1362
01:17:56,304 --> 01:17:57,795
Is that so bad?

1363
01:17:58,807 --> 01:17:59,866
It's okay, I guess.

1364
01:18:03,945 --> 01:18:05,607
- Mom...
- Do I have something in my teeth?

1365
01:18:05,714 --> 01:18:06,875
No, Mom!

1366
01:18:09,551 --> 01:18:11,110
On the way to the salon...

1367
01:18:12,554 --> 01:18:16,252
...can we please talk
about what I want to do with my future?

1368
01:18:18,527 --> 01:18:19,995
I'm all ears.

1369
01:18:21,830 --> 01:18:23,662
I'm all ears.

1370
01:18:26,034 --> 01:18:27,627
Pastor Ezekiel is right.

1371
01:18:29,071 --> 01:18:32,007
I think the congregation would love
to hear a sermon from you.

1372
01:18:32,107 --> 01:18:33,735
I don't think
they're gonna take too kindly to me

1373
01:18:33,842 --> 01:18:35,708
when they realize
that I haven't done my job.

1374
01:18:35,811 --> 01:18:37,541
They won't take too kindly?

1375
01:18:38,947 --> 01:18:40,108
Very funny.

1376
01:18:40,215 --> 01:18:42,514
I admit it. Eufala is rubbing off on me.

1377
01:18:46,054 --> 01:18:48,751
I just hope
the pastoral committee gives me more time.

1378
01:18:50,592 --> 01:18:52,220
We have to leave Eufala?

1379
01:18:56,832 --> 01:18:59,392
Come on over, kids. This concerns you.

1380
01:19:03,605 --> 01:19:05,437
We were just starting to like it here.

1381
01:19:05,540 --> 01:19:08,738
- Yeah, where are they gonna send us?
- No telling.

1382
01:19:08,844 --> 01:19:11,336
The church in the old neighborhood
is already closed, so...

1383
01:19:11,446 --> 01:19:14,610
So, we're gonna have to start all over
in a new place?

1384
01:19:14,716 --> 01:19:18,118
We're a family. We stick together.

1385
01:19:20,255 --> 01:19:23,555
<i>Working together, we will</i>

1386
01:19:23,658 --> 01:19:26,150
<i>Carry out His master plan</i>

1387
01:19:26,261 --> 01:19:28,594
<i>Amen</i>

1388
01:19:37,806 --> 01:19:41,868
I know each and every one of you
like the back of my hand.

1389
01:19:41,977 --> 01:19:43,411
Don't deny it.

1390
01:19:44,746 --> 01:19:47,875
You think I'm an old man
who falls asleep in church.

1391
01:19:49,518 --> 01:19:52,955
I have been known to nod off on occasion.

1392
01:19:53,054 --> 01:19:55,546
I miss a verse now and then, but...

1393
01:19:57,325 --> 01:20:01,126
Maybe I should turn
this fine congregation over

1394
01:20:01,229 --> 01:20:04,427
to somebody younger,
somebody with new ideas.

1395
01:20:07,035 --> 01:20:09,834
Don't worry, Ethel.

1396
01:20:09,938 --> 01:20:11,736
Everybody knows it's true.

1397
01:20:13,275 --> 01:20:14,675
It's time.

1398
01:20:16,978 --> 01:20:21,177
Now we've been fortunate
that Pastor Randy has been so generous

1399
01:20:21,283 --> 01:20:24,583
in giving of his time
to help us find a new pastor,

1400
01:20:24,686 --> 01:20:29,522
but... sadly, that time is at hand,

1401
01:20:29,624 --> 01:20:31,456
and he will be leaving us soon.

1402
01:20:32,794 --> 01:20:34,888
Now, I don't know what'll happen

1403
01:20:34,996 --> 01:20:36,965
to our little church community
once he's gone,

1404
01:20:37,065 --> 01:20:40,058
but I do know that each
and every one of us

1405
01:20:40,168 --> 01:20:45,573
are the better for having gotten to know
Pastor Randy and his family.

1406
01:20:47,342 --> 01:20:52,576
And quite possibly,
this might be our last opportunity,

1407
01:20:52,681 --> 01:20:54,946
so with your permission...

1408
01:20:55,050 --> 01:20:58,987
...I have asked Pastor Randy
to give the sermon next week.

1409
01:21:05,093 --> 01:21:06,459
All right, sonny,
what have you got for us?

1410
01:21:06,561 --> 01:21:08,928
Five eighty-nine,
<i>What a Friend We Have in Jesus.</i>

1411
01:21:10,799 --> 01:21:14,167
If I drift off on you, just please know

1412
01:21:14,269 --> 01:21:16,898
that I am surfing on your heavenly voices.

1413
01:21:19,674 --> 01:21:21,734
- Good morning, ladies.
- Morning.

1414
01:21:21,843 --> 01:21:23,971
Do you not know that in a race

1415
01:21:24,079 --> 01:21:26,776
all the runners run,
but only one receives the prize?

1416
01:21:26,882 --> 01:21:29,010
So, run that you may obtain it.

1417
01:21:29,117 --> 01:21:31,143
First Corinthians, 9:24.

1418
01:21:32,220 --> 01:21:34,086
You two are on the team too, huh?

1419
01:21:34,189 --> 01:21:35,589
- Yeah.
- It's all about stamina.

1420
01:21:36,591 --> 01:21:38,890
Mary Louise has changed our world.

1421
01:21:38,994 --> 01:21:40,553
You too, of course, Pastor Randy.

1422
01:21:41,529 --> 01:21:43,896
- That's so sweet, Norma. Thank you.
- Yeah.

1423
01:21:43,999 --> 01:21:45,592
- See you in a couple of hours.
- All right.

1424
01:21:45,700 --> 01:21:48,101
- Bye, sweetie. Have fun. Have fun, girls.
- Okay. Come on, girls.

1425
01:21:48,203 --> 01:21:49,637
- Bye!
- Bye!

1426
01:21:53,041 --> 01:21:54,805
Must be in the country.

1427
01:22:03,218 --> 01:22:05,153
- Hey!
- Hey!

1428
01:22:09,424 --> 01:22:10,756
Hi, how you doing?

1429
01:22:14,195 --> 01:22:15,288
What are you guys doing here?

1430
01:22:15,397 --> 01:22:17,957
- We came to help you pack.
- Surprise!

1431
01:22:18,066 --> 01:22:20,433
Right, well... I don't know what to say.

1432
01:22:20,535 --> 01:22:22,026
Now, don't get all mushy on us.

1433
01:22:22,137 --> 01:22:23,435
It was Tina's idea.

1434
01:22:23,538 --> 01:22:26,406
- We really missed you guys.
- Let's catch up later, okay, guys?

1435
01:22:26,508 --> 01:22:27,669
'Cause he's got a sermon.

1436
01:22:27,776 --> 01:22:28,937
- We'll see you out there.
- Okay.

1437
01:22:29,044 --> 01:22:30,376
We're gonna go find seats.

1438
01:22:32,414 --> 01:22:33,575
Bye, honey.

1439
01:22:40,722 --> 01:22:42,384
Would you relax?

1440
01:22:42,490 --> 01:22:45,392
I swear you are jumpier
than a long-tailed cat

1441
01:22:45,493 --> 01:22:49,430
in a roomful of old ladies
on a sunny afternoon.

1442
01:22:49,531 --> 01:22:51,500
I've never seen you like this.
What's going on, honey bear?

1443
01:22:53,368 --> 01:22:54,734
I'm just nervous, that's all.

1444
01:22:55,737 --> 01:22:57,205
You, nervous?

1445
01:22:57,305 --> 01:23:01,367
Why? What does a big strapping man
like you got to be nervous about?

1446
01:23:01,476 --> 01:23:02,774
Well...

1447
01:23:04,679 --> 01:23:07,513
- ...Pastor Randy.
- I know.

1448
01:23:07,615 --> 01:23:08,878
I know.

1449
01:23:08,984 --> 01:23:12,386
We are all very sad that Pastor Randy
and his family are leaving.

1450
01:23:12,487 --> 01:23:14,888
That's not it.

1451
01:23:14,990 --> 01:23:17,459
Pastor Randy, he asked me to speak
in front of the service this morning.

1452
01:23:18,727 --> 01:23:21,322
- So?
- Well, I mean, I'm just...

1453
01:23:21,429 --> 01:23:24,922
I'm not good at that sort of thing.
What if I mess up or something?

1454
01:23:25,033 --> 01:23:27,867
Sweetie, you stand
in front of that church every Sunday,

1455
01:23:27,969 --> 01:23:29,301
and you lead the choir.

1456
01:23:29,404 --> 01:23:32,067
That's right, I lead the choir.
I don't have to say a word.

1457
01:23:32,173 --> 01:23:36,076
Baby, that's not what you got
all of your boxers in a bunch over.

1458
01:23:36,177 --> 01:23:38,339
Now be honest with me.

1459
01:23:38,446 --> 01:23:40,381
You can tell little Reva.

1460
01:23:44,319 --> 01:23:50,020
Well, I've been watching Pastor Randy
these last couple of months...

1461
01:23:51,192 --> 01:23:55,425
...and I see how much he loves his family.

1462
01:23:57,032 --> 01:23:59,024
And it's got me to thinking.

1463
01:23:59,134 --> 01:24:02,161
I mean, I know how people see me
as this big, tough,

1464
01:24:02,270 --> 01:24:05,297
good-looking, handsome,
king-of-the-road type of guy...

1465
01:24:08,943 --> 01:24:10,935
...but I want what Pastor Randy has.

1466
01:24:12,614 --> 01:24:13,741
I want to settle down.

1467
01:24:13,848 --> 01:24:16,750
Well, you've always got me, haven't you?

1468
01:24:16,851 --> 01:24:19,320
Come on, a girl as pretty as you?

1469
01:24:19,421 --> 01:24:22,152
I mean, I see how guys look at you

1470
01:24:22,257 --> 01:24:24,385
and how you flirt with Officer Barney.

1471
01:24:24,492 --> 01:24:26,620
Why would you want to settle
with a guy like me?

1472
01:24:28,797 --> 01:24:32,564
Now, Jimmy Watkins,
this color green is not good on you.

1473
01:24:33,735 --> 01:24:37,297
All this flirting is just Reva being Reva,

1474
01:24:37,405 --> 01:24:41,342
and expecting me to change is like
asking a leopard to shed his spots.

1475
01:24:45,280 --> 01:24:48,114
But if you're asking to make
an honest woman out of me...

1476
01:24:50,552 --> 01:24:51,520
I am.

1477
01:24:54,055 --> 01:24:55,683
Well, then get down on your knee!

1478
01:24:59,127 --> 01:25:01,722
Now, honey, you give me some sugar.

1479
01:25:04,365 --> 01:25:07,597
And you go out there, and you show them
what Jimmy Watkins is made of.

1480
01:25:21,516 --> 01:25:23,451
Full house to hear your sermon.

1481
01:25:25,320 --> 01:25:26,583
Butterflies?

1482
01:25:28,723 --> 01:25:33,388
I'm more nervous about this sermon
than... I've been in a long time.

1483
01:25:35,196 --> 01:25:36,892
Well, maybe that's a good thing.

1484
01:25:39,400 --> 01:25:42,199
I mean, things had gotten pretty simple
for you back in LA.

1485
01:25:43,805 --> 01:25:45,433
Parishioners...

1486
01:25:46,474 --> 01:25:48,500
...the same questions, the same answers.

1487
01:25:49,811 --> 01:25:53,714
You just didn't have to push yourself,
you know, honey?

1488
01:25:53,815 --> 01:25:57,047
Just kind of... going through the motions.

1489
01:25:57,152 --> 01:25:59,815
I just don't seem to be
reaching this congregation

1490
01:25:59,921 --> 01:26:01,913
the way that I did back in the city.

1491
01:26:03,691 --> 01:26:04,681
Honey...

1492
01:26:06,161 --> 01:26:07,652
...people are people,

1493
01:26:07,762 --> 01:26:10,197
whether you're in the city or the country.

1494
01:26:11,466 --> 01:26:13,901
And we all have the same basic fears...

1495
01:26:15,036 --> 01:26:16,004
...dreams...

1496
01:26:17,138 --> 01:26:18,572
...prayers.

1497
01:26:19,874 --> 01:26:21,570
Only the circumstances are different.

1498
01:26:23,611 --> 01:26:25,512
Speak to that, and you'll do just fine.

1499
01:26:26,614 --> 01:26:27,946
How'd you get so smart?

1500
01:26:28,049 --> 01:26:31,451
I have been listening to your sermons
for more than 12 years, that's how.

1501
01:26:31,553 --> 01:26:33,920
What do you think?
I was reading fashion magazines?

1502
01:26:35,156 --> 01:26:36,488
You should read this.

1503
01:26:39,260 --> 01:26:42,287
<i>A few months ago,</i>
<i>Eufala welcomed Pastor Randy,</i>

1504
01:26:42,397 --> 01:26:44,195
<i>its new interim pastor.</i>

1505
01:26:44,299 --> 01:26:47,497
<i>Many were skeptical</i>
<i>that a pastor used to ministering</i>

1506
01:26:47,602 --> 01:26:52,165
<i>to an inner city congregation</i>
<i>could have any relevance here.</i>

1507
01:26:52,273 --> 01:26:53,798
<i>And I was one of them.</i>

1508
01:26:53,908 --> 01:26:56,104
Keep reading.

1509
01:26:56,211 --> 01:27:00,307
<i>Many didn't see any reason</i>
<i>to give pastor Randy a chance.</i>

1510
01:27:00,415 --> 01:27:04,614
<i>No real obligation</i>
<i>to get to know the man and his family.</i>

1511
01:27:04,719 --> 01:27:09,180
<i>But as local resident</i>
<i>Lila van der Gelder reminds us,</i>

1512
01:27:09,290 --> 01:27:12,192
<i>"That's not how we do things in Eufala,</i>
<i>is it?</i>

1513
01:27:12,293 --> 01:27:16,754
<i>"Truth is, we never know how long</i>
<i>someone's going to be in our lives,</i>

1514
01:27:16,864 --> 01:27:20,926
<i>so we just welcome them</i>
<i>as though it's going to be forever."</i>

1515
01:27:22,670 --> 01:27:25,299
<i>As it turns out in this case,</i>

1516
01:27:25,406 --> 01:27:27,875
<i>it isn't going to be forever.</i>

1517
01:27:27,976 --> 01:27:32,311
<i>Pastor Randy and his family</i>
<i>will leave us in just a few short weeks.</i>

1518
01:27:32,413 --> 01:27:34,541
<i>But I, for one...</i>

1519
01:27:34,649 --> 01:27:39,212
<i>...I am so glad to have known</i>
<i>this wonderful, beautiful family,</i>

1520
01:27:39,320 --> 01:27:41,551
<i>to count them as my friends.</i>

1521
01:27:43,591 --> 01:27:47,323
<i>I suggest Eufala will come to realize</i>
<i>just how fortunate we were</i>

1522
01:27:47,428 --> 01:27:51,661
<i>to have known pastor Randy</i>
<i>and his family as part of our church.</i>

1523
01:27:51,766 --> 01:27:54,463
<i>Even if it is just for a short while.</i>

1524
01:27:55,570 --> 01:27:59,371
<i>Times like this,</i>
<i>we all need a guardian angel.</i>

1525
01:28:05,146 --> 01:28:06,114
Well...

1526
01:28:07,649 --> 01:28:10,380
This is... certainly a surprise.

1527
01:28:10,485 --> 01:28:15,389
I just came to see how things were...
working out for you here.

1528
01:28:15,490 --> 01:28:19,655
Good. Good. Things are...
They're actually working out really well.

1529
01:28:21,996 --> 01:28:25,558
Word is you've turned down
every applicant you've seen thus far.

1530
01:28:27,001 --> 01:28:30,403
- Every one.
- Well, that is because I haven't found

1531
01:28:30,505 --> 01:28:33,805
an applicant that I feel is fit
for this congregation.

1532
01:28:35,410 --> 01:28:36,639
You know...

1533
01:28:37,679 --> 01:28:39,011
You know, Randy.

1534
01:28:40,748 --> 01:28:43,308
Every successful businessman
will tell you that

1535
01:28:43,418 --> 01:28:47,219
reviewing job applicants
is like ordering a pizza.

1536
01:28:47,322 --> 01:28:49,689
Now, there's a million ingredients
you may think

1537
01:28:49,791 --> 01:28:53,057
you want in your perfect pizza,
but the truth is...

1538
01:28:54,562 --> 01:28:56,690
...you probably wouldn't like
the combination.

1539
01:28:58,766 --> 01:29:01,668
I mean, pineapple and jalapeños,

1540
01:29:01,769 --> 01:29:04,170
they probably thought
that was a good idea, right?

1541
01:29:05,106 --> 01:29:08,736
Well, I will find the right person.

1542
01:29:11,212 --> 01:29:13,443
I will. I just need more time.

1543
01:29:13,548 --> 01:29:15,949
You've seen all the applicants.
You've seen them all.

1544
01:29:18,553 --> 01:29:21,648
And since you haven't found
a suitable replacement in the bunch...

1545
01:29:22,590 --> 01:29:24,058
I have six months.

1546
01:29:24,158 --> 01:29:28,095
Randy, I'm afraid the church
is going to be forced to close its doors.

1547
01:29:28,196 --> 01:29:33,863
The congregation will be invited to join
the church all the way in New Calgary.

1548
01:29:33,968 --> 01:29:39,805
No, no, no,
New Calgary is an hour from here, okay?

1549
01:29:39,907 --> 01:29:41,876
These people love this church.

1550
01:29:41,976 --> 01:29:44,844
This community needs this church.

1551
01:30:09,737 --> 01:30:11,137
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1552
01:30:11,239 --> 01:30:13,105
- Hey. Hey.
- Hey.

1553
01:30:15,042 --> 01:30:18,911
So I had the talk with Reva...

1554
01:30:19,013 --> 01:30:22,848
...with my mom, and you were right,

1555
01:30:22,950 --> 01:30:25,579
because she only wants me to be happy.

1556
01:30:25,686 --> 01:30:29,453
Yeah? And what's all this?
I mean, you're normally in black, Alex.

1557
01:30:29,557 --> 01:30:31,685
Yeah, I know, but...

1558
01:30:33,494 --> 01:30:38,091
...it turns out being with my mom
sort of does make me happy.

1559
01:30:38,199 --> 01:30:41,226
- It shows.
- And now that I have a friend in town...

1560
01:30:41,335 --> 01:30:44,464
Yoda. Yeah, she thinks
you're pretty cool too.

1561
01:30:45,907 --> 01:30:48,399
Eufala's looking a whole lot better
to me now.

1562
01:30:51,612 --> 01:30:52,807
Let's pray!

1563
01:30:54,982 --> 01:30:56,280
It's show time.

1564
01:30:57,919 --> 01:30:59,319
You're gonna be great.

1565
01:31:14,368 --> 01:31:16,303
Good morning.

1566
01:31:16,404 --> 01:31:19,568
I would like to start
this morning's sermon

1567
01:31:19,674 --> 01:31:23,042
with something that's quite unpopular
back in the city.

1568
01:31:23,144 --> 01:31:25,272
I want you to turn
to the person in front of you

1569
01:31:25,379 --> 01:31:28,543
and behind you and welcome them.

1570
01:31:28,649 --> 01:31:29,582
When you think about it,

1571
01:31:29,684 --> 01:31:31,744
aren't we all planning
on spending eternity together?

1572
01:31:31,853 --> 01:31:34,448
I figure, let's get a head start.

1573
01:31:34,555 --> 01:31:36,114
Let's get to know each other now.

1574
01:31:39,160 --> 01:31:41,459
When I was thinking
about what I was gonna say

1575
01:31:41,562 --> 01:31:44,259
to you fine people of Eufala this morning,

1576
01:31:44,365 --> 01:31:46,391
a certain panic came over me.

1577
01:31:47,502 --> 01:31:53,305
What wisdom did this city minister have
to impart to you country folk

1578
01:31:53,407 --> 01:31:57,538
who have so graciously welcomed
my family and me into your community?

1579
01:31:58,713 --> 01:32:01,774
Luckily, I have my rock, Mary Louise,

1580
01:32:01,883 --> 01:32:04,819
who reminded me that people are people.

1581
01:32:04,919 --> 01:32:11,120
We all have the same dreams, fears,
desires, questions.

1582
01:32:12,793 --> 01:32:15,092
But we have received so much from you.

1583
01:32:16,130 --> 01:32:18,463
You have taught us city folk

1584
01:32:18,566 --> 01:32:20,831
the true meaning of "love thy neighbor"...

1585
01:32:22,069 --> 01:32:24,265
...what it means to give

1586
01:32:24,372 --> 01:32:27,171
without even thinking
of receiving anything in return,

1587
01:32:27,275 --> 01:32:30,939
about having the courage
to let your guard down

1588
01:32:31,045 --> 01:32:32,911
and live openhearted...

1589
01:32:33,648 --> 01:32:34,946
...to trust one another,

1590
01:32:35,049 --> 01:32:37,814
to greet each other with a smile...

1591
01:32:38,886 --> 01:32:41,446
...to have joy amongst you.

1592
01:32:41,556 --> 01:32:43,047
What a concept.

1593
01:32:43,925 --> 01:32:46,622
It was a bit of an adjustment
for us coming from the city

1594
01:32:46,727 --> 01:32:51,358
where it's survival of the fittest
and every man for himself.

1595
01:32:51,465 --> 01:32:55,561
Eufala for us has been
a blessing from God.

1596
01:32:55,670 --> 01:32:59,004
It's been a lesson
in how to love one another.

1597
01:32:59,907 --> 01:33:02,968
But I wasn't sent here to receive.

1598
01:33:03,077 --> 01:33:05,774
I was sent here with a task.

1599
01:33:05,880 --> 01:33:07,109
To find a replacement

1600
01:33:07,214 --> 01:33:10,651
for the irreplaceable Pastor Zeke
as he retires.

1601
01:33:11,719 --> 01:33:16,419
I stand before you, Eufala,
with that task incomplete.

1602
01:33:17,658 --> 01:33:20,651
I haven't found anyone worthy of you.

1603
01:33:20,761 --> 01:33:23,697
I haven't found anyone

1604
01:33:23,798 --> 01:33:27,235
who will offer you the love
that you offer one another.

1605
01:33:27,335 --> 01:33:31,272
So this morning, I'm reminded of how
the apostles must have felt

1606
01:33:31,372 --> 01:33:36,140
before Jesus performed the miracle
of feeding the 5,000

1607
01:33:36,243 --> 01:33:38,838
with two fish and five loaves.

1608
01:33:40,181 --> 01:33:41,809
Jesus tested them.

1609
01:33:41,916 --> 01:33:45,751
He turned to them and said,
"You feed them."

1610
01:33:47,555 --> 01:33:50,354
Through their faith,
all were provided for.

1611
01:33:51,359 --> 01:33:54,056
And through our faith, we pray...

1612
01:33:55,329 --> 01:33:58,663
...that God will provide the right pastor
for this wonderful church.

1613
01:34:01,369 --> 01:34:03,861
- Give me an amen.
- Amen!

1614
01:34:04,905 --> 01:34:06,567
I hope you don't mind, Pastor Zeke,

1615
01:34:06,674 --> 01:34:08,142
but I've asked a friend of yours

1616
01:34:08,242 --> 01:34:10,541
to prepare something special
for you this morning.

1617
01:34:11,679 --> 01:34:12,806
Jimmy?

1618
01:34:18,452 --> 01:34:19,750
Thanks, Pastor.

1619
01:34:21,389 --> 01:34:22,254
All right.

1620
01:34:25,226 --> 01:34:26,319
Zeke...

1621
01:34:27,595 --> 01:34:29,461
...you've been a part of my life...

1622
01:34:30,765 --> 01:34:34,167
...well, ever since I've been knee-high
to a grasshopper.

1623
01:34:35,169 --> 01:34:37,331
So, I wanted to do something
to show you...

1624
01:34:38,539 --> 01:34:40,030
...how much you mean to me.

1625
01:34:41,709 --> 01:34:42,904
Really, to all of us.

1626
01:34:44,512 --> 01:34:46,811
So, if you don't mind...

1627
01:34:46,914 --> 01:34:51,045
...I'd like the choir to sing
your favorite church song.

1628
01:35:07,401 --> 01:35:10,337
<i>Take off your bandages</i>

1629
01:35:10,438 --> 01:35:14,068
<i>It's time to heal</i>

1630
01:35:14,175 --> 01:35:16,610
<i>So, you can try again</i>

1631
01:35:19,547 --> 01:35:20,845
Wasn't that an awesome sermon?

1632
01:35:20,948 --> 01:35:23,941
Seriously, it's a beautiful day.
Everyone is so happy to be here.

1633
01:35:24,051 --> 01:35:28,079
Could it get any better than this?
I say unto you no way.

1634
01:35:28,189 --> 01:35:31,284
For heaven's sake.
This is church, young man.

1635
01:35:31,392 --> 01:35:33,020
- We're not in heaven yet.
- Yeah.

1636
01:35:33,127 --> 01:35:37,189
Save some of that enthusiasm
for the after-party.

1637
01:35:38,666 --> 01:35:40,225
Just show me. What is it?

1638
01:35:40,334 --> 01:35:41,734
You're never going to believe this.

1639
01:35:41,836 --> 01:35:45,170
You and your wife can be very inspiring.

1640
01:35:45,272 --> 01:35:46,968
- You two?
- Yeah!

1641
01:35:47,975 --> 01:35:50,206
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

1642
01:35:50,311 --> 01:35:52,473
- That's wonderful.
- Hey, Pastor Randy,

1643
01:35:52,580 --> 01:35:55,812
I know what you're thinking, too.
That there is a real diamond.

1644
01:35:55,916 --> 01:35:58,351
I wouldn't doubt it, Jimmy.

1645
01:35:58,452 --> 01:36:00,546
- Let's go show it off.
- We got to show everybody, Pastor Randy.

1646
01:36:00,654 --> 01:36:01,815
All right.

1647
01:36:01,922 --> 01:36:06,018
Thank you very much for coming.
Thank you. Thank you for coming.

1648
01:36:06,127 --> 01:36:07,595
Come back now.

1649
01:36:07,695 --> 01:36:09,823
That was a beautiful sermon, Randy.

1650
01:36:09,930 --> 01:36:13,230
Thank you. It meant so much to me
to have you guys here.

1651
01:36:14,769 --> 01:36:15,828
What did you think, Joe?

1652
01:36:17,071 --> 01:36:18,835
Not bad. Who knew you had it in you?

1653
01:36:18,939 --> 01:36:22,239
Well, you know, if you'd ever show up
to church every once in a while...

1654
01:36:22,343 --> 01:36:24,335
Yeah, yeah. Come on, T.
I need a cup of Joe.

1655
01:36:24,445 --> 01:36:26,641
- Good to see you.
- Good to see you.

1656
01:36:27,481 --> 01:36:29,950
And then Sunday is pancake day.

1657
01:36:30,050 --> 01:36:31,450
- Yeah?
- I love pancake day.

1658
01:36:31,552 --> 01:36:33,350
Yeah, I like pancakes too.

1659
01:36:33,454 --> 01:36:36,356
Hey. Rain, he came all the way
from Los Angeles

1660
01:36:36,457 --> 01:36:38,619
just to hear your sermon.
Isn't that awesome?

1661
01:36:38,726 --> 01:36:41,753
Had to see what wonderful place
you landed in, my friend.

1662
01:36:43,330 --> 01:36:46,823
Eufala? Wonderful?

1663
01:36:46,934 --> 01:36:48,732
I'm not sure I'd go that far.

1664
01:36:48,836 --> 01:36:51,032
Well, no, I mean look around

1665
01:36:51,138 --> 01:36:53,835
at all these wonderful people
in your life, sunshine.

1666
01:36:53,941 --> 01:36:56,877
I mean, the folks
who really care about you,

1667
01:36:56,977 --> 01:37:01,005
- your dreams, your worries.
- Yeah.

1668
01:37:01,115 --> 01:37:02,879
See now...

1669
01:37:02,983 --> 01:37:06,215
Now, that's what makes
Eufala special, Alex. Real special.

1670
01:37:07,688 --> 01:37:09,054
Don't ever forget that.

1671
01:37:09,156 --> 01:37:12,684
This was part of your plan,
all along, wasn't it?

1672
01:37:12,793 --> 01:37:15,126
Well, not just mine...

1673
01:37:16,397 --> 01:37:17,660
...but yes.

1674
01:37:19,066 --> 01:37:22,559
Okay, well, I promised
to get Rain some coffee and...

1675
01:37:22,670 --> 01:37:25,469
- Please.
- All right. And a donut, right?

1676
01:37:25,573 --> 01:37:27,474
- Yes, yes. Sprinkles on top?
- Yeah.

1677
01:37:27,575 --> 01:37:28,770
- Strawberry?
- Yes.

1678
01:37:40,955 --> 01:37:43,515
Turquoise? Turquoise? Really?

1679
01:37:46,327 --> 01:37:49,263
Hey, Dad, is it okay
if I go over to Alex's later

1680
01:37:49,363 --> 01:37:51,127
if I promise to stay up
all night and pack?

1681
01:37:51,232 --> 01:37:52,393
I thought you and Alex...

1682
01:37:52,499 --> 01:37:54,661
Yeah, she comes off
madder than a wet hen...

1683
01:37:54,768 --> 01:37:56,259
"Madder than a wet hen"?

1684
01:37:56,370 --> 01:37:58,362
Yeah, apparently,
that's how we all talk now.

1685
01:37:59,440 --> 01:38:03,104
Okay, look, I just mean
once you get past her tough exterior,

1686
01:38:03,210 --> 01:38:04,234
she's all right.

1687
01:38:04,345 --> 01:38:07,440
And later, I'm gonna go down
to the ball field for batting practice.

1688
01:38:09,884 --> 01:38:12,410
- What, I can't turn into a jock?
- No!

1689
01:38:12,519 --> 01:38:14,044
Yes, you can.

1690
01:38:15,256 --> 01:38:16,781
Mary Louise, can I talk to you?

1691
01:38:16,891 --> 01:38:18,723
- Just for a second?
- Sure.

1692
01:38:23,664 --> 01:38:26,156
- Yeah, babe?
- How much do you like it here?

1693
01:38:27,368 --> 01:38:28,734
Well, you can't blame him really.

1694
01:38:28,836 --> 01:38:31,931
I mean, he doesn't have
the sense God gave lettuce.

1695
01:38:32,039 --> 01:38:32,972
Pastor Ezekiel.

1696
01:38:33,073 --> 01:38:34,701
- Hey.
- Hey.

1697
01:38:34,808 --> 01:38:37,437
Widow Smythe... Mrs. Smythe.

1698
01:38:38,646 --> 01:38:41,810
I would like to recuse myself
from the panel

1699
01:38:41,916 --> 01:38:44,385
of reviewing the candidates
for your replacement.

1700
01:38:44,485 --> 01:38:46,477
What for? I thought
that's the reason you came here.

1701
01:38:57,364 --> 01:39:00,459
- What's this?
- That's my resume.

1702
01:39:00,567 --> 01:39:04,095
I'd like to be considered
as a candidate for the new pastor.

1703
01:39:05,239 --> 01:39:07,674
Well, I'll have to take it
into consideration.

1704
01:39:09,643 --> 01:39:11,373
All right, I've considered it.

1705
01:39:11,478 --> 01:39:13,379
This congregation would be very fortunate

1706
01:39:13,480 --> 01:39:16,109
to have you and your family
as our new pastor.

1707
01:39:17,251 --> 01:39:18,184
Welcome home, son.

1708
01:39:23,057 --> 01:39:25,891
Don't snap his head off.
He's our new pastor.

1709
01:39:29,630 --> 01:39:31,792
Don't disappoint me, young man.

1710
01:39:38,339 --> 01:39:42,504
It was <i>Love Me Tender,</i>
not <i>Girls! Girls! Girls!</i>

1711
01:39:48,449 --> 01:39:51,510
Kids, welcome to Eufala.

1712
01:39:52,586 --> 01:39:54,418
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1713
01:39:59,994 --> 01:40:04,056
<i>I gotta get all these animals on a boat</i>

1714
01:40:05,766 --> 01:40:10,067
<i>But they're so big</i>
<i>I don't think it'll float</i>

1715
01:40:11,405 --> 01:40:15,900
<i>I got two elephants,</i>
<i>giraffes, and giant apes</i>

1716
01:40:17,444 --> 01:40:21,506
<i>With all these beasts in here</i>
<i>It really don't smell great</i>

1717
01:40:23,484 --> 01:40:27,649
<i>We gotta clean up</i>
<i>all these messes really fast</i>

1718
01:40:29,189 --> 01:40:33,490
<i>Or my family won't enjoy their noon repast</i>

1719
01:40:35,195 --> 01:40:39,223
<i>My son, my daughter,</i>
<i>and my wife are here with me</i>

1720
01:40:40,734 --> 01:40:44,603
<i>No, we lost another chimpanzee</i>

1721
01:40:46,206 --> 01:40:48,607
<i>We gotta have two of everything</i>

1722
01:40:48,709 --> 01:40:50,575
<i>'Cause if we don't have two of everything</i>

1723
01:40:50,677 --> 01:40:55,172
<i>Then God'll be mad, and it won't work</i>
<i>And we can't repopulate the Earth</i>

1724
01:40:55,282 --> 01:40:56,978
<i>And then it'll be my dearth</i>

1725
01:40:57,084 --> 01:41:01,215
<i>I wanna save all the birds and the bees</i>

1726
01:41:02,523 --> 01:41:06,858
<i>But I can't stand that</i>
<i>we have so many monkeys</i>

1727
01:41:08,228 --> 01:41:12,427
<i>Gorillas, orangutans,</i>
<i>capuchins, apes, and so</i>

1728
01:41:13,934 --> 01:41:18,167
<i>With all this screeching</i>
<i>They really gotta go</i>

1729
01:41:19,673 --> 01:41:24,077
<i>We got insects like</i>
<i>the cockroaches and ants</i>

1730
01:41:25,512 --> 01:41:29,608
<i>Don't this song make you want</i>
<i>to get right up and dance?</i>

1731
01:41:30,584 --> 01:41:31,916
<i>Dance break</i>

1732
01:41:32,786 --> 01:41:34,084
<i>Dance break</i>

1733
01:41:35,622 --> 01:41:37,113
<i>Dance break</i>

1734
01:41:42,463 --> 01:41:43,897
<i>Dance break</i>

1735
01:41:49,002 --> 01:41:50,197
<i>Dance break</i>

1736
01:41:56,110 --> 01:42:00,445
<i>Donkeys, horses,</i>
<i>and the zebra are all here</i>

1737
01:42:02,249 --> 01:42:05,185
<i>Wait a minute</i>
<i>Some have antlers</i>

1738
01:42:06,019 --> 01:42:07,385
<i>Reindeer</i>

1739
01:42:08,489 --> 01:42:12,722
<i>Getting the dinosaurs aboard</i>
<i>was tried in vain</i>

1740
01:42:14,128 --> 01:42:16,393
<i>And now it's way too late</i>

1741
01:42:16,497 --> 01:42:18,830
<i>Because here comes the rain</i>

1742
01:42:22,936 --> 01:42:24,632
No, really! Everyone on board now!

1743
01:42:24,738 --> 01:42:26,070
I'm not kidding! Man the hatches!

1744
01:42:26,173 --> 01:42:28,369
Batten down the hatches! Man the jib!

1745
01:42:28,475 --> 01:42:30,307
Okay, gotta get aboard!
