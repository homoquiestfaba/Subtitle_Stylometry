00:00:49,717 --> 00:00:53,587
VALERIE: They think we're
strangers, Isaac.

4
00:00:53,621 --> 00:00:56,791
(Echoing)
Trust me.

5
00:00:58,392 --> 00:01:02,295
(Birds chirping in background)

6
00:01:02,329 --> 00:01:03,831
Hey.

7
00:01:03,865 --> 00:01:06,668
Yo, why'd you fucking drag me
out here?

8
00:01:06,701 --> 00:01:08,836
My knee's killin' me,
I'm having surgery on Monday.

9
00:01:08,870 --> 00:01:10,104
What the fuck?

10
00:01:10,138 --> 00:01:12,572
JIMMY: Why couldn't you just
do it like the rest of 'em?

11
00:01:12,607 --> 00:01:14,976
Wh... what?
What the fuck does that mean?

12
00:01:15,009 --> 00:01:18,211
You dope, you win.

13
00:01:18,245 --> 00:01:21,716
I won, a lot, okay?

14
00:01:21,749 --> 00:01:22,717
Clean.

15
00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:24,551
I lost clean.

16
00:01:24,584 --> 00:01:25,585
You see what happens
to these guys

17
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:26,520
when they get fuckin' busted?

18
00:01:28,321 --> 00:01:30,692
I... I retired ages ago,
I don't get this.

19
00:01:30,725 --> 00:01:31,826
Why... why... why now?

20
00:01:31,859 --> 00:01:32,894
You were a sure thing, man.

21
00:01:32,927 --> 00:01:35,495
Even if you lost,
I'd make it back the next time.

22
00:01:35,529 --> 00:01:36,798
Only there wasn't
another next time

23
00:01:36,831 --> 00:01:38,465
and I can't pay them anymore.

24
00:01:38,498 --> 00:01:39,901
They're bleeding me, Rick.

25
00:01:39,934 --> 00:01:42,235
Why didn't you tell me this
sooner?

26
00:01:42,269 --> 00:01:45,272
After the injury,
things got different.

27
00:01:45,305 --> 00:01:47,809
I didn't wanna lay
all my baggage onto you, so I...

28
00:01:47,842 --> 00:01:48,710
RICK:
Who?

29
00:01:48,743 --> 00:01:49,977
Who do you owe?

30
00:01:50,011 --> 00:01:52,512
(Birds chirping in background)

31
00:01:52,546 --> 00:01:54,682

37
00:04:07,882 --> 00:04:09,116
- Boo!
- Shit.

38
00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:11,853
- Hey, man.
- Ooh, wow!

39
00:04:11,886 --> 00:04:14,155
I was startin' to think
you got lost.

40
00:04:14,188 --> 00:04:16,423
I... I... you know,
I haven't been to the new place

41
00:04:16,456 --> 00:04:17,490
very many times.

42
00:04:17,524 --> 00:04:18,525
RICK:
Really?

43
00:04:18,558 --> 00:04:22,797
I... I moved here right...
right after the injury.

44
00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:23,898
ISAAC:
Oh, yeah.

45
00:04:23,931 --> 00:04:25,733
Um, well, I might have been
to some of the parties

46
00:04:25,766 --> 00:04:27,101
you threw when you uh,
started the team,

47
00:04:27,134 --> 00:04:29,904
but I don't remember,
maybe I got a ride.

48
00:04:29,937 --> 00:04:31,072
Probably got a ride
or somethin'.

49
00:04:31,105 --> 00:04:33,641
ISAAC:
Fucked up.

50
00:04:33,674 --> 00:04:36,143
- Um, cheers.
- ISAAC: Cheers.

51
00:04:36,177 --> 00:04:38,779
Well, I'm thinking uh,
diggin' the...

52
00:04:38,813 --> 00:04:39,914
You like that?

53
00:04:39,947 --> 00:04:41,115
(Chuckles)

54
00:04:41,148 --> 00:04:42,582
- ISAAC: New, right?
- I know.

55
00:04:42,617 --> 00:04:44,051
You can barely see me, right?

56
00:04:44,085 --> 00:04:47,420
Well, since uh, you made me
team captain and all that,

57
00:04:47,454 --> 00:04:48,723
figured you'd wanna talk
about the season.

58
00:04:48,756 --> 00:04:50,590
(Chuckles)
No.

59
00:04:50,625 --> 00:04:54,061
No, I... I don't actually
wanna talk about that, but...

60
00:04:55,462 --> 00:04:56,563
(Slurps)

61
00:04:56,596 --> 00:04:57,530
(Gulps)

62
00:05:02,904 --> 00:05:04,205
Well, how's the knee doing?

63
00:05:04,238 --> 00:05:06,741
Ugh, really?

64
00:05:06,774 --> 00:05:08,976
What the f... I just...

65
00:05:09,010 --> 00:05:12,046
I wanted to have a drink
with a friend

66
00:05:12,079 --> 00:05:14,148
and shoot the shit...

67
00:05:14,181 --> 00:05:16,150
And you had to fuckin'...

68
00:05:16,183 --> 00:05:17,919
ISAAC:
All right.

69
00:05:17,952 --> 00:05:20,121

70
00:05:20,154 --> 00:05:30,064
(♪♪♪)

71
00:05:38,873 --> 00:05:41,108
Wait a second, no, no, no.

72
00:05:41,142 --> 00:05:43,844
Don't t...

73
00:05:43,878 --> 00:05:47,648
Uh, wait, are you...
are you one of those people?

74
00:05:49,183 --> 00:05:50,483
(Chuckles)

75
00:05:50,517 --> 00:05:51,819
What do you mean? What?

76
00:05:51,852 --> 00:05:53,821
I don't know,
like the kinda people

77
00:05:53,854 --> 00:05:55,990
that get all
like antsy around guns.

78
00:05:56,023 --> 00:05:58,092
- ISAAC: No. Not at all.
- No.

79
00:05:58,125 --> 00:06:01,128
No, I've been... I've actually
been shooting before.

80
00:06:01,162 --> 00:06:02,529
(Chuckles)

81
00:06:02,562 --> 00:06:03,998
I've been riding for you for...

82
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:05,032
RICK:
For what?

83
00:06:05,066 --> 00:06:07,068
For what? Like a year
and a half now and uh...

84
00:06:07,101 --> 00:06:07,902
RICK:
Relax!

85
00:06:07,935 --> 00:06:09,870
W... why are you like

86
00:06:09,904 --> 00:06:12,273
all fuckin' wound tight
and shit?

87
00:06:12,306 --> 00:06:15,076
It's not loaded,
so don't go freakin' out.

88
00:06:15,109 --> 00:06:17,645
(Phone rings)

89
00:06:17,678 --> 00:06:19,213
I gotta take this really quick,
like it... it's my boss.

90
00:06:19,246 --> 00:06:21,682
What? I'm your fuckin' boss!

91
00:06:21,716 --> 00:06:24,151
Hey, it's like
a potential sponsor, you know?

92
00:06:24,185 --> 00:06:25,686
I gotta...
I'll be back in a few minutes.

93
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:27,254
Wait, wait, are you...
wait, are you che...

94
00:06:27,288 --> 00:06:29,991
Are... are you...
are you cheating on me?

95
00:06:30,024 --> 00:06:31,659
He's from France,
you don't know him.

96
00:06:31,692 --> 00:06:33,526
- RICK: I...
- (Chuckles)

97
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:35,629
I fuckin' hate France!

98
00:06:39,266 --> 00:06:41,168

102
00:06:59,153 --> 00:07:01,288
What the fuck did you say
to him?

103
00:07:01,322 --> 00:07:02,723
He's been pounding scotch,

104
00:07:02,757 --> 00:07:04,692
making all these
infidelity jokes.

105
00:07:04,725 --> 00:07:08,561
(Taking deep breaths)

106
00:07:08,595 --> 00:07:10,831
He knows something.

107
00:07:10,865 --> 00:07:12,133
Please just refrain
from fucking us over

108
00:07:12,166 --> 00:07:14,068
for one more hour.

109
00:07:14,101 --> 00:07:16,604
Can you do that?

110
00:07:16,637 --> 00:07:19,140
He's completely fucked!

111
00:07:19,173 --> 00:07:21,574

112
00:07:21,609 --> 00:07:31,318
(♪♪♪)

113
00:07:37,925 --> 00:07:39,627
Well, I can't keep this shit up.

(Chuckles)

115
00:07:40,494 --> 00:07:41,829
Not at the rate
he's been drinking

116
00:07:41,862 --> 00:07:42,930
and the things he's been saying.

117
00:07:42,963 --> 00:07:45,633
You need to stop
being a fucking pussy.

118
00:07:45,666 --> 00:07:47,168
The dude is on a fucking bender!

119
00:07:52,339 --> 00:07:54,942
You need to get out of there.

120
00:07:54,975 --> 00:07:57,878
Let's... let's not meet back
at my place.

121
00:07:57,912 --> 00:08:00,347
Screw that.

122
00:08:00,381 --> 00:08:01,749
Bring the shit over here

123
00:08:01,782 --> 00:08:07,388
and we're gonna leave sooner,
okay?

124
00:08:07,421 --> 00:08:10,324
It's going to be fine,
it's going to be fine.

125
00:08:10,357 --> 00:08:12,359
Trust me, okay?

ISAAC:
What... what's going on?

134
00:09:27,134 --> 00:09:29,336
I thought you were gonna fall
in the shitter.

(Chuckles)

136
00:09:30,204 --> 00:09:31,972
Ain't nothing wrong with me,
alright?

Fucking great.

138
00:09:33,307 --> 00:09:35,442
I'm three for three.

139
00:09:35,476 --> 00:09:37,077
And it's your turn, pussy.

140
00:09:37,111 --> 00:09:40,014
Uh, are you sure
you wanna be shooting out here?

141
00:09:40,047 --> 00:09:42,917
- You know... (Chuckles)
- What're you talkin' about?

142
00:09:42,950 --> 00:09:45,819
- Hey, we're friends, right?
- ISAAC: Yeah.

143
00:09:45,853 --> 00:09:48,122
Fuckin' friends shoot guns
together.

144
00:09:48,155 --> 00:09:49,823
It's what they do.

145
00:09:49,857 --> 00:09:51,192
I don't want you
gettin' in trouble, alright?

146
00:09:51,225 --> 00:09:52,860
- (Chuckles)
- Don't worry about me.

147
00:09:54,428 --> 00:09:57,131
You're hidin' somethin'.

148
00:09:57,164 --> 00:09:57,932
ISAAC:
I'm not hiding anything, man.

149
00:09:57,965 --> 00:10:00,067
I know.
Come on, do what you got!

150

We're all out of bottles.

(Chuckles)

164
00:10:42,176 --> 00:10:44,111

All right, just uh... I got that.

Well, you can't...
you can't just go

taking things from you?

Oh, no, just...
it's just a little observation

I've been makin' lately.

182
00:11:15,342 --> 00:11:18,145
It seems that you like
to take things from me.

183
00:11:18,178 --> 00:11:21,248
Well, just... just a feeling.

184
00:11:21,282 --> 00:11:22,950
Well, I don't know
what it is you're feeling, Rick.

He's a total fucking mess.

207
00:12:52,206 --> 00:12:55,109
He could be a problem.

208
00:12:55,142 --> 00:12:57,978

I need your help, okay?

You help me and I'll help you

Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
slow down.

233
00:14:41,114 --> 00:14:42,049
Tell me what happened.

234
00:14:42,082 --> 00:14:43,550
It's fuckin' over, man.

235

W... what did you do?

236
00:14:44,585 --> 00:14:48,222
I can't help you
if I don't know what you did.

237
00:14:48,255 --> 00:14:49,724
It's Isaac and Valerie, okay?

238
00:14:49,757 --> 00:14:50,792
It was an accident.

239
00:14:50,825 --> 00:14:52,259
They're... they're fuckin' dead.

240
00:14:55,095 --> 00:14:58,432
And when I ran, I... I ran,
I got into Valerie's car...

241
00:14:58,465 --> 00:14:59,500
Fuck!

242
00:14:59,533 --> 00:15:01,568
I got into my car

243
00:15:01,603 --> 00:15:03,437
and there was a fuckin' bag
in there...

244
00:15:06,206 --> 00:15:08,676
They're rippin' me off, man.

245
00:15:14,081 --> 00:15:18,552
Jimmy, you know,
I would never hurt Val.

246
00:15:18,585 --> 00:15:22,256
Um, well, my advice would be
to go to the cops,

247
00:15:22,289 --> 00:15:23,423
but you ran already

248
00:15:23,457 --> 00:15:25,392
and that's not
a very smart move, buddy.

249
00:15:25,425 --> 00:15:28,362
I... I'm just...
I'm drivin' around, okay?

250
00:15:28,395 --> 00:15:30,364
I don't know
where the fuck I am.

251
00:15:30,397 --> 00:15:32,065
Please, man, please.

252
00:15:32,099 --> 00:15:36,638
So you should probably go
to a friend's house and...

253
00:15:36,671 --> 00:15:39,072
And lie low for a little bit.

254
00:15:39,106 --> 00:15:41,141

358
00:25:41,842 --> 00:25:45,079
<i>Uh, kinda need a favor.</i>

359
00:25:45,112 --> 00:25:47,348
(Door buzzes)

360
00:25:50,151 --> 00:25:51,986
(Whirring)

361
00:25:52,019 --> 00:25:53,454
Whoa!

362
00:25:53,487 --> 00:25:55,089
Ha-ha!

363
00:25:55,122 --> 00:25:57,057
(Grunts)

364
00:25:57,091 --> 00:25:58,259
Malcolm!

365
00:25:58,292 --> 00:26:00,794
Rick, how are you?

366
00:26:00,828 --> 00:26:02,830
(Chuckles)

367
00:26:02,863 --> 00:26:05,966
Uh, fuck, I've been better.

368
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:09,737
Just uh, just lookin' for a...
a familiar place to stay.

369
00:26:10,871 --> 00:26:12,940
Oh, not to worry,
we've all been there.

370
00:26:12,973 --> 00:26:13,841
(Chuckles)

371
00:26:13,874 --> 00:26:15,342
You need help
with any of those bags?

372
00:26:15,376 --> 00:26:17,144
RICK:
No, I'm okay, it's uh...

373
00:26:17,178 --> 00:26:19,480
(Rick grunts)

374
00:26:19,513 --> 00:26:20,915
Just this.

375
00:26:20,948 --> 00:26:23,284
Ah,
just the bare necessities, huh.

376
00:26:23,317 --> 00:26:25,186
Gym bag and a mystery package.

377
00:26:26,854 --> 00:26:29,223
Is that a gift in exchange
for my hospitality?

378
00:26:29,256 --> 00:26:30,824
(Chuckles)

379
00:26:30,858 --> 00:26:33,961
No, I just uh,
I grabbed what I could.

380
00:26:35,763 --> 00:26:38,265
Uh, yeah, I don't think
it's gonna work out w...

381
00:26:38,299 --> 00:26:40,901
With me and Val.

382
00:26:40,935 --> 00:26:44,104
Things went south pretty quick.

383
00:26:44,138 --> 00:26:46,740
Oh, I'm really sorry, man.

384
00:26:46,774 --> 00:26:48,175
Get in here, huh?

385
00:26:48,209 --> 00:26:58,118
(♪♪♪)

386
00:27:04,992 --> 00:27:08,128
Yeah, hope you don't mind,
but I have a bit of company.

387
00:27:12,166 --> 00:27:15,302
Looks like someone
had a bit too much.

388
00:27:18,539 --> 00:27:22,443
What's the uh...
what's the occasion?

389
00:27:22,476 --> 00:27:25,279
I mean for the party?

390
00:27:25,312 --> 00:27:29,083
Oh, I uh,
just played at the grand opening

391
00:27:29,116 --> 00:27:31,051
of a new club last night.

392
00:27:31,085 --> 00:27:33,254
Real wild shit, you know?

393
00:27:39,593 --> 00:27:41,895
Yeah.

394
00:27:41,929 --> 00:27:43,063
(Sighs)

395
00:27:43,097 --> 00:27:44,999
Wild is right.

396
00:27:50,471 --> 00:27:51,572
(Chuckles)

397
00:27:51,606 --> 00:27:54,208
And the party followed me here.

398
00:27:54,241 --> 00:27:56,844
As you can see there's
no shortage of beautiful dames.

399
00:27:59,980 --> 00:28:01,482
But enough of that.

400
00:28:01,515 --> 00:28:03,183
Let's show you
to your sleeping quarters,

401
00:28:03,217 --> 00:28:04,385
good sir.

402
00:28:12,426 --> 00:28:14,395
MALCOLM: (Chuckles)
I've missed you, Rick.

403
00:28:14,428 --> 00:28:16,196
This really is a nice surprise.

404
00:28:16,230 --> 00:28:19,833
Yeah, I uh...
I wish the circumstances were...

405
00:28:19,867 --> 00:28:21,335
Were better.

406
00:28:21,368 --> 00:28:24,238
I mean maybe tomorrow,
after breakfast,

407
00:28:24,271 --> 00:28:26,840
we... we can catch up.

408
00:28:26,874 --> 00:28:28,842
I'm fuckin' wrecked, man,
I gotta hit the sack.

409
00:28:28,876 --> 00:28:31,512
That's totally cool,
perfectly fine.

410
00:28:31,545 --> 00:28:34,815
Now let's see here.
What's behind door number one?

411
00:28:35,449 --> 00:28:37,384
(Woman grunting)

412
00:28:41,188 --> 00:28:42,823
Moving on.

413
00:28:45,025 --> 00:28:47,961
Ah, that's more like it.

414
00:28:47,995 --> 00:28:49,430
Sorry about that.

415
00:28:49,463 --> 00:28:51,432
This place can turn
into quite the love shack.

416
00:28:51,465 --> 00:28:53,100
Yeah.

417
00:28:53,133 --> 00:28:54,068
Yeah.

418
00:28:54,101 --> 00:29:00,240
Uh, fuck, the last couple hours

419
00:29:00,274 --> 00:29:04,378
um, you know, I...
I didn't even see it comin'.

420
00:29:04,411 --> 00:29:07,081
Yeah, if you
don't mind me prying a bit,

421
00:29:07,114 --> 00:29:08,349
what happened with you
and Valerie?

422
00:29:12,152 --> 00:29:14,121
She was fuckin' my team captain.

423
00:29:16,256 --> 00:29:18,892
Captain of the fuckin' team
that I own.

424
00:29:18,926 --> 00:29:21,095
Yeah, that's heavy.

425
00:29:21,128 --> 00:29:24,565
Yeah, and uh, I don't know, I...

426
00:29:24,598 --> 00:29:26,967
It didn't end...
it didn't end pretty,

427
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:30,304
but that... that's another story.

428
00:29:30,337 --> 00:29:34,208
Well, if it's any consolation,
I was never a big fan.

429
00:29:34,241 --> 00:29:36,009
(Scoffs)

430
00:29:36,043 --> 00:29:39,480
Uh, yes, it's... it's good
to have somebody on my side.

431
00:29:39,513 --> 00:29:42,049
Hmm, you want my advice?

432
00:29:42,082 --> 00:29:45,119
Take a shower
and get some shut-eye.

433
00:29:45,152 --> 00:29:47,287
I'll see you in the morning.

434
00:29:47,321 --> 00:29:49,556
Now if you need anything,
I'm just down the hall.

435
00:29:49,590 --> 00:29:51,225
Thanks.

436
00:29:51,258 --> 00:29:54,328
Oh, and uh,
knock first if you do.

437
00:29:54,361 --> 00:29:56,130
(Grunts)

438
00:30:02,136 --> 00:30:05,072
(Oscar laughing)

439
00:30:14,649 --> 00:30:24,558
(♪♪♪)

440
00:30:36,604 --> 00:30:38,172
(Knocking on door)

441
00:30:57,458 --> 00:30:59,694
JIMMY:
This is Dr. J.

442
00:30:59,727 --> 00:31:01,195
Hi, doctor,
I'm with the police.

443
00:31:01,228 --> 00:31:02,563
I need to ask you
a couple of things.

444
00:31:06,133 --> 00:31:07,434
Are you a cop or a detective?

445
00:31:10,537 --> 00:31:12,172
Detective.

446
00:31:12,206 --> 00:31:13,273
Do you mind if I come in?

447
00:31:17,411 --> 00:31:19,346
It's a little too late
for a house call.

448
00:31:19,379 --> 00:31:20,981
<i>Not that I do house calls,
but...</i>

449
00:31:24,117 --> 00:31:26,654
<i>Yeah, give me two minutes.</i>

450
00:31:28,756 --> 00:31:30,257
Alright, I'll wait.

451
00:31:31,258 --> 00:31:32,359
How can I help you?

452
00:31:32,392 --> 00:31:36,129
Your patient, friend,
Rick Van Pelt.

453
00:31:38,465 --> 00:31:40,033
You know where he is?

454
00:31:40,067 --> 00:31:41,368
JIMMY:
Not at the moment.

455
00:31:41,401 --> 00:31:45,072
I last spoke to him
this afternoon.

456
00:31:45,105 --> 00:31:46,708
Hmm, where exactly was that?

457
00:31:46,741 --> 00:31:48,643
We played a couple of rounds
together.

458
00:31:48,676 --> 00:31:51,278
Uh, can I ask
what all this is about?

459
00:31:51,311 --> 00:31:52,379
You know,
something serious went down

460
00:31:52,412 --> 00:31:54,047
at Rick's place tonight.

461
00:31:54,081 --> 00:31:55,516
A couple of people are dead.

462
00:31:55,549 --> 00:31:56,818
Close associates.

463
00:31:56,851 --> 00:31:58,285
- So now I'm...
- Oh, Jesus Christ!

464
00:31:58,318 --> 00:32:00,087
Do I need to have
a fucking lawyer here?

465
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:00,989
Doctor, listen to me.

466
00:32:01,054 --> 00:32:03,056
I'm not here to incriminate you
or Rick.

467
00:32:03,090 --> 00:32:04,692
I'm just here to find out
what happened.

468
00:32:04,726 --> 00:32:05,793
And why.

469
00:32:10,163 --> 00:32:11,598
Can we help each other?

470
00:32:17,371 --> 00:32:19,473
Well,
it is of my professional opinion

471
00:32:19,506 --> 00:32:22,576
that Rick is not capable
of murdering anybody.

472
00:32:25,212 --> 00:32:26,781
If you change your mind
and wanna help your friend,

473
00:32:26,814 --> 00:32:28,215
here's my card.

474
00:32:28,248 --> 00:32:38,158
(♪♪♪)

475
00:32:47,234 --> 00:32:49,303
Did you guys find anything else?

476
00:32:49,336 --> 00:32:51,773
OFFICER THOMPSON: <i>Isaac,
the gym where he trains at,</i>

477
00:32:51,806 --> 00:32:53,240
I think you and your boys
in Vice know him

478
00:32:53,273 --> 00:32:54,308
pretty fuckin' well.

479
00:32:54,341 --> 00:32:56,276
The fuckin' steroids
are runnin' the whole show.

480
00:32:56,310 --> 00:32:57,144
A couple of days ago,

481
00:32:57,177 --> 00:32:59,146
a few guys got popped
on a coke bust

482
00:32:59,179 --> 00:33:01,114
holdin' a decent stash
of juice.

483
00:33:01,148 --> 00:33:03,751
High-quality shit that Oscar
and his goons push.

484
00:33:03,785 --> 00:33:05,185
OFFICER THOMPSON:
Juice heads.

485
00:33:05,218 --> 00:33:06,688
Cyclists.

486
00:33:06,721 --> 00:33:08,823
This shit
could be international.

487
00:33:08,856 --> 00:33:11,191
<i>Oscar fucks up, we got him.</i>

488
00:33:14,394 --> 00:33:17,097
(Vehicles whooshing in distance)

489
00:33:19,232 --> 00:33:22,770
VOICE:
You killed them.

490
00:33:22,804 --> 00:33:25,773
(Echoing)
You killed them.

491
00:33:25,807 --> 00:33:27,709
You killed them.

492
00:33:29,343 --> 00:33:31,813
Rick Van Pelt is dead.

493
00:33:31,846 --> 00:33:32,880
(Screeching)

494
00:33:32,914 --> 00:33:35,817
(Indistinct speech)

495
00:33:37,584 --> 00:33:40,520
(Whirring)

496
00:34:04,846 --> 00:34:06,781
(Flicking)

497
00:34:11,585 --> 00:34:13,520
(Clinks)

498
00:34:31,673 --> 00:34:35,542
CONRAD: You know,
I've owned this piece for 23 years.

499
00:34:35,575 --> 00:34:39,513
It... it's been
in my gallery for 17

500
00:34:39,546 --> 00:34:42,650
and nobody paid it
a second thought

501
00:34:42,684 --> 00:34:46,553
until the artist disappeared.

502
00:34:46,586 --> 00:34:50,290
And then all of a sudden,
it spiked.

503
00:34:50,323 --> 00:34:55,429
It's become my most s...
sought-after piece.

504
00:34:55,462 --> 00:34:59,767
Now why would anybody
think that way?

505
00:34:59,801 --> 00:35:04,772
Why would anybody get enjoyment
out of such images of pain?

506
00:35:04,806 --> 00:35:06,506
Hmm.

507
00:35:06,540 --> 00:35:08,009
Detective Morrison.

508
00:35:08,042 --> 00:35:11,445
Homicide.

509
00:35:11,478 --> 00:35:13,547
Oh.

510
00:35:13,580 --> 00:35:15,016
I thought you were an educator

511
00:35:15,049 --> 00:35:18,686
the way you were
admiring my work.

512
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:20,454
I... I know
it's a little pretentious

513
00:35:20,487 --> 00:35:23,758
to have a...
a gallery where you...

514
00:35:23,791 --> 00:35:26,627
As much as I'd love to discuss
uh, all of this,

515
00:35:26,661 --> 00:35:27,862
I need to ask you
a couple of questions

516
00:35:27,895 --> 00:35:30,665
about your employee
Valerie Renard.

517
00:35:32,633 --> 00:35:34,669
Ask away.

518
00:35:34,702 --> 00:35:36,303
Well, I imagine you were one
of the last people

519
00:35:36,336 --> 00:35:37,471
to see her alive.

520
00:35:39,607 --> 00:35:41,374
She was shot in the throat
earlier this evening.

521
00:35:43,577 --> 00:35:44,846
Oh.

522
00:35:44,879 --> 00:35:47,581
Uh, no, I um...

523
00:35:48,950 --> 00:35:51,886
She... she... she... she...
she was my assistant um,

524
00:35:51,919 --> 00:35:55,455
but... but... she... she...

525
00:35:55,489 --> 00:35:58,492
Oh, she was a real close friend.

526
00:36:01,896 --> 00:36:02,830
Sir...

527
00:36:04,832 --> 00:36:06,667
did she have any reason
to steal from you?

528
00:36:08,803 --> 00:36:09,937
Was she supposed to be
in possession

529
00:36:09,971 --> 00:36:12,673
of one
of your establishment's pieces?

530
00:36:13,808 --> 00:36:15,442
No.

531
00:36:15,475 --> 00:36:17,812
B... but if you talk to Valerie,
I'm s...

532
00:36:17,845 --> 00:36:20,782
Sir, she's dead.

533
00:36:20,815 --> 00:36:22,750
I... oh.

534
00:36:22,784 --> 00:36:28,588
I... if you could ask her,
she'd have an explanation.

535
00:36:28,623 --> 00:36:30,024

716
00:52:23,477 --> 00:52:24,946
Let's talk.

717
00:52:27,380 --> 00:52:29,717
Um...

718
00:52:29,751 --> 00:52:32,820
This uh, idea of yours...

719
00:52:35,322 --> 00:52:37,457
- Mmhmm.
- Yeah.

720
00:52:42,997 --> 00:52:44,799
What if...

721
00:52:47,501 --> 00:52:48,970
...we just left?

722
00:52:52,607 --> 00:52:53,608
(Chuckles)

723
00:52:53,641 --> 00:52:54,742
Left?

724
00:52:56,010 --> 00:52:57,511
(Chuckles)
Left?

725
00:52:57,544 --> 00:52:59,546
In a couple of weeks,

726
00:52:59,579 --> 00:53:04,852
I'll have an off-the-market
Conrad Wilhelm and...

727
00:53:09,991 --> 00:53:12,292
I'm gonna have Oscar's money.

728
00:53:16,496 --> 00:53:17,531
So...

729
00:53:21,002 --> 00:53:22,335
what if...

730
00:53:24,504 --> 00:53:25,973
(Whistles)

731
00:53:27,708 --> 00:53:29,677
So... (Chuckles)

732
00:53:29,710 --> 00:53:30,477
So just... what?

733
00:53:30,510 --> 00:53:32,412
Like fuck the deal?

734
00:53:32,445 --> 00:53:34,381
Yeah.

735
00:53:34,414 --> 00:53:37,985
Fuck them and fuck Rick.

736
00:53:39,954 --> 00:53:45,026
Well, Val, I'm the team captain,
I can't just like disappear.

737
00:53:47,128 --> 00:53:49,697
Sorry to tell you this, Isaac,
but he's cutting you.

738
00:53:54,135 --> 00:53:56,871
That was one fuckin' race!

739
00:53:56,904 --> 00:53:58,438
We came in third!

740
00:53:58,471 --> 00:53:59,539
We were still on the podium.

741
00:53:59,573 --> 00:54:00,808
(Sighs)

742
00:54:03,611 --> 00:54:06,781
Rick wants to win at all costs.

743
00:54:06,814 --> 00:54:07,915
And he's taking it out
on you now,

744
00:54:07,949 --> 00:54:10,450
and he's been taking it out
on me since the injury.

745
00:54:10,483 --> 00:54:14,121
This is the way out,

746
00:54:16,489 --> 00:54:17,291
for both of us.

747
00:54:17,325 --> 00:54:19,459
I need a moment
to think about it.

748
00:54:19,492 --> 00:54:21,428
That's a lot to take in.

749
00:54:30,470 --> 00:54:32,707
(Sighs)

750
00:54:32,740 --> 00:54:34,642
You're fucking crazy.

751
00:54:34,675 --> 00:54:36,077
Yeah, hmm.

752
00:54:45,152 --> 00:54:46,888
OSCAR:
Fuck you.

753
00:54:49,156 --> 00:54:51,558
I've been workin'.

754
00:54:51,591 --> 00:54:54,427
My boys got a lead.

755
00:54:54,461 --> 00:54:58,565
They're over there right now
shaking 'em down,

756
00:54:58,598 --> 00:55:00,001
but he ain't talkin'.

757
00:55:00,034 --> 00:55:02,036
No, no, no, no.

758
00:55:02,069 --> 00:55:07,141
Forgive me if I have my doubts
about you and your associates,

759
00:55:07,174 --> 00:55:10,945
but I have gone past
being patient.

760
00:55:10,978 --> 00:55:12,680
My guys are gonna do
what they do.

761
00:55:12,713 --> 00:55:15,149
Roid rage is not going
to solve our problem.

762
00:55:15,182 --> 00:55:16,516
Better watch your mouth,
old man.

763
00:55:16,549 --> 00:55:19,787
Roid rage is for fools!

764
00:55:19,820 --> 00:55:20,988
Don't fuck with us!

765
00:55:21,022 --> 00:55:22,757
For fools!

766
00:55:22,790 --> 00:55:24,125
You're gonna end up drawing
more attention

767
00:55:24,158 --> 00:55:26,593
to everyone involved!

768
00:55:26,627 --> 00:55:29,562

778

You know, I've got ADHD.

JIMMY:
I... I swear to God,

780
00:57:28,382 --> 00:57:30,718
I don't fucking know
where he is.

781
00:57:30,751 --> 00:57:32,585
I can't give any other answer
than the truth.

782
00:57:32,620 --> 00:57:34,587
Don't make me ask you again,
motherfucker.

784
00:58:01,282 --> 00:58:02,817
What do you want?

785
00:58:05,686 --> 00:58:08,255
I swear on my fucking life
I do not know where Rick is,

786
00:58:08,289 --> 00:58:10,724
and I do not know who they are,
nor who you are,

787
00:58:10,758 --> 00:58:12,693
nor who sent you, nor why.

788
00:58:14,095 --> 00:58:16,697
Just please know I had nothing
the fuck to do with this.

789
00:58:38,219 --> 00:58:40,221
You can...
you can set that anywhere.

790
00:58:40,254 --> 00:58:42,656
You can...

00:58:42,690 --> 00:58:43,891

792
00:58:48,863 --> 00:58:53,234
Uh, please don't harm me.

793
00:58:53,267 --> 00:58:55,102
I'm a medical professional.

794
00:58:55,136 --> 00:58:57,938
I'm just a common...
just a... I'm a doctor.

808
00:59:33,874 --> 00:59:37,411
It's the freakiest shit
I've ever fuckin' seen.

I... I don't know.</i>

A few miles off the interstate
just west of town.

816

Listen to me, you come out here
when you get this,

817
00:59:59,433 --> 01:00:03,070
and I'll... I'll let you know

I don't know, I fuckin' lost it.

820

I'll find you.

821
01:00:08,809 --> 01:00:10,945
Just get out here.

822
01:00:10,978 --> 01:00:12,379
<i>Hopefully, I'll see you soon.</i>

823
01:00:12,413 --> 01:00:14,481
<i>I don't know.
Just... look, be careful.</i>

<i>I don't fuckin' know.</i>

825
01:00:16,917 --> 01:00:18,085

Hey, boss,

Scary fucker.

879
01:04:24,531 --> 01:04:26,400
You should have Rick call me,
we should meet,

'cause right now,
I'm the only one on his side.

881
01:04:28,268 --> 01:04:30,705

the only thing chasin' his tail.

where Rick might be.

We shouldn't go alone, though.

Why is that?

If we have company, so be it.

895
01:04:54,127 --> 01:04:55,630
It's a really shitty motel.

896
01:04:57,531 --> 01:05:00,067
(Indistinct radio chatter
in background)

897
01:05:02,637 --> 01:05:04,071
Did he just take the witness?

898
01:05:04,104 --> 01:05:05,272

899
01:05:05,305 --> 01:05:07,407

902
01:05:20,554 --> 01:05:21,488
What?

903
01:05:24,091 --> 01:05:25,125
Nothin'.

904
01:05:25,526 --> 01:05:26,593
No one can have that look
on their face

905
01:05:26,628 --> 01:05:27,695
and not be thinkin' nothin'.

906
01:05:29,129 --> 01:05:30,597
I'm just thinkin'
about all the possibilities.

907
01:05:32,399 --> 01:05:34,669
What possibilities?

908
01:05:36,704 --> 01:05:38,305
How Rick got himself
into all this shit.

909
01:05:39,540 --> 01:05:40,775
I mean
I'm a psychologist and all,

910
01:05:40,808 --> 01:05:42,576
but some people are just fucked.

911
01:05:42,610 --> 01:05:52,519

915
01:06:20,247 --> 01:06:23,417
Hey, boss, I uh,
I got a favor to ask.

916
01:06:24,351 --> 01:06:25,753
NIGHT CLERK: Sure, friend,
what can I do for you?

917
01:06:29,791 --> 01:06:36,363
I'm in... I'm in kinda
unique sort of trouble.

918
01:06:36,396 --> 01:06:38,633
I mean I'm...
I'm goin' out on a limb

919
01:06:38,666 --> 01:06:40,367
even asking you.

920
01:06:40,400 --> 01:06:45,405
But all my friends, I...
I thought I could count on...

921
01:06:45,439 --> 01:06:46,506
(Scoffs)

922
01:06:46,540 --> 01:06:50,544
Well, they just left me fuckin'
high and dry, man.

923
01:06:52,412 --> 01:06:53,480
My experience?

924
01:06:54,849 --> 01:06:57,619
Friends are hard to come by
this time of the night,

925
01:06:57,652 --> 01:06:59,721
especially out here
in the middle of nowhere.

926
01:07:03,557 --> 01:07:07,594
So um, what is it you need?

927
01:07:08,562 --> 01:07:09,697
(Chuckles)

928
01:07:09,731 --> 01:07:11,331
I'm happy you asked.

929
01:07:12,834 --> 01:07:17,170
Do you uh, wanna be friends?

930
01:07:17,204 --> 01:07:18,138
(Scoffs)

931
01:07:20,240 --> 01:07:21,876
If anybody comes here

932
01:07:23,410 --> 01:07:27,882
asking, looking,
anything for Rick Van Pelt,

933
01:07:28,415 --> 01:07:29,751
you don't know nothin'.

934
01:07:30,918 --> 01:07:31,853
And you call my room.

935
01:07:32,820 --> 01:07:35,255
Oh, it's easy enough.

936
01:07:35,857 --> 01:07:36,858
Happy to help.

937
01:07:37,324 --> 01:07:38,425
RICK:
Great.

938
01:07:39,994 --> 01:07:43,330
NIGHT CLERK: Oh, hey,
I can't lie to the cops

939
01:07:43,931 --> 01:07:45,399
if they come sniffin' around.

940
01:07:47,602 --> 01:07:50,237
Hey, not worried about the cops.

941
01:07:50,270 --> 01:07:51,405
NIGHT CLERK:
Oh.

942
01:07:51,438 --> 01:07:52,740
Oh, okay.

943
01:07:53,041 --> 01:07:54,508
You take care now.

944
01:07:56,243 --> 01:07:57,411

945
01:07:59,312 --> 01:08:00,915

946
01:08:02,482 --> 01:08:04,551
Yeah!
(Laughs)

947
01:08:04,584 --> 01:08:06,954
That's right,
you solve that puzzle.

948
01:08:06,988 --> 01:08:09,222
Oh, shit.

949
01:08:09,256 --> 01:08:11,458
Abracadabra,
that's a hell of a board.

950
01:08:11,926 --> 01:08:13,393
(Indistinct speech)

951
01:08:13,795 --> 01:08:14,729
Uh.

952
01:08:16,030 --> 01:08:16,964
Uh.

953
01:08:21,602 --> 01:08:24,471

956
01:09:00,908 --> 01:09:02,509
RICK:
Morning, Val.

957
01:09:02,542 --> 01:09:04,645
Or uh,
should I say "late night"?

958
01:09:04,679 --> 01:09:05,780
Funny.

959
01:09:05,813 --> 01:09:06,714
(Scoffs)

960
01:09:07,581 --> 01:09:08,515
No.

961
01:09:09,349 --> 01:09:10,450
Not really.

962
01:09:11,485 --> 01:09:13,320
(Slurps, gulps)

963
01:09:13,353 --> 01:09:18,826
Um, I'm serious, where...
where were you last night?

964
01:09:18,860 --> 01:09:20,962
I mean I...
I tried to find you all night.

965
01:09:22,830 --> 01:09:24,766
Conrad had a group of investors
at the museum.

966
01:09:24,799 --> 01:09:26,333
I had to work late.

967
01:09:30,004 --> 01:09:30,938
Really?

968
01:09:32,640 --> 01:09:34,642
Because I sent Jimmy
to the gallery

969
01:09:34,675 --> 01:09:36,309
and all the lights were off.

970
01:09:40,782 --> 01:09:43,818
Wow, fucking psycho.

971
01:09:45,953 --> 01:09:47,587
We went out afterwards.

972
01:09:50,357 --> 01:09:51,391
Why don't you trust me?

973
01:09:55,562 --> 01:09:57,832
RICK:
You just fuckin' lie to me

974
01:09:59,599 --> 01:10:01,936
and this has been goin' on
for a while, hasn't it?

975
01:10:04,672 --> 01:10:06,941
(Birds chirping in background)

976
01:10:07,942 --> 01:10:09,409
You're holed up at this house

977
01:10:09,442 --> 01:10:11,612
and it's making you
fucking paranoid.

978
01:10:12,680 --> 01:10:14,982

Hey, hey, hey, man.

981
01:10:38,873 --> 01:10:40,641
You lookin' for the party, man?

982
01:10:40,675 --> 01:10:43,376
You lookin' for the party,
I got everything you want, bro.

983
01:10:43,410 --> 01:10:44,411
RICK:
Uh, I'm good.

984
01:10:44,444 --> 01:10:45,545
Where you goin'?

985
01:10:45,579 --> 01:10:47,114
Where you goin'?

986
01:10:47,148 --> 01:10:49,951
Fuckin'

993
01:11:08,703 --> 01:11:10,437
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, man!

994
01:11:10,470 --> 01:11:12,940
You in my neighborhood,
I'm tryin' to talk to you!

995
01:11:12,974 --> 01:11:14,642
I asked if you're lookin'
for the party, man.

996
01:11:14,675 --> 01:11:15,676
I don't want a party, okay?

997
01:11:15,710 --> 01:11:16,978
Come on, hey, hey,
you ain't got to be scared,

998
01:11:17,011 --> 01:11:18,545
you ain't got to be scared!

999
01:11:18,578 --> 01:11:19,947

1001

I just want some change.
I just want some fuckin' change.

RICK:
Okay, okay.

1003
01:11:26,654 --> 01:11:27,889
Look, look, we...
we can work this out.

1004
01:11:27,922 --> 01:11:29,790
I'm gonna...
I'm gonna grab my wallet.

1005
01:11:29,824 --> 01:11:31,092
I'm gonna give you
everything I have, okay?

1006
01:11:31,125 --> 01:11:33,027
- What you got?
- We can work this out, okay?

1007
01:11:33,060 --> 01:11:34,695
- Let's work it out.
- Okay.

1008
01:11:34,729 --> 01:11:37,765
Don't fuckin'... don't you
fuckin' fuck with me now.

1009
01:11:37,798 --> 01:11:39,734
What you got there?
Let me see it.

1010

If it's safe and I need you,
I'll call you.

1020
01:13:00,982 --> 01:13:02,116
Jesus, Rick.

1021
01:13:02,850 --> 01:13:03,818
You got that?

1022
01:13:08,289 --> 01:13:10,691

Lookin' for a guy,

1029
01:13:59,673 --> 01:14:01,208
would have checked in
the last 24 hours.

1030

He knows
where this all leads, Rick.

1053
01:16:35,863 --> 01:16:37,198
He knows.

1054
01:16:37,231 --> 01:16:39,066

if you wanna get out
of here alive.

1062
01:17:55,976 --> 01:17:58,178
10 years now,
Wilhelm's phantom killer

1063
01:17:58,212 --> 01:18:00,047
has been knockin' off
every high-profile witness,

gangster, you name it,
but he doesn't exist.

to catch this fucker alive.

01:18:19,033 --> 01:18:21,035
We need to fuckin' move, now.

1074
01:18:25,272 --> 01:18:26,173
(Gun cocks)

1075
01:18:28,475 --> 01:18:29,877
(Grunts)

1076
01:18:29,910 --> 01:18:33,447
Fuck, can't... can't you just
call for backup?

1077
01:18:33,480 --> 01:18:35,582
No, man,
because he's a fuckin' ghost.

1078
01:18:35,617 --> 01:18:37,951
If he gets spooked,
poof, he's gone.

1079
01:18:37,985 --> 01:18:39,553
And then guess
who this all gets pinned on?

1080
01:18:41,188 --> 01:18:42,856
What the fuck?

1081
01:18:42,890 --> 01:18:45,359
Are you... I mean what's your...
what's your plan?

1082
01:18:45,392 --> 01:18:47,361
Why are we still hiding?
You're a fuckin' cop!

1083
01:18:47,394 --> 01:18:50,064
I don't exactly do things
by the book.

1084
01:18:50,097 --> 01:18:51,865
RICK:
What is that supposed to mean?

1085
01:18:51,899 --> 01:18:53,300
- It means you're the bait.
- RICK: No.

1086
01:18:53,334 --> 01:18:54,301
- Yeah.
- RICK: No, no, no, no, no.

1087
01:18:54,335 --> 01:18:56,638
You know, he's been chasing me
all... all day.

1088
01:18:56,671 --> 01:18:58,572
Uh, my knee I c... I can't...

1089
01:18:58,606 --> 01:19:00,274
Exactly, you're leaking.

1090
01:19:01,508 --> 01:19:03,877
He'll go exactly
where we need him to, alright?

1091
01:19:03,911 --> 01:19:05,479
Now, there's a concrete plant
just north of here.

1092
01:19:05,512 --> 01:19:06,947
I want you to go there
and meet me.

1093
01:19:08,282 --> 01:19:10,284
RICK: (Scoffs)
You're fuckin' insane.

1094
01:19:10,317 --> 01:19:12,152
Do you want to fuckin' die?

1095
01:19:12,186 --> 01:19:13,655
Go.

Bravo.

1115

You tightened up
another loose end.

1116
01:24:02,209 --> 01:24:03,778
Too bad about Oscar.

1117
01:24:05,880 --> 01:24:07,682
Oscar was an idiot.

1118
01:24:09,751 --> 01:24:10,685
You.

1119
01:24:13,453 --> 01:24:17,925
You have been
my greatest investment.

1120
01:24:19,559 --> 01:24:21,829
My greatest achievement.

1121
01:24:24,899 --> 01:24:26,668
The sun will be up
in a few minutes.

1122
01:24:27,902 --> 01:24:28,836
End it.

1123
01:24:31,271 --> 01:24:32,205
End it.

1124
01:24:32,974 --> 01:24:34,441

I hope they didn't put up
too much of a fight.

1138
01:27:57,812 --> 01:28:02,149
You know,
things got unnecessarily messy.

1139
01:28:03,618 --> 01:28:04,551
Ugly.

1140
01:28:05,518 --> 01:28:07,788

I hope with all the commotion,
it didn't lose any value.

1143
01:28:22,535 --> 01:28:24,605
I certainly will be able

H... how much for the car?

1153
01:30:22,957 --> 01:30:27,161
Well, it was um...
it's 150 for the tire,

1154
01:30:27,194 --> 01:30:30,664
