1
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:22,400
Well, we definitely got him.

2
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:26,920
It's a gut shot, but we got him pretty good.

3
00:03:27,020 --> 00:03:29,220
He didn't even take his rifle.

4
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:31,250
His horse run off, though.

5
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:33,520
Cleared up some.
We ought to get a move on.

6
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:34,960
Let him bleed.

7
00:03:36,130 --> 00:03:42,270
If he keeps going down,
he's going to get some distance on us.

8
00:03:43,630 --> 00:03:45,850
He ain't going nowhere.

9
00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:50,600
We let him bleed.

10
00:08:30,790 --> 00:08:34,590
Well, let's just get paid up
and be done with it.

11
00:08:34,690 --> 00:08:36,670
- He went in.
- Yep.

12
00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:43,100
There's no tracks on the other side.
He done gone over them falls.

13
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,620
Ain't no body.

14
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:47,700
Well, he went in that there water...

15
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:50,470
There ain't no body.
There ain't gonna be no body.

16
00:08:50,570 --> 00:08:55,010
- There's always a body.
- You expect us just to conjure him?

17
00:08:55,110 --> 00:09:00,850
I expect you to find him.
That's what I'm paying you for.

18
00:10:29,510 --> 00:10:30,610
Stay, stay.

19
00:10:34,010 --> 00:10:35,110
Stay.

20
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:41,200
Oh, God.

21
00:13:16,710 --> 00:13:18,370
Oh, God. Oh, God.

22
00:13:36,130 --> 00:13:37,790
Y'all smell that?

23
00:14:42,230 --> 00:14:43,330
Oh, fuck.

24
00:16:15,490 --> 00:16:16,990
Don't touch it.

25
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:34,970
He's doubled back on his tracks.
Hayes, you and the kid follow those two.

26
00:16:35,070 --> 00:16:37,010
Pope, you take that one.

27
00:16:37,110 --> 00:16:39,380
Mr. Parsons, you wait here.

28
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:42,280
I'll take this one. He's not far.

29
00:16:42,380 --> 00:16:44,850
So watch yourselves. I got his gun.

30
00:16:44,950 --> 00:16:47,490
He ain't bleeding no more.

31
00:16:49,350 --> 00:16:50,450
Yes, he is.

32
00:20:30,140 --> 00:20:31,400
Where's Pope?

33
00:20:33,510 --> 00:20:37,280
The intervals are 10 feet.
Be ready. He's here.

34
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:41,580
Remember, if you kill this son of a bitch,
you will not be paid.

35
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:43,180
Extremities only.

36
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:23,500
God damn it. Oh, hell.

37
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:27,920
Lord almighty.

38
00:21:29,730 --> 00:21:32,030
What did he do to Pope?

39
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:36,120
Mister, who the hell is this man?

40
00:21:36,310 --> 00:21:39,410
Get the horses. We have him now.

41
00:21:40,740 --> 00:21:43,760
He must be part Indian or wolf.

42
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:49,580
- Eat a man like that.
- He didn't eat him. Go.

43
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:13,400
Go.

44
00:23:17,710 --> 00:23:22,490
Just what in the hell
do you think you're doing?

45
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:36,180
I guess it makes sense.

46
00:23:39,060 --> 00:23:42,460
- Finished off by a young'un.
- I ain't no young'un.

47
00:23:42,570 --> 00:23:46,230
And I don't care to hear you say
another goddamn thing.

48
00:23:46,340 --> 00:23:52,800
Now, come on out of there
and put your hands out in front of you.

49
00:23:57,250 --> 00:23:58,350
Come on.

50
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:09,260
You been shot.

51
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:12,890
Trying to steal somebody else's horse,
I reckon.

52
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:17,380
I'd say you need a new line of work, mister.

53
00:24:28,110 --> 00:24:29,210
Nathaniel!

54
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:32,420
Nathaniel! Come on.

55
00:24:38,750 --> 00:24:40,010
Come on, now.

56
00:25:01,810 --> 00:25:04,830
Thank you, thank you. Thank you.

57
00:25:08,620 --> 00:25:11,240
- Who is he?
- Horse thief.

58
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:13,740
But he's hurt.

59
00:25:14,790 --> 00:25:16,830
I'll pay for the horse.

60
00:25:16,930 --> 00:25:19,070
You best rest yourself.

61
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:26,120
Pa'll be home after a while,
and he'll decide what to do with you.

62
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:37,580
No more tracks, Carver.

63
00:25:38,210 --> 00:25:41,230
The trail's gone cold up there.

64
00:26:18,390 --> 00:26:19,650
Your sister...

65
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:26,020
She don't take kindly to thieving.

66
00:26:29,330 --> 00:26:34,190
There's plenty of time for that
when you grow up.

67
00:26:38,170 --> 00:26:39,270
See that.

68
00:26:44,110 --> 00:26:45,810
Yeah, he's still bleeding.

69
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:49,020
There's something else down here.

70
00:26:49,620 --> 00:26:51,760
- Take a look.
- Yeah.

71
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:58,260
What'd you see?

72
00:27:03,970 --> 00:27:05,070
Charlotte.

73
00:27:11,710 --> 00:27:13,740
We caught him trying to steal Red.

74
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:15,420
He's hurt. Shot.

75
00:27:17,810 --> 00:27:19,710
Who are you, mister?

76
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:24,300
I do some trapping a bit north of here.

77
00:27:24,950 --> 00:27:28,290
Must be quite a bit north of here.

78
00:27:29,990 --> 00:27:31,170
Quite a bit.

79
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:36,380
I don't expect you shot yourself.

80
00:27:37,970 --> 00:27:39,070
No. No.

81
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,380
Somebody after your hides?

82
00:27:44,740 --> 00:27:47,200
Fringing on your territory?

83
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:49,540
I couldn't say.

84
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:55,300
You come down out of that pass
without a horse?

85
00:27:56,020 --> 00:28:01,440
Up here, a man without a horse
is generally a dead man.

86
00:28:03,330 --> 00:28:04,890
That I can solve.

87
00:28:04,990 --> 00:28:08,830
So I don't take kindly to a man
trying to steal mine.

88
00:28:08,930 --> 00:28:13,470
Like I told your girl, I'll pay for the horse.

89
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:22,010
It's only about six days' walk
from here to town,

90
00:28:22,110 --> 00:28:23,290
as I recall.

91
00:28:24,610 --> 00:28:28,670
I'll pay you twice what you paid for her.

92
00:28:29,050 --> 00:28:30,550
If you can pay,

93
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:35,820
why don't you just walk yourself
down there?

94
00:29:02,890 --> 00:29:04,390
I'd rather not.

95
00:29:13,330 --> 00:29:16,990
- Nothing there.
- Not a goddamn thing.

96
00:29:17,670 --> 00:29:20,370
- I'll go down there and take a look.
- No.

97
00:29:20,470 --> 00:29:23,610
We're done here. We'll follow the ridge.

98
00:29:23,710 --> 00:29:27,690
That's 16 days. Seventeen out Mount Olive,

99
00:29:28,510 --> 00:29:31,050
- at $1 a day.
- You'll get your money when we find him.

100
00:29:31,150 --> 00:29:32,250
Not before.

101
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:35,620
What do you mean? You saw.

102
00:29:36,450 --> 00:29:38,590
That trail ends down
at the end of that ravine.

103
00:29:38,690 --> 00:29:41,160
'Cause he never went down the ravine.

104
00:29:41,260 --> 00:29:43,160
We follow the ridge.

105
00:30:19,460 --> 00:30:20,560
Come here.

106
00:30:32,910 --> 00:30:34,010
I'm Gideon.

107
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:51,620
You don't talk much, do you, boy?

108
00:30:52,630 --> 00:30:56,050
You know, it's not considered polite

109
00:30:58,770 --> 00:31:03,150
to shoot a man
who's sleeping in your house.

110
00:31:36,370 --> 00:31:37,470
Well,

111
00:31:39,170 --> 00:31:41,070
get on back to bed.

112
00:32:42,140 --> 00:32:43,320
Where is he?

113
00:32:44,110 --> 00:32:46,740
- Who the hell...
- I'm doing the asking here.

114
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:49,840
- Coffee and biscuits, woman.
- Now, lie to me

115
00:32:49,950 --> 00:32:52,880
and I will fire this place with you
and yourn in it.

116
00:32:52,980 --> 00:32:55,750
- Now where is he?
- Must have left at first light.

117
00:32:55,850 --> 00:32:58,620
We done got here at first light. Damn fool.

118
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:02,560
- Were he able-bodied when he come here?
- No.

119
00:33:02,660 --> 00:33:05,430
- Did you give him supplies or a rifle?
- No.

120
00:33:05,530 --> 00:33:09,930
- He had a pistol.
- Took that off of Pope after he killed him.

121
00:33:10,030 --> 00:33:12,890
- You give him a horse?
- No.

122
00:33:13,270 --> 00:33:15,540
Ain't no horse for that one.

123
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:18,570
Mister, I don't know where you come from,

124
00:33:18,670 --> 00:33:21,610
but we helped a shot mongrel of a man,
and he's gone away in the night,

125
00:33:21,710 --> 00:33:24,010
and that's all we know.

126
00:33:29,220 --> 00:33:31,680
You lying son of a bitch.

127
00:33:32,690 --> 00:33:38,590
What did you sell him?
What did the devil get for his money?

128
00:33:45,770 --> 00:33:46,870
Hayes.

129
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:52,100
I ain't paying you to play with womenfolk.

130
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:25,300
Tell me about the man who came here.

131
00:34:27,380 --> 00:34:29,760
If I think you're lying,

132
00:34:30,150 --> 00:34:35,490
I'll kill your brother
and hand you over to Mr. Hayes.

133
00:34:36,290 --> 00:34:37,470
He was here,

134
00:34:39,620 --> 00:34:42,080
and he left in the night.

135
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:46,790
- Stole a mare, looks like.
- What about that gold?

136
00:34:46,900 --> 00:34:48,240
I don't know.

137
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:50,540
I don't know.

138
00:34:55,670 --> 00:34:56,770
I took it.

139
00:34:58,310 --> 00:35:02,210
He was sleeping. I took it from his bag.

140
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:05,180
I only wanted a gun

141
00:35:05,910 --> 00:35:07,250
to protect us.

142
00:35:16,090 --> 00:35:20,390
Son, nobody can protect nobody
in this world.

143
00:35:21,630 --> 00:35:25,370
The sooner you realize that, the better.

144
00:35:49,990 --> 00:35:51,810
Pope's horse stays.

145
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:50,820
You son of a bitch.

146
00:36:52,860 --> 00:36:55,800
No wonder you don't talk much.

147
00:36:56,120 --> 00:36:57,780
Too busy thieving.

148
00:40:32,170 --> 00:40:34,440
How do you write "wife"?

149
00:40:34,540 --> 00:40:36,120
Kid, that's W...

150
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:39,580
H-O-R-E.

151
00:40:43,220 --> 00:40:46,120
Don't much matter how you spell it,

152
00:40:46,220 --> 00:40:50,790
a woman ain't gonna be yours
unless you're paying her for the night.

153
00:40:50,890 --> 00:40:53,890
You pay her to be sweet to you, kid,
that's all.

154
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:57,340
Don't never mix up money and love.

155
00:41:14,050 --> 00:41:15,550
Toss the pistol.

156
00:41:28,700 --> 00:41:30,360
What do you want?

157
00:41:31,270 --> 00:41:37,970
I'd have thought that it was obvious,
seeing as how I've been shooting at you.

158
00:41:38,070 --> 00:41:39,970
Keep them hands out.

159
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:44,980
Turn around.

160
00:41:51,990 --> 00:41:54,210
Why are you doing this?

161
00:41:57,560 --> 00:41:58,900
Seraphim Falls.

162
00:42:08,940 --> 00:42:10,280
Colonel Carver.

163
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:17,980
Turn around. I wanna see your face.

164
00:42:41,870 --> 00:42:46,330
- What?
- Double watches the rest of the night.

165
00:44:04,420 --> 00:44:07,690
You'll be on him before long.
He was here today.

166
00:44:07,790 --> 00:44:13,370
Watch the sides.
Make sure he didn't break off and cover.

167
00:45:09,980 --> 00:45:11,160
Jesus Christ.

168
00:45:15,720 --> 00:45:21,140
He's still breathing.
We got to get this thing off him.

169
00:45:29,970 --> 00:45:32,750
Parsons, see about that horse.

170
00:46:10,080 --> 00:46:14,350
Well, now we got some discussing to do.
Right here and now.

171
00:46:14,450 --> 00:46:17,990
We ain't negotiating based on
tracking no killer like this.

172
00:46:18,090 --> 00:46:20,310
You're being well-paid.

173
00:46:21,360 --> 00:46:24,260
We're 18 days on a 30-day commission,

174
00:46:24,360 --> 00:46:28,060
- and two of us is already dead.
- Can't say I'm surprised.

175
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:31,830
The man we're after
preys on the weak and unprepared.

176
00:46:31,930 --> 00:46:34,230
I'd advise you to take this as a warning.

177
00:46:34,340 --> 00:46:40,640
Well, what if we just decided
to take that as our walking papers?

178
00:46:41,610 --> 00:46:44,680
You are, of course,
free to do that, Mr. Hayes.

179
00:46:44,780 --> 00:46:49,480
You will, however, do it without
the assistance of my horse on which you sit.

180
00:46:49,580 --> 00:46:51,640
Am I clear, gentlemen?

181
00:46:52,220 --> 00:46:53,640
We'll keep on.

182
00:46:53,820 --> 00:46:59,160
But we want to split the pay
that's due them, instead.

183
00:46:59,860 --> 00:47:02,630
Done. Now we've got distance to cover.

184
00:47:02,730 --> 00:47:06,300
If our man makes it to the low country,
we'll likely never see him again.

185
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:10,220
Wouldn't catch me complaining about that.

186
00:48:38,290 --> 00:48:39,870
Morning, stranger.

187
00:48:42,430 --> 00:48:46,530
I didn't figure any transients this far up.

188
00:48:46,630 --> 00:48:49,000
I'm just passing through, is all.

189
00:48:49,100 --> 00:48:50,440
You need some whiskey?
We got some whiskey.

190
00:48:50,540 --> 00:48:52,040
Shut up, Horace.

191
00:48:52,540 --> 00:48:55,810
No, I can't say as I'm looking for whiskey,

192
00:48:55,910 --> 00:48:58,930
but I sure could use some food.

193
00:49:03,920 --> 00:49:08,160
Looks like you boys
have got other things on your mind.

194
00:49:08,260 --> 00:49:13,040
Would have been helpful
if you hadn't seen those.

195
00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:18,470
Well, if you ain't planning on eating,
I'll just be getting on.

196
00:49:18,570 --> 00:49:21,870
I'm afraid I can't let you do that.

197
00:49:21,970 --> 00:49:24,840
You see, we is fugitives from the law.

198
00:49:24,940 --> 00:49:27,980
They catch us, they're gonna string us up.

199
00:49:28,080 --> 00:49:30,180
Horace, if you don't get quiet,
I'm gonna hang you myself.

200
00:49:30,280 --> 00:49:32,980
It don't much matter to me.

201
00:49:33,350 --> 00:49:38,050
I'm just looking to be left alone.
Same as you.

202
00:49:40,620 --> 00:49:42,920
So, I'll be on my way.

203
00:49:45,790 --> 00:49:48,970
You look powerful familiar, mister.

204
00:49:50,060 --> 00:49:51,160
I know you?

205
00:49:55,940 --> 00:49:57,040
I doubt it.

206
00:50:05,250 --> 00:50:06,750
I'll be damned.

207
00:50:07,120 --> 00:50:09,380
That's one of McClellan's boys
up at Antietam.

208
00:50:09,480 --> 00:50:11,650
Ain't you gonna kill him, huh?

209
00:50:11,750 --> 00:50:13,420
Waste of a bullet.

210
00:50:13,520 --> 00:50:16,790
He's so banged up and hungry,
he won't make it to town anyway.

211
00:50:16,890 --> 00:50:18,630
Lost both his sons

212
00:50:19,760 --> 00:50:23,000
in one day at that goddamn bridge.

213
00:50:23,100 --> 00:50:25,430
- I seen it myself.
- Yeah?

214
00:50:25,530 --> 00:50:27,750
But nothing touched him.

215
00:50:28,740 --> 00:50:30,080
Not a scratch.

216
00:50:30,810 --> 00:50:32,230
Not a splinter.

217
00:50:34,080 --> 00:50:36,380
They say he killed over 100 men
that day alone.

218
00:50:36,480 --> 00:50:37,580
Him? Nah.

219
00:50:38,910 --> 00:50:43,250
Hey, you use some of that money
to get yourself some spectacles.

220
00:50:43,350 --> 00:50:46,590
Still, Virgil, the way you shot that teller,
I thought you'd be itching to do it again.

221
00:50:46,690 --> 00:50:49,420
I'm itching to get out of here. Get going.

222
00:50:49,520 --> 00:50:51,820
Goddamn right. Let's go.

223
00:50:52,560 --> 00:50:54,030
Don't ever go chasing after that man.

224
00:50:54,130 --> 00:50:56,630
If you don't shoot him,
I swear to Christ I will.

225
00:50:56,730 --> 00:50:58,930
We can't be letting no stranger,
whoever the hell you think he is,

226
00:50:59,030 --> 00:51:01,370
just walk into town
and tell them authorities where we gone.

227
00:51:01,470 --> 00:51:06,010
- Let's go. Come on.
- Take care of it myself.

228
00:51:06,640 --> 00:51:07,740
Horace!

229
00:51:08,910 --> 00:51:10,410
Horace, come on!

230
00:51:15,980 --> 00:51:20,840
Afraid I'm gonna have to ask you
to stop walking.

231
00:51:22,590 --> 00:51:24,090
Let me be, boy.

232
00:51:26,260 --> 00:51:28,760
Best just go on back up to your kin.

233
00:51:28,860 --> 00:51:31,800
Mister, I never shot nobody
in the back before.

234
00:51:31,900 --> 00:51:34,670
So it's best you just turn around,

235
00:51:34,770 --> 00:51:38,740
- and you get what's coming to you.
- Boy,

236
00:51:38,840 --> 00:51:42,260
now you put that gun up and go on.

237
00:51:42,540 --> 00:51:43,640
Turn around.

238
00:52:13,170 --> 00:52:15,070
You're a fool, boy.

239
00:52:17,510 --> 00:52:20,450
I told you to let me pass on.

240
00:52:38,870 --> 00:52:39,970
Hey!

241
00:52:45,570 --> 00:52:47,640
There was three of 'em.

242
00:52:47,740 --> 00:52:52,360
Two of 'em went on up,
one went down that way.

243
00:53:16,640 --> 00:53:19,740
- Look familiar, gentlemen?
- Figure it's him that done it?

244
00:53:19,840 --> 00:53:20,810
'Course it's him.

245
00:53:20,910 --> 00:53:24,340
Who else would be dropping folks
like owl pellets out on these hills?

246
00:53:24,450 --> 00:53:27,380
If he's got himself another horse,
we won't catch him before sundown.

247
00:53:27,480 --> 00:53:29,420
I reckon we ought to move
down valley, then.

248
00:53:29,520 --> 00:53:32,650
He won't be heading toward Carson City.

249
00:53:32,750 --> 00:53:36,810
Come on. Let's get off these cursed hills.

250
00:53:37,490 --> 00:53:40,160
You two can go on without me.

251
00:53:40,260 --> 00:53:41,360
What?

252
00:53:42,760 --> 00:53:45,730
Those boys have been wanted
for six months.

253
00:53:45,830 --> 00:53:48,290
He's worth 250 in Carson.

254
00:53:48,600 --> 00:53:51,300
That's a damned sight better
than what he's offering.

255
00:53:51,410 --> 00:53:53,510
And this boy don't require no chasing.

256
00:53:53,610 --> 00:53:56,340
- You can't just leave.
- The hell I can't.

257
00:53:56,440 --> 00:53:58,310
You would, too,
if you knew what was good for you.

258
00:53:58,410 --> 00:54:01,410
The posse's take is all yours
when the ride's done.

259
00:54:01,520 --> 00:54:08,120
No less than 120 and you don't have to ride
with a stinking corpse, neither.

260
00:54:08,220 --> 00:54:09,320
All right.

261
00:54:15,260 --> 00:54:16,360
You sure?

262
00:54:17,530 --> 00:54:21,830
You go on and get yourself killed. I'm done.

263
00:54:27,710 --> 00:54:28,810
Okay.

264
00:54:49,500 --> 00:54:51,730
Let him earn that 250 the hard way.

265
00:54:51,830 --> 00:54:53,930
He ain't never going to make it
to town without a horse.

266
00:54:54,040 --> 00:54:57,700
I told you boys. Them horses are mine.

267
00:55:32,410 --> 00:55:36,110
We can water your mare.
She looks hard-ridden.

268
00:55:36,210 --> 00:55:41,550
Mercy to the beast is blessed
in the eyes of the Lord.

269
00:55:44,620 --> 00:55:46,280
He sees your sin.

270
00:57:06,900 --> 00:57:08,800
That's all you got.

271
00:57:32,360 --> 00:57:34,100
I don't know you.
