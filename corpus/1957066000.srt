00:37:22,939 --> 00:37:24,508
[WHISPERS] Of course, I did.

877
00:37:25,409 --> 00:37:27,445
I yelled, I screamed.

878
00:37:28,779 --> 00:37:30,514
I prayed novenas.

879
00:37:31,982 --> 00:37:34,518
I went to mass and communion.

880
00:37:35,986 --> 00:37:38,022
I said rosaries.

881
00:37:39,923 --> 00:37:43,894
I gave everything
in my power to stop it.

882
00:37:47,331 --> 00:37:48,332
Not the head, Ed.

883
00:37:51,034 --> 00:37:52,069
Not the head.

884
00:37:52,102 --> 00:37:53,470

00:37:55,839 --> 00:37:57,308
She was always
afraid of brain damage.

888
00:37:57,341 --> 00:37:58,509
She'd say,
[IMITATING] &quot;Not the head.

889
00:37:58,542 --> 00:37:59,977
&quot;Not the head.&quot;

890
00:38:00,010 --> 00:38:01,612
I mean, now I wanna
just scream at her.

891
00:38:01,645 --> 00:38:04,348
&quot;Shut up, just shut up!&quot;

You know, 'cause
that's where the blows
would come every time.

893

Every single time!

894
00:38:08,985 --> 00:38:11,822
[SCOFFS] Why didn't she say
&quot;Not the legs&quot;?

895
00:38:11,855 --> 00:38:13,691
&quot;Not the legs.&quot;

896
00:38:13,724 --> 00:38:16,727
Sharon, just what the hell
do you think you're doing?

897
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:19,063
I just got off
the phone with Dad.

898
00:38:19,096 --> 00:38:21,598
He says he's been
served papers for a lawsuit,

899
00:38:21,631 --> 00:38:23,533
for child abuse.

900
00:38:23,567 --> 00:38:25,402
He's totally destroyed.

901
00:38:25,435 --> 00:38:26,871
He wants to kill himself.

902
00:38:27,971 --> 00:38:30,074
Now, John and I
talked him out of that.

903
00:38:30,107 --> 00:38:33,110
And he's willing to get
treatment for his alcoholism.

904
00:38:33,143 --> 00:38:34,144
Oh, that's great.

<i> Look, he's willing
 to get help.</i>

906

This lawsuit won't help him.

He's an old man.

911
00:38:43,553 --> 00:38:44,988
I'm thinking about myself

00:38:45,021 --> 00:38:46,757

Why can't you just
forgive and forget?

921
00:39:01,972 --> 00:39:03,540

It's going to be
much harder for him

to lie if you're
sitting in the room.

932
00:40:02,766 --> 00:40:05,569
You were
a child abuse expert.

First, with the FBI
and later

934
00:40:07,938 --> 00:40:10,574
with the district
attorney's office.

935
00:40:10,607 --> 00:40:13,110
You've written extensively
on the subject,

936
00:40:13,143 --> 00:40:16,514
you've spoken out
publicly on behalf
of abused children.

937

Have you ever
thought of yourself
as a child abuser?

ED: I have

939
00:40:25,489 --> 00:40:27,157
thought of myself

00:40:39,002 --> 00:40:40,938
Do you recall that
when you disciplined

945
00:40:40,971 --> 00:40:42,673
one of your children,
you would line

946
00:40:42,706 --> 00:40:44,542

to watch?

947
00:40:46,543 --> 00:40:47,845
I don't recall that.

00:40:49,179 --> 00:40:51,548

forced to watch

Do you recall rupturing
Steve's eardrum?

954

No.

when you punched John

956
00:41:07,597 --> 00:41:09,600

would you recall it?

00:41:27,951 --> 00:41:30,954
If I did any injury,
I would.

00:41:30,987 --> 00:41:32,089

to your bed, climbing on top
of her and fondling her?

No.

998
00:42:56,239 --> 00:42:58,842
Why would she make this
allegation if it wasn't true?

999
00:43:00,343 --> 00:43:03,312
Loss of her
father's affection,
lack of attention,

I may not have been

That's why I went
into this field.

To learn
about child abuse?

00:43:16,660 --> 00:43:19,895
That's correct.

00:43:19,929 --> 00:43:22,333
Did you learn about it
firsthand in your own home?

1010

No.

1033
00:44:37,373 --> 00:44:39,242
It brought me
right back to my childhood

1034
00:44:39,275 --> 00:44:41,378
when I would see something

1035
00:44:41,411 --> 00:44:44,181
and have to pretend
it never happened.

1036
00:44:44,214 --> 00:44:46,950
Is that what
this poetry's about?

1037
00:44:46,983 --> 00:44:48,752
I don't know
what it's about.

1038
00:44:50,153 --> 00:44:51,988
There, why don't you
read one?

1039
00:44:54,891 --> 00:44:59,930
&quot;And he'd speak about
things I needed to know,

1040
00:44:59,963 --> 00:45:03,834
&quot;in a voice that covered me
to my chin.

1041
00:45:04,868 --> 00:45:08,205
&quot;In yards of purple velvet

1042
00:45:08,238 --> 00:45:13,210
&quot;until my whole
body tingled alive,

1043
00:45:13,243 --> 00:45:17,247
&quot;then timing
my breath to his,

1044
00:45:18,281 --> 00:45:21,351
&quot;we'd glide to that rhythm

1045
00:45:21,384 --> 00:45:24,454
&quot;in the pitch black,

1046
00:45:24,487 --> 00:45:27,858
&quot;rising and falling,

1047
00:45:27,891 --> 00:45:32,029
&quot;like lovers,
riding a carousel.&quot;

1048
00:45:34,831 --> 00:45:36,433
What does that
mean to you?

1049
00:45:42,205 --> 00:45:43,907
I don't know.

1050
00:45:43,940 --> 00:45:46,476
Who's the voice?
The voice in the dark.

1051
00:45:46,509 --> 00:45:48,512

in my head.

1741
01:23:25,566 --> 01:23:28,103
I have some body sensations.

1742
01:23:33,841 --> 01:23:36,778
I have these feelings
of suffocation.

1743
01:23:36,811 --> 01:23:38,380
Someone on top of me.

1744
01:23:42,516 --> 01:23:45,486
I've never had the courage
to say this before.

1745
01:23:47,088 --> 01:23:50,358
But, yes,
I know it happened.

1746
01:23:53,761 --> 01:23:55,397
How did it feel?

1747
01:23:59,667 --> 01:24:02,136
How did it feel to stand by

1748
01:24:02,169 --> 01:24:04,806
and watch your sisters
and brothers being beaten?

1749
01:24:06,874 --> 01:24:10,311
I honestly don't remember
feeling anything.

1750
01:24:12,179 --> 01:24:13,181
Nothing?

1751
01:24:14,548 --> 01:24:15,550
Nothing.

1752
01:24:17,518 --> 01:24:21,255
The first time I realized that
wasn't normal, I was, uh...

1753
01:24:21,288 --> 01:24:23,391
I was 16.

1754
01:24:23,424 --> 01:24:27,562
I was working as a nurse's aid
at a maternity ward.

1755
01:24:27,595 --> 01:24:30,865
On three different occasions,
infants died.

1756
01:24:30,898 --> 01:24:33,267
And all three times
I volunteered

1757
01:24:33,300 --> 01:24:35,436
to bring the babies
to the morgue.

1758
01:24:35,469 --> 01:24:36,738
Because it didn't bother me.

1759
01:24:42,743 --> 01:24:45,380

I remember being pregnant.

1765
01:25:03,397 --> 01:25:05,433
All of my friends
were having babies.

1766
01:25:06,901 --> 01:25:10,138
They kept telling me
how good it feels
to be a mother.

1767
01:25:11,772 --> 01:25:14,109
&quot;Wait until you feel that,&quot;
they said.

1768
01:25:16,243 --> 01:25:19,114
&quot;Just wait until you hold
your own baby in your arms.&quot;

1769
01:25:23,450 --> 01:25:25,253
When they handed me my baby...

1770
01:25:27,955 --> 01:25:30,325
I waited for those feelings.

1771
01:25:31,392 --> 01:25:32,594
But they didn't come.

1772
01:25:35,296 --> 01:25:37,332
I knew something
was very wrong.

1773
01:25:39,900 --> 01:25:41,568
I didn't feel anything.

1774
01:25:42,603 --> 01:25:44,205
I didn't feel love.

1775
01:25:46,707 --> 01:25:49,277
It was no different than
holding the dead babies.

1776
01:26:01,322 --> 01:26:04,225

1777
01:26:06,260 --> 01:26:07,896
&quot;Something is wrong with you.

1778
01:26:13,234 --> 01:26:14,869
&quot;You don't work right.&quot;

1779
01:26:18,272 --> 01:26:21,576
I knew I just didn't work right.

1780
01:26:26,413 --> 01:26:29,349
I remember telling myself
that children need

1781
01:26:29,383 --> 01:26:31,519
to be touched,
they need to be loved.

1782
01:26:32,353 --> 01:26:33,888
And I reminded myself.

1783
01:26:34,922 --> 01:26:37,724
I told myself every day,

1784
01:26:37,758 --> 01:26:40,494
to pick up my baby.
I didn't wait
for the feelings,

1785
01:26:40,527 --> 01:26:41,963
I just picked her up.

1786
01:26:43,697 --> 01:26:45,667
But she couldn't
have felt any love.

The abuse I suffered,
I passed on to my children.

1788
01:26:59,313 --> 01:27:02,250
And not by beating them
or molesting them.

1789
01:27:03,684 --> 01:27:06,854
But by simply bringing them
into this world,

1790
01:27:06,887 --> 01:27:08,523
and trying to be a mother.

1791
01:27:11,025 --> 01:27:13,695
I couldn't do that.

1792
01:27:14,995 --> 01:27:17,398
Because...

1793
01:27:17,431 --> 01:27:20,768
I'm not so different
from my own mother.

1794
01:27:23,771 --> 01:27:27,741
That's the most painful thing
I've ever said in my life.

1795
01:27:29,009 --> 01:27:31,546
The woman I believed
hated me.

1796
01:27:34,682 --> 01:27:36,517

1797
01:27:38,519 --> 01:27:40,488
Couldn't teach me
how to love.

1798
01:27:42,089 --> 01:27:43,992
And I couldn't teach
my children.

I know some of our damage
is permanent.

But I can feel now.

1801
01:28:03,844 --> 01:28:05,046
And if I can feel,

1802
01:28:06,847 --> 01:28:08,049
maybe I can love.

1803
01:28:10,818 --> 01:28:12,287
I can love my children.

1804
01:28:14,355 --> 01:28:15,589
I can love my husband.

1805
01:28:18,058 --> 01:28:20,328
And maybe,
even I can love myself.
