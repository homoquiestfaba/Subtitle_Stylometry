00:00:39,273 --> 00:00:40,474
[sighs]

3
00:00:40,674 --> 00:00:42,843
I've been thinking a lot,

4
00:00:42,876 --> 00:00:44,645
especially the last few months,

5
00:00:44,678 --> 00:00:46,413
about this-

6
00:00:46,446 --> 00:00:48,649
this book I read in college.

7
00:00:48,682 --> 00:00:50,884
It's this story about a boy.

8
00:00:50,918 --> 00:00:55,222
He's the reclusive son of this
disgraced noble family,

9
00:00:55,255 --> 00:00:58,458
and buys a turtle.

10
00:00:59,326 --> 00:01:02,396
But he thinks that the-
the turtle's shell is too plain,

11
00:01:02,429 --> 00:01:05,666
so he has it covered
with jewels,

12
00:01:05,699 --> 00:01:09,436
diamonds, sapphires, rubies.

13
00:01:09,469 --> 00:01:11,204
And it's- and it's beautiful,

14
00:01:11,238 --> 00:01:14,541
but the weight of
the turtle's shell is so heavy

15
00:01:14,574 --> 00:01:18,412
that it- it kills the turtle...

16
00:01:18,445 --> 00:01:22,716
crushed under the weight
of the ornamentation.

17
00:01:25,285 --> 00:01:27,321
And it's not the turtle's fault.

18
00:01:31,658 --> 00:01:32,826
Anyways...

19
00:01:34,895 --> 00:01:37,431

20
00:01:44,538 --> 00:01:46,573

with matters mathematical, ?

26

the simple and quadratical, ?

27
00:01:58,885 --> 00:02:01,555

I'm teeming with a lot of news ?

47
00:02:40,961 --> 00:02:42,796
I don't even know
why you bother, Charles.

48
00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:44,631
You haven't won

49
00:03:10,657 --> 00:03:14,861
That's the Blackworth boy

50
00:03:14,895 --> 00:03:16,830
-Well, uh--
-I thought you

and nothing but the truth,

61

00:04:28,935 --> 00:04:30,904
Never really had a boyfriend,

69
00:04:30,937 --> 00:04:36,109
but he did have a Jewish stomach
that gave him a lot of problems.

70
00:04:36,143 --> 00:04:37,677
We lost a lot
of good men to IBS.

Well, that's alright, Ursula.

00:09:00,407 --> 00:09:01,775
[laughs]

186
00:09:01,808 --> 00:09:03,276
What's going on here?

187
00:09:03,309 --> 00:09:07,046
Trying to score
some downtown pianist?

188
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:09,783
Charlie Kinberg,
is this humus even kosher?

189
00:09:10,283 --> 00:09:11,351
(Charlie)
Sebastian.

190
00:09:11,384 --> 00:09:12,752
Kosher?

191
00:09:13,353 --> 00:09:14,921
(Sebastian) Come on,
let's get outta here.

192
00:09:14,954 --> 00:09:15,655
Now?

193
00:09:15,688 --> 00:09:17,323
Yeah, I'm over it.
Let's go.

194
00:09:18,391 --> 00:09:21,227
-Um, I guess I should--
-Stay?

195
00:09:21,928 --> 00:09:23,062
And sing?

196
00:09:23,963 --> 00:09:24,464
(Sebastian)
Come on, Charlemagne.

197
00:09:24,497 --> 00:09:25,932
Your chariot awaits.

198
00:09:29,702 --> 00:09:31,037
(Charlie)
How did he know I played piano?

199
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:34,073
Name one little gay boy
that hasn't taken piano lessons.

200
00:09:34,107 --> 00:09:35,141
-Oh, come on.
-Seriously.

201
00:09:35,175 --> 00:09:36,643
He looked at my fingertips
and he said that I --

202
00:09:36,676 --> 00:09:37,644
(Reporter)
Hey, Mister Blackworth.

203
00:09:37,677 --> 00:09:40,814
What are you doin'
out tonight, huh? Huh?

204
00:09:40,847 --> 00:09:41,681
Go.

205
00:09:41,714 --> 00:09:42,882
(Wyatt) Come on, man.
Leave him alone.

206
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:43,349
(Reporter)
Whose money are
you spending, Sebastian?

207
00:09:43,383 --> 00:09:44,951
Hey, Sebastian--

208
00:09:47,086 --> 00:09:49,622
I hope your father
rots in jail forever!

209
00:09:51,458 --> 00:09:52,659
Time to go home.

210
00:09:52,692 --> 00:09:53,693
Go home.

211
00:09:54,461 --> 00:09:55,995
Come on.
Guys, Leave him alone!

212
00:09:56,029 --> 00:09:57,730
I said leave him alone.

213
00:09:57,764 --> 00:09:58,031
Stop!

214
00:09:58,064 --> 00:09:58,665
Open up!

215
00:09:58,698 --> 00:09:59,666
Hey!
Hey, Sebastian!

216
00:09:59,699 --> 00:10:02,402
You knew about the
transfers, didn't you?

217
00:10:03,169 --> 00:10:04,270
Ah--

218
00:10:09,476 --> 00:10:11,311
Hey, Sebastian. Come on.

219
00:10:16,449 --> 00:10:18,017
(Charlie)
You okay?

220
00:10:24,023 --> 00:10:25,658
Never again.

221
00:10:34,467 --> 00:10:36,936
[horn blowing]

222
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:41,441
(Rabbi)
These are our high holy days.

223
00:10:41,474 --> 00:10:44,444
It is at this time of year that
we reflect on all that has been

224
00:10:44,477 --> 00:10:47,981
and think of that which
we can do in the new year.

225
00:10:48,014 --> 00:10:49,449
Please be seated.

226
00:10:51,317 --> 00:10:52,852
[cell phone vibrating]

227
00:10:54,087 --> 00:10:56,189
[whispers] Who's calling you
during Rosh Hashanah services?

228
00:10:56,222 --> 00:10:57,323
Remember your love for us,

229
00:10:57,357 --> 00:10:59,325
the covenant you made with
Abraham on Mount Moriah.

230
00:10:59,359 --> 00:11:00,360
[whispers] Sebastian.

231
00:11:00,393 --> 00:11:02,795
Oh, poor thing.

232
00:11:02,829 --> 00:11:05,365
I still can't believe
his father.

233
00:11:06,833 --> 00:11:08,835
You know,
I never did like Dick.

234
00:11:08,868 --> 00:11:09,936
[snickers]

235
00:11:10,937 --> 00:11:12,105
[laughs]

236
00:11:12,138 --> 00:11:13,907
Oh, stop.

237
00:11:15,875 --> 00:11:17,777
[laughs]

238
00:11:17,810 --> 00:11:19,212
Oh God.

239
00:11:19,812 --> 00:11:22,815
[laughs]

240
00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:25,785
After our
closing benediction...

241
00:11:25,818 --> 00:11:26,152
Mint?

242
00:11:26,185 --> 00:11:27,253
[laughs]

243
00:11:27,287 --> 00:11:28,922
...the cantor and I
will lead the congregation

244
00:11:28,955 --> 00:11:30,890
to walk to the East River

245
00:11:30,924 --> 00:11:33,293
where there, together,
we will symbolically

246
00:11:33,326 --> 00:11:34,394
discard our sins
into the moving waters-.

247
00:11:34,427 --> 00:11:35,995
[whispers]
So how is he?

248
00:11:38,197 --> 00:11:40,166
I just worry about
him when he's alone.

249
00:11:40,199 --> 00:11:42,302
There, in the ceremony
of Tashlich,

250
00:11:42,335 --> 00:11:43,336
we have the opportunity...

251
00:11:43,369 --> 00:11:44,938
He asked me
to move in with him.

252
00:11:44,971 --> 00:11:47,073
[normal voice]
Are you crazy?

253
00:11:47,106 --> 00:11:48,141
Shh.

254
00:11:49,108 --> 00:11:51,210
[whispers] You have
got to move past this.

255
00:11:51,244 --> 00:11:52,912
This is not healthy.

256
00:11:52,946 --> 00:11:55,081
We turn now to page
one hundred and twenty...

257
00:11:55,114 --> 00:11:56,115
There, I've said it.

258
00:11:56,149 --> 00:11:57,784
for Avenu Malekeinu.

259
00:11:57,817 --> 00:11:59,519
Would you please rise.

260
00:12:01,321 --> 00:12:03,289
We offer ourselves anew.

261
00:12:03,957 --> 00:12:06,426
[sings in Hebrew]
? Avenu malkeinu sh'ma kolenu.

262
00:12:06,459 --> 00:12:07,360
[whispers]
I love this part.

263
00:12:07,393 --> 00:12:09,362
? Avenu malkeinu
chatanu l'faneycha. ?

264
00:12:09,395 --> 00:12:11,064
[cell phone vibrates]

265
00:12:16,436 --> 00:12:17,003
[sighs]

266
00:12:17,036 --> 00:12:17,937
[whispers]
I'm sorry.

267
00:12:17,971 --> 00:12:19,205
What?

268
00:12:24,577 --> 00:12:25,945
Where is he?

269
00:12:25,979 --> 00:12:26,813
Is he okay?

270
00:12:26,846 --> 00:12:27,614
Please tell me
he's not on the roof.

271
00:12:27,647 --> 00:12:29,515
He locked himself
in the bathroom.

272
00:12:31,384 --> 00:12:32,118
Oh, Charlie.

273
00:12:32,151 --> 00:12:33,152
Thank God.

274
00:12:34,454 --> 00:12:35,588
My shift started
a half hour ago.

275
00:12:35,622 --> 00:12:36,589
I have to get downtown
to the restaurant.

276
00:12:36,623 --> 00:12:38,291
-How long has he been in there?
-
Charlie?

277
00:12:39,926 --> 00:12:41,461
[clears throat]

278
00:12:42,261 --> 00:12:44,564
Sorry,
I was fixing the sink.

279
00:12:44,597 --> 00:12:46,232
Yeah, and a drink?

280
00:12:46,265 --> 00:12:48,167
Yeah, well,

281
00:12:48,201 --> 00:12:51,170
Mother took all the Xanax with
her to Jackson Hole last month.

282
00:12:56,609 --> 00:12:57,810
[sniffles]

283
00:12:57,844 --> 00:13:00,179
Wyatt, you want to be a dear
and get me some more whiskey?

284
00:13:16,129 --> 00:13:17,263
[sighs]

285
00:13:18,564 --> 00:13:21,067
Apparently,
he tied some sheets together.

286
00:13:24,103 --> 00:13:25,171
[sighs]

287
00:13:25,204 --> 00:13:26,272
Although, knowing my
father's delusions of grandeur,

288
00:13:26,305 --> 00:13:30,877
it was probably just
some
Great Escape
{end-italic}plan.

289
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:32,845
You know,
scale the prison walls.

290
00:13:35,415 --> 00:13:38,084
Uh, he's on suicide watch.

291
00:13:41,187 --> 00:13:43,389
[scoffs]

292
00:13:43,423 --> 00:13:44,390
I'm sorry.

293
00:13:44,424 --> 00:13:46,025
I don't want
to talk about it.

294
00:13:54,967 --> 00:13:56,135
Where's Carmen?

295
00:14:00,173 --> 00:14:01,941
She's gone.

296
00:14:05,411 --> 00:14:07,346
I had to um...

297
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:09,982
[sighs]

298
00:14:14,087 --> 00:14:15,455
There's no money, so...

299
00:14:15,488 --> 00:14:17,156
[sniffles]

300
00:14:18,991 --> 00:14:21,561
I'm sorry, I know
that's gauche to talk about,

301
00:14:21,594 --> 00:14:23,529
but it's uh,

302
00:14:25,198 --> 00:14:26,933
they've taken it all back.

303
00:14:29,268 --> 00:14:32,105
Sebastian, we need
to get you outta here.

304
00:14:32,138 --> 00:14:34,307
No, I can't
leave this apartment.

305
00:14:37,744 --> 00:14:39,512
[cries]

306
00:14:41,447 --> 00:14:43,049
[sighs]

307
00:14:43,716 --> 00:14:45,685
Charlie, please.

308
00:14:45,718 --> 00:14:48,287
It's only good
when you're here.

309
00:14:48,321 --> 00:14:49,989
[sighs]

310
00:14:54,694 --> 00:14:58,197
?

311
00:15:22,455 --> 00:15:23,990
(Sebastian) I can't get it.

312
00:15:25,124 --> 00:15:27,026
(Charlie) Are you sure
you know what you're doing?

313
00:15:28,294 --> 00:15:29,395
[grunts]

314
00:15:30,296 --> 00:15:31,330
Okay.

315
00:15:31,798 --> 00:15:33,332
[shrieks]

316
00:15:34,167 --> 00:15:35,568
[laughs]

317
00:15:39,572 --> 00:15:39,906
Oh...!

318
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:42,074
[shrieks]

319
00:15:42,508 --> 00:15:42,842
No!

320
00:15:42,875 --> 00:15:44,143
Oh my God!

321
00:15:44,177 --> 00:15:45,711
[laughs]

322
00:15:49,315 --> 00:15:50,349
[sighs]

323
00:15:53,085 --> 00:15:54,654
Hey, stainless steel wipes?

324
00:15:54,687 --> 00:15:57,156
My mom said
they were essential.

325
00:16:10,570 --> 00:16:11,771
What is this?

326
00:16:11,804 --> 00:16:13,005
Don't touch it.

327
00:16:21,414 --> 00:16:23,749
-It's called Sebastian.
-Hmm.

328
00:16:28,521 --> 00:16:30,189
I was gonna
show it to you later...

329
00:16:30,223 --> 00:16:32,792
but okay.

330
00:16:35,261 --> 00:16:37,597
Well, I think you captured
my beauty quite well.

331
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:44,303
I painted you as
a traditional odalisque.

332
00:16:44,337 --> 00:16:45,571
Mm-hmm.

333
00:16:45,605 --> 00:16:48,207
But by taking the traditionally
male gendered viewer's gaze...

334
00:16:48,241 --> 00:16:48,741
-Mm-hm.
-and setting it

335
00:16:48,774 --> 00:16:50,810
upon a male subject,

336
00:16:50,843 --> 00:16:52,011
I'm essentially

337
00:16:52,044 --> 00:16:52,745
-queering the viewer's eye.
-Queering the viewer's eye.

338
00:16:52,778 --> 00:16:53,613
I know.
You've been saying that

339
00:16:53,646 --> 00:16:54,747
since before you
came out of the closet.

340
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:57,650
[clears throat] I swear to God,
you came out of the womb

341
00:16:57,683 --> 00:16:59,719
with a master's in queer theory.

342
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:08,861
What's that Joubert quote?

343
00:17:08,895 --> 00:17:10,663
[clears throat]

344
00:17:10,696 --> 00:17:16,302
"When my friends are one-eyed,
I look at their profile."

345
00:17:16,335 --> 00:17:17,336
[sighs]

346
00:17:17,370 --> 00:17:19,538
Thank God you only
look at my profile, Charles.

347
00:17:28,881 --> 00:17:31,117
[laughs half-heartedly]

348
00:17:31,884 --> 00:17:34,086
Glass of Pilot Noir
for table three.

349
00:17:35,388 --> 00:17:36,188
[sighs]

350
00:17:36,222 --> 00:17:37,023
It is way too early

351
00:17:37,056 --> 00:17:38,758
to look at something
that depressing.

352
00:17:38,791 --> 00:17:41,327
No, your tips were actually
extra great this week.

353
00:17:42,461 --> 00:17:44,830
Maybe I should get
real person job like London.

354
00:17:44,864 --> 00:17:49,168
Vogue
{end-italic}is a real person job, Urs,
even if it is only part-time.

355
00:17:50,536 --> 00:17:51,904
[chuckles]
Hey,

356
00:17:51,938 --> 00:17:53,406
look who's paying rent
on time this month.

357
00:17:53,439 --> 00:17:54,840
Alright, up top.

358
00:17:56,943 --> 00:17:58,711
I'm gonna walk away.

359
00:17:59,512 --> 00:18:00,813
(Ursula)
You still buy newspapers?

360
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:02,715
(London)
It's a two-page exposé.

361
00:18:06,619 --> 00:18:07,720
(Ursula)
And?

362
00:18:07,753 --> 00:18:09,588
And I didn't get the job.

363
00:18:10,589 --> 00:18:12,792
I thought the final
interview was a formality.

364
00:18:12,825 --> 00:18:14,327
(Charlie)
Hey.
(London)
Yeah, so did I.

365
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:16,429
Okay, so maybe Thatcher
wasn't a good fit for you.

366
00:18:16,462 --> 00:18:17,663
(London)
No.

367
00:18:17,697 --> 00:18:20,266
I didn't get the job
because of this picture,

368
00:18:20,299 --> 00:18:21,000
because of Sebastian.

369
00:18:21,033 --> 00:18:21,434
Shh-shh-shh-shh
shh-shh-shh-shh.

370
00:18:21,467 --> 00:18:22,635
Please, please.

371
00:18:22,668 --> 00:18:25,504
No one our age can get a job.
You think you're special?

372
00:18:26,572 --> 00:18:28,407
What picture?
[door slams]

373
00:18:32,445 --> 00:18:34,680
But didn't they already know
you were working at Blackworth?

374
00:18:34,714 --> 00:18:36,382
Yes, they did.

375
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:39,719
They just didn't know that
I was, how did they put it,

376
00:18:39,752 --> 00:18:41,654
fraternizing with
the heir-apparent

377
00:18:41,687 --> 00:18:43,689
to the most hated
man in New York.

378
00:18:43,723 --> 00:18:48,661
You know, I think I need a break
from all of us for a while.

379
00:18:48,694 --> 00:18:50,496
London, no, come on.

380
00:18:50,529 --> 00:18:51,697
We can just use
the back entrance

381
00:18:51,731 --> 00:18:52,665
of Sebastian's building
from now on.

382
00:18:52,698 --> 00:18:54,400
Charlie, no offense,
but I'm not gonna take

383
00:18:54,433 --> 00:18:56,402
advice from you
right now, about Sebastian.

384
00:18:56,435 --> 00:18:58,571
-Oh, come on..
(London) Look, you guys.

385
00:18:58,604 --> 00:18:59,972
You don't get it.

386
00:19:00,006 --> 00:19:02,808
Things cannot stay the same.

387
00:19:02,842 --> 00:19:04,810
You're being such
a drama queen right now.

388
00:19:04,844 --> 00:19:06,545
God forbid you're
not partner by thirty.

389
00:19:06,579 --> 00:19:07,446
[laughs]

390
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:08,781
Please, Ursula.

391
00:19:08,814 --> 00:19:10,683
(Londom) At least,
I have long term goals.

392
00:19:10,716 --> 00:19:12,218
(Ursula) Yeah!
Oh, of course.

393
00:19:12,251 --> 00:19:13,853
All of that climbing up
the corporate ladder

394
00:19:13,886 --> 00:19:15,588
from Mobile, Alabama
for nothing.

395
00:19:15,621 --> 00:19:16,889
Hey, stop it.
Come on, uh--

396
00:19:16,922 --> 00:19:18,791
Okay, you know what?
It's not for nothing!

397
00:19:18,824 --> 00:19:19,892
And I don't wanna
have to go back there.

398
00:19:19,925 --> 00:19:23,262
So if I don't get a job,
that's what I'm looking at.

399
00:19:23,295 --> 00:19:24,530
I get the money thing.

400
00:19:24,563 --> 00:19:26,232
You think I work two jobs
seven days a week

401
00:19:26,265 --> 00:19:28,234
because it's really fun?

402
00:19:28,267 --> 00:19:31,337
This is a question of loyalty.

403
00:19:31,370 --> 00:19:32,938
[sighs]

404
00:19:32,972 --> 00:19:34,573
I gotta go.

405
00:19:35,541 --> 00:19:36,842
(Charlie) London.

406
00:19:42,415 --> 00:19:44,850
What are we
gonna tell Sebastian?

407
00:19:44,884 --> 00:19:46,218
Nothing.

408
00:20:25,724 --> 00:20:27,726
(Sebastian)
I can't believe he's in there.

409
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:42,942
What do you think?

410
00:20:48,447 --> 00:20:49,682
Nope.

411
00:20:53,352 --> 00:20:54,753
(Sebastian)
Let's go.

412
00:21:02,828 --> 00:21:06,365
[orchestra warming up]

413
00:21:09,869 --> 00:21:11,103
[Charlie whispers]
Why are we even here?

414
00:21:11,137 --> 00:21:12,338
(Ursula)
I told you.

415
00:21:12,371 --> 00:21:14,673
I'm covering the
opening reception forVogue
.

416
00:21:14,707 --> 00:21:16,475
I'm already bored.

417
00:21:16,509 --> 00:21:17,676
[chuckles]
Shh-shh.

418
00:21:18,711 --> 00:21:19,411
[whispers]
Sorry.

419
00:21:19,445 --> 00:21:20,246
[whispers]
Be sophisticated.

420
00:21:21,046 --> 00:21:23,048
One of us should
have stayed with him.

421
00:21:23,082 --> 00:21:25,351
[applause]

422
00:21:39,131 --> 00:21:40,699
Oh my God.

423
00:21:41,433 --> 00:21:42,768
Oh my God, what?

424
00:21:47,606 --> 00:21:49,341
[under breath]
Oh my God.

425
00:21:51,710 --> 00:21:55,381
[playing piano solo]

426
00:22:06,158 --> 00:22:11,397
Tim Mallek, devilishly
handsome star pianist.

427
00:22:12,698 --> 00:22:13,732
Mmm.

428
00:22:15,801 --> 00:22:17,002
Mmm.

429
00:22:17,803 --> 00:22:19,905
Admiral Kinberg.

430
00:22:19,939 --> 00:22:22,575
Hey.
Go forth and investigate.

431
00:22:22,608 --> 00:22:23,943
Go forth.

432
00:22:23,976 --> 00:22:25,644
No, Wyatt.

433
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:29,882
Charlie, from the bar.

434
00:22:30,716 --> 00:22:33,519
Tim, from the on stage.

435
00:22:34,486 --> 00:22:38,023
-Oh God.
-Yes, Tim, from the on stage.

436
00:22:38,057 --> 00:22:40,726
But, you know,
my friends just call me Tim.

437
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:43,596
Colonel, we actually have
to get back to the house to--

438
00:22:43,629 --> 00:22:45,064
Well, Colonel,
let's not use titles

439
00:22:45,097 --> 00:22:46,599
'cause we don't know
what they mean.

440
00:22:46,699 --> 00:22:47,499
Hi.

441
00:22:47,533 --> 00:22:50,869
Uh, Tim, this
is Ursula and Wyatt.

442
00:22:50,903 --> 00:22:52,871
-Guys, this is--
-Tim Mallek.

443
00:22:52,905 --> 00:22:54,974
I remember you both
from the piano bar.

444
00:22:55,007 --> 00:22:56,008
Mmm, mm-hm.

445
00:22:56,041 --> 00:22:59,712
Ursula and I know
each other from high school.

446
00:22:59,745 --> 00:23:01,180
-Ah.
-We need some wine.

447
00:23:01,213 --> 00:23:03,582
And uh, Wyatt is
our token straight boy.

448
00:23:03,616 --> 00:23:05,484
Ah, very useful.

449
00:23:05,517 --> 00:23:07,820
Listen, there's something
that we need to do.

450
00:23:07,853 --> 00:23:09,221
We need to get more wine.

451
00:23:09,255 --> 00:23:10,155
Okay.

452
00:23:10,189 --> 00:23:12,691
And then we have
to go see Sebastian. Yes.

453
00:23:13,259 --> 00:23:15,661
Actually, Tim.
We've got to be going.

454
00:23:15,694 --> 00:23:18,197
-He's waiting for--
-Uh, it was great to meet you.

455
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:20,566
What are you doing?
I was talking.

456
00:23:21,033 --> 00:23:22,801
I can't believe
he's flirting with a guy.

457
00:23:22,835 --> 00:23:24,069
He's an old man.

458
00:23:27,206 --> 00:23:29,942
I should actually
catch up to them.

459
00:23:29,975 --> 00:23:30,776
[cell phone vibrating]

460
00:23:30,809 --> 00:23:32,811
Is that your
boyfriend checking in?

461
00:23:32,845 --> 00:23:34,747
Is he prettier than me?

462
00:23:34,847 --> 00:23:36,915
Can he play Chopin like I can?

463
00:23:36,949 --> 00:23:37,916
No.

464
00:23:37,950 --> 00:23:40,486
No.
No, he's just Sebastian.

465
00:23:40,519 --> 00:23:41,887
He's my best friend.

466
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:42,955
Phew.

467
00:23:42,988 --> 00:23:44,590
So, nothing more.

468
00:23:44,623 --> 00:23:46,725
Is everything okay?

469
00:23:46,759 --> 00:23:48,927
Yeah, he's just
going through some stuff.

470
00:23:50,262 --> 00:23:52,765
Then what's the problem?

471
00:23:52,798 --> 00:23:54,199
(Tim) Come on.
[horn blares]

472
00:23:54,233 --> 00:23:56,235
[laughs]
(Charlie) Oh my God.

473
00:23:57,936 --> 00:24:05,544
So how does a star
concert pianist end up at a bar?

474
00:24:05,577 --> 00:24:06,845
(Tim) Chamber ensemble.

475
00:24:06,879 --> 00:24:08,113
It wasn't that big of a deal.

476
00:24:08,147 --> 00:24:10,616
(Charlie) Chamber ensemble
piano, whatever.

477
00:24:12,017 --> 00:24:16,055
How do you end up at a-
at a hole-in-the-wall

478
00:24:16,088 --> 00:24:18,824
showtunes piano bar?

479
00:24:18,857 --> 00:24:21,960
(Tim) I swear,
nothing makes me happier.

480
00:24:21,994 --> 00:24:25,631
If it paid the bills,
I'd settle down in New York

481
00:24:25,664 --> 00:24:26,932
and play there full time,

482
00:24:26,965 --> 00:24:29,234
instead of moving
from job to job.

483
00:24:29,268 --> 00:24:30,736
Or San Francisco.

484
00:24:30,769 --> 00:24:32,271
(Charlie) San Francisco?

485
00:24:32,304 --> 00:24:34,139
(Tim) Yeah, I love it there.

486
00:24:34,173 --> 00:24:36,709
But this is the dream.

487
00:24:37,843 --> 00:24:41,714
One day I'll be playing
here with the Philharmonic.

488
00:24:43,749 --> 00:24:46,585
(Charlie) This place
reminds me of Rosh Hashanah.

489
00:24:46,618 --> 00:24:47,853
(Tim)
Oh yeah?

490
00:24:47,886 --> 00:24:50,622
(Charlie) Tashlich.
(Tim) Tash what?

491
00:24:50,656 --> 00:24:51,824
[Charlie chuckles]
Tashlich.

492
00:24:51,857 --> 00:24:55,728
It's the service where you
throw your sins into the river.

493
00:24:55,761 --> 00:24:58,030
It's my favorite part
of Rosh Hashanah,

494
00:24:58,063 --> 00:25:00,866
(Tim) I thought Jews
don't believe in sin.

495
00:25:00,899 --> 00:25:02,935
(Charlie) It's a metaphor.

496
00:25:07,339 --> 00:25:09,308
(Tim) Mmm.

497
00:25:09,341 --> 00:25:10,909
I have an idea.

498
00:25:14,947 --> 00:25:16,682
Yalla -

499
00:25:19,351 --> 00:25:21,920
(Charlie) It's okay.
We can see it another time.

500
00:25:21,954 --> 00:25:25,124
Why isn't the Highline
always open like Central Park?

501
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:28,894
Fuck!

502
00:25:33,132 --> 00:25:35,100
I'm sorry.

503
00:25:35,134 --> 00:25:37,669
I just really wanted
to show you this.

504
00:25:38,704 --> 00:25:40,205
I like you.

505
00:25:53,185 --> 00:25:54,953
(Tim)
What are you doing?

506
00:26:19,945 --> 00:26:22,247
It's okay.
It was a valiant effor--

507
00:26:27,453 --> 00:26:29,822
How did you learn
to do that, MacGyver?

508
00:26:29,855 --> 00:26:31,256
Hebrew school.

509
00:26:31,290 --> 00:26:32,391
Seriously?

510
00:26:32,424 --> 00:26:33,926
No.

511
00:26:33,959 --> 00:26:35,627
Who are you?

512
00:26:37,129 --> 00:26:40,699
(Tim) Okay, so I was
twenty-six, your age,

513
00:26:40,732 --> 00:26:44,102
and I was dating this
crazy guy back in Beirut,

514
00:26:44,136 --> 00:26:48,006
and I couldn't bring myself
to break up with him,

515
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:51,243
even though he
was reading my mail,

516
00:26:51,276 --> 00:26:56,248
and we'd fight,
screaming, wrestling fights.

517
00:26:57,449 --> 00:26:59,985
So, instead of
breaking up with him,

518
00:27:00,018 --> 00:27:01,920
I moved to America.

519
00:27:03,755 --> 00:27:04,223
Wow.

520
00:27:04,256 --> 00:27:06,124
Yeah, pretty bad.

521
00:27:06,158 --> 00:27:07,926
Yeah.

522
00:27:08,293 --> 00:27:09,895
Okay.

523
00:27:09,928 --> 00:27:12,030
Tashlich!

524
00:27:12,064 --> 00:27:13,098
[laughs]

525
00:27:13,131 --> 00:27:14,833
(Tim) What?

526
00:27:14,867 --> 00:27:17,369
You don't have
to yell "Tashlich."

527
00:27:17,402 --> 00:27:19,304
Sin-throwing is fun.

528
00:27:19,471 --> 00:27:20,706
Your turn.

529
00:27:22,474 --> 00:27:24,710
When I was eleven,

530
00:27:24,743 --> 00:27:27,412
I was living with
Sebastian and his family

531
00:27:27,446 --> 00:27:28,981
for a few months.

532
00:27:29,014 --> 00:27:31,884
My mom and I were
going through...

533
00:27:31,917 --> 00:27:33,819
Uh, it was bad.

534
00:27:33,852 --> 00:27:38,824
And I would not come out
from under the bed for days.

535
00:27:38,857 --> 00:27:43,795
So, Sebastian climbed under
and stayed with me for hours,

536
00:27:43,829 --> 00:27:45,497
just holding my hand.

537
00:27:45,531 --> 00:27:52,471
I wouldn't stop crying,
and so he kissed me.

538
00:27:52,504 --> 00:27:54,806
On the lips.

539
00:27:56,441 --> 00:27:58,110
It was so soft.

540
00:27:59,411 --> 00:28:01,480
Only two or three seconds,
but it was enough time for me

541
00:28:01,513 --> 00:28:03,515
to realize that I was...

542
00:28:03,549 --> 00:28:06,818
different from other boys.

543
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:09,855
Which was scary.

544
00:28:11,323 --> 00:28:13,125
And so the next day,
I told everyone at school

545
00:28:13,158 --> 00:28:17,095
that he had kissed me,
that he was "a gay."

546
00:28:18,063 --> 00:28:20,299
So, what happened?

547
00:28:20,332 --> 00:28:23,068
Sebastian wore his mother's
pink nail polish to school

548
00:28:23,101 --> 00:28:24,069
the next day.

549
00:28:24,102 --> 00:28:25,137
-No.
-Yeah.

550
00:28:25,170 --> 00:28:26,238
(chuckles)

551
00:28:27,406 --> 00:28:30,442
Anyway, fifteen years later,
I still feel bad about it.

552
00:28:31,043 --> 00:28:35,013
Right, let's
see what you got.

553
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:37,282
[grunts]

554
00:28:40,552 --> 00:28:42,254
Okay, now give me a good one.

555
00:28:42,287 --> 00:28:43,188
What?

556
00:28:43,221 --> 00:28:45,090
That wasn't good?

557
00:28:45,123 --> 00:28:46,892
I outed my best friend.

558
00:28:46,925 --> 00:28:48,393
When you were eleven.

559
00:28:50,562 --> 00:28:52,397
Fine, I'll go.

560
00:28:56,134 --> 00:29:01,206
Last Christmas, I punched
my father right in the face.

561
00:29:01,239 --> 00:29:02,874
Knocked him out.

562
00:29:02,908 --> 00:29:04,476
Blood, everything.

563
00:29:05,577 --> 00:29:07,312
Seriously?

564
00:29:07,346 --> 00:29:10,048
Well, he drinks,
and sometimes with my mom,

565
00:29:10,082 --> 00:29:12,784
he's just, he's not very nice.

566
00:29:14,252 --> 00:29:17,155
For a second,
I thought I'd killed him,

567
00:29:17,189 --> 00:29:18,991
and I didn't care.

568
00:29:21,493 --> 00:29:23,362
That's a terrible thing,
isn't it?

569
00:29:26,598 --> 00:29:30,402
You ever do anything
like that to your old man?

570
00:29:30,435 --> 00:29:31,837
No.

571
00:29:33,972 --> 00:29:37,309
He died when I was eleven.

572
00:29:37,342 --> 00:29:39,077
I'm sorry.

573
00:29:39,111 --> 00:29:41,980
Well, that explains
the crying under the bed.

574
00:29:42,014 --> 00:29:43,181
It's okay.

575
00:29:43,215 --> 00:29:45,117
We weren't very close.

576
00:29:45,150 --> 00:29:46,952
It wasn't much of a loss.

577
00:29:50,222 --> 00:29:52,924
Gay men and their dads.

578
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:57,596
I think we need both of us
to hoist this one over.

579
00:29:57,629 --> 00:29:59,131
[laughs]

580
00:29:59,164 --> 00:30:04,102
(Tim) One, two, three.

581
00:30:04,136 --> 00:30:05,337
(Both) Tashlich!

582
00:30:16,214 --> 00:30:17,249
Hey!

583
00:30:17,282 --> 00:30:18,183
Shit.

584
00:30:18,216 --> 00:30:19,418
You know you're
not supposed to be here.

585
00:30:19,451 --> 00:30:20,318
[Tim laughs]

586
00:30:20,352 --> 00:30:22,587
(Tim)
Slow down.

587
00:30:22,621 --> 00:30:24,289
[Charlie laughs]

588

589

Major-General ?

? has never sat a gee.

591
00:31:16,975 --> 00:31:18,176

? has never sat a sat a gee.

595
00:31:23,582 --> 00:31:24,382
? For my military knowledge

596
00:31:24,416 --> 00:31:25,684
? though I'm plucky
and adventury ?

597
00:31:25,717 --> 00:31:28,053
? has only been brought down to
the beginning of the century ?

598
00:31:28,086 --> 00:31:30,288
? But still, in matters
vegetable, animal, and mineral ?

599
00:31:30,322 --> 00:31:33,225
? I am the very model
of a modern Major-General. ?

600
00:31:33,258 --> 00:31:35,427
[laughs]

601
00:31:35,460 --> 00:31:36,695
I did it.

602
00:31:40,766 --> 00:31:46,505
?

603
00:33:22,367 --> 00:33:24,236
[soothing voice on tape]
Give yourself permission

604
00:33:24,269 --> 00:33:25,804
to leave your day behind.

605
00:33:25,837 --> 00:33:28,206
(Charlie)
This help's you relax?

606
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:31,409
[tape continues...]
[Charlie snickers]

607
00:33:31,443 --> 00:33:34,779
(Charlie) Why are there whales?
(Tim) Shut up.

00:33:34,813 --> 00:33:37,282
[Charlie snorts]
(Tim) They're very soothing.

[Charlie laughs]

610
00:33:44,322 --> 00:33:46,691
I love seeing you in my shirt.

611
00:33:53,865 --> 00:33:57,235
Tim, I need
to tell you something.

612
00:33:57,269 --> 00:33:58,403
What?

613
00:34:00,238 --> 00:34:03,608
'Cause I wanna
be honest with you...

614
00:34:03,642 --> 00:34:06,077
'cause I like you.

615
00:34:09,881 --> 00:34:11,249
I lied to you.

616
00:34:15,186 --> 00:34:18,356
I tell people my father's dead
all the time, but...

617
00:34:21,559 --> 00:34:25,230
the truth is he left
when I was eleven.

618
00:34:26,264 --> 00:34:27,699
Just left.

619
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:30,635
Never said goodbye.

620
00:34:33,371 --> 00:34:36,808
Sebastian knows the truth, but
[inhales]

621
00:34:36,841 --> 00:34:39,577
with everyone else, it's just
easier to say he's dead.

622
00:34:41,846 --> 00:34:46,117
He lives in Long Island now,
with his new family,

623
00:34:47,552 --> 00:34:49,220
which is fine.

624
00:34:50,655 --> 00:34:52,223
I never really see him.

625
00:34:55,493 --> 00:34:57,896
Anyway, I wanted to tell you.

626
00:34:59,531 --> 00:35:01,433
'Cause that's what
boyfriends do, right?

627
00:35:01,466 --> 00:35:02,801
They tell each other things.

628
00:35:22,420 --> 00:35:23,755
Boyfriends.

? Three little maids
from school are we... ?

Oh!

It's a fucking
mess in here, guys.

so we're making him....

(Charlie) Jesus Christ.

...happier.

639
00:36:14,706 --> 00:36:16,408
(Wyatt)
Oh, no.
- We're making him happier.

640
00:36:17,342 --> 00:36:18,376
There you are.

641
00:36:18,410 --> 00:36:20,912
I- I'd completely
forgotten what you look like.

Yes.

have invited you,

that you have been.

Wanna toss some with us?

Let me show you.

654
00:36:49,541 --> 00:36:51,409
Let me show you.
Wanna toss that in the air?

655
00:36:51,443 --> 00:36:52,243
Like this.

656
00:36:52,277 --> 00:36:53,545
This isn't what
he needs right now.

657
00:36:53,578 --> 00:36:54,546
Well, I think you're wrong.

658
00:36:54,579 --> 00:36:56,614
I actually think this
exactly what he needs.

I can- I can take it from here.

You don't think we can take it?

just fine without you

Oh, you're not
staying with Jim tonight?

You know his name is Tim.

And, no, he has rehearsal.

672
00:37:47,465 --> 00:37:49,534
He's too old for you.

673
00:37:50,101 --> 00:37:51,970
I don't know what you
could possibly see in him.

674
00:38:05,416 --> 00:38:07,418
I didn't think
I'd miss him, you know?

675
00:38:09,621 --> 00:38:11,623
He ruined my life,

676
00:38:11,656 --> 00:38:13,091
and I miss him.

677
00:38:15,426 --> 00:38:16,995
He's still your father.

678
00:38:19,931 --> 00:38:21,699
Of course you miss him.

679
00:38:25,670 --> 00:38:27,505
Do you ever miss your dad?

00:38:29,707 --> 00:38:31,609
All the time.

Yeah?

Do you...

684
00:38:48,193 --> 00:38:50,528
do you think I'm a good person?

685
00:38:54,766 --> 00:38:56,100
Of course.

686
00:38:57,735 --> 00:39:00,071
You had to think about it.

687
00:39:00,104 --> 00:39:02,407
That can't be good.

00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:18,389
you're not a good person.

You're the best person I know.

691
00:39:30,735 --> 00:39:33,471
Well, you're the only one
that thinks so.

692
00:39:36,207 --> 00:39:37,208
Please.

693
00:39:37,242 --> 00:39:39,110
I'm begging you.
He misses you.

00:39:39,143 --> 00:39:41,479
He needs you.
You're the responsible one.

-He does not need me.
-Fine, I need you.

with Sebastian.

It's all about Sebastian
all the time.

They grow apart.

It's okay.

I'll just be a minute.

-No.

Oh my God.

Maybe breaking into places
can be our thing.

722
00:41:13,237 --> 00:41:14,605
Your turn.

723
00:41:16,341 --> 00:41:17,742
Come on.

724
00:41:28,186 --> 00:41:29,687
[sighs]

725
00:41:31,089 --> 00:41:33,191
You pushy Lebanese.

726
00:41:33,224 --> 00:41:35,093
[laughs]

727
00:41:35,126 --> 00:41:36,828
You- you uh-- Okay, why not?

728
00:41:36,861 --> 00:41:39,063
Uh, okay.
[playing piano]

729
00:41:42,900 --> 00:41:49,340
? Take a pair
of sparkling eyes ?

730
00:41:49,374 --> 00:41:54,912
? hidden ever and anon.

731
00:41:56,948 --> 00:41:58,316
What?

732
00:41:59,617 --> 00:42:00,685
I love you.

733
00:42:03,087 --> 00:42:05,223
I know we haven't been
seeing each other for that long,

734
00:42:05,256 --> 00:42:07,892
but that's just what I feel.

735
00:42:07,925 --> 00:42:09,160
I love you.

736
00:42:11,696 --> 00:42:12,964
Wow, I uh--

737
00:42:12,997 --> 00:42:15,032
You don't have to say
anything yet. It's okay.

738
00:42:17,635 --> 00:42:19,704
I know you feel the same.

739
00:42:30,214 --> 00:42:32,016
Um...

740
00:42:33,785 --> 00:42:35,286
What's wrong?

741
00:42:35,820 --> 00:42:37,188
How do you know?

742
00:42:37,221 --> 00:42:38,723
[chuckles]

743
00:42:39,657 --> 00:42:43,294
How do I know?
I just do.

744
00:42:43,327 --> 00:42:46,764
When I'm with you, I never
want to be anywhere else.

745
00:42:46,898 --> 00:42:48,166
I love you, Charlie.

746
00:42:56,307 --> 00:42:57,875
Uh...

747
00:42:57,975 --> 00:42:59,310
What is it?

748
00:43:01,412 --> 00:43:03,815
I don't know.
It's a lot to process.

749
00:43:08,953 --> 00:43:10,855
I mean, I like you so much.

750
00:43:12,223 --> 00:43:15,159
I guess I just didn't realize...

751
00:43:17,862 --> 00:43:19,163
[sighs]

752
00:43:19,697 --> 00:43:21,232
It's this friend of yours,

753
00:43:22,900 --> 00:43:24,402
-I knew it.
-What?

754
00:43:25,136 --> 00:43:26,337
You and the Blackworth kid.

755
00:43:26,370 --> 00:43:27,672
No.

756
00:43:27,705 --> 00:43:29,674
-God.
-Wait, you know who he is?

757
00:43:29,707 --> 00:43:33,344
Everyone in New York
knows who he is.

758
00:43:33,377 --> 00:43:34,745
[sighs]

759
00:43:34,846 --> 00:43:35,880
Hey.

760
00:43:36,814 --> 00:43:38,749
How could you
be in love with that guy?

761
00:43:38,783 --> 00:43:39,951
What?

762
00:43:39,984 --> 00:43:40,751
Don't say it like that.

763
00:43:40,785 --> 00:43:42,086
You don't know him.

764
00:43:42,453 --> 00:43:43,855
So what?

765
00:43:43,888 --> 00:43:45,957
Have you been sleeping
with him all this time?

766
00:43:45,990 --> 00:43:47,425
No!

767
00:43:47,458 --> 00:43:49,093
Sebastian and I have never...

768
00:43:49,126 --> 00:43:50,394
anything, ever.

769
00:43:52,497 --> 00:43:53,464
But you're in love with him?

770
00:43:53,498 --> 00:43:54,432
No.

771
00:43:54,465 --> 00:43:56,100
I mean, how could I be? No.

772
00:44:04,809 --> 00:44:05,977
You don't get it.

773
00:44:06,010 --> 00:44:06,477
Oh yeah.

774
00:44:06,511 --> 00:44:08,713
Please, I get it.

775
00:44:08,746 --> 00:44:10,882
Everyone has a Sebastian.

776
00:44:14,485 --> 00:44:15,887
Hey.

777
00:44:18,956 --> 00:44:20,091
[whispers]
Hey.

778
00:44:23,094 --> 00:44:24,195
Listen.

779
00:44:25,930 --> 00:44:27,498
I wanna be with you.

780
00:44:27,532 --> 00:44:28,099
[scoffs]

781
00:44:28,132 --> 00:44:30,368
Okay?

782
00:44:30,401 --> 00:44:32,336
It doesn't matter.

783
00:44:35,106 --> 00:44:36,107
You're so young.

784
00:44:36,140 --> 00:44:37,975
I forget sometimes.

785
00:44:39,944 --> 00:44:41,145
What?

786
00:44:43,147 --> 00:44:45,149
You think you
don't deserve love?

787
00:44:46,450 --> 00:44:47,752
[scoffs]

788
00:44:47,785 --> 00:44:48,886
Whoa.

789
00:44:48,920 --> 00:44:50,888
Way to take
a huge leap there, Tim.

790
00:44:50,922 --> 00:44:52,924
Let me tell
you how this ends.

791
00:44:52,957 --> 00:44:54,492
You don't end up
with your Sebastian.

792
00:44:54,525 --> 00:44:56,928
It's not real love.

793
00:44:56,961 --> 00:45:01,032
It's a childhood obsession,
an idea of a person.

794
00:45:01,065 --> 00:45:05,036
And really,
it's a poor excuse.

795
00:45:05,069 --> 00:45:05,870
What?

796
00:45:05,903 --> 00:45:07,471
Like this fucked up
umbilical cord,

797
00:45:07,505 --> 00:45:10,074
so you never have to open
yourself up to anyone.

798
00:45:11,309 --> 00:45:12,843
[sighs]

799
00:45:13,277 --> 00:45:14,812
[voice breaks]
Wait, Tim! I--

800
00:45:14,845 --> 00:45:15,947
It's okay. You know, just...

801
00:45:15,980 --> 00:45:19,383
call me when you're ready
to let someone else in.

802
00:45:23,854 --> 00:45:24,956
[gasps]

803
00:45:24,989 --> 00:45:28,459
?

804
00:45:28,492 --> 00:45:29,360
Wyatt!

805
00:45:29,393 --> 00:45:32,263
God, I love this holiday.

806
00:45:32,296 --> 00:45:35,199
(Wyatt)
Indians, your land is mine!

807
00:45:35,933 --> 00:45:36,901
(Ursula)
Your hat looks weird.

808
00:45:36,934 --> 00:45:39,203
You know, I think
I'm gonna do a lap first.

809
00:45:40,137 --> 00:45:42,306
Kinberg, where's Tim?

810
00:45:42,340 --> 00:45:43,908
Don't wanna talk about it.

811
00:45:45,610 --> 00:45:48,212
(Ursula) Hmm?
(Wyatt) You got it.

812
00:45:48,245 --> 00:45:49,814
Oh, okay.

813
00:45:53,918 --> 00:45:55,386
[slurps through straw]

814
00:45:57,922 --> 00:45:59,557
(Ursula)
Okay.

815
00:45:59,590 --> 00:46:00,524
Whoa there, esé.

816
00:46:00,558 --> 00:46:03,194
No, honestly, I'm so-
I'm so fine, Ursula.

817
00:46:05,096 --> 00:46:08,232
I can have as much drinks
as I want because I'm dumped.

818
00:46:08,265 --> 00:46:09,400
Well--

819
00:46:11,602 --> 00:46:14,238
Yeah, I know. I'm sorry.

820
00:46:15,906 --> 00:46:17,408
Tim doesn't understand.

821
00:46:19,644 --> 00:46:21,812
Why don't people
understand us, Ursula?

822
00:46:23,614 --> 00:46:25,082
We've got each other.

823
00:46:26,951 --> 00:46:29,520
[sighs]
Okay, enough about Tim.

824
00:46:31,022 --> 00:46:33,224
What's up with you?
What's happenin' with Ursula?

825
00:46:34,325 --> 00:46:35,559
Hmm?

826
00:46:36,894 --> 00:46:41,432
Well, a new, full-time
position opened up at
Vogue
{end-italic}.

827
00:46:41,465 --> 00:46:45,136
-Cultural Features Editor.
-Amazing.

828
00:46:45,169 --> 00:46:47,171
I don't know if I'm gonna
put myself up for it, though.

829
00:46:47,938 --> 00:46:49,173
What?
Why wouldn't you?

830
00:46:49,206 --> 00:46:51,909
Just- I just don't know if it's
like the right time, you know?

831
00:46:51,942 --> 00:46:53,577
No, no.

832
00:46:55,279 --> 00:46:56,947
Plus, what if I don't get it?

833
00:46:58,683 --> 00:47:00,484
It's my dream job.

834
00:47:02,653 --> 00:47:05,456
There's nothing more depressing
than the death of a dream.

835
00:47:11,028 --> 00:47:13,297
(Charlie)
What if we never get our dreams?

836
00:47:15,232 --> 00:47:17,368
You want to know
whose fault it is?

837
00:47:17,401 --> 00:47:19,003
Yeah, I could take a guess.

838
00:47:19,270 --> 00:47:20,971
Bill Clinton.

839
00:47:22,039 --> 00:47:22,973
Wow.

840
00:47:23,007 --> 00:47:25,643
I would not-
I would not have guessed that.

841
00:47:25,676 --> 00:47:28,312
No, because when we were
growing up, Bill lied to us,

842
00:47:28,345 --> 00:47:32,116
because he said,
that you could do anything.

843
00:47:32,149 --> 00:47:36,420
You could be a dreamer during
the- the Clinton administration.

844
00:47:36,454 --> 00:47:37,188
You remember that?

845
00:47:37,221 --> 00:47:38,255
Yeah, dude.

846
00:47:40,091 --> 00:47:44,562
Tim just dumped you
because of Bill Clinton.

847
00:47:44,595 --> 00:47:47,164
What? No, shut up.
You're ridiculous.

848
00:47:47,198 --> 00:47:49,033
That's what you said, right?

849
00:47:49,233 --> 00:47:50,301
Oh.

850
00:47:51,168 --> 00:47:52,269
[slurps]

851
00:47:52,303 --> 00:47:53,671
(Ursula)
Charlie?

852
00:47:53,704 --> 00:47:56,507
You gotta put yourself
up for that job, Ursula.

853
00:47:58,042 --> 00:48:00,544
You have to go after
the things you want in life.

854
00:48:05,382 --> 00:48:06,684
You gonna boot?

855
00:48:07,218 --> 00:48:09,019
Where's your uh, hidden cave?

856
00:48:09,053 --> 00:48:10,688
Tell me it's closer
than Transylvania.

857
00:48:10,721 --> 00:48:12,556
Yeah, it is.
It's in Bushwick.

858
00:48:12,590 --> 00:48:13,991
[laughs]

859
00:48:15,192 --> 00:48:16,527
Doesn't anyone
live in Manhattan anymore?

860
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:18,429
Oh, don't worry, little lamb.

861
00:48:18,462 --> 00:48:20,598
-I'll protect you.
-Little Lamb?

862
00:48:20,631 --> 00:48:22,566
I don't know
if anyone told you,

863
00:48:22,600 --> 00:48:25,536
but I'm really a wolf
in sheep's clothing...

864
00:48:30,574 --> 00:48:34,044
Why don't you go get us a drink?

865
00:48:34,078 --> 00:48:36,347
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

866
00:48:42,286 --> 00:48:45,589
He's cute, right?

867
00:48:45,623 --> 00:48:46,991
A Ginger?

868
00:48:47,024 --> 00:48:48,092
[chuckles]

869
00:48:49,193 --> 00:48:50,494
Who knew there were
so many cute boys in Brooklyn?

870
00:48:53,330 --> 00:48:56,100
Yeah, I really should invite him
back to the apartment,

871
00:48:56,133 --> 00:48:58,736
but you know how these boys
scare so easily about money.

872
00:49:19,824 --> 00:49:21,091
[laughs]

873
00:49:21,125 --> 00:49:23,661
Charlie. Uh.

874
00:49:33,404 --> 00:49:35,339
[chuckles]
Good fangs.

875
00:49:36,540 --> 00:49:38,042
God, you bit my nose.

876
00:49:38,075 --> 00:49:40,144
Who bites someone's nose?

877
00:49:40,177 --> 00:49:42,012
-Stop it!
-We can practice.

878
00:49:43,714 --> 00:49:45,216
[sighs deeply]

879
00:49:45,382 --> 00:49:48,319
[laughter/talking
coming from other room]

880
00:49:57,528 --> 00:49:59,196
You're an asshole!

881
00:49:59,230 --> 00:50:00,264
[clears throat]
What?

882
00:50:00,297 --> 00:50:02,299
Are we just
not gonna talk about it?

883
00:50:02,333 --> 00:50:02,800
(Sebastian)
What?

884
00:50:02,833 --> 00:50:03,634
I know you know.

885
00:50:03,667 --> 00:50:05,069
I know you know
my feelings for you.

886
00:50:05,102 --> 00:50:06,337
What are you doing?
Get out.

887
00:50:06,370 --> 00:50:07,705
-Should I go?
(Sebastian)
No.

888
00:50:07,738 --> 00:50:09,506
My friend, he's just
having a little stroke.

889
00:50:09,540 --> 00:50:10,841
You just like
the attention, right?

890
00:50:10,875 --> 00:50:12,610
You just use me to feel
better about yourself?

891
00:50:12,643 --> 00:50:14,111
Can we talk
about this later?

892
00:50:14,144 --> 00:50:16,280
No, I waited fifteen years
to talk about this.

893
00:50:16,313 --> 00:50:17,748
We're talking about this.

894
00:50:17,781 --> 00:50:19,450
Great.
Well, then you can watch.

895
00:50:24,154 --> 00:50:25,389
I kissed you.

896
00:50:25,422 --> 00:50:27,625
Yeah, you were drunk.
It happens.

897
00:50:27,658 --> 00:50:28,826
And we'll talk about it
in the morning.

898
00:50:28,859 --> 00:50:30,160
-I should go.
(Sebastian)
No.

899
00:50:30,194 --> 00:50:32,162
Why him, huh?
Why not me?

900
00:50:32,196 --> 00:50:34,131

01:08:13,623 --> 01:08:16,459
Y'all, they don't even
have desk chairs.

1082
01:08:16,492 --> 01:08:17,460
We sit on bouncy balls.

1083
01:08:17,493 --> 01:08:18,661
[laughter]

1084
01:08:18,695 --> 01:08:20,430
Are you sure that you work
at an actual internet start-up

1085
01:08:20,463 --> 01:08:21,731
and not just
some hippie commune

1086
01:08:21,764 --> 01:08:23,466
that you accidentally
wandered into?

1087
01:08:24,434 --> 01:08:26,736
(Wyatt)
Uh, Ursula
has some news as well.

1088
01:08:26,769 --> 01:08:27,470
I don't.

1089
01:08:27,503 --> 01:08:29,839
No-no-no.
I'm proud of you.

1090
01:08:29,872 --> 01:08:33,176
Ursula is now the
Cultural Features Editor

1091
01:08:33,209 --> 01:08:35,445
at
Vogue's
{end-italic}website.

1092
01:08:35,478 --> 01:08:36,612
-Yay!
-That's amazing.

1093
01:08:36,646 --> 01:08:38,214
It's just digital,
so it's not--

1094
01:08:38,247 --> 01:08:39,315
I'm so proud of you.

1095
01:08:42,485 --> 01:08:46,589
So, Tim, how are things
at that ghastly old piano bar?

1096
01:08:46,622 --> 01:08:47,857
Hmm.

1097
01:08:47,890 --> 01:08:51,461
Well, I actually just got a job
at the San Francisco Orchestra.

1098
01:08:51,494 --> 01:08:52,729
Principal pianist.

1099
01:08:52,762 --> 01:08:53,863
Wow.

1100
01:08:53,896 --> 01:08:54,597
Oh my God.

1101
01:08:54,630 --> 01:08:55,465
Oh my God, dude.
That's great.

1102
01:08:55,498 --> 01:08:56,866
San Francisco?

1103
01:08:57,800 --> 01:08:58,868
[chuckles]

1104
01:08:58,901 --> 01:09:00,336
Congratulations.

1105
01:09:00,370 --> 01:09:01,504
Thanks, man.

1106
01:09:01,604 --> 01:09:03,639
Well, we'll be
sad to see you go.

1107
01:09:04,574 --> 01:09:06,943
Charlie,
you must be devastated.

1108
01:09:06,976 --> 01:09:08,211
Mm-hm.

1109
01:09:08,244 --> 01:09:11,280
Ooh, and after you learned
all that Gilbert and Sullivan.

1110
01:09:11,314 --> 01:09:12,215
[laughter]

1111
01:09:12,248 --> 01:09:14,784
Yeah, why all
that Gilbert and Sullivan?

1112
01:09:14,817 --> 01:09:16,919
Well, for one, it's right
in my vocal wheelhouse.

1113
01:09:16,953 --> 01:09:17,754
Mmm.

1114
01:09:17,787 --> 01:09:18,788
You don't have
a vocal wheelhouse.

1115
01:09:18,821 --> 01:09:19,789
Actually,

1116
01:09:19,822 --> 01:09:22,492
it was Sebastian's dad
that introduced us...

1117
01:09:22,525 --> 01:09:23,726
to it.

1118
01:09:25,495 --> 01:09:26,863
It's okay.

1119
01:09:28,498 --> 01:09:31,567
No, it's nice to
remember the good things.

1120
01:09:32,502 --> 01:09:34,270
Anyway,

1121
01:09:34,303 --> 01:09:35,938
I'm ready for a fresh start.

1122
01:09:37,607 --> 01:09:41,310
And I feel like having us
all here, finally, is--

1123
01:09:41,344 --> 01:09:42,879
[sighs]

1124
01:09:42,912 --> 01:09:44,947
I don't know, I feel like things
are really gonna be okay.

1125
01:09:47,550 --> 01:09:48,785
To...

1126
01:09:49,819 --> 01:09:51,521
new beginnings.

1127
01:09:52,955 --> 01:09:55,425
To new beginnings.

1128
01:09:55,458 --> 01:09:57,360
Hmm.

1129
01:09:57,393 --> 01:09:57,960
Cheers.

1130
01:09:57,994 --> 01:09:59,662
[glasses clink]

1131
01:10:00,430 --> 01:10:01,531
[sighs]

1132
01:10:01,564 --> 01:10:03,232
I'm also selling the apartment.

1133
01:10:04,367 --> 01:10:05,568
I'm selling everything,
actually.

1134
01:10:05,601 --> 01:10:06,836
And I'm gonna take the money,

1135
01:10:06,869 --> 01:10:10,339
and I'm gonna give it
to all the people uh--

1136
01:10:10,373 --> 01:10:11,441
You know.

1137
01:10:12,041 --> 01:10:13,543
I'm proud of you.

1138
01:10:13,576 --> 01:10:14,677
Me, too.

1139
01:10:16,779 --> 01:10:20,049
So I thought maybe I could
stay with you and your mom...

1140
01:10:20,083 --> 01:10:22,852
just for a little while
until I get on my feet.

1141
01:10:22,952 --> 01:10:24,454
What do you say?

1142
01:10:26,055 --> 01:10:28,858
Um, well,

1143
01:10:29,959 --> 01:10:31,694
it- it's just--
[sighs]

1144
01:10:31,727 --> 01:10:34,430
Um, you wanna-

1145
01:10:34,464 --> 01:10:36,032
you wanna
talk about this later?

1146
01:10:38,734 --> 01:10:40,503
Charlie, why?

1147
01:10:40,536 --> 01:10:41,571
What could you have to say

1148
01:10:41,604 --> 01:10:42,972
that you couldn't say
in front of everyone?

1149
01:10:43,005 --> 01:10:44,674
I mean,
we're all family, right?

1150
01:10:44,707 --> 01:10:46,642
Why don't I go get us
some more wine?

1151
01:10:47,743 --> 01:10:49,045
Is this about Halloween?

1152
01:10:49,078 --> 01:10:51,047
-Sebastian.
-What?

1153
01:10:51,080 --> 01:10:52,315
(Tim)
Halloween?

1154
01:10:53,783 --> 01:10:54,717
What?
You didn't tell him?

1155
01:10:54,750 --> 01:10:56,586
-Sebastian.
-What happened on Halloween?

1156
01:10:56,619 --> 01:10:57,587
Maybe you'd know, London,

1157
01:10:57,620 --> 01:10:59,689
if you weren't so quick
to abandon your friends.

1158
01:10:59,722 --> 01:11:00,823
Okay.

1159
01:11:00,857 --> 01:11:01,624
Sebastian, that's a conversation
that you and I should--

1160
01:11:01,657 --> 01:11:03,092
He's a fantastic kisser,
isn't he?

1161
01:11:03,126 --> 01:11:04,127
Sebastian.

1162
01:11:04,160 --> 01:11:05,461
(Wyatt)
Why don't we
put on some music?

1163
01:11:05,495 --> 01:11:07,430
(Ursula)
That is a great idea.
How about a little Mikado?

1164
01:11:07,463 --> 01:11:08,030
? Mikado!

1165
01:11:08,064 --> 01:11:09,732
Talk to me. Hey.

1166
01:11:10,833 --> 01:11:12,835
Sebastian, we are
here to investigate.

1167
01:11:12,869 --> 01:11:14,370
-Would you shut up, Ursula!
(Wyatt)
Hey!

1168
01:11:14,403 --> 01:11:15,838
Don't speak to her that way.

1169
01:11:15,872 --> 01:11:17,607
Look, whatever happened,
I don't care.

1170
01:11:17,640 --> 01:11:19,976
I know I've got you now, okay?

1171
01:11:21,144 --> 01:11:22,812
What does that mean?

1172
01:11:32,121 --> 01:11:33,923
[sighs]

1173
01:11:33,956 --> 01:11:35,525
I'm going with Tim.

1174
01:11:37,560 --> 01:11:38,961
(London)
What?

1175
01:11:38,995 --> 01:11:40,163
(Ursula)
Wait, what?

1176
01:11:40,196 --> 01:11:42,398
(Charlie)
I didn't want
to talk about this today.

1177
01:11:42,431 --> 01:11:43,666
(London)
Charlie, when?

1178
01:11:45,635 --> 01:11:48,004
Uh, after New Year's.

1179
01:11:48,704 --> 01:11:50,740
Is this really a good time
to bring this up right now?

1180
01:11:50,773 --> 01:11:51,641
(London)
Charlie, what about school?

1181
01:11:51,674 --> 01:11:53,442
(Charlie)
I'm working on my thesis,

1182
01:11:53,476 --> 01:11:55,044
and I- I can do that anywhere.

1183
01:11:56,078 --> 01:11:58,581
I know it's fast, but um,

1184
01:12:00,149 --> 01:12:01,684
I love him.

1185
01:12:02,785 --> 01:12:04,987
So, can someone
turn off the music?

1186
01:12:05,021 --> 01:12:06,923
What?

1187
01:12:06,956 --> 01:12:08,658
I think this is great!

1188
01:12:10,126 --> 01:12:12,528
Guys, look at him.
He's happy.

1189
01:12:13,829 --> 01:12:15,531
You know,
whenever you find love,

1190
01:12:15,565 --> 01:12:17,567
I think that you should uh,

1191
01:12:17,600 --> 01:12:19,502
dive right in, you know?

1192
01:12:21,537 --> 01:12:26,809
Look, uh, buddy,
if you need a place to stay,

1193
01:12:26,842 --> 01:12:28,678
you can stay at my place.

1194
01:12:29,612 --> 01:12:31,681
It's not much, but--

1195
01:12:32,882 --> 01:12:34,550
-Okay.
-Seba-

1196
01:12:37,186 --> 01:12:38,554
You guys, is he--

1197
01:12:38,921 --> 01:12:39,855
(Charlie)
Shit!
-Oh my God.

1198
01:12:39,889 --> 01:12:41,057
No, no.

1199
01:12:41,090 --> 01:12:42,491
You'll just make it worse.

1200
01:12:43,759 --> 01:12:44,961
Sebastian!

1201
01:12:53,769 --> 01:12:56,072
Sebastian, come down.

1202
01:12:56,105 --> 01:12:57,540
[breathing heavily]

1203
01:12:57,573 --> 01:12:59,809
Just get down.
Let's talk about this.

1204
01:13:01,677 --> 01:13:03,079
You were right to leave.

1205
01:13:04,847 --> 01:13:05,915
You found a way to be happy,

1206
01:13:05,948 --> 01:13:07,049
and it has
nothing to do with me.

1207
01:13:07,083 --> 01:13:09,619
No, that's not true.

1208
01:13:09,652 --> 01:13:12,021
Just- just get down,
Sebastian.

1209
01:13:13,723 --> 01:13:14,957
[sighs]

1210
01:13:16,492 --> 01:13:18,027
I knew about the transfers.

1211
01:13:19,662 --> 01:13:20,563
What?

1212
01:13:20,596 --> 01:13:21,897
I knew he was
moving customer money,

1213
01:13:21,931 --> 01:13:23,733
and I knew it was illegal,

1214
01:13:23,766 --> 01:13:25,968
and I- I--

1215
01:13:26,002 --> 01:13:28,104
[cries]

1216
01:13:29,639 --> 01:13:31,707
I didn't say anything.

1217
01:13:32,775 --> 01:13:35,945
I could have stopped him,
you know, and I didn't.

1218
01:13:37,246 --> 01:13:39,582
They're right to hate me.

1219
01:13:39,615 --> 01:13:40,549
No.

1220
01:13:40,583 --> 01:13:41,584
No.

1221
01:13:42,184 --> 01:13:43,919
I see you.

1222
01:13:44,954 --> 01:13:47,023
I know how good
and sensitive you are.

1223
01:13:47,056 --> 01:13:48,958
You're lying.

1224
01:13:51,127 --> 01:13:53,496
I'm just like him!

1225
01:13:53,529 --> 01:13:54,063
Sebastian!

1226
01:13:54,096 --> 01:13:56,032
Sebastian?

1227
01:13:56,065 --> 01:13:57,767
S- Sebastian,

1228
01:13:57,800 --> 01:13:59,535
how could you
be just like anybody

1229
01:13:59,568 --> 01:14:02,605
when you're more yourself
than anyone else I know?

1230
01:14:04,273 --> 01:14:06,542
You're- you're not your father.

1231
01:14:07,243 --> 01:14:08,144
[gasps]

1232
01:14:08,177 --> 01:14:09,845
You're everything.

1233
01:14:12,081 --> 01:14:14,083
You're everything, Sebastian.

1234
01:14:21,624 --> 01:14:22,992
-Wait.
-What?

1235
01:14:23,025 --> 01:14:24,794
You're right.
Let's do this.

1236
01:14:24,827 --> 01:14:26,295
It's you and me.

1237
01:14:26,329 --> 01:14:27,530
Come on,
let's go away together.

1238
01:14:27,563 --> 01:14:29,031
Se- Sebastian.

1239
01:14:29,065 --> 01:14:30,966
It's not like that.

1240
01:14:33,903 --> 01:14:35,571
You really love him.

1241
01:14:36,839 --> 01:14:38,274
What the fuck
is your problem, man?

1242
01:14:38,307 --> 01:14:39,709
Tim! Stop!

1243
01:14:39,742 --> 01:14:40,643
-Hey-hey-hey-hey!
-No!

1244
01:14:40,676 --> 01:14:41,277
You spoiled fucking child!

1245
01:14:41,310 --> 01:14:42,078
He didn't mean it!

1246
01:14:42,111 --> 01:14:42,945
What?
You took everyone's money,

1247
01:14:42,978 --> 01:14:44,647
and now you want
their boyfriends, too?

1248
01:14:44,680 --> 01:14:45,681
Stop!

1249
01:14:48,617 --> 01:14:49,985
Come on, man.

1250
01:14:50,019 --> 01:14:51,287
It's okay.

1251
01:14:51,320 --> 01:14:52,722
Come on, hit me.

1252
01:14:53,923 --> 01:14:56,292
Hit me.
I deserve it.

1253
01:14:59,095 --> 01:15:00,796
[sighs]

1254
01:15:01,831 --> 01:15:03,065
I'm sorry. Let's go.

1255
01:15:03,099 --> 01:15:04,734
Are you crazy?

1256
01:15:04,767 --> 01:15:05,835
Pushing him like that?

1257
01:15:05,868 --> 01:15:06,535
You're taking his side?

1258
01:15:06,569 --> 01:15:09,004
I'm not taking anyone's side.

1259
01:15:09,038 --> 01:15:10,306
[breathing heavily]

1260
01:15:12,742 --> 01:15:14,343
You're always gonna choose
him over me, aren't you?

1261
01:15:14,377 --> 01:15:15,211
No, Tim. I love you,

1262
01:15:15,244 --> 01:15:17,279
-but you can't--
-He's a terrible person.

1263
01:15:22,952 --> 01:15:24,854
I'm sorry, I'm done.

1264
01:15:26,989 --> 01:15:28,290
I just don't belong here.

1265
01:15:31,360 --> 01:15:32,628
No, take him!

1266
01:15:32,828 --> 01:15:33,562
Go.

1267
01:15:33,596 --> 01:15:35,030
-He's right.
-I'm not leaving.

1268
01:15:35,064 --> 01:15:35,931
-Go, go.
-Stop!

1269
01:15:35,965 --> 01:15:36,632
Go!
Get out of here!

1270
01:15:36,665 --> 01:15:37,333
Sebastian, stop!

1271
01:15:37,366 --> 01:15:39,702
Go! Oh!
All of you - Go!

1272
01:15:40,236 --> 01:15:41,270
Sebastian, it's okay.

1273
01:15:41,370 --> 01:15:42,171
Sebastian.

1274
01:15:42,204 --> 01:15:43,739
You-- You weak,
fucking faggot, go!

1275
01:15:43,773 --> 01:15:45,608
I don't need you here!

1276
01:15:46,308 --> 01:15:48,010
(Charlie) Stop.
-Go!

1277
01:15:48,944 --> 01:15:50,279
(Charlie) Stop.

1278
01:15:50,880 --> 01:15:52,081
[whispers]
Stop.

1279
01:15:54,216 --> 01:15:55,885
[sighs]
It's okay, alright.

1280
01:16:34,290 --> 01:16:35,391
[knocks]

1281
01:16:38,461 --> 01:16:40,362
My baby boy.

1282
01:16:41,831 --> 01:16:43,065
[chuckles softly]

1283
01:16:47,470 --> 01:16:48,737
[sighs]

1284
01:16:52,908 --> 01:16:54,677
How is he?

1285
01:16:54,710 --> 01:16:56,312
Mmm.

1286
01:16:56,345 --> 01:16:58,414
He's still asleep.

1287
01:16:58,447 --> 01:16:59,782
Poor thing.

1288
01:17:01,450 --> 01:17:06,889
How does it feel
being in your old room?

1289
01:17:06,922 --> 01:17:08,724
Different.

1290
01:17:09,792 --> 01:17:11,427
So, you were gonna
move to San Francisco

1291
01:17:11,460 --> 01:17:13,128
without telling your mother?

1292
01:17:15,097 --> 01:17:16,298
Sorry.

1293
01:17:17,967 --> 01:17:20,669
Well, I'm not
moving anymore, so...

1294
01:17:25,908 --> 01:17:28,143
When did you
become such a man?

1295
01:17:29,745 --> 01:17:31,280
Don't feel like one.

1296
01:17:33,115 --> 01:17:34,116
Hmm?

1297
01:17:34,149 --> 01:17:38,687
You know, with Tim,
I- I thought I was, but--

1298
01:17:39,522 --> 01:17:40,589
Hmm.

1299
01:17:40,623 --> 01:17:43,192
Maybe you need to figure
that out on your own first.

1300
01:17:47,129 --> 01:17:48,430
Yeah.

1301
01:17:50,266 --> 01:17:53,002
He texted me saying
he's leaving tomorrow

1302
01:17:53,035 --> 01:17:54,503
for fucking San Francisco.

1303
01:17:54,537 --> 01:17:56,839
Honey, please
don't use the F word.

1304
01:17:57,806 --> 01:17:59,008
Sorry.

1305
01:17:59,875 --> 01:18:02,211
Well, maybe it was
just meant to end this way.

1306
01:18:03,512 --> 01:18:05,080
Are you gonna say goodbye?

1307
01:18:06,048 --> 01:18:08,484
No, I don't think he wants
to talk to me right now.

1308
01:18:11,420 --> 01:18:12,821
[sighs]

1309
01:18:13,055 --> 01:18:14,189
Charles...

1310
01:18:16,959 --> 01:18:18,027
get up. Come on.

1311
01:18:18,494 --> 01:18:19,862
Why?

1312
01:18:19,895 --> 01:18:21,830
Don't leave things
on a bad note.

1313
01:18:24,567 --> 01:18:25,935
Charles,

1314
01:18:28,404 --> 01:18:30,039
real men say goodbye.

1315
01:18:41,817 --> 01:18:45,854
?

1316
01:18:58,934 --> 01:19:00,502
[buzzes door]

1317
01:19:07,943 --> 01:19:09,278
[buzzes door]

1318
01:19:34,103 --> 01:19:35,337
Hey.

1319
01:19:36,438 --> 01:19:38,440
Mmm, hey.

1320
01:19:39,908 --> 01:19:42,044
Mmm, hey.

1321
01:19:46,248 --> 01:19:47,883
I'm sorry.

1322
01:19:51,186 --> 01:19:52,521
I'm sorry, too.

1323
01:19:55,024 --> 01:19:56,825
I want you to be happy.

1324
01:19:58,627 --> 01:20:00,095
Me, too.

1325
01:20:05,167 --> 01:20:07,336
(Sebastian) I don't think
that I can be happy here.

1326
01:20:09,171 --> 01:20:10,339
(Charlie) I know.

1327
01:20:13,008 --> 01:20:15,944
Anyway, I've got
an apology gift for you.

1328
01:20:18,113 --> 01:20:19,882
One time only.

1329
01:20:21,617 --> 01:20:23,152
What?

1330
01:20:41,603 --> 01:20:44,506
[Charlie's voice breaks]
How did you--

1331
01:20:44,540 --> 01:20:47,609
-I went to your house.
-Sebastian called me.

1332
01:20:48,677 --> 01:20:50,045
Sebastian?

1333
01:20:51,447 --> 01:20:53,482
You've got a good friend there.

1334
01:20:58,220 --> 01:21:00,189
-I'm not--
-I know.

1335
01:21:12,334 --> 01:21:14,002
[sighs]

1336
01:21:16,105 --> 01:21:17,506
Please.

1337
01:21:18,540 --> 01:21:20,442
You can't go.
I love you.

1338
01:21:20,476 --> 01:21:22,177
[takes a shuddering breath]

1339
01:21:28,584 --> 01:21:30,519
It's just not our time.

1340
01:21:33,722 --> 01:21:35,090
Yeah.

1341
01:21:45,400 --> 01:21:46,969
[sighs]

1342
01:21:55,677 --> 01:21:59,281
?

1343
01:23:03,212 --> 01:23:04,813
Members of the jury,

1344
01:23:04,847 --> 01:23:08,417
we are gathered here today

1345
01:23:08,450 --> 01:23:11,453
to investigate the crimes

1346
01:23:11,486 --> 01:23:14,323
of the dangerous war criminal...

1347
01:23:14,356 --> 01:23:14,923
Ooh.

1348
01:23:14,957 --> 01:23:16,158
Sebastian Blackworth.

1349
01:23:18,427 --> 01:23:21,029
Even though
he is leaving us,

1350
01:23:21,830 --> 01:23:23,432
no matter where he goes,

1351
01:23:25,133 --> 01:23:29,071
no matter what
name he goes by,

1352
01:23:31,240 --> 01:23:33,642
no matter what
people say about him,

1353
01:23:36,812 --> 01:23:39,414
I sentence him

1354
01:23:39,848 --> 01:23:43,719
to always be a one-eyed
freak like the rest of us.

1355
01:23:47,289 --> 01:23:48,390
Amen.

1356
01:23:48,423 --> 01:23:50,092
Wait.

1357
01:23:50,192 --> 01:23:51,426
Uh,
[clears throat]

1358
01:23:51,460 --> 01:23:52,628
Your Honor,

1359
01:23:52,861 --> 01:23:55,364
if I may have one final word

1360
01:23:55,397 --> 01:23:57,633
before my sentencing
commences--

1361
01:23:57,666 --> 01:23:59,368
If you must.

1362
01:24:04,740 --> 01:24:06,074
[sighs]

1363
01:24:06,875 --> 01:24:09,611
The thing is,
I was wrong about you.

1364
01:24:11,480 --> 01:24:13,515
You don't just
face our good sides.

1365
01:24:14,716 --> 01:24:15,817
No...

1366
01:24:18,320 --> 01:24:21,189
you stare right at our one eye,

1367
01:24:21,456 --> 01:24:23,558
and you find
the beauty in it anyway.

1368
01:24:26,428 --> 01:24:30,899
Thank you for always
seeing the best in people,

1369
01:24:30,933 --> 01:24:33,568
even when they can't
see it themselves.

1370
01:24:39,508 --> 01:24:40,842
To Charles.

1371
01:24:42,244 --> 01:24:43,312
To us.

1372
01:24:43,345 --> 01:24:44,646
[glasses/bottles clink]

1373
01:24:44,680 --> 01:24:46,682
[clears throat]

1374
01:24:51,720 --> 01:24:54,690
?
