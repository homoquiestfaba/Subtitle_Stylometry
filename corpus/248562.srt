1
00:00:46,746 --> 00:00:50,443
Get out of my way,
you damn lazy dog.

2
00:00:54,888 --> 00:00:56,685
Here.

3
00:00:56,756 --> 00:01:01,022
No good
worthless old mutt.

4
00:01:35,895 --> 00:01:39,456
Get out of my way,
you damn critters.

5
00:01:43,736 --> 00:01:44,964
Here.

6
00:01:52,946 --> 00:01:54,675
Here.

7
00:01:54,747 --> 00:01:56,374
Worthless buzzards.

8
00:03:47,193 --> 00:03:48,751
Coffee went up,

9
00:03:48,828 --> 00:03:53,128
I had to short you
some canned goods
to keep 'em at 20.

10
00:03:55,802 --> 00:03:57,201
Is that a problem?

11
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:02,601
Take it or leave it.

12
00:04:09,582 --> 00:04:12,710
Your friend find you?

13
00:04:12,785 --> 00:04:13,774
What?

14
00:04:13,853 --> 00:04:15,286
There was a guy here
this morning

15
00:04:15,355 --> 00:04:16,344
looking for you.

16
00:04:16,422 --> 00:04:17,821
Said he was
your friend.

17
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:46,574
Daddy, look what I found.

18
00:05:48,147 --> 00:05:49,808
What is it, honey?

19
00:05:49,882 --> 00:05:51,577
Hey!
Hold it right there!

20
00:05:51,651 --> 00:05:53,881
Easy, cowboy, easy.

21
00:05:53,953 --> 00:05:57,514
Who are you
and what do you want?

22
00:05:57,590 --> 00:06:01,151
Lieutenant?
Oh, it is you,

23
00:06:01,227 --> 00:06:05,129
you no good
son of a bitch.

24
00:06:05,198 --> 00:06:07,496
Private Henry R. Hocknell Jr.,
reporting sir!

25
00:06:08,935 --> 00:06:10,197
Don't salute.

26
00:06:13,306 --> 00:06:16,070
Come on,
don't pretend
you don't remember!

27
00:06:16,142 --> 00:06:20,704
Baby killing warmonger!

28
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:22,179
Hocknell?

29
00:06:22,248 --> 00:06:23,374
You bet your red ass!

30
00:06:23,449 --> 00:06:24,438
Daddy!

31
00:06:24,517 --> 00:06:25,643
Vietnam in '67.

32
00:06:25,718 --> 00:06:28,050
Come here,
it's okay, it's okay.

33
00:06:28,121 --> 00:06:31,284
It's all right,
it's all right.

34
00:06:33,693 --> 00:06:36,321
My God!

35
00:06:36,396 --> 00:06:37,920
Henry!

36
00:06:37,997 --> 00:06:43,025
Yeah!
Come here!

37
00:06:43,102 --> 00:06:44,330
Hey, how did you
find me?

38
00:06:44,404 --> 00:06:45,598
Well, it wasn't easy.

39
00:06:45,671 --> 00:06:48,799
Nothing short
of a goddamn miracle,
it was.

40
00:06:48,875 --> 00:06:53,403
This is Lee,
it's my kid.

41
00:06:53,479 --> 00:06:57,973
I call her Lenny.
Lenny, this ugly bastard
is Jake.

42
00:07:01,387 --> 00:07:03,878
Eggs aren't collected
till the end of the day.

43
00:07:06,159 --> 00:07:08,024
It's okay, it's okay.

44
00:07:08,094 --> 00:07:10,562
Oh, he just looks scary.

45
00:07:18,204 --> 00:07:23,232
Oh yeah, you got
a little slice
of heaven here, Lieutenant.

46
00:07:23,309 --> 00:07:25,277
Yeah.

47
00:07:28,314 --> 00:07:30,578
Your kid, huh?

48
00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:35,053
Yeah, ended up
marrying me a gook.

49
00:07:35,121 --> 00:07:38,284
Well, me and women
never got along too well.

50
00:07:38,357 --> 00:07:40,052
Been there myself.

51
00:07:40,126 --> 00:07:42,060
So where's your wife?

52
00:07:42,128 --> 00:07:44,619
Uh, she died.

53
00:07:44,697 --> 00:07:45,959
Sorry.

54
00:07:46,032 --> 00:07:51,766
Yeah, well, me too.

55
00:07:51,838 --> 00:07:54,238
You still got that thing?

56
00:07:54,307 --> 00:07:56,605
Forgot all about it.

57
00:07:56,676 --> 00:07:59,668
Oh yeah.

58
00:07:59,745 --> 00:08:05,775
Well, my dad gave it to me
on his freaking death bed.

59
00:08:05,852 --> 00:08:09,811
Said it was leading me
to where I was meant
to go.

60
00:08:12,024 --> 00:08:14,322
Guess it did.

61
00:08:26,439 --> 00:08:28,168
Hey!

62
00:08:28,241 --> 00:08:29,799
Don't do that.

63
00:08:34,714 --> 00:08:36,909
You been
to the Wall, Jake?

64
00:08:36,983 --> 00:08:38,109
No.

65
00:08:38,184 --> 00:08:40,709
You couldn't drag me there.

66
00:08:40,786 --> 00:08:43,118
Yeah, well I...

67
00:08:43,189 --> 00:08:46,647
I never thought I'd go
but I'm glad I did.

68
00:08:47,727 --> 00:08:48,716
You went?

69
00:08:48,794 --> 00:08:50,557
Yeah,

70
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:52,461
I went in the middle
of the night,

71
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:55,990
just me and a. 38,
I was gonna blow
my freaking brains out.

72
00:08:57,069 --> 00:08:58,058
Yeah.

73
00:08:58,137 --> 00:09:00,128
A final F-you
to Uncle Sam,

74
00:09:00,206 --> 00:09:03,505
you know what I mean?

75
00:09:03,576 --> 00:09:07,478
And then I looked
at all them freakin' names,

76
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:11,244
and all those people that had
their lives stole from them,

77
00:09:11,317 --> 00:09:14,411
they didn't have
no goddamn choice.

78
00:09:15,154 --> 00:09:16,587
But I did.

79
00:09:16,656 --> 00:09:18,624
All I could think of
was me sitting there

80
00:09:18,691 --> 00:09:22,627
drowning in self-pity,
some pathetic piece of shit.

81
00:09:23,996 --> 00:09:25,190
So what'd you do?

82
00:09:26,132 --> 00:09:27,929
I couldn't do it,

83
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,194
I couldn't do it
to them.

84
00:09:30,636 --> 00:09:33,662
So, I ended up
going back to Nam,

85
00:09:33,739 --> 00:09:37,106
to try to find
whatever the hell it was
I lost over there.

86
00:09:39,645 --> 00:09:44,912
So, you see, Jake,
if I'd never gone to the Wall,
I'd never had Lenny.

87
00:09:46,152 --> 00:09:48,279
If you came here
on some mission,

88
00:09:48,354 --> 00:09:51,118
preaching me about the Wall,
you're wasting your time.

89
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:52,521
No, no, I...

90
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:55,060
that's not why
I came.

91
00:09:55,127 --> 00:09:56,116
Why did you?

92
00:09:58,864 --> 00:10:01,799
You know, I always wanted
to take Lenny to the Wall.

93
00:10:01,867 --> 00:10:03,129
Yeah, so take her.

94
00:10:03,202 --> 00:10:04,692
Nah, I can't.

95
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:07,238
What's stopping you?

96
00:10:07,306 --> 00:10:09,536
Lung cancer.

97
00:10:11,944 --> 00:10:13,434
Oh, Christ!

98
00:10:13,512 --> 00:10:14,843
Yeah!

99
00:10:14,914 --> 00:10:17,849
It's that Asian orange shit.

100
00:10:17,917 --> 00:10:21,546
Yeah, go figure
all that goddamn crap
I've been through,

101
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:27,560
some goddamn weed killer
from 30 years ago
is trying to kick my ass.

102
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:30,596
Yeah, I've got to see
some specialist back East,

103
00:10:30,663 --> 00:10:33,325
and it's gonna be
pretty rough.

104
00:10:33,399 --> 00:10:38,632
We all gotta take a dirt nap
sooner or later, don't we?

105
00:10:45,544 --> 00:10:46,738
Oh no.

106
00:10:46,812 --> 00:10:48,746
You're the only guy
I can trust, Jake.

107
00:10:48,814 --> 00:10:51,044
Absolutely not.

108
00:10:51,117 --> 00:10:54,018
Hey, it's just
for a little while,
you know what I mean?

109
00:10:54,086 --> 00:10:56,145
She could help
around the place here,

110
00:10:56,222 --> 00:10:58,156
No!

111
00:10:58,224 --> 00:11:01,682
Come on, Jake,
you took care of me.

112
00:11:01,761 --> 00:11:04,195
You always took care
of all of your men!

113
00:11:05,331 --> 00:11:07,231
No I didn't.

114
00:11:07,299 --> 00:11:09,824
She's all I've got
in the world, Jake.

115
00:11:09,902 --> 00:11:12,632
And... and
I'm all she's got...

116
00:11:12,705 --> 00:11:16,801
Forget about it, Henry.
It ain't gonna happen.

117
00:11:25,618 --> 00:11:27,176
You all squared away, honey?

118
00:11:29,121 --> 00:11:31,089
Good, I'll be right in.

119
00:11:43,369 --> 00:11:46,634
You're nice and warm in there,
my little princess.

120
00:11:46,706 --> 00:11:48,139
Yeah.

121
00:11:48,207 --> 00:11:51,802
Good, good.

122
00:11:51,877 --> 00:11:54,539
Uh, you brush your teeth,
did you?

123
00:11:57,616 --> 00:12:00,881
Wash your face and hands
hm? Everything?

124
00:12:03,656 --> 00:12:07,717
You, uh, got your clothes
all set up for tomorrow?

125
00:12:07,793 --> 00:12:08,782
M m-hmm.

126
00:12:08,861 --> 00:12:10,692
Yeah?

127
00:12:10,763 --> 00:12:12,594
I'm okay.

128
00:12:14,166 --> 00:12:16,361
Oh, I know you are.

129
00:12:20,039 --> 00:12:21,131
You know,

130
00:12:22,274 --> 00:12:24,868
I love you very much.

131
00:12:32,351 --> 00:12:35,946
Now, you know
what you gotta do, right?

132
00:12:36,021 --> 00:12:37,147
M m-hmm.

133
00:12:37,223 --> 00:12:39,157
I know you're gonna do
a good job.

134
00:12:39,225 --> 00:12:40,214
I know you will.

135
00:12:40,292 --> 00:12:41,316
Yeah.

136
00:12:42,394 --> 00:12:44,555
You're gonna make me
very proud.

137
00:12:53,739 --> 00:12:55,104
Okay, Lenny.

138
00:12:55,174 --> 00:12:58,735
Okay, now.
Okay, Lenny.

139
00:12:58,811 --> 00:13:03,180
Now you be strong,
be real strong, all right?

140
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:15,822
You know,

141
00:13:15,895 --> 00:13:18,090
there's not a better man alive
than Jake.

142
00:13:20,766 --> 00:13:23,792
And you can trust me
on that.

143
00:13:27,673 --> 00:13:28,765
You can.

144
00:13:38,184 --> 00:13:41,381
Look at those cute
little kids, man.

145
00:13:41,453 --> 00:13:46,914
A girl, that's all
the wife and I
ever talk about.

146
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:50,028
A cute little girl.

147
00:14:05,578 --> 00:14:06,670
Good night, honey.

148
00:14:06,745 --> 00:14:11,580
Good night, Daddy.

149
00:14:11,650 --> 00:14:13,550
Hey, Lenny?

150
00:14:13,619 --> 00:14:17,419
I want you to say
"Good night"
to mean old Jake here.

151
00:14:19,091 --> 00:14:23,084
' Night, Lieutenant
M r. Mean Old Jake.

152
00:14:54,827 --> 00:14:56,351
Your dad
in the shed..?

153
00:14:56,428 --> 00:14:58,988
Your dad
in the outhouse?

154
00:15:02,601 --> 00:15:05,229
Did you hear me?

155
00:15:08,707 --> 00:15:09,696
What's the matter?

156
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:16,441
I gotta go find
your dad.

157
00:15:24,757 --> 00:15:26,019
Hen...

158
00:15:33,032 --> 00:15:35,466
Hey... shit!

159
00:15:41,273 --> 00:15:43,104
Henry!!

160
00:15:46,478 --> 00:15:47,467
Ow!

161
00:15:50,716 --> 00:15:52,445
Henry!

162
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:55,809
Where is he?!

163
00:15:55,888 --> 00:15:57,321
He's gone!

164
00:15:57,389 --> 00:15:58,720
What do you mean
he's gone?

165
00:15:58,791 --> 00:16:00,884
He left me here!

166
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,894
He left me here
with you!

167
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:06,125
I... I...
when did he leave?

168
00:16:26,919 --> 00:16:28,853
Oh, Christ!

169
00:16:31,290 --> 00:16:32,279
Let's go!

170
00:16:35,461 --> 00:16:39,795
No!

171
00:16:39,865 --> 00:16:42,459
Too bad!

172
00:16:43,602 --> 00:16:45,069
What hospital
is he going to?

173
00:16:45,137 --> 00:16:46,229
I don't know!

174
00:16:46,305 --> 00:16:47,966
Goddamn it to hell!

175
00:16:49,708 --> 00:16:51,608
Stop it!

176
00:16:53,178 --> 00:16:54,941
Ice cream,
you want some ice cream?

177
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:56,174
No!

178
00:16:56,248 --> 00:16:58,341
What about one of them
cheeseburger things?

179
00:16:58,417 --> 00:16:59,475
No!

180
00:16:59,551 --> 00:17:01,314
This is a damn sheer waste
of my time.

181
00:17:01,387 --> 00:17:02,786
Hey, what are you doing?!

182
00:17:02,855 --> 00:17:04,982
I'm leaving!
And you can't stop me!

183
00:17:05,057 --> 00:17:08,390
Hey! Hey!
Wait! Hey, stop!
Hey, hey!

184
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:10,621
Hey!!
Hey!!

185
00:17:13,232 --> 00:17:15,632
Hey!

186
00:17:15,701 --> 00:17:16,929
I'm not going!

187
00:17:17,002 --> 00:17:18,993
No wonder your dad
left you!

188
00:17:19,071 --> 00:17:21,869
No wonder
your wife left you!

189
00:17:21,940 --> 00:17:24,340
How did you..!

190
00:17:24,410 --> 00:17:25,638
Why you little..!

191
00:17:25,711 --> 00:17:27,872
Let go!

192
00:17:30,449 --> 00:17:33,145
Let me go!

193
00:17:40,259 --> 00:17:42,056
The truth is

194
00:17:42,127 --> 00:17:45,756
she left me 'cause she wanted
a bunch of pain-in-the-ass kids
like you

195
00:17:45,831 --> 00:17:47,162
and I didn't!

196
00:17:47,232 --> 00:17:49,166
I don't like you!

197
00:17:49,234 --> 00:17:51,327
And so what?

198
00:17:51,403 --> 00:17:53,530
I don't like me either.

199
00:18:07,586 --> 00:18:08,746
Get, get on.

200
00:18:08,821 --> 00:18:11,221
Now I have to wait.
Get!

201
00:18:23,669 --> 00:18:29,301
You better fix yourself
something to eat.

202
00:18:29,374 --> 00:18:34,277
When your dad comes back
and you're dead
because you ain't ate nothin'

203
00:18:34,346 --> 00:18:36,780
it ain't my fault.

204
00:18:36,849 --> 00:18:39,579
I can't cook.

205
00:18:39,651 --> 00:18:42,518
Henry says
you can cook!

206
00:18:42,588 --> 00:18:43,612
Only a little.

207
00:18:45,691 --> 00:18:46,680
Jello.

208
00:18:48,427 --> 00:18:53,228
Well, if you can find
the chicken that lays
the Jello egg,

209
00:18:53,298 --> 00:18:55,960
you can cook it.

210
00:18:56,034 --> 00:18:57,524
You yelled at me.

211
00:18:57,603 --> 00:18:59,093
Get used to it!

212
00:19:32,905 --> 00:19:34,896
Lieutenant.

213
00:19:34,973 --> 00:19:37,407
Those kids,
what if something happened
to them,

214
00:19:37,476 --> 00:19:38,465
in the line of fire?

215
00:19:38,544 --> 00:19:40,375
Shoot 'em all,
cherry boy.

216
00:19:40,445 --> 00:19:42,140
They're gooks
and they're gooks.

217
00:19:42,214 --> 00:19:43,203
What?

218
00:19:43,282 --> 00:19:44,647
Ain't no big thing.

219
00:19:44,716 --> 00:19:47,549
Go to hell.
Lieutenant, I've got
a bad feeling...

220
00:19:47,619 --> 00:19:48,847
Get over it.

221
00:19:49,388 --> 00:19:50,377
Sir...

222
00:19:50,455 --> 00:19:51,786
Don't be
a pussy, Gardner.

223
00:19:51,857 --> 00:19:52,846
Sir, we can't do this!

224
00:19:52,925 --> 00:19:53,914
Shut up!

225
00:19:56,728 --> 00:19:58,662
Let's rock'n'roll!

226
00:20:41,173 --> 00:20:43,471
There aren't
any seat belts.

227
00:20:43,542 --> 00:20:44,531
Any what?

228
00:20:44,610 --> 00:20:46,771
Seat belts.

229
00:20:46,845 --> 00:20:48,437
We have to have
seat belts.

230
00:20:50,949 --> 00:20:53,782
We don't need
no damn seat belts.

231
00:21:15,374 --> 00:21:16,363
Where we going?

232
00:21:16,441 --> 00:21:18,238
Never you mind.

233
00:21:21,647 --> 00:21:22,807
Yes, hello?

234
00:21:22,881 --> 00:21:24,542
<i>The number you have reached</i>

235
00:21:24,616 --> 00:21:25,947
<i>is not in service.</i>

236
00:21:26,018 --> 00:21:28,282
<i>Please check the number</i>
<i>or try your call again.</i>

237
00:21:28,353 --> 00:21:29,342
Damn it!

238
00:21:29,988 --> 00:21:32,650
Damn it!

239
00:21:32,724 --> 00:21:37,161
And damn you Henry!!

240
00:21:46,038 --> 00:21:48,632
You shouldn't wander off
too far by yourself.

241
00:21:48,707 --> 00:21:51,540
There's mean-ass neighbors
that hates kids.

242
00:21:51,610 --> 00:21:53,100
They eat 'em whole.

243
00:21:53,178 --> 00:21:56,614
Swallow 'em up
in one bite, they do.

244
00:21:58,150 --> 00:22:00,380
It's time for you
to start earning your keep.

245
00:22:00,452 --> 00:22:03,785
Get some feed
and feed the critters.

246
00:22:24,042 --> 00:22:26,533
For Christ's sake.

247
00:22:38,590 --> 00:22:39,682
Never mind.

248
00:23:37,382 --> 00:23:39,407
Give me that!

249
00:23:42,287 --> 00:23:44,346
Leave my stuff alone!

250
00:24:01,006 --> 00:24:03,304
Go away!

251
00:24:32,337 --> 00:24:35,204
Well, who's this little angel?

252
00:24:35,273 --> 00:24:38,674
Her name is Lenny,
she be going any day now.

253
00:24:38,743 --> 00:24:41,837
Hi, Lenny.

254
00:24:41,913 --> 00:24:43,938
My name is Kate.

255
00:24:44,015 --> 00:24:45,949
You got my supplies?

256
00:24:46,017 --> 00:24:47,314
Where you from, Lenny?

257
00:24:47,385 --> 00:24:48,716
We gotta get going.

258
00:24:48,787 --> 00:24:49,776
Would you mind?

259
00:24:52,624 --> 00:24:54,455
Uh...

260
00:24:54,526 --> 00:24:56,289
Can I get something
to eat now?

261
00:24:56,361 --> 00:24:58,955
Hell no, you shoulda eaten
at the house.

262
00:25:00,765 --> 00:25:03,893
You just help yourself
to anything you want.

263
00:25:03,969 --> 00:25:05,231
It's on the house.

264
00:25:05,303 --> 00:25:07,032
You shoulda asked
me first.

265
00:25:07,105 --> 00:25:08,936
Ask you?
What?

266
00:25:09,007 --> 00:25:11,874
You mean have a real
honest-to-God conversation?

267
00:25:11,943 --> 00:25:13,535
Ask you, my ass.

268
00:25:24,389 --> 00:25:26,357
No, not enough.

269
00:25:26,424 --> 00:25:29,552
It's been getting tougher
to fill your order
for 20 bucks a box.

270
00:25:29,628 --> 00:25:30,822
$25?

271
00:25:30,896 --> 00:25:32,158
Done.

272
00:25:32,831 --> 00:25:33,820
Next time.

273
00:25:38,570 --> 00:25:40,765
Is there change
for a phone call?

274
00:25:46,444 --> 00:25:47,433
This good?

275
00:25:47,512 --> 00:25:48,809
Sure.

276
00:25:50,115 --> 00:25:52,015
Here, here.

277
00:25:55,086 --> 00:25:56,576
There you go.

278
00:25:56,655 --> 00:25:57,644
Thanks.

279
00:26:01,626 --> 00:26:04,891
So Lenny,
where are your parents?

280
00:26:06,464 --> 00:26:08,364
My mom's in heaven,

281
00:26:10,268 --> 00:26:13,795
my dad...

282
00:26:13,872 --> 00:26:14,964
left.

283
00:26:18,977 --> 00:26:19,966
Oh.

284
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:24,114
You know people
in heaven too, don't you?

285
00:26:33,959 --> 00:26:35,085
Yes, I do.

286
00:26:36,828 --> 00:26:40,457
They love you even more
when they get to heaven,
you know.

287
00:26:40,532 --> 00:26:42,500
No matter what.

288
00:26:52,477 --> 00:26:54,468
Come on, let's go.

289
00:26:58,350 --> 00:27:00,910
That was nice.

290
00:27:00,986 --> 00:27:03,477
If you say so.

291
00:27:08,593 --> 00:27:11,027
You better put on
your rain gear.

292
00:27:11,096 --> 00:27:12,085
What?

293
00:27:12,163 --> 00:27:14,028
Your coat,
put it on.

294
00:27:14,099 --> 00:27:15,361
I don't have one.

295
00:27:16,301 --> 00:27:17,791
What?

296
00:27:17,869 --> 00:27:20,997
What have you got
in that damn bag?

297
00:27:21,072 --> 00:27:22,937
Crayons,

298
00:27:23,008 --> 00:27:24,703
a coloring book,

299
00:27:24,776 --> 00:27:26,141
and a doll.

300
00:27:26,211 --> 00:27:29,476
Damn it!
You should have brought
some rain gear!

301
00:27:30,849 --> 00:27:31,941
You're yelling at me.

302
00:27:32,017 --> 00:27:33,450
You're damn right I am!

303
00:27:33,518 --> 00:27:35,748
You're gonna catch
a death of a cold out here!

304
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:36,809
Sorry.

305
00:27:38,223 --> 00:27:40,555
Never go into these woods

306
00:27:40,625 --> 00:27:43,321
without at least
taking a jacket!

307
00:27:43,395 --> 00:27:45,022
Okay.

308
00:27:46,798 --> 00:27:49,824
Maybe next time
you'll tell me
where we're going.

309
00:28:03,948 --> 00:28:06,109
What's that for?

310
00:28:06,184 --> 00:28:08,516
I'm helping some friends.

311
00:28:08,586 --> 00:28:10,053
What's their names?

312
00:28:11,723 --> 00:28:12,917
Don't know.

313
00:28:12,991 --> 00:28:15,050
You don't know
your friends' names?

314
00:28:16,795 --> 00:28:18,194
No.

315
00:28:21,166 --> 00:28:23,566
Well, then how do you know
they're your friends?

316
00:28:23,635 --> 00:28:26,001
Some things
you just know.

317
00:28:26,071 --> 00:28:27,902
Come on.

318
00:28:29,708 --> 00:28:31,699
Help me load this wood.

319
00:28:38,016 --> 00:28:40,678
Well, where do they live?

320
00:28:40,752 --> 00:28:44,882
Out here,
in the woods.

321
00:28:44,956 --> 00:28:47,049
How'd you meet 'em?

322
00:28:47,125 --> 00:28:48,251
Never met 'em.

323
00:28:48,326 --> 00:28:50,920
Just heard they were
living out here,

324
00:28:50,995 --> 00:28:54,761
so one day,
I decided to leave them
a surprise.

325
00:28:54,833 --> 00:28:55,993
How come?

326
00:28:56,067 --> 00:28:58,501
I just thought maybe
it'd be good

327
00:28:58,570 --> 00:29:01,437
that they know
somebody cared about 'em,

328
00:29:01,506 --> 00:29:03,133
and was thinking
about ‘em.

329
00:29:03,208 --> 00:29:07,872
Next thing I knew,
they were leaving
wood in return.

330
00:29:10,348 --> 00:29:15,217
Well, how come
they live in the woods?

331
00:29:15,286 --> 00:29:18,847
Some people just like
living by themselves.

332
00:29:21,292 --> 00:29:22,281
Why?

333
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:25,454
Because they just do!

334
00:29:42,714 --> 00:29:44,875
You stay in the truck
and stop talkin',

335
00:29:44,949 --> 00:29:47,679
you're wearing
my ears out.

336
00:30:20,852 --> 00:30:23,878
Can I get out here?

337
00:30:23,955 --> 00:30:26,014
I suppose.

338
00:30:27,358 --> 00:30:30,327
Cool, a cave!

339
00:30:30,395 --> 00:30:32,022
Hey, not exactly.

340
00:30:32,096 --> 00:30:33,563
Old mining tunnel.

341
00:30:33,631 --> 00:30:37,032
Come on, we'll take
some of this wood
back to the truck.

342
00:30:39,003 --> 00:30:39,992
Can I go inside it?

343
00:30:40,071 --> 00:30:41,163
No!

344
00:30:46,544 --> 00:30:49,445
Watch out.
Come on,
I'm freezing.

345
00:31:10,268 --> 00:31:13,931
What's wrong, Jake?

346
00:31:14,005 --> 00:31:15,472
Nothing.

347
00:32:40,692 --> 00:32:44,788
Shoo, shoo!
Here, git! Git!

348
00:32:53,838 --> 00:32:57,831
If you're not eating,
I'm not eating.

349
00:33:17,495 --> 00:33:21,022
Does...

350
00:33:21,099 --> 00:33:23,226
blue go with orange?

351
00:33:30,108 --> 00:33:33,236
I'm not so good
with colors.

352
00:34:25,763 --> 00:34:27,924
Sorry for yelling.

353
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:30,558
Okay.

354
00:34:35,006 --> 00:34:40,308
Sorry for... for throwing things
at you.

355
00:34:40,378 --> 00:34:45,372
And for going
through your stuff.

356
00:34:45,450 --> 00:34:49,819
And for not having
any rain gear.

357
00:34:49,887 --> 00:34:51,479
And for making
a mess of...

358
00:34:51,556 --> 00:34:52,545
Stop.

359
00:34:53,891 --> 00:34:55,950
Stop while you're ahead.

360
00:34:57,528 --> 00:34:58,586
Okay.

361
00:35:07,438 --> 00:35:09,338
What's the cat's name?

362
00:35:09,407 --> 00:35:10,396
Cat.

363
00:35:12,176 --> 00:35:13,871
Cat.

364
00:35:13,945 --> 00:35:15,344
Just Cat?

365
00:35:15,413 --> 00:35:16,402
Yup.

366
00:35:19,951 --> 00:35:21,418
What's the dog's name?

367
00:35:22,954 --> 00:35:23,943
Dog.

368
00:35:25,456 --> 00:35:26,753
Oh.

369
00:35:30,728 --> 00:35:33,288
What do you call
the chickens?

370
00:35:33,364 --> 00:35:34,524
Chickens?

371
00:35:34,599 --> 00:35:35,588
No.

372
00:35:36,667 --> 00:35:37,929
Ladies.

373
00:35:41,172 --> 00:35:42,469
Most of the time, anyway.

374
00:35:49,814 --> 00:35:51,714
My daddy
gave me a doll.

375
00:35:53,217 --> 00:35:54,775
Her name is Annie,

376
00:35:57,021 --> 00:35:59,888
but I'm gonna call her Doll.

377
00:36:24,682 --> 00:36:25,808
Sorry.

378
00:36:25,883 --> 00:36:27,680
No, no, no,
you're doing good,

379
00:36:27,752 --> 00:36:30,448
it's the eggshell,
you're doing good.

380
00:36:40,331 --> 00:36:43,732
Maybe we should put
this in for a little longer,

381
00:36:43,801 --> 00:36:45,928
let it cook
on the other side
a little bit.

382
00:36:47,238 --> 00:36:49,263
Lay it down gentle like,

383
00:36:49,340 --> 00:36:52,741
a dog will sometimes
turn on you and bite
when it's his chow.

384
00:36:56,981 --> 00:36:59,472
Most dogs anyway.

385
00:37:01,052 --> 00:37:02,917
Let's go, ladies.

386
00:37:07,725 --> 00:37:10,592
Hey, this is how
you do it.

387
00:37:11,829 --> 00:37:13,023
Will they bite too?

388
00:37:13,097 --> 00:37:14,394
No,

389
00:37:14,465 --> 00:37:16,228
but they won't eat
out of your hand.

390
00:37:16,300 --> 00:37:18,325
They don't trust you.

391
00:37:19,670 --> 00:37:22,230
They tickle.

392
00:37:22,306 --> 00:37:27,471
Let's go,
we gotta feed the birds.

393
00:37:30,681 --> 00:37:32,774
Ooh, what a big black bird.

394
00:37:32,850 --> 00:37:34,249
It's a raven.

395
00:37:36,053 --> 00:37:37,884
"Follow a raven
into the shadow,

396
00:37:37,955 --> 00:37:39,582
and you will
find the light."

397
00:37:39,657 --> 00:37:42,217
That's from an old Indian
medicine man.

398
00:37:42,293 --> 00:37:43,624
What does it mean?

399
00:37:43,694 --> 00:37:47,357
They say the raven
brings people courage.

400
00:37:47,431 --> 00:37:49,763
He's a symbol of healing.

401
00:37:49,834 --> 00:37:53,634
Do you believe that?

402
00:37:53,704 --> 00:37:57,504
There's not much
I believe in anymore, Lenny.

403
00:38:00,111 --> 00:38:01,635
Do you feed it too?

404
00:38:01,712 --> 00:38:04,738
Oh, be damned
if I know.

405
00:38:04,815 --> 00:38:08,307
I guess so,
but I've never seen it eat.

406
00:38:08,386 --> 00:38:10,752
It just sits there
in that tree.

407
00:38:12,156 --> 00:38:13,919
It's pretty.

408
00:38:13,991 --> 00:38:16,221
That it is.

409
00:38:27,271 --> 00:38:29,262
You got running away
out of your system?

410
00:38:46,724 --> 00:38:48,055
Jake, look!

411
00:38:48,125 --> 00:38:49,114
It's a beach!

412
00:38:49,193 --> 00:38:51,058
That's where we headed.

413
00:38:51,128 --> 00:38:53,460
Yes!

414
00:39:24,261 --> 00:39:27,822
It's the best crab
I've ever had.

415
00:39:27,898 --> 00:39:30,765
I can't even believe
we caught all this ourselves.

416
00:39:30,835 --> 00:39:32,097
M m-mm-mm.

417
00:39:33,337 --> 00:39:35,532
Is this
what your friends eat?

418
00:39:35,606 --> 00:39:36,834
I n the woods?

419
00:39:36,907 --> 00:39:38,670
I'm not so sure
what they eat,

420
00:39:38,743 --> 00:39:40,904
but I bet
it ain't this fancy.

421
00:39:42,246 --> 00:39:43,235
Hey!

422
00:39:43,314 --> 00:39:44,474
We should invite them

423
00:39:44,548 --> 00:39:47,108
to go to the beach with us!

424
00:39:47,184 --> 00:39:49,652
Then take them back here
and cook them dinner.

425
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:50,709
What?

426
00:39:52,590 --> 00:39:54,217
Why would we do that?

427
00:39:55,226 --> 00:39:57,626
'Cause that's what friends do.

428
00:39:58,863 --> 00:39:59,852
Is that right?

429
00:39:59,930 --> 00:40:01,227
M m-hmm.

430
00:40:01,298 --> 00:40:02,890
They wouldn't come.

431
00:40:02,967 --> 00:40:04,764
Then we should go
to them.

432
00:40:04,835 --> 00:40:06,962
Let's have a picnic!

433
00:40:08,973 --> 00:40:12,033
I'm not so sure
that's a good idea.

434
00:40:13,344 --> 00:40:15,005
Wipe your mouth.

435
00:40:15,079 --> 00:40:16,068
Why not?

436
00:40:17,047 --> 00:40:20,175
Well, first of all,

437
00:40:20,251 --> 00:40:23,186
they might not want
to have anything to do
with us.

438
00:40:23,254 --> 00:40:26,018
And plus, maybe I don't want
anything to do with them.

439
00:40:26,090 --> 00:40:29,582
Maybe I'm happy
the way things are.

440
00:40:31,429 --> 00:40:34,330
You don't seem
very happy to me.

441
00:40:35,966 --> 00:40:38,491
Everybody's happy
at a picnic!

442
00:40:38,569 --> 00:40:40,594
I'll do all the work,
I promise.

443
00:41:05,963 --> 00:41:09,797
I n this dirty old part
of the city

444
00:41:09,867 --> 00:41:13,894
Where the sun
refuses to shine

445
00:41:13,971 --> 00:41:18,772
People tell me
there ain't no use in trying

446
00:41:21,979 --> 00:41:25,745
My little girl,
you're so young and pretty

447
00:41:25,816 --> 00:41:29,718
And one thing
I know is true

448
00:41:29,787 --> 00:41:32,153
It looks good enough
to eat.

449
00:41:36,126 --> 00:41:39,653
I'm having fun.
You having fun, Jake?

450
00:41:39,730 --> 00:41:41,357
H mm.

451
00:41:44,435 --> 00:41:46,494
You think they know
we're here?

452
00:41:46,570 --> 00:41:49,471
Nothing happens
in these woods
they don't know about.

453
00:41:49,540 --> 00:41:53,408
Besides, there ain't
a living thing
in this valley

454
00:41:53,477 --> 00:41:56,446
that can't smell
this food cooking.

455
00:42:22,573 --> 00:42:24,939
Do you hear
what I'm hearing?

456
00:42:32,216 --> 00:42:35,208
Sounds like somebody's
having a party.

457
00:42:49,300 --> 00:42:51,029
Nobody came.

458
00:42:53,370 --> 00:42:56,339
I didn't really
expect them.

459
00:42:58,776 --> 00:42:59,765
Hey.

460
00:43:03,881 --> 00:43:04,973
Hey.
Hey!

461
00:43:09,453 --> 00:43:11,045
Uh, Neeley.

462
00:43:11,121 --> 00:43:15,080
Oh yeah, I'd recognize
that truck anywhere.

463
00:43:15,159 --> 00:43:17,093
Thank you, bro.

464
00:43:17,161 --> 00:43:18,219
Welcome home.

465
00:43:18,295 --> 00:43:20,263
You too, my man,
you too.

466
00:43:20,331 --> 00:43:22,526
Mitchell.
Chopper, '68.

467
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:25,933
Army, '67.

468
00:43:26,003 --> 00:43:27,561
This here's Lenny.

469
00:43:27,638 --> 00:43:30,129
Lenny!

470
00:43:30,207 --> 00:43:33,370
It is indeed
my pleasure, ma'am.

471
00:43:34,712 --> 00:43:36,111
Can I interest you
in a beer?

472
00:43:36,180 --> 00:43:38,808
Oh yes sir, you can,
you most certainly can.

473
00:43:38,882 --> 00:43:42,318
We got some dead cow,

474
00:43:42,386 --> 00:43:44,445
a chicken or two.

475
00:43:44,521 --> 00:43:47,752
Yeah, my wife said
she smelled yard bird
on the grill.

476
00:43:58,535 --> 00:44:01,003
Ohhhh.

477
00:44:02,172 --> 00:44:05,437
Goddamn it,
look at all this food.

478
00:44:05,509 --> 00:44:08,910
It never crossed my mind
you'd have a woman.

479
00:44:08,979 --> 00:44:10,105
She's welcome too.

480
00:44:10,180 --> 00:44:12,114
Oh, well, uh...

481
00:44:12,182 --> 00:44:15,049
Cyd, she don't like
to leave the house much.

482
00:44:15,119 --> 00:44:17,053
Mind if I bring
one of these
back to her?

483
00:44:17,121 --> 00:44:18,520
Help yourself.

484
00:44:18,589 --> 00:44:22,650
Hey, Dinky,
get your arse out here!

485
00:44:24,428 --> 00:44:26,089
Chickenshit!

486
00:44:26,163 --> 00:44:29,132
Probably slobbering
all over himself
from the smell,

487
00:44:29,199 --> 00:44:31,565
but he hasn't got the guts
to come out on his own.

488
00:44:31,635 --> 00:44:33,364
How many more of you
are out here?

489
00:44:33,437 --> 00:44:36,702
Around here?
Well, there's, uh, Dinky

490
00:44:36,774 --> 00:44:40,232
and Red, oh and there's
some other vets
out in the deep woods,

491
00:44:40,310 --> 00:44:42,835
we trade with them
every once in a while.

492
00:44:42,913 --> 00:44:45,381
Dinky!

493
00:44:45,449 --> 00:44:47,007
Come and get
a brewsky!

494
00:44:49,186 --> 00:44:50,210
Oh, there he is.

495
00:44:52,856 --> 00:44:54,517
Booby trap?

496
00:44:54,591 --> 00:44:57,025
Oh, no,
he was running down an elk

497
00:44:57,094 --> 00:45:00,086
fell and busted his leg,
he set it himself but, uh,

498
00:45:00,164 --> 00:45:02,029
it never did mend right,
did it, Dink?

499
00:45:02,099 --> 00:45:03,862
No, damn thing.

500
00:45:03,934 --> 00:45:04,923
Hey.

501
00:45:05,002 --> 00:45:06,492
Hey.

502
00:45:06,570 --> 00:45:09,334
Marines, '70.

503
00:45:09,406 --> 00:45:13,137
'67, Army.

504
00:45:13,210 --> 00:45:16,509
Go on and get yourself
some grub, Dinky.

505
00:45:16,580 --> 00:45:19,515
Who's the little kid?

506
00:45:19,583 --> 00:45:21,141
Lenny.

507
00:45:21,218 --> 00:45:23,686
Kid of a buddy
of mine.

508
00:45:23,754 --> 00:45:25,779
Looks like a gook.

509
00:45:25,856 --> 00:45:27,653
Yeah.

510
00:45:27,725 --> 00:45:29,693
Her real name
is Lee.

511
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:32,422
She was born...
her momma was a gook.

512
00:45:32,496 --> 00:45:34,794
She was Vietnamese.

513
00:45:38,469 --> 00:45:43,566
Uh, yes, you're right,
she was Vietnamese.

514
00:45:45,075 --> 00:45:47,202
I'll be damned.

515
00:45:47,277 --> 00:45:49,768
Lenny, these guys
were in Vietnam too.

516
00:45:50,848 --> 00:45:54,045
Hi, girl.
How you doing?

517
00:45:55,385 --> 00:45:58,252
You remember the word
for crazy?

518
00:45:59,823 --> 00:46:02,053
You got it!

519
00:46:02,126 --> 00:46:04,720
Hell, honey,
that's his name too!
Dinky-dod.

520
00:46:04,795 --> 00:46:06,456
He's as crazy
as they come!

521
00:46:06,530 --> 00:46:08,862
Don't shake
her arm off, Dink.

522
00:46:08,932 --> 00:46:12,868
She could be

523
00:46:12,936 --> 00:46:14,995
Sure is a pretty
little thing, ain't she?

524
00:46:15,072 --> 00:46:18,473
Less talk
and I've got to get me
a beer.

525
00:46:19,743 --> 00:46:20,937
You know,

526
00:46:21,011 --> 00:46:23,104
you and Lenny
should come
and meet my wife.

527
00:46:23,180 --> 00:46:24,511
She was a nursing nun,

528
00:46:24,581 --> 00:46:26,913
used to hang out
at them orphanages
and shit.

529
00:46:26,984 --> 00:46:29,509
I got a lot of respect
for nurses.

530
00:46:30,988 --> 00:46:32,080
So, who's Red?

531
00:46:32,156 --> 00:46:34,624
Red?
Well,

532
00:46:34,691 --> 00:46:36,556
he's one of us,
sort of.

533
00:46:36,627 --> 00:46:39,460
He lives closest
to your place.

534
00:46:39,530 --> 00:46:44,763
He's watching us right now,
you can bet on that.

535
00:46:44,835 --> 00:46:47,827
Can you get him
to come out?

536
00:46:47,905 --> 00:46:50,567
Maybe, maybe not.

537
00:46:50,641 --> 00:46:54,475
He's, uh, got
kind of a short fuse.

538
00:46:54,545 --> 00:46:55,876
Gotta be careful
with him.

539
00:46:55,946 --> 00:46:58,073
He's got
so many booby traps
around this place

540
00:46:58,148 --> 00:46:59,672
I don't even go
over there anymore.

541
00:46:59,750 --> 00:47:02,116
'Fraid I'll get myself
blowed all to hell.

542
00:47:02,186 --> 00:47:04,120
That don't make him
a bad guy.

543
00:47:04,188 --> 00:47:05,519
Oh no,
that's true enough.

544
00:47:07,891 --> 00:47:10,416
I don't think he heard us
talking about your little girl,

545
00:47:10,494 --> 00:47:12,792
so, it should be
all right.

546
00:47:12,863 --> 00:47:14,160
Is she a problem?

547
00:47:14,231 --> 00:47:15,220
She could be.

548
00:47:16,733 --> 00:47:19,395
Keep your eye on her.

549
00:47:19,469 --> 00:47:21,403
Got it.

550
00:47:21,471 --> 00:47:24,463
Hey, Red?

551
00:47:24,541 --> 00:47:27,009
Red?

552
00:47:31,782 --> 00:47:33,010
We got food!

553
00:47:45,395 --> 00:47:46,384
Is that him?

554
00:47:46,463 --> 00:47:48,260
Oh, yeah.

555
00:47:52,502 --> 00:47:55,494
He don't talk any.
That's just the way
he is.

556
00:47:55,572 --> 00:47:57,437
Might be
he don't have
much to say.

557
00:47:57,507 --> 00:48:00,533
That could be
but

558
00:48:00,611 --> 00:48:03,512
funny thing is
I ain't never heard
Red make a sound.

559
00:48:03,580 --> 00:48:05,241
Not so much
as a peep.

560
00:48:05,315 --> 00:48:08,648
A walking bodybag,
that one.

561
00:48:08,719 --> 00:48:10,482
He died in the Nam.

562
00:48:20,664 --> 00:48:21,688
How you doing, Red?

563
00:49:01,939 --> 00:49:03,429
Thanks for the grub, Jake.

564
00:49:03,507 --> 00:49:05,975
It was all Lenny's idea.

565
00:49:08,912 --> 00:49:11,142
Thank you, Lenny.

566
00:49:11,214 --> 00:49:12,909
Lenny.

567
00:49:14,651 --> 00:49:16,516
You're welcome,
M r. Dinky-dod.

568
00:49:35,739 --> 00:49:39,505
And you go!
Go on!

569
00:49:42,980 --> 00:49:46,006
Hey! Hey!
What the hell
is his problem, huh?

570
00:49:46,083 --> 00:49:48,984
Some gook little girl
pulled a pin on a grenade

571
00:49:49,052 --> 00:49:51,452
and threw it at him,
blew half his face off.

572
00:49:51,521 --> 00:49:54,456
Aw shit!
That ain't right!

573
00:49:54,524 --> 00:49:59,359
That ain't right at all!

574
00:50:26,757 --> 00:50:28,418
We need reinforcements!

575
00:50:28,492 --> 00:50:31,222
Radio! Radio!
Get on the phone!

576
00:50:31,294 --> 00:50:33,524
Tell him we got heavy
automatic weapon fire!

577
00:50:33,597 --> 00:50:35,064
Shit!
Get down!

578
00:50:39,736 --> 00:50:40,725
Shit!

579
00:50:43,273 --> 00:50:45,400
Gardner!
Take out the hut!

580
00:50:45,475 --> 00:50:47,739
There's kids in there!

581
00:50:47,811 --> 00:50:49,642
They're killing us!
Do it!

582
00:50:49,713 --> 00:50:50,702
Now!

583
00:50:50,781 --> 00:50:51,941
No sir!

584
00:50:52,015 --> 00:50:54,108
It's a direct order!

585
00:50:57,087 --> 00:51:00,420
I made you some supper.

586
00:51:00,490 --> 00:51:02,685
Give it to Dog.

587
00:51:06,797 --> 00:51:07,786
Yes, sir.

588
00:52:14,097 --> 00:52:15,860
Where's my boots?

589
00:52:15,932 --> 00:52:21,199
I always leave 'em
next to my chair,
they're not there.

590
00:52:21,271 --> 00:52:25,332
Lenny!
Answer me, goddamn it!

591
00:52:29,079 --> 00:52:32,242
What the hell..?

592
00:52:32,315 --> 00:52:37,082
Why are my boots
under your bed?

593
00:52:41,758 --> 00:52:44,852
I told you
to leave my stuff alone!

594
00:53:31,975 --> 00:53:33,966
We're closed!

595
00:53:34,044 --> 00:53:36,274
It's Jake Neeley!

596
00:53:47,524 --> 00:53:48,752
What brings you out?

597
00:53:48,825 --> 00:53:52,386
I need something
to drink!

598
00:53:52,462 --> 00:53:55,295
How about
some coffee?

599
00:53:55,365 --> 00:53:59,324
How about you give up
playing the social worker

600
00:53:59,402 --> 00:54:00,630
and get me
some whiskey?

601
00:54:00,704 --> 00:54:02,296
How about
you kiss my ass?

602
00:54:02,372 --> 00:54:03,896
H mm.

603
00:54:03,974 --> 00:54:07,410
I only have beer and wine,
I'm not selling any to you.

604
00:54:07,477 --> 00:54:10,742
I don't want no damn coffee,
where is it, huh?

605
00:54:11,481 --> 00:54:12,470
Hey!

606
00:54:12,549 --> 00:54:13,914
Knock it off!

607
00:54:16,119 --> 00:54:18,349
All right, you want
to tell me what's going on

608
00:54:18,421 --> 00:54:20,946
or do I call the cops
and have your ass
hauled in?

609
00:54:24,561 --> 00:54:28,019
I can't do this anymore.

610
00:54:28,098 --> 00:54:30,066
She shouldn't be with me.

611
00:54:32,168 --> 00:54:35,001
What do I know
about taking care
of a kid?

612
00:54:35,071 --> 00:54:38,507
I figured he'd be back
to get her,

613
00:54:38,575 --> 00:54:40,236
but it's been weeks now.

614
00:54:40,310 --> 00:54:42,676
He could be dead
for all I know.

615
00:54:42,746 --> 00:54:44,304
Dead?

616
00:54:44,381 --> 00:54:47,282
He has lung cancer.

617
00:54:51,521 --> 00:54:52,783
No relatives?

618
00:54:52,856 --> 00:54:56,155
None that I could find.

619
00:54:56,226 --> 00:54:59,218
Her mother's dead.

620
00:54:59,296 --> 00:55:01,093
She should be
in school!

621
00:55:02,732 --> 00:55:03,858
Where is she now?

622
00:55:03,933 --> 00:55:04,991
At my place.

623
00:55:05,068 --> 00:55:06,501
You left her alone?

624
00:55:06,569 --> 00:55:08,537
She's sleeping.

625
00:55:10,607 --> 00:55:11,665
Probably.

626
00:55:12,909 --> 00:55:14,137
Oh crap.

627
00:55:16,479 --> 00:55:18,310
Maybe she
should stay here.

628
00:55:18,381 --> 00:55:19,370
With me.

629
00:55:22,018 --> 00:55:23,485
What?

630
00:55:25,322 --> 00:55:27,449
Well, you'd still be
taking care of her,

631
00:55:27,524 --> 00:55:30,493
she'd just be staying here
with me.

632
00:55:31,961 --> 00:55:34,555
You'd do that?

633
00:55:34,631 --> 00:55:35,996
Why?

634
00:55:39,502 --> 00:55:40,992
Well, certainly not for you.

635
00:55:44,307 --> 00:55:46,571
She's a very special
little girl.

636
00:55:50,980 --> 00:55:52,345
Yeah.

637
00:55:53,416 --> 00:55:56,442
Well, think it over.

638
00:55:59,022 --> 00:56:01,616
And now, if you are done
trashing the place,

639
00:56:01,691 --> 00:56:04,091
would you like
a cup of joe?

640
00:56:18,908 --> 00:56:22,105
You take cream or..?

641
00:56:22,178 --> 00:56:23,167
Hey!

642
00:56:23,246 --> 00:56:24,577
Put it
on my bill.

643
00:57:46,129 --> 00:57:48,154
Why did that man
spit on me?

644
00:57:49,766 --> 00:57:51,097
Listen kid,

645
00:57:51,167 --> 00:57:53,965
I'm not gonna explain
some damn thing to you

646
00:57:54,037 --> 00:57:55,902
that you'd
never understand anyhow!

647
00:57:58,174 --> 00:57:59,163
You're mean.

648
00:57:59,242 --> 00:58:02,006
You think so?
H uh?

649
00:58:02,078 --> 00:58:03,807
Well, fine!

650
00:58:03,880 --> 00:58:06,940
You won't have to listen
to mean old Jake

651
00:58:07,016 --> 00:58:10,144
cussing and yelling anymore!

652
00:58:10,220 --> 00:58:11,812
Tomorrow I'm taking you
to Kate's!

653
00:58:11,888 --> 00:58:13,048
What?

654
00:58:13,122 --> 00:58:14,680
I've had enough!

655
00:58:14,757 --> 00:58:17,453
You're gonna stay at Kate's
until your dad comes back!

656
00:58:17,527 --> 00:58:18,551
No!

657
00:58:18,628 --> 00:58:19,856
Yes!

658
00:58:21,231 --> 00:58:23,290
I'm not going!

659
00:58:23,366 --> 00:58:25,561
I'm not going
and you can't make me!

660
00:58:47,524 --> 00:58:49,856
Oh!

661
00:58:49,926 --> 00:58:52,053
Jesus!

662
00:59:05,842 --> 00:59:07,639
Lenny?

663
00:59:07,710 --> 00:59:08,699
Let's go.

664
00:59:10,813 --> 00:59:12,804
Time to pack
your things.

665
00:59:17,954 --> 00:59:19,353
Lenny?

666
00:59:30,500 --> 00:59:32,331
Damn it.

667
00:59:32,402 --> 00:59:34,097
Damn it to hell!

668
00:59:45,815 --> 00:59:47,373
Lenny!!

669
01:00:20,817 --> 01:00:23,615
Damn it.
Lenny!!

670
01:00:30,026 --> 01:00:31,323
Damn.

671
01:01:08,865 --> 01:01:09,854
Lenny!!

672
01:02:23,740 --> 01:02:25,708
Hey Lenny!!

673
01:02:25,775 --> 01:02:27,402
Lenny!!

674
01:02:27,477 --> 01:02:30,742
Lenny!
Answer me!

675
01:02:30,813 --> 01:02:33,213
<i>Lieutenant,</i>
<i>I got a bad feeling.</i>

676
01:02:33,282 --> 01:02:35,614
<i>A dead gook's</i>
<i>a good gook.</i>

677
01:02:37,854 --> 01:02:39,947
<i>Gardner, what the hell</i>
<i>is wrong with you?</i>

678
01:02:40,022 --> 01:02:41,148
<i>I'm not killing any kids!</i>

679
01:02:41,224 --> 01:02:43,624
<i>I'll kill you with</i>
<i>my gun damn it!</i>

680
01:02:43,693 --> 01:02:44,751
<i>Take out that hut!</i>

681
01:02:44,827 --> 01:02:46,158
<i>No!</i>

682
01:02:46,229 --> 01:02:48,663
<i>Damn you!</i>
<i>Give me that!</i>
<i>I'll do it I Agh!</i>

683
01:02:48,731 --> 01:02:50,323
<i>Lieutenant!</i>

684
01:03:05,515 --> 01:03:07,915
<i>You gotta do it, Gardner!</i>

685
01:03:07,984 --> 01:03:09,849
<i>Shoot!</i>

686
01:03:09,919 --> 01:03:11,409
<i>Now!</i>

687
01:03:13,256 --> 01:03:15,053
<i>Agh!</i>

688
01:03:15,124 --> 01:03:16,682
<i>Agh!</i>
<i>Oh God!</i>

689
01:03:17,994 --> 01:03:18,983
<i>I'm hit!</i>

690
01:03:21,330 --> 01:03:23,093
I didn't mean
to do anything wrong!

691
01:03:23,166 --> 01:03:25,964
<i>Goddamn you sons of bitches!</i>

692
01:03:28,671 --> 01:03:29,831
I'm sorry! I...

693
01:03:59,335 --> 01:04:00,802
Help.

694
01:04:00,870 --> 01:04:02,235
Help me, please!

695
01:04:16,752 --> 01:04:19,312
No!

696
01:04:27,663 --> 01:04:30,029
I'm not the girl
who hurt you!

697
01:04:43,045 --> 01:04:44,376
Lenny!!

698
01:04:44,447 --> 01:04:45,607
Jake!!

699
01:04:47,016 --> 01:04:49,917
I'm over here!

700
01:04:53,556 --> 01:04:54,955
Jake!

701
01:04:55,024 --> 01:04:56,389
Hurry!!

702
01:04:56,459 --> 01:04:57,949
Lenny!!

703
01:04:58,027 --> 01:04:59,927
Jake!!

704
01:05:02,832 --> 01:05:03,890
Lenny.

705
01:05:10,773 --> 01:05:11,762
Hold on!!

706
01:05:11,841 --> 01:05:12,830
Jake!!

707
01:05:12,909 --> 01:05:13,898
Hold on, Lenny!!

708
01:05:18,247 --> 01:05:21,774
Grab the branch!
Grab the branch!

709
01:05:21,851 --> 01:05:23,716
Grab it Lenny!

710
01:05:23,786 --> 01:05:24,946
Can you use
both hands?

711
01:05:25,021 --> 01:05:27,421
I don't know,
I'm scared!

712
01:05:28,324 --> 01:05:31,418
Good, now
hold on tight!

713
01:05:31,494 --> 01:05:32,722
Don't drop me!

714
01:05:32,795 --> 01:05:33,921
I... won't,
I won't!

715
01:05:34,964 --> 01:05:36,295
Give me your hand!

716
01:05:42,038 --> 01:05:43,835
Oh!

717
01:05:46,075 --> 01:05:48,134
Hey, you okay?

718
01:05:48,210 --> 01:05:49,507
Who was shooting?

719
01:05:49,578 --> 01:05:51,603
I don't know.

720
01:05:51,681 --> 01:05:52,943
What happened?

721
01:05:53,015 --> 01:05:57,145
I was running,
and I slipped.

722
01:05:57,219 --> 01:06:00,245
Damn girl,
your dad
would've killed me.

723
01:06:03,592 --> 01:06:05,355
Come here.

724
01:06:05,428 --> 01:06:10,229
Oh!
God, don't scare me
like that.

725
01:06:10,299 --> 01:06:12,460
Oh, God.

726
01:06:12,535 --> 01:06:15,436
Don't scare me
like that.

727
01:06:21,010 --> 01:06:22,705
Jake...

728
01:06:22,778 --> 01:06:24,973
my dad's gone.

729
01:06:27,416 --> 01:06:30,044
He's not coming back.

730
01:06:33,689 --> 01:06:35,316
He gave me this
the night he left.

731
01:06:37,360 --> 01:06:39,294
He's dead, Jake.

732
01:06:40,963 --> 01:06:42,396
I know it!

733
01:06:50,539 --> 01:06:51,733
I'm sorry.

734
01:06:56,512 --> 01:06:59,106
It's okay.

735
01:06:59,181 --> 01:07:01,775
Everything's okay now.

736
01:07:01,851 --> 01:07:04,411
It's okay,
it's okay.

737
01:07:04,487 --> 01:07:07,047
It's okay.

738
01:07:22,038 --> 01:07:25,371
I imagine you're pretty tired
with running away and all.

739
01:07:25,441 --> 01:07:28,171
You probably want
to go to bed
when you're done there.

740
01:07:28,244 --> 01:07:30,405
Oh no, Jake,
I'm wide awake.

741
01:07:30,479 --> 01:07:31,571
See?

742
01:07:35,117 --> 01:07:36,482
Let's fix up
my bedroom.

743
01:07:37,253 --> 01:07:38,686
Let's not.

744
01:07:38,754 --> 01:07:39,743
Okay.

745
01:07:42,158 --> 01:07:43,386
Will you read
to me?

746
01:07:45,261 --> 01:07:46,956
I don't have anything
you'd like.

747
01:07:52,735 --> 01:07:53,759
What about this one?

748
01:07:55,905 --> 01:07:59,966
H mm, let's see
what we can find out
about the raven.

749
01:08:06,582 --> 01:08:10,348
"Voice: Incredibly varied

750
01:08:10,419 --> 01:08:16,153
"With low deep baritone,

751
01:08:16,225 --> 01:08:18,284
"Croaks,

752
01:08:18,360 --> 01:08:21,454
"To high, fine,

753
01:08:21,530 --> 01:08:23,794
Twangy notes."

754
01:08:23,866 --> 01:08:25,857
Kinda poetic, huh?

755
01:08:25,935 --> 01:08:30,895
Oh, sorry,
does your arm
still hurt?

756
01:08:36,579 --> 01:08:38,376
No.

757
01:08:38,447 --> 01:08:40,039
Not at all.

758
01:08:41,884 --> 01:08:42,873
Read.

759
01:08:49,358 --> 01:08:55,661
"Has a long,
hoarse, croooooak.

760
01:08:55,731 --> 01:08:59,792
"Lower, hollow croak

761
01:08:59,869 --> 01:09:05,432
And deep resonant notes
are typical."

762
01:09:22,992 --> 01:09:25,051
Shhh.

763
01:09:27,730 --> 01:09:29,561
Go to sleep now.

764
01:09:33,769 --> 01:09:35,794
Good night, Lenny.

765
01:09:35,871 --> 01:09:37,133
Good night, Jake.

766
01:09:46,982 --> 01:09:49,212
I won't do it ever again,
I promise.

767
01:09:49,285 --> 01:09:53,415
Don't worry about it.
Doll can have it.

768
01:09:55,324 --> 01:09:57,815
Never really sat right
with me anyhow.

769
01:10:10,439 --> 01:10:12,407
Lenny.

770
01:10:12,474 --> 01:10:13,668
H mm?

771
01:10:14,944 --> 01:10:16,935
Why did you hide
my boots?

772
01:10:21,617 --> 01:10:24,211
So you couldn't leave me.

773
01:10:26,822 --> 01:10:28,756
I won't leave you, Lenny.

774
01:10:29,625 --> 01:10:30,614
Never?

775
01:10:31,360 --> 01:10:33,191
Never.

776
01:10:41,937 --> 01:10:44,872
You better go
to sleep now.

777
01:10:44,940 --> 01:10:46,373
Okay.

778
01:11:10,499 --> 01:11:13,764
Put it on his bill,
my ass.

779
01:12:33,482 --> 01:12:36,610
Jake, look!
It's eating.

780
01:12:39,254 --> 01:12:40,983
That it is.

781
01:13:15,057 --> 01:13:16,547
Oh!

782
01:13:19,328 --> 01:13:20,659
You got it, Jake?

783
01:13:20,729 --> 01:13:23,994
Ay, hold your horses, girl.

784
01:13:24,066 --> 01:13:25,363
Any problems?

785
01:13:25,434 --> 01:13:31,737
Nope.
I fed birds and ladies
and Dog and Cat.

786
01:13:31,807 --> 01:13:33,604
Even Raven
came down to eat.

787
01:13:33,675 --> 01:13:37,406
Well, I guess you can sit down
and close your eyes.

788
01:13:37,479 --> 01:13:38,503
No peeking!

789
01:13:38,580 --> 01:13:40,070
Okay!

790
01:13:40,149 --> 01:13:42,117
Is it a book?

791
01:13:42,184 --> 01:13:44,584
No.

792
01:13:44,653 --> 01:13:47,383
Is it something
for the cabin?

793
01:13:47,456 --> 01:13:48,855
No.

794
01:13:50,426 --> 01:13:51,893
Hold out your arms,

795
01:13:51,960 --> 01:13:56,761
it's something
just for you.

796
01:13:57,966 --> 01:14:01,902
Oh my God,
it's a baby lamb!

797
01:14:01,970 --> 01:14:03,494
Yes.

798
01:14:03,572 --> 01:14:05,506
You gave me
a baby lamb, Jake!

799
01:14:05,574 --> 01:14:07,064
Yes, it's a baby lamb.

800
01:14:07,142 --> 01:14:09,406
A baby lamb!

801
01:14:09,478 --> 01:14:11,639
Thank you! Thank you!
Thank you!

802
01:14:11,713 --> 01:14:12,839
You're welcome.

803
01:14:12,915 --> 01:14:14,940
It's the absolutely
most wonderful thing

804
01:14:15,017 --> 01:14:16,416
that's ever happened to me!

805
01:14:16,485 --> 01:14:18,282
Well, I know
just how you feel.

806
01:14:19,755 --> 01:14:21,339
Oh, cut it out.

807
01:14:21,374 --> 01:14:22,924
Oh, cut it out.

808
01:14:29,097 --> 01:14:34,057
Three, four...

809
01:14:34,136 --> 01:14:37,435
four, five, six,

810
01:14:37,506 --> 01:14:40,475
ten, eleven...

811
01:14:43,779 --> 01:14:45,144
Thank you.

812
01:14:45,214 --> 01:14:46,579
Hi, Kate.

813
01:14:46,648 --> 01:14:47,637
Hi.

814
01:14:47,716 --> 01:14:50,048
Oooh, your hair
looks pretty today.

815
01:14:50,619 --> 01:14:51,608
Thanks.

816
01:14:51,687 --> 01:14:53,746
Morning.

817
01:14:53,822 --> 01:14:54,948
Yeah, it's pretty.

818
01:14:57,559 --> 01:15:00,824
You have the list, Lenny.
Why don't you start?

819
01:15:00,896 --> 01:15:02,557
Okay.

820
01:15:05,501 --> 01:15:08,231
Uhm, listen,
about the other night.

821
01:15:10,239 --> 01:15:13,231
I could come in here
and act like it never happened.

822
01:15:14,843 --> 01:15:15,832
Uhm,

823
01:15:15,911 --> 01:15:20,610
and maybe
a few weeks back,

824
01:15:20,682 --> 01:15:22,707
I would've done
just that.

825
01:15:24,853 --> 01:15:28,084
I'm not the kind of guy
who likes to...

826
01:15:28,156 --> 01:15:30,624
show that side
of myself,

827
01:15:30,692 --> 01:15:33,092
so to speak,
none of this happened,
let me just...

828
01:15:33,161 --> 01:15:39,657
Oh, please stop,
it was entirely an accident,
I...

829
01:15:39,735 --> 01:15:42,226
Is that enough?

830
01:15:42,304 --> 01:15:45,364
Because if it ain't,
just tell me,
I'll pay whatever you want.

831
01:15:49,044 --> 01:15:51,376
It's been a long time
since I had any.

832
01:15:53,515 --> 01:15:54,777
And, uhm,

833
01:15:54,850 --> 01:15:59,150
I can't even remember
when the last time was

834
01:15:59,221 --> 01:16:02,452
so I'm not up
on prices these days.

835
01:16:02,524 --> 01:16:07,518
Fifteen, twenty, yeah,
whatever, you just tell me
the price.

836
01:16:13,302 --> 01:16:18,399
Okay, okay, I'm... I'm...

837
01:16:18,473 --> 01:16:20,236
I'm sorry
about taking the wine.

838
01:16:24,913 --> 01:16:25,902
The wine.

839
01:16:25,981 --> 01:16:27,608
And I know I've been

840
01:16:27,683 --> 01:16:29,981
a real horse's ass
over the years

841
01:16:30,052 --> 01:16:35,922
and I... it's difficult
to apologize,
but I got something for you.

842
01:16:42,931 --> 01:16:43,920
A peace offering.

843
01:16:45,634 --> 01:16:46,760
Oh!

844
01:16:48,303 --> 01:16:50,931
Well... you shouldn't have.

845
01:16:51,006 --> 01:16:52,337
It's freshly picked.

846
01:16:55,777 --> 01:16:56,937
Thank you.

847
01:16:57,913 --> 01:16:59,813
It's very nice.

848
01:17:05,621 --> 01:17:09,284
Sorry, uh, ten.
Ten's good.

849
01:17:23,405 --> 01:17:24,497
Wait, wait, wait!

850
01:17:26,875 --> 01:17:28,467
You forgot this.

851
01:17:31,513 --> 01:17:32,912
Yeah.

852
01:17:32,981 --> 01:17:33,970
He will like that.

853
01:17:46,895 --> 01:17:47,884
Hey, M itch.

854
01:17:47,963 --> 01:17:50,727
Hey, Jake.

855
01:17:58,874 --> 01:18:02,002
Yeah, Cyd, this here is Jake,
this is Lenny,

856
01:18:02,077 --> 01:18:04,238
there're the folks
I was telling you about.

857
01:18:04,312 --> 01:18:06,109
That had the barbecue
the other day.

858
01:18:06,181 --> 01:18:07,978
Pleased to meet you,
nice to meet you

859
01:18:08,050 --> 01:18:09,517
thanks for all
the supplies.

860
01:18:09,584 --> 01:18:12,144
He's been bringing them
all these years.

861
01:18:12,220 --> 01:18:13,551
I drew this.

862
01:18:13,622 --> 01:18:15,180
Oh!

863
01:18:15,257 --> 01:18:17,225
You're quite an artist.

864
01:18:27,969 --> 01:18:29,800
There's no wood.

865
01:19:07,943 --> 01:19:10,969
How come Red
didn't leave any wood?

866
01:19:11,046 --> 01:19:12,240
I don't know.

867
01:19:15,217 --> 01:19:18,618
Is this the first time
he hasn't left any wood?

868
01:19:18,687 --> 01:19:20,154
Yeah.

869
01:19:24,059 --> 01:19:25,287
Why is he mad
at me?

870
01:19:25,360 --> 01:19:27,920
I don't think
he's mad at you.

871
01:19:27,996 --> 01:19:29,554
Yes he is.

872
01:19:31,566 --> 01:19:33,500
Red's mixed up.

873
01:19:33,568 --> 01:19:35,433
He needs help.

874
01:19:35,504 --> 01:19:37,631
Can a friend
help him?

875
01:19:40,542 --> 01:19:43,409
I don't know, maybe.

876
01:19:57,492 --> 01:19:59,357
How come
you so quiet?

877
01:20:01,163 --> 01:20:02,425
I don't know.

878
01:20:08,270 --> 01:20:13,503
I think the schoolbus
will stop at the end
of the driveway.

879
01:20:13,575 --> 01:20:16,203
I've been thinking maybe

880
01:20:16,278 --> 01:20:19,441
we can build a bench
for Doll if you want.

881
01:20:28,089 --> 01:20:29,886
Maybe tomorrow.

882
01:20:29,958 --> 01:20:30,947
Okay.

883
01:20:31,026 --> 01:20:33,517
Anything special
you want to do?

884
01:20:35,197 --> 01:20:36,824
Go for a walk
or something?

885
01:20:38,567 --> 01:20:40,831
I think maybe Lamb
wants to go for a walk.

886
01:20:42,470 --> 01:20:43,732
You want me
to go with you?

887
01:20:44,973 --> 01:20:46,770
No.

888
01:20:46,842 --> 01:20:48,605
No, that's okay.

889
01:20:50,879 --> 01:20:51,868
All right.

890
01:20:53,248 --> 01:20:54,237
All right.

891
01:20:54,316 --> 01:20:55,544
Don't stray too far.

892
01:20:56,618 --> 01:20:57,642
Okay.

893
01:20:57,719 --> 01:21:00,711
I mean it,
stay real close.

894
01:21:02,891 --> 01:21:05,860
I don't want you
to jump off
no damn cliff.

895
01:21:43,765 --> 01:21:44,891
Come on.

896
01:22:07,055 --> 01:22:08,215
Shhh.

897
01:22:21,903 --> 01:22:23,894
I'm not afraid of you anymore.

898
01:22:30,178 --> 01:22:31,167
Want to pet a lamb?

899
01:22:36,151 --> 01:22:37,641
It's okay.

900
01:22:42,590 --> 01:22:44,455
I wanna be your friend.

901
01:22:50,799 --> 01:22:51,788
Lamb, wait!

902
01:23:33,241 --> 01:23:35,709
Jake!

903
01:23:35,777 --> 01:23:36,766
Jake!

904
01:23:36,845 --> 01:23:38,403
I'm here, what's wrong?
What is it?

905
01:23:38,480 --> 01:23:39,538
Red!

906
01:23:39,614 --> 01:23:41,878
I told you
not to go far!

907
01:23:41,950 --> 01:23:45,351
He's hurt, Jake!
He's hurt real bad!
You gotta help him!

908
01:23:45,420 --> 01:23:47,047
Okay!
Okay!

909
01:23:55,864 --> 01:24:00,392
Jesus Christ!
It's bad.
What... what happened?

910
01:24:00,468 --> 01:24:02,060
Lenny, what happened?

911
01:24:04,239 --> 01:24:05,228
He saved me.

912
01:24:06,374 --> 01:24:09,343
God, I gotta leave it in.

913
01:24:09,411 --> 01:24:13,040
Lenny, I need your help.
Come here!

914
01:24:13,114 --> 01:24:15,548
Push down here
to stop the bleeding.

915
01:24:15,617 --> 01:24:18,108
There, just like
I'm doing.

916
01:24:18,186 --> 01:24:20,211
I'm going to Mitchell's
for help.

917
01:24:20,288 --> 01:24:23,587
Look, be as brave
as you can.
He won't hurt you now.

918
01:24:23,658 --> 01:24:26,354
All right?
Look at me.

919
01:24:29,531 --> 01:24:31,692
You can do it, Lenny.

920
01:24:31,766 --> 01:24:35,167
You can do it.
I'll be right back.

921
01:25:00,795 --> 01:25:02,763
It's okay.

922
01:25:21,616 --> 01:25:24,016
Hey! Hey!

923
01:25:26,387 --> 01:25:29,584
Oh, you're so cold.

924
01:25:57,585 --> 01:25:58,609
Lenny!

925
01:26:04,192 --> 01:26:06,126
I... I was trying
to keep him warm.

926
01:26:06,194 --> 01:26:08,992
He's cold from losing
so much blood.

927
01:26:09,063 --> 01:26:10,394
I'll got get him
a blanket!

928
01:26:13,701 --> 01:26:15,999
Red, lie still!
Lie still!

929
01:26:16,070 --> 01:26:18,402
Lenny!!
No!!

930
01:26:23,912 --> 01:26:24,901
Oh my God!

931
01:26:24,979 --> 01:26:27,004
Oh Jesus!

932
01:26:38,560 --> 01:26:40,255
No!!!!!

933
01:26:40,328 --> 01:26:43,923
Lenny! Lenny!

934
01:26:43,998 --> 01:26:47,263
No, Lenny! No!

935
01:26:47,335 --> 01:26:53,501
Cyd!
You can help her, Cyd!
You can help her!

936
01:26:55,944 --> 01:26:58,845
Lenny.
You're gonna be okay.

937
01:26:58,913 --> 01:27:00,437
You're gonna be okay.

938
01:27:00,515 --> 01:27:05,748
You're gonna be okay!

939
01:27:05,820 --> 01:27:09,688
Come on,
come on, Lenny,
gotta get help.

940
01:27:09,757 --> 01:27:13,625
I gotta get help!
Where are we?

941
01:27:13,695 --> 01:27:15,890
Where are we?
Let me go!

942
01:27:15,964 --> 01:27:19,365
Let me go!

943
01:27:19,434 --> 01:27:22,767
Hey, Cyd!
You can help, Cyd!

944
01:27:22,837 --> 01:27:24,168
Somebody help her!

945
01:27:24,239 --> 01:27:25,228
She's gone.

946
01:29:00,001 --> 01:29:01,662
Jake?

947
01:29:07,141 --> 01:29:09,302
Jake, you in there?

948
01:30:12,940 --> 01:30:15,101
Don't do this
to yourself.

949
01:30:21,783 --> 01:30:23,808
Jake!

950
01:30:27,388 --> 01:30:30,414
I don't give
a damn about you.

951
01:30:30,491 --> 01:30:34,484
Give me the same respect
and leave me
the hell alone.

952
01:30:40,168 --> 01:30:42,898
You're just gonna sit here
and rot?

953
01:30:44,605 --> 01:30:49,406
Everything I touch
turns to shit.

954
01:30:49,477 --> 01:30:53,004
It's better this way,
better for everybody.

955
01:30:53,080 --> 01:30:54,741
No, my ass it is!

956
01:30:56,451 --> 01:30:58,715
This wasn't your fault!

957
01:31:00,521 --> 01:31:03,957
You're so damn full of yourself
you think you have
that kind of power?

958
01:31:05,326 --> 01:31:06,918
Get the hell
out of my house.

959
01:31:08,896 --> 01:31:10,386
Fine.

960
01:31:14,268 --> 01:31:15,826
But you're pathetic.

961
01:31:18,005 --> 01:31:19,666
You don't understand.

962
01:31:19,740 --> 01:31:20,968
Oh, don't I?

963
01:31:22,877 --> 01:31:25,107
You think
you're the only person
in the world

964
01:31:25,179 --> 01:31:27,409
who's lost
someone they love?

965
01:31:27,482 --> 01:31:28,972
Well, you're not.

966
01:31:29,050 --> 01:31:30,483
I know that.

967
01:31:30,551 --> 01:31:32,018
Do you?

968
01:31:33,154 --> 01:31:34,849
Do you?

969
01:31:42,396 --> 01:31:44,728
Do you know
how my husband died?

970
01:31:47,602 --> 01:31:48,591
No.

971
01:31:48,669 --> 01:31:49,897
No.

972
01:31:51,606 --> 01:31:54,973
Did you know
that I had children, too?

973
01:31:56,110 --> 01:31:57,668
A family?

974
01:32:02,350 --> 01:32:03,681
No.

975
01:32:06,153 --> 01:32:08,883
Then what do you
really know about anything?

976
01:32:13,794 --> 01:32:15,125
Nothing.

977
01:32:29,777 --> 01:32:34,407
They found this
when they cleaned out
Red's place.

978
01:32:34,482 --> 01:32:38,646
The chain's broken
but otherwise,
it survived.

979
01:32:41,122 --> 01:32:43,113
You know
where to find me.

980
01:32:43,190 --> 01:32:45,488
I have a son
I never met.

981
01:32:49,363 --> 01:32:53,459
A grown man by now.

982
01:32:53,534 --> 01:32:55,559
Probably hears
my cussing.

983
01:32:58,272 --> 01:33:01,935
We didn't know
she was pregnant
when we split.

984
01:33:02,009 --> 01:33:03,806
She told me later.

985
01:33:06,881 --> 01:33:11,716
I always wish she...
hadn't told me at all.

986
01:33:12,887 --> 01:33:14,445
What?

987
01:33:16,324 --> 01:33:17,951
Why?

988
01:33:20,795 --> 01:33:22,956
You can't lose something...

989
01:33:24,332 --> 01:33:27,233
if you never had it
to begin with.

990
01:33:30,805 --> 01:33:32,966
What I wouldn't give...

991
01:33:35,242 --> 01:33:38,109
to have
what you're throwing away.

992
01:35:17,278 --> 01:35:20,042
<i>My dad gave it to me,</i>

993
01:35:20,114 --> 01:35:23,311
<i>said it would lead me</i>
<i>where I was meant to go.</i>

994
01:35:26,287 --> 01:35:28,152
<i>I guess it did.</i>

995
01:38:49,790 --> 01:38:53,920
<i>Follow the raven into shadow,</i>

996
01:38:53,994 --> 01:38:56,189
<i>and you will find</i>
<i>the light.</i>

997
