1
00:00:06,274 --> 00:00:09,141
-Maybe Wilbur...
- Shut up!

2
00:00:09,177 --> 00:00:10,701
Damn it, damn it!
Shut up!

3
00:00:10,745 --> 00:00:12,303
Shut up, you crappy alarm!

4
00:00:14,516 --> 00:00:16,484
Oh, yeah, Pickles!

5
00:00:16,518 --> 00:00:20,887
- Pickles wakes up just like everyone else!
- What the hell are you people doing here?!

6
00:00:20,922 --> 00:00:23,322
- Hi, Pickles!
- Oh, God! I forgot.

7
00:00:23,358 --> 00:00:26,384
- Will you be the father of my kids?!
- I hate Fan Day.

8
00:00:26,427 --> 00:00:28,918
Do anything for Dethklok
Do anything for Dethklok

9
00:00:28,963 --> 00:00:31,158
Do anything for Dethklok
Do anything for Dethklok

10
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:32,564
Do anything for Dethklok

11
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:35,569
Dethklok, Dethklok
Dethklok, Dethklok

12
00:00:35,603 --> 00:00:37,935
I'll teach you

13
00:00:37,972 --> 00:00:40,338
Who rock

14
00:00:40,375 --> 00:00:42,070
Dethklok! Dethklok!

15
00:00:42,110 --> 00:00:44,510
Skwisgaar Skwigelf
Taller than a tree

16
00:00:44,546 --> 00:00:46,844
Toki Wartooth
Not a bumble bee

17
00:00:46,881 --> 00:00:49,543
William Murderface
Murderface, Murderface

18
00:00:49,584 --> 00:00:51,017
Pickles the Drummer
Doodily doo

19
00:00:51,052 --> 00:00:52,417
Ding-dong,
Doodily doodily doo

20
00:00:52,453 --> 00:00:53,715
Nathan Explosion

21
00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:01,455
It's being called the ticket of the century.

22
00:01:01,496 --> 00:01:06,559
Mordhaus, the home of Dethklok will
be open to the public for the first time...

23
00:01:06,601 --> 00:01:10,503
in celebration of this year's
lnternational Dethfan Day.

24
00:01:10,538 --> 00:01:15,840
Banks have closed because customers
are withdrawing all their life savings...

25
00:01:15,877 --> 00:01:19,335
in an attempt to purchase
one of these coveted tickets.

26
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:21,974
An official statement
from Dethklok calls this...

27
00:01:22,016 --> 00:01:26,510
"a psychotic day of insane celebration
for regular jackoffs."

28
00:01:27,689 --> 00:01:31,887
Dethklok is opening
their home to their fans.

29
00:01:31,926 --> 00:01:35,657
It seems that their popularity
is still growing at an alarming rate.

30
00:01:35,697 --> 00:01:41,260
We get most of our Dethklok information
by monitoring over 100,000 fan web sites...

31
00:01:41,302 --> 00:01:45,238
the biggest of which being
Diefordethklok.com...

32
00:01:45,273 --> 00:01:49,607
run by the Jomfru brothers
Eric and Edgar.

33
00:01:49,644 --> 00:01:54,980
They dropped out of Harvard
to become dedicated Dethklok fans.

34
00:01:55,016 --> 00:01:58,543
Their web site alone gets
more hits than all of South America.

35
00:01:58,586 --> 00:02:03,023
We can interrogate them later
and find out what's really inside Mordhaus.

36
00:02:03,057 --> 00:02:04,820
Yes.

37
00:02:12,467 --> 00:02:16,403
Hey, pals!
It's me...Face Bones.

38
00:02:16,437 --> 00:02:18,166
Welcome to Mordland...

39
00:02:18,206 --> 00:02:21,835
home of the international
metal band Dethklok.

40
00:02:21,876 --> 00:02:24,640
Now, we got a big list
of dos and don'ts because...

41
00:02:24,679 --> 00:02:29,514
we at Mordland like
to run a really tight ship.

42
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:33,077
Remember: our snipers
have new.50 caliber rifles...

43
00:02:33,121 --> 00:02:37,649
that can kill you from almost 3 miles away.

44
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:44,862
And remember: deadly force
is authorized, so do not ever enter into...

45
00:02:47,001 --> 00:02:50,960
And you have to use the restroom,
make sure and don't go into the...

46
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:54,098
And remember:

47
00:02:54,142 --> 00:02:57,270
no recording devices
or cameras will be allowed...

48
00:02:57,311 --> 00:02:59,973
or your life will be terminated.

49
00:03:01,182 --> 00:03:06,176
Now, Dethklok has decided
to allow you to listen to one secret song...

50
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:11,055
to be played one time only
for you, the fans!

51
00:03:11,092 --> 00:03:13,822
Fan song!
You hear that?! High-five!

52
00:03:15,663 --> 00:03:19,155
Why do I drink so much
before stupid Fan Day?

53
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:22,101
I believe you drink
because it's Fan Day.

54
00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:25,029
Don't talk to me about that.
Wait, where's Skwisgaar?

55
00:03:25,073 --> 00:03:27,234
Oh, I don't think
he's gonna be here for a while.

56
00:03:27,275 --> 00:03:31,177
He have a very big night
with a very huge fan.

57
00:03:31,212 --> 00:03:33,874
- Yeah, we were all up late.
- Not me.

58
00:03:33,915 --> 00:03:38,545
- I actually gots good rest.
- Will you please just be quiet?

59
00:03:38,586 --> 00:03:41,248
What's wrong, Pickle?
You just need to eat something.

60
00:03:41,289 --> 00:03:46,022
Your name is Pickle. Maybe
you should try a pickle-herring sandwich...

61
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:47,721
Famous from Oslo!

62
00:03:48,863 --> 00:03:50,091
Oh, yeah, Pickles!

63
00:03:50,131 --> 00:03:52,929
God! Everywhere I go,
there's fans everywhere.

64
00:03:52,967 --> 00:03:54,798
Can't I just throw up in my own house?!

65
00:03:55,937 --> 00:03:58,667
Oh, God!
Don't! What are you, bulimia?

66
00:03:58,706 --> 00:04:03,143
Oh, great. Now you're gonna
start a whole chain reaction puke-a-thon.

67
00:04:12,754 --> 00:04:15,985
Oh, blood puke!
Good song title.

68
00:04:16,023 --> 00:04:18,321
Someone write that...
Oh. That's right.

69
00:04:18,359 --> 00:04:20,156
We already wrote that.
Good song though.

70
00:04:21,329 --> 00:04:22,557
It should go back in the set list.

71
00:04:22,597 --> 00:04:25,430
Oh. I think I need
another liver transplant.

72
00:04:26,667 --> 00:04:30,159
Prepare to see one
of the greatest sights you've ever seen...

73
00:04:30,204 --> 00:04:34,664
The fastest guitarist alive
in his natural habitat.

74
00:04:46,821 --> 00:04:49,449
Need paper towels.

75
00:04:49,490 --> 00:04:50,957
OK.

76
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:55,193
My face is stucks to the wall.

77
00:05:10,178 --> 00:05:11,475
Oh, crap.

78
00:05:28,529 --> 00:05:31,464
In order to keep
Nathan Explosion healthy...

79
00:05:31,499 --> 00:05:36,334
and because of the tremendous drinking
it takes to entertain all Dethklok fans...

80
00:05:36,370 --> 00:05:39,862
Nathan must undergo
a series of liver transplants.

81
00:05:39,907 --> 00:05:43,900
- Have you eaten anything this morning?
- Nope.

82
00:05:43,945 --> 00:05:46,311
- Are you sure?
- I mean, yeah. I mean, no.

83
00:05:46,347 --> 00:05:47,814
OK. Anesthesia, please.

84
00:05:56,624 --> 00:05:59,889
Hey, guys!
It's me, Face Bones!

85
00:05:59,927 --> 00:06:02,418
Now is the time you've
all been waiting for...

86
00:06:02,463 --> 00:06:05,694
your very own exclusive,
super duper exclusive...

87
00:06:05,733 --> 00:06:08,861
fan song and one-time-only song video!

88
00:06:24,652 --> 00:06:25,710
Roll it.

89
00:06:26,153 --> 00:06:30,112
You people out there give us something
more than just record sales...

90
00:06:30,157 --> 00:06:32,284
you give us something to hate.

91
00:06:32,326 --> 00:06:35,318
And we hate you, you brainless mutants.

92
00:06:35,363 --> 00:06:36,557
Hate, hate, hate, hate

93
00:06:36,597 --> 00:06:38,497
Hate, hate, hate, hate

94
00:06:38,532 --> 00:06:40,397
Hate, hate, hate, hate

95
00:06:40,434 --> 00:06:43,494
Hate, hate, hate, hate

96
00:06:43,537 --> 00:06:45,630
You hunched and blinded mutants
Living in chat rooms

97
00:06:45,673 --> 00:06:46,640
You masturbate on the sheets

98
00:06:46,674 --> 00:06:47,834
Your mothers clean for you

99
00:06:47,875 --> 00:06:50,070
You have lined my pockets
Overflowed with gold

100
00:06:50,111 --> 00:06:52,477
You're living with your parents
And you're 35 years old

101
00:06:52,513 --> 00:06:54,378
You're a bunch of banks
That I'd like to rob

102
00:06:54,415 --> 00:06:55,746
You're my online cash transaction

103
00:06:55,783 --> 00:06:57,683
You're my future stocks
Transfer you like money

104
00:06:57,718 --> 00:06:59,583
To a Swiss account
Spend you on an impulse buy

105
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:00,814
And zero you all out

106
00:07:00,855 --> 00:07:02,618
Hate, hate, hate, hate

107
00:07:02,657 --> 00:07:04,488
Hate, hate, hate, hate

108
00:07:04,525 --> 00:07:05,992
Hate, hate, hate, hate

109
00:07:06,027 --> 00:07:09,588
Hate, hate, hate, hate

110
00:07:09,630 --> 00:07:10,654
I would like to get some sleep

111
00:07:10,698 --> 00:07:11,665
But you keep buying all our things

112
00:07:11,699 --> 00:07:12,666
My overhead is way too deep

113
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:13,962
For us to not keep making these

114
00:07:14,001 --> 00:07:15,161
It's way too cynical, you see?

115
00:07:15,202 --> 00:07:16,464
Hating what's supporting me

116
00:07:16,504 --> 00:07:17,698
I am not you
I thank the gods

117
00:07:17,738 --> 00:07:18,762
And if I were,
I'd die like dogs

118
00:07:18,806 --> 00:07:20,774
Die, die, die, die, die

119
00:07:20,808 --> 00:07:22,708
Die, die, die, die, die

120
00:07:22,743 --> 00:07:24,438
Die, die, die, die, die

121
00:07:24,478 --> 00:07:26,810
Die, die, die, die, die

122
00:07:26,847 --> 00:07:28,940
Die, die, die, die, die

123
00:07:28,983 --> 00:07:31,850
Die, die, die, die, die

124
00:07:31,886 --> 00:07:35,947
Die, die, die, die, die

125
00:07:38,592 --> 00:07:41,083
I'll be very glad when this is over with.

126
00:07:41,128 --> 00:07:43,392
If they only knew
how much we hated them.

127
00:07:43,431 --> 00:07:48,198
I mean, they just keep crawling back
like groveling putrid stupid zombies that...

128
00:07:48,235 --> 00:07:51,136
well, just want to eat
out brains that is our art.

129
00:07:52,673 --> 00:07:56,006
- Hey, what are you doing?
- He's in a wheelchair, my lords.

130
00:07:56,043 --> 00:07:57,135
I did not know what to do.

131
00:07:57,178 --> 00:08:00,739
That does not means you get free lunch
for entrance to everything.

132
00:08:00,781 --> 00:08:04,649
We are the Jomfru brothers,
proprietors of Diefordethklok.com.

133
00:08:04,685 --> 00:08:05,674
Really? That's interesting.

134
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:08,188
What are you selling?
You know, handicap stuff?

135
00:08:11,492 --> 00:08:12,481
No.

136
00:08:12,526 --> 00:08:15,859
We want you to pay
for a good review on our web site.

137
00:08:16,964 --> 00:08:18,090
That's rich.

138
00:08:18,132 --> 00:08:20,862
We are the fans.
We are the power.

139
00:08:20,901 --> 00:08:23,563
Without us, your precious
brutality means nothing.

140
00:08:23,604 --> 00:08:25,538
Take a walk before I kill you.

141
00:08:25,573 --> 00:08:27,370
Not so fast, Mr. Explosion...

142
00:08:27,408 --> 00:08:30,036
though I do appreciate
your simplistic views...

143
00:08:30,077 --> 00:08:33,478
of smashing that
which you don't understand.

144
00:08:33,514 --> 00:08:34,572
Effective.

145
00:08:34,615 --> 00:08:36,276
Oh, come on!
Screw that lnternet crap.

146
00:08:36,317 --> 00:08:38,649
I mean, come on, what is the lnternet,
you know?

147
00:08:38,686 --> 00:08:41,655
Seriously.
What is the lnternet?

148
00:08:43,391 --> 00:08:47,122
Perhaps you will give us more than a link
when we debut this on our web site.

149
00:08:47,161 --> 00:08:49,823
Hate, hate, hate

150
00:08:49,864 --> 00:08:51,161
Hate, hate, hate, hate...

151
00:08:51,198 --> 00:08:53,689
We've taken the liberty of appropriating
your exclusive song which is ready...

152
00:08:53,734 --> 00:08:58,068
to be hyperlinked and sold exclusively
on our web site with a single keystroke.

153
00:08:58,105 --> 00:09:01,268
How about we have a link
to the bottom of the stairs...

154
00:09:01,308 --> 00:09:04,334
by me throwing you to
the bottom of the stairs?!

155
00:09:04,378 --> 00:09:05,936
I think not.

156
00:09:16,791 --> 00:09:21,251
We'll give you the song back when we get
the money and not a moment before.

157
00:09:21,295 --> 00:09:22,284
Oh, whenever.

158
00:09:49,490 --> 00:09:52,186
So...
Where are you guys from?

159
00:09:52,226 --> 00:09:54,160
Sandusky, Ohio.

160
00:09:55,496 --> 00:09:57,794
There's an amusement park there, right?

161
00:09:58,966 --> 00:10:01,298
Yes, there is an amusement park.

162
00:10:02,369 --> 00:10:03,836
Well, that's always fun.

163
00:10:13,047 --> 00:10:14,446
Your money's way down there...

164
00:10:14,482 --> 00:10:16,609
behind that door. Can you see it?

165
00:10:16,650 --> 00:10:19,050
Hey, you better hurry up.
Closing time is in two minutes.

166
00:10:19,086 --> 00:10:20,917
All the way over.

167
00:10:21,989 --> 00:10:23,479
I'd serpentine if I were you.

168
00:10:25,159 --> 00:10:26,456
It's showtime.

169
00:10:26,494 --> 00:10:27,984
Why should we serpentine?

170
00:10:31,665 --> 00:10:33,257
Serpentine!

171
00:10:45,012 --> 00:10:46,138
Merci.

172
00:10:47,548 --> 00:10:49,516
Bon café, Jean Pierre.

173
00:10:49,550 --> 00:10:52,212
Thank you, my lord.

174
00:10:54,054 --> 00:10:55,783
You give us something to hate.

175
00:10:55,823 --> 00:10:59,520
But we hate you, you brainless mutants.

176
00:11:07,101 --> 00:11:09,228
You hunched and blinded mutants
Living in chat rooms

177
00:11:09,270 --> 00:11:11,397
You masturbate on the sheets
Your mothers clean for you

178
00:11:11,438 --> 00:11:13,565
You have lined my pockets
Overflowed with gold

179
00:11:13,607 --> 00:11:16,007
You're living with your parents
And you're 35 years old

180
00:11:16,043 --> 00:11:17,943
You're a bunch of banks
That I'd like to rob

181
00:11:17,978 --> 00:11:19,070
You're my online cash transaction

182
00:11:19,113 --> 00:11:21,308
You're my future stocks
Transfer you like money

183
00:11:21,348 --> 00:11:23,316
To a Swiss account
Spend you on an impulse buy

184
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:24,442
And zero you all out
