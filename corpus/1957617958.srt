00:00:00,741 --> 00:00:03,477
[music playing]

2
00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:20,995
[music playing]

3
00:00:56,596 --> 00:00:58,633
You're entering a
time of great chaos.

4
00:01:02,536 --> 00:01:05,739
That's why I've agreed
to listen to your offer.

5
00:01:05,772 --> 00:01:09,777
The commies are coming Mr Lee.

6
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:13,580
And they like to have
things their way.

7
00:01:13,613 --> 00:01:16,750
And you've got one of the most
successful underground fighting

8
00:01:16,783 --> 00:01:19,787
rings here in Asia.

9
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:23,757
But you see when
Beijing comes over,

10
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:26,427
things can be a lot different.

11
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:27,161
Am I right?

12
00:01:30,564 --> 00:01:32,900
What do you have to
offer Mr. Alderton.

13
00:01:32,933 --> 00:01:33,634
Well.

14
00:01:39,506 --> 00:01:40,708
You're an old man Mr Lee.

15
00:01:44,578 --> 00:01:45,746
But you and your
little Sheila here,

16
00:01:45,779 --> 00:01:49,950
you can find you
some island, retire.

17
00:01:49,983 --> 00:01:54,988
I take the whole operation,
move it across the pond.

18
00:01:55,021 --> 00:01:57,958
[laughter]

19
00:01:57,991 --> 00:02:01,862
A man who has lived his
entire life in Hong Kong

20
00:02:01,895 --> 00:02:05,366
requires more excitement
than Sydney can offer.

21
00:02:05,399 --> 00:02:09,136
There isn't enough money in
your poor, pathetic commonwealth

22
00:02:09,169 --> 00:02:11,605
to convince me to retire there.

23
00:02:14,074 --> 00:02:14,775
Poor?

24
00:02:17,377 --> 00:02:18,846
Pathetic?

25
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:19,680
Good day Mr. Alderton.

26
00:02:26,853 --> 00:02:28,622
I'm afraid it's
not that easy mate.

27
00:02:35,095 --> 00:02:36,797
You see my boss,
he tell me to come

28
00:02:36,830 --> 00:02:40,901
over and take your operation,
no matter what the cost.

29
00:02:44,738 --> 00:02:50,244
So I guess negotiations
had just broken down, huh?

30
00:02:50,277 --> 00:02:54,148
[gun shots]

31
00:02:56,249 --> 00:03:00,121
[screams]

32
00:03:24,578 --> 00:03:27,080
I think it's time to
contact our American friends.

33
00:03:30,984 --> 00:03:34,254
[music playing]

34
00:06:15,348 --> 00:06:18,752
[cheering]

35
00:06:39,272 --> 00:06:40,140
It's no good Paulie.

36
00:06:43,076 --> 00:06:43,777
Don't start this kid.

37
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:49,783
I fought hard to get here.

38
00:06:49,816 --> 00:06:52,486
We fought hard.

39
00:06:52,519 --> 00:06:54,287
We have.

40
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:57,758
And now we take the fall.

41
00:06:57,791 --> 00:07:01,862
Like the man said,
it ain't your night.

42
00:07:01,895 --> 00:07:02,596
It's not right.

43
00:07:05,799 --> 00:07:06,500
Right.

44
00:07:09,269 --> 00:07:10,470
I've been doing this
so long, I don't

45
00:07:10,503 --> 00:07:11,672
know what right is anymore.

46
00:07:16,342 --> 00:07:17,478
You really telling me that?

47
00:07:23,550 --> 00:07:26,486
Nah.

48
00:07:26,519 --> 00:07:28,588
I know what right is.

49
00:07:28,621 --> 00:07:30,757
Right is you fighting pro.

50
00:07:30,790 --> 00:07:34,027
It's scum like Mr
Lee behind bars.

51
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:35,228
You know what right is?

52
00:07:35,261 --> 00:07:38,198
Maybe it's the commies not
taken over in Hong Kong.

53
00:07:38,231 --> 00:07:41,535
And maybe it's petrol
at $0.60 a gallon.

54
00:07:41,568 --> 00:07:42,636
Yeah.

55
00:07:42,669 --> 00:07:43,770
That's what right is.

56
00:07:46,539 --> 00:07:48,675
When was the last time
you bought a gallon of gas?

57
00:07:48,708 --> 00:07:50,010
That's what I mean.

58
00:07:50,043 --> 00:07:52,546
It ain't right.

59
00:07:52,579 --> 00:07:55,882
But that's the way it is.

60
00:07:55,915 --> 00:07:58,919
Listen to me Shane.

61
00:07:58,952 --> 00:08:01,688
You don't cross these people.

62
00:08:01,721 --> 00:08:05,025
You cross them, you're dead.

63
00:08:09,028 --> 00:08:11,498
All right.

64
00:08:11,531 --> 00:08:12,266
I'll be a good boy.

65
00:08:36,422 --> 00:08:38,391
Relax my boy.

66
00:08:38,424 --> 00:08:39,793
Tonight is your night.

67
00:08:54,307 --> 00:08:57,778
Mr Lee.

68
00:08:57,811 --> 00:09:00,881
[inaudible], I thought
it was hot in Vegas

69
00:09:00,914 --> 00:09:03,283
until I came over here, Mr. Lee.

70
00:09:03,316 --> 00:09:07,788
Don Nicholas, you hone
my humble fight arena.

71
00:09:07,821 --> 00:09:09,221
Pleasure's all mine.

72
00:09:09,255 --> 00:09:12,091
And please, call me Uncle Nicky.

73
00:09:12,125 --> 00:09:15,629
Nobody calls me Don anymore,
except maybe the Feds, huh.

74
00:09:15,662 --> 00:09:18,332
[laughter]

75
00:09:28,641 --> 00:09:30,477
MR LEE: I appreciate
you coming all the way.

76
00:09:30,510 --> 00:09:31,477
Don't mention it.

77
00:09:31,511 --> 00:09:33,480
You know, if this
works out, there's

78
00:09:33,513 --> 00:09:36,516
going to be plenty of money
on the table for both of us.

79
00:09:36,549 --> 00:09:38,985
Ah.

80
00:09:39,018 --> 00:09:41,154
May I present Abdul.

81
00:09:41,187 --> 00:09:44,591
He's going to win
the contest tonight.

82
00:09:44,624 --> 00:09:46,526
When?

83
00:09:46,559 --> 00:09:47,828
What do you mean,
these fights are fixed?

84
00:09:50,964 --> 00:09:51,832
They better be. huh.

85
00:09:51,865 --> 00:09:54,534
[laughter]

86
00:09:55,535 --> 00:09:58,471
I'm just pulling your chain.

87
00:09:58,504 --> 00:10:00,606
And the other fighter?

88
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:03,577
He's, uh, how do you call?

89
00:10:03,610 --> 00:10:04,811
Resigned.

90
00:10:04,844 --> 00:10:05,946
Yeah.

91
00:10:05,979 --> 00:10:08,514
He's resigned to his fate.

92
00:10:08,548 --> 00:10:14,019
Well as you would
say, the fix is in.

93
00:10:14,053 --> 00:10:14,755
Yeah.

94
00:10:17,824 --> 00:10:21,228
[cheers]

95
00:10:29,335 --> 00:10:31,071
OK, ladies and gentlemen.

96
00:10:31,104 --> 00:10:33,373
This is the moment
you've all been

97
00:10:33,406 --> 00:10:35,542
waiting for-- main event time.

98
00:10:35,575 --> 00:10:38,879
Abdul, Abdul Sabbah,
where are you mate?

99
00:10:38,912 --> 00:10:39,980
Come on down.

100
00:10:40,013 --> 00:10:40,780
He's mean.

101
00:10:40,813 --> 00:10:42,082
He's fierce.

102
00:10:42,115 --> 00:10:44,683
He's a super fresh killer
all the way from the streets

103
00:10:44,717 --> 00:10:46,887
of Morocco, the Amazing Abdul!

104
00:10:58,564 --> 00:11:00,967
And in this corner.

105
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:01,967
He's wild.

106
00:11:02,001 --> 00:11:03,103
He's crazy.

107
00:11:03,136 --> 00:11:08,875
Our very own Hong Kong
lost boy, Shane McQuade!

108
00:11:08,908 --> 00:11:12,245
[cheers]

109
00:11:19,052 --> 00:11:22,355
Gentlemen, there's
only one rule.

110
00:11:22,388 --> 00:11:24,490
That's fight like men.

111
00:11:24,524 --> 00:11:26,426
I know you can do that.

112
00:11:35,001 --> 00:11:38,372
[bell rings]

113
00:11:47,146 --> 00:11:47,914
Damn.

114
00:11:47,947 --> 00:11:48,849
That was fast.

115
00:11:53,419 --> 00:11:54,888
Was that fast?

116
00:11:54,921 --> 00:11:56,323
Because it felt fast.

117
00:12:40,733 --> 00:12:42,702
You make it too easy.

118
00:12:42,735 --> 00:12:47,173
These boys are good Mr
Lee, best in the business.

119
00:12:47,206 --> 00:12:49,075
How do you find them?

120
00:12:49,108 --> 00:12:51,011
The slums of every city.

121
00:12:51,044 --> 00:12:55,281
It's just a matter of selection.

122
00:12:55,314 --> 00:12:56,483
Natural selection, huh.

123
00:12:56,516 --> 00:12:58,718
Like, uh, how do you call them?

124
00:12:58,751 --> 00:12:59,519
Evolution.

125
00:12:59,552 --> 00:13:02,154
Yeah, evolution.

126
00:13:02,188 --> 00:13:03,790
Survival of the fittest.

127
00:13:51,003 --> 00:13:53,973
How you doing kid?

128
00:13:54,006 --> 00:13:54,708
Never better.

129
00:13:58,144 --> 00:14:00,046
Keep it cool out there.

130
00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:02,415
Don't let them get to you Shane.

131
00:14:02,448 --> 00:14:04,317
You hear me?

132
00:14:04,350 --> 00:14:05,118
Yeah.

133
00:14:05,151 --> 00:14:07,520
I can hear you.

134
00:14:07,553 --> 00:14:09,822
Watch that temper.

135
00:14:09,856 --> 00:14:13,259
You only got two rounds to go.

136
00:14:13,292 --> 00:14:16,663
You can make it.

137
00:14:16,696 --> 00:14:19,231
[bell rings]

138
00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:34,880
Oh yeah.

139
00:14:46,893 --> 00:14:47,827
Oh yeah.

140
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:48,827
You know what?

141
00:14:48,861 --> 00:14:52,298
It's almost nap time.

142
00:14:52,331 --> 00:14:54,801
Good night.

143
00:14:54,834 --> 00:14:57,770
Aw, you want Mommy
to tuck you in?

144
00:14:57,803 --> 00:14:59,239
Is that what you want?

145
00:14:59,272 --> 00:15:02,876
Aw no you don't.

146
00:15:02,909 --> 00:15:04,510
I guess you ain't got a Mommy.

147
00:15:04,544 --> 00:15:08,281
All you got is that old,
drunk freak in the corner.

148
00:15:08,314 --> 00:15:09,082
Isn't that right?

149
00:15:23,095 --> 00:15:26,032
The white kid's got a
real flair for drama.

150
00:15:26,065 --> 00:15:28,968
He's quite a-- how
do you call it?

151
00:15:29,001 --> 00:15:29,869
Performer.

152
00:15:29,902 --> 00:15:31,504
Performer, yeah.

153
00:15:31,537 --> 00:15:33,873
He's a regular Meryl Streep.

154
00:15:33,906 --> 00:15:35,242
You'd almost think
there was no fix in.

155
00:15:54,660 --> 00:15:58,064
Son of a--

156
00:16:03,135 --> 00:16:06,105
1.

157
00:16:06,138 --> 00:16:08,608
2.

158
00:16:08,641 --> 00:16:10,109
3.

159
00:16:10,142 --> 00:16:12,579
4.

160
00:16:12,612 --> 00:16:15,081
5.

161
00:16:15,114 --> 00:16:17,083
6.

162
00:16:17,116 --> 00:16:20,587
Why'd you kill him man?

163
00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:23,255
7.

164
00:16:23,289 --> 00:16:23,990
8.

165
00:16:28,094 --> 00:16:30,063
9.

166
00:16:30,096 --> 00:16:34,067
9 comes after 8.

167
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:38,238
You don't know about
the [inaudible] you made.

168
00:16:38,271 --> 00:16:39,038
9.

169
00:16:39,071 --> 00:16:39,872
10.

170
00:16:39,905 --> 00:16:42,909
And the winner, Shane McQuade!

171
00:16:42,942 --> 00:16:43,876
[crowd repeatedly chants shane]

172
00:16:50,349 --> 00:16:52,285
Come on kid, we're out of here.

173
00:16:52,318 --> 00:16:53,786
Relax Paulie,
can't you hear them?

174
00:16:53,819 --> 00:16:54,688
They love Me!

175
00:17:04,130 --> 00:17:05,098
Yeah I can.

176
00:17:05,131 --> 00:17:06,566
Come on.

177
00:17:06,598 --> 00:17:11,069
I got to tell you Mr Lee,
I'm a little disappointed.

178
00:17:11,103 --> 00:17:12,572
This kind of thing
is totally, uh--

179
00:17:12,605 --> 00:17:13,839
Unacceptable.

180
00:17:13,873 --> 00:17:16,542
Yeah, unacceptable,
especially if we're

181
00:17:16,575 --> 00:17:19,479
going to consider picking up
your franchises in the States.

182
00:17:19,511 --> 00:17:22,548
Please accept my
humble apologies.

183
00:17:22,581 --> 00:17:25,018
If there is anything I
can do to make it up?

184
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:29,289
I'll think of something.

185
00:17:33,693 --> 00:17:40,199
Until then, I'll
be at the hotel.

186
00:17:40,232 --> 00:17:42,201
Good night.

187

[non english speech]

188
00:17:55,214 --> 00:17:57,282
Come on kid, move it.

189
00:17:57,316 --> 00:17:59,252
We got to get out of here.

190
00:17:59,285 --> 00:18:02,655
You probably have to leave town.

191
00:18:02,688 --> 00:18:04,857
Look, there's a name
and address, Alia.

192
00:18:04,890 --> 00:18:07,293
She'll get you out of this.

193
00:18:07,326 --> 00:18:08,127
What's got into you?

194
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:08,895
It was only one fight.

195
00:18:20,306 --> 00:18:22,008
Look, I'm sorry I blew it.

196
00:18:22,041 --> 00:18:23,842
But he called you
a drunk Paulie.

197
00:18:23,876 --> 00:18:25,310
I am a drunk Shane.

198
00:18:25,344 --> 00:18:26,946
Not anymore.

199
00:18:26,979 --> 00:18:29,048
Not so much.

200
00:18:29,081 --> 00:18:32,352
And anyway, the crowd loved it.

201
00:18:32,385 --> 00:18:36,422
Mr Lee wouldn't do anything to
harm his most popular fighter.

202
00:18:36,455 --> 00:18:41,394
Can he still be so naive even
after years of your training?

203
00:18:41,427 --> 00:18:44,597
He's just a hot
tempered kid Mr Lee.

204
00:18:44,630 --> 00:18:46,833
I'll, I'll get him into line.

205
00:18:46,866 --> 00:18:47,633
I promise.

206
00:18:47,666 --> 00:18:49,001
I'm sorry Mr Lee.

207
00:18:49,034 --> 00:18:51,204
I, I just got mad.

208
00:18:51,237 --> 00:18:53,539
You have to learn control.

209
00:18:53,572 --> 00:18:56,743
I thought maybe Paulie
would teach it to you.

210
00:18:56,776 --> 00:18:57,844
Perhaps he still can.

211
00:19:03,883 --> 00:19:05,985
You're quite right
about one thing.

212
00:19:06,018 --> 00:19:08,954
I can't injure my
most popular fighter.

213
00:19:08,988 --> 00:19:14,394
If I cannot hurt you,
how can I control you?

214
00:19:14,427 --> 00:19:15,194
No!

215
00:19:15,227 --> 00:19:17,764
Shut up Shane.

I'm sorry I brought
you here kid.

219
00:19:45,124 --> 00:19:46,426
You got to get away.

220
00:19:46,459 --> 00:19:48,361
You gotta go.

221
00:19:48,394 --> 00:19:49,729
No Paulie, no.

222
00:19:49,762 --> 00:19:51,630
I'm going to stay here with you.

223
00:19:51,664 --> 00:19:53,633
No.

224
00:19:53,666 --> 00:19:55,600
No.

225
00:19:55,634 --> 00:19:57,170
You, you gotta get away.

226
00:19:57,203 --> 00:19:57,904
Go.

227
00:20:05,611 --> 00:20:06,579
That was an avoidable accident.

228
00:20:12,451 --> 00:20:14,487
See what your rashness
has brought on?

229
00:20:22,795 --> 00:20:23,796
Good.

230
00:20:23,829 --> 00:20:26,264
These are the fruits of anger.

231
00:20:26,298 --> 00:20:28,701
Remember this.

232
00:20:28,734 --> 00:20:30,069
Don't worry.

233
00:20:30,102 --> 00:20:30,804
I will remember this.

234
00:20:41,447 --> 00:20:42,215
No.

235
00:20:42,248 --> 00:20:42,949
You'll hit me.

236
00:20:46,252 --> 00:20:47,520
Look's like we're
going to have to end

237
00:20:47,553 --> 00:20:48,388

Will you just get the

Ow!

SHANE: It's an emergency.

251
00:22:33,225 --> 00:22:35,895
Paulie knows I never
do business before dark.

252
00:22:35,928 --> 00:22:37,830
Let him hold your
hand until them.

253
00:22:37,863 --> 00:22:41,000
I'm just going to go lay down.

254

SHANE: Paulie's dead.

255
00:22:51,076 --> 00:22:52,778
He told me you could help me.

256
00:22:52,811 --> 00:22:55,781
I need to get out of Hong Kong.

257
00:22:55,814 --> 00:22:56,683
Come on in.

00:23:05,958 --> 00:23:07,360
OK.

I'm in.

00:23:08,193 --> 00:23:08,895
Where do you want to go?

262
00:23:11,697 --> 00:23:13,132
I don't know?

263
00:23:13,165 --> 00:23:15,568
Oh, that's not very helpful?

264
00:23:15,601 --> 00:23:17,837
How about Australia?

265
00:23:17,870 --> 00:23:18,938
Why Australia?

266
00:23:18,971 --> 00:23:20,673
You always want to send
people to Australia.

267
00:23:20,706 --> 00:23:22,408
Nobody wants to go there.

268
00:23:22,441 --> 00:23:23,476
It's nice there.

269
00:23:23,509 --> 00:23:24,477
No it's not.

270
00:23:24,510 --> 00:23:26,045
It's hot and dusty.

271
00:23:26,078 --> 00:23:27,213
It's got snakes.

272
00:23:27,246 --> 00:23:28,547
You haven't even been.

Of course I have.

Well, it's been--

276
00:23:32,017 --> 00:23:35,221
I have a friend in
America, Las Vegas.

277
00:23:38,257 --> 00:23:41,127
Nothing direct to Vegas.

278
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:43,029
Now how about Los Angeles?

279
00:23:43,062 --> 00:23:44,296
Is that close to Las Vegas?

280
00:23:44,329 --> 00:23:45,697

Might be.

That's good.

00:25:46,218 --> 00:25:49,522
Unless that car's coming
back, I think you need a ride.

Maybe I'll just stay here.

There is no here.

Las Vegas?

294
00:26:04,102 --> 00:26:05,938
That's the one.

295
00:26:05,971 --> 00:26:09,909
Well I hear that's not
much of a real place either.

296
00:26:09,942 --> 00:26:11,310
You got me there pal.

297
00:26:11,343 --> 00:26:12,044
Coming?

298
00:26:17,382 --> 00:26:19,318
Ah, thanks.

And you are?

No family.

00:27:27,386 --> 00:27:28,521
No family anywhere?

314
00:27:34,993 --> 00:27:37,629
Where you from?

315
00:27:37,663 --> 00:27:39,932
Very far away.

316
00:27:39,965 --> 00:27:40,833
What, like Asia or something?

317
00:27:43,669 --> 00:27:44,670
My mother was Chinese.

318
00:27:44,703 --> 00:27:45,604
How'd you guess?

319
00:27:45,637 --> 00:27:46,938
I can always tell.

320
00:27:50,242 --> 00:27:53,412
Listen Paul, I left
something in the trunk.

321
00:27:53,445 --> 00:27:56,849
I wonder if you could
get it out for me.

322
00:27:56,882 --> 00:27:57,583
Yeah sure.

323
00:28:18,303 --> 00:28:20,472
What is it?

324
00:28:20,505 --> 00:28:21,908
You'll know when you see it.

325
00:28:30,816 --> 00:28:31,517
Surprise?

326
00:28:36,288 --> 00:28:37,222
What the hell?

327
00:28:37,255 --> 00:28:38,190
Pick him up.

328
00:28:38,223 --> 00:28:39,157
What are you, nuts?

329
00:28:39,191 --> 00:28:40,059
Pick him up.

330
00:28:53,271 --> 00:28:55,406
That's a good boy.

331
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:56,342
Let's take a walk.

332
00:29:09,321 --> 00:29:10,589
This looks good.

333
00:29:10,622 --> 00:29:11,324
Put him down.

00:29:16,661 --> 00:29:17,763
Get to work McQuade.

That's your name, isn't it?

00:29:21,033 --> 00:29:23,702
Shane McQuade.

337
00:29:23,735 --> 00:29:26,105
Don't you know you're famous?

338
00:29:26,138 --> 00:29:27,840
Famous?

339
00:29:27,873 --> 00:29:30,075
Guess you haven't
seen the papers.

340
00:29:30,108 --> 00:29:32,845
You made front page a
few days back Shane.

341
00:29:32,878 --> 00:29:35,180
You're a one man
killing machine.

342
00:29:35,213 --> 00:29:37,750
First you break some
guys neck, and then you

343
00:29:37,783 --> 00:29:38,650
shoot your own manager.

344
00:29:38,683 --> 00:29:39,785
I didn't-

345
00:29:39,818 --> 00:29:40,853
Dig Shane.

346
00:29:40,886 --> 00:29:42,053
That's what I brought
you out here for.

Shane McQuade.

348
00:29:50,262 --> 00:29:52,764
How'd you get a name like that?

349
00:29:52,798 --> 00:29:55,467
I got it from a guy who
liked American Westerns.

350
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:56,335
Huh.

351
00:29:56,368 --> 00:29:58,070
I never liked Westerns.

352
00:29:58,103 --> 00:30:00,572
All that cowboys
and Indians crap.

353
00:30:00,605 --> 00:30:03,108
It's stupid.

354
00:30:03,141 --> 00:30:07,012
When I saw you, I
couldn't believe my luck.

355
00:30:07,045 --> 00:30:11,050
See, I was feeling
pretty stupid.

356
00:30:11,083 --> 00:30:13,919
Wore one of my best
suits today and forgot

357
00:30:13,952 --> 00:30:19,391
to change when I had to cap
this guy and bring him out here.

358
00:30:19,424 --> 00:30:21,225
Now I got you.

359
00:30:21,259 --> 00:30:23,729
Cheap labor.

360
00:30:23,762 --> 00:30:26,698
When I show you to the
boss, he'll split a gut.

361
00:30:30,669 --> 00:30:35,407
As soon as we bury this
guy, we'll head into Vegas.

362
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:36,809
You'll love Vegas.

363
00:30:46,852 --> 00:30:49,688
So, it's gonna be like this?

364
00:30:49,721 --> 00:30:50,489
I guess so.

366
00:34:57,235 --> 00:34:59,204
What does a guy have to do
to get a drink around here?

367
00:34:59,237 --> 00:35:02,708
Can't you see I'm busy?

368
00:35:02,741 --> 00:35:04,576
Not too busy for me, Jason.

369
00:35:10,515 --> 00:35:13,151
Jesus.

370
00:35:13,184 --> 00:35:13,886
Not quite.

371
00:35:16,988 --> 00:35:19,124
I gotta talk to
my old friend here.

372
00:35:19,157 --> 00:35:19,858
Come on.

373
00:35:27,399 --> 00:35:28,700
What the hell is
wrong with you?

374
00:35:28,733 --> 00:35:31,436
OK, well, I haven't seen or
heard from you in 10 years.

375
00:35:31,469 --> 00:35:32,570
Then one day I
read in the papers

376
00:35:32,604 --> 00:35:35,574
that you killed a couple
of people in Hong Kong.

377
00:35:35,607 --> 00:35:38,510
And within a week, you're
dropping in for a chat.

378
00:35:38,543 --> 00:35:39,711
Coincidence?

379
00:35:39,744 --> 00:35:40,612
I think not.

380
00:35:43,548 --> 00:35:44,783
We were best friends once.

381
00:35:44,816 --> 00:35:45,817
Once.

382
00:35:45,850 --> 00:35:47,319
Times change.

383
00:35:47,352 --> 00:35:49,054
You knew me then.

384
00:35:49,087 --> 00:35:50,255
You know I couldn't kill Paulie.

385
00:35:50,288 --> 00:35:53,925
What, you're telling
me it's a frame?

386
00:35:53,958 --> 00:35:55,994
Look, I just need a
place to lie low until I

387
00:35:56,027 --> 00:35:56,929
can figure out what to do.

388
00:36:00,131 --> 00:36:05,837
Well, uh, Dad always
told me not to believe

389
00:36:05,870 --> 00:36:07,038
what you read in the papers.

390
00:36:07,071 --> 00:36:09,808
Dad was right.

391
00:36:09,841 --> 00:36:11,743
You can stay with
me for a week.

392
00:36:11,776 --> 00:36:14,346
Then you move on.

393
00:36:14,379 --> 00:36:15,147
Thanks.

394
00:36:15,180 --> 00:36:16,515
I really appreciate this.

395
00:36:16,548 --> 00:36:17,783
Don't thank me yet.

396
00:36:17,816 --> 00:36:22,354
There's a little complication
you need to know about.

397
00:36:22,387 --> 00:36:24,323
I want you to have a drink in
your hand when I tell you this.

398
00:36:51,316 --> 00:36:54,119
Hey, you remember Marian?

399
00:36:54,152 --> 00:36:55,987
Marian.

400
00:36:56,020 --> 00:36:56,788
Marian Starret?

401
00:36:56,821 --> 00:37:00,692
Yeah, I bets that's the one.

402
00:37:00,725 --> 00:37:01,726
Damn.

403
00:37:01,759 --> 00:37:04,763
I haven't thought
about her in years.

404
00:37:04,796 --> 00:37:07,632
She broke up with me
after my first fight,

405
00:37:07,665 --> 00:37:09,668
around the time you
left for the States.

406
00:37:09,701 --> 00:37:10,869
Haven't seen her since.

407
00:37:10,902 --> 00:37:11,670
Yeah.

408
00:37:11,703 --> 00:37:12,604
I know.

409
00:37:25,917 --> 00:37:27,886
Hey, what's your problem.

410
00:37:27,919 --> 00:37:28,987
Sorry.

411
00:37:29,020 --> 00:37:31,423
Hey, why don't you watch
where you're going.

412
00:37:31,456 --> 00:37:32,757
Sorry, no problem.

413
00:37:32,790 --> 00:37:37,262
Hey, don't turn your back on
me when I'm talking to you.

414
00:37:37,295 --> 00:37:39,498
I thought we were
through talking.

415
00:37:39,531 --> 00:37:40,866
Oh, we're through talking.

416
00:38:53,004 --> 00:38:53,872
Thank you.

417
00:38:57,375 --> 00:38:58,910
Are you OK?

418
00:38:58,943 --> 00:38:59,711
Yeah, I'm fine.

419
00:38:59,744 --> 00:39:01,979
Thanks.

420
00:39:02,013 --> 00:39:04,750
And just what the hell
do you think you're doing?

421
00:39:08,686 --> 00:39:09,821
Gentlemen, gentlemen.

422
00:39:09,854 --> 00:39:12,223
That was just a bit of
extra entertainment.

423
00:39:12,256 --> 00:39:14,259
No need to be worried.

424
00:39:14,292 --> 00:39:17,195
Especially, because
coming to the main stage

425
00:39:17,228 --> 00:39:19,363
here at the world
famous Fantasy Island

426
00:39:19,397 --> 00:39:22,801
is our featured
entertainer, Miss Angelique.

427
00:39:41,753 --> 00:39:43,153
It's OK boss.

428
00:39:43,187 --> 00:39:44,556
He's a friend of mine.

429
00:39:44,589 --> 00:39:45,857
Those other guys started it.

430
00:39:45,890 --> 00:39:46,825
OK.

431
00:39:46,858 --> 00:39:51,563
Never start trouble,
just finish it.

432
00:39:51,596 --> 00:39:53,465
BOSS: Well, she's
got it. [inaudible].

433
00:40:01,906 --> 00:40:05,844
Hey, hey, hey, hey,
listen, listen, listen.

434
00:40:05,877 --> 00:40:07,445
My name is Marx Bender.

435
00:40:07,478 --> 00:40:13,284
And everything that
you see in here, I own.

436
00:40:13,317 --> 00:40:15,687
It's nice to meet you.

437
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:17,656
You looking for work?

438
00:40:17,689 --> 00:40:19,024
Doing what?

439
00:40:19,057 --> 00:40:21,760
Finisher.

440
00:40:21,793 --> 00:40:23,361
Come on, come on.

441
00:40:23,394 --> 00:40:25,863
I'm not talking about
nothing shady here.

442
00:40:25,897 --> 00:40:29,034
I'm talking about being
a bouncer, doorman.

443
00:40:29,067 --> 00:40:30,368
You know, that sort of thing.

444
00:40:30,401 --> 00:40:32,704
You might even be working
with Jason behind the bar.

445
00:40:32,737 --> 00:40:34,972
A little honest work
never killed anybody.

446
00:40:39,310 --> 00:40:40,145
All right.

447
00:40:40,178 --> 00:40:41,446
You've got yourself a deal.

448
00:40:41,479 --> 00:40:43,448
Great.

449
00:40:43,481 --> 00:40:46,151
Now Jason's going
to show the ropes.

450
00:40:46,184 --> 00:40:48,086
And by the way, what
do you call yourself?

451
00:40:50,855 --> 00:40:52,090
Vincent.

452
00:40:52,123 --> 00:40:52,824
Vincent Vasta.

453
00:40:56,861 --> 00:40:58,630
Well OK Vinnie, it's
nice to meet you.

454
00:40:58,663 --> 00:41:01,166
I can call you Vinnie, right?

455
00:41:01,199 --> 00:41:02,166
Yeah, sure.

456
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:02,901
OK, welcome.

457
00:41:06,804 --> 00:41:10,675
Uh, who the hell
is Vinnie Vasta?

458
00:41:10,708 --> 00:41:12,177
I am for now.

459
00:41:12,210 --> 00:41:13,578
Whatever you say Vinnie.

460
00:41:56,587 --> 00:41:58,323
[inaudible] Mr Lee.

461
00:41:58,356 --> 00:42:00,025
It's a pleasure to
make your acquaintance.

462
00:42:05,329 --> 00:42:07,798
My friends tell me you
have something to sell.

463
00:42:07,832 --> 00:42:08,933
Of course.

464
00:42:08,966 --> 00:42:12,437
Guns, the finest.

465
00:42:12,470 --> 00:42:14,873
Five case of Uzis,
10 cases of AR-15s.

466
00:42:27,885 --> 00:42:30,822
I'm prepared to
pay market value.

467
00:42:30,855 --> 00:42:32,891
Where is the merchandise?

468
00:42:32,924 --> 00:42:35,560
Right outside, in truck.

469
00:42:35,593 --> 00:42:36,661
Excellent.

470
00:42:36,694 --> 00:42:38,764
I will return it to
its proper owner.

471
00:42:44,936 --> 00:42:47,271
The United States Army?

472
00:42:47,305 --> 00:42:51,242
You hijacked a shipment
belonging to my Uncle Nicky.

473
00:42:51,275 --> 00:42:53,978
You know my Uncle
Nicky, don't you?

474
00:42:54,011 --> 00:42:55,113
So what.

475
00:42:55,146 --> 00:42:56,414
I stole from an American.

476
00:42:56,447 --> 00:42:58,483
What does it matter to you?

477
00:42:58,516 --> 00:43:01,385
I'm thinking of relocating.

478
00:43:01,419 --> 00:43:04,823
[gun shots]

479
00:43:04,856 --> 00:43:07,792
[gun shots]

480
00:43:07,825 --> 00:43:11,163
[gun shots]

481
00:43:16,701 --> 00:43:20,038
[applause]

482
00:43:28,446 --> 00:43:31,216
I didn't realize
you took such a--

483
00:43:31,249 --> 00:43:32,450
Proactive.

484
00:43:32,483 --> 00:43:34,786
Like he said, such a
proactive part in the business

485
00:43:34,819 --> 00:43:37,789
anymore Mr Lee.

486
00:43:37,822 --> 00:43:40,691
[moaning]

487
00:43:56,707 --> 00:44:00,579
[gun shots]

488
00:44:08,152 --> 00:44:10,488
This takes me back.

489
00:44:10,521 --> 00:44:14,124
I hope this humble favor which
I have done with my own hand

490
00:44:14,158 --> 00:44:16,928
will erase my
dishonorable shame.

491
00:44:16,961 --> 00:44:20,265
That's right Mr Lee,
we're all square.

492
00:44:27,204 --> 00:44:27,906
Speak.

493
00:44:32,310 --> 00:44:34,979
It's all right.

494
00:44:35,012 --> 00:44:36,714
We're a family.

495
00:44:36,747 --> 00:44:38,983
We have no secrets.

496
00:44:39,016 --> 00:44:41,251
Shane McQuade has been found.

497
00:44:41,285 --> 00:44:42,187
He's in Las Vegas.

498
00:44:45,089 --> 00:44:47,392
Las Vegas?

499
00:44:47,425 --> 00:44:49,928
Excellent.

500
00:44:49,961 --> 00:44:51,763
I think it's time for
you to start filling out

501
00:44:51,796 --> 00:44:54,399
those change of address cards.

502
00:44:54,432 --> 00:44:57,769
[laughter]

503
00:45:11,282 --> 00:45:13,651
Shouldn't make bets
you can't cover.

504
00:45:13,684 --> 00:45:14,552
Come on man.

505
00:45:14,585 --> 00:45:16,054
I just need a couple more days.

506
00:45:19,623 --> 00:45:21,959
That's what they all say.

507
00:45:21,993 --> 00:45:24,329
SHANE: Hey!

508
00:45:24,362 --> 00:45:25,729
Can't you see I'm busy up here?

509
00:45:36,974 --> 00:45:37,676
Come on.

510
00:45:45,716 --> 00:45:46,618
Kick his ass.

511
00:45:59,630 --> 00:46:01,032
Screw with me man.

512
00:46:06,037 --> 00:46:07,238
Thanks kid.

513
00:46:07,271 --> 00:46:08,373
Forget it old man.

514
00:46:08,406 --> 00:46:09,574
You know, you shouldn't
mess with those boys.

515
00:46:09,607 --> 00:46:10,708
They play rough.

516
00:46:10,741 --> 00:46:13,411
Yeah, tell me about it.

517
00:46:13,444 --> 00:46:17,448
Hey, hey, hey, where, where did
you learn to fight like that?

518
00:46:17,481 --> 00:46:19,050
Around.

519
00:46:19,083 --> 00:46:22,452
Hey kid, you got a lot
of speed and energy,

520
00:46:22,486 --> 00:46:26,090
but you've got no technique.

521
00:46:26,123 --> 00:46:29,360
I could teach you some things.

522
00:46:29,393 --> 00:46:30,395
No thanks.

523
00:46:30,428 --> 00:46:32,530
I think I can handle
myself just fine.

524
00:46:32,563 --> 00:46:34,699
Nah, kid, kid, you
don't understand.

525
00:46:34,732 --> 00:46:37,902
You seem, I'm
talking about money.

526
00:46:37,935 --> 00:46:39,404
You could make a living
with those fists.

527
00:46:42,440 --> 00:46:44,541
Easy old man.

528
00:46:44,575 --> 00:46:45,276
Shane.

529
00:46:48,012 --> 00:46:48,713
Shane.

530
00:46:54,018 --> 00:46:55,186
[gun shots]

531
00:46:55,219 --> 00:46:56,621
Don't leave me Shane!

532
00:47:01,625 --> 00:47:03,561
Don't leave me Shane!

533
00:47:03,594 --> 00:47:05,530
[gun shots]

534
00:47:05,563 --> 00:47:06,697
Shane.

535
00:47:06,730 --> 00:47:07,432
Shane.

536
00:47:12,937 --> 00:47:14,238
Marian.

537
00:47:14,271 --> 00:47:15,773
VINNIE: Sorry to wake you,
but you were thrashing around.

538
00:47:15,806 --> 00:47:16,941
I was getting a little worried.

539
00:47:16,974 --> 00:47:17,742
Oh.

540
00:47:17,775 --> 00:47:20,677
I had a nightmare.

541
00:47:20,711 --> 00:47:22,647
I've had a bad week.

542
00:47:22,680 --> 00:47:23,748
So I hear.

543
00:47:23,781 --> 00:47:24,549
No.

544
00:47:24,582 --> 00:47:26,050
It's not what you think.

545
00:47:26,083 --> 00:47:29,454
You don't have to explain.

546
00:47:29,487 --> 00:47:32,889
Besides, the less Jason
and I know, the better.

547
00:47:32,923 --> 00:47:34,792
You're right.

548
00:47:34,825 --> 00:47:36,727
You were always right.

549
00:47:36,760 --> 00:47:38,662
You never listened.

550
00:47:38,696 --> 00:47:42,467
I was always stupid.

551
00:47:42,500 --> 00:47:44,735
You were always right.

552
00:47:44,768 --> 00:47:46,571
You were always late.

553
00:47:46,604 --> 00:47:47,972
Hey.

554
00:47:48,005 --> 00:47:50,108
How you feeling?

555
00:47:50,141 --> 00:47:50,907
Better now.

556
00:47:50,941 --> 00:47:51,709
Thanks.

557
00:47:51,742 --> 00:47:53,211
Don't mention it.

558
00:47:53,244 --> 00:47:55,213
Bye honey.

559
00:47:55,246 --> 00:47:56,648
Good morning honey.

560
00:48:08,726 --> 00:48:10,128
10 years too late.

561
00:48:15,699 --> 00:48:19,104
[music playing]

562
00:48:59,610 --> 00:49:01,045
Would you look at this.

563
00:49:01,078 --> 00:49:03,447
It's fine sir.

564
00:49:03,480 --> 00:49:04,716
Why don't you call me Marx?

565
00:49:11,322 --> 00:49:13,891
You know, you're, um,
you look like you're

566
00:49:13,924 --> 00:49:15,293
in pretty good shape.

567
00:49:15,326 --> 00:49:16,294
You an athlete?

568
00:49:16,327 --> 00:49:18,362
I keep in shape.

569
00:49:18,395 --> 00:49:19,697
You ever play any sports?

570
00:49:19,730 --> 00:49:21,699
A little football,
a little baseball?

571
00:49:24,802 --> 00:49:26,269
How about boxing?

572
00:49:26,303 --> 00:49:27,672
You ever did any fighting?

573
00:49:32,443 --> 00:49:33,711
I mean, I'm just
curious, because you

574
00:49:33,744 --> 00:49:36,847
do have a fighter's build.

575
00:49:36,880 --> 00:49:39,282
Yeah?

576
00:49:39,316 --> 00:49:43,854
You see, I um, I do a little
fight manager on the side.

577
00:49:43,887 --> 00:49:44,722
Not interested.

578
00:49:44,755 --> 00:49:46,457
You know, I mean
I'm just saying,

579
00:49:46,490 --> 00:49:48,892
it is a good way to pick up
an extra buck here and there.

580
00:49:48,926 --> 00:49:52,330
I'm not interested.

581
00:49:52,363 --> 00:49:53,931
OK.

582
00:49:53,964 --> 00:49:54,666
OK.

583
00:49:58,135 --> 00:50:00,037
No harm in me asking.

584
00:50:00,070 --> 00:50:01,005
Enjoy the show.

585
00:50:08,979 --> 00:50:10,348
Ready to go?

586
00:50:10,381 --> 00:50:12,149
I've got a little
more cleaning up to do.

587
00:50:12,182 --> 00:50:12,950
You go ahead.

588
00:50:12,983 --> 00:50:13,718
I'll lock up.

589
00:50:13,751 --> 00:50:14,986
Thanks though.
-OK.

590
00:50:15,019 --> 00:50:15,953
All right.

591
00:50:15,986 --> 00:50:18,089
Don't make too much
noise coming in.

592
00:50:18,122 --> 00:50:19,156
I won't.

593
00:50:19,189 --> 00:50:19,891
Good night.

594
00:50:26,263 --> 00:50:28,799
Oh, I didn't realize
you were still here.

595
00:50:28,832 --> 00:50:29,734
Yeah.

596
00:50:29,767 --> 00:50:31,069
I took a nap after
my last number.

597
00:50:35,472 --> 00:50:37,475
Well, I could let
you out if you like.

598
00:50:37,508 --> 00:50:39,844
You're Vincent, right?

599
00:50:39,877 --> 00:50:42,046
You're Angelique.

600
00:50:42,079 --> 00:50:43,546
Name suits you.

601
00:50:43,580 --> 00:50:44,982
Thanks.

602
00:50:45,015 --> 00:50:47,618
Your doesn't suit
you very well though.

603
00:50:47,651 --> 00:50:48,986
Well.

604
00:50:49,019 --> 00:50:52,023
You don't look like a Vincent.

605
00:50:52,056 --> 00:50:54,892
How'd you get that name?

606
00:50:54,925 --> 00:50:58,296
I got it from a guy who
didn't like Westerns.

607
00:50:58,329 --> 00:50:59,363
He liked gangster movies.

608
00:51:03,133 --> 00:51:06,304
Did you see me dance tonight?

609
00:51:06,337 --> 00:51:09,674
Yeah, I caught a little of it.

610
00:51:09,707 --> 00:51:12,410
Little?

611
00:51:12,443 --> 00:51:14,945
Well, I try to keep my
eyes on the customers.

612
00:51:14,978 --> 00:51:17,048
Wouldn't want to
be too distracted

613
00:51:17,081 --> 00:51:18,916
if someone started trouble.

614
00:51:18,949 --> 00:51:20,418
Oh I see.

615
00:51:20,451 --> 00:51:22,053
So you're too busy
to watch me dance.

616
00:51:22,086 --> 00:51:25,488
Is that it?

617
00:51:25,522 --> 00:51:27,958
I think I can fix that.

618
00:51:27,991 --> 00:51:28,860
Have a seat.

619
00:51:35,265 --> 00:51:36,400
Vincent.

620
00:51:36,433 --> 00:51:37,302
You're not sitting.

621
00:51:50,714 --> 00:51:54,052
[music playing]

622
00:55:12,449 --> 00:55:13,150
Ah!

623
00:56:01,064 --> 00:56:03,000
ANGELIQUE: So where'd you
learn to fight like that?

624
00:56:03,033 --> 00:56:05,002
SHANE: Everybody asks me that.

625
00:56:05,035 --> 00:56:07,004
Do you [inaudible]?

626
00:56:07,037 --> 00:56:09,974
Not usually.

627
00:56:10,007 --> 00:56:13,543
Did you recognize those
men that attacked us?

628
00:56:13,577 --> 00:56:14,945
Just a couple muggers.

629
00:56:14,978 --> 00:56:16,579
I should have?

630
00:56:16,613 --> 00:56:17,848
They weren't muggers.

631
00:56:17,881 --> 00:56:19,883
They were in the bar yesterday.

632
00:56:19,916 --> 00:56:23,019
And tonight, they were
waiting by your car.

633
00:56:23,053 --> 00:56:24,888
Come on, you're scaring me.

634
00:56:24,921 --> 00:56:27,691
You're just being paranoid.

635
00:56:27,724 --> 00:56:28,492
Yeah.

636
00:56:28,525 --> 00:56:30,894
I've had a bad week.

637
00:56:30,927 --> 00:56:32,796
Oh babe.

638
00:56:32,829 --> 00:56:34,431
Turn around.

639
00:56:34,464 --> 00:56:35,232
Why?

640
00:56:35,265 --> 00:56:36,601
Just turn around.

641
00:56:42,005 --> 00:56:43,307
Oh god.

642
00:56:43,340 --> 00:56:44,108
Does that feel better?

643
00:56:44,141 --> 00:56:44,842
Oh yeah.

644
00:56:56,620 --> 00:56:59,590
What happened here?

645
00:56:59,623 --> 00:57:01,057
Like I said, bad week.

646
00:57:11,234 --> 00:57:14,105
[music playing]

647
00:57:18,175 --> 00:57:19,075
Watch the [inaudible].

648
01:00:07,244 --> 01:00:09,112
Shane.

649
01:00:09,145 --> 01:00:12,082
Shane.

650
01:00:12,115 --> 01:00:14,284
Please Shane, I don't
want you to fight.

651
01:00:14,317 --> 01:00:15,252
I hate it.

652
01:00:15,285 --> 01:00:16,753
But it's the only
thing I'm good at.

653
01:00:16,786 --> 01:00:18,722
That's talent.

654
01:00:18,755 --> 01:00:20,123
You got a talent.

655
01:00:20,156 --> 01:00:21,959
When you have a
talent, it's a crime

656
01:00:21,992 --> 01:00:24,260
against God not to use it.

657
01:00:24,294 --> 01:00:25,562
He's right.

658
01:00:25,595 --> 01:00:27,631
We can make a pile
of dough Vinnie.

659
01:00:27,664 --> 01:00:31,735
When you've got natural
talent, it's a crime

660
01:00:31,768 --> 01:00:33,704
against God not to use it.

661
01:00:33,737 --> 01:00:35,171
That's right.

662
01:00:35,205 --> 01:00:37,107
You're a killing machine.

663
01:00:37,140 --> 01:00:39,776
So kill.

664
01:00:39,809 --> 01:00:41,612
Goodbye Shane.

665
01:00:41,645 --> 01:00:43,113
SHANE: Marion.

[gunshot]

667
01:01:03,233 --> 01:01:04,468
OK you got it?
Let's go.

668
01:01:04,501 --> 01:01:05,402
It's lucky.

669
01:01:05,435 --> 01:01:06,436
OK.

670
01:01:06,469 --> 01:01:07,838
I'm ready.

671
01:01:07,871 --> 01:01:09,706
Heads.

672
01:01:09,739 --> 01:01:11,608
Yow.

673
01:01:11,641 --> 01:01:12,742
How do you do that?

674
01:01:12,776 --> 01:01:13,577
It's my thing.

675
01:01:13,610 --> 01:01:14,378
It's my gift.

676
01:01:14,411 --> 01:01:15,646
It's your thing all right.

677
01:01:15,679 --> 01:01:16,579
You talked to that guy?

678
01:01:16,613 --> 01:01:17,648
You talked to the guy?

679
01:01:17,681 --> 01:01:18,782
O'BRIEN: I talked to
the guy, the thing.

680
01:01:18,815 --> 01:01:20,150
HAUSER: It's going
to be at the place?

681
01:01:20,183 --> 01:01:21,551
O'BRIEN: How many times you
going to ask me about the guy,

682
01:01:21,584 --> 01:01:23,120
and the thing, and the place?
It's all there.

683
01:01:23,153 --> 01:01:23,987
It's set up.

684
01:01:24,020 --> 01:01:25,122
You don't got to worry about it.

685
01:01:25,155 --> 01:01:26,089
OK, OK, OK, all right Jesus.

686
01:01:26,122 --> 01:01:27,357
All right, OK.

687
01:01:27,390 --> 01:01:28,959
You ready?
O'BRIEN: I'm all set.

688
01:01:28,992 --> 01:01:30,027
HAUSER: All right, get tense.

689
01:01:30,060 --> 01:01:30,861
O'BRIEN: I'm tense.

690
01:01:30,894 --> 01:01:31,595
HAUSER: OK.

691
01:01:37,801 --> 01:01:41,605
So, would this be
your motor vehicle?

692
01:01:41,638 --> 01:01:42,940
Might be.

693
01:01:42,973 --> 01:01:44,975
Then you might
be Vincent Vasta?

694
01:01:48,178 --> 01:01:50,247
Might be.

695
01:01:50,280 --> 01:01:53,150
He doesn't look like Vinnie.

696
01:01:53,183 --> 01:01:54,084
What's this about?

697
01:01:57,487 --> 01:01:58,255
Detective Hauser.

698
01:01:58,288 --> 01:02:00,791
Detective O'Brien.

699
01:02:00,824 --> 01:02:04,126
So how can I help
you detectives?

700
01:02:04,160 --> 01:02:07,331
Well, if you're Vincent Vasta,
you can tell me where you've

701
01:02:07,364 --> 01:02:08,799
been for the last two days.

702
01:02:08,832 --> 01:02:10,801
And show some ID.

703
01:02:10,834 --> 01:02:13,303
On the other hand, if
you're not Vincent Vasta--

704
01:02:13,336 --> 01:02:18,709
which you might not be-- you can
tell us where you got this car.

705
01:02:18,742 --> 01:02:20,010
And why you
switched the plates.

706
01:02:24,114 --> 01:02:26,717
So maybe I'm not Vincent Vasta.

707
01:02:26,750 --> 01:02:28,285
Ah, hey, OK.

708
01:02:28,318 --> 01:02:30,020
That's a start.

709
01:02:30,053 --> 01:02:32,322
Look, I bought this car from
a guy a couple of days ago.

710
01:02:32,355 --> 01:02:33,991
Maybe that's Mr Vasta?

711
01:02:34,024 --> 01:02:36,760
[laughter]

712
01:02:36,793 --> 01:02:38,695
Vincent Vasta, car dealer.

713
01:02:38,728 --> 01:02:39,496
That's very funny.

714
01:02:39,529 --> 01:02:41,064
That's hilarious.

715
01:02:41,097 --> 01:02:42,699
Ain't exactly his line of work.

716
01:02:42,732 --> 01:02:43,967
No, no.

717
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:46,970
Well what exactly is
Mr. Vasta's line of work?

718
01:02:47,003 --> 01:02:48,005
Hmm.

719
01:02:48,038 --> 01:02:50,240
What would you call
what Vinnie does?

720
01:02:50,273 --> 01:02:52,376
Um, button man.

721
01:02:52,409 --> 01:02:54,677
Button man?

722
01:02:54,711 --> 01:02:56,079
Hit man, hired killer.

723
01:02:56,112 --> 01:02:57,780
You get the picture?

724
01:02:57,814 --> 01:03:00,017
Jeez.

725
01:03:00,050 --> 01:03:04,421
Let's uh, let's see your
license and your pink slip.

726
01:03:04,454 --> 01:03:08,057
And your registration
and insurance.

727
01:03:08,091 --> 01:03:10,627
Et cetera.

728
01:03:10,660 --> 01:03:11,728
Sure guys.

729
01:03:11,761 --> 01:03:14,197
It's in the glove box.

730
01:03:14,230 --> 01:03:15,899
Why don't you go for it.

731
01:03:15,932 --> 01:03:18,135
Yeah, nice and easy, eh?

732
01:03:29,913 --> 01:03:31,948
You're not really cops are you?

733
01:03:31,981 --> 01:03:33,283
Cops?

734
01:03:33,316 --> 01:03:36,286
Did, did we say we was cops?

735
01:03:36,319 --> 01:03:37,788
That we did.

736
01:03:37,821 --> 01:03:41,725
But you guys showed me
your wallets and everything.

737
01:03:41,758 --> 01:03:43,427
What did you do
to Vinnie scumbag?

738
01:03:47,931 --> 01:03:50,333
I killed him.

739
01:03:50,366 --> 01:03:51,334
Yeah?

740
01:03:51,367 --> 01:03:54,237
That right cowboy?

741
01:03:54,270 --> 01:03:56,139
Big goddamn mistake.

742
01:03:56,172 --> 01:04:00,043
Well, it seemed like a
good idea at the time.

743
01:04:00,076 --> 01:04:02,446
Just like this.

744
01:04:02,479 --> 01:04:05,816
[gun shots]

745
01:04:14,757 --> 01:04:16,392
Why'd you kill Vinnie?

746
01:04:16,426 --> 01:04:19,329
He was trying to kill me.

747
01:04:19,362 --> 01:04:22,099
That sounds like Vinnie.

748
01:04:22,132 --> 01:04:24,934
You realize I'm going
to have to kill you?

749
01:04:24,968 --> 01:04:29,940
Well, you're more
than welcome to try.

750
01:04:29,973 --> 01:04:30,874
Okey dokey.

751
01:04:39,382 --> 01:04:42,251
[gun shots]

752
01:04:56,232 --> 01:04:59,570
[gun shots]

753
01:05:25,261 --> 01:05:26,263
Where the hell were you?

754
01:05:30,066 --> 01:05:31,268
I was out.

755
01:05:31,301 --> 01:05:32,769
That's just great Shane.

756
01:05:32,802 --> 01:05:34,336
Or should I say Vinnie?

757
01:05:34,370 --> 01:05:35,405
I'm sorry.

758
01:05:35,438 --> 01:05:36,206
I should have called.

759
01:05:36,239 --> 01:05:38,642
Damn right you should have.

760
01:05:38,675 --> 01:05:41,778
Look, I know you have
problems, but you're

761
01:05:41,811 --> 01:05:44,248
going to bring those
problems to Jason and to me.

762
01:05:48,251 --> 01:05:49,419
JASON: You asked to see me?

763
01:05:49,452 --> 01:05:50,220
Yeah, yeah.

764
01:05:50,253 --> 01:05:51,086
Come on in.

765
01:05:51,120 --> 01:05:51,989
Sit down.

766
01:05:56,459 --> 01:05:58,495
So.

767
01:05:58,528 --> 01:06:00,430
How long you known old Vinnie?

768
01:06:00,463 --> 01:06:02,566
Well, I used to
live in Hong Kong.

769
01:06:02,599 --> 01:06:04,267
That was about 10 years ago.

770
01:06:07,804 --> 01:06:09,439
Pretty tough fellow, huh?

771
01:06:09,472 --> 01:06:10,174
Tough enough.

772
01:06:13,209 --> 01:06:16,613
Has he done any pro fighting?

773
01:06:16,646 --> 01:06:21,051
Uh, not that I know of sir.

774
01:06:21,084 --> 01:06:23,687
It's just that,
just that I asked

775
01:06:23,720 --> 01:06:26,022
him about it the other
day and he got real tense.

776
01:06:26,055 --> 01:06:27,224
Seemed as if I touched a nerve.

777
01:06:31,861 --> 01:06:33,663
OK Jace, let me
get to the point.

778
01:06:33,696 --> 01:06:37,067
As you know I do a little
fight promoting on the side.

779
01:06:37,100 --> 01:06:39,436
Strictly underground,
no big deal.

780
01:06:39,469 --> 01:06:40,869
And I've got a
feeling from watching

781
01:06:40,903 --> 01:06:44,741
your pal Vinnie that he
could be a hell of a fighter.

782
01:06:44,774 --> 01:06:46,209
We'd make a whole lot of money.

783
01:06:46,242 --> 01:06:48,577
You want me to talk to him.

784
01:06:48,611 --> 01:06:51,782
[laughter]

785
01:06:53,783 --> 01:06:54,851
That's why I like you.

786
01:06:54,884 --> 01:06:55,919
You are smart, Jace.

787
01:06:55,952 --> 01:06:58,555
You're smart.

788
01:06:58,588 --> 01:06:59,522
Yeah.

789
01:06:59,555 --> 01:07:01,224
Talk to him.

790
01:07:01,257 --> 01:07:02,892
Convince him to
take on a few bouts.

791
01:07:05,828 --> 01:07:06,596
Sure thing.

792
01:07:06,629 --> 01:07:10,367
I'll do my best.

793
01:07:10,400 --> 01:07:13,637
Jace, you'll do
better than that.

794
01:07:13,670 --> 01:07:14,871
You see, because
I'm going to be very

795
01:07:14,904 --> 01:07:17,407
disappointed if your friend
Vinnie turns me down.

796
01:07:17,440 --> 01:07:18,474
You know what I mean?

797
01:07:21,511 --> 01:07:24,481
I just hand;e
disappointment that well.

798
01:07:24,514 --> 01:07:27,150
It's always been one of my
biggest character flaws.

799
01:07:30,820 --> 01:07:31,720
Yeah, well don't worry sir.

800
01:07:31,754 --> 01:07:34,257
I'm sure he'll come around.

801
01:07:34,290 --> 01:07:34,992
OK.

802
01:08:01,584 --> 01:08:03,620
Shane.

803
01:08:03,653 --> 01:08:06,556
Shane, I didn't mean to
kick you out or anything.

804
01:08:06,589 --> 01:08:07,357
It was just--

805
01:08:07,390 --> 01:08:09,992
You were right.

806
01:08:10,026 --> 01:08:12,696
You're always right.

807
01:08:12,729 --> 01:08:15,932
And you're always late.

808
01:08:15,965 --> 01:08:17,367
You know, I got
a way of bringing

809
01:08:17,400 --> 01:08:19,902
trouble with me wherever I go.

810
01:08:19,936 --> 01:08:23,440
Maybe if I take off, I can
get out of here before I

811
01:08:23,473 --> 01:08:26,643
drag Jason into it, and you.

812
01:08:26,675 --> 01:08:27,477
Look, I'm sorry.

813
01:08:31,647 --> 01:08:32,482
Yeah, me too.

814
01:08:35,418 --> 01:08:37,053
Look, tell Jason I had to go.

815
01:08:37,086 --> 01:08:38,154
No.

816
01:08:38,187 --> 01:08:40,790
Why don't you go and
say goodbye yourself?

817
01:08:40,822 --> 01:08:42,758
All right.

818
01:08:42,791 --> 01:08:43,693
I will.

819
01:09:13,089 --> 01:09:13,857
Hey.

820
01:09:13,889 --> 01:09:15,124
Hey.

821
01:09:15,157 --> 01:09:16,925
Where you been buddy?

822
01:09:16,959 --> 01:09:20,429
Jason, I'm leaving.

823
01:09:20,463 --> 01:09:21,764
What do you mean?

824
01:09:21,798 --> 01:09:22,565
I'm leaving here.

825
01:09:22,598 --> 01:09:24,067
I'm leaving town.

826
01:09:24,099 --> 01:09:25,067
Moving on.

827
01:09:25,101 --> 01:09:26,536
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
you can't go now.

828
01:09:26,568 --> 01:09:29,071
You just got here.

829
01:09:29,104 --> 01:09:30,572
Listen.

830
01:09:30,606 --> 01:09:35,411
Mr Bender wants you
to fight for him.

831
01:09:35,445 --> 01:09:37,013
He's got a little side
business, and he thinks

832
01:09:37,045 --> 01:09:40,282
you can make a lot of money.

833
01:09:40,316 --> 01:09:41,084
Look.

834
01:09:41,117 --> 01:09:42,752
I already told him.

835
01:09:42,785 --> 01:09:44,754
I'm not fighting anymore.

836
01:09:44,787 --> 01:09:45,688
Come on, come on.

837
01:09:45,720 --> 01:09:48,825
At least just talk
to the guy, OK?

838
01:09:48,858 --> 01:09:51,227
One last time, before you go.

839
01:09:51,260 --> 01:09:53,062
Maybe he can convince you.

840
01:09:53,095 --> 01:09:54,130
Oh, Jason.

841
01:09:54,163 --> 01:09:55,865
For me.

842
01:09:55,898 --> 01:09:57,133
Just do me this one favor.

843
01:09:57,166 --> 01:09:59,736
Talk to the man, OK?

844
01:09:59,769 --> 01:10:01,438
Then you can, you
can go your own way.

845
01:10:06,375 --> 01:10:07,977
All right.

846
01:10:08,010 --> 01:10:10,547
I'll talk to him.

847
01:10:10,580 --> 01:10:11,514
Great.

848
01:10:11,547 --> 01:10:12,249
Follow me.

849
01:10:17,820 --> 01:10:20,757
62,300.

850
01:10:20,790 --> 01:10:22,759
Yeah.

851
01:10:22,792 --> 01:10:24,259
Thanks.

852
01:10:24,293 --> 01:10:27,130
Bye bye.

853
01:10:27,163 --> 01:10:29,065
Look Mr Bender, I'm good.

854
01:10:29,098 --> 01:10:29,866
I won't fight.

855
01:10:29,899 --> 01:10:31,567
I've had enough of it.

856
01:10:31,601 --> 01:10:34,037
I came in here as a
favor to Jason, but--

857
01:10:34,070 --> 01:10:36,239
No buts.

858
01:10:36,272 --> 01:10:41,144
What's going to happen if
I call the police, Vinnie?

859
01:10:41,177 --> 01:10:43,079
Or should I say Shane?

860
01:10:43,112 --> 01:10:46,483
I recognized you the minute you
walked through the front door.

861
01:10:46,516 --> 01:10:48,884
Go ahead, call them.

862
01:10:48,918 --> 01:10:50,887
I'll be gone.

863
01:10:50,920 --> 01:10:52,121
They'll never catch me.

864
01:10:52,154 --> 01:10:54,457
And neither will you.

865
01:10:54,490 --> 01:10:56,559
Well I think I've got
somebody here that'll make you

866
01:10:56,592 --> 01:10:58,194
change your mind about that.

867
01:10:58,227 --> 01:10:59,563
Get in here fellas.

868
01:11:03,199 --> 01:11:05,634
Well, well, well.

869
01:11:10,439 --> 01:11:12,875
If it isn't little boy lost.

870
01:11:18,681 --> 01:11:22,018
How you doing in Vegas momma?

871
01:11:22,051 --> 01:11:24,020
It's a little hot for me.

872
01:11:24,053 --> 01:11:25,488
Nah.

873
01:11:25,521 --> 01:11:26,956
It's going to get hotter.

874
01:11:26,989 --> 01:11:28,258
Who are these guys?

875
01:11:28,291 --> 01:11:30,159
You didn't tell me
anything about this.

876
01:11:30,192 --> 01:11:32,529
Jason, meet Abdul.

877
01:11:32,562 --> 01:11:35,599
Second rate fighter,
a third rate hood.

878
01:11:38,434 --> 01:11:40,336
ABDUL: Pleasure.

879
01:11:40,369 --> 01:11:43,239
This changes nothing Marks.

880
01:11:43,272 --> 01:11:45,475
You can put a dozen of these
guys between me and the door,

881
01:11:45,508 --> 01:11:48,244
I'm still walking out of here.

882
01:11:48,277 --> 01:11:49,979
We'll see.

883
01:11:50,012 --> 01:11:51,381
This is crazy.

884
01:11:51,414 --> 01:11:53,483
Nah.

885
01:11:53,516 --> 01:11:57,020
It's going to get crazier.

886
01:11:57,053 --> 01:11:57,820
Run.

887
01:11:57,853 --> 01:11:59,256
Get the hell out of here.

888
01:12:03,326 --> 01:12:07,263
Get the hell out of here.

889
01:12:07,296 --> 01:12:10,667

01:12:14,236 --> 01:12:16,673
SHANE: No!

[gun shots]

893
01:12:25,514 --> 01:12:26,416
Aw man.

894
01:13:11,027 --> 01:13:12,996
[inaudible] drive faster, now.

895
01:13:13,029 --> 01:13:14,431
I'm going, I'm going.

896
01:13:23,005 --> 01:13:23,973
Aw yeah.

897
01:13:24,006 --> 01:13:25,475
Catch him up, damn it.

898
01:13:25,508 --> 01:13:26,409
Catch him!

899
01:13:52,501 --> 01:13:54,470
[inaudible]!

900
01:13:54,503 --> 01:13:55,405
Shoot him.

901
01:14:11,520 --> 01:14:15,424
[gun shots]

902
01:14:17,026 --> 01:14:20,930
[gun shots]

903
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:26,169
Slow down.

904
01:14:26,202 --> 01:14:26,969
[inaudible]

905
01:14:27,002 --> 01:14:27,904
I got you.

906
01:14:41,517 --> 01:14:45,422
[tires squealing]

907
01:14:56,532 --> 01:14:57,967
Don't worry.

908
01:14:58,000 --> 01:14:59,969
I won't hurt you that much.

909
01:15:00,002 --> 01:15:02,972
Thank you.

910
01:15:03,005 --> 01:15:04,974

[gun shots]

913
01:15:55,324 --> 01:15:57,293
Are you OK?

914
01:15:57,326 --> 01:15:58,695
They told me Jason was dead.

915
01:16:04,233 --> 01:16:15,211
[phone ringing]

916
01:16:15,244 --> 01:16:17,346
BENDER (ON PHONE): Is it done?

917
01:16:17,379 --> 01:16:18,548
Yeah.

918
01:16:18,581 --> 01:16:21,617
It's done you son of a bitch.

919
01:16:21,650 --> 01:16:23,419
I've got two of your
men down over here.

920
01:16:23,452 --> 01:16:24,921
Why don't you come and get them?

921
01:16:24,954 --> 01:16:26,756
I've got a better
idea hot shot.

922
01:16:26,789 --> 01:16:28,558
Why don't you come
here and just give up?

923
01:16:28,591 --> 01:16:29,926
No, no, no.

924
01:16:29,959 --> 01:16:32,428
Why would I do a
thing like that?

925
01:16:32,461 --> 01:16:33,629
ANGELIQUE (ON PHONE):
Help me Shane.

926
01:16:33,662 --> 01:16:35,998
He'll kill me.

927
01:16:36,031 --> 01:16:38,968
Please, help me.

928
01:16:39,001 --> 01:16:40,069
Tell you what.

929
01:16:40,102 --> 01:16:41,938
Lets just call a truce.

930
01:16:41,971 --> 01:16:43,339
You lost your friend.

931
01:16:43,372 --> 01:16:45,408
I've lost some friends.

932
01:16:45,441 --> 01:16:47,777
And let's just leave
it at that, all right?

933
01:16:47,810 --> 01:16:49,779
So what's the deal?

934
01:16:49,812 --> 01:16:51,480
I'll stop gunning
for you and I'll

935
01:16:51,513 --> 01:16:55,618
give you Angelique if you agree
to do one last bout for me.

936
01:16:55,651 --> 01:16:57,687
We'll split the take,
go our separate ways.

937
01:17:02,057 --> 01:17:03,259
All right.

938
01:17:03,292 --> 01:17:05,361
If that's what it's going
to take to end this,

939
01:17:05,394 --> 01:17:08,097
I'll see you in an hour.

940
01:17:08,130 --> 01:17:09,432
Here.

941
01:17:09,465 --> 01:17:11,334
I have a friend who
lives out by Hoover Dam.

942
01:17:11,367 --> 01:17:12,368
All right, that will do.

943
01:17:12,401 --> 01:17:13,903
You stay there until
you hear from me.

944
01:17:13,936 --> 01:17:14,871
What if I don't?

945
01:17:14,904 --> 01:17:16,638
You will.

946
01:17:16,672 --> 01:17:20,576
One way or another, you will.

947
01:17:20,609 --> 01:17:21,544
You know how to use this?

948
01:17:21,577 --> 01:17:22,345
Yeah.

949
01:17:22,378 --> 01:17:24,547
You taught me, remember?

950
01:17:24,580 --> 01:17:26,515
That's right.

951
01:17:26,548 --> 01:17:29,018
Look, we better get moving.

952
01:17:29,051 --> 01:17:30,518
Good luck.

953
01:17:30,552 --> 01:17:31,454
You too.

954
01:18:15,564 --> 01:18:18,301
Relax Mr McQuade.

955
01:18:18,334 --> 01:18:21,037
Tonight, you will make
us very much money.

956
01:18:21,070 --> 01:18:22,438
Yeah.

957
01:18:22,471 --> 01:18:25,473
Boy, the suckers really paid to
see a fugitive murder suspect

958
01:18:25,507 --> 01:18:28,143
fighting, on pay per view.

959
01:18:28,177 --> 01:18:30,913
What an angle.

960
01:18:30,946 --> 01:18:32,348
What about Angelique?

961
01:18:35,951 --> 01:18:40,056
Son, we have over a million
dollars in advance promotions.

962
01:18:40,089 --> 01:18:43,259
And that even counting
the side bets.

963
01:18:43,292 --> 01:18:45,593
You all right?

964
01:18:45,627 --> 01:18:48,064
Oh, she's fine.

965
01:18:48,097 --> 01:18:51,100
And ain't nobody
going to bother her

966
01:18:51,133 --> 01:18:53,502
as long as you're a good boy.

967
01:18:53,535 --> 01:18:57,139
Yeah, you are going
to be a good boy,

968
01:18:57,172 --> 01:18:59,607
aren't you Mr McQuade?

969
01:18:59,641 --> 01:19:03,178
I think Mr McQuade
has learned his lesson.

970
01:19:03,212 --> 01:19:05,013
He seems almost--

971
01:19:05,047 --> 01:19:05,748
Contrite.

972
01:19:09,752 --> 01:19:12,588
[laughter]

973
01:19:27,970 --> 01:19:29,638
Good evening.

974
01:19:29,671 --> 01:19:32,708
Tonight I'd like to say
welcome and thank you

975
01:19:32,741 --> 01:19:35,578
to all the beautiful
memories of our exclusive,

976
01:19:35,611 --> 01:19:38,647
closed circuit pay
per view system.

977
01:19:38,680 --> 01:19:41,851
For tonight, I'm
going to bring to you

978
01:19:41,884 --> 01:19:44,587
a most awesome
spectacle, unavailable

979
01:19:44,620 --> 01:19:45,822
from your local cable operator.

980
01:19:48,457 --> 01:19:53,963
You see, a week ago, in
another ring in Hong Kong,

981
01:19:53,996 --> 01:19:57,867
in the aftermath,
two men lie dead.

982
01:19:57,900 --> 01:20:01,337
And what is the cause?

983
01:20:01,370 --> 01:20:05,241
Shane McQuade,
formerly of Hong Kong,

984
01:20:05,274 --> 01:20:08,677
and currently
Interpol's most wanted.

985
01:20:08,710 --> 01:20:13,215
Tonight, he's rematched against
the same fighter he faced

986
01:20:13,248 --> 01:20:17,319
and defeated before
that bloody massacre.

987
01:20:17,352 --> 01:20:22,124
I'm talking about the Moroccan
public enemy number one,

988
01:20:22,157 --> 01:20:26,595
until he found a
hobby, kickboxing.

989
01:20:26,628 --> 01:20:28,965
The dreaded Abdul Sabbah!

990
01:21:05,601 --> 01:21:07,203
Tonight's the night.

991
01:21:07,236 --> 01:21:08,137
Yeah it is.

992
01:21:25,821 --> 01:21:28,424
This time, it's for real.

993
01:22:04,626 --> 01:22:05,328
Huzzah!

994
01:23:24,473 --> 01:23:25,174
All right!

995
01:23:32,247 --> 01:23:33,915
Uh huh.

996
01:23:33,949 --> 01:23:34,650
Yeah.

997
01:24:10,686 --> 01:24:14,090
[bell rings]

998
01:24:22,164 --> 01:24:22,865
What the hell is this?

999
01:24:25,634 --> 01:24:26,335
[inaudible].

1000
01:24:33,408 --> 01:24:36,344
Yeah

1001
01:24:36,378 --> 01:24:40,115
This is stupid Abdul.

1002
01:24:40,148 --> 01:24:41,884
Are you a fighter or a killer?

1003
01:24:41,917 --> 01:24:45,219
We're both killers.

1004
01:24:45,253 --> 01:24:46,422
If I win--

1005
01:24:46,455 --> 01:24:47,990
If you win, they're going
to throw you in the ring

1006
01:24:48,023 --> 01:24:50,159
with another killer.

1007
01:24:50,192 --> 01:24:51,626
These people are maniacs!

1008
01:24:54,696 --> 01:24:56,098
This has got to end.

1009
01:24:59,701 --> 01:25:01,603
There's only one
way for this to end.

1010
01:25:04,673 --> 01:25:08,577
[sound of swords clanging]

1011
01:25:42,611 --> 01:25:43,512
And now you die.

1012
01:26:04,566 --> 01:26:08,471
[sound of sword falling]

1013
01:26:22,184 --> 01:26:23,519
It's all over now.

1014
01:26:23,552 --> 01:26:24,319
It's finished.

1015
01:26:24,352 --> 01:26:25,587
This is the end.

1016
01:26:25,620 --> 01:26:26,322
Finito.

1017
01:26:37,065 --> 01:26:40,602
[gun shots]

1018
01:26:41,503 --> 01:26:44,840
[gun shot]

1019
01:26:48,376 --> 01:26:51,847
Get that helicopter here now.

1020
01:26:51,880 --> 01:26:52,748
They're on their way.

1021
01:26:56,651 --> 01:26:58,387
You've done well.

1022
01:26:58,420 --> 01:27:02,024
You've earned your half.

1023
01:27:02,057 --> 01:27:02,925
Half.

1024
01:27:02,958 --> 01:27:04,826
You're kidding, right?

1025
01:27:04,860 --> 01:27:07,329
Go ahead, take it all kid.

1026
01:27:07,362 --> 01:27:10,232
But remember, you'll be
looking over your shoulder

1027
01:27:10,265 --> 01:27:12,834
for the rest of your life.

1028
01:27:12,868 --> 01:27:15,003
How do you know I'm even
going to let you live?

1029
01:27:15,036 --> 01:27:17,439
[gun cocking]

1030
01:27:17,472 --> 01:27:19,074
I'm a killer.

1031
01:27:19,107 --> 01:27:23,145
You are a killer Mr
McQuade, and a talented one.

1032
01:27:23,178 --> 01:27:25,747
But, not of the cold
blooded variety.

1033
01:27:25,780 --> 01:27:28,984
Two old men, unarmed?

1034
01:27:29,017 --> 01:27:29,818
No.

1035
01:27:29,851 --> 01:27:32,888
You won't do it.

1036
01:27:32,921 --> 01:27:35,356
[gun cocks]

1037
01:27:35,390 --> 01:27:38,826
[laughter]

1038
01:27:38,860 --> 01:27:40,395
Good luck kid.

1039
01:27:40,428 --> 01:27:44,366
Until we meet again.

1040
01:27:44,399 --> 01:27:48,268
[gun shot]

1041
01:27:51,339 --> 01:27:54,810
[gun shot]

1042
01:27:54,843 --> 01:27:57,213
[gun shots]

1043
01:27:59,314 --> 01:28:02,183
[dogs barking]

1044
01:28:29,344 --> 01:28:31,780
Shane.

1045
01:28:31,813 --> 01:28:33,782
What happened to you?

1046
01:28:33,815 --> 01:28:37,719
I killed a few people.

1047
01:28:37,752 --> 01:28:38,754
This is for you.

1048
01:28:38,787 --> 01:28:40,355
I don't think so.

1049
01:28:40,388 --> 01:28:41,557
Uh uh.

1050
01:28:41,590 --> 01:28:43,792
See, I tailed your ass
all the way from the arena

1051
01:28:43,825 --> 01:28:48,196
because I knew your hands
would touch that dough.

1052
01:28:48,229 --> 01:28:49,698
All a set up, right?

1053
01:28:49,731 --> 01:28:51,900
Right from the start.

1054
01:28:51,933 --> 01:28:54,169
You're a sweet guy Shane.

1055
01:28:54,202 --> 01:28:56,905
Not too smart.

1056
01:28:56,938 --> 01:28:58,340
Yeah, I've heard that.

1057
01:29:01,176 --> 01:29:01,877
You want the money?

1058
01:29:05,046 --> 01:29:05,814
Here.

1059
01:29:05,847 --> 01:29:06,715
Here it is.

1060
01:29:30,705 --> 01:29:32,541
Sorry Shane.

1061
01:29:32,574 --> 01:29:34,910
I had to play along until now.

1062
01:29:34,943 --> 01:29:36,078
But it's all over now.

1063
01:29:36,111 --> 01:29:37,313
We can go away together
with the money.

1064
01:29:42,384 --> 01:29:43,652
Forget about her.

1065
01:29:43,685 --> 01:29:45,520
She's the past.

1066
01:29:45,553 --> 01:29:46,488
I'm your future.

1067
01:29:46,521 --> 01:29:48,824
I don't think so.

1068
01:29:48,857 --> 01:29:50,692
You said I wasn't very smart.

1069
01:29:50,725 --> 01:29:52,526
Maybe you were right.

1070
01:29:52,560 --> 01:29:53,328
I didn't mean it.

1071
01:29:53,361 --> 01:29:54,396
I was just kidding.

1072
01:29:54,429 --> 01:29:57,699
I'm smart enough to
stay away from you.

1073
01:29:57,732 --> 01:30:00,235
Take a walk Angelique.

1074
01:30:00,268 --> 01:30:01,336
Take a fist full of money.

1075
01:30:01,369 --> 01:30:02,137
Hell, take it all.

1076
01:30:02,170 --> 01:30:05,540
Just go away.

1077
01:30:05,573 --> 01:30:07,441
Uh uh.

1078
01:30:07,475 --> 01:30:10,212
It doesn't work
that way lover boy.

1079
01:30:10,245 --> 01:30:15,417
If you don't come with me
now, you don't go anywhere.

1080
01:30:15,450 --> 01:30:20,889
What can I say, I don't
handle rejection very well.

1081
01:30:20,922 --> 01:30:21,823
Drop the gun.

1082
01:30:24,893 --> 01:30:27,796
[gun shot]

1083
01:30:29,864 --> 01:30:33,268
[gun shot]

1084
01:31:12,107 --> 01:31:14,076
Well.

1085
01:31:14,109 --> 01:31:16,611
I guess it's goodbye again.

1086
01:31:16,644 --> 01:31:19,748
What if I want
to come with you?

1087
01:31:19,781 --> 01:31:20,749
No you don't.

1088
01:31:20,782 --> 01:31:23,152
You need a chance to start over.

1089
01:31:26,421 --> 01:31:27,088
We could start over.

1090
01:31:30,725 --> 01:31:31,727
Shane, I could have got her.

1091
01:31:31,760 --> 01:31:33,028
Why did you stop me?

1092
01:31:38,399 --> 01:31:41,136
A week ago, I killed a man.

1093
01:31:41,169 --> 01:31:42,170
I broke his neck.

1094
01:31:42,203 --> 01:31:46,107
And since then, once
you kill someone,

1095
01:31:46,141 --> 01:31:49,311
your whole world changes.

1096
01:31:49,344 --> 01:31:50,045
You change.

1097
01:31:57,152 --> 01:31:59,454
You were always right.

1098
01:31:59,487 --> 01:32:00,889
You were always late.

1099
01:32:34,489 --> 01:32:37,159

01:32:50,471 --> 01:32:52,941
