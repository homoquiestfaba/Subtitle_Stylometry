1
00:03:55,780 --> 00:03:58,374  X1:148 X2:560 Y1:498 Y2:530
Mr. Lombardo, what's up?

2
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:16,451  X1:161 X2:548 Y1:498 Y2:530
Did you see those eyes?

3
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:38,528  X1:283 X2:423 Y1:498 Y2:524
Fuck off!

4
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:42,010  X1:071 X2:636 Y1:498 Y2:530
I appreciate you guys coming down.

5
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:44,455  X1:153 X2:557 Y1:498 Y2:530
All I'm going to miss is...

6
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:49,855  X1:257 X2:452 Y1:498 Y2:524
Settle down.

7
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:56,573  X1:097 X2:614 Y1:450 Y2:524
We've come to the halfway point
of our senior seminars.

8
00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:03,850  X1:123 X2:588 Y1:450 Y2:524
- Beats study hall, doesn't it?
- No!

9
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:08,616  X1:122 X2:587 Y1:450 Y2:530
- That you, Jimmy?
- In study hall I can meditate.

10
00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:14,935  X1:084 X2:625 Y1:450 Y2:530
- He means masturbate.
- I'm sure you know all about that.

11
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:43,211  X1:207 X2:498 Y1:498 Y2:529
It wasn't me, man !

12
00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:49,370  X1:089 X2:619 Y1:450 Y2:530
We've all heard the terms
"date rape", "sexual harassment".

13
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:53,888  X1:140 X2:569 Y1:450 Y2:524
We've discussed
some of these issues here.

14
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:58,292  X1:097 X2:613 Y1:450 Y2:530
Our guests today come from
the Blue Bay Police Department.

15
00:05:58,460 --> 00:06:06,538  X1:098 X2:614 Y1:450 Y2:530
Detectives Duquette and Perez
will give us a fresh perspective -

16
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:13,492  X1:091 X2:615 Y1:450 Y2:530
- and address your questions.
Let's give them a warm welcome.

17
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:21,258  X1:139 X2:570 Y1:450 Y2:530
I'm out of here.
This prick can kiss my ass.

18
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:36,329  X1:084 X2:626 Y1:450 Y2:530
As I was saying... We'll start with
a question. What is a sex crime?

19
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:39,776  X1:229 X2:477 Y1:498 Y2:530
Not getting any.

20
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:49,732  X1:157 X2:548 Y1:450 Y2:530
Blue Bay, fight, fight!
Buccaneers, win tonight!

21
00:07:03,940 --> 00:07:06,249  X1:296 X2:413 Y1:498 Y2:530
Steady.

22
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:14,212  X1:166 X2:542 Y1:498 Y2:530
Steady the bow, Jimmy.

23
00:07:14,380 --> 00:07:17,258  X1:258 X2:452 Y1:498 Y2:530
That's good.

24
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:28,610  X1:107 X2:599 Y1:450 Y2:530
Drop the main. All right, de-rig,
and I'll see you all Monday.

25
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:35,892  X1:090 X2:620 Y1:450 Y2:530
The Buccaneers are number one,
and don't you forget it.

26
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:45,250  X1:063 X2:646 Y1:450 Y2:530
- Good work, guys. See you Monday.
- See you, Mr. Lombardo.

27
00:07:56,340 --> 00:07:59,650  X1:113 X2:594 Y1:450 Y2:530
All right!
I could definitely party on that.

28
00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:08,417  X1:086 X2:624 Y1:450 Y2:530
That's a stinkpot, Jimmy.
A real boatman gets one of those.

29
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:13,890  X1:154 X2:552 Y1:498 Y2:524
Now... that's a real boat.

30
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:20,769  X1:087 X2:625 Y1:450 Y2:530
Thank you for getting me into this
class. My old man wouldn't pay.

31
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:24,899  X1:151 X2:558 Y1:450 Y2:530
You're working for it.
And learning about boats.

32
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:29,053  X1:134 X2:575 Y1:450 Y2:530
I put myself through college
working boats.

33
00:08:30,220 --> 00:08:34,498  X1:187 X2:524 Y1:450 Y2:530
Can I play too?
Or is it just for boys?

34
00:08:36,780 --> 00:08:43,572  X1:095 X2:616 Y1:450 Y2:524
So, who's washing your jeep this
weekend? The senior car wash !

35
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:47,335  X1:162 X2:546 Y1:450 Y2:524
- That's a waste of time.
- Not at all.

36
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:51,937  X1:093 X2:618 Y1:450 Y2:530
- How about if Nicole and I do it?
- Tell you what...

37
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:57,458  X1:079 X2:629 Y1:450 Y2:530
I'm going to the Glades, Saturday.
On Sunday, you wash the mud off.

38
00:08:57,620 --> 00:08:59,690  X1:314 X2:393 Y1:498 Y2:524
Deal.

39
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:04,376  X1:059 X2:647 Y1:450 Y2:524
My mom should give me a ride today,
but she's not here.

40
00:09:04,540 --> 00:09:08,419  X1:152 X2:558 Y1:450 Y2:530
So I was wondering
if you could give me one?

41
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:14,257  X1:109 X2:602 Y1:450 Y2:530
You wouldn't want me to walk?
Something bad might happen.

42
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:20,649  X1:159 X2:551 Y1:450 Y2:530
- You need a lift, Jimbo?
- Yes, but I got my bike.

43
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:23,618  X1:220 X2:487 Y1:498 Y2:530
Hey, no problem.

44
00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:37,129  X1:309 X2:401 Y1:498 Y2:530
Try it.

45
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:43,495  X1:177 X2:533 Y1:450 Y2:530
Suzie, you need a lift?
We've got room.

46
00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:48,780  X1:058 X2:652 Y1:450 Y2:524
Jesus! Where did she get the shoes?
"Whores-for-less?"

47
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:53,375  X1:260 X2:449 Y1:498 Y2:530
Try it again.

48
00:09:57,260 --> 00:10:00,058  X1:081 X2:625 Y1:498 Y2:530
Nice to see you kids getting along.

49
00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:43,417  X1:180 X2:529 Y1:450 Y2:524
- Don't forget Sunday.
- I won't.

50
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:49,012  X1:158 X2:553 Y1:450 Y2:529
- Is that Sam Lombardo?
- Hi, Mom !

51
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:53,492  X1:253 X2:455 Y1:450 Y2:529
- Sam ! Hi.
- Hi, Sandra.

52
00:10:55,260 --> 00:11:00,414  X1:065 X2:646 Y1:450 Y2:530
- Why don't you come in for a drink?
- Sorry, Sandra, I've got to run.

53
00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:15,580  X1:199 X2:509 Y1:450 Y2:530
- Hi, Mr. Lombardo.
- Hi, girls.

54
00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:19,175  X1:199 X2:509 Y1:450 Y2:530
- Hi, Mr. Lombardo.
- Hi, girls.

55
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:24,016  X1:092 X2:616 Y1:450 Y2:530
- Look, he forgot. I knew it.
- No, I didn't. Check out my jeep.

56
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:29,254  X1:082 X2:625 Y1:450 Y2:524
Nice and dirty.
But wait until the other car leaves.

57
00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:33,379  X1:115 X2:597 Y1:450 Y2:530
You mean
the Mercedes isn't yours, too?

58
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:36,771  X1:176 X2:534 Y1:450 Y2:529
My Benz is blue.
You know that, Nicole.

59
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:42,333  X1:063 X2:648 Y1:450 Y2:530
- Sam, I'm leaving.
- Where's your hose, Mr. Lombardo?

60
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:46,652  X1:183 X2:524 Y1:450 Y2:530
The hose, Kelly,
is in front of the jeep.

61
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:54,049  X1:157 X2:554 Y1:450 Y2:530
Kelly Van Ryan's
going to wash your jeep?

62
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:57,735  X1:187 X2:519 Y1:450 Y2:530
Come on, Barbara.
It's for a good cause.

63
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:04,770  X1:107 X2:601 Y1:450 Y2:530
- Sam the Philanthropist!
- Hard work never hurt anyone.

64
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:11,497  X1:189 X2:518 Y1:498 Y2:524
Have fun at the club.

65
00:14:11,340 --> 00:14:14,537  X1:215 X2:492 Y1:498 Y2:524
Looks brand new.

66
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:18,813  X1:096 X2:616 Y1:498 Y2:530
Aren't you forgetting something?

67
00:14:18,980 --> 00:14:23,337  X1:091 X2:618 Y1:450 Y2:530
- Your coupon. We got to have it.
- Yeah, that thing.

68
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:27,698  X1:095 X2:614 Y1:450 Y2:529
- Can't we just...
- Rules are rules, Mr. Lombardo.

69
00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:32,775  X1:071 X2:637 Y1:450 Y2:524
- Okay, let me look for it...
- Mr. Lombardo? We're kind of late.

70
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:37,058  X1:106 X2:603 Y1:450 Y2:530
Nicole can go ahead. You can
give me a ride when you find it.

71
00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:41,372  X1:175 X2:534 Y1:498 Y2:530
Just give me a minute.

72
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:51,298  X1:232 X2:479 Y1:450 Y2:530
- Go!
- Are you sure?

73
00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:04,294  X1:215 X2:490 Y1:498 Y2:524
Frankie! Oh God !

74
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:11,050  X1:257 X2:450 Y1:498 Y2:524
Goddamn it!

75
00:16:11,540 --> 00:16:17,376  X1:074 X2:638 Y1:450 Y2:530
This is Blue Bay High School. Your
son or daughter was absent today.

76
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:23,095  X1:278 X2:430 Y1:450 Y2:524
What?
Come on !

77
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:29,096  X1:135 X2:574 Y1:450 Y2:524
- That's a hell of a fish, Art.
- It's a barracuda.

78
00:16:29,260 --> 00:16:35,096  X1:063 X2:645 Y1:450 Y2:530
If you weren't chasing booty at the
club you could have caught one, too.

79
00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:39,014  X1:137 X2:573 Y1:450 Y2:530
- You're not going to eat it?
- Why not?

80
00:16:39,180 --> 00:16:44,937  X1:097 X2:612 Y1:450 Y2:530
- They're poisonous. It'll kill you.
- Like most of the girls you date.

81
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:47,136  X1:137 X2:572 Y1:498 Y2:530
Sandra Van Ryan, for Sam.

82
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:57,368  X1:124 X2:584 Y1:450 Y2:530
- What's up?
- Kelly skipped school today.

83
00:16:57,540 --> 00:17:01,579  X1:136 X2:574 Y1:450 Y2:524
- Have you heard anything?
- Not a word.

84
00:17:02,580 --> 00:17:07,051  X1:161 X2:546 Y1:498 Y2:529
Never mind, I found her.

85
00:17:10,060 --> 00:17:12,130  X1:318 X2:387 Y1:498 Y2:524
Pull !

86
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:15,656  X1:119 X2:587 Y1:450 Y2:530
Listen, Sam...
It was really good seeing you.

87
00:17:15,820 --> 00:17:19,369  X1:123 X2:584 Y1:450 Y2:530
Look Sandra,
I'm real busy right now, so...

88
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:24,568  X1:095 X2:613 Y1:450 Y2:530
I haven't found anyone who can
handle my boat the way you can.

89
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:31,499  X1:068 X2:641 Y1:450 Y2:530
- You're fucking Barbara. So what?
- Maybe I'm a one-woman man now.

90
00:17:31,660 --> 00:17:35,972  X1:271 X2:436 Y1:498 Y2:524
Poor Sam.

91
00:17:36,140 --> 00:17:39,337  X1:079 X2:632 Y1:450 Y2:530
You really think a Blue Bay woman
will marry you?

92
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:42,697  X1:181 X2:526 Y1:450 Y2:530
- Are you finished?
- Grab a clue, Honey.

93
00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:48,173  X1:102 X2:608 Y1:450 Y2:530
You're a hired hand, a good lay,
that's all. Enjoy it while it lasts.

94
00:17:48,340 --> 00:17:50,251  X1:253 X2:454 Y1:498 Y2:530
Bye, Sandra.

95
00:17:51,860 --> 00:17:54,613  X1:318 X2:387 Y1:498 Y2:524
Pull !

96
00:17:55,980 --> 00:18:02,010  X1:076 X2:633 Y1:450 Y2:530
You seem to find guns therapeutic.
Maybe I ought to try it.

97
00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:08,611  X1:072 X2:634 Y1:450 Y2:530
Let me guess. Some boy didn't call,
and screwed up your weekend?

98
00:18:08,780 --> 00:18:11,613  X1:131 X2:577 Y1:498 Y2:530
So you're taking the day off.

99
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:20,777  X1:076 X2:634 Y1:450 Y2:524
- Which of your deckhands is that?
- Whichever one I want.

100
00:18:22,340 --> 00:18:26,015  X1:203 X2:508 Y1:450 Y2:524
Okay, Kelly.
What's the matter?

101
00:18:28,780 --> 00:18:31,772  X1:269 X2:443 Y1:498 Y2:524
What is it?

102
00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:36,377  X1:253 X2:456 Y1:450 Y2:524
- I miss Dad.
- Jesus.

103
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:42,376  X1:126 X2:582 Y1:450 Y2:530
- I miss him too. Sometimes.
- No, you don't.

104
00:18:42,540 --> 00:18:46,772  X1:124 X2:582 Y1:450 Y2:530
He didn't have to kill himself,
Kelly.

105
00:18:47,540 --> 00:18:50,771  X1:295 X2:412 Y1:498 Y2:530
Kelly...

106
00:18:53,740 --> 00:18:56,777  X1:328 X2:379 Y1:498 Y2:524
I...

107
00:18:56,940 --> 00:19:00,933  X1:148 X2:559 Y1:498 Y2:530
I don't know why he did it.

108
00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:05,256  X1:252 X2:455 Y1:498 Y2:530
I really don't.

109
00:19:08,860 --> 00:19:11,977  X1:290 X2:418 Y1:498 Y2:524
Can l...

110
00:19:13,340 --> 00:19:17,731  X1:166 X2:545 Y1:450 Y2:530
Can I get you anything?
Do you want a valium?

111
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:27,298  X1:096 X2:613 Y1:450 Y2:530
- I was raped.
- What, Honey? I can't hear you.

112
00:19:27,460 --> 00:19:32,409  X1:197 X2:512 Y1:450 Y2:524
- I said I was raped.
- What?

113
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:37,451  X1:241 X2:465 Y1:498 Y2:530
I was raped...

114
00:19:37,620 --> 00:19:41,295  X1:185 X2:522 Y1:498 Y2:530
... by Sam Lombardo.

115
00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:43,651  X1:226 X2:485 Y1:498 Y2:524
Sam Lombardo?

116
00:19:45,420 --> 00:19:51,177  X1:067 X2:644 Y1:450 Y2:530
- My daughter does not get raped !
- And you say Sam Lombardo did it?

117
00:19:51,340 --> 00:19:56,130  X1:079 X2:633 Y1:450 Y2:524
That son of a bitch must be insane
to think he can do this to me.

118
00:19:56,300 --> 00:20:01,533  X1:072 X2:638 Y1:450 Y2:530
We understand your feelings,
but we need some time with Kelly, -

119
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:05,249  X1:120 X2:589 Y1:498 Y2:524
- to take her statement alone.

120
00:20:07,820 --> 00:20:11,654  X1:084 X2:626 Y1:450 Y2:524
- Are you all right with this, Baby?
- Yeah.

121
00:20:21,740 --> 00:20:25,335  X1:114 X2:598 Y1:450 Y2:524
Would you like to take a break
for a minute?

122
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:28,617  X1:123 X2:583 Y1:498 Y2:530
I just want to get it over with.

123
00:20:28,780 --> 00:20:33,934  X1:085 X2:624 Y1:450 Y2:530
We'd like to video your statement.
These are serious charges.

124
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:39,379  X1:111 X2:600 Y1:450 Y2:530
We must know everything
that happened. Are you ready?

125
00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:52,612  X1:091 X2:616 Y1:498 Y2:530
He started rubbing my shoulders.

126
00:20:55,180 --> 00:21:00,459  X1:162 X2:546 Y1:450 Y2:530
I let him.
I mean, he's a nice guy.

127
00:21:00,620 --> 00:21:03,009  X1:222 X2:482 Y1:498 Y2:530
The next thing...

128
00:21:03,180 --> 00:21:07,492  X1:118 X2:590 Y1:498 Y2:530
... his hand was in my shorts.

129
00:21:07,660 --> 00:21:11,414  X1:165 X2:539 Y1:498 Y2:529
You know, from behind.

130
00:21:11,580 --> 00:21:14,538  X1:246 X2:461 Y1:498 Y2:530
His fingers...

131
00:21:16,220 --> 00:21:21,248  X1:217 X2:490 Y1:450 Y2:530
- His fingers...
- Take your time.

132
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:26,818  X1:165 X2:547 Y1:450 Y2:530
They were in me.
Both places, you know?

133
00:21:28,780 --> 00:21:34,412  X1:099 X2:613 Y1:450 Y2:524
- Did he put himself inside you?
- Yes.

134
00:21:34,580 --> 00:21:40,132  X1:084 X2:622 Y1:450 Y2:530
I said "stop", I screamed. I mean,
that's how it sounded in my head.

135
00:21:41,260 --> 00:21:45,492  X1:150 X2:562 Y1:450 Y2:530
- He hurt me.
- Did you try to fight him?

136
00:21:45,660 --> 00:21:52,293  X1:084 X2:624 Y1:450 Y2:524
- He pinned my wrists behind me.
- Then what?

137
00:21:52,460 --> 00:21:57,659  X1:118 X2:592 Y1:450 Y2:530
He kept saying,
"Let it happen, let it happen. "

138
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:03,976  X1:136 X2:572 Y1:450 Y2:529
- And then he just stopped.
- You mean, he withdrew?

139
00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:09,498  X1:114 X2:593 Y1:450 Y2:530
- It's really hard to remember.
- Try, Kelly.

140
00:22:14,540 --> 00:22:17,657  X1:153 X2:554 Y1:450 Y2:524
I know one thing he said.
He said:

141
00:22:17,820 --> 00:22:21,495  X1:132 X2:579 Y1:498 Y2:530
"Don't worry, I didn't come. "

142
00:22:21,660 --> 00:22:25,130  X1:212 X2:496 Y1:498 Y2:530
I can't forget that.

143
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:29,896  X1:108 X2:606 Y1:450 Y2:524
He said, "No little girl can ever
make me come. "

144
00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:36,449  X1:165 X2:542 Y1:450 Y2:524
"No little girl can ever
make me come." Jesus!

145
00:22:36,620 --> 00:22:41,410  X1:132 X2:579 Y1:450 Y2:530
Too bad, we might have had
some physical evidence.

146
00:22:42,860 --> 00:22:48,093  X1:074 X2:635 Y1:450 Y2:530
Maybe there's no physical evidence
because nothing happened.

147
00:22:48,260 --> 00:22:51,411  X1:199 X2:507 Y1:498 Y2:530
I think she's acting.

148
00:22:51,580 --> 00:22:56,813  X1:074 X2:635 Y1:450 Y2:524
She set it up to be alone with him,
so he could come on. But he didn't.

149
00:22:56,980 --> 00:23:01,895  X1:120 X2:589 Y1:450 Y2:524
Maybe, maybe not. He should
never have had her out there.

150
00:23:02,060 --> 00:23:05,097  X1:167 X2:542 Y1:450 Y2:530
Gloria, he's done half
the women in Blue Bay.

151
00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:09,856  X1:104 X2:605 Y1:450 Y2:530
That doesn't make him a rapist.
She could take a polygraph.

152
00:23:10,020 --> 00:23:13,490  X1:068 X2:641 Y1:450 Y2:530
And the Pope could take a piss test.
This is Blue Bay.

153
00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:18,290  X1:103 X2:606 Y1:450 Y2:530
Ask a Van Ryan for that
and Tom Baxter will cut you off.

154
00:23:18,460 --> 00:23:22,738  X1:089 X2:623 Y1:450 Y2:530
You're afraid of Tom Baxter now?
Or Sandra Van Ryan?

155
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:27,815  X1:081 X2:626 Y1:450 Y2:530
Talk to his neighbours,
his co-workers and Kelly's friends.

156
00:23:27,980 --> 00:23:33,930  X1:097 X2:611 Y1:450 Y2:530
- This will destroy Lombardo.
- You heard her. The guy's dirty.

157
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:37,092  X1:221 X2:486 Y1:498 Y2:530
Bring me a case.

158
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:30,811  X1:197 X2:509 Y1:450 Y2:530
Good work, Jimbo.
I'll see you Monday.

159
00:24:37,580 --> 00:24:41,414  X1:202 X2:506 Y1:450 Y2:530
That's what's left
of my sailing class.

160
00:24:43,420 --> 00:24:49,859  X1:109 X2:599 Y1:450 Y2:530
- Talk to me, Artie.
- Kelly is accusing you of rape.

161
00:24:50,020 --> 00:24:54,855  X1:070 X2:640 Y1:450 Y2:530
Jimmy told me.
Apparently I'm the last one to know.

162
00:24:55,020 --> 00:25:02,256  X1:078 X2:631 Y1:450 Y2:530
Sandra Van Ryan has been ringing
every member of the school board.

163
00:25:02,420 --> 00:25:07,733  X1:103 X2:606 Y1:450 Y2:530
- She's pushing for suspension.
- And they won't hear my side?

164
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:11,370  X1:154 X2:552 Y1:450 Y2:530
This is insane.
I'm innocent, goddammit!

165
00:25:11,540 --> 00:25:15,169  X1:137 X2:571 Y1:450 Y2:530
- You've got to believe that.
- Just hang in there.

166
00:25:15,340 --> 00:25:19,936  X1:127 X2:581 Y1:450 Y2:530
- When they clear you...
- You never get clear of this.

167
00:25:21,460 --> 00:25:26,409  X1:122 X2:584 Y1:450 Y2:530
It stays with you.
It follows you around forever.

168
00:25:27,580 --> 00:25:32,335  X1:052 X2:657 Y1:450 Y2:530
You're going to need some help, Sam.
An attorney.

169
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:38,575  X1:079 X2:633 Y1:450 Y2:530
And what attorney in South Florida
will go up against the Van Ryans?

170
00:25:54,940 --> 00:25:58,535  X1:098 X2:608 Y1:498 Y2:524
Hi. I'm here to see Ken Bowden.

171
00:25:58,700 --> 00:26:04,775  X1:107 X2:604 Y1:450 Y2:529
- Do you have an appointment?
- Yeah, Sam Lombardo.

172
00:26:04,940 --> 00:26:09,172  X1:093 X2:616 Y1:450 Y2:530
- Mr. Bowden, your 1 0:30's here.
- Show him in, please.

173
00:26:11,980 --> 00:26:14,016  X1:174 X2:537 Y1:498 Y2:530
What brings you here?

174
00:26:14,180 --> 00:26:20,938  X1:070 X2:639 Y1:450 Y2:530
Until yesterday, I was a guidance
counsellor at Blue Bay High School.

175
00:26:21,740 --> 00:26:26,609  X1:076 X2:633 Y1:450 Y2:524
- A student is accusing me of rape.
- Male or female?

176
00:26:28,060 --> 00:26:33,214  X1:110 X2:600 Y1:450 Y2:529
The student is Kelly Van Ryan.
Which means, I'm fucked.

177
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:40,615  X1:096 X2:614 Y1:450 Y2:530
- Why don't you tell me about it?
- Shit, where do I begin?

178
00:26:40,780 --> 00:26:45,296  X1:115 X2:594 Y1:498 Y2:530
Your relationship with the girl.

179
00:26:46,380 --> 00:26:50,578  X1:112 X2:596 Y1:450 Y2:530
She's a student, I was her
guidance counsellor, that's all.

180
00:26:51,660 --> 00:26:55,369  X1:165 X2:545 Y1:450 Y2:530
Then you've got nothing
to worry about.

181
00:26:56,780 --> 00:27:02,776  X1:105 X2:605 Y1:450 Y2:524
- What happened to your neck?
- This? I don't have to wear it.

182
00:27:05,580 --> 00:27:10,210  X1:131 X2:582 Y1:450 Y2:524
There was an insurance guy
around earlier.

183
00:27:10,380 --> 00:27:13,133  X1:124 X2:582 Y1:498 Y2:530
Let me tell you how I charge.

184
00:27:20,620 --> 00:27:23,009  X1:177 X2:531 Y1:450 Y2:530
Georgie!
How's the wind today?

185
00:27:23,180 --> 00:27:26,809  X1:152 X2:555 Y1:450 Y2:530
Mr. Lombardo, I'm afraid
I can't park for you today.

186
00:27:26,980 --> 00:27:29,210  X1:113 X2:594 Y1:498 Y2:530
I'm meeting Barbara for lunch.

187
00:27:34,460 --> 00:27:39,773  X1:120 X2:591 Y1:450 Y2:530
- Can you park this, Georgie?
- Right away, Mr. Baxter.

188
00:27:40,540 --> 00:27:44,931  X1:100 X2:610 Y1:450 Y2:524
You're finished here, Lombardo.
Take a hike.

189
00:27:49,180 --> 00:27:53,014  X1:148 X2:561 Y1:498 Y2:530
Barbara, what's going on?

190
00:27:55,860 --> 00:28:01,890  X1:056 X2:650 Y1:450 Y2:530
Maybe you didn't hear me, Lombardo.
You're finished in Blue Bay.

191
00:28:02,060 --> 00:28:07,259  X1:119 X2:588 Y1:450 Y2:530
If you see my daughter again,
you'll be finished, period.

192
00:28:07,420 --> 00:28:12,130  X1:147 X2:562 Y1:450 Y2:530
- Get the fuck out of here.
- Mr. Lombardo, please...

193
00:28:15,980 --> 00:28:19,177  X1:191 X2:515 Y1:498 Y2:530
It's all right, George.

194
00:28:40,020 --> 00:28:43,490  X1:132 X2:575 Y1:450 Y2:530
Sam, Honey!
Haven't seen you in a while.

195
00:28:43,660 --> 00:28:47,539  X1:222 X2:487 Y1:450 Y2:524
- Welcome back.
- Rum and coke.

196
00:30:13,540 --> 00:30:18,216  X1:207 X2:504 Y1:450 Y2:524
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine.

197
00:30:18,380 --> 00:30:21,099  X1:121 X2:589 Y1:498 Y2:529
That's too bad, motherfucker.

198
00:30:33,100 --> 00:30:35,978  X1:310 X2:401 Y1:498 Y2:524
Sam?

199
00:30:39,860 --> 00:30:42,772  X1:267 X2:442 Y1:498 Y2:524
Lombardo?

200
00:31:02,060 --> 00:31:05,575  X1:258 X2:451 Y1:450 Y2:524
Whoa, man !
It's me.

201
00:31:05,740 --> 00:31:09,335  X1:080 X2:629 Y1:450 Y2:530
Sorry, man.
Things have been a bit weird here.

202
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:12,458  X1:241 X2:466 Y1:498 Y2:524
I can see that.

203
00:31:12,620 --> 00:31:15,134  X1:259 X2:450 Y1:498 Y2:524
Come on in.

204
00:31:17,300 --> 00:31:21,896  X1:107 X2:604 Y1:450 Y2:530
You're sure this Frankie Condo
is the guy that did it?

205
00:31:22,060 --> 00:31:26,053  X1:145 X2:562 Y1:450 Y2:530
It was him. He was driving
Sandra's Range Rover.

206
00:31:26,220 --> 00:31:29,530  X1:127 X2:584 Y1:450 Y2:530
Tell the cops, and we can go
after Sandra Van Ryan.

207
00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:33,693  X1:126 X2:582 Y1:450 Y2:530
- Forget it.
- The lady has deep pockets.

208
00:31:33,860 --> 00:31:40,413  X1:078 X2:629 Y1:450 Y2:530
I know how deep her pockets are.
I thought I might save my house...

209
00:31:40,580 --> 00:31:44,459  X1:110 X2:599 Y1:450 Y2:524
But guess who's on the
board of directors at the bank?

210
00:31:44,620 --> 00:31:50,297  X1:077 X2:630 Y1:450 Y2:530
I don't need more trouble from her.
Do you think I can stop her?

211
00:31:50,460 --> 00:31:54,214  X1:133 X2:578 Y1:450 Y2:524
With the shit I got on Kelly?
Yeah.

212
00:31:54,380 --> 00:32:01,172  X1:078 X2:634 Y1:450 Y2:530
A year ago, when her old man shot
himself, Kelly lost it, ran away.

213
00:32:01,340 --> 00:32:05,094  X1:082 X2:628 Y1:450 Y2:530
They found her in a fleabag motel.
Coked out of her gourd.

214
00:32:06,060 --> 00:32:12,408  X1:062 X2:646 Y1:450 Y2:530
Meanwhile you, Sam, are voted
"Educator of the Year" or some crap.

215
00:32:12,580 --> 00:32:18,610  X1:093 X2:615 Y1:450 Y2:530
If they put the two of you in front
of a jury, they'll look stupid.

216
00:32:18,780 --> 00:32:23,808  X1:076 X2:634 Y1:450 Y2:530
They haven't taken your statement,
because they're looking for dirt.

217
00:32:23,980 --> 00:32:27,256  X1:109 X2:600 Y1:498 Y2:530
And they're not going to find it.

218
00:32:29,060 --> 00:32:32,097  X1:303 X2:405 Y1:498 Y2:530
Right?

219
00:32:32,260 --> 00:32:36,458  X1:117 X2:590 Y1:498 Y2:530
Ken, I don't fuck my students.

220
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:13,049  X1:084 X2:622 Y1:498 Y2:530
He's just showing off for you now.

221
00:33:14,020 --> 00:33:18,855  X1:134 X2:573 Y1:450 Y2:530
Good evening, Ruby.
I see you've still got Walter.

222
00:33:19,020 --> 00:33:23,298  X1:088 X2:620 Y1:450 Y2:530
I was hoping
something had eaten him by now.

223
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:28,898  X1:092 X2:618 Y1:450 Y2:524
- Can I help you with something?
- Suzie called us. Where is she?

224
00:33:29,060 --> 00:33:31,369  X1:206 X2:500 Y1:498 Y2:530
You know the way.

225
00:33:37,580 --> 00:33:41,414  X1:116 X2:595 Y1:498 Y2:530
You won't shoot her, will you?

226
00:33:42,540 --> 00:33:46,215  X1:137 X2:569 Y1:498 Y2:524
I don't believe she's armed.

227
00:34:25,740 --> 00:34:29,938  X1:112 X2:599 Y1:450 Y2:530
It took you long enough !
What if I was being strangled?

228
00:34:30,100 --> 00:34:33,410  X1:135 X2:576 Y1:498 Y2:529
Or fucked in the ass, even?

229
00:34:34,180 --> 00:34:39,812  X1:078 X2:633 Y1:450 Y2:530
- I mean, you do sex crimes, right?
- My partner, Detective Perez.

230
00:34:44,940 --> 00:34:49,855  X1:097 X2:611 Y1:450 Y2:530
Céline. He had a good line
on what cheap fucks people are.

231
00:34:50,020 --> 00:34:53,410  X1:095 X2:616 Y1:498 Y2:530
Suzie, you called us, remember?

232
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:04,938  X1:100 X2:611 Y1:450 Y2:524
- Did they arrest Mr. Lombardo?
- No.

233
00:35:06,180 --> 00:35:09,490  X1:242 X2:467 Y1:450 Y2:524
- Will they?
- I don't know.

234
00:35:09,660 --> 00:35:12,970  X1:211 X2:500 Y1:498 Y2:530
That bothers you?

235
00:35:13,700 --> 00:35:15,850  X1:193 X2:513 Y1:498 Y2:530
I want to go outside.

236
00:35:22,740 --> 00:35:28,053  X1:092 X2:619 Y1:450 Y2:530
- When did he give you this ride?
- About a year ago.

237
00:35:28,220 --> 00:35:32,577  X1:085 X2:626 Y1:450 Y2:530
- Was anyone else at your trailer?
- Nope.

238
00:35:32,740 --> 00:35:35,812  X1:187 X2:524 Y1:450 Y2:524
- So you were alone?
- Yeah.

239
00:35:35,980 --> 00:35:39,131  X1:142 X2:568 Y1:450 Y2:530
- Did he come in with you?
- I guess.

240
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:45,057  X1:186 X2:524 Y1:450 Y2:530
- Did he or didn't he?
- Okay. Yeah, he did.

241
00:35:45,220 --> 00:35:50,089  X1:112 X2:599 Y1:450 Y2:530
Then what? Did he touch you?
Did you flirt with him?

242
00:35:50,260 --> 00:35:54,492  X1:140 X2:568 Y1:450 Y2:524
Suzie, I know you feel bad.
Just tell us the truth.

243
00:35:54,660 --> 00:35:57,299  X1:148 X2:558 Y1:498 Y2:530
I didn't say a thing to him.

244
00:35:58,380 --> 00:36:02,817  X1:148 X2:561 Y1:450 Y2:530
He put his arm around me
and told me I was pretty.

245
00:36:02,980 --> 00:36:07,337  X1:092 X2:616 Y1:450 Y2:530
- I could be really pretty, he said.
- Did you ask him to stop?

246
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:12,938  X1:068 X2:643 Y1:450 Y2:530
Shit! What difference does it make?
No one will believe me anyway.

247
00:36:13,100 --> 00:36:18,572  X1:069 X2:640 Y1:450 Y2:530
- Did Sam Lombardo rape you?
- He did. He pushed me to the floor.

248
00:36:20,780 --> 00:36:26,138  X1:165 X2:544 Y1:450 Y2:529
- Now, are we done?
- Almost, Suzie, almost.

249
00:36:26,420 --> 00:36:28,809  X1:163 X2:547 Y1:498 Y2:530
Could you fight him off?

250
00:36:30,020 --> 00:36:33,729  X1:140 X2:566 Y1:498 Y2:530
No. He stopped by himself.

251
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:37,256  X1:225 X2:482 Y1:450 Y2:524
Is that it?
Leave me alone.

252
00:36:37,420 --> 00:36:41,015  X1:174 X2:535 Y1:450 Y2:530
- Don't touch me!
- All right, take it easy.

253
00:36:41,180 --> 00:36:46,334  X1:126 X2:583 Y1:450 Y2:530
He stopped. And that was it?
He just left?

254
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:53,451  X1:086 X2:622 Y1:450 Y2:524
- Yeah. He did say one thing first.
- What was that?

255
00:36:54,340 --> 00:36:59,050  X1:150 X2:561 Y1:450 Y2:524
He said, "No little bitch
can ever make me come."

256
00:37:01,100 --> 00:37:04,172  X1:237 X2:471 Y1:498 Y2:530
Open the gate.

257
00:37:06,020 --> 00:37:08,136  X1:180 X2:526 Y1:498 Y2:530
Look at this girlfriend.

258
00:37:08,300 --> 00:37:12,532  X1:083 X2:627 Y1:450 Y2:530
- Counsellor, how about a smoke?
- Hello, Jinxy.

259
00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:18,379  X1:067 X2:640 Y1:498 Y2:530
It's a bad news/good news situation.

260
00:37:18,540 --> 00:37:24,615  X1:080 X2:630 Y1:450 Y2:530
No bail, but you get a real attorney
instead of a public defender.

261
00:37:25,300 --> 00:37:28,417  X1:197 X2:510 Y1:450 Y2:524
I'm telling you, Ken.
I'm innocent.

262
00:37:28,580 --> 00:37:33,574  X1:108 X2:601 Y1:450 Y2:524
You are preaching to the choir.
You're not alone.

263
00:37:38,860 --> 00:37:42,330  X1:087 X2:624 Y1:498 Y2:530
So you're the new chicken-licker?

264
00:37:50,100 --> 00:37:53,888  X1:127 X2:583 Y1:450 Y2:530
- Any comment on the case?
- What are your feelings?

265
00:37:54,060 --> 00:37:57,575  X1:149 X2:560 Y1:450 Y2:530
Mr. Lombardo
will get what he deserves.

266
00:37:58,900 --> 00:38:01,255  X1:196 X2:515 Y1:450 Y2:524
- Feeling confident?
- Yes.

267
00:38:01,420 --> 00:38:06,050  X1:088 X2:620 Y1:450 Y2:530
The Lombardo case
has galvanised this upscale town.

268
00:38:06,220 --> 00:38:11,374  X1:067 X2:642 Y1:450 Y2:530
Here's Sandra Van Ryan, millionaire
heiress from the Blue Bay elite.

269
00:38:11,540 --> 00:38:14,373  X1:144 X2:565 Y1:498 Y2:530
And the girl from skid row.

270
00:38:14,540 --> 00:38:19,978  X1:063 X2:648 Y1:450 Y2:530
The jury must choose between these
girls' stories, and Sam Lombardo's.

271
00:38:20,140 --> 00:38:24,338  X1:098 X2:607 Y1:450 Y2:530
Live at the courthouse,
Nancy Duerr, Eyewitness News.

272
00:39:02,740 --> 00:39:07,655  X1:073 X2:635 Y1:450 Y2:530
State of Florida vs. Sam Lombardo.
Sylvia B. Waxman presiding.

273
00:39:07,820 --> 00:39:11,449  X1:294 X2:415 Y1:498 Y2:524
All rise.

274
00:39:14,580 --> 00:39:17,811  X1:214 X2:493 Y1:498 Y2:524
Please be seated.

275
00:39:31,020 --> 00:39:34,854  X1:094 X2:618 Y1:498 Y2:530
Would you like more time, Kelly?

276
00:39:38,180 --> 00:39:44,050  X1:118 X2:590 Y1:450 Y2:530
I know this is hard, Kelly,
but I have one more question.

277
00:39:44,220 --> 00:39:51,331  X1:067 X2:642 Y1:450 Y2:524
And even though we've been over it,
I want us all to be clear about it.

278
00:39:51,500 --> 00:39:57,894  X1:078 X2:631 Y1:450 Y2:530
Kelly, when you saw Mr. Lombardo
intended to have sex with you...

279
00:39:58,060 --> 00:40:03,612  X1:103 X2:606 Y1:450 Y2:530
... what were your exact words?
What did you say?

280
00:40:04,140 --> 00:40:07,530  X1:229 X2:479 Y1:498 Y2:529
I told him, "No."

281
00:40:07,700 --> 00:40:11,978  X1:117 X2:594 Y1:450 Y2:530
I said,
"Stop, Mr. Lombardo, please."

282
00:40:12,140 --> 00:40:15,610  X1:140 X2:566 Y1:498 Y2:530
I screamed for him to stop.

283
00:40:15,780 --> 00:40:18,533  X1:152 X2:557 Y1:498 Y2:529
You screamed, for him...

284
00:40:18,700 --> 00:40:22,375  X1:260 X2:451 Y1:450 Y2:524
... to stop.
And did he?

285
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:27,019  X1:328 X2:379 Y1:498 Y2:524
No.

286
00:40:27,180 --> 00:40:32,413  X1:106 X2:602 Y1:450 Y2:530
He raped me
on the floor of his shitty house.

287
00:40:37,940 --> 00:40:40,693  X1:267 X2:442 Y1:498 Y2:530
Thank you.

288
00:40:45,540 --> 00:40:51,809  X1:088 X2:622 Y1:450 Y2:530
On day two, the second alleged
young victim has taken the stand.

289
00:40:51,980 --> 00:40:55,973  X1:131 X2:580 Y1:450 Y2:530
Yesterday, Kelly Van Ryan
gave an emotional account -

290
00:40:56,140 --> 00:40:59,655  X1:182 X2:526 Y1:450 Y2:530
- and was not swayed
by cross-examination.

291
00:40:59,820 --> 00:41:03,017  X1:080 X2:629 Y1:498 Y2:530
We'll be back later with an update.

292
00:41:25,300 --> 00:41:28,417  X1:238 X2:471 Y1:498 Y2:530
Good morning.

293
00:41:28,580 --> 00:41:37,579  X1:093 X2:617 Y1:450 Y2:530
Miss, when you were picked up
for shoplifting in freshman year -

294
00:41:37,740 --> 00:41:43,576  X1:065 X2:643 Y1:450 Y2:529
- you were allowed to make one call.
You called Mr. Lombardo, correct?

295
00:41:45,020 --> 00:41:48,171  X1:258 X2:451 Y1:498 Y2:524
Miss Toller?

296
00:41:48,340 --> 00:41:52,219  X1:130 X2:581 Y1:450 Y2:524
And when you were expelled
for vandalism...

297
00:41:52,380 --> 00:41:56,339  X1:152 X2:554 Y1:450 Y2:530
I broke a fucking window.
It wasn't my fault.

298
00:41:56,500 --> 00:42:03,815  X1:102 X2:607 Y1:450 Y2:530
Wait until you are asked, and
don't use profanity in this court.

299
00:42:06,940 --> 00:42:12,298  X1:072 X2:640 Y1:450 Y2:530
It was Mr. Lombardo who went with
you, in lieu of a parent conference?

300
00:42:12,460 --> 00:42:15,179  X1:320 X2:390 Y1:498 Y2:524
Yes.

301
00:42:15,340 --> 00:42:20,175  X1:075 X2:634 Y1:450 Y2:530
It seems to me
that Mr. Lombardo was your friend.

302
00:42:20,340 --> 00:42:23,298  X1:291 X2:415 Y1:498 Y2:524
He was.

303
00:42:23,460 --> 00:42:27,214  X1:125 X2:583 Y1:498 Y2:530
But all that changed, when, -

304
00:42:27,380 --> 00:42:34,855  X1:118 X2:590 Y1:450 Y2:530
- according to your testimony,
Mr. Lombardo raped you -

305
00:42:35,020 --> 00:42:40,936  X1:140 X2:568 Y1:450 Y2:530
- on April 23rd of last year.
Is that right?

306
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:46,049  X1:073 X2:638 Y1:450 Y2:530
But in May, when you were
arrested for possessing narcotics, -

307
00:42:46,220 --> 00:42:51,658  X1:093 X2:615 Y1:450 Y2:530
- and again allowed a phone call,
you called Mr. Lombardo.

308
00:42:56,740 --> 00:43:00,972  X1:256 X2:454 Y1:450 Y2:524
- So what?
- "So what?"

309
00:43:02,660 --> 00:43:06,175  X1:268 X2:442 Y1:498 Y2:524
"So what?"

310
00:43:06,700 --> 00:43:09,737  X1:253 X2:455 Y1:498 Y2:530
Oops, Suzie.

311
00:43:09,900 --> 00:43:16,089  X1:082 X2:627 Y1:450 Y2:530
One month after you say this man
raped you, you go to him for help?

312
00:43:16,260 --> 00:43:19,650  X1:095 X2:614 Y1:450 Y2:530
It sounds like
you still considered him a friend.

313
00:43:19,820 --> 00:43:26,373  X1:067 X2:641 Y1:450 Y2:530
- I needed help.
- I'm sure you did. But he was gone.

314
00:43:26,540 --> 00:43:31,330  X1:151 X2:561 Y1:450 Y2:530
And you spent six months
in a correctional facility.

315
00:43:31,500 --> 00:43:37,177  X1:051 X2:660 Y1:450 Y2:530
Did that make you mad, Suzie? That
Sam was gone? That he wasn't there?

316
00:43:38,660 --> 00:43:44,974  X1:102 X2:609 Y1:450 Y2:530
- Is that why you're saying this?
- I said it, because it happened.

317
00:43:45,140 --> 00:43:49,736  X1:067 X2:645 Y1:450 Y2:530
Are you going to sit there and swear
Sam Lombardo raped you?

318
00:43:49,900 --> 00:43:54,849  X1:129 X2:580 Y1:450 Y2:530
- I said he did.
- Let me ask you a question.

319
00:43:55,020 --> 00:43:58,251  X1:142 X2:567 Y1:450 Y2:530
Did you enjoy
being a guest of the state?

320
00:43:58,420 --> 00:44:03,335  X1:094 X2:612 Y1:450 Y2:530
I promise you that if you're lying,
as I believe you are, -

321
00:44:03,500 --> 00:44:05,730  X1:117 X2:591 Y1:498 Y2:530
- you'll visit that facility again.

322
00:44:05,900 --> 00:44:10,928  X1:105 X2:605 Y1:450 Y2:524
Which is why I'll ask you again,
under oath:

323
00:44:11,100 --> 00:44:15,696  X1:099 X2:612 Y1:450 Y2:530
Suzie,
did Samuel Lombardo rape you?

324
00:44:20,340 --> 00:44:23,491  X1:111 X2:598 Y1:450 Y2:530
Miss Toller,
you must answer the question.

325
00:44:27,420 --> 00:44:31,936  X1:234 X2:475 Y1:450 Y2:524
- Miss Toller...
- Goddamn it!

326
00:44:32,100 --> 00:44:37,732  X1:082 X2:627 Y1:450 Y2:530
- This was not my idea.
- Objection ! Defence is badgering.

327
00:44:37,900 --> 00:44:41,290  X1:132 X2:577 Y1:450 Y2:530
The court will hear
what Miss Toller has to say.

328
00:44:41,460 --> 00:44:44,372  X1:258 X2:451 Y1:498 Y2:524
Miss Toller?

329
00:44:46,060 --> 00:44:52,408  X1:112 X2:597 Y1:450 Y2:530
Sam Lombardo didn't rape me.
He didn't rape Kelly, either.

330
00:44:52,580 --> 00:44:56,289  X1:069 X2:640 Y1:450 Y2:524
This is ridiculous!
The witness has been threatened...

331
00:44:56,460 --> 00:45:01,534  X1:150 X2:562 Y1:450 Y2:530
This court intends to hear
Miss Toller's story.

332
00:45:01,700 --> 00:45:03,656  X1:258 X2:451 Y1:498 Y2:524
Miss Toller?

333
00:45:03,820 --> 00:45:07,176  X1:074 X2:633 Y1:498 Y2:530
I just wanted to hurt Mr. Lombardo.

334
00:45:07,340 --> 00:45:11,015  X1:085 X2:621 Y1:498 Y2:530
I mean, he was my friend, at first.

335
00:45:11,180 --> 00:45:16,379  X1:062 X2:648 Y1:450 Y2:524
When I got busted he didn't help me.
I went to that hell-hole.

336
00:45:16,540 --> 00:45:21,091  X1:089 X2:621 Y1:450 Y2:530
- First favourite, then who cares?
- Make her stop.

337
00:45:21,260 --> 00:45:25,094  X1:077 X2:633 Y1:450 Y2:530
When Kelly said we should do this,
I thought, "Cool."

338
00:45:25,260 --> 00:45:29,811  X1:098 X2:608 Y1:450 Y2:530
Big shots who screwed me over,
like Duquette, will get screwed.

339
00:45:29,980 --> 00:45:35,976  X1:105 X2:605 Y1:450 Y2:530
- I'm sorry, I have to object.
- Your honour, may I be heard?

340
00:45:36,140 --> 00:45:39,610  X1:133 X2:576 Y1:450 Y2:530
Mr. Baxter,
you are not trying this case.

341
00:45:39,780 --> 00:45:43,136  X1:255 X2:453 Y1:498 Y2:524
Go sit down.

342
00:45:46,380 --> 00:45:51,374  X1:099 X2:607 Y1:450 Y2:524
Kelly is pissed at Mr. Lombardo,
too. She's in love with him.

343
00:45:51,540 --> 00:45:58,537  X1:089 X2:620 Y1:450 Y2:530
He was her fantasy, but then she
found out he was doing her mom.

344
00:45:58,700 --> 00:46:02,215  X1:213 X2:495 Y1:450 Y2:530
Fuck!
You skanky bitch !

345
00:46:02,380 --> 00:46:07,010  X1:108 X2:601 Y1:450 Y2:530
Get your fucking hands off me.
I'll have you fired !

346
00:46:12,620 --> 00:46:16,056  X1:105 X2:604 Y1:498 Y2:530
Just get the hell away from me.

347
00:46:17,340 --> 00:46:23,529  X1:080 X2:628 Y1:450 Y2:530
- Jesus, man, cut loose!
- I'm just wondering where to stay.

348
00:46:23,700 --> 00:46:27,978  X1:098 X2:608 Y1:450 Y2:530
I've lost my house.
I'm waking up from a nightmare.

349
00:46:28,140 --> 00:46:33,817  X1:087 X2:621 Y1:450 Y2:530
Get over it. We've got an airtight
lawsuit against Sandra Van Ryan.

350
00:46:35,220 --> 00:46:40,772  X1:106 X2:602 Y1:450 Y2:530
- Just like that?
- These people ruined your life.

351
00:46:40,940 --> 00:46:45,650  X1:104 X2:603 Y1:450 Y2:530
I told you they would go too far.
They went overboard !

352
00:46:45,820 --> 00:46:49,779  X1:142 X2:568 Y1:450 Y2:530
They'll settle. Believe me,
they'll be begging to settle.

353
00:46:50,380 --> 00:46:53,577  X1:169 X2:540 Y1:450 Y2:530
Here we go.
Wait up! Come on, girl.

354
00:46:53,740 --> 00:47:00,418  X1:063 X2:648 Y1:450 Y2:530
Sam Lombardo was dismissed when
a victim reversed her testimony.

355
00:47:00,580 --> 00:47:04,459  X1:176 X2:529 Y1:450 Y2:530
Excuse me, over here!
Can anybody read?

356
00:47:08,700 --> 00:47:12,488  X1:169 X2:539 Y1:450 Y2:524
Nail that shyster's balls
to the nearest wall.

357
00:47:12,660 --> 00:47:17,734  X1:088 X2:621 Y1:450 Y2:530
That was possible, until Miss Not
So Bright started throwing things.

358
00:47:17,900 --> 00:47:22,416  X1:121 X2:590 Y1:450 Y2:530
Are you just going to let them
get away with this... shit?

359
00:47:22,580 --> 00:47:25,458  X1:182 X2:527 Y1:450 Y2:524
On the word
of a white trash bitch.

360
00:47:25,620 --> 00:47:30,057  X1:092 X2:618 Y1:450 Y2:530
I don't think you get it, Sandy.
Your princess committed perjury.

361
00:47:30,220 --> 00:47:37,137  X1:118 X2:590 Y1:450 Y2:530
- I'll try to keep her out of jail.
- What are we going to do?

362
00:47:44,060 --> 00:47:47,814  X1:145 X2:563 Y1:450 Y2:530
- Here's your coffee, Sam.
- Thank you.

363
00:47:59,860 --> 00:48:03,170  X1:302 X2:404 Y1:498 Y2:524
Ken...

364
00:48:13,100 --> 00:48:15,409  X1:243 X2:465 Y1:498 Y2:530
Sorry I'm late.

365
00:48:15,580 --> 00:48:20,973  X1:165 X2:543 Y1:450 Y2:530
- Hold my calls, Lenore.
- Okay, Mr. Bowden.

366
00:48:40,700 --> 00:48:43,498  X1:200 X2:510 Y1:498 Y2:530
Thank you, Sandra.

367
00:48:46,180 --> 00:48:51,174  X1:216 X2:491 Y1:450 Y2:530
I'll be seeing you.
Okay?

368
00:48:57,780 --> 00:49:01,898  X1:142 X2:566 Y1:450 Y2:530
Nice to see you, Tom.
Come by, we'll have lunch.

369
00:49:05,260 --> 00:49:08,138  X1:196 X2:512 Y1:498 Y2:530
See you at the club.
