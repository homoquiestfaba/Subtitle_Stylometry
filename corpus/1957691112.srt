Do you really gotta play
that damn thing right now?

8
00:03:02,312 --> 00:03:05,663
Is it, uh, messing up
your concentration?

9
00:03:05,794 --> 00:03:09,189
- Yeah.
- Then, yes, I do.

11
00:03:26,728 --> 00:03:29,644
Friedman, you're such a pain
in the ass with that recorder.

12
00:03:30,297 --> 00:03:31,646
Watch this.

13
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:44,789
Whoa, whoa, God, Thompson!

15
00:03:58,368 --> 00:04:00,240
- Hey!
- Dammit, Thompson, I had him!

16
00:04:00,370 --> 00:04:03,591
Oh? You had me?
I had one move and it was over.

17
00:04:03,721 --> 00:04:05,897
- Oh, is that right?
- They seem to think that it's funny that...

18
00:04:06,028 --> 00:04:07,682
Cut the crap!

19
00:04:07,812 --> 00:04:10,554

00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:31,619

Lieutenant.

<i>Jerry's still sleeping.</i>

24
00:04:34,839 --> 00:04:36,058
How's it look, Wilson?

25
00:04:36,188 --> 00:04:39,061
Might help if I knew
what I was looking for.

26
00:04:44,849 --> 00:04:47,243
<i>Looks pretty dull
from where I'm sitting.</i>

27
00:04:47,374 --> 00:04:50,768
Which, by the way,
is still very uncomfortable.

28
00:04:52,944 --> 00:04:57,079
For the last time Dixon,
I hear you and I don't care.

29
00:05:01,649 --> 00:05:03,477
- No offense...
- Here we go.

30

No seriously fellas, what the
hell are doing up here anyway?

31
00:05:07,219 --> 00:05:08,960
You know the answer
to that, Lieutenant.

32
00:05:09,091 --> 00:05:11,180
All they tell us is
"need to know."

33

[Finn] <i>Oh, yeah, sure,</i>

36
00:05:19,188 --> 00:05:20,668
Could ya find
this damn needle, too?

37
00:05:20,798 --> 00:05:21,756
I left it over in this haystack.

38
00:05:21,886 --> 00:05:23,279
Stow it, Sergeant.

39
00:05:23,410 --> 00:05:25,760
Jerry moves this base
every time we spot it.

40
00:05:25,890 --> 00:05:28,328
This time, we're not
giving them the chance.

41
00:05:28,458 --> 00:05:31,548
So I need everyone,
and I mean everyone...

42
00:05:33,028 --> 00:05:35,944

44
00:05:49,827 --> 00:05:51,742

find anything out here?

[Reynolds] <i>That's not our job.</i>

46
00:05:55,355 --> 00:05:57,705
You and I, we just keep
Yankee Lady flying.

47
00:05:57,835 --> 00:05:59,576
<i>Still got that compass
I gave ya?</i>

48
00:06:01,317 --> 00:06:05,234
Yeah. It's fancy.

[laughs]

50
00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:08,803
I don't think
this cute little thing's

51
00:06:08,933 --> 00:06:10,195
gonna point to any Nazi base.

52
00:06:10,326 --> 00:06:12,415
No, but it'll
get your sorry ass home.

53
00:06:12,546 --> 00:06:15,723
It better, too,
I need that back.

54
00:06:15,853 --> 00:06:18,203
That was given to me by
a pretty little thing back home.

55
00:06:18,334 --> 00:06:19,553
Oh, yeah?

56
00:06:19,683 --> 00:06:21,903
<i>Why don't you keep it, then?</i>

57
00:06:22,033 --> 00:06:24,471
Because I'm not the one
afraid I ain't gonna make it home.

58
00:06:24,601 --> 00:06:26,647
I don't know, Jack.

59
00:06:26,777 --> 00:06:28,953
How many Nazi targets
you see bombed daily?

60
00:06:30,477 --> 00:06:31,869
<i>We're hitting them
where it hurts.</i>

[Reynolds] <i>No, I get it.</i>

65
00:06:37,309 --> 00:06:38,615
I'll call up Berlin,

66
00:06:38,746 --> 00:06:40,704
set up a boxing match
between you and Adolf.

67
00:06:41,444 --> 00:06:42,489
[Dixon] <i>Ha!</i>

68
00:06:42,619 --> 00:06:44,404
Yeah, I'll put my money
on the Jew!

69
00:06:45,448 --> 00:06:47,232
- Smart.
- [Wilson] <i>Yeah, Holden,</i>

70
00:06:47,363 --> 00:06:49,017
I'll bet you
got a lot of relatives

71
00:06:49,147 --> 00:06:51,759
- who'd line up to take a swing at der Fuhrer.
- [chuckles]

72

[Reynolds] <i>Trust me, kid,</i>

73
00:06:54,065 --> 00:06:56,720
one man can make
an impact on this war.

74
00:06:58,069 --> 00:07:01,508
Just maybe not
the way you think.

75
00:07:01,638 --> 00:07:03,205
I mean, have you guys
heard the rumors

76
00:07:03,335 --> 00:07:04,424
of what's going on down there?

77
00:07:04,554 --> 00:07:06,251
Those are just rumors, David.

78
00:07:06,382 --> 00:07:07,818
And if they're true?

79
00:07:07,949 --> 00:07:09,994
We should be going in there,
guns blazing,

80
00:07:10,125 --> 00:07:11,648
making sure they aren't.

81
00:07:11,779 --> 00:07:13,607
We do good work up here, Holden,

82
00:07:13,737 --> 00:07:16,000
and you need us
just as much as we need you.

83
00:07:16,131 --> 00:07:19,917
- Is that so?
- Lieutenant Rodgers, tell me we're close.

84
00:07:20,048 --> 00:07:23,051
Based on intel,
we should be coming up

85
00:07:23,181 --> 00:07:26,924
on the suspected target's
visual range now, sir.

86
00:07:28,012 --> 00:07:30,275
Alright, everyone clam up.

Where? How many?

91
00:07:48,163 --> 00:07:50,034
Seven o'clock.
Looks like two fighters.

92

<i>Out of range but coming in fast.</i>

93
00:07:55,692 --> 00:07:58,652

Report.

592

We were ambushed, sir.

Six dead,
three seriously wounded.

594

I have our remaining men
searching the forest for the soldier.

[speaks German]

597
01:02:50,418 --> 01:02:53,639
You let one soldier
defeat an entire patrol?

598
01:02:53,770 --> 01:02:55,380
We believe he may be wounded.

599
01:02:55,510 --> 01:03:00,254
Captain, your men are in need
of medical attention.

600
01:03:00,385 --> 01:03:03,257
Return to base
and give a full report,

601
01:03:03,388 --> 01:03:05,433
I will find the American.

602
01:03:05,564 --> 01:03:08,828
- My orders were to find you and the captain...
- There is no time to argue.

Your disgraceful display will be
included in my report, Captain.

Unless, of course,
I retrieve the soldier for you.

607
01:03:27,847 --> 01:03:31,590

I am sorry, sir.

I cannot disobey orders.

612
01:04:00,575 --> 01:04:02,273
So, what if one of us
fakes sick?

613
01:04:02,403 --> 01:04:04,928
Guard opens the door,
we jump him,

614
01:04:05,058 --> 01:04:07,147
take his gun
and bolt to freedom?

615
01:04:07,278 --> 01:04:08,801
Yeah, I like how that sounds.

616
01:04:08,932 --> 01:04:11,848
Won't work. These Krauts
don't care about us.

617
01:04:11,978 --> 01:04:14,938
The minute they walk in here,
we're dead.

618
01:04:15,068 --> 01:04:16,591
Well, we can't just sit here
and do nothing,

619
01:04:16,722 --> 01:04:18,419
they're gonna kill us
no matter what!

[sighs]

621
01:04:21,640 --> 01:04:25,383
Maybe we should, uh,
all be brainstorming, here?

622
01:04:25,513 --> 01:04:27,080
Wouldn't waste your breath.

623
01:04:27,211 --> 01:04:28,908
Why, what's her problem?

624
01:04:29,039 --> 01:04:30,301
I don't know how long she's
been here,

625
01:04:30,431 --> 01:04:33,043
but I can tell you
I wouldn't start nothing.

626
01:04:33,173 --> 01:04:36,133
About a week ago, one of those
guards thought he'd get cute.

627
01:04:36,263 --> 01:04:38,875
They yanked her out,
didn't get very far.

628
01:04:39,005 --> 01:04:41,442
She came back real fast,
blood all over her face.

629
01:04:41,573 --> 01:04:42,530
Why, what happened?

630
01:04:42,661 --> 01:04:44,706
Guard tried to get friendly.

631
01:04:45,142 --> 01:04:46,795
She bit the tongue
out of his mouth.

632
01:04:51,148 --> 01:04:53,672
Boy, I gotta get out of here.

633

We all gotta get out of here.

634
01:04:56,240 --> 01:04:58,459
Now, ideas, let's hear 'em.

635
01:05:01,941 --> 01:05:03,551
What about you, Lock port?

636
01:05:04,857 --> 01:05:06,163
- Lock port?
- Lock port?

[snaps fingers]
Hey!

638
01:05:10,602 --> 01:05:12,865
Sorry about that.

639
01:05:12,996 --> 01:05:16,303
It's just these walls.

640
01:05:17,652 --> 01:05:20,655
These same goddamn walls.

641
01:05:22,048 --> 01:05:23,180
It's so cramped in here.

642
01:05:24,703 --> 01:05:26,661
Even more than before.

643
01:05:28,533 --> 01:05:30,665
I guess I don't like
being cooped up.

644
01:05:31,840 --> 01:05:33,668
Pilot for a reason, you know.

645
01:05:35,279 --> 01:05:38,412
Cap, I'm not liking
the look in his eyes.

646
01:05:41,850 --> 01:05:43,287
What's that supposed to mean?

647
01:05:43,417 --> 01:05:46,464
It means I don't know you,

648
01:05:46,594 --> 01:05:48,205
and I don't know
what to do with you.

649
01:05:49,423 --> 01:05:51,686
What, you think I'm some spy?

650
01:05:52,252 --> 01:05:56,126
All I know is it was your
plane that shot mine down.

651
01:05:56,256 --> 01:05:59,085
If you hadn't got captured,
I sure as hell wouldn't be here.

652
01:05:59,216 --> 01:06:00,173
Well, by the looks of you,

653
01:06:00,304 --> 01:06:01,261
I'd just assume you're used to

654
01:06:01,392 --> 01:06:03,437
spending time in a prison cell.

655
01:06:03,568 --> 01:06:05,352
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
- Hey.

656
01:06:06,310 --> 01:06:08,442
Hank, knock it off.

657
01:06:11,141 --> 01:06:13,360
Look, I get it,

658
01:06:13,491 --> 01:06:16,015
it's real tight quarters
and none of us want to be here.

659
01:06:16,146 --> 01:06:19,976
But we cannot start playing the
blame game or turning on each other.

660
01:06:21,455 --> 01:06:23,675
We're all stuck in here.
But out there?

661
01:06:23,805 --> 01:06:26,069
That's where the real fight is.

662
01:06:26,199 --> 01:06:28,854
So let's figure out
how to join it!

663
01:06:31,291 --> 01:06:32,901
You don't understand, man?

664
01:06:33,032 --> 01:06:34,991
There is no fight.

665
01:06:38,342 --> 01:06:39,691
We already lost.

666
01:06:41,040 --> 01:06:42,563
Now it's just...

667
01:06:44,957 --> 01:06:47,133
biding our time until the end.

No!

676
01:08:02,252 --> 01:08:03,514
I'm sorry, Jack.

677
01:08:13,176 --> 01:08:14,220
I'm sorry.

678
01:08:34,893 --> 01:08:36,503
That's flying too low.

[dramatic music playing]

683
01:09:06,011 --> 01:09:07,099
Come on.

[speaking German on radio]

688
01:09:21,374 --> 01:09:24,072
[Captain Gruber] We are on
schedule. As well, we've obtained

689
01:09:24,203 --> 01:09:27,859
all RAF identification codes
through our contacts in England.

690
01:09:27,989 --> 01:09:31,515
These codes will be crucial
in safely flying the aircraft into...

691
01:09:42,700 --> 01:09:45,355
I see we have
recovered one pilot.

692
01:09:45,485 --> 01:09:47,052
What happened to your men?

693
01:09:47,183 --> 01:09:48,445
Did their plane crash, too?

694
01:09:49,924 --> 01:09:51,839
Sir, we were ambushed.

695
01:09:51,970 --> 01:09:55,495
Ambushed? By whom?

696
01:09:55,626 --> 01:09:57,367
An American pilot.

697
01:09:57,497 --> 01:10:01,458
I shot him down,
but he survived.

698
01:10:01,588 --> 01:10:03,808
And where is this pilot now?

699
01:10:03,938 --> 01:10:05,897
We do not know, sir.

700
01:10:06,027 --> 01:10:10,293
The major's inability
to dispose of this American

701
01:10:10,423 --> 01:10:13,209
has cost der Fuhrer
many soldiers today.

702
01:10:15,254 --> 01:10:19,389
Der Fuhrer does not care
about soldiers like them.

703
01:10:21,042 --> 01:10:23,088
You should be
far more concerned with me.

704
01:10:24,132 --> 01:10:25,525
[exhales]

705
01:10:25,656 --> 01:10:29,790
Major Roth, I will send for you
when you are needed.

706
01:10:29,921 --> 01:10:32,010
Captain Gruber,
please continue your briefing.

707
01:10:32,140 --> 01:10:36,580
The uniforms from the B-17 bomber
crew should fool any RAF scout planes,

708
01:10:36,710 --> 01:10:40,410
but we must explain the missing
P-51 fighters to the Allied ground control.

709
01:10:40,540 --> 01:10:41,976
- I suggest we say...
- [foot stamps]

710
01:10:44,501 --> 01:10:48,200
Major, have you decided
to add insubordination

711
01:10:48,331 --> 01:10:50,420
to your charge
of dereliction of duty?

712
01:10:52,248 --> 01:10:53,336
What?

713
01:10:53,466 --> 01:10:55,599
You were
placed on this assignment,

714
01:10:55,729 --> 01:10:57,862
along with
your arrogant brother,

715
01:10:57,992 --> 01:10:59,777
because you were the best.

716
01:11:02,997 --> 01:11:05,173
I knew your brother
was not up to this.

717
01:11:08,394 --> 01:11:10,396
I'm surprised
he did not kill you both.

718
01:11:11,571 --> 01:11:14,835
Sir, my brother died bravely...

719
01:11:14,966 --> 01:11:18,883
Your brother died a failure!

720
01:11:19,013 --> 01:11:22,060
Be thankful you do not
share his fate.

721
01:11:23,104 --> 01:11:24,671
Let me find the American.

722
01:11:24,802 --> 01:11:26,194
He is weak.

723
01:11:26,325 --> 01:11:29,023
You are the weak one, Major.

724
01:11:29,154 --> 01:11:30,198
You have caused enough...

725
01:11:30,329 --> 01:11:31,243
[speaking German]

726
01:11:35,160 --> 01:11:38,511
Major, tomorrow morning
you will be sent back to Berlin.

727
01:11:40,687 --> 01:11:42,820
You will receive the Iron Cross

728
01:11:42,950 --> 01:11:45,431
and retire quietly to serve
your Fuhrer in another way.

729
01:11:47,041 --> 01:11:50,218
Perhaps training
a new generation of pilots

730
01:11:50,349 --> 01:11:54,701
who someday might be as good
as you... once were.

731
01:11:57,965 --> 01:12:00,228
I do not want a medal.

732
01:12:01,360 --> 01:12:03,188
I want the American.

733
01:12:03,319 --> 01:12:07,714
So, give me the night,
I will find the pilot.

734
01:12:07,845 --> 01:12:10,674
And I will bring his head
back to Berlin as a trophy!

735
01:12:10,804 --> 01:12:11,805
- [speaking German]
- But my mission...

736
01:12:11,936 --> 01:12:15,331
Your mission was
"no survivors!"

737
01:12:16,897 --> 01:12:19,247
Kampfgeschwader 200
can only exist

738
01:12:19,378 --> 01:12:21,946
in complete secrecy.

739
01:12:26,211 --> 01:12:28,213
You are confined
to your quarters.

740
01:12:28,344 --> 01:12:31,172
I will not see you again.

741
01:12:45,578 --> 01:12:48,233
Captain, once again
finish your briefing.

742
01:12:50,104 --> 01:12:52,933
Sir, there is a concern
that the blast radius

743
01:12:53,064 --> 01:12:54,500
may overtake the aircraft.

744
01:12:54,631 --> 01:12:56,676
[Krieger] Captain,
keep your mind on the mission.

745
01:12:56,807 --> 01:12:59,766
Or your next mission
will be on the Russian Front!

Careful, you fools!
Do you want to kill us all?

749
01:13:24,574 --> 01:13:26,663
Hurry now! Hurry!

750
01:13:26,793 --> 01:13:28,316
But gentle, gently...

751
01:13:28,447 --> 01:13:30,667
But Schnell! Schnell!

What do they feed these guys?

759
01:14:40,388 --> 01:14:42,129
[Thompson] These Krauts
have to feed us sooner or later.

760
01:14:42,260 --> 01:14:44,001
- [Finn] Yeah.
- [Thompson] When they open that door...

761
01:14:56,666 --> 01:14:57,710
Hello.

762
01:15:01,453 --> 01:15:03,411
Do you remember us?

763
01:15:04,717 --> 01:15:06,893
Josef remembers you.

764
01:15:08,678 --> 01:15:12,638
Why don't you come show him
how sorry you are?

765
01:15:17,774 --> 01:15:21,168
Poor Josef, he cannot speak,

766
01:15:21,299 --> 01:15:24,476
but I know
that he likes you very much.

767
01:15:24,607 --> 01:15:26,217
Don't you like him?

768
01:15:27,174 --> 01:15:30,395
He is very handsome.

769
01:15:30,526 --> 01:15:33,093
- Hey, pal, back off!
- Finn.

770
01:15:35,356 --> 01:15:37,533
Should we give it another try?

771
01:15:37,663 --> 01:15:39,535
[spits]

772
01:15:43,713 --> 01:15:45,018
Go to hell!

773
01:15:47,325 --> 01:15:50,023
Your cooperation
would be very helpful.

774
01:15:50,284 --> 01:15:54,506
But make no mistake,
we do not need it.

775
01:15:57,291 --> 01:15:58,379
Oh, hell no!

776
01:16:00,904 --> 01:16:01,774
Back up!

777
01:16:06,474 --> 01:16:09,652
Not you.
Come here, sweet girl.

778
01:16:12,480 --> 01:16:14,613
Hey, you don't have to do this.

779
01:16:14,744 --> 01:16:16,484
Yeah, take it easy man!

780
01:16:16,615 --> 01:16:20,532
Put your schwarz dog on a leash
or I'll put him down myself.

781
01:16:20,663 --> 01:16:23,100
We are here
to take what is ours.

782
01:16:28,584 --> 01:16:29,497
Hey!

783
01:16:36,722 --> 01:16:38,071
No! No!

784
01:16:38,202 --> 01:16:40,204
Get your hands off her,

Here.

797
01:17:49,490 --> 01:17:53,146
- We need to move.
- OK, we go back out the same way I came in. Alright?

798
01:17:53,277 --> 01:17:55,235
Hide out in the forest, hit and
run until they send a rescue...

799
01:17:55,366 --> 01:17:58,195
There's no time.
Holden, they've got a bomb.

800
01:17:58,325 --> 01:18:00,980
- A wunderwaffe!
- A what?

801
01:18:01,111 --> 01:18:03,374
Super weapon.
It can take out an entire city.

802
01:18:06,116 --> 01:18:07,770
- London.
- What?

803
01:18:09,249 --> 01:18:10,642
I found their flight-plans.

804
01:18:10,773 --> 01:18:12,339
I think they're gonna
bomb London.

805
01:18:12,470 --> 01:18:14,428
The allies won't know
what hit 'em until it's too late.

806
01:18:15,299 --> 01:18:17,170
Those bastards!

807
01:18:17,301 --> 01:18:20,043
They're using my plane
as a goddamn trojan horse!

808
01:18:22,045 --> 01:18:23,394

OK, look, we need to arm up.
Follow me.

OK, you two, Thompson and
Armstrong, give us cover fire.

We're gonna make it down to the
first floor, toward the Yankee Lady.

No matter what happens...

826
01:19:54,528 --> 01:19:56,052

that's where they took Harry.

You think he's still up there?

836
01:21:51,341 --> 01:21:53,386
If he is,
we can't just leave him.

837
01:21:53,517 --> 01:21:55,823
We'll cover you
if you think you can make it.

01:58:30,755 --> 01:58:32,279
[laughs]

1084
01:58:41,418 --> 01:58:44,726
[man on radio] <i>This is Allied
Command to unidentified B-25 bomber.</i>

1085
01:58:44,856 --> 01:58:48,817
<i>You will be shot down if you do
not identify yourself immediately.</i>

1086
01:58:48,947 --> 01:58:50,993
<i>Repeat, you will be shot down...</i>

1087
01:58:51,124 --> 01:58:53,126
Yes! Yes, Allied Command!

1088
01:58:53,256 --> 01:58:54,910
This is Captain David Holden.

1089
01:58:55,040 --> 01:58:58,174
[chuckles]
My P-51 was shot down,

1090
01:58:58,305 --> 01:59:00,611
I'm coming in hot
in a recovered B-25.

1091
01:59:01,873 --> 01:59:04,224
Requesting permission to land.

1092
01:59:04,354 --> 01:59:06,139
[man on radio]
<i>Welcome back, Captain Holden.</i>

1093
01:59:06,269 --> 01:59:10,186
<i>You and Captain Reynolds
are long overdue.</i>

1094
01:59:10,317 --> 01:59:12,493
<i>We look forward
to your explanation</i>

1095
01:59:12,623 --> 01:59:14,625
<i>of what the devil
is going on up there.</i>

1096
01:59:16,105 --> 01:59:18,412
<i>You are cleared to land.</i>

1097
01:59:31,599 --> 01:59:32,948
Let's go home.

1098
01:59:38,083 --> 01:59:40,085
[dramatic music playing]

1099
02:00:25,827 --> 02:00:27,568
Excuse me, ma'am.

1100
02:00:27,698 --> 02:00:29,831
Uh, you wouldn't happen to be
Miss Katherine?

1101
02:00:29,961 --> 02:00:31,963
Yes, I am.

1102
02:00:34,966 --> 02:00:37,926
Is this about my fiancé?

1103
02:00:38,056 --> 02:00:39,710
Men already came
a couple months back, and I...

1104
02:00:39,841 --> 02:00:41,582
Yes, this is about Jack.

1105
02:00:48,371 --> 02:00:50,417
My name is Captain David Holden.

1106
02:00:52,114 --> 02:00:53,507
Jack was my wing man.

1107
02:00:56,336 --> 02:00:57,250
I, uh...

1108
02:01:03,386 --> 02:01:04,605
I brought something for you.

1109
02:01:15,180 --> 02:01:17,705
[sniffles] Please, where
are my manners? Come in.

1110
02:01:17,835 --> 02:01:19,359
Uh, no, I really...

1111
02:01:19,489 --> 02:01:21,970
I don't mean to bother you,
ma'am, and I can't stay long.

1112
02:01:26,844 --> 02:01:28,019
I always knew.

1113
02:01:31,066 --> 02:01:32,894
I knew he wasn't coming home.

1114
02:01:36,593 --> 02:01:40,771
I begged him to stay,
but he wouldn't listen.

1115
02:01:42,686 --> 02:01:45,602
Jack had his ways.

1116
02:01:45,733 --> 02:01:47,865
When he made up
his mind about something...

1117
02:01:49,563 --> 02:01:52,261
Believe me, I know.

1118
02:01:55,743 --> 02:01:58,746
In fact, Jack's the reason why I
had that compass to begin with.

1119
02:01:58,876 --> 02:02:00,051
What do you mean?

1120
02:02:02,706 --> 02:02:04,012
I told Jack...

1121
02:02:06,449 --> 02:02:08,799
that I was worried that we were
never gonna make it back.

1122
02:02:10,801 --> 02:02:12,063
[sniffles]

1123
02:02:13,369 --> 02:02:15,066
And he said that he
had a lucky charm.

1124
02:02:17,678 --> 02:02:19,636
And he snuck that
in my bag one morning.

1125
02:02:20,855 --> 02:02:22,291
He wouldn't take it back.

1126
02:02:24,598 --> 02:02:26,121
And it wasn't until...

1127
02:02:27,775 --> 02:02:29,254
Well, until after...

1128
02:02:30,255 --> 02:02:32,649
that I found the photo.

1129
02:02:39,743 --> 02:02:42,180
He said that one day
it might save my life.

1130
02:02:44,705 --> 02:02:45,967
Well, it didn't.

1131
02:02:51,015 --> 02:02:52,713
But Captain Reynolds did.

1132
02:02:54,497 --> 02:02:56,325
[crying]

1133
02:02:59,110 --> 02:03:00,242
And, uh... [clears throat]

1134
02:03:00,373 --> 02:03:01,591
Anyway, I just thought that...

1135
02:03:05,378 --> 02:03:06,814
he wanted it to be here.

1136
02:03:07,945 --> 02:03:09,077
With you.

1137
02:03:10,818 --> 02:03:12,385
[sighs]

1138
02:03:14,822 --> 02:03:16,563
I should be on my way now.

1139
02:03:17,738 --> 02:03:18,695
Ma'am.

1140
02:03:22,220 --> 02:03:23,352
Thank you.

1141
02:03:27,530 --> 02:03:29,837
Thank you for bringing him
back to me.

1142
02:03:32,622 --> 02:03:33,754
You're welcome.

1143
02:03:38,236 --> 02:03:40,500
