-Wow, it's cold.
-She'll be here in about an hour.

-There you go. Look.
-Yes! Finally l'm taller than you were.

34
00:03:06,177 --> 00:03:09,476
And smarter, and more clever and sweeter.

35
00:03:10,214 --> 00:03:11,704
Here you go. Bye.

36
00:03:11,882 --> 00:03:13,406
Mom.

Did you know that Minnesota
is the Gopher State?

42
00:03:31,969 --> 00:03:34,529
Did you know that all gophers
go away in the winter?

43
00:03:37,274 --> 00:03:38,901
Oh, good morning, Nana.

44
00:03:39,076 --> 00:03:42,011
-Hi, Nana.
-Good morning, you two.

45
00:03:42,179 --> 00:03:45,876
Your father is setting up his studio,
and there's your lunch money.

46
00:03:46,050 --> 00:03:48,109
Whoa, sunglasses, please.

47
00:03:48,285 --> 00:03:51,846
l'm going to my Jazzercise class later.

00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:59,928
-She's nervous about starting her new school.
-Tyler. No, l'm not.

50
00:04:00,097 --> 00:04:02,156
Chrissa, think of it.

51
00:04:02,333 --> 00:04:05,825
This is a fabulous opportunity.
You get to make new friends.

52
00:04:06,537 --> 00:04:10,337
And by the way, don't wait for them
to come up and say hi.

53
00:04:10,508 --> 00:04:12,635
She means, don't do your shy thing.

54
00:04:13,811 --> 00:04:18,544
Chrissa, l want you to march up to the first
person you see and say, ''Hello there.''

55
00:04:18,716 --> 00:04:20,877
''Hello'' is the first word in a friendship.

56
00:04:21,719 --> 00:04:22,981
Okay, Nana.

57
00:04:23,154 --> 00:04:26,180
And if you need to break the ice,
think of a good joke.

58
00:04:26,357 --> 00:04:27,984
You wanna think of one now?

59
00:04:28,159 --> 00:04:31,128
-No, that's okay, Nana.
-Okay.

60
00:04:31,295 --> 00:04:35,197
Hey, you two,
l have a big surprise for both of you.

61
00:04:35,366 --> 00:04:39,496
-What is it?
-Come on, bring your things.

62
00:04:40,638 --> 00:04:43,573
-Come on, hurry up.
-Okay, l'm coming, l'm coming.

63
00:04:43,741 --> 00:04:46,904
-Slowpoke.
-Be quiet.

64
00:04:56,921 --> 00:04:59,412
Oh, my gosh. Cosmos had her baby.

65
00:04:59,890 --> 00:05:02,358
-Why didn't you tell us?
-Because l love surprises...

66
00:05:02,526 --> 00:05:04,960
...and l wanted to wait till you were here.

67
00:05:05,362 --> 00:05:07,262
This little one belongs to you two.

68
00:05:07,431 --> 00:05:09,797
-Yes!
-Oh, awesome!

69
00:05:09,967 --> 00:05:13,767
-So cute. ls it a boy or girl?
-A little girl.

70
00:05:13,938 --> 00:05:16,031
-What should we name her?
-How about Bubba?

71
00:05:17,274 --> 00:05:20,710
-Bubba? Why would we name a girl Bubba?
-Why not?

72
00:05:21,512 --> 00:05:23,173
-Do you wanna feed her?
-Yeah, l do.

73
00:05:23,347 --> 00:05:24,609
Here you go, Tyler.

74
00:05:24,782 --> 00:05:28,980
-l just don't want her to spit at me.
-Oh, Chrissa, llamas don't spit at people.

75
00:05:29,153 --> 00:05:31,519
Especially not Cosmos and Checkers.

76
00:05:31,689 --> 00:05:35,420
Llamas only spit at each other
and only when provoked.

77
00:05:35,626 --> 00:05:37,753
-Okay.
-Come here, honey.

78
00:05:37,928 --> 00:05:38,952
There you go.

79
00:05:40,097 --> 00:05:41,894

80
00:05:42,066 --> 00:05:46,730
-See? She just-- Oh, boy, she loves you now.
-Cosmos.

81
00:05:48,506 --> 00:05:49,564
There you go.

82
00:05:52,943 --> 00:05:54,501
-Gross.
-Sweet.

83
00:05:54,678 --> 00:05:58,011
Cosmos. And after l said what a lady you are.

84
00:05:58,182 --> 00:05:59,513
Nana.

85
00:06:04,655 --> 00:06:05,679
Excuse me.

86
00:06:05,856 --> 00:06:09,622
-Come on, Tyler. Come on.
-l'm coming.

87
00:06:09,793 --> 00:06:12,421

-Excuse me.

91
00:06:22,873 --> 00:06:25,307
-Who is she?
-Who cares?

92
00:06:25,476 --> 00:06:27,910
-Who starts school on a Friday?
-Yeah.

93
00:06:28,078 --> 00:06:29,511
She can have lots of fun.

94
00:06:34,351 --> 00:06:37,809
Adverbs end in the letters what?

95
00:06:37,988 --> 00:06:40,047
-l know, l know, l know.
-Mr. Beck?

96
00:06:41,292 --> 00:06:44,557
Class, l have a new friend for you to meet.

97
00:06:44,728 --> 00:06:47,060
-Chrissa Maxwell.
-Hi.

98
00:06:47,231 --> 00:06:50,496
-She's gonna be joining your class.
-Chrissa. We've been expecting you.

99
00:06:50,668 --> 00:06:53,034
Now, l want you all to make Chrissa
feel at home.

100
00:06:53,204 --> 00:06:55,570
Mr. Beck? Maybe you could assign
a lunchroom buddy.

101
00:06:55,739 --> 00:06:58,367
Unless you wanna have lunch
with the principal.

102
00:06:59,777 --> 00:07:01,210
l didn't think so.

103
00:07:01,378 --> 00:07:03,573
Sonali, what about you?

104
00:07:04,381 --> 00:07:06,372
Oh, thank you, Sonali.

105
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:09,651
l think you can take it from here, Mr. Beck.
Goodbye.

106
00:07:10,588 --> 00:07:13,250
-Bye, Mrs. Ziminsky.
-Bye-bye.

107
00:07:13,424 --> 00:07:14,914
Bye.

108
00:07:15,226 --> 00:07:18,252
Guys, Chrissa decided to start school today,
on a Friday...

109
00:07:18,429 --> 00:07:21,193
...because we're celebrating
Valentine's Day today.

110
00:07:21,365 --> 00:07:23,833
And what better way to get to know
our new friend...

111
00:07:24,001 --> 00:07:25,969
...than on the day that celebrates what?

112
00:07:26,136 --> 00:07:28,001

113
00:07:28,172 --> 00:07:31,039
-So did you get the list of students?
-Yeah, it's in here.

115
00:07:34,411 --> 00:07:35,435
-That's it.
-Yes, sir.

116
00:07:36,981 --> 00:07:39,245
This is for you,
a little mailbox from the class.

117
00:07:39,416 --> 00:07:42,874
-Thanks.
-So why don't you tell us about yourself?

118
00:07:44,255 --> 00:07:48,954
Well, l just moved here from lowa and l have
a brother named Tyler who's in fifth grade.

119
00:07:49,426 --> 00:07:54,022
My mom just got a new job as a doctor
at Saint Luke's...

120
00:07:54,198 --> 00:07:56,166
...and my dad owns a pottery studio.

121
00:07:56,333 --> 00:07:57,698
A Pilates studio?

122
00:07:58,135 --> 00:08:00,501
-What?
-You know, exercise.

123
00:08:00,671 --> 00:08:03,071
-Yoga?
-Oh, yeah, my mom goes there all the time.

124
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:06,004
Tara, slow down.
Give her a chance to answer.

125
00:08:06,176 --> 00:08:09,771
No, it's a pottery studio. He's a ceramic artist.

126
00:08:10,981 --> 00:08:14,246
And l understand you moved in
with your grandmother on Lake Chandler?

127
00:08:14,752 --> 00:08:16,515
Yeah.

128
00:08:17,621 --> 00:08:19,589
My grandpa died a few months back...

129
00:08:19,757 --> 00:08:21,884
...and it's just been hard for her
to take care of the house.

130
00:08:22,059 --> 00:08:23,924
-lt just made sense. Yeah.
-Yeah.

131
00:08:24,094 --> 00:08:27,063
Now, why don't you take a seat here
with Cluster 4?

132
00:08:27,231 --> 00:08:30,394
This is Jayden, Tara and Sonali.

133
00:08:32,436 --> 00:08:35,166
-Oh, no, she's sitting with us.
-So l finished my math....

134
00:08:36,473 --> 00:08:37,497
Hello.

135
00:08:39,677 --> 00:08:42,441
Hey, l guess l didn't get the ponytail memo.

136
00:08:43,547 --> 00:08:46,846
-Oh, my gosh, that was a lame joke.
-lt was lame.

137
00:08:47,017 --> 00:08:50,282
Okay, guys, listen up.
Let's continue listing adverbs.

138
00:08:53,090 --> 00:08:55,354
-Good job. Next?
-Hi.

00:08:55,526 --> 00:08:58,154
Yes, come on, honey. Punch in your code.

141
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:06,097
-Chrissa.
-That's your sister, right?

142
00:09:06,737 --> 00:09:08,967
Oh, look, Sonali. lt's your lunch buddy.

143
00:09:09,139 --> 00:09:11,733
ls she going to sit here?

144
00:09:15,012 --> 00:09:16,172
Don't look at her.

145
00:09:51,682 --> 00:09:53,115
Hi.

146
00:10:01,291 --> 00:10:03,885
You're in my class, aren't you?

147
00:10:07,898 --> 00:10:09,559
Yeah.

148
00:10:10,667 --> 00:10:12,601

Thank you very much, Karen,
that was lovely. Thank you.

154
00:11:00,083 --> 00:11:04,042
Let's see. Which artiste

155
00:11:05,322 --> 00:11:07,085
How about Jayden?

156
00:11:11,295 --> 00:11:15,163
l saw you were very busy back there, Jayden.
What did you make for us?

157
00:11:15,332 --> 00:11:18,927
Well, something
that makes my life special is...

158
00:11:19,736 --> 00:11:21,260
...my cell phone.

159
00:11:21,438 --> 00:11:23,099
-Bling-y.
-Cool.

160
00:11:23,540 --> 00:11:27,135
And how does your cell phone
make your life special?

161
00:11:29,046 --> 00:11:32,209
Well, it's pink with sparkles.

162
00:11:32,382 --> 00:11:35,681
And it has a thousand free minutes
l can use whichever way l want.

163
00:11:35,853 --> 00:11:37,115
Thank you, Jayden.

164
00:11:38,922 --> 00:11:40,651
Thank you very much.

165
00:11:43,427 --> 00:11:47,056
How about our new student, Chrissa Maxwell?

166
00:11:47,231 --> 00:11:49,199
Chrissa?

167
00:11:52,736 --> 00:11:57,002
What makes my life special is my friends.

168
00:11:58,842 --> 00:12:01,333
This is me and this is my best friend, Amanda.

169
00:12:02,312 --> 00:12:05,713
-And what are you doing there?
-We're all swimming with our friends.

170
00:12:05,883 --> 00:12:09,444
And our friends do make our lives special,
don't they?

171
00:12:10,854 --> 00:12:14,153
Very nice. Lovely, lovely composition.
Lovely use of color.

172
00:12:14,324 --> 00:12:17,157
Thank you, Chrissa, that was lovely.
Thank you.

173
00:12:17,327 --> 00:12:19,352
Thank you.

174
00:12:24,868 --> 00:12:26,631
Who's next?

175
00:12:27,771 --> 00:12:30,103
Happy Valentine's Day.

176
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:38,211
Guys, listen.

177
00:12:39,249 --> 00:12:41,114
<i>Roses are red</i>
<i>Violets are blue</i>

178
00:12:41,285 --> 00:12:43,651
<i>You're the loser girl</i>
<i>And no one likes you</i>

179
00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:48,314
''Ha, ha. Just kidding.
Happy Valentine's Day, from you-know-who.''

180
00:12:50,394 --> 00:12:54,262
You go send it. You know who.

181
00:12:55,532 --> 00:12:56,829
Watch this.

182
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,560
Happy Valentine's Day.

183
00:13:01,905 --> 00:13:03,065
Wait till she opens it.

184
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:06,835
Happy when she gets it,
sad when she reads it.

185
00:13:11,381 --> 00:13:16,011
Okay, guys. lt's time to open the mailboxes.

186
00:13:16,186 --> 00:13:19,087
-Finally.
-l'll even open mine.

187
00:13:19,256 --> 00:13:22,089
-l have so many.
-l know, it's overflowing.

188
00:13:22,259 --> 00:13:23,954
-Flowing.
-Flowing.

189
00:13:24,127 --> 00:13:25,856
Yeah.

190
00:13:26,029 --> 00:13:29,123
You didn't get any valentines. How sad.

191
00:13:31,935 --> 00:13:33,596
-Homemade, huh?
-Yeah.

192
00:13:33,770 --> 00:13:36,864
-l like making them myself.
-Really? l like buying them way better.

193
00:13:38,241 --> 00:13:42,302
-Hey, maybe yours all fell on the floor.
-Yeah.

194
00:13:50,420 --> 00:13:53,548
-She believed it.
-l can't believe she fell for it.

195
00:13:53,724 --> 00:13:58,889
Well, we can't have anyone in our club
who didn't get any valentines, can we?

196
00:13:59,062 --> 00:14:00,654
No.

197
00:14:00,831 --> 00:14:02,628
We can't.

198
00:14:06,103 --> 00:14:09,470
We can't have anyone who didn't get
any valentines in our club...

199
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:11,107
...now, can we, girls?

200
00:14:11,274 --> 00:14:13,333
-No, we can't.
-No, sorry.

201
00:14:15,812 --> 00:14:18,303
Who said l wanna be in your club anyway?

202
00:14:31,461 --> 00:14:35,864
Guys, remember. Swim club at
the community center starts in two weeks.

203
00:14:36,033 --> 00:14:38,968
-Permission slips are due tomorrow.
-Think you're gonna try out?

204
00:14:39,136 --> 00:14:40,797
Try out? l'm the star swimmer.

205
00:14:41,271 --> 00:14:43,796
Oh, you're-- Right, you're just kidding.

206
00:14:46,243 --> 00:14:49,940
Jayden! Come on!

207
00:14:53,817 --> 00:14:55,546
Chrissa. Everything okay?

208
00:14:58,488 --> 00:15:00,012
Yeah.

209
00:15:01,792 --> 00:15:03,817
Have a nice weekend, Mr. Beck.

210
00:15:04,394 --> 00:15:05,793
Thank you.

211
00:15:14,871 --> 00:15:17,339
Tyler. Tyler.

212
00:15:17,507 --> 00:15:18,633
So how'd you do?

213
00:15:18,809 --> 00:15:21,243
-No complaints.
-Hi, Tyler.

214
00:15:21,411 --> 00:15:23,936
-Hi.
-l heard you're new.

215
00:15:25,949 --> 00:15:28,474
-l can't believe he fell for it.
-l know.

216
00:15:28,652 --> 00:15:30,517
-Boys are dumb.
-Don't trust them, Tyler.

217
00:15:30,687 --> 00:15:32,814
-What?
-Believe me, okay?

218
00:15:32,989 --> 00:15:35,753
-They can't be trusted.
-Don't be such a headcase.

219
00:15:35,926 --> 00:15:38,053
Gwen. l love the hat.

220
00:15:38,228 --> 00:15:41,720
-Gwen, up here.
-l can't believe you have that outfit.

221
00:15:41,898 --> 00:15:44,833
-So?
-Oh, are you near her?

222
00:15:46,903 --> 00:15:48,871
-Like the loser.
-Oh, she's leaving.

223
00:15:51,374 --> 00:15:53,569
-Oh, poor Gwen.
-She's a loser.

224
00:15:53,744 --> 00:15:55,712
Loser.

225
00:16:41,291 --> 00:16:43,122
-Close your eyes, everyone.
-Okay.

226
00:16:43,293 --> 00:16:45,227
-No peeking, no cheating.
-They're closed.

227
00:16:45,395 --> 00:16:47,556
-l know you.
-Now, don't cheat.

228
00:16:47,731 --> 00:16:49,665
-Okay.
-Okay, you can open them.

229
00:16:51,668 --> 00:16:54,728
l know it's your first Valentine's Day
without Grandpa, so....

230
00:16:54,905 --> 00:16:56,805
-We love you, Mom.
-Oh, that is so sweet.

231
00:16:56,973 --> 00:17:00,670
l will treasure this always. Oh, thank you.

232
00:17:00,844 --> 00:17:02,641
l cut out the cupid.

233
00:17:02,813 --> 00:17:06,647
Oh, it is the most beautiful cupid
l have ever seen.

234
00:17:06,817 --> 00:17:09,183
And this is for my ladies.

235
00:17:09,352 --> 00:17:12,185
-This is for you, Mom.
-Oh, chocolates, my undoing.

236
00:17:12,355 --> 00:17:15,188
-Thank you.
-Here you go, sweetie.

237
00:17:15,859 --> 00:17:17,952
Happy Valentine's Day.

238
00:17:20,897 --> 00:17:24,094
-This is for you, bug.
-Thank you.

239
00:17:24,267 --> 00:17:27,395
And they call Minnesota...?

240
00:17:28,972 --> 00:17:31,941
-The Gopher State. ''l gopher you.''
-There you go.

241
00:17:32,742 --> 00:17:37,111
They also call it the lutefisk capital
of the world.

242
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:40,841
-What's lutefisk?
-Air-dried whitefish.

243
00:17:41,017 --> 00:17:43,315
We can have some tomorrow if you like.

244
00:17:44,221 --> 00:17:46,849
-No, thank you.
-Okay, guys, l'm dying to know.

245
00:17:47,023 --> 00:17:49,617
-How was the first day of school?
-Oh, Mom.

246
00:17:49,793 --> 00:17:52,023
Okay, let's start with, how did math go?

247
00:17:52,195 --> 00:17:54,322
Okay,
l already know the math that we're doing.

248
00:17:54,497 --> 00:17:57,557
-That's good.
-He does not get that from me.

249
00:17:57,734 --> 00:18:00,931
And l met some really cool kids,
like this one guy named Joel.

250
00:18:01,104 --> 00:18:04,039
-And even Chrissa's friend said hi to me.
-No.

251
00:18:04,207 --> 00:18:08,234
No, they're not my friends.
They're just some kids in my class.

252
00:18:08,411 --> 00:18:11,403
You know, more and more parents
are homeschooling their children.

253
00:18:11,581 --> 00:18:15,483
And apparently the student's chance
of getting into a top college...

254
00:18:15,652 --> 00:18:18,553
...is increased by 1 2 percent
when the student is homeschooled.

255
00:18:18,722 --> 00:18:20,849
-Really?
-Did something happen today, honey?

256
00:18:22,459 --> 00:18:25,451
No, l just miss Amanda and my friends.

257
00:18:25,629 --> 00:18:29,156
Oh, yeah. l wanna join the swim club.
They even let you dive.

258
00:18:29,332 --> 00:18:30,424
That is so cool.

259
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:33,000
Actually, l was thinking of joining too.

260
00:18:33,169 --> 00:18:36,104
-That'd be great.
-Why do you have to be such a copycat?

261
00:18:36,273 --> 00:18:38,707
l'm sure the pool is big enough
for the both of you.

262
00:18:38,875 --> 00:18:40,467
-l'll get it.
-Chrissa...

263
00:18:40,644 --> 00:18:44,011
...l'll bet you can't join the school swim club
if you're homeschooled.

264
00:18:44,180 --> 00:18:45,204
l bet you can.

265
00:18:46,850 --> 00:18:50,513
-Twenty bucks?
-Chrissa, it's one of your friends.

266
00:18:51,121 --> 00:18:55,057
Hey, go on. Go on.

267
00:18:55,225 --> 00:18:57,750
-lt's one of your friends.
-Okay.

268
00:18:57,928 --> 00:19:00,954
lnvite her in for dessert.

269
00:19:05,669 --> 00:19:06,761
Hi.

270
00:19:07,604 --> 00:19:10,937
Hi. These are yours.

271
00:19:19,149 --> 00:19:20,377
My valentines?

272
00:19:21,384 --> 00:19:23,375
l'm supposed to say l'm sorry.

273
00:19:28,858 --> 00:19:30,325
Why did you take them?

274
00:19:31,261 --> 00:19:34,253
Tara told me to.
She thought it would be funny.

275
00:19:35,765 --> 00:19:37,494
So you do whatever she asks you?

276
00:19:38,101 --> 00:19:40,729
She said to take them home
and not say a word.

277
00:19:40,904 --> 00:19:43,236
But my mom found them.

278
00:19:44,808 --> 00:19:49,507
She made you return them.
Did she make you say you're sorry too?

279
00:19:50,413 --> 00:19:53,280
And if it makes you feel any better,
l'm grounded for a week.

280
00:19:55,151 --> 00:19:56,482
Well, l have to go.

281
00:19:58,254 --> 00:19:59,983
Bye.

282
00:20:03,426 --> 00:20:05,758
-Did you tell her you're sorry?
-Yes, Mom, l did.

283
00:20:05,929 --> 00:20:08,227
Get in the car.

284
00:20:13,236 --> 00:20:14,726
Oh, thanks, Louise.

285
00:20:14,904 --> 00:20:18,032
-Where do you want it?
-Put it right there, right on the table.

286
00:20:20,643 --> 00:20:25,171
-ls this for your show in Minneapolis?
-Yeah. You like it?

287
00:20:25,348 --> 00:20:28,681
You know, just the other day,
l was bragging about how talented you are.

288
00:20:28,852 --> 00:20:30,479
That's nice.

289
00:20:31,054 --> 00:20:33,818
And also how you love helping others.

290
00:20:35,492 --> 00:20:38,393
Okay, Louise. Spill it.

291
00:20:39,062 --> 00:20:41,792
Well, l'm on the board
of our local homeless shelter...

292
00:20:41,965 --> 00:20:44,627
...and we're having our annual fundraiser.

293
00:20:44,801 --> 00:20:48,737
Every year, people come and buy
a very expensive soup-bowl dinner...

294
00:20:48,905 --> 00:20:52,898
...and they get to take the bowl home
with them. lt's a very festive affair.

295
00:20:53,510 --> 00:20:55,273
Sounds fun.

296
00:20:55,445 --> 00:20:59,609
And you know what l think
would be perfectly wonderful?

297
00:20:59,783 --> 00:21:01,045
What?

298
00:21:01,217 --> 00:21:05,881
Well, l was thinking,
why not have one-of-a-kind soup bowls...

299
00:21:06,056 --> 00:21:09,025
...created by a real artist
as a special thank-you.

300
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:12,619
Okay...?

301
00:21:12,796 --> 00:21:15,788
So l was mentioning this and someone said:

302
00:21:15,965 --> 00:21:20,231
''Why not have your son-in-law,
who's a famous ceramicist, make them?''

303
00:21:20,403 --> 00:21:23,201
Of course l said l couldn't possibly impose.

304
00:21:26,342 --> 00:21:27,502
Okay, Louise, l'll do it.

305
00:21:29,012 --> 00:21:31,207
We'll need 1 20 or so.

306
00:21:31,381 --> 00:21:33,611
Wait. Louise? Louise?

307
00:21:34,584 --> 00:21:36,415
-When?
-Six weeks.

308
00:21:36,586 --> 00:21:39,384
Oh, gee. l get a whole six weeks.

309
00:21:40,223 --> 00:21:41,815
Thank you.

310
00:21:47,697 --> 00:21:49,358
Hi, Gwen.

311
00:21:50,033 --> 00:21:51,898
Oh, don't go.

312
00:21:53,369 --> 00:21:55,803
l brought you some of my nana's cookies.

313
00:21:55,972 --> 00:21:57,633
They're really good.

314
00:21:59,142 --> 00:22:01,872
-Why, thank you, Chrissa.
-Thanks, Chrissa.

315
00:22:02,045 --> 00:22:03,774
Chocolate.

316
00:22:04,747 --> 00:22:06,908
-Thank you.
-Good one, Tara.

317
00:22:09,719 --> 00:22:11,209
Nana packed two bags.

318
00:22:18,394 --> 00:22:20,123
They're good.

319
00:22:25,401 --> 00:22:27,733
There you go, babies.

320
00:22:27,904 --> 00:22:31,135
-Oh, hi, Nana.
-Hi, honey.

321
00:22:31,307 --> 00:22:34,799
-l joined the swim team.
-Excellent.

322
00:22:35,145 --> 00:22:37,136
Hey. How's the baby?

323
00:22:37,313 --> 00:22:40,248
-Oh, she's hungry.
-Hey.

324
00:22:40,950 --> 00:22:44,181
-Are you okay, Nana?
-Oh, yes.

325
00:22:44,354 --> 00:22:46,185
l was just thinking about your grandpa.

326
00:22:46,356 --> 00:22:48,620
How much he would have loved
having you all here.

327
00:22:49,492 --> 00:22:51,790
-Would you get me that pail?
-Yeah.

328
00:22:57,967 --> 00:23:00,936
You know, it was his idea
to get these mini llamas.

329
00:23:01,104 --> 00:23:02,867
-Grandpa's?
-Yeah.

330
00:23:03,039 --> 00:23:06,770
-And you know why we got two?
-So that they can have babies?

331
00:23:06,943 --> 00:23:13,041
No. Because llamas are very social animals.
They don't do well by themselves.

332
00:23:13,216 --> 00:23:16,344
They always need to have a best friend
near them.

333
00:23:17,487 --> 00:23:18,818
Was Grandpa your best friend?

334
00:23:21,024 --> 00:23:23,049
Well, yes, he was.

335
00:23:24,961 --> 00:23:28,488
-l miss my best friends too.
-Oh, l know you do, sweetie.

336
00:23:29,465 --> 00:23:32,127
But you wanna know the best cure for that?

337
00:23:32,302 --> 00:23:34,827
Find someone else
who needs a good friend too.

338
00:23:38,808 --> 00:23:43,006
Hey, ladies. You're getting--
You're getting alfalfa in your hair.

339
00:23:43,646 --> 00:23:45,136
You're ruining your hairdo.

340
00:23:47,917 --> 00:23:51,375
Okay, whoever has permission slips
for swim club, last chance.

341
00:23:51,554 --> 00:23:53,249
-Pass them up.

-Here you go, Mr. Beck.

00:24:09,672 --> 00:24:13,768
Now l need somebody
to take these to the office.

347
00:24:14,877 --> 00:24:17,869
Chrissa, why don't you give it a shot?

348
00:24:18,314 --> 00:24:22,250
-Okay.
-Thank you, Tara.

349
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:25,717

-Remember where the office is?
-Yeah.

00:24:30,793 --> 00:24:33,785
Okay, page 21 9, guys.

352
00:24:43,206 --> 00:24:46,403
Let's do a little review on inequalities
and the rules thereof.

353
00:24:46,576 --> 00:24:50,273
Mr. Beck, may l please go to the restroom?

354
00:25:34,324 --> 00:25:37,191
Hey, what's that?

355
00:25:42,398 --> 00:25:45,697
Wasn't this supposed to go
straight to the office?

356
00:25:47,337 --> 00:25:51,933
What to do, what to do?

357
00:26:18,368 --> 00:26:20,928
-Thank you, Tara.
-You're welcome.

358
00:26:21,337 --> 00:26:24,329
Tara. Tara, why did you take
that envelope?

359
00:26:24,507 --> 00:26:26,805
Why did you leave it laying
on the bathroom floor?

360
00:26:27,176 --> 00:26:31,510
l took care of it.
That was very irresponsible of you.

361
00:26:32,715 --> 00:26:37,846
Don't worry, l didn't tell on you.
l'm not a tattletale.

362
00:26:45,728 --> 00:26:47,753
Okay, Alexandra...

363
00:26:47,930 --> 00:26:50,421

Okay, guys, we got a team.
Let's stretch it out, warm it up.

365
00:26:54,937 --> 00:26:57,428
Chrissa, hang on, l wanna talk to you.

366
00:26:57,607 --> 00:27:00,337
-Didn't you give me a permission slip?
-Yeah, you saw me.

367
00:27:00,510 --> 00:27:02,740
-Well, it's not here.
-But it has to be.

368
00:27:02,912 --> 00:27:05,847
Well, l'm sorry. No permission slip,
you can't swim.

369
00:27:06,015 --> 00:27:08,813
You're gonna have to sit this one out.
l'm sorry.

370
00:27:09,218 --> 00:27:11,846
Okay, girls, breaststroke.

371
00:27:12,021 --> 00:27:14,285
Five-zero meters.

372
00:27:14,724 --> 00:27:17,852
Swimmers, take your marks. Let's go.

373
00:27:18,060 --> 00:27:21,689
Boys, keep stretching.
l don't want any injuries this year.

374
00:27:21,864 --> 00:27:26,767
Guys, listen for the whistle.
No false starts today.

375
00:27:26,936 --> 00:27:29,268
-What happened?
-lt's important to keep stretching.

376
00:27:29,439 --> 00:27:32,670
-lt's okay. Just go.
-Okay, guys, give me good strong kicks.

377
00:27:32,842 --> 00:27:35,402
Fundamentals are very important.

378
00:27:35,578 --> 00:27:38,103
Okay, swimmers, take your mark.

379
00:27:46,355 --> 00:27:52,658
Did you or did you not steal
my client's permission slip?

380
00:27:54,297 --> 00:27:56,094
l....

381
00:27:57,066 --> 00:28:01,230
Okay, l did it, l did it, l did it.

382
00:28:01,404 --> 00:28:04,134
Guilty, guilty, guilty.

383
00:28:04,307 --> 00:28:07,834
The court sentences you
to 1 01 years of detention.

384
00:28:08,177 --> 00:28:10,645
No, please, no, no.

385
00:28:10,813 --> 00:28:12,178
No, no!

386
00:28:12,348 --> 00:28:13,645

387
00:28:14,016 --> 00:28:15,074
No!

388
00:28:17,787 --> 00:28:20,278
Strong kicks, guys. Pull!

389
00:28:20,456 --> 00:28:23,152
Pull it through. Nice. Very nice.

390
00:28:23,326 --> 00:28:25,760
Great job, Tara.

391
00:28:26,095 --> 00:28:27,722
-Thanks.
-You're looking stronger...

392
00:28:27,897 --> 00:28:30,331
...than you were last year. Keep it up.

393
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:34,527
Okay, boys, shake it out.
Let's hit the marks.

394
00:28:34,704 --> 00:28:39,164
-Amanda, they act like they rule the school.
-<i>Oh, real queen bees, huh?</i>

395
00:28:39,342 --> 00:28:42,937
Mean bees, is more like it.
And the head mean bee is so--

396
00:28:43,112 --> 00:28:45,342
<i>Oh, so the queens have a boss?</i>

397
00:28:46,048 --> 00:28:48,642
Yeah. She's the queen
of the mean queen bees.

398
00:28:48,818 --> 00:28:51,981
Anyway, she's the one
who's been doing all the mean things.

399
00:28:52,388 --> 00:28:55,949
<i>You can't tell on her, because</i>
<i>everyone will think you're a tattletale,</i>

400
00:28:56,125 --> 00:28:58,389
<i>So just try to ignore her,</i>

401
00:28:58,561 --> 00:29:01,155
l know. You're right.

402
00:29:02,098 --> 00:29:04,726
-l really miss you, Amanda.
-<i>I miss you too,</i>

403
00:29:04,901 --> 00:29:07,699
<i>But it'll be summer before you know it,</i>
<i>And I'm coming there,</i>

404
00:29:07,870 --> 00:29:10,600
<i>I can't wait to see you</i>
<i>and your new house,</i>

405
00:29:10,773 --> 00:29:15,176
l can't wait, either.
And don't forget, it's Llama Central.

406
00:29:15,344 --> 00:29:19,144
-Chrissa, Tyler, it's dinner.
-Oh, l gotta go, okay?

407
00:29:19,315 --> 00:29:21,579
-Okay. Bye.
-<i>Bye,</i>

408
00:29:21,984 --> 00:29:24,214
So how was school today?

409
00:29:24,387 --> 00:29:28,153
Mom, when are you gonna realize that
that's the question every kid hates?

410
00:29:28,324 --> 00:29:30,053
l still wanna know.

411
00:29:30,226 --> 00:29:31,750
-lt was okay.
-lt was fine.

412
00:29:32,128 --> 00:29:33,493
Just okay?

413
00:29:33,663 --> 00:29:36,291
Oh, hey, today was the first day
of swim practice, right?

414
00:29:36,465 --> 00:29:40,060
-Yeah. You know they have a high dive?
-That is cool.

415
00:29:40,670 --> 00:29:44,071
-So how'd it go?
-Good.

416
00:29:46,475 --> 00:29:49,410
By the way, you have to sign
another permission slip.

417
00:29:49,579 --> 00:29:53,140
Have you guys thought of a name
for the baby llama yet?

418
00:29:53,316 --> 00:29:56,376
Well, so far we have...

419
00:29:57,119 --> 00:30:02,079
-...Bubba, Claude, Cynthia and Minnie.
-Cynthia. Minnie.

420
00:30:02,258 --> 00:30:04,692
Minnie, the mini llama?

421
00:30:04,860 --> 00:30:06,122
That was my idea.

422
00:30:07,163 --> 00:30:09,222
You know what your grandpa
was gonna call it?

423
00:30:09,398 --> 00:30:11,229
-What?
-Starburst.

424
00:30:14,136 --> 00:30:16,661
-That's perfect.
-Oh, that's perfect, yeah.

425
00:30:38,828 --> 00:30:40,455
Hey, good morning.

426
00:30:41,397 --> 00:30:43,160
-Hey.
-Here's your coffee.

427
00:30:43,332 --> 00:30:46,165
Oh, thank you. Hold it just a minute.

428
00:30:46,335 --> 00:30:47,563
What are you making?

429
00:30:48,270 --> 00:30:50,033
-Well, l'm helping Nana.
-Yeah?

430
00:30:50,206 --> 00:30:53,801
She's putting together a fundraiser
for the homeless shelter.

431
00:30:57,680 --> 00:31:01,013
You can get a lot of money
for all these bowls.

432
00:31:01,183 --> 00:31:03,174
-Well, do you think l can help?
-Positively.

433
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:05,912
Take the air out of that old clay.

434
00:31:06,088 --> 00:31:07,988
-Okay. Ready?
-Yeah. Pound it good.

435
00:31:10,292 --> 00:31:12,260
You know what happens
if you get a bubble?

436
00:31:12,428 --> 00:31:16,228
Yes. Otherwise, it explodes.

437
00:31:20,069 --> 00:31:22,401
Oh, you know what?
l'll tell you what.

438
00:31:22,571 --> 00:31:26,598
You and Tyler can help me paint the glazes.
That's when l'm really gonna need the help.

439
00:31:26,776 --> 00:31:29,006
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

440
00:31:29,445 --> 00:31:32,881
Hey, maybe l could ask some of the kids
in my art class to come and help.

441
00:31:33,049 --> 00:31:35,745
-Oh, that would be perfect, wouldn't it?
-Yeah.

442
00:31:35,918 --> 00:31:38,978
Yeah, because then you'd get to know
some of the other kids better.

443
00:31:39,155 --> 00:31:41,555
-Dad.
-Yeah. All help accepted.

444
00:31:45,461 --> 00:31:49,397
-Pass me that brush and l'll shape it a little.
-Yeah. There you go.

445
00:31:58,974 --> 00:32:02,171
You know, Chrissa, you're a lot like me.

446
00:32:02,344 --> 00:32:04,073
l am?

447
00:32:05,314 --> 00:32:07,680
Well, you know how Tyler just jumps in?

448
00:32:07,850 --> 00:32:10,842
l mean, he's already made
a whole lot of friends.

449
00:32:12,521 --> 00:32:15,490
Well, you and l...

450
00:32:16,525 --> 00:32:18,584
...we like to test the waters first.

451
00:32:18,761 --> 00:32:21,889
You know, see what
the temperature is like.

452
00:32:22,064 --> 00:32:25,659
-l guess so.
-Yeah. lt's a good strategy.

453
00:32:25,835 --> 00:32:29,236
But once you've tested the waters...

454
00:32:30,606 --> 00:32:33,268
...you gotta be ready.
You gotta just dive right in.

455
00:32:35,144 --> 00:32:36,736
Okay.

456
00:32:39,648 --> 00:32:41,479
Pound that clay.

457
00:32:42,518 --> 00:32:44,213
Chrissa, you're up.

458
00:32:44,954 --> 00:32:48,754
Excuse me? Excuse me, you guys.

459
00:32:49,692 --> 00:32:52,627
My dad's working on bowls for a fundraiser
at the Sunrise House.

460
00:32:52,795 --> 00:32:54,626
He needs help painting and glazing.

461
00:32:54,797 --> 00:32:57,925
lf anyone wants to come by
my dad's studio on Saturday and help...

462
00:32:58,100 --> 00:32:59,965
-...it would be appreciated.
-Oh, my God.

463
00:33:00,136 --> 00:33:02,536
-Class?
-Sounds super...

464
00:33:02,705 --> 00:33:04,639
...boring.

465
00:33:05,407 --> 00:33:08,467
l thought l saw some hands over here.
Who's first?

466
00:33:08,644 --> 00:33:11,078
Just sign up and pass it along.

467
00:33:12,448 --> 00:33:16,942
-Sonali.
-l thought l might find the time.

468
00:33:20,055 --> 00:33:21,955
Gwen, can you come?

469
00:33:22,124 --> 00:33:24,592
Maybe you can stay overnight too.

470
00:33:25,094 --> 00:33:27,221
l don't think so.

471
00:33:27,797 --> 00:33:29,162
But thanks.

472
00:33:31,033 --> 00:33:36,938
Loser 1 's making friends with Loser 2.
How sweet.

473
00:33:38,808 --> 00:33:40,537
What?

474
00:33:47,016 --> 00:33:48,779
Did you see her face?

475
00:33:49,485 --> 00:33:51,976
Totally pathetic.

476
00:34:56,752 --> 00:34:58,743
Thanks.

477
00:34:58,921 --> 00:35:00,946
Gwen, you're really good.

478
00:35:01,423 --> 00:35:03,391
l used to have a violin.

479
00:35:03,559 --> 00:35:05,823
Well, what happened to it?

480
00:35:09,598 --> 00:35:11,122
Gwen?

481
00:35:18,374 --> 00:35:21,036
My mom's waiting for me outside.

482
00:35:22,678 --> 00:35:24,737

00:36:24,974 --> 00:36:26,874
Where did you learn
how to swim like that?

499
00:36:27,042 --> 00:36:30,068
-At the lake back at the house.
-We're gonna work on those turns.

500
00:36:30,245 --> 00:36:32,770
You're gonna be a force
to be reckoned with. Good job.

-Keep stretching, guys. Good work.

503
00:36:38,087 --> 00:36:41,545
You know, l let you win.
l don't really try until the competition.

504
00:36:41,724 --> 00:36:44,352
You know, Chrissa,
l'm gonna put you on the relay team...

505
00:36:44,526 --> 00:36:47,620
...with Tara, Alexandra and Rachel, okay?
You're gonna swim second.

506
00:36:47,796 --> 00:36:49,457
-Second?
-Good job.

507
00:36:49,631 --> 00:36:52,259
That's where they put
the weakest swimmer.

508
00:36:53,102 --> 00:36:55,195
Bend down and touch your toes.

509
00:37:03,012 --> 00:37:04,673
Hey, you guys see my clothes?

510
00:37:04,847 --> 00:37:08,112
-No.
-No, sorry.

511
00:37:15,958 --> 00:37:18,256
Come on, Sally, let's go.

512
00:37:20,763 --> 00:37:25,166
Gee, Chrissa, something really stinks.

513
00:37:26,001 --> 00:37:29,129
Hey, Rachel, wait up.

514
00:37:55,264 --> 00:37:57,960
''ldentify the....''

515
00:37:58,867 --> 00:38:02,963
''Confect a diagram to identify
the things that are alike...

516
00:38:03,138 --> 00:38:05,606
...and the things that are different.''

517
00:38:05,774 --> 00:38:07,833
Hi, darling.

518
00:38:08,210 --> 00:38:10,303
How was school today?

519
00:38:10,479 --> 00:38:12,071
lt was okay.

520
00:38:17,086 --> 00:38:20,214
lf there were something wrong, sweetie,
you'd tell me, wouldn't you?

521
00:38:23,725 --> 00:38:25,750
lt's just so hard, Mom.

522
00:38:25,928 --> 00:38:29,056
And l can't seem to make any friends,
and nobody likes me.

523
00:38:29,498 --> 00:38:31,261
Nobody?

524
00:38:31,433 --> 00:38:34,994
l even found a person
who looked like they needed a friend.

525
00:38:35,237 --> 00:38:37,034
Even she doesn't want me as a friend.

526
00:38:39,475 --> 00:38:43,036
Well, Chrissa, maybe there's something
going on with her that you don't know.

527
00:38:45,380 --> 00:38:47,871
You mean, maybe it isn't me?

528
00:38:48,851 --> 00:38:50,478
Have you done anything to her?

529
00:38:51,553 --> 00:38:53,817
-No.
-Then it isn't you.

530
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:00,323
l didn't think of it like that.

531
00:39:00,496 --> 00:39:04,091
Look, if you really like this girl,
then you shouldn't give up.

532
00:39:06,502 --> 00:39:09,266
-Thanks, Mom.
-l love you.

533
00:39:09,438 --> 00:39:12,202
-You too.
-What are you working on?

534
00:39:12,374 --> 00:39:15,866
-Well, on my diag--
-Did you get an A?

535
00:39:16,044 --> 00:39:18,410
-Your--?
-We did, like, a class thing...

536
00:39:18,580 --> 00:39:21,913
...that he had us write,
like, a little report while we're in class.

537
00:39:27,823 --> 00:39:29,984
-Paul?
-Yeah?

538
00:39:30,159 --> 00:39:33,686
-There's something going on with Chrissa.
-Really? What?

539
00:39:34,663 --> 00:39:35,994
That's just it, l don't know.

540
00:39:36,165 --> 00:39:38,690
l figure out people's life problems
all the time...

541
00:39:38,867 --> 00:39:42,530
...and l can't figure out what's bothering
my 1 0-year-old daughter.

542
00:39:43,005 --> 00:39:47,135
Listen, she just needs time to adjust,
that's all.

543
00:39:47,309 --> 00:39:48,970
Tyler already has new friends.

544
00:39:49,144 --> 00:39:51,942
Yeah, well. Come on, Meg,
Chrissa's not Tyler.

545
00:39:53,282 --> 00:39:55,716
Has she said anything to you?

546
00:39:55,884 --> 00:39:57,351
Yeah. Yeah, we talk.

547
00:39:57,519 --> 00:40:00,579
You know, just....

548
00:40:00,756 --> 00:40:02,348
Listen.

549
00:40:03,592 --> 00:40:06,425
Honey, she's just figuring it out,
that's all.

550
00:40:06,595 --> 00:40:08,859
Yeah, but she's not happy.

551
00:40:09,965 --> 00:40:12,866
Was coming here a mistake?
l took this job because l thought...

552
00:40:13,035 --> 00:40:16,801
...it would give me more family time
and would help out my mom.

553
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:19,971
lt will.

554
00:40:20,142 --> 00:40:22,508
You know what? You're the new kid too.

555
00:40:22,678 --> 00:40:25,340
And your mom needs us.

556
00:40:26,148 --> 00:40:30,050
l tell you what. lf anything were bothering
her, she'd come, she'd talk to us.

557
00:40:30,219 --> 00:40:34,019
So l trust her on that.

558
00:40:34,189 --> 00:40:36,020
Come here.

559
00:40:36,491 --> 00:40:39,016
Okay.

560
00:40:39,328 --> 00:40:41,762
Very nice, you guys. Very nice.

561
00:40:41,930 --> 00:40:44,694
Anybody want some lemonade here?

562
00:40:44,866 --> 00:40:46,857
-Okay.
-Just watch me. Watch me now.

563
00:40:47,035 --> 00:40:50,596
-Just take-- Kids?
-How about you?

564
00:40:51,940 --> 00:40:54,534
Dude, that's the worst-looking hamburger
l've ever seen.

565
00:40:54,710 --> 00:40:57,008
That's because it's a spaceship.

566
00:40:59,715 --> 00:41:03,674
-Yeah, l see that.
-Anybody want some lemonade here?

567
00:41:03,852 --> 00:41:06,013
Nice hamburger.

568
00:41:13,328 --> 00:41:17,025
l can tell you've done this before.
That's really pretty.

569
00:41:17,199 --> 00:41:20,191
Thanks. Yeah, l've been doing it
since l was 3.

570
00:41:20,369 --> 00:41:22,064
Or possibly before that.

571
00:41:29,077 --> 00:41:31,409
l'm surprised you came
without Tara or Jayden.

572
00:41:32,414 --> 00:41:35,076
l know. lt seems like
we're always together.

573
00:41:35,250 --> 00:41:37,741
We've been friends since preschool.

574
00:41:37,919 --> 00:41:39,853
Or possibly before that.

575
00:41:42,824 --> 00:41:45,554
l had friends like that back at home.

576
00:41:46,128 --> 00:41:49,791
You know, Tara's mad
you're such a good swimmer.

577
00:41:51,833 --> 00:41:53,425
-Here, put that down.
-What?

578
00:41:53,602 --> 00:41:55,763
-l wanna show you something.
-Okay.

579
00:41:55,937 --> 00:41:57,837
-Take this off.
-Okay, where are we going?

580
00:41:58,006 --> 00:42:00,474
-Come on, just follow me.
-Okay.

581
00:42:04,313 --> 00:42:06,304
Just one second. Come on.

582
00:42:06,848 --> 00:42:10,181
Okay, come on in.
Gently, gently. She's very shy.

583
00:42:10,352 --> 00:42:12,946
-lt is so cute.
-Thanks.

584
00:42:13,121 --> 00:42:14,645
My grandpa named her Starburst.

585
00:42:16,992 --> 00:42:19,688
-What's this?
-Llama beans.

586
00:42:21,530 --> 00:42:23,361
Llama poop.

587
00:42:24,466 --> 00:42:26,491
Okay.

588
00:42:27,636 --> 00:42:30,662
You know, llama beans
are a perfect fertilizer.

589
00:42:30,839 --> 00:42:34,707
-ls she eating my shirt?
-No, she's kissing you.

590
00:42:34,876 --> 00:42:36,537
That's how llama's kiss. Here.

591
00:42:42,184 --> 00:42:44,379
l heard you ask Gwen to stay overnight.

592
00:42:45,787 --> 00:42:47,220
Yeah.

593
00:42:48,090 --> 00:42:51,685
-Well, where is she?
-l don't know.

594
00:42:53,161 --> 00:42:57,791
l know you're not supposed
to invite yourself over...

595
00:42:58,066 --> 00:43:01,467
...but maybe l could stay
overnight sometime?

596
00:43:02,037 --> 00:43:04,198
Well, what would Tara and Jayden say?

597
00:43:04,373 --> 00:43:06,307
l don't have to tell them.

598
00:43:10,278 --> 00:43:12,246
Yeah.

599
00:43:12,414 --> 00:43:15,850
Well, this one's the mama.
Her name's Cosmos, right there.

600
00:43:16,017 --> 00:43:19,180
And this is Checkers.

601
00:43:21,123 --> 00:43:23,091
Come on. Come on, guys.

602
00:43:23,258 --> 00:43:26,887
Pull, pull. Come on.

603
00:43:27,062 --> 00:43:30,998
-Yes, pull it up.
-<i>Wins the 50-meter freestyle,,,</i>

00:43:31,166 --> 00:43:33,566

-<i>Next race: girls 50-meter freestyle,</i>
-Nice work, guys.

606
00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:41,440
Swimmers, take you mark.

607
00:43:41,610 --> 00:43:43,669
-Hey, Chrissa?
-Yeah.

608
00:43:43,845 --> 00:43:46,211
l expect to win this.

609
00:43:49,184 --> 00:43:50,913
-Come on, go!
-Go, Tara.

610
00:43:51,086 --> 00:43:53,452
-Come on, Chrissa.
-Go, go.

611
00:43:56,425 --> 00:43:59,053
Go, Tara! Come on, Tara!

612
00:44:23,718 --> 00:44:25,709
-Come on, sweetie.
-Pull! Pull!

613
00:44:25,887 --> 00:44:27,878
Pull!

614
00:44:51,847 --> 00:44:58,082
<i>Tara James wins the 50-meter freestyle</i>
<i>for the Tigers,</i>

615
00:44:59,788 --> 00:45:02,256
-Yeah, Tara!
-Good choice.

616
00:45:30,318 --> 00:45:35,950
-Am l in trouble?
-No, no, no.

617
00:45:41,263 --> 00:45:42,389
lt's just....

618
00:45:45,400 --> 00:45:47,664
ls there something going on
with your sister?

619
00:45:48,436 --> 00:45:49,460
Like what?

620
00:45:49,638 --> 00:45:51,902
She didn't seem that happy
after the meet today.

621
00:45:52,073 --> 00:45:56,908
-Well, that's because she could have won.
-Oh, Tyler, she did very well.

622
00:45:57,078 --> 00:46:00,536
-She could have done better.
-But she hasn't been swimming that long.

623
00:46:00,715 --> 00:46:04,310
Trust me, Mom. She's really, really fast
when she wants to be.

624
00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:07,420
Really?

625
00:46:09,624 --> 00:46:11,819
-So homework?
-Oh, yeah.

626
00:46:13,361 --> 00:46:16,353
Yeah. We are pro-homework.

627
00:46:16,531 --> 00:46:17,964
Good.

628
00:46:24,272 --> 00:46:26,172
-Yeah, just two more there.
-Right here?

629
00:46:26,341 --> 00:46:28,707
-Okay, you gotta line them up, Tyler.
-Sure, Dad.

630
00:46:28,877 --> 00:46:33,177
-Now, throw that paper over there, huh?
-Everybody? Everybody?

631
00:46:33,348 --> 00:46:35,839
May l have your attention, please?

632
00:46:36,017 --> 00:46:38,850
l just wanna thank you all
for being here today.

633
00:46:39,554 --> 00:46:43,285
l love this event.
lt just gets more exciting every year.

634
00:46:43,458 --> 00:46:47,053
Who knew when we started
that we would impact so many lives?

635
00:46:47,529 --> 00:46:50,464
And, this year, we have
the most amazing soup bowls...

636
00:46:50,632 --> 00:46:54,363
...thanks to my wonderful son-in-law
and my beautiful granddaughter...

637
00:46:54,536 --> 00:46:57,699
-...and her fourth-grade class.
-Yeah, Chrissa.

638
00:46:58,173 --> 00:47:00,038
l'd like to say something too.

639
00:47:00,809 --> 00:47:04,336
lt means so much to me
to be helping today...

640
00:47:04,512 --> 00:47:07,572
...because l'm one of the people
on the other side of the equation.

641
00:47:08,416 --> 00:47:12,785
Eighteen months ago,
l lost my husband and then my house.

642
00:47:12,954 --> 00:47:16,583
And then l simply had nowhere to go.

643
00:47:16,958 --> 00:47:19,927
The most terrifying part
is l had a daughter to raise.

644
00:47:20,495 --> 00:47:23,658
Sunrise House was a godsend.

645
00:47:23,832 --> 00:47:27,165
Here, my daughter could go to school
and l could find a job.

646
00:47:27,335 --> 00:47:32,329
My daughter and l are a living example
of the hard work you do here.

647
00:47:32,507 --> 00:47:38,639
And l just want you to know
that it's real, that it means something.

648
00:47:45,120 --> 00:47:48,487
Chrissa, you cannot tell anyone.

649
00:47:49,057 --> 00:47:52,288
l won't. l promise.

650
00:47:52,460 --> 00:47:55,156
ls this why you didn't wanna be friends?

651
00:47:56,798 --> 00:47:58,993
lt's embarrassing.

652
00:47:59,801 --> 00:48:02,770
When you ask me to come over...

653
00:48:03,605 --> 00:48:05,505
...l really can't ask you back.

654
00:48:05,974 --> 00:48:07,999
l want you to come over anyway.

655
00:48:13,848 --> 00:48:16,976
Gwen? We need more butterflies.

656
00:48:18,486 --> 00:48:20,283
Thank you.

657
00:48:27,829 --> 00:48:30,662
Okay, l'll write tonight's
homework assignment on the board.

658
00:48:30,832 --> 00:48:33,460
Guys, don't forget to check your spelling.

659
00:48:36,438 --> 00:48:38,668
Sonali, you can't tell anybody.

660
00:48:38,973 --> 00:48:41,635
Tell anybody about what?

661
00:48:41,810 --> 00:48:45,143
That Chrissa heard we have a pop quiz
in science tomorrow.

662
00:48:46,147 --> 00:48:50,811
-We already knew that.
-What? Oh, yeah, we already knew that.

663
00:48:51,753 --> 00:48:57,419
Okay, class, it is time to start thinking
about our big class project.

664
00:48:57,592 --> 00:49:02,154
Now, in the past, we've taken on things
like pollution, school safety.

665
00:49:02,597 --> 00:49:06,533
You guys get to pick.
So think it over, give it some thought...

666
00:49:06,701 --> 00:49:09,534
...and we'll talk about it
over the next couple days.

667
00:49:17,879 --> 00:49:19,471
-California?
-Sacramento.

668
00:49:19,647 --> 00:49:21,080
Good.

669
00:49:21,549 --> 00:49:23,574
-New York?
-Albany.

670
00:49:25,553 --> 00:49:30,581
-Alaska?
-Alaska? Alaska?

671
00:49:30,759 --> 00:49:32,727
-Juneau.
-Yes.

672
00:49:32,894 --> 00:49:35,362
Girls, dinner's in 1 0 minutes.

673
00:49:35,530 --> 00:49:38,124
-Okay, Mom.
-Okay, Mrs. Maxwell.

674
00:49:38,299 --> 00:49:42,793
-What about Ohio?
-Ohio?

675
00:49:47,909 --> 00:49:49,274
Hello?

676
00:49:49,911 --> 00:49:54,075
-Oh, hi.
-<i>I need you to come over tonight,</i>

677
00:49:54,249 --> 00:49:56,774
-Now?
-<i>Yes,</i>

678
00:49:56,951 --> 00:50:01,650
-Does it have to be now?
-<i>Yes, We have to study for our pop quiz,</i>

679
00:50:03,391 --> 00:50:07,418
-<i>Get on with it, would you?</i>
-Yeah, that will be okay.

680
00:50:08,429 --> 00:50:09,896
Bye.

681
00:50:11,399 --> 00:50:12,832
That was my mom.

682
00:50:14,235 --> 00:50:16,567
She has to pick me up now.

683
00:50:16,738 --> 00:50:20,265
-l thought you were gonna stay for dinner.
-Now l can't.

684
00:50:20,441 --> 00:50:21,931
Why?

685
00:50:22,644 --> 00:50:25,636
We have relatives coming over
all of a sudden.

686
00:50:26,247 --> 00:50:28,306
l have to go.

687
00:50:29,017 --> 00:50:30,541
Right now.

688
00:50:30,718 --> 00:50:32,208
Bye.

689
00:50:33,388 --> 00:50:34,855
Bye.

690
00:50:51,239 --> 00:50:52,501
-<i>Hello,</i>
-Hi.

691
00:50:52,674 --> 00:50:55,575
-Sonali?
-Mom, can you pick me up now?

692
00:50:55,743 --> 00:50:59,338
-Now? Why?
-l forgot l have to go Tara's house.

693
00:50:59,514 --> 00:51:01,482
You're supposed to stay there for dinner.

694
00:51:01,649 --> 00:51:05,016
-But she needs help with homework.
-Sonali, that is not your problem.

695
00:51:05,186 --> 00:51:07,381
Just come, okay?

696
00:51:23,872 --> 00:51:25,863
-Oh, my gosh. Guess what.
-What?

697
00:51:26,040 --> 00:51:29,601
My mom, she got the job she wanted,
and we're moving into an apartment.

698
00:51:29,777 --> 00:51:32,405
-And so it's out of the shelter?
-Yeah.

699
00:51:32,580 --> 00:51:34,844
Oh, my gosh. This is fantastic.

700
00:51:35,016 --> 00:51:36,881
Goodbye, Sunrise House.
Goodbye, dorm.

701
00:51:37,051 --> 00:51:39,747
Hello, my own room.

702
00:51:39,921 --> 00:51:42,446
We should have a party.
You know, like a, ''l'm moving.''

703
00:51:42,624 --> 00:51:44,455
Oh, my God, yeah.
No more Sunrise House.

704
00:51:44,626 --> 00:51:46,526
-Yeah.
-lsn't that the homeless shelter?

705
00:51:46,694 --> 00:51:48,321
-l'm going into an apartment.
-Yeah.

706
00:51:48,496 --> 00:51:50,964
-l had no idea.
-Yeah.

707
00:51:51,132 --> 00:51:52,861
Come on.

708
00:51:59,307 --> 00:52:00,865
Like that.

709
00:52:01,342 --> 00:52:05,108
-l'm not sure about this.
-Come on, Chrissa. Cut.

710
00:52:06,281 --> 00:52:11,344
-l've never cut anyone's hair before.
-Chrissa, l know you can do it.

711
00:52:11,519 --> 00:52:12,952
l really want bangs.

712
00:52:14,022 --> 00:52:15,216
Okay.

713
00:52:15,390 --> 00:52:19,793
You're doing that all wrong, Chrissa.
l could cut your hair for you, Gwen.

714
00:52:19,961 --> 00:52:21,656
l don't think so.

715
00:52:21,829 --> 00:52:23,228
-Oh, come on, Gwen.
-Come on.

716
00:52:23,398 --> 00:52:25,593
Tara's mom is a hairdresser.

717
00:52:25,767 --> 00:52:28,361
She's seen a million people
get their hair cut.

718
00:52:28,536 --> 00:52:30,527
-Yeah.
-She is really good.

719
00:52:31,773 --> 00:52:33,741
l think you'd look really pretty.

720
00:52:33,908 --> 00:52:37,605
Your bangs should come right about
where your eyebrows are.

721
00:52:37,779 --> 00:52:41,044
Come on, please. You'd look adorable.

722
00:52:41,215 --> 00:52:43,547
Precious. Please.

723
00:52:44,519 --> 00:52:47,454
-Okay.
-Okay, face me.

724
00:52:50,291 --> 00:52:53,852
This is how you cut bangs.
My mom showed me.

725
00:53:01,102 --> 00:53:02,899
Do you like it?

726
00:53:04,138 --> 00:53:06,504
Yes. l love it.

727
00:53:07,675 --> 00:53:10,803
-You look great, Gwen.
-Come on.

728
00:53:20,154 --> 00:53:21,519
l made a little mistake.

729
00:53:22,523 --> 00:53:26,516
Now you really look
like a homeless person.

730
00:53:27,095 --> 00:53:28,926
Come on, girls.

731
00:53:29,097 --> 00:53:30,826
Sonali.

732
00:53:30,999 --> 00:53:32,694
Sonali.

733
00:53:39,807 --> 00:53:41,331
Gwen.

734
00:53:44,779 --> 00:53:46,610
How could you?

735
00:53:50,551 --> 00:53:52,644
Gwen. Gwen, l--

736
00:53:52,820 --> 00:53:54,947
lf you girls thought
that this was a joke...

737
00:53:55,123 --> 00:53:58,115
...l can assure you that
Gwen Thompson didn't think it was funny.

738
00:53:59,160 --> 00:54:01,651
l wanna hear what happened
in that bathroom.

739
00:54:03,331 --> 00:54:06,357
Well, we were trying to help her.

740
00:54:07,969 --> 00:54:09,402
After all, she is homeless.

741
00:54:09,570 --> 00:54:11,697
And how do you know
that she's homeless?

742
00:54:11,873 --> 00:54:13,636
That's a private piece of information.

743
00:54:15,710 --> 00:54:16,802
Chrissa told me.

744
00:54:16,978 --> 00:54:20,539
-No, l didn't.
-Chrissa.

745
00:54:20,715 --> 00:54:23,980
Gwen told me she confided in you,
and that she didn't tell anyone else.

746
00:54:24,152 --> 00:54:27,087
And neither did l. Honest, l promise.

747
00:54:31,125 --> 00:54:32,888
Jayden?

748
00:54:33,061 --> 00:54:34,585
What happened?

749
00:54:35,363 --> 00:54:36,557
l didn't see anything.

750
00:54:38,132 --> 00:54:39,759
Now, l find that hard to believe.

751
00:54:43,004 --> 00:54:44,096
Sonali?

752
00:54:45,506 --> 00:54:47,701
Sonali?

753
00:54:51,612 --> 00:54:53,978
Tara started to cut Gwen's hair...

754
00:54:54,148 --> 00:54:56,082
...and there was an accident.

755
00:54:57,652 --> 00:55:00,120
lt's very hard for someone
in Gwen's circumstances...

756
00:55:00,288 --> 00:55:01,949
...to come to school every day.

757
00:55:02,523 --> 00:55:04,514
She's now been devastated.

758
00:55:04,692 --> 00:55:07,388
She's afraid to come back to school.

759
00:55:14,802 --> 00:55:18,033
lt wasn't Chrissa who told Tara
about Gwen being homeless.

760
00:55:18,473 --> 00:55:20,031
At least not on purpose.

761
00:55:20,975 --> 00:55:24,035
We overheard them talking
in the music room.

762
00:55:24,645 --> 00:55:26,272
That's how Tara knew.

763
00:55:29,250 --> 00:55:32,583
An incident like this is never going
to happen at this school again.

764
00:55:32,753 --> 00:55:36,587
Tara, l am going to suspend you
three days.

765
00:55:36,757 --> 00:55:40,625
And while you're at home, l want you
to think about what Gwen is feeling.

766
00:55:40,795 --> 00:55:43,263
How would you feel
if the same thing happened to you?

767
00:55:43,431 --> 00:55:45,160
l will, Mrs. Ziminsky.

768
00:55:45,333 --> 00:55:48,427
This is not the first time
that you girls have ganged up on her.

769
00:55:48,603 --> 00:55:53,336
So Jayden and Sonali,
you're suspended for a day.

770
00:55:54,142 --> 00:55:55,473
Will this go on my record?

771
00:55:56,944 --> 00:55:59,174
Sonali, l wanna thank you.

772
00:56:00,081 --> 00:56:03,642
lt's hard telling the truth.
lt's not always an easy thing to do.

773
00:56:05,253 --> 00:56:07,084
And, Chrissa...

774
00:56:07,255 --> 00:56:10,349
...l'm glad that Gwen has a friend
like you.

775
00:56:12,226 --> 00:56:13,921
Well, girls...

776
00:56:14,829 --> 00:56:16,626
...let's call your parents.

777
00:56:16,797 --> 00:56:18,355
Tara.

778
00:56:22,336 --> 00:56:24,531
That must have been so hard on you,
sweetie.

779
00:56:24,705 --> 00:56:26,935
Watching those girls do that
to your friends.

780
00:56:27,108 --> 00:56:29,303
l can't believe
they would call Gwen homeless...

781
00:56:29,477 --> 00:56:31,843
...unless they really wanted
to hurt her feelings.

782
00:56:32,013 --> 00:56:35,073
-Well, they did wanna hurt her feelings.
-Those girls are bullies.

783
00:56:35,249 --> 00:56:37,012
When l was a girl,
there was a saying:

784
00:56:37,185 --> 00:56:39,085
''Sticks and stones
may break your bones...

785
00:56:39,253 --> 00:56:40,720
...but words can never hurt me.''

786
00:56:41,122 --> 00:56:43,022
-l've heard of that.
-Well, it's not true.

787
00:56:43,191 --> 00:56:46,024
Words can hurt.
They can do a lot of damage.

788
00:56:46,194 --> 00:56:48,458
Once they're out there,
you can't take them back.

789
00:56:49,163 --> 00:56:50,721
l know.

790
00:56:50,898 --> 00:56:52,388
Just write that down.

791
00:56:52,567 --> 00:56:56,230
Do you guys got that?
The three branches of government.

792
00:57:08,516 --> 00:57:10,916
<i>She's now been devastated,</i>

793
00:57:11,852 --> 00:57:14,719
<i>She's afraid to come back to school,</i>

794
00:57:19,160 --> 00:57:20,184
<i>Sunrise House,</i>

795
00:57:20,361 --> 00:57:22,556
Hello? ls Gwen Thomson there, please?

796
00:57:23,464 --> 00:57:25,659
<i>She's not here anymore,</i>

797
00:57:27,001 --> 00:57:30,698
-She moved already?
-<i>Yes, Yes, she did,</i>

798
00:57:30,871 --> 00:57:33,203
Well, do you think l can have
her new number?

799
00:57:33,374 --> 00:57:36,241
<i>No, I'm sorry,</i>
<i>I can't give that information,</i>

800
00:57:36,410 --> 00:57:39,038
-Okay.
-<i>Is there anything else I can do for you?</i>

801
00:57:39,213 --> 00:57:41,272
Okay. Thanks anyway.

802
00:57:41,449 --> 00:57:43,644
-<i>All right,</i>
-Bye.

803
00:57:50,124 --> 00:57:51,887
Did you see that shirt at the store?

804
00:57:52,059 --> 00:57:53,583
Yeah, l saw it and l liked it.

805
00:57:53,761 --> 00:57:57,561
-l need to talk to you.
-l don't wanna talk to you.

806
00:57:57,732 --> 00:58:00,633
-Gwen, Chrissa didn't tell--
-Sonali, let's go.

807
00:58:00,801 --> 00:58:01,961
Wait a second.

808
00:58:02,570 --> 00:58:05,630
Gwen, Chrissa didn't tell Tara
your secret.

809
00:58:05,806 --> 00:58:07,865
We heard you guys talking
in the music room.

810
00:58:08,042 --> 00:58:09,566
That's how Tara knew.

811
00:58:09,744 --> 00:58:14,579
And, Gwen, l'm really sorry
about how mean l've been to you.

812
00:58:14,749 --> 00:58:16,774
You know, Tara's gonna be really mad.

813
00:58:17,585 --> 00:58:18,609
Yeah.

814
00:58:18,786 --> 00:58:21,414
You know what, Jayden?
l don't care.

815
00:58:32,533 --> 00:58:34,057
This is, like, so out there.

816
00:58:34,235 --> 00:58:37,466
This is, like, everywhere.

817
00:58:37,972 --> 00:58:39,530
l'm done.

818
00:58:43,077 --> 00:58:45,136
l kind of like this.

819
00:58:45,313 --> 00:58:47,747
Our scarves are gonna look so cool.

820
00:58:57,425 --> 00:58:58,983
lt's nothing.

821
00:59:03,898 --> 00:59:08,392
l have been thinking about these girls
all weekend.

822
00:59:08,903 --> 00:59:10,564
l don't know what we're gonna do.

823
00:59:10,738 --> 00:59:12,467
Well, it's becoming a problem.

824
00:59:13,240 --> 00:59:17,301
Tara's always been a little high-strung,
but she's always been a good student.

825
00:59:17,845 --> 00:59:20,040
What about Chrissa? What is she like?

826
00:59:21,982 --> 00:59:25,611
She's quiet, finishes all her work.

827
00:59:25,786 --> 00:59:28,880
-Chrissa is a good kid.
-Okay.

828
00:59:29,056 --> 00:59:31,456
But we're gonna have to do something.

829
00:59:32,026 --> 00:59:33,220
You're right.

830
00:59:33,394 --> 00:59:34,986
You are right, and l have an idea.

831
00:59:37,665 --> 00:59:39,428
-l'll see you at lunch, Gwen.
-Bye.

832
00:59:39,600 --> 00:59:41,090
Bye.

833
00:59:42,169 --> 00:59:43,898
What is that thing on your head?

834
00:59:44,638 --> 00:59:48,199
-Yeah, are you trying to look stupid?
-Take it off or you're out of our club.

835
00:59:52,947 --> 00:59:55,711
l'm not taking it off. l like it.

836
00:59:57,718 --> 00:59:59,515
Whatever.

837
00:59:59,687 --> 01:00:02,155
Tara, Jayden, don't get too comfortable.

838
01:00:02,323 --> 01:00:05,986
-Jayden, l'm moving you to Cluster 3.
-What? This isn't fair.

839
01:00:06,160 --> 01:00:08,685
Tara, you switch with Brock.

840
01:00:08,863 --> 01:00:10,831
But l can't see way back there.

841
01:00:10,998 --> 01:00:13,057
We'll send a note
to get your vision checked.

842
01:00:13,234 --> 01:00:15,395
ln the meantime,
take a seat in Cluster 1 .

843
01:00:16,937 --> 01:00:20,134
And, Gwen,
l'm moving you to Cluster 4.

844
01:00:28,549 --> 01:00:30,346
Gwen, come on.

845
01:00:35,723 --> 01:00:37,088
No. Do you have it?

846
01:00:37,258 --> 01:00:39,419
l got a new hairbrush.

847
01:00:40,361 --> 01:00:42,329
-That's so funny.
-That's funny.

848
01:00:42,496 --> 01:00:45,363
-Hi, Chrissa.
-Hi.

849
01:00:52,406 --> 01:00:54,135
-Stop. lt's not funny.
-Stop laughing.

850
01:00:54,308 --> 01:00:57,334
Stop it. lt's not funny. Stop it.

851
01:00:57,511 --> 01:00:58,773
Stop.

852
01:00:58,946 --> 01:01:00,914
-Guys, that's really mean.
-lt's not funny.

853
01:01:01,081 --> 01:01:02,639
Stop it.

854
01:01:06,921 --> 01:01:09,412
Gee, Chrissa, l guess nobody likes you.

855
01:01:10,724 --> 01:01:13,557
-Guess not.
-Tara, you have to cut this out.

856
01:01:13,727 --> 01:01:16,195
What? We didn't do anything, did we?

857
01:01:16,363 --> 01:01:18,763
-No, we didn't.
-No.

858
01:01:19,333 --> 01:01:21,995
-Just stop it, okay?
-Or what?

859
01:01:23,304 --> 01:01:25,033
Or what?

860
01:01:38,586 --> 01:01:40,019
Just stop it.

861
01:01:40,788 --> 01:01:42,346
We're shaking. Shaking.

862
01:01:42,523 --> 01:01:44,218
-Yeah, we're shaking.
-Shaking.

863
01:01:44,391 --> 01:01:46,586
We're so scared.

864
01:01:46,861 --> 01:01:49,159
-Bye, Chrissa.
-Bye, Chrissa.

865
01:01:51,765 --> 01:01:53,460
l don't know.

866
01:01:54,068 --> 01:01:57,333
-Are you okay?
-No.

867
01:01:58,806 --> 01:02:00,831
My stomach hurts.

868
01:02:05,579 --> 01:02:06,978
-Well, hello, ladies.
-Hi.

869
01:02:07,147 --> 01:02:08,341
-Come on in.
-Hi.

870
01:02:08,516 --> 01:02:10,609
-Okay.
-She's in there.

871
01:02:10,784 --> 01:02:12,581
-Thanks.
-Thanks.

872
01:02:12,753 --> 01:02:14,812
-Hey, guys.
-Hey.

873
01:02:14,989 --> 01:02:16,013
Hi.

874
01:02:16,190 --> 01:02:17,782
Are you okay?

875
01:02:17,958 --> 01:02:19,425
Yeah.

876
01:02:19,860 --> 01:02:21,919
Were there any signs hanging around
today?

877
01:02:22,096 --> 01:02:23,893
No. Was that why you stayed home?

878
01:02:24,832 --> 01:02:27,232
l just couldn't stand going back there
again.

879
01:02:27,401 --> 01:02:30,859
l mean,
l'm really considering homeschooling.

880
01:02:34,375 --> 01:02:37,310
Chrissa, l know how hard it can be
to go to school some days...

881
01:02:37,478 --> 01:02:39,673
...but if there's one thing l've learned...

882
01:02:39,847 --> 01:02:43,681
...staying home means you lose
and they win.

883
01:02:43,851 --> 01:02:46,479
l mean, you're gonna get behind
in school...

884
01:02:46,654 --> 01:02:50,055
...and then you'll have two problems:
Tara and bad grades.

885
01:02:50,858 --> 01:02:53,258
Besides, we're stronger than they are.

886
01:02:53,427 --> 01:02:54,553
Yeah.

887
01:02:54,728 --> 01:02:56,696
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

888
01:02:59,433 --> 01:03:02,994
Today we learned
about diagramming sentences.

889
01:03:03,170 --> 01:03:05,001
Here.

890
01:03:06,807 --> 01:03:10,834
-What page is it?
-l think 21 . Here, let me check it.

891
01:03:11,011 --> 01:03:13,138
l'm a little off-- Oh, here it is.

892
01:03:13,314 --> 01:03:14,440
Okay. Okay.

893
01:03:46,113 --> 01:03:50,516
Guys, teammates don't do this
to one another.

894
01:03:50,684 --> 01:03:52,584
Now, l'm gonna ask one last time.

895
01:03:54,188 --> 01:03:56,315
Who posted that message?

896
01:04:02,429 --> 01:04:04,397
lt wasn't me.

897
01:04:07,167 --> 01:04:11,604
Okay, from now on, nothing gets posted
until l see it first.

898
01:04:11,772 --> 01:04:14,798
And since no one's willing
to come forward...

899
01:04:15,809 --> 01:04:18,209
...l have no choice
but to punish all of you.

900
01:04:18,379 --> 01:04:21,007
We're gonna knock off practice today
a half-hour early...

901
01:04:21,181 --> 01:04:24,446
...and we are going to clean this facility
until it shines.

902
01:04:25,753 --> 01:04:30,087
And if l ever, ever see anything
like that again...

903
01:04:30,257 --> 01:04:34,626
...l promise you l will cancel
the rest of this season.

904
01:04:36,964 --> 01:04:38,591
Yes, Tara.

905
01:04:38,766 --> 01:04:40,825
-ls it true?
-ls what true?

906
01:04:41,602 --> 01:04:43,399
About the skin disease...

907
01:04:43,570 --> 01:04:47,631
...because if it is,
l can't be swimming in that water.

908
01:04:47,808 --> 01:04:51,107
You know what, Tara? You sit out today.

909
01:04:51,578 --> 01:04:53,773
Let's go, young lady.

910
01:04:55,516 --> 01:04:56,676
Oh, man.

911
01:04:57,551 --> 01:05:01,146
Let's get to work. Group 1 , diving.
Group 2, conditioning.

912
01:05:01,321 --> 01:05:05,519
Group 3, kick practice. Let's go.
Move it. Come on.

913
01:05:05,693 --> 01:05:07,718
Hold the board tighter.

914
01:05:08,929 --> 01:05:10,920
Forward.

915
01:05:11,098 --> 01:05:12,827
All the boards are gone.

916
01:05:15,302 --> 01:05:17,827
Look at this. You do great in practice...

917
01:05:18,005 --> 01:05:20,473
...and then in competition, you freeze up.
What's up?

918
01:05:21,608 --> 01:05:23,667
-You get nervous?
-Five more minutes.

919
01:05:23,844 --> 01:05:26,369
Look, you just gotta pretend
there's nobody else there.

920
01:05:26,914 --> 01:05:30,042
lt's just you and the water.
You gotta block everything else out.

921
01:05:30,217 --> 01:05:31,275
All right?

922
01:05:31,452 --> 01:05:33,682
-Okay.
-Let's go, Kelly.

923
01:05:37,925 --> 01:05:40,519
-Nice, Tyler. Keep it up.
-Thanks.

924
01:05:40,694 --> 01:05:44,391
-Don't forget your bag.
-Okay, guys. Conditioning.

925
01:05:44,565 --> 01:05:46,294
Get your kickboards out.

926
01:05:46,467 --> 01:05:49,595
-Come on, guys.
-Don't look so excited.

927
01:05:51,472 --> 01:05:53,940
All right, nice. Good. Strong.
Strong work.

928
01:05:54,108 --> 01:05:55,575
l can do that dive, Tyler.

929
01:05:55,743 --> 01:05:57,643
-Yeah?
-lt's not so hard.

930
01:05:57,811 --> 01:06:00,006
ln fact, l won a medal for it
in summer camp.

931
01:06:00,180 --> 01:06:01,374
That's good for you, Tara.

932
01:06:01,915 --> 01:06:05,612
Of course, my dive's harder
because l do a corkscrew twist.

933
01:06:05,786 --> 01:06:10,086
-That doesn't sound that hard.
-l learned it from an Olympic champion.

934
01:06:10,257 --> 01:06:13,158
He said l was a natural.
He complimented my form.

935
01:06:13,327 --> 01:06:15,591
Tara, get down.
You're not supposed to be up here.

936
01:06:15,763 --> 01:06:18,891
-What, are you gonna go tattletale on me?
-Tara, leave him alone.

937
01:06:19,066 --> 01:06:20,624
No.

938
01:06:20,801 --> 01:06:23,895
l bet you can't do it, Tyler,
because it's too hard.

939
01:06:24,071 --> 01:06:26,938
-My corkscrew has two twists.
-Tara, come on.

940
01:06:27,107 --> 01:06:28,904
-You won't be able to do it.
-Tara.

941
01:06:29,076 --> 01:06:31,874
-You're not going to be able to do it.
-Tara, get down.

942
01:06:32,045 --> 01:06:33,069
No.

943
01:06:33,247 --> 01:06:36,114
-You're not gonna be able to do it.
-Stop it.

944
01:06:36,283 --> 01:06:37,750
-You won't do it, chicken.
-Tara.

945
01:06:37,918 --> 01:06:40,216
l'm the only one that can do it.

946
01:06:40,387 --> 01:06:43,447
-Tara, he won't do it. Just come on, Tara.
-Twist.

947
01:06:46,760 --> 01:06:48,125
Tyler!

948
01:06:48,295 --> 01:06:49,489
Tyler!

949
01:06:50,597 --> 01:06:52,064
Tyler!

950
01:07:02,576 --> 01:07:04,942
Tyler. Oh, my gosh.

951
01:07:05,112 --> 01:07:08,013
Honey, don't cry. He's gonna be all right.

952
01:07:08,182 --> 01:07:10,207
You don't know that.

953
01:07:10,818 --> 01:07:12,877
This is all my fault.

954
01:07:13,053 --> 01:07:15,988
Oh, really?
Did you push him off the board?

955
01:07:16,156 --> 01:07:19,182
No, but l didn't do anything.

956
01:07:19,359 --> 01:07:23,386
l mean, all l kept on thinking was,
''l've gotta go get Mr. Beck.''

957
01:07:23,564 --> 01:07:25,429
And l didn't.

958
01:07:25,833 --> 01:07:27,858
lt all happened so fast.

959
01:07:28,035 --> 01:07:30,629
Honey, it's a really horrible thing
that happened...

960
01:07:30,804 --> 01:07:34,467
...but it is absolutely not your fault.

961
01:07:35,275 --> 01:07:38,142
Hey. Hey. Tyler's gonna be okay.

962
01:07:38,612 --> 01:07:41,513
lt isn't a concussion,
but they're gonna keep him overnight.

963
01:07:41,682 --> 01:07:44,583
-Well, can l go see him?
-He's sleeping right now, sweetie.

964
01:07:44,751 --> 01:07:47,276
No, l think you should go home.

965
01:07:48,255 --> 01:07:50,883
-He'll be home tomorrow, okay?
-Come on.

966
01:07:51,058 --> 01:07:53,288
Come on, honey. lt's gonna be okay.

967
01:07:57,264 --> 01:08:00,597
l was only fooling around.
l didn't mean for anyone to get hurt.

968
01:08:00,767 --> 01:08:01,825
Save it, Tara.

969
01:08:02,369 --> 01:08:06,169
Neither one of you had any business
being up on that ladder.

970
01:08:06,340 --> 01:08:08,308
Do you see why the rules are in place?

971
01:08:08,475 --> 01:08:10,636
We just talked about horsing around,
remember?

972
01:08:10,811 --> 01:08:14,076
Yes. l'm really upset.

973
01:08:15,182 --> 01:08:17,150
l'm so sorry.

974
01:08:18,118 --> 01:08:19,415
What am l gonna do with you?

975
01:08:19,586 --> 01:08:23,818
l gotta separate you in class,
and l gotta separate you in swimming too?

976
01:08:23,991 --> 01:08:28,360
Tara, you're on towel duty
for the rest of the season.

977
01:08:28,528 --> 01:08:30,393
-Do l still get to swim?
-Yes.

978
01:08:30,564 --> 01:08:32,464
After each and every meet and practice...

979
01:08:32,633 --> 01:08:36,592
...you'll be responsible
for all the wet and dirty towels.

980
01:08:36,770 --> 01:08:38,203
What about her?

981
01:08:39,673 --> 01:08:41,573
-Chrissa.
-lt's okay.

982
01:08:41,742 --> 01:08:43,334
l decided l'm gonna quit the team.

983
01:08:44,144 --> 01:08:46,044
Chrissa, that isn't necessary.

984
01:08:46,213 --> 01:08:49,080
Now, Chrissa, l know you're upset
about your brother...

985
01:08:49,249 --> 01:08:52,343
...but there have to be consequences
when you break the rules.

986
01:08:52,519 --> 01:08:54,680
l'm not quitting
just to get out of punishment.

987
01:08:56,857 --> 01:08:58,347
Okay, then, why?

988
01:09:07,467 --> 01:09:09,230
Okay, Chrissa.

989
01:09:09,403 --> 01:09:12,964
You're gonna be cleaning up the classroom
for the next two weeks.

990
01:09:20,981 --> 01:09:22,608
Bring it on. Bring it on.

991
01:09:22,783 --> 01:09:24,944
Yeah, you don't want me to bring it on.

992
01:09:25,118 --> 01:09:26,312
Tyler.

993
01:09:26,486 --> 01:09:28,954
-We have something for you.
-Yes, we do.

994
01:09:29,523 --> 01:09:31,457
What? A pound of chocolate Raisinets?

995
01:09:31,625 --> 01:09:33,525
-No.
-No.

996
01:09:33,694 --> 01:09:36,925
-A new Game Boy?
-No.

997
01:09:37,097 --> 01:09:38,724
Then what?

998
01:09:40,467 --> 01:09:45,029
-A solidarity scarf, silly.
-Sweet.

999
01:09:46,640 --> 01:09:49,131
No way am l wearing this.

1000
01:09:50,644 --> 01:09:51,838
Dig it.

1001
01:09:52,779 --> 01:09:55,145
Lemonade and cookies in the kitchen.

1002
01:09:55,615 --> 01:09:57,344
-l'm totally there.
-Do you want some?

1003
01:09:57,517 --> 01:09:59,109
Sure, but wait.

1004
01:10:02,356 --> 01:10:04,256
l heard you quit the swim team.

1005
01:10:04,424 --> 01:10:06,449
-Well, yeah. l had to.
-Why?

1006
01:10:06,626 --> 01:10:08,719
Because you're out
for the rest of the season.

1007
01:10:08,895 --> 01:10:11,591
-So l'm gonna stay out too.
-Well, that's stupid.

1008
01:10:12,532 --> 01:10:16,764
Tyler, l'm really, really sorry
this happened to you.

1009
01:10:16,937 --> 01:10:19,269
Me too. l'm never listening to Tara again.

1010
01:10:20,507 --> 01:10:21,804
This is all my fault.

1011
01:10:21,975 --> 01:10:25,308
Chrissa, it isn't about you.
l should have never listened to her.

1012
01:10:25,479 --> 01:10:30,507
No. No, if Tara didn't hate me so much,
she would have never done this to you.

1013
01:10:30,684 --> 01:10:33,414
-l don't wanna be around her anymore.
-So you're a quitter?

1014
01:10:34,521 --> 01:10:36,352
l guess so.

1015
01:10:56,710 --> 01:10:59,873
The Tigers will be inspired to win
after they see this poster.

1016
01:11:00,047 --> 01:11:01,947
l hope so.

1017
01:11:02,649 --> 01:11:04,241
So...

1018
01:11:05,352 --> 01:11:07,343
...l hear you quit the swim team.

1019
01:11:09,089 --> 01:11:11,523
Yeah, l decided
l don't really like swimming.

1020
01:11:11,691 --> 01:11:12,988
Really?

1021
01:11:13,160 --> 01:11:15,720
And if Tyler can't swim....

1022
01:11:15,896 --> 01:11:19,195
l don't think this has anything to do
with Tyler.

1023
01:11:19,366 --> 01:11:23,234
l do, however, think
this has something to do with Tara.

1024
01:11:27,207 --> 01:11:28,868
You know...

1025
01:11:30,143 --> 01:11:32,111
...l always felt sorry for Tara.

1026
01:11:33,213 --> 01:11:34,237
Why?

1027
01:11:34,414 --> 01:11:37,349
Well, because when someone
is determined...

1028
01:11:37,517 --> 01:11:40,384
...to make other people
feel bad about themselves...

1029
01:11:40,554 --> 01:11:43,614
...it's usually so they can feel good
about themselves.

1030
01:11:44,925 --> 01:11:47,359
How can making someone feel bad
make you feel good?

1031
01:11:47,928 --> 01:11:51,523
Because in order to feel
like you're worth something...

1032
01:11:51,698 --> 01:11:55,600
...you need other people
to feel less than their best.

1033
01:11:55,769 --> 01:12:00,433
lt sounds to me
like that's what Tara's done to you.

1034
01:12:04,311 --> 01:12:06,609
She doesn't act like she feels bad
about herself.

1035
01:12:06,780 --> 01:12:10,511
Saying mean things.
Hurting other people.

1036
01:12:10,684 --> 01:12:12,845
Cutting you down.

1037
01:12:13,854 --> 01:12:15,617
She must be very insecure.

1038
01:12:18,925 --> 01:12:22,452
lf you could wave a magic wand
and change something...

1039
01:12:22,629 --> 01:12:24,756
...what would you do?

1040
01:12:27,267 --> 01:12:29,132
<i>You won't be able to do it, chicken,</i>

1041
01:12:29,302 --> 01:12:31,429
<i>Tara, get down,</i>

1042
01:12:33,106 --> 01:12:35,074
l would take back Tyler's accident...

1043
01:12:35,242 --> 01:12:37,904
...and make it so that no one's ever mean
to anyone again.

1044
01:12:38,078 --> 01:12:43,141
That would be lovely, wouldn't it?
But it's not very realistic.

1045
01:12:44,184 --> 01:12:47,517
l find that sometimes
when kids have a big problem...

1046
01:12:47,687 --> 01:12:50,952
...they try to solve it themselves...

1047
01:12:51,625 --> 01:12:56,358
...but sometimes problems
are too big and complicated...

1048
01:12:56,530 --> 01:12:59,465
...for kids to solve on their own.

1049
01:12:59,933 --> 01:13:03,699
They need help and they need to know
that it's okay to ask for help.

1050
01:13:03,870 --> 01:13:07,203
Grownups say that,
but what if it doesn't work?

1051
01:13:07,374 --> 01:13:11,435
We're the ones who have to go to school
with the mean kids who just get meaner.

1052
01:13:12,379 --> 01:13:14,347
l see your point...

1053
01:13:14,514 --> 01:13:16,175
...but l think you'd be surprised...

1054
01:13:16,349 --> 01:13:18,681
...at how turning to an adult you trust
can help.

1055
01:13:19,553 --> 01:13:26,049
Sometimes they can help in a way
where it's not really obvious.

1056
01:13:26,526 --> 01:13:29,495
Don't you have an adult you can turn to
when you have a problem?

1057
01:13:31,932 --> 01:13:34,196
My mom says l can tell her and my dad
anything.

1058
01:13:34,734 --> 01:13:36,964
That would be a very good place to start.

1059
01:13:43,210 --> 01:13:44,871
Thanks.

1060
01:13:52,586 --> 01:13:55,214
Don't spoil your appetite.
Oh, hey, Chrissa.

1061
01:13:55,956 --> 01:13:59,119
Chicken Fricassee's on the menu.
With paprika? Without?

1062
01:13:59,292 --> 01:14:00,384
-With.
-With.

1063
01:14:00,560 --> 01:14:01,686
-Mom.
-Hand me that.

1064
01:14:01,861 --> 01:14:03,556
-Dad?
-Yeah.

1065
01:14:05,699 --> 01:14:08,031
Moving out here has been really hard.

1066
01:14:08,201 --> 01:14:09,998
Because you miss your friends?

1067
01:14:10,170 --> 01:14:14,766
Not just because of that,
but because of this.

1068
01:14:18,345 --> 01:14:19,539
Oh, Chrissa.

1069
01:14:22,082 --> 01:14:24,346
May l see that? Let me see.

1070
01:14:26,886 --> 01:14:28,376
Do you know who did this?

1071
01:14:28,555 --> 01:14:31,888
-l'm betting it was Tara.
-Swim-team Tara?

1072
01:14:32,492 --> 01:14:33,516
Yeah.

1073
01:14:33,693 --> 01:14:36,253
lt's because of her
that she quit the team.

1074
01:14:36,429 --> 01:14:38,056
Chrissa, you quit the swim team?

1075
01:14:38,231 --> 01:14:41,564
Honey, l'm so sorry.
That Tara is bad news.

1076
01:14:42,168 --> 01:14:44,363
l knew something was going on.

1077
01:14:45,872 --> 01:14:48,739
lt's just so hard.
l've been trying to make it work.

1078
01:14:48,908 --> 01:14:50,398
Oh, sweetheart, for how long?

1079
01:14:51,945 --> 01:14:53,435
Since the first day of school.

1080
01:14:53,613 --> 01:14:55,911
So Gwen wasn't the only one
being bullied?

1081
01:14:56,883 --> 01:14:59,317
Oh, honey, l wish you'd come to us.

1082
01:14:59,486 --> 01:15:01,886
l don't wanna be called a tattletale.

1083
01:15:02,055 --> 01:15:05,582
Tattling's different.
lt's kind of like getting even with someone.

1084
01:15:05,759 --> 01:15:07,750
Speaking up is protecting yourself.

1085
01:15:07,927 --> 01:15:10,157
l'm so sorry this has been going on.

1086
01:15:10,330 --> 01:15:14,198
Believe me, it stops now.
l'm gonna call the principal and Mr. Beck.

1087
01:15:14,367 --> 01:15:16,335
We're gonna set up a meeting
and tell them.

1088
01:15:16,503 --> 01:15:18,903
No, that's just gonna make it worse.

1089
01:15:19,072 --> 01:15:21,438
Sweetie, that's how bullies work.

1090
01:15:21,608 --> 01:15:24,099
They depend on kids being
too afraid to speak up.

1091
01:15:24,277 --> 01:15:27,144
That's how the bullying keeps going.

1092
01:15:28,481 --> 01:15:31,348
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

1093
01:15:31,651 --> 01:15:35,644
-Are you sure, Mom?
-l'm positive, baby.

1094
01:15:35,822 --> 01:15:37,289
Okay.

1095
01:15:37,991 --> 01:15:39,788
Oh, hey.

1096
01:15:39,959 --> 01:15:44,123
Are you still working on ideas for
that big fourth-grade social studies project?

1097
01:15:44,631 --> 01:15:45,757
Yeah.

1098
01:15:47,067 --> 01:15:49,262
Maybe there's something
we could do about that.

1099
01:15:50,203 --> 01:15:52,171
Okay, class, let's open our English books.

1100
01:15:52,339 --> 01:15:54,364
-Mr. Beck?
-To page 50.

1101
01:15:54,541 --> 01:15:56,304
-Mr. Beck.
-Yes, Chrissa?

1102
01:15:57,944 --> 01:15:59,775
l have an idea for our project.

1103
01:16:00,146 --> 01:16:01,704
Well, l love your enthusiasm...

1104
01:16:01,881 --> 01:16:03,781
...but we're talking about that
next week.

1105
01:16:03,950 --> 01:16:05,815
-But l have an idea today.
-What?

1106
01:16:05,985 --> 01:16:08,317
-Have a llama-bean omelet this morning?
-Tara.

1107
01:16:11,524 --> 01:16:12,718
Okay, Chrissa, what is it?

1108
01:16:12,892 --> 01:16:15,360
Let's do our project
about school bullying.

1109
01:16:16,663 --> 01:16:18,790
l think that's a great idea.

1110
01:16:19,165 --> 01:16:21,065
How many of you have felt bullied?

1111
01:16:28,942 --> 01:16:31,376
l wanna do this
because this happened to me.

1112
01:16:31,544 --> 01:16:33,842
And l didn't know how to make it stop.

1113
01:16:34,013 --> 01:16:36,743
And then l didn't even
wanna go to school.

1114
01:16:52,699 --> 01:16:55,497
Okay. Looks like we have a project.

1115
01:17:09,082 --> 01:17:10,777
So?

1116
01:17:10,950 --> 01:17:13,350
You don't have to ask. School was great.

1117
01:17:13,520 --> 01:17:15,044
They loved my idea.

1118
01:17:15,221 --> 01:17:17,849
You know what?
Lots of kids have been bullied.

1119
01:17:18,024 --> 01:17:20,458
Did Tara or Jayden
do anything bad today?

1120
01:17:20,994 --> 01:17:22,825
No.

1121
01:17:22,996 --> 01:17:25,863
See? l knew you
were gonna have a good day.

1122
01:17:30,670 --> 01:17:32,934
So tomorrow's the big swim meet,
isn't it?

1123
01:17:34,007 --> 01:17:36,100
Yeah, l guess it is.

1124
01:17:37,477 --> 01:17:38,876
l decided l'm not gonna go.

1125
01:17:41,314 --> 01:17:43,908
Did l ever tell you
how the kids were mean to me?

1126
01:17:44,083 --> 01:17:45,573
You, Mom?

1127
01:17:45,752 --> 01:17:47,583
Yup.

1128
01:17:47,754 --> 01:17:53,590
l was getting the highest grades in the class
and the kids were calling me names...

1129
01:17:53,760 --> 01:17:57,628
...like ''egghead'' and ''brainiac''
and ''bookworm.''

1130
01:17:57,797 --> 01:17:59,162
''Miss Square.''

1131
01:18:00,366 --> 01:18:04,393
So to make it stop,
l started failing instead of succeeding.

1132
01:18:04,971 --> 01:18:07,303
And then l realized how stupid that was.

1133
01:18:07,474 --> 01:18:09,101
Why?

1134
01:18:09,909 --> 01:18:12,969
Sweetie, it's never smart
to be less than who you are.

1135
01:18:13,413 --> 01:18:16,780
Or to let anyone
take anything away from you.

1136
01:18:18,284 --> 01:18:19,945
Thanks, Mom.

1137
01:18:23,156 --> 01:18:24,418
Jimmy.

1138
01:18:24,591 --> 01:18:26,218
Wait up.

1139
01:18:31,264 --> 01:18:33,562
-Chrissa.
-Hey.

1140
01:18:33,733 --> 01:18:36,167
Well, looks like
our team's complete, guys.

1141
01:18:36,803 --> 01:18:38,771
Welcome back, Chrissa.

1142
01:18:40,473 --> 01:18:42,338
Go, Chrissa.

1143
01:18:42,509 --> 01:18:45,945
-Good to have you back, sweetie.
-Come on, get out here, we're warming up.

1144
01:18:48,715 --> 01:18:50,876
Now we have a team.

1145
01:18:51,050 --> 01:18:52,312

1149
01:19:08,034 --> 01:19:10,332
-Come on, Chrissa.
-Okay, Chrissa, let's go!

1150
01:19:11,404 --> 01:19:12,564
Do it, sweetie.

1151
01:19:19,746 --> 01:19:21,145
Go, go, go!

1152
01:19:25,218 --> 01:19:26,242

Come on, let's go, let's go, let's go!

1156
01:19:46,573 --> 01:19:49,007

1157
01:19:50,310 --> 01:19:52,972

What?

1169
01:20:47,767 --> 01:20:51,533
We may never be best friends,
we may never be any kind of friends...

1170

01:21:25,405 --> 01:21:27,168
Chrissa should swim anchor.

1181
01:21:27,340 --> 01:21:29,103
But l've never swam anchor before.

1182
01:21:29,275 --> 01:21:30,640
Are you kidding me?

1183
01:21:30,810 --> 01:21:33,506
You're the strongest swimmer.
You're like a human fish.

1184
01:21:33,846 --> 01:21:35,143
-But l don't know--
-Come on.

1185
01:21:35,314 --> 01:21:38,545
Do you want this team to win or not?

1186
01:21:39,686 --> 01:21:43,122
Yes. Come on, come on, come on.
Let's go, let's go.

1187
01:21:43,289 --> 01:21:44,483
-Come on, Tara.
-Come on.

1188
01:21:44,657 --> 01:21:46,056
-Come on, Tara.
-Come on, Tara.

1189
01:21:46,225 --> 01:21:47,749
You can do it.

1190
01:21:49,696 --> 01:21:52,460
<i>Swimmers, on your mark,</i>

1191
01:21:55,668 --> 01:21:59,126
-Come on!
-Come on, Tara!

1192
01:21:59,305 --> 01:22:00,397
Go, Tara! Come on.

1193
01:22:01,374 --> 01:22:02,534
Let's go, Tara.

1194
01:22:04,110 --> 01:22:05,338
Tara!

1195
01:22:05,511 --> 01:22:07,138
Go, go, come on!

1196
01:22:07,313 --> 01:22:09,076
Go, Tara.

1197
01:22:09,916 --> 01:22:11,645
-Go, Tara!
-Come on!

1198
01:22:12,385 --> 01:22:15,183
Come on, Tara, go!

1199
01:22:15,354 --> 01:22:18,949
Keep going, keep going!
Come on, Tara! Come on!

1200
01:22:19,125 --> 01:22:20,217
Let's go, Tara!

1201
01:22:28,267 --> 01:22:30,599
Slow down, Tara.

1202
01:22:30,837 --> 01:22:31,929
Let's go!

1203
01:22:34,707 --> 01:22:35,731
Go, Tara, go!

1204
01:22:35,908 --> 01:22:38,240
Come on, come on, come on! Tara, Tara!

1205
01:22:43,449 --> 01:22:45,144
Good job.

1206
01:22:48,321 --> 01:22:49,583
Come on, Alexandra!

1207
01:22:49,856 --> 01:22:52,188
Go, Alexandra!

1208
01:22:57,964 --> 01:23:00,432
Come on! Go, Alexandra!

1209
01:23:05,138 --> 01:23:07,572
-Come on, Alexandra.
-Pull!

1210
01:23:11,444 --> 01:23:13,776
-You can do it!
-Come on! Go, go, go!

1211
01:23:13,946 --> 01:23:15,140
Please, go! Go!

1212
01:23:17,917 --> 01:23:18,975
Come on, come on!

1213
01:23:25,858 --> 01:23:28,588
Let's go, Alexandra, come on.

1214
01:23:29,162 --> 01:23:31,960
Come on, Rachel!
Go, Tigers, come on!

1215
01:23:39,906 --> 01:23:41,806
Come on, Rachel.

1216
01:23:41,974 --> 01:23:43,839
Go! Go, go!

1217
01:23:44,944 --> 01:23:46,002
Yeah, Rachel!

1218
01:23:46,746 --> 01:23:47,770
Good job.

1219
01:23:48,648 --> 01:23:50,138
You can catch her.

1220
01:23:50,316 --> 01:23:51,340
Go, Rachel, go!

1221
01:23:51,517 --> 01:23:53,246
Go!

1222
01:23:53,786 --> 01:23:54,844
Come on, Rachel!

1223
01:23:55,021 --> 01:23:57,581
Go, Tigers! Come on! Come on.

1224
01:23:57,757 --> 01:24:00,351
Okay, don't overreach,
it'll make your back arch.

1225
01:24:00,526 --> 01:24:02,255
Keep your fingers open, not clenched.

1226
01:24:02,428 --> 01:24:05,192
You're going to have to
bend your elbows sooner underwater.

1227
01:24:05,364 --> 01:24:06,831
lf you do that, we're gonna win.

1228
01:24:06,999 --> 01:24:10,435
Come on, Rachel! Go, Tigers! Come on!

1229
01:24:18,978 --> 01:24:20,969
Go, Chrissa!

1230
01:24:24,050 --> 01:24:25,381
Come on, you can do it!

1231
01:24:25,685 --> 01:24:27,550
Go! Go!

1232
01:24:34,026 --> 01:24:35,687
Go, go, go! Come on!

1233
01:24:40,333 --> 01:24:43,234
Chrissa! You can do it!

1234
01:24:44,737 --> 01:24:47,797
You're second! Touch it! Yeah!

1235
01:24:56,215 --> 01:24:59,275
-Come on!
-Come on, Chrissa. Come on.

1236
01:25:22,441 --> 01:25:26,400
l'm very, very proud
of this year's fourth-grade project.

1237
01:25:26,846 --> 01:25:30,441
And it will stand here at the school
as a permanent reminder.

1238
01:25:33,920 --> 01:25:37,617
Here to present our project
is Miss Chrissa Maxwell.

1239
01:25:37,790 --> 01:25:39,758
-Chrissa!
-Hi.

1240
01:25:41,761 --> 01:25:43,353
Go, Chrissa.

1241
01:25:43,529 --> 01:25:45,429
Our project is on school bullying.

1242
01:25:45,598 --> 01:25:48,123
Kids who've been bullied
are afraid to speak out...

1243
01:25:48,301 --> 01:25:50,166
...because the bullying might get worse.

1244
01:25:50,336 --> 01:25:52,827
They think there's nothing
that they can do about it.

1245
01:25:53,005 --> 01:25:56,065
l know this from personal experience.

1246
01:25:56,242 --> 01:26:00,303
But if they stop and speak up,
things can get a lot better.

1247
01:26:01,647 --> 01:26:04,241
Never keep bullying a secret.

1248
01:26:04,750 --> 01:26:08,413
Whether it's about you or a friend.

1249
01:26:09,288 --> 01:26:13,088
This is the friendship arch, and
everyone in the fourth grade chose a word.

1250
01:26:13,259 --> 01:26:15,352
And in the middle
there's the word ''hello'' ...

1251
01:26:15,528 --> 01:26:20,261
...because my grandmother always told me,
'''Hello' is the first word in a friendship.''

1252
01:26:20,566 --> 01:26:22,466
l love you, Nana.

1253
01:26:24,437 --> 01:26:28,771
l chose the word ''courage'' because
it takes courage to stand up to a bully.

1254
01:26:29,508 --> 01:26:32,568
And it takes courage to stop being a bully.

1255
01:26:34,947 --> 01:26:36,744
''Accept'' is my word.

1256
01:26:36,916 --> 01:26:39,009
And l realized that it starts with me.

1257
01:26:39,318 --> 01:26:42,947
No one is better or worse
than anyone else.

1258
01:26:43,122 --> 01:26:46,649
We all have the same problems.
l love you, Mom.

1259
01:26:47,493 --> 01:26:50,087
l chose the word ''forgive.''

1260
01:26:50,262 --> 01:26:52,822
Once you forgive, you can move forward.

1261
01:26:54,533 --> 01:26:56,091
l chose the word ''strength'' ...

1262
01:26:56,268 --> 01:26:58,532
...because no matter
what's going on around you...

1263
01:26:58,704 --> 01:27:00,467
...it's important to be strong inside.

1264
01:27:00,639 --> 01:27:03,665
And to be true to yourself.

1265
01:27:03,943 --> 01:27:05,467
l chose the word ''kind.''

1266
01:27:05,644 --> 01:27:08,135
l chose the words ''no envy.''

1267
01:27:08,848 --> 01:27:10,611
l chose the word ''loyal.''

1268
01:27:27,033 --> 01:27:30,230
Come on, Amanda.
We're taking Starburst for her first swim.
