1
00:00:29,362 --> 00:00:32,297
Woman:
Mostly the job is to ask questions.

2
00:00:32,332 --> 00:00:34,391
The frustrating part,

3
00:00:34,434 --> 00:00:36,902
the part that drives you crazy,

4
00:00:36,936 --> 00:00:40,269
is that the people you really
want to talk to

5
00:00:40,306 --> 00:00:42,035
are dead.

6
00:01:19,245 --> 00:01:22,908
Help me!
Please help me!

7
00:01:22,949 --> 00:01:25,179
Please!
Please!

8
00:01:25,218 --> 00:01:27,118
No, leave me alone.
Please!

9
00:01:27,153 --> 00:01:29,849
Help me!
Help me please!

10
00:01:29,889 --> 00:01:32,255
Help!
Someone help me!

11
00:01:32,292 --> 00:01:34,351
Please!

12
00:01:34,394 --> 00:01:36,988
Please, someone help me.

13
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:39,123
Please.
Please.

14
00:02:23,143 --> 00:02:25,338
Hey.

15
00:02:25,378 --> 00:02:27,573
Lieutenant.

16
00:02:28,648 --> 00:02:30,548
Any idea who she is?

17
00:02:30,583 --> 00:02:32,813
No.

18
00:02:32,852 --> 00:02:34,945
I didn't want to move her.

19
00:02:43,363 --> 00:02:45,524
God, it's awful.

20
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:50,168
There are grass stains on her pants.

21
00:02:50,203 --> 00:02:52,171
He dragged her.

22
00:02:55,575 --> 00:02:57,236
You okay?

23
00:02:57,277 --> 00:02:59,040
Did you just touch me?

24
00:02:59,078 --> 00:03:01,069
Huh-uh.

25
00:03:02,949 --> 00:03:04,814
Wow.

26
00:03:04,851 --> 00:03:07,445
I've had way too much coffee.

27
00:03:08,988 --> 00:03:10,888
Um...

28
00:03:10,924 --> 00:03:14,155
looks like there's some kind of
white hair on her jacket.

29
00:03:14,194 --> 00:03:16,992
- Maybe animal fur?
- Man: Yeah, I saw that.

30
00:03:24,204 --> 00:03:26,672
- Watch your step.
- I know.

31
00:03:46,125 --> 00:03:47,956
Think it's hers?

32
00:03:47,994 --> 00:03:50,155
Yeah.

33
00:03:50,196 --> 00:03:52,130
How do you know?

34
00:03:52,165 --> 00:03:55,430
He raped her and then
strangled her to death.

35
00:03:57,036 --> 00:03:59,163
Then put her pants back on?

36
00:03:59,205 --> 00:04:01,298
That's my guess.

37
00:04:15,221 --> 00:04:16,745
There you are.

38
00:04:17,857 --> 00:04:19,916
Here.

39
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:22,257
- Brought you some tea.
- Thanks.

40
00:04:22,295 --> 00:04:24,229
You're welcome.

41
00:04:30,169 --> 00:04:32,569
You making a war room?

42
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:37,735
Carla had asthma.
I think the cat hair was in the car.

43
00:04:37,777 --> 00:04:40,075
Uh-huh.

44
00:04:45,418 --> 00:04:47,716
So...

45
00:04:49,122 --> 00:04:51,147
you're not gonna, um...

46
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:53,886
stay up all night with this stuff,
are you?

47
00:04:53,926 --> 00:04:55,553
No.

48
00:04:55,595 --> 00:04:57,790
It's couple's night.
I'm sleeping with you.

49
00:04:57,830 --> 00:04:59,798
Uh-huh.

50
00:04:59,832 --> 00:05:01,732
When?

51
00:05:01,768 --> 00:05:03,599
Soon.

52
00:05:03,636 --> 00:05:05,194
Good.

53
00:05:35,168 --> 00:05:37,728
- Don't be mad.
- I'm not.

54
00:05:41,207 --> 00:05:42,970
Can I ask you one question?

55
00:05:45,144 --> 00:05:47,009
What?

56
00:05:48,147 --> 00:05:50,445
Why do you think she got in the car?

57
00:05:56,656 --> 00:05:58,248
It's kind of late, honey.

58
00:05:58,291 --> 00:06:00,486
Why don't you give it a rest, huh?

59
00:06:11,671 --> 00:06:13,605
Why did you get in the car?

60
00:06:23,316 --> 00:06:26,444
Man: The FBI seems to agree
with the initial profiles.

61
00:06:26,486 --> 00:06:28,920
They feel there's a good chance
the killer's out of state;

62
00:06:28,955 --> 00:06:31,389
sloppy, low intelligence;

63
00:06:31,424 --> 00:06:34,916
someone with a knowledge
of Rochester who resides elsewhere;

64
00:06:34,961 --> 00:06:37,555
probably a marginal type personality.

65
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,934
Okay, Megan.

66
00:06:42,969 --> 00:06:46,029
He's not sloppy.
He didn't choose her at random.

67
00:06:46,072 --> 00:06:49,439
And we're wasting our time looking
for truck drivers and transients.

68
00:06:49,475 --> 00:06:51,238
The guy chased her in reverse
in broad daylight

69
00:06:51,277 --> 00:06:53,268
in front of a dozen witnesses,
for Christ's sakes.

70
00:06:53,312 --> 00:06:55,507
The kid got lucky for 20 seconds.

71
00:06:55,548 --> 00:06:58,312
He's cold and calculating
and he's gonna do it again.

72
00:06:58,351 --> 00:07:00,012
No, we don't have a serial killer.

73
00:07:00,052 --> 00:07:02,987
He's an emotional impulse-driven
bumbling fuck up.

74
00:07:03,022 --> 00:07:05,855
He's probably 1000 miles
from here running in terror.

75
00:07:07,393 --> 00:07:09,452
What do you think, Ken?

76
00:07:14,367 --> 00:07:16,892
Carla Castillo was a smart kid.

77
00:07:18,037 --> 00:07:20,403
I don't think she's get
into a car with anyone

78
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:24,376
who looked like even
a marginal transient.

79
00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:27,106
I'm not saying the guy looks
like fucking Leatherface.

80
00:07:27,146 --> 00:07:28,545
I'm saying...

81
00:07:28,581 --> 00:07:30,879
The crime scene had all the earmarks
of a disorganized killer.

82
00:07:30,917 --> 00:07:33,317
Do you know how many people have
the same first and last initial?

83
00:07:33,352 --> 00:07:35,320
2%.

84
00:07:35,354 --> 00:07:39,120
So the killer found a way to get
Carla Castillo into his car

85
00:07:39,158 --> 00:07:41,456
and he drove her to Churchville.
That is not random.

86
00:07:41,494 --> 00:07:44,019
- It might be.
- It's got nothing to do with the initials.

87
00:07:44,063 --> 00:07:45,928
He watched her for a long time.

88
00:07:45,965 --> 00:07:49,128
He waited and he did it exactly
the way he wanted to.

89
00:07:49,168 --> 00:07:52,160
Any loss of control he displays
is intentional.

90
00:07:52,205 --> 00:07:54,503
Megan, we've interviewed everybody
who ever met this girl

91
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:56,269
and we've got nothing.

92
00:07:56,309 --> 00:07:58,777
Well, please let me interview them again.

93
00:08:51,998 --> 00:08:53,966
Mr. Castillo?

94
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,332
Hey.
You have news?

95
00:08:56,369 --> 00:08:58,303
No.
Nothing concrete yet.

96
00:08:58,337 --> 00:09:01,363
No.
You're here to see me then?

97
00:09:01,407 --> 00:09:04,968
Yeah. I was hoping maybe
we could talk a little more.

98
00:09:05,011 --> 00:09:06,945
Can I get you something?

99
00:09:06,979 --> 00:09:08,606
Hank, this lady is a police officer.

100
00:09:08,648 --> 00:09:10,616
Oh.
Soda? Something?

101
00:09:10,650 --> 00:09:11,878
No, thank you.

102
00:09:11,918 --> 00:09:13,783
How about some coffee?
Just made it fresh.

103
00:09:13,819 --> 00:09:16,379
That would be great.
Thanks.

104
00:09:16,422 --> 00:09:18,720
- Let's go upstairs.
- Okay.

105
00:09:20,459 --> 00:09:23,087
Megan:
Was Tuesday the only day you saw Carla?

106
00:09:23,129 --> 00:09:26,292
Pretty much, usually.
Her mother and I had a falling out.

107
00:09:26,332 --> 00:09:29,768
I would like to have seen
her more, don't get me wrong.

108
00:09:29,802 --> 00:09:32,362
And what would you do?

109
00:09:32,405 --> 00:09:35,101
Have dinner.

110
00:09:35,141 --> 00:09:37,200
Watch TV.
Talk.

111
00:09:37,243 --> 00:09:39,370
What did she like to eat?

112
00:09:40,613 --> 00:09:43,446
You think I had something to do
with what happened, huh?

113
00:09:43,482 --> 00:09:45,746
No.

114
00:09:45,785 --> 00:09:48,413
Then why are you asking me
this stuff again?

115
00:09:48,454 --> 00:09:51,912
I want to find the man that hurt
your daughter, Jay.

116
00:09:51,958 --> 00:09:54,791
I need to understand everything
that was happening

117
00:09:54,827 --> 00:09:56,556
because anything could be important.

118
00:09:58,764 --> 00:10:01,198
Spaghetti, French fries,

119
00:10:01,233 --> 00:10:03,428
Chinese takeout,

120
00:10:03,469 --> 00:10:05,994
tacos from the deli.

121
00:10:06,038 --> 00:10:07,699
Great.

122
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:11,506
In some of the photos she's wearing
a medallion of some kind.

123
00:10:11,544 --> 00:10:14,035
Jay:
St. Philomena.

124
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:17,208
The patron saint of children.

125
00:10:17,249 --> 00:10:18,682
Her grandmother gave her that.

126
00:10:18,718 --> 00:10:20,686
I haven't found it.

127
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:23,655
She wasn't wearing it and it wasn't
recovered at the scene.

128
00:10:31,897 --> 00:10:34,058
Maybe she lost it.

129
00:10:35,968 --> 00:10:38,937
What did she talk about
when she came over?

130
00:10:40,206 --> 00:10:43,573
Schoolwork, friends...

131
00:10:44,610 --> 00:10:47,773
kid stuff, like I told you.

132
00:10:53,986 --> 00:10:55,977
You okay?

133
00:10:58,224 --> 00:11:00,590
Yes.

134
00:11:00,626 --> 00:11:02,594
Um, sorry.

135
00:11:02,628 --> 00:11:04,391
What were her friends' names?

136
00:11:23,082 --> 00:11:25,482
Carla saw her father on Tuesdays?

137
00:11:25,518 --> 00:11:27,543
Yes.

138
00:11:27,586 --> 00:11:30,111
Until 6:00
or 7:00 at night?

139
00:11:30,156 --> 00:11:32,716
That's right.

140
00:11:32,758 --> 00:11:36,421
I spoke to the bus drivers
who run that route on Tuesdays.

141
00:11:36,462 --> 00:11:38,589
They weren't very helpful.

142
00:11:38,631 --> 00:11:41,498
They couldn't remember
whether or not they saw her.

143
00:11:42,835 --> 00:11:45,303
Carla was a quiet girl.

144
00:11:45,337 --> 00:11:48,773
You would not even notice
when she was in the room.

145
00:11:50,876 --> 00:11:53,709
Was there anyone else
she regularly visited?

146
00:11:53,746 --> 00:11:55,304
Other family?

147
00:11:55,347 --> 00:11:57,474
No.

148
00:11:57,516 --> 00:11:59,711
Jay's mom.

149
00:12:01,187 --> 00:12:04,418
She was the only family
in Rochester.

150
00:12:04,457 --> 00:12:07,017
She died about a month ago.

151
00:12:08,194 --> 00:12:10,822
We didn't get along well
when she was alive.

152
00:12:12,531 --> 00:12:15,022
We hadn't seen her in years.

153
00:12:15,067 --> 00:12:18,434
Did Carla have any older friends
that you might have forgotten?

154
00:12:18,471 --> 00:12:20,405
You asked me all this before.

155
00:12:20,439 --> 00:12:24,034
I really want to help you
but I don't know how.

156
00:12:25,911 --> 00:12:28,106
I'm so sorry, I...

157
00:12:30,015 --> 00:12:32,677
I just don't feel good.

158
00:12:32,718 --> 00:12:35,118
Okay.

159
00:12:35,154 --> 00:12:38,021
Do you mind if I look
in her room again?

160
00:13:54,633 --> 00:13:57,431
Carla, what are you hiding?

161
00:14:31,136 --> 00:14:33,263
Carla's voice:
Megan.

162
00:14:34,273 --> 00:14:36,366
Megan.

163
00:14:38,077 --> 00:14:40,272
Hey.

164
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:43,839
I'm... I'm sorry.
L...

165
00:14:44,984 --> 00:14:47,646
I was looking under the bed
and I was startled.

166
00:14:47,686 --> 00:14:49,483
You should go.

167
00:14:54,426 --> 00:14:56,291
I apologize.

168
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:17,542
Uh-huh.

169
00:15:33,732 --> 00:15:35,859
Where are you?

170
00:16:03,062 --> 00:16:06,862
Um, it's time for you to stop
working on Castillo.

171
00:16:10,269 --> 00:16:12,066
It's...

172
00:16:14,073 --> 00:16:16,405
It's just that it's having
a bad effect on you.

173
00:16:16,442 --> 00:16:18,842
People are complaining
about your behavior.

174
00:16:18,877 --> 00:16:20,276
What people?

175
00:16:22,548 --> 00:16:27,508
Look, Ray, you know
I get a little bit obsessed.

176
00:16:27,553 --> 00:16:29,384
That's my process.

177
00:16:29,421 --> 00:16:31,981
And yes, I know that can be
spooky to some people.

178
00:16:32,024 --> 00:16:34,686
Everyone has given credible deference
to your process, Megan.

179
00:16:34,727 --> 00:16:37,389
And because of your track record...

180
00:16:38,931 --> 00:16:41,365
it may be too much though.

181
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:43,960
People say they've seen you

182
00:16:44,003 --> 00:16:46,233
talking to yourself.

183
00:16:47,706 --> 00:16:49,367
That's bullshit.

184
00:16:49,408 --> 00:16:51,501
Yeah.

185
00:16:51,543 --> 00:16:53,704
This is the number of my psychologist.

186
00:16:55,748 --> 00:16:57,943
She's been incredibly
helpful to me.

187
00:16:57,983 --> 00:17:00,213
- It's bullshit, Captain.
- No no, shh.

188
00:17:00,252 --> 00:17:02,914
She's expecting your call.

189
00:17:02,955 --> 00:17:05,753
So what I want you to do is take
the vacation time you saved up

190
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:08,419
and just, you know, cool out
and get a handle on things.

191
00:17:12,765 --> 00:17:14,255
I'm not going to stop.

192
00:17:18,337 --> 00:17:20,237
You most certainly are.

193
00:17:49,802 --> 00:17:53,431
Carla's voice:
Megan, help me.

194
00:17:54,907 --> 00:17:57,876
Help me, Megan.

195
00:17:57,910 --> 00:18:01,903
Help me.
Why don't you help me?

196
00:18:01,947 --> 00:18:05,075
Help me.
Help me.

197
00:18:05,117 --> 00:18:07,779
Help me.
Help me, Megan.

198
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:09,913
- Tell me.
- Yes.

199
00:18:09,955 --> 00:18:11,946
Carla's voice: I'm dead.
'Cause I'm dead.

200
00:18:11,990 --> 00:18:14,788
'Cause I'm dead.

201
00:18:17,963 --> 00:18:20,124
I'm so sorry, Carla.

202
00:18:22,301 --> 00:18:24,963
I can't find him.

203
00:18:36,348 --> 00:18:38,782
Please.

204
00:18:38,817 --> 00:18:42,184
I don't even sleep anymore.

205
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:48,817
Carla's voice:
Help me! Help me!

206
00:18:48,861 --> 00:18:51,796
Help me!

207
00:19:00,572 --> 00:19:02,199
Help me!

208
00:19:33,005 --> 00:19:34,870
Honey?

209
00:19:44,716 --> 00:19:48,152
Jesus. Megan!

210
00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:49,848
Megan!

211
00:20:12,945 --> 00:20:14,776
Thank you.

212
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:20,775
Hi.

213
00:20:20,819 --> 00:20:23,583
- How's she doing?
- Stable.

214
00:20:25,123 --> 00:20:27,284
What happened?

215
00:20:27,326 --> 00:20:30,352
I believe she's had
what is referred to

216
00:20:30,395 --> 00:20:33,455
as an adult onset of schizophrenia.

217
00:20:33,498 --> 00:20:35,659
Schizophrenia?

218
00:20:35,701 --> 00:20:37,931
How is that possible?

219
00:20:37,970 --> 00:20:40,268
She's been normal
her whole life.

220
00:20:41,373 --> 00:20:43,933
Has she had some sort
of trauma recently?

221
00:20:45,777 --> 00:20:47,745
I mean, she was...

222
00:20:47,779 --> 00:20:50,407
I don't know if it was traumatic or not,

223
00:20:50,449 --> 00:20:54,647
but she was recently taken off
the Carla Castillo investigation.

224
00:20:56,888 --> 00:20:58,651
What now?

225
00:20:58,690 --> 00:21:01,659
I mean, will she get better?

226
00:21:03,695 --> 00:21:05,788
We've got a long road ahead.

227
00:21:22,281 --> 00:21:24,511
Carla's voice:
Help me.

228
00:21:24,616 --> 00:21:27,881
Tim: It's like my brain would be
trapped in a loop.

229
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:31,082
There's no way to stop it.

230
00:21:31,123 --> 00:21:34,581
Just the same upsetting,
awful thoughts over and over.

231
00:21:34,626 --> 00:21:38,027
<i>I would just be racked with panic 24l7.</i>

232
00:21:39,364 --> 00:21:41,924
My family has trouble understanding

233
00:21:41,967 --> 00:21:44,527
why I did the things I did.

234
00:21:47,406 --> 00:21:49,306
I guess I can't blame them.

235
00:21:49,341 --> 00:21:51,809
But I wish they would talk to me.

236
00:21:53,745 --> 00:21:56,009
Anyway, my doctor's
changing medication

237
00:21:56,048 --> 00:21:57,675
and they seem to be helping again.

238
00:21:59,851 --> 00:22:01,842
Lawyer says the charges
might be dropped,

239
00:22:01,887 --> 00:22:04,219
so I guess things are looking up.

240
00:22:06,925 --> 00:22:09,393
Richard:
Thank you for sharing that with us.

241
00:22:09,428 --> 00:22:12,454
I can relate completely
to your wanting your family

242
00:22:12,497 --> 00:22:14,431
to talk with you.

243
00:22:14,466 --> 00:22:16,832
I put myself in this chair

244
00:22:16,868 --> 00:22:20,395
by crashing my brother's Lexus
into a wall.

245
00:22:20,439 --> 00:22:22,669
It didn't work.
He still didn't speak to me.

246
00:22:24,409 --> 00:22:26,502
And now he's gone.

247
00:22:26,545 --> 00:22:28,945
But, uh...

248
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:31,312
does anybody else wanna...?

249
00:22:33,251 --> 00:22:36,914
Well, a lot of what Tim
was saying sounded familiar.

250
00:22:38,156 --> 00:22:40,750
I lost my fiancée to my disease.

251
00:22:40,792 --> 00:22:42,726
I lost my career.

252
00:22:42,761 --> 00:22:44,786
I was well respected

253
00:22:44,830 --> 00:22:47,298
but now I realize

254
00:22:47,332 --> 00:22:49,630
that a good deal of my success

255
00:22:49,668 --> 00:22:53,195
came from the way I would fixate

256
00:22:53,238 --> 00:22:56,036
when I was on a case.

257
00:22:56,074 --> 00:22:59,635
I guess I would go a bit manic,

258
00:22:59,678 --> 00:23:03,114
which would sometimes
allow me an insight.

259
00:23:05,751 --> 00:23:09,243
I guess I was able
to keep it under control,

260
00:23:09,287 --> 00:23:12,222
to sort of channel it
for a while.

261
00:23:12,257 --> 00:23:14,782
But two years ago

262
00:23:14,826 --> 00:23:18,125
I had a case that...
I don't know,

263
00:23:18,163 --> 00:23:20,631
blew my circuits.

264
00:23:21,933 --> 00:23:25,460
My failure to solve it
left me desolate.

265
00:23:25,504 --> 00:23:28,337
I couldn't get it
out of my mind.

266
00:23:28,373 --> 00:23:30,603
I was hallucinating around it

267
00:23:30,642 --> 00:23:34,806
and I couldn't imagine a time

268
00:23:34,846 --> 00:23:38,475
when it wasn't with me
constantly.

269
00:23:38,517 --> 00:23:41,953
So I tried to kill myself.

270
00:23:44,022 --> 00:23:46,081
But now the doctors say

271
00:23:46,124 --> 00:23:48,422
that by doing all the right things,

272
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:51,327
ignoring my ghosts,

273
00:23:51,363 --> 00:23:54,059
trusting my safe people...

274
00:23:54,099 --> 00:23:58,126
Parks and, well, you...

275
00:23:58,170 --> 00:24:01,606
that I have a pretty good chance at

276
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:04,734
leading a more or less
functional life.

277
00:24:06,611 --> 00:24:08,272
Richard:
So you're back at work?

278
00:24:08,313 --> 00:24:10,213
Rubber gun division.

279
00:24:10,248 --> 00:24:13,115
They have to give me a job
or the union will go after the city.

280
00:24:13,151 --> 00:24:14,482
Oh.

281
00:24:14,519 --> 00:24:16,680
So they have me in
the records department

282
00:24:16,721 --> 00:24:19,246
where I won't get
in any trouble.

283
00:24:19,291 --> 00:24:21,225
It's better than it sounds.

284
00:24:21,259 --> 00:24:24,956
Does your ex...
he still works there?

285
00:24:24,996 --> 00:24:26,293
- Oh yeah.
- Yeah?

286
00:24:26,331 --> 00:24:29,357
He's made captain.
So he's the boss.

287
00:24:29,401 --> 00:24:31,699
I have him to thank for the job.

288
00:24:31,736 --> 00:24:33,704
But if it weren't for you,

289
00:24:33,738 --> 00:24:35,467
I never would have made
it out of Park Ridge.

290
00:24:35,507 --> 00:24:38,442
No no. Now that's the first
dumb thing I've heard you say.

291
00:24:38,477 --> 00:24:40,945
Well, then you haven't been listening.

292
00:24:40,979 --> 00:24:43,072
What about you?

293
00:24:43,114 --> 00:24:45,878
- Are you heading back to work?
- No no.

294
00:24:45,917 --> 00:24:48,317
My doctor said I have to stay
away from calculators.

295
00:24:48,353 --> 00:24:50,981
I know what you must have
gone through.

296
00:24:51,022 --> 00:24:53,684
Numbers are a bitch.

297
00:24:53,725 --> 00:24:56,751
I used to calculate the probability
of different scenarios

298
00:24:56,795 --> 00:24:58,524
over and over.

299
00:24:58,563 --> 00:25:01,589
Like the chance that
the three C's were random.

300
00:25:01,633 --> 00:25:04,227
Your Castillo murder case?

301
00:25:04,269 --> 00:25:07,432
Yeah.
If 2% of the population

302
00:25:07,472 --> 00:25:10,236
have matching first and last initials

303
00:25:10,275 --> 00:25:13,540
what are the chances
that Carla Castillo

304
00:25:13,578 --> 00:25:16,911
would be dumped in a town
that started with the letter C?

305
00:25:16,948 --> 00:25:19,246
I'd plug in different variables

306
00:25:19,284 --> 00:25:22,344
but I never got a number
that was lower than one in 1400.

307
00:25:26,825 --> 00:25:28,690
You may never know.

308
00:25:30,228 --> 00:25:32,219
And you may have to live with that.

309
00:25:37,502 --> 00:25:39,697
You're a smart crazy, Ledge.

310
00:26:47,138 --> 00:26:48,901
Where is it?

311
00:27:08,326 --> 00:27:11,227
Jean, it's the little girl.

312
00:27:11,262 --> 00:27:13,856
It's the Walsh girl.

313
00:27:13,898 --> 00:27:16,526
Megan:
He has six outstanding tickets.

314
00:27:16,568 --> 00:27:18,934
Yes, you can impound his car.

315
00:27:18,970 --> 00:27:20,870
No problem.

316
00:27:31,316 --> 00:27:34,080
- Hey, guys, what's up?
- Nothing.

317
00:27:43,361 --> 00:27:45,522
Angelo, get down there.
See if you can get me a witness.

318
00:27:45,563 --> 00:27:47,531
Go now.
Go ahead.

319
00:27:49,467 --> 00:27:51,162
How did the press
find out about that?

320
00:27:51,202 --> 00:27:53,193
- Ken.
- Not now.

321
00:27:53,238 --> 00:27:55,138
No, go ahead, Bob.
Continue.

322
00:27:55,173 --> 00:27:57,004
What?

323
00:28:26,571 --> 00:28:30,598
Wendy Walsh, driven 30 miles
to be killed in Webster.

324
00:28:33,144 --> 00:28:34,577
Why are you looking at me like that?

325
00:28:34,612 --> 00:28:36,375
I'm not gonna freak out.

326
00:28:36,414 --> 00:28:38,746
Okay, so you were right.

327
00:28:38,783 --> 00:28:40,944
But that doesn't alter
the fact that you...

328
00:28:40,985 --> 00:28:42,782
Had a meltdown?
I know.

329
00:28:42,821 --> 00:28:44,288
How did he strangle her?

330
00:28:46,057 --> 00:28:48,992
Oh, come on, Ken.
How did he do it?

331
00:28:50,695 --> 00:28:52,629
There hasn't been a autopsy yet.

332
00:28:52,664 --> 00:28:56,259
From the marks on her neck
it doesn't look like he used his hands.

333
00:29:00,371 --> 00:29:02,168
He used a belt

334
00:29:02,207 --> 00:29:05,005
from behind, okay?

335
00:29:06,211 --> 00:29:08,406
Look, Meg,

336
00:29:08,446 --> 00:29:10,038
this is pointless.

337
00:29:10,081 --> 00:29:12,242
You're not an investigator anymore.

338
00:29:27,298 --> 00:29:29,630
I can help.
You know it.

339
00:29:29,667 --> 00:29:33,103
Look, Meg,

340
00:29:33,138 --> 00:29:35,698
I don't think you should
take on the stress, okay?

341
00:29:35,740 --> 00:29:37,332
Ken, I'm fine.

342
00:29:37,375 --> 00:29:39,707
Look, I'm taking medication.

343
00:29:39,744 --> 00:29:41,006
I know the warning signs.

344
00:29:41,045 --> 00:29:43,104
I'm in a support group.
I'm in therapy.

345
00:29:43,148 --> 00:29:44,809
I'm not gonna snap

346
00:29:44,849 --> 00:29:46,646
and I need to do this.

347
00:29:46,684 --> 00:29:48,447
- You want more coffee?
- No, thank you.

348
00:29:48,486 --> 00:29:50,454
Yes, fill his cup.

349
00:29:50,488 --> 00:29:52,615
He can't go home yet.

350
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:58,488
There was cat hair,
wasn't there?

351
00:30:01,232 --> 00:30:03,826
I knew it.
I knew it last time.

352
00:30:03,868 --> 00:30:06,496
Let me help you, please, Ken.

353
00:30:11,442 --> 00:30:13,603
You can ride with Harper

354
00:30:13,645 --> 00:30:16,375
on a trial basis, okay?

355
00:30:16,414 --> 00:30:18,348
You're a consultant only.

356
00:30:18,383 --> 00:30:21,443
You observe, advise
and consult, that's it.

357
00:30:21,486 --> 00:30:23,784
You don't conduct interviews
on your own.

358
00:30:23,822 --> 00:30:25,449
He takes the lead.

359
00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:27,890
You don't handle evidence,
you don't go near evidence.

360
00:30:27,926 --> 00:30:31,487
If we catch this guy I don't want
some defense attorney

361
00:30:31,529 --> 00:30:35,659
using your mental history
to destroy our case.

362
00:30:39,304 --> 00:30:42,137
Jesus, this is a bad idea.

363
00:30:44,342 --> 00:30:46,776
And you don't load your weapon,
all right?

364
00:30:46,811 --> 00:30:50,076
Ken, this is a good idea.

365
00:30:50,114 --> 00:30:52,014
You want to catch him too.

366
00:30:52,050 --> 00:30:53,881
Can I finish eating now, please?

367
00:30:53,918 --> 00:30:55,146
Yes.

368
00:30:55,186 --> 00:30:57,154
Thank you.

369
00:30:57,188 --> 00:30:59,156
You meeting Eileen?

370
00:31:00,325 --> 00:31:02,885
How'd you know?

371
00:31:02,927 --> 00:31:05,259
Everyone knows.

372
00:31:05,296 --> 00:31:08,356
She's very pretty.

373
00:31:10,501 --> 00:31:12,298
Thanks.

374
00:31:29,454 --> 00:31:31,046
Ken:
Everyone in this room,

375
00:31:31,089 --> 00:31:33,023
you are now assigned
to the task force

376
00:31:33,057 --> 00:31:35,491
for the Castillo-Walsh
investigations full time.

377
00:31:35,526 --> 00:31:39,121
I want you to clear your desks
of everything else you're working on.

378
00:31:39,163 --> 00:31:42,257
Now we're proceeding
with the assumption

379
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:44,894
the killings were perpetrated
by the same individual...

380
00:31:46,237 --> 00:31:50,333
and that we're dealing with
an active local serial killer.

381
00:31:50,375 --> 00:31:52,570
Both victims have traces

382
00:31:52,610 --> 00:31:55,044
of the same white cat hair
on their clothing.

383
00:31:55,079 --> 00:31:57,479
Now in the matter of the Walsh killing,

384
00:31:57,515 --> 00:32:00,109
we have jurisdiction
over the kidnapping only.

385
00:32:00,151 --> 00:32:02,449
Since the murder took place
in Webster,

386
00:32:02,487 --> 00:32:05,217
we're gonna be sharing the case
with Webster PD

387
00:32:05,256 --> 00:32:07,156
who have promised
to cooperate fully.

388
00:32:08,359 --> 00:32:10,589
Ken:
Biggs, you'll be coordinating with them.

389
00:32:10,628 --> 00:32:14,120
Now I want all known pedophiles
in the area questioned.

390
00:32:14,165 --> 00:32:16,963
I want surveillance on the dump sites,

391
00:32:17,001 --> 00:32:18,832
the victim's graves

392
00:32:18,870 --> 00:32:21,532
and the general neighborhoods
from where the girls disappeared.

393
00:32:23,441 --> 00:32:25,306
Now I'm sure I don't have
to remind you all

394
00:32:25,343 --> 00:32:28,801
to conduct yourselves calmly
and professionally.

395
00:32:32,216 --> 00:32:34,946
Okay, that's it.
Harper, I need a word with you.

396
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:58,307
I charted everywhere
Carla commonly went.

397
00:32:58,343 --> 00:33:00,937
Blue means by bus,
red means on foot.

398
00:33:00,979 --> 00:33:03,709
There's got to be some crossover
with Wendy somewhere.

399
00:33:11,022 --> 00:33:13,456
- What?
- Nothing.

400
00:33:14,826 --> 00:33:16,726
What's on your mind, Harper?

401
00:33:16,761 --> 00:33:18,592
Honesty breeds trust.

402
00:33:18,629 --> 00:33:20,961
No it doesn't.

403
00:33:22,233 --> 00:33:25,259
All right, come on.
Just say it.

404
00:33:25,303 --> 00:33:27,567
What, you think I'm going
to endanger you?

405
00:33:27,605 --> 00:33:30,403
I think you're gonna endanger this case

406
00:33:30,441 --> 00:33:32,773
and possibly yourself.

407
00:33:32,810 --> 00:33:35,404
I think you were an excellent detective

408
00:33:35,446 --> 00:33:38,108
who should've accepted full disability
for your mental illness.

409
00:33:38,149 --> 00:33:41,641
I know that the department
keeps you around out of pity.

410
00:33:41,686 --> 00:33:44,712
And I think the captain's
decision is insane

411
00:33:44,756 --> 00:33:47,691
and it wouldn't happen if it weren't
for your past relationship.

412
00:33:47,725 --> 00:33:49,556
You trust me now?

413
00:33:53,564 --> 00:33:55,464
I can help with this.

414
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:58,435
Honey, Captain tells me you're gonna
consult, you're gonna consult.

415
00:33:58,469 --> 00:34:00,164
What the hell can I do about it?

416
00:34:00,204 --> 00:34:02,729
Just keep in the back
and stay out of the way.

417
00:34:06,344 --> 00:34:08,107
You think it's okay
to call me honey?

418
00:34:10,114 --> 00:34:13,174
No, that was inappropriate.

419
00:34:15,820 --> 00:34:17,754
Apology accepted.

420
00:34:20,158 --> 00:34:22,956
Harper: Was there anyone who took
an unusual interest in Wendy?

421
00:34:27,331 --> 00:34:28,696
Unusual, no.

422
00:34:30,068 --> 00:34:32,434
She was a great kid.

423
00:34:32,470 --> 00:34:34,370
Everyone liked her.

424
00:34:34,405 --> 00:34:38,205
She was baptized.
Are you active in the church?

425
00:34:38,242 --> 00:34:40,767
We go...

426
00:34:40,812 --> 00:34:44,145
we went to...

427
00:34:44,182 --> 00:34:48,141
Mass on Sundays
at St. Michael's

428
00:34:48,186 --> 00:34:51,553
and Wendy went to a church-sponsored
camping trip last summer.

429
00:34:53,024 --> 00:34:55,356
She met her friend Zoe there.

430
00:34:57,495 --> 00:34:59,759
They used to...

431
00:35:12,276 --> 00:35:15,074
She and Zoe were best friends.

432
00:35:16,848 --> 00:35:20,147
I'd like to make a list
of all of Wendy's friends.

433
00:35:20,184 --> 00:35:23,381
Oh, they're right in her cell phone.

434
00:35:25,289 --> 00:35:27,223
Jim, would you...?

435
00:35:29,627 --> 00:35:31,652
Jim?

436
00:35:40,972 --> 00:35:44,430
She'd always forget this.

437
00:35:44,475 --> 00:35:46,636
And then she wouldn't be able to

438
00:35:46,677 --> 00:35:49,874
call me when she...

439
00:35:51,616 --> 00:35:53,311
when she needed me.

440
00:35:54,952 --> 00:35:57,921
- Jim.
- When she needed me.

441
00:36:00,057 --> 00:36:02,218
Jim, let them help us, hmm?

442
00:36:04,495 --> 00:36:06,326
Let them help us.

443
00:36:06,364 --> 00:36:08,594
It's all right.

444
00:36:13,638 --> 00:36:15,936
It's all right.

445
00:36:15,973 --> 00:36:18,441
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

446
00:36:18,476 --> 00:36:20,967
Would you mind if I looked
in Wendy's room?

447
00:36:21,012 --> 00:36:23,879
No.
Right up the stairs.

448
00:37:56,173 --> 00:37:58,664
- Girl's voice: Megan.
- Hey, I just got a call.

449
00:37:58,709 --> 00:38:00,836
A homeless man
saw the abduction.

450
00:38:03,047 --> 00:38:05,447
Man:
I think I saw her, you know?

451
00:38:05,483 --> 00:38:07,417
I'm a witness, you know?

452
00:38:07,451 --> 00:38:11,217
- Hey, we got it.
- I think I'm the last person to see her.

453
00:38:13,124 --> 00:38:16,525
I was talking to her right before
she got into the car.

454
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:18,494
What did you talk to her about?

455
00:38:18,529 --> 00:38:21,896
I needed money.
Somebody stole my basket.

456
00:38:21,932 --> 00:38:24,696
I got no place to carry my stuff.

457
00:38:24,735 --> 00:38:27,295
- Did she give you money?
- No.

458
00:38:27,338 --> 00:38:29,533
What happened after she passed you?

459
00:38:31,742 --> 00:38:33,437
She walked up that way

460
00:38:33,477 --> 00:38:37,174
and then she got into a blue car.

461
00:38:37,214 --> 00:38:40,206
And I didn't see anybody after that

462
00:38:40,251 --> 00:38:42,981
'cause the driver was blocked.

463
00:38:43,020 --> 00:38:44,954
Harper: Do you have any idea
of the make of the car?

464
00:38:44,989 --> 00:38:48,516
Man:
Yeah, it was blue.

465
00:38:48,559 --> 00:38:51,653
Harper:
Do you know what kind of blue car?

466
00:38:51,696 --> 00:38:55,632
Man:
No, my eyes are not so good.

467
00:38:55,666 --> 00:38:58,794
Harper: If I showed you a picture would
you be able to identify the kind of car?

468
00:38:58,836 --> 00:39:01,703
I don't know, maybe.

469
00:39:03,874 --> 00:39:06,900
Man:
It's not right, you know?

470
00:39:06,944 --> 00:39:09,276
She wasn't bothering nobody.

471
00:39:20,624 --> 00:39:23,457
I'm only gonna ask you this once.

472
00:39:23,494 --> 00:39:26,190
Are you fucking okay?

473
00:39:26,230 --> 00:39:28,289
Yeah.

474
00:39:28,332 --> 00:39:30,698
Jesus Christ, are you kidding?

475
00:39:30,735 --> 00:39:34,694
My wrists have carpal tunnel
from typing.

476
00:39:34,739 --> 00:39:37,071
Give me a break.

477
00:39:49,286 --> 00:39:51,151
- Megan.
- Richard.

478
00:39:51,188 --> 00:39:55,056
Hey, I've been thinking about
you ever since I saw...

479
00:39:55,092 --> 00:39:57,185
what's wrong?

480
00:39:57,228 --> 00:40:00,391
- Do you have a few minutes?
- Yeah, come in.

481
00:40:03,367 --> 00:40:05,130
Megan:
I can't stop the restlessness.

482
00:40:05,169 --> 00:40:08,036
I've begun to hallucinate

483
00:40:08,072 --> 00:40:09,903
and hear voices again.

484
00:40:09,940 --> 00:40:13,808
I don't suppose you've talk
to Dr. Parks about this?

485
00:40:13,844 --> 00:40:15,812
No no.
You know what he'd say.

486
00:40:15,846 --> 00:40:19,043
Oh yeah, he'd say,

487
00:40:19,083 --> 00:40:21,074
"Megan, I think you should
be off the case.

488
00:40:21,118 --> 00:40:24,053
I think there's some
misguided martyrdom. "

489
00:40:24,088 --> 00:40:26,386
Yada yada yada.

490
00:40:26,424 --> 00:40:30,656
But still, I don't...

491
00:40:30,694 --> 00:40:33,527
I just don't know
what your suffering...

492
00:40:34,765 --> 00:40:37,928
how that's gonna help
those poor children.

493
00:40:42,406 --> 00:40:45,273
Best thing you can do
is leave Rochester.

494
00:40:45,309 --> 00:40:47,800
I won't stop.

495
00:40:49,079 --> 00:40:52,207
It's in my brain now and it's not
gonna let go until I find him.

496
00:40:52,249 --> 00:40:54,217
You do realize
that's the disease talking?

497
00:40:59,223 --> 00:41:02,215
Okay, I think we're all set.

498
00:41:02,259 --> 00:41:05,251
Yeah.

499
00:41:05,296 --> 00:41:08,231
Okay, now here's the thing:

500
00:41:08,265 --> 00:41:10,733
If you're not gonna listen to reason,

501
00:41:10,768 --> 00:41:13,498
you've got to catch this bastard
as soon as you can

502
00:41:13,537 --> 00:41:15,528
while you're still in one piece.

503
00:41:16,941 --> 00:41:18,704
Okay?

504
00:41:18,742 --> 00:41:20,607
I will.

505
00:41:34,825 --> 00:41:37,055
Carl Tanner, he's a social worker.

506
00:41:37,094 --> 00:41:40,029
- He briefly assisted the Castillos.
- What's this?

507
00:41:40,064 --> 00:41:42,225
A connection.
Carla and Wendy.

508
00:41:42,266 --> 00:41:45,394
We interviewed him two years ago but
his connection to Carla was only tenuous.

509
00:41:45,436 --> 00:41:46,960
So what's he got to do with Wendy?

510
00:41:47,004 --> 00:41:49,029
He's her father's first cousin.

511
00:41:49,073 --> 00:41:50,836
How come no one noticed this?

512
00:41:50,875 --> 00:41:53,241
He changed his name.
It used to be Walsh, now it's Tanner.

513
00:41:53,277 --> 00:41:54,904
- There's another thing.
- What?

514
00:41:54,945 --> 00:41:58,711
In 1982 he chaperoned a school trip
to a canning factory.

515
00:41:58,749 --> 00:42:00,478
A 10-year-old got separated
from the group,

516
00:42:00,518 --> 00:42:02,918
fell from a balcony and died.

517
00:42:02,953 --> 00:42:06,354
- Any evidence of foul play?
- No.

518
00:42:06,390 --> 00:42:08,051
But it's interesting.

519
00:42:15,799 --> 00:42:17,426
Harper:
You go over your notes on this guy?

520
00:42:17,468 --> 00:42:20,028
- Yeah.
- What was he like?

521
00:42:20,070 --> 00:42:22,868
Friendly, eager but not very helpful.

522
00:42:22,907 --> 00:42:24,704
How are you gonna handle him?

523
00:42:24,742 --> 00:42:27,074
You found him.

524
00:42:27,111 --> 00:42:30,410
If he's our guy he likes to feel in control.

525
00:42:30,447 --> 00:42:32,677
He thinks he's tricky and clever

526
00:42:32,716 --> 00:42:36,379
but he can only really assert dominance
against prepubescent girls.

527
00:42:36,420 --> 00:42:39,617
- He's a coward.
- Yeah.

528
00:42:39,657 --> 00:42:42,558
So how do we find out
if Carl's our boy?

529
00:42:42,593 --> 00:42:45,187
Rattle his cage
and see how he does.

530
00:42:45,229 --> 00:42:47,197
Good answer.

531
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:52,096
It's 4:00.
Who are the kids?

532
00:42:52,136 --> 00:42:55,469
After school program...
disadvantaged youth.

533
00:42:55,506 --> 00:42:57,906
Parents have drug problems.

534
00:43:03,314 --> 00:43:05,009
Megan. Megan!

535
00:43:05,049 --> 00:43:07,745
Yeah? Sorry.

536
00:43:13,824 --> 00:43:16,486
- Mr. Tanner.
- Yes?

537
00:43:16,527 --> 00:43:19,394
- We'd like a word with you.
- Sure.

538
00:43:20,698 --> 00:43:23,963
Oh, hi. I talked to you
a couple years ago about Carla.

539
00:43:24,001 --> 00:43:26,367
Step away from the children, please.

540
00:43:26,403 --> 00:43:28,371
Okay.

541
00:43:28,405 --> 00:43:31,431
Sandy, would you
watch Jenny for me, please?

542
00:43:31,475 --> 00:43:33,500
Thank you.

543
00:43:33,544 --> 00:43:36,206
So what's going on?

544
00:43:36,246 --> 00:43:38,714
How well did you know
Wendy Walsh?

545
00:43:38,749 --> 00:43:41,843
You know, I already talked to
the policeman from Webster about Wendy.

546
00:43:41,885 --> 00:43:43,443
Answer the question, please.

547
00:43:44,688 --> 00:43:47,213
Well, she was my cousin's kid.

548
00:43:47,257 --> 00:43:48,952
We weren't particularly close.

549
00:43:48,993 --> 00:43:50,961
Probably met her
about a half a dozen times.

550
00:43:50,995 --> 00:43:52,860
Why did you change your name?

551
00:43:52,896 --> 00:43:55,228
What the hell's that got
to do with anything?

552
00:43:55,265 --> 00:43:57,290
Were you trying to run
away from something?

553
00:43:57,334 --> 00:44:00,098
No, I didn't get along
with my father so...

554
00:44:00,137 --> 00:44:02,765
Children around you have
a way of ending up dead.

555
00:44:02,806 --> 00:44:06,003
- What?
- Megan: What about Monica Hailey?

556
00:44:06,043 --> 00:44:08,876
Oh my God.
Are you people kidding me?

557
00:44:10,147 --> 00:44:11,876
That was 15 years ago.

558
00:44:11,915 --> 00:44:15,009
I was nowhere near Monica.
That was Lydia's fault.

559
00:44:15,052 --> 00:44:17,384
You got to admit there are a lot
of coincidences.

560
00:44:17,421 --> 00:44:20,788
Look, I didn't do anything wrong.

561
00:44:20,824 --> 00:44:23,554
I mean, my God, I work all day
to help children.

562
00:44:23,594 --> 00:44:25,653
At night I go home to my wife.

563
00:44:25,696 --> 00:44:28,221
Talk to those other cops.
I told them everything.

564
00:44:29,833 --> 00:44:30,993
Harper:
So what do you think?

565
00:44:31,035 --> 00:44:34,061
- He's convincing.
- Yeah.

566
00:44:34,104 --> 00:44:36,231
You know what would have
helped a hell of a lot?

567
00:44:36,273 --> 00:44:38,173
Is knowing what Webster
got out of him.

568
00:44:38,208 --> 00:44:40,073
No kidding.

569
00:44:40,110 --> 00:44:41,668
Where to next?

570
00:44:41,712 --> 00:44:43,873
Webster.

571
00:44:45,949 --> 00:44:48,713
I'm sorry for the holdup.

572
00:44:48,752 --> 00:44:52,188
Detective Harper, Officer Paige.

573
00:44:52,222 --> 00:44:54,656
Your reputation precedes you,
young lady.

574
00:44:54,692 --> 00:44:56,956
A mixed blessing for sure.

575
00:44:56,994 --> 00:44:59,360
Not at all.
How can I help you?

576
00:45:00,464 --> 00:45:03,399
As you know,
Rochester and Webster

577
00:45:03,434 --> 00:45:05,299
are covering a lot
of the same ground.

578
00:45:05,335 --> 00:45:07,826
We're anxious to pool our resources.

579
00:45:07,871 --> 00:45:10,101
Well, I think that's a great idea.

580
00:45:10,140 --> 00:45:12,370
We're gonna do everything
we can to help you.

581
00:45:12,409 --> 00:45:15,276
Perfect. We'd like to talk
to the officers

582
00:45:15,312 --> 00:45:17,644
who interviewed Carl Tanner,
the social worker.

583
00:45:19,616 --> 00:45:23,108
I'm sorry, but everyone's
in the field at the moment.

584
00:45:24,655 --> 00:45:27,317
Then we'd like to see the reports.

585
00:45:28,892 --> 00:45:31,087
Carl Tanner.

586
00:45:31,128 --> 00:45:33,153
I'll have somebody dig up
that information

587
00:45:33,197 --> 00:45:35,188
and get it to you
just as soon as I can.

588
00:45:35,232 --> 00:45:37,598
We've taken an interest
in him as a suspect

589
00:45:37,634 --> 00:45:40,159
We really need to see this today.

590
00:45:43,907 --> 00:45:47,001
Detective Harper,
we're real anxious to help you

591
00:45:47,044 --> 00:45:50,275
solve the kidnapping
aspects of this crime,

592
00:45:50,314 --> 00:45:53,477
but it's a little hectic around here at the
moment because we're solving a murder

593
00:45:53,517 --> 00:45:56,486
and I just do not have the resources

594
00:45:56,520 --> 00:45:59,956
to just drop everything
and play fetch for you.

595
00:46:01,091 --> 00:46:02,991
Fuck!
Son of a bitch.

596
00:46:03,026 --> 00:46:06,792
Well, I guess now Webster's gonna place
Carl Tanner at the top of their list.

597
00:46:06,830 --> 00:46:09,890
Yeah, we blew it.

598
00:46:09,933 --> 00:46:13,300
I always heard he was an asshole.
We should have been ready for it.

599
00:46:13,337 --> 00:46:15,328
We were perfectly reasonable.

600
00:46:15,372 --> 00:46:18,170
And he took it as a challenge,
an affront to his authority.

601
00:46:18,208 --> 00:46:20,233
We should have flattered him.

602
00:46:22,179 --> 00:46:24,272
You're an attractive woman,
we could have used that.

603
00:46:24,314 --> 00:46:26,248
What are you saying?

604
00:46:26,283 --> 00:46:28,649
You want me to go back
and shake my tits for him?

605
00:46:28,685 --> 00:46:31,085
Sorry, I'm just...

606
00:46:31,121 --> 00:46:33,089
I would have done it
if I thought it might help.

607
00:46:36,827 --> 00:46:38,590
How are you doing?

608
00:46:38,629 --> 00:46:41,257
So you can go back
and report to Kenneth?

609
00:46:41,298 --> 00:46:43,323
I'm just concerned.

610
00:46:43,367 --> 00:46:46,427
I'm hanging in there.
Thanks.

611
00:47:10,360 --> 00:47:12,851
Melissa Maestro.

612
00:47:12,896 --> 00:47:16,093
- Melissa Maestro.
- Shut up.

613
00:47:16,133 --> 00:47:18,226
Her name is Melissa Maestro.

614
00:47:18,268 --> 00:47:21,760
- MM, y'all.
- You're gonna get raped.

615
00:47:21,805 --> 00:47:23,739
He's gonna take you to Mortimer.

616
00:47:23,774 --> 00:47:26,334
She's gonna die in Mortimer.

617
00:47:42,793 --> 00:47:45,626
- There's a problem.
- What?

618
00:47:47,064 --> 00:47:49,726
10-year-old girl went
missing this afternoon.

619
00:47:49,766 --> 00:47:52,132
What's her name?

620
00:47:52,169 --> 00:47:54,467
Melissa Maestro.

621
00:47:56,373 --> 00:47:59,467
I thought you had a unit covering
every girl whose initials matched.

622
00:47:59,509 --> 00:48:01,704
We fucked up.

623
00:48:40,817 --> 00:48:43,786
Girl's voice:
Megan.

624
00:48:51,862 --> 00:48:54,228
Ken:
I guess Carl Tanner's off the hook.

625
00:48:54,264 --> 00:48:57,756
Meg, what have you
come up with so far?

626
00:48:57,801 --> 00:48:59,701
Any connections to the other girls?

627
00:48:59,736 --> 00:49:03,536
Melissa and Wendy both attended
St. Michael's Church.

628
00:49:03,573 --> 00:49:06,736
- And Carla?
- She lived in Greece.

629
00:49:06,777 --> 00:49:08,802
Too far a drive
from Rochester for them.

630
00:49:08,845 --> 00:49:11,336
Hmm.
Any other commonalities?

631
00:49:11,381 --> 00:49:13,076
Nothing with all three.

632
00:49:13,116 --> 00:49:16,210
Melissa and Wendy
took gymnastics at the same studio.

633
00:49:16,253 --> 00:49:18,153
Different years, different teachers.

634
00:49:18,188 --> 00:49:20,019
Ken:
Check it out. What else?

635
00:49:20,057 --> 00:49:23,618
Harper:
Carla and Melissa were both asthmatic.

636
00:49:23,660 --> 00:49:25,719
They had different doctors
but we're checking to see

637
00:49:25,762 --> 00:49:27,354
if they used the same lab.

638
00:49:27,397 --> 00:49:30,332
And Wendy and Melissa had both visited
the aquarium in the last year.

639
00:49:36,473 --> 00:49:38,498
It's a stretch.

640
00:49:38,542 --> 00:49:40,806
That's all you got?

641
00:49:47,551 --> 00:49:49,416
All right.

642
00:49:49,453 --> 00:49:51,648
Follow everything.

643
00:49:52,656 --> 00:49:56,251
And I want some results, people.
All right?

644
00:49:56,293 --> 00:49:58,784
I'd rather not have to tell
another parent in this community

645
00:49:58,829 --> 00:50:01,559
that their child has been murdered
if you don't mind.

646
00:50:10,607 --> 00:50:13,371
- There's been another killing.
- Richard: Oh Lord.

647
00:50:13,410 --> 00:50:15,674
That's not why I'm calling.

648
00:50:15,712 --> 00:50:17,805
What do you mean?

649
00:50:17,848 --> 00:50:19,645
I'm hallucinating, Richard.

650
00:50:19,683 --> 00:50:22,948
And I get these bouts
where my hands are shaking

651
00:50:22,986 --> 00:50:26,683
all over the place even though
I stopped taking the pills.

652
00:50:26,723 --> 00:50:30,420
It's the worst of both worlds.

653
00:50:30,460 --> 00:50:32,223
And I'm afraid people
are starting to notice.

654
00:50:32,262 --> 00:50:35,823
Well, you know, starting
and stopping your medication

655
00:50:35,866 --> 00:50:38,960
can be significantly worse
than not taking anything at all.

656
00:50:40,337 --> 00:50:42,669
And the stress isn't good, Megan.

657
00:50:42,706 --> 00:50:46,142
You're relapsing,
that's what's happening.

658
00:50:46,176 --> 00:50:48,041
Man on radio: We think this guy here
is the Alphabet Killer.

659
00:50:48,078 --> 00:50:49,568
Richard:
You know why.

660
00:50:49,613 --> 00:50:51,808
Man on radio:
Victim's name is Elizabeth Eckers. EE.

661
00:50:51,848 --> 00:50:54,078
- Richard, hang on one second.
- Sure.

662
00:50:54,117 --> 00:50:57,678
The suspect is holding
her hostage in the attic

663
00:50:57,721 --> 00:51:00,690
- inside the residence at 216...
- Hello, are you there?

664
00:51:00,724 --> 00:51:03,591
- I'm sorry, I've got to call you back.
- He's armed and considered dangerous.

665
00:51:24,915 --> 00:51:27,475
Officer:
Move those cars to the side.

666
00:51:31,555 --> 00:51:34,547
Baker.

667
00:51:34,591 --> 00:51:36,582
- What's the story?
- Hey, Megan.

668
00:51:36,626 --> 00:51:38,856
Guy's a volunteer at the firehouse,

669
00:51:38,895 --> 00:51:41,193
name of Len Schaefer.
He's got a history of mental illness.

670
00:51:41,231 --> 00:51:43,756
He's got two hostages up there
in his room, his mother and a girl.

671
00:51:43,800 --> 00:51:45,495
Suspect allegedly
tried to rape the girl.

672
00:51:45,535 --> 00:51:47,400
She locked herself in the bathroom
and called 911.

673
00:51:47,437 --> 00:51:49,405
- How old is she?
- 19. College student.

674
00:51:49,439 --> 00:51:51,999
19? And they're looking
for the Alphabet Killings?

675
00:51:52,042 --> 00:51:54,169
Yeah, girls name is Elizabeth Eckers.

676
00:51:55,879 --> 00:51:57,904
- Len Schaefer?
- Yeah, that's his name.

677
00:51:57,948 --> 00:52:00,348
- Baker, hold this.
- What are you doing?

678
00:52:00,383 --> 00:52:02,180
You can't go in there, Megan.

679
00:52:02,219 --> 00:52:05,211
Officer:
Wait wait! Get back!

680
00:52:08,391 --> 00:52:10,655
Hold on.

681
00:52:10,694 --> 00:52:12,184
Get back here.

682
00:52:15,866 --> 00:52:18,801
Len?
Hey, it's cool.

683
00:52:18,835 --> 00:52:21,497
I'm not carrying a gun.

684
00:52:23,406 --> 00:52:25,374
I'm coming up, okay?

685
00:52:25,408 --> 00:52:27,706
Len:
Stay the fuck away!

686
00:52:30,247 --> 00:52:33,410
Listen, my name is Megan.

687
00:52:35,085 --> 00:52:37,178
I'm not armed.

688
00:52:37,220 --> 00:52:40,451
I'll tell you, those cops out there
have got some crazy ideas.

689
00:52:40,490 --> 00:52:42,685
I'm just here to help.

690
00:52:44,528 --> 00:52:47,019
I'm coming upstairs
so I can talk to you, okay?

691
00:52:48,999 --> 00:52:52,264
I just want to talk to you.

692
00:53:08,985 --> 00:53:10,919
Len, I'm gonna come up.

693
00:53:12,389 --> 00:53:13,913
Please don't shoot me.

694
00:53:32,275 --> 00:53:33,970
Hey, Len.

695
00:53:38,415 --> 00:53:41,043
Don't move.

696
00:53:42,519 --> 00:53:45,283
Mrs. Schaefer, Elizabeth.

697
00:53:47,224 --> 00:53:48,714
What's the story?

698
00:53:48,758 --> 00:53:52,250
Beth called the fucking cops and now
they think I killed those girls.

699
00:53:52,295 --> 00:53:54,559
He tried to rape me.

700
00:53:54,598 --> 00:53:56,327
I went to the bathroom
because he was...

701
00:53:56,366 --> 00:53:58,561
You said you were getting a condom.

702
00:53:58,602 --> 00:54:00,502
You know what happens
when you drink.

703
00:54:00,537 --> 00:54:02,095
Shut up, Mom.

704
00:54:02,138 --> 00:54:05,335
Len, those cops outside
have a lot of ideas.

705
00:54:05,375 --> 00:54:07,809
I didn't kill those girls.

706
00:54:10,413 --> 00:54:12,210
That's obvious.

707
00:54:12,249 --> 00:54:14,444
What we need to do is make sure

708
00:54:14,484 --> 00:54:17,214
this gets cleared up
without anyone getting hurt.

709
00:54:17,254 --> 00:54:19,620
Do you know what
they're calling this out there?

710
00:54:21,424 --> 00:54:23,585
A hostage situation.

711
00:54:23,627 --> 00:54:26,255
- Oh, Len.
- Those fucking bastards.

712
00:54:26,296 --> 00:54:28,025
Megan:
You know what I see?

713
00:54:28,064 --> 00:54:30,760
An argument.

714
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:33,064
Does that make sense?

715
00:54:38,174 --> 00:54:39,903
Yes.

716
00:54:42,879 --> 00:54:44,540
And what do you think, Elizabeth?

717
00:54:44,581 --> 00:54:46,913
He tried to rape me!

718
00:54:53,456 --> 00:54:56,289
Which I guess led to an argument.

719
00:54:56,326 --> 00:54:58,760
Megan: See?

720
00:54:58,795 --> 00:55:00,592
Now, Len,

721
00:55:00,630 --> 00:55:03,599
she needs to go.

722
00:55:05,568 --> 00:55:07,433
She's gonna lie about me.

723
00:55:07,470 --> 00:55:10,633
And you'll have the chance
to explain that if you let her go

724
00:55:10,674 --> 00:55:13,666
and everyone sees that you
don't mean to hurt anyone.

725
00:55:14,778 --> 00:55:16,905
This was an argument.

726
00:56:00,824 --> 00:56:02,792
I didn't do anything wrong.

727
00:56:06,596 --> 00:56:08,621
I didn't do anything.

728
00:56:08,665 --> 00:56:11,361
Good.
We're good.

729
00:56:14,771 --> 00:56:18,104
I just don't like it when
everyone's mad at me.

730
00:56:24,681 --> 00:56:26,478
Megan:
Elizabeth, you can get up now.

731
00:56:28,118 --> 00:56:30,143
Officer:
Go go go go.

732
00:57:00,116 --> 00:57:03,176
- What do people call you?
- Um, Beth.

733
00:57:03,219 --> 00:57:06,188
- Not Elizabeth?
- No. Never.

734
00:57:14,297 --> 00:57:16,231
I'm so sorry, Mrs. Schaefer.

735
00:57:19,836 --> 00:57:22,828
- Get the board.
- Mrs. Schaefer?

736
00:57:22,872 --> 00:57:25,807
Here, we've got it.

737
00:57:25,842 --> 00:57:27,901
Get the defibrillator.

738
00:57:32,248 --> 00:57:34,773
He agreed to let Elizabeth leave.

739
00:57:34,818 --> 00:57:37,753
He put the gun down on the television

740
00:57:37,787 --> 00:57:39,914
and he stepped towards the window.

741
00:57:39,956 --> 00:57:43,687
He said, "I just don't like it
when everyone's mad at me. "

742
00:57:43,726 --> 00:57:45,591
And then he was shot.

743
00:57:45,628 --> 00:57:49,064
Did he pick the gun back up
before moving to the window?

744
00:57:49,098 --> 00:57:53,194
No, the gun was on the television
when he was shot.

745
00:57:55,472 --> 00:57:57,337
Sorry, got here as soon as I could.

746
00:57:57,373 --> 00:57:59,307
Megan, a word.

747
00:58:06,216 --> 00:58:08,684
Megan:
The gun was on the table.

748
00:58:08,718 --> 00:58:10,549
Ken: Yeah? Well, there are
a half dozen cops who say

749
00:58:10,587 --> 00:58:12,646
that Schaefer was making
a threatening gesture with it.

750
00:58:12,689 --> 00:58:15,157
Well, they're lying.
They escalated the conflict.

751
00:58:15,191 --> 00:58:17,853
That guy was not the killer.
He could barely tie his own fucking shoes.

752
00:58:17,894 --> 00:58:19,885
Oh, and that makes him innocent?

753
00:58:19,929 --> 00:58:23,023
Elizabeth was 19 years old,
for Christ's sakes.

754
00:58:23,066 --> 00:58:25,830
And do you know what he called her?
Beth.

755
00:58:25,869 --> 00:58:27,427
No one even called her Elizabeth.

756
00:58:27,470 --> 00:58:30,837
Meg. Meg.
The DNA tests came back.

757
00:58:30,874 --> 00:58:33,809
The cat hair that was in his house
was a positive match.

758
00:58:33,843 --> 00:58:35,743
It was positive.

759
00:58:35,778 --> 00:58:37,609
That doesn't make sense.

760
00:58:37,647 --> 00:58:41,083
The gun was on the table, Ken.
That's the truth.

761
00:58:41,117 --> 00:58:43,449
Listen, Len Schaefer kept that girl

762
00:58:43,486 --> 00:58:45,886
hostage for two hours at gunpoint.

763
00:58:45,922 --> 00:58:48,117
He was ranting and dangerous.

764
00:58:48,157 --> 00:58:50,990
The cop who fired saw
an opening and took it.

765
00:58:51,027 --> 00:58:53,393
I'd have done the same thing.
So would you.

766
00:58:53,429 --> 00:58:57,297
It was a righteous shooting, okay?

767
00:58:57,333 --> 00:59:00,598
Now you want to contest
the fine points, go ahead.

768
00:59:00,637 --> 00:59:02,798
You'll lose.

769
00:59:02,839 --> 00:59:06,536
There'll be a hearing into
your conduct in the matter.

770
00:59:06,576 --> 00:59:08,942
Oh yeah.

771
00:59:08,978 --> 00:59:11,208
And the board will find
that you were delusional,

772
00:59:11,247 --> 00:59:13,238
that you disobeyed an order

773
00:59:13,283 --> 00:59:14,978
and you endangered lives.

774
00:59:17,287 --> 00:59:19,585
And you'll be fired

775
00:59:19,622 --> 00:59:21,715
and I'll be censured

776
00:59:21,758 --> 00:59:24,784
and most likely demoted
for putting you on the case.

777
00:59:27,030 --> 00:59:30,898
This whole thing has been
embarrassing enough, Megan.

778
00:59:34,904 --> 00:59:37,134
But it makes no sense.

779
00:59:37,173 --> 00:59:39,767
Do you know what everyone calls her?

780
00:59:42,245 --> 00:59:44,372
Beth.

781
00:59:44,414 --> 00:59:46,541
You told me that already.

782
00:59:51,788 --> 00:59:53,881
Now where was the gun, Meg?

783
00:59:57,594 --> 00:59:58,856
Norcross on TV:
Good evening.

784
00:59:58,895 --> 01:00:01,921
We believe that the man who the press
labeled as the Alphabet Killer

785
01:00:01,965 --> 01:00:03,956
was shot and killed this evening.

786
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:06,628
Suspect's name was Len Schaefer.

787
01:00:06,669 --> 01:00:08,796
He was an employee of
the Webster Fire Department.

788
01:00:08,838 --> 01:00:11,898
He may have been using
a fireman's uniform

789
01:00:11,941 --> 01:00:14,535
to lure his victims into his vehicle.

790
01:00:14,577 --> 01:00:16,875
When the police arrived
on the scene this evening

791
01:00:16,913 --> 01:00:18,972
he was holding
a young lady at gunpoint,

792
01:00:19,015 --> 01:00:22,109
a young lady who had
double initials in her name.

793
01:00:22,151 --> 01:00:24,381
Suspect was allegedly trying

794
01:00:24,420 --> 01:00:26,388
to rape the young lady
when the police intervened.

795
01:00:26,422 --> 01:00:29,755
He brandished a weapon at the officers.

796
01:00:29,792 --> 01:00:32,260
The officers shot and killed him.

797
01:00:32,295 --> 01:00:35,230
The young lady suffered no injuries.

798
01:00:35,264 --> 01:00:36,959
She's recovering well.

799
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:39,867
We're still gathering evidence,
but I think it's safe to say

800
01:00:39,902 --> 01:00:43,565
that this dark chapter in our community's
history is coming to an end.

801
01:00:43,606 --> 01:00:45,403
Are there any questions?

802
01:00:54,250 --> 01:00:56,377
Oh!

803
01:01:00,056 --> 01:01:01,580
I wanted to catch you
before you left.

804
01:01:01,624 --> 01:01:03,455
- Mmm.
- You okay?

805
01:01:05,628 --> 01:01:07,926
Hey, Megan...

806
01:01:07,964 --> 01:01:11,058
I wanted to say it was actually

807
01:01:11,100 --> 01:01:13,466
nice working with you.

808
01:01:13,503 --> 01:01:15,733
I'm sorry it ended this way.

809
01:01:15,772 --> 01:01:17,933
No, it's all right.

810
01:01:17,974 --> 01:01:20,841
I've still got my job
in the records department.

811
01:01:20,877 --> 01:01:22,742
For now.

812
01:01:26,783 --> 01:01:29,445
You don't think Len Schaefer
committed those murders, do you?

813
01:01:32,121 --> 01:01:35,557
I don't know.
It's certainly not the way I imagined it.

814
01:01:35,591 --> 01:01:37,821
Are you still on the case?

815
01:01:37,860 --> 01:01:40,727
Another week or two
to close the files.

816
01:01:42,398 --> 01:01:43,888
It's been a tough one, Meg.

817
01:02:07,090 --> 01:02:09,024
Did you mean that?

818
01:02:10,993 --> 01:02:13,461
Sorry.
No.

819
01:02:13,496 --> 01:02:15,521
I don't think so.

820
01:02:15,565 --> 01:02:18,728
- I'm... I'm just really...
- It's okay. It's okay.

821
01:02:20,203 --> 01:02:22,433
No need to explain.

822
01:02:22,472 --> 01:02:24,633
I'll see you soon.

823
01:03:52,795 --> 01:03:54,786
Megan: I just have a few questions
about the abduction

824
01:03:54,831 --> 01:03:56,924
so that I could tie up
some loose ends.

825
01:03:56,966 --> 01:04:00,060
You know, I'm surprised
you're still on the job.

826
01:04:00,102 --> 01:04:03,037
But of course we'll share
any information we have.

827
01:04:03,072 --> 01:04:06,041
Now that you got the collar.

828
01:04:06,075 --> 01:04:08,270
That's correct.

829
01:04:09,946 --> 01:04:13,143
Um, when did you know

830
01:04:13,182 --> 01:04:15,912
that the Alphabet Killer
was Len Schaefer?

831
01:04:18,254 --> 01:04:21,849
He assaulted a young girl,
a young girl with double initials.

832
01:04:21,891 --> 01:04:24,416
The color of his personal car matched.

833
01:04:24,460 --> 01:04:28,260
And when the tests from the cat hair
came back positive

834
01:04:28,297 --> 01:04:31,698
we were pretty sure that confirmed it.

835
01:04:31,734 --> 01:04:35,067
Your men found the cat hair
when they searched Len's house?

836
01:04:36,505 --> 01:04:39,668
First the car then the house, yes.

837
01:04:39,709 --> 01:04:42,576
Mmm, I saw some as well.

838
01:04:42,612 --> 01:04:44,273
The cat hair.

839
01:04:52,722 --> 01:04:55,156
You've been back to the crime scene.

840
01:04:56,492 --> 01:04:58,824
Now isn't that interesting?

841
01:04:58,861 --> 01:05:01,261
Who gave you permission?

842
01:05:01,297 --> 01:05:04,994
The cat hair was only on one chair.

843
01:05:08,337 --> 01:05:10,271
Probably his favorite.

844
01:05:10,306 --> 01:05:13,901
Mmm. You know there was
something very strange though.

845
01:05:13,943 --> 01:05:16,173
- And what was that?
- There was no cat food in the house.

846
01:05:16,212 --> 01:05:18,578
There was no litter either.

847
01:05:19,949 --> 01:05:22,076
Well, he probably crapped outside.

848
01:05:22,118 --> 01:05:24,882
- What did he eat?
- Mice.

849
01:05:24,921 --> 01:05:26,718
He ate mice.

850
01:05:26,756 --> 01:05:28,189
I think that you planted that evidence.

851
01:05:28,224 --> 01:05:29,657
I think that you planted that cat fur.

852
01:05:31,994 --> 01:05:35,828
You get the fuck out of my office
right now.

853
01:05:35,865 --> 01:05:37,127
Why did you do it?

854
01:05:37,166 --> 01:05:39,930
Did you plant the evidence to ensure
Schaefer's conviction?

855
01:05:39,969 --> 01:05:41,960
Or where you covering something up?

856
01:05:42,004 --> 01:05:44,564
I didn't do a goddamn thing.

857
01:05:46,709 --> 01:05:48,506
But let me tell you something:

858
01:05:48,544 --> 01:05:51,513
If someone did, in theory,
do something

859
01:05:51,547 --> 01:05:55,449
to protect the public,
to close the book on a wretched killer,

860
01:05:55,484 --> 01:05:58,214
even if it was against the rules,
then I'd have to say

861
01:05:58,254 --> 01:06:01,451
this person did the right thing.

862
01:06:04,961 --> 01:06:08,328
Unless this person had the wrong guy

863
01:06:08,364 --> 01:06:11,663
and children continue to die.

864
01:06:17,473 --> 01:06:19,737
You know, I heard you were crazy.

865
01:06:23,512 --> 01:06:25,207
Now you go on now.

866
01:06:26,515 --> 01:06:27,982
Get out.

867
01:06:29,185 --> 01:06:31,119
Get out.

868
01:06:32,488 --> 01:06:35,787
Help us, Megan.

869
01:06:48,571 --> 01:06:50,664
Hey, you're that policewoman.

870
01:06:50,706 --> 01:06:52,697
Yeah.

871
01:06:52,742 --> 01:06:55,040
You're the bartender from Richmond's.

872
01:06:55,077 --> 01:06:56,704
Yeah, Hank.

873
01:06:56,746 --> 01:06:58,475
Good memory.

874
01:06:58,514 --> 01:07:02,075
You came in and spoke with Jay Castillo
a few times a couple years ago.

875
01:07:02,118 --> 01:07:03,881
Carla Castillo's father.

876
01:07:03,919 --> 01:07:05,887
That's right.
How's he doing?

877
01:07:05,921 --> 01:07:08,389
He stopped drinking.
It's a start.

878
01:07:08,424 --> 01:07:10,449
So you don't see
much of his anymore?

879
01:07:10,493 --> 01:07:12,688
Oh, I see him all the time.
We're neighbors.

880
01:07:12,728 --> 01:07:14,218
Did you know Carla?

881
01:07:14,263 --> 01:07:17,721
Yeah, nice kid.

882
01:07:19,068 --> 01:07:22,834
Did you notice anything different
about her before she was killed?

883
01:07:24,206 --> 01:07:25,764
No.

884
01:07:25,808 --> 01:07:27,935
Well, I didn't see much of her then.

885
01:07:27,977 --> 01:07:30,537
She stopped coming around
about six months earlier.

886
01:07:30,579 --> 01:07:33,173
What are you talking about?

887
01:07:33,215 --> 01:07:35,513
You didn't know?

888
01:07:35,551 --> 01:07:37,610
They had a big fight.

889
01:07:37,653 --> 01:07:40,679
Jay's drinking got pretty bad
at that point.

890
01:07:42,358 --> 01:07:44,986
- Listen, take care.
- Yeah, sure.

891
01:08:53,629 --> 01:08:56,257
Where'd Carla go
on Tuesday afternoons?

892
01:09:01,570 --> 01:09:04,038
It's been a long time.

893
01:09:04,073 --> 01:09:05,700
About two years.

894
01:09:05,741 --> 01:09:07,641
Why'd you lie, Jay?

895
01:09:11,747 --> 01:09:14,045
I was a shit father.

896
01:09:15,851 --> 01:09:18,115
I wasn't fit to take care of her,

897
01:09:18,154 --> 01:09:21,055
not even for a few hours.

898
01:09:24,994 --> 01:09:28,452
One night I got drunk...

899
01:09:32,368 --> 01:09:34,131
and I yelled at her.

900
01:09:35,671 --> 01:09:37,730
So bad...

901
01:09:40,809 --> 01:09:43,277
I had her go with
her grandmother after that.

902
01:09:44,647 --> 01:09:46,274
For how long?

903
01:09:46,315 --> 01:09:48,783
Six months or so.

904
01:09:49,785 --> 01:09:51,980
Why would your wife disapprove?

905
01:09:55,491 --> 01:09:57,482
My mother, she's...

906
01:09:57,526 --> 01:09:59,585
she's very Catholic.

907
01:09:59,628 --> 01:10:01,926
She gave Carla that necklace.

908
01:10:01,964 --> 01:10:03,864
And if my wife...

909
01:10:03,899 --> 01:10:05,560
Where did your mother
take her on Tuesdays?

910
01:10:05,601 --> 01:10:08,126
St. Michael's.

911
01:10:08,170 --> 01:10:10,764
A church in Rochester.

912
01:10:13,742 --> 01:10:15,903
- Ken: Megan.
- I found a connection.

913
01:10:15,945 --> 01:10:19,142
Carla went to St. Michael's on Tuesdays,
not her father's.

914
01:10:19,181 --> 01:10:21,672
Megan, you are in a world of shit.

915
01:10:21,717 --> 01:10:24,083
Norcross called me screaming
his head off about you.

916
01:10:24,119 --> 01:10:26,679
Ken. Ken, St. Michael's
is the connection.

917
01:10:26,722 --> 01:10:29,520
All three girls went there.
I'm going there right now.

918
01:10:29,558 --> 01:10:31,753
No, you are not.
You're coming in right now

919
01:10:31,794 --> 01:10:35,457
or I swear to God, I'm gonna send
a patrol car to that church to freakin'...

920
01:11:06,595 --> 01:11:08,722
Man: Now does your whole family
come to church

921
01:11:08,764 --> 01:11:10,857
or is it just you and your mom?

922
01:11:13,936 --> 01:11:15,995
Your dad too?

923
01:11:53,809 --> 01:11:55,834
Aren't you tired?

924
01:11:58,180 --> 01:12:00,580
No, it's not.

925
01:12:02,751 --> 01:12:04,844
No, she'd like to give you a kiss.

926
01:12:04,887 --> 01:12:07,048
It's true.

927
01:12:07,089 --> 01:12:09,114
So next year
you're gonna be in the choir.

928
01:12:09,158 --> 01:12:10,648
Yes.

929
01:12:10,693 --> 01:12:12,684
Why don't you go over there?

930
01:12:18,734 --> 01:12:20,463
My name is Megan Paige.

931
01:12:20,502 --> 01:12:23,471
I'm a detective with the Rochester
Police Department.

932
01:12:23,505 --> 01:12:25,769
I'm gonna need some information.

933
01:12:28,077 --> 01:12:29,840
Do you have any...?

934
01:12:33,549 --> 01:12:35,312
I need to talk to you.

935
01:12:37,619 --> 01:12:39,610
Of course.
This way.

936
01:12:48,497 --> 01:12:50,089
And I'm gonna need a list

937
01:12:50,132 --> 01:12:51,599
of everyone who's been involved

938
01:12:51,633 --> 01:12:54,295
in this church in the last five years...

939
01:12:54,336 --> 01:12:57,772
priests, parishioners, janitors,

940
01:12:57,806 --> 01:12:59,967
whoever else I'm not thinking of.

941
01:13:01,143 --> 01:13:03,111
You know the church

942
01:13:03,145 --> 01:13:05,079
will help the police
in any way we can,

943
01:13:05,114 --> 01:13:07,776
but I can't provide you with information
about our parishioners

944
01:13:07,816 --> 01:13:09,283
without permission.

945
01:13:09,318 --> 01:13:11,786
Can you call someone
and get that permission?

946
01:13:11,820 --> 01:13:13,617
I can try.

947
01:13:23,899 --> 01:13:26,367
Help, Megan.

948
01:13:27,703 --> 01:13:29,193
This is the place.

949
01:13:33,542 --> 01:13:35,635
Books.

950
01:13:42,551 --> 01:13:44,485
Do you pray for the girls?

951
01:13:44,520 --> 01:13:46,681
Excuse me?

952
01:13:46,722 --> 01:13:50,021
Do you pray for the angels
who were called back to heaven?

953
01:13:51,794 --> 01:13:54,592
Yes, I guess so.

954
01:13:57,466 --> 01:13:59,093
That's good.

955
01:14:11,780 --> 01:14:13,714
What the hell is this?

956
01:14:13,749 --> 01:14:15,740
They were our own angels.

957
01:14:21,123 --> 01:14:23,318
What is wrong with you?

958
01:14:24,393 --> 01:14:27,123
And what is that goddamn music?

959
01:14:28,764 --> 01:14:31,130
There's no music.

960
01:14:36,772 --> 01:14:39,741
- What? Fuck.
- Oh no.

961
01:14:39,775 --> 01:14:42,141
- Oh! Oh no.
- Fuck.

962
01:14:42,177 --> 01:14:43,804
- No, please.
- Who is this fuck?

963
01:14:43,846 --> 01:14:45,973
- Oh, please.
- What? God.

964
01:14:46,014 --> 01:14:48,539
God!

965
01:14:49,918 --> 01:14:52,011
No no no no no.

966
01:14:52,054 --> 01:14:54,181
I can hear you.
I can hear you.

967
01:14:57,192 --> 01:14:59,660
I can hear you!

968
01:14:59,695 --> 01:15:01,788
I know!

969
01:15:01,830 --> 01:15:04,492
But where?

970
01:15:17,079 --> 01:15:18,944
God!

971
01:15:39,167 --> 01:15:41,192
I can't take it.

972
01:15:46,208 --> 01:15:48,301
Megan!

973
01:16:45,567 --> 01:16:47,558
Wow.

974
01:16:47,603 --> 01:16:50,037
Déjà vu.

975
01:16:50,072 --> 01:16:52,563
Megan.

976
01:16:52,608 --> 01:16:54,439
How are you feeling?

977
01:16:57,045 --> 01:16:58,842
My head hurts.

978
01:17:04,119 --> 01:17:06,587
Was Captain Shine here?

979
01:17:06,622 --> 01:17:09,113
He left about five minutes ago.

980
01:17:10,792 --> 01:17:13,556
Shit.
I have to talk to him.

981
01:17:13,595 --> 01:17:15,563
He'll be back.

982
01:17:15,597 --> 01:17:17,895
Not good enough.

983
01:17:17,933 --> 01:17:20,561
Hold on, Meg.
You shouldn't leave.

984
01:17:20,602 --> 01:17:23,628
It's not what you need right now.

985
01:17:23,672 --> 01:17:26,641
Shouldn't leave or can't leave?

986
01:17:26,675 --> 01:17:29,542
Do you have a court order?

987
01:17:29,578 --> 01:17:31,307
We do.

988
01:17:31,346 --> 01:17:34,247
We have 14 days to observe you.

989
01:17:34,282 --> 01:17:36,716
But the point is we all want
what's best for you.

990
01:17:36,752 --> 01:17:38,413
We're all in this together.

991
01:17:41,423 --> 01:17:43,357
Did you put me on Thorazine?

992
01:17:43,392 --> 01:17:46,156
You were having a violent
episode when you arrived.

993
01:17:46,194 --> 01:17:49,493
- It's just to give you some clarity.
- Fuck that.

994
01:17:49,531 --> 01:17:51,158
Meg.

995
01:17:52,567 --> 01:17:54,933
Nurse, send Alex in here, please.

996
01:17:54,970 --> 01:17:56,938
Megan.

997
01:17:56,972 --> 01:17:58,564
You're delusional.

998
01:17:58,607 --> 01:18:01,201
It's the disease that makes
you want to do this.

999
01:18:01,243 --> 01:18:03,643
I'm a detective, Dr. Parks.
I have a case to solve.

1000
01:18:03,679 --> 01:18:07,080
You're not a detective, Meg.
You were a detective.

1001
01:18:07,115 --> 01:18:08,707
You're sick now.

1002
01:18:08,750 --> 01:18:10,650
I'm warning you, Dr. Parks,

1003
01:18:10,686 --> 01:18:13,712
do not impede this investigation.

1004
01:18:13,755 --> 01:18:16,417
You remember when you wanted
to kill yourself?

1005
01:18:17,492 --> 01:18:19,585
This is the same thing.

1006
01:18:19,628 --> 01:18:21,619
It's your sickness, Meg.

1007
01:18:21,663 --> 01:18:24,757
Megan. Meg.

1008
01:18:27,869 --> 01:18:30,804
Meg, let's just calm down

1009
01:18:30,839 --> 01:18:33,399
and think about what's best.

1010
01:18:33,442 --> 01:18:35,171
What do you want me to do?

1011
01:18:35,210 --> 01:18:36,905
Let her think.

1012
01:18:38,780 --> 01:18:40,771
Wait wait, Alex.
Wait. No!

1013
01:18:40,816 --> 01:18:43,216
Down. Down. Down.

1014
01:18:43,251 --> 01:18:45,242
Easy. Easy. Easy.

1015
01:18:50,759 --> 01:18:53,387
You follow me out
and I will break your other arm.

1016
01:18:53,428 --> 01:18:56,420
Dr. Park, you're a nice man

1017
01:18:56,465 --> 01:18:59,161
and I will not hit you
unless you come out of this room

1018
01:18:59,201 --> 01:19:00,998
before I'm gone.

1019
01:19:41,109 --> 01:19:43,236
They've got my house staked out.

1020
01:19:43,278 --> 01:19:44,711
They aren't messing around.

1021
01:19:44,746 --> 01:19:48,204
Well, listen, you can stay here
as long as you can stand the company.

1022
01:19:48,250 --> 01:19:50,650
Have you got a plan?

1023
01:19:50,685 --> 01:19:53,586
I'm gonna break into that church
and find their records.

1024
01:19:53,622 --> 01:19:55,886
Oh, Megan, I don't think
you're in any shape for that.

1025
01:19:55,924 --> 01:19:58,154
I feel okay.
I just need a nap.

1026
01:19:58,193 --> 01:20:01,959
Maybe it's the Thorazine,
but I can still tell what's real.

1027
01:20:01,997 --> 01:20:04,488
The pictures on the wall were real.

1028
01:20:06,134 --> 01:20:08,659
Don't you think the police
will be looking into the church

1029
01:20:08,703 --> 01:20:10,694
now that you've established a link?

1030
01:20:10,739 --> 01:20:12,297
Who knows?

1031
01:20:12,340 --> 01:20:16,470
They've found a way to botch
every other aspect of this investigation.

1032
01:20:16,511 --> 01:20:18,240
Maybe they're planning on giving

1033
01:20:18,280 --> 01:20:20,646
that creepy fucking priest
the keys to the city.

1034
01:20:26,121 --> 01:20:28,351
I sound like a lunatic.

1035
01:20:29,357 --> 01:20:31,621
No, you just need to get
a little sleep.

1036
01:21:30,085 --> 01:21:31,848
Richard?

1037
01:23:15,790 --> 01:23:17,985
You're up.

1038
01:23:21,496 --> 01:23:23,327
Richard.

1039
01:23:27,168 --> 01:23:28,999
What are you doing in here?

1040
01:23:34,642 --> 01:23:37,440
Why didn't you tell me
you knew the victims?

1041
01:23:45,987 --> 01:23:48,478
Because...

1042
01:23:50,291 --> 01:23:52,816
then you would know I killed them.

1043
01:24:28,263 --> 01:24:30,788
Richard:
Oh, you're awake.

1044
01:24:30,832 --> 01:24:32,857
I hope I didn't hit you too hard.

1045
01:24:34,235 --> 01:24:36,795
You know, I love you, Megan.

1046
01:24:36,838 --> 01:24:39,773
I really do. But don't worry.
You're not my type.

1047
01:24:39,808 --> 01:24:42,834
Your virtue is safe with me.

1048
01:24:44,079 --> 01:24:46,547
The first one, Carla,

1049
01:24:46,581 --> 01:24:48,139
well, I did that because...

1050
01:24:48,183 --> 01:24:50,947
I don't know why I did it, actually.
I guess 'cause I wanted to.

1051
01:24:50,985 --> 01:24:54,716
But I didn't even realize
I was taking her to Churchville.

1052
01:24:54,756 --> 01:24:56,815
Isn't that ironic?

1053
01:24:56,858 --> 01:24:59,156
You know, when I first met you

1054
01:24:59,194 --> 01:25:01,185
you told me about
your obsession with initials.

1055
01:25:01,229 --> 01:25:04,630
Well, I was just trying to help
you get your job back,

1056
01:25:04,666 --> 01:25:06,964
you know, just trying to make you right.
Don't you see?

1057
01:25:07,001 --> 01:25:10,459
I just thought in that way you and I would
be more connected with each other.

1058
01:25:10,505 --> 01:25:12,530
Yeah.

1059
01:25:17,212 --> 01:25:19,271
Okay.

1060
01:25:31,993 --> 01:25:34,325
You all right?

1061
01:25:34,362 --> 01:25:35,920
Yeah.

1062
01:25:35,964 --> 01:25:39,422
You're my only friend, Megan.
It's gonna be awful losing you.

1063
01:26:07,695 --> 01:26:11,131
Stay calm.
We're only going a few blocks.

1064
01:26:53,875 --> 01:26:57,242
All right, there there.
There there, my love.

1065
01:27:00,281 --> 01:27:03,307
Now I'm gonna put you to sleep.

1066
01:27:03,351 --> 01:27:06,081
You're gonna have a little fall

1067
01:27:06,120 --> 01:27:09,453
and then you're gonna float
on down the Genesee.

1068
01:27:15,697 --> 01:27:17,995
Doesn't that sound nice?

1069
01:28:25,400 --> 01:28:26,867
You bitch.

1070
01:29:05,840 --> 01:29:08,934
Help me.
I don't know where I am.

1071
01:29:20,021 --> 01:29:22,012
Where is he?

1072
01:30:07,402 --> 01:30:10,894
Park: She's delusional and violent,
resistant to treatment.

1073
01:30:10,938 --> 01:30:13,930
She's determined
to fight her way out again.

1074
01:30:16,277 --> 01:30:17,869
This is all my fault.

1075
01:30:17,912 --> 01:30:20,403
Her illness is nobody's fault.

1076
01:30:21,849 --> 01:30:24,340
I was hoping I could talk to her.

1077
01:30:26,254 --> 01:30:28,154
She's unable to communicate.

1078
01:30:28,189 --> 01:30:30,749
She's very heavily medicated.

1079
01:30:33,594 --> 01:30:37,121
We had to put her in the quiet room.

1080
01:31:38,626 --> 01:31:40,992
The body of Christ.

1081
01:31:42,730 --> 01:31:44,561
The body of Christ.

1082
01:31:45,700 --> 01:31:48,100
The body of Christ.

1083
01:31:51,672 --> 01:31:53,663
The body of Christ.

1084
01:31:56,911 --> 01:31:58,503
The body of Christ.

1085
01:31:58,546 --> 01:32:00,275
Amen.

1086
01:32:04,552 --> 01:32:06,247
The body of Christ.

1087
01:32:21,602 --> 01:32:23,467
Amen.

1088
01:32:28,509 --> 01:32:30,374
The body of Christ.

1089
01:32:36,484 --> 01:32:38,349
Girl's voice:
Megan.

1090
01:32:38,386 --> 01:32:40,411
Get out. Help us.

1091
01:33:29,904 --> 01:33:31,929
Megan's voice:
Every day I'm in here

1092
01:33:31,973 --> 01:33:34,703
is a day he's out there.

1093
01:33:34,742 --> 01:33:37,575
My only remaining purpose

1094
01:33:37,612 --> 01:33:39,477
is to get out.

1095
01:33:41,048 --> 01:33:43,778
The dead have given me
their answers.

1096
01:33:43,818 --> 01:33:46,787
And the dead
won't let me forget them.

1097
01:33:46,821 --> 01:33:49,187
I will get out.

1098
01:33:49,223 --> 01:33:51,885
And I will kill him.
