00:21:41,990 --> 00:21:43,681
Hey, whoa, this way.

580
00:21:43,716 --> 00:21:44,475
A short cut.

581
00:21:44,510 --> 00:21:46,132
Very spooky, I think you'll

582
00:21:46,166 --> 00:21:47,651
like it.

583
00:21:47,685 --> 00:21:49,100
[laughing]

584
00:21:49,135 --> 00:21:50,170
That's really funny.

585
00:21:50,205 --> 00:21:51,240
Oh, I'll tell ya, it's nice

586
00:21:51,275 --> 00:21:52,103
to see you smile.

587
00:21:52,138 --> 00:21:53,346
I was getting a little worried.

588
00:21:53,381 --> 00:21:54,416
[gasping]

589
00:21:54,451 --> 00:21:55,175
[pistol cocking]

590
00:21:55,210 --> 00:21:56,522
[gasping]

591
00:21:56,556 --> 00:21:58,869
Don't be a hero.

592
00:21:58,903 --> 00:21:59,870
[Justine groaning]

593
00:21:59,904 --> 00:22:01,699
You're very kind.

594
00:22:01,734 --> 00:22:02,942
Thank you.

595
00:22:02,976 --> 00:22:03,667
You'll have to start

596
00:22:03,701 --> 00:22:05,358
doing more.

597
00:22:05,393 --> 00:22:07,326
I will?

598
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:09,120
Yes.

599
00:22:09,155 --> 00:22:11,778
Give me Tuesdays and Thursdays,

600
00:22:11,813 --> 00:22:14,022
and half of Wednesday?

601
00:22:14,056 --> 00:22:15,057
Half days Tuesdays,

602
00:22:15,092 --> 00:22:16,542
Wednesdays, Thursdays.

603
00:22:16,576 --> 00:22:17,301
Friday's are mine.

604
00:22:17,336 --> 00:22:19,165
[sighing] Fine.

605
00:22:19,199 --> 00:22:20,511
Tying my hands.

606
00:22:20,546 --> 00:22:22,824
[knocking at door]

607
00:22:22,858 --> 00:22:24,860
Wait, let me get it.

608
00:22:29,002 --> 00:22:31,453
Unh!

609
00:22:31,488 --> 00:22:32,661
What do you think you're do--

610
00:22:32,696 --> 00:22:33,973
Oh!

611
00:22:34,007 --> 00:22:34,629
Justine!

612
00:22:34,663 --> 00:22:35,319
Get over there.

613
00:22:35,354 --> 00:22:37,217
Get down!

614
00:22:37,252 --> 00:22:37,873
Get down, all of you.

615
00:22:37,908 --> 00:22:39,703
Stay down. Stay down!

616
00:22:39,737 --> 00:22:41,083
Kenny, tie 'em as fast

617
00:22:41,118 --> 00:22:41,808
as you can.

618
00:22:41,843 --> 00:22:43,051
[women whimpering]

619
00:22:43,085 --> 00:22:47,711
[Susan] No!

620
00:22:47,745 --> 00:22:49,747
[Kenny] Stay still, lady.

621
00:22:59,861 --> 00:23:02,173
Kenny, not the kid.

622
00:23:02,208 --> 00:23:03,485
Focus!

623
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:05,487
Gag her.

624
00:23:12,598 --> 00:23:13,737
All right, get up.

625
00:23:13,771 --> 00:23:17,465
Let's go, do it, move out.

626
00:23:17,499 --> 00:23:18,293
Kenny!

627
00:23:18,327 --> 00:23:18,949
Cover the rear.

628
00:23:18,983 --> 00:23:19,777
Move it out, now!

629
00:23:19,812 --> 00:23:21,503
[whimpering]

630
00:23:33,688 --> 00:23:35,897
Move it, move it, move it!

631
00:23:35,931 --> 00:23:36,932
Come on!

632
00:23:45,596 --> 00:23:48,150
Hurry up, you cow.

633
00:23:54,812 --> 00:23:58,367
Come on, step on it.

634
00:23:58,402 --> 00:23:59,161
No!

635
00:23:59,196 --> 00:24:01,336
Shut up!

636
00:24:05,236 --> 00:24:05,858
Sit down.

637
00:24:05,892 --> 00:24:06,514
[both] Oh!

638
00:24:06,548 --> 00:24:08,481
Shut up!

639
00:24:08,516 --> 00:24:09,655
Tie the chickens up, Kenny.

640
00:24:09,689 --> 00:24:12,312
Keep 'em in the coop.

641
00:24:12,347 --> 00:24:14,245
I said tie 'em.

642
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:15,281
We-- well, why do we have to

643
00:24:15,315 --> 00:24:16,075
tie 'em?

644
00:24:16,109 --> 00:24:19,181
I mean, where are they going?

645
00:24:19,216 --> 00:24:20,079
You want to wind up back on

646
00:24:20,113 --> 00:24:21,011
the street?

647
00:24:21,045 --> 00:24:24,877
Nowhere to go?

648
00:24:24,911 --> 00:24:29,744
Then tie 'em.

649
00:24:29,778 --> 00:24:31,746
What do you want with us?

650
00:24:31,780 --> 00:24:33,299
You keep your flap shut.

651
00:24:33,333 --> 00:24:34,645
Speak when spoken to.

652
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:35,681
Cong don't let them take their

653
00:24:35,715 --> 00:24:37,890
home, they fight.

654
00:24:37,924 --> 00:24:41,065
When are we going to Mexico?

655
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:43,654
Soon, Kenny, soon.

656
00:24:43,689 --> 00:24:44,759
But when I tell you to do

657
00:24:44,793 --> 00:24:46,519
something, don't ever

658
00:24:46,554 --> 00:24:48,659
question me.

659
00:24:48,694 --> 00:24:51,179
Now tie 'em.

660
00:24:51,213 --> 00:24:55,424
It's payday.

661
00:24:55,459 --> 00:24:57,565
What--

662
00:24:57,599 --> 00:24:59,221
Son of a--

663
00:24:59,256 --> 00:25:00,844
What's wrong?

664
00:25:00,878 --> 00:25:01,983
We've been double-crossed.

665
00:25:02,017 --> 00:25:03,294
Oh, may-- may-- maybe we

666
00:25:03,329 --> 00:25:05,365
should go now.

667
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:06,746
You stay here.

668
00:25:06,781 --> 00:25:08,023
You gonna kill somebody?

669
00:25:08,058 --> 00:25:09,749
Not just somebody.

670
00:25:13,788 --> 00:25:14,478
Because when I was a little

671
00:25:14,513 --> 00:25:16,791
boy, my grandfather brought me

672
00:25:16,825 --> 00:25:18,551
to this hotel.

673
00:25:18,586 --> 00:25:19,759
And it became a little tradition

674
00:25:19,794 --> 00:25:20,519
for us.

675
00:25:20,553 --> 00:25:21,934
Uh, right after church, almost

676
00:25:21,968 --> 00:25:23,832
every Sunday, we would come here

677
00:25:23,867 --> 00:25:25,351
and we would spend a few hours

678
00:25:25,385 --> 00:25:27,767
with the finest cuisine and

679
00:25:27,802 --> 00:25:29,631
conversation.

680
00:25:29,666 --> 00:25:30,321
Now on a more personal note...

681
00:25:30,356 --> 00:25:31,115
Base to ballroom, all

682
00:25:31,150 --> 00:25:32,289
sectors clear.

683
00:25:32,323 --> 00:25:33,566
Let me just say that this is

684
00:25:33,601 --> 00:25:35,499
a lot more than just politics

685
00:25:35,534 --> 00:25:36,224
to me.

686
00:25:36,258 --> 00:25:37,536
It's about a lot more than just

687
00:25:37,570 --> 00:25:39,365
trying to get your votes--

688
00:25:39,399 --> 00:25:40,297

[muffled speech continues]

691
00:26:08,843 --> 00:26:10,603
I learned a great deal from

692
00:26:10,638 --> 00:26:12,294
those wonderful afternoons here

693
00:26:12,329 --> 00:26:14,883
on Sunday with my grandfather.

694
00:26:14,918 --> 00:26:16,816
And I plan to return here with

695
00:26:16,851 --> 00:26:19,923
my daughter to see this place

696
00:26:19,957 --> 00:26:21,372
as it should be.

697
00:26:21,407 --> 00:26:22,201
[applause]

698
00:26:22,235 --> 00:26:27,033

00:27:01,689 --> 00:27:04,243
Hey, did you hear that?

703
00:27:04,277 --> 00:27:06,625
Unit Five to base.

704
00:27:06,659 --> 00:27:08,178
Copy, Unit Five.

705
00:27:08,212 --> 00:27:08,972
Yeah, there may be someone in

706
00:27:09,006 --> 00:27:10,594
the off-limits section.

707
00:27:10,629 --> 00:27:12,078
Will investigate and advise.

708
00:27:12,113 --> 00:27:15,047
That's a roger, Unit Five.

709
00:27:15,081 --> 00:27:16,255
Base to ballroom.

710
00:27:16,289 --> 00:27:16,911
Unit Five reports movement...

711
00:27:16,945 --> 00:27:17,670
Thank you.

[beeping]

719
00:27:59,091 --> 00:28:00,057
I remember being with all...

720
00:28:00,092 --> 00:28:01,472
All units, evacuate hotel,

721
00:28:01,507 --> 00:28:02,163
now!

722
00:28:02,197 --> 00:28:02,991
Repeat, evacuate now!

723
00:28:03,026 --> 00:28:04,475
And I remember feeling proud.

724
00:28:04,510 --> 00:28:05,200
Mr. Mayor, we have

725
00:28:05,235 --> 00:28:07,340
a situation.

726
00:28:07,375 --> 00:28:09,757
I was proud to be among them.

727
00:28:09,791 --> 00:28:11,724
And I was proud to know that

728
00:28:11,759 --> 00:28:13,484
I was a-- was a part of

729
00:28:13,519 --> 00:28:14,900
something bigger than myself.

730
00:28:14,934 --> 00:28:17,040
That's really what this

731
00:28:17,074 --> 00:28:17,799
is about.

732
00:28:17,834 --> 00:28:19,594

00:28:24,047 --> 00:28:25,186
Uh, ladies and gentlemen, uh,

735
00:28:25,220 --> 00:28:27,015
please forgive the intrusion.

736
00:28:27,050 --> 00:28:28,707
Unfortunately, the fire marshal

737
00:28:28,741 --> 00:28:29,777
has brought to our attention

738
00:28:29,811 --> 00:28:30,501
that, um...

739
00:28:30,536 --> 00:28:33,815
[beeping]

740
00:28:33,850 --> 00:28:35,472
So please, we are being asked to

741
00:28:35,506 --> 00:28:37,336
move towards the nearest exit,

742
00:28:37,370 --> 00:28:38,440
immediately.

743
00:28:38,475 --> 00:28:39,752
So please, now, move towards

744
00:28:39,787 --> 00:28:41,305
the exits, thank you.

745
00:28:41,340 --> 00:28:42,410
I thought you were the fire

746
00:28:42,444 --> 00:28:43,411
marshal, Frank?

747
00:28:43,445 --> 00:28:44,446
So did I.

748
00:28:44,481 --> 00:28:45,137
I gotta talk to the mayor.

749
00:28:45,171 --> 00:28:46,172
Now, there is no immediate

750
00:28:46,207 --> 00:28:46,897
danger.

751
00:28:46,932 --> 00:28:48,657
Please go calmly.

752
00:28:48,692 --> 00:28:50,211
This is not an emergency, it is

753
00:28:50,245 --> 00:28:54,249
just a precaution.

754
00:28:54,284 --> 00:28:54,905

Okay, I'm gonna break it

763
00:29:14,442 --> 00:29:15,236

I don't understand.

767
00:29:27,075 --> 00:29:28,456
How could this happen?

768
00:29:28,490 --> 00:29:29,215
Excuse me, Congressman, this

769
00:29:29,250 --> 00:29:30,872
is FBI agents Hopkins and Green.

770
00:29:30,907 --> 00:29:31,770
I'm sorry we couldn't meet

771
00:29:31,804 --> 00:29:32,805
under different circumstances,

772
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:33,461
Mr. Sinclair.

773
00:29:33,495 --> 00:29:34,220
This is Captain Waters.

774
00:29:34,255 --> 00:29:35,601
He was here when it happened.

775
00:29:35,635 --> 00:29:37,120
Mr. Hopkins, Miss Green,

776
00:29:37,154 --> 00:29:38,328
I had several of my men posted

777
00:29:38,362 --> 00:29:39,329
here when this went down.

778
00:29:39,363 --> 00:29:39,985
Oh, your people were in

779
00:29:40,019 --> 00:29:40,986
charge of security?

780
00:29:41,020 --> 00:29:41,676
You sound like this was the

781
00:29:41,710 --> 00:29:42,781
city's fault.

782
00:29:42,815 --> 00:29:44,230
Captain, please, bring us up

783
00:29:44,265 --> 00:29:44,886
to speed.

784
00:29:44,921 --> 00:29:45,784
During the speeches, the

785
00:29:45,818 --> 00:29:47,613
family was waiting upstairs.

786
00:29:47,647 --> 00:29:48,890
The terrorists came over a

787
00:29:48,925 --> 00:29:50,409
police band frequency saying

788
00:29:50,443 --> 00:29:52,066
they had kidnapped the wife,

789
00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:53,653
her aide, and the congressman's

790
00:29:53,688 --> 00:29:54,309
daughter.

791
00:29:54,344 --> 00:29:54,965
What?

792
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:55,794
Yeah.

793
00:29:55,828 --> 00:29:56,725
Two of my men responded

794
00:29:56,760 --> 00:29:57,588
upstairs.

795
00:29:57,623 --> 00:29:58,382
They were searching for the

796
00:29:58,417 --> 00:29:59,590
family and the mayor's

797
00:29:59,625 --> 00:30:00,833
assistant, Eric.

798
00:30:00,868 --> 00:30:02,352
Do we know their demands?

799
00:30:02,386 --> 00:30:05,769
So far, find Larry King...

800
00:30:05,804 --> 00:30:06,874
and they want to negotiate

801
00:30:06,908 --> 00:30:08,599
through Charles Duffy.

802
00:30:08,634 --> 00:30:09,704
Duffy's a retired police

803
00:30:09,738 --> 00:30:10,360
officer.

804
00:30:10,394 --> 00:30:11,016
Retired?

805
00:30:11,050 --> 00:30:11,706
Why him?

806
00:30:11,740 --> 00:30:12,638
I have no idea.

807
00:30:12,672 --> 00:30:13,673
Well, if they want this

808
00:30:13,708 --> 00:30:15,020
Duffy, then for heaven's sakes,

809
00:30:15,054 --> 00:30:15,986
let's get them Duffy, I--

810
00:30:16,021 --> 00:30:17,712
Look, okay, Captain, as of

811
00:30:17,746 --> 00:30:19,334
now this is FBI jurisdiction.

812
00:30:19,369 --> 00:30:20,888
Look, I understand federal

813
00:30:20,922 --> 00:30:22,130
jurisdictions, but you're still

814
00:30:22,165 --> 00:30:23,476
going to need my help here.

815
00:30:23,511 --> 00:30:24,477
So why don't you just--

816
00:30:24,512 --> 00:30:25,858
Gentlemen, let's save the

817
00:30:25,893 --> 00:30:26,928
turf warfare, okay?

818
00:30:26,963 --> 00:30:27,895
I'm sure the congressman wants

819
00:30:27,929 --> 00:30:29,103
everybody's help.

820
00:30:29,137 --> 00:30:29,793
All right, here it is,

821
00:30:29,828 --> 00:30:30,449
Captain.

822
00:30:30,483 --> 00:30:31,312
We'll use your men to seal

823
00:30:31,346 --> 00:30:31,968
the perimeter.

824
00:30:32,002 --> 00:30:32,692
Already done.

825
00:30:32,727 --> 00:30:33,417
Good.

826
00:30:33,452 --> 00:30:34,177
Agent Green, I want you to take

827
00:30:34,211 --> 00:30:35,972
Waters and find Charles Duffy.

828
00:30:36,006 --> 00:30:38,595
All my people, out of here!

829
00:30:38,629 --> 00:30:39,838
Okay, it's time for the men

830
00:30:39,872 --> 00:30:41,046
to take over from the boys.

831
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:41,909
Out of my seat.

832
00:30:41,943 --> 00:30:43,117
Yeah, out of his seat.

833
00:30:43,151 --> 00:30:43,980
There you go.

834
00:30:44,014 --> 00:30:44,877
Out you go.

835
00:30:44,912 --> 00:30:49,778
[indistinct radio chatter]

836
00:30:49,813 --> 00:30:50,503
Woodall.

837
00:30:50,538 --> 00:30:51,194
Yes, sir.

838
00:30:51,228 --> 00:30:51,884
I want to meet with all the

839
00:30:51,919 --> 00:30:52,989
assault team squad leaders.

840
00:30:53,023 --> 00:30:54,093
Whoa, whoa, now hey, that

841
00:30:54,128 --> 00:30:54,887
seems awfully dangerous.

842
00:30:54,922 --> 00:30:55,888
Congressman, Congressman,

843
00:30:55,923 --> 00:30:57,131
try to understand, all right?

844
00:30:57,165 --> 00:30:58,235
The more options I have, the

845
00:30:58,270 --> 00:30:59,305
better I can negotiate.

846
00:30:59,340 --> 00:31:00,444
Have you ever heard of agent

847
00:31:00,479 --> 00:31:02,239
John Lipinski?

848
00:31:02,274 --> 00:31:03,068
No.

849
00:31:03,102 --> 00:31:04,207
He was on the protection team

850
00:31:04,241 --> 00:31:05,449
when Reagan got shot.

851
00:31:05,484 --> 00:31:07,175
He's now a parking lot attendant

852
00:31:07,210 --> 00:31:09,177
in Minneapolis.

853
00:31:09,212 --> 00:31:14,148
Understood?

854
00:31:14,182 --> 00:31:15,494
Robert, I'm, uh...

855
00:31:15,528 --> 00:31:16,253
I'm really sorry.

856
00:31:16,288 --> 00:31:17,082
If there's anything I can do...

857
00:31:17,116 --> 00:31:18,255
No, thank-- thank you, Miles.

858
00:31:18,290 --> 00:31:21,017
I appreciate your being here.

859
00:31:21,051 --> 00:31:24,572
[coffee pot clattering]

860
00:31:24,606 --> 00:31:25,745
Have some more coffee,

861
00:31:25,780 --> 00:31:29,335
Charlie.

862
00:31:29,370 --> 00:31:30,267
[sighing]

863
00:31:30,302 --> 00:31:31,096
I'm going to put something in

864
00:31:31,130 --> 00:31:32,200
to give it a little personality.

865
00:31:32,235 --> 00:31:33,961
No, no, you've had enough...

866
00:31:33,995 --> 00:31:34,893
personality.

867
00:31:34,927 --> 00:31:37,688
We need your help, Officer.

868
00:31:37,723 --> 00:31:39,069
Who's she?

869
00:31:39,104 --> 00:31:40,415
For the tenth time, she's

870
00:31:40,450 --> 00:31:42,590
agent Green, FBI detail for

871
00:31:42,624 --> 00:31:45,558
Congressman Sinclair.

872
00:31:45,593 --> 00:31:47,940
I never heard of him.

873
00:31:47,975 --> 00:31:48,734
He's a United States

874
00:31:48,768 --> 00:31:49,528
congressman.

875
00:31:49,562 --> 00:31:50,943
Oh, last time I voted,

876
00:31:50,978 --> 00:31:52,289
I voted for Goldwater.

877
00:31:52,324 --> 00:31:53,946
Get his clothes!

878
00:31:53,981 --> 00:31:56,397
Look, Charlie, try to

879
00:31:56,431 --> 00:31:58,502
understand, we need your help.

880
00:31:58,537 --> 00:31:59,607
People have been kidnapped.

881
00:31:59,641 --> 00:32:00,642
The congressman's wife

882
00:32:00,677 --> 00:32:01,333
and daughter.

883
00:32:01,367 --> 00:32:02,990
Need my help?

884
00:32:03,024 --> 00:32:03,956
For what?

885
00:32:03,991 --> 00:32:04,819
To negotiate.

886
00:32:04,853 --> 00:32:06,855
Charlie, the girl's only 13.

887
00:32:11,377 --> 00:32:12,827
Where do you want me to go?

888
00:32:12,861 --> 00:32:13,724
Get him dressed!

889
00:32:13,759 --> 00:32:15,726
Let's go.

890
00:32:15,761 --> 00:32:17,280
Uh... wait, wait, wait,

891
00:32:17,314 --> 00:32:18,729
wait, wait.

892
00:32:18,764 --> 00:32:21,146
I'll go, fine, happy to.

893
00:32:21,180 --> 00:32:21,974
But I'm not going without

894
00:32:22,009 --> 00:32:24,252
my partner.

895
00:32:24,287 --> 00:32:25,978
I am not going without Logan.

896
00:32:26,013 --> 00:32:26,634
Fine.

897
00:32:26,668 --> 00:32:30,293
Where do we find him?

898
00:32:30,327 --> 00:32:31,535
Is he talking too fast?

899
00:32:31,570 --> 00:32:32,674
You'll like Logan.

900
00:32:32,709 --> 00:32:34,297
He is a cool cat.

901
00:32:34,331 --> 00:32:35,505
Yeah, unless he trusts you

902
00:32:35,539 --> 00:32:36,851
and you let him down.

903
00:32:36,885 --> 00:32:37,921
Trust who?

904
00:32:37,956 --> 00:32:39,233
[both] Charlie!

905
00:32:39,267 --> 00:32:40,337
Big Irishman cost me

906
00:32:40,372 --> 00:32:41,442
90 grand today.

907
00:32:41,476 --> 00:32:42,650
Money seems to come up a lot

908
00:32:42,684 --> 00:32:43,340
with you guys.

909
00:32:43,375 --> 00:32:44,514
Charlie, he tries to keep his

910
00:32:44,548 --> 00:32:46,240
dark side from taking over.

911
00:32:46,274 --> 00:32:46,999
Oh, Logan, I'd like you to

912
00:32:47,034 --> 00:32:48,207
meet Jackie, and Jennifer.

913
00:32:48,242 --> 00:32:49,381
[Jackie] Hi.

914
00:32:49,415 --> 00:32:50,209
Oh, hello.

915
00:32:50,244 --> 00:32:50,899
Hi.

916
00:32:50,934 --> 00:32:51,624
How do you do?

917
00:32:51,659 --> 00:32:53,281
And Rita, the beautiful and

918
00:32:53,316 --> 00:32:54,006
lovely Rita.

919
00:32:54,041 --> 00:32:55,249
She's a graduate.

920
00:32:55,283 --> 00:32:57,078
Oh. Woof.

921
00:32:57,113 --> 00:32:59,287
Hi.

922
00:32:59,322 --> 00:33:00,599
[Higgs] So, Logan, are you

923
00:33:00,633 --> 00:33:01,876
and Charlie ever gonna make some

924
00:33:01,910 --> 00:33:03,291
sort of peace?

925
00:33:03,326 --> 00:33:04,223
I mean, Charlie's not going to

926
00:33:04,258 --> 00:33:05,742
last forever.

927
00:33:05,776 --> 00:33:06,536
Not that I know anything

928
00:33:06,570 --> 00:33:07,192
about it.

929
00:33:07,226 --> 00:33:07,882
[Charlie] You're right,

930
00:33:07,916 --> 00:33:08,538
Higgs.

931
00:33:08,572 --> 00:33:09,194
I am?

932
00:33:09,228 --> 00:33:09,953
Yeah.

933
00:33:09,988 --> 00:33:10,712
You don't know anything

934
00:33:10,747 --> 00:33:13,129
about it... so stay out of it.

935
00:33:13,163 --> 00:33:14,026
[women] Ooh!

936
00:33:14,061 --> 00:33:15,579

946
00:33:30,836 --> 00:33:32,700
No sign, over.

[indistinct radio chatter]

948
00:33:36,117 --> 00:33:38,913
Go!

[indistinct radio chatter]

950
00:33:43,159 --> 00:33:43,849
How many guys are we

951
00:33:43,883 --> 00:33:44,953
looking for?

952
00:33:44,988 --> 00:33:46,990
They didn't say.

953
00:33:51,098 --> 00:33:52,685
Clear.

954
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:55,102
Moving.

955
00:33:55,136 --> 00:33:58,898
Let's go.

Let's go.

960
00:34:04,973 --> 00:34:05,629
Roger that.

961
00:34:05,664 --> 00:34:06,596
So, it's gonna be one, two,

962
00:34:06,630 --> 00:34:08,770
or twenty, maybe?

963
00:34:13,741 --> 00:34:16,813
Let's go.

Alpha 1-1, what was that?

971
00:34:33,864 --> 00:34:37,109
Was that an explosion?

972
00:34:37,144 --> 00:34:38,938
T.O.C., this is Alpha 2-1.

973
00:34:38,973 --> 00:34:39,870
That is affirmative.

But they requested you by name.

You've got two mics and

997
00:35:19,634 --> 00:35:20,532

998
00:35:20,566 --> 00:35:21,671
Yeah, just in case I pee my

1000
00:35:22,913 --> 00:35:23,880
It's a present position

1002
00:35:24,639 --> 00:35:25,640
It allows us to locate you

1003

Yeah, yeah.

These are the hostages,

Officer Duffy.

1013
00:35:40,793 --> 00:35:42,416
This is Susan, the congressman's

1014
00:35:42,450 --> 00:35:44,211
wife.

1015
00:35:44,245 --> 00:35:47,075
This is Ricki, her aide.

1016
00:35:47,110 --> 00:35:48,698
This is Justine, the

1017
00:35:48,732 --> 00:35:51,908
congressman's daughter.

1018

The mayor's aide, assistant,

1019
00:35:53,358 --> 00:35:54,221
we don't have a picture of him.

1020
00:35:54,255 --> 00:35:55,222
We don't know if he's up there

1021
00:35:55,256 --> 00:35:55,981
or not.

1022
00:35:56,015 --> 00:35:56,809
He's ready.

1023
00:35:56,844 --> 00:35:57,638
Thanks.

1024

Listen, Charlie, I want you

1025
00:35:59,157 --> 00:36:01,193
to understand something.

1026
00:36:01,228 --> 00:36:02,677
That's my wife and my daughter

1027
00:36:02,712 --> 00:36:03,851
up there.

1028
00:36:03,885 --> 00:36:04,921
Now, I want you to promise 'em

1029
00:36:04,955 --> 00:36:06,405

they want.

1032
00:36:08,476 --> 00:36:09,236
But don't let 'em hurt

1033
00:36:09,270 --> 00:36:10,271

1034
00:36:10,306 --> 00:36:11,721
I'll try.

1035

Officer Duffy.

1036
00:36:13,412 --> 00:36:14,724
According to their instructions,

1037
00:36:14,758 --> 00:36:15,621
this is the path you'll

1038
00:36:15,656 --> 00:36:16,553
be taking.

1039
00:36:16,588 --> 00:36:18,210
Follow it to the "T."

1040
00:36:18,245 --> 00:36:19,936
Charlie, the terrorists will

1041
00:36:19,970 --> 00:36:20,971
have new instructions waiting

1042
00:36:21,006 --> 00:36:23,284
for you somewhere along the way.

1043
00:36:23,319 --> 00:36:25,079
Proceed carefully.

1044
00:36:25,113 --> 00:36:26,322
The place is completely booby

1045
00:36:26,356 --> 00:36:27,012
trapped.

1046
00:36:27,046 --> 00:36:27,702
I don't suppose anybody has a

1047

1048
00:36:30,153 --> 00:36:32,328
I'm just kidding.

1049
00:36:32,362 --> 00:36:34,295
Take this, Charlie.

1050
00:36:34,330 --> 00:36:38,265
It's time to go.

1051
00:36:38,299 --> 00:36:43,994
Good luck, Duffy.

1052
00:36:44,029 --> 00:36:45,237
No one's heard from Logan,

1053
00:36:45,272 --> 00:36:46,825
Charlie.

1054
00:36:46,859 --> 00:36:48,654
He'll be here.

1152
00:41:39,911 --> 00:41:42,914
Okay, wait, let's talk.

1153
00:41:42,948 --> 00:41:43,880
I can help ya.

1154
00:41:43,915 --> 00:41:45,675
Officer, it's me.

1155
00:41:45,710 --> 00:41:47,435
You remember me.

1156
00:41:47,470 --> 00:41:49,161
Yeah sure, I-- I remember ya.

1157
00:41:49,196 --> 00:41:50,369
Yeah.

1158
00:41:50,404 --> 00:41:51,578
Cops kept hittin' me.

1159
00:41:51,612 --> 00:41:52,786
Chu hoi,I said, chu hoi.

1160
00:41:52,820 --> 00:41:54,028
I surrender.

1161
00:41:54,063 --> 00:41:55,133
Yeah, right.

1162
00:41:55,167 --> 00:41:56,583
Chu hoi,surrender.

1163
00:41:56,617 --> 00:41:57,963
Cops threw me in the hole.

1164
00:41:57,998 --> 00:41:59,240
"Fugazi," baby.

1165
00:41:59,275 --> 00:42:00,656
Completely fugazi.

1166
00:42:00,690 --> 00:42:01,449
Yeah, yeah, that's what

1167
00:42:01,484 --> 00:42:04,142
I thought, fugazi.

1168
00:42:04,176 --> 00:42:05,833
Fugazi, yeah, fugazi.

1169
00:42:05,868 --> 00:42:07,559
Well, you know, you're from

1170
00:42:07,594 --> 00:42:08,284
up north.

1171
00:42:08,318 --> 00:42:11,183
I'm from Philly.

1172
00:42:11,218 --> 00:42:12,840
You got me out.

1173
00:42:12,875 --> 00:42:14,290
You and me, babe, a couple of

1174
00:42:14,324 --> 00:42:15,602
Irish war heroes.

1175
00:42:15,636 --> 00:42:18,881
I got ya out?

1176
00:42:18,915 --> 00:42:19,985
I got ya out of jail.

1177
00:42:20,020 --> 00:42:20,641
Yeah.

1178
00:42:20,676 --> 00:42:21,366
Well, I helped you then,

1179
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:22,263
let me help you now.

1180
00:42:22,298 --> 00:42:23,610
Just tell me what you want.

1181
00:42:23,644 --> 00:42:25,784
We've got demands.

1182
00:42:25,819 --> 00:42:27,027
You're the messenger.

1183
00:42:27,061 --> 00:42:28,373
We got messages to get out.

1184
00:42:28,407 --> 00:42:29,270
Can't trust the radio,

1185
00:42:29,305 --> 00:42:30,478
someone's always listening,

1186
00:42:30,513 --> 00:42:31,134
right?

1187
00:42:31,169 --> 00:42:32,377
Okay, let's-- let's talk

1188
00:42:32,411 --> 00:42:33,033
about it.

1189
00:42:33,067 --> 00:42:34,413
First, we wait for

1190
00:42:34,448 --> 00:42:35,276
Larry King.

1191
00:42:35,311 --> 00:42:38,107
Okay, okay.

1192
00:42:38,141 --> 00:42:39,246
When is this lunatic going to

1193
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:42,698
get to what he wants?

1194
00:42:42,732 --> 00:42:46,805
But most important...

1195
00:42:46,840 --> 00:42:49,774
is, we've been double-crossed.

1196
00:42:53,329 --> 00:42:54,330
What's that?

1197
00:42:54,364 --> 00:42:55,503
What are you talking about?

1198
00:43:00,785 --> 00:43:02,062
Wires?!

1199
00:43:02,096 --> 00:43:03,719
You've got wires?!

1200
00:43:03,753 --> 00:43:05,962
Get up. Get up!

1201
00:43:11,865 --> 00:43:12,520
Is that it?

1202
00:43:12,555 --> 00:43:13,211
Any more?

1203
00:43:13,245 --> 00:43:15,006
Uh, the cops made me wear it.

1204
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:15,662
I Didn't know it was you

1205
00:43:15,696 --> 00:43:20,114
up here.

1206
00:43:20,149 --> 00:43:21,702
You're a liar.

1207
00:43:21,737 --> 00:43:27,397
You're a liar!

1208
00:43:27,432 --> 00:43:30,573
You lie, you die.

1209
00:43:30,608 --> 00:43:31,505
Hey.

1210
00:43:31,539 --> 00:43:32,644
[Justine] No.

1211
00:43:32,679 --> 00:43:33,887
[whimpering]

1212
00:43:33,921 --> 00:43:35,509
No.

1213
00:43:35,543 --> 00:43:36,648
[Flynn] Fugazi, he's hit!

1214
00:43:36,683 --> 00:43:39,651
Officer's hit!

1215
00:43:39,686 --> 00:43:41,722
Fugazi, fugazi.

1216
00:43:41,757 --> 00:43:45,208
Over and out.

1217
00:43:45,243 --> 00:43:46,278
[radio static]

1218
00:43:46,313 --> 00:43:47,279
What officer was hit?

1219
00:43:47,314 --> 00:43:48,142
What-- who fired?

1220
00:43:48,177 --> 00:43:49,005
No one fired.

1221
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:50,973
I-- I don't-- I don't know what

1222
00:43:51,007 --> 00:43:53,561
the hell is going on.

1223
00:43:53,596 --> 00:43:55,702
What is "fugazi"?

1224
00:43:55,736 --> 00:43:57,358
In 'Nam, it meant completely

1225
00:43:57,393 --> 00:43:59,740
and totally screwed up.

1226
00:43:59,775 --> 00:44:02,812
All right.

1227
00:44:02,847 --> 00:44:03,813
Send in the other assault teams.

1228
00:44:03,848 --> 00:44:04,503
Let's just wait--

1229
00:44:04,538 --> 00:44:05,504
Hey look, Waters, I'm not

1230
00:44:05,539 --> 00:44:06,195
gonna debate this with you,

1231
00:44:06,229 --> 00:44:06,885
all right?

1232
00:44:06,920 --> 00:44:07,541
You're job is to handle the

1233
00:44:07,575 --> 00:44:08,715
perimeter of the hotel.

1234
00:44:08,749 --> 00:44:10,164
My job is to handle all matters

1235
00:44:10,199 --> 00:44:11,372
related to the inside of

1236
00:44:11,407 --> 00:44:12,028
the hotel.

1237
00:44:12,063 --> 00:44:12,719
You are going to get

1238
00:44:12,753 --> 00:44:17,758
everybody killed.

1239
00:44:17,793 --> 00:44:18,932
[sighing]

1240
00:44:18,966 --> 00:44:19,691
You weren't supposed to die,

1241
00:44:19,726 --> 00:44:22,211
Charlie.

1242
00:44:22,245 --> 00:44:22,970
Why didn't you just hit him with

1243
00:44:23,005 --> 00:44:24,213
your fist?

1244
00:44:24,247 --> 00:44:28,148
We needed him to negotiate.

1245
00:44:28,182 --> 00:44:30,357
Can I have his shoes?

1246
00:44:30,391 --> 00:44:32,014
He's not a hog, Kenny.

1247
00:44:36,812 --> 00:44:39,815
We need to make a statement.

1248
00:44:50,549 --> 00:44:51,447
It's okay.

1249
00:44:51,481 --> 00:44:54,553
It'll be okay.

1250
00:45:03,321 --> 00:45:04,736
Look, I feel really bad about

1251
00:45:04,771 --> 00:45:06,151
your top.

1252
00:45:06,186 --> 00:45:07,670
We can go out tomorrow again if

1253
00:45:07,705 --> 00:45:09,223
you want to look for it.

1254
00:45:09,258 --> 00:45:09,879
Got my own boat.

1255
00:45:09,914 --> 00:45:12,226
Okay.

1256
00:45:12,261 --> 00:45:13,918
Charlie left you a message.

1257
00:45:13,952 --> 00:45:15,126
He's with a whole bunch of

1258
00:45:15,160 --> 00:45:16,334
federal agents.

1259
00:45:16,368 --> 00:45:18,232
He wants help with some, uh,

1260
00:45:18,267 --> 00:45:19,371
hostage something.

1261
00:45:19,406 --> 00:45:21,891
Huh, dream on.

1262
00:45:21,926 --> 00:45:23,375
I knew that either you or

1263
00:45:23,410 --> 00:45:24,687
that kid would end up with all

1264
00:45:24,722 --> 00:45:25,446
the chicks.

1265
00:45:25,481 --> 00:45:27,483
But tonight, she and her

1266
00:45:27,517 --> 00:45:29,243
stepmother, along with Susan

1267
00:45:29,278 --> 00:45:30,831
Sinclair's personal aide,

1268
00:45:30,866 --> 00:45:32,868
Ricki Stewart, are all being

1269
00:45:32,902 --> 00:45:34,248
held hostage.

1270
00:45:34,283 --> 00:45:34,939
Wait a minute.

1271
00:45:34,973 --> 00:45:36,595
So far no word on how many

1272
00:45:36,630 --> 00:45:38,252
kidnappers are involved.

1273
00:45:38,287 --> 00:45:39,633
And there is nothing known

1274
00:45:39,667 --> 00:45:41,048
regarding their release of

1275
00:45:41,083 --> 00:45:41,946
the trio.

1276
00:45:41,980 --> 00:45:43,879
This event comes on the eve

1277
00:45:43,913 --> 00:45:45,570
that most experts predicted

1278
00:45:45,604 --> 00:45:46,571
would be the beginning of

1279
00:45:46,605 --> 00:45:48,331
Congressman Sinclair's first

1280
00:45:48,366 --> 00:45:49,919
overtures for the nomination

1281
00:45:49,954 --> 00:45:50,609
for governor.

1282
00:45:50,644 --> 00:45:51,749
Get on with it, lady.

1283
00:45:51,783 --> 00:45:53,474
This is Miles McCurdy,

1284
00:45:53,509 --> 00:45:54,993
Congressman Sinclair's

1285
00:45:55,028 --> 00:45:56,063
spokesman.

1286
00:45:56,098 --> 00:45:56,857
What can you tell us,

1287
00:45:56,892 --> 00:45:58,514
Mr. McCurdy, about the

1288
00:45:58,548 --> 00:45:59,757
congressman's reaction

1289
00:45:59,791 --> 00:46:00,999
to these events?

1290
00:46:01,034 --> 00:46:01,793
Well, the, uh, the

1291
00:46:01,828 --> 00:46:03,691
congressman is obviously

1292
00:46:03,726 --> 00:46:05,659
extremely distraught over these

1293
00:46:05,693 --> 00:46:07,799
terrible turn of events.

1294
00:46:07,834 --> 00:46:09,490
He would like to thank very

1295
00:46:09,525 --> 00:46:11,596
much his supporters for all of

1296
00:46:11,630 --> 00:46:13,287
their aid during this, uh,

1297
00:46:13,322 --> 00:46:14,668
highly emotional time.

1298
00:46:14,702 --> 00:46:16,428
Uh, at this very moment, a

1299
00:46:16,463 --> 00:46:17,498
hostage negotiator is on

1300
00:46:17,533 --> 00:46:18,776
the scene, Officer Charles

1301
00:46:18,810 --> 00:46:21,019
Guffy-- uh, Duffy, is on the

1302
00:46:21,054 --> 00:46:23,125
scene, uh, meeting with the,

1303
00:46:23,159 --> 00:46:24,574
uh, hostage takers.

1304
00:46:24,609 --> 00:46:26,818
Uh, uh, attempting to ascertain

1305
00:46:26,853 --> 00:46:28,647
what their demands are.

1306
00:46:28,682 --> 00:46:29,303
Thank you, very much.

1307
00:46:29,338 --> 00:46:29,994
And now, back to the studio.

1308
00:46:30,028 --> 00:46:31,512
Charlie, he's-- what the hell

1309
00:46:31,547 --> 00:46:34,688
are you doing?

1310
00:46:34,722 --> 00:46:35,793
I gotta go down there.

1311
00:46:35,827 --> 00:46:36,828
Well, you'll never get by

1312
00:46:36,863 --> 00:46:37,829
the perimeter.

1313
00:46:37,864 --> 00:46:39,106
Captain Waters will have you

1314
00:46:39,141 --> 00:46:40,556
thrown out.

1315
00:46:40,590 --> 00:46:42,006
No, I'll get down there, and

1316
00:46:42,040 --> 00:46:44,698
I'll get in, 'cause I got...

1317
00:46:44,732 --> 00:46:45,975
a police detective with me.

1318
00:46:46,010 --> 00:46:46,907
Take care of the ladies,

1319
00:46:46,942 --> 00:46:48,806
will you, Tony?

1320
00:46:51,739 --> 00:46:52,395
[indistinct radio chatter]

1321
00:46:52,430 --> 00:46:56,986
Hey, Richard.

1322
00:46:57,021 --> 00:46:58,954
Richard.

1323
00:46:58,988 --> 00:46:59,644
You hear me?

1324
00:46:59,678 --> 00:47:00,921
Yeah, I heard ya.

1325
00:47:00,956 --> 00:47:01,888
Where's Charlie?

1326
00:47:01,922 --> 00:47:03,303
He's inside.

1327
00:47:03,337 --> 00:47:03,959
How the hell did you work

1328
00:47:03,993 --> 00:47:04,994
that out?

1329
00:47:05,029 --> 00:47:06,202
I didn't, he was asked for by

1330
00:47:06,237 --> 00:47:07,652
the terrorists.

1331
00:47:07,686 --> 00:47:08,515
What?

1332
00:47:08,549 --> 00:47:09,516
Yeah.

1333
00:47:09,550 --> 00:47:10,828
Tums out he's got more guts than

1334
00:47:10,862 --> 00:47:12,139
anybody gives him credit for.

1335
00:47:12,174 --> 00:47:12,899
I know how much guts

1336
00:47:12,933 --> 00:47:13,589
he's got.

1337
00:47:13,623 --> 00:47:14,348
That's why I'm here.

[distant sirens, helicopter]

1716
01:01:56,574 --> 01:01:59,094
Can-- can I have some gum?

1717
01:01:59,129 --> 01:02:00,130
What?

1718
01:02:00,164 --> 01:02:01,510
Gum.

1719
01:02:01,545 --> 01:02:04,444
Uh, you have some in your purse.

1720
01:02:04,479 --> 01:02:07,378
Uh, sure.

1721
01:02:07,413 --> 01:02:08,897
You can have some gum, yeah.

1722
01:02:25,155 --> 01:02:26,777
Are they gonna kill us?

1723
01:02:26,812 --> 01:02:27,778
We're gonna be all right,

1724
01:02:27,813 --> 01:02:30,194
Justine.

1725
01:02:30,229 --> 01:02:33,128
I am so sorry.

1726
01:02:33,163 --> 01:02:35,441
For what?

1727
01:02:35,475 --> 01:02:39,376
I've treated you so badly.

1728
01:02:39,410 --> 01:02:42,310
I'm sorry, too.

1729
01:02:42,344 --> 01:02:43,621
I'm never gonna ground you

1730
01:02:43,656 --> 01:02:44,622
again.

1731
01:02:44,657 --> 01:02:45,278
[laughing nervously]

1732
01:02:45,313 --> 01:02:46,348
You won't have to.

1733
01:02:46,383 --> 01:02:48,005
I'm going to ground myself.

1734
01:02:48,040 --> 01:02:48,765
Oh, you better pick an

1735
01:02:48,799 --> 01:02:49,869
understanding husband, because

1736
01:02:49,904 --> 01:02:50,801
I'm never going to let you out

1737
01:02:50,836 --> 01:02:52,009
of my sight.

1738
01:02:52,044 --> 01:02:53,183
Okay.

1739
01:02:53,217 --> 01:02:54,874
I will.

1740
01:03:01,018 --> 01:03:03,158
It-- it's good you listen

1741
01:03:03,193 --> 01:03:06,610
to your momma.

1742
01:03:06,644 --> 01:03:11,580
I-- I don't have a momma.

1743
01:03:11,615 --> 01:03:14,411
I'm sorry.

1744
01:03:17,828 --> 01:03:20,382
Want-- want some gum?

1745
01:03:26,319 --> 01:03:27,873
Uh, that's a negative, still

01:03:33,533 --> 01:03:35,259
Bound up.

1751
01:03:35,294 --> 01:03:36,709
Uh, roger, Charlie One.

1752
01:03:36,743 --> 01:03:37,917
Uh, stand by.

1753
01:03:37,952 --> 01:03:39,608
T.O.C. says there's a wild

1754
01:03:39,643 --> 01:03:43,095
card in the building.

1755
01:03:43,129 --> 01:03:44,648
Repeat, there's a wild card in

1756
01:03:44,682 --> 01:03:46,961
the building.

1757
01:03:46,995 --> 01:03:48,272
I hope he's not a friendly,

1758
01:03:48,307 --> 01:03:50,861
boss, because he'll get wasted.

1759
01:04:20,304 --> 01:04:22,686
Waters... did you send

1760
01:04:22,720 --> 01:04:24,826
somebody in there?

1761
01:04:24,861 --> 01:04:26,241
No.

1762
01:04:26,276 --> 01:04:27,277
Interfering in a federal

1763
01:04:27,311 --> 01:04:31,660
investigation is a felony.

1764
01:04:31,695 --> 01:04:33,559
It's Logan McQueen,

1765
01:04:33,593 --> 01:04:36,251
Charlie Duffy's old partner.

1766
01:04:36,286 --> 01:04:37,528
He's crazy.

1767
01:04:37,563 --> 01:04:38,460
But if I was in there, I'd want

1768
01:04:38,495 --> 01:04:39,945
him sent in.

1769
01:04:39,979 --> 01:04:40,877
And if you knew him, you'd feel

1770
01:04:40,911 --> 01:04:43,224
exactly the same way.

1771
01:04:43,258 --> 01:04:44,466
So why don't you get smart and

1772
01:04:44,501 --> 01:04:45,364
try to figure out some way to

1773
01:04:45,398 --> 01:04:47,711
help him?

1774
01:04:47,745 --> 01:04:48,470
Let me tell you something,

1775
01:04:48,505 --> 01:04:49,333
if he does something stupid in

1776
01:04:49,368 --> 01:04:49,989
there, we're going to have to

1777
01:04:50,024 --> 01:04:50,956
kill him ourselves.

1778
01:04:50,990 --> 01:04:52,474
I got a team in there too, pal.

1779
01:04:52,509 --> 01:04:53,130
Yeah?

1780
01:04:53,165 --> 01:04:53,820
Yeah.

1781
01:04:53,855 --> 01:04:54,511
Well, I just hope he doesn't

1782
01:04:54,545 --> 01:04:55,684
have to stop them from doing

1783
01:04:55,719 --> 01:05:00,172
something stupid.

1785

end of this corridor.

1786
01:05:16,257 --> 01:05:17,396
Oh, yeah?

1787
01:05:17,430 --> 01:05:19,087
Pick it up, bound up.

1788
01:05:19,122 --> 01:05:21,883
We've got three floors to go.

1789
01:05:21,918 --> 01:05:22,988
Great.

01:05:23,022 --> 01:05:25,335
Up.

1791
01:05:25,369 --> 01:05:27,785
They're cold-blooded killers.

1792
01:05:27,820 --> 01:05:28,925
They're trying to kill people.

1793
01:05:28,959 --> 01:05:32,894
Yeah.

1794
01:05:32,929 --> 01:05:34,516

1795
01:05:34,551 --> 01:05:36,725
Aah!

We're not alone.

If he didn't know where we

1802
01:06:21,563 --> 01:06:24,049
were, he does now.

1803
01:06:24,083 --> 01:06:28,950

Yeah, tell me about it.

1809

He's close by.

1810
01:07:12,649 --> 01:07:14,064
I can feel him.

1811
01:07:28,113 --> 01:07:29,666

What's your name, soldier?

1822

Corporal.

1823
01:08:03,251 --> 01:08:05,253
What was your rank?

1824
01:08:05,288 --> 01:08:05,978
I was a little higher

1825
01:08:06,012 --> 01:08:08,463
than you.

1826
01:08:08,498 --> 01:08:11,328
Nobody was higher than me.

Don't know who is who up here.

1834

Roger that, Team Three.

never finds you!
