1
00:00:03,020 --> 00:00:05,220
(speaking Arabic)

2
00:00:06,567 --> 00:00:08,724
Hey, Fawz, uh, who are your friends?

3
00:00:08,726 --> 00:00:10,392
Some Iraqi investors I put together.

4
00:00:10,394 --> 00:00:11,727
We're looking for properties to buy,

5
00:00:11,729 --> 00:00:13,729
and I wanted to show
them your beautiful shop,

6
00:00:13,731 --> 00:00:15,801
the jewel of Uptown.

7
00:00:15,994 --> 00:00:17,331
Now, we could use a bulldozer,

8
00:00:17,335 --> 00:00:20,068
but a wrecking ball will be faster.

9
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:21,970
Fawz, how many times
do I have to tell you?

10
00:00:21,972 --> 00:00:23,062
I'm not selling the shop.

11
00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:25,407
But, Arthur, they have a lot of money.

12
00:00:25,409 --> 00:00:26,942
They're willing to overpay.

13
00:00:26,944 --> 00:00:29,011
That word doesn't even exist in Arabic.

14
00:00:29,013 --> 00:00:30,646
They had to say it in English.

15
00:00:31,749 --> 00:00:33,348
Fawz, uh, would you get out.

16
00:00:33,350 --> 00:00:36,151
Fine. Yours is not the only
dying business on the block.

17
00:00:36,153 --> 00:00:37,219
(speaking Arabic)

18
00:00:37,263 --> 00:00:41,089
Come on, I'll show you something
they used to call a "bookstore."

19
00:00:42,893 --> 00:00:46,628
Ciao, bella. <i>Dov'é la biblioteca?</i>

20
00:00:46,630 --> 00:00:49,331
Ah, the library's down the street,

21
00:00:49,333 --> 00:00:51,767
and thanks for calling me beautiful.

22
00:00:51,769 --> 00:00:54,803
Want to meet me later
behind the<i> biblioteca?</i>

23
00:00:54,805 --> 00:00:56,772
(chuckles) I'm getting
ready to go to Florence,

24
00:00:56,774 --> 00:00:58,407
so Tavi's making me learn Italian.

25
00:00:58,409 --> 00:01:01,410
You know,
a lot of people in Italy speak English.

26
00:01:01,412 --> 00:01:03,378
I know, but, you know,
our relationship's

27
00:01:03,380 --> 00:01:04,646
been a little rocky lately,

28
00:01:04,648 --> 00:01:06,081
and I'm trying to do my best to,

29
00:01:06,083 --> 00:01:07,449
you know, go with the flow.

30
00:01:07,451 --> 00:01:09,818
Plus, she really wants us to fit in.

31
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:13,755
I guess there's some Italians who
don't exactly love black people.

32
00:01:13,757 --> 00:01:15,891
So she's making you do homework

33
00:01:15,893 --> 00:01:19,394
and making you feel
bad about being black.

34
00:01:19,396 --> 00:01:22,764
You can get that at any
school right here in Chicago.

35
00:01:23,801 --> 00:01:24,843
Well, you know, it's a good thing

36
00:01:24,869 --> 00:01:27,402
I held on to this old
"Help Wanted" sign.

37
00:01:27,404 --> 00:01:29,037
I thought you threw that
out when you hired me.

38
00:01:29,039 --> 00:01:31,573
Yeah, but I pulled it out of the
trash when you started ranting

39
00:01:31,575 --> 00:01:35,911
about how mass incarceration of
black men was the new slavery.

40
00:01:35,913 --> 00:01:37,010
Well, you have no idea what it's like

41
00:01:37,014 --> 00:01:39,915
to have your people rounded
up and locked away for no...

42
00:01:39,917 --> 00:01:41,717
You know what, let's just drop it.

43
00:01:41,719 --> 00:01:43,318
Sorry.

44
00:01:45,456 --> 00:01:47,689
Can't believe I'm gonna
hire a new person.

45
00:01:47,691 --> 00:01:49,174
Now, I don't think
you know this about me,

46
00:01:49,193 --> 00:01:51,326
but I'm not great with people.

47
00:01:54,305 --> 00:01:57,427
Arthur, why don't you hire Tush?
It's only for three months.

48
00:01:57,462 --> 00:01:58,200
No.

49
00:01:58,202 --> 00:01:59,801
I think I'm gonna need
someone longer than that.

50
00:01:59,803 --> 00:02:01,470
I mean, let's face it, the...

51
00:02:01,472 --> 00:02:02,904
Franco's not coming back to the shop.

52
00:02:02,906 --> 00:02:04,306
Did he tell you that?

53
00:02:04,308 --> 00:02:06,675
No, but, I mean, come on,
he's-he's going to college,

54
00:02:06,677 --> 00:02:08,410
he's gonna spend the summer in Europe.

55
00:02:08,412 --> 00:02:10,412
He's gonna expand his horizons.

56
00:02:10,414 --> 00:02:12,848
You know, this place
is gonna be too small for him.

57
00:02:14,023 --> 00:02:15,817
Am I gonna be too small for him?

58
00:02:16,941 --> 00:02:19,055
Arthur, aren't you happy for Franco?

59
00:02:19,090 --> 00:02:21,056
Seriously, somebody answer me.

60
00:02:22,948 --> 00:02:25,062
I'm too old to make new friends.

61
00:02:25,434 --> 00:02:27,172
No, of course I'm happy for him.

62
00:02:27,264 --> 00:02:29,831
He's gonna have a whole new
adventure in his life, you know.

63
00:02:29,833 --> 00:02:34,736
Which is what I'll be thinking about
when I'm snaking that damn toilet.

64
00:02:35,574 --> 00:02:38,006
You, uh, you like reading graphic novels

65
00:02:38,008 --> 00:02:41,209
and building pillow forts? (Chuckles)

66
00:02:46,134 --> 00:02:48,383
I'm gonna die alone.

67
00:02:48,385 --> 00:02:50,652
♪ ♪

68
00:03:03,470 --> 00:03:07,261
Good morning, gentlemen.
I have come to inquire about the job.

69
00:03:07,263 --> 00:03:10,031
So I guess you're serious about
giving up the gig economy?

70
00:03:10,083 --> 00:03:11,883
Yeah, I'm ready to find a full-time job,

71
00:03:11,885 --> 00:03:13,351
jump back into the rat race.

72
00:03:13,353 --> 00:03:17,288
As opposed to my last gig,
which was organizing rat races.

73
00:03:18,155 --> 00:03:20,494
Well, you know, he definitely
knows his way around the shop.

74
00:03:20,529 --> 00:03:21,992
Yup, ask me anything.

75
00:03:22,034 --> 00:03:23,901
Your biggest seller: The maple creme.

76
00:03:23,903 --> 00:03:27,104
Your biggest mistake:
The baby back rib donut.

77
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:30,107
It was like the bacon donut,
only with more meat.

78
00:03:30,109 --> 00:03:32,409
And bone.

79
00:03:32,411 --> 00:03:33,710
Okay, fine.

80
00:03:33,712 --> 00:03:36,380
Here's an application, and a pen.

81
00:03:36,382 --> 00:03:38,115
Thank you.

82
00:03:38,556 --> 00:03:40,951
Greetings, fellow donutarians.

83
00:03:40,953 --> 00:03:43,387
Greetings, neighborhood vagrant.

84
00:03:44,723 --> 00:03:46,023
You know the rules, Trashcan Lou.

85
00:03:46,025 --> 00:03:48,091
You got to buy something
before you use the bathroom.

86
00:03:48,093 --> 00:03:51,862
Correction: Today,
I am Job Applicant Lou.

87
00:03:51,864 --> 00:03:55,732
Well, well, I hope you can
handle a little competition.

88
00:03:55,734 --> 00:03:58,635
I just wrestled a stray
dog for a pizza crust,

89
00:03:58,637 --> 00:04:01,271
so yeah, bring it on.

90
00:04:03,475 --> 00:04:06,610
Okeydokey. So, uh, Lou,
do you have any, uh, work experience?

91
00:04:06,612 --> 00:04:09,480
I worked construction,
did a short stint at a Burger King,

92
00:04:09,482 --> 00:04:13,383
and I am this close to becoming
a certified vampire hunter.

93
00:04:14,852 --> 00:04:16,653
How about you fill out
a job application, man?

94
00:04:16,655 --> 00:04:18,222
Are you serious?

95
00:04:18,224 --> 00:04:20,624
Why not? He cleaned himself up,
he's-he's-he's making an effort,

96
00:04:20,626 --> 00:04:22,626
and, you know,
he's not gonna hurt nobody.

97
00:04:22,628 --> 00:04:24,761
Unless that's part of the job.

98
00:04:26,943 --> 00:04:28,298
- Hey.
- What's up, So'?

99
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:30,434
I brought you something for your trip.

100
00:04:30,436 --> 00:04:32,903
It's my journal from when I
backpacked through Europe.

101
00:04:32,905 --> 00:04:35,639
- Oh. (Sniffs) Phew.
- (chuckles)

102
00:04:35,641 --> 00:04:37,908
Somebody went to Amsterdam.

103
00:04:38,324 --> 00:04:41,044
Yeah, I got there January.
A week later, it was March.

104
00:04:41,046 --> 00:04:42,846
(both laugh)

105
00:04:42,848 --> 00:04:44,314
Um, but I also went to Florence,

106
00:04:44,316 --> 00:04:46,647
and this might give you
some ideas of stuff to do.

107
00:04:46,652 --> 00:04:48,285
Okay. Uh, who's this guy?

108
00:04:48,287 --> 00:04:49,553
Oh, my God, he's so awesome.

109
00:04:49,555 --> 00:04:51,154
- He dresses up like a clown...
- Mm-hmm.

110
00:04:51,156 --> 00:04:53,757
And then he sings opera in
this village outside of Florence.

111
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:55,092
Wait, like the lady we saw on Navy Pier

112
00:04:55,094 --> 00:04:56,226
- who has that accordion?
- Uh-huh.

113
00:04:56,228 --> 00:04:57,461
Remember-remember,
I paid her five dollars

114
00:04:57,463 --> 00:04:58,629
to play Bone Thugs-n-Harmony?

115
00:04:58,631 --> 00:05:00,030
And I paid her ten to stop.

116
00:05:00,032 --> 00:05:01,899
(both laughing)

117
00:05:01,901 --> 00:05:03,246
Anyway, uh,

118
00:05:03,302 --> 00:05:06,129
this guy's weird and hilarious,
and I'm sure you'll love it.

119
00:05:06,164 --> 00:05:07,037
Well, you know I'm with it.

120
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:09,306
Let me text Tavi real quick
and see if she wants to go.

121
00:05:09,308 --> 00:05:11,008
Maybe after we see this clown,
we can get some,

122
00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:12,376
like, authentic Italian food.

123
00:05:12,378 --> 00:05:13,911
You think Italy got Olive Garden?

124
00:05:13,913 --> 00:05:17,581
Oh, you're so cute.

125
00:05:17,583 --> 00:05:19,249
(phone chimes)

126
00:05:19,251 --> 00:05:21,190
That was quick.
(chuckles) Let me see what she said.

127
00:05:21,487 --> 00:05:22,625
"What are you talking about?

128
00:05:22,655 --> 00:05:24,655
Clowns freak me out.
Where'd this come from?"

129
00:05:24,657 --> 00:05:27,224
- You know what, I think she's gonna pass.
- Oh.

130
00:05:27,226 --> 00:05:30,360
I'm ready for my interview!

131
00:05:32,398 --> 00:05:34,998
All right, cool, let's get started.
Arthur!

132
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,935
All right, Lou.
Why don't you take a seat.

133
00:05:37,937 --> 00:05:40,170
Franco is making a huge mistake.

134
00:05:40,172 --> 00:05:43,407
Are we talking the beads in
the hair or the lady boots?

135
00:05:44,534 --> 00:05:48,011
No, I'm-I'm talking about
his trip to Italy with Tavi.

136
00:05:48,013 --> 00:05:49,646
They think it'll fix their relationship,

137
00:05:49,648 --> 00:05:51,348
like those couples who
fight all the time,

138
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:52,883
and so they have a baby.

139
00:05:52,885 --> 00:05:55,619
Yeah, Tavi's all wrong for him.

140
00:05:55,621 --> 00:05:59,256
Huh. You sure this is
about Franco and Tavi

141
00:05:59,258 --> 00:06:01,258
and not your feelings for him?

142
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:03,794
(sighs) Maybe a little of both.

143
00:06:06,387 --> 00:06:10,634
No, it's about Franco and Tavi, mostly,

144
00:06:10,636 --> 00:06:13,070
- and a little bit me.
- Okay, look.

145
00:06:13,797 --> 00:06:15,305
You ready for some tough love?

146
00:06:15,307 --> 00:06:18,108
Well,
I am a little vulnerable right now.

147
00:06:18,110 --> 00:06:19,509
(clears throat)

148
00:06:19,511 --> 00:06:20,744
Sofia,

149
00:06:20,746 --> 00:06:23,714
you had plenty of chances
to tell him how you feel,

150
00:06:23,716 --> 00:06:24,881
and you didn't.

151
00:06:24,883 --> 00:06:27,618
Three days before he takes
his girlfriend to Italy

152
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:29,086
is not the time.

153
00:06:29,088 --> 00:06:31,088
- You're right.
- Mm-hmm.

154
00:06:31,090 --> 00:06:32,956
You're right. I-I should've,

155
00:06:32,958 --> 00:06:36,326
I didn't, I need to move on.

156
00:06:36,328 --> 00:06:39,930
And so, in conclusion,
you may call me Trashcan Lou,

157
00:06:39,932 --> 00:06:44,468
but my motto is "Trash Can Do."

158
00:06:44,470 --> 00:06:46,336
Cool. All right, uh,
thanks for coming in, Lou,

159
00:06:46,338 --> 00:06:47,371
and, uh, we'll let you know.

160
00:06:47,373 --> 00:06:50,273
Right now. No.

161
00:06:50,275 --> 00:06:51,708
Tush, you got the job.

162
00:06:51,710 --> 00:06:54,711
Yes! I can't work Fridays.

163
00:06:54,713 --> 00:06:56,880
He didn't even finish his application!

164
00:06:56,882 --> 00:06:59,683
I really need this job.
I'm trying to turn my life around.

165
00:06:59,685 --> 00:07:01,485
Well, you still got the vampire thing.

166
00:07:01,487 --> 00:07:03,820
That's seasonal!

167
00:07:04,594 --> 00:07:07,190
Come on, I just need
somebody to give me a chance.

168
00:07:07,192 --> 00:07:10,027
I don't know what to tell you,
man, I'm sorry.

169
00:07:10,029 --> 00:07:12,629
But, hey, you know what?
How about a free donut?

170
00:07:12,631 --> 00:07:15,132
Gee, thanks. Do you have a donut

171
00:07:15,134 --> 00:07:19,102
that'll clothe me and feed
me and give me shelter?

172
00:07:20,572 --> 00:07:21,938
Bear claw.

173
00:07:25,944 --> 00:07:27,944
All right, so, uh,
before you leave every night,

174
00:07:27,946 --> 00:07:29,780
make sure the sugar canisters are full.

175
00:07:29,782 --> 00:07:32,916
Canisters, sugar, leave, full, are.

176
00:07:32,918 --> 00:07:35,519
Got it.

177
00:07:35,521 --> 00:07:39,856
Quick question... may I use the
deep fryer for personal items?

178
00:07:39,858 --> 00:07:42,793
Tater tots and fish sticks and such?

179
00:07:42,795 --> 00:07:43,994
No.

180
00:07:43,996 --> 00:07:45,962
I'll put down "maybe."

181
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:48,832
Uh, look, when we close up,

182
00:07:48,834 --> 00:07:50,434
you, uh, put the money in the safe.

183
00:07:50,436 --> 00:07:52,436
Uh, the combination
are the numbers for, uh,

184
00:07:52,438 --> 00:07:55,405
Ron Santo, Billy Williams, Ernie Banks.

185
00:07:55,407 --> 00:07:58,508
- It is not. I changed it.
- Why?

186
00:07:58,510 --> 00:08:00,610
'Cause you keep saying
it out loud in the shop.

187
00:08:02,047 --> 00:08:03,246
Damn, Randy.

188
00:08:03,248 --> 00:08:05,282
- You look amazing.
- Oh, thanks.

189
00:08:05,284 --> 00:08:07,451
But I can't get my dress fastened.

190
00:08:07,453 --> 00:08:08,752
- Oh, I got you.
- Okay.

191
00:08:08,754 --> 00:08:10,721
- You got big plans?
- Yeah.

192
00:08:10,723 --> 00:08:14,091
I'm going on a date with
that guy from Bumble, Shawn.

193
00:08:14,093 --> 00:08:17,027
It's our third date.
You know what they say...

194
00:08:17,029 --> 00:08:21,031
- third date, third time having sex.
- Yeah.

195
00:08:21,033 --> 00:08:22,165
(phone chimes)

196
00:08:22,167 --> 00:08:23,734
Oh, Arthur, that-that's Tavi, man.

197
00:08:23,736 --> 00:08:25,001
Can you get this for me?

198
00:08:25,003 --> 00:08:27,738
Yeah, yeah, sure.
Put on a lot of dresses in my time.

199
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:29,072
(phone chimes)

200
00:08:29,074 --> 00:08:32,409
- I mean Joanie. Just turn around, turn around.
- Oh.

201
00:08:33,122 --> 00:08:37,280
She's texting me every 30 seconds
to remind me to check her texts.

202
00:08:37,282 --> 00:08:40,684
She's just, she's just thoughtful. Yeah.

203
00:08:40,686 --> 00:08:43,720
You know, this is impossible.
Can I just staple it?

204
00:08:43,722 --> 00:08:45,388
(scoffs) No.

205
00:08:45,390 --> 00:08:47,524
- It's a very expensive dress.
- All right.

206
00:08:47,526 --> 00:08:50,026
And I need it to come off later.

207
00:08:51,864 --> 00:08:55,499
Hey, did you guys hear about
the nail salon next door?

208
00:08:55,501 --> 00:08:58,135
The owner is sick and she had to
sell it for pennies on the dollar.

209
00:08:58,137 --> 00:09:00,036
Oh, that's terrible.

210
00:09:00,038 --> 00:09:02,572
Not for me, they were my pennies.
(laughs)

211
00:09:03,227 --> 00:09:06,510
Arthur, I've got you surrounded.
The walls are closing in.

212
00:09:06,512 --> 00:09:10,247
You're the kosher meat in the
middle of a Fawz sandwich.

213
00:09:10,249 --> 00:09:12,716
I am not selling the shop.

214
00:09:12,718 --> 00:09:15,652
Come on, take the money. Life is short.

215
00:09:15,654 --> 00:09:18,588
Well, yours has been incredibly long,

216
00:09:18,590 --> 00:09:20,590
but the rest has got to be short, right?

217
00:09:20,592 --> 00:09:22,626
- Get out.
- Bah!

218
00:09:26,632 --> 00:09:28,398
Randy, do you need help with your dress?

219
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:29,633
- Yeah, yeah.
- Uh-huh.

220
00:09:29,635 --> 00:09:30,967
Yeah, this hook is impossible.

221
00:09:30,969 --> 00:09:32,202
It's not a hook, it's a snap.

222
00:09:32,204 --> 00:09:34,704
ALL: Oh, it's a snap.

223
00:09:34,706 --> 00:09:36,740
(sputters)

224
00:09:37,843 --> 00:09:38,909
Hey, Franco.

225
00:09:38,911 --> 00:09:40,110
- What up, So'?
- Um...

226
00:09:40,112 --> 00:09:42,379
I wanted to come in and say good-bye.

227
00:09:42,381 --> 00:09:45,081
- I'm not leaving for a couple more days.
- No, I know.

228
00:09:45,083 --> 00:09:48,585
Uh, but tomorrow morning,
I'm relocating my truck to the Loop.

229
00:09:48,587 --> 00:09:49,853
Why?

230
00:09:49,855 --> 00:09:52,989
Well, no one wants my
healthy food here in Uptown.

231
00:09:52,991 --> 00:09:57,294
They'd rather go to Steak on a Stick
or Cheese in a Cup or Pork in a Van.

232
00:09:58,697 --> 00:10:02,065
Oh, I don't think
that last one sells food.

233
00:10:03,449 --> 00:10:06,303
Okay, well, I'm still gonna
see you before I leave, right?

234
00:10:06,305 --> 00:10:07,804
Well, once I'm downtown,

235
00:10:07,806 --> 00:10:09,606
I'm gonna be putting in some long hours,

236
00:10:09,608 --> 00:10:12,509
you know,
to build a customer base, so...

237
00:10:13,776 --> 00:10:15,912
So this is good-bye, good-bye.

238
00:10:18,112 --> 00:10:19,916
All right, bring it in. (Chuckles)

239
00:10:23,322 --> 00:10:25,021
Okay.

240
00:10:26,124 --> 00:10:28,291
Wait, uh, Sofia,
b-before you leave, hold on.

241
00:10:28,293 --> 00:10:30,393
Hey, Tush, can you get
my backpack down there?

242
00:10:36,539 --> 00:10:38,835
So I was gonna frame
this for your birthday,

243
00:10:38,837 --> 00:10:41,071
but because I won't
be able to see you...

244
00:10:41,073 --> 00:10:43,273
Oh, my God, it's beautiful.

245
00:10:43,275 --> 00:10:44,441
I'm glad you like it.

246
00:10:44,443 --> 00:10:46,509
I love it.

247
00:10:49,514 --> 00:10:50,981
Okay. Well,

248
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:53,753
arrivederci.

249
00:10:54,119 --> 00:10:55,890
Bye.

250
00:10:57,054 --> 00:10:58,569
Ciao, bella.

251
00:10:59,889 --> 00:11:01,620
This is weird, man.

252
00:11:01,818 --> 00:11:03,960
I won't be able to see
Sofia here anymore.

253
00:11:03,962 --> 00:11:05,562
Well, you're not gonna be here, either.

254
00:11:05,564 --> 00:11:06,730
Why you keep saying that?

255
00:11:06,732 --> 00:11:08,164
You mad 'cause I'm going to Italy?

256
00:11:08,166 --> 00:11:09,366
You told me I could go.

257
00:11:09,368 --> 00:11:11,301
No, I was just saying,
it must be nice to be young,

258
00:11:11,303 --> 00:11:13,203
and be able to do whatever you want.

259
00:11:13,594 --> 00:11:15,305
So, you go have fun.

260
00:11:15,307 --> 00:11:19,709
I'll still be here,
dying slowly of powdered sugar lung.

261
00:11:21,513 --> 00:11:23,914
Is that a thing?

262
00:11:24,704 --> 00:11:25,849
All right, let's go, Franco.

263
00:11:25,851 --> 00:11:27,050
Store closes at 6:00.

264
00:11:27,052 --> 00:11:28,218
We got to get you a suit.

265
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:29,419
Are we buying a suit?

266
00:11:29,421 --> 00:11:32,155
Yep. Tavi wants me to
have one for our trip.

267
00:11:32,157 --> 00:11:35,358
And we sure we want a guy named
"Sweatpants" as our stylist?

268
00:11:36,194 --> 00:11:37,594
No.

269
00:11:37,596 --> 00:11:38,929
Tavi's picking out the suit.

270
00:11:38,931 --> 00:11:41,264
And she's busy,
so she wants to FaceTime me.

271
00:11:41,926 --> 00:11:44,768
And I get to hold the phone.

272
00:11:44,770 --> 00:11:46,236
Hey, if you guys start talking dirty,

273
00:11:46,238 --> 00:11:49,239
that call will get dropped, literally.

274
00:11:49,241 --> 00:11:52,876
All right, Arthur,
Franco covered almost everything.

275
00:11:52,878 --> 00:11:55,145
Should any issues arise,

276
00:11:55,147 --> 00:11:57,547
where might I find HR?

277
00:11:57,549 --> 00:11:59,749
At the bottom of my leg,
when I put my foot up your ass

278
00:11:59,751 --> 00:12:01,184
for complaining.

279
00:12:02,287 --> 00:12:05,121
Noted.

280
00:12:05,417 --> 00:12:07,624
Hey. Is Franco still here?

281
00:12:07,626 --> 00:12:09,637
- You just missed him.
- Oh, good.

282
00:12:09,871 --> 00:12:11,394
Because I left my phone here,
and we just had

283
00:12:11,396 --> 00:12:13,897
this long good-bye, and
I don't want to do a second good-bye.

284
00:12:13,899 --> 00:12:15,265
Okay, I'm gonna stop you right there.

285
00:12:15,267 --> 00:12:18,835
Look, I don't have time for
your idle chitchat, okay?

286
00:12:18,837 --> 00:12:20,937
Arthur has left me in
charge of his baby.

287
00:12:20,939 --> 00:12:22,472
I have to be laser-focused

288
00:12:22,474 --> 00:12:24,841
to make sure that nothing goes wrong.

289
00:12:24,843 --> 00:12:26,710
Give me everything in the register.

290
00:12:27,454 --> 00:12:29,512
You see what you did?

291
00:12:38,889 --> 00:12:39,906
Don't shoot.

292
00:12:39,947 --> 00:12:42,513
I just ordered something from Amazon,
and if it's left

293
00:12:42,549 --> 00:12:45,058
outside my apartment,
it's gonna get stolen.

294
00:12:46,752 --> 00:12:48,652
Give me your phones, both of you.

295
00:12:50,356 --> 00:12:52,890
A flip phone?

296
00:12:52,892 --> 00:12:53,991
Don't push any buttons.

297
00:12:53,993 --> 00:12:56,560
I'm in the middle of a Minesweeper game.

298
00:12:56,562 --> 00:12:58,362
Get that register open.

299
00:12:58,364 --> 00:12:59,897
I just started, I don't know how.

300
00:12:59,899 --> 00:13:02,599
Uh, you...
You're gonna have to wait for Arthur!

301
00:13:02,601 --> 00:13:03,801
Who's not here!

302
00:13:03,803 --> 00:13:06,670
And should leave out the
back while he still can!

303
00:13:06,672 --> 00:13:07,671
What's that?

304
00:13:07,673 --> 00:13:10,374
I can't hear a thing...
oh, what the hell?

305
00:13:10,858 --> 00:13:12,076
Careful, he's got a gun!

306
00:13:12,128 --> 00:13:14,328
Yeah, or maybe he's got
his finger in his pocket.

307
00:13:14,330 --> 00:13:15,663
Careful, he's got a gun! He's got a gun.

308
00:13:15,665 --> 00:13:16,764
All right, all right, all right.

309
00:13:16,766 --> 00:13:18,099
Get that register open.

310
00:13:18,101 --> 00:13:19,801
All right, all right,
nobody needs to get hurt.

311
00:13:19,803 --> 00:13:21,769
Here you go.

312
00:13:22,495 --> 00:13:24,238
82 bucks? That's it?

313
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:27,074
You're the genius robbing a donut shop.

314
00:13:27,628 --> 00:13:28,576
There's got to be more than that.

315
00:13:28,578 --> 00:13:30,044
There's a safe in the kitchen.

316
00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:31,045
Tush!

317
00:13:31,208 --> 00:13:32,867
What? You're covered by insurance.

318
00:13:32,902 --> 00:13:33,654
Insurance?

319
00:13:33,656 --> 00:13:35,856
The only insurance I got is
the painting covering the safe.

320
00:13:35,858 --> 00:13:37,458
Oh, damn it.

321
00:13:37,460 --> 00:13:39,460
All right, I'm ready.

322
00:13:39,462 --> 00:13:40,527
Oh, no.

323
00:13:40,529 --> 00:13:43,163
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

324
00:13:43,165 --> 00:13:48,135
I am not wasting a bikini
wax on a hostage situation.

325
00:13:48,137 --> 00:13:49,403
Give me your phone,

326
00:13:49,405 --> 00:13:51,605
and your gun; I know you're a cop.

327
00:13:51,607 --> 00:13:52,973
Where would I have a gun?

328
00:13:53,527 --> 00:13:55,676
And how do you know I'm a cop?

329
00:13:56,766 --> 00:13:59,380
Trashcan Lou, is that you?

330
00:13:59,382 --> 00:14:00,614
It's just "Lou."

331
00:14:01,751 --> 00:14:05,085
"Trashcan" is hurtful.

332
00:14:05,087 --> 00:14:06,487
And, no, I'm not him.

333
00:14:06,489 --> 00:14:07,721
Just put the gun down.

334
00:14:07,723 --> 00:14:09,623
Leave,
we'll pretend this never happened.

335
00:14:09,625 --> 00:14:11,392
Okay, fine, it's me.

336
00:14:12,495 --> 00:14:14,295
Everybody, shut up,
and let's get in the kitchen.

337
00:14:14,297 --> 00:14:15,429
All right. Okay.

338
00:14:16,124 --> 00:14:17,765
How did you know it was me?

339
00:14:17,767 --> 00:14:20,234
I gave you that coat.

340
00:14:22,004 --> 00:14:23,737
I'm sorry, the place is a mess.

341
00:14:23,739 --> 00:14:25,906
I wasn't expecting a robbery.

342
00:14:28,044 --> 00:14:29,777
Oh, crap, I just remembered, um...

343
00:14:29,779 --> 00:14:31,845
Franco changed the
combination on the safe.

344
00:14:31,847 --> 00:14:33,747
- You expect me to believe that?
- No, it's true.

345
00:14:33,749 --> 00:14:35,249
We can't get into the
safe without Franco.

346
00:14:35,251 --> 00:14:36,917
- Hey, guys.
- Oh, crap.

347
00:14:38,109 --> 00:14:40,087
What's a panic attack?
'Cause I think I'm having one, right?

348
00:14:40,089 --> 00:14:42,456
- Uh...
- So, uh, I was trying on suits for Tavi on FaceTime,

349
00:14:42,458 --> 00:14:43,857
then my heart started beating fast,
all right?

350
00:14:43,859 --> 00:14:47,461
And then-then, my butt cheeks got hot...
real, real hot...

351
00:14:47,463 --> 00:14:48,662
Lou, what are you doing?

352
00:14:48,664 --> 00:14:49,763
Hello, Franco.

353
00:14:49,765 --> 00:14:50,764
I'm robbing you.

354
00:14:50,766 --> 00:14:52,266
Get that safe open.

355
00:14:52,268 --> 00:14:54,134
All right.

356
00:14:56,972 --> 00:14:58,305
I can't remember the combination.

357
00:14:58,307 --> 00:14:59,673
Don't pretend, kid, just open it.

358
00:14:59,675 --> 00:15:01,008
I'm not pretending, all right?

359
00:15:01,010 --> 00:15:02,810
I'm dizzy right now,
and my hands are shaking.

360
00:15:02,812 --> 00:15:05,346
LOU: Hey, it's okay.
Just close your eyes, breathe, relax,

361
00:15:05,348 --> 00:15:09,616
imagine you're lying on a
bed of soft little puppies.

362
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:11,885
Don't crush them!

363
00:15:11,887 --> 00:15:13,987
But I'm so big and they're so little.

364
00:15:13,989 --> 00:15:15,356
(phone chimes)

365
00:15:16,926 --> 00:15:17,991
I'm gonna need that phone.

366
00:15:17,993 --> 00:15:18,959
Okay, man.

367
00:15:18,961 --> 00:15:20,094
- Tavi?
- Yeah.

368
00:15:20,096 --> 00:15:21,362
She's probably wondering
what happened to me.

369
00:15:21,364 --> 00:15:23,597
I-I sort of freaked out
and ran out of the store.

370
00:15:23,599 --> 00:15:24,898
Why'd you freak out? I mean, that jacket

371
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:27,634
really flatters your build.

372
00:15:27,636 --> 00:15:29,436
I know why you freaked out.

373
00:15:29,438 --> 00:15:31,438
Franco, the panic attack is a sign.

374
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:34,541
Going to Italy with
Tavi is a huge mistake.

375
00:15:34,543 --> 00:15:35,529
What?

376
00:15:35,611 --> 00:15:38,212
You deserve to be with
someone who gets you.

377
00:15:38,214 --> 00:15:41,815
Someone who gets how amazing
and talented and fun you are.

378
00:15:41,817 --> 00:15:44,084
Someone who would go see
the opera clown with you.

379
00:15:44,086 --> 00:15:46,987
I would go see the opera clown with you.

380
00:15:47,341 --> 00:15:48,355
RANDY: Sofia,

381
00:15:48,357 --> 00:15:50,023
this isn't exactly the right time.

382
00:15:50,025 --> 00:15:52,826
No, I-I'm sorry, but he needs
to hear this in case we all die.

383
00:15:52,828 --> 00:15:55,729
Oh, no, no, no, no, honey,
nobody's gonna die.

384
00:15:55,731 --> 00:15:56,830
It's Lou.

385
00:15:56,832 --> 00:15:58,232
He's not gonna shoot anyone.

386
00:15:58,701 --> 00:16:00,701
- (shouting)
- Hey!

387
00:16:00,703 --> 00:16:02,269
Everybody thought I was
a big joke yesterday.

388
00:16:02,271 --> 00:16:04,171
Well, you're taking me seriously now.

389
00:16:04,173 --> 00:16:05,472
Get that safe open.

390
00:16:05,474 --> 00:16:08,575
All right, all right, man.

391
00:16:09,049 --> 00:16:10,077
It's Chicago Bulls numbers.

392
00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:12,312
Uh, damn, is it Pippen, Jordan, Rodman,

393
00:16:12,314 --> 00:16:14,681
or is it Rodman, Jordan, Grant?

394
00:16:14,683 --> 00:16:16,417
I thought it was white guy,
white guy, black guy.

395
00:16:16,419 --> 00:16:18,952
I would never pick two white guys, man!

396
00:16:20,189 --> 00:16:21,688
I got it. I got it, I got it.

397
00:16:21,690 --> 00:16:24,057
(exhales)

398
00:16:24,059 --> 00:16:25,225
(sighs, chuckles)

399
00:16:25,227 --> 00:16:26,827
It was two white guys.

400
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:29,129
Here you go.

401
00:16:29,131 --> 00:16:31,064
That's the whole week's take, 400 bucks.

402
00:16:31,066 --> 00:16:32,232
For a week?

403
00:16:32,234 --> 00:16:34,435
How are<i> you</i> not homeless?

404
00:16:35,143 --> 00:16:36,103
FAWZ: Hey, Arthur, guess what?

405
00:16:36,105 --> 00:16:38,338
There's a secret passage
right from the nail salon

406
00:16:38,340 --> 00:16:39,673
right to your basement!

407
00:16:39,675 --> 00:16:41,308
- Hey, buddy, get in here...
- Get over here.

408
00:16:41,310 --> 00:16:43,310
Put down... get the gun.

409
00:16:43,312 --> 00:16:44,511
Get the gun.

410
00:16:44,513 --> 00:16:47,214
- (grunts)
- All right, cuffs in my bag.

411
00:16:47,216 --> 00:16:48,449
Wait a minute, you don't have your gun,

412
00:16:48,451 --> 00:16:49,650
but you have your handcuffs?

413
00:16:49,652 --> 00:16:51,819
I told you, it's my third date.

414
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:03,940
So what's gonna happen to Lou?

415
00:17:03,942 --> 00:17:06,676
I got them to take him to a
psych hospital for evaluation,

416
00:17:06,678 --> 00:17:08,111
instead of lockup.

417
00:17:08,113 --> 00:17:10,614
It sucks the only way a
dude like Lou can get help

418
00:17:10,616 --> 00:17:12,315
- is if he gets locked up.
- Yeah.

419
00:17:12,317 --> 00:17:15,385
FYI, I posted on Instagram
that I saved you all,

420
00:17:15,387 --> 00:17:18,455
so if you could like it,
that'd be great.

421
00:17:19,718 --> 00:17:20,423
Hey, Arthur.

422
00:17:20,425 --> 00:17:21,625
How are you holding up?

423
00:17:21,627 --> 00:17:22,659
I don't know.

424
00:17:23,099 --> 00:17:24,027
When that shot went off,

425
00:17:24,029 --> 00:17:27,030
my whole life really did
flash before my eyes.

426
00:17:27,032 --> 00:17:29,032
Did you see that time we went fishing?

427
00:17:29,034 --> 00:17:31,267
'Cause that was fun.

428
00:17:31,269 --> 00:17:34,504
No, no, well, all I saw was donuts.

429
00:17:34,506 --> 00:17:37,207
My whole life,
making donuts in this place.

430
00:17:37,209 --> 00:17:39,442
What I should've seen
was Joanie and I, you know,

431
00:17:39,444 --> 00:17:42,646
on a cruise, or, uh, going to Europe.

432
00:17:42,648 --> 00:17:46,716
That didn't happen,
because I was always here.

433
00:17:47,714 --> 00:17:48,618
I'll be fine.

434
00:17:49,065 --> 00:17:50,487
Just need some rest.

435
00:17:52,324 --> 00:17:54,257
Well, I should go, too.

436
00:17:54,935 --> 00:17:55,992
Wait, wait. Wait, wait, Sofia.

437
00:17:55,994 --> 00:17:58,128
We got to talk about what
you said in the kitchen.

438
00:17:58,130 --> 00:17:59,596
Oh. Did I say something?

439
00:17:59,598 --> 00:18:01,264
(laughs softly) I don't remember.

440
00:18:03,035 --> 00:18:04,167
Well, not if I see you first.

441
00:18:04,169 --> 00:18:06,603
- (laughs)
- Sofia!

442
00:18:06,605 --> 00:18:08,538
Okay, I'm sorry.

443
00:18:08,540 --> 00:18:10,206
I shouldn't have said anything, okay?

444
00:18:10,208 --> 00:18:13,109
Y-You're going to Italy with
your girlfriend, and what I said

445
00:18:13,111 --> 00:18:15,345
- was really inappropriate...
- Come here.

446
00:18:16,982 --> 00:18:18,848
Finally.

447
00:18:18,850 --> 00:18:20,116
(sniffles)

448
00:18:20,118 --> 00:18:21,184
Fawz, are you crying?

449
00:18:21,186 --> 00:18:23,219
Shut up, you're crying.

450
00:18:26,425 --> 00:18:28,525
Look, I'm not going to Italy.

451
00:18:28,527 --> 00:18:30,560
A-And you ain't moving your truck.

452
00:18:30,562 --> 00:18:32,328
And there's a strong chance
I'm gonna kiss you again,

453
00:18:32,330 --> 00:18:34,197
so just watch the suit;
It's got needles on it,

454
00:18:34,199 --> 00:18:35,799
- all right? So...
- Okay.

455
00:18:38,904 --> 00:18:41,104
So who wants to catch a brother up?

456
00:18:45,677 --> 00:18:48,611
So, uh, thank you
for walking me to work.

457
00:18:48,613 --> 00:18:49,746
Mm.

458
00:18:49,748 --> 00:18:51,414
I'm gonna miss you.

459
00:18:51,416 --> 00:18:52,415
I'm gonna miss you, too.

460
00:18:53,253 --> 00:18:54,584
So when am I gonna see you again?

461
00:18:54,586 --> 00:18:55,919
Every time you turn around.

462
00:18:55,921 --> 00:18:58,354
She works right out there.

463
00:18:58,356 --> 00:18:59,522
(laughs)

464
00:18:59,524 --> 00:19:00,590
- All right.
- Okay.

465
00:19:00,592 --> 00:19:02,859
Bye.

466
00:19:03,962 --> 00:19:05,595
Whoa, what's going on?

467
00:19:05,597 --> 00:19:08,231
I'm not going to Italy no more,
man, so I can keep my job here.

468
00:19:08,233 --> 00:19:11,234
We'll see if we can work you
into the schedule, cowboy.

469
00:19:14,005 --> 00:19:15,505
Arthur, here is the paperwork.

470
00:19:15,507 --> 00:19:17,941
It was a pleasure doing
business with you.

471
00:19:17,943 --> 00:19:19,609
(chuckles) What's he talking about?

472
00:19:19,611 --> 00:19:21,745
I sold him the shop.

473
00:19:21,747 --> 00:19:23,646
- You what?
- TUSH: What?

474
00:19:23,648 --> 00:19:25,415
Just like that?

475
00:19:25,417 --> 00:19:27,484
FRANCO:
If this is about me going to Italy, man,

476
00:19:27,486 --> 00:19:30,191
- I ain't going no more, I'm staying here.
- I didn't do this because of you, kid.

477
00:19:30,289 --> 00:19:32,655
That robbery, it opened my eyes.

478
00:19:32,657 --> 00:19:35,191
I-I've got to get out
there and live my life.

479
00:19:35,193 --> 00:19:37,393
I'm gonna finally take that road trip.

480
00:19:37,395 --> 00:19:40,864
I'm gonna see the three states
that Joanie and I never got to.

481
00:19:40,866 --> 00:19:43,867
So...

482
00:19:43,869 --> 00:19:46,069
Excuse me.

483
00:19:49,107 --> 00:19:51,074
So who am I working for?

484
00:19:51,858 --> 00:19:54,277
You may call me Mr. Al-Shahrani.

485
00:19:56,848 --> 00:19:58,414
Hell no.

486
00:20:00,352 --> 00:20:02,452
That's it?
You're just gonna leave me here?

487
00:20:02,454 --> 00:20:03,753
No, I'll be back. (Laughs): Hey.

488
00:20:03,755 --> 00:20:05,488
I'm gonna still live upstairs.

489
00:20:05,490 --> 00:20:07,123
It's not the same.

490
00:20:07,125 --> 00:20:08,691
Well, maybe things
shouldn't be the same.

491
00:20:08,693 --> 00:20:11,561
I mean, if they were,
you wouldn't be in art school,

492
00:20:11,563 --> 00:20:13,229
and you wouldn't have Sofia.

493
00:20:13,896 --> 00:20:16,599
Hey, come on, you're always
pushing me to live my life.

494
00:20:17,406 --> 00:20:18,768
So I'm gonna do it.

495
00:20:22,906 --> 00:20:24,574
Okay, man.

496
00:20:27,412 --> 00:20:29,846
(laughs softly)

497
00:20:29,848 --> 00:20:31,781
Stay in touch, all right?

498
00:20:32,342 --> 00:20:33,657
Text me once in a while.

499
00:20:33,692 --> 00:20:34,150
Sure.

500
00:20:34,152 --> 00:20:36,352
If you show me how again.

501
00:20:40,525 --> 00:20:42,058
FAWZ: Franco,

502
00:20:42,060 --> 00:20:45,028
don't worry,
your job at Superior Donuts is safe.

503
00:20:45,030 --> 00:20:46,162
Thanks, Fawz.

504
00:20:46,164 --> 00:20:49,365
Until I turn this shop into
something more upscale, where,

505
00:20:49,367 --> 00:20:51,768
let's be honest,
you probably won't be "the right fit."

506
00:20:51,770 --> 00:20:53,436
(chuckles)

507
00:20:53,891 --> 00:20:54,671
So,

508
00:20:54,673 --> 00:20:56,472
let's get to work, you're on the clock.

509
00:20:56,474 --> 00:20:59,776
Chop-chop! (Chuckles)

510
00:21:00,489 --> 00:21:02,679
Arthur, take me with you!

511
