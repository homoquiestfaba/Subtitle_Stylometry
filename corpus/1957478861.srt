00:14:27,470 --> 00:14:31,970
OH, AND MERRY CHRISTMAS.

350
00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:38,980
JINGLE. JANGLE.

351
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:40,480
WHAT'S UP, DOC?

352
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:41,980
[WHISTLING TUNE]

353
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:44,480
Santa: NAUGHTY OR NICE?
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN ANYMORE?

354
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:47,990
AND I DEFY ANYBODY
TO FIND ME ONE CHILD

355
00:14:47,990 --> 00:14:51,990
THAT REALLY CARES ABOUT
THE TRUE SPIRIT OF CHRISTMAS.

356
00:14:51,990 --> 00:14:54,990
OH, YOU'RE JUST TIRED.

357
00:14:54,990 --> 00:14:57,500
YEAH. I'M TIRED.

358
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:59,000
TIRED OF CHRISTMAS.

359
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,000
WELL, YOU'LL FEEL BETTER
AFTER YOU GET SOME REST.

360
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,500
YOU'RE RIGHT.

361
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:06,010
REST IS WHAT I NEED.

362
00:15:06,010 --> 00:15:08,510
REST IF WHAT I'M GONNA GET.

363
00:15:08,510 --> 00:15:10,510
CALL THE ELVES.

364
00:15:10,510 --> 00:15:12,010
TELL 'EM TO CANCEL
CHRISTMAS.

365
00:15:12,010 --> 00:15:15,010
THIS IS GOING TO BE
A YEAR WITHOUT SANTA CLAUS.

366
00:15:17,020 --> 00:15:18,520
MAN!

367
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:21,520
IF SANTA SKIPS CHRISTMAS,
WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN TO US?

368
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:22,520
I GOT A COUSIN
WHO'S A DENTIST

369
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:24,520
ON THE ISLAND
OF MISFIT TOYS.

370
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:26,530
MAYBE HE COULD USE
A COUPLE OF ASSISTANTS.

371
00:15:26,530 --> 00:15:28,030
WE GOT TO DO
SOMETHING, MAN.

372
00:15:28,030 --> 00:15:29,530
AND THAT'S IT?

373
00:15:29,530 --> 00:15:33,030
WELL, IT'S DOING
SOMETHING, ISN'T IT?

374
00:15:33,030 --> 00:15:36,540
SANTA NEEDS TO ACCEPT
THE FACT THAT HIS NEGATIVE

375
00:15:36,540 --> 00:15:38,540
THOUGHTS ARE CREATING
THEIR OWN REALITY.

376
00:15:38,540 --> 00:15:41,040
SANTA NEEDS TO CHANGE
HIS WAY OF THINKING.

377
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:42,540
WHERE DID THAT
COME FROM?

378
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:45,050
DR. LAURA.
TV'S FAVORITE THERAPIST.

379
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:47,050
WHAT DO YOU DO
WHEN SOMEBODY YOU LOVE,

380
00:15:47,050 --> 00:15:49,550
SOMEBODY YOU CARE ABOUT,
SOMEBODY YOU RESPECT

381
00:15:49,550 --> 00:15:52,050
HAS LOST THEIR SENSE OF
PURPOSE IN LIFE,

382
00:15:52,050 --> 00:15:54,550
AND THE ONLY THOUGHTS
THEY'RE HAVING ARE NEGATIVE?

383
00:15:54,550 --> 00:15:58,560
YOUR JOB IS TO TRY TO
HELP THEM BACK ON TRACK.

384
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:01,060
SO, GO DO THE RIGHT THING.

385
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:03,060
DR. LAURA.

386
00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:04,560
NICE HAIR.

387
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:06,570
YOU KNOW WHAT COULD
CHANGE SANTA'S THINKING?

388
00:16:06,570 --> 00:16:07,570
A REAL LITTLE
EARTH BOY

389
00:16:07,570 --> 00:16:09,070

SPIRIT.

390
00:16:09,070 --> 00:16:11,570
I WONDER WHERE WE GET
ONE OF THOSE.

391
00:16:12,570 --> 00:16:13,570
HOW'D I DO?

392
00:16:13,570 --> 00:16:15,080
WELL, YOU KEEP
THAT UP, KID,

393
00:16:15,070 --> 00:16:16,580
AND YOU CAN BE
A SLICK POLITICIAN

394
00:16:16,580 --> 00:16:18,080
JUST LIKE YOUR FATHER.

395
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:19,080
NOW, IF YOU'LL
EXCUSE ME.

396
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:21,580
I GOT A TOXIC SPILL
TO COVER.

397
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:26,090
I GOT ABOUT 20 MINUTES.
I GOT TO GO.

398
00:16:26,090 --> 00:16:27,590
I'LL SEE YOU.
HEY, IGSTER.

399
00:16:27,590 --> 00:16:28,590
WHERE YOU GOING, DAD?

400
00:16:28,590 --> 00:16:29,590
I GOT TO GET BACK
TO THE HOUSE AND MEET

401
00:16:29,590 --> 00:16:31,090
WITH THOSE
NEW YORK GUYS.

402
00:16:31,090 --> 00:16:32,590
THAT WAS A GREAT STORY
FOR SOUTH TOWN, SON.

403
00:16:32,590 --> 00:16:33,590
BUT I THOUGHT WE WERE
GOING TO WORK

404
00:16:33,590 --> 00:16:35,100
IN THE BOOTH TOGETHER.

405
00:16:35,090 --> 00:16:37,100
WELL, SORRY, IGSTER, BUT
THIS MEETING CAME UP.

406
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:38,100
IT'S AN EMERGENCY.

407
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:39,100
WELL, CAN'T YOU
PUT IT OFF?

408
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:40,600
NO. I'M AFRAID NOT.

409
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:42,600
IGGY UNDERSTANDS.
DON'T YOU, SON?

410
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:44,100
AFTER ALL, I'M NOT
JUST YOUR DAD.

411
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:46,110
YOU'RE THE MAYOR, TOO.

412
00:16:46,110 --> 00:16:47,610
THAT'S MY BOY.

HEY, HOW ARE YOU?

415
00:16:51,610 --> 00:16:53,610
IGGY, YOU KNOW YOUR DAD.

416
00:16:53,610 --> 00:16:56,620
SOMETIMES HE JUST MAKES
PROMISES HE CAN'T KEEP.

417
00:16:56,620 --> 00:16:58,620
HE USED TO KEEP THEM.

418
00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:01,120
HEY, HOW ABOUT IF I STAY
AND HELP YOU BUILD THE BOOTH?

419
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:02,620
THAT'S OK.
I CAN HANDLE IT.

420
00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:04,120
OK. WELL, IN THAT CASE,

421
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:06,130
I'M GONNA GO DO
SOME CHRISTMAS SHOPPING.

422
00:17:06,130 --> 00:17:08,130
I CAN'T LEAVE IT ALL
UP TO SANTA CLAUS.

423
00:17:08,130 --> 00:17:10,130
SANTA CLAUS IS JUST
KID'S STUFF.

424
00:17:10,130 --> 00:17:13,130

TO GO TO SCHOOL, HON.

A VERY NICE HOUSE.

HAVING US OVER.

00:17:33,150 --> 00:17:35,150
I SAW YOUR SON ON TV.
YOU MUST BE PROUD.

430
00:17:35,150 --> 00:17:36,660
I SURE AM.

431
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:40,160

SEEMS TO UNDERSTAND SOUTH TOWN.

HE WANTS TO GROW UP

433
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:43,160

OUR PROBLEMS.

AND WE WANT TO WORK
WITH YOU.

OF OUR RETAIL CENTER

WE DO THIS RIGHT.

SOUTH TOWN TO BECOME?

SOMETHING THAT'S GONNA WORK?

WAS A BLESSING
IN DISGUISE.

00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:40,750
HOW DO YOU FIGURE?

458
00:18:40,750 --> 00:18:42,260
WELL, WE GOT
THE BRAND-NEW TOY LINE

459
00:18:42,250 --> 00:18:44,260

A LOT OF TOYS TO BUILD

460
00:18:44,260 --> 00:18:45,760
AND DELIVER, YOU KNOW.

GENIUS MIGRAINE.

00:18:50,260 --> 00:18:51,260
I HAVE AN IDEA.

464
00:18:51,260 --> 00:18:52,770
WHAT'S THAT?

465
00:18:52,770 --> 00:18:55,770
WHAT IF WE POSTPONED
OR RESCHEDULED...

466
00:18:55,770 --> 00:18:59,270

CHRISTMAS IN JULY?

468
00:19:01,270 --> 00:19:02,780
I KNOW. I KNOW.
I KNOW!

469
00:19:02,780 --> 00:19:03,780
THAT'S WHAT I SAID.

470
00:19:03,780 --> 00:19:05,280
I LITERALLY SAID
THAT TO MYSELF.

471
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:07,780
I SAID,
"CHRISTMAS IN JULY?"

472
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:09,280
BUT THEN I ASKED MYSELF,

473
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:11,780
"WHY DOES CHRISTMAS
ALWAYS HAVE TO BE

474
00:19:11,780 --> 00:19:14,290
ON DECEMBER 25th?"

475
00:19:14,290 --> 00:19:16,790
WHAT IS SO GREAT ABOUT
THAT DATE ANYWAY?

476
00:19:16,790 --> 00:19:18,790
PLUS, A CHRISTMAS IN JULY
IS MUCH MORE FAIR

477
00:19:18,790 --> 00:19:21,290
FOR THOSE OF US WITH A BIRTHDAY
IN LATE DECEMBER.

478
00:19:21,290 --> 00:19:23,800
AND I'M SORRY,
BUT A SINGLE PRESENT

479
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:25,800
FOR BOTH BIRTHDAY
AND CHRISTMAS?

480
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:27,300
THAT IS RIDICULOUS.

481
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:29,800
WE ARE NOT
RESCHEDULING CHRISTMAS.

482
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:31,800
LOOK, I FEEL AS BADLY
ABOUT SANTA AS YOU DO.

483
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:34,310
I REALLY DO, BUT THINGS
HAVE CHANGED.

484
00:19:34,310 --> 00:19:37,310
NOW, NOW I HAVE TO DEAL
WITH THE FACTS

485
00:19:37,310 --> 00:19:38,810
ON THE GROUND, OK?

486
00:19:38,810 --> 00:19:41,310
AND THE FACTS ARE:
SANTA'S IN BED,

487
00:19:41,310 --> 00:19:42,820
COVERS OVER HIS HEAD,

488
00:19:42,820 --> 00:19:44,820

HE'LL GET OVER IT.

490
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:47,820
I HOPE SO.

491
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:48,820
BUT I'D BE LYING
TO MYSELF IF I SAID

492
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:50,320
I DIDN'T SEE
THIS COMING.

493
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:51,820
AND I DON'T LIE.
I TRIED THAT.

494
00:19:51,820 --> 00:19:53,330
IT DOESN'T WORK FOR ME.

WITH THE TIMES.

501
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:05,840
OK. I SEE WHAT
YOU'RE SAYING.

502
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:08,340
BUT WHAT DO WE DO TO GET
SANTA TO MOVE WITH THE TIMES?

503
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:09,840

504
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:11,840
BECAUSE I'VE BEEN
WORKING ON THIS WHOLE

SOMETHING THAT WILL

506
00:20:13,350 --> 00:20:14,350
UPDATE HIS IMAGE AND GET

AGAIN, OK?

HOME OR A CEMETERY?

701
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:55,230
WHO SENT YOU THIS?

702
00:29:55,230 --> 00:29:56,730
ABE.

703
00:29:56,730 --> 00:29:58,230
THE ABOMINABLE
SNOWMAN LIVES HERE?

704
00:29:58,230 --> 00:29:59,730
YEP.

705
00:29:59,730 --> 00:30:03,240
WHEN PEOPLE STOPPED
CHASING HIM, HE GOT BORED.

706
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:05,240
NOW HE'S A SNOWMAN
OF LEISURE.

707
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:08,240
MYTHOPOLIS,
THE SENIOR COMMUNITY

708
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:10,740
DESIGNED WITH THE MATURE
MYTH IN MIND.

709
00:30:10,740 --> 00:30:13,250
HELLO, I'M HERCULES.

710
00:30:13,250 --> 00:30:14,750
AND IF YOU'RE LIKE ME,

711
00:30:14,750 --> 00:30:17,250
YOUR DAYS OF KILLING
9-HEADED HYDRO MONSTERS

712
00:30:17,250 --> 00:30:18,250
ARE BEHIND YOU.

713
00:30:18,250 --> 00:30:20,250
NOW IT'S TIME TO ENTER
A WHOLE NEW WORLD

714
00:30:20,250 --> 00:30:22,760
OF FUN AND EXCITEMENT.

715
00:30:22,750 --> 00:30:24,260
SO COME IN, OLD FRIEND.

716
00:30:24,260 --> 00:30:26,760
THE FUN'S JUST GETTING STARTED.

717
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:28,260
HEY, BLUE.

718
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:35,270
IT'S A PLACE WHERE OLD FABLES
CAN FEEL FABULOUS AGAIN.

719
00:30:35,270 --> 00:30:37,770
YOU HAVING FUN, MEDUSA?

720
00:30:37,770 --> 00:30:39,770
ABSOLUTELY,
YOU STUD MUFFIN.

721
00:30:39,770 --> 00:30:41,770
OH, MAN.

722
00:30:41,770 --> 00:30:43,280
OUT OF THIS WORLD FUN.

723
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:44,780
HERE AT MYTHOPOLIS.

724
00:30:44,780 --> 00:30:45,780
FORGET IT.

725
00:30:45,780 --> 00:30:47,280
I WOULD RATHER
JUMP OFF THE DIVIDE

726
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:48,780
THAN MOVE
TO MYTHOPOLIS.

727
00:30:48,780 --> 00:30:51,780
COME ON, BABY.
IT LOOKS LIKE FUN.

728
00:30:51,780 --> 00:30:54,290
ALL OF OUR FRIENDS
ARE THERE.

729
00:30:54,290 --> 00:30:56,790
YOU HAVE FRIENDS HERE
WHO NEED YOU.

730
00:30:56,790 --> 00:30:59,790
YEAH? TO SIGN
THEIR PAYCHECKS!

731
00:30:59,790 --> 00:31:02,790
THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS
WHEN YOU BECOME A CORPORATION.

732
00:31:07,300 --> 00:31:12,810
YOU'LL FEEL 3,000 YEARS YOUNG
WHEN YOU MOVE TO MYTHOPOLIS.

733
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:14,310
1, 2, 3, 4.

734
00:31:14,310 --> 00:31:17,310
[GIGGLES]

735
00:31:18,810 --> 00:31:21,310
$5.00!

736
00:31:21,310 --> 00:31:22,310
I HOPE IT'S AS GOOD
AS THE CANDY WE USUALLY GET

737
00:31:22,310 --> 00:31:23,820
AT THE NORTH POLE.

738
00:31:23,820 --> 00:31:25,320
I BET IT AIN'T.

739
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:26,820
VIXEN!

740
00:31:31,820 --> 00:31:33,330
NOW WHAT WE GONNA DO?

741
00:31:33,330 --> 00:31:34,330
I DON'T KNOW.

742
00:31:34,330 --> 00:31:36,330
MAN, MAYBE WE'RE IN
OVER OUR HEADS.

743
00:31:36,330 --> 00:31:39,330
WE CAN CALL SPARKY.
HE'D KNOW WHAT TO DO.

744
00:31:39,330 --> 00:31:40,330
HE'LL BE FURIOUS.

745
00:31:40,330 --> 00:31:41,830
NOT AS FURIOUS
AS THE BIG GUY

746
00:31:41,830 --> 00:31:43,340
IF WE DON'T GET
VIXEN BACK.

747
00:31:43,340 --> 00:31:45,340
WE SHOULD CALL SPARKY.

748
00:31:45,340 --> 00:31:46,840
NOT DR. LAURA?

749
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:47,840
COME ON.

750
00:31:57,350 --> 00:31:59,350
JINGLE, STOP.

751
00:31:59,350 --> 00:32:00,350
THIS IS A CRIME SCENE.

752
00:32:00,350 --> 00:32:03,360
YOU COULD BE DESTROYING
VALUABLE FORENSIC EVIDENCE.

753
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:04,860
HMM...

754
00:32:04,860 --> 00:32:07,360
WHAT EXACTLY IS
FORENSIC EVIDENCE?

755
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:12,870
WHERE'S MY STUFF

756
00:32:12,860 --> 00:32:14,370
AND OUR MAP?

757
00:32:14,370 --> 00:32:16,370
AND THE SANTA
CELL PHONE?

758
00:32:16,370 --> 00:32:18,870
WE REALLY ARE
A COUPLE OF E.T.s

759
00:32:18,870 --> 00:32:20,370
THAT CAN'T PHONE HOME.

760
00:32:20,370 --> 00:32:21,370
E.T.s?

761
00:32:21,370 --> 00:32:24,880
ELF TYPES.

762
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:27,380
WE REALLY GOT TO FIND
THAT IGGY.

763
00:32:27,380 --> 00:32:29,380
YEAH. MAYBE HE CAN
HELP US.

764
00:32:38,390 --> 00:32:41,390
CLOP? WHERE ARE
JINGLE AND JANGLE?

765
00:32:41,390 --> 00:32:42,900
UH, THEY WENT
ICE FISHING.

766
00:32:42,890 --> 00:32:44,400
WHERE?

767
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:46,400
THE ICE?

768
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:48,400
NOW, WHY WOULD
THEY GO AND DO THAT

769
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:49,900
WITHOUT TELLING ME?

770
00:32:49,900 --> 00:32:51,400
I KNOW. THAT IS
JUST SO RUDE.

771
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:52,910
I MEAN, WHO DO
THEY THINK THEY ARE?

772
00:32:52,900 --> 00:32:54,910
TALK.

773
00:32:54,910 --> 00:32:57,910
THEY MADE ME PROMISE
NOT TO SQUEAL.

774
00:32:57,910 --> 00:32:59,910
I DON'T KNOW
WHERE THEY WENT.

775
00:32:59,910 --> 00:33:01,910
ALL I KNOW IS THEY TOOK
A MAP OF THE DIVIDE WITH THEM.

776
00:33:01,910 --> 00:33:03,920
THE DIVIDE?

777
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:06,420
YOU DON'T PASS OVER
THE DIVIDE, UNLESS...

778
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:14,930
WHAT MAKES YOU THINK
WE'RE GONNA FIND HIM HERE?

779
00:33:14,930 --> 00:33:16,430
'CAUSE THIS IS A SCHOOL.

780
00:33:16,430 --> 00:33:18,930
THIS IS WHERE KIDS
HANG OUT ALL DAY.

781
00:33:18,930 --> 00:33:19,930
YOU NEVER SEEN
"SOUTH PARK"?

782
00:33:19,930 --> 00:33:23,440
WELL, HOW LONG DO
THEY KEEP 'EM HERE?

783
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:25,440
ABOUT 7 HOURS.

784
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:26,940
REALLY? WHAT DO THEY
PAY 'EM FOR GOING TO SCHOOL?

785
00:33:26,940 --> 00:33:28,940
NOTHING.
NOT A DIME.

786
00:33:28,940 --> 00:33:31,440
WELL, NO WONDER THERE'S
NO CHRISTMAS SPIRIT.

787
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:32,950
Boy: HEY, DO YOU WANT
TO GO THROW SOME BALLS AROUND?

788
00:33:32,940 --> 00:33:34,950
SORRY. I'M GOING TO
TOKEN TOWN WITH TOMMY.

789
00:33:34,950 --> 00:33:36,450
OH, COOL. I WAS JUST
THERE YESTERDAY.

790
00:33:36,450 --> 00:33:38,450
THERE HE IS.
THERE'S IGGY.

791
00:33:38,450 --> 00:33:39,450
REALLY?
WHAT'D YOU WIN?

792
00:33:39,450 --> 00:33:40,950
NOTHING, BUT I'M
SAVING UP MY TICKETS.

793
00:33:40,950 --> 00:33:42,450
OH.
SEE YA.

794
00:33:42,450 --> 00:33:43,960
BYE.

795
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:44,960
IGGY!

796
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:48,960
KIDS. WE'RE TWO ELVES
FROM THE NORTH POLE.

797
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:51,460
[LAUGHS]
YEAH, RIGHT.

798
00:33:51,460 --> 00:33:52,460
NO, REALLY, WE ARE.

799
00:33:52,460 --> 00:33:53,470
PROVE IT.

800
00:33:53,470 --> 00:33:54,470
YOU ASKED FOR IT.

801
00:33:54,470 --> 00:33:55,970
NO. DON'T.

802
00:33:55,970 --> 00:33:57,470
EXTREME CIRCUMSTANCES
CALL FOR EXTREME MEASURES.

803
00:34:02,470 --> 00:34:04,480
POINTED EARS ARE THE MARK OF
A TRUE CHRISTMAS ELF.

804
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:05,980
FEW MORTALS HAVE
EVER SEEN THEM.

805
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:09,980
COME ON.
BIG DEAL.

806
00:34:09,980 --> 00:34:11,480
JOSH'S OLDER BROTHER
PIERCED HIS EARS

807
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:13,490
WITH A CROWBAR.

808
00:34:15,990 --> 00:34:17,490
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

809
00:34:17,490 --> 00:34:18,990
WE'RE HERE BECAUSE
WE NEED TO FIND A KID

810
00:34:18,990 --> 00:34:21,490
THAT BELIEVES THE TRUE
SPIRIT OF CHRISTMAS.

811
00:34:21,490 --> 00:34:24,500
IF WE DON'T, IT'LL BE
A YEAR WITHOUT SANTA CLAUS.

812
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:26,500
SANTA CLAUS?

813
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:28,000
I THINK YOU TWO
ARE LOOKING FOR

814
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,500
THE PRESCHOOL.

815
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:32,000
NO. WE'RE LOOKING
FOR YOU.

816
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,510
I SAW YOU ON TV
TALKING ABOUT SANTA CLAUS.

817
00:34:34,510 --> 00:34:37,010
SO, ARE YOU READY
TO MEET SANTA?

818
00:34:37,010 --> 00:34:39,510
I WOULD BE, EXCEPT
I DON'T BELIEVE

819
00:34:39,510 --> 00:34:41,010
IN SANTA CLAUS.

820
00:34:41,010 --> 00:34:43,520
HOW CAN YOU NOT BELIEVE
IN SANTA CLAUS?

821
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:45,020
HE'S TOO YOUNG
TO THINK SO OLD.

822
00:34:45,020 --> 00:34:46,520
Boy: HEADS UP!

823
00:34:52,020 --> 00:34:54,530
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

824
00:34:54,530 --> 00:34:56,030
WE'RE NOT SUPPOSED
TO LET PEOPLE SEE US

825
00:34:56,030 --> 00:34:57,030
BREAK THE LAWS OF
THE PHYSICAL WORLD.

826
00:34:57,030 --> 00:34:58,530
SO YOU'RE ELVES THAT
ESCAPED FROM THE CIRCUS.

827
00:34:58,530 --> 00:35:00,030
BIG DEAL.

828
00:35:00,030 --> 00:35:02,030
HEY! DO YOU TWO HAVE
PERMISSION

829
00:35:02,030 --> 00:35:03,540
TO BE HERE? HEY!
STRANGER DANGER.

830
00:35:03,540 --> 00:35:05,040
STRANGER DANGER.

831
00:35:06,540 --> 00:35:08,040
WHAT ARE YOU GAWKING AT?

832
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:10,040
YOU'RE A GREEK
GODDESS, AREN'T YOU?

833
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:11,040
ISN'T THAT
A SALAD DRESSING?

834
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:12,540
SHUT UP.

835
00:35:12,540 --> 00:35:14,550
I TRY TO HIDE
MY RADIANCE UNDER

836
00:35:14,550 --> 00:35:17,050
THESE SPORTY ENSEMBLES,
BUT SOMETIMES

837
00:35:17,050 --> 00:35:18,550
IT JUST SHINES THROUGH.

838
00:35:18,550 --> 00:35:22,550
I'M ARTEMIS,
PROTECTOR OF YOUTH.

839
00:35:22,550 --> 00:35:24,560
HARDLY ANYBODY
BELIEVES IN ME ANYMORE.

840
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:26,560
SO, NOWADAYS I PROTECT
YOUTH FREELANCE.

841
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:30,060
SCHOOL.
PLAYGROUND LEVEL.

842
00:35:32,060 --> 00:35:33,570
WHAT'S WRONG WITH
ALL THE KIDS AROUND HERE?

843
00:35:33,570 --> 00:35:34,570
THEY DON'T BELIEVE
IN ANYTHING--

844
00:35:34,570 --> 00:35:36,070
NOT EVEN SANTA CLAUS.

845
00:35:36,070 --> 00:35:37,570
ALL PEOPLE BELIEVE
IN NOWADAYS IS

846
00:35:37,570 --> 00:35:38,570
MATERIAL THINGS.

847
00:35:38,570 --> 00:35:40,570
IF THEY CAN'T SEE IT
OR BUY IT,

848
00:35:40,570 --> 00:35:42,070
IT DOESN'T EXIST
TO THEM.

849
00:35:42,070 --> 00:35:44,080
I GUESS WE'LL HAVE TO
KEEP HAMMERING AWAY AT IGGY

850
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:46,080
UNTIL HE SEES THE MAGIC
OF CHRISTMAS IS REAL.

851
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:49,080
YOU WORK OUT?
YOU LOOK LIKE YOU WORK OUT.

852
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:51,080
HELLO.

853
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:53,080
STOP MACKING
AND STACKING, MAN.

854
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:54,090
HE'S GONE.

855
00:35:54,090 --> 00:35:56,090
TRYING TO MAKE BOOTY CALLS
ON THE CLOCK.

856
00:35:56,090 --> 00:35:57,590
THAT'S TOO MUCH...

857
00:35:57,590 --> 00:36:01,090
IGGY! HEY, IGGY.

858
00:36:01,090 --> 00:36:02,590
I DON'T TALK
TO STRANGERS.

859
00:36:02,590 --> 00:36:04,100
YOU KNOW, THAT'S
A GOOD RULE USUALLY,

860
00:36:04,100 --> 00:36:06,100
BUT WE'RE NOT
STRANGERS; WE'RE ELVES.

861
00:36:06,100 --> 00:36:08,100
I ALSO DON'T TALK TO GUYS
WHO THINK THEY'RE ELVES.

862
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:12,100
I WOULD LOVE
TO BELIEVE IN SANTA,

863
00:36:12,100 --> 00:36:15,110
BUT I ONLY BELIEVE IN
THINGS I CAN SEE AND TOUCH.

864
00:36:15,110 --> 00:36:18,110
REALLY? HEY, YOU SEE
A SUNSET, TOUCH A PUPPY.

865
00:36:18,110 --> 00:36:20,610
YEAH, AND I CAN SEE
A SUNSET AND TOUCH A PUPPY.

866
00:36:20,610 --> 00:36:22,610
BAD EXAMPLE.

867
00:36:22,610 --> 00:36:24,120
LOOK, WE SAW YOU
TALKING ON TV

868
00:36:24,120 --> 00:36:26,120
ABOUT YOUR CHRISTMAS FESTIVAL
AND HOW YOU WANTED

869
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:28,620
TO BRING CHRISTMAS SPIRIT
BACK TO SOUTH TOWN.

870
00:36:28,620 --> 00:36:31,620
WELL, SANTA CLAUS NEEDS
YOUR CHRISTMAS SPIRIT.

871
00:36:31,620 --> 00:36:33,630
I GOTTA GO, GUYS.
EVERYONE'S WAITING FOR ME.

872
00:36:33,630 --> 00:36:34,630
WHERE YOU GOTTA GO?

873
00:36:34,630 --> 00:36:36,130
A PARTY AT TOKEN TOWN.

874

CHOP SUEY?

1569
01:06:56,280 --> 01:06:57,780
YOU AND I ARE GONNA
RAISE SOME SERIOUS MONEY

1570
01:06:57,780 --> 01:07:00,280
FOR THAT SOUTH TOWN
ENDOWMENT, OK?

1571
01:07:00,280 --> 01:07:01,280
OK.

1572
01:07:01,280 --> 01:07:04,290
OK. I'M GONNA GO GET
THE REST OF THE PIES.

1573
01:07:04,290 --> 01:07:06,290
I'LL SEE YOU BACK HERE
SHORTLY.

1574
01:07:07,790 --> 01:07:09,790
IGGY...

1575
01:07:09,790 --> 01:07:11,290
YES, MOM?

1576
01:07:11,290 --> 01:07:13,800
YOU KNOW THAT YOUR DAD
IS VERY PROUD OF YOU.

1577
01:07:23,310 --> 01:07:25,310
YOU OK, IGGY?

1578
01:07:25,310 --> 01:07:27,810
I'VE ALWAYS
LOVED CHRISTMAS,

1579
01:07:27,810 --> 01:07:29,310
BECAUSE I KNEW THAT
MY MOM AND DAD AND I

1580
01:07:29,310 --> 01:07:31,310
WOULD ALWAYS
BE TOGETHER.

1581
01:07:31,310 --> 01:07:33,320
BUT, AS MY DAD BECAME
MORE IMPORTANT,

1582
01:07:33,320 --> 01:07:36,320
HE NEVER SEEMED TO HAVE
TIME FOR CHRISTMAS ANYMORE.

1583
01:07:37,820 --> 01:07:39,820
HE EVEN WORKS ON CHRISTMAS
DAY SOMETIMES.

1584
01:07:39,820 --> 01:07:42,330
YOU KNOW, IGGY.
I THINK I UNDERSTAND.

1585
01:07:42,330 --> 01:07:45,330
SOMETIMES EVEN I FORGET
HOW IMPORTANT CHRISTMAS

1586
01:07:45,330 --> 01:07:47,330
IS TO PEOPLE.

1587
01:07:47,330 --> 01:07:48,330
REALLY?

1588
01:07:48,330 --> 01:07:49,830
YEP.

1589
01:07:52,340 --> 01:07:53,840
I USED TO THINK
I WAS TOO OLD

1590
01:07:53,840 --> 01:07:55,840
TO BELIEVE IN
SANTA CLAUS.

1591
01:07:55,840 --> 01:07:58,840
NOW I THINK I'M TOO OLD
NOT TO BELIEVE.

1592
01:07:58,840 --> 01:08:03,850
IGGY, WHAT DO YOU WANT
FOR CHRISTMAS THIS YEAR?

1593
01:08:03,850 --> 01:08:05,850
YOU DON'T HAVE TO GET
ME ANYTHING, SANTA.

1594
01:08:05,850 --> 01:08:09,350
OH, I OWE YOU FOR TAKING
CARE OF MY ELVES.

1595
01:08:09,350 --> 01:08:10,850
BIG TIME.

1596
01:08:10,850 --> 01:08:14,860
NOW, WHAT DO YOU REALLY WANT
FOR CHRISTMAS THIS YEAR?

1597
01:08:19,360 --> 01:08:22,370
I'D LIKE YOU TO MAKE IT
SNOW HERE IN SOUTH TOWN.

1598
01:08:22,370 --> 01:08:25,370
SNOW?

1599
01:08:25,370 --> 01:08:26,870
NOT JUST SNOW,

1600
01:08:26,870 --> 01:08:28,870
BUT TONS OF SNOW.

1601
01:08:28,870 --> 01:08:32,380
I THINK I UNDERSTAND.

1602
01:08:32,380 --> 01:08:34,380
IT'S NOT YOUR USUAL
CHRISTMAS WISH,

1603
01:08:34,380 --> 01:08:37,380
BUT IT CAME FROM
THE HEART.

1604
01:08:37,380 --> 01:08:38,380
I'LL SEE
WHAT I CAN DO, IGGY.

1605
01:08:45,220 --> 01:08:47,220
[SNORING]

1606
01:08:52,230 --> 01:08:53,730
YAH!

1607
01:08:53,730 --> 01:08:55,730
HO HO HO HO HO!

1608
01:08:58,740 --> 01:09:02,240
WELL, WELL, WELL.
IF IT ISN'T SANTY CLAUS?

1609
01:09:02,240 --> 01:09:03,740
SHOULDN'T YOU BE OFF
DOING ANOTHER COMMERCIAL

1610
01:09:03,740 --> 01:09:05,240
FOR MY BROTHER?

1611
01:09:05,240 --> 01:09:06,240
YOU KNOW I NEVER TAKE

1612
01:09:06,240 --> 01:09:08,240
SIDES BETWEEN YOU
AND SNOW MISER.

1613
01:09:08,240 --> 01:09:09,250
OH, COME ON.

1614
01:09:09,250 --> 01:09:10,750
TRAIPSING AROUND
IN THAT SLEIGH OF YOURS,

1615
01:09:10,750 --> 01:09:12,250
STIRRING UP COLD
WINTER BREEZES,

1616
01:09:12,250 --> 01:09:14,250
MAKING EVERYBODY THINK
FONDLY OF ICE HOCKEY

1617
01:09:14,250 --> 01:09:17,250
AND SNOW BALL FIGHTS
AND SLEIGH RIDES.

1618
01:09:17,250 --> 01:09:18,760
I CAN ASSURE YOU IT'S
TOTALLY UNINTENTIONAL.

1619
01:09:18,760 --> 01:09:21,760
WHY CAN'T YOU SING
THE PRAISES OF SUNSTROKE

1620
01:09:21,760 --> 01:09:22,760
AND HEAT PROSTRATION?

1621
01:09:22,760 --> 01:09:24,760
I'LL SEE WHAT I CAN DO
ABOUT IT.

1622
01:09:24,760 --> 01:09:26,260
MEANWHILE, I CAME
TO ASK YOU A FAVOR.

1623
01:09:26,260 --> 01:09:27,760
I DON'T SEE WHY I SHOULD.

1624
01:09:27,760 --> 01:09:30,270
NOBODY EVER DOES
ANYTHING FOR ME.

1625
01:09:30,270 --> 01:09:32,270
YOU ALL LIKE MY BROTHER
BETTER ANYWAYS.

1626
01:09:32,270 --> 01:09:34,270
NO, THAT'S NOT TRUE.

1627
01:09:34,270 --> 01:09:37,270
MOST OF THE TIME I CAN'T
STAND EITHER OF YOU.

1628
01:09:37,270 --> 01:09:38,270
BUT LISTEN,
THIS IS IMPORTANT.

1629
01:09:38,270 --> 01:09:39,780
ALL RIGHT.
I'M LISTENING.

1630
01:09:39,780 --> 01:09:41,280
I NEED YOU TO TURN THE
HEAT DOWN IN SOUTH TOWN

1631
01:09:41,280 --> 01:09:43,280
SO YOUR BROTHER CAN
MAKE IT SNOW THERE.

1632
01:09:43,280 --> 01:09:44,280
WHAT?!

1633
01:09:44,280 --> 01:09:45,280
SNOW IN THE DEEP SOUTH?

1634
01:09:45,280 --> 01:09:46,780
NEVER!

1635
01:09:46,780 --> 01:09:48,290
HAVEN'T THE MORTALS MESSED
WITH THE WEATHER ENOUGH?

1636
01:09:48,280 --> 01:09:50,790
WHY SHOULD I HELP THEM
SCREW IT UP MORE?

1637
01:09:50,790 --> 01:09:52,290
I'LL MAKE IT WORTH
YOUR WHILE.

1638
01:09:52,290 --> 01:09:53,790
MMM...

1639
01:09:53,790 --> 01:09:54,790
REMEMBER A CHRISTMAS
WISH YOU MADE

1640
01:09:54,790 --> 01:09:56,290
WHEN YOU WERE
A LITTLE KID

1641
01:09:56,290 --> 01:09:57,790
AND I WOULDN'T
GIVE IT TO YOU?

1642
01:09:57,790 --> 01:09:59,800
THE FLAME THROWER?

1643
01:09:59,800 --> 01:10:01,300
NO. NOT THE FLAME THROWER.

1644
01:10:03,300 --> 01:10:06,800
THE LITTLE ISOTOPE
NUCLEAR REACTOR KIT?

1645
01:10:06,800 --> 01:10:09,310
NO, NO, NO, NO.
THINK NORTH POLE.

1646
01:10:10,810 --> 01:10:13,810
FOR ONE WHOLE DAY

1647
01:10:13,810 --> 01:10:15,810
THE WEATHER IN
THE NORTH POLE

1648
01:10:15,810 --> 01:10:18,320
BELONGS TO ME.

1649
01:10:18,310 --> 01:10:22,320
A SLIMY, STANKIN',
SMELLY SUMMER'S DAY.

1650
01:10:22,320 --> 01:10:25,320
ELVES SLATHERED
IN SUNBLOCK.

1651
01:10:25,320 --> 01:10:27,320
OF COURSE, WE NEED
SNOW MISER'S PERMISSION.

1652
01:10:27,320 --> 01:10:30,830
WHY DON'T WE GIVE
THAT TOOTY FRUITY

1653
01:10:30,830 --> 01:10:33,330
SNOW CONE A BUZZ
ON MY HOTLINE,

1654
01:10:33,330 --> 01:10:34,830
SEE WHAT HE SAYS?

1655
01:10:37,830 --> 01:10:39,340
SNOW MISER.

1656
01:10:39,340 --> 01:10:41,340
SANTA CLAUS HERE.

1657
01:10:41,340 --> 01:10:42,840
HI, SANTA.

1658
01:10:42,840 --> 01:10:44,340
HOW'D YOU MAKE OUT
WITH THE HOT HEAD?

1659
01:10:44,340 --> 01:10:46,840
HEY, I HEARD THAT,
YOU SNOWBALL.

1660
01:10:46,840 --> 01:10:48,350
MIND YOUR BLOOD PRESSURE,
HOT CAKES.

1661
01:10:48,340 --> 01:10:50,350
MOTHER WARNED YOU ABOUT
THE LOW BOILING POINT OF YOURS.

1662
01:10:50,350 --> 01:10:52,350
YOU THINK YOU SO HOT,

1663
01:10:52,350 --> 01:10:54,350
JUST 'CAUSE MAMA
LIKE YOU BEST.

1664
01:10:54,350 --> 01:10:55,850
ENOUGH ALREADY!

1665
01:10:55,850 --> 01:10:57,850
SNOW MISER, YOUR BROTHER'S
AGREED TO TURN DOWN

1666
01:10:57,850 --> 01:11:00,860
THE HEAT AT SOUTH TOWN
SO YOU CAN MAKE IT SNOW THERE.

1667
01:11:00,860 --> 01:11:02,360
WHAT?

1668
01:11:02,360 --> 01:11:05,360
OF COURSE, THERE'D BE
A SMALL CONCESSION.

1669
01:11:05,360 --> 01:11:07,860
WHAT DID THAT FLAMING FOOL
WANT THIS TIME--THE NORTH POLE?

1670
01:11:07,860 --> 01:11:09,370
[CHUCKLES]

1671
01:11:09,370 --> 01:11:11,870
AS A MATTER OF FACT,
THAT HAPPENS TO BE

1672
01:11:11,870 --> 01:11:13,370
THE SMALL CONCESSION
I ASKED FOR.

1673
01:11:13,370 --> 01:11:14,870
WHAT?!

1674
01:11:14,870 --> 01:11:16,370
YOU SEE, I TOLD YOU
HE WOULDN'T COOPERATE.

1675
01:11:16,370 --> 01:11:17,870
COOPERATE?

1676
01:11:17,870 --> 01:11:19,880
THE VERY THOUGHT MAKES
THE BLOOD RUN COLD IN MY VEINS.

1677
01:11:19,880 --> 01:11:20,880
YEAH, WELL,
IT'S ENOUGH

1678
01:11:20,880 --> 01:11:22,880
TO BOIL
MY BRAIN CELLS.

1679
01:11:22,880 --> 01:11:24,880
ALL RIGHT, THAT'S IT!
YOU TWO BEHAVE YOURSELVES

1680
01:11:24,880 --> 01:11:26,880
OR I'M GONNA CALL
YOUR MOTHER RIGHT NOW!

1681
01:11:26,880 --> 01:11:28,390
OOH!

1682
01:11:28,380 --> 01:11:30,390
NO. NOT MOMMY.

1683
01:11:30,390 --> 01:11:32,390
ALL RIGHT, THEN.
DO WE HAVE A DEAL?

1684
01:11:32,390 --> 01:11:34,890
Sparky: GIVE ME SOME ROOM.
GIVE ME SOME ROOM!

1685
01:11:38,390 --> 01:11:40,900
THIS IS GONNA BE
A CHRISTMAS EVE TO REMEMBER.

1686
01:11:42,900 --> 01:11:45,400
THE DAWN OF A NEW ERA.

1687
01:11:45,400 --> 01:11:48,400
ONE BIG STEP FOR MANKIND.

1688
01:11:48,400 --> 01:11:50,910
THE AGE OF AQUARIUS.

1689
01:11:50,910 --> 01:11:54,910
NOTHING BETTER GO WRONG
OR HEADS WILL ROLL!

1690
01:11:54,910 --> 01:11:57,910
SPARKY, HAVE YOU
SEEN SANTA?

1691
01:11:57,910 --> 01:11:59,920
WHAT THE HECK IS
GOING ON HERE?

1692
01:11:59,920 --> 01:12:01,420
HALLOWEEN.

1693
01:12:01,420 --> 01:12:02,420
EARLY.

1694
01:12:02,420 --> 01:12:06,920
IT'S EXTREME SANTA.
I TOLD YOU ALL ABOUT IT.

1695
01:12:06,920 --> 01:12:07,920
OW!

1696
01:12:07,920 --> 01:12:10,430
AND I TOLD YOU THAT
SANTA IS FLYING TONIGHT.

1697
01:12:10,430 --> 01:12:13,430
HE IS?
OH. I'M SORRY.

1698
01:12:13,430 --> 01:12:14,430
MY BAD.

1699
01:12:14,430 --> 01:12:15,930
OH, WAIT.
I JUST REMEMBERED.

1700
01:12:15,930 --> 01:12:16,930
HE'S NOT HERE.

1701
01:12:16,930 --> 01:12:18,940
HE'S FISHING FOR ELVES.

1702
01:12:18,940 --> 01:12:22,440
AND THAT MEANS THE CEO CAN
DECIDE WHO DELIVERS THE TOYS

1703
01:12:22,440 --> 01:12:23,940
TO ALL THE GOOD
LITTLE GIRLS AND BOYS.

1704
01:12:23,940 --> 01:12:27,440
AND WAIT A SECOND HERE.
YEP. THAT WOULD BE MOI.

1705
01:12:27,440 --> 01:12:29,950
DO YOU WANT
TO BREAK HIS HEART?

1706
01:12:29,950 --> 01:12:31,450
ARE YOU CRAZY?

1707
01:12:31,450 --> 01:12:33,450
THAT IS THE LAST THING
I EVER WANT TO DO.

1708
01:12:33,450 --> 01:12:34,950
I JUST WANT THERE
TO BE A CHRISTMAS.

1709
01:12:34,950 --> 01:12:37,450
HE HAD HIS CHANCE.
NOW IT'S MY TURN.

1710
01:12:37,450 --> 01:12:39,460
IF YOU'D LIKE TO SPEAK
TO MY LAWYER ABOUT IT,

1711
01:12:39,460 --> 01:12:42,960
I'M SURE HE CAN
EXPLAIN IT TO YOU!

1712
01:12:42,960 --> 01:12:44,460
HE'S RIGHT, MRS. CLAUS.

1713
01:12:44,460 --> 01:12:45,460
IN THE ABSENCE OF
SANTA CLAUS,

1714
01:12:45,460 --> 01:12:47,460
SPARKY IS LEGALLY ENTITLED
TO TAKE OVER.

1715
01:12:47,460 --> 01:12:48,970
NOW, I'LL HAVE A COPY
OF "THE NORTH POLE PROTOCOLS

1716
01:12:48,970 --> 01:12:50,470

WHERE ARE YOU,
YOU OLD GOAT?

1721
01:13:19,500 --> 01:13:21,000
WE NEED YOU.

1722
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:23,500

THEY'RE GATHERING TO WISH ME
GOOD LUCK AND GODSPEED.

WHATEVER YOU DO,
DO NOT LET ME CRY, OK?

1730
01:13:47,520 --> 01:13:49,030
I DO NOT WANT
TO GET CROW'S FEET.

1731
01:13:49,030 --> 01:13:51,030

IT'S ALREADY BEING CALLED
THE MIRACLE OF SOUTH TOWN.

1913
01:23:31,810 --> 01:23:35,810
MOST REMARKABLE IS THAT
SNOW'S ONLY FALLING HERE.

THERE'S NO REPORT OF SNOWFALL
ANYWHERE ELSE IN THE REGION.

THEORY ABOUT WHERE

THE SNOWSTORM CAME FROM.

THE SNOWSTORM CAME FROM?

I KNOW EXACTLY
WHERE IT CAME FROM.
