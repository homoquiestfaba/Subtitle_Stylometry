00:00:31,732 --> 00:00:34,168
NARRATOR: My name is Aaron,
and the study of man's past

3
00:00:34,268 --> 00:00:36,270
Has always fascinated me.

4
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:39,607
So much so that I made
it my life's work.

5
00:00:39,707 --> 00:00:42,710
You see, I've always had this
desire to shape the way we look

6
00:00:42,810 --> 00:00:46,547
At our past because our lives
seem so short... like we're just

7
00:00:46,647 --> 00:00:48,949
So many points of
light, fighting it out

8
00:00:49,049 --> 00:00:51,885
Within some vast
and utter darkness.

9
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:14,842
It all started
peacefully enough.

10
00:01:14,942 --> 00:01:18,246
I'd earned a postgraduate
scholarship in history,

11
00:01:18,346 --> 00:01:20,548
And was working as a
general teaching assistant

12
00:01:20,648 --> 00:01:22,583
For the summer schedule.

13
00:01:22,683 --> 00:01:24,652
Earlier that morning,
I was informed

14
00:01:24,752 --> 00:01:27,321
That one of our faculty
had suffered a stroke.

15
00:01:27,421 --> 00:01:29,990
At the time, I was
really excited.

16
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:34,061
All my hopes and dreams,
once far off and frustrated,

17
00:01:34,162 --> 00:01:38,432
Now seemed possible,
provable, within reach.

18
00:01:38,532 --> 00:01:40,901
My main goal in life
was to solve the mystery

19
00:01:41,001 --> 00:01:43,003
Surrounding America's
first documented,

20
00:01:43,103 --> 00:01:45,339
Tried and convicted cannibal.

21
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:47,975
The man I had based my
entire master's thesis

22
00:01:48,075 --> 00:01:50,411
And professional career around.

23
00:01:50,511 --> 00:01:53,447
In life, his name
was Alferd Packer.

24
00:02:03,357 --> 00:02:05,993
In death, as in life,
great controversy

25
00:02:06,093 --> 00:02:08,196
Always surrounded Packer.

26
00:02:08,296 --> 00:02:11,232
Even on his headstone, a
misguided mason's sense

27
00:02:11,332 --> 00:02:13,267
For proper English
misspelled his name

28
00:02:13,367 --> 00:02:16,437
As Alfred for all eternity.

29
00:02:16,537 --> 00:02:19,039
But many skeptics,
including myself,

30
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:21,742
Questioned if it
really was Packer dead

31
00:02:21,842 --> 00:02:23,944
And buried there in that grave.

32
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:34,755
Packer journeyed into
Colorado at the height

33
00:02:34,855 --> 00:02:36,957
Of the Gold Rush ear.

34
00:02:37,057 --> 00:02:39,092
As a kid growing up
back there, I'd heard

35
00:02:39,193 --> 00:02:41,329
Many ghost stories about him.

36
00:02:41,429 --> 00:02:45,333
In the winter of 1874, he
led an ill-fated expedition

37
00:02:45,433 --> 00:02:48,402
Of gold miners into
Slumgullion Pass, where

38
00:02:48,502 --> 00:02:51,171
He killed and ate all
of them, before stealing

39
00:02:51,272 --> 00:02:53,607
Away with their gold.

40
00:02:53,707 --> 00:02:55,509
Packer was caught, trying
to cash in his stolen

41
00:02:55,609 --> 00:02:58,546
Gold at an Indian trading
post, but he claimed

42
00:02:58,646 --> 00:03:02,049
He knew the whereabouts of a
huge motherload for the West,

43
00:03:02,149 --> 00:03:06,287
And vowed that no jail
could keep him from it.

44
00:03:06,387 --> 00:03:08,256
One night, he vanished.

45
00:03:08,356 --> 00:03:10,658
The story was, they
brought back the wrong man

46
00:03:10,758 --> 00:03:12,626
Who took the blame for
Packer, but was eventually

47
00:03:12,726 --> 00:03:15,529
Even pardoned by the governor.

48
00:03:15,629 --> 00:03:17,598
I thought if there was
any truth to these tales,

49
00:03:17,698 --> 00:03:20,401
I'd be able to chart the
ancient path of his travelings

50
00:03:20,501 --> 00:03:23,804
By researching the archivals
of various county coronorers,

51
00:03:23,904 --> 00:03:25,205
Due west of Colorado.

52
00:03:25,306 --> 00:03:27,475
You see, Packer
allegedly murdered

53
00:03:27,575 --> 00:03:29,977
My great-great grandfather
on his way west,

54
00:03:30,077 --> 00:03:32,079
And I eventually
was able to track

55
00:03:32,179 --> 00:03:34,248
Down old gramps' gravesite.

56
00:03:34,348 --> 00:03:37,618
I figured I'd like to
do the same for Packer.

57
00:03:37,718 --> 00:03:40,488
No one knew exactly
where he had ended up,

58
00:03:40,588 --> 00:03:42,723
But I was determined
to find out the truth.

59
00:03:45,893 --> 00:03:48,529
I did my research mostly
by facts, and a modem

60
00:03:48,629 --> 00:03:50,264
To my computer.

61
00:03:50,364 --> 00:03:53,301
Finally, I found a nearly
complete ring of locations

62
00:03:53,401 --> 00:03:55,303
About five miles
in circumference

63
00:03:55,403 --> 00:03:59,106
Near a place called Miller's
Pass in Southern California.

64
00:03:59,206 --> 00:04:00,841
With a little more
documentation,

65
00:04:00,941 --> 00:04:05,178
I could ensure myself academic
fame and tenure for life.

66
00:04:05,279 --> 00:04:08,582
But some of the tales I heard
seemed more than far-fetched.

67
00:04:08,682 --> 00:04:11,785
They were on a scale that was
almost biblical in proportion,

68
00:04:11,885 --> 00:04:14,388
And they really made me laugh.

69
00:04:14,488 --> 00:04:17,090
Especially the one about
Packer meeting the devil down

70
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:20,928
In those deep, dark mine shafts
where they made a blood pact...

71
00:04:21,028 --> 00:04:24,031
A pact that allowed
Packer keep his soul,

72
00:04:24,131 --> 00:04:29,370
Live forever, and own more
gold than he could have spend.

73
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:33,674
Well, like many deals, it wasn't
all that it seemed at first,

74
00:04:33,774 --> 00:04:36,209
And it went badly for Packer.

75
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:38,145
Being so close to
the gates of hell,

76
00:04:38,245 --> 00:04:40,213
The devil took him
there for a short visit,

77
00:04:40,314 --> 00:04:42,082
Where he crucified him.

78
00:04:42,182 --> 00:04:44,618
After that, according
to the legend,

79
00:04:44,718 --> 00:04:48,689
He put what was left of Packer
back on Earth, doomed to hunger

80
00:04:48,789 --> 00:04:52,326
Only for human flesh,
and the gold in the earth

81
00:04:52,426 --> 00:04:56,830
Forever... or at least
until judgment day.

82
00:04:56,930 --> 00:05:00,534
After all, a deal's a deal.

83
00:05:00,634 --> 00:05:02,836
Since I knew the professor
wouldn't be coming back

84
00:05:02,936 --> 00:05:05,739
That semester, I figured
I'd surprise the class

85
00:05:05,839 --> 00:05:07,875
With a new assignment,
and be on the trail

86
00:05:07,975 --> 00:05:09,242
Before anyone could object.

87
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:20,153
This is Miller's
Pass, and this was

88
00:05:20,253 --> 00:05:24,191
Alferd Packer, just before his
infamous mining extradition.

89
00:05:24,291 --> 00:05:26,126
Many claim they
caught the wrong man.

90
00:05:36,504 --> 00:05:40,774
And then, in 1890...
Along a 20-mile stretch

91
00:05:40,874 --> 00:05:44,111
Of canyons and
deserts, a new darkness

92
00:05:44,211 --> 00:05:45,379
Spread across the land.

93
00:05:51,952 --> 00:05:57,825
The land was turned
into a graveyard.

A killing ground for
a savage murderer,

96

Who dispatched his victims with
one powerful blow of a pick.

00:06:42,970 --> 00:06:45,806
Described as a monster,
a pure force of evil,

been seen again to this day.

over 40 men and women

During his reign of terror.

The deranged miner's
insatiable appetite for blood

lust for gold, vowing he

We would never let his body
be laid to rest till he

104

Had struck the mother load.

105
00:07:06,694 --> 00:07:07,728
Any questions?

106
00:07:10,998 --> 00:07:14,568
Yeah, I got a question.

107
00:07:14,668 --> 00:07:15,903

down just a tad, huh?

You know, when I was in school
and I was having a hard time

to set my alarm for 3 o'clock

In the morning.

163

I'd get up, go out on the porch
at my dorm, and just sit there,

178
00:14:14,654 --> 00:14:16,456
Come on, you guys.

179
00:14:16,556 --> 00:14:17,390
[Booming]

180
00:14:17,490 --> 00:14:20,227
What the hell is that sound?

181
00:14:20,327 --> 00:14:25,198
This trip isn't about books or
graphs, or about taking notes.

182
00:14:25,298 --> 00:14:27,167
It's about getting
out of the classroom,

183
00:14:27,267 --> 00:14:29,869
Getting away from the computer.

184
00:14:29,970 --> 00:14:32,039
Getting out here.

185
00:14:32,139 --> 00:14:34,741
You know?

186
00:14:34,841 --> 00:14:38,078
Experiencing things first-hand.

187
00:14:38,178 --> 00:14:42,015
Sharing things with others,
sharing your observations.

188
00:14:42,115 --> 00:14:44,151
HOLLY: Well, looks like I'm
going to have to do it myself.

189
00:14:44,251 --> 00:14:44,952
Weasels.

190
00:15:04,972 --> 00:15:07,140
No one talks anymore.

191
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:08,141
How's this?

192
00:15:58,358 --> 00:15:59,059
VOICE: Help!

193
00:15:59,159 --> 00:16:00,060
I'm down here!

194
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:02,029
Help!

195
00:16:02,129 --> 00:16:05,532
Please, help me, please,
somebody, I'm down here!

196
00:16:05,632 --> 00:16:07,034
Please help me!

197
00:16:07,134 --> 00:16:08,535
I'm down here, please!

198
00:16:08,635 --> 00:16:11,038
I'm down here, somebody
help me, I'm trapped!

199
00:16:11,138 --> 00:16:13,006
Down here!

200
00:16:13,106 --> 00:16:14,507
Someone help me, please!

201
00:16:19,612 --> 00:16:20,513
Help me, please!

202
00:16:43,070 --> 00:16:45,438
Please help me!

203
00:16:45,538 --> 00:16:47,440
He's coming, help me!

204
00:16:53,546 --> 00:16:54,947
He's coming, help me!

205
00:16:55,048 --> 00:16:56,416
Please, please, he's coming!

206
00:17:05,024 --> 00:17:06,926
[Screaming]

207
00:17:32,452 --> 00:17:34,354
[Screaming]

208
00:17:55,908 --> 00:17:56,809
Goose behind you!

209
00:17:59,979 --> 00:18:02,048
You little creep.

210
00:18:02,149 --> 00:18:03,516
Mom gets harder.

211
00:18:03,616 --> 00:18:05,518
Move that.

212
00:18:05,618 --> 00:18:06,819
Cut it out, I'll smack you.

213
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:07,620
Cut it out.

214
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:08,621
Hey, stop screwing around.

215
00:18:08,721 --> 00:18:09,422
What?

216
00:18:09,522 --> 00:18:10,390
Yeah, right.

217
00:18:10,490 --> 00:18:11,958
She started it.

218
00:18:12,058 --> 00:18:12,959
Big puss.

219
00:18:16,496 --> 00:18:18,865
You got crap on your back.

220
00:18:18,965 --> 00:18:19,832
Cut it out.

221
00:18:55,368 --> 00:18:56,068
Wow.

222
00:19:02,642 --> 00:19:03,676
Hey, you guys.

223
00:19:03,776 --> 00:19:05,077
Look at this bone?

224
00:19:05,178 --> 00:19:07,514
Yeah, Laura, remind
you of anything?

225
00:19:13,553 --> 00:19:14,254
Howdy.

226
00:19:23,796 --> 00:19:26,966
You're trespassing, boy.

227
00:19:27,066 --> 00:19:29,269
Yeah, we were just on
our way to Miller's Pass,

228
00:19:29,369 --> 00:19:31,070
Do a little prospecting.

229
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:33,506
You look more like
city folk, to me.

230
00:19:33,606 --> 00:19:35,141
Lost your way.

231
00:19:35,242 --> 00:19:37,510
We thought we could
spend the night here.

232
00:19:40,847 --> 00:19:44,183
Warm weather brings your kind.

233
00:19:44,284 --> 00:19:46,953
Mostly undesirables.

234
00:19:47,053 --> 00:19:50,490
You're not much better
than the trash you leave.

235
00:19:50,590 --> 00:19:52,359
Well, you won't have
any... any sort of problem

236
00:19:52,459 --> 00:19:55,662
Like that with us, sir.

237
00:19:55,762 --> 00:19:56,763
I know I won't.

238
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:07,540
Ah, look, if you're
going to spend the night,

239
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:09,476
There's one thing I
want to warn you about.

240
00:20:13,613 --> 00:20:17,984
A long time ago, there
was a field hospital here,

241
00:20:18,084 --> 00:20:22,054
And they took every precaution
to fix people up and send

242
00:20:22,154 --> 00:20:24,691
Them back to work in the mine.

243
00:20:24,791 --> 00:20:29,061
At one time there was this
guy, he had gallstone problem,

244
00:20:29,161 --> 00:20:32,665
So they figured they take out
the gallstones right here.

245
00:20:32,765 --> 00:20:35,968
So just before
they put him under,

246
00:20:36,068 --> 00:20:39,272
They figured, they just tell
him, you know, reassure him,

247
00:20:39,372 --> 00:20:41,674
OK, he's going to be all right.

248
00:20:41,774 --> 00:20:43,310
OK, he was fine.

249
00:20:43,410 --> 00:20:44,311
He went under.

250
00:20:44,411 --> 00:20:49,882
And after the
surgery, guy came to.

251
00:20:49,982 --> 00:20:54,921
And they told him he had a very
successful liver operation.

252
00:20:55,021 --> 00:20:59,626
Well, he was so upset,
he went instantly crazy.

253
00:20:59,726 --> 00:21:02,495
He was supposed to have
his gallstones out.

254
00:21:02,595 --> 00:21:05,965
And this guy, got up
off the operating table.

255
00:21:06,065 --> 00:21:09,436
He just looked around, he
killed everybody in the room.

256
00:21:09,536 --> 00:21:12,439
And he just ran out of room.

257
00:21:12,539 --> 00:21:13,606
Nobody saw him again.

258
00:21:16,309 --> 00:21:20,112
But after that, the patients
in some of the other tents,

259
00:21:20,212 --> 00:21:24,951
They could swear the flap of
the tent would just open up,

260
00:21:25,051 --> 00:21:28,120
And they'd see an image
of somebody coming in,

261
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:32,124
Come over and start to peel
back the sheets a little bit.

262
00:21:32,224 --> 00:21:36,295
And all they could hear is
somebody saying, my liver!

263
00:21:36,396 --> 00:21:37,697
I want my liver!

264
00:21:37,797 --> 00:21:41,167
Where's my liver!

265
00:21:41,267 --> 00:21:42,835
[Laughing]

266
00:21:43,736 --> 00:21:46,105
They fell for it!

267
00:21:46,205 --> 00:21:48,608
They fell for it!

268
00:21:48,708 --> 00:21:50,643
Oh, god, you fell for it.

269
00:21:50,743 --> 00:21:52,645
Everyone one of you fell for it.

270
00:21:52,745 --> 00:21:53,880
Hey, you know what?

271
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:55,548
I had a lot of fun.

272
00:21:55,648 --> 00:21:57,316
You know what?

273
00:21:57,417 --> 00:22:00,219
Let me see if I can work up
a good puss pocket for you.

274
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:01,888
No, listen, listen...
Have you ever heard

275
00:22:01,988 --> 00:22:04,691
Of the legend of Alferd Packer?

276
00:22:04,791 --> 00:22:05,758
Alferd Packer?

277
00:22:05,858 --> 00:22:08,027
What do you want to
know about him for?

278
00:22:08,127 --> 00:22:10,363
Hey... what's with you anyway?

279
00:22:10,463 --> 00:22:11,731
You're not prospectors.

280
00:22:11,831 --> 00:22:14,601
You came up here looking for
something else, didn't you?

281
00:22:14,701 --> 00:22:16,936
No, no, no... I just heard
that he was buried up here.

282
00:22:17,036 --> 00:22:19,906
Uh-uh... no, uh-uh.

283
00:22:20,006 --> 00:22:22,575
You go messing with the dead,
you go messing with Packer,

284
00:22:22,675 --> 00:22:23,910
You're in trouble.

285
00:22:24,010 --> 00:22:24,811
I mean it.

286
00:22:24,911 --> 00:22:25,878
Something bad's going to happen.

287
00:22:25,978 --> 00:22:27,279
No, it's not that at all.

288
00:22:27,380 --> 00:22:29,181
It's just that one of us last
night, traveling in our party,

289
00:22:29,281 --> 00:22:31,918
Said she saw a
light, or something.

290
00:22:32,018 --> 00:22:34,053
And we can't find her now.

291
00:22:34,153 --> 00:22:34,854
[Inaudible]

292
00:22:34,954 --> 00:22:36,489
No, uh-uh.

293
00:22:36,589 --> 00:22:37,289
Forget it.

294
00:22:37,390 --> 00:22:39,692
She's as good as dead.

295
00:22:39,792 --> 00:22:40,960
She's probably dead by now.

296
00:22:41,060 --> 00:22:43,362
The same thing's going to
happen to you... or worse.

297
00:22:43,463 --> 00:22:44,897
Just get out of here.
Get off my land.

298
00:22:44,997 --> 00:22:45,798
I mean, get all your stuff.

299
00:22:45,898 --> 00:22:47,099
Come on, come on, here.

300
00:22:47,199 --> 00:22:48,334
Get this thing.
You, too.

301
00:22:48,435 --> 00:22:49,669
You, too.
Come on.

302
00:22:49,769 --> 00:22:50,470
Get out of here.

303
00:22:50,570 --> 00:22:51,303
There's something wrong.

304
00:22:51,404 --> 00:22:52,605
Just get out of here, I mean it.

305
00:22:52,705 --> 00:22:55,442
Something... oh, you
have no idea the trouble

306
00:22:55,542 --> 00:22:56,576
You've made for yourself!

307
00:22:56,676 --> 00:22:57,477
You have no idea!

308
00:23:12,291 --> 00:23:17,464
Aaron, I thought you said
there was someplace out here

309
00:23:17,564 --> 00:23:18,465
We could get help.

310
00:23:18,565 --> 00:23:20,199
I did.

311
00:23:20,299 --> 00:23:22,702
This is it.

312
00:23:22,802 --> 00:23:24,103
What is it?

313
00:23:24,203 --> 00:23:25,438
This.

314
00:23:25,538 --> 00:23:27,406
I think the answer's here.

315
00:23:27,507 --> 00:23:29,742
Are you joking?

316
00:23:29,842 --> 00:23:32,111
This is not happening.

317
00:23:32,211 --> 00:23:33,112
Holly is gone.

318
00:23:33,212 --> 00:23:34,814
This whole field trip is over.

319
00:23:34,914 --> 00:23:36,048
Don't you think I know that?

320
00:23:36,148 --> 00:23:39,652
Aaron, we have to get to
the police to get some help.

321
00:23:39,752 --> 00:23:42,021
The police are three days back.

322
00:23:42,121 --> 00:23:44,791
Well then, we'd
better start now.

323
00:23:44,891 --> 00:23:47,059
You know, sometimes when
you're out here like this,

324
00:23:47,159 --> 00:23:49,762
You have to rely
on other sources.

325
00:23:49,862 --> 00:23:52,264
What are you trying to say?

326
00:23:52,364 --> 00:23:54,901
This path is sacred ground.

327
00:23:55,001 --> 00:23:57,470
With all your help,
a little luck,

328
00:23:57,570 --> 00:23:58,871
We might be able to
find out some answers

329
00:23:58,971 --> 00:24:01,307
About what happened to Holly.

330
00:24:01,407 --> 00:24:04,110
Well, what are you getting at?

331
00:24:04,210 --> 00:24:05,912
I'm talking about
speaking with the dead.

332
00:24:52,725 --> 00:24:56,563
I'll just wait for
you guys out here.

333
00:24:56,663 --> 00:24:58,230
This is it.

334
00:24:58,330 --> 00:24:59,599
This is it.

335
00:24:59,699 --> 00:25:01,568
All right guys, take your stuff
off, don't bring it in here.

336
00:25:14,614 --> 00:25:15,314
Ooh.

337
00:25:18,885 --> 00:25:20,052
Aaron, what are you doing?

338
00:25:20,152 --> 00:25:23,189
I think he's been out
in the sun too long.

339
00:25:28,628 --> 00:25:32,464
Tara, Tara come here.

340
00:25:32,565 --> 00:25:36,402
It's due west, the color black.

341
00:25:36,502 --> 00:25:38,270
I like black, black's cool.

342
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:39,238
Like we care.

343
00:25:39,338 --> 00:25:41,608
Rebirthing,
transformation, death.

344
00:25:53,853 --> 00:25:58,725
The sign of the east,
stand right here.

345
00:25:58,825 --> 00:26:03,162
Illumination, the rising sun...

346
00:26:03,262 --> 00:26:05,331
I got your rising
sun right here.

347
00:26:05,431 --> 00:26:06,132
Sacred cloud.

348
00:26:09,201 --> 00:26:14,073
Right here, here, right there.

349
00:26:14,173 --> 00:26:15,541
That's it.

350
00:26:15,642 --> 00:26:18,510
It's the sign of the...
Sign of the south.

351
00:26:25,051 --> 00:26:28,921
That will be the north.

352
00:26:29,021 --> 00:26:33,359
Strong noises right here.

353
00:26:33,459 --> 00:26:35,327
OK, all right.

354
00:26:35,427 --> 00:26:38,030
I think we're ready.

355
00:26:38,130 --> 00:26:39,565
Everybody sit down.

356
00:26:39,666 --> 00:26:41,467
In the dirt?

357
00:26:41,567 --> 00:26:43,235
