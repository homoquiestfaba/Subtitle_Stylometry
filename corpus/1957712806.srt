00:01:04,147 --> 00:01:09,069
Fuck.
Man, this is never gonna work.

2
00:01:09,111 --> 00:01:13,156
I don't see a baby.
I see, like, an orange-ish blob.

3
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:18,704
I mean... I don't know,
is it supposed to...?

4
00:01:19,621 --> 00:01:21,081
Penka?

5
00:01:29,715 --> 00:01:31,258
Silvio?

6
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:33,552
SILVIO: Oh, I forgot
your milk, Penka.

7
00:01:33,594 --> 00:01:36,013
Silvio! No, it's not...
Come here now.

8
00:01:36,054 --> 00:01:39,141
- What's up?
- Um...

9
00:01:39,183 --> 00:01:41,435
- What's up?
- I think she... Oh.

10
00:01:42,436 --> 00:01:45,564
What? Penka?

11
00:01:52,154 --> 00:01:53,155
Penka.

12
00:01:53,197 --> 00:01:54,531

- Oh.

16
00:02:14,551 --> 00:02:17,221
Sure. You have
multi-instrumentalist vibes.

17
00:02:17,262 --> 00:02:18,847
- That's why I ask.
- Oh, OK.

18
00:02:18,889 --> 00:02:26,605
My labor was
54 hours and 45 minutes.

19
00:02:26,647 --> 00:02:28,315
Think about
the symmetry of that.

20
00:02:28,357 --> 00:02:29,274
Yeah. Whew.

21
00:02:29,316 --> 00:02:33,070
I mean, after hour 12,
just gimme the epidural.

22
00:02:33,111 --> 00:02:36,490
I mean, it's just, like...
I just wanna be numb, you know?

23
00:02:36,532 --> 00:02:39,201
To be honest, I've been
chipping with the oxies already.

24
00:02:39,243 --> 00:02:41,495
It's my lower back.
It's been killing me.

25
00:02:41,537 --> 00:02:43,389
An oxy here and there's
not gonna hurt the baby.

26
00:02:43,413 --> 00:02:45,123
OK, she's... she's...

27
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:46,959
- She's kidding.
- Oh. (LAUGHS)

28
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,127
- She's kidding.
- No, I'm not.

29

(CHUCKLES)

30
00:02:50,796 --> 00:02:54,091
So have you found a replacement?

31
00:02:54,132 --> 00:02:55,050
WOMAN: A replacement?

32
00:02:55,092 --> 00:02:57,553
- For poor sweet Penka.
- WOMAN: Oh.

33
00:02:57,594 --> 00:02:59,930
Um, well, we did
just kind of talk about

34
00:02:59,972 --> 00:03:01,306
doing a hospital birth.

35
00:03:01,348 --> 00:03:03,433
- Did we, though?
- What?

36
00:03:03,475 --> 00:03:05,519
First of all, slow your roll.

37
00:03:05,561 --> 00:03:08,272
I mean, it's like,
we're pretty far along as it is,

38
00:03:08,313 --> 00:03:10,315
and Penka was kinda
the only person

39
00:03:10,357 --> 00:03:11,692
that I would want to do...

40
00:03:11,733 --> 00:03:13,944
Well, but Penka...
Penka was special.

41
00:03:13,986 --> 00:03:15,696
So special. So special.

42
00:03:15,737 --> 00:03:19,700
Right, but... It doesn't mean
there aren't more...

43
00:03:19,741 --> 00:03:22,452
- other special...
- I think that we're just...

44
00:03:22,494 --> 00:03:24,705
- We're still figuring it out.
- Yeah.

45
00:03:24,746 --> 00:03:28,333
Sounds like you two
are still figuring it out.

46
00:03:40,846 --> 00:03:43,056
- Hi.
- Hi.

47
00:03:45,309 --> 00:03:47,644
Do you know what that is?

48
00:03:49,188 --> 00:03:50,689
Cabbage.

49
00:03:51,899 --> 00:03:53,317
And this one?

50
00:03:54,651 --> 00:03:57,654
- Cabbage again.
- Right.

51
00:03:58,822 --> 00:04:00,949
- A lot of cabbage.
- Hm-hmm.

52
00:04:05,454 --> 00:04:07,497
Boys, can I have
your attention, please?

53
00:04:08,999 --> 00:04:11,585
MAN: Boys? Hi.

54
00:04:15,297 --> 00:04:18,007
Do you know why
everyone's here today?

55
00:04:19,343 --> 00:04:20,928
My mommy died.

56
00:04:22,513 --> 00:04:24,389
Do you remember Penka?

57
00:04:24,431 --> 00:04:26,433
She was there
when you were born.

58
00:04:26,475 --> 00:04:29,478
Her hands were the first
human hands to ever touch you.

59
00:04:31,647 --> 00:04:35,651
Do you know where you were
before you came to this world?

60
00:04:35,692 --> 00:04:39,363
Do you know where you go
when you leave?

61
00:04:39,404 --> 00:04:45,202
You walk, just like Penka,
back over the Rainbow Bridge.

62
00:04:45,244 --> 00:04:49,164
But everyone you leave behind
will stay here

63
00:04:49,206 --> 00:04:51,166
and be very, very sad.

64
00:04:51,208 --> 00:04:54,086
Your mommy, your daddy,

65
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:57,589
everyone you ever loved will be
very sad that you're gone.

66
00:04:57,631 --> 00:05:00,968
And you, Thor, and you, Erik,

67
00:05:01,009 --> 00:05:03,428
you won't be Thor
and you won't be Erik anymore.

68
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:07,099
- Who will we be?
- You'll be nothing.

69
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:08,892
Then your bodies
will burn into dust

70
00:05:08,934 --> 00:05:12,479
and... everything you thought
you were will be no more.

71
00:05:16,483 --> 00:05:17,776
MAN: Hmm.

72
00:05:21,613 --> 00:05:23,282
(MAN CHUCKLES)

73
00:05:27,035 --> 00:05:28,579
What did we call it
when we were kids

74
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:30,747
or what did they call it
in comic books?

75
00:05:32,749 --> 00:05:34,042
X-ray vision, right?

76
00:05:34,084 --> 00:05:39,590
You could see through people's
pants and shirts, right?

77
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:43,177
Superpower.

78
00:05:45,387 --> 00:05:47,723
It's what Penka had.

79
00:05:47,764 --> 00:05:50,893
Those of you who knew her
know what I'm talking about.

80
00:05:50,934 --> 00:05:53,187
Now, by saying that she
could see into this mystery,

81
00:05:53,228 --> 00:05:56,732
am I saying that
she had all the answers? No.

82
00:05:56,773 --> 00:06:00,944
Did she have the ability
to change the outcome? No.

83
00:06:00,986 --> 00:06:03,530
No, she didn't.

84
00:06:03,572 --> 00:06:05,574
Because in the end,

85
00:06:05,616 --> 00:06:08,911
we are all, and can only be,
servants to the will of God

86
00:06:08,952 --> 00:06:11,205
and not even Penka knew that.

87
00:06:12,873 --> 00:06:14,374
Isn't that...

88
00:06:15,542 --> 00:06:18,170
Isn't that beautiful?

89
00:06:18,212 --> 00:06:25,427
That fine line between...
and she, you know?

90
00:06:25,469 --> 00:06:31,767
We can use reason so much to get
to the bottom of things, right?

91
00:06:31,808 --> 00:06:33,602
We wanna be able
to figure it out.

92
00:06:33,644 --> 00:06:36,396
I wanna get to the bottom.
Where's it going? Oh.

93
00:06:38,023 --> 00:06:40,984
Where'd it go?

94
00:06:41,026 --> 00:06:44,571
It's a hundred miles back
that way. It's fucking gone.

95
00:06:44,613 --> 00:06:46,240
It's fucking gone.

96
00:06:53,413 --> 00:06:55,207
You cut down a tree
to see what's inside.

97
00:06:55,249 --> 00:06:56,834
What do you wind up with?

98
00:06:59,753 --> 00:07:01,421
A dead tree, right?

99
00:07:03,006 --> 00:07:05,968
So the tree is a tree.

100
00:07:06,009 --> 00:07:09,805
Penka is Penka.

101
00:07:09,847 --> 00:07:12,683
Let us rejoice in her now
in God's name.

102
00:07:13,851 --> 00:07:15,269
Amen.

(WHISPERS) Who's that?

105
00:07:55,559 --> 00:07:57,394
(WHISPERS) That's Penka's son.

106
00:09:11,301 --> 00:09:12,553
How's school?

107
00:09:12,594 --> 00:09:15,848
- BOY:<i> G-O-O-D.
</i>- Really?

108
00:09:15,889 --> 00:09:17,099
That's not what your mom said.

109
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:19,935
<i>Whatever she tells you, I did
not get sent home from school.</i>

110
00:09:19,977 --> 00:09:22,729
<i>Yes, you did!
You got sent home from school.</i>

111
00:09:22,771 --> 00:09:25,190

</i>- Hi.

112
00:09:25,232 --> 00:09:26,876
WOMAN:<i> Yes, he did
get sent home from school</i>

113
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:28,819
<i>for leaving the classroom
without permission.</i>

114
00:09:28,861 --> 00:09:30,112
Hmm. Will?

115
00:09:30,153 --> 00:09:34,116
- Where are you going?
<i>- I'm getting ice cream. Chill!</i>

116
00:09:34,157 --> 00:09:37,911
Ice cream, really? I mean...

117
00:09:37,953 --> 00:09:40,998
<i>- Whatever.
</i>- How's it going over there?

118
00:09:42,499 --> 00:09:44,877
<i>Will, can you go out back
for a second?</i>

119
00:09:44,918 --> 00:09:47,921
<i>- Why?
- I need to talk to Daddy alone.</i>

120
00:09:47,963 --> 00:09:49,756
Yeah. It's just...
I'd be more comfortable

121
00:09:49,798 --> 00:09:51,216
if you didn't do that.

122
00:09:51,258 --> 00:09:52,301
WOMAN:<i> Do what?</i>

123
00:09:52,342 --> 00:09:54,344
Just the whole,
"I need to talk to Daddy."

124
00:09:54,386 --> 00:09:56,889
Just, "I need to speak
to your father,"

125
00:09:56,930 --> 00:09:58,974
or, "I need to talk
to your dad."

126
00:09:59,016 --> 00:10:00,142
Just... it's better that way

127
00:10:00,184 --> 00:10:02,561
because otherwise, it seems
like we're still together.

128
00:10:02,603 --> 00:10:06,064
<i>- OK.
</i>- Well, don't be mad.

129
00:10:06,106 --> 00:10:08,275
<i>No, it's fine.
We're definitely not together.</i>

130
00:10:08,317 --> 00:10:10,110
So don't... you don't
have to do the thing...

131
00:10:10,152 --> 00:10:12,279
<i>So, did you, um, get a chance</i>

132
00:10:12,321 --> 00:10:15,032
<i>to think
about what we talked about?</i>

133
00:10:15,073 --> 00:10:17,534
- Yeah and, um...
<i>- What did you decide?</i>

134
00:10:17,576 --> 00:10:19,203
<i>Because I've been thinking
about it</i>

135
00:10:19,244 --> 00:10:21,538
<i>and he really needs
his father right now.</i>

136
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:23,123
Totally. There's just
a lot of things

137
00:10:23,165 --> 00:10:24,225
on this side of it, Natasha.

138
00:10:24,249 --> 00:10:26,418
Like, we have to get
a bigger house

139
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:28,086
and the baby's coming soon.

140
00:10:28,128 --> 00:10:30,631
<i>- I know. Exciting.
</i>- Hm-hmm.

141
00:10:31,381 --> 00:10:33,342
<i>The only thing...</i>

142
00:10:33,383 --> 00:10:35,802
<i>I have this yoga retreat
in Tulum</i>

143
00:10:35,844 --> 00:10:38,847
<i>coming up
right around winter break.</i>

144
00:10:38,889 --> 00:10:41,183
OK. So, like, in three months.

145
00:10:41,225 --> 00:10:42,893
<i>Well, right, but I need to book</i>

146
00:10:42,935 --> 00:10:45,270
<i>the plane ticket
and the hotel now.</i>

147
00:10:45,312 --> 00:10:47,564
Oh, I see.

148
00:10:47,606 --> 00:10:50,234
<i>So, can you take him?</i>

149
00:10:52,486 --> 00:10:55,697
Yeah. I mean,
what I was gonna say

150
00:10:55,739 --> 00:10:58,617
was we talked about it and yes,

151
00:10:58,659 --> 00:11:00,369
we can take him.

152
00:11:00,410 --> 00:11:03,330
- And be happy to.
<i>- Really? That's great.</i>

153
00:11:03,372 --> 00:11:06,208
<i>- What are you doing?
</i>- I mean, I think you're right.

154
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:08,544
- He needs his dad.
<i>- I'll start packing his stuff.</i>

155
00:11:08,585 --> 00:11:12,381
- Bye, Will.
<i>- Daddy says, "Bye, Will."</i>

156
00:11:12,422 --> 00:11:13,674
Yeah, seriously. Goodbye.

157
00:11:13,715 --> 00:11:15,509
<i>- Bye.
</i>- Goodbye.

158
00:11:17,094 --> 00:11:18,387
Holy shit!

159
00:11:18,428 --> 00:11:20,305
- Hi.
- Oh, sorry.

160
00:11:20,347 --> 00:11:21,473
I'm Sascha.

161
00:11:21,515 --> 00:11:24,059
People don't usually
come that way.

162
00:11:24,101 --> 00:11:26,019
Just... around the front.

163
00:11:26,061 --> 00:11:28,188
OK, Lev. Bounce pass.
Here he goes.

164
00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:30,315
- OK.
- Layup.

165
00:11:30,357 --> 00:11:32,609
He's coming in hot.
He's coming in hot.

166
00:11:32,651 --> 00:11:34,903
- Yeah!
- Yes!

167
00:11:34,945 --> 00:11:36,822
Yes, all right.
No, Lev. That's good.

168
00:11:36,864 --> 00:11:38,907
If you blow the layup,
don't grab the board.

169
00:11:38,949 --> 00:11:40,784
You just circle back,
you try it again.

170
00:11:40,826 --> 00:11:42,536
- OK.
- You crush.

171
00:11:42,578 --> 00:11:45,205
Madonna, you ready? Bounce pass.

172
00:11:45,247 --> 00:11:47,583
Here she goes,
here she goes, here she goes.

173
00:11:47,624 --> 00:11:48,876
She's up.

174
00:11:48,917 --> 00:11:52,963
- (CHEERING)
- Sick!

175
00:11:53,005 --> 00:11:56,049
WOMAN: Guys, this is so sweet.

176
00:11:56,091 --> 00:11:59,428
But, I mean, I'm really
not gonna be gone for that long.

177
00:11:59,469 --> 00:12:01,346
Like, maybe six months tops.

178
00:12:01,388 --> 00:12:03,891
So I don't really see the reason
for all this cake and shit.

179
00:12:03,932 --> 00:12:06,560
Although,
I do really appreciate it.

180
00:12:06,602 --> 00:12:08,312
Um, I don't know,

181
00:12:08,353 --> 00:12:11,231
maybe some of you guys won't
be here by the time I get back.

182
00:12:11,273 --> 00:12:13,150
I mean, you guys
aren't looking too good.

183
00:12:14,318 --> 00:12:16,778
It's real. Let it sink in.

184
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:19,239
And if that's the case, I do
wanna take this moment to say

185
00:12:19,281 --> 00:12:22,451
that you guys are the best damn
basketball team of octogenarians

186
00:12:22,492 --> 00:12:25,370
that I've ever had the pleasure
to coach.

187
00:12:25,412 --> 00:12:27,557
You guys, just please keep
running your drills and shit.

188
00:12:27,581 --> 00:12:30,626
You're getting good,
really good,

189
00:12:30,667 --> 00:12:33,170
and I'm super proud of you.

190
00:12:36,089 --> 00:12:39,426
God, that is sickly sweet. Lev,
stay away from this stuff, OK?

191
00:12:39,468 --> 00:12:41,345
It's gonna put you
in a diabetic coma, yeah?

192
00:12:41,386 --> 00:12:43,222
I can have a little.

193
00:12:43,263 --> 00:12:45,849
(TYPING)

194
00:12:52,189 --> 00:12:53,690
(SIGHS)

195
00:12:55,234 --> 00:12:57,152
I'm sorry, man, I... I...

196
00:12:57,194 --> 00:13:01,740
I don't know what Deb did with
your mom's, uh, effects, but...

197
00:13:01,782 --> 00:13:04,618
- She'll be back.
- I have nowhere to be.

198
00:13:07,955 --> 00:13:12,042
Did you want a water or a...?
I have water. I have, um...

199
00:13:14,044 --> 00:13:15,629
No, no, no, no. I'm good.

200
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:18,382
SASCHA: I drink a lot of soup.

201
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:23,262
- Yeah, that's not your mom's.
- Are you an artist?

202
00:13:23,303 --> 00:13:25,305
I am, actually,
but that's not...

203
00:13:25,347 --> 00:13:27,391
That's not mine,
that's a Grigor.

204
00:13:27,432 --> 00:13:28,684
But then that...

205
00:13:28,725 --> 00:13:31,061
Yeah. That one is mine.

206
00:13:33,188 --> 00:13:36,108
- Beautiful.
- Thanks.

207
00:13:38,318 --> 00:13:40,988
Yeah, your mom wasn't much of
a reader from what I could tell.

208
00:13:41,029 --> 00:13:44,449
- Books are heavy.
- Yeah, I guess that's true.

209
00:13:44,491 --> 00:13:46,827
Every time I move,
I'm like, "Ugh, the books."

210
00:13:46,869 --> 00:13:49,663
- Do you move a lot?
- No.

211
00:13:55,043 --> 00:13:56,211
Your son?

212
00:13:56,253 --> 00:13:59,047
- Yup, that's Will.
- Does he like Deb?

213
00:13:59,089 --> 00:14:01,633
They haven't met yet,
funnily enough.

214
00:14:01,675 --> 00:14:03,927
Hmm.

215
00:14:03,969 --> 00:14:07,472
- He wasn't born at home, was he?
- No, in a hospital.

216
00:14:07,514 --> 00:14:08,932
How was that?

217
00:14:08,974 --> 00:14:12,644
I wanted a home birth, actually,
but his mother... didn't.

218
00:14:12,686 --> 00:14:16,273
Safety, sanity,
security, sterility.

219
00:14:16,315 --> 00:14:18,609
- Sure.
- Stereotypical. (CHUCKLES)

220
00:14:24,198 --> 00:14:27,409
Sorry. Oh.

221
00:14:27,451 --> 00:14:30,204
Oh, now that.
Yeah, now that<i> is</i> your mom's.

222
00:14:30,245 --> 00:14:32,623
I don't know what it is, though.

223
00:14:32,664 --> 00:14:34,291
Oh.

224
00:14:36,752 --> 00:14:38,879
Is that for, um...

225
00:14:41,548 --> 00:14:44,551
She was almost 50 when she
had me. Did you know that?

226
00:14:46,136 --> 00:14:48,430
She was a whore at the time.

227
00:14:48,472 --> 00:14:50,474
Sex worker, if you like.

228
00:14:50,516 --> 00:14:54,895
Yeah. She was turning tricks
until I was nine.

229
00:14:54,937 --> 00:14:56,355
If you didn't have
a lot of money,

230
00:14:56,396 --> 00:14:58,857
that's just how you got along
at Rajneeshpuram

231
00:14:58,899 --> 00:15:00,692
if you were a woman.

232
00:15:00,734 --> 00:15:03,529
Then she traded in
her hooking boots for these.

233
00:15:05,656 --> 00:15:08,075
I came to it first.

234
00:15:08,116 --> 00:15:11,161
I led her on the path.

235
00:15:11,203 --> 00:15:14,915
There was this girl in camp,
Yamuna.

236
00:15:17,084 --> 00:15:19,044
God, I loved her.

237
00:15:19,086 --> 00:15:21,463
She was pregnant
by her boyfriend Mark

238
00:15:21,505 --> 00:15:23,632
who was facing
several indictments

239
00:15:23,674 --> 00:15:25,384
for cocaine trafficking.

240
00:15:26,552 --> 00:15:28,220
As the summer got hotter

241
00:15:28,262 --> 00:15:31,223
and her belly
grew more round and full,

242
00:15:31,265 --> 00:15:34,393
I found myself by her side
more often than not,

243
00:15:34,434 --> 00:15:38,355
helping her with cleaning
and calisthenics,

244
00:15:38,397 --> 00:15:40,607
whatever was required.

245
00:15:42,568 --> 00:15:47,698
We'd talk all night long
about big subjects,

246
00:15:47,739 --> 00:15:49,783
nature of things.

247
00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:55,956
Then when her time came,
I helped her.

248
00:15:57,374 --> 00:16:01,295
I was only nine years old,
but it was like

249
00:16:01,336 --> 00:16:07,134
my hands were being guided
by some unseen energy.

250
00:16:08,510 --> 00:16:10,137
I can see 'em now like daylight.

251
00:16:10,179 --> 00:16:12,681
My hands moving to her forehead,

252
00:16:12,723 --> 00:16:17,644
down to her belly, reaching
for the neck of the womb.

253
00:16:18,854 --> 00:16:20,856
Opening.

254
00:16:20,898 --> 00:16:27,529
Opening just the same way
the earth cracks and yawns,

255
00:16:27,571 --> 00:16:30,365
revealing her eternity.
(CHUCKLES)

256
00:16:34,119 --> 00:16:36,955
Hours later,
when Penka discovered us

257
00:16:36,997 --> 00:16:40,959
all wrapped up
together under the stars,

258
00:16:41,001 --> 00:16:43,045
she was so moved
by the sight of me

259
00:16:43,086 --> 00:16:45,923
still elbow-deep
in dried sanguine fluid

260
00:16:45,964 --> 00:16:49,134
that... it changed her.

261
00:16:51,470 --> 00:16:54,348
We were known
all over Rajneeshpuram.

262
00:16:54,389 --> 00:16:57,017
The old midwife and her son.

263
00:16:59,353 --> 00:17:02,439
Those were heady days, by God.

264
00:17:02,481 --> 00:17:06,484
Wait. So, so...
<i>you're</i> a midwife?

265
00:17:07,861 --> 00:17:09,445
I'm a doula.

266
00:17:13,534 --> 00:17:14,867
Stay right there.

267
00:17:15,702 --> 00:17:17,287
Uh...

268
00:17:18,829 --> 00:17:20,665
Can I take your picture?

269
00:17:21,583 --> 00:17:23,544
- Yeah.
- (CLEARS THROAT)

270
00:17:23,585 --> 00:17:26,046
- Like this?
- Sure.

271
00:17:31,718 --> 00:17:33,345
(CAMERA CLICKS)

272
00:17:34,972 --> 00:17:38,350
How did you...
How did you know what to do?

273
00:17:38,392 --> 00:17:41,854
How did the baby know
what to do, or Yamuna?

274
00:17:41,895 --> 00:17:45,190
I mean, haven't you ever been
guided by something,

275
00:17:45,232 --> 00:17:46,608
and you just know?

276
00:17:47,651 --> 00:17:49,278
I think so.

277
00:17:58,370 --> 00:18:00,080
You've got a great eye.

278
00:18:00,831 --> 00:18:02,916
(CHUCKLES) Thanks.

279
00:18:11,383 --> 00:18:14,219
(HARMONICA PLAYING)

280
00:18:14,261 --> 00:18:15,721
(GATE SQUEAKS)

281
00:18:43,290 --> 00:18:45,226
You know, we would've made room
for her in the house,

282
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:49,296
but she always insisted
on staying out here.

283
00:18:49,338 --> 00:18:53,383
SASCHA: She swiped it off
a blown-up convoy outside Blaj.

284
00:18:56,011 --> 00:18:58,555
I don't think
she spent a night away from it.

285
00:19:00,182 --> 00:19:03,101
This was her home. (SOBS)

286
00:19:03,143 --> 00:19:07,022
Oh, man. I'm so, so sorry.

287
00:19:07,064 --> 00:19:10,609
Oh, God, I'm embarrassing
myself. I didn't know...

288
00:19:10,651 --> 00:19:13,111
I didn't know being here
would be so hard.

289
00:19:13,153 --> 00:19:17,241
- I should've packed it up.
- Please, please don't.

290
00:19:17,282 --> 00:19:19,326
Just...

291
00:19:19,368 --> 00:19:20,327
I feel like if we take it down,

292
00:19:20,369 --> 00:19:21,954
then that will be
the last of her.

293
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:24,998
She was a great lady.

294
00:19:27,543 --> 00:19:30,420
I really regret taking that job
in Kinshasa.

295
00:19:30,462 --> 00:19:32,339
SILVIO:
Well, you couldn't have known.

296
00:19:33,674 --> 00:19:35,342
She was 90.

297
00:19:38,512 --> 00:19:39,847
Listen.

298
00:19:41,348 --> 00:19:45,227
Why don't you just, you know...
why don't you stay?

299
00:19:45,269 --> 00:19:48,105
No, no. I couldn't.
Not without Deb's approval.

300
00:19:48,146 --> 00:19:50,691
We're actually in a bind here.
We could really use the help.

301
00:19:50,732 --> 00:19:52,985
- You'd be helping us out.
- How far along is she?

302
00:19:53,026 --> 00:19:54,945
She's six weeks out
from her window.

303
00:19:54,987 --> 00:19:55,946
The home stretch.

304
00:19:55,988 --> 00:19:57,507
SILVIO:
You could stay here in the tent,

305
00:19:57,531 --> 00:19:59,074
if you'd be comfortable,
of course.

306
00:19:59,116 --> 00:20:00,909
You know that thing
you just said

307
00:20:00,951 --> 00:20:03,120
about being guided by something?

308
00:20:04,621 --> 00:20:06,540
That's how this feels.

309
00:20:08,125 --> 00:20:09,418
(EXHALES)

310
00:20:12,254 --> 00:20:13,881
- Very well.
- Great.

(LAUGHS)

312
00:20:16,633 --> 00:20:18,427
Do you have a bag or anything?

313
00:20:18,468 --> 00:20:20,470
No. I'll borrow.

314
00:20:20,512 --> 00:20:22,097
OK, I mean,
we have plenty of things.

315
00:20:22,139 --> 00:20:24,641
I mean, we look like
we're about the same size.

00:20:25,976 --> 00:20:27,394

(CLEARS THROAT)

00:20:29,396 --> 00:20:30,939
- How are your erections?
- My...?

320
00:20:30,981 --> 00:20:33,275
- SASCHA: Are you getting them?
- SILVIO: Yeah. No. Yeah.

321
00:20:33,317 --> 00:20:34,610
I was curious because,

322
00:20:34,651 --> 00:20:37,279
uh, my ladies often
say that they need that.

323
00:20:37,321 --> 00:20:39,615
But their guys, they get
a little nervous about it,

324
00:20:39,656 --> 00:20:41,200
especially
in the third trimester.

325
00:20:41,241 --> 00:20:44,036
- SILVIO: Oh, yeah. No, we're...
- SASCHA: No, but it's important.

326
00:20:44,077 --> 00:20:47,206
- ...by stimulating orgasms.
- I did not know that.

327
00:20:47,247 --> 00:20:48,415
Got some shopping in.

328
00:20:48,457 --> 00:20:49,791
- Hey!
- Hi.

329
00:20:49,833 --> 00:20:51,627
- Hi.
- Hello.

330
00:20:51,668 --> 00:20:53,504
- Uh...
- Here, let me.

331
00:20:53,545 --> 00:20:56,423
Oh, no, you don't... What, are
you putting this guy to work?

332
00:20:56,465 --> 00:20:58,884
(WHISPERS)
You what? He's a what?

333
00:20:58,926 --> 00:21:01,220
Yeah, the tent's still up
so I hired him.

334
00:21:01,261 --> 00:21:03,889
- Oh, my God, are you insane?
- No, why would you say that?

335
00:21:03,931 --> 00:21:05,349
Because you didn't even ask me.

336
00:21:05,390 --> 00:21:06,808
But I figured
we needed somebody.

337
00:21:06,850 --> 00:21:08,620
But we said that
we were gonna talk about this.

338
00:21:08,644 --> 00:21:10,395
- SASCHA: Hey, Deb?
- Yeah?

339
00:21:10,437 --> 00:21:11,980
SASCHA: For the tea.

340
00:21:13,023 --> 00:21:15,150
- Milk, please.
- Done and done.

341
00:21:15,192 --> 00:21:17,069
Do you need help
finding where stuff is, or...?

342
00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:19,988
No, it's very intuitive.

00:30:42,759 --> 00:30:44,469
You could be the blimp
at the game

514
00:30:44,511 --> 00:30:47,264
instead of one of
the players, you know?

515
00:30:48,056 --> 00:30:50,184
Just floating over.

516
00:30:51,977 --> 00:30:53,645
Was that supposed
to make me feel better?

517
00:30:53,687 --> 00:30:54,730
Yes.

518
00:30:54,771 --> 00:30:57,357
So, yeah, you know,
I like dog babies,

519
00:30:57,399 --> 00:30:58,859
but I liked human babies more.

520
00:30:58,901 --> 00:31:01,153
And that's kinda where I settled
and ended up here.

521
00:31:01,195 --> 00:31:04,156
Everything else is looking good.
Do you wanna know the sex?

522
00:31:04,823 --> 00:31:06,325
Um...

523
00:31:07,367 --> 00:31:09,244
Yeah.

524
00:31:09,286 --> 00:31:11,997
Fuck it. What are we working
with? Poker or fireplace?

525
00:31:13,332 --> 00:31:15,667
- Huh?
- Like a poker.

526
00:31:17,377 --> 00:31:19,087
(LAUGHS)

527
00:31:20,756 --> 00:31:23,175
Strange joke.

528
00:31:23,217 --> 00:31:24,718
- Thanks.
- DOCTOR: Um...

529
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:27,304
Yeah, things are a little turned
around here.

530
00:31:27,346 --> 00:31:29,181
So let's see if we can get
some movement.

531
00:31:29,223 --> 00:31:31,183
(WHISPERS) Hello, baby, come on.

532
00:31:31,225 --> 00:31:34,645
Come on. Sprinkle a little dust.

533
00:31:36,063 --> 00:31:37,606
Come on.

534
00:31:37,648 --> 00:31:40,108
Oh! See? There we are.
Right there.

535
00:31:40,150 --> 00:31:43,904
You have
a very distinctive, um...

536
00:31:43,946 --> 00:31:45,447
A dick?

537
00:31:45,489 --> 00:31:49,493
Uh, yes.
You're gonna have a boy.

538
00:31:49,535 --> 00:31:52,162

- What?

539
00:31:53,497 --> 00:31:54,706
SASCHA: Congrats.

540
00:31:55,707 --> 00:31:58,168
DOCTOR: Uh... so, yeah, I...

541
00:31:58,210 --> 00:32:03,715
I know there's some talk
about having this baby at home,

542
00:32:03,757 --> 00:32:04,883
which, hey, that's fine.

543
00:32:04,925 --> 00:32:08,136
I just wanted to talk about
the risks, given that you're...

544
00:32:08,178 --> 00:32:10,848
- Old as fuck?
- No, no. You're in great shape.

545
00:32:10,889 --> 00:32:12,975
It's just we should talk about,
um...

546
00:32:13,016 --> 00:32:14,601
there is a risk
of complications.

547
00:32:14,643 --> 00:32:16,353
- DEB: Right.
- We should talk about it.

548
00:32:16,395 --> 00:32:18,230
No, I do remember this
from last time.

549
00:32:18,272 --> 00:32:21,191
It's just that my partner Silvio
doesn't...

550
00:32:21,233 --> 00:32:24,278
- He's... No, um...
- Hm-hmm.

551
00:32:24,319 --> 00:32:27,239
I just need more time to make
a decision. Is that cool?

552
00:32:27,281 --> 00:32:29,074
DOCTOR: That's cool.
Whatever is cool.

553
00:32:29,116 --> 00:32:31,785
You're cool. Everybody's cool.
Yes, take your time.

554
00:32:31,827 --> 00:32:33,954
We can talk about it
next time you come in.

555
00:32:33,996 --> 00:32:35,414
OK. Thank you.

556
00:32:35,455 --> 00:32:37,082
All right. Have a great day,
you two.

557
00:32:37,124 --> 00:32:40,460
- OK. Thank you, Dr. Zonkowski.
- Be blessed. See ya. Bye.

558
00:32:42,045 --> 00:32:44,590
I'm gonna run to the bathroom.
I'll meet you outside.

559
00:32:44,631 --> 00:32:45,966
OK.

- Hey, Dr. Gregory Zonkowski?

562
00:32:59,479 --> 00:33:00,814
Yes, sir.

563
00:33:00,856 --> 00:33:02,316
SASCHA:
Yeah, sorry to bother you.

564
00:33:02,357 --> 00:33:04,318
I just have a quick question.

565
00:33:04,359 --> 00:33:07,321
Yeah, OK. No prob.
What's going on?

566
00:33:07,362 --> 00:33:09,489
What's your C-section rate?

567
00:33:13,869 --> 00:33:16,872
You look familiar. Where you
in the room with, uh, Debbie?

568
00:33:16,914 --> 00:33:19,708
- Deb.
- Deb, yeah.

569
00:33:19,750 --> 00:33:21,043
And you are? Who are you again?

570
00:33:21,084 --> 00:33:23,378
- Are you Dad?
- I'm the doula.

571
00:33:24,671 --> 00:33:26,423
The doula.

572
00:33:27,257 --> 00:33:29,009
Yeah, OK.

573
00:33:30,427 --> 00:33:33,096
Don't get me wrong.
You say that you're a doula.

574
00:33:33,138 --> 00:33:36,892
And I can respect that. Um...

575
00:33:36,934 --> 00:33:40,395
- But in all honesty, we don't...
- What's your rate, though?

576
00:33:41,355 --> 00:33:42,940
There are no numbers on that

577
00:33:42,981 --> 00:33:44,900
and we see this
more and more now.

578
00:33:44,942 --> 00:33:47,819
Not to be rude, if you
really want to advocate for her,

579
00:33:47,861 --> 00:33:49,738
you should tell her
to have the baby here.

580
00:33:49,780 --> 00:33:51,448
Are you a cutter?

581
00:33:51,490 --> 00:33:54,409
- I don't know who you...
- What's the cut-off time?

582
00:33:54,451 --> 00:33:56,453
- The cut-off time?
- Eight hours?

583
00:33:56,995 --> 00:33:58,121
Seven?

584
00:33:58,163 --> 00:33:59,331
- Hi.
- Hey.

585
00:33:59,373 --> 00:34:01,875
- What's up? Ready.
- Yeah, so am I.

586
00:34:03,418 --> 00:34:04,711
Hi.

587
00:34:09,842 --> 00:34:12,594
- SASCHA: <i>Where's Silvio today?
</i>- DEB:<i> Uh, he had a meeting.</i>

588
00:34:12,636 --> 00:34:14,388
SASCHA:
<i>Was he excited about this baby?</i>

589
00:34:14,429 --> 00:34:16,264
- DEB: Yeah.
- SASCHA: And you?

590
00:34:16,306 --> 00:34:17,724
DEB: Um, yeah.

591
00:34:17,766 --> 00:34:22,521
I mean, it's a lot. We weren't
together very long before we...

592
00:34:22,563 --> 00:34:24,356
- Before I...
- How long?

593
00:34:24,398 --> 00:34:25,607
Three weeks.

594
00:34:25,649 --> 00:34:28,944
- I know. It's Wack City, right?
- I don't know about Wack City,

595
00:34:28,985 --> 00:34:30,862
but judging from the way
you play basketball,

596
00:34:30,904 --> 00:34:33,532
I think you might have
borderline personality disorder.

597
00:34:33,574 --> 00:34:34,783
Excuse me? Yo.

598
00:34:34,824 --> 00:34:37,703
Silvio didn't ask me
before hiring you.

599
00:34:37,744 --> 00:34:39,871
- Did you know that?
- I did not.

600
00:34:39,913 --> 00:34:42,541
Yeah, so I don't know
what you were talking about

601
00:34:42,583 --> 00:34:43,583
with the doctor in there.

602
00:34:43,625 --> 00:34:46,170
But if you could, like,
not do that.

603
00:34:46,210 --> 00:34:49,214
- Do what?
- Like, have conversations...

604
00:34:49,255 --> 00:34:52,176
(WHISPERS) ...about my pregnancy
without me being in the room.

605
00:34:52,217 --> 00:34:55,679
- Of course.
- Because it's just...

606
00:34:55,721 --> 00:34:57,264
- No, I get it.
- ...not a cool thing.

607
00:34:57,306 --> 00:34:59,558
Just so you know, I wasn't.

608
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:02,102
Really? What were you
talking to him about then?

609
00:35:02,144 --> 00:35:04,646
I thought he might've been
the brother of someone

610
00:35:04,688 --> 00:35:06,940
I went to midwifery school with.

611
00:35:09,151 --> 00:35:12,821
Do you know what the word doula
literally translates to?

612
00:35:12,863 --> 00:35:14,031
Haven't we covered this?

613
00:35:14,072 --> 00:35:15,824
The one who speaks for the woman

614
00:35:15,866 --> 00:35:19,328
when her teeth
are gritted in pain.

615
00:35:19,369 --> 00:35:21,622
I thought that you said
it was like a helper slave.

616
00:35:21,663 --> 00:35:25,375
Deb, the moment you don't
need me anymore, I will vanish.

617
00:35:25,417 --> 00:35:27,377
I don't make plans without you.

618
00:35:29,046 --> 00:35:31,465
If I say that I want
a hospital birth

619
00:35:31,507 --> 00:35:34,676
with a motherfucking epidural?

620
00:35:34,718 --> 00:35:38,430
- Great. Bring on the drugs.
- Seriously?

621
00:35:38,472 --> 00:35:41,350
Deb, who's having this baby?
Is Silvio having this baby?

622
00:35:41,391 --> 00:35:43,435
Is the doctor with hairy arms
having the baby?

623
00:35:43,477 --> 00:35:44,436
Oh, my God!

624
00:35:44,478 --> 00:35:46,605

- Yes.

What about him?

658
00:37:25,370 --> 00:37:27,789
Yeah, and that's fine.
Ultimately, it's her birth.

659
00:37:27,831 --> 00:37:30,709
Right, but what's your
impression of him? Is he bad?

660
00:37:30,751 --> 00:37:32,628
- I wouldn't say bad.
- What would you say?

661
00:37:32,669 --> 00:37:36,173
I'm just worried he might be
a little... scalpel-happy,

we're gonna keep an eye on it.

- Jesus!
- Don't mention anything to Deb.

No, I won't. It's just, I want
her to do the right thing.

<i>What's a doula?</i>

682
00:38:47,661 --> 00:38:50,205
Oh, well, a doula,
the literal translation...

683
00:38:50,247 --> 00:38:53,292
- Who are you talking to?
- Oh, Deb. Come here, it's Will.

684
00:38:53,333 --> 00:38:56,378
Hey, Will, this is Deb.

685
00:38:56,420 --> 00:38:57,588
Come on.

686
00:39:02,092 --> 00:39:03,468
- WILL:<i> Hi.
</i>- Hi.

687
00:39:03,510 --> 00:39:06,972
<i>- Nice to meet you.
</i>- Nice to meet you too, Will.

688
00:39:07,014 --> 00:39:10,142
<i>Am I gonna have a little sister
or a little brother?</i>

689
00:39:10,184 --> 00:39:12,936
They don't know.
It's gonna be a surprise.

690
00:39:12,978 --> 00:39:14,354
<i>Well, cool.</i>

691
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:19,610
Uh, Will, did you get
the basketball that I sent?

692
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:22,988
<i>- Oh, yeah.
</i>- Great.

693
00:39:23,030 --> 00:39:24,907
Have you... Did you try it out?

694
00:39:24,948 --> 00:39:27,367
<i>- Yeah, it's big.
</i>- Yeah, well, it's full size.

695
00:39:27,409 --> 00:39:29,536
That's my idea. If you learn
to play on that one,

696
00:39:29,578 --> 00:39:30,704
by the time your hands grow,

697
00:39:30,746 --> 00:39:32,664
you're gonna be playing
like James Harden.

698
00:39:32,706 --> 00:39:34,208
It's all about ball control.

699
00:39:34,249 --> 00:39:36,835
<i>My uncle says
James Harden is a nihilist.</i>

700
00:39:38,420 --> 00:39:40,631
Your uncle's a wise man.

701
00:39:41,924 --> 00:39:43,800
Uh, well, we should
play together.

702
00:39:43,842 --> 00:39:45,969
You know,
when I'm not so pregnant.

703
00:39:46,011 --> 00:39:48,639
<i>Oh. Will the new house
have a hoop?</i>

704
00:39:49,765 --> 00:39:51,266
The new house?

705
00:39:51,308 --> 00:39:54,269
I cannot believe that you are
trying to justify this now.

706
00:39:54,311 --> 00:39:57,022
You are so out of touch, my man.

707
00:39:57,064 --> 00:39:59,316
God, first the doula, now this?

708
00:39:59,358 --> 00:40:01,860
No. Look, I'm just trying to do
the right thing by my kid, Deb.

709
00:40:01,902 --> 00:40:02,819
His mother is a nightmare.

710
00:40:02,861 --> 00:40:04,863
His mother told you to take him.

711
00:40:04,905 --> 00:40:07,908
(INDISTINCT ARGUING)

712
00:40:07,950 --> 00:40:11,662
DEB: She said, "Jump,"
and you said, "How high?"

713
00:40:11,703 --> 00:40:14,039
SILVIO: That is not
what happened.

714
00:40:14,081 --> 00:40:16,583
I promise
I will make this up to you.

715
00:40:16,625 --> 00:40:18,544
How? (LAUGHS)

716
00:40:18,585 --> 00:40:19,771
Look, I'm just doing that thing

717
00:40:19,795 --> 00:40:22,714
where I wanna
take care of everyone, you know?

718
00:40:22,756 --> 00:40:24,424
- (GROANS)
- I just...

719
00:40:25,133 --> 00:40:26,927
Will you let me try?

720
00:40:26,969 --> 00:40:30,097
Let me try.
I promise I won't let you down.

721
00:40:33,433 --> 00:40:34,560
Bro.

722
00:40:34,601 --> 00:40:37,896
Swirling, no longer a maiden.

723
00:40:37,938 --> 00:40:41,567
And feel the sway right there,
just the sway.

724
00:40:41,608 --> 00:40:44,027
And one, two, three, push up.

725
00:40:44,069 --> 00:40:48,156
Kick away your old self.
It's not about you anymore.

726
00:40:48,198 --> 00:40:50,742
That is your old life.
That is your maiden self.

727
00:40:50,784 --> 00:40:55,289
You're pushing her away
to welcome in the mother.

728
00:40:55,330 --> 00:40:58,584
Breathe in. Breathe out,
breathe in, breathe out.

729
00:41:00,002 --> 00:41:03,797
Breathe in. (GRUNTS)
Breathe out.

730
00:41:04,965 --> 00:41:09,803
So today... it was about work.

731
00:41:09,845 --> 00:41:15,851
Because it is work
to bring a baby into the world.

732
00:41:15,893 --> 00:41:17,436
Or babies.

733
00:41:17,477 --> 00:41:19,730
Sometimes it's twice the work.
I have twins.

734
00:41:19,771 --> 00:41:23,358
Breathe in. (LAUGHS)
Breathe out.

735
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:28,030
But mammas are strong
and mammas are capable.

736
00:41:28,071 --> 00:41:31,950
And that's why today
for closing words...

737
00:41:33,202 --> 00:41:36,872
I wanna ask everyone
what do you think

738
00:41:36,914 --> 00:41:40,209
will take a little bit of work

739
00:41:40,250 --> 00:41:43,670
to bring these babies
into this world?

740
00:41:49,051 --> 00:41:50,302
Chelsea.

741
00:41:50,344 --> 00:41:54,264
I'm just a little concerned
about the... the pooping part.

742
00:41:54,306 --> 00:41:57,976
My cousin Claire,
just... all over.

743
00:41:59,895 --> 00:42:04,316
Well, I'm scared about, um...
<i>after</i> it's here.

744
00:42:04,358 --> 00:42:07,027
Perineum tear.

745
00:42:07,069 --> 00:42:09,321
I'm really, really, really
scared about it,

746
00:42:09,363 --> 00:42:13,784
and I really wanna
have this baby naturally.

747
00:42:14,493 --> 00:42:16,954
So I'm just gonna...

748
00:42:16,995 --> 00:42:21,750
get really strong down there
and...

749
00:42:21,792 --> 00:42:25,003
- and really flexible.
- TUTOR: Yes!

750
00:42:25,045 --> 00:42:27,130
So brave.

751
00:42:29,967 --> 00:42:33,345
- Deb.
- Me?

752
00:42:33,387 --> 00:42:35,347
How are you, dear Deb?

753
00:42:35,389 --> 00:42:38,392
I'm... good, dear Gracie.

754
00:42:38,433 --> 00:42:41,562
So what's gonna take
a little hard work on your end?

755
00:42:41,603 --> 00:42:42,813
Uh...

756
00:42:42,855 --> 00:42:46,400
Shit. Um, gosh, I...

757
00:42:47,860 --> 00:42:50,320
I really hate this part.
Can I just skip?

758
00:42:50,362 --> 00:42:52,573
You can't skip.

759
00:42:52,614 --> 00:42:56,451
- What? Yes, I can.
- No, you can't.

760
00:42:56,493 --> 00:43:00,330
- Where is that written?
- Oh, it's not written anywhere.

761
00:43:00,372 --> 00:43:02,457
We're a circle of mammas.

762
00:43:02,499 --> 00:43:03,917
So we, you know,

763
00:43:03,959 --> 00:43:07,087
we didn't actually get any pens
and write it down.

764
00:43:07,129 --> 00:43:09,381
We don't have any rules
that we wrote.

765
00:43:09,423 --> 00:43:11,216
Yeah, I'm just...
I'm gonna skip.

766
00:43:11,258 --> 00:43:13,260
You can't skip things!

767
00:43:15,596 --> 00:43:17,973
It can't be skipped.

768
00:43:19,224 --> 00:43:21,351
You can't skip.

769
00:43:26,064 --> 00:43:30,402
Uh. (EXHALES) My...

770
00:43:30,444 --> 00:43:33,155
My boyfriend's kid
is moving in with us

771
00:43:33,197 --> 00:43:35,407
and that's not inherently
a bad thing.

772
00:43:35,449 --> 00:43:37,743
He seems like
a really sweet kid,

773
00:43:37,784 --> 00:43:41,747
but I'm just
a little bit worried that the...

774
00:43:41,788 --> 00:43:47,419
the baby is gonna be...
lost in all of this.

775
00:43:50,380 --> 00:43:52,841
Actually that, that's, um...
that's not true.

776
00:43:52,883 --> 00:43:55,093
I'm not worried that the baby's
gonna be forgotten.

777
00:43:55,135 --> 00:43:59,890
I'm just worried that<i> I'm
</i>going to be... forgotten.

778
00:44:01,850 --> 00:44:04,520
You know, Silvio has got me
knocked up and now what am I?

779
00:44:04,561 --> 00:44:07,940
I'm just like a...
I'm a hostage in my own body.

780
00:44:07,981 --> 00:44:10,317
I'm a goddamn delivery vessel.

781
00:44:12,986 --> 00:44:17,491
But, uh, I've got Sasch,
you know, my doula.

782
00:44:17,533 --> 00:44:19,159
So that's chill.

783
00:44:19,952 --> 00:44:21,745
Smells a little musty.

784
00:44:21,787 --> 00:44:26,500
But whatever, there. I shared.

785
00:44:27,209 --> 00:44:28,335

That's what I want to do.

Call it what it is, all right?
A pussy.

789
00:45:25,100 --> 00:45:27,519
OK. Well, the doctors
are gonna love that.

790
00:45:27,561 --> 00:45:30,147
(LAUGHS) Yeah, well, don't you
worry about Dr. Zonkowski.

791
00:45:30,189 --> 00:45:31,982
I'll take care of him.

792
00:45:39,781 --> 00:45:41,867
And I'm so excited to use those.
They're robot boobs.

793
00:45:41,909 --> 00:45:43,535
I don't want robot boobs.

794
00:45:43,577 --> 00:45:45,662
- OK, I'll put 'em down.
- It's from me.

795
00:45:45,704 --> 00:45:47,623
Oh, the grinder.
Now I can cultivate

796
00:45:47,664 --> 00:45:49,708
those German
field worker forearms.

797

This is how we grind ze food
for ze baby.

This is how you grind
ze baby into ze food.

799

<i>- Ja!
</i>- Grind the baby and eat it.

800
00:45:57,716 --> 00:46:00,344
- That's great.
- It's for food for the baby.

801
00:46:00,385 --> 00:46:02,763
It's to make baby food.

non-conforming, dummy.

- SILVIO: Yeah, yeah.
- NAUREEN: Aw.

It's beautiful, boo.
That's really nice.

Actually coming out right now.

Right here.

OK, but we... I still haven't
decided if I wanna do that.

837
00:47:37,399 --> 00:47:39,943
This is just in case you do
decide to do a home birth.

838
00:47:39,985 --> 00:47:42,779
And then... but if you don't,
then we can just return it.

it's non-returnable up here.

- SASCHA: Prolapse?

It's... it's where the vagina
turns inside out, basically.

she possessed three rocks.

Um... in order to use
the magic of the rocks,

1413
01:17:18,972 --> 01:17:21,350
all three rocks
had to be together.

1414

Only then
could the magic be used.

could control people's actions.

1417

could control people's emotions.

was 21, so that's pretty young.

back in a couple of hours

01:24:40,831 --> 01:24:45,919
So, anyway, once I bailed my mom
outta jail that time,

1526
01:24:45,961 --> 01:24:48,755
I swore
that I would never do it again.

1527
01:24:48,797 --> 01:24:50,507
Anyway, I heard
she's down in Yuma

1528
01:24:50,549 --> 01:24:52,009
working on some lettuce farm.

1529
01:24:52,050 --> 01:24:56,138
You know, my point
is my mom did OK, you know?

1530
01:24:56,180 --> 01:24:57,723
I mean, it is not healthy for me

1531
01:24:57,764 --> 01:25:00,851
to be around her at this point,
but...

1532
01:25:00,893 --> 01:25:04,855
she did it alone.
I can do it alone.

1533

- Yeah?

don't need men, do we, Tammi?

I could've made a go of it
with Tom... but I didn't.

It's just maybe try shaving
the hair back a little bit

or... or else tanning the skin
underneath,

1574

isn't so great.
