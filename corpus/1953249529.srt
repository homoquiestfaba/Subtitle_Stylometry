<i>MAN: What's out there,
out in the great beyond?</i>

3
00:00:54,153 --> 00:00:56,255
<i>And what's beyond that?</i>

4
00:00:56,256 --> 00:00:58,957
<i>What's beyond beyond?</i>

5
00:00:58,958 --> 00:01:01,994
<i>The answer is: I don't know.</i>

6
00:01:01,995 --> 00:01:04,796
<i>And quite frankly,
I don't want to know,</i>

7
00:01:04,797 --> 00:01:07,166
<i>because what I do know
is that they don't</i>

<i>I myself am friends

<i>And Mrs. Kim,

17
00:01:31,757 --> 00:01:33,357
Hey, Mrs. Kim.

18
00:01:33,358 --> 00:01:35,627
Spray me.
Spray me, neighbor.

19
00:01:35,628 --> 00:01:36,961
Whoo!

20
00:01:36,962 --> 00:01:38,497
Sun shower.

21
00:01:38,498 --> 00:01:40,098
Fun shower!

22
00:01:40,099 --> 00:01:42,232
<i>I don't have

23
00:01:42,233 --> 00:01:43,768
<i>but I am on the market.</i>

24
00:01:43,769 --> 00:01:45,069
My name's Evan Trautwig.

25
00:01:45,070 --> 00:01:46,237
Oh. Ed Bosani.

26
00:01:46,238 --> 00:01:47,539
<i>Every day, I ask</i>

27
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:49,407
<i>not what Glenview

<i>What can I do for Glenview?</i>

29
00:01:50,408 --> 00:01:51,408
Oh, geez, Jared, your glutes

30
00:01:51,409 --> 00:01:52,712
are tighter than a snare drum.

31
00:01:52,713 --> 00:01:55,413
<i>That's why I founded
the running club,</i>

<i>¿Donde esta
mi tanque de oxigeno?</i>

34
00:02:00,553 --> 00:02:02,188
<i>...and created the position</i>

35
00:02:02,189 --> 00:02:04,389
<i>of deputy secretary
at the city council.</i>

36
00:02:04,390 --> 00:02:05,925
All right,
next item on the agenda

37
00:02:05,926 --> 00:02:08,260
stipulates curb height
for wheelchair access

38
00:02:08,261 --> 00:02:10,261
be no more than six inches
in height.

39
00:02:10,262 --> 00:02:11,763
Now, I know this is a hot topic,

40
00:02:11,764 --> 00:02:13,366
so I will defer
to the commissioner.

41
00:02:13,367 --> 00:02:16,434
<i>Here, dreams
really do come true.</i>

42
00:02:16,435 --> 00:02:19,838
<i>A simple man can start out
as a junior manager at Costco,</i>

43
00:02:19,839 --> 00:02:22,440
<i>and 12 years later,
with hard work and gumption,</i>

44
00:02:22,441 --> 00:02:26,344
<i>end up the senior manager
at that very same Costco.</i>

45
00:02:26,345 --> 00:02:29,147
<i>I should know,
because that man's name</i>

46
00:02:29,148 --> 00:02:31,081
<i>is me.</i>

47
00:02:31,082 --> 00:02:32,485
I don't mean to bust
your chops here, kid,

48
00:02:32,486 --> 00:02:34,219
but this is total bullshit.

49
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:36,153
Those rats are as flat
as they ever have been.

50
00:02:36,154 --> 00:02:37,521
I'm sorry. It really
should be working.

51
00:02:37,522 --> 00:02:38,789
Excuse me, sir, if I might.

52
00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:40,626
The activation button
is right there.

53
00:02:40,627 --> 00:02:41,960
Holy shit.

54
00:02:41,961 --> 00:02:43,561
This is incredible.

55
00:02:43,562 --> 00:02:44,963
Yeah.

56
00:02:44,964 --> 00:02:47,299
There's chipmunks all coming
out of the TV, Costco!

57
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:49,299
Look, the whole gang's here.

58
00:02:47,299 --> 00:02:49,067
Yeah. Yeah,
it's a great set.

59
00:02:49,068 --> 00:02:52,069
Full HD, 1080p,
240 hertz, TrueMotion.

60
00:02:52,070 --> 00:02:54,070
Totally wireless...

61
00:02:52,070 --> 00:02:54,205
Hey, hey, hey, buddy, please.

62
00:02:54,206 --> 00:02:55,940
This is a miracle of technology.

63
00:02:55,941 --> 00:02:57,341
This is incredible.

64
00:02:57,342 --> 00:02:58,842
Where do I pay for this baby?

65
00:02:58,843 --> 00:03:00,410
Justin will load you up.
Go to front-end checkout.

66
00:03:00,411 --> 00:03:01,412
- You're a beauty.
- Okay.

67
00:03:01,415 --> 00:03:03,413
Thank you, switch man.

68
00:03:01,413 --> 00:03:03,013
All right.

69
00:03:03,014 --> 00:03:04,014
Turning the switch on!

70
00:03:03,014 --> 00:03:04,081
Ow.

71
00:03:04,082 --> 00:03:05,585
Turning on a whole new
world for me.

72
00:03:05,586 --> 00:03:08,286
Hey, Justin, if we stop by
some free food samples,

73
00:03:08,287 --> 00:03:09,456
I'm not gonna be
pissed, either.

Hey, there he is.

80
00:03:26,572 --> 00:03:28,572
So?

81
00:03:26,572 --> 00:03:28,606
There are 50 stars

82
00:03:28,607 --> 00:03:30,442
on the American flag,

83
00:03:30,443 --> 00:03:33,644
the Constitution
was written in 1787,

84
00:03:33,645 --> 00:03:34,745

85
00:03:34,746 --> 00:03:36,915
I am now an American citizen.

86
00:03:36,916 --> 00:03:38,084
(whooping laugh)

87
00:03:38,085 --> 00:03:39,084
Really?

88
00:03:38,084 --> 00:03:39,484
Yes.

89
00:03:39,485 --> 00:03:40,317
Oh!

90
00:03:40,318 --> 00:03:42,453
Antonio, that's great.

91
00:03:42,454 --> 00:03:43,755
I knew it. I knew it.

92
00:03:43,756 --> 00:03:45,524
You see, good things
happen to good people,

93
00:03:45,525 --> 00:03:47,025
and you are a good man.

94
00:03:47,026 --> 00:03:49,394
Oh. And look, boss.

95
00:03:49,395 --> 00:03:51,196
I got a new tattoo to celebrate.

96
00:03:51,197 --> 00:03:52,197
Oh.

97
00:03:51,197 --> 00:03:52,562
Yeah.

98
00:03:52,563 --> 00:03:53,798
Wow.

99
00:03:53,799 --> 00:03:55,799
That's really fresh, isn't it?

100
00:03:53,799 --> 00:03:55,399
Yeah.

"Proud to be an American."

102
00:03:56,501 --> 00:03:57,902
Good. Maybe keep it
covered, though,

103
00:03:57,903 --> 00:04:00,037
just 'cause it's not really
Costco policy, okay?

104
00:04:00,038 --> 00:04:02,038
Yes, of course, boss.

105
00:04:00,038 --> 00:04:02,306

106
00:04:02,307 --> 00:04:03,308

Oh, hey, listen.

110
00:04:07,312 --> 00:04:09,381
If a bag of Bugles

112
00:04:10,849 --> 00:04:11,983
You earned it.

113
00:04:11,984 --> 00:04:14,186

Listen!

00:06:22,648 --> 00:06:24,948
They gave me a gun, okay?

156
00:06:24,949 --> 00:06:28,318
And they didn't teach me
to use it properly.

157

go to a few museums.

00:07:35,487 --> 00:07:37,487
Yeah?

183
00:07:35,487 --> 00:07:37,588
I'm going to walk
through that door,

184
00:07:37,589 --> 00:07:41,059
and we are going to S-C-R-E-W.

185
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:42,259
Ooh, okay, okay.

186
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:43,728
(laughing):
Right on the kitchen floor.

187
00:07:43,729 --> 00:07:45,463
Mmm, I love it
when you spell it.

188
00:07:45,464 --> 00:07:46,597
Definitely.

189
00:07:46,598 --> 00:07:48,465
Or we could do it
in the bedroom.

190
00:07:48,466 --> 00:07:50,466
Thank you. Okay.

191
00:07:48,466 --> 00:07:50,268
Or we could...

192
00:07:50,269 --> 00:07:53,070
start in the kitchen,
then move up to the bedroom.

193
00:07:53,071 --> 00:07:54,237
Bye.

194
00:07:54,238 --> 00:07:55,840
Have fun.

195
00:07:55,841 --> 00:07:58,042
Be safe.

196
00:07:58,043 --> 00:07:59,083
I love you.

197
00:08:04,083 --> 00:08:06,951
What is going on?

198
00:08:06,952 --> 00:08:10,121
(siren whooping)

199
00:08:10,122 --> 00:08:12,499
(indistinct radio communication,
helicopter hovering)

200
00:08:20,499 --> 00:08:22,133
Whoa. Sorry, sir.

201
00:08:22,134 --> 00:08:24,134
Can't let you in there.

202
00:08:22,134 --> 00:08:24,201
No, no, no, it's okay.

203
00:08:24,202 --> 00:08:26,036
I'm the, uh, manager.
This is my store.

204
00:08:26,037 --> 00:08:27,706
Well, I'm afraid
your store is closed

205
00:08:27,707 --> 00:08:29,706
- until further notice.
- What are you talking about?

206
00:08:29,709 --> 00:08:31,609
I can't divulge that, sir.

207
00:08:31,610 --> 00:08:33,577
Police policy.

208
00:08:33,578 --> 00:08:35,146
Oh, wait a second.

209
00:08:35,147 --> 00:08:37,048
You're the manager,
so do you happen to know

210
00:08:37,049 --> 00:08:39,316
the name of the guy
who was working last night?

211
00:08:39,317 --> 00:08:40,752
Yes... Antonio.

212
00:08:40,753 --> 00:08:42,385
Antonio Guzman.

213
00:08:42,386 --> 00:08:43,586
Antonio...

214
00:08:43,587 --> 00:08:45,122
Why? Did something
happen to him?

215
00:08:45,123 --> 00:08:47,392
Guz...man.

216
00:08:47,393 --> 00:08:49,196
Yeah, he's dead.

217
00:08:50,196 --> 00:08:51,394
What?

218
00:08:51,395 --> 00:08:53,965
Are... are you sure?

219
00:08:53,966 --> 00:08:55,365
Pretty sure.

220
00:08:55,366 --> 00:08:58,536
Looks like your friend was
ripped apart by a wild animal.

221
00:08:58,537 --> 00:09:00,037
Jesus.

222
00:09:00,038 --> 00:09:02,773
We're dealing with one
sick son of a B.

223
00:09:02,774 --> 00:09:04,609
Took the victim's skin.

224
00:09:04,610 --> 00:09:05,976
Is... did...

225
00:09:05,977 --> 00:09:08,678
did... are there...
are there any leads

226
00:09:08,679 --> 00:09:11,248
or... fingerprints or...?

227
00:09:11,249 --> 00:09:12,917
Slow down, guy.

228
00:09:12,918 --> 00:09:15,353
I mean, we only got here,
like, two hours ago.

229
00:09:15,354 --> 00:09:17,955
We strung up this yellow tape,
which took a while.

230
00:09:17,956 --> 00:09:21,292
So, uh, you knew
the victim well?

231
00:09:21,293 --> 00:09:22,560
Yeah. I...

232
00:09:22,561 --> 00:09:23,729
He was a friend.

233
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:26,430
He was... just became
an American citizen.

234
00:09:26,431 --> 00:09:28,298
And that made you angry.

235
00:09:28,299 --> 00:09:29,498
No, it made me happy.

236
00:09:29,499 --> 00:09:30,869
I was happy for him.
He was...

237
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:32,839
Then why'd you kill him?

238
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:35,407
I didn't kill him.

239
00:09:35,408 --> 00:09:38,945
What... what are you
talking about?

240
00:09:39,945 --> 00:09:42,347
Why are you staring
at me like that?

241
00:09:43,347 --> 00:09:44,715
I'm just kidding.

242
00:09:44,716 --> 00:09:47,151
Come on. Maybe you can
help I.D. the body.

243
00:09:47,152 --> 00:09:48,052
Back here.

244
00:09:48,053 --> 00:09:49,995
I had you going,
though... man!

245
00:09:57,995 --> 00:10:00,176
("The Sound of Silence"
playing in Spanish)

246
00:10:11,176 --> 00:10:12,809
<i>FEMALE REPORTER:
The victim has been identified</i>

247
00:10:12,810 --> 00:10:14,176
<i>as Antonio Guzman.</i>

248
00:10:14,177 --> 00:10:15,746
<i>Here's what police told us
about the attack.</i>

249
00:10:15,747 --> 00:10:18,516
OFFICER:
We will do the best we can,

250
00:10:18,517 --> 00:10:20,151
but I, for one,
would like to put

251
00:10:20,152 --> 00:10:23,254
some of the responsibility
on the citizens of this town.

252
00:10:23,255 --> 00:10:25,356
There's only like eight cops
in this town,

253
00:10:25,357 --> 00:10:27,825
and there's thousands
of you guys, so,

254
00:10:27,826 --> 00:10:31,028
not to point fingers
or anything, but...

255
00:10:31,029 --> 00:10:33,364
Stay with us
for the latest details

256
00:10:33,365 --> 00:10:34,864
on this developing story.

257
00:10:34,865 --> 00:10:37,101
Back to you, Gail.

258

259
00:10:40,806 --> 00:10:43,374
(cheering)

260
00:10:43,375 --> 00:10:44,875
(buzzer sounds)

261
00:10:44,876 --> 00:10:47,612
ANNOUNCER: That's the half,
and as the players

262
00:10:47,613 --> 00:10:49,412
march into the locking room,
we're going to be

263
00:10:49,413 --> 00:10:50,549
joined on the field by, um...

264
00:10:51,549 --> 00:10:53,495
Evan Trautwig.

265
00:11:03,495 --> 00:11:05,365
(music fades)

266
00:11:07,365 --> 00:11:12,168
Did anyone here cry themselves
to sleep last night?

267
00:11:12,169 --> 00:11:15,072
(laughter)

268
00:11:15,073 --> 00:11:17,075
EVAN:
It's okay. You can laugh.

269
00:11:17,076 --> 00:11:19,810
Laughter is a common expression
of grief.

270
00:11:19,811 --> 00:11:22,080
And yes, I did cry.

271
00:11:22,081 --> 00:11:24,983
Because a man
was killed yesterday.

272
00:11:24,984 --> 00:11:29,820
But tonight,
my tears have turned to fists!

273
00:11:29,821 --> 00:11:31,821
(makes fart noise)

274
00:11:29,821 --> 00:11:31,955
Because whoever did this

275
00:11:31,956 --> 00:11:33,956
is still out there.

276
00:11:31,956 --> 00:11:33,858
BOY: Who is this guy?

277
00:11:33,859 --> 00:11:37,327
And we need to stop him
before he strikes again.

278
00:11:37,328 --> 00:11:38,630
(makes fart noise)
Oh, struck again.

279
00:11:38,631 --> 00:11:40,630
(laughing)

280
00:11:38,630 --> 00:11:40,596
EVAN: No more murders!

281
00:11:40,597 --> 00:11:42,734
Shh.

282
00:11:42,735 --> 00:11:46,537
EVAN:
Because our society has rules.

283
00:11:46,538 --> 00:11:48,973
And one of those rules is:

284
00:11:48,974 --> 00:11:52,976
You can't kill someone
and take their skin!

285
00:11:52,977 --> 00:11:54,681
That's not cool.

286
00:11:56,681 --> 00:11:58,114
So, with that in mind,

287
00:11:58,115 --> 00:12:01,085
I am forming
a neighborhood watch,

288
00:12:01,086 --> 00:12:04,254
a task force
of concerned citizens

289
00:12:04,255 --> 00:12:07,257
to solve the murder
of Antonio Guzman.

290
00:12:07,258 --> 00:12:10,795
To keep an eye on any
and all suspicious activities,

291
00:12:10,796 --> 00:12:13,965
and generally...

292
00:12:13,966 --> 00:12:16,566
get to the bottom of things.

293
00:12:16,567 --> 00:12:18,903
Thank you.

294
00:12:18,904 --> 00:12:21,577
(cheering and applause)

295
00:12:26,577 --> 00:12:28,687
(rattling)

296
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:36,428
(crunching)

297
00:12:43,428 --> 00:12:44,896
Mm-hmm.

298
00:12:44,897 --> 00:12:46,497
Okay.

299
00:12:46,498 --> 00:12:48,298
Solid turnout.

300
00:12:48,299 --> 00:12:49,901
Thanks, everybody, for coming.

301
00:12:49,902 --> 00:12:51,803
You're that guy
from Costco, right?

302
00:12:51,804 --> 00:12:53,771
Yes, I am that guy.

303
00:12:53,772 --> 00:12:54,772
Okay. Yeah.

304
00:12:53,772 --> 00:12:54,973
Thanks.

305
00:12:54,974 --> 00:12:56,474
All right, you want to, uh...

306
00:12:56,475 --> 00:12:57,475
(doorbell rings)

307
00:12:56,475 --> 00:12:57,774
Oh.

308
00:12:57,775 --> 00:12:59,476
One more concerned citizen.

309
00:12:59,477 --> 00:13:00,946
You mind if I look
around the place a little bit?

310
00:13:00,947 --> 00:13:03,614
Looks like you got
a lot of knickknacks.

311
00:13:03,615 --> 00:13:05,450
Oh, wow. Hi.

312
00:13:05,451 --> 00:13:08,518
Neighborhood watch
meeting is...?

313
00:13:08,519 --> 00:13:10,186
Yes. Really?

314
00:13:10,187 --> 00:13:11,187
Yeah.

315
00:13:10,187 --> 00:13:11,622
Great. Wow.

316
00:13:11,623 --> 00:13:12,623
Okay.

317
00:13:11,623 --> 00:13:12,724
I'm Evan.

318
00:13:12,725 --> 00:13:13,725
I'm Jamarcus.

319
00:13:12,725 --> 00:13:13,857
Great to meet you.

320
00:13:13,858 --> 00:13:14,925
Good to meet you.

321
00:13:14,926 --> 00:13:16,059
Great. That's great.

322
00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:17,495
I was hoping another person
would come,

323
00:13:17,496 --> 00:13:20,196
and you're the best type
of person it could be.

324
00:13:20,197 --> 00:13:22,733
I mean, actually, I couldn't
have even hoped as much for...

325
00:13:22,734 --> 00:13:24,734
Wow. This is...

326
00:13:22,734 --> 00:13:24,567
Come on in.

327
00:13:24,568 --> 00:13:27,037
I'm so pleased to have
this effect this early.

328
00:13:27,038 --> 00:13:28,274
Terrific.
This is exciting.

329
00:13:28,275 --> 00:13:30,274
Come on in.

330
00:13:28,274 --> 00:13:30,074
Thank you. I'm excited, too.

331
00:13:30,075 --> 00:13:31,075
Great.

332
00:13:30,075 --> 00:13:31,543
Most people are disappointed

333
00:13:31,544 --> 00:13:33,543
when they meet me, which...

334
00:13:33,544 --> 00:13:34,544
British?

335
00:13:33,544 --> 00:13:34,678
I am.

336
00:13:34,679 --> 00:13:36,679
And you're American.

337
00:13:34,679 --> 00:13:36,247
Yeah.

338
00:13:36,248 --> 00:13:38,816
This looks like it's a, uh...
Thailand or something.

339
00:13:38,817 --> 00:13:41,619
I don't know what it is.
I mean, it's b-beautiful.

340
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:42,954
Oh, my God!

341
00:13:42,955 --> 00:13:44,320
There's another doll
in here! Hi!

342
00:13:44,321 --> 00:13:46,258
Look at this,
there's a doll in here.

343
00:13:46,259 --> 00:13:47,858
Hey, and look at this thing.

344
00:13:47,859 --> 00:13:49,359
Oh, my God,
there's another one!

345
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:51,360
Look at this.
Did you know that?

346
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:51,595
Yeah, yeah, I did.

347
00:13:51,596 --> 00:13:52,596
That's awesome.

348
00:13:51,596 --> 00:13:52,896
It's a Russian nesting doll.

349
00:13:52,897 --> 00:13:54,631
You want to have a seat
and we start the meeting?

350
00:13:54,632 --> 00:13:55,965
That's incredible.
Look at that little doll.

351
00:13:55,966 --> 00:13:57,032
Oh, my goodness, look at that.

352
00:13:57,033 --> 00:13:58,034
Yeah, yeah, can you...

353
00:13:57,034 --> 00:13:58,403
It keeps going.

354
00:13:58,404 --> 00:13:59,536
It keeps going. There's more.

355
00:13:59,537 --> 00:14:00,538
There's more dolls in here.

356
00:13:59,538 --> 00:14:00,838
Yeah.

357
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:02,104
No, they call it
a nesting doll.

358
00:14:02,105 --> 00:14:03,305
You want to sit down,
we can start the meeting?

359
00:14:03,306 --> 00:14:04,373
No, but they keep going.
There's more dolls.

360
00:14:04,374 --> 00:14:05,374
You have one doll,
you have another...

361
00:14:05,375 --> 00:14:06,642
Uh, put this
on top of this doll.

362
00:14:06,643 --> 00:14:08,445
I just got to see...
got to get to the bottom of it.

363
00:14:08,446 --> 00:14:09,447
Yeah, there's a lot.

364
00:14:08,447 --> 00:14:09,679
You're kidding me.

365
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:11,649
Okay, but why don't
we start the meeting.

366
00:14:11,650 --> 00:14:13,718
You're not gonna tell me
that it goes again.

367
00:14:13,719 --> 00:14:15,121
What's that?

368
00:14:17,121 --> 00:14:18,689
Guys, there's another one.

369
00:14:18,690 --> 00:14:19,723
Where can I pick
one of these up?

370
00:14:19,724 --> 00:14:20,859
Yeah, I'm not sure.

371
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:23,060
Want to sit down?
We can, uh, get going?

372
00:14:23,061 --> 00:14:24,628
Okay, I'm gonna jump in
here and do this.

373
00:14:24,629 --> 00:14:26,130
Make a party out of
this thing, right?

374
00:14:26,131 --> 00:14:27,598
Here's some handbooks.

375
00:14:27,599 --> 00:14:28,899
Here you go.

376
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:31,900
Aha.

377
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:31,002
All right.

378
00:14:31,003 --> 00:14:32,369
My name is Evan.

379
00:14:32,370 --> 00:14:33,938
I want to thank
you all for coming.

380
00:14:33,939 --> 00:14:36,440
And I thought we'd start out by
just getting to know each other.

381
00:14:36,441 --> 00:14:40,010
Maybe we each stand up, say
who we are, why we joined up,

382
00:14:40,011 --> 00:14:42,012
what it's all about
for us, okay?

383
00:14:42,013 --> 00:14:43,749
You have any beers
while we get acquainted?

384
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:45,749
Beers? No.

385
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:46,984
No beers.

386
00:14:46,985 --> 00:14:49,019
All right, well,
I'll start this off.

387
00:14:49,020 --> 00:14:51,154
My name is Bob, with a "B."
(chuckles)

388
00:14:51,155 --> 00:14:52,155
Okay. Welcome, Bob.

389
00:14:52,156 --> 00:14:53,290
And, um, I love the town.

390
00:14:53,291 --> 00:14:54,826
I love my wife,
I love my daughter,

391
00:14:54,827 --> 00:14:57,327
and I love getting a chance
to hang with the guys.

392
00:14:57,328 --> 00:14:59,396
So I'm really into
what you're doing here.

393
00:14:59,397 --> 00:15:01,764
Once a week, away from
the wife and kids,

394
00:15:01,765 --> 00:15:03,134
telling some dirty jokes,

395
00:15:03,135 --> 00:15:05,002
having some beers,
if we're good.

396
00:15:05,003 --> 00:15:06,436
I really look forward

397
00:15:06,437 --> 00:15:08,971
to getting a chance
at tearing this shit up.

398
00:15:08,972 --> 00:15:10,171
Really fucking it up.

399
00:15:10,172 --> 00:15:11,440
Great. Thank you, Bob.

400
00:15:11,441 --> 00:15:12,910
Really great to meet you, bud.

401
00:15:12,911 --> 00:15:14,612
You, too, pal.

402
00:15:14,613 --> 00:15:15,979
Uh...

403
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:18,782
Uh, that was a...

404
00:15:18,783 --> 00:15:22,051
that was a great speech.

405
00:15:22,052 --> 00:15:23,921
I'm Franklin.
(chuckles)

406
00:15:23,922 --> 00:15:25,922
Welcome, Franklin.

407
00:15:23,922 --> 00:15:25,822
Yeah.

408
00:15:25,823 --> 00:15:30,226
Uh, few years ago, uh,
dropped out of high school.

409
00:15:30,227 --> 00:15:32,263
Wasn't feeling the vibe.

410
00:15:32,264 --> 00:15:34,931
Wanted to become a member of
the Glenview Police Department.

411
00:15:34,932 --> 00:15:36,932
Mm-hmm.

412
00:15:34,932 --> 00:15:36,800
I guess they didn't see

413
00:15:36,801 --> 00:15:38,735
the magic that was me.

414
00:15:38,736 --> 00:15:42,105
Apparently, I didn't pass
the written exam

415
00:15:42,106 --> 00:15:46,576
or the physical exam
or the mental health exam.

416
00:15:46,577 --> 00:15:48,014
Whatever that means.

417
00:15:50,014 --> 00:15:51,916
So, here I am,
with this vigilante squad,

418
00:15:51,917 --> 00:15:54,518
and I figure that's
the best way to work through

419
00:15:54,519 --> 00:15:56,888
my emotional shit and
bust some heads in the process.

420
00:15:56,889 --> 00:16:00,691
Okay, just to be clear,
we're not a vigilante squad.

421
00:16:00,692 --> 00:16:02,758
Vigilante squad, militia...
whatever you're going for.

422
00:16:02,759 --> 00:16:03,828
Doesn't matter.

423
00:16:03,829 --> 00:16:05,963
No, not-not a militia
or a vigilante squad.

424
00:16:05,964 --> 00:16:07,298
Every group needs a wild card,

425
00:16:07,299 --> 00:16:09,633
and I think it's safe to say
we found ours.

426
00:16:09,634 --> 00:16:10,667
I dig it.

427
00:16:10,668 --> 00:16:11,937
Well, thank you, Franklin.

428
00:16:11,938 --> 00:16:13,937
We got a good one here.

429
00:16:11,937 --> 00:16:13,237
Yep.

430
00:16:13,238 --> 00:16:14,705
What are you about?

431
00:16:14,706 --> 00:16:16,374
Hello. Uh, yeah.

432
00:16:16,375 --> 00:16:17,640
My name's Jamarcus.

433
00:16:17,641 --> 00:16:19,410
Uh, recently
very happily divorced,

434
00:16:19,411 --> 00:16:22,613
and just looking to get more
involved in the local community.

435
00:16:22,614 --> 00:16:24,114
Well, that was simple.

436
00:16:24,115 --> 00:16:25,883
Welcome, Jamarcus.

437
00:16:25,884 --> 00:16:26,984
Ah, also,

438
00:16:26,985 --> 00:16:30,254
um, I have this
one scenario in my mind

439
00:16:30,255 --> 00:16:32,388
that I'm kind of hoping
plays out like this.

440
00:16:32,389 --> 00:16:36,594
Young, sexy, Asian housewife
alone at night, frightened.

441
00:16:36,595 --> 00:16:37,928
A noise out

442
00:16:37,929 --> 00:16:39,263
by the trash cans.

443
00:16:39,264 --> 00:16:41,331
Best call
the neighborhood watch.

444
00:16:41,332 --> 00:16:45,335
I show up, look heroic,
and then... get this...

445
00:16:45,336 --> 00:16:48,407
she sucks my balls.

446
00:16:49,407 --> 00:16:50,740
(makes gunshot noise)

447
00:16:50,741 --> 00:16:52,080
Hear me now!

448
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:57,447
I'm also interested
in that happening to me.

449
00:16:57,448 --> 00:16:58,382
Okay.

450
00:16:58,383 --> 00:17:01,018
Well, Jamarcus, Bob, Franklin,

451
00:17:01,019 --> 00:17:03,754
I guess it doesn't matter
what brought us all here.

452
00:17:03,755 --> 00:17:05,956
What matters is
that we're all united

453
00:17:05,957 --> 00:17:07,290
in one cause.

454
00:17:07,291 --> 00:17:09,161
And with that,
I'd like to welcome you all

455
00:17:09,162 --> 00:17:11,961
to the first
official meeting of...

456
00:17:11,962 --> 00:17:14,565
the neighborhood watch.

457
00:17:14,566 --> 00:17:17,633
Okay, now,

458
00:17:17,634 --> 00:17:21,037
I've taken the liberty
of dividing Glenview

459
00:17:21,038 --> 00:17:23,106
into 12 sectors.

460
00:17:23,107 --> 00:17:24,675
Though some might argue
there are 13,

461
00:17:24,676 --> 00:17:27,310
if you abide by the Yorktown
Zoning Commission ruling.

462
00:17:27,311 --> 00:17:28,577
I'm not buying it,
but then again

463
00:17:28,578 --> 00:17:29,812
I'm not from Honeywell County.

464
00:17:29,813 --> 00:17:30,913
Thank God. Regardless...

465
00:17:30,914 --> 00:17:32,114
BOB:
I'm sorry to be

466
00:17:32,115 --> 00:17:33,582
the squeaky wheel,
but it feels like you have

467
00:17:33,583 --> 00:17:34,584
a lot of dense material

468
00:17:33,584 --> 00:17:34,851
Yeah.

469
00:17:34,852 --> 00:17:35,851
That you're starting

470
00:17:35,852 --> 00:17:36,920
to go through here.

471
00:17:36,921 --> 00:17:38,220
And to be honest with you,
you know,

472
00:17:38,221 --> 00:17:39,788
my house is about
five blocks away,

473
00:17:39,789 --> 00:17:40,922
and I just fixed her up.

474
00:17:40,923 --> 00:17:42,191
Gentlemen, I got drinks,

475
00:17:42,192 --> 00:17:44,162
I got La-Z-Boys,
I got flat-screens,

476
00:17:44,163 --> 00:17:45,460
I got the whole nine.

477
00:17:45,461 --> 00:17:47,130
I know you guys
are gonna love it.

478
00:17:47,131 --> 00:17:48,530
So I just want
to throw it out there.

479
00:17:48,531 --> 00:17:50,232
If I'm overstepping,
just say the word and you're not

480
00:17:50,233 --> 00:17:51,670
gonna hear another squeak
from this little wheel.

481
00:17:51,671 --> 00:17:53,470
Well, honestly...

482
00:17:53,471 --> 00:17:55,106
That sounds a fuck-load
better than this.

483
00:17:55,107 --> 00:17:57,106
No offense.

484
00:17:55,106 --> 00:17:57,207
I don't even know why I'm still
sitting here.

485
00:17:57,208 --> 00:17:58,741
I'm gonna go warm up the car.

486
00:17:58,742 --> 00:18:01,847
You're gonna love this
place; it's awesome.

487
00:18:02,847 --> 00:18:05,114
Gentlemen...

488
00:18:05,115 --> 00:18:07,351
welcome to paradise.

489
00:18:07,352 --> 00:18:08,684
Oh.

490
00:18:08,685 --> 00:18:09,886
Oh! Yes!

491
00:18:09,887 --> 00:18:12,690
I'm a construction manager,
and I built

492
00:18:12,691 --> 00:18:15,425
this little slice of heaven
with my own two hands.

493
00:18:15,426 --> 00:18:17,426
It's so nice. I love it.

494
00:18:15,426 --> 00:18:17,394
Ah, thanks, everyone.

495
00:18:17,395 --> 00:18:18,861
Yeah, I'll set up over there.

496
00:18:18,862 --> 00:18:19,962
You have a pool table.

497
00:18:19,963 --> 00:18:21,165
Yeah. Just got it re-felted.

498
00:18:21,166 --> 00:18:22,700
Go ahead and take her
for a spin.

499
00:18:22,701 --> 00:18:24,701
Here we go.

500
00:18:22,701 --> 00:18:24,300
(chair vibrating)

501
00:18:24,301 --> 00:18:25,701
Hey, you like that thing, huh?

502
00:18:25,702 --> 00:18:27,536
It feels like this chair
is inside me, Robert.

503
00:18:27,537 --> 00:18:29,440
That is the best 2,300 bucks
I ever spent.

504
00:18:29,441 --> 00:18:31,842
I got it at a place
called Relax-the-Back.com.

505
00:18:31,843 --> 00:18:33,777
It's like Toys "R" Us
for your ass and back.

506
00:18:33,778 --> 00:18:35,512
Feels like a thousand
little baby wizards are

507
00:18:35,513 --> 00:18:38,047
massaging my ass cheeks
with their little baby wands.

508
00:18:38,048 --> 00:18:39,448
Powerful imagery, brother!

509
00:18:39,449 --> 00:18:41,049
I'm digging
where he's coming from!

510
00:18:41,050 --> 00:18:42,051
Handbooks. Boom.

511
00:18:41,051 --> 00:18:42,918
Rack them up. I'm in.
What are you drinking?

512
00:18:42,919 --> 00:18:44,690
What's your poison?
You down with scotch?

513
00:18:44,691 --> 00:18:46,690
I... no poison.

514
00:18:44,690 --> 00:18:46,522
Scotch and yes.

515
00:18:46,523 --> 00:18:48,523
No, no, no. No poison.

516
00:18:46,523 --> 00:18:48,225
Scotch and yes?

517
00:18:48,226 --> 00:18:50,226
No.

518
00:18:48,226 --> 00:18:50,393
Scotch and yes!

519
00:18:50,394 --> 00:18:51,727
You know, we got a lot
of ground to cover,

520
00:18:51,728 --> 00:18:53,129
and we're already an hour
behind, so why don't

521
00:18:53,130 --> 00:18:55,400
we just dig in, and then we can
get to whatever afterwards.

522
00:18:55,401 --> 00:18:56,400
Guitar.

523
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:56,933
Ah, come on, Evan.

524
00:18:56,934 --> 00:18:58,669
We're just bonding
a little bit.

525
00:18:58,670 --> 00:19:00,638
Tell me about yourself.
I know you got a wife.

526
00:19:00,639 --> 00:19:02,139
Do you have any kids? How old?

527
00:19:02,140 --> 00:19:03,874
Uh, zero years old.

528
00:19:03,875 --> 00:19:05,875
No kids.

529
00:19:03,875 --> 00:19:05,675
That's a shame.

530
00:19:05,676 --> 00:19:08,880
I couldn't imagine my life
without my little Chelsea.

531
00:19:08,881 --> 00:19:10,847
I mean, being a parent is...

532
00:19:10,848 --> 00:19:11,982
well, it's unbelievable.

533
00:19:11,983 --> 00:19:13,150
That's great.

534
00:19:13,151 --> 00:19:15,019
CHELSEA: Dad, can I go
to a movie at 11:00?

535
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:16,921
Hell, no! It's a weeknight!

536
00:19:16,922 --> 00:19:19,922
But Mandy and Judy are going.

537
00:19:16,922 --> 00:19:19,656
BOB: Mandy?!

538
00:19:19,657 --> 00:19:21,058
Thank you for proving my point!

539
00:19:21,059 --> 00:19:23,294
Mandy's dead weight.
She's a succubus.

540
00:19:23,295 --> 00:19:24,527
I told you that.

541
00:19:24,528 --> 00:19:26,328
Dad, I'm trying to talk
to you like an adult,

542
00:19:26,329 --> 00:19:27,330
and you just...

543
00:19:26,330 --> 00:19:27,664
Don't want to listen!

544
00:19:27,665 --> 00:19:28,831
That's right!
So skedaddle!

545
00:19:28,832 --> 00:19:30,301
Get up there
and do your homework!

546
00:19:30,302 --> 00:19:32,303
Are you serious?!
I fucking hate it here!

547
00:19:32,304 --> 00:19:34,403
Well, I fucking love it here!

548
00:19:34,404 --> 00:19:35,638
That's my little princess.

549
00:19:35,639 --> 00:19:37,073
That's my little angel,
Chelsea, right there.

550
00:19:37,074 --> 00:19:39,310
I'm sorry I didn't get a chance
to introduce you guys.

551
00:19:39,311 --> 00:19:40,844
How about some drinks?

552
00:19:40,845 --> 00:19:42,345
Fresh horses for my men!

553
00:19:42,346 --> 00:19:44,346
Tonight we ride! Get in
here, Frankfurter!

554
00:19:42,346 --> 00:19:44,280
Yes, thank you.

555
00:19:44,281 --> 00:19:45,281
Yeah!

556
00:19:44,281 --> 00:19:45,783
I don't...

557
00:19:45,784 --> 00:19:46,783
Come on, Evaroo.

558
00:19:46,784 --> 00:19:47,685
No, thanks.

559
00:19:47,686 --> 00:19:49,185
You'll be bummed if you don't.

560
00:19:49,186 --> 00:19:50,186
No, I don't...

561
00:19:49,186 --> 00:19:50,885
Can I interest anyone
in some finger foods?

562
00:19:50,886 --> 00:19:52,723
I got to order some pies
up in this thing, right?

563
00:19:52,724 --> 00:19:54,723
You guys want some pies?

564
00:19:52,723 --> 00:19:54,458
Okay, you know what?

565
00:19:54,459 --> 00:19:56,193
You guys got your own thing
going on there.

566
00:19:56,194 --> 00:19:57,928
I am going to

567
00:19:57,929 --> 00:19:58,794
put up some flyers.

568
00:19:58,795 --> 00:19:59,796
Come on, have one drink.

569
00:19:58,796 --> 00:19:59,930
No.

570
00:19:59,931 --> 00:20:01,030
Bye.

571
00:20:01,031 --> 00:20:02,031
No?

572
00:20:01,031 --> 00:20:02,500
All right, I'll see you guys.

573
00:20:02,501 --> 00:20:03,500
Okay.

574
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:03,566
See you.

575
00:20:03,567 --> 00:20:05,567
Hey, see you tomorrow night.

576
00:20:03,567 --> 00:20:05,201
Okay.

577
00:20:05,202 --> 00:20:07,211
Same Bob time, same Bob place.

578
00:20:14,211 --> 00:20:16,413
Hey, fella!

579
00:20:16,414 --> 00:20:18,414
What are you doing?

580
00:20:16,414 --> 00:20:18,082
Ah.

581
00:20:18,083 --> 00:20:19,149
There you are.

582
00:20:19,150 --> 00:20:21,585
1162 Jerome Park Drive.

583
00:20:21,586 --> 00:20:22,819
Excuse me?

584
00:20:22,820 --> 00:20:25,422
I'm 1157 Jerome Park Drive.

585
00:20:25,423 --> 00:20:26,922
Name's Paul.
Just moved in.

586
00:20:26,923 --> 00:20:29,192
Oh! You're... oh.

587
00:20:29,193 --> 00:20:30,193
Oh, sorry.

588
00:20:30,194 --> 00:20:31,627
I'm, uh, I'm Evan.

589
00:20:31,628 --> 00:20:32,630
Hi.

590
00:20:32,631 --> 00:20:33,897
Evan.

591
00:20:33,898 --> 00:20:36,666
Evan Trautwig, subscriber
to Men's Fitness.

592
00:20:36,667 --> 00:20:39,937
Oh, yeah, that's... that is...
yeah, that's mine.

593
00:20:39,938 --> 00:20:40,937
Thank you.

594
00:20:40,938 --> 00:20:42,239
Not that you need it.

595
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:43,906
Excuse me?

596
00:20:43,907 --> 00:20:47,114
You got the body of
a decathlete, Evan.

597
00:20:49,114 --> 00:20:50,916
And you got great skin.

598
00:20:51,916 --> 00:20:55,685
You live here alone
in this big old house?

599
00:20:55,686 --> 00:20:57,053
No. No.

600
00:20:57,054 --> 00:20:59,189
I live with my wife.

601
00:20:59,190 --> 00:21:00,462
My female wife Abby.

602
00:21:05,462 --> 00:21:07,097
I'm gonna go inside now.

603
00:21:07,098 --> 00:21:09,133
Mm. All right,
Evan Trautwig.

604
00:21:09,134 --> 00:21:10,866
Nice to meet you.

605
00:21:10,867 --> 00:21:12,368
Stay fit.

606
00:21:12,369 --> 00:21:13,770
Evan Trautwig!

607
00:21:13,771 --> 00:21:15,343
Yeah.

608
00:21:18,343 --> 00:21:21,678
<i>ABBY:
It was really cute.</i>

609
00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:23,080
We all got our own puff paints

610
00:21:23,081 --> 00:21:25,348
and made these little
customized onesies.

611
00:21:25,349 --> 00:21:27,250
Oh, wow.

612
00:21:27,251 --> 00:21:28,518
Okay.

613
00:21:28,519 --> 00:21:29,886
So you started another club.

614
00:21:29,887 --> 00:21:30,887
No.

615
00:21:30,888 --> 00:21:31,957
It's not a club,

616
00:21:31,958 --> 00:21:33,957
it's a task force
of concerned citizens.

617
00:21:33,958 --> 00:21:36,226
I went to the Spartans game
and made a speech,

618
00:21:36,227 --> 00:21:37,962
and the community
really responded.

619
00:21:37,963 --> 00:21:42,766
Well, guess who peed on the
ovulation stick on the plane?

620
00:21:42,767 --> 00:21:43,767
You?

621
00:21:43,768 --> 00:21:45,302
Yep.

622
00:21:45,303 --> 00:21:47,370
It's kind of faint, but I
think there's two pink lines.

623
00:21:47,371 --> 00:21:48,638
Yeah, I can't tell.

624
00:21:48,639 --> 00:21:50,540
Well, I think we
should do it anyway.

625
00:21:50,541 --> 00:21:52,540
I would love to do it.

626
00:21:50,540 --> 00:21:52,242
Just to be safe.

627
00:21:52,243 --> 00:21:53,543
Mm-mm-mm.

628
00:21:53,544 --> 00:21:55,278
But I got to go meet

629
00:21:55,279 --> 00:21:57,048
the neighborhood watch guys
for a patrol.

630
00:21:57,049 --> 00:21:59,783
Evan! You promised.

631
00:21:59,784 --> 00:22:01,785
I know, but I also
promised Antonio's family

632
00:22:01,786 --> 00:22:03,987
that I would catch his killer.

633
00:22:03,988 --> 00:22:05,422
I made a vow.

634
00:22:05,423 --> 00:22:06,421
Okay, okay, okay...

635
00:22:06,422 --> 00:22:07,724
It's a great group of guys.

636
00:22:07,725 --> 00:22:09,993
Really.
I'm very excited.

637
00:22:09,994 --> 00:22:11,394
Here we go.

638
00:22:11,395 --> 00:22:12,596
Bad-ass jackets for the watch.

639
00:22:12,597 --> 00:22:14,331
I went to the mall
this morning,

640
00:22:14,332 --> 00:22:15,331
and I had them made up.

641
00:22:15,332 --> 00:22:16,334
Get them while they're hot.

642
00:22:16,335 --> 00:22:17,334
- Blam.
- Let's do it.

643
00:22:16,334 --> 00:22:17,601
Whoa.

644
00:22:17,602 --> 00:22:18,602
What?

645
00:22:17,602 --> 00:22:18,768
Thank you.

646
00:22:18,769 --> 00:22:20,769
Got your names on them.

647
00:22:18,769 --> 00:22:20,403
Got our names on them.

648
00:22:20,404 --> 00:22:21,404
Yep.

649
00:22:20,404 --> 00:22:21,938
All right, Bob.

650
00:22:21,939 --> 00:22:23,073
This is great.

651
00:22:23,074 --> 00:22:24,074
These are good.

652
00:22:23,074 --> 00:22:24,842
Okay.

653
00:22:24,843 --> 00:22:26,611
Hey, what-what happened
to my logo?

654
00:22:26,612 --> 00:22:29,746
Oh, this is, this is
just like your initial logo,

655
00:22:29,747 --> 00:22:31,114
only now it's awesome.

656
00:22:31,115 --> 00:22:32,849
This has nothing to do
with my original logo.

657
00:22:32,850 --> 00:22:35,885
My logo was an eye that was
watching over the neighborhood.

658
00:22:35,886 --> 00:22:37,754
I don't know what this is.

659
00:22:37,755 --> 00:22:39,690
What, a tiger with wings?

660
00:22:39,691 --> 00:22:40,489
Exactly!

661
00:22:40,490 --> 00:22:41,492
This is a tiger,

662
00:22:41,493 --> 00:22:43,093
who's fierce and sleek.

663
00:22:43,094 --> 00:22:45,096
But it's got wings, so it flies
above the neighborhood,

664
00:22:45,097 --> 00:22:47,998
and if it sees a domestic
problem, it kills it!

665
00:22:47,999 --> 00:22:49,500
The other thing is,
your original one's here.

666
00:22:49,501 --> 00:22:51,500
So I think...

667
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:51,768
Got the eye right
there on the side.

668
00:22:51,769 --> 00:22:53,769
It's always on the side.

669
00:22:51,769 --> 00:22:53,304
Small on the side.

670
00:22:53,305 --> 00:22:55,638
That's weird, 'cause it's like
an eye on the shoulder,

671
00:22:55,639 --> 00:22:57,008
but there's a tiger
on your back.

672
00:22:57,009 --> 00:22:58,008
Weird how?

673
00:22:57,008 --> 00:22:58,508
What are we,
the flaming tigers?

674
00:22:58,509 --> 00:23:00,477
'Cause that's what
it looks like.

675
00:23:00,478 --> 00:23:02,011
We're the flaming,
flying tigers.

676
00:23:02,012 --> 00:23:03,646
It makes no sense.

677
00:23:03,647 --> 00:23:04,646
Are you out of your mind?!

678
00:23:04,647 --> 00:23:06,116
This is inspiring
for the watch!

679
00:23:06,117 --> 00:23:09,085
Whenever you have a
tiger, flames and wings,

680
00:23:09,086 --> 00:23:10,621
all in the same logo,

681
00:23:10,622 --> 00:23:13,556
it's like the Chinese symbol for
"Shut the fuck up and dance!"

682
00:23:13,557 --> 00:23:15,325
This is inspiring
for the watch!

683
00:23:15,326 --> 00:23:17,093
I don't know.
What are we, in a doo-wop group?

684
00:23:17,094 --> 00:23:18,626
We're gonna, like,
stand over a garbage can

685
00:23:18,627 --> 00:23:19,798
with fire and harmonize?

686
00:23:19,799 --> 00:23:21,331
I would see this doo-wop group.

687
00:23:21,332 --> 00:23:22,631
Hey, for your information,

688
00:23:22,632 --> 00:23:24,568
doo-wop groups
were known to close ass.

689
00:23:24,569 --> 00:23:27,304
Singing was their hobby,
closing ass was their job.

690
00:23:27,305 --> 00:23:28,603
The baritone from
Boyz II Men had to

691
00:23:28,604 --> 00:23:30,074
stop making music
'cause he got so much pussy.

692
00:23:30,075 --> 00:23:32,074
- Thank you.
- They're like ass collectors.

693
00:23:32,075 --> 00:23:34,009
This is not about fashion,
this is about brotherhood,

694
00:23:34,010 --> 00:23:35,111
this is about solidarity.

695
00:23:35,112 --> 00:23:36,679
You should get that
more than anybody.

696
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:37,680
He's actually right.

697
00:23:37,681 --> 00:23:38,680
Pigs have uniforms,

698
00:23:38,681 --> 00:23:40,218
I think we should
have uniforms, too.

699
00:23:40,219 --> 00:23:42,485
We got to match those fuckers
on every level.

700
00:23:42,486 --> 00:23:44,086
Understand?
Every level.

701
00:23:44,087 --> 00:23:45,454
Can I just say, Bob,

702
00:23:45,455 --> 00:23:48,024
that these are the shit.

703
00:23:48,025 --> 00:23:49,425
Just the shit.

704
00:23:49,426 --> 00:23:53,232
These are just shit.

705
00:23:55,232 --> 00:23:57,166
Okay, you know what, fine.

706
00:23:57,167 --> 00:23:58,300
I'll wear it.

707
00:23:58,301 --> 00:24:00,238
But you have to
promise me that tonight

708
00:24:00,239 --> 00:24:02,572
we're actually gonna
do something, okay?

709
00:24:02,573 --> 00:24:03,573
Absolutely.

710
00:24:02,573 --> 00:24:03,740
For sure.

711
00:24:03,741 --> 00:24:05,742
Gentlemen, we're part of
more than a club,

712
00:24:05,743 --> 00:24:07,277
we're part of a way of life.

713
00:24:07,278 --> 00:24:08,611
We're making a
commitment to ourselves

714
00:24:08,612 --> 00:24:09,679
and to the watch today.

715
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:10,813
Get your hands in here, Evan.

716
00:24:10,814 --> 00:24:12,014
Get that pretty hand in there.

717
00:24:12,015 --> 00:24:13,651
On three, let me
hear you sing it out

718
00:24:13,652 --> 00:24:15,419
with pride in your hearts.

719
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:16,587
Neighborhood watch.

720
00:24:16,588 --> 00:24:18,255
One, two, three.

721
00:24:18,256 --> 00:24:19,526
ALL:
Neighborhood watch!

722
00:24:21,526 --> 00:24:23,124
<i>FRANKLIN:
Yeah, this is boring.</i>

723
00:24:23,125 --> 00:24:24,395
<i>BOB:
Yeah, Franklin's right.</i>

724
00:24:24,396 --> 00:24:26,462
We're not gonna sit
here all night, are we?

725
00:24:26,463 --> 00:24:27,464
Yeah, guys, we are.

726
00:24:27,465 --> 00:24:29,464
Really?

727
00:24:27,464 --> 00:24:29,199
If we need to.

728
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:30,335
It's a stakeout.

729
00:24:30,336 --> 00:24:32,134
BOB:
I don't mean to

730
00:24:32,135 --> 00:24:34,036
sound childish,
but I do have to pee.

731
00:24:34,037 --> 00:24:36,007
You should've peed
earlier. I'm sorry.

732
00:24:36,008 --> 00:24:38,008
As an adult, you're just
gonna have to hold it.

733
00:24:38,009 --> 00:24:40,410
How you doing, Jamarcus?

734
00:24:40,411 --> 00:24:41,411
Ready.

735
00:24:40,411 --> 00:24:41,979
I still have to pee.

736
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:43,379
You know, the liquid comes in,
the liquid's

737
00:24:43,380 --> 00:24:44,581
got to come out; I got to piss.

738
00:24:44,582 --> 00:24:45,682
Here. Why don't you
just pee in this.

739
00:24:45,683 --> 00:24:46,682
Oh, great.

740
00:24:46,683 --> 00:24:47,683
That's a good idea.

741
00:24:47,684 --> 00:24:48,786
No, no, don't pee in that.

742
00:24:48,787 --> 00:24:50,786
I got to mount up.

743
00:24:48,786 --> 00:24:50,220
What are you doing?

744
00:24:50,221 --> 00:24:51,221
No, don't...

745
00:24:50,221 --> 00:24:51,386
I'm mounting up to piss.

746
00:24:51,387 --> 00:24:52,388
You're not gonna pee in a can.

747
00:24:51,388 --> 00:24:52,957
Why not?

748
00:24:52,958 --> 00:24:54,958
No, Bob.

749
00:24:52,958 --> 00:24:54,123
I'm not gonna miss anything.

750
00:24:54,124 --> 00:24:55,393
I'm a good shot,
I'm gonna get it perfect.

751
00:24:55,394 --> 00:24:57,393
Open the door.

752
00:24:55,393 --> 00:24:57,193
I've taken lots of road trips.

753
00:24:57,194 --> 00:24:59,194
I've always done this shit.

754
00:24:57,194 --> 00:24:59,129
No, piss out the door.

755
00:24:59,130 --> 00:25:00,631
And blow our-our
stakeout position? No shot.

756
00:25:00,632 --> 00:25:03,631
You're not gonna pee in a can.

757
00:25:00,631 --> 00:25:03,166
I'd never hear the end of it

758
00:25:03,167 --> 00:25:05,200
from you if I blew our stakeout
position; there's no shot.

759
00:25:05,201 --> 00:25:06,770
So I got to mount up.
I'm mounting up.

760
00:25:06,771 --> 00:25:08,137
Okay, and we're going.

761
00:25:08,138 --> 00:25:09,138
Oh, my God, we're going.

762
00:25:08,138 --> 00:25:09,772
You're in.

763
00:25:09,773 --> 00:25:11,773
Oh, my God, we're going.

764
00:25:09,773 --> 00:25:11,275
(urine sloshing)

765
00:25:11,276 --> 00:25:13,977
This is almost like... I've had
to pee so bad for so long,

766
00:25:13,978 --> 00:25:15,279
it's borderline sexual, Evaroo.

767
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:17,279
I'm not missing, either.

768
00:25:15,279 --> 00:25:17,247
It's so controlled.

769
00:25:17,248 --> 00:25:18,848
I mean, it's incredibly
controlled, Evan.

770
00:25:18,849 --> 00:25:20,848
It's like he's threading
a needle.

771
00:25:18,848 --> 00:25:20,316
I know I'm okay

772
00:25:20,317 --> 00:25:22,383
'cause I can feel the steel
right around the tip.

773
00:25:22,384 --> 00:25:23,786
I'm squishing it against it.

774
00:25:23,787 --> 00:25:25,453
I got the mushroom pushed
right against the cold steel.

775
00:25:25,454 --> 00:25:27,090
Bob, hit me with a beat.
Hit me with a stop and go.

776
00:25:27,091 --> 00:25:29,090
Stop it. Make it happen.

777
00:25:27,090 --> 00:25:29,293
(urine stopping and starting)

778
00:25:29,294 --> 00:25:31,126
Stop it.
Make it happen.

779
00:25:31,127 --> 00:25:31,127
- Stop it.
- Uh-huh.

780
00:25:31,930 --> 00:25:33,930
Make it happen.

781
00:25:31,930 --> 00:25:33,262
(sighs)

782
00:25:33,263 --> 00:25:34,730
Killing it.

783
00:25:34,731 --> 00:25:35,799
And we're done.

784
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:36,799
Good.

785
00:25:35,799 --> 00:25:36,832
Well done. Well done.

786
00:25:36,833 --> 00:25:37,999
Oh, thank you.
That was a good one.

787
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,971
Would you be a pal
and hold this for me?

788
00:25:39,972 --> 00:25:41,971
Oh, come on! Come on!

789
00:25:39,971 --> 00:25:41,504
Just so I can get repositioned.

790
00:25:41,505 --> 00:25:42,505
That's enough!

791
00:25:41,505 --> 00:25:42,772
Come on!

792
00:25:42,773 --> 00:25:44,975
I'm busting your chain!
I'm busting your chain!

793
00:25:44,976 --> 00:25:47,277
Hey, did I miss anything
while I was pissing?

794
00:25:47,278 --> 00:25:48,412
Did we catch the killer?

795
00:25:48,413 --> 00:25:49,412
(laughs)

796
00:25:49,413 --> 00:25:50,814
Lighten up, big guy!

797
00:25:50,815 --> 00:25:53,482
I'm glad you think
this is so funny, Bob.

798
00:25:53,483 --> 00:25:56,052
I'm glad you think this
is a laugh riot, okay?

799
00:25:56,053 --> 00:25:58,822
Let's all have a laugh while
Antonio Guzman's killer

800
00:25:58,823 --> 00:26:00,422
continues to roam free.

801
00:26:00,423 --> 00:26:02,125
You know what?

802
00:26:02,126 --> 00:26:03,226
He's right.

803
00:26:03,227 --> 00:26:04,929
That sicko's probably
out there right now,

804
00:26:04,930 --> 00:26:07,029
staring at us from a distance,

805
00:26:07,030 --> 00:26:08,965
beating the living shit
out of his dick,

806
00:26:08,966 --> 00:26:11,468
reliving his sick fantasy.

807
00:26:11,469 --> 00:26:13,569
(can pops)

808
00:26:13,570 --> 00:26:15,271
What are you doing?

809
00:26:15,272 --> 00:26:16,240
Popping a top.

810
00:26:16,241 --> 00:26:18,074
No, no, you can't do that.

811
00:26:18,075 --> 00:26:19,075
Why not?

812
00:26:18,075 --> 00:26:19,643
It's against the law.

813
00:26:19,644 --> 00:26:22,312
It's illegal. You can't have
open alcohol in the car.

814
00:26:22,313 --> 00:26:23,411
The car's not moving.

815
00:26:23,412 --> 00:26:24,846
There's not even a key
in the ignition.

816
00:26:24,847 --> 00:26:25,847
Doesn't matter, it's still...

817
00:26:25,848 --> 00:26:27,283
Franklin, you failed
the police test.

818
00:26:27,284 --> 00:26:28,286
Is this illegal?

819
00:26:28,287 --> 00:26:29,685
It's definitely illegal.

820
00:26:29,686 --> 00:26:32,322
But I also failed the boring
test, you know what I'm saying?

821
00:26:32,323 --> 00:26:33,323
I dig it.

822
00:26:32,323 --> 00:26:33,522
Hook me up.

823
00:26:33,523 --> 00:26:34,791
My guy.

824
00:26:34,792 --> 00:26:37,258
# I'm gonna drink this
little, little cervezas. #

825
00:26:37,259 --> 00:26:38,295
All right, Jamarky-Mark.

826
00:26:38,296 --> 00:26:39,863
Cannonball coming at you!

827
00:26:39,864 --> 00:26:40,864
Coming in hot.

828
00:26:40,865 --> 00:26:42,163
Evaroo?
Want to hold off?

829
00:26:42,164 --> 00:26:43,165
I don't blame you;
You're driving.

830
00:26:42,165 --> 00:26:43,633
Cheers.

831
00:26:43,634 --> 00:26:44,968
Hey, to great times.

832
00:26:44,969 --> 00:26:45,968
And doing it right.

833
00:26:45,969 --> 00:26:47,036
JAMARCUS:
To criminality.

834
00:26:47,037 --> 00:26:48,403
FRANKLIN: # Evan,
taste these cervezas. #

835
00:26:48,404 --> 00:26:49,404
Maybe a little...

836
00:26:49,405 --> 00:26:50,406
Keep it low, guys.

837
00:26:49,406 --> 00:26:50,440
Oh, shit.

838
00:26:50,441 --> 00:26:51,539
Seriously, put it low,
put it low.

839
00:26:51,540 --> 00:26:53,109
Put it between your knees.
Even lower.

840
00:26:53,110 --> 00:26:54,543
<i>I've been here many times,
trust me.</i>

841
00:26:54,544 --> 00:26:56,644
<i>Act like there's nothing
going on, you're fine.</i>

842
00:26:56,645 --> 00:26:57,882
FRANKLIN (whispering):
Fucking guys.

843
00:26:57,883 --> 00:26:59,618
I hate these motherfuckers.

844
00:27:01,618 --> 00:27:03,220
Hello, Officers.

845
00:27:03,221 --> 00:27:04,219
Evening, gentlemen.

846
00:27:04,220 --> 00:27:05,022
Doing a little cruising?

847
00:27:05,023 --> 00:27:06,957
EVAN:
No, Officers.

848
00:27:06,958 --> 00:27:10,893
We're actually on, uh...
neighborhood watch business.

849
00:27:10,894 --> 00:27:12,496
Hide your bong, Chucho.

850
00:27:12,497 --> 00:27:14,764
Neighborhood watch is here.

851
00:27:14,765 --> 00:27:18,034
Sergeant, you remember me?

852
00:27:18,035 --> 00:27:19,135
SERGEANT:
No.

853
00:27:19,136 --> 00:27:20,903
What, have I
arrested you before?

854
00:27:20,904 --> 00:27:22,872
Not so good with faces.

855
00:27:22,873 --> 00:27:24,374
(mutters):
Faces.

856
00:27:24,375 --> 00:27:25,274
You're a cop.

857
00:27:25,275 --> 00:27:26,309
What do you mean you're not...

858
00:27:26,310 --> 00:27:28,510
You're not good
with faces? What?!

859
00:27:28,511 --> 00:27:29,780
I don't see the connection.

860
00:27:29,781 --> 00:27:32,415
What I have been seeing
are these babies.

861
00:27:32,416 --> 00:27:33,616
How's it been going?

862
00:27:33,617 --> 00:27:35,317
Good, actually.

863
00:27:35,318 --> 00:27:36,519
Very good.

864
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:37,520
Great.

865
00:27:37,521 --> 00:27:38,720
Yeah, we thought
we'd start here

866
00:27:38,721 --> 00:27:40,290
at the Costco and stake
it out for a while.

867
00:27:40,291 --> 00:27:41,790
'Cause, as you
know, most killers

868
00:27:41,791 --> 00:27:43,327
return to the scene
of the crime, so...

869
00:27:43,328 --> 00:27:45,060
Oh, of course they do.

870
00:27:45,061 --> 00:27:48,397
The killer always returns
to the scene of the crime.

871
00:27:48,398 --> 00:27:50,033
So, uh,

872
00:27:50,034 --> 00:27:52,969
fancy seeing you here,
Trautwig.

873
00:27:52,970 --> 00:27:54,637
At the scene of the crime.

874
00:27:54,638 --> 00:27:56,539
I don't know what that means.

875
00:27:56,540 --> 00:27:59,876
It means it's super-suspicious
that you're here right now.

876
00:27:59,877 --> 00:28:02,712
And it makes me feel like
you have some secrets.

877
00:28:02,713 --> 00:28:04,547
Well, I don't.

878
00:28:04,548 --> 00:28:06,281
(clicks pen)

879
00:28:06,282 --> 00:28:09,552
Any-who, when you fellas
finish playing Hardy Boys,

880
00:28:09,553 --> 00:28:11,320
don't forget to pay this ticket

881
00:28:11,321 --> 00:28:13,596
for those open
alcohol containers.

882
00:28:18,596 --> 00:28:19,962
SERGEANT:
And...

883
00:28:19,963 --> 00:28:23,066
this one is for putting up
200 flyers without a permit.

884
00:28:23,067 --> 00:28:23,867
What?!

885
00:28:23,968 --> 00:28:25,304
I'm sorry, guys.

886
00:28:27,304 --> 00:28:29,772
You fellas have a safe night.

887
00:28:29,773 --> 00:28:31,473
Hit it, Chucho.

888
00:28:31,474 --> 00:28:34,247
(siren whoops)

889
00:28:36,247 --> 00:28:38,515
Goddamn it!

890
00:28:38,516 --> 00:28:39,780
I know he remembers me!

891
00:28:39,781 --> 00:28:41,116
He's just messing with my head!

892
00:28:41,117 --> 00:28:42,386
You can't drink
in your car anymore?

893
00:28:42,387 --> 00:28:44,520
What the hell is
this country coming to?

894
00:28:44,521 --> 00:28:46,589
(cell phone ringtone playing)

895
00:28:46,590 --> 00:28:48,591
Evan Trautwig.

896
00:28:48,592 --> 00:28:51,495
Yes, of course.

897
00:28:51,496 --> 00:28:54,765
Noise complaint at
the football field.

898
00:28:54,766 --> 00:28:56,999
This is it, guys.

899
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,969
It's our first call.

900
00:28:58,970 --> 00:29:00,737
Hell, yeah. Let's roll!

901
00:29:00,738 --> 00:29:02,873
Let's do it.

902
00:29:02,874 --> 00:29:05,881
(engine starts)

903
00:29:09,881 --> 00:29:12,759
(tires screeching)

904
00:29:22,759 --> 00:29:25,228
You see anything?

905
00:29:25,229 --> 00:29:26,634
Uh-uh.

906
00:29:29,634 --> 00:29:31,634
Hello?

907
00:29:29,634 --> 00:29:31,467
What the hell?

908
00:29:31,468 --> 00:29:32,435
Turn off the lights!

909
00:29:32,436 --> 00:29:34,136
(grunting)

910
00:29:34,137 --> 00:29:35,137
What?!

911
00:29:34,137 --> 00:29:35,404
I'm hit!

912
00:29:35,405 --> 00:29:37,306
What the fuck is going on?!

913
00:29:37,307 --> 00:29:39,175
Robert, we're getting
ambushed here!

914
00:29:39,176 --> 00:29:41,175
They're kids!

915
00:29:39,175 --> 00:29:41,044
Eggs!

916
00:29:41,045 --> 00:29:42,510
Yeah, we're getting egged!
It's raining eggs!

917
00:29:42,511 --> 00:29:43,646
We came to help!

918
00:29:43,647 --> 00:29:45,248
Yolk's on you, ass wipes!

919
00:29:45,249 --> 00:29:47,451
Yolk's on me?!
A fucking pun?!

920
00:29:47,452 --> 00:29:49,519
I'm gonna kill this kid.

921
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:51,520
I'm gonna kill you!

922
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:51,287
Goddamn it!

923
00:29:51,288 --> 00:29:53,356
They're getting away, Bob!

924
00:29:53,357 --> 00:29:54,357
No, they're not.

925
00:29:54,358 --> 00:29:56,058
Because one of us
is the founder

926
00:29:56,059 --> 00:29:58,269
of the Glenview Running Club!

927
00:30:05,269 --> 00:30:07,269
(yells)

928
00:30:07,270 --> 00:30:10,038

929
00:30:10,039 --> 00:30:11,208
Yeah, you fucked him up, man!

930
00:30:11,209 --> 00:30:12,741
BOB:
Who's laughing now, kid?

931
00:30:12,742 --> 00:30:15,412
I bet you didn't egg-pect
to get your ass kicked.

932
00:30:15,413 --> 00:30:17,345
Huh? You throw eggs at people,
you think that's funny?

933
00:30:17,346 --> 00:30:18,680
Look how much pain he's in.

934
00:30:18,681 --> 00:30:19,916
Guess what you learned tonight.

935
00:30:19,917 --> 00:30:22,552
You don't mess with
the neighborhood watch, baby!

936
00:30:22,553 --> 00:30:23,952
Undefeated!

937
00:30:23,953 --> 00:30:25,953
Come on.

938
00:30:23,953 --> 00:30:25,721
Look at Evaroo

939
00:30:25,722 --> 00:30:27,556
with the high hands!

940
00:30:27,557 --> 00:30:28,557
(screams)

941
00:30:27,557 --> 00:30:28,958
Whoa!

942
00:30:28,959 --> 00:30:30,559
We got him!
We got him!

943
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:32,095
(all shouting)

944
00:30:32,096 --> 00:30:33,328
# La-da-da-da-da #

945
00:30:33,329 --> 00:30:34,798
# It's the motherfucking

946
00:30:34,799 --> 00:30:37,100
# Snoop Dogg! #

947
00:30:37,101 --> 00:30:38,500
# La-da-da-da-da #

948
00:30:38,501 --> 00:30:40,702
# You know I'm mobbin'
with the D-R-E #

949
00:30:40,703 --> 00:30:42,072
# Yeah, yeah, yeah #

950
00:30:42,073 --> 00:30:46,075
# You know who's back up
in this motherfucker #

951
00:30:46,076 --> 00:30:47,545
# What, what, what, what. #

952
00:30:47,546 --> 00:30:48,979
Ha-ha!

953
00:30:48,980 --> 00:30:50,113
That's right.

954
00:30:50,114 --> 00:30:51,980
Neighborhood Watch.

955
00:30:51,981 --> 00:30:54,383
Suck a fat dick, Chucho.

956
00:30:54,384 --> 00:30:56,452
What's going on here, guys?

957
00:30:56,453 --> 00:30:58,587
Egging, Sergeant.

958
00:30:58,588 --> 00:30:59,757
Guy's an egger.

959
00:30:59,758 --> 00:31:00,990
Eggs, huh?

960
00:31:00,991 --> 00:31:03,125
Yeah, eggs:
The coward's weapon.

961
00:31:03,126 --> 00:31:04,494
It's good you brought him in.

962
00:31:04,495 --> 00:31:08,531
Then he tried to run away
on his little skitter-board.

963
00:31:08,532 --> 00:31:09,566
Did you really?

964
00:31:09,567 --> 00:31:10,666
Hmm?

965
00:31:10,667 --> 00:31:13,536
Get back to the playground
and the monkey bars.

966
00:31:13,537 --> 00:31:16,338
You think it's nice to
throw eggs at people?

967
00:31:16,339 --> 00:31:17,239
Do you?

968
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:19,475
You gonna answer the question?

969
00:31:19,476 --> 00:31:20,876
It's rude.

970
00:31:20,877 --> 00:31:23,213
It hurts people's feelings
and it hurts their faces.

971
00:31:23,214 --> 00:31:26,281
And now you deal with
the consequences.

972
00:31:26,282 --> 00:31:27,952
Homegirl's trying
to make an omelet.

973
00:31:27,953 --> 00:31:29,952
Yeah, look at me.

974
00:31:27,952 --> 00:31:29,486
Look at his face.

975
00:31:29,487 --> 00:31:30,451
Look at my face.

976
00:31:30,452 --> 00:31:31,687
Look at his face
and listen to me.

977
00:31:31,688 --> 00:31:32,653
Look at him and listen to me.

978
00:31:32,654 --> 00:31:34,090
Look at him and understand me.

979
00:31:34,091 --> 00:31:35,926
Look at both of us,
but understand no one.

980
00:31:35,927 --> 00:31:38,193
Listen to my words
and hear his face.

981
00:31:38,194 --> 00:31:39,194
EVAN:
Do you think it is funny

982
00:31:39,195 --> 00:31:40,595
to throw an egg
in somebody's face?

983
00:31:40,596 --> 00:31:41,830
FRANKLIN: You think it's funny?
You think it's a yolk?

984
00:31:41,831 --> 00:31:43,164
I'll shove a full egg
inside your asshole

985
00:31:43,165 --> 00:31:44,234
and watch it hatch.

986
00:31:44,235 --> 00:31:46,234
Franklin. Inappropriate.

987
00:31:44,234 --> 00:31:46,169
Sorry.

988
00:31:46,170 --> 00:31:47,671
No, I understand, it's too far.

989
00:31:47,672 --> 00:31:48,770
Sorry.

990
00:31:48,771 --> 00:31:51,107
She's all yours.

991
00:31:51,108 --> 00:31:53,945
Great work.

992
00:31:54,945 --> 00:31:57,419
Here's your bag.

993
00:32:01,419 --> 00:32:04,120
Well, that was super weird.

994
00:32:04,121 --> 00:32:05,956
Am I under arrest?

995
00:32:05,957 --> 00:32:07,590
Of course not.
Those guys are a joke.

996
00:32:07,591 --> 00:32:09,593
Okay, can one of you guys give
me a ride home or something?

997
00:32:09,594 --> 00:32:10,661
Fuck no.

998
00:32:10,662 --> 00:32:11,863
I'm not a chauffer
and neither is

999
00:32:11,864 --> 00:32:13,529
Chucho over here, right, buddy?

1000
00:32:13,530 --> 00:32:14,566
Get out of here.

1001
00:32:15,566 --> 00:32:17,282
Real nice.

1002
00:32:32,282 --> 00:32:34,118

1003
00:32:35,118 --> 00:32:36,522

Okay, yeah.

1007
00:32:46,596 --> 00:32:48,030
Really hilarious!

1008
00:32:48,031 --> 00:32:49,198
Hey, quit screwing around!

1009
00:32:49,199 --> 00:32:50,299
I'm gonna pelt somebody!

1010

1011
00:32:52,603 --> 00:32:54,202
Screw you!

00:32:54,203 --> 00:32:55,577

Why did you take your eyes
off the road to sing?

There's open alcohol,
we're inebriated,

I have weed in my pocket.

1057

hit some freakishly
big fly or something.

1081
00:35:08,205 --> 00:35:10,238
some freshly caught octopus

1082
00:35:10,239 --> 00:35:13,009
to a nearby sushi
establishment.

1083
00:35:13,010 --> 00:35:14,877
It's octopus, and a fresh one.

1084
00:35:14,878 --> 00:35:17,645
Right, you got nothing but the
thing and the octopus and this,

1085
00:35:17,646 --> 00:35:20,216
and I think we pack it in
and we know what happened.

1086
00:35:20,217 --> 00:35:22,252
Okay, worst-case scenario:

1087
00:35:22,253 --> 00:35:24,019
Evan murdered a Japanese man
who was eating octopus

1088
00:35:24,020 --> 00:35:26,019
while crossing the street.

1089
00:35:24,019 --> 00:35:26,089
Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa...

1090
00:35:26,090 --> 00:35:27,090
I didn't... come on,

1091
00:35:27,091 --> 00:35:28,857
I did not murder anybody.

1092
00:35:28,858 --> 00:35:29,927
Doesn't matter.

1093
00:35:29,928 --> 00:35:31,326
You know why?

1094
00:35:31,327 --> 00:35:33,394
'Cause no one's going to say
shit about this to anybody

1095
00:35:33,395 --> 00:35:34,565
'cause we don't dime

1096
00:35:34,566 --> 00:35:36,735
on our fellow neighborhood
watchers, okay?

1097
00:35:38,735 --> 00:35:40,770
Wait a second,
I've seen this stuff before.

1098
00:35:40,771 --> 00:35:43,671
Back at Costco, this was
the stuff by Antonio's body.

1099
00:35:43,672 --> 00:35:46,274
Had he just won a Nickelodeon's
Kids' Choice Award?

1100
00:35:46,275 --> 00:35:47,810
Franklin, he was dead.

1101
00:35:47,811 --> 00:35:49,811
So he wasn't eligible.

1102
00:35:47,811 --> 00:35:49,645
That's pretty amazing, then,

1103
00:35:49,646 --> 00:35:51,382
that he won 'cause usually
you have to do some sort

1104
00:35:51,383 --> 00:35:54,753
of kids type thing
to win that award.

1105
00:35:56,753 --> 00:35:58,553
Feels like cum.

1106
00:35:58,554 --> 00:35:59,554
Ew.

1107
00:35:58,554 --> 00:35:59,855
Well, I dare anyone

1108
00:35:59,856 --> 00:36:01,858
to touch it and tell me
it doesn't feel like cum.

1109
00:36:01,859 --> 00:36:03,558
May I?

1110
00:36:03,559 --> 00:36:05,495
Yeah, that's cum.

1111
00:36:05,496 --> 00:36:06,729
Well, it's green, it's not cum,
but I'm saying

1112
00:36:06,730 --> 00:36:07,931
it's a cum...
it feels like cum.

1113
00:36:07,932 --> 00:36:10,066
The texture, the flavor,

1114
00:36:10,067 --> 00:36:11,935
the color, the consistency...

1115
00:36:11,936 --> 00:36:14,837
It's very cum-like.

1116
00:36:14,838 --> 00:36:16,906
Hey, guys, check this out,
I found something.

1117
00:36:16,907 --> 00:36:18,107
What is it?

1118
00:36:18,108 --> 00:36:19,908
I don't know.

1119
00:36:19,909 --> 00:36:23,485
Looks like a big silver
basketball or something.

1120
00:36:28,485 --> 00:36:30,485
What is it?

1121
00:36:28,485 --> 00:36:30,757
BOB:
It looks like a toy.

1122
00:36:33,757 --> 00:36:35,757
Whoa.

1123
00:36:33,757 --> 00:36:35,859
What the fuck is that?

1124
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:37,225
MAN:
What's going on

1125
00:36:37,226 --> 00:36:38,259
up here?

1126
00:36:38,260 --> 00:36:39,394
We got company.

1127
00:36:39,395 --> 00:36:41,065
What in the hell
are you people doing

1128
00:36:41,066 --> 00:36:42,297
in my yard?!

1129
00:36:42,298 --> 00:36:44,366
Hi, sorry, we're the
Neighborhood Watch.

1130
00:36:44,367 --> 00:36:45,867
We were just out on
a nightly patrol.

1131
00:36:45,868 --> 00:36:47,103
How you doing?
I'm Evan Trautwig.

1132
00:36:47,104 --> 00:36:50,073
I got your neighborhood watch
right here, sweet lips.

1133
00:36:50,074 --> 00:36:51,572
We-We're, we're
on your side, sir.

1134
00:36:51,573 --> 00:36:53,476
We're just wondering if
you heard anything strange

1135
00:36:53,477 --> 00:36:55,511
or just anything out of
the ordinary tonight.

1136
00:36:55,512 --> 00:36:57,613
You mean, like four nitwits
standing around

1137
00:36:57,614 --> 00:36:59,881
on my lawn in the middle
of the night?

1138
00:36:59,882 --> 00:37:01,418
That's kind of strange,
don't you think?

1139
00:37:01,419 --> 00:37:02,418
Okay.

1140
00:37:01,418 --> 00:37:02,650
Hey, you know what, pal?

1141
00:37:02,651 --> 00:37:04,288
If being overly aggressive
and a little bit snippy

1142
00:37:04,289 --> 00:37:07,756
was a crime, I'd be making
a citizen's arrest right now.

1143
00:37:07,757 --> 00:37:09,758
Why don't you just shut your
cocksucker there, dickweed?

1144
00:37:09,759 --> 00:37:11,159
You know, we're taking time
out of our busy schedules

1145
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:13,327
to help the neighborhood,
so I think you could just...

1146
00:37:13,328 --> 00:37:14,329
you know, you don't have to...

1147
00:37:13,329 --> 00:37:14,697
("Sailing" ringtone playing)

1148
00:37:14,698 --> 00:37:17,767
Excuse me,
got a phone call here.

1149
00:37:17,768 --> 00:37:19,335
Hey, Bill.

1150
00:37:19,336 --> 00:37:20,336
Bill.

1151
00:37:19,336 --> 00:37:20,501
I got four members

1152
00:37:20,502 --> 00:37:22,338
of the Baby-sitters Club
up here...

1153
00:37:22,339 --> 00:37:23,340
It's the Neighborhood Watch.

1154
00:37:22,340 --> 00:37:23,872
...trying to solve some kind

1155
00:37:23,873 --> 00:37:26,176
of mystery
before beddy-bye time.

1156
00:37:26,177 --> 00:37:28,177
I'll call you back later.

1157
00:37:26,177 --> 00:37:28,511
All right, okay, we...

1158
00:37:28,512 --> 00:37:30,745
It's okay, sir,
we get it, we're...

1159
00:37:30,746 --> 00:37:31,847
Thank you for...
We'll just...

1160
00:37:31,848 --> 00:37:33,982
You guys,
I'm gonna count to ten.

1161
00:37:33,983 --> 00:37:35,249
Okay, you know what?
Let's start again.

1162
00:37:35,250 --> 00:37:36,383
I'm gonna count to ten!

1163
00:37:36,384 --> 00:37:37,385
He wants to count.

1164
00:37:36,385 --> 00:37:37,787
Okay.

1165
00:37:37,788 --> 00:37:39,788
One...

1166
00:37:37,788 --> 00:37:39,321
Steal that cool ball.

1167
00:37:39,322 --> 00:37:41,524
...two, three...

1168
00:37:41,525 --> 00:37:42,859
Nice to meet you.

1169
00:37:42,860 --> 00:37:44,259
Fuck you, Curly!

1170
00:37:44,260 --> 00:37:45,528
...four.

1171
00:37:45,529 --> 00:37:49,064
Get in your goddamn
soccer mom van and move on out.

1172
00:37:49,065 --> 00:37:50,063
(engine starts)

1173
00:37:50,064 --> 00:37:51,067
Neighborhood Watch.

1174
00:37:51,068 --> 00:37:53,505
What a fucking joke.

1175
00:37:55,505 --> 00:37:57,640
Look at this.

1176
00:37:57,641 --> 00:37:59,610
Every time I stick a finger in,
another light goes on.

1177
00:37:59,611 --> 00:38:01,414
That's weird.

1178
00:38:03,414 --> 00:38:04,545
Hey, why don't we try to stick

1179
00:38:04,546 --> 00:38:05,914
all our fingers in
at the same time,

1180
00:38:05,915 --> 00:38:07,016
see what happens?

1181
00:38:07,017 --> 00:38:08,484
All right, guys,

1182
00:38:08,485 --> 00:38:10,152
let's all finger
these holes together.

1183
00:38:10,153 --> 00:38:11,587
This is a bad idea.

1184
00:38:11,588 --> 00:38:14,089
Oh, don't be such a pussy,
Jamarcus, come on.

1185
00:38:14,090 --> 00:38:15,692
Come over here and finger-
bang this ball with us.

1186
00:38:15,693 --> 00:38:17,625
I don't like this.

1187
00:38:17,626 --> 00:38:19,626
Come on, Jamarcus.

1188
00:38:17,626 --> 00:38:19,095
Okay,

1189
00:38:19,096 --> 00:38:21,564
fine, but this is a bad idea.

1190
00:38:21,565 --> 00:38:22,565
Get your finger in there.

1191
00:38:21,565 --> 00:38:22,472
Okay.

1192
00:38:28,472 --> 00:38:29,906
(cow moos)

1193
00:38:29,907 --> 00:38:30,906
Whoa!

1194
00:38:30,907 --> 00:38:32,040
Jesus!

1195
00:38:32,041 --> 00:38:33,309
Shit! Holy shit!

1196
00:38:33,310 --> 00:38:34,977
Are you kidding me?

1197
00:38:34,978 --> 00:38:37,978
Did you see that shit?

1198
00:38:34,978 --> 00:38:37,046
That cow's fucking head

1199
00:38:37,047 --> 00:38:38,380
exploded all over the place.

1200
00:38:38,381 --> 00:38:39,648
That's terrible for the cow,

1201
00:38:39,649 --> 00:38:41,216
but this thing's
fucking awesome.

1202
00:38:41,217 --> 00:38:42,651
This is a major find.

1203
00:38:42,652 --> 00:38:43,853
This thing is the shit.

1204
00:38:43,854 --> 00:38:45,455
Okay, nobody touches this ball

1205
00:38:45,456 --> 00:38:47,156
till we figure out what it is.

1206
00:38:47,157 --> 00:38:49,125
We definitely should not
fuck around with this thing.

1207
00:38:49,126 --> 00:38:52,528
The last thing we want to
do is cause a disturbance.

Guys, this is not
from this world.

1232
00:39:35,104 --> 00:39:36,771
I, I, I think it could be
the government, you know.

1233
00:39:36,772 --> 00:39:39,043
There are lots of these kind
of prototypes that you find.

1234
00:39:39,044 --> 00:39:40,642
It's always the government.

1235
00:39:40,643 --> 00:39:41,844
I don't disagree
that there could be

1236
00:39:41,845 --> 00:39:43,079
a government or an alien

1237
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:45,113
or where governments
and aliens connect.

00:39:47,317 --> 00:39:48,618
I'm not paranoid.

Everything is on
the table; right now

1242
00:39:50,018 --> 00:39:51,019
we don't take anything off.

1243
00:39:50,019 --> 00:39:51,351
This was probably on the way

1244
00:39:51,352 --> 00:39:52,753
to the fucking Mac Store,
and it fell off the truck.

00:39:58,060 --> 00:39:59,061
Right, a killer alien.

1249
00:39:58,061 --> 00:39:59,662
It's a...

1250
00:39:59,663 --> 00:40:00,762
Somebody killed Antonio.

1251
00:40:00,763 --> 00:40:01,929
Okay, I don't know
if they're an alien,

1252
00:40:01,930 --> 00:40:03,130
I don't know
if it was an octopus.

1253
00:40:03,131 --> 00:40:04,867
I don't know what it was
or who it was,

1254
00:40:04,868 --> 00:40:05,969
but this has something
to do with it, right?

1255
00:40:05,970 --> 00:40:07,969
You. Well, you.

1256
00:40:05,969 --> 00:40:07,068
Yes, that's a yes.

1257
00:40:07,069 --> 00:40:08,438
Let's go to the things
we can agree on.

1258
00:40:08,439 --> 00:40:10,438
We don't know what it is.

1259
00:40:08,438 --> 00:40:10,473
That's correct as well.

1260
00:40:10,474 --> 00:40:12,474
It's the same goo that was
on Antonio's body.

1261
00:40:10,474 --> 00:40:12,942
This is

1262
00:40:12,943 --> 00:40:14,710
information you're sharing,
and I'll say yes to it.

1263
00:40:14,711 --> 00:40:17,379
The goo was on the car,
the orb was near the car.

1264
00:40:17,380 --> 00:40:19,047
Let's call her Lucy.

1265
00:40:19,048 --> 00:40:20,048
The second after
we find Lucy...

1266
00:40:19,048 --> 00:40:20,549
BOB: Lucy.

1267
00:40:20,550 --> 00:40:22,451
...who kicks us
off his property?

1268
00:40:22,452 --> 00:40:24,419
Crazy old guy with a shotgun.

1269
00:40:24,420 --> 00:40:26,955
Why'd he want us
off his property?

1270
00:40:26,956 --> 00:40:28,956
- Why did he not want us near the ball or the goo?
- Right?

1271
00:40:28,957 --> 00:40:30,559
This is the guy, we got
to kick his tires.

1272
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:31,726
There's something we
got to figure out.

1273
00:40:31,727 --> 00:40:33,329
I think we dress
Franklin up as a girl

1274
00:40:33,330 --> 00:40:36,232
named Fran-Francesca, he goes
to the door as a salesman

1275
00:40:36,233 --> 00:40:38,231
because they'll suspect him any
other way. He's pretty enough.

1276
00:40:38,232 --> 00:40:39,233
I'm, I'm listening.

1277
00:40:38,233 --> 00:40:39,968
He's an attractive guy

1278
00:40:39,969 --> 00:40:41,971
and he has the features
where he can fool 'em.

1279
00:40:41,972 --> 00:40:44,972
- Feminine features.
- So we put Franklin in a costume,

1280
00:40:44,975 --> 00:40:46,974
send him for the old man.

1281
00:40:44,974 --> 00:40:46,340
He's lonely, he's lonely.

1282
00:40:46,341 --> 00:40:47,744
He'll let Franklin
in the house.

1283
00:40:47,745 --> 00:40:49,744
Boom, he's in.

1284
00:40:47,744 --> 00:40:49,479
We're inside the house.

1285
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:51,146
Now it's intel,
he's under the radar.

1286
00:40:51,147 --> 00:40:53,115
It's an attractive lady
showing up.

1287
00:40:53,116 --> 00:40:55,984
His liver-spotted hands are
going to want to caress her.

1288
00:40:55,985 --> 00:40:57,587
Can I tell you something, Bob?

1289
00:40:57,588 --> 00:40:58,587
BOB:
Mm-hmm.

1290
00:40:58,588 --> 00:41:00,089
That could work.

1291
00:41:00,090 --> 00:41:01,156
Yes!

1292
00:41:01,157 --> 00:41:02,157
FRANKLIN: Here's the thing.

1293
00:41:01,157 --> 00:41:02,725
Finally!

1294
00:41:02,726 --> 00:41:04,559
I'm not going to go past
second with this old guy,

1295
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:05,860
but if I have to, I will.

1296
00:41:05,861 --> 00:41:06,864
I think it's important we get,

1297
00:41:06,865 --> 00:41:08,362
we get really, really confirmed

1298
00:41:08,363 --> 00:41:10,197
on what you're prepared to
do so it's not a new thing.

1299
00:41:10,198 --> 00:41:11,199
Let's talk about it.

1300
00:41:10,199 --> 00:41:11,700
I will use both hands.

1301
00:41:11,701 --> 00:41:12,867
I won't use a mouth.

1302
00:41:12,868 --> 00:41:14,369
He may use his hands and
may not use his mouth.

1303
00:41:14,370 --> 00:41:15,637
Well, I think you got

1304
00:41:15,638 --> 00:41:16,838
to make it all go down
before you get found out.

1305
00:41:16,839 --> 00:41:17,905
FRANKLIN:
Here's the issue.

1306
00:41:17,906 --> 00:41:19,106
What's the best-
case on this one?

1307
00:41:19,107 --> 00:41:20,340
Okay, here's the
best-case scenario:

1308
00:41:20,341 --> 00:41:21,608
He's a lonely old man,
he wants to waltz,

1309
00:41:21,609 --> 00:41:22,777
he wants to listen to some

1310
00:41:22,778 --> 00:41:24,414
of the old songs
from his childhood.

1311
00:41:24,415 --> 00:41:27,049
Worst-case scenario: you're
getting fucked in the ass.

1312
00:41:27,050 --> 00:41:28,585
Either way we're gonna find
out who this old man is.

1313
00:41:28,586 --> 00:41:31,154
Either way we're gonna get
involved in this guy's life.

1314
00:41:31,155 --> 00:41:33,422
Here's the pressing question:
What do we do with this?

1315
00:41:33,423 --> 00:41:35,422
We don't give it to the cops.

1316
00:41:33,422 --> 00:41:35,058
JAMARCUS: Agreed.

1317
00:41:35,059 --> 00:41:36,758
This is ours;
No one hears about it.

1318
00:41:36,759 --> 00:41:38,325
EVAN:
I don't know, but we keep it

1319
00:41:38,326 --> 00:41:39,429
a Neighborhood Watch secret.

1320
00:41:39,430 --> 00:41:40,429
Cheers.

1321
00:41:39,429 --> 00:41:40,697
Well, we're in the game.

1322
00:41:40,698 --> 00:41:42,265
To the watch.

1323
00:41:42,266 --> 00:41:43,265
Boom.

1324
00:41:43,266 --> 00:41:45,369
(engine stops)

1325
00:41:47,369 --> 00:41:49,978
(sighs)

1326
00:41:55,978 --> 00:41:57,125
Ew.

1327
00:42:08,125 --> 00:42:11,800
(dog barks in distance)

1328
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:18,672
(tapping keys)

1329
00:42:22,672 --> 00:42:25,674
"OMG, Mandy's party
is so awesome."

1330
00:42:25,675 --> 00:42:27,942
Good for Mandy.

1331
00:42:27,943 --> 00:42:29,946
Frickin' kidding me, right?

1332
00:42:29,947 --> 00:42:31,891
(partiers whooping on video)

1333
00:42:40,891 --> 00:42:43,125
Chelsea!

1334
00:42:43,126 --> 00:42:44,493
Dad, what the F?

1335
00:42:44,494 --> 00:42:45,495
Don't F me.

1336
00:42:45,496 --> 00:42:47,430
Who's this boy toy named Jason?

1337
00:42:47,431 --> 00:42:49,431
Boy toy?

1338
00:42:47,431 --> 00:42:49,297
What's his toy story?

1339
00:42:49,298 --> 00:42:52,634
Oh, wait, were you creeping
on my Facebook again?

1340
00:42:52,635 --> 00:42:53,633
Are you kidding me?

1341
00:42:53,634 --> 00:42:55,537
You're gonna let
some guy car-wash

1342
00:42:55,538 --> 00:42:57,240
the inside of your mouth
with his tongue

1343
00:42:57,241 --> 00:42:59,442
and then you're gonna post it
on the Internet?

1344
00:42:59,443 --> 00:43:00,876
Stop Internet stalking me, okay?

1345
00:43:00,877 --> 00:43:02,243
Just get out of my room.

1346
00:43:02,244 --> 00:43:03,679
You don't see me and your mom
posting our sessions

1347
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:04,681
on the Internet, do you?

1348
00:43:03,681 --> 00:43:04,879
Ew, that's

1349
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:06,880
disgusting, Dad.

1350
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:06,415
Well, how do you
think that makes

1351
00:43:06,416 --> 00:43:07,416
me feel? It is disgusting.

1352
00:43:07,417 --> 00:43:08,851
You keep your tongue
in your mouth.

1353
00:43:08,852 --> 00:43:10,986
And what's going on
with this collage?

1354
00:43:10,987 --> 00:43:12,153
This is moving
in the direction of, like,

1355
00:43:12,154 --> 00:43:13,155
strippers on spring break.

1356
00:43:12,155 --> 00:43:13,355
Oh, my God.

1357
00:43:13,356 --> 00:43:14,588
That's a collage
of my friends, Dad.

1358
00:43:14,589 --> 00:43:15,590
This is uncomfortable.

1359
00:43:15,591 --> 00:43:16,891
The whole thing's
uncomfortable.

1360
00:43:16,892 --> 00:43:18,092
I'm not comfortable with
what's going on, Chelsea.

1361
00:43:18,093 --> 00:43:19,829
If you're uncomfortable,
then get out.

1362
00:43:19,830 --> 00:43:23,829
Sex is for love.

1363
00:43:19,829 --> 00:43:23,265
Sex is for love.

1364
00:43:23,266 --> 00:43:25,099
Here's what's happening
now... the video's off.

1365
00:43:25,100 --> 00:43:26,835
Okay, Dad, I'm gonna
get the video off.

1366
00:43:26,836 --> 00:43:28,835
Fine, right, okay.

1367
00:43:26,835 --> 00:43:28,169
Or we got a problem.

1368
00:43:28,170 --> 00:43:29,170
Please get out.

1369
00:43:28,170 --> 00:43:29,604
Houston, we have a problem.

1370
00:43:29,605 --> 00:43:30,606
Okay, Dad, that's good.

1371
00:43:30,607 --> 00:43:32,607
Really productive conversation.

1372
00:43:32,608 --> 00:43:34,608
Seriously, really.

1373
00:43:32,608 --> 00:43:34,246
We should do more of it.

1374
00:43:37,246 --> 00:43:39,749
Right on the edge.

1375
00:43:39,750 --> 00:43:41,489
You're right on the edge.

1376
00:43:45,489 --> 00:43:48,869
# #

1377
00:43:58,869 --> 00:44:02,177
(phone chirps)

1378
00:44:07,177 --> 00:44:11,413
# You and tequila
make me crazy... #

1379
00:44:11,414 --> 00:44:12,414
Hey.

1380
00:44:11,414 --> 00:44:12,948
Hey, buddy.

1381
00:44:12,949 --> 00:44:14,784
BOB: Come on, I saved
a seat for you.

1382
00:44:14,785 --> 00:44:16,785
Said you were desperate.

1383
00:44:16,786 --> 00:44:18,188
Yeah, here, take a load off.

1384
00:44:18,189 --> 00:44:20,790
Look, I know we're trying to
catch the Costco Killer, but,

1385
00:44:20,791 --> 00:44:22,226
well, it's good to have
an honest heart-to-heart

1386
00:44:22,227 --> 00:44:24,926
with just a couple
of guys, right?

1387
00:44:24,927 --> 00:44:25,961
There's my boy.

1388
00:44:25,962 --> 00:44:27,961
(clanking)

1389
00:44:25,961 --> 00:44:27,263
Bring it down here.

1390
00:44:27,264 --> 00:44:29,064
Get in here.

1391
00:44:29,065 --> 00:44:31,265
It's all about honesty, right?

1392
00:44:31,266 --> 00:44:32,334
Mm-hmm.

1393
00:44:32,335 --> 00:44:33,802
I've been being honest
with my daughter.

1394
00:44:33,803 --> 00:44:35,505
I don't think
she wants to hear it.

1395
00:44:35,506 --> 00:44:36,705
(chuckles)

1396
00:44:36,706 --> 00:44:38,641
My wife's been traveling
so much for work that a,

1397
00:44:38,642 --> 00:44:41,877
you know, a lot of the parenting
stuff has fallen on me lately.

1398
00:44:41,878 --> 00:44:43,178
How about you?

1399
00:44:43,179 --> 00:44:46,982
When are you going to take the
plunge and knock a few out?

1400
00:44:46,983 --> 00:44:49,451
Uh, it's not that simple.

1401
00:44:49,452 --> 00:44:53,654
Well, it's about as simple as
putting your dick in a vagina.

1402
00:44:53,655 --> 00:44:55,092
You know what I mean?
Make it happen.

1403
00:44:55,093 --> 00:44:58,097
Well, I don't really
have a choice, so...

1404
00:45:00,097 --> 00:45:04,966
It turns out that my
gun doesn't really

1405
00:45:04,967 --> 00:45:06,868
shoot too well.

1406
00:45:06,869 --> 00:45:08,869
Gun?

1407
00:45:06,869 --> 00:45:08,337
Yeah.

1408
00:45:08,338 --> 00:45:09,436
You mean your prick?

1409
00:45:09,437 --> 00:45:10,572
Why are you saying "gun"?

1410
00:45:10,573 --> 00:45:11,873
This is two guys
sitting on a bench.

1411
00:45:11,874 --> 00:45:13,740
You can say it,
say "prick," say "cock."

1412
00:45:13,741 --> 00:45:15,008
Just say "prick."
Anyway, did you take

1413
00:45:15,009 --> 00:45:16,146
a couple of those blue bombers?

1414
00:45:16,147 --> 00:45:17,146
No.

1415
00:45:16,146 --> 00:45:17,644
Got to get that wang
nice and stiff

1416
00:45:17,645 --> 00:45:18,648
and get you all monstered up.

1417
00:45:18,649 --> 00:45:20,648
N-No, no, no.

1418
00:45:18,648 --> 00:45:20,116
Oh, it will,

1419
00:45:20,117 --> 00:45:21,117
and then you'll be fucking
like a champ in no time.

1420
00:45:20,117 --> 00:45:21,716
No.

1421
00:45:21,717 --> 00:45:23,717
No, I can, I, that's...

1422
00:45:21,717 --> 00:45:23,686
I know a guy
that'll give you some

1423
00:45:23,687 --> 00:45:25,686
and I got some from Mexico...

1424
00:45:23,686 --> 00:45:25,553
That's not the problem.

1425
00:45:25,554 --> 00:45:26,554
That's not the problem.

1426
00:45:25,554 --> 00:45:26,955
I'll get you some

1427
00:45:26,956 --> 00:45:28,956
of those Mexican bombs.

1428
00:45:26,956 --> 00:45:28,823
I can do everything.

1429
00:45:28,824 --> 00:45:31,394
It's just that, uh...

1430
00:45:32,394 --> 00:45:34,997
I'm... about a year
and a half ago...

1431
00:45:34,998 --> 00:45:37,998
Okay.

1432
00:45:34,998 --> 00:45:37,165
Abby and I started trying

1433
00:45:37,166 --> 00:45:38,166
to have kids...

1434
00:45:37,166 --> 00:45:38,334
Mm-hmm.

1435
00:45:38,335 --> 00:45:40,569
...and nothing
was happening, so,

1436
00:45:40,570 --> 00:45:44,205
on my own, I went to see this
doctor, to get my sperm checked.

1437
00:45:44,206 --> 00:45:45,572
You know, I've always
wondered about that.

1438
00:45:45,573 --> 00:45:47,677
I've just had a curiosity
about it if you don't mind.

1439
00:45:47,678 --> 00:45:49,745
When you go to one
of those doctors,

1440
00:45:49,746 --> 00:45:51,245
do you jerk yourself off

1441
00:45:51,246 --> 00:45:52,949
or does the doctor,
like, jerk you off

1442
00:45:52,950 --> 00:45:54,281
or, like, an assistant?

1443
00:45:54,282 --> 00:45:56,316
Is it like a massage parlor or
do they have, like, a machine,

1444
00:45:56,317 --> 00:45:58,086
like, a medical machine
that does the milking for you?

1445
00:45:58,087 --> 00:46:00,925
Like, milks you like an animal?

1446
00:46:01,925 --> 00:46:03,793
I'm asking how you get
the cum out of you.

1447
00:46:03,794 --> 00:46:05,793
I...

1448
00:46:03,793 --> 00:46:05,060
They do it.

1449
00:46:05,061 --> 00:46:08,062
No, I jerked me off.

1450
00:46:08,063 --> 00:46:09,063
Okay.

1451
00:46:08,063 --> 00:46:09,464
Doesn't matter.

1452
00:46:09,465 --> 00:46:13,334
The point is, I went,
I got tested,

1453
00:46:13,335 --> 00:46:17,071
and... no go.

1454
00:46:17,072 --> 00:46:19,808
I'm shooting blanks.

1455
00:46:19,809 --> 00:46:21,776
I, I could shoot a bucketful,

1456
00:46:21,777 --> 00:46:23,146
it would make no difference.

1457
00:46:23,147 --> 00:46:26,982
Doctor's actual words...
"a bucketful."

1458
00:46:26,983 --> 00:46:29,384
It's because of me,
we can't have kids.

1459
00:46:29,385 --> 00:46:31,252
Just me.

1460
00:46:31,253 --> 00:46:33,788
I didn't realize that
that's such a big deal.

1461
00:46:33,789 --> 00:46:34,990
I mean, it's 2012.

1462
00:46:34,991 --> 00:46:37,459
Can't you just get,
like, a ball transplant?

1463
00:46:37,460 --> 00:46:41,363
Yeah, I don't think the
science is there yet.

1464
00:46:41,364 --> 00:46:44,503
What'd the old lady say
when you told her?

1465
00:46:47,503 --> 00:46:48,570
Evaroony, don't tell me

1466
00:46:48,571 --> 00:46:50,239
that you haven't talked
to her about it.

1467
00:46:50,240 --> 00:46:53,975
Well, what am I going to say?

1468
00:46:53,976 --> 00:46:56,310
Hey, honey, guess what?

1469
00:46:56,311 --> 00:46:59,580
The one thing you want
most in the world,

1470
00:46:59,581 --> 00:47:02,049
I can't give you.

1471
00:47:02,050 --> 00:47:05,087
Evan, you listen to me.

1472
00:47:05,088 --> 00:47:07,823
You talk to Abby.

1473
00:47:07,824 --> 00:47:09,725
She married you,

1474
00:47:09,726 --> 00:47:11,862
not your dead jizz.

1475
00:47:12,862 --> 00:47:14,330
Thanks.

1476
00:47:14,331 --> 00:47:16,601
("Shave and a Haircut" ringtone
playing)

1477
00:47:19,601 --> 00:47:21,002
Evan Trautwig.

1478
00:47:21,003 --> 00:47:23,406
(over phone):
Hey, this is Manfred Salisbury.

1479
00:47:23,407 --> 00:47:24,407
Are you on my roof?

1480
00:47:23,407 --> 00:47:24,906
What?

1481
00:47:24,907 --> 00:47:26,709
Well, there's somebody
on my roof

1482
00:47:26,710 --> 00:47:27,874
jumping around like a maniac.

1483
00:47:27,875 --> 00:47:29,045
Is that one of you idiots?

1484
00:47:29,046 --> 00:47:31,279
It most certainly is not.

1485
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:33,549
Uh, please just hang
tight, Mr. Salisbury,

1486
00:47:33,550 --> 00:47:34,548
we'll be right there.

1487
00:47:34,549 --> 00:47:35,652
Yeah, I'll bet you will.

1488
00:47:35,653 --> 00:47:37,486
Got to get to Manfred's.

1489
00:47:37,487 --> 00:47:39,731
Call the Watch; come on.

1490
00:47:48,731 --> 00:47:50,768
Nobody's here.

1491
00:47:51,768 --> 00:47:52,801
Seriously?

1492
00:47:52,802 --> 00:47:53,936
You see anybody on the roof?

1493
00:47:53,937 --> 00:47:55,803
No.

1494
00:47:55,804 --> 00:47:57,839
Okay, we should fan out.
Franklin,

1495
00:47:57,840 --> 00:47:58,905
you and Bob get
in the car, check

1496
00:47:58,906 --> 00:47:59,907
the block, see if
you get any action.

1497
00:47:59,908 --> 00:48:01,478
Jamarcus and I will
go around back.

1498
00:48:01,479 --> 00:48:03,478
Okay.

1499
00:48:01,478 --> 00:48:03,779
Got it.

1500
00:48:03,780 --> 00:48:05,080
Good.

1501
00:48:05,081 --> 00:48:06,449
Hey, guys, let's stay focused.

1502
00:48:06,450 --> 00:48:08,584
We're in the field, right?

1503
00:48:08,585 --> 00:48:09,584
Okay.

1504
00:48:09,585 --> 00:48:11,027
N.W.

1505
00:48:18,027 --> 00:48:20,662
(owl hooting)

1506
00:48:20,663 --> 00:48:21,666
(distant howl echoing)

1507
00:48:23,666 --> 00:48:25,666
- Shh.
- # Sailing... #

1508
00:48:25,669 --> 00:48:26,901
Hear that?

1509
00:48:26,902 --> 00:48:30,738
# Takes me away to where
I've always heard #

1510
00:48:30,739 --> 00:48:33,008
# Sailing #

1511
00:48:33,009 --> 00:48:36,011
# Takes me away
to where I've al... #

1512
00:48:36,012 --> 00:48:37,011
(beeps)

1513
00:48:37,012 --> 00:48:38,913
This is Manfred's.

1514
00:48:38,914 --> 00:48:40,914
This is not good.

1515
00:48:38,914 --> 00:48:40,121
(rustling)

1516
00:48:46,121 --> 00:48:47,989
(whispering):
What is that?

1517
00:48:47,990 --> 00:48:49,827
(whispering):
I don't know.

1518
00:48:51,827 --> 00:48:53,134
(chittering)

1519
00:48:57,134 --> 00:48:59,901
Oh, my God.

1520
00:48:59,902 --> 00:49:00,903
Evan...

1521
00:49:00,904 --> 00:49:03,705
we should run for our lives.

1522
00:49:03,706 --> 00:49:07,241
(chittering)

1523
00:49:07,242 --> 00:49:09,111
We should go up to it.

1524
00:49:09,112 --> 00:49:10,480
Why would we go up to it?

1525
00:49:10,481 --> 00:49:12,013
We should go.

1526
00:49:12,014 --> 00:49:14,116
EVAN:
It looks scared.

1527
00:49:14,117 --> 00:49:15,484
Maybe he's injured.

1528
00:49:15,485 --> 00:49:17,618
Maybe that's what
we hit in the car.

1529
00:49:17,619 --> 00:49:19,788
Yeah, and maybe
he's really pissed off about it

1530
00:49:19,789 --> 00:49:21,355
and is going to eat us.

1531
00:49:21,356 --> 00:49:23,561
Only one way to find out.

1532
00:49:25,561 --> 00:49:27,562
Come on.

1533
00:49:27,563 --> 00:49:29,931
Evan.

1534
00:49:29,932 --> 00:49:33,005
(humming tones)

1535
00:49:36,005 --> 00:49:38,506
Evan, what the fuck
are you doing?

1536
00:49:38,507 --> 00:49:40,776
It obviously doesn't
understand our language.

1537
00:49:40,777 --> 00:49:45,647
I'm making friendly tones to
show it that we mean no harm.

1538
00:49:45,648 --> 00:49:46,749
# Hello... #

1539
00:49:46,750 --> 00:49:50,785
(chittering)

1540
00:49:50,786 --> 00:49:53,321
Wow.

1541
00:49:53,322 --> 00:49:54,723
Oh, no.

1542
00:49:54,724 --> 00:49:57,091
(chittering)

1543
00:49:57,092 --> 00:50:00,895
I see you.

1544
00:50:00,896 --> 00:50:05,567
I... see you.

1545
00:50:05,568 --> 00:50:07,102
Hungry?

1546
00:50:07,103 --> 00:50:09,004
Food?

1547
00:50:09,005 --> 00:50:10,671
Food...?

1548
00:50:10,672 --> 00:50:12,774
Gum?

1549
00:50:12,775 --> 00:50:14,776
It's okay.

1550
00:50:14,777 --> 00:50:16,681
You just chew it.

1551
00:50:18,681 --> 00:50:20,316
You want some?

1552
00:50:20,317 --> 00:50:22,517
("Close Encounters" tones):
# Gum, gum #

1553
00:50:22,518 --> 00:50:23,919
# Gum #

1554
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:26,525
# For you. #

1555
00:50:28,525 --> 00:50:31,664
(chittering)

1556
00:50:34,664 --> 00:50:35,997
He likes it.

1557
00:50:35,998 --> 00:50:37,197
Jamarcus, he likes it.

1558
00:50:37,198 --> 00:50:38,201
Everyone likes gum.

1559
00:50:38,202 --> 00:50:39,234
Let's go.

1560
00:50:39,235 --> 00:50:40,503
He's digging something.

1561
00:50:40,504 --> 00:50:43,171
He's got something
he wants to show us.

1562
00:50:43,172 --> 00:50:45,909
Want to share your gift, huh?

1563
00:50:47,909 --> 00:50:49,081
Oh, mother of fuck!

1564
00:50:52,081 --> 00:50:54,448
(chittering)

1565
00:50:54,449 --> 00:50:55,451
(roars)

1566
00:50:55,452 --> 00:50:57,151
(screams)

1567
00:50:57,152 --> 00:50:58,889
(grunting)

1568
00:50:59,889 --> 00:51:01,525
(roars)

1569
00:51:02,525 --> 00:51:04,725
Jamarcus, what are you doing?

1570
00:51:04,726 --> 00:51:07,328
Run, man.

1571
00:51:07,329 --> 00:51:09,268
Run!

1572
00:51:13,268 --> 00:51:15,472
(snarling)

1573
00:51:17,472 --> 00:51:19,472
Fucker!

1574
00:51:17,472 --> 00:51:19,077
(alien screeches)

1575
00:51:21,077 --> 00:51:23,846
Oh, shit.

1576
00:51:23,847 --> 00:51:25,846
Jesus.

1577
00:51:25,847 --> 00:51:27,383
You okay?

1578
00:51:27,384 --> 00:51:31,218
Uh, that was really stressful.

1579
00:51:31,219 --> 00:51:33,523
I think I killed it.

1580
00:51:34,523 --> 00:51:35,789
<i>BOB:
What's going on here?</i>

1581
00:51:35,790 --> 00:51:36,590
<i>EVAN:
Gentlemen,</i>

1582
00:51:36,591 --> 00:51:37,994
we formed the Neighborhood Watch

1583
00:51:37,995 --> 00:51:39,895
with a very specific task:

1584
00:51:39,896 --> 00:51:43,230
To find the murderer of
my friend Antonio Guzman.

1585
00:51:43,231 --> 00:51:46,603
Well, tonight, I say to you...

1586
00:51:48,603 --> 00:51:50,138
Holy shit!

1587
00:51:50,139 --> 00:51:51,605
Jesus Christ!

1588
00:51:51,606 --> 00:51:53,075
What the fuck is that?!

1589
00:51:53,076 --> 00:51:54,810
It's an alien.

1590
00:51:54,811 --> 00:51:56,612
It killed Manfred, then
it tried to kill Jamarcus,

1591
00:51:56,613 --> 00:51:57,779
and I came up

1592
00:51:57,780 --> 00:51:59,412
and I nailed it
with a garden gnome

1593
00:51:59,413 --> 00:52:01,081
and it cracked its neck
and it's dead.

1594
00:52:01,082 --> 00:52:02,418
BOB:
This is fucking insane.

1595
00:52:02,419 --> 00:52:04,252
I know, I know.

1596
00:52:04,253 --> 00:52:05,952
We tried to find a killer,
but guess what...

1597
00:52:05,953 --> 00:52:07,322
we found a frickin' alien.

1598
00:52:07,323 --> 00:52:10,292
Ooh, it touches it
and it feels it... ugh!

1599
00:52:10,293 --> 00:52:11,792
This intelligent,

1600
00:52:11,793 --> 00:52:14,629
sentient being

1601
00:52:14,630 --> 00:52:16,598
traveled untold light-years

1602
00:52:16,599 --> 00:52:19,868
to come and visit our planet.

1603
00:52:19,869 --> 00:52:21,572
And you killed him.

1604
00:52:23,572 --> 00:52:24,707
Nice!

1605
00:52:24,708 --> 00:52:26,174
Evan, yeah!

1606
00:52:26,175 --> 00:52:27,910
Hah! He killed it.

1607
00:52:27,911 --> 00:52:29,911
Holy shit.

1608
00:52:27,911 --> 00:52:29,710
Man, screw
the police department.

1609
00:52:29,711 --> 00:52:32,480
I'm gonna get
into the CIA for this.

1610
00:52:32,481 --> 00:52:34,447
I think we should slow down,
we should keep this quiet.

1611
00:52:34,448 --> 00:52:36,217
Or a hundred miles an hour
and really loud,

1612
00:52:36,218 --> 00:52:37,418
because you're looking
at an alien.

1613
00:52:37,419 --> 00:52:38,621
I'm thinking
about T-shirts,

1614
00:52:38,622 --> 00:52:40,455
merchandising, movie deals...

1615
00:52:40,456 --> 00:52:41,588
my mind's going crazy

1616
00:52:41,589 --> 00:52:43,191
with this thing here.
All right, who wants

1617
00:52:43,192 --> 00:52:44,492
a snapper with the alien?

1618
00:52:44,493 --> 00:52:46,226
What am I thinking?
Right, let's go, bitches.

1619
00:52:46,227 --> 00:52:47,595
I don't want to put
pressure on you,

1620
00:52:47,596 --> 00:52:48,898
but it's the first
historical picture

1621
00:52:48,899 --> 00:52:51,433
of anyone with an alien,
so whatever that means to you.

1622
00:52:51,434 --> 00:52:53,034
Here we go, ready,
and we're bringing it.

1623
00:52:53,035 --> 00:52:55,472
Here, let me share in the
sunshine... somebody get in here.

1624
00:52:55,473 --> 00:52:59,040
# Does she walk, does she talk,
does she come complete? #

1625
00:52:59,041 --> 00:53:03,178
# The memory of my angel
could never cause me pain #

1626
00:53:03,179 --> 00:53:07,616
# My blood runs cold,
my memory has just been sold #

1627
00:53:07,617 --> 00:53:12,120
# My angel is the centerfold,
angel is the centerfold #

1628
00:53:12,121 --> 00:53:16,325
# Na, na, na-na, na, na, na-na,
na, na, na, na-na, na, na #

1629
00:53:16,326 --> 00:53:17,527
Get close to it.

1630
00:53:17,528 --> 00:53:20,328
# Na, na-na, na, na, na, na-na,
na, na-na... #

1631
00:53:20,329 --> 00:53:21,931
Yeah, put your dick
on its shoulder.

1632
00:53:21,932 --> 00:53:23,131
# #

1633
00:53:23,132 --> 00:53:24,499
Boom.

1634
00:53:24,500 --> 00:53:27,134
# Na, na, na-na, na, na,
na-na, na, na-na, na-na... #

1635
00:53:27,135 --> 00:53:29,870
# Make it last forever #

1636
00:53:29,871 --> 00:53:32,774
# Ever... #

1637
00:53:32,775 --> 00:53:36,845
# Don't let our love end... #

1638
00:53:36,846 --> 00:53:39,346
(laughter)

1639
00:53:39,347 --> 00:53:40,915
# Make it last forever #

1640
00:53:40,916 --> 00:53:43,916
# No, no, no, no, no #

1641
00:53:40,916 --> 00:53:43,221
# And ever. #

1642
00:53:45,221 --> 00:53:46,858
(alien growls, Bob screams)

1643
00:53:48,858 --> 00:53:50,357
(roars)

1644
00:53:50,358 --> 00:53:52,867
(both scream)

1645
00:53:57,867 --> 00:53:59,773
Evan, help!

1646
00:54:03,773 --> 00:54:06,040
(chittering)

1647
00:54:06,041 --> 00:54:07,010
Uh, uh...

1648
00:54:08,010 --> 00:54:09,910
Oh, my God.

1649
00:54:09,911 --> 00:54:11,412
Bob, the pool balls
aren't hurting him.

1650
00:54:11,413 --> 00:54:12,715
Franklin, you've got to hit him.

1651
00:54:12,716 --> 00:54:14,715
Fuck.

1652
00:54:12,715 --> 00:54:14,383
JAMARCUS: This is bad aim.

1653
00:54:14,384 --> 00:54:15,884
FRANKLIN:
Please don't kill me!

1654
00:54:15,885 --> 00:54:18,885
Hey, hey, al-alien.

1655
00:54:15,885 --> 00:54:18,252
What the fuck are
you doing, Jamarcus?

1656
00:54:18,253 --> 00:54:19,519
He's not a bumblebee!

1657
00:54:19,520 --> 00:54:20,590
Evan, help!
He's gonna kill me

1658
00:54:20,591 --> 00:54:22,223
and I don't know what to do.

1659
00:54:22,224 --> 00:54:23,130
(screaming)

1660
00:54:28,130 --> 00:54:29,534
Oh, shit!

1661
00:54:31,534 --> 00:54:34,035
Oh, shit! Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

1662
00:54:34,036 --> 00:54:36,404
He's gonna eat my face!

1663
00:54:36,405 --> 00:54:38,874
(yelling)

1664
00:54:38,875 --> 00:54:41,576
He's getting goo in my mouth!

1665
00:54:41,577 --> 00:54:43,577
Pull him up.

1666
00:54:41,577 --> 00:54:43,412
FRANKLIN: Oh, my God!

1667
00:54:43,413 --> 00:54:44,913
(Bob grunts, alien screeches)

1668
00:54:47,148 --> 00:54:48,716
Franklin, Jamarcus.

1669
00:54:48,717 --> 00:54:50,556
(yelling)

1670
00:54:53,556 --> 00:54:55,924
I can taste the fucking goo!

1671
00:54:55,925 --> 00:54:58,925
Bring him down.

1672
00:54:55,925 --> 00:54:58,228
That's right.
Give up, go to sleep.

1673
00:54:59,228 --> 00:55:02,464
Shh, shh, relax,
you go to sleep.

1674
00:55:02,465 --> 00:55:06,301
(deep, growly):
We are already among you.

1675
00:55:06,302 --> 00:55:07,313
(all scream)

1676
00:55:17,313 --> 00:55:19,379
What the fuck was that?!

1677
00:55:19,380 --> 00:55:20,380
(groans)

1678
00:55:19,380 --> 00:55:20,749
You can forget about

1679
00:55:20,750 --> 00:55:22,215
the damn merchandising play.

1680
00:55:22,216 --> 00:55:23,217
Is everyone all right?

1681
00:55:22,217 --> 00:55:23,752
(spits)

1682
00:55:23,753 --> 00:55:25,819
Fucking alien came on my face.

1683
00:55:25,820 --> 00:55:26,821
(groans)

1684
00:55:26,822 --> 00:55:27,788
Ow.

1685
00:55:27,789 --> 00:55:29,291
FRANKLIN:
Did you hear that thing?

1686
00:55:29,292 --> 00:55:31,359
(groans)

1687
00:55:31,360 --> 00:55:32,993
"We are among you"?

1688
00:55:32,994 --> 00:55:35,994
What does that mean?

1689
00:55:32,994 --> 00:55:35,096
Means there's more

1690
00:55:35,097 --> 00:55:37,064
of those damn things out there.

1691
00:55:37,065 --> 00:55:39,567
Oh, my God.

1692
00:55:39,568 --> 00:55:41,105
That's why they take the skins.

1693
00:55:43,105 --> 00:55:44,638
To wear them.

1694
00:55:44,639 --> 00:55:47,109
They're among us.

1695
00:55:47,110 --> 00:55:48,743
Oh, fucking great.

1696
00:55:48,744 --> 00:55:50,845
And that damn thing's
been to my house.

1697
00:55:50,846 --> 00:55:52,846
He knows where I live.

1698
00:55:50,846 --> 00:55:52,580
I think if that thing

1699
00:55:52,581 --> 00:55:53,849
had wanted us dead,
we'd be dead, Bob.

1700
00:55:53,850 --> 00:55:56,884
So we don't know who is
and who isn't an alien.

1701
00:55:56,885 --> 00:55:58,986
Bressman's one of them,
I guarantee it.

1702
00:55:58,987 --> 00:56:01,122
1,000 percent.

1703
00:56:01,123 --> 00:56:02,190
Yeah, we should keep this quiet

1704
00:56:02,191 --> 00:56:03,393
until we find out
who we can trust.

1705
00:56:03,394 --> 00:56:06,395
And right now,
we can't trust anybody.

1706
00:56:06,396 --> 00:56:09,163
# People are strange #

1707
00:56:09,164 --> 00:56:11,165
# When you're a stranger #

1708
00:56:11,166 --> 00:56:12,667
# Faces look ugly #

1709
00:56:12,668 --> 00:56:14,201
(screams) # When you're alone #

1710
00:56:14,202 --> 00:56:16,202
What are you doing?!

1711
00:56:14,202 --> 00:56:16,071
# Women seem wicked #

1712
00:56:16,072 --> 00:56:19,072
Back off.

1713
00:56:16,072 --> 00:56:19,040
# When you're unwanted #

1714
00:56:19,041 --> 00:56:20,709
# Streets are uneven #

1715
00:56:20,710 --> 00:56:22,710
Aah!

1716
00:56:20,710 --> 00:56:22,209
# When you're down #

1717
00:56:22,210 --> 00:56:24,645
# When you're strange #

1718
00:56:24,646 --> 00:56:28,082
# Faces come out of the rain #

1719
00:56:28,083 --> 00:56:29,083
# When you're strange #

1720
00:56:28,083 --> 00:56:29,750
(siren whoops)

1721
00:56:29,751 --> 00:56:33,955
# No one remembers your name #

1722
00:56:33,956 --> 00:56:37,258
# When you're strange,
when you're strange #

1723
00:56:37,259 --> 00:56:42,163
# When you're strange #

1724
00:56:42,164 --> 00:56:43,698
# People are strange #

1725
00:56:43,699 --> 00:56:45,533
# When you're a stranger #

1726
00:56:45,534 --> 00:56:47,301
# Faces look ugly #

1727
00:56:47,302 --> 00:56:49,302
- # When you're alone #

1728
00:56:49,305 --> 00:56:53,640
# Women seem wicked

1729
00:56:53,641 --> 00:56:57,312

# When you're strange. #

1734
00:57:09,657 --> 00:57:12,728
You guys been sleeping?

1735
00:57:13,728 --> 00:57:15,263
I haven't slept at all.

1736
00:57:15,264 --> 00:57:16,632
I'm not dealing with this well.

1737
00:57:16,633 --> 00:57:19,237
Any one of these people
could be an alien.

1738
00:57:22,237 --> 00:57:23,340
Check her out.

1739
00:57:24,340 --> 00:57:25,640
It's like she's studying

1740
00:57:25,641 --> 00:57:27,475
some new discovery
or something.

1741
00:57:27,476 --> 00:57:30,278
Some strange object,
some weird,

1742
00:57:30,279 --> 00:57:33,781
bizarre human... circle fruit.

1743
00:57:33,782 --> 00:57:36,618
Looks like she's thinking,
can I ingest this?

1744
00:57:36,619 --> 00:57:37,753
Should I put it

1745
00:57:37,754 --> 00:57:39,654
in my flavor snout?

1746
00:57:39,655 --> 00:57:41,922
Look at this piece of shit
over here.

1747
00:57:41,923 --> 00:57:44,091
BOB: That alien
hasn't learned

1748
00:57:44,092 --> 00:57:45,759
how to eat properly yet.

1749
00:57:45,760 --> 00:57:48,298
So primitive, so clumsy.

1750
00:57:50,298 --> 00:57:51,771
So dangerous.

1751
00:57:54,771 --> 00:57:57,238
There's that
motherfucking Jason kid.

1752
00:57:57,239 --> 00:58:00,644
That's the kid that's all
over Chelsea's Facebook page.

1753
00:58:02,644 --> 00:58:03,846
Magnums?! There's no way

1754
00:58:03,847 --> 00:58:05,846
your dick's that big!

1755
00:58:03,846 --> 00:58:05,279
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

1756
00:58:05,280 --> 00:58:07,582
Bob.

1757
00:58:07,583 --> 00:58:08,583
It's a family store.

1758
00:58:07,583 --> 00:58:08,782
I'm just saying,

1759
00:58:08,783 --> 00:58:10,018
there's no way
his dick's that big

1760
00:58:10,019 --> 00:58:11,919
he needs to buy that shit.

1761
00:58:11,920 --> 00:58:13,155
Some people's are that big.

1762
00:58:13,156 --> 00:58:15,189
Otherwise, they wouldn't
sell condoms like that.

1763
00:58:15,190 --> 00:58:16,389
He's right,
they're a big seller.

1764
00:58:16,390 --> 00:58:18,159
I swear to God,
I'm gonna rip his dick off.

1765
00:58:18,160 --> 00:58:20,026
You're gonna need
two hands, Bobby.

1766
00:58:20,027 --> 00:58:21,028
Hello there, neighbor.

1767
00:58:20,028 --> 00:58:21,863
(screams)

1768
00:58:21,864 --> 00:58:23,864
Jesus.

1769
00:58:21,864 --> 00:58:23,732
(Paul laughs)

1770
00:58:23,733 --> 00:58:24,732
I'm so sorry.

1771
00:58:24,733 --> 00:58:26,733
Did I startle you?

1772
00:58:24,733 --> 00:58:26,201
Uh...

1773
00:58:26,202 --> 00:58:28,103
It's good for you,
you know, though.

1774
00:58:28,103 --> 00:58:28,103
Gets the heart racing.

1775
00:58:28,971 --> 00:58:30,939
And I know you like
to stay fit.

1776
00:58:30,940 --> 00:58:35,477
In any case, I just moseyed
on over here to invite you to

1777
00:58:35,478 --> 00:58:36,711
a little bit of a gathering

1778
00:58:36,712 --> 00:58:39,180
I'm having at my... home.

1779
00:58:39,181 --> 00:58:44,218
A lot of interesting characters
will be in attendance.

1780
00:58:44,219 --> 00:58:46,559
(voice fades):
And, um...

1781
00:58:49,559 --> 00:58:53,160
Um... well, I'll
think about it.

1782
00:58:53,161 --> 00:58:54,831
Oh, well, don't think
about it too long,

1783
00:58:54,832 --> 00:58:56,997
because before you know it...

1784
00:58:56,998 --> 00:58:58,433
(pops lips)

1785
00:58:58,434 --> 00:58:59,933
...life's over.

1786
00:58:59,934 --> 00:59:02,710
Isn't that the truth?

1787
00:59:08,710 --> 00:59:12,379
(whispers):
Holy shit.

1788
00:59:12,380 --> 00:59:13,848
He's one of them.

1789
00:59:13,849 --> 00:59:16,783
I can't believe I didn't
figure it out earlier.

1790
00:59:16,784 --> 00:59:19,221
He's so creepy,
he's been spying on me.

1791
00:59:19,222 --> 00:59:21,455
He said I had nice skin
the other night.

1792
00:59:21,456 --> 00:59:22,624
Get it?

1793
00:59:22,625 --> 00:59:23,825
Skin.

1794
00:59:23,826 --> 00:59:24,891
Yeah, you have incredible skin.

1795
00:59:24,892 --> 00:59:25,994
You don't have to
brag about it.

1796
00:59:25,995 --> 00:59:28,230
No, the aliens
rip off the skin.

1797
00:59:28,231 --> 00:59:29,965
Did you see all the batteries
that guy bought?

1798
00:59:29,966 --> 00:59:31,633
Nobody needs that
many batteries.

1799
00:59:31,634 --> 00:59:34,368
I mean, nobody from
Earth, that is.

1800
00:59:34,369 --> 00:59:37,038
He said, "Before we know it...

1801
00:59:37,039 --> 00:59:38,872
life ends."

1802
00:59:38,873 --> 00:59:40,809
Maybe he thinks
you're getting kind of close

1803
00:59:40,810 --> 00:59:42,609
and he wants to take you out.

1804
00:59:42,610 --> 00:59:44,012
This is what it's about,
tonight.

1805
00:59:44,013 --> 00:59:46,451
This is why we formed
the Neighborhood Watch.

1806
00:59:48,451 --> 00:59:50,285
Just got to grab my jacket.

1807
00:59:50,286 --> 00:59:52,319
ABBY (moans):
Oh, thank goodness.

1808
00:59:52,320 --> 00:59:54,421
It's the leader of the
Neighborhood Watch.

1809
00:59:54,422 --> 00:59:56,491
Abby, what the fuck?

1810
00:59:56,492 --> 00:59:59,195
I'm forming a little club, too,
and it's only got one opening,

1811
01:00:00,996 --> 01:00:02,996
do you have any water?

1812
01:00:00,996 --> 01:00:02,763
(gasps) Oh, my God!

1813
01:00:02,764 --> 01:00:03,762
No, no, no, no!

1814
01:00:03,763 --> 01:00:04,764
Go out, go out.

1815
01:00:03,764 --> 01:00:04,866
Whoa!

1816
01:00:04,867 --> 01:00:06,867
Get out, get out.

1817
01:00:04,867 --> 01:00:06,634
Is that Mrs. Evan?

1818
01:00:06,635 --> 01:00:07,635
- Just leave.
- That's your jacket.

1819
01:00:07,636 --> 01:00:08,635
That's your wife?

1820
01:00:07,635 --> 01:00:08,803
Stop.

1821
01:00:08,804 --> 01:00:09,802
It's nice to meet you,
Mrs. Trautwig.

1822
01:00:09,803 --> 01:00:10,804
- Well done, though.
- Get out!

1823
01:00:10,805 --> 01:00:12,271
I'm Franklin.
I work with...

1824
01:00:12,272 --> 01:00:13,273
I'm a dear friend of Evan's.

1825
01:00:12,273 --> 01:00:13,774
EVAN: She doesn't care.

1826
01:00:13,775 --> 01:00:15,576
Honey... what is... what?

1827
01:00:15,577 --> 01:00:17,880
You're starting a club,
you want me to fill your hole?

1828
01:00:17,881 --> 01:00:19,880
What-what's going on?

1829
01:00:17,880 --> 01:00:19,680
Are you making fun of me?

1830
01:00:19,681 --> 01:00:20,813
Honey, I'm not
making fun of you.

1831
01:00:20,814 --> 01:00:22,050
You look awesome.

1832
01:00:22,051 --> 01:00:25,018
It's just, the timing
kind of is weird and...

1833
01:00:25,019 --> 01:00:27,422
No, what's weird is that
I have to make an appointment

1834
01:00:27,423 --> 01:00:29,422
to have sex with my husband.

1835
01:00:27,422 --> 01:00:29,658
No, you don't.

1836
01:00:29,659 --> 01:00:32,560
And then he forgets and brings
a bunch of weird dudes over.

1837
01:00:32,561 --> 01:00:34,362
I mean, that little one
saw everything.

1838
01:00:34,363 --> 01:00:36,362
Evan, come on!

1839
01:00:34,362 --> 01:00:36,531
Oh, honey, I'm sorry.

1840
01:00:36,532 --> 01:00:38,299
I forgot. I'm sorry.

1841
01:00:38,300 --> 01:00:40,368
Yeah. You forgot.

1842
01:00:40,369 --> 01:00:42,538
BOB (in distance): Give her
some truth, pal. She needs it.

1843
01:00:42,539 --> 01:00:43,937
What? What is that?

1844
01:00:43,938 --> 01:00:45,938
Be that truth-teller, brother!

1845
01:00:43,938 --> 01:00:45,806
He's... I don't know.

1846
01:00:45,807 --> 01:00:46,909
I have no idea.

1847
01:00:46,910 --> 01:00:49,509
You know, I don't even care.

1848
01:00:49,510 --> 01:00:50,511
Just here.

1849
01:00:50,512 --> 01:00:51,746
Go play with your friends.

1850
01:00:51,747 --> 01:00:53,079
Take your stupid jacket and go.

1851
01:00:53,080 --> 01:00:54,313
Honey, please believe me.

1852
01:00:54,314 --> 01:00:55,349
There are forces greater

1853
01:00:55,350 --> 01:00:56,883
than what we're
talking about here

1854
01:00:56,884 --> 01:00:59,088
that I can't explain to you,
that I promise I will explain

1855
01:00:59,089 --> 01:01:01,689
to you at a certain point,
but it just can't be right now.

1856
01:01:01,690 --> 01:01:03,690
Go!

1857
01:01:01,690 --> 01:01:03,524
I'm sorry.

1858
01:01:03,525 --> 01:01:05,563
Honey, if I...

1859
01:01:08,563 --> 01:01:10,644
Come on.

1860
01:01:22,644 --> 01:01:24,380
(pops can open)

1861
01:01:25,380 --> 01:01:26,751
(slurps)

1862
01:01:29,751 --> 01:01:31,484
Hey.

1863
01:01:31,485 --> 01:01:32,854
It's beer.

1864
01:01:32,855 --> 01:01:34,488
(whispering):
You serious?

1865
01:01:34,489 --> 01:01:35,489
Do you want some?

1866
01:01:34,489 --> 01:01:35,589
Shh.

1867
01:01:35,590 --> 01:01:37,427
Here we go. Someone's coming.

1868
01:01:39,427 --> 01:01:41,196
(doorbell rings)

1869
01:01:41,197 --> 01:01:42,564
Do you see that?

1870
01:01:42,565 --> 01:01:43,729
We don't know what that is,

1871
01:01:43,730 --> 01:01:44,867
but that's a couple.

1872
01:01:44,868 --> 01:01:46,974
(door opens)

1873
01:01:51,974 --> 01:01:54,008
(door closes)

1874
01:01:54,009 --> 01:01:57,412
Guys, I definitely smell
alien all over this thing.

1875
01:01:57,413 --> 01:01:59,413
(cell phone ringtone playing)

1876
01:01:57,413 --> 01:01:59,247
(whispering): Bob! Vibrate!

1877
01:01:59,248 --> 01:02:01,348
Give me one second.
Hang on.

1878
01:02:01,349 --> 01:02:03,151
One second. Hello.

1879
01:02:03,152 --> 01:02:04,152
What?

1880
01:02:03,152 --> 01:02:04,685
EVAN: What are you doing?

1881
01:02:04,686 --> 01:02:06,121
Uh, are her parents
gonna be there?

1882
01:02:06,122 --> 01:02:07,121
Shh.

1883
01:02:06,121 --> 01:02:07,488
Absolutely not!

1884
01:02:07,489 --> 01:02:08,489
What the hell are you
talking about?

1885
01:02:07,489 --> 01:02:08,656
EVAN: Shh!

1886
01:02:08,657 --> 01:02:10,657
Chel... no!

1887
01:02:08,657 --> 01:02:10,058
EVAN: Shh. Hey.

1888
01:02:10,059 --> 01:02:12,027
Damn it, guys. I'm sorry,
we got to get out of here.

1889
01:02:12,028 --> 01:02:13,027
Come on, go.

1890
01:02:12,027 --> 01:02:13,495
What are you doing?

1891
01:02:13,496 --> 01:02:15,496
We got to move out quick.
Let's go.

1892
01:02:13,496 --> 01:02:15,163
What are you doing?

1893
01:02:15,164 --> 01:02:17,631
You're gonna give
away our position.

1894
01:02:17,632 --> 01:02:18,731
Okay, listen to me.

1895
01:02:18,732 --> 01:02:19,999
I got to fill you in quick.

1896
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:22,434
Chelsea is on her way
to Mandy's house for a party.

1897
01:02:22,435 --> 01:02:23,503
Her parents are not there.

1898
01:02:23,504 --> 01:02:24,838
Now, what I can gather so far

1899
01:02:24,839 --> 01:02:26,474
from Mandy's Facebook page
is she's a total whore.

1900
01:02:26,475 --> 01:02:28,075
This is gonna be
a full-blown fuck festival.

1901
01:02:28,076 --> 01:02:29,075
There's gonna be
touching and pulling,

1902
01:02:29,076 --> 01:02:30,077
there's gonna be climaxing.

1903
01:02:30,078 --> 01:02:31,144
Chelsea's gonna
be there any minute.

1904
01:02:31,145 --> 01:02:32,144
I cannot allow that to happen.

1905
01:02:32,145 --> 01:02:33,280
I need you guys
to come with me.

1906
01:02:33,281 --> 01:02:34,914
We need to put a stop to this.
Let's go.

1907
01:02:34,915 --> 01:02:36,284
Bob, what are you
talking about?

1908
01:02:36,285 --> 01:02:39,953
We are literally on the possible
doorstep of an alien hive.

1909
01:02:39,954 --> 01:02:40,954
You're right.
You know what,

1910
01:02:40,955 --> 01:02:42,488
we got to split up
for a little bit.

1911
01:02:42,489 --> 01:02:43,789
Jamarky-Mark,
you stay with the Evanator.

1912
01:02:43,790 --> 01:02:45,191
That's right. And you,
Frankfurter, you come with me.

1913
01:02:45,192 --> 01:02:46,626
Me and my guy
work well together.

1914
01:02:46,627 --> 01:02:48,130
I'm so fucking far ahead of you
it's not even funny.

1915
01:02:48,131 --> 01:02:49,130
- No, no, no!
- Let's go!

1916
01:02:49,131 --> 01:02:50,329
Franklin, Franklin!

1917
01:02:50,330 --> 01:02:51,331
- Franklin, Franklin, Franklin.
- Let's go.

1918
01:02:51,332 --> 01:02:52,532
You're not going anywhere.

1919
01:02:52,533 --> 01:02:53,532
Bob, your daughter

1920
01:02:53,533 --> 01:02:54,668
is not official business.

1921
01:02:54,669 --> 01:02:56,438
Now, our mandate is
to pursue murderers

1922
01:02:56,439 --> 01:02:59,306
and thieves and aliens
and anyone who threatens

1923
01:02:59,307 --> 01:03:01,609
to tear the fabric
of this neighborhood apart.

1924
01:03:01,610 --> 01:03:04,212
Well, my mandate as a father
is to pursue little pricks

1925
01:03:04,213 --> 01:03:06,714
that try to tear the fabric
of my daughter's hymen apart!

1926
01:03:06,715 --> 01:03:07,816
Shh!

1927
01:03:07,817 --> 01:03:09,417
Don't you walk away.

1928
01:03:09,418 --> 01:03:10,884
Don't you dare.

1929
01:03:10,885 --> 01:03:13,154
Oh, I dare.

1930
01:03:13,155 --> 01:03:15,589
Caw-caw!

1931
01:03:15,590 --> 01:03:17,091
This sucks! This sucks!

1932
01:03:17,092 --> 01:03:18,092
Caw-caw!

1933
01:03:17,092 --> 01:03:18,859
Shut up!

1934
01:03:18,860 --> 01:03:19,861
I'm a bird!

1935
01:03:19,862 --> 01:03:21,662
They can't hear me, idiot!

1936
01:03:21,663 --> 01:03:22,763
We're good.

1937
01:03:22,764 --> 01:03:24,732
Let's go.

1938
01:03:24,733 --> 01:03:26,066
You...!

1939
01:03:26,067 --> 01:03:29,943
(man screaming inside)

1940
01:03:34,943 --> 01:03:36,778
(screaming continues)

1941
01:03:36,779 --> 01:03:39,480
Sounds like somebody's getting
ripped apart in there.

1942
01:03:39,481 --> 01:03:42,350
Smells funky and musty.

1943
01:03:42,351 --> 01:03:44,351
Do you see anything...

1944
01:03:42,351 --> 01:03:44,289
(Evan and Jamarcus scream)

1945
01:03:46,289 --> 01:03:47,488
You okay?

1946
01:03:47,489 --> 01:03:48,355
Aye.

1947
01:03:48,356 --> 01:03:50,356
Are you okay?

1948
01:03:48,356 --> 01:03:50,491
I'm okay.

1949
01:03:50,492 --> 01:03:51,493
Hi, Paul.

1950
01:03:51,494 --> 01:03:53,627
Hi, Evan.

1951
01:03:53,628 --> 01:03:54,628
Whew.

1952
01:03:53,628 --> 01:03:54,995
You all right?

1953
01:03:54,996 --> 01:03:56,730
Scared us.
(chuckles)

1954
01:03:56,731 --> 01:03:58,666
And who is this
mountain of a man?

1955
01:03:58,667 --> 01:04:01,669
My name's Jamarcus.

1956
01:04:01,670 --> 01:04:02,904
He's Jamarcus.

1957
01:04:02,905 --> 01:04:05,043
Shall we?

1958
01:04:08,043 --> 01:04:09,444
(dance music playing)

1959
01:04:09,445 --> 01:04:12,312
# Showtime like cable,
get up on that table #

1960
01:04:12,313 --> 01:04:15,415
# I love your sexy body
and I know you love this paper #

1961
01:04:15,416 --> 01:04:17,451
# Bottles coming
like they got legs on them #

1962
01:04:17,452 --> 01:04:18,953
# The way I kill 'em, man #

1963
01:04:18,954 --> 01:04:21,322
# This beat will make 'em
wanna call the feds on me #

1964
01:04:21,323 --> 01:04:24,424
# Good-good night,
good-good night-night-night #

1965
01:04:24,425 --> 01:04:26,627
# Good-good night,
good-good night #

1966
01:04:26,628 --> 01:04:28,162
Thanks for taking me here.

1967
01:04:28,163 --> 01:04:31,431
This is erotic as hell.

1968
01:04:31,432 --> 01:04:34,567
Big Bob, you got daughter
at midnight, 12:00.

1969
01:04:34,568 --> 01:04:35,702
Move to extraction?

1970
01:04:35,703 --> 01:04:36,903
BOB:
Stand down, Seal Six.

1971
01:04:36,904 --> 01:04:38,271
We go in there hot,
we'll humiliate her

1972
01:04:38,272 --> 01:04:39,840
for the rest of her
high school days.

1973
01:04:39,841 --> 01:04:40,842
Let's just lay low.

1974
01:04:40,843 --> 01:04:43,310
Just taking in intel.

1975
01:04:43,311 --> 01:04:45,313
Look, there's that kid from
Costco with the big fat dick.

1976
01:04:45,314 --> 01:04:48,415
Walking around with his massive
cock like he owns the joint.

1977
01:04:48,416 --> 01:04:50,651
That shit's just banging
against his kneecaps.

1978
01:04:50,652 --> 01:04:52,020
20 bucks that guy's dick

1979
01:04:52,021 --> 01:04:54,689
dips in the toilet
when he takes a shit.

1980
01:04:54,690 --> 01:04:55,922
Whoo!

1981
01:04:55,923 --> 01:04:56,924
(laughs)

1982
01:04:56,925 --> 01:04:57,926
Oh, hey, girl.

1983
01:04:57,927 --> 01:04:59,259
Uh-oh.

1984
01:04:59,260 --> 01:05:00,861
(laughs)

1985
01:05:00,862 --> 01:05:02,497
Oh, yeah.

1986
01:05:02,498 --> 01:05:03,598
Dig that shit!

1987
01:05:03,599 --> 01:05:05,600
Dig that shit!
Who's your daddy?!

1988
01:05:05,601 --> 01:05:07,767
I'm her daddy,
you piece of shit!

1989
01:05:07,768 --> 01:05:09,602
Come to Daddy's bedroom.

1990
01:05:09,603 --> 01:05:11,603
Yeah, it's the master bedroom.

1991
01:05:09,603 --> 01:05:11,638
Ooh!

1992
01:05:11,639 --> 01:05:12,973
Let's move ass!

1993
01:05:12,974 --> 01:05:14,443
Which way are we going here?

1994
01:05:14,444 --> 01:05:15,942
Down, down!

1995
01:05:15,943 --> 01:05:17,779
Right this way, gentlemen.

1996
01:05:17,780 --> 01:05:19,946
Please, after you.

1997
01:05:19,947 --> 01:05:22,952
Thank you, Jamarcus.

1998
01:05:23,952 --> 01:05:25,490
(lock clicks)

1999
01:05:28,490 --> 01:05:29,521
(clears throat)

2000
01:05:29,522 --> 01:05:30,458
It's a nice...

2001
01:05:30,459 --> 01:05:32,091
place you got here, Paul.

2002
01:05:32,092 --> 01:05:33,094
Like the paint.

2003
01:05:33,095 --> 01:05:35,529
Oh, thank you, Evan Trautwig.

2004
01:05:35,530 --> 01:05:38,700
And allow me to pay you
a compliment in kind.

2005
01:05:38,701 --> 01:05:41,736
I see you out there
jog, jog, jog, jogging,

2006
01:05:41,737 --> 01:05:43,103
and I often think to myself,

2007
01:05:43,104 --> 01:05:46,674
my God,
what a perfect specimen...

2008
01:05:46,675 --> 01:05:47,674
Excuse me.

2009
01:05:47,675 --> 01:05:49,576
Two perfect specimens.

2010
01:05:49,577 --> 01:05:52,379
Gentlemen...

2011
01:05:52,380 --> 01:05:54,883
say good-bye to the world
as you know it.

2012
01:05:54,884 --> 01:05:56,884
(moaning loudly)

2013
01:05:56,885 --> 01:05:58,852
More!

2014
01:05:58,853 --> 01:06:01,988
And say hello to paradise.

2015
01:06:01,989 --> 01:06:04,591
(women moaning, grunting)

2016
01:06:04,592 --> 01:06:07,261
Welcome to the sanctuary
of the human spirit, gents,

2017
01:06:07,262 --> 01:06:10,864
because tonight's
all about freedom.

2018
01:06:10,865 --> 01:06:14,734
And, uh, some about boning.

2019
01:06:14,735 --> 01:06:15,736
(chuckles)

2020
01:06:15,737 --> 01:06:17,706
Think we solved
the battery mystery.

2021
01:06:17,707 --> 01:06:19,874
(buzzing, vibrating)

2022
01:06:19,875 --> 01:06:21,108
Come on in, boys.

2023
01:06:21,109 --> 01:06:22,710
The water is just right.

2024
01:06:22,711 --> 01:06:25,113
MAN: Oh, yeah,
cinematography's unreal.

2025
01:06:25,114 --> 01:06:27,014
It's definitely
gonna win Best Picture.

2026
01:06:27,015 --> 01:06:28,582
Yeah. Switch?

2027
01:06:28,583 --> 01:06:30,719
Yeah.

2028
01:06:31,719 --> 01:06:33,788
EVAN:
This is disgusting.

2029
01:06:33,789 --> 01:06:35,823
It stinks in here.
Come on, I was wrong.

2030
01:06:35,824 --> 01:06:37,824
Let's go.

2031
01:06:35,824 --> 01:06:37,192
Hey.

2032
01:06:37,193 --> 01:06:40,160
Do you mind if I suck
on your balls?

2033
01:06:40,161 --> 01:06:42,263
I'm gonna see
how this plays out.

2034
01:06:42,264 --> 01:06:43,698
I'm going.

2035
01:06:43,699 --> 01:06:45,433
Oh, here we go.

2036
01:06:45,434 --> 01:06:47,567
I'll get your name
in due course.

2037
01:06:47,568 --> 01:06:50,638
# I'm fresh, I'm fly,
I'm so damn high #

2038
01:06:50,639 --> 01:06:51,939
Mr. McAllister.

2039
01:06:51,940 --> 01:06:54,309
Mandy, this is quite a
gathering you got cooking here.

2040
01:06:54,310 --> 01:06:55,676
I'm a little surprised.

2041
01:06:55,677 --> 01:06:58,312
It's a little late
for the chess club to be out!

2042
01:06:58,313 --> 01:06:59,780
Come on, what do we got here?

2043
01:06:59,781 --> 01:07:01,180
A little weed, little tequila.

2044
01:07:01,181 --> 01:07:02,382
Where's the
hard stuff, pussies?

2045
01:07:02,383 --> 01:07:03,619
Oh, my God, are you guys twins?

2046
01:07:03,620 --> 01:07:04,619
Yes.

2047
01:07:03,619 --> 01:07:04,785
Yes.

2048
01:07:04,786 --> 01:07:06,320
Oh, my gosh, I can't even
tell you guys apart.

2049
01:07:06,321 --> 01:07:07,621
I'm kidding! I'm kidding!

2050
01:07:07,622 --> 01:07:09,622
Slow down!
You kids are out of your mind!

2051
01:07:09,623 --> 01:07:11,559
It's, like, I feel like
the three of us just met,

2052
01:07:11,560 --> 01:07:13,560
but I feel like
I'm the triplet in a weird way,

2053
01:07:13,561 --> 01:07:15,327
but in, like, like,
in a sexual way.

2054
01:07:15,328 --> 01:07:16,664
Like, where do we
take it from here?

2055
01:07:16,665 --> 01:07:18,933
I'm located about
45 minutes south of here.

2056
01:07:18,934 --> 01:07:20,200
I live with my mom.

2057
01:07:20,201 --> 01:07:21,836
Look, I'm not here
to break up the party.

2058
01:07:21,837 --> 01:07:23,836
I want you kids
to get hopped up.

2059
01:07:21,836 --> 01:07:23,870
Oh, wow. Wow.

2060
01:07:23,871 --> 01:07:25,939
But I'm looking for
a Chelsea McAllister.

2061
01:07:25,940 --> 01:07:27,340
Anyone here know
where she might be?

2062
01:07:27,341 --> 01:07:29,010
You guys know
who I'm talking about, right?

2063
01:07:29,011 --> 01:07:32,212
(music playing faintly
in distance)

2064
01:07:32,213 --> 01:07:34,616
(grunts softly)

2065
01:07:34,617 --> 01:07:38,618
Um, maybe we should
go back to the party.

2066
01:07:38,619 --> 01:07:39,687
No.

2067
01:07:39,688 --> 01:07:40,956
I want to keep doing this.

2068
01:07:40,957 --> 01:07:42,089
Um...

2069
01:07:42,090 --> 01:07:45,225
Okay, I just think we're
going a little fast.

2070
01:07:45,226 --> 01:07:46,761
We're not.

2071
01:07:46,762 --> 01:07:47,795
This is amazing.

2072
01:07:47,796 --> 01:07:50,330
We should keep moving
at this exact pace.

2073
01:07:50,331 --> 01:07:52,033
Maybe even a little bit faster.

2074
01:07:52,034 --> 01:07:54,033
Okay, seriously,
Jason, stop it.

2075
01:07:54,034 --> 01:07:55,168
Seriously, Chelsea,

2076
01:07:55,169 --> 01:07:56,170
I don't want to.

2077
01:07:55,170 --> 01:07:56,971
Chelsea?

2078
01:07:56,972 --> 01:07:58,238
Dad?

2079
01:07:58,239 --> 01:08:00,239
What are you doing here?

2080
01:07:58,239 --> 01:08:00,107
What the hell?!

2081
01:08:00,108 --> 01:08:02,176
Dude, get out of here!

2082
01:08:02,177 --> 01:08:03,176
Let's just go.

2083
01:08:03,177 --> 01:08:04,245
Are you okay?

2084
01:08:04,246 --> 01:08:05,546
Ruining this.

2085
01:08:05,547 --> 01:08:07,180
(sighs)

2086
01:08:07,181 --> 01:08:08,681
Catch you later, Chelse.

2087
01:08:08,682 --> 01:08:10,884
Oh, shit.

2088
01:08:10,885 --> 01:08:12,218
Hey!

2089
01:08:12,219 --> 01:08:14,120
Hey, jackass!

2090
01:08:14,121 --> 01:08:15,922
I'm talking to you, prick!

2091
01:08:15,923 --> 01:08:18,192
You think you're cute,
you little fuck?!

2092
01:08:18,193 --> 01:08:19,193
(grunts)

2093
01:08:18,193 --> 01:08:19,060
Oh, my God!

2094
01:08:19,061 --> 01:08:20,661
(crowd gasps, murmurs)

2095
01:08:20,662 --> 01:08:21,996
(coughing)

2096
01:08:21,997 --> 01:08:22,996
Ouch.

2097
01:08:22,997 --> 01:08:26,136
That looks like
a real gusher, Bob.

2098
01:08:28,136 --> 01:08:29,737
Come here, come here!

2099
01:08:29,738 --> 01:08:30,871
Dad!

2100
01:08:30,872 --> 01:08:32,872
(crowd gasps)

2101
01:08:32,873 --> 01:08:34,774
Dad!

2102
01:08:34,775 --> 01:08:35,910
(groans)

2103
01:08:35,911 --> 01:08:37,144
Oh, my God.

2104
01:08:37,145 --> 01:08:38,679
Are you okay, Dad?

2105
01:08:38,680 --> 01:08:40,019
I'm okay.
It just stung a little bit.

2106
01:08:44,019 --> 01:08:45,818
You don't fuck with Bob.

2107
01:08:45,819 --> 01:08:47,353
You show Bob respect.

2108
01:08:47,354 --> 01:08:48,489
(chuckles):
Okay.

2109
01:08:48,490 --> 01:08:50,162
Bob's my special guy.

2110
01:08:54,162 --> 01:08:55,429
That's right.

2111
01:08:55,430 --> 01:08:57,297
That's right, that
just happened.

2112
01:08:57,298 --> 01:08:59,266
You don't tell your parents
about this.

2113
01:08:59,267 --> 01:09:00,769
You don't tell
your friends about this.

2114
01:09:00,770 --> 01:09:03,403
You write it in your
dream journal, you lock it up,

2115
01:09:03,404 --> 01:09:05,471
and you put it
under your pillow.

2116
01:09:05,472 --> 01:09:06,608
I will come back here

2117
01:09:06,609 --> 01:09:08,746
and I will kill
each and every one of you!

2118
01:09:10,746 --> 01:09:12,746
Except for those two hot girls
I was talking to.

2119
01:09:12,747 --> 01:09:14,281
They have my information,
please have them

2120
01:09:14,282 --> 01:09:15,850
get in contact with me;
They seem great.

2121
01:09:15,851 --> 01:09:17,917
No, I'm glad
you showed up tonight.

2122
01:09:17,918 --> 01:09:19,053
I'm sorry.

2123
01:09:19,054 --> 01:09:21,054
It's okay, honey.

2124
01:09:21,055 --> 01:09:22,657
Come on, let's go home.

2125
01:09:22,658 --> 01:09:23,536
Okay.

2126
01:09:33,536 --> 01:09:34,602
Daddy?

2127
01:09:34,603 --> 01:09:36,203
I'm okay, honey.
I think you got it all.

2128
01:09:36,204 --> 01:09:37,670
You can put it away.

2129
01:09:37,671 --> 01:09:39,671
You doing all right?

2130
01:09:37,671 --> 01:09:39,005
Mm-hmm.

2131
01:09:39,006 --> 01:09:41,006
Good.

2132
01:09:39,006 --> 01:09:41,142
Hey, Bob, can I talk
to you for a second?

2133
01:09:41,143 --> 01:09:42,011
Yeah, sure.

2134
01:09:44,011 --> 01:09:45,678
Okay, honey, I'll
be in in a second.

2135
01:09:45,679 --> 01:09:46,478
All right.

2136
01:09:46,479 --> 01:09:47,682
I love you so much.

2137
01:09:47,683 --> 01:09:49,752
I love you, too.

2138
01:09:50,752 --> 01:09:52,486
I appreciate you showing up.

2139
01:09:52,487 --> 01:09:55,555
I know it takes a big man
to apologize.

2140
01:09:55,556 --> 01:09:58,192
What happened
back there was not cool.

2141
01:09:58,193 --> 01:09:59,492
You abandoned your post.

2142
01:09:59,493 --> 01:10:02,062
If that had been an alien hive,
we would have been killed.

2143
01:10:02,063 --> 01:10:03,161
So, it wasn't a hive?

2144
01:10:03,162 --> 01:10:04,162
Where's Jamarcus?

2145
01:10:04,163 --> 01:10:05,634
Jamarcus decided
to stay at Paul's.

2146
01:10:05,635 --> 01:10:07,167
And no, it wasn't a hive.

2147
01:10:07,168 --> 01:10:09,504
It turned out
to be a local orgy.

2148
01:10:09,505 --> 01:10:11,505
What?

2149
01:10:09,505 --> 01:10:11,772
There's an orgy happening?
Locally?

2150
01:10:11,773 --> 01:10:14,375
So, wait, y-you're mad at
me for leaving an orgy?

2151
01:10:14,376 --> 01:10:15,476
Doesn't matter what it was.

2152
01:10:15,477 --> 01:10:17,077
The point is
you left us hanging.

2153
01:10:17,078 --> 01:10:18,111
It's the principle.

2154
01:10:18,112 --> 01:10:19,513
No, the principle
is I went to go

2155
01:10:19,514 --> 01:10:20,815
help my daughter
who was in trouble.

2156
01:10:20,816 --> 01:10:22,950
Evan, you can't be such
a control freak, man.

2157
01:10:22,951 --> 01:10:24,251
You're too uptight.

2158
01:10:24,252 --> 01:10:26,185
Yeah, Bob, I'm uptight.

2159
01:10:26,186 --> 01:10:27,421
I'm uptight about the aliens

2160
01:10:27,422 --> 01:10:29,422
that are killing people
in our neighborhood.

2161
01:10:29,423 --> 01:10:31,192
That's what I'm uptight about.

2162
01:10:31,193 --> 01:10:32,528
Neighborhood Watch
isn't for people

2163
01:10:32,529 --> 01:10:34,661
who can't handle
their daughter's personal shit.

2164
01:10:34,662 --> 01:10:36,663
Do you even hear
how you sound right now?

2165
01:10:36,664 --> 01:10:38,264
Why don't you look at
your own personal life,

2166
01:10:38,265 --> 01:10:39,398
Evan, 'cause you
don't even have one.

2167
01:10:39,399 --> 01:10:40,769
You don't talk to your wife.

2168
01:10:40,770 --> 01:10:42,403
You don't have any friends.

2169
01:10:42,404 --> 01:10:44,404
I have friends.

2170
01:10:42,404 --> 01:10:44,037
No, you don't, man.

2171
01:10:44,038 --> 01:10:45,071
I have tons of friends.

2172
01:10:45,072 --> 01:10:46,304
No, you don't.
You have clubs.

2173
01:10:46,305 --> 01:10:47,307
You start these clubs!
That's what you do!

2174
01:10:47,308 --> 01:10:48,474
And you become a dictator!

2175
01:10:48,475 --> 01:10:50,043
You just boss everyone
and tell them what to do

2176
01:10:50,044 --> 01:10:51,678
because you're running away
from what really matters.

2177
01:10:51,679 --> 01:10:52,946
You don't have the
guts to deal with

2178
01:10:52,947 --> 01:10:54,282
what's going on
in your own home.

2179
01:10:54,283 --> 01:10:56,283
Yeah, well...

2180
01:10:56,284 --> 01:10:59,153
I have the guts to do this.

2181
01:10:59,154 --> 01:11:00,621
You're out of the Watch.

2182
01:11:00,622 --> 01:11:03,157
You can't throw me
out of the Watch.

2183
01:11:03,158 --> 01:11:04,759
I just did.

2184
01:11:04,760 --> 01:11:05,961
Okay. You know what?
I don't care.

2185
01:11:05,962 --> 01:11:07,961
I'm gonna start my own watch.

2186
01:11:05,961 --> 01:11:07,228
You know what?

2187
01:11:07,229 --> 01:11:09,062
You can't, because
there already is a watch!

2188
01:11:09,063 --> 01:11:10,164
So you can't do that.

2189
01:11:10,165 --> 01:11:11,799
Oh, yes, I can start my watch,

2190
01:11:11,800 --> 01:11:13,701
'cause if I'm not
in your watch,

2191
01:11:13,702 --> 01:11:15,769
you can't give me
rules anymore.

2192
01:11:15,770 --> 01:11:17,438
I'm gonna keep
my own logo, too.

2193
01:11:17,439 --> 01:11:19,439
I never liked that logo anyway.

2194
01:11:19,440 --> 01:11:20,574
My logo is awesome!

2195
01:11:20,575 --> 01:11:22,076
My logo is "Chinee."

2196
01:11:22,077 --> 01:11:24,278
The "Chinee"
understand movement,

2197
01:11:24,279 --> 01:11:26,179
and I understand the Chinese.

2198
01:11:26,180 --> 01:11:30,550
I combined flight
with flames with a tiger.

2199
01:11:30,551 --> 01:11:32,251
What am I combining, Evan?

2200
01:11:32,252 --> 01:11:33,386
Serenity,

2201
01:11:33,387 --> 01:11:36,756
optimism, attack!

2202
01:11:36,757 --> 01:11:39,760
Franklin, let's get
some pudding inside you.

2203
01:11:39,761 --> 01:11:41,362
Franklin, you do not
go in that house!

2204
01:11:41,363 --> 01:11:43,464
Jesus, Evan, you don't own him.

2205
01:11:43,465 --> 01:11:45,099
You don't own all of us.

2206
01:11:45,100 --> 01:11:46,867
Franklin is his own man.

2207
01:11:46,868 --> 01:11:48,469
He can make his own decisions.

2208
01:11:48,470 --> 01:11:50,069
He can think for himself.

2209
01:11:50,070 --> 01:11:51,873
Now, Franklin, get your
fucking ass in the house!

2210
01:11:51,874 --> 01:11:53,540
Don't you speak with Franklin!

2211
01:11:53,541 --> 01:11:54,841
Franklin, you stay!

2212
01:11:54,842 --> 01:11:56,077
Franklin, stay!

2213
01:11:56,078 --> 01:11:57,444
Come! Franklin, come!

2214
01:11:57,445 --> 01:11:58,979
Come here!

2215
01:11:58,980 --> 01:12:01,349
Frank, come here, come here,
come here, Franklin.

2216
01:12:01,350 --> 01:12:04,050
Come here, Franklin.

2217
01:12:04,051 --> 01:12:05,319
Franklin, look at me.

2218
01:12:05,320 --> 01:12:06,319
Franklin.

2219
01:12:06,320 --> 01:12:07,519
Franklin, come on.

2220
01:12:07,520 --> 01:12:09,458
Um, Evan,
you're a special friend...

2221
01:12:11,458 --> 01:12:13,470
...but I live here.

2222
01:12:21,470 --> 01:12:25,242
How's it feel, Evan,
to be in a club of one?

2223
01:12:27,242 --> 01:12:29,253
(door closes)

2224
01:12:39,253 --> 01:12:41,927
# #

2225
01:12:46,927 --> 01:12:48,363
Maybe he's jacking off
too much.

2226
01:12:48,364 --> 01:12:49,363
No.

2227
01:12:48,363 --> 01:12:49,594
You know what I mean?

2228
01:12:49,595 --> 01:12:51,532
Like, the well is dry
by the time you get home.

2229
01:12:51,533 --> 01:12:52,532
Ew, stop.

2230
01:12:51,532 --> 01:12:52,699
Well, I don't know.

2231
01:12:52,700 --> 01:12:53,868
Have you noticed, like,

2232
01:12:53,869 --> 01:12:56,370
any abrasions or signs
of stress on his penis?

2233
01:12:56,371 --> 01:12:57,772
Abrasions? No.

2234
01:12:57,773 --> 01:13:00,072
Well, like,
he's pulling on it too hard.

2235
01:13:00,073 --> 01:13:01,340
(panting)

2236
01:13:01,341 --> 01:13:03,143
I'm sterile.

2237
01:13:03,144 --> 01:13:05,248
Bye-bye.

2238
01:13:08,248 --> 01:13:10,248
- Hey, Carla.
- Hey.

2239
01:13:10,252 --> 01:13:12,653
Honey, I can't have kids.

2240
01:13:12,654 --> 01:13:15,422
I went to a doctor
and got it checked out.

2241
01:13:15,423 --> 01:13:17,625
And I am barren.

2242
01:13:17,626 --> 01:13:19,426
It's me, it's not you.

2243
01:13:19,427 --> 01:13:21,094
It's not the both of us,
it's me.

2244
01:13:21,095 --> 01:13:23,831
And I've been trying to
tell you, but just every time

2245
01:13:23,832 --> 01:13:27,768
you wanted to have sex,
it was all I could think about.

2246
01:13:27,769 --> 01:13:30,440
And I didn't know
how to tell you, so I...

2247
01:13:33,440 --> 01:13:35,475
I mean, I mean, why?

2248
01:13:35,476 --> 01:13:36,778
Why wouldn't you tell me?

2249
01:13:36,779 --> 01:13:38,679
Isn't that the kind of thing

2250
01:13:38,680 --> 01:13:42,015
that couples figure
out together?

2251
01:13:42,016 --> 01:13:45,822
I just knew how much
you wanted this, and...

2252
01:13:47,822 --> 01:13:49,822
...I didn't want
to let you down.

2253
01:13:49,823 --> 01:13:52,593
Yeah, but I want this.

2254
01:13:52,594 --> 01:13:55,062
More than anything.

2255
01:13:55,063 --> 01:13:57,730
And... I don't know,

2256
01:13:57,731 --> 01:14:01,734
we can figure all
that other stuff out.

2257
01:14:01,735 --> 01:14:05,238
All I ever wanted was
for us to be a team.

2258
01:14:05,239 --> 01:14:08,309
That's all I ever wanted.

2259
01:14:08,310 --> 01:14:09,676
Honey, oh...

2260
01:14:09,677 --> 01:14:11,081
No more secrets, okay?

2261
01:14:13,081 --> 01:14:14,447
Actually...

2262
01:14:14,448 --> 01:14:18,652
there is one more secret.

2263
01:14:18,653 --> 01:14:21,488
(sighs):
Okay.

2264
01:14:21,489 --> 01:14:22,489
(doorbell rings)

2265
01:14:22,490 --> 01:14:24,261
(urgent knocking on door)

2266
01:14:26,261 --> 01:14:29,261
Hey, Evan.

2267
01:14:26,261 --> 01:14:29,196
Jamarcus, you know what,
now's not a good time.

2268
01:14:29,197 --> 01:14:30,629
Okay, well, I need
to tell you something.

2269
01:14:30,630 --> 01:14:33,098
I know. I just need to be
with my wife right now.

2270
01:14:33,099 --> 01:14:34,233
This is more important.

2271
01:14:34,234 --> 01:14:35,636
Whatever it is, it isn't.

2272
01:14:35,637 --> 01:14:36,870
Trust me.

2273
01:14:36,871 --> 01:14:39,205
We need to get the
Neighborhood Watch together now.

2274
01:14:39,206 --> 01:14:41,174
Do you want another one?
That gonna hold you over?

2275
01:14:41,175 --> 01:14:42,912
I'll eat more pudding
if you have more.

2276
01:14:45,912 --> 01:14:48,249
I don't know that I'm open
to an apology yet.

2277
01:14:48,250 --> 01:14:49,817
You serious?

2278
01:14:49,818 --> 01:14:52,088
Jamarcus, what's going on?

2279
01:14:54,088 --> 01:14:55,221
Oh...

2280
01:14:55,222 --> 01:14:56,726
The fuck?

2281
01:14:58,726 --> 01:15:00,662
Oh, my God.

2282
01:15:01,662 --> 01:15:03,030
Is that a...
like, a parlor trick?

2283
01:15:03,031 --> 01:15:06,133
It's okay. It's okay.

2284
01:15:06,134 --> 01:15:07,672
Touch my goo, Bob.

2285
01:15:11,672 --> 01:15:12,873
Feels like cum.

2286
01:15:12,874 --> 01:15:14,841
Holy fuck, it feels like cum!

2287
01:15:14,842 --> 01:15:16,842
What?

2288
01:15:14,842 --> 01:15:16,943
He's a fucking alien!

2289
01:15:16,944 --> 01:15:18,746
You stay the fuck back,
Jamarcus!

2290
01:15:18,747 --> 01:15:20,647
All right, what the
hell is going on?

2291
01:15:20,648 --> 01:15:21,947
Franklin, I'm not here
to hurt you.

2292
01:15:21,948 --> 01:15:23,920
Believe me, I've had
many chances to kill you.

2293
01:15:24,920 --> 01:15:26,088
You're one of them?

2294
01:15:28,088 --> 01:15:30,191
You're an alien?

2295
01:15:30,192 --> 01:15:32,127
Look, our ship came here
six months ago,

2296
01:15:32,128 --> 01:15:34,260
and we've been hiding
ever since.

2297
01:15:34,261 --> 01:15:38,031
We inhabited your human form
to infiltrate your society

2298
01:15:38,032 --> 01:15:40,434
and learn your weaknesses,
but instead...

2299
01:15:40,435 --> 01:15:42,870
Why is this thing still talking?
Let's kill him.

2300
01:15:42,871 --> 01:15:45,238
Because, in a few hours,

2301
01:15:45,239 --> 01:15:47,207
our transmitter
will become operational.

2302
01:15:47,208 --> 01:15:51,644
When it signals, our armada
will commence a global invasion

2303
01:15:51,645 --> 01:15:54,581
starting here in Glenview,
which is clearly

2304
01:15:54,582 --> 01:15:56,582
not ideal for you.

2305
01:15:54,582 --> 01:15:56,683
What?

2306
01:15:56,684 --> 01:15:58,684
Why?

2307
01:15:56,684 --> 01:15:58,285
We're aliens.

2308
01:15:58,286 --> 01:16:00,520
That's we do...
we come to planets,

2309
01:16:00,521 --> 01:16:02,488
we destroy them, we move on.

2310
01:16:02,489 --> 01:16:04,357
Wait a minute.

2311
01:16:04,358 --> 01:16:06,193
Did you kill Antonio?

2312
01:16:06,194 --> 01:16:07,961
No. God, of course not.

2313
01:16:07,962 --> 01:16:10,363
I know who did.
His name's Flertrok.

2314
01:16:10,364 --> 01:16:12,500
The man is a fucking cunt.

2315
01:16:12,501 --> 01:16:14,868
Where is this transmitter thing?

2316
01:16:14,869 --> 01:16:17,573
The only place big enough
with enough power and supplies.

2317
01:16:19,573 --> 01:16:20,974
Costco?

2318
01:16:20,975 --> 01:16:22,541
Yeah.

2319
01:16:22,542 --> 01:16:25,813
You've been planning
an alien invasion in my Costco?

2320
01:16:25,814 --> 01:16:27,912
You really do have everything
you need under one roof.

2321
01:16:27,913 --> 01:16:29,281
BOB: Why are you
telling us this

2322
01:16:29,282 --> 01:16:31,017
if we don't have
any time to stop it?

2323
01:16:31,018 --> 01:16:32,887
What kind of sick fucking
head game are you playing?

2324
01:16:32,888 --> 01:16:34,955
Well, because
there's good news.

2325
01:16:34,956 --> 01:16:36,856
If you leave now,
you will survive

2326
01:16:36,857 --> 01:16:38,392
the initial invasion,

2327
01:16:38,393 --> 01:16:40,426
and after that,
if you take to the desert

2328
01:16:40,427 --> 01:16:43,397
and live in caves and crevices,
you could, you know, live

2329
01:16:43,398 --> 01:16:45,898
with moderate dignity
for most of your lives.

2330
01:16:45,899 --> 01:16:47,868
I don't believe
a word he's saying.

2331
01:16:47,869 --> 01:16:49,469
He betrayed the Watch.

2332
01:16:49,470 --> 01:16:51,405
JAMARCUS: Yes, but since
then, I've come to know

2333
01:16:51,406 --> 01:16:55,242
humanity's compassion and...
and beauty and... and love.

2334
01:16:55,243 --> 01:16:57,510
I don't want to lie anymore.

2335
01:16:57,511 --> 01:17:00,480
And also, the ball sucking
was a real eye opener.

2336
01:17:00,481 --> 01:17:02,049
Look, I'm not going to ask

2337
01:17:02,050 --> 01:17:05,453
for your forgiveness,
because I don't deserve it.

2338
01:17:06,453 --> 01:17:07,753
I'm really sorry.

2339
01:17:09,090 --> 01:17:10,624
Just go.

2340
01:17:10,625 --> 01:17:12,564
Okay.

2341
01:17:16,564 --> 01:17:17,698
Please, save yourselves

2342
01:17:17,699 --> 01:17:19,203
while there's still time.

2343
01:17:22,203 --> 01:17:23,703
ABBY: What the hell
is happening?

2344
01:17:23,704 --> 01:17:25,405
FRANKLIN: Well, if we don't
leave here right now,

2345
01:17:25,406 --> 01:17:26,406
we're going to die.

2346
01:17:26,407 --> 01:17:27,440
Guys, are you actually talking

2347
01:17:27,441 --> 01:17:28,710
about giving up
and leaving Glenview?

2348
01:17:28,711 --> 01:17:30,410
EVAN: No, I think
we go and...

2349
01:17:30,411 --> 01:17:31,443
and alert the authorities,

2350
01:17:31,444 --> 01:17:33,213
get as many people out
as possible.

2351
01:17:33,214 --> 01:17:34,415
And then what?

2352
01:17:34,416 --> 01:17:35,447
And then... I don't know.

2353
01:17:35,448 --> 01:17:36,484
FRANKLIN:
Evan's right.

2354
01:17:36,485 --> 01:17:38,117
We need to hit the caves.

2355
01:17:38,118 --> 01:17:40,152
Guys, we're not going to let
Glenview become ground zero

2356
01:17:40,153 --> 01:17:42,222
for an alien invasion
and not do something about it.

2357
01:17:42,223 --> 01:17:44,291
We're the Neighborhood Watch.

2358
01:17:44,292 --> 01:17:45,992
This is what we do.

2359
01:17:45,993 --> 01:17:47,259
No, Bob, come on.

2360
01:17:47,260 --> 01:17:49,094
It's what we did...
or never really did,

2361
01:17:49,095 --> 01:17:50,564
because we didn't
really do anything.

2362
01:17:50,565 --> 01:17:51,698
Until now.

2363
01:17:51,699 --> 01:17:53,098
I say, tonight, we change that.

2364
01:17:53,099 --> 01:17:54,666
Evan, you started
the neighborhood watch

2365
01:17:54,667 --> 01:17:55,935
because you believed
in something.

2366
01:17:55,936 --> 01:17:58,104
You believed in this town.

2367
01:17:58,105 --> 01:17:59,237
You believed in these people.

2368
01:17:59,238 --> 01:18:00,873
You believed in us.
And damn it, I still do.

2369
01:18:00,874 --> 01:18:02,243
We're not going to let
a bunch of aliens

2370
01:18:02,244 --> 01:18:04,478
waltz in here and do
whatever the hell

2371
01:18:04,479 --> 01:18:05,579
they want to do.

2372
01:18:05,580 --> 01:18:06,947
I say, not on our watch.

2373
01:18:06,948 --> 01:18:09,448
I say they drew the short straw
when they picked Glenview.

2374
01:18:09,449 --> 01:18:10,683
Now, come on, guys,

2375
01:18:10,684 --> 01:18:12,019
and get your heads right.

2376
01:18:12,020 --> 01:18:14,520
This neighborhood's
going to need our best tonight.

2377
01:18:14,521 --> 01:18:18,925
Evan, some aliens
just set up tents in your store.

2378
01:18:18,926 --> 01:18:21,730
What do you want to do about it?

2379
01:18:22,730 --> 01:18:25,635
Costco is for members only.

2380
01:18:27,635 --> 01:18:28,936
Let's take out that transmitter.

2381
01:18:28,937 --> 01:18:31,005
Now we're talking.

2382
01:18:31,006 --> 01:18:32,805
All right, Watch.

2383
01:18:32,806 --> 01:18:34,675
This is it.

2384
01:18:34,676 --> 01:18:36,076
Now it gets real.

2385
01:18:36,077 --> 01:18:37,679
That's a cute
ten-milly Beretta, Bobby.

2386
01:18:37,680 --> 01:18:41,282
But I say we make
a little pit stop at my house.

2387
01:18:41,283 --> 01:18:43,127
# #

2388
01:18:52,127 --> 01:18:55,028
# I was a moving man #

2389
01:18:55,029 --> 01:18:58,031
# In my younger days... #

2390
01:18:58,032 --> 01:19:00,501
Welcome to the candy shop,
motherfuckers.

2391
01:19:00,502 --> 01:19:01,734
Jesus.

2392
01:19:01,735 --> 01:19:03,735
Nice.

2393
01:19:01,735 --> 01:19:03,603
Holy shit.

2394
01:19:03,604 --> 01:19:05,270
Ladies first.

2395
01:19:05,271 --> 01:19:06,105
Oh.

2396
01:19:06,106 --> 01:19:08,943
This one looks cute.
(chuckles)

2397
01:19:08,944 --> 01:19:10,911
Cute and deadly.

2398
01:19:10,912 --> 01:19:13,912
Just like me.

2399
01:19:10,912 --> 01:19:13,080
Ew.

2400
01:19:13,081 --> 01:19:14,515
FRANKLIN'S MOM:
Franklin, what are you doing?

2401
01:19:14,516 --> 01:19:15,849
Who are these people?

2402
01:19:15,850 --> 01:19:17,051
And what are you doing
with these guns?

2403
01:19:17,052 --> 01:19:19,118
Goddamn it, Mom,
stay the fuck out of my room!

2404
01:19:19,119 --> 01:19:20,854
I don't go through your shit!

2405
01:19:20,855 --> 01:19:22,189
I don't touch your butterflies!

2406
01:19:22,190 --> 01:19:23,489
Franklin.

2407
01:19:23,490 --> 01:19:25,057
Stay the fuck out. All right,
everyone out of my room.

2408
01:19:25,058 --> 01:19:26,226
Everyone out of my room.

2409
01:19:26,227 --> 01:19:27,895
Everyone leave. Everyone leave.
Everyone out.

2410
01:19:27,896 --> 01:19:29,895
- I got shit I have to do.
- Nice to meet you.

2411
01:19:27,895 --> 01:19:29,862
Politeness, yeah.

2412
01:19:29,863 --> 01:19:32,064
It was a pleasure.

2413
01:19:32,065 --> 01:19:33,133
(whispering):
I'm sorry, Mama.

2414
01:19:33,134 --> 01:19:34,634
I was trying to
impress my friends.

2415
01:19:34,635 --> 01:19:36,069
I was trying to be a big man.

2416
01:19:36,070 --> 01:19:38,839
I love you. Stay inside
the house tonight, okay?

2417
01:19:38,840 --> 01:19:40,407
What...

2418
01:19:40,408 --> 01:19:42,944
You're an angel.

2419
01:19:44,944 --> 01:19:47,518
(engine revving,
tires screeching)

2420
01:19:49,518 --> 01:19:51,152
<i>BRESSMAN (over phone):
Glenview PD.</i>

2421
01:19:51,153 --> 01:19:53,152
<i>This is Sergeant Bressman.</i>

2422
01:19:51,152 --> 01:19:53,053
<i>EVAN: Bressman?</i>

2423
01:19:53,054 --> 01:19:55,087
It's Evan Trautwig.
Listen to me very carefully.

2424
01:19:55,088 --> 01:19:57,724
There is an alien invasion
happening at the Costco.

2425
01:19:57,725 --> 01:20:00,827
I know it sounds crazy, but you
got to get down there right now.

2426
01:20:00,828 --> 01:20:01,994
BRESSMAN:
Oh, an alien invasion?

2427
01:20:01,995 --> 01:20:03,130
Really? At-at Costco?

2428
01:20:03,131 --> 01:20:05,564
Right now?
Oh, great, I'm on my way.

2429
01:20:05,565 --> 01:20:06,966
Oh, wait, no, I'm not.

2430
01:20:06,967 --> 01:20:09,502
I'm still here for some reason.

2431
01:20:09,503 --> 01:20:10,971
G-Give me the phone.
Give me the phone.

2432
01:20:10,972 --> 01:20:12,839
Bressman, you were right.

2433
01:20:12,840 --> 01:20:13,973
Trautwig is the Costco killer.

2434
01:20:13,974 --> 01:20:15,510
He's going to take us
to Costco right now

2435
01:20:15,511 --> 01:20:17,611
and kill us.
You got to help us. Aah!

2436
01:20:17,612 --> 01:20:18,911
He's coming.

2437
01:20:18,912 --> 01:20:20,912
Really?

2438
01:20:18,912 --> 01:20:20,046
Yeah.

2439
01:20:20,047 --> 01:20:21,358
He believed that?

2440
01:20:30,358 --> 01:20:32,765
# #

2441
01:20:37,765 --> 01:20:39,166
Look.

2442
01:20:39,167 --> 01:20:41,367
ABBY: Oh, my God.
That's an alien.

2443
01:20:41,368 --> 01:20:42,870
I-I-I...

2444
01:20:42,871 --> 01:20:44,871
I'm looking at an alien.

2445
01:20:42,871 --> 01:20:44,737
BOB: I know.

2446
01:20:44,738 --> 01:20:46,272
It can be a total mind-fuck.

2447
01:20:46,273 --> 01:20:48,242
What do we do, bust in
the front door, guns blazing?

2448
01:20:48,243 --> 01:20:50,477
I love the enthusiasm,
Frank 'n' Beans,

2449
01:20:50,478 --> 01:20:51,843
but I think we're going to need

2450
01:20:51,844 --> 01:20:53,079
a different kind
of strategy here.

2451
01:20:53,080 --> 01:20:55,681
There's only one way
underneath the store.

2452
01:20:55,682 --> 01:20:58,785
It's through the drainage grate
in frozen foods.

2453
01:20:58,786 --> 01:21:00,386
When we rebuilt
the tire section,

2454
01:21:00,387 --> 01:21:02,889
we put shelving
over the trash chute,

2455
01:21:02,890 --> 01:21:05,528
but we never sealed it off.

2456
01:21:06,528 --> 01:21:08,631
Stay behind me.

2457
01:21:11,631 --> 01:21:13,036
Let's go.

2458
01:21:16,036 --> 01:21:17,938
Pop this bitch open.

2459
01:21:17,939 --> 01:21:21,573
I'll cover you.

2460
01:21:21,574 --> 01:21:23,778
Come on, let's go, guys.
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

2461
01:21:23,779 --> 01:21:25,312
I can't...

2462
01:21:25,313 --> 01:21:26,513
Shh.

2463
01:21:26,514 --> 01:21:29,927
Do you have nails?
Do you have nails?

2464
01:21:39,927 --> 01:21:42,435
# #

2465
01:21:48,435 --> 01:21:50,469
(walkie-talkie beeps,
feedback squeals)

2466
01:21:50,470 --> 01:21:53,072
BOB: He's guarding the grate.
Are you guys in position?

2467
01:21:53,073 --> 01:21:55,475
In position.

2468
01:21:55,476 --> 01:21:57,711
This is exciting.

2469
01:21:57,712 --> 01:21:59,211
Okay.

2470
01:21:59,212 --> 01:22:00,648
All right, we shoot
him on three.

2471
01:22:00,649 --> 01:22:03,383
I repeat... shoot on three.

2472
01:22:03,384 --> 01:22:05,519
One. Two.

2473
01:22:05,520 --> 01:22:07,520
Three!

2474
01:22:05,520 --> 01:22:07,554
(door banging open)

2475
01:22:07,555 --> 01:22:09,956
Freeze, Trautwig.

2476
01:22:09,957 --> 01:22:11,456
Game over.

2477
01:22:11,457 --> 01:22:13,457
Where'd it go?
Did you see it?

2478
01:22:11,457 --> 01:22:13,026
I don't know.

2479
01:22:13,027 --> 01:22:15,095
You're under arrest for the
murder of Manfred Salisbury,

2480
01:22:15,096 --> 01:22:16,095
Antonio Guzman

2481
01:22:15,095 --> 01:22:16,395
Shh! Shh!

2482
01:22:16,396 --> 01:22:18,197
And that little
punk skater kid.

2483
01:22:18,198 --> 01:22:19,198
(whispering): Shut up.

2484
01:22:18,198 --> 01:22:19,431
Drop the guns.

2485
01:22:19,432 --> 01:22:20,635
You don't understand
what's happening.

2486
01:22:20,636 --> 01:22:22,635
There's aliens in the store.

2487
01:22:20,635 --> 01:22:22,803
Oh, yeah?

2488
01:22:22,804 --> 01:22:24,203
Aliens? Where?

2489
01:22:24,204 --> 01:22:26,104
It was right over there
until you scared it.

2490
01:22:26,105 --> 01:22:27,205
Now, keep your mouth down.

2491
01:22:27,206 --> 01:22:28,973
Oh, aliens who are
scared by the sound

2492
01:22:28,974 --> 01:22:29,975
- of a door opening.
- Shh!

2493
01:22:29,976 --> 01:22:31,175
BRESSMAN:
Look out, Earth.

2494
01:22:31,176 --> 01:22:32,279
You've met your match.

2495
01:22:32,280 --> 01:22:33,279
Drop the guns!

2496
01:22:32,279 --> 01:22:33,580
EVAN: no, we're not

2497
01:22:33,581 --> 01:22:35,448
going to drop our guns,
because there are aliens here.

2498
01:22:35,449 --> 01:22:37,448
(grunts)

2499
01:22:35,448 --> 01:22:37,250
Chucho, what's up, buddy?

2500
01:22:37,251 --> 01:22:39,118
You got something to say?

2501
01:22:39,119 --> 01:22:40,554
(screams)

2502
01:22:40,555 --> 01:22:43,590
Oh, what the fuck
is that thing?

2503
01:22:43,591 --> 01:22:45,625
(screaming)

2504
01:22:45,626 --> 01:22:46,595
No.

2505
01:22:48,595 --> 01:22:49,862
(roars)

2506
01:22:49,863 --> 01:22:50,833
No!

2507
01:22:52,833 --> 01:22:54,600
BRESSMAN:
Fuck! Fuck!

2508
01:22:54,601 --> 01:22:55,769
Shit! Oh!

2509
01:22:55,770 --> 01:22:57,775
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck!

2510
01:23:02,775 --> 01:23:04,043
BRESSMAN:
Chucho.

2511
01:23:04,044 --> 01:23:06,278
(sobbing):
Oh, Chucho, Chucho.

2512
01:23:06,279 --> 01:23:08,648
Oh, stay with me, buddy.

2513
01:23:08,649 --> 01:23:09,715
Stay with me.

2514
01:23:09,716 --> 01:23:10,951
Oh, no, no, no, Chucho.

2515
01:23:10,952 --> 01:23:12,586
Come on, come on, come on.

2516
01:23:12,587 --> 01:23:13,688
Come on, stay with me.

2517
01:23:13,689 --> 01:23:16,688
Stay with me. Come on.

2518
01:23:13,688 --> 01:23:16,290
BOB: His, uh...

2519
01:23:16,291 --> 01:23:17,723
his heart is out
of his body, fella.

2520
01:23:17,724 --> 01:23:19,357
I-I don't think he's
going to make it.

2521
01:23:19,358 --> 01:23:21,029
What? No, no,
he's going to make it.

2522
01:23:21,030 --> 01:23:22,728
Come on! Come on!

2523
01:23:22,729 --> 01:23:24,331
Listen, cop!

2524
01:23:24,332 --> 01:23:26,432
You got a lot of shit you need
to brought up to speed on,

2525
01:23:26,433 --> 01:23:27,700
and I, for one,
don't have the goddamn time

2526
01:23:27,701 --> 01:23:29,270
to hold your hand
and walk you through it.

2527
01:23:29,271 --> 01:23:30,903
First, aliens exist.

2528
01:23:30,904 --> 01:23:32,471
Deal with it.

2529
01:23:32,472 --> 01:23:35,175
Second, your boy Chuch,
here, is dead as fuck.

2530
01:23:35,176 --> 01:23:36,407
And there ain't nothing
on God's green Earth

2531
01:23:36,408 --> 01:23:37,710
that's going to
bring him back to us.

2532
01:23:37,711 --> 01:23:40,047
Now, I have a bunch of aliens
underneath this Costco,

2533
01:23:40,048 --> 01:23:42,148
and we are moments away
from this Earth

2534
01:23:42,149 --> 01:23:44,050
being stomped a new asshole.

2535
01:23:44,051 --> 01:23:45,353
Now, I have one
important question,

2536
01:23:45,354 --> 01:23:47,787
and I need you
to answer it for me right now.

2537
01:23:47,788 --> 01:23:49,822
Are you with us?

2538
01:23:49,823 --> 01:23:51,691
Are you a cop?

2539
01:23:51,692 --> 01:23:54,327
No. You rejected me.

2540
01:23:54,328 --> 01:23:57,296
'Cause I was
too awesome for you.

2541
01:23:57,297 --> 01:23:59,065
Well, that was clearly
the biggest

2542
01:23:59,066 --> 01:24:00,599
goddamn mistake I've ever made.

2543
01:24:00,600 --> 01:24:02,635
I'll do whatever you say, kid.

2544
01:24:02,636 --> 01:24:04,504
Lock and load, bitches.

2545
01:24:04,505 --> 01:24:06,639
Anything from outer space,
kill it.

2546
01:24:06,640 --> 01:24:10,819
Come on. That alien was guarding
that grate for a reason.

2547
01:24:17,819 --> 01:24:19,728
(screaming)

2548
01:24:27,728 --> 01:24:30,229
Die! Die!

2549
01:24:30,230 --> 01:24:33,099
You... killed...
my... friend!

2550
01:24:33,100 --> 01:24:34,902
You stupid Flertrok!

2551
01:24:34,903 --> 01:24:36,903
I don't know
if we can confirm or deny

2552
01:24:36,904 --> 01:24:37,969
whether or not that's Flertrok,

2553
01:24:37,970 --> 01:24:39,318
but this thing's
a goner for sure.

2554
01:24:50,318 --> 01:24:51,384
Oh, it hurts.

2555
01:24:51,385 --> 01:24:53,925
(Bressman groaning)

2556
01:24:57,925 --> 01:25:01,461
I guess this is the part
where you leave me to die.

2557
01:25:01,462 --> 01:25:02,327
No, no.

2558
01:25:02,328 --> 01:25:03,696
Uh, you're not going to die.

2559
01:25:03,697 --> 01:25:05,164
Yeah, you're not going to die.

2560
01:25:05,165 --> 01:25:06,867
(whispering): He's going to...
he's going to die.

2561
01:25:06,868 --> 01:25:09,068
You better get some help.

2562
01:25:09,069 --> 01:25:11,036
(loud electronic whirr)

2563
01:25:11,037 --> 01:25:12,404
That doesn't sound good.

2564
01:25:12,405 --> 01:25:13,873
Come on, we got to find
that transmitter.

2565
01:25:13,874 --> 01:25:15,407
Hey.

2566
01:25:15,408 --> 01:25:17,309
Go kill me some aliens, baby.

2567
01:25:17,310 --> 01:25:20,013
All right.

2568
01:25:20,014 --> 01:25:21,613
Okay.

2569
01:25:21,614 --> 01:25:23,916
Hey. I need you to be
strong for me, okay?

2570
01:25:23,917 --> 01:25:25,917
Ew.

2571
01:25:23,917 --> 01:25:25,018
Okay...

2572
01:25:25,019 --> 01:25:26,019
Franklin.

2573
01:25:25,019 --> 01:25:26,420
What's the deal?

2574
01:25:26,421 --> 01:25:27,421
What are we doing?

2575
01:25:26,421 --> 01:25:27,955
All right, you ready?

2576
01:25:27,956 --> 01:25:30,956
Yeah, okay.

2577
01:25:27,956 --> 01:25:30,497
Okay, I'm just
going to lift your arm.

2578
01:25:35,497 --> 01:25:37,770
# #

2579
01:25:43,770 --> 01:25:45,981
Here we go.

2580
01:25:53,981 --> 01:25:55,722
(steam hissing)

2581
01:26:01,722 --> 01:26:04,722
(electronic whirring)

2582
01:26:01,722 --> 01:26:04,925
FRANKLIN: Holy shit.

2583
01:26:04,926 --> 01:26:06,295
JASON:
Gentlemen.

2584
01:26:08,295 --> 01:26:10,596
What the hell are you
doing down here?

2585
01:26:10,597 --> 01:26:11,832
JASON:
Nothing, really.

2586
01:26:11,833 --> 01:26:14,934
Just picking up
some paper towels in bulk.

2587
01:26:14,935 --> 01:26:16,769
Super-big tub of mayo.

2588
01:26:16,770 --> 01:26:17,804
And what else?

2589
01:26:17,805 --> 01:26:19,139
Oh, yeah.

2590
01:26:19,140 --> 01:26:21,541
Transmitting a signal
to my armada

2591
01:26:21,542 --> 01:26:23,108
to destroy your entire race.

2592
01:26:23,109 --> 01:26:24,345
FRANKLIN:
Holy shit!

2593
01:26:24,346 --> 01:26:25,411
He's an alien!

2594
01:26:25,412 --> 01:26:27,184
BOB:
You motherfucker!

2595
01:26:30,184 --> 01:26:32,184
You guys go destroy
the transmitter.

2596
01:26:32,185 --> 01:26:33,719
I'll deal with this jackass.

2597
01:26:33,720 --> 01:26:35,120
No. We're not going to
leave you alone with him.

2598
01:26:35,121 --> 01:26:36,821
Goddamn it, Evan, we don't
have time for this shit.

2599
01:26:36,822 --> 01:26:38,723
Just go, go, go, go, go!
I got him. I got him.

2600
01:26:38,724 --> 01:26:40,728
Bob's right. Look, they have
some shit they have to work out.

2601
01:26:40,729 --> 01:26:43,728
Let's just go. Come on.

2602
01:26:40,728 --> 01:26:43,029
Okay, you be careful.

2603
01:26:43,030 --> 01:26:45,098
Okay. Okay, Bob.

2604
01:26:45,099 --> 01:26:46,837
You can do this.

2605
01:26:50,837 --> 01:26:52,839
(grunting)

2606
01:26:52,840 --> 01:26:54,474
Come on, Bob.

2607
01:26:54,475 --> 01:26:55,847
This is too easy.

2608
01:27:00,847 --> 01:27:01,847
(grunting)

2609
01:27:06,119 --> 01:27:07,920
Whoo!

2610
01:27:07,921 --> 01:27:09,390
Yeah!

2611
01:27:10,390 --> 01:27:12,796
(grunting):
God.

2612
01:27:15,796 --> 01:27:17,096
Oh, my God.

2613
01:27:17,097 --> 01:27:19,232
What do we do?

2614
01:27:19,233 --> 01:27:20,438
I have an idea.

2615
01:27:24,438 --> 01:27:25,407
(bullet ricochets)

2616
01:27:27,407 --> 01:27:29,311
My idea didn't work.

2617
01:27:31,311 --> 01:27:33,750
(roars)

2618
01:27:36,750 --> 01:27:38,216
(roars)

2619
01:27:38,217 --> 01:27:40,523
Evan, they're not dying!

2620
01:27:42,523 --> 01:27:43,658
I'm out of bullets.

2621
01:27:44,658 --> 01:27:46,358
So am I.

2622
01:27:46,359 --> 01:27:47,559
It's going to be an honor

2623
01:27:47,560 --> 01:27:49,001
getting skinned alive
next to you.

2624
01:27:54,001 --> 01:27:55,301
What is happening?

2625
01:27:57,537 --> 01:27:59,744
FRANKLIN:
Why are their dicks exploding?

2626
01:28:04,744 --> 01:28:06,446
Hi.

2627
01:28:06,447 --> 01:28:08,081
That's the only way to kill us.

2628
01:28:08,082 --> 01:28:09,618
Severe trauma to the dick.

2629
01:28:10,618 --> 01:28:11,750
That's where our brains are.

2630
01:28:11,751 --> 01:28:13,184
Like all guys.
Am I right?

2631
01:28:13,185 --> 01:28:14,285
JAMARCUS:
You know it.

2632
01:28:14,286 --> 01:28:15,288
EVAN:
Bob, come in.

2633
01:28:15,289 --> 01:28:17,288
If you can hear me...

2634
01:28:15,288 --> 01:28:17,322
(yells)

2635
01:28:17,323 --> 01:28:18,589
their weakness is their dick.

2636
01:28:18,590 --> 01:28:20,195
Their Achilles' heel
is in their dicks.

2637
01:28:22,195 --> 01:28:23,399
Die!

2638
01:28:26,399 --> 01:28:27,337
(screeches)

2639
01:28:29,337 --> 01:28:31,069
(screaming)

2640
01:28:31,070 --> 01:28:32,578
(grunts)

2641
01:28:37,578 --> 01:28:40,315
(Bob panting)

2642
01:28:42,315 --> 01:28:44,451
Magnum, my ass.

2643
01:28:44,452 --> 01:28:46,055
I only needed one hand
for that shit.

2644
01:28:48,055 --> 01:28:49,154
(whirring)

2645
01:28:49,155 --> 01:28:51,457
Jamarcus, how do you
shut this thing down?

2646
01:28:51,458 --> 01:28:54,027
Looks like the orb's
powering it,

2647
01:28:54,028 --> 01:28:56,196
so maybe removing the orb

2648
01:28:56,197 --> 01:28:57,262
would de-power it?

2649
01:28:57,263 --> 01:28:58,496
You're guessing?

2650
01:28:58,497 --> 01:28:59,865
You seriously don't know
how this thing works?

2651
01:28:59,866 --> 01:29:01,098
I'm not an engineer.
I didn't build it.

2652
01:29:01,099 --> 01:29:02,836
I mean, do you know
how your cell phone works?

2653
01:29:02,837 --> 01:29:05,170
Do I... Yes, I know
how my cell phone works.

2654
01:29:05,171 --> 01:29:06,772
You hit a bunch of numbers
and you hit send.

2655
01:29:06,773 --> 01:29:08,206
At least don't you know
the basic...?

2656
01:29:08,207 --> 01:29:09,275
What do you mean, the basic?

2657
01:29:09,276 --> 01:29:10,377
Look at it.
It's not fucking basic.

2658
01:29:10,378 --> 01:29:13,779
It looks complicated.
That light bit.

2659
01:29:13,780 --> 01:29:16,082
See, that light... that means
it's almost charged, right?

2660
01:29:16,083 --> 01:29:17,884
What's happening?

2661
01:29:17,885 --> 01:29:19,852
Whoa! What the fuck
is he doing here?

2662
01:29:19,853 --> 01:29:21,085
Bob, it's all right.

Oh, no.
Your husband's dead, isn't he?

Ah, forget it, man.

2765
01:34:33,868 --> 01:34:36,803
I'm really sorry about the stuff
I said, too, but...

2766
01:34:36,804 --> 01:34:38,737
I mean, that's what brothers do.

2767
01:34:38,738 --> 01:34:40,908
They fight.

2768
01:34:41,908 --> 01:34:43,645
But then they always
make up, right?

2769

That was really
beautiful, you guys.

Apologize to me.

2778

For what?

2779
01:35:03,997 --> 01:35:06,332
If I have to tell you,
then the apology is meaningless.

2780
01:35:06,333 --> 01:35:07,966
All right, Frank 'n' Beans.

2781

# Then I let the Alpine play,
play #

2841
01:37:03,115 --> 01:37:05,115
(horn honking)

2842
01:37:03,115 --> 01:37:05,318
# Bumping new shit by N.W.A. #

2843
01:37:05,319 --> 01:37:07,720
# It was gangsta, gangsta
at the top of the list #

2844
01:37:07,721 --> 01:37:11,090
# Then I played my own shit,
it went somethin' like this #

2845
01:37:11,091 --> 01:37:13,759
# Cruisin' down the street
in my 6-4 #

2846
01:37:13,760 --> 01:37:16,228
# Jockin' the bitches,
slappin' the hoes #

2847
01:37:16,229 --> 01:37:18,797
# Went to the park
to get the scoop #

2848
01:37:18,798 --> 01:37:21,533
# Knuckleheads out there
cold shootin' some hoops #

2849
01:37:21,534 --> 01:37:24,435
# A car pulls up,
who can it be? #

2850
01:37:24,436 --> 01:37:27,340
# A fresh El Camino
rolling Kilo G #

2851
01:37:27,341 --> 01:37:30,276
# He rolled down his window
and he started to say #

2852
01:37:30,277 --> 01:37:32,510
# It's all about making
that GTA #

2853
01:37:32,511 --> 01:37:35,380
# 'Cause the boys in the hood
are always hard #

2854
01:37:35,381 --> 01:37:37,783
# You come talkin' that trash,
we'll pull your card #

2855
01:37:37,784 --> 01:37:40,620
# Knowin' nothin' in life
but to be legit #

2856
01:37:40,621 --> 01:37:44,422
# Don't quote me, boy,
'cause I ain't said shit #

2857
01:37:44,423 --> 01:37:45,725
# Yo, man, yo #

2858
01:37:46,725 --> 01:37:49,127
# Yo, man... #

2859
01:37:49,128 --> 01:37:50,429
# Yo, man #

2860
01:37:50,430 --> 01:37:54,666
# Get the fuck out, fuck out,
fuck out, fuck out... #

2861
01:37:54,667 --> 01:37:56,669
(music fades)
