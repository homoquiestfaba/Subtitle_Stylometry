1
00:00:28,066 --> 00:00:29,767
And please, be warned.

2
00:00:29,768 --> 00:00:33,228
If you fidget,
if you look away.

3
00:00:33,968 --> 00:00:36,518
If you forget any part
of what I'll tell you.

4
00:00:37,178 --> 00:00:38,878
Even for an instant.

5
00:00:41,028 --> 00:00:43,418
Then our hero will surely perish.

6
00:01:23,578 --> 00:01:25,418
His name is Kubo.

7
00:01:26,218 --> 00:01:28,558
His grandfather stole
something from him.

8
00:01:39,088 --> 00:01:41,068
That really is the least of it.

9
00:01:42,178 --> 00:01:49,178
KUBO AND TWO STRINGS

10
00:01:51,732 --> 00:01:55,723
Subtitle by Bambula

11
00:06:11,358 --> 00:06:13,398
Well, hello, Kubo.

12
00:06:13,918 --> 00:06:16,948
How was the day?
-It wasn't the bad crowd.

13
00:06:17,128 --> 00:06:21,188
I got two pennies and limp ball.
This is pretty good limp.

14
00:06:21,928 --> 00:06:25,527
A what have you got planned
for today? -You know, usual.

15
00:06:25,528 --> 00:06:27,327
Monsters?
-Of course.

16
00:06:27,328 --> 00:06:29,598
You think you can work
a fire-breathing chicken?

17
00:06:30,308 --> 00:06:33,138
The chicken again?
-The chicken is funny.

18
00:06:33,538 --> 00:06:35,978
A touch of comedy that
balance the whole thing out.

19
00:06:36,418 --> 00:06:39,598
They gonna be throwing money at you,
I just know it.

20
00:06:39,798 --> 00:06:44,297
Or they'll throw something at you,
I don't know. -Okay, I'll see what I can do.

21
00:06:44,298 --> 00:06:47,898
And do you plan on finishing
the story this time, young man?

22
00:06:59,278 --> 00:07:01,678
If you must blink,
do it now.

23
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:09,124
Yeah!

24
00:07:11,418 --> 00:07:14,867
Pay careful attention to everything
you see and hear.

25
00:07:14,868 --> 00:07:17,078
No matter how unusual may it seem.

26
00:07:17,438 --> 00:07:21,868
And please be warned.
If you fidget, if you look away.

27
00:07:21,968 --> 00:07:24,548
If you forget any part
of what I'll tell you.

28
00:07:24,568 --> 00:07:26,268
Even for an instant.

29
00:07:26,658 --> 00:07:29,658
Then our hero will surely perish.

30
00:07:35,568 --> 00:07:38,998
Hanzo was a mighty samurai,
but he was alone.

31
00:07:39,268 --> 00:07:43,167
His family taken from him,
his kingdom in ruins,

32
00:07:43,168 --> 00:07:46,658
his army destroyed by
the dreaded Moon King.

33
00:07:47,268 --> 00:07:50,967
You may recall, Hanzo was
roaming in the distant Far Lands,

34
00:07:50,968 --> 00:07:55,317
in search of a magical suit of armour,
the only weapon in the whole world

35
00:07:55,318 --> 00:07:57,958
that could protect him from powerful
Moon King.

36
00:07:58,338 --> 00:08:00,978
This armour was made
up of three pieces.

37
00:08:01,258 --> 00:08:04,798
First. -I know, I know.
The Sword Unbreakable.

38
00:08:09,898 --> 00:08:13,698
The second.
-The Breastplate Impene...

39
00:08:13,978 --> 00:08:17,538
Impenetrable.
-Impenetrabubble. Yeah!

40
00:08:20,708 --> 00:08:24,657
And finally, the third weapon.
Final piece of the armour.

41
00:08:24,658 --> 00:08:26,767
I know this one.
Pick me.

42
00:08:26,768 --> 00:08:29,118
The Helmet Invulnerable.

43
00:08:31,818 --> 00:08:33,937
Before Hanzo could claim the armour,

44
00:08:33,938 --> 00:08:36,708
and unite pieces to
reveal their true power,

45
00:08:37,208 --> 00:08:39,878
he was attacked by Moon King's beasts.

46
00:09:12,178 --> 00:09:13,878
Yes!

47
00:09:32,658 --> 00:09:35,648
Kill the chicken!
Rip it to pieces!

48
00:10:04,258 --> 00:10:05,958
Oh, my.

49
00:10:24,728 --> 00:10:26,858
Hanzo was filled with rage.

50
00:10:27,288 --> 00:10:31,138
His soul tormenting by the grief
of a family stolen from him.

51
00:10:37,008 --> 00:10:41,017
At last, our hero was face to face
with his nemesis,

52
00:10:41,018 --> 00:10:42,718
the Moon King.

53
00:10:54,448 --> 00:10:57,088
Be sure to come back tomorrow.
-Again?

54
00:10:57,208 --> 00:11:01,887
What? Come on!
People like the ending.

55
00:11:01,888 --> 00:11:03,747
Where are you going?

56
00:11:03,748 --> 00:11:06,528
No, you can't...
You can't leave!

57
00:11:24,468 --> 00:11:26,168
Kubo?

58
00:11:27,098 --> 00:11:30,918
Kubo?
-Yes, mother? I'm here.

59
00:11:33,408 --> 00:11:35,108
Hungry?

60
00:11:36,158 --> 00:11:41,378
And even though he could barely see
his own hand in front of his face,

61
00:11:41,768 --> 00:11:46,418
Hanzo and his army of loyal samurai
pressed on through the blizzard.

62
00:11:50,058 --> 00:11:56,128
And suddenly, as quickly as it started,
the storm cleared before him.

63
00:11:56,518 --> 00:12:00,797
Hanzo breathed a sigh of relief,
for he is home.

64
00:12:00,798 --> 00:12:05,598
His fortress? The Beetle Clan castle?
-Yes, at the very edge of the Far Lands.

65
00:12:06,008 --> 00:12:09,018
Hidden from the Moon King by
powerful magic.

66
00:12:09,528 --> 00:12:12,038
Then what happened?
When he got to the castle?

67
00:12:13,828 --> 00:12:16,678
When who got to the castle?
-Hanzo, my father.

68
00:12:17,288 --> 00:12:21,868
Hanzo? Hanzo was at the castle?
He...

69
00:12:23,158 --> 00:12:24,878
Just give me a second, I'm...

70
00:12:25,908 --> 00:12:29,168
No. It's gone.

71
00:12:30,328 --> 00:12:34,298
I can't. I'm sorry, Kubo.

72
00:12:35,058 --> 00:12:37,788
Perhaps I could recall
a different story.

73
00:12:38,548 --> 00:12:42,138
Mother, what was father like?

74
00:12:44,958 --> 00:12:46,658
This one is easy.

75
00:12:47,188 --> 00:12:51,607
Hanzo was a mighty warrior,
skilled with sword and bow.

76
00:12:51,608 --> 00:12:56,198
No. What was he really like?
When he wasn't fighting.

77
00:12:57,008 --> 00:12:58,708
When he was with us.

78
00:13:00,638 --> 00:13:02,338
He was just like you.

79
00:13:03,608 --> 00:13:05,497
Like me?
-Yes.

80
00:13:05,498 --> 00:13:11,348
Strong, and clever, and funny.
And, so handsome.

81
00:13:12,018 --> 00:13:14,138
Mother.
-Come on.

82
00:13:15,398 --> 00:13:19,438
Never forget how much
he loved you, Kubo.

83
00:13:19,858 --> 00:13:22,138
He died protecting us.

84
00:13:25,028 --> 00:13:28,018
Did the Moon King...
-Your grandfather.

85
00:13:28,398 --> 00:13:31,378
Did grandfather and your sisters
really kill my father?

86
00:13:31,838 --> 00:13:34,847
It can't be true, can it?
They're family.

87
00:13:34,848 --> 00:13:36,767
No. They are monsters.

88
00:13:36,768 --> 00:13:40,097
Grandfather and my sisters
stole your eye, Kubo.

89
00:13:40,098 --> 00:13:43,317
They must never find you again, never!

90
00:13:43,318 --> 00:13:45,617
You must always stay
hidden from the night sky,

91
00:13:45,618 --> 00:13:48,468
or they'll find you
and they'll take you away from me.

92
00:13:48,688 --> 00:13:53,918
Promise me. You will never let this happen.
Promise me, Kubo.

93
00:13:59,558 --> 00:14:01,798
Don't be sad, Kubo.

94
00:14:02,688 --> 00:14:06,898
Kubo. Remember what you must do, Kubo.

95
00:14:07,928 --> 00:14:09,628
Remember.

96
00:14:10,178 --> 00:14:13,148
Keep you with me all the time,
Mr. Monkey.

97
00:14:13,218 --> 00:14:18,687
And? -And keep father's robe
on my back at all times.

98
00:14:18,688 --> 00:14:22,738
Yes, Kubo.
And there is one more thing.

99
00:14:23,298 --> 00:14:27,738
Never ever stay out after dark.

100
00:14:30,498 --> 00:14:32,748
Remember.

101
00:14:33,698 --> 00:14:37,028
Yes, Mr. Monkey.
-Good boy.

102
00:14:55,538 --> 00:14:57,238
Bed time.

103
00:15:52,518 --> 00:15:54,877
Mother, wake up.
You're dreaming.

104
00:15:54,878 --> 00:15:57,178
No. Kubo.

105
00:15:58,388 --> 00:16:01,338
Kubo, is that you?
-Yes, mother. I'm here.

106
00:16:04,868 --> 00:16:07,678
Kubo, what happened to your eye?

107
00:16:30,098 --> 00:16:33,138
Paper boy!
Here, here!

108
00:16:34,328 --> 00:16:38,288
Come on, come on. Come sit next
to me. I got us a good spot here.

109
00:16:39,298 --> 00:16:43,618
What do you think?
I got myself all gussied up for the big day.

110
00:16:48,298 --> 00:16:52,858
I do so love the festival.
A time to celebrate.

111
00:16:54,338 --> 00:16:57,728
You know, it's a shame
you never stay pass sundown.

112
00:16:57,918 --> 00:17:03,717
There's fireworks,
singing and dancing. And feasting, of course.

113
00:17:03,718 --> 00:17:05,568
But the best part of all...

114
00:17:05,978 --> 00:17:08,138
Do you see those lamps and altars?

115
00:17:08,458 --> 00:17:13,178
We use those to speak to the
loved ones that left us behind.

116
00:17:14,308 --> 00:17:18,607
We listen to their tales
and guide their safe return

117
00:17:18,608 --> 00:17:22,497
to the blissful pure land.
-Really? Did you speak to someone?

118
00:17:22,498 --> 00:17:24,318
Yes, I did.
My husband.

119
00:17:24,618 --> 00:17:30,078
His voice was as clear and loud
as the one you use for your stories.

120
00:17:30,478 --> 00:17:32,967
In 72 years,
he never had a thing to say.

121
00:17:32,968 --> 00:17:35,098
Now he's gone,
I can't shut him up.

122
00:17:39,358 --> 00:17:42,657
You have someone you wanna talk to, huh?
-Very much.

123
00:17:42,658 --> 00:17:45,737
Well, what is stopping you?
-Don't I need a lamp?

124
00:17:45,738 --> 00:17:50,277
Well, I'll bet you can make
a really nice one

125
00:17:50,278 --> 00:17:53,778
with that paper folding
thing you do.

126
00:17:54,768 --> 00:17:57,598
You see? Not just a pretty face, huh?

127
00:17:58,158 --> 00:17:59,897
Now hurry along.

128
00:17:59,898 --> 00:18:04,098
Go, there's still time before dark.
Go, get out of here.

129
00:18:38,518 --> 00:18:40,218
Place the lamp at the altar.

130
00:18:41,578 --> 00:18:44,228
Very good.
-What do we do next, daddy?

131
00:18:44,538 --> 00:18:46,238
Now we pray.

132
00:18:46,298 --> 00:18:49,258
We ask her spirit
to honour us with its light.

133
00:18:49,658 --> 00:18:52,528
Grandma, will you please honour?

134
00:18:53,358 --> 00:18:55,378
Softly, softly.

135
00:19:13,598 --> 00:19:16,598
Hello, father.
I hope you're well.

136
00:19:16,798 --> 00:19:21,758
I mean, I know you're dead,
but I hope everything is okay.

137
00:19:27,138 --> 00:19:28,938
Look, it's your robe.

138
00:19:29,828 --> 00:19:31,528
Mother says I'll grow into it.

139
00:19:33,368 --> 00:19:36,318
She says you're a great leader,
who died protecting me.

140
00:19:37,128 --> 00:19:38,998
Saving one of my eyes.

141
00:19:39,758 --> 00:19:42,828
Two would have been ideal,
but thanks anyway.

142
00:19:46,118 --> 00:19:48,368
Father, I'm worried about mother.

143
00:19:49,058 --> 00:19:52,078
With every day goes by,
she drifts further away.

144
00:19:54,218 --> 00:19:57,888
She talks a lot about you,
but... But I just don't know.

145
00:19:58,728 --> 00:20:00,958
I don't think she remembers
what's real anymore.

146
00:20:02,958 --> 00:20:04,838
I don't know what's real anymore.

147
00:20:05,768 --> 00:20:07,488
I just wish you were here.

148
00:20:08,518 --> 00:20:12,298
So I could talk to you, see you.

149
00:20:13,138 --> 00:20:17,277
Find out what I should do.
-Daddy, daddy, she is here. Grandma is here.

150
00:20:17,278 --> 00:20:19,718
Now it's time for the final part.

151
00:20:19,978 --> 00:20:22,688
We have to help her
to get back to the spirit world.

152
00:20:23,608 --> 00:20:27,308
But she just got here.
-Come on.

153
00:20:28,328 --> 00:20:31,138
Father? Hello?

154
00:20:35,018 --> 00:20:36,718
Any time?

155
00:21:33,484 --> 00:21:35,257
Fine.

156
00:21:35,258 --> 00:21:36,958
I don't need you anyway.

157
00:21:44,338 --> 00:21:46,038
Kubo.

158
00:21:54,148 --> 00:21:55,848
I'm sorry.

159
00:22:04,258 --> 00:22:06,438
Kubo...

160
00:22:12,778 --> 00:22:14,478
Here I am.

161
00:22:14,868 --> 00:22:19,837
Little boy, what happened to your eye?

162
00:22:19,838 --> 00:22:23,018
Who are you?
How do you know my name?

163
00:22:24,138 --> 00:22:28,558
We're your family, Kubo.
Your mother's sisters.

164
00:22:29,278 --> 00:22:33,158
And we've been looking for you
so long.

165
00:22:33,568 --> 00:22:39,978
It's so lovely to meet you, Kubo,
face to face.

166
00:22:43,778 --> 00:22:47,938
Come, Kubo,
come to your aunties.

167
00:22:48,288 --> 00:22:51,318
No reason to be afraid, Kubo.

168
00:22:51,828 --> 00:22:54,288
We just need your other eye.

169
00:22:54,448 --> 00:22:57,488
Your grandfather admires it so.

170
00:23:21,498 --> 00:23:25,818
Help! Help!
Somebody help!

171
00:23:25,988 --> 00:23:28,938
Help! Look out!
Run!

172
00:23:35,298 --> 00:23:36,998
Run!

173
00:23:39,898 --> 00:23:41,598
Mother!

174
00:23:53,898 --> 00:23:55,778
We're here, Kubo.

175
00:23:56,738 --> 00:23:58,878
Your family has come for you.

176
00:24:11,958 --> 00:24:14,158
Kubo.
-Mother.

177
00:24:21,928 --> 00:24:25,838
Kubo, you must find the armour.
It's your only chance.

178
00:24:26,138 --> 00:24:27,838
Remember this.

179
00:24:34,658 --> 00:24:36,358
Mother!

180
00:24:36,978 --> 00:24:38,678
Mother!

181
00:24:38,718 --> 00:24:40,418
No!

182
00:24:41,348 --> 00:24:43,048
Mother!

183
00:24:59,298 --> 00:25:00,998
Kubo.

184
00:25:02,438 --> 00:25:04,828
Can you hear me, Kubo?

185
00:25:09,418 --> 00:25:11,787
I said your mother is gone.

186
00:25:11,788 --> 00:25:14,958
Your village is destroyed,
burnt to the ground.

187
00:25:16,038 --> 00:25:17,998
We landed here
in the Far lands.

188
00:25:18,298 --> 00:25:20,318
Your enemies aren't far behind.

189
00:25:20,608 --> 00:25:24,048
We must search for shelter
before your grandfather comes.

190
00:25:30,068 --> 00:25:31,768
We need to go now.

191
00:25:33,858 --> 00:25:35,778
Come on, get up!
Let's go!

192
00:26:13,138 --> 00:26:18,118
Once we're inside, you might be
tempted to complain about the odour.

193
00:26:22,538 --> 00:26:27,148
Keep in mind my sense of smell
is ten times stronger than yours.

194
00:27:05,218 --> 00:27:06,968
You have questions, I can tell.

195
00:27:07,248 --> 00:27:08,948
Who...
-You get three.

196
00:27:10,458 --> 00:27:12,238
I think I have more.

197
00:27:12,688 --> 00:27:16,843
Three, before you gonna eat.
-Why only three?

198
00:27:16,848 --> 00:27:18,591
Okay, that was your first question.
-What?

199
00:27:18,626 --> 00:27:21,748
I don't understand what's happening.
Who are you?

200
00:27:22,798 --> 00:27:24,498
You don't recognize me?

201
00:27:28,498 --> 00:27:32,467
All these years, you had to keep me
in your pack. Now you know why.

202
00:27:32,468 --> 00:27:36,558
But you were a wooden charm.
You were this big.

203
00:27:37,518 --> 00:27:40,537
I called that charm Mr. Monkey.

204
00:27:40,538 --> 00:27:43,667
And if I were alive at that point,
I might have found it insulting.

205
00:27:43,668 --> 00:27:47,497
Look, your mother used last of her magic
to save you.

206
00:27:47,498 --> 00:27:49,198
And bring me to life.

207
00:28:00,038 --> 00:28:01,738
Here. Drink.

208
00:28:06,038 --> 00:28:08,548
It smells.
-Everything in here smells.

209
00:28:09,078 --> 00:28:12,817
Drink it. -I don't want it.
-I said, drink it.

210
00:28:12,818 --> 00:28:16,377
You are a mean monkey, aren't you?
-Yes. Yes, I am.

211
00:28:16,378 --> 00:28:18,938
And that's three.
You're out of questions. Now just listen.

212
00:28:19,298 --> 00:28:23,308
I am here to protect you, Kubo.
And that means you have to do as I say.

213
00:28:23,578 --> 00:28:27,807
So, if you don't eat, you'll be weak.
If you're weak, you'll be slow.

214
00:28:27,808 --> 00:28:29,508
If you're slow, you'll die.

215
00:28:35,128 --> 00:28:36,828
It's too hot.

216
00:28:42,758 --> 00:28:44,458
Drink.

217
00:28:53,478 --> 00:28:55,178
Excuse me.

218
00:29:08,058 --> 00:29:10,797
Okay, you better start
taking this seriously, Kubo.

219
00:29:10,798 --> 00:29:13,667
This is real. This is not a story.

220
00:29:13,668 --> 00:29:15,817
Those things, your aunts.

221
00:29:15,818 --> 00:29:18,707
They never get hungry.
They never sleep.

222
00:29:18,708 --> 00:29:20,408
They will find you.

223
00:29:21,298 --> 00:29:22,998
And if we're not prepared...

224
00:29:23,728 --> 00:29:27,088
They'll kill me
and take your other eye.

225
00:29:31,178 --> 00:29:34,141
What are we gonna do?
-We're going to find the armour.

226
00:29:35,055 --> 00:29:36,930
It's the only thing that can protect you.

227
00:29:37,718 --> 00:29:41,088
So it's real.
Really real.

228
00:29:53,188 --> 00:29:55,588
Don't worry, I am not going to keep it.

229
00:29:57,608 --> 00:30:01,548
I pulled that from her head.
I didn't mean to.

230
00:30:01,728 --> 00:30:03,888
Your mother was very powerful.

231
00:30:04,278 --> 00:30:08,838
She blessed your robes so when the
need was most they would fly you away.

232
00:30:09,248 --> 00:30:12,418
She used the last of that power
to bring me to life.

233
00:30:12,818 --> 00:30:15,938
This bracelet,
her hair, it's a memory.

234
00:30:16,148 --> 00:30:18,378
And memories are
powerful things, Kubo.

235
00:30:19,088 --> 00:30:20,788
Never lose it.

236
00:30:25,448 --> 00:30:28,318
One more question?
-Last one.

237
00:30:28,708 --> 00:30:31,478
Do you know where it is?
The armour?

238
00:30:32,538 --> 00:30:34,948
No. No, I don't.

239
00:30:39,518 --> 00:30:41,218
Now go to sleep.

240
00:30:49,448 --> 00:30:51,148
Good night, Monkey.

241
00:31:09,038 --> 00:31:10,738
Kubo.

242
00:31:11,128 --> 00:31:14,418
Kubo!
You were talking in your sleep.

243
00:31:14,918 --> 00:31:18,158
You were dreaming,
calling out to your father.

244
00:31:18,658 --> 00:31:23,958
And then the paper flew out
of your bag and folded itself into him.

245
00:31:26,678 --> 00:31:31,728
He's been standing there for hours.
Quietly judging us.

246
00:31:35,828 --> 00:31:38,378
I am not even convinced
that this counts as origami.

247
00:31:39,918 --> 00:31:42,878
I could swear scissors were involved.

248
00:31:45,078 --> 00:31:48,628
Back home in the cave,
my mother's dreams did this,

249
00:31:48,868 --> 00:31:52,108
and the paper always unfolded itself
by morning.

250
00:32:02,628 --> 00:32:04,328
What's that about?

251
00:32:18,758 --> 00:32:20,458
What are you doing?

252
00:32:25,648 --> 00:32:27,858
I guess this is how
my father answered me.

253
00:32:29,168 --> 00:32:31,627
I am tempted to say
that entrusting our fate

254
00:32:31,661 --> 00:32:36,678
to the guidance of the small
paper man seems like a bad idea.

255
00:32:37,218 --> 00:32:39,988
But that's the best bad idea we have.

256
00:34:10,298 --> 00:34:11,998
You're growing stronger.

257
00:34:11,999 --> 00:34:14,928
You might not want look
quite so pleased about that.

258
00:34:14,938 --> 00:34:18,497
We grow stronger,
the world grows more dangerous.

259
00:34:18,498 --> 00:34:21,036
Life has a funny way
of keeping things balanced.

260
00:34:21,037 --> 00:34:24,338
Monkey, do you ever say anything
encouraging?

261
00:34:25,748 --> 00:34:27,648
I encourage you not to die.

262
00:34:35,888 --> 00:34:37,738
"I encourage you not to die."

263
00:34:58,948 --> 00:35:01,508
Mosquitoes, annoying.

264
00:35:24,968 --> 00:35:26,668
It wasn't me, I swear.

265
00:35:28,768 --> 00:35:31,557
Paper runs out,
as does patience.

266
00:35:31,558 --> 00:35:33,258
I didn't ask them to do that.

267
00:35:34,918 --> 00:35:38,018
The second time.
I didn't!

268
00:35:38,528 --> 00:35:41,437
At least not exactly.
I mean, I felt it, but...

269
00:35:41,438 --> 00:35:45,377
Magic is not meant to be easy.
You need to learn control.

270
00:35:45,378 --> 00:35:49,057
Concentrate on what you're doing,
and always remember.

271
00:35:49,058 --> 00:35:51,418
Don't mess with the Monkey.

272
00:36:07,078 --> 00:36:10,458
Tread carefully, Kubo.
This isn't one of your stories.

273
00:36:10,798 --> 00:36:12,697
How do you know? Maybe it is.

274
00:36:12,698 --> 00:36:15,898
I'm a valiant hero
and you're the mean monkey.

275
00:36:15,908 --> 00:36:17,677
Heroes come and go.

276
00:36:17,678 --> 00:36:21,058
Any moment something terrible
could come out of nowhere and...

277
00:36:22,078 --> 00:36:24,758
Monkey!
-Kubo!

278
00:36:37,618 --> 00:36:39,318
Monkey, wait!

279
00:36:40,308 --> 00:36:42,008
He wasn't trying to hurt me.

280
00:36:42,998 --> 00:36:45,728
He just wanted Hanzo.
-Hanzo?

281
00:36:47,588 --> 00:36:49,288
Hanzo.

282
00:36:53,718 --> 00:36:55,607
I still think I'm gonna stab him.

283
00:36:55,640 --> 00:36:58,167
Why must you always assume
the worst?

284
00:36:58,168 --> 00:37:01,377
Pardon me for not trusting this
giant spiky insect monster

285
00:37:01,378 --> 00:37:04,798
that just kidnapped you.
-Hanzo, yes. I remember him.

286
00:37:05,288 --> 00:37:08,238
I think maybe he was my master.

287
00:37:08,448 --> 00:37:10,148
What? What did you say?

288
00:37:11,418 --> 00:37:13,778
We had a crest, a samurai crest.

289
00:37:21,528 --> 00:37:23,468
Have you seen this crest before?

290
00:37:27,888 --> 00:37:29,888
This is a miracle.

291
00:37:30,578 --> 00:37:35,018
You have our robes.
You're wearing our robes!

292
00:37:35,578 --> 00:37:37,322
Why are you wearing our robes?

293
00:37:37,323 --> 00:37:40,200
He doesn't have to answer to your
questions. Anyway, who are you?

294
00:37:42,468 --> 00:37:44,838
Many years ago I was cursed.

295
00:37:45,498 --> 00:37:48,108
Trapped in this cursed state.

296
00:37:49,278 --> 00:37:51,628
Cursed to wander the Far Lands.

297
00:37:52,168 --> 00:37:54,548
Cursed or cursed.

298
00:37:55,248 --> 00:37:57,588
No comrades, no master.

299
00:37:58,078 --> 00:38:03,758
Not even a name or a single memory
of the noble warrior I once was.

300
00:38:03,958 --> 00:38:09,148
You used to be a man?
-No, not just any man. A samurai.

301
00:38:09,827 --> 00:38:13,887
I mean, I'm pretty certain.
Look, I have the staff.

302
00:38:13,888 --> 00:38:16,177
I mean, I'm either a samurai
or really bad hoarder.

303
00:38:16,178 --> 00:38:20,127
Either way, inside my thorax
beats the heart of a warrior.

304
00:38:20,128 --> 00:38:24,677
If you have no memory,
how can you be certain of anything?

305
00:38:24,678 --> 00:38:26,848
Because I get flashes.

306
00:38:27,108 --> 00:38:30,988
They come about from objects I find
on my travel.

307
00:38:32,018 --> 00:38:36,258
Sometimes, it's a sound
or a smell.

308
00:38:37,318 --> 00:38:39,468
You must get a lot of flashes.
-Memories.

309
00:38:39,838 --> 00:38:43,074
They fade. And all I'm left
with is the sense that I was

310
00:38:43,075 --> 00:38:45,861
once part of something much greater.

311
00:38:46,288 --> 00:38:49,287
Monkey, can I tell him?
-I really don't think it's a good idea.

312
00:38:49,288 --> 00:38:52,897
He has a right. -Absolutely not.
-But... -No but! -I... -No!

313
00:38:52,898 --> 00:38:56,108
What tell me, what?
-Hanzo was my Father. -Kubo!

314
00:38:56,798 --> 00:38:58,498
This is a miracle.

315
00:38:58,778 --> 00:39:00,878
I have found the son of my master.

316
00:39:03,258 --> 00:39:05,568
Don't even...

317
00:39:06,218 --> 00:39:09,507
Whatever brings you to these lands,
whatever your quest,

318
00:39:09,508 --> 00:39:11,817
it is now my quest too.

319
00:39:11,818 --> 00:39:15,908
I will join you and I'll give my life for you
if necessary.

320
00:39:16,378 --> 00:39:18,198
Wow. You will?

321
00:39:18,728 --> 00:39:21,182
What? Do you think that's possible?

322
00:39:21,183 --> 00:39:23,587
I mean, I know how these quests go.

323
00:39:23,588 --> 00:39:26,068
People die all the time,
they drop like flies.

324
00:39:26,368 --> 00:39:31,767
That doesn't matter.
Because I have a feeling this is my destiny.

325
00:39:31,768 --> 00:39:35,137
No, it isn't.
We can't trust anything you say,

326
00:39:35,138 --> 00:39:37,877
because you can't
trust anything you say.

327
00:39:37,878 --> 00:39:39,938
We don't know anything about you.

328
00:39:41,008 --> 00:39:45,248
Monkey, you said it yourself.
Our quest is a difficult one.

329
00:39:45,668 --> 00:39:50,797
A samurai, even a cursed one,
with no memories, and looks like a bug,

330
00:39:50,798 --> 00:39:54,358
could be helpful.
-Yes, I'm certain that I can be helpful.

331
00:39:54,568 --> 00:39:57,778
Indispensable.
-In what way?

332
00:40:06,048 --> 00:40:09,628
Firing an arrow into a wall
is hardly what I call...

333
00:40:12,878 --> 00:40:16,468
Impressive. -Look at that.
Literally the first time I've ever done it.

334
00:40:16,778 --> 00:40:18,527
Just tell me of our quest.

335
00:40:18,528 --> 00:40:22,868
And I will quickly demonstrate
my numerous indispensabilities.

336
00:40:23,198 --> 00:40:25,887
Well, that's kind of a long story.

337
00:40:25,888 --> 00:40:28,807
You got my attention.
I promise I won't even blink.

338
00:40:28,808 --> 00:40:31,807
Actually I don't think I even can blink.
Do I have eye lids?

339
00:40:31,808 --> 00:40:34,878
Fine. Walk and talk.
Hanzo has found the path.

340
00:40:56,578 --> 00:41:00,017
So you used to be a toy monkey.

341
00:41:00,018 --> 00:41:03,427
Kubo, I really don't see
how this part is important to our story.

342
00:41:03,428 --> 00:41:07,567
I kept her in my pocket,
she was only this big.

343
00:41:07,568 --> 00:41:10,787
Okay, Kubo, that's enough.
-Tiny. And she was called Mr. Monkey.

344
00:41:10,788 --> 00:41:13,728
I wasn't a toy.
I was a charm.

345
00:41:14,328 --> 00:41:16,028
Of course you were.

346
00:41:37,568 --> 00:41:39,268
That doesn't look good.

347
00:41:41,428 --> 00:41:43,128
Don't touch anything.

348
00:41:50,368 --> 00:41:52,068
He did it.

349
00:42:11,448 --> 00:42:13,148
Okay.

350
00:42:21,738 --> 00:42:23,438
No. No. No.

351
00:42:27,988 --> 00:42:29,688
Yes.

352
00:42:31,828 --> 00:42:33,718
Kubo, look.

353
00:42:38,918 --> 00:42:40,618
The Sword Unbreakable.

354
00:42:41,368 --> 00:42:43,068
It could be a trap.

355
00:42:43,668 --> 00:42:45,368
Allow me.

356
00:42:45,518 --> 00:42:47,778
What, it's not a trap
if you do it?

357
00:42:47,968 --> 00:42:50,198
Stealth is my middle name.

358
00:42:52,488 --> 00:42:54,278
You don't even have a first name.

359
00:42:54,538 --> 00:42:56,578
Don't worry, I got this.

360
00:43:03,608 --> 00:43:06,308
The mighty Beetle is victorious!

361
00:43:34,678 --> 00:43:36,459
I got...
I don't got this.

362
00:43:36,470 --> 00:43:42,168
I don't got this! -For crying out loud!
I invoke the Sword Unbreakable!

363
00:43:44,948 --> 00:43:49,117
It broke.
-So, does it just mean the handle or...

364
00:43:49,118 --> 00:43:51,327
I am little disappointed
with this magic sword.

365
00:43:51,328 --> 00:43:54,078
It's not the right sword, you idiot!

366
00:43:59,738 --> 00:44:01,438
Look!

367
00:44:01,498 --> 00:44:03,788
The sword! It's in his head!

368
00:44:04,388 --> 00:44:07,298
Hey, I've got a bone to pick with you.

369
00:44:07,608 --> 00:44:10,048
See? Because he is made of bones.

370
00:44:10,648 --> 00:44:12,348
You are an embarrassment.

371
00:44:15,328 --> 00:44:17,028
This is problematic.

372
00:44:25,688 --> 00:44:27,818
Enough with the arrows!

373
00:45:01,078 --> 00:45:02,778
Foot!

374
00:45:05,918 --> 00:45:09,018
You can fly?
-Apparently. Yes.

375
00:45:29,988 --> 00:45:31,688
Come on!

376
00:45:34,758 --> 00:45:37,478
Are you sure it isn't
the Sword Unfindable?

377
00:45:42,398 --> 00:45:44,098
I think I found it.

378
00:45:46,288 --> 00:45:48,618
Hand here? Anyone?

379
00:45:50,068 --> 00:45:51,768
Anyone else?

380
00:45:55,458 --> 00:45:57,158
Kubo!

381
00:46:10,948 --> 00:46:12,858
Kubo!
-Monkey!

382
00:46:15,328 --> 00:46:17,028
No!
-Kubo!

383
00:46:32,548 --> 00:46:34,248
Yes!

384
00:46:35,828 --> 00:46:37,528
Thank goodness that's over.

385
00:46:53,578 --> 00:46:56,947
Everything turning black.

386
00:46:56,948 --> 00:46:58,648
Then open your eyes.

387
00:47:01,568 --> 00:47:05,237
I can't feel my wings. -You didn't
even know you had them 5 minutes ago.

388
00:47:05,238 --> 00:47:06,938
Stop wriggling.

389
00:47:07,028 --> 00:47:10,168
Here, is that feeling better?
-Oh, yeah. Little to the left.

390
00:47:10,838 --> 00:47:15,158
Down just a bit.
Right there, that's good.

391
00:47:15,988 --> 00:47:18,198
Wait. You're being nice to me.

392
00:47:18,768 --> 00:47:20,818
Don't tell anyone.
-We did it, Beetle.

393
00:47:21,078 --> 00:47:22,778
We got the sword.

394
00:47:27,478 --> 00:47:29,638
Put that down. It's sharp.

395
00:47:38,968 --> 00:47:42,518
Okay. We are done here.
Get up.

396
00:47:42,978 --> 00:47:45,907
We have a lot of walking to do.
-You can't be serious?

397
00:47:45,908 --> 00:47:47,708
I'm always serious.

398
00:47:48,128 --> 00:47:50,377
Are you two going to fight again?

399
00:47:50,378 --> 00:47:53,137
Of course not.
We're having a grown-up conversation.

400
00:47:53,138 --> 00:47:55,660
You're going to fight again.
-Kubo, just go over there

401
00:47:55,661 --> 00:47:57,760
and play with something.
-Not that.

402
00:47:58,368 --> 00:48:01,788
Monkey, this is the Long Lake.

403
00:48:01,958 --> 00:48:05,738
We can't walk around it.
We need to swim across.

404
00:48:06,018 --> 00:48:10,147
I can carry Kubo. -Carry Kubo?
That's your better idea?

405
00:48:10,148 --> 00:48:12,697
Look, I appreciate your help,
I really do.

406
00:48:12,698 --> 00:48:15,077
But when comes to the boy,
I know what's best.

407
00:48:15,078 --> 00:48:19,527
Is that right? -And what's best is not to be
fielding ideas from a talking cockroach.

408
00:48:19,528 --> 00:48:22,767
This coming from a talking monkey.
-I still hear you, you know.

409
00:48:22,768 --> 00:48:24,708
Then play louder.

410
00:48:24,978 --> 00:48:27,257
This conversation is over.
Monkeys don't swim.

411
00:48:27,258 --> 00:48:30,158
Not to worry, monkey see,
monkey do.

412
00:48:30,538 --> 00:48:33,588
How long have you been waiting to say that?
-Ever since I met you.

413
00:48:33,848 --> 00:48:35,788
What were we grown-up
conversationing about?

414
00:48:36,378 --> 00:48:40,217
You're ridiculous. You're just
absolutely ridiculous. Ridiculous!

415
00:48:40,218 --> 00:48:43,507
Crossing the lake is a ridiculous idea!

416
00:48:43,508 --> 00:48:46,577
It's not your fault,
there's no sense left in your head.

417
00:48:46,578 --> 00:48:51,477
I think I resent that. I may not know
everything. -Anything. -Anything.

418
00:48:51,478 --> 00:48:55,107
But I do know Kubo is more capable
than you think he is.

419
00:48:55,108 --> 00:48:59,717
You're being a tiny bit overprotective here.
-I'm being a lot overprotective here.

420
00:48:59,718 --> 00:49:01,777
It's my job to make sure Kubo is safe.

421
00:49:01,778 --> 00:49:05,717
And that is not safe.
You, you're not safe.

422
00:49:05,718 --> 00:49:09,287
Kubo's just a child.
-And incredibly gifted one.

423
00:49:09,288 --> 00:49:12,147
He just saved our lives.
-Yes, he's very powerful,

424
00:49:12,148 --> 00:49:14,988
but he still has much to learn.

425
00:49:15,778 --> 00:49:17,478
What?

426
00:49:21,508 --> 00:49:23,338
Fast learner.

427
00:49:27,958 --> 00:49:29,658
Did you know you can do that?

428
00:49:38,638 --> 00:49:40,338
Show-off.

429
00:50:00,788 --> 00:50:03,548
Okay. Now take a deep breath.

430
00:50:05,258 --> 00:50:07,238
Clear your mind.

431
00:50:07,658 --> 00:50:09,358
I guess I got that part covered.

432
00:50:09,838 --> 00:50:15,178
Now draw back slowly.
That's it. Close one eye.

433
00:50:15,538 --> 00:50:17,238
Guess you got that part covered.

434
00:50:17,858 --> 00:50:23,567
Concentrate on what is directly in front
of you that everything else fall away.

435
00:50:23,568 --> 00:50:26,598
And release.

436
00:50:29,048 --> 00:50:31,837
Perfect shot. Perfect shot.

437
00:50:31,838 --> 00:50:36,578
Not bad. And what's your plan for getting the
fish into the boat so we can actually eat it?

438
00:50:41,478 --> 00:50:45,487
Well, I said I was teaching him
how to shoot, not fish.

439
00:50:45,488 --> 00:50:47,958
Fishing is tomorrow's lesson.

440
00:50:48,328 --> 00:50:50,028
Give me that.

441
00:50:50,208 --> 00:50:51,908
Grabby monkey.

442
00:50:54,008 --> 00:50:55,708
Now try it.

443
00:50:57,438 --> 00:50:59,568
Pull back and...

444
00:51:04,248 --> 00:51:06,998
Rope, it's pretty good idea.

445
00:51:07,668 --> 00:51:09,468
And you're not an awful shot.

446
00:51:12,688 --> 00:51:14,918
Okay, now you two are being weird.

447
00:51:18,158 --> 00:51:20,658
We're going to need something
to cut this with.

448
00:51:30,158 --> 00:51:31,858
Sword Unbreakable.

449
00:51:50,568 --> 00:51:52,718
Must you play with your food?

450
00:51:55,658 --> 00:51:57,358
Yes.

451
00:52:00,868 --> 00:52:02,618
What's the matter, Kubo?

452
00:52:02,653 --> 00:52:07,238
You act like you've never had a meal
sitting between monkey and beetle before.

453
00:52:08,208 --> 00:52:11,417
I've never had a meal
sitting between anyone before.

454
00:52:11,418 --> 00:52:15,578
Come on, eat. You need energy. And
this is much better than whale soup.

455
00:52:15,908 --> 00:52:17,908
Kubo, question.

456
00:52:18,928 --> 00:52:23,118
Before you started on your heroic quest,
what were you like?

457
00:52:24,168 --> 00:52:29,138
Well, I looked after my mother mostly.
And I told stories.

458
00:52:29,748 --> 00:52:32,472
About mighty warriors
seeking revenge,

459
00:52:32,473 --> 00:52:34,890
with battles, and monsters,
and magic.

460
00:52:35,528 --> 00:52:37,228
I was pretty good at telling them.

461
00:52:38,448 --> 00:52:40,678
Not so good at ending them.

462
00:52:40,708 --> 00:52:44,388
Sometimes I would tell my mother stories
about little things,

463
00:52:44,598 --> 00:52:50,178
like skimming rocks across the river,
or catching fireflies in the mulberry fields.

464
00:52:50,938 --> 00:52:55,018
And when I told those stories,
I could see her eyes for mostly clear.

465
00:52:55,568 --> 00:52:59,378
I could tell she saw me.
Really saw me.

466
00:53:00,388 --> 00:53:04,958
I could see her too,
her real self, her spirit

467
00:53:05,668 --> 00:53:07,438
trying to find its way out.

468
00:53:08,948 --> 00:53:10,648
It was beautiful.

469
00:53:15,238 --> 00:53:18,678
You know something, Kubo?
Back when you just told stories,

470
00:53:19,118 --> 00:53:24,258
before you went on this great adventure,
you were still very much hero.

471
00:53:44,138 --> 00:53:47,868
We're gonna have to head for shore,
find a hiding place and...

472
00:53:56,118 --> 00:53:58,948
The second piece of armour.
-The breastplate.

473
00:53:59,978 --> 00:54:02,367
It's down there.
-Okay, I got it.

474
00:54:02,368 --> 00:54:04,817
Beetle, wait.
-No. Don't worry.

475
00:54:04,818 --> 00:54:08,277
Beetles can hold their breath
underwater for a very long time.

476
00:54:08,278 --> 00:54:11,127
What? Since when?
-It's a well-known fact, Monkey.

477
00:54:11,128 --> 00:54:12,877
So you don't remember anything at all,

478
00:54:12,878 --> 00:54:15,427
but beetle swimming,
that's what sticks in there?

479
00:54:15,428 --> 00:54:19,118
No, Beetle. My mother told me
a story about the Long Lake.

480
00:54:19,458 --> 00:54:22,338
There is something under the water.
-Oh, yeah?

481
00:54:24,278 --> 00:54:28,108
What kind of something?
-She said there was a Garden of Eyes.

482
00:54:28,618 --> 00:54:31,648
Eyes that stare into you
and into your soul.

483
00:54:31,918 --> 00:54:33,627
They show you secrets.

484
00:54:33,628 --> 00:54:37,718
Things that keep you down there
with them. Forever.

485
00:54:38,528 --> 00:54:43,078
Okay. Well, I won't look directly
into anyone's eyes.

486
00:54:43,418 --> 00:54:45,658
Even if I'm being incredibly sincere.

487
00:54:47,368 --> 00:54:49,068
You're gonna miss me, Monkey.

488
00:54:58,478 --> 00:55:00,178
Be careful.

489
00:55:26,578 --> 00:55:30,927
He's searching for the armour,
just like his insolent father.

490
00:55:30,928 --> 00:55:32,628
Yes, sister.

491
00:55:32,778 --> 00:55:36,778
Then we must ensure he does not find
what remains.

492
00:55:48,848 --> 00:55:52,497
Monkey, I think he's in trouble.
We should help him.

493
00:55:52,579 --> 00:55:57,728
Kubo, your aunts are still out there.
I'm sorry. But we have to head for shore.

494
00:55:59,078 --> 00:56:00,778
Kubo!

495
00:56:10,018 --> 00:56:11,718
Look at this.

496
00:56:11,738 --> 00:56:16,418
I come fishing,
and all I reeling is a stinking ape.

497
00:56:16,928 --> 00:56:20,042
How pathetic that this filthy creature

498
00:56:20,043 --> 00:56:22,885
is all that's left of my sister's magic.

499
00:56:22,928 --> 00:56:26,398
This filthy creature will tear you apart.

500
00:57:01,248 --> 00:57:03,018
Kubo...

501
00:57:08,514 --> 00:57:10,365
Kubo...

502
00:57:18,898 --> 00:57:20,598
Kubo!

503
00:57:22,198 --> 00:57:26,718
I've crushed creatures who could
fit this world on their fingernail.

504
00:57:27,238 --> 00:57:29,558
This victory brings me no honour.

505
00:57:33,138 --> 00:57:36,498
Imagine how you're going to feel
when you lose.

506
00:57:39,358 --> 00:57:41,218
I felt loss only once.

507
00:57:42,278 --> 00:57:45,268
Eleven years ago
I lost my sister.

508
00:57:47,208 --> 00:57:51,678
She fell in love with a fool,
and betrayed our father.

509
00:57:53,558 --> 00:57:56,278
She was an ungrateful coward.

510
00:58:06,818 --> 00:58:08,918
Who's the coward now?

511
00:58:21,368 --> 00:58:23,328
I got it! I got it!

512
00:58:25,748 --> 00:58:29,038
Beetle, what happened?
Where's Kubo?

513
00:58:48,948 --> 00:58:51,648
Get back down there,
he's in trouble!

514
00:58:51,958 --> 00:58:53,658
I got it.

515
00:59:06,378 --> 00:59:08,228
Mother. Mother.

516
00:59:43,078 --> 00:59:44,897
It never fails to amaze me

517
00:59:44,898 --> 00:59:49,527
how the creatures down here
fight so hard just to die another day.

518
00:59:49,528 --> 00:59:51,998
Down here there are days
worth fighting for.

519
00:59:53,678 --> 00:59:56,368
There is nothing down here worth anything.

520
01:00:03,408 --> 01:00:06,037
It's pathetic what happened to my sister.

521
01:00:06,038 --> 01:00:09,318
I looked up to her,
she was so strong.

522
01:00:09,858 --> 01:00:12,737
And love made her weak.

523
01:00:12,738 --> 01:00:14,438
No.

524
01:00:15,028 --> 01:00:17,088
It made me strong.

525
01:00:33,638 --> 01:00:35,338
Over here.

526
01:00:36,378 --> 01:00:39,718
The eyes! It was the eyes!

527
01:00:40,538 --> 01:00:42,238
They had him in the trance.

528
01:00:43,028 --> 01:00:44,728
No. No.

529
01:00:45,278 --> 01:00:47,668
Come on. Come on, Kubo.

530
01:00:47,998 --> 01:00:51,218
Wake up.
Please, wake up.

531
01:00:53,498 --> 01:00:55,808
Please, please.
Wake up.

532
01:00:57,138 --> 01:01:00,848
It's gonna be alright.
It's gonna be alright.

533
01:01:01,938 --> 01:01:05,498
I'm here.
I'm right here.

534
01:01:29,168 --> 01:01:32,428
I saw...
-What? What did you see?

535
01:01:32,618 --> 01:01:34,318
I saw...

536
01:01:36,178 --> 01:01:37,878
Mother.

537
01:01:38,278 --> 01:01:39,978
My son.

538
01:01:53,058 --> 01:01:56,018
So you must look more like your dad
than...

539
01:02:00,068 --> 01:02:01,768
You're staring.

540
01:02:02,638 --> 01:02:05,198
Let me guess. You have questions.

541
01:02:06,058 --> 01:02:07,758
Why...
-I'll start.

542
01:02:07,768 --> 01:02:10,628
First question.
If I'm Beetle, and you're Monkey,

543
01:02:11,528 --> 01:02:13,228
why isn't he called "Boy"?

544
01:02:15,328 --> 01:02:17,028
Oh, boy.

545
01:02:17,958 --> 01:02:21,168
Questions can wait.
We need sleep.

546
01:02:21,498 --> 01:02:24,718
Tell us your story.
Then we can sleep.

547
01:02:25,248 --> 01:02:26,948
Please.

548
01:02:27,768 --> 01:02:30,678
Okay. Perhaps you can help me.

549
01:02:39,028 --> 01:02:41,598
The night I met your father...

550
01:02:45,598 --> 01:02:47,298
Mother.

551
01:02:50,498 --> 01:02:55,658
My sisters and I went to the Temple of Bones
to kill Hanzo.

552
01:03:01,578 --> 01:03:03,278
Oh, right.

553
01:03:09,978 --> 01:03:11,897
At the bidding of the Moon King,

554
01:03:11,898 --> 01:03:17,038
my sisters and I had come down from the
night sky to kill many noble warriors.

555
01:03:17,658 --> 01:03:19,838
Your grandfather told us

556
01:03:20,128 --> 01:03:22,897
that any man
who found the magical armour

557
01:03:22,898 --> 01:03:26,438
would grow too powerful
and be a treat to the heavens.

558
01:03:27,138 --> 01:03:31,088
That night,
I arrived at the temple before my sisters.

559
01:03:32,568 --> 01:03:35,968
And there he was, the mighty Hanzo.

560
01:03:39,268 --> 01:03:43,998
"You've offended my father", I told him.
"Now you must die."

561
01:03:44,138 --> 01:03:48,258
Yeah, that's so you.
-Beetle, shhh!

562
01:03:49,408 --> 01:03:51,108
We fought...

563
01:03:55,988 --> 01:03:59,598
Hanzo was strong.
But then he stopped.

564
01:04:00,778 --> 01:04:04,148
He looked into my eyes
and uttered four simple words.

565
01:04:05,298 --> 01:04:07,468
These words changed everything.

566
01:04:08,208 --> 01:04:11,780
"I love you..."

567
01:04:12,763 --> 01:04:14,463
"Monkey."

568
01:04:16,168 --> 01:04:19,738
"You are my quest", he whispered.

569
01:04:20,308 --> 01:04:22,537
I had seen the wonders of the universe,

570
01:04:22,538 --> 01:04:26,898
but the warmth of his gaze
as I looked into his eyes,

571
01:04:27,678 --> 01:04:31,008
that...
That I've never known.

572
01:04:31,578 --> 01:04:33,698
It was the humanity I saw.

573
01:04:33,978 --> 01:04:37,578
And that was more powerful
than anything in my cold realm.

574
01:04:38,578 --> 01:04:42,978
And recognizing his compassion,
I recognized my own.

575
01:04:43,858 --> 01:04:47,498
I spared his life,
he gave me mine.

576
01:04:48,678 --> 01:04:51,418
And then he gave me you.

577
01:04:52,768 --> 01:04:54,748
But your grandfather found us.

578
01:04:55,658 --> 01:04:59,438
His rage and my betrayal
shook the heavens.

579
01:05:04,658 --> 01:05:07,508
Your father and his army
gave their lives

580
01:05:08,148 --> 01:05:11,108
allowing me to escape
with you in my arms.

581
01:05:14,488 --> 01:05:17,198
Why does grandfather hate me?

582
01:05:18,328 --> 01:05:21,998
Kubo, he doesn't hate you.

583
01:05:22,788 --> 01:05:25,358
He wants to make you just like him.

584
01:05:25,898 --> 01:05:30,308
Blind to humanity,
as I once was.

585
01:05:31,158 --> 01:05:35,218
Only then you can take your place
beside him, as part of his family.

586
01:05:35,688 --> 01:05:40,598
Cold, and hard, and perfect.

587
01:05:41,888 --> 01:05:44,618
I'll never be like him. Never.

588
01:05:47,528 --> 01:05:49,228
I know.

589
01:05:59,798 --> 01:06:01,498
He's exhausted.

590
01:06:03,258 --> 01:06:05,898
Me too.
-I am not tucking you in.

591
01:06:10,728 --> 01:06:12,428
You're hurt?

592
01:06:13,288 --> 01:06:14,988
It's just a scratch.

593
01:06:17,098 --> 01:06:22,458
Monkey, why didn't you tell
him sooner who you really are?

594
01:06:24,158 --> 01:06:28,668
The magic that keeps me here,
it's fading.

595
01:06:29,738 --> 01:06:34,668
Soon I'll be gone,
and then Kubo will be alone again.

596
01:06:35,038 --> 01:06:38,618
Not alone.
He is the son of Hanzo.

597
01:06:38,838 --> 01:06:42,278
I'll do everything I can
to keep him from harm.

598
01:06:43,248 --> 01:06:44,948
Thank you, Beetle.

599
01:06:45,398 --> 01:06:50,078
To know Kubo has someone to
watch over him, when I am gone,

600
01:06:51,648 --> 01:06:54,208
that would be a fine way to end my story.

601
01:06:55,458 --> 01:06:58,608
Your story will never end.

602
01:06:59,038 --> 01:07:03,358
It will be told by him,
and by the people he shares it with.

603
01:07:03,688 --> 01:07:08,367
And by the people they shared with.
And by the people they shared with.

604
01:07:08,368 --> 01:07:12,468
And by the people they shared with.
And by the people... -Beetle.

605
01:07:12,958 --> 01:07:19,348
The point is, your story will live on
in him.

606
01:07:49,538 --> 01:07:51,238
Hello, my young friend.

607
01:07:51,998 --> 01:07:54,018
Why don't you join in my song?

608
01:07:55,138 --> 01:07:58,938
But how did you... You are...
-Even blinder than you?

609
01:07:59,798 --> 01:08:02,148
Twice as much, to be precise.

610
01:08:03,138 --> 01:08:06,208
Which means I see double the truth.

611
01:08:07,018 --> 01:08:08,718
This is all the dream.

612
01:08:09,688 --> 01:08:13,468
Is this a good dream or a bad one?
-See for yourself.

613
01:08:31,368 --> 01:08:34,828
My Father's fortress.
-Yes.

614
01:08:41,588 --> 01:08:44,308
The last piece of the armour.
It's here?

615
01:08:45,298 --> 01:08:48,398
Follow the setting sun
and you'll find it.

616
01:08:48,708 --> 01:08:51,648
In the place that might
have been your home.

617
01:08:52,618 --> 01:08:55,588
Claim your birthright, Kubo.

618
01:08:56,418 --> 01:08:59,878
Give this story a happy ending.

619
01:09:05,028 --> 01:09:07,047
Mother, Beetle, wake up.

620
01:09:07,048 --> 01:09:10,388
I'm up. I'm up.
-I am down.

621
01:09:12,458 --> 01:09:14,498
I think I've slept on something.

622
01:09:16,058 --> 01:09:17,867
Sword Uncomfortable.

623
01:09:17,868 --> 01:09:21,868
The helmet, I know where it is.
I saw it in dream, Beetle.

624
01:09:22,408 --> 01:09:24,108
A dream...

625
01:09:24,358 --> 01:09:27,257
It doesn't mean
anything in particular.

626
01:09:27,258 --> 01:09:31,098
I mean, I dreamt I fought a giant
skeleton with swords in its head.

627
01:09:31,458 --> 01:09:34,578
That really happened.
-Oh, yeah.

628
01:09:35,368 --> 01:09:38,498
Beetle, come on. This way.

629
01:10:15,438 --> 01:10:20,588
I spy with my one eye
something beginning with S.

630
01:10:23,268 --> 01:10:24,968
Snow?
-No.

631
01:10:26,628 --> 01:10:29,488
Snowflake?
-No. -Okay.

632
01:10:31,478 --> 01:10:34,608
Snow-covered trees?
-Nothing to do with snow.

633
01:10:35,348 --> 01:10:37,378
How about serious?

634
01:10:38,058 --> 01:10:39,758
Stupid.

635
01:10:40,548 --> 01:10:42,978
Okay. I got it. Snow.

636
01:10:43,448 --> 01:10:47,138
He said it wasn't snow.
-It's the song.

637
01:10:47,638 --> 01:10:50,438
That's not fair.
How do you see a song?

638
01:10:50,648 --> 01:10:52,348
You look.

639
01:10:54,168 --> 01:10:55,868
Golden heron.

640
01:10:56,468 --> 01:10:59,038
It's believed that they
hold souls of the departed,

641
01:10:59,348 --> 01:11:01,728
carrying them over to
ever they need to go.

642
01:11:04,398 --> 01:11:06,098
What are they singing?

643
01:11:07,258 --> 01:11:12,228
It's beautiful. -Many say the songs
about what happens when we die.

644
01:11:13,128 --> 01:11:16,478
How don't we just disappear.

645
01:11:16,758 --> 01:11:20,157
We don't?
So, what happens to us?

646
01:11:20,158 --> 01:11:22,758
Like Kubo's paper,
we shift.

647
01:11:23,018 --> 01:11:26,828
We transform so we can continue
our story to another place.

648
01:11:27,378 --> 01:11:31,158
The end of one story
is merely the beginning of another.

649
01:11:54,228 --> 01:11:56,078
I remember this place.

650
01:12:36,798 --> 01:12:39,618
This is where my father
prepared for his quest.

651
01:13:04,758 --> 01:13:06,528
There's something that
I don't understand.

652
01:13:07,078 --> 01:13:08,948
Why would the helmet be here?

653
01:13:13,858 --> 01:13:15,558
Kubo!

654
01:13:46,958 --> 01:13:48,658
Release us!

655
01:13:48,838 --> 01:13:50,538
Sister.

656
01:13:52,258 --> 01:13:54,428
I remember how we looked up to you.

657
01:13:55,598 --> 01:13:58,378
Of all of us you surely brightest.

658
01:13:59,048 --> 01:14:00,748
Such a waste.

659
01:14:01,218 --> 01:14:05,647
All we ever wished was to be a family
in our home among the stars.

660
01:14:05,648 --> 01:14:09,257
I think we have very different
definitions of family.

661
01:14:09,258 --> 01:14:10,977
Don't you touch him, you witch!

662
01:14:10,978 --> 01:14:16,257
And then there's you, the thieving
insect who stole my sister's soul.

663
01:14:16,258 --> 01:14:17,958
What?

664
01:14:19,248 --> 01:14:20,948
This is precious.

665
01:14:21,348 --> 01:14:24,978
You've been together all this time
and you haven't even realised?

666
01:14:30,158 --> 01:14:35,028
You took her from us. It was only
fitting we took something from you.

667
01:14:35,438 --> 01:14:38,497
How swiftly those memories
spilled from your head,

668
01:14:38,498 --> 01:14:42,148
wiping out all recollection
of your obscene union...

669
01:14:42,758 --> 01:14:45,628
Hanzo.
-What?

670
01:14:46,618 --> 01:14:48,318
Hanzo?

671
01:14:49,488 --> 01:14:51,508
I didn't know.

672
01:14:54,838 --> 01:14:56,538
No!

673
01:15:01,518 --> 01:15:04,918
I am forgetting why I came here for.

674
01:15:53,338 --> 01:15:55,038
Mother!

675
01:16:11,918 --> 01:16:13,618
It's okay, I'm here.

676
01:16:14,558 --> 01:16:16,258
Father.

677
01:16:16,728 --> 01:16:18,428
My son.

678
01:16:24,128 --> 01:16:27,998
Seems I'm married to a bug.
-Yeah.

679
01:16:29,298 --> 01:16:30,998
A samurai bug.

680
01:16:34,568 --> 01:16:36,498
You are my quest.

681
01:16:37,798 --> 01:16:39,498
You always have been.

682
01:16:41,478 --> 01:16:45,868
Hanzo, keep him safe
no matter what.

683
01:16:48,388 --> 01:16:50,088
I promise I will.

684
01:16:59,208 --> 01:17:00,908
No!

685
01:17:03,278 --> 01:17:05,598
Fly home, Kubo.

686
01:20:00,968 --> 01:20:03,208
Kubo, is that you?

687
01:20:05,858 --> 01:20:07,697
You have to leave this place.

688
01:20:07,698 --> 01:20:10,228
The Moon King. He is coming.

689
01:20:23,968 --> 01:20:27,598
Grandfather, it's me, Kubo.

690
01:20:28,648 --> 01:20:30,348
I know you can see me.

691
01:20:33,158 --> 01:20:34,858
Hello, grandson.

692
01:20:35,858 --> 01:20:40,378
So good to see you at last.
So to speak.

693
01:20:42,638 --> 01:20:45,948
And I see you found the armour.

694
01:20:47,068 --> 01:20:49,273
Seems your mother had
reason to bring you

695
01:20:49,308 --> 01:20:52,058
to this dreadful place after all.

696
01:20:56,648 --> 01:20:58,348
I see.

697
01:21:00,048 --> 01:21:03,338
I know you do.
That's how all this began.

698
01:21:03,518 --> 01:21:05,218
You finally saw me.

699
01:21:05,618 --> 01:21:09,108
It was my fault.
I should have listened to my parents.

700
01:21:10,628 --> 01:21:15,217
Kubo, we both want
the exact same thing.

701
01:21:15,218 --> 01:21:17,018
You want to take my other eye.

702
01:21:17,218 --> 01:21:18,918
That's what you want!

703
01:21:19,348 --> 01:21:24,288
Yes. But do you know why I want it?

704
01:21:24,788 --> 01:21:28,628
Because you're old,
and mean, and cruel.

705
01:21:28,918 --> 01:21:30,978
Now that's a little harsh.

706
01:21:31,478 --> 01:21:35,727
As long as you cling to
that silly useless eye

707
01:21:35,728 --> 01:21:40,908
you can't come up
to live with me in the heavens.

708
01:21:41,508 --> 01:21:45,748
You'll be stucked down here
in this hell,

709
01:21:46,208 --> 01:21:52,104
staring with that lonely eye
at hate, and heartache,

710
01:21:52,129 --> 01:21:55,898
and suffering, and death.

711
01:21:59,318 --> 01:22:03,588
Where I want to take you
we have none of those things.

712
01:22:04,158 --> 01:22:09,267
It'll just be you with your family,
where you belong.

713
01:22:09,268 --> 01:22:12,707
My family is gone.
You killed them.

714
01:22:12,708 --> 01:22:17,648
No. They brought their
fate upon themselves.

715
01:22:17,968 --> 01:22:23,257
They disgraced me,
and upset the order of everything!

716
01:22:23,258 --> 01:22:25,518
That's how your story goes.

717
01:22:26,808 --> 01:22:33,578
Kubo, when you're up there with me,
you'll be beyond stories.

718
01:22:33,758 --> 01:22:35,528
You will be

719
01:22:36,658 --> 01:22:38,358
immortal.

720
01:22:38,648 --> 01:22:40,378
You will be

721
01:22:42,808 --> 01:22:44,508
infinite.

722
01:22:45,268 --> 01:22:48,698
No. You're wrong. Not infinite.

723
01:22:48,918 --> 01:22:51,108
All stories have an end.

724
01:22:51,728 --> 01:22:53,488
Is that right?

725
01:22:54,478 --> 01:22:57,688
And how does this story end?

726
01:23:00,488 --> 01:23:02,218
I kill you.

727
01:23:02,458 --> 01:23:06,697
Very well.
Is this your wish?

728
01:23:06,698 --> 01:23:10,997
To do battle with a hideous monster
who ruined your life?

729
01:23:10,998 --> 01:23:15,598
To prove your worth?
Like your doomed father.

730
01:23:16,258 --> 01:23:18,198
How mortal.

731
01:24:37,618 --> 01:24:40,448
You want to be human?

732
01:24:40,798 --> 01:24:44,858
Then share their weakness!

733
01:24:45,818 --> 01:24:50,078
Suffer their humiliation!

734
01:24:50,698 --> 01:24:52,928
Feel their pain!

735
01:25:36,618 --> 01:25:40,548
This is the end of your story.

736
01:25:40,698 --> 01:25:44,768
Now take one last look
with that lonely eye.

737
01:25:45,408 --> 01:25:52,282
One last look at this
wretched place you call home.

738
01:25:53,278 --> 01:25:54,978
I'm not leaving.

739
01:25:55,778 --> 01:25:57,928
For every horrible thing down here,

740
01:25:58,698 --> 01:26:00,628
there's something
far more beautiful.

741
01:26:01,208 --> 01:26:04,317
My mother saw it. So and my father.

742
01:26:04,318 --> 01:26:07,408
I see it,
even with just one eye.

743
01:26:07,598 --> 01:26:13,178
Then I'll just have to rip it out
of your head again, won't I?

744
01:26:16,208 --> 01:26:19,018
If you must blink,
do it now.

745
01:26:23,058 --> 01:26:25,108
I know why you want my eye.

746
01:26:25,998 --> 01:26:29,077
Because without it,
I can't look into the eyes of another

747
01:26:29,078 --> 01:26:31,657
and see their soul,
their love.

748
01:26:31,658 --> 01:26:34,518
Everything you love is gone!

749
01:26:35,198 --> 01:26:38,738
Everything you knew
has been taken from you.

750
01:26:38,938 --> 01:26:43,978
No, it's in my memories, the most
powerful kind of magic there is.

751
01:26:57,028 --> 01:26:59,788
It makes us stronger
than you'll ever be.

752
01:27:02,758 --> 01:27:06,778
These are the memories of those
we have loved and lost.

753
01:27:07,218 --> 01:27:10,537
And if we hold their stories
deep in our hearts,

754
01:27:11,011 --> 01:27:13,768
then you will never
take them away from us.

755
01:27:26,648 --> 01:27:28,458
That really is the least of it.

756
01:27:48,538 --> 01:27:50,238
Where am I?

757
01:27:50,248 --> 01:27:52,378
Hello, grandfather.
-What?

758
01:27:53,058 --> 01:27:55,428
Hello. What...

759
01:27:56,418 --> 01:27:59,868
What happened to your eye?
-Don't you remember?

760
01:28:00,878 --> 01:28:04,018
No. I'm sorry, young man.

761
01:28:05,078 --> 01:28:10,618
It seems I've forgotten my story.
Can you help me?

762
01:28:12,738 --> 01:28:15,678
I'll tell him.
-No, we'll all tell him.

763
01:28:16,058 --> 01:28:18,738
We'll tell him everything
he needs to know.

764
01:28:19,598 --> 01:28:26,127
You are the kindest, sweetest man
to ever live in this village.

765
01:28:26,128 --> 01:28:27,888
Really?
-Yes.

766
01:28:28,798 --> 01:28:33,287
Every day you walk around smiling
and handing out coins to children.

767
01:28:33,288 --> 01:28:35,858
Like me.
-And old women.

768
01:28:37,158 --> 01:28:40,818
You taught my kids to swim.
-What?

769
01:28:41,358 --> 01:28:44,147
And you give blankets to the poor.
-You're a good man.

770
01:28:44,148 --> 01:28:46,837
You fed the hungry.
-You always lend a helping hand.

771
01:28:46,838 --> 01:28:50,338
You are a great example.
-Yes. -Absolutely.

772
01:28:50,998 --> 01:28:54,287
It turns out I'm pretty selfless.
-That's why we love you.

773
01:28:54,288 --> 01:28:57,828
You know, we have something in common.

774
01:28:58,448 --> 01:29:00,918
We both adore your grandson.

775
01:29:01,978 --> 01:29:04,278
His name is Kubo.

776
01:29:06,658 --> 01:29:08,358
Kubo.

777
01:29:09,668 --> 01:29:13,078
I'm sorry, but I...

778
01:29:13,658 --> 01:29:15,358
But I don't remember.

779
01:29:16,118 --> 01:29:19,978
Well, your grandson's a storyteller.

780
01:29:20,888 --> 01:29:23,968
He'll tell you all the stories
you've forgotten.

781
01:29:25,288 --> 01:29:26,988
Really?

782
01:29:29,828 --> 01:29:31,528
Of course.

783
01:29:58,878 --> 01:30:01,878
Hello, mother, father.

784
01:30:03,258 --> 01:30:05,808
I know my stories can
tend to get a little...

785
01:30:06,918 --> 01:30:10,948
long, so I'll keep this brief.

786
01:30:12,008 --> 01:30:15,298
I'm very grateful I've had
the chance to meet you both.

787
01:30:15,918 --> 01:30:19,168
Hear your wisdom, feel your kindness.

788
01:30:20,208 --> 01:30:22,178
Even eat a meal sitting between you.

789
01:30:23,778 --> 01:30:25,478
This was a happy story.

790
01:30:26,528 --> 01:30:30,238
But, it could still
be a whole lot happier.

791
01:30:32,288 --> 01:30:37,978
I don't know exactly what the rules are,
or how this works.

792
01:30:38,528 --> 01:30:42,078
But if there were any
way to... You know.

793
01:30:43,338 --> 01:30:45,038
I still need you.

794
01:30:46,028 --> 01:30:48,528
So I could say this
has been a happy story.

795
01:30:49,328 --> 01:30:52,698
Or I could feel it,
we could all feel it.

796
01:30:53,938 --> 01:30:55,792
Then we could end this story...

797
01:30:57,016 --> 01:30:58,993
Together.

798
01:31:41,278 --> 01:31:42,978
The end.

799
