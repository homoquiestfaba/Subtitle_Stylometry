1
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:47,320
Mr. Woodson! Take a shot.

2
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,080
Oh, nice shot.

3
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:59,760
- Get up.
- Hey, over here!

4
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,720
- Mr. Woodson!
- Nice pass.

5
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:22,800
Hey, John.

6
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,560
Listen, the board met
this afternoon...

7
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:27,360
...and it's as bad as we thought.

8
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:29,560
They're cutting back
the whole department.

9
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:31,400
What, are you laying me off?

10
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:35,160
We knew this was coming. At this
point, it's just a leave of absence.

11
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:38,320
With any luck, you'll be back
with us next fall.

12
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,000
You're laying me off.

13
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:47,800
- I'm sorry, John.
- That's okay.

14
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:09,040
Hey, hey. Michael Jordan was only
5'2" when he started.

15
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:11,960
Of course, he was in kindergarten
and he could dunk the ball.

16
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:14,520
Just keep practicing. All right?

17
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:24,120
<i>- Hello?
- John? It's Charlene. </i>

18
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:28,760
Charlene? Wow, I was just
thinking about you the other day.

19
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:31,920
Listen, I'm so glad I was able
to reach you. I'm in town.

20
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:34,480
I was hoping you might have
some time to get together.

21
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:37,640
Oh, yeah, I got a lot of time.

22
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:40,840
Well, I'm staying at the Hilton,
near the airport.

23
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,840
So, what did you wanna
talk to me about?

24
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:49,080
Last month I was in Peru
doing a piece on a relief project.

25
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:53,520
We went to this place called Viciente
and I met a priest there.

26
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:57,560
His name is Father Jose,
he's also an archaeologist.

27
00:04:57,760 --> 00:05:02,440
He told me about some scrolls that
he had discovered a few years ago.

28
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:04,600
What kind of scrolls?

29
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:08,520
Ancient writings.
No one knows who wrote them.

30
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:11,000
It's a prophecy.

31
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:14,080
Really? What does it predict?

32
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:17,320
According to Father Jose,
it says that...

33
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:23,680
...all the conflict, the chaos
in this world, it's changing us.

34
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:25,800
And what does that mean?

35
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:29,640
It means that the violence
is waking us up, in a way.

36
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:34,840
The prophecy says that
we're going to discover something.

37
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:37,000
Which is?

38
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:38,760
He was vague about it...

39
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:42,040
...but he said that it'll make us
look at everything differently.

40
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:49,240
I know this all sounds weird...

41
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:53,800
...but if you'll just listen...

42
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:57,160
Okay. Okay. I'll listen.

43
00:05:57,320 --> 00:06:00,120
So when is this revelation
supposed to happen?

44
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:03,360
The prophecy says it'll begin during
the first years of this century.

45
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:05,360
Well, that's now.

46
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:08,120
Yeah, I know.

47
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:14,480
Excuse me, sir. Can I
please get my luggage?

48
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:16,560
Certainly. Will you be needing
a taxi today?

49
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:19,800
- Yes, please.
- The baggage will be out by the cab.

50
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,600
Great. It's just one bag.

51
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:31,320
Have you ever wondered why
we don't spend more time together?

52
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:33,880
How long have I known you,
five or six years?

53
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:35,560
About that long, yeah.

54
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:37,840
How many relationships
have you had?

55
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:43,320
You get involved with somebody
because it makes you feel good...

56
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:46,920
...but it never works out
because you're not really there.

57
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:49,840
Whatever happened to that
big theory you were trying to find?

58
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,280
Inspire all those kids.
What happened to that?

59
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:55,000
I found out it isn't that easy.

60
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:59,320
You should go to Viciente, John.

61
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:03,360
They're studying this prophecy
down there. I can't explain it...

62
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:07,120
...but the people there are different.
This place is different.

63
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:09,600
Why are you calling me
about all this now?

64
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:14,040
Because every time I would think of
this prophecy, I would think of you.

65
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:16,200
Then I found out that
I had a stopover here.

66
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:19,920
Maybe you're hearing this
at the right time.

67
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:38,360
Hey, Meredith.

68
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:43,360
Whatcha say, darling?
How are you?

69
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:52,400
Have a good day, girl?
Better than mine, I hope.

70
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:54,000
<i>You should go to Viciente, John.
The people there are different. </i>

71
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:57,040
<i>This place is different.</i>

72
00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:00,720
Travel agency...

73
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:20,760
Cancellation? When's it leaving?
Tomorrow?

74
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:24,120
Yeah, I'll take it. All right, thanks.

75
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:29,440
Wanna go to Peru?

76
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:36,400
<i>I haven't been in Lima in quite a while.
How long have you lived there?</i>

77
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:38,960
Oh, I'm new to Peru.
I've lived in Bolivia...

78
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,800
...for the last 10 years, so I haven't
met your Father Jose.

79
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:45,080
In any case, the local priests are
so numerous, aren't they?

80
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:47,480
I suppose they are.

81
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:51,160
Excuse me. I just heard you
mention a Father Jose?

82
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:54,840
A friend of mine
just told me about him.

83
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:57,880
Dobson. Dr. Sidney Dobson.

84
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:01,440
Would you like a drink?
Two more Scotches, please.

85
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,480
Sure, right away.

86
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:08,520
- So are you a scientist?
- Oh, no. John Woodson, tourist.

87
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:11,960
But I'm going to Peru because I'm
interested in this place called Viciente.

88
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:13,560
Yes.

89
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:20,560
I met Jose in Boston
at an anthropological meeting.

90
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,960
I kept in touch over the years.

91
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:27,320
I had no idea what he had found until
several weeks ago. He called me...

92
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:30,800
...and asked me to help affirm
the prophecy's authenticity.

93
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:35,760
He sent me copies of the first two
scrolls along with translations.

94
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:39,120
Real thing.
There's no doubt about it.

95
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:43,440
Written no later than 5 or 6 B.C.
But you know the curious thing?

96
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,240
They were found in a wooden box...

97
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:49,200
<i>... which dates to
only about 1600 A.D. </i>

98
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:51,880
<i>Someone in the early Church
had buried them. </i>

99
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:55,280
Early Church? Franciscan or Jesuit?

100
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:59,000
Oh, I'm a history teacher.

101
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:03,000
Well, apparently Franciscan. Although
they seem to be inspired by a pope.

102
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:06,760
Celestine V, I think.

103
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:11,200
You mentioned that you had copies of
them. Can you tell me what they say?

104
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:12,800
No, not really.

105
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:16,560
They talk about a shift in human
understanding, I don't know.

106
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:19,480
But, you know, the curious thing,
the most astonishing thing...

107
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:22,160
...is the description
of the modern era.

108
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:27,120
Our problems, our technologies.
I mean, it is utterly amazing.

109
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:28,400
Think about it.

110
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:32,920
A document this old, speaking
in such detail about our time?

111
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,440
Think about it.

112
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:49,560
It was a pleasure
traveling with you.

113
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:53,040
- You staying in town?
- Delgado.

114
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:55,080
I'm just down the street
at the Hacienda.

115
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:58,360
Father Jose's church is just down
the street from there.

116
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:01,200
Why don't you come see him
with me in the morning?

117
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:02,680
He has the original scrolls.

118
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:06,160
He wants to make them public
as soon as possible.

119
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:08,720
- Why's that?
- I don't know.

120
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:11,640
You can ask him yourself
in the morning.

121
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:23,680
You see someone
down there you know?

122
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:27,640
Oh, no. No, not really.

123
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:31,440
Pretty girl.

124
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:10,680
Saint Francis was a great man.

125
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:13,280
He could see beauty
where others couldn't.

126
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:16,880
- I'm sorry, I was just taking a walk.
- It's all right.

127
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:20,960
American? Now, what has
brought you to Peru?

128
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:24,560
You're Father Jose, aren't you?

129
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:27,160
I'm John Woodson.

130
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:30,240
A friend of mine, Charlene Benet,
met you a few weeks ago.

131
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:32,680
And she told you
about our prophecy.

132
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:38,360
John, listen to me. I know you.

133
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:40,600
You're here to do
something important.

134
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:42,320
<i>But you need to leave quickly.</i>

135
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:44,720
- What are you talking about?
- Go!

136
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:48,000
I will try to help you.

137
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:03,800
You have caused us
a lot of trouble, old man.

138
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:09,480
It was in a hidden compartment
in the wall of the sacristy.

139
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:13,680
You should have
hidden them better, Padre.

140
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:17,880
Eight scrolls.

141
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:24,120
Where's the ninth?

142
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,240
Okay.

143
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:33,400
One way or another,
I'm going to put an end to all of this.

144
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:36,680
You're going to try.
You will do everything you can.

145
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:39,160
But it's already too late.

146
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:48,280
You are very calm
for a man about to die.

147
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:52,480
Everybody dies. Even you, senor.

148
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:05,520
John! Wait. Slow down a minute.

149
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:07,360
Why didn't you just call the police?

150
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:09,680
I'm not sure what's going on.
It could be nothing.

151
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:13,800
Nothing? You got me out of bed in the
middle of the night for nothing?

152
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:30,040
Don't do that.
You'll never get rid of her.

153
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:36,160
What the...? John!

154
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:42,760
Need some help?

155
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:55,520
They seem to have left.

156
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:01,680
We were going to that church a block
away, looking for the priest.

157
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:04,680
Father Jose?

158
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:08,560
- Yeah.
- And who is "we"?

159
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:13,520
This professor, I met him on a plane.
He's looking for some artifact.

160
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:15,480
The prophecy.

161
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:19,840
Go on.

162
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:21,600
Wait a minute.

163
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:23,800
You know about all this?

164
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:26,000
Who are you?

165
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:30,000
Part of your story, apparently.
My name is Wil.

166
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:33,080
- John.
- I'm a guide.

167
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:38,840
I was working with Jose
when he found the scrolls.

168
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:41,880
That's him, yeah.

169
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:46,680
- Who's this woman?
- Julia Sims. She's a friend, a linguist.

170
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:49,320
- Translated most of the prophecy.
- And him?

171
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:50,880
His name is Father Sanchez.

172
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:53,800
He lives in the mountains
with the local Indians.

173
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:55,640
Philosopher, you could say.

174
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:58,760
I have a feeling you'll meet him.

175
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:05,880
Now, what about your friend, the
professor? Tell me what happened.

176
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:09,680
They took him, right in front of me.
That's why I was running.

177
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:12,720
I think they got Father Jose too.

178
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:18,440
Put this on.

179
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:21,880
We have to leave.

180
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:28,560
You think it'd be safe
to go back to the hotel?

181
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:36,000
- I don't think so.
- Maybe you could take me...

182
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:37,800
...to the American Embassy.

183
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:44,200
Too risky.

184
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:56,040
General.
His Excellency Cardinal Sebastian.

185
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:01,360
Such a surprise
to have you visit me.

186
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,040
You've arrested an American.

187
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:07,640
A professor.

188
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:11,480
On his way to meet with
your Father Jose.

189
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:13,640
Cigar?

190
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:18,520
Don't you realize this will only bring
more publicity?

191
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:21,040
You should have consulted me.

192
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:25,920
Permit me to remind you,
Your Excellency.

193
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:29,600
It was you who informed me
of the dangers of the prophecy.

194
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:33,240
And it was you who sought my help.

195
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:36,200
I said the document was heretical.

196
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:38,720
That it needed to be contained.

197
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:41,240
I didn't say create an incident
with the Americans.

198
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:43,320
There will be an investigation.

199
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:46,040
This country is a democracy now.

200
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:50,200
This prophecy
is creating instability...

201
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:52,720
...at a time
when we're already threatened...

202
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:57,480
...by insurrection. Besides, you must
understand that there are other...

203
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:04,280
...interests involved in this matter now.
This prophecy must be dealt with.

204
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:07,680
Other interests.

205
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:11,120
Father Jose, he was not present
at Mass this morning.

206
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:13,000
No one can find him.

207
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:18,280
People go missing every day
in Peru.

208
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:23,320
If you want,
I'll have someone look into it.

209
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:26,640
The scrolls are Church property.

210
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:29,960
They must be returned to me.

211
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:50,960
It's all I can bear,
to tolerate his arrogance.

212
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:54,640
In a moment, he can remove
anyone from the Church.

213
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:56,920
Damn them forever.

214
00:21:57,800 --> 00:22:01,520
We might control
the people's minds...

215
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:04,240
...but he controls their souls.

216
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:07,960
He can be used.
That's all that interests me.

217
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:10,000
This is all a waste of my time.

218
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:13,240
This prophecy, it's nothing.

219
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:15,960
Why do you fear it so?

220
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:22,640
Because, general,
in the world it predicts...

221
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:25,840
...there's no need for people
like you and me.

222
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:35,640
Do your part and
you'll get what you want.

223
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:41,360
Do you have the pictures
of the other American?

224
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:48,280
General, what about
Professor Dobson?

225
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:52,760
Call the American Embassy.
Tell them his detention was a mistake.

226
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:57,640
Then take him to the airport.
I think he'll be ready to go home.

227
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:05,920
Now, who are you?

228
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:09,480
And what are you doing
in my country?

229
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:18,680
I called the embassy.
Dobson's okay.

230
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:23,240
They're saying it was a case of
mistaken identity.

231
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:25,200
He's already headed back to
the States.

232
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:27,080
What about Father Jose?

233
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:29,840
No one has seen him.

234
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:33,560
I think someone is trying to
suppress the prophecy.

235
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:36,240
Who'd do that, Wil? Why?

236
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:38,200
Certain people in the government,
probably.

237
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:40,720
They view it as a threat.

238
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:44,600
It's not, of course,
but they don't see that.

239
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:46,440
Maybe I should try to get home too.

240
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:48,960
If they let Dobson go,
maybe it's safe for me to leave.

241
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:53,080
Or maybe you should come with me.

242
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:58,760
Do you suppose it was an accident
that you came to Peru...

243
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:00,680
...that you met Dobson?

244
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:05,320
How did you end up taking
that particular flight?

245
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:07,160
Think about it.

246
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:10,400
Why did I see you from my window
when I did?

247
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:11,840
You're gonna love this.

248
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,720
I was all set to get out of there,
I was packed, I was ready...

249
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:18,440
...and then I had this strange feeling
I'd forgotten something.

250
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:21,480
That's when you showed up.

251
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:28,800
Are you telling me
this is some kind of a fate thing?

252
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:31,640
That I'm supposed to go with you?
For what?

253
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:36,600
There's part of the prophecy
that still has to be found.

254
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:42,680
One more scroll. The ninth.

255
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:46,600
No, no, no. Forget about it.

256
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:48,600
I don't even know if
I believe this stuff.

257
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:52,920
All I had in mind was to come to Peru
and find Viciente. That's it.

258
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:55,720
Where you headed to, anyway?

259
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:57,600
Viciente.

260
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:25,680
Viciente, what's it like?

261
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:29,200
It's an old ranch, about 1000 acres.

262
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:31,440
Been in the owner's family
for hundreds of years.

263
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:34,560
It goes all the way back to
the Spanish land grants.

264
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:36,320
The Moors.

265
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:39,760
These days, it's a kind of retreat.

266
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:43,760
And the people there,
they're studying the prophecy?

267
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:45,440
Some of them.

268
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:46,880
Tell me about it.

269
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:50,840
So far,
we've discovered eight scrolls.

270
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:54,480
Each one contains a certain truth
about our existence.

271
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:56,560
We call them insights.

272
00:25:56,760 --> 00:26:01,120
Insights, the prophecy says,
we've all gotta understand.

273
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:06,640
Look, I could describe these insights
to you right now...

274
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:08,920
...and you would hear my words...

275
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:12,240
...but you have to do more than that.

276
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,320
You have to experience it
for yourself.

277
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:19,240
The prophecy has to happen to you.

278
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:25,920
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

279
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:31,160
I'm talking about
seeing the world, John.

280
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:33,360
The way it really is.

281
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:55,280
You get the first insight
when you realize...

282
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:57,840
...there's a mystery
operating out there...

283
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,840
...moving us somewhere,
for a reason.

284
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:05,120
It's there for everyone,
but only a few notice.

285
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:08,920
You're talking about
these weird coincidences?

286
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:13,120
Once you begin to really look,
you start seeing them more and more.

287
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:16,760
Well, if it's true they have meaning,
that would be incredible.

288
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:20,120
I mean, I know history.
That would change everything.

289
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:24,520
That's the second insight,
that the world is about to change.

290
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:27,840
What about the others?

291
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:34,480
In time,
you'll open up your perception...

292
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:36,160
...find your guidance.

293
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:39,560
You'll discover
why you're really here.

294
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:43,600
What about
the missing ninth scroll?

295
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:46,080
I believe it puts the others
into perspective.

296
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,040
Shows us where it's all leading.

297
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:55,480
And what makes you think
you can ever find it?

298
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:01,040
Because that's why I'm here.

299
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:27,600
Dream anything last night?

300
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:33,400
Yeah. Little girl
I dreamed about before.

301
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:35,280
It makes no sense.

302
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:36,760
It's probably important.

303
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:39,640
Why would you say that?

304
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:42,160
Because regardless of
how confusing they are...

305
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:44,640
...dreams are always trying to
tell us something.

306
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:48,080
Maybe you just need
a larger perspective.

307
00:28:57,720 --> 00:28:59,880
My God.

308
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:02,880
What is this place?

309
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:05,000
Celestine ruins.

310
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:08,120
They found the
first eight scrolls there.

311
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:10,960
- Maybe the ninth is there too.
- Maybe.

312
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:13,040
What's that over there?

313
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:17,560
The mission. Cardinal Sebastian
had it rebuilt 10 years ago.

314
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:19,320
He's the head of the Church here.

315
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:21,720
Viciente, where's that?

316
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:24,680
In a hurry?

317
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:45,040
Rebels.

318
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:47,000
It's been going on for a while here.

319
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:49,360
They're trying to
overthrow the government?

320
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:52,640
These things are always about
power struggle.

321
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:56,280
- They're really well supplied.
- Yeah.

322
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:01,040
Let's move.

323
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:32,560
Miguel.

324
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:37,240
Wil. I had a feeling you'd show up.

325
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:42,760
Good to see you.

326
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:47,520
It's good to see you, my friend.

327
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:50,760
Julia's already arrived
and Father Sanchez is on his way.

328
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:52,400
I knew it.

329
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:54,960
You think it's time, don't you?

330
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:57,680
Yeah. I do.

331
00:30:57,840 --> 00:30:59,400
John.

332
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:04,320
Meet my friend, Miguel.
We are his guests here.

333
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:09,240
Hi. It's a beautiful place.
Heck of a time getting here.

334
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:13,320
Yeah. We like to consider it
our little oasis.

335
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:17,320
Well, look what the wind blew in.

336
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:20,280
Julia. Julia.

337
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:23,160
I saw your truck come in.

338
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:25,960
I'm so glad you're here.

339
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:28,280
Did you drive straight through?

340
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:29,840
- Meet John.
- Hi.

341
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,280
- Nice to meet you.
- Hi.

342
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:35,360
We've been working on the
translations and we found something.

343
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:40,040
It seems to be saying that
the ninth isn't on a scroll at all.

344
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:42,760
It's going to just appear.

345
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:45,400
Appear?

346
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:47,400
Could be there's something
we have to do.

347
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:49,880
Something to make it happen.

348
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:52,880
That was some ride.

349
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:55,080
He's involved somehow.

350
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:57,400
Maybe you should talk to him.

351
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,160
It's beautiful, isn't it?

352
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:34,200
Come walk with me.

353
00:32:58,840 --> 00:33:01,400
What's going on here?
What are they doing?

354
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:05,600
Let's just say they're
giving the garden their attention.

355
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,960
How much do you know about
the prophecy?

356
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:15,120
Not that much, not yet.

357
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:19,920
Have you been having dreams?

358
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:23,960
Something brought you here, right?
Synchronicity?

359
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:26,040
Yeah, how'd you know that?

360
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:29,080
Because that's how it begins
for everyone.

361
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:31,960
Wil told me I had to open up,
whatever that means.

362
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:35,360
And you think that's strange?

363
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:39,440
Well, I have no idea what
he's talking about with that. Seriously.

364
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:42,520
There's much more to the world
than you think, John.

365
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:45,080
A beauty...

366
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:47,760
...and energy.

367
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:58,080
You talk about strange,
I know that woman.

368
00:33:58,520 --> 00:33:59,840
I saw her at the airport.

369
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:03,200
Go talk to her, if you'd like. I'll wait.

370
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:08,880
Hi. I hope I'm not disturbing you.

371
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:11,960
I'm John Woodson.
Julia's showing me around.

372
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:14,320
Marjorie Carter.

373
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:25,880
Some place here, huh? I hear it goes
all the way back to colonial times.

374
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:31,000
Yeah. Yeah, no, it's one of the most
incredible spots I have ever seen.

375
00:34:38,680 --> 00:34:40,480
I suppose you're staying here
at the house?

376
00:34:40,680 --> 00:34:42,040
We should get together later.

377
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:44,080
Talk some more about all this stuff.

378
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:46,840
Not this time.

379
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:52,480
Come on, you should do this.
It'll be fun.

380
00:34:54,680 --> 00:34:57,760
You can tell me all about
what's happening here.

381
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:59,680
I'm interested in everything.

382
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:04,160
I've got a lot of work to get through.
I'm gonna get to it.

383
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:06,240
Nice to meet you.

384
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:10,080
What was that?

385
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:12,440
Didn't work out too well, huh?

386
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:15,000
That's the understatement
of the year.

387
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:16,720
What did I say?

388
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:19,280
It's not what you said,
it's what you did.

389
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:22,640
Your energy made her feel as though
you wanted to control her.

390
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:24,240
She felt dominated.

391
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:27,640
Oh, come on. I wasn't doing that.

392
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:30,680
Really? You weren't trying to
coax her into something?

393
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:32,360
- No.
- Manipulate her?

394
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:34,480
She isn't used to that around here.

395
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:37,040
That's completely nuts.
Where are you getting this stuff?

396
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:38,880
I could see it.

397
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:42,920
Remember the halos
the old masters used to paint...

398
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:45,360
...around their religious figures?

399
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:49,200
You think they made those up,
or were they seeing something real?

400
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:53,080
It's the energy, John.
It reveals what we do to each other.

401
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:56,800
You may not be conscious of it,
but you were taking her energy.

402
00:35:58,040 --> 00:35:59,800
I could see it.

403
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:02,040
So could she.

404
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:14,200
How did the afternoon go?

405
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:17,400
I spoke to Julia.

406
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:19,280
So I heard.

407
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:21,080
<i>I got lots of questions.</i>

408
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:23,160
This stuff never ends, does it?

409
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:27,800
It's all gonna make sense,
eventually.

410
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:32,680
Everyone you meet here is
gonna show you something.

411
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:40,920
John and Wil. Please, join us.

412
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:43,560
We've got great people, great food.

413
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:45,800
Everything is fresh from the garden.

414
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:52,680
Miguel?

415
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,680
Who's that man over there,
on the other side of the table?

416
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:59,040
Jensen. He's an archaeologist.

417
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:01,760
He's here on sabbatical.
A friend of a friend.

418
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:05,440
- Would you like me to introduce you?
- No, no, no. Never mind.

419
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:24,360
- I knew I'd find you here.
- Waiting for you.

420
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:27,920
You seem happy.

421
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:30,640
I am. Really good.

422
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:33,520
I'm celebrating my fourth with Tom.

423
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:40,160
Oh, come on, Wil.
You never had time for us anyway.

424
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:44,240
True. But I'm glad for you and Tom.

425
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:47,840
And you and I will always
be connected.

426
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:50,360
University of Miami.

427
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:53,560
Your Hurricanes crushed
my Bulldogs last year.

428
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:54,800
I'm still not over it.

429
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:58,080
Yeah. You got me.

430
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:00,280
I teach there with Julia.

431
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:03,440
I've been helping her with the
translations for about a year now.

432
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:06,680
In fact, I was on my way back
when you saw me.

433
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:08,880
That mean something,
that I saw you?

434
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:12,840
Maybe. Maybe that we have
something to talk about, actually.

435
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,440
If you believe the prophecy.

436
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:20,400
You were thinking
about a child last time.

437
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:22,480
You were going to adopt.

438
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:25,960
It's not that easy.

439
00:38:26,120 --> 00:38:28,600
We've met a few children...

440
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:32,160
...but I guess it has to be
the right one.

441
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:36,120
It'll happen for you.

442
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:43,800
Listen, I've been thinking about
Father Jose.

443
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:47,320
He was too public about it.
I tried to tell him.

444
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:49,040
Others have to know, Wil.

445
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:51,880
They have to know about
the prophecy.

446
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:53,720
Your friend John, for one.

447
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:55,720
Yeah.

448
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,720
What do you think of him?

449
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:02,480
I think he'll get there.

450
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:07,440
Unless, of course,
he gets too distracted.

451
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:09,840
Julia told me that
you could see things happening...

452
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,480
...when we talked in the garden.

453
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:13,840
I glimpsed it, I guess.

454
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:17,840
But to be honest,
I felt it more than anything.

455
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:21,120
There's just something
so familiar about you, I can't...

456
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:23,800
John, this player thing you do
really gets in your way.

457
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:26,480
I'm not playing. Didn't you say
we were supposed to talk?

458
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:29,760
God, it's amazing how easy it is to
lose yourself around some people.

459
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:31,480
Why, are you losing yourself?

460
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:34,520
I'm talking about you.

461
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:44,640
Good night.

462
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:56,440
We're going to do something
about Viciente.

463
00:39:58,600 --> 00:40:02,480
We intend to rid this country of
everyone involved with the prophecy.

464
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:05,960
The opportunity is at hand...

465
00:40:06,120 --> 00:40:09,000
...to destroy all
the remaining translations.

466
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:11,200
Who are you working for?

467
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:13,720
You don't want to know.

468
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:16,160
Just think of them as
powerful people...

469
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:18,280
...who, like you,
have their own agenda.

470
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:21,520
They are making many
investments here in Peru...

471
00:40:22,040 --> 00:40:23,600
...and they demand stability.

472
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:27,040
We must cooperate.

473
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:33,480
They wouldn't be helping you with...

474
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:35,960
...your own political ambitions
as well?

475
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:39,680
They see the prophecy
as disruptive.

476
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:44,120
And it would seem that in this matter,
at least, your interests...

477
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:46,280
...and theirs are the same.

478
00:40:53,080 --> 00:40:55,920
Viciente will cease to be a problem.

479
00:40:57,520 --> 00:40:59,080
It will all be over soon.

480
00:40:59,640 --> 00:41:02,600
I'm asking you not to interfere.

481
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:04,320
Your Excellency.

482
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:21,840
You and Marjorie have
come together for a reason, John.

483
00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:24,760
She's showing you the
third and fourth insights.

484
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:27,640
The prophecy says
we'll stop building ourselves up...

485
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:30,520
...by taking energy from others.

486
00:41:30,680 --> 00:41:36,280
There's another source, inside.
But we have to really connect with it.

487
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:38,680
That's what Wil meant
when he said "open up."

488
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:44,440
And if you open up enough, it literally
changes the way you see the world.

489
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:48,040
But you have to really believe
the experience exists.

490
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:51,000
Open yourself to the possibility that
there's something more...

491
00:41:51,160 --> 00:41:53,760
...right here in front of your eyes.

492
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:04,960
Did you see that?

493
00:42:08,280 --> 00:42:10,840
Come on. I wanna show you
something over here.

494
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:22,680
Wow, Julia, this place is so alive.

495
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:24,600
It's amazing.

496
00:42:25,560 --> 00:42:27,960
Have a seat. Let's try something.

497
00:42:31,720 --> 00:42:33,720
Put your fingers together like this.

498
00:42:35,960 --> 00:42:37,720
- Okay.
- Go ahead.

499
00:42:38,120 --> 00:42:40,320
You're gonna look at the space
between your fingers.

500
00:42:42,840 --> 00:42:46,200
Relax your focus just a bit.
What do you see?

501
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:50,600
Look closely.

502
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:53,960
Let your eyes
go out of focus just a bit.

503
00:42:57,400 --> 00:42:58,680
What do you see?

504
00:43:01,320 --> 00:43:03,600
It's like a wisp of smoke
or something.

505
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:06,600
That's the energy. Now look around.

506
00:43:08,440 --> 00:43:10,360
See that philodendron?

507
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:14,240
It's the opposite of trying to make
something happen. Just let go.

508
00:43:15,640 --> 00:43:17,200
Take in the plant.

509
00:43:18,120 --> 00:43:22,520
The beauty, the color,
the way it stands out with presence.

510
00:43:23,800 --> 00:43:25,240
That's it.

511
00:43:28,360 --> 00:43:30,040
Breathe it in.

512
00:43:30,680 --> 00:43:32,920
Now take in more beauty.

513
00:43:34,440 --> 00:43:36,240
That's amazing.

514
00:43:36,760 --> 00:43:39,160
That's... Oh, hold on. I lost it.

515
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:40,880
Here.

516
00:43:42,920 --> 00:43:43,880
Try again.

517
00:43:49,360 --> 00:43:51,800
Wow, that's incredible!

518
00:43:52,440 --> 00:43:53,760
Senor!

519
00:43:54,760 --> 00:43:56,920
Keep your focus, John.
You have to get this.

520
00:43:57,080 --> 00:43:59,920
Senor John! Senor John!

521
00:44:00,600 --> 00:44:02,920
Senor, the gentleman
in the second cottage...

522
00:44:03,080 --> 00:44:04,720
...he need to speak to you
immediately.

523
00:44:04,920 --> 00:44:06,680
He says very important.

524
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:20,600
- John.
- Hi.

525
00:44:20,760 --> 00:44:23,000
Miguel told me all about you.

526
00:44:23,880 --> 00:44:26,800
Listen, there's something
I have to talk to you about.

527
00:44:28,280 --> 00:44:29,600
How much do you know about Wil?

528
00:44:30,040 --> 00:44:33,320
Wil. I only just recently met him.

529
00:44:33,560 --> 00:44:37,440
I'm sorry, but I have to tell you
Wil is wanted by the military police.

530
00:44:38,200 --> 00:44:39,600
What are you talking about?

531
00:44:39,800 --> 00:44:42,400
They are on the way
to arrest him now.

532
00:44:42,920 --> 00:44:46,040
But if you allow me, I can help you.

533
00:44:46,200 --> 00:44:47,520
How can you help me?

534
00:44:49,880 --> 00:44:52,600
Peru is a very dangerous place
for someone all alone.

535
00:44:52,760 --> 00:44:54,600
In over his head.

536
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,200
I have official clearance
to study the prophecy.

537
00:44:58,360 --> 00:45:00,120
I can move around freely.

538
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:03,760
But I need you to tell me what
you know. Where's the missing scroll?

539
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:06,400
I don't know anything.

540
00:45:08,280 --> 00:45:10,040
But you're one of them, John.

541
00:45:10,200 --> 00:45:12,440
They all accept you.
You must know something.

542
00:45:12,600 --> 00:45:14,640
I can even get you back
to the United States...

543
00:45:14,840 --> 00:45:16,800
...if that's what you want.

544
00:45:17,720 --> 00:45:20,720
But you have to leave with me
right now, before the soldiers come.

545
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:25,600
John. John.

546
00:45:26,520 --> 00:45:27,600
John.

547
00:45:29,120 --> 00:45:33,080
John. We have to go.

548
00:45:33,240 --> 00:45:34,840
Don't listen to him.

549
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:37,960
Your survival depends
on your staying with me.

550
00:45:42,040 --> 00:45:43,640
Are you coming?

551
00:45:51,320 --> 00:45:52,880
Yeah.

552
00:45:54,680 --> 00:45:56,720
You're making a bad mistake,
both of you.

553
00:45:56,920 --> 00:45:59,800
He was undermining your confidence.
Taking your energy.

554
00:45:59,960 --> 00:46:02,920
Now you know what it feels like
when someone does it to you.

555
00:46:03,080 --> 00:46:05,240
I felt weak. I couldn't think.

556
00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:07,480
He's just a remote controller.

557
00:46:07,640 --> 00:46:09,760
But you're probably
gonna have to deal with him...

558
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:11,880
...so you'd better figure it out.

559
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:16,360
Wait. Is that in the prophecy too?

560
00:46:16,600 --> 00:46:20,080
There's a world of energy
that we are all going to understand.

561
00:46:20,280 --> 00:46:23,760
It's the real human condition.
Energy is what we all want.

562
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:26,200
But we're stuck
battling for it with each other...

563
00:46:26,360 --> 00:46:28,800
...instead of finding it in ourselves.

564
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:31,160
That's what you
still have to do, John.

565
00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:33,760
You haven't really
opened up, you know.

566
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:35,560
Wil. Wil.

567
00:46:36,760 --> 00:46:38,960
John. The military is on its way.

568
00:46:39,120 --> 00:46:41,680
You need to leave.
Go while the north road is still open.

569
00:46:41,840 --> 00:46:44,280
- What about Julia and Marjorie?
- They've already left.

570
00:46:44,440 --> 00:46:47,160
You'll be behind them. I'm gonna
go to Lima, see the president.

571
00:46:47,320 --> 00:46:48,920
Maybe something can still be done.

572
00:46:49,080 --> 00:46:51,600
- Listen, you remember my cabin?
- In the rain forest, yes.

573
00:46:51,800 --> 00:46:54,480
It's probably the safest place
for you now.

574
00:46:54,840 --> 00:46:56,240
Wil.

575
00:46:57,920 --> 00:47:01,240
- Finish this thing.
- Yes.

576
00:47:03,160 --> 00:47:04,760
Good luck, Miguel.

577
00:47:20,520 --> 00:47:23,000
Forgive me for what
I've allowed to happen.

578
00:48:08,760 --> 00:48:10,840
Remember I told you
the way to Miguel's place?

579
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:12,400
Yeah?

580
00:48:13,400 --> 00:48:17,360
If anything happens, you go there.
They'll need your help.

581
00:48:17,840 --> 00:48:20,560
- What about you?
- I have to keep going.

582
00:48:20,920 --> 00:48:23,240
I thought you were here
to find the ninth insight.

583
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:25,360
Nothing's changed.

584
00:48:26,520 --> 00:48:29,280
Just keep learning, John.
You'll find help.

585
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:30,480
There's always help.

586
00:48:30,680 --> 00:48:33,160
The right person
will come along if you stay alert.

587
00:48:33,960 --> 00:48:35,800
Something will happen for you.

588
00:48:54,360 --> 00:48:55,800
What was that?

589
00:48:58,080 --> 00:49:01,440
Rebels. Sit tight.

590
00:49:02,720 --> 00:49:04,680
It's Julia's car.

591
00:50:10,040 --> 00:50:11,480
My leg.

592
00:50:12,640 --> 00:50:14,040
Wait, wait!

593
00:50:14,480 --> 00:50:16,600
- Julia!
- I'm okay. Find the cabin.

594
00:50:16,760 --> 00:50:18,960
I've got the translations.

595
00:50:30,200 --> 00:50:31,720
How you feeling?

596
00:50:32,280 --> 00:50:33,760
- I'm terrified.
- You need to rest?

597
00:50:33,920 --> 00:50:36,280
No, no, let's keep going.

598
00:50:37,720 --> 00:50:39,800
- Is that Wil?
- What?

599
00:50:39,960 --> 00:50:41,600
- Stay here.
- No, no, John...

600
00:50:41,760 --> 00:50:43,480
I said, stay here!

601
00:50:52,120 --> 00:50:53,080
John!

602
00:50:56,200 --> 00:50:59,000
- John! Run!
- Marjorie!

603
00:51:59,320 --> 00:52:03,240
<i>Saint Francis could see beauty
where others couldn't. </i>

604
00:53:40,280 --> 00:53:44,080
I'm Father Sanchez. I can help you.

605
00:53:48,440 --> 00:53:51,040
I remember you
from a photograph I saw.

606
00:53:51,200 --> 00:53:52,680
You and Father Jose.

607
00:53:52,840 --> 00:53:55,640
Don't forget Wil. He was also there.

608
00:53:55,800 --> 00:53:58,880
Wil told me if I needed help,
someone would show up.

609
00:53:59,880 --> 00:54:01,760
I guess he meant you.

610
00:54:05,600 --> 00:54:08,080
Tell me what happened
on the cliffs, John.

611
00:54:10,080 --> 00:54:12,240
I knew I was gonna die...

612
00:54:14,600 --> 00:54:16,560
...so I just let go.

613
00:54:18,680 --> 00:54:20,480
Waited for the bullets.

614
00:54:23,960 --> 00:54:27,280
Then everything
began to change and I felt this...

615
00:54:27,720 --> 00:54:29,560
You had an amazing experience,
my friend.

616
00:54:29,720 --> 00:54:32,680
You opened up. You are changed.

617
00:54:33,120 --> 00:54:34,520
Did Wil explain this to you?

618
00:54:36,280 --> 00:54:37,560
He tried. I couldn't get it.

619
00:54:37,720 --> 00:54:39,520
Oh, you got more than you think.

620
00:54:39,960 --> 00:54:41,720
Tell me what you know.

621
00:54:43,320 --> 00:54:45,040
You mean the insights?

622
00:54:48,760 --> 00:54:53,880
Well, the first and the second
are about noticing the coincidences.

623
00:54:54,040 --> 00:54:56,240
Things happen for a reason.

624
00:54:57,520 --> 00:55:00,280
They're waking us up,
showing us the energy.

625
00:55:00,920 --> 00:55:02,680
And that's the third
and the fourth, right?

626
00:55:02,840 --> 00:55:05,560
I mean, that it's real
and people battle for it.

627
00:55:05,720 --> 00:55:07,640
Causes all the conflict in the world.

628
00:55:07,800 --> 00:55:09,760
Between nations,
in the workplace, families.

629
00:55:09,920 --> 00:55:11,800
There's only one solution.

630
00:55:13,280 --> 00:55:14,880
Opening up.

631
00:55:15,720 --> 00:55:17,680
Finding our own energy.

632
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:19,440
Fifth insight.

633
00:55:19,640 --> 00:55:21,400
Connects you
with the one true source:

634
00:55:21,560 --> 00:55:23,120
The real world.

635
00:55:24,280 --> 00:55:26,120
But I lost it. Why?

636
00:55:26,280 --> 00:55:27,960
Well, the prophecy says...

637
00:55:28,600 --> 00:55:31,280
...when you find this true connection
with the energy of God...

638
00:55:31,440 --> 00:55:33,720
...it's like a glimpse into the future.

639
00:55:34,200 --> 00:55:38,160
One day, we'll all see that way,
live in that world.

640
00:55:38,360 --> 00:55:41,720
But now it's a difficult thing
for anyone to maintain.

641
00:55:41,920 --> 00:55:43,840
We are evolving in that direction.

642
00:55:44,640 --> 00:55:47,080
I saw the world's evolution.

643
00:55:48,880 --> 00:55:50,960
How it all came to be.

644
00:55:51,120 --> 00:55:54,360
My life seemed to be a part
of everything, right up to now.

645
00:55:54,600 --> 00:55:58,080
Everything made sense.
Growing up at the lake...

646
00:55:58,760 --> 00:56:01,200
...working with kids,
trying to understand history.

647
00:56:01,400 --> 00:56:03,480
I spent my life
thinking there was something more.

648
00:56:03,640 --> 00:56:08,120
That's the sixth insight. It says we are
part of a larger flow of evolution.

649
00:56:08,280 --> 00:56:09,920
We are here to do something.

650
00:56:10,080 --> 00:56:12,080
And if we are true to that purpose...

651
00:56:12,240 --> 00:56:15,000
...we'll help move humanity
towards the world you saw.

652
00:56:15,160 --> 00:56:17,080
But I don't know
what I'm supposed to do.

653
00:56:17,240 --> 00:56:19,000
That's because
you're not through yet.

654
00:56:20,200 --> 00:56:22,960
How to know what to do next
is the seventh.

655
00:56:24,280 --> 00:56:26,120
You have to discover your guidance.

656
00:56:28,760 --> 00:56:30,040
You're talking about hunches?

657
00:56:31,880 --> 00:56:33,520
Intuitions? I've seen Wil have those.

658
00:56:33,720 --> 00:56:37,040
If you stay alert,
you'll notice certain ideas...

659
00:56:37,200 --> 00:56:38,760
...images coming into your mind.

660
00:56:38,920 --> 00:56:40,840
They're there to guide you.

661
00:56:41,240 --> 00:56:44,400
Follow them and the coincidences
begin to increase.

662
00:56:44,560 --> 00:56:46,280
Just step into the flow.

663
00:56:46,440 --> 00:56:48,640
I don't think I've ever
experienced that before.

664
00:56:48,800 --> 00:56:51,880
You just need to open the door again.
Get some more energy.

665
00:56:52,040 --> 00:56:53,680
You remember
how you felt on the cliff?

666
00:56:53,840 --> 00:56:55,000
How the world looked?

667
00:56:56,320 --> 00:56:58,480
Just breathe in the memory.

668
00:57:18,160 --> 00:57:19,960
You were daydreaming.

669
00:57:20,920 --> 00:57:22,880
Yeah, I guess I was.

670
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:25,720
What was coming to you?

671
00:57:28,120 --> 00:57:30,320
I was thinking about Marjorie.

672
00:57:31,240 --> 00:57:33,800
How it's my fault
that she got captured.

673
00:57:34,400 --> 00:57:36,280
What all were you seeing?

674
00:57:37,400 --> 00:57:39,960
- I don't know.
- No, come on, think.

675
00:57:40,120 --> 00:57:42,040
Most people
overlook these experiences.

676
00:57:43,840 --> 00:57:46,960
Well, it's the same thing
I saw yesterday on the mountain.

677
00:57:47,320 --> 00:57:49,320
And it felt like the future.

678
00:57:52,720 --> 00:57:58,200
She was in this place,
surrounded by dense jungle.

679
00:57:59,240 --> 00:58:00,680
Go on.

680
00:58:01,360 --> 00:58:03,440
Well, she was looking at something.

681
00:58:04,760 --> 00:58:07,480
A small flower.
A small yellow flower.

682
00:58:08,080 --> 00:58:09,720
Well, that's clear enough.

683
00:58:11,160 --> 00:58:12,760
Yeah, clear as mud.

684
00:58:12,920 --> 00:58:14,480
You know you have to do something.

685
00:58:14,680 --> 00:58:16,120
Except you don't know what.

686
00:58:16,280 --> 00:58:17,840
Then you have
this image of Marjorie.

687
00:58:18,040 --> 00:58:21,360
Well, that little daydream of yours
was a guidance.

688
00:58:22,520 --> 00:58:24,720
Okay. I'll buy that.

689
00:58:26,560 --> 00:58:28,320
What's it saying?

690
00:58:29,160 --> 00:58:31,360
You saw her in the rain forest?

691
00:58:32,760 --> 00:58:36,760
Well, the rain forest is that way.

692
00:58:37,600 --> 00:58:40,240
I don't know if I should do this.
Maybe I should go with you.

693
00:58:40,440 --> 00:58:42,400
There's no need. I can find Julia.

694
00:58:42,560 --> 00:58:47,400
You have to go your own way.
Follow your own intuition alone.

695
00:58:47,560 --> 00:58:50,360
We can't do anything without Marjorie,
so get moving. Find her.

696
00:58:50,520 --> 00:58:51,800
I'll see you at Miguel's cabin.

697
00:58:51,960 --> 00:58:53,720
Find her?
I don't know where I'm going!

698
00:58:53,880 --> 00:58:57,400
None of us know where we're going.
Not really. Just listen inside.

699
00:58:57,560 --> 00:59:01,800
Pay attention to the way things look.
Something will happen.

700
01:00:17,040 --> 01:00:20,280
Father Jose?
We thought you were dead.

701
01:00:20,440 --> 01:00:24,800
Well, things are not always
as they seem, John.

702
01:00:26,120 --> 01:00:29,880
I thought I was on the right path.
I guess I made a mistake.

703
01:00:30,040 --> 01:00:32,920
<i>It's a mistake
to think the worst too quickly.</i>

704
01:00:33,080 --> 01:00:37,480
Always find the deeper meaning,
the silver lining.

705
01:00:38,520 --> 01:00:41,160
That's what keeps you in the flow.

706
01:01:37,280 --> 01:01:39,760
- Marjorie.
- John.

707
01:01:42,760 --> 01:01:46,360
I don't know how this is happening.
It's just...

708
01:01:49,240 --> 01:01:50,320
Don't worry.

709
01:01:50,680 --> 01:01:53,120
- We're gonna get out of here.
- Okay.

710
01:03:00,880 --> 01:03:04,560
Okay. What now?

711
01:04:11,080 --> 01:04:12,920
This is it.

712
01:04:15,240 --> 01:04:16,400
Thank you.

713
01:04:19,760 --> 01:04:21,080
Okay.

714
01:04:27,960 --> 01:04:29,680
Okay.

715
01:04:32,400 --> 01:04:35,200
All right, I've been to Miguel's cabin
once before and I...

716
01:04:38,680 --> 01:04:40,640
Wanna know what I think?

717
01:04:40,920 --> 01:04:44,080
I think we should make for the border
and get out of Peru while we can.

718
01:04:44,240 --> 01:04:45,720
Have you forgotten why we're here?

719
01:04:45,880 --> 01:04:49,080
We could try to contact the others
when we get there. No more shooting.

720
01:04:49,240 --> 01:04:52,440
John, you're past this.
Listen to yourself.

721
01:04:52,600 --> 01:04:54,720
Now, I promise you,
I can find this place.

722
01:04:54,880 --> 01:04:56,880
You just give me a minute, all right?

723
01:04:59,800 --> 01:05:01,360
- No.
- Hold on.

724
01:05:01,520 --> 01:05:03,160
- It's too dangerous. Marjorie.
- Hold on.

725
01:05:03,320 --> 01:05:05,840
- Will you talk to me, please?
- You don't wanna talk.

726
01:05:06,040 --> 01:05:09,120
To talk, you'd have to actually listen
to what another person is feeling.

727
01:05:09,280 --> 01:05:11,040
- You're dense as a post.
- I'm trying to...

728
01:05:11,200 --> 01:05:13,400
You're controlling, John,
because you're scared...

729
01:05:13,560 --> 01:05:15,840
...and it's wearing me down.
It can't happen anymore.

730
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:20,000
Not if I can help it. L...
John. Leave me alone.

731
01:06:01,520 --> 01:06:04,280
Hey, what took you so long?
Julia! They're here.

732
01:06:04,440 --> 01:06:05,800
You did it.

733
01:06:09,680 --> 01:06:13,200
- What's going on?
- Oh, it's okay. Don't ask.

734
01:06:16,760 --> 01:06:19,760
Come on, John, you did great.
Come on in.

735
01:06:38,680 --> 01:06:41,480
Come on, give me another chance.

736
01:06:43,440 --> 01:06:46,000
You're the one that's supposed to be
good at all this stuff.

737
01:06:46,200 --> 01:06:50,080
You are not making this easy on me.
I am doing the best I can...

738
01:06:50,240 --> 01:06:51,920
...but I don't have it figured out yet.

739
01:06:52,080 --> 01:06:54,840
You can start by calming down.

740
01:06:59,960 --> 01:07:02,840
I can be a little
hard-edged sometimes.

741
01:07:06,280 --> 01:07:08,400
I've always gotten lost
in other people.

742
01:07:08,560 --> 01:07:11,520
Guys. Mostly the charming ones.

743
01:07:11,680 --> 01:07:14,760
Not stood my ground
when it was really important...

744
01:07:14,920 --> 01:07:16,560
...and I vowed to myself,
not anymore...

745
01:07:16,760 --> 01:07:20,440
...and then you come along,
like it's some kind of test for me, and...

746
01:07:20,800 --> 01:07:26,200
...I just get angry because I don't
wanna slide backwards, John.

747
01:07:26,360 --> 01:07:27,800
Neither do I.

748
01:07:28,280 --> 01:07:31,480
That's why I wanna find out exactly
what happened and get through this.

749
01:07:32,640 --> 01:07:35,200
The couple thing is the hardest thing
to work out.

750
01:07:35,360 --> 01:07:37,280
Especially if the relationship
is familiar...

751
01:07:37,440 --> 01:07:39,800
...if it feels
like I've known you before.

752
01:07:43,920 --> 01:07:46,040
Did you think I didn't feel it?

753
01:07:53,960 --> 01:07:57,840
When couples first meet, usually
there is this wonderful feeling...

754
01:07:58,000 --> 01:07:59,960
...but it almost never lasts.

755
01:08:00,480 --> 01:08:02,640
One person gets insecure
and starts controlling...

756
01:08:02,800 --> 01:08:05,280
...wanting more
from the other person, and...

757
01:08:05,440 --> 01:08:10,520
...the other one gets threatened
and backs away...

758
01:08:10,680 --> 01:08:14,160
...and it leads to a power struggle.
- It doesn't have to be that way.

759
01:08:16,960 --> 01:08:18,680
No, it doesn't.

760
01:08:19,640 --> 01:08:21,280
I mean...

761
01:08:22,480 --> 01:08:24,520
...if both people stay connected...

762
01:08:24,680 --> 01:08:27,680
...then whoever has
the strongest intuition leads...

763
01:08:27,840 --> 01:08:31,320
...and there's no competition.

764
01:08:31,840 --> 01:08:34,520
Control is shared,
and that's the relationship I want.

765
01:08:34,680 --> 01:08:37,600
That's just it,
I can't stay connected.

766
01:08:40,080 --> 01:08:43,400
I want to, but I'm not there yet.

767
01:08:43,960 --> 01:08:45,600
But there is a way, John.

768
01:08:45,760 --> 01:08:48,920
And we all have to work on
doing this one critical thing.

769
01:08:49,080 --> 01:08:52,560
It's what I need to remember
instead of getting angry all the time.

770
01:08:54,640 --> 01:08:57,360
I mean, that's the eighth insight.

771
01:08:58,920 --> 01:09:00,080
Come here.

772
01:09:02,520 --> 01:09:08,280
It says that instead of taking energy
from each other, you give it.

773
01:09:08,440 --> 01:09:11,440
All the time, no matter what.

774
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:17,440
Like Father Sanchez is doing.

775
01:09:18,840 --> 01:09:20,360
Look at him, John.

776
01:09:21,240 --> 01:09:23,040
Really look.

777
01:09:33,160 --> 01:09:35,480
Giving energy is a process.

778
01:09:35,640 --> 01:09:38,720
When someone's energy increases,
you can see it in their expression.

779
01:09:39,160 --> 01:09:41,480
So you look
for that higher expression.

780
01:09:41,640 --> 01:09:43,760
And in every situation...

781
01:09:43,920 --> 01:09:48,080
...you know your energy is moving
into them when you get a feeling.

782
01:09:48,880 --> 01:09:50,040
A feeling?

783
01:09:50,200 --> 01:09:54,320
On the cliff, when you opened up,
remember? What did you feel?

784
01:09:56,120 --> 01:09:59,400
I felt a kind of completeness.

785
01:09:59,920 --> 01:10:01,840
A wholeness. This...

786
01:10:03,400 --> 01:10:05,720
This unmatched euphoria.

787
01:10:07,720 --> 01:10:09,800
- You're talking about love, aren't you?
- Yes.

788
01:10:10,440 --> 01:10:12,720
Giving is the secret
to keeping yourself connected...

789
01:10:12,880 --> 01:10:15,160
...because your energy, your love...

790
01:10:15,400 --> 01:10:18,560
...builds up in you first
as it flows out to others.

791
01:10:18,720 --> 01:10:21,440
It's what the saints
have always known how to do.

792
01:10:21,880 --> 01:10:24,480
It's what you and I have to do now
to help them.

793
01:10:43,080 --> 01:10:44,800
Wait a minute.

794
01:10:46,080 --> 01:10:48,000
Maybe we're misreading this.

795
01:10:48,160 --> 01:10:49,760
Father Sanchez, John, come here.

796
01:10:49,920 --> 01:10:52,400
I found something
in the translations.

797
01:10:52,600 --> 01:10:55,920
Look at this. This phrase:

798
01:10:58,920 --> 01:11:02,760
- What does it mean?
- It means, roughly, to amplify.

799
01:11:02,960 --> 01:11:06,960
I thought it just referred to one person
giving energy to another.

800
01:11:07,560 --> 01:11:09,760
But now I think it's something more.

801
01:11:12,320 --> 01:11:15,440
<i>It's one thing to just give energy... </i>

802
01:11:15,600 --> 01:11:19,480
<i>... but if we give it to someone
who is also giving it back... </i>

803
01:11:19,640 --> 01:11:23,440
<i>... then we build energy
among ourselves. </i>

804
01:11:24,600 --> 01:11:28,280
<i>It amplifies, back and forth. </i>

805
01:11:31,480 --> 01:11:33,600
<i>It says if we were all doing this... </i>

806
01:11:33,760 --> 01:11:36,800
<i>... humanity would take another step
in evolution. </i>

807
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:45,200
Does it say where we'll go?

808
01:11:45,960 --> 01:11:48,880
<i>Maybe that's what the ninth
is going to tell us. </i>

809
01:11:54,320 --> 01:11:57,680
That's it. Isn't it?

810
01:11:59,800 --> 01:12:01,960
That's where it's gonna happen.

811
01:12:18,880 --> 01:12:20,560
Hey, John, we have to get going.

812
01:12:25,960 --> 01:12:28,400
It'll take about two hours
to get to the ruins from here.

813
01:12:28,560 --> 01:12:30,920
Does anyone know
exactly where to start looking?

814
01:12:35,040 --> 01:12:37,400
There's someone who knows
exactly where to look.

815
01:13:42,240 --> 01:13:45,520
You got it all, John.
All the prophecy that we know.

816
01:13:45,680 --> 01:13:47,240
You've caught up.

817
01:13:54,840 --> 01:13:57,120
Now you live in our world.

818
01:14:13,920 --> 01:14:18,320
You could just let it go.
You don't owe anything to anyone.

819
01:14:19,960 --> 01:14:23,320
No, you go ahead.
I'll catch up with you.

820
01:14:26,200 --> 01:14:28,360
I think I have to go with him.

821
01:14:36,280 --> 01:14:39,920
- So why have you come here?
- To seek reconciliation.

822
01:14:40,080 --> 01:14:41,920
I want you to understand
the course I chose.

823
01:14:42,080 --> 01:14:45,680
There's nothing to understand.
All this talk about prophecy must end.

824
01:14:45,840 --> 01:14:47,880
The people have the right
to know what it says.

825
01:14:48,280 --> 01:14:51,400
It makes our religion,
it makes every religion, come alive.

826
01:14:51,880 --> 01:14:53,040
- Really?
- Of course.

827
01:14:53,240 --> 01:14:56,400
- Look what it's done to us.
- Hear me, please.

828
01:15:00,640 --> 01:15:05,240
From the time of Peter, the Church
has been about faith, about belief.

829
01:15:05,400 --> 01:15:08,000
We have kept that belief alive.

830
01:15:08,360 --> 01:15:10,600
But we can go past that now.

831
01:15:10,920 --> 01:15:14,280
We can begin to live the promises.
The kingdom can come now.

832
01:15:14,440 --> 01:15:16,000
It can all lead to chaos.

833
01:15:16,160 --> 01:15:19,240
No. The guidance inside
will prevent that.

834
01:15:19,400 --> 01:15:22,440
The perception can expand
and evolve.

835
01:15:22,880 --> 01:15:24,560
Evolve?

836
01:15:25,400 --> 01:15:27,680
Listen carefully
to what you are saying.

837
01:15:27,840 --> 01:15:30,800
We have always fought
against the idea of evolution.

838
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:34,120
Against the idea
of evolution without God.

839
01:15:34,280 --> 01:15:38,040
But evolution is a creation
that's still happening.

840
01:15:38,200 --> 01:15:39,760
We can all participate.

841
01:15:39,960 --> 01:15:42,640
Don't lecture me about theology!

842
01:15:44,560 --> 01:15:46,920
Only God creates, not us.

843
01:15:47,080 --> 01:15:49,680
But it happens through us,
don't you see?

844
01:15:52,760 --> 01:15:55,320
You protected
the Franciscan documents.

845
01:15:55,480 --> 01:15:57,080
You showed us
where the scrolls were.

846
01:15:57,640 --> 01:16:00,280
They were placed in the ruins
for some reason.

847
01:16:00,440 --> 01:16:02,320
It's time to find out why.

848
01:16:02,640 --> 01:16:04,960
Please, join us.

849
01:16:07,120 --> 01:16:10,840
No. It must end.

850
01:16:11,320 --> 01:16:13,320
It doesn't matter now.

851
01:16:15,560 --> 01:16:20,600
There will be no ruins,
be no ninth insight. Nothing.

852
01:16:21,440 --> 01:16:23,000
What have you done?

853
01:16:23,760 --> 01:16:24,880
It's over.

854
01:16:25,680 --> 01:16:27,720
It's out of our hands now.

855
01:16:45,840 --> 01:16:47,400
Come on.
We need to find the others.

856
01:16:47,560 --> 01:16:50,680
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
It's Jensen.

857
01:16:52,360 --> 01:16:54,160
We gotta get moving.

858
01:16:54,920 --> 01:16:57,840
Remember you told me
I need to follow my own intuition?

859
01:17:01,640 --> 01:17:03,480
This is mine to do.

860
01:17:33,480 --> 01:17:35,080
So where's the ninth scroll?

861
01:17:39,440 --> 01:17:43,440
You should have come with me before,
when I gave you the chance.

862
01:17:44,120 --> 01:17:47,080
You're gonna destroy the ruins.
Aren't you?

863
01:17:47,680 --> 01:17:49,680
Let's just say
there are people out there...

864
01:17:49,840 --> 01:17:51,920
...who want certain things
to happen.

865
01:17:52,080 --> 01:17:54,400
Your prophecy isn't one of them.

866
01:17:54,640 --> 01:17:56,280
How did you think
this would end, huh?

867
01:17:56,440 --> 01:17:58,880
If you only knew
what the prophecy says...

868
01:17:59,040 --> 01:18:00,280
...how the world really is...

869
01:18:00,440 --> 01:18:02,880
The world is the way it is
because we make it that way.

870
01:18:03,040 --> 01:18:05,880
When there's prosperity, we create it.
When there's war...

871
01:18:06,040 --> 01:18:07,960
...well, sometimes war
can be useful too.

872
01:18:08,960 --> 01:18:12,400
- You wanna destroy this democracy?
- Not destroy.

873
01:18:12,560 --> 01:18:14,120
Limit.

874
01:18:14,280 --> 01:18:17,160
Progress depends
on people's willingness to be led.

875
01:18:17,880 --> 01:18:19,280
The world has changed.

876
01:18:19,480 --> 01:18:21,520
Religious fanatics
are threatening everything.

877
01:18:21,720 --> 01:18:24,920
Now this prophecy pops up again
after hundreds of years.

878
01:18:26,560 --> 01:18:29,880
Oh, yes. I know all about it.

879
01:18:30,040 --> 01:18:31,600
We have our writings too.

880
01:18:31,800 --> 01:18:34,000
We've always known the dangers
of what it promises.

881
01:18:34,160 --> 01:18:37,680
This dreamy liberation.
The illusion of security.

882
01:18:37,840 --> 01:18:39,080
It undermines everything.

883
01:18:39,240 --> 01:18:42,960
It's not an illusion. It's real.
It's the only thing that's real.

884
01:18:43,720 --> 01:18:46,040
Trying to control isn't the answer.

885
01:18:46,200 --> 01:18:48,600
When we find
the true God experience...

886
01:18:48,760 --> 01:18:52,000
...the fight over whose religion
is best, it fades.

887
01:18:52,880 --> 01:18:57,200
- There's just one truth.
- You people, so naive.

888
01:18:57,360 --> 01:19:00,880
Thinking there's something spiritual
guiding this world.

889
01:19:01,240 --> 01:19:04,120
Well, there's nothing out there.

890
01:19:04,280 --> 01:19:05,720
Just us humans.

891
01:19:05,880 --> 01:19:09,080
And those of us who know that
will always be in control.

892
01:19:12,240 --> 01:19:14,640
The way of this world...

893
01:19:15,840 --> 01:19:17,520
...is power.

894
01:19:24,120 --> 01:19:27,840
- Can't let you do this.
- You could never stop me.

895
01:19:33,880 --> 01:19:36,880
You idiot! You have killed us all!

896
01:20:12,840 --> 01:20:16,560
John, I found the others.
Let's get to the circle.

897
01:20:18,520 --> 01:20:20,560
I'll be right back.

898
01:20:25,720 --> 01:20:27,640
You feel that?

899
01:20:29,080 --> 01:20:30,800
It's happening.

900
01:20:36,760 --> 01:20:38,720
Someone's helping us.

901
01:20:40,760 --> 01:20:45,440
Send the energy back. It will build.
Remember?

902
01:21:02,400 --> 01:21:03,800
Oh, my...

903
01:21:05,160 --> 01:21:07,480
How incredible is this?

904
01:21:10,960 --> 01:21:12,760
I can read it.

905
01:21:14,440 --> 01:21:16,640
I can read this. It says:

906
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:21,800
"The guidance within
evolves the world towards a...

907
01:21:21,960 --> 01:21:24,280
Towards a heaven
that is already here.

908
01:21:24,440 --> 01:21:27,480
To know this
is to know our destiny."

909
01:22:00,560 --> 01:22:03,800
- Wil?
- You made it here first.

910
01:22:04,120 --> 01:22:06,000
Wherever this is.

911
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:08,720
You were helping us, weren't you?

912
01:22:09,080 --> 01:22:12,120
- Father Jose.
- He's been helping us too.

913
01:22:19,160 --> 01:22:21,200
They're all helping us.

914
01:22:21,600 --> 01:22:23,160
We are being shown heaven.

915
01:22:34,360 --> 01:22:36,480
It's where evolution is taking us.

916
01:22:36,640 --> 01:22:39,160
Where it's always been taking us.

917
01:22:43,160 --> 01:22:45,440
That's the ninth insight.

918
01:22:46,720 --> 01:22:49,320
No! Don't hurt her,
she's just a child.

919
01:22:50,120 --> 01:22:53,160
No, keep your energy.
Hold on, they'll see you.

920
01:22:54,040 --> 01:22:55,240
Julia.

921
01:22:59,920 --> 01:23:01,600
Stay focused. Keep your energy.

922
01:23:03,680 --> 01:23:05,160
John.

923
01:23:25,760 --> 01:23:28,240
Take them to the ridge!

924
01:24:03,640 --> 01:24:06,400
Marjorie? I wanna
tell you something.

925
01:24:06,560 --> 01:24:08,880
I don't think we have much time left.

926
01:24:09,640 --> 01:24:13,800
But I wanna thank you for all of it,
for everything you've shown me.

927
01:24:14,160 --> 01:24:17,040
I was a reluctant student at first,
I know, but I'm glad you...

928
01:24:17,200 --> 01:24:18,440
...didn't give up on me.

929
01:24:19,840 --> 01:24:22,280
I think I was the stubborn one.

930
01:24:24,440 --> 01:24:27,160
And, John, we weren't
supposed to be together.

931
01:24:27,320 --> 01:24:30,480
Not this time. We were just
supposed to find a balance.

932
01:24:33,480 --> 01:24:35,400
I think we did.

933
01:24:35,560 --> 01:24:36,960
Yeah.

934
01:24:53,040 --> 01:24:54,800
In the name of God. Wait!

935
01:24:55,280 --> 01:24:56,320
Lower your weapons!

936
01:24:57,840 --> 01:25:00,240
These people
can do you no harm now.

937
01:25:00,520 --> 01:25:02,840
They'll have no credibility.
I'm making sure of it.

938
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:06,400
This is not your affair,
Your Excellency.

939
01:25:06,800 --> 01:25:08,200
No.

940
01:25:12,880 --> 01:25:17,000
Let them live. We're not murderers.
The prophecy has been destroyed.

941
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:20,320
The jungle will take the ruins.

942
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:23,440
Nothing is left of this prophecy.

943
01:25:23,640 --> 01:25:25,920
The prophecy is finished.

944
01:25:32,160 --> 01:25:33,440
Take them to Lima.

945
01:26:06,040 --> 01:26:07,640
I knew it was you.

946
01:26:10,040 --> 01:26:11,640
It's pretty intense in there.

947
01:26:11,800 --> 01:26:14,960
I have 45 minutes to leave the country.
They got me on the next plane out.

948
01:26:18,880 --> 01:26:20,080
What about the others?

949
01:26:20,440 --> 01:26:21,680
Marjorie?

950
01:26:21,840 --> 01:26:23,280
She's already back home.

951
01:26:23,480 --> 01:26:25,720
She was there to set you free.

952
01:26:26,640 --> 01:26:28,800
Julia and the girl,
they're all right too.

953
01:26:31,320 --> 01:26:32,560
Wil?

954
01:26:35,040 --> 01:26:37,080
The scrolls? The translations?
Anything left?

955
01:26:37,240 --> 01:26:38,760
They don't matter, John.

956
01:26:38,920 --> 01:26:40,920
We were able
to understand the ninth.

957
01:26:41,880 --> 01:26:44,600
Now we know
what life is really about.

958
01:26:45,080 --> 01:26:47,120
That changes everything.

959
01:26:49,120 --> 01:26:50,480
Here.

960
01:26:50,880 --> 01:26:52,880
I thought you'd find this interesting.

961
01:26:55,640 --> 01:26:57,840
How about that?
We made the news.

962
01:27:00,040 --> 01:27:02,280
She sent me here.

963
01:27:03,000 --> 01:27:05,520
Maybe now you can
have something real.

964
01:27:08,920 --> 01:27:10,360
Yeah.

965
01:27:11,920 --> 01:27:13,680
Maybe I can.

966
01:27:17,240 --> 01:27:19,760
So, what are you going to do now?

967
01:27:20,520 --> 01:27:22,480
I don't know. I don't know.

968
01:27:22,680 --> 01:27:25,040
You have to take all this
with you, John.

969
01:27:25,200 --> 01:27:27,400
You'll meet others
who have to know.

970
01:27:28,600 --> 01:27:30,560
Just keep your eyes open.

971
01:27:31,560 --> 01:27:33,800
Something will always happen.

972
01:27:43,960 --> 01:27:45,360
One last thing.

973
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:48,760
Something tells me
you'll be getting a message.

974
01:27:49,720 --> 01:27:51,280
From Wil.

975
01:28:29,680 --> 01:28:31,280
Magazine?

976
01:28:31,920 --> 01:28:33,280
Thank you.

977
01:29:13,560 --> 01:29:15,000
There's a tenth insight.

978
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:21,560
There's a tenth insight.
