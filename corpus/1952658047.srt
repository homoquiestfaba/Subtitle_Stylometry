1
00:01:58,318 --> 00:02:03,620
The white zone is for immediate loading
and unloading of passengers only.

2
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:05,849
No parking.

3
00:02:06,426 --> 00:02:08,860
Hello. Wait, wait, wait.

4
00:02:09,028 --> 00:02:10,791
-Who is this?.
-Richard. Where are you?

5
00:02:10,964 --> 00:02:13,933
-What's going on?
-Richard, I ' m at the airport.

6
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:16,466
-What are you doing there?
-I'll explain later.

7
00:02:16,636 --> 00:02:18,604
I need to know
if you're doing the book.

8
00:02:18,771 --> 00:02:20,534
-Richard, I'm not--
-Where's the book?

9
00:02:20,707 --> 00:02:24,370
I'm not gonna write it. I'm not gonna--
I'm not gonna give them what they want.

10
00:02:24,544 --> 00:02:26,910
You have a contract, Jon.
You have to do it.

11
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:29,947
-Think about the contract.
-Hey, they can take the house.

12
00:02:30,116 --> 00:02:33,483
-They can sue me. I don't care.
-Grow up, Jon. Write the book.

13
00:02:35,455 --> 00:02:37,514
We'll talk about it later. I gotta go. Bye.

14
00:02:39,225 --> 00:02:43,491
I was keeping the crate here until you
claimed him. Thought he might be dangerous.

15
00:02:43,663 --> 00:02:46,097
Thanks. Devon?.

16
00:02:47,433 --> 00:02:49,162
Hey.

17
00:02:49,335 --> 00:02:51,735
Let's get a look at you, boy.

18
00:02:59,579 --> 00:03:01,843
Yeah. Hey.

19
00:03:04,651 --> 00:03:06,084
That's a leash.

20
00:03:06,586 --> 00:03:09,248
I'm gonna put this on you now.

21
00:03:09,455 --> 00:03:11,719
That's it.

22
00:03:12,125 --> 00:03:16,425
-I'm gonna open the door. I'm coming in.
-Don't open the door.

23
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:19,088
Hey!

24
00:03:20,567 --> 00:03:22,034
What?.

25
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:30,699
Would everybody please keep back?.

26
00:03:31,778 --> 00:03:33,507
I don't like dogs.

27
00:03:34,747 --> 00:03:36,977
-Excuse me, excuse me.
-Whose dog is that?.

28
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:38,845
Ma'am, ma'am, you have to stay calm.

29
00:03:39,018 --> 00:03:40,451
-ls this your dog?.
-Yes, yes.

30
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:44,613
Get a leash on him, please. All right.
If he bites someone, it is your responsibility.

31
00:03:44,958 --> 00:03:47,893
That's very helpful. I appreciate that.
Come on now, Devon.

32
00:03:48,061 --> 00:03:49,494
-Be still, ma'am.
-Sit, Devon.

33
00:03:49,662 --> 00:03:52,460
-Would everyone please step back?.
-Okay. Okay.

34
00:03:52,632 --> 00:03:54,122
-Devon, Devon, Devon.
-Sir?.

35
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:57,463
Devon, Devon, Devon.
Devon, Devon. Devon, okay.

36
00:03:57,637 --> 00:04:00,037
-Sir, you can't go up there!
-Okay.

37
00:04:00,206 --> 00:04:01,730
Come on now. Sit, Devon.

38
00:04:01,908 --> 00:04:04,308
-Devon, Devon!
-There's a dog running wild, Gate 7.

39
00:04:04,477 --> 00:04:06,445
I'm gonna need backup here.

40
00:04:08,381 --> 00:04:10,679
For security reasons,
please keep your luggage...

41
00:04:10,850 --> 00:04:14,286
...with you at all times.
Unattended luggage....

42
00:04:14,454 --> 00:04:16,081
Sorry.

43
00:04:20,693 --> 00:04:23,821
Excuse me. Devon?. Devon.

44
00:04:23,997 --> 00:04:26,465
Stay. Stay.

45
00:04:28,401 --> 00:04:30,130
Okay.

46
00:04:30,970 --> 00:04:33,165
Easy now.

47
00:04:33,339 --> 00:04:34,738
Good boy.

48
00:04:34,907 --> 00:04:37,273
It's okay. It's gonna be okay.

49
00:04:42,415 --> 00:04:44,815
I'm Jon Katz.

50
00:04:47,787 --> 00:04:49,948
I'm a writer.

51
00:04:50,723 --> 00:04:53,351
I'm 56.

52
00:04:53,626 --> 00:04:55,651
I have a bad back.

53
00:04:56,262 --> 00:04:58,321
Devon, look.

54
00:04:58,498 --> 00:05:01,558
Devon, I have a treat for you.

55
00:05:01,734 --> 00:05:03,497
Yes, I do. Look.

56
00:05:04,637 --> 00:05:05,661
Devon.

57
00:05:06,773 --> 00:05:08,638
It's good. Look. Take it.

58
00:05:10,643 --> 00:05:13,942
You know?. Not good enough
for you?. Okay.

59
00:05:15,682 --> 00:05:17,377
Stay.

60
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:19,108
Stay, Devon.

61
00:05:19,285 --> 00:05:21,116
Come here. That's a boy.

62
00:05:21,821 --> 00:05:22,879
Devon, Devon, Devon.

63
00:05:23,056 --> 00:05:24,683
Yes, good boy.
We're going home.

64
00:05:25,291 --> 00:05:26,690
Okay. Okay.

65
00:05:26,859 --> 00:05:29,453
No, no, no. We're gonna go home now.

66
00:05:29,629 --> 00:05:31,358
We're gonna go home now.

67
00:05:31,664 --> 00:05:33,256
Okay.

68
00:05:42,308 --> 00:05:44,538
Julius and Stanley
are waiting for you at home.

69
00:05:49,549 --> 00:05:52,985
I don't know what you've been through,
but I work at home.

70
00:05:53,152 --> 00:05:56,315
I'm gonna stay with you,
give you lots of walks...

71
00:05:56,489 --> 00:06:00,186
...Iots of food, lots of patience.

72
00:06:04,330 --> 00:06:05,661
Come on.

73
00:06:07,233 --> 00:06:09,394
Stanley?. Julius?.

74
00:06:11,871 --> 00:06:13,532
Here he is, guys.

75
00:06:15,742 --> 00:06:17,733
That's Stanley and Julius.

76
00:06:19,312 --> 00:06:20,939
All right, get back. Coming in.

77
00:06:29,722 --> 00:06:32,623
No, no, no. Come on. Come here.

78
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:38,055
Come here. Let me see.
Come here, come here, come here.

79
00:06:38,231 --> 00:06:41,564
Let me see. That's a boy. Okay.

80
00:06:47,473 --> 00:06:49,532
Yeah.

81
00:06:50,009 --> 00:06:51,977
Okay.

82
00:06:52,912 --> 00:06:55,710
Yeah. That's a boy.

83
00:06:55,882 --> 00:06:57,543
Hey!

84
00:07:01,554 --> 00:07:03,351
Hey, hey, hey!

85
00:07:04,724 --> 00:07:06,521
What are you doing?.

86
00:07:06,692 --> 00:07:09,252
This is Emma's room.
She's away at college.

87
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:11,124
Come on. Hey, hey, hey.

88
00:07:15,234 --> 00:07:18,169
Are you--?. You looking
for the missus of the house?.

89
00:07:18,337 --> 00:07:20,737
Tough luck, pal. She's gone.

90
00:07:20,907 --> 00:07:24,070
Come on. Come on.

91
00:07:27,747 --> 00:07:29,578
Come here, come here, come here.

92
00:07:29,749 --> 00:07:31,080
Come here!

93
00:07:35,121 --> 00:07:37,783
-Don't even think about it.
-Jon?.

94
00:07:39,525 --> 00:07:42,961
-Who do we have here?.
-This is Devon, the dog from hell.

95
00:07:43,129 --> 00:07:45,154
Where did you get him?.

96
00:07:47,099 --> 00:07:49,192
This breeder in Texas.

97
00:07:49,368 --> 00:07:52,303
She read one of my books where
I mentioned Julius and Stanley...

98
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:54,269
...thought I could help this dog.

99
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:59,309
She tells me that she's
rescuing this abused dog...

100
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:01,674
...and needs a home
for him and, you know...

101
00:08:01,848 --> 00:08:03,509
...I said yes. I don't know--

102
00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:05,574
What was I thinking?.

103
00:08:05,751 --> 00:08:07,776
Come here. Come here.

104
00:08:08,154 --> 00:08:10,088
Go to town.

105
00:08:17,129 --> 00:08:18,460
So how are you doing?.

106
00:08:19,465 --> 00:08:23,026
You know, I'm-- I'm alone,
my back is killing me. I'm fine.

107
00:08:23,202 --> 00:08:25,727
It's the dog that's the problem.

108
00:08:29,342 --> 00:08:30,969
His eyes are infected.

109
00:08:31,277 --> 00:08:35,043
-His breath is foul.
-Tell me about it.

110
00:08:35,648 --> 00:08:37,912
Got abrasions on his back.

111
00:08:40,119 --> 00:08:43,179
-He has one back here too.
-Yep. Abrasions on his right hind leg.

112
00:08:43,356 --> 00:08:45,790
He's got two on his left hind leg.

113
00:08:45,958 --> 00:08:48,188
You see how his back
is hunched and crooked?.

114
00:08:48,361 --> 00:08:51,694
Some of his nails are broken.
I've seen that condition before in dogs...

115
00:08:51,864 --> 00:08:54,765
...who have been locked in cages
for months at a time.

116
00:08:56,102 --> 00:08:57,797
Devon?.

117
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:01,473
You know when I see that?.

118
00:09:02,174 --> 00:09:05,405
I see that when a dog
has been beaten by his owner.

119
00:09:05,578 --> 00:09:09,070
That's why he's pissed off.
He's pissed off at the world.

120
00:09:09,248 --> 00:09:11,216
Okay, Devon. Let's give you a bath.

121
00:09:25,498 --> 00:09:27,295
Read these.

122
00:09:31,837 --> 00:09:34,032
""This is a tireless, high-energy breed.""

123
00:09:34,373 --> 00:09:36,568
Tell me about it.

124
00:09:36,976 --> 00:09:42,141
""Without meaningful work, border collies
will become bored and depressed...

125
00:09:42,348 --> 00:09:44,714
...and may develop behavior problems.""

126
00:09:44,884 --> 00:09:46,909
Join the club.

127
00:09:49,922 --> 00:09:52,117
""Border collies have been
bred for centuries...

128
00:09:52,291 --> 00:09:55,317
...to chase things that move.""

129
00:09:59,565 --> 00:10:02,193
Says you're supposed
to be intelligent.

130
00:10:03,536 --> 00:10:05,197
Trainable?.

131
00:10:05,371 --> 00:10:06,963
Well...

132
00:10:07,573 --> 00:10:09,404
...we'll see, huh?.

133
00:10:13,145 --> 00:10:14,669
Come on.

134
00:10:15,348 --> 00:10:17,316
Attaboy.

135
00:10:17,683 --> 00:10:20,516
Okay, okay, okay.
Come here, come here.

136
00:10:22,989 --> 00:10:26,584
-Oh, Max, you have got to see this.
-Let's go, let's go.

137
00:10:27,126 --> 00:10:28,616
Slow down. Devon.

138
00:10:32,932 --> 00:10:35,400
Why would Jon Katz
want to get a new dog?.

139
00:10:35,568 --> 00:10:37,001
Come on.

140
00:10:40,439 --> 00:10:43,033
Come on, come on, come on.

141
00:10:43,909 --> 00:10:45,433
All right, all right.

142
00:10:45,611 --> 00:10:48,239
All right, this isn't working.
Come on, come on, come on.

143
00:10:48,414 --> 00:10:49,676
Devon.

144
00:10:50,116 --> 00:10:51,481
All right, get in there.

145
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:53,710
Come here. Get around,
get around. Come here.

146
00:10:53,886 --> 00:10:55,478
Sit now. Sit. Let me see.

147
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:57,816
Okay, come on.

148
00:10:58,991 --> 00:11:01,152
All right, all right. All right.

149
00:11:01,327 --> 00:11:03,625
Come on, come on.

150
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,561
Jon, you got a new dog.

151
00:11:12,238 --> 00:11:14,229
Come on, come on, come on.
Just keep moving.

152
00:11:14,407 --> 00:11:15,806
We don't wanna talk to anyone.

153
00:11:15,975 --> 00:11:21,242
-Seriously, what are you gonna do with him?.
-Seriously, Margo, I don't know.

154
00:11:23,816 --> 00:11:26,546
Come here, come here, come here.
Hey. Devon.

155
00:11:28,354 --> 00:11:29,582
No! Devon!

156
00:11:29,755 --> 00:11:31,484
Devon, no!

157
00:11:33,059 --> 00:11:34,890
Shit. Devon.

158
00:11:36,028 --> 00:11:38,292
Hey! Hey!

159
00:11:38,464 --> 00:11:40,056
Devon!

160
00:11:43,569 --> 00:11:45,560
Stop!

161
00:11:45,738 --> 00:11:47,831
Devon!

162
00:11:48,974 --> 00:11:50,805
Stop!

163
00:11:52,011 --> 00:11:53,740
Stop!

164
00:11:53,913 --> 00:11:56,381
Devon! Stop!

165
00:11:57,750 --> 00:11:58,774
Stop!

166
00:11:58,951 --> 00:12:01,613
There's a weird old man
running after us.

167
00:12:02,188 --> 00:12:04,122
Stop!

168
00:12:05,491 --> 00:12:07,516
Devon!

169
00:12:09,295 --> 00:12:10,592
What the hell are you doing?.

170
00:12:12,431 --> 00:12:15,457
What the hell are you doing?.

171
00:12:15,634 --> 00:12:17,226
Come here.

172
00:12:19,905 --> 00:12:22,203
How did you do that?.

173
00:12:31,884 --> 00:12:34,546
One new message.

174
00:12:35,254 --> 00:12:39,122
Hi, Jon. It's me.
Just leaving another message.

175
00:12:40,025 --> 00:12:42,585
I got a call from Margo
saying we got a new dog.

176
00:12:42,762 --> 00:12:44,787
Is that true?

177
00:12:46,198 --> 00:12:48,632
I'm trying to give you some space
so you can write...

178
00:12:48,801 --> 00:12:52,032
...but that means
you actually have to write.

179
00:12:52,738 --> 00:12:57,107
I don 't think you have any idea what it's
like living with you. You just check out.

180
00:12:57,276 --> 00:12:59,710
And I can 't have
a relationship on my own.

181
00:12:59,879 --> 00:13:01,972
It's too lonely.

182
00:13:03,115 --> 00:13:06,607
Have you even changed
your clothes, Jon?

183
00:13:07,586 --> 00:13:09,645
Is there anything in the fridge?

184
00:13:09,822 --> 00:13:11,881
Would you call me?

185
00:13:12,558 --> 00:13:15,356
My sister sends her love.

186
00:13:21,133 --> 00:13:23,795
Cleanup in Aisle 6.

187
00:13:37,616 --> 00:13:40,380
Hey, Jon.

188
00:13:41,787 --> 00:13:44,085
-No time like the present, right?.
-Okay.

189
00:13:44,256 --> 00:13:46,417
-Maybe you should talk to him now.
-Okay.

190
00:13:46,592 --> 00:13:48,321
Go ahead.

191
00:13:59,271 --> 00:14:01,637
-Hey, Jon, can I talk to you a minute?.
-No, no, no.

192
00:14:01,807 --> 00:14:04,275
I've got a lot of
experience with dogs.

193
00:14:04,443 --> 00:14:06,138
Max has won six blue ribbons.

194
00:14:06,312 --> 00:14:08,576
I don't care how many ribbons
your dog has won.

195
00:14:08,747 --> 00:14:11,045
We have been watching
the way you walk your dog...

196
00:14:11,217 --> 00:14:12,809
...and we're trying to help you.

197
00:14:12,985 --> 00:14:15,852
And we're trying to keep
the neighborhood safe. Jon.

198
00:14:16,021 --> 00:14:19,650
Jon, you have got to do something
about your dog. I would like to help you.

199
00:14:20,793 --> 00:14:24,729
I could come over
and give you some training tips.

200
00:14:24,897 --> 00:14:26,660
Anytime.

201
00:14:38,844 --> 00:14:41,438
My little baby.

202
00:14:42,514 --> 00:14:45,176
Did you miss your mommy?.

203
00:14:46,619 --> 00:14:48,416
Hello, Devon.

204
00:14:50,956 --> 00:14:52,890
There you go, there you go.

205
00:14:56,028 --> 00:14:58,121
What's the matter?. No pee-pee?.

206
00:15:02,735 --> 00:15:05,033
Devon, Devon! Enough now.

207
00:15:05,204 --> 00:15:06,865
-Come on now.
-Damn you, Jon.

208
00:15:07,039 --> 00:15:09,473
-That dog is dangerous.
-Devon, come on. Come on now.

209
00:15:09,642 --> 00:15:13,100
Bad boy, Devon. Bad boy.

210
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:16,612
That's a doggy. Okay. Okay.

211
00:15:45,644 --> 00:15:48,670
I have...

212
00:15:48,847 --> 00:15:54,183
...absolutely no idea.

213
00:16:11,136 --> 00:16:12,535
Oh, God.

214
00:16:18,377 --> 00:16:20,208
Jeez.

215
00:16:39,531 --> 00:16:42,056
Oh, come on.

216
00:16:43,202 --> 00:16:44,965
What?.

217
00:16:45,404 --> 00:16:47,497
No, no! How--?.

218
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:51,837
Come here.
How did you get up there, huh?.

219
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:54,377
All right, I'm impressed.

220
00:16:55,814 --> 00:16:57,509
Come here. Hey.

221
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:03,683
Devon?.

222
00:17:05,758 --> 00:17:07,885
I know, you're afraid.

223
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:10,153
Are you hungry?.

224
00:17:13,065 --> 00:17:14,327
Come on.

225
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:16,627
I know. I'm not going to hurt you.

226
00:17:16,802 --> 00:17:18,326
You gotta be brave.

227
00:17:27,913 --> 00:17:29,710
What are you doing?.

228
00:18:25,037 --> 00:18:27,437
Hey, Dad, it's me. Are you there?

229
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:30,005
Mom 's been having trouble
reaching you...

230
00:18:30,175 --> 00:18:34,339
...so I wanted to call.
I heard you got a new dog?

231
00:18:34,513 --> 00:18:37,038
I'll be coming home this weekend
to pick up some stuff.

232
00:18:37,216 --> 00:18:40,481
So can you call me back?
I won 't make you talk to me.

233
00:18:40,652 --> 00:18:44,383
Just please call
so that I know you're okay.

234
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:31,201
-Holly?. Jon.
-Oh, my savior. How 's it going?

235
00:19:31,370 --> 00:19:35,067
-Not good. It' s not working.
-What? Now, I thought you were sure-fire--

236
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:36,730
-Well, because--
-Why, Jon?

237
00:19:37,009 --> 00:19:39,443
Because he's the dog from hell,
that's why.

238
00:19:39,611 --> 00:19:41,943
-But, Jon, I-- Jon?
-Yeah, I'm sending him back.

239
00:19:42,114 --> 00:19:44,947
I paid to send him to you.
I told you it'd take time.

240
00:19:45,117 --> 00:19:47,881
-It's not. You were wrong.
-Do you know how much it cost?

241
00:19:48,053 --> 00:19:52,422
Holly, I want you to call the airlines,
make a reservation and call my machine.

242
00:19:52,591 --> 00:19:55,253
Leave word what flight
you want me to put him on.

243
00:20:06,605 --> 00:20:08,095
Devon.

244
00:20:09,942 --> 00:20:11,876
What?.

245
00:20:22,321 --> 00:20:24,414
Shit.

246
00:20:27,626 --> 00:20:29,457
Devon?.

247
00:20:52,317 --> 00:20:54,148
-Yes?.
-Oh, God, Jon.

248
00:20:54,319 --> 00:20:56,810
Finally. Where the hell are you?
We had a date.

249
00:20:56,989 --> 00:20:59,890
I'm sitting here and
women are hitting on me, Jon.

250
00:21:00,058 --> 00:21:02,788
-Come on. Get your ass over here.
-Richard, hey, I ' m sorry.

251
00:21:02,961 --> 00:21:04,451
I couldn ' t make it.

252
00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:06,461
What are you talking about?
We gotta--

253
00:21:06,632 --> 00:21:09,795
-Jon, we gotta talk about the book.
-I know. Listen....

254
00:21:09,968 --> 00:21:12,061
Come on. Hurry up.
Get over here. You know--

255
00:21:12,237 --> 00:21:15,400
I can ' t help it. You know,
I wanna write something...

256
00:21:15,574 --> 00:21:18,134
-...as much as you want me to...
-Jon, come on.

257
00:21:18,310 --> 00:21:20,039
-...but l-- I can't--
-Don 't do this.

258
00:21:20,212 --> 00:21:21,611
I'm gonna just have to...

259
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:25,307
-...find something different.
-You're in violation of your contract, Jon.

260
00:21:25,484 --> 00:21:28,453
Or, you know, I'm gonna shoot myself.

261
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:30,713
Don 't say that, Jon.

262
00:21:30,889 --> 00:21:33,619
Are you taking your meds?
Are you keeping up?

263
00:21:33,792 --> 00:21:35,521
We all take them.

264
00:21:35,694 --> 00:21:37,321
You know, hey, I-- I'm your agent.

265
00:21:37,496 --> 00:21:40,659
I just want--
I want what's best for you...

266
00:21:40,832 --> 00:21:42,265
... you know, Jon?

267
00:21:42,434 --> 00:21:45,597
I have no idea what I want to write.

268
00:21:45,771 --> 00:21:48,467
Jon. Jon--

269
00:22:03,155 --> 00:22:04,986
Devon?.

270
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:45,127
Jon, you okay?.

271
00:23:12,524 --> 00:23:14,617
I am gonna kill you...

272
00:23:14,793 --> 00:23:18,058
...you jerk. You jerk.

273
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:21,028
Okay. Okay.

274
00:23:21,199 --> 00:23:22,826
-Holly?. Holly?.
-How's it going?

275
00:23:23,001 --> 00:23:24,866
-I'm not sending him back.
-Really?

276
00:23:25,036 --> 00:23:27,231
-But I paid for the return ticket.
-No.

277
00:23:27,406 --> 00:23:29,840
I'm not sending him back.

278
00:23:58,837 --> 00:24:00,702
Are you ready?.

279
00:24:10,348 --> 00:24:11,940
How do you like that?.

280
00:24:21,893 --> 00:24:25,192
How'd you get to be
such a train wreck?.

281
00:24:31,102 --> 00:24:33,195
Good boy.

282
00:24:37,142 --> 00:24:40,202
You want some air?. There you go.

283
00:24:42,013 --> 00:24:45,676
No. Devon. Devon, Devon.
What are you doing?. What are you doing?.

284
00:24:45,851 --> 00:24:48,217
No, no, no, no. Devon.

285
00:25:10,308 --> 00:25:12,606
You like that, huh?.

286
00:25:14,579 --> 00:25:17,070
You kind of like it, don't you?.

287
00:25:17,249 --> 00:25:19,581
Come on! Julius!

288
00:25:21,553 --> 00:25:24,784
Look at you, what an oil painting.

289
00:25:25,991 --> 00:25:29,188
Okay, you guys just stay there then.

290
00:25:36,701 --> 00:25:38,999
It's chow time now.

291
00:25:39,437 --> 00:25:41,405
Okay.

292
00:25:41,573 --> 00:25:43,097
Come here, come here. Hey, hey.

293
00:25:43,275 --> 00:25:45,641
Get away from there. Come here.
Come here. Devon.

294
00:25:45,810 --> 00:25:47,778
Sit. Devon. Devon, get down off there.

295
00:25:47,946 --> 00:25:51,677
Come here. Look. Sit. Devon.

296
00:25:51,850 --> 00:25:54,114
Devon, sit.

297
00:25:54,286 --> 00:25:56,846
Devon?. Come here.

298
00:25:57,022 --> 00:26:00,219
All right. We're gonna
have to work on that.

299
00:26:02,227 --> 00:26:04,787
You know, people...

300
00:26:05,330 --> 00:26:09,027
...used to come to me
for advice on dogs.

301
00:26:10,869 --> 00:26:14,396
I got Julius first from a breeder.

302
00:26:14,906 --> 00:26:17,374
And I got Stanley
from the same breeder.

303
00:26:17,542 --> 00:26:18,907
I got the dogs for Emma...

304
00:26:19,077 --> 00:26:22,569
...but, naturally...

305
00:26:23,248 --> 00:26:26,149
...they became my dogs.

306
00:26:28,219 --> 00:26:30,050
And my best friends.

307
00:26:31,756 --> 00:26:35,214
And my only friends.
All right, you stay there now.

308
00:26:35,694 --> 00:26:38,720
Go on, no, no, no. Come on.

309
00:26:55,547 --> 00:26:57,276
Get out of there! Hey, hey!

310
00:26:59,918 --> 00:27:03,012
Hey. Hey.

311
00:27:03,622 --> 00:27:05,021
Are you happy now?.

312
00:27:16,768 --> 00:27:18,565
Dad?.

313
00:27:24,643 --> 00:27:25,871
Dad?.

314
00:27:26,044 --> 00:27:27,944
Emma?.

315
00:27:29,447 --> 00:27:30,675
Hey, what's going on?.

316
00:27:30,849 --> 00:27:34,785
Oh, I'm just getting out of
the shower. I'll be right down.

317
00:27:54,305 --> 00:27:57,468
Hey. What are you doing home?.

318
00:27:57,642 --> 00:27:59,371
-Told you I was coming home.
-You did?.

319
00:27:59,544 --> 00:28:02,570
So I could pick up some of my stuff.

320
00:28:06,418 --> 00:28:10,855
-I like what you've done with the place.
-Hey, you wanna see my new dog?.

321
00:28:11,389 --> 00:28:15,257
Go outside. Get Stanley and Julius.
I'll meet you out there.

322
00:28:16,227 --> 00:28:19,094
Hi. Hi.

323
00:28:19,264 --> 00:28:21,596
I missed you.

324
00:28:21,766 --> 00:28:23,256
-Hello.
-Emma?.

325
00:28:23,435 --> 00:28:24,527
-Yeah?.
-Are they in?.

326
00:28:24,703 --> 00:28:26,500
Yeah, yeah. Come on, guys, go in.

327
00:28:26,671 --> 00:28:29,435
Inside. Come on.

328
00:28:29,607 --> 00:28:32,201
Get inside. Good boy.

329
00:28:39,651 --> 00:28:41,778
Stand back. You ready?.

330
00:28:42,721 --> 00:28:44,382
Yeah.

331
00:28:44,689 --> 00:28:45,986
Devon, look who's--

332
00:28:46,157 --> 00:28:48,785
Look who's here to see you.
It's Emma.

333
00:28:50,995 --> 00:28:54,658
Stand still now.
He-- He's afraid of people.

334
00:28:54,866 --> 00:28:56,265
He's weird.

335
00:28:56,701 --> 00:28:58,430
Devon.

336
00:29:01,106 --> 00:29:02,232
What's he doing?.

337
00:29:02,941 --> 00:29:04,909
He's herding you.

338
00:29:05,410 --> 00:29:07,378
-Why would he wanna hurt me?.
-No, no.

339
00:29:07,545 --> 00:29:11,413
Herding you. He thinks almost anything
that moves is a sheep. That's his instinct.

340
00:29:14,486 --> 00:29:17,250
That's very interesting, Dad.

341
00:29:17,789 --> 00:29:21,885
Look at him. He's so good, huh?.

342
00:29:23,361 --> 00:29:25,659
What do you think?.

343
00:29:27,098 --> 00:29:29,896
I have no idea what to think.

344
00:29:32,771 --> 00:29:34,932
Jules?.

345
00:29:35,106 --> 00:29:36,130
Stanley?.

346
00:29:37,609 --> 00:29:39,440
Hey.

347
00:29:39,811 --> 00:29:43,269
Hey, Jules. Hey.

348
00:29:43,448 --> 00:29:45,075
Stanley?.

349
00:29:45,250 --> 00:29:47,946
Hey, buddy. What's the matter?.

350
00:29:51,856 --> 00:29:53,084
Dad?.

351
00:29:53,258 --> 00:29:55,954
Something's wrong with Stanley.

352
00:29:57,929 --> 00:30:01,524
Stanley is lagging, it turns out,
because his heart rate is way down.

353
00:30:02,066 --> 00:30:04,626
It's far below what it should be.

354
00:30:04,803 --> 00:30:07,966
In fact, he may have already
had a small stroke.

355
00:30:08,807 --> 00:30:12,971
And the x-rays confirm severe hip dysplasia.
That's common in Labs.

356
00:30:13,144 --> 00:30:15,442
It's become painful for Stanley
to run or walk.

357
00:30:15,613 --> 00:30:18,605
I'm surprised he can
chase that blue ball.

358
00:30:20,151 --> 00:30:23,882
But it's the decline in heart rate
that's the most alarming.

359
00:30:24,522 --> 00:30:27,116
It's probable his heart will give out soon.

360
00:30:27,292 --> 00:30:29,157
Does Devon have
anything to do with this?.

361
00:30:29,327 --> 00:30:32,524
Oh, God, no. No.
This would've happened anyway.

362
00:30:33,164 --> 00:30:36,622
You're gonna have to decide
what you're willing to put Stanley through.

363
00:31:14,339 --> 00:31:16,034
Stan?.

364
00:31:17,041 --> 00:31:19,805
Stan, it's your blue ball.

365
00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:23,874
It's your favorite.

366
00:31:35,326 --> 00:31:37,954
Oh, Stan.

367
00:31:40,598 --> 00:31:42,566
I love you.

368
00:31:45,670 --> 00:31:47,831
My sweet guy.

369
00:32:08,493 --> 00:32:11,394
-Dad. Please don't sing that song.
-What?.

370
00:32:11,562 --> 00:32:14,087
That's their favorite song.

371
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:39,412
Dad, it's so corny.

372
00:33:11,756 --> 00:33:14,384
Everywhere but on the paper, huh?.

373
00:33:14,559 --> 00:33:16,584
Oh, God.

374
00:33:23,501 --> 00:33:25,833
See you tomorrow now.

375
00:33:26,270 --> 00:33:28,170
Okay.

376
00:33:32,410 --> 00:33:34,002
Hey, Dad.

377
00:33:34,178 --> 00:33:36,271
Oh, you're still up.

378
00:33:43,921 --> 00:33:45,752
What?.

379
00:33:47,091 --> 00:33:48,718
What?.

380
00:33:49,627 --> 00:33:51,959
What's going on, Dad?.

381
00:34:00,872 --> 00:34:03,204
Are you doing any writing?.

382
00:34:03,374 --> 00:34:07,208
I've been, you know, journaling.

383
00:34:07,378 --> 00:34:10,506
You're paying more attention
to the dog than to your work.

384
00:34:10,681 --> 00:34:12,876
I'm not getting rid of him.

385
00:34:14,252 --> 00:34:15,879
I'm gonna check on the dog.

386
00:34:16,054 --> 00:34:17,783
Mom asked me to come here...

387
00:34:17,955 --> 00:34:21,254
...because we are worried about you.

388
00:34:24,095 --> 00:34:26,563
Emmy. Emmy, Emmy, Emmy.

389
00:34:29,367 --> 00:34:31,665
I miss you, Em.

390
00:34:35,173 --> 00:34:37,141
I know that.

391
00:34:39,277 --> 00:34:41,108
I miss you...

392
00:34:43,381 --> 00:34:45,246
...both.

393
00:35:22,053 --> 00:35:23,850
Okay?.

394
00:35:44,308 --> 00:35:46,139
He's gone.

395
00:36:03,394 --> 00:36:05,624
Okay.

396
00:36:13,871 --> 00:36:15,600
Are you ready?.

397
00:36:15,773 --> 00:36:18,367
Are you sure about this?.

398
00:36:19,110 --> 00:36:21,237
Maybe I should stay.

399
00:36:21,412 --> 00:36:24,711
I'm okay. Are you okay?.

400
00:36:26,350 --> 00:36:28,284
Yeah?.

401
00:36:29,353 --> 00:36:32,584
All right. Don't miss your classes now.

402
00:36:32,757 --> 00:36:35,590
Don't worry about me.

403
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:37,728
-Are you sure?.
-I'm good, I'm good.

404
00:36:37,895 --> 00:36:40,363
Go, go. Come on.

405
00:36:49,774 --> 00:36:51,435
Bye.

406
00:37:30,114 --> 00:37:32,639
Let's go for a walk, Devon.

407
00:37:56,741 --> 00:37:58,333
Oh, my God.

408
00:37:59,977 --> 00:38:01,774
Devon!

409
00:38:02,079 --> 00:38:03,103
Devon!

410
00:38:11,322 --> 00:38:12,516
Devon!

411
00:38:15,626 --> 00:38:17,059
Devon!

412
00:38:18,529 --> 00:38:20,360
No! Devon!

413
00:38:22,633 --> 00:38:23,827
No! No!

414
00:38:35,479 --> 00:38:38,004
Come here. Come here, come here.

415
00:38:39,583 --> 00:38:42,051
Go, go, go!

416
00:38:42,219 --> 00:38:44,312
Go, go!

417
00:38:47,058 --> 00:38:49,253
Goddamn you!

418
00:38:50,861 --> 00:38:52,624
My God, I hate you, you bastard!

419
00:38:52,797 --> 00:38:54,424
We're finished!

420
00:38:57,335 --> 00:38:58,825
Don't you understand?.

421
00:38:59,003 --> 00:39:01,563
If you don't change, you can't live here.

422
00:39:53,891 --> 00:39:56,359
So you don't think your roommates
are gonna mind?.

423
00:39:56,527 --> 00:39:58,495
Julius is a great dog, you know that.

424
00:39:58,662 --> 00:40:01,426
Dad, tell me what's going on.
Why do I have to take Julius?

425
00:40:01,599 --> 00:40:03,624
Look, Devon, he's down in the basement.

426
00:40:03,801 --> 00:40:05,826
He can't come upstairs.
I gotta lock him in.

427
00:40:06,003 --> 00:40:07,027
-He hates that.
-Dad?

428
00:40:07,204 --> 00:40:11,106
Em, everything's gonna be fine. I just
don't want anything else bad to happen.

429
00:40:11,275 --> 00:40:12,708
What does that mean?

430
00:40:12,877 --> 00:40:15,846
Em, the other line's ringing.
I gotta take this. Hold on now.

431
00:40:16,013 --> 00:40:17,037
Dad--

432
00:40:17,214 --> 00:40:18,613
-Yeah?.
-Good news, Jon.

433
00:40:18,783 --> 00:40:22,275
It turns out the house is available.
It's a perfect place to write.

434
00:40:22,453 --> 00:40:24,284
Great. Wonderful. Yeah.

435
00:40:24,455 --> 00:40:26,286
-Yeah, I wanna see it right away.
-Now?

436
00:40:26,457 --> 00:40:29,483
Yeah, I'm on my way up.
I'm getting in the car right now.

437
00:40:29,660 --> 00:40:32,891
-Do you want me to find you a hotel?
-No, I'm gonna sleep in the car.

438
00:41:04,495 --> 00:41:07,123
This is the place you want.

439
00:41:07,731 --> 00:41:09,198
It's 42 acres.

440
00:41:09,867 --> 00:41:12,734
Been on the market for three years.

441
00:41:12,970 --> 00:41:14,961
The owners are definitely
willing to rent...

442
00:41:15,139 --> 00:41:18,108
...if you understand that
it's an as-is situation.

443
00:41:19,677 --> 00:41:22,111
Now, the rent is low
and the owners are elderly...

444
00:41:22,279 --> 00:41:25,612
...and live in Florida. So they're not
gonna be able to come up here...

445
00:41:25,783 --> 00:41:27,774
-...and do any small repairs.
-That's okay.

446
00:41:27,952 --> 00:41:31,251
This isn't gonna be permanent.
Will they rent month-to-month?.

447
00:41:31,422 --> 00:41:35,381
I think they'd be happy to see
any money come from this place.

448
00:41:36,260 --> 00:41:39,787
Oh, down there is Bedlam Corners.

449
00:41:39,964 --> 00:41:43,456
We can drive down there. I can
introduce you to a few people, if you like.

450
00:41:43,634 --> 00:41:47,161
Oh, no. I don't wanna meet anyone.

451
00:41:47,338 --> 00:41:50,205
You can't get a cell-phone signal
on the mountain.

452
00:41:50,374 --> 00:41:52,365
Oh, thank God.

453
00:41:52,543 --> 00:41:54,568
And there's no phone service
to the house...

454
00:41:54,745 --> 00:41:57,111
...but I can call the phone company
for you.

455
00:41:57,281 --> 00:42:01,012
No, not necessary.
I don't want a phone in the house.

456
00:46:06,263 --> 00:46:09,096
Hey, stay in here now.

457
00:46:26,183 --> 00:46:29,482
Sure is good to see someone
in the Matthews' farm again.

458
00:46:33,824 --> 00:46:35,416
Coffee?.

459
00:46:36,360 --> 00:46:39,158
-Okay. Thank you.
-Help yourself.

460
00:46:45,636 --> 00:46:47,968
You can see my farm
from your window.

461
00:46:48,138 --> 00:46:51,801
Oh, yeah. The whole town
can see your farm up on that hill.

462
00:46:56,346 --> 00:46:59,008
You can see everything?.

463
00:46:59,183 --> 00:47:01,845
Yeah, we don't miss anything
around here.

464
00:47:02,820 --> 00:47:04,879
What kind of work do you do?.

465
00:47:10,327 --> 00:47:12,386
I don't know what I do.

466
00:47:12,729 --> 00:47:15,254
Aren't you the man with that dog?.

467
00:47:18,569 --> 00:47:22,699
Yes, I'm the dog man. Thank you.

468
00:47:24,074 --> 00:47:25,939
Oh, that'll be a dollar.

469
00:47:26,109 --> 00:47:28,475
I'm sorry. Yeah.

470
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:45,861
I never met a writer before.

471
00:47:47,297 --> 00:47:50,425
-What was the last thing you wrote?.
-Who told you I was a writer?.

472
00:47:50,601 --> 00:47:54,765
You put anyone's name in a computer,
you can find out what they do.

473
00:47:55,539 --> 00:47:57,803
Come here, come here, come here.

474
00:47:59,710 --> 00:48:02,008
You need any work done
on the house?.

475
00:48:02,179 --> 00:48:03,874
No.

476
00:48:04,314 --> 00:48:06,339
I can fix anything.

477
00:48:06,516 --> 00:48:08,950
I don't need anything fixed.

478
00:48:11,955 --> 00:48:13,547
-What's this?.
-I found a woman...

479
00:48:13,724 --> 00:48:15,351
...who can help you with your dog.

480
00:48:15,525 --> 00:48:17,686
Hey, I don't need any help
with the dog.

481
00:48:17,861 --> 00:48:19,886
Oh, yes, you do.

482
00:49:04,641 --> 00:49:05,699
What?.

483
00:49:07,644 --> 00:49:11,512
-You got a phone call at the store.
-All right.

484
00:49:35,605 --> 00:49:38,199
-Hello.
-Jon, is that you?

485
00:49:38,375 --> 00:49:41,970
-Paula.
-What the hell is going on?

486
00:49:42,145 --> 00:49:44,136
Emma gave me a number
for a payphone...

487
00:49:44,314 --> 00:49:46,282
...in the middle of nowhere.

488
00:49:46,450 --> 00:49:48,418
Where are you?

489
00:49:51,054 --> 00:49:54,114
I rented this place in the country.

490
00:49:54,291 --> 00:49:55,485
Why, Jon?

491
00:49:57,060 --> 00:49:58,789
Even for you, this is crazy.

492
00:49:58,962 --> 00:50:04,491
Look, I'll come home.
Let's figure this out. Meet me.

493
00:50:05,969 --> 00:50:07,402
Jon?

494
00:50:09,072 --> 00:50:10,733
Jon?

495
00:50:12,142 --> 00:50:15,942
Jon, I think I'm losing the connection.
Jon, can you hear me?

496
00:50:17,147 --> 00:50:19,172
Hello?

497
00:50:20,283 --> 00:50:22,717
Hello? Now--

498
00:51:51,108 --> 00:51:53,303
You're not barking.

499
00:51:58,548 --> 00:51:59,572
Who are you?.

500
00:52:00,917 --> 00:52:03,784
-Jon Katz.
-Right.

501
00:52:04,688 --> 00:52:08,021
You ' re the man with the abused dog.

502
00:52:13,396 --> 00:52:14,488
This is Joe.

503
00:52:16,833 --> 00:52:18,460
I'm gonna give your dog a test.

504
00:52:18,635 --> 00:52:20,330
-My dog doesn't like tests.
-Too bad.

505
00:52:20,504 --> 00:52:23,029
-I don't like tests.
-lf you're gonna be my student...

506
00:52:23,206 --> 00:52:26,573
...you're gonna take my test.
Come on, Joe.

507
00:52:27,144 --> 00:52:29,840
I take my payment for
the first session up-front.

508
00:52:30,013 --> 00:52:31,844
It's $200.

509
00:52:32,883 --> 00:52:35,283
I only take cash.

510
00:52:41,158 --> 00:52:42,819
Get your dog.

511
00:53:01,545 --> 00:53:03,536
Border collies are working dogs.

512
00:53:03,713 --> 00:53:06,614
They've been herding sheep
for centuries in lreland...

513
00:53:06,783 --> 00:53:08,978
...and Scotland, all over the world.

514
00:53:09,152 --> 00:53:12,349
Pay close attention because you're next.

515
00:53:14,858 --> 00:53:16,883
Get back, Joe.

516
00:53:21,198 --> 00:53:23,598
Step back with your dog.

517
00:53:25,035 --> 00:53:26,866
Out, sheep.

518
00:53:33,810 --> 00:53:35,903
Away to me, Joe.

519
00:53:52,229 --> 00:53:53,821
Lie down.

520
00:53:54,998 --> 00:53:56,556
Walk up, Joe.

521
00:54:01,705 --> 00:54:03,605
Away to me.

522
00:54:29,899 --> 00:54:31,992
Attaboy, Joe.

523
00:54:34,371 --> 00:54:35,770
It's your turn.

524
00:54:35,939 --> 00:54:39,602
I need to see how your dog
responds to the sheep.

525
00:54:39,776 --> 00:54:43,735
It's what I call the instinct test.
Are you ready?.

526
00:54:43,913 --> 00:54:46,040
Come here, come here, come here.
Hey, hey, hey.

527
00:54:46,216 --> 00:54:49,777
Devon, Devon. Devon, now,
I want you to do good, okay?.

528
00:54:49,953 --> 00:54:53,047
Okay?. Okay. All right.

529
00:54:53,223 --> 00:54:54,781
-Are you ready?.
-Yeah.

530
00:54:56,459 --> 00:54:58,552
Out, sheep. Out, sheep.

531
00:54:59,262 --> 00:55:00,729
Unleash Devon.

532
00:55:02,399 --> 00:55:03,593
Go!

533
00:55:10,640 --> 00:55:13,040
Now he should begin
to circle around the flock.

534
00:55:15,812 --> 00:55:17,712
Why is he going that way?.

535
00:55:21,918 --> 00:55:23,977
Oh, he's circling them.

536
00:55:29,092 --> 00:55:32,027
Do you see the difference
between the two dogs?.

537
00:55:32,195 --> 00:55:34,095
Where Joe is calm...

538
00:55:34,264 --> 00:55:37,165
...and can move the sheep
by eyeing them...

539
00:55:38,735 --> 00:55:42,466
...your dog is struggling.
He's lunging.

540
00:55:58,054 --> 00:56:00,249
All right, that's it. Call him in.

541
00:56:03,760 --> 00:56:05,887
Devon?. Devon.

542
00:56:07,464 --> 00:56:10,194
Devon. Devon!

543
00:56:11,067 --> 00:56:13,661
Come here. Devon!

544
00:56:16,206 --> 00:56:17,230
Devon!

545
00:56:19,275 --> 00:56:21,505
Oh, you little shit!

546
00:56:21,778 --> 00:56:23,712
Come here!

547
00:56:24,114 --> 00:56:26,582
Why are you such a mess?.

548
00:56:27,851 --> 00:56:29,375
Away to me, Joe.

549
00:56:31,654 --> 00:56:35,021
Come here, come here, come here.
Devon. Devon, Devon.

550
00:56:35,558 --> 00:56:37,253
Come here!

551
00:56:37,427 --> 00:56:39,657
Away to me, Devon. Come on...

552
00:56:39,829 --> 00:56:42,161
...work with me, Devon.

553
00:56:43,867 --> 00:56:47,064
Come on, come on, come on.
Come here.

554
00:56:50,006 --> 00:56:51,735
Away to me, Joe.

555
00:56:52,675 --> 00:56:54,540
Away to me, Joe.

556
00:56:55,044 --> 00:56:56,875
Hold still.

557
00:57:01,718 --> 00:57:03,413
Attaboy, Joe.

558
00:57:05,622 --> 00:57:08,284
Just circle the sheep,
that's all you were asked to do.

559
00:57:12,762 --> 00:57:15,424
He failed the test, didn't he?.

560
00:57:17,300 --> 00:57:18,631
Yes.

561
00:57:20,603 --> 00:57:23,595
You've gotta see this dog
for who he is.

562
00:57:23,773 --> 00:57:27,231
He's lost his connection to the world.
He's lost his connection to himself.

563
00:57:27,410 --> 00:57:31,744
He's lost his instinct
and you're not helping him find it.

564
00:57:34,751 --> 00:57:36,810
I don't understand
what you're talking about.

565
00:57:36,986 --> 00:57:40,183
It's not the dog that's messed up,
you're messed up.

566
00:57:40,356 --> 00:57:43,587
This dog is the least of your problems.

567
00:57:45,862 --> 00:57:47,659
Come on, come on.

568
00:57:48,097 --> 00:57:50,224
You paid $200.

569
00:57:50,400 --> 00:57:52,391
I'm gonna give you $200 worth.

570
00:57:52,569 --> 00:57:55,197
I didn't pay $200 for your psychobabble.

571
00:57:55,371 --> 00:57:56,838
-Get back here.
-It's my problem?.

572
00:57:57,006 --> 00:57:58,234
-Yes.
-My problem?.

573
00:57:58,408 --> 00:58:00,273
-Yes!
-It's me?.

574
00:58:00,443 --> 00:58:03,879
Yes. You are one angry
son of a bitch.

575
00:58:05,982 --> 00:58:07,745
Come on. Come on!

576
00:58:07,917 --> 00:58:09,646
Come on!

577
00:58:52,128 --> 00:58:54,528
Son of a bitch.

578
00:58:59,536 --> 00:59:03,905
Hello, hi. Don't need any help.

579
00:59:09,012 --> 00:59:11,572
-I don't need any help.
-Name's Anthony.

580
00:59:11,748 --> 00:59:14,342
Wonderful, you have a name.
What don't you understand...

581
00:59:14,517 --> 00:59:17,384
...about ""l don't need help,""
Anthony?.

582
00:59:17,554 --> 00:59:19,715
What's this?. Oh, no.

583
00:59:36,472 --> 00:59:39,305
It works better if it's on.

584
00:59:39,475 --> 00:59:41,636
All right, all right, all right.

585
00:59:41,811 --> 00:59:43,540
Yeah.

586
00:59:48,151 --> 00:59:50,517
First-time operator.

587
00:59:51,921 --> 00:59:54,788
-You gotta keep it square.
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.

588
00:59:54,958 --> 00:59:56,550
Yeah.

589
01:00:04,467 --> 01:00:06,230
Okay.

590
01:00:06,836 --> 01:00:08,235
All right, all right.

591
01:00:08,638 --> 01:00:10,435
Come here, come here.

592
01:00:11,608 --> 01:00:15,044
I got a shepherd-husky mix.

593
01:00:16,446 --> 01:00:18,641
He doesn't have half the power
of this dog.

594
01:00:28,157 --> 01:00:29,954
You married?.

595
01:00:31,427 --> 01:00:32,985
Yeah.

596
01:00:33,663 --> 01:00:37,099
-She's not here.
-No, she's not.

597
01:00:37,266 --> 01:00:39,063
Separated?.

598
01:00:40,136 --> 01:00:41,694
No.

599
01:00:42,438 --> 01:00:45,965
No, we have a great marriage.
We're independent, you know?.

600
01:00:47,076 --> 01:00:50,045
We accept short absences
from each other.

601
01:00:51,881 --> 01:00:53,746
Sometimes...

602
01:00:53,916 --> 01:00:57,545
...she accepts them
with disturbing enthusiasm.

603
01:01:07,530 --> 01:01:11,022
-So let me know how much I owe you.
-Yeah.

604
01:01:12,135 --> 01:01:14,535
I'll send you a bill.

605
01:01:17,607 --> 01:01:20,633
Hey, take it easy there, old guy.

606
01:01:20,810 --> 01:01:22,402
All right, Anthony.

607
01:01:31,087 --> 01:01:33,419
That dog's got a lot of energy.

608
01:01:33,589 --> 01:01:36,285
Who is the owner of this crazy dog?.

609
01:01:36,459 --> 01:01:40,088
-Be nice.
-Here he comes.

610
01:01:48,404 --> 01:01:49,894
Hey.

611
01:01:51,741 --> 01:01:53,766
-This is my daughter, lda.
-Hi, lda.

612
01:01:53,943 --> 01:01:56,571
I've been telling her about your dog.

613
01:01:57,080 --> 01:01:59,105
Who are these guys?.

614
01:01:59,682 --> 01:02:02,082
They wanted to see him too.

615
01:02:04,754 --> 01:02:06,654
He's running.

616
01:02:08,891 --> 01:02:10,381
What do you feed this dog?.

617
01:02:10,560 --> 01:02:12,084
Special dog food.

618
01:02:12,261 --> 01:02:14,593
High in protein, high in fat.

619
01:02:15,465 --> 01:02:18,696
Anthony says you
brush this dog's teeth.

620
01:02:20,002 --> 01:02:22,334
His teeth were rotten when I got him.

621
01:02:22,505 --> 01:02:25,099
Hey, how much you spend
on feeding this dog?.

622
01:02:25,274 --> 01:02:27,037
Forty dollars a week.

623
01:02:27,643 --> 01:02:30,476
I can't spend that much on a cow.

624
01:02:30,646 --> 01:02:33,274
Well, my dog's smarter
than your cow.

625
01:02:33,750 --> 01:02:36,480
I'd like to be this guy's dog.

626
01:02:38,688 --> 01:02:40,417
If he's so much trouble...

627
01:02:41,124 --> 01:02:43,820
...maybe you should just get rid of him.

628
01:02:46,529 --> 01:02:48,690
I'm not getting rid of this dog.

629
01:02:48,865 --> 01:02:51,197
I'm not giving up on him.

630
01:04:47,216 --> 01:04:49,650
Leave your dog in the car.

631
01:04:50,519 --> 01:04:53,955
Go take your anger out
on that hay.

632
01:04:54,423 --> 01:04:58,052
And when you're finished,
come and see me.

633
01:06:16,405 --> 01:06:18,032
The first thing you do...

634
01:06:18,207 --> 01:06:20,402
...is stay calm.

635
01:06:21,277 --> 01:06:24,007
Make eye contact...

636
01:06:24,647 --> 01:06:27,047
...say his name...

637
01:06:28,417 --> 01:06:30,681
...and give him a treat.

638
01:06:34,690 --> 01:06:37,250
-Devon, look here.
-No.

639
01:06:38,194 --> 01:06:39,855
Only say his name.

640
01:06:42,732 --> 01:06:44,427
Devon.

641
01:06:47,737 --> 01:06:49,500
Again.

642
01:06:52,808 --> 01:06:54,571
Devon.

643
01:06:56,612 --> 01:06:58,409
Do it again.

644
01:07:02,184 --> 01:07:03,981
Devon.

645
01:07:09,658 --> 01:07:11,489
Devon.

646
01:07:20,803 --> 01:07:22,430
Devon.

647
01:07:22,605 --> 01:07:24,573
Do it again.

648
01:07:28,711 --> 01:07:30,338
Devon.

649
01:07:31,247 --> 01:07:32,612
Do it again.

650
01:07:34,617 --> 01:07:36,380
Devon.

651
01:07:45,461 --> 01:07:47,156
Devon.

652
01:07:49,765 --> 01:07:52,529
-Again.
-Devon.

653
01:07:55,137 --> 01:07:57,037
And again.

654
01:07:59,208 --> 01:08:00,971
Devon.

655
01:08:06,148 --> 01:08:08,378
Let's try one more thing today.

656
01:08:09,185 --> 01:08:11,847
Look him in the eye, say his name...

657
01:08:12,021 --> 01:08:14,285
...and then ask him to sit.

658
01:08:20,529 --> 01:08:22,520
Devon...

659
01:08:22,865 --> 01:08:24,765
...sit.

660
01:08:28,337 --> 01:08:29,429
Sit.

661
01:08:40,216 --> 01:08:41,615
Good boy.

662
01:08:41,784 --> 01:08:45,151
Good boy. That's my boy.

663
01:08:45,321 --> 01:08:48,757
-Good boy.
-Well, that's about it for today.

664
01:08:49,525 --> 01:08:51,288
That's it?.

665
01:08:51,861 --> 01:08:55,456
One small step at a time.

666
01:08:57,066 --> 01:08:59,091
You're welcome to...

667
01:08:59,268 --> 01:09:02,795
...come back and continue
whenever you can.

668
01:09:04,240 --> 01:09:05,673
Beginnings are hard.

669
01:09:10,646 --> 01:09:12,273
Come on.

670
01:09:41,410 --> 01:09:43,310
I should've been there
when you got there.

671
01:09:43,479 --> 01:09:45,447
I'm sorry.

672
01:09:46,248 --> 01:09:48,614
When are you coming home?

673
01:09:51,086 --> 01:09:53,145
Soon.

674
01:09:53,522 --> 01:09:56,719
-When?
-Paula, l--

675
01:09:56,892 --> 01:09:59,588
You know, soon.

676
01:09:59,762 --> 01:10:02,390
Yeah, I'll-- I'll--

677
01:10:02,565 --> 01:10:04,931
I'll be home soon.

678
01:11:20,075 --> 01:11:21,804
Devon?.

679
01:11:25,881 --> 01:11:27,849
Devon?.

680
01:11:29,018 --> 01:11:30,952
Devon!

681
01:11:33,489 --> 01:11:35,548
Devon?.

682
01:11:35,724 --> 01:11:38,056
Oh, shit!

683
01:11:41,130 --> 01:11:43,189
Devon!

684
01:11:46,035 --> 01:11:47,468
Devon!

685
01:11:53,275 --> 01:11:55,300
Devon!

686
01:12:05,120 --> 01:12:07,054
Come here.

687
01:12:52,067 --> 01:12:54,331
-Hey.
-Hey.

688
01:12:55,237 --> 01:12:56,966
-What's up?.
-Hey.

689
01:12:57,139 --> 01:12:59,471
Those are the keys to the farmhouse.

690
01:13:00,709 --> 01:13:02,836
I'm going home.

691
01:13:03,011 --> 01:13:04,444
Good.

692
01:13:04,613 --> 01:13:06,877
I'll be back.

693
01:13:07,049 --> 01:13:09,449
-You're coming back?.
-Oh, yeah, I'll be back.

694
01:13:09,618 --> 01:13:13,452
Maybe I can get my wife and daughter
to come up, you know?.

695
01:13:14,523 --> 01:13:17,424
You think you'd be able to
take care of the place for a while?.

696
01:13:17,593 --> 01:13:18,821
-Yeah.
-Yeah?.

697
01:13:18,994 --> 01:13:20,894
Glad to.

698
01:13:21,330 --> 01:13:22,854
All right.

699
01:13:25,200 --> 01:13:27,828
You need me to do anything
right away?.

700
01:13:29,738 --> 01:13:33,902
That faucet in the kitchen, I could
never get that thing to stop leaking.

701
01:13:34,843 --> 01:13:36,640
-I'll take care of it.
-Okay.

702
01:13:36,812 --> 01:13:39,042
Thanks, Anthony.

703
01:13:39,381 --> 01:13:41,008
See you.

704
01:13:49,158 --> 01:13:51,092
See you, Devon.

705
01:14:39,508 --> 01:14:41,703
Good boy.

706
01:15:04,399 --> 01:15:06,299
Yeah.
