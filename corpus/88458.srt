1
00:01:07,367 --> 00:01:10,518
This is cool.

2
00:01:13,687 --> 00:01:16,804
Cut it out, butthole.

3
00:01:28,007 --> 00:01:31,522
Hey, baby.
I'm like, pretty tall.

4
00:01:32,607 --> 00:01:35,599
Cut it out, I'm trying to score!

5
00:01:45,647 --> 00:01:49,322
Look at me, you buttholes.

6
00:01:50,167 --> 00:01:55,287
- How's it going?
- No way, Beavis, I saw her first.

7
00:01:55,447 --> 00:02:00,475
- Dammit, I'm gonna kick your ass!
- I saw her first. Get out of here.

8
00:02:05,687 --> 00:02:07,882
Butt-head! Butt-head, wake up!

9
00:02:10,207 --> 00:02:16,043
- Dammit, Beavis, I was about to score!
- Yeah, but check it out. It's gone.

10
00:02:18,367 --> 00:02:21,040
- What?
- The TV.

11
00:02:23,127 --> 00:02:28,679
- Oh, yeah. Well, where is it?
- I don't know.

12
00:02:28,847 --> 00:02:34,877
I just woke up, and it was gone.
And look, the window's broken too.

13
00:02:35,047 --> 00:02:38,801
A couple hundred bucks for this baby.

14
00:02:57,887 --> 00:03:03,484
- I think I just figured something out.
- What?

15
00:03:03,647 --> 00:03:08,277
- This sucks.
- Yeah, it really sucks.

16
00:03:09,087 --> 00:03:12,841
This sucks more than anything
that has ever sucked before.

17
00:03:13,007 --> 00:03:16,795
We must find this butthole
that took our TV.

18
00:04:58,047 --> 00:05:01,084
It's not in here.

19
00:05:01,247 --> 00:05:05,638
What are we gonna do, Butt-head?
What if we never find it?

20
00:05:05,807 --> 00:05:08,480
Settle down, Beavis.

21
00:05:11,847 --> 00:05:16,238
Hey, wait a minute. I don't wanna
go to school! We gotta find our TV.

22
00:05:16,407 --> 00:05:19,843
Shut up, Beavis, I got an idea.

23
00:05:22,207 --> 00:05:26,439
Let's just wheel this thing
back to the house.

24
00:05:30,447 --> 00:05:34,042
Excuse me, boys.
What's going on here?

25
00:05:34,207 --> 00:05:39,565
- Someone stole our TV.
- Yeah, we're gonna use this one. Move.

26
00:05:39,727 --> 00:05:44,198
I'm afraid that TV belongs to the school.

27
00:05:44,367 --> 00:05:48,360
This could be a really
positive experience for you guys.

28
00:05:48,527 --> 00:05:55,444
There's an exciting world out there.
We don't need TV to entertain us.

29
00:05:55,607 --> 00:05:58,326
He said "anus".

30
00:05:58,487 --> 00:06:01,365
Entertain us. Anus. Oh, yeah.

31
00:06:01,527 --> 00:06:04,837
Have you guys heard a word I said?

32
00:06:05,007 --> 00:06:10,764
- Yeah, "anus".
- Yeah, I heard it too.

33
00:06:10,927 --> 00:06:15,762
Just take the TV back
to the AV room, right now.

34
00:06:15,927 --> 00:06:20,876
And try to be a little more open
to life experiences.

35
00:06:21,567 --> 00:06:23,523
What a dork.

36
00:06:25,887 --> 00:06:28,765
Just get it over here.

37
00:06:33,807 --> 00:06:37,197
- That was cool.
- No, it wasn't!

38
00:06:37,367 --> 00:06:39,927
Oh, yeah.

39
00:06:41,367 --> 00:06:44,916
What's going on out here? Oh, no!

40
00:06:45,087 --> 00:06:49,922
- That belongs to the school.
- It's supposed to be in the AV room.

41
00:06:50,087 --> 00:06:55,480
Get back here! Beavis and Butt-head,
you're both expelled!

42
00:07:00,807 --> 00:07:04,800
Check it out, Beavis.
I didn't know Anderson had a camper.

43
00:07:04,967 --> 00:07:08,277
Maybe it has a TV.

44
00:07:09,807 --> 00:07:13,482
Are you boys here
to look at the refrigerator?.

45
00:07:13,647 --> 00:07:18,596
- No.
- We're here to look at the TV.

46
00:07:18,767 --> 00:07:23,363
Tom didn't tell me it was broken.
Go on in.

47
00:07:26,327 --> 00:07:31,720
That should hold. The most important
thing you can have on a camper -

48
00:07:31,887 --> 00:07:36,483
- is a good butane regulator.
And this here's the best one they make.

49
00:07:36,647 --> 00:07:42,517
- I hope we can get that fridge fixed.
- We've saved for this trip forever.

50
00:07:42,687 --> 00:07:47,636
We're going come hell or high water.
What in the hell is that?

51
00:07:50,567 --> 00:07:53,957
Must be them damn buzzard hawks.

52
00:07:54,127 --> 00:07:56,436
Gotta get me something to drink.

53
00:08:04,327 --> 00:08:08,400
- This crap is warm!
- You butthole, you broke it!

54
00:08:08,567 --> 00:08:10,922
I know. Dammit!

55
00:08:12,927 --> 00:08:17,443
- What the hell's going on here?
- They're here to fix the TV.

56
00:08:17,607 --> 00:08:21,885
- The TV ain't broken.
- Yeah, it is.

57
00:08:23,127 --> 00:08:27,086
You two look kind of familiar.

58
00:08:27,247 --> 00:08:32,241
Ain't you them kids that have been
whacking off in my tool shed?

59
00:08:37,847 --> 00:08:41,522
- We still don't have a TV, Butt-head.
- I know, Beavis.

60
00:08:41,687 --> 00:08:47,125
- Dammit! I can't sleep without a TV!
- Dumb-ass.

61
00:08:53,607 --> 00:08:58,886
- What's your problem, Beavis?
- I need TV.

62
00:08:59,047 --> 00:09:03,359
I need TV now, dammit!

63
00:09:12,607 --> 00:09:15,644
- Dammit.
- No ...

64
00:09:15,807 --> 00:09:19,356
- Dammit.
- No ...

65
00:09:25,887 --> 00:09:31,644
You sure these guys can pull this off?
It's got to look like an accident.

66
00:09:40,567 --> 00:09:44,082
Beavis and Butt-head!
You little bastards!

67
00:09:44,247 --> 00:09:50,322
- Can we watch your TV?
- No, you're expelled. Get out of here!

68
00:09:51,967 --> 00:09:56,518
I need a TV now.
We're missing everything.

69
00:09:58,287 --> 00:10:03,361
Hold on a minute. That must be them.
I'll call you back. Come in!

70
00:10:05,047 --> 00:10:07,277
TV, yeah!

71
00:10:07,447 --> 00:10:12,157
- You're late.
- Really?. Did we miss "Baywatch"?

72
00:10:17,487 --> 00:10:21,765
Earl said you guys were young,
but Jeez ...

73
00:10:21,927 --> 00:10:26,000
As long as you can get the job done.
What are your names?

74
00:10:26,167 --> 00:10:31,036
- Butt-head.
- I'm Beavis.

75
00:10:31,207 --> 00:10:35,086
I don't wanna know your real names
anyway. Mine's Muddy.

76
00:10:35,247 --> 00:10:41,322
I'll get right to the point. 10 grand plus
expenses, payable after you do her.

77
00:10:41,487 --> 00:10:44,047
Do her?.

78
00:10:44,207 --> 00:10:49,964
I'm offering you $10,000 plus expenses
to do my wife. We got a deal?

79
00:10:50,127 --> 00:10:54,484
- Actually, we just wanna watch TV.
- Shut up, Beavis.

80
00:10:54,647 --> 00:10:59,562
- Yeah, we'll do your wife.
- No, I wanna watch TV.

81
00:11:00,967 --> 00:11:06,325
Dammit, Beavis, you butt-munch.
He wants us to score with his wife.

82
00:11:06,487 --> 00:11:10,605
And he's gonna pay us.
We can buy a new TV.

83
00:11:10,767 --> 00:11:13,759
Really?. Cool.

84
00:11:16,647 --> 00:11:21,323
- We'll do it, sir.
- Let's get down to business.

85
00:11:21,487 --> 00:11:26,607
Here she is, boys. Her name's Dallas.
She ain't as sweet as she looks.

86
00:11:26,767 --> 00:11:31,397
She stole everything from me. She'll
do you twice as fast as you do her.

87
00:11:33,407 --> 00:11:36,046
Cool.

88
00:11:36,207 --> 00:11:42,601
She's holed up in a room in Las Vegas.
I got you a room right next to hers.

89
00:11:42,767 --> 00:11:47,045
- I'll drive you to the airport.
- "Holed up".

90
00:11:48,727 --> 00:11:50,797
Hole ...

91
00:11:50,967 --> 00:11:55,040
- Can we watch some TV first?
- No.

92
00:11:58,487 --> 00:12:01,240
Listen, this is real important.

93
00:12:01,407 --> 00:12:04,399
My wife's got this leather satchel.

94
00:12:04,567 --> 00:12:08,276
It's a black bag about this big.
Bring it back.

95
00:12:08,447 --> 00:12:12,360
Sentimental value.
Any questions so far?.

96
00:12:12,527 --> 00:12:16,600
Does she have big hooters?

97
00:12:16,767 --> 00:12:18,837
She sure does.

98
00:12:19,007 --> 00:12:22,636
This is gonna be cool.

99
00:12:28,407 --> 00:12:32,195
You guys are funny.
Let's have a drink on it.

100
00:12:39,847 --> 00:12:42,077
Don't let me down.

101
00:12:45,167 --> 00:12:49,001
We're gonna get paid to score.

102
00:12:49,167 --> 00:12:53,365
Then we're gonna get a big-screen TV,
with two remotes.

103
00:12:53,527 --> 00:12:58,362
Beavis, this is the greatest day
of our lives.

104
00:13:04,887 --> 00:13:07,526
Here you are.

105
00:13:07,687 --> 00:13:11,839
Hey Beavis, she touched my butt.

106
00:13:13,727 --> 00:13:20,166
- Are you to heading for Las Vegas?
- Yeah, we're gonna score.

107
00:13:20,327 --> 00:13:26,163
I hope to score big there myself.
I'm mostly gonna be doing the slots.

108
00:13:26,327 --> 00:13:29,717
I'm hoping to do some sluts, too.

109
00:13:29,887 --> 00:13:35,644
- Do they have a lot of sluts in Vegas?
- You won't know where to begin.

110
00:13:35,807 --> 00:13:42,565
Butt-head, this chick is pretty cool.
She says there's lots of sluts in Vegas.

111
00:13:42,727 --> 00:13:47,642
It's so nice to meet young men
who are so well-mannered.

112
00:13:47,807 --> 00:13:53,279
I'm gonna have money, a big-screen TV,
and there's gonna be sluts everywhere.

113
00:13:53,447 --> 00:13:57,122
- It's gonna rule.
- Well, that's nice.

114
00:13:57,287 --> 00:14:00,404
... forpre-flightsafetyinstructions.

115
00:14:00,567 --> 00:14:05,402
To fasten yourseatbelt,
insert the free end into the coupling.

116
00:14:05,567 --> 00:14:08,445
"Insert" ...

117
00:14:16,167 --> 00:14:19,523
Hi, can I help you with that?

118
00:14:24,327 --> 00:14:27,876
- There you go. All set.
- I love you.

119
00:14:30,007 --> 00:14:32,760
Cut it out! I want her to do it.

120
00:14:32,927 --> 00:14:35,964
Come to Butt-head.

121
00:14:36,127 --> 00:14:40,120
Flight attendants, prepare for take-off..

122
00:14:41,767 --> 00:14:44,600
Hey, what's going on?

123
00:14:47,687 --> 00:14:53,444
- We're gonna die! We're all gonna die!
- Come to Butt-head.

124
00:15:01,127 --> 00:15:05,086
Could you, like,
do that thing with my belt again?

125
00:15:11,047 --> 00:15:14,562
- This is her.
- She looks lovely.

126
00:15:14,727 --> 00:15:21,724
I'm probably gonna make out with her
before we ... get down, you know?.

127
00:15:21,887 --> 00:15:26,722
You have to speak up, son.
I have this ringing in my ears.

128
00:15:26,887 --> 00:15:30,675
My doctor says it could be related
to my heart palpitations.

129
00:15:30,847 --> 00:15:33,805
Really?. I poop too much.

130
00:15:33,967 --> 00:15:39,121
Maybe you're lactose intolerant.

131
00:15:39,287 --> 00:15:43,803
No, I poop too much.
And then I get tired.

132
00:15:43,967 --> 00:15:47,960
Tired? I know all about tired, dear.

133
00:15:48,127 --> 00:15:52,837
I have just the thing for you.
Take a couple of these.

134
00:15:53,007 --> 00:15:57,159
- They perk me right up.
- Thanks.

135
00:16:00,447 --> 00:16:03,086
Tastes like crap.

136
00:16:03,247 --> 00:16:06,956
- What else you got?
- Go right ahead. Help yourself.

137
00:16:12,407 --> 00:16:16,605
So ... going to Las Vegas?

138
00:16:33,367 --> 00:16:40,603
Our dinner selections for tonight are
chicken piccata or seafood gumbo.

139
00:16:40,767 --> 00:16:45,887
- Does the gumbo have corn in it?
- Cornholio needs piccata for bunghole!

140
00:16:46,047 --> 00:16:51,075
- You'll have to wait your turn, sir.
- My bunghole will not wait.

141
00:16:55,287 --> 00:17:00,441
Hey, I got a beer. Want some?

142
00:17:00,607 --> 00:17:02,757
I am Cornholio!

143
00:17:10,167 --> 00:17:13,842
- Get the hell out of the cockpit!
- You said ...

144
00:17:24,527 --> 00:17:27,883
This is Las Vegas?

145
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:32,882
I thought there'd be casinos
and lights and stuff.

146
00:17:35,087 --> 00:17:40,081
- Why's that guy holding a sign?
- Maybe he's blind.

147
00:17:41,407 --> 00:17:44,399
Check this out.

148
00:17:49,207 --> 00:17:53,405
Excuse me, would you guys know
where I could find these guys?

149
00:18:03,047 --> 00:18:06,119
Someone named Boot?

150
00:18:06,287 --> 00:18:09,962
- This says "Beavis".
- And "Boot-head".

151
00:18:10,127 --> 00:18:16,646
"Butt-head". Don't you get it? These
dudes have the same names as us.

152
00:18:16,807 --> 00:18:21,835
- Really?. We should party.
- This way, sirs.

153
00:18:22,007 --> 00:18:25,124
So where are those guys?

154
00:18:25,287 --> 00:18:29,883
- Where the hell is he?
- You sure this is the right place?

155
00:18:35,567 --> 00:18:38,161
- You Muddy?.
- You the cops?

156
00:18:38,327 --> 00:18:42,559
No. Earl sent us. You know,
to take care of your wife.

157
00:18:42,727 --> 00:18:46,402
What the hell are you talking about?

158
00:18:46,567 --> 00:18:51,197
Who were those other two clowns?
Dammit!

159
00:18:51,367 --> 00:18:54,837
She did it to me again!
I'm kill all three of them!

160
00:18:55,007 --> 00:18:59,159
I noticed your TV was broken.
You wanna buy a new one?

161
00:19:03,487 --> 00:19:09,198
- Leave it. Worthless piece of crap.
- Let's start stealing from rich people.

162
00:21:14,887 --> 00:21:20,325
I'm sorry about that misunderstanding.
We didn't know you were hotel guests.

163
00:21:20,487 --> 00:21:25,607
- If there's anything we can do to ...
- Dammit. The thing's stuck.

164
00:21:25,767 --> 00:21:30,124
- It's attached to the ...
- Dumb-ass, let me try.

165
00:21:31,687 --> 00:21:35,236
That guy's still standing there.

166
00:21:35,407 --> 00:21:38,763
Could you, like, not stand there?

167
00:21:41,567 --> 00:21:45,321
- Some people are dumb.
- Yeah, really.

168
00:21:47,847 --> 00:21:50,725
Check it out, Beavis.

169
00:21:50,887 --> 00:21:54,243
I wonder where this goes.

170
00:21:54,407 --> 00:21:58,764
I think I hear a chick.

171
00:21:58,927 --> 00:22:01,566
Really?. Cool!

172
00:22:04,487 --> 00:22:07,957
Who are you? CIA? FBl? ATF?

173
00:22:08,127 --> 00:22:11,437
Hey, it's her!

174
00:22:12,727 --> 00:22:17,403
Hey, baby.
Are we, like, gonna do it?

175
00:22:17,567 --> 00:22:22,436
- You got two seconds.
- Is that gonna be enough time?

176
00:22:22,607 --> 00:22:25,405
- Who sent you?
- This drunk dude.

177
00:22:25,567 --> 00:22:28,684
He said he was gonna pay us to do you.

178
00:22:28,847 --> 00:22:33,841
Muddy ... son of a bitch.
What's he paying you?

179
00:22:34,007 --> 00:22:37,886
- Ten ...
- Ten grand?

180
00:22:38,047 --> 00:22:40,356
That cheap ass.

181
00:22:40,527 --> 00:22:45,078
I got a better deal for you.
I'll double it if you go back and do him.

182
00:22:45,247 --> 00:22:49,525
You want us to do a guy?.
No way.

183
00:22:49,687 --> 00:22:52,520
I don't know. That is a lot of money.

184
00:22:52,687 --> 00:22:55,724
Maybe if we pretend he's a chick ...

185
00:23:01,607 --> 00:23:05,680
Damn. You two wait right there.

186
00:23:07,207 --> 00:23:11,997
- I'm ready for love.
- I don't believe this.

187
00:23:21,447 --> 00:23:26,601
Give me the number
for Dream America Tours.

188
00:23:29,207 --> 00:23:33,166
You got a bus leaving today?.
Where's it going?

189
00:23:33,327 --> 00:23:38,845
Washington D.C. Five minutes?
Perfect. Give me two tickets.

190
00:23:39,007 --> 00:23:43,558
- No way, you always go first.
- We've never done this before.

191
00:23:47,687 --> 00:23:52,807
- Wanna ... you know ...
- ... do it? We're finally gonna score!

192
00:23:52,967 --> 00:23:57,916
Do it ..?
You guys wanna score?

193
00:24:02,927 --> 00:24:05,999
- You wait here.
- Bunghole!

194
00:24:38,847 --> 00:24:42,760
Don't wear yourselves out, boys.
Save some energy for me.

195
00:24:47,167 --> 00:24:52,605
- This is it. We're finally gonna score.
- Thank God.

196
00:24:52,767 --> 00:24:57,045
Oh yeah, we're gonna do it, all right.

197
00:24:59,527 --> 00:25:02,564
Boys ... boys ...

198
00:25:02,727 --> 00:25:05,525
Boys!

199
00:25:05,687 --> 00:25:10,886
First you have to do a little job for me.
Would you like to do a job for me?

200
00:25:11,047 --> 00:25:17,486
Here's what it is: I want you
to take the bus to Washington D.C.

201
00:25:17,647 --> 00:25:20,764
And when you get there, I'll be waiting.

202
00:25:20,927 --> 00:25:23,395
You'll make a lot of money.

203
00:25:23,567 --> 00:25:27,958
And I'm gonna give you everything.

204
00:25:29,607 --> 00:25:33,520
Until then, keep your pants on.

205
00:25:34,447 --> 00:25:38,281
Your bus is downstairs waiting,
so get going.

206
00:25:49,447 --> 00:25:53,122
This is gonna be cool.

207
00:26:01,287 --> 00:26:06,964
- I want the window.
- Why don't you take turns?

208
00:26:07,127 --> 00:26:13,077
- It's that slut from the plane.
- Oh, it's you two.

209
00:26:13,247 --> 00:26:18,162
- How'd you do in Las Vegas?
- We didn't score yet.

210
00:26:18,327 --> 00:26:23,117
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.
Me, I took a beating.

211
00:26:23,287 --> 00:26:25,676
Cool.

212
00:26:25,847 --> 00:26:30,523
So I'm bussing across America.
I'm so glad you're here.

213
00:26:30,687 --> 00:26:34,521
Jim, I want you to meet two nice boys.

214
00:26:34,687 --> 00:26:39,238
This is Travis and Bob.
What's your last name, dear?.

215
00:26:39,407 --> 00:26:43,366
Head.
My first name's Butt.

216
00:26:48,927 --> 00:26:51,964
Agent Flemming, ATF.

217
00:26:52,127 --> 00:26:56,882
Tell us where it is, or Agent Hurly
will give you another cavity search.

218
00:26:58,687 --> 00:27:03,636
- Is that a promise?
- We know who you are. Tell her, Bork.

219
00:27:03,807 --> 00:27:09,040
Dallas Grimes. Wife of Muddy Grimes.
You run an arms smuggling ring.

220
00:27:11,087 --> 00:27:13,521
You got my bad side.

221
00:27:13,687 --> 00:27:18,317
Three days ago you pulled a job
at the Army Research Facility.

222
00:27:18,487 --> 00:27:23,277
You stole the X-5 unit. You had it
with you when you checked in.

223
00:27:23,447 --> 00:27:26,280
Be a good girl and tell us where it is.

224
00:27:26,447 --> 00:27:30,520
You gonna charge me with anything?
I didn't think so.

225
00:27:30,687 --> 00:27:34,362
Should I have my lawyer
file a "wrongful arrest"?

226
00:27:34,527 --> 00:27:39,521
We got nothing. We can only hold her
for another few hours.

227
00:27:39,687 --> 00:27:42,326
Dammit! Cut her loose.
Where's that damn unit?

228
00:27:46,847 --> 00:27:50,283
We're in Washington.
We're gonna score now.

229
00:27:50,447 --> 00:27:54,679
Actually, we're at the Hoover Dam.

230
00:27:54,847 --> 00:28:00,399
- No, we're in Washington!
- We're gonna score now.

231
00:28:02,807 --> 00:28:07,244
Over 40,000 tons of concrete
were used to build the dam.

232
00:28:07,407 --> 00:28:10,319
The dam is 51 storeys high.

233
00:28:10,487 --> 00:28:15,117
It can generate
2.074 megawatts of electricity.

234
00:28:15,287 --> 00:28:19,326
But on the average,
it generates 25%%% of that.

235
00:28:19,487 --> 00:28:23,036
Anyone know how much energy
it takes to power Las Vegas?

236
00:28:23,207 --> 00:28:27,678
I have a question. Is this a god-dam?

237
00:28:32,247 --> 00:28:36,957
- Follow me this way.
- This is dumb. Let's go find that chick.

238
00:28:37,127 --> 00:28:40,244
Yeah, enough of this crap.
Check it out.

239
00:28:40,407 --> 00:28:43,126
- TV.
- Cool.

240
00:28:45,367 --> 00:28:50,282
I've got to hit the head.
Can you get me some coffee?

241
00:28:52,327 --> 00:28:54,124
Talk to me, Bork.

242
00:28:54,287 --> 00:28:58,439
A witness saw two boys leaving
Dallas' room shortly before we arrived.

243
00:28:58,607 --> 00:29:02,998
- Did you give him a cavity search?
- The witness?

244
00:29:03,167 --> 00:29:08,321
- You can never be too careful.
- I didn't think it was necessary.

245
00:29:08,487 --> 00:29:12,162
We have a picture of them
from the elevator security cam.

246
00:29:12,327 --> 00:29:16,366
They look like a couple of kids.

247
00:29:16,527 --> 00:29:20,315
Don't you realise
what kids today are capable of?

248
00:29:25,327 --> 00:29:31,641
- All they have is shows about water.
- They need some shows about fire.

249
00:29:31,807 --> 00:29:36,437
- What are you doing, Beavis?
- Something's wrong with my butt.

250
00:29:36,607 --> 00:29:38,563
Your butt sucks.

251
00:29:38,727 --> 00:29:43,039
- How come there's no sound?
- I'll fix it.

252
00:29:50,447 --> 00:29:54,042
There you go. Louder! Louder!

253
00:30:00,327 --> 00:30:04,445
"Master" ... Masturbation.

254
00:30:17,007 --> 00:30:22,639
It doesn't get any better than this.
This here's God's country. Unspoiled ...

255
00:30:27,407 --> 00:30:29,841
I think I found the remote.

256
00:30:32,687 --> 00:30:35,520
What the hell's going on?

257
00:30:42,007 --> 00:30:46,444
That's all I know. They got on the bus.
It was probably heading west.

258
00:30:46,607 --> 00:30:49,883
- Please!
- I'm gonna kill them!

259
00:30:53,047 --> 00:30:57,962
- That was boring.
- The same thing over and over again.

260
00:30:58,927 --> 00:31:03,637
We can't leave Washington
till we find that chick.

261
00:31:03,807 --> 00:31:08,835
We're a long ways from Washington.
This is the Hoover Dam.

262
00:31:09,007 --> 00:31:12,716
Dam ... I'll be damned.

263
00:31:17,407 --> 00:31:20,797
You boys better show up.

264
00:31:24,327 --> 00:31:27,125
- You see what I see, Bork?.
- I see it, I just don't get it.

265
00:31:27,287 --> 00:31:30,484
Half the state's looking for you,
how do you get away?.

266
00:31:30,647 --> 00:31:36,563
- Cut the power.
- We're dealing with pros. Terrorists.

267
00:31:36,727 --> 00:31:41,960
- What's the scoop on that stolen unit?
- It's not good. Roll the tape.

268
00:31:42,127 --> 00:31:47,406
The X-5 is a new biological weapon.
A man-made virus.

269
00:31:47,567 --> 00:31:51,606
The deadliest known to man.
It can wipe out five states in five days.

270
00:31:51,767 --> 00:31:56,204
Here's what happened
when it was tested on army recruits.

271
00:31:56,367 --> 00:32:01,680
Look at these guys. This thing
is a veritable doomsday device.

272
00:32:01,847 --> 00:32:05,760
If this were to fall into
the wrong hands ...

273
00:32:05,927 --> 00:32:13,117
And the casing is flawed. If hit hard,
it can break open, releasing the virus.

274
00:32:13,287 --> 00:32:17,246
These are the most dangerous men
in America.

275
00:32:17,407 --> 00:32:21,400
I want these faces in front of
every Fed and sheriff for 1 ,000 miles.

276
00:32:21,567 --> 00:32:26,766
The orders are, dead or alive.
Let's pray that nothing hits that unit.

277
00:32:28,207 --> 00:32:32,405
- Cut it out, Butt-head.
- I want to sit by the window.

278
00:32:32,567 --> 00:32:34,398
Next stop, Grand Canyon.

279
00:33:02,687 --> 00:33:05,884
It's like it's coming out of his ass.

280
00:33:06,047 --> 00:33:09,437
It's coming out of the ass of the ass.

281
00:33:09,607 --> 00:33:13,680
The poop's coming out
of the ass of the ass.

282
00:33:57,047 --> 00:34:01,643
There are over 200 active geysers
in Yellowstone Park.

283
00:34:01,807 --> 00:34:04,275
Old Faithful here is one of the largest.

284
00:34:04,447 --> 00:34:08,963
During an eruption, the water
can reach as high as 200 feet.

285
00:34:09,127 --> 00:34:10,924
So?

286
00:34:11,087 --> 00:34:18,243
The geyser shoots out 12,000 gallons
of water in a single eruption.

287
00:34:18,407 --> 00:34:21,797
- That's not that much.
- Let's get out of here.

288
00:34:23,087 --> 00:34:27,319
If you'll step over here,
the geyser is seconds away ...

289
00:34:31,927 --> 00:34:36,682
- It's incredible.
- Yeah, that's amazing.

290
00:34:36,847 --> 00:34:42,126
- That's incredible.
- That's amazing.

291
00:34:58,327 --> 00:35:01,080
Can't wait forever.

292
00:35:02,407 --> 00:35:05,558
Damn kids. No respect.

293
00:35:05,727 --> 00:35:09,003
They don't appreciate anything.
Oh, my God!

294
00:35:09,167 --> 00:35:15,322
Wait! Stop! Darn it.
Get me the police.

295
00:35:17,527 --> 00:35:20,963
This is the coolest thing I've ever seen.

296
00:35:23,407 --> 00:35:27,002
Chief, we got 'em. They're on a senior
citizens' tour bus going south on 89.

297
00:35:29,967 --> 00:35:32,117
That was great.

298
00:35:37,927 --> 00:35:41,602
Is this the right bus?

299
00:35:47,127 --> 00:35:53,646
Hey Beavis, we're on a bus with chicks.
Hey, baby.

300
00:35:57,687 --> 00:36:02,397
- They're not on the bus.
- I want full cavity searches.

301
00:36:02,567 --> 00:36:05,525
- Go deep on 'em.
- Agent Hurly.

302
00:36:05,687 --> 00:36:12,035
These guys are damn smart. They're
probably a hundred miles away by now.

303
00:36:20,607 --> 00:36:24,998
This book kicks ass.
There's a talking snake -

304
00:36:25,167 --> 00:36:31,276
- and a naked chick, and then
this dude puts a leaf on his schlong.

305
00:37:04,167 --> 00:37:09,799
- Check it out, porta-potties.
- Cool, I gotta take a dump.

306
00:37:13,407 --> 00:37:15,762
Where's the toilet?

307
00:37:23,407 --> 00:37:27,958
Forgive me, Father, I've sinned.
I slept with a woman.

308
00:37:28,127 --> 00:37:31,403
Really?. Was she naked?

309
00:37:31,567 --> 00:37:36,243
- Yes, Father. Please forgive me.
- Cool.

310
00:37:36,407 --> 00:37:39,205
Could you, like, see her boobs?

311
00:37:40,927 --> 00:37:45,079
- I'm sorry, how many Hail Marys?
- A thousand.

312
00:37:45,247 --> 00:37:50,879
And I want you to hit yourself
right now. Do it!

313
00:37:51,047 --> 00:37:54,722
Harder! Do it again!

314
00:38:05,727 --> 00:38:10,482
Welcome to the petrified forest, the
world's largestslte ofpetrified wood.

315
00:38:12,967 --> 00:38:14,719
"Wood".

316
00:38:14,887 --> 00:38:19,517
You may wonder,
how can wood getso hard?

317
00:38:20,967 --> 00:38:24,721
The wood became hard
over two million years ago.

318
00:38:43,207 --> 00:38:45,675
Wood ...

319
00:38:46,847 --> 00:38:51,841
- Hey, where'd those chicks go?
- I think you scared them off.

320
00:38:52,007 --> 00:38:54,999
This sucks. What are we doing here?

321
00:38:55,167 --> 00:38:57,806
I don't know.

322
00:38:59,087 --> 00:39:02,238
Do you know where Washington is?

323
00:39:02,407 --> 00:39:07,959
- About 2,000 miles that way.
- Cool. Thanks.

324
00:39:12,887 --> 00:39:18,120
Didn't see which way they went.
I don't suppose you tried to stop them?

325
00:39:18,287 --> 00:39:21,962
The most dangerous guys in America?
I make $9 an hour.

326
00:39:22,127 --> 00:39:26,598
National security is a responsibility
of every American. Bork ...

327
00:39:26,767 --> 00:39:30,316
- Cavity search?
- Deep and hard.

328
00:39:30,487 --> 00:39:35,720
I want roadblocks. Every road
out of here for 200 miles.

329
00:39:46,607 --> 00:39:50,156
This sucks. It's all hot and stuff.

330
00:39:50,327 --> 00:39:55,560
This desert is stupid. They need
to put a drinking fountain out here.

331
00:39:55,727 --> 00:39:58,560
Yeah, like a 7-1 1 or something.

332
00:40:04,207 --> 00:40:07,916
- Something wrong?
- We're looking for these two.

333
00:40:08,087 --> 00:40:13,115
That's them two kids
that have been whacking in my camper.

334
00:40:13,287 --> 00:40:19,078
- You saw these two?
- I never seen two kids whack so much.

335
00:40:19,247 --> 00:40:24,162
- Blue Den, I have positive ID.
- They're like two spider monkeys.

336
00:40:24,327 --> 00:40:30,721
- Please step out of the vehicle.
- But we're on our way to Washington ...

337
00:40:30,887 --> 00:40:32,081
Now!

338
00:40:34,327 --> 00:40:40,118
Wait right there. You're dealing with
a veteran of two foreign wars.

339
00:40:40,287 --> 00:40:45,202
If I find anything broken in there,
you and I are gonna tangle.

340
00:40:45,367 --> 00:40:50,441
Masturbating in a man's camper.
We're dealing with two sick individuals.

341
00:40:50,607 --> 00:40:54,236
I want that camper torn apart.
Full cavity searches all around.

342
00:40:54,407 --> 00:40:59,242
Something tells me
he could be involved.

343
00:40:59,407 --> 00:41:06,279
Chief, an airline had a problem with
someone calling himself Cornholio.

344
00:41:06,447 --> 00:41:11,202
- Guess who matches the description?
- Finally, a real break!

345
00:41:11,367 --> 00:41:13,961
Get that flight's point of origin.
We're gonna kick some ass.

346
00:41:26,087 --> 00:41:30,080
One of you bastards got a match?

347
00:41:30,247 --> 00:41:36,197
Yeah, my butt and your ... butt.

348
00:41:48,287 --> 00:41:52,565
Here's a song that might help you
cope with some of those feelings.

349
00:41:52,727 --> 00:41:56,322
It's called "Lesbian Seagull".

350
00:41:56,487 --> 00:42:01,402
She flies so gracefully
overrocks, trees and sand

351
00:42:03,647 --> 00:42:08,243
soaring over cliffs and gently
floating down to land

352
00:42:10,087 --> 00:42:15,878
she proudly lifts her voice
to sound the mating call

353
00:42:16,047 --> 00:42:22,156
and soon hermate responds
bysinging "caw, caw, caw"

354
00:42:22,927 --> 00:42:28,445
come wlth me
lesbian seagull

355
00:42:29,527 --> 00:42:33,486
settle down and rest wlth me

356
00:42:33,647 --> 00:42:38,243
flyhigh
lesbian seagull...

357
00:42:40,727 --> 00:42:44,163
That's him! He's their teacher!

358
00:42:44,327 --> 00:42:48,479
- What's going on here?
- I'll ask the questions.

359
00:42:48,647 --> 00:42:52,401
- Are these your students?
- I assume you're a government agent.

360
00:42:52,567 --> 00:42:57,402
You must know there's something in
this country called "due process".

361
00:42:57,567 --> 00:43:02,357
That's what I'd expect from the guy
who taught these two. Take him away.

362
00:43:02,527 --> 00:43:07,647
I believe I'm supposed to be read
my Miranda rights.

363
00:43:07,807 --> 00:43:13,245
- I always knew they were no good.
- Shut up.

364
00:43:13,407 --> 00:43:16,843
You've been harbouring
two criminal masterminds.

365
00:43:17,007 --> 00:43:19,362
You know that guy whose camper
they whacked off in?

366
00:43:19,527 --> 00:43:23,679
You represent the US Government.

367
00:43:23,847 --> 00:43:28,284
Never end a sentence
with a preposition.

368
00:43:28,447 --> 00:43:32,360
You know that guy,
in whose camper they ...

369
00:43:32,527 --> 00:43:37,123
That guy off in whose camper
they were whacking?

370
00:43:37,287 --> 00:43:42,566
We ran a sample through the sperm
bank. There's two possible fathers.

371
00:43:42,727 --> 00:43:46,163
Former Motley Crue roadies
turned drifters.

372
00:43:48,127 --> 00:43:52,598
- You were a roadie for Motley Crue?
- Yep.

373
00:43:54,567 --> 00:43:57,001
Fire.

374
00:43:57,167 --> 00:44:04,847
Here's another true story: 15 years ago,
we stopped in a toilet called Highland.

375
00:44:05,007 --> 00:44:07,919
Really?. That's where we're from.

376
00:44:08,087 --> 00:44:11,762
Then you know what I'm talking about.

377
00:44:11,927 --> 00:44:16,364
- I scored with these two chicks.
- Yeah, me too.

378
00:44:16,527 --> 00:44:21,317
- You scored with two chicks?
- Yeah, they were sluts.

379
00:44:24,887 --> 00:44:30,041
Shut up, dumb ass. You didn't score.
I scored with both of them.

380
00:44:30,207 --> 00:44:34,325
Do you think these two sluts
still live in Highland?

381
00:44:34,487 --> 00:44:37,559
That would be cool.

382
00:44:37,727 --> 00:44:41,800
You wanna see something really cool?

383
00:44:51,767 --> 00:44:54,281
Fire! Cool ...

384
00:45:06,647 --> 00:45:09,400
Where'd those guys go?

385
00:45:13,527 --> 00:45:19,602
- Are we almost there yet?
- Probably another five minutes or so.

386
00:45:37,127 --> 00:45:39,925
The sun sucks.

387
00:45:41,807 --> 00:45:44,765
Cut it out, butthole!

388
00:45:46,047 --> 00:45:51,724
Hey Butt-head, isn't there
supposed to be water in cactuses?

389
00:46:00,567 --> 00:46:05,436
Hey Beavis, check it out.

390
00:46:11,047 --> 00:46:15,677
No, I can't say that I've seen them.
I hope it's safe to drive around here.

391
00:46:15,847 --> 00:46:19,726
Just stick to the main roads.
They're probably hiding in the desert.

392
00:46:19,887 --> 00:46:22,481
That's good to know.

393
00:46:30,527 --> 00:46:36,875
- Hey Butt-head, are we gonna die?
- Probably.

394
00:46:39,767 --> 00:46:44,557
I think my life is, like,
flashing in front of my eyes.

395
00:46:56,727 --> 00:47:00,242
My life was cool.

396
00:47:03,487 --> 00:47:08,003
Wait a minute,
I think I'm seeing something, too.

397
00:47:08,167 --> 00:47:11,159
It's a really long time ago.

398
00:47:12,327 --> 00:47:15,558
This is gonna be cool.

399
00:47:17,087 --> 00:47:20,045
How's it going?

400
00:47:25,527 --> 00:47:28,803
Yeah, I scored.

401
00:47:29,967 --> 00:47:33,403
Butt-head, I'm starting to feel weird.

402
00:47:33,567 --> 00:47:36,764
- I think I'm freaking out.
- Okay.

403
00:47:36,927 --> 00:47:41,637
This is cool.
Everything looks all weird.

404
00:47:44,647 --> 00:47:50,404
There's all these weird shapes.
It's like a music video.

405
00:47:57,447 --> 00:47:59,961
What's going on?

406
00:48:20,287 --> 00:48:22,755
Fire! Fire!

407
00:49:32,407 --> 00:49:36,923
I'm all wet.
Cool ... water.

408
00:49:38,967 --> 00:49:43,518
I'm gonna enjoy this.
Any last words before I kill you?

409
00:49:45,607 --> 00:49:49,839
I have a couple.
"Butt-cheeks".

410
00:49:50,007 --> 00:49:54,558
And "boobs". I just want
to say that again. Boobs.

411
00:49:54,727 --> 00:49:59,482
- I'm gonna blow you both to hell!
- Cool.

412
00:49:59,647 --> 00:50:03,925
Beavis, that's that dude that's paying us
to do his wife.

413
00:50:04,087 --> 00:50:10,879
Can you take us to Washington?
We're gonna meet her there and ...

414
00:50:11,047 --> 00:50:14,164
That's where
she's meeting up with you?

415
00:50:14,327 --> 00:50:20,243
I just might need you boys after all.
Get in the trunk. Both of you. Now!

416
00:50:25,287 --> 00:50:29,326
- Boy, it sure is hard to score.
- Yeah, really.

417
00:50:39,727 --> 00:50:43,276
Hey Butt-head, check it out.
Ajack.

418
00:51:00,207 --> 00:51:02,960
"Jack".

419
00:51:12,727 --> 00:51:17,084
Hey Beavis, check it out.
I'm jacking off.

420
00:51:25,047 --> 00:51:28,835
Let's get out of here.

421
00:51:31,407 --> 00:51:34,717
You go first.

422
00:51:35,087 --> 00:51:38,875
I don't know,
that road's moving pretty fast.

423
00:51:39,047 --> 00:51:42,722
Just run really fast
as soon as you hit the ground. It'll work.

424
00:51:42,887 --> 00:51:46,721
- No way. You go.
- Don't be a wuss.

425
00:51:59,647 --> 00:52:01,763
That was cool.

426
00:52:10,327 --> 00:52:15,117
What I wouldn't give for five minutes
alone with them two bastards.

427
00:52:34,967 --> 00:52:39,324
Bob, the news out here is not good.
Authorities are calling this -

428
00:52:39,487 --> 00:52:42,797
- the worsthighway disaster
in the nation's history.

429
00:52:42,967 --> 00:52:46,243
Over 400 vehicles lay wrecked orstuck.

430
00:52:46,407 --> 00:52:51,117
- Chief, look!
- Well I'll be a blue-nosed gopher.

431
00:52:51,287 --> 00:52:56,566
- Where did they come from?
- The question's, where are they going?

432
00:52:56,727 --> 00:53:01,881
Representatives from G-PAC willmeet
in Washington tomorrow ...

433
00:53:02,047 --> 00:53:06,563
What the hell ..? Bork,
where was that bus heading?

434
00:53:06,727 --> 00:53:09,799
- D.C.
- Jesus jumped up ...

435
00:53:09,967 --> 00:53:13,926
What would happen
if they set that thing off in Washington?

436
00:53:14,087 --> 00:53:18,956
Or if they sold it to some foreigner
at that conference? It won't happen.

437
00:53:22,407 --> 00:53:25,922
This kicks ass.

438
00:53:27,527 --> 00:53:32,317
- Travis and Bob-head. Hello!
- Butt-head, it's that chick.

439
00:53:32,487 --> 00:53:35,445
Oh, yeah. Cool.

440
00:53:35,607 --> 00:53:40,442
Maybe they can take us to Washington
and we can finally score.

441
00:53:40,607 --> 00:53:45,727
- Isn't Seattle in Washington?
- Yep, it sure is.

442
00:53:45,887 --> 00:53:50,563
Cool. I'm thinking we can go see Hole
after we score.

443
00:53:51,607 --> 00:53:53,723
"Hole" ...

444
00:54:32,007 --> 00:54:35,602
Expecting somebody?.
Well, well ...

445
00:54:35,767 --> 00:54:41,797
Look at this. The love of my life.
Where have you been?

446
00:54:41,967 --> 00:54:46,438
Honey, I was gonna split it with you
after I sold it. I swear.

447
00:54:46,607 --> 00:54:49,963
But now you don't have to bother.

448
00:54:50,127 --> 00:54:55,326
Why don't we just forget about it
and go get a room, like old times?

449
00:54:55,487 --> 00:54:57,955
I don't think so. Where is it?

450
00:54:58,127 --> 00:55:03,884
Allsenators are requested for a vote.

451
00:55:04,047 --> 00:55:07,881
- Can I help you?
- We're looking for Washington.

452
00:55:08,047 --> 00:55:11,483
We're meeting a chick with big hooters.

453
00:55:11,647 --> 00:55:15,686
- You are in Washington.
- Really?. Where is she?

454
00:55:15,847 --> 00:55:19,237
Could you announce
that we're ready to score?

455
00:55:19,407 --> 00:55:22,399
No. Just a moment.

456
00:55:28,887 --> 00:55:35,565
Attention ... We're looking
for the chick wlth big boobs.

457
00:55:35,727 --> 00:55:39,197
Yeah, we are ready to do you now.

458
00:55:44,967 --> 00:55:50,564
In case you forget who you're dealing
with. I got your mules in my trunk.

459
00:55:51,807 --> 00:55:56,119
Damn! Damn!
I am gonna kill 'em!

460
00:55:56,287 --> 00:55:59,643
No, honey, we're gonna kill 'em.

461
00:56:01,527 --> 00:56:04,041
Next stop, White House.

462
00:56:09,127 --> 00:56:13,917
- Why are we getting back on the bus?
- It's time to go, son.

463
00:56:14,087 --> 00:56:18,922
We can't leave. What about that chick?.
We were supposed to get some.

464
00:56:19,087 --> 00:56:22,397
- Settle down, Beavis.
- No, I won't.

465
00:56:22,567 --> 00:56:27,846
Dammit, this always happens. I think
I'm gonna score, and then I never score.

466
00:56:28,007 --> 00:56:35,118
It's not fair. We travelled ... 100 miles
because we thought we'd score.

467
00:56:35,287 --> 00:56:37,847
- Sit down.
- Shut up, ass-wipe.

468
00:56:38,007 --> 00:56:45,197
We'll never score. We'll just get old like
these people, but they probably scored.

469
00:56:45,367 --> 00:56:47,039
Sit down!

470
00:56:47,207 --> 00:56:52,327
This chick's a slut. And this guy's old
but he probably scored a million times.

471
00:56:52,487 --> 00:56:57,607
- Oh, yeah.
- But not us. We're never gonna score!

472
00:56:57,767 --> 00:57:01,123
All right, that's it, numb-nuts.

473
00:57:08,407 --> 00:57:13,197
Well, look what we have here.
You two make me sick. Book 'em, Bork.

474
00:57:13,367 --> 00:57:17,679
- You don't have anything on us.
- How about lewd conduct?

475
00:57:17,847 --> 00:57:20,919
Maybe indecent exposure.

476
00:57:21,087 --> 00:57:26,320
One of you will get me the unit.
The other can spend 60 years in jail.

477
00:57:26,487 --> 00:57:29,877
We're back together,
and you'll never ...

478
00:57:30,047 --> 00:57:33,642
He stole the unit. He said
he put it in some kid's pants.

479
00:57:33,807 --> 00:57:37,117
You damn little four-legged ...

480
00:57:42,127 --> 00:57:46,643
Travis, it doesn't do a body good
to get all worked up.

481
00:57:46,807 --> 00:57:52,359
Here, this should help you relax.
Does that say "Xanax'?

482
00:57:54,567 --> 00:57:58,242
Yeah, probably. I don't know.

483
00:58:04,767 --> 00:58:07,440
What else you got?

484
00:58:16,167 --> 00:58:20,160
Our suspects are on a tour bus
we believe is heading for ...

485
00:58:20,327 --> 00:58:23,842
... the White House. Jumpin' Jesus!

486
00:58:24,007 --> 00:58:28,637
I want everyone there. Our people,
locals. Orders are: Shoot to kill.

487
00:58:50,967 --> 00:58:55,483
- You know what's really cool?
- Shut up.

488
00:59:03,927 --> 00:59:08,318
In case you don't know,
you've come on a very special day.

489
00:59:08,487 --> 00:59:14,119
Gathered today for a global conference
called Give Peace a Chance, G-PAC, -

490
00:59:14,287 --> 00:59:16,926
- are representatives
from around the world.

491
00:59:19,287 --> 00:59:24,441
Many of the portraits were saved from
the fire set by the British.

492
00:59:24,607 --> 00:59:29,397
- Fire ...
- What's your problem, Beavis?

493
00:59:30,767 --> 00:59:36,125
The site for the White House was
chosen by Washington and L'Enfant.

494
00:59:36,287 --> 00:59:39,962
L'Enfentatta tititatta for my bunghole.

495
00:59:40,127 --> 00:59:41,958
Are you okay?.

496
00:59:42,127 --> 00:59:46,917
Are you threatening me?
I am Cornholio.

497
00:59:47,087 --> 00:59:51,080
Maybe you should wait out in the lobby.

498
00:59:51,247 --> 00:59:58,039
In this lobby, will there be TP,
for my bunghole?

499
01:00:06,767 --> 01:00:10,123
Where are you when we need you, lke?

500
01:00:10,287 --> 01:00:14,166
Even with all we've been through,
it don't change a thing.

501
01:00:14,487 --> 01:00:20,323
I said it before and I'll say it again.
This is the greatest country on earth.

502
01:00:20,487 --> 01:00:25,402
Say, that looks kind of like ...
No, it couldn't be.

503
01:00:32,727 --> 01:00:36,640
Are you threatening me?
I am Cornholio.

504
01:00:36,807 --> 01:00:41,039
The President does plan to speak
at the conference.

505
01:00:41,207 --> 01:00:48,238
It's rumoured that a biological weapon
has been stolen during the conference.

506
01:00:48,407 --> 01:00:51,365
Those rumours are entirely unfounded.

507
01:00:56,727 --> 01:01:00,117
I am the great Cornholio.
I am a gringo.

508
01:01:00,287 --> 01:01:04,758
I have no bunghole.
Bungholio ...

509
01:01:13,607 --> 01:01:18,158
This is the state dining-room,
where world leaders are entertained.

510
01:01:18,327 --> 01:01:22,002
Where's the TV?

511
01:01:22,167 --> 01:01:27,639
- There are no TV's in the dining-room.
- This house sucks.

512
01:01:27,807 --> 01:01:33,165
Evacuation? It's probably
just another bomb threat or something.

513
01:01:37,167 --> 01:01:39,556
Is this the lobby?.

514
01:01:39,727 --> 01:01:45,324
I am Cornholio!
I need TP for my bunghole!

515
01:01:50,767 --> 01:01:55,795
- Yes, Mr President?
- I am Cornholio. Mybunghole goes ...

516
01:01:55,967 --> 01:01:59,562
Mr President, I can't make out
what you're saying.

517
01:02:02,407 --> 01:02:05,717
Sir, the President sounds strange.

518
01:02:05,887 --> 01:02:09,641
Washington may be under attack.
Go to defcon 4.

519
01:02:21,007 --> 01:02:23,441
Move it along, folks.

520
01:02:26,167 --> 01:02:29,239
Hey, baby.

521
01:02:31,607 --> 01:02:36,681
I noticed you have braces.
I have braces, too.

522
01:02:43,527 --> 01:02:47,520
That was cool.

523
01:02:47,687 --> 01:02:51,885
This is the coolest thing
I have ever seen.

524
01:02:52,047 --> 01:02:57,519
- All right, where's the unit?
- My unit?

525
01:02:57,687 --> 01:03:00,645
In my pants.

526
01:03:02,247 --> 01:03:06,763
- Not on him, Chief.
- Agent Hurly, give him a cavity search.

527
01:03:06,927 --> 01:03:10,920
Don't stop till you reach
the back of his teeth.

528
01:03:15,567 --> 01:03:18,843
- We're awaltingyour final order.
- Surrender your TP.

529
01:03:19,007 --> 01:03:25,196
Mr President, in the name of all that's
holy, I must have those launch codes.

530
01:03:28,007 --> 01:03:32,637
I am Cornholio!
You will cooperate with my bunghole.

531
01:03:32,807 --> 01:03:37,801
For there is but one bunghole.
The almighty Bunghole.

532
01:03:39,967 --> 01:03:43,243
He's clean, Chief.

533
01:03:43,407 --> 01:03:46,524
Did I just score?

534
01:03:46,687 --> 01:03:50,316
The other guy must have it.
He's here somewhere.

535
01:03:57,567 --> 01:03:59,398
... bunghole ...

536
01:04:05,607 --> 01:04:12,046
I'm sorry for the inconvenience, but
we'll have to wait outside. Follow me.

537
01:04:14,367 --> 01:04:18,599
- TP for my bunghole.
- Yes. TP for my bunghole. Pretty good.

538
01:04:21,087 --> 01:04:25,239
Let them through. They're with the
conference. It's okay, he's with them.

539
01:04:28,447 --> 01:04:32,440
You cannot run
from your own bunghole.

540
01:04:33,687 --> 01:04:36,360
Bunghole, bunghole, bunghole ...

541
01:05:01,127 --> 01:05:05,996
Boy, it really makes you proud.
I could stay in here all day.

542
01:05:06,167 --> 01:05:10,683
- Sir, you'll have to leave. Now.
- Wait a minute. That's enough.

543
01:05:10,847 --> 01:05:14,522
I planned this trip my whole life ...

544
01:05:14,687 --> 01:05:19,681
- Something about a "Cornholio".
- We haven't seen the Lincoln Room!

545
01:05:19,847 --> 01:05:25,399
Chief, isn't that the guy
whose camper they were whacking ...

546
01:05:25,567 --> 01:05:29,606
- Off in whose whacking camper ...
- Not now, Bork.

547
01:05:29,767 --> 01:05:33,760
This country's
going to hell in a hand basket.

548
01:05:33,927 --> 01:05:39,001
I'm gonna go right now
and talk to my congressman about this.

549
01:05:39,167 --> 01:05:43,240
What the hell ..?
Wait here a minute.

550
01:05:47,447 --> 01:05:50,996
What in the hell is that damn noise?

551
01:05:52,287 --> 01:05:56,678
- How's it going?
- Pull your damn pants up, boy!

552
01:05:56,847 --> 01:06:03,366
Get out! lf I ever catch you whacking
in here again, I'm gonna hog-tie you.

553
01:06:03,527 --> 01:06:07,645
Dammit,
now I got to straighten up in here!

554
01:06:07,807 --> 01:06:12,085
- We cleared all floors. No sign of him.
- Where the hell is he?

555
01:06:12,247 --> 01:06:17,002
- Chief, isn't that the camper ..?
- Bork, not now.

556
01:06:17,167 --> 01:06:21,843
- Chief, look.
- I'll be a monkey's bare-assed uncle.

557
01:06:22,007 --> 01:06:25,716
All units, we got him. He's in front of a
white camper on Pennsylvania Ave.

558
01:06:28,207 --> 01:06:32,041
I am Cornholio!
I will lay waste to your bunghole.

559
01:06:39,927 --> 01:06:43,522
Nobody shoot.
He could have the unit on him.

560
01:06:43,687 --> 01:06:47,760
Keep your distance.
We don't want to risk hitting it.

561
01:06:47,927 --> 01:06:51,522
- Where are his pants?
- Who knows?

562
01:06:52,887 --> 01:06:57,324
This is Agent Flemming. We won't
hurt you. We just want the unit.

563
01:07:05,367 --> 01:07:10,157
- Tell us where the unit is.
- Do you have TP for my bunghole?

564
01:07:10,327 --> 01:07:13,717
We'll get you whatever you want.
Get the other kid.

565
01:07:13,887 --> 01:07:18,915
- Do you have any holio?
- This is Bork. We need some TP.

566
01:07:19,087 --> 01:07:22,762
And some ... What did he say?.

567
01:07:23,727 --> 01:07:27,481
Whoa, this rules.

568
01:07:27,647 --> 01:07:30,207
Can I have a gun, too?

569
01:07:30,367 --> 01:07:34,440
You must bow down
to the almighty Bunghole.

570
01:07:36,407 --> 01:07:39,877
This is your last chance.
Give us the unit.

571
01:07:40,047 --> 01:07:44,882
Why does everybody
want to see my schlong?

572
01:07:48,767 --> 01:07:53,887
He's jerking us off. We have to
take him out. Fire on my orders.

573
01:07:54,047 --> 01:07:56,845
I am the one and only Bunghole!

574
01:07:57,007 --> 01:08:00,920
This is your last chance.
I'm gonna give you three seconds.

575
01:08:01,087 --> 01:08:05,638
Get ready to fire on the count of three.
One ...

576
01:08:05,807 --> 01:08:09,322
Would you like to see my bunghole?

577
01:08:09,487 --> 01:08:14,561
- I will show you my bunghole.
- Two!

578
01:08:14,727 --> 01:08:18,766
I have no bunghole.

579
01:08:19,807 --> 01:08:23,277
- What's going on?
- Three!

580
01:08:23,447 --> 01:08:27,440
- Take your damn pants with you!
- Hold your fire.

581
01:08:27,607 --> 01:08:32,727
- The pants! He's got the unit!
- Drop the pants, now!

582
01:08:32,887 --> 01:08:35,765
Wait a minute. I ain't the one ...

583
01:09:00,567 --> 01:09:04,196
Here you go.

584
01:09:07,967 --> 01:09:11,721
- Wait just a minute, mister!
- Take a look at this.

585
01:09:11,887 --> 01:09:15,846
- How do you explain this?
- What the hell are you talking about?

586
01:09:16,007 --> 01:09:20,717
Using two innocent teenagers
as pawns in your sick game, huh?

587
01:09:20,887 --> 01:09:24,926
- I don't know what this is about.
- Take him away.

588
01:09:25,087 --> 01:09:29,638
Get your damn hands off me!

589
01:09:34,247 --> 01:09:39,685
You don't know who you're dealing
with. I'm a veteran of two foreign wars.

590
01:09:39,847 --> 01:09:42,236
I ain't the one.

591
01:09:42,767 --> 01:09:47,079
I always thought
there was something wrong with him.

592
01:09:47,247 --> 01:09:52,844
- He had a lot of problems.
- He used to hit me, too.

593
01:09:53,007 --> 01:09:57,603
Hey, does anyone want to see my unit?

594
01:10:00,087 --> 01:10:04,365
I got to admit it, I had you boys wrong.
I thought you were scum.

595
01:10:04,527 --> 01:10:10,204
But you saved more lives today
than you'll ever know.

596
01:10:10,367 --> 01:10:15,805
- This country owes you a debt.
- You mean, we get money and stuff?

597
01:10:15,967 --> 01:10:19,755
And chicks.
We were supposed to score.

598
01:10:19,927 --> 01:10:23,920
For security reasons, your actions
have to remain top secret, -

599
01:10:24,087 --> 01:10:27,682
- but someone very special
wants to give you his thanks.

600
01:10:29,327 --> 01:10:33,843
Beavis and Butt-head,
on behalf of your fellow Americans -

601
01:10:34,007 --> 01:10:40,116
- I extend my thanks. You exemplify
a fine new crop of young Americans -

602
01:10:40,287 --> 01:10:44,678
- who will grow into the leaders
of this great country.

603
01:10:44,847 --> 01:10:47,998
He said "extend".

604
01:10:48,167 --> 01:10:53,161
In recognition of your great service,
I'm appointing you honorary agents -

605
01:10:53,327 --> 01:10:57,764
- in the Bureau of Alcohol,
Tobacco and Firearms.

606
01:10:57,927 --> 01:11:02,398
- Alcohol and tobacco?
- Yeah, and firearms.

607
01:11:02,567 --> 01:11:05,764
- Cool, huh?
- Cigarettes and beer kick ass.

608
01:11:05,927 --> 01:11:10,796
We're in the Bureau of Beer
and Fire and Cigarettes.

609
01:11:10,967 --> 01:11:15,324
- And maybe some chicks, too.
- This is gonna be cool.

610
01:11:24,327 --> 01:11:29,959
You know what sucks? We never
scored and we never got any money.

611
01:11:30,127 --> 01:11:36,043
- And my butt's still sore ...
- Butt-head, look!

612
01:11:36,207 --> 01:11:39,643
Yes! Yes!

613
01:11:49,607 --> 01:11:53,156
You think we're ever gonna score?

614
01:11:53,327 --> 01:11:58,799
I probably will. But not you.
You're too much of a butt-monkey.

615
01:11:58,967 --> 01:12:02,880
- Shut up, dill-hole.
- Butt-dumpling.

616
01:12:03,047 --> 01:12:08,121
- Turd-burglar.
- Ass-goblin.

617
01:12:08,287 --> 01:12:13,520
Shut up. Hey, doesn't Tom Anderson
live on this street?

618
01:12:14,927 --> 01:12:20,524
I need to stop by his tool shed
for a couple of minutes.

619
01:12:22,607 --> 01:12:24,916
"Tool" ...
