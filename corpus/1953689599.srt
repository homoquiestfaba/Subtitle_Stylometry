<i>We are giving you</i>

<i>The incidents, the places,</i>

19
00:03:07,488 --> 00:03:10,956
<i>my friend, we cannot keep</i>
<i>as a secret any longer.</i>

20
00:03:10,958 --> 00:03:13,125
<i>Let us punish the guilty.</i>

21
00:03:13,127 --> 00:03:16,128
<i>Let us reward the innocent.</i>

22
00:03:16,130 --> 00:03:19,565
<i>My friend,</i>

<i>the shocking facts about...</i>

24
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:29,675
<i>Only moments ago, after five</i>

<i>Thanks to an anonymous tip,</i>

28
00:03:36,984 --> 00:03:38,917

I'm just trying to find

36
00:04:07,214 --> 00:04:09,548
Get back into bed.

37
00:04:09,550 --> 00:04:11,216
Oh, I'll be there.

Wh-what?

44
00:04:37,344 --> 00:04:38,777
Where are you going?

45
00:04:38,779 --> 00:04:42,781
I'm gonna take my grandma
to the Star Trek convention.

00:04:42,783 --> 00:04:45,550
What the fuck, are you
fucking recording me?

Are you fucking serious?
Shit!

49
00:04:48,455 --> 00:04:49,521
Give me that camera back.

50
00:04:49,523 --> 00:04:51,256
A bold remark, Miss Stewart.

51
00:04:51,258 --> 00:04:54,059
Hello, my name
is Cameron Townes.

52
00:04:54,061 --> 00:04:55,427
And I'm working
on a documentary

53
00:04:55,429 --> 00:04:58,830
about the greatest 21st
birthday trip to Las Vegas

54
00:04:58,832 --> 00:05:02,267
in the history
of 21st birthday--

55
00:05:02,269 --> 00:05:04,670
Yo, brown bag special,
shut it, man.

56
00:05:04,672 --> 00:05:06,038
<i>[Townes] You're ruining</i>
<i>your intro</i>

57
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:07,239
<i>to your birthday video.</i>

58
00:05:07,241 --> 00:05:09,041
No shit, I brought him

59
00:05:09,043 --> 00:05:11,610
so you could have this
to remember.

60
00:05:11,612 --> 00:05:14,313
<i>[Townes] No shit, this is</i>
<i>Graham, he's the birthday boy.</i>

61
00:05:14,315 --> 00:05:16,315
But I love this man.

62
00:05:16,317 --> 00:05:18,650
Not-- there's not many people
out there that'll go out...

63
00:05:18,652 --> 00:05:21,620
<i>How is he related</i>
<i>to this guy--</i>

64
00:05:21,622 --> 00:05:25,891
and do a full brown out
in fucking Vegas!

65
00:05:25,893 --> 00:05:28,126
Brown is the way
to the woman's heart.

66
00:05:28,128 --> 00:05:30,962
It is, I agree, I've done
the brown out before.

67
00:05:30,964 --> 00:05:32,664
My shoes are brown, as well.

68
00:05:32,666 --> 00:05:34,533
They're made outta hemp.

69
00:05:35,768 --> 00:05:37,903
Because--
<i>...or a rapist.</i>

70
00:05:37,905 --> 00:05:40,572
<i>One, you need to stop dressing</i>
<i>like a boy scout</i>

71
00:05:40,574 --> 00:05:42,040
<i>and two, you need</i>
<i>to stop saying things</i>

72
00:05:42,042 --> 00:05:44,876
<i>like, you know, it's not--</i>
<i>But, this is actually--</i>

73
00:05:44,878 --> 00:05:46,978
<i>How those are bong rips</i>
<i>treating you up there?</i>

74
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:49,614
Not, good there, Cameron.

75
00:05:49,616 --> 00:05:50,816
<i>Maybe that's because</i>
<i>it's like,</i>

76
00:05:50,818 --> 00:05:52,184
<i>eight in the morning</i>
<i>or something.</i>

77
00:05:52,186 --> 00:05:54,419
You know what, smoking weed
at eight in the morning

78
00:05:54,421 --> 00:05:57,055
is actually the greatest thing
ever invented.

79
00:05:57,057 --> 00:06:00,125
Who, someone invented smoking
weed at eight in the morning?

80
00:06:00,127 --> 00:06:02,094
I think it might have
been Freud.

81
00:06:02,096 --> 00:06:03,995
Freud, Sigmund Freud.

82
00:06:03,997 --> 00:06:06,231
Sigmund Freud,
you mean Siegfried?

83
00:06:06,233 --> 00:06:08,100
No, not--
<i>Siegfried and Roy--</i>

84
00:06:08,102 --> 00:06:09,801
Not the tiger,
no, I'm talking about--

85
00:06:09,803 --> 00:06:11,703
<i>That's what we're going</i>
<i>to see, dude.</i>

86
00:06:11,705 --> 00:06:13,071
<i>You guys are fucking stupid.</i>

87
00:06:13,073 --> 00:06:14,172
Did you get tickets
for Siegfried and Roy?
Yes.

88
00:06:14,174 --> 00:06:16,274
<i>You got that in common,</i>
<i>at least.</i>

89
00:06:16,276 --> 00:06:17,509
I think I smoked too much.

90
00:06:17,511 --> 00:06:18,510
What?

91
00:06:18,512 --> 00:06:19,811
<i>Oh, shit.</i>

92
00:06:19,813 --> 00:06:20,879
I'm gonna fucking puke.

93
00:06:20,881 --> 00:06:22,814
I'm not even
on the road yet, dude.

94
00:06:22,816 --> 00:06:23,815
<i>Don't puke in my car, dude.</i>

95
00:06:23,817 --> 00:06:25,384
What a fucking pussy.

96
00:06:25,386 --> 00:06:26,718
I'm serious, don't puke
in my car.

97
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,153
<i>He's gonna blow,</i>
<i>he's gonna blow.</i>

98
00:06:28,155 --> 00:06:30,255
<i>Do what you want-- puke.</i>

99
00:06:30,257 --> 00:06:31,723
<i>Close.</i>

100
00:06:31,725 --> 00:06:34,893
<i>Puke.</i>
<i>Don't puke.</i>

101
00:06:34,895 --> 00:06:36,061
I'm actually gonna puke.

102
00:06:36,063 --> 00:06:38,530
<i>I know-- puke.</i>

103
00:06:38,532 --> 00:06:39,965
<i>I wanna see it.</i>

104
00:06:39,967 --> 00:06:43,769
<i>[both] Oh, shit!</i>

105
00:06:43,771 --> 00:06:46,738
<i>What the fuck did you eat?</i>

106
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:48,507
Something pink.

107
00:06:49,976 --> 00:06:50,976
So,

108
00:06:50,978 --> 00:06:52,511
<i>Anyway,</i>

109
00:06:52,513 --> 00:06:55,013
As I was saying, I don't think
I even need to give an intro

110
00:06:55,015 --> 00:06:57,549
to the trip anything more
after our buddy, Graham here

111
00:06:57,551 --> 00:06:59,017
just set it up for us.

112
00:06:59,019 --> 00:07:01,420
Let's go pick up Tommy Kay.

113
00:07:01,422 --> 00:07:03,989
Ho, ho, ho, hee.
That was good.

114
00:07:03,991 --> 00:07:06,691
<i>Cameron, you didn't say</i>
<i>he fucking worked here.</i>

115
00:07:06,693 --> 00:07:08,460
[speaks Spanish]

116
00:07:08,462 --> 00:07:10,829
What the fuck?

117
00:07:10,831 --> 00:07:11,897
<i>What's going on?</i>

118
00:07:11,899 --> 00:07:14,065
How are you all doing?

119
00:07:14,067 --> 00:07:16,234
What's up with the camera?

120
00:07:16,236 --> 00:07:17,302
<i>Can you take five?</i>

121
00:07:17,304 --> 00:07:19,337
Tommy Kay, baby,
the opposite of gay.

122
00:07:19,339 --> 00:07:20,372
Get it straight.

123
00:07:20,374 --> 00:07:22,207
<i>Hey, can you take five?</i>
<i>What?</i>

124
00:07:22,209 --> 00:07:23,542
<i>Can you take five?</i>
<i>We need to talk.</i>

125
00:07:23,544 --> 00:07:24,643
<i>We gotta talk right now.</i>

126
00:07:24,645 --> 00:07:25,944
About what, how?

127
00:07:25,946 --> 00:07:27,746
You guys are not going
to get me fired from my job?

128
00:07:27,748 --> 00:07:29,481
This shirt come
with this job

129
00:07:29,483 --> 00:07:31,183
or did you have
to buy it yourself?

130
00:07:31,185 --> 00:07:34,586
<i>Tommy, Tommy,</i>
<i>can you hear me?</i>

131
00:07:34,588 --> 00:07:37,255
Tommy Kay has no idea
we're about to yank his ass

132
00:07:37,257 --> 00:07:39,357
out of this job
and take him to Vegas.

133
00:07:39,359 --> 00:07:40,959
He says no--

134
00:07:42,061 --> 00:07:43,562
You guys are gonna
get me fired, bro.

135
00:07:43,564 --> 00:07:44,930
Hop on, hop on.

136
00:07:44,932 --> 00:07:46,731
Who's gonna see this?

137
00:07:46,733 --> 00:07:48,066
You guys are gonna get me fired.

138
00:07:48,068 --> 00:07:49,134
No, no, no.

139
00:07:49,136 --> 00:07:50,268
Come on, let's go.

140
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:52,003
No, no, no, you're gonna
get me fired, dude.

141
00:07:52,005 --> 00:07:53,605
You 21?

142
00:07:53,607 --> 00:07:57,108
Happy mother fuckin' birthday.

143
00:07:57,110 --> 00:07:59,611
Don't stay too close 'cause it
gives me a wide angle like,

144
00:07:59,613 --> 00:08:00,846
distortion of my face.

145
00:08:00,848 --> 00:08:02,080
We're going to Vegas.

146
00:08:02,082 --> 00:08:03,248
You always do this, man.

147
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:05,016
I'm not going.

148
00:08:05,018 --> 00:08:06,351
I'm not going.
We're going to Vegas.

149
00:08:06,353 --> 00:08:07,419
I'm not going.

150
00:08:07,421 --> 00:08:08,820
Yeah, you are.
Wanna see the move, man?

151
00:08:08,822 --> 00:08:10,489
<i>We're going.</i>
<i>I am not going like this.</i>

152
00:08:10,491 --> 00:08:11,723
It's my fuckin' birthday.

153
00:08:11,725 --> 00:08:13,959
<i>We got you clothes, man,</i>
<i>let's go.</i>

154
00:08:13,961 --> 00:08:16,862
Come on, Tommy,
we don't have time, dude.

155
00:08:16,864 --> 00:08:17,929
Let's do it!

156
00:08:17,931 --> 00:08:19,197
You got Matt Hardy?
<i>You know it.</i>

157
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:21,032
Even though I could pick up
women with anything,

158
00:08:21,034 --> 00:08:23,068
I don't wanna be, you know--

159
00:08:23,070 --> 00:08:24,336
Stop that.

160
00:08:24,338 --> 00:08:26,037
Why do I have
my apron on right now?

161
00:08:26,039 --> 00:08:28,139
<i>It's all right,</i>
<i>you're fired already.</i>

162
00:08:28,141 --> 00:08:29,574
Just keep it.

163
00:08:29,576 --> 00:08:31,309
Dude, your dad better
give me a job then.

164
00:08:31,311 --> 00:08:32,410
I'm not playing.

165
00:08:32,412 --> 00:08:34,212
<i>Just keep that hair net</i>
<i>on all night.</i>

166
00:08:34,214 --> 00:08:36,481
<i>Take it off.</i>
<i>Oh, shit.</i>

167
00:08:36,483 --> 00:08:37,716
You got gel?

168
00:08:37,718 --> 00:08:39,217
Yeah, we got gel.
Where's the gel?

169
00:08:39,219 --> 00:08:41,019
Projectile vomited.

170
00:08:41,021 --> 00:08:43,889
Like, all over the street.

171
00:08:43,891 --> 00:08:46,591
Almost in the car,
we almost had to kick his ass.

172
00:08:46,593 --> 00:08:48,693
It was like gray
and amber, dude.

173
00:08:48,695 --> 00:08:50,428
How'd he throw up?

174
00:08:50,430 --> 00:08:53,565
I don't know, I guess
I smoked too much or something.

175
00:08:53,567 --> 00:08:55,267
Are you bulimic?

176
00:08:55,269 --> 00:08:57,035
Not bulimic, he was sick.

177
00:08:57,037 --> 00:08:58,703
<i>What do you mean?</i>

178
00:08:58,705 --> 00:09:00,438
Yeah, I took theater class
in middle school,

179
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:01,606
but you wouldn't know
about that.

180
00:09:01,608 --> 00:09:04,776
Anyways, um, and action.

181
00:09:04,778 --> 00:09:07,546
Hey, guys, this is
Tommy Kay reporting

182
00:09:07,548 --> 00:09:10,048
from the back seat
of the ca-- of the car.

183
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:11,616
<i>[giggling]</i>

184
00:09:12,618 --> 00:09:14,185
I'll-- I'll finish.

185
00:09:14,187 --> 00:09:16,221
My friend, Graham,

186
00:09:17,423 --> 00:09:19,024
is bulimic.

187
00:09:19,026 --> 00:09:20,659
And I'm gonna call him out
on his shit

188
00:09:20,661 --> 00:09:21,693
'cause that's what
friends do.

189
00:09:21,695 --> 00:09:22,928
I'm-- I'm a little worried now.

190
00:09:22,930 --> 00:09:24,563
<i>A little bit.</i>

191
00:09:24,565 --> 00:09:26,264
What do you want me
to fuckin' say?

192
00:09:26,266 --> 00:09:28,733
I fuckin' smoked
a little bit of weed--

193
00:09:28,735 --> 00:09:30,502
okay, a lot of bit of weed

194
00:09:30,504 --> 00:09:35,040
and I fuckin' had
my cranberry scone

195
00:09:35,042 --> 00:09:38,009
like I do every morning.

196
00:09:38,011 --> 00:09:39,911
I mean, you shouldn't
be vomiting.

197
00:09:39,913 --> 00:09:41,780
It was pink, for God sakes.

198
00:09:41,782 --> 00:09:45,016
Yeah, because I had a fuckin'
cranberry scone, dick!

199
00:09:45,018 --> 00:09:49,120
Does Cameron have a rape face?

200
00:09:49,122 --> 00:09:50,889
Now, put the camera
in your face really quick.

201
00:09:50,891 --> 00:09:54,192
<i>And tell me, you should have</i>
<i>played</i> American Psycho.

202
00:09:54,194 --> 00:09:56,595
[whispers] Did you make her?
Hey, Capri.

203
00:09:56,597 --> 00:09:57,796
<i>[Capri] Hey, Luke.</i>

204
00:09:57,798 --> 00:10:00,565
Hey, Capri, baby,
boo-boo bear, no, no, yes.

205
00:10:00,567 --> 00:10:02,534
<i>[Capri on phone]</i>

206
00:10:02,536 --> 00:10:04,536
[no audible dialog]

207
00:10:06,572 --> 00:10:09,474
[chuckles] You want us
to take you to Vegas

208
00:10:09,476 --> 00:10:10,609
so you can see Jake?

209
00:10:10,611 --> 00:10:12,010
That sounds like more
of a gift for you

210
00:10:12,012 --> 00:10:13,244
than a gift for me.
On my brother's birthday?

211
00:10:13,246 --> 00:10:18,016
<i>[Capri on phone]</i>
<i>[no audible dialog]</i>

212
00:10:18,018 --> 00:10:21,553
Does she have-- does she have
women with her?

213
00:10:21,555 --> 00:10:22,721
<i>[Capri] Hello?</i>
<i>[whispers] Ask her.</i>

214
00:10:22,723 --> 00:10:23,855
Yeah.

215
00:10:23,857 --> 00:10:25,090
What?

216
00:10:25,092 --> 00:10:26,391
We'll be there in 20.

217
00:10:26,393 --> 00:10:28,126
<i>No.</i>
<i>No, no.</i>

218
00:10:28,128 --> 00:10:29,260
I'll see you in a minute.

219
00:10:29,262 --> 00:10:33,031
<i>What the fuck, dude?</i>
<i>[clamoring]</i>

220
00:10:33,033 --> 00:10:34,366
She's not my friend.

221
00:10:34,368 --> 00:10:36,001
You still play pancake at 22.

222
00:10:36,003 --> 00:10:38,536
What is pancake?

223
00:10:38,538 --> 00:10:40,305
This is so gay, dude.

224
00:10:40,307 --> 00:10:42,607
We're backtracking
to go pick up pancake.

225
00:10:42,609 --> 00:10:44,809
Get off, I'm not--
What is pancake?

226
00:10:44,811 --> 00:10:47,045
Patty-cake?
Oh, patty-cake.

227
00:10:47,047 --> 00:10:48,046
No, fuck off.

228
00:10:48,048 --> 00:10:49,581
Yeah, you see, you know now.

229
00:10:49,583 --> 00:10:51,316
Okay, I play,

230
00:10:51,318 --> 00:10:53,385
because I'm the only one
who's got quick enough hands

231
00:10:53,387 --> 00:10:54,452
to do the fucking patty-cake.

232
00:10:54,454 --> 00:10:55,553
<i>Graham, reject me</i>
<i>one more time,</i>

233
00:10:55,555 --> 00:10:56,554
<i>see what happens--</i>
<i>just one time.</i>

234
00:10:56,556 --> 00:10:58,623
<i>See watch.</i>

235
00:10:58,625 --> 00:11:01,726
Whoa, God, you're pinching me,
you fucking weirdo!

236
00:11:01,728 --> 00:11:03,561
Tommy?
Oh, my God.

237
00:11:03,563 --> 00:11:05,096
<i>Were you worried they were</i>
<i>going to send you</i>

238
00:11:05,098 --> 00:11:06,731
<i>back across the border?</i>

239
00:11:06,733 --> 00:11:08,466
I'm not Mexican, dude.

240
00:11:08,468 --> 00:11:09,901
I'm-- I'm from Illinois.

241
00:11:09,903 --> 00:11:11,202
<i>Same difference.</i>

242
00:11:11,204 --> 00:11:12,671
Happy birthday, Graham!

243
00:11:12,673 --> 00:11:16,141
You don't get
anything you want.
What does it matter?

244
00:11:16,143 --> 00:11:18,777
Because we were going to have
the fucking four of us, man!
It doesn't matter.

245
00:11:18,779 --> 00:11:20,879
She's gonna ride with us and
then we're gonna drop her off.

246
00:11:20,881 --> 00:11:23,181
You can't-- I don't understand
why you're so mad, Graham?

247
00:11:23,183 --> 00:11:24,349
It's not-- it's not a big deal.

248
00:11:24,351 --> 00:11:26,051
<i>See, you're not a big deal.</i>

249
00:11:26,053 --> 00:11:27,886
Tommy Kay's down with it.

250
00:11:27,888 --> 00:11:30,055
Bro, I'm gonna fuckin'
sock you in the mouth.

251
00:11:30,057 --> 00:11:31,089
Tommy Kay, you weren't even
gonna fucking come.

252
00:11:31,091 --> 00:11:32,524
You were gonna fucking
flip pizzas

253
00:11:32,526 --> 00:11:34,392
for the rest
of the fuckin' week.

254
00:11:34,394 --> 00:11:37,429
Yeah, you weren't
gonna fucking come.

255
00:11:37,431 --> 00:11:38,530
All right, I'm sorry.

256
00:11:38,532 --> 00:11:40,832
Can you stay quiet for a second?
I need a vent.

257
00:11:40,834 --> 00:11:43,468
I don't ha-- and back to me.

258
00:11:43,470 --> 00:11:45,336
I don't have a fade.

259
00:11:45,338 --> 00:11:47,138
I don't feel comfortable
with the shirt.

260
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:49,240
I can tell when you're lying
to me, go ahead.

261
00:11:49,242 --> 00:11:50,575
Okay, go ahead.

262
00:11:50,577 --> 00:11:51,776
You feel happy now?

263
00:11:51,778 --> 00:11:53,445
<i>This is the--</i>
<i>this is the hospital</i>

264
00:11:53,447 --> 00:11:54,913
where Graham was born.

265
00:11:54,915 --> 00:11:56,181
Quick, get a shot of that.

266
00:11:56,183 --> 00:11:57,849
<i>That's beautiful.</i>
<i>[laughs]</i>

267
00:11:57,851 --> 00:11:59,117
<i>It's brown too.</i>

268
00:11:59,119 --> 00:12:00,452
<i>We goin' to Vegas?</i>

269
00:12:00,454 --> 00:12:02,721
<i>Let's go to Vegas.</i>
<i>Yes, we're going to Vegas.</i>

270
00:12:02,723 --> 00:12:03,888
<i>Let's get pumped up.</i>

271
00:12:03,890 --> 00:12:04,889
Whatever.

272
00:12:04,891 --> 00:12:06,357
Vegas on three, Cam.

273
00:12:06,359 --> 00:12:07,625
<i>On three-- Vegas.</i>

274
00:12:07,627 --> 00:12:10,695
[all] one, two, three.
[shouting] Go.

275
00:12:10,697 --> 00:12:12,464
All right, for everybody's
information,

276
00:12:12,466 --> 00:12:14,766
moving on down the road.

277
00:12:14,768 --> 00:12:17,135
We got a little stowaway
in the back seat now though,

278
00:12:17,137 --> 00:12:21,439
because somebody
just had to tag along.

279
00:12:21,441 --> 00:12:24,275
Guilty, right there.

280
00:12:24,277 --> 00:12:26,444
You know you wanted me
to come, don't lie.

281
00:12:26,446 --> 00:12:28,413
Oh, and I came bearing gifts.

282
00:12:28,415 --> 00:12:29,914
What are you drawing over there?

283
00:12:29,916 --> 00:12:33,551
<i>Oh, that's so sweet.</i>

284
00:12:33,553 --> 00:12:35,653
If...

285
00:12:35,655 --> 00:12:37,088
them two were to have a kid,

286
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:38,223
this is how it would look like.

287
00:12:38,225 --> 00:12:39,424
<i>I agree.</i>

288
00:12:39,426 --> 00:12:41,626
His name is Pepe.

289
00:12:41,628 --> 00:12:43,228
<i>Oh, shit.</i>

290
00:12:45,231 --> 00:12:47,532
We're all gonna die, we're never
gonna make it to Vegas.

291
00:12:49,969 --> 00:12:51,302
<i>Okay, say something.</i>

292
00:12:51,304 --> 00:12:52,604
Um, [clears throat]

293
00:12:52,606 --> 00:12:55,774
<i>Why are you here,</i>
<i>where did you come from?</i>

294
00:12:55,776 --> 00:13:00,111
Because I am going
to go see my boyfriend.

295
00:13:00,113 --> 00:13:01,513
And you guys
are giving me a ride.

296
00:13:01,515 --> 00:13:03,548
So kindly, my good friends.

297
00:13:03,550 --> 00:13:05,316
Can I draw a dinosaur
on your cheek?

298
00:13:05,318 --> 00:13:07,485
He's holdin' the camera.

299
00:13:07,487 --> 00:13:09,454
You're holdin' the camera,
it's my turn to play.

300
00:13:09,456 --> 00:13:11,422
[clamor]

301
00:13:11,424 --> 00:13:12,824
You're not here.

302
00:13:12,826 --> 00:13:14,058
<i>You need to practice</i>
<i>invisibility--</i>

303
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:15,527
Okay, I'm tired
of the attitude.

304
00:13:15,529 --> 00:13:17,562
<i>We're pretending</i>
<i>that you don't exist.</i>

305
00:13:17,564 --> 00:13:19,430
Why are you guys so mean then?

306
00:13:19,432 --> 00:13:20,598
You exist, I see you.

307
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:21,900
<i>This was a dude's trip.</i>

308
00:13:21,902 --> 00:13:23,134
<i>Dude's trip only.</i>

309
00:13:23,136 --> 00:13:25,036
<i>And you are gay for sure now.</i>

310
00:13:25,038 --> 00:13:26,437
How am I gay?

311
00:13:26,439 --> 00:13:27,672
<i>You're sucking your banana.</i>

312
00:13:27,674 --> 00:13:31,009
Just because
he has feelings, okay?

313
00:13:31,011 --> 00:13:34,345
<i>Gay, gay.</i>
<i>Stop!--</i>

314
00:13:34,347 --> 00:13:37,749
Yo, fuckface, film me humpin'
the fuckin' stegosaur.

315
00:13:37,751 --> 00:13:38,950
<i>The what?</i>

316
00:13:38,952 --> 00:13:39,951
<i>Get it, dude.</i>

317
00:13:39,953 --> 00:13:42,353
<i>What'd he say?</i>

318
00:13:42,355 --> 00:13:44,856
Yeah, you like that?
<i>Yeah, man.</i>

319
00:13:44,858 --> 00:13:47,692
You gotta thrust
the hips, though.

320
00:13:47,694 --> 00:13:50,895
<i>Hey, easy dude, don't bust a</i>
<i>nut on this thing.</i>

321
00:13:50,897 --> 00:13:53,164
<i>Hey, Graham.</i>

322
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:55,567
Oh, boy.

323
00:13:55,569 --> 00:13:56,668
You wanna hump
this thing?

324
00:13:56,670 --> 00:13:57,936
<i>Yes, I wanna hump that thing.</i>

325
00:13:57,938 --> 00:13:59,804
Oh, yeah, get some.

326
00:14:01,273 --> 00:14:02,941
Hey, wait your turn, buddy.

327
00:14:02,943 --> 00:14:04,008
All right, all right.

328
00:14:08,781 --> 00:14:09,881
No pleasure for the dinosaur.

329
00:14:09,883 --> 00:14:11,816
You're up, buddy.
And it's a guy.

330
00:14:11,818 --> 00:14:13,117
I don't do this shit.

331
00:14:13,119 --> 00:14:15,420
Short and sweet, just like
your mother likes it.

332
00:14:15,422 --> 00:14:17,355
<i>That's great, you're talkin'</i>
<i>about my mom again.</i>

333
00:14:17,357 --> 00:14:19,991
What, man, she has soft hands.

334
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:22,493
<i>Uh, that's really weird.</i>

335
00:14:22,495 --> 00:14:23,862
Why is that weird?

336
00:14:23,864 --> 00:14:25,363
It's not like I'm saying it
sexually, okay?

337
00:14:25,365 --> 00:14:26,998
I just mean,
her hands feel like

338
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,633
they're dipped in shea butter
or something.

339
00:14:28,635 --> 00:14:29,901
It's actually quite amazing.

340
00:14:29,903 --> 00:14:31,336
<i>Well, how would you feel</i>
<i>if I showed her</i>

341
00:14:31,338 --> 00:14:32,971
<i>this fuckin' tape?</i>

342
00:14:32,973 --> 00:14:36,808
I would say, "Mrs. Cohen, you
have silky, soft, smooth hands.

343
00:14:36,810 --> 00:14:37,976
And I love you."

344
00:14:37,978 --> 00:14:39,477
<i>Okay.</i>
<i>Let's get outta here.</i>

345
00:14:39,479 --> 00:14:41,279
<i>I'm not fuckin'--</i>

346
00:14:41,281 --> 00:14:42,747
<i>Ready?</i>

This is perfect,
this makes sense.

357
00:15:11,711 --> 00:15:13,511
Yeah, okay, turn the camera off.
It's evolution.

I'm being serious
right now.

Cameron, come on,
this shit's not cool.

360
00:15:15,582 --> 00:15:16,614
No, I'm being seriou--

361
00:15:16,616 --> 00:15:18,416
Let my talk to you
for a min-- oh!

362
00:15:18,418 --> 00:15:19,784
Uh!

I tell you everything.

Not only do you tell everybody,

00:15:50,650 --> 00:15:52,383
hey, but now I'm gonna tell it
in front of Capri

378
00:15:52,385 --> 00:15:53,484
and on camera.

You guys are a--

381
00:15:58,658 --> 00:16:01,659
So, there, no, it's not.
What the fuck is going on?

382
00:16:01,661 --> 00:16:02,827
It's none of your business
either.

383
00:16:02,829 --> 00:16:03,995
No, it is my business

384
00:16:03,997 --> 00:16:06,164
because both of you
are my friend

385
00:16:06,166 --> 00:16:08,866
and I think both of you
make a perfect couple.

386
00:16:08,868 --> 00:16:10,435
And I don't know what
the fuck you're doing.

387
00:16:10,437 --> 00:16:12,236
I mean, I don't know
what you're doing with that guy.

388
00:16:12,238 --> 00:16:13,571
You've known him
your whole life.

389
00:16:13,573 --> 00:16:17,175
I don't understand what is
stopping you from committing.

390
00:16:17,177 --> 00:16:18,543
Why would we want to ruin that?

391
00:16:18,545 --> 00:16:20,545
Our friendship,
our relationship.

00:16:26,686 --> 00:16:27,986
<i>Yeah, there's no fucking trust</i>

395
00:16:27,988 --> 00:16:29,687
<i>'cause you didn't trust me</i>
<i>enough to tell me.</i>

396
00:16:29,689 --> 00:16:31,589
I think that it's not fair--

397
00:16:31,591 --> 00:16:32,590
<i>You can't tell me?</i>

398
00:16:32,592 --> 00:16:33,825

399
00:16:33,827 --> 00:16:35,493
<i>So what's the big deal</i>
<i>if Tommy Kay knows?</i>

400
00:16:35,495 --> 00:16:37,261
Let's hear what Tommy Kay
has to say.

401
00:16:37,263 --> 00:16:40,465
I think it's not fair that
you're keeping Luke on hold.

402
00:16:40,467 --> 00:16:43,568
And I think it's not fair that
you are still single, my friend.

403
00:16:43,570 --> 00:16:44,936
I got side girls.

404
00:16:44,938 --> 00:16:47,405
And that is just--
that's just--

405
00:16:47,407 --> 00:16:51,075
Why am I keeping him on hold?

406
00:16:51,077 --> 00:16:53,411
I mean, a friendship
isn't good enough?

407
00:16:53,413 --> 00:16:55,380
I think your boyfriend
should be your best friend.

408
00:16:57,116 --> 00:17:00,785
But why can't I have my best
friend and my boyfriend?

409
00:17:00,787 --> 00:17:03,121
And have him always here,
always--

410
00:17:03,123 --> 00:17:04,722
Wow, always here.
No, I don't mean like that.

413
00:17:08,962 --> 00:17:10,828
<i>What do you think</i>
<i>about Luke's side girls?</i>

414
00:17:12,398 --> 00:17:13,998
<i>Oh, yeah.</i>

415
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,400
Well, that shouldn't affect you

416
00:17:15,402 --> 00:17:17,301
because he should be able
to fuck

417
00:17:17,303 --> 00:17:19,070
as many girls as he wants

418
00:17:19,072 --> 00:17:22,073
'cause you guys are not
in a committed relationship.

419
00:17:22,075 --> 00:17:24,108
I'm going on a fucking spree
tonight.

00:17:24,110 --> 00:17:27,211
<i>Fuck, yes, amen!</i>

421
00:17:27,213 --> 00:17:29,580
Okay, well I thought you guys
were doing me a favor

422
00:17:29,582 --> 00:17:30,581
and I didn't know
you were going to give me

423
00:17:30,583 --> 00:17:31,849
such a hassle about it

424
00:17:31,851 --> 00:17:33,584
and make things awkward.

425
00:17:33,586 --> 00:17:35,153
While everything's awkward,

426
00:17:35,155 --> 00:17:36,387
I'm gonna tell you
about this thing.

00:17:36,389 --> 00:17:38,089

428
00:17:38,091 --> 00:17:40,591

doing the dirty,

429
00:17:40,593 --> 00:17:42,827

"Hey, I want you to F me
in my little P."

433
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:02,647

"What the fuck?"

You're such assholes!

You're such an asshole.

Let go!

00:18:14,194 --> 00:18:16,360
<i>Did she actually say D and P?</i>

Just a minute, it's okay.

That was my burrito.

521
00:21:14,841 --> 00:21:16,040
<i>I just don't know, Luke.</i>

522
00:21:16,042 --> 00:21:17,742
<i>Don't put so much</i>

523
00:21:17,744 --> 00:21:19,176

Let's go.

538

00:21:48,041 --> 00:21:50,675
tell her that you are
not a girl.

541
00:21:50,677 --> 00:21:52,743

00:22:11,764 --> 00:22:13,964
We're gonna be there
in ten minutes.

550
00:22:13,966 --> 00:22:15,900
Where are you gonna pull off?
There's no exits.

551
00:22:15,902 --> 00:22:17,068
What do you want me to do?

552
00:22:17,070 --> 00:22:18,803
I want you to hold it,
like a man.

553
00:22:18,805 --> 00:22:20,738
Do you have like, a fucking box
or something?

554
00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:22,740
A box?

555
00:22:22,742 --> 00:22:24,041
[yells]

556
00:22:24,043 --> 00:22:26,043
He's gonna shit in a box.

557
00:22:26,045 --> 00:22:27,645
Let's make him shit in a box.

558
00:22:27,647 --> 00:22:28,913
Hold the wheel for a sec.
No.

559
00:22:28,915 --> 00:22:30,214
Hold the fucking wheel!

00:22:32,752 --> 00:22:34,752
<i>Graham.</i>
<i>No.</i>

563
00:22:34,754 --> 00:22:36,754
<i>If you do this,</i>

<i>Oh, my God.</i>

564
00:22:36,756 --> 00:22:38,823
Okay, okay.
Ohh!

565
00:22:38,825 --> 00:22:39,857
What, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

566
00:22:39,859 --> 00:22:43,127
[coughing]

567
00:22:43,129 --> 00:22:44,695
I'm over the hump,
I'm over the hump.

568
00:22:44,697 --> 00:22:46,697
<i>[Capri] What's wrong with you?</i>
<i>What did you eat today?</i>

569
00:22:46,699 --> 00:22:50,768
Oh, my God, ahh!

570
00:22:50,770 --> 00:22:52,069
All right, seriously,

571
00:22:52,071 --> 00:22:53,838
this is the kind
of fine establishment

572
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:55,539

575
00:22:58,778 --> 00:23:01,178
And Graham's been in here
for like, 30 minutes.

576
00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:02,546
We're gonna go check on him.

Las Vegas, the strip, sin city.

608
00:24:41,714 --> 00:24:43,848
We're gonna find out
why it's called sin city.

609
00:24:43,850 --> 00:24:47,384
[falsetto] We're here,
we have arrived, we've come.

610
00:24:47,386 --> 00:24:49,753
Still get's a little wild
because of Graham's stoner ass.

611
00:24:49,755 --> 00:24:52,223
Ohh, check out that chick
over there.

612
00:24:52,225 --> 00:24:54,358
Graham, get her number, dude.

Start your engines.

615
00:24:58,865 --> 00:25:00,664
The crew is in the house.

616
00:25:00,666 --> 00:25:02,533
[engine noise]

617
00:25:02,535 --> 00:25:04,101
That was
the engine starting.

618
00:25:04,103 --> 00:25:06,036
That is Graham's engine
starting.

619
00:25:06,038 --> 00:25:09,240
Hey, check this place out
for a second.

620
00:25:09,242 --> 00:25:10,508
Yo, yo, yo, yo.

621
00:25:10,510 --> 00:25:14,044
Hey, special thanks
to my father, Dr. Townes,

622
00:25:14,046 --> 00:25:16,881
for hooking us up
with the most bomb-ass suite

623
00:25:16,883 --> 00:25:18,649
that this town has to offer.

624
00:25:18,651 --> 00:25:20,484
All right, hey,

625
00:25:20,486 --> 00:25:21,552
<i>Film me.</i>

626
00:25:23,688 --> 00:25:25,122
I don't know
where the room is.

627
00:25:26,758 --> 00:25:28,025
I'm out of breath already.

I can't breath anymore.
I can't breath anymore.

629

00:25:35,935 --> 00:25:37,167
You're such a pussy.

00:25:37,169 --> 00:25:38,636
<i>[Capri] What floor are we on?</i>

633
00:25:38,638 --> 00:25:39,637
Okay.

634
00:25:39,639 --> 00:25:40,838
<i>And we go-- the hallway</i>

635
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:41,839
<i>that's gonna lead us</i>

636
00:25:41,841 --> 00:25:43,807
<i>to the scene of the crime.</i>

637
00:25:43,809 --> 00:25:45,576
<i>Where did you get that?</i>

638
00:25:45,578 --> 00:25:47,144
<i>This is my documentary.</i>

639
00:25:47,146 --> 00:25:48,679
<i>Actually feels pretty good.</i>

640
00:25:48,681 --> 00:25:51,749
Okay, so tell me, what's the--
oh, shi-- oh, my God.

641
00:25:51,751 --> 00:25:53,317
Oh, Graham.

642
00:25:53,319 --> 00:25:54,351
<i>Graham, what the fuck?</i>

643
00:25:54,353 --> 00:25:55,819
Graham cracker.

644
00:25:55,821 --> 00:25:57,021
<i>Dude, I missed it,</i>
<i>you gotta do it again.</i>

645
00:25:57,023 --> 00:25:58,188
Nothing happened.

00:25:58,190 --> 00:25:59,723
<i>Do it for the documentary,</i>
<i>come on.</i>

647
00:25:59,725 --> 00:26:03,294
Are you jealous, because I just
got the most amazing footage.

648
00:26:03,296 --> 00:26:04,962
<i>No, and actually</i>
<i>I have a good idea</i>

649
00:26:04,964 --> 00:26:08,599
<i>because now we can get</i>
<i>some tag team double footage.</i>

650
00:26:08,601 --> 00:26:10,634
<i>Two different angles.</i>
<i>Two different angles.</i>

651
00:26:10,636 --> 00:26:11,802
Dude.
Fuck.

652
00:26:11,804 --> 00:26:13,404
<i>But I'm gonna need</i>

00:26:13,406 --> 00:26:16,140
<i>You all right, buddy?</i>

654
00:26:16,142 --> 00:26:17,741
<i>Hey, you think you can</i>
<i>do it again?</i>

655
00:26:17,743 --> 00:26:18,742
I think I ruptured my coccyx.

656
00:26:18,744 --> 00:26:20,010
<i>Think you can do it again?</i>

657
00:26:23,148 --> 00:26:25,182

You kidding me?

661
00:26:31,557 --> 00:26:34,425
This is what I'm talking
about, Cameron.

662
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:37,027
Who wants some shots?

663
00:26:37,029 --> 00:26:38,395
Watch it.

664
00:26:39,497 --> 00:26:41,865
Seriously, thank you, Daddy.

665
00:26:41,867 --> 00:26:44,101
Wait a second, where's Graham?

666
00:26:44,103 --> 00:26:45,302
Graham?

667
00:26:45,304 --> 00:26:47,037
Graham?
<i>Where the heck is Graham at?</i>

668
00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:48,439
Graham?

669
00:26:48,441 --> 00:26:49,907
Hey, where'd Graham go?

670
00:26:49,909 --> 00:26:52,076
Graham?

<i>Where's little Graham crackers?</i>

671

00:26:54,780 --> 00:26:56,380
<i>Dude, you're scaring the kids.</i>

689
00:27:36,856 --> 00:27:38,822
[all] Bitchin!

690
00:27:38,824 --> 00:27:41,291
That's the greatest
cheers ever.

691
00:27:45,063 --> 00:27:47,297
Documented, look,
did you see these?

692
00:27:47,299 --> 00:27:48,432
History is in the making.

693
00:27:49,601 --> 00:27:50,634
Ready, ready?

694
00:27:50,636 --> 00:27:52,136
Get a close up on this, Cam.

695
00:27:59,678 --> 00:28:01,412
One more, for good luck.

696
00:28:01,414 --> 00:28:02,846
You-- one more for good luck.

697
00:28:02,848 --> 00:28:05,115
If you don't do it,
your whole family could die.

698
00:28:05,117 --> 00:28:06,817
Dead, forever.

699
00:28:06,819 --> 00:28:08,686
Come on, don't kill your mom.

700
00:28:08,688 --> 00:28:09,820
Don't kill your mom.

701
00:28:09,822 --> 00:28:11,355
Fuck it!
Don't kill your mom.

702

Yeah, man!

705
00:28:16,729 --> 00:28:19,163
Oh, gross.

706
00:28:19,165 --> 00:28:22,166
My mouth is on fire.

707
00:28:23,201 --> 00:28:24,368
It's on fire.

709
00:28:25,705 --> 00:28:27,504
I'm not doin' it, I'm not--

710
00:28:34,579 --> 00:28:36,513
Hey.

711
00:28:36,515 --> 00:28:38,816
I'm pooping while I play
<i>Brick Breaker.</i>

712
00:28:38,818 --> 00:28:39,950
So, a lot tonight, Bro.

713
00:28:39,952 --> 00:28:41,018
Yeah.

714
00:28:41,953 --> 00:28:44,054
Before we go out,

715
00:28:44,056 --> 00:28:45,989
I wanna do a couple jokes
with you, okay?

716
00:28:45,991 --> 00:28:48,192
Just get your confidence
a little bit higher.

717
00:28:48,194 --> 00:28:50,794
[groans]

718
00:28:50,796 --> 00:28:51,962
Hear what I said?

719
00:28:51,964 --> 00:28:53,430
Yeah.

720
00:28:53,432 --> 00:28:55,599
You gotta trust me, man.

721
00:28:55,601 --> 00:28:57,501
Can you leave?
I gotta wipe.

722
00:28:57,503 --> 00:28:59,269
It's okay.

723
00:28:59,271 --> 00:29:01,605
Part a life.
I gotta wipe.

724
00:29:01,607 --> 00:29:03,707
Would you get the fuck out,
I gotta wipe!

725
00:29:06,411 --> 00:29:08,512
First tip-- white teeth.

726
00:29:08,514 --> 00:29:10,080
They love white teeth.

727
00:29:10,082 --> 00:29:11,982
Second tip--
[whispers] Cameron,

728
00:29:11,984 --> 00:29:13,183
Oh, my God, it smells in here.

729
00:29:13,185 --> 00:29:14,752
Cameron,

730
00:29:17,422 --> 00:29:18,956

a handsome motherchucker.

I didn't mean to fight.

Graham, you play too much, man.
I did.

You were going to give 'em

00:31:29,088 --> 00:31:31,255
Stop, stop.

Sleeper hold.

00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:36,793
<i>Hey, no more fighting,</i>
<i>let's go get drunk.</i>

795
00:31:38,630 --> 00:31:41,732
We're here on a mission
to find the rare creature

796
00:31:41,734 --> 00:31:43,967
they call the Grahaminator.

797
00:31:43,969 --> 00:31:46,904
He's a-- he's a rare,
rare, spectacle.

798
00:31:46,906 --> 00:31:49,273
He's been know to wander
this jungle aimlessly

799
00:31:49,275 --> 00:31:52,609
looking for muff to burrow into
for hours and days at a time.

800
00:31:52,611 --> 00:31:54,044
Some say he eats kids.

801
00:31:54,046 --> 00:31:55,445
Some say he eats adults.

802
00:31:55,447 --> 00:31:57,281
Some say he lives off nothing.

803
00:31:57,283 --> 00:32:01,184
Some say he's the hardest thing
to spot in this--

804
00:32:06,124 --> 00:32:07,824
<i>Hey, Graham.</i>
<i>What?</i>

805

<i>You want another card?</i>
<i>No.</i>

00:32:22,407 --> 00:32:25,709
All right, sorry,

Cameron, I love you.
<i>How are you winning?</i>

813
00:32:35,821 --> 00:32:37,888
I'm playing blackjack.

814
00:32:37,890 --> 00:32:39,589
<i>Hey, pussy.</i>

815
00:32:39,591 --> 00:32:41,892
<i>About that chick at the pool.</i>

816
00:32:41,894 --> 00:32:43,427
Oh, I know.

817
00:32:43,429 --> 00:32:45,495
You know how you guys
said she was a hooker?

818
00:32:45,497 --> 00:32:47,297
<i>Yeah.</i>
<i>She mighta been.</i>

819
00:32:47,299 --> 00:32:48,966
<i>I knew she was.</i>

820
00:32:48,968 --> 00:32:51,835
<i>Hey, I'm sorry</i>
<i>about that, okay?</i>
<i>Sh-hhh, don't.</i>

821
00:32:53,738 --> 00:32:55,105
Come play with me.

00:32:55,107 --> 00:32:57,074
<i>Happy birthday.</i>
<i>Come play with me.</i>

<i>I'm coming, let's go.</i>

824
00:32:58,143 --> 00:32:59,543
I want you to play ball.

825
00:32:59,545 --> 00:33:01,578
<i>Let's go.</i>
<i>Come on.</i>

826
00:33:01,580 --> 00:33:03,347
Come on.

827
00:33:05,049 --> 00:33:08,352
I wanna-- I wanna go--
remember that--

828
00:33:08,354 --> 00:33:09,920
Let's go talk to that hooker.

829
00:33:09,922 --> 00:33:12,823
<i>Let's go find her.</i>
<i>Because I have money now.</i>

830
00:33:12,825 --> 00:33:15,392
<i>Let's release teddy bear back</i>
<i>into the wilderness.</i>

831
00:33:15,394 --> 00:33:17,094
I have money.

832
00:33:18,296 --> 00:33:20,263
I have-- wait, wait--

833
00:33:20,265 --> 00:33:22,065
Do I look good
sitting backwards?

834
00:33:22,067 --> 00:33:24,067
Do I look cool?
<i>Look so hot.</i>

835
00:33:24,069 --> 00:33:25,602
All right, let's go.

836
00:33:26,537 --> 00:33:27,804
<i>Hey, guys, listen.</i>

837
00:33:27,806 --> 00:33:29,639
She was fine.
I got a solution.

838
00:33:29,641 --> 00:33:31,475
No, what?
I got something else to do.

839
00:33:31,477 --> 00:33:32,709
<i>What?</i>

840
00:33:32,711 --> 00:33:34,144
<i>It's sure thing.</i>

841
00:33:34,146 --> 00:33:36,213
<i>Read it.</i>

842
00:33:36,215 --> 00:33:38,582
Yo, this girl just texted me,
she has two bottles of--

843
00:33:38,584 --> 00:33:40,283
Paradise, this is--
<i>Two bottles and a friend.</i>

844
00:33:40,285 --> 00:33:41,918
<i>You can do that</i>
<i>any time back home.</i>

845
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:43,453
<i>We're in Vegas in a suite.</i>
<i>We're willing to do anything</i>

846
00:33:43,455 --> 00:33:45,722
to make you happy.
Read it again.

847
00:33:45,724 --> 00:33:47,524
I just-- why do I have
to read it twice for you?

848
00:33:47,526 --> 00:33:48,525
<i>Read it again.</i>
<i>You heard it.</i>

849
00:33:48,527 --> 00:33:51,862
<i>Read it again.</i>
<i>7-0-2-GET-2-WET.</i>

850
00:33:51,864 --> 00:33:55,866
It's a water park.
Luke, you are a articulate,
intelligent, good looking

851
00:33:55,868 --> 00:33:59,970
individual that is gonna
go pay-- and back to me.
Hey, Tommy Kay.

852
00:33:59,972 --> 00:34:02,105
That is going to go pay
for pussy.

853
00:34:02,107 --> 00:34:05,075
One night, this one night!
Explain this logic to me.

854
00:34:05,077 --> 00:34:07,077
And you Cameron,
I forgot about you

855
00:34:07,079 --> 00:34:08,512
'cause you're a really
ugly looking dude

856
00:34:08,514 --> 00:34:10,347
so you have to go
pay for pussy.

857
00:34:10,349 --> 00:34:14,251
That makes sense.
I agree with him for--

858
00:34:14,253 --> 00:34:15,786
<i>What's the difference</i>
<i>for one night?</i>

859
00:34:15,788 --> 00:34:17,821
<i>We're in Vegas, don't you want</i>
<i>to do something crazy?</i>

860
00:34:17,823 --> 00:34:19,656
<i>Do you always play it safe?</i>

00:34:19,658 --> 00:34:21,425
No, we won't play it safe.

Let's go to the club
and get herpes.

863
00:34:23,862 --> 00:34:25,095
But I'm not paying for pussy

864
00:34:25,097 --> 00:34:27,130
and I'm not going
to a strip club

865
00:34:27,132 --> 00:34:28,432
because I got
a bad feeling about it.

866

<i>Hey, if worse comes to worse,</i>

867
00:34:30,135 --> 00:34:31,935

Let's just go check

Why are you trippin', man.

<i>Come on, one night.</i>

877
00:34:49,755 --> 00:34:51,455
<i>What is one night?</i>
<i>We're in Vegas!</i>

878
00:34:51,457 --> 00:34:53,390
<i>It's your brother's birthday.</i>

879
00:34:53,392 --> 00:34:54,724
<i>Just call the number.</i>

880
00:34:54,726 --> 00:34:56,259
That's true.
Call the number.

881
00:34:56,261 --> 00:34:58,929
Fuck it, give it here.

882
00:34:58,931 --> 00:35:00,697
<i>See, let's call it.</i>

883
00:35:02,366 --> 00:35:03,834
Tommy Kay, you won't regret it.

00:35:03,836 --> 00:35:06,169
We'll just go for an hour.
Let's just go.

885
00:35:06,171 --> 00:35:08,572
Are we going?

886
00:35:08,574 --> 00:35:10,874
<i>Hey, you're not</i>
<i>gonna regret it, buddy.</i>

You're not gonna regret it.
All right.

[whispering] Oh, my gosh,
there's so much alcohol
in that drink.

894
00:35:27,092 --> 00:35:28,792
I put a lot of tequila in it.
I believe it.

Oh, Candice, nice name.

00:35:42,841 --> 00:35:44,908
Um, what's goin' on, Candice?

904
00:35:44,910 --> 00:35:47,010
We're trying to get
some strippers over here.

905
00:35:48,479 --> 00:35:51,548
<i>Why don't you come here?</i>

906

Come to you?

00:35:53,352 --> 00:35:54,518
<i>Yes.</i>

<i>Dude, that's how it works.</i>

<i>Where are you guys located?</i>

912
00:36:03,227 --> 00:36:05,328
<i>We are very close</i>
<i>to the strip.</i>

<i>I'm getting paper,</i>
<i>I gotta get some paper.</i>

<i>[Luke] Hold on one second,</i>
<i>I gotta write this down.</i>

<i>Okay, coming from the strip,</i>

919
00:36:20,379 --> 00:36:25,415
<i>take the 515</i>
<i>to the next light.</i>
<i>Okay.</i>

920
00:36:25,417 --> 00:36:28,818
They better have like,
16 girls, at least.

<i>Hey, Cameron, you excited</i>
<i>about it now?</i>

Yeah, I'm cool,
yeah, let's do it.

<i>Jesus, come on.</i>
<i>Come on, dude, let's do it.</i>

925
00:36:40,065 --> 00:36:42,098
<i>We're gonna get you a woman.</i>

<i>Let's do it.</i>
<i>Whatever, let's go.</i>

00:36:55,781 --> 00:37:00,283
Okay, for the record, I am
very we-- very, very, I am--

00:37:00,285 --> 00:37:02,586
<i>Stop taking-- I told you</i>
<i>to stop taking shots.</i>

935
00:37:02,588 --> 00:37:04,788
For the record-- why?

936
00:37:04,790 --> 00:37:06,556
I am aware of the fact
that this a--

937
00:37:06,558 --> 00:37:08,925
might be my worse decision ever.

938
00:37:08,927 --> 00:37:12,329
And I come from a long line
of bad decisions.

939
00:37:12,331 --> 00:37:15,298
But on the other, hey--
on the other hand,

940
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:18,368
this might be the brightest,
shiniest moment of my life.

941
00:37:18,370 --> 00:37:21,338
Not at all-- it's probably
the worst idea ever.

<i>are you happy?</i>

00:37:26,278 --> 00:37:28,378
<i>I'm excited.</i>

Oh, shit, I don't think we've
ever done that once.

960
00:37:58,043 --> 00:37:59,643
We've never done that right yet.

You guys know what?
What?

962
00:38:01,246 --> 00:38:03,813
You know, there's really
only two things

963
00:38:03,815 --> 00:38:04,814
that I'm really good at.

964
00:38:04,816 --> 00:38:06,716
You know?
You know what they are, right?

965
00:38:06,718 --> 00:38:10,587
One is making-- one is making
really bad decisions,

966
00:38:10,589 --> 00:38:13,023
which are almost so bad,
they're awesome.

967
00:38:13,025 --> 00:38:14,791
Like now.

968
00:38:14,793 --> 00:38:16,793
And the other one
is thumb wrestling.

969
00:38:17,962 --> 00:38:21,965
So, I'm gonna pay some hooker
and extra ten bucks

970
00:38:21,967 --> 00:38:23,633
to thumb wrestle me,
and I'll be two for two

00:38:23,635 --> 00:38:25,535
at everything I do wonderful.

972
00:38:25,537 --> 00:38:27,337
What's next, where we goin'?

973
00:38:27,339 --> 00:38:28,638
Huh?

974
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:30,807
Uh, what do you mean,
where are we going?

975
00:38:30,809 --> 00:38:32,475
We're goin' to the whore house.

Paradise.

977
00:38:34,212 --> 00:38:37,247
Cam, focus.
Yeah, hey, I'm lookin'.

978
00:38:37,249 --> 00:38:39,716
Um,
Give me the directions, bro.

979
00:38:39,718 --> 00:38:41,951
Yeah, I don't have that--
I don't have that paper.

980
00:38:41,953 --> 00:38:43,119
What?
What?

981
00:38:43,121 --> 00:38:45,555
I know, I said I had it.
And I don't.

982
00:38:45,557 --> 00:38:47,924
You douche.

983
00:38:47,926 --> 00:38:50,560
It wasn't that-- hey, it wasn't
that many directions.

984
00:38:50,562 --> 00:38:52,095
We're gonna find it, all right?

985
00:38:52,097 --> 00:38:53,229
It's cool.

986
00:38:53,231 --> 00:38:55,999
Chill out, dude,
chill out okay?

987
00:38:56,001 --> 00:38:57,334
I'm chill,
I just don't know why--

988
00:38:57,336 --> 00:38:59,703
Dude, look, hey, there's
the truck stop, right there.

989
00:38:59,705 --> 00:39:00,837
Where?
It's right there.

990
00:39:00,839 --> 00:39:02,105
We turn right there,
that's what they said.

991
00:39:02,107 --> 00:39:03,139
There's a truck stop.
Turn the camera off.

992
00:39:03,141 --> 00:39:04,808
That's the truck stop,
let's go.

993
00:39:04,810 --> 00:39:05,942
Turn the camera off, please.
Look, we're there.

994
00:39:05,944 --> 00:39:07,544
We made it.
We have arrived.

995
00:39:07,546 --> 00:39:10,580
Is that a cop behind us?
Is that a cop behind us?

996
00:39:19,890 --> 00:39:21,324
Still okay.

997
00:39:21,326 --> 00:39:26,329
This officially might be
the sketchiest place on Earth.

00:39:31,669 --> 00:39:35,071
<i>Shit, check this place out.</i>

999
00:39:35,073 --> 00:39:36,606
Might be offi-- yeah.

1000
00:39:36,608 --> 00:39:38,208
My worst idea ever.

00:39:38,210 --> 00:39:40,243
Okay, Cam, you're now
Captain Obvious.

00:39:40,245 --> 00:39:42,045
What are you guys waiting for?

1003

Who is that?

<i>On the count of three--</i>
<i>one, two, three.</i>

Who is that?

is a dumb motherfucker.

1203
00:59:26,864 --> 00:59:28,363

<i>one time at your grandma's</i>

Ahhh!

1222
01:00:15,378 --> 01:00:17,112

1223
01:00:17,114 --> 01:00:18,380
Woof!

1224
01:00:25,622 --> 01:00:26,955
All right, all right.

1225
01:00:32,862 --> 01:00:35,797
Yeah, I'm kind of in the middle

1226
01:00:35,799 --> 01:00:37,065

Please.

1228
01:00:39,603 --> 01:00:41,169

1230
01:00:42,239 --> 01:00:43,672

1232
01:00:49,178 --> 01:00:51,446
So, so much for our weekend
together in Vegas.

1233
01:00:53,916 --> 01:00:55,917
<i>So, Salter, did it ever</i>
<i>get lonely</i>

1234
01:00:55,919 --> 01:00:57,853
<i>out there</i>
<i>on the battlefield?</i>

1235
01:00:57,855 --> 01:01:00,689
I mean, it wasn't so bad--
there were girls.

1236
01:01:00,691 --> 01:01:02,224
<i>Jake said there were no girls.</i>

1237
01:01:02,226 --> 01:01:03,692
I mean, there weren't any
in the corps, you know,

1238
01:01:03,694 --> 01:01:05,727
but there were-- locals.

1239
01:01:05,729 --> 01:01:07,629
If you're willing to pay.

1240
01:01:07,631 --> 01:01:09,531
<i>And I'm sure you were, right?</i>

1241
01:01:11,300 --> 01:01:14,536
Six months is a long time
without the touch of a woman.

1242
01:01:14,538 --> 01:01:16,204
So, yeah.

1243
01:01:16,206 --> 01:01:18,206
<i>Did Jake ever get</i>
<i>that desperate?</i>

1244
01:01:21,277 --> 01:01:22,944
How the hell
am I supposed to know?

1245
01:01:22,946 --> 01:01:24,513
I wasn't watching him every
minute, you know?

1246
01:01:25,848 --> 01:01:28,183
What the fuck, man?
What up, bro?

1247
01:01:28,185 --> 01:01:29,451
Who's buyin' the next drinks?

1248
01:01:29,453 --> 01:01:31,687
I'll do it, I'll do it.

1249
01:01:31,689 --> 01:01:34,690
<i>Jake, did you ever pay</i>
<i>for a hooker?</i>
<i>What?</i>

1250
01:01:34,692 --> 01:01:35,891

<i>Did you pay for a hooker?</i>

1254
01:01:40,531 --> 01:01:41,930

<i>Yeah, I have no idea</i>

1256
01:01:43,634 --> 01:01:45,600
She's asking questions about
hookers and stuff like that.

1257
01:01:45,602 --> 01:01:47,936
I have no idea.
Did you ever pay for a hooker?

1258

It's crazy.

1259

What's goin' on?

1260
01:01:51,275 --> 01:01:53,709
Dude, hey, can you please just
get that shit out of my face?

1261
01:01:53,711 --> 01:01:54,876

1263
01:02:15,832 --> 01:02:18,033

1265
01:02:19,470 --> 01:02:21,870
You listen to one of my

1266
01:02:21,872 --> 01:02:25,807
And so I'm automatically accused
of fucking a prostitute?

1267

1374
01:13:51,261 --> 01:13:52,326
[growls]

1375
01:14:27,663 --> 01:14:30,131
Help, please, please.

1376
01:14:35,037 --> 01:14:36,103
We're almost out.

1377
01:15:07,636 --> 01:15:09,670
<i>[Luke] No, Capri!</i>

1378
01:15:11,073 --> 01:15:12,673
<i>Fucking!</i>

1379
01:15:12,675 --> 01:15:14,642
<i>I'm gonna kill you!</i>

1380
01:15:16,144 --> 01:15:17,311
<i>[yelling]</i>

1381
01:15:45,207 --> 01:15:46,841
<i>My friend,</i>

1382
01:15:46,843 --> 01:15:50,111
<i>you have seen this incident</i>
<i>based on sworn testimony.</i>

1383
01:15:50,113 --> 01:15:53,414
<i>Can you prove that it</i>
<i>didn't happen?</i>

1384
01:15:53,416 --> 01:15:55,383
<i>Perhaps on your way home,</i>

1385
01:15:55,385 --> 01:15:57,818
<i>someone will pass you</i>
<i>in the dark.</i>

1386
01:15:57,820 --> 01:15:59,954
<i>And you will never know it!</i>

1387
01:15:59,956 --> 01:16:03,224
<i>For they will be</i>
<i>from outer space.</i>

1388
01:16:03,226 --> 01:16:05,426
<i>Many scientists believe</i>
<i>that another world</i>

1389
01:16:05,428 --> 01:16:07,895
<i>is watching us this moment.</i>

1390
01:16:07,897 --> 01:16:10,698
<i>We once laughed</i>
<i>at the horseless carriage,</i>

1391
01:16:10,700 --> 01:16:13,267
<i>the airplane, the telephone,</i>

1392
01:16:13,269 --> 01:16:14,669
<i>the electric light,</i>

1393
01:16:14,671 --> 01:16:18,406
<i>vitamins, radio,</i>
<i>and even television.</i>

1394
01:16:18,408 --> 01:16:21,309
<i>And now some of us laugh</i>
<i>at outer space.</i>

1395
01:16:26,348 --> 01:16:29,650
<i>God help us in the future.</i>

1396
01:17:45,961 --> 01:17:49,363
<i>Only moments ago, after five</i>
<i>long weeks of searching,</i>

1397
01:17:49,365 --> 01:17:52,233
<i>Capri Johnson was discovered</i>
<i>just a few feet from here</i>

1398
01:17:52,235 --> 01:17:55,136
<i>on this deserted road,</i>
<i>just outside of Reno, Nevada.</i>

1399
01:17:55,138 --> 01:17:56,604
<i>Thanks to an anonymous tip,</i>

1400
01:17:56,606 --> 01:17:58,472
<i>Channel 11 was first</i>
<i>on the scene.</i>

1401
01:17:58,474 --> 01:18:00,708
<i>I must warn you, the footage</i>
<i>you are about to see</i>

1402
01:18:00,710 --> 01:18:02,543
<i>is extremely disturbing.</i>

1403
01:18:02,545 --> 01:18:04,812
<i>Sensitive viewers</i>
<i>may not want to watch.</i>

1404
01:18:10,819 --> 01:18:12,920
<i>[crying]</i>
