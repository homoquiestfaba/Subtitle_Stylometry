373
00:13:00,121 --> 00:13:01,610
I need to focus for tomorrow.

374
00:13:01,611 --> 00:13:02,362
I'm sorry.

375
00:13:02,363 --> 00:13:04,804
What?

376
00:13:04,805 --> 00:13:06,926
Rain check?

377
00:13:06,927 --> 00:13:08,327
Rain check?

378
00:13:08,328 --> 00:13:09,658
Come on, cheerleader.

379
00:13:09,659 --> 00:13:11,520
I'm cheering.

380
00:13:11,521 --> 00:13:13,372
I'm cheering.

381
00:13:13,373 --> 00:13:14,194
I love you.

382
00:13:14,194 --> 00:13:15,194
I love you, too.

383
00:13:22,262 --> 00:13:23,262
Damn.

384
00:13:29,669 --> 00:13:32,631
Woo.

385
00:13:32,632 --> 00:13:34,603
Great shot, sir.

386
00:13:34,604 --> 00:13:35,345
Thank you.

387
00:13:35,346 --> 00:13:36,346
Good to see you, Mr. Godfrey.

388
00:13:36,346 --> 00:13:36,937
Good to see you.

389
00:13:36,937 --> 00:13:37,858
This here's for you.

390
00:13:37,858 --> 00:13:38,858
What is this?

391
00:13:44,164 --> 00:13:46,055
Come on.

392
00:13:46,056 --> 00:13:46,887
I already know your work.

393
00:13:46,888 --> 00:13:48,277
I don't need to see that.

394
00:13:48,278 --> 00:13:50,900
I know you're brilliant.

395
00:13:50,901 --> 00:13:52,771
Thank you, sir.

396
00:13:52,772 --> 00:13:56,685
But to be the
director of marketing

397
00:13:56,686 --> 00:13:58,477
requires more than brilliance.

398
00:13:58,478 --> 00:14:01,210
Yes, it takes someone who
is completely organized,

399
00:14:01,211 --> 00:14:03,812
highly knowledgeable,
and in complete control.

400
00:14:03,813 --> 00:14:06,305
And someone who's willing to
listen just as much as they're

401
00:14:06,306 --> 00:14:11,961
willing to talk,
someone who's flexible.

402
00:14:11,962 --> 00:14:14,513
(WHISPERS) Yes.

403
00:14:14,514 --> 00:14:17,676
Someone who has a
willingness to learn,

404
00:14:17,677 --> 00:14:21,630
and someone who's
open for suggestions.

405
00:14:21,631 --> 00:14:22,552
Am I right?

406
00:14:22,552 --> 00:14:23,473
Yes, sir.

407
00:14:23,473 --> 00:14:24,274
Definitely.

408
00:14:24,275 --> 00:14:25,975
Listen, Brooke. k What
we're trying to do this year

409
00:14:25,976 --> 00:14:28,157
is tap into the young market.

410
00:14:28,158 --> 00:14:28,868
Oh.

411
00:14:28,869 --> 00:14:31,140
So we need someone who
resonates with these younger

412
00:14:31,141 --> 00:14:35,004
clients we're trying to
bring in, someone who, uh,

413
00:14:35,005 --> 00:14:38,347
thinks outside of the box.

414
00:14:38,348 --> 00:14:41,380
Well, I, sir, can definitely
think outside of the box.

415
00:14:41,381 --> 00:14:42,391
I assure you that.

416
00:14:42,392 --> 00:14:43,852
You can?

417
00:14:43,853 --> 00:14:44,544
Yes, sir.

418
00:14:44,544 --> 00:14:45,544
Well, let's just see.

419
00:14:51,701 --> 00:14:56,695
If you make this
putt, you get the job.

420
00:14:56,696 --> 00:15:00,639
Can't we just... just do
the interview, please?

421
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:01,840
It's just a putt, Brooke.

422
00:15:01,841 --> 00:15:03,892
Sir, I don't think that
my getting this promotion

423
00:15:03,893 --> 00:15:05,494
should be based on
me making that putt.

424
00:15:05,495 --> 00:15:07,726
It should definitely be
based on my abilities.

425
00:15:07,727 --> 00:15:10,599
[CHUCKLES] Really?

426
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:13,002
Yes, sir.

427
00:15:13,003 --> 00:15:14,143
You can't do it, can you?

428
00:15:14,144 --> 00:15:19,058
I didn't say can't.

429
00:15:19,059 --> 00:15:20,529
All right.

430
00:15:20,530 --> 00:15:21,530
Thank you.

431
00:15:23,974 --> 00:15:25,334
Take your time.

432
00:15:25,335 --> 00:15:26,046
Most definitely.

433
00:15:26,047 --> 00:15:27,536
Let me get my shot lined up.

434
00:15:27,537 --> 00:15:30,889
Now see, one great putt,
one great marketing director

435
00:15:30,890 --> 00:15:31,391
coming up.

436
00:15:31,391 --> 00:15:31,891
Great.

437
00:15:31,891 --> 00:15:32,891
All right.

438
00:15:42,562 --> 00:15:43,872
So let me get this right.

439
00:15:43,873 --> 00:15:46,255
You putted for your
promotion, babe?

440
00:15:46,256 --> 00:15:47,606
I had to.

441
00:15:47,607 --> 00:15:49,279
You know how bad
I want that job.

442
00:15:52,052 --> 00:15:53,202
What?

443
00:15:53,203 --> 00:15:56,895
You know what a move up
like that would mean for me?

444
00:15:56,896 --> 00:15:59,168
For us.

445
00:15:59,169 --> 00:16:00,329
So he challenged you.

446
00:16:00,330 --> 00:16:02,561
Yes, he challenged me.

447
00:16:02,562 --> 00:16:03,463
Ugh.

448
00:16:03,464 --> 00:16:04,533
All right.

449
00:16:04,534 --> 00:16:05,175
What happened next?

450
00:16:05,176 --> 00:16:07,586
Well, after
embarrassing myself... OK,

451
00:16:07,587 --> 00:16:09,068
he tells me that he
knows me well enough

452
00:16:09,069 --> 00:16:10,399
to know that I wasn't
going to back down

453
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:11,460
from a challenge, right?

454
00:16:11,461 --> 00:16:13,852
So then he says, I'll
give you a second chance

455
00:16:13,853 --> 00:16:15,524
with this new product launch.

456
00:16:15,525 --> 00:16:16,516
Sounds kind of interesting.

457
00:16:16,517 --> 00:16:18,517
What... what kind of product?

458
00:16:18,518 --> 00:16:19,989
A clothing line
they want to target

459
00:16:19,990 --> 00:16:21,260
after a younger audience.

460
00:16:21,261 --> 00:16:27,356
So my mission is to think out
of the box, whatever that is.

461
00:16:27,357 --> 00:16:28,857
[SNAPS_FINGERS] You
know what you should do?

462
00:16:28,858 --> 00:16:29,739
What?

463
00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:33,112
You should do a
throw back function.

464
00:16:33,113 --> 00:16:34,993
You know, like... like
these old school parties.

465
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:35,845
You know what I'm saying?

466
00:16:35,846 --> 00:16:37,116
I think people would
really like that.

467
00:16:37,117 --> 00:16:38,157
That's what you think?

468
00:16:38,158 --> 00:16:38,658
Yeah.

469
00:16:38,659 --> 00:16:40,139
That's a cute idea,
and you're cute.

470
00:16:40,140 --> 00:16:41,560
But I don't think that'll work.

471
00:16:41,561 --> 00:16:42,492
I don't wanna bore the kids.

472
00:16:42,492 --> 00:16:43,193
You know what I mean?

473
00:16:43,194 --> 00:16:46,095
I wanna attract them,
not bore them to death.

474
00:16:46,096 --> 00:16:47,376
But I love you.

475
00:16:47,377 --> 00:16:48,298
All right.

476
00:16:48,298 --> 00:16:48,798
Cool.

477
00:16:48,798 --> 00:16:49,299
[PHONE_RINGS]

478
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:50,589
Oh, I gotta go.

479
00:16:50,590 --> 00:16:54,033
But listen, I took the liberty
of booking us reservations

480
00:16:54,034 --> 00:16:56,265
at Le Bistro to
celebrate later on, OK?

481
00:16:56,266 --> 00:16:56,766
OK.

482
00:16:56,767 --> 00:16:58,207
What are we celebrating?

483
00:16:58,208 --> 00:16:59,438
I didn't get the promotion.

484
00:16:59,439 --> 00:17:00,230
Well, no.

485
00:17:00,230 --> 00:17:00,960
We're gonna celebrate.

486
00:17:00,961 --> 00:17:04,473
We're gonna celebrate,
um, you and me.

Give me cheek.

cartoon or something.

00:18:52,772 --> 00:18:54,223
Yup, it was good
seeing you too.

559
00:18:54,224 --> 00:18:55,334
Have a good evening.

560
00:18:55,335 --> 00:18:56,505
Bye.

561
00:18:56,506 --> 00:18:58,827
Nice meeting you, Brandy.

562
00:18:58,828 --> 00:18:59,359
Brooke, Brooke.

563
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:00,360
Her name's...

564
00:19:00,361 --> 00:19:01,700
Your butt's falling out.

565
00:19:01,701 --> 00:19:02,652
- Stop.
- It is.

566
00:19:02,652 --> 00:19:03,153
I mean...

567
00:19:03,153 --> 00:19:03,923
Don't do that.

568
00:19:03,923 --> 00:19:04,424
It's fine.

569
00:19:04,425 --> 00:19:06,295
Clearly, she's from the
skanky area of your past.

570
00:19:06,296 --> 00:19:06,786
Why?

571
00:19:06,786 --> 00:19:07,287
Why?

572
00:19:07,287 --> 00:19:08,168
No, just chill out.

573
00:19:08,169 --> 00:19:09,448
Just relax.

574
00:19:09,449 --> 00:19:10,749
Why do you have to be so...

575
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:11,561
That was rude.

576
00:19:11,561 --> 00:19:12,262
She sat at our table.

577
00:19:12,262 --> 00:19:13,092
WAITRESS (OFFSCREEN): Hi.

578
00:19:13,092 --> 00:19:13,743
Hey.

579
00:19:13,744 --> 00:19:15,454
Flowers for the lady.

580
00:19:15,455 --> 00:19:16,975
Flowers for the lady.

581
00:19:16,976 --> 00:19:17,637
Thank you.

582
00:19:17,638 --> 00:19:19,668
Good save.

583
00:19:19,669 --> 00:19:20,869
I love orchids.

584
00:19:20,870 --> 00:19:22,591
Me too.

585
00:19:22,592 --> 00:19:28,126
I wish my man was half
as romantic as yours.

586
00:19:28,127 --> 00:19:30,359
Oh, sweetie, is
something in your eye?

587
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:31,470
Oh, I'm sorry.

588
00:19:31,471 --> 00:19:32,352
Sorry.

589
00:19:32,352 --> 00:19:32,852
Sorry.

590
00:19:32,853 --> 00:19:34,743
You might wanna get
something for that.

591
00:19:34,744 --> 00:19:35,665
Check please.

592
00:19:35,666 --> 00:19:37,135
I guess we'll just
wrap everything up here.

593
00:19:37,136 --> 00:19:38,527
We'll take the check please.

594
00:19:38,528 --> 00:19:39,419
Yeah.

595
00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:41,230
No problem.

596
00:19:41,231 --> 00:19:43,742
Look, I'm... I'm sorry, babe.

597
00:19:43,743 --> 00:19:46,004
To... tonight wasn't
supposed to go like that.

598
00:19:46,005 --> 00:19:46,936
Don't worry about it, baby.

599
00:19:46,936 --> 00:19:47,437
It's OK.

600
00:19:47,438 --> 00:19:49,798
I... I didn't know she was gonna
be coming through with that ass

601
00:19:49,799 --> 00:19:50,300
and... and...

602
00:19:50,301 --> 00:19:51,510
Whoa, with the what?

603
00:19:51,511 --> 00:19:52,651
Not the ass.

604
00:19:52,652 --> 00:19:54,693
With no class.

605
00:19:54,694 --> 00:19:58,036
It was... it was... it was totally
just... I don't know what to...

606
00:19:58,037 --> 00:19:59,648
I got to get out of
here, like, ooh gosh.

607
00:19:59,649 --> 00:20:00,540
I'm ready to go.

608
00:20:00,541 --> 00:20:02,671
Can you... can you...

609
00:20:02,672 --> 00:20:04,793
And your check.

610
00:20:04,794 --> 00:20:05,645
You gonna pay?

611
00:20:05,645 --> 00:20:06,516
No, I am not going to pay.

612
00:20:06,516 --> 00:20:07,267
No, I'll take...

613
00:20:07,267 --> 00:20:08,027
Oh, I just...

614
00:20:08,027 --> 00:20:08,878
I'll take care of it.

615
00:20:08,878 --> 00:20:09,399
WAITRESS (OFFSCREEN):
She looks so strong.

616
00:20:09,399 --> 00:20:10,089
She's strong.

617
00:20:10,089 --> 00:20:10,650
No, no she is.

618
00:20:10,650 --> 00:20:11,150
That I am.

619
00:20:11,150 --> 00:20:12,091
That I am.

620
00:20:12,092 --> 00:20:13,222
Everything's inside.

621
00:20:13,223 --> 00:20:13,793
BROOKE (OFFSCREEN):
Drop that on the table.

622
00:20:13,793 --> 00:20:14,534
Wheel it back a bit.

623
00:20:14,534 --> 00:20:15,425
Thank you.

624
00:20:15,426 --> 00:20:16,665
I'll be over here
if you need me.

625
00:20:16,666 --> 00:20:17,407
OK.
Bye.

626
00:20:17,407 --> 00:20:18,097
Thank you.

627
00:20:18,098 --> 00:20:19,498
OK, OK, OK.

628
00:20:19,499 --> 00:20:20,849
Goodbye to you and your butt.

629
00:20:20,850 --> 00:20:21,351
Time to go.

630
00:20:21,351 --> 00:20:22,001
Can you just stop?

631
00:20:22,002 --> 00:20:23,592
Can you help me work out
this gratuity please?

632
00:20:23,593 --> 00:20:24,173
No, I will not.

633
00:20:24,174 --> 00:20:25,294
You good with the math.

634
00:20:25,295 --> 00:20:26,905
You... you do that.

635
00:20:26,906 --> 00:20:28,577
Use your brain on that
instead of thinking about...

636
00:20:28,578 --> 00:20:29,379
Use my brain?

637
00:20:29,379 --> 00:20:30,330
No.

638
00:20:30,331 --> 00:20:31,570
- Now is not the time.
- Your mind is everywhere.

639
00:20:31,571 --> 00:20:32,542
Now is not the time, Kent.

640
00:20:32,543 --> 00:20:34,983
Just put it... oh, god.

641
00:20:34,984 --> 00:20:35,984
All right.

642
00:20:41,991 --> 00:20:43,762
DANIELLE (OFFSCREEN): Ooh,
you know what we could do?

643
00:20:43,763 --> 00:20:46,194
We could do high
mimosas, not high tea.

644
00:20:46,195 --> 00:20:46,716
Mimosas?

645
00:20:46,716 --> 00:20:47,587
DANIELLE (OFFSCREEN): Yes.

646
00:20:47,588 --> 00:20:48,647
You always want a cocktail.

647
00:20:48,648 --> 00:20:49,148
No, honey.

648
00:20:49,149 --> 00:20:52,921
Today we are having
tea and crumpets.

649
00:20:52,922 --> 00:20:53,863
OK.

650
00:20:53,864 --> 00:20:57,075
Romantic restaurant,
your favorite flowers,

651
00:20:57,076 --> 00:20:59,998
and dessert on a silver platter?

652
00:20:59,999 --> 00:21:01,229
Hello, honey.

653
00:21:01,230 --> 00:21:03,962
Sounds to me like you just
ruined a perfect proposal.

654
00:21:03,963 --> 00:21:04,644
I didn't ruin it.

655
00:21:04,645 --> 00:21:05,844
Those girls ruined it.

656
00:21:05,845 --> 00:21:07,816
But Brooke, you don't have
anything to worry about.

657
00:21:07,817 --> 00:21:11,009
I mean, if Kent is as
perfect as you say he is,

658
00:21:11,010 --> 00:21:11,941
he'll propose again.

659
00:21:11,942 --> 00:21:14,403
I'm not worried, Danielle.

660
00:21:14,404 --> 00:21:15,375
Yeah.

661
00:21:15,376 --> 00:21:17,486
No one ever is, Brooky.

662
00:21:17,487 --> 00:21:20,228
I mean, look at me.

663
00:21:20,229 --> 00:21:24,092
I never would have
believed it about Tony

664
00:21:24,093 --> 00:21:27,626
or Lloyd or Clarence.

665
00:21:27,627 --> 00:21:28,717
Oh, my gosh.

666
00:21:28,718 --> 00:21:31,079
Or Mario.

667
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:33,472
[LAUGHING]

668
00:21:33,473 --> 00:21:34,434
DANIELLE (OFFSCREEN): What?

669
00:21:34,434 --> 00:21:35,395
Nothing.

670
00:21:35,396 --> 00:21:38,717
Well, I don't have to worry,
because Kent is reformed.

671
00:21:38,718 --> 00:21:40,128
Ugh, face reality, Brooke.

672
00:21:40,129 --> 00:21:40,690
All men cheat.

673
00:21:40,690 --> 00:21:41,190
Uh-uh.

674
00:21:41,190 --> 00:21:42,051
Wait, hold up, honey.

675
00:21:42,052 --> 00:21:43,822
All men do not cheat.

676
00:21:43,823 --> 00:21:44,883
They don't.

677
00:21:44,884 --> 00:21:45,395
OK?

678
00:21:45,396 --> 00:21:47,856
And I think Kent
is one who doesn't.

679
00:21:47,857 --> 00:21:48,358
Thank you.

680
00:21:48,359 --> 00:21:51,309
Well, I mean, at
least I don't think so.

681
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:52,891
Oh, well, thank you.

682
00:21:52,892 --> 00:21:53,823
SOPHIA (OFFSCREEN): Come on.

683
00:21:53,823 --> 00:21:54,754
It's the truth.

684
00:21:54,755 --> 00:21:57,295
Well, there's one way
that you can know for sure.

685
00:21:57,296 --> 00:21:59,037
You could give him the MS test.

686
00:21:59,038 --> 00:22:00,369
And what is that?

687
00:22:00,370 --> 00:22:03,792
Why do you think that
I am still single?

688
00:22:03,793 --> 00:22:06,294
Well, there's a lot of reasons.

689
00:22:06,295 --> 00:22:08,266
I mean, it could be because
you're a little bit of a picky

690
00:22:08,267 --> 00:22:09,128
bitch, but...

691
00:22:09,129 --> 00:22:10,318
Stop it, OK?

692
00:22:10,319 --> 00:22:11,700
We're going to be nice today.

693
00:22:11,701 --> 00:22:12,801
No, Brooke.

694
00:22:12,802 --> 00:22:16,214
It's because all my men
have failed the MS test.

695
00:22:16,215 --> 00:22:17,416
Like multiple sclerosis?

696
00:22:17,417 --> 00:22:18,807
I'm not understanding.

697
00:22:18,808 --> 00:22:19,318
Keep it up.

698
00:22:19,318 --> 00:22:19,939
Keep it up.

699
00:22:19,939 --> 00:22:20,740
Girl, I don't like ugly.

700
00:22:20,741 --> 00:22:21,770
Get to the MS test please.

701
00:22:21,771 --> 00:22:22,931
What is it?

702
00:22:22,932 --> 00:22:24,443
It's not what.

703
00:22:24,444 --> 00:22:26,044
It's who.

704
00:22:26,045 --> 00:22:28,607
She's called the man stealer.

705
00:22:28,608 --> 00:22:32,391
[CHUCKLES] And she is one woman
you do not want anywhere near

706
00:22:32,392 --> 00:22:35,534
your man if you want
to keep him, that is.

707
00:22:35,535 --> 00:22:38,657
Now, none of her clients
have ever seen her in person.

708
00:22:38,658 --> 00:22:40,419
But I'm willing to
guess that she's

709
00:22:40,420 --> 00:22:44,423
got the body of a
Victoria's Secret model

710
00:22:44,424 --> 00:22:46,895
and the face of a goddess.

711
00:22:46,896 --> 00:22:51,099
You know, wherever she goes,
men lose their freaking minds.

712
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:52,521
You know Stacy Shaw?

713
00:22:52,522 --> 00:22:53,952
BROOKE (OFFSCREEN): Mm.

714
00:22:53,953 --> 00:22:57,165
DANIELLE (OFFSCREEN): She said
her ex certainly lost his.

715
00:22:57,166 --> 00:22:59,648
And apparently, a lot
of men fall for her

716
00:22:59,649 --> 00:23:02,791
because her website
boasts a 99% success rate.

717
00:23:02,792 --> 00:23:05,774
It bring out the
inner Fido in all men.

718
00:23:05,775 --> 00:23:07,085
You know the 1%?

719
00:23:07,086 --> 00:23:09,588
Yeah, they're probably gay.

720
00:23:09,589 --> 00:23:13,442
But whatever she looks like,
one thing's for certain.

721
00:23:13,443 --> 00:23:18,236
Only men with true love in their
hearts can pass the MS test.

722
00:23:18,237 --> 00:23:21,279
Well, in that case,
Kent would ace the test.

723
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:25,654
[CHUCKLES] Well, there's
only one way to find out.

724
00:23:25,655 --> 00:23:29,297
Are you challenging my love,
my four year relationship?

725
00:23:29,298 --> 00:23:30,669
SOPHIA (OFFSCREEN):
Brooke, careful.

726
00:23:30,670 --> 00:23:31,410
Careful.

727
00:23:31,411 --> 00:23:32,981
Don't go looking
for trouble, OK?

728
00:23:32,982 --> 00:23:34,703
Because people that go
looking for trouble...

729
00:23:34,704 --> 00:23:35,965
They normally find it.

730
00:23:38,598 --> 00:23:40,268
To the perfect couple.

731
00:23:40,269 --> 00:23:44,192
That would be me and William.

732
00:23:44,193 --> 00:23:45,554
To the perfect couple.

733
00:23:45,555 --> 00:23:46,735
Here's to you and Kent.

734
00:23:46,736 --> 00:23:48,126

735
00:23:48,127 --> 00:23:49,998
Cheers.

736
00:23:49,999 --> 00:23:51,860
What do we have here?

737
00:23:51,861 --> 00:23:53,141
What are we celebrating, ladies?

738
00:23:56,345 --> 00:23:57,216
Uh, OK.

739
00:23:57,217 --> 00:23:58,787
I see what this is.

I'm good.

923
00:31:14,063 --> 00:31:17,535
Oh, I didn't tell you I
was having lunch with Doug?

924
00:31:17,536 --> 00:31:18,037
Yeah.

925
00:31:18,038 --> 00:31:21,679
We're having lunch with
that photographer too.

926
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:22,541
No.

927
00:31:22,542 --> 00:31:23,892
Is she pretty?

928
00:31:23,893 --> 00:31:25,894
Hell yea, she's...

929
00:31:25,895 --> 00:31:26,895
No, no.

930
00:31:26,896 --> 00:31:28,106
She... she all right.

931
00:31:28,107 --> 00:31:29,537
I mean, you know, whatever.

932
00:31:29,538 --> 00:31:31,719
But you ain't got
nothing to worry about.

933
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:33,171
[CHUCKLES]

934
00:31:33,172 --> 00:31:35,103
Yeah.

935
00:31:35,104 --> 00:31:35,604
I know.

936
00:31:35,605 --> 00:31:36,894
OK.

937
00:31:36,895 --> 00:31:38,396
Well, I'll... I'll
see you later on.

938
00:31:38,397 --> 00:31:38,897
All right.

939
00:31:38,898 --> 00:31:40,308
I love you, too, baby.

940
00:31:40,309 --> 00:31:42,600
Bye, baby.

941
00:31:42,601 --> 00:31:43,212
I'm terrible.

942
00:31:43,213 --> 00:31:45,113
I cannot believe I let
you talk me into this.

943
00:31:45,114 --> 00:31:46,055
Oh, come on.

944
00:31:46,056 --> 00:31:47,936
This is the only way you'll
ever know the true Kent.

945
00:31:47,937 --> 00:31:50,148
Was that the warden?

946
00:31:50,149 --> 00:31:50,649
No, man.

947
00:31:50,649 --> 00:31:51,620
It was your mother.

948
00:31:51,621 --> 00:31:53,922
You know, me and her have
been hanging out a lot lately.

949
00:31:53,923 --> 00:31:56,224
You know, I never knew
she was a freak like that.

950
00:31:56,225 --> 00:31:57,026
Your mother's special.

951
00:31:57,026 --> 00:31:57,526
Wow.

952
00:31:57,526 --> 00:31:58,027
That's right.

953
00:31:58,027 --> 00:31:58,817
That's right.

954
00:31:58,817 --> 00:31:59,618
That's right.

955
00:31:59,618 --> 00:32:00,119
I'm playing.

956
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:02,380
Look, I... I just need
you to just sit here

957
00:32:02,381 --> 00:32:03,711
and have lunch with
us and be cool.

958
00:32:03,712 --> 00:32:04,812
I will Dude, I
already told you.

959
00:32:04,813 --> 00:32:05,893
I got you, all right?

960
00:32:05,894 --> 00:32:07,275
I mean, but personally, I
don't... I don't even understand

961
00:32:07,276 --> 00:32:07,796
why I'm here.

962
00:32:07,797 --> 00:32:09,687
I mean... I mean, to
be honest with you,

963
00:32:09,688 --> 00:32:11,639
I certainly wouldn't invite
you to be a third wheel if I

964
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:13,811
was having lunch with, like,
Miss December or somebody,

965
00:32:13,812 --> 00:32:14,333
you know.

966
00:32:14,334 --> 00:32:18,606
I mean, not unless, you
know, she wanted it that way.

967
00:32:18,607 --> 00:32:20,108
Does... does she... does
she want it that way?

968
00:32:20,109 --> 00:32:20,849
Did you ask her?

969
00:32:20,850 --> 00:32:23,081
I'm... I'm saying, like,
you know, she... she wants...

970
00:32:23,082 --> 00:32:24,302
Hey, Kent.

971
00:32:24,303 --> 00:32:25,683
Hey, Doug.

972
00:32:25,684 --> 00:32:26,415
Oh, I'm sorry.

973
00:32:26,416 --> 00:32:28,376
Did I interrupt something here?

974
00:32:28,377 --> 00:32:29,068
No.

975
00:32:29,068 --> 00:32:29,738
No, not at all.

976
00:32:29,738 --> 00:32:30,309
Absolutely not.

977
00:32:30,310 --> 00:32:31,609
As a matter of fact,
I was just telling

978
00:32:31,610 --> 00:32:33,341
Kent I am really
sorry I will not

979
00:32:33,342 --> 00:32:34,892
be able to join you
two for lunch today.

980
00:32:34,893 --> 00:32:36,024
Yes.

981
00:32:36,025 --> 00:32:36,525
Yeah.

982
00:32:36,526 --> 00:32:37,625
Booty... duty calls.

983
00:32:37,626 --> 00:32:38,297
You got that, right?

984
00:32:38,298 --> 00:32:40,238
All right then.

985
00:32:40,239 --> 00:32:41,689
Uh.

986
00:32:41,690 --> 00:32:43,391
What a jerk off.

987
00:32:43,392 --> 00:32:44,273
So what's up?

988
00:32:44,274 --> 00:32:45,573
How you doing?

989
00:32:45,574 --> 00:32:46,385
Oh, I'm good.

990
00:32:46,385 --> 00:32:46,885
I'm good.

991
00:32:46,886 --> 00:32:49,097
I'm glad you could come out.

992
00:32:49,098 --> 00:32:50,999
You're... you're out.

993
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:51,860
Absolutely.

994
00:32:51,860 --> 00:32:52,721
You're really...

995
00:32:52,722 --> 00:32:54,012
And thank you for having me.

996
00:32:54,013 --> 00:32:55,513
No problem.

997
00:32:55,514 --> 00:32:56,435
Gotta love Doug.

998
00:32:56,436 --> 00:32:59,617
He's so dedicated to the job.

999
00:32:59,618 --> 00:33:02,890
I get the feeling you
are just as dedicated.

1000
00:33:02,891 --> 00:33:03,392
I'm sorry.

1001
00:33:03,393 --> 00:33:04,762
Would you like
something to drink?

1002
00:33:04,763 --> 00:33:07,765
Coffee, tea, water,
maybe some wine?

1003
00:33:07,766 --> 00:33:08,916
Take the edge off.

1004
00:33:08,917 --> 00:33:10,528
Hey, what, you trying
to get me drunk already?

1005
00:33:10,529 --> 00:33:11,260
No, it's OK.

1006
00:33:11,261 --> 00:33:13,251
I never drink when
I'm on the job.

1007
00:33:13,252 --> 00:33:15,293
I'll take a water.

1008
00:33:15,294 --> 00:33:19,627
Speaking of job, why'd
you become a firefighter?

1009
00:33:19,628 --> 00:33:23,191
Oh, to rescue, uh,
damsels in distress.

1010
00:33:23,192 --> 00:33:23,812
Oh.

1011
00:33:23,812 --> 00:33:24,593
Thank you.

1012
00:33:24,594 --> 00:33:25,973
No, I'm just kidding.

1013
00:33:25,974 --> 00:33:27,355
It's a little firehouse humor.

1014
00:33:27,356 --> 00:33:30,398
I... I guess I just
wanted to help people.

1015
00:33:30,399 --> 00:33:31,399
Oh.

1016
00:33:33,722 --> 00:33:38,516
So how long have you
been rescuing damsels?

1017
00:33:38,517 --> 00:33:42,400
[CHUCKLES] All my life.

1018
00:33:42,401 --> 00:33:46,023
No, no, uh, I've been on the
force for about eight years

1019
00:33:46,024 --> 00:33:49,307
now, eight proud years.

1020
00:33:49,308 --> 00:33:52,220
They look really cozy
together, don't they?

1021
00:33:52,221 --> 00:33:54,422
Ooh, I wonder what
they're saying.

1022
00:33:54,423 --> 00:33:56,394
(HIGH PITCHED) I wonder
what they're saying.

1023
00:33:56,395 --> 00:33:57,865
You're too happy for this.

1024
00:33:57,866 --> 00:33:58,407
Mm-hmm.

1025
00:33:58,408 --> 00:34:00,408
Well, you know there's only one
way we're going to find out.

1026
00:34:00,409 --> 00:34:01,390
What?

1027
00:34:01,391 --> 00:34:02,870
What are you doing?

1028
00:34:02,871 --> 00:34:04,492
Well, I'm going to
see if Mr. Wonderful's

1029
00:34:04,493 --> 00:34:06,424
as perfect as you say he is.

1030
00:34:06,425 --> 00:34:09,817
He is, Danielle.

1031
00:34:09,818 --> 00:34:11,240
Are you always this charming?

1032
00:34:14,163 --> 00:34:15,633
Let me get another
one of these.

1033
00:34:15,634 --> 00:34:17,095
Excuse us.

1034
00:34:17,096 --> 00:34:18,077
Excuse me.

1035
00:34:18,078 --> 00:34:19,537
Ooh, duck.

1036
00:34:19,538 --> 00:34:21,008
Duck.

1037
00:34:21,009 --> 00:34:24,452
And here you've got candles,
some lingerie, you know?

1038
00:34:24,453 --> 00:34:26,654
You work that out,
girl. [INAUDIBLE].

1039
00:34:26,655 --> 00:34:28,055
Danielle, this is silly.

1040
00:34:28,056 --> 00:34:32,140
If we just get a little closer,
we can hear their conversation.

1041
00:34:32,141 --> 00:34:33,041
Please.

1042
00:34:33,041 --> 00:34:33,742
All right.

1043
00:34:33,743 --> 00:34:35,553
Look, I just wanna
see who this woman is.

1044
00:34:35,554 --> 00:34:36,044
[SIGHS]

1045
00:34:36,045 --> 00:34:37,895
Come on.

1046
00:34:37,896 --> 00:34:39,287
Sorry.

1047
00:34:39,288 --> 00:34:41,739
So the hours are grueling, huh?

1048
00:34:41,740 --> 00:34:47,455
Gosh, it must be hard
for your... girlfriend?

1049
00:34:47,456 --> 00:34:48,367
The readers want to know.

1050
00:34:48,367 --> 00:34:48,867
Trust me.

1051
00:34:48,868 --> 00:34:50,868
It makes for a better profile.

1052
00:34:50,869 --> 00:34:52,520
Oh.

1053
00:34:52,521 --> 00:34:57,365
In that case, uh, yeah, I guess
it's kind of tough on her.

1054
00:34:57,366 --> 00:35:00,398
I have to spend a lot
of time away from her.

1055
00:35:00,399 --> 00:35:01,529
Brooke.

1056
00:35:01,530 --> 00:35:02,060
That's her name.

1057
00:35:02,060 --> 00:35:02,991
Brooke.

1058
00:35:02,992 --> 00:35:04,382
Oh, he said your name.

1059
00:35:04,383 --> 00:35:06,073
He said your name.

1060
00:35:06,074 --> 00:35:07,505
Aren't you
interested in jotting

1061
00:35:07,506 --> 00:35:09,807
all this juicy info down?

1062
00:35:09,808 --> 00:35:11,689
Oh, honey, trust me.

1063
00:35:11,690 --> 00:35:15,203
I've got a mental file
like a steel trap.

1064
00:35:15,204 --> 00:35:16,904
So it's, uh, tough for Brooke.

1065
00:35:16,905 --> 00:35:17,406
Keep going.

1066
00:35:17,407 --> 00:35:19,287
Um, yeah.

1067
00:35:19,288 --> 00:35:21,038
It's kind of tough on her.

1068
00:35:21,039 --> 00:35:23,020
I mean, um, matter
of fact, we were

1069
00:35:23,021 --> 00:35:24,922
supposed to have
lunch together today.

1070
00:35:24,923 --> 00:35:25,854
Oh, no.

1071
00:35:25,855 --> 00:35:27,395
Did I get you in
trouble or anything.

1072
00:35:27,396 --> 00:35:28,287
Or...

1073
00:35:28,287 --> 00:35:29,097
No.

1074
00:35:29,097 --> 00:35:29,678
No, no.

1075
00:35:29,678 --> 00:35:30,179
OK.

1076
00:35:30,180 --> 00:35:31,869
It's OK.

1077
00:35:31,870 --> 00:35:33,241
Brooke is cool.

1078
00:35:33,242 --> 00:35:34,932
See?

1079
00:35:34,933 --> 00:35:35,864
We gotta go.

1080
00:35:35,864 --> 00:35:36,775
Oh, gosh.

1081
00:35:36,776 --> 00:35:37,815
Let's go, please.

1082
00:35:37,816 --> 00:35:38,317
Right.

1083
00:35:38,317 --> 00:35:39,007
Oh, wait, wait, wait.

1084
00:35:39,008 --> 00:35:40,368
No, we haven't
seen her face yet.

1085
00:35:40,369 --> 00:35:41,350
I'm gonna get busted.

1086
00:35:41,350 --> 00:35:42,311
Let's go, Danielle.

1087
00:35:42,311 --> 00:35:42,961
All right.

1088
00:35:42,961 --> 00:35:43,961

I am so... I'm so sorry, ma'am.

1091
00:35:54,313 --> 00:35:55,463
Let me help you clean that up.

1092
00:35:55,464 --> 00:35:57,325
Can we get a wet nap over here?

1093
00:35:57,326 --> 00:35:59,587
I'm so sorry... that was my bad.

1094
00:35:59,588 --> 00:36:00,828
It was... I'm sorry.

1095
00:36:00,829 --> 00:36:01,660
Let me get that for you.

[INAUDIBLE]

1098
00:36:08,407 --> 00:36:09,637
Can we get a
napkin or something?

1099
00:36:09,638 --> 00:36:10,619
That's crazy.

1100
00:36:10,619 --> 00:36:11,580
I know.

1101
00:36:11,580 --> 00:36:12,181

Yeah, the whole situation
was crazy, right?

1284
00:41:32,501 --> 00:41:33,921
I mean, Tiger was a freak.

1285
00:41:33,922 --> 00:41:36,463
He had stripper after stripper
coming out, porn stars.

1286
00:41:36,464 --> 00:41:37,855
Bang, bang, bang, bang.

1287
00:41:37,856 --> 00:41:38,657
Man.

1288
00:41:38,658 --> 00:41:40,077
Yeah, man.

1289
00:41:40,078 --> 00:41:41,358
It's like your
man [? Tee Howe?]

1290
00:41:41,359 --> 00:41:47,134
Said in that flick, ain't
nothing better than a woman.

1291
00:41:47,135 --> 00:41:50,217
So the new woman.

1292
00:41:50,218 --> 00:41:51,218
Oh.

1293
00:41:54,022 --> 00:41:54,913
Yeah, man.

1294
00:41:54,914 --> 00:41:57,194
You know, I bet you
know all about that.

1295
00:41:57,195 --> 00:41:58,405
I bet you they be
throwing it at you

1296
00:41:58,406 --> 00:42:02,700
like you skinny
Luther or something.

1297
00:42:02,701 --> 00:42:03,501
No, no.

1298
00:42:03,502 --> 00:42:04,822
I'm cool, man.

1299
00:42:04,823 --> 00:42:07,034
I'm trying to stay on
the straight and narrow,

1300
00:42:07,035 --> 00:42:08,836
do the husband and
wife thing like you.

1301
00:42:08,837 --> 00:42:09,887
You know what I'm saying?

1302
00:42:09,888 --> 00:42:11,929
Look, but don't touch, right?

1303
00:42:11,930 --> 00:42:12,941
Yeah, man.

1304
00:42:16,184 --> 00:42:17,145
Hey, hey, hey.

1305
00:42:17,145 --> 00:42:17,806
Hey, baby.

1306
00:42:17,806 --> 00:42:18,306
Hey.

1307
00:42:18,307 --> 00:42:19,727
That looks good [INAUDIBLE].

1308
00:42:19,728 --> 00:42:20,679
You know it does.

1309
00:42:20,680 --> 00:42:22,089
Mm.

1310
00:42:22,090 --> 00:42:24,552
BROOKE (OFFSCREEN):
You all right?

1311
00:42:24,553 --> 00:42:25,053
[INAUDIBLE]

1312
00:42:25,053 --> 00:42:25,554
What?

1313
00:42:25,555 --> 00:42:29,236
He's a great role
model, isn't he?

1314
00:42:29,237 --> 00:42:29,738
All right.

1315
00:42:29,739 --> 00:42:30,968
So I didn't put a lot
of cheese because we're

1316
00:42:30,969 --> 00:42:31,880
staying the night.
Oh.

1317
00:42:31,881 --> 00:42:33,230
Oh, cool, thanks.

1318
00:42:33,231 --> 00:42:34,542
I don't like a lot of cheese.

1319
00:42:39,547 --> 00:42:40,988
It's a little Frisbee, huh?

1320
00:42:40,989 --> 00:42:41,870
All right.

1321
00:42:41,870 --> 00:42:42,721
This is my forte.

1322
00:42:42,721 --> 00:42:43,271
I see.

1323
00:42:43,272 --> 00:42:44,301
You gonna show me what you got?

1324
00:42:44,302 --> 00:42:45,173
You like games?

1325
00:42:45,174 --> 00:42:46,253
I love games.

1326
00:42:46,254 --> 00:42:48,275
I play them all the time.

1327
00:42:48,276 --> 00:42:50,688
Oh, I bet.

1328
00:42:50,689 --> 00:42:51,650
All right.

1329
00:42:51,651 --> 00:42:55,352
You just gotta stay
focused, nice and easy.

1330
00:42:55,353 --> 00:42:55,854
Oh.

1331
00:42:55,854 --> 00:42:56,854
Beautiful.

1332
00:42:59,858 --> 00:43:00,858
Let's see.

1333
00:43:00,859 --> 00:43:01,780
Wow.

1334
00:43:01,780 --> 00:43:02,721
All right.

1335
00:43:02,721 --> 00:43:03,672
OK.

1336
00:43:03,673 --> 00:43:05,092
Oh, God.

1337
00:43:05,093 --> 00:43:05,694
Oh, wow.

1338
00:43:05,695 --> 00:43:09,106
That's... do the second one.

1339
00:43:09,107 --> 00:43:09,608
OK.

1340
00:43:09,608 --> 00:43:10,108
That happens.

1341
00:43:10,108 --> 00:43:10,729
It happens.

1342
00:43:10,729 --> 00:43:11,229
All right.

1343
00:43:11,229 --> 00:43:12,160
Let me show you.

1344
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:12,661
OK.

1345
00:43:12,661 --> 00:43:13,612
Grab it right there.

1346
00:43:13,612 --> 00:43:14,112
Mm-hmm.

1347
00:43:14,112 --> 00:43:14,613
Good.

1348
00:43:14,614 --> 00:43:16,053
Back up into it.

1349
00:43:16,054 --> 00:43:17,504
Yeah, don't be shy.

1350
00:43:17,505 --> 00:43:18,476
OK.

1351
00:43:18,476 --> 00:43:19,377
Oh, yeah.

1352
00:43:19,377 --> 00:43:20,178
You know what?

1353
00:43:20,179 --> 00:43:21,358
I need to freshen up a bit.

1354
00:43:21,359 --> 00:43:22,820
Where is the little girls' room?

1355
00:43:22,821 --> 00:43:24,411
Um, just over there.

1356
00:43:24,412 --> 00:43:25,193
That way?

1357
00:43:25,193 --> 00:43:25,694
Yeah.

1358
00:43:25,694 --> 00:43:26,394
OK, great.

1359
00:43:26,395 --> 00:43:27,725
Hold that for me, sweetie.

1360
00:43:27,726 --> 00:43:28,226
OK.

1361
00:43:28,226 --> 00:43:29,217
You be back now.

1362
00:43:29,218 --> 00:43:32,179
OK.

1363
00:43:32,180 --> 00:43:34,652
Whew.

1364
00:43:34,653 --> 00:43:36,634
[CELL PHONE RINGING]

1365
00:43:36,635 --> 00:43:38,055
Yo, yo.

1366
00:43:38,056 --> 00:43:39,967
Hey, babe.

1367
00:43:39,968 --> 00:43:40,998
No, no, no.

1368
00:43:40,999 --> 00:43:42,359
That's the TV.

1369
00:43:42,360 --> 00:43:43,271
Mm-hmm.

1370
00:43:43,271 --> 00:43:44,182
Yeah.

1371
00:43:44,182 --> 00:43:45,093
All right.

1372
00:43:45,093 --> 00:43:45,994
I'll see you.

1373
00:43:45,995 --> 00:43:47,195
I love you too.

1374
00:44:01,970 --> 00:44:05,632
Mm-mm-mm, you dog.

1375
00:44:05,633 --> 00:44:08,575
I hope you're ready
because this guy's a loser.

1376
00:44:08,576 --> 00:44:10,387
Oh, just like the rest.

1377
00:44:10,388 --> 00:44:11,209
I don't know.

1378
00:44:11,210 --> 00:44:13,580
Kent seems to be different.

1379
00:44:13,581 --> 00:44:14,452
Mandy.

1380
00:44:14,452 --> 00:44:15,273
What?

1381
00:44:15,273 --> 00:44:16,034
Do you like Kent?

1382
00:44:16,034 --> 00:44:16,805
Hell no.

1383
00:44:16,806 --> 00:44:17,845
He's just different.

1384
00:44:17,846 --> 00:44:18,956
Uh-huh.

1385
00:44:18,957 --> 00:44:19,808
Be careful, Mandy.

1386
00:44:19,809 --> 00:44:21,618
Don't get involved.

1387
00:44:21,619 --> 00:44:24,171
Hey, it's 99% success, not 100%.

1388
00:44:24,172 --> 00:44:25,552
Just let this one go.

1389
00:44:25,553 --> 00:44:26,054
OK.

1390
00:44:26,055 --> 00:44:28,776
I'm already planning on calling
his girlfriend and telling her

1391
00:44:28,777 --> 00:44:29,817
we're off the case.

1392
00:44:29,818 --> 00:44:30,318
All right.

1393
00:44:30,319 --> 00:44:32,810
Now let's go save another girl
from heartache because this wig

1394
00:44:32,811 --> 00:44:34,742
and these heels... child, please.

1395
00:44:34,743 --> 00:44:36,143
Woo.

1396
00:44:36,144 --> 00:44:36,945
All right.
Let's go.

1397
00:44:36,945 --> 00:44:37,445
OK.

1398
00:44:37,446 --> 00:44:39,006
Don't forget to show
me that ring, girl.

1399
00:45:05,563 --> 00:45:08,726
You know, I never
meet clients here.

1400
00:45:08,727 --> 00:45:11,648
But in your case, I
thought it was necessary.

1401
00:45:11,649 --> 00:45:12,920
You?

1402
00:45:12,921 --> 00:45:15,482
You're the man stealer.

1403
00:45:15,483 --> 00:45:16,474
Yup.

1404
00:45:16,475 --> 00:45:19,436
And I've got a 99%
success rate to prove it.

1405
00:45:19,437 --> 00:45:21,989
The reason why I called you
here is because I think Kent

1406
00:45:21,990 --> 00:45:23,450
could go in the other 1%.

1407
00:45:23,451 --> 00:45:24,972
So I'm pretty much done.

1408
00:45:24,973 --> 00:45:26,123
Oh.

1409
00:45:26,124 --> 00:45:27,815
Wait, you're done?

1410
00:45:27,816 --> 00:45:30,067
MANDY (OFFSCREEN): Yup.

1411
00:45:30,068 --> 00:45:30,999
Something wrong?

1412
00:45:30,999 --> 00:45:31,629
Uh, well, yeah.

1413
00:45:31,630 --> 00:45:33,640
I, uh, paid you for a service.

1414
00:45:33,641 --> 00:45:35,532
And it's only been a few days.

1415
00:45:35,533 --> 00:45:36,874
I thought you'd be happy.

1416
00:45:36,875 --> 00:45:38,645
Isn't this what you wanted?

1417
00:45:38,646 --> 00:45:40,397
No, it is.

1418
00:45:40,398 --> 00:45:42,349
Trust me, it is.

1419
00:45:42,350 --> 00:45:45,582
It's just I really
need to know for sure.

1420
00:45:45,583 --> 00:45:48,215
I... I need you to do
a full investigation.

1421
00:45:48,216 --> 00:45:49,777
You don't know Kent, OK?

1422
00:45:49,778 --> 00:45:53,230
He hasn't always
been squeaky clean.

1423
00:45:53,231 --> 00:45:54,361
So I just really
want to make sure

1424
00:45:54,362 --> 00:45:58,115
that he's changed, truly
changed into this, uh, 1%

1425
00:45:58,116 --> 00:45:59,867
that you speak of.

1426
00:45:59,868 --> 00:46:02,429
And, um, don't take
this the wrong way.

1427
00:46:02,430 --> 00:46:04,681
But you don't strike
me as the kind of girl

1428
00:46:04,682 --> 00:46:06,234
that he would actually
really be into.

1429
00:46:09,097 --> 00:46:09,778
OK, Brooke.

1430
00:46:09,779 --> 00:46:12,009
Let me help you out here, OK?

1431
00:46:12,010 --> 00:46:14,121
Go back to your man
and be thankful for who

1432
00:46:14,122 --> 00:46:15,953
he is because as
wonderful as you

1433
00:46:15,954 --> 00:46:17,905
as think you are
compared to me, you're

1434
00:46:17,906 --> 00:46:20,127
not unlike many of my
clients who let a good man

1435
00:46:20,128 --> 00:46:23,120
slip through their
pretty little fingers.

1436
00:46:23,121 --> 00:46:25,422
Listen, whatever your name is.

1437
00:46:25,423 --> 00:46:26,603
It's Mandy.

1438
00:46:26,604 --> 00:46:27,595
BROOKE (OFFSCREEN): Oh, Mandy?

1439
00:46:27,595 --> 00:46:28,496
Hmm.

1440
00:46:28,497 --> 00:46:30,247
Listen, Mandy.

1441
00:46:30,248 --> 00:46:31,758
I don't know who
you think you are.

1442
00:46:31,759 --> 00:46:35,642
But Kent, my man... he has
a great taste in women.

1443
00:46:35,643 --> 00:46:37,664
And you are far from perfect.

1444
00:46:37,665 --> 00:46:38,396
You're right, Brooke.

1445
00:46:38,397 --> 00:46:39,736
I'm not perfect.

1446
00:46:39,737 --> 00:46:42,850
But what a man like Kent sees
in me is pretty damn close.

1447
00:46:42,851 --> 00:46:44,091
Ha.

1448
00:46:44,092 --> 00:46:46,343
Yeah, you don't know him.

1449
00:46:46,344 --> 00:46:46,845
You're right.

1450
00:46:46,845 --> 00:46:47,765
I don't.

1451
00:46:47,766 --> 00:46:50,747
But what I do know is that
if you keep testing him,

1452
00:46:50,748 --> 00:46:52,120
he will end up
like the other 99%.

1453
00:46:54,903 --> 00:46:57,114
Is that a threat?

1454
00:46:57,115 --> 00:46:59,977
I'm just saying,
you have a good man.

1455
00:46:59,978 --> 00:47:03,450
Start appreciating him
before he gets taken.

1456
00:47:03,451 --> 00:47:06,063
Listen, honey, I take men
from their women every day.

1457
00:47:06,064 --> 00:47:07,064
It's my job.

1458
00:47:07,065 --> 00:47:10,397
But Kent... Kent, I just
might take for myself.

1459
00:47:10,398 --> 00:47:14,271
So listen, walk away from this.

1460
00:47:14,272 --> 00:47:16,663
Huh.

1461
00:47:16,664 --> 00:47:18,726
I never walk away from anything.

1462
00:47:21,709 --> 00:47:23,520
OK.

1463
00:47:23,521 --> 00:47:27,244
If this is what you want, I

00:52:38,407 --> 00:52:40,847
It... it didn't go too well.

1649
00:52:40,848 --> 00:52:43,109
It's probably because you
ain't do my man's favorite move.

1650
00:52:43,110 --> 00:52:46,263
You know, he got this
little move he like when...

1651
00:52:46,264 --> 00:52:48,014
Kent has a favorite move?

1652
00:52:48,015 --> 00:52:48,516
Oh, yeah.

1653
00:52:48,516 --> 00:52:49,016
Oh, yeah.

1654
00:52:49,017 --> 00:52:50,046
Didn't he tell you?

1655
00:52:50,047 --> 00:52:51,618
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1656
00:52:51,619 --> 00:52:53,620
Baby... as a matter of fact,
baby girl in the other room was

1657
00:52:53,621 --> 00:52:54,781
doing it right
before you came too.

1658
00:52:54,782 --> 00:52:56,763
She was like like,
bak, bak, bak.

1659
00:52:56,764 --> 00:52:58,865
Yeah, it's called
the red snapper.

1660
00:52:58,866 --> 00:53:00,707
Well, if there's gonna
be somebody freaky moving,

1661
00:53:00,708 --> 00:53:02,489
it's gonna be this woman.

1662
00:53:02,490 --> 00:53:03,381
So it's gonna be move.

1663
00:53:03,382 --> 00:53:05,522
If anyone's gonna freaky move
with Kent, it's gonna be me.

1664
00:53:05,523 --> 00:53:06,973
Girl, what the
hell are you doing?

1665
00:53:06,974 --> 00:53:07,805
Give me the information.

1666
00:53:07,805 --> 00:53:08,466
Come on now.

1667
00:53:08,467 --> 00:53:09,986
Give me the scoop, brother.

1668
00:53:09,987 --> 00:53:11,318
I'm down.

1669
00:53:11,319 --> 00:53:12,869
Don't you want to sit down?

1670
00:53:12,870 --> 00:53:13,371
No.

1671

Seriously, come on.

1672
00:53:14,692 --> 00:53:15,192
OK.

Cool.

1674
00:53:15,703 --> 00:53:16,504
You come to the jungle.

You play.

1676
00:53:17,004 --> 00:53:17,565
That's right.

That's right.

1678
00:53:18,066 --> 00:53:19,966
So first, you want
to limp to the side.

1679
00:53:19,967 --> 00:53:20,458
OK.

1680
00:53:20,459 --> 00:53:21,718
Kind of like your
leg was broke.

OK.

1686

of twitch, kind of like you

What?

1693
00:53:44,802 --> 00:53:45,563
You're an ass.

1694
00:53:45,564 --> 00:53:46,853
You are an ass.

1695
00:53:46,854 --> 00:53:48,355
Ah.

1696
00:53:48,356 --> 00:53:49,456

do that again, ever in life.

I... I need your help.

1704
00:54:06,904 --> 00:54:07,405
All right.

1705
00:54:07,405 --> 00:54:08,316
All right, Brooke.

1706
00:54:08,317 --> 00:54:12,989
Look, you have to stop
being so judgemental.

1707
00:54:12,990 --> 00:54:14,030
You gotta cut that out.

1708
00:54:14,031 --> 00:54:14,532
Stop it.

1709
00:54:14,533 --> 00:54:15,832
All right?

1710
00:54:15,833 --> 00:54:18,154
No man wants to be critiqued
about he everything he does.

1711
00:54:18,155 --> 00:54:18,816
I do that?

1712
00:54:18,816 --> 00:54:19,317
OK.

1713
00:54:19,318 --> 00:54:21,648
Next lesson, stop
debating everything.

1714

Everything is not a
debate, unless you

1715

trying to tell me
that those are real.

1716

everything, especially
from his woman.

1719
00:54:35,563 --> 00:54:37,514
Does Kent say that about me?

1720
00:54:37,515 --> 00:54:40,186
Doug, what else does he say?

1721
00:54:40,187 --> 00:54:42,729
Is he falling for Mandy?

1722
00:54:42,730 --> 00:54:44,050
Doug, hello.

1723
00:54:44,051 --> 00:54:45,332

Gosh, doesn't that get old?

Hell no.

1726
00:54:46,915 --> 00:54:48,795
How could it get old?

So many [INAUDIBLE].

1728
00:54:55,052 --> 00:54:59,746
What I do know though, Brooke,
is you were Kent's choice.

1729
00:54:59,747 --> 00:55:00,747
All right?

1730
00:55:03,130 --> 00:55:05,532
Now, I don't know.

1731
00:55:05,533 --> 00:55:06,494
Oh, god.

1732
00:55:06,495 --> 00:55:09,215
Uh, you've got to tell
me what to do then.

1733
00:55:09,216 --> 00:55:12,118
Well, specifically,
Brooke, only you know that.

1734
00:55:12,119 --> 00:55:16,853
What I do know
though is you... you

1735
00:55:16,854 --> 00:55:18,934
could do something to keep
your man's full attention.

1736
00:55:21,329 --> 00:55:24,270
I guess we're done.

1737

Ooh.

1741
00:55:38,005 --> 00:55:39,586
Now, that's how you
run a triangle offence.

1742
00:55:39,587 --> 00:55:41,358
For real, triangles.

1743
00:55:41,359 --> 00:55:42,359
Mm.

1744
00:55:42,360 --> 00:55:45,612
What about yours?

1745
00:55:45,613 --> 00:55:47,804
I don't know, D.
I mean, I didn't

1746

know it was going
to be this hard.

You know?

1748
00:55:49,798 --> 00:55:50,887
I really thought I was done.

1749
00:55:50,888 --> 00:55:54,451
I figure I just put a ring
on Brooke and be happy.

1750
00:55:54,452 --> 00:55:57,544
But now...

1751
00:55:57,545 --> 00:55:58,536

talents to South Beach, huh?

about the physical thing?

00:57:58,756 --> 00:57:59,567
Hey.

1828
00:57:59,568 --> 00:58:02,709
Hey, I see... I see
you ladies have met.

1829
00:58:02,710 --> 00:58:03,290
We did.

1830
00:58:03,291 --> 00:58:04,450
You know, I was
just telling Brooke

1831
00:58:04,451 --> 00:58:05,962
how great our
interviews were going.

1832
00:58:05,963 --> 00:58:07,624
I'm getting such
good stuff with you.

1833
00:58:07,625 --> 00:58:08,125
Really?

1834
00:58:08,126 --> 00:58:10,476
What kind of good stuff
are you getting, you know,

1835
00:58:10,477 --> 00:58:12,098
hanging around
other women's men?

1836
00:58:12,099 --> 00:58:12,950
Oh.

1837
00:58:12,951 --> 00:58:14,000
It's funny you should ask.

1838
00:58:14,001 --> 00:58:14,972
I think we should get going.

1839
00:58:14,973 --> 00:58:17,083
I feel a cat fight
cat coming on. [MEOWS]

1840
00:58:17,084 --> 00:58:19,375
Uh, Kent, you... you leaving?

1841
00:58:19,376 --> 00:58:20,297
You guys are laving?

1842
00:58:20,297 --> 00:58:20,798
Yeah.

1843
00:58:20,799 --> 00:58:21,799
Yeah, Kent, you can't leave.

1844
00:58:21,800 --> 00:58:25,031
The game is starting
to get really good.

1845
00:58:25,032 --> 00:58:26,292
Oh, really?

1846
00:58:26,293 --> 00:58:29,445
Then baby, we have to stay.

1847
00:58:29,446 --> 00:58:31,788
Hey, Brooke,
[PATS KNEE] you can

1848
00:58:31,789 --> 00:58:32,720
sit right here, if you want.

1849
00:58:32,721 --> 00:58:35,221
Hey, look here,
partner, I... mm-mm.

1850
00:58:35,222 --> 00:58:38,494
[STAMMERING] You see what I'm
dealing with here with, man?

1851
00:58:38,495 --> 00:58:39,246
Come on, man.

1852
00:58:39,247 --> 00:58:41,047
You gotta help me get
this under control.

1853
00:58:41,048 --> 00:58:43,760
Uh, you gotta love
they're trying.

1854
00:58:43,761 --> 00:58:46,092
Oh, Doug, damn it.

1855
00:58:46,093 --> 00:58:47,463
This is serious.

1856
00:58:47,464 --> 00:58:48,835
I need your help,
D. Come on, man.

1857
00:58:48,836 --> 00:58:50,376
Look at that D, Kent.

1858
00:58:50,377 --> 00:58:51,778
He's got the boy on lock.

1859
00:58:51,779 --> 00:58:54,530
Oh, the playoffs are going
to be bananas this year.

1860
00:58:54,531 --> 00:58:56,342
What are you doing?

1861
00:58:56,343 --> 00:58:58,785
Well, which one is Shaq?

1862
00:58:58,786 --> 00:59:00,436
Huh, baby?

1863
00:59:00,437 --> 00:59:01,428
I can't see him.

1864
00:59:01,429 --> 00:59:05,401
Uh, uh, he's... he's
not on the team, babe.

1865
00:59:05,402 --> 00:59:07,133
Yeah, he got traded
out, and the team

1866
00:59:07,134 --> 00:59:09,115
is so much stronger without him.

1867
00:59:09,116 --> 00:59:11,988
They just fit, don't
you think, Kent?

1868
00:59:11,989 --> 00:59:13,509
Yeah, well, they won
championships with him.

1869
00:59:13,510 --> 00:59:14,481
Right, baby?

1870
00:59:14,482 --> 00:59:17,023
Yeah, but everyone knows
that Kobe was they young star.

1871
00:59:17,024 --> 00:59:19,636
They traded out the old model
for something new and improved.

1872
00:59:19,637 --> 00:59:22,789
Oh, well, everyone thought
Kobe was Mr. Wonderful.

1873
00:59:22,790 --> 00:59:25,221
Then he got caught
with his pants down.

1874
00:59:25,222 --> 00:59:26,362
True, he was accused.

1875
00:59:26,363 --> 00:59:27,383
But the charges were dropped.

1876
00:59:27,384 --> 00:59:27,885
Yeah.

1877
00:59:27,886 --> 00:59:30,987
But he lost a lot behind that.

1878
00:59:30,988 --> 00:59:32,849
Well, he still has the team.

1879
00:59:32,850 --> 00:59:34,791
I guess when you get
right down to it,

1880
00:59:34,792 --> 00:59:36,032
he was just the better package.

1881
00:59:42,309 --> 00:59:44,570
Oh.

1882
00:59:44,571 --> 00:59:46,022
No, Brooke.

1883
00:59:46,023 --> 00:59:46,523
Baby.

1884
00:59:46,524 --> 00:59:49,425
You don't have to leave
on my account, all right?

1885
00:59:49,426 --> 00:59:51,357
I thought I was doing something
that would make you happy.

1886
00:59:51,358 --> 00:59:54,380
But clearly, I was wrong.

1887
00:59:54,381 --> 00:59:56,352
No, it's... it's...
It's not like that.

1888
00:59:56,353 --> 00:59:58,334
It's always like that, Kent.

1889
00:59:58,335 --> 01:00:00,306
Why is she even here?

1890
01:00:00,307 --> 01:00:02,849
You invited me to come
see the game with you.

1891
01:00:02,850 --> 01:00:05,321
God, you think William
would do this to my sister?

1892
01:00:05,322 --> 01:00:07,974
Oh.

1893
01:00:07,975 --> 01:00:10,006
You know what?

1894
01:00:10,007 --> 01:00:10,888
Don't follow me.

1895
01:00:10,888 --> 01:00:11,699
All right?

1896
01:00:11,700 --> 01:00:13,599
You just stay your ass here.

1897
01:00:13,600 --> 01:00:14,600
Aw.

1898
01:00:17,414 --> 01:00:19,245
Oh, shit.

1899
01:00:19,246 --> 01:00:20,217
Drive it to the hole!

1900
01:00:20,218 --> 01:00:21,668
Penetrate!

1901
01:00:21,669 --> 01:00:22,669
Ugh.

1902
01:00:30,968 --> 01:00:32,919
The playoffs are
gonna be good though.

1903
01:00:32,920 --> 01:00:34,370
There's some good match ups.

1904
01:00:34,371 --> 01:00:34,872
Yeah.

1905
01:00:34,873 --> 01:00:37,223
Yeah, it looks like it.

1906
01:00:37,224 --> 01:00:37,725
Wanna sit down?

1907
01:00:37,725 --> 01:00:38,225
Yeah.

1908
01:00:38,225 --> 01:00:39,196
That's cool.

1909
01:00:39,197 --> 01:00:41,627
That was a good game, right?

1910
01:00:41,628 --> 01:00:43,399
You see that three
pointer at the buzzer?

1911
01:00:43,400 --> 01:00:47,083
[WOOSH] That was hot.

1912
01:00:47,084 --> 01:00:47,584
Yeah.

1913
01:00:47,584 --> 01:00:48,584
Definitely.

1914
01:00:50,978 --> 01:00:53,309
Can I ask you a question?

1915
01:00:53,310 --> 01:00:55,121
Yeah, sure.

1916
01:00:55,122 --> 01:00:57,414
Is everything OK
with you and Brooke?

1917
01:01:01,749 --> 01:01:03,189
Off the record?

1918
01:01:03,190 --> 01:01:04,190
Off the record.

1919
01:01:08,025 --> 01:01:10,266
It could be better.

1920
01:01:10,267 --> 01:01:13,509
Oh, gotcha.

1921
01:01:13,510 --> 01:01:15,392
Brooke sure is a lucky girl.

1922
01:01:18,565 --> 01:01:20,526
Somebody should tell her that.

1923
01:01:20,527 --> 01:01:21,749
You don't think she knows?

1924
01:01:24,631 --> 01:01:29,505
I think Brooke sees
what she wants to see,

1925
01:01:29,506 --> 01:01:31,848
and that's unfortunate.

1926
01:01:31,849 --> 01:01:33,429
That's not a
Brooke thing, Kent.

1927
01:01:33,430 --> 01:01:35,281
That's a woman.

1928
01:01:35,282 --> 01:01:36,253
Trust me.

1929
01:01:36,254 --> 01:01:37,563
Yeah, I guess you're right.

1930
01:01:37,564 --> 01:01:41,327
But, I... I just don't know
what got into her today.

1931
01:01:41,328 --> 01:01:43,129
I mean, wilding on me like
that and then storming out?

1932
01:01:43,130 --> 01:01:47,513
I... I just... I don't know.

1933
01:01:47,514 --> 01:01:51,687
Well, speaking from
experience, women just

1934
01:01:51,688 --> 01:01:53,459
want to know that their
Mr. Right is really

1935
01:01:53,460 --> 01:01:55,321
who he says he is.

1936
01:01:55,322 --> 01:01:58,674
I mean, the last
thing you want to do

1937
01:01:58,675 --> 01:02:00,296
is come home two nights
before your wedding

1938
01:02:00,297 --> 01:02:02,297
and find your man in the
shower with your roommate.

1939
01:02:06,764 --> 01:02:08,144
True story?

1940
01:02:08,145 --> 01:02:10,907
Yeah.

1941
01:02:10,908 --> 01:02:12,749
That guy's an idiot.

1942
01:02:12,750 --> 01:02:14,751
Tell me about it.

1943
01:02:14,752 --> 01:02:15,932
Most are.

1944
01:02:15,933 --> 01:02:19,675
And maybe that's what
us women are afraid of.

1945
01:02:19,676 --> 01:02:21,798
But I haven't done anything.

1946
01:02:21,799 --> 01:02:24,070
And I mean, I keep on
getting tested, you know?

1947
01:02:24,071 --> 01:02:27,573
I'm just beginning to wonder
if it's even worth it anymore.

1948
01:02:27,574 --> 01:02:28,574
Really.

1949
01:02:30,918 --> 01:02:32,478
Well, call me sappy.

1950
01:02:32,479 --> 01:02:36,352
I mean, even with all the
craziness I've been through,

1951
01:02:36,353 --> 01:02:40,486
I still believe in soul mates.

1952
01:02:40,487 --> 01:02:43,790
What about you?

1953
01:02:43,791 --> 01:02:46,742
I believe people mess
things up all the time,

1954
01:02:46,743 --> 01:02:48,975
but you can't...
You can't hold it

1955
01:02:48,976 --> 01:02:50,636
over somebody's head forever.

1956
01:02:50,637 --> 01:02:51,388
You know what I mean?

1957
01:02:51,388 --> 01:02:52,059
It's just too much...

1958
01:02:52,060 --> 01:02:54,570
(BOTH) Pressure.

1959
01:02:54,571 --> 01:02:57,323
Yeah.

1960
01:02:57,324 --> 01:03:00,847
Yeah, I've... that pressure
thing can be really tricky.

1961
01:03:00,848 --> 01:03:04,080
It can make you think
in ways and do things

1962
01:03:04,081 --> 01:03:07,704
you wouldn't normally do
but maybe you need to do.

1963
01:03:10,367 --> 01:03:13,930
Have you ever felt like that?

1964
01:03:13,931 --> 01:03:18,664
Yeah, but, uh, you should
never act on those urges, right?

1965
01:03:18,665 --> 01:03:21,187
No, you should.

1966
01:03:21,188 --> 01:03:23,520
You just... you
shouldn't fight it.

1967
01:03:34,711 --> 01:03:37,633
Um.

1968
01:03:37,634 --> 01:03:40,837
Look, uh, uh, I can't.

1969
01:03:40,838 --> 01:03:44,080
I can't do this.

1970
01:03:44,081 --> 01:03:48,044
I... I gotta go, OK?

1971
01:03:48,045 --> 01:03:49,526
I gotta go.

1972
01:04:17,514 --> 01:04:18,035
It's a shame.

1973
01:04:18,036 --> 01:04:19,515
I mean, I shouldn't
be this good.

1974
01:04:19,516 --> 01:04:20,957
You know what I mean?

1975
01:04:20,958 --> 01:04:23,139
I mean, come on,
man, nothing but net,

1976
01:04:23,140 --> 01:04:25,701
to the bottom of the
net, with my eyes closed.

01:04:30,958 --> 01:04:35,161
Yo, Kent, what's
up with you, man?

1979
01:04:35,162 --> 01:04:36,562
You're right.

1980
01:04:36,563 --> 01:04:37,944
What is wrong with me?

1981
01:04:37,945 --> 01:04:40,516
I... I think Brooke's
right, though.

1982
01:04:40,517 --> 01:04:42,259
I... I don't see how
she could trust me.

1983
01:04:44,922 --> 01:04:46,722
What'd you do, K?

1984
01:04:46,723 --> 01:04:47,494
What'd you do?

1985
01:04:47,494 --> 01:04:48,365
KENT (OFFSCREEN): Nothing.

1986
01:04:48,366 --> 01:04:50,006
What'd you... don't...
You dirty... you...

1987
01:04:50,007 --> 01:04:51,757
No, your mind is in the gutter.

1988

You... you was here wit your...

1989

No, no, no, no, no.

1990
01:04:54,061 --> 01:04:54,891
Yes, you did.

1991

Yes.

Did you pound it like
this? [MAKING NOISES]

Hell no.

1996
01:05:00,347 --> 01:05:01,298
None of that.

Hey, Doug, can you,
um, give us a minute?

1998
01:05:04,261 --> 01:05:04,761

Yeah.

Absolutely.

01:13:29,706 --> 01:13:31,136
you were worth it.

2186
01:13:31,137 --> 01:13:32,008
OK.

2187
01:13:32,008 --> 01:13:32,919
You know what?
This is...

2188
01:13:32,919 --> 01:13:33,420
No, no.

2189
01:13:33,420 --> 01:13:34,400
Mandy, come on now.

2190
01:13:34,400 --> 01:13:34,901
Relax.

2191
01:13:34,901 --> 01:13:35,602
It's all good.

2192
01:13:35,602 --> 01:13:36,102
Chill.

2193
01:13:36,103 --> 01:13:37,573
I want you to see this.

2194
01:13:37,574 --> 01:13:39,635
I tried this before, but
it didn't go so well.

2195
01:13:39,636 --> 01:13:43,829
But, uh, this time I
think I got it right.

2196
01:13:43,830 --> 01:13:45,851
So let's lift our glasses.

2197
01:13:45,852 --> 01:13:47,983
Mandy, please, lift your glass.

2198
01:13:47,984 --> 01:13:49,625
Here's a toast.

2199
01:13:49,626 --> 01:13:51,827
Here's to no more tests.

2200
01:13:51,828 --> 01:13:53,018
Come on, Mandy.

2201
01:13:53,019 --> 01:13:56,401
No party pooper.

2202
01:13:56,402 --> 01:13:58,744
Mm.

2203
01:13:58,745 --> 01:13:59,686
Oh, yeah.

2204
01:13:59,687 --> 01:14:00,786
Oh, one more thing.

2205
01:14:00,787 --> 01:14:02,348
I got one more surprise for you.

2206
01:14:04,881 --> 01:14:05,951
This is the kicker.

2207
01:14:05,952 --> 01:14:07,963
You are going to love this.

2208
01:14:07,964 --> 01:14:08,964
OK.

2209
01:14:11,197 --> 01:14:14,660
All right-y.

2210
01:14:14,661 --> 01:14:15,661
What have we now?

2211
01:14:19,105 --> 01:14:20,506
Unbelievable.

2212
01:14:20,507 --> 01:14:23,629
Yeah, you both fail.

2213
01:14:23,630 --> 01:14:24,630
Brooke, uh-uh.

2214
01:14:27,113 --> 01:14:29,695
You know, I know I wasn't
perfect in our relationship.

2215
01:14:29,696 --> 01:14:32,498
But I was faithful
to you, even when

2216
01:14:32,499 --> 01:14:36,261
I had to face temptation
that you sent to me.

2217
01:14:36,262 --> 01:14:39,214
And the ironic thing is that
the... the one guy that you

2218
01:14:39,215 --> 01:14:42,477
compare me to, the one
person that you think

2219
01:14:42,478 --> 01:14:46,331
is just totally perfect,
Sophia's Mr. Wonderful...

2220
01:14:46,332 --> 01:14:47,924
He couldn't even pass this test.

2221
01:14:51,548 --> 01:14:52,949
Good evening, ladies.

2222
01:15:04,521 --> 01:15:05,681
How did he get this, Mandy?

2223
01:15:13,249 --> 01:15:14,249
Mm.

2224
01:15:22,619 --> 01:15:23,600
Sophia?

2225
01:15:23,601 --> 01:15:26,061
I'm in here, honey.

2226
01:15:26,062 --> 01:15:27,402
You know, we were
expecting to see you

2227
01:15:27,403 --> 01:15:29,875
last night seeing as though you
thought Kent was gonna propose

2228
01:15:29,876 --> 01:15:32,297
and everything.

2229
01:15:32,298 --> 01:15:36,652
Yeah, well, I was
wrong about that.

2230
01:15:36,653 --> 01:15:37,644
Girl, don't worry, honey.

2231
01:15:37,645 --> 01:15:39,074
That man is gonna
propose because I

2232
01:15:39,075 --> 01:15:40,626
can see how much he loves you.

2233
01:15:40,627 --> 01:15:41,627
No, Sophia.

2234
01:15:41,628 --> 01:15:44,810
I was really wrong.

2235
01:15:44,811 --> 01:15:46,652
What happened?

2236
01:15:46,653 --> 01:15:50,095
Kent found out that I
hired the man stealer.

2237
01:15:50,096 --> 01:15:53,959
Now he won't speak to me.

2238
01:15:53,960 --> 01:15:54,741
Wow.

2239
01:15:54,742 --> 01:15:57,663
Yeah.

2240
01:15:57,664 --> 01:16:02,447
Anyways, it was pretty dramatic.

2241
01:16:02,448 --> 01:16:04,319
I'm sorry, Brooke.

2242
01:16:04,320 --> 01:16:05,701
But you know what?

2243
01:16:05,702 --> 01:16:07,082
I can't blame him.

2244
01:16:07,083 --> 01:16:08,463
I'm sorry, honey.

2245
01:16:08,464 --> 01:16:11,356
People don't always
want to be tested.

2246
01:16:11,357 --> 01:16:11,858
Look.

2247
01:16:11,859 --> 01:16:14,509
OK, baby, look, OK,
you made a mistake.

2248
01:16:14,510 --> 01:16:15,921
OK, people make mistakes.

2249
01:16:15,922 --> 01:16:17,943
It happens.

2250
01:16:17,944 --> 01:16:20,946
But love... love can
cover up all the hurt

2251
01:16:20,947 --> 01:16:22,918
that we cause other people.

2252
01:16:22,919 --> 01:16:24,880
Well...

2253
01:16:24,881 --> 01:16:26,842
What?

2254
01:16:26,843 --> 01:16:29,004
Kent said something
about William.

2255
01:16:29,005 --> 01:16:30,316
[SCOFFS] What?

2256
01:16:33,169 --> 01:16:36,321
He said that, um...

2257
01:16:36,322 --> 01:16:36,823
What?

2258
01:16:36,824 --> 01:16:39,554
Something about he didn't
pass the test himself?

2259
01:16:39,555 --> 01:16:40,536
What?

2260
01:16:40,537 --> 01:16:42,297
You know what?

2261
01:16:42,298 --> 01:16:44,660
Don't.

2262
01:16:44,661 --> 01:16:46,171
Don't even go there, OK?

2263
01:16:46,172 --> 01:16:48,063
Because it's not
about me and William.

2264
01:16:48,064 --> 01:16:48,564
All right?

2265
01:16:48,565 --> 01:16:51,516
And whatever you think
you know, you don't.

2266
01:16:51,517 --> 01:16:52,458
OK?

2267
01:16:52,458 --> 01:16:53,169
Sophia.

2268
01:16:53,170 --> 01:16:54,499
What, Brooke?

2269
01:16:54,500 --> 01:16:55,500
What are you saying?

2270
01:16:58,064 --> 01:16:59,334
Sophia, come on.

2271
01:16:59,335 --> 01:17:01,126
You and William are
like the ideal couple.

2272
01:17:01,127 --> 01:17:02,347
OK, so what?

2273
01:17:02,348 --> 01:17:03,229
Yes, we have problems.

2274
01:17:03,229 --> 01:17:03,740
We do.

2275
01:17:03,740 --> 01:17:04,681
Oh, gosh.

2276
01:17:04,682 --> 01:17:06,121
We do.

2277
01:17:06,122 --> 01:17:10,315
You have to stop
comparing yourself to me.

2278
01:17:10,316 --> 01:17:11,107
Be you, honey.

2279
01:17:11,108 --> 01:17:13,028
Do you.

2280
01:17:13,029 --> 01:17:14,319
Just because we
have problems... that

2281
01:17:14,320 --> 01:17:17,753
doesn't mean that you and Kent
are going to have problems, OK?

2282
01:17:17,754 --> 01:17:19,995
People put too much
demand on love and this

2283
01:17:19,996 --> 01:17:21,727
and that and the other, OK?

2284
01:17:21,728 --> 01:17:23,949
If you love that man,
then be with that man.

2285
01:17:23,950 --> 01:17:27,683
But stop testing that man.

2286
01:17:27,684 --> 01:17:29,194
Call him.

2287
01:17:29,195 --> 01:17:31,026
I don't know how much
good that's gonna do.

2288
01:17:31,027 --> 01:17:32,858
Listen, honey.

2289
01:17:32,859 --> 01:17:34,439
Call him.

2290
01:17:34,440 --> 01:17:37,192
And you tell him you're sorry.

2291
01:17:37,193 --> 01:17:38,503
And even if he's
not listening, you

2292
01:17:38,504 --> 01:17:42,779
keep telling him over and over
and over, until he does listen.

2293
01:17:45,581 --> 01:17:46,973
But you gotta be
ready to change.

2294
01:17:49,726 --> 01:17:51,257
And you gotta be ready to trust.

2295
01:17:53,860 --> 01:17:54,741
You hear me?

2296
01:17:54,742 --> 01:17:56,251
I hear you.

2297
01:17:56,252 --> 01:17:58,344
Stop comparing yourself to me.

2298
01:18:01,227 --> 01:18:03,909
Hey, baby.

2299
01:18:03,910 --> 01:18:05,841
Oh, let me guess.

2300
01:18:05,842 --> 01:18:09,314
Y'all must be talking
about men again.

2301
01:18:09,315 --> 01:18:10,756
[CHUCKLES]

2302
01:18:10,757 --> 01:18:12,597
You know it.

2303
01:18:12,598 --> 01:18:13,169
All right, baby.

2304
01:18:13,170 --> 01:18:15,250
I'll be in here if
you need me, OK?

2305
01:18:15,251 --> 01:18:16,251
OK.

2306
01:18:27,643 --> 01:18:30,345
And, uh, you know, thanks
to Mr. Hartsfield Jr,

2307
01:18:30,346 --> 01:18:32,337
who is well into his 90s.

2308
01:18:32,338 --> 01:18:33,939
And to this very
day, every Saturday,

2309
01:18:33,940 --> 01:18:35,250
he still comes here
and volunteers.

2310
01:18:35,251 --> 01:18:35,742
Yeah.

2311
01:18:35,743 --> 01:18:36,902
He's a great guy, too.

2312
01:18:36,903 --> 01:18:37,513
Yeah.

2313
01:18:37,513 --> 01:18:38,364
Real cool.

2314
01:18:38,365 --> 01:18:40,385
Um, but if you
look over here, we

2315
01:18:40,386 --> 01:18:42,477
have examples of
some of the equipment

2316
01:18:42,478 --> 01:18:45,600
that they used, like, in
the '30s, '40s, '50s, '60s.

2317
01:18:45,601 --> 01:18:46,962
Uh, somebody die?

2318
01:18:46,963 --> 01:18:48,984
On your way to a funeral?

2319
01:18:48,985 --> 01:18:50,175
He doesn't want
to see you, Mandy.

2320
01:18:50,176 --> 01:18:50,676
So...

2321
01:18:50,677 --> 01:18:51,877
Oh, no, no, no.

2322
01:18:51,878 --> 01:18:52,648
It's OK, man.

2323
01:18:52,649 --> 01:18:56,291
I mean, unless she here to do
something for your profile.

2324
01:18:56,292 --> 01:18:57,302
Mandy, right?

2325
01:18:57,303 --> 01:18:58,874
That's your name?

2326
01:18:58,875 --> 01:18:59,375
Mandy?

2327
01:18:59,375 --> 01:18:59,876
Is that her?

2328
01:18:59,877 --> 01:19:02,447
I just came here
to apologize to you.

2329
01:19:02,448 --> 01:19:04,009
I'm really sorry,
Kent, for everything...

2330
01:19:04,010 --> 01:19:04,911
No, no, no.

2331
01:19:04,912 --> 01:19:07,012
You don't have to apologize, OK?

2332
01:19:07,013 --> 01:19:08,944
'Cause we're done.

2333
01:19:08,945 --> 01:19:10,226
Kent, I said I'm sorry.

2334
01:19:13,709 --> 01:19:16,171
I mean, was it some kind
of game or something?

2335
01:19:16,172 --> 01:19:17,522
A challenge?

2336
01:19:17,523 --> 01:19:18,673
Does it really matter?

2337
01:19:18,674 --> 01:19:20,615
Hell yeah.

2338
01:19:20,616 --> 01:19:23,258
(WHISPERING) I put myself
out there like that.

2339
01:19:23,259 --> 01:19:24,639
You get that?

2340
01:19:24,640 --> 01:19:25,621
I understand, Kent.

2341
01:19:25,622 --> 01:19:30,896
You know, I... I felt things too.

2342
01:19:30,897 --> 01:19:33,949
I feel things for you, things
I didn't expect to feel.

2343
01:19:33,950 --> 01:19:41,526
I... at the end of the
day, you are not mine.

2344
01:19:41,527 --> 01:19:42,979
You're hers, and I get that.

2345
01:19:49,806 --> 01:19:52,207
And to answer your question, no.

2346
01:19:52,208 --> 01:19:53,738
It wasn't a game.

2347
01:19:53,739 --> 01:19:58,323
But if you want my advice,
don't take the easy way out.

2348
01:19:58,324 --> 01:19:59,324
Forgive Brooke.

2349
01:20:05,771 --> 01:20:07,362
Stop it.

2350
01:20:07,363 --> 01:20:10,395
And rejection has never been
something that has bothered us

2351
01:20:10,396 --> 01:20:12,839
or deterred us,
ever, especially me.

2352
01:20:21,747 --> 01:20:25,430
I was not expecting
to feel like this.

2353
01:20:25,431 --> 01:20:28,583
[SIGHS] What was I thinking?

2354
01:20:28,584 --> 01:20:30,635
Wow, you really liked him.

2355
01:20:30,636 --> 01:20:33,588
I... [KNOCK_ON_DOOR] Who's that?

2356
01:20:33,589 --> 01:20:34,589
Hmm.

2357
01:20:41,487 --> 01:20:41,988
Hi.

2358
01:20:41,989 --> 01:20:45,440
Uh, Mandy?

2359
01:20:45,441 --> 01:20:47,903
Can I come in?

2360
01:20:47,904 --> 01:20:48,904
Sure.

2361
01:20:52,378 --> 01:20:53,919
Are you... are you good?

2362
01:20:53,920 --> 01:20:54,891
I'm good.

2363
01:20:54,891 --> 01:20:55,391
OK.

2364
01:20:55,392 --> 01:20:57,332
I'll... I'll call you later.

2365
01:20:57,333 --> 01:20:57,833
OK.

2366
01:20:57,833 --> 01:20:58,434
Thanks, Nat.

2367
01:20:58,434 --> 01:20:59,305
NATALIE (OFFSCREEN): Yeah.

2368
01:20:59,305 --> 01:21:00,305
Mm-hmm.

2369
01:21:05,671 --> 01:21:08,553
Look, if you're looking for a
fight, Brooke, this is not it.

2370
01:21:08,554 --> 01:21:10,055
No, I'm not.

2371
01:21:10,056 --> 01:21:15,131
I... I'm here to say that
you were right, sort of.

2372
01:21:18,004 --> 01:21:19,004
Have a seat.

2373
01:21:28,434 --> 01:21:34,319
This test... it was
a bad, bad idea.

2374
01:21:34,320 --> 01:21:35,001
I don't know.

2375
01:21:35,002 --> 01:21:39,044
I was hoping to find
something horrible about Kent.

2376
01:21:39,045 --> 01:21:42,948
I just found something
horrible about myself.

2377
01:21:42,949 --> 01:21:48,763
Well, for whatever it's worth,
this has never happened before.

2378
01:21:48,764 --> 01:21:50,845
And I could tell when
I met Kent that this

2379
01:21:50,846 --> 01:21:53,098
was gonna be different.

2380
01:21:53,099 --> 01:21:55,400
He really is a great guy.

2381
01:21:55,401 --> 01:21:57,732
Yeah.

2382
01:21:57,733 --> 01:22:00,815
1%, right?

2383
01:22:00,816 --> 01:22:02,317
You said it.

2384
01:22:02,318 --> 01:22:03,318
Yeah.

2385
01:22:03,319 --> 01:22:07,322
Yeah, he's a... he's a
great guy, isn't he?

2386
01:22:07,323 --> 01:22:08,793
It took me too long
to realize that,

2387
01:22:08,794 --> 01:22:10,635
and now he won't speak to me.

2388
01:22:10,636 --> 01:22:11,916
So...

2389
01:22:11,917 --> 01:22:14,349
You're not the only
one he won't speak to.

2390
01:22:14,350 --> 01:22:16,211
He'll forgive you for that.

2391
01:22:16,212 --> 01:22:18,974
You know, it's not your fault.

2392
01:22:18,975 --> 01:22:20,535
Me, not so much.

2393
01:22:20,536 --> 01:22:25,720
Look, Brooke, to be
honest, I could have

2394
01:22:25,721 --> 01:22:28,063
and I should have stopped it.

2395
01:22:28,064 --> 01:22:31,896
But with the bet between
you and I and Kent

2396
01:22:31,897 --> 01:22:34,829
being such a challenge, I just...
I wasn't thinking straight.

2397
01:22:34,830 --> 01:22:37,932
Me and my challenges.

2398
01:22:37,933 --> 01:22:39,445
Mandy, you were
only doing your job.

2399
01:22:42,508 --> 01:22:44,479
Me, not so much.

2400
01:22:44,480 --> 01:22:48,573
You know, I haven't
been a good girlfriend.

2401
01:22:48,574 --> 01:22:49,724
So I don't blame
Kent if he never

2402
01:22:49,725 --> 01:22:51,907
wants to see me again or
give me another chance.

2403
01:22:54,630 --> 01:22:56,270
And honestly, I don't
deserve another one.

2404
01:22:59,955 --> 01:23:07,955
So, um, I guess you
won on a technicality.

2405
01:23:08,284 --> 01:23:12,297
Well, you did gift wrapped
him and sent him to me.

2406
01:23:12,298 --> 01:23:14,979
You don't have anything
to worry about, Brooke.

2407
01:23:14,980 --> 01:23:18,923
He's coming back to
you, return to sender.

2408
01:23:18,924 --> 01:23:21,807
Yeah, well, we'll
see about that.

2409
01:23:25,181 --> 01:23:29,444
Does your fee include
a... a drink on the house?

2410
01:23:29,445 --> 01:23:30,665
I think I can make that happen.

2411
01:23:30,666 --> 01:23:33,628
Woo, thank you.

2412
01:23:33,629 --> 01:23:36,481
K. K, have you been listening
to what I'm saying, brah?

2413
01:23:36,482 --> 01:23:38,773
I brought you here to
get you out of your funk.

2414
01:23:38,774 --> 01:23:39,814
Look around.

2415
01:23:39,815 --> 01:23:42,617
Booty, booty, booty,
booty rocking everywhere.

2416
01:23:42,618 --> 01:23:43,668
What's up, baby?

2417
01:23:43,669 --> 01:23:44,909
Come on.

2418
01:23:44,910 --> 01:23:45,741
Look around you.

2419
01:23:45,742 --> 01:23:46,921
Look... at all these
women in here.

2420
01:23:46,922 --> 01:23:47,493
Look at that one.

2421
01:23:47,494 --> 01:23:49,023
She got low self
esteem right there.

2422
01:23:49,024 --> 01:23:50,595
That's good for you.

2423
01:23:50,596 --> 01:23:52,297
You want somebody
in your lowly state.

2424
01:23:52,298 --> 01:23:53,538
You know what I'm saying?

2425
01:23:53,539 --> 01:23:55,991
To get back in the saddle,
if you know what I mean.

2426
01:24:00,836 --> 01:24:02,777
No, it's not gonna happen, man?

2427
01:24:02,778 --> 01:24:04,028
Why not?

2428
01:24:04,029 --> 01:24:04,880
Why not, Kent?

2429
01:24:04,880 --> 01:24:05,381
Huh?

2430
01:24:05,381 --> 01:24:05,941
Why not?

2431
01:24:05,942 --> 01:24:06,971
You got eye problems?

2432
01:24:06,972 --> 01:24:10,325
Look around.

2433
01:24:10,326 --> 01:24:12,237
Eh.

2434
01:24:12,238 --> 01:24:15,590
I'll pass.

2435
01:24:15,591 --> 01:24:18,052
Who are you, and what have
you done with my friend Kent?

2436
01:24:18,053 --> 01:24:19,274
Stop it, OK?

2437
01:24:19,275 --> 01:24:20,395
Stop it.

2438
01:24:20,396 --> 01:24:21,786
I know seven dudes
right now that'd

2439
01:24:21,787 --> 01:24:23,218
give their left one
to have your problem.

2440
01:24:23,219 --> 01:24:25,290
What is wrong with you?

2441
01:24:25,291 --> 01:24:26,941
That's just what it is, though.

2442
01:24:26,942 --> 01:24:28,223
It's a problem.

2443
01:24:28,224 --> 01:24:28,774
It is not.

2444
01:24:28,774 --> 01:24:29,485
I don't what to do.

2445
01:24:29,486 --> 01:24:31,566
It is not a... both of
them, at the same dang

2446
01:24:31,567 --> 01:24:34,809
time, a menage a three,
menage a four if she a Gemini.

2447
01:24:34,810 --> 01:24:35,501
Look, do it.

2448
01:24:35,502 --> 01:24:36,651
Oh, man, damn.

2449
01:24:36,652 --> 01:24:38,753
You play too much.

2450
01:24:38,754 --> 01:24:40,165
This is serious, man.

2451
01:24:40,166 --> 01:24:41,196
Kent, Kent, hold on.

2452
01:24:41,197 --> 01:24:41,937
Hold on.
Hold on.

2453
01:24:41,937 --> 01:24:42,438
All right.

2454
01:24:42,438 --> 01:24:43,028
Let's talk.

2455
01:24:43,028 --> 01:24:43,529
Let's talk.

2456
01:24:43,530 --> 01:24:44,959
No, let's talk.

2457
01:24:44,960 --> 01:24:45,811
All right?

2458
01:24:45,811 --> 01:24:46,562
Wow, I'm Not.

2459
01:24:46,563 --> 01:24:47,832
Really good at this,
so I'm just going

2460
01:24:47,833 --> 01:24:48,943
to give it to you straight.

2461
01:24:48,944 --> 01:24:50,845
Um, you acting
like a girl, dude.

2462
01:24:50,846 --> 01:24:53,908
This is your idea
of being serious?

2463
01:24:53,909 --> 01:24:54,909
Excuse me.

2464
01:25:02,017 --> 01:25:03,918
Oh.

2465
01:25:03,919 --> 01:25:05,940
So you are serious.

2466
01:25:05,941 --> 01:25:07,091
What's up?

2467
01:25:07,092 --> 01:25:08,943
What's up is that
your... your choice

2468
01:25:08,944 --> 01:25:12,297
really isn't that
confusing, K. It's Brooke.

2469
01:25:12,298 --> 01:25:12,838
Yeah, look.

2470
01:25:12,838 --> 01:25:13,189
I know.

2471
01:25:13,189 --> 01:25:13,689
I know.

2472
01:25:13,690 --> 01:25:15,660
I know I've been rooting
for the visiting team.

2473
01:25:15,661 --> 01:25:17,312
But I'm saying, over the
last couple of weeks,

2474
01:25:17,313 --> 01:25:18,863
man, she showed me something.

2475
01:25:18,864 --> 01:25:20,575
Yeah.

2476
01:25:20,576 --> 01:25:22,287
Hey, I guess that's
the problem too.

2477
01:25:22,288 --> 01:25:26,030
Like, I know what I'm
getting with Brooke.

2478
01:25:26,031 --> 01:25:27,402
But I'm kind of
wondering what it

2479
01:25:27,403 --> 01:25:28,643
would be like to get with Mandy.

2480
01:25:28,644 --> 01:25:29,145
Right?

2481
01:25:29,145 --> 01:25:30,065
Right?

2482
01:25:30,066 --> 01:25:31,406
Stop wondering, OK?

2483
01:25:31,407 --> 01:25:32,467
Stop, OK?

2484
01:25:32,468 --> 01:25:33,349
Stop.

2485
01:25:33,350 --> 01:25:34,579
We got a purpose in life.

2486
01:25:34,580 --> 01:25:36,721
God put us here
for a reason, OK?

2487
01:25:36,722 --> 01:25:39,524
Mine... [POUNDS HANDS
TOGETHER] Stop.

2488
01:25:39,525 --> 01:25:40,725
You really need
to make that sound?

2489
01:25:40,726 --> 01:25:41,247
That's me.
That's me.

2490
01:25:41,247 --> 01:25:42,168
This... yes.

2491
01:25:42,168 --> 01:25:43,018
Stop, don't run.

2492
01:25:43,018 --> 01:25:43,669
Wow.

2493
01:25:43,669 --> 01:25:44,550
- Don't run.
- Wow.

2494
01:25:44,550 --> 01:25:45,110
That's me.

2495
01:25:45,110 --> 01:25:45,611
All right?

2496
01:25:45,612 --> 01:25:48,673
You the one that thinks
with his big brain.

2497
01:25:48,674 --> 01:25:49,994
Not according to Brooke.

2498
01:25:49,995 --> 01:25:53,258
Look, brah, I know
Mandy is hot, all right?

2499
01:25:53,259 --> 01:25:54,529
I'm saying she's sexy.

2500
01:25:54,530 --> 01:25:56,351
She's got junk in the trunk.

2501
01:25:56,352 --> 01:25:58,613
Legs be all smooth
looking, and toes

2502
01:25:58,614 --> 01:26:03,107
be just thicker than a $4
milkshake and grits on Monday.

2503
01:26:03,108 --> 01:26:07,522
I'm telling you, baby...
Where was I going?

2504
01:26:07,523 --> 01:26:08,294
I don't know.

2505
01:26:08,295 --> 01:26:09,764
But I like where you were at.

2506
01:26:09,765 --> 01:26:10,386
Stop.

2507
01:26:10,387 --> 01:26:11,526
Stop, stop, stop.

2508
01:26:11,527 --> 01:26:14,619
The point... the point
is, yes, Mandy's hot.

2509
01:26:14,620 --> 01:26:18,763
But dawg, she's a fantasy, man.

2510
01:26:18,764 --> 01:26:19,375
And trust me.

2511
01:26:19,376 --> 01:26:22,577
I know a thing or
two about fantasies.

2512
01:26:22,578 --> 01:26:26,080
You don't wanna end up
like me, chasing fantasies.

2513
01:26:26,081 --> 01:26:26,982
All right.

2514
01:26:26,983 --> 01:26:28,783
All right.

2515
01:26:28,784 --> 01:26:30,585
So what are you trying
to say, Confucius?

2516
01:26:30,586 --> 01:26:32,267
Well, grasshopper,
what I'm saying

2517
01:26:32,268 --> 01:26:35,300
is the grass isn't
always greener.

2518
01:26:35,301 --> 01:26:36,811
Tend to your own lawn.

2519
01:26:36,812 --> 01:26:37,982
Keep watering the
grass you've been

2520
01:26:37,983 --> 01:26:41,576
watering for the
past four years, man.

2521
01:26:41,577 --> 01:26:46,080
Brooke loves you,
K. She loves you.

2522
01:26:46,081 --> 01:26:46,582
So what?

2523
01:26:46,582 --> 01:26:47,293
She made a mistake.

2524
01:26:47,294 --> 01:26:48,893
Big deal.

2525
01:26:48,894 --> 01:26:50,094
OK, everybody makes mistakes.

2526
01:26:50,095 --> 01:26:50,596
You too.

2527
01:26:50,596 --> 01:26:51,096
Stop playing.

2528
01:26:51,097 --> 01:26:52,987
Stop sitting over there,
acting like you... you all Mr.

2529
01:26:52,988 --> 01:26:55,189
Innocent, like you
ain't... come on, son.

2530
01:26:55,190 --> 01:26:55,931
Stop.

2531
01:26:55,932 --> 01:26:59,073
You know?

2532
01:26:59,074 --> 01:27:00,395
I mean, dawg,
without forgiveness,

2533
01:27:00,396 --> 01:27:01,847
how this love thing gonna work?

2534
01:27:05,060 --> 01:27:06,921
That's deep, man.

2535
01:27:06,922 --> 01:27:07,493
Run that back.

2536
01:27:07,494 --> 01:27:10,845
Say that again, the...
The forgiveness thing.

2537
01:27:10,846 --> 01:27:12,967
Oh, I... I said
that, you know, how

2538
01:27:12,968 --> 01:27:16,591
this love thing gonna
work without forgiveness?

2539
01:27:16,592 --> 01:27:17,962

2721
01:36:18,043 --> 01:36:19,044
I failed.

2722
01:37:03,919 --> 01:37:05,319
Hey, I remember you.

2723
01:37:05,320 --> 01:37:05,820
Hey.

2724
01:37:05,821 --> 01:37:07,771
Are you here to
cause more fireworks?

2725
01:37:07,772 --> 01:37:10,774
Something like that.

2726
01:37:10,775 --> 01:37:14,408
Kenton Hughes and Brooke Moore
represent some of my best work.

2727
01:37:14,409 --> 01:37:15,310
They love each other a lot.

2728
01:37:15,311 --> 01:37:17,041
They've been together
for about four years,

2729
01:37:17,042 --> 01:37:18,974
and they just needed a
little help remembering.

2730
01:37:22,747 --> 01:37:25,779
Thanks for coming.

2731
01:37:25,780 --> 01:37:27,933
You know, I like pork chops.

2732
01:37:32,797 --> 01:37:37,781
Hey, listen, these
last few weeks

2733
01:37:37,782 --> 01:37:42,466
haven't really been anything
to write home about.

2734
01:37:42,467 --> 01:37:46,510
And, uh, there's
still some things

2735
01:37:46,511 --> 01:37:47,871
that we definitely
need to discuss.

2736
01:37:51,406 --> 01:37:53,858
I mean, you're saying that you
don't deserve another chance.

2737
01:37:56,451 --> 01:37:58,923
But it's not about deserving.

2738
01:37:58,924 --> 01:38:01,336
I mean, who can say I...
I deserve your love?

2739
01:38:04,089 --> 01:38:08,513
Without forgiveness, this love
thing doesn't stand a chance.

2740
01:38:13,218 --> 01:38:21,218
Look, um, about that test,
I, uh... I owe you an apology.

2741
01:38:23,528 --> 01:38:26,080
No.

2742
01:38:26,081 --> 01:38:29,924
Kent, this isn't your fault.

2743
01:38:29,925 --> 01:38:32,045
And I can't sit here and let
you apologize like it is.

2744
01:38:35,400 --> 01:38:37,901
Are either of us perfect?

2745
01:38:37,902 --> 01:38:40,084
No.

2746
01:38:40,085 --> 01:38:43,887
And we never will be.

2747
01:38:43,888 --> 01:38:46,670
But I put us in this position.

2748
01:38:46,671 --> 01:38:50,644
And baby, if your heart...
If it's big enough to let me

2749
01:38:50,645 --> 01:38:55,779
back in, Kent, I promise
you I will do my part

2750
01:38:55,780 --> 01:38:58,752
to fill your heart with
everything that I have,

2751
01:38:58,753 --> 01:38:59,534
all of me.

2752
01:38:59,535 --> 01:39:00,645
I promise you that.

2753
01:39:03,348 --> 01:39:05,339
I like that.

2754
01:39:05,340 --> 01:39:06,340
I like that.

2755
01:39:09,684 --> 01:39:11,615
There's something else.

2756
01:39:11,616 --> 01:39:14,008
[CLEARS THROAT]

2757
01:39:14,009 --> 01:39:15,009
What?

2758
01:39:17,412 --> 01:39:19,183
I love you, Kenton Hughes.

2759
01:39:19,184 --> 01:39:20,665
I love you too, baby.

2760
01:39:23,618 --> 01:39:25,100
Will you have me?

2761
01:39:30,535 --> 01:39:32,657
You know, that... that's funny.

2762
01:39:35,530 --> 01:39:39,843
Um, [CLEARS THROAT]

2763
01:39:39,844 --> 01:39:41,486
I was about to ask
you the same thing.

2764
01:39:44,259 --> 01:39:46,740
Will you marry me?

2765
01:39:46,741 --> 01:39:47,512
Yes, baby.

2766
01:39:47,512 --> 01:39:48,512
Yeah?

2767
01:39:50,735 --> 01:39:53,557
My goober.

2768
01:39:53,558 --> 01:39:55,009
I love you.

2769
01:39:55,010 --> 01:39:55,970
I love you, too.

2770
01:39:55,971 --> 01:39:57,421
Put this on.

2771
01:39:57,422 --> 01:40:00,314
Make it official.

2772
01:40:00,315 --> 01:40:01,756
Ah, perfect.

2773
01:40:04,469 --> 01:40:06,260
Waitress, champagne please.

2774
01:40:06,261 --> 01:40:08,942
We are celebrating.

2775
01:40:08,943 --> 01:40:10,654
That's for you.

2776
01:40:10,655 --> 01:40:11,486
Perfect fit too.

2777
01:40:11,487 --> 01:40:14,978
I know, right? [INAUDIBLE]

2778
01:40:14,979 --> 01:40:16,390
I love you.

2779
01:40:16,391 --> 01:40:18,752
I love you too, baby.

2780
01:40:18,753 --> 01:40:22,256
Jennifer, sweetie, can you
run this over to table four?

2781
01:40:22,257 --> 01:40:23,257
Thank you.

2782
01:40:26,741 --> 01:40:28,262
Brooke and I learned
a couple of things,

2783
01:40:28,263 --> 01:40:30,474
mainly that love is
not about pass or fail.

2784
01:40:30,475 --> 01:40:33,207
It's about honesty and
commitment and trust.

2785
01:40:33,208 --> 01:40:37,731
I learned a few other too,
girl, but we won't go into that.

2786
01:40:37,732 --> 01:40:38,623
But you look good, Brenda.

2787
01:40:38,624 --> 01:40:39,893
It's good to see you.

2788
01:40:39,894 --> 01:40:41,045
You too.

2789
01:40:41,046 --> 01:40:41,546
Thank you.

2790
01:40:41,547 --> 01:40:44,798
Can I buy the lady a drink?

2791
01:40:44,799 --> 01:40:46,660
That depends.

2792
01:40:46,661 --> 01:40:48,392
On?

2793
01:40:48,393 --> 01:40:50,894
Tell me my drink.

2794
01:40:50,895 --> 01:40:52,206
Hmm.

2795
01:40:52,207 --> 01:40:59,383
That would be a pearl
lemon drop martini to go.

2796
01:40:59,384 --> 01:41:01,185
Yup, babe, my
work here is done.

2797
01:41:01,186 --> 01:41:02,726
Yeah, mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

2798
01:41:02,727 --> 01:41:06,910
If you ever need my
services, call me.

2799
01:41:06,911 --> 01:41:07,912
I will.

2800
01:41:12,897 --> 01:41:14,818
Who's gonna call
whose parents first?

2801
01:41:14,819 --> 01:41:16,300
I don't know.

2802
01:41:16,301 --> 01:41:18,252
Girl, you probably should
because your dad doesn't really

2803
01:41:18,253 --> 01:41:18,753
like me.

2804
01:41:18,754 --> 01:41:21,285
No, he'll love
you, just like I do.

2805
01:41:21,286 --> 01:41:22,046
Oh.

2806
01:41:22,046 --> 01:41:23,046
Thank you.

2807
01:41:30,165 --> 01:41:31,755
Congratulations, you two.

2808
01:41:31,756 --> 01:41:33,277
You did it.

2809
01:41:33,278 --> 01:41:35,409
It's from Mandy.

2810
01:41:35,410 --> 01:41:36,650
Oh.

2811
01:41:36,651 --> 01:41:37,612
Right?

2812
01:41:37,612 --> 01:41:38,603
That's nice of her.

2813
01:41:38,603 --> 01:41:39,594
That's great.

2814
01:41:39,595 --> 01:41:41,245
And we did do it.

2815
01:41:41,246 --> 01:41:42,576
Yes, we did.

2816
01:41:42,577 --> 01:41:50,577
